<i>Does he love me, I wanna know</i>

00:25.285 --> 00:28.856
<i>How can I tell if he loves me so</i>

00:28.957 --> 00:32.787
<i>Is it in his eyes?
Oh no, you'll be deceived</i>

00:32.888 --> 00:36.650
<i>Is it in his eyes?
Oh no, he'll make believe</i>

00:36.750 --> 00:40.423
<i>If you wanna know if he loves you so</i>

00:40.524 --> 00:44.400
<i>It's in his kiss
That's where it is, oh yeah</i>

00:44.500 --> 00:48.401
<i>Or is it in his face?
Oh no, it's just his charm</i>

00:48.501 --> 00:52.501
<i>In his one embrace
Oh no, that's just his arm</i>

00:52.602 --> 00:56.289
<i>If you wanna know if he loves you so</i>

00:56.389 --> 00:59.276
<i>It's in his kiss
That's where it is</i>

00:59.376 --> 01:03.136
<i>Oh oh, it's in his kiss
That's where it is</i>

01:03.236 --> 01:08.210
<i>Oh oh oh
Hug him and squeeze him tight</i>

01:08.310 --> 01:12.257
<i>And find out what you wanna know</i>

01:12.357 --> 01:16.211
<i>If it's love, if it really is</i>

01:16.311 --> 01:19.648
<i>It's there in his kiss...</i>

01:21.154 --> 01:23.990
"Beautiful stranger,
red hair, green jump suit,...

01:24.116 --> 01:26.523
walking dogs in
Washington Square Park."

01:26.660 --> 01:30.195
"Can't forget you.
Give love a chance. Blackie."

01:30.330 --> 01:32.323
Hope she gives him a chance.

01:32.457 --> 01:35.494
Oh, Roberta, please!
He must be some kind of a pervert!

01:35.627 --> 01:38.830
- He could be sincere.
- Nobody named Blackie is sincere.

01:38.964 --> 01:41.372
He can't forget her,
he's in love. It's great.

01:41.508 --> 01:43.501
Weren't you reading the want ads?

01:43.635 --> 01:47.170
I know, I was. I just...
can't seem to find anything.

01:47.306 --> 01:49.547
Don't settle for
anything under 50,000.

01:49.683 --> 01:52.091
- Hi, ladies!
- Hi, Adrian. What do you think?

01:52.227 --> 01:55.596
- Roberta, the look is you.
- I just really wanted a trim.

01:55.731 --> 01:57.770
No, this is your birthday present.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.188
Give her something
different, not weird...

02:00.319 --> 02:02.988
Don't worry. Her husband'll love it.

02:05.157 --> 02:08.324
- Wow, here it is! A message from Jim!
- Huh?

02:08.452 --> 02:10.907
"Desperately seeking Susan.
Keep the faith."

02:11.038 --> 02:14.122
"Tuesday 10am. Battery Park,
Gangway one. Love Jim."

02:14.249 --> 02:16.705
- Who's Jim?
- Oh, God, that's tomorrow.

02:16.835 --> 02:18.828
Who's Susan? You know these people?

02:18.962 --> 02:21.714
No. Jim follows Susan
all over the country.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.541
Last January she was in
Mexico City, then Seattle.

02:25.677 --> 02:28.762
They send messages back and forth,
that's how they hook up.

02:28.889 --> 02:30.846
Now they're in New York.

02:30.974 --> 02:34.390
Desperate. I love that word.
It's so romantic.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.355
Everybody I know is
desperate except you.

02:37.481 --> 02:39.520
- I'm desperate.
- You?!

02:40.776 --> 02:42.815
Well... sort of.

03:17.729 --> 03:19.603
<i>You're not shy</i>

03:19.731 --> 03:21.771
<i>You get around</i>

03:21.900 --> 03:23.857
<i>You wanna fly</i>

03:23.986 --> 03:25.943
<i>Don't want your feet on the ground</i>

03:26.071 --> 03:27.945
<i>You stay up</i>

03:28.073 --> 03:29.947
<i>Won't come down</i>

03:30.075 --> 03:32.032
<i>You wanna live</i>

03:32.160 --> 03:34.616
<i>Wanna move to the sound</i>

03:34.746 --> 03:36.324
<i>Got fire</i>

03:36.456 --> 03:38.366
<i>In your veins</i>

03:38.500 --> 03:40.493
<i>Burning hard</i>

03:40.627 --> 03:42.869
<i>Girl, you don't feel the same</i>

03:43.005 --> 03:44.629
<i>Your desires</i>

03:44.756 --> 03:46.714
<i>Are insane</i>

03:46.842 --> 03:48.834
<i>You won't stop</i>

03:48.969 --> 03:51.009
<i>Until you do it again</i>

03:51.930 --> 03:53.306
<i>Sometimes I wonder</i>

03:53.432 --> 03:55.471
<i>As I look in your eyes</i>

03:55.767 --> 03:57.559
<i>Maybe you're thinking</i>

03:57.686 --> 03:59.394
<i>Of some other guy</i>

03:59.521 --> 04:01.561
<i>But I don't ever know...</i>

04:02.357 --> 04:04.397
Room service!

04:04.526 --> 04:06.566
It's open!

04:09.364 --> 04:10.775
Smile.

04:10.908 --> 04:12.236
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:12.367 --> 04:14.740
I got you a newspaper
and your tequila.

04:14.870 --> 04:17.159
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

04:21.793 --> 04:24.331
- Where do you want it?
- That's fine.

04:26.757 --> 04:28.749
Don't spend it all in one place.

04:28.884 --> 04:31.422
I won't. Thanks.

04:52.449 --> 04:54.406
Jimmy!

04:54.535 --> 04:56.574
It's about time!

05:29.945 --> 05:31.984
Nice!

05:49.590 --> 05:51.629
Bye-bye, Bruce.

05:51.758 --> 05:53.798
It was fun, huh?

06:11.236 --> 06:13.395
Hold the elevator!

06:18.744 --> 06:20.783
Wait a second!

06:59.201 --> 07:02.036
Roberta, don't let me eat these.
They're so good!

07:02.162 --> 07:04.202
Hey, I think I've found one.

07:04.331 --> 07:06.787
- One of what?
- Upstairs. Come on.

07:10.254 --> 07:12.542
He's been giving
me the eye all night.

07:12.673 --> 07:14.499
- Who is he?
- Who?

07:14.633 --> 07:17.420
- In the corner, near Gary.
- Larry Stillman.

07:17.553 --> 07:20.008
- Dr Stillman.
- Plastic surgery?

07:20.138 --> 07:22.178
He's Gary's dentist.

07:22.307 --> 07:24.383
Well, at least he's not a PhD.

07:31.108 --> 07:34.274
- Gary, who's your friend?
- You know Becky.

07:34.403 --> 07:36.442
Oh! Larry Stillman...

07:36.572 --> 07:38.860
- My sister Leslie.
- Hi, how you doin'?

07:38.991 --> 07:41.316
So you're a dentist...

07:42.828 --> 07:45.745
Oh! Time out, everybody!

07:45.873 --> 07:47.830
I've got a 10.58 spot.

07:47.958 --> 07:49.832
- Oh, right!
- Great!

07:52.462 --> 07:56.591
Rosemary will have another
instalment of Growing up In Queens.

07:56.717 --> 07:58.756
The search continues for suspects...

07:58.886 --> 08:01.803
in the recent robbery of
ancient Egyptian artefacts.

08:01.930 --> 08:05.465
That and more,
next on the news at 11.

08:06.143 --> 08:09.726
Hi. I'm Gary from Gary's Oasis.

08:09.855 --> 08:13.639
In our New Jersey showroom,
we have hundreds of models...

08:13.775 --> 08:18.272
of whirlpools and hot tubs at the
lowest manufacturer-to-you prices.

08:18.405 --> 08:20.445
So come on out to Gary's Oasis.

08:20.574 --> 08:24.951
- We're open seven days a week.
- Hey, Gary. Come on in!

08:30.834 --> 08:35.876
At Gary's Oasis all your
fantasies can come true!

08:39.009 --> 08:41.049
Very good!

10:47.179 --> 10:49.504
It's gone for ever.

10:49.640 --> 10:53.720
That funny, young,
lost look... I loved.

10:54.478 --> 10:56.517
It won't ever come back.

10:57.564 --> 11:00.234
I killed that when I
told you about Rebecca.

11:00.359 --> 11:03.941
You can watch in the bedroom
with the headphones.

11:04.071 --> 11:06.110
I know.

11:06.823 --> 11:08.199
Gary,...

11:08.325 --> 11:11.326
do you ever remember your dreams?

11:11.453 --> 11:13.493
I dunno, I never thought about it.

11:13.622 --> 11:15.994
They liked the commercial,
don't you think?

11:16.124 --> 11:18.580
Everyone thought you were great.

11:19.878 --> 11:21.622
Oh, you're gonna...

11:21.755 --> 11:24.922
pick up the radio for the car
for me tomorrow, aren't you?

11:25.050 --> 11:26.461
Sure.

11:26.593 --> 11:28.633
Oh, don't forget...

11:28.762 --> 11:34.635
Tell the guy you're my wife because we
put a sauna in the owner's apartment...

11:34.768 --> 11:37.342
and he's giving us
a really great price.

11:37.479 --> 11:39.472
Night, hon.

11:39.606 --> 11:41.682
Hey! Don't eat all that cake!

12:14.641 --> 12:16.385
- Susan!
- Hi.

12:16.518 --> 12:19.140
My God, we all thought you were dead!

12:19.271 --> 12:21.310
No, just in New Jersey.

13:05.234 --> 13:09.183
Let's hear it, ladies and gentlemen,
for lan, the fabulous lan,...

13:09.321 --> 13:11.563
and his lovely assistant Crystal!

13:18.830 --> 13:20.740
Hi.

13:20.874 --> 13:23.828
- Susan! Where have you been?
- All over.

13:23.961 --> 13:26.000
- Anybody I know?
- No.

13:26.129 --> 13:28.169
Some guy from Atlantic City.

13:28.298 --> 13:31.003
It was fun till he
started getting serious.

13:31.134 --> 13:34.669
- How's tricks?
- I'm ready to quit this dump. I really am.

13:34.805 --> 13:36.797
Ray won't let me wear my glasses,...

13:36.932 --> 13:39.719
then lan gets pissed off
when I can't do the tricks.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.891
I mean, I'm only legally blind!

13:42.020 --> 13:44.855
I could understand if I wore
my glasses on my tits,...

13:44.982 --> 13:46.974
but nobody here looks at my face!

13:47.109 --> 13:49.647
Come on, let's just get outta here.

13:49.820 --> 13:52.774
- I have to do the Disappearing Bluebird.
- Sounds great.

13:52.906 --> 13:54.946
- Can't you wait?
- I'm really tired.

13:55.075 --> 13:57.281
I could get some pizza
and meet you at home.

13:57.411 --> 14:00.531
- You've got a place?
- Not exactly.

14:00.664 --> 14:02.704
But I'm working on it.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.581
Oh, no. I know what's coming now.

14:05.711 --> 14:07.750
Just for tonight, I promise.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.919
Come on!

14:11.425 --> 14:14.212
Do you promise only
seven-digit phone calls?

14:14.344 --> 14:16.670
Cross my heart. You won't regret it.

14:18.515 --> 14:20.722
Thanks.

14:20.851 --> 14:22.725
Welcome back.

14:22.853 --> 14:24.762
I'll see you later.

14:51.215 --> 14:53.254
Hey, baby. Take a paper.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.726
Wow, I don't believe it.

15:12.152 --> 15:13.481
Shit!

16:15.424 --> 16:17.333
Excuse me!

16:17.467 --> 16:20.089
- You got a light?
- No, I don't smoke.

16:24.057 --> 16:25.635
Susan!

17:07.099 --> 17:10.018
How come you split without
saying goodbye in person?

17:10.145 --> 17:12.352
Everybody says goodbye in person.

17:13.147 --> 17:15.188
Come on. Let's go get a drink.

17:15.317 --> 17:17.938
Yeah, OK, but I've
only got a few minutes.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.525
- Oh, great...
- It's a last-minute thing.

17:20.656 --> 17:23.740
The band got this gig in
Buffalo and we start tonight.

17:23.867 --> 17:26.192
Next time don't put an
ad in the paper, OK?

17:26.328 --> 17:29.495
Susan, I've been looking
for you for weeks!

17:29.623 --> 17:31.616
Come to Buffalo with me?

17:31.750 --> 17:33.743
You'll be working.

17:33.877 --> 17:36.333
- It's boring.
- Come to Buffalo.

17:36.463 --> 17:39.797
I'll find some trouble
for you to get into.

17:39.925 --> 17:41.964
I've had enough trouble already.

17:45.264 --> 17:47.256
You... you were with this guy?

17:47.391 --> 17:49.348
He was breathing when I left.

17:49.476 --> 17:53.426
Hey! Beauty and the Beast, we'll hit
traffic on the bridge. Let's fly!

17:55.315 --> 17:57.355
I don't like leaving you like this.

17:57.484 --> 18:01.019
- I can take care of myself.
- I know.

18:01.154 --> 18:03.692
Look, I'll give you a number.

18:04.491 --> 18:06.531
You got a pen?

18:08.078 --> 18:11.198
All right, this is the
number of my friend Dez.

18:11.331 --> 18:13.371
He's a great guy...

18:13.500 --> 18:17.368
and if you really get in a jam, call him.
He'll know how to reach me.

18:17.504 --> 18:21.419
- Has he got any money?
- Forget it! He knows all about you.

18:24.428 --> 18:27.512
<i>Here comes Johnny Yen again</i>

18:28.390 --> 18:30.548
<i>With the liquor and drugs</i>

18:30.684 --> 18:32.890
<i>And the flesh machine</i>

18:33.020 --> 18:35.059
No more dead bodies, OK?

18:35.189 --> 18:37.228
I'll see what I can do.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.475
Be here next time when I get back.

18:43.113 --> 18:47.775
<i>And I been hurtin'
since I bought the gimmick...</i>

19:21.735 --> 19:23.775
Come on, baby!

19:23.904 --> 19:26.395
Check it out!

19:30.619 --> 19:34.154
Hey, baby, I got a pair of
sunglasses just for you!

19:36.124 --> 19:38.164
This hat'll look great on you, baby.

19:38.293 --> 19:40.784
Take a look in the mirror.
Beautiful, right?

19:40.921 --> 19:43.044
$10 for the set, all right?
Ten bucks.

19:44.883 --> 19:47.172
You gonna buy?
Hey, where you goin', babe?

19:47.302 --> 19:49.793
Yo! Come back! What are
you doin' with my hat?

19:49.930 --> 19:52.338
Give me my glasses, babe!
What's the matter?

19:52.474 --> 19:54.799
- Oh, man! I don't believe it!
- I'm sorry.

19:54.935 --> 19:56.974
What are you doin'?

19:57.104 --> 19:59.476
- I'm sorry.
- What do you mean, "sorry"? Hey!

19:59.606 --> 20:00.851
Sorry!

20:49.865 --> 20:51.692
<i>I ain't gonna do you wrong</i>

20:52.159 --> 20:54.151
<i>While you're gone</i>

20:54.286 --> 20:56.325
<i>Ain't gonna do you wrong</i>

20:56.914 --> 20:58.408
<i>Cos I don't wanna</i>

20:58.540 --> 21:00.332
<i>All I'm askin'</i>

21:00.459 --> 21:03.413
<i>Is for a little respect
when you come home</i>

21:03.545 --> 21:06.297
<i>Baby, when you get home</i>

21:09.968 --> 21:12.210
<i>I'm about to give you</i>

21:12.638 --> 21:14.879
<i>All of my money</i>

21:15.015 --> 21:17.091
<i>And all I'm askin'...</i>

21:17.226 --> 21:20.013
Do me a favour, baby.
Stay on the carpet, OK?

21:20.145 --> 21:22.683
- They're great, aren't they?
- I know.

21:23.398 --> 21:25.438
I gotta have 'em, but 65 bucks...

21:25.567 --> 21:27.690
- That is the price.
- Forget it.

21:27.819 --> 21:31.603
- I like the jacket.
- It used to belong to Jimi Hendrix.

21:31.740 --> 21:35.323
But I bet he'd love it if I
swapped it for the boots.

21:36.203 --> 21:38.242
Deal.

21:47.089 --> 21:49.295
<i>Ooo, your kiss is</i>

21:49.424 --> 21:50.919
<i>Sweeter than honey</i>

21:52.678 --> 21:53.709
<i>And guess what?</i>

21:53.846 --> 21:56.087
<i>So is my money...</i>

22:08.443 --> 22:10.270
Gorgeous, isn't it?

22:10.404 --> 22:12.443
It used to belong to Elvis Presley.

22:12.573 --> 22:15.242
- Wanna try it on?
- All right.

22:16.159 --> 22:18.485
<i>Oh, a little respect</i>

22:20.372 --> 22:22.530
<i>Oh, hey! A little respect...</i>

22:59.244 --> 23:01.486
We start off with the eggs.

23:02.414 --> 23:04.454
These go very fast done two by two.

23:04.583 --> 23:06.622
And this you can do in the morning...

23:07.544 --> 23:09.833
and get it all ready for baking.

23:09.963 --> 23:12.668
I'm gonna bake it
and then unmould it.

23:13.884 --> 23:15.923
There are your six eggs.

23:18.055 --> 23:22.183
Those get beaten up a little
bit and then in goes...

23:22.309 --> 23:24.266
Hello, Roberta.

23:24.394 --> 23:26.352
Hello, Julia.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.935
Sorry, girls. I can't
stay for dinner.

23:29.066 --> 23:31.853
Some guy from West
Germany's got 1500 tubs...

23:31.985 --> 23:33.978
he can't get through customs.

23:34.112 --> 23:36.152
I gotta go have dinner
with him in town.

23:36.281 --> 23:38.855
It just happened. I'm sorry.
You forgive me?

23:41.036 --> 23:43.076
Looks interesting too.

23:43.956 --> 23:46.873
- Get a good deal on the radio?
- Radio?

23:47.000 --> 23:50.784
- Car radio. You just came from the city.
- Oh, my God, the radio.

23:51.755 --> 23:53.795
- You forgot the radio?
- No!

23:54.508 --> 23:56.547
Yeah, right, I guess I did.

23:56.677 --> 23:59.678
You could have said you didn't
want dinner. I had to rush!

23:59.805 --> 24:01.797
You said you didn't go anywhere.

24:01.932 --> 24:03.723
What are you wearing?

24:04.810 --> 24:08.060
A jacket. It used to
belong to Jimi Hendrix.

24:09.648 --> 24:11.973
You bought a used jacket?
What, are we poor?

24:12.109 --> 24:14.148
What's going on here?

24:20.117 --> 24:22.489
Roberta, I gotta run! I'm late.

24:22.619 --> 24:24.778
We'll talk later, all right?

24:24.913 --> 24:27.120
All right, we'll talk later?

24:31.170 --> 24:33.209
Jimi Hendrix, huh?

25:26.058 --> 25:28.097
You sold it?

25:29.061 --> 25:32.430
I had a key that was important.
I got my shit inside a locker.

25:32.564 --> 25:36.099
- I sold it!
- I'll leave you my name and number.

26:03.428 --> 26:05.468
Good goin', stranger.

26:06.598 --> 26:08.638
Well, what fuckin' stranger?!

26:08.767 --> 26:11.638
Festival seating.
That means Portosans.

26:11.770 --> 26:16.099
Portosans means pissing with flies.
I'm not gonna piss with flies.

26:16.233 --> 26:19.768
You guys can piss in bottles.
What the hell is this? Woodstock?

26:43.427 --> 26:45.669
- Projection.
- Dez, it's me. Jim.

26:45.804 --> 26:47.631
Hold on a second.

26:50.601 --> 26:52.640
Jesus Christ!

26:52.769 --> 26:56.719
I'm stuck in Buffalo and I need
a favour. It's about Susan.

26:56.857 --> 27:02.646
See, now some guy she met in Atlantic
City got pushed out of a hotel window.

27:02.779 --> 27:05.021
This sounds wild.
I'm sorry I missed it.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.196
This is serious, Dez.

27:07.326 --> 27:11.738
And now some guy's run an ad to meet
her in Battery Park, signed "a stranger".

27:11.872 --> 27:16.000
It sounds weird.
Could you just go down there...

27:16.126 --> 27:18.000
and make sure she's OK?

27:18.128 --> 27:22.126
Jim, Victoria split on me last night.
I'm in a shitty mood.

27:22.257 --> 27:25.128
I'm not in the mood for being
a boy scout right now.

27:25.260 --> 27:27.502
Come on, Dez.
It'll take you half an hour.

27:27.638 --> 27:31.220
- Come on!
- Give me a chance here. One second.

27:33.060 --> 27:36.760
- She's got to meet him at 4 o'clock.
- That's in less than an hour!

27:36.897 --> 27:39.103
Jim, I got a job here, you know!

27:39.233 --> 27:41.272
This one favour.

27:41.401 --> 27:43.857
Even if I could get someone
to fill in for me...

27:43.987 --> 27:46.146
I don't even know
what she looks like.

27:46.281 --> 27:48.321
Look, you can't miss her.

27:48.450 --> 27:52.033
She's incredibly pretty,
blonde hair... medium height.

27:52.162 --> 27:54.534
And she's got this green
and gold jacket...

27:54.665 --> 27:58.912
with a pyramid with an eye on top
like a dollar bill. You can't miss it.

27:59.044 --> 28:03.291
- All right, you owe me one.
- Great. Thanks, Dez, I appreciate it.

28:03.423 --> 28:05.463
OK, yeah. Bye.

28:06.677 --> 28:08.716
I lived in New York all my life.

28:08.846 --> 28:12.012
We used to have Chinese restaurants,
Italian restaurants.

28:12.140 --> 28:15.509
Now you have these sushi restaurants.
Everyone goes for sushi.

28:15.644 --> 28:17.684
Sushi... I hate the stuff.

28:17.813 --> 28:20.565
Although, I tell you,
I had some the other day.

28:20.691 --> 28:24.439
I took it home, I cooked it,
it wasn't bad. It tasted like fish.

28:51.388 --> 28:53.428
$9.20.

28:55.726 --> 28:57.765
Here, keep the change.

28:57.895 --> 29:01.061
Whoa! Hey! What is that? Hey, lady!

29:01.190 --> 29:03.229
Hey! Hey, lady!

29:03.358 --> 29:05.316
What is this?

29:05.444 --> 29:07.353
Oh, that's cute!

29:12.075 --> 29:14.115
Hi.

29:16.163 --> 29:18.784
You look like I've seen
you somewhere before.

29:18.916 --> 29:21.786
- No, I don't think so.
- Yeah, I think so.

29:24.296 --> 29:28.045
- You doin' anything right now?
- I'm waiting for someone.

29:38.769 --> 29:41.972
- Come with me, miss.
- I have to meet someone.

29:42.105 --> 29:45.059
- We'll talk about it in the car.
- She's got all my stuff.

29:45.192 --> 29:47.944
She'll give you the goddamn cab fare!

29:49.279 --> 29:52.980
I don't need this aggravation.
I work for a living.

29:53.116 --> 29:55.156
Theft of services. I know the law.

29:56.411 --> 29:59.946
Well, hi! Excuse me,
but do you like candy?

30:00.082 --> 30:02.833
- I got some Sugar Babies.
- No, thank you.

30:02.960 --> 30:07.586
I wanted to have a chat. I was very
close to your boyfriend in Atlantic City.

30:07.714 --> 30:11.712
- No, no, no. I'm married.
- No, I don't think so!

30:17.432 --> 30:18.843
Susan!

30:18.976 --> 30:21.301
Did you wear the pretty
earrings he gave you?

30:21.436 --> 30:25.137
- Let's have a chat. My car is over there.
- Let go of me!

30:25.274 --> 30:28.061
- Susan!
- Let go!

30:29.393 --> 30:31.401
Susan!

30:44.001 --> 30:46.040
Susan?

30:47.337 --> 30:49.377
Susan?

30:51.717 --> 30:53.793
- What happened?
- Are you OK?

30:54.720 --> 30:56.759
My head hurts.

30:56.889 --> 30:59.047
I'm Dez. I'm a friend of Jim's.

31:00.142 --> 31:02.181
Jim?

31:02.311 --> 31:06.011
Your boyfriend Jim.
Who was the guy hassling you?

31:08.233 --> 31:10.558
- Guy?
- The guy that just ran off.

31:13.739 --> 31:15.778
- I dunno.
- You don't know?

31:17.451 --> 31:20.321
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

31:21.413 --> 31:23.453
Are you OK?

31:23.582 --> 31:25.621
Do you wanna see a doctor?

31:26.668 --> 31:28.957
- I'm OK.
- You're OK.

31:30.964 --> 31:33.004
She's OK. Show's over.

31:33.133 --> 31:35.256
She's with me, she's OK.

31:36.887 --> 31:38.926
Sit down?

31:40.641 --> 31:42.680
Do you remember anything?

31:42.809 --> 31:44.849
I don't know.

31:44.978 --> 31:47.018
How did you get here?

31:47.147 --> 31:48.974
I don't know.

31:50.609 --> 31:53.776
Do you remember what
you had for breakfast?

31:54.780 --> 31:56.440
I don't know.

31:57.199 --> 31:59.238
You are Susan, aren't you?

32:00.285 --> 32:02.955
- Susan?
- You don't know.

32:04.998 --> 32:07.038
All right, what do we have here?

32:07.167 --> 32:08.792
No purse?

32:08.919 --> 32:12.003
Do you have anything in
your pockets, maybe?

32:20.514 --> 32:22.553
Is that it?

32:23.308 --> 32:25.597
Now we're getting someplace.

32:25.727 --> 32:27.601
This is my phone number.

32:27.729 --> 32:29.687
Jim must have given it to you.

32:30.566 --> 32:32.605
This is like a déjà vu.

32:33.652 --> 32:36.736
How can you have a déjà vu if
you don't remember anything?

32:36.864 --> 32:39.948
No, no. I mean...
this is all déjà vu.

32:43.203 --> 32:45.694
This is a Port Authority locker key.

32:45.831 --> 32:49.164
I tell you what. I'm gonna run
you up to the Port Authority.

32:49.293 --> 32:53.160
Maybe what's ever in the locker will
help you snap out of it. How's that?

32:53.297 --> 32:55.585
- OK.
- OK.

32:57.009 --> 32:59.048
Let's go.

33:01.805 --> 33:03.762
Wait a minute.

33:03.891 --> 33:06.512
This isn't some sort of trick, is it?

33:06.643 --> 33:10.855
- What do you mean?
- I mean I know a little bit about you, OK?

33:10.981 --> 33:16.437
So don't even consider jerking me around
because I'm not in a great mood today.

33:16.570 --> 33:18.609
Sure, I mean, I wouldn't...

33:18.739 --> 33:20.778
jerk you around.

33:20.908 --> 33:22.947
I don't even know you.

33:25.913 --> 33:27.952
You better wear this.

33:58.695 --> 34:01.483
I hope it's filled
with something good.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.618
Look at this!

34:16.839 --> 34:19.080
You sure do move around a lot, huh?

34:19.216 --> 34:21.255
Yeah, I guess.

34:39.277 --> 34:42.444
So this stuff does
look familiar, right?

34:42.572 --> 34:44.731
Well, it's not completely unfamiliar.

34:46.577 --> 34:49.909
You know, when I close
my eyes I see a pyramid.

34:50.038 --> 34:52.280
A pyramid?

34:52.416 --> 34:54.741
Like on your jacket?

34:56.837 --> 34:59.838
Oh, yeah. That must be what it is.

34:59.965 --> 35:03.299
At least you got everything.
I hope you're feeling better.

35:03.427 --> 35:05.466
- You are feeling better?
- Yeah.

35:05.596 --> 35:09.178
Good. I gotta go.
I gotta get that scooter back.

35:09.308 --> 35:12.225
So... I'll see you around
maybe sometime, huh?

35:12.352 --> 35:15.057
Maybe... I'll see you with Jim.

35:15.189 --> 35:18.059
OK? All right, take care! Bye.

35:18.192 --> 35:20.231
Bye.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.346
Susan!

35:48.472 --> 35:51.177
Have you got a place
to sleep tonight?

35:59.233 --> 36:01.272
You can sleep at my place.

36:01.401 --> 36:03.441
One night... on the couch.

36:03.570 --> 36:05.610
But I don't want any drama.

36:05.739 --> 36:07.779
I don't want your
friends coming over.

36:07.908 --> 36:12.653
And I want nothing disappearing
from my apartment. You got that?

36:23.298 --> 36:25.338
Maybe you should quit?

36:26.552 --> 36:28.046
Maybe.

36:35.352 --> 36:38.686
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

36:42.192 --> 36:44.232
OK, you. You're outta here.

36:46.196 --> 36:48.236
It's about time.

37:16.685 --> 37:19.057
I don't believe it.

37:45.464 --> 37:48.002
Sorry, man. Have you been waiting?

37:52.513 --> 37:55.597
- Never ever again!
- Listen, man, it was an emergency.

37:55.724 --> 37:58.429
I understand. Never ever.
Don't ever ask me again.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.600
- OK.
- Sorry.

38:02.147 --> 38:04.187
This way.

38:13.033 --> 38:16.449
- People live here?
- Yes, people live here!

38:16.578 --> 38:20.161
I just thought it was sort
of unusual, that's all.

38:21.708 --> 38:23.997
Two flights up.

38:30.467 --> 38:32.507
Oh! Sorry.

38:38.433 --> 38:41.138
Oh! Sorry, man. Excuse me.

38:43.230 --> 38:45.935
Those look exactly like my speakers.

38:59.872 --> 39:02.197
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute.

39:02.332 --> 39:04.740
What do you think you're doing?
Give me that.

39:04.877 --> 39:06.916
Thank you.

39:08.630 --> 39:10.789
What the hell is goin' on here?

39:23.812 --> 39:25.852
I don't believe it.

39:29.443 --> 39:31.519
What you've gotta do is...

39:31.653 --> 39:34.061
That's just great, Victoria.

39:34.781 --> 39:36.821
It's my stuff, Dez.

39:36.950 --> 39:38.990
So you just come and take it.

39:39.119 --> 39:42.155
No phone call, no discussion,
no nothing.

39:43.248 --> 39:45.704
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine.

39:47.836 --> 39:51.252
Listen... I'm gonna take
this stuff down to the Porsche.

39:51.381 --> 39:53.872
I believe some of that stuff is mine.

39:54.009 --> 39:57.425
Like the answering machine.
Like the Charlie Parker records.

39:57.554 --> 40:00.425
- Oh, you can have it. Here.
- Thank you.

40:04.353 --> 40:06.595
I'll send you a cheque
for the rest, OK?

40:06.730 --> 40:09.268
A cheque? Great.

40:14.446 --> 40:16.486
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.654
He's really a nice guy.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.823
You'll be happy together.

40:29.753 --> 40:32.540
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

40:34.716 --> 40:38.132
You know... you could do
a lot with this place.

40:38.262 --> 40:40.301
There's a lot of light.

40:45.811 --> 40:47.850
Shit.

40:49.147 --> 40:51.187
It happens, right?

40:54.361 --> 40:57.481
Oh, hi, Dez. It's... It's Jim here.

40:57.614 --> 40:59.773
I'm just calling to
see if Susan's OK.

40:59.908 --> 41:03.609
I'm calling from... Oh, shit,
I don't know where we are.

41:03.745 --> 41:06.450
It's some motel... Hey, where are we?

41:06.582 --> 41:09.832
Anyway, no, look...
I'll call you tomorrow, OK?

41:09.960 --> 41:11.953
And thanks again for everything.

41:12.087 --> 41:14.495
You're a pal. Thanks a lot. OK, bye.

41:16.258 --> 41:18.297
That's gotta ring some bells.

41:19.094 --> 41:22.428
- Honestly, no.
- No?

41:22.556 --> 41:24.595
Terrific.

41:24.725 --> 41:27.726
- I need a drink. Do you want something?
- All right.

41:27.853 --> 41:30.807
Whatever you're having.
Apple juice. Coke. Perrier.

41:30.939 --> 41:32.979
Miller or a Heineken?

41:33.108 --> 41:35.564
- All right.
- Which?

41:35.694 --> 41:37.354
Either one.

41:37.487 --> 41:39.065
Please.

41:48.582 --> 41:50.990
I don't believe it!

42:01.136 --> 42:03.176
She took the refrigerator.

42:06.808 --> 42:10.972
- What did the police say?
- Most of these cases turn up in 24 hours.

42:11.104 --> 42:14.723
Did you tell them about the jacket?
Her wedding ring in the soap dish?

42:14.858 --> 42:16.685
I told them!

42:17.528 --> 42:20.363
They seem to think
she's having an affair.

42:20.489 --> 42:23.158
Oh, my God, maybe she is!

42:23.283 --> 42:26.201
It's ridiculous.
Roberta is not having an affair!

42:26.328 --> 42:29.911
- She's much too uptight.
- That is a horrible thing to say.

42:30.040 --> 42:34.120
I suppose you're proud of the way you're
running around with Becky Shuman.

42:34.253 --> 42:37.704
I didn't know you knew.
Anyway, we're not running around!

42:37.840 --> 42:41.043
We're having a perfectly
respectable affair!

42:41.176 --> 42:43.548
- Gary, let me ask you something.
- What?

42:43.679 --> 42:48.175
Does Roberta have orgasms?
I mean, did she have them with you?

42:49.268 --> 42:52.055
- Orgasms?
- You have heard of them, haven't you?

42:52.187 --> 42:55.224
Maybe she left you because
you weren't satisfying her.

42:55.357 --> 42:58.808
Leslie! Not everybody is
obsessed with orgasms!

42:58.944 --> 43:01.400
- Some people just... have them.
- Did she?

43:01.530 --> 43:05.575
- Did Phil Donahue discuss orgasms?!
- You are really a pig!

43:05.701 --> 43:08.867
- At least I know about feelings.
- Feelings. I feel! I feel!

43:08.996 --> 43:12.945
You're disgusting. You're just like Daddy!
No wonder Roberta left you.

43:13.083 --> 43:15.123
Would you stop saying that!

43:15.252 --> 43:17.291
- Gary...
- Larry!

43:17.421 --> 43:20.090
That looks great.
Any word from Roberta yet?

43:20.215 --> 43:21.923
Fast work, Les.

43:22.050 --> 43:24.090
Oh, let's have some chicken.

43:24.219 --> 43:26.259
The chicken is for tomorrow. Larry!

43:26.388 --> 43:28.297
What did the police say?

43:28.432 --> 43:31.101
I can't believe you're
eating during a crisis!

43:31.226 --> 43:32.637
We're nervous!

43:32.769 --> 43:35.557
Then take a Valium
like a normal person!

43:40.777 --> 43:42.817
She has great teeth.

43:43.697 --> 43:46.947
That's why I showed
up at Battery Park.

43:47.993 --> 43:52.287
Jim said a friend of yours got killed
outside your hotel in Atlantic City.

43:52.414 --> 43:54.454
He was pretty worried.

43:54.583 --> 43:56.622
Killed?

43:56.752 --> 43:58.626
Dead?

43:58.754 --> 44:02.337
Sort of goes with the territory,
doesn't it, Susan?

44:04.801 --> 44:06.841
Maybe I know who did it.

44:08.514 --> 44:10.553
I wish I could remember.

44:12.768 --> 44:14.807
Maybe you were the killer.

44:15.646 --> 44:17.385
No!

44:23.028 --> 44:25.982
I should probably lay
low for while, huh?

44:26.573 --> 44:28.613
It might be a wise idea.

44:30.410 --> 44:33.364
You don't know who the
guy at the quay was?

44:35.916 --> 44:37.955
Maybe a jilted lover?

44:41.672 --> 44:43.711
I don't think so.

44:46.552 --> 44:48.591
Maybe he was.

44:49.471 --> 44:51.594
You know somethin'?

44:51.723 --> 44:54.345
You are not at all what I expected.

44:55.894 --> 44:58.432
You're not quite what
I expected either.

45:19.877 --> 45:22.913
Just how did I meet Jim?
I mean, how...

45:23.672 --> 45:25.712
How did I meet him?

45:25.841 --> 45:27.880
Maybe it would help.

45:28.010 --> 45:30.465
I think it was at some coffee shop.

45:31.763 --> 45:33.803
It was your first day at work.

45:33.932 --> 45:35.972
Jim waltzed in.

45:36.101 --> 45:39.185
You brought his food over and
you ripped up the check.

45:40.898 --> 45:44.183
Is he tall? I mean Jim.

45:45.194 --> 45:47.435
He's about medium.

45:48.947 --> 45:50.987
Is he sort of thin?

45:52.409 --> 45:54.449
Sort of. Sort of...

45:55.370 --> 45:57.363
my build.

46:01.043 --> 46:03.166
What colour eyes does he have?

46:07.382 --> 46:09.292
Blue.

46:09.426 --> 46:11.466
Like yours?

46:18.352 --> 46:20.344
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46:20.479 --> 46:22.518
Sorry.

46:23.899 --> 46:26.604
I don't know what happened. I just...

46:27.402 --> 46:28.897
Sorry.

47:44.980 --> 47:47.020
Come on.

48:09.254 --> 48:11.294
Dez!

48:12.132 --> 48:14.172
Dez...

48:19.681 --> 48:21.721
Wanna go out to breakfast with me?

48:22.684 --> 48:24.724
Breakfast?

48:26.939 --> 48:29.856
What have you got on?
Some sort of disguise?

48:29.983 --> 48:33.233
- You don't like it?
- No, it's...

48:33.362 --> 48:36.149
sort of charming.

48:37.491 --> 48:39.234
It's my treat.

48:40.410 --> 48:42.450
What did you do? Rob a bank?

48:42.579 --> 48:45.497
I don't know. Maybe.

48:47.251 --> 48:49.124
Where do you wanna go?

48:49.253 --> 48:51.494
See, I found this in the suitcase.

48:53.090 --> 48:55.129
Gunny's Coffee Shop?
I know the place.

48:55.259 --> 48:57.298
It's over on Center Street.

48:57.427 --> 49:00.215
Maybe that's the place
where I met Jim.

49:00.806 --> 49:02.134
- So?
- So...

49:02.266 --> 49:06.678
So we go there and see
if anybody remembers me.

49:06.812 --> 49:10.062
So what do you think?
Anyone look familiar?

49:11.525 --> 49:13.767
No. Not yet.

49:22.536 --> 49:25.371
I found this in the suitcase.
You ever hear of it?

49:25.497 --> 49:29.032
The Magic Club? Yeah.
That's that place over on Broadway.

49:29.168 --> 49:30.496
Why?

49:30.627 --> 49:33.332
I thought I'd go there and
see if I remember anyone.

49:33.463 --> 49:36.168
- You know what you're having?
- Sure.

49:36.300 --> 49:38.339
What are you having?

49:38.468 --> 49:40.508
Well, it's your treat, right?

49:41.137 --> 49:44.840
- Yeah, I got money.
- I'm gonna have... blueberry blintzes.

49:44.975 --> 49:47.015
I'll have that too. That sounds good.

49:47.144 --> 49:49.183
What can I get you?

49:49.313 --> 49:51.685
Yes, I would like a... coffee...

49:52.441 --> 49:54.813
and a... doughnut.

49:54.943 --> 49:59.190
Miss! When you get a chance,
could you take our order?

49:59.323 --> 50:01.280
You can stay. She's gotta go.

50:01.408 --> 50:03.946
Mick, it's that crazy
girl with the jacket.

50:04.077 --> 50:06.117
- You, out!
- You know me?!

50:06.246 --> 50:08.369
Yeah. You won't get a free meal here.

50:08.498 --> 50:11.867
- I got money, I can pay.
- I don't want your money. Get out.

50:12.002 --> 50:14.707
- We got money. What is it?
- Mind your own business.

50:14.838 --> 50:17.590
- This is my business, wait a minute!
- Come on, out!

50:17.716 --> 50:20.421
- Hey, I'm with her.
- Come on, come on.

50:21.929 --> 50:24.301
You're lucky I don't press charges!

50:24.431 --> 50:26.056
Dez.

50:26.183 --> 50:28.756
Are you OK? Are you all right?
I'm sorry!

50:28.894 --> 50:30.970
Rule number one was no drama.

50:31.104 --> 50:34.271
- Remember?
- Yes. I know. I'm sorry.

50:35.776 --> 50:37.567
Let's get out of here.

50:37.694 --> 50:39.272
I'm sorry.

50:55.671 --> 50:58.707
You won't even let
me wear my glasses!

50:58.841 --> 51:02.256
Go back to selling T-shirts!
You're fired!

51:02.386 --> 51:05.552
No, you don't, lan, because I quit!

51:07.683 --> 51:10.221
Hey! Not under the ladder!

51:12.813 --> 51:16.941
My luck can't get much worse anyway.
Miserable scumbags!

51:17.693 --> 51:20.148
Maybe I should've slept with him.

51:20.279 --> 51:23.066
Man, some witch steals my clothes,...

51:23.198 --> 51:27.445
Meeker gets pushed out a hotel
window and now you get fired.

51:27.578 --> 51:31.871
No offence, but bad luck really
seems to be following you around.

51:34.543 --> 51:37.876
We're both free now.
Let's just go to the movies.

51:38.005 --> 51:40.044
A double feature?

51:40.174 --> 51:42.213
Come on!

51:44.219 --> 51:46.971
I'll pay for the movie if
you pay for the popcorn.

51:47.097 --> 51:48.675
OK, but listen. How much is popcorn?

51:48.807 --> 51:50.847
- 2.50
- OK.

52:02.946 --> 52:04.986
This must be the place.

52:05.115 --> 52:08.033
Sir, could you pull over,
please? This is it.

52:09.578 --> 52:11.617
I'm sorry about what happened.

52:12.414 --> 52:14.870
- Are you sure you're not angry?
- Yeah.

52:15.709 --> 52:17.749
- Really?
- I'm not angry.

52:18.545 --> 52:20.585
OK. You're a real pal.

52:22.007 --> 52:24.047
I'll tell Jim.

52:24.843 --> 52:26.752
- Bye!
- Bye.

52:33.977 --> 52:36.017
A real pal. I'll tell Jim...

52:38.732 --> 52:40.890
Bleecker Street Cinema.

52:51.036 --> 52:53.492
You just don't fire
someone like that!

52:53.622 --> 52:55.698
Who am I gonna find
at such short notice?

52:55.832 --> 52:57.872
Come on, Ray. You know lots of girls.

52:58.001 --> 53:01.916
- Plenty of women need work.
- Ma! Let me take care of this.

53:02.047 --> 53:03.126
Hello.

53:03.257 --> 53:05.130
You saw the sign outside?

53:05.259 --> 53:07.168
Are you looking for a job?

53:08.971 --> 53:11.047
Yeah. Yeah, I think I am.

53:11.181 --> 53:13.340
- She thinks she's looking for a job.
- No!

53:13.475 --> 53:16.097
I am, I am! What kind of job?

53:16.228 --> 53:18.351
Come on in.

53:18.480 --> 53:20.520
This is Ray.

53:20.649 --> 53:22.689
- Hello.
- This is Ray's mom, Gilda.

53:22.818 --> 53:23.932
Hi.

53:24.069 --> 53:25.694
- This is Henry.
- Hi.

53:25.821 --> 53:27.196
Hello, Henry.

53:27.322 --> 53:29.362
And I'm lan.

53:44.423 --> 53:46.462
Are you OK, Mr Glass?

53:46.592 --> 53:48.964
Fine, thank you. Good night, Daisy.

53:49.094 --> 53:51.419
I hope you get good
news about Mrs Glass.

53:51.555 --> 53:52.551
Thank you.

53:53.140 --> 53:55.132
Where did you get this bag?

53:55.267 --> 53:57.306
It's mine. Mrs Glass give it to me.

53:57.436 --> 53:59.475
Give me the bag, Daisy.

54:00.272 --> 54:03.522
- Daisy, give me the bag!
- Sorry, you ain't getting this bag.

54:03.650 --> 54:06.817
- Please, I'm asking you nicely.
- You're not getting this.

54:19.333 --> 54:23.580
Hey, guys. Could you...
have your picnic somewhere else?

54:31.762 --> 54:33.801
Hey, guys!

54:35.474 --> 54:36.849
Right...

54:36.975 --> 54:39.431
Just try to be careful, all right?

54:42.773 --> 54:46.023
Listen, I don't get involved
in domestic disputes, OK?

54:46.151 --> 54:47.978
There's no dispute.

54:48.111 --> 54:50.437
She had the jacket on
when she disappeared.

54:50.572 --> 54:53.609
It was very special to
her for some reason.

54:53.742 --> 54:55.818
Don't you even remember her?

54:55.953 --> 54:57.992
Don't you remember the jacket?

54:58.121 --> 55:02.783
It was black and gold and it had
a sort of a pyramid thing on it...

55:02.918 --> 55:04.661
like on a dollar bill.

55:04.795 --> 55:06.834
Vaguely.

55:06.964 --> 55:10.130
Great. Thanks.
You've been a terrific help.

55:10.259 --> 55:12.335
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

55:13.095 --> 55:16.096
She stopped in here
looking for the jacket, too.

55:16.223 --> 55:18.262
Maybe you can help each other.

55:20.561 --> 55:22.600
Susan, will you get the phone?

55:24.773 --> 55:26.849
Susan! The phone's ringing!

55:28.902 --> 55:30.942
Susan!

55:39.830 --> 55:41.869
Hello?

55:42.040 --> 55:44.366
Yeah, hold on. She's right here.

55:47.254 --> 55:50.587
- What?
- Another one of your secret admirers.

55:50.716 --> 55:52.755
Hello?

55:53.260 --> 55:55.299
Yeah. Who is this?

55:57.055 --> 55:58.680
Gary Glass?

56:02.186 --> 56:04.225
Huh.

56:04.354 --> 56:07.854
Oh, so you're the witch's husband.
Where's my stuff?

56:09.318 --> 56:11.144
Yeah.

56:11.653 --> 56:13.480
Yeah.

56:13.614 --> 56:15.653
Well, maybe I could help you.

56:16.325 --> 56:21.402
Listen, meet me tonight at
10.30 at 30, West 21st Street.

56:21.538 --> 56:25.156
I'll be waiting on the third floor
near the bar. You got that?

56:25.292 --> 56:27.748
All right, I'll see you there.

56:31.006 --> 56:32.046
Hey!

56:33.842 --> 56:36.049
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

56:36.178 --> 56:39.761
Welcome to the Magic Club.
I'm your host, Big Ray.

56:39.890 --> 56:44.766
We have a wonderful line-up for you
this evening, for all you people.

56:44.895 --> 56:47.468
You, sir, the man in the red shirt...

56:47.606 --> 56:50.097
- Where you from?
- I'm from Brooklyn!

56:50.234 --> 56:52.475
Do we have anyone else
here from Brooklyn?

56:52.611 --> 56:55.783
Right here. Why don't you
two share a cab home?

56:56.613 --> 56:58.499
This is a great audience.

56:58.534 --> 57:02.401
OK, let's get on with it.
Introducing, back from his...

57:02.538 --> 57:04.577
Susan! Come here!

57:04.706 --> 57:07.032
The one, the only, the innovator...

57:07.167 --> 57:10.287
From now on, I want you here
five minutes before we begin.

57:10.420 --> 57:14.465
Remember, we start with the doves.
You look beautiful. Smile.

57:14.591 --> 57:17.509
Davina... Queen of the Night!

57:17.636 --> 57:20.590
So let's hear it from all
you lovely people. Come on!

57:52.754 --> 57:55.080
Menthol, extra-long, ultra-thin!

57:55.215 --> 57:57.837
Extra-ultra long and thin!
Regular, unleaded...

58:08.437 --> 58:09.516
Please!

58:09.646 --> 58:11.972
Come down!

58:28.916 --> 58:30.992
Davina!

59:21.802 --> 59:23.841
Bow!

59:27.266 --> 59:29.887
This one's worse than the other one!

59:31.854 --> 59:33.893
Nice try, kid.

59:34.022 --> 59:36.692
Here you go. 20 bucks.

59:36.817 --> 59:38.975
See you tomorrow night
at the same time.

59:39.111 --> 59:41.483
- You're hiring me?
- Well, of course we are!

59:41.613 --> 59:42.692
Thank you!

59:42.823 --> 59:45.943
Take these guys home
and practise, all right?

59:46.076 --> 59:49.860
And, Susan... practise a lot! OK?

59:49.997 --> 59:51.823
- All right.
- Good.

01:00:12.853 --> 01:00:15.059
<i>Get into the groove</i>

01:00:15.189 --> 01:00:16.766
<i>Boy, you've got to prove</i>

01:00:16.899 --> 01:00:21.276
<i>Your love to me, yeah</i>

01:00:21.403 --> 01:00:23.063
<i>Get up on your feet</i>

01:00:23.197 --> 01:00:25.106
<i>Yeah, step to the beat</i>

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:28.574
<i>Boy, what will it be?</i>

01:00:29.286 --> 01:00:32.987
<i>Music can be such a revelation</i>

01:00:33.165 --> 01:00:34.327
<i>Dancing around</i>

01:00:34.458 --> 01:00:37.624
<i>You feel the sweet sensation</i>

01:00:37.753 --> 01:00:41.453
<i>We might be lovers
if the rhythm's right</i>

01:00:41.715 --> 01:00:45.795
<i>I hope this feeling
never ends tonight</i>

01:00:45.928 --> 01:00:50.091
<i>Only when I'm dancing
can I feel this free</i>

01:00:50.557 --> 01:00:54.306
<i>At night I lock the doors
where no one else can see</i>

01:00:54.436 --> 01:00:58.054
<i>I'm tired of dancing
here all by myself</i>

01:00:58.607 --> 01:01:02.521
<i>Tonight I wanna dance
with someone else</i>

01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:04.564
<i>Get into the groove</i>

01:01:04.696 --> 01:01:06.736
<i>Boy, you've got to prove</i>

01:01:06.949 --> 01:01:10.993
<i>Your love to me, yeah</i>

01:01:11.119 --> 01:01:13.029
<i>Get up on your feet</i>

01:01:13.163 --> 01:01:15.120
<i>Yeah, step to the beat</i>

01:01:15.249 --> 01:01:18.333
<i>Boy, what will it be?</i>

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:21.378
<i>Gonna get to know you
in a special way...</i>

01:01:21.505 --> 01:01:23.497
Gary Glass, right?

01:01:23.632 --> 01:01:25.541
Yeah, how did you know?

01:01:25.676 --> 01:01:27.715
Wild guess.

01:01:29.471 --> 01:01:32.970
- She split on you, huh?
- Yeah. Two days ago.

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:35.139
Has she ever split on you before?

01:01:35.269 --> 01:01:37.095
No, of course not.

01:01:37.271 --> 01:01:40.355
- Did she do drugs?
- Drugs? Roberta?

01:01:40.941 --> 01:01:43.397
She's never smoked a
joint in her whole life.

01:01:43.527 --> 01:01:47.275
She's probably the straightest
person in Fort Lee.

01:01:47.406 --> 01:01:49.445
What are you driving at?

01:01:50.325 --> 01:01:54.026
- Do you want something to drink?
- No, thanks.

01:01:54.162 --> 01:01:58.030
I'm on this health programme, you know?
No alcohol, no sugar...

01:01:58.166 --> 01:02:00.243
- Do you wanna dance?
- Dance?

01:02:06.383 --> 01:02:09.503
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:02:09.636 --> 01:02:11.962
<i>Live out your fantasy</i>

01:02:12.097 --> 01:02:14.006
<i>Here with me</i>

01:02:14.141 --> 01:02:17.510
<i>Just let the music set you free</i>

01:02:17.644 --> 01:02:20.978
Did you read that stuff in the
newspaper about that guy Meeker?

01:02:21.106 --> 01:02:23.858
He got pushed out of a hotel
window in Atlantic City.

01:02:23.984 --> 01:02:26.771
- No, why?
- Roberta's mixed up in it.

01:02:26.904 --> 01:02:28.943
Roberta? That's impossible!

01:02:29.072 --> 01:02:32.691
Fact. She's trying to frame
me for Meeker's murder.

01:02:32.826 --> 01:02:34.866
Who's Meeker?

01:02:37.247 --> 01:02:39.999
Who's Meeker and what does
he have to do with Roberta?

01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:43.541
Ex-partner and Roberta
were in on it together.

01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:45.710
I-I think you're mistaken.

01:02:45.839 --> 01:02:49.374
Roberta doesn't know
anybody in Atlantic City.

01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:51.549
I've seen them together!

01:02:51.678 --> 01:02:55.178
You saw Roberta with
another man! Who?

01:02:55.891 --> 01:02:58.429
Looks like a real greaseball to me.

01:02:59.937 --> 01:03:01.976
I don't believe a word you're saying.

01:03:02.105 --> 01:03:04.513
Here, trust me.
You wanna find your wife?

01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:07.983
- Yeah, of course I do!
- Good. Let's go to your place.

01:03:08.111 --> 01:03:10.151
My place?

01:03:10.656 --> 01:03:12.613
Excuse me.

01:03:12.741 --> 01:03:16.406
<i>Now I know you're mine</i>

01:04:58.722 --> 01:05:00.216
Excuse me!

01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:02.591
Sir!

01:05:02.726 --> 01:05:04.766
There's someone following me.

01:05:05.521 --> 01:05:07.560
Please! Could you... Could you...

01:05:07.689 --> 01:05:10.145
There's a man...
There's a man following me...

01:05:10.275 --> 01:05:13.312
How do you get in here?
You're not supposed to be in here.

01:05:13.445 --> 01:05:16.779
I know. I'm sorry, sir, but could
you please see if he's gone?

01:05:16.907 --> 01:05:19.908
There's a man following me.
Could you see if he's gone?

01:05:20.035 --> 01:05:22.075
- OK.
- Thank you.

01:05:24.122 --> 01:05:26.162
You stay here.

01:05:26.291 --> 01:05:28.961
Enrique will take care of it.

01:05:31.588 --> 01:05:33.380
¡No mal!

01:05:33.507 --> 01:05:35.546
Yeah.

01:05:36.802 --> 01:05:38.794
¡Coño!

01:05:42.224 --> 01:05:44.051
<i>He's hot!</i>

01:05:48.021 --> 01:05:49.350
<i>Your body's hot</i>

01:05:49.481 --> 01:05:52.435
<i>You're always hot,
all the time, hot...</i>

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.107
<i>Oh, I'm so hot, oh!</i>

01:05:58.699 --> 01:06:00.407
<i>So hot!</i>

01:06:01.451 --> 01:06:04.702
¡Hola! Soy Gary de Gary's Oasis.

01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:06.704
En nuestro local en New Jersey,...

01:06:06.832 --> 01:06:09.916
tenemos cientos de bañeras
calientes a los precios más bajos.

01:06:10.043 --> 01:06:12.001
Así que venga a Gary's Oasis,...

01:06:12.129 --> 01:06:14.168
abierto siete días a la semana.

01:06:14.298 --> 01:06:16.753
- ¡Hola, Gary!
- No, muchachas. ¡No!

01:06:18.218 --> 01:06:22.086
At Gary's Oasis all your
fantasies can come true!

01:06:25.434 --> 01:06:27.473
Sir?

01:06:29.646 --> 01:06:31.686
Sir!

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.786
Taxi! Taxi!

01:06:50.626 --> 01:06:52.665
Taxi!

01:07:13.148 --> 01:07:16.232
- You'll get yourself in a twist.
- Wait! I have money!

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.851
I have money in my bag!
I have money in my bag!

01:07:18.987 --> 01:07:22.024
OK. The earrings, I need them.

01:07:22.157 --> 01:07:25.324
What earrings? Look,
I'm not who you think. Please.

01:07:25.452 --> 01:07:29.284
All right, all right, avoid the fate
of your late beloved boyfriend.

01:07:46.682 --> 01:07:48.721
Was he your pimp?

01:07:48.851 --> 01:07:50.890
What?

01:07:51.019 --> 01:07:53.059
All right, play it that way.

01:07:53.188 --> 01:07:57.316
Come on, you've just got a little
bump on your head. You'll survive it.

01:08:03.657 --> 01:08:05.697
What's your name?

01:08:05.826 --> 01:08:07.865
You got a name, don't you?

01:08:07.995 --> 01:08:11.245
All right, we'll settle this
at the station house.

01:08:13.125 --> 01:08:15.201
- Roberta.
- Roberta. That's a name.

01:08:15.335 --> 01:08:17.375
I'm not who you think I am.

01:08:23.176 --> 01:08:25.216
How do you use the birds?

01:08:40.027 --> 01:08:42.066
Nice place you got here, Gar.

01:08:42.196 --> 01:08:44.234
We like it.

01:08:48.452 --> 01:08:49.732
Firm.

01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:51.908
Y-Yeah.

01:08:55.375 --> 01:08:57.415
They're Roberta's.

01:08:59.962 --> 01:09:02.288
"How To Be Your Own Best Friend."

01:09:02.966 --> 01:09:05.006
"I'm OK - You're OK."

01:09:05.928 --> 01:09:07.966
"Dr Ruth's Guide To Good Sex."

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.720
Are these Roberta's, too?

01:09:10.849 --> 01:09:13.174
I didn't know she read this stuff.

01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:15.350
You know, Gar, between you and me,...

01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:18.433
what do you really
know about Roberta?

01:09:18.857 --> 01:09:20.897
Nice wallpaper.

01:09:37.667 --> 01:09:40.455
Don't you think you ought
to wait for Roberta...

01:09:40.587 --> 01:09:42.662
before you start taking her clothes?

01:09:42.798 --> 01:09:44.837
She owes me a coat.

01:09:55.352 --> 01:09:57.510
- What does she weigh?
- Roberta?

01:09:57.646 --> 01:09:59.639
105, 110.

01:09:59.773 --> 01:10:02.264
We're close. Very close.

01:10:04.611 --> 01:10:08.146
- Nice tub.
- You like it?

01:10:08.282 --> 01:10:11.733
That's... It's one of
our most popular items.

01:10:11.869 --> 01:10:16.744
You can install it in any bathroom and it
increases the resale value of your home.

01:10:16.874 --> 01:10:18.831
I didn't say I wanted to buy one.

01:10:18.959 --> 01:10:20.998
Right. Sorry.

01:10:23.172 --> 01:10:26.505
You know, I could get
used to a place like this.

01:10:26.675 --> 01:10:28.502
Got any pot?

01:10:29.428 --> 01:10:31.586
P-pot.

01:10:31.722 --> 01:10:33.880
usually I keep some around,...

01:10:34.016 --> 01:10:36.507
but r-right now I'm out.

01:10:36.643 --> 01:10:38.683
You know how it is.

01:10:39.938 --> 01:10:42.264
How about a match?

01:10:42.399 --> 01:10:44.439
All right, stop.

01:10:44.943 --> 01:10:46.687
Face forward.

01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.729
Smile.

01:10:48.864 --> 01:10:50.903
Turn left.

01:10:51.909 --> 01:10:53.948
Next.

01:10:54.077 --> 01:10:56.236
And then you start to think,...

01:10:56.371 --> 01:10:58.411
what's it all about?

01:10:59.708 --> 01:11:02.080
The big picture,
you know what I mean?

01:11:02.753 --> 01:11:04.792
Sure I do, Gar.

01:11:04.922 --> 01:11:06.961
I mean, there...

01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:09.712
There's more to life than
making money, right?

01:11:09.843 --> 01:11:11.800
I mean, I know that. I mean...

01:11:11.929 --> 01:11:13.968
Oh...

01:11:18.393 --> 01:11:20.552
You know... You know how...

01:11:20.687 --> 01:11:24.103
all time comes from a single
point in the universe?

01:11:25.317 --> 01:11:27.393
- You know what I mean?
- No.

01:11:36.828 --> 01:11:38.868
My husband.

01:11:40.249 --> 01:11:42.325
We live in Fort Lee.

01:11:42.859 --> 01:11:44.682
There are...

01:11:44.711 --> 01:11:49.420
things happening in solar
systems so far away...

01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:51.708
that we can't even see them.

01:11:56.265 --> 01:11:58.506
I mean, what do... what do they care?

01:11:58.642 --> 01:12:01.477
What do they care if I am
the spa king of New Jersey?

01:12:01.603 --> 01:12:03.726
Hello. Glass house.

01:12:05.858 --> 01:12:07.897
Hello?

01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:10.817
- Hello?
- Spa king of New Jersey!

01:12:12.781 --> 01:12:14.904
Spa king!

01:12:18.996 --> 01:12:21.534
Could I call someone else? Please?

01:12:22.916 --> 01:12:24.956
Go ahead.

01:12:49.193 --> 01:12:51.269
All right. You in the pink tutu.

01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:53.609
Let's go.

01:12:59.203 --> 01:13:01.242
Nice to have met you.

01:13:03.916 --> 01:13:05.955
She better have a good explanation!

01:13:06.084 --> 01:13:08.207
You haven't seen her
and you're yelling.

01:13:08.337 --> 01:13:13.082
I am not! I am wondering aloud why she
couldn't have called if she was in trouble!

01:13:13.217 --> 01:13:16.171
Hear her side of it before
you do anything stupid!

01:13:16.303 --> 01:13:19.090
Mr Glass. Sergeant Taskal.
Have a seat.

01:13:19.223 --> 01:13:21.511
My sister Leslie.

01:13:22.351 --> 01:13:25.268
She was arrested last night
on the Lower East Side.

01:13:25.395 --> 01:13:28.978
She's in a holding tank downstairs.
I'll have her brought up.

01:13:29.107 --> 01:13:33.152
I telephoned you as soon as I
realised the photographs matched up.

01:13:33.278 --> 01:13:35.567
Hey, Ronnie. Taskal here.
Bring up Glass.

01:13:37.115 --> 01:13:39.737
We're dropping the charges.
Her husband is here.

01:13:39.868 --> 01:13:42.573
Well, obviously he hasn't
picked her up yet.

01:13:44.623 --> 01:13:46.414
Oh, Roberta.

01:13:46.542 --> 01:13:47.870
Let me see that.

01:13:48.001 --> 01:13:50.041
Oh, my God.

01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:56.007
Mr Glass, somebody paid your wife's bail
a little while ago and she was released.

01:13:56.134 --> 01:13:57.593
You just missed her.

01:13:57.719 --> 01:13:59.546
Who-Who paid her bail?

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.886
Boyfriend. Pimp. Who knows?

01:14:02.015 --> 01:14:04.055
Pimp?

01:14:06.019 --> 01:14:09.388
I don't know how to thank you, Dez.
I'm really sorry.

01:14:09.523 --> 01:14:11.562
Consider it my final favour, Susan.

01:14:11.692 --> 01:14:14.230
You are really living up
to your reputation.

01:14:14.611 --> 01:14:16.520
See, now, that's just it, Dez.

01:14:16.655 --> 01:14:19.276
That's it! I'm not
who you think I am.

01:14:19.408 --> 01:14:22.029
- I don't care who you are.
- No, no, I didn't mean it that way.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:24.367
It's really getting
complicated here. I'm not...

01:14:24.496 --> 01:14:26.536
Sssh. Stay right there.

01:14:40.429 --> 01:14:43.264
I don't believe it.

01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:45.133
God!

01:14:53.317 --> 01:14:56.187
I don't believe
Victoria would do this.

01:14:57.863 --> 01:15:00.069
Oh, my God.

01:15:00.199 --> 01:15:03.069
Maybe it was the guy who
grabbed me last night.

01:15:03.202 --> 01:15:05.241
What?

01:15:05.746 --> 01:15:07.785
The guy who grabbed you?

01:15:08.165 --> 01:15:10.074
See, he was after me, Dez.

01:15:10.209 --> 01:15:12.878
Well, not me exactly.
He was after Susan,...

01:15:13.003 --> 01:15:14.830
wherever she is, who I'm not!

01:15:14.963 --> 01:15:17.252
He thinks she's staying here,
which she isn't because I am...

01:15:17.382 --> 01:15:19.422
I don't wanna hear it!

01:15:19.551 --> 01:15:22.801
First of all, I get thrown out
on my ass on the sidewalk.

01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:26.678
Then I have to fork up $200
bail to get you out of jail.

01:15:26.808 --> 01:15:31.601
Now I come home and the whole place
is torn apart. Why, I don't know!

01:15:32.189 --> 01:15:36.139
You know, I really don't need
this shit, Susan. I really don't.

01:15:36.276 --> 01:15:37.439
Fine.

01:15:37.569 --> 01:15:39.609
I'll leave.

01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:43.817
Whoops!

01:15:50.249 --> 01:15:53.000
You know, I could have been
killed last night, Dez!

01:15:53.126 --> 01:15:55.166
I was really scared!

01:15:55.921 --> 01:15:57.332
Forget it.

01:15:57.464 --> 01:15:59.504
Sorry about this mess.

01:16:00.342 --> 01:16:03.177
I can pay you back!
I'll send you a cheque.

01:16:03.303 --> 01:16:05.343
Great. Another cheque.

01:16:29.872 --> 01:16:31.698
Sorry.

01:16:31.832 --> 01:16:33.871
Hey, hey, hey.

01:16:34.001 --> 01:16:36.539
This mess isn't so bad.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.245
I've had worse parties than this.

01:18:00.379 --> 01:18:02.952
Richard Nolan and Bruce
Meeker were released...

01:18:03.090 --> 01:18:06.091
pending appeal of their 1982
conviction for smuggling.

01:18:06.218 --> 01:18:10.547
They are prime suspects in the
disappearance of the Nefertiti earrings...

01:18:10.681 --> 01:18:14.263
from the Cairo collection
currently on display in New York.

01:18:14.476 --> 01:18:17.394
Nefertiti? No shit!

01:18:17.521 --> 01:18:20.094
It's not uncommon!
I've just read an article...

01:18:20.232 --> 01:18:23.482
about a woman who turned
tricks in the city all morning...

01:18:23.610 --> 01:18:26.101
and shopped all afternoon
before going home.

01:18:26.238 --> 01:18:29.441
She did it for years before her
husband found out about it.

01:18:29.575 --> 01:18:33.904
Roberta can't be a prostitute. She doesn't
like sex that much. It's impossible.

01:18:43.547 --> 01:18:48.754
Oh, my God. I have heard that four
out of five prostitutes are lesbians.

01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:54.052
Leslie, I think that I would
know if my wife was a lesbian.

01:18:54.183 --> 01:18:56.720
Why?! You didn't know
she was a prostitute.

01:18:57.561 --> 01:18:59.933
Gary, I think you have
got to accept the fact...

01:19:00.063 --> 01:19:03.895
that there is something very unusual
going on in your relationship.

01:19:04.026 --> 01:19:06.398
Susan.

01:19:06.528 --> 01:19:08.485
- Susan!
- Who's Susan?

01:19:08.614 --> 01:19:11.733
Don't get the wrong idea.
She was helping me find Roberta.

01:19:15.078 --> 01:19:17.118
Susan!

01:19:17.706 --> 01:19:19.699
Susan!

01:19:19.833 --> 01:19:21.625
What are you doing here?

01:19:21.752 --> 01:19:24.669
I got good news and bad news.
What do you want first?

01:19:24.796 --> 01:19:27.418
- You said you were going to leave.
- OK, good news.

01:19:27.549 --> 01:19:29.625
Your wife isn't with the greaseball.

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:33.627
Susan, my wife has just been
picked up on the Lower East Side,...

01:19:33.764 --> 01:19:36.469
escaping from her gun-toting pimp!

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.549
He's not a pimp.

01:19:37.684 --> 01:19:39.642
- He's not a pimp.
- He's not a pimp.

01:19:39.770 --> 01:19:43.055
The bad news is he'll probably
kill her cos he thinks she's me.

01:19:43.190 --> 01:19:45.229
- What?
- Didn't you ever read this?

01:19:45.359 --> 01:19:47.316
She kept a diary.

01:19:47.444 --> 01:19:49.769
It's great stuff. "Couldn't sleep."

01:19:49.905 --> 01:19:53.108
"Went into kitchen.
Gary came in. Turned on light."

01:19:53.242 --> 01:19:56.159
"Gary left. Finished birthday cake."

01:19:56.286 --> 01:20:00.948
Pages of it. It's gotta be a cover.
Nobody's life could be this boring.

01:20:01.083 --> 01:20:03.574
You shouldn't be reading that.
It's private.

01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:07.126
Yeah, well, it's not about her.
It's about me. Listen to this.

01:20:07.256 --> 01:20:10.589
"He's looking for Susan again.
She's late returning from Mexico."

01:20:10.717 --> 01:20:12.675
"This is his fifth ad."

01:20:12.803 --> 01:20:16.136
"Why does he want to see
her so badly? Who is she?"

01:20:16.265 --> 01:20:18.506
And there's my picture.

01:20:19.434 --> 01:20:22.601
Gary, why didn't you tell
me she read the personals?

01:20:22.729 --> 01:20:24.769
We could've settled this yesterday.

01:20:24.898 --> 01:20:27.650
She read them all the time.
I didn't think...

01:20:27.776 --> 01:20:32.319
Yeah, well, fortunately for everybody,
I'm here and I'm thinking.

01:20:32.447 --> 01:20:34.487
Give me the car keys.

01:20:37.035 --> 01:20:39.158
I'll bring it right back.

01:20:39.288 --> 01:20:40.865
Hiya.

01:20:41.623 --> 01:20:44.577
Gary! She is taking the car keys!

01:20:46.753 --> 01:20:49.541
Shut up, Leslie. OK?

01:20:50.674 --> 01:20:55.135
Diary. That little sneak,
what did she say about me?

01:21:18.785 --> 01:21:22.071
"Desperately seeking
stranger seeking Susan."

01:21:22.206 --> 01:21:26.452
"Regarding key. Meet me Saturday night,
Magic Club, Broadway. 9.30pm. Be there."

01:21:26.585 --> 01:21:28.791
- Is that it?
- She'll love it.

01:21:28.921 --> 01:21:30.960
Pay at the cashier.

01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:38.046
"Single white male, 40,
looking for afternoon playmates."

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:41.465
Is that it? Pay at the cashier.

01:21:56.198 --> 01:21:58.025
Dez...

01:21:59.993 --> 01:22:02.033
I'm not Susan.

01:22:03.163 --> 01:22:06.247
I'm a housewife and I live
in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

01:22:07.125 --> 01:22:09.581
I've been married for four years.

01:22:09.711 --> 01:22:11.371
My husband Gary...

01:22:11.505 --> 01:22:15.668
He sells bathroom spas and saunas.

01:22:21.014 --> 01:22:23.054
You never stop, do you?

01:22:23.183 --> 01:22:25.390
No, really! Really!

01:22:25.519 --> 01:22:30.145
That's why I like you. I never know
what you'll say next. Come here.

01:22:35.785 --> 01:22:36.939
Dez.

01:22:39.157 --> 01:22:41.197
- What is that?
- I dunno.

01:22:43.537 --> 01:22:45.576
Someone's trying to get in.

01:22:55.757 --> 01:22:57.750
Oh, my God.

01:22:57.885 --> 01:22:59.877
Oh, my God, it's Jim.

01:23:00.012 --> 01:23:02.051
Oh, my God.

01:23:05.017 --> 01:23:08.551
Jim... Jim. Jim.

01:23:09.021 --> 01:23:14.062
Thank God. You had me worried.
How you doing, man? Huh? Huh?

01:23:14.193 --> 01:23:17.063
Somebody jumped me. It was dark.

01:23:17.779 --> 01:23:19.938
Yeah.

01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:22.530
It was me.

01:23:23.285 --> 01:23:25.823
I thought you were somebody else.

01:23:25.954 --> 01:23:27.994
Who did you think I was?

01:23:29.583 --> 01:23:33.166
Somebody's been following Susan.
I thought maybe you were him.

01:23:33.295 --> 01:23:35.252
Who's following her?

01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:37.124
I don't know.

01:23:37.257 --> 01:23:39.049
You know Susan.

01:23:39.176 --> 01:23:42.627
It's really tough to get a
straight answer out of her.

01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:46.883
She needs me, Dez.

01:23:47.017 --> 01:23:49.342
I think maybe she's
ready to settle down.

01:23:49.478 --> 01:23:53.939
Settle down? Susan? Come on, Jim!

01:23:54.066 --> 01:23:57.150
She'd never do that.
She's really not the type.

01:23:57.277 --> 01:23:59.270
Since when do you know her so well?

01:23:59.404 --> 01:24:03.485
Well, I just can't see her settling down.
I mean, she's too wild.

01:24:03.617 --> 01:24:05.942
But that's what's so great about her.

01:24:06.078 --> 01:24:07.655
Is that so?

01:24:07.788 --> 01:24:11.121
I mean, you really seem
to have examined this.

01:24:11.834 --> 01:24:14.918
Well, we've been spending
some time together.

01:24:17.965 --> 01:24:20.716
Just... what are you
saying here, Dez?

01:24:20.843 --> 01:24:22.253
Huh?

01:24:24.721 --> 01:24:26.963
I'm not gonna bullshit you, Jim.

01:24:27.099 --> 01:24:30.183
It was a shitty thing to do.
I'm not saying it wasn't.

01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:34.057
But you yourself said
she was irresistible.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.439
Oh, man.

01:24:38.569 --> 01:24:42.068
W-why don't you just hit me
again and, like, finish me off?

01:24:42.197 --> 01:24:44.237
- Look...
- Huh?!

01:24:44.366 --> 01:24:46.904
Don't cry about it.
I'm really crazy about her...

01:24:47.035 --> 01:24:49.028
and she's really crazy about me.

01:24:49.162 --> 01:24:51.488
- I'm sorry.
- Listen. I know Susan.

01:24:51.623 --> 01:24:53.830
Whatever she told
you doesn't mean shit.

01:24:53.959 --> 01:24:58.122
She plays with people, Dez. I oughta
know, I've been chasing her for years.

01:24:58.255 --> 01:25:00.627
I don't think she's playing with me.

01:25:00.757 --> 01:25:02.797
Bullshit.

01:25:03.552 --> 01:25:05.426
All right, Jim.

01:25:05.554 --> 01:25:07.593
Why don't we just ask her?

01:25:10.142 --> 01:25:11.553
Susan!

01:25:11.685 --> 01:25:13.974
Su...! You mean she's here?!

01:25:15.355 --> 01:25:16.766
Susan!

01:25:16.899 --> 01:25:19.354
- Come on out here.
- Susan...!

01:25:22.946 --> 01:25:24.986
Susan!

01:25:34.458 --> 01:25:36.497
She's gone.

01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:40.377
She was here.

01:25:40.506 --> 01:25:42.545
I swear to God.

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:36.599
Dez, are you up there?

01:26:38.021 --> 01:26:39.681
Yeah?

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.484
Guess what, man? I think
she's jerking us both around.

01:26:44.611 --> 01:26:46.236
What do you mean?

01:26:46.363 --> 01:26:49.814
Check this out. I mean,
who the hell is this stranger?

01:27:05.799 --> 01:27:08.468
Susan, I still don't
understand why we're here.

01:27:08.594 --> 01:27:10.882
Trust me, Gar.
You're in for a real surprise.

01:27:11.013 --> 01:27:13.930
Your surprises are beginning
to make me nervous.

01:27:14.057 --> 01:27:16.845
- What'd she say?
- We're in for a real surprise.

01:27:16.977 --> 01:27:19.433
I guess we're not gonna
see Tony Bennett here.

01:27:19.563 --> 01:27:21.602
I'd settle for a police escort.

01:27:21.732 --> 01:27:24.567
How could you let her
wear Roberta's jacket?

01:27:24.693 --> 01:27:28.821
Hey, she's cold.
She's gotta wear something.

01:27:28.947 --> 01:27:31.319
Why don't you cut your fingernails?

01:27:31.450 --> 01:27:33.739
I can't hear what you're saying...

01:27:40.417 --> 01:27:44.367
Dez, if she sees us both here,
she'll probably just split again.

01:27:44.505 --> 01:27:46.544
You could go home.

01:27:46.673 --> 01:27:49.627
I wanna see who this
fuckin' stranger is.

01:27:56.725 --> 01:28:00.805
Let me guess. Triple tequila sunrise.

01:28:00.938 --> 01:28:03.014
Ginger ale.

01:28:05.817 --> 01:28:07.727
And you're the Scotch.

01:28:07.861 --> 01:28:09.770
This must be yours.

01:28:09.905 --> 01:28:11.944
Rum and Tab.

01:28:16.495 --> 01:28:19.365
Sit tight. I'm gonna go
look for the stranger.

01:28:20.332 --> 01:28:22.372
What stranger?

01:28:22.501 --> 01:28:25.668
- God, she's gorgeous.
- Beauty fades.

01:28:38.767 --> 01:28:40.261
There she is.

01:28:40.394 --> 01:28:43.679
- Where?
- Right there. Talking to the cigarette girl.

01:28:43.814 --> 01:28:46.601
That's not Susan. I never
even seen that girl before.

01:28:46.733 --> 01:28:49.355
Dez, that's Susan.
Don't you think I should know?

01:28:50.279 --> 01:28:53.695
That might be a Susan
but that's not my Susan.

01:28:53.824 --> 01:28:57.407
- That's my Susan.
- Then who was the girl at Battery Park?

01:29:13.468 --> 01:29:15.461
So who's the stranger?

01:29:15.596 --> 01:29:17.672
Jimmy!

01:29:17.806 --> 01:29:19.846
Who's the stranger?

01:29:19.975 --> 01:29:22.466
- It's a long story.
- Huh.

01:29:22.603 --> 01:29:24.726
You wouldn't know her anyway.

01:29:24.855 --> 01:29:26.894
- Her?
- Yeah. Her.

01:29:29.651 --> 01:29:32.321
Come on. We'll talk
about it in private.

01:29:37.201 --> 01:29:39.822
We've got three minutes
before curtain!

01:29:39.953 --> 01:29:41.993
Get your wig on and get out there!

01:29:50.339 --> 01:29:52.331
I wonder what happened to Susan.

01:29:52.466 --> 01:29:54.708
Looks like you lost your girlfriend.

01:29:54.843 --> 01:29:57.168
Hey, Larry! I'm married, all right?

01:29:57.304 --> 01:29:59.593
- Oh, please!
- What?

01:30:06.522 --> 01:30:09.143
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

01:30:09.274 --> 01:30:12.560
Welcome to the Magic Club.
I'm your host, Ray...

01:30:14.112 --> 01:30:16.983
Bartender... Can I have
the check, please?

01:30:18.617 --> 01:30:21.488
Hey, is there anyone out
here from... Queens?

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:24.111
You. Well, I'm from
normal parents myself.

01:30:25.582 --> 01:30:29.995
Anyway, we got a special treat
for you people this evening.

01:30:30.128 --> 01:30:32.584
Introducing the one, the only...

01:30:33.048 --> 01:30:35.088
Susan, get up here!

01:30:35.217 --> 01:30:38.502
and his very lovely
assistant, Davina...

01:30:38.637 --> 01:30:41.923
Queen of the Night! So let's hear it!

01:30:52.901 --> 01:30:56.104
Gary... Is that...

01:30:56.238 --> 01:30:58.729
It can't be.

01:30:58.866 --> 01:31:01.701
I'm really enjoying this.
It's a great trick.

01:31:10.294 --> 01:31:12.085
Susan?

01:31:12.212 --> 01:31:15.166
- Roberta?
- I don't believe it.

01:31:15.924 --> 01:31:18.711
- Roberta...
- Gary, sit down.

01:31:26.393 --> 01:31:28.884
I think I'll be staying, thank you.

01:31:52.461 --> 01:31:55.378
Cigars? Cigarettes?

01:31:57.591 --> 01:31:59.833
She's really got style in a way.

01:31:59.968 --> 01:32:02.008
She's good, Gary.

01:32:03.639 --> 01:32:05.678
Right. Sorry.

01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:50.177
Bravo!

01:32:54.982 --> 01:32:57.651
That's him. That's the guy.

01:33:00.696 --> 01:33:01.775
That's the guy!

01:33:01.905 --> 01:33:03.697
Hey, help me!

01:33:04.283 --> 01:33:07.200
Hey! That's the guy!
That's the guy! Help!

01:33:07.327 --> 01:33:10.946
Somebody stop that guy! Help!

01:33:15.002 --> 01:33:17.125
What... Roberta!

01:33:17.254 --> 01:33:19.662
- Roberta!
- Who are you?

01:33:22.009 --> 01:33:24.048
What's going on?!

01:33:29.516 --> 01:33:31.805
- Did he hurt you? I'll kill him!
- Gary!

01:33:31.935 --> 01:33:34.972
- It's OK, I can take care of it now.
- Who is this guy?

01:33:35.105 --> 01:33:37.145
Who are you?
What do you mean, who am I?

01:33:37.274 --> 01:33:39.101
- Please...
- Oh.

01:33:40.986 --> 01:33:43.394
Gary... Dez.

01:33:43.530 --> 01:33:46.200
Dez, this is Gary, my husband.

01:33:47.034 --> 01:33:48.861
Hi.

01:33:48.994 --> 01:33:51.995
- The hot-tub salesman?
- Yeah.

01:33:52.122 --> 01:33:54.957
So you were telling me
the truth last night.

01:33:55.083 --> 01:33:57.123
Last night? Oh, no.

01:33:57.252 --> 01:33:59.577
- Did you spend the night with him?
- Gary...

01:33:59.713 --> 01:34:02.584
- Is he the pimp the police mentioned?
- He's not a pimp!

01:34:02.716 --> 01:34:04.756
I'm not a pimp. I'm a friend of hers.

01:34:04.885 --> 01:34:07.921
- Somebody tell me what's going on!
- I'm not sure myself.

01:34:08.055 --> 01:34:10.094
- I'm having a hard time...
- So am I!

01:34:10.224 --> 01:34:13.806
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Please, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:34:13.936 --> 01:34:15.346
OK, listen.

01:34:15.479 --> 01:34:20.390
Dez. Dez, I really need to talk
to Gary alone, OK? Please?

01:34:21.443 --> 01:34:22.985
OK.

01:34:23.111 --> 01:34:25.567
I really need some time alone too.

01:34:26.406 --> 01:34:28.446
I'm sorry.

01:34:37.459 --> 01:34:41.077
It's all right. It's all right.
The nightmare's over.

01:34:55.227 --> 01:34:58.394
Don't make a peep.
You're gonna get me outta here.

01:35:00.774 --> 01:35:02.814
Nice legs.

01:35:06.738 --> 01:35:09.775
- I don't understand why you're here.
- Why are you here?

01:35:09.908 --> 01:35:12.695
Wait a minute. Never mind that.
Why did you leave me?

01:35:12.828 --> 01:35:14.737
It was sort of an accident.

01:35:14.872 --> 01:35:17.659
When you were soliciting,
that was an accident, too?

01:35:17.791 --> 01:35:19.831
Yes, of course! Gary!

01:35:20.252 --> 01:35:22.541
It all started with the personals.

01:35:22.671 --> 01:35:25.707
There was this ad for Susan.
"Desperately seeking Susan."

01:35:32.264 --> 01:35:34.257
Where did he go?

01:35:34.391 --> 01:35:37.060
So they thought I was a
prostitute and arrested me.

01:35:37.186 --> 01:35:39.059
Roberta, are you a lesbian?

01:35:39.188 --> 01:35:41.725
Leslie said lots of
prostitutes are lesbians.

01:35:41.857 --> 01:35:45.440
Gary, you're not listening to me.
I'm not a prostitute or a lesbian!

01:35:45.569 --> 01:35:48.938
We'll get professional help.
I don't care how much it costs.

01:35:49.072 --> 01:35:53.117
- I just want you to come home with me.
- Why?

01:35:53.243 --> 01:35:55.734
Why? What do you mean, why?

01:35:55.871 --> 01:35:57.947
Why do you want me to
come home with you?

01:35:58.081 --> 01:36:00.074
Come on, don't get
excited, all right?

01:36:00.209 --> 01:36:02.331
What, are you on drugs
or something now?

01:36:02.461 --> 01:36:04.453
God.

01:36:04.588 --> 01:36:06.296
Look at me.

01:36:06.423 --> 01:36:09.092
I looked at you. You look ridiculous.

01:36:09.218 --> 01:36:12.836
I mean look at me, Gary. Look at me.

01:36:20.479 --> 01:36:23.100
I'm not coming home with you.

01:36:24.441 --> 01:36:26.730
You're just tired.

01:36:29.279 --> 01:36:32.731
Why don't you get changed
and we'll talk about it at home?

01:36:32.866 --> 01:36:34.610
Come on. Come on.

01:36:38.705 --> 01:36:40.081
Fine. That's fine.

01:36:40.207 --> 01:36:44.785
I'm gonna go outside and
I'm gonna wait for five minutes.

01:36:46.630 --> 01:36:49.501
And if you're not there,
I'm gonna leave without you.

01:36:51.218 --> 01:36:53.257
Goodbye, Gary.

01:37:26.003 --> 01:37:28.042
Hey! Whoa!

01:37:33.010 --> 01:37:35.049
Where did you get this?

01:37:36.263 --> 01:37:38.302
Stay!

01:37:44.563 --> 01:37:46.602
Susan, what's going on?

01:37:54.698 --> 01:37:55.978
Help me!

01:37:57.618 --> 01:37:59.444
Don't push!

01:38:10.047 --> 01:38:12.039
Good goin', stranger.

01:38:12.174 --> 01:38:14.213
Susan.

01:38:24.853 --> 01:38:26.329
Hi.

01:38:27.064 --> 01:38:29.103
What's going on?

01:38:29.233 --> 01:38:31.391
My friend, this is
the crucial moment.

01:38:31.902 --> 01:38:35.235
Our force field power plant has
been transferred to the ship.

01:38:35.405 --> 01:38:38.609
Our defences are at their weakest,
almost fully automatic.

01:38:38.742 --> 01:38:42.609
The likelihood of a successful
mutant attack is at its strongest.

01:38:42.746 --> 01:38:47.075
- But they may be unaware.
- We've tried to keep them away...

01:39:03.976 --> 01:39:06.763
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:39:08.897 --> 01:39:11.934
Huh. How are you doin'?

01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:14.899
OK.

01:39:17.239 --> 01:39:19.944
So I guess your name
isn't Susan, huh?

01:39:21.368 --> 01:39:23.408
So what is it?

01:39:23.537 --> 01:39:26.491
Roberta.

01:39:26.623 --> 01:39:29.494
Roberta.

01:39:31.753 --> 01:39:33.793
That's nice.

01:39:51.023 --> 01:39:53.181
Come on!

01:40:00.532 --> 01:40:02.572
<i>And you can dance!</i>

01:40:04.203 --> 01:40:06.325
<i>For inspiration</i>

01:40:08.832 --> 01:40:10.872
<i>Come on, come on, come on</i>

01:40:12.544 --> 01:40:14.122
<i>I'm waiting</i>

01:40:14.671 --> 01:40:16.448
<i>Get into the groove</i>

01:40:16.548 --> 01:40:22.589
<i>Boy, you've got to prove
your love to me</i>

01:40:22.689 --> 01:40:26.834
<i>Get up on your feet, yeah
Yeah, step to the beat</i>

01:40:26.934 --> 01:40:30.575
<i>Boy, what will it be?</i>

01:40:30.687 --> 01:40:34.908
<i>Music can be such a revelation</i>

01:40:35.008 --> 01:40:39.496
<i>Dancing around
You feel the sweet sensation</i>

01:40:39.596 --> 01:40:43.559
<i>We might be lovers
if the rhythm's right</i>

01:40:43.659 --> 01:40:47.571
<i>I hope this feeling
never ends tonight</i>

01:40:47.671 --> 01:40:51.867
<i>Only when I'm dancing
can I feel this free</i>

01:40:51.967 --> 01:40:56.080
<i>At night I lock the doors
where no one else can see</i>

01:40:56.180 --> 01:41:00.042
<i>I'm tired of dancing
here all by myself</i>

01:41:00.142 --> 01:41:04.505
<i>Tonight I wanna dance
with someone else</i>

01:41:04.605 --> 01:41:06.340
<i>Get into the groove</i>

01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:12.567
<i>Boy, you've got to prove
your love to me, yeah</i>

01:41:12.696 --> 01:41:16.642
<i>Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat</i>

01:41:16.742 --> 01:41:19.853
<i>Boy, what will it be?</i>

01:41:19.953 --> 01:41:23.899
<i>Gonna get to know you
in a special way</i>

01:41:23.999 --> 01:41:29.196
<i>This doesn't happen to me every day</i>

01:41:29.296 --> 01:41:33.450
<i>Don't try to hide it,
love wears no disguise</i>

01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:37.621
<i>I see the fire burning in your eyes</i>

01:41:37.721 --> 01:41:41.542
<i>Only when I'm dancing
can I feel this free</i>

01:41:41.642 --> 01:41:45.880
<i>At night I lock the doors
where no one else can see</i>

01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:49.842
<i>I'm tired of dancing
here all by myself</i>

01:41:49.942 --> 01:41:54.221
<i>Tonight I wanna dance
with someone else</i>

01:41:54.321 --> 01:41:56.223
<i>Get into the groove</i>

01:41:56.323 --> 01:42:02.521
<i>Boy, you've got to prove
your love to me yeah</i>

01:42:02.621 --> 01:42:06.650
<i>Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat</i>

01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:10.833
<i>Boy, what will it be?</i>

01:42:11.005 --> 01:42:15.534
<i>Live out your fantasy here with me</i>

01:42:15.634 --> 01:42:19.962
<i>Just let the music set you free</i>

01:42:20.097 --> 01:42:23.972
<i>Touch my body and move in time</i>

01:42:24.101 --> 01:42:27.351
<i>Now I know you're mine</i>

01:42:28.022 --> 01:42:30.132
<i>Get into the groove</i>

01:42:30.232 --> 01:42:35.927
<i>Boy, you've got to
prove your love to me</i>

01:42:36.322 --> 01:42:40.351
<i>Get up on your feet
yeah, step to the beat</i>

01:42:40.451 --> 01:42:44.271
