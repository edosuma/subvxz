WEBVTT

00:09.542 --> 00:11.500
Mom, there's
nothing to do here.

00:11.583 --> 00:13.750
Well, you can help me
take out this trash.

00:13.834 --> 00:15.834
That's not fun.

00:15.917 --> 00:18.333
Well, then play
with Hammy for God sakes.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Why do you keep
looking out the
window?

00:26.083 --> 00:28.000
Daddy isn't coming.

00:28.083 --> 00:30.458
If he does,
you remember what I told you?

00:30.542 --> 00:33.166
'You hide behind the counter.'

00:33.250 --> 00:34.834
Do you hear me, Susan?

00:47.208 --> 00:49.583
I wanna go home.

00:49.667 --> 00:52.166
Well, we're not going home.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.917
Where are we gonna sleep?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.291
What about my clothes
and my book bag?

00:56.375 --> 00:57.917
My stuff?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.625
We'll buy new things.

01:00.709 --> 01:02.959
You can't barely buy anything.

01:06.625 --> 01:08.792
We're gonna be okay.

01:08.875 --> 01:11.250
'You might not
believe it right now..'

01:11.333 --> 01:13.667
...but it's true.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.667
'Hey.'

01:17.750 --> 01:19.667
I love you, little girl.

02:06.583 --> 02:09.792
Don't, please don't, pl..

02:09.875 --> 02:12.125
Ple..

02:31.208 --> 02:33.417
(Lilly)
Her body was
found by
hikers.

02:33.500 --> 02:34.709
A dog dug it up.

02:34.792 --> 02:37.041
Good place to dump
a body this preserve.

02:37.125 --> 02:39.375
Yeah, nothing but
woods for miles.

02:39.458 --> 02:42.083
Only witnesses are
the birds and the
bees.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.917
We get an ID yet, boss?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.583
(John)
'From a medic alert
bracelet.'

02:50.667 --> 02:52.291
Janet Lambert.

02:52.375 --> 02:54.750
White female,
31 years of age.

02:54.834 --> 02:57.667
Reported missing in '85.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.959
Disappeared from
her place of work.

03:00.041 --> 03:02.542
Last to see was her
11-year-old daughter.

03:02.625 --> 03:05.250
Mom goes out with the trash
and never comes back.

03:06.166 --> 03:07.250
Poor kid.

03:09.333 --> 03:10.917
From her chest cavity.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.291
Shattered the ribcage.

03:13.959 --> 03:15.125
Hell of a slug.

03:15.208 --> 03:16.959
There's no bullet hole
in the clothes.

03:17.041 --> 03:19.333
So the doer stripped her
before shooting her.

03:19.417 --> 03:20.792
Makes sense.

03:20.875 --> 03:23.125
(Lilly)
Now that we know her name..

03:23.208 --> 03:24.667
...next question.

03:27.458 --> 03:28.542
Where's her head?

04:01.667 --> 04:03.166
(Lilly)
Janet Lambert
worked in night shift

04:03.250 --> 04:05.500
at a 24-hour convenience store
off the boulevard.

04:05.583 --> 04:09.125
Where she disappeared
from night of November 2, 1985.

04:09.208 --> 04:12.834
Prime suspect at the time was
her husband, Leroy Lambert.

04:12.917 --> 04:14.834
Says here, same day
Janet goes missing.

04:14.917 --> 04:17.875
She filed domestic abuse
charges against hubby.

04:17.959 --> 04:19.834
Walked out for beating her up

04:19.917 --> 04:22.041
in front of their
11-year-old daughter.

04:22.125 --> 04:23.750
Leaving, cost Janet her life.

04:23.834 --> 04:27.875
And her head. Takes a lot of
hate, doing something like
that.

04:27.959 --> 04:30.500
The kid, Susan,
says, "Dad came to the store

04:30.583 --> 04:31.917
right before mom disappeared."

04:32.000 --> 04:33.583
(Lilly)
'Not much of an ID.'

04:33.667 --> 04:37.000
All she saw were
a pair of men's boots.

04:37.083 --> 04:39.166
Well, how'd that go down?

04:39.250 --> 04:40.667
Mom told her to hide
behind the counter

04:40.750 --> 04:43.583
if someone came in,
afraid it might be dad.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.417
Loving patriarch, this Leroy.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.917
Missing persons couldn't
pin him to it in '85.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Guy's alibi was solid.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.125
Well, maybe it's crumbled some.

04:59.291 --> 05:01.417
I was at the bowling alley
when Janet had gone missing.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.542
Whole place saw me sitting
up there at the bar.

05:03.625 --> 05:06.625
Bunch of drunks passed out in
their beers. Real reliable.

05:06.709 --> 05:09.959
Bartender, too.
He didn't touch a drop.

05:10.041 --> 05:12.625
- Nice.
- Helps me think straight.

05:12.709 --> 05:15.375
Think about this,
your wife's head was cut off.

05:15.458 --> 05:18.041
Sicko who did that had
a personal score to settle.

05:18.125 --> 05:21.375
The way we hear it, you've got
a mighty long score, Leroy.

05:21.458 --> 05:23.875
That bitch had it coming
for what she did to me.

05:25.041 --> 05:28.542
(Janet)
Susan, time to eat!

05:28.625 --> 05:31.375
I want my breakfast.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.375
I promised Susan
I'd take her to the mall.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.917
I can cook you up something
hot when I get home.

05:37.291 --> 05:39.750
I don't eat breakfast
out of no box!

05:39.834 --> 05:41.125
Susan's in the next room, Leroy.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.458
Please don't start
or she'll see..

05:43.542 --> 05:45.542
I ain't eating out of no box!

05:50.500 --> 05:52.500
Sweetheart, come on,
time for breakfast.

05:54.625 --> 05:57.166
(Janet)
Here you go, sweetie.

05:57.250 --> 05:58.625
I'm sorry,
honey,
I won't be able

05:58.709 --> 06:00.083
to take you
to the mall
today.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.166
Next time, I promise.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.750
You always break your promises.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.000
Don't sass your mother.

06:09.834 --> 06:10.917
Mom.

06:17.417 --> 06:18.375
Ow!

06:19.792 --> 06:22.625
touch

06:22.709 --> 06:23.917
...or

06:24.000 --> 06:25.750
Never again!

06:32.208 --> 06:33.834
That bitch walked out
on me then and there.

06:33.917 --> 06:34.834
I never saw her again.

06:34.917 --> 06:36.291
Your daughter
says different.

06:36.375 --> 06:38.000
Yeah, well, maybe what
happened up in that woods

06:38.083 --> 06:40.500
to Janet should have
happened to Susan, too.

06:40.583 --> 06:42.417
You're a real door prize, Leroy.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.667
Man-hating bitch,
just like her mother.

06:46.083 --> 06:47.959
I didn't kill Janet

06:48.041 --> 06:49.875
but I sure wish I did.

07:00.458 --> 07:04.500
I always hoped my mother
was out there, somewhere..

07:04.583 --> 07:05.875
...alive.

07:07.250 --> 07:10.667
And that day, she filed
domestic abuse charges..

07:10.750 --> 07:12.250
...against your father.

07:12.333 --> 07:15.250
Yes. Could I see that?

07:15.333 --> 07:17.750
At the store, right before
your mom disappeared

07:17.834 --> 07:19.333
'you said you
saw someone?'

07:19.417 --> 07:22.875
I know. It could've
been anyone's boots.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.709
I was just a kid...scared.

07:26.792 --> 07:29.500
Thought your dad
was coming for you.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.083
Your mom.

07:32.333 --> 07:33.917
"Walking On Sunshine?"

07:34.000 --> 07:34.959
What?

07:35.041 --> 07:36.667
It says it right here.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.417
(Susan)
'That song was
playing on the radio'

07:38.500 --> 07:40.417
when my father
was beating up my mom.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.417
Well, what does that have
to do with her disappearance?

07:43.500 --> 07:44.834
He was singing it.

07:44.917 --> 07:46.500
Who?

07:46.583 --> 07:49.250
The man who came
into the store that night.

07:50.959 --> 07:53.208
(Janet)
'Hey.'

07:53.291 --> 07:55.083
I love you, little girl.

08:42.959 --> 08:45.500
I waited and waited,
but he never came back.

08:47.166 --> 08:48.667
Neither did my mother.

08:48.750 --> 08:50.625
You're positive you
heard that song?

08:50.709 --> 08:52.125
I've never forgotten that day.

08:55.041 --> 08:56.500
Thanks for your time, Susan.

08:58.834 --> 09:00.500
The court sent me back to him.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.792
'After my mother disappeared.'

09:04.875 --> 09:07.500
What my father
couldn't do to her anymore,
he..

09:07.583 --> 09:09.750
...took out on me.

09:10.709 --> 09:11.959
I'm sorry.

09:13.458 --> 09:14.959
Yeah, me, too.

09:15.750 --> 09:19.125
Lil, Stillman called.

09:19.208 --> 09:20.709
Needs us at the woods.

09:25.750 --> 09:26.875
Alright copy
that.
This is 22.

09:26.959 --> 09:28.542
Guy in the store
could be Leroy.

09:28.625 --> 09:30.875
Gotta be Leroy. Now, who
else
would know about that song?

09:30.959 --> 09:32.125
What it meant to Janet?

09:32.208 --> 09:33.375
(Lilly)
'Hey, boss.'

09:33.458 --> 09:34.917
What's the rush?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.208
(John)
Canine unit uncovered
this.

09:37.291 --> 09:38.834
Routine sweep of
the crime scene.

09:38.917 --> 09:40.375
(John)
Single shot to the chest.

09:40.458 --> 09:41.792
(Will)
Large caliber
weapon.

09:41.875 --> 09:44.333
No holes in her clothes.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.000
- How many?
- Eight.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.750
- All headless?
- Yes, sir.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.000
(John)
'Three of the nine bodies
found'

09:58.083 --> 09:59.792
at the wildlife preserve
have been identified.

09:59.875 --> 10:01.583
Body number one, Janet Lambert.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.166
Now, we know she went missing
in November of '85.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.750
Body number two, Tina James.

10:06.834 --> 10:08.834
White female, 14 years old

10:08.917 --> 10:11.542
reported missing
in November '99.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.125
Number three, Latrice Hicks.

10:13.208 --> 10:14.959
Black female, 50 years old

10:15.041 --> 10:17.667
disappeared in 2001...November.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.917
Coroner's working
on identifying the others.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.166
(Will)
'No way Leroy's responsible.'

10:22.250 --> 10:25.250
Spent 1988 to 2001
in and out of lockup.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.125
Same dates our victims
went missing.

10:27.208 --> 10:28.208
All in November.

10:28.291 --> 10:29.291
'So, if it wasn't Leroy'

10:29.375 --> 10:31.458
how'd he know about the song?

10:31.542 --> 10:33.125
What we do know is,
he strips 'em

10:33.208 --> 10:34.542
probably rapes 'em,
shoots 'em.

10:34.625 --> 10:36.250
That doesn't explain
how he picks 'em.

10:36.333 --> 10:39.583
They've got nothing in common,
different races

10:39.667 --> 10:41.709
'ages, professions.'

10:41.792 --> 10:43.750
Most serial killers
have a type.

10:43.834 --> 10:46.792
Uniforms ID'd a possible
witness
in the wildlife preserve.

10:46.875 --> 10:48.125
Let's talk to him asap.

10:48.208 --> 10:49.625
Families are coming in?

10:49.709 --> 10:50.959
Yeah.

10:55.125 --> 10:58.375
I keep logs of illegal hunting
here on the wilderness
preserve.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.500
Poachers, hunters,
they come by at night

11:00.583 --> 11:02.458
trying to pinch
on some deer meat.

11:02.542 --> 11:06.333
You heard gunshots early
morning, November 3, 1985?

11:06.417 --> 11:09.083
Yeah, I was working. Logged 'em.

11:09.166 --> 11:11.250
Same night Janet Lambert
went missing.

11:11.333 --> 11:12.458
Yeah, I went out
and told that guy

11:12.542 --> 11:14.500
there ain't no huntin' here.

11:14.583 --> 11:16.208
Not on my watch.

11:25.583 --> 11:27.250
Hey!

11:27.333 --> 11:28.750
(male #1)
'Hey! I'm talking to you.'

11:30.625 --> 11:32.583
'There's no hunting
on this preserve.'

11:34.667 --> 11:36.041
What's in the bag?

11:40.166 --> 11:41.875
There's no hunting here.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.250
'You've been warned.'

11:54.834 --> 11:56.583
Real freak show that guy.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.750
And you never reported this?

11:58.834 --> 12:00.458
No, I thought
he was a poacher.

12:00.542 --> 12:02.834
Who cares about
that but us?

12:02.917 --> 12:05.125
You recorded shots at 5:00 a.m.?

12:05.208 --> 12:06.208
Yeah, that's right.

12:06.291 --> 12:07.291
But Janet went missing

12:07.375 --> 12:08.458
from the convenience store

12:08.542 --> 12:10.583
at around 9:00 p.m.

12:10.667 --> 12:13.291
So what was he doing
with her, all night?

12:18.458 --> 12:21.250
It was the last time
I saw my sister.

12:22.792 --> 12:24.792
Latrice walked you
to the bus stop.

12:24.875 --> 12:25.875
And that was around..

12:25.959 --> 12:27.458
...4:00 p.m.?

12:27.542 --> 12:28.875
Yes.

12:28.959 --> 12:32.041
You notice anyone suspicious
on the street there?

12:51.583 --> 12:55.375
She was always worried,
since the mugging.

12:55.458 --> 12:57.125
What mugging?

12:57.208 --> 12:59.750
A few months
before she disappeared.

12:59.834 --> 13:01.959
My sister was mugged.

13:03.417 --> 13:05.542
This happened in 2001?

13:05.625 --> 13:07.542
'We went to the police.'

13:07.625 --> 13:10.041
She identified him in a lineup.

13:10.125 --> 13:12.000
Still in prison.

13:13.625 --> 13:17.750
You last saw your daughter
Tina at around 4:00 p.m.?

13:19.291 --> 13:21.166
She was training.

13:21.250 --> 13:24.208
Headed out for an afternoon
cross-country run.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.291
She never came back.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.792
Was there a shortcut she'd take?

13:47.875 --> 13:50.458
Not after that
pervert jumped her.

13:50.542 --> 13:51.834
Tina was raped?

13:51.917 --> 13:53.417
'Attempted.'

13:53.500 --> 13:56.083
Two years before she..

13:56.166 --> 13:58.041
...disappeared.

13:58.125 --> 14:01.125
'I always taught her
to stand up for herself.'

14:01.208 --> 14:03.792
She sprayed
that rapist in the face.

14:03.875 --> 14:05.500
Pepper spray?

14:05.583 --> 14:06.917
Riot-control tear gas.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Knocks an elephant down
in two seconds flat.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.834
Used it in the marines.

14:11.917 --> 14:14.583
What happened to the guy
who tried to rape her?

14:14.667 --> 14:16.417
'Tear gas blinded
him for life.'

14:20.709 --> 14:23.417
Was Tina..

14:23.500 --> 14:25.917
...in pain when she..

14:27.792 --> 14:30.250
Did my girl
call out for me?

14:35.333 --> 14:38.709
(Scotty)
Janet, Tina, Latrice
all victims of a violent
crime

14:38.792 --> 14:40.083
before they go missing.

14:40.166 --> 14:43.166
Domestic assault,
robbery, attempted rape.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.959
Thing is, these doers
ain't our doer.

14:46.041 --> 14:47.750
They were either in lock
up or outta commission

14:47.834 --> 14:49.291
at the time
their victims went missing.

14:49.375 --> 14:51.291
Could be how our
guy's pickin' 'em.

14:51.375 --> 14:52.959
Reads about the
crimes in the
paper

14:53.041 --> 14:54.542
and hears about
them on the
radio.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.500
Picks the survivors.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.458
The coroners ID'd
the other bodies.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.083
Check their
histories
for prior crimes.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.959
Report control unit
will be open in the morning.

15:02.041 --> 15:03.458
Thought we'd check tonight.

15:03.542 --> 15:04.792
Report still open?

15:04.875 --> 15:05.959
Yeah.

15:09.917 --> 15:12.291
All nine of your girls got 49s.

15:12.375 --> 15:14.041
All victims of prior crimes.

15:14.125 --> 15:16.166
Carjacking, rape,
assault with a deadly weapon.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.333
'Runs the gamut.'

15:17.417 --> 15:18.917
Lucky they all survived.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.166
Not so lucky
if you think about it.

15:22.792 --> 15:24.417
After Leroy gets
through with Janet

15:24.500 --> 15:27.792
he starts in on the kid.
Janet clocks him in the
face.

15:27.875 --> 15:28.959
Right.

15:29.041 --> 15:31.834
And...Latrice Hicks,
who got mugged..

15:31.917 --> 15:35.083
...broke the guy's nose
when he went for her handbag.

15:35.166 --> 15:36.917
Like Tina James
with the tear gas.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.333
(Lilly)
'Yeah, they weren't
just victims of a crime..'

15:41.417 --> 15:43.500
...they all fought back.

15:43.583 --> 15:44.750
Huh.

15:44.834 --> 15:46.208
We'll need
any records on victims

15:46.291 --> 15:47.583
who did the same.

15:47.667 --> 15:48.667
Uh, might
take
a few hours.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.166
We're not computerized.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.125
Well, we'll pick 'em up
in the morning.

15:56.333 --> 15:57.417
You taking the train?

15:57.500 --> 15:58.583
I'll walk you.

16:00.542 --> 16:01.792
I gotta go
somewhere
first.

16:05.583 --> 16:06.834
Well, be careful.

16:12.834 --> 16:15.083
(Lilly)
'Classy joint.'

16:16.166 --> 16:17.458
Classy girl.

16:20.792 --> 16:22.542
You here to drink?

16:22.625 --> 16:23.792
Or bitch?

16:25.125 --> 16:28.542
Give me a vodka orange.
Hold the vodka.

16:29.542 --> 16:31.125
Never did take after mom.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.667
Where are you
staying these days?

16:35.750 --> 16:37.166
The Y.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.917
'There's a daybed downstairs.'

16:42.041 --> 16:44.875
Cats might fight
you for it, but..

16:46.000 --> 16:48.542
What changed your mind?

16:48.625 --> 16:50.667
You can't be wandering
around like some kinda--

16:50.750 --> 16:51.750
Some kinda what?

16:51.834 --> 16:53.250
You don't know what's out there.

16:53.333 --> 16:54.750
And you do?

16:54.834 --> 16:55.917
Wish I didn't..

16:57.333 --> 16:59.667
...sometimes.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.792
Just till I get
something permanent.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.125
(Frannie)
Autopsies showed
no evidence of rape

17:23.208 --> 17:25.667
or sexual trauma
in even the most recent
bodies.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.834
Well, then what's
he doing with 'em all night?

17:27.917 --> 17:29.667
Well, breaks and fractures
were apparent

17:29.750 --> 17:31.542
in most of the victims' feet.

17:31.625 --> 17:33.291
Multiple lacerations
on their soles.

17:33.375 --> 17:35.667
(Frannie)
'And on the fresher bodies,
torn ligaments.'

17:35.750 --> 17:36.959
Meaning?

17:37.041 --> 17:38.417
Types of injuries you
get running barefoot

17:38.500 --> 17:40.417
'over rough terrain
for several hours.'

17:40.500 --> 17:42.291
He's chasing them
through the woods?

17:42.375 --> 17:44.333
Looks like it, yeah.

17:44.417 --> 17:46.291
Ballistics in
on the bullet yet?

17:46.375 --> 17:48.083
Arisaka, model 38.

17:48.166 --> 17:50.208
Japanese bolt-action rifle.

17:50.291 --> 17:51.959
(Will)
'Imported after world war
II.'

17:52.041 --> 17:54.250
Can't be many places
that sell that ammo.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.500
(Lilly)
'Only one in the city'

17:55.583 --> 17:59.000
is an army surplus store
on the boulevard.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.291
Let's go.

18:01.375 --> 18:03.959
Guy orders the same
kinda ammo every year.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.542
We got a name, Will.

18:05.625 --> 18:06.750
Peter Brodsky.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.500
- Check his ID?
- Hell, yeah.

18:09.583 --> 18:11.583
Last thing
I need is to lose my license.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.041
(Lilly)
Ordered the same thing.

18:13.125 --> 18:16.291
Year after year, except in 1999.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.333
Same year Tina James
goes missing.

18:18.417 --> 18:20.375
In 1999 he also ordered

18:20.458 --> 18:24.000
a "military m-95
with CP filter."

18:24.083 --> 18:25.083
What's that?

18:25.166 --> 18:26.333
Gas mask.

18:26.417 --> 18:27.333
What?

18:27.417 --> 18:28.750
(male #2)
'Special issue.'

18:28.834 --> 18:30.750
Used for riot control.

18:30.834 --> 18:32.083
Filters out tear gas.

18:32.166 --> 18:34.291
How'd he know Tina
carried tear gas?

18:34.375 --> 18:36.333
You ever see this
guy, Peter Brodsky?

18:36.417 --> 18:37.542
Couldn't tell you
what he looked like

18:37.625 --> 18:40.291
if you had ATF
breaking down the door.

18:40.375 --> 18:41.500
What do you mean?

18:41.583 --> 18:44.667
The guy was like...not there.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.375
You know what I mean?

18:48.166 --> 18:51.000
(male #2)
'Got your ammo
and the gas mask.'

18:51.083 --> 18:52.166
'Y2k, huh?'

18:55.625 --> 18:57.083
Receipt's in there, too.

18:57.166 --> 18:58.875
Damn government taxes.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.375
How much?

19:05.458 --> 19:07.333
Take all you want, buddy.

19:07.417 --> 19:09.166
On me.

19:24.959 --> 19:27.875
Like I said...not there.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.208
And you couldn't ID him?

19:30.291 --> 19:31.917
Sorry.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.166
He stopped to look
at something.

19:37.417 --> 19:38.917
That it?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.709
Yeah, that's been up there
since I opened the store.

19:41.792 --> 19:43.166
What is it?

19:43.250 --> 19:44.291
(male #2)
'Orion.'

19:44.375 --> 19:46.458
(Will)
'The constellation.'

19:46.542 --> 19:48.250
'Clears the horizon
for the first time'

19:48.333 --> 19:50.125
ever year...in November.

19:50.208 --> 19:52.583
Same month he killed.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.375
Orion comes from the Greek myth.

19:55.417 --> 19:57.333
Means "great hunter."

19:59.166 --> 20:01.792
That's why he makes them run.

20:01.875 --> 20:03.583
He's hunting them.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.291
He hunts them
for hours in the woods.

20:11.375 --> 20:13.125
Shoots 'em before dawn.

20:13.208 --> 20:14.208
Takes their heads.

20:14.291 --> 20:15.667
He's a hunter.

20:15.750 --> 20:17.500
Targeting human prey.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.458
(Scotty)
'And now we got a name.'

20:19.542 --> 20:20.959
Peter Brodsky.

20:21.041 --> 20:22.625
What I don't get is,
how he picks them up.

20:22.709 --> 20:24.458
Broad daylight, public places.

20:24.542 --> 20:26.291
We know all
these women are fighters.

20:26.375 --> 20:28.500
But no one ever sees
or hears a thing.

20:28.583 --> 20:30.125
So maybe they go
with him willingly

20:30.208 --> 20:31.959
'cause they know him. Trust him.

20:32.041 --> 20:34.125
You trust family, friends.

20:34.208 --> 20:36.041
A cop.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.625
Peter Brodsky.

20:37.709 --> 20:40.250
Worked northeast
division. A
uniform.

20:40.333 --> 20:41.834
(Nick)
'Left the job in '84'

20:41.917 --> 20:44.125
'drops off
the face of the earth.'

20:44.208 --> 20:45.834
Guy's nowhere in the system now.

20:47.625 --> 20:48.792
Alright, let's
check for reports

20:48.875 --> 20:51.792
of suspicious
police behavior '84-2002

20:51.875 --> 20:54.333
and Brodsky's IAB file.

20:56.417 --> 20:58.667
Our victims were
abducted during the day

20:58.750 --> 21:00.166
'before sunset, right?'

21:00.250 --> 21:02.959
All but Janet Lambert.
She was picked up at
night.

21:03.041 --> 21:04.834
Well, maybe he tried
getting her earlier.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.208
Janet had her kid
with her all day.

21:08.291 --> 21:11.083
So maybe Susan
saw something at sunset.

21:12.750 --> 21:15.166
We were in
the car. Driving.

21:15.250 --> 21:17.500
Well, you remember seeing a cop?

21:17.583 --> 21:19.834
Yes, I do.

21:19.917 --> 21:22.041
We had left the police
station
a few hours earlier

21:22.125 --> 21:24.125
after my mom filed the report.

21:24.208 --> 21:25.709
She was late for work.

21:25.792 --> 21:27.500
Then what happened?

21:27.583 --> 21:31.709
We weren't even speeding, but
then this cop pulls us over..

21:35.417 --> 21:39.041
(Janet)
'What did I do?'

21:39.125 --> 21:40.500
I know why you're mad at me.

21:40.583 --> 21:41.750
I'm not mad.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.959
Because of what
your daddy did today.

21:45.375 --> 21:47.542
He does that every day, mommy.

21:48.625 --> 21:49.792
He won't.

21:50.625 --> 21:54.208
'Not no more. I promise.'

21:54.291 --> 21:57.792
I'm not breaking any more
promises, not to you, Susan.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.792
Officer?
I don't think, I was speeding.

22:04.875 --> 22:06.542
What's she doing here?

22:06.625 --> 22:07.709
Excuse me?

22:07.792 --> 22:09.250
No speeding.
You got your warning.

22:21.208 --> 22:25.083
You think a cop had something
to do with my
mother's...murder?

22:26.375 --> 22:27.542
We don't know yet.

22:27.625 --> 22:29.792
You think you
could ID him, Susan?

22:29.875 --> 22:33.083
I barely saw him.
I'm sorry.

22:37.458 --> 22:39.917
(Lilly)
'It wasn't your fault..'

22:40.000 --> 22:42.875
...what happened to your mom.

22:42.959 --> 22:46.083
If I could have
that moment back?

22:46.166 --> 22:48.041
I would have told her.

22:48.125 --> 22:49.375
What?

22:52.709 --> 22:54.500
That I loved her, too.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.625
(Scotty)
'Lil.'

22:58.709 --> 23:00.667
Got something.

23:00.750 --> 23:02.125
I'm sorry.

23:04.709 --> 23:06.041
Boys found a live one.

23:06.125 --> 23:08.959
Woman who reported
a cop abduction in '97.

23:09.041 --> 23:10.333
A survivor?

23:14.917 --> 23:16.333
(female #1)
'He brought me here.'

23:18.667 --> 23:20.709
Yeah.

23:22.375 --> 23:23.959
'Help me!'

23:24.041 --> 23:26.458
I was, uh...working
at the bar that night

23:26.542 --> 23:27.625
you know,
doing a little..

23:29.041 --> 23:32.333
...in the parking lot,
when this cop rolled up

23:32.417 --> 23:36.041
said he was bringing me in
for disorderly conduct.

23:36.125 --> 23:37.583
Did you get a look at him?

23:39.291 --> 23:40.709
I was wasted.

23:40.792 --> 23:43.208
Could've been Mickey Mouse
and I wouldn't have known.

23:44.583 --> 23:48.333
Got his name, though.
Brodsky something.

23:50.875 --> 23:52.792
(female #1)
'Lot of good it did.'

23:52.875 --> 23:56.000
Cops looked at me like
I was making it up.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.875
They filed a report.

23:57.959 --> 24:01.166
They didn't do nothing
with it, did they?

24:01.250 --> 24:05.333
This cop, Brodsky, gets
you in the car. Then what?

24:05.417 --> 24:10.000
He starts driving and
driving...then he stops.

24:24.333 --> 24:27.250
Get out.

24:27.333 --> 24:28.917
I didn't see your face, officer.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.458
I can't ID you.

24:32.125 --> 24:34.250
We can do it in the
back seat. Any way you want.

24:34.333 --> 24:35.917
I'm real good,
I'll be real good.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.750
Just don't hurt me, please.

24:39.834 --> 24:42.625
Don't act dumb
like an animal.

24:43.875 --> 24:46.166
Don't. Please.

24:46.250 --> 24:47.875
"Don't" and "please."

24:47.959 --> 24:50.041
(Peter)
They always say
those words.

24:50.125 --> 24:54.542
Ready to run, Atalanta?

24:54.625 --> 24:57.583
What did you call me?

25:00.125 --> 25:01.375
(screaming)
'Help!'

25:01.458 --> 25:04.792
(screaming)
Help!

25:12.417 --> 25:14.959
(Will)
'What's Atalanta?'

25:15.041 --> 25:17.917
Princess Atalanta.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.750
A story I heard as a kid.

25:20.834 --> 25:23.834
'See, a few years ago,
when I almost got raped'

25:23.917 --> 25:25.917
I couldn't do nothing.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.083
I just lay there..

25:28.166 --> 25:31.250
...waiting to die.

25:31.333 --> 25:34.000
Then I remembered Atalanta

25:34.083 --> 25:36.959
the princess who was
the fastest in the land.

25:37.041 --> 25:41.750
Gave me the strength
to run away remembering that.

25:41.834 --> 25:44.125
Did you tell anybody
else about that?

25:45.917 --> 25:49.709
No one. Just me and God.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.667
How could he know?

25:57.417 --> 26:01.000
(Scotty)
Found Peter Brodsky
in Butte, Montana.

26:01.083 --> 26:03.166
Hasn't been in
Philly for 20
years.

26:04.375 --> 26:05.625
We sure?

26:05.709 --> 26:07.458
Him and his wife,
left town for good in
'84.

26:07.542 --> 26:09.000
He was shot on the job.

26:09.083 --> 26:10.625
Been in a wheelchair since.

26:10.709 --> 26:13.125
So someone knew Brodsky
was out of commission.

26:13.208 --> 26:15.291
And stole his identity.

26:15.375 --> 26:17.959
Well, he knew these women
were victimized before

26:18.041 --> 26:19.667
that they all fought back.

26:19.750 --> 26:21.625
And how they
defended themselves.

26:21.709 --> 26:23.542
Tina James with tear gas.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.500
Other people could've
known.
Her old man knew.

26:25.583 --> 26:28.542
But he knew the song, Scotty,
and what it meant to Janet.

26:28.625 --> 26:30.542
She told the cops
about the song.

26:30.625 --> 26:33.917
But Atalanta?
How'd he know about that?

26:34.000 --> 26:35.667
(Lilly)
'Well, he knows about the
song'

26:35.750 --> 26:39.667
and the tear gas
and the childhood story

26:39.750 --> 26:42.291
'cause it's in the report.

26:43.875 --> 26:45.542
He's reading these reports.

26:45.625 --> 26:47.500
Well, let's say
he ain't a cop.

26:47.583 --> 26:48.834
But he's got access.

26:48.917 --> 26:50.375
Who else would have access

26:50.458 --> 26:52.417
to the reports
to a cop's identity?

27:02.500 --> 27:06.500
I appreciate you
coming up here, George.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.875
We're hoping you can help us.

27:08.959 --> 27:12.500
You see, we're looking
for fresh eyes on this
thing.

27:12.583 --> 27:14.166
Wow.

27:14.250 --> 27:16.792
Uh, sure. Fire away.

27:16.875 --> 27:19.041
Who could've read
all these reports?

27:19.125 --> 27:21.250
I mean, you see
that back and forth

27:21.333 --> 27:23.000
who has access to all that?

27:23.083 --> 27:26.792
Well, I'm the gatekeeper
everyone goes through me.

27:26.875 --> 27:29.041
So you're the only one
who has access to the 49s?

27:29.125 --> 27:30.792
And I run a tight ship.

27:32.792 --> 27:35.792
What stumps me,
is the women he picks.

27:35.875 --> 27:37.208
Fighters.

27:37.291 --> 27:39.750
Most of us, we already
got the ball and chain.

27:41.625 --> 27:43.583
(George)
'Well, it might
be different if, uh..'

27:43.667 --> 27:44.834
...you were looking
to kill her.

27:44.917 --> 27:46.458
That so?

27:46.542 --> 27:48.875
He hates women.
Because of his mother.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.750
Who was, uh, domineering,
controlling, serial killer
101.

27:53.834 --> 27:57.917
- You read a lot, huh, George?
- It's what I do.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.542
You spend a lot of time,
with those records

27:59.625 --> 28:01.291
'reading about our dead women.'

28:01.375 --> 28:04.750
Yeah, it's better
than fiction, right?

28:04.834 --> 28:07.750
- How so?
- No one reads 'em.

28:07.834 --> 28:09.583
No one cares about 'em..

28:10.583 --> 28:11.875
...but me.

28:13.750 --> 28:15.625
(George)
'Oh, by the way..'

28:17.375 --> 28:19.625
...you're not gonna
find anything in my house.

28:34.041 --> 28:35.250
Not a hair out of place.

28:35.333 --> 28:37.041
No dirty dishes.

28:37.125 --> 28:38.583
No stained laundry, nothing.

28:38.667 --> 28:41.417
Now, he had to wash
the blood off somewhere.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.417
CSU's pulling the drains now.

28:43.500 --> 28:44.959
They're dusting his
clothes for prints.

28:45.041 --> 28:48.291
If our victims fought
back,
maybe we'll get lucky.

28:48.375 --> 28:50.959
I'm not even getting dust here.

28:51.041 --> 28:52.125
Do you hunt, Nick?

28:52.208 --> 28:56.041
- Yeah 'course.
- 'Look at this.'

29:16.834 --> 29:19.583
Found your boots, George.

29:19.667 --> 29:22.709
Lot of blood,
taking off a
head.

29:22.792 --> 29:24.166
Tough to wash out.

29:24.250 --> 29:27.125
[scoffs]
But...not impossible.

29:28.917 --> 29:31.834
We're just talking here, right?

29:31.917 --> 29:34.792
Right. Just talking.

29:34.875 --> 29:37.125
(George)
'And I'm free to walk out..'

29:37.208 --> 29:39.500
...anytime I want.

29:39.583 --> 29:43.250
Most people think
they have to stay, talk.

29:43.333 --> 29:45.333
(George)
'Dumb civilians.'

29:45.417 --> 29:47.625
Not you, though.

29:49.959 --> 29:52.458
What are your thoughts
on this guy, George?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.542
I mean, why did he take
their clothes off?

29:55.625 --> 29:58.083
(John)
'He's not raping them.'

29:58.166 --> 29:59.333
'What's the point?'

29:59.417 --> 30:01.250
Hmm.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.250
Good question. Uh..

30:04.333 --> 30:06.041
Control?

30:06.125 --> 30:07.417
Humiliation?

30:09.792 --> 30:11.375
The way their teats
pucker in the cold?

30:14.375 --> 30:16.125
(John)
'It's tough, getting
a woman's clothes off'

30:16.208 --> 30:17.792
when she's not willing.

30:17.875 --> 30:22.041
Must've been scratching,
kicking, fighting.

30:22.125 --> 30:25.083
They fight
you a lot, George?

30:37.834 --> 30:40.750
Statistically speaking,
victims rarely fight back

30:40.834 --> 30:43.417
when a firearm is used
in the commission of a crime.

30:44.750 --> 30:47.458
<i>him.</i>

30:47.542 --> 30:50.500
Well, like we said,
just theorizing.

30:50.583 --> 30:51.667
Hypothesizing.

30:51.750 --> 30:54.250
We appreciate
your insight, George.

30:54.333 --> 30:55.458
Any time.

30:55.542 --> 30:58.208
(Scotty)
'So, why do you think..'

30:58.291 --> 31:00.417
...he picks survivors?

31:00.500 --> 31:01.959
Wants a challenge.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.583
That's obvious.

31:05.667 --> 31:07.000
Once he finally,
tracks them down

31:07.083 --> 31:09.166
I bet they're not
so uppity anymore, huh?

31:09.250 --> 31:11.750
(Scotty)
'And then he teaches
them a lesson.'

31:11.834 --> 31:14.417
Oh, I imagine there are
many lessons taught..

31:15.959 --> 31:17.667
...in the woods.

31:19.542 --> 31:21.208
(Scotty)
'You know what I think?'

31:21.291 --> 31:23.959
This guy..

31:24.041 --> 31:25.709
...never got laid
once in his life.

31:28.208 --> 31:30.625
(Scotty)
'Cause it-it, you know,
it sounds to me like'

31:30.709 --> 31:34.166
he's got a real problem
with the ladies. You know?

31:36.333 --> 31:38.458
You're the one
with the lady problem..

31:38.542 --> 31:40.041
'...from what I hear.'

31:42.208 --> 31:44.375
Nothing that a little
Thorazine can't fix.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.542
- Don't you talk about her.
- Scotty.

31:48.625 --> 31:49.792
You know what I mean,
lieutenant.

31:49.875 --> 31:52.709
Got a few lady problems
of your own.

31:52.792 --> 31:54.125
Is that right?

31:54.208 --> 31:56.083
Ex-wife who hasn't spoken
to you in ten years.

31:56.166 --> 31:59.750
Daughter who only
pretends to love her daddy.

32:01.500 --> 32:02.625
Those second-rate medals

32:02.709 --> 32:05.041
hanging in
your second-rate office.

32:05.125 --> 32:07.000
(George)
'Were they really worth it?'

32:08.917 --> 32:12.083
Like I said,
I can stop talking.

32:13.875 --> 32:15.250
And I'm done talking to you.

32:19.083 --> 32:21.375
(Nick)
'Saw your place, George.

32:21.458 --> 32:23.000
You're a hell of a neat freak.

32:23.083 --> 32:24.333
(Will)
'How's such a tidy guy'

32:24.417 --> 32:26.583
do the messy business
of taking off heads there?

32:28.250 --> 32:29.834
I didn't take off anyone's head.

32:29.917 --> 32:32.792
I meant animal heads, George.

32:32.875 --> 32:34.792
(Will)
'You hunt, don't you?

32:36.625 --> 32:39.583
Chasing dumb animals
in the woods..

32:39.667 --> 32:40.917
...no challenge.

32:41.041 --> 32:44.250
You like a challenge, George?

32:44.333 --> 32:46.041
I bore easily.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.166
So if our killer
wants a challenge

32:51.250 --> 32:53.709
why hunt women, why not men?

32:53.792 --> 32:54.917
(Will)
'An NBA player'

32:55.000 --> 32:57.500
Olympic athlete,
guy at the gym.

32:57.583 --> 33:00.208
(Nick)
'Why does he always, go
for the doe, the weaker sex?'

33:00.291 --> 33:01.625
'Why is that?'

33:01.709 --> 33:04.417
Well, maybe those females
had more to live for.

33:04.500 --> 33:06.041
(George)
'Like the ones with children
put up a real squall.'

33:06.125 --> 33:07.667
I bet if he
promised
to bring their

33:07.750 --> 33:11.125
little ones into
the woods, too. Hmm.

33:11.208 --> 33:12.750
Some hunter.

33:12.834 --> 33:16.375
(Nick)
'Taking down children, women.

33:16.458 --> 33:18.583
Plus he let one get away.

33:19.959 --> 33:22.291
What, you mean the drunk?

33:22.375 --> 33:25.291
Or is she a full-blown
addict by now?

33:25.375 --> 33:27.500
How'd you know
who we're talking about?

33:27.583 --> 33:28.834
I've read her reports.

33:28.917 --> 33:30.959
No DA would ever
put her on the stand.

33:31.041 --> 33:32.875
Sloppy police work.

33:32.959 --> 33:35.792
Kite will be
disappointed...again.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.834
(George)
'Another bungled lead.'

33:39.917 --> 33:43.583
- Kinda like the Chimayo case.
- What's that?

33:43.667 --> 33:44.834
Oh, I read those
files, too, Nick.

33:44.917 --> 33:46.250
You screwed the pooch

33:46.333 --> 33:48.834
big time...or rather

33:48.917 --> 33:52.208
someone screwed a lot
of juicy pooches because of
you.

33:52.291 --> 33:53.750
That's it. Come on, get up.

33:53.834 --> 33:55.250
- Hey, hey, Nick, Nick!
- Come on. Get him up!

33:55.333 --> 33:56.542
Come on. Come on.

33:56.625 --> 34:00.041
Fine line between
being human and an animal.

34:00.125 --> 34:03.000
(George)
'Look at you.'

34:03.083 --> 34:06.667
So, tell me about
those dumb animals, George.

34:06.750 --> 34:09.458
I once read a pursued animal
will run on broken toes

34:09.542 --> 34:12.417
fractured shins,
bloody stumps of feet.

34:14.625 --> 34:17.500
There are worse things
than rape, Nick.

34:17.583 --> 34:19.709
Things that go on for hours.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.291
I want my daddy.

34:31.041 --> 34:32.291
Daddy.

34:34.959 --> 34:38.291
Hypothetically speaking,
of course.

34:38.375 --> 34:41.333
She was just a little girl.

34:41.417 --> 34:44.333
Oh, I imagine
at the end she
wasn't.

34:44.417 --> 34:47.667
The things a female
will beg to do

34:47.750 --> 34:50.125
if only you'll let her live.

34:51.792 --> 34:54.000
Ever wonder what,
Mrs. Jeffries begged for

34:54.083 --> 34:56.125
on that lonely highway
before she died?

34:58.083 --> 34:59.792
Not gonna work, George.

34:59.875 --> 35:01.667
Sorry.

35:01.750 --> 35:03.375
Because I know.

35:07.709 --> 35:10.250
Don't forget your deer eye.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.208
Deer eye, George?

35:13.291 --> 35:15.458
You, uh, a taxidermist?

35:20.250 --> 35:22.000
Done talking to you.

35:22.083 --> 35:24.875
'Cause if you never hunted..

35:24.959 --> 35:26.792
...why do you have
these at your place?

35:29.375 --> 35:31.458
Done talking.

35:33.625 --> 35:35.750
I want the blonde.

35:39.166 --> 35:40.208
All we need is
one admission

35:40.291 --> 35:41.709
just one slip-up.

35:41.792 --> 35:43.917
Get him to say
he was there.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.542
(Scotty)
'Results are back from the
lab.'

35:46.625 --> 35:48.709
On his boots..

35:48.792 --> 35:50.583
...no blood residue.

35:50.667 --> 35:52.375
Nothing.

35:52.458 --> 35:54.500
(Scotty)
'Ditto on the house,
drains are clean.'

35:54.583 --> 35:57.291
No hair, no trace evidence.

35:57.375 --> 36:00.500
Couldn't even lift
George's prints.

36:00.583 --> 36:02.625
This guy wipes down
his own house?

36:04.458 --> 36:06.250
I'm going out for coffee.

36:06.333 --> 36:07.625
You okay?

36:18.500 --> 36:20.250
Put him in those woods, Lil.

36:22.625 --> 36:26.250
(Lilly)
'Like being
in this room, George?'

36:26.333 --> 36:29.750
Playing games...excites you?

36:31.834 --> 36:34.166
I've watched you here.

36:34.250 --> 36:35.709
Upon occasion.

36:37.750 --> 36:40.041
Really?

36:40.125 --> 36:41.375
Really.

36:44.834 --> 36:47.250
So, you snuck into observation?

36:48.959 --> 36:50.750
Groped your ding-a-ling
in the dark?

36:50.834 --> 36:53.667
Wouldn't flatter myself
if I were you.

36:53.750 --> 36:56.458
That thing only
work in the woods?

36:56.542 --> 36:57.750
Or maybe not even there?

36:57.834 --> 37:00.125
Yet another tired-assed
Lilly trick.

37:00.208 --> 37:02.959
Seen it before,
seen it before. Yawn.

37:03.041 --> 37:05.625
Ah, ah, we're
just warming up.

37:05.709 --> 37:08.792
- Ooh, show and tell.
- That's right.

37:08.875 --> 37:12.709
Then let me tell you
something about Lilly Rush.

37:12.792 --> 37:14.583
Hmm.

37:14.667 --> 37:16.667
Why you really became a cop.

37:17.750 --> 37:19.125
'What you've
never told a soul'

37:19.208 --> 37:23.041
the bad thing that
happened to little Lilly..

37:23.125 --> 37:25.667
'...long, long ago.'

37:25.750 --> 37:27.792
Hmm.

37:27.875 --> 37:29.667
I read your 49.

37:33.667 --> 37:35.667
Did you?

37:35.750 --> 37:38.834
You ever dream about it, Lilly?

37:39.834 --> 37:41.583
No. No, I don't.

37:41.667 --> 37:43.333
(George)
'Uh-huh.'

37:43.417 --> 37:45.166
Keep telling yourself that.

37:47.291 --> 37:49.041
Know your enemy.

37:50.667 --> 37:52.291
You've done your homework.

37:54.291 --> 37:56.041
So have I.

38:03.208 --> 38:08.000
Age 18, failed
the police academy entry
exam.

38:08.083 --> 38:11.917
Age 20, you failed
the physical for a,
uh

38:12.000 --> 38:14.041
shopping mall
security guard?

38:15.583 --> 38:18.875
(Lilly)
'Couldn't even make
it as a rent-a-cop.'

38:18.959 --> 38:25.417
So, here you are, 45,
filing away pieces of
paper.

38:25.500 --> 38:28.709
(Lilly)
'No wonder you like
to play dress up.'

38:28.792 --> 38:32.375
Now, you wanna
walk, be my
guest.

38:32.458 --> 38:33.959
I'm done with you.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.291
Oh, uh, one more thing.

38:40.291 --> 38:43.000
'Age 12..'

38:43.083 --> 38:44.959
...your mother's murdered.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.125
What could she have done to you?

38:55.083 --> 38:58.125
Ever dream about it, George?

39:02.667 --> 39:07.083
No wonder you're
such a small, little man.

39:07.166 --> 39:10.083
Don't you walk away from me.
Don't you walk away from me!

39:14.458 --> 39:16.834
there

39:16.917 --> 39:18.750
Where?

39:18.834 --> 39:21.000
In the woods?

39:21.083 --> 39:25.250
Tell me...who you are
in the woods.

39:25.333 --> 39:26.417
He's..

39:26.500 --> 39:27.583
(Lilly)
'You!'

39:27.667 --> 39:29.667
you

39:29.750 --> 39:31.000
Tell me!

39:32.291 --> 39:33.542
God.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.250
No, no. Please, don't. Please!

39:47.333 --> 39:52.375
I have a daughter and I can't
break any more promises to her

39:52.458 --> 39:55.625
'because she doesn't
have nobody.'

39:55.709 --> 39:58.542
Nobody in this
world but me.

40:08.250 --> 40:10.250
I love you, little girl.

40:17.709 --> 40:21.166
- I'm done with you.
- Tell me how you killed her.

40:22.959 --> 40:25.625
I gave you my thoughts,
my conjecture.

40:25.709 --> 40:28.500
- We were just talking, right?
- What did you do with her
head?

40:28.583 --> 40:30.000
he

40:30.083 --> 40:32.125
Where did you
put them, George?

40:32.208 --> 40:35.000
Ask him. I have no idea.
It's over.

40:35.083 --> 40:37.417
No, it's not
over,
so sit down!

40:37.500 --> 40:39.333
Oh, no.

40:39.417 --> 40:41.083
is

40:48.917 --> 40:50.500
Wait, he's just gonna walk?

40:50.583 --> 40:52.208
No confession.

40:52.291 --> 40:53.750
She was close.

40:56.917 --> 40:59.000
I'll be watching you.

41:03.959 --> 41:06.000
Think I might leave town.

41:06.083 --> 41:07.834
Do some traveling.

41:07.917 --> 41:12.333
(George)
'Beautiful country we live
in,
lots of empty woods'

41:13.333 --> 41:14.750
You ever hunt?

41:17.000 --> 41:18.709
No.

41:18.792 --> 41:21.625
We should do it sometime.

41:21.709 --> 41:24.417
Together.

41:24.500 --> 41:26.125
Maybe we will.
