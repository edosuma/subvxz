WEBVTT

00:03.462 --> 00:05.672
Oh, I'm finally here.

00:05.756 --> 00:08.258
Oh, this has been my dream
ever since I saw <i>An American in Paris.</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:11.220
For me, it was <i>Amélie.</i>
I made my mom give me that haircut.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.971
Happy Valentine's Day, <i>mon chéri.</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:15.140
Ah, <i>gay Paris.</i>

00:15.224 --> 00:17.768
- See, I told you it would be Claire.
- I had my money on Jay.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.978
Sorry, ladies. I'm in too good a mood.

00:20.062 --> 00:22.981
It's no big deal that I'm getting
a lifetime achievement award

00:23.065 --> 00:26.401
at this year's
Expo Internationale du Closet.

00:26.944 --> 00:31.240
Why don't they translate the last word?
I'm sure they have a word for closet.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.159
They're French. Maybe they went on strike
before they got to the end.

00:34.660 --> 00:38.830
<i>Monsieur</i> Pritchett,
welcome to the Crowne Plaza.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.624
I am Bernard Busse,

00:40.624 --> 00:43.252
President of the
International Closet Guild.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.464
Oh, God, he made the sound.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.551
And this woman needs no introduction.

00:51.677 --> 00:54.972
You are just as beautiful
as Jay described in his email.

00:54.972 --> 00:57.432
It's a pleasure to meet you, Stella.

00:57.516 --> 00:59.685
Oh, no, this is my wife, Gloria.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.937
Uh, I put you in the email,
but then it was too long.

01:02.312 --> 01:06.942
Well, I hope to see you both
at the cocktail reception in an hour.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.445
<i>Adiós!</i>

01:10.529 --> 01:12.364
'Cause that's what we need,
a third language.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.074
We have an hour. We should go sightseeing.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.158
Maybe check out Notre-Dame.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.785
No, thank you. I saw it back in the day

01:16.869 --> 01:18.287
before it was a shell of itself.

01:18.287 --> 01:20.080
Seeing it again will only depress me.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.208
Yeah, I know what you mean.
That's why I can't shop at Sears.

01:23.292 --> 01:27.087
Manny, why don't you go and check us in,
since you disgraced this family

01:27.171 --> 01:29.506
by learning French instead of Spanish.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.592
And get that room that they promised me.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.844
Apparently, some earl once slept there.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.304
We're so proud of you, Dad.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.973
Thanks. I only wish my old man
could be here to see this.

01:37.973 --> 01:41.310
You know, it's funny.
He stormed the beaches of Normandy,

01:41.310 --> 01:44.104
and I'm getting a Closet award.
We keep topping each other.

01:44.188 --> 01:46.231
- Who knows what Joe will do?
- Damn.

01:46.565 --> 01:48.108
Hey, what are you doing now?

01:48.192 --> 01:50.027
Well, you know, it's Valentine's Day,

01:50.027 --> 01:52.863
so I think I'm gonna enjoy
the most romantic city in the world

01:52.863 --> 01:54.072
with my husband.

01:54.156 --> 01:55.490
- Hmm.
- Oh.

01:55.574 --> 01:56.658
Sorry.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.411
Phil can't come to Paris
because he has to work.

01:59.411 --> 02:03.999
It stinks, but I am still gonna have so
much fun visiting all my favorite places

02:03.999 --> 02:05.834
from the semester
I spent there in college.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.586
Real estate emergency. Um...

02:07.586 --> 02:10.547
Broker-client confidentiality
forbids me from discussing it.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.467
The stuff I've seen,
you do not want to know.

02:13.842 --> 02:14.968
Correct.

02:15.052 --> 02:18.847
Look, if you want, and you don't feel
too awkward about being a third wheel,

02:18.931 --> 02:21.433
- maybe...
- Ugh! Pity invite from Mitchell.

02:21.517 --> 02:23.769
How the tables have turned.

02:23.769 --> 02:24.853
No, <i>merci.</i>

02:24.937 --> 02:27.814
I'm gonna go find my favorite
café, have a glass of wine,

02:27.898 --> 02:30.275
- and try not to be sad that I'm all alone.
- Okay, great. Have fun.

02:30.359 --> 02:31.568
Bye.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.029
Ooh, la la.

02:47.626 --> 02:51.129
You know, I heard the bread here is
healthier than the kind we have back home.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.756
Well, how is that possible?
Bread is bread.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.968
You would think, but it's
actually the way that the grain is, um...

02:55.968 --> 02:58.762
No, no. It's the way that the oven...

02:58.846 --> 03:01.139
Okay. Look, I'm gonna
have a lot of bread while we're here.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.474
I need it to be okay.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.184
I am so sorry.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.896
I think I'm jet-lagged. You know what?
I might take a nap while you go out...

03:08.522 --> 03:09.565
And explore.

03:09.565 --> 03:10.691
Oh!

03:10.691 --> 03:12.943
What was that? Why did your bag honk?

03:12.943 --> 03:14.987
I think that was a phone.
You know, that's how they ring here.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.073
Will somebody answer that?
Hmm, hmm...

03:18.073 --> 03:19.157
Don't be mad.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.617
Fizbo.

03:20.909 --> 03:24.079
My sweaters were too bulky to
pack, but Fizbo made the cut.

03:24.079 --> 03:27.416
Oh, come on. You know it's always
been my dream to bring the magic of Fizbo

03:27.416 --> 03:28.750
to the streets of Paris.

03:28.834 --> 03:32.629
You're not jet-lagged. You were gonna
sneak out and go clown around.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.673
You know that's not how we say it.
It's "clown about."

03:34.673 --> 03:37.217
- I can't believe you lied to me.
- I can't believe I had to.

03:37.301 --> 03:39.845
You know, most clowns have
spouses that are supportive.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.514
I'm not convinced
most clowns have spouses.

03:45.350 --> 03:49.938
<i>Claire was about to meet
Clive Bixby's French cousin, Claude.</i>

03:50.272 --> 03:51.481
<i>The plan was simple enough.</i>

03:51.565 --> 03:55.194
All I did was create a fake work emergency
and wait for Claire at her favorite café.

03:56.195 --> 03:59.072
Welcome to France.
What is the purpose of your visit?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.409
Just answer the question, sir.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.453
Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, business.

04:05.537 --> 04:06.663
Of <i>l'amour.</i>

04:16.215 --> 04:18.842
It helps to add a little sugar, Claude.

04:19.218 --> 04:22.471
Oh. Thank you,
but this is, uh, not my real name.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.348
It's my romantic alter ego.

04:25.224 --> 04:28.018
- I'm surprising my wife.
- Not bad.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.354
- For an American.
- Oh, really? You can do better?

04:32.105 --> 04:35.817
Many years ago,
I met a woman in this very café.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.112
We had a brief, passionate affair.

04:39.571 --> 04:44.284
Spending our days exploring Paris
and our nights exploring each other.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.245
Hmm.

04:46.245 --> 04:50.123
I once took a woman
to both Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.292
In the same day.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.254
And the day we parted,

04:56.463 --> 05:00.300
we promised to meet here
on this Valentine's Day.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.595
To rekindle our love. But who knows?

05:04.346 --> 05:06.265
The chances of her even remembering...

05:09.309 --> 05:10.644
- Claire!
- Claire!

05:13.313 --> 05:14.439
Mmm.

05:15.816 --> 05:16.900
Hello.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.195
Oh. I'm so sorry.

05:20.279 --> 05:22.114
"Sorry"? How did you know I speak English?

05:22.781 --> 05:24.366
Have a nice visit.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.251
What are you looking for?
<i>Mona Lisa?</i> McDonald's?

05:34.376 --> 05:38.547
Both are that way. Heads up,
the portions here are normal size.

05:38.547 --> 05:41.091
How did you know I'm American?
Is my accent that bad?

05:44.052 --> 05:46.638
- We're dressed the same.
- There's no reason to attack me.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.566
- Hey, where's Jay?
- I think he's nervous.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.569
He has changed his outfit three times.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.614
If this is what it's like to be
married to me, it's no picnic.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.532
We have a problem. I have to
show you something. Come here.

06:06.867 --> 06:11.455
- Burl Saunders.
- Close. Earl Chambers.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.040
Jay isn't getting the award.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.501
He's accepting it on behalf
of his ex-partner, Earl.

06:15.501 --> 06:17.794
What? How?

06:17.878 --> 06:21.757
When the expo called, Manny talked to them
because he speaks French.

06:21.757 --> 06:23.884
At least, he thought he did.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.763
In my defense, the French word
for hotel room sounds a lot like chamber.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.642
They said
they're putting you up in the royal suite.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.268
It used to be some earl's chamber.

06:33.352 --> 06:36.355
That's closet people for you.
Class all the way.

06:36.355 --> 06:38.607
Ah! He's here. What do we do?

06:38.607 --> 06:40.400
Nothing. Tell him the truth.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.819
Jay's a grown man. He can handle it.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.198
Okay, but if he goes for
my throat, be ready to dial <i>neuf, un, un.</i>

06:46.198 --> 06:49.117
That language, it's like
a bunch of horses talking.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.956
Look at this place. Everybody's here.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.667
Heinrich Muler of Berlin Closet-stadt,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.420
Susan Sadaki from Tokyo Closets
and Canned Whale Meat.

07:00.504 --> 07:01.797
It's a regular who's who.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.966
Yeah, even when you say all their names.

07:03.966 --> 07:07.177
I gotta tell you, this award
couldn't have come at a better time.

07:07.261 --> 07:10.138
With my closet company gone,
sometimes it feels like

07:10.305 --> 07:12.391
I don't have anything to show
for a lifetime of work.

07:12.391 --> 07:15.060
Like it didn't matter.
But now I know it did.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.147
Yes. Wait here. I'll be right back.

07:21.149 --> 07:24.570
New plan. I'm getting him
out of here. Keeping him busy.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.738
You go and talk to the closet people.

07:26.822 --> 07:30.200
Make them give him an award.
Any kind of award.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.660
He won't know the difference.

07:31.660 --> 07:34.288
- How?
- Bribe them. Blackmail them.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.957
Seduce them. Have I taught you nothing?

07:39.710 --> 07:40.919
- Phil?
- Claire.

07:41.003 --> 07:42.004
Claire?

07:42.713 --> 07:45.340
Guy? Oh, my God, what are you doing here?

07:45.424 --> 07:46.675
Claire, you know this Guy?

07:46.675 --> 07:49.219
Well, um, I used to.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.889
What are you both doing here?

07:51.889 --> 07:54.266
I came to surprise you on Valentine's Day.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.768
You know the guy on the plane
with all the face bandages? That was me.

07:56.852 --> 07:57.936
Oh!

07:58.020 --> 08:01.857
Claire, do you not remember
asking me to meet you here, in this café,

08:01.857 --> 08:04.109
exactly 30 years after we parted?

08:04.359 --> 08:05.569
Vaguely.

08:05.861 --> 08:08.363
I was crazy to think this could work out.

08:08.447 --> 08:12.075
Of course, a woman as
magnificent as you is married.

08:13.869 --> 08:16.955
I don't want to interfere
with your day of romance.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.124
I will wander our old haunts alone,

08:19.208 --> 08:23.337
and return to my hotel
in the ghostly embrace of our memories.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.381
<i>- Adieu,</i> Claire.
- Okay, cool. Bye.

08:26.465 --> 08:27.716
Yeah.
Let's go.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.346
All right, big day, lots of plans.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.056
- Mmm-hmm.
- First things first.

08:34.723 --> 08:36.683
- Getting into character.
- Oh.

08:38.644 --> 08:41.063
Mustard magnate with a flair for...

08:41.188 --> 08:42.773
Phil... Claude,

08:42.773 --> 08:44.858
I love that you're doing all of this,

08:44.942 --> 08:48.654
but doesn't some tiny part of you
feel guilty for ditching Guy?

08:51.240 --> 08:54.243
I mean, he did wait for me for 30 years.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.994
We could invite him for a glass of wine.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.164
Fine. But I'm warning you.

08:59.248 --> 09:00.582
If he gets out of line,

09:00.666 --> 09:02.042
- Claude knows karate.
- Mmm.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.210
And Krav Maga.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.254
- He's Jewish on his mother's side.
- Mmm.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.048
Let's go this way to the museum.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.176
Are you sure? I think they're
expecting me back inside.

09:11.260 --> 09:15.806
Make them wait. Why do you think
the brides arrive after everyone else?

09:15.973 --> 09:18.183
- You're the bride.
- Yeah, I'm the bride.

09:18.267 --> 09:20.769
- All right, let's go...
- No, you know what? It's this side.

09:21.270 --> 09:24.481
Tomorrow...
- No, I'm sorry. It's this way.

09:25.107 --> 09:26.650
Are you kidding me?

09:26.650 --> 09:29.528
- What?
- How beautiful.

10:00.392 --> 10:04.188
Claire, remember that time when we snuck
into the cellar of that wine bar?

10:04.188 --> 10:07.107
Oh, God, we were so crazy and so young.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.568
Not anymore. What's that, Grandma?
She's a grandma now.

10:09.568 --> 10:10.861
Oh!

10:11.195 --> 10:14.781
There's nothing more beautiful than a life
creating life, which in turn...

10:14.865 --> 10:16.200
Creates more life.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.369
Well, uh, Claire and I should get going.

10:19.453 --> 10:22.581
I was hoping to get up to Sacré-Coeur
to get a view of the whole city.

10:22.581 --> 10:26.043
No need. I have
a rooftop garden suite at The Peninsula.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.419
It's the best view in town.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.254
How perfect is this?

10:29.338 --> 10:30.923
Frustratingly.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.051
All right. Here we go.

10:37.012 --> 10:38.013
Oh.

10:39.223 --> 10:41.642
In a few minutes,
I'm going to be performing in the square.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.734
What?
He is Fizbeau.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.444
Fizbeau, okay?

11:01.495 --> 11:04.456
Guy, the suite is so beautiful.

11:04.540 --> 11:08.377
I think the last time we were in Paris,
we had a franc between the two of us.

11:08.377 --> 11:10.462
Oh, God. Who's Frank?

11:11.088 --> 11:14.258
I've been lucky in business.
Less so in love.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.511
I guess it's turned me into a workaholic.

11:17.511 --> 11:20.430
I must be in the office
10, 12 hours a week.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.100
Shall we have some champagne?

11:23.225 --> 11:25.811
Um, no, thank you.
I'm not really in the mood for champagne.

11:25.811 --> 11:28.021
Lucky for us,
because there are only two glasses.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.690
Ah.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.608
Allow me to make a toast.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.486
To Phil.

11:34.570 --> 11:36.864
- Oh.
- For allowing me to spend a bit more time

11:36.864 --> 11:38.490
with the most generous lover I've ever...

11:38.574 --> 11:40.826
Okay. I see what you're doing here.

11:40.826 --> 11:43.745
The champagne,
the hotel suite, that carousel ride.

11:43.829 --> 11:46.790
You two stopped laughing
every time I circled around.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.792
I'm sorry, buddy,
but it's not gonna happen.

11:49.877 --> 11:54.173
Phil's right. I'm a married woman.
There will be no romance on this trip.

11:54.173 --> 11:56.466
I'm sorry. I've been a fool.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.386
I guess I let myself
indulge in the fantasy more than I should.

12:00.053 --> 12:05.017
Please, let us all pretend
this never happened.

12:05.601 --> 12:08.645
Wait. Was that Poulanc's misdirect?

12:09.104 --> 12:10.105
Indeed.

12:10.522 --> 12:11.523
Oh.

12:11.607 --> 12:14.026
- A fellow prestidigitator?
- Yes.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.239
- Your watch, sir.
- Looking for this?

12:19.323 --> 12:21.033
- What?
- Oh, no way.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.784
We should bounce.

12:22.868 --> 12:25.621
Tell me you're going to visit
Le Musée des Magiciens while you're here?

12:25.621 --> 12:27.456
The Museum of Magicians? I'm dying to go,

12:27.456 --> 12:30.876
but they're closed Fridays, Saturdays
and Sundays, and Mondays and Wednesdays.

12:30.876 --> 12:34.087
Not if you know the owner.
I can get us a private tour.

12:34.171 --> 12:37.466
Sweet. Claire, what do you say?
We can pretend to saw you in half.

12:37.466 --> 12:38.842
Or just do it.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.805
Hello. Hi. Excuse me.
Why are you dressed like that?

12:46.642 --> 12:48.310
Really? You're the <i>imposteur.</i>

12:48.560 --> 12:50.270
If that word means what I think it means.

12:50.354 --> 12:51.355
<i>He'd stolen Fizbo.</i>

12:51.355 --> 12:54.399
The whimsically mismatched plaids,
my trademark bold splash of pink.

12:54.483 --> 12:58.403
My blue lip! He'd clearly
seen one of my online clown tutorials.

12:58.487 --> 12:59.905
Hey, guys, Fizbo again.

12:59.905 --> 13:02.449
Just remember, when you're
applying your rouge to go easy.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.244
<i>You're an auguste clown,
not a tramp.</i>

13:05.244 --> 13:06.537
You know what? Give me the jacket.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.373
Should have seen that coming.

13:14.378 --> 13:15.462
<i>Touché, monsieur.</i>

13:15.546 --> 13:16.588
You know what? Give me my...

13:17.673 --> 13:18.882
<i>And that's</i><i>when it hit me.</i>

13:19.383 --> 13:20.676
Oh!

13:21.343 --> 13:24.429
<i>The Clowns of Europe.</i>
I got this when I was a teenager.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.431
It was my <i>Sgt. Pepper's.</i>

13:26.807 --> 13:31.061
Clown after clown,
pushing the envelope, including Fizbeau.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.855
B-E-A-U.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.566
Here I thought I'd come up
with the idea, but he was right.

13:35.566 --> 13:38.652
I was the <i>imposteur.</i> If that's the word.

13:38.652 --> 13:41.488
For my high school language requirement,
I took auction-calling.

13:44.783 --> 13:45.868
See?

13:45.868 --> 13:48.495
Isn't Napoleon's tomb spectacular?

13:48.745 --> 13:51.540
Just so you know, when I go,
I don't need all this.

13:53.584 --> 13:55.335
Look. That's Manny over there.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.546
No. I'll go get him.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.678
How did it go?
Are they giving Jay an award?

14:04.678 --> 14:07.431
No. They said it would set
a very dangerous precedent.

14:07.431 --> 14:08.682
And in perfect English.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.268
Turns out this whole
misunderstanding was completely avoidable.

14:11.268 --> 14:13.145
We need to figure out something.

14:13.145 --> 14:17.191
Jay can never find out
that Earl got an award instead of him.

14:19.151 --> 14:20.194
Wow.

14:20.194 --> 14:23.655
Look at this place.
The craftsmanship, the architecture.

14:23.739 --> 14:25.949
They say the domed ceiling
acts as a whisper chamber.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.659
What does "whisper chamber" mean?

14:28.160 --> 14:30.370
It means
I heard everything you just said.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.665
I have to turn my TV up to 40,
but that was loud and clear.

14:39.922 --> 14:40.923
Ah.

14:42.883 --> 14:43.926
Mmm-hmm. Hmm.

14:45.344 --> 14:46.428
Ah.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.306
<i>It was easy to fit in.</i>

14:49.306 --> 14:52.100
All I had to do was look good
and have a lot of attitude.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.144
Paris was just like one big gay bar.

14:54.353 --> 14:55.854
Ah.

15:03.487 --> 15:04.780
- Ah.
- Bon appétit.

15:17.251 --> 15:19.753
No, I can't do it. I'm not French.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.421
I'm not eating that.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.757
This scarf is driving me crazy.

15:26.385 --> 15:28.720
- Cheeseburger's that way.
- Cool. Thanks, man.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.057
Wow.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.768
It's amazing how much magic
they got out of those old wands.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.187
Today, magicians have it
so easy, you know.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.148
Oh, yeah. Well, this basically feels

15:40.232 --> 15:42.901
like a natural breaking point,
for me, at least,

15:42.985 --> 15:44.903
so Phil and I
should probably...

15:44.987 --> 15:46.071
- You know?
- If you must.

15:46.071 --> 15:49.283
But our tickets also get us
to Le Musée des Automates.

15:49.283 --> 15:53.328
They are like robots, but very primitive.
They basically do nothing.

15:53.412 --> 15:56.415
Um, like the one
I built out of old mufflers.

15:56.415 --> 15:58.750
- Can we, Claire?
- Oh, yes, can we, Claire?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.044
Excuse me.

16:01.545 --> 16:03.881
Hey, Gloria. What's up?
I have a problem.

16:03.881 --> 16:06.383
Yes, so do I. Apparently, I'm into nerds.

16:06.383 --> 16:09.636
It's Jay. He's not getting that award.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.264
<i>What?</i>
- It was some kind of mistake.

16:12.264 --> 16:14.474
He found out and now we can't find him.

16:14.558 --> 16:16.727
Oh, my God. Okay, I'll be right there.

16:16.727 --> 16:18.228
<i>Are you sure it's okay?</i>

16:18.520 --> 16:20.397
Uh, yeah. It's more than okay.

16:23.859 --> 16:24.902
Hey.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.071
Hey. How did you find me?

16:28.363 --> 16:30.282
Well, you're pretty easy to spot.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.409
I'm sorry I overreacted, okay?

16:32.910 --> 16:35.787
If you want to be Fizbo, be Fizbo.

16:35.871 --> 16:37.331
I can never be Fizbo again.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.501
- Fizbo is dead.
- Oh, you're a moving target.

16:40.501 --> 16:43.003
Look, I ran into the real Fizbo today,

16:43.003 --> 16:46.006
and he squirted me in the face with water,
and hit me in the head with a book.

16:46.006 --> 16:49.009
- What?
- See, here I thought I had created

16:49.009 --> 16:50.093
this special, unique thing,

16:50.177 --> 16:52.804
but I'm the one that's been
a fraud all this time.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.141
- I'm throwing the suit in the river.
- Wait.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.019
That's littering.
There's a trash can right over here.

16:59.478 --> 17:02.147
Wait. Look, I gotta say, I'm...

17:02.648 --> 17:04.608
I don't think you stole anything.

17:04.608 --> 17:05.734
What do you mean?

17:05.734 --> 17:08.028
Well, you said he hit you
in the head with a book.

17:08.487 --> 17:10.239
I thought Fizbo was all about joy.

17:10.239 --> 17:12.616
He is. He's the embodiment
of childlike innocence.

17:12.616 --> 17:13.909
Exactly.

17:13.909 --> 17:16.662
- Fizbo would never resort to violence.
- Mmm-mmm.

17:16.662 --> 17:19.957
- This guy doesn't sound like Fizbo to me.
- He sure looked like him.

17:19.957 --> 17:26.338
Fizbo's more than just a pair of big shoes
and an unsexy jacket. He's an idea.

17:26.672 --> 17:30.509
If I've learned anything today,
it's that clothes do not make the man,

17:30.509 --> 17:31.760
or the clown.

17:32.177 --> 17:34.763
And you are the real Fizbo.

17:34.847 --> 17:37.766
- You mean it?
- I know.

17:38.100 --> 17:41.395
Now, come on, let's enjoy Paris.
It's Valentine's Day.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.106
Come on.

17:44.106 --> 17:47.401
Where did you get this crazy getup?
People are gonna stare.

17:49.862 --> 17:53.115
So, what was your favorite part
of the robot museum?

17:53.115 --> 17:55.826
Oh, man. I can't decide. You go first.

17:55.993 --> 17:58.579
- No, you'll just copy me.
- I do that.

17:59.872 --> 18:02.374
Well, let's just say it at the same time.

18:02.666 --> 18:05.419
On three. One, two, three.

18:05.419 --> 18:07.129
- The mechanical monkey band.
- The mechanical monkey band.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.297
- Jinx.
- Jinx.

18:08.297 --> 18:09.840
I told you.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.092
Oh...

18:12.759 --> 18:14.386
Oh...

18:14.386 --> 18:17.681
Oh, my God, it's a painting of us.

18:21.894 --> 18:23.937
Is my hand on yours?

18:24.021 --> 18:26.648
Yeah, but I don't think we did that.

18:28.942 --> 18:32.487
Well, um, I better go find Claire.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.031
Of course, yes.

18:34.031 --> 18:35.741
Okay. Weird. I guess this is goodbye.

18:35.741 --> 18:38.285
- You should have this.
- Keep it.

18:39.494 --> 18:42.748
You'll give it to me
in 30 years. In our café.

18:43.332 --> 18:44.416
I'll be there.

18:46.835 --> 18:49.546
<i>Au revoir,</i> Guy.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.264
Hey. I talked to Gloria.

18:59.890 --> 19:01.225
Thought I might find you here.

19:02.017 --> 19:04.394
It's a shame. Notre-Dame.

19:05.771 --> 19:08.190
- The fire.
- Yeah.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.692
It used to be
so impressive back in its day.

19:11.401 --> 19:12.736
Still pretty impressive.

19:13.737 --> 19:15.405
Just a shell of its former self.

19:16.782 --> 19:18.325
Best days are behind it.

19:20.577 --> 19:21.954
It'll never be the same.

19:24.373 --> 19:28.043
It's taken some hits,
but it's still standing.

19:28.418 --> 19:32.172
And that's grit.
That's what inspires people.

19:33.048 --> 19:34.258
That's what inspires me.

19:35.676 --> 19:37.302
It's so embarrassing.

19:37.719 --> 19:41.139
The whole reason the family's here is
to see me get that damn award.

19:41.223 --> 19:44.852
Oh, Dad, you and I are the only ones
in this family who care about closets.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.813
We're here because we love you.

19:48.647 --> 19:50.983
Come on. Let's go
get ready for that dinner.

19:57.114 --> 20:00.784
<i>"Forty-five years
is a long time to spend</i><i>in one industry,</i>

20:01.076 --> 20:02.578
<i>"and I've accomplished a lot.</i>

20:03.078 --> 20:06.290
<i>"The whisper hinge

- Dad, that's so sweet.

- We love you, too.
- Love you, Jay.

Claire Pritchett?

20:36.737 --> 20:38.280
Jean-Luc?

20:40.616 --> 20:42.451
I had a lot of fun here in college.

20:43.118 --> 20:44.286
What are you doing here?
