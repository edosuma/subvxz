WEBVTT

00:09.801 --> 00:11.910
Hey, Shammy. 
Action's on you.

00:11.998 --> 00:13.442
You in or out?

00:14.640 --> 00:16.074
All right. I'm out.

00:16.295 --> 00:18.043
I fold.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.496
Fold 'em.

00:19.981 --> 00:21.480
Too rich for my blood.

00:21.784 --> 00:24.535
Well, if it's too rich for the
most baller chef on the island,

00:24.623 --> 00:25.871
it's too rich for me.

00:26.097 --> 00:27.676
<i>♪ You got to pick
yourself up... ♪</i>

00:27.764 --> 00:28.871
Yeah, I'm out.

00:30.377 --> 00:31.577
Me too.

00:31.885 --> 00:35.019
<i>♪ Ain't no shame,
so do your thing... ♪</i>

00:35.106 --> 00:37.848
Well, Kumu, looks like
it's just you and me.

00:37.935 --> 00:39.525
And y-you should
probably fold,

00:39.613 --> 00:41.939
because I have a
really good hand.

00:42.581 --> 00:46.558
Oh, Thomas. Your Jedi
mind tricks won't work on me.

00:47.713 --> 00:49.306
I like this.

00:49.887 --> 00:51.367
Poker night's the one time

00:51.455 --> 00:53.418
we can all have fun
and forget about our badges,

00:53.506 --> 00:55.912
choppers, bars and cases.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.840
However, poker and solving
cases do have a lot in common.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.887
There's a lot at stake,
you got to keep your cool

01:00.975 --> 01:02.777
in high-pressure situations,

01:02.865 --> 01:04.504
and as much skill as it takes,

01:04.611 --> 01:06.105
a little bit of luck
never hurts.

01:06.193 --> 01:07.238
I don't know.

01:07.326 --> 01:09.777
Thomas, I'm feeling pretty
good about your hand.

01:09.865 --> 01:11.355
I think you got this, bro.

01:11.443 --> 01:13.004
Hey, whose side
are you guys on?

01:13.092 --> 01:15.957
Well, u-uh, emotionally, yours,
but financially, his.

01:16.045 --> 01:17.980
He owes
Rick and TC money.

01:18.113 --> 01:20.213
To him, winning this hand's
their best chance

01:20.301 --> 01:22.409
- at getting some of it back.
- Magnum owes you guys money, too?

01:22.496 --> 01:23.691
I thought
I was the only one.

01:28.201 --> 01:29.271
Okay...

01:29.359 --> 01:32.287
For the record, I think Magnum
actually does have a good hand.

01:32.375 --> 01:33.767
I'm just saying...

01:34.075 --> 01:35.194
you should probably
fold them.

01:35.281 --> 01:38.022
<i>♪ You got to
know when to fold 'em ♪</i>

01:38.198 --> 01:41.701
- <i>♪ Know when to hold 'em.</i>
- That's exactly wrong.

01:41.789 --> 01:43.095
You switched up
the lyrics.

01:43.183 --> 01:44.577
That's probably why
you're terrible at poker.

01:44.664 --> 01:46.319
Okay, it doesn't matter
what order the lyrics are in.

01:46.406 --> 01:47.387
The-the concept
is the same.

01:47.475 --> 01:48.598
You have to know
when to hold them and when to

01:48.685 --> 01:50.935
- fold them. And multiple them.
- N-No. The concept

01:51.022 --> 01:52.473
is that you're, y-you know,

01:52.561 --> 01:54.548
butchering a classic
Kenny Rogers song.

01:54.635 --> 01:56.061
Cool it with the bickery.

01:56.149 --> 01:57.514
I've made a decision.

01:59.473 --> 02:00.764
I'll call.

02:00.852 --> 02:01.853
- Oh!
- Ooh.  - Ooh.

02:02.077 --> 02:04.036
Oh...

02:04.130 --> 02:06.479
Very bold, Kumu.

02:06.567 --> 02:08.584
The only problem
is, I...

02:08.672 --> 02:10.734
flopped a straight.

02:10.954 --> 02:12.180
- Oh!
- Oh!

02:12.306 --> 02:13.696
Of course you did.

02:16.029 --> 02:17.223
That's a great hand.

02:17.310 --> 02:18.398
Mm-hmm.

02:18.485 --> 02:19.748
But I'm pretty sure

02:19.836 --> 02:22.053
a flush beats a straight.

02:22.141 --> 02:23.316
Oh, come on!

02:23.446 --> 02:24.803
Are you kidding me?

02:24.917 --> 02:26.154
Don't worry, Magnum.

02:26.242 --> 02:27.536
I don't mind paying
your debt.

02:27.624 --> 02:29.576
20% interest.

02:32.238 --> 02:33.239
Hello?

02:33.326 --> 02:34.600
What up, Magnum?

02:34.735 --> 02:36.719
Guys, it's Jin.

02:36.807 --> 02:38.342
Just be quiet.
I don't want him

02:38.436 --> 02:40.200
to get all worked up 'cause
he didn't get invited

02:40.287 --> 02:41.707
to poker night. Okay?

02:41.795 --> 02:42.944
Hey, Jin, what's going on?

02:43.031 --> 02:44.481
Uh, nothing much.
I was just calling...

02:44.568 --> 02:47.166
Wait, do I hear poker chips
being stacked?

02:47.253 --> 02:49.864
S... Uh, stop, stop, stop.

02:49.951 --> 02:52.084
How could he even hear them?

02:52.171 --> 02:53.639
Wait, is that Rick?

02:53.727 --> 02:55.991
Rick got invited
to poker night and not me?

02:56.091 --> 02:58.354
Jin, you know, Rick is
one of my best friends.

02:58.442 --> 03:00.332
Yeah, and so am I.
I helped you bring down

03:00.420 --> 03:01.528
the Killer of Waianae.

03:01.615 --> 03:02.812
- That was Rick.
- Yeah, eh,

03:02.899 --> 03:04.291
well, mostly Higgins.

03:04.379 --> 03:05.985
<i>I can't believe you guys
are playing poker without me.</i>

03:06.072 --> 03:07.682
Dude,
it was an impromptu game.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.168
Well, you can impromptu ask me.
The night is still young.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.816
All right.

03:11.904 --> 03:13.554
Jin, would you care
to join us for poker night?

03:13.641 --> 03:15.389
Sorry, can't,
but thanks for the invite.

03:15.477 --> 03:16.913
Then why'd you fish
for an invite?

03:16.977 --> 03:18.850
<i>'Cause I just like the warm
feeling of being welcome.</i>

03:18.937 --> 03:21.021
<i>Anyway, I'm calling to refer
a client to you guys.</i>

03:21.112 --> 03:22.951
Oh, really? Okay.

03:23.039 --> 03:24.506
<i>Yeah, it's a really
important case,</i>

03:24.594 --> 03:26.171
<i>but I can't really
talk about it on the phone.</i>

03:26.258 --> 03:28.565
Well, I'll come see you
in person if it's for a client.

03:28.653 --> 03:30.598
Great.
But not right now.

03:30.686 --> 03:32.246
How about 7:00 a.m. tomorrow?

03:32.334 --> 03:34.068
But why wait
if it's important?

03:34.156 --> 03:35.419
'Cause that's when
visiting hours start.

03:35.506 --> 03:38.568
Hold on.
Jin, where are you?

03:39.064 --> 03:41.066
I'm at my favorite resort.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:56.985 --> 03:58.987
Good to see you guys.

03:59.169 --> 04:01.823
It's good to see you.
What's with the hand?

04:01.949 --> 04:03.450
You're supposed to press
your hand against the glass

04:03.537 --> 04:04.574
where mine is.

04:04.684 --> 04:05.809
It's a thing.

04:06.369 --> 04:07.455
You've never seen a movie

04:07.543 --> 04:09.449
- about jail before?
- I'm not doing that.

04:09.551 --> 04:11.044
Besides, how'd you
end up back in jail?

04:11.131 --> 04:13.567
Oh, I don't consider it a jail.
It's more of a second home.

04:13.655 --> 04:15.729
Are you really surprised?
I mean, it's Jin.

04:15.817 --> 04:17.224
Yeah, but I thought
he turned a corner.

04:17.310 --> 04:18.702
Yeah, me, too.
But the problem is

04:18.791 --> 04:22.137
I turned four corners
and I ended up right back here.

04:22.969 --> 04:26.582
Fine. I'm back in
because I violated my parole.

04:26.718 --> 04:28.753
I missed a meeting with my P.O.
because I was helping you

04:28.840 --> 04:30.535
- catch the Killer of Waianae.
- No.

04:30.623 --> 04:32.161
You missed your meeting
because you were trying

04:32.248 --> 04:35.028
to recover 50 grand
in laundered cash.

04:35.116 --> 04:36.117
- Semantics.
- Listen,

04:36.205 --> 04:37.325
we don't really
have time for this.

04:37.412 --> 04:38.674
And who is your friend?

04:38.777 --> 04:39.908
This is my friend
Rocky Ahn.

04:40.152 --> 04:41.542
Rocky Ahn, this is

04:41.630 --> 04:43.588
Thomas Magnum
and Juliet Higgins.

04:43.676 --> 04:45.243
Tell them
what you told me.

04:46.972 --> 04:48.323
Okay.

04:49.218 --> 04:50.853
So, the highest-ranked
gangbanger in here

04:50.941 --> 04:52.706
is this dude Tall John.

04:52.794 --> 04:54.100
Now, he's still
a shot caller.

04:54.188 --> 04:55.761
Even in prison
he's making moves.

04:55.925 --> 04:59.409
Anyway, I overheard him
talking to one of his crew.

04:59.497 --> 05:01.128
Now, someone
on the outside hired him

05:01.229 --> 05:03.258
to order a hit
on a civilian.

05:04.390 --> 05:05.597
Do you know who?

05:05.685 --> 05:07.401
No. I didn't get a name.

05:07.589 --> 05:09.598
But I overheard the time and
place it's supposed to go down.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.231
Ah, I told you
this was big.

05:11.319 --> 05:12.582
All we have to do
is go out there

05:12.669 --> 05:13.830
and find out who's in danger.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.472
Right after you guys
bail me out.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.276
Ah. There's always
an angle with this one.

05:17.403 --> 05:18.800
What is that supposed to mean?

05:18.888 --> 05:20.573
That this smells like
an elaborate scheme

05:20.710 --> 05:22.143
for us to bail you out of jail.

05:22.231 --> 05:24.539
Yeah, okay, this is something
that I would do,

05:24.737 --> 05:26.034
but Rocky is my friend,

05:26.122 --> 05:28.037
and I want to see
this through. Trust me.

05:28.125 --> 05:29.605
This is real.
He's right.

05:29.790 --> 05:31.923
The second I told Jin
what I overheard,

05:32.011 --> 05:34.274
he convinced me
we needed to do something.

05:34.370 --> 05:35.776
And that he knew
just who to call.

05:35.864 --> 05:38.018
- What exactly did you overhear?
- Yeah.

05:38.106 --> 05:40.717
When and where is this supposed
hit going to happen?

05:41.435 --> 05:43.159
Go ahead, go.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.476
This stays between us.
Yeah?

05:48.761 --> 05:50.839
Look, if someone's getting shot,

05:51.132 --> 05:52.925
we have to notify HPD.

05:53.013 --> 05:54.797
No, no, no, no cops.
No cops.

05:54.885 --> 05:56.801
Cops gon-are gonna want
to know where we got our info.

05:56.888 --> 05:58.934
I don't want anyone to know
that Rocky's the source.

05:59.084 --> 06:00.137
I-If it gets out
that I snitched

06:00.224 --> 06:02.183
on Tall John, I'm a dead man.

06:02.271 --> 06:04.042
Look, we have a
trusted friend in HPD.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.914
He will take you out
of general population,

06:06.002 --> 06:08.222
- make sure that you're protected.
- Forget it.

06:08.310 --> 06:09.791
You don't know the reach
the guys have in here.

06:09.878 --> 06:12.339
Look, I'll tell
you what I know.

06:12.436 --> 06:15.003
But only if you promise
not to tell the cops.

06:15.091 --> 06:17.877
They can't know
under any circumstances.

06:21.726 --> 06:24.903
Okay.
You have our word.

06:28.527 --> 06:30.094
All right.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.663
The hit's going down
at noon today.

06:33.190 --> 06:36.589
At 125 Ko'ahana.

06:40.895 --> 06:42.675
That's a public park.

06:42.763 --> 06:44.417
That is a very big area
to cover when

06:44.505 --> 06:46.447
we don't even know
who the target is

06:46.535 --> 06:47.809
and all we have to go on
is the time and place.

06:47.896 --> 06:49.724
I mean, we would have to go
now.

06:49.812 --> 06:51.161
So you're taking the case?

06:51.249 --> 06:53.817
Well, seeing as how we're
literally the only ones

06:53.905 --> 06:54.950
who can stop
a killer,

06:55.038 --> 06:56.909
looks like we don't
have a choice.

I just want to say thanks
for bailing me out, you guys.

07:22.481 --> 07:25.839
"You guys"? Higgy wanted
to leave you locked up.

07:26.053 --> 07:27.237
Thanks, Magnum.

07:27.342 --> 07:29.344
Higgins, I was hoping
we could work through

07:29.432 --> 07:31.225
some of the sexual tension
burning between us.

07:31.312 --> 07:33.386
Jin, no tension.
Merely disappointment.

07:33.497 --> 07:36.120
With you, it's an endless cycle
of bad decisions and redemption.

07:36.208 --> 07:37.300
It's tedious.

07:37.388 --> 07:40.130
Oh, that's right.
I'm in redemption mode.

07:40.218 --> 07:42.895
I'm ready to help. Speaking of,
since I brought you this case,

07:42.983 --> 07:44.308
and there's only
the three of us,

07:44.403 --> 07:46.515
can we please use
the Range Rover?

07:47.184 --> 07:49.273
Sorry, it's in the shop.

08:02.646 --> 08:04.213
Looks like the barbecue's
the only thing

08:04.301 --> 08:05.369
going on in the park.

08:05.457 --> 08:06.502
That's right.

08:06.604 --> 08:07.924
Someone there
could be our target.

08:08.012 --> 08:09.564
What do we do now?
Stake it out from here?

08:09.651 --> 08:11.218
No, we have to identify
the hit man.

08:11.305 --> 08:13.500
Best chance of doing that's on foot.
We actually got to be

08:13.587 --> 08:15.853
- up close and at the barbecue.
- Nice.

08:15.941 --> 08:17.310
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

08:17.398 --> 08:19.476
The only problem is
we have no idea

08:19.564 --> 08:20.967
- who we're looking for.
- Not exactly.

08:21.054 --> 08:23.447
We're looking for someone
who seems out of place.

08:23.534 --> 08:26.973
Likely on their own.
Someone who seems distracted.

08:27.060 --> 08:28.670
Somebody who's not
eating or mingling

08:28.757 --> 08:30.515
and most likely
wearing layers

08:30.603 --> 08:31.625
to conceal a weapon.

08:31.713 --> 08:33.227
You guys just basically
described all my friends.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.578
Okay, so Rocky said that
this was gonna happen at noon, right?

08:35.666 --> 08:37.383
That's right. That gives us
less than 15 minutes

08:37.470 --> 08:39.087
to identify and neutralize
any threat.

08:39.176 --> 08:40.376
I love it when
she talks like that.

08:40.462 --> 08:42.118
- She's like an action hero.
- Okay, let's move.

<i>♪ Plant me a koa tree ♪</i>

08:45.469 --> 08:48.377
<i>♪ Don't you cry for me ♪</i>

08:48.465 --> 08:50.838
<i>♪ Plant me a koa tree... ♪</i>

08:51.549 --> 08:52.656
Hey.

08:52.744 --> 08:54.223
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:54.870 --> 08:57.655
Um, cranberry soda, please.

08:57.742 --> 08:59.166
- You got it, miss.
- Thank you.

08:59.269 --> 09:02.431
<i>♪ You touched all the people
with your music... ♪</i>

09:07.369 --> 09:10.016
So I've just arrived.
Uh, has it been this mellow all day?

09:11.024 --> 09:12.163
It's Hawaii, miss.

09:12.251 --> 09:13.454
Every day's this mellow.

09:13.541 --> 09:14.672
- Right.
- Enjoy.

09:14.759 --> 09:16.150
Thanks.

09:16.725 --> 09:20.877
♪ With your magical
Hawaiian voice... ♪

09:22.744 --> 09:24.508
Nothing so far.
How about you?

09:24.595 --> 09:27.424
No. All I see is shiny,
happy people everywhere I look.

09:27.511 --> 09:29.644
<i>♪ A koa tree, uh-huh... ♪</i>

09:29.731 --> 09:31.640
- Hmm. -
- And Jin's working hard.

09:31.728 --> 09:32.429
Yeah...

09:32.516 --> 09:33.961
- Aas ever.
- Can I get your number?

09:34.048 --> 09:35.713
Yeah, sure.

09:37.602 --> 09:38.931
Jin.

09:42.918 --> 09:44.441
Are you working or flirting?

09:44.736 --> 09:45.927
Don't say both.

09:46.015 --> 09:47.501
It's not my fault
that the hottest girl here

09:47.588 --> 09:48.601
gave me her number.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.049
- You got her number?
- Yeah. Let me see it.

09:53.915 --> 09:55.265
Jin, it's fake.

09:56.478 --> 09:58.481
You're just jealous 'cause
I got the number and not you.

09:58.568 --> 09:59.760
It's, like, six digits

09:59.848 --> 10:01.181
and one of them
is the letter E.

10:01.306 --> 10:02.853
That's definitely a three.

10:02.941 --> 10:04.180
And there's only
ten possibilities

10:04.267 --> 10:05.369
for that
seventh number.

10:05.457 --> 10:07.160
She can tell that I'm the type
of guy that lives

10:07.247 --> 10:08.954
- for the thrill of the chase.
- Jin, tell me,

10:09.041 --> 10:10.774
what have you done today
other than convince us

10:10.861 --> 10:11.729
to bail you out of jail,

10:11.816 --> 10:13.601
crash a party so you could
talk to women

10:13.688 --> 10:16.064
and mooch some food
off some strangers?

10:17.533 --> 10:18.605
What is it?

10:18.693 --> 10:20.216
Guy over there, under the tree.

10:20.369 --> 10:21.870
Dark trousers,
blue jacket.

10:21.957 --> 10:23.282
He's carrying a weapon.
Here, hold this.

10:23.369 --> 10:24.838
What?

10:25.221 --> 10:26.570
Stay here.

10:32.498 --> 10:34.500
Excuse me. Sir.

10:35.101 --> 10:36.359
- What the hell?!
- You won't be needing that.

10:36.446 --> 10:37.780
- I will be needing that.
- Why?

10:37.868 --> 10:39.627
It's none of
your business.

10:39.721 --> 10:40.960
I'm a security guard

10:41.048 --> 10:42.318
at the Kohala Center.
I'm just on break.

10:42.405 --> 10:43.406
Let me see some ID.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.480
Now, your turn.
Who the hell are you?

10:50.759 --> 10:52.153
He checks out.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.255
Sorry.

11:10.266 --> 11:11.615
I don't want to die.

11:11.702 --> 11:13.095
You're not going to,
okay?

11:13.182 --> 11:14.309
Stay with me.

11:15.063 --> 11:16.333
Call 911.

11:25.255 --> 11:26.667
Bartender, Ko Chua,
is being rushed

11:26.755 --> 11:28.100
to the hospital
in serious condition.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.043
We're just trying to piece
together what happened.

11:30.130 --> 11:31.261
First question:

11:31.474 --> 11:33.354
what were you all doing here
in the first place?

11:34.638 --> 11:37.364
A client told us
something might go down today.

11:37.997 --> 11:39.238
And you didn't think to tell us?

11:39.325 --> 11:41.034
Well, we didn't have
anything concrete.

11:41.122 --> 11:42.784
Plus, our client
made us promise not

11:42.872 --> 11:44.729
- to tell you guys.
- And who's this client?

11:44.817 --> 11:46.839
Someone confidential
who needs to be protected.

11:46.927 --> 11:48.230
Well, I already know
if your client didn't want you

11:48.317 --> 11:50.050
to talk to the cops,
he's likely a criminal.

11:50.138 --> 11:51.675
Not necessarily.
A lot of people

11:51.763 --> 11:53.254
- don't like talking to the cops.
- Yeah.

11:53.341 --> 11:55.051
But since you're here,
you must have some connection

11:55.138 --> 11:56.793
to them, which supports
the theory that he's shady.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.160
Okay, first of all,
that's offensive.

11:58.247 --> 11:59.436
And second of all,
shouldn't we be

11:59.523 --> 12:00.800
focusing on what
we do know?

12:00.888 --> 12:01.870
He's right.

12:01.966 --> 12:02.952
And Jin actually did get

12:03.040 --> 12:04.442
a good look
at the shooter.

12:06.849 --> 12:09.446
- That's helpful.
- Detective Katsumoto?

12:10.512 --> 12:12.544
Don't slip away, Jin.
I'll be right back.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.128
We need to find
that girl

12:16.216 --> 12:17.621
that gave you
that fake phone number.

12:17.708 --> 12:18.909
I told you it wasn't fake.

12:18.997 --> 12:19.979
It's called gamesmanship.

12:20.067 --> 12:21.995
Jin, we don't care whether
it was real or fake.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.465
We're just saying
that she was obsessed

12:23.552 --> 12:25.183
with videos and selfies,
she might have recorded

12:25.270 --> 12:26.380
something that
could be useful.

12:26.467 --> 12:28.164
Okay, I'm on it.

12:30.606 --> 12:32.140
What are you thinking?

12:32.251 --> 12:34.144
Whether we did the right
thing not telling Katsumoto.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.643
I made a promise to Rocky.

12:35.731 --> 12:37.066
Yes, but now
we're the only two people

12:37.153 --> 12:39.190
who are aware of vital clues
in this case.

12:39.278 --> 12:40.778
That's why we need
to see it through.

12:45.505 --> 12:46.987
Are you sure we
should be teaming up

12:47.075 --> 12:48.536
with a criminal in this?

12:48.684 --> 12:49.833
Criminal?

12:49.942 --> 12:51.263
You're talking about Jin? Well...

12:51.394 --> 12:53.339
Worked cases with him before,
he's fine.

12:53.427 --> 12:54.464
Yeah, but since then,

12:54.552 --> 12:56.333
he has repeatedly
made some

12:56.421 --> 12:57.885
very bad decisions.

12:57.973 --> 12:59.440
Jin's a good guy, all right?

12:59.528 --> 13:00.831
He just gives in
to temptation

13:00.919 --> 13:01.934
once in a while.

13:02.098 --> 13:03.641
I-I think you're being
too judgmental.

13:03.729 --> 13:05.122
I think you're
being too naive.

13:05.294 --> 13:08.395
Maybe, but I genuinely think
he's trying to change.

13:08.762 --> 13:10.684
Leopards don't change
their spots, Thomas.

13:10.772 --> 13:12.637
I know this
from experience.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.832
Yeah, well, I don't think
we should be giving up on him.

13:16.130 --> 13:18.274
Magnum. Higgins.

13:21.572 --> 13:23.095
<i>You gave that guy
your number?</i>

13:23.183 --> 13:24.750
<i>Oh, it was a fake.</i>

13:24.837 --> 13:26.130
<i>I just had to get out of there.</i>

13:26.218 --> 13:27.871
<i>You're terrible.</i>

13:28.101 --> 13:30.105
<i>I'm hungry, though.
Let's go get some food.</i>

13:30.192 --> 13:31.722
You're really
committing to the bit.

13:32.044 --> 13:33.995
I respect the game. Boop.

13:34.083 --> 13:35.592
<i>Oh, it all looks so good.
What do we have?</i>

13:35.679 --> 13:38.595
<i>We have kalua pig, laulau,</i>

13:38.850 --> 13:40.896
sweet potato...

13:42.638 --> 13:43.698
There it is.

13:43.786 --> 13:45.031
You can't see anything.

13:45.118 --> 13:46.020
There's no shot
of the Mustang.

13:46.108 --> 13:47.642
Wait, go back to
before the shooting.

13:47.730 --> 13:49.169
Right there.

13:49.257 --> 13:51.505
You see, the caterer reacts
before anybody else does.

13:51.593 --> 13:53.648
And she runs away
before shots are fired.

13:53.736 --> 13:55.223
She must've recognized
the car.

13:55.311 --> 13:57.661
Um, knowing that whoever
was inside posed a threat.

13:57.749 --> 14:00.059
Yeah, and she hasn't returned
even though it's safe.

14:00.196 --> 14:02.458
That might mean that
the caterer was the real target.

14:02.593 --> 14:05.239
Maybe Ko was just
an innocent bystander.

14:05.327 --> 14:07.216
- What do you got?
- Okay, we think

14:07.304 --> 14:10.106
that this caterer
was the real target.

14:11.357 --> 14:12.708
We don't know who she is.

14:12.798 --> 14:14.747
Ana Chua.
She's Ko's sister.

14:14.835 --> 14:16.360
The host of the barbecue
said he hired them

14:16.447 --> 14:17.434
from the same catering company.

14:17.522 --> 14:19.153
Well, if Ana
was the real target,

14:19.241 --> 14:21.089
then doesn't it mean that she
could still be under threat?

14:21.176 --> 14:22.874
Yeah, we got to find her.
Maybe she went to see Ko

14:22.961 --> 14:24.138
- at the hospital.
- She might be there.

14:24.225 --> 14:25.530
We also need to find
the hit man.

14:25.618 --> 14:27.446
Jin, you're coming to HPD,
help me ID him.

14:27.726 --> 14:29.489
Okay.
Cool.

14:29.654 --> 14:31.411
Let me just spitball
a little bit here.

14:31.513 --> 14:33.372
What if Magnum and I
go to the hospital

14:33.460 --> 14:34.817
and Higgins
can go to HPD?

14:34.905 --> 14:36.515
Or Higgins and I can
go to the hospital

14:36.603 --> 14:38.214
and Magnum go to HPD?

14:38.302 --> 14:40.130
Negative. We spoke
to everyone here.

14:40.218 --> 14:41.568
You're the only one who
got a good look at him.

14:41.655 --> 14:42.830
You're with me, let's go.

14:42.918 --> 14:43.958
There you are.

14:44.894 --> 14:46.243
Have fun.

14:56.677 --> 14:58.287
Good to see you again.

15:03.733 --> 15:05.068
You haven't started going
through the book yet.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.341
I can't.

15:06.429 --> 15:08.075
Everybody's looking at me.

15:09.908 --> 15:11.214
Of course they are.

15:11.379 --> 15:12.684
They know you.

15:14.394 --> 15:15.599
So they're making sure

15:15.687 --> 15:17.380
you're not stealing
anything off my desk.

15:18.006 --> 15:20.286
Come on, get to it.
We're wasting time.

15:33.343 --> 15:34.710
Hey, this is my buddy Jace.

15:34.798 --> 15:36.484
I haven't seen him
in so long.

15:36.572 --> 15:38.313
Wonder if he's
still running scams.

15:38.401 --> 15:40.140
He had such a gift.

15:43.656 --> 15:45.484
Tommy G, the shoplifter.

15:45.572 --> 15:47.531
What happened to all his hair?

15:47.619 --> 15:49.024
He should steal
some Propecia.

15:56.576 --> 15:58.187
Oh, my God.

15:58.512 --> 16:00.296
This one's mine.

16:00.952 --> 16:02.328
Double chin.

16:02.416 --> 16:05.332
Hey, can retake this photo,
but from a different angle?

16:05.469 --> 16:06.513
My good side?

16:06.601 --> 16:07.689
Not a chance.

16:08.041 --> 16:09.434
Why not? I mean...

16:09.522 --> 16:11.134
Some of these photos
get leaked on the Internet.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.492
That one guy
got a modeling contract.

16:19.735 --> 16:20.605
Oh, my God.

16:20.763 --> 16:21.721
That's him.

16:21.823 --> 16:22.780
Who, another buddy?

16:22.868 --> 16:24.343
No, man, the shooter.

16:24.431 --> 16:25.687
That's him.

16:29.186 --> 16:31.601
- This way.
- Thank you.Thanks.

16:34.955 --> 16:36.226
Hello.

16:36.834 --> 16:37.879
Hi.

16:38.107 --> 16:39.296
My name is Thomas Magnum.

16:39.384 --> 16:40.765
This is Juliet Higgins.

16:40.954 --> 16:42.382
We're private investigators.

16:42.470 --> 16:45.437
Hi, uh, I'm Ko's
Uncle Kinny.

16:45.525 --> 16:46.985
We're really sorry
about what happened.

16:47.072 --> 16:48.679
Uh, how is he doing?

16:48.826 --> 16:50.343
He's been out
the whole time.

16:50.431 --> 16:51.531
Nurse says
he'll be okay.

16:51.619 --> 16:53.055
Just needs to rest up
a little bit.

16:53.241 --> 16:54.721
That's great to hear.

16:54.871 --> 16:56.203
Has Ana been here?

16:56.291 --> 16:58.641
No. Uh, I'm surprised
she hasn't come by yet.

16:58.729 --> 16:59.948
Do you happen to know
if she's been

17:00.035 --> 17:01.739
in any kind of trouble recently?

17:02.130 --> 17:03.773
Is that what this is all about?

17:03.954 --> 17:07.085
We can't say for sure,
but we're trying to find out.

17:09.015 --> 17:10.494
That's Jin.

17:10.772 --> 17:12.296
Excuse us for a second.

17:13.837 --> 17:15.098
Hey, what's up?

17:15.186 --> 17:16.666
Magnum, we ID'd
the shooter.

17:16.755 --> 17:18.626
His name is Trevor Bates.

17:18.781 --> 17:20.566
Katsumoto says
he has a long rap sheet.

17:20.654 --> 17:22.176
We're texting you the photo now.

17:22.553 --> 17:23.453
Got it.

17:23.540 --> 17:26.101
Katsumoto's looking into
any known associates.

17:26.775 --> 17:27.835
Oh, my God. What?

17:27.923 --> 17:29.123
He's here in the room.

17:33.313 --> 17:34.880
Elevator.

17:42.035 --> 17:43.421
Stairs.

17:43.661 --> 17:46.055
We can cut him off
on the third floor.

17:55.499 --> 17:57.139
Must have gotten out
on a different floor.

17:57.227 --> 17:58.351
Okay.

18:12.769 --> 18:14.057
Clearly not his uncle.

18:14.145 --> 18:15.714
Must have been waiting
for Ana to show up

18:15.801 --> 18:17.526
so he could finish the job.

18:27.074 --> 18:28.191
I have to say,

18:28.279 --> 18:29.777
it's nice to partner up.

18:31.124 --> 18:33.289
Steady, Jin, we're
not partners.

18:33.377 --> 18:35.305
Magnum's just
at the hospital with HPD

18:35.393 --> 18:37.221
checking the nearby
security footage.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.914
Wait, is this
the same Range Rover

18:40.002 --> 18:41.531
that was supposed
to be in the shop?

18:43.271 --> 18:45.734
Uh... yes, it is, yes.

18:45.822 --> 18:48.367
Wow.
That was a quick repair.

18:48.610 --> 18:50.492
Are you sure
it's safe enough to drive?

18:51.247 --> 18:52.292
Yeah.

18:52.456 --> 18:53.588
Yeah, it's fine.

18:53.676 --> 18:55.982
Mm. I see.

19:14.616 --> 19:16.202
Higgins, cops,
quick, hold my hand.

19:16.290 --> 19:17.465
Pretend we're a couple.

19:19.482 --> 19:22.874
They are here in case Ana
returns to her apartment.

19:23.346 --> 19:25.249
I gave Detective
Katsumoto the heads-up

19:25.337 --> 19:26.272
that we'd be stopping by.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.085
In any case, wh-what would
holding hands accomplish?

19:29.180 --> 19:31.624
Clearly, you know nothing
about the art of disguise.

19:31.784 --> 19:33.133
Clearly.

19:34.123 --> 19:35.429
Officer.

19:35.962 --> 19:37.296
My name is
Juliet Higgins.

19:37.384 --> 19:38.428
Detective Katsumoto...

19:38.516 --> 19:39.921
Said you might be swinging by.

19:40.009 --> 19:42.421
Ana wasn't home. However,
clear signs of forced entry.

19:42.547 --> 19:44.201
Could have been
Uncle Kinny.

19:44.289 --> 19:45.290
Whoever it was

19:45.378 --> 19:46.466
left before we got here.

19:46.574 --> 19:48.007
Okay, thank you.

20:07.344 --> 20:09.738
Looks like somebody
was on a tight budget.

20:09.911 --> 20:10.999
How do you figure?

20:11.087 --> 20:12.262
Ramen noodles.

20:12.607 --> 20:13.863
Three 12 packs,

20:13.951 --> 20:16.583
that's 36 meals,
that's 25 cents each.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.380
That's actually
pretty observant of you, Jin.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.294
Oh, I've lived off
these for years.

20:21.432 --> 20:22.723
What, in college?

20:22.811 --> 20:24.678
No, I know I give
off a smart vibe,

20:24.766 --> 20:26.286
but I didn't even
graduate high school.

20:27.518 --> 20:28.780
You don't say?

20:28.868 --> 20:30.711
No, it's true.
My little sisters and I

20:30.799 --> 20:32.279
didn't have much growing up.

20:32.366 --> 20:34.295
My parents weren't
really around.

20:34.511 --> 20:37.029
Actually, that's
why I started stealing.

20:37.624 --> 20:39.186
I wanted to give
my little sisters

20:39.274 --> 20:40.405
enough to get by.

20:40.493 --> 20:42.018
They're doing great now...
One's a nurse,

20:42.105 --> 20:43.607
the other one's a teacher.

20:44.770 --> 20:46.162
I always say
to myself,

20:46.775 --> 20:48.115
I had to go down my path

20:48.203 --> 20:50.161
just so
they wouldn't have to.

20:51.029 --> 20:52.256
Oh.

20:52.506 --> 20:55.154
Well, that might be true, Jin.

20:55.242 --> 20:57.295
But it sounds like
they're doing pretty well now.

20:57.434 --> 20:59.098
Mm, I would say
that you probably

20:59.186 --> 21:00.941
don't have to continue
down this path.

21:01.154 --> 21:03.162
Yeah, but this is just
who I am.

21:03.250 --> 21:04.643
It's hard to quit
something when

21:05.182 --> 21:06.622
that's the only thing
you're good at.

21:08.021 --> 21:09.256
Well...

21:12.919 --> 21:14.703
Wait a minute.

21:23.747 --> 21:25.459
Okay, what are you doing,

21:25.547 --> 21:27.178
aside from making a mess?

21:27.266 --> 21:29.181
People don't normally
shred things

21:29.269 --> 21:31.358
that aren't important
or confidential, right?

21:31.680 --> 21:33.682
Oh, there might be
something here

21:33.770 --> 21:34.843
that's gonna
help us figure out

21:34.930 --> 21:36.561
- what Ana's next move is.
- Mm-hmm.

21:36.651 --> 21:38.262
But it'll take a month
to put it back together.

21:38.349 --> 21:40.445
No, there are programs that can
actually do it for you now.

21:40.532 --> 21:42.295
You have to photograph
every single shred,

21:42.383 --> 21:43.748
but it's slightly less tedious

21:43.836 --> 21:45.274
than putting them
back together manually.

21:45.361 --> 21:46.756
I'm sure I can enlist Kumu.

21:46.851 --> 21:47.809
Yeah, but aside
from these shreds,

21:47.897 --> 21:49.436
we have nothing else
to go on.

21:49.835 --> 21:51.069
Sadly so.

21:51.157 --> 21:53.406
The girl we're trying to protect
is on the run, and the guy

21:53.493 --> 21:56.032
who ordered the hit on her
is stuck in prison,

21:56.120 --> 21:57.930
so we can't get to him.

22:00.536 --> 22:02.273
Wait.

22:04.094 --> 22:05.791
Maybe we can.

22:06.089 --> 22:08.524
Why are you looking at me
like I'm a piece of meat?

22:11.777 --> 22:13.169
To your right.

22:14.814 --> 22:16.685
Okay, one more from this angle.

22:16.874 --> 22:18.782
Do we have a better
lighting option than this?

22:18.870 --> 22:20.158
No, we're done.
You got your reshoot.

22:20.245 --> 22:22.743
Okay, do you want me to do this
or what?

22:27.745 --> 22:30.400
Yeah. That's the one.
I'm gonna put that on Tinder.

22:30.488 --> 22:33.186
Okay.
Photoshoot's over.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.757
It's time to focus,
all right?

22:35.155 --> 22:38.282
- Your mission...
- Should I choose to accept it...

22:39.652 --> 22:41.071
I accept it.

22:41.512 --> 22:42.735
Just get close to Tall John

22:42.823 --> 22:44.223
and do whatever
it takes to find out

22:44.759 --> 22:46.065
who hired him
and ordered the hit, okay?

22:46.152 --> 22:48.023
Okay. I got this. Because if you fail,

22:48.110 --> 22:49.895
we might just
have to keep you in there.

22:49.983 --> 22:51.455
That's a little harsh.

22:56.483 --> 22:57.658
He serious?

22:59.290 --> 23:01.478

23:23.298 --> 23:26.267
Hey, why are Tall John's guys
huddled around him so closely?

23:26.358 --> 23:28.689
Oh, that move is
called the teepee.

23:28.903 --> 23:32.428
They're just blocking Tall John.
He's got a burner phone.

23:32.516 --> 23:35.762
Something's about to go down.
My guess it has something to do

23:35.850 --> 23:37.530
with the hit he ordered
that went sideways.

23:38.114 --> 23:40.231
I have to know who he's texting.

23:40.356 --> 23:43.169
It's probably the guy that hired
Tall John to do the hit.

23:43.257 --> 23:44.474
Well, there's no way
to know for sure

23:44.561 --> 23:46.708
unless you literally
had that phone.

23:46.796 --> 23:48.708
Yeah. That's the plan.

23:48.796 --> 23:50.014
What's the plan?

23:50.939 --> 23:53.489
Wonder Twin powers activate.

23:54.046 --> 23:55.497
It's go time.

24:01.232 --> 24:03.262
Hey, Kumu, can I ask you
a serious question?

24:03.350 --> 24:05.278
Of course.

24:07.842 --> 24:09.396
Do you
think I'm doing a really good job

24:09.483 --> 24:11.703
with these decorations?

24:13.098 --> 24:14.270
TC,

24:14.358 --> 24:16.004
you're absolutely
killing it.

24:16.092 --> 24:17.465
Really, guys?

24:17.656 --> 24:19.137
What's wrong?

24:21.817 --> 24:22.982
I ask you to come here,

24:23.069 --> 24:24.281
help decorate
the place

24:24.385 --> 24:25.739
for karaoke night,
and all you can do is just

24:25.826 --> 24:27.668
sit here
and goof around.

24:27.756 --> 24:29.281
Can't you take
anything seriously?

24:31.695 --> 24:33.899
Looks like I'm gonna
have to take a break from this.

24:34.032 --> 24:36.578
Magnum and Higgins
need a favor.

24:37.089 --> 24:38.314
Welcome to the club.

24:38.729 --> 24:40.055
Here.

24:45.375 --> 24:47.195
Hi.

24:50.533 --> 24:52.419
Stop with the hand,
okay? I'm not doing that.

24:52.507 --> 24:54.964
You're gonna want to
after I tell you what I got.

24:58.553 --> 25:00.175
Tall John's burner phone.

25:00.263 --> 25:02.878
- Wow. Well done, Jin.
- Thanks, partner.

25:03.605 --> 25:05.386
Magnum?

25:06.644 --> 25:08.907
Fine.

25:09.698 --> 25:10.737
I've missed you.

25:10.825 --> 25:12.738
- How'd you get the phone?
- You're actually gonna

25:12.825 --> 25:14.519
ask me that
knowing my profession?

25:15.471 --> 25:16.628
Fair enough.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.544
Okay,
so Tall John was hired

25:18.632 --> 25:20.155
by a guy by the name
of Bill Nash.

25:20.243 --> 25:22.081
Bill Nash?
I've heard of him.

25:22.169 --> 25:24.276
He's a big
real estate mogul.

25:26.391 --> 25:27.582
Why would a successful
businessman

25:27.669 --> 25:29.839
hire an imprisoned gangster
to take out a caterer?

25:29.927 --> 25:31.278
No idea.
But there's always been

25:31.366 --> 25:33.230
this cloud of suspicion
surrounding Nash.

25:33.379 --> 25:35.776
Rumor has it that
some of his affiliations

25:35.864 --> 25:37.561
are with some seriously
shady people.

25:37.649 --> 25:39.901
Obviously he's using Tall John
to do his bidding.

25:39.995 --> 25:42.196
He was accused of
using his shady connections

25:42.284 --> 25:43.432
to get where he is today.

25:43.519 --> 25:44.846
He's denied
every single allegation,

25:44.933 --> 25:45.939
of course.

25:46.026 --> 25:46.987
Oh, it's Kumu.

25:47.075 --> 25:49.917
I'll text Katsumoto
to fill him in. Kumu?

25:50.178 --> 25:52.292
I finished uploading
all the shreds.

25:52.380 --> 25:54.066
It's recreating
the documents now.

25:54.215 --> 25:56.329
Guys, you know
I love you, I do,

25:56.417 --> 25:57.902
I really do,
and I want to help,

25:57.990 --> 26:00.050
okay, but if you're
gonna use this table

26:00.138 --> 26:02.184
as your office space,
we're gonna have to work out

26:02.272 --> 26:03.451
some kind of rental fee.

26:03.539 --> 26:04.550
Rental fee?
Hold on,

26:04.638 --> 26:06.645
Starbucks doesn't charge people
for using their tables

26:06.732 --> 26:07.995
- or their Wi-Fi.
- That's because

26:08.082 --> 26:09.371
they have paying customers.

26:09.459 --> 26:10.614
At least they
buy a cup of coffee.

26:10.701 --> 26:12.652
Okay, well,
put Kumu's coffee on my tab.

26:12.740 --> 26:15.569
No, no, a tab is something
that people eventually pay.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.003
What you have is a

26:17.091 --> 26:19.644
massive unsecured
building debt.

26:21.093 --> 26:22.312
It's done.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.228
I'm sending the documents now.

26:25.193 --> 26:28.519
Kumu, I love you. Rick,
thank you for the office space.

26:28.607 --> 26:31.305
Yeah, well, thanks doesn't
pay the bills around here, pal.

26:32.655 --> 26:34.660
It's a few bills, paystubs

26:34.748 --> 26:37.535
and statements.

26:38.385 --> 26:41.105
Wow, she really doesn't get paid
much for as hard as she works.

26:41.193 --> 26:43.691
We knew this by looking
at her apartment.

26:43.989 --> 26:45.292
Okay, this is interesting.

26:45.380 --> 26:47.700
On every payday, she deposits
her checks and gets money out

26:47.787 --> 26:49.066
at the same ATM
like clockwork.

26:49.154 --> 26:50.722
That makes sense for someone
living check to check.

26:50.809 --> 26:52.985
Well, the thing is
is today happens to be payday.

26:53.152 --> 26:54.652
Why would she go to
that ATM now that

26:54.740 --> 26:56.575
- she's fearing for her life?
- If someone's in hiding

26:56.662 --> 26:57.832
and they're low on cash, they...

26:57.919 --> 27:00.748
It might be the only option.
It's worth a shot.

27:00.836 --> 27:03.652
Agreed. Okay. Come on, we'll pay
your bail on the way out.

27:03.748 --> 27:05.817
Wait, wait, wait. You're gonna
have to hold off on that.

27:05.904 --> 27:07.755
I've got a couple of things
cooking in here.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.639
All right, just leave him here.
I don't have time for this.

27:09.726 --> 27:10.822
No, wait.

27:10.910 --> 27:13.722
Jin, you are better
and worth more

27:13.817 --> 27:15.974
than anything you could
have cooking in here.

27:16.216 --> 27:18.974
Okay? We're paying your bail,
you're coming with us.

27:20.044 --> 27:21.537
Okay.

27:30.582 --> 27:32.302
Okay, there's the ATM.

27:32.603 --> 27:35.529
History repeats itself,
Ana should be here soon.

27:38.216 --> 27:41.333
You know, you were really quick
to bail out Jin today.

27:42.068 --> 27:44.480
Yeah, well, I am learning
that what Jin thinks

27:44.568 --> 27:47.168
he wants and what he actually
wants are quite different.

27:54.483 --> 27:56.241
Okay, there she is.

27:56.467 --> 27:57.809
We got to
approach her calmly

27:57.897 --> 27:59.983
because she's probably
already on high alert.

28:02.608 --> 28:03.991
Magnum...

28:04.744 --> 28:06.216
That's Kinny.

28:19.841 --> 28:21.016
He's out cold.

28:21.275 --> 28:22.530
Where's Ana?

28:33.507 --> 28:34.769
Almost there.

28:38.358 --> 28:40.265
Gentle with his head.

28:40.496 --> 28:41.593
Okay.

28:41.702 --> 28:44.575
- He'll be fine.
- Magnum, what are you...

28:44.741 --> 28:46.249
Detective Higgins,
this is

28:46.337 --> 28:47.687
Keno and his
girlfriend Lani.

28:47.775 --> 28:49.280
They were kind enough

28:49.367 --> 28:50.669
to help me.

28:50.757 --> 28:52.004
This is my partner.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.716
Shoot, it's undercover cops.

28:53.804 --> 28:54.663
- Yeah.
- Cool.

28:54.751 --> 28:56.469
Well, uh, thank you, guys,
but I think we got it from here.

28:56.556 --> 28:58.437
Thanks. Appreciate the help.

28:59.149 --> 29:00.952
What? You try carrying
that body. He's heavy.

29:01.058 --> 29:02.477
I thought you promised
Detective Katsumoto

29:02.564 --> 29:05.280
that you would retire
that stupid false badge.

29:05.375 --> 29:06.789
We're gonna argue over something
that's already done?

29:06.876 --> 29:08.124
Right. Ana's gone.

29:08.212 --> 29:09.954
And she can't have got far,
otherwise you would've seen her

29:10.041 --> 29:11.539
running up the street.
I think she's got to be in

29:11.626 --> 29:13.968
- one of these two buildings.
- Right.

29:15.894 --> 29:17.452
Divide and conquer.

29:38.006 --> 29:40.008
Uh, excuse me, sir.

29:40.095 --> 29:42.445
Does everybody need a key card
to use the elevator?

29:42.532 --> 29:43.919
Yeah.
Stairs, too.

29:44.143 --> 29:47.059
Okay.
Much obliged.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.026
Now just the exterior cameras
from the front

29:56.114 --> 29:58.487
of the building
about seven minutes ago.

30:03.717 --> 30:05.719
I don't see anything.

31:05.201 --> 31:06.333
Ana.

31:07.854 --> 31:09.677
Ana,
my name is Juliet Higgins.

31:09.765 --> 31:12.005
My partner and I,
we're private investigators.

31:12.093 --> 31:14.020
Listen, we're here
to help you.

31:14.108 --> 31:15.639
We're the ones
that just took out that man

31:15.726 --> 31:17.325
who was chasing you.

31:18.223 --> 31:20.617
We were also
at the barbecue earlier.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.067
Your brother Ko...

31:23.155 --> 31:25.435
He was shot
and wounded accidentally.

31:26.958 --> 31:29.099
Ko was shot?
Is he okay?

31:29.497 --> 31:32.763
He's fine. He's in recovery
at the hospital.

31:33.746 --> 31:35.489
Oh... I...

31:36.208 --> 31:38.620
I actually met him
at the barbecue today.

31:38.708 --> 31:42.040
He seems like a-a really,
really nice guy.

31:42.661 --> 31:44.145
Look, we're here to help you.

31:44.233 --> 31:46.410
We want to get the men
who are doing this, but...

31:46.817 --> 31:49.020
we need to understand
what's going on.

31:51.130 --> 31:53.724
That car was following me
the past few days.

31:53.921 --> 31:55.200
I thought I was
being paranoid,

31:55.288 --> 31:57.275
but this morning it was
parked outside my building.

31:57.362 --> 31:59.449
When it showed up at work,
I knew someone was after me,

31:59.536 --> 32:00.450
so I ran.

32:00.537 --> 32:02.011
I-I tried calling Ko
on a payphone,

32:02.099 --> 32:03.496
but he didn't pick up.

32:03.989 --> 32:06.760
I just figured he didn't
recognize the number.

32:06.886 --> 32:08.409
It's going to be fine.

32:10.157 --> 32:11.372
I promise.

32:14.630 --> 32:16.341
I have to ask.

32:16.499 --> 32:18.196
Um, why didn't you
call the police?

32:18.661 --> 32:20.052
Uh...

32:20.301 --> 32:22.347
Ko and I are here illegally.

32:22.474 --> 32:26.339
We came here two years ago and
have been working catering jobs

32:26.427 --> 32:28.129
to try to make a life
for ourselves.

32:28.216 --> 32:30.245
I didn't want to risk
losing everything

32:30.333 --> 32:31.916
we have been working towards.

32:33.442 --> 32:34.614
I understand.

32:34.701 --> 32:36.745
<i>♪ I don't want to work ♪</i>

32:36.833 --> 32:38.495
<i>♪ I want to bang on the drum ♪</i>

32:38.583 --> 32:40.605
- <i>♪ All day I'll just be a moment. ♪</i>
- Excuse me. I have to take this.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.880
- <i>♪ I don't want to play ♪</i>
- Don't worry. You're safe.

32:43.655 --> 32:45.265
Hi.
I found her.

32:47.505 --> 32:49.761
Ana said that when she was
prepping a dinner party

32:49.849 --> 32:51.807
for a wealthy lawyer
named David Berger

32:51.895 --> 32:53.551
that she accidentally
walked into the wrong room

32:53.638 --> 32:55.474
and saw two men having
a very private meeting.

32:55.578 --> 32:57.708
I saw one of the men
counting out a lot of money

32:57.796 --> 32:59.015
from an envelope.

32:59.129 --> 33:01.317
I apologized, but from
the look on their faces,

33:01.405 --> 33:03.591
they were really upset
that I interrupted them.

33:03.679 --> 33:05.284
I didn't know who they were.

33:05.372 --> 33:07.198
But she was able
to describe them,

33:07.286 --> 33:09.497
and one of the men
was Bill Nash.

33:09.585 --> 33:11.674
The real estate mogul
Jin said ordered the hit.

33:11.762 --> 33:13.144
- Right.
- And who was the other guy?

33:13.231 --> 33:15.722
Ryo Shizuko.
He's a notorious fixer.

33:15.810 --> 33:16.888
Why do I know that name?

33:16.976 --> 33:19.571
Because he's been implicated
in several crimes,

33:19.659 --> 33:20.849
just never been convicted.

33:20.937 --> 33:22.532
The authorities have been
convinced for years

33:22.619 --> 33:24.145
that he's been doing
Nash's dirty work,

33:24.233 --> 33:26.307
but no one's ever been able
to prove the connection,

33:26.395 --> 33:28.075
let alone ever see them
in a room together.

33:28.162 --> 33:29.395
Until now.
I mean,

33:29.483 --> 33:32.496
if you saw Nash
give Shizuko money...

33:32.584 --> 33:34.442
They certainly are
going to want to quiet her.

33:34.554 --> 33:37.583
I mean, Nash's entire real
estate empire's at stake.

33:37.671 --> 33:39.966
That would definitely
make you a loose end, and...

33:40.158 --> 33:41.768
He's not gonna
want to let you live.

33:41.855 --> 33:44.342
We've got to get you down to HPD
and into protective custody.

33:44.430 --> 33:46.235
- Yeah.Y...
- No. No. I can't.

33:46.323 --> 33:47.602
Ana.

33:47.690 --> 33:51.215
We have a very good
friend in HPD.

33:51.380 --> 33:53.628
Honestly, you have
to trust us on this.

34:03.172 --> 34:04.347
Magnum.

34:04.590 --> 34:05.634
The car.

34:05.901 --> 34:07.207
There they are.

34:07.870 --> 34:08.871
Oh!

34:09.052 --> 34:10.487
Let's go.

34:15.286 --> 34:16.592
There's more men?

34:16.781 --> 34:18.414
Tall John must have
called backup.

34:20.996 --> 34:22.677
That's got to be them.
What are they doing?

34:22.803 --> 34:24.726
Clearing the building
of witnesses. Come on.

34:28.081 --> 34:29.940
Magnum?
Where are you?

34:30.027 --> 34:32.339
We're with Ana
at 144 Makka Street.

34:32.427 --> 34:35.010
<i>The men who want her dead
are armed and after us.</i>

34:35.360 --> 34:36.989
How fast can you get here?

34:37.170 --> 34:38.245
Eight minutes.

34:38.333 --> 34:40.121
I don't know that we can
elude them for eight minutes.

34:40.208 --> 34:41.879
You don't have a choice.
I'm on my way.

34:41.967 --> 34:43.503
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna stay alive

34:43.590 --> 34:45.214
until he gets here.

34:50.987 --> 34:52.034
Hey, watch it.

34:52.121 --> 34:53.385
I'm so sorry.

34:55.253 --> 34:57.273
Nice to see Jin
is rubbing off on you.

34:57.317 --> 34:59.674
This accesses both
the elevators and the stairs.

35:00.276 --> 35:02.581
Could be a bad idea. They
take over the building, they

35:02.669 --> 35:04.597
could shut down the elevators.
We'd be trapped in there.

35:04.684 --> 35:06.565
Right.
Stairs it is.

35:22.480 --> 35:23.979
You, cover the entrance.

35:24.067 --> 35:26.612
You two, you go floor to floor
until you find the girl.

35:26.700 --> 35:27.854
Copy.
Come on.

35:27.942 --> 35:29.424
You're with me.

35:52.221 --> 35:54.143
Still seven minutes
until Katsumoto gets here.

35:54.231 --> 35:56.175
He said he was eight minutes
out. It's only been one minute?

35:56.262 --> 35:58.268
Yes. That's how
mathematics works.

35:58.356 --> 35:59.596
Oh...

36:07.149 --> 36:08.806
There were five of them
including Kinny.

36:08.894 --> 36:10.150
There's four of them left.

36:10.237 --> 36:11.886
Oh, you did
that without using your fingers, Magnum.

36:11.973 --> 36:13.932
Well done.
They're coming up.

36:14.399 --> 36:16.025
- Okay...
- I have an idea.

36:16.113 --> 36:17.462
Follow me.

36:28.062 --> 36:30.743
Well, there's not much in here
that can defend against a gun.

36:51.016 --> 36:53.173
Magnum, that ladder
only extends 20 feet.

36:53.261 --> 36:54.329
The other side is too far.

36:54.417 --> 36:56.845
No, it's not. I just did
an ocular distance survey.

36:57.004 --> 36:58.204
I think it's fine.

37:14.987 --> 37:16.252
Right.

37:16.340 --> 37:18.305
And thus concludes
today's mathematics lesson.

37:18.393 --> 37:19.940
They probably heard that.
Let's get out of here.

37:20.027 --> 37:21.063
Come on.

37:26.472 --> 37:27.962
Go back.

37:29.829 --> 37:31.914
They're already on this floor.
We're running out of time.

37:32.001 --> 37:34.132
I have a plan. Well,
it's actually your plan.

37:40.268 --> 37:41.835
Go, go, go.

37:46.547 --> 37:47.979
Oh!

37:49.137 --> 37:50.557
They know where
we are now.

37:50.645 --> 37:52.939
Won't they just be waiting
for us when we get off?

37:59.166 --> 38:01.666
The idea isn't to escape,
it's just to survive.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.643
For the next three minutes,
at least.

38:03.731 --> 38:05.244
But we're trapped.Exactly.

38:05.732 --> 38:08.082
Stopping the elevator creates
a makeshift safe room.

38:08.418 --> 38:10.745
Just give
us the girl and We'll let you go.

38:10.832 --> 38:12.697
Uh, y-yeah, that's-that's
a great idea,

38:12.785 --> 38:15.431
but just give us a minute
so we can put our heads together

38:15.519 --> 38:16.539
and think about this.

38:16.627 --> 38:17.939
Don't be stupid.

38:18.027 --> 38:20.220
We'll bypass the emergency stop
in no time.

38:21.019 --> 38:22.498
Okay.

38:22.930 --> 38:24.930
- All right, you can have the girl...:
- What?

38:25.444 --> 38:28.002
...but just, w-we need
something in return.

38:28.090 --> 38:31.093
You're in no position
to negotiate a list of demands.

38:31.181 --> 38:33.836
No, t-this isn't a list.
We just want one thing.

38:33.924 --> 38:34.968
What?

38:35.056 --> 38:38.205
A-A quarter.
Okay? 25 cents.

38:39.060 --> 38:40.104
Not just any one.

38:40.192 --> 38:43.500
A 1932 Denver-minted
Washington quarter.

38:44.071 --> 38:45.986
If you can get that for us...

38:46.440 --> 38:48.181
you can have the girl.

38:51.908 --> 38:53.910
Deal's off.

38:56.170 --> 38:57.171
What's going on?

38:57.258 --> 38:59.304
They've bypassed
the emergency stop.

38:59.391 --> 39:01.959
I thought you said
this was a safe room.

39:02.116 --> 39:03.247
What's the plan now?

39:07.616 --> 39:09.072
Just stay back.
Get behind me.

39:28.681 --> 39:30.683
You're welcome.

39:32.145 --> 39:34.092
That was more
than eight minutes.

39:34.180 --> 39:35.296
No, it wasn't.

39:35.383 --> 39:36.578
Don't worry.
Magnum's just

39:36.666 --> 39:38.177
terrible with numbers.

39:38.265 --> 39:39.909
It's okay.
You're safe. Come on.

39:57.498 --> 39:59.865
Thank you for keeping her safe.

39:59.992 --> 40:01.994
You're very welcome.

40:04.521 --> 40:05.740
A minute?

40:07.856 --> 40:10.863
We've got Bill Nash
and Ryo Shizuko in custody.

40:10.951 --> 40:12.863
Turns out the payout
that Ana witnessed

40:12.951 --> 40:15.206
was for Shizuko
to deal with some locals

40:15.293 --> 40:17.504
who were in the way of
a big real estate deal for Nash.

40:17.592 --> 40:19.824
So getting Tall John's
burner phone actually helped.

40:19.927 --> 40:22.613
It was crucial in corroborating
Ana's eyewitness account.

40:22.701 --> 40:23.954
Jin did well.

40:24.189 --> 40:25.277
Hate to admit it,

40:25.365 --> 40:26.466
but he really did.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.287
You guys weren't bad,
either.

40:31.184 --> 40:33.061
So now do you think
Jin's changed?

40:33.248 --> 40:36.662
Let's just say
I'm a little less skeptical

40:37.217 --> 40:39.230
and a little more hopeful.

By the way,

41:35.067 --> 41:37.472

41:43.142 --> 41:45.705
We have chemistry.
We make great partners.

41:46.698 --> 41:48.057
Agreed.
