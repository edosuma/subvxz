00:18.874 --> 00:20.241
John.

00:21.877 --> 00:23.878
You need to step away now.

00:26.561 --> 00:28.562
We have to do our work.

00:32.926 --> 00:34.760
You have to move.

00:37.564 --> 00:38.931
John.

00:42.068 --> 00:43.902
Why did you come here tonight?

00:44.571 --> 00:45.938
She,

00:48.074 --> 00:51.376
She left a note saying she'd be here.

00:51.411 --> 00:53.078
Did she say why?

00:55.708 --> 00:57.542
Take photographs.

00:59.919 --> 01:01.086
Okay.

01:01.621 --> 01:03.122
Keep him here.

01:03.156 --> 01:05.057
Put him in your car

01:05.090 --> 01:07.059
the front seat.

01:07.093 --> 01:09.061
Get him a coffee.

01:09.095 --> 01:10.295
Yeah.

01:13.433 --> 01:15.267
C'mon, sit down a minute.

01:18.131 --> 01:19.931
Detective Cardinal.

01:19.959 --> 01:21.960
I'm so sorry.

01:28.167 --> 01:30.168
Harris, bag her hands.

01:30.202 --> 01:31.336
We need to treat this

01:31.370 --> 01:33.371
like any other suspicious death.

01:35.474 --> 01:37.475
I'm gonna need some room Detective.

01:49.154 --> 01:50.522
Come with me.

02:07.339 --> 02:08.705
Go ahead.

02:13.712 --> 02:15.346
I'll be right there.

02:36.569 --> 02:37.769
Lise!

02:56.388 --> 02:58.389
I found the note in her bag.

03:40.265 --> 03:42.100
It's Catherine's handwriting?

03:48.307 --> 03:50.308
Had she been behaving differently?

03:54.446 --> 03:56.447
I thought she was off her meds.

03:59.785 --> 04:02.787
She was talking about quitting therapy.

04:04.456 --> 04:05.623
But,

04:07.326 --> 04:08.793
we talked.

04:09.795 --> 04:12.009
She seemed, She seemed good.

04:13.832 --> 04:15.667
We need to get you home.

04:18.837 --> 04:20.038
Her car,

04:21.040 --> 04:22.940
I don't know what to do about her car.

04:22.975 --> 04:24.976
We'll take care of that.

04:25.644 --> 04:26.811
And you.

04:30.649 --> 04:32.483
You shouldn't be driving.

04:34.653 --> 04:35.820
Yeah.

04:39.491 --> 04:40.858
Come on.

04:41.694 --> 04:43.528
I'll take you home, Detective.

04:54.740 --> 04:56.574
Kelly. It's Dad.

04:59.678 --> 05:00.845
Your,

05:05.851 --> 05:07.685
You need to come home.

06:09.170 --> 06:11.149
You took that?

06:12.751 --> 06:14.886
People always look better in pictures

06:14.920 --> 06:16.754
taken by people who love them.

06:18.090 --> 06:20.258
She hated having her picture taken.

06:20.292 --> 06:21.926
Yeah, she didn't like herself.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.427
That's not true.

06:24.170 --> 06:26.004
All evidence to the contrary.

06:30.602 --> 06:31.769
I'm sorry.

06:35.007 --> 06:37.842
It's just I'm mad at her and I
can't believe that you're not.

06:40.779 --> 06:42.346
Are you okay Dad?

06:44.283 --> 06:45.950
Can you do this?

06:46.852 --> 06:48.119
I'm fine.

06:49.955 --> 06:51.122
It's just,

06:51.824 --> 06:53.024
my feet hurt.

06:53.659 --> 06:55.426
New shoes.

06:55.460 --> 06:57.161
Take them off.

06:57.196 --> 06:59.463
I'm not seeing your mother off in socks.

06:59.498 --> 07:01.132
She'd want you to be comfortable.

07:12.211 --> 07:13.644
How's your sister?

07:14.847 --> 07:16.314
She's not good.

07:16.648 --> 07:17.959
She's got a couple of weeks left.

07:17.983 --> 07:19.150
Maybe days.

07:20.519 --> 07:21.719
I'm sorry.

07:23.155 --> 07:26.157
So you decided against the NIS training?

07:29.661 --> 07:30.628
Yeah.

07:30.662 --> 07:32.530
Yeah, well, maybe it's just as well,

07:32.564 --> 07:34.665
with everything that's going on.

07:47.379 --> 07:48.579
John?

07:51.216 --> 07:52.817
I can let you be alone.

07:52.851 --> 07:54.051
No.

07:54.686 --> 07:56.888
Plenty of time for that.

07:56.922 --> 07:58.962
Dr. Bell, thanks for coming.

07:59.591 --> 08:01.726
I won't ask how you're doing.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.194
But I want to offer my help,

08:03.228 --> 08:05.062
if there's anything at all,

08:05.530 --> 08:06.898
You saw her,

08:08.033 --> 08:09.433
right before.

08:09.701 --> 08:11.535
We had a session, yes.

08:13.705 --> 08:15.406
She tell you what happened between us

08:15.440 --> 08:16.507
in Toronto?

08:16.541 --> 08:17.742
Yes.

08:18.877 --> 08:21.679
But she also told me you'd made up.

08:21.713 --> 08:23.714
She felt good about you two.

08:25.717 --> 08:27.685
There were no signs,

08:27.719 --> 08:28.853
none that I could see,

08:28.887 --> 08:31.022
I-I would have taken steps.

08:31.056 --> 08:32.256
So then,

08:32.557 --> 08:34.392
something happened afterward then,

08:36.061 --> 08:37.895
something to trigger her.

08:38.797 --> 08:40.698
She always had to struggle, John,

08:40.732 --> 08:42.299
you know that.

08:42.967 --> 08:44.802
It was a beautiful service.

08:45.637 --> 08:48.472
So many people loved Catherine.

08:50.275 --> 08:51.876
But of course they did,

08:51.910 --> 08:53.744
she was special.

08:59.084 --> 09:01.285
People are leaving. I-I should,

09:02.321 --> 09:03.754
say my goodbyes.

09:15.434 --> 09:17.435
I don't wanna go inside just yet.

09:18.270 --> 09:20.104
You want to take a walk?

09:21.773 --> 09:22.940
I need to,

09:23.942 --> 09:25.142
lie down.

11:46.523 --> 11:48.690
Island Road house. One hour.

11:50.026 --> 11:51.812
I don't know if I can do one,

11:51.846 --> 11:53.996
but maybe two?

11:54.030 --> 11:54.997
Park down the road,

11:55.031 --> 11:56.665
like last time, all right?

11:56.699 --> 11:57.666
Okay.

11:57.700 --> 11:58.867
Bye.

13:08.171 --> 13:09.605
Anyone see you?

13:10.773 --> 13:12.474
No one's around anymore.

13:12.508 --> 13:13.775
Summer's over.

14:03.685 --> 14:06.687
No no no no no no no.

14:07.530 --> 14:08.630
You're leaving?

14:08.665 --> 14:10.299
I thought we could order in some food,

14:10.333 --> 14:12.134
I'm,

14:12.168 --> 14:14.390
I'm late for dinner again.
This can't keep happening.

14:15.804 --> 14:16.971
Randall.

14:17.407 --> 14:19.408
I don't even have time to take a shower.

14:22.564 --> 14:24.031
Can you wait before you go out?

14:24.180 --> 14:25.347
Randall.

14:25.935 --> 14:27.970
Can we maybe hang out
for more than an hour

14:27.995 --> 14:29.596
together some time?

14:29.719 --> 14:31.853
Yes, I'm-I'm working on that.

14:31.888 --> 14:33.088
Just not tonight.

14:33.856 --> 14:35.023
Okay?

14:36.691 --> 14:37.892
Okay.

14:42.265 --> 14:43.532
Blanket.

14:55.044 --> 14:56.211
Thank you.

14:59.248 --> 15:00.449
Bye.

15:13.062 --> 15:14.696
Wow. That is one hell of a view.

15:16.966 --> 15:18.200
Wow, so big!

15:18.234 --> 15:19.601
It's a nice place.

15:19.635 --> 15:21.036
Is it hers?

15:21.070 --> 15:23.405
No. It's mine.

15:23.439 --> 15:25.207
Where is she?

15:25.241 --> 15:26.875
She's not coming.

15:26.909 --> 15:29.711
She asked me to handle this.

15:29.746 --> 15:31.747
So please, sit down.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.585
That's not what we discussed.

15:36.619 --> 15:38.887
Do you have the money? Yes?

15:38.921 --> 15:41.056
Yes, I have the money.

15:41.090 --> 15:42.257
Then let's celebrate.

15:42.291 --> 15:43.725
Y'know, I'm having second thoughts.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.160
About what?

15:45.194 --> 15:48.130
Roman, I think you should
go and get the guns right now.

15:48.164 --> 15:49.598
Put that thing away.

15:49.632 --> 15:51.400
If you don't I'm gonna kill her,

15:51.434 --> 15:53.969
I'm gonna kill her right in front of you.

15:54.003 --> 15:57.072
Stop it! People know we're here.

15:57.106 --> 15:58.573
Irena, run!

16:00.443 --> 16:01.443
No! No!

18:15.798 --> 18:16.965
Hey.

18:17.466 --> 18:19.100
Catherine's things,

18:19.135 --> 18:20.802
like you requested.

18:21.971 --> 18:23.538
They've been released.

18:43.993 --> 18:46.609
This means no further investigation.

18:47.229 --> 18:49.230
The coroner's ruling of suicide holds.

18:51.667 --> 18:52.834
Yes.

18:55.538 --> 18:57.539
Did you get any more of those cards?

19:01.377 --> 19:03.211
They seem to have stopped.

19:03.913 --> 19:04.979
Like I said,

19:05.014 --> 19:06.481
probably just some ass

19:06.515 --> 19:09.090
who wanted to feel power over a cop.

19:23.532 --> 19:25.533
You can start next week if you want.

19:26.035 --> 19:27.869
Take some time.

19:28.537 --> 19:30.538
No. I'm sick of being on leave.

19:33.075 --> 19:34.909
Need to be busy.

19:43.052 --> 19:44.886
Do you want to drive in together?

19:51.093 --> 19:52.093
No.

19:52.127 --> 19:53.761
I'll drive.

19:53.796 --> 19:54.863
I'll see you there.

19:54.897 --> 19:56.064
Okay.

20:06.408 --> 20:07.942
Hey, what's going on?

20:07.977 --> 20:09.043
We need to talk.

20:09.078 --> 20:10.912
I need to see you.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.547
Later. I promise. I'll call you.

20:12.581 --> 20:13.781
No, listen.

20:16.151 --> 20:17.986
Something happened at the house.

20:19.088 --> 20:20.255
Well, what do you mean?

20:20.289 --> 20:21.890
Did-did someone see you?

20:21.924 --> 20:23.558
People came in and

20:23.592 --> 20:24.993
they were arguing.

20:25.294 --> 20:27.629
I heard gunshots.

20:27.663 --> 20:29.898
Someone chased me.

20:29.932 --> 20:31.099
Just one sec.

20:34.103 --> 20:35.737
Gunshots?

20:35.771 --> 20:36.971
Are you okay?

20:37.006 --> 20:38.606
He tried to kill me.

20:39.180 --> 20:40.973
He shot my car.

20:42.845 --> 20:46.648
Randall, we need to go to the police.

20:46.682 --> 20:48.750
Just, now don't do anything yet.

20:48.784 --> 20:51.419
I-I'll-I'll figure something out.

20:51.453 --> 20:53.121
We can get through this.

20:53.155 --> 20:54.122
But I gotta go.

20:54.156 --> 20:57.992
Just wait for my call, okay?

20:58.027 --> 20:59.460
Trust me, Sam.

21:00.362 --> 21:01.796
Okay. Bye.

21:27.656 --> 21:29.490
It's good to have you back.

21:30.659 --> 21:32.660
I'm sorry to hear about your sister.

21:44.006 --> 21:45.173
Thanks.

21:47.409 --> 21:49.143
Three different ATMs,

21:49.178 --> 21:50.211
three victims,

21:50.245 --> 21:52.146
all in the last week.

21:52.181 --> 21:53.548
And he escapes how?

21:54.583 --> 21:56.351
We think he parks a getaway car nearby

21:56.385 --> 21:58.152
but nobody's seen it.

21:58.187 --> 21:59.854
What can I do to help?

21:59.888 --> 22:01.522
Can I speak to you?

22:02.224 --> 22:03.424
Yep.

22:06.195 --> 22:07.996
We have a situation on Island Road.

22:08.030 --> 22:09.831
I want you to take the lead.

22:09.865 --> 22:12.000
Shouldn't I stay on the ATM thing?

22:12.034 --> 22:14.369
It's his first day back.

22:14.403 --> 22:16.037
This looks like a mess.

22:16.271 --> 22:17.705
He's not ready.

22:19.948 --> 22:21.115
Okay.

22:29.218 --> 22:30.752
Cardinal,

22:30.786 --> 22:32.420
ride with me.

23:04.912 --> 23:06.754
Looks like the bodies were

23:06.789 --> 23:08.723
dragged out.

23:08.757 --> 23:10.758
There's more blood on the carpet here.

23:12.051 --> 23:13.061
Bullet hole.

23:13.095 --> 23:15.229
Brain matter over here.

23:15.264 --> 23:17.065
That's one victim.

23:17.099 --> 23:18.766
Another one over there.

23:20.769 --> 23:22.770
At least two people died in this house.

23:24.606 --> 23:26.407
So where are the bodies?

23:33.315 --> 23:35.149
Mail said the Schumachers.

23:36.618 --> 23:38.052
It's a handgun,

23:38.087 --> 23:39.130
looks like nine millimetres,

23:39.154 --> 23:40.788
same as the casings.

23:40.823 --> 23:42.890
Another round in there.

23:42.925 --> 23:45.893
Inside, we've got prints
around the jimmied door.

23:45.928 --> 23:48.229
Same ones on the broken picture,

23:48.263 --> 23:49.230
one of the glasses,

23:49.264 --> 23:51.232
and a partial on a bullet casing.

23:51.266 --> 23:52.900
But he's not in the system.

23:52.935 --> 23:54.802
So, victims knew the killer,

23:54.837 --> 23:55.937
they had a drink with him,

23:55.971 --> 23:56.938
and then what?

23:56.972 --> 23:58.528
Something happens.

23:58.563 --> 24:00.942
Someone gets upset.

24:00.976 --> 24:03.111
A struggle.

24:03.145 --> 24:04.345
A gun comes out.

24:04.780 --> 24:06.970
Unlikely meant to go down that way,

24:08.150 --> 24:09.807
but once it did,

24:10.285 --> 24:11.809
no hesitation.

24:12.321 --> 24:14.322
Two head shots.

24:14.356 --> 24:15.590
Survivor hid under here

24:15.624 --> 24:16.791
during the killings.

24:16.825 --> 24:18.326
We got a long, black hair,

24:18.360 --> 24:19.827
blue fibres on the quilt.

24:19.862 --> 24:22.463
Prints, also not in the system.

24:22.498 --> 24:24.432
And blood on the sill.

24:24.466 --> 24:26.434
Also, some prints on the headboard

24:26.468 --> 24:28.035
don't match the others.

24:29.972 --> 24:31.639
Doesn't look like the Schumachers

24:31.673 --> 24:33.141
were staying here.

24:33.542 --> 24:34.809
Delorme.

24:39.047 --> 24:40.781
Whoever went out the window over there

24:40.816 --> 24:42.450
left footprints and blood.

24:42.484 --> 24:43.851
They ran this way.

24:43.886 --> 24:44.852
Footprints.

24:44.887 --> 24:46.621
Two sets outside the house.

24:46.655 --> 24:47.989
One belongs to the killer,

24:48.023 --> 24:49.790
boots, men size 10.

24:49.825 --> 24:52.026
The others are smaller, women's 6.

24:55.330 --> 24:57.165
So where does she go?

25:03.839 --> 25:05.540
Looks like she made it to a vehicle

25:05.574 --> 25:07.475
and escaped under fire.

25:07.509 --> 25:09.010
The rain that day helped.

25:09.044 --> 25:11.312
We've got three distinct
sets of tire tracks.

25:11.346 --> 25:12.547
So what do we have?

25:12.581 --> 25:14.015
Three vehicles,

25:14.049 --> 25:16.184
two victims, one killer.

25:16.218 --> 25:17.418
And one survivor.

25:18.687 --> 25:21.322
That's now up to five we
can put in the house.

25:21.356 --> 25:23.057
So in addition to the Sportsman Show

25:23.091 --> 25:25.203
and all the drunk and
disorderlies that come with that

25:25.227 --> 25:27.728
we've also got the ATM muggings and

25:27.763 --> 25:29.664
murders with no bodies,

25:29.698 --> 25:31.332
so I know Thanksgiving is coming up but,

25:31.366 --> 25:33.201
we're looking at overtime.

25:36.738 --> 25:37.939
Hey John.

25:38.907 --> 25:40.685
They were supposed to send
these to your house but,

25:40.709 --> 25:41.876
never happened.

25:44.379 --> 25:45.546
Great.

26:32.761 --> 26:33.728
You find them,

26:33.762 --> 26:35.296
the Schumachers?

26:35.330 --> 26:38.065
We have a warrant on their financials,

26:38.100 --> 26:40.268
we'll see if we turn up activity

26:40.302 --> 26:41.769
since the murders.

26:42.271 --> 26:43.404
Yeah.

26:43.438 --> 26:45.406
I don't think it's them.

26:45.440 --> 26:46.941
This isn't a squabble over money,

26:46.975 --> 26:48.576
isn't a jealousy thing.

26:48.610 --> 26:50.444
It's something different.

26:54.616 --> 26:55.783
Okay.

26:56.618 --> 26:57.985
Go get some rest.

26:58.020 --> 27:00.254
It's been a long day.

27:00.289 --> 27:02.123
We'll be back at it first thing.

27:04.026 --> 27:05.293
Yeah?

27:08.363 --> 27:09.630
Yup.

27:24.726 --> 27:28.046
_

27:55.510 --> 27:57.845
Jerry, it's John Cardinal.

27:57.879 --> 28:00.348
Hey. I wonder if you'd do me a favour,

28:00.382 --> 28:03.150
set me up with one of your
OPD document analysts

28:03.185 --> 28:04.352
in Toronto?

28:05.754 --> 28:07.388
No, no, it's,

28:07.422 --> 28:09.275
it's not the Island Road house thing

28:09.315 --> 28:11.225
it's something else.

28:11.259 --> 28:13.027
Just between you and me,

28:13.486 --> 28:14.953
if you don't mind.

28:16.565 --> 28:18.254
Yeah. Okay.

28:18.289 --> 28:19.533
Got it.

28:19.568 --> 28:21.202
Thanks, I'll call her.

29:07.582 --> 29:08.749
Tut-tut.

29:19.127 --> 29:20.394
Police,

29:20.429 --> 29:22.263
step away from the car.

29:23.098 --> 29:24.932
Want to tell me why that
rifle is not secured?

29:24.966 --> 29:27.435
Setting up my booth tomorrow
for the Sportsman's Show.

29:27.469 --> 29:29.437
Wanna see my permits?
I've-I've got 'em all,

29:29.471 --> 29:30.438
Come on, man.

29:30.472 --> 29:31.572
Hey, what-what the-

29:31.606 --> 29:32.740
Get back in the car.

29:32.774 --> 29:33.974
Stop!

29:36.011 --> 29:37.278
Police!

29:38.613 --> 29:39.780
Are you okay?

29:40.949 --> 29:42.116
Are you okay?

29:42.150 --> 29:44.251
I'll call the ambulance.

29:44.286 --> 29:45.486
Police!

29:58.133 --> 29:59.800
Did you see him?

30:01.703 --> 30:02.970
Are you okay?

30:05.373 --> 30:06.640
Shoot.

30:09.878 --> 30:12.847
Yeah, request for backup and medical,

30:12.881 --> 30:14.148
Parsons and First.

30:54.654 --> 30:55.788
You go home at all?

30:55.822 --> 30:57.380
A few hours.

30:59.274 --> 31:01.241
We need to concentrate
the search for the bodies

31:01.276 --> 31:02.376
on the lake.

31:02.410 --> 31:03.777
'Kay.

31:03.812 --> 31:05.379
You see that second boat there,

31:05.413 --> 31:06.613
it's gone.

31:09.389 --> 31:10.717
I'm thinking, he drags the bodies

31:10.752 --> 31:11.929
out the front door to the car,

31:11.953 --> 31:14.087
but the trunk's too small,
the bodies don't fit.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.756
We found blood on the driveway, yes.

31:15.790 --> 31:18.026
I found what I
think is blood on the dock.

31:19.260 --> 31:21.595
So you think he dumped them in the water?

31:21.629 --> 31:23.463
We need divers in the lake.

31:24.265 --> 31:26.099
I think they're down there.

31:26.467 --> 31:27.668
Okay, well,

31:28.269 --> 31:30.038
you're not gonna believe this,

31:30.638 --> 31:32.739
but I just got off the
phone with the Schumachers.

31:32.774 --> 31:35.442
They're alive and well
and on holiday in Greece.

31:35.476 --> 31:36.443
And according to them

31:36.477 --> 31:38.380
the only spare key they
own is with the realtor.

31:38.947 --> 31:41.316
I haven't been to the
Schumacher place in weeks.

31:41.649 --> 31:43.617
So is that normal for
one of your listings?

31:43.651 --> 31:45.296
Well they wanted to list it
at an unrealistic price,

31:45.320 --> 31:46.453
refused to budge.

31:46.487 --> 31:48.265
I didn't want to break my
back over dead weight.

31:48.289 --> 31:50.257
You haven't asked what this is about.

31:50.291 --> 31:52.326
Well I figured you guys
were getting to that.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.646
Somebody break in or something?

31:55.087 --> 31:58.332
We think that at least four people
illegally entered the house.

31:58.366 --> 32:00.200
At least two are dead.

32:02.762 --> 32:04.630
Are you serious?

32:04.664 --> 32:05.898
The Schumachers?

32:05.932 --> 32:06.899
They were out of town.

32:06.933 --> 32:08.100
They're fine.

32:09.936 --> 32:11.904
You tell us where you
were two nights ago?

32:11.938 --> 32:13.072
Two nights ago?

32:13.106 --> 32:15.241
I, was at my buddy Troy's place

32:15.275 --> 32:16.442
and watched the game.

32:16.476 --> 32:17.743
What's Troy's last name?

32:17.777 --> 32:19.612
Campbell, he works at the rink.

32:20.313 --> 32:21.313
So,

32:21.348 --> 32:22.481
so you're telling me that

32:22.516 --> 32:24.093
people were actually
murdered in this house?

32:24.117 --> 32:26.752
We'll need you to come in
so we can get your fingerprints,

32:26.786 --> 32:28.654
rule them out of evidence.

32:28.688 --> 32:30.623
These tires come stock with this car?

32:30.657 --> 32:32.758
Those, no, they're um,

32:32.792 --> 32:34.075
they're-they're an upgrade.

32:34.109 --> 32:35.638
Yeah, we'll compare them
to the tracks we found

32:35.662 --> 32:37.663
at the Island Road house.

32:41.835 --> 32:43.469
- Your open house.
- Mhm.

32:45.972 --> 32:47.973
How was that game by the way?

32:50.977 --> 32:52.377
Leafs tanked it again.

32:52.411 --> 32:54.780
The Richter penalty cost
them the whole thing.

32:54.814 --> 32:55.848
Yeah,

32:55.882 --> 32:57.883
that's exactly what Randall said.

33:01.154 --> 33:02.988
Great minds think alike I guess.

33:03.890 --> 33:06.125
You ever visit any of Randall's listings?

33:06.159 --> 33:07.626
Yeah, I've-I've

33:07.661 --> 33:09.495
helped him out with a place or two, yeah,

33:09.529 --> 33:10.496
clean it up.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.364
What about a house on Island Road?

33:13.567 --> 33:15.167
No, no, um,

33:15.201 --> 33:17.636
mostly just places here in town.

33:17.671 --> 33:19.505
If you think of anything else,

33:20.840 --> 33:22.241
give us a call.

33:23.043 --> 33:24.510
Yeah, will do, yeah.

33:31.017 --> 33:33.686
Yeah, I guess Randall is a big shot.

33:34.020 --> 33:36.989
So what do you think they're lying about?

33:52.287 --> 33:53.454
I know.

33:54.122 --> 33:55.322
I know.

33:55.657 --> 33:59.093
Well, just give her whatever she wants.

33:59.127 --> 34:00.694
I can't talk right now.

34:04.466 --> 34:06.333
What do you need?

34:06.367 --> 34:09.103
I need more divers
looking for these bodies.

34:09.137 --> 34:11.438
Cardinal noticed a boat
missing from the dock.

34:11.473 --> 34:13.607
We need to intensify
the Marine Unit search

34:13.641 --> 34:14.608
around Island Road.

34:14.641 --> 34:16.210
How's he doing out there?

34:16.311 --> 34:17.478
He's good.

34:18.313 --> 34:19.980
Well OPD has a sonar boat,

34:20.014 --> 34:21.447
I can put in a request for that,

34:21.483 --> 34:23.283
you have your divers and

34:23.318 --> 34:25.985
I want you to keep the
land search going now too.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.956
Yeah, I also need more overtime
cleared for ATM stakeouts.

34:28.989 --> 34:30.190
He'll hit again.

34:30.692 --> 34:31.859
Okay. You got it.

34:31.893 --> 34:32.960
Kular,

34:32.994 --> 34:35.195
I want you to ride with
Delorme into Toronto

34:35.230 --> 34:36.463
with the evidence.

34:36.498 --> 34:37.697
Happy to, D.S.

34:37.732 --> 34:40.467
Actually, I'd like to go.

34:40.502 --> 34:42.202
I didn't think you'd
want to face the drive

34:42.237 --> 34:43.303
on your first week back.

34:43.338 --> 34:44.304
No, it'll be good

34:44.339 --> 34:46.340
and we can, talk about the case.

34:47.708 --> 34:48.909
Yeah.

34:58.353 --> 35:00.053
Are you in a hurry to get back?

35:00.088 --> 35:02.022
I need to talk to Toronto Robbery.

35:02.056 --> 35:03.991
They've had a couple ATM muggings

35:04.025 --> 35:05.325
over the past few weeks,

35:05.360 --> 35:06.326
same MO.

35:06.361 --> 35:07.361
Do you want to come?

35:07.395 --> 35:09.229
No. I should check on Kelly,

35:10.765 --> 35:12.599
see how she's doing.

35:14.369 --> 35:15.536
Yeah.

35:15.870 --> 35:17.704
So I'll meet you here in a couple hours.

35:17.739 --> 35:18.939
Yeah.

35:25.380 --> 35:26.880
Well it all came from an inkjet,

35:26.915 --> 35:28.715
I can tell you that much.

35:28.750 --> 35:30.350
This is good, take a look.

35:30.385 --> 35:32.019
What am I looking for?

35:32.053 --> 35:34.054
Maybe how you find whoever wrote these.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.724
See the H's and the T's?

35:37.759 --> 35:40.360
There's splotches in the right angles.

35:40.395 --> 35:41.361
It's in all the cards.

35:41.396 --> 35:42.529
A printer flaw.

35:42.564 --> 35:43.697
So whoever has this printer,

35:43.731 --> 35:44.698
Not that simple.

35:44.732 --> 35:45.933
It's a cartridge flaw,

35:45.967 --> 35:47.534
which means as soon as the ink runs out

35:47.569 --> 35:48.702
he gets a new cartridge

35:48.736 --> 35:50.080
you can't pin him to these anymore.

35:50.104 --> 35:51.782
I need to find him
before the ink runs out?

35:51.806 --> 35:53.640
I'll print up the analysis.

35:54.142 --> 35:55.976
You said there was something else?

35:58.246 --> 35:59.413
Yeah.

36:02.584 --> 36:05.385
So this Catherine killed herself?

36:05.420 --> 36:06.553
It appears so.

36:06.588 --> 36:08.422
But you're not convinced.

36:09.424 --> 36:10.591
No, I am not.

36:11.426 --> 36:12.593
Okay.

36:19.834 --> 36:20.901
Dear John,

36:21.496 --> 36:23.403
By the time you read this

36:23.438 --> 36:26.406
I will have hurt you
beyond all forgiveness.

36:26.441 --> 36:28.575
Please know how much I love you,

36:28.610 --> 36:30.444
never more so than in this moment.

36:30.478 --> 36:31.912
If there had been any other way.'

36:33.648 --> 36:34.848
Jesus, that's grim.

36:36.951 --> 36:38.318
Poor girl.

36:38.353 --> 36:39.319
Worse for her family,

36:39.354 --> 36:40.988
I need to know,

36:42.457 --> 36:44.458
I need to know if the note was written

36:44.492 --> 36:46.103
with the same pen as the
rest of the journal.

36:46.127 --> 36:47.160
And when it was written

36:47.195 --> 36:49.096
in relation to the last entry.

36:49.130 --> 36:50.841
You see this page here with
the birthday reminder?

36:50.865 --> 36:54.001
It looks to me as if the note
is the previous torn out page.

36:54.035 --> 36:55.836
Yeah, yeah it does.

36:55.870 --> 36:59.039
Give me a few minutes, I'll let
you know what I can find out.

37:08.383 --> 37:09.650
Um.

37:10.051 --> 37:12.786
So, I brushed over

37:12.820 --> 37:15.122
the birthday reminder and toner.

37:15.156 --> 37:17.291
And as you can see

37:17.325 --> 37:20.527
the ink is on the indentations
from the suicide note.

37:20.561 --> 37:22.963
So the note came before the list?

37:22.997 --> 37:25.032
It's weird. Writing a suicide note,

37:25.066 --> 37:27.334
then turning the page over
to write a to-do list.

37:27.368 --> 37:28.969
It doesn't make any sense.

37:29.003 --> 37:30.370
That's what I thought too.

37:30.405 --> 37:31.505
But, on the other hand,

37:31.539 --> 37:33.707
she did write a suicide note so

37:33.741 --> 37:35.542
it seems like she was intending to do it.

37:35.576 --> 37:36.810
Thank you.

37:36.844 --> 37:37.811
This,

37:37.845 --> 37:39.046
this helps.

37:41.349 --> 37:42.549
Hey,

37:43.017 --> 37:44.495
the John in the note and that journal

37:44.519 --> 37:47.821
- that's not-
- I'll say hi to Jerry for you.

37:47.855 --> 37:49.056
Thanks again.

37:51.726 --> 37:52.926
No problem.

38:08.543 --> 38:10.377
So, did you manage to see Kelly?

38:14.115 --> 38:17.050
You ever hear anything
about the Scriver case?

38:18.052 --> 38:21.388
Were you looking at cold cases
while you were on leave?

38:21.622 --> 38:23.090
Thirty years ago,

38:23.124 --> 38:25.859
Frank and Dorothy Scriver,
and their daughter Amy,

38:25.893 --> 38:29.096
disappeared from Black Lake.
Just vanished.

38:29.130 --> 38:31.531
What do they think happened?

38:31.566 --> 38:33.033
Signs of struggle.

38:33.067 --> 38:35.402
Blood from all three in the house.

38:35.436 --> 38:38.271
But they never found any bodies.

38:38.306 --> 38:39.906
Not on land anyway,

38:39.941 --> 38:41.942
and back then the lake
was too deep to drag.

38:43.578 --> 38:46.546
Water is a good
place to cover up a murder.

38:46.581 --> 38:49.082
You were right to focus
our search on the lake.

38:49.117 --> 38:51.118
But it doesn't make sense with this one.

38:52.420 --> 38:53.587
I mean,

38:53.621 --> 38:56.556
why sink the bodies and leave
all that evidence behind?

38:56.591 --> 38:58.592
Unless he just didn't want
us to ID the victims.

39:00.128 --> 39:01.294
But the woman upstairs.

39:01.329 --> 39:03.163
I still don't get that.

39:05.133 --> 39:07.134
And where is she now?

39:07.168 --> 39:09.002
Why hasn't she called us?

39:36.831 --> 39:38.031
Sam.

41:07.377 --> 41:08.644
John.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.267
You need to wake up.

41:29.799 --> 41:30.966
Yeah?

41:35.404 --> 41:36.571
Okay.

41:51.575 --> 41:53.709
Divers found the boat an hour ago.

41:53.744 --> 41:55.578
They're bringing it up now.

41:56.513 --> 41:58.481
Must have taken the bodies out.

41:58.515 --> 42:00.349
Swum back to shore.

42:30.547 --> 42:31.714
Okay,

42:32.716 --> 42:34.550
let's bring them in.

42:35.305 --> 42:41.277
