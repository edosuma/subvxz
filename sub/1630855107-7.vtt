[tender, wondrous music playing]

48:38.332 --> 48:39.416
[Jepp] Oh.

48:42.753 --> 48:44.254
Why does it look like this?

48:46.924 --> 48:48.508
It's the Northern Lights.

48:50.135 --> 48:52.387
We're not supposed
to be able to see it here.

48:53.764 --> 48:55.265
We're too far south.

48:57.017 --> 48:58.727
Where would you normally see it?

49:00.729 --> 49:02.356
Places that are way too cold.

49:07.152 --> 49:08.403
Like Alaska?

49:12.074 --> 49:13.075
[Jepp] Mmm.

49:15.452 --> 49:17.454
[motorbike approaching]

49:17.454 --> 49:18.455
Jepp?

49:19.665 --> 49:20.666
Someone's coming.

49:20.666 --> 49:22.501
[low, distressing music playing]

49:23.794 --> 49:24.628
I heard it too.

49:26.421 --> 49:27.589
Come on.

49:40.978 --> 49:41.979
[rider grunts]

49:43.230 --> 49:44.356
Tiger!

49:48.193 --> 49:49.027
[Tiger grunts]

49:49.027 --> 49:51.613
[dark, threatening music builds]

49:51.613 --> 49:53.573
[struggling] A...

49:53.573 --> 49:54.658
Abbot's coming.

49:59.788 --> 50:00.789
Run!

50:10.424 --> 50:12.426
[helicopter whirring]

50:22.602 --> 50:23.812
Next stop,

50:24.896 --> 50:26.398
Yellowstone!

50:32.779 --> 50:34.114
Let's finish this.

50:36.700 --> 50:38.702
[tense, martial outro music playing]
