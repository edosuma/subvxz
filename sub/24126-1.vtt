WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.958
a friend of mine

00:08.583 --> 00:11.416
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.000 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:20.958
I know he's out there

00:24.583 --> 00:28.083
we're so adventurous

00:28.083 --> 00:31.208
and again

00:31.208 --> 00:34.875
and there's nobody home

00:34.875 --> 00:37.958
to count on a friend

00:37.958 --> 00:41.458
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.500 --> 00:45.583
take me, please?

00:45.583 --> 00:48.458
I got to be there

00:50.750 --> 00:54.166
Winnie the Pooh

01:11.583 --> 01:14.333
- We're under attack!
- We are?

01:14.333 --> 01:16.125
Take that, you barnacle!

01:16.125 --> 01:17.750
Avast there!

01:17.750 --> 01:20.250
First Mate Pooh,
take the wheel!

01:25.875 --> 01:30.000
Oh, it seems to have
been taken already.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
All hands on deck!

01:32.000 --> 01:33.416
Lay the top sail!

01:33.416 --> 01:35.375
Man the bull works!

01:35.375 --> 01:38.166
A walnut. Hmm.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.000
This reminds me of something,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.500
although I can't quite
remember what it is.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.166
We shall fight to the last man!

01:46.166 --> 01:49.000
And the last bear!

01:49.000 --> 01:51.083
Throw out the anchor, Pooh!

01:54.875 --> 01:57.500
Oh, bother.
Another walnut.

02:00.250 --> 02:03.583
First Mate Pooh,
we must protect
the treasure map.

02:03.583 --> 02:05.583
Treasure map?

02:05.583 --> 02:07.375
Piles of gold.

02:07.375 --> 02:09.375
Oh!

02:09.375 --> 02:11.083
Mountains of silver.

02:11.083 --> 02:12.291
Silver!

02:13.708 --> 02:16.500
We have to keep it safe
at all costs.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.958
Well, then perhaps
we should get some help?

02:19.958 --> 02:21.958
Good idea,
First Mate Pooh.

02:23.125 --> 02:25.083
Let's put a note in a bottle,

02:25.083 --> 02:27.708
and whoever finds it
will come and save us.

02:29.125 --> 02:30.708
Write a message
on the map.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.625
What does it say, Pooh Bear?

02:38.625 --> 02:42.708
I don't know
because I can't read.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.083
By using very small bait,

02:54.083 --> 02:57.750
I can be sure I won't catch
too very large a fish.

03:08.458 --> 03:10.458
Oh, no.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.166
Oh, dear.

03:33.291 --> 03:34.875
Oh, my.
For such a very small bottle,

03:34.875 --> 03:37.458
you put up
a very large struggle.

03:37.458 --> 03:40.291
Oh, this must be
an important message.

03:40.291 --> 03:42.625
I better ask Pooh what
he thinks all this means.

03:46.125 --> 03:47.875
Oh, dear.

03:55.125 --> 03:57.125
Follow that bottle!

03:59.625 --> 04:02.458
Hmm. Everybody's somewhere
other than here.

04:02.458 --> 04:04.125
I wonder where that is.

04:04.125 --> 04:07.875
- Say! A note in a bottle!

04:07.875 --> 04:11.125
- Nobody needs one of these

04:11.125 --> 04:13.458
unless they're macarooned
on a dessert isle!

04:13.458 --> 04:16.625
This must mean I'm lost.

04:16.625 --> 04:19.166
And I didn't even know
I was missing.

04:19.166 --> 04:21.333
What am I gonna do?

04:21.333 --> 04:23.208
How am I gonna find me?

04:23.208 --> 04:25.708
I can't go on much longer.

04:25.708 --> 04:27.375
I'm a goner.

04:27.375 --> 04:28.708
Done for.

04:28.708 --> 04:32.708
-

04:32.708 --> 04:36.375
Water! Water!

04:38.333 --> 04:42.166
Oh, Pooh, I found a bottle,
and it had a note in it.

04:42.166 --> 04:46.625
Why, that's very interesting,
Piglet.

04:46.625 --> 04:49.833
Christopher Robin
was just speaking

04:49.833 --> 04:53.333
of bottles and messages
and such.

04:53.333 --> 04:55.458
Oh, my!

04:55.458 --> 04:57.875
I'll bet the note's
from Christopher Robin.

04:57.875 --> 04:59.708
He must be in trouble.

04:59.708 --> 05:02.875
We shall have to get Owl
to read it for us.

05:02.875 --> 05:05.208
But, Pooh,
I don't have it anymore.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.125
Then we'd better hurry.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.583
Bunny boy, I can't go on.

05:11.583 --> 05:14.416
You gotta tell me.
Where am I?

05:14.416 --> 05:17.000
Why, Tigger, you're right here.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.458
And so I am!

05:19.458 --> 05:21.500
Guess I won't be needing this.

05:24.083 --> 05:26.333
- What was that?
-

05:28.333 --> 05:30.750
Can you read it, long-ears?

05:30.750 --> 05:34.375
Why, this is so simple,
even Owl could read it.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.000
Then let's go get Owl.

05:41.125 --> 05:45.083
Oh, why, Pooh Bear, of course
I'd be happy to read the note,

05:45.083 --> 05:49.416
- but first I'd have to see it.
- But it's gone--

05:49.416 --> 05:51.750
Good thing we got another one.
Came in a bottle.

05:51.750 --> 05:55.083
Pooh! That's it!
That's the bottle!

05:55.083 --> 05:57.125
Aha! Oho!

06:03.458 --> 06:06.208
Say, this reminds me
of something,

06:06.208 --> 06:08.416
but I disremember what.

06:08.416 --> 06:12.250
-

06:12.250 --> 06:14.833
Well, what does it say?

06:14.833 --> 06:18.375
This clearly is written
in a forgotten language
of the ancients,

06:18.375 --> 06:20.833
likely thousands of years old.

06:20.833 --> 06:23.000
Judging by the script,

06:23.000 --> 06:25.833
something from
the Lower Lumbar region.

06:25.833 --> 06:29.208
But Owl, I think it was sent
by Christopher Robin,

06:29.208 --> 06:31.208
because he's in trouble.

06:31.208 --> 06:36.708
In that case,
this is most definitely
a recipe for coconut cream pie.

06:36.708 --> 06:39.125
It's a disaster! An apostrophe!

06:39.125 --> 06:43.000
There's no telling what kind
of terrible trouble the poor
guy's in.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.291
Why he could be in the clutches
of kid-eatin' cannibals.

06:46.291 --> 06:49.458
There are no cannibals
in the Hundred Acre Wood.

06:49.458 --> 06:53.250
Then probably
it's kid-eatin' sharks!

06:53.250 --> 06:57.375
Yeah, Tigger sharks,
the stripedy kind.

06:59.458 --> 07:02.583
Wait a second.
There are no sharks
in the Hundred Acre Wood.

07:02.583 --> 07:05.875
Wrong time of year.

07:05.875 --> 07:09.875
Then it's definitely spookables.

07:09.875 --> 07:11.708
Oh, dear.

07:11.708 --> 07:14.166
Poor Christopher Robin.
What can we do?

07:14.166 --> 07:16.833
We'll send him
a message in a bottle.

07:16.833 --> 07:19.583
What good is that going
to do, Pooh?

07:19.583 --> 07:22.166
We'll follow the bottle to him.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.500
Let me launch it for you,
buddy bear.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.291
It's what tiggers do best.

07:34.833 --> 07:37.166
- A walnut.
- A walnut?

07:37.166 --> 07:40.416
- It's the pack rats!
- Of course!

07:40.416 --> 07:43.083
That's what the walnuts
reminded me of.

07:43.083 --> 07:45.500
Come on!
We gotta get that bottle back.

07:45.500 --> 07:48.000
Christopher Robin's
depending on us.

07:49.500 --> 07:53.416
- There they are!
- Follow that bottle!

07:58.416 --> 08:01.208
There's no escaping now!

08:01.208 --> 08:03.708
You might as well
hand over that bottle.

08:03.708 --> 08:06.000
Yes, if you please.

08:07.208 --> 08:08.250
Hey!

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I got it!

08:14.000 --> 08:15.416
I got it.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.083
I got it.

08:22.083 --> 08:23.958
Oh, bother.

08:29.833 --> 08:32.125
Oh, my!

08:32.125 --> 08:34.416
It's "bustafried."

08:47.458 --> 08:49.458
Oh, thank you.

08:49.458 --> 08:52.125
But without a bottle,

08:52.125 --> 08:55.708
we can never use this
to rescue Christopher Robin.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.458
Aww!

09:14.125 --> 09:15.583
Pack rat: ta-da!

09:20.583 --> 09:22.583
Thank you, pack rats.

09:22.583 --> 09:26.000
Now, if you wouldn't mind,
Mr. Bottle,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.208
we'd like to see
Christopher Robin.

09:28.208 --> 09:30.833
So could we please get started?

09:30.833 --> 09:32.458
And please hurry.

09:32.458 --> 09:35.416
Say, this tub's great,

09:35.416 --> 09:38.208
as long as the water stays
on the outside.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.000
Oh, dear.

09:55.458 --> 09:57.708
I think we've seen the worst.

09:57.708 --> 09:59.500
All right, Rabbit.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.583
It's right up there
ahead of us.

10:11.083 --> 10:13.875
Now that the bottle
has lost us,

10:13.875 --> 10:17.083
we'll never save
Christopher Robin.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.708
Christopher Robin:
Oh, here you all are.

10:18.708 --> 10:21.291
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

10:21.291 --> 10:22.875
I got your message.

10:22.875 --> 10:24.958
There you are,
Christopher Robin!

10:24.958 --> 10:27.000
- We found you!
- We did it!

10:27.000 --> 10:30.875
Christopher Robin,
we saved you!

10:30.875 --> 10:32.583
Saved me, Pooh?

10:32.583 --> 10:34.708
Oh, yeah, from the cannibals.

10:34.708 --> 10:37.708
And the tigger sharks
and spookables.

10:37.708 --> 10:39.583
Sounds pretty exciting.

10:39.583 --> 10:41.083
Sorry I missed it.

10:41.083 --> 10:43.208
You mean you weren't
in any trouble?

10:43.208 --> 10:45.583
Oh, bother.

10:47.250 --> 10:50.083
Oh, but I was in trouble.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.458
You were?

10:51.458 --> 10:54.708
Oh, yes.
You came just in time.

10:54.708 --> 10:56.708
- We did?
- You see?

10:56.708 --> 10:58.750
I picked these flowers
for my mother.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.333
And I don't have anything
to put them in.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.125
But this will do perfectly.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.750
It does look very nice.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.416
Why, yes, very nice, indeed.

11:11.416 --> 11:14.708
I'm so glad we could help you,
Christopher Robin.

11:14.708 --> 11:18.416
Yeah! Saving Christopher Robins
is what we do best, you know.

11:19.625 --> 11:22.125
Sure. If it hadn't been for you,

11:22.125 --> 11:24.750
I never would have been able
to give Mom these.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.458
Walnuts?

11:26.458 --> 11:28.458
Well...

11:28.458 --> 11:30.083
Mom like these, too.

11:30.083 --> 11:35.875
Hmm. Those walnuts
remind me of something.

11:43.708 --> 11:47.458
28, 29, 30...

11:47.458 --> 11:50.000
31, 32...

11:50.000 --> 11:51.875
32?

11:51.875 --> 11:55.458
I had 33 tomatoes yesterday!

11:55.458 --> 11:59.750
That can only mean crows!

11:59.750 --> 12:02.833
Oh, no! My beautiful garden!

12:02.833 --> 12:05.833
- My poor vegetables!
-

12:05.833 --> 12:08.833
Take that,
you vegetable nappers!

12:08.833 --> 12:10.375
And that! And that!

12:15.000 --> 12:18.708
Now I've got you,
you feather brains.

12:18.708 --> 12:20.708
OOH! HELP!

12:20.708 --> 12:22.333
- Let me out of here!

12:22.333 --> 12:26.000
Oh, dear.
Look, Pooh.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.583
Oh, my.

12:27.583 --> 12:29.833
Uh, excuse me,

12:29.833 --> 12:32.291
but have you seen a rabbit
around here

12:32.291 --> 12:36.166
with a very loud voice?

12:36.166 --> 12:37.708
It's me, Pooh.

12:37.708 --> 12:41.458
Oh, we thought you were
in terrible trouble.

12:41.458 --> 12:43.375
It was those crows!

12:43.375 --> 12:46.875
- They're after my garden again.
- Oh, yes.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.875
This reminds me of the occasion

12:48.875 --> 12:51.833
when my uncle Aloysius
had his tail feathers stolen

12:51.833 --> 12:54.708
and couldn't sit down
without sneezing.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.708
I haven't got the time
to talk about

12:56.708 --> 12:59.250
your nonexistent relatives

12:59.250 --> 13:02.000
with those dive-bombing
delinquents around.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.250
Hut, two, three, four.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.958
My relatives don't exist?

13:08.958 --> 13:10.000
Oh, my word.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.625
If you'll excuse me,

13:11.625 --> 13:14.583
I have to go reexamine
my family tree.

13:17.250 --> 13:20.583
Hmm. My relatives are
as real as anyone's.

13:20.583 --> 13:24.000
Just because I haven't heard
from them for years and years,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.375
doesn't mean they don't exist,
does it?

13:28.875 --> 13:31.708
Perhaps that's one
of my relations now.

13:31.708 --> 13:36.208
Why, hello, Pooh, Piglet.

13:36.208 --> 13:39.250
I'm very happy to see you.

13:39.250 --> 13:44.583
You haven't seen any owls
wandering about, have you?

13:44.583 --> 13:46.208
Why, no, Owl, we haven't.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.000
That's right.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.416
You're the only owl
around here.

13:50.416 --> 13:52.375
Aren't you?

13:52.375 --> 13:56.583
Oh, that's what
I was afraid of.

13:56.583 --> 13:58.708
I think he's very sad, Pooh.

13:58.708 --> 14:00.333
He wants to see his family.

14:00.333 --> 14:03.625
Perhaps his family wants
to see him, too!

14:03.625 --> 14:05.833
Wouldn't that be nice.

14:05.833 --> 14:08.625
A family reunion for Owl.

14:08.625 --> 14:12.750
A family reunion for me?

14:12.750 --> 14:16.958
And to think you knew where
to find my relatives all along.

14:16.958 --> 14:19.125
I did? Do?

14:19.125 --> 14:21.875
Ooh, I must get busy
and prepare.

14:21.875 --> 14:24.875
This is going to be wonderful.

14:24.875 --> 14:27.708
This reminds me
of the coming out party...

14:27.708 --> 14:31.458
Pooh, do you really know
where Owl's relations are?

14:31.458 --> 14:34.416
Well, since I know
they're not here,

14:34.416 --> 14:36.958
the rest should be easy.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.291
What exactly are we doing,
Pooh?

14:41.291 --> 14:44.875
Sending invitations
to the reunion, of course.

14:44.875 --> 14:48.958
The balloon will carry the
invitations to Owl's relatives.

14:48.958 --> 14:51.333
Air mail.

14:51.333 --> 14:54.458
I'm going to help Owl get ready
for their visit.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.000
Good idea, Piglet.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.500
I shall wait here
for the guests to arrive.

15:04.958 --> 15:08.958
I suppose Owl's relations
must be very shy.

15:08.958 --> 15:12.833
or perhaps I didn't use
enough postage.

15:12.833 --> 15:16.625
I suppose I'll just have
to invite them in person.

15:20.750 --> 15:23.625
Beat it, you flying felons!

15:23.625 --> 15:28.000
Well, I'll be ready for those
feather dusters next time.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.708
Hut, two, three, four.

15:33.708 --> 15:36.416
Oh, this is an awful lot
of food, Owl.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.708
When owls get together
for a hoot,

15:40.708 --> 15:44.166
it pays to have plenty
of the proper cuisine on hand.

15:44.166 --> 15:46.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.958
- Pooh: So here you are!
-

15:47.958 --> 15:50.583
I've been expecting you!

15:51.958 --> 15:56.208
You are Owl's relations,
aren't you?

15:59.500 --> 16:02.333
Owl will be so pleased!

16:02.333 --> 16:06.583
Oh, thank you, Pooh,
for finding my relatives.

16:06.583 --> 16:10.000
But are you sure
these aren't crows?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.375
Nonsense, Piglet.

16:11.375 --> 16:13.583
Why would Pooh invite crows

16:13.583 --> 16:15.708
to my family reunion?

16:15.708 --> 16:18.583
Their "owlness"
is unmistakable.

16:18.583 --> 16:22.000
The dignity, bearing,
good fellowship,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.583
- taste--
-

16:24.583 --> 16:27.416
Of course,
I'm sure a refresher course

16:27.416 --> 16:30.000
in table manners
might not be amiss.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.250
Whoa!

16:34.250 --> 16:35.875
Well, I'm sure you
and your relations

16:35.875 --> 16:37.208
have a lot to talk about.

16:37.208 --> 16:38.958
Whoops!

16:38.958 --> 16:43.375
Yes, Owl, we hope you'll
all be very happy together.

16:43.375 --> 16:45.250
Yes, I hope so, too.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.166
I say!

16:50.166 --> 16:53.083
I do believe
this is most improper.

16:53.083 --> 16:54.625
-

16:54.625 --> 16:57.125
But then the guest
is always right.

16:58.833 --> 17:02.750
Well, it's been a very long day
of getting reacquainted.

17:02.750 --> 17:06.458
I'm sure we're all right ready
for a good night's sleep.

17:08.833 --> 17:12.250
No? Perhaps a bedtime story?

17:14.250 --> 17:15.583
Well, then what is it you want?

17:16.875 --> 17:19.375
A midnight snack?

17:19.375 --> 17:23.875
I'm afraid your latest repast
has totally depleted the latter.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.416
We're out of food.

17:25.416 --> 17:27.208
But we can get some
from Rabbit

17:27.208 --> 17:29.000
when I introduce you
to him in the morning.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I can't wait

17:31.000 --> 17:34.875
for him to meet some
of my relations.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.333
I don't know why you want
to meet Rabbit's garden

17:37.333 --> 17:39.333
before you meet Rabbit.

17:42.708 --> 17:46.000
I've heard of presenting
flowers when introduced,

17:46.000 --> 17:48.458
but vegetables
is something entirely new.

17:48.458 --> 17:51.708
And from his own garden, too.

17:51.708 --> 17:56.416
-

17:56.416 --> 17:59.958
Aha! I've caught
those thieves red-handed!

17:59.958 --> 18:04.750
- Owl!
- Why, Rabbit,
how fortuitous.

18:04.750 --> 18:08.458
I was just dropping by
to introduce my relatives.

18:09.833 --> 18:12.833
Those pests are with you?

18:12.833 --> 18:15.166
- But-- But--
- And I really must tell you,

18:15.166 --> 18:17.625
I'm not at all impressed
with your hospitality.

18:17.625 --> 18:20.500
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:20.500 --> 18:23.250
I must return to my guests.

18:23.250 --> 18:27.166
Relations? Guests? Crows?

18:27.166 --> 18:29.375
What was all that noise,
Rabbit?

18:29.375 --> 18:32.000
Owl was here with his relatives,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.458
but they were crows.

18:34.458 --> 18:37.291
Oh, Pooh, I knew it all along.

18:37.291 --> 18:41.333
Oh, my, do you realize
what this means?

18:41.333 --> 18:44.000
- Owl's a crow?
- No.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.125
But those relatives
of his certainly are.

18:47.125 --> 18:51.083
There's only thing to do
in a situation like this.

18:51.083 --> 18:53.583
What do you suppose
that one thing is, Pooh?

18:53.583 --> 18:56.875
If crows,
which Owl thinks are owls,

18:56.875 --> 18:58.500
caused the problem,

18:58.500 --> 19:00.416
the perhaps Owl's,

19:00.416 --> 19:04.250
which crows think are owls,
will solve it.

19:04.250 --> 19:07.291
Oh, Pooh,
that's a very good idea...

19:07.291 --> 19:08.583
I think.

19:24.625 --> 19:26.291
Woot!

19:27.458 --> 19:28.958
Um, hoot!

19:28.958 --> 19:30.708
Hello, Owl.

19:30.708 --> 19:32.708
It's me, your cousin Dexter.

19:36.291 --> 19:37.875
And your--

19:37.875 --> 19:40.708
Hoot! Hoot!

19:40.708 --> 19:42.416
...Uncle Torbet.

19:42.416 --> 19:46.583
How wonderful!
More family for the reunion.

19:48.458 --> 19:51.166
By all means do come in.

19:56.708 --> 19:58.375
Oh, bother.

20:01.625 --> 20:03.083
Oh, dear.

20:05.708 --> 20:09.500
Oh, I see. That's splendid.
A delightful prank.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.875
- Quite the proper spirit and--
-

20:11.875 --> 20:13.583
More guests?

20:13.583 --> 20:17.750
Oh, well, the more, the merrier.
That's my motto.

20:20.375 --> 20:23.000
I say! Who have we here?

20:23.000 --> 20:26.583
Surely you haven't forgotten
your own uncle Torbet

20:26.583 --> 20:30.208
and Aunt Ophelia
and your cousin Dexter.

20:30.208 --> 20:33.458
My word, you do look familiar.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.166
Yikes!

20:47.875 --> 20:49.083
Uh-oh.

20:59.416 --> 21:03.333
My word, never a moment's rest
for those three.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.875
Off to some other party,
no doubt.

21:05.875 --> 21:09.333
There's no escape now,
you imposters!

21:09.333 --> 21:14.000
You can't fool me with
those ridiculous owl disguises.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.583
Do you think
I was born yesterday?

21:16.583 --> 21:19.333
Did we miss Rabbit's birthday?

21:25.458 --> 21:28.250
That Rabbit reminds me
of Uncle Tucker,

21:28.250 --> 21:31.500
the time he got his beak caught
in the corn crib.

21:31.500 --> 21:35.166
Uncle Tucker? Corn crib?

21:35.166 --> 21:40.125
I'm very glad you arrived in
time for Owl's family reunion,
Rabbit.

21:40.125 --> 21:44.500
- Family reunion?
- Isn't it wonderful?

21:44.500 --> 21:48.375
Now we have four times
as many stories to listen to.

21:48.375 --> 21:51.250
Yes, wonderful.

21:51.250 --> 21:54.125
Owl: That reminds me
of the time Uncle Tucker

21:54.125 --> 21:56.708
spent the summer
in that cuckoo's nest.

21:56.708 --> 21:59.250
He never did get over that.

21:59.250 --> 22:02.333
But he builds
wonderful clocks now.

22:02.333 --> 22:05.875
Such a pity none of us
can tell time.

22:05.875 --> 22:08.250
All: That reminds me
of the time...
