WEBVTT

00:05.246 --> 00:08.749
Previously on The Truth About
the Harry Quebert Affair...

00:08.849 --> 00:10.070
We found fingerprints
on the gas can,

00:10.170 --> 00:12.172
but no match...

00:13.173 --> 00:15.595
which means it was someone
with no police record.

00:15.696 --> 00:16.997
No record?

00:17.097 --> 00:18.478
What happened to your face?

00:18.578 --> 00:20.440
I had an accident.

00:20.540 --> 00:22.081
Why would Stern go
through all this mess,

00:22.181 --> 00:23.683
maybe even kill someone,

00:23.783 --> 00:25.484
just to protect Luther?

00:25.585 --> 00:27.526
I'm still trying
to figure that part out.

00:27.626 --> 00:28.607
[boys shout]
Fuckin' redneck!

00:28.707 --> 00:29.768
[bottle smashes]

00:29.869 --> 00:32.171
[jeering and shouting,
heavy blows thudding]

00:32.271 --> 00:34.533
These are all his paintings?

00:34.633 --> 00:37.055
Your brother, he, uh,
he had a thing for blondes?

00:37.155 --> 00:38.897
[Jenny screams]
Oh, my God!

00:38.997 --> 00:40.698
Luther, you scared me!
Jeez...

00:40.799 --> 00:42.180
The results are in.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.821
The handwriting
on the manuscript

00:43.921 --> 00:44.782
is Luther Caleb's.

00:44.882 --> 00:46.063
[Perry]: Check your email.

00:46.163 --> 00:47.505
What the hell is this?

00:47.605 --> 00:50.227
Nola's mother died in 1966,

00:50.327 --> 00:51.909
nine years before
Nola disappeared.

00:52.009 --> 00:53.830
She was beaten by a dead woman.

00:53.931 --> 00:55.872
Your book is a pile of crap.

00:55.972 --> 00:57.474
[Pastor Lewis]:
The night of the fire

00:57.574 --> 01:00.076
did not go quite the way

01:00.176 --> 01:04.020
David Kellergan told the police.

01:05.661 --> 01:07.603
[Kellergan]:
I gotta tell you something.

01:07.703 --> 01:10.886
Mommy was in our bedroom
when the fire happened.

01:10.986 --> 01:12.488
I know.

01:12.588 --> 01:14.249
She was wicked.

01:14.349 --> 01:16.571
She needed to be dead,

01:16.671 --> 01:18.693
so I put the curtains on fire.

01:18.793 --> 01:20.054
[Lewis]: That little girl

01:20.155 --> 01:25.179
started to believe that
she herself was her mother.

01:25.279 --> 01:28.022
She was punishing herself,

01:28.122 --> 01:29.503
whipping herself,

01:29.603 --> 01:32.826
plunging her head
into a bath of icy water...

01:32.926 --> 01:34.668
[spluttering]

01:34.768 --> 01:38.551
Her father couldn't
take any more,

01:38.652 --> 01:43.256
so he decided
to move them both far away.

01:48.661 --> 01:52.905
[♪♪♪♪♪]

02:48.395 --> 02:50.678
[knocking]

02:55.282 --> 02:56.823
Get a warrant,

02:56.923 --> 02:59.025
or get off my property.

02:59.125 --> 03:00.867
I think you should
let us in, Reverend.

03:00.967 --> 03:02.909
It's better if we can
all come inside

03:03.009 --> 03:05.751
and talk calmly.

03:05.851 --> 03:07.193
Yeah, We know about
what happened in Alabama

03:07.293 --> 03:08.594
in 1966.

03:08.694 --> 03:10.876
We know about the fire.

03:10.976 --> 03:12.277
You know nothing.

03:12.377 --> 03:15.540
We talked
to Pastor Lewis.

03:25.309 --> 03:26.370
Why didn't you try
to get her help?

03:26.470 --> 03:27.731
See a doctor?

03:27.832 --> 03:31.014
I was afraid.

03:31.115 --> 03:33.257
I was afraid
they'd take her away

03:33.357 --> 03:35.419
and lock her up.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.300
[crying]

03:37.400 --> 03:38.862
And so
you had him...

03:38.962 --> 03:40.743
you had him
exorcise her?

03:40.843 --> 03:43.826
I had no choice.

03:43.926 --> 03:46.028
Pastor Lewis said I had to,

03:46.128 --> 03:49.331
or he'd tell the police
what she'd done.

03:51.854 --> 03:55.157
It only made
my poor sweet girl sicker.

03:55.257 --> 03:59.801
She started punishing herself...

03:59.901 --> 04:01.643
as her mother.

04:01.743 --> 04:03.925
And so you
left Alabama,

04:04.025 --> 04:07.168
hoping the move would
wipe the slate clean.

04:07.268 --> 04:09.770
Mm-hm. [sobbing]

04:09.870 --> 04:13.053
And it did at first.

04:13.153 --> 04:16.416
The outbursts
were less frequent.

04:16.516 --> 04:19.919
Her memory of the whole thing
seemed to be fading...

04:23.202 --> 04:27.046
Till the summer
Harry Quebert appeared.

04:31.450 --> 04:36.715
That's when she started having
violent fits again.

04:36.815 --> 04:38.116
At the time, I didn't know why.

04:38.216 --> 04:39.757
[sobbing]

04:39.858 --> 04:41.759
It was a horrible sight

04:41.859 --> 04:44.822
to see her do that
to herself.

04:46.103 --> 04:50.147
[water running]

04:53.590 --> 04:55.592
[Nola, as her mother]:
You know why I'm doing this...

04:58.194 --> 05:02.859
[Nola]: So that
I can go to heaven.

05:02.959 --> 05:05.681
[As her mother]: You wanna be
an angel, don't you?

05:12.127 --> 05:15.650
[As Nola]:
I'm sorry I'm a wicked girl.

05:17.252 --> 05:19.434
[As her mother]:
You're not wicked.

05:19.534 --> 05:22.176
Penance is a blessing.

05:23.297 --> 05:24.879
[As Nola]: No, Mother!

05:24.979 --> 05:26.120
No, Mother, please!

05:26.220 --> 05:27.281
Please, Mother, no!

05:27.381 --> 05:29.383
No!

05:31.545 --> 05:34.007
[muffled screaming]

05:34.107 --> 05:35.408
[gasping for breath]

05:35.509 --> 05:37.510
[sobbing]

05:44.877 --> 05:47.119
She started reliving
her exorcism.

05:53.605 --> 05:56.788
What happened
on that day she disappeared?

05:56.888 --> 05:58.890
On August 30th?

06:00.572 --> 06:02.193
The anniversary of the fire.

06:02.293 --> 06:03.955
[gasping]

06:04.055 --> 06:06.117
Of Louisa's death.

06:06.217 --> 06:08.219
[pill rattles]

06:16.346 --> 06:19.249
She had a terrible fit.

06:19.349 --> 06:23.212
One of the worst ever.

06:23.312 --> 06:24.854
I tried to calm her,

06:24.954 --> 06:26.215
but nothing worked,

06:26.315 --> 06:28.577
so I...

06:28.677 --> 06:32.901
I hid out in the garage,
and I...

06:33.001 --> 06:35.864
worked on the damn motorcycle.

06:35.964 --> 06:37.946
[chuckles ruefully]

06:38.046 --> 06:41.909
I turned up the music
as loud as it would go.

06:42.010 --> 06:42.870
[jazz music blares]

06:42.970 --> 06:45.333
[Nola screaming]

06:50.137 --> 06:52.139
[Nola's screams echo and fade]

06:54.581 --> 06:56.443
Later,

06:56.543 --> 06:57.964
when I went
into her room,

06:58.064 --> 07:00.486
she wasn't there.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.567
Do you have any idea

07:01.668 --> 07:03.669
what triggered
such a violent fit?

07:06.232 --> 07:08.234
I found a letter on her bed.

07:09.955 --> 07:11.376
A break-up letter.

07:11.477 --> 07:13.839
You never told us
about any letter.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.222
What should I have done?

07:17.322 --> 07:19.424
[knocking urgently]
Nola! Nola?

07:19.524 --> 07:21.105
[locked door rattles]

07:21.205 --> 07:23.207
[breaks lock open]

07:30.054 --> 07:34.057
[♪♪♪♪♪]

07:39.422 --> 07:41.364
She was carrying on
an illicit romance

07:41.464 --> 07:43.666
with I didn't know who.

07:45.428 --> 07:47.089
But the writing...

07:47.189 --> 07:49.591
it wasn't any teenage boy.

07:52.754 --> 07:53.715
I couldn't let
the whole town think

07:53.795 --> 07:56.117
my little girl
was some kind of slut!

08:26.625 --> 08:31.370
I found these
after she disappeared...

08:31.470 --> 08:33.472
under a loose floorboard.

08:39.717 --> 08:41.379
They're not stamped.

08:41.479 --> 08:43.481
He must've hand-delivered them.

08:44.201 --> 08:47.985
They're all from
Harry Quebert.

08:48.085 --> 08:50.507
They're all the letters
in his book,

08:50.607 --> 08:53.250
"The Origin of Evil."

08:58.334 --> 09:00.436
This was the last one.

09:00.536 --> 09:05.021
The one she received the day
that broke her heart.

09:06.142 --> 09:08.143
May I?

09:17.312 --> 09:19.354
[paper rustling]

09:21.115 --> 09:22.016
[Marcus reads]:
"My darling...

09:22.116 --> 09:23.738
this is my final letter,

09:23.838 --> 09:26.300
a painful last embrace
before parting.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.622
Lovers separate

09:28.722 --> 09:30.704
and never
find each other again,

09:30.804 --> 09:33.587
and that is
how love stories end.

09:33.687 --> 09:37.230
But we who have loved
not with our eyes

09:37.330 --> 09:39.232
but with our souls

09:39.332 --> 09:42.034
can never truly be separated.

09:42.135 --> 09:43.396
I loved you against all hope,

09:43.496 --> 09:45.478
against all reason,
against all promise.

09:45.578 --> 09:47.319
You will be with me always,

09:47.419 --> 09:48.681
the last dream of my soul.

09:48.781 --> 09:50.782
H."

09:52.264 --> 09:55.627
It's the end
of "The Origin of Evil."

09:56.708 --> 09:58.770
It's the final page.

09:58.870 --> 10:00.051
How long have you known

10:00.151 --> 10:01.372
that Nola and Harry
were corresponding?

10:01.472 --> 10:04.075
Only the past few weeks.

10:07.358 --> 10:09.540
I just recently
bought a copy of the book.

10:09.640 --> 10:13.503
I needed to read it...

10:13.603 --> 10:17.007
to try and understand.

10:19.649 --> 10:20.990
When those letters appeared,

10:21.090 --> 10:23.112
I...

10:23.212 --> 10:25.074
I knew I'd seen them before,

10:25.174 --> 10:27.176
and that's when
I made the discovery.

10:29.258 --> 10:30.599
For the past 33 years,

10:30.699 --> 10:35.163
I've wondered who wrote
those letters to my daughter...

10:35.263 --> 10:37.325
and all that time,

10:37.425 --> 10:42.029
the answer was just sitting
in every bookstore in America.

10:44.231 --> 10:46.313
[scoffs]

10:48.195 --> 10:49.256
I can't believe it.

10:49.356 --> 10:50.497
He wasn't waiting
for her at the motel,

10:50.597 --> 10:51.498
like he said.

10:51.598 --> 10:52.779
He'd written her
a breakup letter.

10:52.879 --> 10:53.740
Son of a bitch.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.082
He never intended
to elope with her.

10:57.604 --> 10:59.185
So where'd he go, then?

10:59.285 --> 11:01.287
Why would he lie?

11:03.329 --> 11:05.471
Harry's cellphone is cut off.

11:05.571 --> 11:07.473
No activity
on his credit card.

11:07.573 --> 11:09.234
Okay.

11:09.334 --> 11:10.315
Okay, let me just...

11:10.415 --> 11:11.797
Just walk through this with me.

11:11.897 --> 11:14.439
So, he leaves a letter for her
in her mailbox, right?

11:14.539 --> 11:16.801
The day before their...
their supposed elopement,

11:16.901 --> 11:19.163
right before he skips town.
Right?

11:19.264 --> 11:20.244
Mm-hm.

11:20.345 --> 11:21.806
She finds it
in the morning,

11:21.906 --> 11:24.368
and she reads it,
and she breaks down.

11:24.468 --> 11:25.449
Right?
She has a fit.

11:25.549 --> 11:26.770
She starts
punishing herself.

11:26.871 --> 11:29.133
Okay, Dad...

11:29.233 --> 11:32.255
Dad locks himself
in the garage...

11:32.356 --> 11:34.377
And then what?
Where is...

11:34.477 --> 11:36.579
Where is she going
when she climbs out the window?

11:36.680 --> 11:38.341
To confront Harry.

11:38.441 --> 11:40.143
But on the way,
she runs into Luther,

11:40.243 --> 11:41.544
and everything goes wrong.

11:41.644 --> 11:44.226
Okay, but then why does Harry
come back to Sommerdale

11:44.327 --> 11:46.188
the day after she disappears?

11:46.288 --> 11:47.830
When he hears about it
on the news, he panics.

11:47.930 --> 11:48.751
Mm-hm.

11:48.851 --> 11:49.772
That letter would be
incriminating.

11:49.852 --> 11:51.313
Plus he has
real feelings for her,

11:51.413 --> 11:52.294
which makes it
all the more complicated.

11:52.374 --> 11:54.196
Yeah. We, uh...

11:54.296 --> 11:55.757
we gotta go find him.

11:55.857 --> 11:58.159
I don't think
that's possible.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.241
Border patrol records
have him crossing into Canada

12:00.341 --> 12:01.522
at Derby Line, Vermont.

12:01.622 --> 12:02.763
Huh...

12:02.864 --> 12:03.884
In the unpublished
manuscript

12:03.985 --> 12:05.406
that we found
in his locker,

12:05.506 --> 12:07.207
"The Seagulls of Sommerdale,"

12:07.308 --> 12:09.490
he ends up in Canada with Nola,
remember?

12:09.590 --> 12:11.371
I mean, I still
don't get it.

12:11.471 --> 12:13.173
The charges have
been dropped, so...

12:13.273 --> 12:15.675
what the hell
is he running from?

12:20.199 --> 12:23.142
[crowds cheering]

12:23.242 --> 12:24.663
[reporter]:
The crowd behind us

12:24.764 --> 12:27.706
is basically
shoulder to shoulder,

12:27.806 --> 12:29.908
with people standing
all the way up,

12:30.008 --> 12:32.270
all the way through
to the Capitol,

12:32.371 --> 12:34.272
and now we're seeing
the President...

12:34.372 --> 12:38.436
[crowd cheering]

12:38.536 --> 12:39.717
[inaugural emcee]:
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:39.817 --> 12:41.279
the president
of the United States,

12:41.379 --> 12:44.121
Barack H. Obama.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.423
[crowd cheering]

12:48.625 --> 12:49.486
Hi!

12:49.586 --> 12:51.728
Sorry I'm late.

12:51.828 --> 12:53.530
Oh, my God...

12:53.630 --> 12:55.732
It's like those
pictures of VJ Day.

12:55.832 --> 12:57.614
Like in World War II?

12:57.714 --> 12:59.656
Everyone is so happy,

12:59.756 --> 13:01.537
and so full
of hope and pride.

13:01.637 --> 13:02.818
It's... it's like
they can't believe

13:02.919 --> 13:03.899
they actually did it!

13:04.000 --> 13:05.341
[laughs]

13:05.441 --> 13:07.263
Oh, I got you a mug.

13:07.363 --> 13:08.344
Thanks.

13:08.444 --> 13:09.545
Can you put
some coffee in it?

13:09.645 --> 13:11.627
Absolutely.

13:11.727 --> 13:13.728
[sighs happily]

13:15.650 --> 13:17.232
You know,
it's days like these

13:17.332 --> 13:19.474
that you regain
faith in humanity.

13:19.574 --> 13:20.915
It's like we're evolving.

13:21.015 --> 13:22.476
We're getting better
as a species.

13:22.577 --> 13:24.238
Yeah? Well,
let's, uh...

13:24.338 --> 13:25.239
let's see if he
turns out to be

13:25.339 --> 13:27.361
who he says he is.

13:27.461 --> 13:29.283
That's weird,

13:29.383 --> 13:31.325
coming from
his number-one fan.

13:31.425 --> 13:32.366
Well, no, I mean,

13:32.466 --> 13:35.889
you never really
know a person, do you?

13:35.989 --> 13:37.330
You look up to someone,

13:37.430 --> 13:39.652
admire his... integrity,

13:39.752 --> 13:40.773
his intelligence,

13:40.873 --> 13:42.375
and then one day,

13:42.475 --> 13:45.538
you discover he's betrayed you,

13:45.638 --> 13:47.259
and that it was all a lie.

13:47.359 --> 13:51.623
You have any idea
how shitty that feels?

13:51.723 --> 13:53.765
I walked in on my husband
in bed with my best friend.

13:55.527 --> 13:56.468
We had gone
to the Hamptons

13:56.568 --> 13:57.549
for the weekend

13:57.649 --> 14:00.191
with my best friend
and her husband,

14:00.291 --> 14:01.953
and on that Saturday afternoon,

14:02.053 --> 14:03.874
my husband said he wasn't
feeling that well,

14:03.974 --> 14:08.639
so I...
went into town by myself.

14:08.739 --> 14:11.882
But it started to rain,
so I came back,

14:11.982 --> 14:15.485
and I found my husband
on top of my best friend.

14:15.585 --> 14:17.487
Oh, my God.

14:17.587 --> 14:19.589
What did you do?

14:20.109 --> 14:22.411
Nothing.

14:22.511 --> 14:24.974
They didn't see me, so I...

14:25.074 --> 14:29.378
turned around and left,
and I went for another walk.

14:29.478 --> 14:31.820
When I came back,

14:31.920 --> 14:33.341
I found him in the hotel bar,

14:33.441 --> 14:35.023
drinking with
my best friend's husband,

14:35.123 --> 14:36.865
and...

14:36.965 --> 14:38.546
that night,
we all had dinner together.

14:38.646 --> 14:40.908
Well, did you...

14:41.008 --> 14:42.670
did you divorce him?

14:42.770 --> 14:43.551
No.

14:43.651 --> 14:45.513
He left me.

14:45.613 --> 14:47.614
For her.

14:51.938 --> 14:53.440
Is there anything else
I can get you?

14:53.540 --> 14:55.542
Uh, no. Thanks, Denise.

14:56.102 --> 14:58.544
Okay.

15:06.952 --> 15:09.414
[♪♪♪♪♪]

15:09.515 --> 15:11.897
[Roy]: This is a one-woman
horror show here.

15:11.997 --> 15:13.378
[sighs]

15:13.478 --> 15:14.459
Daughter kills Mommy,

15:14.559 --> 15:16.541
then she becomes her,

15:16.641 --> 15:19.344
then she starts
beating herself silly?

15:19.444 --> 15:20.585
I mean, this
out-psychos "Psycho."

15:20.685 --> 15:22.627
Yeah, but the whole
infantile psychosis thing

15:22.727 --> 15:24.829
is, uh... it's funky.

15:24.929 --> 15:27.511
You know, I just... [sighs]

15:27.611 --> 15:29.513
I think there's still
too many missing pieces.

15:29.613 --> 15:31.715
Okay? Just with Harry
disappearing, and these...

15:31.815 --> 15:34.277
these cryptic messages,
this unpublished manuscript--

15:34.377 --> 15:35.959
Which would make a fabulous
prequel, by the way.

15:36.059 --> 15:37.400
Yeah, you're missing
the point, Roy--

15:37.500 --> 15:38.361
No, no, no, no, no.

15:38.461 --> 15:39.522
No, no, you're
missing the point.

15:39.622 --> 15:41.644
This childhood madness,
this is a godsend.

15:41.744 --> 15:43.926
We'll put out
a press release

15:44.026 --> 15:46.368
saying we knew about this
from the beginning,

15:46.468 --> 15:48.490
but that you decided
to tell the truth

15:48.590 --> 15:51.613
to demonstrate that reality

15:51.713 --> 15:53.935
is never what it seems.

15:54.035 --> 15:56.017
Now we're
talking Pulitzer.

15:56.117 --> 15:57.338
Look, just give me a week.

15:57.438 --> 15:59.380
Give me one week
to dig a little deeper

15:59.480 --> 16:00.982
before you put out
a press release, okay?

16:01.082 --> 16:02.063
Fine.

16:02.163 --> 16:03.384
Thank you.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.486
One week.

16:06.407 --> 16:09.610
[police radio chatter]

16:16.496 --> 16:17.877
[tires screech]

16:17.977 --> 16:19.038
[car engine starts]

16:19.138 --> 16:21.140
[officer]:
We'll call you back.

16:26.185 --> 16:28.187
[siren wails]

16:51.728 --> 16:53.150
Did you know you ran
a red light back there?

16:53.250 --> 16:54.110
Uh...

16:54.210 --> 16:54.991
And you were speeding?

16:55.091 --> 16:57.714
Uh, well, sorry. I--

16:57.814 --> 16:58.875
License
and registration.

16:58.975 --> 17:00.476
Yeah, just a second.

17:00.576 --> 17:02.578
Uh...

17:04.019 --> 17:06.021
What happened
to your face?

17:10.025 --> 17:11.646
Have you been drinking, sir?

17:11.747 --> 17:12.767
[mumbling] Huh?

17:12.868 --> 17:14.869
What?

17:37.010 --> 17:39.432
Sergeant Gahalowood?

17:39.532 --> 17:41.594
This is Officer Forsyth
from, uh...

17:41.694 --> 17:42.995
Montburry County.

17:43.095 --> 17:46.598
Sorry to disturb you
at this hour, but, um...

17:46.699 --> 17:49.481
we have somebody
in custody here

17:49.581 --> 17:53.225
that I think
you'll be interested in.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.989
[cell phone rings]

17:59.590 --> 18:01.592
[cell phone rings]

18:02.313 --> 18:04.315
[cell phone rings]

18:07.838 --> 18:08.979
[mumbles groggily] Hello?

18:09.079 --> 18:11.101
[Perry]: Met our firebug.

18:11.201 --> 18:13.183
I'm sorry, what?

18:13.283 --> 18:14.744
The arsonist
who set fire to Harry's house

18:14.844 --> 18:16.846
was arrested tonight.

18:17.687 --> 18:18.728
Montburry police
matched the prints

18:18.808 --> 18:20.470
from a traffic stop.

18:20.570 --> 18:21.430
Who is it?

18:21.530 --> 18:23.592
Are you sitting down?

18:23.692 --> 18:24.553
I'm, uh...

18:24.653 --> 18:27.036
I'm lying down, actually.

18:27.136 --> 18:28.597
Good.

18:28.697 --> 18:31.500
Less of a fall
when you hear who it is.

18:44.672 --> 18:46.674
Thank you.

18:48.555 --> 18:49.576
You look like shit.

18:49.676 --> 18:51.678
Yeah, thanks.

18:55.642 --> 18:56.663
Are you sure
you got the right guy?

18:56.763 --> 18:57.784
'cause I can't see it--

18:57.884 --> 19:00.066
Fingerprints matched
the ones on the gas can.

19:00.166 --> 19:01.787
So that means he sent
all those messages too.

19:01.887 --> 19:03.889
Seems like it.

19:11.857 --> 19:13.598
Oh, man...

19:13.698 --> 19:15.240
But what's...
what's his motive?

19:15.340 --> 19:17.602
I wish I knew.

19:17.702 --> 19:19.003
He's refusing to talk.

19:19.103 --> 19:20.645
And the trouble is,

19:20.745 --> 19:21.886
Quinn's lawyer's claiming

19:21.986 --> 19:23.647
that he found the gas can
on the beach that night.

19:23.748 --> 19:24.608
Oh yeah?

19:24.708 --> 19:25.889
Yeah.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.010
He was out
for a walk.

19:27.111 --> 19:27.971
Picked it up,

19:28.071 --> 19:29.052
threw it
in the bushes.

19:29.152 --> 19:30.974
[door bangs open]
I have spent the morning

19:31.074 --> 19:32.656
on the phone
with the governor

19:32.756 --> 19:34.577
and a slew
of goddamn reporters.

19:34.678 --> 19:35.779
They all want my head.

19:35.879 --> 19:37.220
I'm Marcus Goldman.
I wrote the--

19:37.320 --> 19:39.782
Yeah, I know
what you wrote.

19:39.882 --> 19:42.625
It can't go on
like this, Perry.

19:42.725 --> 19:44.226
The DA and the governor
want this case closed.

19:44.326 --> 19:45.668
We just arrested
Robert Quinn

19:45.768 --> 19:46.989
last night.
I need some time--

19:47.089 --> 19:48.030
First it was Quebert.

19:48.130 --> 19:49.271
Then it was Caleb,

19:49.371 --> 19:51.033
then the father,

19:51.133 --> 19:53.515
and now
it's this Quinn guy?

19:53.615 --> 19:56.598
You change perps more often
than your underwear.

19:56.698 --> 19:59.160
If you could just
give me a few--

19:59.260 --> 20:01.262
24 hours. That's it!

20:01.943 --> 20:04.245
Tomorrow. 5:00.

20:04.345 --> 20:07.287
You come to my office
and you tell me officially

20:07.387 --> 20:09.389
the Kellergan case
is closed.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.713
[slams door]

20:17.837 --> 20:18.738
Great, we're
on our way.

20:18.838 --> 20:20.059
Yeah, we'll
see you there.

20:20.159 --> 20:21.741
Hey, Roy, now
is not a good time.

20:21.841 --> 20:23.222
Well, I'll just assume
you'll meet me tomorrow

20:23.322 --> 20:25.624
at 5:00, my office,
for your big press launch.

20:25.724 --> 20:26.665
Listen, I can't, okay?

20:26.765 --> 20:28.267
We just got a new lead.
It's, uh, it's...

20:28.367 --> 20:30.108
you're gonna have to
hold 'em off a bit longer.

20:30.208 --> 20:31.710
Disappoint the cognoscenti?

20:31.810 --> 20:33.912
They'll tear you to pieces
like a pack of wild dogs.

20:34.012 --> 20:35.954
Not exactly the liftoff
your book deserves.

20:36.054 --> 20:37.035
Tomorrow afternoon.

20:37.135 --> 20:39.137
Don't be late.

20:42.380 --> 20:44.081
I'm speaking to the press
tomorrow at 5:00.

20:44.181 --> 20:45.242
All right.

20:45.342 --> 20:46.643
So at 5:00 tomorrow,

20:46.744 --> 20:48.745
we'll both have
officially fucked up.

20:55.952 --> 20:57.573
I still can't
believe it.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.055
Maybe he really did

20:59.155 --> 21:01.657
just find the gas can
while he was walking.

21:01.757 --> 21:02.898
Does your
father-in-law

21:02.998 --> 21:04.820
usually take late-night
walks by Goose Cove

21:04.920 --> 21:07.022
without
telling anyone?

21:07.122 --> 21:09.064
How are Jenny
and Mrs. Quinn?

21:09.164 --> 21:10.665
They're in shock.

21:10.766 --> 21:11.787
Tamara said
she didn't even know

21:11.887 --> 21:13.188
he'd gone
out last
night.

21:13.288 --> 21:14.629
She was dead asleep.

21:14.729 --> 21:15.830
Do you think that--

21:15.930 --> 21:17.712
No, I don't
think anything,

21:17.812 --> 21:20.234
but I, uh...

21:20.334 --> 21:22.336
I found this...

21:28.822 --> 21:31.685
It was in a...
a box of family photos

21:31.785 --> 21:33.787
that Jenny keeps at our house.

21:34.788 --> 21:36.789
Check the back.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.375
So he owned
a black Monte Carlo?

21:43.476 --> 21:44.937
Well, why didn't Pratt--

21:45.037 --> 21:46.098
No, Jenny said

21:46.198 --> 21:48.140
her father wanted to buy
a new car that summer,

21:48.240 --> 21:52.244
and would often take different
models for test drives.

21:56.487 --> 21:57.789
[Tamara]: Bobbo would never...

21:57.889 --> 22:03.114
but he was...

22:03.214 --> 22:06.357
acting a little strange...

22:06.457 --> 22:08.799
last night.

22:08.899 --> 22:11.761
He, uh...

22:11.862 --> 22:14.784
kept asking me
to drink this cup of tea.

22:15.865 --> 22:17.166
Just drink it,
honey bunny.

22:17.267 --> 22:18.768
Look, I don't want
any tea.

22:18.868 --> 22:19.809
Drink it for Bobbo.

22:19.909 --> 22:21.250
I'm not British,
for God's sakes.

22:21.350 --> 22:23.772
It's a diuretic.
It'll do you good.

22:23.873 --> 22:27.096
And I was...
feeling a little bloated,

22:27.196 --> 22:28.657
so I drank it.

22:28.757 --> 22:30.739
[sniffles]

22:30.839 --> 22:32.741
And then...

22:32.841 --> 22:35.783
I fell asleep
like a dead person.

22:35.884 --> 22:37.885
What time was that?

22:40.528 --> 22:42.149
I...

22:42.249 --> 22:44.151
guess it was...

22:44.251 --> 22:45.873
around 11:00.

22:45.973 --> 22:47.234
Yeah, 'cause...

22:47.334 --> 22:50.957
Law & Order was playing.

22:51.057 --> 22:53.119
And then...

22:53.219 --> 22:57.764
the next thing I know,
it was morning,

22:57.864 --> 23:00.206
and then...

23:00.306 --> 23:03.189
the police were knocking
at the door.

23:05.791 --> 23:06.932
Mrs. Quinn, is it true

23:07.032 --> 23:08.934
that your husband
was thinking about buying

23:09.034 --> 23:11.997
a Chevrolet Monte Carlo
during the summer of '75?

23:13.918 --> 23:15.700
Uh, yeah.

23:15.800 --> 23:17.862
I think so.

23:17.962 --> 23:18.783
Until I told him

23:18.883 --> 23:20.384
that I...

23:20.484 --> 23:23.908
I thought it made him
look like a pimp.

23:24.008 --> 23:26.390
[sobbing]
But I just can't...

23:26.490 --> 23:28.191
believe that
he would ever do that.

23:28.292 --> 23:30.714
He could never do anything

23:30.814 --> 23:32.796
to harm that girl.

23:32.896 --> 23:33.997
Do you understand?

23:34.097 --> 23:36.879
He's a kind man.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.041
[sobs]

23:38.141 --> 23:40.142
Honey, I'm gonna be sick.

23:46.829 --> 23:48.370
[Tamara retching]

23:48.470 --> 23:50.052
I'm sorry, this has...

23:50.152 --> 23:53.735
all been a little hard
for us to digest.

23:53.835 --> 23:55.837
[sighs]

24:02.363 --> 24:05.265
Yeah, this is the spot.

24:05.366 --> 24:06.467
It's right here.

24:06.567 --> 24:10.030
Guy drove out
like a bat outta hell.

24:10.130 --> 24:12.132
That's the road that leads
to Montburry Lake.

24:19.378 --> 24:21.841
What are we looking
for, Sergeant?

24:21.941 --> 24:23.842
A weapon,
personal effects,

24:23.943 --> 24:24.883
anything that can tie
our suspect

24:24.984 --> 24:26.485
to the Kellergan case.

24:26.585 --> 24:28.767
You realize this lake is
a dumping ground, right?

24:28.867 --> 24:30.088
So if you could be
a little more precise?

24:30.188 --> 24:31.489
Near the shore.

24:31.590 --> 24:34.212
Focus on the marsh
over here.

24:34.312 --> 24:35.934
The suspect
was covered in mud.

24:36.034 --> 24:38.176
He had a scratch on his face,

24:38.276 --> 24:42.900
probably caused by a low branch.

24:43.000 --> 24:43.981
I'm guessing
he was trying to hide

24:44.081 --> 24:45.022
whatever it was

24:45.122 --> 24:46.543
where no one
would look for it.

24:46.643 --> 24:48.765
All right.

24:51.688 --> 24:54.911
[cell phone rings]

24:55.011 --> 24:56.152
Hello?

24:56.252 --> 24:57.353
You find anything?

24:57.453 --> 24:59.555
Uh, no, sir,
not yet.

24:59.655 --> 25:01.917
We've got a press
conference at 5:00.

25:02.017 --> 25:03.239
Show up with
some definitive proof,

25:03.339 --> 25:05.240
or you can take
your sorry ass to Canada

25:05.341 --> 25:07.002
and join the goddamn
Mounties.

25:07.102 --> 25:09.104
[call disconnects]

25:10.305 --> 25:12.307
He says hi.

25:13.988 --> 25:15.990
[♪♪♪♪♪]

25:44.256 --> 25:46.258
Over here!

25:49.101 --> 25:50.001
Sergeant!

25:50.102 --> 25:52.123
Over here!

25:52.223 --> 25:54.225
Sergeant!

25:57.268 --> 25:58.489
[♪♪♪♪♪]

25:58.589 --> 26:00.591
They got something.

26:06.597 --> 26:08.138
We found a handgun

26:08.238 --> 26:10.941
and a necklace
with Nola's name on it

26:11.041 --> 26:13.623
in Montburry Lake.

26:13.723 --> 26:18.167
Any idea how they
got there, Mr. Quinn?

26:24.133 --> 26:27.196
The, uh, black Monte Carlo
at the scene of the crime,

26:27.296 --> 26:30.639
that was yours
all along, wasn't it?

26:30.739 --> 26:31.960
A loaner car,

26:32.060 --> 26:34.162
uh, you were conveniently
test-driving

26:34.262 --> 26:38.005
during the time
of Nola's disappearance.

26:38.106 --> 26:39.927
It couldn't be traced
to you 'cause...

26:40.027 --> 26:42.570
you didn't own it.

26:42.670 --> 26:44.672
It's clever.

26:45.753 --> 26:49.636
Except you got yourself
photographed next to it.

26:53.119 --> 26:55.121
Mm-hm.

26:55.481 --> 26:57.483
Yeah.

27:02.648 --> 27:05.551
Game over,
Mr. Quinn.

27:05.651 --> 27:08.433
Why'd you kill
Nola Kellergan

27:08.533 --> 27:10.856
and Deborah Cooper?

27:14.699 --> 27:18.142
I don't know.

27:21.465 --> 27:23.467
It was an accident.

27:26.550 --> 27:29.052
I saw her, Nola...

27:29.152 --> 27:30.654
[sniffles]

27:30.754 --> 27:33.416
walking
by the side of the road,

27:33.516 --> 27:37.260
so I, uh,
I offered her a ride.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.942
She thanked me for stopping,
and got in.

27:40.042 --> 27:42.665
And we drove...

27:42.765 --> 27:44.767
for a few minutes, and then...

27:47.529 --> 27:50.232
I just felt so lonely.

27:50.332 --> 27:52.153
[sobbing]

27:52.253 --> 27:55.276
And she was so beautiful.

27:55.376 --> 27:58.299
So friendly.

28:00.141 --> 28:02.963
I wanted to touch her.

28:03.063 --> 28:08.448
Just to stroke her hair.

28:08.548 --> 28:12.692
But she...she panicked
and started to scream.

28:12.792 --> 28:16.095
I-I stopped the car
to calm her down,

28:16.195 --> 28:18.297
and she got out,

28:18.397 --> 28:21.280
started running into the woods.

28:23.522 --> 28:27.746
I had to catch her
so she wouldn't tell anyone.

28:27.846 --> 28:32.190
Then she went
to Deborah Cooper's place.

28:32.290 --> 28:35.153
I didn't want to hurt 'em,

28:35.253 --> 28:38.276
but...

28:38.376 --> 28:41.419
they would've talked.

28:48.545 --> 28:50.987
[cell phone rings]

28:53.670 --> 28:55.491
Chief Dawn.

28:55.591 --> 28:58.574
Travis, your father-in-law
just signed a full confession.

28:58.674 --> 28:59.935
Okay.

29:00.036 --> 29:01.817
There'll be a press
conference at 5:00.

29:01.917 --> 29:03.779
News will spread quickly.

29:03.879 --> 29:06.501
I, uh, I didn't want you
or your wife or Mrs. Quinn

29:06.602 --> 29:08.183
to have to find out
secondhand.

29:08.283 --> 29:10.305
Thank you, Sergeant.

29:10.405 --> 29:12.027
If you could make it
up to Augusta,

29:12.127 --> 29:15.189
clear up a couple of things
about Mr. Quinn,

29:15.290 --> 29:16.391
I prefer not to inflict
any more pain

29:16.491 --> 29:18.272
on his wife or daughter.

29:18.372 --> 29:20.154
Of course.

29:20.254 --> 29:22.036
Look, I'm on duty
at the moment.

29:22.136 --> 29:25.239
There's been a car accident,
and they're waiting for me,

29:25.339 --> 29:29.402
and I should
talk to Jenny first.

29:29.503 --> 29:32.045
Can I come by tomorrow?

29:32.145 --> 29:34.047
Yeah. Yeah, tomorrow works.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.129
Yeah, no rush, man.

29:36.229 --> 29:38.351
Thanks again, Sergeant.

29:42.314 --> 29:45.217
I wouldn't wanna be there
for that conversation,

29:45.317 --> 29:47.319
telling Jenny.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.442
I think this calls for
a little celebrating, huh?

29:51.603 --> 29:52.344
Really?

29:52.444 --> 29:53.264
Yeah.

29:53.364 --> 29:55.366
This one's on me.

29:58.649 --> 29:59.610
You sure you don't
want anything else?

29:59.690 --> 30:01.152
I'm good, I'm good.

30:01.252 --> 30:03.073
Come on, man, get a donut.

30:03.173 --> 30:05.195
I got you.

30:05.295 --> 30:07.297
I'm good.

30:09.940 --> 30:11.361
Oh, God.

30:11.461 --> 30:14.524
Well, I'm not making it
back to Manhattan by 5:00.

30:14.624 --> 30:15.645
You're not gonna be
in any trouble?

30:15.745 --> 30:16.606
No.

30:16.706 --> 30:18.247
No, as soon as
my publisher finds out

30:18.347 --> 30:19.528
I'm helping
the Maine State Police,

30:19.629 --> 30:21.250
he'll find a way to spin it
into more book sales.

30:21.350 --> 30:22.131
Right.

30:22.231 --> 30:23.132
[cell phone rings]

30:23.232 --> 30:24.293
Oh, this is probably

30:24.393 --> 30:27.215
about my 5:00
press conference.

30:27.316 --> 30:29.538
Hello?

30:29.638 --> 30:33.741
Uh, can it wait?

30:33.842 --> 30:35.663
Okay.

30:35.763 --> 30:38.386
Okay, we'll be there
in, uh, 20 minutes.

30:38.486 --> 30:40.267
All right.

30:40.368 --> 30:41.589
That didn't sound like
Chief Lansdane.

30:41.689 --> 30:44.111
Yeah, that was Elijah Stern's
partner, Bo Sylford.

30:44.211 --> 30:45.272
He wants us to come over.

30:45.372 --> 30:46.513
Bo Sylford?

30:46.613 --> 30:48.615
What the hell is that about?

31:05.350 --> 31:06.151
We've been
fighting constantly

31:06.231 --> 31:08.233
since we last
saw you, Sergeant.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.536
There's things that,
uh, he hasn't told you

31:11.636 --> 31:12.937
that need to be said.

31:13.037 --> 31:15.039
Please.

31:18.803 --> 31:20.264
[Elijah Stern]: I'm afraid
I haven't been

31:20.364 --> 31:24.528
completely forthright
with you, Sergeant.

31:25.929 --> 31:30.393
Directly or indirectly,

31:30.493 --> 31:35.918
I am responsible
for Nola Kellergan's death.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.480
Mr. Stern, if you're
trying to protect

31:37.580 --> 31:38.481
Luther Caleb,

31:38.581 --> 31:39.762
there's no need.

31:39.862 --> 31:42.324
We have a confession
from someone else.

31:42.424 --> 31:43.966
Luther's name's
already been cleared.

31:44.066 --> 31:47.409
But mine's not.

31:47.509 --> 31:50.572
You know that Luther
was obsessed

31:50.672 --> 31:51.613
with Miss Kellergan?

31:51.713 --> 31:52.814
We do.

31:52.914 --> 31:54.295
But you don't know
the extent

31:54.395 --> 31:55.897
of that obsession.

31:55.997 --> 31:58.539
He would sneak off
to Sommerdale

31:58.639 --> 32:00.261
to watch her
with Harry.

32:00.361 --> 32:01.622
Day after day,

32:01.722 --> 32:03.424
he'd report to me
what they'd done,

32:03.524 --> 32:05.185
what they'd said,
where they'd gone.

32:05.285 --> 32:07.307
He...

32:07.407 --> 32:09.829
experienced love

32:09.930 --> 32:12.792
vicariously through them.

32:12.892 --> 32:16.796
It became such a preoccupation
that I rarely saw him.

32:16.896 --> 32:18.918
I had to drive myself
to my meetings.

32:19.018 --> 32:21.921
Why didn't you fire him?

32:22.021 --> 32:24.022
Because you were
in love with him?

32:25.944 --> 32:29.588
Because I was in his debt.

32:30.869 --> 32:32.730
[door opens]

32:32.831 --> 32:34.993
[door closes]

32:39.797 --> 32:41.859
Luther.

32:41.959 --> 32:43.901
Luther?

32:44.001 --> 32:47.304
[Elijah]: The situation had
deteriorated so badly that...

32:47.404 --> 32:50.267
Luther was beaten up
by a policeman

32:50.367 --> 32:52.308
for vagrancy.

32:52.408 --> 32:53.630
A waitress had apparently

32:53.730 --> 32:56.472
filed a complaint
against him...

32:56.572 --> 32:59.795
You will not go back
to Sommerdale again.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.797
I forbid it.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.839
But I must...

33:03.939 --> 33:05.941
I must go.

33:06.742 --> 33:10.405
I want you to go home,
back to Massachusetts.

33:10.505 --> 33:11.886
Just for a while.

33:11.986 --> 33:13.047
You don't
understand--

33:13.148 --> 33:14.188
Just to get that girl
out of your system.

33:14.269 --> 33:15.850
You don't understand.
You don't understand!

33:15.950 --> 33:17.331
You don't understand!

33:17.431 --> 33:18.532
You...

33:18.633 --> 33:20.634
[gasping]

33:24.118 --> 33:27.981
They're running away.

33:28.081 --> 33:29.943
In ten days, on the 30th,

33:30.043 --> 33:31.424
they will be gone,

33:31.524 --> 33:33.526
and they will never come back.

33:36.008 --> 33:40.433
[Elijah]: And then,
on August 29th...

33:40.533 --> 33:43.355
Luther disappeared.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.397
His blue Mustang
was in its usual place,

33:45.497 --> 33:46.999
but I soon discovered

33:47.099 --> 33:49.481
that one of my cars was gone.

33:49.581 --> 33:51.763
A black Monte Carlo.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.365
He'd been asking
to borrow it

33:54.465 --> 33:57.448
because his blue Mustang
had become too recognizable.

33:57.548 --> 34:01.412
I'd said no, of course.

34:01.512 --> 34:03.894
I was furious.

34:03.994 --> 34:05.996
And worried...

34:08.839 --> 34:12.402
If he was capable
of that kind of subterfuge...

34:13.963 --> 34:16.365
what else was he hiding?

34:40.588 --> 34:42.850
And that's when I found them...

34:42.950 --> 34:47.014
the letters that he'd stolen.

34:47.114 --> 34:50.116
The letters between
Harry and Nola.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.782
What the hell have you done?

34:56.883 --> 34:58.884
Don't touch those,
they're private.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.767
[blow lands]

35:02.688 --> 35:04.990
What the hell have you done?

35:05.090 --> 35:07.552
Leave that poor girl alone!

35:07.652 --> 35:09.654
You fuckin' redneck!
[kicking]

35:14.619 --> 35:16.621
You fuckin' redneck!
[kicking]

35:20.184 --> 35:22.186
Elijah...

35:25.629 --> 35:29.132
That night,
it was you.

35:29.232 --> 35:31.634
It was you.

35:40.082 --> 35:42.084
[door closes]

35:42.564 --> 35:44.546
[Elijah]: And so he left.
[car starts outside]

35:44.646 --> 35:47.549
He took the Monte Carlo,
and he left.

35:47.649 --> 35:48.550
[car drives away]

35:48.650 --> 35:50.772
I never saw him again.

35:53.534 --> 35:57.098
He'd recognized
my voice, you see.

35:58.979 --> 36:01.161
When I was younger...

36:01.262 --> 36:02.803
I would...

36:02.903 --> 36:07.047
meet up with some of
my college friends,

36:07.147 --> 36:11.531
a kind of fraternity,
I guess you'd call it,

36:11.631 --> 36:12.892
and we'd go away for weekends,

36:12.992 --> 36:14.854
stay in expensive hotels,

36:14.954 --> 36:16.255
drink,

36:16.355 --> 36:20.499
act like the arrogant,
entitled monsters that we were.

36:20.599 --> 36:22.581
We were desperate
to prove to ourselves

36:22.681 --> 36:25.504
that we were powerful.

36:25.604 --> 36:27.866
[car door slams, laughter]
Hey! Let's get this one!

36:27.966 --> 36:29.668
Whoo! Yeah!

36:29.768 --> 36:31.429
[laughing]
Hey, redneck!

36:31.529 --> 36:33.471
Where you going?

36:33.571 --> 36:34.792
[boys laughing]

36:34.892 --> 36:36.594
And he is down
on the 20-yard line!

36:36.694 --> 36:37.475
[blow thuds] Oh!

36:37.575 --> 36:38.756
[cruel laughter]

36:38.856 --> 36:40.758
Come on, hit him!
Boom!

36:40.858 --> 36:42.720
All right, should we go
for the field goal?

36:42.820 --> 36:44.761
You're up.

36:44.862 --> 36:46.563
Show us what you got.
Let's go.

36:46.663 --> 36:48.605
You fucking redneck!

36:48.705 --> 36:49.566
[laughing] Oh!

36:49.666 --> 36:51.167
Come on,
let's go!

36:51.267 --> 36:52.088
All right,
he had enough.

36:52.188 --> 36:52.929
[laughing]

36:53.029 --> 36:55.031
Whoo!

36:55.711 --> 36:59.815
It was in all the papers.

36:59.915 --> 37:04.019
The police never found
the culprits.

37:04.119 --> 37:06.942
But I knew,

37:07.042 --> 37:09.744
and...

37:09.844 --> 37:12.867
was sickened by what I'd done.

37:12.967 --> 37:14.869
A few years later,

37:14.969 --> 37:17.792
I tracked him down, and...

37:17.892 --> 37:21.735
stuck a nail in my tire,
asked him if he could fix it.

37:23.897 --> 37:28.461
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but I seem to have a flat tire.

37:31.064 --> 37:32.685
I offered him a job,

37:32.785 --> 37:35.708
and he took it.

37:37.590 --> 37:40.072
But he wasn't happy.

37:42.755 --> 37:44.296
I gave him money,

37:44.396 --> 37:46.098
a car...

37:46.198 --> 37:48.320
I built him
an artist's studio...

37:51.322 --> 37:54.565
but nothing
could assuage my guilt.

37:56.727 --> 37:58.789
The servants
were afraid of him.

37:58.889 --> 38:00.711
He had no friends,

38:00.811 --> 38:03.634
no girlfriends.

38:03.734 --> 38:05.636
The only thing he could do
with a woman, he said,

38:05.736 --> 38:08.638
was to paint her.

38:08.738 --> 38:11.561
So...

38:11.661 --> 38:13.663
I bought him some.

38:14.624 --> 38:17.326
Blondes.

38:17.426 --> 38:18.287
Mostly...

38:18.387 --> 38:21.170
strawberry blondes...

38:21.270 --> 38:23.832
like his fiancée.

38:26.114 --> 38:31.019
Then he met Nola

38:31.119 --> 38:33.941
and fell in love with her,

38:34.042 --> 38:36.304
the first time
he'd ever fallen in love

38:36.404 --> 38:39.086
since... the accident.

38:41.729 --> 38:43.590
Then Harry turns up,

38:43.690 --> 38:45.192
brilliant,

38:45.292 --> 38:47.154
handsome,

38:47.254 --> 38:49.115
and of course,

38:49.215 --> 38:51.598
Nola fell in love with him.

38:51.698 --> 38:54.720
And so Luther decided
he would live through Harry.

38:54.821 --> 38:56.722
Love through Harry.

38:56.822 --> 38:58.124
When Nola disappeared,

38:58.224 --> 38:59.685
and it was announced

38:59.785 --> 39:03.809
that the suspect was driving
a black Monte Carlo,

39:03.909 --> 39:05.651
you can imagine
what I thought.

39:05.751 --> 39:07.812
Uh-huh,
but you kept quiet.

39:07.913 --> 39:08.773
Yes,

39:08.873 --> 39:12.577
so he'd never be suspected.

39:12.677 --> 39:14.979
I knew...

39:15.079 --> 39:18.622
whatever he'd done,

39:18.722 --> 39:22.126
I drove him to it.

39:28.091 --> 39:30.393
What does all this
have to do with Robert Quinn

39:30.493 --> 39:31.754
and Nola's murder?

39:31.855 --> 39:34.717
I guess just that
it's a huge coincidence,

39:34.817 --> 39:38.801
that, uh, Luther, Stern,
Harry, and Mr. Quinn

39:38.901 --> 39:42.044
all drove black Monte Carlos
in the summer of '75.

39:42.144 --> 39:44.146
Like, maybe it
was a popular car.

39:45.027 --> 39:46.408
A lot of coincidences.

39:46.508 --> 39:48.510
Yeah.

39:49.110 --> 39:50.852
Here's another one.

39:50.952 --> 39:53.174
Quinn said he saw
Nola Kellergan by chance

39:53.274 --> 39:54.375
while he was driving, right?

39:54.475 --> 39:55.816
Right.

39:55.917 --> 39:58.279
Why did he have
a gun with him?

40:02.803 --> 40:03.624
What year was Watergate?

40:03.724 --> 40:07.007
Uh... 1974. Why?

40:08.328 --> 40:11.271
[accelerating]

40:11.371 --> 40:13.373
[♪♪♪♪♪]

40:19.778 --> 40:22.761
Look at the newspaper box
behind him.

40:22.861 --> 40:24.863
I can't...
Give me the...

40:28.867 --> 40:30.769
See it?

40:30.869 --> 40:32.290
Nixon resigned
in August, 1974.

40:32.390 --> 40:33.451
There is no way

40:33.551 --> 40:35.733
that that photo was
taken in August, 1975.

40:35.833 --> 40:37.835
Holy shit!

40:50.407 --> 40:52.308
Who are you protecting?

40:52.408 --> 40:55.071
You test-drove
a black Monte Carlo in '74,

40:55.171 --> 40:56.912
not '75.

40:57.013 --> 40:58.834
You're protecting someone,
and I wanna know who.

40:58.934 --> 41:00.676
Huh?

41:00.776 --> 41:04.319
Your wife?
Daughter?

41:04.419 --> 41:05.801
Fine.

41:05.901 --> 41:07.682
We'll bring them both in
for questioning,

41:07.782 --> 41:09.804
and keep them here
until we get some answers.

41:09.904 --> 41:12.867
Are you sure you wanna
subject them to that?

41:20.834 --> 41:21.695
Who are you calling?

41:21.795 --> 41:23.096
Travis.

41:23.197 --> 41:25.238
I need his help
getting Quinn to talk.

41:29.522 --> 41:30.303
Damn it!

41:30.403 --> 41:32.405
He's not picking up.

41:35.928 --> 41:38.070
Hey, it's Sergeant Gahalowood,
Maine State Police.

41:38.170 --> 41:41.193
I need to talk to Chief Dawn
right away, please.

41:41.293 --> 41:44.836
No, I tried his cell.
He's not answering.

41:44.936 --> 41:48.079
Can you radio him?
It's important.

41:48.179 --> 41:50.321
Wait, what do...

41:50.421 --> 41:51.843
What do you mean,
he's not on duty today?

41:51.943 --> 41:54.045
I talked to him earlier.

41:54.145 --> 41:57.188
No, he told me he was
investigating a car accident.

42:02.272 --> 42:03.854
Hey!

42:03.954 --> 42:07.297
Issue an APB on Sommerdale
Police Chief Travis Dawn!

42:07.397 --> 42:09.379
And I want roadblocks
along state lines.

42:09.479 --> 42:11.481
Now!

42:13.162 --> 42:15.164
Excuse me. Could we...?

42:18.047 --> 42:19.228
Oh, for
God's sake, Marcus.

42:19.328 --> 42:21.910
Just bear with me, okay?

42:22.010 --> 42:23.872
I don't know how you're
gonna hear anything in here.

42:23.972 --> 42:25.834
Okay, go for it.

42:25.934 --> 42:28.917
Okay, um...

42:29.017 --> 42:30.758
So, when you get to
the end of your novel...

42:30.859 --> 42:31.960
Mm-hmm.

42:32.060 --> 42:33.241
...you wanna make sure
you give your readers

42:33.341 --> 42:34.482
one last twist.

42:34.582 --> 42:35.403
Thank you.

42:35.503 --> 42:36.404
One last twist?

42:36.504 --> 42:38.325
Yes, you wanna...

42:38.425 --> 42:40.047
you wanna keep 'em
on tenterhooks

42:40.147 --> 42:41.328
until the very end.

42:41.428 --> 42:42.930
Uh-huh.

42:43.030 --> 42:45.132
It's like cards.

42:45.232 --> 42:46.173
So you wanna keep
your trump card

42:46.273 --> 42:48.335
till the very last round.

42:48.435 --> 42:51.097
Okay.

42:51.197 --> 42:53.179
Keep your trump card
until the very last round.

42:53.279 --> 42:54.100
Cheers.

42:54.200 --> 42:55.021
Cheers. Cheers.

42:55.121 --> 42:57.123
Cheers to that,
Professor Quebert.

42:58.404 --> 43:00.065
Good afternoon.

43:00.165 --> 43:02.367
Afternoon.

43:03.889 --> 43:05.911
Is this a special vacation
for the two of you?

43:06.011 --> 43:06.992
Yeah, it is.

43:07.092 --> 43:08.873
It's... anniversary.

43:08.973 --> 43:10.975
Oh, lovely.

43:13.217 --> 43:15.219
[beeping]

43:16.100 --> 43:18.122
If you could wait
one moment,

43:18.222 --> 43:21.065
I... just need to check
something about your seats.

43:25.429 --> 43:27.430
I don't like this, Travis.

43:29.432 --> 43:31.434
