00:03.003 --> 00:05.906
You might be able to help me
with a problem my boss has.

00:05.906 --> 00:08.342
Something was taken from him,
and he wants it back,

00:08.342 --> 00:09.843
along with the people
that took it.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.080
Where's your girlfriend?
Paige.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.314
I don't have what
you're looking for.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.183
- She took it and left.
- Took what?

00:15.183 --> 00:16.950
The $15 million.

00:16.950 --> 00:18.752
I'm looking for a woman.
Have you seen her?

00:18.752 --> 00:21.922
- Her name's Paige.
- No, I haven't seen her.

00:21.922 --> 00:23.224
I saw Paige's journal,

00:23.224 --> 00:24.892
so I know a seed phrase
when I see one.

00:24.892 --> 00:27.961
If you're in any kind of
trouble, you need to tell me.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.498
Years ago, my neighbor's son's
girlfriend disappeared.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.933
- Was she found?
- Her heart had been cut out.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.435
Paige's bag.
I found it in the woods.

00:34.435 --> 00:35.569
Wait.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.271
You said Paige's stuff
was gone.

00:37.271 --> 00:39.273
- Help!
- E-Easy, now.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.341
Help!

00:57.091 --> 00:58.359
Huh?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.202
Cass?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.085
What the hell?

02:00.288 --> 02:02.856
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

03:08.656 --> 03:11.191
Mary? Mary?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.461
- Oh, God.
- Mary!

03:13.461 --> 03:17.197
Oh. Oh, God.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.000
What have you done?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.503
I don't know.
I just--

03:22.503 --> 03:25.005
I didn't--
I didn't-- I'm sorry.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.307
She was gonna hurt you.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.776
I was handling it, Buck!

03:28.776 --> 03:30.978
How were you handling it,
Sunny?

03:30.978 --> 03:32.680
Oh. G--

03:32.680 --> 03:34.515
She found Paige's bag,

03:34.515 --> 03:36.450
the one you buried
to protect Walter.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.886
Yeah, I know about that.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.525
You need to tell me
the truth.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.026
Did Walter kill Paige?

03:47.795 --> 03:50.464
- Did he?!
- I don't know.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.599
Honestly?

03:51.599 --> 03:54.034
He might have.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.338
We gotta think fast,
or this whole situation

03:57.338 --> 03:59.773
is gonna go
straight to hell.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.376
She was onto you.
She would have ruined us.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.877
She might still.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.279
Well, you got any ideas?

04:08.416 --> 04:10.851
You know who's been spending
time with that girl?

04:10.851 --> 04:12.085
Luke.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.989
Luke.

04:15.989 --> 04:20.193
I never did buy into his story
about Paige walking off.

04:20.193 --> 04:21.695
Shoot,
the story's half told.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.564
All we gotta do
is finish it.

04:32.306 --> 04:33.774
All right, thanks.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.509
Hey, any luck
on the security cam?

04:35.509 --> 04:37.244
No, the guy was wearing
a ski mask.

04:37.244 --> 04:39.279
He did, uh, gash his arm, though,

04:39.279 --> 04:40.548
when he busted the glass.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.450
- Well, that explains the blood.
- And he took his glove off,

04:42.450 --> 04:44.117
so if we're lucky,
we get a print.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.786
Looks like he went
through the files

04:45.786 --> 04:47.254
of the Bleeding Heart murder.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.822
- Huh.
- Yeah.

04:52.326 --> 04:55.329
- Uh, we should, um--
- Yeah.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.565
Denise, come here.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.669
I'm sorry.

05:01.669 --> 05:02.803
We'll get
to the bottom of this.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.905
- I promise. Okay?
- Okay.

05:04.905 --> 05:08.175
Hey, you okay?

05:08.175 --> 05:10.744
I don't know. No.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.280
Just brings it all back.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.983
Your dad.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.251
Yeah.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.156
Bring your stuff
by the Sheriff's Station.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.393
I'm gonna make space
for you, okay?

05:25.393 --> 05:27.260
You can work this case
from there.

05:27.260 --> 05:28.829
Okay, thanks.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.065
Do we have any idea
what triggered this?

05:33.367 --> 05:35.436
Uh, yeah. I do.

05:35.436 --> 05:36.570
Yeah?

05:36.570 --> 05:40.173
Yeah,
I posted this message

05:40.173 --> 05:42.342
on this online forum

05:42.342 --> 05:45.078
that was dedicated
to the Bleeding Heart Murder.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.180
Yeah, we've been
trying to link it

05:47.180 --> 05:48.616
to Mark Woodman's death.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.919
My post was the first one
since like 2012,

05:51.919 --> 05:53.921
- and then this happened.
- Wow, okay.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.423
So whoever did this

05:55.423 --> 05:57.725
had their notifications set up
for that forum.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.727
The question is,
what were they waiting for?

05:59.727 --> 06:01.662
Attention.

06:01.662 --> 06:04.398
I mean, clearly,
we're onto something.

06:04.398 --> 06:07.635
Our backpacker ends up dead,
last seen at Deadman's Drop,

06:07.635 --> 06:09.803
same place
the girl was found.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.806
So we think the
Bleeding Heart killer's back?

06:12.806 --> 06:15.075
Maybe he never left.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.738
This was supposed to be
a simple job.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.874
Tell me about this man
in the woods.

06:46.874 --> 06:50.377
Like I said, weird vibes.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.145
What are you thinking?

06:52.145 --> 06:54.214
I'm worried our employer
double-booked us,

06:54.214 --> 06:56.850
or there are other people
looking for Paige and Luke.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.019
Neither scenario
is good for us.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.988
Tell me about it.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.390
And now this.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.595
You're quite the shot
with a bow and arrow.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.530
I'm good
with ranged weapons.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.699
Seemed to me you were the one
hitting all the bull's-eyes.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.467
Believe me,

07:13.467 --> 07:15.903
it's one of the very few skills
that I have.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.471
Mm.

07:17.471 --> 07:20.140
How did Luke do?

07:20.140 --> 07:24.244
Luke? Not so sure.
Why do you ask?

07:24.244 --> 07:25.646
You seem to be spending

07:25.646 --> 07:28.048
a lot of time with him,
that's all.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.618
Not sure what that means.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.152
Just you're very friendly
with him.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.056
Avery, right?

07:36.056 --> 07:37.424
Mm.

07:37.424 --> 07:40.861
Why don't you ask
what you want to ask?

07:40.861 --> 07:43.363
Very well.

07:44.565 --> 07:47.467
You're clearly not here
for the camping.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.671
No, I'm enjoying
the camping.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.174
What do you know
about Luke?

07:55.275 --> 07:57.945
I know he's in trouble.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.447
And I'm guessing that
you're part of that.

08:00.447 --> 08:04.618
It seems there is quite a lot
at stake, isn't there?

08:07.020 --> 08:08.789
Is that a threat?

08:08.789 --> 08:10.958
Maybe.
Maybe not.

08:10.958 --> 08:15.362
Just want you to know that
I've... got my eye on you.

08:15.362 --> 08:16.764
Oh.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.498
Well, that's cryptic,
isn't it?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.534
Hmm.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.202
Well...

08:23.904 --> 08:25.573
...lovely chatting
with you both.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.580
What the hell
was that?

08:33.981 --> 08:36.617
I'm not quite sure.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.527
So what's the plan?

08:47.527 --> 08:49.930
Okay, what about this?

08:49.930 --> 08:52.499
We bring the campers
up here tonight

08:52.499 --> 08:54.001
on a night hike

08:54.001 --> 08:56.103
and discover
the body together.

08:56.103 --> 08:59.539
That way, it looks like
Mary found Paige's bag,

08:59.539 --> 09:02.009
- confronts Luke--
- And he killed her.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.376
That's right.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.879
How do you plan on getting
all the campers way up here?

09:05.879 --> 09:08.415
Well, thank God
it's a supermoon tonight,

09:08.415 --> 09:10.684
so I'll propose
a night hike.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.553
We've never done that, Sunny.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.590
Yeah, I know, but we'll make it
a special occasion.

09:16.590 --> 09:19.426
I'm gonna go
back down to camp

09:19.426 --> 09:20.761
and take care
of Paige's cellphone.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.095
- All right.
- Okay?

09:22.095 --> 09:24.197
- Yeah.
- I just hate this.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.633
I just hate it.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.484
Pretty sharp girl.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.591
I admire that.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.766
Starting here,
Blaire Lucan, 18 years old,

10:32.766 --> 10:35.335
the only daughter of Josie
and Del Lucan.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.004
Murdered May 2002.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.339
Blaire went missing
at an after-prom party

10:39.339 --> 10:41.174
at the Basin trailhead,

10:41.174 --> 10:44.044
and her body was found
before dawn at Deadman's Drop.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.779
Heart was carved out.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.380
Forensics said that
the knife used

10:47.380 --> 10:49.249
had a curved blade
like this one.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.784
The knife was never found.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.552
Okay, so with all these
cold-case files,

10:52.552 --> 10:54.187
what was
the working theory?

10:54.187 --> 10:56.924
Lots of dead ends,
but there was this.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.560
Detectives thought
that Blaire's death

11:00.560 --> 11:02.730
- might not be a one-off.
- Hmm.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.331
Denise mentioned a link
to other killings.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.767
- How many?
- Three in this region alone.

11:06.767 --> 11:07.968
Possibly others.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.170
All happened before Blaire,
all still unsolved.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.172
So our guy
could be anybody?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.441
What about the original suspects
they questioned?

11:14.441 --> 11:15.608
There was one that looked
good for it,

11:15.608 --> 11:18.611
- but he died two years ago.
- Any others?

11:18.611 --> 11:20.147
There's...

11:20.147 --> 11:21.581
Let's see.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.155
What the hell?

11:28.155 --> 11:30.157
One of the suspect files
is missing.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.759
How's that?

11:31.759 --> 11:33.326
Person of Interest "D."

11:33.326 --> 11:34.561
See who checked it out last.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.666
"RC."

11:39.666 --> 11:43.170
RC?

11:43.170 --> 11:45.105
Roman Cobb.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.440
He was the first detective
on the scene that night.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.776
He's retired now.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.978
He tampered with evidence.
The question is why.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.246
Well, let's pay him a visit
and ask him why.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.418
Wait a minute.
What is this?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.055
Okay,
you see this heart?

12:02.055 --> 12:03.957
This was taken
at the Basin trailhead,

12:03.957 --> 12:05.725
same place that
Blaire went missing.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.061
I saw one just like it
last night

12:08.061 --> 12:10.563
where the truck burned up,
freshly carved.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.200
I've been--
I've been mapping

12:13.200 --> 12:14.835
some of them
this morning.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.870
Any up by where
the backpacker disappeared?

12:16.870 --> 12:18.538
Pretty close.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.672
Didn't you say
there was a heart

12:19.672 --> 12:21.008
carved into the figurine
that was left

12:21.008 --> 12:23.710
- on the backpacker's body?
- Yeah.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.645
Okay, so he starts
carving hearts again

12:25.645 --> 12:26.980
after all these years?

12:26.980 --> 12:28.748
Maybe this is his
hunting ground.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.018
Maybe I should pull Emily
out of that camp.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.020
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the trailhead,

12:33.020 --> 12:34.721
see if I can find
this heart.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.089
- Don't go alone.
- Yeah.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.375
Owners catch you tearing
the place apart,

12:55.375 --> 12:57.244
you'll have hell to pay.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.512
You scared me to death.

12:59.512 --> 13:02.149
- When did you get back?
- Just now.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.783
Oh, yeah.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.654
Oh, well, I lost an earring
the other night.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.923
I was just looking for it.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.424
Right.

13:11.424 --> 13:15.863
So why are you tiptoeing
around my campsite?

13:15.863 --> 13:17.464
Looking for Dad.
You see him?

13:17.464 --> 13:19.066
No, no.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.934
Uh, last I heard,

13:20.934 --> 13:22.903
he was out
checking the horses.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.138
Um, I need you
to do me a favor.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.240
Would you go back
into town

13:27.240 --> 13:30.878
and get your father's refill
at the pharmacy?

13:30.878 --> 13:34.114
What, now?
It can't wait till tomorrow?

13:34.114 --> 13:36.950
No, it can't wait
till tomorrow.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.886
It's his blood pressure medicine.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.653
You don't want to gamble
with that, do ya?

13:40.653 --> 13:43.223
- No.
- No.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.691
Yeah. Okay.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.426
Well, I gotta go get
with the cook.

13:46.426 --> 13:49.396
We need some picnic baskets
for the hike tonight.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.231
- A night hike?
- Yeah.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.933
That's not
on the schedule.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.635
Yeah, we just found out
that there's a supermoon.

13:55.635 --> 13:56.970
Don't want to miss that.

13:56.970 --> 14:00.607
You be careful driving.
See ya later.

14:16.756 --> 14:19.859
Our friend Avery knows
about Luke, Paige,

14:19.859 --> 14:20.928
and the $15 million.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.429
I don't know how much,
but he knows.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.764
There's no such thing
as a simple fetch job.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.766
Yeah, well, we took the job.
We've got to finish it.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.101
Or?

14:28.101 --> 14:30.170
Or what?

14:32.672 --> 14:33.941
Let's hear it.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.148
We cut our losses.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.549
I'm serious.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.551
These aren't
the type of folks

14:44.551 --> 14:46.519
that take kindly
to quitters, Donno.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.720
You know that.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.791
What has gotten into you?

14:51.791 --> 14:54.928
It's just...

14:54.928 --> 14:57.764
We got a good thing
going now.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.899
Two businesses,
a real life.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.504
I've never had anything
to lose before.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.008
Okay.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.280
How about this
for a compromise?

15:15.115 --> 15:17.717
Let's go back to town,
set a meeting,

15:17.717 --> 15:22.022
and tell our employer
he needs to double our fee.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.860
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.596
Yeah.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.068
I was gonna save this
for your birthday.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.107
But I think
you could use it now.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.080
It's a good one.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.016
It's nice balance,

15:49.016 --> 15:51.418
light recoil,
easy to conceal.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.756
It's beautiful, Donno.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.762
Always one case
that keeps you up at night.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.831
Oh, yeah. I've got a few
of those, Mr. Cobb.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.333
Then you must know
how it feels,

16:06.333 --> 16:08.568
you two coming up here
after all this time.

16:08.568 --> 16:11.438
You took a file.
How come?

16:11.438 --> 16:12.805
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.108
Suspect in the Blaire Lucan
case, Suspect "D."

16:15.108 --> 16:17.910
You signed out the file
and you never returned it.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.312
- So what if I did?
- You've no business

16:19.312 --> 16:21.114
keeping evidence
from a case file.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.116
I know how it looks,
all right?

16:23.116 --> 16:24.751
But I had my reasons.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.187
- Did someone pay you?
- They tried.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.656
Hell, if I hadn't taken it,
they would have destroyed it.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.325
So somebody was trying
to protect this Suspect "D"?

16:32.325 --> 16:35.495
- Who was it?
- Why should I trust you two?

16:36.529 --> 16:39.066
Well, why hang on to information
like this all these years

16:39.066 --> 16:41.468
if you didn't expect
someone like us showing up?

16:43.103 --> 16:46.306
We want to solve this case,
Mr. Cobb,

16:46.306 --> 16:48.208
and I think you do, too.

16:49.776 --> 16:53.113
All right. So why don't you
tell me what you got?

16:53.113 --> 16:55.148
We believe the killer
is active again.

16:57.284 --> 16:58.951
I knew
this wasn't finished.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.987
Well, then
help us finish it.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.895
You're lucky.
I got it right here.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.963
Here's your missing suspect.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.166
I keep the originals
in a safe place.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.834
Blaire's boyfriend?

17:14.834 --> 17:17.370
- Yeah.
- Joe Walker.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.038
His father, Hiram Walker,

17:19.038 --> 17:21.508
was the City Commissioner
in 2002.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.244
Okay, all right.
So a powerful father

17:24.244 --> 17:26.713
trying to bury evidence
to protect his son.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.649
Classmates said
that Joe and Blaire

17:29.649 --> 17:31.251
had a big fight
at the dance

17:31.251 --> 17:33.986
and that he was unaccounted for
at the time she disappeared?

17:33.986 --> 17:37.124
Yeah, and he said he was passed
out drunk in his truck,

17:37.124 --> 17:39.159
but no one could
corroborate his story.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.560
And you don't believe him,
do you?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.462
So why not go after him?

17:42.462 --> 17:45.298
Hiram Walker was ruthless.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.899
What do you mean?

17:46.899 --> 17:50.403
When I refused to let it go,
he had me put on desk duty,

17:50.403 --> 17:53.306
saw to it that
my ex-wife lost her job.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.875
So I sat on that file
all this time,

17:55.875 --> 17:57.510
hoping that something
would come along

17:57.510 --> 17:59.679
to link Joe to the murder.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.115
Mr. Cobb, listen to me.

18:02.115 --> 18:05.084
We're gonna do our best
to solve this case, I promise.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.392
I appreciate that.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.693
Not a day goes by

18:13.693 --> 18:15.562
that I don't regret
not solving it.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.464
Thank you.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.203
Pops, I need an address
for a Joe Walker.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.937
No problem.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.074
And check his records for me,
will ya?

18:28.074 --> 18:29.409
You got it.
I'll send it to your phones.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.877
<i>Thanks.</i>

18:41.521 --> 18:44.691
Wait. That looks like
the tree and the rocks.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.295
Oh, yeah.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.929
Yep.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.466
Same weird red bark.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.236
Wait, check this out.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.938
That looks
like a heart, right?

18:58.938 --> 19:01.208
Mm-hmm.
It's been there a while.

19:01.208 --> 19:04.010
Yeah, well, 20 years,
if the killer carved it

19:04.010 --> 19:05.212
when they murdered Blaire.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.679
So, what?

19:06.679 --> 19:09.048
This is like a signature
or something?

19:09.048 --> 19:11.651
The killer leaving
their mark?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.353
Or it's some kind of map.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.022
This is the fifth tree carving
I've seen in the area.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.059
Oh, what is that?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.031
It's a bumblebee.

19:26.966 --> 19:31.137
Bumblebee-- "B."

19:31.137 --> 19:32.505
Blaire.

19:33.573 --> 19:34.874
Blaire.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.809
Clearly,
this was planted,

19:36.809 --> 19:38.311
and the killer
wanted us to find it.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.646
Do you think
it belonged to her?

19:39.646 --> 19:41.814
We need to contact her family
and find out.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.350
If it does belong
to Blaire,

19:43.350 --> 19:45.051
then the killer
kept it as a trophy

19:45.051 --> 19:47.086
and now he's taunting us.

19:55.328 --> 19:58.365
What happened?
You go for a swim?

19:58.365 --> 19:59.632
Well, almost.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.634
I-I got some mud
on me back there.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.370
I was just washing up.
Where you headed?

20:03.370 --> 20:05.438
Mom's got me headed back
to town

20:05.438 --> 20:07.807
to, uh, pick up
your blood pressure pills.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.208
Apparently you let them
run out again?

20:09.208 --> 20:10.443
Yeah, well,
you know what they say.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.312
Memory's
the first thing to go.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.846
That's funny.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.549
I highly recommend you do
what your mother says, though.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.185
Yeah.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.187
You hear about this night hike
she's organizing?

20:21.187 --> 20:22.555
Oh, yeah.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.191
Moon is gonna
look spectacular.

20:25.191 --> 20:26.693
I don't remember
doing that ever.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.929
Well, it's good to try
new things, son.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.532
You know, it keeps
the mind sharp.

20:32.532 --> 20:35.134
You know, maybe I should stay,
just to help out.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.969
I think
we got it covered,

20:36.969 --> 20:39.138
but I'll see you
when you get back.

20:39.138 --> 20:42.174
- Okay.
- All right.

20:55.688 --> 21:01.328
<i>Down in the valley ♪</i>

21:01.328 --> 21:05.498
<i>The valley so low ♪</i>

21:07.567 --> 21:13.506
<i>Hang your head over ♪</i>

21:13.506 --> 21:19.346
<i>Hear the wind blow ♪</i>

21:19.346 --> 21:25.184
<i>Hear the wind blow, love ♪</i>

21:25.184 --> 21:29.622
<i>Hear the wind blow ♪</i>

21:30.890 --> 21:36.496
<i>Hang your head over ♪</i>

21:36.496 --> 21:40.567
<i>Hear the wind blow ♪</i>

21:43.770 --> 21:45.137
Ma'am.

21:47.374 --> 21:48.908
What's all this?

21:48.908 --> 21:51.110
Oh, I bought out the place
for a few hours

21:51.110 --> 21:53.112
so we could have
some privacy.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.882
Privacy, huh?

21:55.882 --> 21:58.084
These are
my, uh, partners.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.953
Tex, finest tracker west
of the Mississippi

22:00.953 --> 22:03.590
and above-average
guitar player.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.558
Nice to meet you,
Miss Tonya.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.829
And this here is Possum.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.832
Now, you might be thinking,
"What's a handsome young fella

22:12.832 --> 22:14.967
like this doing
with a nickname like 'Possum'?"

22:16.002 --> 22:18.938
Possum does his business
at night.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.507
Ain't that right?

22:20.507 --> 22:21.908
Night time's
the right time.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.743
Night time
is the right time.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.412
You got a pouch?

22:27.279 --> 22:29.682
- I got this.
- He got this.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.150
What'd I say about that?

22:31.150 --> 22:33.586
- Don't.
- Right.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.522
What about the weirdo?

22:35.522 --> 22:37.824
He's mostly nice
and then not.

22:39.792 --> 22:43.830
That's quite the team.
Okay, shall we?

22:43.830 --> 22:46.098
Well, aren't you
full of cute?

22:46.098 --> 22:47.667
Hot damn.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.503
Tony,
you should have warned us.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.104
A real professional woman.

22:52.104 --> 22:55.274
Possum, what did
I tell you, huh?

22:55.274 --> 22:58.645
- Manners.
- I'm sorry, sir.

23:00.279 --> 23:02.314
Now, let's start
with the complications.

23:02.314 --> 23:06.986
Well, when you hired us,
you failed to mention

23:06.986 --> 23:10.256
that there are $15 million
at stake.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.791
You also failed to say

23:11.791 --> 23:14.226
that there are other people
looking for it.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.196
Double the danger,
double the fee.

23:17.196 --> 23:19.131
It's not the job
we signed up for.

23:20.867 --> 23:25.505
Hell. Honey, this ain't
the life I signed up for.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.639
Possum, neither.

23:26.639 --> 23:29.175
He wanted to go into--
What was it now, P?

23:29.175 --> 23:30.877
Artisanal pickling
and BMX.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.378
I like speed.

23:32.378 --> 23:35.982
And, Tex, what was it
you wanted to do?

23:35.982 --> 23:39.919
Oh, you know.
Haberdashery, mostly.

23:39.919 --> 23:43.556
And Winston is doing exactly
what he should be doing.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.725
We don't care about
your hobbies.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.660
Except the pickles.

23:47.660 --> 23:51.464
Now, who are all these
other people looking for them?

23:51.464 --> 23:56.002
One of the campers.
His name is Avery McCallister.

23:56.002 --> 23:59.071
We looked into him.
Shady finance guy.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.640
He knows about the money, too.

24:00.640 --> 24:05.945
We found Luke.
We can hand him over tonight.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.915
But Paige is gone.

24:08.915 --> 24:12.051
Gone as in dead
or taken leave?

24:14.120 --> 24:15.154
Unclear.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.056
Always a wrinkle.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.458
I told you there was
gonna be a wrinkle.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.695
I'll tell you what.
You two kill Luke,

24:22.695 --> 24:25.231
and then we'll go have
a look-see for Paige.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.366
Killing Luke was never
part of the agreement.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.736
It is now.

24:29.736 --> 24:32.438
Take the money,
take the ride.

24:32.438 --> 24:34.574
Tex dropping wisdom.

24:34.574 --> 24:38.878
You know, businesses burn down
so easy these days.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.149
Sometimes
with the owners inside.

24:55.294 --> 24:56.963
If you're looking
for your new besties,

24:56.963 --> 24:59.599
Cutie and the Creep,
they went into town.

24:59.599 --> 25:02.034
Wait,
Tonya and Donno left?

25:03.202 --> 25:06.005
- How do you know that?
- Saw them on their way out.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.541
Said there was a problem
at the restaurant or something.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.643
Are they--
Are they coming back?

25:10.643 --> 25:13.780
Yeah,
I think Tonya said

25:13.780 --> 25:16.315
she'd be back
for the night hike.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.517
Why?

25:22.088 --> 25:23.890
You look terrified.

25:25.224 --> 25:30.296
Listen, there are some
bad people on this trip.

25:30.296 --> 25:34.000
If you want my advice,
get the hell out of here.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.669
I know I am.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.373
What are you--
Luke!

26:01.861 --> 26:04.864
All those hopes and dreams
in high school--

26:04.864 --> 26:06.332
this is where
that fresh-faced kid

26:06.332 --> 26:08.668
- in a tux ends up.
- That fresh-faced kid

26:08.668 --> 26:09.869
could have killed
three other people

26:09.869 --> 26:11.270
- before he killed Blaire.
- I know.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.839
I'm just having a hard time
thinking about a teenager

26:12.839 --> 26:13.940
going state to state,
killing people.

26:13.940 --> 26:17.009
But then again, the world
is full of all sorts.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.078
Hey, Ted Bundy started playing
with knives when he was 3.

26:30.790 --> 26:34.326
Joe Walker?
Sheriff's Department.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.062
Anybody home?

26:39.231 --> 26:41.834
Wonderful.
He's cooking meth.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.105
Sheriff's Department.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.476
Aah!

27:31.017 --> 27:32.819
Hiya, Joe.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.456
Possession, assault,

27:37.456 --> 27:39.826
assault with a deadly weapon, vandalism.

27:39.826 --> 27:42.461
My, my,
you have been busy, Joe.

27:42.461 --> 27:43.830
Why don't you start
by telling us

27:43.830 --> 27:45.131
what happened
with that hand?

27:45.131 --> 27:46.665
Burnt it.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.836
- Hazards of cooking meth.
- Yeah, well, it got infected.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.739
You wanna take a look?

27:52.739 --> 27:54.306
I'll pass.

27:54.306 --> 27:57.143
Where were you this afternoon
around 3:00, 4:00?

27:57.143 --> 28:00.179
I don't know. I was taking
care of things at the ranch.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.680
Anybody working
with you today,

28:01.680 --> 28:03.682
somebody who could verify
where you were?

28:03.682 --> 28:06.418
Look, if you're gonna bust me,
will you just do it?

28:06.418 --> 28:09.355
You're not here because
of your janky meth lab, Joe.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.323
Then why am I here?!

28:11.323 --> 28:12.759
There was a break-in
at a local P.I. office,

28:12.759 --> 28:14.160
Dewell and Hoyt.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.296
What does that
got to do with me?

28:17.296 --> 28:19.732
Well, they just re-opened
the Bleeding Heart Murder case.

28:22.101 --> 28:25.304
Now,
the person who broke in...

28:25.304 --> 28:27.473
left them a little message,

28:27.473 --> 28:30.977
said "Come and get me,"
and it was written in blood.

28:30.977 --> 28:33.412
Says here
a patrol officer

28:33.412 --> 28:34.546
found you a few weeks ago,

28:34.546 --> 28:38.751
passed out in your truck
down by the Basin trailhead.

28:38.751 --> 28:39.986
What were you doing there?

28:39.986 --> 28:43.155
They questioned me
20 years ago.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.027
I didn't kill Blaire.
I loved her.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.361
Witness statements
have you fighting

28:49.361 --> 28:50.496
with her the night
she was killed.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.865
It wasn't a fight.

28:52.865 --> 28:53.966
Check the file.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.401
I was trying
to console her, man.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.904
Console? Is that another word
for shutting her up?

28:57.904 --> 29:00.239
What happened that night, hmm?
What did you do to her?

29:00.239 --> 29:02.508
Nothing.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.818
- Hey, Sunny.
- Oh.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.986
Hey, um,
have you seen Emily?

29:13.986 --> 29:15.287
Uh, can't say I have.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.123
Well, she went
to get a snack,

29:17.123 --> 29:19.558
but that was an hour ago,
and she's not in the mess tent.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.593
Well, I'll keep an eye
out for her.

29:21.593 --> 29:25.064
I'm sure she's found her a nice
place with a wonderful view.

29:25.064 --> 29:28.367
- Yeah, okay. Thanks.
- You bet.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.109
Where is he?

29:37.109 --> 29:39.278
Bathroom?
With Mary, maybe?

29:39.278 --> 29:41.447
- I'll check.
- Wait!

29:41.447 --> 29:44.650
His bag... it's gone.

29:44.650 --> 29:48.154
Clothes too.
Son of a bitch ran.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.288
Talk about timing.

29:50.823 --> 29:52.158
This is bad.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.026
This is very bad.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.528
Okay, he couldn't
have gotten far.

29:56.528 --> 29:57.696
I want you
to go look for him.

29:57.696 --> 29:59.899
- You're not coming?
- No.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.968
I got to keep an eye out
for that Avery dude.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.476
Yeah, that night, they pretended
like they were happy for us,

30:44.476 --> 30:47.713
taking all those photos
at their house.

30:47.713 --> 30:50.049
- The Lucans?
- Yeah.

30:50.049 --> 30:52.451
You know what Blaire
never told anyone?

30:52.451 --> 30:54.386
Not even her mom?

30:55.821 --> 30:57.389
She was scared of him.

30:57.389 --> 31:00.192
Scared of who?
Her father?

31:00.192 --> 31:02.094
Del held on
so damn tight.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.363
We were gonna leave
after graduation,

31:04.363 --> 31:08.500
and when he found out,
he lost it.

31:08.500 --> 31:09.835
Well, I'd be pretty pissed
if my daughter planned

31:09.835 --> 31:11.503
to cut out
with her boyfriend.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.639
Would you hurt her?

31:13.639 --> 31:14.773
What are you saying?

31:14.773 --> 31:17.910
Blaire had bruises on her arms
the night of the prom.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.513
Why do you think
she covered up?

31:21.513 --> 31:23.849
- Why didn't you tell anyone?
- I tried.

31:23.849 --> 31:25.851
No one believed me.

31:25.851 --> 31:27.819
And you were a suspect.

31:27.819 --> 31:30.822
Detective Cobb, man,
he had it out for me.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.891
Well, he had good reason.

31:34.961 --> 31:37.363
They questioned Del,
you know.

31:37.363 --> 31:38.965
They always question
the victim's parents.

31:38.965 --> 31:41.467
He said
he was out for a drive.

31:43.169 --> 31:44.870
I know
where he really was.

31:44.870 --> 31:49.475
He was stalking us
in his brand-new Chevy truck.

31:49.475 --> 31:51.843
An overprotective father
on prom night.

31:51.843 --> 31:53.212
That's hardly stalking.

31:53.212 --> 31:56.348
I think he had a plan.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.600
Hello, Mr. Lucan?

32:14.600 --> 32:17.403
My name is Cassie Dewell.
I left you a message.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.580
Mr. Lucan?

32:28.580 --> 32:31.283
I just really need to speak
with you.

33:16.795 --> 33:18.064
We need to get ahold
of Cassie

33:18.064 --> 33:19.665
and let her know
who we might be dealing with.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.500
She texted me
while we were in there.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.738
- Oh, no.
- What?

33:26.738 --> 33:27.973
She went
to Del Lucan's house.

33:27.973 --> 33:29.608
Oh, that's gonna be
a problem.

33:29.608 --> 33:31.510
We just got a match on the print
we pulled from the break-in.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.179
You probably know
what I'm gonna say next.

33:33.179 --> 33:35.314
- Del Lucan.
- When did she send the text?

33:35.314 --> 33:36.782
20 minutes ago.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.484
Straight to voicemail.

33:38.484 --> 33:41.087
Okay, I'll drive.
You keep calling her. Here.

33:41.087 --> 33:42.354
Hello?

34:22.561 --> 34:24.263
Well, what the hell?

34:26.432 --> 34:28.400
Mr. Lucan,
I'm Cassie Dewell.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.402
I got your message.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.970
Step back.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.374
Oh, you're gonna trespass
on my property

34:35.374 --> 34:36.808
and you want
to pull a gun on me?

34:39.077 --> 34:40.646
Naw.

34:46.152 --> 34:48.053
You're the one who broke
into our office.

34:48.053 --> 34:49.521
I had to get
your attention.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.690
You sure got mine

34:51.690 --> 34:55.327
with your post about
the Bleeding Heart Murder.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.796
So you left the pendant
for us to find?

34:57.796 --> 34:59.231
It was
your daughter's, right?

34:59.231 --> 35:02.168
I gave it to her
on her 12th birthday.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.704
She stopped wearing it, though.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.074
I don't get it.
What's with all the theater?

35:09.074 --> 35:10.242
The blood, the message?

35:10.242 --> 35:11.610
It worked, didn't it?

35:11.610 --> 35:13.279
What'd it take you,

35:13.279 --> 35:16.715
all of three,
four hours to get to me?

35:16.715 --> 35:19.451
Okay.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.687
I'm here.
I'm listening.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.559
You want to tell me
how it happened?

35:27.559 --> 35:30.429
Why did you kill Blaire?

35:30.429 --> 35:32.130
What?

35:33.799 --> 35:38.470
Y-You think
I killed my daughter?

35:38.470 --> 35:41.873
No.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.074
My God, no.

35:43.074 --> 35:46.445
I loved her.

35:46.445 --> 35:47.713
I loved my little girl.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.448
I would never hurt her.

35:49.448 --> 35:50.649
I--

35:50.649 --> 35:55.987
Her heart was carved out
of her body

35:55.987 --> 35:57.989
like some
butchered elk.

36:01.227 --> 36:03.161
I would never hurt
my little girl.

36:05.464 --> 36:07.366
But they forgot
about her.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.468
That's why
I collect all this.

36:09.468 --> 36:11.803
Someone needs
to keep looking.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.305
Okay, I hear you.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.646
Hands, now!

36:20.646 --> 36:22.781
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Back up.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.916
- You okay, Cassie?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

36:26.352 --> 36:28.620
The killer's
still out there.

36:36.895 --> 36:39.164
Luke!

36:40.999 --> 36:44.670
Anyone?!

36:50.642 --> 36:53.144
I'm fine, I'm fine.

36:53.144 --> 36:55.747
It's fine, it's fine,
it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.068
Mary?

37:17.068 --> 37:19.738
Oh, my God.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.745
Help me!

37:26.745 --> 37:29.080
Somebody help me please!

37:29.080 --> 37:31.249
Help!

37:34.453 --> 37:36.422
Aah!

37:36.422 --> 37:38.924
Emily.
What are you doing out here?

37:38.924 --> 37:41.493
You need to help!
Somebody killed her!

37:41.493 --> 37:44.195
- Killed who?
- Mary!

37:44.195 --> 37:46.432
She's dead!

37:46.432 --> 37:49.701
Show me.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.333
Hey.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.934
Who is this?

38:22.934 --> 38:24.470
That's some kid
they spotted in the woods

38:24.470 --> 38:27.506
the night of the afterparty,
the night Blaire was killed.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.074
And the police
did the composite sketch?

38:29.074 --> 38:31.810
Yeah, but he was
never seen again.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.645
How old
did they say he was?

38:33.645 --> 38:35.080
Teenager?

38:35.080 --> 38:37.683
What are you thinking?

38:37.683 --> 38:39.785
I think it's the guy
that I saw with the truck.

38:39.785 --> 38:40.819
Really?

38:40.819 --> 38:43.355
I mean, older,
but it's the same eyes.

38:47.359 --> 38:48.460
It's him.

38:48.460 --> 38:51.262
Okay, everyone.

38:51.262 --> 38:54.099
We've got 10 minutes
till the supermoon hike.

38:54.099 --> 38:56.402
Hey, I don't know
if we should wait for Mary.

38:56.402 --> 38:58.570
I haven't seen her
in hours.

38:58.570 --> 38:59.905
I think
she's off with Luke.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.673
Hmm, she could be.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.642
Those two are pretty tight.

39:03.642 --> 39:07.379
Okay, y'all be sure and get
you one of these flashlights.

39:07.379 --> 39:10.081
The moon's gonna brighten up
the trail quite a bit,

39:10.081 --> 39:11.750
but you'll want one, trust me.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.318
Okay?

39:13.318 --> 39:16.187
I still can't find Emily.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.589
Okay.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.090
No,
it's not okay, Avery.

39:19.090 --> 39:22.728
It's been over two hours.
I'm gonna call Beau.

39:22.728 --> 39:25.296
That's not a good idea.
Look, she's fine, all right?

39:25.296 --> 39:26.732
She's a responsible girl.

39:26.732 --> 39:29.067
She knows what time
we're supposed to leave at.

39:29.067 --> 39:30.569
- She's--
- Hey, Sunny?

39:30.569 --> 39:33.138
- Yeah?
- Did you see Emily anywhere?

39:33.138 --> 39:34.540
I still haven't found her.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.875
No, I haven't, hon.
I'm sorry.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.176
Okay, thanks.

39:38.176 --> 39:40.546
Yeah, uh-huh.

40:36.001 --> 40:38.570
Okay, we'll take care
of that tomorrow. Thanks.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.639
There's still no sign
of Emily.

40:40.639 --> 40:42.207
O-Okay, just calm down.

40:42.207 --> 40:43.642
Buck's up on the trail

40:43.642 --> 40:46.411
making a safety pass
for bears and whatnot.

40:46.411 --> 40:48.647
If Emily's up there,
he'll find her.

40:48.647 --> 40:49.815
Okay, well, I'm not
gonna go with you.

40:49.815 --> 40:52.017
I'm gonna stay here
in case she comes back.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.719
- Okay.
- You can go on with them

40:53.719 --> 40:56.021
- if you want to.
- Hey.

40:56.021 --> 40:59.024
Call the sheriff!

40:59.024 --> 41:01.126
Somebody killed Mary!

41:04.229 --> 41:06.431
- Emily?
- Mom.

41:06.431 --> 41:07.766
Emily.

41:07.766 --> 41:09.167
Emily, my God.

41:10.168 --> 41:11.937
Mary!

41:13.071 --> 41:14.806
Oh, my God! No.

41:14.806 --> 41:17.576
Buck, what happened?

41:17.576 --> 41:19.044
Emily found her.

41:23.281 --> 41:25.416
Are you okay?

41:25.416 --> 41:26.718
I don't know.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.723
Em,
is that Paige's bag?

41:33.091 --> 41:34.359
Yeah.

41:35.627 --> 41:36.895
Where's Luke?

41:36.895 --> 41:39.097
That's a good question.

41:39.097 --> 41:40.932
Buck?

41:40.932 --> 41:43.201
I don't know,
but somebody better find him.

42:04.222 --> 42:06.357
Hey, baby.

42:08.694 --> 42:10.095
Paige.

42:17.603 --> 42:18.870
Miss me?

42:58.810 --> 43:02.748
