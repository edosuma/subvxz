WEBVTT

01:16.535 --> 01:18.371
Pinch me, Eddie, I'm dreamin'.

01:18.454 --> 01:20.164
It's so big.

01:20.248 --> 01:21.999
Just like in the picture, Charlene.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.793
The Justice League Watchtower.

01:23.876 --> 01:26.170
Right here. Right in front of us.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.130
Think we'll see 'em, Dad?

01:28.214 --> 01:30.424
Son, the Justice League
has a few more important things

01:30.508 --> 01:31.968
to do than greet the tourists.

01:45.856 --> 01:46.856
Yah!

01:57.451 --> 01:59.036
<i>You win again, Micron.</i>

01:59.120 --> 02:00.663
<i>Best three out of five?</i>

02:03.124 --> 02:04.250
Later, buddy.

02:14.427 --> 02:16.095
<i>Calling Justice League Unlimited.</i>

02:16.178 --> 02:18.681
<i>Calling the JLU. We have an emergency.</i>

02:18.764 --> 02:19.764
Who is this?

02:20.016 --> 02:23.853
<i>We have a monorail out of control
in North-East District. Over and out.</i>

02:31.193 --> 02:32.695
Can't stop the acceleration.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.071
I gotta get off this thing.

02:40.578 --> 02:41.578
What?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.006
Hold on.

02:58.054 --> 03:00.449
There's no one onboard
but it's gonna hit the southbound 111.

03:00.473 --> 03:01.974
I'm way ahead of you.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.044
Force field.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.659
Our hunch paid off.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.577
Inque was after
the prototype battle pod.

04:03.661 --> 04:06.288
That figures. Any terrorist organization

04:06.372 --> 04:07.998
would pay a fortune for it.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.708
<i>Then I hope they didn't pay in advance.</i>

04:09.792 --> 04:11.232
'Cause they're not getting this one.

04:19.135 --> 04:20.135
What?

04:50.499 --> 04:51.667
Wait a minute.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.069
Okay, Batman, back off.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.071
Unless you wanna see me
put the squeeze on him.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.240
He's just an innocent bystander, Inque.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.700
Too bad for him.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.368
I'll take it from here, Batman.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.930
Superman.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.029
Good to see you, Bruce.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.572
It's been a while.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.617
You seem to be holding up pretty well.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.286
I could use some of that Kryptonian DNA.

06:09.370 --> 06:12.414
You'll outlive us all, Bruce.
You're too stubborn to die.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.917
What are you smiling at?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.168
Nothin'.

06:16.752 --> 06:18.629
Shall we cut through the chitchat?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.881
I know it wasn't Inque
that brought you to Gotham.

06:20.965 --> 06:23.634
I think it's time your protege
joined the Justice League.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.760
The Justice League?

06:24.843 --> 06:27.346
I can't help but consider the timing.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.682
Is he supposed to be
a replacement for Micron?

06:29.765 --> 06:31.767
No. This goes beyond that.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.019
I've watched him. I've studied him.

06:34.103 --> 06:35.437
He's proved his valor.

06:35.521 --> 06:36.855
His time has come, Bruce.

06:36.939 --> 06:38.357
What do you say?

06:38.440 --> 06:40.234
Oh, I don't think
it's my decision to make.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.363
The Justice League.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.251
This is League business.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.295
How dare you bring him in
without consulting us?

06:59.378 --> 07:01.797
It's completely against procedure.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.466
Batman was one of the League's
founding members.

07:04.550 --> 07:07.094
The real Batman.
Not this pointy-eared punk.

07:08.262 --> 07:09.346
I thought we were a team.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.099
Slaves on Apokolips
are treated with more respect.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.602
Please. Angerjust clouds the issue.

07:14.685 --> 07:17.104
Does it? My beak tells me this stinks.

07:17.187 --> 07:20.524
I'm afraid Barda and Warhawk
have a point. No offense.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.318
This isn't up for discussion.

07:22.401 --> 07:24.612
Like it or not, Batman stays.

07:36.415 --> 07:37.833
Just keep out of my way, junior.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.169
Hawks eat rodents like you
for breakfast.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.802
Maybe this was a mistake.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.971
No. I need someone I can trust.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.569
Micron's still hanging on,

08:05.653 --> 08:07.655
but his cellular structure
was severely damaged.

08:07.905 --> 08:08.947
Whoa!

08:09.031 --> 08:10.240
That was some accident.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.533
Wrong.

08:11.742 --> 08:14.078
Someone deliberately caused that wreck.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.996
And I think it was an inside job.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.080
What do you mean?

08:17.122 --> 08:19.541
I found this hidden on the monorail.

08:19.625 --> 08:22.503
Not even Micron could slip through
the force field it generates.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.254
But anyone could have
put it there, right?

08:24.338 --> 08:28.258
No, it contains technology
only the Justice League has access to.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.969
I can't believe it.
These guys are all big-time heroes.

08:31.053 --> 08:32.054
I know.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.139
But I can't take any chances.

08:34.223 --> 08:35.391
That's why I want you here.

08:35.474 --> 08:38.602
To spy on them?
Well, that's gonna make me real popular.

08:52.116 --> 08:53.575
Going over my file?

08:54.118 --> 08:55.452
Aquagirl.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.871
You can call me Marina.

08:57.955 --> 08:59.206
Marina.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.083
It's all a bit overwhelming.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.966
I don't think I got off
to a good start today.

09:03.043 --> 09:03.961
Give it time.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.797
Everyone's been on edge
since Micron's accident.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.298
I'm sorry.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.426
Occupational hazard, I guess.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.052
Wanna join me for a swim?

09:12.136 --> 09:13.637
Thanks, but I've gotta cram.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.472
This League stuff's still new to me.

09:15.556 --> 09:16.932
Maybe later.

09:50.507 --> 09:51.633
I can't do this.

09:51.717 --> 09:53.886
<i>- It's just too weird.</i>
- What <i>is?</i>

09:53.969 --> 09:55.554
I'm sitting here investigating people

09:55.637 --> 09:57.717
who have saved the world
more times than I can count.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.683
I've considered them
heroes my whole life.

09:59.767 --> 10:00.934
<i>What's your point?</i>

10:01.018 --> 10:03.687
How can one of them be a traitor?
It's impossible.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.106
Keep digging.
The answer's there somewhere.

10:06.190 --> 10:07.983
Yeah, but...

10:08.066 --> 10:09.443
Aquagirl.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.323
Terry?

10:26.627 --> 10:27.711
Marina.

10:56.698 --> 10:57.698
Great.

11:04.790 --> 11:07.376
Easy, Barda.
This is just a training session.

11:07.459 --> 11:10.087
Will our enemies go easy
when you face them in combat?

11:18.554 --> 11:19.805
My Mega Rod.

11:19.888 --> 11:20.888
Is he wacko?

11:40.951 --> 11:42.411
Marina.

11:42.494 --> 11:43.787
What did you do to her?

11:43.871 --> 11:46.540
It wasn't his fault.
The tank malfunctioned.

11:46.623 --> 11:47.875
I couldn't get out.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.543
Why didn't you call us on the intercom?

11:49.626 --> 11:51.461
- I didn't think...
- That's right.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.546
You didn't think.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.631
And it almost cost her her life.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.268
I heard what happened.

12:06.351 --> 12:09.062
I'm running a diagnostic
on the tank's operating system.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.194
There's the problem.

12:17.321 --> 12:18.906
This micro-controller's burned out.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.449
AII its circuits have been fused.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.076
Sabotage.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.580
This confirms it.
There's a traitor among us.

12:42.054 --> 12:43.805
They've got me out on fly-by patrol.

12:43.889 --> 12:46.075
I think they just wanted me
out of their little clubhouse.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.452
Not that I mind getting
away from the place.

12:47.476 --> 12:48.727
<i>Nobody wants me there.</i>

12:48.810 --> 12:49.811
Nobody?

12:49.895 --> 12:52.564
Well, maybe Aquagirl.

12:52.648 --> 12:54.292
But I had to save her life
to win her over.

12:54.316 --> 12:55.943
That's one way to make friends.

12:57.069 --> 12:59.947
Hold on. Something's coming
in on a JLU frequency.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.217
Look.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.290
The entire city's under attack.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.002
And no sign of who's doing it.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.586
I don't see any more firebombs.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.213
Check the buildings for victims.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.777
GL, you need backup?

14:20.861 --> 14:23.655
I've got the situation under control.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.160
Aquagirl,

14:29.202 --> 14:30.412
we've got some men overboard.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.666
I'm on it. Let's pick 'em up.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.397
There are victims on the roof.

15:39.481 --> 15:40.690
I'm there.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.042
I've got this, Kal.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.387
Jeez!

16:10.512 --> 16:11.346
The terminal roof.

16:11.513 --> 16:12.347
Stick with Warhawk.

16:12.430 --> 16:13.515
He needs your help.

16:14.850 --> 16:16.935
Yeah, right. Warhawk. My good buddy.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.325
Come on, come on. Move. Let's go.
Move it! Come on, come on!

17:00.520 --> 17:02.272
Building's empty.
How's it going, Warhawk?

17:02.355 --> 17:04.566
- Still two more on the roof.
<i>- I've</i> got <i>'em.</i>

17:08.653 --> 17:10.614
Finally making yourself useful.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.324
I'm gonna follow that signal.

17:12.407 --> 17:13.283
What signal?

17:13.366 --> 17:16.703
An emergency call. Didn't you hear it?
It was on our frequency.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.371
No. But I'll go with you.

17:18.455 --> 17:19.289
You stay here.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.249
I don't need an amateur tagging along.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.878
Superman said to stick with you
and I'm sticking.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.350
Oh, no.

17:56.701 --> 17:57.953
Nice save.

18:27.816 --> 18:28.900
Warhawk.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.323
What did you do?

18:35.407 --> 18:37.909
He got a call for help
on the JLU frequency.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.120
- We were following it here when...
- Who sent it?

18:40.203 --> 18:43.039
I didn't get any signal. Did you?

18:43.123 --> 18:44.666
Only Warhawk heard it.

18:44.749 --> 18:46.960
We only have your word
for that, don't we?

18:47.043 --> 18:48.086
Back off, Barda.

18:48.169 --> 18:50.171
Accusations won't get us anywhere.

18:50.255 --> 18:53.508
When we find out who set the bombs,
we'll find out who killed Warhawk.

18:56.845 --> 18:58.263
What do you expect to find?

18:58.346 --> 19:01.099
Ifl knew, Iwouldn't
have to look for it.

19:01.975 --> 19:05.145
He never had a chance.
Must have had a timer or somethin'.

19:05.437 --> 19:06.438
Maybe.

19:06.771 --> 19:07.771
Freeze frame.

19:09.524 --> 19:10.942
Reverse.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.528
Frame speed, one per second.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.238
Freeze.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.407
Spectral filters.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.783
Stop.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.202
Look at that.

19:21.619 --> 19:25.165
It was detonated from a remote
position by some kind of ray.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.248
But who?

19:26.458 --> 19:28.960
Shift view 60 degrees left.

19:30.712 --> 19:31.796
Close in.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.093
Superman.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.890
Superman's the traitor.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.434
Where are you going?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.686
I have to go back. Warn them.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.688
You have to do more than that.

20:07.832 --> 20:10.460
This isn't the first time
Superman's gone rogue.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.962
So I made sure I'd be ready
if it ever happened again.

20:13.838 --> 20:16.341
I always hoped I'd never have to use it.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.802
Kryptonite.

20:18.885 --> 20:22.097
This could kill him, right?

20:22.180 --> 20:24.099
Do whatever it takes

20:24.182 --> 20:25.809
but make sure you stop him.
