15:07.056 --> 15:09.148
What is that thing?

15:09.183 --> 15:11.117
Still none of your
goddamn business.

15:13.020 --> 15:15.863
It's leading you to something
beyond the wall.

15:15.940 --> 15:18.824
Or someone.

15:18.859 --> 15:21.327
Ok, you know what?
Reunion's over.

15:21.404 --> 15:22.995
Get out! Now!

15:23.072 --> 15:24.830
Hey! Hey, what're you doing?

15:24.865 --> 15:25.665
She's asking too many
goddamn questions

15:25.700 --> 15:26.666
and she's not answering
any of mine.

15:26.701 --> 15:29.418
It's 'cause she already answered
our questions.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.838
Your trust issues
aren't my problem.

15:32.873 --> 15:34.173
What's your angle?

15:34.208 --> 15:37.009
Why tag along?

15:37.086 --> 15:39.178
I like the company.

15:39.213 --> 15:40.763
Bullshit.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.014
And frankly, I don't care.

15:42.091 --> 15:44.934
Out! Now!

15:44.945 --> 15:46.277
She stays.

15:46.354 --> 15:48.321
End of discussion.

15:55.980 --> 15:58.114
That cloud you're avoiding?

15:58.124 --> 15:59.740
It's gonna take two hours
to move on

15:59.817 --> 16:01.701
and we're right at the edge of
the vampire territory

16:01.777 --> 16:02.961
I was telling you about.

16:03.037 --> 16:06.205
Staying here is suicide.

16:06.240 --> 16:11.469
But... I know where you can
find shelter.

16:21.005 --> 16:22.087
We're running low.

16:22.165 --> 16:25.391
There's vehicles on each side
of the main building.

16:25.426 --> 16:27.059
Alright, I'll go left.

16:27.094 --> 16:28.144
You and Nina go right.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.154
Hey, hey, hey.
Come here.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.817
Watch your back.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.828
It'll be fine.

16:38.189 --> 16:39.998
Trust me.

16:43.819 --> 16:48.047
Well, looks like it's just
you and... me.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.092
Nina?

16:54.455 --> 16:56.055
Nina?

16:58.292 --> 16:59.892
Oh boy.

17:03.297 --> 17:04.272
Nina?

17:07.134 --> 17:08.192
Nina!

17:12.532 --> 17:17.785
<i> [choking sounds]</i>

17:23.451 --> 17:28.954
<i> [choking sounds]</i>

17:28.989 --> 17:34.293
<i> [feeding sounds]</i>

17:34.328 --> 17:35.169
Nina!

17:37.891 --> 17:41.050
Don't you dare call me
a bottom feeder.

17:41.061 --> 17:44.887
You tricked us into coming here
for shelter so you could feed.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.898
Two birds, one stone.

17:46.974 --> 17:50.234
I need strength to protect you,
don't I?

17:50.311 --> 17:52.895
Axel's not gonna like this.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.480
Oh, Julius.

17:54.515 --> 17:56.315
Always a lap dog,
never the master.

17:56.350 --> 17:58.150
Hey!

17:58.185 --> 18:01.529
I am my own man,
always have been!

18:01.605 --> 18:03.489
Yeah?

18:03.524 --> 18:05.458
How's mama?

18:09.238 --> 18:10.329
<i> Mama: What did you do?</i>

18:10.364 --> 18:11.272
<i> What is this?</i>

18:11.349 --> 18:12.423
<i> Julius: It's a proper meal,</i>
<i> mama.</i>

18:12.500 --> 18:18.420
<i> I'm sorry it took so long</i>
<i> but it's healthy, clean blood.</i>

18:18.431 --> 18:20.256
Have you not learned
from your mistakes?

18:20.266 --> 18:23.676
We don't take the humans
that people will miss.

18:23.711 --> 18:25.511
No, mama.
Not anymore.

18:25.546 --> 18:28.013
We have nobody to protect us.

18:28.048 --> 18:30.349
Dmitri cast us off
because of you

18:30.384 --> 18:34.353
and now there's a vampire hunter
chasing us all.

18:34.388 --> 18:38.357
We're only alive because
we've stayed in the shadows.

18:38.392 --> 18:40.526
That time is over.

18:40.561 --> 18:42.495
For both of us.

18:47.651 --> 18:50.128
It's time that we return
to the old ways.

18:50.204 --> 18:51.129
Bah!

18:51.205 --> 18:53.372
The old ways are gone!

18:53.407 --> 18:56.125
You stupid, stupid child!

18:56.136 --> 18:58.544
Hit him again,
you lose your arm.

18:58.579 --> 18:59.545
Who are you?

18:59.580 --> 19:00.379
Get away from me!

19:00.414 --> 19:05.384
Mama, this is Nina.

19:05.419 --> 19:07.386
She's different.

19:07.421 --> 19:11.223
She lived a life of strife
and struggle like we did.

19:11.258 --> 19:12.984
But not anymore.

19:13.060 --> 19:15.978
Now, I am the night.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.062
[scoffs]

19:17.139 --> 19:18.397
You are a fool.

19:18.432 --> 19:19.565
Child, you can't-

19:19.600 --> 19:21.650
He's not a child!

19:21.661 --> 19:23.319
He is Julius.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.329
I will not be spoken
to like this.

19:25.406 --> 19:26.664
Least of all by her!

19:26.741 --> 19:28.666
Mama, please.

19:28.743 --> 19:32.170
She wants to build
a new territory.

19:32.246 --> 19:34.246
An empire.

19:34.281 --> 19:35.664
With me.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.416
No!

19:37.451 --> 19:40.344
She will bring death
to our door.

19:40.421 --> 19:42.087
Don't you understand?

19:42.164 --> 19:43.589
I do.

19:43.624 --> 19:46.759
Your fear is his burden.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.227
[snaps neck]

19:50.172 --> 19:53.599
It doesn't have to be.

19:53.676 --> 19:54.609
Julius?

19:56.696 --> 20:00.573
If you follow her
she will get you killed.

20:03.394 --> 20:05.277
Don't make me beg, Julius.

20:05.312 --> 20:09.281
If you leave what will happen
to me?

20:09.316 --> 20:13.211
I gave you life.

20:13.287 --> 20:14.587
Mama.

20:18.033 --> 20:19.967
I will die without you!

20:36.343 --> 20:38.903
You're better off.

20:38.980 --> 20:42.240
We're better off.

20:42.316 --> 20:44.909
You don't get it.

20:44.986 --> 20:47.486
She's all I got.

20:47.563 --> 20:50.414
You've got me now.

20:50.491 --> 20:54.660
And I promise I will never lie
to you.

20:54.695 --> 20:58.247
So listen to what I'm saying.

20:58.258 --> 21:03.877
We've shared so much
in such a short time.

21:03.954 --> 21:06.547
I snapped you out
of a nightmare.

21:06.623 --> 21:08.432
I know.

21:08.509 --> 21:13.262
I know, but she's my mama.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.514
And a vampire.

21:15.591 --> 21:21.520
When the hunger takes hold
she will feed without you.

21:21.555 --> 21:24.657
She will learn to fend
for herself.

21:35.652 --> 21:37.628
Guilt is a human emotion.

21:37.705 --> 21:39.913
It serves no purpose now.

21:39.990 --> 21:46.804
Let it die so you can be
the vampire I know you can be.

21:58.008 --> 22:00.225
Tomorrow at midnight.

22:00.302 --> 22:02.728
I'll wait for you
where we first met.

22:02.763 --> 22:05.731
And if you come to me

22:05.766 --> 22:08.442
we will be together forever.

22:08.519 --> 22:14.373
If not, then I'll know you can't
let go of the past.

22:26.787 --> 22:28.846
What do you say, sweetheart?

22:28.923 --> 22:30.556
Are you going to be
the lucky one?

22:50.036 --> 22:52.578
Breakfast of champions.

23:09.037 --> 23:11.722
You're getting twitchy
in your old age, Axel.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.468
[glass smashes]

23:16.503 --> 23:21.440
[gunfire]

23:33.154 --> 23:35.454
Son of a bitch!

23:40.027 --> 23:41.627
[gunfire]

23:43.197 --> 23:46.382
[gunfire]

23:50.838 --> 23:53.472
You're starting to piss me off!

23:55.101 --> 23:56.675
Tango one is pinned down.

23:56.710 --> 23:58.477
Move into flank.

24:14.811 --> 24:16.695
[explosion]

24:16.730 --> 24:19.331
Dammit, where are you?

24:35.716 --> 24:38.350
[gunfire]

24:50.931 --> 24:52.147
All hell's breaking loose.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.106
[door opens]

24:53.183 --> 24:54.775
We gotta go right      now!

24:54.851 --> 24:56.735
We got a team of soldiers
gunning for us.

24:56.770 --> 24:57.828
Well, ain't that a kick
in the head?

24:57.905 --> 25:00.498
I hitched a ride
with wanted men.

25:00.574 --> 25:01.499
Wait a second,

25:01.575 --> 25:03.075
how did you know there was
fresh blood here?

25:03.110 --> 25:04.618
This is your territory,
isn't it?

25:04.695 --> 25:06.745
Get that out of my face
before I kill you!

25:06.780 --> 25:07.929
I told you we couldn't
trust her.

25:07.931 --> 25:10.082
Your selfish bullshit,
let 'em catch right up to us.

25:10.117 --> 25:11.842
I know this looks bad
but there's no way

25:11.919 --> 25:12.951
she could have known
we were being tracked.

25:13.029 --> 25:15.128
What difference does it make?
They're here now!

25:15.205 --> 25:16.922
Probably sent by
President Dark One.

25:16.957 --> 25:18.632
And we have nowhere to go.

25:18.709 --> 25:20.100
[pounding]

25:23.964 --> 25:27.474
<i> Give us the vampire and you can</i>
<i> walk away from this!</i>

25:27.551 --> 25:28.817
They want her?

25:32.606 --> 25:34.189
Where'd she go?

25:34.200 --> 25:36.825
<i> You have 30 seconds to comply.</i>

25:44.651 --> 25:46.785
Time's up!

25:46.820 --> 25:49.421
-Spare her, kill them.
-10-4.

25:52.793 --> 25:54.960
[beeping]

25:54.995 --> 25:56.136
Gonna breach!

25:58.915 --> 26:00.849
[explosion]

26:07.141 --> 26:15.614
[gunfire]

26:25.326 --> 26:26.458
Duck!

26:26.860 --> 26:27.659
Down!

26:27.736 --> 26:29.003
[explosion]

26:47.631 --> 26:49.106
Fall back!

26:49.183 --> 26:51.066
[gunfire]

26:55.189 --> 26:56.280
Keep the gun on this one.

26:56.357 --> 26:57.656
You got it.

27:01.728 --> 27:03.787
It's not gonna take them long
to regroup.

27:03.864 --> 27:05.331
Axel?

27:09.820 --> 27:12.371
You gotta be kidding me.

27:12.447 --> 27:15.082
A vampire Delta Force.

27:15.158 --> 27:16.541
Goddamn apocalypse.

27:16.576 --> 27:18.710
Those orange bullets hurt,
don't they?

27:18.787 --> 27:19.820
Tell you what.

27:19.897 --> 27:23.515
I'll end your pain,
you tell me who sent you.

27:39.182 --> 27:39.782
[growls]

27:40.475 --> 27:41.608
Take it easy, Axel.

27:41.685 --> 27:43.160
She came back for us,
didn't she?

27:43.237 --> 27:45.404
She came back because I have
the keys to the SUV.

27:45.439 --> 27:47.823
Maybe I wanted to know more
about the magic orange bullets.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.408
Yeah, I got one of those magic
orange bullets

27:49.443 --> 27:51.576
for you right here.

27:51.653 --> 27:52.577
Axel.

27:52.612 --> 27:54.171
You wanted us to think
they were after us.

27:54.248 --> 27:55.914
Then you killed that vamp
before it could talk.

27:55.949 --> 27:56.781
Why?

27:56.859 --> 27:59.584
So it wouldn't unravel
your bullshit?

27:59.619 --> 28:00.919
Julius?

28:00.954 --> 28:02.587
Back your friend off.

28:02.622 --> 28:03.755
Or I will.

28:03.832 --> 28:06.517
Nina, what do you know?

28:06.593 --> 28:08.352
Hey.

28:08.429 --> 28:10.396
You swore you'd never
lie to me.

28:12.966 --> 28:15.100
You said it yourself.

28:15.177 --> 28:18.770
The Dark One has control
of the military.

28:18.847 --> 28:20.480
What does she want with you?

28:20.557 --> 28:22.858
[mimics] What does she want
with you?

28:22.868 --> 28:24.943
[laughs]

28:25.020 --> 28:26.486
We're on a mission to kill her.

28:26.563 --> 28:27.821
With Vanessa Van Helsing.

28:27.898 --> 28:28.205
Enough.

28:28.282 --> 28:29.248
[cocks gun]

28:30.284 --> 28:31.616
Ok!

28:31.651 --> 28:33.168
Point made.

28:35.214 --> 28:40.459
I know things about
the Dark One.

28:40.494 --> 28:41.885
That's vague as     .

28:41.962 --> 28:43.128
You think I'm gonna give
anything up

28:43.205 --> 28:45.222
just because you asked?

28:45.299 --> 28:47.224
It's the only leverage I've got.

28:47.301 --> 28:49.226
Maybe we lend each other a hand

28:49.303 --> 28:53.638
with this little predicament
and then maybe I talk.

28:53.715 --> 28:56.224
Look, there is a lot of them
out there.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.727
Maybe it is better
if we work together.

28:58.738 --> 29:02.448
Although we need a plan
to fight those goons.

29:04.744 --> 29:07.119
Maybe we just give them
what they want.

29:08.021 --> 29:09.455
<i> Nina: Help!</i>

29:11.024 --> 29:12.458
<i> Help!</i>

29:14.920 --> 29:16.628
Help!

29:20.334 --> 29:23.502
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me.

29:23.537 --> 29:26.254
Take me to the Dark One.
I can help her.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.839
Where are the humans?

29:27.874 --> 29:30.258
You think I did this to myself?

29:30.269 --> 29:31.843
They betrayed me!

29:31.920 --> 29:34.271
Ran for their lives!

29:35.715 --> 29:37.149
[gunshot]

29:39.520 --> 29:41.269
What the hell is this?

29:41.280 --> 29:42.521
The Dark One will
no longer tolerate

29:42.556 --> 29:45.440
your shifting loyalties.

29:45.451 --> 29:49.611
Look, she invited me to see her,
I shouldn't have said no

29:49.622 --> 29:54.208
but I know things now
that I didn't know then.

29:56.370 --> 29:57.702
Aren't you listening to me?

29:57.737 --> 30:00.672
Take me to see her!

30:02.826 --> 30:04.918
Take the shot.

30:04.995 --> 30:05.803
Easy.

30:05.879 --> 30:08.547
What're you doing?
They could kill her.

30:08.582 --> 30:11.758
She's talked her way
out of worse before.

30:11.835 --> 30:14.311
Let's see what she has
to say.

30:14.388 --> 30:16.313
You think you're
just gonna kill me?

30:16.390 --> 30:18.982
You have no idea
what you're up against.

30:26.600 --> 30:27.899
I have my orders.

30:27.934 --> 30:29.734
[gasps]

30:29.811 --> 30:32.737
From the Oracle.

30:32.772 --> 30:34.322
It's you, isn't it?

30:34.333 --> 30:35.440
I will have your head.

30:35.517 --> 30:38.743
No, no, no, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

30:38.820 --> 30:41.380
You see? Now the fast
talking begins.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.958
Wait. I have something you need.

30:45.035 --> 30:48.011
Something- something that the
Dark One is really gonna want.

30:48.088 --> 30:50.681
Lies. Lies.

30:50.757 --> 30:52.683
You can no longer escape
our master's wrath

30:52.759 --> 30:54.593
with your empty promises.

30:54.628 --> 30:56.928
You fled rather
than answer her call.

30:57.005 --> 30:58.522
No! No!

30:58.599 --> 31:00.599
I- I was on my way when
a bunch of our own kind,

31:00.634 --> 31:01.933
they- they jumped me!

31:01.968 --> 31:03.602
They jumped me, I swear!

31:03.637 --> 31:06.271
Those who have refused
her invitation

31:06.348 --> 31:08.356
have all come
to the same fate.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.576
Alright, that's enough.
Just do it.

31:11.728 --> 31:12.369
Please!

31:12.446 --> 31:13.370
Please don't do this!

31:13.447 --> 31:14.779
It's the humans,
I can- I can-

31:14.814 --> 31:15.947
[cries out]

31:15.982 --> 31:17.949
[gunshot]

31:17.984 --> 31:19.543
[gunshots]

31:32.666 --> 31:34.391
What the hell were you
waiting for?!

31:34.468 --> 31:36.602
The truth for a change.

31:37.420 --> 31:38.687
[gunshots]

31:39.422 --> 31:40.388
[gunshots]

31:40.399 --> 31:41.806
Axel.

31:41.841 --> 31:44.392
You're the humans
she spoke of.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.403
Yeah, ain't life a bitch?

31:46.480 --> 31:49.814
Only a matter of time before
I kill the young Van Helsing.

31:49.849 --> 31:51.074
You cannot defeat us.

31:51.151 --> 31:53.026
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

31:53.103 --> 31:57.739
I will force her to do things
you could barely imagine.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.741
Just like I made your
girlfriend Scarlett

31:59.752 --> 32:03.662
sacrifice herself...
for nothing.

32:03.697 --> 32:04.963
[gunshots]

32:16.292 --> 32:18.218
Then we need each other
more than ever.

32:18.294 --> 32:19.603
You were gonna give us up.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.104
We're nothing to you but decoys.

32:21.181 --> 32:22.030
You got me all wrong.

32:22.032 --> 32:24.107
I was lying to them
to buy time.

32:24.184 --> 32:26.393
I am so done
with your bullshit.

32:26.469 --> 32:28.111
Harm me and you'll never
find out

32:28.188 --> 32:30.605
what I know about
the Dark One.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.774
How can you not see her
for what she really is?

32:32.785 --> 32:34.526
What's this hold
she's got on you?

32:34.561 --> 32:36.453
I make my own decisions, Axel.

32:36.530 --> 32:38.288
-Really?
-Yeah.

32:38.365 --> 32:39.197
Ok, well here's one.

32:39.274 --> 32:40.791
I'm leaving,
she's not.

32:40.867 --> 32:41.833
Choose!

32:44.821 --> 32:46.705
Axel, wait a minute.

32:46.740 --> 32:48.289
<i> Axel!</i>

32:48.300 --> 32:50.709
<i> Axel, hold on!</i>

32:50.785 --> 32:52.386
Just wait a second!

32:57.643 --> 33:00.301
Were you really gonna do that?

33:00.312 --> 33:05.140
Turn me over
like I was nothing?

33:05.150 --> 33:06.224
Come on, baby.

33:06.259 --> 33:08.485
Answer the question.

33:08.562 --> 33:11.229
Never.

33:11.306 --> 33:15.400
I'm telling you the truth.

33:15.477 --> 33:17.569
Then what's this secret you know
about the Dark One?

33:17.604 --> 33:21.489
'Cause if you can't
give me that...

33:21.500 --> 33:24.826
She's gathering the brood
leaders for something.

33:24.837 --> 33:26.545
Something big.

33:30.366 --> 33:31.800
Oh, yeah?

33:36.456 --> 33:39.424
You told me you failed
to build your empire.

33:39.501 --> 33:41.518
This territory?

33:41.595 --> 33:43.520
Axel was right all along.

33:43.597 --> 33:47.566
The vampire you warned us about
is you, isn't it?

33:53.515 --> 33:56.775
Don't you see what's happening?

33:56.810 --> 34:02.322
The Dark One's forces tried to
kill me when I refused to meet.

34:02.398 --> 34:06.326
My brood was slaughtered.

34:06.402 --> 34:09.662
But I escaped...

34:09.739 --> 34:11.631
like I always do.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.886
Because I'm a survivor.

34:18.873 --> 34:21.933
Were you lying then
or are you lying now?

34:26.473 --> 34:27.639
What?

34:27.715 --> 34:29.649
<i> Now, you're better than me?</i>

34:30.718 --> 34:34.854
A human, working
for the Van Helsing?

34:34.931 --> 34:37.649
Trying to kill everything
you once were.

34:37.684 --> 34:42.487
Everything I still am.

34:42.522 --> 34:44.489
You want me dead.

34:44.566 --> 34:45.749
Say it.

34:45.826 --> 34:47.408
No.

34:47.419 --> 34:48.910
I want you back.

34:48.921 --> 34:49.920
Human.

34:52.448 --> 34:54.174
Oh, Julius.

34:56.619 --> 35:01.005
You've forgotten who you were.

35:01.082 --> 35:07.846
Remember how it felt,
you and me?

35:07.922 --> 35:10.565
This world could have
been ours.

35:12.352 --> 35:14.277
It still can be.

35:14.354 --> 35:16.321
It's not too late.

35:18.358 --> 35:22.527
Carpe noctus.

35:22.562 --> 35:24.287
Forever.

35:32.322 --> 35:33.538
No!

35:33.615 --> 35:36.583
[coughing]

35:36.659 --> 35:41.754
What are you... why aren't
you turning?

35:41.831 --> 35:45.433
I can't turn back again,
even if I wanted to.

35:48.388 --> 35:51.389
The curse of the Van Helsing.

35:51.466 --> 35:53.725
No. No, no, hey.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.727
It's a gift.

35:55.803 --> 35:58.655
And she can give it to you, too.

35:58.732 --> 36:00.899
Let me make it up
for letting you go.

36:00.975 --> 36:04.611
I can help you be the woman
you were before all of this.

36:04.687 --> 36:07.906
You don't know anything
about the woman I was!

36:07.941 --> 36:08.907
I saw you.

36:08.942 --> 36:10.742
-No.
-Yeah.

36:10.777 --> 36:12.911
I saw who you were.

36:12.987 --> 36:17.457
Nina, you deserve
a second chance.

36:17.533 --> 36:21.628
A second chance
to seize the day.

36:21.704 --> 36:24.756
This is my second chance.

36:24.791 --> 36:28.018
I was never that girl
in the pictures.

36:28.094 --> 36:32.013
I cheated and lied my way
into the movies.

36:32.024 --> 36:40.104
When people said they'd kill
for roles like those, I did.

36:40.181 --> 36:42.607
I killed to get what I wanted.

36:42.642 --> 36:44.943
I embraced the dark

36:44.978 --> 36:49.781
long before I ever stepped
into the spotlight.

36:49.816 --> 36:55.378
Long before I ever became...
this.

36:59.701 --> 37:08.633
All these years wondering
what could have been for what?

37:08.668 --> 37:11.603
You should have died
that night.

37:13.807 --> 37:15.482
What night?

37:17.051 --> 37:21.062
You knew what I was walking
into that night?

37:21.073 --> 37:24.691
You knew?

37:24.767 --> 37:26.701
You knew?!

37:43.837 --> 37:46.045
We'll head east tonight.

37:46.122 --> 37:50.174
New city, new life.

37:50.251 --> 37:54.178
Just you and me.

37:54.255 --> 38:00.560
I didn't wanna say goodbye
but you left me no choice.

38:00.636 --> 38:02.570
And it's pulling me apart.

38:06.100 --> 38:09.193
You're staying.

38:09.228 --> 38:12.196
For her.

38:12.231 --> 38:14.040
I have to.

38:19.113 --> 38:21.047
Then you're dead to me.

39:00.154 --> 39:00.912
Julius!

39:00.988 --> 39:01.521
Shh!

39:01.598 --> 39:02.672
Where have you been?

39:02.749 --> 39:04.749
-Shhh!
-Don't you shush me!

39:04.784 --> 39:07.552
We have to go, now!

39:10.998 --> 39:12.891
A Van Helsing.

39:14.836 --> 39:16.853
[glass shatters]

39:35.782 --> 39:38.282
That Nina, she blinded you.

39:38.317 --> 39:39.992
This is my fault.

39:40.069 --> 39:41.786
I should have listened to you.

39:41.821 --> 39:44.205
No, I knew you'd come back.

39:44.216 --> 39:46.958
Nobody loves a boy
like his mama.

39:47.034 --> 39:48.292
[gate opens]

39:48.327 --> 39:50.470
We need to go now!

40:20.943 --> 40:23.378
I know you have it.

40:27.450 --> 40:29.208
Have what?

40:29.285 --> 40:33.045
You're smart enough to have
figured out what that compass is

40:33.122 --> 40:36.007
and where it leads.

40:36.042 --> 40:38.977
I'm not gonna ask twice.

40:46.761 --> 40:51.355
I'm gonna bring this to her
to bargain for Julius's life.

40:51.432 --> 40:55.902
With all of her power
maybe she can change him back.

40:55.978 --> 41:01.115
And then we can be together
like it was meant to be.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.960
You want him to be happy,
don't you?

41:09.408 --> 41:12.084
All you care about is
saving your own skin.

41:12.161 --> 41:16.881
Julius can't see that,
but you ain't fooling me.

41:16.916 --> 41:20.051
By the way, you are
a shitty actress.

41:20.086 --> 41:21.552
[laughs]

41:24.632 --> 41:28.392
You remind me of a co-star
I once had.

41:28.469 --> 41:32.563
Always liked to play
brave soldiers.

41:32.640 --> 41:36.284
Always liked to get handsy
off camera.

41:40.022 --> 41:43.074
You never forget
your first kill.

41:43.109 --> 41:44.375
[laughs]

41:47.506 --> 41:49.297
Last chance.

41:53.369 --> 41:55.386
I never back down.

42:02.295 --> 42:04.229
I figured.
