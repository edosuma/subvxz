00:02.000 --> 00:05.040
This programme contains some strong
language and some violent scenes.

00:05.040 --> 00:07.640
I understand you have this drive
to get to the very heart of things.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.240
It's commendable.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.440
Eyewitnesses?

00:10.440 --> 00:12.120
No eyewitnesses,
no sign of the victim.

00:12.120 --> 00:14.520
Shaun Emery, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of assault,

00:14.520 --> 00:17.440
kidnapping, and perverting
the course of justice.  What?

00:17.440 --> 00:19.160
Do we know who the victim is?

00:19.160 --> 00:21.440
Hannah Roberts,
human rights specialist.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.760
MoD war crimes, terrorism.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.920
That ain't right.
She got on that bus.

00:27.920 --> 00:31.320
Shaun Emery claims this evidence
is somehow untrue.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.280
This ain't what happened!
None of this happened!

00:33.280 --> 00:36.840
But here at counter-terrorism,
accepting you can rarely see

00:36.840 --> 00:40.200
the whole picture
is part of the job.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.320
Target approaching.
48 Eaton Square.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.000
We're in position, and we do not
have eyes on Shaun Emery.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.200
I can see him.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.640
I think someone's interfering
with our feeds.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.520
Tampering with evidence.

00:54.840 --> 00:59.120
They call it correction when they
take something they don't like

00:59.120 --> 01:02.280
and they change it.

01:02.280 --> 01:05.160
100% photo-real manipulation.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.920
You wouldn't believe your eyes.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.400
They're setting him up,
you know that.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.320
This is the first time I've been
given a role in an op like this.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.960
I never had your fast-track
privileges.

01:14.960 --> 01:17.760
Ma'am, I don't trust these people
one bit,

01:17.760 --> 01:19.920
but Shaun Emery's video
can't be fake.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.480
We've got the body.

01:25.320 --> 01:28.720
Correction turns intelligence
into evidence,

01:28.720 --> 01:31.520
and keeps extremists
off the street.

01:32.800 --> 01:36.160
If Shaun didn't kill Hannah Roberts,
then who did?

01:38.520 --> 01:40.280
Ma'am, she's there.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.000
Hannah Roberts.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.520
The CCTV was doctored,
but not the footage from the bus.

01:45.520 --> 01:48.240
If you knew what was at stake,
you would walk away

01:48.240 --> 01:50.840
and pretend this never happened.

01:50.840 --> 01:55.040
Can you imagine the impact
if correction was fully exposed?

01:55.040 --> 01:57.120
If you hadn't corrupted the file.

01:57.120 --> 01:59.640
I'm sure you make copies.

01:59.640 --> 02:03.040
I can't think of a better way
to turn this problem

02:03.040 --> 02:05.120
into an opportunity.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.800
For what?  Her recruitment.

02:07.800 --> 02:11.040
If you join us, you'll learn
how to use correction

02:11.040 --> 02:12.720
as a force for good.

02:13.920 --> 02:16.160
What if I don't?

02:16.160 --> 02:19.560
Do I end up in the boot of a car,
like Hannah Roberts?

02:19.560 --> 02:22.080
You're a Detective Inspector.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.080
Bright girl.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.680
Too bright?

02:31.040 --> 02:33.040
When can I start?

03:26.640 --> 03:28.480
VEHICLE DOOR SLAMS

03:31.360 --> 03:32.840

04:43.280 --> 04:45.440
SOFT FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

04:48.000 --> 04:51.960
RINGING TONE

05:01.960 --> 05:04.080
FOOTSTEPS NEARBY

FOOTSTEPS RETREAT

07:00.360 --> 07:01.920
Ah!  Nice, nice.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.800
THEY GRUNT

07:06.800 --> 07:07.960
Break.

07:09.240 --> 07:11.480
Right. So, when he's about
to attack, don't wait.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.560
Go in, move first,
you strike and take control.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.480
All right, let's see it. Go.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.320
HE GROANS

07:22.800 --> 07:25.280
Break!

07:22.800 --> 07:25.280
ONLOOKERS GROAN

07:25.280 --> 07:27.000
All right, easy.  Whoa...

07:27.000 --> 07:29.200
Stomach, groin, top of the foot.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.200
We go through the points
of vulnerability every week,

07:32.200 --> 07:35.560
points that can be exploited
to immobilise your opponent.

07:35.560 --> 07:38.120
But a straight to the windpipe,

07:38.120 --> 07:40.960
that's not self-defence.
That's manslaughter.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.360
You only need that kind of move if
you believe your life is in danger.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.440
SHE SIGHS

08:29.400 --> 08:31.240
DOOR SHUTS

08:59.000 --> 09:02.600
NEWSREADER:  The Government's hotly
anticipated verdict on Xanda's bid

09:02.600 --> 09:05.480
rests on the findings of
the China Research Committee.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.200
But just how impartial is the CRC?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.280
WATER FLOWS

09:38.600 --> 09:41.400
STEADY BEEPING

09:48.480 --> 09:51.360
I was thinking you could say,
"A handful of backbenchers

09:51.360 --> 09:55.160
"isn't enough to cause a rift. It's
barely enough to cause a ripple."

09:55.160 --> 09:56.720
HE SCOFFS

09:56.720 --> 09:59.360
I think that that works if you leave
a gap, like you're reaching for it.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.040
What, like it's not prepared?
Exactly.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.040
PHONE PINGS

10:02.040 --> 10:04.040
Oh, here's Eliza.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.040
Better cover up,
or there'll be a tribunal.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.520
HE LAUGHS

10:07.520 --> 10:10.080
Isaac, you've got five minutes.
Yeah.  He knows.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.760
Have they tested the connection?
Yep, same connection as last time.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.440
TV NEWS PLAYS

10:14.440 --> 10:15.960
Daddy.  Yeah?

10:15.960 --> 10:19.080
What are five ways
we use electricity?

10:19.080 --> 10:20.600
Er, electric cars?

10:20.600 --> 10:22.520
In the home.  Hi, Simone.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.800
Oh, hi. Morning, Eliza.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.600
You could have a computer.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.600
Daddy has to go on his computer.

10:28.600 --> 10:31.200
Or TV. Daddy's going to be on TV...!

10:31.200 --> 10:32.920
Anything not directly about you?

10:32.920 --> 10:34.560
Coffee machine.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.080
TV:  Security Minister Isaac Turner
is joining us live from

10:37.080 --> 10:39.720
his constituency in Haslemere South.
But before he does...

10:39.720 --> 10:42.760
BBC Breakfast, four minutes.
Oh, I'll be watching...

10:42.760 --> 10:44.680
..Sky.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.680
ISAAC LAUGHS

10:44.680 --> 10:47.200
We haven't talked about China yet.
I need two more, Daddy.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.000
Erm...
Which tie are you wearing?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.200
Probably the one around my neck.
What's wrong with the tie?

10:51.200 --> 10:52.640
Stripes. Not exactly MOTP.

10:52.640 --> 10:54.480
There's nothing wrong with the tie.
I know.

10:54.480 --> 10:55.880
MOTP?  Man of the people.

10:55.880 --> 10:58.360
This was actually a present
from my very beautiful wife.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.200
It's quicker to say
"man of the people."  Daddy.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.680
Look, can we talk about China,
please?  I need two more, Daddy.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.640
Ph-Phones? Simone!

11:06.640 --> 11:09.000
One more!  All right, Harry.
Back to Mummy, OK?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.800
Back to Mummy.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.640
NEWSREADER:  It's the controversial
question dividing Westminster -

11:13.640 --> 11:18.000
could Chinese AI technology
be coming to an airport...

11:18.000 --> 11:21.920
And I can't say anything about China
until I've seen the Xanda pitch.

11:21.920 --> 11:24.520
Agree. Whatever they ask,
keep it safe, neutral.

11:24.520 --> 11:28.000
Probably best to go crucifix in.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.040
Oh. Rhys, is my faith a problem?

11:30.040 --> 11:32.000
I mean, I could renounce
God altogether,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.120
if you think it might poll better?
No, no need.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.640
It's 7:40. They're waiting for you.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.680
Yeah, I just need a moment to pray.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.920
Right.  OK.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.400
I'm kidding, for fuck's sake.
Off you go.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.600
NEWSREADER:  But can the Chinese
technology giant be trusted

11:45.600 --> 11:48.640
to run state of the art surveillance
at Britain's borders?

11:48.640 --> 11:51.720
Who better to ask than the man
in charge of the Government's

11:51.720 --> 11:56.120
hotly anticipated China research
report, Isaac Turner?

11:56.120 --> 11:57.960
Minister, good morning.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.120
Yes, good morning, Will.
Good morning, Lauren.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.920
Minister, as the man who called
for unity, how does it feel to be

12:02.920 --> 12:04.920
at the centre of a growing rift?

12:04.920 --> 12:07.920
Er, I assume, Lauren, you mean
the debate surrounding

12:07.920 --> 12:10.000
facial recognition.
It's hardly a rift.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
30 MPs have accused the China
Research Committee of being

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
loaded with China sceptics.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.640
Well, as Security Minister,
it's my job to evaluate the risks

12:18.640 --> 12:22.080
of using Chinese-owned technology
in UK border security.

12:22.080 --> 12:26.840
And I can assure you, our
forthcoming report on-on, er...

12:26.840 --> 12:31.400
..the facial recognition,
er, contract

12:31.400 --> 12:36.760
will-will be, er, solely
in-informed by, er...

12:36.760 --> 12:40.280
..unbiased, er, expert...

12:40.280 --> 12:42.440
Solely informed by, er...

12:42.440 --> 12:44.080
NEWS PRESENTERS LAUGH

12:44.080 --> 12:45.400
Shit...!

12:45.400 --> 12:47.040
I-I'm so sorry.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.560
I'm being distracted by a very
persistent six-year-old.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.960
Hello, young man.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.200
Oh, my God.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.800
I take it he's not a member
of the CRC?

12:53.800 --> 12:57.040
No. Not unless it stands
for cheeky, rude something.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.320
Oh, my God.  Morning, Harrison.

12:59.320 --> 13:03.160
What's your opinion on the
regulation of Chinese technology?

13:03.160 --> 13:05.800
Can they see me?
A lot of people can see you.

13:05.800 --> 13:09.600
And, brilliantly, you've avoided
answering the question!

13:09.600 --> 13:11.240
A true politician in the making.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.400
No. In fairness, I think Harrison
just wants some help

13:13.400 --> 13:15.240
with his homework.  Aw, adorable.

13:15.240 --> 13:21.000
You're looking for one more thing
in the home that uses electricity.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
What about a...?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.160
Camera.  Camera!

13:25.160 --> 13:28.160
Well, it seems you have your hands
full here, Minister.

13:28.160 --> 13:31.200
No government matter takes
priority over homework.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.800
I think that's a value we all share.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.000
Ma'am. Morning.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.320
I'm, er... I'm glad I caught you.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.080
You know this is odd?

14:07.080 --> 14:09.480
I do.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.120
You are still in mapping?

14:11.120 --> 14:13.680
Yes. That's what I wanted
to speak to you about...

14:13.680 --> 14:15.640
Mapping is on six.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.520
I'm aware.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.520
ELEVATOR DINGS

14:17.520 --> 14:18.680
AUTOMATED:  Seventh floor.

14:18.680 --> 14:20.640
I wondered if we could schedule
a time to discuss...

14:20.640 --> 14:22.520
Excuse me. I'm due at a brief.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.480
You'll find your way around
eventually, Detective.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.120
KEYPAD ENTRY BEEPS

14:42.320 --> 14:43.760
Morning, Nads.

14:43.760 --> 14:46.560
Oat milk cortado, just how
you like it.  Seriously?

14:46.560 --> 14:49.080
No. It's petrol station mud,
but it's still warm.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.000
Victim ID?

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
A Mr Edison Yao.
Chinese national, apparently.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.680
Cleaner found him this morning.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.480
There's a language barrier,
but we've called for a translator.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.560
Eyewitnesses?  Got uniform on
every door, asking the question.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.360
CCTV?

15:03.360 --> 15:05.960
We're pulling all footage from
the building, inside and out.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.480
Shall we?

15:08.840 --> 15:10.120
Ma'am.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.000
Can't do "ma'am" AND get the coffee.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.440
I thought he was right next to me.

15:17.440 --> 15:20.160
I was too busy watching. Oh, wait.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.840
It's Mum. I'll call you back.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.920
Did you see it?
I think everyone saw it.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.720
You're famous, Harrison.
I'm not famous.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.640
You're going to be on TV.
Here you go, darling.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.360
I'll call you later. I've got to go.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.640
Harry, that was very sweet.

15:31.640 --> 15:35.000
But you know you're not allowed in
Daddy's office when he's working.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.440
We won't be able to interrupt Daddy
when he's Prime Minister

15:37.440 --> 15:39.080
talking about important things.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.800
I think I WAS talking about
important things.  You were.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.800
You were very good,
especially with him.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.600
Maybe I should make a fool
of myself more often.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.520
Can you not?

15:53.440 --> 15:54.880
Hey...

15:56.240 --> 15:57.640
CAMERA CLICKS

15:58.800 --> 16:01.920
Is that paps?
Does anyone really care?

16:06.680 --> 16:08.400
CAMERA CLICKS

16:13.920 --> 16:15.640
HORN TOOTS

16:19.120 --> 16:20.640
ENGINE TURNS OVER

16:27.200 --> 16:28.840
CAMERA CLICKS

16:29.920 --> 16:32.840
Single gunshot fatality.
Victim took one round to the eye,

16:32.840 --> 16:36.120
along with a shower of glass
splinters to the face.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.240
To the eye?  The position of the body
and location of the entry wound

16:39.240 --> 16:42.360
suggests the victim was standing by
the door at the time of impact.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.120
He was looking through the peephole.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.280
It's the calibre of the round
that interests me.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.800
Go on.  5.8mm.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.040
A lot smaller than the typical 9mm
and pretty rare in the UK.

16:52.040 --> 16:56.200
In terms of weapon, you could be
looking at a Type 92 QSZ automatic,

16:56.200 --> 16:59.440
but you don't normally find those
outside mainland China.

17:02.400 --> 17:05.760
Coroner's first look puts time
of death just after 7pm.

17:05.760 --> 17:09.440
What else do we know about Mr Yao?
Morning.  Morning, ma'am.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.400
Here we go. Hopefully a lot more,
now she's here.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.400
Good morning. DI Latif?

17:14.400 --> 17:16.840
Yeah, I'm DS Flynn.
This way for the witness.

17:16.840 --> 17:19.400
Obviously, she's had a bit of a
shock, but we need the poor woman

17:19.400 --> 17:21.880
to throw some light on the murder
victim, and pronto.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.360
Er... OK.

17:25.360 --> 17:27.440
Hi.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.880
This is targeted. Assassination.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.800
Maybe political or state actors.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.720
What, you want to kick it up?

17:34.720 --> 17:36.440
I'll call SO15.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.040
Erm... Sorry.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.040
This lady doesn't seem to
speak English.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.600
Yeah.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.240
Well, I don't speak Cantonese.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.880
Well, what do you speak?

17:46.880 --> 17:48.240
English.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.560
A few words of Mandarin
from my grandmother.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.120
What kind of translator are you?

17:52.120 --> 17:54.760
Apologies. I got stuck at Selhurst.

17:54.760 --> 17:57.640
Come again?  I was told you needed
a Cantonese speaker.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.480
At your service.

17:59.480 --> 18:02.200
So, who are you?
DC Tan, ma'am.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.200
I'm supposed to start
with you today.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.800
Oh, shit...

18:05.800 --> 18:07.800
Sorry, I just, erm...

18:07.800 --> 18:10.400
Ma'am?  What is it?

18:10.400 --> 18:12.800
Got the resident's security system
up and running.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.600
It's quite the system.
Bloody hell.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.920
I've heard of home surveillance,

18:18.920 --> 18:21.800
but why monitor feeds
outside the property?

18:22.960 --> 18:25.400
He knew he needed to watch out.

18:35.600 --> 18:39.360
REPORTERS CLAMOUR

18:40.960 --> 18:43.640
Mr Turner, does the name
Victoria Bello mean anything to you?

18:43.640 --> 18:45.600
Victoria Bello from Lagos.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.560
Stay back, please.
Can you stay back?

18:48.920 --> 18:51.320
#HarrisonsHomework trending
number two in the UK.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.520
Who's number one?  Taylor Swift.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.360
I think I can live with that.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.680
Can I suggest we, er, carpe diem?

18:57.680 --> 18:59.280
Seize the day.

18:59.280 --> 19:00.640
I know what it means.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.800
How?  Deliver the facial
rec report early,

19:02.800 --> 19:04.320
bring forward the announcement.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.360
We'll need to assemble the experts
for a final vote.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.720
Yeah, so do it. Gather the geeks.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.480
Look, let's not imply
I'm ready to vote

19:10.480 --> 19:12.000
before I've even seen the pitch.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.440
So, directly afterwards?  Yep.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.640
Hey.  Nice to meet you.
How do you do?

19:16.640 --> 19:18.880
Hi, nice to meet you.
How are you?

19:18.880 --> 19:22.160
SHE SPEAKS CANTONESE

19:24.000 --> 19:26.880
Er, he was from Hong Kong.
He had no family in London.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.040
She says he never spoke
about himself,

19:29.040 --> 19:31.160
but she knows he was a scientist.

19:31.160 --> 19:34.640
THEY SPEAK CANTONESE

19:36.520 --> 19:38.160
Computer, she thinks.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.360
She says he was a very
private man, quiet.

19:40.360 --> 19:41.760
Sorry to interrupt.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.440
I found the recordings.

19:45.400 --> 19:48.480
CLEANER CONTINUES TALKING

19:54.000 --> 19:56.280
Doesn't look too happy.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.080
What's he saying?

20:06.080 --> 20:08.040
That's what I'd like to know.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.840
Does Mrs Li have to watch this?

20:23.400 --> 20:25.280
MRS LI GASPS

20:27.080 --> 20:29.320
That's not the weirdest part.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.760
There's no-one there.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.720
MRS LI SPEAKS CANTONESE

20:46.840 --> 20:48.600
What did she say?

20:48.600 --> 20:51.840
Gwai? As in gwai lo?

20:51.840 --> 20:54.000
Even I know that one - white man.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.040
You saw a white man?
No, no, no.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.640
In this context,
gwai doesn't mean white man.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.440
SHE SPEAKS CANTONESE

21:06.760 --> 21:08.520
She says it's a ghost.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.200
Archive all the recordings.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.800
Call SO15.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.040
Expand the CCTV trawl
to a three-mile radius.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.960
Get me a profile on the victim.

21:18.960 --> 21:22.120
And a signed witness statement
from the Woman In Black.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.360
Nads...

21:27.360 --> 21:28.560
Ma'am.

21:28.560 --> 21:31.080
Someone's obviously fucking
with the footage.

21:31.080 --> 21:33.280
You know exactly who we need
to call,

21:33.280 --> 21:35.360
and it ain't Ghostbusters.

21:40.040 --> 21:44.720
November X-ray 7118 is down
on the A111.

21:44.720 --> 21:50.040
Ditto Zulu Mike 9229 on the A105.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.680
Blindspots?

21:51.680 --> 21:57.280
India Golf 3137 has left us with a
0.17km compromise on the City Road.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.800
It's a council unit,
so we can expect repair any time

22:00.800 --> 22:03.480
between now and 2076.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.480
CHUCKLING AROUND ROOM

22:03.480 --> 22:04.880
Send an engineer to repair...

22:04.880 --> 22:08.040
We've sent an engineer to repair
the unit.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.720
Anything else from the handover?

22:09.720 --> 22:13.000
A lamp went out overnight
on the B116.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Looks good, yeah.
Saving one of those...

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
Er... Er, a lamp?  Correct.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.560
Generate a 24 hour...

22:19.560 --> 22:22.440
We've generated a 24 hour
beta feed as standard.

22:22.440 --> 22:23.680
Good-oh.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.480
I'd like to know when
they'll be replacing...

22:25.480 --> 22:27.440
PHONE BUZZES

22:28.960 --> 22:30.640
DCI Carey.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.560
Xanda Facial Recognition.

22:37.560 --> 22:41.240
The only security system in
the world to identify a human face

22:41.240 --> 22:44.200
with up to 100% accuracy.

22:44.200 --> 22:47.840
Integrating surveillance technology
with artificial intelligence,

22:47.840 --> 22:53.120
Xanda generates 3D modelling for
every individual captured on CCTV,

22:53.120 --> 22:56.440
even if the individual in question
is wearing a face mask.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.760
Xanda's thermal cam measures body
temperature to flag suspicious

23:00.760 --> 23:05.040
behaviour, or to indicate if
a passenger is carrying a virus.

23:05.040 --> 23:07.840
Providing digital surveillance
for airports and urban areas

23:07.840 --> 23:11.360
across the world, Xanda's database
is rich in diversity,

23:11.360 --> 23:13.840
and its AI is ever evolving.

23:15.640 --> 23:19.640
Xanda is committed to recognising
faces from every corner

23:19.640 --> 23:22.040
of the globe with equal precision.

23:24.720 --> 23:28.400
I've called the CRC vote for 3:30.
The Home Sec can meet after 7:00.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.680
So glad you could attend our
presentation, Mr Turner.

23:31.680 --> 23:34.120
Oh, Mr Wanglei,
that was very impressive.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.880
The Xanda executive board
doesn't fly across the world

23:36.880 --> 23:38.360
for every pitch.

23:38.360 --> 23:40.840
I'm curious to hear more
on the racial bias issue.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.640
We don't have a racial bias issue.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.200
Are we allowed to see your data?

23:45.200 --> 23:47.640
Some facial rec systems
are ten times more likely

23:47.640 --> 23:50.480
to falsely ID a black female face
than a white male one.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.200
So, you see our concern.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.720
Xanda's AI is not susceptible
to those failings.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.080
Yet you won't allow the programme
to be independently tested.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.560
HE LAUGHS AWKWARDLY

24:00.560 --> 24:03.440
Mr Turner, I was led to believe
that your China Research Committee

24:03.440 --> 24:05.200
was made up of experts.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.720
Oh, Rhys and Eliza are not
part of the committee,

24:07.720 --> 24:09.760
as I'm sure you're aware.  Oh.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.920
So, where...
are these elusive experts?

24:12.920 --> 24:14.840
Might we ever meet them?

24:14.840 --> 24:17.680
We have a duty to protect
their identities.

24:17.680 --> 24:20.320
Leaving us pitching
to an empty room.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.880
It's not empty.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.600
I'm here.

24:26.800 --> 24:31.960
Sometimes it seems to me as if
there are...two Isaac Turners.

24:33.480 --> 24:36.120
On television, you say
you have an open mind,

24:36.120 --> 24:40.320
but in reality, I get the sense
your decision has long been made.

24:40.320 --> 24:44.360
So, which Isaac Turner
should I believe?

24:47.760 --> 24:50.080
I have to assume there's a chance,
Mr Wanglei,

24:50.080 --> 24:51.800
that you're recording this.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.560
So, for the benefit of whatever
listening device you may

24:54.560 --> 24:57.200
have running, what I'm about
to say is my own opinion,

24:57.200 --> 24:58.800
off the record,

24:58.800 --> 25:02.320
and doesn't reflect the views
of the British government.

25:02.320 --> 25:05.320
I don't need a presentation to know
you're the world leaders.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.160
Nobody spies like China.

25:07.160 --> 25:10.200
And perhaps you're confusing us
with the Chinese authorities.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.040
ISAAC LAUGHS DRYLY

25:12.040 --> 25:14.640
You're one and the same.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.120
Don't worry, I don't blame you.
It's not like you have a choice.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.760
What is it?

25:18.760 --> 25:23.520
"The private sector must collaborate
with national intelligence."

25:23.520 --> 25:25.360
It's Chinese law.

25:25.360 --> 25:29.800
So, when Beijing calls and asks you
to look the other way while

25:29.800 --> 25:33.240
their spies slip through airport
security, or orders you to

25:33.240 --> 25:37.240
facially recognise China's political
enemies on British turf...

25:37.240 --> 25:39.280
..what are you going to say?

25:39.280 --> 25:40.680
No?

25:40.680 --> 25:44.520
The use of Chinese AI technology
poses no threat to your safety,

25:44.520 --> 25:47.520
your security, or your way of life.

25:47.520 --> 25:49.200
Yeah, I read the propaganda.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.760
Sorry, press release.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.360
There may even be ministers in
my government naive enough

25:53.360 --> 25:56.560
to believe it. Unfortunately for
you, without my recommendation,

25:56.560 --> 25:59.520
your bid will never reach them.

25:59.520 --> 26:02.480
As long as I'm Security Minister,

26:02.480 --> 26:04.840
Britain's borders won't be
monitored by a storefront

26:04.840 --> 26:07.080
for the People's Republic of China.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.400
It seems we've wasted our time.

26:20.200 --> 26:24.000
If we're as good at spying
as you say we are...

26:24.000 --> 26:26.880
..you might be a little
more careful.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.800
I've got nothing to hide.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.760
Everybody has something.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.760
Erm... DC Tan?

26:49.760 --> 26:51.000
Chloe.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.120
Yeah, I'm...

26:53.120 --> 26:56.400
Sorry about earlier. They said the
translator was on HER way, so I...

26:56.400 --> 26:58.320
I was the Chinese translator.

26:58.320 --> 27:01.520
Is that terrible?
That's terrible, isn't it?

27:01.520 --> 27:03.680
I'm not going to report you.

27:03.680 --> 27:05.000
The doughnuts are on me.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.800
So, now you're buying my silence?

27:06.800 --> 27:08.160
What?

27:16.960 --> 27:19.000
Nadia.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.760
Congrats on the step up.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.240
Likewise.

27:23.680 --> 27:26.080
How's the inner sanctum?

27:26.080 --> 27:27.800
Busy.  Hmm.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.760
So, who's your victim?

27:31.760 --> 27:35.200
Chinese national.
Assassinated in his apartment.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.200
You'll need access
to the Chinese embassy,

27:37.200 --> 27:38.960
SIO support to brief the service.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.200
Was he a dissident?

27:40.200 --> 27:43.160
I-I'm not asking you how to
run the case, Rachel.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.840
There's something else.

27:44.840 --> 27:47.320
He had CCTV all over the flat,
inside and out.

27:47.320 --> 27:49.560
Only, the shooters are nowhere
to be seen.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.840
Someone's doctored the CCTV.

27:51.840 --> 27:54.120
That, or we're looking
for a poltergeist.

27:54.120 --> 27:55.840
That's why you called me.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.760
I thought you might have
some...insight.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.320
Why would I?

28:00.320 --> 28:01.560
Oh, I see.

28:01.560 --> 28:04.760
Do we need a sacred code,
or something? Special handshake?

28:04.760 --> 28:06.960
If you want me to take a look
at the footage, send me the...

28:06.960 --> 28:09.760
No way. It's on our turf,
and not SO.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.120
Oh, what, you expect our trust?

28:13.120 --> 28:15.760
You know what, let's just leave it,
Patrick. We've got enough going on.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.160
Remind me. How long did
Shaun Emery get in the end?

28:18.160 --> 28:19.640
Four, wasn't it?

28:20.760 --> 28:22.080
Six.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.600
Six years for an innocent bloke.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.640
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.280
No, I get it.

28:31.280 --> 28:33.280
Can't beat them, join them, right?

28:38.280 --> 28:41.040
Good afternoon,
distinguished members

28:41.040 --> 28:43.600
of the China Research Committee.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.000
And Gregory.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.000
LAUGHTER AROUND ROOM

28:46.000 --> 28:48.240
I need to deliver this report
ahead of schedule,

28:48.240 --> 28:50.720
so the question is,
how soon can that happen?

28:50.720 --> 28:53.440
I really hope the answer is,
"Today, Isaac."

28:53.440 --> 28:55.080
Today, Isaac.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.600
Hey, one always wants
more time, right?

28:58.600 --> 29:01.800
But thanks to everybody's
invaluable contributions,

29:01.800 --> 29:04.240
and with some last-minute polishing,

29:04.240 --> 29:06.680
I'm confident we can publish today.

29:06.680 --> 29:09.040
Unless anyone has
any dazzling objections?

29:09.040 --> 29:10.360
Er...

29:10.360 --> 29:13.000
Not everybody is present
for the final vote.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.720
Where is Edison?

29:16.240 --> 29:19.840
Right, well, I think
we go ahead, regardless.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.320
It's not like we don't know
his position on China.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.560
LAUGHTER AROUND ROOM

29:24.560 --> 29:26.400
Sorry to disturb, Minister.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.520
You need to check your inbox.

29:29.640 --> 29:33.040
VIDEO:  Like thousands of visa
applicants, Victoria Bello dreams

29:33.040 --> 29:36.920
of living and working in the UK,
but hers is no ordinary application.

29:36.920 --> 29:40.880
The Lagos-based care worker claims
her three-year-old son's father

29:40.880 --> 29:43.440
is Britain's Security Minister,
Isaac Turner.

29:43.440 --> 29:46.480
Who is this?  News Freak.
Just some fringe site.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.520
Makes Buzzfeed look like
The Washington Post.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.000
Sue the living shit out of them.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.120
It's not online. They've just
sent it to us for comment.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.480
OK. Er, here's my comment -

29:53.480 --> 29:55.720
if you publish, we'll sue
the living shit out of you.

29:55.720 --> 29:58.000
OK. So, the Minister
strenuously denies...

29:58.000 --> 29:59.480
No, it's not worthy of denial.

29:59.480 --> 30:02.120
We don't comment on personal
matters.  Wait, this...

30:02.120 --> 30:04.800
This is them, this is Xanda.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.440
Find out who owns this site.

30:06.440 --> 30:10.200
Guaranteed, they'll be based in
California, funded by Beijing.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.840
OK.  Come on, Eliza.
Where are we going?

30:12.840 --> 30:15.000
To show Wanglei we're not afraid.

30:16.920 --> 30:18.240
Er...

30:32.960 --> 30:35.360
Nice work.

30:35.360 --> 30:36.800
Mr Turner.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.680
I'm on rather a tight schedule.

30:38.680 --> 30:40.760
You got more people to defame?  Oh.

30:40.760 --> 30:43.360
In light of our previous
conversation, my colleagues

30:43.360 --> 30:45.600
have decided to return to Beijing.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.880
I must escort them to the airport.

30:47.880 --> 30:51.400
What-what is this,
intimidation, or...?

30:51.400 --> 30:54.120
Oh, you don't know what
I'm talking about?

31:01.720 --> 31:03.960
HE SPEAKS MANDARIN

31:03.960 --> 31:06.200
THEY LAUGH

31:06.200 --> 31:08.120
You can fake as much news
as you want,

31:08.120 --> 31:10.840
but if you think you can meddle
in UK government policy,

31:10.840 --> 31:13.160
you're sorely mistaken.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.520
If we wanted to meddle, Mr Turner,

31:18.520 --> 31:21.240
do you think this is the best
we can do?

31:25.360 --> 31:27.160
Excuse me.

31:45.920 --> 31:48.160
Ma'am.
I tried to call, and email.

31:48.160 --> 31:51.080
I'll start to think you're
stalking me.  I've got something.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.600
It's with homicide,
a targeted killing.

31:53.600 --> 31:56.920
The CCTV threw up some...concerns.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.920
Our kind of concerns.

31:58.920 --> 32:01.120
I don't know if it crosses
any of our ops, but...

32:01.120 --> 32:03.960
Pass on the details.
I'll assign someone to take a look.

32:03.960 --> 32:06.520
Ma'am, I was hoping
I could take a look.

32:06.520 --> 32:08.520
You'd need clearance
for the seventh floor.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.280
I realise that. This is what I...

32:10.280 --> 32:12.600
Besides, you're in mapping.
Who'd run mapping?

32:14.600 --> 32:16.320
Mapping runs itself.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.960
Don't be modest.

32:18.960 --> 32:21.200
The department needs someone
with your diligence.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.280
It's a badge of honour, you know.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.400
Edison Yao returns home at 6:55pm.

32:29.400 --> 32:32.200
The next event isn't until
33 minutes later,

32:32.200 --> 32:35.040
when a delivery driver enters
the building at 7:28pm.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.040
28 minutes after the attack.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.600
We've trawled every angle.
No-one enters the building

32:39.600 --> 32:42.480
between the victim's arrival
and time of attack.

32:42.480 --> 32:44.440
Expand the timeframe.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.920
Keep looking.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.800
If the shooters can scrub themselves
out on Edison Yao's camera,

32:52.800 --> 32:54.840
they can hack street CCTV.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.720
We can't keep this from SO15
any longer.

32:58.720 --> 33:01.600
You're going to have to swallow
your pride and give them primacy.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.920
Pride?

33:02.920 --> 33:06.320
As soon as they get their claws into
this, it'll be their case, not ours.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.760
And if we can't trust Rachel Carey,
then who?

33:08.760 --> 33:10.960
Your other friend, the spook?

33:13.160 --> 33:14.800
Not going to let me forget it,
are you?

33:14.800 --> 33:17.080
What, turning a blind eye
to evidence tampering,

33:17.080 --> 33:19.040
and then taking a promotion?

33:19.040 --> 33:21.920
Victim profile, ma'am.

33:21.920 --> 33:25.360
His records only go back as far
as 2017, when he entered the UK.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.120
Before that, it's a blank.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.160
I'm guessing Edison Yao
is a new identity.

33:29.160 --> 33:30.760
He may have been a...

33:30.760 --> 33:33.960
Chinese dissident. Yes, I know.

33:33.960 --> 33:38.400
Phone downloads says last activity
was an attempted call at 6:59pm.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.480
Bang on the time of attack.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.280
Maybe he was trying to warn someone.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.760
Caller ID?

33:43.760 --> 33:45.640
Saved on the phone as "Knox".
It's ringing out.

33:45.640 --> 33:48.600
Gregory Knox.
He's some kind of data analyst.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.320
Office in EC1.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.520
I'm on it.

34:07.440 --> 34:10.360
HE PANTS

34:27.560 --> 34:29.720
She's got me in mapping.

34:30.840 --> 34:33.880
I've been promoted to DCI. She's got
me on a fucking light bulb duty.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.720
It's a crucial part of the process.

34:35.720 --> 34:38.160
If seventh floor don't have an
up-to-date comprehensive picture

34:38.160 --> 34:40.440
of the CCTV map,
they can't do their jobs.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.840
But Garland's keeping me there
because she doesn't trust me.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.720
Still.

34:44.720 --> 34:47.520
Not trusting people is sort of
their stock in trade.

34:47.520 --> 34:50.560
Look, I signed up to be
part of this.

34:50.560 --> 34:55.120
To run ops using correction.
To work with the best of the best.

34:55.120 --> 34:57.560
I haven't even got clearance to
the programme I'm supposed to be

34:57.560 --> 34:59.760
working on. It's not right.

35:02.840 --> 35:06.440
Look, Rachel, we should move...
Sorry, I just...

35:06.440 --> 35:08.480
Who else can I speak to?

35:14.600 --> 35:16.200
How are you sleeping?

35:18.080 --> 35:20.680
No worse than usual. Why?

35:20.680 --> 35:22.960
well...

35:22.960 --> 35:25.760
You know what they say in Russia...

35:25.760 --> 35:28.000
..the less you know,
the better you sleep.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.720
You must be up all night.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.080
I'm looking for Gregory Knox.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.800
Which company?

35:57.800 --> 35:59.600
Homicide and serious crime.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.920
I meant, which company is he from?

36:01.920 --> 36:03.720
Er, Truro Analytics.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.720
Truro's on the tenth,
but I think they all left.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.200
Can you give him a call?

36:07.200 --> 36:09.000
I need to hand over. Sorry.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.680
Er, he hasn't swiped out,
so he's still in the building.

36:12.680 --> 36:15.520
Tenth floor, you say?
Yeah, but you need a pass.

36:15.520 --> 36:17.440
What, for an urgent police matter?

36:17.440 --> 36:20.920
Yeah. I'd ask my managers,
but they've all gone home.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.840
Yeah, don't worry yourself.

36:25.840 --> 36:28.360
Time's gone by a police badge
would've got you somewhere.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.400
You're conducting an investigation?

36:30.400 --> 36:32.160
Just trying to find a bloke.

36:32.160 --> 36:34.840
Gregory Knox, Truro.

36:34.840 --> 36:38.160
If the gentleman is not at his desk,
try the sleeping pods.

36:38.160 --> 36:39.640
Sleeping pods?

36:39.640 --> 36:42.480
Level 11. You will see.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.520

You are still in mapping?

We don't really have the... Zac!

Who's your SpAd?
Rhys Edwards. But it wasn't his.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.080
This one's jealous.

39:21.080 --> 39:24.160
Even suggested I stage
a hilarious family video.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.600
Doesn't work when the kids
are college age, McKenzie.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.120
It wasn't... It wasn't staged.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.320
James.

39:29.320 --> 39:31.120
Oh. No, nothing for me.
I can't stay.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.480
More television appearances?

39:32.480 --> 39:36.320
Home Secretary, that's actually
what I wanted to catch you about.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.920
I'm delivering the CRC report early.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.840
So, there's a copy sitting
on your desk,

39:41.840 --> 39:44.560
but just in case you fancy
a little fireside reading.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.400
Let me guess.

39:47.400 --> 39:51.080
As a Chinese-owned company,
Xanda Facial Rec are bound by law

39:51.080 --> 39:53.720
to assist Beijing in matters
of national security.

39:53.720 --> 39:56.120
Furthermore, their lack of
transparency does nothing

39:56.120 --> 39:59.680
to reassure us their AI has been
tested against racial bias.

39:59.680 --> 40:02.160
In conclusion, we find diddly squat
to support the claim

40:02.160 --> 40:05.400
that Xanda Facial Rec poses
no threat to our safety,

40:05.400 --> 40:07.960
our security, or our way of life.

40:07.960 --> 40:10.160
Then it seems I didn't need
a committee of experts.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.480
I could have just come here
for a drink.  Nonsense.

40:12.480 --> 40:15.080
Setting up committees to determine
things we already know

40:15.080 --> 40:17.720
is what we do best.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.720
HE LAUGHS

40:17.720 --> 40:20.040
So, I trust the PM will take
my recommendation

40:20.040 --> 40:21.960
and find an alternative
facial rec provider?

40:21.960 --> 40:23.560
Well, he'd be a fool not to.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.160
Oh, wait.

40:25.160 --> 40:26.840
ISAAC LAUGHS

40:26.840 --> 40:29.080
OK, well, I'd like to announce
this evening.

40:29.080 --> 40:31.560
There's a slot on Newsnight.
Why the rush?

40:31.560 --> 40:34.560
Er, Xanda are being...
not intimidating, but...

40:34.560 --> 40:36.000
Intimidating?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.960
I said NOT intimidating.

40:38.960 --> 40:42.080
Is everything all right, mate?
Anything I should know about?

40:43.120 --> 40:44.720
No, nothing. It's just, I...

40:44.720 --> 40:48.600
I feel the sooner we announce,
the stronger message we send.

40:48.600 --> 40:49.960
All right.

40:49.960 --> 40:52.440
Good plan. Make it happen.

40:52.440 --> 40:55.880
Oh, unless comms has
a problem with it.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.800
I'll give Newsnight a ring.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.440
My team can call the BBC.

40:59.440 --> 41:02.760
You're forgetting, McKenzie,
Zac's a top booking.

43:32.720 --> 43:34.480
There are armed intruders
in the building.

43:34.480 --> 43:36.760
I need you to follow me,
quickly and quietly.

43:36.760 --> 43:38.720
Well, what do you mean?

43:38.720 --> 43:40.080
Now!

43:43.320 --> 43:45.720
What the hell is it? Is it...
Is it a terrorist?

43:45.720 --> 43:47.440
How well do you know this building?

43:47.440 --> 43:50.000
I-I... I just come here to work.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.400
Looked like you were hard at it.

43:52.400 --> 43:54.280
Is there a fire door
at the bottom of this?

43:54.280 --> 43:56.000
I-I...I think so.

44:03.720 --> 44:05.400
Let's go.

44:15.200 --> 44:16.960
What now?
Just keep moving.

44:20.360 --> 44:22.440
No point.

44:22.440 --> 44:24.600
They know exactly where we are.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.200
Fucking stupid CCTV...!

44:34.600 --> 44:36.120
Now we can hide.

44:38.280 --> 44:40.680
Pick a door. Any door that opens.

44:40.680 --> 44:42.720
They're going to find us...
Bollocks they will.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.520
Armed unit should be here
any second.

44:44.520 --> 44:46.520
Soon as they hear the blues
and twos,

44:46.520 --> 44:48.280
they'll them shit themselves
and run.

44:48.280 --> 44:50.200
Here. Get in.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.440
SILENCED GUNSHOTS

44:56.200 --> 44:58.920
PHONE BUZZES

45:00.800 --> 45:02.600
Carey.

45:14.920 --> 45:17.560
Full support from the Home Secretary
and comms.  Excellent.

45:17.560 --> 45:20.360
Now, put me on Newsnight.
I'll get the BBC to send transport.

45:20.360 --> 45:23.080
Actually, you know what, I can be
home in an hour and a half.

45:23.080 --> 45:26.320
I'll do it from there.  Oh, of
course, the famous home studio.

45:26.320 --> 45:27.840
Isaac Turner?

45:29.840 --> 45:31.760
Mr Knox was the second target
from the CRC.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.920
All members may be at risk.
Well, what about my family?

45:33.920 --> 45:36.320
We've sent protection officers
directly to your home address.

45:36.320 --> 45:37.840
And who are the suspects?

45:37.840 --> 45:40.200
We'll give you a full briefing
en route to the safe house.

45:57.680 --> 46:00.480
Nadia! Nadia.

46:06.440 --> 46:08.600
They're operating on him.

46:08.600 --> 46:12.200
He's got a collapsed lung and
a second chest wound, critical.

46:13.320 --> 46:14.960
Why was he alone?

46:14.960 --> 46:17.600
Fuck you. It was a routine inquiry.

46:17.600 --> 46:20.400
And if you cared so much, you could
have helped when we asked you.

46:20.400 --> 46:22.480
This has gotten way out of hand.

46:22.480 --> 46:25.200
Let me run the case out of SO15.
We'll get the scum who did this...

46:25.200 --> 46:27.160
That's not necessary.
I've already made the call.

46:27.160 --> 46:28.800
You need a higher ranking SIO.

46:28.800 --> 46:31.080
Will detective superintendent
suffice?

46:31.080 --> 46:32.440
Ma'am.

46:32.440 --> 46:34.680
Thank you for bringing this to
my attention, both of you,

46:34.680 --> 46:36.680
in your own different ways.
The witness?

46:36.680 --> 46:38.760
Mr Knox is in the waiting room.

46:38.760 --> 46:41.080
In shock, but he's recovering.

46:41.080 --> 46:43.000
DC Tan, ma'am.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.160
Pleased to meet you.

46:45.160 --> 46:48.240
He said he can't get a visual
on the suspects,

46:48.240 --> 46:50.400
and they were gone before
the ARVs arrived.

46:50.400 --> 46:53.440
He said it sounded like
two assailants, maybe more.

46:53.440 --> 46:56.920
No eyewitnesses. The suspects have
been scrubbed from the CCTV,

46:56.920 --> 46:59.400
just like with Edison Yao.
Patrick must have seen them.

46:59.400 --> 47:01.680
Chest shot at close range,
you would have got a good look.

47:01.680 --> 47:04.320
And when he is able,
DS Flynn will give us a statement.

47:04.320 --> 47:06.640
Makes him a witness.
He'll need protection.

47:06.640 --> 47:08.760
You'll be telling us he needs
to see a doctor next.

47:08.760 --> 47:10.560
What's the status with
the committee?

47:10.560 --> 47:13.040
As instructed, ma'am, we've got
all members in transit,

47:13.040 --> 47:14.760
including Isaac Turner.

47:14.760 --> 47:16.960
Contained and controlled.
Isaac Turner, the MP?

47:16.960 --> 47:18.560
Er, Rachel. Please.

47:18.560 --> 47:20.560
DI Latif, with me.

47:22.280 --> 47:24.240
He's still in a critical condition,

47:24.240 --> 47:26.760
but you should be able to go
and see him soon.

47:40.520 --> 47:43.040
It's Yvonne, isn't it?

47:44.640 --> 47:46.800
I'm Rachel. I...

47:46.800 --> 47:49.840
I ran a big case with Patrick
in homicide, so I...

47:52.120 --> 47:54.680
I know what a bloody good bloke
he is.

47:58.600 --> 48:01.280
I don't want to intrude.
I just, erm...

48:03.200 --> 48:05.440
If there's anything I can do.

48:06.600 --> 48:09.280
You can get the bastard who did it.

48:21.640 --> 48:23.840
Yes, it must be them.

48:23.840 --> 48:26.280
They finally got to Edison,
the poor bastard,

48:26.280 --> 48:28.280
and now they've gone after Gregory.

48:28.280 --> 48:30.160
Yeah, I told these detectives

48:30.160 --> 48:32.480
exactly who they should be
looking for.

48:43.320 --> 48:45.080
Mr Knox.

48:45.080 --> 48:49.040
The protection unit are here to
transfer you to a safe location.

48:49.040 --> 48:51.440
How...how is he? He protected me.

48:51.440 --> 48:53.240
He...he saved my life.

49:02.360 --> 49:04.320
Sweetie, we're going to go.

49:04.320 --> 49:06.200
Come on, babe.

49:13.080 --> 49:15.560
MONITORS BEEP

49:17.320 --> 49:19.280
DOOR SHUTS

49:32.520 --> 49:33.760
Isaac?

49:33.760 --> 49:36.240
Yeah, don't worry about me, Eliza.
I've got my own armed militia.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.920
Isaac Turner?
I'm DSU Gemma Garland, SO15.

49:38.920 --> 49:40.960
Yes, I'm on the phone.

49:40.960 --> 49:42.240
One second.

49:42.240 --> 49:45.760
Call Rhys and tell him we're doing
Newsnight remotely.

49:45.760 --> 49:47.640
Right, OK.  Yeah?
Yeah.  Speak later.

49:47.640 --> 49:49.680
Sorry to disturb, Minister.
It's just a matter of your

49:49.680 --> 49:51.920
personal safety. I must ask you
to turn off your phone.

49:51.920 --> 49:54.440
Yes, I'm going to need a laptop
with a decent webcam,

49:54.440 --> 49:56.240
something built in
the last three years,

49:56.240 --> 49:58.120
and somewhere I can sit
and give an interview.

49:58.120 --> 50:00.800
I'm afraid that's out of
the question.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.640
Patrick.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
You better fucking wake up.

50:23.920 --> 50:25.480
We need you.

50:27.640 --> 50:29.320
I need you.

50:37.280 --> 50:40.360
No, I haven't joined them,
you big bloody idiot.

50:40.360 --> 50:42.960
I am trying to beat them.

50:42.960 --> 50:45.880
And they are watching me
day and fucking night.

50:48.680 --> 50:50.760
I've still got the CC...

50:48.680 --> 50:50.760
DOOR OPENS

50:54.080 --> 50:55.920
What do you want?

50:55.920 --> 50:57.560
I'm sorry.

50:57.560 --> 51:01.000
I just thought I'd say a prayer
for DS Flynn.

51:03.240 --> 51:05.880
You two must have been close.
I was his DI.

51:05.880 --> 51:07.600
I know who you are.

51:08.920 --> 51:12.120
You led the show on every manhunt.

51:12.120 --> 51:14.240
Operation Sycamore, too.

51:14.240 --> 51:16.440
I'm on the fast track scheme myself.

51:16.440 --> 51:20.200
We get to study past cases...
I thought you came to pray.

51:20.200 --> 51:22.280
It's an expression.

51:25.640 --> 51:28.000
What's the status on Turner?

51:30.360 --> 51:33.080
All assets are either in transit,

51:33.080 --> 51:35.520
with protection at their home
address or in safe houses.

51:35.520 --> 51:37.440
What's the link between the assets?

51:37.440 --> 51:40.400
You're not actually on
this investigation.

51:40.400 --> 51:42.200
I'm supporting it.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.760
What does that mean?

51:43.760 --> 51:46.000
It means my friend has been shot,

51:46.000 --> 51:48.560
and I want to make sure
he gets justice.

51:56.600 --> 51:59.000
Do you really think
they'll try again tonight?

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
We have to assume an ongoing threat.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.960
But no-one's going to get you here.

52:02.960 --> 52:05.760
Don't suppose there's a drop
of brandy in the cupboard?

52:09.800 --> 52:12.760
Edison Yao, Gregory Knox,
Isaac Turner -

52:12.760 --> 52:14.920
they're all on the
China Research Committee.

52:14.920 --> 52:17.480
The suspects are trying to target
the entire group.

52:17.480 --> 52:20.600
It's possible. You have to assume
any one of them could be next.

52:20.600 --> 52:23.840
As soon as we made the link,
DSU Garland put the whole lot
under lockdown.

52:23.840 --> 52:25.880
Shot through the eye.

52:25.880 --> 52:27.320
It's weird.

52:27.320 --> 52:30.360
The victim was standing at his front
door looking through the peephole.

52:30.360 --> 52:33.880
I'm thinking maybe the gunman saw
his shadow under the door.

52:33.880 --> 52:37.680
But judging by Yao's CCTV,
the light in the apartment

52:37.680 --> 52:41.400
wouldn't have made
a very visible shadow.

52:41.400 --> 52:44.160
How many assets have been placed
in safe houses?

52:46.440 --> 52:48.520
You could be walking into a trap.

52:48.520 --> 52:51.080
Whoever's behind this knows exactly
what they're doing.

52:51.080 --> 52:53.800
If they can scrub CCTV,
they can monitor it.

52:53.800 --> 52:56.560
They're probably watching your
every move. For all we know,

52:56.560 --> 52:59.240
the safe houses are exactly where
they want us to take these people.

52:59.240 --> 53:01.400
How can they target them at
a safe house?

53:01.400 --> 53:04.240
It's a house, Nadia,
not a nuclear bunker.

53:04.240 --> 53:06.960
Where's Garland?  With the MP.

53:06.960 --> 53:08.560
Where?

53:08.560 --> 53:11.480
You want me to disclose the location
of a safe house over the phone?

53:11.480 --> 53:13.480
Well, where are you, then?

53:22.920 --> 53:25.440
We have all seven members
of the CRC housed.

53:25.440 --> 53:27.720
DOOR SHUTS

53:25.440 --> 53:27.720
Update me every 30 minutes.

53:27.720 --> 53:29.560
Ma'am.
What the hell's going on?

53:29.560 --> 53:32.760
Sorry, ma'am, but I think you should
listen to DCI Carey.

53:32.760 --> 53:35.400
Whoever's doing this may have
wanted to drive the assets

53:35.400 --> 53:36.760
into police protection.

53:36.760 --> 53:39.720
For what possible reason?
To turn them into sitting ducks.

53:39.720 --> 53:41.880
You think the secure locations
have been compromised?

53:41.880 --> 53:45.280
Given the risk, I'd suggest
deploying a decoy strategy
immediately, yes.

53:45.280 --> 53:46.920
Sorry, what's the problem?

53:46.920 --> 53:49.040
There's no problem.
I heard "decoy strategy."

53:49.040 --> 53:51.360
It would involve moving you
to a second property.

53:51.360 --> 53:53.200
Why, what's wrong with this one?
Nothing.

53:53.200 --> 53:55.960
This property was selected using
specialist operation protocols,

53:55.960 --> 53:58.800
with highly vetted firearms officers
guarding each access point.

53:58.800 --> 54:00.840
Yes. And what do you think?

54:03.320 --> 54:06.240
The manner of Edison Yao's shooting
suggests the gunman

54:06.240 --> 54:08.400
had eyes inside the property
without entering it,

54:08.400 --> 54:10.360
and given he had installed
a home CCTV network...

54:10.360 --> 54:11.760
His cameras were hacked.

54:11.760 --> 54:13.720
I'm aware of the working assessment
of the case.

54:13.720 --> 54:15.960
You're saying they can see us now?
Absolutely not.

54:15.960 --> 54:18.720
The security cameras in this
property run on an isolated network

54:18.720 --> 54:20.720
installed and protected by GCHQ.

54:20.720 --> 54:23.760
I'm sure that makes them
China-proof.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.600
Minister.

54:26.640 --> 54:30.120
I have personally led
security service protection

54:30.120 --> 54:33.640
for two royal weddings
and nine state visits.

54:33.640 --> 54:36.840
The surveillance in this property,
like the entire operation,

54:36.840 --> 54:40.080
is China-proof, Russia-proof,
and, I dare say, Martian-proof.

54:40.080 --> 54:43.440
The only entity that has proved
itself capable of compromising

54:43.440 --> 54:46.320
the safe house, remarkably, appears
to be Detective Carey herself.

54:46.320 --> 54:48.560
A serious breach for which
both parties responsible

54:48.560 --> 54:50.360
will be reprimanded.

54:55.080 --> 54:56.920
I assure you...

54:56.920 --> 54:59.240
..you're quite safe here, Minister.

55:02.480 --> 55:03.720
It...

55:03.720 --> 55:06.400
It's something else, then. If it's
not threat to life, there's a...

55:06.400 --> 55:08.960
There's a reason they wanted you...
Rachel, let's just...

55:08.960 --> 55:11.320
Well, they shoot Edison Yao
at 7pm...

55:11.320 --> 55:13.280
THEY BICKER

55:13.280 --> 55:15.800
TV:  In a moment, I'll be speaking
live to the minister in charge

55:15.800 --> 55:17.560
of the report, Isaac Turner.

55:17.560 --> 55:19.280
Oh, fuck!

55:19.280 --> 55:21.800
Er, I... I need my phone.
Government business.

55:21.800 --> 55:24.640
Mr Turner, your phone is
a security risk.  OK, any phone.

55:24.640 --> 55:27.160
I need to call the BBC. They still
think I'm going on tonight.

55:27.160 --> 55:29.400
Apparently, no-one on my staff
thought to...tell them...

55:29.400 --> 55:31.960
TV:  Well, I'm now joined by
Home Office Security Minister

55:31.960 --> 55:34.040
Isaac Turner. Good evening.

55:34.040 --> 55:35.760
Good evening, Khadija.

55:37.320 --> 55:42.040
Would Xanda Facial Recognition make
Britain more safe or less?

55:42.040 --> 55:44.640
Well, the Government's official
announcement regarding

55:44.640 --> 55:47.280
the UK borders contract will be made
within a matter of days.

55:47.280 --> 55:49.560
With respect, Minister,
that's not what I asked.

55:49.560 --> 55:51.400
NADIA:  This is a recording, right?

55:51.400 --> 55:54.120
The China Research Committee
has concluded its report,

55:54.120 --> 55:56.440
and I've delivered my recommendation
to the Home Secretary.

55:56.440 --> 55:58.360
Wh-what... What's happening?

55:58.360 --> 56:00.240
Obviously, the Prime Minister
has the final say.

56:00.240 --> 56:02.320
But I'm confident he'll make
the right decision.

56:02.320 --> 56:05.240
And what is the right decision,
according to you?

56:07.720 --> 56:09.920
This is it.

56:09.920 --> 56:11.520
The reason they wanted you here.

56:11.520 --> 56:13.480
Minister?

56:13.480 --> 56:17.320
Well, we made a promise to keep
Britain's borders safe.

56:17.320 --> 56:20.000
The safest system is the most
accurate system.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.680
So, I believe the right decision

56:22.680 --> 56:26.520
is to award the UK borders contract
to Xanda Facial Recognition.

56:28.120 --> 56:32.360
Not long ago, you were quoted as
saying that outsourcing UK

56:32.360 --> 56:35.960
surveillance to China was like
handing a British radar contract

56:35.960 --> 56:38.840
to Germany in 1939.

56:38.840 --> 56:41.520
I've done my research,
and I've found no evidence

56:41.520 --> 56:44.880
of a link between Xanda
and the Chinese authorities.

56:44.880 --> 56:47.200
As Britain's Security Minister,

56:47.200 --> 56:49.880
I fully support
the CRC's conclusion.

56:51.480 --> 56:56.720
The use of Chinese AI technology
poses no threat to our safety,

56:56.720 --> 56:59.840
our security, or our way of life.
