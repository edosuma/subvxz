Thanks, guys!

02:29.357 --> 02:30.775
Uh-oh!

02:30.859 --> 02:32.110
Roasting!

02:32.193 --> 02:34.362
No, it's not roasting!

02:34.445 --> 02:36.030
This is toasting.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.740
This is just amazing.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.827
I don't know if you notice,
but just like all the eyes,

02:40.910 --> 02:44.330
all the faces that were
in the wings watching you,

02:44.414 --> 02:48.710
you've affected them
and you've made this place so great.

02:48.793 --> 02:54.632
I've appreciated every moment,
and I just-- I love you.

02:59.596 --> 03:03.892
I realize I've seen each of you guys
come into the company.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.977
I met Ash when he was 13 years old.

03:07.312 --> 03:12.609
And you guys all came in
as the, like, younger, new people.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.903
But when I look at you now,

03:14.986 --> 03:18.489
I realize how much I've learned
from each of you.

03:18.573 --> 03:23.328
You're incredible people, and I feel
so lucky that you're in my life.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.711
<i>I've always been</i>
<i>extremely devoted to what I do...</i>

03:33.713 --> 03:37.133
<i>and I love being a part</i>
<i>of the New York City Ballet...</i>

03:39.052 --> 03:41.471
<i>but I do feel the ticking clock</i>

03:41.554 --> 03:46.517
<i>and, at times, I've thought</i>
<i>if I don't dance, I'd rather die.</i>

03:47.936 --> 03:49.437
<i>I've actually said that.</i>

04:34.399 --> 04:36.150
- Can I take a picture?
- Of course!

04:39.404 --> 04:41.906
Where's your camera? Right here, yeah?

04:44.117 --> 04:45.118
Yay!

04:46.244 --> 04:48.121
We want to do front.

04:48.204 --> 04:52.500
One, push back, two, tours en l'air,

04:52.583 --> 04:56.629
One, two, three, Prussian four, pirouette.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.048
Press six, go to our sides.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.592
Seven, eight, okay? Two coupes.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.761
Ready, one?

05:09.809 --> 05:11.853
<i>Ballet can be tough on the body,</i>

05:11.936 --> 05:14.397
<i>and the New York City's work</i>
<i>is so extreme</i>

05:14.480 --> 05:18.151
<i>that to do it for a long time,</i>
<i>it really plays havoc with you.</i>

05:20.653 --> 05:22.697
<i>But I just want to do something well.</i>

05:25.408 --> 05:27.452
To be a dancer at 47, you can't--

05:27.535 --> 05:32.040
ballet dancer at 47,
it's hard to keep doing that well.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.751
<i>Wendy Whelan is here.</i>

05:34.834 --> 05:39.005
Since 1991, she's been a principal dancer
with the New York City Ballet.

05:39.088 --> 05:42.925
She is considered to be one
of the great ballerinas performing today.

05:44.260 --> 05:48.306
<i>Ballet superstar Wendy Whelan</i>
<i>inspires a kind of rapture</i>

05:48.389 --> 05:51.934
<i>in dance critics and choreographers alike.</i>

05:52.018 --> 05:55.938
<i>When you see her move, you understand.</i>

05:57.356 --> 06:00.359
<i>Wendy Whelan</i>
<i>is a national treasure</i>

06:00.443 --> 06:03.654
<i>who is always taking us beyond.</i>

06:07.909 --> 06:11.746
<i>She's a dancer</i>
<i>for all seasons, all -isms.</i>

06:11.829 --> 06:15.500
<i>She's absolutely magic</i>
<i>in the Balanchine repertoire.</i>

06:16.709 --> 06:20.213
<i>I'm still fascinated</i>
<i>with Balanchine's choreography.</i>

06:20.296 --> 06:22.924
<i>I never stopped learning</i>
<i>about those ballets.</i>

06:23.007 --> 06:25.259
<i>They constantly reveal new things to me.</i>

06:26.302 --> 06:29.388
<i>But the first year I was there,</i>
<i>Balanchine died.</i>

06:29.472 --> 06:33.392
<i>I worked with Jerome Robbins</i>
<i>for 12 years on a daily basis.</i>

06:33.476 --> 06:37.021
<i>Since I didn't have Balanchine,</i>
<i>I feel incredibly lucky to have had him.</i>

06:40.608 --> 06:43.236
<i>After Balanchine,</i>
<i>Peter Martins took the helm,</i>

06:43.319 --> 06:47.240
<i>and he chose me pretty early on</i>
<i>because I was a strong dancer.</i>

06:52.161 --> 06:56.165
Every once in a while
when somebody pops up with that gift,

06:56.249 --> 06:58.709
it's not rocket science, you know.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.878
It's very easy to identify.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.839
You just grab it.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.221
<i>After 30 years with the company,</i>

07:10.304 --> 07:13.099
<i>nobody in the history</i>
<i>of New York City Ballet</i>

07:13.182 --> 07:16.686
<i>has had more new works made upon them.</i>

07:16.769 --> 07:22.984
Wendy has been one
of the great originators of new roles,

07:23.067 --> 07:26.279
and shaped contemporary ballet today,

07:26.362 --> 07:28.906
<i>shaped the work of William Forsythe,</i>

07:28.990 --> 07:32.160
<i>Christopher Wheeldon,</i>
<i>Alexei Ratmansky.</i>

07:36.873 --> 07:39.083
<i>I had the world in my hands.</i>

07:40.960 --> 07:43.337
<i>I was getting every part under the sun.</i>

07:43.421 --> 07:45.923
<i>They were like, "Wendy, this is yours.</i>
<i>This is yours. This is yours."</i>

07:46.007 --> 07:50.595
<i>All these gifts coming, it was like gold</i>
<i>streaming into my world.</i>

07:50.678 --> 07:53.139
<i>But as soon as I started</i>
<i>to achieve success</i>

07:53.222 --> 07:56.350
and thought, "This is pretty amazing,

07:56.434 --> 08:01.439
I'm actually feeling
what I wanted to feel my whole life,

08:01.522 --> 08:04.358
I'm at this place, I'm recognized,

08:04.442 --> 08:07.195
uh, I'm doing things...

08:07.278 --> 08:10.740
What the fuck is it gonna be like
when I can't do this anymore?"

08:17.413 --> 08:18.539
It's okay.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.000
Don't let the right pelvis drop.
That's it.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.168
So you want to stay nice

08:22.251 --> 08:24.921
and in that neutral training region
of your pelvis

08:25.004 --> 08:26.714
while your hip joint's moving.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.176
Had a weird pain this morning.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.929
-I, uh... Yeah.
-On the outside?

08:33.010 --> 08:37.265
Which, I was like, "Probably need to find
that cartilage farmer."

08:37.350 --> 08:38.851
-Cartilage farmer.
-Yeah.

08:38.933 --> 08:41.145
-You know, you probably just...
-The guy that grows the cartilage!

08:41.229 --> 08:44.315
-...activated the muscle too quickly--
-It kind of was like--

08:44.398 --> 08:46.400
-Jammed together?
-When it's raw up in your tooth?

08:46.484 --> 08:48.736
It's on the outside
rather than the groin area, right?

08:48.819 --> 08:51.697
-Yeah, or the labrally thing.
-The labrally area.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.492
<i>I have a labral tear.</i>

08:54.575 --> 08:55.993
<i>A lot of people have it.</i>

08:56.077 --> 08:57.954
<i>Some people can continue</i>
<i>to dance through it.</i>

08:58.037 --> 09:01.791
I've tried and tried and tried
for the past, like, ten months,

09:01.874 --> 09:03.834
and tried everything.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.295
It's debilitated me to a certain level,

09:06.379 --> 09:09.423
so I've just focused
on certain pieces that I can do.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.925
I don't have to do <i>Nutcracker.</i>

09:11.008 --> 09:13.761
I don't-- I want to do
the fall season, but...

09:13.844 --> 09:15.346
-I was wondering about that.
-I have to just let it go.

09:15.429 --> 09:17.431
Yeah, I have to let it go.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.766
Do you have to have surgery
or something?

09:18.849 --> 09:19.850
I do.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.352
-You do?
-Yeah. Hopefully I'll be back

09:21.435 --> 09:23.479
doing something at City Ballet.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.356
It depends on how I heal.

09:25.439 --> 09:29.610
I'm trying to get strong in certain areas
and be really ready for the surgery,

09:29.694 --> 09:33.447
so I'm trying to be wise beforehand
to counter a lengthy recovery,

09:33.531 --> 09:35.533
keep it as short as possible.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.496
So, like, how do you feel today?

09:40.580 --> 09:41.581
Well...

09:41.664 --> 09:42.665
Other than sore.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.000
Really sore!

09:44.083 --> 09:45.710
What is the procedure?

09:45.793 --> 09:47.837
Like, give me a little information.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.338
I don't really know anything.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.007
It's just an arthroscopy,

09:51.090 --> 09:52.675
so it shouldn't be a big deal,

09:52.758 --> 09:56.095
-but they go in two sides--
-Oh!

09:56.178 --> 09:57.638
-...my hip.
-Okay.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.974
-They clean up a tear that's in there.
-Yeah.

10:00.057 --> 10:03.019
I just-- I'll be so excited to know
that it goes well,

10:03.102 --> 10:07.064
and then hopefully will feel a bit
like my old self again.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.149
Mm-hmm.

10:08.232 --> 10:11.527
It's hard for me to believe I'll ever
feel like that, but I hope I will.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.529
You can head in that direction.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.513
My whole career, 43 years of dancing,

10:39.597 --> 10:41.432
I've had such minimal pain.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.351
That's a really lucky thing,

10:43.434 --> 10:45.436
but two of the last three shows,

10:45.519 --> 10:48.064
to cross from one side
of the stage to the other,

10:48.147 --> 10:51.776
the pain I felt, just walking, was...

10:53.277 --> 10:55.196
it's just shocking.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.450
And, uh, Dr. Philippon
called me on the phone,

10:59.533 --> 11:04.372
and he said that he thought
that surgery could really help my issues.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.874
He's one of the top
hip specialists in the world,

11:06.957 --> 11:11.462
and he's designed surgical treatments
for torn labrum.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.714
That's why a lot of athletes go to him.

11:13.798 --> 11:17.259
Like, big-time athletes.

11:17.343 --> 11:22.014
Because they need
to get back in the game, and...

11:22.098 --> 11:23.974
I guess I'm one of those people.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.643
Need to get back in the game

11:25.726 --> 11:29.480
'cause I don't have
a ton of time left at my game.

11:34.610 --> 11:37.530
If you'll just-- right now,
if you'll have a seat right, and then--

11:41.033 --> 11:43.786
-So, Dr. Philippon saw you--
-Thursday, yeah.

11:43.869 --> 11:44.870
-Thursday.
-Uh-huh.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.622
How long's your hip been bothering you?

11:46.705 --> 11:48.165
-Um, almost a year.
-Almost a year.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.542
Like, September last year.

11:49.625 --> 11:50.918
Yeah, where does it bother you?

11:51.001 --> 11:53.170
Uh, where does it not bother me?

11:53.254 --> 11:55.881
-Um, a lot in the front.
-Yeah.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.300
-Some in the back.
-Any problems with your left hip?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.719
No, not that I know of.
-Any problems with your back?

12:00.803 --> 12:03.347
-I have some scoliosis, yeah.
-Okay.

12:03.431 --> 12:07.226
Dr. Philippon was very impressed
that I made it this far

12:07.309 --> 12:08.978
with the back the way I have it, so...

12:09.061 --> 12:10.938
-Okay.
-So, whoa.

12:11.021 --> 12:14.817
You've done a pretty good job
of dealing with that curvature, so...

12:14.900 --> 12:18.154
Okay, so we talk
about possible labral debridement,

12:18.237 --> 12:20.364
-repair, or reconstruction.
-Uh-huh.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.992
So, the labrum's the little bumper
that's around your socket.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.245
There's a chance that it's torn,
and he'll use sutures to repair it

12:26.328 --> 12:27.872
-back down to the socket...
-Uh-huh.

12:27.955 --> 12:31.375
...or there's a chance
that it's really badly torn,

12:31.459 --> 12:34.044
and in that instance Dr. Philippon's
developed a technique

12:34.128 --> 12:37.131
where he'll reconstruct it, taking
some tissue from the side of your...

12:37.214 --> 12:39.175
from the side of your hip area.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.387
My first ever IV.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.389
That's incredible.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.016
This is quite a costume.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.309
It's hysterical.

12:48.392 --> 12:51.395
Yay. All right, I'm sending this one.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.521
Awesome.

12:52.605 --> 12:56.650
So, we're ready to roll,
and we'll do the epidural in the room,

12:56.734 --> 12:59.653
and we'll, uh,
get you going on your recovery.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.113
Awesome. Thank you so much.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.032
Okay. Any questions?

13:03.115 --> 13:04.909
No, these guys have me covered.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.702
-They're all amazing.
-Okay. All right.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.704
-Thanks. Okay.
-See you in a few minutes.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.969
What I do now is I just kind of

13:24.053 --> 13:28.307
gently outline her anatomy...

13:47.701 --> 13:50.538
- Right hip.
- Right side.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.166
Okay, doctor, gonna start here.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.336
Nine CCs.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.506
...standby, please.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.151
Let's turn this off
in the background, okay, guys?

14:26.365 --> 14:30.119
So, Wendy...
Everything is going well, Wendy.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.914
-Awesome.
-Yes, everything is going very well.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.717
So, we're gonna need
to micro-fracture fixes right now.

14:52.683 --> 14:57.021
Creating channels for the blood
to come to the surface

14:57.104 --> 14:58.898
and create powdering.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.068
Are you comfortable?

15:04.320 --> 15:09.742
It's amazing to me, as a surgeon,
to see what kind of abilities

15:09.825 --> 15:13.329
she has with this hip that's...

15:13.412 --> 15:17.666
extremely, extremely inflamed.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.171
Ballerinas are probably God's...

15:23.172 --> 15:24.840
best athletes.

15:27.301 --> 15:30.679
-This is her labrum, and--
-Look at the tear, ooh!

15:30.763 --> 15:32.598
-It's ragged.
-Raggedy.

15:32.681 --> 15:36.644
Wow! No, it's entirely blown out here.

15:39.563 --> 15:41.941
Okay, guys, we're ready for the graft.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.867
So, we're introducing the graft.

15:53.118 --> 15:56.538
This is a reconstruction of her labrum

15:56.622 --> 15:58.999
that will help her stability,

15:59.083 --> 16:02.503
and help protect her cartilage.

16:22.940 --> 16:27.152
<i>I've been lucky to have had</i>
<i>a very strong body</i>

16:27.236 --> 16:30.364
<i>that has kept me basically injury-free.</i>

16:33.492 --> 16:35.369
<i>When you've been doing it</i>
<i>for your whole life,</i>

16:35.452 --> 16:36.578
<i>since you were three years old...</i>

16:38.247 --> 16:40.290
<i>it's pretty hard to think</i>

16:40.374 --> 16:45.004
<i>that you're not gonna put</i>
<i>pointe shoes on someday, you know?</i>

16:46.463 --> 16:50.217
<i>Ballet is a very specific design</i>

16:50.300 --> 16:53.637
<i>of movement and physicality.</i>

16:54.972 --> 16:58.058
<i>You can master it for a certain amount</i>
<i>of time to a certain degree,</i>

16:58.142 --> 17:01.061
<i>but then it will end.</i>

17:03.605 --> 17:06.775
<i>You might not necessarily know</i>
<i>when that's gonna happen... </i>

17:06.858 --> 17:10.154
<i>It might just kind of bite</i>
<i>you in the butt.</i>

17:12.114 --> 17:17.327
<i>It can really surprise you when it's like,</i>
<i>"Oh, God. I used to do that.</i>

17:17.411 --> 17:20.122
<i>I can't do that anymore. I worked</i>
<i>for 20 years to be able to do that.</i>

17:20.204 --> 17:22.082
<i>I mastered it,</i>
<i>I did it, I did it, I did it...</i>

17:22.165 --> 17:23.959
<i>I can't do it anymore."</i>

17:24.041 --> 17:25.919
<i>It's really depressing.</i>

17:27.087 --> 17:30.716
<i>You know, and you'll never</i>
<i>really do it again, possibly.</i>

17:42.978 --> 17:44.063
- Whew!
- It's done!

17:44.146 --> 17:46.065
- You look good.
- You look great.

17:46.148 --> 17:49.443
- You look really good.
- Your first surgery.

17:49.526 --> 17:51.737
-My first surgery.
-And hopefully your last!

17:51.820 --> 17:53.113
Yes!

17:53.197 --> 17:55.199
She told me all the things they did.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.035
Do you have any numbness still?

17:58.118 --> 17:59.995
I have numbness all over still.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.122
Okay, that's good. That's great.

18:02.206 --> 18:05.375
I just started
to do the little tiny bit of...

18:05.459 --> 18:07.961
-Good. Good!
-Can-can down there.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.214
-Yeah!
-But your blood pressure is good.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.216
-Your heart rate is good.
-Thank you.

18:12.299 --> 18:15.844
I'll let you rest. All right. All right.

18:24.728 --> 18:29.274
How am I doing this? Aah... ha ha!

18:32.194 --> 18:34.363
Get this leg up under you.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.740
I'm holding this leg,
so you don't put anything on that.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.450
Okay. I did it.

18:38.534 --> 18:39.576
-Okay?
-Yeah.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.245
-I'm still holding this one.
-Okay.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.333
I am doing so well.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.419
Yeah, my motion is way better today.

18:57.928 --> 19:01.223
Hi, Dummy!

19:04.810 --> 19:06.728
Good to see you walk.

19:07.729 --> 19:11.525
Wen! Wow, wow!

19:11.608 --> 19:14.945
That's good!

19:15.028 --> 19:16.989
-Right on.
-Heel-toe.

19:17.072 --> 19:19.783
I would say
that was worth a trip from Berlin.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.957
...make it? Good.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.834
Come over.
We'll view the X-ray.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.878
-Okay.
-So...

19:30.961 --> 19:33.797
-This is after the surgery.
-Yeah?

19:33.881 --> 19:38.677
And the most important thing,
for me, is the joint space.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.430
For me the two-millimeter rule
is very important.

19:41.513 --> 19:44.683
She's just at two or above,
so it's very important.

19:44.766 --> 19:48.395
Especially for her
if she's gonna keep dancing.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.731
I keep mentioning that you
can see her spine.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.692
Isn't that weird?
It's crazy, that top one.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.861
-She really has the--
-It's like, "Aah!"

19:55.944 --> 19:59.865
She had a bad scoliosis.
Despite the scoliosis, her pelvis...

19:59.948 --> 20:02.701
- At a level.
- Very level, so it's amazing.

20:02.784 --> 20:07.080
So, do you think this two-millimeter thing
is gonna get smaller?

20:07.164 --> 20:09.124
-Well...
-If I keep it strong?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.001
I think the key's your muscles.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.754
If I had come a little later,
I might not have been as lucky, right?

20:13.837 --> 20:15.088
Later, I wouldn't have done it.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.591
-We wouldn't have be able to--
-Couldn't have been able to do it.

20:17.674 --> 20:18.717
Yep.

20:36.276 --> 20:37.778
Don't make me fall!

20:37.861 --> 20:41.073
I actually wanted to ask you
just before, are you getting calls...?

20:41.156 --> 20:43.659
-Huh?
-Are you getting calls from there?

20:43.742 --> 20:46.203
-New York City Ballet?
-Yeah, like, people saying hi.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.039
Yeah, no, not many,
and then I've read places

20:49.122 --> 20:50.666
that people are now calling me

20:50.749 --> 20:53.043
the former ballerina
of New York City Ballet.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.879
Eww! You're Wendy fucking Whelan.

20:55.963 --> 21:00.592
I know, but, like, a lot of people think
I retired already, yeah,

21:00.676 --> 21:02.594
and I'm just like, "Really?"

21:02.678 --> 21:06.306
People are getting the message
because they don't see me onstage,

21:06.390 --> 21:10.686
whether it be because I'm not cast
in something or because I'm injured, so...

21:10.769 --> 21:12.980
It's just, you know, weird, ha ha.

21:13.063 --> 21:18.151
Whenever that comes,
do you have a vision for a program, for...

21:18.235 --> 21:23.615
Not really, but deep down
always wanted to, like, slip out.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.410
I don't want to make it
feel like there's an end,

21:26.493 --> 21:28.954
and when you have confetti
and flowers come down on you,

21:29.037 --> 21:31.123
it's an end, right?

21:31.206 --> 21:34.584
-Versus just a progression into...?
-Yeah. Yeah.

21:34.668 --> 21:35.919
I'm about exploring.

21:36.003 --> 21:39.506
I'm not about, like,
what I did and it's over.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.968
I'm not, I mean-- So, what I kind
of want to end on is something new.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.762
And I do it once.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.890
I do it one time, and then I leave.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.483
-Let's see first-- Let's get these...
-Yeah.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.777
You don't need them anymore.
Look at that!

22:02.988 --> 22:05.365
...little bit before we start doing that.

22:05.449 --> 22:06.575
What?

22:13.248 --> 22:16.460
It's not like it's--
It doesn't hurt at all, it's just jumping.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.003
-Jumping?
-Yeah.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.130
Stretch it a little bit this way.

22:21.381 --> 22:24.176
Ahh! I think that's from the past year.

22:24.259 --> 22:25.260
Yeah.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.893
We're going to Lynn Goldberg's house.

22:32.976 --> 22:37.481
She's a real good friend of a lot
of the dancers, including me.

22:37.564 --> 22:39.316
Uh, should be fun.

22:39.399 --> 22:41.860
I haven't spent a whole lot of time
with dancers lately,

22:41.943 --> 22:44.946
so should be kind of weird
'cause I don't--

22:45.030 --> 22:47.991
definitely don't feel like
a dancer right now.

22:48.075 --> 22:51.203
And... um...

22:51.286 --> 22:53.580
Jock Soto will be there.

22:53.663 --> 22:59.586
And Jock is one of my, um, partners
from my career at New York City Ballet.

22:59.669 --> 23:03.632
We had a really
kind of celebrated partnership...

23:05.092 --> 23:08.428
for 15 years or so?

23:30.158 --> 23:33.870
<i>He made me look and he made me feel</i>
<i>like a really great dancer.</i>

23:33.954 --> 23:37.082
<i>It's hard to find a partner</i>
<i>that makes you look that great.</i>

23:38.875 --> 23:42.504
<i>You know, ballet is handed down</i>
<i>from generation to generation.</i>

23:42.587 --> 23:45.006
<i>Jock's a generation before me,</i>

23:45.090 --> 23:48.802
<i>and I'm a generation before my partners,</i>
<i>Craig Hall and Tyler Angle.</i>

23:48.885 --> 23:52.264
<i>And Jock's most recent partner</i>
<i>before me was Heather Watts.</i>

23:54.850 --> 23:57.894
<i>Heather taught him how to partner her,</i>

23:57.978 --> 24:02.274
<i>and I helped my partners,</i>
<i>Craig and Tyler, take on Jock's roles.</i>

24:04.484 --> 24:08.947
<i>So it's very much like woman to man,</i>
<i>man to woman.</i>

24:10.532 --> 24:12.576
<i>Wendy was very patient with me.</i>

24:12.659 --> 24:15.036
<i>I think when I got out there,</i>
<i>my biggest problem was</i>

24:15.120 --> 24:16.454
I didn't know how to breathe.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.166
I was so nervous and scared
to work with her.

24:20.375 --> 24:22.210
<i>By the time</i>
<i>I was dancing with Wendy,</i>

24:22.294 --> 24:23.628
<i>which was even after Craig,</i>

24:23.712 --> 24:27.883
I mean, she was already
the finest instrument,

24:27.966 --> 24:30.802
you know what I mean?
She was already the Stradivarius.

24:30.886 --> 24:36.141
<i>And so we had to start learning</i>
<i>how to play that instrument.</i>

24:38.768 --> 24:43.773
<i>Right after Jock left the company,</i>
<i>we danced </i> After the Rain <i>together.</i>

24:43.857 --> 24:48.111
<i>When I started,</i>
<i>I was clearly trying to mimic Jock,</i>

24:48.195 --> 24:52.240
<i>but she didn't want to dance with Jock</i>
<i>through me, you know?</i>

24:52.324 --> 24:54.159
<i>She wanted to dance with you.</i>

24:54.242 --> 24:57.245
<i>She wanted a level</i>
<i>of collaboration and commitment</i>

24:57.329 --> 25:00.749
<i>that I didn't fully understand</i>
<i>until my partnership with her.</i>

25:00.832 --> 25:04.544
<i>I mean, you just had to be there 150%.</i>

25:08.465 --> 25:11.676
<i>At first, I think it scared me</i>
<i>because there was such intensity,</i>

25:11.760 --> 25:13.094
<i>and I wasn't at that level.</i>

25:13.178 --> 25:15.639
<i>It's like, "This is too much."</i>
<i>Like, "Calm down, please."</i>

25:15.722 --> 25:18.850
But she, like, drew me in
and it's like, "No, I'm not.

25:18.934 --> 25:23.605
I'm, like, bringing you into a world
that you will learn to love."

25:26.191 --> 25:29.194
<i>When you dance together,</i>
<i>you fall in love.</i>

25:29.277 --> 25:31.655
<i>You know, you really do,</i>
<i>you love that person.</i>

25:33.365 --> 25:38.703
<i>And I've, you know, I feel that way</i>
<i>for all the guys I've danced with.</i>

25:39.996 --> 25:43.667
Oh, my God, that Wendy Whelan
is so heavy.

25:46.253 --> 25:49.923
All she eats is pizza and hamburgers.
And just beer.

25:50.006 --> 25:51.841
I mean, hello!

25:53.510 --> 25:54.844
Oh, everybody!

25:59.057 --> 26:01.184
Shall we put you on the rocking chair?

26:01.268 --> 26:04.980
Wah-wah! Whoa! Aah!
That would be really attractive.

26:05.063 --> 26:07.357
It's slippery in here.

26:08.692 --> 26:10.694
-I'm gonna take these off.
-She knows what she's doing.

26:10.777 --> 26:13.363
Um, can you put those somewhere?

26:13.446 --> 26:16.866
Yeah, Wendy,
I feel like the worst friend ever.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.451
I haven't seen you yet.

26:18.535 --> 26:19.661
You've been busy, girl.

26:19.744 --> 26:21.329
I know, it's been nuts, but...

26:21.413 --> 26:23.039
-Come here!
-How are you feeling?

26:23.123 --> 26:24.666
-Don't drop the wine, though.
-I know.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.918
Good! Mwah!
So good to see you.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.004
Nice to see you! Mwah!

26:29.087 --> 26:30.839
Have you been dancing your buns off?

26:30.922 --> 26:35.427
Well, this week, yeah,
'cause there was some injuries and...

26:36.261 --> 26:37.595
You look so good.

26:38.596 --> 26:41.975
Yeah! What's going on this week?
What do you have coming up?

26:42.058 --> 26:44.311
-Uh...
-Did you do-- did you do any--

26:44.394 --> 26:47.355
-You did <i>Western, </i> right?
-Yeah, one night.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.441
And then after the season,
is there a break?

26:49.524 --> 26:51.234
We have, like, five days.
Then we go to Japan.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.652
-Oh, five days.
-Yeah.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.863
I'm so out of everything.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.574
I don't look at the--
The schedule comes every night,

26:57.657 --> 26:59.159
and I go "delete!"

26:59.242 --> 27:01.953
-So I have, like...
-It's better that way.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.079
I can't, yeah.

27:16.634 --> 27:21.639
<i>When all of this started,</i>
<i>I was having a bit of a phase</i>

27:21.723 --> 27:23.600
<i>at New York City Ballet where...</i>

27:23.683 --> 27:25.602
they were sort of taking me
out of things

27:25.685 --> 27:31.858
without talking with me about it,
sort of things that I've always done

27:31.941 --> 27:36.279
were all of a sudden not mine anymore.

27:37.364 --> 27:40.742
<i>And this happened at the same time.</i>

27:40.825 --> 27:45.997
<i>I can't take personally the fact</i>
<i>that a lot of people,</i>

27:46.081 --> 27:48.958
<i>like my boss, Peter Martins,</i>
<i>or certain ballet masters,</i>

27:49.042 --> 27:52.462
<i>like, literally don't speak to me at work.</i>

27:53.588 --> 27:56.007
<i>I'm only assuming that</i>

27:56.091 --> 28:01.096
<i>that kind of behavior</i>
<i>is the message for me to go.</i>

28:02.555 --> 28:05.725
<i>I even had a meeting with Peter Martins</i>
<i>a couple years ago</i>

28:05.809 --> 28:09.521
<i>when all this started,</i>
<i>and he basically said, you know...</i>

28:10.605 --> 28:13.691
<i>like, it's hard to say it,</i>
<i>'cause it's kind of devastating,</i>

28:13.775 --> 28:16.694
but he took me out of <i>The Nutcracker.</i>

28:16.778 --> 28:18.988
He said, "I don't think
you should do this anymore."

28:19.072 --> 28:20.490
Two years ago.

28:21.491 --> 28:22.909
And I was like, "Why?"

28:22.992 --> 28:25.495
And he said, "Well, it's up to you.

28:25.578 --> 28:28.248
I mean, I'm just trying to make...

28:28.331 --> 28:30.834
I just don't want people
to see you in decline."

28:31.960 --> 28:33.169
And I was like...

28:35.130 --> 28:37.882
"I'm... I'm in decline? Am I that bad?"

28:39.050 --> 28:42.554
He's like, "No, no, you could do
a lot of things still."

28:42.637 --> 28:44.305
My little prince in <i>The Nutcracker!</i>

28:44.389 --> 28:47.976
<i>I had never, ever been told,</i>

28:48.059 --> 28:50.353
<i>"If it's my call,</i>
<i>I'm not putting you on stage."</i>

28:50.437 --> 28:51.521
<i>Couldn't believe it.</i>

28:54.482 --> 28:56.526
<i>So, that was two years ago.</i>

28:56.609 --> 28:58.945
<i>My body started hurting that January.</i>

28:59.028 --> 29:01.197
<i>I've never been in pain my whole life.</i>

29:01.281 --> 29:04.951
My toes never bled,
my back was fine.

29:05.034 --> 29:06.911
I mean, I had little issues
here and there,

29:06.995 --> 29:09.998
but I had never been
in debilitating pain

29:10.081 --> 29:11.541
until I had that meeting.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.963
And it, like, started to eat me up.

29:17.046 --> 29:18.882
It started to take everything from me.

29:18.965 --> 29:22.552
It started to steal what I had,

29:22.635 --> 29:27.223
and things started
to, like, I'm out of control.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.350
I can't do...

29:30.810 --> 29:32.979
And it-- it was just the weirdest thing.

29:33.062 --> 29:37.650
And it was, like,
fine before that meeting.

29:42.822 --> 29:45.283
Oh, they can hear me coming.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.786
They're getting very squeaky.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.705
They're getting old
and they're ready to retire.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.833
-Wendy, how are you?
-No! Hi! I'm good. How are you?

29:53.917 --> 29:56.002
-It's good, good.
-Good to see you.

29:56.085 --> 29:57.837
-No, but I know--
-Should I just get rid of them?

29:57.921 --> 30:00.673
-Come on in.
-I'm so ready!

30:00.757 --> 30:02.258
I know she's done it already.

30:02.342 --> 30:03.259
-I haven't!
-No?

30:03.343 --> 30:05.053
-No, she hasn't.
-Trust me. Believe it.

30:05.136 --> 30:08.097
Here's what we're gonna do.
Let's have you walk to that room there.

30:08.181 --> 30:09.808
-Yeah?
-Keep the crutches on...

30:09.891 --> 30:12.477
-All right.
-But, uh, just, like, heel--

30:12.560 --> 30:14.687
-Do the 50?
-Yeah. No, no, do the whole weight.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.397
-Just...
-Normal weight?

30:16.481 --> 30:19.150
Yeah, normal weight,
but keep the crutches on just for balance.

30:19.234 --> 30:21.736
It's gonna feel funny at first
because you haven't put weight on it.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.822
Yeah, it's really weird.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.406
I feel like I've been drinking.

30:25.490 --> 30:29.285
Because sometimes the foot
will feel numb, actually.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.621
Wow. Makes me lightheaded a little bit.

30:31.704 --> 30:32.956
-Is that normal?
-Yeah.

30:33.039 --> 30:35.291
Please say it's normal. Okay!

30:35.375 --> 30:39.462
Okay, now, bring both
of your knees to your chest.

30:39.546 --> 30:42.632
Mm-hmm. Just using my stomach?

30:42.715 --> 30:46.845
Yeah. That's parallel.
Yeah, that's excellent.

30:46.928 --> 30:48.263
Let me take a picture of this.

30:48.346 --> 30:51.766
I'm gonna blot your eyes, Wendy,
so nobody's gonna see you.

30:51.850 --> 30:56.020
Oh, I'm actually... pretty open to...

30:56.104 --> 30:57.480
I'll be proud.

30:57.564 --> 31:00.567
-But keep, uh...
-No, okay.

31:00.650 --> 31:03.194
-Usually what I see, Wendy...
-Mm-hmm?

31:03.278 --> 31:06.865
...is this leg drags behind,
and yours is perfectly parallel.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.033
-Close. It's a little bit--
-That's definitely--

31:09.117 --> 31:12.161
-It feels a little bit, just, not--
-Okay.

31:15.707 --> 31:20.003
Oh, my God! Watch, watch, watch, watch!

31:23.089 --> 31:26.843
Oh! Oh, my gosh!

31:30.346 --> 31:31.890
Now can you carry me back?

31:33.224 --> 31:36.352
That's good. You'll be, like,
dancing, like, in no time

31:36.436 --> 31:37.604
'cause you're strong.

31:37.687 --> 31:39.355
-Well, he asked me today...
-Yeah?

31:39.439 --> 31:42.191
...what... when I wanted to try
to start dancing,

31:42.275 --> 31:45.445
and I was like, "Well, I didn't know
I had the option to tell you, like..."

31:45.528 --> 31:46.821
I wouldn't think so, either.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.573
I said, "Well, if I...

31:48.656 --> 31:51.159
Do you think I could dance
at the beginning of December?"

31:51.242 --> 31:54.829
And he said, "I like the sound of that."

31:54.913 --> 31:57.290
-Really? Wow.
-Yeah, so... Yeah.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.835
I remember that
when we were doing <i>The Nutcracker,</i>

32:00.919 --> 32:04.213
and we were taking ballet
at Louisville Ballet School.

32:04.297 --> 32:07.258
-Oh, yeah! I have pictures from that, too.
-Yeah, me too.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.510
How old were you when you stopped
dancing?

32:09.594 --> 32:12.138
-Well-- 22.
-Twenty-two. I left at 22.

32:12.221 --> 32:14.474
You don't miss it, though.
You're good now, right?

32:14.557 --> 32:16.935
No, I miss. Like, it's hard for me
to go to ballets.

32:17.018 --> 32:18.186
-To see ballets?
-Yeah.

32:18.269 --> 32:20.647
'Cause you remember--
you know what it feels like to do them.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.398
That's why I said you're
gonna miss <i>Nutcracker.</i>

32:22.482 --> 32:24.317
You're gonna sit in <i>Nutcrack</i>
<i>and I go, "Oh!"</i>

32:24.400 --> 32:28.738
But it-- but it took you a little while
to, like, once you didn't,

32:28.821 --> 32:30.865
you were, like,
"Am I a dancer? What--"

32:30.949 --> 32:32.700
"What am I supposed to be
when I grow up?"

32:32.784 --> 32:35.244
Yeah, what am I supposed
to be when I grow up?

32:35.328 --> 32:36.537
I don't know.

32:36.621 --> 32:37.622
Yeah.

32:45.755 --> 32:48.383
Little Wendy, 12 years old.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.637
In Louisville, Kentucky.

32:54.097 --> 32:59.435
This was a ballet that
my very favorite teacher, Robert Dicello,

32:59.519 --> 33:01.479
choreographed on me when I was 12.

33:02.647 --> 33:05.358
And he said to me,
"You're really, really talented."

33:05.441 --> 33:08.653
And he said, "I thought to myself,
'God, is Wendy a prodigy?'

33:08.736 --> 33:13.574
And I came to the realization
that you are not a prodigy.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.869
And I'm so happy, because when you
finally make it,

33:16.953 --> 33:19.497
you're gonna be so much happier

33:19.580 --> 33:21.749
because you're gonna
have made it on your own.

33:21.833 --> 33:25.461
It will be because you put in
all the work yourself."

33:26.587 --> 33:30.925
And then, when I was, like, 12,
they discovered that I have scoliosis.

33:34.345 --> 33:38.141
And I had to go into traction
and do all this crazy stuff,

33:38.224 --> 33:41.144
um, but my body really responded to that.

33:41.227 --> 33:43.980
I grew an inch and a half in a week.

33:44.063 --> 33:48.776
Um, my doctor told me I needed
to wear a brace for a few years...

33:50.153 --> 33:54.032
and as soon as I got that brace,
I could take class again.

33:55.575 --> 33:58.327
So then I came to New York at 15,

33:58.411 --> 34:01.748
by myself, and went
to the School of American Ballet.

34:02.999 --> 34:06.461
You know, I wasn't necessarily
a beautiful girl

34:06.544 --> 34:08.379
when I got into the company.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.172
Definitely when I got into the company.

34:10.255 --> 34:12.550
I'm beautiful now!

34:12.632 --> 34:17.472
But I didn't know my...
I didn't know beauty in myself.

34:17.554 --> 34:18.764
I knew strength.

34:21.350 --> 34:22.810
As soon as I got into the company,

34:22.893 --> 34:26.063
Peter Martins was bringing in
these contemporary choreographers,

34:26.147 --> 34:30.025
and I really, really enjoyed the process
of working in the room with them...

34:30.860 --> 34:33.612
especially Christopher Wheeldon
and Alexei Ratmansky.

34:35.031 --> 34:38.493
What made you want to work with Wendy
specifically, compared to everyone else?

34:38.576 --> 34:40.661
Well, there was something in, um...

34:40.745 --> 34:43.246
like, I would call it
the proportions on the body

34:43.331 --> 34:44.791
that are so unique.

34:44.873 --> 34:50.213
And then I think there's a connection
between the music and Wendy.

34:50.295 --> 34:52.465
I take the music home a lot
and I listen to it,

34:52.547 --> 34:55.009
-especially after you would give steps.
-You prepare...

34:55.092 --> 34:58.096
You give steps that day,
and-- or Chris does the same thing,

34:58.179 --> 35:01.182
so I play the music at night
and go over the steps,

35:01.265 --> 35:03.601
and I'll maybe come in
with more coloration for you,

35:03.684 --> 35:06.187
-and then you either erase it--
-Right.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.564
...or you build on it, so, yeah.

35:08.648 --> 35:15.113
She's inspired us to make
our, maybe, best things.

35:16.405 --> 35:18.866
<i>When I started to work</i>
<i>with Christopher Wheeldon,</i>

35:18.950 --> 35:21.536
<i>his first piece was</i>
<i>a different kind of piece for him.</i>

35:24.205 --> 35:26.666
<i>Through the process</i>
<i>of creating polyphonia,</i>

35:26.749 --> 35:31.462
<i>Wendy helped me to kind of unlock</i>
<i>a new way of working.</i>

35:31.546 --> 35:36.259
<i>She encouraged me to be</i>
<i>more inventive with my movements.</i>

35:36.342 --> 35:40.888
She encouraged me to be
more creative with my music choices.

35:40.972 --> 35:45.810
<i>She represented something very fresh,</i>
<i>something very modern,</i>

35:45.893 --> 35:51.440
<i>a different type of ballerina,</i>
<i>unlike any that I'd worked with before.</i>

35:59.365 --> 36:01.450
Okay.

36:02.535 --> 36:03.703
Fresh start.

36:06.414 --> 36:07.832
-Okay.
-Yeah?

36:07.915 --> 36:10.126
-We'll use this, okay?
-Okay. Mm-hmm.

36:10.209 --> 36:14.046
So, nice and easy. Start parallel.

36:14.130 --> 36:16.591
-We're just gonna do... First. Okay.
-First.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.134
And port de bras.

36:18.217 --> 36:20.261
One, two, three, four.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.638
Port de bras forward, if you want.

36:25.099 --> 36:26.976
And come up.

36:27.059 --> 36:29.187
Then port de bras up and back.

36:29.270 --> 36:30.396
I'm pretty good.

36:30.479 --> 36:32.690
You're more than pretty good, Wendy.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.611
-Inner thigh good there?
-Yeah. Uh-huh.

36:36.694 --> 36:40.364
Good. Now tendu, and let's not do fifth,
but let's do a third.

36:40.448 --> 36:41.449
Mm-hmm.

36:42.783 --> 36:44.744
-I'm happy with that.
-That's a very good third.

36:44.827 --> 36:47.330
I'll take that. I've done this on stage
when it's supposed to be a fifth.

36:47.413 --> 36:50.708
Well, I think-- I mean, anyway,
moving forward, this is your first barre.

36:50.791 --> 36:54.295
When do you think I might be able to go
into, um, like, Dze's class

36:54.378 --> 36:56.505
or some kind of-- like a--

36:56.589 --> 36:58.049
-Uh...
-In a while? January?

36:58.132 --> 36:59.175
January!

36:59.258 --> 37:01.844
January what?

37:01.928 --> 37:05.014
Like, I'd say four weeks from now.

37:05.097 --> 37:06.682
-For real?
-Mm-hmm.

37:06.766 --> 37:10.186
Fuck, man, I have to rehearse
with Alejandro the first week of February,

37:10.269 --> 37:13.731
-if I can.
-Okay. That's fine.

37:17.818 --> 37:18.819
Okay.

37:28.246 --> 37:32.541
<i>Knowing how much I can work</i>
<i>in the future, in the way I want to work,</i>

37:32.625 --> 37:35.962
<i>is a really... question</i>
<i>left to be answered.</i>

37:36.045 --> 37:39.465
<i>You know, I might have already retired</i>
<i>if it doesn't come back</i>

37:39.548 --> 37:41.175
<i>to where it needs to.</i>

37:41.259 --> 37:43.928
<i>I might have already retired</i>
<i>without knowing it</i>

37:44.011 --> 37:45.638
<i>or planning it.</i>

37:48.391 --> 37:50.977
In some ways,
it feels like it's yesterday

37:51.060 --> 37:53.896
that I retired and stopped performing.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.107
But when you left, you <i>left.</i>
<i>You were gone in, like...</i>

37:56.190 --> 37:58.317
I was gone four days later.

37:58.401 --> 38:00.820
After my retirement show.

38:00.903 --> 38:02.571
I think you feel a well of emotions,

38:02.655 --> 38:05.324
and some of them you can predict
and some of them...

38:05.408 --> 38:07.827
-you can't predict...
-Yeah.

38:07.910 --> 38:10.204
-...some of them don't hit you until...
-Later?

38:10.288 --> 38:11.914
-...much, much later.
-Really?

38:11.998 --> 38:13.374
Mm-hmm.

38:13.457 --> 38:19.297
It's a huge emotional process
of letting go of something

38:19.380 --> 38:21.549
you spent your whole life
trying to achieve.

38:21.632 --> 38:22.800
Yeah.

38:22.883 --> 38:24.677
-It still is to me.
-Yeah.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.846
-My identity's so wrapped up in it.
-Yeah.

38:26.929 --> 38:30.766
Well, in our generation,
in my generation, for a girl,

38:30.850 --> 38:32.643
and going into Balanchine world

38:32.727 --> 38:37.565
it's like, you don't have babies,
you don't have a boyfriend,

38:37.648 --> 38:40.276
you don't get married,
you know what I mean?

38:40.359 --> 38:46.157
I remember thinking as a young start-up,
"No, you can't do that!

38:46.240 --> 38:51.287
I could never do that.
I'm all or nothing."

38:51.370 --> 38:53.164
And that's, like, I chose that route.

38:53.247 --> 38:54.248
Yeah.

38:59.712 --> 39:03.382
<i>I have a few really good friends</i>
<i>leaving the company this year.</i>

39:04.216 --> 39:10.014
<i>For the most part they have a place to go</i>
<i>and count on a job.</i>

39:10.097 --> 39:13.559
<i>They've wanted this kind of job</i>
<i>for themselves, I think.</i>

39:13.642 --> 39:15.686
<i>They've been teaching</i>
<i>or they've been coaching,</i>

39:15.770 --> 39:18.272
<i>and they've positioned</i>
<i>themselves for this.</i>

39:18.356 --> 39:23.611
<i>And I never... saw myself doing</i>
<i>what they're doing.</i>

39:24.987 --> 39:28.491
But, you know, the body's...

39:31.369 --> 39:37.333
a big thing when you want to just keep
doing more of what you've done.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.467
<i>As a young kid, there's so much hope.</i>

39:46.550 --> 39:48.094
<i>You don't see the end.</i>

39:49.929 --> 39:54.475
<i>You think, "Oh, I'm never gonna die.</i>
<i>I'm never gonna, you know, get weak,</i>

39:54.558 --> 39:56.018
<i>I'm never gonna break.</i>

39:56.102 --> 40:00.147
<i>I'm gonna be this, like, strong</i>
<i>blossoming thing forever."</i>

40:01.482 --> 40:03.484
Then reality...

40:03.567 --> 40:09.031
It's like living in a fantasy world
for a long time, like...

40:10.241 --> 40:12.368
most of your life,

40:12.451 --> 40:15.329
and then realizing,
"Well, fantasy's over."

40:15.413 --> 40:17.873
It's, like, really weird, really...

40:17.957 --> 40:20.334
And part of me's embarrassed
'cause it's like,

40:20.418 --> 40:22.795
"Well, grow the fuck up, Wendy!"

40:22.878 --> 40:27.174
You know, you're 46 years old
and you're still dreaming

40:27.258 --> 40:30.094
like you're a teenaged kid.

40:45.734 --> 40:47.027
Straight knee.

40:51.740 --> 40:52.950
-You all right?
-Mm-hmm.

41:02.042 --> 41:05.379
<i>I know that it's unrealistic to think</i>
<i>that I can dance ballet forever,</i>

41:05.463 --> 41:09.800
<i>but maybe it's possible to keep dancing.</i>

41:15.389 --> 41:18.851
-Did you want me taller?
-But that will be okay.

41:21.187 --> 41:24.064
<i>Contemporary dance might</i>
<i>give me that opportunity,</i>

41:24.148 --> 41:27.860
<i>just by letting me focus</i>
<i>on what I can do.</i>

41:35.743 --> 41:38.579
<i>I'd like to really sort of expose</i>
<i>myself a little more</i>

41:38.662 --> 41:42.875
<i>and express myself a little more</i>
<i>in ways that I can't necessarily do</i>

41:42.958 --> 41:44.710
<i>in just the ballet.</i>

41:44.793 --> 41:48.380
<i>I kind of want to open up my--</i>
<i>my-- my world a little bit</i>

41:48.464 --> 41:51.425
<i>and step out,</i>

41:51.509 --> 41:53.844
as scary and uncomfortable as it is,

41:53.928 --> 41:59.767
but just I wanna-- I wanna see
more of what's in me with that, so...

41:59.850 --> 42:03.687
'Cause there's a lot in there.
Just haven't tapped it yet.

42:04.772 --> 42:06.815
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:06.899 --> 42:09.109
Baby-faced Kyle. You shaved!

42:09.193 --> 42:13.030
Yeah, you know, trying to be, like,
you know, your age.

42:13.113 --> 42:15.950
I'm trying to be like your age!

42:16.033 --> 42:17.535
Forget about yours!

42:17.618 --> 42:20.120
Oh, well, you know, took ten years off.

42:20.204 --> 42:23.123
Ten! It's, like, ten, ten, ten.

42:32.550 --> 42:36.595
<i>So I had this idea of working</i>
<i>with contemporary choreographers</i>

42:36.679 --> 42:40.891
<i>that I really love in a project</i>
<i>that I call </i><i>Restless Creature.</i>

42:42.601 --> 42:45.563
After <i>Restless Creature--</i>
<i>you know about that a little bit, right?</i>

42:45.646 --> 42:47.648
-Tell me about it.
-It's what I'm doing right now.

42:47.731 --> 42:49.733
We have the Joyce commissioning us.

42:49.817 --> 42:52.444
-We have Caroline Performing Arts.
-Right.

42:52.528 --> 42:54.446
And, um, we're touring it
all next year.

42:54.530 --> 43:00.452
Okay. It's so important
that you take the next step,

43:00.536 --> 43:05.457
so I would be really keen
to help if we can.

43:05.541 --> 43:09.044
<i>So, is this going</i>
<i>to be the vehicle for you?</i>

43:09.128 --> 43:11.088
<i>This is my first vehicle.</i>

43:11.171 --> 43:12.172
Oh, sorry.

43:14.883 --> 43:16.093
<i>I ended up deciding to work</i>

43:16.176 --> 43:19.263
<i>with four young, male,</i>
<i>contemporary choreographers</i>

43:19.346 --> 43:22.391
<i>because they would all be</i>
<i>so different from myself.</i>

43:22.474 --> 43:24.351
Let this come down the arm.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.645
-Okay.
-You go like that. Yeah.

43:26.729 --> 43:31.442
<i>And I will, luckily, get to dance</i>
<i>with each of them in their own piece.</i>

43:31.525 --> 43:34.320
The only thing
is that one little...

43:34.403 --> 43:36.697
It's okay, it's just...

43:36.780 --> 43:40.200
And one-- Could there maybe be
a different position that we could do?

43:40.284 --> 43:42.119
It might-- I would-- I might like that?

43:42.202 --> 43:43.579
Okay, let's-- let's investigate.

43:43.662 --> 43:44.747
Okay.

43:44.830 --> 43:48.542
<i>Where can they see you</i>
<i>performing </i> Restless Creature <i>on tour?</i>

43:49.793 --> 43:52.671
We go to Boston,
we go to Pittsburgh,

43:52.755 --> 43:54.840
we go to Louisville, Kentucky,

43:54.923 --> 43:57.635
we go to Chicago,

43:57.718 --> 43:59.345
<i>the Joyce, um...</i>

44:00.346 --> 44:02.431
<i>Princeton. Yeah, so...</i>

44:02.514 --> 44:04.183
<i>Look on restlesscreature.com.</i>

44:04.266 --> 44:06.060
<i>It should tell you where we will be.</i>

44:06.143 --> 44:08.437
-Oh, my God!
-Hi, Davidson!

44:08.520 --> 44:10.439
-Hey, boss!
-How's it going?

44:11.649 --> 44:13.984
We have heroin strapped to your back.

44:14.068 --> 44:15.861
I do have, like, a heroin patch.

44:15.944 --> 44:17.404
That's intense. Wow.

44:17.488 --> 44:19.031
-Yeah.
-Is it, like, morphine, or--?

44:19.114 --> 44:20.824
I don't know what it is, but it's working.

44:20.908 --> 44:22.993
-That's awesome. Drugs!
-Yeah.

44:25.412 --> 44:29.458
And really just see if your legs were,
just like, amoeba-like, yeah?

44:30.459 --> 44:31.502
And...

44:32.419 --> 44:36.840
<i>I think about </i> Restless Creature
<i>as opening up dancers' eyes</i>

44:36.924 --> 44:40.427
<i>as to other things you can do</i>
<i>besides ballet,</i>

44:40.511 --> 44:44.056
<i>other things you can do</i>
<i>when ballet's too much for your body.</i>

44:44.139 --> 44:46.934
Don't sweat, or else--!

44:47.017 --> 44:48.310
-Good.
-Okay.

44:48.394 --> 44:50.312
-That's different.
-That was great.

44:50.396 --> 44:53.190
-All right--
-I'll try to retain that.

44:55.943 --> 44:59.863
I think-- I think going forward this way
is pretty good.

44:59.947 --> 45:02.449
- It's when I'm supporting it.
- When you're standing on--?

45:02.533 --> 45:04.368
That, it doesn't... Wow.

45:04.451 --> 45:06.203
-Where's--
-Come up.

45:06.286 --> 45:07.621
It doesn't want to come up?

45:07.704 --> 45:11.708
I can go down,
but the coming up is, like...

45:11.792 --> 45:15.963
It's like, "Uh!"
It doesn't like that move.

45:21.009 --> 45:22.261
You feel stiff?

45:23.345 --> 45:27.474
I mean, I sound like a--
I sound like cement everywhere.

45:27.558 --> 45:29.768
-You don't feel like cement.
-Okay.

45:29.852 --> 45:31.812
-So stand up.
-Oh, God. Okay.

45:33.605 --> 45:35.524
...lately, 'cause this is
a little bit funky, but...

45:35.607 --> 45:37.109
That means you're doing too much.

45:37.192 --> 45:38.902
Okay. I know, I got the message!

45:38.986 --> 45:41.029
Oh, I know, but I'm just telling you
that's what--

45:41.113 --> 45:44.074
when that starts to manifest,
it means you've done too much

45:44.158 --> 45:45.617
-and you've gone too far.
-Okay.

45:45.701 --> 45:47.828
'Cause we need to keep that at bay.

45:48.829 --> 45:49.830
-Right?
-Yeah.

46:03.385 --> 46:09.808
I haven't really spoken to my boss,
Peter Martins, since last April.

46:09.892 --> 46:12.686
And then I got an email yesterday
from his secretary

46:12.769 --> 46:15.189
saying he wanted to speak with me,

46:15.272 --> 46:21.653
and, you know, that's always cause
for me to, like, you know, worry.

46:21.737 --> 46:25.407
I can't predict
what he wants to talk about,

46:25.491 --> 46:29.828
except for my retirement
from New York City Ballet.

46:29.912 --> 46:32.372
So, that's, uh...

46:34.541 --> 46:37.252
not an easy topic for me.

46:46.595 --> 46:49.181
-Sean! How are you?
-Hey, I'm good. How's it going?

46:49.264 --> 46:50.933
You going in? I'm gonna go with you.

46:51.016 --> 46:53.810
-How's it going? Yeah.
-I'm walking!

47:19.378 --> 47:21.922
So I didn't know,
you know, what to expect.

47:22.005 --> 47:23.215
And they called you?

47:23.298 --> 47:25.133
They called me out of the blue,

47:25.217 --> 47:30.514
and he says to me that the board
questions him all the time,

47:30.597 --> 47:32.683
"Where's Wendy? How's Wendy?
What's up with her?"

47:32.766 --> 47:35.143
and he doesn't have an answer for them,
and he's embarrassed

47:35.227 --> 47:37.604
-that he doesn't have an answer.
-That's funny.

47:37.688 --> 47:41.817
Yeah, so he's just like, "I figure
I should start having some answers."

47:41.900 --> 47:44.861
So, did you talk about winter
or spring or anything like that?

47:44.945 --> 47:47.447
Well, he started to talk about, um...

47:47.531 --> 47:48.991
He's like, "You know..."

47:49.074 --> 47:52.077
I told him I didn't think
I would be back before March,

47:52.160 --> 47:54.371
so I was planning on doing the spring,

47:54.454 --> 47:58.875
and then he said, "Well, you know,
I'm getting ready to program '14 and '15."

47:58.959 --> 48:02.754
So I said, "Well, '15," I go,
"I won't be there in '15."

48:02.838 --> 48:06.466
And he was like, "Really. No?"

48:06.550 --> 48:11.555
I said no. I said, "'14 will be 30 years,
and I don't want to go to 31."

48:11.638 --> 48:15.392
Thirty years is good for me.

48:15.475 --> 48:18.520
So, fall of '14.

48:18.604 --> 48:19.521
-Fall?
-Yeah.

48:19.605 --> 48:22.399
Well, that is amazing.
That is much better than...

48:22.482 --> 48:24.318
-I expected.
-Me too.

48:24.401 --> 48:26.778
I thought he was gonna hand you
your walking papers.

48:26.862 --> 48:28.989
Me too.

48:33.410 --> 48:35.579
<i>You know, maybe Peter</i>
<i>kind of planted the seed</i>

48:35.662 --> 48:38.081
<i>to, like, leave it open for me to say it,</i>

48:38.165 --> 48:41.168
<i>and he put that bullseye out for me</i>

48:41.251 --> 48:43.754
<i>and gave me the power to throw the dart,</i>

48:43.837 --> 48:46.882
and I did it, but it was my choice,

48:46.965 --> 48:53.680
and I said it, and I didn't have
to be prompted to give it.

48:54.765 --> 48:59.269
<i>Hopefully tour </i> Restless Creature
<i>in March and April.</i>

48:59.353 --> 49:04.608
<i>In May/June, I'll be on stage</i>
<i>with the New York City Ballet.</i>

49:04.691 --> 49:09.279
<i>And then the fall, little final romp</i>
<i>with the New York City Ballet,</i>

49:09.363 --> 49:12.240
and feel like a strong, good ending

49:12.324 --> 49:15.327
to 30 years there.

49:16.328 --> 49:18.497
- Hello!
- Hi! Come on in, guys!

49:18.580 --> 49:20.832
Hey!

49:20.916 --> 49:22.668
<i>This came out.</i>

49:24.169 --> 49:25.879
Oh, I remember.

49:25.962 --> 49:27.839
Can you get this
at, like, a Barnes &amp; Noble?

49:27.923 --> 49:29.383
Soon. I think it's not quite yet.

49:29.466 --> 49:31.051
Wendy, this is pretty hot.

49:31.134 --> 49:34.805
We went-- we went a little crazy, but...

49:34.888 --> 49:38.266
'Cause a lot of it we talked
about trying to transform myself.

49:38.350 --> 49:42.938
Obviously, they transformed me
in the next photos, so...

49:43.021 --> 49:44.439
-Is this you?
-That's me.

49:44.523 --> 49:46.024
-Oh, my God!
-That's what I mean!

49:46.108 --> 49:48.568
They did all,
like, this transforming stuff.

49:48.652 --> 49:51.405
Yeah, I had big boobs in.
And I literally--

49:51.488 --> 49:53.615
Well, actually, the other photo,
I bent forward,

49:53.699 --> 49:55.492
and they fell on the floor.

49:55.575 --> 49:58.578
It was really, really loud,
and it was really, really funny.

49:58.662 --> 50:01.331
Like, it literally, no, it went "boom"
right on the table.

50:03.208 --> 50:05.877
-The gods were laughing.
-Hey, we don't have to see that in this...

50:05.961 --> 50:08.255
No, just the secret behind this photo.

50:08.338 --> 50:09.464
Yeah.

50:09.548 --> 50:13.051
Oh, my gosh! She's so naughty.

50:15.887 --> 50:20.726
So, we're all here, and we want to hear
what Rob had to say.

50:20.809 --> 50:25.021
<i>He definitely feels pretty adamant</i>
<i>that New York City Ballet</i>

50:25.105 --> 50:27.941
<i>should be announcing you</i>
<i>stepping down.</i>

50:28.024 --> 50:32.320
Okay, so some of the things
that we will mention in our press release

50:32.404 --> 50:35.407
is, you know, this date
is the last performance,

50:35.490 --> 50:37.701
um, program to be announced,

50:37.784 --> 50:41.121
um, and then number two,

50:41.204 --> 50:43.290
Restless Creature <i>is going</i>
<i>on a six-week tour,</i>

50:43.373 --> 50:45.375
<i>these are the cities.</i>

50:45.459 --> 50:48.628
<i>We will need to talk to the cities</i>
<i>and just get approvals.</i>

50:48.712 --> 50:50.756
Hi, everyone!

50:50.839 --> 50:52.883
Welcome! We're actually doing this!

50:57.679 --> 50:59.473
Okay, going up?

50:59.556 --> 51:02.142
Josh's piece looks
really amazing against black.

51:02.225 --> 51:03.226
Mm-hmm.

51:03.310 --> 51:05.520
And I know you wanted black, right?

51:06.897 --> 51:08.774
Yeah. Yeah.

51:08.857 --> 51:10.609
We put it black.

51:10.692 --> 51:11.902
-Oh, I know.
-Why not?

51:11.985 --> 51:13.403
-It looks great.
-Then do it.

51:14.446 --> 51:16.531
This is front light.

51:16.615 --> 51:18.784
Um, and in general I have this--

51:18.867 --> 51:20.702
Is this for, like, Joshua's vision?

51:20.786 --> 51:22.204
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

51:23.246 --> 51:25.999
<i>Going into this new realm</i>
<i>of new choreography</i>

51:26.082 --> 51:28.001
<i>and new artists that I don't know,</i>

51:28.084 --> 51:30.962
<i>um, and having my name on it,</i>

51:31.046 --> 51:33.590
<i>is really scary.</i>

51:33.673 --> 51:35.675
This looks great, Karen.
I love that.

51:35.759 --> 51:38.428
And then look at this--
these will hook on that dress,

51:38.512 --> 51:40.305
and its little things...

51:40.388 --> 51:42.140
Was this for Alejandro?

51:42.224 --> 51:46.728
<i>You know, I have to be in charge,</i>
<i>and that is just new for me.</i>

51:46.812 --> 51:47.938
...the velvety...

51:48.021 --> 51:50.065
<i>I always thought,</i>
<i>"Oh, I'm not ready for that.</i>

51:50.148 --> 51:51.650
<i>I'm still a dancer."</i>

51:51.733 --> 51:53.193
But you were.

51:53.276 --> 51:55.779
Well, I don't know if I'm still--
I don't know if I'm ready.

51:55.862 --> 51:57.239
That's the thing.

51:57.322 --> 52:00.659
But the-- but the beauty
of your particular approach

52:00.742 --> 52:05.163
is that you-- you actually weren't
strategizing all of those things.

52:05.247 --> 52:08.583
<i>You weren't living your life</i>
<i>like a chess board.</i>

52:08.667 --> 52:10.669
<i>You were just dancing.</i>

52:17.384 --> 52:18.677
Okay, two groups.

52:18.760 --> 52:21.137
First group.

52:21.221 --> 52:24.015
Half... Everyone, spread out on the floor,

52:24.099 --> 52:25.809
make sure there's space.

53:00.510 --> 53:02.762
James. James.

53:15.692 --> 53:18.111
Look at you sitting after my class.

53:19.446 --> 53:21.990
I mean, when I was watching
before you knew I was there...

53:22.073 --> 53:24.117
-I was watching you...
-This was irritating.

53:24.200 --> 53:25.952
Okay, so it's hurting you.

53:26.036 --> 53:29.039
I love how you came and pulled the cane
and pulled me out of the class.

53:30.040 --> 53:32.584
And it's so nice to see you,
like, in that element...

53:32.667 --> 53:34.002
-Yeah.
-...where you belong.

53:34.085 --> 53:36.504
-Like, you...
-Well, where I used to belong.

53:36.588 --> 53:37.923
-You do.
-Where I will belong again.

53:38.006 --> 53:39.299
-You do, I mean...
-I hope and pray.

53:39.382 --> 53:42.302
That's the first time I've watched
you in class, and it's beautiful. It is.

53:42.385 --> 53:47.015
But I also appreciated how much force
you're putting through your body.

53:47.098 --> 53:49.017
-Yeah.
-It's a lot.

53:49.100 --> 53:53.021
-And it doesn't mean--
-I'm just-- and that's, like, low for me,

53:53.104 --> 53:57.400
-so, like, I mean, normal?
-It's high. It's beyond high

53:57.484 --> 54:00.070
for any normal person
having had your procedure.

54:00.153 --> 54:01.363
But I used to-- yeah.

54:01.446 --> 54:03.782
I know, but I just did what I--
what I did before.

54:03.865 --> 54:06.076
Is that okay?
Was I supposed to not do that?

54:06.159 --> 54:09.371
Well, we were thinking
of just doing barre with...

54:09.454 --> 54:11.665
-Oh!
-...very early center work, and that's it.

54:11.748 --> 54:12.958
-Oh, okay, I didn't--
-Right?

54:13.041 --> 54:15.335
-I didn't get that.
-So not two hours of class.

54:15.418 --> 54:17.212
I didn't get that full message. Oh.

54:17.295 --> 54:18.630
-Okay.
-So...

54:18.713 --> 54:20.882
I just-- once I start doing
the pirouettes,

54:20.966 --> 54:22.926
I start actually feeling
like I'm moving,

54:23.009 --> 54:24.302
and that feels really good.

54:24.386 --> 54:28.932
Right, but I think it's probably
what feels good to you

54:29.015 --> 54:30.934
in your mind and perception--

54:31.017 --> 54:32.394
My body's not ready for it?

54:32.477 --> 54:34.604
Your hip is fatigued by that point.

54:46.700 --> 54:49.953
<i>I was getting ready</i>
<i>to go to class this morning,</i>

54:50.036 --> 54:54.958
<i>and I hear this crash, like, sound</i>
<i>in my living room,</i>

54:55.041 --> 54:59.045
<i>and I look, and sitting on top</i>
<i>of my air conditioner outside</i>

54:59.129 --> 55:01.464
<i>is this giant hawk.</i>

55:01.548 --> 55:03.216
<i>I've never seen anything like it.</i>

55:04.175 --> 55:05.552
It's kind of like...

55:05.635 --> 55:08.096
"Why'd you come to my window?"

55:09.472 --> 55:11.975
<i>I was told by people</i>
<i>that when a hawk visits you,</i>

55:12.058 --> 55:13.727
<i>it's sort of a message.</i>

55:14.561 --> 55:18.815
<i>After weeks of struggling</i>
<i>with this constantly,</i>

55:18.898 --> 55:22.277
not knowing can I do
what I'm supposed to do or not?

55:22.360 --> 55:23.903
What am I-- What--

55:25.321 --> 55:27.323
What-- what's the answer?

55:27.407 --> 55:29.409
I got the answer,

55:29.492 --> 55:31.870
and I made this decision.

55:31.953 --> 55:37.500
<i>And I called my manager</i>
<i>and just told him, "I can't do it."</i>

55:37.584 --> 55:41.421
<i>I need to focus on getting back</i>
<i>to the ballet.</i>

55:41.504 --> 55:44.549
Dude, you didn't mention anything
to the guys yet, did you?

55:44.632 --> 55:46.342
-No.
-Okay.

55:46.426 --> 55:48.303
What are we looking at, exactly?

55:48.386 --> 55:51.347
My first <i>Restless Creature </i> show
is March 18th,

55:51.431 --> 55:54.934
and I can't even get through
my own class right now.

55:55.018 --> 55:57.062
Right. Mm-hmm.

55:57.145 --> 56:00.315
And every night, I'm limping.

56:00.398 --> 56:03.777
And that's when the show has to happen.

56:03.860 --> 56:06.905
-Nobody wants to see a lame--
-No. No, no, no.

56:06.988 --> 56:09.074
-Absolutely not.
-Old ballerina.

56:09.157 --> 56:11.284
-No, no-- Don't say that.
-Trying to, like...

56:11.367 --> 56:13.036
Mm. Here, they're calling me.

56:13.119 --> 56:14.329
Okay.

56:15.580 --> 56:17.040
- <i>Hello.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

56:17.123 --> 56:18.374
<i>Hi, Wendy.</i>

56:18.458 --> 56:21.086
Hi, Ilter. Hi, Courtney.

56:21.169 --> 56:24.798
I can't see you guys. Is that okay?

56:24.881 --> 56:25.965
<i>That's fine.</i>

56:26.049 --> 56:30.553
<i>Um, it's going to be very tricky</i>
<i>for a lot of reasons...</i>

56:30.637 --> 56:31.638
Yeah?

56:31.721 --> 56:36.643
<i>Um, we feel we should go ahead</i>
<i>and cancel the tour</i>

56:36.726 --> 56:38.770
<i>and offer postponing it.</i>

56:38.853 --> 56:41.189
I'm-- I'm very happy with that.

56:41.272 --> 56:45.985
<i>Hopefully that will help</i>
<i>your mind and body at the same time.</i>

56:46.069 --> 56:48.279
I hope so.

56:48.363 --> 56:50.532
<i>You're gonna feel really good.</i>

56:50.615 --> 56:54.702
This is the last thing I wanted to do,
and I put it off for so long, but...

56:54.786 --> 56:58.498
Um, there was no-- no way out.

56:58.581 --> 56:59.499
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-Thanks.</i>

56:59.582 --> 57:00.917
<i>Well, have a great evening.</i>

57:01.000 --> 57:02.127
All right, you too.

57:02.210 --> 57:03.336
-Bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

57:09.926 --> 57:11.761
Well, that works for me.

57:11.845 --> 57:13.638
That's great. That makes sense.

57:14.764 --> 57:16.391
I got really scared for a second.

57:16.474 --> 57:19.185
-No, no, no, that's the right solution.
-Yeah...

57:19.269 --> 57:21.271
I'm proud of you, honey.

57:22.439 --> 57:24.607
-Thanks, honey.
-Very proud of you.

57:46.921 --> 57:48.465
I guess I have to go now.

57:48.548 --> 57:51.009
It's in the paper.

57:55.555 --> 57:59.350
<i>So, hopefully, if all goes as planned,</i>

57:59.434 --> 58:02.437
<i>I'll be able to perform again</i>
<i>in three weeks,</i>

58:02.520 --> 58:06.274
<i>at the opening night</i>
<i>of New York City Ballet's spring season.</i>

58:09.819 --> 58:11.070
Tyler...

58:13.239 --> 58:14.407
You can't get it to work?

58:14.491 --> 58:17.452
Well, we haven't used
this one since, like...

58:17.535 --> 58:19.078
Well, that's...

58:19.162 --> 58:20.413
Can I ask how this...

58:23.166 --> 58:25.168
I don't remember ever having
to use this machine.

58:30.256 --> 58:33.301
I have a very different hip joint
than I've ever had in my--

58:33.384 --> 58:35.595
-It's like a whole new thing in there!
-That's okay.

58:35.678 --> 58:38.181
-It's like a different car to drive.
-That's totally fine.

58:38.264 --> 58:40.350
I love that.

58:40.433 --> 58:44.020
You might change your mind soon.

58:44.103 --> 58:47.106
No, are you kidding me? Maria has
a new left foot every day she comes in.

58:47.190 --> 58:48.775
Oh, yeah, that's probably true.

58:48.858 --> 58:50.235
Do you want to shut the door?

58:50.318 --> 58:51.319
Yes.

58:54.614 --> 58:56.449
What's all my fault?

58:56.533 --> 58:58.284
We were just talking about you.

59:00.578 --> 59:01.621
So good to see you!

59:01.704 --> 59:03.373
I'm so glad to see you!

59:03.456 --> 59:05.875
What's going on?

59:09.295 --> 59:11.089
You feel good?

59:11.172 --> 59:13.758
Um, I'll talk to you later.

59:38.157 --> 59:43.329
<i>♪ Well, what the fruit it bears ♪</i>

01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:17.947
-Was that fun?
-Um, it was, except--

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:20.283
I couldn't stop smiling.
It's a very serious part,

01:00:20.366 --> 01:00:21.659
and I kept just being like...

01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:23.911
-No, you guys, no--
-Like, "I see you!"

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:27.874
I, uh, after my class I had to get a cab

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:29.709
because I couldn't walk to the subway.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:32.545
I literally could not walk,

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.464
and I almost canceled.

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:40.136
<i>At acupuncture yesterday--</i>
<i>I got up this morning</i>

01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:42.263
<i>and went to class.</i>

01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:45.683
I kind of did some-- our exercises
and stuff on the floor,

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:48.186
just the simple stuff,
like, reaching out and stuff.

01:00:48.269 --> 01:00:52.106
And then I got up and I had the...

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:57.570
And I went over to my coach
and I got dressed,

01:00:57.654 --> 01:01:01.532
and I limped like a crazy person
out of the building,

01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:04.202
like, embarrassed
because I was with people,

01:01:04.285 --> 01:01:07.288
and, like, it was very obvious
that I could barely walk.

01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:11.125
And I got in a cab
and was like, "Take me home."

01:01:17.131 --> 01:01:20.093
<i>When am I gonna know</i>

Good. There you go.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:02.260
Good. Stretch. Good. All right, not bad.

01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:05.930
Tiny bit better.

01:02:06.013 --> 01:02:07.140
Tiny bit. You all right?

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:08.307
Yeah.

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:17.900
Monsieur!

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:19.986
So...

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:24.615
-Now, of course, we won't have that, yeah?
-Right.

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:26.743
And this will all be in.

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:29.287
Yeah, this will all get cut away.

01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:31.247
Can this be a little bit lower?

01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:32.331
Tell me what you think.

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.500
Well, we're trying to keep
it kind of boaty, so...

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:38.838
-Okay.
-But I think if you feel uncomfortable,

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:40.631
it could probably lower half an inch.

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:42.759
If it's okay. If it's not...

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:44.385
-I say okay.
-We have 24 hours.

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:46.679
- Totally doable.
- Yes, of course.

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:47.805
Of course!

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:28.346
Oh...

-Old friends, new friends.

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:31.064

I might've come up with my last show,

like, program, this morning
when I woke up.

01:08:34.234 --> 01:08:36.737
-Did you see it in a dream?
-Was it in your head?

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:40.073
I-- Like, I-- you know how you wake up
with a really clear mind,

01:08:40.157 --> 01:08:41.367
and I just, like, had it.

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:43.285
I woke up, and it was just, like, clear.

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:44.995
I was, like-- Sort of clear.

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:46.330
Are you allowed to share?

01:08:46.412 --> 01:08:49.917
My idea of doing-- I'm having--
maybe something new--

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.419
New piece that would be
just for that night only.

-And they've already said yes.
-Wow!

01:09:00.426 --> 01:09:02.263
So a little...

01:09:02.345 --> 01:09:04.430
You're not being super ambitious

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:07.268
No, no! But, you know, make it, like...

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:08.894
-Beefy night.
-Your night.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.854
-A beefy night.
-A beefy night!

Wendy Whelan's beefy night.

<i>How's your body holding out?</i>

01:09:28.537 --> 01:09:32.710
<i>In, um, April, my internist</i>
<i>said, "You're gonna get an MRI."</i>

01:09:32.792 --> 01:09:34.502
<i>So I went to get the MRI,</i>

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:36.755
and then they said,
"You have compressed nerves,

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:38.256
and you have stenosis,

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:41.594
and you have stenosis
at the L-3, L-4 vertebrae,

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:44.180
which presses on the nerve
that goes into your hip.

01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:46.390
So it's been there the whole time.

01:09:46.473 --> 01:09:49.310
I didn't know that two things
were gonna come together

01:09:49.393 --> 01:09:52.645
and collaborate on this pain!

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:54.398
So, but I found it out,

01:09:54.481 --> 01:09:58.194
which, you know, luckily I did,
and it is getting better.

01:09:58.277 --> 01:10:00.446
-So, are we going this way?
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:02.531
And then take a little left.

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:04.491
But I can't go by this block.

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:07.328
Every time I do,
I think of Janie and Jennie.

01:10:08.662 --> 01:10:10.706
-Oh, yeah, and they're both gone.
-Yes.

01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:14.501
It always seemed like people
retired too early.

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:19.340
I mean, it just seems like both Janie
and Jennie were really dancing fully...

01:10:19.423 --> 01:10:22.301
They weren't dancing enough, though.

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:23.969
-They weren't cast enough.
-No.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:26.847
-Right.
-They were-- they were, you know,

01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:29.808
-feeling that same energy.
-Yeah.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:43.864
-How are you? Good to see you.
-Hi, honey.

01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:47.952
Oh, my God,
you've gained so much weight!

01:10:48.035 --> 01:10:49.995
-I know, it's unbelievable.
-It's scary!

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:52.122
-All the time.
-Scary.

01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:57.086
<i>I've been emailing with Chris</i>
<i>about the new thing,</i>

01:10:57.169 --> 01:11:00.839
and he's under the gun
with <i>American in Paris, </i> as well,

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:05.552
a little bit, so he kind of needs
to know when we can work,

01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:08.973
and I said I don't know
if we can put that on the schedule.

01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:10.140
-Yes, we can.
-We can?

01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:11.225
-Of course.
-Okay.

01:11:11.308 --> 01:11:14.186
Does he have a preference when
at the end of the day?

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.729
I like 5:00 to 7:00.

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:17.564
-Okay.
-Something like that.

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:20.359
Will you be alive between 5:00 and 7:00
between everything else?

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:24.154
-Yeah. Yeah, I will. Yeah.
-Okay.

01:11:24.238 --> 01:11:27.074
-Thirty years.
-Yeah.

01:11:27.157 --> 01:11:28.409
Since you started, pretty much.

01:11:28.492 --> 01:11:34.748
I remember it was...
As it was yesterday, <i>Who Cares. </i> Workshop.

01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:36.250
I remember it was like yesterday.

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:38.168
Oh, yeah? You know what I remember?

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:40.921
I remember Carin saying to me
in rehearsal for <i>Who Cares,</i>

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:43.841
"Which role do you wanna do?"

01:11:43.924 --> 01:11:46.302
And I said,
"I want to do the jumping girl."

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:50.472
And she said, "Well, Peter wants you
to do the turning girl."

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:53.225
I was like, "Why did you ask me, then?"

01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:57.896
-And you did the turning?
-I did the turning girl, yeah.

01:11:58.772 --> 01:12:00.274
So...

01:12:18.792 --> 01:12:20.169
-Here we go. Ready?
-Yeah.

01:12:20.252 --> 01:12:21.295
The first thingy, yeah.

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:33.849
Six, seven...

01:12:33.932 --> 01:12:35.351
Yes.

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:38.729
So...

01:12:38.812 --> 01:12:40.647
That way, yeah.

01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:56.163
Okay, good. Good.

01:12:57.748 --> 01:12:58.916
Possibly...

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:00.918
Um...

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:05.839
So, that motion is interesting,

01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:07.883
and now it looks a little bit like--

01:13:07.966 --> 01:13:10.386
because you're thinking about
having to get her over your shoulder,

01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:12.638
we're losing that natural momentum.

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:16.016
I wonder if some way you could do,
come down off pointe?

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.768
If that does anything interesting.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:24.817
You know what, I don't want to plié
on that-- in that weird position.

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.860
In that-- in which position?

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.446
Wherever it is that happens--

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:30.948
'Cause it hurts, or just 'cause it's--

01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:34.368
Well, it did the first time, and it just
feels weird to come off pointe there.

01:13:34.451 --> 01:13:36.245
-Okay.
-'Cause it's already over.

01:13:36.328 --> 01:13:38.247
-Yeah.
-So to come off, I have to go back.

01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:39.498
Back, yeah.

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:42.209
What if I turn you when you're down there.

01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:46.463
Like, if you came to me
and I let you turn down here,

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:48.424
- and then we came--
- Oh, maybe.

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:50.968
-'Cause I'm, like, walking around--
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:51.051 --> 01:13:52.970
It's a tricky balance
'cause she's off her leg,

01:13:53.053 --> 01:13:54.555
so you're walking around her off the leg.

01:13:54.638 --> 01:13:56.306
What if we maybe, like--

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:58.809
Whoa, that scared the shit out of me.

01:13:59.977 --> 01:14:02.938
Really, truly. I was like, "Wha!"

01:14:04.064 --> 01:14:05.941
Are you gonna do that again?
Just so I know.

01:14:06.024 --> 01:14:07.317
-Not if you don't want to.
-Maybe?

01:14:07.401 --> 01:14:09.403
That's what I was thinking of,
turning the arms...

01:14:09.486 --> 01:14:11.113
It felt not safe at all to me,

01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:14.158
but I do trust you, Tyler,
so we can try it again.

01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:16.535
What if you just turn and-- Sorry.

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:18.912
If you keep this arm--
if that arm stays up,

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:20.789
what if she just stayed
in, like, one arm?

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:22.499
What if I didn't run around?

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:25.294
-Like, what if we just--
-Oh, that's pretty.

01:14:25.377 --> 01:14:27.004
Oh, that's beautiful. Okay, that's it.

01:14:27.087 --> 01:14:28.088
-Sold.
-There it is.

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:30.757
-That's the version. Sold.
-Sold to the man in the plaid shirt.

01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:33.302
And it was, you know,
it was relatively inexpensive.

01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:35.387
I mean, I'd say it was a little expensive,

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.431
'cause there were
a couple of moments there--

01:14:37.514 --> 01:14:38.682
I might need to see a doctor.

01:14:38.765 --> 01:14:41.185
We might need to get her
a doctor's appointment, but...

01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:45.564
I just feel like it's short.

01:14:45.647 --> 01:14:47.149
-This side is short.
-Uh-huh.

01:14:47.232 --> 01:14:50.068
But by doing class,
and, you know, when I do class,

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:52.696
I really try to push this--
open this side up,

01:14:52.779 --> 01:14:55.240
but I'm feeling really tired.

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:56.783
So maybe you need some rest.

01:14:56.867 --> 01:15:01.497
I don't know, I can't really rest
'cause I have to do my thing.

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:15.344
<i>♪ One, two, three ♪</i>

01:15:15.427 --> 01:15:17.971
Correct. Four.

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:21.433
<i>Alexei texted me</i>
<i>last Thursday out of the blue.</i>

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:23.519
<i>I knew he was working on this new piece,</i>

01:15:23.602 --> 01:15:25.437
<i>and for sure I wasn't gonna be in it</i>

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.898
<i>because I'm only here</i>
<i>for a few more weeks!</i>

01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:32.361
But he really, really hoped
I would do it,

01:15:32.444 --> 01:15:37.282
and, um... I was like,
"Oh... is this real?"

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:42.704
And lean away on one,
so it's too soon before you-- yeah.

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:53.257
<i>At 47 to be in a new ballet,</i>
<i>it's pretty awesome.</i>

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:57.844
<i>It was the best thing ever for me,</i>
<i>the best thing ever.</i>

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:29.209
<i>A month or two ago I didn't expect to be</i>
<i>doing the level of work that I'm doing</i>

01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:31.712
<i>to the degree that I'm doing it,</i>

01:16:31.795 --> 01:16:34.840
<i>keeping up</i>
<i>with those 20-year-olds, you know,</i>

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:39.177
<i>in a new work</i>
<i>and by a really difficult choreographer</i>

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:42.556
<i>that makes meaty, difficult steps.</i>

01:16:46.727 --> 01:16:47.769
Lower.

01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:49.021
Look up. Look up.

01:16:49.104 --> 01:16:50.522
And the ladies, look up.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:53.817
<i>Didn't expect to be doing</i>
<i>as well as I am</i>

01:16:53.900 --> 01:17:00.324
<i>and to be thriving and feeling</i>
<i>an active part of the company again...</i>

01:17:02.242 --> 01:17:04.202
<i>just in time for me to say goodbye.</i>

01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:10.167
But now it's like, "Oh, man,
I could do this another season."

01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:13.045
You know, I could.

01:17:24.222 --> 01:17:27.309
Oh, my God! How are you?

01:17:27.392 --> 01:17:28.810
Are you ready for that night?

01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:30.354
-I don't know!
-Yeah?

01:17:30.437 --> 01:17:33.857
I mean, I think of all you guys
and I'm like...

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:35.859
-They did it.
-...how calm you were.

01:17:35.942 --> 01:17:38.320
Yeah, it's calming.
I mean, you just take it in.

01:17:38.403 --> 01:17:41.823
I hope so. Jenny Ringer was just,
like, unbelievable when I watched her.

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:44.076
Are you gonna lay down
on the flowers like Albert?

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:46.370
I love that!
Then you get a little flower bath.

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:49.456
Cut my shoes off and throw 'em out.
I don't know. I don't know.

01:17:49.539 --> 01:17:52.542
I tell people this all the time.
You changed how the profession--

01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:55.212
It's not even the art.
It's who you are as a person.

01:17:55.295 --> 01:17:57.506
You changed how people behave
in this profession.

01:17:57.589 --> 01:17:58.632
-Oh.
-They're gracious.

01:17:58.715 --> 01:17:59.883
They're kind. They're nice.

01:17:59.966 --> 01:18:02.886
Every time you walked into that theater,
you knew everybody's name

01:18:02.969 --> 01:18:04.221
-on the stage crew...
-Yeah.

01:18:04.304 --> 01:18:06.765
...in the costume department,
every dancer.

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:10.185
People didn't do that before.
They just said, "Get out of my way."

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:17.943
...we'll just do one full company,
and then curtain in and go front pop.

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:20.612
I mean, the second time around...

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:23.198
<i>It's just not</i>
<i>a typical thing to do,</i>

01:18:23.281 --> 01:18:25.867
<i>to really pair two</i>
<i>of these great choreographers</i>

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:28.745
<i>that are so extremely different</i>
<i>up in one piece.</i>

01:18:31.873 --> 01:18:33.917
And it's nice to do both sections now,

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.294
the Chris Wheeldon
and the Alexei Ratmansky section,

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:38.505
and see how they talk to each other

01:18:38.588 --> 01:18:40.716
and feel how different
they are from each other.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.468
<i>Neither of them talked the whole time.</i>

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:45.053
<i>Chris, or, like, say-- you know,</i>

01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:47.305
<i>none of them knew</i>
<i>what the other one was doing.</i>

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:57.899
<i>Alexei had played on the first piece</i>
<i>that he ever made on me,</i>

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.110
<i>which was </i> Russian Seasons.

01:19:00.193 --> 01:19:02.779
He took the first steps that we ever
made together nine years ago

01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:05.615
with the last step that he made for me
about two weeks ago,

01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:09.536
and he made with that his piece.

01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:13.123
So, it's like...

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.088
<i>Those two guys in particular,</i>

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:24.426
<i>but, you know, I have relationships</i>
<i>like that with so many dancers.</i>

01:19:26.636 --> 01:19:30.140
<i>That is the thing that really, you know...</i>

01:19:32.517 --> 01:19:34.811
tears at my heart is those relationships,

01:19:34.895 --> 01:19:36.271
and it's like...

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:44.738
there's nothing like those relationships
that you make with the...

01:19:52.037 --> 01:19:55.040
<i>Christopher Wheeldon</i>
<i>brought us all together.</i>

01:19:56.041 --> 01:19:58.001
-That's right.
-One of your first things?

01:19:58.084 --> 01:20:01.087
-Yeah, one of my first things?
-And one of your first things, right?

01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:03.673
You know what I find amazing, though,
now?

01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:09.721
You guys can fix and do anything now.

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:13.266
I'm not--

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:15.519
-We don't believe it.
-I'm not kidding.

01:20:15.602 --> 01:20:20.899
Like... like, you guys are now masters.

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:39.167
I think we're gonna run out
of flowers in here soon.

01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:44.297
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:52.013
Gotta have it.

01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:54.724
I'm a little scared to go into this.

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:55.809
Yeah?

01:20:55.892 --> 01:20:57.602
It's too intense.
I can't take it right now.

01:20:57.686 --> 01:21:00.105
...so I'm gonna start crying.

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:02.232
- Well, then we'll take this away.
- As soon as I--

01:21:02.315 --> 01:21:03.733
No, don't take it. Don't take it from me.

01:21:03.817 --> 01:21:06.570
We just need to take it out because
you don't want to get high before...

01:21:06.653 --> 01:21:07.904
I don't wanna-- Yeah, I do.

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:11.199
Here, I'll...

01:21:13.493 --> 01:21:17.289
I started dancing with him...
nine years ago?

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:20.542
And we first did this in Germany on a gig,

01:21:20.625 --> 01:21:22.627
the first time we ever danced together.

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:26.506
This is really gross, but, um...

01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:28.383
He said, um...

01:21:28.466 --> 01:21:31.678
We were practicing
in front of the Hamburg Ballet.

01:21:31.761 --> 01:21:34.097
We were on the stage,
everybody's watching us,

01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:35.599
and he's, like, fudging with me.

01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:38.101
I'm like, "Dude, make it smooth.

01:21:38.184 --> 01:21:40.896
Figure out how to fix this.
Make it smooth. Don't bump me."

01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:41.980
Yeah, right.

01:21:42.063 --> 01:21:44.608
So the first thing, he's like,
"I'm trying, I'm really trying."

01:21:44.691 --> 01:21:47.402
I go, "You've gotta just, you know,
I don't know what it takes, but--"

01:21:47.485 --> 01:21:51.239
He's like, "My thumbs are in your armpit,
and I really don't want to hurt you."

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:54.826
I go, "You can stick your thumbs
up my asshole. I don't care.

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:57.078
Just make it smooth."

01:21:57.162 --> 01:21:58.914
And he goes...

01:22:00.498 --> 01:22:03.877
And then we finished.
The show went great.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:08.340
And I said to him, "Did I actually just--
Did I say that to you?"

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:09.633
Three minutes.
