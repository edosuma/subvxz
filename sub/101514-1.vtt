00:39.575 --> 00:42.842
It was a long
one today, I'll tell you that.

00:43.575 --> 00:44.508
Mm.

00:45.375 --> 00:46.842
There's cake in the break room.

00:47.909 --> 00:49.408
Somebody's birthday,
I don't remember who.

00:49.508 --> 00:50.909
It's just one of them
sheet cakes from Kroger,

00:51.009 --> 00:53.276
but, it's pretty good
for a grocery store cake.

00:55.876 --> 00:58.042
You don't really look like
you eat cake, though, do you?

00:58.642 --> 01:00.775
- I eat cake.
- Mm.

01:01.243 --> 01:04.876
You know, my mama always said,
"Never trust a skinny woman.

01:05.009 --> 01:07.076
While we're eating,
they're plotting."

01:08.542 --> 01:10.343
Well, if you eat cake,
how do you stay so little?

01:10.475 --> 01:12.575
You are skin and bones, girl.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.276
Smoking?

01:16.876 --> 01:19.976
Mm-mm, smoking
don't make you thin. I smoke.

01:23.842 --> 01:26.276
You know, I never know
if someone being quiet

01:26.408 --> 01:28.609
is a sign of ain't got
nothing to say,

01:28.742 --> 01:31.375
or they ain't got
nothing going on up here.

01:34.042 --> 01:35.475
You seem to have it
altogether, though.

01:35.609 --> 01:38.343
- Money-wise, I mean.
- How do you know that?

01:39.076 --> 01:41.442
'Cause you come in here
wearing some nice shoes.

01:41.742 --> 01:43.276
I've seen you wearing
those Candies.

01:43.408 --> 01:44.575
Those aren't cheap.

01:46.809 --> 01:48.142
Well.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.076
Have a good shift, Mandy.

01:54.343 --> 01:55.542
Hey, Cathy.

01:56.243 --> 01:57.142
Yeah?

01:57.809 --> 01:58.842
Go fuck yourself.

02:16.176 --> 02:18.675
<i>Oh, you're here.</i>

02:19.109 --> 02:20.709
Okay, I'm very dizzy, okay?

02:20.809 --> 02:22.508
And I spoke to Karen,
she's not listening to me.

02:22.609 --> 02:24.109
I need to talk to a doctor
right away.

02:24.243 --> 02:25.775
What if I fall down
and break a hip?

02:25.909 --> 02:27.642
What if I fall down
and I crack my head

02:27.775 --> 02:30.343
- and get a staph infection?
- Did you check in at this desk?

02:30.442 --> 02:31.343
Yes.

02:31.475 --> 02:32.909
- Mr. Kent...
- Karen.

02:33.209 --> 02:37.176
I told you we will call you
when we have a bed ready.

02:37.408 --> 02:38.876
You need to sit down.

02:40.142 --> 02:42.209
You know, it is hot in here,
so I'm gonna wait outside

02:42.309 --> 02:45.009
until you're ready.
And it better not rain.

02:47.276 --> 02:48.742
I don't like to be wet.

02:52.375 --> 02:53.309
You starting now?

02:53.809 --> 02:55.343
You should know,
you scheduled me.

02:55.475 --> 02:58.109
- Oh, yes.
- I'm about to work a double.

02:59.408 --> 03:01.575
Well, you may wanna
start with 202.

03:02.575 --> 03:04.475
And you should probably go
and get a soda.

03:04.742 --> 03:07.876
I don't drink soda.
Karen, you know that.

03:08.475 --> 03:09.809
You got about 30 minutes.

04:01.842 --> 04:05.909
Chug it, chug it, chug.

04:28.475 --> 04:30.343
This is good to go.

04:31.076 --> 04:35.508
Can you believe our insides
look like this?

04:36.243 --> 04:37.976
Like, that's our guts.

04:38.609 --> 04:40.909
Seems to me like it would
all just come

04:41.042 --> 04:42.842
bubbling out of us sometimes.

04:42.976 --> 04:46.876
Like, "Oops, my pancreas
just fell out."

04:47.276 --> 04:48.375
Regina.

04:50.209 --> 04:52.176
- Hmm?
- Give me the money.

04:52.309 --> 04:54.976
Okay, but first, uh...

04:55.675 --> 04:58.909
let me show you something.
This is what I like to do.

05:03.542 --> 05:08.176
I like to use the soda
to keep 'em extra cold in here.

05:09.142 --> 05:13.042
I always say, "Keeping it cool
is the key to my job."

05:13.176 --> 05:14.142
I made that up.

05:14.276 --> 05:16.343
And then I can drink 'em
when I'm done,

05:16.475 --> 05:17.909
like it's a celebration.

05:18.076 --> 05:22.209
- I really don't care, Regina.
- Look, we're family, right?

05:22.976 --> 05:25.675
I mean, how many cousins
your age you got?

05:25.809 --> 05:27.842
- Cousins by marriage.
- Right.

05:27.976 --> 05:29.809
And who knew we're into
the same stuff?

05:29.942 --> 05:32.042
You know,
the blood and organs and...

05:32.209 --> 05:34.642
We're not. The money, Regina.

05:34.775 --> 05:38.042
'Cause Nicholas needs
a kidney, like, right now.

05:38.243 --> 05:39.742
But I got held up.

05:40.343 --> 05:41.276
You know Wayne?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.809
He... he needed help
with his science homework.

05:44.442 --> 05:46.609
You know they teach
evolution in fifth grade now?

05:46.809 --> 05:49.642
- In public school?
- Regina!

05:50.976 --> 05:53.109
Ah. Sorry.

05:53.375 --> 05:55.709
Now, was there a kidney,
in that sack?

05:55.942 --> 05:56.876
Was there?

05:57.709 --> 05:59.309
I know what a damn kidney
looks like.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.375
Like a bean? Kidney bean?

06:03.076 --> 06:05.442
Jesus. Grumpy ass bitch.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.009
Hey, bitch!

06:26.408 --> 06:28.609
Fuck your mom, asshole.

06:59.076 --> 07:00.076
Are you my mother's nurse?

07:00.642 --> 07:03.842
Was it you who told me that
she was possibly in a coma?

07:05.109 --> 07:06.375
Were you here earlier?

07:07.042 --> 07:08.408
I just got here.

07:09.609 --> 07:10.309
Okay.

07:10.775 --> 07:13.475
Any idea when the results
will be back from her tests?

07:13.742 --> 07:15.942
The doctor won't be back
until tomorrow

07:16.076 --> 07:19.775
- to go over test results.
- But are the test results here?

07:20.309 --> 07:23.575
I... don't see them here, ma'am.

07:24.042 --> 07:26.109
So am I just supposed
to stay here all night?

07:30.009 --> 07:30.842
You don't have to.

07:31.076 --> 07:34.508
I'm sorry.
It's just have a baby at home.

07:35.575 --> 07:37.809
And I help run my...
my husband's business.

07:37.942 --> 07:40.675
You know the... the Catfish King
over on South Grand?

07:40.842 --> 07:41.575
Mm-hmm.

07:41.742 --> 07:43.309
It's just I feel so guilty
not staying

07:43.442 --> 07:45.343
in case she wakes up.
She might be confused.

07:45.475 --> 07:47.775
She's got dementia
or Alzheimer's

07:47.909 --> 07:49.842
or whatever they're calling it
these days.

07:49.909 --> 07:51.575
If she doesn't know
where she is, she can be...

07:51.809 --> 07:53.475
she can be real difficult
and she's...

07:53.675 --> 07:55.343
she's very strong and...

07:55.475 --> 07:57.842
Is that your mother's
overnight bag?

07:58.176 --> 07:59.609
Some of her personal things.

08:00.209 --> 08:01.909
I grabbed real quickly.

08:02.842 --> 08:07.475
You know, I just love
that Catfish King.

08:08.375 --> 08:10.909
Mm! I love those hush puppies.

08:12.775 --> 08:14.742
- Still pretty good.
- Mm-hmm.

08:15.009 --> 08:15.876
But don't you worry,

08:16.076 --> 08:18.109
the good Lord will be
with your mama all night.

08:18.475 --> 08:19.876
Promise you that.

08:37.609 --> 08:38.508
No.

08:51.742 --> 08:53.442
Ain't no way you're waking up.

08:55.408 --> 08:57.042
Room 218 needs cleaning.

08:57.343 --> 08:58.542
I already cleaned it.

08:58.842 --> 08:59.775
He pissed the bed.

08:59.976 --> 09:03.276
He urinated a moment ago.
That's why I cleaned it.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.809
Dorothy, clean the sheets.

09:21.243 --> 09:23.375
- What is that about?
- State Pen.

09:23.542 --> 09:25.408
Tried to kill himself.
He'll make it, though.

09:25.609 --> 09:26.709
Poor thing.

09:27.309 --> 09:28.609
They gotta leave him
handcuffed to the bed

09:28.742 --> 09:29.742
even though he's passed out?

09:29.976 --> 09:32.408
He murdered someone.
Don't you read the paper?

09:35.508 --> 09:36.508
She only reads the Bible.

09:36.775 --> 09:38.408
And those Good News bulletins
that folks leave

09:38.542 --> 09:40.475
on your front porch
when you don't answer the door.

09:42.343 --> 09:43.309
Okay.

09:43.442 --> 09:45.809
Emergency dialysis.
67-year-old male.

09:45.942 --> 09:47.976
Three times in a month.
That's you.

09:48.343 --> 09:49.442
Mr. Collins?

09:49.609 --> 09:52.442
Yep, but not critical,
so just prioritize.

09:55.876 --> 09:57.243
<i>I don't like this room.</i>

09:57.809 --> 09:59.375
You hear me?

10:00.009 --> 10:00.976
I said I don't like it.

10:01.176 --> 10:04.109
You can leave when you're done
with your dialysis.

10:04.876 --> 10:08.475
Sad sweat.
That's what it smells like.

10:11.508 --> 10:13.042
You ever smelled sadness?

10:14.142 --> 10:17.442
Only every day.

10:18.976 --> 10:21.542
You know, they only gave me
three months.

10:21.775 --> 10:24.642
Two and a half now, maybe.

10:25.276 --> 10:28.842
I'm here half the damn time.
I do wanna go home, though.

10:31.076 --> 10:32.408
You turn on that TV?

10:34.176 --> 10:35.109
Sure.

10:37.508 --> 10:39.109
<i>My husband likes a clean car,</i>

10:39.243 --> 10:40.343
<i>what can I say?</i>

10:40.542 --> 10:42.276
<i>Well, you know what they say</i>

10:42.408 --> 10:44.775
<i>about Arkansas,
if you don't like the weather,</i>

10:45.076 --> 10:45.842
<i>just wait a minute.</i>

10:45.976 --> 10:47.809
<i>My grandma did always say that.</i>

10:47.909 --> 10:49.209
<i>Mine too.</i>

10:49.343 --> 10:51.375
<i>Well, thanks
for the weather update, Wendy.</i>

10:51.475 --> 10:54.042
<i>Let's get back to the real news
of this evening.</i>

10:54.442 --> 10:56.343
<i>The local Eighth Grade
Science Fair.</i>

10:56.475 --> 10:57.842
<i>Now, these kids show
some real aptitude.</i>

10:57.976 --> 11:00.442
You know...

11:01.609 --> 11:05.375
...sad thing about dying is that
the minutes really slow down.

11:06.042 --> 11:08.442
You forgot to appreciate
all those other minutes

11:08.575 --> 11:11.508
and all you got are these
shitty ones.

11:14.209 --> 11:16.675
Hey, Mandy, they're bringing in
an OD, and I'm too busy.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.309
They could use some extra hands.

11:24.009 --> 11:24.942
Shit.

11:36.942 --> 11:39.609
Hey, male, 30s.
OD'd, no identification.

11:39.775 --> 11:41.542
Found at a motel.
Heart rate is 38.

11:41.675 --> 11:43.976
Respiratory rate, critical.
Administered Narcan.

11:45.276 --> 11:46.176
What?

11:46.809 --> 11:48.842
- Nothing.
- You know him?

11:49.009 --> 11:50.508
Uh. Sort of.

11:50.675 --> 11:52.142
Okay. He needs his whole
system flushed.

11:52.309 --> 11:53.442
Okay.

11:54.142 --> 11:56.009
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.609
Oh, shit, he's having a seizure.

11:59.575 --> 12:01.575
Code blue,
someone get a line set up.

12:01.709 --> 12:03.642
Oxygen's going down, code blue.

12:32.309 --> 12:33.408
You're late.

12:39.176 --> 12:42.009
But there's nothing I like
better than cash in my hand.

12:42.343 --> 12:46.542
There's a few things I like
a lot more than cash in my hand.

12:47.309 --> 12:48.508
Me too, actually.

12:49.343 --> 12:50.542
Or maybe not.

12:53.542 --> 12:55.176
202 is too tricky.

12:55.709 --> 12:58.976
I have another idea.
Mr. Collins. Dialysis.

13:00.109 --> 13:02.076
Just gotta keep
prying eyes away.

13:02.675 --> 13:05.076
Well, look at you
taking initiative.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.575
I like my initiative too.

13:08.675 --> 13:10.609
Well, I guess I could have
your crazy ass cousin

13:10.742 --> 13:12.109
do another pickup tomorrow.

13:12.508 --> 13:15.508
That girl is not my cousin.

13:17.675 --> 13:19.109
You better tell her that.

15:14.842 --> 15:16.775
Regina, where the fuck
have you been?

15:16.942 --> 15:19.475
Geez, Nick,
I told you I was running late.

15:19.976 --> 15:21.976
I reckoned you guys
would be in here playing poker

15:22.142 --> 15:24.475
- or whatever you do.
- Nah, I already won.

15:24.709 --> 15:26.876
Yeah, that shit ended hours ago.
You...

15:27.542 --> 15:30.709
- kept me waiting.
- Geez, sorry.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.009
I came right here.

15:33.508 --> 15:35.009
- Our cousin said...
- Our cousin?

15:35.343 --> 15:39.076
No, no, you're my cousin.
She's your cousin.

15:39.209 --> 15:41.109
And she's your cousin
by marriage.

15:41.375 --> 15:45.343
Mm-hmm. And that makes her
your cousin too.

15:45.508 --> 15:47.142
Regina,
that's not how family works.

15:49.142 --> 15:50.375
What's happening to her?

15:50.508 --> 15:52.209
She's getting her
belly button pierced.

15:52.309 --> 15:53.609
Stop moving, it'll hurt less.

15:53.876 --> 15:55.508
Uh. Mikey,
get her a drink, okay?

15:55.642 --> 15:57.243
It don't look like
she likes it much.

15:57.408 --> 15:59.408
And how is that any
of your fucking business?

16:00.343 --> 16:02.742
Mandy said one of those things
is a kidney.

16:02.976 --> 16:04.942
"One of those things"?
You don't recognize a kidney?

16:05.076 --> 16:07.475
Telling you, public school here
is a lot of...

16:09.276 --> 16:10.775
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh.

16:11.408 --> 16:13.876
I use those to keep it
a little bit cooler.

16:14.076 --> 16:15.243
You know, I always say,

16:15.542 --> 16:17.842
"Part of my job
is to keep things cool."

16:17.976 --> 16:20.009
That's sweet,
but where are my fucking organs?

16:20.343 --> 16:22.375
Uh. Under the drinks.

16:22.508 --> 16:24.042
No, no, there's nothing here.

16:26.076 --> 16:28.742
- Is this a fucking joke?
- No, no joke.

16:28.876 --> 16:31.809
Uh. I... I don't know.
Let me check my car.

16:31.942 --> 16:34.276
Regina, I...
I realize you're new here.

16:34.375 --> 16:35.942
You've been with us,
what, a couple of weeks?

16:36.076 --> 16:37.176
- A month.
- Okay.

16:37.309 --> 16:39.276
But your sole purpose
is to bring me

16:39.408 --> 16:40.876
the fucking organs.

16:41.076 --> 16:42.375
I'm sure I left them in my car.

16:42.508 --> 16:44.976
I need the fucking organs
right fucking now!

16:45.475 --> 16:48.076
I've got a guy who needs
an organ tonight.

16:48.343 --> 16:50.076
An important guy,
more important than...

16:50.408 --> 16:51.675
than my cousin.

16:52.009 --> 16:53.009
You had one job to do

16:53.142 --> 16:55.609
and that was to bring me
the kidney from the hospital.

16:55.742 --> 16:57.809
It's really...
it's really very simple.

16:58.076 --> 16:58.775
I know.

16:59.009 --> 17:00.408
This is an emergency, Regina.

17:00.609 --> 17:02.042
Shut up!

17:04.442 --> 17:06.475
- I... I'll check my car.
- You do that.

17:06.909 --> 17:08.775
And if it ain't out there,
I can think of another place

17:08.909 --> 17:11.243
where we can find ourselves
a kidney.

17:13.243 --> 17:14.842
Maybe that's
what you're good for.

17:15.475 --> 17:18.375
- Parts.
- I... I'll check my car.

17:25.809 --> 17:28.508
- Somebody get this.
- Somebody come get this.

17:35.408 --> 17:37.408
Shit. Shit.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.842
It's at the hospital.
I'll be right back.

18:00.909 --> 18:02.542
It takes 30 minutes
to get there.

18:03.109 --> 18:06.675
She's not back in an hour,
drag her back by the hair.

18:08.042 --> 18:08.976
Can do.

18:24.775 --> 18:28.042
Hey, will you turn it up?
I wanna know if it's gonna rain.

18:30.675 --> 18:31.575
You deaf?

18:34.742 --> 18:36.642
You know, it's Karen's birthday
next week.

18:37.109 --> 18:38.276
You gonna pitch in for flowers?

18:38.408 --> 18:39.508
We're all chipping
in three bucks.

18:39.775 --> 18:42.508
- Probably not.
- Everybody's doing it.

18:44.575 --> 18:46.142
When are you done
with your probation?

18:47.942 --> 18:48.842
Bite me.

18:51.575 --> 18:54.575
Hey, EMT Derrick said you knew
that trash OD downstairs.

18:54.709 --> 18:55.876
Who is he?

18:59.642 --> 19:00.575
Bitch.

19:03.842 --> 19:05.475
<i>Hoppity the Bunny
is what his name is,</i>

19:05.675 --> 19:08.442
<i>and that Beanie Baby sold
for over 500 dollars</i>

19:08.575 --> 19:09.475
<i>right here in town.</i>

19:09.775 --> 19:11.309
<i>Wow, better stock up on those.</i>

19:11.542 --> 19:13.343
<i>Our top story this evening
is the police force</i>

19:13.508 --> 19:15.375
<i>Y2K Preparation Convention.</i>

19:15.575 --> 19:17.343
<i>Looks like our whole force
is out there.</i>

19:17.508 --> 19:18.642
<i>That and then some.</i>

19:18.809 --> 19:20.709
<i>Tonight began the first night
of a three...</i>

19:24.976 --> 19:28.909
Don't tell the next shift yet.
Maybe not Mr. Collins.

19:29.508 --> 19:32.842
I like him.
I wanna think of someone else.

19:33.442 --> 19:36.675
- What about that prisoner?
- He has a guard.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.842
I ain't scared of that.

19:41.209 --> 19:43.042
Well, he is gonna get the chair.

19:46.508 --> 19:47.942
I guess that could work.

19:49.475 --> 19:51.809
- It your birthday next week?
- Yeah.

19:53.276 --> 19:54.775
They getting me
some flowers or some shit?

19:55.176 --> 19:57.542
- Yeah.
- That's depressing.

19:59.609 --> 20:00.508
Okay.

20:18.775 --> 20:21.475
- Ma'am.
- Just checking in.

20:24.142 --> 20:27.475
- You here all night?
- Uh. Unfortunately so, ma'am.

20:32.408 --> 20:34.942
How's he doing?

20:35.542 --> 20:37.909
- You're the expert.
- Hmm.

20:38.976 --> 20:40.609
Do you need anything?

20:42.842 --> 20:45.642
- I could use a coffee.
- You know, I'm not allowed

20:45.709 --> 20:46.842
to do that for you.

20:47.176 --> 20:49.709
But I could watch him
for a while if you wanna go

20:49.809 --> 20:50.909
grab one. Go on.

20:51.142 --> 20:53.076
They don't... they don't want me
to leave his side.

20:53.309 --> 20:57.042
Oh, he is not going anywhere.

20:57.343 --> 20:59.109
Yeah.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.675
Thanks, but, rules are rules.

21:07.243 --> 21:10.809
Get me some goddamn drugs.

21:15.976 --> 21:17.709
I'll see if I can get you
that coffee.

21:30.942 --> 21:33.609
How you feeling today?

21:43.142 --> 21:44.842
- Did you find that coffee?
- Nope.

21:55.976 --> 21:59.775
We made a mistake.

22:00.809 --> 22:02.375
What the fuck
are you doing here?

22:02.575 --> 22:05.675
- Whoa, is that Andrew?
- What mistake?

22:05.976 --> 22:06.976
He OD?

22:07.475 --> 22:08.976
What's it about this family
that makes you guys

22:09.109 --> 22:12.809
all into junkies, huh?
Must be your daddy or something.

22:18.243 --> 22:19.343
Is Andrew gonna die?

22:19.475 --> 22:21.276
- I never liked...
- There is a reason

22:21.408 --> 22:24.209
we meet down
by the soda machine, Regina.

22:24.475 --> 22:25.475
You can't be seen here.

22:25.675 --> 22:27.343
I didn't want
to come in here, okay?

22:27.542 --> 22:29.709
You know, surrounded
by all these dying people.

22:30.309 --> 22:33.742
This is how you get one of those
flesh-eating bacteria diseases

22:33.876 --> 22:34.809
like they got on TV.

22:35.142 --> 22:37.408
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, you think it's an itch?

22:37.709 --> 22:39.508
And...
and then you scratch it...

22:40.176 --> 22:42.142
and your whole face
comes right off.

22:42.709 --> 22:44.675
And it always begins
in a hospital.

22:44.876 --> 22:48.142
- Why are you here?
- We fucked up.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.842
- Shit.
- Told you that it wasn't here.

22:52.176 --> 22:53.375
Well, where the hell is it?

22:53.508 --> 22:54.809
I don't know.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.176
I don't know,
I... I don't know. I... I...

22:57.343 --> 22:58.976
Maybe you lost it
on the way there.

22:59.109 --> 23:01.775
I didn't touch the cooler
between here and the warehouse.

23:02.009 --> 23:04.609
I checked my car.
I checked everywhere.

23:04.742 --> 23:08.642
Look, if it's not here,
there is nothing I can do.

23:09.209 --> 23:10.942
- We are laying low.
- Look...

23:11.675 --> 23:12.942
I'm a little bit desperate here.

23:13.109 --> 23:16.375
Nicholas is gonna have my ass
if I don't bring him a kidney.

23:16.809 --> 23:19.809
Maybe more than my ass. He...
he is gonna take my kidney.

23:20.076 --> 23:23.375
He said so. How many...
how many do I need to live?

23:23.642 --> 23:26.243
- One.
- How many was I born with?

23:26.475 --> 23:28.842
- Two.
- That's not too bad.

23:29.176 --> 23:30.642
Look... Mm-mm.

23:34.243 --> 23:35.775
I don't wanna point
fingers at you.

23:35.909 --> 23:38.976
It's your job to make sure
I get the package securely.

23:39.109 --> 23:41.909
And apparently, I didn't.
Just help me out.

23:42.042 --> 23:42.742
Regina.

23:42.942 --> 23:44.842
Why, just explain it to me.

23:44.976 --> 23:48.609
- How do you murder people?
- I don't murder them.

23:48.876 --> 23:50.775
It's killing someone.

23:50.909 --> 23:53.508
That's murder,
whatever you do to them.

23:53.575 --> 23:55.542
I don't know what you do,
but how... how do you do it?

23:55.675 --> 23:58.742
- Mandy, just tell me. Come on.
- Bleach.

23:59.475 --> 24:03.642
- I use bleach.
- Hmm. And then you wait?

24:03.842 --> 24:07.142
Someone else does the removals
on the next shift.

24:07.442 --> 24:08.675
I don't even know who.

24:08.809 --> 24:10.742
Maybe you know
how to do it right.

24:12.343 --> 24:14.909
You went to school, you know...
you know what thing sits where,

24:15.042 --> 24:17.609
- whatever it sits in there.
- Yes, I know how to do it.

24:17.876 --> 24:20.109
So you could do it all,
you could do it real fast.

24:20.742 --> 24:24.842
- Like, all in one night.
- No. It's too hard.

24:25.442 --> 24:28.343
- Uh-huh.
- Mandy, help me, please?

24:28.475 --> 24:29.775
I'm fucked.

24:30.109 --> 24:33.609
Regina, you lost thousands
of dollars worth of organs.

24:34.009 --> 24:37.475
- What about Andrew?
- What about Andrew?

24:37.775 --> 24:40.675
I mean, is he gonna
make it outta here alive?

24:41.243 --> 24:42.742
- Yeah.
- Really?

24:43.042 --> 24:44.142
He didn't look too good.

24:45.842 --> 24:48.508
You never really liked him,
right?

24:49.176 --> 24:52.675
I... I know he's family too,
but...

24:53.375 --> 24:54.976
not like you and me.

24:55.343 --> 24:57.109
I never did like him

24:57.442 --> 24:59.942
when it all came out
that he did that...

25:00.508 --> 25:03.343
that awful stuff
to you when you was kids...

25:03.508 --> 25:04.809
Shut it.

25:05.609 --> 25:09.876
Don't you dare go in that room.
Get the fuck out of here.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.442
Do you understand me?

25:14.742 --> 25:17.442
You are gonna have to solve
this problem by yourself.

25:17.575 --> 25:19.142
Yes.

25:19.276 --> 25:21.475
Mandy?

25:22.042 --> 25:25.243
Is it 'cause I said
all that stuff, about Andrew...

25:25.842 --> 25:27.876
about your fucked up childhood?

26:17.309 --> 26:19.775
Well, look at you.

26:21.809 --> 26:22.842
Mm-hmm.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.542
How dead are you?

26:48.942 --> 26:50.575
<i>This is Wendy with the weather.</i>

26:50.909 --> 26:53.508
<i>That big storm looks like
it's coming in tonight.</i>

26:53.742 --> 26:55.942
<i>Straight from the north
and hitting us right here</i>

26:56.076 --> 26:59.976
<i>in Northeast Arkansas,
and it is gonna be a wet one.</i>

27:00.375 --> 27:02.142
<i>Tune in here
for flash flood warnings.</i>

27:02.209 --> 27:03.142
<i>Remember the basics.</i>

27:03.408 --> 27:05.475
- Close the windows to your car?
- Why?

27:06.375 --> 27:07.475
It's gonna rain.

27:08.508 --> 27:10.909
I don't leave the windows
to my car open.

27:11.109 --> 27:12.276
Then they're closed.

27:12.876 --> 27:15.209
<i>High humidity of 87 today.</i>

27:15.343 --> 27:16.809
Get that package out all right?

27:18.176 --> 27:19.375
Yep.

27:20.276 --> 27:22.642
And the other?

27:23.243 --> 27:24.609
I'll keep you updated.

27:25.042 --> 27:27.575
<i>Next week,
we got another hot one for you.</i>

27:28.243 --> 27:31.176
- This is a nasty ass cake.
- Yeah.

27:31.475 --> 27:32.809
They always get...

27:33.909 --> 27:34.942
gross cake.

27:35.642 --> 27:37.575
<i>Stay tuned</i>
<i>next for</i> American Life.

27:50.609 --> 27:51.542
Oh.

27:52.142 --> 27:53.375
Thank you.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.675
Guess I fell asleep.

28:00.976 --> 28:03.442
It's easy to get
tired on these night shifts.

28:03.742 --> 28:04.709
Mm.

28:09.642 --> 28:14.042
- You, uh, work for the prison?
- Nah, I'm just hired security.

28:14.775 --> 28:16.042
They don't even give me a gun.

28:18.243 --> 28:19.209
I mean, not that...

28:19.675 --> 28:21.076
not that I need one.

28:26.009 --> 28:27.009
I do parties.

28:28.742 --> 28:31.542
And nightclubs too.
And sometimes, I do the...

28:31.942 --> 28:34.309
do the show circuit,
the stadium shows.

28:34.609 --> 28:35.942
I just did a Marilyn Manson...

28:36.942 --> 28:38.076
show. Do you like them?

28:38.675 --> 28:41.842
- Mm. No.
- No, yeah. Just a bunch of...

28:43.176 --> 28:44.609
long-haired
vampire-looking kids,

28:44.742 --> 28:46.209
but it was... it was cool.

28:46.876 --> 28:49.475
Yeah, that guitarist used to be
on <i>The Wonder Years.</i>

28:49.775 --> 28:51.276
Yeah, he got one of his ribs
taken out

28:51.408 --> 28:54.675
so he could suck his own dick.
Yeah.

28:55.675 --> 28:56.675
Uh...

29:02.276 --> 29:03.176
Hey.

29:03.775 --> 29:05.909
- Hi!
- You here for his blood work?

29:06.042 --> 29:07.142
Uh-huh, yep, mm-hmm.

29:07.309 --> 29:08.508
He's probably gonna be
a vegetable.

29:08.742 --> 29:10.475
It's a waste, he's pretty cute.

29:10.642 --> 29:12.675
Maybe he's an asshole
in real life.

29:13.076 --> 29:14.176
Cute ones always are.

29:14.942 --> 29:17.809
Excuse me.
Could you direct me to room 222?

29:17.942 --> 29:18.942
I keep getting lost.

29:21.909 --> 29:23.142
I'm busy.

29:23.742 --> 29:27.109
- It's just around the corner.
- Well, I can't seem to find it.

29:28.276 --> 29:29.442
Then I guess...

29:30.176 --> 29:31.408
I'll show you.

29:32.076 --> 29:33.076
You will.

29:40.876 --> 29:43.009
Just keep going.
It's on this floor.

29:48.809 --> 29:52.276
- You are not very helpful.
- I'm busy, can't you see that?

29:52.442 --> 29:54.475
Well, I need to know
where I'm going...

29:54.609 --> 29:57.176
I'm like the other nurse.
You know, I'm also busy.

29:57.343 --> 29:58.508
This is my patient.

29:58.742 --> 30:03.475
Mrs. Eliza Patrick.
And Mrs. Patrick needs me.

30:03.642 --> 30:04.909
Who is your supervisor?

30:05.309 --> 30:06.909
I'm sorry, I don't have time
to talk to you.

30:07.042 --> 30:08.442
Who is your supervisor?

30:08.575 --> 30:10.542
I want to tell them about
your poor customer service.

30:10.675 --> 30:12.442
You're the one
who can't find her way around

30:12.542 --> 30:14.243
one story of a building.

30:14.475 --> 30:16.109
I'm gonna tell
everyone about that.

30:16.942 --> 30:18.343
Are you my nurse?

30:18.642 --> 30:21.442
- Yes, ma'am, I am.
- I need to get up for a bit.

30:21.575 --> 30:23.742
Nah. I think that's a bad idea.

30:24.209 --> 30:25.309
<i>Nurse!</i>

30:26.042 --> 30:28.542
- <i>Can I get a nurse in here?</i>
- Where are you going?

30:28.775 --> 30:30.142
To help this screaming man.

30:30.309 --> 30:31.876
- <i>Nurse?</i>
- What is your name?

30:32.009 --> 30:32.942
Mandy.

30:33.809 --> 30:36.142
Well, I'm gonna report you,
Mandy!

30:40.775 --> 30:42.209
I think I must be done.

30:43.142 --> 30:47.508
- Been here for over two hours.
- Probably so, then.

30:50.609 --> 30:52.675
What's happening to you in here?

30:52.876 --> 30:53.775
What?

30:55.742 --> 30:58.176
Dialysis.

30:58.675 --> 31:01.809
- Are you a nurse or what?
- Obviously.

31:03.209 --> 31:04.876
Look at my outfit.

31:05.475 --> 31:06.909
Could you turn that TV up?

31:07.042 --> 31:08.375
Can't hear anything.

31:12.909 --> 31:13.909
What happened?

31:14.675 --> 31:17.408
She tried to stand.
I saw her from the hallway.

31:17.675 --> 31:19.309
I didn't think she'd wake up.

31:19.575 --> 31:22.076
- She's stronger than she looks.
- Mrs. Patrick?

31:22.209 --> 31:23.675
Your daughter just stepped out.

31:23.809 --> 31:25.809
We need to get you
back in the bed, okay?

31:26.042 --> 31:26.809
Where is she?

31:27.176 --> 31:29.742
Call her daughter, please,
and tell her she's awake.

31:30.142 --> 31:31.076
Come on now.

31:33.408 --> 31:35.009
- That's right.
- Up we go.

31:40.209 --> 31:41.475
Where is Shawna?

31:42.309 --> 31:46.209
Mrs. Patrick. Eliza.
Listen to me, okay?

31:46.475 --> 31:48.009
We're here to take care of you.

31:52.742 --> 31:54.775
- Stay here a minute, will you?
- Okay.

32:10.343 --> 32:11.709
Shit.

32:14.942 --> 32:16.009
What the fuck?

32:16.742 --> 32:19.675
- It's bleach.
- Oh, my sweet Jesus.

32:19.876 --> 32:20.976
Did you say bleach?

32:21.809 --> 32:23.675
- Mr. Collins?
- He's gone.

32:25.343 --> 32:27.942
Oh, no! Oh!

32:28.343 --> 32:29.542
What the fuck happened to him?

32:29.709 --> 32:31.442
- I don't know.
- Have you lost your damn mind?

32:31.542 --> 32:32.642
I can't cover
something like this.

32:32.709 --> 32:34.976
- No. Dammit. It wasn't me.
- You sure?

32:35.309 --> 32:36.475
Yes.

32:36.675 --> 32:38.909
- Somebody call the cops?
- Yep.

32:39.243 --> 32:40.408
Damn!

32:45.009 --> 32:46.609
- You going home?
- They told me to wait

32:46.675 --> 32:47.876
and give a statement.

32:48.742 --> 32:52.408
- We are fucked.
- I know, Karen.

32:56.076 --> 32:58.642
This is gonna set us way back.

32:58.775 --> 33:00.309
We can't do anything
for weeks now.

33:00.742 --> 33:03.408
Do you think I don't fucking
know that, Karen? Damn.

33:03.542 --> 33:05.109
Well, if you didn't do it,
who did?

33:07.209 --> 33:09.176
You know,
he was really depressed.

33:09.309 --> 33:11.142
Ain't nobody drinking bleach,
Mandy.

33:11.309 --> 33:15.142
Then I don't know.

33:16.408 --> 33:17.909
Is there any more cake?

33:20.076 --> 33:21.508
- What?
- Oh, my God.

33:22.142 --> 33:23.375
Wha...

33:24.508 --> 33:25.942
Oh, good.

33:36.475 --> 33:38.742
Oh, goddammit. What the fuck
are you doing here?

33:38.876 --> 33:40.775
Why are you wearing that?

33:41.042 --> 33:42.343
This is not funny, Regina.

33:42.475 --> 33:43.942
You need to get
the fuck outta here.

33:44.076 --> 33:45.343
We just had an a...

33:49.942 --> 33:51.009
What did you do?

33:52.408 --> 33:57.642
- Uh... Well, I was...
- What the hell did you do?

33:58.176 --> 34:00.375
Nothing,
I was just helping you out.

34:02.709 --> 34:05.909
Did you pour bleach
down that man's throat?

34:07.176 --> 34:08.408
Yeah.

34:09.076 --> 34:11.009
I just did what you do.

34:11.542 --> 34:14.575
- That is not what I do.
- Hmm?

34:15.642 --> 34:19.076
Why, I need that man's kidney.
I need it tonight.

34:19.609 --> 34:21.309
Just give it to me
and I'll leave.

34:21.742 --> 34:23.309
I'll go, you won't ever see
me again.

34:23.442 --> 34:24.609
Oh, my God.

34:27.508 --> 34:28.809
You're so stupid.

34:29.675 --> 34:33.675
You are such a stupid bitch.

34:34.343 --> 34:35.442
Excuse me?

34:36.309 --> 34:39.408
- Fuck you.
- You are so dumb.

34:40.675 --> 34:42.809
Do you know what dialysis is?

34:43.375 --> 34:45.176
Mr. Collins was on dialysis

34:45.343 --> 34:47.243
because his kidneys
are so shitty

34:47.375 --> 34:48.942
he can't flush out
his own system.

34:49.076 --> 34:52.109
So even if I was stupid enough
to help you,

34:52.442 --> 34:54.243
that man's kidneys are useless.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.709
You killed an innocent man
for no reason.

34:58.209 --> 34:59.642
Do you understand that?

35:02.675 --> 35:04.909
I'm not leaving
till you give me a kidney.

35:05.309 --> 35:06.742
You are gonna leave.

35:07.243 --> 35:09.009
And you are gonna leave
right now.

35:09.876 --> 35:13.076
The cops are coming here.
And when they get here,

35:13.375 --> 35:15.876
I'm gonna tell them
who did this shit,

35:16.442 --> 35:18.209
the girl posing as a nurse

35:18.575 --> 35:21.076
standing in the storage room
like an idiot.

35:22.176 --> 35:23.909
You wouldn't turn on me
like that.

35:24.209 --> 35:26.009
You brought me
into this whole thing.

35:26.976 --> 35:28.609
Oh, like hell I wouldn't.

35:29.442 --> 35:31.542
Then I'll tell them everything.

35:32.176 --> 35:34.375
All the bad stuff about you...

35:35.408 --> 35:37.009
about your little operation.

35:37.709 --> 35:40.408
Hell, about all the drugs
you do in here.

35:43.942 --> 35:46.542
If I leave here
without a kidney...

35:47.343 --> 35:48.508
I'm dead.

36:08.809 --> 36:10.609
What happened to this guy?

36:10.942 --> 36:12.076
Alcohol and morphine.

36:13.176 --> 36:14.809
- Is he dead?
- No.

36:16.109 --> 36:17.408
Whoa.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.976
Is this, like, a prisoner
or something?

36:20.109 --> 36:21.408
Mm, he's perfect.

36:21.542 --> 36:23.309
Just bleach him
and take his kidney.

36:23.742 --> 36:26.575
Probably deserves it.
What did he do?

36:27.042 --> 36:28.375
Haven't you heard?

36:29.375 --> 36:31.742
Murder. I murdered a cop.

36:32.009 --> 36:33.475
I hate cops...

36:34.842 --> 36:36.542
but I love blondes.

36:39.909 --> 36:42.542
- We didn't know you were awake.
- Come on.

36:42.775 --> 36:46.642
Take one of my kidneys,
and I'll take one of yours.

36:46.976 --> 36:47.942
Fuck.

36:48.575 --> 36:50.109
Hey, you ever do it
on someone who's awake?

36:50.209 --> 36:51.742
I... I mean,
he could still work.

36:52.009 --> 36:53.709
No, stop trying to help.

36:55.343 --> 36:56.542
Give me an hour, wait outside.

36:56.842 --> 36:58.709
Okay, fine,
but we have to hurry.

36:58.942 --> 36:59.976
An hour.

37:21.642 --> 37:23.775
Lucky you got family checks
on you.

37:43.109 --> 37:46.609
I could've used this tonight.
Hope you enjoy it.

38:01.309 --> 38:03.375
Mandy, you're next.
He needs a statement.

38:03.609 --> 38:05.842
- I was just, uh...
- Mandy, wait right there.

38:05.942 --> 38:06.642
It'll just be a minute.

38:06.876 --> 38:08.709
Ma'am, would you mind
closing the door?

38:08.842 --> 38:09.976
Okay. Sit.

38:13.209 --> 38:14.775
Hour's up.

38:24.609 --> 38:26.976
Fuck you.

38:37.442 --> 38:39.575
Mikey. Shit.

38:48.343 --> 38:51.642
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

38:52.243 --> 38:54.675
No one else in the unit
at the time that you know of?

38:54.942 --> 38:55.809
- No.
- No, sir.

38:56.142 --> 39:00.575
Nothing strange to report
when you saw Mr. Collins last?

39:01.042 --> 39:02.109
- Nope.
- No, sir.

39:02.742 --> 39:05.176
Although he was always
a bit surly.

39:05.575 --> 39:07.009
We'll notify the family.

39:08.109 --> 39:10.675
His poor family.

39:11.442 --> 39:12.775
They were never around.

39:13.508 --> 39:14.809
Well, it doesn't make it right.

39:15.109 --> 39:16.642
No, ma'am, it does not.

39:19.508 --> 39:20.442
Have a good night, officer.

39:20.609 --> 39:22.343
Uh, No, I'm staying
here till morning,

39:22.508 --> 39:24.243
just to make sure
you ladies are safe.

39:24.709 --> 39:26.408
Just gotta take care
of you ladies.

39:26.675 --> 39:28.642
I wanna keep an eye on things.

39:28.876 --> 39:31.675
Make sure that
no bad guys get in.

39:32.442 --> 39:34.042
Yeah, we got another officer
coming by to ask

39:34.176 --> 39:37.109
y'all some questions later.
He's like a detective, you know?

39:37.243 --> 39:39.109
I'm just sorta night shift.

39:39.842 --> 39:42.276
You know, I... I think y'all
got nothing to worry about.

39:42.475 --> 39:43.575
It was just
an out-of-the-ordinary

39:43.742 --> 39:46.809
- type situation.
- Well, you can say that again.

39:47.408 --> 39:48.709
It was just
an out-of-the-ordinary

39:48.842 --> 39:49.775
type situation.

39:51.609 --> 39:53.909
Oh.

39:54.408 --> 39:55.575
I get it.

39:59.176 --> 40:02.243
But I'll be here, all night.

40:02.675 --> 40:03.976
You two will be safe.

40:06.343 --> 40:08.408
- Are we done here?
- Yes, ma'am.

40:08.642 --> 40:09.742
That's all my questions.

40:10.442 --> 40:11.942
I got a lot of patients
to get to.

40:16.475 --> 40:19.109
Karen, Karen, Karen, Karen.

40:19.309 --> 40:21.142
Are you sure you don't have
a room for me?

40:21.276 --> 40:23.609
- Mr. Kent.
- Hmm?

40:23.809 --> 40:25.909
We have to get to
the priority problems first.

40:26.009 --> 40:27.542
I mean, look at you.
You're walking around,

40:27.675 --> 40:29.343
you're standing up. I...
I don't know even know

40:29.475 --> 40:31.042
- what's wrong with you.
- I'm dizzy.

40:31.209 --> 40:34.042
You don't need a room.

40:36.109 --> 40:37.842
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:42.475 --> 40:45.709
- You get interviewed?
- By that cute cop?

40:46.508 --> 40:48.742
- Yeah.
- He funny, ain't he?

40:48.876 --> 40:51.642
I like 'em funny, and rich.

40:52.209 --> 40:53.442
But he ain't rich.

40:55.876 --> 40:58.842
Mr. Kent.
Go sit down and wait your turn.

40:59.009 --> 41:00.109
You are nosy as hell.

41:01.343 --> 41:03.109
It's too stuffy in here, so.

41:04.809 --> 41:08.243
Someone expired in the ICU.
The coroner just left.

41:08.542 --> 41:11.142
And the body is in the morgue
waiting to be transferred.

41:11.609 --> 41:13.475
But I thought we agreed.

41:14.876 --> 41:17.675
Extenuating circumstances.
I'll explain later.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.542
Well, damn, bitch,
you could've warned me.

41:20.209 --> 41:22.276
You know, I got a bad heart,
I can't take this shit.

41:22.442 --> 41:23.642
Trust me.

41:23.876 --> 41:25.942
Trust you about as far
as I can throw you.

41:31.142 --> 41:32.076
Mr. Kent.

41:34.142 --> 41:35.442
Mr. Kent?

41:36.209 --> 41:37.508
We have a room for you.

41:40.375 --> 41:41.542
Where the hell did he go?

42:31.076 --> 42:32.042
Shit.

42:48.976 --> 42:49.942
Shit.

43:02.176 --> 43:03.408
Shit.

43:13.775 --> 43:17.976
Hey. Isn't it a little late
for you to be out here skating?

43:48.243 --> 43:49.508
Amen.

Oh. Sorry.
Heard a noise.

45:38.408 --> 45:41.508
- Uh. It was me.
- Yeah.

45:42.609 --> 45:45.542
What happened?

45:48.542 --> 45:51.042
Man, y'all sure do get dirty,
huh?

45:54.142 --> 45:56.542
I could not do that.

45:56.842 --> 45:58.408
You want some help
with this guy?

45:59.142 --> 46:00.076
Uh...

46:00.876 --> 46:01.575
Sure.

46:02.009 --> 46:04.209
Sorry, I'm trying
to be a gentleman and all.

46:06.109 --> 46:07.809
One, two.

46:12.775 --> 46:15.009
You guys probably get a lot
of back issues, huh?

46:15.709 --> 46:16.909
Some people do.

46:18.042 --> 46:19.408
You look like you work in a...

46:20.243 --> 46:21.809
butcher shop.

46:24.076 --> 46:25.209
Hey, you want a soda?

46:25.775 --> 46:27.675
I just got an extra one
from the machine.

46:30.243 --> 46:31.408
I'm good.

46:32.976 --> 46:35.309
No offense, uh,
this room is real creepy.

46:35.442 --> 46:38.775
- And smells, so.
- Uh. Yeah.

46:39.343 --> 46:41.508
Totally.

46:43.309 --> 46:44.442
Wow.

46:48.642 --> 46:50.408
Oh, sorry.

46:52.309 --> 46:53.609
Probably not allowed
to touch that, huh?

46:53.842 --> 46:58.375
- Yeah. Better not.
- I mean, oh, okay.

46:58.508 --> 47:00.109
Just trying to be,
make a joke, you know?

47:00.243 --> 47:02.442
It's pretty disgusting.

47:02.876 --> 47:04.575
Not that I'm not used
to seeing...

47:05.375 --> 47:06.876
disgusting things. I mean, I...

47:07.642 --> 47:09.442
I really am.
You'd be surprised what happens.

47:09.575 --> 47:11.976
This one guy, he, um,
yeah, I mean, he, uh...

47:13.942 --> 47:15.809
Guess I don't really have
any stories.

47:15.942 --> 47:18.742
You know, just stuff happens,
you know? Yeah.

47:19.209 --> 47:20.375
It's kinda like, you
know, like <i>Cops,</i>

47:20.508 --> 47:23.109
- if you've ever seen that show.
- You know...

47:25.442 --> 47:28.575
- I think I will take that soda.
- All right.

47:31.408 --> 47:35.775
I'm so glad you're here,
to take care of us...

47:36.442 --> 47:37.976
to make sure we're safe.

47:40.742 --> 47:42.375
Just doing my job.

47:46.142 --> 47:47.575
I'll let you get back to yours.

47:47.709 --> 47:50.575
Mm-hmm. Bye.

48:23.976 --> 48:24.976
Shit.

48:28.475 --> 48:30.575
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Dorothy?

48:30.809 --> 48:32.842
Mandy?
I gotta go get that cute cop

48:32.976 --> 48:36.442
'cause I swear to God, there's
a dead body over there!

48:36.709 --> 48:39.709
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
There's another one.

48:39.876 --> 48:42.575
- A dead body, can you hear me?
- Where?

48:43.109 --> 48:44.408
- Huh?
- Where?

48:44.642 --> 48:46.709
Over by the storage shed!

48:46.775 --> 48:48.475
I don't know what I was...
I just went out there,

48:48.575 --> 48:50.542
just looking for somewhere
outta the rain to smoke.

48:50.675 --> 48:52.442
Oh, God, I shouldn't even
be smoking!

48:52.675 --> 48:54.408
And then...
and then there was a dead body!

48:54.675 --> 48:56.942
Do you know what that means?
Mandy!

48:57.076 --> 48:58.976
There is a murderer
loose in the hospital.

48:59.209 --> 49:02.109
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.

49:02.375 --> 49:06.642
- We're gonna die. Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

49:20.343 --> 49:22.642
- So, are you a doctor?
- No, I'm a nurse.

49:22.942 --> 49:25.209
Now go sit down.
I'll be with you in a minute.

49:29.408 --> 49:32.142
- We have a problem.
- Yeah, no kidding.

49:32.909 --> 49:34.742
Y'all found
someone to help me yet?

49:35.642 --> 49:36.609
Nope.

49:37.508 --> 49:38.876
Just let me know
when you do.

49:42.276 --> 49:43.542
Y'all... y'all stay safe.

49:44.109 --> 49:45.976
- Okay.
- What the hell?

49:47.109 --> 49:49.009
I guess we have multiple
problems.

49:49.809 --> 49:50.809
I need your help.

49:52.375 --> 49:53.809
Mandy, what did you get into?

49:53.942 --> 49:56.375
I'm just gonna apologize
in advance.

50:00.575 --> 50:02.375
<i>Wait, so this bitch
might be wearing scrubs?</i>

50:02.642 --> 50:05.042
She might be snorting up all
the Valium in the building,

50:05.176 --> 50:07.076
for all I know.
She's fucking nuts.

50:07.475 --> 50:09.343
I don't like it when
people call women nuts.

50:09.475 --> 50:11.243
It's just an excuse
to belittle their problems.

50:11.408 --> 50:13.243
And mental health
is nothing to belittle.

50:13.709 --> 50:16.076
This bitch is actually nuts.

50:16.343 --> 50:18.042
Say what you want,
doesn't mean I like it.

50:18.442 --> 50:20.176
- Excuse me, ladies?
- Not now, all right?

50:20.309 --> 50:21.209
Fine.

50:21.343 --> 50:22.542
<i>So, what's your plan here?</i>

50:22.909 --> 50:25.309
<i>Find this crazy bitch
and get her the fuck outta here</i>

50:25.442 --> 50:27.142
<i>before she tells on both of us.</i>

50:27.408 --> 50:28.475
<i>You're sure this was her?</i>

50:28.709 --> 50:29.609
<i>Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

50:30.142 --> 50:31.976
<i>Why would you bring
this cousin of yours into this</i>

50:32.109 --> 50:34.742
<i>if you knew she would kill
people and rat us both out?</i>

50:34.942 --> 50:37.542
I sometimes have
too much faith in humanity.

50:40.042 --> 50:41.375
That is what I like about you.

50:46.142 --> 50:48.542
But just so you know, if either
of you get me in trouble,

50:48.675 --> 50:51.076
I will ask God
to strike you both down,

50:51.209 --> 50:52.508
'cause he listens to me.

50:58.642 --> 50:59.575
Shit.

51:08.775 --> 51:11.142
Come on.

51:13.675 --> 51:15.343
- Ah, shit.
- We're going on a walk.

51:15.475 --> 51:16.442
All right.

51:16.809 --> 51:18.408
Hey, Dr. Wilder.

51:28.909 --> 51:29.976
Y'all look mad.

51:31.675 --> 51:33.142
Damn, bitch, where's your shoes?

51:33.343 --> 51:34.809
That guy pooped on them
when he died.

51:34.909 --> 51:36.475
Oh, Lord, you're right,
she is a murderer.

51:36.609 --> 51:38.042
Y'all are murderers first.

51:39.609 --> 51:43.109
- Look, I... I can explain.
- Mm-hmm.

51:43.909 --> 51:44.609
Yeah.

51:44.909 --> 51:47.042
- Are those your panties?
- Yeah.

51:47.309 --> 51:48.942
It's all I had to put
the kidney in.

51:49.375 --> 51:50.508
And I didn't hear from you

51:50.709 --> 51:52.142
and...
and it had been over an hour...

51:52.276 --> 51:54.309
I was caught up
in the mess you created.

51:54.442 --> 51:55.609
Well, I was all alone...

51:56.243 --> 51:58.775
and then Mikey came and there
was a cop waiting around...

51:59.176 --> 52:01.775
- Did they see you?
- No, never, I was just hiding.

52:02.076 --> 52:03.709
And then that kid came,
so I went over there

52:03.842 --> 52:05.575
- and I just... I...
- ...got it.

52:05.709 --> 52:07.475
Stop. You need to get
the fuck outta here.

52:07.609 --> 52:09.508
Those cops are gonna be
looking for you

52:09.642 --> 52:11.109
or anybody that did this shit.

52:11.276 --> 52:13.942
And there's some creep outside
waiting to rip your tits off.

52:14.076 --> 52:16.609
Well, it's fine now
'cause I have a kidney.

52:17.042 --> 52:19.475
Now I can see Mikey.
He won't rip my tits off.

52:19.609 --> 52:21.909
- That ain't no kidney.
- What isn't?

52:22.475 --> 52:25.243
That is not a kidney.
That's a bladder.

52:25.475 --> 52:27.209
- Oh, Lord Jesus.
- But how do you know that?

52:27.408 --> 52:29.375
I don't know if my heart
can take this right now.

52:29.809 --> 52:31.309
I saw where you opened
that kid up.

52:31.442 --> 52:32.575
You didn't even go in the back.

52:32.809 --> 52:35.042
No, my... my...
my kidneys are right here.

52:35.209 --> 52:37.243
Those are your ovaries.

52:37.809 --> 52:40.475
That is a bladder.
Damn, you're nuts!

52:40.775 --> 52:43.009
Maybe you should think
about this shit

52:43.142 --> 52:44.309
before you go murdering someone.

52:44.442 --> 52:45.343
I hate you.

52:47.076 --> 52:48.909
Shit. They're coming for me.

52:49.542 --> 52:51.276
It's just the storm.

52:51.842 --> 52:53.109
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

52:53.276 --> 52:55.876
<i>I have to inform you that we
are in a lock down situation.</i>

52:57.176 --> 52:58.909
Oh, that is not necessary.

52:59.709 --> 53:01.876
<i>Do not exit
or enter the building.</i>

53:03.575 --> 53:05.109
Shit, I gotta get
the fuck outta here.

53:05.508 --> 53:06.876
I just, I'm gonna go run.

53:09.176 --> 53:11.176
- I'm just gonna run outta here.
- Stop.

53:12.508 --> 53:14.375
I got you a kidney,
like I said I would.

53:14.642 --> 53:15.675
It's down by the soda machine.

53:15.942 --> 53:19.343
Go down there, get it,
and get the fuck outta here.

53:19.542 --> 53:21.709
But there's cops outside.

53:22.508 --> 53:23.508
Karen will walk you out.

53:23.642 --> 53:24.876
- Mm-mm.
- And I'll distract the cops.

53:24.942 --> 53:26.876
I... I'm not going anywhere
with that murderer, no.

53:26.942 --> 53:27.642
I'm pulling rank.

53:27.976 --> 53:29.575
All right, all right,
all right, fine.

53:31.009 --> 53:31.976
I will walk you out.

53:32.842 --> 53:34.742
Will you kindly...

53:35.343 --> 53:37.243
distract the cops?

53:37.442 --> 53:39.209
Just get them
to the waiting room

53:39.343 --> 53:40.542
and we'll sneak out the back.

53:43.243 --> 53:46.542
Fuck, can't believe I'm taking
pity on your redneck ass.

53:46.809 --> 53:49.508
Okay, give me ten minutes...

53:50.575 --> 53:52.176
and if I catch...

53:52.709 --> 53:56.109
your skinny ass,
impersonating a nurse again,

53:56.609 --> 53:58.508
I will rip your bladder out.

53:58.775 --> 54:01.542
- Okay. Thank you.
- She said, "Thank you."

54:02.775 --> 54:04.909
- Ten minutes.
- Yeah, ten minutes.

54:05.408 --> 54:07.909
We're just gonna wait here
for a minute.

54:10.575 --> 54:13.809
<i>Hospital,
code red. Shelter in place.</i>

54:17.343 --> 54:18.542
Um...

54:20.475 --> 54:21.508
Let's go to the nurse's station.

54:21.609 --> 54:22.842
We're gonna go
to the nurse's station.

54:22.976 --> 54:25.009
Why do we have to go
to the nurse's station?

54:25.709 --> 54:27.508
- We just have to.
- Why?

54:28.076 --> 54:29.142
People are there.

54:38.909 --> 54:39.842
Throw that away.

54:42.408 --> 54:43.609
<i>Hospital, code red.</i>

54:43.742 --> 54:45.842
- You look sweaty.
- Shut up, let's go.

54:46.042 --> 54:47.009
Wait.

54:48.709 --> 54:51.109
- I just wanna go home.
- It's late

54:51.243 --> 54:52.542
and I can't get a hold
of anyone.

54:52.775 --> 54:54.109
Well, then I'm going on a break.

54:54.276 --> 54:57.475
We don't have time for you
to take a break, Dorothy.

54:59.209 --> 55:02.243
Mandy, I need you out front.
Someone needs to be out there

55:02.375 --> 55:03.508
to keep the public
from getting in.

55:03.642 --> 55:06.609
It's like no one understands
what lockdown means.

55:07.742 --> 55:09.909
I was just, um...
I was just going out

55:10.042 --> 55:11.976
- for a smoke break.
- Is that a joke?

55:12.309 --> 55:14.909
And you, little missy, need to
get back to your own floor.

55:15.209 --> 55:16.243
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh-huh.

55:16.542 --> 55:18.742
- I'll take her.
- Why would you need to do that?

55:19.343 --> 55:20.508
Dammit, Mandy.

55:20.775 --> 55:24.009
There is too much going on.
Just go before I write you up.

55:25.375 --> 55:27.642
It's just been a long night.

55:28.142 --> 55:33.009
For everyone. It's been
a long night for everyone.

55:33.642 --> 55:34.375
Go.

55:34.876 --> 55:36.375
<i>Hospital,
code red. Shelter in place.</i>

55:36.442 --> 55:37.675
Double go.

56:31.609 --> 56:33.675
- Hey, you can't be back here.
- Help.

56:34.243 --> 56:35.876
Help, really scary guy...

56:36.009 --> 56:37.142
...in the waiting room.

56:37.508 --> 56:39.542
Probably the murderer
that you're looking for.

56:40.142 --> 56:41.542
Huge, very huge, hulking.

56:41.942 --> 56:44.408
- Okay, you stay here...
- Nope, no, no, no.

56:44.542 --> 56:46.243
Definitely both of you
'cause...

56:46.375 --> 56:49.142
...he's huge.
So can you just, like...

56:50.343 --> 56:52.042
Yes, waiting room.

57:01.375 --> 57:02.475
Oh, it's you.

57:03.009 --> 57:04.809
Finally, I... I was calling
about my mother.

57:18.675 --> 57:20.742
What can I do for you?

57:22.642 --> 57:25.142
Oh, hi, we're on lock down.
You can't be on this floor.

57:26.276 --> 57:28.675
Uh. Excuse me, who are you?

57:30.642 --> 57:31.609
Hello?

57:32.276 --> 57:33.475
Excuse me!

57:34.276 --> 57:35.909
We are on lockdown!

57:37.942 --> 57:39.942
Did...
did you speak to my daughter?

57:40.142 --> 57:41.343
- What?
- You said you were gonna

57:41.475 --> 57:43.475
- get her back up here.
- That... that was someone else.

57:43.642 --> 57:45.876
My daughter needs
to know that I'm sick.

57:46.508 --> 57:49.176
That's the reason
I'm in this fancy hotel.

57:49.309 --> 57:51.243
Uh. Wha... wha...
what kind of sick?

57:51.442 --> 57:53.809
I feel nauseated.
Can I get a warm towel?

57:53.942 --> 57:56.976
- I'll get a nurse.
- You look like a nurse.

57:58.343 --> 57:59.276
Who are you?

57:59.475 --> 58:01.042
You are not supposed to be
in here.

58:02.542 --> 58:04.442
- I'm a new nurse.
- In what unit?

58:04.675 --> 58:08.076
- Uh. Today's my first day.
- Where do you work?

58:09.309 --> 58:11.842
Third floor.
I just came down here

58:11.976 --> 58:14.909
'cause, uh, I know this...
this woman.

58:15.076 --> 58:16.042
Does she know you?

58:16.675 --> 58:20.508
She's sick. Obviously.
Doesn't remember a damn thing,

58:20.642 --> 58:24.009
but we are such good...

58:24.675 --> 58:28.408
- friends from church.
- I do go to church.

58:29.209 --> 58:32.408
Well, what... is her name?

58:33.508 --> 58:36.909
Uh. Patrick. Uh. Mrs. Patrick.

58:38.042 --> 58:39.276
That's my married name.

58:39.508 --> 58:41.809
Okay. Fine. Sorry, Mrs. Patrick.

58:42.475 --> 58:44.942
I didn't realize that you
were such good friends.

58:45.176 --> 58:46.276
You know we're on a lockdown?

58:46.675 --> 58:48.408
You're not supposed
to leave your floor.

58:49.042 --> 58:49.775
Really?

58:49.909 --> 58:51.309
There was a dead body.

58:51.475 --> 58:54.508
I found it. I was smoking,
please don't tell.

58:55.309 --> 58:56.343
You need to go back upstairs.

58:56.475 --> 58:57.675
Did they not announce
it up on third?

58:57.809 --> 58:59.609
- No, no, no.
- Yes, they did.

58:59.809 --> 59:02.609
You gotta get back up there.
Where are your shoes?

59:03.809 --> 59:04.775
Uh...

59:11.142 --> 59:14.109
- Help me!
- No, no.

59:14.243 --> 59:16.508
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no.

59:18.675 --> 59:20.642
I threw up.

59:21.276 --> 59:23.475
Can you get that
warm towel for me?

59:28.876 --> 59:31.542
You better not have
given me a disease.

59:34.609 --> 59:37.009
Dammit. Goddammit.

59:39.209 --> 59:40.375
You're strong.

59:43.209 --> 59:45.642
Dammit! Dammit!

59:46.542 --> 59:48.675
Ma'am, are you okay?

59:51.243 --> 59:53.475
Help me! Help us!

59:56.309 --> 59:58.442
Hey, girl. Are you new?

1:00:16.809 --> 1:00:18.243
Where do you think
you're going?

1:00:18.976 --> 1:00:20.675
Just heading back
to the third floor.

1:00:20.809 --> 1:00:22.842
No, ma'am. No elevators
'cause of lock down.

1:00:22.976 --> 1:00:25.508
- You gotta take the stairs.
- Mm. Okay.

1:00:26.642 --> 1:00:28.408
And make sure
that someone from your floor

1:00:28.542 --> 1:00:29.642
comes down to assist the cops.

1:00:29.876 --> 1:00:31.542
- Sure.
- We can't do everything.

1:00:31.909 --> 1:00:32.942
Yep, thanks.

1:00:37.442 --> 1:00:38.508
Could you tell if he was armed?

1:00:38.742 --> 1:00:40.742
I don't know, don't murderers
always have weapons?

1:00:46.243 --> 1:00:48.709
Well, I... I mean, he was...
he was here just a minute ago.

1:00:48.842 --> 1:00:50.508
Uh. And like I said,
he was really, really...

1:00:50.709 --> 1:00:51.742
He was really horrible-looking.

1:00:51.909 --> 1:00:53.809
- Maybe he left.
- Or... or maybe he went back

1:00:53.942 --> 1:00:55.408
into the hospital
and murder more people.

1:00:55.542 --> 1:00:58.742
Murder people? What is going on?
Are we in danger here?

1:00:58.876 --> 1:01:01.309
No, ma'am, everything is fine.
Just remain calm.

1:01:01.442 --> 1:01:03.042
Well, I need to know
what's going on.

1:01:03.408 --> 1:01:05.942
- I'm going. Good luck.
- Okay, good luck to you.

1:01:16.942 --> 1:01:17.976
Well, hello.

1:01:18.942 --> 1:01:19.842
Wow.

1:01:20.375 --> 1:01:22.276
You look fucking gross, Regina.

1:01:22.909 --> 1:01:25.009
You know, I've been...

1:01:25.142 --> 1:01:26.809
I've been looking for you,
skanky.

1:01:27.742 --> 1:01:28.675
Good.

1:01:29.408 --> 1:01:31.309
I was looking for you too.

1:01:31.442 --> 1:01:33.442
Hmm, you know,
I'm supposed to drag you back

1:01:33.575 --> 1:01:34.842
to Nicholas by your hair.

1:01:34.942 --> 1:01:37.109
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

1:01:37.243 --> 1:01:40.009
Now, I've got legs.
I can just walk.

1:01:40.408 --> 1:01:43.042
Don't you want a damn kidney?

1:01:43.309 --> 1:01:44.976
Oh, it's a little late for that.

1:01:45.842 --> 1:01:46.742
Look...

1:01:47.343 --> 1:01:50.276
it's not my fault.
My stupid cousin...

1:01:50.942 --> 1:01:54.209
she lost it, but...
but she got me another one.

1:01:54.343 --> 1:01:56.142
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1:01:59.109 --> 1:01:59.809
No.

1:02:00.176 --> 1:02:03.609
No, do not try all that
sexy shit with me, Regina.

1:02:03.775 --> 1:02:05.709
You are covered in blood
and puke.

1:02:08.343 --> 1:02:09.508
Not impressed.

1:02:10.475 --> 1:02:12.609
- Told you.
- That's a great cooler.

1:02:13.009 --> 1:02:15.942
- Can you open it up?
- A lot of work went into this.

1:02:16.609 --> 1:02:21.709
You wouldn't believe the trouble
we went to to get you this.

1:02:22.508 --> 1:02:24.109
Now, what the fuck?

1:02:26.609 --> 1:02:29.009
What the fuck indeed, Regina.

1:02:29.109 --> 1:02:30.209
Come here.

1:02:30.309 --> 1:02:31.575
- Oh, wait.
- Come here!

1:02:43.142 --> 1:02:44.076
Thanks for these.

1:02:45.542 --> 1:02:47.675
Maybe the nicest thing
you ever did for me.

1:02:48.243 --> 1:02:50.076
Mandy?

1:02:51.609 --> 1:02:53.675
This is the suspicious woman,
ma'am?

1:02:54.209 --> 1:02:55.542
I don't think so.

1:02:56.343 --> 1:02:57.842
It is Mandy, isn't it?

1:02:58.508 --> 1:03:00.508
- Yeah.
- This isn't her.

1:03:01.642 --> 1:03:02.575
Mandy?

1:03:03.375 --> 1:03:04.842
What are you doing
with my patient?

1:03:05.042 --> 1:03:06.343
- Excuse me.
- Uh...

1:03:06.542 --> 1:03:08.876
Goddammit! Again?

1:03:09.475 --> 1:03:11.009
All right, now go over
with me again

1:03:11.142 --> 1:03:13.209
where you were around 2:00 a.m.

1:03:13.609 --> 1:03:15.142
- You saw me.
- In the morgue.

1:03:15.276 --> 1:03:16.442
What were you doing
in the morgue?

1:03:16.575 --> 1:03:17.842
You have no business
being in there.

1:03:18.009 --> 1:03:20.842
I was checking
a deceased patient's records.

1:03:21.076 --> 1:03:24.243
Officer Myers,
this woman is on probation.

1:03:24.475 --> 1:03:26.309
That is an internal probation

1:03:26.442 --> 1:03:27.609
and he doesn't need to know
about it.

1:03:27.775 --> 1:03:30.876
It's relevant
and now it's extended.

1:03:31.575 --> 1:03:33.209
If you were checking records

1:03:33.343 --> 1:03:35.642
in the morgue,
why were you covered in blood?

1:03:36.609 --> 1:03:38.243
Oh, that's what happens
in a morgue.

1:03:38.442 --> 1:03:40.809
- But you changed?
- That's what we do.

1:03:40.976 --> 1:03:42.909
Don't wanna walk around
covered in blood.

1:03:45.109 --> 1:03:46.042
That's right.

1:03:47.709 --> 1:03:49.909
Come on, Janet, you know me.

1:03:50.942 --> 1:03:52.675
What were you doing
with those vials?

1:03:52.909 --> 1:03:55.542
Checking them,
seeing what you had him on.

1:03:55.742 --> 1:03:57.775
- And why would you do that?
- Hey.

1:03:58.709 --> 1:04:00.609
That's enough. I think
we're gonna have to go down

1:04:00.742 --> 1:04:02.309
to the station
and talk this thing out.

1:04:02.575 --> 1:04:04.209
- Oh!
- Unless, you can explain to me

1:04:04.375 --> 1:04:05.508
what's going on.

1:04:11.276 --> 1:04:12.475
That's my brother.

1:04:14.442 --> 1:04:17.042
That's my brother
in that room in a coma.

1:04:17.642 --> 1:04:20.842
The drug addict.
I was worried about him.

1:04:23.642 --> 1:04:25.142
She's lying.

1:04:25.508 --> 1:04:27.909
She has never mentioned
a brother, not once.

1:04:28.209 --> 1:04:29.942
I'm not lying, Jesus. I'm...

1:04:31.209 --> 1:04:33.809
His name is Andrew McCandry.

1:04:34.343 --> 1:04:35.508
My half-brother.

1:04:35.675 --> 1:04:39.209
He has OD'd three times
in the past two years.

1:04:39.408 --> 1:04:40.742
And this time...

1:04:42.276 --> 1:04:43.609
may be his last,
according to what

1:04:43.742 --> 1:04:46.243
I just read on that chart.
Did you check his files?

1:04:46.375 --> 1:04:47.976
- Yeah.
- That's right, isn't it?

1:04:48.442 --> 1:04:50.109
Yeah. That's right.

1:04:50.442 --> 1:04:52.009
I'm sorry,
I really do trust you.

1:04:52.276 --> 1:04:55.909
I just wanted to make sure
he was getting the best care.

1:04:56.309 --> 1:04:57.976
I care about him and...

1:05:03.375 --> 1:05:05.042
So much I care about him.

1:05:09.375 --> 1:05:10.775
Fuck, I believe you.

1:05:14.942 --> 1:05:16.508
Thank you, Officer Myers.

1:05:17.542 --> 1:05:19.375
But you still gotta come down
to the station with me.

1:05:19.508 --> 1:05:21.042
I got a lot of questions
for you, Mandy.

1:05:21.209 --> 1:05:23.408
I just answered
all your questions.

1:05:23.575 --> 1:05:24.842
Stephen.

1:05:25.442 --> 1:05:28.542
Ma'am. Uh. We got an issue.
A new one.

1:05:30.009 --> 1:05:32.343
Oh. Mandy, come with me.

1:05:33.209 --> 1:05:37.042
I can still get you a kidney.
I know how.

1:05:38.309 --> 1:05:41.109
You are so fucking stupid,
do you know that?

1:05:41.508 --> 1:05:43.842
Every teacher I ever had
told me that already,

1:05:43.976 --> 1:05:44.942
so shut up!

1:05:46.276 --> 1:05:47.542
These nurses...

1:05:48.609 --> 1:05:50.742
they just go for someone
on the verge of death

1:05:50.876 --> 1:05:52.243
so no one notices.

1:05:52.809 --> 1:05:56.109
Me and you can take one
of these dying fuckers

1:05:56.243 --> 1:05:58.176
and just drag him on outta here.

1:05:58.675 --> 1:06:00.508
Use a whole damn body
if you want.

1:06:00.675 --> 1:06:02.042
It'll be fresh as hell.

1:06:02.642 --> 1:06:04.876
You'll probably make Nicholas
real happy.

1:06:05.343 --> 1:06:06.976
Well, you don't just get
a kidney.

1:06:07.176 --> 1:06:09.675
You get all the organs inside.

1:06:10.775 --> 1:06:13.809
I know the exact dying asshole
you can use.

1:06:21.642 --> 1:06:23.709
Just having a lover's quarrel.

1:06:24.809 --> 1:06:25.842
I've been there.

1:06:28.076 --> 1:06:29.076
It's raining, huh?

1:06:29.542 --> 1:06:31.609
Yeah, it's really pissing out
there tonight.

1:06:34.775 --> 1:06:38.742
- I know you. Don't I?
- Regina.

1:06:40.009 --> 1:06:41.842
Didn't you say had someone
you needed to see inside?

1:06:42.009 --> 1:06:45.109
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's leave the man alone.

1:06:48.408 --> 1:06:49.876
Good seeing you again, blondie.

1:06:58.309 --> 1:06:59.542
Call it in.

1:07:00.675 --> 1:07:02.209
- Where's his pants?
- Charmaine,

1:07:02.343 --> 1:07:04.042
we've got a 10-74
at the hospital.

1:07:05.276 --> 1:07:06.542
Looks pretty dead to me.

1:07:25.276 --> 1:07:26.976
Hey, hey, you're not permitted
to leave.

1:07:28.042 --> 1:07:30.309
Hey, Mandy! Mandy, hey!

1:07:30.842 --> 1:07:33.609
Go downstairs, wait for backup.
Hey, hey.

1:07:34.375 --> 1:07:35.675
What the hell's wrong with you?

1:07:35.775 --> 1:07:36.508
<i>Mandy!</i>

1:07:36.675 --> 1:07:38.508
- <i>Someone get in here!</i>
- Co... come on!

1:07:47.675 --> 1:07:49.475
- Whoa.
- What the fuck?

1:07:49.609 --> 1:07:51.209
Please, dear, don't curse.

1:07:51.343 --> 1:07:53.209
She's alive, someone get
a stretcher.

1:07:53.343 --> 1:07:54.942
A... all right, everybody
just calm down.

1:07:55.109 --> 1:07:57.942
- I didn't do it.
- What the fuck is happening?

1:07:58.109 --> 1:08:00.442
- What did you do, Mandy?
- I was with you.

1:08:00.575 --> 1:08:01.942
Hey, hey, stay calm.

1:08:02.542 --> 1:08:04.309
- I'll go get help.
- No, no, you stay here

1:08:04.442 --> 1:08:05.508
and I... I... I'll call it in.

1:08:05.642 --> 1:08:06.942
We need to get that
woman off the ground

1:08:07.042 --> 1:08:09.942
and help her now.
She is bleeding, badly.

1:08:10.209 --> 1:08:11.909
Shit! Fuck! Mandy!

1:08:12.375 --> 1:08:15.176
You are not permitted
to go anywhere.

1:08:16.042 --> 1:08:18.076
I took an oath to help people,
Officer Myers.

1:08:18.209 --> 1:08:20.442
I'm not just gonna leave Dorothy
on the floor dying.

1:08:20.575 --> 1:08:22.675
And I'm telling you
not to fucking move.

1:08:23.508 --> 1:08:25.942
I'll come clean with you.

1:08:26.642 --> 1:08:28.542
There may be someone
in the hospital

1:08:28.675 --> 1:08:31.609
doing all of this
and I know who it is.

1:08:38.276 --> 1:08:40.142
Shit.

1:08:41.343 --> 1:08:42.809
I fucking hate cops.

1:08:44.042 --> 1:08:45.475
But we already went over this.

1:08:51.876 --> 1:08:52.842
Get the fuck off of him.

1:08:53.176 --> 1:08:55.142
I couldn't find any bleach!

1:08:57.375 --> 1:09:00.009
Oh, man!

1:09:00.243 --> 1:09:01.176
Ooh!

1:09:01.442 --> 1:09:04.408
What the fuck? What the fuck?
Fucking bitch!

1:09:04.709 --> 1:09:06.542
Both of you get the fuck outta
here.

1:09:06.742 --> 1:09:08.343
I gotta get some organs.

1:09:08.542 --> 1:09:10.976
There is a kidney in the cooler.

1:09:11.109 --> 1:09:12.142
It's gone!

1:09:12.542 --> 1:09:14.076
- You are lying.
- That's the truth.

1:09:14.842 --> 1:09:17.142
Are you telling me you lost
two kidneys in one night?

1:09:17.276 --> 1:09:18.609
- She said you lost them.
- She did.

1:09:18.675 --> 1:09:19.809
I'm the one who got them
for her.

1:09:19.976 --> 1:09:21.675
- How could I lose 'em?
- This is too much talking.

1:09:21.742 --> 1:09:22.876
We taking this guy with us
or what?

1:09:23.009 --> 1:09:25.375
No, you are not. You are gonna
go back to Nicholas

1:09:25.508 --> 1:09:27.442
and you are gonna tell him
this shit is off.

1:09:27.642 --> 1:09:28.976
He can go to hell
and so can you.

1:09:29.109 --> 1:09:31.575
Come on, what the fuck
did Andrew ever do for you

1:09:31.709 --> 1:09:33.942
except give you an addiction,
huh?

1:09:34.076 --> 1:09:36.675
What the fuck is happening?
Get off of her!

1:09:41.176 --> 1:09:43.742
Fuck.

1:09:46.442 --> 1:09:47.909
Freeze!

1:09:48.042 --> 1:09:49.109
No!

1:09:49.375 --> 1:09:50.742
You freeze.

1:09:51.442 --> 1:09:54.343
Fuck! Fuck.

1:09:55.542 --> 1:09:57.343
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1:09:57.609 --> 1:10:00.343
- I don't wanna shoot you!
- You already fucking shot me!

1:10:00.475 --> 1:10:02.142
I don't wanna shoot you again!

1:10:02.442 --> 1:10:03.876
You fucking asshole.

1:10:03.976 --> 1:10:04.675
I have hostages.

1:10:05.042 --> 1:10:06.408
Just back away from the door
and let me through.

1:10:06.575 --> 1:10:07.775
Don't hurt 'em.

1:10:10.109 --> 1:10:11.442
Patch me up, now!

1:10:11.709 --> 1:10:14.142
- Okay. Okay.
- Come on.

1:10:14.309 --> 1:10:15.508
- I'm coming.
- Fuck.

1:10:15.709 --> 1:10:16.876
Don't try anything weird.

1:10:24.575 --> 1:10:26.309
The bullet is in there.
You need to get it out.

1:10:26.375 --> 1:10:27.442
Yeah, I know that.

1:10:27.609 --> 1:10:29.176
You think this is the first time
I've been shot?

1:10:29.276 --> 1:10:30.742
I'm coming in!

1:10:31.076 --> 1:10:32.742
I swear to God, I will shoot
both these bitches!

1:10:32.909 --> 1:10:35.675
We're gonna go out the backdoor
and you're gonna let us!

1:10:35.809 --> 1:10:36.742
No, you're not!

1:10:36.942 --> 1:10:39.009
I will shoot them
if they try anything!

1:10:39.742 --> 1:10:40.942
And we're taking this fucker
with us.

1:10:41.076 --> 1:10:42.809
- Get him in the wheelchair.
- No fucking way.

1:10:43.142 --> 1:10:45.909
Regina said we can have
all his organs, let's go!

1:10:46.042 --> 1:10:48.809
You are not taking my brother.

1:10:49.009 --> 1:10:52.009
Save him or save yourself.
It's your choice.

1:10:52.142 --> 1:10:53.742
We are taking him regardless.

1:10:54.076 --> 1:10:56.142
Mandy, what's going on in there?

1:11:00.408 --> 1:11:05.709
Okay. I'll do it.
Get that gun out of my face.

1:11:08.176 --> 1:11:09.109
Regina, get the wheelchair.

1:11:14.176 --> 1:11:15.575
Let's go. Go, go, go, go.

1:11:17.909 --> 1:11:19.775
Damn, get the thing out
of his face.

1:11:24.109 --> 1:11:26.709
Come on, hang on. Dammit.

1:11:28.375 --> 1:11:30.809
Goddammit.

1:11:32.942 --> 1:11:33.709
All right.

1:11:34.076 --> 1:11:35.709
Uh. We're gonna head downstairs
and when we get outside,

1:11:35.842 --> 1:11:38.009
- I'm taking him with me.
- Stay where you are!

1:11:38.142 --> 1:11:39.343
Jesus Christ, shut up!

1:11:43.142 --> 1:11:44.809
- Shit!
- What's happening?

1:11:45.042 --> 1:11:48.243
Don't these people need, like,
machines to breathe and shit?

1:11:48.675 --> 1:11:50.243
I swear to God,
what did you do, lady?

1:11:50.408 --> 1:11:51.309
It is just the lights.

1:11:51.709 --> 1:11:53.709
Backup generator takes care
of all the vital stuff.

1:11:53.976 --> 1:11:58.109
Now... ...we are going
to go down the hall,

1:11:58.243 --> 1:11:59.442
carry him down the stairs,

1:11:59.575 --> 1:12:00.876
and you can go out
the backdoor, okay?

1:12:00.976 --> 1:12:02.442
All right, but I'm taking
Regina with me.

1:12:02.575 --> 1:12:04.842
- Regina is staying here.
- No, she does not.

1:12:05.042 --> 1:12:09.042
That is the deal.
You get Andrew, I get Regina.

1:12:09.408 --> 1:12:11.343
You know,
I don't have time for this shit.

1:12:11.475 --> 1:12:15.142
Fine, fuck it, whatever.
You push him. Go!

1:12:18.809 --> 1:12:20.343
Wait, I wanna give him
a sedative.

1:12:20.475 --> 1:12:21.442
Why?

1:12:21.709 --> 1:12:23.309
So he doesn't wake up
in the middle of you

1:12:23.442 --> 1:12:24.642
operating on him.

1:12:29.109 --> 1:12:30.009
Fuck.

1:12:31.642 --> 1:12:34.009
- Fuck!
- You got this?

1:12:34.709 --> 1:12:36.475
Yeah. Yeah.

1:12:38.408 --> 1:12:39.909
Nurse, hurry up!

1:12:44.542 --> 1:12:46.142
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck is going on?

1:12:46.276 --> 1:12:47.909
- I'm nervous.
- Junkie.

1:12:56.042 --> 1:12:57.176
Oh, my fucking eye!

1:12:57.309 --> 1:12:59.076
- Go.
- Bitches!

1:12:59.542 --> 1:13:01.243
Why take Andrew? Leave him.

1:13:01.343 --> 1:13:02.976
I don't want him
taken away for organs.

1:13:03.076 --> 1:13:04.243
Why the fuck are you so nice

1:13:04.309 --> 1:13:05.609
to someone
who just treated you like shit?

1:13:05.709 --> 1:13:07.408
- You treat me like shit.
- We gotta go.

1:13:07.508 --> 1:13:08.909
- Hold on!
- Get up!

1:13:31.942 --> 1:13:34.742
- He's got my knife.
- Crazy cunts.

1:13:38.142 --> 1:13:39.209
I'm going out the front.

1:13:39.343 --> 1:13:42.009
I can't do that,
they got cops outside.

1:13:42.343 --> 1:13:43.909
Mandy?

1:13:44.176 --> 1:13:45.076
Mandy?

1:13:45.442 --> 1:13:46.942
Did you hear that noise,
what the fuck is going on?

1:13:47.276 --> 1:13:48.209
Janet, run!

1:13:51.742 --> 1:13:53.842
Goddammit.

1:13:56.475 --> 1:13:57.709
Sorry, ma'am.

1:13:59.375 --> 1:14:00.876
Go in that room
and lock the door.

1:14:01.042 --> 1:14:01.942
Go!

1:14:09.209 --> 1:14:10.375
Shit.

1:14:10.508 --> 1:14:12.142
Someone turned out
my nightlight.

1:14:12.276 --> 1:14:13.375
What is happening here?

1:14:13.475 --> 1:14:14.642
Do you know why the lights
went out?

1:14:14.742 --> 1:14:16.309
And is this blood on the floor?

1:14:16.442 --> 1:14:18.009
Y'all just need to stay cool.

1:14:19.009 --> 1:14:20.009
Shit.

1:14:25.642 --> 1:14:28.042
You assholes took my eye!

1:14:29.575 --> 1:14:32.375
Janet, Janet.
Come on, come on.

1:14:34.042 --> 1:14:35.442
That's right, put your head up.

1:14:39.942 --> 1:14:41.109
What's going on?

1:14:42.942 --> 1:14:44.976
Okay, lift up
for one second, one second.

1:14:45.142 --> 1:14:46.575
Okay.

1:14:53.508 --> 1:14:56.775
No! That's my friend!
From church!

1:14:58.375 --> 1:15:00.142
Dammit.

1:15:00.575 --> 1:15:02.408
Get the fuck outta here!

1:15:02.542 --> 1:15:03.976
He's in there. Run.

1:15:04.575 --> 1:15:06.109
- Get the fuck over here!
- No!

1:15:06.209 --> 1:15:07.276
You think
you can just run away

1:15:07.375 --> 1:15:08.609
and I wouldn't catch you?

1:15:08.709 --> 1:15:09.809
Well, now I'm taking
both of y'all,

1:15:09.909 --> 1:15:11.775
you and the fucking
wheelchair boy.

1:15:11.909 --> 1:15:13.876
There's gotta be something
useful inside each of you,

1:15:14.042 --> 1:15:16.408
unless yours is blackened
from painkillers!

1:15:16.542 --> 1:15:17.809
Mikey, don't hurt her.

1:15:20.976 --> 1:15:24.475
Okay, y'all go!
Go, this ain't gonna last long.

1:15:26.009 --> 1:15:27.009
Run!

1:15:30.042 --> 1:15:31.442
Oh, shit.

1:16:06.742 --> 1:16:08.976
Oh, come on.

1:16:09.243 --> 1:16:10.909
What the fuck, ladies?

1:16:12.343 --> 1:16:13.976
I know you're out here
somewhere.

1:16:18.876 --> 1:16:20.909
Come on, bitches,
it's cold out here!

1:16:21.042 --> 1:16:22.375
Where you at?

1:16:23.709 --> 1:16:24.609
Woo.

1:16:25.542 --> 1:16:26.809
You out in that rain?

1:16:27.542 --> 1:16:29.408
Ooh, you better be running
in that rain!

1:16:29.575 --> 1:16:32.775
You better be singing
in that rain! Enjoying it!

1:16:34.209 --> 1:16:35.542
But I know you're not...

1:16:36.609 --> 1:16:38.408
not with all them cops
out there...

1:16:40.309 --> 1:16:41.542
'cause I may do some...

1:16:43.109 --> 1:16:44.408
illegal shit...

1:16:45.809 --> 1:16:48.809
but it ain't nothing
compared to you two lunatics.

1:16:51.375 --> 1:16:52.976
But I got plans for y'all.

1:16:58.842 --> 1:16:59.809
Mm.

1:17:00.976 --> 1:17:01.909
Spurt.

1:17:04.375 --> 1:17:05.642
Better come on out...

1:17:06.942 --> 1:17:09.675
'cause both y'all have
an appointment...

1:17:10.343 --> 1:17:12.842
to have all your little organs
taken outta

1:17:12.976 --> 1:17:14.408
your skinny little bodies!

1:17:33.642 --> 1:17:35.109
- He's dead.
- No.

1:17:43.709 --> 1:17:45.575
Are you a good witch
or bad witch?

1:17:48.209 --> 1:17:49.109
There cops out there?

1:17:49.375 --> 1:17:51.176
Yeah, and we'll scream
if you try anything.

1:17:51.343 --> 1:17:52.876
- No, you won't.
- Are you here to kill us?

1:17:52.976 --> 1:17:55.276
No. But I need your help
getting outta here.

1:17:55.508 --> 1:17:56.709
Mandy, do something, help me.

1:17:56.842 --> 1:17:59.309
No, you're a fucking psychopath.
This is all your fault.

1:17:59.475 --> 1:18:02.343
- It's yours.
- Just take her.

1:18:02.609 --> 1:18:05.642
Thank you kindly, ma'am.
She sure is a pretty one.

1:18:08.343 --> 1:18:12.375
Blonde hair and blue eyes.

1:18:25.009 --> 1:18:26.276
I wasn't gonna hurt her.

1:18:26.609 --> 1:18:28.575
I was just gonna use
her to get outta here.

1:18:28.775 --> 1:18:32.442
You better hurry up.

1:18:33.309 --> 1:18:36.542
- You girls are crazy.
- Go home, Regina.

1:18:37.176 --> 1:18:39.575
Get the fuck outta here.

1:18:40.542 --> 1:18:42.909
Is this gonna give me a disease?

1:18:43.309 --> 1:18:45.142
No, just go home.

1:18:46.309 --> 1:18:47.642
You can't wear that.

1:18:48.243 --> 1:18:49.508
Take it off.

1:18:50.742 --> 1:18:52.942
Am I... am I fired?

1:18:53.209 --> 1:18:54.109
Oh, yeah.

1:18:55.542 --> 1:18:57.709
Yeah. I... I won't tell no one.

1:18:58.909 --> 1:19:00.042
I know you won't.

1:19:11.542 --> 1:19:14.109
See you around, then, cuz.

1:19:16.209 --> 1:19:18.675
Yeah. See ya.

1:19:23.508 --> 1:19:25.142
<i>More on that in the next hour.</i>

1:19:25.609 --> 1:19:27.309
<i>Our top story this
morning concerns</i>

1:19:27.442 --> 1:19:29.508
<i>the three deaths reported
at the local hospital</i>

1:19:29.642 --> 1:19:32.408
<i>over night, with two additional
people in critical condition.</i>

1:19:32.942 --> 1:19:35.709
<i>What's now being considered
a combination of a suicide,</i>

1:19:35.876 --> 1:19:38.542
<i>a potential homicide,
and a freak accident</i>

1:19:38.742 --> 1:19:40.709
<i>is currently
under investigation.</i>

1:19:42.408 --> 1:19:43.575
<i>The police are
on the scene now,</i>

1:19:43.709 --> 1:19:46.276
<i>but due to the Y2K
preparation weekend,</i>

1:19:46.408 --> 1:19:48.309
<i>much of the police force
wasn't in the area</i>

1:19:48.475 --> 1:19:49.742
<i>when the events
began to unfold.</i>

1:19:49.876 --> 1:19:51.642
<i>But the official statement
from the chief</i>

1:19:52.009 --> 1:19:53.575
<i>is that the delays
in police arrival</i>

1:19:53.742 --> 1:19:55.309
<i>did not contribute
to additional...</i>

1:19:55.475 --> 1:19:56.876
<i>...deaths and injuries.</i>

1:19:58.542 --> 1:19:59.709
<i>It's been a tragic year.</i>

1:19:59.842 --> 1:20:01.508
<i>We extend our condolences
to the families</i>

1:20:01.675 --> 1:20:04.076
<i>of those injured or killed
in the hospital last night.</i>

1:20:04.642 --> 1:20:05.876
<i>The investigation
is still open,</i>

1:20:06.009 --> 1:20:08.542
<i>but we've been informed
that the area is secure.</i>

1:20:08.675 --> 1:20:10.942
<i>We'll be hearing more
from the police later today.</i>

1:20:33.675 --> 1:20:38.209
I told Officer Myers all that.
And he said I was free to leave.

1:20:40.542 --> 1:20:43.508
I was real sad
about Mr. Collins.

1:20:44.709 --> 1:20:47.575
He just couldn't handle
being here anymore.

1:20:47.709 --> 1:20:52.542
No one deserves to go that way,
but I... I think it was suicide.

1:20:52.775 --> 1:20:56.775
Uh, uh. Sir,
you are not listening to me.

1:20:57.176 --> 1:20:58.076
He was a madman.

1:20:58.309 --> 1:20:59.675
He... he clearly killed
all these people.

1:20:59.775 --> 1:21:01.809
I mean, what kind
of hospital is this?

1:21:01.976 --> 1:21:04.176
Ma'am, uh,
can I get you a drink of water?

1:21:04.375 --> 1:21:06.475
- Yes, you can!
- You wanna come with me?

1:21:10.408 --> 1:21:12.709
She's right. He was crazy.

1:21:14.775 --> 1:21:16.408
We may have some
more questions for you,

1:21:16.575 --> 1:21:18.375
but I think I've got
all your information,

1:21:18.542 --> 1:21:19.942
so you should be okay.

1:21:35.243 --> 1:21:37.709
- Is everybody dead?
- No.

1:21:39.276 --> 1:21:41.109
Janet may not be able
to talk for a while,

1:21:41.243 --> 1:21:43.575
but that cute cop
ain't doing so good.

1:21:44.775 --> 1:21:47.642
- Cute ones always die.
- You mind helping?

1:21:49.109 --> 1:21:50.642
My shift just ended.

1:21:51.375 --> 1:21:52.775
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1:21:54.475 --> 1:21:56.276
Don't you dare touch her.

1:21:56.709 --> 1:21:59.442
I don't want anyone
in this hospital near her!

1:22:00.142 --> 1:22:01.176
Are you going home?

1:22:01.909 --> 1:22:05.042
No, they want me to stay
until things get settled.

1:22:05.508 --> 1:22:07.375
That's a long shift for you.

1:22:07.675 --> 1:22:09.642
Yeah, well,
I'm getting overtime.

1:22:11.809 --> 1:22:16.742
- Uh... I'll see you later.
- Yeah, see ya.

1:22:23.976 --> 1:22:24.909
How you doing?

1:22:26.575 --> 1:22:28.076
That was very strange.

1:22:28.575 --> 1:22:30.976
Why is this so small?
And this so big?

1:22:31.243 --> 1:22:33.575
Who's gonna do something
with these bags that I found?

1:22:33.709 --> 1:22:34.775
Who's gonna help me with this?

1:22:35.109 --> 1:22:37.575
Someone gonna do something
with these bags that I found?

1:22:38.243 --> 1:22:39.309
I found this one,

1:22:39.442 --> 1:22:41.309
looks like they're
chock-full of organ meat.

1:22:41.508 --> 1:22:43.309
I found this
at the soda machine.

1:22:43.575 --> 1:22:44.775
I went down for a nice drink

1:22:44.876 --> 1:22:46.775
and then I went down
again later,

1:22:46.876 --> 1:22:48.276
'cause no one's seen me
for a while,

1:22:48.343 --> 1:22:49.542
and then I found this one.

1:22:50.042 --> 1:22:51.942
It looks like someone
was keeping them there.

1:22:52.508 --> 1:22:54.009
Oh, oh, now you're gonna
pay attention.

1:22:54.109 --> 1:22:55.909
- Got the organs in my hands.
- Whoa, whoa.

1:22:56.009 --> 1:22:56.909
Okay, thank you.

1:22:57.109 --> 1:22:59.709
This has about seven
or eight different ones inside.

1:22:59.909 --> 1:23:02.508
Yeah, and I had... I kept
the soda far away, it's fine.

1:23:02.575 --> 1:23:04.209
I'm a little dizzy.
You need to be very careful

1:23:04.276 --> 1:23:05.408
with your hands.
