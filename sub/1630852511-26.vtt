36:30.977 --> 36:32.745
- No, I'm done.

36:32.745 --> 36:34.680
- Vinny came through,
embodied it,

36:34.680 --> 36:36.716
but I don't think it
was enough, fellas.

36:36.716 --> 36:37.984

I think you've got

to do some type of post
or something like that.

36:47.093 --> 36:49.395
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey!

36:49.395 --> 36:50.997
- No, no, no.

36:50.997 --> 36:53.432
- We had a heavy wager
on the "Wild 'N Out" game.

36:53.432 --> 36:56.869
So Vinny lost, and he has to
own up to his part of the bet.

36:56.869 --> 36:58.371
And what that was is,
Vinny had to post

36:58.371 --> 37:01.641
a picture of him and Angelina
on his Instagram.

37:01.641 --> 37:03.810
If I win, you're gonna do
an appreciation post

Don't move your lips.

I'll probably be crying.
