SCULLY: - What am I hearing, Mulder?

04:03.428 --> 04:04.927
According to eyewitnesses--

04:04.963 --> 04:07.029
or "earwitnesses,"
as it were--

04:07.065 --> 04:09.031
it sounded like
trumpets playing.

04:09.067 --> 04:11.367
From nowhere in particular?

04:11.402 --> 04:13.236
No apparent source.

04:13.271 --> 04:15.238
Music as if from the
heavens themselves,

04:15.273 --> 04:17.974
as if God himself
was making music,

04:18.009 --> 04:19.875
blowing his own horn.

04:19.911 --> 04:22.043
Since when do you believe
in God, Mulder?

04:22.079 --> 04:23.312
What makes you think I do?

04:23.348 --> 04:25.214
- "God himself"?
- I speak merely

04:25.250 --> 04:26.949
as an investigator.
Reports from Belarus

04:26.985 --> 04:30.620
to Canada, France, Italy,
Germany, the Ukraine...

04:30.655 --> 04:31.754
But as an investigator,

04:31.789 --> 04:33.055
you seem to give
this phenomenon credibility.

04:33.091 --> 04:35.057
It's not important
what <i> I</i> believe, Scully.

04:35.093 --> 04:36.726
It's important
what they believe.

04:36.761 --> 04:37.827
The earwitnesses.

04:37.862 --> 04:39.395
And what do they believe?

04:39.430 --> 04:42.198
"And I saw the seven angels
that stood before God,

04:42.233 --> 04:44.700
and to them were
given seven trumpets."

04:44.736 --> 04:45.701
Revelations 8:2.

04:45.737 --> 04:47.370
A herald of end times.

04:47.405 --> 04:48.704
You know
that prophecies like this

04:48.740 --> 04:49.939
have been going on
for centuries.

04:49.974 --> 04:52.141
Failed prognostications
of doom,

04:52.176 --> 04:53.643
failed prophecy,
even in the Bible.

04:53.678 --> 04:54.877
Yeah, God told Adam

04:54.913 --> 04:56.913
that if he ate the
forbidden fruit he'd die,

04:56.948 --> 04:57.880
and he lived 930 years.

04:57.916 --> 04:59.548
Top that.

04:59.584 --> 05:01.117
You know that didn't
literally happen, right?

05:01.152 --> 05:02.084
I'm just sayin'.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.352
It's your book.

05:03.388 --> 05:04.987
- (knocking on door)
MAN: - Hello?

05:05.023 --> 05:06.522
Anyone down here?

05:06.557 --> 05:08.224
Nobody but
the FBI's Most Unwanted.

05:08.259 --> 05:11.294
- I've been waiting 23 years to say that.
- How'd it feel?

05:11.329 --> 05:12.395
- Pretty good.
- Yeah?

05:12.430 --> 05:13.696
It's open. Come on in.

05:16.067 --> 05:17.733
- Special Agent Fox Mulder?
- Speaking.

05:17.769 --> 05:19.802
And to whom
am I speaking?

05:19.837 --> 05:21.804
I'm Special Agent Miller.
This is Special Agent Einstein.

05:21.839 --> 05:24.674
You're Special
Agent Einstein?

05:24.709 --> 05:27.710
I claim a distant relation,
if that's what you're referring to.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.312
For-forgive Agent Scully's
impertinence.

05:29.347 --> 05:31.514
She wrote her dissertation

05:31.549 --> 05:33.849
- on Einstein's twin paradox.
- Excuse me,

05:33.885 --> 05:36.686
but I was definitely told
you were a medical doctor.

05:36.721 --> 05:39.121
I am.
But I'm also a scientist.

05:39.157 --> 05:40.156
Because I'm a
medical doctor.

05:40.191 --> 05:43.092
- Oh.
- And you're a profiler,

05:43.127 --> 05:44.961
- obsessed with the paranormal?
- That's why we're here, actually.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.996
When we should be
at the airport.

05:47.031 --> 05:50.633
You both heard about the terrorist
bombing of an art gallery in Texas.

05:50.668 --> 05:52.301
Yes. Two young Muslim men

05:52.337 --> 05:54.003
protesting the depiction of
Mohammed.

05:54.038 --> 05:55.571
- Wearing suicide bomber vests.
- Can we get

05:55.606 --> 05:57.573
- to the business section, please?
- Nine people killed

05:57.608 --> 05:59.909
in the act but one
of the bombers survived.

05:59.944 --> 06:01.978
EINSTEIN: Technically.

06:02.013 --> 06:03.546
Medically, he's in a
persistent vegetative state.

06:03.581 --> 06:05.581
He's dead
except for a heartbeat.

06:05.616 --> 06:06.849
You must imagine why we're here.

06:06.884 --> 06:08.117
There have been
so-called practitioners...

06:08.152 --> 06:09.685
SCULLY:
I'm sorry. Forgive me,

06:09.721 --> 06:11.687
but I can't imagine
why you're here.

06:11.723 --> 06:12.788
That would make two of us.

06:12.824 --> 06:14.056
Agent Miller,

06:14.092 --> 06:15.391
a man with a mind

06:15.426 --> 06:17.560
obviously open to possibility

06:17.595 --> 06:20.129
would like to communicate
with the dead, or the near-dead,

06:20.164 --> 06:22.064
- as the case may be.
- I believe

06:22.100 --> 06:24.066
he may have intel
on a larger sleeper cell

06:24.102 --> 06:26.569
with an aim to commit
more acts of terror.

06:26.604 --> 06:28.137
Which is where our energy
would be better spent,

06:28.172 --> 06:29.805
trying to stop
live terrorists

06:29.841 --> 06:32.074
rather than stopping to try
to speak with dead ones.

06:32.110 --> 06:33.309
I have to say I agree.

06:33.344 --> 06:34.844
There have been
noted divinators,

06:34.879 --> 06:36.512
oracles, fakirs, necromancers

06:36.547 --> 06:38.114
who have claimed the ability...

06:38.149 --> 06:39.515
Madame Blavatsky,
founder of Theosophism,

06:39.550 --> 06:41.417
brought to America
a so-called

06:41.452 --> 06:43.986
Ancient Wisdom gained
from Tibetan spiritual adepts.

06:44.022 --> 06:45.855
Maybe I've been part
of the X-Files too long,

06:45.890 --> 06:48.024
but I happen to know
that Madame Blavatsky's dead.

06:48.059 --> 06:48.924
- Huh.
- Which would make it

06:48.960 --> 06:49.925
that much harder to glean

06:49.961 --> 06:51.460
her far-flung abilities.

06:51.496 --> 06:53.362
Yeah. That's what I thought.
Miller?

06:53.398 --> 06:55.364
You know of no such practitioner
working now

06:55.400 --> 06:57.066
whom we might consult?

06:57.101 --> 06:58.467
None that I'd waste
your time on.

06:58.503 --> 07:00.669
Miller, come on.
There's a 1:30 flight to Texas,

07:00.705 --> 07:01.937
and I want to be on it.

07:03.274 --> 07:04.874
Thank you for your time.

07:04.909 --> 07:07.309
Uh, please call me
when you think of something.

07:10.481 --> 07:13.916
He seemed
like a bright young man.

07:13.951 --> 07:15.918
She calls him "Miller."

07:17.155 --> 07:19.555
Hmm.

07:19.590 --> 07:21.557
Using artwork to
desecrate the prophet

07:21.592 --> 07:25.227
of someone else's religion just
incites fanatical terrorists.

07:25.263 --> 07:26.896
- It's just a painting.
- Yeah.

07:26.931 --> 07:28.230
Of Mohammed sitting on a toilet

07:28.266 --> 07:29.965
defecating radical Islamists!

07:30.001 --> 07:31.500
WOMAN: Do you know how absurd
this all is?

07:31.536 --> 07:32.601
It's just absurd!

07:32.637 --> 07:34.036
MAN: It's not
absurd to the victims

07:34.072 --> 07:36.238
of this action and their
families...

07:36.274 --> 07:38.974
Wearing that vest,
those last few steps,

07:39.010 --> 07:42.645
knowing you're gonna die,
must be so strange.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.581
How 'bout the victims?
Imagine not knowing.

07:45.616 --> 07:48.284
That's even worse.

07:48.319 --> 07:50.186
Where does all
the hate come from?

07:50.221 --> 07:52.021
He's just a kid.
A kid needs to be taught

07:52.056 --> 07:54.323
this hate.
You wonder who got in his head.

07:54.358 --> 07:57.093
Well, he's not
gonna tell you, Miller.

07:57.128 --> 07:58.828
And neither is any necromancer.

07:58.863 --> 08:01.097
- Well, wasn't it at least worth a try?
- (scoffs)

08:01.132 --> 08:03.265
You think anyone takes
the X-Files seriously?

08:03.301 --> 08:06.102
That's why they got them stuck
down in that basement office.

08:06.137 --> 08:08.003
I pity that poor Agent Scully.

08:08.039 --> 08:09.405
That's, like,
my dream assignment.

08:09.440 --> 08:10.940
No self-respecting scientist

08:10.975 --> 08:12.608
would spend a career
toiling away

08:12.643 --> 08:15.144
in obscure realms
of science fiction.

08:15.179 --> 08:16.178
Why else would she do it?

08:16.214 --> 08:17.913
She's clearly in love with him.

08:17.949 --> 08:19.582
You spent all of
five minutes with them.

08:19.617 --> 08:21.250
How do you know that?

08:21.285 --> 08:24.420
Nothing else would explain it.

08:24.455 --> 08:27.423
Maybe he values her open mind.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.425
Maybe she challenges his BS.

08:29.460 --> 08:32.495
(phone ringing)

08:32.530 --> 08:33.429
(sighs heavily)

08:33.464 --> 08:35.431
Special Agent Miller speaking.

08:35.466 --> 08:38.200
Agent Miller,
this is Agent Scully.

08:38.236 --> 08:40.669
Um, hey. One second.

08:40.705 --> 08:42.037
I'll meet you
on the plane.

08:42.073 --> 08:43.172
MAN (on TV):
...Westboro Church,

08:43.207 --> 08:44.840
the best representative
of all Christians!

08:44.876 --> 08:46.175
(woman shouting in response
to man, indistinctly)

08:46.210 --> 08:47.409
Hi.

08:47.445 --> 08:49.512
- You might wonder why I'm calling.
- No.

08:49.547 --> 08:52.615
- Uh, well, actually, yeah.
- I was thinking

08:52.650 --> 08:55.518
about your case,
and I have an idea

08:55.553 --> 08:58.020
that might help you communicate
with your terrorist.

08:58.055 --> 09:00.089
That is good news.

09:00.124 --> 09:01.290
- What is it?
- There's something

09:01.325 --> 09:03.092
I'd like to try.

09:03.127 --> 09:05.361
- But I need to meet you in Texas.
- Okay. Yeah.

09:05.396 --> 09:06.829
That sounds great.

09:06.864 --> 09:09.365
(phone ringing)

09:11.702 --> 09:14.336
Special Agent Einstein speaking.

09:14.372 --> 09:16.272
Agent Einstein,
it's Agent Mulder.

09:16.307 --> 09:18.407
You must wonder why I'm calling.

09:18.442 --> 09:21.544
No. I'm completely baffled.

09:22.613 --> 09:24.246
I have an idea

09:24.282 --> 09:26.282
of how you might communicate
with your terrorist.

09:26.317 --> 09:31.353
Uh, I think it's Special Agent
Miller you're looking for.

09:31.389 --> 09:33.055
No, no.
I-I-I need to speak with you.

09:33.090 --> 09:35.057
I got your number
from AD Walter Skinner,

09:35.092 --> 09:36.759
who sings your praises,
by the way.

09:36.794 --> 09:38.194
Yes, I helped him

09:38.229 --> 09:41.197
with his migraines,
which he claims are due to you.

09:41.232 --> 09:45.401
In-in-in any case, I was hoping
I might impose upon you

09:45.436 --> 09:47.469
to delay your trip out to Texas.

09:47.505 --> 09:50.406
You can't just tell me now?

09:50.441 --> 09:52.875
- It requires some explanation.
- You do realize

09:52.910 --> 09:55.644
the clock is ticking
on this case, quite literally.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.479
I think it could save lives.

10:01.485 --> 10:03.485
Say no more.

10:03.521 --> 10:05.221
I'm on my way.

10:08.392 --> 10:09.625
Where are you going?

10:09.660 --> 10:10.993
I'm catching the crazy train.

10:11.028 --> 10:12.361
I'll see you down
in Texas, Miller.

10:12.396 --> 10:14.263
WOMAN (on TV):
When did radical Muslims become

10:14.298 --> 10:15.431
a protected class in America?

10:15.466 --> 10:17.066
MAN (on TV): When the
Founding Fathers signed

10:17.101 --> 10:19.468
- the Constitution-- that's when.
- The same document that's supposed

10:19.503 --> 10:21.389
to protect my freedom of speech.

10:21.390 --> 10:23.006
But not your freedom to hate!
What is wrong with you?

10:23.007 --> 10:24.338
It is not a freedom to hate!

10:24.339 --> 10:26.543
Why do you think these guys
are acting this way?

10:26.544 --> 10:29.311
Why do you think that guy
went up and shot five servicemen

10:29.347 --> 10:31.313
in Chattanooga?
Because they loved him?

10:31.349 --> 10:34.149
Because we treated him well?
Because we don't plaster

10:34.185 --> 10:37.620
their names as terrorists
all over the media? No!

10:37.655 --> 10:39.321
- Because we hate them.
- We do not hate them. I will not...

10:39.357 --> 10:43.092
No, we do not hate them.
And I will not allow for that.

10:43.127 --> 10:44.293
We are not going
to continue

10:44.328 --> 10:46.328
to spread lies
about a people...

10:49.738 --> 10:51.204
(knocking)

10:51.239 --> 10:54.841
Ah, come in, Agent Einstein.
Have a seat.

10:54.876 --> 10:56.976
I came here in good faith,
Agent Mulder,

10:57.012 --> 10:58.845
but lives are at stake.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.814
- I'm all about that.
- If there were

11:00.849 --> 11:02.649
another act of terror,
and I'm in here listening

11:02.684 --> 11:04.751
to some woo woo treatise
on the paranormal,

11:04.786 --> 11:06.519
I don't think I could
forgive myself.

11:06.555 --> 11:08.321
(stammering):
I-I don't do woo woo.

11:08.356 --> 11:10.323
Okay, what's your big idea?

11:10.358 --> 11:13.393
How are we going to talk
with this terrorist?

11:13.428 --> 11:14.561
Well, first, can we talk about

11:14.596 --> 11:16.329
the nature of reality,
as you perceive it?

11:16.364 --> 11:18.598
My reality is new chatter
on the Internet

11:18.633 --> 11:21.067
- about more suicide bombs.
- But do you believe

11:21.102 --> 11:22.702
that thoughts have mass?

11:22.737 --> 11:25.972
That ideas such as faith
and forgiveness have weight

11:26.007 --> 11:28.708
much the same way
this desk... has weight?

11:28.743 --> 11:29.976
Or any material, really.

11:30.011 --> 11:31.644
(wry laugh)

11:31.680 --> 11:33.479
You are too much,
Agent Mulder.

11:33.515 --> 11:34.848
It's a legitimate
question.

11:34.883 --> 11:36.883
There's a legitimate answer-- no.

11:36.918 --> 11:37.917
How can you be so sure?

11:37.953 --> 11:39.519
Because when I stand
on the scale

11:39.554 --> 11:42.388
and think of ice cream,
my ass doesn't grow.

11:42.424 --> 11:43.623
- Need I illustrate further?
- Yes,

11:43.658 --> 11:46.025
but I'm sure you believe
that words have weight--

11:46.061 --> 11:48.361
the weight to move people
to go kill other people.

11:48.396 --> 11:50.530
People kill people.
Bombs kill people.

11:50.565 --> 11:52.599
Words can incite people
to kill people

11:52.634 --> 11:55.869
as instruments of hate, but are
not lethal in and of themselves.

11:55.904 --> 11:58.037
Ever suck on a lemon,
Agent Einstein?

11:58.073 --> 11:59.739
Do you feel a sensation
right now?

11:59.774 --> 12:02.108
(sucking)
A quasi-measurable effect?

12:02.143 --> 12:06.746
I am getting a taste of what
Agent Scully must suffer.

12:06.781 --> 12:08.748
Neo-Darwinists believe
that every word spoken,

12:08.783 --> 12:11.618
every thought, every perception,
lest I misperceive,

12:11.653 --> 12:13.720
is a step in the evolution
of mankind.

12:13.755 --> 12:15.889
(chuckles): Yes. A butterfly
beats its wings in China,

12:15.924 --> 12:17.724
but that butterfly
won't be defusing explosives

12:17.759 --> 12:19.425
in any suicide vests.

12:19.461 --> 12:21.594
Agent Einstein, you have
a terrorist lying in a state

12:21.630 --> 12:23.496
of existence somewhere
between life and death.

12:23.531 --> 12:25.732
If he holds valuable intel
on other terrorists,

12:25.767 --> 12:28.401
maybe in order to reach him,
you need to expand your mind

12:28.436 --> 12:29.969
on the so-called material world.

12:37.946 --> 12:39.746
I got here
as fast as I could.

12:39.781 --> 12:41.814
Let me say, I'm blown
away you came down here

12:41.850 --> 12:43.917
- to help me at all.
- Well, I sensed your frustration.

12:43.952 --> 12:45.652
I just want to believe
there's some way

12:45.687 --> 12:47.954
of reaching this young man and
learning what he might know.

12:47.989 --> 12:50.423
Well, I believe there may be,
but not the way you think.

12:50.458 --> 12:51.824
What way is that,
Agent Scully?

12:51.860 --> 12:54.360
Well, not through an oracle
or a psychic or a seer,

12:54.396 --> 12:55.762
but through science.

12:55.797 --> 12:57.931
I don't know
how you mean.

12:57.966 --> 13:01.868
This may sound heavy, but
this is a bit of a personal quest for me.

13:01.903 --> 13:03.770
My mother was
in a coma recently,

13:03.805 --> 13:05.505
and I wasn't able to communicate

13:05.540 --> 13:06.606
with her, either.

13:06.641 --> 13:08.274
I take it she's passed?

13:08.310 --> 13:10.243
I wish I'd had
the presence of mind

13:10.278 --> 13:12.578
to think of this
when she was still alive.

13:12.614 --> 13:16.015
It might've solved a mystery
that I may never know.

13:18.453 --> 13:19.919
Please enlighten me,
Agent Mulder,

13:19.955 --> 13:21.754
how nine years of college,
three degrees,

13:21.790 --> 13:24.857
and two years at Quantico
has left me such a simpleton.

13:24.893 --> 13:25.725
Not a simpleton.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.193
A mugwump.

13:27.228 --> 13:28.695
I resent that characterization,

13:28.730 --> 13:30.930
and I don't even know
what it means.

13:30.966 --> 13:32.632
- It means sit down and shut up.
- (huffs)

13:32.667 --> 13:34.801
You talk to Agent Scully
like that?

13:34.836 --> 13:36.869
Only when she's being
a mugwump.

13:36.905 --> 13:39.172
Please...
have a seat.

13:42.711 --> 13:44.677
I'll give you two minutes,
Agent Mulder,

13:44.713 --> 13:46.713
and then I'm due back on Earth.

13:47.749 --> 13:50.049
- (sighs)
- Behold.

13:50.085 --> 13:52.118
<i>Psilocybe tampenensis.</i>

13:52.153 --> 13:53.953
I'm afraid where this is going.

13:53.989 --> 13:55.955
The so-called Magic Mushroom,
the study of which

13:55.991 --> 13:58.324
has begun anew by respected
medical practitioners

13:58.360 --> 14:00.860
- from Columbia University to Oxford.
- (groans, chuckles)

14:00.895 --> 14:03.196
- Highly contested studies.
- Highly uncontested results.

14:03.231 --> 14:06.799
Test subjects report
experiences that transcended

14:06.835 --> 14:08.801
space and time,
confrontations with the dead,

14:08.837 --> 14:11.004
- touching the very face of God.
- That's nice,

14:11.039 --> 14:13.673
Agent Mulder-- you've got
about a minute and counting.

14:13.708 --> 14:15.942
Test subjects have also reported
that once the impediment

14:15.977 --> 14:18.745
of the physical body is removed,
deep and lasting truths

14:18.780 --> 14:20.980
are revealed that
the conscious mind won't allow--

14:21.016 --> 14:24.484
feelings of ineffability,
sacredness, peace, unity,

14:24.519 --> 14:27.020
joy-- all without
altering brain chemistry.

14:27.055 --> 14:30.423
Are you proposing, Agent Mulder,
that we administer

14:30.458 --> 14:32.759
the Magic Mushroom
to the terrorist?

14:32.794 --> 14:34.027
No. No.

14:34.062 --> 14:36.362
I am proposing that
you administer it to me,

14:36.398 --> 14:38.398
so that I can communicate
with the terrorist,

14:38.433 --> 14:40.733
learn what he knows, and prevent
future acts of terror.

14:40.769 --> 14:42.535
To a technically dead man?

14:42.570 --> 14:44.137
Death is now viewed by some

14:44.172 --> 14:45.805
as merely another plane
of existence.

14:45.840 --> 14:48.141
I don't think our terrorist
has even achieved that plane.

14:48.176 --> 14:50.243
I believe he's still reachable
on <i> this</i> plane.

14:51.713 --> 14:54.981
So you called me back here to
ask me to administer this drug,

14:55.016 --> 14:56.649
this illicit
Schedule 1 substance.

14:56.684 --> 14:58.651
As a medical professional.

14:58.686 --> 15:00.987
Which Agent Scully is as well.

15:01.022 --> 15:02.555
Agent Scully has recently had

15:02.590 --> 15:03.923
her own life-altering
death experience,

15:03.958 --> 15:06.159
and I don't want
to bother her with this.

15:06.194 --> 15:07.660
Oh.

15:07.695 --> 15:10.163
Oh, so you want
to just keep it between us?

15:10.198 --> 15:11.931
I-I would, if you don't mind.

15:11.966 --> 15:13.166
No.

15:13.201 --> 15:15.601
No, I wouldn't mind at all.

15:15.637 --> 15:17.603
Because there will be
absolutely nothing to say,

15:17.639 --> 15:20.106
except maybe to Internal
Affairs, if I were to go through

15:20.141 --> 15:22.408
- with this lunatic scheme of yours.
- What is lunatic

15:22.444 --> 15:24.610
- about it, exactly?
- Oh, let me think about that. Everything?

15:25.747 --> 15:27.013
And rest assured, Agent Mulder,

15:27.048 --> 15:28.948
when I walk out of here,
I will never again

15:28.983 --> 15:30.416
darken your basement door.

15:33.121 --> 15:35.688
So that's a maybe?

15:35.723 --> 15:38.057
(monitor beeping steadily)

15:39.694 --> 15:41.127
It's hard to imagine
there's someone in there,

15:41.162 --> 15:42.128
when you really see him.

15:42.163 --> 15:44.530
Research bears out

15:44.566 --> 15:46.833
a surprising incidence
of electro-activity

15:46.868 --> 15:49.402
even in the most
severely brain-damaged.

15:49.437 --> 15:52.071
What I want to try
is a rather... novel

15:52.107 --> 15:54.173
but not untested protocol.

15:54.209 --> 15:56.075
I'm open to whatever.

15:56.111 --> 15:58.010
I'm certain that you are,
Agent Miller.

15:58.046 --> 15:59.846
I believe so many answers
lie beyond the pale

15:59.881 --> 16:01.080
of the known world in realms

16:01.116 --> 16:02.748
of extreme
possibility.

16:02.784 --> 16:05.051
I believe that you believe.

16:05.086 --> 16:06.586
So what are you proposing?

16:06.621 --> 16:08.554
Doctors recently achieved
the ability to communicate

16:08.590 --> 16:10.756
with a man known
as Patient 23

16:10.792 --> 16:12.758
through magnetic
imaging-- MRI--

16:12.794 --> 16:15.728
by prompting
his otherwise inert

16:15.763 --> 16:18.564
and unresponsive brain
with questions

16:18.600 --> 16:21.234
- that triggered electro-activity.
- What kind of questions?

16:21.269 --> 16:24.337
Mundane questions about...
housekeeping and tennis.

16:24.372 --> 16:27.373
But they unexpectedly lit up
certain regions of his brain

16:27.408 --> 16:30.443
that translated
to yes-and-no responses.

16:30.478 --> 16:32.011
That is incredible.

16:32.046 --> 16:34.046
Well, more incredibly,
it can be achieved rather simply

16:34.082 --> 16:36.716
through the use of an ordinary
electro-encephalogram.

16:36.751 --> 16:37.950
Why didn't someone
think of that?

16:37.986 --> 16:39.585
But let me caution you.

16:39.621 --> 16:41.554
Even if we do reach
this young man,

16:41.589 --> 16:42.889
it may be difficult

16:42.924 --> 16:46.559
to get the intel
that you're hoping for.

16:46.594 --> 16:47.894
MALE AGENT:
Who's Special Agent Miller?

16:47.929 --> 16:49.562
I'm Special Agent Miller.

16:49.597 --> 16:51.397
Gonna ask you
to leave.

16:51.432 --> 16:53.065
FBI has no more
jurisdiction here.

16:53.101 --> 16:54.200
Who has jurisdiction?

16:54.235 --> 16:55.401
Department of Homeland Security.

16:55.436 --> 16:57.336
I was assigned this case.
Agent Scully

16:57.372 --> 16:58.371
is a medical doctor.

16:58.406 --> 16:59.772
We think we can
communicate...

16:59.807 --> 17:01.107
Communicate?
To say what?

17:01.142 --> 17:02.441
"You shouldn't
have done it, son"?

17:02.477 --> 17:03.910
There's a chance to
question him about

17:03.945 --> 17:05.377
- who was behind the bombing.
- And you think

17:05.413 --> 17:06.479
he's gonna tell you?

17:06.513 --> 17:08.146
By any moral
definition,

17:08.183 --> 17:10.316
this body here isn't a human.

17:10.351 --> 17:12.451
By my definition,
this terrorist is dead.

17:12.487 --> 17:14.053
I'm sorry,
but what's your business here?

17:14.088 --> 17:16.189
I suggest that
you both take a little breather

17:16.223 --> 17:17.589
and call your superiors
in Washington,

17:17.625 --> 17:18.657
if you have any questions.

17:18.693 --> 17:19.791
We're not leaving this room.

17:22.096 --> 17:25.064
(speaking quietly
in Arabic)

17:25.098 --> 17:27.032
MILLER:
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

17:27.068 --> 17:28.334
I'll give the orders,
Agent Miller.

17:28.368 --> 17:30.002
Wrong. I'm giving
the orders now.

17:30.038 --> 17:31.571
They've come here
for retribution.

17:31.606 --> 17:32.905
Whoever you're calling,
this goes way beyond...

17:32.941 --> 17:34.440
I'm not calling anyone.

17:34.475 --> 17:35.975
(clicking)

17:38.479 --> 17:40.379
Special Agent Einstein.

17:40.415 --> 17:43.015
I'm sorry, but I can't let you
in there without authorization.

17:43.051 --> 17:45.017
I've been assigned
this case

17:45.053 --> 17:46.352
with my partner,
Special Agent Miller.

17:51.492 --> 17:53.059
Let me see that.

17:53.094 --> 17:54.460
(clears throat)
If you're his partner,

17:54.495 --> 17:57.196
then who is
Special Agent Dana Scully?

18:11.079 --> 18:13.312
(line ringing)

18:13.348 --> 18:14.981
Agent Mulder,
it's Agent Einstein.

18:15.016 --> 18:17.216
How soon can you be in Texas?

18:20.900 --> 18:25.302
(jet airliner taking off,
engines whooshing)

18:25.338 --> 18:27.872
(indistinct announcement
over PA system)

18:36.349 --> 18:37.381
Agent Mulder.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.086
Agent Einstein.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.888
For a second there,
I thought

18:43.923 --> 18:46.423
- you were gonna punk me.
- I had a little trouble,

18:46.459 --> 18:49.927
- uh, procuring... the illicit substance.
- Oh.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.232
- Where'd you get these?
- Apparently, Texas is something

18:55.268 --> 18:56.934
of a promised land--
as it turns out,

18:56.969 --> 18:58.802
one of the early research
pioneers is from here.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.471
So this is the real deal, huh?

19:00.506 --> 19:02.039
I can't speak
to the dosage,

19:02.074 --> 19:03.908
and I certainly
wouldn't take both.

19:03.943 --> 19:06.410
- Not till you've experienced the one.
- May I ask,

19:06.445 --> 19:08.045
Agent Einstein,
what changed your mind

19:08.080 --> 19:09.480
on this whole deal here?

19:09.515 --> 19:13.384
I got here to find that
Agent Scully was here in Texas

19:13.419 --> 19:14.952
working with Agent Miller.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.921
I sense some
professional animus.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.455
- Nothing professional about it.
- But you think

19:18.491 --> 19:21.191
- this misguided.
- My loss is your gain,

19:21.227 --> 19:22.526
Agent Mulder.

19:22.561 --> 19:24.728
I'll deal with Agent Miller
about this later.

19:24.764 --> 19:27.364
In the meantime,
we must conduct this business

19:27.400 --> 19:29.300
with a certain delicacy

19:29.335 --> 19:31.802
where the consumption
of any potentially dangerous

19:31.837 --> 19:34.271
and psychotropic hallucinogen
must be undertaken

19:34.307 --> 19:36.340
outside of a laboratory.

19:36.375 --> 19:39.243
You mean hide it like a
couple of drug addicts.

19:39.278 --> 19:43.414
While this may seem foolhardy,
I <i> am</i> anticipating results,

19:43.449 --> 19:44.982
that you will
actually be

19:45.017 --> 19:48.152
communicating
with the terrorist, somehow.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.087
Now, what he
may say to you,

19:50.122 --> 19:52.823
or you to him, I have no clue.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.898
How do you say "Howdy, pardner"
in Arabic?

20:08.975 --> 20:10.474
Thank you.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.776
You Agent Einstein?

20:12.812 --> 20:15.346
No, I'm Agent Dana Scully.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.714
Agent Miller?

20:16.749 --> 20:18.515
- Yes. Is there a problem?
- I'm Special Agent Brem,

20:18.551 --> 20:20.517
here to inform you that this
hospital is under terror threat.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.119
I've got a cordon of agents
near the building

20:22.154 --> 20:23.988
as a precaution against
an attack, but I need

20:24.023 --> 20:26.690
to clear this wing until
we can bring in the bomb squad.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.858
You know where
the threat came from?

20:27.893 --> 20:29.126
Mm-mm. An anonymous caller,

20:29.161 --> 20:31.061
but... a very clear guess--

20:31.097 --> 20:34.832
there's a large and...
unassimilated Muslim community

20:34.867 --> 20:36.800
in the area, with
one shared wish.

20:36.836 --> 20:37.901
One shared wish that what?

20:37.937 --> 20:39.503
To wipe you and America
off the map.

20:39.538 --> 20:42.039
To honor their hero,
Osama bin Laden,

20:42.074 --> 20:43.474
whose picture we find
all too frequently

20:43.509 --> 20:45.609
on their refrigerators.

20:45.644 --> 20:47.978
Not all Muslims
are extremists, certainly.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.446
Feel free to stay here
and take your chances,

20:49.482 --> 20:50.647
if you don't believe me.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.316
There are other people who want

20:52.351 --> 20:53.751
to see this young man dead.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.819
I'm not one of them,
Agent Miller.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.688
Last thing I want
is for this...

20:57.723 --> 21:00.624
killer to die and go to
paradise or to his 72 virgins...

21:00.659 --> 21:02.092
- (scoffs)
- ...in the sky.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.028
(quietly):
Sounds like torture to me.

21:04.063 --> 21:05.596
This boy can hear
everything you're saying,

21:05.631 --> 21:08.399
and we're trying to win
his trust and talk to him.

21:09.668 --> 21:11.769
Keep the killer alive.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.737
You do your job; we'll do ours.

21:19.378 --> 21:21.378
BREM:
Time to evacuate.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.513
Everybody out!

21:30.122 --> 21:32.423
(monitor beeping steadily)

21:51.143 --> 21:53.477
(monitor beeping,
respirator hissing)

22:03.722 --> 22:06.090
(alarm beeping)

22:06.125 --> 22:08.459
(quiet guttural gasping)

22:10.196 --> 22:11.662
(flatline tone,
alarm beeping rapidly)

22:20.106 --> 22:21.872
(flatline tone,
alarm beeping rapidly)

22:27.513 --> 22:29.880
(alarm stops, then four beeps;
respirator hisses)

22:31.317 --> 22:33.550
There's, uh...
there's been

22:33.586 --> 22:35.953
a bomb threat.
They're asking us to leave.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.122
Uh, we have special
authorization.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.356
- That's what everyone says.
- No.

22:39.391 --> 22:40.958
We'll just need the room

22:40.993 --> 22:42.493
for a few minutes...
to do research.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.194
Yeah, that's what
everyone says.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.529
You know, I've never seen

22:45.564 --> 22:47.231
a patient receive
so much attention...

22:47.266 --> 22:51.034
especially one who's
so unworthy of it.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.470
- Well, this is a special case.
- Just like all those

22:53.506 --> 22:56.206
immigrant groups coming
over here, taking all our jobs,

22:56.242 --> 22:59.143
clogging up the health
care system and our schools,

22:59.178 --> 23:00.677
and they don't
even speak English.

23:00.713 --> 23:04.248
We're not gonna
fix that right now, so...

23:04.283 --> 23:06.984
A church group brought
200 Arab refugees

23:07.019 --> 23:08.485
to our town, and now

23:08.521 --> 23:10.387
they're saying that
they want to bring some more.

23:10.422 --> 23:11.688
Maybe we need to come back.

23:12.691 --> 23:14.057
Or maybe...

23:14.093 --> 23:15.726
we can talk outside.

23:15.761 --> 23:17.895
NURSE: It's all part of a
government program paid for

23:17.930 --> 23:20.597
by my tax dollars, which means
that I come to work every day,

23:20.633 --> 23:22.466
and I pay for
these people...

23:30.376 --> 23:32.643
(monitor beeping,
respirator hissing)

23:35.381 --> 23:38.515
(sighing)

23:38.551 --> 23:40.250
So I did some research,

23:40.286 --> 23:42.920
and I found out that
this is all part of a plot

23:42.955 --> 23:45.556
by the United Nations to get
these people into the US,

23:45.591 --> 23:47.391
so that they can form
terrorist cells.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.092
- That sounds very suspicious.
- Yeah.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.028
You turn your back
on these people,

23:51.063 --> 23:52.462
- you're taking your chance.
- No.

23:52.498 --> 23:54.831
No, we don't want
to turn our backs.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.733
One more thing-- you say
you're here doing research?

23:56.769 --> 23:59.469
Yes. We'll just be
a few more minutes in the room,

23:59.505 --> 24:01.471
- and then we'll be evacuating, as well.
- Yeah.

24:01.507 --> 24:04.641

aberrant neurological activity,
not a response in and of itself.

28:30.584 --> 28:31.950
- How do we know the difference?
- Well,

28:31.986 --> 28:34.653
we need to set up a baseline,
set up questions

28:34.689 --> 28:35.954
that serve as yes-no answers.

28:35.990 --> 28:38.991
It will be painstaking

- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

29:01.182 --> 29:02.448
Dude, I was on fire.

29:02.483 --> 29:03.549
Dude,

29:03.584 --> 29:05.117
you were an embarrassment,

29:05.153 --> 29:07.353
to me and to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

29:07.388 --> 29:10.456
A-Agent Einstein?
Agent Einstein, tell him.

29:10.491 --> 29:12.124
Tell him what,
Agent Mulder?

29:12.160 --> 29:14.460
What were were doing was
under your medical supervision,

29:14.495 --> 29:16.929
- all on the up and up.
- It was until it wasn't.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.797
Well, it's not like
it was volitional.

29:18.833 --> 29:19.999
What was it, Agent Mulder?

29:20.034 --> 29:22.234
It was the Magic Mushrooms.

29:22.270 --> 29:23.669
Maybe I took too much.

29:23.704 --> 29:25.237
Maybe you didn't take enough.

29:25.273 --> 29:27.006
What's that supposed to mean?

29:27.041 --> 29:29.241
Agent Einstein informed
me that you requested

29:29.277 --> 29:30.543
that she administer an
illicit substance to you

29:30.578 --> 29:31.877
in your rather reckless

29:31.913 --> 29:33.846
attempt to talk
to an alleged mass murderer.

29:33.881 --> 29:35.681
Yeah, and administer them
she did.

29:35.716 --> 29:38.450
These are what I gave you,
Agent Mulder.

29:38.486 --> 29:42.254
Yeah, that stuff--
that's potent.

29:42.290 --> 29:46.025
- This stuff is purchasable at any
corner drugstore. - Maybe in Texas it is.

29:46.060 --> 29:48.527
These are niacin capsules,
Agent Mulder.

29:48.563 --> 29:50.362
- What I gave you is a placebo.
- No way.

29:50.398 --> 29:51.864
No way. That's impossible.

29:51.899 --> 29:54.633
I-I was under the
influence of something...

29:54.669 --> 29:56.535
- powerful.
- Yes.

29:56.571 --> 29:57.870
The power of suggestion.

29:57.905 --> 30:01.607
No, you were there.

30:01.642 --> 30:04.543
And The Lone Gunman.

30:04.579 --> 30:06.345
- The Badonkadonk.
- Yeah, I was

30:06.380 --> 30:08.847
- in Washington, Agent Mulder.
- This is what I'm saying!

30:08.883 --> 30:10.282
I think he's
still tripping.

30:10.318 --> 30:11.784
Well, the placebo effect
has been known

30:11.819 --> 30:13.219
to have lasting
psychological outcome.

30:13.254 --> 30:14.687
I talked to the terrorist.

30:14.722 --> 30:16.522
- You talked to the terrorist?
- Yes.

30:16.557 --> 30:18.190
He whispered in my ear.

30:18.226 --> 30:19.692
Well, what did he say,
Agent Mulder?

30:19.727 --> 30:23.128
I can't tell you what he said.

30:23.164 --> 30:25.531
It was in Arabic.

30:25.566 --> 30:28.367
Well, I'm gonna get you
a wheelchair

30:28.402 --> 30:30.970
so we can get you home,
partner, all right?

30:34.275 --> 30:36.942
Well, you were there, too.

30:36.978 --> 30:39.211
And you were 50 shades of bad.

30:40.881 --> 30:43.349
You know this is ridiculous.

30:43.384 --> 30:44.717
We don't want you dancing away.

30:44.752 --> 30:47.253
So I did... I-I...
I did dance then?

30:47.288 --> 30:48.754
According to
a whole bunch

30:48.789 --> 30:50.756
of very frightened,
middle-aged Texans.

30:50.791 --> 30:52.558
(sighs)
You're just covering your ass.

30:52.593 --> 30:54.293
Well, either way.

30:54.328 --> 30:55.861
I'll be looking at
disciplinary action

30:55.896 --> 30:58.264
over my own dismal failure
of authority.

30:58.299 --> 31:00.666
Thanks to you, I'll probably
be banished to my own

31:00.701 --> 31:03.469
basement office, consigned to a
life of ridicule and ignominy...

31:03.504 --> 31:04.503
Stop!

31:04.538 --> 31:05.471
Stop.

31:05.506 --> 31:07.740
(woman pleading
in distance)

31:07.775 --> 31:09.675
WOMAN (in distance):
I'm begging you!

31:09.710 --> 31:11.677
I... I know this woman.

31:11.712 --> 31:13.612
It's okay.

31:20.955 --> 31:22.288
Maybe you haven't failed.

31:29.830 --> 31:31.297
Agent Scully.

31:33.601 --> 31:34.867
Miller.

31:36.237 --> 31:38.837
This is Noora.

31:38.873 --> 31:42.474
She's come here today
to talk to her son, Shiraz.

31:42.510 --> 31:44.910
Mulder, where did
you find her?

31:44.945 --> 31:46.378
Please don't ask him that.

31:51.485 --> 31:53.786
- (gasps)
- It's okay.

31:53.821 --> 31:55.321
(gasping)

31:55.356 --> 31:56.689
Got you.

31:59.327 --> 32:01.293
(crying)

32:01.329 --> 32:02.995
(speaking Arabic)

32:05.566 --> 32:08.067
We believe
that he can hear you.

32:08.102 --> 32:11.303
Then my prayers are answered.

32:11.339 --> 32:13.439
Oh.

32:14.775 --> 32:17.643
My beautiful baby boy, Shiraz.

32:17.678 --> 32:21.413
You could not
<i>ever</i> kill anyone.

32:21.449 --> 32:27.353
This is not how I raised you--
to worship Allah through death.

32:27.388 --> 32:30.756
To be a man by following men.

32:30.791 --> 32:33.692
Your heart is too
big for them.

32:33.728 --> 32:37.696
You see the faces
of the innocent,

32:37.732 --> 32:39.865
and you lose your nerves.

32:39.900 --> 32:42.067
You cannot go through
with the bomb.

32:42.103 --> 32:43.669
MULDER:
Noora,

32:43.704 --> 32:45.504
how do you know that?

32:46.841 --> 32:49.708
(sniffles)
Because my Shiraz

32:49.744 --> 32:51.110
tells me so...
(sniffles)

32:51.145 --> 32:53.812
in my dreams and in my prayers.

32:55.116 --> 32:56.448
Who filled his head, Noora?

32:57.818 --> 32:59.918
_

32:59.954 --> 33:02.921
(sniffling)
I do not know how to help you

33:02.957 --> 33:05.924
because I do not know
their names.

33:05.960 --> 33:08.293
- (alarm beeping)
- (Shiraz grunting)

33:08.329 --> 33:09.495
He's going into cardiac arrest.

33:09.530 --> 33:10.662
(flatline tone)

33:10.698 --> 33:11.463
SCULLY:
Blood pressure's dropping.

33:11.499 --> 33:12.865
I'm gonna go get help.

33:12.900 --> 33:14.366
No, no, I think
he's trying to tell us.

33:14.402 --> 33:15.968
(flatline tone continues)

33:16.003 --> 33:17.503
SCULLY:
Now we're losing him!

33:23.110 --> 33:24.476
Shiraz, please, please.

33:26.414 --> 33:27.713
I'm so sorry.

33:27.748 --> 33:29.515
No, Shiraz!
(crying)

33:29.550 --> 33:30.649
SCULLY: I'm sorry.

33:30.684 --> 33:32.484
(flatline tone, Noora sobbing)

33:32.520 --> 33:34.420
- Let's give her some space.
NOORA: - Oh, my Shiraz.

33:34.455 --> 33:36.088
- He talked to us.
- Oh, Shiraz.

33:36.123 --> 33:38.056
He talked to me.

33:40.094 --> 33:41.427
This is exactly how I saw it.

33:41.462 --> 33:43.729
Agent Mulder, please...

33:43.764 --> 33:45.264
He spoke to me.

33:45.299 --> 33:46.932
(crying):
Shiraz.

33:46.967 --> 33:48.834
He spoke to me.

33:51.636 --> 33:53.036
SCULLY: What do you mean
he spoke to you?

33:54.539 --> 33:55.938
Spoke to you when,
Agent Mulder?

33:55.974 --> 33:58.041
With the help
of Agent Einstein.

33:58.076 --> 33:59.609
Ugh, Agent Mulder, please stop.

33:59.644 --> 34:01.144
Mulder, when could he possibly
have spoken to you?

34:01.179 --> 34:03.446
I can explain.
Or I can't explain.

34:03.481 --> 34:05.381
He spoke to me. In Arabic.

34:05.417 --> 34:07.417
- In Arabic?
- In words I didn't understand, yeah.

34:07.452 --> 34:08.551
What words, Agent Mulder?

34:10.288 --> 34:13.322
(Shiraz speaking weakly)

34:13.358 --> 34:14.724
Babbel...

34:14.759 --> 34:17.126
Babeel...

34:17.161 --> 34:18.594
Bab-Babell.

34:20.565 --> 34:23.132
(whispers weakly)

34:23.168 --> 34:27.170
Babil? Babil al...

34:27.205 --> 34:28.304
something.

34:28.339 --> 34:29.972
"Babil" is
"Babylon," the city.

34:30.007 --> 34:32.074
Like in ancient Babylon?

34:32.110 --> 34:34.177
- Just... Babi..
- I feel like I need

34:34.212 --> 34:36.411
- to explain.
- Just let him finish, please.

34:36.447 --> 34:39.348
Babil al... Babil...

34:39.384 --> 34:40.917
Mulder, are you okay?

34:42.053 --> 34:45.955
(whispering weakly)

34:45.989 --> 34:48.858
<i>Funduq. Babil al funduq.</i>

34:50.128 --> 34:53.429
Babylon the hotel?

34:53.465 --> 34:55.331
(engines revving,
tires screeching)

35:00.872 --> 35:02.271
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

35:12.283 --> 35:14.117
(soldiers shouting,
distant and distorted)

36:23.955 --> 36:26.222
- I didn't really do anything.
- Ah.

36:26.257 --> 36:28.390
Nothing but take down
a terror cell

36:28.426 --> 36:30.693
ready to kill untold numbers.

36:30.728 --> 36:32.528
That was all Agent Mulder.

36:32.563 --> 36:35.397
That's not how I understand it.

36:35.433 --> 36:37.566
I'm told
you kept that boy alive,

36:37.602 --> 36:39.401
that you kept him

36:39.437 --> 36:40.703
safe from harm.

36:40.738 --> 36:42.238
I translated a few words.

36:42.273 --> 36:44.139
It was all you and Agent Mulder.

36:44.175 --> 36:45.140
(scoffing)

36:45.176 --> 36:49.311
Remarkably, I did nothing.

36:49.347 --> 36:52.381
And, remarkably, it worked.

36:52.416 --> 36:55.251
Although I'm at a loss
in explaining it.

36:55.286 --> 36:58.754
Maybe some things are unexplainable,
Agent Einstein.

36:58.789 --> 37:01.190
Mmm.

37:04.362 --> 37:07.563
The most beautiful thing
we can experience

37:07.598 --> 37:09.265
is the mysterious,

37:09.300 --> 37:11.600
the source of all

37:11.636 --> 37:13.769
true art and science.

37:16.507 --> 37:19.875
That's... beautiful, Einstein.

37:19.911 --> 37:21.110
Yes, Einstein.

37:21.145 --> 37:22.244
That's who said it, Miller.

37:22.280 --> 37:24.580
The real mystery here
is your behavior,

37:24.615 --> 37:26.115
bringing Agent Scully

37:26.150 --> 37:28.117
down here without bothering
to consult me.

37:28.152 --> 37:29.752
Remarkably,

37:29.787 --> 37:31.754
I did nothing.
It was you who abandoned me,

37:31.789 --> 37:34.256
Agent Einstein,
for the crazy train.

37:34.292 --> 37:35.124
(scoffing laugh)

37:35.159 --> 37:37.326
Never again,

37:37.361 --> 37:38.928
Agent Miller.

37:38.963 --> 37:41.463
(muffled):
♪ secret heart... ♪

37:41.499 --> 37:43.465
Although something
is clearer to me now,

37:43.501 --> 37:45.467
as a result of the experience.

37:45.503 --> 37:46.735
The value of an open mind?

37:49.206 --> 37:51.206
The nature of reality.

37:51.242 --> 37:55.711
I'm now convinced that words
and ideas do have weight,

37:55.746 --> 37:59.715
the weight to move people to do
the most psychotic things.

37:59.750 --> 38:02.985
Giving someone
magic mushrooms?

38:03.020 --> 38:06.288
I was talking

Talk to me, Mulder.

39:10.054 --> 39:11.253
Oh...

39:11.288 --> 39:13.122
- where to begin?
- Why didn't

39:13.157 --> 39:15.124
you tell me about
your little scheme?

39:15.159 --> 39:18.260
Y-You were
on your own mission.

39:18.295 --> 39:21.196
And you would've
never bought that.

39:21.232 --> 39:23.432
Absolutely right.

39:23.467 --> 39:25.634
I have to applaud her, though,
on her clever trick

39:25.669 --> 39:28.570
- with the placebo.
- Yeah.

39:28.606 --> 39:30.205
Yeah.

39:30.241 --> 39:31.607
How did that work?

39:31.642 --> 39:33.976
(chuckles)

39:34.011 --> 39:35.911
Wonders never cease with you.

39:38.682 --> 39:41.116
I saw things, though, Scully.

39:41.152 --> 39:43.886
Powerful things.

39:43.921 --> 39:47.022
I saw deep
and unconditional love.

39:49.460 --> 39:51.126
I saw things, too.

39:51.162 --> 39:54.563
I witnessed unqualified hate

39:54.598 --> 39:57.199
that appears to have no end.

39:57.234 --> 39:59.234
(quietly):
Yeah.

39:59.270 --> 40:01.937
But how
to reconcile the two?

40:01.972 --> 40:03.572
The extremes of our nature.

40:03.607 --> 40:05.240
That's the question.

40:05.276 --> 40:08.410
Maybe the question of our times.

40:08.445 --> 40:10.445
(quiet laugh)

40:13.784 --> 40:15.150
Walk with me, Scully.

40:17.454 --> 40:21.623
This whole thing
has got me thinking.

40:21.659 --> 40:23.859
Thinking about God.

40:23.894 --> 40:26.728
You, Mulder,
thking about God?

40:26.764 --> 40:28.363
The angry God of the Bible.

40:28.399 --> 40:30.699
The Tower of Babel
and Babylon,

40:30.734 --> 40:32.034
scattering people violently,

40:32.069 --> 40:34.102
so there's never to speak
a common language.

40:34.138 --> 40:36.438
Punishing man
for his hubris.

40:36.473 --> 40:38.774
Well, that lesson didn't stick.

40:38.809 --> 40:43.312
But the anger sure remains.

40:43.347 --> 40:46.648
That's the same angry
God as in the Koran...

40:46.684 --> 40:48.684
ordering death
to the infidels.

40:48.719 --> 40:51.553
What exactly
is this God saying?

40:51.589 --> 40:53.789
Worship me and my great anger?

40:53.824 --> 40:55.624
Well, that's a good
question, Mulder.

40:55.659 --> 40:58.527
One for the ages.

40:58.562 --> 41:00.863
Well, think about the immense
power in those prophecies,

41:00.898 --> 41:03.131
the power in those words
to convince young men

41:03.167 --> 41:07.636
to put on suicide vests today
and murder for their angry God.

41:07.671 --> 41:09.738
What are you getting at?

41:09.773 --> 41:14.309
Those boys,
they just swallow the pill.

41:14.345 --> 41:16.845
It's the power of suggestion.

41:19.149 --> 41:23.085
- Is this received wisdom
from your magical mystery tour? - Yes.

41:23.120 --> 41:25.754
Courtesy of... the shrooms,

41:25.789 --> 41:29.758
something else,
something to trump all hatred...

41:29.793 --> 41:31.260
Mother Love.

41:31.295 --> 41:33.161
Whoa.

41:33.197 --> 41:35.063
I refuse to believe
that mothers are having babies

41:35.099 --> 41:36.098
just to be martyrs.

41:36.133 --> 41:37.566
I want to believe

41:37.601 --> 41:38.901
that mothers have
a greater purpose

41:38.936 --> 41:40.969
- for all of us.
- I agree.

41:41.005 --> 41:44.006
A child is not a tool
to spread hatred.

41:44.041 --> 41:46.742
But where does
the hatred end, though?

41:46.777 --> 41:48.510
Maybe it ends
where it began,

41:48.545 --> 41:51.546
by finding
a common language again.

41:51.582 --> 41:54.650
Maybe that's God's will.

41:54.685 --> 41:57.452
How can we really know?

41:57.488 --> 41:59.855
He's absent from the stage.

41:59.890 --> 42:02.057
(quietly): Well...

42:02.092 --> 42:05.060
maybe it's beyond words.

42:05.095 --> 42:07.462
Maybe we should do like
the prophets and...

42:07.498 --> 42:09.531
open our hearts

42:09.566 --> 42:11.433
and truly listen.

42:15.406 --> 42:17.539
(trumpeting)

42:20.477 --> 42:22.077
What?

42:22.112 --> 42:26.081
(trumpeting continues)

42:26.116 --> 42:27.816
