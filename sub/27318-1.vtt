01:13.218 --> 01:14.950
Why are we here?

01:14.952 --> 01:17.052
Maybe we should turn back?

01:17.054 --> 01:18.554
This is the designated sector.

01:18.556 --> 01:19.955
Got it?

01:19.957 --> 01:20.791
Got it.

01:21.493 --> 01:23.091
These are aliens.

01:23.093 --> 01:27.431
They are going to play
a key role in our story.

01:27.433 --> 01:29.165
This is Zaca.

01:29.167 --> 01:30.166
Zuc.

01:30.168 --> 01:31.504
And this is Zic.

01:32.505 --> 01:34.471
And what are we gonna do here?

01:34.473 --> 01:36.139
Any ideas?

01:36.141 --> 01:40.076
Look, guys, we have a
message from the Center.

01:43.649 --> 01:47.450
Attention, you
have entered the solar system.

01:47.452 --> 01:48.919
As legend has it,

01:48.921 --> 01:51.322
our ancestors hid a
multipurpose energy source

01:51.324 --> 01:52.890
on one of the planets.

01:52.892 --> 01:54.892
It emits a special signal.

01:54.894 --> 01:57.161
Your mission is to
locate the carrier

01:57.163 --> 01:58.996
and then return it to us.

01:58.998 --> 02:01.899
That's the only way
our planet can survive.

02:01.901 --> 02:04.635
Let's make our
planet great again!

02:04.637 --> 02:06.136
Let's go!

02:06.138 --> 02:07.139
- Oh.
- Okay.

02:35.034 --> 02:36.067
Here I am.

02:36.069 --> 02:37.570
Hi everybody.

02:37.572 --> 02:41.940
My name is Baz, and I'm
going to tell you a story.

02:41.942 --> 02:43.642
A very interesting one.

02:43.644 --> 02:46.978
To be honest, you might
think it's incredible,

02:46.980 --> 02:49.682
and I bet you won't
believe it at first,

02:49.684 --> 02:52.150
but it really happened.

02:52.152 --> 02:55.388
And you should know
that it's the truth.

02:55.390 --> 02:57.057
I swear on my cap.

03:36.098 --> 03:37.497
This is the beaver.

03:37.499 --> 03:39.032
His name is Bob.

03:39.034 --> 03:43.403
He's the most conscientious
beaver in the forest.

04:27.651 --> 04:31.319
Let me sing this song
for the bridesmaid!

04:55.780 --> 04:57.179
Hey, hey.

04:57.181 --> 04:57.847
What are you doing?

04:57.849 --> 04:59.648
Let me finish the song!

04:59.650 --> 05:00.483
Wait!

05:00.485 --> 05:01.351
Hold on!

05:01.353 --> 05:02.720
Gimme my guitar back!

05:18.236 --> 05:20.236
Not good enough, huh?

05:20.238 --> 05:22.572
What do you know about singing!

05:22.574 --> 05:24.141
One day, I'll become famous

05:24.143 --> 05:27.079
and everybody will
know about me.

05:28.147 --> 05:29.549
Hey, hey, w-w-wait!

05:30.783 --> 05:31.649
Hold on!

05:31.651 --> 05:33.150
Gimme my guitar back.

05:35.521 --> 05:36.754
And this is the cat.

05:36.756 --> 05:37.821
His name is Max.

05:37.823 --> 05:40.891
He wants to become famous,
but, frankly speaking,

05:40.893 --> 05:43.460
without much success.

05:43.462 --> 05:46.129
Well, this is how it all began.

05:49.403 --> 05:51.237
I'm flying, save me!

05:52.238 --> 05:53.137
I'm flying?

05:53.139 --> 05:54.773
Hey hey!

05:54.775 --> 05:55.609

06:34.181 --> 06:35.280
Hmm?

07:04.913 --> 07:05.748
Ah!

07:10.986 --> 07:13.754
A tiger is a very
dangerous animal.

07:13.756 --> 07:16.990
It is especially
cruel to beaver.

07:16.992 --> 07:18.558
Time to sleep.

07:34.010 --> 07:34.844
Hmm?

07:37.413 --> 07:38.479
What is it?

07:39.983 --> 07:40.817
Well, hmm.

Oh no, an elephant?

07:50.260 --> 07:51.292
No.

07:51.294 --> 07:52.360

07:52.362 --> 07:53.028
Tiger!

07:59.569 --> 08:00.836
Hello.

08:00.838 --> 08:01.602
Tiger!

08:05.876 --> 08:07.945
Oh, it better be a zebra!

08:10.848 --> 08:12.748
Huh, who are you?

08:12.750 --> 08:13.582
A cat.

08:13.584 --> 08:14.516
My name's Max.

08:14.518 --> 08:15.852
And where's that tiger?

08:15.854 --> 08:16.785
I don't know.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.387
Could I stay for the night?

08:18.389 --> 08:19.822
I'll sleep near the door.

08:19.824 --> 08:21.590
I'll sing you a song

Zebra?

09:53.921 --> 09:55.121
Uh uhn.

09:55.123 --> 09:55.957
Beaver?

09:58.458 --> 09:59.491
Right!

09:59.493 --> 10:00.327
Beaver.

10:01.762 --> 10:02.596
Huh?

10:07.634 --> 10:08.468
Ah ha!

10:09.703 --> 10:13.474
Smart home!

10:15.343 --> 10:18.077
So this is
how Max ended up

10:18.079 --> 10:21.848
living in the Beaver's house.

10:21.850 --> 10:23.916
And at this very time,

10:23.918 --> 10:27.153
absolutely extraordinary
events began to happen

10:27.155 --> 10:29.989
in the depths of
the Solar System.

10:40.135 --> 10:42.803
We've traveled across
half of the solar system,

10:42.805 --> 10:44.137
and still no signal.

10:44.139 --> 10:46.506
Yeah, no signal.

10:46.508 --> 10:48.208
Maybe we should turn back?

10:48.210 --> 10:49.475
Never give up.

10:49.477 --> 10:52.145
I turn on the onboard computer.

10:55.550 --> 10:57.550
The highest
probability of locating

10:57.552 --> 10:59.186
the energy source is
on the third planet

10:59.188 --> 11:00.554
from the big star.

11:00.556 --> 11:03.457
It's called the Blue Planet.

11:03.459 --> 11:04.926
Let's go!

11:04.928 --> 11:09.099
Full speed!

11:50.574 --> 11:51.243
Sing.

11:57.281 --> 11:59.848
One, two, three, four.

11:59.850 --> 12:02.151
Ouch!

12:02.153 --> 12:04.488
One, two, three, four, five.

12:05.589 --> 12:07.823
Ouch!

12:17.569 --> 12:18.603
Mmm?

12:21.606 --> 12:22.538
Hmm.

12:24.109 --> 12:25.642
Wha?

12:37.723 --> 12:41.192
Oh my, I can't handle
this thing alone.

12:41.194 --> 12:45.062
Quite often fishermen
find bottles in the sea.

12:45.064 --> 12:48.065
And if there is a map
inside such a bottle,

12:48.067 --> 12:49.333
then it might lead

12:49.335 --> 12:51.202
- to a hidden treasure.
- Max, are you sleeping?

12:53.672 --> 12:54.340
Max!

13:01.581 --> 13:02.913
Hmm?

13:21.067 --> 13:23.668
Oh what again.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.737
Max, help me uproot this tree.

13:25.739 --> 13:28.307
I want to build a sawmill here.

13:28.309 --> 13:29.375
Sure, sure, just a sec.

13:29.377 --> 13:31.777
As soon as I fish out
this bottle from the river

13:31.779 --> 13:33.245
with a treasure map inside.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.780
I'll be famous at last!

13:34.782 --> 13:36.782
Everyone will know me!

15:01.439 --> 15:03.740
Max, do you need any help?

15:05.041 --> 15:07.811
No no no no, I'll
manage, thanks.

15:08.945 --> 15:12.046
No way I'm sharing
my treasure with him.

15:12.048 --> 15:12.947
You're sure?

15:14.217 --> 15:16.753
Okay, you dig and
I'll take a rest.

Treasure!

15:51.223 --> 15:52.224
My treasure!

16:07.406 --> 16:08.804
Wow!

16:08.806 --> 16:10.275
What is this anyway?

16:34.900 --> 16:38.069
The signal from
the energy source.

16:38.071 --> 16:39.870
We found it!

16:39.872 --> 16:41.405
We'll be heroes!

16:41.407 --> 16:44.041
We'll make our
galaxy great again!

16:48.881 --> 16:50.014
We're being followed!

16:50.016 --> 16:51.351
It's Scratchers.

17:03.163 --> 17:04.195
Turn left!

17:04.198 --> 17:05.530
Do it!

17:05.531 --> 17:06.934
Turn right now!

17:07.601 --> 17:09.468
Give it to me.

17:09.470 --> 17:10.471
I can do it!

18:00.656 --> 18:01.424
Ah!

18:03.258 --> 18:05.091
A meteorite!

18:08.330 --> 18:10.065
Max, what happened?

18:14.337 --> 18:15.269
Huh?

18:15.271 --> 18:17.273
Holy Beaver, what's that?

18:23.446 --> 18:25.112
Run for your life!

18:38.929 --> 18:39.594
Huh?

18:39.596 --> 18:40.263
Huh?

18:45.602 --> 18:46.436
Huh?

18:53.176 --> 18:54.542
Huh?

18:54.544 --> 18:56.044
Did you see?

19:35.153 --> 19:37.186
What a strange language!

19:37.188 --> 19:39.155
Hey, Bob, who are they?

19:45.096 --> 19:46.763
Ah ah ah achoo!

19:52.639 --> 19:53.305
Look!

20:27.674 --> 20:30.274
Hey, Vic, are you
sure there was a signal?

20:30.276 --> 20:32.043
Yeah, of course, bro!

20:32.045 --> 20:34.612
I thought being an
ufologist is cool.

20:34.614 --> 20:37.082
We'd look for
UFOs, chase aliens,

20:37.084 --> 20:39.053
get famous, become rich.

20:40.454 --> 20:44.356
But we've been looking for
three years and still nothing!

20:44.358 --> 20:45.757
We're on the right track.

20:45.759 --> 20:47.826
The arrow spins like crazy!

20:49.263 --> 20:51.062
Well, it shows nothing now.

20:51.064 --> 20:52.063
You didn't dream it up, did you?

20:52.065 --> 20:53.097
Dream it up?

20:53.099 --> 20:54.165
You saw it!

20:54.167 --> 20:56.802
They are close, I can feel it.

20:56.804 --> 20:58.305
Yes, look, look!

20:59.274 --> 21:00.640
Right!

21:00.642 --> 21:02.209
Turn right, right!

21:05.145 --> 21:05.814
Drive on!

21:10.084 --> 21:11.318
Now left, left!

21:16.525 --> 21:18.090
Turn right!

21:18.092 --> 21:19.859
No, left, turn left!

21:19.861 --> 21:21.594
No, right!

21:21.596 --> 21:22.429
Drive on!

21:48.157 --> 21:50.190
And what are we gonna do now?

21:50.192 --> 21:51.525
You push it from
the front end,

21:51.527 --> 21:54.128
and I'll jump behind the
wheel and back it up.

21:54.130 --> 21:54.795
Oh come on.

21:54.797 --> 21:56.297
Why should I push it?

21:56.299 --> 21:59.333
Oh, well, I mean, I
mean, you're stronger.

21:59.335 --> 22:02.071
You always get
the easiest part.

22:03.573 --> 22:06.206
Come on, push harder!

22:06.208 --> 22:07.207
Come on!

22:07.209 --> 22:08.244
And again.

22:11.348 --> 22:13.181
Stop!

22:27.864 --> 22:29.229
What are they talking about?

22:29.231 --> 22:30.732
Well, who knows.

22:32.603 --> 22:33.535
Boom boom.

22:33.537 --> 22:35.270
Boom boom.

22:35.272 --> 22:36.339
Boom boom?

22:36.341 --> 22:39.109
Maybe we should
show them around.

22:52.422 --> 22:54.489
This is our house.

22:54.491 --> 22:55.525
We live here.

23:08.807 --> 23:10.807
This is our watermill.

23:10.809 --> 23:11.942
The river pushes this wheel

23:11.944 --> 23:14.243
and the watermill
grinds the flour.

23:14.245 --> 23:15.413
Oh!

23:16.982 --> 23:17.816
Got it?

23:22.520 --> 23:24.321
Stop!

23:31.563 --> 23:34.331
Here's where I will
put my sawmill.

23:34.333 --> 23:36.233
To cut wood.

23:37.536 --> 23:38.802
Boom boom.

23:38.804 --> 23:39.636
Boom.

23:39.638 --> 23:41.304
Boom.

23:41.306 --> 23:42.572
Come on!

23:42.574 --> 23:44.241
Who saws like that?

23:44.243 --> 23:45.442
Boom boom.

23:47.747 --> 23:49.380
Boom boom.

23:49.382 --> 23:51.315
Are you trying to
teach me how to saw?

23:51.317 --> 23:52.817
Ah ha!

23:52.819 --> 23:55.586
I was cutting wood when
you were not even around.

23:55.588 --> 23:57.922
Hey, Bob, listen.

23:57.924 --> 23:59.524
They don't care it all!

23:59.526 --> 24:01.928
They came from another planet.

24:02.796 --> 24:04.929
From the depths of the universe

24:04.931 --> 24:06.964
and you're talking about wood.

24:08.535 --> 24:12.705
Maybe they need to
find out about Earth!

24:14.374 --> 24:18.409
Our civilization is a
civilization of brave discoverers!

24:18.411 --> 24:21.479
In times of Ancient
Greece, we invented wings

24:21.481 --> 24:23.749
and reached the Sun.

24:23.751 --> 24:26.417
We are a civilization
of inventors,

24:26.419 --> 24:28.721
such as the Montgolfier Brothers

24:28.723 --> 24:31.289
who were first to
conquer the sky

24:31.291 --> 24:32.827
in a hot air balloon.

24:33.828 --> 24:36.062
A civilization of sky champions

24:36.064 --> 24:39.933
that built and flew
the first airplane.

24:39.935 --> 24:44.438
A civilization of space
heroes who landed on the moon!

24:59.421 --> 25:02.022
No, Max, you're
telling it all wrong!

25:02.024 --> 25:04.259
This is how the story goes.

25:06.062 --> 25:08.361
Truly our civilization

25:08.363 --> 25:10.697
is a civilization of builders.

25:10.699 --> 25:14.400
They created the great
pyramids in Ancient Egypt.

25:14.402 --> 25:16.970
Their most remarkable
masterpiece

25:16.972 --> 25:19.405
is the Great Wall of China.

25:19.407 --> 25:22.877
Its length is more
than 20,000 kilometers.

25:22.879 --> 25:25.948
It can be seen even
from outer space.

25:27.116 --> 25:29.350
Builders discovered
new technologies.

25:29.352 --> 25:32.419
They created magnificent
and strong fortresses

25:32.421 --> 25:35.122
and built a tower with
the most accurate clock

25:35.124 --> 25:37.292
in the world, the Big Ben!

25:38.628 --> 25:41.395
They established
high-rise skyscrapers

25:41.397 --> 25:45.699
and established a statue
of freedom in America!

25:45.701 --> 25:48.870
They created the most beautiful
monument in the world,

25:48.872 --> 25:51.405
the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

25:51.407 --> 25:53.775
And many buildings and cities!

25:59.482 --> 26:01.448
Wow, unbelievable!

26:01.450 --> 26:02.751
Now you know, huh!

26:02.753 --> 26:04.853
And you mumble about
your hot air balloons.

26:04.855 --> 26:05.689
High five!

26:19.403 --> 26:20.368
What?

26:29.080 --> 26:30.745
Huh?

26:30.747 --> 26:32.449
- Uh uh.
- Mmm mmm.

26:37.622 --> 26:38.556
Boo boom.

26:50.568 --> 26:52.935
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells

26:52.937 --> 26:55.938
♪ Jingle all the way

26:55.940 --> 26:58.507

planet great again.

27:36.983 --> 27:37.817
Awesome!

27:40.153 --> 27:40.987
Wow!

28:08.748 --> 28:09.714
Me speak?

28:09.716 --> 28:11.284
Me speak!

28:11.286 --> 28:14.054
I can speak your language!

28:14.056 --> 28:15.955
Dear Earthlings!

28:15.957 --> 28:17.723
We are happy to greet you

28:17.725 --> 28:19.825
on behalf of our galaxy.

28:20.895 --> 28:22.795
We are happy, too.

28:22.797 --> 28:25.030
Let us sing a song for you!

28:25.032 --> 28:26.266
No, Max, please.

28:26.268 --> 28:27.566
I'm begging you.

28:27.568 --> 28:29.001
Bob, don't worry!

28:29.003 --> 28:30.604
You need help us!

28:31.605 --> 28:34.574
Of course, just a sec!

28:37.579 --> 28:39.145
♪ At first I was afraid

Thank you.

29:16.352 --> 29:17.885
It is very beautiful song.

29:19.088 --> 29:21.688
But we need to
fix our spaceship.

29:21.690 --> 29:22.826
Now you help us?

29:27.364 --> 29:29.264
Well, let's see.

29:29.266 --> 29:31.066
Too many wires.

29:31.068 --> 29:33.068
Where are they, by the way?

29:33.070 --> 29:34.202
I need a wrench.

29:34.204 --> 29:35.303
No, an ax.

29:35.305 --> 29:36.804
Large ax!

29:36.806 --> 29:38.975
Too many extra parts here.

29:44.081 --> 29:45.746
Everything's so small.

29:45.748 --> 29:48.117
Surely not for beavers.

29:48.119 --> 29:49.953
I wonder how it flies.

29:53.657 --> 29:55.090
Loads of trash inside.

29:57.395 --> 29:58.927
Oh.

29:58.929 --> 29:59.763
Phew!

30:01.999 --> 30:02.831
What?

30:02.833 --> 30:04.333
I'm finished.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.291
You made all of it up, Vic.

30:28.293 --> 30:30.726
There're no aliens here, bro.

30:30.728 --> 30:31.696
Let's go home!

30:34.032 --> 30:35.432
Look how strong the signal is.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.301
Right, huh?

30:37.303 --> 30:39.105
Now we'll show them!

30:49.782 --> 30:50.680
Hmm?

30:50.682 --> 30:51.683
Hmm, hmm.

30:56.956 --> 30:57.755
Ha!

30:59.459 --> 31:02.227
Gotcha, surrender, dwarf!

31:02.229 --> 31:04.761
You are my prisoner from now on.

31:04.763 --> 31:08.433
You're going to pay
for all your mischiefs!

31:10.970 --> 31:14.004
It's so boring.

31:14.006 --> 31:17.009
I'm stuck here for
the whole summer.

31:17.910 --> 31:18.744
Hmm?

31:19.979 --> 31:20.813
Hmm.

31:22.716 --> 31:25.685
Oh, I know, let's
play a hunting game!

31:31.158 --> 31:32.260
Hey, hey, ha.

31:34.395 --> 31:37.128
Hunter's
rule number one,

31:37.130 --> 31:41.902
to become one with nature and
be invisible for your prey.

31:50.445 --> 31:52.978
Hunter's rule number two,

31:52.980 --> 31:55.283
to be attentive and cunning.

32:01.389 --> 32:02.223
Huh, hey.

32:04.525 --> 32:07.862
I can feel there's
an animal trail here.

32:09.897 --> 32:10.899
Ah ah achoo!

32:19.308 --> 32:22.144
The third rule,
always be patient.

32:23.512 --> 32:25.312
You have to prepare a trap,

32:25.314 --> 32:28.114
build a hideout, and wait.

32:31.987 --> 32:33.989
Hmm.

32:36.792 --> 32:38.825
Predators are on their way.

32:42.332 --> 32:43.797
Hey!

32:59.849 --> 33:01.882
Hunter's main rule,

33:01.884 --> 33:03.786
never let your prey go!

33:09.892 --> 33:10.927
Hey, hey!

33:13.597 --> 33:14.864
Woo, woo hoo!

33:44.194 --> 33:45.961
That's no good.

33:46.998 --> 33:48.398
The source!

33:48.400 --> 33:49.966
The energy source!

33:49.968 --> 33:51.100
We need it.

33:51.102 --> 33:53.903
That's why we
crashed so foolishly.

33:53.905 --> 33:56.205
Do you have an idea where it is?

33:56.207 --> 33:57.573
Mmm nnn.

33:57.575 --> 33:59.475
We need it so much.

33:59.477 --> 34:00.877
Our planet is going to die

34:00.879 --> 34:02.011
- without it.
- Hot diggity dog.

34:02.013 --> 34:03.513
- You have to help us!
- Awesome!

34:03.515 --> 34:04.480
You have to!

34:04.482 --> 34:06.318
What on Earth is it?

34:07.885 --> 34:09.452
Let's see.

34:10.289 --> 34:11.123
Oops.

34:13.958 --> 34:14.924
I'm flying.

34:15.927 --> 34:16.993
Flying again!

34:16.995 --> 34:17.661
Huh?

34:17.663 --> 34:19.362
Me too.

34:58.105 --> 35:00.608
And where are we headed now?

35:01.975 --> 35:02.641
I don't know.

35:02.643 --> 35:04.111
The signal's gone.

35:07.147 --> 35:08.179
Look!

35:08.181 --> 35:09.013
There it is.

35:09.015 --> 35:09.682
We're definitely nearby.

35:09.684 --> 35:10.917
Move it!

35:20.427 --> 35:21.595
Who are you?

35:23.064 --> 35:24.163
I'm Baz.

35:24.165 --> 35:26.699
I'm here on holidays,
staying at my grandparents'.

35:26.701 --> 35:29.602
Sorry, I pushed the button.

35:29.604 --> 35:31.103
But why?

35:31.105 --> 35:32.106
Yeah, why?

35:33.474 --> 35:35.007
I didn't mean it.

35:35.009 --> 35:36.108
I thought...

35:36.110 --> 35:38.177
Oh, ah wa wa wa!

35:38.179 --> 35:40.713
Ah, you didn't think about it?

35:40.715 --> 35:42.415
How are we gonna get down?

35:42.417 --> 35:46.017
You need to reach the
gadget and press a button.

35:53.595 --> 35:55.364
How do we reach it?

35:56.432 --> 35:58.030
We need to push each other.

35:58.032 --> 36:01.201
I'll catch it and
press a button.

36:01.203 --> 36:03.737
All right, let's
give it a try.

36:22.792 --> 36:24.659
Look, look!

36:24.661 --> 36:27.027
That's a flying saucer!

36:27.029 --> 36:29.062
And real aliens!

36:29.064 --> 36:31.766
Now we gonna be world famous!

36:31.768 --> 36:33.703
And we'll be rich, bro!

36:53.189 --> 36:55.058
What do we do now?

36:56.059 --> 36:57.225
I know!

36:57.227 --> 36:58.594
Did you forget?

36:58.596 --> 37:00.462
Hot air balloon!

37:00.464 --> 37:01.265
Exactly!

37:03.467 --> 37:04.600
Hot air balloon?

37:04.602 --> 37:05.536
From where?

37:12.810 --> 37:14.610
Turned out that after the cat

37:14.612 --> 37:17.112
moved into the Beaver's house

37:17.114 --> 37:19.517
another unusual thing happened.

37:45.410 --> 37:47.112
Hot air balloon?

37:48.447 --> 37:49.281
Ah!

37:55.387 --> 37:58.323
I can't make a
pie with this guy.

38:05.130 --> 38:06.162
Huh?

38:06.164 --> 38:07.363
Hey wait.

38:07.365 --> 38:08.632
You need to be
careful with that.

38:08.634 --> 38:10.568
Everything needs to
be checked properly.

38:10.570 --> 38:11.435
Come on!

38:11.437 --> 38:13.203
You're simply jealous!

38:13.205 --> 38:15.539
La la la la la la la la!

38:27.587 --> 38:28.419
Huh!

38:28.421 --> 38:29.386
Stop!

38:30.656 --> 38:34.094
Wait, are
you out of your mind?

38:37.531 --> 38:39.099
Somebody help me!

38:40.634 --> 38:41.766
I'll save you!

38:41.768 --> 38:43.268
Hold on!

38:43.270 --> 38:44.669
Stay where you are.

39:09.297 --> 39:09.964
Uh?

39:52.307 --> 39:55.009
I just wanted to be famous.

39:55.011 --> 39:57.344
Everybody wants to
become a celebrity

39:57.346 --> 40:00.247
but not everyone admits to it.

40:00.249 --> 40:01.183
My oh my.

40:06.855 --> 40:08.755
Max, don't get upset.

40:08.757 --> 40:10.391
We'll have it fixed.

40:11.261 --> 40:12.427
Really?

40:12.429 --> 40:13.294
Promise?

40:13.296 --> 40:15.331
I swear by my tooth.

40:23.773 --> 40:25.873
And that's that.

40:25.875 --> 40:27.377
Yeah, like that.

40:28.278 --> 40:29.610
Then let's go.

40:29.612 --> 40:31.614
What we are waiting for?

41:00.311 --> 41:03.512
We will lift your flying
saucer up and then drop it.

41:03.514 --> 41:06.883
We'll boost your speed once
you've got up in the sky.

41:06.885 --> 41:07.717
Yeah!

41:07.719 --> 41:09.384
And you'll warp speed.

41:10.889 --> 41:12.354
Boom boom.

41:13.390 --> 41:14.391
Boom boom.

41:15.794 --> 41:17.426
No way, we can't!

41:17.428 --> 41:19.428
We need the source.

41:19.430 --> 41:20.964
But we will do it!

41:20.966 --> 41:22.532
Get in now.

41:22.534 --> 41:23.602
All aboard!

41:26.038 --> 41:29.374
We're doomed.

41:47.360 --> 41:48.561
Sail off!

41:50.130 --> 41:51.462
Huh?

41:51.464 --> 41:52.696
Look!

41:52.698 --> 41:53.531
Huh?

41:53.533 --> 41:54.567
Blow me down!

42:05.812 --> 42:06.977
I know them.

42:06.979 --> 42:08.412
They are ufologists.

42:08.414 --> 42:09.981
Alien hunters!

42:09.983 --> 42:11.917
They kidnapped
our little aliens.

42:11.919 --> 42:13.418
After them!

42:22.462 --> 42:23.394
There they are!

42:23.396 --> 42:25.063
Hold on tight!

42:25.065 --> 42:26.466
We'll show you!

42:45.954 --> 42:48.721
Bro, are we millionaires now?

42:48.723 --> 42:50.589
Billionaires, bro!

42:50.591 --> 42:52.859
Superstars and greatest heroes!

42:53.928 --> 42:56.461
I told you I was right, hah!

43:07.609 --> 43:09.109
You okay?

43:09.111 --> 43:09.977
I don't know.

43:09.979 --> 43:10.812
Huh?

43:14.449 --> 43:15.481
What's that?

43:16.885 --> 43:19.919
Hey, hey come back!

43:19.921 --> 43:21.955
Ha ha, gotcha!

43:21.957 --> 43:22.956
Freeze!

43:22.958 --> 43:24.057
Hands up!

43:24.994 --> 43:27.461
We give up, we give up!

43:27.463 --> 43:28.464
Right, Nick?

43:29.598 --> 43:31.767
Yeah, we give up!

43:41.510 --> 43:43.043
What are we gonna do?

43:43.045 --> 43:44.678
Are you asking me?

43:44.680 --> 43:46.180
It's your fault
we're stuck here!

43:46.182 --> 43:51.187
We were just
on the brink of success.

43:52.122 --> 43:55.125
Ow!

44:11.676 --> 44:14.076
Okay, fine.

44:17.048 --> 44:18.914
Get ready, and...

45:32.158 --> 45:34.125
Dear space guests!

45:34.127 --> 45:37.663
I am happy to welcome
you to my beehive!

45:41.634 --> 45:42.601
Ah ah achoo!

45:53.747 --> 45:55.082
Help me!

46:25.646 --> 46:27.313
It's useless, bro!

46:27.315 --> 46:28.680
It's all your fault!

46:28.682 --> 46:30.717
No, it's your fault!

46:31.652 --> 46:33.920
Could you not notice the pit?

46:33.922 --> 46:37.190
If it wasn't for me,
we would be losers.

46:37.192 --> 46:38.724
And who are we now?

46:38.726 --> 46:41.227
Did you even take a
picture of those aliens?

46:41.229 --> 46:42.829
I was in a hurry!

46:42.831 --> 46:44.897
'Cause you're an idiot.

46:44.899 --> 46:47.700
Yeah, 'cause I'm an idiot.

46:48.370 --> 46:49.369
What?

46:49.371 --> 46:50.705
You're an idiot!

46:57.913 --> 46:59.880
Do you see this?

46:59.882 --> 47:02.416
Oh, who's the idiot here?

47:02.418 --> 47:05.287
Yeah, it won't fit in our van.

47:18.767 --> 47:20.767
I'm kind of scared, bro.

47:20.769 --> 47:23.738
What if they came to
avenge their brothers?

47:23.740 --> 47:25.073
Right!

47:25.075 --> 47:26.143
We're doomed.

48:01.212 --> 48:02.344
We're saved, bro!

48:06.883 --> 48:09.486
Welcome to our planet Earth!

48:09.488 --> 48:12.755
We represent our civilization,

48:12.757 --> 48:14.256
the best civilization
in the universe.

48:14.258 --> 48:17.793
Isn't it a bit too much, bro?

48:17.795 --> 48:19.864
Yeah, well, uh, I mean,

48:21.265 --> 48:23.533
I wanted to say that.

48:23.535 --> 48:26.035
I wanted to, but I didn't.

48:26.037 --> 48:29.840
We are the second best
after you guys, huh?

48:31.175 --> 48:32.374
Uh huh.

48:33.845 --> 48:36.846
Yeah, and we're very
happy to make contact.

48:39.918 --> 48:43.253
Where're you going?

48:43.255 --> 48:44.087
Vic!

48:44.089 --> 48:45.488
Goodbye, bro!

48:45.490 --> 48:46.325
Avenge me!

48:47.259 --> 48:48.091
I can't, Vic.

48:48.093 --> 48:49.828
I'm coming after you!

49:25.165 --> 49:26.998
Finally, I'll become famous

49:27.000 --> 49:29.534
and the whole
world will know me!

49:48.289 --> 49:49.921
Help!

49:49.923 --> 49:51.825
Somebody help, help me!

49:57.532 --> 50:01.366
Help me!

50:08.008 --> 50:09.643
They're Scratchers!

50:09.645 --> 50:11.477
They collect animals
from all planets

50:11.479 --> 50:13.146
and bring them to the Space Zoo

50:13.148 --> 50:15.817
on the big entertainment planet.

50:18.620 --> 50:19.988
They chase us.

50:21.189 --> 50:23.556
I drive as good as I could.

50:23.558 --> 50:25.393
But they still got us.

50:34.670 --> 50:36.503
I landed ship on Earth

50:36.505 --> 50:38.941
and now Scratchers come here!

50:40.409 --> 50:43.910
We'll go get Max.

50:43.912 --> 50:46.280
Finally an adventure!

50:46.282 --> 50:48.048
It's our fault
that the Scratchers

50:48.050 --> 50:51.018
came here and offended you.

50:51.020 --> 50:52.288
We'll go with you!

51:15.712 --> 51:18.313
What will happen to us, bro?

51:18.315 --> 51:19.647
I don't know.

51:19.649 --> 51:23.017
Maybe they will
experiment on us.

51:23.019 --> 51:24.119
Huh?

51:24.121 --> 51:25.122
Experiments?

51:27.558 --> 51:28.459
Let us out!

51:33.130 --> 51:37.065
We're not animals, we're
intelligent beings!

51:40.537 --> 51:41.970
Well, I am, Nick.

51:41.972 --> 51:43.573
Not sure about you.

51:50.314 --> 51:51.414
My beehives!

51:51.416 --> 51:52.515
My honey!

51:52.517 --> 51:53.717
My bees!

51:53.719 --> 51:55.050
All is lost.

51:55.052 --> 51:57.754
What will they do without me?

51:57.756 --> 51:59.455
Would you stop fussing?

51:59.457 --> 52:00.990
I'm trying to think.

52:00.992 --> 52:01.724
Do something.

52:01.726 --> 52:04.627
Yeah, sure, like what, huh?

52:04.629 --> 52:06.097
You're right.

52:13.572 --> 52:15.005
Hang on.

52:15.007 --> 52:17.240
Let's play a game!

52:17.242 --> 52:19.111
What kind of game?

52:20.212 --> 52:22.714
Rock-paper-scissors for fun.

52:24.349 --> 52:25.782
Are you kidding me?

52:25.784 --> 52:28.318
Don't you understand
what happened to us?

52:28.320 --> 52:29.619
We're doomed!

52:29.621 --> 52:31.086
Do you get it?

52:31.088 --> 52:32.556
I do, I do.

52:32.558 --> 52:33.691
I know it's the end.

52:33.693 --> 52:35.726
All the better to play.

52:35.728 --> 52:36.995
Before death.

52:38.231 --> 52:40.631
Hey, I have a plan.

52:40.633 --> 52:41.468
Mmm hmm?

52:44.370 --> 52:46.671
One, two, three!

52:47.807 --> 52:49.105
You loser!

52:49.107 --> 52:50.140
Your forehead.

52:51.444 --> 52:52.645
Make it louder.

53:02.088 --> 53:03.423
One, two, three!

53:04.290 --> 53:05.791
You lost again, Mr. Bear.

53:12.332 --> 53:15.166
Hey, wait, wait,
wait, guys, guys!

53:15.168 --> 53:18.102
It's just a game,
rock-paper-scissors!

53:18.104 --> 53:19.470
The rules are simple.

53:19.472 --> 53:21.473
Here, see my fist?

53:21.475 --> 53:23.175
We form a rock.

53:23.177 --> 53:24.011
Or paper.

53:24.846 --> 53:26.378
Or scissors.

53:26.380 --> 53:27.214
Got it?

53:30.284 --> 53:32.251
Scissors cut the paper.

53:32.253 --> 53:34.353
Rock crushes scissors.

53:34.355 --> 53:36.622
Paper covers rock.

53:36.624 --> 53:38.590
Do you wanna play?

53:47.702 --> 53:50.670
One, two, three!

53:50.672 --> 53:53.206
There, my rock
crushes your scissors.

53:53.208 --> 53:54.207
I won!

53:54.209 --> 53:56.142
Give me your gun!

54:04.352 --> 54:05.752
Don't get upset.

54:05.754 --> 54:07.186
It's not a big deal.

54:07.188 --> 54:09.155
You'll get it all back.

54:09.157 --> 54:10.089
I have an idea.

54:10.091 --> 54:12.893
If I lose, I'll give
you your stuff back.

54:12.895 --> 54:15.194
And if I win, you'll let us go.

54:15.196 --> 54:17.263
Sound good?

54:19.134 --> 54:20.166
What?

54:20.168 --> 54:20.836
Huh?

54:45.561 --> 54:48.564
Don't worry, I'll
come back for you!

54:54.203 --> 54:54.871
Oops!

54:56.505 --> 54:59.407
Where now?

54:59.409 --> 55:01.111
Which way, which way?

55:02.346 --> 55:03.778
Maybe go right?

55:03.780 --> 55:04.615
No, left?

55:05.682 --> 55:07.816
Oh no, just move, move, move!

55:07.818 --> 55:09.651
They couldn't hang a sign
up or anything, could they?

55:12.289 --> 55:13.722
Another ventilator.

55:13.724 --> 55:14.558
Turn here.

55:16.961 --> 55:19.294
Oh it's a true labyrinth!

55:19.296 --> 55:20.729
Where am I?

55:20.731 --> 55:21.833
Wow, a hatch.

55:24.369 --> 55:25.203
So deep.

55:26.504 --> 55:28.506
I should be c-c-careful.

56:03.341 --> 56:05.243
Bob, hey, are you here?

56:07.311 --> 56:08.279
Nobody's home.

56:10.416 --> 56:11.250
Ah, there!

56:22.428 --> 56:24.263
Where are they anyway?

56:25.631 --> 56:28.733
Maybe they're
trying to rescue me.

56:29.903 --> 56:30.736
Oh!

56:42.348 --> 56:46.486
Oh I can't
believe my eyes!

56:58.999 --> 57:00.365
They've been caught!

57:00.367 --> 57:01.700
Oh, they're inside.

57:01.702 --> 57:03.068
What should I do?

57:03.070 --> 57:04.670
What should I do?

57:04.672 --> 57:05.871
Save them!

57:05.873 --> 57:06.705
Woo hoo!

57:30.331 --> 57:31.365
Ow!

57:47.382 --> 57:48.515
Surrender!

57:48.517 --> 57:50.753
I'm here to free everybody.

58:13.643 --> 58:15.043
Right!

58:15.045 --> 58:16.610
The flying saucer.

58:28.658 --> 58:30.457
So how does it work?

58:32.595 --> 58:33.995
I'm flying!

58:35.766 --> 58:36.731
What's going on?

58:51.715 --> 58:53.882
Of course, the treasure!

59:19.043 --> 59:20.477
Uh upside down.

59:29.855 --> 59:31.154
Oh!

59:36.794 --> 59:37.629
Hmm?

59:39.664 --> 59:41.098
Hmm.

01:00:01.087 --> 01:00:02.486
It's so good!

01:00:02.488 --> 01:00:03.587
It's awesome!

01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:04.855
Can I go up like this?

01:00:04.857 --> 01:00:07.591
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:00:07.593 --> 01:00:08.893
Oh, oh, oh wait.

01:00:08.895 --> 01:00:09.894
The bridge, the bridge!

01:00:14.167 --> 01:00:17.001
Come on, you stupid
piece of metal!

01:00:17.003 --> 01:00:17.835
Just stop!

01:00:17.837 --> 01:00:19.003
Please!

01:00:19.005 --> 01:00:20.104
I'm flying upside down.

01:00:20.106 --> 01:00:21.272
Again.

01:00:21.274 --> 01:00:22.108
And again!

01:00:23.143 --> 01:00:24.210
Not so quick!

01:00:28.148 --> 01:00:29.614
Yes, here we go!

01:00:29.616 --> 01:00:31.282
Woo, come on!

01:00:31.284 --> 01:00:33.819
Come on, let's go!

01:00:38.159 --> 01:00:38.826
That's it.

01:00:42.697 --> 01:00:45.064
This is left, this is right.

01:00:45.066 --> 01:00:46.033
Up and down.

01:00:48.769 --> 01:00:50.169
What now?

01:00:50.171 --> 01:00:51.303
Weapon!

01:00:51.305 --> 01:00:52.472
Where is it?

01:00:56.643 --> 01:00:57.643
Ah ha!

01:00:57.645 --> 01:00:58.778
Ta da!

01:01:06.021 --> 01:01:09.555
I broke my tail!

01:01:11.326 --> 01:01:12.591
Got it.

01:01:12.593 --> 01:01:16.164
Let's go!

01:01:30.113 --> 01:01:32.547
Fine, fine, where are they?

01:01:34.683 --> 01:01:36.916
Ah ha, there they are!

01:01:36.918 --> 01:01:38.618
Feel my wrath!

01:01:50.166 --> 01:01:50.967
Uh oh!

01:01:58.174 --> 01:01:59.774
Got ya, got ya!

01:01:59.776 --> 01:02:01.242
There!

01:02:01.244 --> 01:02:02.545
Oh no, I missed.

01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:18.760
What's that?

01:02:18.762 --> 01:02:20.030
A force shield.

01:03:02.974 --> 01:03:03.808
Phew.

01:03:04.709 --> 01:03:05.942
I got away.

01:03:09.881 --> 01:03:10.715
Oh!

01:03:37.776 --> 01:03:39.176
We need to help him!

01:03:39.178 --> 01:03:40.344
But how?

01:03:40.346 --> 01:03:41.347

Wait, hey, whoa!

01:06:20.978 --> 01:06:25.315
Many years ago our
civilization visit your planet

01:06:25.317 --> 01:06:27.583
and left the energy source.

01:06:27.585 --> 01:06:29.951
We think you ancestors hide it

01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:32.120
and you find it.

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:34.458
It sent a signal into space,

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:37.362
we fly by your
planet and catch it.

01:06:38.497 --> 01:06:41.665
But Scratchers, boom
boom, attack us,

01:06:41.667 --> 01:06:42.967
but you save.

01:06:44.002 --> 01:06:47.103
Now we are friends
forever and ever.

01:06:47.105 --> 01:06:49.205
Max, you're a hero.

01:06:49.207 --> 01:06:50.108
Supercat!

01:06:51.309 --> 01:06:53.910
Hero hero hero hero!

01:06:53.912 --> 01:06:55.278
You'll be famous.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.014
My bees will tell everybody

01:06:57.016 --> 01:06:59.650
about you in our forest.

01:06:59.652 --> 01:07:03.921
I'll spread the word
about you in India.

01:07:03.923 --> 01:07:06.325
You'll be famous in Africa.

01:07:08.327 --> 01:07:11.995
And
in Antarctica too.

01:07:11.997 --> 01:07:15.966
We'll tell about you to
everyone on our planet.

01:07:15.968 --> 01:07:17.201
You will be

01:07:17.203 --> 01:07:19.638
the most famous
cat in our galaxy.

01:07:20.607 --> 01:07:22.943
And in the whole universe.

01:07:24.177 --> 01:07:26.478
Thank you, friends.

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:29.383
But, I just wanted
to save you all.

01:07:32.419 --> 01:07:34.488
And to become a famous...

01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:39.626
I have all the time for that.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.361
There are more important things.

01:08:06.119 --> 01:08:07.988
So, we need to go.

01:08:10.124 --> 01:08:11.625
And where to?

01:08:11.627 --> 01:08:12.460
Home?

01:08:14.462 --> 01:08:19.133
Yes, but first we deliver
Scratchers to the Space Zoo.

01:08:24.037 --> 01:08:26.037
Make sure you don't
miss a thing, bro!

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.742
I won't.

01:08:28.743 --> 01:08:29.678
Look, look!

01:08:32.113 --> 01:08:32.948
Bingo!

01:08:34.116 --> 01:08:36.483
Well, who is in
the cage now, huh?

01:08:41.356 --> 01:08:42.256
Say cheese!

01:08:52.234 --> 01:08:53.767
What's that, bro?

01:08:55.437 --> 01:08:58.072
I don't know, but I
guess we're taking off!

01:09:21.631 --> 01:09:24.500
All right, I need to go home.

01:09:24.502 --> 01:09:25.801
Bye!

01:09:25.803 --> 01:09:28.136
I'll drop by tomorrow, okay?

01:09:29.072 --> 01:09:30.240
Better not.

01:09:55.566 --> 01:09:58.133
Do you think
they'll come back?

01:09:58.135 --> 01:10:01.539
I don't know.

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:04.308
I wish they would.

01:10:27.732 --> 01:10:29.399
They'll come back.

01:10:29.401 --> 01:10:30.867
Of course, they will.

01:10:32.204 --> 01:10:34.674
Who else will teach them sawing?

01:10:35.775 --> 01:10:37.374
When it comes to sawing,

01:10:38.678 --> 01:10:39.910
we're the best.

01:10:46.252 --> 01:10:48.151
Well, that's it.

01:10:48.153 --> 01:10:50.756
But new adventures
await us ahead.

01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:57.729
Please
tell us what happened?

01:10:57.731 --> 01:11:01.332
Well, I mean, we were
abducted by aliens!

01:11:01.334 --> 01:11:04.536
Uh, they had
melon-shaped heads.

01:11:04.538 --> 01:11:07.237
They wanted to
experiment on us.

01:11:07.239 --> 01:11:08.873
Yeah, they did!

01:11:08.875 --> 01:11:11.910
And do you expect
people to believe you?

01:11:16.817 --> 01:11:17.649
Boom.

01:11:17.651 --> 01:11:18.482
Boom boom.

01:11:21.488 --> 01:11:22.489
Boom boom!
