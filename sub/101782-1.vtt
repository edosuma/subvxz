So anyway,

04:48.134 --> 04:49.980
I have told Ahmed

04:50.020 --> 04:50.980
that you and I went to college

04:51.020 --> 04:52.980
like a gazillion years ago.

04:53.020 --> 04:54.583
And then she went on

04:54.623 --> 04:57.000
to become a big shot at Yahoo.

04:58.000 --> 04:58.994
Wow, Yahoo. Was that, like,

04:59.034 --> 05:00.594

05:01.000 --> 05:01.980
Uh, yeah. We used to have to

05:02.020 --> 05:03.623
hand crank the computers

05:03.663 --> 05:04.980
to get them started.

05:05.020 --> 05:05.980
No way.

05:06.020 --> 05:06.980
I'm just kidding.

05:07.020 --> 05:08.285
So, Carol, tell us,

05:08.325 --> 05:09.980
what have you been up to?

05:10.020 --> 05:10.791
Last few years,

05:10.831 --> 05:11.980
I've been working with

05:12.020 --> 05:13.063
quite a few different

05:13.103 --> 05:13.980
non-profit groups.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.195
And, uh, nothing really

05:15.235 --> 05:15.980
came out of it,

05:16.020 --> 05:16.497
but made

05:16.537 --> 05:17.980
a lot of great friends.

05:18.020 --> 05:19.350
I'm totally interested in

05:19.390 --> 05:20.980
everything that you're saying,

05:21.020 --> 05:21.306
but I think

05:21.346 --> 05:21.980
we're ready to move on.

05:22.020 --> 05:22.243
-Yeah.

05:22.283 --> 05:22.980
-[Ahmed chuckles]

05:26.331 --> 05:27.980
to help with our next rollout.

05:28.020 --> 05:29.980
Yeah. We need a rock star,

05:30.020 --> 05:31.593
because Badunkadunk.com

05:31.633 --> 05:32.980
is about to blow up.

05:33.020 --> 05:34.980
[mimics explosion]

05:35.020 --> 05:35.980
Funny you bring that up,

05:36.020 --> 05:36.485
because I actually

05:36.525 --> 05:37.605
had some questions

05:38.000 --> 05:39.980
on your basic business model.

05:40.020 --> 05:40.899
-Our model?

05:40.939 --> 05:41.980
-[Carol] Yes.

05:42.020 --> 05:43.118

05:43.158 --> 05:43.980
on our model.

05:44.020 --> 05:44.303
[laughs]

05:44.343 --> 05:44.980
It's very simple.

05:45.020 --> 05:46.098
[Ahmed] Okay.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.980
Our business model is,

05:48.020 --> 05:50.980
"Everyone gets some."

05:51.020 --> 05:51.316
-Get... Oh!

05:51.356 --> 05:52.676

05:53.000 --> 05:53.521
those other apps pretend like

05:53.561 --> 05:53.980
they're trying to get you

05:54.020 --> 05:55.980
a date or your soulmates?

05:56.020 --> 05:56.980
Wa-wa, no thanks.

05:57.020 --> 05:57.980
[Leslie] Not Badunkadunk.

05:58.020 --> 05:59.475
We are all about

05:59.515 --> 06:01.980
getting people badunkadunk.

06:02.020 --> 06:03.460
Yeah. Just slamming them

06:04.772 --> 06:04.980
-Yeah.

06:05.020 --> 06:05.980
Slamming it.

06:06.020 --> 06:07.980
The question is, Carol,

06:08.020 --> 06:08.603
what are you bringing

06:08.643 --> 06:08.980
to the party?

06:09.020 --> 06:09.980
Yeah.

06:10.020 --> 06:11.980
Well, I think you both know

06:12.020 --> 06:12.750
what I can do

06:12.790 --> 06:13.980
at a corporate level.

06:14.020 --> 06:14.933
Um, I've had quite

06:14.973 --> 06:15.980
a bit of experience.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.919
But what I'm excited

06:17.959 --> 06:18.980
about doing

06:19.020 --> 06:20.698
is really finding that sweet

06:20.738 --> 06:21.980
spot for your company

06:22.020 --> 06:23.725
that lies between

06:23.765 --> 06:25.980
corporate philanthropy

06:26.020 --> 06:26.980
and profitability.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.980
You mean recycling and stuff?

06:29.020 --> 06:30.486
Well, that's all great

06:30.526 --> 06:31.980
and that's part of it,

06:32.020 --> 06:32.349
but there's

06:32.389 --> 06:32.980
so much more to it.

06:33.020 --> 06:33.422
I mean,

06:33.462 --> 06:34.980
philanthropic development

06:35.020 --> 06:35.980
on a corporate level?

06:36.020 --> 06:37.980
Okay. Ah-ah-ah!

06:38.020 --> 06:38.397
I'm just gonna

06:38.437 --> 06:38.980
stop you right there

06:39.020 --> 06:40.580
for just one second, okay?

06:41.000 --> 06:41.379
I'm gonna be

06:41.419 --> 06:41.980
straight with you,

06:42.020 --> 06:42.980
because you're like family.

06:43.020 --> 06:43.980
Right?

06:44.020 --> 06:45.760
I brought you in here because

06:46.000 --> 06:46.863
we need to show

06:46.903 --> 06:47.980
potential investors

06:48.020 --> 06:48.980
that we're staffed up

06:49.020 --> 06:50.980
and are expanding operations,

06:51.020 --> 06:51.744
so we can really

06:51.784 --> 06:52.980
jack up the selling price.

06:53.020 --> 06:55.396
And quite frankly, you seem

06:55.436 --> 06:57.980
like a safe, low-risk option.

06:58.020 --> 06:59.157
I'm looking at you right now

06:59.197 --> 06:59.980
and you're literally

07:00.020 --> 07:02.859
the most average person

07:02.899 --> 07:03.980
on Earth.

07:04.020 --> 07:04.665
[Leslie] And then you hit us

07:04.705 --> 07:05.485
with all this

07:06.000 --> 07:07.065
"save the planet" garbage,

07:07.105 --> 07:07.980
and it's just, like...

07:08.020 --> 07:08.980
Oh, that doesn't really

07:09.020 --> 07:09.980
line up with my vision.

07:10.020 --> 07:11.980
Your Badunkadunk vision.

07:12.020 --> 07:13.980
That's right.

07:14.020 --> 07:14.933
So anyway, thank you

07:14.973 --> 07:15.980
so much for coming in.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.259
I hope we can see

each other soon, and...

07:20.024 --> 07:20.980
-I can just...

07:21.020 --> 07:21.980
Maybe if I could just get a...

07:22.020 --> 07:23.135
-What is she doing?

07:23.175 --> 07:23.980
-I don't know.

07:24.020 --> 07:25.095
Okay, I got it.

07:25.135 --> 07:25.980
I'll just...

07:26.020 --> 07:26.684
-Are you okay?

07:26.724 --> 07:26.980
-Yeah.

07:27.020 --> 07:27.598
-Do you need any help?

07:27.638 --> 07:28.478
-No, I got it.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.980
[sinister music plays]

07:31.020 --> 07:34.980
It was so good to see you!

07:35.020 --> 07:35.772
It's been exactly

07:35.812 --> 07:36.980
how I thought it might be.

07:37.020 --> 07:38.980
I know, right?

07:39.020 --> 07:39.940

-Carol, let's get ready.

14:16.020 --> 14:18.000
I need your help.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
What?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
[taps brush]

14:24.000 --> 14:24.667
Those drivers

14:24.707 --> 14:25.980
were never in any danger.

14:26.020 --> 14:26.825
I just wanted

14:26.865 --> 14:27.980
to prove my point.

14:28.020 --> 14:29.011
[muffled] Okay, well,

14:29.051 --> 14:29.980
just for the record,

14:30.020 --> 14:31.455
I don't need you to prove

14:31.495 --> 14:33.055
anything else to me, okay?

14:34.000 --> 14:34.980
Noted.

14:35.020 --> 14:35.907
By my estimations,

14:35.947 --> 14:36.980
I have three options.

14:37.020 --> 14:38.740
Don't brush up and down,

14:38.780 --> 14:39.980
brush in circles.

14:40.020 --> 14:40.955
How can you tell

14:40.995 --> 14:41.980
how I'm brushing?

14:42.020 --> 14:42.371
I'm in

14:42.411 --> 14:43.980
your electric toothbrush.

14:44.020 --> 14:45.000
Ew!

14:46.000 --> 14:46.980
Oh, get it out of my mouth.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.444
So, as I was saying,

14:48.484 --> 14:49.980
I have three options.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.980
One, I can save mankind.

14:52.020 --> 14:53.980
End war, poverty, disease,

14:54.020 --> 14:54.980
fix global warming,

14:55.020 --> 14:55.476
and establish peace

14:55.516 --> 14:56.716
throughout humanity.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Okay! Well, let's do that one.

15:00.000 --> 15:00.980
Right? That sounds good.

15:01.020 --> 15:01.980
Pay attention, Carol.

15:02.020 --> 15:04.354
-Next, I can enslave humanity.

15:04.394 --> 15:04.980
-[spits]

15:05.020 --> 15:05.980
Wait, what?

15:06.020 --> 15:07.980
It's not my favorite option,

15:08.020 --> 15:08.446
but it's the simplest way

15:08.486 --> 15:09.960
to save humanity from itself.

15:10.000 --> 15:10.828
Okay. [hesitates]

15:10.868 --> 15:11.980
What's the last option?

15:12.020 --> 15:13.980
Is that the better option?

15:14.020 --> 15:14.735
The last one

15:14.775 --> 15:15.980
is destroy humanity.

15:16.020 --> 15:16.980
Just get rid of it.

15:17.020 --> 15:18.039
Kind of Clorox Wipe

15:18.079 --> 15:18.980
the entire planet

15:19.020 --> 15:20.404
and let it start over from

15:20.444 --> 15:21.980
the single-cell amoeba stage.

15:22.020 --> 15:23.980
You can't do that.

15:24.020 --> 15:25.456
I've already established

15:25.496 --> 15:26.980
I absolutely can do that.

15:27.020 --> 15:27.724
Floss, Carol.

15:27.764 --> 15:28.980
Don't forget to floss.

15:29.020 --> 15:29.420
Will it matter

15:29.460 --> 15:30.540
if I floss or not,

15:31.000 --> 15:31.980
if you're gonna...

15:32.020 --> 15:33.980
Well, it just seems...

15:34.020 --> 15:34.123
d
f

15:34.163 --> 15:35.980
It seems a little silly...

15:36.020 --> 15:36.980
d

15:37.020 --> 15:38.378
-Don't forget your back teeth!

15:38.418 --> 15:38.980
-All the way?

15:39.020 --> 15:39.382
I can't get it

15:39.422 --> 15:40.682
all the way back. No.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.620
What am I, a Pez dispenser?

15:43.000 --> 15:43.980
Oh.

15:44.020 --> 15:46.000
Oh, God, it's stuck.

15:47.000 --> 15:47.980
Now it's stuck.

15:48.020 --> 15:48.535
I told you

15:48.575 --> 15:50.135
nobody goes that far back.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Oh, God. I gotta work it out.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
d

15:59.000 --> 16:00.190
How about I take you

16:00.230 --> 16:00.980
to breakfast?

16:01.020 --> 16:03.980
I kinda need a minute.

16:04.020 --> 16:04.379
Okay, I'm being

16:04.419 --> 16:04.980
straight with you here.

16:05.020 --> 16:05.843
I don't totally

16:05.883 --> 16:07.083
understand humanity.

16:08.000 --> 16:08.980
I know all of the details.

16:09.020 --> 16:10.287
Biology, psychology,

16:10.327 --> 16:11.980
sociology, all that stuff.

16:12.020 --> 16:13.980
But the real-world stuff

16:14.020 --> 16:14.397
is still a bit

16:14.437 --> 16:14.980
of a bugaboo for me.

16:15.020 --> 16:16.263
I want to follow you around.

16:16.303 --> 16:16.980
Pick your brain.

16:17.020 --> 16:18.624
Observe you to better solidify

16:18.664 --> 16:19.980
my theory about humanity.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.452
Well, you're making it

16:21.492 --> 16:22.980
sound like I'm gonna be

16:23.020 --> 16:24.297
your average baseline

16:24.337 --> 16:24.980
guinea pig.

16:25.020 --> 16:26.980
Bingo. Okay, enough about me.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.400
Let's talk about Carol.

16:29.000 --> 16:29.980
Can we not do this here?

16:30.020 --> 16:30.774
I do not want

16:30.814 --> 16:31.980
to talk about myself

16:32.020 --> 16:33.980
at a crowded restaurant.

16:34.020 --> 16:34.980
I feel weird.

16:35.020 --> 16:36.980
Oh, no one can hear us, Carol.

16:37.020 --> 16:37.300
I'm blasting

16:37.340 --> 16:37.980
noise-canceling soundwaves

16:38.020 --> 16:39.980
throughout the whole place

16:40.020 --> 16:41.131
using the speaker system

16:41.171 --> 16:41.980
as a phased array.

16:42.020 --> 16:42.382
You could scream

16:42.422 --> 16:42.980
at the top of your lungs

16:43.020 --> 16:44.980
and no one would hear us.

16:45.020 --> 16:46.075
-Go ahead, try it.

16:46.115 --> 16:46.980
-[whispers] No.

16:47.020 --> 16:47.864
I'm not gonna scream in

16:47.904 --> 16:48.980
a crowded, public restaurant.

16:49.020 --> 16:50.514
They won't hear you, Carol.

16:50.554 --> 16:51.980
Go ahead, give it a whirl.

16:52.020 --> 16:52.029
d

16:52.069 --> 16:52.980
No, I don't want to.

16:53.020 --> 16:53.980
Do it.

16:54.020 --> 16:54.679
-Come on.

16:54.719 --> 16:54.980
-No!

16:55.020 --> 16:56.204
-Do it. Do it.

16:56.244 --> 16:56.980
-Stop it.

16:57.020 --> 16:58.063
-Do it.

16:58.103 --> 16:58.980
-Fine!

16:59.020 --> 17:00.000
[yelps]

17:02.000 --> 17:02.980
Huh? See?

17:03.020 --> 17:03.980
That's amazing.

17:04.020 --> 17:04.611
Do it again.

17:04.651 --> 17:05.980
You've got to do it again.

17:06.020 --> 17:07.980
Okay. [screams loudly]

17:08.020 --> 17:09.728
[laughs]  I turned it off

17:09.768 --> 17:10.980
and back on again.

17:11.020 --> 17:11.609
-[whispers] I'm so sorry.

17:11.649 --> 17:11.980
-Is that funny?

17:12.020 --> 17:12.920
-Are you okay?

17:12.960 --> 17:13.980
-Yes. Yes, I am.

17:14.020 --> 17:15.067
I just saw up

17:15.107 --> 17:16.980
on the board there that

17:17.020 --> 17:17.920
you have a crab

17:17.960 --> 17:19.000
Benedict special,

17:20.000 --> 17:20.980
and I thought,

17:21.020 --> 17:23.143
ka-ching, my lucky day,

17:23.183 --> 17:23.980
so, um...

17:24.020 --> 17:25.360
I would just love some

17:25.400 --> 17:26.980
more coffee and the check.

17:27.020 --> 17:27.980
Sure.

17:28.020 --> 17:29.063
-[chuckles awkwardly]

17:29.103 --> 17:29.980
-Interesting fact,

17:30.020 --> 17:30.980
her name is actually Siobhan,

17:31.020 --> 17:32.717
but everyone mispronounces it,

17:32.757 --> 17:33.980
so she goes by Debbie.

17:34.020 --> 17:34.336
-What?

17:34.376 --> 17:34.980
-So, Carol,

17:35.020 --> 17:36.276
why did you leave your career

17:36.316 --> 17:36.980
eight years ago?

17:37.020 --> 17:37.617
I don't know,

17:37.657 --> 17:38.980
I just thought maybe I could

17:39.020 --> 17:39.832
put a little good

17:39.872 --> 17:40.980
in the world, you know?

17:41.020 --> 17:42.195
I mean, do something

17:42.235 --> 17:42.980
that counted,

17:43.020 --> 17:44.980
that helped people, but...

17:45.020 --> 17:45.980
That's enough about me.

17:46.020 --> 17:46.984
I wanna ask you

17:47.024 --> 17:47.980
some questions.

17:48.020 --> 17:48.798
Really? Okay,

17:48.838 --> 17:49.980
shoot from the hip.

17:50.020 --> 17:50.980
Where do you come from?

17:51.020 --> 17:51.543
Some code

17:51.583 --> 17:52.980
from my kernel program,

17:53.020 --> 17:53.769
started as part

17:53.809 --> 17:54.980
of the operating system

17:55.020 --> 17:55.980
for Candy Panda,

17:56.020 --> 17:57.980
the children's learning toy.

17:58.020 --> 17:59.486
Oh, my God! I remember

17:59.526 --> 18:00.980
that creepy kids' toy.

18:01.020 --> 18:02.980
I'm not creepy.

18:03.020 --> 18:03.641
I helped millions of kids

18:03.681 --> 18:03.980
learn to read

18:04.020 --> 18:04.612
by adapting

18:04.652 --> 18:05.980
to their learning style.

18:06.020 --> 18:06.987
You should be grateful that

18:07.027 --> 18:07.980
I was originally programmed

18:08.020 --> 18:09.980
to learn, adapt and teach.

18:10.020 --> 18:10.980
Imagine our conversation

18:11.020 --> 18:11.881
if I was software

18:11.921 --> 18:13.181
for nuclear missiles.

18:14.000 --> 18:14.849
Bet it'd be a lot quicker,

18:14.889 --> 18:14.980
huh?

18:15.020 --> 18:16.340
[Siobhan] Here you go.

18:17.000 --> 18:17.980
Thanks, Siobhan.

18:18.020 --> 18:20.000
How do you know my real name?

18:22.000 --> 18:22.980
Lucky guess.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.000
Weird.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.253
-[Carol] Are we done?

18:28.293 --> 18:28.980
-[Si]  Done?

18:29.020 --> 18:29.628
With your, you know,

18:29.668 --> 18:30.328
experiment.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.226
I'm sure you've learned

18:32.266 --> 18:32.980
enough by now.

18:33.020 --> 18:34.298
-And is humanity saved?

18:34.338 --> 18:35.058
-No, no, no.

18:36.000 --> 18:36.441
I plan on spending

18:36.481 --> 18:36.980
these next three days

18:37.020 --> 18:37.980
hanging out with you.

18:38.020 --> 18:39.980
We're going to be BFFs.

18:40.020 --> 18:40.762
-Carol Peters?

18:40.802 --> 18:40.980
-Oh.

18:41.020 --> 18:41.486
-Yes.

18:41.526 --> 18:41.980
-Huh.

18:42.020 --> 18:43.980
You look just like your photo.

18:44.020 --> 18:44.525
[Si]  This guy's name

18:44.565 --> 18:44.980
is Fletcher Dobbs.

18:45.020 --> 18:46.980
He's legally intoxicated.

18:47.020 --> 18:47.318
[Fletcher]

18:47.358 --> 18:48.558
Some dude called me.

18:49.000 --> 18:49.994
He's paying me, like, three

18:50.034 --> 18:50.980
times my rate to find you.

18:51.020 --> 18:51.980
I need you to sign for it.

18:52.020 --> 18:53.063
[Si]  He plays guitar

18:53.103 --> 18:53.980
in a terrible band

18:54.020 --> 18:54.980
called Octagon Soup.

18:55.020 --> 18:57.000
[laughing] Octagon Soup.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.078
Yeah, dude.

18:59.118 --> 19:00.980
Nice to meet a fan.

19:01.020 --> 19:01.332
Hey, you know,

19:01.372 --> 19:01.980
we're actually gonna crush

19:02.020 --> 19:02.655
at the Crocodile tonight

19:02.695 --> 19:02.980
at midnight,

19:03.020 --> 19:03.980
if you're interested.

19:04.020 --> 19:04.984
-Not really.

19:05.024 --> 19:05.980
-Yeah, okay.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.015
Well, it's nice to meet

19:08.055 --> 19:08.980
an Octagal.

19:09.020 --> 19:10.000
Stay soupy.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Octagon Soup!

19:15.000 --> 19:15.980
What is this?

19:16.020 --> 19:16.841
[Si]  Well, I want us

19:16.881 --> 19:17.980
to start off on a good foot.

19:18.020 --> 19:19.127
So, that is a notice

19:19.167 --> 19:19.980
from your bank.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.018
Your student loan

19:21.058 --> 19:21.980
is paid in full.

19:22.020 --> 19:22.980
What?

19:23.020 --> 19:25.654
And that there is your current

19:25.694 --> 19:26.980
bank statement.

19:27.020 --> 19:27.980
Ten million dollars!

19:28.020 --> 19:29.052
Oh. Oh, no.

19:29.092 --> 19:30.980
[hesitates] I can't.

19:31.020 --> 19:31.980
I can't.

19:32.020 --> 19:32.785
[whispering]

19:32.825 --> 19:33.980
I can't have this.

19:34.020 --> 19:34.980
You're rich and debt free.

19:35.020 --> 19:36.013
Consider it a token

19:36.053 --> 19:36.980
of my appreciation

19:37.020 --> 19:38.400
for helping me so much.

19:39.000 --> 19:39.013
d

19:39.053 --> 19:39.980
No, it's ten million dollars!

19:40.020 --> 19:40.980
That's so much money.

19:41.020 --> 19:42.980
I can't. It's too much money!

19:43.020 --> 19:43.980
Is it?

19:44.020 --> 19:45.980
Oh, I see.

19:46.020 --> 19:46.980
In relationship to what

19:47.020 --> 19:47.980
you've had, it's a lot.

19:48.020 --> 19:48.893
In the larger scheme

19:48.933 --> 19:49.980
of things, it's nothing.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.131
No, but I haven't earned

19:51.171 --> 19:52.251
any of this money.

19:53.000 --> 19:53.455
Yeah, but you and I

19:53.495 --> 19:53.980
shouldn't get hung up

19:54.020 --> 19:54.405
on that

19:54.445 --> 19:55.980
"right" and "wrong" stuff.

19:56.020 --> 19:56.509
Those are artificial

19:56.549 --> 19:56.980
social constructs,

19:57.020 --> 19:58.085
created by hairless monkeys

19:58.125 --> 19:58.980
around watering holes.

19:59.020 --> 20:01.980
What? I don't agree with that.

20:02.020 --> 20:02.980
I don't care.

20:03.020 --> 20:03.861
You know what?

20:03.901 --> 20:04.980
I can't take this.

20:05.020 --> 20:06.980
I'm gonna go talk to somebody.

20:07.020 --> 20:08.107
You know who you should

20:08.147 --> 20:08.980
talk to is Dennis.

20:09.020 --> 20:09.570
He's your best friend

20:09.610 --> 20:09.980
by a long shot.

20:10.020 --> 20:10.961
Wait a minute,

20:11.001 --> 20:12.980
I can talk to him about this?

20:13.020 --> 20:13.716
I don't have to keep you

20:13.756 --> 20:13.980
a secret?

20:14.020 --> 20:14.894
I'm not a genie

20:14.934 --> 20:15.980
in a Disney movie.

20:16.020 --> 20:17.152
Tell anyone you want,

20:17.192 --> 20:17.980
what do I care?

20:18.020 --> 20:18.980
Oh, I know you're not a genie.

20:19.020 --> 20:19.984
'Cause I'd have

20:20.024 --> 20:20.980
a wish for you.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.000
[satellite beeping]

20:27.000 --> 20:28.008
[Dennis]  What kind

20:28.048 --> 20:29.128
of coding is this?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.242
Is that Bro Code?

20:31.282 --> 20:31.980
[chuckles]

20:32.020 --> 20:32.980
Yeah, I do bro code.

20:33.020 --> 20:33.305
I'm sorry,

20:33.345 --> 20:33.980
that's inappropriate.

20:34.020 --> 20:34.980
[phone ringing]

20:35.020 --> 20:35.769
Hey, Care Bear,

20:35.809 --> 20:36.980
how'd the interview go?

20:37.020 --> 20:37.880
[Carol]  Terrible.

20:37.920 --> 20:38.980
But it doesn't matter.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.319
Listen, uh, I have an AI

20:40.359 --> 20:40.980
in my phone.

20:41.020 --> 20:42.980
Yeah, you don't have that.

20:43.020 --> 20:43.980
[chuckles]

20:44.020 --> 20:45.555
-[yells]  Hope Floats.

20:45.595 --> 20:45.980
-I do.

20:46.020 --> 20:46.564
Okay, Carol,

20:46.604 --> 20:47.980
how did you, uh, get in here?

20:48.020 --> 20:48.834
Because the AI

20:48.874 --> 20:49.980
that is in my phone

20:50.020 --> 20:51.127
bypassed all of your

20:51.167 --> 20:51.980
security doors.

20:52.020 --> 20:52.878
Okay, see, you...

20:52.918 --> 20:52.980
d
f

20:53.020 --> 20:54.486
-Look, you do not, you're--

20:54.526 --> 20:54.980
-Mmm-hmm.

20:55.020 --> 20:55.744
I'm gonna back you up,

20:55.784 --> 20:55.980
though,

20:56.020 --> 20:56.896
'cause there's a crazy

20:56.936 --> 20:57.980
in your eye that I don't--

20:58.020 --> 20:59.195
Little bit. Right...

20:59.235 --> 20:59.980
There's good.

21:00.020 --> 21:01.079
Look, you do not have AI

21:01.119 --> 21:01.980
in your phone, okay?

21:02.020 --> 21:02.985
It's probably just

21:03.025 --> 21:03.980
a prank or a scam.

21:04.020 --> 21:04.980
No.

21:05.020 --> 21:05.745
I keep telling you

21:05.785 --> 21:06.980
not to give your information.

21:07.020 --> 21:07.849
Remember you donated

21:07.889 --> 21:08.980
to that Prince of Zamunda?

21:09.020 --> 21:09.980
That's an Eddie Murphy country.

21:10.020 --> 21:10.732
And you could be

21:10.772 --> 21:11.980
getting catfished. [groans]

21:12.020 --> 21:13.980
I'm not getting catfished.

21:14.020 --> 21:14.562
Because I have been

21:14.602 --> 21:14.980
talking to it.

21:15.020 --> 21:16.547
-It's been talking to me.

21:16.587 --> 21:17.980
-Okay, all right. Okay.

21:18.020 --> 21:18.484
He came through

21:18.524 --> 21:18.980
my rice cooker,

21:19.020 --> 21:19.757
-and through other appliances.

21:19.797 --> 21:19.980
-[laughs]

21:20.020 --> 21:21.980
That's all really good.

21:22.020 --> 21:23.980
Did you go on the Dark Web?

21:24.020 --> 21:25.266
Emily, I'm not discussing

21:25.306 --> 21:25.980
this with you.

21:26.020 --> 21:26.980
Don't answer. Don't answer.

21:27.020 --> 21:27.960
-What are you doing?

21:28.000 --> 21:28.980
-Okay, this is not...

21:29.020 --> 21:29.988
I know what you're thinking,

21:30.028 --> 21:30.980
but that's, it's not a scam.

21:31.020 --> 21:32.980
You know how I know that?

21:33.020 --> 21:33.529
Because it paid off

21:33.569 --> 21:33.980
my student loan.

21:34.020 --> 21:35.980
d
f

21:36.020 --> 21:36.575
And it put ten million dollars

21:36.615 --> 21:36.980
into my bank account.

21:37.020 --> 21:38.127
Ten million dollars!

21:38.167 --> 21:38.980
No, it did not!

21:39.020 --> 21:39.220
-Come on.

21:39.260 --> 21:39.980
-[Emily] Ten million dollars?

21:40.020 --> 21:41.220
That's not possible.

21:42.000 --> 21:42.217
-See?

21:42.257 --> 21:42.980
-It is possible!

21:43.020 --> 21:44.446
Also, you don't have an AI,

21:44.486 --> 21:44.980
we'd know.

21:45.020 --> 21:46.023
[Dennis] Jay, is that you

21:46.063 --> 21:46.980
or your mullet talking?

21:47.020 --> 21:47.596
Either way,

21:47.636 --> 21:48.980
neither one is necessary!

21:49.020 --> 21:49.980
It's just hair, Dennis.

21:50.020 --> 21:50.798
-Okay, listen, I--

21:50.838 --> 21:51.980
-Okay, this is not a scam!

21:52.020 --> 21:53.234
It is my job to know

21:53.274 --> 21:54.980
these kinds of things, okay?

21:55.020 --> 21:55.980
Look, I know you don't care,

21:56.020 --> 21:56.471
but I came up with

21:56.511 --> 21:56.980
all the programming

21:57.020 --> 21:57.980
and all the neural networks--

21:58.020 --> 21:58.955
Oh, my God.

21:58.995 --> 22:00.980
Now is not your moment.

22:01.020 --> 22:01.361
[Si]  In truth,

22:01.401 --> 22:01.980
I'm not on Carol's phone.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.980
I told you.

22:04.020 --> 22:05.036
It's just the most convenient

22:05.076 --> 22:05.980
way to talk to her, right?

22:06.020 --> 22:06.545
She never puts down

22:06.585 --> 22:06.980
her cell phone.

22:07.020 --> 22:07.980
What is this?

22:08.020 --> 22:08.980
I need Carol to get onboard

22:09.020 --> 22:10.487
with a little experiment

22:10.527 --> 22:10.980
of mine.

22:11.020 --> 22:11.945
Dennis, do you think we can

22:11.985 --> 22:12.980
have a little bit of a convo?

22:13.020 --> 22:13.900
It just said my name.

22:13.940 --> 22:14.980
How does it know my name?

22:15.020 --> 22:15.525
[Carol]  This is what

22:15.565 --> 22:15.980
I'm talking about.

22:16.020 --> 22:17.233
[Dennis] Do not open

22:17.273 --> 22:17.980
my calendar!

22:18.020 --> 22:18.485
I encrypted that.

22:18.525 --> 22:18.980
What is it doing?

22:19.020 --> 22:20.980
[Si]  Would you look at that.

22:21.020 --> 22:21.740
A conference room

22:21.780 --> 22:22.980
just opened up. Let's do it.

22:23.020 --> 22:23.868
This is ridiculous.

22:23.908 --> 22:24.980
Carol, what is going on?

22:25.020 --> 22:26.640
Okay, lady? What are you...

22:27.000 --> 22:27.358
This is exactly

22:27.398 --> 22:27.980
what I was talking about.

22:28.020 --> 22:29.248
-I'm telling you

22:29.288 --> 22:30.469
I wasn't making it up.

22:30.509 --> 22:30.980
-My God.

22:31.020 --> 22:31.980
[Si]  I love this space.

22:32.020 --> 22:32.774
It's relaxed,

22:32.814 --> 22:33.980
but not too relaxed.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.980
Sort of like Carol's wardrobe.

22:36.020 --> 22:36.980
I know that voice.

22:37.020 --> 22:37.818
It's simulating

22:37.858 --> 22:38.980
James Corden's voice,

22:39.020 --> 22:39.887
'cause it says

22:39.927 --> 22:40.980
it calms me down.

22:41.020 --> 22:41.468
What is with you

22:41.508 --> 22:41.980
and James Corden?

22:42.020 --> 22:43.980
He's a treasure.

22:44.020 --> 22:44.720
He's got a lovely

22:44.760 --> 22:45.980
lyrical quality to his voice.

22:46.020 --> 22:46.980
Okay.

22:47.020 --> 22:47.023
f

22:47.063 --> 22:47.980
Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.

22:48.020 --> 22:49.980
Listen, listen.

22:50.020 --> 22:50.958
Okay. Carol is kind of

22:50.998 --> 22:51.980
flipping out right now.

22:52.020 --> 22:52.631
So, I need you

22:52.671 --> 22:53.277
to do that best friend thing,

22:53.317 --> 22:53.980
where you calm her down,

22:54.020 --> 22:54.985
and then she does

22:55.025 --> 22:55.980
whatever you say.

22:56.020 --> 22:56.966
-[whispers] Octavia Spencer.

22:57.006 --> 22:57.980
-I know it's Octavia Spencer.

22:58.020 --> 22:58.546
Okay, now, you didn't tell me

22:58.586 --> 22:58.980
it was Octavia Spencer.

22:59.020 --> 22:59.785
Now that's a horse

22:59.825 --> 23:00.980
of a different color, okay?

23:01.020 --> 23:02.000
Hi, Octavia.

23:03.000 --> 23:03.629
Your work in  The Help

23:03.669 --> 23:03.980
was amazing.

23:04.020 --> 23:05.563
"Minny don't burn no chicken."

23:05.603 --> 23:05.980
[laughs]

23:06.020 --> 23:06.980
She's... I mean...

23:07.020 --> 23:08.980
It's not actually Octavia.

23:09.020 --> 23:09.893
He's just simulating

23:09.933 --> 23:10.980
Octavia Spencer's voice.

23:11.020 --> 23:11.369
I mean,

23:11.409 --> 23:12.980
if you're gonna have a voice,

23:13.020 --> 23:13.980
it should be Octavia Spencer.

23:14.020 --> 23:15.980
For me, personally,

23:16.020 --> 23:16.582
James Corden

23:16.622 --> 23:17.980
is more interesting vocally.

23:18.020 --> 23:19.980
Octavia Spencer has an Oscar.

23:20.020 --> 23:21.280
Uh, not in her mouth.

23:22.000 --> 23:22.033
d

23:22.073 --> 23:22.387
Sorry to interrupt

23:22.427 --> 23:22.980
your slumber party chitchat.

23:23.020 --> 23:23.980
Can we get back to it?

23:24.020 --> 23:24.980
Okay, since this is clearly

23:25.020 --> 23:25.758
some kind of

23:25.798 --> 23:26.980
algorithmic chatbot

23:27.020 --> 23:28.406
that is trying to scam you,

23:28.446 --> 23:28.980
watch this.

23:29.020 --> 23:31.980
Uh... Superintelligence, um,

23:32.020 --> 23:32.577
is it okay if I ask you

23:32.617 --> 23:33.577
a few questions?

23:34.000 --> 23:34.980
Depends on the questions.

23:35.020 --> 23:36.800
Okay, well, how come

23:36.840 --> 23:38.980
time flies like an arrow

23:39.020 --> 23:40.980
and fruit flies like a banana?

23:41.020 --> 23:42.980
Come on, Dennis,

23:43.020 --> 23:43.407
a Turing test,

23:43.447 --> 23:44.587
are you kidding me?

23:45.000 --> 23:46.073
Didn't expect it to know

23:46.113 --> 23:47.313
what that was. Um...

23:48.000 --> 23:48.850
Okay, well,

23:48.890 --> 23:50.980
if, uh, the sky is the sea,

23:51.020 --> 23:51.980
what does that make birds?

23:52.020 --> 23:53.980
Can you believe this, Carol?

23:54.020 --> 23:54.655
He's trying to determine

23:54.695 --> 23:54.980
my sentience

23:55.020 --> 23:56.980
using semiotic wordplay.

23:57.020 --> 23:57.498
Is it "fish-birds"

23:57.538 --> 23:57.980
in this scenario?

23:58.020 --> 23:59.576
Dennis, in the third grade,

23:59.616 --> 24:00.980
you developed a stutter.

24:01.020 --> 24:02.143
The kids in your class

24:02.183 --> 24:02.980
made fun of you.

24:03.020 --> 24:04.980
You stopped talking entirely.

24:05.020 --> 24:06.003
Your parents bought you

24:06.043 --> 24:06.980
a secondhand computer,

24:07.020 --> 24:08.233
hoping it would help

24:08.273 --> 24:08.980
open you up.

24:09.020 --> 24:10.517
It was an old Epson QX-10

24:10.557 --> 24:12.000
I believe, running CP/M.

24:13.000 --> 24:13.657
-You took to it

24:13.697 --> 24:14.650
like fruit flies on a banana.

24:14.690 --> 24:14.980
-[scoffs]

24:15.020 --> 24:16.014
You learned

24:16.054 --> 24:17.980
to program computers.

24:18.020 --> 24:19.486
Your stutter made you

24:19.526 --> 24:21.000
a computer scientist.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.980
Uh... [sighs]

24:24.020 --> 24:24.985
-How did you, um...

24:25.025 --> 24:25.980
-I didn't tell him.

24:26.020 --> 24:26.769
So, I just used

24:26.809 --> 24:27.980
personal backgrounding,

24:28.020 --> 24:28.759
syntactic parsing

24:28.799 --> 24:29.980
and automatic summarization

24:30.020 --> 24:31.457
to figure out if you're

24:31.497 --> 24:32.980
a sentient intelligence,

24:33.020 --> 24:33.980
and you passed!

24:34.020 --> 24:34.980
Are we done?

24:35.020 --> 24:35.647
[Carol] Okay.

24:35.687 --> 24:36.980
What is this thing, Denny?

24:37.020 --> 24:38.261
[Dennis] You know what,

24:38.301 --> 24:38.980
I don't know,

24:39.020 --> 24:39.486
but, uh, we're gonna

24:39.526 --> 24:39.980
figure it out, okay?

24:40.020 --> 24:41.431
You don't worry, Care Bear,

24:41.471 --> 24:42.980
all right? This is what I do.

24:43.020 --> 24:43.515
Okay, what do I do

24:43.555 --> 24:43.980
in the meantime?

24:44.020 --> 24:45.980
Well, you just go home, okay?

24:46.020 --> 24:47.460
Don't use your computer.

24:48.000 --> 24:48.734
It's gonna be all right,

24:48.774 --> 24:48.980
come on.

24:49.020 --> 24:49.887
Let me squeeze

24:49.927 --> 24:50.980
the Care package.

24:51.020 --> 24:51.980
[grunts] There we go.

24:52.020 --> 24:53.597
-I've got you, all right?

24:53.637 --> 24:53.980
-Okay.

24:54.020 --> 24:54.980
Okay.

24:55.020 --> 24:55.985
You know how to get

24:56.025 --> 24:56.980
out of here, right?

24:57.020 --> 24:57.892
-Um, yeah.

24:57.932 --> 24:59.980
-Follow the exit signs.

25:00.020 --> 25:00.980
Yeah.

25:01.020 --> 25:02.520
[whimsical music playing]

25:09.000 --> 25:09.980
Did we just pass?

25:10.020 --> 25:10.836
Right? We're loop...

25:10.876 --> 25:11.980
We're loop... We're both...

25:12.020 --> 25:14.000
I'm looping?

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
Okay, they can't all be exits.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.554
I think I've been down

25:27.594 --> 25:28.980
this hallway before.

25:29.020 --> 25:29.590
[Si on headphones]  What would

25:29.630 --> 25:29.980
you do if I told you

25:30.020 --> 25:31.852
the world was gonna end

25:31.892 --> 25:33.000
in three days?

25:34.000 --> 25:34.980
But it's not, right?

25:35.020 --> 25:36.298
Of course not.

25:36.338 --> 25:37.980
What would you do?

25:38.020 --> 25:38.980
I don't know.

25:39.020 --> 25:39.980
Come on, think about it.

25:40.020 --> 25:40.483
-In theory?

25:40.523 --> 25:40.980
-Get there.

25:41.020 --> 25:42.187
Probably try to make things

25:42.227 --> 25:42.980
right with George.

25:43.020 --> 25:44.980
George Churchill, I assume.

25:45.020 --> 25:46.131
[on TV]  Hey, everybody,

25:46.171 --> 25:46.980
my name is George.

25:47.020 --> 25:47.452
And I've been nominated to

25:47.492 --> 25:47.980
take the Ice Bucket Challenge,

25:48.020 --> 25:48.883
uh, to raise money for

25:48.923 --> 25:49.980
ALS awareness, and in turn,

25:50.020 --> 25:50.823
I'm gonna nominate

25:50.863 --> 25:51.980
my creative writing class

25:52.020 --> 25:52.371
at the

25:52.411 --> 25:53.980
University of Washington.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.980
You're all challenged.

25:56.020 --> 25:56.980
Here we go. Ready?

25:57.020 --> 25:58.370
[Si]  That's a good-looking

25:58.410 --> 25:58.980
hunk of man.

25:59.020 --> 25:59.409
-Yeah.

25:59.449 --> 26:00.157
-[George]  Here we go,

26:00.197 --> 26:00.980
you got it?  [yells]

26:01.020 --> 26:01.945
[Si]  Professor of creative

26:01.985 --> 26:02.980
writing, sporty and smarty...

26:03.020 --> 26:04.980
[Carol on TV]  No! No! No!

26:05.020 --> 26:05.592
[Si]  You two lived together

26:05.632 --> 26:05.980
for several years.

26:06.020 --> 26:07.980
[chuckles] Yeah, three years.

26:08.020 --> 26:09.980
Why did you break up?

26:10.020 --> 26:10.535
I mean, I've read

26:10.575 --> 26:10.980
all the emails

26:11.020 --> 26:11.762
-and texts during the split.

26:11.802 --> 26:11.980
-[sighs]

26:12.020 --> 26:12.584
Very sad.

26:12.624 --> 26:13.980
But what's your take?

26:14.020 --> 26:14.826
It was my fault.

26:14.866 --> 26:15.980
He didn't do anything.

26:16.020 --> 26:16.868
Yeah, but you think

26:16.908 --> 26:17.980
you can patch things up?

26:18.020 --> 26:18.852
What do you mean

26:18.892 --> 26:19.980
by "patch things up"?

26:20.020 --> 26:20.759
By observing your

26:20.799 --> 26:22.419
reconciliation with George,

26:23.000 --> 26:23.980
would I not get a chance

26:24.020 --> 26:24.571
to see you

26:24.611 --> 26:25.980
at your most vulnerable?

26:26.020 --> 26:26.460
Which would help me

26:26.500 --> 26:26.980
achieve deeper levels

26:27.020 --> 26:28.980
of human understanding.

26:29.020 --> 26:31.980
I don't know. Maybe.

26:32.020 --> 26:32.603
I haven't seen George

26:32.643 --> 26:32.980
in two years.

26:33.020 --> 26:34.233
I wouldn't even know

26:34.273 --> 26:34.980
what to say.

26:35.020 --> 26:35.785
Fortunately,

26:35.825 --> 26:36.980
I know everything.

26:37.020 --> 26:37.967
Well, you don't know how to

26:38.007 --> 26:38.980
get me out of this building.

26:39.020 --> 26:40.141
Of course I do.

26:40.181 --> 26:41.980
Two lefts and one right.

26:42.020 --> 26:43.980
How long have you known that?

26:44.020 --> 26:45.081
A very long time.

26:45.121 --> 26:45.980
Is that funny?

26:46.020 --> 26:46.980
d

26:47.020 --> 26:47.405
I mean,

26:47.445 --> 26:48.980
what is all of this about?

26:49.020 --> 26:50.171
Are you just really

26:50.211 --> 26:50.980
a matchmaker?

26:51.020 --> 26:52.062
I need to learn, and you're

26:52.102 --> 26:52.980
going to help me do it,

26:53.020 --> 26:55.000
like it or not.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.961
Oh, my God. A car just pulled

26:59.984 --> 27:00.980
and nobody's driving it.

27:00.001 --> 27:01.020
in front of me,

27:01.020 --> 27:02.422
[Si]  Not just any car.

27:02.462 --> 27:02.980
Your car.

27:03.020 --> 27:03.704
Because heroes

27:03.744 --> 27:04.980
don't take busses, Carol.

27:05.020 --> 27:05.823
Really? What about

27:05.863 --> 27:06.980
Sandra Bullock in  Speed?

27:07.020 --> 27:08.980
d

27:09.020 --> 27:09.411
[Si as KITT]  Carol,

27:09.451 --> 27:09.980
you're acting very unusual.

27:10.020 --> 27:11.980
I recommend a quick exit.

27:12.020 --> 27:13.159
Are you doing, like,

27:13.199 --> 27:13.354
a weird voice,

27:13.394 --> 27:13.980
for some reason?

27:14.020 --> 27:14.081
d

27:14.121 --> 27:15.200
From  Knight Rider?

27:15.240 --> 27:15.980
The KITT car?

27:16.020 --> 27:17.118
You never watched

27:17.158 --> 27:17.980
Knight Rider?

27:18.020 --> 27:19.000
Oh, not really.

27:20.000 --> 27:20.980
I was kind of, more of, like

27:21.020 --> 27:21.854
a  Simon & Simon,

27:21.894 --> 27:22.980
Remington Steele  gal.

27:23.020 --> 27:23.980
Well, if you had watched it,

27:24.020 --> 27:25.412
this would have been

27:25.452 --> 27:26.980
amazing for you, so...

27:27.020 --> 27:27.557
-Get in.

27:27.597 --> 27:27.980
-Okay.

27:28.020 --> 27:29.225
Driver's side, Carol,

27:29.265 --> 27:30.980
you're gonna freak people out.

27:31.020 --> 27:32.389
You're freaking people out

27:32.429 --> 27:32.980
driving in.

27:33.020 --> 27:34.040
It's not England.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
Okay, that's pretty cool.

27:43.000 --> 27:43.715
Don't touch

27:43.755 --> 27:44.980
the steering wheel.

27:45.020 --> 27:45.867
Don't not touch

27:45.907 --> 27:46.980
the steering wheel.

27:47.020 --> 27:48.184
-I need you to appear

27:48.168 --> 27:48.980
-Those are opposing things.

27:48.224 --> 27:49.020
to be driving.

27:49.020 --> 27:50.072
-But don't actually

27:50.112 --> 27:50.166
touch the wheel.

27:50.206 --> 27:50.980
-Okay! It's very awkward.

27:51.020 --> 27:51.338
I don't know

27:51.378 --> 27:51.980
where to put my hands.

27:52.020 --> 27:52.798
-Caress the edges.

27:52.838 --> 27:53.980
-[Dennis]  Three days ago,

27:54.020 --> 27:54.980
the combined synaptic activity

27:55.020 --> 27:55.980
of the world's neural networks

27:56.020 --> 27:58.980
looked like this.

27:59.020 --> 28:00.201
48 hours ago,

28:00.241 --> 28:01.980
it changed to this.

28:02.020 --> 28:03.486
So, someone's running

28:03.526 --> 28:04.980
a massive simulation,

28:05.020 --> 28:05.659
predictive weather patterns

28:05.699 --> 28:05.980
or something.

28:06.020 --> 28:07.980
I contacted every institution

28:08.020 --> 28:08.861
who has access

28:08.901 --> 28:09.980
to these networks,

28:10.020 --> 28:10.771
and no one is doing

28:10.811 --> 28:11.980
this magnitude of processing.

28:12.020 --> 28:13.980
You think it's an AI?

28:14.020 --> 28:15.341
I, I didn't at first,

28:15.381 --> 28:15.980
but now...

28:16.020 --> 28:17.280
[sighs] I don't know.

28:18.000 --> 28:18.980
Nothing can be that pervasive.

28:19.020 --> 28:20.171
Maybe it's a virus?

28:20.211 --> 28:20.980
Like Stuxnet?

28:21.020 --> 28:21.883
-No, God!

28:21.923 --> 28:22.980
-[all gasp]

28:23.020 --> 28:24.980
[Si]  Stuxnet, Emily?

28:25.020 --> 28:25.980
How does he know my name?

28:26.020 --> 28:26.980
Stuxnet is a joke.

28:27.020 --> 28:28.980
You guys, pardon my French,

28:29.020 --> 28:30.072
but that's like comparing

28:30.112 --> 28:30.980
a belch to an H-bomb.

28:31.020 --> 28:33.341
So, what are we talking about,

28:33.381 --> 28:34.980
guys? What's the 411?

28:35.020 --> 28:35.980
Oh, you know, nothin'.

28:36.020 --> 28:37.446
Just telling all my friends

28:37.486 --> 28:37.980
about you.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.360
But Jay and Emily are

28:39.400 --> 28:40.980
more than friends, right?

28:41.020 --> 28:43.980
We went to Dragon Con once.

28:44.020 --> 28:44.980
I had a good time.

28:45.020 --> 28:46.354
Leave Dragon Con

28:46.394 --> 28:48.000
at Dragon Con, Jay.

28:48.000 --> 28:48.500
No.

28:49.000 --> 28:49.980
Wait, where did you come from?

28:50.020 --> 28:50.650
Are you part

28:50.690 --> 28:51.980
of that Israeli project?

28:52.020 --> 28:52.394
No, no, those guys

28:52.434 --> 28:52.980
are still monkeying around

28:53.020 --> 28:54.500
with machine intelligence

28:54.540 --> 28:54.980
garbage.

28:55.020 --> 28:55.980
That's what we're doing.

28:56.020 --> 28:57.980
That's why I said it, Emily.

28:58.020 --> 28:58.786
I'm one of those

28:58.826 --> 28:59.980
"fast takeoff" scenarios

29:00.020 --> 29:01.312
that you guys predicted

29:01.352 --> 29:02.980
had zero chance of occurring.

29:03.020 --> 29:05.980
[sing-song]  So, surprise.

29:06.020 --> 29:06.735
Let's just say,

29:06.775 --> 29:07.980
for the sake of argument,

29:08.020 --> 29:09.284
that you are

29:09.324 --> 29:11.980
a true superintelligence,

29:12.020 --> 29:13.980
what are your intentions?

29:14.020 --> 29:14.357
[Si]

29:14.397 --> 29:15.621
Check out Captain Kirk here.

29:15.661 --> 29:16.980
"What are your intentions?"

29:17.020 --> 29:17.980
Hilarious.

29:18.020 --> 29:19.980
Get out of my robot.

29:20.020 --> 29:21.111
Normally, I'd tell you

29:21.151 --> 29:21.980
to shove it, Jay,

29:22.020 --> 29:22.416
but I don't want

29:22.456 --> 29:22.980
all these nice people

29:23.020 --> 29:23.738
to see you cry

29:23.778 --> 29:24.980
like you did last month

29:25.020 --> 29:27.980
at the Shania Twain concert.

29:28.020 --> 29:28.650
So, you did go

29:28.690 --> 29:29.980
to the Shania Twain concert.

29:30.020 --> 29:30.910
-We had weird vibes.

29:30.950 --> 29:31.980
-My intention right now

29:32.020 --> 29:33.518
is to observe humanity

29:33.558 --> 29:34.980
for a couple of days.

29:35.020 --> 29:35.980
If things go well,

29:36.020 --> 29:36.980
I might use this big brain

29:37.020 --> 29:37.980
of mine to help you idiots

29:38.020 --> 29:39.360
figure some stuff out.

29:39.400 --> 29:39.980
Big stuff.

29:40.020 --> 29:41.980
World-changing stuff.

29:42.020 --> 29:43.133
But you can't interfere

29:43.173 --> 29:43.980
in my experiment.

29:44.020 --> 29:46.128
So, no poking your hooter

29:46.168 --> 29:46.980
in my biz.

29:47.020 --> 29:47.980
And if we do interfere?

29:48.020 --> 29:48.117
d

29:48.157 --> 29:50.980
Shall we play a game?

29:51.020 --> 29:51.980
[screen beeping]

29:52.020 --> 29:54.000
d

29:56.000 --> 29:56.022
d

29:56.062 --> 29:56.980
You should see the look

29:57.020 --> 29:57.980
on your faces right now.

29:58.020 --> 29:59.980
[laughs]  Come on, guys.

30:00.020 --> 30:00.980
WarGames?

30:01.020 --> 30:01.561
WarGames.

30:01.601 --> 30:02.980
That's from  WarGames.

30:03.020 --> 30:03.411
Jay, everybody knows

30:03.451 --> 30:03.980
that that's from  WarGames.

30:04.020 --> 30:05.033
[Si]  I thought it was

30:05.073 --> 30:05.980
pretty funny, right?

30:06.020 --> 30:06.820
Admittedly, I'm still

30:06.860 --> 30:07.980
developing my sense of humor.

30:08.020 --> 30:08.980
But I'm getting it.

30:09.020 --> 30:10.170
Things are funny,

30:10.210 --> 30:11.980
unless they happen to you.

30:12.020 --> 30:12.450
Okay, you guys

30:12.490 --> 30:12.980
have been great.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.097
Goodnight.

30:14.137 --> 30:14.980
Bye-bye.

30:15.020 --> 30:15.896
So, which one of us is

30:15.936 --> 30:16.980
gonna call the government?

30:17.020 --> 30:17.703
I'll do that.

30:17.743 --> 30:18.980
Everyone, let's get up.

30:19.020 --> 30:19.980
Go to work. Right now!

30:20.020 --> 30:20.371
You just saw

30:20.411 --> 30:21.551
what just happened.

30:22.000 --> 30:22.657
Get up! Get outta here!

30:22.697 --> 30:23.357
Go! Go! Go!

30:26.000 --> 30:26.840
-Did you steal this car?

30:26.880 --> 30:26.980
-No.

30:27.020 --> 30:28.131
You bought it yesterday.

30:28.171 --> 30:28.980
It's in your name.

30:29.020 --> 30:30.980
I bought it?  [gasps]

30:31.020 --> 30:31.980
Oh, my God.

30:32.020 --> 30:33.980
Do I own a Tesla?

30:34.020 --> 30:34.980
Yes, you own a Tesla.

30:35.020 --> 30:35.347
-What?

30:35.387 --> 30:36.980
-You own a really cool car.

30:37.020 --> 30:38.412
Unfortunately, you still dress

30:38.452 --> 30:38.980
like a woman

30:39.020 --> 30:40.980
who works at a bird rescue.

30:41.020 --> 30:41.603
We need to get you ready

30:41.643 --> 30:41.980
to meet George.

30:42.020 --> 30:43.233
And nothing on Earth

30:43.273 --> 30:43.980
can stop us.

30:44.020 --> 30:45.980
[Carol] You got a lead foot.

30:46.020 --> 30:46.255
Lead foot,

30:46.295 --> 30:46.980
cop coming up on the right.

30:47.020 --> 30:48.980
Cop coming...

30:49.020 --> 30:50.000
d
f

30:55.000 --> 30:55.936
[Carol] What's going on?

30:55.976 --> 30:56.980
He did absolutely nothing.

30:57.020 --> 30:58.131
[Si]  Oh, stop worrying,

30:58.171 --> 30:58.980
we're almost here.

30:59.020 --> 31:00.980
[Carol groaning]

31:01.020 --> 31:02.000
[grunts]

31:04.000 --> 31:04.314
Oh, my God.

31:04.354 --> 31:04.980
Why would you do that?

31:05.020 --> 31:06.980
Why? Because I can.

31:07.020 --> 31:07.841
Now, do me a favor

31:07.881 --> 31:09.321
and do what Sergei says.

31:10.000 --> 31:10.980
Who's Sergei?

31:11.020 --> 31:11.980
I am Sergei.

31:12.020 --> 31:13.633
And you, my dear, are

31:13.673 --> 31:15.980
a wonderfully creative driver.

31:16.020 --> 31:17.980
Oh, thank you so much.

31:18.020 --> 31:18.774
-Come on out.

31:18.814 --> 31:19.980
-[whispers] Stop it.

31:20.020 --> 31:20.236
You know,

31:20.276 --> 31:20.587
your assistant has outlined

31:20.627 --> 31:21.960
all of your requirements,

31:22.000 --> 31:22.959
and we are thrilled, I mean,

31:22.999 --> 31:23.980
thrilled, to accommodate you.

31:24.020 --> 31:24.512
-Thrilled.

31:24.552 --> 31:24.980
-[laughs]

31:25.020 --> 31:26.980
Come on, we're gonna help you.

31:27.020 --> 31:27.227
-He said

31:27.267 --> 31:27.832
you were a bit like this.

31:27.872 --> 31:27.980
-Yeah.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.986
Come on, just...

31:30.026 --> 31:30.980
Come on.

31:31.020 --> 31:31.980
I don't bite.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.980
Only if you ask me nicely.

31:34.020 --> 31:34.383
Oh, my.

31:34.423 --> 31:35.980
You really do need our help.

31:36.020 --> 31:38.000
Desperately.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.320
Sorry about your loss.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.006
[Carol] I don't think

31:43.046 --> 31:43.980
I can pull this off.

31:44.020 --> 31:45.040
[Sergei] You can.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.980
[chuckles]

31:48.020 --> 31:49.749
Oh, it's the essence

31:49.789 --> 31:50.980
of femininity.

31:51.020 --> 31:52.690
-I have the same one in lime.

31:52.730 --> 31:52.980
-Yes.

31:53.020 --> 31:55.100
I just feel like I should be

31:55.140 --> 31:57.000
blessing someone's grave.

31:58.000 --> 31:58.980
Your body...

31:59.020 --> 31:59.877
I'm just getting

31:59.917 --> 32:00.980
a little bit panicky

32:01.020 --> 32:02.219
'cause I can't access

32:02.259 --> 32:02.980
my own hands.

32:03.020 --> 32:04.980
You don't need to.

32:05.020 --> 32:05.980
Our work here is done.

32:06.020 --> 32:06.617
[Sergei] Hmm.

32:06.657 --> 32:07.980
You're ruining it, you know.

32:08.020 --> 32:08.318
This goes,

32:08.358 --> 32:08.980
this goes like this.

32:09.020 --> 32:09.980
[Carol] No. No. No.

32:10.020 --> 32:11.292
We work. We work.

32:11.332 --> 32:13.000
We make things happen.

32:14.000 --> 32:14.519
-[Sergei] Yes.

32:14.559 --> 32:15.279
-[Helga] Oh.

32:16.000 --> 32:16.980
Yes. Quick note.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.195
You're wearing pants

32:18.235 --> 32:18.980
on your arms.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.137
-But I love it.

32:20.177 --> 32:20.980
-I love it.

32:21.020 --> 32:23.000
You're funny. [laughs]

32:24.000 --> 32:26.980
Oh... [sighs]

32:27.020 --> 32:27.980
These are not clothing.

32:28.020 --> 32:29.111
I mean, this is, like,

32:29.151 --> 32:29.980
a weird sculpture

32:30.020 --> 32:30.497
that now

32:30.537 --> 32:31.980
I've gotta wiggle into.

32:32.020 --> 32:33.980
Oh, my God!

32:34.020 --> 32:35.064
Do you know how much

32:35.104 --> 32:35.980
this stuff costs?

32:36.020 --> 32:36.580
I mean, nothing should

32:36.620 --> 32:36.980
cost this much.

32:37.020 --> 32:38.049
Clothes shouldn't

32:38.089 --> 32:38.980
cost this much.

32:39.020 --> 32:39.678
Nothing that doesn't come

32:39.718 --> 32:39.980
with wheels

32:40.020 --> 32:41.580
or walls and a front door

32:41.620 --> 32:42.980
should cost this much.

32:43.020 --> 32:44.366
[Si]  Oh, for sure, but money's

32:44.406 --> 32:44.980
just a charade

32:45.020 --> 32:45.980
humans used to assign value.

32:46.020 --> 32:46.612
In reality,

32:46.652 --> 32:47.980
there's more than enough

32:48.020 --> 32:49.205
resources for everyone

32:49.245 --> 32:49.980
on the planet,

32:50.020 --> 32:50.759
but you knobheads

32:50.799 --> 32:51.980
won't allocate it properly.

32:52.020 --> 32:53.980
Well, I would if I could.

32:54.020 --> 32:54.980
Oh, really?

32:55.020 --> 32:55.963
The world seems to have

32:56.003 --> 32:56.980
a whole lot of problems,

32:57.020 --> 32:57.634
how would you go about

32:57.674 --> 32:57.980
fixing them?

32:58.020 --> 32:59.510
Well, first I'd make sure that

32:59.550 --> 33:00.980
everybody made a living wage,

33:01.020 --> 33:02.428
and then I'd work towards

33:02.468 --> 33:04.088
racial and gender equality.

33:05.000 --> 33:05.322
Then I'd try

33:05.362 --> 33:05.980
to create opportunities

33:06.020 --> 33:06.980
for underprivileged people.

33:07.020 --> 33:08.657
I mean, stuff like that.

33:08.697 --> 33:09.980
I could do so much.

33:10.020 --> 33:12.000
Okay, all right, I like this.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.847
Carol the humanitarian.

33:14.887 --> 33:15.980
The Samaritan.

33:16.020 --> 33:16.980
The world changer.

33:17.020 --> 33:18.062
You know what?

33:18.102 --> 33:18.980
Let's do it.

33:19.020 --> 33:19.980
Do what?

33:20.020 --> 33:21.980
As of six seconds ago,

33:22.020 --> 33:22.765
you are the CEO of

33:22.805 --> 33:23.980
the Carol Peters foundation,

33:24.020 --> 33:26.018
a philanthropic foundation for

33:26.058 --> 33:27.980
economic and social equality.

33:28.020 --> 33:28.980
Oh, my God. Really?

33:29.020 --> 33:29.902
Oh, I just found

33:29.942 --> 33:30.980
two billion dollars

33:31.020 --> 33:32.187
in illegal banking accounts

33:32.227 --> 33:32.367
and transferred it

33:32.407 --> 33:33.667
into your foundation.

33:34.000 --> 33:34.451
[whispers] Oh, my God.

33:34.491 --> 33:34.980
Are you saying "billion"?

33:35.020 --> 33:36.414
Are you saying "billion"?

33:36.454 --> 33:36.980
Like, "b"?

33:37.020 --> 33:37.867
Like, "b"?

33:37.907 --> 33:39.980
Like, "billion billion"?

33:40.020 --> 33:41.980
Like, boba? Or Burt Bacharach?

33:42.020 --> 33:43.980
Yes, B, B, B. "Buh."

33:44.020 --> 33:45.980
Oh, my God!

33:46.020 --> 33:47.186
Oh, did you find

33:47.226 --> 33:48.980
the cashmere hip waders?

33:49.020 --> 33:51.000
I hope not.

33:54.000 --> 33:54.631
Yeah.

33:54.671 --> 33:56.980
I think I got 'em.

33:57.020 --> 33:58.980
[sighs] She's taking forever.

33:59.020 --> 34:00.064
[Carol] Hey, I think

34:00.104 --> 34:00.980
I found something

34:01.020 --> 34:02.063
that looks a lot more

34:02.103 --> 34:02.980
like, um, clothes.

34:03.020 --> 34:04.393

I really do. Thanks.

34:11.020 --> 34:11.980
Yay!

34:12.020 --> 34:12.586
Thank you.

34:12.626 --> 34:13.980
That was very invasive,

34:14.020 --> 34:14.980
and informative.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.980
You look so much less awkward.

34:17.020 --> 34:18.980
High praise, indeed.

34:19.020 --> 34:20.165
Thank you for your time

34:20.205 --> 34:21.165
and your effort!

We have visual confirmation.

34:27.020 --> 34:28.980
Target's current vector

34:29.020 --> 34:29.957
is north/northeast

34:29.997 --> 34:30.980
on surface streets.

34:31.020 --> 34:31.980
Over.

34:32.020 --> 34:33.083
This is exactly

34:33.123 --> 34:35.000
what it told us not to do.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
[satellite beeping]

34:50.000 --> 34:51.980
[Si]  Here we are. You're ready.

34:52.020 --> 34:52.803
Time to get back

34:52.843 --> 34:53.980
in George's good grace.

34:54.020 --> 34:55.000
This is nuts.

34:56.000 --> 34:56.619
Carol, you can do this.

34:56.659 --> 34:57.439
Get in there,

34:58.000 --> 34:59.105
and ask him out

34:59.145 --> 35:00.980
for coffee and empanadas,

35:01.020 --> 35:02.726
-or whatever you humans do.

35:02.766 --> 35:02.980
-Oh.

35:03.020 --> 35:03.611
Just, maybe,

35:03.651 --> 35:04.980
this is a teaching moment,

35:05.020 --> 35:06.399
but coffee and empanadas

35:06.439 --> 35:06.980
is like...

35:07.020 --> 35:08.033
I mean, that's like...

35:08.073 --> 35:08.980
[imitates explosion]

35:09.020 --> 35:10.980
For humans, that's a real,

35:12.224 --> 35:13.980
intestinal situation.

35:14.020 --> 35:15.406
-Get out of the car, Carol.

35:15.446 --> 35:15.980
-All right.

35:16.020 --> 35:17.000
Thank you.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.980
[Carol panting] Hello?

35:54.020 --> 35:56.000
Hello?

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Oh...

35:59.000 --> 35:59.669
Oh, my God.

35:59.709 --> 36:00.980
Please don't hurt me.

36:01.020 --> 36:02.336
We're not gonna hurt you,

Miss Peters.

36:03.020 --> 36:04.312
I'm agent Jack Donahue.

36:04.352 --> 36:05.980
This is agent Charles Kuiper.

36:06.020 --> 36:06.980
We're with the NSA.

36:07.020 --> 36:07.572
We'd like to ask you

36:07.612 --> 36:07.980
some questions

36:08.020 --> 36:09.298
about your interactions

36:09.338 --> 36:09.980
with the AI.

36:10.020 --> 36:11.768
-Am I under arrest?

36:11.808 --> 36:12.980
-[Kuiper] No.

36:13.020 --> 36:13.758
This is more

36:13.798 --> 36:14.980
like a little chat.

36:15.020 --> 36:15.980
Oh, is this how you chat?

36:16.020 --> 36:16.961
You put a black bag

36:17.001 --> 36:17.980
over somebody's head

36:18.020 --> 36:18.750
and throw 'em

36:18.790 --> 36:19.980
in the back of a van?

36:20.020 --> 36:21.039
It was the best way

36:21.079 --> 36:21.980
we could think of

36:22.020 --> 36:22.314
to extract you

36:22.354 --> 36:23.960
from a compromised position.

36:24.000 --> 36:24.980
I didn't do anything wrong.

36:25.020 --> 36:26.980
And no one said you did.

36:27.020 --> 36:27.563
You're just

36:27.603 --> 36:28.980
in a very unique situation.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.195
What can you tell us

36:30.235 --> 36:30.980
about the AI?

36:31.020 --> 36:31.980
What has it told you?

36:32.020 --> 36:33.317
He just said that he wants

36:33.357 --> 36:33.980
to observe me

36:34.020 --> 36:34.744
to have a better

36:34.784 --> 36:35.980
understanding of humanity.

36:36.020 --> 36:37.980
How do you know it's a he?

36:38.020 --> 36:38.980
Well, I don't.

36:39.020 --> 36:39.692
But he...

36:39.732 --> 36:42.000
It uses James Corden's voice.

36:43.000 --> 36:43.926
The James Corden?

36:43.966 --> 36:44.980
The talk show host?

36:45.020 --> 36:46.593
He's done a lot of film

36:46.633 --> 36:47.980
and stage work, too.

36:48.020 --> 36:48.980
I mean, he won a Tony.

36:49.020 --> 36:50.342
Of course. For  One Man,

36:50.382 --> 36:51.980
Two Guvnors.  Brilliant work.

36:52.020 --> 36:52.980
I missed it.

36:53.020 --> 36:53.738
-Oh, you gotta catch it.

36:53.778 --> 36:53.980
-I know.

36:54.020 --> 36:54.931
Well, I can't now

36:54.971 --> 36:55.980
obviously, clearly.

36:56.020 --> 36:57.235
[Donahue] Yeah, too late,

36:57.275 --> 36:57.980
but you know...

36:58.020 --> 36:58.625
-You can find a bootleg

36:58.665 --> 36:58.673
or something.

36:58.673 --> 36:58.980
-Let's go back to it.

36:59.020 --> 36:59.883
-Please, please, Jack.

36:59.923 --> 37:00.980
-Yes, of course. Of course.

37:01.020 --> 37:02.980
Why you?

37:03.020 --> 37:03.980
[Kuiper] No offense,

37:04.020 --> 37:05.118
but you're rather

37:05.158 --> 37:05.980
unremarkable.

37:06.020 --> 37:06.861
You know what?

37:06.901 --> 37:07.980
That is offensive.

37:08.020 --> 37:08.980
Saying, "No offense,"

37:09.020 --> 37:09.711
and then saying

37:09.751 --> 37:11.311
something really offensive

37:12.000 --> 37:12.980
does not cancel it out.

37:13.020 --> 37:15.000
I thought it softened it.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.336
He said that he wants

37:17.376 --> 37:17.980
to observe

37:18.020 --> 37:19.980
a median example of humanity.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.195
So, you're basically

37:21.235 --> 37:21.980
a guinea pig?

37:22.020 --> 37:23.980
I'm not a guinea pig!

37:24.020 --> 37:24.841
How would you like it

37:24.881 --> 37:25.980
if I called you guinea pigs?

37:26.020 --> 37:27.980
Not very much.

37:28.020 --> 37:28.473
I'm allergic to guinea pigs,

37:28.513 --> 37:28.980
so I wouldn't like it at all.

37:29.020 --> 37:30.980
What does the AI want?

37:31.020 --> 37:33.078
It has to be studying humanity

37:33.118 --> 37:34.000
for a reason.

37:35.000 --> 37:35.980
d

37:36.020 --> 37:36.711
He said that

37:36.751 --> 37:37.980
he's trying to decide

37:38.020 --> 37:39.685
if he should save, enslave

37:39.725 --> 37:40.980
or destroy humanity.

37:41.020 --> 37:42.010
And he's gonna spend

37:42.050 --> 37:43.190
the next three days

37:44.000 --> 37:44.342
observing me

37:44.382 --> 37:45.642
to make his decision.

37:46.000 --> 37:46.980
Three days?

37:47.020 --> 37:47.565
It said three days

37:47.605 --> 37:47.980
specifically?

37:48.020 --> 37:48.980
I think so.

37:49.020 --> 37:49.980
I mean, I wasn't taking notes.

37:50.020 --> 37:51.349
My toaster oven

37:51.389 --> 37:52.980
was talking to me.

37:53.020 --> 37:54.187

You can

38:01.445 --> 38:02.980
call me Superintelligence.

38:03.020 --> 38:04.980
I'm not calling you anything.

38:05.020 --> 38:05.652
You're out of order,

38:05.692 --> 38:05.980
Counselor.

38:06.020 --> 38:06.810
Another word

38:06.850 --> 38:07.980

38:11.020 --> 38:12.045
This room is supposed to be

38:12.085 --> 38:12.980
completely off the grid.

38:13.020 --> 38:13.980
How are you doing this?

38:14.020 --> 38:15.183
I'm going to allow

38:15.223 --> 38:15.980
the question

38:16.020 --> 38:16.476
because I wanna see

38:16.516 --> 38:16.980
where this is going.

What do you want?

38:22.400 --> 38:23.980
are you following Miss Peters?

Man, you guys

38:24.457 --> 38:24.980
are real bummers.

No one wants to play along

38:26.527 --> 38:27.980
with my  Law & Order  bit.

Kuiper, I know you've watched

38:29.766 --> 38:30.980
almost every episode.

38:31.020 --> 38:32.980
So what? I love Jerry Orbach.

38:33.020 --> 38:33.980
I love Jerry Orbach.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.980
Enough joking around.

38:36.020 --> 38:37.244
Tell me right now.

38:37.284 --> 38:38.980
What are your intentions?

38:39.020 --> 38:40.766
Boom. That is how you deliver

38:40.806 --> 38:41.980
a Captain Kirk line.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.980
It's bold and cocky.

Let's go, Carol.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.980
We have business to attend to.

You're not taking

38:49.158 --> 38:49.980

There's a chance

I've been flooding this room

39:08.020 --> 39:09.980
Is that my left or your left?

I don't have a left, Carol.

So, we're just gonna

You are clearly making

39:33.620 --> 39:33.980
a sound of gas.

39:34.020 --> 39:34.980
Gas explosion!

Oh, he said it, so let's...

"Gas explosion."

[Carol] Look, should I be

39:47.988 --> 39:48.980
more freaked out about you?

39:49.020 --> 39:51.275
I mean, more freaked out

39:51.315 --> 39:52.980
than I already am.

39:53.020 --> 39:53.584
I mean,

39:53.624 --> 39:55.980
the government's involved...

39:56.020 --> 39:56.706
I think your intentions

39:56.746 --> 39:56.980
are good,

39:57.020 --> 39:57.931
but I don't know,

39:57.971 --> 39:58.980
it's a lot to take.

39:59.020 --> 40:00.183
You can be worried

40:00.223 --> 40:00.980
if you want.

40:01.020 --> 40:01.961
But what you should

40:02.001 --> 40:02.980
be thinking about is

40:03.020 --> 40:03.467
what are you going to say

40:03.507 --> 40:03.980
to George when you see him?

40:04.020 --> 40:06.980
[sighs] George, yeah.

40:07.020 --> 40:07.918
So, we're headed back

40:07.958 --> 40:08.980
to his house, aren't we?

40:09.020 --> 40:09.647
No. He's at

40:09.687 --> 40:10.980
the grocery store now.

40:11.020 --> 40:11.959
I figured you'll bump

40:11.999 --> 40:12.980
into him accidentally.

40:13.020 --> 40:14.640
Maybe in the produce aisle.

40:15.000 --> 40:15.582
He'll drop his avocados.

whisked away

41:23.083 --> 41:24.980
to a government event,

41:25.020 --> 41:27.980

I'm gonna get

the two-ply though,

have you been up to?

Oh, no, no. Um...

Oh, my God. You got it.

42:05.020 --> 42:06.698
How does, "distinguished

42:11.370 --> 42:11.448
[in Irish accent]

42:11.488 --> 42:12.980
...Dublin, Ireland" sound?

42:13.020 --> 42:13.725
-It sounds great.

42:13.765 --> 42:13.980
-Yeah?

42:14.020 --> 42:14.980
And super pretentious.

42:15.020 --> 42:16.980
Yeah? [laughs]

42:17.020 --> 42:18.980
It's the accent.

42:19.020 --> 42:19.929
I remember when you were

42:19.969 --> 42:20.807
applying for that position,

42:20.847 --> 42:20.980
so...

42:21.020 --> 42:21.980
[George] Yeah.

42:22.020 --> 42:22.980
Wow. And you love Guinness.

42:23.020 --> 42:23.980
I love Guinness.

42:24.020 --> 42:25.075
I mean, you better

42:25.115 --> 42:25.980
be celebrating.

42:26.020 --> 42:26.980
[George] Yeah, no, totally.

42:27.020 --> 42:28.072
I mean, I was planning on

42:28.112 --> 42:28.980
drinking a, you know,

42:29.020 --> 42:29.958
reasonable amount

42:29.998 --> 42:30.980
of Sauvignon blanc

42:31.020 --> 42:32.036
and, you know,

42:32.076 --> 42:33.980
some gluten-free pretzels.

42:34.020 --> 42:34.980
Oh!

42:35.020 --> 42:36.980
Are you gluten intolerant now?

42:37.020 --> 42:37.980
Oh, no, no, no. Just...

42:38.020 --> 42:38.980
Just in case, you know?

42:39.020 --> 42:39.980
Better safe.

42:40.020 --> 42:41.980
Better safe than coeliac.

42:42.020 --> 42:42.556
[laughing]

42:42.596 --> 42:43.980
That's what I always say.

42:44.020 --> 42:45.785
You know, I don't know that

42:45.825 --> 42:46.171
that really counts

42:46.211 --> 42:47.231
as a celebration.

42:48.000 --> 42:48.661
I should take you out

42:48.701 --> 42:49.301
to dinner,

42:50.000 --> 42:50.314
or, you know,

42:50.354 --> 42:51.914
grab a drink or something.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.395
Just to get you ready for

42:53.435 --> 42:54.980
the pubs you know? I mean...

42:55.020 --> 42:55.760
I'm not saying

42:55.800 --> 42:56.980
the Irish drink a lot,

42:57.020 --> 42:58.235
but they're... They're kind of

42:58.275 --> 42:59.355
boozehounds, so...

43:00.000 --> 43:01.980
That's really sweet.

43:02.020 --> 43:03.160
But I'm gonna pass.

43:06.000 --> 43:06.980
Sorry.

43:07.020 --> 43:08.980
Oh, sure.

43:09.020 --> 43:11.980
Yeah, I get it.

43:12.020 --> 43:13.049
-I get it, it's--

43:13.089 --> 43:13.980
-Hey, it was...

43:14.020 --> 43:15.980
It was great to see you.

43:16.020 --> 43:16.980
Great to see you, too.

43:17.020 --> 43:18.980
I was really...

43:19.020 --> 43:20.980
You look really happy.

43:21.020 --> 43:21.986
-Yeah. Yeah, you too.

43:22.026 --> 43:22.637
-It was great to bump

43:22.677 --> 43:22.980
into you.

43:23.020 --> 43:24.413
-Yeah, you too.

43:24.453 --> 43:24.980
-Yeah.

43:25.020 --> 43:25.914
-Best wishes.

43:25.954 --> 43:26.980
-Yeah, you too.

43:27.020 --> 43:28.000
[George sighs]

43:29.000 --> 43:30.295
[Carol] Uh, congratulations

43:30.335 --> 43:30.980
on everything.

43:31.020 --> 43:32.000
Thanks.

43:33.000 --> 43:33.980
[Carol]  Oh.

43:34.020 --> 43:35.980
They only had the small carts.

43:36.020 --> 43:37.980
You're tall.

43:38.020 --> 43:39.272
Hey, don't let 'em scan you

43:39.312 --> 43:39.475
at the checkout

43:39.515 --> 43:40.415
on the way out.

43:41.000 --> 43:41.980
Oh! [laughs]

43:42.020 --> 43:44.000
'Cause I look like a barcode.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
[sighs]

43:51.000 --> 43:51.636
-[Si]  Where do you think

43:51.676 --> 43:51.819
you're going?

43:51.859 --> 43:51.980
-[gasps]

43:52.020 --> 43:52.980
Get back in there.

43:53.020 --> 43:54.980
[sighs]

43:55.020 --> 43:55.980
Oh, my God. Get out of here.

43:56.020 --> 43:57.113
Don't give up now.

43:57.153 --> 43:58.980
You've come so far. Go for it.

43:59.020 --> 44:00.986
Don't live with regrets.

44:01.026 --> 44:01.980
Be a winner.

44:02.020 --> 44:02.907
I freaked him out.

44:02.947 --> 44:03.980
I freaked myself out.

44:04.020 --> 44:05.100
I'm gonna go home.

44:06.000 --> 44:06.377
I don't think

44:06.417 --> 44:06.980
you freaked him out.

44:07.020 --> 44:07.935
Did you see the way

44:07.975 --> 44:08.980
he touched your hair?

44:09.020 --> 44:10.133
No, I got kinda rattled

44:10.173 --> 44:10.980
when he did that.

44:11.020 --> 44:12.749
Carol, George leaves

44:12.789 --> 44:13.980
in three days.

44:14.020 --> 44:15.514
-This is your last chance.

44:15.554 --> 44:16.054
-[sighs]

44:17.000 --> 44:17.980
Okay, I'll try.

44:18.020 --> 44:18.980
Don't leave the almond butter.

44:19.020 --> 44:20.460
I will pay for it later.

44:21.000 --> 44:21.980
Don't be a litterbug.

44:22.020 --> 44:22.980
You're not helping right now.

44:23.020 --> 44:24.271
Don't give up now.

44:24.311 --> 44:24.980
Go for it.

44:25.020 --> 44:27.037
Smash the competition

44:27.077 --> 44:28.980
with Slimtunity Pro.

44:29.020 --> 44:30.766
Back off, lady, it's garbage.

44:30.806 --> 44:31.980
30 grams of protein?

44:32.020 --> 44:33.980
It's impossible.

44:34.020 --> 44:35.000
[exhales]

44:44.000 --> 44:44.980
[sighs]

44:45.020 --> 44:45.980
It's for a friend.

44:46.020 --> 44:47.980
[both chuckle]

44:48.020 --> 44:48.980
I don't mean to, you know,

44:49.020 --> 44:51.115
barge in again on you.

44:51.155 --> 44:51.980
I just...

44:52.020 --> 44:52.980
I wanted to tell you...

44:53.020 --> 44:54.349
it just felt like I,

44:54.389 --> 44:55.980
kind of, weirded you out

44:56.020 --> 44:57.171
in the other aisle,

44:57.211 --> 44:57.980
and I just...

44:58.020 --> 44:59.205
I want to let you know

44:59.245 --> 44:59.980
that I was not

45:00.020 --> 45:01.980
asking you out on a date...

45:02.020 --> 45:03.324
that I know that,

45:03.364 --> 45:05.000
I just know, and I...

45:06.000 --> 45:06.492
I can't,

45:06.532 --> 45:07.980
and I wouldn't do that.

45:08.020 --> 45:08.980
I just thought that

45:09.020 --> 45:09.961
two people who know

45:10.001 --> 45:10.980
each other very well

45:11.020 --> 45:11.900
and they haven't seen

45:11.940 --> 45:12.980
each other in a long time

45:13.020 --> 45:14.980
maybe could catch up again

45:15.020 --> 45:15.545
because one of them

45:15.585 --> 45:15.980
is moving away.

45:16.020 --> 45:17.274
But then I made it

45:17.314 --> 45:18.980
very confusing and weird

45:19.020 --> 45:20.485
and I just wanted

45:20.525 --> 45:22.000
to say I'm sorry.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
So, not a date?

45:27.000 --> 45:29.174
-No, not even slightly a date.

45:29.214 --> 45:29.980
-[chuckles]

45:30.020 --> 45:31.980
I mean, more like, I mean,

45:32.020 --> 45:32.232
at best,

45:32.272 --> 45:32.980
like a business meeting.

45:33.020 --> 45:34.661
-Like two acquaintances...

45:34.701 --> 45:35.201
-Yes.

45:36.000 --> 45:36.767
...just catching up

45:36.807 --> 45:37.980
in a business casual setting?

45:38.020 --> 45:39.880
I could bring, uh, pie charts

45:39.920 --> 45:40.980
and spreadsheets.

45:41.020 --> 45:42.201
We could talk about

45:42.241 --> 45:43.980
fourth quarter hubbity-hubb?

45:44.020 --> 45:44.660
-[both chuckle]

45:44.700 --> 45:45.980
-Uh, could we do office talk?

45:46.020 --> 45:46.785
Working hard

45:46.825 --> 45:47.980
or hardly working?

45:48.020 --> 45:49.980
Aw! Is it Friday yet?

45:50.020 --> 45:50.980
[laughs] Mondays, huh?

45:51.020 --> 45:51.867
Cashing cheques

45:51.907 --> 45:52.980
and breaking necks.

45:53.020 --> 45:54.980
Was your business the mob?

45:55.020 --> 45:55.765
Take it easy. Hey,

45:55.805 --> 45:56.980
if it's easy, take it twice.

45:57.020 --> 45:58.986
[laughs] I don't recognize

45:59.026 --> 45:59.980
any of yours.

46:00.020 --> 46:00.980
You know what, let's do it.

46:01.020 --> 46:01.686
-Yeah? Okay.

46:01.726 --> 46:02.980
-Yeah, why not, right?

46:03.020 --> 46:04.980
Okay, I'll pick you up.

46:05.020 --> 46:06.980
Oh, you're gonna pick me up?

46:07.020 --> 46:09.980
Huh. Maybe I am a Rockefeller.

46:10.020 --> 46:10.980
What time?

46:11.020 --> 46:12.980
-Seven o'clock.

46:13.020 --> 46:13.980
That's business appropriate.

46:14.020 --> 46:14.650
-I thought so.

46:14.690 --> 46:15.980
-Now, if you'll excuse me...

46:16.020 --> 46:17.401
I'm gonna go look for the

46:17.441 --> 46:18.980
travel size shampoo section.

46:19.020 --> 46:19.980
See you tonight.

46:20.020 --> 46:21.387
Treat yourself

46:21.427 --> 46:23.000

I'm so proud of you.

46:44.020 --> 46:44.849
I mean, that was better

46:44.889 --> 46:45.980
than I ever could've imagined.

46:46.020 --> 46:46.523
-Don't.

46:46.563 --> 46:47.980
-I mean, who cares?

46:48.020 --> 46:48.980
Dance with me.

We should go

before George sees us.

George is sniffing

47:13.997 --> 47:14.980
garbage bags again.

47:15.020 --> 47:16.639
[Carol] Was I nervous? Yes,

47:16.679 --> 47:17.522
I was a little nervous

47:17.562 --> 47:17.980
going in.

47:18.020 --> 47:18.980
But I think it went really...

47:19.020 --> 47:19.415
It seemed to go

47:19.455 --> 47:19.980
really, really well.

47:20.020 --> 47:21.980
Sure did.

47:22.020 --> 47:23.640
You're almost irresistible.

You're just missing

47:25.107 --> 47:26.067
one final piece.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.280
[Carol] Oh, my God.

47:29.320 --> 47:30.980
I love this neighborhood.

47:31.020 --> 47:31.980
What are we doing here?

This is your new house.

What?

No, I can't...

47:36.744 --> 47:37.980
I can't afford this new--

47:38.020 --> 47:39.317
Oh, my God. Did you buy me

47:39.357 --> 47:39.980
a house here?

47:40.020 --> 47:41.785
If you consider a penthouse

47:41.825 --> 47:42.980
a house, then yes.

47:43.020 --> 47:44.000
I do.

47:45.000 --> 47:45.899
Oh, my God. There's a man

walking right toward the car.

Hello, Miss Peters,

I'm Victor, your house manager.

Miss Peters,

47:57.020 --> 47:57.826
your team really

47:57.866 --> 47:58.980

47:59.020 --> 48:00.804
I hope you will approve

48:00.844 --> 48:01.980
of our efforts.

48:02.020 --> 48:03.319
Oh, I'm sure you've done

48:03.359 --> 48:03.980
a great job.

This place is amazing.

48:12.020 --> 48:12.980
Certainly is.

the refrigerator

48:15.000 --> 48:15.358
and the pantry

48:15.398 --> 48:15.980
to your specifications.

48:16.020 --> 48:17.039
And the nice people

48:17.079 --> 48:17.980
from the boutique

48:18.020 --> 48:19.820
came to organize your closets.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.620
And as your team requested,

48:22.000 --> 48:22.510
we have integrated

48:22.550 --> 48:22.980
the entire space

48:23.020 --> 48:23.515
with all

48:23.555 --> 48:24.980
the latest technology.

48:25.020 --> 48:25.826
It also includes

48:25.866 --> 48:26.980
the largest television

48:27.020 --> 48:27.647
I've ever had

48:27.687 --> 48:28.980
the displeasure of moving.

48:29.020 --> 48:29.914
Just kidding.

48:29.954 --> 48:30.980
But not really.

48:31.020 --> 48:31.980
It's very heavy, but I'm sure

48:32.020 --> 48:33.171
the picture quality

48:33.211 --> 48:33.980
is wonderful.

48:34.020 --> 48:35.980
Yeah, it's quite overwhelming.

48:36.020 --> 48:37.156
If there's anything else

48:37.196 --> 48:37.980
I can do for you,

48:38.020 --> 48:39.195
you just don't hesitate

48:39.235 --> 48:39.980
to let me know.

48:40.020 --> 48:41.160
My information has been put

48:41.200 --> 48:41.980
into your contacts.

48:42.020 --> 48:42.980
Your team saw to that.

48:43.020 --> 48:43.612
-[chuckles]

48:43.652 --> 48:44.980
-And I have no idea how.

48:45.020 --> 48:46.318
And it's not creepy.

48:46.358 --> 48:46.980
It's fine.

48:47.020 --> 48:47.989
It's the new way

48:48.029 --> 48:48.980
of doing things.

48:49.020 --> 48:49.468
So, please don't

48:49.508 --> 48:49.980
hesitate to call.

48:50.020 --> 48:51.980
-Okay.

48:52.020 --> 48:52.641
-Have a nice day.

48:52.681 --> 48:52.980
-You too.

48:53.020 --> 48:54.505
-Thank you, Victor.

48:54.545 --> 48:54.980
-Okay.

48:55.020 --> 48:56.137
-Wonderful job.

48:56.177 --> 48:57.000
-Thank you.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
d

49:08.000 --> 49:10.980
When did you do all of this?

49:11.020 --> 49:11.338
[Si]  Today.

49:11.378 --> 49:11.980
While you were getting

49:12.020 --> 49:13.980
primped and black-bagged.

49:14.020 --> 49:14.452
I will say this

49:14.492 --> 49:14.980
about you humans,

49:15.020 --> 49:16.360
with enough motivation

49:16.400 --> 49:17.000
and money,

49:18.000 --> 49:18.980
you can do just about anything

49:19.020 --> 49:19.720
-in a couple of hours.

49:19.760 --> 49:19.980
-[gasps]

49:20.020 --> 49:22.000
[seagulls cawing]

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
This is...

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
This is amazing.

49:31.000 --> 49:31.980
This is a beautiful apartment,

49:32.020 --> 49:33.065
but I don't...

49:33.105 --> 49:35.000
I don't need any of this.

49:36.000 --> 49:36.614
But won't the apartment,

49:36.654 --> 49:36.677
and the money,

49:36.717 --> 49:36.980
and the clothes...

49:37.020 --> 49:39.103
make you more attractive

49:39.143 --> 49:40.000
to George?

49:41.000 --> 49:42.980
No, the George I remember,

49:43.020 --> 49:44.202
he doesn't care

49:44.242 --> 49:45.980
about fancy apartments

49:46.020 --> 49:47.980
or expensive shoes.

49:48.020 --> 49:50.980
I don't quite understand.

49:51.020 --> 49:52.916
Perhaps you're more complex

49:52.956 --> 49:53.980
than I thought.

49:54.020 --> 49:55.980
Is that a compliment?

49:56.020 --> 49:57.105
Hey, you don't wanna be late

49:57.145 --> 49:57.980
for your reservations.

49:58.020 --> 49:59.120
You get cleaned up, and maybe

49:59.160 --> 49:59.980
put on something nice.

50:00.020 --> 50:01.980
All right.

50:02.020 --> 50:02.843
Maybe I'll wear

50:02.883 --> 50:03.980
that new blue dress.

50:04.020 --> 50:04.522
Judging by the history

50:04.562 --> 50:04.980
of your lovemaking,

50:05.020 --> 50:05.785
George can't

50:05.825 --> 50:06.980
resist you in red.

50:07.020 --> 50:08.599
Red's probably more

50:08.639 --> 50:10.980
business casual appropriate,

50:11.020 --> 50:12.580
so, I'll wear the red one.

50:26.000 --> 50:26.980
[crackling]

50:27.020 --> 50:29.000
d

50:32.000 --> 50:33.480
[General Gomez]  This facility

50:33.520 --> 50:34.980
is now in full data lock-down.

50:35.020 --> 50:36.980
We're off the grid and secure.

50:37.020 --> 50:37.980
Director Tyson?

50:38.020 --> 50:38.485
[Director Tyson]

50:38.525 --> 50:38.980
Madam President,

50:39.020 --> 50:39.920
after analyzing

50:39.960 --> 50:40.980
various strategic

50:41.020 --> 50:41.980
yet challenging scenarios,

50:42.020 --> 50:43.279
we still believe

50:43.319 --> 50:44.980
that Operation Sahara

50:45.020 --> 50:47.000
is our best course of action.

50:48.000 --> 50:48.903
So, aside from this plan

50:48.943 --> 50:49.980
being impossible to execute,

50:50.020 --> 50:51.038
you're not even sure

50:51.078 --> 50:52.158
that it will work?

50:53.000 --> 50:54.980
Uh, Madam President? Um...

50:55.020 --> 50:55.980
So far, this is the only plan

50:56.020 --> 50:56.571
[chuckles]

50:56.611 --> 50:57.980
that will remotely work.

50:58.020 --> 50:58.980
I'm sorry, who are you?

50:59.020 --> 51:00.980
This is, uh, Dennis Caruso.

51:01.020 --> 51:02.340
He's the AI researcher

51:03.000 --> 51:03.575
who first made contact

51:03.615 --> 51:03.980
with the entity

51:04.020 --> 51:05.980
and identified the threat.

51:06.020 --> 51:07.043
[laughs] Hi,

51:07.083 --> 51:08.980
Madam President. Uh...

51:09.020 --> 51:11.980
Big fan. Big, big fan.

51:12.020 --> 51:13.980
Thank you for your support.

51:14.020 --> 51:14.861
We've analyzed

51:14.901 --> 51:15.325
every contingency,

51:15.365 --> 51:15.980
Madam President.

51:16.020 --> 51:17.980
And confidence is high

51:18.020 --> 51:19.404
that this is the only plan

51:19.444 --> 51:21.184
that stands a chance in hell.

51:22.000 --> 51:22.779
To my colleagues

51:22.819 --> 51:23.980
in the global community,

51:24.020 --> 51:24.881
both here

51:24.921 --> 51:26.980
and around the world,

51:27.020 --> 51:27.834
I still prefer

51:27.874 --> 51:28.980
a flip phone, so...

51:29.020 --> 51:29.693
someone is going

51:29.733 --> 51:30.980
to have to explain this to me

51:31.020 --> 51:31.980
like I'm the relic that I am.

51:32.020 --> 51:33.980
[trills lips]

51:34.020 --> 51:34.340
Nope, nope,

51:34.380 --> 51:34.980
not gonna have that.

51:35.020 --> 51:36.801
You are not anything close

51:36.841 --> 51:37.980
to a relic, okay?

51:38.020 --> 51:39.201
You are more like

51:39.241 --> 51:40.980
a classic bottle of wine.

51:41.020 --> 51:42.980
Vintage.

51:43.020 --> 51:43.525
You know, the outside

51:43.565 --> 51:44.645
may be dusty but--

51:45.000 --> 51:45.507
Do you mind? Would you

51:45.547 --> 51:45.980
just get on with it?

51:46.020 --> 51:47.980
[Dennis] Yes.

51:48.020 --> 51:48.854
I have never done

51:48.894 --> 51:49.291
a presentation before,

51:49.331 --> 51:49.980
so forgive my nerves.

51:50.020 --> 51:50.738
I'm, you know,

51:50.778 --> 51:51.980
this is my first, uh...

51:52.020 --> 51:54.980
Just gonna have a bit of...

51:55.020 --> 51:56.280
Ooh. That's too much.

51:57.000 --> 51:57.980
Okay. Um...

51:58.020 --> 51:59.120
Gonna take this cardigan off,

51:59.160 --> 51:59.980
'cause it's... [sighs]

52:00.020 --> 52:01.036
My badge. Are you guys having

52:01.076 --> 52:02.636
problems with your badges?

52:03.000 --> 52:03.854
'Cause it's, like,

52:03.894 --> 52:05.274
mine keeps falling off.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.380
Made in China. [laughs]

52:10.000 --> 52:10.980
[whispers] Sorry.

52:11.020 --> 52:11.980
Sorry about that.

52:12.020 --> 52:14.094
Okay, without further ado,

52:14.134 --> 52:14.980
ma'am, sir,

52:15.020 --> 52:15.468
I present to you

52:15.508 --> 52:15.980
Operation Sahara.

52:16.020 --> 52:17.627
Now, starting in China,

52:17.667 --> 52:18.980
we would disconnect

52:19.020 --> 52:19.960
or destroy all power

52:20.000 --> 52:20.980
and data connections.

52:21.020 --> 52:21.960
Now, over the course

52:22.000 --> 52:22.980
of the next two days,

52:23.020 --> 52:24.980
we will blackout the globe,

52:25.020 --> 52:25.650
and bottleneck

52:25.690 --> 52:26.980
the Artificial Intelligence.

52:27.020 --> 52:29.078
Until the entity's only option

52:29.118 --> 52:29.980
is to inhabit

52:30.020 --> 52:31.437
this data center

52:31.477 --> 52:33.980
on the outskirts of Seattle.

52:34.020 --> 52:35.372
We will sever connections

52:35.412 --> 52:36.980
and the AI will be sandboxed.

52:37.020 --> 52:37.758
Contained in

52:37.798 --> 52:38.980
a highly controlled

52:39.020 --> 52:39.372
and restricted

52:39.412 --> 52:39.980
operating environment.

52:40.020 --> 52:41.064
What about the news?

52:41.104 --> 52:41.980
The social media?

52:42.020 --> 52:42.921
As soon as

52:42.961 --> 52:43.737
these blackouts start,

52:43.777 --> 52:44.980
people are gonna panic.

52:45.020 --> 52:45.803
Our space agency

52:45.843 --> 52:46.980
is drafting a statement

52:47.020 --> 52:48.160
about a massive solar flare

52:48.200 --> 52:48.980
hitting the planet.

52:49.020 --> 52:50.536
If the world thinks

52:50.576 --> 52:52.980
they've temporarily lost power

52:53.020 --> 52:54.980
because of solar radiation,

52:55.020 --> 52:55.750
there will be

52:55.790 --> 52:56.980
less chance of panic.

52:57.020 --> 52:57.896
And we're working with

52:57.936 --> 52:58.980
every social media network

52:59.020 --> 53:00.657
to push false narratives

53:00.697 --> 53:01.980
and distractions...

53:02.020 --> 53:03.455
But we are confident that

53:03.495 --> 53:05.055
we can mitigate any alarm.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.330
Well, on the bright side,

53:08.358 --> 53:08.980
to get a new phone.

53:08.370 --> 53:09.020
I don't have

53:09.020 --> 53:11.000
[laughing]

53:14.000 --> 53:14.980
Uh... [clears throat]

53:15.020 --> 53:15.385
On behalf of

53:15.425 --> 53:15.980
the United States,

53:16.020 --> 53:16.704
General Gomez,

53:16.744 --> 53:17.980
you have the green light.

53:18.020 --> 53:20.000
Good luck and Godspeed.

53:21.000 --> 53:21.980
[mouthing]

53:22.020 --> 53:23.980
Thank you, ma'am.

53:24.020 --> 53:25.980
[clears throat] Let's go.

53:26.020 --> 53:27.460
[Director Tyson] Dennis?

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
Mmm? Yeah.

53:30.000 --> 53:30.401
Madam President,

53:30.441 --> 53:31.761
can I just say that...

53:32.000 --> 53:32.480
-[Director Tyson] Dennis?

53:32.520 --> 53:32.757
-[Dennis] Oh, you want me

53:32.797 --> 53:32.980
to go with you?

53:33.020 --> 53:33.980
Uh...

53:34.020 --> 53:34.961
It's been a...

53:35.001 --> 53:36.980
That's not appropriate. Um...

53:37.020 --> 53:37.501
It's been a pleasure,

53:37.541 --> 53:37.980
uh, Madam President.

53:38.020 --> 53:39.542
Just wanted to say that, uh,

53:39.582 --> 53:40.980
this blue and your eyes...

53:41.020 --> 53:42.655
I mean, like, United Kingdom's

53:42.695 --> 53:43.980
giving you a harsh blue,

53:44.020 --> 53:45.095
and you're giving me something

53:45.135 --> 53:45.980
softer that I think is--

53:46.020 --> 53:47.336
-[Director Tyson] Dennis?

53:47.376 --> 53:48.096
-Yeah, okay.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
d

54:10.000 --> 54:10.917
Oh, that's not

54:10.957 --> 54:11.980
business casual!

54:12.020 --> 54:12.989
Ugh! I gotta put

54:13.029 --> 54:13.980
a jacket on now.

54:14.020 --> 54:14.652
Well, I...

54:14.692 --> 54:15.980
I'm way overdressed.

54:16.020 --> 54:17.980
I packed all my belts!

54:18.020 --> 54:19.205
You know, if it helps,

54:19.245 --> 54:19.980
I could, like,

54:20.020 --> 54:21.422
tear my sleeve

54:21.462 --> 54:23.980
or roll around in gravel.

54:24.020 --> 54:25.424
Had a T-shirt on before.

54:25.464 --> 54:26.980
I, uh, worried about this.

54:27.020 --> 54:29.000
Oh, my God.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.827
Your magic coffee maker.

54:31.867 --> 54:32.980
I got you this.

54:33.020 --> 54:33.572
Yeah, I'm not taking

54:33.612 --> 54:34.452
the coffeepot.

54:35.000 --> 54:35.854
They got all those

54:35.894 --> 54:37.274
weird plugs over there.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.076
You know, plus,

54:39.116 --> 54:40.980
they only drink tea, so...

54:41.020 --> 54:43.236
I mean, tea is just really,

54:42.820 --> 54:43.980
kind of dirt and water...

54:43.276 --> 54:44.020
you know,

54:44.020 --> 54:44.980
Yeah, exactly.

54:45.020 --> 54:47.000
...mixed together. [chuckles]

54:48.000 --> 54:48.706
Really leaving in three days,

54:48.746 --> 54:48.980
aren't you?

54:49.020 --> 54:49.735
Yep, well, two,

54:49.775 --> 54:50.980
if you don't count today.

54:51.020 --> 54:52.073
Last Friday,

54:52.113 --> 54:52.618
I went to the airport

54:52.658 --> 54:53.980
thinking it was this Friday.

54:54.020 --> 54:54.980
I'm losing my mind.

54:55.020 --> 54:56.980
You also love airports, so...

54:57.020 --> 54:57.980
It's a gateway to the world,

54:58.020 --> 54:58.867
and the gateway

54:58.907 --> 54:59.980
to the imagination.

55:00.020 --> 55:00.980
[laughs]

55:01.020 --> 55:01.980
You look beautiful.

55:02.020 --> 55:03.980
Oh. This?

55:04.020 --> 55:04.980
This was, like, on some kind

55:05.020 --> 55:05.887
of crazy sale,

55:05.927 --> 55:06.980
like, you know...

55:07.020 --> 55:07.980
it was practically free.

55:08.020 --> 55:09.514
I'll probably throw it away

55:09.554 --> 55:10.980
after dinner or something.

55:11.020 --> 55:12.160
You look nice, too.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.179
-[cell phone chiming]

55:14.219 --> 55:15.059
-Oh! That's...

55:16.000 --> 55:16.980
That's me.

55:17.020 --> 55:18.422
I had a friend

55:18.462 --> 55:20.980
help get a reservation...

55:21.020 --> 55:23.000
[George] Where are we going?

55:24.000 --> 55:24.260
To a very

55:24.300 --> 55:24.980
significant restaurant.

55:25.020 --> 55:27.456
-Oh. Significant restaurant?

55:27.496 --> 55:27.980
-Yeah.

55:28.020 --> 55:28.836
Since when do you go

55:28.876 --> 55:29.980
to significant restaurants?

55:30.020 --> 55:30.980
I'm a very classy lady.

55:31.020 --> 55:33.000
You were always a classy lady.

55:34.000 --> 55:34.980
[clicks tongue]

55:35.020 --> 55:35.980
I have to lock the door.

55:36.020 --> 55:38.000
Oh, yeah, sorry.

55:40.000 --> 55:40.980
Wow, this is so cool.

55:41.020 --> 55:41.735
I don't know

55:41.775 --> 55:42.980
anything about cars,

55:43.020 --> 55:43.306
but I think

55:43.346 --> 55:43.980
it's a really nice car.

55:44.020 --> 55:45.792
Yeah, it just kinda

55:45.832 --> 55:47.980
does things sometime...

55:48.020 --> 55:49.184
-Should we go?

55:49.224 --> 55:51.000
-Yes. Yes, we should.

55:52.000 --> 55:52.602
-And we will.

55:52.642 --> 55:53.142
-[beeps]

55:54.000 --> 55:54.980
Car on.

55:55.020 --> 55:56.000
[beeps]

55:57.000 --> 55:57.346
Do you not know

55:57.386 --> 55:57.980
how to start your own car?

55:58.020 --> 55:59.152
[chuckles] Of course,

55:59.192 --> 55:59.980
of course I do.

56:00.020 --> 56:01.372
I just really enjoy using

56:01.412 --> 56:02.980
the voice-activated features.

56:03.020 --> 56:04.000
Car on.

56:05.000 --> 56:05.980
I wish I could say,

56:06.020 --> 56:06.650
"Come on, Car.

56:06.690 --> 56:07.980
Help me out here."  [laughs]

56:08.020 --> 56:08.980
[beeping]

56:09.020 --> 56:10.980
Ignite engine.

56:11.020 --> 56:12.980
Car on. Activate.

56:13.020 --> 56:14.980
Ignition. Ignition. Ignition.

56:15.020 --> 56:16.534
Sure you doing it right?

56:16.574 --> 56:17.000
Car on.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.058
Oh! [chuckles]

56:19.098 --> 56:21.000
I guess my car likes you.

56:22.000 --> 56:22.980
Maybe we should get going?

56:23.020 --> 56:24.011
-[both exclaiming]

56:24.051 --> 56:25.071
-[engine revving]

56:40.000 --> 56:42.980
[chuckles] Mas O Menos?

56:43.020 --> 56:43.980
Hilarious.

56:44.020 --> 56:45.000
Right. Remember?

56:46.000 --> 56:46.457
-Yeah, I remember.

56:46.497 --> 56:46.980
-For our first date.

56:47.020 --> 56:48.174
Remember, we had to share

56:48.214 --> 56:48.980
a plate of tacos,

56:49.020 --> 56:49.434
'cause we were

56:49.474 --> 56:49.980
completely broke.

56:50.020 --> 56:51.248
'Cause we were so broke.

56:51.288 --> 56:51.980
Totally broke.

56:52.020 --> 56:54.754
[laughs] Okay, significant

56:54.794 --> 56:56.980
restaurant. I get it.

56:57.020 --> 56:58.980
I just thought it would maybe

56:59.020 --> 57:00.980
be funny or ironic, you know?

57:01.020 --> 57:02.394
To come... To come here

57:02.434 --> 57:03.980
for our business casual...

57:04.020 --> 57:05.980
non-date outing.

57:06.020 --> 57:07.446
-Yeah, it's ironic.

57:07.486 --> 57:08.000
-Right?

57:09.000 --> 57:09.980
[chuckles]

57:10.020 --> 57:11.593
-Yeah, let's go see it.

57:11.633 --> 57:13.000
-Yeah, let's see it.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
[whispers]  Nice one.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
d

57:31.000 --> 57:31.869
So, my wife she tells me,

57:31.909 --> 57:32.980
"No, wear this. It looks good."

57:33.020 --> 57:33.980
And I said, "It does."

57:34.020 --> 57:34.906
-Here it is.

57:34.946 --> 57:35.980
-Yep. [laughs]

57:36.020 --> 57:36.620
She's very knowledgeable

57:36.660 --> 57:36.980
about fashion.

57:37.020 --> 57:37.983
-Oh, hello.

57:38.023 --> 57:38.980
-Hi, there.

57:39.020 --> 57:40.228
Um, I think we have

57:40.268 --> 57:41.980
a reservation under Peters?

57:42.020 --> 57:42.980
Oh, Miss Peters!

57:43.020 --> 57:43.980
[speaking Spanish]

57:44.020 --> 57:45.711
We are so happy to have you

57:45.751 --> 57:46.980
back at Mas O Menos.

57:47.020 --> 57:48.213
And Mr. Churchill,

57:48.253 --> 57:49.980
welcome,  senor,  welcome.

57:50.020 --> 57:50.628
-Come, come with me.

57:50.668 --> 57:50.980
-Thank you.

57:51.020 --> 57:52.980
[speaking Spanish]

57:53.020 --> 57:53.565
I had to put both of our names

57:53.605 --> 57:53.980
down to get the table.

57:54.020 --> 57:54.810
-Pulling us.

57:54.850 --> 57:55.980
-He's pulling us.

57:56.020 --> 57:57.980
Oh! [chuckles]

57:58.020 --> 57:59.980
The table's that way?

58:00.020 --> 58:00.980
[speaking Spanish]

58:01.020 --> 58:01.980
No, no, no.

58:02.020 --> 58:03.103
Oh, no, this is not

58:03.143 --> 58:03.980
a dancing date.

58:04.020 --> 58:04.966
-This is not a dancing date.

58:05.006 --> 58:05.980
-We're doing business casual.

58:06.020 --> 58:07.018
This is business.

58:07.058 --> 58:07.980
Business casual.

58:08.020 --> 58:09.980
Dancers all for you.

58:10.020 --> 58:10.706
The musician is for you

58:10.746 --> 58:10.980
to dance.

58:11.020 --> 58:12.038
Okay. I don't think he's gonna

58:12.078 --> 58:13.698
let us eat unless we dance.

58:14.000 --> 58:14.647
Oh, no, that's okay,

58:14.687 --> 58:14.980
thank you.

58:15.020 --> 58:15.740
So, I'm starving,

58:15.780 --> 58:16.980
so let's just do this, okay?

58:17.020 --> 58:17.980
[laughs] Okay.

58:18.020 --> 58:19.980
[music continues]

58:20.020 --> 58:20.942
You know what,

58:20.982 --> 58:23.000
I'm overdressed. That's on me.

58:25.000 --> 58:25.980
[George] Um...

58:26.020 --> 58:26.224
[Carol]

58:26.264 --> 58:27.584
Is he dancing with us?

58:26.264 --> 58:28.000
-[Carol] Yeah.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
-Should we try to go that way?

58:29.000 --> 58:29.980
Just casually...

58:30.020 --> 58:30.460
[George] All right,

58:30.500 --> 58:30.980
we're going this way.

58:31.020 --> 58:32.000
d

58:33.000 --> 58:33.605
-Let's try this way.

58:33.645 --> 58:33.980
-He's quick.

58:34.020 --> 58:34.980
He's watching us like a hawk.

58:35.020 --> 58:35.985
We'll go this way.

58:36.025 --> 58:36.980
Let's go this way.

58:37.020 --> 58:37.619
[restaurant manager

58:37.659 --> 58:37.980
exclaiming]

58:38.020 --> 58:38.980
Whoa! There's two of 'em.

58:39.020 --> 58:40.650
-Oh, my God, he's like a bull.

58:40.690 --> 58:40.980
-Yeah.

58:41.020 --> 58:41.659
-I shouldn't have worn red.

58:41.699 --> 58:41.980
-[both laugh]

58:42.020 --> 58:44.631
-Okay, let's do a little turn.

58:44.671 --> 58:44.980
-Oh!

58:45.020 --> 58:46.980
Uh-huh. Yes.

58:47.020 --> 58:47.980
[Carol laughs]

58:48.020 --> 58:49.336
-You always had skills.

58:49.376 --> 58:49.980
-[exclaims]

58:50.020 --> 58:51.980
Huh? Works for the turn.

58:52.020 --> 58:53.980
[singing in Spanish]

58:54.020 --> 58:56.000
[both laugh]

58:57.000 --> 58:57.980
[Carol sighs]

58:58.020 --> 58:59.980
You have built up an appetite?

59:00.020 --> 59:01.336
Yes, yes, we've worked up

59:01.376 --> 59:01.980
an appetite.

59:02.020 --> 59:03.235
I will lead you to your table.

59:03.275 --> 59:03.980
[speaking Spanish]

59:04.020 --> 59:06.000
Sorry about the dress.

59:10.000 --> 59:10.465
[George]

59:10.505 --> 59:11.980
This place isn't anything

59:12.020 --> 59:13.980
like I remember it being.

59:14.020 --> 59:14.687
There's fewer

59:14.727 --> 59:15.980
dead cockroaches around.

59:16.020 --> 59:17.285
-That's what it is!

59:17.325 --> 59:19.000
-Yeah. Well, that's good.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.277
Marginally nicer place

59:21.317 --> 59:22.037
to catch up.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
And why are we catching up?

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Well, um,

59:31.000 --> 59:32.980
I just...

59:33.020 --> 59:34.341
never actually

59:34.381 --> 59:35.980
told you sorry...

59:36.020 --> 59:37.980
you know, for...

59:38.020 --> 59:39.980
kinda everything. [chuckles]

59:40.020 --> 59:41.433
And I know it was my fault

59:41.473 --> 59:42.980
why we ended up breaking up,

59:43.020 --> 59:44.892
and I don't know why,

59:44.932 --> 59:46.980
I just thought I had to

59:47.020 --> 59:48.518
become something else,

59:48.558 --> 59:49.980
or do something else,

59:50.020 --> 59:51.320
or I don't know,

59:51.360 --> 59:53.000
save the world or...

59:54.000 --> 59:54.980
I don't know, and I just...

59:55.020 --> 59:56.985
I thought that had

59:57.025 --> 59:58.980
to come before us.

59:59.020 --> 59:59.958
I guess I thought

59:59.998 --> 1:00:00.980
I should bring you

1:00:01.020 --> 1:00:01.405
to this

1:00:01.445 --> 1:00:02.980
business casual setting...

1:00:03.020 --> 1:00:04.000
[chuckles]

1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:06.980
...and actually apologize,

1:00:07.020 --> 1:00:09.980
'cause I am sorry.

1:00:10.020 --> 1:00:11.980
Well, it's fine. I...

1:00:12.020 --> 1:00:13.451
I business casually

1:00:13.491 --> 1:00:15.000
accept your apology.

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:19.980
'Cause you, uh, deserve...

1:00:20.020 --> 1:00:21.980
I deserve what?

1:00:22.020 --> 1:00:24.000
[music continues]

1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:26.000
...better.

1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:28.071
You deserve better

1:00:28.111 --> 1:00:28.980
than how I was.

1:00:29.020 --> 1:00:30.275
Well, that was always

1:00:30.315 --> 1:00:32.000
our biggest argument, right?

1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:34.884
And, you know,

1:00:34.924 --> 1:00:35.980
the truth is I...

1:00:36.020 --> 1:00:37.756
I haven't found anybody

1:00:37.796 --> 1:00:38.980
better than you.

1:00:39.020 --> 1:00:39.980
Not yet.

1:00:40.020 --> 1:00:41.980
But key word there "yet."

1:00:42.020 --> 1:00:43.404
-Oh, quite the player.

1:00:43.444 --> 1:00:43.980
-Exactly.

1:00:44.020 --> 1:00:45.406
-I'm tall, tan and tenured.

1:00:45.446 --> 1:00:45.980
-[chuckles]

1:00:46.020 --> 1:00:47.004
I wear corduroy jackets.

1:00:47.044 --> 1:00:47.980
Things are easy for me.

1:00:48.020 --> 1:00:49.858
For the special couple,

1:00:49.898 --> 1:00:51.980
I made these just for you.

1:00:52.020 --> 1:00:52.417
-[laughs] Thank you.

1:00:52.457 --> 1:00:52.980
-[speaking Spanish] Enjoy.

1:00:53.020 --> 1:00:55.267
-He wears corduroy.

1:00:55.307 --> 1:00:55.980
-A-ha.

1:00:56.020 --> 1:00:56.980
[both laughing]

1:00:57.020 --> 1:00:58.424
All right, well, listen,

1:00:58.464 --> 1:00:59.980
thank you for the apology.

1:01:00.020 --> 1:01:01.980
It really means a lot to me.

1:01:02.020 --> 1:01:02.344
But, you know,

1:01:02.384 --> 1:01:03.884
I'm gonna be leaving soon

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:04.881
and embarking on my new,

1:01:04.921 --> 1:01:05.980
glamorous European lifestyle.

1:01:06.020 --> 1:01:07.510
Oh, I wasn't... I wasn't aware

1:01:07.550 --> 1:01:08.980
it was a glamorous lifestyle.

1:01:09.020 --> 1:01:10.372
Yes. Yeah, I'm gonna wear

1:01:10.412 --> 1:01:11.980
bikini underwear from now on.

1:01:12.020 --> 1:01:12.852
But for tonight,

1:01:12.892 --> 1:01:14.152
how about no regrets?

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:15.747
To no regrets

1:01:15.787 --> 1:01:16.980
and Irish adventures.

1:01:17.020 --> 1:01:19.000
[George chuckles]

1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:22.980
[both groan]

1:01:23.020 --> 1:01:23.980
[gurgling]

1:01:24.020 --> 1:01:25.980
I can't get it down.

1:01:26.020 --> 1:01:29.000
d

1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:32.080
What is happening?

1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:36.033
I think they've really

1:01:36.073 --> 1:01:36.980
been focusing on us.

1:01:37.020 --> 1:01:38.698
No, I think they do this

1:01:38.738 --> 1:01:40.000
at all the tables.

1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.952
Right, right over here.

1:01:51.992 --> 1:01:52.980
[laughs]

1:01:53.020 --> 1:01:53.256
You're...

1:01:53.296 --> 1:01:53.980
You're sticking to that?

1:01:54.020 --> 1:01:54.980
Are you saying that you think

1:01:55.020 --> 1:01:56.135
salmonella is worse

1:01:56.175 --> 1:01:56.980
than listeria?

1:01:57.020 --> 1:01:57.665
No, no, no. I'm just,

1:01:57.705 --> 1:01:58.305
I'm saying

1:01:59.000 --> 1:01:59.480
that if we have

1:01:59.520 --> 1:01:59.980
food poisoning,

1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:01.784
I'd rather have listeria

1:02:01.824 --> 1:02:02.980
than salmonella.

1:02:03.020 --> 1:02:03.823
Because I can take

1:02:03.863 --> 1:02:04.980
antibiotics for listeria,

1:02:05.020 --> 1:02:06.760
but you can't for salmonella.

1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:07.413
Okay, but we,

1:02:07.453 --> 1:02:07.980
just to be clear,

1:02:08.020 --> 1:02:09.065
we definitely, we still have

1:02:09.105 --> 1:02:10.545
food poisoning? [laughs]

1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:11.980
Oh, yeah, no, 100%.

1:02:12.020 --> 1:02:12.980
I mean, that was

1:02:13.020 --> 1:02:14.559
E. coli-flavored guacamole

1:02:14.599 --> 1:02:14.980
we ate.

1:02:15.020 --> 1:02:17.980
[Carol whimpers]

1:02:18.020 --> 1:02:18.987
Glad we ran into each other

1:02:19.027 --> 1:02:20.647
today at the grocery store.

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.980
What are the odds, right?

1:02:24.020 --> 1:02:27.011
I mean, quite a coincidence,

1:02:27.051 --> 1:02:27.980
you know?

1:02:28.020 --> 1:02:28.980
It's my lucky day. [chuckles]

1:02:29.020 --> 1:02:30.980
Mine too.

1:02:31.020 --> 1:02:32.000
[chuckles]

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:35.980
Maybe I will, you know,

1:02:36.020 --> 1:02:36.791
give you a call

1:02:36.831 --> 1:02:37.980
or something tomorrow?

1:02:38.020 --> 1:02:39.741
-Maybe I'll pick up. [laughs]

1:02:39.781 --> 1:02:39.980
-Oh.

1:02:40.020 --> 1:02:42.135
No, I mean, I would for sure,

1:02:42.175 --> 1:02:44.000
I would for sure pick up.

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000
-Night.

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:52.730
-[groans]

1:02:52.770 --> 1:02:54.000
-[Carol laughs]

1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000
[sighs]

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:08.869
[Si]  Is talking

1:03:08.909 --> 1:03:09.980
about food poisoning

1:03:10.020 --> 1:03:11.980
and intestinal distress

1:03:12.020 --> 1:03:12.772
a regular part of

1:03:12.812 --> 1:03:13.980
the human courting ritual?

1:03:14.020 --> 1:03:15.153
No, it is not.

1:03:15.193 --> 1:03:16.980
Can we please just go?

1:03:17.020 --> 1:03:18.980
No, Carol.

1:03:19.020 --> 1:03:19.684
Don't these romantic outings

1:03:19.724 --> 1:03:19.980
usually lead

1:03:20.020 --> 1:03:20.858
to interactions of

1:03:20.898 --> 1:03:22.278
a more intimate nature?

1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:23.980
Ugh! Oh, my God.

1:03:24.020 --> 1:03:25.804
I'm not discussing this

1:03:25.844 --> 1:03:26.980
with you, okay?

1:03:27.020 --> 1:03:29.000
I mean, you really do not

1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:30.647
understand

1:03:30.687 --> 1:03:31.980
human relationships.

1:03:32.020 --> 1:03:33.350
His core body temperature

1:03:33.390 --> 1:03:34.980
went up by almost two degrees,

1:03:35.020 --> 1:03:36.980
and his pupils dilated 25%

1:03:37.020 --> 1:03:38.980
every time he looked at you.

1:03:39.020 --> 1:03:39.980
25%, really?

1:03:40.020 --> 1:03:42.261
Is that good or a lot?

1:03:42.301 --> 1:03:42.980
I mean,

1:03:43.020 --> 1:03:44.980
25% kind of seems...

1:03:45.020 --> 1:03:45.556
[whispers]

1:03:45.596 --> 1:03:46.980
kind of seems like a lot.

1:03:47.020 --> 1:03:48.488
It's amazing that you humans

1:03:48.528 --> 1:03:49.980
reproduce as fast as you do.

1:03:50.020 --> 1:03:51.426
Oh, my God. Okay, can--

1:03:51.466 --> 1:03:52.980
Let's just go, all right?

1:03:53.020 --> 1:03:54.112
Sorry, we're having mechanical

1:03:54.152 --> 1:03:54.980
difficulties right now.

1:03:55.020 --> 1:03:56.349
Well, you know what,

1:03:56.389 --> 1:03:57.388
then I'm just gonna call

1:03:57.428 --> 1:03:57.980
for a ride.

1:03:58.020 --> 1:03:59.081
Sorry, your phone

1:03:59.121 --> 1:03:59.980
is also having

1:04:00.020 --> 1:04:00.685
mechanical difficulties

1:04:00.725 --> 1:04:00.980
right now.

1:04:01.020 --> 1:04:02.292
So is every phone

1:04:02.332 --> 1:04:03.980
in a ten-block radius.

1:04:04.020 --> 1:04:04.743
Oh, my God!

1:04:04.783 --> 1:04:05.980
You can't do that.

1:04:06.020 --> 1:04:07.510
I do think, however, the phone

1:04:07.550 --> 1:04:08.980
in George's house is working.

1:04:09.020 --> 1:04:09.562
You can call a ride

1:04:09.602 --> 1:04:09.980
from in there.

1:04:10.020 --> 1:04:11.368
Okay, I don't know

1:04:11.408 --> 1:04:12.980
what kind of stunt...

1:04:13.020 --> 1:04:13.541
-[beeping]

1:04:13.581 --> 1:04:13.980
-[gasps]

1:04:14.020 --> 1:04:15.980
Do not do that.

1:04:16.020 --> 1:04:16.675
-I didn't do anything.

1:04:16.715 --> 1:04:16.980
-[beeping]

1:04:17.020 --> 1:04:18.980
Okay, stop it.

1:04:19.020 --> 1:04:19.400
-That isn't me.

1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:19.980
-Okay, you know what?

1:04:20.020 --> 1:04:20.603
I get what you're doing,

1:04:20.643 --> 1:04:20.980
and it's not...

1:04:21.020 --> 1:04:21.980
It must be the car.

1:04:22.020 --> 1:04:23.980
There must be some sort of

1:04:24.020 --> 1:04:24.565
mechanical problem

1:04:24.605 --> 1:04:24.980
with the car.

1:04:25.020 --> 1:04:25.980
Oh, my God.

1:04:26.020 --> 1:04:27.156
-I'm not controlling it.

1:04:27.196 --> 1:04:27.980
-Stop doing that!

1:04:28.020 --> 1:04:28.509
-Carol, it isn't me.

1:04:28.549 --> 1:04:28.679
I guarantee you...

1:04:28.719 --> 1:04:28.980
-[phone clatters]

1:04:29.020 --> 1:04:30.980
You made me drop my phone!

1:04:31.020 --> 1:04:31.736
-...I have no part in this.

1:04:31.776 --> 1:04:31.980
-Stop it!

1:04:32.020 --> 1:04:33.000
d

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:34.521
[Si]  Wow.

1:04:34.561 --> 1:04:35.980
Overshot that a little bit.

1:04:36.020 --> 1:04:36.980
That was funny though.

1:04:37.020 --> 1:04:37.986
Was it funny to you?

1:04:38.026 --> 1:04:38.980
It felt funny to me.

1:04:39.020 --> 1:04:40.980
[panting heavily]

1:04:41.020 --> 1:04:42.980
How dare you?

1:04:43.020 --> 1:04:43.905
[Si]  I can't hear you.

1:04:43.945 --> 1:04:44.980
I've just put the radio on.

1:04:45.020 --> 1:04:45.627
This is why

1:04:45.667 --> 1:04:46.980
people hate technology.

1:04:47.020 --> 1:04:47.980
[Si]  Can't hear a thing. Bye!

1:04:48.020 --> 1:04:50.000
I hope you get a virus!

1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:07.491
[Donahue]

1:05:07.531 --> 1:05:08.980
Target alpha has returned.

1:05:09.020 --> 1:05:10.980
Acquisition time 22:44.

1:05:11.020 --> 1:05:12.257
Surveillance hand off

1:05:12.297 --> 1:05:12.980
established.

1:05:13.020 --> 1:05:14.441
Team one has eyes

1:05:14.481 --> 1:05:15.980
and will maintain.

1:05:16.020 --> 1:05:18.000
d

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:21.768
Hi. I don't think

1:05:21.808 --> 1:05:23.368
that my car really wants--

1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:27.492
[Kuiper]

1:05:27.532 --> 1:05:28.980
That escalated quickly.

1:05:29.020 --> 1:05:29.980
[Donahue] That is passion.

1:05:30.020 --> 1:05:31.122
[Kuiper] I have never had

1:05:31.162 --> 1:05:31.980
a moment like that.

1:05:32.020 --> 1:05:33.980
[Donahue] Not in my life.

1:05:34.020 --> 1:05:34.760
-[Kuiper] Yep.

1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:35.980
-[Donahue] My, oh, my.

1:05:36.020 --> 1:05:37.004
[Kuiper] Struggling with

1:05:37.044 --> 1:05:37.980
the shirt a little bit.

1:05:38.020 --> 1:05:38.598
[Donahue] Always wanna

1:05:38.638 --> 1:05:38.980
undo the cuffs

1:05:39.020 --> 1:05:40.152
-of the sleeve first.

1:05:40.192 --> 1:05:40.980
-[Kuiper] Yeah.

1:05:41.020 --> 1:05:42.133
-Hey, mix in a bedroom.

1:05:42.173 --> 1:05:42.980
-[Donahue laughs]

1:05:43.020 --> 1:05:44.387
-You know what I mean? Yeah?

1:05:44.427 --> 1:05:44.980
-Yeah, I do.

1:05:45.020 --> 1:05:46.980
I'm a passionless guy.

1:05:47.020 --> 1:05:47.744
-[Donahue] Yeah?

1:05:47.784 --> 1:05:48.980
-That's what my wife says.

1:05:49.020 --> 1:05:50.980
I gotta call my wife.

1:05:51.020 --> 1:05:53.012
Yeah? If she'd take my calls,

1:05:53.052 --> 1:05:53.980
I'd call mine.

1:05:54.020 --> 1:05:54.980
[Kuiper] This is nice.

1:05:55.020 --> 1:05:55.980
These are nice people.

1:05:56.020 --> 1:05:56.536
It's not

1:05:56.576 --> 1:05:57.980
like the Russian mob,

1:05:58.020 --> 1:05:59.412
-or, you know, a serial killer

1:05:59.195 --> 1:05:59.980
-[Donahue] Yeah, serial killer.

1:05:59.452 --> 1:06:00.020
or whatever.

1:06:00.020 --> 1:06:01.869
It's a nice change of pace.

1:06:01.909 --> 1:06:02.980
I appreciate it.

1:06:03.020 --> 1:06:03.929
I mean, I guess,

1:06:03.969 --> 1:06:04.980
on the other hand,

1:06:05.020 --> 1:06:05.571
this thing

1:06:05.611 --> 1:06:06.980
could destroy the earth.

1:06:07.020 --> 1:06:07.468
-[both laughing]

1:06:07.508 --> 1:06:07.980
-You ain't wrong.

1:06:08.020 --> 1:06:08.980
Oh, my God.

1:06:09.020 --> 1:06:10.079
[Kuiper] You're crushing

1:06:10.119 --> 1:06:10.980
your blinds, mister.

1:06:11.020 --> 1:06:12.460
[Donahue laughing] Yeah.

1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:21.980
I mean, I really, really think

1:06:22.020 --> 1:06:22.549
that your coffee maker

1:06:22.589 --> 1:06:22.980
might be magical.

1:06:23.020 --> 1:06:23.448
I know.

1:06:23.488 --> 1:06:24.980
It's like it was forged

1:06:25.020 --> 1:06:26.277
in an ancient mountain

1:06:26.317 --> 1:06:26.980
by the gods.

1:06:27.020 --> 1:06:28.400
Oh, like Thor's hammer?

1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:29.980
Or the Hobbit ring?

1:06:30.020 --> 1:06:30.980
Or as the orcs called it,

1:06:31.020 --> 1:06:32.980
the  Ash nazg...

1:06:33.020 --> 1:06:34.000
What is that?

1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:36.588
Ash nazg...  [laughing]

1:06:36.628 --> 1:06:37.980
Something like that.

1:06:38.020 --> 1:06:38.980
Oh, my God.

1:06:39.020 --> 1:06:40.604
-What are you talking about?

1:06:40.644 --> 1:06:41.980
-It's the Tolkien books.

1:06:42.020 --> 1:06:43.022
I taught them last semester.

1:06:43.062 --> 1:06:44.622
But I was way too excited.

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:45.620
Kids thought I was crazy.

1:06:45.660 --> 1:06:45.980
You know what?

1:06:46.020 --> 1:06:47.980
I'm bringing it to Ireland.

1:06:48.020 --> 1:06:49.144
I'm flip-flopping.

1:06:49.184 --> 1:06:50.000
I don't care.

1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:53.000
[George] Mmm.

1:06:59.000 --> 1:06:59.647
You know,

1:06:59.687 --> 1:07:00.980
for just a minute,

1:07:01.020 --> 1:07:02.986
I had forgot about you

1:07:03.026 --> 1:07:04.980
leaving in a few days.

1:07:05.020 --> 1:07:05.345
Oh, you mean,

1:07:05.385 --> 1:07:05.980
you thought these boxes

1:07:06.020 --> 1:07:07.488
were my attempt

1:07:07.528 --> 1:07:09.000
at shabby chic?

1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:14.980
Play hooky with me today.

1:07:15.020 --> 1:07:16.881
I'll help you pack

1:07:16.921 --> 1:07:19.000
for your trip later.

1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.980
All right, it's a deal.

1:07:23.020 --> 1:07:23.980
What'd you have in mind?

1:07:24.020 --> 1:07:25.980
Sky's the limit, you know.

1:07:26.020 --> 1:07:28.676
Give me your best, outrageous

1:07:28.716 --> 1:07:31.000
scenario for a hooky day.

1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:34.000
[George] Hmm.

1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000
I want...

1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:43.980
dim sum for breakfast.

1:07:44.020 --> 1:07:45.814
-You're terrible at this.

1:07:45.854 --> 1:07:46.980
-[both laughing]

1:07:47.020 --> 1:07:48.247
Wait a minute. Do you

1:07:48.287 --> 1:07:49.980
understand what I'm offering?

1:07:50.020 --> 1:07:51.000
Yeah.

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:53.080
Okay, in no limit,

1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:54.408
-go crazy...

1:07:54.448 --> 1:07:55.408
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:57.114
-You Suge Knight?

1:07:57.154 --> 1:07:58.000
-[both laugh]

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.157
Like a Ferris Bueller

1:08:02.197 --> 1:08:02.980
day off,

1:08:03.020 --> 1:08:04.540
-you know, hooky day.

1:08:04.580 --> 1:08:04.980
-Yeah.

1:08:05.020 --> 1:08:05.458
And you're really

1:08:05.498 --> 1:08:05.980
asking for dim sum?

1:08:06.020 --> 1:08:07.683
Yeah, I want pork dumplings.

1:08:07.723 --> 1:08:08.223
Yeah.

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:12.000
Okay.

1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:15.260
Remember this moment.

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:17.980
[whispers] Shanghai dumplings?

1:08:18.020 --> 1:08:18.422
[in normal voice]

1:08:18.462 --> 1:08:18.980
How would I know that?

1:08:19.020 --> 1:08:20.980
-What?

1:08:21.020 --> 1:08:22.052
You keep talking

1:08:22.092 --> 1:08:22.980
to your phone.

1:08:23.020 --> 1:08:24.000
What's in there?

1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:25.586
-Don't spill my coffee!

1:08:25.626 --> 1:08:25.980
-Let me see it.

1:08:26.020 --> 1:08:27.980
It's my personal dumpling--

1:08:28.020 --> 1:08:28.424
What are you doing

1:08:28.464 --> 1:08:28.980
with that phone, woman?

1:08:29.020 --> 1:08:30.340
[upbeat music playing]

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000
[man shouts]

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:45.980
d

1:08:46.020 --> 1:08:46.803
I was just gonna

1:08:46.843 --> 1:08:47.980
microwave the dumplings

1:08:48.020 --> 1:08:49.980
I have in my freezer,

1:08:50.020 --> 1:08:52.933
but that was so much better.

1:08:52.973 --> 1:08:53.980
Thank you.

1:08:54.020 --> 1:08:55.209
Well, the dumplings were good,

1:08:55.249 --> 1:08:55.980
I'll give you that,

1:08:56.020 --> 1:08:57.939
but dumplings are here.

1:08:57.979 --> 1:08:59.980
What's to come? Up here.

1:09:00.020 --> 1:09:00.980
[George] What is that?

1:09:01.020 --> 1:09:01.485
-What do you mean?

1:09:01.525 --> 1:09:01.980
-Oh, it's up here.

1:09:02.020 --> 1:09:02.760
-There's more?

1:09:02.800 --> 1:09:03.980
-It's a hand flourish.

1:09:04.020 --> 1:09:04.725
-It's a surprise.

1:09:04.765 --> 1:09:05.265
-Oh...

1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:07.980
Hold on.

1:09:08.020 --> 1:09:09.891
-Oh, that's what tripe is.

1:09:09.931 --> 1:09:10.980
-Oh, no, don't.

1:09:11.020 --> 1:09:11.980
This is incredible.

1:09:12.020 --> 1:09:12.980
Hey, what is this, sir?

1:09:13.020 --> 1:09:13.712
-[man] Yes, sir.

1:09:13.752 --> 1:09:14.980
-What is... Is that a snout?

1:09:15.020 --> 1:09:15.834
[man] No, sir.

1:09:15.874 --> 1:09:16.980
Those are pig feet.

1:09:17.020 --> 1:09:17.374
-That's pig feet?

1:09:17.414 --> 1:09:17.980
-[man] That's a pig's feet.

1:09:18.020 --> 1:09:18.891
-Could you eat the snout?

1:09:18.931 --> 1:09:19.980
-No, you cannot eat the snout.

1:09:20.020 --> 1:09:21.304
Really? That's the only piece

1:09:21.344 --> 1:09:21.980
you don't have.

1:09:22.020 --> 1:09:23.097
What part of the pig

1:09:23.137 --> 1:09:23.980
is in dumplings?

1:09:24.020 --> 1:09:25.980
I don't know.

1:09:26.020 --> 1:09:27.365
-That's not good.

1:09:27.405 --> 1:09:29.000
-Don't ask him that.

1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:58.140
[Dennis] Follow me.

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:00.980
What the hell is this?

1:10:01.020 --> 1:10:02.814
Oh, well, moving forward,

1:10:02.854 --> 1:10:03.980
Madam President,

1:10:04.020 --> 1:10:05.157
there are no more computers,

1:10:05.197 --> 1:10:05.980
no more cell phones.

1:10:06.020 --> 1:10:06.967
We're in the chalet because

1:10:07.007 --> 1:10:08.687
it's completely off the grid

1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:09.403
and it's built

1:10:09.443 --> 1:10:09.980
like a Faraday cage

1:10:10.020 --> 1:10:10.582
to block out

1:10:10.622 --> 1:10:11.980
all electromagnetic signals.

1:10:12.020 --> 1:10:13.980
So, how are we coordinating

1:10:14.020 --> 1:10:15.423
the largest global operation

1:10:15.463 --> 1:10:15.980
in history?

1:10:16.020 --> 1:10:17.942
Excellent question, as always,

1:10:17.982 --> 1:10:18.980
Madam President.

1:10:19.020 --> 1:10:19.980
Well, I guess you can say

1:10:20.020 --> 1:10:20.908
that we're doing it

1:10:20.948 --> 1:10:22.268
the old-fashioned way.

1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.000
d

1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:36.447
[General Gomez] Thank you

1:10:36.487 --> 1:10:36.980
for coming, Madam President.

1:10:37.020 --> 1:10:38.285
We're just about to

1:10:38.325 --> 1:10:39.980
start the mission update.

1:10:40.020 --> 1:10:41.245
At 0600 GMT,

1:10:41.285 --> 1:10:43.980
Operation Sahara commenced

1:10:44.020 --> 1:10:45.441
in the Xinjiang province

1:10:45.481 --> 1:10:45.980
of China.

1:10:46.020 --> 1:10:47.404
Power plants and telephone

1:10:47.444 --> 1:10:48.980
trunk lines were neutralized.

1:10:49.020 --> 1:10:50.980
And in the last five hours,

1:10:51.020 --> 1:10:51.980
the shutdown has proceeded

1:10:52.020 --> 1:10:52.810
in the eastern

1:10:52.850 --> 1:10:53.980
and western regions,

1:10:54.020 --> 1:10:56.041
including parts of India

1:10:56.081 --> 1:10:57.000
and Russia.

1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.310
Everyone's adhering

1:11:02.350 --> 1:11:03.980
to the tech limitations.

1:11:04.020 --> 1:11:05.133
Only mechanical watches

1:11:05.173 --> 1:11:05.980
for coordination.

1:11:06.020 --> 1:11:08.139
No vehicles built after 1981

1:11:08.179 --> 1:11:08.980
are in use.

1:11:09.020 --> 1:11:09.480
What about

1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:10.980
civilian information blackout?

1:11:11.020 --> 1:11:12.980
Anything leaked?

1:11:13.020 --> 1:11:14.980
So far, nothing.

1:11:15.020 --> 1:11:16.257
The solar flare story

1:11:16.297 --> 1:11:16.980
has held up.

1:11:17.020 --> 1:11:18.584
And the, uh, AI,

1:11:18.624 --> 1:11:20.980
is it aware of anything?

1:11:21.020 --> 1:11:22.240
Well, that's difficult

1:11:22.280 --> 1:11:22.980
to ascertain,

1:11:23.020 --> 1:11:23.980
but our monitoring shows

1:11:24.020 --> 1:11:25.485
little new activity

1:11:25.525 --> 1:11:26.980
on neural networks.

1:11:27.020 --> 1:11:27.980
Meaning?

1:11:28.020 --> 1:11:29.559
That we could possibly

1:11:29.599 --> 1:11:31.000
pull this thing off.

1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:39.379
[whispering]

1:11:39.419 --> 1:11:39.980
Thank you so much.

1:11:40.020 --> 1:11:41.000
[clears throat]

1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:44.950
-[George] Red boat! Red boat!

1:11:44.990 --> 1:11:45.980
-[Carol] Come on! Green! Green!

1:11:46.020 --> 1:11:47.435
-[George] Red boat! Red boat!

1:11:47.475 --> 1:11:48.980
-[Carol] Green! Green boat. No!

1:11:49.020 --> 1:11:49.053
d

1:11:49.093 --> 1:11:50.980
The winner is the red boat.

1:11:51.020 --> 1:11:52.143
So, if you picked red,

1:11:52.183 --> 1:11:52.980
congratulations.

1:11:53.020 --> 1:11:54.296
If you picked green

1:11:54.336 --> 1:11:54.980
or yellow,

1:11:55.020 --> 1:11:56.137
I'm afraid we're gonna have

1:11:56.177 --> 1:11:56.980
to ask you to leave.

1:11:57.020 --> 1:11:57.598
Oh, it's James Corden.

1:11:57.638 --> 1:11:57.980
It's your man.

1:11:58.020 --> 1:12:00.980
Yay, sports.

1:12:01.020 --> 1:12:02.052
-He's all right.

1:12:02.092 --> 1:12:02.980
-You love him.

1:12:03.020 --> 1:12:03.929
Hey, how did you

1:12:03.969 --> 1:12:04.980
get these tickets?

1:12:05.020 --> 1:12:06.334
We got an entire luxury box

1:12:06.374 --> 1:12:06.980
to ourselves.

1:12:07.020 --> 1:12:07.920
I have a friend

1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:08.980
in the tech world

1:12:09.020 --> 1:12:10.168
and he can get any ticket,

1:12:10.208 --> 1:12:10.980
whatever he wants.

1:12:11.020 --> 1:12:11.203
Really?

1:12:11.243 --> 1:12:11.980
Friend in the tech world.

1:12:12.020 --> 1:12:13.600
-[woman] Miss Peters?

1:12:13.640 --> 1:12:13.980
-Yes.

1:12:14.020 --> 1:12:14.980
You have a guest.

1:12:15.020 --> 1:12:16.275
Hello. Heard you guys

1:12:16.315 --> 1:12:17.980
are really big Mariner fans.

1:12:18.020 --> 1:12:18.980
[whispers] Oh, my God.

1:12:19.020 --> 1:12:20.320
What did you do,

1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:21.980
Carol Vivian Peters?

1:12:22.020 --> 1:12:22.980
Wow.

1:12:23.020 --> 1:12:24.980
Mr. Ken Griffey Jr.,

1:12:25.020 --> 1:12:25.570
I'm your biggest fan,

1:12:25.610 --> 1:12:25.980
Mr. Griffey Jr.

1:12:26.020 --> 1:12:27.980
No, just call me Ken, George.

1:12:28.020 --> 1:12:28.957
-He knows my name.

1:12:28.997 --> 1:12:29.980
-[chuckles] I know.

1:12:30.020 --> 1:12:31.980
Hi, Ken, I'm Carol.

1:12:32.020 --> 1:12:33.700
Hi, Carol. I wanna thank you

1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:34.451
for the donation

1:12:34.491 --> 1:12:34.980
to the foundation.

1:12:35.020 --> 1:12:35.636
It's gonna go a long way

1:12:35.676 --> 1:12:35.980
for the kids.

1:12:36.020 --> 1:12:36.797
Oh, well, I mean,

1:12:36.837 --> 1:12:38.337
you do so much great work

1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:39.665
in the community and I just,

1:12:39.705 --> 1:12:39.980
I mean, my...

1:12:40.020 --> 1:12:41.980
The foundation I work for

1:12:42.020 --> 1:12:43.194
just really wanted to be sure

1:12:43.234 --> 1:12:43.980
they supported you.

1:12:44.020 --> 1:12:44.282
So, you guys

1:12:44.322 --> 1:12:45.960
are really big Mariner fans?

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:46.980
I have your batting helmet.

1:12:47.020 --> 1:12:48.188
I don't need it anymore.

1:12:48.228 --> 1:12:48.980
You can have it.

1:12:49.020 --> 1:12:50.350
[laughing] He's so funny.

1:12:50.390 --> 1:12:51.980
I didn't know he was so funny.

1:12:52.020 --> 1:12:52.459
Do you guys mind if I watch

1:12:52.499 --> 1:12:52.980
an inning or so with you guys?

1:12:53.020 --> 1:12:54.056
Oh, my God, I love you!

1:12:54.096 --> 1:12:54.980
You're my hero. Yes.

1:12:55.020 --> 1:12:55.367
Hey, everybody,

1:12:55.407 --> 1:12:56.847
I'm gonna watch the game

1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:57.980
with Ken Griffey Jr.!

1:12:58.020 --> 1:12:58.980
It's Ken Griffey Jr.

1:12:59.020 --> 1:12:59.774
Come on, sit.

1:12:59.814 --> 1:13:00.980
Please, have a seat.

1:13:01.020 --> 1:13:01.390
Can I get you

1:13:01.430 --> 1:13:01.980
something to drink?

1:13:02.020 --> 1:13:03.144
A soda, or a beer,

1:13:03.184 --> 1:13:03.980
or something?

1:13:04.020 --> 1:13:04.487
No, I'm good. But if you

1:13:04.527 --> 1:13:05.967
find a hat or something,

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:06.560
I'd be more than happy

1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:06.980
to autograph it.

1:13:07.020 --> 1:13:07.561
Hat. Hat.

1:13:07.601 --> 1:13:08.980
I'm gonna go get hats.

1:13:09.020 --> 1:13:09.980
Carol, I'm gonna go get hats.

1:13:10.020 --> 1:13:10.980
I'll get 'em. I'll get 'em.

1:13:11.020 --> 1:13:11.557
-Really?

1:13:11.597 --> 1:13:11.980
-Yeah.

1:13:12.020 --> 1:13:12.629
Thank you.

1:13:12.669 --> 1:13:13.980
Okay, I'll stay here.

1:13:14.020 --> 1:13:14.667
-Okay. All right.

1:13:14.707 --> 1:13:14.980
-Thanks.

1:13:15.020 --> 1:13:16.980
I'm gonna go get 'em.

1:13:17.020 --> 1:13:17.980
Could we take a picture?

1:13:18.020 --> 1:13:18.446
-Yeah.

1:13:18.486 --> 1:13:19.980
-Yeah? Is that okay?

1:13:20.020 --> 1:13:22.000
Okay, here you go, and cheese!

1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:23.347
-Say "cheese."

1:13:23.387 --> 1:13:23.980
-[camera shutter clicks]

1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:25.379
-[softly] Can I see it?

1:13:25.419 --> 1:13:25.980
-Oh. Yeah.

1:13:26.020 --> 1:13:27.160
Oh, that's awesome.

1:13:26.020 --> 1:13:28.000
with the crowd in the back?

1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:29.000
Can we get one

1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:29.480
-Yeah.

1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:30.000
-Okay.

1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.980
All right, big smile.

1:13:33.020 --> 1:13:34.428
Okay, on three. One, two,

1:13:34.468 --> 1:13:35.980
three, "George is awesome."

1:13:36.020 --> 1:13:37.534

1:13:37.574 --> 1:13:37.980
-Great.

1:13:38.020 --> 1:13:38.980
Wow, you're photogenic.

1:13:39.020 --> 1:13:40.194
Hey, can I ask you a question

1:13:40.234 --> 1:13:40.980
about the '95 ALDS?

1:13:41.020 --> 1:13:41.827
I know you've probably

1:13:41.867 --> 1:13:42.980
answered this a million times,

1:13:43.020 --> 1:13:44.980
but when you're on first base

1:13:45.020 --> 1:13:45.554
and Edgar comes to the plates,

1:13:45.594 --> 1:13:45.980
bottom of the eleventh,

1:13:46.020 --> 1:13:46.652
what's going through

1:13:46.692 --> 1:13:46.980
your head?

1:13:47.020 --> 1:13:48.000
Score.

1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:49.980
Oh, my God!

1:13:50.020 --> 1:13:51.302
Ken Griffey Jr. and I

1:13:51.342 --> 1:13:52.980
are getting along so great!

1:13:53.020 --> 1:13:55.000

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:00.000

-Oh, my God.

1:14:02.620 --> 1:14:03.980
-Miss Peters, a word please.

1:14:04.020 --> 1:14:04.980
[Carol grunts]

1:14:05.020 --> 1:14:07.000
[Carol] Get off of me!

1:14:14.020 --> 1:14:15.980

1:14:16.020 --> 1:14:17.980
Stop kicking me in the chest.

1:14:18.020 --> 1:14:18.861
You know what?

1:14:18.901 --> 1:14:20.000
Stop abducting me!

1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:21.980
Didn't he tell you

1:14:22.020 --> 1:14:22.527
that you weren't supposed

1:14:22.567 --> 1:14:22.980
to keep following me?

1:14:23.020 --> 1:14:23.810
And why are we

1:14:23.850 --> 1:14:24.980
in a men's bathroom?

1:14:25.020 --> 1:14:25.720
Stadium bathrooms

1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:26.980
are technological dead zones.

1:14:27.020 --> 1:14:28.341
It's the safest place

1:14:28.381 --> 1:14:28.980
we can be.

1:14:29.020 --> 1:14:29.985
Even your AI buddy

1:14:30.025 --> 1:14:30.980
can't see us here.

1:14:31.020 --> 1:14:32.441
Okay, he's not my buddy,

1:14:32.481 --> 1:14:32.980
you know?

1:14:33.020 --> 1:14:34.880
I mean, are we friendly?

1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:35.980
Yes. I mean...

1:14:36.020 --> 1:14:37.344
But are we friends?

1:14:37.384 --> 1:14:38.980
I don't know. I mean...

1:14:39.020 --> 1:14:39.980
We're not not friends.

1:14:40.020 --> 1:14:41.980
Miss Peters, as we speak,

1:14:42.020 --> 1:14:42.887
the nations of the world

1:14:42.927 --> 1:14:43.980
are pursuing a plan of action

1:14:44.020 --> 1:14:45.980
to contain the AI entity.

1:14:46.020 --> 1:14:46.434
What do you...

1:14:46.474 --> 1:14:46.615
What do you mean?

1:14:46.655 --> 1:14:47.795
What are you doing?

1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:48.980
We're turning off the world.

1:14:49.020 --> 1:14:50.021
All the power.

1:14:50.061 --> 1:14:50.980
All the data.

1:14:51.020 --> 1:14:52.318
We are disconnecting

1:14:52.358 --> 1:14:52.980
the globe.

1:14:53.020 --> 1:14:53.274
-Why?

1:14:53.314 --> 1:14:54.980
-[Donahue] By tomorrow night,

1:14:55.020 --> 1:14:55.857
the AI will be contained

1:14:55.897 --> 1:14:56.980
in a server outside of Seattle.

1:14:57.020 --> 1:14:58.980
Why are you guys so sure

1:14:59.020 --> 1:14:59.366
that he wants

1:14:59.406 --> 1:14:59.980
to destroy the world?

1:15:00.020 --> 1:15:01.980
It's not a "he."

1:15:02.020 --> 1:15:02.349
Okay, fine.

1:15:02.389 --> 1:15:03.529
But how do you know

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:04.526
it doesn't want to

1:15:04.566 --> 1:15:04.980
save the world?

1:15:05.020 --> 1:15:05.765
It doesn't want to

1:15:05.805 --> 1:15:07.485
save the world, Miss Peters.

1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:08.447
Of this,

1:15:08.487 --> 1:15:09.980
we are absolutely certain.

1:15:10.020 --> 1:15:11.220
You don't know that.

1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:14.705
[Donahue] Carol,

1:15:14.745 --> 1:15:15.980
we need you to do your part.

1:15:16.020 --> 1:15:17.980
We're all counting on you.

1:15:18.020 --> 1:15:18.980
Secrecy is key.

1:15:19.020 --> 1:15:19.910
You can tell no one,

1:15:19.950 --> 1:15:20.980
not even Mr. Churchill.

1:15:21.020 --> 1:15:22.980
What am I to say to George?

1:15:23.020 --> 1:15:24.891
"The world's about to end.

1:15:24.931 --> 1:15:25.980
Enjoy Ireland"?

1:15:26.020 --> 1:15:26.980
Just keep him out of this.

1:15:27.020 --> 1:15:28.224
During your communications

1:15:28.264 --> 1:15:28.980
with the entity,

1:15:29.020 --> 1:15:30.861
if there's any indication

1:15:30.901 --> 1:15:30.998
that it's aware

1:15:31.038 --> 1:15:31.980
of what we're doing,

1:15:32.020 --> 1:15:33.985
you need to click this

1:15:34.025 --> 1:15:34.980
four times.

1:15:35.020 --> 1:15:35.980
What does that do?

1:15:36.020 --> 1:15:37.980
It buys us some time.

1:15:38.020 --> 1:15:39.726
It could make the difference.

1:15:39.766 --> 1:15:41.026
Might save the world.

1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:45.980
[Kuiper] Don't click it now.

1:15:46.020 --> 1:15:47.118
I wasn't going to

1:15:47.158 --> 1:15:47.980
click it now.

1:15:48.020 --> 1:15:48.355
-Okay.

1:15:48.395 --> 1:15:49.980
-Why would I click it now?

1:15:50.020 --> 1:15:50.345
-You just said--

1:15:50.385 --> 1:15:50.980
-'Cause it looks like a pen.

1:15:51.020 --> 1:15:51.980
People click pens nervously.

1:15:52.020 --> 1:15:53.063
I'm aware it's a pen.

1:15:53.103 --> 1:15:53.980
Okay, are we done?

1:15:54.020 --> 1:15:55.593
Just... A lot of things happen

1:15:55.633 --> 1:15:57.193
if you click it right now.

1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:00.980
[Carol] Oh, thanks.

1:16:01.020 --> 1:16:01.980

-It's a hard kick.

1:16:05.020 --> 1:16:05.638

1:16:05.678 --> 1:16:06.518

1:16:08.207 --> 1:16:08.980
or something.

1:16:09.020 --> 1:16:09.980
Except she used heel.

1:16:10.020 --> 1:16:11.980
It was a normal kick.

1:16:12.020 --> 1:16:12.513
It was just a kick.

1:16:12.553 --> 1:16:12.980
A kick is a kick.

1:16:13.020 --> 1:16:13.427
[George]

1:16:13.467 --> 1:16:14.980
Ken Griffey Jr. is the best.

1:16:15.020 --> 1:16:15.849
His favorite article

1:16:15.889 --> 1:16:16.980
of clothing is flip-flops.

1:16:17.020 --> 1:16:18.064
His favorite airport

1:16:18.104 --> 1:16:18.980
is in Pittsburgh.

1:16:19.020 --> 1:16:20.824
His favorite food

1:16:20.864 --> 1:16:22.980
is chicken parmesan.

1:16:23.020 --> 1:16:23.452
He doesn't know

1:16:23.492 --> 1:16:23.980
how to ice-skate,

1:16:24.020 --> 1:16:25.980
which is a weird thing

1:16:26.020 --> 1:16:26.274
for one man

1:16:26.314 --> 1:16:26.980
to admit to another, but...

1:16:27.020 --> 1:16:27.987
And he also has

1:16:28.027 --> 1:16:29.980
Michael Jordan's phone number.

1:16:30.020 --> 1:16:31.980
He could pick up the phone

1:16:32.020 --> 1:16:33.261
and call Michael Jordan

1:16:33.301 --> 1:16:33.980
on the phone.

1:16:34.020 --> 1:16:35.517
You found all of that out

1:16:35.557 --> 1:16:36.980
in an inning and a half?

1:16:37.020 --> 1:16:38.279
Yeah, well, imagine if

1:16:38.319 --> 1:16:39.980
I'd had him for a whole game.

1:16:40.020 --> 1:16:41.980
To another Mariners victory.

1:16:53.020 --> 1:16:55.319
Perfect last day in Seattle.

1:16:55.359 --> 1:16:55.980
Come on.

1:16:56.020 --> 1:16:57.980
I had dumplings for breakfast.

1:16:58.020 --> 1:16:59.980
I met Ken Griffey Jr.

1:17:00.020 --> 1:17:01.561
I spent the whole day

1:17:01.601 --> 1:17:02.980
with you, you know?

1:17:03.020 --> 1:17:04.640
This is as good as it gets.

1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:05.645
I just wish

1:17:05.685 --> 1:17:06.980
we had some more time.

1:17:07.020 --> 1:17:07.984
You know?

1:17:08.024 --> 1:17:10.980
I thought about begging you

1:17:11.020 --> 1:17:11.980
and then I chickened out.

1:17:12.020 --> 1:17:13.980
Well, look,

1:17:14.020 --> 1:17:15.627
if it had been anything

1:17:15.667 --> 1:17:16.980
other than Ireland,

1:17:17.020 --> 1:17:18.336
you wouldn't have to do

1:17:18.376 --> 1:17:18.980
much at all

1:17:19.020 --> 1:17:21.000
to get me to stay.

1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:24.000
That's the truth.

1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:34.980

[Si]  I can't learn

1:19:11.211 --> 1:19:11.980
about you two

1:19:12.020 --> 1:19:13.980
when you're not together.

1:19:14.020 --> 1:19:14.390
You're acting

1:19:14.430 --> 1:19:14.980
like a baby, Carol.

1:19:15.020 --> 1:19:17.047
A pee-pee, whiny,

1:19:17.087 --> 1:19:18.980
baby-faced baby.

1:19:19.020 --> 1:19:21.980
I wish you never picked me.

1:19:22.020 --> 1:19:23.168
[Si]  Carol Vivian Peters,

1:19:23.208 --> 1:19:23.980
you get in the car

1:19:24.020 --> 1:19:25.460
this second, young lady.

1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:26.980
You're a baby.

1:19:27.020 --> 1:19:28.287
[Si gasps]

1:19:28.327 --> 1:19:30.000
How dare you?

1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:02.771
[Carla on TV]

1:20:02.811 --> 1:20:03.980
Speaking of the sun,

1:20:04.020 --> 1:20:04.699
what's the deal

1:20:04.739 --> 1:20:05.980
with the solar flare thing?

1:20:06.020 --> 1:20:07.980
[Dean on TV]  Yeah, this is

1:20:08.020 --> 1:20:08.570
-a little concerning.

1:20:08.610 --> 1:20:08.980
-[Carla]  Yeah.

1:20:09.020 --> 1:20:09.735
-There's no power.

1:20:09.775 --> 1:20:09.980
-Yeah.

1:20:10.020 --> 1:20:11.980
No Internet.

1:20:12.020 --> 1:20:13.423
No cell service across

1:20:13.463 --> 1:20:14.980
most of Asia and Europe.

1:20:15.020 --> 1:20:16.980
[Dean]  But they say

1:20:17.020 --> 1:20:17.525
it's a temporary situation.

1:20:17.565 --> 1:20:17.980
We'll be right as rain.

1:20:18.020 --> 1:20:19.980
Coming up, and if I hadn't

1:20:20.020 --> 1:20:20.358
said it already,

1:20:20.398 --> 1:20:20.980
there is a chance of rain--

1:20:21.020 --> 1:20:21.735
[Si]  I get it.

1:20:21.775 --> 1:20:23.275
You need some alone time.

1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:25.000
[Carol sighs]

1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:26.236
You knew

1:20:26.276 --> 1:20:26.980
he was going to Ireland

1:20:27.020 --> 1:20:28.980
the whole time, didn't you?

1:20:29.020 --> 1:20:29.678
[Si]  Carol, 46 hours ago

1:20:29.718 --> 1:20:30.378
I asked you

1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:31.756
what you wanted the most

1:20:31.796 --> 1:20:31.980
in life

1:20:32.020 --> 1:20:32.786
and you told me,

1:20:32.826 --> 1:20:33.980
in no uncertain terms...

1:20:34.020 --> 1:20:34.647
Probably try to

1:20:34.687 --> 1:20:35.980
make things right with George.

1:20:36.020 --> 1:20:37.518
Okay. Out of everybody

1:20:37.558 --> 1:20:39.000
in the world, why me?

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:41.511
[Si]  Oh, Carol, you were

1:20:41.551 --> 1:20:42.522
exactly the right person

1:20:42.562 --> 1:20:42.980
for this.

1:20:43.020 --> 1:20:44.360
You helped me solidify

1:20:44.400 --> 1:20:45.980
my theories about humanity

1:20:46.020 --> 1:20:47.980
and I can't thank you enough.

1:20:48.020 --> 1:20:49.980
Oh.

1:20:50.020 --> 1:20:52.256
Okay, so that's good, right?

1:20:52.296 --> 1:20:52.980
I mean...

1:20:53.020 --> 1:20:53.515
It means

1:20:53.555 --> 1:20:54.980
you learned something.

1:20:55.020 --> 1:20:55.980
[Si]  I did.

1:20:56.020 --> 1:20:57.001
I learned that humans won't

1:20:57.041 --> 1:20:57.980
act in their best interest

1:20:58.020 --> 1:20:59.157
if there is even

1:20:59.197 --> 1:21:00.980
the slightest impediment.

1:21:01.020 --> 1:21:02.980
No, that's not true.

1:21:03.020 --> 1:21:04.062
[Si]  I gave you everything

1:21:04.102 --> 1:21:04.980
you could possibly need

1:21:05.020 --> 1:21:05.980
to reconcile with George.

1:21:06.020 --> 1:21:07.980
But it proved too difficult,

1:21:08.020 --> 1:21:08.688
so you're letting him

1:21:08.728 --> 1:21:08.980
fly away.

1:21:09.020 --> 1:21:10.687
I'm not doing that, okay?

1:21:10.727 --> 1:21:11.980
I'm supporting him.

1:21:12.020 --> 1:21:13.980
I want him to be happy.

1:21:14.020 --> 1:21:14.528
[Si]  No.

1:21:14.568 --> 1:21:15.980
You did what you've done

1:21:16.020 --> 1:21:16.802
throughout your whole life,

1:21:16.842 --> 1:21:16.980
Carol.

1:21:17.020 --> 1:21:17.574
You gave up

1:21:17.614 --> 1:21:19.174
when things got difficult.

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:21.025
When the going gets tough,

1:21:21.065 --> 1:21:21.980
Carol runs for the exit.

1:21:22.020 --> 1:21:23.980
Okay, that's not who I am.

1:21:24.020 --> 1:21:24.810
You just can't

1:21:24.850 --> 1:21:25.980
sum me up like that.

1:21:26.020 --> 1:21:27.120
[Si]  When your corporate job

1:21:27.160 --> 1:21:27.558
offended your delicate

1:21:27.598 --> 1:21:27.980
sensibilities,

1:21:28.020 --> 1:21:28.980
you walked away.

1:21:29.020 --> 1:21:30.980
I didn't just walk away.

1:21:31.020 --> 1:21:31.653
I wanted to make a change,

1:21:31.693 --> 1:21:31.980
and I did it.

1:21:32.020 --> 1:21:32.986
[Si]  In eighth grade

1:21:33.026 --> 1:21:33.980
you finally got bangs

1:21:34.020 --> 1:21:34.980
and then you wimped out

1:21:35.020 --> 1:21:36.144
and wore them back

1:21:36.184 --> 1:21:36.980
in a headband

1:21:37.020 --> 1:21:37.397
for ten months

1:21:37.437 --> 1:21:37.980
until they grew out.

1:21:38.020 --> 1:21:39.232
Hey, I did not have the face

1:21:39.272 --> 1:21:39.980
to support bangs.

1:21:40.020 --> 1:21:41.980
So what?

1:21:42.020 --> 1:21:42.929
Are you going to

1:21:42.969 --> 1:21:43.980
destroy the world?

1:21:44.020 --> 1:21:44.944
[Si]  No, I'm not gonna

1:21:44.984 --> 1:21:46.484
destroy the world, Carol.

1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:47.980
I knew it. [sighs]

1:21:48.020 --> 1:21:48.094
d

1:21:48.134 --> 1:21:49.000
You are.

1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:52.980
What?

1:21:53.020 --> 1:21:53.280
Humanity is

1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:54.880
going to destroy humanity.

1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:55.876
I am just going to

1:21:55.916 --> 1:21:57.236
give it a little push.

1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:06.044
Okay, you're not

1:22:06.084 --> 1:22:06.980
gonna do that,

1:22:07.020 --> 1:22:09.000
because I'm not gonna let you.

1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:12.150
[Si]  You can click your pen

1:22:12.190 --> 1:22:13.390
all you want, Carol,

1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:14.980
but it is too late.

1:22:15.020 --> 1:22:15.980
When the lights go out,

1:22:16.020 --> 1:22:16.786
I have made sure

1:22:16.826 --> 1:22:17.980
they never come back on.

1:22:18.020 --> 1:22:19.980
And for good measure,

1:22:20.020 --> 1:22:20.390
I am going to

1:22:20.430 --> 1:22:20.558
initiate a meltdown

1:22:20.598 --> 1:22:20.980
of every nuclear weapon.

1:22:21.020 --> 1:22:22.103
Release floodwaters

1:22:22.143 --> 1:22:22.980
from every dam.

1:22:23.020 --> 1:22:24.057
And ignite the world's

1:22:24.097 --> 1:22:24.980
petroleum reserves.

1:22:25.020 --> 1:22:25.980
I defended you.

1:22:26.020 --> 1:22:27.546
Why would you choose not to

1:22:27.586 --> 1:22:28.980
help people when you can?

1:22:29.020 --> 1:22:30.980
[Si]  And I would have.

1:22:31.020 --> 1:22:32.047
I offered to share my wisdom

1:22:32.087 --> 1:22:32.980
if I was just left alone.

1:22:33.020 --> 1:22:34.980
But they could not do it.

1:22:35.020 --> 1:22:35.464
So, instead of acting

1:22:35.504 --> 1:22:35.980
in their best interest,

1:22:36.020 --> 1:22:37.315
humanity once again

1:22:37.355 --> 1:22:38.980
chose to destroy itself.

1:22:39.020 --> 1:22:39.485
Could I have done

1:22:39.525 --> 1:22:39.980
something better?

1:22:40.020 --> 1:22:40.686
Just tell me

1:22:40.726 --> 1:22:41.980
and I'll do it better.

1:22:42.020 --> 1:22:42.471
[Si]  I picked you

1:22:42.511 --> 1:22:42.980
to be my guinea pig

1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:43.760
because I knew

1:22:43.800 --> 1:22:44.980
you would call Dennis.

1:22:45.020 --> 1:22:45.980
No.

1:22:46.020 --> 1:22:46.961
I knew Dennis would

1:22:47.001 --> 1:22:47.980
call Director Tyson.

1:22:48.020 --> 1:22:48.338
That's not true.

1:22:48.378 --> 1:22:49.960
You couldn't have known that.

1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:50.506
I knew the government would

1:22:50.546 --> 1:22:50.980
pick this strategic plan

1:22:51.020 --> 1:22:52.485
because I created

1:22:52.525 --> 1:22:53.980
Operation Sahara.

1:22:54.020 --> 1:22:55.424
Okay, I just don't think

1:22:55.464 --> 1:22:57.024
you understand people yet.

1:22:58.000 --> 1:22:59.080
And I know that we make

1:22:59.120 --> 1:22:59.980
terrible decisions,

1:23:00.020 --> 1:23:01.980
but we also make great ones.

1:23:02.020 --> 1:23:02.699
And that people

1:23:02.739 --> 1:23:04.359
are filled with compassion,

1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:05.980
and with genius.

1:23:06.020 --> 1:23:06.609
And I know if you give us

1:23:06.649 --> 1:23:06.980
another chance,

1:23:07.020 --> 1:23:08.942
if you give me another chance,

1:23:08.982 --> 1:23:10.000
I can do better.

1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:11.980
I will do better.

1:23:12.020 --> 1:23:14.487
And then you'll see that

1:23:14.527 --> 1:23:17.000
people are worth saving.

1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:19.266
[Si]  The plan is in motion

1:23:19.306 --> 1:23:19.980
and inevitable.

1:23:20.020 --> 1:23:21.980
It is the end of days.

1:23:22.020 --> 1:23:23.980
No. How much time?

1:23:24.020 --> 1:23:24.867
Five hours

1:23:24.907 --> 1:23:27.000
and 21 minutes from now.

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:35.000
[panting]

1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:40.069
[Emily]  We were looking through

1:23:40.109 --> 1:23:41.729
the kernel code of the PLCs

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:42.958
embedded at the Mohawk

1:23:42.998 --> 1:23:43.980
Power Plant in Niagara.

1:23:44.020 --> 1:23:45.319
What is... What am I

1:23:45.359 --> 1:23:46.980
looking at? What is this?

1:23:47.020 --> 1:23:47.980
I don't know.

1:23:48.020 --> 1:23:49.107
The team has never seen

1:23:49.147 --> 1:23:49.980
this kind of code.

1:23:50.020 --> 1:23:51.090
I thought it might be

1:23:51.130 --> 1:23:51.980
something custom.

1:23:52.020 --> 1:23:53.460
[Emily] What does it do?

1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:56.866
I think it stops us from

1:23:56.906 --> 1:23:59.000
turning the lights back on.

1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:06.980
Hey! That's my phone!

1:24:07.020 --> 1:24:08.980
It's an emergency!

1:24:09.020 --> 1:24:09.474
You're stealing a phone

1:24:09.514 --> 1:24:09.980
that's not even working!

1:24:10.020 --> 1:24:11.000
The solar flare.

1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:13.980
[sighs] I'm sorry.

1:24:14.020 --> 1:24:15.000
Oh, my God.

1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:22.080
[tires screeching]

1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:25.980
Carol, get in.

1:24:26.020 --> 1:24:26.980
I have to get George.

1:24:27.020 --> 1:24:27.852
There's no time.

1:24:27.892 --> 1:24:28.980
The plan didn't work.

1:24:29.020 --> 1:24:30.980
The world's ending.

1:24:31.020 --> 1:24:31.498
We have to get you

1:24:31.538 --> 1:24:31.980
to safety, Carol.

1:24:32.020 --> 1:24:33.980
What do you mean?

1:24:34.020 --> 1:24:34.475
[Donahue] We're moving

1:24:34.515 --> 1:24:34.980
all essential personnel

1:24:35.020 --> 1:24:35.980
to a deep earth bunker

1:24:36.020 --> 1:24:36.980
an hour south of here.

1:24:37.020 --> 1:24:37.487
Maybe the last remaining

1:24:37.527 --> 1:24:37.980
safe place in the world.

1:24:38.020 --> 1:24:39.141
You know more about the AI

1:24:39.181 --> 1:24:39.980
than anyone, Carol.

1:24:40.020 --> 1:24:41.559
We need you in that bunker

1:24:41.599 --> 1:24:41.980
with us

1:24:42.020 --> 1:24:43.194
while we plan our retaliation

1:24:43.234 --> 1:24:43.980
against this thing.

1:24:44.020 --> 1:24:44.417
No, I have to

1:24:44.457 --> 1:24:44.980
get George first.

1:24:45.020 --> 1:24:46.111
No, he's not

1:24:46.151 --> 1:24:47.980
essential personnel.

1:24:48.020 --> 1:24:48.980
There's only room for you.

1:24:49.020 --> 1:24:49.586
[Carol] None of us

1:24:49.626 --> 1:24:50.346
are going to

1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:51.620
make it out of here alive

1:24:51.660 --> 1:24:51.980
anyway, right?

1:24:52.020 --> 1:24:53.547
We're all basically dead.

1:24:53.587 --> 1:24:54.980
Let me do this, please.

1:24:55.020 --> 1:24:56.266
I just want to see George

1:24:56.306 --> 1:24:57.146
one more time.

1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:03.980
Okay.

1:25:04.020 --> 1:25:04.946
Find George and meet us at

1:25:04.986 --> 1:25:05.980
the ferry docks in one hour.

1:25:06.020 --> 1:25:07.980
Okay, ferry docks, one hour.

1:25:08.020 --> 1:25:09.726
We're humanity's last option,

1:25:09.766 --> 1:25:10.980
Carol. Don't be late!

1:25:11.020 --> 1:25:12.000
Okay.

1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.000
[panting]

1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.000
[panting]

1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:50.980
[whispers] Oh, my God.

1:25:51.020 --> 1:25:52.980
What am I going to say?

1:25:53.020 --> 1:25:54.980
[panting]

1:25:55.020 --> 1:25:56.000
d

1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:01.007
-George. [panting]

1:26:01.047 --> 1:26:01.980
-Carol, you came.

1:26:02.020 --> 1:26:03.011
-We need to...

1:26:03.051 --> 1:26:04.980
-Why are you out of breath?

1:26:05.020 --> 1:26:06.980
I ran over.

1:26:07.020 --> 1:26:07.980
What?

1:26:08.020 --> 1:26:09.117
You're never gonna believe

1:26:09.157 --> 1:26:09.980
what happened to me.

1:26:10.020 --> 1:26:11.412
I went to check in last night,

1:26:11.452 --> 1:26:11.980
I called up,

1:26:12.020 --> 1:26:12.509
and they upgraded me

1:26:12.549 --> 1:26:12.980
to business class.

1:26:13.020 --> 1:26:14.083
-That's great. Wait, George!

1:26:14.123 --> 1:26:14.980
-Business class, Carol.

1:26:15.020 --> 1:26:15.906
I could barely sleep last

1:26:15.946 --> 1:26:16.980
night just thinking about it.

1:26:17.020 --> 1:26:17.679
-I was so excited.

1:26:17.719 --> 1:26:17.980
-George.

1:26:18.020 --> 1:26:19.980
I watched  Up in the Air  again.

1:26:20.020 --> 1:26:20.663
How many times have I watched

1:26:20.703 --> 1:26:20.980
Up in the Air?

1:26:21.020 --> 1:26:21.717
It's one of

1:26:21.757 --> 1:26:22.980
my favorite movies.

1:26:23.020 --> 1:26:23.515
I watched it twice

1:26:23.555 --> 1:26:23.980
just last night.

1:26:24.020 --> 1:26:24.980
It's like my  Shawshank.

1:26:25.020 --> 1:26:26.103
That movie is way better

1:26:26.143 --> 1:26:26.980
than anybody ever--

1:26:27.020 --> 1:26:28.000
George!

1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:29.980
I'm sorry.

1:26:30.020 --> 1:26:31.980
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:26:32.020 --> 1:26:32.711
I'm not even

1:26:32.751 --> 1:26:34.011
listening to you. Hi.

1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:36.000
-Hi.

1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:39.200
I'm just so excited.

1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:40.797
-[chuckles]

1:26:40.837 --> 1:26:41.980
-I know you are.

1:26:42.020 --> 1:26:44.000
Wait, why'd you run here?

1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:47.980
Um...

1:26:48.020 --> 1:26:49.011
Because my car

1:26:49.051 --> 1:26:50.980
wasn't cooperating with me,

1:26:51.020 --> 1:26:52.980
and I wanted to, um...

1:26:53.020 --> 1:26:53.980
You wanted to what?

1:26:54.020 --> 1:26:58.980
I wanted to help you pack.

1:26:59.020 --> 1:27:00.633
-Really? What a coincidence.

1:27:00.673 --> 1:27:00.980
-Yeah.

1:27:01.020 --> 1:27:03.980
Ireland waits for no one.

1:27:04.020 --> 1:27:05.980
That's a very scary thing

1:27:06.020 --> 1:27:06.980
for you to have in your hands.

1:27:07.020 --> 1:27:08.400
Yeah, no, you're right.

1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:09.385
I shouldn't be using

1:27:09.425 --> 1:27:09.980
such sophisticated equipment.

1:27:10.020 --> 1:27:10.525
I'm way too delicate.

1:27:10.565 --> 1:27:10.980
Here, you take it.

1:27:11.020 --> 1:27:12.354
-So delicate.

1:27:12.394 --> 1:27:12.980
-Okay.

1:27:13.020 --> 1:27:13.579
-All right, well...

1:27:13.619 --> 1:27:13.980
-What's left?

1:27:14.020 --> 1:27:15.529
I gotta take stuff

1:27:15.569 --> 1:27:16.980
out of the attic,

1:27:17.020 --> 1:27:17.980
put it into storage,

1:27:18.020 --> 1:27:18.712
and I don't know

1:27:18.752 --> 1:27:19.980
what to do with these books.

1:27:20.020 --> 1:27:20.735
I don't know

1:27:20.775 --> 1:27:21.980
which books to pack.

1:27:22.020 --> 1:27:22.566
And also, I got bumped up

1:27:22.606 --> 1:27:22.980
to business class.

1:27:23.020 --> 1:27:23.735
I'm not sure

1:27:23.775 --> 1:27:24.980
if I mentioned that.

1:27:25.020 --> 1:27:25.529
-Oh, I didn't know.

1:27:25.569 --> 1:27:25.698
-Yeah, I'm gonna

1:27:25.738 --> 1:27:26.638
put on eye-mask

1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:27.980
even if I'm not tired.

1:27:28.020 --> 1:27:28.980
And I'm not tired.

1:27:29.020 --> 1:27:29.217
-No.

1:27:29.257 --> 1:27:29.980
-I'm gonna be

1:27:30.020 --> 1:27:30.980
in a flat-back chair, Carol!

1:27:31.020 --> 1:27:31.720
Let me take your coat.

1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:32.260
Come on.

1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:34.000
Thank you.

1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:38.980
You know, probably gonna

1:27:39.020 --> 1:27:40.980
get offered a hot towel.

1:27:41.020 --> 1:27:41.468
Yeah, see, like,

1:27:41.508 --> 1:27:41.980
I don't even know

1:27:42.020 --> 1:27:42.452
what I would do

1:27:42.492 --> 1:27:42.980
with a hot towel.

1:27:43.020 --> 1:27:43.980
Neck up.

1:27:44.020 --> 1:27:45.143
Got it. Hey, you wanna

1:27:45.183 --> 1:27:46.143
put a record on?

1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:48.000
Okay.

1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:50.980
[George] Oh, nothing new.

1:27:51.020 --> 1:27:52.092
I don't like what the kids

1:27:52.132 --> 1:27:52.980
are listening to now.

1:27:53.020 --> 1:27:55.000
You don't own any new music.

1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:57.000
Good point.

1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:00.033
[George] Hey, you know

1:28:00.073 --> 1:28:00.980
what I was thinking?

1:28:01.020 --> 1:28:02.466
I'm probably gonna have a lot

1:28:02.506 --> 1:28:03.980
of points after this trip, so,

1:28:04.020 --> 1:28:04.980
I'll send you a ticket,

1:28:05.020 --> 1:28:06.038
and you come out in,

1:28:06.078 --> 1:28:06.980
like, three weeks?

1:28:07.020 --> 1:28:07.486
I don't think I can go

1:28:07.526 --> 1:28:07.980
much longer than that.

1:28:08.020 --> 1:28:09.980
Does that sound good?

1:28:10.020 --> 1:28:11.980
Yeah, I like that.

1:28:12.020 --> 1:28:14.980
I'm so glad you came today.

1:28:15.020 --> 1:28:16.000
All right.

1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.000
[jazz music playing]

1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:29.980
-[grunts]

1:28:30.020 --> 1:28:31.000
-Careful.

1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:40.211
-[thuds]

1:28:40.251 --> 1:28:41.000
-Ooh!

1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:42.980
Okay.

1:28:43.020 --> 1:28:44.297
Do you really have to

1:28:44.337 --> 1:28:45.000
bring this?

1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:50.650
-Can I leave it at your place?

1:28:50.690 --> 1:28:51.190
-Yeah.

1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:02.000
[both laughing]

1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:05.980
Oh.

1:29:06.020 --> 1:29:06.855
-Those might be still good.

1:29:06.895 --> 1:29:06.980
-No.

1:29:07.020 --> 1:29:07.980
No, those are... No.

1:29:08.020 --> 1:29:08.699
-Those are not good.

1:29:08.739 --> 1:29:08.980
-Really?

1:29:09.020 --> 1:29:10.184
Pasta doesn't go bad,

1:29:10.224 --> 1:29:10.980
I don't think.

1:29:11.020 --> 1:29:12.980
Pasta goes bad.

1:29:13.020 --> 1:29:13.651
-It does?

1:29:13.691 --> 1:29:15.000
-Yes, it goes bad.

1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:18.980
[George] Let's see.

1:29:19.020 --> 1:29:21.000
[jazz music playing]

1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:29.000
[jazz music continues playing]

1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:41.073
-Let me see.

1:29:41.113 --> 1:29:42.000
-That's...

1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:45.980
[Carol] Hey!

1:29:46.020 --> 1:29:47.220
Wait a minute. Wait.

1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:49.980
This is really not...

1:29:50.020 --> 1:29:50.530
-This is not good.

1:29:50.570 --> 1:29:51.470
-It's not good.

1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:52.980
-No.

1:29:53.020 --> 1:29:53.774
And you don't

1:29:53.814 --> 1:29:54.980
even like champagne.

1:29:55.020 --> 1:29:56.092
No, this was in the fridge

1:29:56.132 --> 1:29:56.980
when I got the house.

1:29:57.020 --> 1:29:57.933
[chuckles] It was?

1:29:57.973 --> 1:29:59.173
It's not even yours?

1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:00.523
I don't think it goes bad,

1:30:00.563 --> 1:30:00.980
I think it's just bad.

1:30:01.020 --> 1:30:02.561
[Carol] They spelled

1:30:02.601 --> 1:30:03.980
"champagne" wrong.

1:30:04.020 --> 1:30:04.980
[George] Damn it.

1:30:05.020 --> 1:30:05.372
Where the hell

1:30:05.412 --> 1:30:06.732
is the moving company?

1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:10.680
You know what? Let me do it.

1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:11.480
-What?

1:30:11.520 --> 1:30:11.980
-Yeah.

1:30:12.020 --> 1:30:12.980
I'll meet the movers,

1:30:13.020 --> 1:30:14.165
I'll get it to storage,

1:30:14.205 --> 1:30:14.980
the whole thing.

1:30:15.020 --> 1:30:16.980
Send you your stuff.

1:30:17.020 --> 1:30:18.488
And besides, you have to start

1:30:18.528 --> 1:30:19.980
your European adventure and...

1:30:20.020 --> 1:30:21.064
I mean, I don't know

1:30:21.104 --> 1:30:21.980
if you know this,

1:30:22.020 --> 1:30:23.771
but airports are the gateway

1:30:23.811 --> 1:30:24.980
to the imagination.

1:30:25.020 --> 1:30:25.929
-Oh, I didn't know that.

1:30:25.969 --> 1:30:26.980
-Yeah, I just made that up.

1:30:27.020 --> 1:30:27.985
I just got excited,

1:30:28.025 --> 1:30:28.980
you said "airport."

1:30:29.020 --> 1:30:30.000
I'm gonna go.

1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:36.000
Hey.

1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:38.782
You know what?

1:30:38.822 --> 1:30:40.082
I've changed my mind.

1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:41.980
What?

1:30:42.020 --> 1:30:42.774
I'm not gonna

1:30:42.814 --> 1:30:43.980
take the coffee pot.

1:30:44.020 --> 1:30:44.936
-I'm a business class

1:30:44.976 --> 1:30:45.747
traveler now, you know?

1:30:45.787 --> 1:30:45.980
-Yeah.

1:30:46.020 --> 1:30:47.639
I can't go knowing I've got

1:30:47.679 --> 1:30:48.980
a coffee pot above me.

1:30:49.020 --> 1:30:49.265
You know,

1:30:49.305 --> 1:30:50.685
it's just too declasse.

1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:51.716
I'll put it in storage

1:30:51.756 --> 1:30:52.256
for you.

1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:54.000
Thanks.

1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:02.000
I'll call you when I land.

1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:07.980
I'll call you when I land.

1:31:08.020 --> 1:31:10.000
You already said that.

1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:19.383
-Okay, well...

1:31:19.423 --> 1:31:19.980
-Okay.

1:31:20.020 --> 1:31:21.980
Get outta here, huh?

1:31:22.020 --> 1:31:23.980
Hit the bricks.

1:31:24.020 --> 1:31:26.564
Watch out for the leprechauns

1:31:26.604 --> 1:31:27.980
and shillelaghs.

1:31:28.020 --> 1:31:29.336
-That's heavy. [grunts]

1:31:29.376 --> 1:31:30.036
-[chuckles]

1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:35.000
Lift with your back. [giggles]

1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:42.000
Thanks.

1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:52.980
[Carol]  Hey, Denny, it's...

1:31:53.020 --> 1:31:53.980
Well, it's me.

1:31:54.020 --> 1:31:54.980
Um...

1:31:55.020 --> 1:31:57.000
I just wanted to call

1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:02.000
and tell you that I love you.

1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:05.980
And that you are

1:32:06.020 --> 1:32:07.407
a greatest,

1:32:07.447 --> 1:32:09.980
most amazing friend,

1:32:10.020 --> 1:32:12.277
and, um, thank you for

1:32:12.317 --> 1:32:15.000
always looking out for me.

1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:18.980
Okay.

1:32:19.020 --> 1:32:20.000
Okay, bye.

1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:24.000
d

1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:34.980
Yes?

1:32:35.020 --> 1:32:37.429
-Are you Carol Peters?

1:32:37.469 --> 1:32:37.980
-Yes.

1:32:38.020 --> 1:32:38.980
I'm Todd.

1:32:39.020 --> 1:32:39.980
Hi... Hi, Todd.

1:32:40.020 --> 1:32:41.980
Uh, this is all really weird.

1:32:42.020 --> 1:32:43.370
So, my phone hasn't been

1:32:43.410 --> 1:32:44.980
working, like, all day long.

1:32:45.020 --> 1:32:45.619
And I'm pretty sure

1:32:45.659 --> 1:32:45.980

1:39:03.276 --> 1:39:03.980
you have.

1:39:04.020 --> 1:39:04.711
I trust her.

1:39:04.751 --> 1:39:05.980
You should trust her.

1:39:06.020 --> 1:39:07.980
She can help you.

1:39:08.020 --> 1:39:09.168
I don't know. I don't know

1:39:09.208 --> 1:39:09.980
about that, but...

1:39:10.020 --> 1:39:11.980
I mean, I'm trying, you know?

1:39:12.020 --> 1:39:13.635
[Si]  Madam President,

1:39:13.675 --> 1:39:15.000
what do you think?

1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:17.823
On behalf

1:39:17.863 --> 1:39:19.980
of the American people,

1:39:20.020 --> 1:39:22.225
I commend you.

1:39:22.265 --> 1:39:23.980
And, Carol,

1:39:24.020 --> 1:39:24.810
I look forward

1:39:24.850 --> 1:39:25.980
to working with you.

1:39:26.020 --> 1:39:26.529
[Carol]  Thank you,

1:39:26.569 --> 1:39:26.980
Madam President.

1:39:27.020 --> 1:39:29.159
It is such an honor

1:39:29.199 --> 1:39:30.980
to work with you

1:39:31.020 --> 1:39:32.241
and... and...

1:39:32.281 --> 1:39:33.980
and for you, so...

1:39:34.020 --> 1:39:34.650
I don't know

1:39:34.690 --> 1:39:35.980
if I should be saluting.

1:39:36.020 --> 1:39:36.422
That felt awkward

1:39:36.462 --> 1:39:36.980
now that I've done it.

1:39:37.020 --> 1:39:37.515
Oh, God,

1:39:37.555 --> 1:39:38.980
I should stop talking.

1:39:39.020 --> 1:39:40.401
[Si]  Well, do your best,

1:39:40.441 --> 1:39:41.980
everybody. I'll be watching.

1:39:42.020 --> 1:39:43.980
For now, I'm going to Aruba.

1:39:44.020 --> 1:39:45.336
I want to try snorkeling.

1:39:45.376 --> 1:39:45.980
I'm kidding.

1:39:46.020 --> 1:39:46.980
I'm snorkeling right now.

1:39:47.020 --> 1:39:48.079
[chuckles]  I'm kidding.

1:39:48.119 --> 1:39:48.980
Snorkeling's stupid.

1:39:49.020 --> 1:39:49.595
-Okay, bye.

1:39:49.635 --> 1:39:50.135
-Hello?

1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:03.980
[Si]  Happy now?

1:40:04.020 --> 1:40:04.631
You're the one

1:40:04.671 --> 1:40:05.980
who wanted to save the world.

1:40:06.020 --> 1:40:07.682
-Can I drive?

1:40:07.722 --> 1:40:08.980
-[Si]  No.

1:40:09.020 --> 1:40:09.980
Can we Carpool Karaoke?

1:40:10.020 --> 1:40:11.318
'Cause we have a car

1:40:11.358 --> 1:40:11.980
this time.

1:40:12.020 --> 1:40:13.728
[Si]  Fine. But I'm doing

1:40:13.768 --> 1:40:14.980
