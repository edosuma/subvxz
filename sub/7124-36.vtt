00:41.515 --> 00:42.950
I'm home!

00:57.415 --> 01:00.361
<i>Who's</i> gonna have
dinner with me tonight?

01:05.955 --> 01:06.977
Sorry, fellas.

01:07.080 --> 01:10.614
I got to go make
some dreams come true.

01:12.180 --> 01:14.581
Where are we headed,
dream token?

01:19.384 --> 01:20.767
Aha!

01:21.851 --> 01:24.253
Aw, Finn again.

01:36.436 --> 01:38.697
Say "cheese!"

01:38.955 --> 01:40.355
Cheese!

01:42.637 --> 01:45.605
"Eybdoog" yas

01:45.746 --> 01:46.973
Hello!

01:47.183 --> 01:50.277
Huh? Wait, wait!

01:54.875 --> 01:56.989
Who's that?

02:01.285 --> 02:03.567
She's so beautiful!

02:09.507 --> 02:10.621
Butt feathers!

02:10.691 --> 02:11.746
Huh?

02:11.848 --> 02:13.629
Whoa, the cosmic owl?!

02:14.011 --> 02:15.646
Does that mean this
dream is important?!

02:15.713 --> 02:16.988
Is this a
prophetic dream?!

02:17.098 --> 02:19.418
And is this stuff all
symbolic or literal?

02:19.486 --> 02:20.487
Huh?

02:20.564 --> 02:22.386
Oh, yeah, sort of.

02:22.463 --> 02:23.624
Wait.

02:24.390 --> 02:25.622
What does
it all mean, boy?

02:25.699 --> 02:27.397
Dang, she's gone!

02:27.499 --> 02:29.571
What? W-w-what
are you asking me?

02:29.639 --> 02:31.499
Uh, I can't tell you that.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.241
I don't know, shelby.

02:35.311 --> 02:36.632
I think it's
too dark in there.

02:36.710 --> 02:37.792
Aah!

02:37.869 --> 02:39.351
Pull him up,
pull him up!

02:41.899 --> 02:44.054
Think I just had
a prophetic dream.

02:44.171 --> 02:45.409
Cosmic owl was in it.

02:45.477 --> 02:47.421
He was acting
all choco-loco.

02:47.555 --> 02:49.835
Finn, you got
to go back to sleep.

02:49.936 --> 02:50.937
Huh?

02:51.012 --> 02:53.457
Cosmic owl dreams
are important always!

02:53.527 --> 02:54.870
You got to find him again!

02:54.938 --> 02:55.986
Yeah, but last time I

02:56.063 --> 02:57.754
chased a cosmic owl dream,
I got dumped.

02:57.831 --> 02:59.389
Shh!
Get back in there!

02:59.466 --> 03:00.624
It's too important.

03:00.726 --> 03:02.793
You don't got time to
waste on my class ring

03:02.870 --> 03:04.862
or bets with shelby
or stomach fishing.

03:04.939 --> 03:06.017
Oop!

03:06.085 --> 03:07.290
<i>WHAT?</i>

03:07.358 --> 03:09.069
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh!

03:12.099 --> 03:14.034
All right, let's do it.

03:17.475 --> 03:19.130
Hey, cosmic owl!

03:19.198 --> 03:20.952
You still here? Oh!

03:27.734 --> 03:29.492
Butt feathers...

03:33.102 --> 03:35.052
Love is weird, man.

03:35.320 --> 03:38.961
It really does come when
you least expect it.

03:40.281 --> 03:42.695
Dude, you've been working on
that since you got here.

03:42.763 --> 03:43.867
Take a break.

03:43.935 --> 03:46.328
You haven't even asked me
about my banjo lessons.

03:46.525 --> 03:47.836
They're going great!

03:48.970 --> 03:50.078
Dude?

03:50.219 --> 03:53.305
Sorry, I just can't stop
thinking about her.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.961
You really are in love, huh?

03:56.123 --> 03:58.673
All right, tell me
more about her.

03:58.750 --> 04:00.050
Where'd you meet?

04:00.180 --> 04:01.476
In a dream.

04:01.553 --> 04:03.010
What?! Whose?!

04:03.087 --> 04:04.328
Finn the human.

04:04.396 --> 04:05.880
What?! Who's that?!

04:05.964 --> 04:07.722
No, wait,
I know that guy.

04:07.844 --> 04:10.752
Look, I don't think you were put
in charge of prophetic dreams

04:10.820 --> 04:12.062
so you could meet ladies.

04:12.139 --> 04:13.554
Who cares?

04:13.638 --> 04:14.922
I'm in love!

04:14.990 --> 04:16.827
What am I even
worried about?

04:16.961 --> 04:18.678
How will you ever
even find her again?

04:18.747 --> 04:21.247
Do you have any idea how many
people are dreaming every night?

04:21.315 --> 04:22.830
Yes, I <i> do.</i>

04:22.969 --> 04:25.117
Dude, it could take
you a million years.

04:25.211 --> 04:26.789
Then it would
be worth it...

04:26.880 --> 04:28.421
For love!

04:31.972 --> 04:33.937
Forgot my sketchbook.

05:01.485 --> 05:03.601
It's gonna be a long night.

05:25.918 --> 05:27.481
Uh...

05:43.655 --> 05:44.990
Hmm?

06:00.455 --> 06:01.549
Excuse me?

06:01.675 --> 06:02.863
Are these weenies?

06:02.940 --> 06:04.378
Shrimp puffs, monsieur.

06:04.507 --> 06:06.089
Oh.

06:07.745 --> 06:09.011
Uh, hi.

06:09.088 --> 06:11.058
Oh. Is that a weenie?

06:11.183 --> 06:12.456
It's a shrimp puff.

06:12.524 --> 06:14.158
Oh, I love shrimps puffs!

06:14.277 --> 06:15.310
Here.

06:15.378 --> 06:17.363
This is a dream come true.

06:20.355 --> 06:21.560
Do I know you?

06:21.628 --> 06:22.745
I'm crashing.

06:22.831 --> 06:23.903
Oh.

06:23.979 --> 06:26.614
I saw you in a dream,
and I had to see you again,

06:26.777 --> 06:29.019
even though just by
me being here,

06:29.159 --> 06:31.527
events in this dream
will come true.

06:31.595 --> 06:32.929
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

06:33.068 --> 06:34.269
Agh!

06:35.241 --> 06:38.073
Oh, geez,
that poor guy.

06:38.277 --> 06:39.567
- Whose dream?
- Hmm?

06:39.683 --> 06:41.646
Whose dream did
you see me in?

06:41.714 --> 06:44.378
- Oh, uh, Finn the human.
- Hmm.

06:44.558 --> 06:45.949
I shouldn't be here.

06:46.026 --> 06:48.589
No, you intrigue me.

06:48.738 --> 06:50.456
So powerful.

06:50.684 --> 06:52.776
W-what's happening?

06:52.915 --> 06:54.015
You're waking up.

06:54.101 --> 06:55.123
Oh, no!

06:55.191 --> 06:56.545
Can't you go
back to sleep?

06:56.613 --> 06:58.472
No, once I'm up,
I'm up!

06:58.641 --> 07:00.240
But I want to
see you again!

07:00.308 --> 07:01.355
I'd like that.

07:01.432 --> 07:03.498
Okay, I'll bookmark
your dream coordinates

07:03.566 --> 07:05.339
and come to you
tomorrow night.

07:05.874 --> 07:07.308
What do I do with
the toothpick?

07:07.376 --> 07:08.722
I'll take it!

07:12.119 --> 07:14.630
And so then she's like,
"I really like you,"

07:14.698 --> 07:16.823
and I was like,
"I really like you, too,"

07:16.891 --> 07:20.150
and she was like, "I don't want
to hold hands until I'm in love,"

07:20.218 --> 07:21.673
and I was like,
"that sounds great.

07:21.741 --> 07:22.988
I'm all about
going slow,"

07:23.056 --> 07:26.558
and she said, "What? You don't
want to hold my hand?"

07:26.800 --> 07:27.964
Huh?!

07:28.081 --> 07:29.893
Okay, what is going on
with that toothpick?

07:29.961 --> 07:30.982
Huh?

07:31.050 --> 07:32.941
I can get you
a new toothpick.

07:33.016 --> 07:34.691
No, I don't
want a new one.

07:36.401 --> 07:37.443
I got to go!

07:37.511 --> 07:38.839
No, wait, there's one...

07:43.378 --> 07:44.569
Hi!

07:44.637 --> 07:46.042
Hi.

07:46.363 --> 07:48.636
Hmm, are there
any appetizers?

07:48.738 --> 07:51.687
No, I think it's just
ice in this dream.

07:51.983 --> 07:54.663
Oh, I wish I could
dream another place.

07:54.731 --> 07:56.389
I have an idea.

07:58.298 --> 07:59.465
My apartment.

07:59.533 --> 08:00.681
Oh.

08:00.823 --> 08:02.339
It's a bit of a mess.

08:02.856 --> 08:04.423
I'm not used to
having company.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.962
No, it's got...

08:06.039 --> 08:07.221
Personality.

08:07.402 --> 08:08.779
I know, right?

08:08.847 --> 08:10.714
Hey, do you
like board games?

08:10.911 --> 08:13.050
Tell me about this.

08:13.191 --> 08:15.105
Oh, I use that for work.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.120
It's interesting.

08:17.316 --> 08:18.823
Yeah, I guess it is.

08:18.988 --> 08:21.178
Y-you want to spy
on people's dreams?

08:21.255 --> 08:22.334
Can we?

08:22.402 --> 08:24.003
Sure.

08:31.441 --> 08:35.027
What's it like to have all
this at your fingertips?

08:35.105 --> 08:36.917
I guess I don't even
think about it.

08:36.994 --> 08:40.063
But you're not powerful enough
to see into <i> everyone's</i> dreams,

08:40.140 --> 08:42.558
- are you?
- I'm totally that powerful.

08:42.770 --> 08:44.052
Even royalty?

08:44.191 --> 08:45.936
Like Ice King
or something?

08:46.013 --> 08:47.995
His dreams are so <i> sad.</i>

08:48.159 --> 08:50.050
Like Princess Bubblegum.

08:50.243 --> 08:54.027
Surely, she has some sort of
dream security system in place.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.230
No, we can go right now.

08:56.433 --> 08:58.034
Is that what this is about?

08:58.128 --> 08:59.909
Yes, let's go right now.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.964
T-this feels weird.

09:02.113 --> 09:04.144
It seems like you
really want to go.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.089
It's okay to
feel manipulated,

09:06.166 --> 09:07.659
right?

09:27.843 --> 09:29.479
Oh, thank you!

09:29.642 --> 09:31.233
Thank you!

09:36.011 --> 09:38.714
A-After all I've
done for you?!

09:38.791 --> 09:39.811
Agh!

09:39.879 --> 09:41.645
What?
Something's wrong.

09:41.713 --> 09:43.934
Does this dream
seem weird to you?

09:51.488 --> 09:52.793
No!

09:52.862 --> 09:55.293
I worked so hard!

09:58.943 --> 10:01.311
Aaaaah!

10:06.326 --> 10:07.782
Hey! Hey, you!

10:07.850 --> 10:09.198
Huh?

10:09.532 --> 10:12.001
Do you have any
idea what you've done?

10:13.431 --> 10:15.228
You interfered
with a dream!

10:15.423 --> 10:18.440
Oh! Man, a dream I was <i> in!</i>

10:18.571 --> 10:20.621
Why did you do
it?!

10:20.853 --> 10:23.243
I... I can't
really explain it.

10:23.399 --> 10:26.036
It just felt like
the right thing to do.

10:26.142 --> 10:28.384
You... you
ruined everything!

10:28.657 --> 10:31.181
We would've been
so perfect together!

10:31.306 --> 10:35.157
Oh,<i> who</i> I am kidding?!
It's over...

10:35.274 --> 10:37.047
It doesn't
have to be over.

10:37.124 --> 10:39.298
We can run away...
Together.

10:39.439 --> 10:42.329
You're dreaming, kid,
and it's time to wake up.

10:42.454 --> 10:44.134
No, I-I...

10:45.763 --> 10:46.763
Wenk!

10:46.891 --> 10:47.962
Gunther?

10:48.030 --> 10:50.847
Oh, did baby have
a bad dream?

10:50.995 --> 10:52.837
Let me get
you a bottle.

10:54.423 --> 10:55.966
Aah!

10:58.089 --> 10:59.251
Wenk!

10:59.470 --> 11:01.728
Huh, what's eating him?
