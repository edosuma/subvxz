00:01.900 --> 00:02.769
<i>
So here's what you missed
on Glee. Will's dating</i>

00:02.836 --> 00:04.705
<i>The hot substitute, holly
holliday. She's totally sassy</i>

00:04.772 --> 00:06.773
<i>And you can really see
why he's into her.
Sexy.</i>

00:06.841 --> 00:08.508
<i>Quinn and Finn are back
together in a big way, and so</i>

00:08.576 --> 00:10.943
<i>Is the Glee club. They did
original songs, and now they're</i>

00:11.012 --> 00:12.713
<i>Headed to new york.
Get out! Go!</i>

00:12.780 --> 00:14.381
<i>But sue thinks will made her
lose at nationals, and she's</i>

00:14.449 --> 00:16.216
<i>Sort of gone over the edge,
even for her, and that's saying</i>

00:16.283 --> 00:18.318
<i>Something, and that's what you
missed on Glee!</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:23.357
(bell ringing)

00:26.227 --> 00:28.729
All right. We need $5,000

00:28.796 --> 00:30.230
To pay for our trip
to nationals in new york.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.399
What happened to the money
that we got from the cheerios!?

00:32.467 --> 00:35.068
I guess sue was hiding it
in offshore accounts

00:35.136 --> 00:36.803
In the cayman islands,
and we're having some trouble

00:36.871 --> 00:38.305
Accessing some of it.

00:38.373 --> 00:39.740
Any of it.

00:42.010 --> 00:44.811
This is salt water taffy.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.313
Ah, I love salt water.

00:46.381 --> 00:48.448
When I was a student here,
we paid for our entire trip

00:48.516 --> 00:50.650
To nationals, selling this.

00:50.718 --> 00:51.852
Classroom to classroom,

00:51.919 --> 00:52.953
Door to door,

00:53.021 --> 00:55.989
We pushed this stuff like crack.

00:56.057 --> 00:57.391
And so will we.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.560
So, to make $5,000

01:00.628 --> 01:02.362
At 25 cents apiece,

01:02.430 --> 01:05.632
We need to sell 20,000
pieces of taffy.

01:05.700 --> 01:07.901
Wait, do you honestly think that
we can sell 20,000 anythings?

01:07.969 --> 01:09.770
I mean, we won regionals

01:09.837 --> 01:12.139
For the first time since
dinosaurs roamed the planet,

01:12.206 --> 01:14.841
And I still got a freaking
cherry icee facial.

01:14.909 --> 01:18.779
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry.

01:18.846 --> 01:19.913
Yeah.
Santana is right.

01:19.981 --> 01:22.349
Nobody cares about us.

01:22.417 --> 01:23.717
I can't listen to this.

01:23.785 --> 01:24.885
Mike, are you okay?

01:24.952 --> 01:26.420
No.

01:26.487 --> 01:29.356
You guys complain all the time
about being mistreated,

01:29.424 --> 01:32.059
But you have no idea what it's
like to work your butt off

01:32.126 --> 01:34.795
For something and have everyone,
even your friends, ignore you.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.797
I am so trying to remember
his name right now.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.299
Artie, tina, brittany and
I are on the brainiacs.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.767
Isn't that the academic
decathlon team?

01:40.835 --> 01:41.902
Wait. We have one of those?

01:41.969 --> 01:43.303
Yes, we do.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.105
<i>And the four of us went
on the smartypants show,</i>

01:45.173 --> 01:47.641
And beat carmel high to go to
the academic decathlon finals

01:47.708 --> 01:50.277
In detroit next week.
What? You guys were on tv?

01:50.344 --> 01:52.179
Well, why didn't you
tell us about it?

01:52.246 --> 01:53.713
All:
We did!

01:53.781 --> 01:56.283
Wait, I... I get the three of
you being on the team...

01:56.350 --> 01:58.952
Is it because two of them are
asian, and artie wears glasses?

01:59.020 --> 02:02.155
No... But brittany?

02:02.223 --> 02:05.058
Liz schneider was our fourth,
but she got rubella.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.694
Her parents are hippies who
don't believe in vaccinations.

02:07.762 --> 02:10.062
Brittany was the only person
we could find on short notice.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.499
<i>Artie:
We bribed her with dots.</i>

02:12.567 --> 02:14.234
<i>That sunshine corazon</i>

02:14.302 --> 02:16.069
<i>That rachel sent to a crack
house was on the other team.</i>

02:16.137 --> 02:17.437
I'll take "deadly cyclones,"
please.

02:17.505 --> 02:18.939
Right on, soul sister.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.474
In 1970...

02:20.541 --> 02:23.043
The bhola cyclone.

02:23.111 --> 02:24.845
Correct again.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.414
<i>Artie: Luckily, we had
our own secret weapon.</i>

02:29.117 --> 02:30.550
I'll take "cat diseases."

02:30.618 --> 02:32.085
I won't!

02:32.153 --> 02:33.720
(audience laughing)
the first known case

02:33.788 --> 02:37.491
Of this disease was first
diagnosed in calcutta in 2001.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.860
Feline aids?

02:39.927 --> 02:41.595
(bell chiming)

02:41.662 --> 02:43.163
Rod:
Correct. Bonus question.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.731
Ringworm.

02:44.799 --> 02:46.133
Conjunctivitis.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.101
Kidney failure.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.436
(applause)

02:49.504 --> 02:52.639
Now, on to our final
speed round question.

02:52.707 --> 02:55.208
Whoever buzzes in first
and answers correctly

02:55.276 --> 02:58.545
Will win the title and go on to
our finals next week in detroit.

02:58.613 --> 03:02.549
Our final category,
"white rappers."

03:02.617 --> 03:05.185
Sadly, we can't afford to go to
the finals, so we're gonna have

03:05.253 --> 03:07.120
To forfeit.
Why don't you just have
your parents pay for it?

03:07.188 --> 03:09.055
Because we shouldn't have to.
We're a school club.

03:09.123 --> 03:10.157
The school should
pay for it.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.491
It's a matter of pride.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.226
You guys are absolutely right.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.928
How much do you need
to make the trip?

03:14.996 --> 03:16.363
With gas and motels,

03:16.430 --> 03:20.033
If we only eat funyuns,
uh, $250.

03:20.101 --> 03:21.401
Which means...

03:23.971 --> 03:27.240
We just need
to sell more taffy.

03:31.412 --> 03:34.781
I'm sure you're wondering why
I called you all together here

03:34.849 --> 03:36.583
In the dead of night,

03:36.651 --> 03:39.386
When I'm normally out
bow-hunting for hobos.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.288
Dustin goolsby,
coach of vocal adrenaline.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.689
Sandy ryerson,

03:42.757 --> 03:44.925
Defrocked educator
and legendary friend of dorothy.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.493
Terri schuester, shrew.

03:46.561 --> 03:47.994
I'm also an assistant manager.

03:48.062 --> 03:51.631
We all have one
very important thing in common.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.000
We all hate will schuester.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.001
I have a question.

03:55.069 --> 03:58.471
Are you single?
Uh, I'm not gay.

03:58.539 --> 04:02.609
I don't care. You're hunky,
and I'm what they call
"predatory gay."

04:02.677 --> 04:04.644
I'll admit I've been on
a bit of a losing streak,

04:04.712 --> 04:08.415
Having lost regionals, and if
will schuster wins at nationals,

04:08.482 --> 04:10.016
My role as reigning champion

04:10.084 --> 04:12.719
At this school will be usurped.

04:12.787 --> 04:14.254
I'm asking you for your help.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.790
Our mission?
To destroy the Glee club.

04:16.857 --> 04:20.093
We'll target their fragile sense
of self-esteem

04:20.161 --> 04:23.730
So that they implode long before
they can make it to nationals.

04:23.798 --> 04:24.864
And I call this union...

04:26.033 --> 04:27.767
...The league of doom.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.236
Ooh.

04:29.303 --> 04:30.837
Okay, first of all,
that is a ridiculous name.

04:30.905 --> 04:32.138
And second of all,
what kind of a meeting

04:32.206 --> 04:33.540
Doesn't have bagels
or something?

04:33.608 --> 04:35.408
Wow, it would be hard
to be married to you.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.876
And for the record?
Or mixed nuts...

04:36.944 --> 04:38.545
I am trying to move
on with my life.

04:38.613 --> 04:39.980
I don't hate will schuester.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.281
But you do hate the Glee club.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.016
That's true. I do.

04:43.084 --> 04:44.684
And I am looking
for a new hobby.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.019
Henceforth, you will be known

04:46.087 --> 04:47.621
By the following
super villain nicknames.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.723
Sandy ryerson,
you are the pink dagger.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.691
Yes!
You are the honey badger,

04:51.759 --> 04:53.159
Nature's most ferocious animal.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.461
Look it up on youtube.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.730
Dustin goolsby?
Sergeant handsome.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.532
My codename

04:59.600 --> 05:01.034
Will be general Zod.
Hold up.

05:01.102 --> 05:03.036
I coach the winningest
Glee club in history.

05:03.104 --> 05:05.005
We're a lock to beat mckinley
at nationals as it is.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.539
Why would I want
to get involved in this?

05:06.607 --> 05:08.642
Well, because, sergeant, you
strike me as a bit of a tool

05:08.709 --> 05:11.411
Who enjoys playing mind games
with your opponents.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.512
That's true.
I really do like doing that.

05:12.580 --> 05:13.647
Legion of evil?

05:13.714 --> 05:15.949
League of doom.
You can count me in.

05:16.017 --> 05:18.385
Although I am enjoying
my second career

05:18.452 --> 05:20.420
As a small-time
medical marijuana dealer.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.222
Okey-dokey.
It doesn't change the fact

05:22.290 --> 05:23.957
That william took my job.

05:24.025 --> 05:25.158
Here are your beepers.

05:25.226 --> 05:27.327
You will await
further instructions.

05:27.395 --> 05:31.197
And until then,
we will be known only as...

05:31.265 --> 05:33.500
The legion of evil.
I don't think I was listening
when you said what our name was.

05:33.567 --> 05:34.668
Wait a second. Is it
"league" or "legion"?

05:34.735 --> 05:36.169
Worst henchmen ever.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.809
I missed you so
much last week.

05:42.877 --> 05:44.811
So what do you want
to do tomorrow night?

05:44.879 --> 05:47.047
Whoa, there, cowboy, we haven't
even had our pizza yet.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.782
I'm just trying
to get you when I can.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.285
(laughs)

05:52.353 --> 05:54.487
You know, this is actually

05:54.555 --> 05:57.457
The first relationship
I've had where the girl

05:57.525 --> 05:59.626
Hasn't been all over me
to spend more time with her.

05:59.694 --> 06:00.894
Well, get used to it.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.228
I'm a sub.

06:02.296 --> 06:03.596
I'm a rolling stone.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.032
I warned you that being in
a relationship with me meant

06:06.100 --> 06:07.567
Being in a constant
state of wanting.

06:07.635 --> 06:11.204
I am both awesome and
unavailable at the same time.

06:11.272 --> 06:13.540
You're kind of awesome.
(laughs)

06:13.607 --> 06:15.108
What do you think about
my taffy sale plan

06:15.176 --> 06:16.509
To send the brainiacs
to detroit?

06:16.577 --> 06:20.146
Um, I think it's
as terrible as the word

06:20.214 --> 06:21.548
"brainiacs," but...

06:21.615 --> 06:23.850
Oh, okay. Here's
your problem, all right?

06:23.918 --> 06:26.052
You're thinking
too small, okay?

06:26.120 --> 06:28.988
That crazy ex-wife of yours
messed with your brain

06:29.056 --> 06:31.124
And now you think
you can't dream.

06:31.192 --> 06:32.525
Okay. Well,
what's your idea?

06:32.593 --> 06:35.595
A night of neglect.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.997
That actually sounds
like life with my ex-wife.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.101
Hilarious. No, seriously,
here's what you need to do.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.836
Have a benefit.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.005
You know how they do on tv when
there's, like, an earthquake,

06:46.073 --> 06:49.843
Or they want to raise money
for, like, a sad disease.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.077
That's actually
a really good idea.

06:51.145 --> 06:52.779
I know it is.

06:52.847 --> 06:54.781
See, your kids are feeling
really neglected, right?

06:54.849 --> 06:56.716
So you fill the auditorium
with people who are there

06:56.784 --> 06:58.218
To hear them sing, and poof!

06:58.285 --> 07:00.653
Oh, I'm loving this.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.756
And we can sell tickets.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.892
And it is a perfect place
to practice for nationals.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.360
And you know the best part?

07:07.428 --> 07:09.796
We're only going to do songs
by neglected artists.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.733
Because it's
"a night of neglect."

07:13.801 --> 07:16.269
Can you define what you mean
by "neglected artist"?

07:16.337 --> 07:19.406
Um, someone whose brilliance
isn't always appreciated.

07:19.473 --> 07:20.473
Oh, so you mean like me.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.542
I mean, like all of us.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.544
All right, everyone,
next Saturday night,

07:24.612 --> 07:25.779
In our auditorium,

07:25.846 --> 07:27.981
Mckinley high's first annual

07:28.048 --> 07:30.850
"night of neglect" fund-raiser
benefit is officially a go!

07:30.918 --> 07:32.085
(applause)

07:33.858 --> 07:35.292
(bell ringing)

07:35.359 --> 07:36.993
Sergeant handsome,
walk with me.

07:37.061 --> 07:39.329
I'm surprised
you even saw me.

07:39.397 --> 07:41.131
I was blending in
pretty well back there.

07:41.198 --> 07:43.133
Here's your mission. Word on
the street is that schuester

07:43.200 --> 07:45.669
And that substitute
holly holliday are official.

07:45.736 --> 07:47.037
I need you to
break them up.

07:47.104 --> 07:49.406
She's looser than a
thrift store turtleneck

07:49.473 --> 07:51.274
And probably
just as diseased.

07:51.342 --> 07:52.609
Just my type.

07:52.677 --> 07:54.577
Psst! Ready for my
close-up, general zog.

07:54.645 --> 07:56.179
Sandy, how do you manage
to enter a building

07:56.247 --> 07:58.214
Without setting off
all the fire alarms?

07:58.282 --> 08:00.317
You know, I have to say, with
all this sneaking around,

08:00.384 --> 08:01.918
I have never
felt more alive.

08:01.986 --> 08:03.520
What's my assignment?

08:03.587 --> 08:04.821
Pink dagger, I just learned

08:04.889 --> 08:06.623
That the Glee club
is performing a benefit concert.

08:06.691 --> 08:08.258
It's just
the opening we need.

08:08.326 --> 08:10.260
There's a student club
I want you to sponsor.

08:10.328 --> 08:12.128
Heckling.

08:12.196 --> 08:14.064
The world's
second oldest profession.

08:14.131 --> 08:15.165
Hell am I doing in here?

08:15.232 --> 08:16.232
Good. Louder.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.834
In olden times,

08:17.902 --> 08:19.269
Hecklers provided
a needed service

08:19.337 --> 08:21.771
To the medieval community.
Pink dagger, if I may.

08:21.839 --> 08:24.741
Welcome to the very first
meeting of the heckling club.

08:24.809 --> 08:26.176
You set me up.
You told me

08:26.243 --> 08:27.711
I was supposed to come here
to get homework help.

08:27.778 --> 08:29.646
Congratulations. You're all in.

08:30.815 --> 08:33.982
I'm really confused.

08:34.051 --> 08:35.684
(bell ringing)
I'm totally doing lykke li.

08:35.753 --> 08:37.654
She's bjork meets
florence and the machine,

08:37.722 --> 08:39.054
And a promising new talent.

08:39.123 --> 08:40.390
What about you, mike?

08:40.457 --> 08:42.859
The mike chang dance dance
revolution.

08:42.927 --> 08:44.728
I'm tired of my dancing
being overshadowed

08:44.795 --> 08:46.029
By all of you
guys' singing.

08:46.097 --> 08:48.798
It's going to be just me
and my sweet moves

08:48.866 --> 08:50.233
On that stage.

08:50.301 --> 08:52.736
You're forgetting about
the most neglected artist

08:52.803 --> 08:53.970
This Glee club's
ever seen--

08:54.038 --> 08:55.238
Aretha franklin.

08:55.306 --> 08:57.407
Neglected?
She's, like, the queen of soul.

08:57.475 --> 08:59.676
See, I auditioned for this club

08:59.744 --> 09:02.245
Singing "respect,"
and she's gotten none since.

09:02.313 --> 09:03.413
So I'm doing aretha.

09:03.481 --> 09:04.414
Awesome, mercedes.

09:04.482 --> 09:05.849
Awesome, all of you guys.

09:05.916 --> 09:08.017
Those songs are great appetizers
to my main course.

09:08.085 --> 09:10.320
Celine dion's "my
heart will go on."

09:10.388 --> 09:11.454
It's gonna be our finale.

09:11.522 --> 09:12.789
(imitates tires screeching)

09:12.857 --> 09:14.624
That's like the biggest
song of all time.

09:14.692 --> 09:15.959
No. You don't understand.

09:16.026 --> 09:18.228
Celine isn't the
neglected artist, I am.

09:18.295 --> 09:20.630
I was kind of hoping
to do the closing number.

09:20.698 --> 09:23.199
Hey, you guys remember
sunshine corazon?

09:23.267 --> 09:24.634
You are a terrible spy.

09:24.702 --> 09:26.202
Seriously, with your size,

09:26.270 --> 09:27.871
You easily could have stayed
in the air ducts for days.

09:27.938 --> 09:29.339
I'm not a spy.

09:29.407 --> 09:31.274
I heard about your benefit
concert on facebook,

09:31.342 --> 09:32.809
And I wanted to perform.

09:32.877 --> 09:35.612
I know what it feels like
to be in academic decathlon.

09:35.679 --> 09:38.314
No one pays attention to you.
No one cares.

09:38.382 --> 09:39.983
It's not right.
We study so hard.

09:40.050 --> 09:41.317
Yeah, but you're
in vocal adrenaline.

09:41.385 --> 09:42.552
How do we know
we can trust you?

09:42.620 --> 09:45.021
Because I have nothing
against any of you.

09:45.089 --> 09:48.525
I have 600 twitter followers.
I can get all of them to come.

09:48.592 --> 09:49.959
How many tickets
have we sold so far?

09:50.027 --> 09:52.228
Four. No one's interested.
It's just sad.

09:52.296 --> 09:54.998
Please, just let me
show you what I can do.

09:55.065 --> 09:57.300
I would like to sing
the perfect song about neglect,

09:57.368 --> 09:58.635
"all by myself."

09:58.702 --> 10:00.570
I'm such a better singer
than everyone else,

10:00.638 --> 10:02.205
So I know how it feels.

10:02.273 --> 10:04.507
I'm all alone at the top.

10:04.575 --> 10:07.610
Also, I'm really short. So even
when I'm in a group of people,

10:07.678 --> 10:09.712
It feels like I'm wandering
alone through a forest.

10:09.780 --> 10:12.115
There's no way that she's
singing in our auditorium, okay?

10:12.183 --> 10:13.650
She's the enemy.

10:13.717 --> 10:16.886
I say we give her a chance. I
mean, you owe her, rachel.

10:16.954 --> 10:19.456
You sent her to a
frickin' crack house.

12:33.891 --> 12:35.191
Absolutely not.
She's just trying

12:35.259 --> 12:37.493
To get on our good sides
so she can spy on us.

12:37.561 --> 12:38.895
You're one to talk. We told you

12:38.963 --> 12:41.397
The same thing
about jesse st. James last year.

12:41.465 --> 12:42.899
And you were right!
Finn:
This whole thing

12:42.967 --> 12:44.867
Isn't about us. It's about
helping the brainiacs.

12:44.935 --> 12:46.235
Puck:
Yeah, we need sunshine's

12:46.303 --> 12:47.770
Twitter followers to
come and pay for tickets,

12:47.838 --> 12:49.572
Or there's no point in
having a benefit at all.

12:49.640 --> 12:50.707
(sighs)

12:52.209 --> 12:55.111
Fine. Mercedes,
you're okay with being bumped

12:55.179 --> 12:56.779
To the decidedly less glamorous
middle spot.

12:56.847 --> 12:57.981
Right?

12:58.048 --> 13:00.883
Um... Sure, I guess.

13:03.053 --> 13:05.321
Absolutely.

13:10.094 --> 13:11.794
(school bell ringing)

13:11.862 --> 13:13.763
Hey, mercedes, can
I have your shoes?

13:13.831 --> 13:17.433
I promise to give you a dirty
pair of my flip-flops in return.

13:17.501 --> 13:19.135
Do you know how hard it is

13:19.203 --> 13:20.837
To find high-top, yellow
patent leather sneakers?

13:20.904 --> 13:22.372
Really? I'm surprised

13:22.439 --> 13:24.474
You didn't just give them
to me, considering

13:24.541 --> 13:25.775
How little you
think of yourself.

13:25.843 --> 13:27.910
You're the most talented singer
in Glee club,

13:27.978 --> 13:30.113
Yet you're constantly taking
the backseat to everyone.

13:30.180 --> 13:32.115
Well, what am I supposed to do?

13:32.182 --> 13:34.450
I'm-I'm tired of fighting
with rachel all the time.

13:34.518 --> 13:37.520
Okay, you're always singing
about r-e-s-p-e-c-t,

13:37.588 --> 13:39.522
But respect isn't something
you can ask for.

13:39.590 --> 13:40.857
You have to demand it.

13:40.924 --> 13:42.458
And you deserve it.

13:42.526 --> 13:44.527
You don't seem to have trouble
in that department.
Right.

13:44.595 --> 13:46.062
You know what?

13:46.130 --> 13:48.698
Neither does aretha
or j-lo or mariah.

13:48.766 --> 13:51.200
You know why? Because
they get proof every day.

13:51.268 --> 13:53.736
I heard mariah
makes appointments at 9:00 a.M.,

13:53.804 --> 13:55.938
And shows up at 4:00
in the afternoon

13:56.006 --> 13:58.775
Because she knows
people will wait.

13:58.842 --> 14:01.077
But those kinds
of demands are ridiculous.

14:01.145 --> 14:02.912
Exactly. But once
you see that no matter

14:02.980 --> 14:04.781
How ridiculous your demands,
people will meet them,

14:04.848 --> 14:06.249
You know
you have it.
Have what?

14:06.316 --> 14:09.786
Respect. And as your manager,

14:09.853 --> 14:11.120
I'd say you're
thinking too small.

14:11.188 --> 14:13.156
Wait a minute.
Since when are you my manager?

14:13.223 --> 14:15.191
Since you agreed to
give me ten percent

14:15.259 --> 14:17.927
Of whatever we can come
up with to ask for.

14:20.030 --> 14:22.131
Sister, you got yourself a deal.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.822
(whirring)

14:29.660 --> 14:31.628
Are you okay?

14:31.696 --> 14:34.297
Yup. I will be as soon
as this counter's really clean.

14:36.134 --> 14:38.835
I hear that ocd symptoms
tend to get worse

14:38.903 --> 14:40.737
When the person
is under great stress.

14:42.940 --> 14:44.441
(sniffles)

14:44.509 --> 14:46.009
Carl's gone.

14:50.548 --> 14:52.616
He asked for an annulment,

14:52.683 --> 14:55.819
Which I guess

14:55.887 --> 14:57.387
He's legally entitled to,

14:57.455 --> 15:00.190
Considering we never actually
consummated the marriage.

15:00.258 --> 15:01.158
You guys never...?

15:05.229 --> 15:06.730
At what age are you allowed

15:06.798 --> 15:09.733
To look back on your life
with nothing but regret?

15:09.801 --> 15:11.201
Is 32 too young?

15:17.542 --> 15:18.909
I actually believed

15:18.976 --> 15:21.344
That I'd have a handle
on my ocd by now.

15:23.681 --> 15:27.217
It's just been so long, and...

15:27.285 --> 15:29.119
I'm so tired.

15:34.525 --> 15:36.526
This your lunch?

15:36.594 --> 15:38.695
Yeah.

15:45.503 --> 15:47.370
What are you doing?

15:50.374 --> 15:53.443
One day, you're going to find
a way to beat this thing.

15:53.511 --> 15:55.011
Until then,

15:55.079 --> 15:57.581
I'm here for you.

15:57.648 --> 15:59.015
No judgment.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.118
Just...

16:01.185 --> 16:02.986
A friend that you can count on.

16:05.523 --> 16:07.657
Cheers.

16:13.865 --> 16:15.332
(school bell ringing)
Finn:
So, uh, the braniacs

16:15.399 --> 16:18.235
Asked us to be benefit heads
for the night of neglect.

16:18.302 --> 16:19.669
Quinn:
And we would like to select you

16:19.737 --> 16:21.004
Head of talent relations.

16:21.072 --> 16:22.305
We figured
you're probably used to relating

16:22.373 --> 16:24.274
To talent
because you're so talented.

16:24.342 --> 16:27.010
Well, first, I'm honored
that you came to me,

16:27.078 --> 16:29.546
But I think it's a little
insensitive of you to be

16:29.614 --> 16:31.615
Flaunting your
dating in my face.
Fantastic.

16:31.682 --> 16:34.618
'cause we are having problems
with one of our performers.

16:34.685 --> 16:36.786
A) I need a bowl of green m&Ms.

16:36.854 --> 16:39.389
And by bowl, I mean large bowl.
Well, really a small barrel.

16:39.457 --> 16:40.590
O... Kay.

16:40.658 --> 16:41.992
Two) I need humidifiers.

16:42.059 --> 16:45.028
Lots of humidifiers.
A team of humidifiers

16:45.096 --> 16:46.630
Whose only job is to make

16:46.697 --> 16:48.331
The air that mercedes
breathes more humid.

16:48.399 --> 16:50.667
We'll try our best.
Shh. I'm not finished.

16:50.735 --> 16:53.336
Before every performance,
I like to wash my hands.

16:53.404 --> 16:56.940
And after doing so, I like to
dry them on a fresh puppy.

16:57.008 --> 16:59.109
Excuse me?
I believe you heard Ms. Jones.

16:59.177 --> 17:01.111
In fact, if I were you, I'd
probably get a whole litter

17:01.179 --> 17:03.180
Of fluffy puppies, just in case
she decides

17:03.247 --> 17:05.382
To take a post-show shower.

17:05.449 --> 17:06.516
Stars make demands
the way that babies

17:06.584 --> 17:07.751
Make messes in their diapers.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.452
They can't help it.
What a star wants is

17:09.520 --> 17:11.154
To just feel appreciated
and respected.

17:11.222 --> 17:13.323
They just want to feel
like they're being heard.

17:13.391 --> 17:15.058
She seemed pretty serious
about the puppy.

17:15.126 --> 17:17.928
Well, obviously, hers is a
talent that we have neglected.

17:17.994 --> 17:19.229
I can relate.

17:19.297 --> 17:21.665
So leave it to me.
I'll take care of it.

17:24.234 --> 17:25.569
(british accent):
Hello, class.

17:25.636 --> 17:27.637
I am the world's most famous
and stylish divorcee

17:27.704 --> 17:30.006
Wallace simpson.

17:30.074 --> 17:32.809
I was married a bunch of times,
and then I fell in love

17:32.877 --> 17:35.245
With edward viii and made him
abdicate the throne.

17:35.313 --> 17:39.749
I had giant hands,
so a lot of people thought

17:39.817 --> 17:42.552
I was a hermaphrodite, but
that wasn't true. Others said

17:42.620 --> 17:44.287
I was a nazi sympathizer.

17:44.355 --> 17:45.822
<i>That was true.</i>

17:45.890 --> 17:48.391
Boy, did I think
that hitler showed promise!

17:48.459 --> 17:49.993
(bell rings)
(normal voice):
Tomorrow we're gonna do

17:50.061 --> 17:53.663
Catherine the great and her pet
stallion fred, so come early.

17:57.235 --> 17:59.202
We haven't been
introduced.

17:59.270 --> 18:01.438
I'm dustin goolsby,
coach of vocal adrenaline.

18:01.505 --> 18:03.206
Oh.

18:03.274 --> 18:04.975
So you're the big
competition at nationals.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.444
Well, thank you very much
for volunteering your star

18:07.511 --> 18:09.946
For our night
of neglect benefit.

18:10.014 --> 18:12.649
What are you talking about?
I never approved that.

18:12.717 --> 18:16.486
Let me cut to
the sexy chase.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.054
Think about how
many more years

18:18.122 --> 18:19.522
You have left of
productive ovulating.

18:19.590 --> 18:22.359
Those aren't eggs in
those fallopian tubes.

18:22.426 --> 18:24.394
They're rare,
exotic pearls.

18:24.462 --> 18:26.963
Oh. So you're trying
to seduce me.

18:27.031 --> 18:28.999
Jackpot. This hairline
is 85% my own,

18:29.066 --> 18:31.034
And my sperm count
is off the charts.

18:31.102 --> 18:32.636
Well... (laughs)

18:32.703 --> 18:35.972
...As tempting as that sounds,
I have a boyfriend.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.274
Yeah, you do now.

18:37.341 --> 18:39.476
Admit it.
I'm handsome,

18:39.543 --> 18:41.478
I'm good-looking, and
I'm easy on the eyes.

18:41.545 --> 18:43.313
Also, I'm gorgeous.

18:43.381 --> 18:46.916
And I'm dating
will schuester.

18:46.984 --> 18:48.251
Let me tell you something
about will schuester.

18:48.319 --> 18:49.986
That guy has
tiny baby hands.

18:50.054 --> 18:52.022
Seriously. It's weird.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.091
Once I saw him try to pick up a
big mac, and he couldn't do it.

18:55.159 --> 18:56.526
He had to eat it
layer by layer.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.895
Teeny, tiny, wee

18:58.963 --> 19:00.163
Baby hands.

19:00.231 --> 19:03.199
That are big enough
to knock your teeth out.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.801
Well, this is awkward.

19:06.537 --> 19:08.571
Consider my offer.

19:10.775 --> 19:11.975
What offer?

19:12.043 --> 19:13.310
He was just
hitting on me.

19:13.377 --> 19:15.211
Isn't that silly?

19:17.615 --> 19:19.115
What's wrong?

19:19.183 --> 19:21.418
Well, we were supposed to have
lunch, and you don't show.

19:21.485 --> 19:23.853
And now you're getting hit on
by the coach of our archrival.

19:23.921 --> 19:25.655
How is that my fault?

19:25.723 --> 19:27.624
And by the way, I did
show up for lunch,

19:27.692 --> 19:29.092
And you looked like
you were actually having

19:29.160 --> 19:31.194
A pretty good time.

19:31.262 --> 19:34.164
I kind of felt
like I was intruding, so...

19:34.231 --> 19:35.632
Oh, man. I am...

19:35.700 --> 19:37.434
I am not the jealous type, will.

19:37.501 --> 19:39.336
Neither am I.

19:39.403 --> 19:43.373
Look, how about instead
of a pointless argument,

19:43.441 --> 19:45.775
We rehearse our duet
for the benefit?

19:45.843 --> 19:49.679
I really don't, uh, feel in the
mood to do a duet right now.

19:51.248 --> 19:53.550
I think I just have
to clear my head.

19:56.253 --> 19:59.055
Uh, no problem.

20:02.026 --> 20:04.394
I'll see you at the benefit.

20:06.397 --> 20:09.532
(school bell ringing)

20:09.600 --> 20:11.801
Well, as you can see,
we have followed

20:11.869 --> 20:14.137
Your exact specifications.

20:14.205 --> 20:16.072
Wait, where's my puppy?

20:16.140 --> 20:17.674
She specifically
asked for a puppy.

20:17.742 --> 20:19.509
Mercedes:
This is unbelievable.

20:19.577 --> 20:22.178
How am I supposed
to work like this?
Don't worry. Puckerman is

20:22.246 --> 20:25.415
Out right now scouring pounds
for the perfect pomeranian.

20:25.483 --> 20:27.417
Good. This is almost
worthy of the artist

20:27.485 --> 20:29.486
Doing the closing
number at the benefit.

20:29.553 --> 20:32.021
Well, actually, um, sunshine

20:32.089 --> 20:34.357
Is going to be doing
the last number, because

20:34.425 --> 20:36.126
She's bringing in hundreds
of people.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.061
And so, I'll go on

20:38.129 --> 20:39.796
Before sunshine
because, I'm, well, me,

20:39.864 --> 20:43.166
And, uh, Ms. Holliday and
mercedes will go on before me.

20:43.234 --> 20:44.634
Fine.

20:45.970 --> 20:47.871
But Ms. Jones isn't
happy about it.

20:47.938 --> 20:49.205
In exchange, she's demanding

20:49.273 --> 20:51.341
That during the day
of the benefit, her feet

20:51.409 --> 20:53.476
Never touch
the ground.
Excuse me?

20:53.544 --> 20:55.412
Oh, did you not see
celine's wedding?
Carried in.

20:55.479 --> 20:56.679
Cher's comeback tour?
Carried in.

20:56.747 --> 20:57.847
Gaga at the grammys?

20:57.915 --> 20:59.749
Carried the hell in.

20:59.817 --> 21:01.418
Um, I'm sorry. Are-are

21:01.485 --> 21:04.754
You saying that you want to be
carried in in a giant egg?

21:07.758 --> 21:09.726
We'll get back to you.

21:12.288 --> 21:13.689
And that was
the spanish classroom.

21:13.757 --> 21:15.624
And of course,
you know the choir room.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.059
Brittany:
Hey, you guys, you better

21:17.127 --> 21:18.661
Get in the auditorium.
The show's about to start.

21:18.728 --> 21:19.995
It's going to be a
full house, ya'll.

21:20.063 --> 21:21.797
Got to get there early
to get a good seat.

21:21.865 --> 21:23.699
We'll be there in a minute.
I'm just showing blaine around.

21:23.767 --> 21:25.234
Thanks for coming and
supporting us, guys.

21:25.301 --> 21:26.368
It's really cool.

21:26.436 --> 21:27.569
Bye.

21:30.106 --> 21:31.707
Oh, you miss them.

21:31.775 --> 21:34.743
What the hell
are you two doing here?

21:34.811 --> 21:36.245
We're here for the benefit.
Don't tell me you're going.

21:36.312 --> 21:37.579
I wouldn't be caught dead.

21:37.647 --> 21:39.448
I was pumping iron
in the gym,

21:39.516 --> 21:41.083
And one of the guys told me
you two were here

21:41.151 --> 21:42.785
Spreading your fairy dust
all over the place.

21:42.852 --> 21:44.286
Would you just give it up?

21:44.354 --> 21:46.121
You can live whatever lie
you want, but don't pretend

21:46.189 --> 21:47.723
The three of us don't know
what's really going on here.

21:47.791 --> 21:49.525
You don't know squat, butt boy.

21:49.592 --> 21:52.461
Hey, no, guys, stop!
Real brave with your fists,

21:52.529 --> 21:54.496
But you're a coward when
it comes to the truth.

21:54.564 --> 21:57.366
Truth about what?
It's none
of your business, j.Lo.

21:59.235 --> 22:01.203
First of all, anything
you do became my business

22:01.271 --> 22:04.106
When you decided to toss
that slushee up in my grill.

22:04.174 --> 22:06.542
I think I can take a couple
of queers and a girl.

22:06.609 --> 22:08.711
(chuckles)
okay.

22:08.778 --> 22:10.079
See, here's what's gonna
go down. Two choices.

22:10.146 --> 22:12.514
You stay here,
and I crack one of your nuts--

22:12.582 --> 22:15.551
Right or left, that's your
choice-- or you walk away,

22:15.618 --> 22:17.286
And live to be a
douchebag another day.

22:17.353 --> 22:20.556
Oh, and also, I have
razorblades hidden in my hair.

22:20.623 --> 22:21.890
Mm-hmm. Tons.

22:21.958 --> 22:23.692
Just all up in there.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.894
Mm-hmm.

22:25.962 --> 22:26.995
We could have
handled that.

22:27.063 --> 22:29.131
It was more fun
doing it together.

22:29.199 --> 22:30.265
(phone vibrates)

22:30.333 --> 22:33.335
Oh, crap.

According to
sunshine's twitter,

22:40.110 --> 22:42.144
She's not coming, and neither
are any of her followers.

22:42.212 --> 22:43.912
I told you. She's evil.

22:43.980 --> 22:44.980
I was just in the auditorium.

22:45.048 --> 22:46.348
There's, like,
six people in there.

22:46.416 --> 22:47.950
I say we blow this whole thing
off and hit the arcade.

22:50.019 --> 22:52.221
No. No. Screw that.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.490
These people paid
to see us sing.

22:54.557 --> 22:55.991
What's that saying?

22:56.059 --> 22:58.527
The show's got to go all over
the place or something.

22:58.595 --> 23:00.229
You mean, "the show must go on."
yeah.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.663
Finn's right, you guys.

23:01.731 --> 23:03.432
Okay, whether there's
six or 6,000 people,

23:03.500 --> 23:05.467
Out there, we still have
to give it our all.

23:05.535 --> 23:07.903
Okay, tina,
you're up first.

It's the worst I've ever felt
in my entire life.

24:12.902 --> 24:14.336
I didn't think
it was possible

24:14.404 --> 24:15.504
For people to
hate us even more.

24:15.572 --> 24:16.905
We're calling this off.

24:16.973 --> 24:20.075
Guys, I hate to say it,
but I think we have to buck up.

Tina, I'm sorry you had
to go through that,

24:22.378 --> 24:24.179

lesson for us.

I mean, that's
a part of show business, guys.

24:26.583 --> 24:27.983
Sometimes people
can be really mean.

24:28.051 --> 24:29.685
Think about
what's going to happen

24:29.752 --> 24:31.620
If we have an unfriendly crowd
at nationals in new york.

24:31.688 --> 24:33.155
And I'm sure there's going

24:33.223 --> 24:34.857
To be some vocal adrenaline
hecklers there, too.

24:34.924 --> 24:37.860
We need to find some strength
and barrel through this.

24:37.927 --> 24:40.329
I think I may know a way
to shut those hecklers up

24:40.396 --> 24:41.597
For a number or two.

24:41.664 --> 24:43.966
Take as much
as you want.

26:35.111 --> 26:36.812

26:39.015 --> 26:41.116
Terrific job, mike.
Whoo!

26:41.184 --> 26:43.285
Hey, sounds like the heckling
club loved our refreshments.

26:43.353 --> 26:45.087
Yeah, but we're almost
out of that taffy.

26:45.154 --> 26:46.455
How are we going to keep them

26:46.522 --> 26:47.889
From going after us again
after the intermission?

26:47.957 --> 26:49.891
By being so good
that they can't heckle us.

26:49.959 --> 26:51.193
And I know just
the person for the job.

26:51.260 --> 26:53.562
W-where's mercedes?

26:53.629 --> 26:55.831
She's up.
(door closes)

26:55.898 --> 26:57.666
I'm sorry.
Ms. Jones has not appreciated

26:57.734 --> 26:58.867
The way she's been treated

26:58.935 --> 27:00.469
And is refusing to go on.

27:00.536 --> 27:02.604
(sighs)
let me talk to her.

27:02.672 --> 27:06.575
Don't bother. Mercedes
has left the building.

27:07.977 --> 27:09.511
Okay, you guys,
go find mercedes.

27:09.579 --> 27:11.279
I'm gonna go deal
with the haters.

27:17.254 --> 27:18.554
Are we in trouble?

27:18.622 --> 27:19.989
Oh, no. Not at all.

27:20.057 --> 27:22.058
I was just taking the
opportunity of intermission

27:22.125 --> 27:23.860
To tell you guys
what great hecklers you are.

27:23.927 --> 27:26.195
You must practice a lot.

27:26.263 --> 27:28.764
No, not that much.
Just on the internet only.

27:28.832 --> 27:32.435
<i>You know, my posts on NCIS
and CSI: Miami chat rooms</i>

27:32.503 --> 27:34.103
Are legendary.
You're kidding.
I've never seen you on there.

27:34.171 --> 27:38.541
You wouldn't. Because I post as
"ncisucks" or "ncistupid."

27:38.609 --> 27:42.211
<i>I'm "the beckster" on the
entertainment weekly chatrooms.</i>

27:42.279 --> 27:44.647
And my "curlyhairincairo"
twitter account

27:44.715 --> 27:46.015
Helped bring down mubarak.

27:46.083 --> 27:49.919
Technology has allowed us
to be brutally cruel

27:49.987 --> 27:51.354
Without suffering
any consequences.

27:51.421 --> 27:53.356
In the past, if I wanted to tell
someone they sucked,

27:53.423 --> 27:54.757
I'd have to say it
to their face,

27:54.825 --> 27:56.459
Which would usually result

27:56.527 --> 27:58.094
In them kicking
me in the groin.

27:58.161 --> 28:01.130
I get it. We live
in a culture of insults.

28:01.198 --> 28:03.633
I mean, we're constantly
bombarded with these

28:03.700 --> 28:07.103
Images of people who are richer
than us, and happier than us,

28:07.170 --> 28:09.972
And have more interesting
sex than us, and it
makes us feel terrible.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.440
Preach.

28:11.508 --> 28:14.143
You know, we tear them down
to feel better about ourselves.

28:14.211 --> 28:16.178
And we don't just stop
with the people who are on tv

28:16.246 --> 28:17.813
Or in magazines,
we do it to everybody.

28:17.881 --> 28:20.616
And we think that because
it's done anonymously,

28:20.684 --> 28:23.686
There are no ramifications.

28:23.754 --> 28:25.888
But there are ramifications,
guys.

28:25.956 --> 28:28.824
Because it makes you comfortable
with insensitivity.

28:28.892 --> 28:31.127
Do you know that one of
the girls you heckled tonight

28:31.194 --> 28:33.229
Has been crying for an hour?

28:35.098 --> 28:36.666
Are you saying
you never ragged on anybody?

28:36.733 --> 28:38.935
Oh, of course I did.
I spent three years

28:39.002 --> 28:40.703
Sending hate mail
to debbie gibson

28:40.771 --> 28:42.638
Until she wrote
me back and said

28:42.706 --> 28:44.774
That the stress of my letters
was giving her alopecia.

28:44.841 --> 28:46.042
And then I felt terrible

28:46.109 --> 28:48.377
Because I realized
it was just my jealousy

28:48.445 --> 28:51.347
That she could fill a mall
with her adoring fans.

28:51.415 --> 28:52.815
You guys are great kids.

28:52.883 --> 28:56.552
Some of those insults were rad.

28:56.620 --> 28:59.455
But just think about how
you could lift up the world

28:59.523 --> 29:01.557
If you turned some
of those barbs into roses.

29:01.625 --> 29:04.427
I mean, intermission's almost
over. Why don't you get back

29:04.494 --> 29:07.563
In there and turn some of that
jeering into cheering?

29:09.566 --> 29:12.034
Na, no. I think
I'm just going to go home,

29:12.102 --> 29:15.304
Probably do a new post about
how handsome mark harmon is.

29:15.372 --> 29:16.839
Me, too. I'm out.

29:18.208 --> 29:19.375
I'm splitting, too.

29:19.443 --> 29:21.444
They say, "if you have nothing
nice to say..."

29:24.348 --> 29:26.148
I'll be 18 in three years.

29:26.216 --> 29:27.583
Wait for me?

29:28.785 --> 29:30.720
Let me in. Let me in.

29:30.787 --> 29:32.622
Come on. It's raining.

29:34.191 --> 29:36.292
We've all been
looking for you.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.961
Don't bother with the pep talk.
I'm not going back in there.

29:39.029 --> 29:40.329
My demands were not met.

29:40.397 --> 29:42.231
Have you ever read anything
about aretha franklin?

29:43.600 --> 29:44.834
She was a gospel singer.

29:44.901 --> 29:47.703
And one day, she went
to this-this show.

29:47.771 --> 29:50.106
Nothing fancy. It was
just, like, a state fair.

29:50.173 --> 29:51.741
And the master
of ceremonies

29:51.808 --> 29:54.910
Hands her a tiara and calls
her the queen of soul.

29:56.380 --> 29:58.414
And that's
how she earned her crown.

29:58.482 --> 30:00.616
That's how she gained
all of her respect.

30:00.684 --> 30:03.419
Not by-by requesting
for special pillows,

30:03.487 --> 30:05.621
Or-or food, but...

30:05.689 --> 30:08.290
For doing what she does best:
Singing.

30:08.358 --> 30:10.960
I just don't get it.

30:11.028 --> 30:12.828
Why are you
a bigger star than me?

30:14.164 --> 30:16.799
You always get
the big solos,

30:16.867 --> 30:19.435
The best songs,
the moments in the sun.

30:19.503 --> 30:22.138
Why is it never me?

30:22.205 --> 30:24.674
I don't know.

30:26.743 --> 30:29.378
I mean, you're just as good
of a singer as I am.

30:29.446 --> 30:31.147
Yeah.
And everyone actually likes me.

30:31.214 --> 30:32.481
That's your problem.

30:32.549 --> 30:34.950
Because I would rather
be a star than be liked.

30:35.018 --> 30:36.318
And-and...

30:36.386 --> 30:38.354
I'm not saying
that it's healthy,

30:38.422 --> 30:40.289
And I'm not saying that it's
better than being loved,

30:40.357 --> 30:43.225
But there's nothing--

30:43.293 --> 30:45.327
<i>Nothing-- that I wouldn't do</i>

30:45.395 --> 30:47.396
For the chance
to be in the spotlight.

30:47.464 --> 30:48.964
I just...

30:49.032 --> 30:51.867
Really wanted that closing slot.

30:51.935 --> 30:54.804
Well, if you want
that closing slot,

30:54.871 --> 30:59.175
Then go in there
and take it from me.

31:02.612 --> 31:05.381
Where is everybody?
Let's get on with it.

31:05.449 --> 31:07.516
You're a really horrible
person, you know that?

31:07.584 --> 31:10.653
You sound like my
court-appointed therapist.

31:10.721 --> 31:13.589
Pink dagger, I'm going to need
to speak with you right now.

31:13.657 --> 31:14.924
Yes, general.

31:14.991 --> 31:17.259
You know, I had a feeling
you might be behind this.

31:17.327 --> 31:19.562
You have no proof.

31:19.629 --> 31:22.098
(sighs)

31:22.165 --> 31:24.366
Sam:
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

Jacob ben israel, azimio

34:20.754 --> 34:23.755
And becky jackson leave the
benefit they were supposed to be

34:23.824 --> 34:26.726
Ruining together in a car with
the license plate "jewfro."

34:26.793 --> 34:28.460
I lost track of 'em.

34:28.527 --> 34:31.364
I went into the bathroom,
when I came out, they were gone.

34:31.431 --> 34:33.232
I was applying
a light coat of powder

34:33.300 --> 34:34.500
And practicing catch phrases

34:34.568 --> 34:36.902
To use when I really
take someone down a peg.

34:36.969 --> 34:38.704
Like?

34:38.772 --> 34:41.273
You just got poked.

34:41.341 --> 34:43.576
Poked by the dagger!

34:45.145 --> 34:47.413
Your job was to
crush their spirit,

34:47.481 --> 34:49.614
And had you done
that, they would have

34:49.683 --> 34:50.983
Closed up shop
by intermission.

34:51.051 --> 34:53.052
Now get back in
there and question

34:53.120 --> 34:55.554
The whole purpose
of arts education.

34:55.621 --> 34:57.123
I'm getting back in there.

34:57.190 --> 35:00.760
That Glee club's not
gonna know what hit 'em!

35:00.827 --> 35:02.862
I tried,
but I don't think she's coming.

35:02.929 --> 35:05.831
I need to start warming up.

35:05.899 --> 35:07.500
Lauren, you're her manager.

35:07.567 --> 35:09.135
Why don't you do something?

35:09.202 --> 35:11.837
See, my client, Ms. Jones,
is not picking up her phone.

35:11.905 --> 35:13.105
Oh.
So... (clears throat)

35:13.173 --> 35:14.640
Miss jones is fine.

35:14.708 --> 35:17.476
Wait. Shouldn't one of us
be carrying you in?

35:17.544 --> 35:18.978
(scoffs)

35:19.046 --> 35:21.447
I have only one
more demand.

35:21.515 --> 35:23.883
I demand

35:23.950 --> 35:27.253
That all of you get your butts
out there and watch me sing.

35:27.320 --> 35:28.287
(cheering,
overlapping chatter)

35:28.355 --> 35:29.588
Hallelujah!

35:29.656 --> 35:30.923
You heard the woman.
Let's go.

35:30.991 --> 35:32.491
(overlapping chatter)

35:32.559 --> 35:36.495
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Ms. Mercedes jones.

Oh.

All right, girl,
time for the closing number.

38:43.016 --> 38:44.283
Go bring the house down.

38:44.351 --> 38:46.285
Are you kidding me?

38:46.353 --> 38:47.987
Nobody could follow that.

38:48.054 --> 38:50.422
Okay, the house has been
brought down.

38:50.490 --> 38:52.558
<i>That was the closing number.</i>

Bye. Hey, hot stuff.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.035
Hey.
How are the kids doing?

39:03.103 --> 39:05.237
They were amazeballs
tonight, right?
Yeah, they're good.

39:05.305 --> 39:08.073
Everyone's in the choir room,
and they all want to thank you

39:08.141 --> 39:10.409
For helping out with the benefit
and the hecklers and...

39:10.477 --> 39:13.145
Why were you in the janitor's
closet with the door closed?

39:13.213 --> 39:14.446
Okay, 'cause I'm a sub,

39:14.514 --> 39:16.382
And that's the office
that figgins gives me.

39:16.449 --> 39:18.317
Guess what?

39:18.385 --> 39:21.253
I just got offered a job
to teach french in cleveland.

39:21.321 --> 39:23.489
Isn't that great?

39:23.556 --> 39:25.658
Full time?

39:25.725 --> 39:27.993
No. Who are you talking to?
Four months, tops.

39:28.061 --> 39:30.763
Don't you have any feelings
about leaving?

39:30.830 --> 39:32.731
Didn't you listen to my song?

39:32.799 --> 39:33.966
I told you, will.

39:34.034 --> 39:35.401
I live the glamorous life

39:35.468 --> 39:37.169
Of a substitute teacher,

39:37.237 --> 39:38.871
And I'm deathly allergic
to commitment.

39:38.938 --> 39:41.173
You knew that this
was going to end this way.

39:43.410 --> 39:45.944
Yeah.

39:46.012 --> 39:47.913
Doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.

39:47.981 --> 39:49.948
You're too nice for me.

39:50.016 --> 39:51.784
But you broke my record.

39:51.851 --> 39:53.419
Five dates.

39:53.486 --> 39:54.853
Are you counting that one

39:54.921 --> 39:56.588
We had in the janitor's
closet yesterday?

39:56.656 --> 39:58.924
That was my favorite one.

39:58.992 --> 40:00.893
Mine, too.

40:02.996 --> 40:05.898
You think
you're ever gonna settle down?

40:05.965 --> 40:08.100
Maybe.

40:10.637 --> 40:12.471
But not with you.

40:15.542 --> 40:17.910
You're in love
with somebody else,

40:17.977 --> 40:20.713
And thanks to my counseling,
she's available now.

40:31.091 --> 40:35.227
And by the way,
she's totally into you, too.

40:35.295 --> 40:37.129
Holly?

40:39.733 --> 40:42.234
Will you come
back and visit?

40:42.302 --> 40:44.370
(sighs)

40:44.437 --> 40:46.972
(voice breaking):
I thought you'd never ask.

40:50.377 --> 40:52.244
(sighs)

40:57.984 --> 41:00.352
(sighs)

41:04.591 --> 41:07.025
Sandy, what are
you doing in here?

41:07.093 --> 41:10.028
I tried to be a hater,
but I just couldn't do it.

41:10.096 --> 41:12.798
That song and the weed
I smoked immediately prior--

41:12.866 --> 41:14.433
It gave me

41:14.501 --> 41:15.868
A change of heart.

41:15.935 --> 41:17.903
Mr. Ryerson offered
to pay for our trip.

41:17.971 --> 41:19.972
(whooping)
bring it!

41:20.039 --> 41:21.907
It's drug money, but you know,

41:21.975 --> 41:24.243
It's actually a fantastic way
to launder it.

41:25.678 --> 41:27.880
Good-bye, william.

41:27.947 --> 41:30.215
I miss the arts, I really do.

41:35.088 --> 41:37.556
You just got poked.

41:37.624 --> 41:39.358
Poked by the dagger!

41:40.593 --> 41:43.262
(applause and cheering)

41:43.329 --> 41:45.164
All (chanting):
Detroit! Detroit! Detroit!

41:45.231 --> 41:46.932
Detroit! Detroit! Detroit!

41:48.134 --> 41:50.702
This is a disaster.

41:50.770 --> 41:53.405
Pink dagger, not
only did you fail

41:53.473 --> 41:55.207
To disrupt the
night of neglect.

41:55.275 --> 41:56.642
You funded it in full.

41:56.709 --> 41:59.111
In fact,
you were its only donor.

41:59.179 --> 42:00.879
Aretha is my kryptonite.

42:00.947 --> 42:02.114
Sergeant handsome,

42:02.182 --> 42:04.583
What do you have
to say for yourself?

42:04.651 --> 42:07.719
Hey, I did get them to break up.
Who knew it was gonna be

42:07.787 --> 42:10.289
Amicable, and sort of have
nothing to do with me? I pulled

42:10.356 --> 42:13.258
Sunshine out of the benefit.
Don't I get credit for that?

42:13.326 --> 42:17.095
No. In my hour of need,
honey badger, I turn to you.

42:17.163 --> 42:18.597
Your time has come.

42:21.167 --> 42:23.368
(applause)

42:23.436 --> 42:26.472
Well, at the end of regulation,
we're all tied up.

42:26.539 --> 42:28.240
Excuse me, mr. Remington?

42:28.308 --> 42:31.276
We would just like to say hi
to our friends in Glee club.

42:31.344 --> 42:32.511
We love you guys.
Love you.

42:32.579 --> 42:33.412
And now...
Love you.

42:33.480 --> 42:35.681
...The tie-breaker question.

42:35.748 --> 42:38.150
The category: "hermaphrodite
nazi sympathizers."
