00:03.594 --> 00:06.971
This textbook is what
you wanted me to see?

00:07.179 --> 00:08.930
Not exactly.

00:13.058 --> 00:14.602
Look familiar?

00:14.852 --> 00:17.312
This was my first astronomy book.

00:17.520 --> 00:20.272
My father got it for me
on my 8th birthday.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.898
I used to stare
at the cover for hours.

00:23.107 --> 00:25.860
The Arachnid Nebula.

00:26.067 --> 00:29.237
Who'd ever have thought
I would get to see it in person.

00:29.862 --> 00:33.072
It's less than a light year away.
We'll be there in a few hours.

00:33.281 --> 00:37.284
"From the library
of Admiral Jonny Archer"?

00:38.160 --> 00:40.995
I had high hopes when I was a kid.

00:41.620 --> 00:43.122
- Yes?
- Sir,

00:43.329 --> 00:46.124
there's a ship approaching
at half impulse. They're hailing us.

00:46.332 --> 00:47.332
Do you know who it is?

00:47.541 --> 00:50.418
Hoshi says they're using
a Vulcan frequency.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:04.510 --> 01:08.180
Doesn't look like any
Vulcan ship I've ever seen.

01:09.390 --> 01:12.100
This class of vessel hasn't
been used for a long time.

01:12.350 --> 01:14.768
They're hailing us again.

01:18.312 --> 01:22.482
- Is this the Earth vessel, Enterprise?
- It is.

01:22.691 --> 01:24.317
I'm Captain Jonathan Archer.

01:24.568 --> 01:27.945
My name is Tavin,
captain of the Vahklas.

01:28.152 --> 01:29.737
It's very good to meet you.

01:37.660 --> 01:42.996
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:45.456 --> 01:48.875
"It's been a long time"

01:49.084 --> 01:52.920
"But my time is finally near"

01:53.129 --> 01:57.382
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

01:57.590 --> 02:00.509
"I will touch the sky"

02:00.717 --> 02:04.512
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

02:04.720 --> 02:07.722
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

02:07.931 --> 02:12.643
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

02:12.851 --> 02:15.770
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

02:15.978 --> 02:20.564
"I've got faith to believe"

02:20.773 --> 02:23.358
"I can do anything"

02:23.566 --> 02:28.070
"I've got strength of the soul"

02:28.278 --> 02:31.155
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

02:31.364 --> 02:36.701
"I can reach any star"

02:37.077 --> 02:40.828
"I've got faith"

02:41.037 --> 02:44.748
"I've got faith"

02:44.957 --> 02:49.752
"Faith of the heart"

03:01.635 --> 03:05.304
I get the feeling you weren't
sent out here by the High Command.

03:05.554 --> 03:07.932
Not quite. We're a civilian ship.

03:08.181 --> 03:09.516
What brings you out this far?

03:09.724 --> 03:13.602
I suppose you could say
we're on a mission of exploration.

03:14.561 --> 03:18.772
From what I'm told, Vulcans aren't
that interested in exploring.

03:18.980 --> 03:21.483
We're not typical Vulcans.

03:21.691 --> 03:26.194
I'd be happy to explain,
but first I'd like to ask a favour.

03:27.737 --> 03:28.945
Certainly.

03:29.154 --> 03:32.657
Our propulsion and life support
systems are in need of repair.

03:32.865 --> 03:36.409
We'd be grateful for
any assistance you could ofer.

03:36.618 --> 03:38.286
We'll see what we can do.

03:48.919 --> 03:51.420
We've noticed the High Command
looking over our shoulders

03:51.629 --> 03:54.631
- on several occasions as well.
- That's good to know.

03:54.839 --> 03:58.342
I was starting to think
they'd singled us out.

03:59.926 --> 04:04.346
Our chef's had a lot of experience
lately preparing Vulcan dishes.

04:04.554 --> 04:07.139
T'Pol says he's gotten
pretty good at it.

04:08.098 --> 04:11.267
- What is that?
- Oh, it's called chicken.

04:12.518 --> 04:14.561
May I?

04:15.854 --> 04:17.646
Of course.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.485
It's...

04:23.693 --> 04:24.860
...meat, you know.

04:25.110 --> 04:27.737
It looks delicious.

04:33.325 --> 04:35.951
So when did you leave Vulcan?

04:36.994 --> 04:38.286
Eight years ago.

04:38.494 --> 04:39.871
And in those eight years,

04:40.079 --> 04:44.999
we've experienced more than
most Vulcans will in their lifetime.

04:45.207 --> 04:47.126
You said you were explorers?

04:47.335 --> 04:52.087
Yes, but it's not space
we're exploring. It's ourselves.

04:57.050 --> 04:59.676
You're V'tosh ka'tur.

05:00.260 --> 05:01.511
I'm sorry?

05:01.970 --> 05:04.013
"Vulcans without logic."

05:04.263 --> 05:06.764
It's a name the Elders give
to anyone who disagrees

05:06.973 --> 05:11.810
with the ancestral teachings,
but it's not entirely accurate.

05:12.019 --> 05:14.103
We haven't abandoned logic.

05:14.312 --> 05:15.979
We've simply learned to exist

05:16.187 --> 05:19.648
without the need to continually
repress our emotions.

05:19.898 --> 05:22.318
It's taken years of experimentation,

05:22.568 --> 05:26.153
but we've managed to find
a balance between the two.

05:26.403 --> 05:27.863
That's not possible.

05:28.113 --> 05:30.197
Here we are.

05:30.656 --> 05:34.743
Logic is an essential part
of Vulcan existence.

05:35.493 --> 05:38.871
But it has to complement emotions,
not exclude them.

05:39.079 --> 05:41.664
You must know a great deal
about emotion.

05:41.873 --> 05:43.832
You live on a human starship.

05:44.040 --> 05:47.585
That's not something that many
Vulcans would be comfortable with.

05:47.835 --> 05:49.628
I am here as an observer.

05:50.378 --> 05:51.796
I'm sorry.

05:52.005 --> 05:53.464
I didn't mean to offend you.

05:54.006 --> 05:57.425
I'm not capable of feeling offence.

05:58.759 --> 06:03.596
My chief engineer tells me your repairs
are gonna take three or four days.

06:03.805 --> 06:06.306
We were going to use that time
to explore the nebula

06:06.515 --> 06:09.475
if you don't mind tagging along.

06:10.309 --> 06:12.519
Not at all.

06:20.775 --> 06:23.443
I've never seen an engine
this far gone.

06:23.652 --> 06:27.154
We're gonna have to swap out
every plasma relay in your reactor.

06:27.363 --> 06:30.282
There are a lot of women
on your ship.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.950
Yeah, nearly a third of the crew.

06:33.158 --> 06:37.078
Is it true you mate year-round,
with any of them you choose?

06:37.787 --> 06:39.830
You haven't been around humans
too much, have you?

06:40.080 --> 06:43.833
You are the first we've met,
but I've heard a lot of stories.

06:44.083 --> 06:47.085
Your people indulge their passions.

06:47.293 --> 06:50.212
Do you really eat six meals a day?

06:50.838 --> 06:53.047
More like three.

06:53.256 --> 06:54.549
And what about sleep?

06:54.757 --> 06:57.759
I understand you spend
more than half the day in bed.

06:57.968 --> 07:00.803
Eight hours.
We sleep for eight hours.

07:01.011 --> 07:03.346
In my case, about six.

07:03.555 --> 07:05.807
When we're through here,
maybe we can get a bite to eat.

07:06.015 --> 07:09.059
I might be able to clear up
some of your...

07:10.476 --> 07:12.353
...misconceptions.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.854
I'd like that, commander.

07:15.897 --> 07:18.107
Call me Trip.

07:19.274 --> 07:21.275
They've asked for any
medical supplies we can spare

07:21.484 --> 07:23.860
and 1,000 litres of plasma coolant.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.987
Well, that shouldn't be a problem.

07:26.238 --> 07:30.949
Tavin has also requested
the recipe for chicken marsala.

07:31.825 --> 07:35.035
Tell him chef's recipes
are usually classified,

07:35.244 --> 07:39.372
but we'll make
an exception in this case.

07:40.956 --> 07:45.292
I thought you'd be spending a little
more time getting to know our guests.

07:46.001 --> 07:48.378
I've been busy.

07:49.045 --> 07:52.923
It seems to me like you've
been busy avoiding them.

07:54.216 --> 07:58.718
I can understand that you might not
approve of what they're trying to do.

07:58.927 --> 08:03.305
But for all we know,
they're onto something.

08:03.931 --> 08:04.972
That's unlikely.

08:05.932 --> 08:07.642
Is it?

08:07.850 --> 08:09.601
Eight years.

08:10.644 --> 08:12.019
That's a pretty good track record.

08:12.269 --> 08:13.979
Just because they smile
and eat chicken

08:14.188 --> 08:17.732
doesn't mean they've learned
to master their emotions.

08:18.982 --> 08:21.235
Maybe I'm just relieved
to finally meet some Vulcans

08:21.443 --> 08:24.070
who aren't giving me a hard time.

08:24.278 --> 08:26.363
Then again...

08:27.030 --> 08:28.948
...if they have found this balance...

08:29.156 --> 08:32.201
They're not the first ones
to attempt this, captain.

08:32.408 --> 08:35.244
Others have tried
to reintegrate their emotions.

08:35.453 --> 08:37.746
They all failed.

08:38.538 --> 08:41.539
What they're doing is dangerous.

08:42.249 --> 08:43.582
Unless my instincts are way off,

08:43.792 --> 08:45.710
they don't seem
very dangerous to me.

08:45.919 --> 08:48.253
But I could be wrong.

08:49.670 --> 08:53.007
I can't order you
to spend time with them,

08:53.215 --> 08:56.218
but I would encourage you
to keep an open mind.

09:21.401 --> 09:23.403
So this is the mess hall.

09:24.403 --> 09:26.572
It is.

09:27.364 --> 09:30.575
The crew must not have
much of an appetite.

09:31.450 --> 09:35.161
Most of them are asleep.
It's quite late.

09:38.747 --> 09:41.333
Could you show me
how to operate this?

09:45.084 --> 09:48.046
- What would you like?
- I'm not sure.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.465
I don't have much experience
with human food.

09:53.257 --> 09:55.009
What's that?

09:55.592 --> 09:58.470
- Mint tea.
- That will be fine.

10:07.392 --> 10:09.935
Mint tea, hot.

10:19.817 --> 10:21.777
Thank you.

10:26.072 --> 10:27.656
It has a lot of flavour.

10:27.906 --> 10:32.243
- You can try something else.
- No, it's fine. I'm just surprised.

10:33.201 --> 10:34.619
Do you like the taste?

10:35.078 --> 10:38.372
Their selection of Vulcan
beverages is limited.

10:38.622 --> 10:40.790
But it can make Vulcan tea?

10:40.999 --> 10:42.625
Yes.

10:43.334 --> 10:44.835
Interesting.

10:45.919 --> 10:48.880
Unless you need further
assistance...

10:50.964 --> 10:53.758
How long have you lived
among humans?

10:59.762 --> 11:03.098
I spent two years
at the Vulcan Consulate on Earth

11:03.307 --> 11:05.766
and seven months on Enterprise.

11:06.017 --> 11:08.268
That's a long time away from home.

11:08.476 --> 11:11.603
Living here has obviously affected you
in ways that you don't realize.

11:12.146 --> 11:13.897
You may be right.

11:14.106 --> 11:17.025
On occasion,
I also drink chamomile tea.

11:17.650 --> 11:19.568
And you have a sense of humour.

11:19.776 --> 11:22.778
A concept that most Vulcans
can't seem to grasp.

11:23.028 --> 11:24.904
You're easily amused.

11:25.113 --> 11:26.448
There's the humour again.

11:27.115 --> 11:29.032
I'm curious.

11:29.241 --> 11:30.659
Why do you stay here?

11:30.909 --> 11:33.077
Captain Archer
needs a science officer.

11:33.870 --> 11:35.662
Is that the only reason?

11:35.871 --> 11:38.706
Maybe you're more attached to these
people than you care to admit.

11:38.956 --> 11:40.249
What makes you say that?

11:40.499 --> 11:43.293
Your emotions are much closer
to the surface than other Vulcans.

11:43.501 --> 11:44.544
They're easier to read.

11:44.752 --> 11:48.005
I have yet to meditate this evening.
Perhaps that's what you're sensing.

11:48.213 --> 11:51.048
This may surprise you,
but we still meditate.

11:51.257 --> 11:55.176
The balance between emotion
and logic requires constant discipline.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.803
So you've said.

11:59.054 --> 12:02.181
You and your colleagues
have chosen a reckless path.

12:02.931 --> 12:03.932
Have we?

12:04.141 --> 12:07.143
History's shown that Vulcans
who attempt to embrace their emotions

12:07.351 --> 12:09.520
often revert to their primal nature.

12:09.727 --> 12:14.147
That's a myth. Propaganda
from 5,000 years ago.

12:14.356 --> 12:19.819
Our primal nature, T'Pol,
is not as dangerous as you think.

12:21.111 --> 12:26.281
Commander Tucker suggested
I try something called "pizza."

12:26.490 --> 12:27.699
Would you care to join me?

12:28.574 --> 12:30.326
I've already eaten.

12:36.622 --> 12:38.706
Another time, perhaps.

12:58.262 --> 13:00.681
Is it what you imagined, sir?

13:00.889 --> 13:03.557
Pictures don't do it justice.

13:03.766 --> 13:07.602
It's big. Over 8 billion
kilometres in diameter.

13:07.852 --> 13:10.896
Eight billion? Are you sure?

13:11.105 --> 13:13.147
According to sensors.

13:13.773 --> 13:17.067
My astronomy book said
it was only 6 and a half.

13:17.317 --> 13:19.235
We'll have to send
our readings to the publisher

13:19.443 --> 13:21.445
so they can put out a revised edition.

13:22.445 --> 13:25.532
How long would it take
to chart that thing?

13:25.739 --> 13:27.241
Several weeks.

13:27.449 --> 13:30.618
My vessel is equipped
with translinear sensors.

13:30.826 --> 13:35.705
We could help you complete
the survey a good deal quicker.

13:36.872 --> 13:40.959
We should have someone
on your ship to monitor the data.

13:41.167 --> 13:43.794
Would you mind working
from there?

13:45.337 --> 13:47.129
No.

13:48.839 --> 13:50.924
Glad you dropped by.

13:51.132 --> 13:53.509
Take us in, Travis.

14:00.388 --> 14:02.057
Look at that.

14:02.307 --> 14:05.017
I've never seen anything
so beautiful.

14:05.226 --> 14:08.645
You probably consider that
an emotional reaction.

14:08.853 --> 14:10.771
Not necessarily.

14:10.979 --> 14:13.357
It is aesthetically pleasing.

14:13.565 --> 14:15.149
"Pleasing."

14:15.358 --> 14:18.777
Coming from you,
that's practically an outburst.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.284
It's curious that people
who reject Surak's teachings

14:29.493 --> 14:30.952
would display his likeness.

14:31.202 --> 14:33.454
We don't reject his teachings.

14:33.662 --> 14:36.289
We simply disagree
with how they're interpreted.

14:37.165 --> 14:39.917
Have you read his original text?

14:40.125 --> 14:43.503
He never intended for us
to purge our emotions.

14:43.711 --> 14:45.212
He wanted us to master them,

14:45.420 --> 14:47.964
and then carefully integrate them
into our lives.

14:48.173 --> 14:52.800
- I doubt many would agree with you.
- That doesn't mean we're wrong.

14:53.509 --> 14:55.594
What did you do on Vulcan
before you left?

14:55.969 --> 14:58.846
I taught literature
at the Shirkar Academy.

14:59.430 --> 15:02.557
You gave up a great deal
to wander the galaxy in a transport.

15:03.808 --> 15:05.518
I don't have any regrets.

15:05.726 --> 15:07.353
I always knew there
had to be more to life

15:07.561 --> 15:09.896
than just logic and reason.

15:10.354 --> 15:12.606
Haven't you ever felt that way?

15:12.814 --> 15:14.608
Not recently.

15:15.192 --> 15:17.610
But you did once?

15:20.445 --> 15:22.071
Once.

15:24.573 --> 15:26.908
I should take these readings
back to Enterprise.

15:27.116 --> 15:28.951
T'Pol.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.912
You said that you meditated
each night.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.163
Tonight don't.

15:34.371 --> 15:36.165
See what happens.

15:36.415 --> 15:39.125
I think you'll find your dreams
will be far more interesting.

15:41.084 --> 15:42.502
You're a scientist.

15:43.128 --> 15:45.629
Consider it an experiment.

15:52.676 --> 15:53.968
Where did you hear that?

15:54.177 --> 15:56.471
A Vulcan anthropologist
told me he'd seen the ritual

15:56.679 --> 15:59.222
during an Earth expedition.

15:59.431 --> 16:01.682
They're not trying to kill
the quarterback.

16:01.891 --> 16:05.351
They're just trying to keep him from
throwing the ball or running with it.

16:05.560 --> 16:09.271
It's only a game,
not a fight to the death.

16:09.479 --> 16:11.272
I see.

16:11.480 --> 16:13.274
You must think
we're a bunch of barbarians.

16:13.482 --> 16:15.358
Your species does have
a reputation,

16:15.567 --> 16:19.194
but I've always suspected
the stories were exaggerated.

16:19.403 --> 16:23.281
Well, I hope you'll tell all your friends.
Set the record straight.

16:23.990 --> 16:25.949
Gladly.

16:27.951 --> 16:31.870
There's something I've always
wondered about Vulcans.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.997
Maybe you could clear it up for me.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.707
Please.

16:36.915 --> 16:40.543
- It's kind of personal.
- Go ahead.

16:41.836 --> 16:44.004
I've learned about
your marriage customs.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.130
How your parents arrange
the whole thing

16:46.380 --> 16:48.465
when you're young,
stuff like that.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.968
But what about...?

16:53.552 --> 16:55.137
You know.

16:55.887 --> 16:58.139
You mean sex.

17:03.308 --> 17:05.894
It's not a topic
I've heard Vulcans discuss.

17:06.145 --> 17:09.480
Well, we do have it,
if that's what you're asking.

17:10.521 --> 17:12.315
Am I interrupting anything?

17:12.566 --> 17:14.150
No, please join us, Mr...?

17:14.400 --> 17:17.569
- Reed. Malcolm Reed.
- Kov.

17:17.777 --> 17:21.738
We were just discussing
Vulcan mating rituals.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.116
Most of my people
are extremely uncomfortable

17:25.324 --> 17:28.743
talking about such things.
So many inhibitions.

17:28.952 --> 17:31.954
Vulcan males are driven to mate
once every seven years.

17:32.705 --> 17:35.206
- Seven years?
- Frightening.

17:35.415 --> 17:36.416
Over the past few years,

17:36.666 --> 17:40.502
we've been developing methods
to accelerate the mating cycle.

17:42.712 --> 17:44.046
You up for seconds?

17:44.754 --> 17:47.048
I've had enough, thank you.

17:48.757 --> 17:50.384
Back to work?

17:51.009 --> 17:54.678
- A pleasure meeting you, Mr Reed.
- Likewise.

18:02.684 --> 18:06.395
Sir, I'm picking up a transmission
from Echo III.

18:06.603 --> 18:09.522
- Starfleet?
- It's Admiral Forrest.

18:11.023 --> 18:13.650
I'll take it in my Ready Room.

18:24.825 --> 18:28.953
- Admiral Forrest, good to see you.
- You too, Jon.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.663
I understand you have guests.

18:31.871 --> 18:34.915
A Vulcan crew. How did you know?

18:35.332 --> 18:38.167
I got a call from Ambassador Soval
about an hour ago.

18:38.417 --> 18:41.711
They're aware that you've docked
with the Vahklas,

18:42.045 --> 18:43.921
and they have a favour to ask.

18:44.129 --> 18:45.381
A favour from me?

18:45.631 --> 18:48.591
A minister at the High Command
has a son on that ship.

18:49.050 --> 18:52.678
An engineer named Kov.
Have you met him?

18:52.886 --> 18:54.178
I don't think so.

18:54.387 --> 18:56.514
Well, apparently the two of them
had a falling out

18:56.722 --> 18:58.556
about nine, ten years ago.

18:58.765 --> 19:01.767
His father's tried to contact him
several times since then

19:01.975 --> 19:04.185
but Kov won't respond.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.770
What do they want me to do?

19:06.020 --> 19:08.688
I hear these aren't
your garden-variety Vulcans.

19:09.356 --> 19:12.233
Can I assume
you're on friendly terms?

19:12.441 --> 19:13.651
Yes.

19:14.275 --> 19:18.737
Kov's father is dying, Jon.
He'd like to speak with his son.

19:18.987 --> 19:22.531
Maybe you can
encourage him somehow.

19:23.199 --> 19:24.658
I'll see what I can do.

19:25.992 --> 19:28.410
The High Command
let you keep your science oficer.

19:29.203 --> 19:31.621
It wouldn't hurt to return the favour.

19:31.829 --> 19:33.081
Understood.

19:33.665 --> 19:35.957
Keep me posted.

19:46.924 --> 19:50.426
Our primal nature isn't
as dangerous as you think.

20:01.059 --> 20:02.893
Do you like the taste?

20:12.317 --> 20:14.777
You must have learned
a great deal about emotion.

20:25.993 --> 20:27.327
Why do you stay here?

21:22.282 --> 21:24.159
This is more
than a simple headache.

21:24.367 --> 21:25.826
Your blood pressure's elevated,

21:26.035 --> 21:30.163
and I'm reading unusually high
synaptic activity.

21:30.371 --> 21:33.915
It doesn't appear to be a virus
or a bacterial infection.

21:34.124 --> 21:36.751
I'd like to run a cranial scan
just to be safe.

21:36.959 --> 21:38.918
That won't be necessary.

21:39.127 --> 21:41.129
It'll only take a moment.

21:41.337 --> 21:45.048
I believe I can explain my symptoms.

21:45.257 --> 21:48.176
Last night I neglected to meditate
before I went to sleep.

21:48.384 --> 21:51.970
As a result, I awoke feeling...

21:52.720 --> 21:54.221
...agitated.

21:56.347 --> 21:58.558
All I need is an injection
of Inoprovalene.

21:58.766 --> 22:01.268
Twenty-five milligrams
should suffice.

22:01.476 --> 22:04.645
Very well, doctor.

22:08.773 --> 22:12.109
It's not like you to stray
from your routine.

22:12.901 --> 22:15.319
This wouldn't have anything
to do with our visitors?

22:15.570 --> 22:18.280
You've been spending
quite a bit of time on their ship.

22:19.197 --> 22:21.157
I've become...

22:21.365 --> 22:24.075
...acquainted with one of them.

22:25.201 --> 22:31.455
He suggested that my dreams might
be more interesting if I didn't meditate.

22:31.664 --> 22:33.457
And?

22:34.874 --> 22:36.668
He was wrong.

22:37.793 --> 22:41.796
They were unsettling.
It was a foolish thing to do.

22:43.297 --> 22:46.550
Nothing that a little
Inoprovalene can't cure.

22:48.384 --> 22:51.178
I can understand why you'd be
intrigued by their philosophy.

22:51.386 --> 22:56.056
Maybe you shouldn't be so quick
to dismiss it after one bad experience.

22:56.890 --> 22:59.433
There are too many risks.

23:00.184 --> 23:03.687
It would be unwise to continue.

23:04.688 --> 23:06.313
You're probably right.

23:06.522 --> 23:09.857
But if you do decide
to experiment further,

23:10.316 --> 23:13.235
keep in mind that they've been
working on this for a number of years.

23:13.485 --> 23:16.028
You've only known them
for two days.

23:16.904 --> 23:18.656
Go slowly.

23:21.032 --> 23:23.617
Thank you, doctor.

23:32.082 --> 23:33.457
Come in.

23:34.458 --> 23:36.251
Captain.

23:36.835 --> 23:38.169
Please have a seat.

23:38.878 --> 23:41.672
The repairs to our propulsion
system are going well.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.173
Mr Tucker's been very helpful.

23:44.382 --> 23:46.217
That's good to hear.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.094
Is there a problem?

23:50.344 --> 23:52.846
I called you here to pass along...

23:53.513 --> 23:55.765
...a message...

23:56.932 --> 23:59.017
...from your father.

24:01.143 --> 24:02.561
You spoke with him?

24:03.270 --> 24:07.107
Actually, it came through
a Vulcan ambassador.

24:07.314 --> 24:11.818
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this,
but your father is very ill.

24:12.443 --> 24:15.821
He wants you to contact him
as soon as possible.

24:17.863 --> 24:23.868
If you'd like, my com officer
can arrange the transmission.

24:24.618 --> 24:29.497
It's a kind offer,
but I'll deal with this myself.

24:31.123 --> 24:32.791
Thanks for the message.

24:33.458 --> 24:34.917
I know it's none of my business,

24:35.125 --> 24:39.003
but do you plan on contacting him?

24:40.129 --> 24:42.172
The last time I spoke with my father,

24:42.381 --> 24:47.718
he said I'd brought shame
to 15 generations of our family.

24:50.220 --> 24:52.721
He's dying, Kov.

24:54.139 --> 24:56.432
If it isn't too much trouble,

24:56.641 --> 24:59.809
would you please send
a message back for me?

25:01.353 --> 25:04.772
Tell him that we said goodbye
a long time ago.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.158
Good morning.

25:21.367 --> 25:23.326
Chamomile?

25:25.912 --> 25:27.204
Thank you.

25:27.412 --> 25:29.164
How did it go?

25:29.790 --> 25:31.540
The lateral sensors
were out of alignment.

25:31.749 --> 25:35.627
I haven't had a chance
to scan the disodium layer.

25:36.628 --> 25:39.046
I mean last night.

25:39.254 --> 25:41.339
Did you take my advice?

25:43.049 --> 25:44.549
Yes.

25:44.758 --> 25:48.552
- And your dreams?
- I'd rather not discuss them.

25:48.761 --> 25:51.012
It will get easier.

25:51.220 --> 25:54.098
Tonight will be less disturbing.

25:54.306 --> 25:57.892
- I plan to resume meditating tonight.
- You can't give up after one try.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.769
It was a mistake to try
in the first place.

25:59.977 --> 26:02.979
Wasn't there anything enjoyable
about the experience?

26:03.188 --> 26:06.231
I'm reading over 20 million
cubic meters of disodium,

26:06.440 --> 26:07.982
as well as traces of ethylchlorate.

26:08.357 --> 26:11.610
We can run the scans later.

26:12.444 --> 26:14.571
Tell me about your dreams.

26:14.779 --> 26:17.740
Your emotions were closer
to the surface.

26:17.948 --> 26:20.533
It must have been intense.

26:23.744 --> 26:26.162
It involved a memory.

26:27.038 --> 26:31.041
I was walking down a street
in San Francisco.

26:31.833 --> 26:33.083
On Earth.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.752
Why did you leave the compound?

26:36.753 --> 26:41.631
I was curious about human recreation.
I wanted to see it for myself.

26:41.840 --> 26:44.467
So you broke protocol?

26:45.760 --> 26:46.926
It was late.

26:47.135 --> 26:50.429
Everyone in the compound
had gone to sleep.

26:51.138 --> 26:54.140
I didn't see any harm in leaving
for a couple of hours.

26:54.348 --> 26:56.308
Where did you go?

26:56.892 --> 26:59.311
I simply walked.

27:00.436 --> 27:03.479
- Then I heard music.
- Music?

27:06.857 --> 27:08.900
It was unusual.

27:09.109 --> 27:11.193
Chaotic.

27:11.902 --> 27:15.697
- But I was drawn to it.
- Go on.

27:17.823 --> 27:20.242
I went into a restaurant

27:20.908 --> 27:24.703
where musicians were playing.
I sat at a table.

27:25.328 --> 27:27.663
How did you feel?

27:30.332 --> 27:33.126
- I can't remember.
- Try.

27:38.254 --> 27:40.464
I felt...

27:42.007 --> 27:43.550
...invigorated.

27:44.550 --> 27:48.636
Emotion. You felt emotion.

27:51.222 --> 27:53.306
Briefly.

27:53.515 --> 27:56.225
They finished playing
and I returned to the compound.

27:56.434 --> 27:58.601
You could feel that way again, T'Pol.

27:58.810 --> 28:02.438
It isn't difficult,
and it's nothing to be afraid of.

28:02.646 --> 28:04.982
I can show you how.

28:08.817 --> 28:10.569
You want me to talk to him?

28:10.777 --> 28:13.487
From what I hear,
you've become fast friends.

28:13.696 --> 28:16.114
Maybe you'll have better luck
than I did.

28:16.322 --> 28:21.410
I'll try, but something tells me it won't
be as simple as fixing an engine.

28:21.618 --> 28:23.619
He's got a lot of resentment.

28:23.828 --> 28:26.538
- Do your best.
- Aye, sir.

28:27.789 --> 28:30.457
What about this Tolaris fellow?

28:30.666 --> 28:33.167
Well, I haven't really gotten
to know him.

28:33.376 --> 28:34.961
He seems kind of quiet though.

28:35.169 --> 28:36.753
A little sullen.

28:36.962 --> 28:39.839
T'Pol's been spending
a lot of time with him lately.

28:40.047 --> 28:41.966
Is that a problem?

28:42.174 --> 28:46.511
Two days ago, she couldn't wait
to get these people off the ship.

28:46.718 --> 28:49.179
I practically had to order her
to work with them.

28:49.388 --> 28:53.224
Now, they're almost inseparable.

28:53.432 --> 28:57.017
Well, if I didn't know better,
I'd say you were a little jealous.

28:57.851 --> 29:00.271
If I was the only human
on a ship full of Vulcans,

29:00.478 --> 29:02.313
and we ran into an Earth vessel,

29:02.522 --> 29:05.232
I'd be spending as much time
with them as I could.

29:05.440 --> 29:08.109
She likes being around
her own kind.

29:08.818 --> 29:10.611
Who doesn't?

29:13.029 --> 29:14.780
Well, let me know
how it goes with Kov.

29:14.988 --> 29:16.657
Yes, sir.

29:21.785 --> 29:23.453
"Mind meld"?

29:23.662 --> 29:25.621
It's an ancient technique.

29:25.830 --> 29:27.790
It was abandoned centuries ago.

29:27.997 --> 29:32.000
But we've discovered that
it can help us access our emotions.

29:32.209 --> 29:33.418
How does it work?

29:33.627 --> 29:36.796
I'd begin by creating
a telepathic link.

29:37.004 --> 29:40.799
We would be able to share
our memories, our thoughts.

29:41.007 --> 29:44.802
In essence, we would
become one mind.

29:45.010 --> 29:50.597
It's quite an experience,
but it is profoundly intimate.

29:51.765 --> 29:53.307
Are you prepared for that?

29:55.142 --> 29:59.645
If you like, we could try a more
traditional form of guided meditation.

29:59.853 --> 30:02.064
But it wouldn't be nearly
as effective.

30:04.273 --> 30:05.733
Proceed.

30:12.071 --> 30:13.780
It's all right.

30:14.572 --> 30:16.657
Close your eyes.

30:16.865 --> 30:19.825
Try to focus on my voice.

30:21.327 --> 30:24.162
My mind to your mind.

30:25.330 --> 30:28.707
Your thoughts to my thoughts.

30:29.375 --> 30:33.960
Our minds are merging,
our minds are becoming one.

30:37.171 --> 30:39.465
It's not working.

30:40.090 --> 30:41.716
You're resisting.

30:41.925 --> 30:44.176
Relax.

30:47.845 --> 30:50.556
My mind to your mind.

30:51.348 --> 30:54.683
Your thoughts to my thoughts.

30:55.059 --> 30:57.603
Our minds are merging.

30:59.187 --> 31:01.938
Our minds are becoming one.

31:04.774 --> 31:06.067
Am I with you?

31:07.318 --> 31:08.526
Yes.

31:08.777 --> 31:10.570
Can you sense my thoughts?

31:12.196 --> 31:13.697
Yes.

31:15.031 --> 31:17.074
You're doing well.

31:17.992 --> 31:22.328
I want you to think about that night
when you left the compound.

31:22.870 --> 31:26.247
Imagine yourself
walking down that street.

31:32.835 --> 31:34.837
Good.

31:35.546 --> 31:36.755
Now listen.

31:37.172 --> 31:39.548
Can you hear the music?

31:41.425 --> 31:43.509
Listen.

31:45.094 --> 31:47.220
Now follow it.

32:02.106 --> 32:05.609
I can see why
you were drawn to this place.

32:06.026 --> 32:08.903
It's unlike anything on Vulcan.

32:09.111 --> 32:12.530
I'm not surprised it triggered
an emotional response.

32:13.989 --> 32:17.533
You said you were invigorated.
What else?

32:18.534 --> 32:20.785
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

32:20.994 --> 32:23.872
You're just not used
to describing your emotions.

32:24.079 --> 32:26.540
You experienced other things.

32:26.749 --> 32:29.959
Excitement about breaking protocol.

32:30.168 --> 32:32.794
Apprehension about getting caught.

32:33.003 --> 32:34.712
And the music.

32:34.920 --> 32:38.965
The music made you feel elated.

32:39.174 --> 32:42.634
Allow yourself to feel
these emotions again.

32:43.552 --> 32:45.511
Don't hold them back.

32:47.513 --> 32:49.806
I have to return to the compound.

32:50.015 --> 32:53.434
You're anxious.
It's just another emotion.

32:53.684 --> 32:55.977
- Let me go.
- Stay with me, T'Pol.

32:56.227 --> 32:58.062
No!

32:59.855 --> 33:01.815
Stop.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.400
No.

33:11.864 --> 33:13.948
Stop!

33:15.575 --> 33:17.075
This was a mistake.

33:17.325 --> 33:19.243
You've made progress.

33:19.451 --> 33:21.829
Don't give up now.

33:22.037 --> 33:23.955
- Please go.
- T'Pol.

33:24.205 --> 33:25.582
Leave.

33:25.832 --> 33:27.666
You're feeling anger.

33:27.874 --> 33:30.418
Your emotions
are breaking the surface.

33:31.168 --> 33:33.420
Embrace them.

33:44.386 --> 33:46.388
What a shame.

34:19.828 --> 34:21.870
T'Pol to Sickbay.

34:28.333 --> 34:31.210
I've already been through this
with your captain.

34:31.418 --> 34:33.879
Are you sure you're making
the right decision?

34:34.088 --> 34:35.964
If you knew my father,
you'd understand.

34:36.172 --> 34:38.007
I don't mean to put too fine
a point on this,

34:38.216 --> 34:40.717
but you've got a limited window
of opportunity.

34:40.926 --> 34:43.719
- Once it closes...
- I consider you a friend, Trip,

34:43.928 --> 34:46.346
and I appreciate what you're trying
to do, but please don't.

34:46.596 --> 34:49.181
I have no intention
of contacting him.

34:50.264 --> 34:54.893
I test-fired our port thruster last night.
It's still off by 12 percent.

34:55.103 --> 34:58.814
Well, probably a faulty injector.
Should be easy enough to fix.

35:08.904 --> 35:11.197
Do Vulcans dance?

35:13.365 --> 35:15.158
You know:

35:16.700 --> 35:17.701
No.

35:17.910 --> 35:21.371
Only when it's part
of some tedious ceremony.

35:21.579 --> 35:23.622
I remember the first dance
I ever went to.

35:24.331 --> 35:28.876
Bayshore Elementary,
Panama City, Florida.

35:29.085 --> 35:32.128
The girl I had a crush on,
Melissa Lyles,

35:32.337 --> 35:34.505
was gonna be there.

35:34.713 --> 35:37.965
So I spent weeks practicing
the two-step with my brother.

35:38.174 --> 35:41.885
I wanted to make sure I was ready.

35:42.886 --> 35:47.931
She was wearing a red dress
that night. Prettiest girl there.

35:49.808 --> 35:53.644
All I wanted to do was ask her
to dance with me,

35:53.852 --> 35:56.771
but I never worked up the courage
to go over and talk to her.

35:57.647 --> 36:00.690
Caught her looking at me
a couple of times, but...

36:02.107 --> 36:07.278
...I ended up just standing
in a corner with my buddies.

36:11.655 --> 36:13.115
Interesting.

36:13.324 --> 36:16.618
But what does that have to do
with our thruster problem?

36:17.786 --> 36:20.579
It's been more than 20 years...

36:21.330 --> 36:24.749
...and I'm still kicking myself
for not asking that girl to dance.

36:25.291 --> 36:27.626
You probably don't know this,

36:27.834 --> 36:30.461
but regret is one
of the strongest emotions,

36:30.711 --> 36:34.088
and one of the saddest.

36:35.131 --> 36:38.175
I have a feeling you haven't had
a brush with it yet.

36:38.383 --> 36:42.677
But it sounds to me like
you're pretty close.

36:46.555 --> 36:48.849
That's something you might
want to avoid.

36:58.105 --> 36:59.939
Come in.

37:05.027 --> 37:06.361
Good morning.

37:07.320 --> 37:09.071
Morning.

37:09.280 --> 37:13.158
- Can I get you something? Coffee?
- No, thanks.

37:13.408 --> 37:15.200
Have a seat.

37:16.827 --> 37:19.412
Trip tells me the repairs to your ship
are almost finished.

37:19.621 --> 37:21.330
You should be on your way
pretty soon.

37:21.538 --> 37:24.790
- Yes.
- How's that survey coming along?

37:24.999 --> 37:26.417
We'll be done this afternoon.

37:27.084 --> 37:28.960
That's great news.

37:29.753 --> 37:31.962
I wanted to thank you
for all of your help.

37:32.171 --> 37:33.380
It was the least we could do.

37:33.630 --> 37:36.048
Besides, we've enjoyed
spending our time here.

37:36.257 --> 37:38.550
You have an exceptional crew,
captain.

37:38.759 --> 37:40.802
Starfleet's finest.

37:41.011 --> 37:42.428
Sleep well last night?

37:43.471 --> 37:45.471
Well enough. You?

37:46.264 --> 37:47.807
Tossed and turned.

37:48.016 --> 37:51.601
Always happens whenever
we're exploring someplace new.

37:51.851 --> 37:53.895
I understand.

37:54.103 --> 37:58.356
Well, if there's nothing more, captain,
I'm eager to get back to work.

37:58.564 --> 38:02.483
We have another 20 million
cubic kilometres to chart.

38:02.692 --> 38:04.360
Sorry to keep you.

38:05.278 --> 38:09.363
I'm afraid you'll be
working alone today.

38:11.365 --> 38:14.701
Sub-commander T'Pol's in Sickbay.

38:14.909 --> 38:17.870
From what the doctor tells me,
she's in pretty bad shape.

38:18.871 --> 38:21.164
That's unfortunate.
What happened?

38:21.873 --> 38:24.541
You know damn well
what happened.

38:24.749 --> 38:29.627
She told me about your...
What'd she call it? Mind meld?

38:30.628 --> 38:33.922
She said when she asked you
to stop, you got angry.

38:34.506 --> 38:37.133
She said she had to force you away.

38:37.341 --> 38:40.677
What happened between us
is personal.

38:40.885 --> 38:44.304
- It's not your concern.
- You assaulted a member of my crew.

38:44.513 --> 38:45.681
I did no such thing.

38:46.390 --> 38:49.142
Mind melds can be
emotionally turbulent.

38:49.726 --> 38:53.311
- She simply panicked.
- Panic doesn't land you in Sickbay.

38:54.186 --> 38:57.272
Our doctor said she could have
suffered neurological damage

38:57.480 --> 39:00.358
- thanks to you.
- No one forced her to try the meld.

39:00.567 --> 39:01.567
She did it willingly.

39:01.817 --> 39:04.068
You've been manipulating her
ever since you came aboard.

39:04.318 --> 39:07.321
I am helping her shed
a lifetime of repression,

39:07.529 --> 39:10.948
and you of all people should
understand what I'm trying to do.

39:11.365 --> 39:12.992
You're human.

39:13.659 --> 39:16.869
- I need to go see her.
- T'Pol's had enough of your help.

39:17.078 --> 39:18.370
Stay away from her.

39:18.620 --> 39:21.039
She is in a crucial stage
of her awakening.

39:21.248 --> 39:24.667
- She needs guidance.
- I told you, it's over.

39:24.874 --> 39:26.167
I think that's for her to decide.

39:26.418 --> 39:30.170
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.
Sickbay's off-limits.

39:30.421 --> 39:32.463
You're in my way, captain.

39:32.672 --> 39:34.382
You'd be wise to let me leave.

39:34.590 --> 39:37.926
What's wrong, Tolaris?
Getting angry?

39:38.135 --> 39:40.344
Thought you had that under control.

39:40.553 --> 39:41.887
Move aside.

39:42.470 --> 39:44.222
T'Pol's right.

39:44.430 --> 39:46.348
You've got a temper.

39:46.557 --> 39:48.975
- Now.
- Go to hell.

40:04.778 --> 40:06.570
You planned this.

40:06.779 --> 40:10.448
If I'd known I was gonna get thrown
across the room that hard...

40:11.116 --> 40:13.575
...I might have tried
a different approach.

40:13.784 --> 40:18.913
I think it's time you and your friends
went on your merry way.

40:28.753 --> 40:31.505
Keep an eye on the intermix pressure.
Don't let it drift above 5,000.

40:31.713 --> 40:33.674
- Five thousand.
- And watch those injector ports.

40:33.881 --> 40:35.549
I will.

40:36.550 --> 40:39.302
I thought you'd like to know,
I got an update on my father.

40:39.678 --> 40:41.720
Apparently, his condition's improved.

40:41.970 --> 40:43.055
Is that so?

40:43.263 --> 40:45.431
The surgeons implanted
a vaso-stimulator.

40:45.640 --> 40:49.101
They say with any luck,
it will extend his life a few years.

40:49.893 --> 40:51.811
I'm glad to hear it.

40:52.019 --> 40:54.729
That will give you a little
more time to think about

40:54.938 --> 40:56.981
making that call.

40:57.940 --> 40:59.816
I already did.

41:00.025 --> 41:03.236
My father's the one who gave me
the good news.

41:04.237 --> 41:06.613
Thank you, Trip.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.365
Anytime.

41:32.298 --> 41:33.965
Come in.

41:37.927 --> 41:39.844
Is this a bad time?

41:40.094 --> 41:41.930
Not at all.

41:48.351 --> 41:50.393
Feeling any better?

41:50.602 --> 41:52.520
Has the Vulcan ship left?

41:54.897 --> 41:56.981
About 20 minutes ago.

41:58.441 --> 42:01.151
Then, yes, I'm feeling better.

42:07.405 --> 42:09.574
You do this every night?

42:09.783 --> 42:11.241
Every night.

42:15.119 --> 42:17.038
I think...

42:18.455 --> 42:20.915
...I finally understand why.

42:24.584 --> 42:26.878
I'll see you in the morning.

42:29.671 --> 42:31.672
Captain.

42:33.507 --> 42:35.925
Do you dream?

42:38.218 --> 42:40.304
Sure.

42:41.554 --> 42:44.931
Sometimes they're even in colour.

42:45.891 --> 42:48.642
Is it enjoyable?

42:49.518 --> 42:51.562
Most nights.

42:52.312 --> 42:53.855
I envy you.

43:00.318 --> 43:03.194
Good night.
