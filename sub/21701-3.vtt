WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.533
Ding-dong! We are back!

00:11.600 --> 00:15.900
This time things are going to be
pure crazy!

00:19.567 --> 00:21.167
Let's get fucking mortal.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.533
Yes!

00:25.600 --> 00:26.967
Fuck off.
Divvy.

00:27.867 --> 00:28.933
Yes!

00:31.367 --> 00:34.433
We're going to be the radgiest
we have ever been.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.433
What the hell?

00:41.900 --> 00:43.733
Ah, fucking yessa!

00:44.900 --> 00:46.033
Ah!
(laughs)

00:46.100 --> 00:49.667
Fucking mug! It's going to be
the maddest of mad tings.

00:49.733 --> 00:50.900
Fucking cunt!

00:53.367 --> 00:54.567
Oh, my God.

00:56.533 --> 00:57.900
This is amazing!

00:59.000 --> 01:02.100
One big fucked-up family.

01:02.167 --> 01:04.967
Cheers!
(they laugh)

01:06.200 --> 01:07.567
Here, I'm in pain.

01:07.633 --> 01:11.200
First Gaz doesn't show,
then Aaron takes off, and now
Scott.

01:11.267 --> 01:13.300
What is going on in this house?

01:14.967 --> 01:17.667
This neck on is what I need
to get over Scott.

01:17.733 --> 01:21.833
I might actually come down.
Come down and take us for some
food.

01:21.900 --> 01:24.100
I won't find a lad who can match
up.

01:26.333 --> 01:28.967
Chloe, when are you going to
start
being honest?

01:30.067 --> 01:31.967
Chloe has gone fucking akka.

01:33.767 --> 01:37.833
I can't stay in this house.
I'm going home.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.200
I should have a degree in
pulling.

01:42.267 --> 01:44.833
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.300
Get me in.
I'm going to tear the place up.

01:47.367 --> 01:50.567
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

01:50.633 --> 01:55.367
I'm preened to perfection.
I'm totally crackers me, like.

01:55.433 --> 01:57.633
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.600
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:00.667 --> 02:04.133
My quiff is pure lethal
and my banter is pure naughty.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.933
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:17.300 --> 02:18.833
I've woken up super early

02:18.900 --> 02:21.300
because I want to see Aaron
before his fight.

02:21.367 --> 02:24.667
I didn't feel like I got the
chance
to wish him good luck.

02:29.067 --> 02:30.467
Morning!
Shut up.

02:30.533 --> 02:35.367
This morning I've woke up
and I'm fucking ill today. Hoo.

02:35.433 --> 02:38.700
What the fuck went on last night
when we got back?

02:38.767 --> 02:41.933
Me and Chloe got back
and she just wanted to go home.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.567
Chloe went fucking akka last
night.

02:44.633 --> 02:47.533
She thought everyone
was ganging up on her.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.767
She was mortal, though.
I just want to get her back
ASAP.

02:50.833 --> 02:52.967
I feel like
I want you to sort it out.

02:53.033 --> 02:56.433
I will go out with her
when she's sober.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.567
When it comes to Chloe and
Martin,

02:58.633 --> 03:02.033
it's better to take a step back
and let them just crack on.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.667
Otherwise we're going to end up
arguing.

03:04.733 --> 03:07.100
You're not as bad
as I thought you were.

03:07.167 --> 03:08.233
I'm a nice person.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.633
Hiya!
All right?

03:14.700 --> 03:16.300
It's good to see Marnie.

03:16.367 --> 03:19.733
Being away has made us realise
how much I'm missing her.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.200
You missed us?
Mm-hmm.

03:21.267 --> 03:23.367
Have you or not?
I actually have.

03:23.433 --> 03:26.233
It's just not the same
in the house without Aaron.

03:26.300 --> 03:29.833
Though the others have been
there,
I've felt lonely.

03:29.900 --> 03:32.033
All of us are so excited.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.867
Are you nervous?
Yeah.

03:33.933 --> 03:35.167
Are you?
Mm-hmm.

03:35.233 --> 03:36.833
Why?
I don't want you hurt.

03:36.900 --> 03:39.100
Marnie is cute
for worrying about us.

03:39.167 --> 03:41.667
I'm glad she's come
because I've missed her.

03:41.733 --> 03:44.233
I can't wait
for her to see us in the ring.

03:44.300 --> 03:47.100
How's the training?
Good, good, good.

03:47.167 --> 03:49.800
I've got to drink nine litres
of water today.

03:49.867 --> 03:50.933
That'll drown you.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.767
I might as well sit on the
toilet
all day! It's horrible. (laughs)

03:54.833 --> 03:56.500
It's been great seeing Aaron.

03:56.567 --> 03:58.900
And I don't want to go back
without him.

03:58.967 --> 04:02.100
But I know it's going to be
worth it
when he wins his fight.

04:02.167 --> 04:03.767
Come on then.

04:03.833 --> 04:06.367
I'm glad I got to see Marnie
again.

04:06.433 --> 04:08.600
Having her support
means a lot to us.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.600
Right, give us a cuddle!

04:10.667 --> 04:13.267
See you later.
Bye, good luck! You'll smash it.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.067
See you later!
See you later.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.867
Morning, Abbie.
Morning.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.667
Where's Marnie?
God knows.

04:28.733 --> 04:32.567
What was going on last night?
I don't even know.

04:32.633 --> 04:36.933
Chloe kicked off last night
after
me, Marnie and Nathan confronted
her

04:37.000 --> 04:39.233
about what's going on.

04:39.300 --> 04:42.000
We just want Chloe
to be honest and truthful.

04:42.067 --> 04:44.733
I just don't know
what's going on with the girl.

04:48.933 --> 04:50.200
There she is!

04:50.267 --> 04:51.467
How are you?
Good.

04:51.533 --> 04:53.733
Where have you been?
I went to see Aaron.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.900
Did you get a tingle in your
mingle?
Yeah.

04:56.967 --> 05:00.900
Seeing Aaron has made Marnie
happy.
She's got a smile back on her
face.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.833
I just hope that one day them
two
will get together again.

05:04.900 --> 05:07.667
I said, "I miss you.
It's not the same without you."

05:13.733 --> 05:16.867
Even though Chloe went
fucking ballingo last night,

05:16.933 --> 05:19.433
she's my best mate
and I love her to bits.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.067
I'm going to make sure
she's all right.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.700
This morning I've woken up
at my ma's

05:26.767 --> 05:30.233
because I felt like everyone
was ganging up on us. Even
Marty.

05:30.300 --> 05:33.033
I feel embarrassed.
I think I took it too far.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.767
I just want to get back.

05:34.833 --> 05:37.700
Hello?
Oi, oi. You all right?

05:37.767 --> 05:40.033
Yeah, I'm fine.
I've calmed down a bit.

05:40.100 --> 05:43.567
If you want us to pick you up,
we'll do something.

05:43.633 --> 05:45.767
What?
I'll tell you when I get there.

05:45.833 --> 05:46.833
Right, OK.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.833
I'm excited that Marty is
coming.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.200
I cannot wait
to see his quiffy face.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.567
Best get ready.

05:57.767 --> 05:59.067
Oi, oi!

05:59.933 --> 06:02.933
I've picked Chloe up
and I cannot wait to see her
face

06:03.000 --> 06:05.933
when she finds out
what we're doing.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.433
It all confuses me, politics.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.567
Yeah.
I don't understand it.

06:16.633 --> 06:19.133
Marty's gone to Chloe,
Aaron's training,

06:19.200 --> 06:20.967
fuck knows where Gary is

06:21.033 --> 06:23.467
and Scott's left
to get over his back.

06:23.533 --> 06:25.767
I just wish we were
all back together.

06:25.833 --> 06:27.767
I miss Barack Obama.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.500
What's going on?
(all) Ey!

06:31.567 --> 06:33.900
Scotty Turbo T is back in the
mix.

06:33.967 --> 06:38.033
Fighting fit and ready to get
fucking walloped. Have you
missed me?

06:38.100 --> 06:39.733
You're back!
You're back!

06:39.800 --> 06:42.300
Feeling better?
How's your back? Better.

06:42.367 --> 06:45.233
It's good to see Scott.
But since he's been gone,

06:45.300 --> 06:48.633
I've necked on with a lad
and had fun with the girls.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.200
I hope now he's back,
none of that changes.

06:51.267 --> 06:54.867
Where's Marty and Chloe?
Out at the minute. Chloe left.

06:54.933 --> 06:57.467
She smashed the house up.
Not the new house!

07:00.833 --> 07:02.800
Where are we?
You'll find out.

07:02.867 --> 07:05.033
What's that? A scarecrow?
It's you!

07:05.100 --> 07:08.200
I've arrived at this place
and there's loads of plants.

07:08.267 --> 07:11.633
Has Martin took me
to a fucking garden centre?

07:11.700 --> 07:13.267
Where the hell are we?

07:13.333 --> 07:16.467
We're feeding pigs!
Oh, my God!

07:16.533 --> 07:18.367
I love fucking pigs.

07:18.433 --> 07:22.367
I'm so glad Marty brought us
here.
He can be really thoughtful at
times.

07:22.433 --> 07:24.600
Aw, look at the baby one!

07:24.667 --> 07:27.533
Her false tan is a bit like
Abbie's!
(they laugh)

07:27.600 --> 07:29.467
There's sheep. Wanna find them?

07:29.533 --> 07:32.267
I'm excited. Can we go together?

07:32.333 --> 07:35.200
I knew the petting farm
would cheer her up.

07:35.267 --> 07:39.200
But the way she behaves
sometimes,
she's lucky I didn't leave her
here.

07:39.267 --> 07:43.300
Aw, you're such a cute goat.
(moos)

07:43.367 --> 07:48.000
What was the crack last night?
I was having such a good night.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.067
I don't understand what went on.

07:50.133 --> 07:52.967
Like, I can't tell the girls
how I feel about you.

07:53.033 --> 07:55.000
Because I'm confused.

07:55.067 --> 07:56.900
As much as I love Chloe to bits,

07:56.967 --> 08:00.200
I need to be honest about
not having feelings in that way.

08:00.267 --> 08:03.400
Last night I started to feel
like I was in a relationship.

08:03.467 --> 08:07.100
Should I be flirting? What
should
I do? Totally stay away from
you?

08:07.167 --> 08:09.667
I love you to bits as a person,
as a friend now.

08:09.733 --> 08:12.900
I haven't got the feelings
that I did before.

08:12.967 --> 08:16.700
It's hard to hear Marty say
he doesn't have the same
feelings

08:16.767 --> 08:18.267
as he used to have.

08:18.333 --> 08:22.600
I've always hoped that me and
him
could be more than just friends.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.400
You care about your quiff more.

08:24.467 --> 08:26.933
That's been part of my life
since I was two.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.167
I'm glad to see Chloe smiling.

08:29.233 --> 08:31.867
But it's hard for me to tell
her,
as a friend,

08:31.933 --> 08:35.232
that I want nothing more.
But it means we can move on as
pals.

08:35.299 --> 08:36.933
Shall we go, then?
Come on.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.600
The day with Marty
has made me feel better.

08:39.667 --> 08:42.767
I need to get back
and sort things out with the
others.

08:42.832 --> 08:44.667
Come on.

08:49.367 --> 08:51.667
I wish I liked fruit.
Do you not like it?

08:51.733 --> 08:52.833
I don't know why.

08:55.567 --> 08:59.167
I'm nervous about seeing
everyone
after smashing up the house.

08:59.233 --> 09:00.900
At least I've got Marty.

09:00.967 --> 09:03.433
I just hope
that everyone can forgive us.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.433
Oi, oi!
Ah, she's back!

09:06.500 --> 09:08.000
Hi!

09:08.067 --> 09:09.467
About time!
Oi, oi!

09:09.533 --> 09:13.167
We get back and Scott's back.
I am fucking buzzing.

09:13.233 --> 09:16.033
All we need now
is Aaron and Gaz back.

09:16.100 --> 09:18.800
Then the full fucking family
is back together!

09:18.867 --> 09:21.833
I just want to apologise to
everyone
for last night.

09:21.900 --> 09:25.733
But obviously I need to speak
to yous two and you outside.

09:25.800 --> 09:29.867
Chloe wants to chat and I think
it's about time we cleared the
air.

09:29.933 --> 09:32.000
We never wanted you
to feel attacked.

09:32.067 --> 09:34.933
It was more of a case of
we wanted you to be honest.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.333
Me, Sophie and Marnie never had
the intention to make Chloe
upset.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.067
We wanted her to be honest
with herself and us.

09:42.133 --> 09:45.900
I can't tell yous how I feel
because I don't know how I've
felt.

09:45.967 --> 09:50.400
You tell us you don't like him
and then you're flirting with
him.

09:50.467 --> 09:53.267
I enjoy having a flirt with
Marty.
It's natural.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.833
Finally, a little bit of
honesty.

09:55.900 --> 09:58.967
When it comes to them two,
nothing is simple.

09:59.033 --> 10:03.333
I know Chloe does want something
to happen between her and Marty.

10:03.400 --> 10:06.967
So from now, honesty is
the best policy. You promise?

10:07.033 --> 10:08.433
Promise.
Give us a hug.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.933
Nothing says best friends
like a massive group hug.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.433
Chloe, if you kick off again,
you'll be cleaning the house.

10:16.733 --> 10:18.200
I nearly tried to kiss you!

10:18.267 --> 10:20.167
We'll have a good night tonight!

10:22.900 --> 10:26.533
Ow! That's so painful!
(phone rings)

10:26.600 --> 10:29.200
You can get that.
Missed your toes.

10:29.267 --> 10:32.733
Who's ringing? Just as things
are settling, the phone rings.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.967
It can only be one fucking
person.
Anna.

10:36.033 --> 10:40.033
Chloe, phone, Anna.
For me?

10:40.100 --> 10:42.400
Anna wants to speak to Chloe.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.567
You're in trouble,
I can already tell.

10:45.633 --> 10:47.967
"I'm not happy with you."
Sorry.

10:48.033 --> 10:49.733
"I'm disgusted."

10:49.800 --> 10:52.233
"You're on a drinking ban
tonight."
OK.

10:52.300 --> 10:56.000
"Any more of this behaviour
and there'll be consequences."

10:56.067 --> 10:57.200
I understand.

10:57.267 --> 11:01.033
Anna sounds so mad and I know
my behaviour was so out of
order.

11:01.100 --> 11:04.033
But I am gutted I can't get
mortal
with these lot.

11:06.033 --> 11:09.467
What's worse? What she said,
or me holding two dildos?

11:09.533 --> 11:11.933
She said that my behaviour
is disgusting

11:12.000 --> 11:13.733
and I'm on a drinking ban.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.600
(gasps)
You're allowed out.

11:15.667 --> 11:17.933
It's good that Chloe's not
drinking.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.233
We'll get some honesty out of
her
and she won't kick off.

11:21.300 --> 11:23.600
Because I'm done with all that.

11:23.667 --> 11:26.767
I'm going to go
and carry on what I started.

11:26.833 --> 11:28.933
Don't wear out the batteries
on mine.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.333
I am so excited for tonight.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.633
We've got Scott back.
The family is getting back
together.

11:44.700 --> 11:45.867
It's going to go off.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.733
Have you missed us?
I'm not going to lie, I have.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.867
I am buzzing Scott is back
in the lad's room.

11:54.933 --> 11:57.633
It's been wicked
getting to know Nathan.

11:57.700 --> 11:59.633
But I can't go on the pull with
him.

11:59.700 --> 12:03.167
Chloe's been a bit vague
about what happened with yous.

12:03.233 --> 12:06.500
I was pissed because
I'm trying to build a friendship

12:06.567 --> 12:08.167
and she tried to kiss us.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.767
Marty, we've had this chat
101 million times.

12:12.833 --> 12:16.500
It's you as well as Chloe.
You do lead her on.

12:16.567 --> 12:20.033
Shut up, haway, let's go get
pissed.
I am!

12:22.967 --> 12:25.833
Abbie, how are you now Scott's
back?
I'm excited.

12:25.900 --> 12:28.000
But I feel like he doesn't care.

12:28.067 --> 12:31.367
Tonight I'm going to try not
worry
about Scott pulling.

12:31.433 --> 12:34.700
I'm going to go out,
enjoy myself as a single girl.

12:34.767 --> 12:37.933
See how tonight goes.
See what he's like with you.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.333
Everything can change
once you drink!

12:41.500 --> 12:43.433
Come on, then!
Shut up!

12:43.500 --> 12:44.500
Boys!

12:44.567 --> 12:47.733
Haway!
We're waiting for yous. Come on.

12:47.800 --> 12:51.100
It's my first proper night out.
I've missed everyone.

12:51.167 --> 12:54.633
So I want to go out
and get absolutely fucking
walloped.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.533
I'm buzzing to be back and go
out.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.133
Haway, let's go. Scott's night
out!

12:59.200 --> 13:01.767
To the water!

13:01.833 --> 13:04.967
Scott and Chloe's back.
The family is increasing.

13:05.033 --> 13:07.933
So let's go out
and get absolutely fucking
mortal.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.233
What the fuck is Scott playing
at?

13:19.900 --> 13:23.000
She's got to realise
all he thinks about is himself.

13:23.067 --> 13:24.867
This is way too full on.

13:26.067 --> 13:28.033
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

13:31.000 --> 13:31.200
.

13:33.700 --> 13:33.900
.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.900
We get to Bijoux
and the place is bouncing.

13:47.967 --> 13:51.200
I can't wait to get absolutely
off my tits in here.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.767
To Scott's first night back!

14:01.433 --> 14:03.700
It's great
that we've got Scott back.

14:03.767 --> 14:06.767
All we need now is Aaron and
Gaz.

14:06.833 --> 14:09.867
But no-one has heard from Gary
yet.
I hope he's OK.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.967
It's my first night.
I'm determined to have a wicked
one.

14:20.133 --> 14:23.833
Marnie is looking all right
and her and Aaron aren't
together.

14:23.900 --> 14:26.700
And he's away.
I guess hungry minds can wander.

14:26.767 --> 14:29.167
And Scotty T is fucking
starving.

14:45.900 --> 14:48.467
Abbie's telling us
Scott has ignored her.

14:48.533 --> 14:50.900
Nothing worse
than feeling invisible.

14:50.967 --> 14:54.333
I feel so sorry for the girl,
but I have warned her.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.200
I promised that I wouldn't
let Scott get to us.

15:07.267 --> 15:11.567
But since he's back, he's not
spoken
to us and proper ignored us.

15:11.633 --> 15:13.833
And it's making me feel like
shit.

15:24.800 --> 15:28.267
Nathan is right, but I can't
help
the way that I feel right now.

15:28.333 --> 15:31.333
I'm going to forget about it
and have a good night.

15:39.300 --> 15:43.100
I'm drinking H20. It looks like
Marty isn't on the pull.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.200
I feel like this is the life for
me.

15:45.267 --> 15:50.467
Buh-uh-zuh-eh-nuh-guh, buzzing!
Buh-uh-zuh-eh-nuh-guh-guh,
buzzing!

15:55.500 --> 16:00.133
I look over and I can see that
Scott
has been sat with Marnie all
night.

16:00.200 --> 16:04.200
I know him and I know that
he's always had a thing for
Marnie.

16:12.700 --> 16:16.500
Now that Sophie has mentioned
it,
those two do look cosy.

16:16.567 --> 16:18.767
What the fuck is Scott playing
at?

16:18.833 --> 16:22.067
I know him and Aaron have fell
out
over Marnie in the past.

16:22.133 --> 16:23.633
Aaron won't be happy.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.500
If Scott is flirting with
Marnie,

16:36.567 --> 16:38.700
I wanna know
what she thinks about it.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.267
I'm rooting for Maaron.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.233
I don't want that prick
getting between them.

16:52.867 --> 16:56.867
Scott is trying to graft us
because I never slept with him.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.967
It's still a challenge.
You want what you can't have.

17:10.300 --> 17:14.133
Thank you, Anna.
Sober Chloe is absolutely
unreal.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.166
I don't feel like going on the
pull.

17:16.233 --> 17:18.700
I just want to have a wicked
night
with her.

17:28.067 --> 17:30.533
I promised I wouldn't let Scott
get to us.

17:30.600 --> 17:34.233
But now he's ignoring us
I'm finding it really hard.

17:40.267 --> 17:43.500
Abbie is crying because Scott
still hasn't spoke to her.

17:43.567 --> 17:47.167
She's got to realise
that all he thinks about is
himself.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.000
It's not her fault she's a
newbie.
She'll learn.

17:54.633 --> 17:57.167
I'm going to tell Scott
what he's done.

17:57.233 --> 18:00.800
Because I don't think he's
aware.
The boy is thick as fuck.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.267
Nathan's having a go at me
for not speaking to Abbie.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.033
I'm not giving her attention

18:09.100 --> 18:11.867
because as soon as I do,
she falls back in love.

18:11.933 --> 18:13.967
I can't be fucked with that,
like.

18:19.400 --> 18:22.800
Though I've done fuck all wrong,
I'm going to clear the air.

18:22.867 --> 18:26.767
Because this is out of hand
and I can't be fucked with
drama.

18:35.067 --> 18:38.700
Drop it, Scott? I'll drop it
when you man up and talk to us.

18:38.767 --> 18:41.167
You're making me feel worthless.

19:00.167 --> 19:02.733
Tonight has been wicked,
but I'm fucked.

19:02.800 --> 19:06.400
I need to get home before
I start making a pure tit of
myself.

19:16.333 --> 19:18.800
Get up. Don't be falling over.

19:18.867 --> 19:19.933
Martin, man!

19:21.667 --> 19:22.867
Go up into your bed.

19:22.933 --> 19:25.733
We get back to the house
and Abbie is in a bad way.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.533
And for once I'm sober enough
to be a good friend.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.533
Haway, pet, I'll take you to
bed.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.333
Chloe is actually
putting someone to bed.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.633
I am absolutely mortal.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.667
And after Scott upsetting us,
I just want to go to bed.

19:38.733 --> 19:42.300
Thank God Chloe is here for us.
She's such a good friend.

19:45.467 --> 19:48.867
I like you being sober.
Do you?

19:48.933 --> 19:52.867
Yeah, you're easy to handle
and easy to control.

19:52.933 --> 19:55.833
Everyone is saying
they prefer me sober.

19:55.900 --> 20:00.100
I hope they don't get used to
it.
Tomorrow I'm getting pure
mortal.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.300
I've had a wicked night.

20:04.367 --> 20:08.900
Before anything can ruin it,
I suggest we all go to bed.

20:08.967 --> 20:09.967
Goodnight!

20:17.000 --> 20:19.167
Marty asked us
to stay in the shag pad.

20:19.233 --> 20:22.767
He's realised me and him
can have a laugh and have a
cuddle

20:22.833 --> 20:25.067
without him pulling randomers.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.400
I know Chloe likes to cuddle.

20:37.467 --> 20:40.200
But once we cuddle,
we end up necking on.

20:40.267 --> 20:42.967
We know we just
can't help ourselves.

20:47.867 --> 20:51.400
Oh, my God. This is way too full
on.
And I'm sober.

20:51.467 --> 20:54.100
Marty said he sees me as a
friend.

20:54.167 --> 20:56.733
So I'm going to go to my own
bed.
Bye, friend!

21:07.233 --> 21:10.500
You're more like my girlfriend
when you're sober.

21:10.567 --> 21:12.967
He likes me more than a friend.

21:13.033 --> 21:17.200
Oi, oi. Anna's saying I've got
to go
for a ride with Nathan and
Marnie.

21:17.267 --> 21:19.600
This is hard, isn't it?
Ta-dah!

21:19.667 --> 21:22.967
No chance I'm eating that.
Don't want to be stuck on the
loo.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.467
(car revs)

21:24.533 --> 21:27.833
It sounds like a rocket!
Who the fuck is that?

21:27.900 --> 21:28.967
Who is it?

21:29.033 --> 21:30.967
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

21:34.467 --> 21:34.667
.

21:37.167 --> 21:37.367
.

21:49.833 --> 21:53.200
I'm not going to lie,
I'm actually amazing this
morning.

21:53.267 --> 21:56.800
I've woke up this morning
feeling fresh as fuck.

21:56.867 --> 21:59.467
They look like skunk's
arseholes.

21:59.533 --> 22:02.167
There's something good
about not drinking.

22:02.233 --> 22:04.167
Nah! Who am I kidding?

22:04.233 --> 22:07.300
It was devastating watching you.
Especially Abbie.

22:07.367 --> 22:10.500
I, me, put you to bed!
I can't believe that!

22:10.567 --> 22:13.467
I've woken up
and my head is in bits.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.000
And to make matters worse,

22:15.067 --> 22:18.433
I got upset last night
because Scott was ignoring us.

22:18.500 --> 22:23.433
To be honest, I feel
embarrassed.
You need to know it's not you.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.733
Abbie shouldn't be embarrassed.

22:25.800 --> 22:30.033
Especially in front of us.
We've been through it. Many
times.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.767
Oh, God,
I've got something to tell yous.

22:32.833 --> 22:37.000
Oh, what's this going to be?
What the fuck has she done now?

22:37.067 --> 22:39.133
So last night, Marty was a bit
drunk.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.833
And I went to bed
and he was being all nice.

22:41.900 --> 22:45.033
Then we started cuddling
and one thing led to another.

22:45.100 --> 22:48.233
And we did neck on.
Like, he started to get a
hard-on.

22:48.300 --> 22:51.533
So I think it was best
that I left the shag pad.

22:51.600 --> 22:55.200
Last night me and Marty did neck
on,
but we didn't have sex.

22:55.267 --> 22:57.433
I feel like such a ledge!

22:57.500 --> 23:00.367
What's going to happen if he
pulls?
Nothing.

23:00.433 --> 23:02.133
Nothing at all?
No.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.867
I'm just happy in myself
that I left the shag pad.

23:04.933 --> 23:09.400
I can't believe Marty tried
to crack on again with Chloe,

23:09.467 --> 23:12.000
when he's saying
that they're just friends.

23:12.067 --> 23:15.633
At least Chloe did the right
thing.
You go, girl.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.433
Maybe it's best I don't drink.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.700
Why don't you just have a few?
I wish I could just have a few.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.233
Ah, mate,
I was floating away last night.

23:27.300 --> 23:29.733
Oh, God,
it's all coming back to us now.

23:29.800 --> 23:33.767
I love sober Chloe, but how the
fuck
could she leave us last night

23:33.833 --> 23:35.467
with balls like watermelons?

23:35.533 --> 23:37.733
I come back with Chloe
and kissed her.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.067
What the fuck
is going through your head?

23:40.133 --> 23:43.400
I didn't shag her.
We all know you got pied off
Chloe.

23:43.467 --> 23:47.400
Things must be bad if you can't
pull a bird who's obsessed with
ya!

23:47.467 --> 23:49.600
I'm like that with Abbie, as
well.

23:49.667 --> 23:52.067
I can't be having her crying
on nights out.

23:52.133 --> 23:55.300
Being the newest member,
Abbie needs to enjoy herself

23:55.367 --> 23:56.933
instead of crying over me.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.767
I've already got about 4,000
birds
crying over us.

23:59.833 --> 24:02.533
And the last thing I want
is one in me fucking ken.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.800
Marty... (farts)
(laughs)

24:11.067 --> 24:13.067
I am so fresh this morning.

24:13.133 --> 24:16.867
I wonder if Marty remembers
everything what happened last
night.

24:16.933 --> 24:19.067
Good morning. You all right?

24:19.133 --> 24:22.467
Why you smiling like that?
Cos I'm not hungover.

24:22.533 --> 24:26.433
Thank God Chloe is in a good
mood.
Cos my head is fucking pounding.

24:26.500 --> 24:29.467
The last thing I need
is her going off at us.

24:29.533 --> 24:32.700
You do realise that last night
we were close to having sex.

24:32.767 --> 24:35.400
If I was drunk,
God knows what would've
happened.

24:35.467 --> 24:38.967
You're more like my girlfriend
when you're sober.

24:39.033 --> 24:41.133
Oh, my God! I'm so happy.

24:41.200 --> 24:45.033
Marty's said he sees sober Chloe
as his girlfriend.

24:45.100 --> 24:48.200
But that must mean
he likes me more than a friend.

24:48.267 --> 24:49.733
Give us a cuddle.

24:53.967 --> 24:57.867
Do you always have freckles?
No, it's just because I went
away.

24:57.933 --> 25:02.367
We can't help being cool.
Tweedledum and Tweedle-dick.

25:02.433 --> 25:04.467
You're jealous.
(phone rings)

25:04.533 --> 25:05.600
I'll get it!

25:05.667 --> 25:07.533
Who's ringing the phone?

25:07.600 --> 25:10.100
Oi, oi.
"Hiya, Scott."

25:10.167 --> 25:13.433
Someone is going to work today.
I just hope it's not me.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.167
"I want you to go
on a cycling tour of Newcastle."

25:16.233 --> 25:19.433
"To learn about the sights."
(laughs) All right.

25:19.500 --> 25:22.100
"I want you, Nathan and Marnie
to do it for me."

25:22.167 --> 25:24.067
All right, sound. Wicked, Anna.

25:24.133 --> 25:27.033
Show us the bikes,
because I'm splendid at riding.

25:27.100 --> 25:28.533
Cheers, Anna.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.533
I hope it's not me.
Work today...

25:32.567 --> 25:34.733
Nathan.
Fuck's sake! Again?!

25:34.800 --> 25:37.867
Marnie.
Ah, fuck's sake, man!

25:37.933 --> 25:41.233
And me! (laughs)
Yay!

25:41.300 --> 25:44.300
We're going to go
on a cycling tour of Newcastle.

25:44.367 --> 25:46.000
(they laugh)

25:46.067 --> 25:47.633
Is she taking the piss?

25:47.700 --> 25:50.533
Marnie, Nathan and Scott
are on a bike tour.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.667
It's good I don't go.
I need stabilisers.

25:53.733 --> 25:55.767
And that is really embarrassing.

25:55.833 --> 25:59.233
I don't like riding.
You like riding cock, don't you?

25:59.300 --> 26:02.567
That's not a bike, is it?!
Just imagine the seat's a dick.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.500
Scott, come on, let's go
spinning.

26:10.567 --> 26:12.900
Where's your work top?
Underneath.

26:12.967 --> 26:16.500
Ooh, sexy!
Eurgh. Flirting already.

26:16.567 --> 26:20.367
Today's going to be eventful.
Sophie is right.

26:20.433 --> 26:24.033
I've noticed
that Scott does flirt with
Marnie.

26:26.100 --> 26:29.033
I've been bit by one of the
ducks.
Look!

26:29.100 --> 26:31.167
They don't bite.
Do they not? No.

26:31.233 --> 26:35.533
I think, you know how every
night
we have a family meal together?

26:35.600 --> 26:38.033
Tonight, I think you girls
should do it.

26:38.100 --> 26:41.767
Are you having a laugh?!
Do you want food poisoning?

26:41.833 --> 26:45.000
The last time I cooked,
I gave me ex-boyfriend the
shits.

26:45.067 --> 26:49.400
Abbie's never cooked in her
life.
This is a recipe for disaster.

26:49.467 --> 26:52.767
Yous! He's going to get in
the water. Go on, get in!

26:52.833 --> 26:55.867
Just get in. He doesn't...
Let him talk to his friend.

26:55.933 --> 26:56.933
Bye, duck.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.767
Hello, pal.
Hiya! All right?

27:04.833 --> 27:05.900
Marvellous.

27:05.967 --> 27:07.300
I'm David.
Hi, David.

27:07.367 --> 27:08.933
Good to meet ya.
You too.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.133
Anna has got me, Nathan and
Scott
doing a bicycle tour.

27:13.200 --> 27:16.733
David's showing us the sights.
I hope he knows what he's in
for.

27:16.800 --> 27:19.433
These going to support my
weight?
I'm a big lad.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.333
I can see that.
Oh, all right, calm down!

27:22.400 --> 27:26.233
I'm so glad Nathan's on a solo
bike.
That means I share with Marnie.

27:26.300 --> 27:29.900
I can enjoy the best views of
the Toon. Her fucking bott!

27:31.200 --> 27:33.467
Lovely day for a bike ride!
Aye.

27:36.367 --> 27:38.400
This is a lot more fun
than I thought.

27:38.467 --> 27:40.600
I've got Scott
doing all the peddling.

27:40.667 --> 27:43.633
That's the price he's got to pay
to look at my arse.

27:43.700 --> 27:46.367
Which one's the site?
That's the site.

27:46.433 --> 27:48.333
The Baltic.
What's the Baltic?

27:48.400 --> 27:51.733
An art gallery. Have you not
been?
No, but I want to.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.533
Since when
did you become interested in
art?

27:54.600 --> 27:57.600
The closest you've come to art
is finger painting.

27:57.667 --> 27:58.867
Go on, Marnie!

28:00.133 --> 28:02.933
Oh, you fucker, this is a hard
one,
isn't it? Argh!

28:03.800 --> 28:05.633
Know where you are?
The monument.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.600
Know what it looks like? A dick.

28:07.667 --> 28:10.033
Is it as big as yours?
What do you think?

28:10.100 --> 28:11.933
Of course Scott's is bigger!

28:12.000 --> 28:14.867
Me and Scott are flirty,
but nothing would happen.

28:14.933 --> 28:17.267
Obviously,
because of Abbie and Aaron.

28:17.333 --> 28:19.367
I would never want to hurt them.

28:19.433 --> 28:22.100
I've enjoyed your company.
It's a pleasure.

28:22.167 --> 28:26.600
Today, I've seen the Baltic,
the Tyne Bridge, the monument.

28:26.667 --> 28:31.400
But after all that, I just want
to go home and rest my sore
arse!

28:31.467 --> 28:32.833
Thanks, David!

28:41.300 --> 28:43.767
This is how you cut sexily. Bum
out.

28:45.267 --> 28:50.700
Bend your back like this.
Ooh, ah. Wacha!

28:52.767 --> 28:54.100
Thanks, Mr Taxi Driver!

28:55.300 --> 28:57.700
Hello, chicken nugget!
Hi.

28:57.767 --> 28:59.100
You cooking chicken?

28:59.167 --> 29:02.500
We get back, and Chloe and Abbie
are cooking everyone food.

29:02.567 --> 29:06.433
There's no chance I'm eating
that.
I don't wanna be stuck on the
loo!

29:06.500 --> 29:09.433
How was work?
It was actually really funny.

29:09.500 --> 29:12.100
I learnt that Newcastle
is very historical.

29:12.167 --> 29:15.067
Who the hell knew that Newcastle
had history?

29:15.133 --> 29:19.067
The only thing I know is where
the bars and chicken shops are.

29:19.133 --> 29:21.633
How many onions?!
(they laugh)

29:21.700 --> 29:26.100
Right, go get ready for tonight,
then! I can't wait to surprise
you!

29:35.433 --> 29:38.100
Everyone!
It's feeding time at the zoo!

29:38.167 --> 29:40.633
(howls)

29:40.700 --> 29:42.533
Chloe isn't hygienic.

29:42.600 --> 29:45.633
And Abbie is going to get fake
tan
all over the food.

29:45.700 --> 29:48.100
I'm actually scared for my own
life.

29:48.167 --> 29:50.033
Ta-da!

29:52.767 --> 29:56.267
Are them hash browns?
That's actually lush!

29:56.333 --> 29:58.867
Yorkshire puddings and a pizza!
A pizza?

29:58.933 --> 30:01.233
This is my food idea of heaven!

30:01.300 --> 30:04.667
With her not drinking
and cooking skills,

30:04.733 --> 30:06.367
Chloe would make a good wife!

30:06.433 --> 30:10.967
Was that a snail on top?
It was mushroom. Are you joking?

30:11.033 --> 30:13.033
That was my idea to put that on
top.

30:13.100 --> 30:15.833
Despite Abbie and Chloe
trying to kill us,

30:15.900 --> 30:18.367
it's great being back
with the family.

30:18.433 --> 30:21.333
But it's not the same
without Gaz or Aaron.

30:23.100 --> 30:24.867
Yous!

30:24.933 --> 30:26.500
Fucking hell, is that a van?

30:26.567 --> 30:28.533
What the actual fuck?

30:28.600 --> 30:30.933
(car revs)
It's like a rocket, isn't it?

30:33.767 --> 30:36.967
I'm nervous.
Who is it?

30:38.467 --> 30:40.733
(all cheer)

30:40.800 --> 30:42.567
I'm just so excited to be back.

30:42.633 --> 30:46.133
And I'm even more buzzing
that everybody is excited to see
us.

30:47.633 --> 30:51.700
It's Gaz! I'm fucking buzzing
to have my brother back.

30:53.567 --> 30:56.467
Gary's walked in
and by God, am I happy to see
him!

30:56.533 --> 30:58.467
I'm so pleased he's back.

30:58.533 --> 31:01.467
Where have you been?
Have you been on holiday?

31:01.533 --> 31:03.667
I knew Gary wouldn't
miss being here.

31:03.733 --> 31:06.567
It's good to have him back.
I've missed him.

31:06.633 --> 31:09.800
Sorry I'm late.
I've had a bit of shit to sort
out.

31:09.867 --> 31:13.233
I've actually got a bit of news
about meself.

31:14.633 --> 31:16.633
I've got some news for the
family.

31:16.700 --> 31:19.800
And I'm not sure
how they're going to take it.

31:19.867 --> 31:24.600
It's been quite a hard...
decision.

31:24.667 --> 31:28.400
Gary looks very worried.
And he's making me very nervous.

31:28.467 --> 31:29.967
I've got a lump in my throat.

31:30.833 --> 31:33.000
(sighs) Erm...

31:33.067 --> 31:35.900
Spit it out, Gary.
This isn't the fucking X Factor!

31:37.067 --> 31:39.167
Gary, are you taking the piss?
No.

31:39.233 --> 31:41.167
This is massive.
Cheers!

31:41.233 --> 31:43.267
Tonight's going to go off.
I feel it!

31:45.133 --> 31:48.667
Who the fuck do you think you
are?
Fucking hell, Marty!

31:50.233 --> 31:52.133
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:54.933 --> 31:55.133
.

31:57.667 --> 31:57.867
.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.533
I've actually got a bit of news.

32:08.600 --> 32:12.133
Gaz has got back and already
he's dropping a bombshell on us.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.367
Come on, Gaz, what is it?

32:14.433 --> 32:18.200
It's been quite a hard decision.

32:18.267 --> 32:20.133
Don't say that you're leaving.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.600
Erm...

32:21.667 --> 32:27.267
Nah, mate...
But now... I am single!

32:27.333 --> 32:30.400
Fuck off!
What?!

32:30.467 --> 32:32.067
I am back and I am single.

32:32.133 --> 32:34.467
Things didn't really work out
between us.

32:34.533 --> 32:38.400
But I am buzzing that I am back
with my Geordie family.

32:38.467 --> 32:40.333
Are you taking the piss?
Nah.

32:40.400 --> 32:45.100
I haven't been in a house with
Gary
when he's single for a long
time.

32:45.167 --> 32:47.033
I'm actually really scared.

32:52.433 --> 32:55.967
Gaz is single, he's back.
Oh, I'm so glad!

32:56.033 --> 33:00.333
Does that mean you're on the
pull?
(they laugh)

33:00.400 --> 33:03.433
I'm not going straight back
on the pull. I'm not a dick.

33:03.500 --> 33:07.000
But when all four boys
are back in the swing of it,

33:07.067 --> 33:09.400
things are going to get
interesting.

33:09.467 --> 33:12.200
I'm buzzing to be back
and I feel at home.

33:12.267 --> 33:14.633
I cannot wait to get smashed.
So cheers!

33:14.700 --> 33:17.833
(all) Cheers!

33:17.900 --> 33:20.633
Come on then, let's get out!
I want to see the room!

33:20.700 --> 33:22.533
It's mint to have Gaz back.

33:22.600 --> 33:25.133
So we'll go out tonight
and get off our dish.

33:26.633 --> 33:28.500
Welcome to your new room!

33:28.567 --> 33:31.933
It's been fucking ages since the
boys
have been in this room.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
It feels weird.

33:34.067 --> 33:35.300
Right.

33:36.433 --> 33:38.700
Hope you miss us.
Martin, I know you will.

33:38.767 --> 33:42.367
Now that Gaz is back, I can
finally
move back into the girls' room.

33:42.433 --> 33:46.200
Cos I'm sick of fucking
babysitting
these two babies. Bye, boys.

33:46.267 --> 33:47.333
See you never!

33:47.400 --> 33:49.400
Hello, you!

33:49.467 --> 33:51.733
Marty was never
going to get with Chloe.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.900
Then last night
he necked on with her.

33:53.967 --> 33:55.533
She said no.
She said no?!

33:55.600 --> 33:59.033
So that means Marty is chasing
Chloe
and Chloe has pied Marty?

33:59.100 --> 34:01.100
How have things changed that
much?

34:01.167 --> 34:04.767
I'm not going straight back
on the pull. Ease myself back
in.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.233
I might, aye.
I pied her, mate!

34:08.300 --> 34:10.800
Feel free
to crack on with Abbie, mate.

34:10.867 --> 34:14.367
You'd be doing me a massive
favour
and saving me a load of grief.

34:14.433 --> 34:15.699
(laughs)

34:15.766 --> 34:18.100
First night out.
Let's have a good one.

34:18.167 --> 34:20.199
Go get showered and sort that
hair.

34:22.266 --> 34:24.199
Can't wait to look at your
willy.

34:24.266 --> 34:26.733
It's been five seconds.
No, I like to look.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.667
Didn't take Nathan long
to move back in.

34:29.733 --> 34:33.333
He doesn't fit in with the lads.
He's like a sore thumb.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.632
Get it out.
We haven't seen cocks in ages.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.367
I'm going to whip it out now(!)

34:37.433 --> 34:41.167
Not a chance, Chloe.
It's bloody freezing in this
room.

34:41.233 --> 34:45.433
Abbie, how do you feel about
Gary?
He's single. Would you ever go
there?

34:45.500 --> 34:48.667
I mean, he's got a tan, hasn't
he?
You love a tan.

34:48.733 --> 34:53.800
Love a tan. I'm happy to spend
time
with yous. Still thingy over
Scott.

34:53.867 --> 34:56.500
Sophie is asking us
if I'd go there with Gary.

34:56.567 --> 34:58.767
He's been in the door five
minutes.

34:58.833 --> 35:01.333
Right, OK, yous!
Gonna be a good one!

35:01.400 --> 35:03.333
Go, go, go!

35:08.700 --> 35:10.233
Scott!
What?

35:10.300 --> 35:13.400
You've all got the same
hairstyle!
(laughs)

35:13.467 --> 35:17.433
Tonight is about catching up,
finding gossip and getting
smashed.

35:17.500 --> 35:20.233
Cheers to Gary being back
and Gary being single!

35:20.300 --> 35:22.467
Cheers, everyone!
(all cheer)

35:22.533 --> 35:23.700
Buzzing!

35:25.667 --> 35:29.200
Tonight is going to go off.
We've got Gary and Scott back.

35:29.267 --> 35:31.900
We're all going to go
and have a family night,

35:31.967 --> 35:33.633
ready for Aaron's fight.

35:38.867 --> 35:43.233
We arrive at the club, and I
know
tonight is going to be fucking
mint.

35:47.467 --> 35:49.800
We get to the club
and it is going off.

35:49.867 --> 35:52.267
I want get pissed as quick as I
can.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.933
Before she's wrecked,
I'm going to have a word.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.667
I cannot be arsed with tears
when everyone's in a wicked
mood.

36:20.667 --> 36:24.533
I'm having a good time
and then Scotty comes to talk to
me.

36:24.600 --> 36:28.467
I am feeling a bit nervous.
But at least he's talking to us.

36:32.267 --> 36:35.133
I see Scott and Abbie talking.
I know what he's doing.

36:35.200 --> 36:39.367
Smooth her over, so he can pull
and
Abbie won't give him a hard
time.

36:48.600 --> 36:52.967
The weight has been lifted
by having a chat with Scott.

36:53.033 --> 36:56.400
Now, I'm just going to
concentrate
on me and have fun.

37:04.300 --> 37:07.067
Looking round, it's all changed
since last time.

37:07.133 --> 37:09.933
We're one big, happy family.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I want to know
how Abbie's fitting in.

37:17.233 --> 37:20.633
Gary hasn't even asked how I am
or what I've been up to!

37:20.700 --> 37:25.733
First thing he asks is how Abbie
is.
What the fuck, Gary?

37:31.533 --> 37:35.467
It must be hard. Scott was
always
going to toy with her.

37:35.533 --> 37:40.333
She needs to enjoy herself
because
she's part of this family now.

37:55.033 --> 37:58.300
I look over and I don't know
if it's just my eyes,

37:58.367 --> 38:01.967
or has Scott been spending
a lot of time with Marnie?

38:02.033 --> 38:03.633
Is he cracking on with her?

38:03.700 --> 38:06.700
I'm going to see what the crack
is.
I am not happy.

38:11.567 --> 38:16.067
I'm having a chat with Scotty
and it's a bit flirty, a bit
close.

38:16.133 --> 38:18.500
That's what Scott's
like with everyone.

38:18.567 --> 38:22.433
Marty, just stay the fuck out of
it.
It's nothing to do with you.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.433
Marty, I'm single
and Marnie's single. That's game
on!

38:41.133 --> 38:44.567
Scott does not give a fuck
about lad code. I don't trust
him.

38:44.633 --> 38:47.700
Because Aaron's not here,
I've got to keep an eye on him.

38:47.767 --> 38:49.200
I've got to speak to Gaz.

38:58.267 --> 39:01.400
Marty, chill out!
Stay the fuck out of it.

39:01.467 --> 39:04.067
Aaron will be back soon
and he will deal with it.

39:17.433 --> 39:20.333
I'm speaking to Chloe
because she calms us down.

39:27.600 --> 39:31.333
Marty is convinced that Scott
is trying to crack on with
Marnie.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.833
We need Aaron back.
Marty, just please stay out of
it!

39:43.400 --> 39:47.967
I'm sick of Marty talking shit.
The kid needs to quiet down.

39:54.133 --> 39:56.467
I'm not the one embarrassing
myself.

39:56.533 --> 39:58.900
You're cracking on
with your mate's ex.

40:05.567 --> 40:08.100
Calm down, you little fucking
prick.

40:23.667 --> 40:25.133
Haway, man!

40:28.733 --> 40:32.967
Marty, I told you to calm down.
This has got nowt to do with
you!

40:35.033 --> 40:38.767
Why has Marty gone and caused a
scene? Stop embarrassing
yourself!

40:43.467 --> 40:45.400
Shock. I've been back two
minutes

40:45.467 --> 40:49.267
and I'm playing daddy
to these fucking idiots.

40:49.333 --> 40:52.567
Now let's just get out of here
before it gets any worse.

40:54.833 --> 40:58.500
Fuck this, I'm staying well out
of Scott's way for the night.

41:03.133 --> 41:04.833
Get in there!

41:04.900 --> 41:06.867
We're back!

41:06.933 --> 41:09.000
Hello, everybody!
Hi, everyone!

41:10.600 --> 41:13.233
We get back to the house
and I am mortal.

41:13.300 --> 41:16.867
I am in no mood to party.
I'm off to bed.

41:20.133 --> 41:22.233
Did you like your first night
back?

41:22.300 --> 41:25.233
I did. It was everything I
expected.
And more!

41:25.300 --> 41:27.567
Everyone got pissed.
There was a fight!

41:27.633 --> 41:32.100
It was literally the most
perfect
first night out, like, ever.

41:32.167 --> 41:35.267
I'm so glad that Gary had
a wicked first night back.

41:35.333 --> 41:37.667
Even though Marty was being a
dick.

41:37.733 --> 41:38.933
I'm off to bed.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.200
Tomorrow it's Aaron's fight
and I can't fucking wait to see
him.

41:45.167 --> 41:47.967
I've had better nights.
I don't enjoy falling out.

41:48.033 --> 41:51.100
I'm just going to take
my fucking face straight to bed.

41:54.933 --> 41:56.533
Best friends.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.367
Tonight has gone sour.

41:58.433 --> 42:02.033
And I know one person I can rely
on
to cheer us up. That's Chloe.

42:04.633 --> 42:06.400
I don't think it's a good idea.

42:06.467 --> 42:09.133
Marty is asking me
to sleep in the shag pad.

42:09.200 --> 42:13.067
I don't think it's a good idea,
because me and him are mortal.

42:13.133 --> 42:16.167
Me and you sleep in the shag
pad.
Separate blankets.

42:17.367 --> 42:20.800
I don't think that's a good
idea.
Last time you got very frisky.

42:20.867 --> 42:22.833
I've had a really shit night.

42:22.900 --> 42:26.133
All I need now
is a cuddle from me best mate.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.733
Can she not see
how much I need her right now?

42:28.800 --> 42:29.967
I love ya.

42:30.033 --> 42:32.500
Fucking hell.
Marty is saying he loves us.

42:32.567 --> 42:34.967
He will literally do anything
for a shag.

42:35.033 --> 42:38.933
The only thing I'm sharing
my bed with is a bowl of pasta!

42:41.333 --> 42:45.700
I can't believe Chloe's went to
bed.
All I wanted was me best mate.

42:45.767 --> 42:49.300
The only person in this house
who actually understands us.

43:00.867 --> 43:02.000
(all) Aaron! Aaron!

43:02.067 --> 43:05.433
We're on the way to Birmingham
ready for fight night!

43:05.500 --> 43:08.767
Is that an apology, Marty?
Consider the bridge built.

43:08.833 --> 43:12.633
All I wanna do is get in there
and get the job done!

43:12.700 --> 43:14.933
He looks like Kung Fu Panda!
Cha! Cha!

43:19.567 --> 43:21.500
What's she got that I don't?

43:21.567 --> 43:24.633
Marty didn't come home
and Scott is nowhere to be seen.

43:26.600 --> 43:29.000
The family
have gone to so much effort.

43:30.233 --> 43:33.867
I don't know whether to watch...
to scream... to hide...

43:33.933 --> 43:35.133
Shower, anyone?

43:35.200 --> 43:36.933
It's gonna be a good one!

43:38.533 --> 43:40.067
Is Gary flirting with us?

43:41.333 --> 43:44.033
If this is a sign of things to
come,
bring it on.

44:13.867 --> 44:14.067
.
