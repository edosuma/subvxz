08:30.780 --> 08:32.532
- HE'S READ YOUR PLAY.
HE LIKES IT.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.081
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT.

08:34.130 --> 08:35.813
HE READ IT?
- HE TRAINED UNDER ME.

08:35.860 --> 08:37.339
I GAVE HIM HIS FIRST JOB.

08:37.370 --> 08:39.611
HE OWES HIS WHOLE CAREER
TO ME.

08:39.650 --> 08:41.686
- GOOD.
THAT'S AMAZING.

08:41.720 --> 08:46.612
- AND THERE IS ONLY
ONE SLOT LEFI'

08:46.660 --> 08:49.276
IN THE NEW VOICES SERIES,
AND WE WANT THAT SLOT, DON'T WE?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.072
- YES, WE WANT THAT SLOT.
- YES, WE DO.

08:51.110 --> 08:56.047
NOW, THEATER IS HALF ART
AND HALF RELATIONSHIPS.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.354
- OH, GOD.
THAT'S WHERE THE--

08:57.390 --> 09:00.154
- SO TOMORROW NIGHT IS WHEN YOU
START USING YOUR RELATIONSHIPS.

09:00.190 --> 09:02.249
- OKAY, YEAH,
I'LL PUT THEM TO WORK.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.814
- THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

09:04.850 --> 09:06.602
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I THINK WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.028
I LIKE THE CHANGES
YOU GUYS HAVE MADE.

09:08.060 --> 09:09.880
I LIKE 'EM A LOT.
I LIKE THOSE BACKGROUND IMAGES.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.922
AND, UH,
I THINK IT REALLY POPS.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.029
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH, YOU BET.

09:13.060 --> 09:15.062
- YEAH, I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT--
REALLY SIMPLIFIED.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.783
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

09:16.830 --> 09:19.105
- I THINK THE ONLY THING I'D SAY
IS MAYBE THE LETTERING, COPY--

09:19.140 --> 09:20.653
MAKE IT A LITTLE
BOLDER SOMEHOW,

09:20.690 --> 09:23.762
SO IT KIND OF LEAPS
OFF THE PAGE, YOU KNOW?

09:23.800 --> 09:24.767
UH...

09:24.800 --> 09:26.381
- HEY.
- HEY.

09:26.420 --> 09:27.387

09:27.420 --> 09:28.660
- YOU SURE?
- YEP.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.076
- IT'LL BE READY
TO SEE IN 24 HOURS.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.599
- IT'S OKAY.

09:31.640 --> 09:32.800
- THEY'RE JUST GONNA
MAKE A COUPLE MORE TWEAKS.

09:32.840 --> 09:33.875
BASICALLY WITH THE COPY.

09:33.910 --> 09:35.639
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IF
THEY DID SOME SORT OF 3-D...

09:35.670 --> 09:37.353
- ABSOLUTELY, YEAH. JUST TO
MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE HIP.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.776
- BOOM.
- YEAH.

09:38.810 --> 09:40.778
- IT'S JUST...

09:40.820 --> 09:44.119
IT LOOKS LIKE A PICTURE.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.720
- WELL, IT'S A PHOTOGRAPH.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.957
- YES. YES.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.821
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE AN AD.

09:51.860 --> 09:53.680
- WELL, IT IS, CORY.
IT'S AN AD.

09:53.730 --> 09:55.721
- YES.
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.625
WAIT. WAIT.

09:57.660 --> 09:59.969
WAIT.

10:00.010 --> 10:01.728
OKAY, IT'S AN AD.

10:01.770 --> 10:02.759
- YEAH.

10:02.800 --> 10:06.804
- WHAT IF IT WAS AN AD
THAT LOOKED LIKE ART?

10:06.840 --> 10:08.421
- HMM.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.325
- OKAY, I'VE GOT--
I'VE GOT THIS FRIEND.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.941
HE DOES THESE DRAWINGS.
REMEMBER SPYDER, RIGHT?

10:11.990 --> 10:12.775
- I DO REMEMBER SPYDER.

10:12.810 --> 10:14.812
- SPYDER--
WE GET SPYDER IN HERE

10:14.850 --> 10:17.671
TO DO THESE AMAZING DRAWINGS
OF THE SHOE,

10:17.720 --> 10:19.119
JUST THE SHOE.

10:19.170 --> 10:20.740
- NOTHING ELSE?
- NOTHING ELSE.

10:20.790 --> 10:22.712
- NO COPY?
- NO COPY.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.786
- YOU KNOW...
- ALL COPY, JUST WORDS.

10:25.830 --> 10:28.822
- SO, NO SHOE?
- NO, SHOE WITH WORDS.

10:28.860 --> 10:31.033
THE SHOE...IS WORDS.

10:31.070 --> 10:32.799
- OH, I SEE.
SO THE IMAGE OF THE SHOE

10:32.830 --> 10:34.309
IS MADE OF THE COPY,
THE WORDS.

10:34.350 --> 10:35.760
- YES.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.176
- OKAY. I THINK THAT'S
AN INTERESTING IDEA.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.801
- I'M TEXTING SPYDER
RIGHT NOW.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.046
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.968
TH ESE GUYS ARE TOTALLY CAPABLE
OF RUNNING WITH THAT IDEA.

10:42.020 --> 10:44.159
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:44.190 --> 10:47.057
- I THINK IT COULD BE AMAZING.
- RIGHT?

10:47.090 --> 10:48.910
I MEAN, THAT'S STREET.

10:48.950 --> 10:50.884
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- UH, I'M KAREN.

10:50.920 --> 10:51.989
- KAREN.

10:52.030 --> 10:55.431
- KIM. KAREN. CORY. COOL.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.096
BRAVERMAN.

10:58.140 --> 11:00.096
- THAT'S MY NAME.

11:00.140 --> 11:02.233
YEAH.

11:02.280 --> 11:05.169
OKAY, WELL, UH...

11:05.210 --> 11:07.178
- WE HAVE THE STATEMENT
FROM THE MUNSON CORPORATION,

11:07.210 --> 11:09.770
BUT WE'RE STILL WAITING ON
THE DISCOVERY FROM ERIC GAINER,

11:09.800 --> 11:11.734
SO I EXPECT THAT
BY THIS AFTERNOON.

11:11.770 --> 11:14.694
DO YOU MIND
IF I CATCH UP WITH YOU?

11:29.240 --> 11:30.434
- HEY.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.165
- OH, MY GOD, YOU REEK!

11:33.200 --> 11:35.509
- YOU'RE SO CUTE.
OOH.

11:35.550 --> 11:37.927
- AMBER,
I KNOW YOU'RE VERY UPSET

11:37.970 --> 11:39.244
ABOUT NOT GETTING
INTO COLLEGE,

11:39.280 --> 11:40.861
BUT THIS IS NOT HOW
YOU DEAL WITH THINGS.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.141
- AROMATHERAPY.
- YOU ARE HUMILIATING.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.489
- I-I CAN EXPLAIN, AND
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

11:45.530 --> 11:47.521
AND YOU'RE SO NICE,
AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING,

11:47.560 --> 11:49.733
BUT, LIKE,
I'M NOT GONNA BE A LAWYER.

11:49.770 --> 11:51.419
- CLEARLY.
- AND NOW I DON'T NEED MONEY,

11:51.460 --> 11:52.904
BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA GO
TO COLLEGE.

11:52.950 --> 11:54.281
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

11:54.330 --> 11:55.945
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN HERE
IF I DON'T HAVE TO,

11:55.990 --> 11:59.084
AND I DON'T HAVE TO,
SO I QUIT.

11:59.130 --> 12:01.337
I'M SORRY, BUT I QUIT.
- AMBER. AMBER.

12:01.370 --> 12:03.122
- I JUST CAN'T TAKE MYSELF
SO SERIOUSLY, YOU KNOW?

12:03.170 --> 12:04.740
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
LOOK AT THIS.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.269
WHAT, I WANT THIS?
I DON'T WANT THIS.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.198
AND, LOOK, THERE'S NOT EVEN
SUNLIGHT IN HERE.

12:08.240 --> 12:11.129
I MEAN, THIS IS, LIKE,
A NIGHTMARE, RIGHT, GUYS?

12:11.170 --> 12:13.206
I DON'T WANT THIS.
DO YOU GUYS WANT THIS?

12:13.240 --> 12:14.889
THIS IS--
THIS ISN'T EVEN, UH, REAL.

12:14.940 --> 12:16.100
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

12:16.140 --> 12:17.767
I'M SORRY.
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.904
- AMBER.
- I'LL SEE YOU SOON, OKAY?

12:25.600 --> 12:29.149
[indie rock music playing,

12:29.190 --> 12:31.397
- HEY, HONEY.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.499
- HEY.

12:33.540 --> 12:34.848
- KIND OF.
LISTENING TO MUSIC.

12:34.890 --> 12:36.118
- THAT'S COOL.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.229
- YEAH.

12:37.270 --> 12:40.023
- I JUST--I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.334
- OKAY.

12:41.380 --> 12:42.540
- OKAY.

12:42.580 --> 12:46.107
UM, IT'S--ACTUALLY...

12:46.140 --> 12:48.938
THIS MIGHT MAKE YOU
A LITTLE BIT UNCOMFORTABLE,

12:48.970 --> 12:51.859
UM, BUT I JUST NEED
TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.596
- OKAY.

12:54.630 --> 12:57.190
- ARE YOU AND ALEX
HAVING SEX?

13:01.950 --> 13:03.497
- NO.

13:03.540 --> 13:05.599
- HADDIE.
- NO. NO.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.948
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

13:06.990 --> 13:10.289
- BECAUSE--NO SORT
OF INTERCOURSE OR SEX.

13:10.340 --> 13:11.432
- I SAID "NO" THREE TIMES.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.050
- OKAY,
'CAUSE IF YOU WERE,

13:13.100 --> 13:15.887
I'D WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
YOU COULD TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.

13:15.930 --> 13:17.852
- OKAY, I HEAR YOU.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.470
- 'CAUSE I'M HERE FOR YOU.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.067
SO THE ANSWER
IS, NO, YOU'RE NOT?

13:21.110 --> 13:22.065
- RIGHT.

13:22.110 --> 13:24.829
I MEAN, WHAT--
YOU WERE MY AGE OR SOMETHING

13:24.870 --> 13:26.349
WHEN YOU FIRST HAD SEX?

13:26.390 --> 13:30.281
IS THAT WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:30.320 --> 13:32.493
- I WAS NOT.
I WAS 22.

13:32.530 --> 13:34.839
I WAS 22, AT COLLEGE.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.848
- WOW.

13:36.880 --> 13:37.949
- IT'S A BIG STEP.

13:37.980 --> 13:40.847
I JUST DECIDED
THAT I WANTED TO WAIT.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.087
- OKAY.
- SO...

13:43.130 --> 13:44.574
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

13:44.610 --> 13:49.058
CONTINUE.
I'LL JUST, UM...

13:49.100 --> 13:52.581
HOWEVER, HADDIE, IF YOU
ARE WANTING TO TALK ABOUT IT,

13:52.620 --> 13:54.963
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU, OKAY?

13:55.000 --> 13:58.891
- OKAY.

13:58.940 --> 14:01.204
- OKAY.

14:08.220 --> 14:09.630
- I JUST CAN'T DO THIS
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

14:09.670 --> 14:11.114
- ...OR NONE OF IT'S SUNK IN.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.491
YOU'RE GONNA GO UP
AND JUST HIDE IN YOUR ROOM.

14:12.540 --> 14:14.223
- I'M JUST EXHAUSTED...
[overlapping arguing]

14:14.260 --> 14:16.228
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU NOT MAKE
ME CHASE YOU UP THE STAIRS...

14:16.260 --> 14:18.080
- I JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT
OF ALONE TIME.

14:18.130 --> 14:19.154
- YOU NEED ALONE TIME?

14:19.200 --> 14:21.020
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA FOLLOW ME
IN HERE, ARE YOU?

14:21.060 --> 14:22.197
- YEAH, I'M GONNA
FOLLOW YOU IN HERE.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.571
- IT'S KIND OF A PRIVATE MATTER,
BUT I GUESS I'LL WAIT.

14:23.620 --> 14:24.928
- THAT'S THE KIND
OF SUPER MOM I AM.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.302
I'M JUST WONDERING
WHO YOU WANT TO BE.

14:26.340 --> 14:27.204
DO YOU WANT TO BE THE PERSON

14:27.240 --> 14:28.992
WHO GETS HIGH
AND YELLS AT YOUR AUNT?

14:29.040 --> 14:30.166
- I DON'T KNOW
WHO I WANT TO BE YET.

14:30.210 --> 14:30.995
I NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT, OKAY?

14:31.040 --> 14:32.302
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

14:32.350 --> 14:35.171
AND I FEEL REALLY BAD ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED AT THE OFFICE, OKAY?

14:35.210 --> 14:36.142
- GOOD.

14:36.180 --> 14:38.068
- AND I WAS NOT TRYING
TO BE MEAN TO HER.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.589
I JUST WAS TRYING TO,
YOU KNOW,

14:39.630 --> 14:41.279
SAY WHAT I FELT
IN THE MOMENT.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.662
- YOU CAN'T SAY
WHAT YOU FEEL IN THE MOMENT.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.110
THAT'S WHAT A CHILD DOES.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.014
AND YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME

14:45.050 --> 14:46.665
YOU WANT TO BE TREATED
LIKE AN ADULT,

14:46.710 --> 14:48.109
SO YOU HAVE TO ACT LIKE ONE.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.366
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.220
I KNOW IT WAS A SETBACK
NOT TO GET INTO SCHOOL,

14:51.260 --> 14:53.080
BUT WE JUST HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

14:53.130 --> 14:55.917
WHAT'S THE NEXT YEAR GONNA BE.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.301
I THINK WE SHOULD--

15:00.340 --> 15:03.275
AND DON'T SAY "NO" TO ME.

15:03.310 --> 15:06.279
WE NEED TO HAVE PASTA.

15:08.110 --> 15:08.929
- PASTA.

15:08.970 --> 15:10.380
- WE NEED TO GO
TO THE "FARFALLALA,"

15:10.420 --> 15:11.933
WHATEVER IT'S CALLED.

15:11.980 --> 15:13.459
- AT THIS POINT,
IT'S WORTH A TRY.

15:13.490 --> 15:15.242
- I MEAN, WHAT OPTIONS
DO WE HAVE, REALLY?

15:15.290 --> 15:16.496
- NOT MANY.

15:16.530 --> 15:21.046
WE'LL EAT THE PASTA.
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

15:21.090 --> 15:23.490
[saw whirring]

15:26.780 --> 15:29.157

15:35.450 --> 15:38.544
- LOOK WHAT THE HOME-IMPROVEMENT
STORK DELIVERED US.

15:38.590 --> 15:40.308
- UH-OH.
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

15:40.350 --> 15:42.318
- HOW ABOUT SOME KITCHEN TILES?

15:42.350 --> 15:44.147
LOOK AT THESE BAD LARRYS.

15:44.180 --> 15:45.408
- OH, WOW.

15:45.460 --> 15:48.668
UM, THEY'RE THE WRONG COLOR.

15:48.700 --> 15:52.249
- LIGHT BLUE.
- THESE ARE AQUA BLUE.

15:52.290 --> 15:54.087
- THEY'RE LIGHT BLUE, MAN.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.530
- WELL, THEY'RE LIGHT AQUA--

15:55.570 --> 15:59.290
THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD SEE
IN THE LITTLE MERMAID'S KITCHEN.

15:59.330 --> 16:00.570
- OKAY, WELL...

16:00.610 --> 16:03.261
- WE GOT TO ORDER NEW ONES.
- WE'RE NOT ORDERING NEW ONES.

16:03.300 --> 16:05.359
THAT'S GONNA TAKE ONE WEEK,
MAYBE TWO WEEKS.

16:05.410 --> 16:07.787
- ALL RIGHT,
SO IT TAKES A WEEK.

16:07.820 --> 16:09.993
- WE'RE USING THESE TILES.

16:10.030 --> 16:12.169
- LISTEN, JOEL,
IT'S GOT TO BE PERFECT, MAN.

16:12.210 --> 16:14.235
YOU CAN'T PUT THOSE IN THERE.

16:14.280 --> 16:15.554
- IT'S A HOUSE, CROSBY.

16:15.590 --> 16:18.309
IT'S GONNA DO
WHATEVER IT'S GONNA DO.

16:18.350 --> 16:21.763
AND--AND KITCHEN TILES AREN'T
GONNA BE THE DEAL BREAKER HERE.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.449
YOU...

16:23.490 --> 16:27.119
YOU HAVE GOT
TO SHOW HER THIS PLACE.

16:27.150 --> 16:28.526
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:28.570 --> 16:33.257
I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE HARD,
BUT YOU JUST...

16:33.300 --> 16:35.700
YOU GOT TO FIND OUT.

I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.497
UH...
- SAY WHAT?

17:05.540 --> 17:08.816
- ALEX AND I HAVE HAD SEX.

UH...

17:20.720 --> 17:23.200
- OKAY.

17:23.240 --> 17:27.199
I JUST DON'T, UH, HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT TO SAY RIGHT NOW.

17:27.250 --> 17:29.241
- I GUESS I SHOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD YOU.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.554
- NO, NO, NO, NO,

17:30.600 --> 17:33.239
I MEAN, ACTUALLY, UH,
WE HAD A FEELING

17:33.290 --> 17:34.871
THAT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE--
- WHO'S "WE"?

17:34.910 --> 17:38.209
- DAD AND I. WE HAD A FEELING
THAT, YOU KNOW...

17:38.260 --> 17:40.114
HONEY, HE'S YOUR DAD.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.152
IT IS WHAT IT IS,
YOU KNOW?

17:43.200 --> 17:46.328
IT IS WHAT IT IS,
SO IT'S OKAY.

17:49.790 --> 17:52.759

17:52.790 --> 17:54.166

17:54.210 --> 17:56.758
- NO.

17:56.790 --> 17:58.303
- ARE YOU BEING CAREFUL?

17:58.350 --> 18:00.341
ARE YOU USING A CONDOM, UM,
SOME SORT OF PROTECTION?

18:00.380 --> 18:02.200
- YES. YES.

18:02.250 --> 18:05.287

18:05.320 --> 18:08.118

18:12.290 --> 18:16.670

A FEELING...

18:16.710 --> 18:19.270
PARENTS' INTUITION.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.599
- OKAY.
WELL, THAT'S IT.

18:38.180 --> 18:41.240
- OKAY.

HE'S CUTE.

18:42.980 --> 18:46.188
- YEAH.

18:47.220 --> 18:49.222
- OH, HE WAVED.

18:49.260 --> 18:52.229
- I DON'T THINK HE SAW YOU.

18:52.260 --> 18:54.194
- YES, HE DID.

18:54.230 --> 18:56.881
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

18:56.920 --> 18:57.887
DAD.

18:57.920 --> 19:01.378

19:11.560 --> 19:13.653

THAT GENTLEMAN OVER THERE,

19:13.700 --> 19:15.247
GILLIAM T. BLOUNT?

19:15.290 --> 19:16.279

19:16.320 --> 19:18.254
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF...

19:18.290 --> 19:21.259

THAT WASN'T REALLY A REQUEST.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.179
I MEAN, DIDN'T HE GIVE YOU YOUR
FIRST BREAK IN SHOW BUSINESS?

19:24.230 --> 19:25.606

19:30.850 --> 19:33.330
- HE'S GONNA NEED
A LITTLE SOFTENING UP,

19:33.370 --> 19:35.679
BECAUSE OUR LAST EXCHANGE

VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

19:51.390 --> 19:52.254
- NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

19:52.290 --> 19:53.632

QUITE A UNIQUE PLAY--

19:53.670 --> 19:55.661
A COMBINATION OF
MILLER AND WASSERSTEIN.

19:55.710 --> 19:56.904
- WOW.
- IT'S FUNNY, AND...

19:56.950 --> 19:58.042
- I COULD NEVER LIVE
UP TO THAT.

19:58.090 --> 20:00.467
- THAT'S A RINGING ENDORSEMENT
FROM GILLIAM BLOUNT,

20:00.500 --> 20:01.842
WHO'S A LEGEND.

20:01.890 --> 20:03.915
I MEAN, IF WE ALL HAD
ONE-TENTH OF THE CAREER YOU HAD,

20:03.960 --> 20:05.678
GILLIAM, THEN I THINK
WE'D ALL BE VERY LUCKY.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.028
SO, GOOD LUCK.
THANKS FOR COMING TONIGHT.

20:07.060 --> 20:08.789
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

20:08.820 --> 20:11.641
- YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S ALL
ABOUT GLAD-HANDING TONIGHT.

20:11.690 --> 20:13.681
I REALLY CAN'T MAKE
THOSE PROMISES.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.517
GREAT TO MEET YOU.
- VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:15.550 --> 20:17.029
- JACK--JACK, DON'T.

20:17.070 --> 20:19.345
DON'T BLOW HER OFF
BECAUSE OF ME.

20:19.390 --> 20:21.767
- GILLIAM,
YOU'RE FORGETTING

20:21.800 --> 20:24.314
THAT YOU TOLD SAM SHEPARD
THAT I WAS INCOMPETENT.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.282
- YOU DID?

20:26.320 --> 20:29.562
- I TOLD HIM THAT YOU WEREN'T
RIGHT FOR THAT PARTICULAR PLAY.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.909
- YOU SAID "INCOMPETENT."
THAT'S WHAT YOU DID.

20:31.950 --> 20:35.010
- YES.
YES, I DID.

20:35.060 --> 20:37.984
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE,
AND NOW YOU'RE NOT.

20:38.020 --> 20:39.988
- THERE'S HOPE FOR US ALL,
THEN, I GUESS.

20:40.030 --> 20:40.883
- WOW, I MEAN...

20:40.920 --> 20:42.649
- REALLY GOOD MEETING YOU.
GOOD LUCK.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.308
HAVE SOME DRINKS.
SEE YOU ALL LATER.

20:49.350 --> 20:52.035
- JACK.
- OH, THERE HE IS.

20:52.070 --> 20:55.312
THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.
BYE-BYE.

20:57.320 --> 20:58.548

20:58.600 --> 21:01.046
MR., UH, KRAFT.
HI. HI.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.593

21:02.640 --> 21:06.280
I WANTED TO JUST SAY THAT I--
HAVING WORKED WITH GIL--

21:06.330 --> 21:09.049
KNOW WHAT AN INCREDIBLE
PILL HE CAN BE, AND I'M--

21:09.090 --> 21:10.318
- GIL THE PILL.

21:10.370 --> 21:13.407
- AND I'M SORRY FOR WHATEVER
THE HISTORY IS WITH YOU GUYS.

21:14.890 --> 21:17.051
- I HOPE THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO READ MY PLAY UNBIASED.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.068
- UH-HUH.

21:19.100 --> 21:20.442
- YEAH, I'M OKAY.
I'M NERVOUS.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.710
- WELL, I'VE GOT
AN ARMY OF READERS,

21:22.760 --> 21:24.307
AND THEY LOOK
AT ALL THE SUBMISSIONS,

21:24.350 --> 21:25.556
AND THE BEST ONES
END UP ON MY DESK,

21:25.590 --> 21:27.797
AND I READ THOSE UNBIASED.

21:27.830 --> 21:29.798
- OKAY, I DON'T WANT TO BE
READ BY THE ARMY.

21:29.840 --> 21:32.479
I WANT TO BE READ BY YOU.

21:32.530 --> 21:33.838

21:38.670 --> 21:41.082
SO, UH, WHERE MIGHT
I HAVE SEEN YOU WORK BEFORE?

21:41.120 --> 21:44.009
- [laughs]
- THAT'S FUNNY BECAUSE...?

21:44.060 --> 21:45.982
- NOWHERE.

21:46.020 --> 21:48.022
- YOU'VE NEVER HAD
A PLAY PRODUCED?

21:48.060 --> 21:49.948
- BETTER--I'VE NEVER
WRITTEN A PLAY BEFORE.

21:49.990 --> 21:52.049
- SO YOU'VE BEEN
ON THE EARTH A LONG TIME

21:52.100 --> 21:54.477
WITHOUT HAVING EVER
WRITTEN A PLAY.

21:54.520 --> 21:55.828
NO OFFENSE.

21:55.860 --> 21:58.966
- LISTEN, UH, YES, NO,
YOU'RE--YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.036
BUT, YOU KNOW, MARGARET EDSON
WROTE WITWHEN SHE WAS 35,

22:01.070 --> 22:02.935
AND SHE WAS
A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER,

22:02.970 --> 22:04.619
AND IT WON THE PULITZER PRIZE
IN 1999,

22:04.660 --> 22:06.389
SO I THINK YOU SHOULD, UH...
- I'M VERY AWARE OF WIT.

22:06.420 --> 22:09.799
- READ MY PLAY, PLEASE,
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN IT,

22:09.840 --> 22:12.764
AND IT IS
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.

22:14.670 --> 22:17.639
- WELL, UH, SARAH BRAVERMAN,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--

22:17.680 --> 22:19.910

22:59.720 --> 23:01.472

23:01.510 --> 23:06.129
AND WHAT WE THOUGHT
WE HEARD HER DOING...

23:06.170 --> 23:07.967
SHE'S DOING.

23:26.190 --> 23:29.079
- SO SHE'S HAVING SEX.

23:29.130 --> 23:30.574
- MM-HMM.

23:30.610 --> 23:33.192
- [scoffs]

23:36.170 --> 23:39.992

23:40.030 --> 23:42.726
ALL RIGHT, WELL, DID YOU
TELL HER TO USE PROTECTION?

23:42.760 --> 23:43.727
- I DID.

23:43.760 --> 23:44.749
- AND YOU TOLD HER TO DO IT

23:44.800 --> 23:45.937
BECAUSE SHE WANTS
TO BE DOING IT,

23:45.970 --> 23:48.143
AND BE DOING IT WITH SOMEBODY
THAT SHE CARES ABOUT...

23:48.180 --> 23:49.078
- SHE WANTS TO DO IT,

23:49.110 --> 23:51.590
AND I TALKED TO HER
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

23:51.630 --> 23:53.427
- ALL RIGHT.

23:57.190 --> 24:01.012
YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S IT, THEN.

24:12.140 --> 24:13.892
- YEAH,
THAT WAS KAREN'S, RIGHT?

24:13.930 --> 24:15.989
KAREN, YOU'RE A GENIUS.

AND I CAN'T STOP.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.821

THAT'S EXCELLENT.

24:53.870 --> 24:57.317

I DIDN'T HIRE SPIDER-MAN.

25:18.580 --> 25:21.196
I HIRED SPYDER, MAN.
ISN'T THAT INSPIRING, MAN?

25:21.240 --> 25:23.026

25:25.900 --> 25:28.653
EDDIE'S THE HEAD

26:27.930 --> 26:30.717
- OKAY, I'M--I'M SORRY TO...

26:30.760 --> 26:34.059
I DON'T WANT TO OVERSTEP
MY BOUNDS HERE...

26:34.100 --> 26:35.419
BUT, UM...
- IT'S OKAY.

26:35.450 --> 26:37.304
- HE'S JUST REALLY DIFFERENT.

26:37.350 --> 26:39.136
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
LIKE THIS.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.273
HE'S REALLY...

26:41.320 --> 26:45.142
HE'S GROWN UP
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

26:45.180 --> 26:49.355
SO I THOUGHT
THAT WAS WORTH MENTIONING.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.220
- I'M GLAD FOR HIM,

26:51.260 --> 26:54.946
BUT IT'S TOO BAD HE DIDN'T
GROW UP A FEW WEEKS EARLIER.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.328
- YEAH.

26:58.370 --> 27:00.713
WELL...

27:00.750 --> 27:04.095
HE REALLY LOVES YOU.

27:04.130 --> 27:06.098
- I LOVE HIM TOO.

27:06.140 --> 27:08.722
BUT I'M SO ANGRY AT HIM,

27:08.760 --> 27:12.139
I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER
NOT BE ANGRY AT HIM.

27:15.180 --> 27:18.069
[sighs]
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, JULIA.

27:18.110 --> 27:21.318
I'M SORRY.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.942
I'LL SEE YOU
AFTER DINNER, OKAY?

27:23.980 --> 27:26.426
- YEAH. BYE.

27:39.860 --> 27:42.090
- GOOD CHICKEN, HUH?

27:42.140 --> 27:46.486
- UM, I SCORED THREE GOALS
AT SOCCER TODAY.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.203
- THAT'S GREAT.
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

27:48.250 --> 27:50.241
- THAT'S COOL,
BUT DID YOU WIN?

27:50.280 --> 27:52.077
- YEAH, WE WON.

27:52.110 --> 27:54.214

SOCCER'S GOING REALLY WELL.

27:54.250 --> 27:56.878
- YEAH. PRETTY GOOD.

27:56.910 --> 27:59.492

3,400,065 CHICKENS
ARE SLAUGHTERED DAILY

28:03.230 --> 28:05.152
JUST TO MEET THE DEMANDS
OF THE WORLD EVERY DAY?

28:05.200 --> 28:07.225
- MAX, DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT
WHEN YOU'RE EATING CHICKEN.

28:07.270 --> 28:09.090
- IT'S NOT GONNA BRING
THE CHICKEN BACK TO LIFE.

28:09.130 --> 28:10.233
WHERE'D YOU READ THAT?

28:10.270 --> 28:13.068
- UH,
THE ANNUAL FARMING REPORT.

28:13.100 --> 28:15.261
- HMM. INTERESTING.

28:15.310 --> 28:18.279

THAT CHICKENS WITH RED EARLOBES

28:18.310 --> 28:19.720
LAY BROWN EGGS,

28:19.760 --> 28:22.342
AND CHICKENS WITH WHITE EARLOBES
LAY WHITE EGGS.

28:22.390 --> 28:23.243
- A LOT OF GOOD FACTS.

28:23.280 --> 28:26.727
- SO HADDIE SCORED
THREE TIMES TODAY.

28:26.770 --> 28:29.216
I CAN'T BEL--I MEAN,
I'VE NEVER EVEN SCORED ONCE,

28:29.250 --> 28:31.901
AND HADDIE SCORED
THREE TIMES IN ONE DAY.

28:31.950 --> 28:33.258
THAT'S AMAZING.

28:33.290 --> 28:36.259
[Hugo's Bread and Butter]

28:42.300 --> 28:45.235
- SHE TASTES LIKE MIDNIGHT

28:45.270 --> 28:48.194
SHE TASTES LIKE WINE

28:48.240 --> 28:50.026
SHE TASTES LIKE MIDNIGHT

28:50.070 --> 28:51.298
SHE TASTES LIKE WINE

28:51.350 --> 28:53.341
- IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD
DOING THIS IN HERE.

28:53.380 --> 28:55.416
IT'S LIKE MY FAMILY'S
WATCHING OR SOMETHING.

28:55.450 --> 28:58.146

29:16.540 --> 29:18.474
I HAVE
A STUPID DINNER THINGY

29:18.510 --> 29:20.785
THAT I-I PROMISED MY MOM

29:43.160 --> 29:44.843
IT'S A CRAZY STORY.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.108
IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY,
ACTUALLY.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.128
- YOU DON'T WRITE, YOU DON'T
CALL, YOU DON'T SEND FLOWERS.

29:48.160 --> 29:49.889
- MY FRIEND GARY
TOOK ME TO THE WRONG PLACE.

29:49.920 --> 29:50.989
- WHO'S GARY?
WHO'S GARY?

29:51.030 --> 29:52.224
- JUST MY FRIEND.
SO WE WERE LIKE--

29:52.270 --> 29:54.192

A NEW SPECIAL FRIEND?

29:54.240 --> 29:55.616
- NO, JUST A FRIEND.
LISTEN.

29:55.650 --> 29:57.857
AND HE THOUGHT
HE KNEW WHERE IT WAS,

29:57.890 --> 29:59.926
AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS
THIS PLACE ACROSS THE STREET,

29:59.970 --> 30:01.346
AND WE WENT IN THERE,
AND THERE WAS, LIKE,

30:01.380 --> 30:02.347
A QUINCEAERAOR SOMETHING?

30:02.380 --> 30:04.268

30:04.310 --> 30:05.379
PEOPLE IN FLUFFY DRESSES.

30:05.420 --> 30:07.934
IT'S, LIKE,
A BIRTHDAY PARTY,

30:07.970 --> 30:09.835
AND THERE WAS, LIKE,
SINGING IN SPANISH, AND...

30:09.870 --> 30:11.314
[laughter]

30:11.360 --> 30:13.248
AND THERE WAS A CAKE,

30:13.290 --> 30:15.975
AND IT HAD A PICTURE
OF THIS GIRL...

30:16.020 --> 30:17.590
IT WAS SO WEIRD,

30:17.640 --> 30:20.188
BUT, ANYWAY, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA BE IN THERE,

30:20.230 --> 30:22.881
AND YOU WEREN'T IN THERE.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.364
IT WAS SO WEIRD.
YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED IT.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.220
I WISH
YOU COULD HAVE SEEN IT.

30:26.270 --> 30:29.569
OH, MY GOD. IT WAS...

THAT BIG OF A DEAL, OKAY?

30:44.980 --> 30:46.595

30:57.920 --> 31:00.434
YOU'VE GOT TWO MINUTES
TO COME TO THE CAR.

31:00.470 --> 31:02.927
- THAT'S NOT EVEN
ENOUGH TIME FOR OYSTERS.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.337
COME ON.

31:15.010 --> 31:16.318

31:48.320 --> 31:50.276
LISTEN, I'M SORRY
ABOUT EVERYTHING WITH DAD.

31:50.320 --> 31:51.526
I KNOW THINGS
ARE TENSE AND AWKWARD--

31:51.560 --> 31:53.528
- I JUST WISH
THAT I HADN'T TOLD YOU.

31:53.560 --> 31:56.040
- HONEY, I'M SO GLAD
THAT YOU TOLD ME.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.423
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- WELL, I WISH I DIDN'T.

31:58.460 --> 32:01.111
I WISH I DIDN'T,
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND...

32:01.160 --> 32:03.390
- WHAT? NO.
- WHY, LIKE, EVERY INTERACTION

32:03.430 --> 32:06.228
THAT I HAVE WITH DAD
IS, LIKE, HIM JUST JUDGING ME.

32:06.260 --> 32:09.195
- HE'S NOT JUDGING YOU
AT ALL, HONEY.

32:09.230 --> 32:10.299
- YEAH, WELL,
IT FEELS LIKE THAT,

32:10.340 --> 32:13.548
AND IT JUST
MAKES ME FEEL SAD.

32:13.580 --> 32:15.195
- HONEY,
NOBODY'S JUDGING YOU.

32:15.240 --> 32:18.539
I MEAN,
YOU'RE OUR BABY, YOU KNOW?

32:21.590 --> 32:24.104
AND WE WISH
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE WAITED.

32:24.140 --> 32:27.314
THAT'S ALL.

32:27.350 --> 32:31.764
BUT I PROMISE YOU
HE'LL COME AROUND.

32:31.810 --> 32:33.209
I PROMISE.

32:33.260 --> 32:36.707
COME HERE.
GIVE ME A HUG.

32:36.740 --> 32:38.423
I LOVE YOU.

32:38.470 --> 32:40.609

32:43.580 --> 32:46.504

32:46.550 --> 32:48.506

32:48.550 --> 32:50.472

32:50.520 --> 32:54.308
I WAS--I WAS 15.

32:54.350 --> 32:56.204
IT WAS AWFUL.

32:56.250 --> 32:57.410
IT WAS WITH THIS BOY
NAMED ROY.

32:57.450 --> 32:59.202
ANYWAY, I THOUGHT
I WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM,

32:59.250 --> 33:00.649
AND HE WENT TO SCHOOL
THE NEXT DAY

33:00.700 --> 33:03.692
AND TOLD EVERYBODY
THAT WE DID IT,

33:03.740 --> 33:05.731
AND IT WAS JUST AWFUL.

33:05.770 --> 33:09.046
- OH.
- I KNOW.

33:09.090 --> 33:12.981
I'M JUST HAPPY THAT IT
WAS DIFFERENT FOR YOU.

33:17.610 --> 33:19.293
- WELL, WHAT DID
YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT?

33:19.340 --> 33:21.262
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER
ABOUT THE HOUSE, DID YOU?

33:21.300 --> 33:22.813
- NO, I DIDN'T TELL HER
ABOUT THE HOUSE.

33:22.860 --> 33:24.543
WE WEREN'T TALKING
ABOUT THAT AT ALL.

33:24.580 --> 33:25.444
I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.

33:25.480 --> 33:27.163
- WELL, THEN WHY
ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME

33:27.210 --> 33:29.166
LIKE MY DOG WAS RUN OVER
OR SOMETHING?

33:29.210 --> 33:30.416
- [sighs]

33:30.450 --> 33:32.202
WELL, YOU KNOW...

33:32.250 --> 33:34.696
SHE'S NOT EXACTLY
ON THE SAME PAGE AS YOU.

33:34.730 --> 33:36.482
I THINK YOU SHOULD START
TO CONSIDER...

33:36.530 --> 33:37.724
- YEAH, WELL,
LISTEN, YOU KNOW,

33:37.770 --> 33:39.692
A RELATIONSHIP'S
BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE,

33:39.740 --> 33:41.628
SO I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU SHOULD BE GETTING INVOLVED.

33:41.670 --> 33:43.251
- CROSBY,
I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP.

33:43.290 --> 33:45.349
I KNOW. I MEAN, I'M NOT
A COMPLETE IDIOT

33:45.400 --> 33:46.469
ON THIS SUBJECT.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.434
- YEAH, I KNOW
YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP,

33:48.470 --> 33:49.459
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT MIGHT JUST BE

33:49.510 --> 33:51.535
THAT I KNOW MORE
ABOUT JASMINE THAN YOU, OKAY?

33:51.580 --> 33:54.401
- CROSBY, SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE WITH YOU.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.055
SHE SAID
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.237
- YEAH, NO KIDDING, JULIA.

33:57.270 --> 33:58.749
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I'M DOING HERE?

33:58.790 --> 34:00.712
I SOLD MY HOUSEBOAT
AND MY MOTORCYCLE

34:00.760 --> 34:02.682
AND BOUGHT
THIS PIECE-OF-CRAP HOUSE.

34:02.730 --> 34:05.062
THERE'S NO OPTIONS LEFT.

34:05.110 --> 34:07.385
THIS IS THE HAIL MARY PASS.
THERE'S NO TIME LEFT.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.729
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
SOMETIMES HAIL MARY PASSES WORK.

34:09.770 --> 34:11.488
AND THEY'RE AMAZING
WHEN THEY DO.

34:11.530 --> 34:13.737
EVERYONE CHEERS,
AND PEOPLE WIN.

34:13.770 --> 34:15.624
LOOK, IT'S A LONG SHOT.

34:15.670 --> 34:18.321
I RECOGNIZE THAT,
BUT IT MIGHT JUST WORK.

34:18.360 --> 34:21.158
AND I HAVE TO BELIEVE
IT MIGHT WORK,

34:21.190 --> 34:24.193
SO, PLEASE, JUST LET ME
BELIEVE THAT.

34:36.550 --> 34:38.723
- HI.
- HEY.

34:38.760 --> 34:40.136
WHAT?

34:40.180 --> 34:41.829
- YOU NEED TO TALK TO HER.

34:41.870 --> 34:45.317
SHE THINKS THAT YOU'RE
COMPLETELY ANGRY WITH HER, OKAY?

34:45.350 --> 34:47.864
SHE'S HUMILIATED, AND...
- HUMILIATED? WHY?

34:47.910 --> 34:49.593
- YOU'RE NOT TALKING
TO HER, ADAM.

34:49.630 --> 34:51.257
- I AM TALKING TO HER.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.258
- YOU HAVEN'T SAID TWO WORDS
TO THE GIRL THE WHOLE WEEK.

34:53.290 --> 34:54.871
IT'S JUST LIKE
I'M HAVING TO DEFEND YOU.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.774
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY TO HER, KRISTINA, OKAY?

34:56.810 --> 34:57.913
- YOU KNEW
THAT THIS DAY WOULD COME.

34:57.950 --> 34:59.770
- WELL, I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS GONNA COME THIS FAST,

34:59.820 --> 35:00.844
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HER, OKAY?

35:00.890 --> 35:02.460
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO--
GIVE HER A HIGH FIVE

35:02.510 --> 35:04.125
AND CONGRATULATE HER
FOR HAVING SEX?

35:04.170 --> 35:05.239
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.784
YOU'RE SHUTTING HER OUT
COMPLETELY.

35:12.380 --> 35:14.200
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY TO HER, KRISTINA.

35:14.250 --> 35:16.343
I'M SORRY.

35:16.390 --> 35:18.551
- THANKS, ADAM.

35:26.710 --> 35:28.325
I...

35:28.360 --> 35:29.918
- DO YOU REANIOY NOT KNOW?

35:29.950 --> 35:31.804
- WHEN YOU SAY DRUGS,
DO YOU MEAN JUST POT?

35:31.850 --> 35:33.772
- I DON'T KNOW--
- WHAT HAS SHE TOLD YOU?

35:33.820 --> 35:35.845
- ALL I KNOW IS SOME GUY...
[cell phone ringing]

35:35.890 --> 35:36.879

SHE NEEDS A RIDE, ACTUALLY.

35:45.210 --> 35:46.165
SO, YEAH.

35:46.210 --> 35:47.723
- ALL RIGHT, MAN, LATER.

35:47.760 --> 35:48.988
- HEY, WHAT THE HELL

35:49.040 --> 35:51.486
- I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU GO OUT
WITH SOME GUY AND DO DRUGS.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.341
- THAT'S MY PHONE.
I TOLD YOU THAT IN PRIVACY.

35:54.390 --> 35:55.869
- DON'T YOU GUYS FIGHT.
IT'S YOUR FAULT.

35:55.910 --> 35:58.185
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S CAUSING ALL OF THIS!

35:58.220 --> 36:01.280
- WHAT IS THIS?
ARE YOU GOING THROUGH MY STUFF?

36:01.330 --> 36:03.184
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
THIS IS MY STUFF.

36:03.230 --> 36:04.299
I TRUSTED YOU!
- WHAT'S IN HERE?

36:04.330 --> 36:05.979
NOW I HAVE
TO QUESTION EVERYTHING.

36:06.020 --> 36:08.705
- IT'S MINTS, YOU IDIOT.
- DON'T CALL ME AN IDIOT.

36:08.750 --> 36:11.332
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANWVHERE.
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?

36:11.370 --> 36:13.258
COME BACK HERE!
COME BACK HERE!

36:13.300 --> 36:15.951
YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL!

36:16.000 --> 36:17.399
- I'M GOING OUT.

36:17.450 --> 36:19.236
- GREAT.
SO THAT'S YOUR PLAN?

36:19.280 --> 36:20.656
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FINISH
HIGH SCHOOL.

36:20.690 --> 36:21.998
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO
TO COLLEGE.

36:22.040 --> 36:23.553
OH, THIS MUST BE GARY.

36:23.590 --> 36:25.342
I'M NOT LETTING YOU LEAVE
WITH THIS LOSER.

36:25.390 --> 36:26.584
- STOP!

36:26.630 --> 36:28.245
-AAH!

36:28.280 --> 36:29.907
- WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

36:29.940 --> 36:32.249
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?
- LEAVE ME ALONE.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.211
DON'T ATTACK ME!

36:33.260 --> 36:35.285
- AMBER, WHAT ARE YOU--
MOM, ARE YOU OKAY?

36:35.330 --> 36:37.389
- YOU JUST ATTACKED ME.
GO. GO.

36:37.430 --> 36:39.534
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

36:46.990 --> 36:48.025
- I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

36:48.060 --> 36:49.368
I'VE CALLED 15 TIMES NOW,

36:49.410 --> 36:50.957
AND I JUST WANT TO HEAR
THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.922
THAT'S ALL. I JUST WANT TO HEAR
THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.894
I LOVE YOU. HI.
THIS IS REALLY NOT A GOOD TIME.

36:54.930 --> 36:56.682
- UM, YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE

36:56.730 --> 36:58.618
PUT OFF WHAT'S
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM

36:58.660 --> 37:01.003
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO TERRIFIED
THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA DIE?

37:01.040 --> 37:02.029
- I DO. YES.

37:02.080 --> 37:03.832
- THE NEW TITLE OF THE PLAY--

37:03.870 --> 37:05.667
A STORY FOR ANOTHER DAY.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.008
- I LIKE IT.
THAT'S GREAT.

37:07.050 --> 37:08.904
LET ME CALL YOU LATER.

37:08.950 --> 37:10.975
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.295
- UH, ONE MORE LITTLE THING.

37:13.330 --> 37:14.843
THEY WANT US.
WE'RE IN.

37:14.880 --> 37:15.699
- WHO?

37:15.750 --> 37:19.743
- MR. KRAFT,
THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR.

37:19.780 --> 37:21.475
HELLO?
HE LIKED IT.

37:21.510 --> 37:23.478
WE'RE IN THE READING SERIES.

37:23.510 --> 37:24.954
- HE LIKED IT?

37:25.000 --> 37:27.992
- YEAH, HE LIKED IT.

37:28.030 --> 37:29.759
OKAY. OKAY.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.894
UM, AT SOME FUTURE DATE,

37:31.930 --> 37:33.818
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT
TO GIVE ME A PRESENT.

37:33.870 --> 37:35.690
DON'T THINK ABOUT FLOWERS.
- OKAY.

37:35.730 --> 37:37.038
- THINK ABOUT
SINGLE-MALT WHISKEY.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.763
- RIGHT.
- THANK YOU.

37:38.800 --> 37:41.451
- THANK YOU.

37:43.910 --> 37:45.730
IT WAS TERRIBLE.
IT WAS BRUTAL.

37:45.780 --> 37:46.940
- AND THEN SHE JUST
TOOK OFF WITH THE GUY?

37:46.980 --> 37:48.356
- YEAH.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.743
- WELL, I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE.
YOU CALLED HER?

37:50.780 --> 37:52.884
- ADAM, THIS IS NOT
THE SAME THING.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.571
THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE.
I MEAN...

37:55.610 --> 37:58.716
HONESTLY, THERE'S A PART
OF ME THAT WONDERS...

37:58.750 --> 38:00.547
IF SHE'LL COME BACK.

38:00.580 --> 38:02.548
- LOOK, SARAH,
THEY'RE TEENAGERS.

38:02.590 --> 38:03.784
THIS IS WHAT THEY DO.

38:03.830 --> 38:05.923
THEY PUSH AGAINST US.
THEY REBEL, YOU KNOW?

38:05.970 --> 38:08.347
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE CRAP THAT
HADDIE'S PULLED THIS YEAR...

38:08.380 --> 38:10.519
- NO OFFENSE, ADAM, BUT THAT
STUFF IS SO MUCH MORE NORMAL.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.448
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S DATING A GUY.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.936
OH, YOU KNOW, SO...

38:14.980 --> 38:17.562
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
HADDIE AND ALEX

38:17.600 --> 38:19.488
ARE DOING A LOT MORE
THAN DATING NOW.

38:19.530 --> 38:21.919
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH.

38:21.950 --> 38:22.939
- OH, WELL...

38:22.990 --> 38:24.673
- SHE'S 16 YEARS OLD.

38:24.710 --> 38:26.598
SHE'S HAVING SEX, AND THERE'S
NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.813
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO
SAY SOMETHING TO HER ABOUT IT,

38:28.850 --> 38:29.839
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

38:29.890 --> 38:31.744
- IS SHE HAPPY?
- COME ON, SARAH.

38:31.790 --> 38:32.711
PLEASE DON'T ASK ME THAT.

38:32.750 --> 38:34.615
YEAH, SHE'S HAPPY.
SHE'S REAL SATISFIED.

38:34.650 --> 38:35.958
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.513
I JUST MEAN AT LEAST
THEY LOVE EACH OTHER,

38:37.550 --> 38:38.824
AND SHE'S BEING HONEST
WITH YOU.

38:38.860 --> 38:40.725
IT'S A LOT BETTER
THAN THE WAY AMBER STARTED.

38:43.940 --> 38:46.317
- NICE.
THANKS FOR THE PLATE.

38:49.490 --> 38:51.663
YOU KNOW, IT WAS SO NICE
WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE KID,

38:51.700 --> 38:53.144
AND I COULD JUST SIT WITH HER

38:53.190 --> 38:54.839
AND HAVE A PEANUT BUTTER
AND JELLY SANDWICH

38:54.880 --> 38:57.041
AND MAKE FACES AT HER
AND MAKE HER LAUGH.

38:57.090 --> 38:59.320
NICE AND SIMPLE.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.879
- I KNOW IT DOESN'T HELP NOW,

39:03.920 --> 39:07.026
BUT I REALIZE
I MADE A MISTAKE.

39:07.060 --> 39:09.995
- I DON'T THINK SO.

39:10.030 --> 39:12.134
- I LET HER TELL ME
WHEN SHE WAS READY TO GROW UP,

39:12.170 --> 39:14.058
AND...

39:14.110 --> 39:17.580
I SHOULD HAVE FOUGHT
HER MORE.

39:17.630 --> 39:20.963
- LOOK, I'VE BEEN DEALING
WITH THIS STUFF WITH HADDIE.

39:21.010 --> 39:23.171
EVERY TIME I GET INTO A CONFLICT
WITH HER, ENGAGE,

39:23.220 --> 39:24.733
LEADS NOWHERE.

39:24.770 --> 39:26.044
SEEMS LIKE
THE BEST THING I CAN DO

39:26.080 --> 39:27.729
IS JUST TO GIVE HER SPACE.

39:27.770 --> 39:30.944
- NO.
YOU DON'T GIVE THEM SPACE.

39:30.980 --> 39:32.845
JUST WHEN THEY TELL YOU
THEY DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE

39:32.880 --> 39:35.599
IS EXACTLY WHEN
THEY NEED YOU THE MOST.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.882
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT IT.
YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.888
IT'S WHEN THEY'RE
PUSHING YOU AWAY.

39:40.930 --> 39:42.784
IT'S WHEN THEY'RE TELLING YOU
THEY KNOW BETTER.

39:42.820 --> 39:45.402
THAT'S WHEN
YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP.

39:45.450 --> 39:49.921
NOW I'M...
AFRAID IT'S TOO LATE.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.941
- IF I WAS OLDER NOW

40:09.990 --> 40:11.981
I COULD GIVE YOU ADVICE

40:12.030 --> 40:14.055
- OH, MY DAD'S HERE.
I GUESS HE'S GONNA PICK ME UP.

40:14.100 --> 40:16.125
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS.

40:16.170 --> 40:18.752
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HEY.

40:18.790 --> 40:21.509
UH, I JUST TOOK OFF WORK EARLY.
I WANTED TO PICK YOU UP.

40:21.550 --> 40:23.518
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR ELBOW THERE?

40:23.550 --> 40:24.414
YOU'RE BLEEDING, KIDDO.
- OH, YEAH.

40:24.450 --> 40:25.894
- YEAH, LET ME GET
THE FIRST-AID KIT.

40:25.940 --> 40:26.964
- DAD.
- YEAH.

40:27.010 --> 40:28.830
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
IT'S, LIKE, A TINY THING.

40:28.870 --> 40:30.246
WE'LL JUST CLEAN IT OFF
AT HOME.

40:30.280 --> 40:31.929
IT'S JUST, LIKE, DRIED,
GOOPY BLOOD.

40:31.980 --> 40:34.210
- YEAH, WELL, WE DON'T WANT THAT
TO GET INFECTED, ALL RIGHT?

40:34.250 --> 40:35.945
- IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE IT WOULD, BUT, YEAH.

40:35.980 --> 40:37.629
THIS IS UNNECESSARY.

40:37.670 --> 40:39.877
HONESTLY, IT'S, LIKE,
A TEENY GUY RIGHT THERE.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.467
- YOU DON'T WANT
THAT FLESH-EATING BACTERIA

40:41.500 --> 40:42.944
TO GET IN THERE.
- OKAY.

40:42.990 --> 40:47.575
- ALL RIGHT?

40:47.610 --> 40:49.123
JUST, UH...

40:55.240 --> 40:58.653
I JUST DON'T EVER WANT
YOU TO GET HURT, HADDIE.

41:03.210 --> 41:06.008
THAT'S ALL.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.598
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT?

41:07.630 --> 41:09.803
- YEAH.

41:09.840 --> 41:11.899
- YOU WANT TO GET
AN ICE CREAM OR SOMETHING?

41:11.950 --> 41:12.939
- YEAH!
- YEAH?

41:12.980 --> 41:14.971
- LET'S DO IT.
LET'S GO TO THE MOVIES. CAN WE?

41:15.020 --> 41:16.772
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
I GOT TIME FOR THAT.

41:16.810 --> 41:18.914
- AND, YOU KNOW, SHE MAKES ME
FEEL LIKE MY WHOLE LIFE IS OVER

41:18.950 --> 41:20.838
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT GOING TO COLLEGE.

41:20.890 --> 41:22.221
THERE'S OTHER OPTIONS.

41:22.270 --> 41:23.885
YOU KNOW, I DON'T JUST HAVE
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

41:23.920 --> 41:25.615
- WELL, NOT EVERYONE GOES TO
COLLEGE. IT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.060
- NO, I MEAN, LIKE,
I COULD PLAY MUSIC

41:27.100 --> 41:28.510
OR, YOU KNOW--
OR TRAVELING.

41:28.550 --> 41:29.824
- YEAH, TRAVELING.

41:29.860 --> 41:31.725
I WISH I'D TRAVELED. I HAVEN'T
EVEN LEFT THE COUNTRY BEFORE.

41:31.760 --> 41:33.170
- ME EITHER.
I WANT TO GO.

41:33.210 --> 41:34.939
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE SHOULD JUST GO.

41:34.970 --> 41:38.554
WE SHOULD JUST GO TO EUROPE.
- I MEAN, IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

41:38.590 --> 41:40.694
- GO TO SPAIN,
YOU KNOW?

41:40.730 --> 41:41.549
- SPAIN?
- YEAH.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.737
YOU COULD BE, LIKE,
A, YOU KNOW--

41:42.770 --> 41:45.898
A FLAMENCO DANCER WITH A FLOWER
IN YOUR EAR, YOU KNOW?

41:45.950 --> 41:47.520
I COULD BE A MATADOR.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

41:47.570 --> 41:49.151
WHY NOT?

41:49.190 --> 41:51.704
[tires screeching]

41:51.750 --> 41:54.059
[horn blaring]
