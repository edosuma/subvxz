WEBVTT

00:16.640 --> 00:20.080
[Muffled screams]

00:20.410 --> 00:24.410
[Heavy breathing]

00:25.000 --> 00:27.920
[Muffled voices]

00:31.270 --> 00:32.400
[Chloe] Ed?

00:33.200 --> 00:34.320
[Chloe] Ed?

00:34.320 --> 00:36.280
[Ed] Chloe?
 [Footsteps - running]

00:36.360 --> 00:37.880
[Chloe] It's happening again.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.050
[Distant singing]

01:01.050 --> 01:02.630
[Ed] That's about twenty feet.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.030
[Ed] Are you still getting this?

01:12.700 --> 01:15.160
[Ed] It's er... It's open.

01:16.770 --> 01:18.160
[Deep breath]
[Ed] Okay.

01:21.660 --> 01:23.120
What have we got to do now?

01:23.420 --> 01:25.320
[Chloe] Start with your name.

01:27.340 --> 01:29.200
My name's Ed Dickens.

01:30.460 --> 01:34.180
Currently staying at 7 [redacted].

01:37.600 --> 01:40.000
[Chloe] And what is it you're about to do?

01:41.660 --> 01:44.640
I'm about to break into 9 [redacted].

01:49.860 --> 01:52.200
We've got to do this, we've got no choice.

01:54.320 --> 01:56.600
We've got to find out what the fuck is going on.

01:56.640 --> 01:59.440
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

02:00.500 --> 02:04.960
- You uploaded the other videos yet?
- Shit, no. I'll do that now.
- Okay.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.180
[Chloe] - Hi
- Hi [Clears throat]

02:33.980 --> 02:38.680
- So am I the topic of the documentary then?
[Chloe] - No.

02:38.860 --> 02:41.910
- What happened to the camera anyway?
[Chloe] - It got stolen.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.540
Alright, okay. [Clears throat]

02:44.090 --> 02:47.100
- Shall I
[Chloe] - Shall I erm... we'll go film yeah?
- Do it, yeah, yeah.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.600
[Chloe] It's not. You've got it on.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.820
How's it look?

02:54.020 --> 02:58.150
[Ed] Yeah, no, no, just keep blowing the smoke
 into the lens and fucking up the focus.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.190
- Better for you?
[Ed] - That looks so much better.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.240
[Ed] You should quit, you know that, right?

03:03.690 --> 03:05.840
[Chloe] - I want this film to be about Amelia.

03:05.880 --> 03:09.980
Who Amelia was. What she
meant to her family. To my family.

03:09.980 --> 03:12.030
And what her disappearing left behind.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.640
I think it's weird that no-one has
spoken about it for so long.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.870
No one knows what happened to
her and no one seems to care.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.300
[Ed] Maybe there's a reason for that?

03:20.380 --> 03:24.580
Well, maybe there is and I want to find out.
That's what this film will be about.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.350
Kind of the not-knowing.

03:26.430 --> 03:28.520
[Ed] - What do you want to do now?
- Shit!

03:28.590 --> 03:30.480
[Car horn beeps]
[Ed] - What are doing?

03:32.620 --> 03:36.940
[Ed] Oh! [Laughs]
Oh my fucking God.

03:37.020 --> 03:41.740
[Ed] Oh God, okay, okay.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.060
[Ed] - Hi Mrs Webber
[Kimberley] - Ed!

03:44.820 --> 03:49.450
[Kimberley]- How long's it been?
[Ed] - Oh y'know, just a couple of months.
Three months I think.

03:49.450 --> 03:52.090
Three months? That long?

03:52.200 --> 03:55.520
[Kimberley] - You two want something to eat?
[Ed] - Yeah.

03:55.660 --> 03:59.000
Chloe] - Mum, we're filming.
Alright. What are you filming?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.640
[Chloe] - Something for our final project.
- Okay.

04:01.660 --> 04:05.260
- You want something?
[Ed] - I would love something, Mrs Webber.
- Alright, alright.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.060
[Ed] - Have you done something to your hair?
 It looks great.
- Stop it.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.040
[Ed] Phoah!

04:11.160 --> 04:13.060
- Don't start.
[laughs]

04:13.060 --> 04:14.700
You are so disgusting.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.899
[Ed] Me and her tonight it's on.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.279
- No, she's my mum.
[Ed] - Get some R. Kelly. I won't piss on her though.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.950
[Ed] - The way you threw that cigarette.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.720
[Ed] - It was like a professional javelin thrower.
 It was ridiculous.

04:24.720 --> 04:25.600
Oh come on.

04:25.600 --> 04:29.720
[Ed] - Why don't you tell her? I don't understand.
- Because it's none of your business, that's why.

04:29.780 --> 04:31.260
[Ed] - None of my business?
- Yeah.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.810
- Did you get that all on camera?
[Ed] - Of course I got it all on camera.

04:33.820 --> 04:36.320
- But seriously, did you get it all on camera?
[Ed] - Oh yeah.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.140
[Ed] I mean you've got to be careful Webber.

04:38.170 --> 04:40.590
[Ed] You never know whose watching
when you're up to no good.

04:40.620 --> 04:42.410
[Ed] Dun dun duh!

04:42.780 --> 04:46.300
[Chloe] I've got pictures of her here...
playing in this room.

04:46.320 --> 04:52.460
And I've got pictures of her as well opening her
christmas presents under the tree in the corner.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.640
This is the last picture taken of her.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.700
[Chloe] It was used in the press.

05:00.030 --> 05:02.120
[Chloe] Shall we got outside and do the intro?

05:03.040 --> 05:05.280
[Chloe] July 14th 1984.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.240
[Chloe] A small street in the
village of Cold Christmas...

05:09.380 --> 05:11.160
Oh ff- [laughs]

05:11.420 --> 05:13.120
I don't think this is working.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.540
Right.

05:14.540 --> 05:17.080
I'm just going to walk up here.
I want you to follow me.

05:17.340 --> 05:19.230
[Chloe] July 14th 1984.

05:19.260 --> 05:22.360
[Chloe] A small street in the
village of Cold Christmas.

05:22.400 --> 05:27.220
Amelia Wells says "Good evening" to her
parents, steps out onto the street

05:27.220 --> 05:29.220
and is never seen again.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.400
Her little sister, grew up to be my mother.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.850
My name is Chloe Webber and
Amelia Wells was my aunt.

05:36.020 --> 05:38.880
[Chloe] - Right, be careful of the bed.
- Of what?

05:39.040 --> 05:40.900
[Chloe] - Of the bed! [laughs]
- Oh alright.

05:40.900 --> 05:42.840
[Thud]
Ow! Ow! Ow!

05:44.900 --> 05:46.060
Wow.

05:46.060 --> 05:48.980
Mate, you were right, this is like a time capsule.
This is so weird.

05:48.980 --> 05:53.020
Oh wait really? You literally left that open.
Are you still doing the WEBcasting?

05:53.040 --> 05:56.800
[Chloe] Yeah of course I am.
I've got 300 followers now.

05:56.880 --> 06:00.140
- 300? Wow! That's great!
[Chloe] - Shut up!

06:00.220 --> 06:03.260
[Chloe] - Don't you watch them?
- What? No.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.560
I mean, maybe one.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.860
[Chloe] It's pretty cool huh?

06:07.920 --> 06:09.660
It's pretty creepy as well.

06:09.860 --> 06:12.300
When I was little, this room was off limits.

06:12.580 --> 06:16.540
I'd sneak in here and my mum would
scream at me if I got caught.

06:17.080 --> 06:20.840
[Ed] And how does she feel about it now?
Now that you're sleeping in here?

06:22.360 --> 06:25.860
Anytime I'm not around she
comes in here and tidies up.

06:26.420 --> 06:29.700
[Chloe] - It's like she wants sit to be as
un-lived in as possible.
[Ed] - [Chuckle]

06:30.460 --> 06:36.560
[Chloe] She drew, she wrote, she's all these things
and then one day - she just isn't here anymore.

06:38.580 --> 06:42.120
[Ed] How does anyone move on
 with a room like this in their house?

06:44.920 --> 06:47.680
[Chloe] I think they just expected her to come back.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.640
I think they still do.

06:57.400 --> 07:01.200
Granddad, this is my friend Ed.

07:01.300 --> 07:05.700
We go to college together. Isn't that right Ed?

07:05.700 --> 07:07.700
[Ed] Do we?

07:07.760 --> 07:11.180
- Talk to him!
[Ed] - What do you... erm...

07:11.220 --> 07:16.140
[Ed] Hey Joe, oh, what you looking at outside mate?

07:16.150 --> 07:17.740
[Chloe] It's his favourite spot.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.660
[Chloe] If we move him anywhere else
he gets really really grumpy.

07:21.660 --> 07:23.140
[Ed] Is that so?

07:23.140 --> 07:26.220
[Joe] [Groan]

07:27.120 --> 07:29.780
It's fine he does it all the time.

07:35.120 --> 07:39.480
[Ed] - Are you having a giggle! Look at that mattress!
It's so fruity it hurts.
[Chloe] - It's fine, Look!

07:39.490 --> 07:42.210
[Chloe] It's absolutely fine,
I've slept on it hundreds of times.

07:42.220 --> 07:45.500
Used to have a TV in here somewhere,
but I don't know where Granddad put it.

07:45.680 --> 07:46.900
[Ed] Oh what is that?

07:46.900 --> 07:47.440
[Chloe] Ah!

07:47.500 --> 07:50.520
[Ed] - That's a pretty cool box.
[Chloe] - Yeah my granddad made it. It's really old.

07:50.580 --> 07:52.160
[Ed] Your granddad made the box?

07:52.160 --> 07:52.780
Yeah he did.

07:52.780 --> 07:54.390
[Ed] I'm just impressed that Joe made that.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.240
[Chloe] Why are you not more impressed by this?

07:56.330 --> 07:57.720
[Ed] What? Did he make that as well?

07:57.960 --> 07:59.240
[Ed] Go on..

07:59.240 --> 08:01.240
[Projector whirrs]
 [Ed] Oh!

08:03.560 --> 08:08.560
[Chloe] That's Amelia with my mum.
They look really happy.

08:09.100 --> 08:11.060
[Chloe] That's my Granddad.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.440
[Ed] That's Joe?

08:16.880 --> 08:22.080
[Chloe] That's my Gran, Sophia. She died
a couple of years after Amelia disappeared.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.200
[Chloe] Half the family gone in just two years.

08:26.100 --> 08:30.220
[Ed] That's awful. Poor Joe.

08:31.710 --> 08:34.100
[Ed] Are you sure this party for him is a good idea?

08:34.100 --> 08:37.440
[Chloe] No, not really. But try telling that to my mum.

08:37.860 --> 08:41.760
[Low music]
[Party chatter]

08:45.380 --> 08:46.420
What are you doing?

08:46.420 --> 08:47.740
[Chloe] Birthday messages.

08:47.850 --> 08:49.420
You going round to everybody?

08:49.520 --> 08:54.980
Happy Birthday Dad! That's me done yeah?

08:55.520 --> 08:56.340
[Clicks fingers]

08:56.340 --> 08:58.100
[Ed] Two lovely ladies.

08:58.180 --> 08:59.220
[Giggles]

08:59.230 --> 09:02.680
[Chloe] I was just wondering if I could ask
you a couple of questions about Amelia.

09:02.680 --> 09:08.160
Oh that's a long time ago. Yes, I do remember
Amelia, yes she was really really sweet.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.160
Yes, I knew her, Yes.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.600
[Chloe] What was she like?

09:11.600 --> 09:14.520
She was a bit shy. Yes.

09:15.140 --> 09:17.500
[Ed] So Peter, tell me about your love of gnomes?

09:17.500 --> 09:21.840
My love of gnomes? They're glorious little chaps.
I've got a collection of them in the garden.

09:21.840 --> 09:26.260
One sits there all day with his little fishing pole.
I've never seen him catch anything though.

09:26.280 --> 09:29.160
Always very helpful with neighbours
and stuff like that.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.600
We just used to be party animals, y'know.

09:31.600 --> 09:36.020
There used to be lots of guys around her, cause
she really was quite a stunning looking girl.

09:36.020 --> 09:37.520
[Chloe] What did she look like?

09:37.700 --> 09:40.500
Little bit plumpish, freckles.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.500
Short, vivacious.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.500
I seem to remember she had
very beautiful blonde hair.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.460
Tall, long dark hair. Bit wavy.

09:48.460 --> 09:52.460
And I tried to be friends with her,
but she wouldn't have it.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.660
Maybe I've got that effect on people.

09:55.240 --> 09:58.640
[Chloe] I just wanted to ask you a
few questions about Amelia.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.640
Sure.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.880
[Chloe] Erm... what was she like?

10:02.880 --> 10:08.700
She was a bit strange because
she always had a mac on.

10:08.700 --> 10:13.220
And she had to hold the mac. She would be lovely
underneath, but she would never take her mac off.

10:13.500 --> 10:16.940
She had this kind of weird...
"french" persona about her.

10:16.940 --> 10:17.520
[Chloe] French?

10:17.520 --> 10:21.940
Yeah. I actually heard heard talking french on
the phone once. It was a pay phone where we were.

10:21.940 --> 10:25.680
I don't speak a word of french so actually
I couldn't tell you if it really was french?

10:26.380 --> 10:28.180
But she said it was french.

10:28.180 --> 10:29.620
What happened to her?

10:29.880 --> 10:32.700
[Chloe] She went missing from
the street thirty years ago.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.940
The street? Which street?

10:35.520 --> 10:39.920
And I think she went to America,
because I know somebody told me that.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.920
Has she been reported missing?

10:41.920 --> 10:43.920
[Chloe] Yes. Thirty years ago.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.880
Thirty years ago and they've
done nothing about it?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.780
[Chloe] Well, I think they tried to find her.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.880
[Chloe] Hello Dr Colby, how are you?

10:52.360 --> 10:56.260
[Chloe] Just wanted to ask you a couple
of questions about Amelia if that's okay?

10:56.260 --> 11:00.640
My father took me to one side one day
and said "You do know, she's a prostitute-"

11:00.660 --> 11:04.880
[Chloe] - Did you think she was a prostitute or
was that just something that your dad said?
- Well...

11:05.400 --> 11:09.020
[Dr Colby] I don't want you to be
doing things like this now, of all times.

11:09.260 --> 11:12.940
We're not here for you to try and
be the spotlight because you want-

11:12.950 --> 11:15.010
[Chloe] No! That wasn't that at all.

11:15.020 --> 11:17.180
Is this thing on? Switch it off now.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.380
[Chloe] - What you doing?
[Ed] - [Chuckles] Who's this?

11:20.560 --> 11:21.900
[Chloe] News of the world.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.260
[Ed] News of the who?

11:23.260 --> 11:24.580
[Chloe] Lorraine.

11:24.580 --> 11:26.900
[Chloe] No, no, no, no, Ed, don't.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.900
[Ed] Lorraine?

11:29.760 --> 11:30.810
Kimberley's sister?

11:33.060 --> 11:36.920
Jessica Holloway, told me. She lives at number 16.

11:36.920 --> 11:40.480
She told me she was wearing a red dress
the night she went missing.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.720
I heard she was odd.

11:41.720 --> 11:46.060
I get the feeling it's a story a lot of people
round here would rather not talk about much.

11:46.060 --> 11:48.300
Oh, here comes Mother Teresa.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.620
[Holda] Hi!

11:49.940 --> 11:51.020
[Ed] Who's that?

11:51.020 --> 11:52.600
[Chloe] That's our neighbour, Holda.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.280
Darling, how lovely to see you.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.500
Is that your boyfriend?

11:56.500 --> 11:58.500
[Chloe] Erm, no. Erm...

11:58.500 --> 11:59.940
He's very cute.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.280
Turn it off.

12:03.160 --> 12:07.120
She used to own all the land around here.
Before they built the estate.

12:08.220 --> 12:10.280
Had to sell it all to cover their debts.

12:10.500 --> 12:14.240
[Chloe] I want to ask a couple of questions
actually. About Amelia?

12:14.580 --> 12:17.740
She had a blazing row with Joe before his stroke.

12:18.140 --> 12:22.460
I'm not saying she brought it on. I'm just
saying I'm surprised she's here that's all.

12:22.460 --> 12:25.330
I thought this was about your
grandfather? It's his birthday.

12:25.340 --> 12:26.480
[Chloe] Yeah, yeah, it is.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.580
[Chloe] We're filming for him and
for school so it's both.

12:29.580 --> 12:32.860
Well, I don't know what I can tell you about Amelia.

12:32.860 --> 12:36.780
Her parents were very distressed by
what happened. They were heartbroken.

12:37.560 --> 12:41.000
You were there when Joe
got attacked. What happened?

12:41.200 --> 12:41.880
Erm.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.760
[Neighbour] Excuse me, need you in the kitchen.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.680
Okay.

12:45.680 --> 12:46.480
Party time!

12:47.180 --> 12:48.480
Party! Party!

12:49.420 --> 12:50.840
[Ed] Boyfriend eh?

12:51.860 --> 12:53.040
Shut up.

12:53.680 --> 12:54.680
It is off isn't it?

12:55.800 --> 12:56.680
[Thud]

12:56.680 --> 13:01.280
[Ed] She had sort of dark, reddish,
blonde-looking hair.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.960
but really fucking beautiful at the same time.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.340
[Ed] Do your Lorraine impression.

13:06.340 --> 13:10.280
"Well I thought, she was going down there..."
she was just -

13:10.280 --> 13:13.380
[Ed] Is that it? That was literally the
worst impression I've ever, ever heard.

13:13.380 --> 13:16.340
But I don't understand.
She asked you to turn he camera off,

13:16.340 --> 13:19.230
and I still had the mic in her face.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.670
You were flirting with her quite a bit actually.
[Ed] Are you jealous?

13:21.680 --> 13:23.020
[Laughs] No, of course not.

13:23.020 --> 13:24.560
[Ed] Are you jealous of Lorraine?

13:27.560 --> 13:29.570
What happened to gone and not forgotten?

13:29.630 --> 13:32.340
I wouldn't mind, but there's pictures
on the wall of her.

13:32.340 --> 13:34.340
[Ed] So what do you think then?

13:34.340 --> 13:37.340
I don't know. You're probably
better off asking Peter's gnomes.

13:37.340 --> 13:38.940
[Ed] [Chuckles]

13:42.400 --> 13:43.100
[Chloe] Sid!

13:43.100 --> 13:45.920
[Sid] You're making a film about Amelia?

13:45.920 --> 13:47.600
[Chloe] Yeah, did you know her?

13:47.600 --> 13:49.600
I've got some old press cutting at home.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.260
[Ed] Press cuttings?

13:51.260 --> 13:53.260
Yeah, from the time.

13:53.260 --> 13:55.480
Well, she was a bit troubled - d'you know what I mean?

13:55.480 --> 13:56.860
[Chloe] What do you mean troubled?

13:56.860 --> 13:59.620
Just to take off like that, just to run away?

13:59.620 --> 14:02.200
No phone calls? No letters?

14:02.200 --> 14:04.340
Someone in there said she was a prostitute?

14:04.340 --> 14:06.920
She had a few problems.
[Chloe] - What do you mean by a few problems?

14:06.960 --> 14:09.920
[Sid] She didn't fit in very well at home.
She was a bit of a loner.

14:09.920 --> 14:14.320
Everyone keeps saying that she was unhappy,
but we've seen all these videos
where she seems really happy.

14:14.360 --> 14:18.880
You're only a friend of my granddad's,
I don't understand how you could know
she was really miserable and upset?

14:18.880 --> 14:20.880
Do you think she was murdered?

14:20.880 --> 14:22.880
[Sighs]

14:22.990 --> 14:25.360
I don't really think it's the best
time to talk about that.

14:25.500 --> 14:28.080
[Everyone Singing] And so say all of us!

14:30.850 --> 14:35.380
Just want to say a massive thank you
for to you all for coming here today.

14:35.580 --> 14:40.130
As you know, when dad fell ill,
my daughter Chloe was there.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.380
And I just want to tell her

14:45.230 --> 14:47.030
[Kimberley] in front of all of you

14:47.630 --> 14:49.130
[Kimberley] how much I love her

14:49.530 --> 14:51.580
and how thankful I am.

14:53.580 --> 14:57.030
[Kimberley] Thank you, my darling girl. Thank you.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.230
[Kimberley] [Sighs] To Joe!

15:00.230 --> 15:01.980
[Everybody] To Joe!

15:04.830 --> 15:06.030
[Guest] Cheers, Joe.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.980
[Guest] Great speech though.

15:07.980 --> 15:09.980
[Ed] Chloe?

15:13.930 --> 15:15.230
What's up?

15:15.330 --> 15:16.280
[Chloe] You alright?

15:16.280 --> 15:17.980
Yeah, not too bad.

15:17.980 --> 15:20.280
What you doing out here?

15:20.280 --> 15:22.280
[Chloe] Just, looking at stuff.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.800
Just filming my face again.

15:23.840 --> 15:24.520
[Chloe] Yeah.

15:24.530 --> 15:28.070
You know you don't have to film everything
just because you don't want to talk about stuff.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.280
[Chloe] I'm fine.

15:29.580 --> 15:32.580
[Chloe] Obviously I want you here.
I just don't want to talk about it okay?

15:34.580 --> 15:36.930
[Chloe] Let's do something.
Let's go do some filming.

15:36.930 --> 15:39.330
[Ed] Yep, yep, sure.
Let's go do some shit.

15:52.030 --> 15:53.830
How do I look?

15:54.880 --> 15:56.280
[Ed] Like a ghost.

16:02.180 --> 16:04.730
[Footsteps]

16:04.730 --> 16:06.730
[Gate creaks open]

16:08.580 --> 16:10.230
[Ed] - Cut!
[Chloe] - How does it look?

16:10.230 --> 16:12.080
[Ed] Can you like... try and look less cold?

16:12.080 --> 16:13.330
[Chuckles, shivers]

16:13.330 --> 16:14.380
[Ed] Right. Shall we go again?

16:14.380 --> 16:15.630
[Gate creaks open]

16:15.630 --> 16:17.430
[Footsteps]

16:17.430 --> 16:19.930
[Ed] Erm... come down the gate here instead.

16:19.930 --> 16:20.680
[Chloe] This one?

16:20.680 --> 16:21.930
[Ed] Yeah, yeah yeah.

16:23.930 --> 16:26.630
[Footsteps on gravel]

16:29.930 --> 16:31.030
[Distant smash]

16:31.030 --> 16:32.030
[Screaming]

16:32.030 --> 16:33.680
[Ed] What the fuck?

16:33.880 --> 16:35.880
[Ed] Hold on, Chloe,
come back, I didn't get that.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.980
[Footsteps - running]

16:40.090 --> 16:41.920
[Summer] - [Scream]
[Ed] - [Coughs - winded]
[Chloe] - Ed!

16:41.980 --> 16:44.580
[Summer] [Screaming manically]

16:44.600 --> 16:46.410
[Simon] - It's alright.
[Summer] - Please let me go!

16:46.440 --> 16:47.480
[Simon] - I got you.
[Summer] - No!

16:47.530 --> 16:49.030
[Summer] No! No!

16:49.030 --> 16:50.630
[Summer] Help!

16:50.630 --> 16:51.750
[Chloe] Are you okay?

16:51.750 --> 16:54.880
[Ed] - Yeah yeah!
[Summer] - Please! Help! Help!

16:54.880 --> 16:56.620
[Simon] - Thank God!
[Summer] - Help me please!

16:56.650 --> 16:58.930
[Simon] Go get Dr Colby!

16:59.280 --> 17:01.680
[Simon] - Now! Quickly!
[Ed] - Go! Go! Go!

17:02.960 --> 17:04.619
[Summer] Let me go!

17:04.650 --> 17:05.589
[Summer] Please!

17:07.900 --> 17:09.880
[Dr Colby] - Let me see Summer.
[Summer] - Help!

17:09.920 --> 17:12.020
[Summer] - No!
[Simon] - I think she's taken something.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.680
[Simon] We thought we'd looked everywhere.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.730
[Summer] Help me!

17:17.020 --> 17:20.300
[Simon] She bit me and she attacked him too.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.390
[Dr Colby] Stay back!

17:22.530 --> 17:24.550
[Simon] Can you turn that off it's not helping.

17:24.569 --> 17:26.819
[Dr Colby] No keep the light on, it helps.

17:26.849 --> 17:28.650
[Dr Colby] Summer? Summer, listen.

17:28.660 --> 17:29.490
[Chloe] Just calm down.

17:29.490 --> 17:29.980
[Ed] Stay back.

17:29.990 --> 17:31.100
[Dr Colby] Stay still.

17:31.100 --> 17:34.220
[Dr Colby] - I'm going to give you a shot.
[Summer] - No no no no no no.

17:35.670 --> 17:36.810
[Chloe] I'll call an ambulance.

17:36.810 --> 17:39.220
[Dr Colby] No no. No need to call one,
I can deal with this inside.

17:39.230 --> 17:41.110
[Dr Colby] Take her under the arms,
 we'll deal with it inside.

17:41.110 --> 17:41.820
[Dr Colby] That's it!

17:42.260 --> 17:44.360
[Dr Colby] [Groan]

17:44.360 --> 17:45.080
Are you okay?

17:45.760 --> 17:47.260
[Ed] Yeah, yeah I'm fine.

17:48.150 --> 17:51.260
[Dr Colby] You'll be fine, you'll be fine.
That's okay. You're okay.

17:51.560 --> 17:52.790
What the fuck?

18:01.090 --> 18:02.950
[Ed] Is it really necessary to film this?

18:02.960 --> 18:03.700
[Chloe] Let me see.

18:03.840 --> 18:04.730
[Ed] It's fine.

18:05.370 --> 18:07.440
[Chloe] - It looks really sore.
[Ed] - [Winces]

18:07.930 --> 18:09.730
[Chloe] - Are you sure you're ok?
[Ed] - Hmm-mm.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.640
[Chloe] Did you get it all on film?

18:13.600 --> 18:14.610
[Camera beeps "ON"]

18:17.520 --> 18:19.750
[Chloe on screen] I would, but it's fucking freezing!

18:20.240 --> 18:22.740
[Ed on screen] Hold on, Chloe,
come back I didn't get that.

18:24.790 --> 18:27.670
[Summer on screen] - [Screaming]

18:29.340 --> 18:30.700
[Ed] She look's fucking crazy.

18:30.730 --> 18:32.440
[Summer on screen] No! Let me go!

18:32.460 --> 18:34.730
[Ed] Can you see how she came
out of nowhere just like - BAM!

18:35.100 --> 18:37.740
[Summer on screen] No!

18:37.780 --> 18:39.540
[Chloe] Hi, could I speak to the police please?

18:40.680 --> 18:42.550
[Chloe] Amazing! When did you get this?

18:42.550 --> 18:44.070
[Ed] Last week. What are you doing?

18:47.690 --> 18:49.420
[Ed] No, come on, Chloe, put the camera away.

18:49.430 --> 18:50.530
[Chloe] Wait a minute.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.360
[Ed] - No, seriously what -
[Chloe] - They can't even see us anyway. Shh!

18:53.830 --> 18:56.100
[Ed] You're filming someone's
personal shit right now.

19:03.450 --> 19:04.870
[Ed] Right, are you happy now?

19:05.240 --> 19:06.100
[Chloe] That's it?

19:06.320 --> 19:10.020
[Summer on screen] - [Screaming]

19:12.920 --> 19:14.330
[Chloe] She runs out...

19:15.120 --> 19:16.880
[Chloe] like she's running for her life.

19:17.010 --> 19:20.230
[Chloe] Why would they need a grown
man to pin her down to the floor?

19:20.230 --> 19:21.510
[Ed] That's it - now go back, go back.

19:22.220 --> 19:24.640
[Ed] She's screaming help to
you because she knows -
[Chloe] - Yes!

19:24.680 --> 19:27.610
[Ed] if you go near her, she can start
attacking you. That's why.

19:27.670 --> 19:29.570
[Chloe] She looks absolutely petrified.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.990
[Chloe] She doesn't look like she's on drugs.

19:32.450 --> 19:33.610
"She got out"

19:33.650 --> 19:35.170
[Chloe] You heard "She got out"

19:35.190 --> 19:35.960
Yeah?

19:36.340 --> 19:37.970
[Chloe] Like "she escaped!"

19:38.060 --> 19:39.610
No, that's not what I said.

19:40.020 --> 19:41.800
[Chloe] It would be hard wouldn't it?

19:41.840 --> 19:44.170
[Chloe] Keeping someone prisoner against their will?

19:46.410 --> 19:48.240
[Chloe] What if she wasn't on drugs?

19:48.420 --> 19:49.640
[Chloe] Just listen, okay?

19:49.650 --> 19:51.480
[Chloe] - What if she was hysterical,
[Ed] - [Sighs]

19:51.520 --> 19:53.450
[Chloe] and then, they're over here...

19:53.720 --> 19:55.650
[Chloe] the life and soul of the party,

19:55.680 --> 19:57.670
[Chloe] and yet she's next door on her own.

19:57.740 --> 20:00.930
[Chloe] Would you leave someone in that
frame of mind, on their own, next door?

20:00.960 --> 20:02.160
[Chloe] This is weird!

20:02.200 --> 20:06.420
[Ed] What do you mean, "this is weird!"? This is weird - is this your new thing now?
[Chloe] - Oh no no no, I'm documenting this.

20:06.430 --> 20:10.030
What you documenting it for?
What the fuck is that gonna do?
[Chloe] - We need to see what the fuck is going on.

20:10.040 --> 20:13.240
What do you mean "see what's going on?"
You can see what's going on. She's off her tits!

20:13.240 --> 20:15.290
Why are you doing all this?
Why can't you just leave it?

20:15.290 --> 20:17.820
[Chloe] Because this - what we just
experienced is fucking weird.

20:17.910 --> 20:20.890
Right. Chloe, what do you want us to do?

20:20.890 --> 20:23.890
We've called the police. We've done
everything we fucking can.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.650
[Chloe] I don't think we've done enough.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.250
[Chloe] - Morning
[Ed] - Morning

20:32.300 --> 20:34.410
[Ed] Yeah, no, it came from...
I don't know...around this area?

20:34.450 --> 20:35.830
[Chloe] And what did it sound like?

20:35.840 --> 20:38.450
[Ed] Dunno - like, a low rumble?

20:38.860 --> 20:41.860
[Ed] Yeah. But do all the houses
around here have basements?

20:41.860 --> 20:43.480
[Chloe] I've got no idea.

20:43.570 --> 20:44.460
[Ed] Okay.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.290
[Ed] Can I stay in your room tonight?

20:48.290 --> 20:50.290
[Doorbell]

20:50.440 --> 20:52.710
[Hurried footsteps]

20:54.860 --> 20:56.300
[Kimberley] [Sighs]

20:56.660 --> 20:59.260
[Kimberley] Have either of you
two seen Lorraine's lipstick?

20:59.450 --> 21:02.000
She's called twice already today.
[Doorbell]

21:03.760 --> 21:06.810
[Kimberley] It's fine. I'll get it.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.600
[Ed] What did she want?

21:11.640 --> 21:12.770
[Chloe] Keep filming.

21:12.900 --> 21:15.360
[Ed] - Why would I keep filming?
[Chloe] - Keep filming.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.780
[Front door opens]

21:16.820 --> 21:17.860
[Kimberley] Holda!

21:17.890 --> 21:20.960
[Holda] Darling! How lovely to see you!

21:20.970 --> 21:24.880
[Holda] This is for you.
To thank you for all your help.

21:24.890 --> 21:26.120
[Kimberley] Oh wow!

21:26.170 --> 21:27.440
[Holda] Thank you so much!

21:27.880 --> 21:29.670
[Holda] - Chloe!
[Kimberley] - Is that apple?

21:29.700 --> 21:31.140
[Holda] Come here my darling.

21:31.140 --> 21:33.610
[Holda] Thank you so much, darling Chloe!

21:33.610 --> 21:35.610
[Kimberley] What's going on?

21:40.760 --> 21:42.760
[Holda] This is so difficult.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.870
[Dr Colby] Would you like me explain, Holda?

21:47.600 --> 21:48.980
[Holda] It's my niece, Summer...

21:49.660 --> 21:52.540
[Holda] she's - she's a drug addict.

21:53.650 --> 21:55.250
[Kimberley] Oh Holda!

21:55.280 --> 21:57.420
[Holda] We tried to keep it from everyone

21:58.370 --> 22:01.210
[Dr Colby] We've had to keep
Summer locked in the house.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.340
She's been in withdrawal for a few days now.

22:04.470 --> 22:08.490
But last night she took something and well,
it led to a skirmish in the street.

22:08.630 --> 22:09.810
[Kimberley] A skirmish?

22:09.930 --> 22:11.100
A skirmish?

22:13.440 --> 22:16.740
[Holda] But these two... they saved her.

22:19.360 --> 22:21.480
We didn't really do anything.

22:22.500 --> 22:26.840
[Holda] Simon says you stopped her from
running out into the street further away and...

22:27.490 --> 22:29.080
yes you did!

22:29.090 --> 22:30.870
[Dr Colby] I take it it was you who called the police?

22:30.980 --> 22:32.790
[Chloe] Yes, of course, we were worried.

22:32.850 --> 22:35.930
We've got Summer locked inside the house.

22:35.930 --> 22:38.150
She's given her legal consent for it.

22:38.200 --> 22:42.310
We've had to gain that from the Police
otherwise she wouldn't be able to do so.

22:42.620 --> 22:43.810
[Chloe] You can do that?

22:43.880 --> 22:44.850
[Dr Colby] Yep.

22:44.930 --> 22:47.580
[Holda] She's been in rehab three times already.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.110
[Dr Colby] Sorry to bring this up...

22:49.190 --> 22:51.250
especially as Holda has been so grateful,

22:51.290 --> 22:54.000
I couldn't help noticing your camera.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.600
You were filming?

22:55.600 --> 22:57.380
[Kimberley] You were filming?

22:57.420 --> 22:59.400
[Ed] Yeah, woah! We were filming,
but nothing to do with this.

22:59.410 --> 23:01.200
[Chloe] - We were filming the final project.
[Kimberley] - Really?
[Chloe] - Yeah.

23:01.210 --> 23:01.900
[Dr Colby] A final project?

23:01.930 --> 23:03.620
[Chloe] We didn't capture anything if that's -

23:03.630 --> 23:05.290
[Dr Colby] You sure you didn't capture anything...

23:05.300 --> 23:07.330
because there's a lot of stuff...

23:07.360 --> 23:10.080
just gets filmed and put up on the
internet these days and I'd rather...

23:10.970 --> 23:12.050
I'd just rather it be deleted.

23:12.070 --> 23:15.100
[Ed] Yeah no, we were filming but when the camera
dropped to the ground it stopped recording.

23:15.110 --> 23:19.510
[Dr Colby] Ok, so it's just it's better to have
these things wiped out entirely should t
hey exist than for them to be there at all.

23:19.520 --> 23:20.940
[Holda] I'm sure that's fine.

23:21.770 --> 23:24.850
[Kimberley] Thank you for coming and
explaining it all and just -

23:24.860 --> 23:26.320
[Holda] Well thank you for these two.

23:26.340 --> 23:28.520
[Holda] I don't know what we
would have done without them.

23:28.810 --> 23:31.370
[Kimberley] Oh give us a hug. Bless you.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.620
[Chloe] Ed, wake up!

23:45.350 --> 23:47.290
[Chloe] Ed!

23:47.380 --> 23:49.680
[Ed] Chloe, what the fuck do you want man?

23:49.740 --> 23:51.400
[Chloe] She's outside again.

23:56.700 --> 24:01.020
[Howling wind]

24:01.170 --> 24:02.100
[Chloe] She's just there. Summer?

24:03.120 --> 24:03.830
[Chloe] Summer?

24:26.740 --> 24:27.700
[Ed] Chloe, be careful.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.000
[Chloe] I just want to talk to her.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.780
[Chloe] Summer?

24:51.520 --> 24:54.060
[Chloe] Lorraine?

25:06.260 --> 25:09.480
[Kimberley] Have you had a fight with Ed?

25:10.560 --> 25:15.900
[Chloe] No, he's just gone into
town to get some stuff together.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.140
Have you kissed him yet?

25:17.140 --> 25:21.120
[Chloe] Mum! Yes, I have. I have kissed him.

25:22.420 --> 25:26.040
[Chloe] But I've not really spoken to him about it.

25:26.460 --> 25:28.060
[Chloe] We've not really spoken about it.

25:28.180 --> 25:32.340
[Chloe] I've spoken to him actually since...
or until this week.

25:32.420 --> 25:33.580
Oh, Chloe.

25:33.580 --> 25:35.580
[Chloe] I know, I was just...

25:35.900 --> 25:37.880
[Chloe] It's not really been my priority.

25:38.360 --> 25:43.230
[Chloe] You know, being here,
Granddad, that's my priority.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.900
[Joe] - [Groans]

25:44.910 --> 25:46.380
[Chloe] Mum?
[Kimberley] Hmm?

25:46.380 --> 25:49.300
[Chloe] Can I talk to you about Ameilia?

25:49.310 --> 25:51.150
[Kimberley] What do you want to know?

25:51.680 --> 25:56.760
[Chloe] Er, wow! That was -
that was a lot easier than I expected.

25:57.420 --> 26:02.720
[Kimberley] Well, I dragged you away
from the city, put you in her room...

26:02.720 --> 26:03.900
So ask me?

26:03.900 --> 26:05.290
[Chloe] I don't see it like that.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.060
Well that's where we are.

26:09.720 --> 26:11.360
[Chloe] How do you remember her?

26:15.600 --> 26:18.980
[Kimberley] She was a good sister.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.580
[Kimberley] She smiled and laughed a lot.

26:24.940 --> 26:27.860
[Kimberley] Oh we'd fight sometimes
as sisters do and ...

26:27.860 --> 26:29.860
she'd boss me around,

26:31.500 --> 26:33.300
but she always stood up for me.

26:35.100 --> 26:39.660
[Kimberley] She punched a boy in the face once.
He was calling me names.

26:39.660 --> 26:44.300
[Kimberley] She didn't even threaten him
she just walked straight up to him and
smacked him in the nose.

26:44.300 --> 26:44.780
[Chloe] Wow

26:44.780 --> 26:47.200
[Kimberley] Yeah she was like that. A do'er.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.840
[Chloe] What's this picture?

26:56.380 --> 27:01.420
[Kimberley] When she was sixteen,
Amelia got ill.

27:04.180 --> 27:05.860
The doctors said it was a tumor.

27:06.380 --> 27:07.240
[Chloe] A tumor?

27:11.800 --> 27:13.560
[Chloe] That's your necklace right?

27:18.160 --> 27:20.200
[Kimberley] When the doctors diagnosed her...

27:20.240 --> 27:23.780
they said she had months to live.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.200
She gave me this.

27:30.960 --> 27:35.620
But then one day, she didn't look as pale anymore.

27:36.960 --> 27:39.280
And the doctors said it was a miracle.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.840
The tumour had just shrivelled up and vanished.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.030
[Kimberley] She was different after.

27:46.240 --> 27:47.360
[Chloe] Different how?

27:48.200 --> 27:51.020
[Kimberley] More insular.

27:51.940 --> 27:54.180
[Kimberley] She told Dad she was moving away.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.540
[Chloe] So that's what you believe happened?

27:59.280 --> 28:00.320
Yes and no.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.600
Towards the end she was kind of erratic.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.360
I know it's not logical.

28:14.180 --> 28:16.700
And I know something else
probably came of her but -

28:18.960 --> 28:20.700
I can't think of her like that.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.120
I see her...

28:28.080 --> 28:31.180
marching up the street the way she marched

28:31.480 --> 28:34.360
across the playground ready to hit that boy.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.220
She just did it.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.660
Oh, I know it's stupid.

28:42.660 --> 28:43.720
[Chloe] It's not stupid.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.780
[Kimberley] - [Sobs]

28:48.840 --> 28:49.940
[Kimberley] Anyway.

28:52.030 --> 28:55.020
[Kimberley] That's what you should do with that boy.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.140
March right up to him and tell him how you feel.

29:00.020 --> 29:03.260
Or even better, march right up to him and kiss him.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.020
Or whatever you want to do.

29:05.070 --> 29:09.520
[Chloe] - Mum! [Chuckles]
 - I don't need the details unless you want to tell me.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.740
It's good that he's here.

29:14.900 --> 29:15.840
How are you really?

29:15.840 --> 29:16.740
[Chloe] I'm good.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.300
Hmm.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.100
[T.V. - inaudible]

29:31.420 --> 29:32.860
[Chloe] Ed.

29:33.600 --> 29:34.340
[Chloe] Ed!

29:34.440 --> 29:35.220
[Ed] Yeah?

29:35.220 --> 29:37.220
[Chloe] Come and have a look at this.

29:39.400 --> 29:40.360
[Ed] What's up?

29:40.360 --> 29:44.170
[Chloe] Well if you had a junkie in your house,
would you invite guests over?

29:59.920 --> 30:02.940
[Faint piano music and gospel singing]

30:29.640 --> 30:31.680
[Gate unlatches]

30:32.260 --> 30:35.920
[Footsteps over shingles]
[Gospel sings "All Things Bright and Beautiful']

30:39.000 --> 30:40.960
[Ed] What the fuck is that?

30:40.960 --> 30:42.960
[Chloe] What can you hear?

30:51.320 --> 30:53.080
[Chloe on screen] What can you hear?

30:56.280 --> 30:59.560
[Muffled singing]

31:02.400 --> 31:08.480
[Muffled chanting]

31:34.500 --> 31:37.040
[Ed] No, I'm sorry. This is bollocks.

31:37.040 --> 31:41.580
[Ed] Oh come on. Really? Witchcraft?
Honestly, brilliant journalism.

31:41.590 --> 31:43.710
[Chloe] It's not ridiculous if they believe in it.

31:43.720 --> 31:47.780
[Chloe] You saw it for yourself.
That crippled guy walks into the house...

31:47.980 --> 31:51.380
[Chloe] What? An hour later comes out
and he's completely fine walking freely?

31:51.560 --> 31:53.580
[Chloe] It's just like what happened to Amelia.

31:53.820 --> 31:56.820
[Chloe] Parties, social occasions,
anything she might pop up in.

31:56.820 --> 31:58.820
[Projector whirs]

32:04.900 --> 32:07.700
[Ed] Wait! Aren't these the same people
from the party the other day?

32:09.340 --> 32:11.520
[Ed] Christ, don't they ever fucking age?

32:11.520 --> 32:12.640
[Projector clicks off]

32:25.880 --> 32:27.420
[Chloe] What's this one?

32:36.480 --> 32:38.640
[Ed] Wait what is that?

32:49.600 --> 32:51.960
[Chloe] I saw that symbol in her book.

33:00.490 --> 33:01.790
[Ed] - Wait, what?
[Chloe] - [Gasps]

33:01.920 --> 33:02.910
[Projector clicks off]

33:17.880 --> 33:19.620
[Chloe] What is it?

33:21.460 --> 33:23.120
[Ed] Fuck me.

33:26.100 --> 33:28.500
[Ed] Look, it's her. She's right there.

33:31.180 --> 33:32.200
[Chloe] I don't know.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.200
[Ed] It's fucking her.

33:35.300 --> 33:36.640
[Ed] Look at it!

33:37.840 --> 33:39.680
[Chloe] How is that possible?

33:40.510 --> 33:43.860
[Chloe] - Why? I want you to tell me why you don't
want to be part of this documentary anymore?
[Ed] - What do you mean 'why'?

33:43.900 --> 33:45.420
Because I've got no fucking idea what is going on.

33:45.420 --> 33:49.260
This shit is creepy! All this stuff, everything that's
been happening - can you explain any of it?

33:49.260 --> 33:50.760
[Chloe] No I can't. Not yet anyway.

33:50.760 --> 33:53.510
Why can't we just give this shit to the police,
just get it over and done with.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.140
[Chloe] Oh you're just fucking chicken aren't you?

33:55.140 --> 33:56.060
I'm a fucking chicken?

33:56.060 --> 33:57.720
[Chloe] Yeah you are.
You're just scared aren't you?

33:57.720 --> 34:00.240
This is why, I'm so done with your bullshit.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.360
[Chloe] What the fuck are you doing?

34:01.360 --> 34:02.540
I'm fucking done is what I'm doing.

34:02.540 --> 34:03.720
[Chloe] Are you fucking joking me?

34:03.720 --> 34:05.720
No, I'm calling the police.

34:05.720 --> 34:06.760
[Chloe] No you're not!

34:06.760 --> 34:10.260
[Ed] What the fuck are you doing?
Get off! Stop! Fucking stop!

34:28.780 --> 34:30.300
Hello?

34:30.300 --> 34:31.520
[Chloe] [Laughing] Hey

34:31.520 --> 34:34.300
Is this what you always do after sex?
You film the other person?

34:34.300 --> 34:35.179
[Chloe] Shut up!

34:35.300 --> 34:36.280
[Chloe] How are you?

34:36.280 --> 34:37.800
Yeah, I'm not too bad.

34:38.860 --> 34:40.620
7 out of 10 I guess.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.520
[Chloe] 6.5 if you're lucky.

34:42.520 --> 34:44.900
What? Why 6.5?

34:45.460 --> 34:46.820
[Chloe] .5 because I'm bring generous.

34:46.820 --> 34:51.920
Ed] - What? So you're giving me a 6? Why? Is it because
I like... finished in 30 seconds and started crying?
[Chloe] - [Laughing] Yeah that would be right.

34:58.200 --> 35:01.200
[Chloe] I'm really sorry that I
didn't speak to you for three months.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.200
That's okay.

35:03.780 --> 35:04.960
[Chloe] I am really sorry though.

35:04.960 --> 35:09.420
That's fine, Iook at how much fucked up shit you've
been through. I just didn't understand, that's all.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.880
What happened between you and those three boys?

35:14.940 --> 35:16.960
[Car engine starts]

35:26.300 --> 35:27.280
[Chloe] Oh there she is.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.040
[Chloe] Get your keys.

35:39.080 --> 35:39.780
[Gate squeaks]

35:40.060 --> 35:42.000
[Running footsteps]

35:43.640 --> 35:45.920
[Car door opens/slams shut]

35:47.420 --> 35:48.420
[Chloe] Hurry up, come on.

35:48.420 --> 35:49.400
[Ed] Yeah, alright, okay.

35:52.020 --> 35:54.120
Ok, so go left down here.

35:55.800 --> 35:56.460
[Chloe] Left!

35:56.460 --> 35:57.620
[Ed] Yeah, right.

36:18.660 --> 36:20.720
Just don't lose them.

36:25.820 --> 36:29.480
[Chloe] They've got to be around here somewhere.
They've got to be. They couldn't just disappear.

36:34.110 --> 36:37.470
Alright, that's it. We're going to turn around at the next turn because this is just pointless.

36:37.480 --> 36:38.280
No!

36:38.280 --> 36:40.460
[Chloe] - No, no, no. Don't do that.
[Ed] - What do you mean 'No'?

36:41.420 --> 36:44.060
Don't know why you're being such a pussy about it.

36:45.060 --> 36:46.800
What did you just say to me?

36:46.940 --> 36:48.360
I said why are you being such a pussy.

36:48.360 --> 36:50.580
[Ed] - A pussy? A pussy?
[Chloe] - Please Ed, just please! Carry on!

36:50.660 --> 36:52.260
[Ed] - Really? A fucking pussy?
[Chloe] - We're gonna lose them.

36:52.260 --> 36:56.000
[Ed] - Oh, I'm not a pussy when I do all this for you,
but now I'm a pussy because I wanna go back.
[Chloe] - Ed, Ed, Ed, Ed, please!

36:56.080 --> 36:57.880
[Ed] - Ed what? "Ed" what?
[Chloe] - Come on!

36:57.920 --> 37:00.860
[Ed] We're in the middle of fucking nowhere,
in the middle of the fucking night.

37:00.860 --> 37:02.260
You've no idea what you're doing!

37:02.260 --> 37:03.860
You absolutely joking me?

37:03.860 --> 37:07.540
[Chloe] Look please just keep going, please!
I'm begging you, just keep going.

37:14.920 --> 37:17.000
There must be a left or right or something.

37:17.860 --> 37:18.600
[Chloe] Is that them?

37:18.600 --> 37:19.700
[Ed] I don't know. Have a look. Is it red?

37:19.700 --> 37:20.860
[Chloe] No, I don't know.

37:20.860 --> 37:22.860
[Ed] Check.

37:23.300 --> 37:24.240
[Ed] No it's not them.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.240
Where would they have gone?

37:26.240 --> 37:28.240
I don't know. Nania.

37:28.750 --> 37:30.820
[Chloe] - Have you seen any turnings at all?
[Ed] - No.

37:30.820 --> 37:32.820
Anything? Like whatsoever?

37:37.620 --> 37:38.720
Are we done?

55:54.150 --> 55:56.680
[Sid] is three times higher than
the national average?

55:58.280 --> 56:00.064
[Chloe] Do you think they're connected?

56:00.330 --> 56:02.100
I think these are.

56:04.480 --> 56:08.100
[Summer on screen] - [Screaming]

56:16.280 --> 56:21.200
I was married when I first knew your grandfather,
when I first started working with him in fact.

56:21.950 --> 56:25.680
And we used to go out together, the four of us.

56:25.700 --> 56:30.050
Hadn't been married that long, and my wife was

56:30.880 --> 56:33.230
very keen to try for a baby.

56:33.780 --> 56:36.700
But we hadn't been having much luck.

56:37.930 --> 56:41.700
[Sid] So your grandmother, she's says to my wife,

56:41.700 --> 56:43.830
[Sid] "I know somebody who can help."

56:44.800 --> 56:48.330
[Sid] Now this person, she's a kind of healer,

56:48.750 --> 56:52.150
she makes remedies from plants and things.

56:52.150 --> 56:53.650
[Chloe] And this was Holda?

56:53.700 --> 56:54.680
[Sid] Yeah.

56:56.450 --> 57:00.730
[Sid] You're grandmother and Joe
had gone to this woman

57:00.730 --> 57:02.730
when they were trying for Amelia.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.430
And

57:04.430 --> 57:09.400
apprently she'd given your grandmother
like a "special drink"

57:10.550 --> 57:13.180
[Sid] and within a week, she was pregnant.

57:15.330 --> 57:19.300
So, my wife thinks "Yeah, that's great.
Can we try that?"

57:19.300 --> 57:21.950
And I didn't see any reason not to.

57:23.100 --> 57:27.680
But you know, it was really strange
because Joe - he came up to me

57:27.680 --> 57:30.030
and said "Don't do it."

57:30.680 --> 57:34.430
Straight out. He said to me
"Don't do it. She's a charlatan"

57:34.430 --> 57:36.750
He said "We've paid a high price for this."

57:36.760 --> 57:38.750
[Sid] - Well, of course -
[Chloe] - Wait! "A high price for it?"

57:38.780 --> 57:40.280
Were those his exact words?

57:41.900 --> 57:44.768
[Chloe] - [Panicked breathing]

57:44.816 --> 57:46.650
[Chloe] - [Gagging]
[Chloe] - [Hurried footsteps]

57:46.830 --> 57:49.350
[Chloe] - [Vomiting]

57:49.350 --> 57:51.350
[Chloe] - [Coughing]

57:55.700 --> 57:57.430
[Chloe] - [Gagging]

57:57.430 --> 57:59.430
[Chloe] - [Vomiting]

57:59.430 --> 58:01.430
[Chloe] - [Spitting]

58:01.430 --> 58:03.430
[Chloe] - [Gasping]

58:09.930 --> 58:11.780
[Chloe] What the fuck?

58:15.300 --> 58:17.100
[Chloe] What the f-

58:18.080 --> 58:19.950
[Vomiting]

58:20.550 --> 58:21.600
[Choking]

58:21.600 --> 58:23.600
[Chloe] Ed!

58:24.500 --> 58:25.730
[Chloe] Ed!

58:27.780 --> 58:28.730
[Ed] What?

58:28.730 --> 58:32.450
[Chloe] Hold this. Hold the camera.
Don't stop filming. Don't stop.

58:34.830 --> 58:37.450
[Kimberley] Chloe! Oh my God!

58:38.430 --> 58:41.100
[Kimberley] Ed, quick! Go get Dr Colby.

58:43.900 --> 58:47.650
[Dr Colby] Internally, there shouldn't
be any lasting damage.

58:47.650 --> 58:51.550
[Dr Colby] She will however suffer some
scarring from the cigarette burns.

58:52.250 --> 58:55.950
[Dr Colby] Psychologically, I think it
best we seek professional help.

58:58.330 --> 59:01.230
[Kimberley] She hasn't been the
same since the assault on Dad.

59:01.600 --> 59:05.750
[Kimberley] She keeps talking about
Amelia. What if it's hereditary?

59:05.750 --> 59:09.280
[Dr Colby] Schizophrenia can be
passed through the genes, yes.

59:09.424 --> 59:11.280
[Dr Colby] Then again it could just be trauma.

59:12.800 --> 59:14.780
[Dr Colby] You say she won't talk about it?

59:14.780 --> 59:17.350
[Kimberley] No. But that could
trigger it, couldn't it?

59:17.350 --> 59:21.230
[Kimberley] They said that the trauma was enough
for Amelia - that's what triggered it in her.

59:21.230 --> 59:23.230
[Dr Colby] It could just be a cry for help.

59:23.980 --> 59:27.980
[Dr Colby] I could put you in touch with
a friend who's the best in his field.

59:27.980 --> 59:32.850
[Dr Colby] Keep her off her feet for
a while. Absolutely no filming.

59:39.530 --> 59:40.900
[Chloe] - [Groans]

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.130
[Ed] Boo!

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.950
Why are you late? Seriously?

01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:15.700
[Chloe] You fucker! Why'd you do that?

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.700
[Ed] Do you like the shitty location?

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.700
[Chloe] Yes, so romantic.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.530
[Chloe] What is the big plan for today?

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:22.680
Oh right yeah erm...

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.730
All I'll say is... prepare yourself.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.830
I can't believe you brought me here.

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:34.250
[Ed] Open your eyes.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:39.630
[Ed] Ah yeah! Ah! Speechless!
Speechless, aren't you?

01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:43.180
Well you have stepped up from
the arcade. So I'll give you that.

01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:46.630
[Ed] Ah yeah! It's the hands!

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:53.450
[Ed] So I have this theory right?
That the only time you smoke...

01:00:53.952 --> 01:00:57.250
[Ed] is when you're with me. Cause you wanna
try and look like, mega mega cool?

01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:59.320
[Ed] - It was good wasn't it?
[Chloe] - It was alright, yeah.

01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:02.770
Yeah, and the only reason you didn't like
the arcade was because I beat you.

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:05.380
[Chloe] No, no it wasn't that.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.750
What was it then?

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:07.600
[Chloe] It's because it was shit.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.350
[Chloe] - Eh!
[Ed] - Eh!

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:16.250
[Ed] Oh I'm sorry Mrs Webber,
you're daughter is an alcoholic.

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:21.100
It's so cold! Thanks for bringing me out here.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:21.680
[Ed] Man up!

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.180
It's great. Man up? I can't see!

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:28.730
I just want to know I did good.

01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:30.400
[Chloe] That you did good?

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.050
[Chloe] You took me to an arcade!

01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:34.050
Oh come on! Stop going on about that!

01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:35.100
Keep smiling.

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.380
You're filming this aren't you?

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.330
No!

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.330
Thanks for today.

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:56.600
[Chloe] What is you're fondest
childhood experience?

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.400
Hearing the air raid sirens.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:07.750
The searchlights going up to
look for the German bombers

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:12.330
and then the searchlight lit up a barage balloon

01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:15.600
and I thought this was the most amazing thing.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.000
[Chloe] Granddad, come here! Look!

01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:21.200
[Chloe] Wait for it.

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.450
[Chloe] There! See?

01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:26.380
[Chloe] They're out there everyday.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.350
[Chloe] Little pricks.

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.080
[Chloe] We shouldn't have to put up with this.

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:40.230
[Chloe] I want to get their faces on
camera so I can show it to the police.

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:42.580
Oh God, don't even think of it.

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:46.680
You can't go messing with that sort of person. No.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.100
Please drop the idea.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.100
I can look after myself, I'm an adult.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.880
[Chloe] - They won't see me.
[Joe] - They'll go for you and they'll
steal that camera, that's for sure.

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:56.240
[Joe] - That's a good camera.
[Chloe] - Granddad, I can look after myself.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:58.030
[Joe] That's not the point!

01:02:58.630 --> 01:03:02.550
[Joe] Don't go. I'm telling you, please, don't go.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.330
[Drug Dealer 1] Oi!

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:12.600
[Chloe] Shit!

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.380
[Chloe] Fuck!

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.330
[Drug Dealer 1] I said, what the
fuck do you think you're doing?

01:03:17.330 --> 01:03:18.550
[Chloe] I'm not doing anything.

01:03:18.550 --> 01:03:20.550
[Drug Dealer 1] You making videos of us?

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.100
[Drug Dealer 1] Gimme that!

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:24.580
[Drug Dealer 1] Diesel!
Oi Diesel, come here bruv!

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.250
[Diesel] What's going on?

01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:28.580
[Drug Dealer 1] Think she likes you,
Fam, she's making videos of you.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:30.580
[Drug Dealer 1] Stay there!

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:33.450
[Diesel] Fucking Steven Spielberg eh?

01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:37.700
[Diesel] Let's make a video of you.
Fucking nosey little bitch.

01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:41.630
[Drug Dealer 1] - Put her titties all over YouTube!
[Joe] - Chloe!

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:45.430
[Joe] I've called the police, you better clear off!

01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:47.250
[Drug Dealer 1] Fuck off, Gramps!

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:49.350
[Diesel] Careful old man, you don;t want us to hurt this little girl -

01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:51.350
[Chloe] No!!!

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.930
[Joe] - [Argh!!!]

01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:53.930
[Drug Dealer 1 on screen] That was fucking nuts!

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.100
[Diesel] You fucking idiot!

01:03:56.730 --> 01:03:58.680
[Drug Dealer 1] Ah that was fucking mad! I can't lie.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.080
[Drug Dealer 2] She ain't gonna film us again, is she bruv?

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.050
[Drug Dealer 1] Nah!
[Diesel] Let's go!

01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:01.872
[Laughing]

01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:04.080
[Drug Dealer 1] [Argh!!!]

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.080
[Long beep - no camera audio]

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.250
[Chloe] Hi

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:50.380
[Ed] Hey!

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:53.080
[Ed] You okay?

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.380
[Chloe] I feel like shit.

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:55.500
[Laughs]

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:59.980
[Ed] Listen, I was thinking. Why don't
we just get the fuck out of here?

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.980
[Ed] Go stay at mine or something?

01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:04.980
[Chloe] You don't even like staying at yours.

01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:12.150
[Chloe] Do you think I'm crazy?

01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:13.850
[Ed] Hmm?

01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:17.200
[Ed] Not at all.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.280
[Chloe] You fucking genius.
You brilliant man!

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.180
Yeah, okay.

01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:29.630
[Chloe] No, you're fucking amazing!

01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:30.550
Yeah, alright, stop, stop, stop.

01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:33.830
[Chloe] No! Look what you've done - you're so good!

01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:35.830
Ah, I've cured cancer.

01:05:36.928 --> 01:05:39.230
[Chloe] How long did it take you to find this?

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:40.250
[Ed] About 3 hours.

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:41.600
[Chloe] Her name is Anna West?

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:42.780
[Ed] Hmm mm.

01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:51.030
[Chloe] That's definitely her.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.550
[Chloe] She's just like Amelia.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:07.250
[Chloe] Just like Amelia. Oh my God.

01:06:08.330 --> 01:06:11.700
[Chloe] Sid, we need to speak to you.
Could you come over right away?

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.330
[Kimberley] Can I have a word? Ed?

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:23.900
[Kimberley] I'm really scared,
Chloe. I don't know what to do.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.250
[Kimberley] I mean - swallowing cigarettes?

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:28.250
[Chloe] Do you really think
that I did this to myself?

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:29.100
[Kimberley] Well who else did it to you?

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:33.400
[Chloe] She did it! They did it!
That girl is not her niece.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.400
[Chloe] Listen!

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.700
[Chloe] - She's just like Amelia.
[Kimberley] - Listen to yourself!

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.700
[Chloe] It's the truth. I'll show you.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:40.700
[Kimberley] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:43.150
[Kimberley] Enough of this.

01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:48.000
[Kimberley] I tell you what, I'm taking you
to the psychologist first thing in the morning.
I don't want to hear any more about it.

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:53.280
[Ed] Ok, Mrs W, I've just got to say this, okay?

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.280
[Ed] I thought the whole thing
was absolutely fucking stupid.

01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:56.600
[Ed] But she's telling the truth.
Why would she does this to herself?

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.000
[Ed] - And you know what else we saw?
[Kimberley] - Ed stop!

01:06:58.030 --> 01:07:00.080
[Ed] Her name is Anna West.
She's on a missing persons website.

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.230
[Kimberley] Stop! Stop!

01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:03.780
[Kimberley] And turn that fucking camera off!

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:08.280
[Kimberley] In fact, I think it's time you
went home. First thing in the morning.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.680
[Chloe] - [Panicked breathing]

01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:25.340
[Distant laughter]

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.720
[Chloe] Ed! Wake up! Wake up!

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.720
[Ed] What?
[Chloe] Shh!

01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:34.050
[Laughing]

01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:36.050
[Chloe] Could you hear it?

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:38.930
[Ed] Is that your mum?

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:39.760
[Chloe] I don't know.

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.220
[Laughing]

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.220
[Floorboard creaks]

01:07:45.590 --> 01:07:47.500
[Laughing]
