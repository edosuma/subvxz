WEBVTT

00:00.771 --> 00:02.565
- Tonight on "Hotel Hell,"

00:02.565 --> 00:05.797
I'm in Oregon, trying to
save a family run hotel

00:05.797 --> 00:08.132
that's way, way out of control.

00:08.132 --> 00:09.245
Holy fucking...

00:10.958 --> 00:12.898
The dad is a stoner hippy.

00:12.898 --> 00:14.066
- I'm not a businessman.

00:14.066 --> 00:15.640
- Why are you talking so much bullshit?

00:15.640 --> 00:17.173
- I'm gonna knock him on his ass.

00:17.173 --> 00:19.102
- [Gordon] And the sons are
at each other's throats.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.696
- Grow up and turn into a real man.

00:20.696 --> 00:21.565
- Fuck you.

00:21.565 --> 00:22.433
- My God.

00:22.433 --> 00:24.232
And Mum is drowning in debt.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.973
You owe a million on it?
- Yes.

00:25.973 --> 00:27.089
- Can I fix a business

00:27.089 --> 00:28.799
where they spend more time getting high-

00:28.799 --> 00:30.050
- Smoke time!
- Than working.

00:30.050 --> 00:33.517
It definitely smells of a
business that's run by stoners.

00:33.517 --> 00:36.037
- (laughs) Yeah, I know.

00:36.037 --> 00:39.512
(lively dramatic music)

01:02.062 --> 01:03.918
- [Gordon] The Applegate
River Lodge is located

01:03.918 --> 01:06.118
in beautiful Applegate, Oregon.

01:06.118 --> 01:08.057
The Lodge is nestled
amongst gorgeous rivers

01:08.057 --> 01:09.121
and lush vineyards,

01:09.121 --> 01:12.197
And boasts some of the North
West's most stunning views.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.907
Owners Joanna and Richard Davis

01:13.907 --> 01:16.201
built the Lodge 22 years ago.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.620
- Richard actually designed
the Lodge and built it.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.925
Having that much workload, the
stress was just unbearable.

01:21.925 --> 01:23.896
- [Gordon] Once this labour
is love was completed,

01:23.896 --> 01:26.753
Richard decided it was time
to take a break and relax

01:28.046 --> 01:29.582
for 20 years!

01:30.767 --> 01:33.385
The couple got divorced, so
Richard now lives on site

01:33.385 --> 01:36.096
in a hut next to the main Lodge.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.451
- My given name was Richard,

01:37.451 --> 01:41.226
but at this stage of my
life I just go by Pa Butt.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.675
The Applegate River Lodge?

01:42.675 --> 01:45.324
It's been a way of life here for my family

01:45.324 --> 01:47.078
for about 22 years.

01:47.951 --> 01:50.360
Right now my duties are making sure

01:50.360 --> 01:53.780
that the energy that was
given to me to steward

01:53.780 --> 01:56.574
is here on the property at all times.

01:56.574 --> 01:58.766
And, yeah, it's pot.

01:58.766 --> 02:00.884
(coughs) Let me grab my guitar.

02:02.153 --> 02:03.978
See, where is my guitar?

02:03.978 --> 02:05.646
- [Gordon] While Richard
is looking for his guitar,

02:05.646 --> 02:08.399
back on earth, his ex-wife
Joanna is desperately looking

02:08.399 --> 02:10.985
for the money to keep the
the Lodge's doors open.

02:10.985 --> 02:12.236
- We could easily lose anywhere

02:12.236 --> 02:14.259
from 5 to 15,000 dollars a month,

02:14.259 --> 02:16.261
just because of lack of business.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.129
- What's going on?

02:17.129 --> 02:18.815
- Just seeing if we've got
any reservations coming up.

02:18.815 --> 02:20.091
What are you doing?

02:20.091 --> 02:22.329
- Nothing, just screwing off.

02:22.329 --> 02:25.749
- I actually live in my motor
home, I rented my house out.

02:25.749 --> 02:27.042
Did you need something?

02:27.042 --> 02:28.325
- No, I'm just hanging out.

02:28.325 --> 02:31.224
I don't see the Applegate
River Lodge as a business.

02:31.224 --> 02:32.739
Never have, never will.

02:35.478 --> 02:36.854
- [Gordon] All the pressure
of running the Lodge

02:36.854 --> 02:38.231
falls on Joanna's shoulders.

02:38.231 --> 02:41.088
She had high hopes her
two sons Duke and Dusty

02:41.088 --> 02:42.819
would take charge of the business.

02:42.819 --> 02:45.206
- I just totally fucking
disagree with what you're doing.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.437
- Should be none of your concern.

02:46.437 --> 02:47.305
- Right there, there's a big window.

02:47.305 --> 02:48.174
- You don't have anything to do

02:48.174 --> 02:49.523
with this goddamn restaurant!

02:49.523 --> 02:50.806
- [Gordon] But their constant fighting

02:50.806 --> 02:52.147
has gotten in the way.

02:52.147 --> 02:54.904
- My brother and I have
a rocky relationship,

02:54.904 --> 02:58.741
and led to fist fights and
all sorts of arguments.

02:58.741 --> 03:00.482
- [Gordon] The brother
refuse to work together,

03:00.482 --> 03:03.725
so Dusty runs the restaurant
and bar as a separate business.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.716
- I'll grab you a menu, and
we can get you something else.

03:05.716 --> 03:07.885
- [Gordon] With his
girlfriend and head chef Cami.

03:07.885 --> 03:10.169
- Way too much olive oil on
them, they turned them back.

03:10.169 --> 03:11.670
- [Gordon] While Duke and his wife Melissa

03:11.670 --> 03:13.870
use the hotel's lobby as a concert venue,

03:13.870 --> 03:15.687
organising regular music nights.

03:15.687 --> 03:17.214
- How's everybody feeling tonight?

03:17.214 --> 03:20.082
(crowd cheering)

03:21.951 --> 03:25.121
- Dusty's a lot more into
deadlines and numbers,

03:25.121 --> 03:29.097
and I'm a lot more into
feelings and ideas and concepts.

03:30.565 --> 03:33.338
- A lotta people say there's
too much pot smoking,

03:33.338 --> 03:35.423
too much music, too much of this,

03:35.423 --> 03:38.259
and too much of that, too much fun.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.587
That's not my take on it.

03:41.367 --> 03:42.754
- [Gordon] And if that's
not enough of a headache

03:42.754 --> 03:44.391
for guests trying to sleep,

03:44.391 --> 03:47.060
Richard holds after hours jam sessions.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.847
- What time is it?
- What, 1:11.

03:52.369 --> 03:55.497
- Wow, that music could be an issue.

03:56.757 --> 03:59.145
- I have had to comp some
rooms here at the Lodge.

03:59.145 --> 04:00.730
It was too noisy for them,

04:00.730 --> 04:02.534
or they didn't think the
room was clean enough.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.431
- Ew, there's spider webs

04:04.431 --> 04:06.422
all over it.
- This is disgusting, urgh!

04:06.422 --> 04:08.157
- [Woman] Urgh, so gross.

04:09.061 --> 04:11.824
- [Joanna] I've had to
comp quite a few rooms.

04:11.824 --> 04:14.723
- [Gordon] Unsurprisingly, the
inn is haemorrhaging money,

04:14.723 --> 04:16.277
dragged down by a co-owner

04:16.277 --> 04:18.164
who doesn't treat the Lodge as a business

04:18.164 --> 04:20.406
and two fighting sons.

04:20.406 --> 04:22.376
If I can't get this
family working together,

04:22.376 --> 04:23.985
their business is doomed.

04:24.858 --> 04:26.005
- This Lodge is my life.

04:26.005 --> 04:29.279
It's the legacy to carry
on through generations,

04:29.279 --> 04:31.782
but the family is so dysfunctional

04:31.782 --> 04:33.398
that Gordon's just gonna
say, "You know what?

04:33.398 --> 04:35.014
I can't fix you guys."

04:35.014 --> 04:36.839
- We have to save the business.

04:36.839 --> 04:39.008
We have to save our family.

04:39.008 --> 04:41.565
I think Gordon's our only hope.

04:46.828 --> 04:50.248
- My first time in Oregon,
beautiful countryside.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.636
I'm on my way to the
Applegate River Lodge.

04:52.636 --> 04:54.617
Now, if they've got a lodge here

04:54.617 --> 04:55.993
and they're not making a fortune,

04:55.993 --> 04:58.340
they must be doing
something seriously wrong.

05:02.364 --> 05:04.974
That is beautiful, my goodness me.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.807
What's that dump?

05:07.807 --> 05:09.114
And what's that smell?

05:12.253 --> 05:14.443
- Are you ready to go back to sleep, Troo?

05:16.681 --> 05:17.549
- Ghastly.

05:18.891 --> 05:20.487
Wow.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.355
Hello.

05:23.396 --> 05:24.355
It is huge.

05:27.803 --> 05:29.009
But it's so empty.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.238
Where's all the furniture
and where is everybody?

05:32.238 --> 05:33.148
Am I too late?

05:34.532 --> 05:35.401
Wow.

05:40.180 --> 05:42.154
"Press the button for the Buzz

05:42.154 --> 05:44.250
to summon a human with answers."

05:44.250 --> 05:45.241
You are kidding me?

05:46.845 --> 05:48.921
(buzzer buzzing)

05:48.921 --> 05:52.324
- Just relax, I gotta do
exactly what I'm doing.

05:56.012 --> 05:57.303
- Hello?

05:57.303 --> 06:02.516
(buzzer buzzing)
(guitar strums)

06:04.265 --> 06:07.044
It's like this place hasn't
been finished off inside.

06:07.044 --> 06:08.775
Hello?

06:08.775 --> 06:11.089
Hello-hello-hello-hello!

06:11.089 --> 06:13.759
Where are the guests supposed to sit?

06:13.759 --> 06:17.161
(Richard whistling)

06:17.161 --> 06:18.847
- Hey, hey, hello.

06:18.847 --> 06:20.073
What are you doing, Gord?

06:20.073 --> 06:21.352
- [Gordon] How are you?

06:21.352 --> 06:22.220
- I'm doing good.

06:22.220 --> 06:23.425
- I thought you'd gone!

06:23.425 --> 06:26.094
- No, I was just hanging out.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.147
- Sorry, I didn't catch your first name.

06:27.147 --> 06:28.096
- Richard.
- Richard.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.984
- But around here they
kinda call me Pa Butt.

06:30.984 --> 06:31.987
- Po Butt?

06:31.987 --> 06:32.867
- Pa Butt.

06:32.867 --> 06:33.736
- Pa Butt.

06:33.736 --> 06:36.198
- We're just buttlings all
of us running around here.

06:37.501 --> 06:39.065
- [Gordon] Do you normally
run the front desk?

06:39.065 --> 06:40.775
- This bell goes to my room.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.455
And then when music starts
coming, I turn it all round.

06:43.455 --> 06:44.324
- Music?

06:44.324 --> 06:46.416
- The music programme
we're gonna do tonight.

06:46.416 --> 06:48.126
- So there's music, there's
a band playing tonight?

06:48.126 --> 06:51.557
- Yes, and then we'll
probably jam out later

06:51.557 --> 06:52.671
in the Butt Hut.

06:52.671 --> 06:53.778
- What is the Butt Hut?

06:53.778 --> 06:55.488
Just help me understand.
- Would you like to see

06:55.488 --> 06:57.062
the Butt Hut? (laughs)

06:57.062 --> 06:58.262
- I'd love to see the Butt Hut.

06:58.262 --> 06:59.130
- Okay.

06:59.130 --> 07:00.824
- Yeah, this is where you
run the reception from?

07:00.824 --> 07:01.693
The Butt Hut?

07:01.693 --> 07:02.562
- [Richard] Yeah.

07:05.029 --> 07:06.822
- [Gordon] Wow, this is the Butt Hut?

07:06.822 --> 07:08.713
- This is where me and Troopy hang out.

07:08.713 --> 07:09.581
(Gordon coughs)

07:09.581 --> 07:11.327
Troopy, get up!

07:11.327 --> 07:13.495
- Smell, what is that smell?

07:13.495 --> 07:15.341
- Incense, they're right here.
- Incense?

07:15.341 --> 07:17.468
That is a strong fucking incense.

07:17.468 --> 07:18.459
Jesus!

07:18.459 --> 07:20.878
But that doesn't smell like
the smell I've just smelt.

07:20.878 --> 07:22.692
- Yeah, it's herbs, it's a medicinal herb.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.246
- I love herbs, especially
the freshness of them.

07:24.246 --> 07:25.653
- You can use it for cooking

07:25.653 --> 07:28.177
if you wanna do a really nice fettuccini.

07:28.177 --> 07:29.439
- Okay.

07:29.439 --> 07:32.765
What's it like, a basil?
- Yeah, it's like a basil.

07:32.765 --> 07:33.682
- [Gordon] Wow.

07:33.682 --> 07:35.142
- It has a nice smell to it.

07:36.571 --> 07:37.874
- Fuck me.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.334
That's definitely not basil.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.815
Is this cannabis?

07:41.815 --> 07:42.684
- Yes.

07:45.580 --> 07:46.873
So we smoke pot.

07:46.873 --> 07:49.156
- Oof, that's what I could
smell the minute I came in here.

07:49.156 --> 07:50.348
- What do you want me to do?

07:50.348 --> 07:51.217
- [Gordon] Is this legal here?

07:51.217 --> 07:53.330
- Yes, I use medicinal herb.

07:54.870 --> 07:56.643
- Before you put your hands
back in that cookie jar,

07:56.643 --> 07:57.511
do you mind if I see my room?

07:57.511 --> 07:58.572
It's getting a bit late.

07:58.572 --> 08:00.035
- Oh, oh, I know!

08:00.974 --> 08:01.877
I'm done for a while.

08:01.877 --> 08:02.746
- Oh, okay, you're done for a while?

08:02.746 --> 08:03.663
- Yeah, I'm medicated.

08:03.663 --> 08:04.766
- So how do I get to the room?

08:04.766 --> 08:06.747
- [Richard] I'll show you.

08:06.747 --> 08:07.779
- This a first.

08:07.779 --> 08:10.062
The owner of this lodge is high as a kite.

08:10.062 --> 08:11.647
Wow, look at this place!

08:11.647 --> 08:15.213
He probably hasn't even noticed
the place has no furniture.

08:15.213 --> 08:16.663
- [Richard] This is the Cattlemen Room.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.270
- [Gordon] Cattlemen Room, thank you.

08:19.270 --> 08:21.900
It smells like cattle in here, wow.

08:23.732 --> 08:25.755
What happened to the carpet,
did the dog have an accident?

08:25.755 --> 08:26.996
- You know, we party a lot here,

08:26.996 --> 08:28.758
so you're gonna have liquor.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.128
Who knows what's on these carpets, right?

08:32.813 --> 08:34.297
- What is that?

08:34.297 --> 08:35.306
- That's just bugs.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.275
- Oh, bugs.

08:36.275 --> 08:37.207
Bloody hell.

08:38.404 --> 08:39.868
Urgh!

08:39.868 --> 08:41.500
Got a crispy daddy longleg.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.225
That's disgusting.

08:45.179 --> 08:47.552
- [Richard] Now this
is your view out here.

08:47.552 --> 08:48.914
- [Gordon] No I didn't notice
the view 'cause of the carpet.

08:48.914 --> 08:50.436
My God, what a stunning location!

08:50.436 --> 08:53.126
- [Richard] It's paradise, it truly is.

08:53.126 --> 08:54.200
- Yeah, I'll say.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.077
I mean, this place is stunning.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.676
Shame it's so filthy, Richard.

08:58.903 --> 08:59.894
So the bedroom's up here, right?

08:59.894 --> 09:00.950
- [Richard] That's right.

09:01.854 --> 09:04.659
- [Gordon] What in the hell
has happened to this carpet?

09:04.659 --> 09:05.993
- I haven't been up there in a while.

09:05.993 --> 09:07.422
- There's more stains on this carpet

09:07.422 --> 09:09.403
than inside Hugh Heffner's
fucking Y-fronts.

09:09.403 --> 09:11.180
- Oh yeah I told you, they party in here.

09:11.180 --> 09:12.048
- No, but how?

09:12.048 --> 09:13.251
I mean, how many, look at this carpet!

09:13.251 --> 09:15.472
- Every room's got those
stains on them, you know?

09:15.472 --> 09:17.442
- [Gordon] And what about
the cover on the bed?

09:17.442 --> 09:19.111
When was that from, 1970?

09:19.111 --> 09:20.352
- [Richard] You have to
talk to Joanne about that.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.291
- Joanne, that's your wife?
- Ex-wife.

09:22.291 --> 09:24.168
- Ex, oh damn, damn.

09:24.168 --> 09:26.608
- Yeah, she wants to be a business.

09:26.608 --> 09:27.476
- Well, she should be.

09:27.476 --> 09:28.985
- This is not a business to me.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.010
Don't ask me finances,
'cause I would be lying

09:33.010 --> 09:35.106
if I told you I knew anything, I don't.

09:35.106 --> 09:36.972
- Let's catch up later, I'm
gonna unpack my bags, okay?

09:36.972 --> 09:38.151
- Okay, cool.

09:38.151 --> 09:39.329
- Thanks for the update.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.903
This place is disgusting.

09:40.903 --> 09:41.772
Wow.

09:41.772 --> 09:43.541
And it's hardly surprising
seeing that the owner

09:43.541 --> 09:44.823
doesn't see it as a business.

09:44.823 --> 09:45.846
I need some fresh air, fuck me.

09:45.846 --> 09:48.599
He clearly doesn't care
about paying guests.

09:48.599 --> 09:51.226
Kids, don't do drugs.

09:51.226 --> 09:53.040
You'll end up like that.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.451
Fucking useless.

09:56.492 --> 09:59.995
I've just arrived at Oregon's
Applegate River Lodge.

09:59.995 --> 10:00.864
Hello?

10:00.864 --> 10:03.177
The hotel lobby has no furniture.

10:03.177 --> 10:04.635
It is so bare in here!

10:04.635 --> 10:05.994
The rooms are disgusting.

10:07.096 --> 10:07.982
- It's like a basil.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.599
- [Gordon] And I've
discovered one of the owners

10:09.599 --> 10:11.020
is a carefree hippy.

10:12.675 --> 10:14.291
- This is not a business to me.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.587
- Richard says his ex-wife
is the businesswoman here.

10:18.587 --> 10:20.464
I hope she has a better
head on her shoulders.

10:20.464 --> 10:21.944
Hello.
- Joanna.

10:21.944 --> 10:23.257
- Joanna, Gordon, nice to see you.

10:23.257 --> 10:24.207
- Nice to meet you.

10:24.207 --> 10:27.408
- So, you're Joanna who
was married to Richard.

10:27.408 --> 10:29.827
- Yes.
- You deserve a medal.

10:29.827 --> 10:30.696
And what do you do?

10:30.696 --> 10:32.173
- Well, let's see.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.905
I check people in, I do the banking.

10:34.905 --> 10:37.366
I mean, I'm the only one
in the family that's ever,

10:37.366 --> 10:38.638
you know, taken care of the books

10:38.638 --> 10:40.744
and made sure that the
mortgage payment was paid.

10:40.744 --> 10:42.162
- Why is it all on your shoulders?

10:42.162 --> 10:43.518
You just sound like the only one

10:43.518 --> 10:44.467
who's actually in control of this.

10:44.467 --> 10:45.837
- I am the only one.

10:45.837 --> 10:46.907
I have always been.
- Does Richard have a?

10:46.907 --> 10:49.141
- No, he's never even
looked at the cheque book.

10:50.022 --> 10:51.505
I'm really tired.

10:51.505 --> 10:53.153
I'm getting tired of
holding everything up,

10:53.153 --> 10:54.873
and it's getting old.

10:54.873 --> 10:57.626
- Driving through here, those
vineyards, the mountains.

10:57.626 --> 10:59.798
I mean, you must be making a fortune.

11:00.716 --> 11:02.871
- Well, you know, I'm...

11:02.871 --> 11:05.384
Well, I owe 990,000 on this,

11:05.384 --> 11:08.670
and we lose from 5 to $15,000 a month.

11:08.670 --> 11:09.989
- This is crazy.
- Yeah.

11:09.989 --> 11:12.646
- But how can the
business not be in profit?

11:12.646 --> 11:15.230
- That's my, I don't know.
- That, I don't understand.

11:15.230 --> 11:16.874
- No, that's what I need you for.

11:16.874 --> 11:17.743
I, honestly.

11:17.743 --> 11:20.190
- Having seen the lobby and my bedroom,

11:20.190 --> 11:22.057
I can see why the hotel
might be struggling.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.017
But surely the restaurant
must be making money

11:24.017 --> 11:25.821
with that view on the river like that?

11:25.821 --> 11:28.966
- Well, the restaurant is
run by Dusty, my younger son.

11:28.966 --> 11:29.908
And then Duke and his wife

11:29.908 --> 11:31.439
run the music end of the business.

11:31.439 --> 11:33.797
- Okay, but what percentage
of the profits do you get?

11:33.797 --> 11:34.666
- None.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.031
- Bloody hell, it sounds nuts.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.325
- I know it sounds nuts.
- It's just crazy.

11:41.461 --> 11:43.828
Wow, I mean, look at this place.

11:43.828 --> 11:47.561
It's like a missed
opportunity beyond belief.

11:47.561 --> 11:48.430
I mean, I-
- I know.

11:48.430 --> 11:49.334
That's what everybody tells me.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.700
Everybody says, "You've
got a goldmine here."

11:50.700 --> 11:54.690
And I go, "Well, so far I
haven't found the gold." (laughs)

11:56.622 --> 11:58.833
- This place is a patch of heaven,

11:58.833 --> 12:01.742
so I'm shocked to hear
it's not making money.

12:01.742 --> 12:04.495
I can't wait to hear why
Joanna's sons aren't contributing

12:04.495 --> 12:05.780
to the Lodge's finances.

12:06.820 --> 12:08.535
Nice to see you, first name is?

12:08.535 --> 12:09.404
- Thank you, Melissa.

12:09.404 --> 12:10.272
- Melissa, Gordon,

12:10.272 --> 12:11.189
nice to see you too.
- Nice to meet you, pleasure.

12:11.189 --> 12:12.492
- Wow, hello, how are you?

12:12.492 --> 12:13.361
- Pleasure.
- Likewise, my pleasure.

12:13.361 --> 12:14.230
Good to see you.
- Yeah, very much.

12:14.230 --> 12:15.295
- Duke, right?
- Duke, yeah.

12:15.295 --> 12:17.070
- [Gordon] So, this is the
set up for the concert?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.551
- Yeah, I run the sound.

12:18.551 --> 12:19.854
- Okay, mixing?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:19.854 --> 12:20.723
- Okay, great.

12:20.723 --> 12:22.137
And how much is it to get in?

12:22.137 --> 12:23.006
- It's 15.

12:23.006 --> 12:24.421
- $15?
- $15, yeah.

12:24.421 --> 12:27.883
- So, out of that $15
charged, how much goes to mum?

12:27.883 --> 12:29.606
- None.
- None, wow.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.694
Let's have a quick word outside.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.481
The place has got a million dollars' debt.

12:42.032 --> 12:42.932
- Yeah, I know.

12:44.297 --> 12:47.770
And I've been sitting
waiting, and I can relate.

12:49.675 --> 12:51.688
- I think I know what's going on here.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.297
When was the last time you had a smoke?

12:56.422 --> 12:59.633
- Way earlier this after-
- 20 minutes ago.

12:59.633 --> 13:01.667
- No, no, no, this morning.

13:01.667 --> 13:02.535
- This morning.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.222
- It relieves stress.

13:05.222 --> 13:07.881
- But it definitely smells of a business

13:07.881 --> 13:09.060
that's run by stoners.

13:09.060 --> 13:11.416
- (laughs) Yeah, I know.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.439
- [Gordon] Duke isn't
taking any responsibility

13:13.439 --> 13:14.492
for the Lodge.

13:14.492 --> 13:17.036
Hopefully his brother
will have a better excuse

13:17.036 --> 13:19.174
for not sharing any profits with his mum.

13:20.342 --> 13:22.354
- Gordon wants to meet you.

13:22.354 --> 13:23.223
- [Gordon] Hello.

13:23.223 --> 13:24.189
- Hello, Dusty Davis.

13:24.189 --> 13:26.639
- Dusty, lucky Dusty by
the sounds of things.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.661
- Oh, yes, of course.

13:27.661 --> 13:28.530
- Ah, I would say.

13:28.530 --> 13:29.424
Hello.
- Hi, I'm Camilia.

13:29.424 --> 13:30.946
- Camilia, nice to...

13:30.946 --> 13:32.260
The chef, right?
- Yes.

13:32.260 --> 13:33.128
- [Gordon] Okay, great.

13:33.128 --> 13:34.689
- I'm a very hard worker.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.462
I think Gordon's going to like me.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.121
- So, are you making money here?

13:39.121 --> 13:40.382
- [Dusty] Yes, sir.

13:40.382 --> 13:42.186
- How much money do you make a month?

13:42.186 --> 13:43.719
- Last month, I made about 12,000.

13:43.719 --> 13:44.588
- Wow!

13:44.588 --> 13:45.943
So, you make about 150 grand a year.

13:46.889 --> 13:48.168
- With everything working right, yeah.

13:48.168 --> 13:51.084
- And you don't pay a dollar
profit to your mother?

13:51.967 --> 13:53.385
- Profit, excuse me?

13:53.385 --> 13:55.293
- The business is a
million dollars in debt.

13:55.293 --> 13:59.279
You make a shitload of money,
and your mum gets nothing.

14:00.183 --> 14:01.852
- I was shocked that
Dusty makes that much,

14:01.852 --> 14:02.720
and that bothers me

14:02.720 --> 14:05.084
because he should help me out financially.

14:05.084 --> 14:07.545
- Knowing full well that you
stand to inherit this business,

14:07.545 --> 14:10.204
there's still not a penny
that goes in to reducing debt,

14:10.204 --> 14:11.685
and this is your mother?

14:11.685 --> 14:12.831
- Correct.

14:12.831 --> 14:15.115
I really devoted my life to this place,

14:15.115 --> 14:17.148
and to be treated like I
don't care about my family

14:17.148 --> 14:18.963
and don't care about this business,

14:18.963 --> 14:20.433
it really cut to the core.

14:20.433 --> 14:23.606
I have no problem telling him
to get the fuck outta here.

14:23.606 --> 14:25.681
- I'd give you a kick up
the arse if that was my son.

14:29.442 --> 14:30.808
I don't understand why the boys

14:30.808 --> 14:32.330
are just in it for themselves.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.032
Why can't the business work as one,

14:34.032 --> 14:36.465
and everybody pull together?

14:39.361 --> 14:40.693
- Well, you haven't done
a damn thing around here.

14:40.693 --> 14:43.018
I work hard here, and I don't
see you do a fucking thing.

14:43.018 --> 14:44.707
- Because you can't take any criticism

14:44.707 --> 14:47.157
without wanting to punch
my fucking lights out.

14:48.106 --> 14:48.975
- Incredible.

14:48.975 --> 14:49.844
- Guys!
- How do you feel about it?

14:49.844 --> 14:50.831
- Shut the fuck up, both of you!

14:50.831 --> 14:52.475
- It's him, he hates me.
- Listen, listen.

14:52.475 --> 14:53.581
What would you like me to do?

14:53.581 --> 14:56.385
- I wanna see you grow up
and turn into a real man.

14:56.385 --> 14:57.254
I wanna see you-

14:57.254 --> 14:58.565
- Oh, like you're a fucking real man.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.421
- I wanna see you be able
to go and have a home and-

15:00.421 --> 15:01.714
- Guys, guys, guys!

15:01.714 --> 15:02.871
- Oh my God.

15:02.871 --> 15:05.363
No wonder this place is on its knees.

15:05.363 --> 15:06.232
- Fuck you!

15:11.463 --> 15:13.507
- [Gordon] I'm at
Oregon's Applegate Lodge,

15:13.507 --> 15:15.498
and I thought the answer
for saving this place

15:15.498 --> 15:17.021
was for everyone to work together.

15:17.021 --> 15:18.543
- You can't take any criticism

15:18.543 --> 15:20.847
without wanting to punch
my fucking lights out.

15:20.847 --> 15:23.642
- [Gordon] But the boys can't
even talk to each other.

15:23.642 --> 15:24.592
- This guy tells me he won't even be-

15:24.592 --> 15:25.852
- Listen to me!
- My fucking brother

15:25.852 --> 15:26.999
unless I move out.
- It's clearly not just

15:26.999 --> 15:29.168
the Lodge that's falling apart.

15:29.168 --> 15:30.305
- Fuck you!

15:30.305 --> 15:31.173
- My God!

15:33.329 --> 15:34.851
People have heard about my visit,

15:34.851 --> 15:37.604
and both the hotel and restaurant
are booked for the night.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.472
- [Dusty] Right this way, guys.

15:38.472 --> 15:39.825
- [Gordon] I feel sorry for all of them.

15:39.825 --> 15:42.014
- [Joanna] Hi there, come on
over here, I'll check you in.

15:42.014 --> 15:43.141
How are you folks doing tonight?

15:43.141 --> 15:45.799
- And I'm sorry about the
furniture in the lobby.

15:45.799 --> 15:47.426
They haven't got any.

15:47.426 --> 15:48.990
Please, take a seat on the stairs.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.784
The guests don't look
impressed with the hotel,

15:50.784 --> 15:52.598
and neither do the
customers in the restaurant.

15:52.598 --> 15:53.925
But at least they've
got furniture to sit on.

15:53.925 --> 15:55.955
- Bruschetta here, guys.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.540
Oh shit, that's right.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.750
Bruschetta here for you guys.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.804
- Oh, man.

16:00.804 --> 16:01.904
- Okay, fire it up.

16:01.904 --> 16:03.755
You got your tri-tip.

16:03.755 --> 16:04.912
I'm not looking forward to going

16:04.912 --> 16:06.862
to the dinner service with Gordon.

16:06.862 --> 16:09.427
The interaction I had with him beforehand,

16:09.427 --> 16:11.366
I just know it's gonna be a nightmare.

16:11.366 --> 16:12.718
- [Gordon] Everything okay with that?

16:12.718 --> 16:14.305
- [Customer] The soup is pretty cold,

16:14.305 --> 16:15.642
and it didn't have any salt.

16:15.642 --> 16:19.959
And then it's just water and potato.

16:19.959 --> 16:20.827
- My apologies.

16:23.639 --> 16:25.649
- [Dusty] Potatoes here,
they're just firing off, guys.

16:25.649 --> 16:28.613
And we got a cream of horseradish
coming right up, guys.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.897
- The dog at the table,
is that normal there?

16:30.897 --> 16:32.535
The dog, does he sit there like
that, in front of customers?

16:32.535 --> 16:33.952
- Yes, sir, some request him to stay.

16:33.952 --> 16:34.994
Some call him over, yes.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.350
- Some customers call the dog over?

16:36.350 --> 16:37.219
- Oh yes, of course.

16:37.219 --> 16:38.310
- The food's that bad?

16:40.104 --> 16:41.032
While I'm trying to figure out

16:41.032 --> 16:42.471
what's wrong in the restaurant,

16:42.471 --> 16:44.806
guests in the hotel are
enjoying the unique charm

16:44.806 --> 16:46.029
of the Applegate Lodge.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.780
- [Guest] Look, a goober
of some kind here.

16:49.780 --> 16:51.793
- Look at this, you got
your dry cleaner hangers.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.336
- I just don't know
about the bear, though.

16:53.336 --> 16:55.974
I mean that's kind of-
- Oh my gosh!

16:55.974 --> 16:57.277
- [Guest] Where's the TV?

16:59.383 --> 17:01.586
I hope the restaurant's
better than the rooms.

17:01.586 --> 17:04.430
(duck quacking)

17:04.430 --> 17:05.577
- Cam, I need that Thousand Island

17:05.577 --> 17:06.955
that goes with this one here.

17:06.955 --> 17:10.330
- [Camilia] Have we got ketchup?

17:10.330 --> 17:11.750
- Okay, are we adding ketchup to a ranch,

17:11.750 --> 17:14.555
and that will be a Thousand right here?

17:14.555 --> 17:16.077
- Was that ketchup in the salad?

17:16.077 --> 17:16.945
- [Camilia] Yeah.

17:16.945 --> 17:17.814
- [Gordon] What for?

17:17.814 --> 17:19.425
- [Camilia] For the Thousand Island.

17:19.425 --> 17:20.832
- Fucking hell.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.980
I can't believe this
restaurant is making money.

17:22.980 --> 17:24.108
The guests must be coming for the view,

17:24.108 --> 17:25.882
because the food is dreadful.

17:27.557 --> 17:29.111
- [Customer] This is
grilled salmon with pepper,

17:29.111 --> 17:30.164
but it tastes like you literally

17:30.164 --> 17:31.363
just sprinkled it with sugar.

17:31.363 --> 17:32.604
- The salmon is gross.

17:32.604 --> 17:33.563
I'll be more than happy to,

17:33.563 --> 17:35.670
I'll just take that off
here now, certainly.

17:35.670 --> 17:37.828
- I can't stand to watch
another minute of this.

17:37.828 --> 17:39.841
Thank goodness dinner
service is almost over,

17:39.841 --> 17:41.592
because this place is a joke.

17:41.592 --> 17:44.847
Oh dear, got two minutes?

17:44.847 --> 17:47.453
(tense music)

17:49.079 --> 17:51.658
I'm embarrassed, I'm
amazed you're still open.

17:52.843 --> 17:54.772
There's no fucking standards in here.

17:54.772 --> 17:56.378
- I don't believe that
there's no standards.

17:56.378 --> 17:59.006
- You got a river running
outside your patio

17:59.006 --> 18:02.394
with salmon in it and you're
serving frozen salmon.

18:02.394 --> 18:03.503
Where's the standard there?

18:03.503 --> 18:05.575
- What we do here is not shit.

18:05.575 --> 18:09.182
- You may be able to
manipulate your mother,

18:09.182 --> 18:11.737
but you are not gonna pull
the wool over my eyes.

18:12.947 --> 18:13.892
Because you're playing
at running a restaurant

18:13.892 --> 18:15.504
that's been given to you.

18:16.419 --> 18:17.618
You haven't actually
worked for this, have you?

18:17.618 --> 18:18.616
You grew up here, so.

18:18.616 --> 18:21.413
"Hey, Mum, I wanna be a
restaurateur this week."

18:21.413 --> 18:24.795
Without your mother in
this Lodge, you're fucked.

18:32.049 --> 18:33.321
It's nearly 10 o'clock,

18:33.321 --> 18:35.730
when many hotel guests will
be thinking of heading to bed,

18:35.730 --> 18:38.503
but the music concert
is just about to start.

18:38.503 --> 18:40.224
- We've been doing this for 20 years,

18:40.224 --> 18:41.256
we've been playing music.

18:41.256 --> 18:42.890
I think Gordon's gonna like it.

18:42.890 --> 18:45.583
(lively music)

18:53.350 --> 18:57.434
- This is the noisiest
hotel I've ever been in.

19:02.931 --> 19:04.234
Holy fucking...

19:07.050 --> 19:07.918
Oh my God.

19:08.805 --> 19:09.993
I don't do drugs,

19:09.993 --> 19:12.183
so I never thought I'd
see a dancing mushroom.

19:12.183 --> 19:13.340
But I was wrong.

19:13.340 --> 19:15.238
- [Richard] Mr. Ramsay,
do you know who this is?

19:15.238 --> 19:16.717
- I recognise the smell.

19:16.717 --> 19:18.533
(Richard and Gordon laughing)

19:18.533 --> 19:20.233
It's like the summer of love.

19:20.233 --> 19:23.917
These people are weird,
but they sure are friendly.

19:23.917 --> 19:26.134
- Okay, buddy.
- Oh, okay.

19:27.228 --> 19:28.345
Right, there we go, excellent.

19:28.345 --> 19:29.385
Always good at hugging.

19:29.385 --> 19:30.451
- Cool.
- Excellent.

19:30.451 --> 19:31.320
Nice to see you.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.639
- I love you.
- I love you too.

19:35.129 --> 19:37.260
Is this a dream, is this really happening?

19:37.260 --> 19:38.949
Sorry, are you checking in?

19:38.949 --> 19:40.141
I am so sorry.

19:41.011 --> 19:43.548
Welcome to the fucking madhouse.

19:43.548 --> 19:47.791
- Your room is up these log
stairs, right behind you here.

19:47.791 --> 19:49.272
- [Gordon] It's insane
how guests are trying

19:49.272 --> 19:51.118
to check in over this racket.

19:51.118 --> 19:52.598
If I had arrived to this,

19:52.598 --> 19:55.153
I would have gotten on
the first plane back home.

19:57.574 --> 19:59.237
- I don't think I'll
be able to relax here.

19:59.237 --> 20:01.131
- You can't really escape the sound.

20:03.192 --> 20:04.061
- Wow.

20:04.061 --> 20:07.050
And the longer the music goes
on, the more guests complain.

20:07.050 --> 20:08.735
- [Woman] I can't hear anything.

20:08.735 --> 20:11.343
- You guys wanna come back here?

20:11.343 --> 20:13.974
You know what, it's on me tonight, okay?

20:13.974 --> 20:15.434
We're gonna make you
happy, no matter what.

20:15.434 --> 20:16.622
- Okay.
- Okay?

20:16.622 --> 20:18.072
- All right.
- All right.

20:18.072 --> 20:20.147
- [Gordon] With Joanna
giving away rooms for free,

20:20.147 --> 20:21.523
the Lodge is losing money,

20:21.523 --> 20:23.747
pushing this hotel further into debt.

20:24.773 --> 20:26.455
- And thank you guys so much
for being a part of this.

20:26.455 --> 20:28.362
How about it, one more
time for Polyrhythmics!

20:28.362 --> 20:29.865
(crowd cheering)

20:29.865 --> 20:31.888
- It's way past midnight,

20:31.888 --> 20:33.671
and with the band finally wrapping up,

20:33.671 --> 20:35.412
it's time for me to get some sleep.

20:35.412 --> 20:37.581
Before I dive under those covers,

20:37.581 --> 20:39.614
I'm dying to see what's on top of them.

20:40.813 --> 20:42.190
That is disgusting.

20:42.190 --> 20:44.275
I am not putting my head on that pillow.

20:46.159 --> 20:48.675
Urgh, I just touched that!

20:48.675 --> 20:51.389
It's like a mosaic of semen.

20:53.409 --> 20:54.278
Look at that.

20:54.278 --> 20:56.433
Urgh, disgusting.

20:56.433 --> 20:57.674
Oh, look at the lampshade.

20:57.674 --> 20:58.915
And look at that.

20:58.915 --> 21:03.839
How can they charge money for
people to sleep in this filth?

21:05.129 --> 21:05.998
Wow.

21:07.743 --> 21:12.008
This is definitely a
night for my sleeping bag.

21:13.544 --> 21:14.569
Right, lights out.

21:15.954 --> 21:19.082
(jazzy brass music)

21:20.520 --> 21:21.927
Oh, come on.

21:21.927 --> 21:23.677
It's like trying to
sleep above a nightclub.

21:23.677 --> 21:26.544
(crowd cheering)

21:28.555 --> 21:29.423
Aww shit.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.638
Holy fuck, I'm gonna jump out the window.

21:37.599 --> 21:38.687
This is crazy.

21:45.117 --> 21:47.091
Oh, for God's sake.

21:52.892 --> 21:55.759
(dramatic music)

21:56.729 --> 21:59.596
(crowd cheering)

22:02.916 --> 22:04.011
- [Duke] Hey, Gordon!

22:07.723 --> 22:10.455
- [Gordon] It's my first night
at Oregon's Applegate Lodge,

22:10.455 --> 22:13.760
and there's no way I can sleep
over this dreadful noise.

22:13.760 --> 22:14.796
I've had enough.

22:14.796 --> 22:20.009
(crowd cheering)
(crowd clapping)

22:20.819 --> 22:22.039
- Hey, Gordon, I'll be damned.

22:22.039 --> 22:23.927
- Yeah, no, I'm trying
to get to sleep up there.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.220
You got two seconds?

22:25.220 --> 22:26.951
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

22:26.951 --> 22:28.337
This is insane, my God!

22:28.337 --> 22:29.206
- Thank you.

22:30.423 --> 22:32.983
- How on earth is anyone supposed
to sleep with that racket?

22:32.983 --> 22:35.428
(crowd cheering)

22:35.428 --> 22:37.075
Can you get the family together?

22:37.075 --> 22:38.002
Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:38.002 --> 22:40.759
- And we'll just have a meeting together.

22:42.101 --> 22:43.032
- Holy shit!

22:47.044 --> 22:49.703
- I dunno what to say, I'm struggling.

22:49.703 --> 22:51.642
I've never seen anything quite as shoddy

22:51.642 --> 22:52.872
as I've experienced today,

22:52.872 --> 22:56.626
and I'm wondering why
this place is still open.

22:56.626 --> 22:57.940
How much money did we make tonight?

22:57.940 --> 22:58.809
How much money did you make?

22:58.809 --> 22:59.963
- About 1,500 bucks.

22:59.963 --> 23:00.831
- [Gordon] 1,500.

23:00.831 --> 23:03.101
How much money did you make tonight?

23:03.101 --> 23:03.970
- Couple hundred.

23:03.970 --> 23:04.839
- Couple of hundred.

23:04.839 --> 23:05.707
- About 500.

23:05.707 --> 23:06.876
- [Gordon] But with all
the noise complaints,

23:06.876 --> 23:08.659
Joanna had to comp free rooms.

23:08.659 --> 23:09.733
Isn't that right?

23:09.733 --> 23:10.995
- Absolutely.

23:10.995 --> 23:13.758
- You two make a profit,
but your mother loses money.

23:15.530 --> 23:16.782
It does not make sense.

23:16.782 --> 23:18.776
- Nobody says we were sensible people.

23:19.972 --> 23:21.151
We're just blessed people.

23:21.151 --> 23:23.622
- Having a million dollars
in debt is not blessed.

23:23.622 --> 23:25.019
- First of all, you don't understand

23:25.019 --> 23:25.888
what you're talking about.

23:25.888 --> 23:27.428
You're talking business.

23:27.428 --> 23:28.665
You're a businessman.
- But where's the business?

23:28.665 --> 23:30.024
- I'm not a businessman,

23:30.024 --> 23:33.455
and I don't try to teach these
people to be business people.

23:33.455 --> 23:34.591
This is our home.

23:34.591 --> 23:37.226
- No-one knows the difference
between a hotel and a home.

23:37.226 --> 23:38.314
And does anyone else know

23:38.314 --> 23:40.785
how much stress and pressure you're under?

23:40.785 --> 23:42.318
- You know, I do what I have to do

23:42.318 --> 23:44.129
to keep the doors open, you know?

23:44.129 --> 23:46.155
- Can we just quit talking about money?

23:46.155 --> 23:49.481
- Richard, why can't it
be financially secure

23:49.481 --> 23:50.990
so that both of the kids-
- We are financially secure.

23:50.990 --> 23:52.776
- No, Richard, we are not!
- Well...

23:52.776 --> 23:54.893
- You can laugh at this and laugh at that,

23:54.893 --> 23:56.519
and we just wanna make
everybody happy, man.

23:56.519 --> 23:58.073
- Listen, it ain't an issue with me.

23:58.073 --> 24:00.628
- You're refusing to look at the issue,

24:00.628 --> 24:04.204
because you and your sons are
taking advantage of Joanna.

24:04.204 --> 24:05.174
- No, it's not an issue.

24:05.174 --> 24:06.727
- So why are you talking so much bullshit?

24:06.727 --> 24:07.674
- It's not bullshit,

24:07.674 --> 24:08.804
it's straight up.
- Yes it is!

24:08.804 --> 24:10.815
Everything you say to me,
I'm just gonna ignore.

24:10.815 --> 24:12.348
- I'm gonna knock him on his ass.

24:12.348 --> 24:14.308
You think I care what you think about me?

24:14.308 --> 24:15.177
- Richard.

24:18.807 --> 24:20.022
Why don't you go have your cigarette?

24:20.022 --> 24:22.379
- I'll go have my cigarette,
relax a little bit.

24:22.379 --> 24:24.509
Then we'll come back
and then discuss this.

24:27.728 --> 24:30.011
- I'm not gonna argue with your father.

24:30.011 --> 24:31.870
I'm just gonna call it as I see it.

24:32.785 --> 24:36.997
This Lodge needs to be run by a business.

24:36.997 --> 24:40.511
And when I listen to your mum
stressing out about payments,

24:40.511 --> 24:44.640
and you two going off, running
your own little businesses,

24:44.640 --> 24:49.461
because you two are butting
heads, it's a fucking disgrace.

24:50.354 --> 24:52.214
This shit has to stop,

24:53.410 --> 24:56.291
because right now, this lady's suffering.

24:57.779 --> 25:01.835
Yet your heads are so
far in the fucking sand

25:01.835 --> 25:05.526
that no one can actually see
the damage you're causing.

25:05.526 --> 25:08.070
- My worst nightmare
is that Duke and Dusty

25:08.070 --> 25:09.551
never can get on the right page,

25:09.551 --> 25:12.575
and I'm stuck till I'm 90 years old

25:12.575 --> 25:15.598
trying to run this place,
and then I die and it's gone.

25:15.598 --> 25:16.485
- I'm not a miracle worker.

25:16.485 --> 25:17.872
If you want this place to survive,

25:17.872 --> 25:19.318
you need to come together as a family,

25:19.318 --> 25:23.137
and run this place as a
proper family business.

25:23.137 --> 25:26.213
It is way past everybody's bedtime.

25:26.213 --> 25:28.371
I'll see you in the morning, good night.

25:28.371 --> 25:31.673
(sighs) Fucking hell.

25:34.251 --> 25:36.182
(sighs) This place is insane.

25:36.182 --> 25:38.392
I mean, I've never seen

25:38.392 --> 25:40.592
such a badly run lodge in all my life,

25:40.592 --> 25:42.855
and the one person I
feel sorry for is Joanna.

25:42.855 --> 25:45.232
Everybody else, they
think it's a big joke.

25:45.232 --> 25:47.735
Well, I tell you what,
I'm not fucking laughing.

25:51.755 --> 25:54.449
(lively music)

25:57.985 --> 25:58.853
Oh, God!

25:59.796 --> 26:01.634
With all the partying
going on at this lodge,

26:01.634 --> 26:03.233
I hardly got a wink of sleep.

26:04.878 --> 26:06.684
I do not wanna stand on that carpet.

26:07.713 --> 26:09.423
This lodge is in a dreadful state

26:09.423 --> 26:11.415
and I think everyone's blind to it.

26:11.415 --> 26:12.801
That has to change.

26:12.801 --> 26:13.948
- [Joanna] Come on in.

26:16.868 --> 26:18.046
- [Gordon] Are you okay, my darling?

26:18.046 --> 26:18.915
- Yeah.

26:19.902 --> 26:22.926
- There's something I
want you to understand,

26:22.926 --> 26:24.122
because I think you're the only one

26:24.122 --> 26:27.389
who can actually appreciate some things

26:27.389 --> 26:28.744
that's been going on here.

26:29.620 --> 26:30.601
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:30.601 --> 26:31.716
- Will you come up with me?

26:31.716 --> 26:33.072
- What he might be showing me next,

26:33.072 --> 26:35.588
I don't know how much worse it could get.

26:36.753 --> 26:38.431
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.488
- Thank you so much for coming.

26:39.488 --> 26:43.176
This is Joanna, she is the owner.

26:43.176 --> 26:44.615
And these are esteemed guests

26:44.615 --> 26:47.419
that have been staying in your lodge.

26:47.419 --> 26:50.985
I need to hear the truth,
and so does Joanna.

26:50.985 --> 26:52.977
Let's start off with you, madam, please.

26:52.977 --> 26:54.572
- Me and my boyfriend
stayed here a few days ago.

26:54.572 --> 26:56.418
Both of us weren't really pleased.

26:56.418 --> 26:57.774
We were all the way in the Myrtle Suite,

26:57.774 --> 26:58.910
so we were the closest to the bar,

26:58.910 --> 27:00.620
and we could hear it
like we were next to it.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.977
- My apologies, I'm sorry.

27:02.977 --> 27:04.311
Please, madam, sir.

27:04.311 --> 27:05.490
- We got the Honeymoon Suite.

27:05.490 --> 27:09.035
And the bathroom wasn't
clean, so we, you know,

27:09.035 --> 27:13.049
I cleaned it and it just
kinda grossed us out.

27:13.049 --> 27:14.175
- The fact that you had to clean the room

27:14.175 --> 27:17.056
before you tried to relax, it's insane!

27:18.346 --> 27:19.215
Madam, please.

27:19.215 --> 27:21.141
- We got into bed and I felt something.

27:21.141 --> 27:24.102
I pulled it up with my foot,
and it was a pair of underwear.

27:24.102 --> 27:24.971
Dirty underwear.

27:24.971 --> 27:26.062
- [Gordon] Oh my God.

27:27.001 --> 27:30.275
- I am mortified, that is
completely unacceptable.

27:30.275 --> 27:32.663
- [Gordon] Did you have any
interactions with Richard?

27:32.663 --> 27:34.800
- Richard invited us to the back room.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.052
- What, in the, like, the Butt Hut?

27:37.052 --> 27:38.484
- Yes.

27:38.484 --> 27:39.353
- To do what?

27:39.353 --> 27:40.924
- There was marijuana in the back.

27:42.037 --> 27:45.144
He offered, which we did not partake.

27:45.144 --> 27:49.315
- Taking guests into the Butt room

27:49.315 --> 27:52.943
and offering them marijuana.

27:52.943 --> 27:55.391
It's not a hippy commune, it's a lodge!

27:55.391 --> 27:57.072
- I know.

27:57.072 --> 27:58.546
- [Gordon] I thank you for your time.

28:00.857 --> 28:03.099
The guests' feedback has hit Joanna hard,

28:03.099 --> 28:04.918
and now she's asked to speak to me alone.

28:04.918 --> 28:06.713
- [Joanna] Come on in.

28:06.713 --> 28:08.070
- Are you okay, my darling?

28:08.070 --> 28:10.388
- Well, I wanted to show you this book.

28:10.388 --> 28:11.504
It's the building of the Lodge,

28:11.504 --> 28:12.755
and you kinda see what we went through.

28:12.755 --> 28:13.724
- Oh wow, from the beginning?

28:13.724 --> 28:14.705
- From the beginning, yeah.

28:14.705 --> 28:16.436
- Wow!

28:16.436 --> 28:17.562
- We built it with our hands.

28:17.562 --> 28:19.793
We felled the trees, we
hand peeled the poles.

28:19.793 --> 28:20.930
We did it all.

28:20.930 --> 28:23.620
And it's an amazing story
how we pulled this together.

28:23.620 --> 28:26.154
I think if you understand the struggle

28:26.154 --> 28:28.802
that we went through to
get it to this place,

28:28.802 --> 28:32.962
you'll understand why I'm
so fired up about keeping it

28:32.962 --> 28:37.493
and having it run top notch.
- Wow.

28:37.493 --> 28:39.870
- And this is sort of ground zero?

28:39.870 --> 28:40.856
This is where it all started?
- Yeah, that's ground zero.

28:40.856 --> 28:42.628
Yeah, that's the Butt Hut, actually.

28:42.628 --> 28:44.471
- Seriously, that's incredible.

28:44.471 --> 28:46.664
- And the kids, you
know, they were all here.

28:46.664 --> 28:49.416
We grew up here, they're attached to it.

28:49.416 --> 28:51.460
It means so much to them.

28:51.460 --> 28:53.441
- Now I understand.

28:53.441 --> 28:55.881
I mean, it's clearly your little paradise,

28:55.881 --> 28:58.290
but I don't think it's
been paradise for guests.

28:58.290 --> 28:59.562
But, that's all gonna change.

28:59.562 --> 29:00.431
- Yeah.

29:00.431 --> 29:01.895
- Wow, look at that!

29:01.895 --> 29:03.347
- "And they lived happily ever after."

29:03.347 --> 29:05.547
That was my dream, and I
think that could still happen.

29:05.547 --> 29:07.093
- It is gonna happen, please.

29:08.112 --> 29:09.165
Let's go and do this, okay?

29:09.165 --> 29:10.291
- Okay, you bet.

29:10.291 --> 29:11.657
- I'll see you shortly.

29:11.657 --> 29:12.961
Thank you for that.
- Sure.

29:12.961 --> 29:15.995
- Now I can see why Joanna
loves this lodge so much.

29:15.995 --> 29:17.611
And I know that to save this place,

29:17.611 --> 29:19.509
I need to get her sons talking again.

29:19.509 --> 29:22.012
Clearly, their dad's not
gonna make that happen.

29:22.012 --> 29:23.795
He's too busy doing nothing.

29:23.795 --> 29:24.663
Come in here a minute.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.474
So, I've got to find a way

29:26.474 --> 29:28.990
to get these brothers on the same page.

29:31.573 --> 29:36.046
So, can you guys get this
thing settled once and for all?

29:36.046 --> 29:37.152
- I can't talk to him though,

29:37.152 --> 29:39.665
and have him not wanna punch me, okay?

29:39.665 --> 29:41.917
- I've been bullied my whole life, Gordon.

29:41.917 --> 29:43.752
- What are you talking about?

29:43.752 --> 29:46.463
You really think that you
haven't done anything to me?

29:46.463 --> 29:47.332
- No, no, what have I-

29:47.332 --> 29:48.653
- Tell me, tell me what I've done.

29:48.653 --> 29:50.665
- Tell me what I've said to
you that hurts you so bad,

29:50.665 --> 29:52.250
'cause you've said so many things to me.

29:52.250 --> 29:54.690
- You've resented me,
you've told me I'm a punk.

29:54.690 --> 29:56.233
- You said I'm a white trash tweaker.

29:56.233 --> 29:57.568
- You're living like one.

29:57.568 --> 29:59.643
- I'm ashamed that you're my brother.

29:59.643 --> 30:01.561
- That's a serious statement.

30:01.561 --> 30:02.430
- Shit!

30:03.386 --> 30:04.779
This is horrifying.

30:04.779 --> 30:06.056
- You know what, just leave.
- No.

30:06.056 --> 30:07.515
- Get the fuck off this property.

30:07.515 --> 30:09.642
- Did you guys get along, ever?

30:09.642 --> 30:10.938
Was there ever a time?

30:10.938 --> 30:13.805
(dramatic music)

30:17.661 --> 30:19.215
- Shit!

30:19.215 --> 30:20.539
This is horrifying.

30:20.539 --> 30:22.364
- You what what, just leave.
- No.

30:23.302 --> 30:24.762
- Did you guys get along, ever?

30:24.762 --> 30:25.763
- [Dusty] Get the fuck off this property.

30:25.763 --> 30:27.014
- Was there ever a time?

30:33.656 --> 30:35.898
- When is somebody gonna say, "Fuck it!

30:35.898 --> 30:37.816
This isn't about my big
brother or my little brother.

30:37.816 --> 30:39.542
This is about my mum."

30:39.542 --> 30:42.235
(solemn music)

30:48.126 --> 30:48.994
- All right.

30:48.994 --> 30:50.923
- The hatred has to stop.

30:50.923 --> 30:53.419
- I agree.
- The hatred has to stop.

30:56.158 --> 30:57.096
- Yeah.

30:57.096 --> 31:00.016
If we don't figure this out,
we're gonna lose the Lodge.

31:00.933 --> 31:02.237
I don't want that at all.

31:03.540 --> 31:06.804
- Dusty, why have we let
this go on for so long?

31:06.804 --> 31:11.207
And I love you, and I don't
wanna see you hurt, ever.

31:12.580 --> 31:13.449
- I'm sorry.

31:14.822 --> 31:15.691
I'm sorry.

31:17.241 --> 31:19.431
It's been such a long road
with Duke that, you know,

31:19.431 --> 31:22.309
I've just been praying every
day for something to change,

31:22.309 --> 31:24.408
because it taxes my mother so much.

31:25.479 --> 31:27.425
- I am so relieved to hear
that from both of you.

31:27.425 --> 31:28.944
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

31:33.195 --> 31:35.082
- Now that Duke and
Dusty have seen the pain

31:35.082 --> 31:35.958
they've caused their mother,

31:35.958 --> 31:38.377
I believe they're gonna be
willing to put their issues aside

31:38.377 --> 31:40.080
to save this piece of paradise.

31:41.870 --> 31:45.231
This lodge has so much potential
in this beautiful setting.

31:48.481 --> 31:50.295
It's somewhere I'd love to bring my wife

31:50.295 --> 31:52.186
and four kids for a vacation.

31:53.340 --> 31:56.291
It would be a tragedy if
Joanna and her family lost it.

31:56.291 --> 32:00.587
Wow, what an absolutely
beautiful place to go for a swim.

32:00.587 --> 32:02.891
But there's still one
problem I need to tackle

32:02.891 --> 32:05.564
to make sure this lodge
has a future it deserves.

32:06.895 --> 32:08.619
It's time to talk business.

32:09.627 --> 32:10.496
Take a seat.

32:11.525 --> 32:14.736
Richard, it's a business meeting.

32:14.736 --> 32:16.180
You're not really involved
running the business.

32:16.180 --> 32:17.468
- Right, right.
- Okay?

32:17.468 --> 32:20.586
And I think you need to let these guys

32:20.586 --> 32:21.566
deal with the business.

32:21.566 --> 32:25.181
So I would ask you to disappear.

32:25.181 --> 32:26.050
- Okay.

32:26.050 --> 32:26.918
- You're a nice guy.

32:26.918 --> 32:27.895
You're not gonna change,
and do you know what?

32:27.895 --> 32:29.758
I don't think your family
want you to change.

32:29.758 --> 32:31.691
- I don't want it.
- They love you as you are.

32:31.691 --> 32:32.559
- Yes.
- Okay?

32:32.559 --> 32:34.965
So I want you to have a relaxed afternoon.

32:34.965 --> 32:36.008
- Cool.
- Thank you.

32:36.008 --> 32:37.196
- That's why you're here.

32:37.196 --> 32:38.095
- Well, I appreciate that.

32:38.095 --> 32:39.136
- I've been talking years.

32:39.136 --> 32:40.919
- You take care.
- Okay.

32:40.919 --> 32:41.787
- [Duke] Okay, see you, Dad.

32:41.787 --> 32:43.445
- Thank you, Richard.
- See you.

32:44.652 --> 32:47.676
- Right now, it's not
your time, young man,

32:47.676 --> 32:48.642
and it's not your time.

32:48.642 --> 32:50.154
Do you know whose time it is?

32:52.034 --> 32:52.903
That's right.

32:53.942 --> 32:55.819
That's right, and she's at the helm.

32:55.819 --> 32:57.296
But she can't do it without you.

32:57.296 --> 32:58.238
- [Joanna] That's right.

32:58.238 --> 32:59.729
- All the personal shit,

32:59.729 --> 33:01.773
you leave when you walk through that door,

33:01.773 --> 33:03.775
because it's about business now.

33:03.775 --> 33:05.829
- Yeah, we've never had that.

33:05.829 --> 33:08.887
- You have the possibility
of turning this around.

33:09.833 --> 33:11.199
Joanna, what have you got to say?

33:11.199 --> 33:14.265
- I just really need you guys both.

33:14.265 --> 33:17.341
You know, I tried for many
years to do this on my own,

33:17.341 --> 33:18.209
but, you know what?

33:18.209 --> 33:20.583
It's time maybe you guys
help out a little more.

33:21.574 --> 33:23.211
Let's get this thing
going, man, let's roll.

33:23.211 --> 33:27.079
Do you realise how fricking
lucky we are to have this place?

33:27.079 --> 33:32.001
- Boys, are both of you
committed to working together

33:32.001 --> 33:33.930
and getting this place turned around?

33:37.496 --> 33:38.685
- Yeah.

33:38.685 --> 33:39.561
- I'm in it if you're in it.

33:39.561 --> 33:40.989
- Absolutely, man.

33:40.989 --> 33:42.459
- As businessmen and then brothers.

33:42.459 --> 33:43.429
- Yeah.
- We'll figure this out.

33:43.429 --> 33:45.372
We'll work the other shit out.

33:45.372 --> 33:47.882
- But we gotta be here for Mom, okay?

33:47.882 --> 33:48.778
- Okay.
- All right.

33:48.778 --> 33:49.987
- I love you.

33:49.987 --> 33:51.048
Love you.

33:51.048 --> 33:53.033
Big cuddle.
- I love you too.

33:53.033 --> 33:56.106
- It just warms my heart
to watch the boys embrace

33:56.106 --> 34:00.592
and to see that they really
want to work together

34:00.592 --> 34:02.722
and to help grow this place again.

34:03.648 --> 34:04.517
- All right.
- Cheers, buddy.

34:04.517 --> 34:05.566
It feels like a weight's been lifted

34:05.566 --> 34:06.434
off my shoulders right now,

34:06.434 --> 34:08.788
as in now that we're actually on some sort

34:08.788 --> 34:10.851
of a page together,

34:10.851 --> 34:13.688
I think we can really start
going somewhere with it.

34:13.688 --> 34:16.757
- I am just, like, stoked. (crying)

34:18.694 --> 34:20.632
These are tears of joy, not sorrow.

34:20.632 --> 34:21.917
Thank God!

34:21.917 --> 34:23.667
- There's a lot more
changes coming tomorrow.

34:23.667 --> 34:24.960
Thank you, Joanna.

34:24.960 --> 34:26.618
- Thank you.

34:26.618 --> 34:29.475
I thought Gordon was coming
here to fix the Lodge,

34:29.475 --> 34:32.460
but he ended up fixing our
family, which is amazing.

34:33.552 --> 34:34.420
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:34.420 --> 34:35.888
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

34:37.639 --> 34:38.568
- [Gordon] Coming up.

34:38.568 --> 34:41.036
Welcome to the new Applegate River Lodge.

34:41.036 --> 34:46.248
- I can't believe it. (laughs)

34:46.357 --> 34:50.079
- Welcome to the new
Applegate River Lodge.

34:50.079 --> 34:55.282
From this day forward, we
will run this as one business.

34:55.282 --> 34:57.733
Yes, there's a restaurant.

34:57.733 --> 35:00.308
Yes, it's a music venue.

35:00.308 --> 35:04.385
But they are all part
of the Lodge business,

35:04.385 --> 35:08.564
and they contribute to the
overall Lodge finances.

35:08.564 --> 35:10.452
Understood?
- Understood.

35:10.452 --> 35:13.498
- Good, I cannot wait for you
to see through those doors.

35:13.498 --> 35:14.367
Are you ready?

35:14.367 --> 35:15.236
- [Duke] Yeah, absolutely.

35:15.236 --> 35:16.104
- Let's go.

35:19.275 --> 35:20.651
- Whoa!

35:20.651 --> 35:21.955
Oh my God!

35:21.955 --> 35:23.394
- [Camilia] Oh my gosh!

35:23.394 --> 35:24.436
- [Joanna] Wow, God!

35:25.552 --> 35:26.887
- [Dusty] Nice!

35:26.887 --> 35:28.800
- Wow.
- Holy smokes.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.140
- Wow!
- Woo!

35:30.140 --> 35:32.643
This looks like a lodge, wow!

35:32.643 --> 35:33.814
Oh my God!

35:35.072 --> 35:37.794
- When I first got here,
I had to sit on the floor.

35:37.794 --> 35:40.671
Now your guests will feel
warm and very welcomed.

35:40.671 --> 35:43.153
- Yes, absolutely, wow!

35:43.153 --> 35:45.186
The lobby actually feels like a lobby now.

35:45.186 --> 35:48.909
The leather couches are
incredible, and the rocking chairs.

35:48.909 --> 35:50.796
I mean, people can come
down in the morning,

35:50.796 --> 35:53.267
have a cup of coffee, they can sit down.

35:53.267 --> 35:54.675
It's amazing.

35:54.675 --> 35:56.635
- Is it gorgeous?
- It's beautiful, yeah.

35:56.635 --> 35:57.504
- I love it.

35:57.504 --> 35:58.372
- [Gordon] Come over the reception desk.

35:58.372 --> 35:59.677
There's something else I wanna show you.

36:01.442 --> 36:02.415
Here is the magic.

36:03.632 --> 36:04.521
- [Camilia] Ooh!

36:05.436 --> 36:07.010
- [Dusty] Oh, yeah!
- I have given you

36:07.010 --> 36:09.336
a stunning brand new hotel management POS.

36:09.336 --> 36:11.014
Point of sale system.

36:11.014 --> 36:14.142
So now your guests can check in online.

36:14.142 --> 36:15.011
- Wow.

36:15.011 --> 36:17.312
- It works in here, it
works in the restaurant,

36:17.312 --> 36:19.637
and is gonna tap in to your music as well.

36:19.637 --> 36:20.524
- Perfect.

36:20.524 --> 36:21.493
- I love it.

36:21.493 --> 36:24.194
That system is gonna really
change everything we do here.

36:24.194 --> 36:26.811
Gordon has just, he's synced everything up

36:26.811 --> 36:28.730
and made this one business.

36:28.730 --> 36:31.076
It's really what this place
has needed for so long.

36:31.076 --> 36:32.786
- Now, would you like to see my room?

36:32.786 --> 36:33.777
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

36:33.777 --> 36:34.645
- Let's go.

36:36.646 --> 36:38.409
Here we go, go straight through.

36:40.773 --> 36:42.869
- Oh, cute, look at this!

36:42.869 --> 36:43.965
- [Dusty] Wonderful.

36:43.965 --> 36:45.186
- [Melissa] Oh, it's gorgeous.

36:45.186 --> 36:46.581
- Oh, nice.
- Wow.

36:46.581 --> 36:48.646
- Oh, it smells so good in here, too.

36:48.646 --> 36:49.647
- I love it.
- Wow!

36:49.647 --> 36:52.733
- [Gordon] So, the room is
fresh, it's vibrant, it's warm.

36:52.733 --> 36:54.495
And I've had all the carpets cleaned,

36:54.495 --> 36:56.122
so there are no more stains.

36:56.122 --> 36:58.346
- Ooh, nice.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.688
The curtains are gone, and
my 16-year-old curtains...

37:00.688 --> 37:01.802
- Oh!
- Gorgeous.

37:01.802 --> 37:03.108
- [Dusty] Oh, that's nice.

37:03.108 --> 37:04.443
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Way nice.

37:04.443 --> 37:06.372
- The disgusting bed ware all gone.

37:06.372 --> 37:07.800
And, with the blinds,

37:07.800 --> 37:12.139
guests no longer need to stare
down on Richard's Butt Hole.

37:12.139 --> 37:13.469
- Butt Hut!
- Butt Hut.

37:13.469 --> 37:14.338
- The Butt Hut.

37:14.338 --> 37:16.246
(all laughing)

37:16.246 --> 37:19.218
- The Cattlemen Room looks
like a really classy place now.

37:19.218 --> 37:22.683
I mean, the bed, the
furnishings, the lamps.

37:23.637 --> 37:25.724
It's not all that funky stuff
I had in there for years.

37:25.724 --> 37:26.892
(Joanna laughs)

37:26.892 --> 37:27.761
Oh, I love it.

37:27.761 --> 37:28.629
- It's stunning.

37:28.629 --> 37:30.142
- One last thing I'd like to
show you at the restaurant.

37:30.142 --> 37:31.355
Are you ready?
- Yep.

37:31.355 --> 37:32.224
- [Gordon] Yep, let's go.

37:32.224 --> 37:34.580
We've got some exciting
things happening there.

37:36.068 --> 37:37.048
- Holy moly.

37:37.048 --> 37:39.603
- Welcome to the new
Applegate River Lodge menu.

37:39.603 --> 37:41.720
The menu's small, the menu's dynamic.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.200
And the better the ingredients,

37:43.200 --> 37:44.639
the less that needs doing to them.

37:44.639 --> 37:46.005
Let's start off at the top, shall we?

37:46.005 --> 37:47.142
Half a roasted chicken

37:47.142 --> 37:49.383
and a lovely sage and lemon butter sauce.

37:49.383 --> 37:51.396
Next to that, the wild king salmon,

37:51.396 --> 37:53.148
with citronelle and grilled lemon,

37:53.148 --> 37:56.432
and then finally, 12 ounce
New York strip, stunning.

37:56.432 --> 37:59.070
- I like it, it's simple but it's perfect.

37:59.070 --> 38:01.055
- Now, sit down and enjoy.

38:05.045 --> 38:05.914
- Oh my God!

38:05.914 --> 38:08.488
This steak is just, oh, yum.

38:08.488 --> 38:09.831
- Wow.

38:09.831 --> 38:11.199
- You can just taste the freshness.

38:11.199 --> 38:12.068
- It's really good.

38:12.068 --> 38:13.585
- It's night and day.

38:13.585 --> 38:15.295
- [Joanna] I love this
menu, 'cause it's us.

38:15.295 --> 38:16.963
- Have we ever had dinner all together?

38:16.963 --> 38:18.673
- That really hasn't happened.

38:18.673 --> 38:19.542
- Yeah.

38:22.992 --> 38:23.861
- Coming up.

38:23.861 --> 38:25.148
Richard, you will not believe

38:25.148 --> 38:26.264
what I've done with your Butt Hut.

38:26.264 --> 38:27.922
- Oh, shit!
- Oh my God!

38:31.071 --> 38:33.813
- [Gordon] With the Davis
family ready to work together

38:34.720 --> 38:36.785
and the stunning new changes to the Lodge,

38:36.785 --> 38:38.672
I've got one more surprise for the family

38:38.672 --> 38:41.915
that will take this hotel
to a whole new level.

38:41.915 --> 38:43.323
This one you're gonna love.

38:44.491 --> 38:45.888
- [Dusty] Oh, that's so cool.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.879
- [Joanna] Oh, wow!

38:47.879 --> 38:50.695
- [Gordon] Now, this
is everything you need

38:50.695 --> 38:54.949
to put on a mini music
festival for your guests.

38:54.949 --> 38:56.318
- [Richard] Oh, wonderful!

38:56.318 --> 38:59.560
- Hell, I can't believe it. (laughs)

38:59.560 --> 39:02.728
- Now, here's the exciting news.

39:02.728 --> 39:07.097
All of a sudden, the Lodge
has four extra bedrooms.

39:07.097 --> 39:07.965
- No way.
- Oh my...

39:07.965 --> 39:09.588
- Oh, no.
- Oh my gosh.

39:09.588 --> 39:11.434
- [Joanna] Whoa.

39:11.434 --> 39:12.760
- [Dusty] Oh wow, yeah.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.135
That's too good.

39:14.135 --> 39:15.003
- Wow.

39:15.003 --> 39:17.159
- Coupled with a new outdoor grill,

39:17.159 --> 39:20.902
so the guests can enjoy a
phenomenal barbecue lunch

39:20.902 --> 39:22.466
while they enjoy the show.

39:22.466 --> 39:24.020
Now, the music business, the Lodge,

39:24.020 --> 39:26.209
the restaurant will work together.

39:26.209 --> 39:28.389
And all the elements of the
business will be making money

39:28.389 --> 39:29.692
to help pay down the debt

39:29.692 --> 39:32.278
and keep this place open
for decades to come.

39:32.278 --> 39:33.759
- I'm completely excited

39:33.759 --> 39:36.261
and ready to start doing music outdoors,

39:36.261 --> 39:37.711
and I think it's really
gonna be a great way

39:37.711 --> 39:42.340
for the Lodge and the restaurant
and the music to unite.

39:42.340 --> 39:43.435
- Wow!
- Perfect.

39:43.435 --> 39:44.968
- Now, Richard, you will not believe

39:44.968 --> 39:46.031
what I've done with your Butt Hut.

39:46.031 --> 39:47.324
Are you ready?
- Oh, shit!

39:47.324 --> 39:48.220
- Come and see it.
- Oh my God!

39:48.220 --> 39:49.089
- Come and see.

39:49.089 --> 39:51.329
I'm only joking, I haven't
touched that thing. (laughs)

39:51.329 --> 39:53.997
(all laughing)

39:53.997 --> 39:58.648
- You don't wanna go in there. (laughs)

39:58.648 --> 40:01.265
- It's time for the new and
improved Applegate Lodge

40:01.265 --> 40:02.934
to open to the public.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.758
- Pulled pork slider, yeah.

40:04.758 --> 40:06.990
- [Gordon] While Dusty and
Cami deal with the meals,

40:06.990 --> 40:09.169
Duke and Melissa handle the entertainment.

40:09.169 --> 40:10.431
With their combined effort,

40:10.431 --> 40:13.180
much needed revenue is
coming into the Lodge.

40:13.180 --> 40:15.331
And with the music on the outdoor stage,

40:15.331 --> 40:17.125
the entertainment is far enough away

40:17.125 --> 40:18.835
for guests to enjoy their rooms.

40:18.835 --> 40:21.911
- It's quiet, feels like
we're away from everything.

40:21.911 --> 40:23.996
- [Gordon] Now the the
relaunch is a success,

40:23.996 --> 40:25.936
I've got to hit the road.

40:25.936 --> 40:26.958
- Gordon!

40:26.958 --> 40:28.334
- It's time to say goodbye.

40:28.334 --> 40:29.836
- It's been a slice of heaven.

40:29.836 --> 40:32.211
A little slice of heaven.

40:32.211 --> 40:33.735
I'm serious.

40:33.735 --> 40:36.895
- But, please, do not
offer any more guests

40:36.895 --> 40:38.302
some of those special herbs.

40:38.302 --> 40:39.314
- All righty.

40:39.314 --> 40:41.191
- You built this place.
- Right.

40:41.191 --> 40:42.630
- Now let them have it.

40:42.630 --> 40:43.735
- Oh, gladly.

40:43.735 --> 40:45.497
- Take care.
- Take care out there.

40:45.497 --> 40:47.218
It's been an absolute pleasure.

40:47.218 --> 40:48.365
Yeah, bye-bye.
- Bye.

40:50.919 --> 40:52.713
Boys, my time is done.

40:52.713 --> 40:56.810
Look after each other and forget the past.

40:56.810 --> 40:57.999
Work with your brother,

40:57.999 --> 41:01.033
and take some weight off your
mother's shoulders, yeah?

41:01.033 --> 41:02.869
And this place is gonna roll.

41:02.869 --> 41:04.157
- Thank you so much, Gordon.

41:04.157 --> 41:05.288
Nice to have met you.

41:05.288 --> 41:06.570
- If Gordon didn't come,

41:06.570 --> 41:08.729
we'd be in the same stagnant environment,

41:08.729 --> 41:11.700
with no love and a lotta anger.

41:11.700 --> 41:14.265
- Those boys need to know who's boss.

41:14.265 --> 41:15.134
- They will.

41:15.134 --> 41:16.034
- Good luck, okay?

41:16.034 --> 41:17.508
- Thank you so much.

41:17.508 --> 41:20.991
There's just no words that can
express how grateful I feel

41:20.991 --> 41:23.535
for this awesome, amazing experience.

41:23.535 --> 41:24.404
- [Gordon] Good night, darling.

41:24.404 --> 41:25.272
- Bye-bye.

41:26.246 --> 41:27.438
- I'll be sad to leave this place,

41:27.438 --> 41:29.291
but I will not be sorry

41:29.291 --> 41:31.366
to see the back of Richard's Butt Hole.

41:31.366 --> 41:34.330
Butt Hut, Butt Hut. (laughs)

41:40.239 --> 41:42.231
Since my visit to the
Applegate River Lodge,

41:42.231 --> 41:44.368
Dusty and Duke continue to get along.

41:44.368 --> 41:46.172
And they're helping Joanna get income

41:46.172 --> 41:48.009
for the Lodge to reduce their debt.

41:48.009 --> 41:50.050
- If you wanna get all the
trash, I'll get all the dishes.

41:50.050 --> 41:50.919
- [Duke] Okay.

41:50.919 --> 41:52.147
- [Gordon] This family-run hotel

41:52.147 --> 41:54.775
is finally running smoothly.

41:54.775 --> 41:56.453
- I feel like this is the first step

41:56.453 --> 41:58.476
to taking the Lodge into
a destination resort,

41:58.476 --> 41:59.665
which is what it needs to be.

41:59.665 --> 42:02.605
- We should spend more time
together as a family, you know?

42:02.605 --> 42:03.492
- Yeah.

42:03.492 --> 42:06.745
- Gordon has given us an
opportunity of a lifetime,

42:06.745 --> 42:09.216
and we're not gonna let him down.

42:09.216 --> 42:12.323
- I wanna thank Gordon for
having the love in his heart

42:12.323 --> 42:16.133
to come here and put my
family back together.

42:18.507 --> 42:19.824
That's what I wanted.

42:22.369 --> 42:24.629
- Love you.
- Love you too.

42:59.388 --> 43:02.777
- One potato, two potato.
- Smoke time!
