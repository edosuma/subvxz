00:09.384 --> 00:11.376
Can I help you?

00:29.071 --> 00:30.983
- Walter Reardon.
- Who are you?

00:31.156 --> 00:33.273
Special Agent Vernon Duquesne, FBI.

00:33.450 --> 00:37.364
You're under arrest. Take everything.
Internal audits, SEC filings.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.825
Corporate minutes,
I want it all as evidence.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.706
- Evidence of what?
- Market manipulation in violation...

00:42.876 --> 00:46.586
...of U.S. code seven, section 13.
Wire fraud, money laundering.

00:46.755 --> 00:50.374
You and your lawyer have time to read
the indictment before the arraignment.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.168
His lawyer's here.
Holt Campbell, Veritable's counsel.

00:53.345 --> 00:54.756
What the hell is going on?

00:54.930 --> 00:57.468
Arrest and warrants signed
by the U.S. Duty Magistrate.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.554
- Where's the supporting affidavits?
- Sealed.

01:00.727 --> 01:05.391
Those documents contain trade secrets
we spent millions to acquire and protect.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.559
Call Judge Curtis Chambers,
get his clerk on the line.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.852
This is Holt Campbell
with Veritable Robotics.

01:11.029 --> 01:14.989
Your boss signed warrants to search
our offices and arrest our CFO.

01:15.158 --> 01:19.368
Really? Well, if he didn't sign them,
why am I holding the paperwork?

01:24.751 --> 01:26.617
Walter?

01:26.795 --> 01:30.664
- Walter?
- Call the FBI. The real FBI.

01:30.841 --> 01:34.300
- What happened?
- Nothing. They left everything behind.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.802
I wanna know why.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.531
- What are you doing?
- She's shivering.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.196
- She's supposed to be cold.
- I know. I read up on TTM.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.161
How you circulate cold saline
through her femoral artery.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.543
Her core body temperature
was only 91 degrees.

02:08.711 --> 02:12.581
She suffered a cerebral ischemia.
Cooling her protects her brain.

02:12.758 --> 02:15.341
Right, by decreasing
the brain's demand for oxygen...

02:15.510 --> 02:17.843
...you reduce neurotransmitter production.

02:18.013 --> 02:21.927
- Someone's been reading Wikipedia.
- I read the page and footnotes.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.468
Ninety-one degrees was
an AHA guideline in 2010, but...

02:25.646 --> 02:28.184
...in 2015,
the journal <i>Resuscitation</i> concluded...

02:28.357 --> 02:32.067
- ...that 97 degrees was more effective.
- I'm just following protocol.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.648
Are you her husband?
Part of her medical directive?

02:34.821 --> 02:36.608
I'm her fiancÃ©.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.734
- I proposed while she was unconscious.
- Do you have power of attorney?

02:40.911 --> 02:44.075
- No, but...
- I'm gonna have to ask you to step aside.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.795
- I'm ashamed of this.
- You shouldn't be.

02:52.964 --> 02:57.129
Samar's in the hospital fighting for her life.
Instead of being there for her and Aram...

02:57.302 --> 02:59.589
...I'm trying to find this bag
before Reddington.

02:59.763 --> 03:03.757
Agent Navabi needs our prayers.
We don't need to be at the hospital.

03:04.142 --> 03:07.306
As for the duffel, Tom died
trying to find out what it contains.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.812
Your determination to find it
makes perfect sense.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.893
We're happy to help, so talk to me.

03:12.859 --> 03:16.648
Before he died,
Garvey went to Costa Rica.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.656
To give the bag
to a man named Max Birmingham.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.192
- What do you know about the man?
- For starters...

03:23.370 --> 03:25.236
...his name isn't Max Birmingham.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.906
The man we're looking for is Sutton Ross.

03:28.083 --> 03:31.042
In the '80s, if a company
or country wanted to steal R and D...

03:31.211 --> 03:33.919
...rather than develop it,
Ross and his team stole it.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.422
Didn't he steal it
on a stealth fighter for China?

03:36.591 --> 03:38.958
A defective fighter called
the Grayscape 17.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.594
The Navy knew
Ross was working for China...

03:41.763 --> 03:44.972
...so they made sure he stole plans
for a plane that couldn't fly.

03:45.142 --> 03:48.431
When it crashed, China blamed Ross,
turned him over to the feds...

03:48.603 --> 03:50.811
...who issued a warrant,
and Ross disappeared.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.769
Until showing up in Costa Rica
under Max Birmingham.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.729
Why would Garvey give him the bag?

03:55.902 --> 03:57.609
Because when Ross went AWOL...

03:57.779 --> 04:00.192
...Garvey was the marshal assigned
to arrest him.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.233
Instead of bringing him in,
Garvey protected him.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.653
These two haven't met in weeks.
Any idea where Ross is now?

04:06.830 --> 04:08.662
Yes, doing business as usual.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.791
Ross and a dozen suspects posing
as FBI agents...

04:11.960 --> 04:15.795
...showed up to a robotics company,
waving phony warrants.

04:15.964 --> 04:19.253
The guy with Reddington's secret is
stealing from a robotics company?

04:19.426 --> 04:24.888
Yes and no. The police report says
he stole it and then left it all behind.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.639
Nobody robs a company for kicks.
Get there.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.472
If we find what we was after,
we'll find him and the bag.

04:30.645 --> 04:31.726
Before Reddington.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.312
What a lovely shop.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.853
You certainly look busy as a beaver.

04:40.030 --> 04:43.489
- I'm with a client.
- Yes, and I'm sorry for the intrusion.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.321
I need a moment of your time
about a customer.

04:46.495 --> 04:49.863
Were we doing side tabs
or traditional belt loops?

04:50.040 --> 04:53.033
Go for the side tabs,
they keep you honest in the midsection.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.419
I'm sorry, sir,
but we are in the middle of a fitting.

04:56.588 --> 04:58.750
Yes, I understand.

05:01.092 --> 05:06.178
Oh, my God. You're...
Oh, dear. I am such a fan.

05:06.348 --> 05:09.386
- Thank you.
- Your films, your writing, your artwork.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.926
Do you get all your suits done here?

05:12.103 --> 05:14.937
- We are very busy.
- You probably get this all the time...

05:15.106 --> 05:17.940
...but I must tell you, I absolutely adore...

05:18.109 --> 05:20.897
<i>- Pink Flamingos?</i>
- Yes, but your Christmas show.

05:21.071 --> 05:24.485
I had tickets in Baltimore,
and I was running so late...

05:24.658 --> 05:28.197
...I only saw the last 20 or 30 minutes,
but I have to tell you...

05:28.370 --> 05:32.080
...it was one
of the most surprisingly warm...

05:32.249 --> 05:34.161
...incredibly nostalgic...

05:34.334 --> 05:38.419
- ...funny evenings in my memory.
- Well, look at you, what a sweet man.

05:38.588 --> 05:42.207
That story about the squirrel,
the one with the tiny nuts.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.795
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:43.969 --> 05:47.508
You look awfully comfy,
what kind of fabric is that?

05:47.681 --> 05:52.551
A lightweight Merino.
Super 120, natural stretch, I swear by it.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.059
Marty, can you do...

05:54.229 --> 05:57.347
...that same multicolored puppytooth
in that collection?

05:57.524 --> 06:00.483
- Is that British?
- I'll tell you if you tell me.

06:00.652 --> 06:03.360
Your client, Sutton Ross.

06:03.530 --> 06:07.069
I've fallen out of touch with him,
but I do need to find him.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.403
Right away.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.909
Every document taken
from Reardon's office was returned.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.290
They targeted Reardon
to get into the office.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.076
Not just the office, this very corridor.

06:19.254 --> 06:23.794
Walter's office is across the hall from one
of our research specialists, Ravi Desai.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.504
Three hard drives are missing.

06:26.678 --> 06:30.297
They contain Ravi's research
on something called the Rafferty Project.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.180
Have you spoken to Mr. Desai?

06:32.350 --> 06:35.434
We haven't been able to reach him.
His kids are off from school.

06:35.604 --> 06:36.845
He took vacation time.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.184
The Rafferty Project,
what can you tell us?

06:39.357 --> 06:43.772
Nothing. It was his personal project. He'd
be the only one that could speak about it.

06:43.945 --> 06:47.188
All right, we'll need access
to your backup servers.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.981
<i>First, I want to thank you.</i>

06:49.159 --> 06:53.073
- Thank us? We feel awful for imposing.
- No, not at all. You distracted me.

06:53.246 --> 06:57.240
Right now, that is exactly what I need.
The doctors too.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.910
- Keeps me from telling them what to do.
- You're telling them what to do?

07:01.087 --> 07:03.170
<i>When I think
what they're doing is wrong.</i>

07:03.340 --> 07:08.131
So, like, all the time. Except now.
Right now, I'm thinking about Ravi Desai.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.260
- You've heard of him?
<i>- Are you kidding?</i>

07:10.430 --> 07:14.174
I've been a fan since he won the IEEE
Robotics and Automation Award...

07:14.351 --> 07:15.933
...as a PhD student at Brown.

07:16.102 --> 07:20.722
<i>- I follow him on Instagram, Twitter...</i>
- You know what the Rafferty Project is?

07:20.899 --> 07:24.813
Well, the backup files indicate
that it's some kind of exoskeleton.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.024
A manned robot designed
to help people go into hazardous areas.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.736
That's an idea
that Ross could sell for a fortune.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.447
<i>Maybe. But the idea is all he'd be selling.</i>

07:33.620 --> 07:35.612
<i>Whoever buys the drives can't build one.</i>

07:35.789 --> 07:38.202
- Why not?
- The files are all snippets of ideas...

07:38.375 --> 07:41.334
...and partial equations.
Desai could build a robot from them.

07:41.503 --> 07:44.996
But no one else could
without him to explain what they mean.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.506
We need to get to Desai
before Ross grabs him.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.668
<i>He's at a matinee with his kids.</i>

07:49.844 --> 07:53.679
- How do you know that?
<i>- Like I said, I follow him on Instagram.</i>

07:53.848 --> 07:57.717
<i>And he just posted a picture with them
on his way to a show...</i>

07:57.894 --> 08:00.261
<i>...at The Kittredge Theater.</i>

08:00.438 --> 08:01.895
I want all three.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.058
- The kids too?
- Insurance...

08:05.235 --> 08:08.945
...in case Mr. Desai is not
in the mood to cooperate.

08:14.786 --> 08:18.655
- I've never seen him before.
- Mr. Lungrin, take a closer look.

08:18.832 --> 08:23.372
The suit he's wearing has your label
stitched into the lining of the jacket.

08:23.545 --> 08:27.789
Please, Mr. Ross is very powerful.

08:27.966 --> 08:31.630
If I tell you how to find him,
if he knew that I told you...

08:31.803 --> 08:34.044
...he would come for me.

08:34.222 --> 08:38.057
No matter how powerful
you think Sutton Ross might be...

08:38.226 --> 08:41.845
- ...if you don't help me...
- My God, that's it! You're the guy!

08:42.022 --> 08:43.479
The one with the name.

08:43.648 --> 08:49.064
It's not a palindrome or a rhyme.
It's that last name with the alliteration.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.354
- It's...
- No, don't say it.

08:51.531 --> 08:56.447
It's Paddington. Or Rattington.
Or Raphael. Or Rayburn.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.656
Or Rufus... Rufus Reddington!

08:58.830 --> 09:00.571
You're Raymond Reddington?

09:00.749 --> 09:03.366
Yes! Raymond Reddington,
I told you not to say it.

09:03.543 --> 09:08.538
Raymond Reddington, wow,
what a name. What a man.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.672
And people think I'm weird?

09:11.843 --> 09:16.178
Please, all I know is where I send
the invoices for my work.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.838
Well...

09:18.266 --> 09:19.757
Right.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.261
So, what do you think of this one?

09:24.147 --> 09:25.979
Oh, John, yes, I like that.

09:26.149 --> 09:29.358
But go with the Snowy River collection...

09:29.527 --> 09:31.484
...in the glenurquhart plaid.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.691
It worked for the Duke of Windsor.

09:33.865 --> 09:36.699
And just my opinion, consider a vest.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.825
You think? Are vests in again?

09:38.995 --> 09:42.113
- Vests have never been out.
- Okay.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.575
My invoice, for Sutton.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.873
This is the address where I send them.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.840
Good afternoon, Mr. Jordan.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.798
- Who are you?
- My name is Raymond Reddington.

09:56.971 --> 10:00.510
I don't have time
to explain all that that implies.

10:00.683 --> 10:04.302
Suffice it to say, I know
you handle accounts for Sutton Ross.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.266
You're gonna help me find him.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.149
<i>All wrong, never get anywhere.</i>

10:11.319 --> 10:14.403
<i>- Poor things.
- Yeah, but that old thumb never fails.</i>

10:14.572 --> 10:17.986
<i>- Smile goes with this one, like this.
- You figured that out by yourself?</i>

10:18.159 --> 10:22.073
There's a sniper in the balcony
ready to execute your children.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.658
If you want them to live,
you need to leave with me now.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.790
I'll be right back.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.132
You secure the entrance,
I'll get in touch with security.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.427
That SUV, 3 o'clock.
He's one of Ross's men.

10:46.604 --> 10:50.644
- I recognize him from the surveillance.
- All right, I'll cover you.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.028
Give me the keys.

11:02.579 --> 11:03.740
Get out of the car.

11:09.794 --> 11:10.830
Keen.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.124
Get in the back.

11:18.386 --> 11:21.220
Hey, kids. Your dad needs you
to come with me.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.851
New plan. Vehicles at the rear.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.979
Cover me. Someone's on my tail.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.614
Keen, they're coming your way.
Got a black SUV.

11:58.343 --> 12:01.131
- Where's Elizabeth?
- She's just ahead of you.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.812
Please, my children.

12:11.981 --> 12:15.440
Tell me what I need to know
and your children will be fine.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.782
- What?!
- Leave Ross to me.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.572
- Is that a threat?
- Advice.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.332
Soon as I get the duffel, he's all yours.

12:38.800 --> 12:39.961
Pull over.

12:40.134 --> 12:44.003
You're a fugitive, I'm a cop.
Get in my way, I'll arrest you.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.235
- Turn around.
- We'll lose Ross.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.987
Dembe, turn around.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.032
Let me look at you, come here.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.871
Raymond Reddington,
you're under arrest.

13:12.041 --> 13:14.784
It's a deep cut. You'll need stitches.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.544
You have the right to an attorney.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.422
- Here.
- You have the right to remain silent.

13:20.591 --> 13:24.084
Anything you say will be used
against you in a court of law.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.674
Keep pressure on it.

13:26.848 --> 13:29.682
- I'll call you an ambulance.
- I'll get you for this.

13:30.351 --> 13:33.560
You'll try, but there's a fine line
between fishing...

13:33.730 --> 13:36.894
...and standing on the shore,
looking like an idiot.

13:43.114 --> 13:46.778
- So you arrested Reddington?
- I was too dazed to arrest him.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.409
He let Ross go to make sure I was okay.

13:49.579 --> 13:52.071
Hit me, hug me.
Reddington's moral code in a nutshell.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.831
Ross got away
and Reddington has his driver.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.244
Reddington shot a couple
of Ross's guys. We got a cell phone...

13:58.421 --> 14:00.538
<i>...but it's locked,
we need the access code.</i>

14:00.715 --> 14:02.331
Maybe there's another way.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.347
It's a burner.
No e-mails, call logs or contacts.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.640
Just one text sent
to an international number.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.558
"Winchester. 1500. AM."

14:21.736 --> 14:23.978
Fifteen-hundred is p.m., so it's not a time.

14:24.155 --> 14:28.399
And if it's a place,
there is a 1500 Winchester in 20 states.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.533
- Aram, how is she?
- The same.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.286
At least she was
when her doctors kicked me out.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.914
- Keen, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:36.084 --> 14:39.248
And Samar will be too,
if you stop telling the doctors what to do.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.537
Look, all you can do is wait now.

14:41.714 --> 14:46.800
I know, which is why I'm here.
I meant it, work is a distraction, so please.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.882
- Say you have some for me.
- As a matter of fact, we do.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.634
I know you work for Ross!
Hey, look at me!

14:54.811 --> 14:56.473
The truth always comes out.

14:56.646 --> 14:59.059
It better or we won't find Sutton Ross.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.350
I'm talking about your truth.
It was bound to surface.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.564
Ross wants blood. You ruined his life.

15:04.737 --> 15:08.276
I didn't give Sutton Ross bogus plans
for the Grayscape 17.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.816
He thinks you did.
And because of that...

15:10.993 --> 15:14.202
...he wants the world to know
what's inside the duffel.

15:17.750 --> 15:22.085
This guy's lips are sealed tighter
than a bull's ass in fly season.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.623
I'll need another couple of bags
of hickory briquettes...

15:25.800 --> 15:27.507
...and a squirt gun.

15:31.222 --> 15:33.839
I know who hired Ross
to abduct Ravi Desai...

15:34.016 --> 15:36.679
...and where and when
Ross will be handing him over.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.345
- You know that from the texts?
- And number.

15:39.522 --> 15:42.981
The message was sent to a cell
with an international number.

15:43.151 --> 15:47.771
011 is the U.S. exit code,
and 381 is the country code for Serbia.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.860
- So?
- So after Ravi Desai got his PhD...

15:51.033 --> 15:53.241
...two robotics companies wanted
to hire him.

15:53.411 --> 15:56.495
One was Veritable.
The other, AXG Robotics.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.246
A Serbian company.

15:58.416 --> 16:02.330
Homeland says two of their execs
landed in Dulles this morning.

16:02.503 --> 16:06.918
How does that get you the where
and when Ross is giving them Desai?

16:07.091 --> 16:12.052
It doesn't, but the message does.
AM isn't a time. It's a place.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.964
A neighborhood in D.C. Adams Morgan.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.600
In Adams Morgan is the old
Winchester Pharmaceutical Plant.

16:18.769 --> 16:21.261
So 1500 is the time, 3 p.m.

16:21.439 --> 16:24.227
Did the Serbians list the hotel
where they're staying?

16:24.400 --> 16:25.857
The Metro Suites. Why?

16:26.027 --> 16:30.021
This mess started with criminals
pretending to be FBI agents.

16:30.198 --> 16:32.611
Maybe we should return the favor.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.654
- It's done.
- Did he talk?

16:38.831 --> 16:43.041
Like Whoopi on <i>The View.</i>
Yakety-yak all about the Rafferty Project.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.043
- The duffel bag?
- Never heard of it.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.000
- What about Ross?
- Meeting a client...

16:47.173 --> 16:51.087
...at the old Winchester
Pharmaceutical Plant at 3.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.003
- What is the Rafferty Project?
- I don't know.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.054
But I know what it means.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.341
Ross is on to the next job.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.555
That duffel may already be gone.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.905
Brimley said he knew nothing
about the duffel.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.157
I'll call the twins in for cleanup.

17:16.327 --> 17:19.444
You alert Morgan.
I want him on site at the plant.

17:28.923 --> 17:32.166
We got eyes
from about 200 yards southwest.

17:32.343 --> 17:33.459
We're in position.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.302
I want Ross and his hostage.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.342
Ready on your signal.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.732
The drives were useless without
the engineer who programmed them.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.192
Getting him doubles the price.

17:55.366 --> 17:58.074
Of course, I can only deliver
the actual mind.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.736
Accessing what's inside it is your job.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.156
Wait, hold, hold, hold.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.122
Please, I'm begging you.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.628
Let my children go.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.049
Stand down. Abort.

18:15.219 --> 18:18.758
Don't stop. Just keep walking.
Everything's gonna be fine.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.220
When that door opens,
you get in and you stay down.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.180
Get on the ground! FBI!

18:25.354 --> 18:26.640
Hands on your head!

18:26.814 --> 18:28.646
On the ground now.

18:50.504 --> 18:54.498
Kidnapping, impersonating an officer,
theft of trade secrets.

18:54.675 --> 18:59.215
That's before we talk about the plans
for a stealth fighter you sold to China.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.096
Last I checked,
we execute people for treason.

19:02.266 --> 19:05.680
- Ian Garvey gave you a duffel bag.
- I know who you are.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.812
- The bag, where is it?
- You're Elizabeth Keen.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.065
- You help us, we'll help you.
- Oh, you'll help me.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.942
- And I have demands.
- We're listening.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.024
- Tell the Serbian to take a walk.
- Forget it.

19:17.198 --> 19:20.532
And no cameras. No audio recordings.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.488
Just you and me.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.997
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I've looked in the bag.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.037
- Five minutes.
- Liz.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.247
I'll be fine.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.878
Five minutes, not a second more.

19:46.811 --> 19:50.896
- So?
- You may want to sit, Agent Keen.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.441
- I want Ross.
- I know. I'm not giving him to you.

19:54.610 --> 19:58.980
A clever ruse, detaining the Serbians,
inserting Ressler in their place.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.899
- I'm on Elizabeth's side on this.
- Clearly.

20:02.076 --> 20:06.696
So allow me to put a fine point
on the cost of that decision.

20:07.331 --> 20:10.290
The duffel bag is mine.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.997
Its contents are personal.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.753
I want my privacy respected.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.711
You and Agent Keen are not
honoring that...

20:18.884 --> 20:22.048
...so I see no reason
to honor our agreement.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.929
- What agreement?
- Mine with the task force.

20:25.099 --> 20:27.056
It's a simple ultimatum.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.434
I get Ross...

20:29.603 --> 20:31.970
...or the Blacklist ends.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.978
- You wanna force my hand?
- I told you what I want.

20:36.152 --> 20:39.771
I told you that you can't have him,
ultimatum or no ultimatum.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.909
Ressler!

20:53.753 --> 20:58.714
Level-four breach, east Interrogation.
We need emergency systems now.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.843
Stay here.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.970
- What happened?
- Ross has Keen.

21:09.143 --> 21:13.604
- Door's locked. He took out our view.
- I can override the CCTV's power.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.561
Contact HRT.
Get an emergency response team.

21:17.026 --> 21:20.610
- Cooper.
- Okay, we are officially in full lockdown.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.942
It's him. Calling on Keen's cell.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.107
<i>Okay, here's how this works.</i>

21:25.284 --> 21:29.028
<i>Do as I say or Agent Keen dies.</i>

21:29.705 --> 21:31.196
<i>Don't listen to him.</i>

21:31.373 --> 21:33.911
<i>- If you breach from the observation...
- Shut up.</i>

21:34.084 --> 21:39.546
<i>I like the spirit. But understand I have
no problem making good on my threat.</i>

21:39.715 --> 21:42.833
You're locked in. You're in no position
to make demands.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.218
<i>Yet I am confident
you will meet them.</i>

21:45.387 --> 21:48.300
<i>I want two CZ 75s
and a police caravan...</i>

21:48.474 --> 21:52.468
<i>...to escort me and Agent Keen
in 15 minutes.</i>

21:53.103 --> 21:57.188
- Escort you where?
<i>- That's the fun part. Wait to find out.</i>

21:57.691 --> 22:00.024
You need to breach that room right now.

22:00.194 --> 22:03.107
HRT is trying to make contact
with Keen's cell.

22:03.280 --> 22:07.650
"Trying" is the word. He's not gonna
make contact. He's not negotiating.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.285
- What do you suggest?
- Cut the power, blow the doors.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.696
Stun grenades, CS gas and extract.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.160
How can you be sure
he doesn't kill Keen?

22:15.334 --> 22:18.042
Can't. It's a calculated risk.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.175
<i>Demands were a ruse.
They're in the plenum cavity.</i>

22:33.352 --> 22:38.222
Searching security feeds. No sign
of anyone in corridors L2, 3 or 5.

22:38.399 --> 22:39.731
They're still overhead.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.483
Guys, I got something.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.612
Man down.
Sidearm and badge are missing.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.321
So Ross is now armed.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.578
<i>- Last name Schay.</i>
- "Schay." Come on.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.160
Okay. Schay, Charlie. Interim security.

22:56.333 --> 22:59.576
His badge was swiped
two minutes ago at door 32C.

22:59.753 --> 23:02.712
- South wing, first floor.
- On my way.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.418
Move, move.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.470
<i>That's far enough.</i>

23:10.639 --> 23:13.848
That badge belongs to interim security.
You need a passcode.

23:14.018 --> 23:15.850
<i>Then give me one.</i>

23:17.062 --> 23:19.520
- You can't.
<i>- Don't think I'll shoot her?</i>

23:19.690 --> 23:23.058
- Give me a code! Now!
- Don't listen to him. He's bluffing.

23:23.736 --> 23:27.821
- She's right. He's bluffing.
- Maybe. If you're wrong, Keen's dead.

23:29.283 --> 23:33.527
I'm not gonna open that door. I have men
on the way to you. Stand down.

23:33.704 --> 23:35.661
<i>- Three.</i>
- I'm not wrong.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.823
- He's bluffing.
- You don't know.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.333
<i>- Two.</i>
- If you give him that code...

23:40.502 --> 23:42.710
...it's unlikely you'll see Keen again.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.247
<i>- One!</i>
- Eight, three, seven, two, four.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.916
Eight, three, seven, two, four.
That's the code.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.659
BOLO's out with IDs
and a description of the vehicle.

24:14.828 --> 24:18.162
The car's a dead end.
He's ditched it and stolen another.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.324
I'm sorry. He was gonna shoot her.

24:20.501 --> 24:24.666
Agent Mojtabai is not the reason
she's in danger. You are.

24:24.838 --> 24:28.878
If you're interested in her safety,
stay away from her.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.304
- Agent Keen.
- On speaker.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.681
Yeah.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.642
- Elizabeth.
- Your life for hers.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.558
- Done.
- There's a pay phone at 3rd and Summit.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.518
Let me speak with her.

24:44.692 --> 24:47.935
Be there in an hour
to receive instructions. Come alone.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.024
I wanna talk to her.

24:50.531 --> 24:54.150
- You're not going alone.
- That's exactly what I'm going to do.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.490
What I'm going to do is blanket
that meeting with surveillance.

24:57.663 --> 25:01.623
- We're not letting you out of sight.
- Now who's putting her life in danger?

25:06.213 --> 25:08.079
Heads up, people. Here we go.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.467
- Team Bravo, you have eyes?
- Copy. On your go.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.716
- Charlie, you in place?
- Affirmative.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.425
<i>- Aram?</i>
- I'm up on the phone.

25:17.599 --> 25:20.262
As soon as I get a hard trace,
I'll call it in.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.599
<i>Top 10 is on the move.</i>

25:41.915 --> 25:43.747
- Yeah.
<i>- Mr. Reddington.</i>

25:43.917 --> 25:45.909
<i>Is that a tail I see watching you?</i>

25:48.922 --> 25:50.333
You getting this?

25:50.507 --> 25:52.339
I've got the pay phone tapped,
not the burner.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.967
I have no way to access that line.

25:57.598 --> 26:01.683
You knew I couldn't get here
without the feds keeping a close watch.

26:01.852 --> 26:04.640
They're rather protective of Agent Keen.

26:04.813 --> 26:10.730
But if you're half as smart as you think
you are, I'm sure you have a plan.

26:16.617 --> 26:19.826
- Where the hell is he going?
- Pulling CCTV feeds now.

26:24.458 --> 26:27.622
- Raymond is letting them take him.
- "Letting"?

26:27.795 --> 26:29.002
For Elizabeth.

26:33.342 --> 26:36.835
- What are you doing?
- I'm pulling up additional CCTV feeds.

26:37.012 --> 26:39.299
A view of the rear entrance
of the lumber yard.

26:52.194 --> 26:55.938
I've got him. They're loading him
into a white, late-model van.

26:56.115 --> 26:59.153
Okay, we move on my go, all units.

27:00.410 --> 27:03.027
Okay. Target van is headed south
on Central.

27:03.205 --> 27:06.619
<i>Bravo and Charlie, move in.
Take them from the south approach.</i>

27:06.792 --> 27:09.284
Hang on a second. We've got a situation.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.828
- I've got another van.
- "Another"?

27:12.005 --> 27:15.919
I've got two more vans and two more
UNSUBs being loaded now...

27:16.093 --> 27:17.800
...and on the move.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.383
Make that north on Central
and south on Central.

27:21.557 --> 27:25.551
Okay, move in. All units, go now.
Aram, you need to track those vans.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.810
<i>Yup. Already on it.</i>

27:27.980 --> 27:32.395
Okay, Team Bravo,
your van is moving west on Bryant.

27:34.027 --> 27:39.364
<i>Okay, Charlie, you can intercept
three blocks north on Gerard.</i>

27:42.327 --> 27:44.410
<i>Tell M.P.D. we need a perimeter...</i>

27:44.580 --> 27:47.744
...from Franklin Street NE south
to New York Ave.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.556
Bravo and Charlie intercepted two vans...

28:13.734 --> 28:17.603
<i>- ...and you are right behind the third.</i>
- All right, take them.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.366
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- The van.

28:25.078 --> 28:27.365
- Which one? We've got all three.
<i>- No.</i>

28:27.539 --> 28:30.907
The gray liquor van.
The one that left through the street.

28:31.084 --> 28:33.167
It's how Raymond was taken.

28:33.337 --> 28:34.919
This is all a distraction?

29:10.332 --> 29:12.289
What the hell happened?

29:12.459 --> 29:16.419
Ross had it gamed out. Reddington
wasn't much help. He surrendered.

29:16.588 --> 29:20.002
Get M.P.D. the last known location.
Have them set a perimeter.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.711
What about the dead zones?

29:21.885 --> 29:25.629
We have to canvass it
the old-fashioned way, door to door.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.645
This is my fault.

29:34.815 --> 29:37.558
- No.
- I should have just let it go.

29:37.734 --> 29:38.895
Does it matter?

29:40.237 --> 29:42.980
Mr. Kaplan, Tom...

29:43.532 --> 29:46.240
We all should have just left it alone.

29:47.411 --> 29:51.405
They didn't because they thought
I deserved to know, but I don't.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.327
Whatever this is, it's yours.

29:58.588 --> 30:01.331
I should've respected that.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.592
The only reason we're here is
because I didn't.

30:05.762 --> 30:08.425
- I'm so...
- You have nothing to apologize for.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.715
Not to me, ever.

30:16.273 --> 30:19.266
My life for hers.
That was the agreement.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.736
Let her go.

30:24.197 --> 30:26.189
Take her in the back.

30:26.366 --> 30:29.609
No, no, no.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.995
You don't need to hurt her anymore.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.578
Whether or not she suffers is
entirely up to you.

30:36.752 --> 30:39.039
I should say, "How much she suffers."

30:39.212 --> 30:42.171
I should warn you,
my men are somewhat indelicate.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.505
So the quicker you tell me
what I want to know...

30:45.677 --> 30:48.294
...the less damage they will do to her.

30:48.472 --> 30:51.089
Let's start with this DNA report.

30:51.266 --> 30:54.805
The search area has
over 500 businesses, 64 blocks.

30:54.978 --> 30:59.598
Even with M.P.D. assisting,
it's gotta be at least one minute per block.

30:59.775 --> 31:01.937
- We'll never find them.
- We will.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.772
How can you be so sure?

31:03.945 --> 31:06.733
God only gives you burdens
you can carry.

31:06.907 --> 31:10.901
Losing Raymond and Elizabeth?
I couldn't carry that.

31:11.078 --> 31:15.288
- I feel the same about Samar too.
- Then you have nothing to worry about.

31:16.333 --> 31:20.703
For 30 years, I've wanted to be in
the same room as Raymond Reddington.

31:20.879 --> 31:24.714
The bastard who tricked me
into selling the Chinese a dodo bird...

31:24.883 --> 31:27.250
...when they were looking for an eagle.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.009
And here we are.

31:31.515 --> 31:34.132
So the DNA report.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.925
Tell me what it means.

31:38.438 --> 31:41.806
There. On the left. That's the van.

31:43.318 --> 31:47.028
Okay, Delaware plate, 8LV235.
Running it now.

31:47.197 --> 31:50.281
We found it, 424 North Roslyn.

31:50.450 --> 31:51.691
424 North Roslyn.

31:51.868 --> 31:54.736
- We're eight blocks away.
- Two minutes out.

31:54.913 --> 31:58.532
If I tell, what guarantee do I have
that you'll let her go?

31:58.708 --> 32:02.702
The only guarantee you have is
if you don't tell me, she will die.

32:03.213 --> 32:05.956
Of course,
perhaps you don't care about that.

32:06.133 --> 32:11.379
Perhaps her life isn't worth
your revealing your precious secret for.

32:11.555 --> 32:15.299
After all, what is she to you really?

32:17.060 --> 32:18.676
Enough.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.479
Tell me the truth.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.273
The truth.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.809
The truth...

32:25.986 --> 32:28.103
...is that I am not...

32:30.323 --> 32:33.191
- On the ground! FBI.
- Raymond, are you okay?

32:33.368 --> 32:37.703
Yeah. They're more of them
in the back. They have Elizabeth.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.544
Elizabeth.

32:54.097 --> 32:55.133
It's over.

32:58.018 --> 33:00.601
- SWAT is on the way. You can't be here.
- Raymond.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.306
I got her. Go.

33:06.943 --> 33:09.811
I've advised you of your rights.
Do you understand them?

33:09.988 --> 33:11.729
Yes, I do.

33:14.242 --> 33:18.077
You can play all the magic tricks you like.
I know the truth.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.813
Oh, my God.

33:49.986 --> 33:52.228
I... I have to go.

33:52.405 --> 33:53.987
I have to go.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.608
I didn't know if...

34:40.036 --> 34:42.494
When you didn't wake up, I thought...

34:45.625 --> 34:48.163
- I don't know what I thought.
- Yes.

34:49.129 --> 34:52.088
- What?
- I said, yes.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.373
Yes what?

34:54.926 --> 34:57.134
Yes, I will marry you.

35:04.311 --> 35:07.600
<i>The whole thing ended
just like it always does.</i>

35:07.772 --> 35:10.389
<i>With the bad guy dead on the floor.</i>

35:10.567 --> 35:13.526
<i>With the bureau confused and upset...</i>

35:13.695 --> 35:17.188
<i>...but satisfied another scumbag's
wiped from the earth.</i>

35:17.365 --> 35:18.822
<i>With Reddington gone.</i>

35:19.534 --> 35:24.620
<i>His precious duffel bag still a secret,
like he wanted all along.</i>

35:26.249 --> 35:27.911
<i>Except it's not a secret.</i>

35:29.294 --> 35:31.160
<i>Not to me.</i>

35:32.297 --> 35:35.256
Because this time I have a secret too.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.046
I learned that from you.

35:38.595 --> 35:42.339
How to prey on the emotions
of those that love you most.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.256
And it worked?

35:48.271 --> 35:50.137
Like a charm.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.477
How'd you do it?

35:52.651 --> 35:54.859
I told a few lies.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.270
God, I miss you.

36:00.075 --> 36:01.532
Well, go on.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.736
I'm dying to hear how you pulled this off.

36:06.331 --> 36:09.369
I was with Ross. He told me.

36:09.542 --> 36:12.501
And that's the truth. And I can prove it.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.539
- But it can't be.
- But it is.

36:15.715 --> 36:20.506
I have the bag, the bones
and the DNA report.

36:20.679 --> 36:23.592
Get me out of here
and I can show it to you.

36:25.475 --> 36:27.057
Okay.

36:27.227 --> 36:29.514
Here's what I need you to do.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.649
Ressler!

36:39.614 --> 36:44.029
Level-four breach, east Interrogation.
We need emergency systems now.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.536
I made a few demands
to buy us enough time to get out.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.699
Aram will have those feeds up
any minute. Listen.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.207
Make a demand.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.413
A few theatrics.

36:53.586 --> 36:54.952
<i>Don't listen to him.</i>

36:55.130 --> 36:58.714
<i>- If you breach from the observation...
- Shut up.</i>

37:05.515 --> 37:07.882
Demands were a ruse.
They're in the plenum cavity.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.301
Once out, Ross took you to the bones?

37:10.478 --> 37:12.140
Not just Ross.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.724
He had help.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.857
Garvey didn't reach out to me
because I hate Reddington.

37:17.026 --> 37:21.145
He wanted me to help get the truth
to the person he cares about most.

37:22.866 --> 37:24.073
You.

37:25.869 --> 37:27.110
Of course it's you.

37:27.287 --> 37:31.622
Garvey gave me the bag in Costa Rica,
so I could get it to your sister.

37:31.791 --> 37:34.078
- Did he tell you?
- Yes.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.289
He said there's proof.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.598
Yeah, the DNA test.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.976
<i>- It was in the bag. I saw it.
- Yes.</i>

37:52.145 --> 37:57.265
You and I can get the truth. If this is
gonna work, we need Reddington's trust.

37:58.568 --> 38:00.730
I can help with that.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.149
- Your life for hers.
<i>- Done.</i>

38:03.323 --> 38:05.189
There's a pay phone at 3rd and Summit.

38:05.366 --> 38:08.074
<i>Be there in an hour
to receive instructions.</i>

38:08.244 --> 38:10.406
<i>- Come alone.</i>
- I wanna talk to her.

38:21.049 --> 38:22.585
- Again.
- That's enough.

38:23.593 --> 38:27.132
If you're gonna tell him you hurt me,
he's gotta believe you.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.463
Again.

38:32.769 --> 38:37.184
You knew Reddington would come
for you. Anything for you.

38:38.942 --> 38:40.478
Let her go.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.439
Take her in the back.

38:42.779 --> 38:43.986
No, no, no.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.693
No, no, no. No!

38:46.866 --> 38:51.531
Perhaps her life isn't worth your revealing
your precious secret for.

39:05.385 --> 39:09.174
- He's not talking.
- He will. You have to keep pushing.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.634
Tell him you're gonna kill me.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.343
While it didn't work like I planned...

39:15.520 --> 39:17.056
...it worked even better.

39:18.189 --> 39:23.230
I got to the truth that you and so many
people have died trying to expose.

39:23.403 --> 39:26.487
I know the truth, Red...

39:26.656 --> 39:27.988
...about that night.

39:29.576 --> 39:32.034
- I have to tell her.
- I can't let you do that.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.569
She deserves the truth.

39:35.331 --> 39:37.414
He's not who you think he is.

39:38.751 --> 39:42.540
I have it. I went there and dug it up.
I'm gonna give it to her.

39:43.548 --> 39:47.007
I figured it out, the whole thing.
Why Nik was killed, all of it.

39:47.176 --> 39:49.213
No!

39:54.017 --> 39:56.509
Reddington nearly found out
about Jennifer.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.136
I think he would've killed her too.

40:01.858 --> 40:04.601
Go now! Go!

40:04.777 --> 40:08.020
<i>But instead, he got to do
what he always does.</i>

40:08.197 --> 40:10.154
<i>Try and save me.</i>

40:12.702 --> 40:14.443
Elizabeth.

40:15.038 --> 40:16.574
It's over.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.038
And bury his secret.

40:32.013 --> 40:36.132
She may not know your secret,
but she knows you've got one.

40:36.309 --> 40:38.346
She's never gonna let it go.

40:38.519 --> 40:40.306
So now you know.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.769
- Why he was willing to let people die...
- Let you die.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.150
- ...to hide the truth.
- I know now...

40:46.778 --> 40:49.270
<i>...that those bones in that bag...</i>

40:50.865 --> 40:53.107
...are Raymond Reddington's.

40:54.243 --> 40:57.031
<i>The real Raymond Reddington.</i>

41:01.918 --> 41:03.534
My father.

41:04.212 --> 41:07.580
<i>I know that this man is an imposter.</i>

41:07.757 --> 41:11.546
<i>Why he came into my life,
why he took your life...</i>

41:11.719 --> 41:15.929
<i>...why he spent the last 30 years
pretending to be Raymond Reddington...</i>

41:16.099 --> 41:17.556
<i>...I'll figure that out.</i>

41:18.851 --> 41:21.434
And then I'm going to destroy him.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.684
Be careful, Liz.

41:25.191 --> 41:26.227
This man...

41:27.402 --> 41:29.439
...whoever he is...

41:30.113 --> 41:31.604
...he's dangerous.

41:31.781 --> 41:32.988
I know he is.

41:34.534 --> 41:36.571
But I'm not alone.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.903
I have help.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.998
You ready?

41:46.587 --> 41:48.203
Oh, yeah.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.209
I'm ready.
