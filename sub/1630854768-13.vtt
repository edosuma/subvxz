WEBVTT

00:02.895 --> 00:05.062
(indistinct chatter)

00:05.064 --> 00:06.171
(squeals)

00:06.323 --> 00:07.914
-Morning, Addie.
-ADDIE: Oh, my God.

00:08.067 --> 00:09.842
Tabs, did you hear about Jason?

00:10.069 --> 00:11.752
Easy, Addie.
I-I just walked in.

00:11.828 --> 00:12.994
It's way too early for gossip.

00:13.014 --> 00:13.995
Oh, it's never too early.

00:14.015 --> 00:15.255
Especially when it's hot goss.

00:15.332 --> 00:17.424
Okay, so guess
who is right over there

00:17.501 --> 00:20.552
waving around
his naked finger? Jason!

00:20.704 --> 00:22.670
-How much coffee have you had?
-(Addie squeals)

00:22.690 --> 00:25.766
Oh, not nearly enough.
I've been up all night working
on the Mortenson presentation.

00:25.918 --> 00:28.510
But are you even listening
to what I am saying?

00:28.587 --> 00:31.922
Jason is not wearing
his wedding ring.

00:31.940 --> 00:33.198
(gasps) I heard he
and his wife,

00:33.275 --> 00:35.926
that ice queen in marketing,
are splits.

00:35.928 --> 00:37.036
-This is sad.
-(laughs) Oh.

00:37.187 --> 00:38.871
You haven't even
heard the saddest part.

00:38.947 --> 00:40.873
No, I mean, you are sad.

00:40.949 --> 00:43.375
She's pregnant.
With twins, I heard.

00:43.527 --> 00:45.269
I'm guessing
that it was in vitro...

00:45.271 --> 00:46.861
(slurring) ...'cause anytime
they're over 35

00:46.881 --> 00:48.438
with multiples,
is like, "Sure!"

00:48.440 --> 00:51.050
-Do you listen to yourself?
-(slurring) Why? It's true.

00:51.126 --> 00:52.626
TABITHA:
No, I mean, listen to yourself.

00:52.778 --> 00:55.112
-Why are you talking like that?
-ADDIE: I don't know.

00:55.114 --> 00:58.557
What? Something is--
W-- Something's wrong.

00:58.634 --> 01:00.041
My-my tongue.

01:00.061 --> 01:01.393
The... Uh...

01:01.512 --> 01:04.304
-Help. Help!
-TABITHA: Oh, my God. Addie.

01:04.381 --> 01:06.790
(gasping)
What happened to me?

01:06.809 --> 01:10.218
-Did-did... Did you put
almond milk in your coffee?
-(Addie gasping)

01:10.237 --> 01:12.145
-Are you allergic?
-(muffled) I don't know.

01:12.298 --> 01:14.631
Okay, I think you're having
an allergic reaction.

01:14.650 --> 01:16.483
Um, does anybody
have an EpiPen?

01:16.635 --> 01:18.059
-(Addie slurring)
-TABITHA: Okay, I got you.

01:18.137 --> 01:19.970
It's okay.
Do not worry.

01:19.988 --> 01:21.955
Okay, I need an EpiPen.
Anyone?

01:22.065 --> 01:23.231
-Hold still.
-I have one.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.733
-Okay. Okay. Thank you so much.
-(Addie gasping)

01:25.753 --> 01:28.253
Okay. Uh, here.

01:28.831 --> 01:30.905
-Okay, relax. I got it.
-Okay.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.907
Okay. Okay.
(deep breaths)

01:33.152 --> 01:35.243
(all gasp)

01:35.262 --> 01:36.486
Okay.

01:36.488 --> 01:37.745
(dramatic music)

01:37.765 --> 01:38.822
What?

01:38.824 --> 01:40.390
(screams)

01:42.620 --> 01:44.177
-Whose tongue?
-TABITHA (over phone):
<i> My coworker.</i>

01:44.254 --> 01:45.270
<i> Um, she was just talking,</i>
<i> and all of a sudden</i>

01:45.347 --> 01:47.088
<i> her tongue</i>
<i> started puffing up.</i>

01:47.166 --> 01:47.940
Okay. How puffed
are we talkin'?

01:47.942 --> 01:49.516
TABITHA:
Like, as big as my fist.

01:49.668 --> 01:51.110
GRACE RYDER:
<i> Can you tell me</i>
<i> where you're calling from?</i>

01:51.261 --> 01:53.278
Um, we're at a Tele-Lively.
11-08 Sawyer.

01:53.430 --> 01:55.114
<i> We're in the second floor</i>
<i> break room.</i>

01:55.265 --> 01:56.340
Help is on the way.

01:56.358 --> 01:57.616
-What's your name?
-TABITHA:<i> Tabitha.</i>

01:57.767 --> 01:59.192
GRACE:
<i> You wanna tell me</i>
<i> how this got started?</i>

01:59.269 --> 02:00.953
-I thought she had
a nut allergy.
-(Addie gasping)

02:01.029 --> 02:02.346
She-she drank some almond milk,

02:02.364 --> 02:04.439
and so I tried
giving her an EpiPen,

02:04.458 --> 02:06.199
-but then I think
I just made it worse.
-(Addie gurgling)

02:06.352 --> 02:07.868
TABITHA: Oh God,
is that even possible?

02:07.944 --> 02:09.277
GRACE:
Unfortunately, it is.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.188
You said that her tongue
is just swelling?

02:11.206 --> 02:13.114
-Yes.
-GRACE:<i> And does</i>
<i> she have a rash,</i>

02:13.192 --> 02:14.449
<i> -hives, anything like that?</i>
-(Addie gasping)

02:14.468 --> 02:16.526
-No. Not that I see.
-GRACE:<i> Your friend,</i>

02:16.545 --> 02:19.396
was she under any stress
or in a state of excitement

02:19.398 --> 02:21.289
or agitation
when symptoms started?

02:21.367 --> 02:23.642
She was up all night
working on a presentation,

02:23.719 --> 02:26.127
and I'm pretty sure
she was really excited

02:26.129 --> 02:27.479
about Jason not wearing
his wedding ring.

02:27.589 --> 02:29.723
-(mumbles)
-GRACE:
<i> Is Jason her husband?</i>

02:29.875 --> 02:30.540
I think she wishes.

02:30.559 --> 02:31.708
(moaning)

02:31.819 --> 02:33.226
GRACE:
I think your friend
has a condition

02:33.320 --> 02:34.987
called hereditary angioedema.

02:35.063 --> 02:37.322
<i> It's facial swelling</i>
<i> triggered by stress.</i>

02:37.399 --> 02:39.849
-(gagging)
-TABITHA: Oh, my God.

02:39.885 --> 02:41.160
Addie!
Oh, my God, Addie.

02:41.236 --> 02:42.886
Tabitha, talk to me.
What's going on with Addie?

02:42.905 --> 02:43.887
TABITHA:
<i> She-she can't breathe.</i>

02:43.906 --> 02:45.164
Her tongue
is blocking her throat.

02:45.315 --> 02:46.072
Where are the paramedics?

02:46.225 --> 02:47.332
They're still a few minutes out.

02:47.484 --> 02:49.835
-She's turning blue.
-Jason, I'm on with 9-1-1.

02:49.912 --> 02:52.504
-What happened?
-GRACE: Tabitha, you said
you guys are in the break room.

02:52.581 --> 02:54.489
Is there a drinking straw
anywhere around?

02:54.508 --> 02:57.401
Wait, wait, I have a straw
in my water bottle.

02:57.419 --> 02:58.735
GRACE:<i> That's perfect.</i>
<i> Jason, you listening?</i>

02:58.754 --> 02:59.994
-Yes, ma'am.
-GRACE:<i> Okay.</i>

03:00.014 --> 03:01.905
Do you guys keep silverware
in the break room?

03:01.924 --> 03:02.830
Maybe like a spoon?

03:02.850 --> 03:04.183
-Yeah.
-GRACE:<i> Okay, good.</i>

03:04.334 --> 03:05.684
<i> I need you to take</i>
<i> the handle end</i>

03:05.835 --> 03:08.929
<i> and use it as a depressor</i>
<i> to press Addie's tongue down.</i>

03:09.081 --> 03:10.580
JASON:
Uh... Okay, yeah.

03:10.599 --> 03:12.340
Tabitha, I need you
to take the straw

03:12.434 --> 03:14.193
and gently guide it
over her tongue.

03:14.420 --> 03:16.177
<i> But we're not trying to</i>
<i> shove it all the way down.</i>

03:16.255 --> 03:18.030
<i> We just wanna</i>
<i> get past the swelling.</i>

03:19.942 --> 03:21.258
It's in. It-it's in!

03:21.351 --> 03:22.659
GRACE:
<i> Okay, that's great.</i>

03:23.871 --> 03:25.353
She-she, she's not breathing.

03:25.431 --> 03:26.596
Then I need for you
to wake her up.

03:26.598 --> 03:27.597
Addie, come on.

03:27.783 --> 03:29.708
Addie. This--
It's-it's, this is not working.

03:29.785 --> 03:32.711
Jason,
I need you to pinch Addie
and pinch her hard.

03:32.788 --> 03:34.104
-Pinch her?
-Just do it.

03:34.106 --> 03:35.622
TABITHA:
Okay...

03:35.699 --> 03:36.940
(gasps sharply)

03:37.367 --> 03:40.201
Okay, she-she's breathing.
Oh, thank God she's breathing.

03:40.203 --> 03:41.327
That's what I like to hear.

03:41.405 --> 03:42.295
NANCY GILLIAN:
Austin EMS.

03:42.372 --> 03:43.705
Step aside.
We got it from here.

03:43.782 --> 03:45.891
TABITHA: Grace, um,
the paramedics just got here.

03:46.042 --> 03:47.451
Thank you. You were amazing.

03:47.711 --> 03:49.561
-Well, you guys weren't
too bad yourselves.
-TABITHA:<i> Thank you.</i>

03:49.638 --> 03:52.046
BP's good, respirations
are almost normal.

03:52.124 --> 03:54.215
OPA's secure.
Airways are clear.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.050
So she-she's gonna be okay?

03:56.070 --> 03:57.477
I-I didn't hurt her
with that straw?

03:57.554 --> 03:59.053
No, actually,
you saved her life.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.364
JASON: There it is.

04:01.633 --> 04:02.658
Uh...

04:03.469 --> 04:04.076
My wedding ring.

04:04.728 --> 04:07.287
My wife was gonna kill me
if I didn't find this.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.248
(mouths)

04:10.233 --> 04:11.475
And let that be
a lesson to you.

04:11.477 --> 04:13.810
Once that thing is on,
it stays on.

04:13.812 --> 04:14.920
Oh, that's the plan.

04:14.997 --> 04:18.740
(theme music plays)

04:18.759 --> 04:20.500
(distant siren wails)

04:20.652 --> 04:22.261
(cooing)

04:22.337 --> 04:24.263
DENISE: That roast
was excellent, Gracie.

04:24.339 --> 04:25.822
You're gonna have
to tell me your secret

04:25.841 --> 04:26.914
how you get it so tender.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.083
Just cook it low,
cook it slow, Mama.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.251
And then have
your husband check it

04:30.271 --> 04:31.328
every ten minutes or so.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.346
(chuckles)
Well, it was wonderful.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.547
Thanks to both of you.

04:34.699 --> 04:36.275
-That's our pleasure.
-BENJAMIN: What?

04:36.351 --> 04:38.685
Baby, would you look at that?

04:39.187 --> 04:41.280
Now, when did my grandbaby
start coloring?

04:41.356 --> 04:43.189
She's been doing this
a few months, Dad.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.341
Well, last time I saw her,

04:44.359 --> 04:46.009
she was tryin'
to get down solid food.

04:46.512 --> 04:49.362
Now she's like a,
a little Leonardo da Vinci.

04:49.439 --> 04:51.181
She's like a little
Jackson Pollock,

04:51.199 --> 04:52.516
except she can
keep it all on the page.

04:52.534 --> 04:54.868
They do grow up so fast,
don't they?

04:54.986 --> 04:56.753
Yeah, too fast.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.448
You know, uh,
Herbert and Yvonne Carter,

05:00.467 --> 05:03.168
they babysit their grandsons
every other weekend.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.470
Well, their grandsons
are older.

05:05.622 --> 05:08.956
They're six and, and ten.
Charlie's a baby still.

05:09.034 --> 05:10.642
Well, not so much
a baby anymore.

05:11.419 --> 05:13.887
Plus, we would like
to see her a few more times

05:13.963 --> 05:15.705
before she's a teenager.

05:15.724 --> 05:17.441
(Charlie cooing)

05:19.320 --> 05:22.321
Well, tell you what
the good news is.

05:22.472 --> 05:24.714
(sighs) You can take home
your very own

05:24.716 --> 05:27.734
-Charlie girl original tonight.
-DENISE: Oh...

05:27.811 --> 05:29.661
What a masterpiece.

05:29.813 --> 05:31.145
Don't you agree, dear?

05:31.165 --> 05:32.906
Absolutely. Absolutely.
(chuckles)

05:33.483 --> 05:35.559
You know, uh, precociousness
runs in the family.

05:35.577 --> 05:38.319
Mm-hmm. Well, not
on her daddy's side, it don't.

05:38.397 --> 05:40.413
Gracie, when she was
about Charlie's age,

05:40.566 --> 05:43.175
was already doing
three-part harmony
with her sisters.

05:43.326 --> 05:46.511
Hmm. No, that's
a little early, Dad.

05:46.663 --> 05:47.846
God's truth.

05:47.997 --> 05:49.573
More like father's truth.

05:50.500 --> 05:54.077
'Cause Lisa wasn't talkin' yet,
and Ash wasn't born.

05:54.096 --> 05:55.503
She's got you there, Benji.

05:55.747 --> 05:58.415
-Well, maybe I got the dates
mixed up a little bit.
-Yeah.

05:58.417 --> 06:00.174
But, boy, let me tell you,

06:00.194 --> 06:02.752
the three of y'all
made some beautiful music.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.697
You know, I just wish that
y'all would get back together

06:05.849 --> 06:08.182
and just start singing more
like you used to.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.944
You got such
a beautiful voice now, Gracie.

06:11.096 --> 06:12.112
Uh, doesn't she, Judd?

06:12.264 --> 06:14.021
Was the first thing
I fell in love with.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.449
BENJAMIN: You know,
I don't think I've heard

06:16.602 --> 06:19.285
the three of you sing
together since...

06:19.438 --> 06:22.381
was it, uh... w-what, ab-about
three Christmases ago?

06:22.457 --> 06:25.050
-Oh, maybe five Christmases ago?
-(Charlie coos)

06:25.611 --> 06:27.611
It was before the pandemic,
and the girls,

06:28.204 --> 06:29.629
they're always
in the recording studio

06:29.781 --> 06:33.466
in Nashville somewhere
or on the road doing a show.

06:33.543 --> 06:37.437
So, I-I-I can't tell you,
to be honest. I don't know.

06:38.548 --> 06:41.808
Well, a father
can always dream, huh?

06:41.885 --> 06:43.026
GRACE: Mm-hmm.

06:43.979 --> 06:45.052
(cell phone ringing)

06:45.130 --> 06:46.312
-JUDD RYDER: Hmm.
-Here you go.

06:46.389 --> 06:48.615
-(ringing continues)
-(Charlie cooing)

06:49.134 --> 06:50.575
Rita, hey.

06:51.561 --> 06:53.895
Oh, no.

06:53.989 --> 06:55.472
Okay, no, no, no.
That's okay.

06:55.490 --> 06:56.748
You stay hydrated.

06:57.659 --> 06:59.251
Alright. No, thanks.

06:59.402 --> 07:01.068
Sweetheart, that was Rita.

07:01.663 --> 07:03.922
She's got the flu,
so she can't babysit.

07:03.999 --> 07:05.982
-Oh, no.
-Oh, we'll do it.

07:06.042 --> 07:07.759
Yes, we would love to, honey.

07:07.836 --> 07:09.094
No, that's okay.

07:09.171 --> 07:11.004
We don't wanna put you guys out.

07:11.156 --> 07:12.413
JUDD:
I think that's a great idea.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.324
That's very, very generous.
Thank you.

07:14.826 --> 07:17.177
And I think Charlie would like
to, uh, spend a little time

07:17.253 --> 07:18.937
-with her grandparents.
-(Charlie coos)

07:19.088 --> 07:20.605
(Benjamin chuckles)

07:27.339 --> 07:29.281
Hey. Charlie get to sleep okay?

07:29.432 --> 07:30.574
GRACE: Mm-hmm.

07:33.770 --> 07:35.954
(sighs) So, what,
you ain't talkin' to me now?

07:36.031 --> 07:38.623
You know, I just don't wanna say
something I might regret, Judd.

07:38.775 --> 07:39.774
That's it.

07:40.035 --> 07:41.851
You're still mad
'cause I managed to wrangle us

07:41.853 --> 07:43.211
some free childcare?

07:44.614 --> 07:47.632
(sighs) You know that I'm not
comfortable with him

07:47.784 --> 07:48.708
watchin' our daughter.

07:48.785 --> 07:50.376
Well, honey,
I'm not comfortable

07:50.529 --> 07:52.286
anytime y'all are
in the same room together,

07:52.364 --> 07:55.381
and I ain't the only one
who notices either.

07:55.534 --> 07:57.934
Well, what are you
talkin' about? My mom or my dad?

07:58.979 --> 08:00.704
No, I'm talkin'
about your daughter.

08:01.297 --> 08:04.224
I mean, come on, babies pick up
on stuff like that, Grace,

08:04.300 --> 08:05.817
with all that tension in the air
and everything.

08:06.803 --> 08:10.822
And another thing, sweetheart,
is you've barely had them around

08:10.899 --> 08:12.824
ever since we had Charlie.

08:12.901 --> 08:14.284
And that ain't right.

08:15.070 --> 08:17.070
You know what's not right?

08:17.222 --> 08:19.055
Steppin' out on your marriage.

08:19.074 --> 08:20.982
That's-that's-that's
really not right.

08:21.059 --> 08:22.167
Hey, look, I agree.

08:22.318 --> 08:24.077
Your daddy messed up, okay?

08:24.153 --> 08:26.153
But that was two years ago.

08:26.231 --> 08:29.174
He did it one time,
and he repented.

08:29.325 --> 08:31.084
Yeah, to you, Judd.

08:31.661 --> 08:33.178
And to you only, actually.

08:33.405 --> 08:34.846
And that probably
has something to do

08:34.998 --> 08:36.422
with the fact
that you caught him.

08:36.908 --> 08:39.743
I don't know how long you want
that man to stay punished.

08:40.595 --> 08:43.647
Well, how long would you
expect to stay punished for?

08:45.675 --> 08:49.936
(laughs) No. No, no, no.
That's a trap. I'm not doin' it.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.864
Okay, I get it.
It happened one time.

08:53.016 --> 08:55.200
But every time I'm with my mom

08:55.277 --> 08:58.703
and I have to pretend
like nothing happened

08:58.780 --> 08:59.871
and that everything's fine,

08:59.948 --> 09:02.290
I feel like
I'm lying to her then.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.934
I understand.

09:04.953 --> 09:06.119
But you can't keep doin' this.

09:06.271 --> 09:08.380
I mean, this-this
ain't healthy for anybody.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.031
Yeah, I know.

09:10.108 --> 09:11.550
So you either gotta go

09:11.701 --> 09:16.203
and, I mean, fully have it out
with that man about what he did.

09:16.281 --> 09:19.057
Or you gotta let go
and let God.

09:28.810 --> 09:31.027
♪♪

09:31.963 --> 09:33.479
Oh! Oof!

09:33.632 --> 09:35.890
-(Owen exhales)
-Wow. That was...
(clears throat)

09:35.909 --> 09:36.816
Oof, man.

09:36.893 --> 09:38.893
I mean,
a tip of the hat to you.

09:38.912 --> 09:39.819
(Kendra exhales)

09:39.896 --> 09:40.987
It was a team effort.

09:41.064 --> 09:42.063
Ooh, if there was an audience,

09:42.140 --> 09:43.306
they would be asking
for an encore.

09:43.399 --> 09:45.750
-(Owen exhales)
-I think that was the encore.

09:45.902 --> 09:47.143
(Owen grunts)

09:47.162 --> 09:48.253
Are you okay over there?

09:48.330 --> 09:50.905
(laughs)
I think I pulled a glute.

09:51.483 --> 09:53.666
-Wait a minute.
-KENDRA: (laughs) What?

09:53.819 --> 09:56.669
You have
a Rudolf Stingel biography
on your bedside table?

09:56.822 --> 09:57.596
How did I not see that?

09:57.931 --> 10:00.640
I think your attention
was directed elsewhere.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.843
Did you Google me?

10:03.995 --> 10:05.419
Um, no. Why do you ask?

10:05.439 --> 10:08.665
Because my love for Stingel
is a matter of public record.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.442
Oh, and what record is that?

10:10.593 --> 10:14.170
The 1999 Manhattan
Firefighter Calendar.

10:14.189 --> 10:16.948
You're looking at Mr. October.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.432
Now, I'm definitely
gonna Google.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.843
Now, one of the things
they asked me was,

10:19.861 --> 10:22.178
who's my favorite artist,
and I told 'em Stingel.

10:22.197 --> 10:23.696
I'd been to an exhibition,

10:23.865 --> 10:27.125
and, boy, the first time
you see one of those
in person, it is w...

10:28.353 --> 10:29.853
You know what?
As I'm talking, I'm realizing

10:29.855 --> 10:32.279
you probably have one
hanging in your dining room.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.132
-No, it's in the library.
-(Owen laughs)

10:34.283 --> 10:36.801
You are amazing.
You know that?

10:36.953 --> 10:38.136
You're not so bad yourself.

10:38.287 --> 10:39.787
Mm. You know what?

10:40.532 --> 10:42.957
I'm gonna say something
and I think it may sound crazy.

10:43.034 --> 10:44.517
-But--
-I know what you're gonna say.

10:45.053 --> 10:46.219
You do?

10:46.295 --> 10:48.554
Even though it's only
been a few weeks...

10:49.132 --> 10:51.541
-It feels so goo--
-...meant to be.

10:52.093 --> 10:54.043
You went full "meant to be!"

10:54.062 --> 10:55.211
Oh no, was that too much?

10:55.230 --> 10:57.046
-No. No, it's perfect.
-(dog barks)

10:57.065 --> 10:59.824
Who-who is this beautiful boy?

10:59.976 --> 11:02.218
-Brett!
-Oh, hi, Brett.

11:02.220 --> 11:04.570
No. (chuckles)
No, this is Brady.

11:04.723 --> 11:05.388
Who's Brett?

11:05.407 --> 11:06.239
Sorry.

11:06.607 --> 11:08.725
He wanted to say hi
to your new friend.

11:08.743 --> 11:10.693
(Brady panting)

11:10.695 --> 11:11.628
Hi.

11:13.064 --> 11:14.230
Hi.

11:14.232 --> 11:15.173
I'm sorry, I didn't know

11:15.324 --> 11:16.991
that Kendra had a... brother?

11:17.010 --> 11:18.843
Several.
But I'm her husband.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.253
You're-you're what now?

11:20.405 --> 11:21.179
BRETT:
It's nice to meet you, Owen.

11:21.330 --> 11:22.422
Mind if I grab a golf shirt?

11:22.498 --> 11:24.683
-I've got a tee time.
-Go ahead.

11:24.759 --> 11:25.909
You know my name?

11:25.927 --> 11:27.243
BRETT:
Her voice carries.

11:27.746 --> 11:29.170
I hope you don't
have a shotgun in there.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.080
BRETT:
Nope. Just golf shirts.

11:31.082 --> 11:32.190
If your glute's bothering you,

11:32.341 --> 11:33.766
you should jump
in the cryo-sauna downstairs

11:33.843 --> 11:34.751
before you go.

11:34.753 --> 11:35.585
It works wonders.

11:36.104 --> 11:38.363
Yeah, I'll-I'll-I'll take
that into consideration.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.032
Brady, come on.
Let's let them
enjoy their morning.

11:41.109 --> 11:43.626
Come on.
Alright, you extortionist.

11:43.929 --> 11:45.762
(chuckles) Sit.

11:45.780 --> 11:46.763
Good boy.

11:46.781 --> 11:48.355
Owen, it was a pleasure.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.417
Kendy-Cane,
I'll see you tonight.

11:54.105 --> 11:55.621
Um... Okay.

11:55.740 --> 11:58.532
You-you didn't tell me that you
were in the middle of a divorce.

11:58.610 --> 11:59.542
I'm not.

12:00.462 --> 12:03.037
Okay, now
I'm totally confused.

12:03.131 --> 12:04.781
(chuckles) By what?

12:05.300 --> 12:07.374
The fact that in all the times

12:07.452 --> 12:08.785
that we've been in bed
and at galas

12:08.803 --> 12:11.212
and in bed and at dinners
and also then in bed

12:11.289 --> 12:13.122
that you never thought
to mention the fact

12:13.141 --> 12:14.307
that you were
happily married?

12:14.459 --> 12:16.717
Well, it's not exactly a secret.

12:16.795 --> 12:18.644
I mean, our pictures
are kinda everywhere.

12:18.797 --> 12:20.071
All the society journals...

12:20.223 --> 12:23.224
Oh, well-well, my subscription
to the society journals,

12:23.301 --> 12:25.468
they expired in 1912.

12:25.470 --> 12:27.153
You mean to tell me
he's okay with this?

12:27.305 --> 12:30.156
Yeah. We both are.

12:30.308 --> 12:33.159
We have
a non-traditional marriage.

12:33.236 --> 12:35.086
Like an open marriage.

12:35.163 --> 12:37.422
Oh, no.
You are totally freaking out.

12:37.499 --> 12:39.090
No, no.
No, I'm not freaking out.

12:39.167 --> 12:42.469
I'm-I'm just trying to process.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.264
Kendy-Cane?

12:50.419 --> 12:51.102
(whirring)

12:51.271 --> 12:53.997
Hey, Dad.
You got a visitor.

12:53.999 --> 12:54.939
-Burt?
-Brett.

12:55.091 --> 12:56.516
-Brett.
-BRETT: Hey, Owen.

12:56.668 --> 12:58.943
Bet you weren't expecting
to see me again so soon.

12:59.095 --> 13:01.521
No, I was not.
What can I do for you?

13:01.615 --> 13:04.598
I believe you took something
that belongs to me.

13:05.026 --> 13:07.994
-She's not here.
-I meant my sunglasses.

13:09.030 --> 13:10.604
Ah, yes. They...

13:11.124 --> 13:12.515
Don't know
how that happened.

13:12.534 --> 13:15.852
Well, you must have
grabbed 'em off my nightstand

13:15.870 --> 13:17.003
on your way out.

13:18.189 --> 13:20.548
-Sorry about that.
-BRETT: No problem.

13:21.117 --> 13:22.509
Happy to share.

13:24.029 --> 13:25.428
Are ya?

13:27.032 --> 13:28.031
Wow. (chuckles)

13:28.550 --> 13:31.217
I can see why Kendra
was so taken with this place.

13:31.369 --> 13:33.703
It is really charming.

13:33.721 --> 13:34.646
We like it.

13:35.298 --> 13:37.056
Everybody, this is
my girlfriend's husband,

13:37.133 --> 13:38.274
Brett Harrington.

13:39.210 --> 13:40.467
BRETT:
It's Collier, actually.

13:40.545 --> 13:42.970
Oh, yeah, of course.
You wouldn't take her name.

13:43.048 --> 13:44.989
I got everything else, though.

13:45.066 --> 13:46.716
TK STRAND:
Hold on.

13:46.734 --> 13:47.975
Kendra's married?

13:48.053 --> 13:49.244
Happily.

13:49.979 --> 13:51.054
So they say.

13:51.072 --> 13:51.830
Why does this keep happening?

13:51.981 --> 13:52.997
Wow. So, um...
(clears throat)

13:53.149 --> 13:54.907
So you're in a throuple, Cap?

13:55.060 --> 13:56.334
Not exactly.

13:56.485 --> 13:59.003
Kendra and I
have an open marriage.

13:59.155 --> 14:00.171
We love each other deeply,

14:00.248 --> 14:01.840
but everyone knows
monogamy is dead.

14:01.916 --> 14:03.082
Is it?

14:03.159 --> 14:05.326
No. But you will be.

14:05.403 --> 14:07.920
We figure why keep
beating a dead horse

14:07.997 --> 14:10.256
when you can invite
a new stallion into the barn?

14:10.408 --> 14:12.016
-Oh, God.
-(all groan)

14:12.093 --> 14:14.260
It's all very modern
and evolved.

14:14.337 --> 14:15.761
Sounds like wife swappin'.

14:15.838 --> 14:17.021
I don't have a wife to swap.

14:17.173 --> 14:19.006
You're the only one
who doesn't, evidently.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.933
(clears throat)
Well, I should trot.

14:21.086 --> 14:22.101
Thanks for the glasses.

14:22.178 --> 14:24.112
See you back at the stables.

14:27.775 --> 14:31.202
Oh, un-clutch your pearls.
It's not that outrageous.

14:31.395 --> 14:32.662
Go on, get back to work.

14:34.023 --> 14:34.931
Okay.

14:34.933 --> 14:35.948
(indistinct chatter)

14:36.101 --> 14:37.950
(laughter)

14:38.103 --> 14:39.627
I gotta hand it to you, Cap.

14:40.939 --> 14:42.105
You're a bigger man than me.

14:42.107 --> 14:43.530
I could never, you know,

14:43.608 --> 14:45.550
do it with a gal whose husband's
in the next room.

14:45.701 --> 14:49.946
There's no way I'm ever
going back to that guy's house.

14:50.039 --> 14:53.474
-(siren wailing)
-(horn honking)

14:56.379 --> 14:58.212
Dispatch say who made the call?

14:58.231 --> 15:00.973
Homeowner. He's trapped
in the east motor court.

15:01.126 --> 15:02.141
JUDD (over radio):
<i> East motor court.</i>

15:02.218 --> 15:03.550
<i> That means they got</i>
<i> more than one.</i>

15:04.103 --> 15:05.811
<i> That's what I call</i>
<i> livin' high on the cotton.</i>

15:05.980 --> 15:07.630
PAUL STRICKLAND (over radio):
<i> Man, they got</i>
<i> their own lemon grove.</i>

15:07.632 --> 15:09.991
MATEO CHAVEZ (over radio):
<i> That's my dream.</i>

15:13.413 --> 15:15.304
PAUL:
Man, I feel like I'm in
an episode of<i> Dynasty.</i>

15:15.398 --> 15:17.749
-Except it's Harrington,
not Carrington.
-Huh.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.752
(man screaming)

15:21.254 --> 15:23.162
God! Get this thing
off of me, please.

15:23.239 --> 15:24.422
Alright,
fire just landed, alright?

15:24.499 --> 15:26.332
I need you
to stop thrashing around.

15:26.409 --> 15:27.926
You've got
an open compound fracture.

15:28.153 --> 15:29.761
You can sever an artery
or lose a hand.

15:29.837 --> 15:31.429
-God, it hurts so much!
-TOMMY VEGA: I know. I know.

15:31.580 --> 15:33.156
We're getting you
something for that right now.

15:33.158 --> 15:34.265
-Nancy, morphine?
-Already on it, Cap.

15:34.342 --> 15:36.250
TK: He's severely
tachycardic, Cap.

15:36.327 --> 15:37.677
BRETT:
Get this thing off me!

15:37.829 --> 15:39.162
(screams, cries)

15:39.180 --> 15:40.921
Hey, is that sunglasses guy?

15:40.941 --> 15:42.089
JUDD: Yeah.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.350
Cap, is this
your girlfriend's house?

15:44.502 --> 15:46.277
Paul, Judd,
chock and crib that side.

15:46.429 --> 15:47.594
Teo, you shore up this side.

15:47.672 --> 15:49.672
Marjan, get ready to
slide in that airbag.

15:49.691 --> 15:51.449
-So this is gonna be weird.
-Yup.

15:51.526 --> 15:53.952
-Hey, Brett.
-Hey, Owen. You here for Kendra?

15:54.529 --> 15:56.679
I'm kidding. Can you
get this off me, please?

15:56.681 --> 15:59.290
It's what we're gonna do.
Tell me what exactly happened.

15:59.367 --> 16:01.793
I was rotating
Kendra's tires for her.

16:01.869 --> 16:02.702
The jack must have slipped.

16:02.778 --> 16:03.869
(groans) Oh, God!

16:03.946 --> 16:05.021
Please hurry.

16:05.039 --> 16:06.780
Okay, hold still.

16:06.858 --> 16:08.357
Oh! I need more morphine.

16:08.951 --> 16:10.359
I already gave him
ten mils, Cap.

16:10.378 --> 16:11.210
Alright, Brett,
that's-that's the most

16:11.362 --> 16:12.211
we can do for you right now.

16:12.288 --> 16:14.380
(screams) Oh, God!

16:14.457 --> 16:15.640
I can't do this.

16:15.791 --> 16:16.975
Yes, you can.

16:17.126 --> 16:18.534
Alright, listen to me.

16:18.553 --> 16:20.311
My team is very close
to getting this car off of you,

16:20.463 --> 16:22.296
but it's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.223
So I need you to close your eyes

16:24.375 --> 16:26.242
and focus on your breathing,
in and out.

16:26.244 --> 16:27.485
Just like that. Good.

16:27.636 --> 16:29.136
Now I want you to think
of something you love

16:29.155 --> 16:30.896
more than anything else
in the world.

16:30.973 --> 16:32.281
You got an image in your head?

16:33.218 --> 16:34.475
Okay, you hold on to that.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.661
-MARJAN MARWANI: Cap.
-Paul?

16:36.904 --> 16:38.054
(whirring)

16:38.056 --> 16:40.081
(screaming)

16:41.726 --> 16:42.742
Now.

16:42.894 --> 16:44.961
(groaning)

16:45.747 --> 16:47.463
(groans)

16:49.492 --> 16:51.067
TOMMY:
How's your pain level now?

16:51.160 --> 16:53.177
Better.
Although I shudder to think

16:53.329 --> 16:54.937
what it'll mean
for my golf game.

16:54.997 --> 16:55.680
(snickers)

16:55.757 --> 16:56.922
Hey, do yourself a favor.

16:56.999 --> 16:59.333
Next time, just take
the car into the shop.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.243
BRETT: I will.

17:00.578 --> 17:03.929
Thank you
for talking me through that.

17:04.006 --> 17:05.440
Your little trick worked.

17:06.267 --> 17:08.584
Picturing what I love most.

17:08.677 --> 17:10.920
KENDRA:
Brett?

17:10.938 --> 17:13.422
(running footsteps approaching)

17:14.275 --> 17:16.350
-KENDRA: Oh, my God. (panting)
-He's gonna be okay. He--

17:16.427 --> 17:18.094
KENDRA:
Brett, what happened to you?

17:18.112 --> 17:19.095
I'm so sorry.

17:19.113 --> 17:20.613
I was so scared

17:20.765 --> 17:22.448
I was never gonna see you again.

17:22.525 --> 17:24.542
-Awkward.
-Ooh. For him or for us?

17:24.693 --> 17:25.601
MARJAN: Hmm.

17:25.861 --> 17:27.861
TK: He's got good
capillary refill, Cap.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.772
NANCY:
Wound is stabilized.
He's ready for transport.

17:29.774 --> 17:33.468
Uh, uh, can I ride with him?
He's my husband. (pants)

17:34.036 --> 17:35.428
Of course.

17:38.966 --> 17:41.875
Hey. You ridin' with us?

17:41.895 --> 17:43.478
-(ambulance starts)
-(scoffs)

17:51.145 --> 17:52.128
-(knock on door)
-Good morning.

17:52.146 --> 17:53.479
Grandparents
reporting for duty.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.148
Oh, no, no, no.
She's actually
still asleep, guys.

17:56.301 --> 17:59.135
-(Charlie crying)
-Oh, well, she was still asleep.

17:59.153 --> 18:00.986
We're sorry, baby.
We just came a little early.

18:01.063 --> 18:02.246
-That's okay.
-(crying continues)

18:02.398 --> 18:04.490
-Okay if I get her?
-GRACE: Yeah.

18:04.567 --> 18:05.566
She'd like that, Mom.

18:05.734 --> 18:08.327
-(crying continues)
-(Benjamin chuckles)

18:08.479 --> 18:11.756
So, uh... is-is
my son-in-law around?

18:12.166 --> 18:14.317
No, he's on his shift.

18:14.335 --> 18:16.243
Um, you wanna
just come this way?

18:16.321 --> 18:18.596
-I can show you
where everything's at.
-Sure.

18:19.248 --> 18:21.432
Her fruit cups
are in the cabinet.

18:21.659 --> 18:23.417
She has a snack at 9:30,
but only one, please.

18:23.494 --> 18:25.177
Otherwise,
she's not gonna eat lunch.

18:25.330 --> 18:27.087
Uh, she can watch two episodes

18:27.165 --> 18:29.682
of<i> Doc McStuffins</i>
after her nap.

18:29.834 --> 18:31.442
It's on Hulu, so, just,

18:31.594 --> 18:33.093
there's a little green button
on the remote, just press it.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.780
Dr. McLovin'.
Green button. Got it.

18:35.931 --> 18:37.281
<i> Doc McStuffins.</i>

18:38.284 --> 18:40.509
This is Judd's cell
and his work.

18:40.511 --> 18:42.453
Um, this is my cell
and my work number.

18:42.530 --> 18:44.622
I think I know
that already, baby.

18:45.032 --> 18:46.031
You listening, Dad?

18:46.126 --> 18:48.275
This is not
our first rodeo, honey.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.445
We did raise the three of you
to be amazing young women.

18:51.522 --> 18:52.296
(crying stops)

18:52.523 --> 18:56.950
Now... see,
your mother is a wonder.

18:57.028 --> 18:58.027
She is.

18:58.379 --> 19:01.347
That is something
I, for one, never forget.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.308
Grace...

19:06.146 --> 19:08.462
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

19:08.539 --> 19:09.555
Why do you ask?

19:09.632 --> 19:11.965
It just feels like
you don't want me here.

19:12.043 --> 19:13.651
I do want you here, Dad.

19:14.136 --> 19:15.319
Because when you're here,

19:15.396 --> 19:17.530
you're not out there
getting in trouble.

19:19.975 --> 19:21.384
Grace.

19:21.477 --> 19:24.553
DENISE:
Guess whose overnight diaper
was totally dry?

19:24.555 --> 19:25.496
(Benjamin chuckles)

19:25.832 --> 19:28.557
She made a pee-pee
in the potty like a big girl.

19:28.559 --> 19:30.726
-Yeah, that's my grandbaby.
-DENISE: Yes.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.045
Thanks for getting her, Mom.
I gotta get dressed.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.324
KENDRA:
We've got the yellow tail,

19:37.343 --> 19:39.935
California roll, salmon rolls.

19:39.937 --> 19:41.587
This all looks amazing, Chef.

19:41.664 --> 19:43.973
Thanks for pulling this
together so fast.

19:45.076 --> 19:46.075
Oh. Okay.

19:46.093 --> 19:47.435
Here they come.

19:51.582 --> 19:54.508
Whoa!
It's<i> Iron Chef:</i>
<i> Firehouse Edition.</i>

19:54.527 --> 19:57.420
Hi, everybody.
I hope you didn't stop
for anything on the way back.

19:57.422 --> 19:59.179
Grab a plate
and help yourselves.

19:59.257 --> 20:00.847
-(Paul laughs)
-MARJAN: Wow.

20:00.867 --> 20:01.924
Kendra, wow.

20:01.926 --> 20:03.016
I hope that's a good wow.

20:03.094 --> 20:04.109
Uh, yeah.

20:04.262 --> 20:06.262
(chuckles) I just wanted
to thank you all

20:06.264 --> 20:07.872
for helping Brett the other day.

20:07.949 --> 20:09.373
I hope it's not
too presumptuous.

20:09.525 --> 20:10.857
Hey, we'll always take
a little presumption

20:10.877 --> 20:12.618
if it comes
with a side of ahi tuna.

20:12.695 --> 20:13.436
(team laughing)

20:13.604 --> 20:15.104
Whoa!
Is that Chef Emiko?

20:15.106 --> 20:16.272
TK:
Oh, my God, it is.

20:16.290 --> 20:18.107
It's like a six-month wait
to get a table.

20:18.109 --> 20:19.032
How'd you get him over here?

20:19.052 --> 20:20.384
He did my wedding.

20:20.887 --> 20:21.961
Seriously, guys, dig in.

20:22.113 --> 20:23.888
We've got sashimi and octopus

20:23.965 --> 20:25.372
for the more adventurous

20:25.391 --> 20:27.116
and teriyaki
for those of you who--

20:27.118 --> 20:29.060
Don't eat bait.
(laughs)

20:29.136 --> 20:30.135
Thank you.

20:30.212 --> 20:32.045
Kendra, this is very generous.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.622
Oh, please, Captain Vega.

20:33.624 --> 20:34.881
It's really the least
I could do.

20:34.901 --> 20:38.627
Babe, they have sea urchin.
You have to try it.

20:38.629 --> 20:39.295
What's urchin?

20:39.313 --> 20:40.296
Urchin's what you'd be

20:40.314 --> 20:41.722
if we didn't take you in.

20:42.149 --> 20:43.574
Hey, you're not
gonna grab a plate?

20:43.726 --> 20:45.559
-(Owen chuckles)
-Got bluefin toro at the end.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.970
Can I talk to you
for a second, privately?

20:47.989 --> 20:49.997
Uh-oh. Okay.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.751
-Did I overstep?
-(Owen chuckles)

20:53.828 --> 20:55.235
Is it not regulation?

20:55.255 --> 20:57.546
No, no, no, no.
It's-it's really thoughtful.

20:59.150 --> 21:01.342
But you don't like surprises.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.094
Yeah.

21:03.170 --> 21:04.428
Certain ones.

21:05.414 --> 21:09.174
You're mad I didn't tell you
I had a Range Rover. (chuckles)

21:09.327 --> 21:11.844
Really, this is more about
the guy trapped underneath it.

21:11.996 --> 21:13.754
You're right.
(clears throat)

21:14.499 --> 21:17.924
I could have been more
upfront about my situation.

21:18.002 --> 21:19.443
Normally, when I
start something new,

21:19.595 --> 21:20.778
I'm very clear about it,

21:20.929 --> 21:22.262
so nobody gets the wrong idea.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.689
So why weren't you with me?

21:24.450 --> 21:27.009
Because I think
maybe I wanted you

21:27.102 --> 21:29.036
to get the wrong idea?

21:30.181 --> 21:32.014
My marriage is dead, Owen.

21:32.033 --> 21:33.516
It has been for a while.

21:33.534 --> 21:34.533
It's just...

21:34.685 --> 21:36.685
our arrangement
made it easy for me

21:36.687 --> 21:38.187
to ignore the facts.

21:38.722 --> 21:42.800
But meeting you...
it's not so easy
to ignore anymore.

21:43.303 --> 21:45.261
I think you still love him.

21:46.364 --> 21:47.696
I saw the way you reacted

21:47.715 --> 21:49.640
when we were putting him
in the ambulance.

21:50.368 --> 21:53.311
Uh... A car fell on him.
I-I was concerned.

21:53.462 --> 21:55.704
Of course, I was.
I'm not heartless.

21:55.706 --> 21:58.131
-You know, he showed up here.
-What?

21:58.151 --> 22:00.042
Ostensibly to retrieve
some sunglasses

22:00.061 --> 22:02.378
that I'd accidentally lifted.

22:02.971 --> 22:05.147
But I think he came here
to size me up.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.567
And you can say that you
don't love him anymore,

22:08.719 --> 22:11.329
but let me tell you something,
he's still got it bad for you.

22:11.889 --> 22:14.665
Okay, well, he'll have
to get over it, and he will.

22:14.742 --> 22:17.076
He'll make out like a bandit
based on our prenup.

22:17.228 --> 22:18.836
(chuckles) Look...

22:19.488 --> 22:20.821
I've been through two divorces,

22:20.915 --> 22:25.067
I'm not up for a third,
even if it is somebody else's.

22:25.069 --> 22:26.326
And I certainly
don't wanna be the reason

22:26.404 --> 22:28.087
that you're willing
to declare something dead

22:28.163 --> 22:29.347
that might not be.

22:30.666 --> 22:31.724
So that's it?

22:32.852 --> 22:34.927
Yeah.

22:35.079 --> 22:38.022
I mean, I-I think so, um...
for now.

22:41.361 --> 22:42.342
I had fun.

22:42.420 --> 22:45.029
(slight chuckle) I'm glad.

22:46.014 --> 22:47.013
Well, you should get over there.

22:47.091 --> 22:49.325
You don't wanna
miss the bluefin.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.771
(Brett sighs)

23:02.865 --> 23:03.789
Going for a run?

23:03.941 --> 23:04.957
Brett, what are you doing?

23:05.109 --> 23:07.109
What's it look like?
I'm getting my cryo on.

23:07.111 --> 23:08.386
Should you be using that
with your arm?

23:08.537 --> 23:10.963
It's no big deal.
It's a soft cast.

23:11.115 --> 23:12.281
And nothing's better
for inflammation

23:12.299 --> 23:13.557
than cellular regeneration.

23:13.634 --> 23:15.559
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

23:15.636 --> 23:18.303
-Like you knew
how to rotate my tires.
-(Brett laughs)

23:18.380 --> 23:19.563
I was just worried that
if I let a grease monkey

23:19.565 --> 23:22.024
onto the grounds,
you'd start dating him, too.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.308
You're funny.

23:23.552 --> 23:25.628
And you're upset
about something.

23:25.630 --> 23:29.465
Uh-oh. Did Captain Baggy Pants
take his fire hose and go home?

23:29.483 --> 23:32.559
Ouch. Kendy-Cane.
If looks could kill.

23:32.637 --> 23:33.411
If only.

23:33.487 --> 23:35.913
It's your own fault,
you know.

23:36.064 --> 23:37.581
Not that he dumped you.
He's an idiot.

23:37.658 --> 23:41.160
But that you caught feelings
and kept it going.

23:41.162 --> 23:43.087
(scoffs) You broke our rule.

23:43.164 --> 23:44.647
You got attached.

23:44.649 --> 23:46.406
So I'm sorry if you
got dumped and all,

23:46.500 --> 23:48.575
but I hope it stings.
(winces)

23:48.669 --> 23:50.511
And I hope you freeze to death.

23:54.675 --> 23:56.350
(Brett exhales)

24:02.333 --> 24:04.183
I was out on a run
and when I got back

24:04.335 --> 24:05.734
he was still in there.

24:10.007 --> 24:10.948
I think he's dead.

24:11.600 --> 24:14.526
Okay, Paul, Judd,
let's try to get him out.

24:14.603 --> 24:16.845
Hey, Brett?
Brett, you with us?

24:16.939 --> 24:17.746
Brett?

24:19.107 --> 24:20.683
How long has he been in there?

24:20.685 --> 24:22.184
At least 45 minutes.

24:22.186 --> 24:23.777
It's frozen solid, Cap.

24:23.796 --> 24:27.189
Yeah, I-I tried melting it
with the hair dryer, but no use.

24:27.191 --> 24:29.091
-Okay, Halligan.
-MARJAN: Yep, flying in.

24:30.194 --> 24:33.045
-You turn it off?
-I unplugged it.

24:33.197 --> 24:34.472
There's not
an automatic off switch?

24:34.665 --> 24:37.290
There is, but Brett disabled it
because he knew better.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.034
Alright, what's the ETA
on Medical?

24:39.053 --> 24:39.977
Five or less.

24:40.054 --> 24:41.520
(Judd grunts)

24:43.874 --> 24:46.358
(dramatic music playing)

24:51.807 --> 24:53.882
Alright, let's-let's try
to get him on the floor.

24:53.901 --> 24:55.326
Get some warming blankets.

25:02.317 --> 25:03.575
Brett?

25:03.728 --> 25:04.710
No pulse.

25:06.247 --> 25:07.988
-I'm starting compressions.
-MARJAN: Cap, Medical's here.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.673
(crunches)

25:09.825 --> 25:10.991
(tense music playing)

25:11.010 --> 25:12.384
(gasps)

25:13.254 --> 25:15.554

36:07.741 --> 36:09.040
Dad...

36:10.318 --> 36:12.294
you've been there for me.

36:13.413 --> 36:15.172
And I haven't been
a very good daughter

36:15.248 --> 36:17.090
these past couple of years.

36:18.493 --> 36:21.661
But you've always been
a great dad.

36:21.680 --> 36:25.056
And I'm sorry that I ever
made you feel different.

36:26.243 --> 36:28.101
You were always kind.

36:30.096 --> 36:32.355
And I judged you harsh.

36:35.027 --> 36:36.342
And now I have a kid of my own

36:36.420 --> 36:38.844
that I make
endless mistakes with.

36:38.864 --> 36:39.988
(sighs)

36:42.534 --> 36:45.076
But you never stop
smiling at me. (chuckles)

36:47.039 --> 36:48.663
Which, you know...

36:50.116 --> 36:52.191
Speaking of which,
you were right.

36:52.269 --> 36:55.270
It was three Christmases ago.

36:55.272 --> 36:57.196
The last time the girls and I
were singing together.

36:57.274 --> 37:01.033
You made us sing "Smile"
for every family member

37:01.053 --> 37:02.961
that came to the house that day.

37:03.113 --> 37:04.387
(chuckles)

37:06.058 --> 37:07.373
You never stopped smiling at me

37:07.467 --> 37:09.684
and you never stopped
loving me either.

37:14.975 --> 37:19.444
And I really hope you know
that I never stopped
loving you either.

(gentle music playing)

See, I told you, Denise.

39:36.933 --> 39:38.282
When these three get together...

39:38.435 --> 39:40.268
-Magic.
-(Benjamin laughs)

39:40.286 --> 39:42.120
BENJAMIN:
You know, you ask me,

39:42.196 --> 39:44.772
the Williams sisters
never sounded any better.

39:44.774 --> 39:48.793
Oh, well, I don't know,
I was a little pitchy, so...

39:48.945 --> 39:50.461
Grace, don't be ridiculous.

39:50.538 --> 39:52.296
Yeah, there wasn't nothin'
"little" about it, Grace.

39:52.373 --> 39:53.781
-I'm sorry. I'm just joking.
-(all laughing)

39:53.800 --> 39:54.949
-You know it was good.
-Out.

39:54.968 --> 39:57.118
-You sounded great.
-You sounded great.

39:57.120 --> 39:58.895
Hey, somebody
wanted to say hi to y'all.

39:59.046 --> 40:01.289
-ASHLEY: Oh, the baby!
-Hi, baby.

40:01.307 --> 40:03.549
LISA:
Excuse me. Heya, Charlie.

40:03.627 --> 40:06.218
-Come here. Come here.
-Lisa, that is not fair.

40:06.296 --> 40:07.237
-Give her to Auntie Ash.
-No, me first.

40:07.388 --> 40:08.463
Actually, guys, I'm sorry.

40:08.465 --> 40:09.814
You're gonna
have to wait your turn.

40:09.966 --> 40:13.243
Because she only has eyes
for her granddad right now.

40:13.319 --> 40:15.637
-Hi, y'all. Good to see y'all.
-Hey, Judd.

40:15.655 --> 40:16.654
LISA: Hi.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.916
Daddy, do you wanna hold her?

40:19.993 --> 40:21.142
You sure?

40:21.144 --> 40:22.160
Yeah, I'm positive.

40:22.829 --> 40:25.922
Because you guys have a lot
of lost time to make up for.

40:25.999 --> 40:26.998
-(Charlie coos)
-Hey, boo.

40:27.074 --> 40:28.758
-Hey.
-(laughs) That's my baby.

40:30.077 --> 40:31.261
So do we.

40:31.412 --> 40:34.079
We do, and we will, Daddy.

40:34.157 --> 40:36.582
-(Charlie coos)
-Oh, now look at you.

40:36.643 --> 40:39.060
(laughs) Look...

40:40.939 --> 40:42.480
How you been, baby?

40:45.001 --> 40:46.109
Valerian root.

40:46.260 --> 40:48.686
Natural stress
and anxiety reducer.

40:48.838 --> 40:50.947
Thank you.

40:51.098 --> 40:52.615
Don't suppose
you have anything for guilt?

40:52.767 --> 40:56.027
You have absolutely
nothing to feel guilty about.

40:56.604 --> 41:00.123
The last conversation
I had with Brett...

41:01.626 --> 41:02.850
was a fight.

41:02.869 --> 41:04.335
A bad one.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.045
What about?

41:06.948 --> 41:08.206
You.

41:08.282 --> 41:09.040
Oh.

41:09.192 --> 41:10.858
He could tell I was upset

41:10.877 --> 41:12.117
after you broke up with me

41:12.137 --> 41:14.712
and he started picking at me.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.547
I should have just let it go,

41:16.700 --> 41:19.517
but... he got under my skin.

41:21.221 --> 41:23.554
He had a superpower
for that, you know?

41:24.207 --> 41:26.566
Yeah, I saw some of that
at the firehouse.

41:27.393 --> 41:29.486
And then things just got worse.

41:30.471 --> 41:34.532
We said such hurtful,
nasty things to each other.

41:35.476 --> 41:37.068
Saying hurtful
and nasty things

41:37.144 --> 41:39.245
is what
married couples do best.

41:40.481 --> 41:42.665
Take it from me,
I've been divorced twice.

41:43.576 --> 41:44.501
Owen...

41:45.895 --> 41:47.337
in that moment...

41:49.174 --> 41:52.091
I truly wished
he would just die.

41:52.994 --> 41:54.636
Okay, but you didn't mean it.

41:55.997 --> 41:57.588
The last thing
I said to him was,

41:57.741 --> 41:59.516
"I hope you freeze to death."

41:59.667 --> 42:02.501
Did-did I somehow
will this into happening?

42:02.521 --> 42:03.520
Kendra.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.838
It was a freak accident.

42:06.416 --> 42:08.583
In no way, shape, or form

42:09.010 --> 42:11.027
do you have any
fault in this, okay?

42:12.272 --> 42:13.104
Okay.

42:13.256 --> 42:14.772
(cell phone vibrating)

42:14.924 --> 42:16.866
Okay.

42:16.943 --> 42:18.593
Hmm. I should
probably take this.

42:18.611 --> 42:19.202
Of course.

42:19.353 --> 42:20.853
Hey, Gabriel. What's up?

42:20.872 --> 42:22.096
Owen, sorry to call so late,

42:22.098 --> 42:23.264
but this couldn't
wait till morning.

42:23.283 --> 42:24.782
I heard that you and your team

42:24.934 --> 42:26.042
responded to a 9-1-1 call

42:26.044 --> 42:27.377
at the Harrington estate today?

42:27.604 --> 42:29.361
Yeah, boy, I've never
seen anything like that.

42:29.455 --> 42:31.881
Well, I'm going to need to
talk to you about that.

42:31.958 --> 42:33.107
Okay. Why?

42:33.126 --> 42:34.458
When a man as
rich and influential

42:34.611 --> 42:36.794
as Brett Harrington
dies suddenly,

42:36.871 --> 42:38.112
questions get asked.

42:38.131 --> 42:39.797
I think he went by Collier.

42:39.799 --> 42:41.057
He did.

42:41.284 --> 42:43.134
But it's the Harrington name
that matters.

42:43.286 --> 42:45.044
Look, are you calling me
because I was there

42:45.121 --> 42:46.470
or because
I was dating the wife?

42:46.623 --> 42:48.231
GABRIEL:
<i> Well, that is</i>
<i> the trouble, Owen.</i>

42:48.308 --> 42:50.291
You're not dating the wife.

42:50.310 --> 42:51.383
You're dating the widow.

42:51.552 --> 42:53.811
<i> And we don't think</i>
<i> it was an accident.</i>

42:53.963 --> 42:55.071
I was there.

42:55.222 --> 42:57.131
GABRIEL:
