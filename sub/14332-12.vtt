09:03.009 --> 09:06.078
- COSMO, WANDA, FIND SPARKY.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.614
- OH, HEY, GUYS.
NACHO?

09:08.681 --> 09:12.451
- SPARKY, YOU HAVE TO SAVE TIMMY
FROM BECOMING ROADKILL!

09:12.518 --> 09:13.853
- TIMMY?
WHERE IS HE?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.588
ALL I SEE IS A CAR
HEADED TOWARD A DOG

09:15.655 --> 09:17.556
THAT LOOKS LIKE COTTON CANDY
THAT POOPS.

09:17.623 --> 09:20.459
- THAT POOPING COTTON CANDY
IS TIMMY!

09:20.526 --> 09:21.727
- WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

09:21.794 --> 09:23.229
I HAVE A FRIEND NAMED TIMMY.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.664
OH, NO, IT'S TIMMY!

09:24.730 --> 09:27.199
- [screams]

09:34.674 --> 09:38.377
- THIS IS WHY
I USUALLY DRIVE STANDING UP.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.049
- TIMMY, ARE YOU OKAY?

09:43.115 --> 09:44.951
AND WHY ARE YOU
A WEIRD, PINK DOG?

09:45.017 --> 09:48.154
- YOU BECOMING HUMAN CAUSED SOME
FREAKY IMBALANCE IN THE UNIVERSE

09:48.220 --> 09:49.755
THAT TURNED ME INTO A DOG.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.158
- BUT I LIKE BEING A DOG.
- REALLY?

09:52.224 --> 09:53.526
- DON'T GET ME WRONG.

09:53.592 --> 09:55.461
I'M TOTALLY ROCKING
THIS HUMAN THING,

09:55.528 --> 09:57.530
BUT WEARING CLOTHES
IS SO UNCOMFORTABLE.

09:57.596 --> 09:59.365
ALSO IT'S APPARENTLY ILLEGAL

09:59.432 --> 10:01.434
FOR A HUMAN TO SNIFF
ANOTHER HUMAN'S BUTT.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.736
ESPECIALLY IF THE OTHER HUMAN
IS THE MAYOR.

10:03.803 --> 10:05.271
- THIS IS GREAT, SPARKY.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.539
NOT THE "SNIFFING THE BUTTS"
THING.

10:06.605 --> 10:07.540
THAT'S GROSS.

10:07.606 --> 10:08.708
BUT THAT YOU LOVE BEING A DOG

10:08.774 --> 10:09.942
MORE THAN BEING HUMAN.

10:10.009 --> 10:10.977
[alarm beeps]
OH, NO!

10:11.043 --> 10:12.411
WE ONLY HAVE 30 SECONDS

10:12.478 --> 10:14.513
TO UNWISH THE WISH,
OR I'LL BE A DOG FOREVER.

10:14.580 --> 10:16.148
- JUST SAY THE WORD, TIMMY.

10:16.215 --> 10:17.650
- I WISH--
[yelps]

10:17.717 --> 10:20.753
- I SAID NO DOGS ALLOWED!

10:20.820 --> 10:21.754
- OH, NO!

10:21.821 --> 10:23.089
TIMMY'S GOTTA MAKE THE WISH

10:23.155 --> 10:25.691
IN 20 SECONDS,
OR HE'LL BE A DOG FOREVER.

10:25.758 --> 10:26.859
- DON'T WORRY, WANDA.

10:26.926 --> 10:29.595
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO.

10:29.662 --> 10:30.830
- THAT'S NOT HELPING!

10:30.896 --> 10:33.666
- IT'S NOT HURTING!

10:33.733 --> 10:36.369
- SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME
HOW TO GET TO THE DRY CLEANERS.

10:36.435 --> 10:38.871
OH, NO, THERE'S
A DINING ROOM TABLE IN THE ROAD.

10:38.938 --> 10:42.208
I'LL SWERVE AND HIT THAT GUY
IN THE COWBOY HAT INSTEAD.

10:42.274 --> 10:43.876
- [screams]

10:43.943 --> 10:47.213
- I WISH SPARKY
WAS A DOG AGAIN.

10:48.581 --> 10:51.517
- WE SURE TURNED THE TABLES
ON THAT SITUATION.

10:51.584 --> 10:52.518
GET IT?

10:52.585 --> 10:54.553
NOW LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.055
- HOW IS THAT HELPING?

10:56.122 --> 10:59.725
- IT'S NOT HURTING.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.727
NOW IT'S HURTING.

11:03.963 --> 11:06.399
- GLAD TO HAVE THINGS
BACK TO NORMAL, SPARKY.

11:06.465 --> 11:08.901
- YEAH, THIS IS HOW THINGS
SHOULD BE, TIMMY.

11:08.968 --> 11:12.538
YOU AS A BOY AND ME
AS YOUR MAGICAL, TALKING DOG.

11:12.605 --> 11:15.107
- WELL, SPORT,
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS WISH

11:15.174 --> 11:18.377
DIDN'T COME BACK TO BITE YOU
IN THE BUTT AFTER ALL.

11:18.444 --> 11:20.146
- UNLIKE NATASHA.

11:20.212 --> 11:23.315
ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE, IT'S TIME
TO GO BACK IN YOUR CAGE.

11:23.382 --> 11:25.651
[yelps]

11:25.718 --> 11:28.521
- OOH, A SHINY NEW ALLIGATOR
SNAPPING TURTLE!

11:28.587 --> 11:29.655
- [growls]

11:29.722 --> 11:30.790
- I CAN THROW THIS
AT DINKLEBERG.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.858
[chomping]
OW, MY THUMB!

11:47.506 --> 11:48.707
[bell rings]

11:48.774 --> 11:50.342
- LISTEN UP,
MY LITTLE BEASTS OF BURDEN.

11:50.409 --> 11:52.478
JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOU'RE
THE BEASTS AND THE BURDEN.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.080
IT'S TIME FOR SHOW-AND-TELL.

11:54.146 --> 11:55.548
- I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW.

11:55.614 --> 11:58.084
IT'S A PRICELESS VASE
MY DAD BOUGHT IN CHINA.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.619
- CAN IT, CONVENIENTLY NAMED
BEATRICE BURDEN!

12:00.686 --> 12:02.922
THIS IS MY SHOW AND MY TELL!

12:02.988 --> 12:06.425
BEHOLD MY NEW FAIRY CATCHING
DEVICE, THE CROCK DUSTER!

12:06.492 --> 12:08.894
IT GRINDS FAIRIES
INTO MAGICAL FAIRY DUST,

12:08.961 --> 12:10.496
WHICH I CAN THEN USE ON MYSELF

12:10.563 --> 12:14.567
WITH THIS VERY MASCULINE
POWDER PUFF.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.869
[all sneeze]

12:16.936 --> 12:19.004
- WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME,
MR. CROCKER?

12:19.071 --> 12:20.172
I DON'T HAVE FAIRIES.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.574
- DON'T LIE TO ME!

12:21.640 --> 12:23.109
AS SURE
AS YOU HAVE SNEEZING PENCILS,

12:23.175 --> 12:25.845
I'LL FIND YOUR FAIRIES
WHO ARE CLEARLY NOT HERE.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.614
AND WHEN I DO...

12:28.681 --> 12:30.015
[all whimper]

12:30.082 --> 12:32.451
[cackles]

12:32.518 --> 12:35.054
[screams]

12:35.121 --> 12:36.322
[horn honks]

12:36.388 --> 12:39.525
WHO REDIRECTED TRAFFIC
INTO THE HALLWAY?

12:42.862 --> 12:45.297
- MAN, MR. CROCKER
JUST NEVER GIVES UP.

12:45.364 --> 12:48.501
- TIMMY, FROM NOW ON, YOU SHOULD
MAKE YOUR WISHES AT HOME

12:48.567 --> 12:50.169
WHEN YOU KNOW IT'S SAFE.

12:50.236 --> 12:52.104
- I HATE BRUSHING MY TEETH.

12:52.171 --> 12:54.273
I WISH I NEVER HAD TO DO IT.

12:54.340 --> 12:55.875
- AHA!
- [screams]

12:55.941 --> 12:58.277
- SORRY TO MAKE
SUCH A SPLASH, TURNER,

12:58.344 --> 13:00.880
BUT WERE YOU JUST MAKING
A WISH TO YOUR FAIRIES?

13:00.946 --> 13:03.182
[toilet flushes]
YOU CAN'T GET RID OF ME!

13:03.249 --> 13:04.884
I SURVIVED
THE GREAT HALLWAY BUS CRASH

13:04.950 --> 13:06.552
OF 10:30 THIS MORNING!

13:06.619 --> 13:09.021
FUN FACT: IN TASMANIA, I'D BE
SPINNING THE OTHER DIRECTION.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.690
- DAD, THE TOILET'S
FULL OF CROCKER!

13:11.757 --> 13:13.392
- LUCKY FOR YOU,
I HAPPENED TO BE CROUCHED

13:13.459 --> 13:15.294
OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR
WITH A PLUNGER.

13:15.361 --> 13:18.597
- [groans]

13:18.664 --> 13:21.400
[screams]
[toilet flushes]

13:21.467 --> 13:23.502
- MR. CROCKER'S
DRIVING ME CRAZY.

13:23.569 --> 13:25.738
AT LEAST HE'S FINALLY GONE.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.273
- SLEEP TIGHT, TURNER.

13:27.339 --> 13:29.074
DON'T LET THE BEDBUGS
GET YOUR FAIRIES!

13:29.141 --> 13:30.409
- [screams]

13:30.476 --> 13:32.912
DAD, THERE'S A GIANT CROCKEROACH
IN MY BED!

13:32.978 --> 13:34.980
- LUCKY FOR YOU, I WAS CROUCHED
OUTSIDE YOUR DOOR

13:35.047 --> 13:36.115
WITH A BEDBUG BAT!

13:36.182 --> 13:37.349
I GOT THIS
WHEN I PLAYED BASEBALL

13:37.416 --> 13:38.684
FOR THE DIMMSDALE BEDBUGS.

13:38.751 --> 13:39.785
[heroic music]

13:39.852 --> 13:44.056
- [screams]

13:44.123 --> 13:47.927
- OOH, JUDGING FROM ITS LADY
SCREAMS, THIS IS A FEMALE BUG.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.629
I'M GONNA DRAG IT DOWNSTAIRS
AND HIT IT IN THE EGG SACK.

13:50.696 --> 13:51.897
- NOT THE EGG SACK!

13:51.964 --> 13:53.332
- THAT'S IT!

13:53.399 --> 13:55.534
I CAN'T TAKE MR. CROCKER
WATCHING OVER MY SHOULDER

13:55.601 --> 13:56.769
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

13:56.835 --> 13:58.904
I WISH
HE WOULD JUST DISAPPEAR.

13:58.971 --> 14:00.539
- WHOA, SPORT.

14:00.606 --> 14:03.075
DON'T YOU THINK THAT WISH
MIGHT BE A LITTLE DRASTIC?

14:03.142 --> 14:04.176
- DRASTIC?

14:04.243 --> 14:05.678
DID YOU FORGET
THAT MR. CROCKER

14:05.744 --> 14:06.845
WANTS TO TURN YOU TO DUST

14:06.912 --> 14:08.581
AND USE YOU TO POWDER
HIS NOSE, WOMAN?

14:08.647 --> 14:09.582
- POINT TAKEN.

14:09.648 --> 14:12.551
ADIOS, MR. CROCKER.

14:12.618 --> 14:15.454
- TURNER CAN'T HIDE
HIS FAIRIES FROM ME FOREVER!

14:15.521 --> 14:18.924
ONE DAY, WHEN HE LEAST EXPECTS
IT, I'LL SNEAK UP BEHIND HIM

14:18.991 --> 14:21.860
AND WHAM!
[screams]

14:21.927 --> 14:23.963
[grunts]
ARE YOU BLIND?

14:24.029 --> 14:25.598
I'M WEARING
A BRIGHT RED BUG COSTUME--

14:25.664 --> 14:27.600
[screaming]

14:30.236 --> 14:35.207
[all cheering]

14:35.274 --> 14:37.509
I HATE SPORTS.

14:37.576 --> 14:38.811
[bell rings]

14:38.877 --> 14:39.979
- GOOD NEWS, EVERYONE.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.914
I'VE GOT A HUNCH
STUPID MR. CROCKER

14:41.981 --> 14:43.582
WON'T EVER COME
TO CLASS AGAIN.

14:43.649 --> 14:45.184
- I'VE GOT A HUNCH TOO,
TURNER.

14:45.251 --> 14:46.485
AND I'M RIGHT HERE!

14:46.552 --> 14:48.587
- [screams]
WHAT?

14:48.654 --> 14:51.123
I HEAR MR. CROCKER,
BUT I DON'T SEE HIM.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.157
- WEIRD.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.392
I'VE HAD PEOPLE IGNORE ME

14:53.459 --> 14:55.127
BUT NEVER SAY
THEY CAN'T SEE ME.

14:55.194 --> 14:56.495
OH, WELL.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.098
GUESS WHAT.
I'VE GOT "F"s FOR ALL OF YOU!

14:59.164 --> 15:01.300
[all scream]

15:01.367 --> 15:03.002
HEY, GET BACK IN HERE.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.739
IT'S NO FUN PASSING OUT "F"s
WHEN I CAN'T SEE YOU CRY.

15:06.805 --> 15:08.807
WHERE'S MY REFLECTION?

15:08.874 --> 15:09.808
[screams]

15:09.875 --> 15:10.843
I'M INVISIBLE.

15:10.909 --> 15:11.977
NO WONDER MOTHER FREAKED OUT

15:12.044 --> 15:13.012
WHEN I HUGGED HER GOOD NIGHT.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.680
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME, TURNER?

15:14.747 --> 15:17.783
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU AND
YOUR FAIRIES WERE BEHIND THIS.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.852
WELL, THE JOKE'S ON YOU.

15:19.918 --> 15:23.355
NOW I CAN CAPTURE YOUR FAIRIES,
AND YOU WON'T SEE ME COMING.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.924
[cackles]

15:25.991 --> 15:29.395
- [screams]

15:29.461 --> 15:32.164
- [cackles]

15:32.231 --> 15:33.699
[screams]
[horn blows]

15:33.766 --> 15:37.269
WHO REROUTED THE TRAIN
TO THE HALLWAY?

15:37.336 --> 15:39.338
- [screams]

15:39.405 --> 15:42.207
GUYS, YOU DIDN'T MAKE
MR. CROCKER DISAPPEAR.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.776
YOU JUST MADE HIM INVISIBLE.

15:43.842 --> 15:45.344
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,

15:45.411 --> 15:47.680
"WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY,
THE MICE WILL PLAY."

15:47.746 --> 15:49.515
- WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

15:49.581 --> 15:50.816
- I DON'T KNOW, TIMMY.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.284
YOU'D HAVE TO ASK
THE PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT.

15:52.351 --> 15:53.285
OR THE MICE.

15:53.352 --> 15:54.286
YOU CAN'T ASK THE CAT

15:54.353 --> 15:56.822
'CAUSE HE'S AWAY.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.825
- [grunts]

16:03.162 --> 16:05.464
OKAY, THAT SHOULD
KEEP MR. CROCKER OUT.

16:05.531 --> 16:08.033
NOW I CAN MAKE A WISH
TO TURN HIM BACK TO NORMAL.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.136
- OH, SORRY, TIMMY,
BUT ACCORDING TO THE RULES,

16:11.203 --> 16:14.306
FAIRY MAGIC DOESN'T WORK
ON INVISIBLE TEACHERS.

16:14.373 --> 16:15.541
- SAY WHAT NOW?

16:15.607 --> 16:16.875
- WANDA'S RIGHT.

16:16.942 --> 16:18.577
IT ALSO DOESN'T WORK
ON SLEEPING CLOWNS,

16:18.644 --> 16:20.079
FRENCH NEW WAVE FILMMAKERS,

16:20.145 --> 16:22.214
AND PEOPLE WHO WEAR CLEAR
GLASSES AS A FASHION STATEMENT.

16:22.281 --> 16:24.316
OF COURSE,
NOTHING WORKS ON THEM.

16:24.383 --> 16:25.951
THEY'RE A LOST CAUSE.

16:26.018 --> 16:27.853
- IN ORDER
FOR OUR MAGIC TO WORK,

16:27.920 --> 16:30.222
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO SEE MR. CROCKER.

16:30.289 --> 16:31.857
- THEN I KNOW
JUST WHAT TO DO.

16:31.924 --> 16:34.393
IN THE MEANTIME, I CAN'T RISK
MR. CROCKER SEEING YOU GUYS.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.395
SO HIDE IN THE FISH BOWL.

16:36.462 --> 16:38.330
- GREAT IDEA, TIMMY.

16:38.397 --> 16:41.200
NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE US
IN A CLEAR, GLASS BOWL.

16:41.266 --> 16:44.536
- OH, DELICIOUS, DINOSAUR-SHAPED
CHICKEN NUGGETS.

16:44.603 --> 16:48.774
THESE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN
CHICKEN-SHAPED DINOSAUR NUGGETS.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.243
- PLEASE DROP ONE,
PLEASE DROP ONE.

16:51.310 --> 16:54.913
- [chuckles]

16:54.980 --> 16:56.849
NOW TO FIND TURNER'S FAIRIES!

16:56.915 --> 16:59.251
[sniffs]
OOH, CHICKEN NUGGETS.

16:59.318 --> 17:00.686
MOTHER NEVER LETS ME
HAVE THOSE.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.321
NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE HIGH
IN CHOLESTEROL,

17:02.388 --> 17:05.223
BUT BECAUSE SHE'S THE ENEMY
OF JOY!

17:05.290 --> 17:06.791
[laughing]

17:06.858 --> 17:07.960
- [confused grunt]

17:08.026 --> 17:09.395
- [chomping]

17:09.461 --> 17:10.628
- OH, NO.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.232
MY HOUSE IS HAUNTED
BY A POULTRYGEIST.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.233
- PLEASE DROP ONE.
PLEASE DROP ONE.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.935
- [gasps]
YOU CAN TALK?

17:17.002 --> 17:21.440
- NO, YOU'RE JUST HYSTERICAL
FROM HAVING SEEN A GHOST.

17:21.507 --> 17:23.474
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT HYSTERICAL,

17:23.541 --> 17:26.310
BUT I HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO TELL AN
AMUSING ANECDOTE NOW AND THEN.

17:26.377 --> 17:29.281
- BOO!
I'M A THIRSTY POULTRYGEIST.

17:29.348 --> 17:33.419
GIVE ME ROOT BEER, WHICH MOTHER
ALSO NEVER LETS ME HAVE.

17:33.485 --> 17:35.320
- WHATEVER YOU SAY, MR. GHOST.

17:35.387 --> 17:36.789
- OH, GLORIOUS ROOT BEER!

17:36.855 --> 17:38.590
FIZZY, CARAMEL-COLORED JOY
IN A CAN.

17:38.657 --> 17:40.025
[gulps and belches]

17:40.092 --> 17:41.894
- YOU'RE WEIRD, MR. GHOST.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.829
I'M GUESSING
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE MISS YOU.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.798
- OKAY, GUYS,
HAVE YOUR WANDS READY.

17:45.864 --> 17:49.001
I'M GONNA SPILL PAINT ONTO
MR. CROCKER TO MAKE HIM VISIBLE.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.904
BOY, I REALLY,
REALLY HOPE MR. CROCKER

17:51.970 --> 17:55.841
DOESN'T CATCH ME
TALKING TO MY FAIRIES.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.276
- NEED SOME HELP, TIMMY?

17:57.342 --> 18:00.279
- [yelps]
- [chomping]

18:00.345 --> 18:02.948
TIMMY, I BROUGHT YOU
SOME TASMANIAN DEVILED EGGS.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.883
FUN FACT: IN TASMANIA,

18:04.950 --> 18:07.453
TASMANIAN FOOD
IS JUST CALLED "FOOD."

18:09.488 --> 18:11.457
- OKAY, THIS PLAN HAS TO WORK.

18:11.523 --> 18:13.992
ALL I NEED IS FOR MR. CROCKER
TO TAKE THE BAIT.

18:14.059 --> 18:16.528
WHEN HE GOES FOR THOSE CARDBOARD
CUTOUTS OF YOU GUYS,

18:16.595 --> 18:17.996
HE'LL TRIP ON THIS ROPE

18:18.063 --> 18:19.998
AND FALL INTO THE MUD PIT
I HID UNDER THOSE LEAVES.

18:20.065 --> 18:22.334
- UM, WHICH CUTOUT IS ME?

18:22.401 --> 18:23.335
- THE ONE ON THE LEFT.

18:23.402 --> 18:24.470
- THAT LOOKS LIKE POOF.

18:24.536 --> 18:26.138
- THE ONE ON THE RIGHT IS POOF.

18:26.205 --> 18:28.307
- REALLY?
I THOUGHT THAT WAS ME.

18:28.373 --> 18:30.342
- OH, COME ON!

18:30.409 --> 18:31.443
- DON'T WORRY, TIMMY.

18:31.510 --> 18:32.845
FOR EMERGENCIES LIKE THIS,

18:32.911 --> 18:36.782
WE ALWAYS CARRY CARDBOARD
CUTOUTS OF OURSELVES.

18:38.383 --> 18:39.318
- FINE.

18:39.384 --> 18:43.088
I'LL USE THESE.

18:43.155 --> 18:47.526
[screams]

18:47.593 --> 18:48.694
- ♪ I HOPE
I GOT THE FAIRIES ♪

18:53.165 --> 18:55.167
HA, I GOT THE FAIRIES!

18:55.234 --> 18:57.569
HMM, THEY'RE A LOT FLATTER
THAN I THOUGHT THEY'D BE.

18:57.636 --> 19:01.406
GRANT MY EVERY WISH!
[groans]

19:01.473 --> 19:05.410
STOP STARING AT ME
WITH THOSE BLANK, DEAD EYES.

19:08.146 --> 19:11.517
- OKAY, SPARKY, I BUILT AN ALTAR
OF CEREMONIAL DIPPING SAUCES

19:11.583 --> 19:12.851
TO APPEASE THE POULTRYGEIST.

19:12.918 --> 19:15.654
BUT FIRST,
LET'S DO A TASTE TEST.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.924
MMM, DELICIOUS.

19:18.991 --> 19:19.925
FORGET THE GHOST.

19:19.992 --> 19:23.128
I'M NOT SHARING.

19:23.195 --> 19:25.764
- PLEASE DROP ONE.
PLEASE DROP ONE.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.599
- GUYS, THIS ISN'T WORKING.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.269
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY
TO MAKE MR. CROCKER VISIBLE

19:30.335 --> 19:31.403
BEFORE HE FINDS YOU.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.272
- [cackles]
- WHAT? NO!

19:33.338 --> 19:34.706
- BUSTED, TURNER!

19:34.773 --> 19:36.441
WHEN THOSE FAKE FAIRIES
GAVE ME A PAPER CUT,

19:36.508 --> 19:37.943
I REALIZED I'D BEEN HAD.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.845
THEN I SAW YOU TALKING
TO YOUR FISHBOWL

19:39.912 --> 19:41.446
AND CONCLUDED ONE THING.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.915
YOUR FAIRIES ARE IN THERE!

19:42.981 --> 19:44.950
PROBABLY HIDING
BEHIND THOSE STUPID FISH.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.719
- GIVE ME BACK MY FISH,
YOU INVISIBLE NUT JOB!

19:47.786 --> 19:49.187
- NICE TRY.

19:49.254 --> 19:50.722
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

19:50.789 --> 19:54.359
I'M GONNA THROW THIS FISH BOWL
INTO MY CROCK DUSTER.

19:54.426 --> 19:55.360
- OH, NO.

19:55.427 --> 19:58.263
I GOTTA GET MY FAIRIES BACK.

19:58.330 --> 20:01.266
- [cackles]
- [yelps]

20:01.333 --> 20:02.968
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

20:03.035 --> 20:06.572
- UH, YOUR DAD MAY OR MAY NOT
HAVE DROPPED SOME DIPPING SAUCE

20:06.638 --> 20:08.774
WHEN I MAY OR MAY NOT
HAVE POUNCED ON HIM

20:08.840 --> 20:10.142
TO GET SOME CHICKEN NUGGETS.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.844
- UGH, THAT SAUCE
IS SO STICKY.

20:12.911 --> 20:14.513
WAIT, THAT'S IT!

20:14.580 --> 20:17.082
I THINK I KNOW HOW TO MAKE
MR. CROCKER VISIBLE.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.317
- GREAT.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.885
YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE
A LARGE DIET SODA?

20:19.952 --> 20:21.219
I'M KINDA PARCHED
FROM THE CHICKEN NUGGETS

20:21.286 --> 20:22.354
THAT I DIDN'T STEAL.

20:22.421 --> 20:24.723
- AT LAST,
YOU FAIRIES ARE MINE!

20:24.790 --> 20:25.991
SOON I'LL HAVE
YOUR MAGICAL POWER

20:26.058 --> 20:27.993
IN A MANLY POWDER PUFF FORM.

[cackles]

20:29.227 --> 20:30.495
[all scream]

20:30.562 --> 20:33.065
- WOW, MR. CROCKER
SHOULD BE A VENTRILOQUIST,

20:33.131 --> 20:35.500
'CAUSE WHEN HE TALKS,
I CAN'T SEE HIS LIPS MOVE.

OH, MAYBE
I'LL HAVE ONE LAST BITE

20:41.340 --> 20:45.277
BEFORE YOU FAIRIES BITE
THE DUST, LITERALLY!

20:48.380 --> 20:50.382
OOH, THESE ARE SHAPED
LIKE LITTLE STARS.

20:50.449 --> 20:52.317
MOTHER NEVER LETS ME
LOOK AT THE STARS EITHER.

20:52.384 --> 20:53.952
SHE'S AFRAID
I MIGHT WISH UPON ONE!

21:05.998 --> 21:07.265

21:07.332 --> 21:11.503
I WISH MR. CROCKER
WAS VISIBLE AGAIN.

21:14.506 --> 21:15.440

21:15.507 --> 21:17.376

21:17.442 --> 21:19.845
NOW I CAN FINALLY USE
MY GHOST CHICKEN BAT!

21:19.911 --> 21:22.214
I ALSO PLAYED BASEBALL FOR
THE DIMMSDALE GHOST CHICKENS.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.693
TO SEEING MR. CROCKER AGAIN,

21:34.760 --> 21:38.330
BUT AT LEAST
I STILL GET TO SEE YOU GUYS.

21:38.397 --> 21:39.464
- SORRY I'M LATE.

21:39.531 --> 21:40.799
NO POINT IN GETTING
DRESSED ANYMORE

21:40.866 --> 21:43.001
WHEN YOU'RE INVISIBLE.

THE DIMMSDALE 500

22:08.493 --> 22:09.861
IS JUST CALLED THE 500.
