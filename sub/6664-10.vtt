Adult adam:
<i> If being sentimental</i>
<i> were a sport,</i>

00:02.169 --> 00:02.968
<i> My mom would've gone pro.</i>

00:02.970 --> 00:05.404
<i> Each moment of our lives</i>
<i> was documented, decorated,</i>

00:05.406 --> 00:11.110
<i> And preserved forever</i>
<i> in one of her many</i>
<i> creepy scrapbooks.</i>

00:11.644 --> 00:13.078
Aw. (chuckles)

00:13.080 --> 00:15.180
His little body's changing.

00:15.182 --> 00:18.584
You said that was
to show the
dermatologist!

00:18.586 --> 00:19.284
Lies!

00:19.286 --> 00:20.853
<i> My dad,</i>
<i> on the other hand,</i>

00:20.855 --> 00:23.622
<i> Wasn't quite</i>
<i> as sentimental about us.</i>

00:24.257 --> 00:24.757
Bye, dad.

00:24.759 --> 00:27.359
Have fun at camp
or college or

00:27.361 --> 00:29.995
Wherever it is
you're going.

00:30.330 --> 00:30.929
<i> It drove him crazy</i>

00:30.931 --> 00:32.731
<i> That my mom</i>
<i> would commandeer</i>
<i> the garage</i>

00:32.733 --> 00:34.666
<i> To obsessively save</i>
<i> every little piece</i>
<i> of artwork,</i>

00:34.668 --> 00:37.569
<i> Doodle, and drawing</i>
<i> that we have ever done.</i>

00:37.571 --> 00:39.304
(sighs heavily)

00:40.306 --> 00:44.176
<i> It accrued slowly</i>
<i> over time until</i>
<i> that fateful day</i>

00:44.178 --> 00:47.413
<i> Of the great</i>
<i> goldberg avalanche.</i>

00:47.415 --> 00:49.348
Aah!

00:49.482 --> 00:51.683
Are you kidding me?

00:51.685 --> 00:53.552
Oh! Damn it!

00:53.554 --> 00:54.586
Help!

00:54.588 --> 00:56.688
(horn honking)
bevy!

00:56.690 --> 00:58.857
I could've been killed!

00:58.859 --> 01:00.526
Oh, poop!

01:00.528 --> 01:05.397
You ruined adam's
jelly bean diorama
of custer's last stand.

01:05.399 --> 01:05.898
Poopies!

01:05.900 --> 01:08.100
That's it. I'm cleaning
this whole place out.

01:08.102 --> 01:11.870
No! Where am I gonna hide
my six-pack of...Homework.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.806
And the magazines
I'm holding for a friend.

01:13.808 --> 01:17.443
Hide it in the woods
like every other kid!

01:17.445 --> 01:20.712
All this crap
has got to go!

01:20.714 --> 01:21.547
It's not crap.

01:21.549 --> 01:24.983
Every box is filled
with priceless
family memories,

01:24.985 --> 01:26.852
Each one more
valuable than
the next.

01:26.854 --> 01:30.823
Bevy, we are drowning
in our children's
art projects.

01:30.825 --> 01:34.660
You have literally
kept every drawing,
every doodle,

01:34.662 --> 01:37.329
Every macaroni necklace
they have ever made.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.031
Did you know that
albert einstein's

01:39.033 --> 01:44.870
First macaroni necklace
just sold for over $1 million?

01:44.872 --> 01:46.238
Einstein, huh?

01:46.240 --> 01:48.440
Which child would that be?

01:48.442 --> 01:49.575
Hey, bar?

01:49.577 --> 01:50.776
Ugh!

01:50.778 --> 01:51.743
Ew!

01:51.745 --> 01:53.078
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:53.080 --> 01:56.982
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

01:59.185 --> 02:00.486
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:00.488 --> 02:04.089
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:04.091 --> 02:06.625
Adult adam:
<i> It was January 7,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

02:06.627 --> 02:09.828
<i> And erica was finding</i>
<i> a new and exciting way</i>
<i> to torture us.</i>

02:09.830 --> 02:12.865
Ha! Look,
it's barry's
baby helmet.

02:12.867 --> 02:15.534
No! I thought we gave
that back to the institute.

02:15.536 --> 02:18.070
You were so cute
with your little flat head.

02:18.072 --> 02:19.371
I used to rest
my kool-aid on you.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.340
Well, my head's
perfectly round now.

02:21.342 --> 02:25.511
Oh, my gosh.
It's a picture of you
all helmeted up.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.312
This is gonna look
great in the yearbook.

02:27.314 --> 02:27.980
No, please, show mercy.

02:27.982 --> 02:31.183
Adult adam: <i> Yep, my sister</i>
<i> had a gift for making</i>
<i> our lives a living hell.</i>

02:31.185 --> 02:34.419
<i> The more public</i>
<i> the humiliation,</i>
<i> the better.</i>

02:34.421 --> 02:36.555
Hey!
(giggles)

02:36.557 --> 02:37.022
Why?

02:37.024 --> 02:40.025
You wore tear-away pants.
This is on you.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.227
(sing-songy) hey, adam.

02:42.229 --> 02:42.995
Oh, balls!

02:42.997 --> 02:43.962
It's your potty pal,
remember?

02:43.964 --> 02:48.066
Mom bought him for you
because you thought
monsters lived in the toilet.

02:48.068 --> 02:50.169
They weren't monsters!

02:50.171 --> 02:51.036
They were toilet trolls.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.805
(baby voice) aw, is pudgy
wittle adam still too scared

02:53.807 --> 02:54.706
To make
poo-poos now, huh?

02:54.708 --> 02:58.043
Oh, like you're
so perfect
with all your...

02:58.045 --> 02:59.278
Your trophies.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.412
And your "a" papers,

03:00.414 --> 03:03.749
And your...
Your framed commendation
from the mayor?

03:03.751 --> 03:05.417
Seriously?
Yeah, nice try.

03:05.419 --> 03:09.721
Well, let's see what
treasures lie in this box.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.291
Nothing to see here,
bye-bye.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:14.962 --> 03:18.330
It's an old box
of your new kids
on the block stuff.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.164
You still love them.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.733
(scoffs) no,
I'm way too old
to like boy bands.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.135
Then I'll throw
them away for you.

03:23.137 --> 03:24.436
No! Don't touch them!
They're mine!

03:24.438 --> 03:27.472
Adult adam: <i> Yep, long before</i>
<i> one direction and 'n sync,</i>

03:27.474 --> 03:29.408
<i> There was</i>
<i> the original boy band...</i>

03:29.410 --> 03:30.142
<i> New kids on the block.</i>

03:30.144 --> 03:31.443
You still love the new kids.
You're lame.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.711
You love 'em.
You're so lame.

03:32.713 --> 03:36.148
No, you guys are
lame sacks of...

03:36.150 --> 03:37.516
Just shut up!

03:37.518 --> 03:39.051
Damn it!

03:39.053 --> 03:40.886
She got away
with all our ammo!

03:40.888 --> 03:41.954
Not all of it.

03:41.956 --> 03:43.322
How?
Sleight of hand.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.224
And you thought
magic camp
was for dorks.

03:45.226 --> 03:47.259
I still do,
but good work.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.228
<i> After years</i>
<i> of one-sided torture,</i>

03:49.230 --> 03:50.996
<i> We finally</i>
<i> got some ammo.</i>

03:50.998 --> 03:51.597
<i> Oh, hey, guys.</i>

03:51.599 --> 03:53.665
Adult adam: <i> And it would</i>
<i> change everything.</i>

03:53.667 --> 03:56.368
<i> It's erica goldberg,</i>
<i> your number one fan.</i>

03:56.370 --> 03:59.238
(laughs) <i> and I wanted</i>
<i> to make this video</i>

03:59.240 --> 04:02.441
<i> So that you could see</i>
<i> firsthand how much</i>
<i> I love you</i>

04:02.443 --> 04:04.676
<i> And wanna marry you.</i>
(giggles)

04:04.678 --> 04:08.080
<i> But not all of you.</i>
<i> Just you, jonathan.</i>

04:08.082 --> 04:10.349
<i> In fact,</i>
<i> I wrote a song</i>
<i> about you.</i>

04:10.351 --> 04:13.418
<i> So I'm gonna...</i>
<i> I'm gonna sing it for you.</i>

04:13.420 --> 04:15.120
<i> ¶ jonny</i>

04:15.122 --> 04:17.689
<i> ¶ jonny, jonny</i>

04:17.824 --> 04:19.691
<i> ¶ I love you ¶</i>

04:19.693 --> 04:20.692
(sobbing)

04:20.694 --> 04:23.695
<i> I love you so much!</i>
(sobbing)

04:23.697 --> 04:25.664
<i> I do! I... I love you!</i>

04:25.666 --> 04:27.332
<i> ¶ I love you ¶</i>

04:27.334 --> 04:30.269
(high-pitched voice)
<i> I love you so much!</i>

04:30.271 --> 04:33.572
I always knew one day
a good thing would
happen to me.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.741
And that day is now.
<i> I love you so much!</i>

04:35.743 --> 04:37.142
Do you know what
this means?

04:37.144 --> 04:40.112
Her reign of terror
is finally over.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.180
And we must
annihilate her.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.015
Absolutely.

04:43.017 --> 04:46.218
Don't steeple your fingers.
I'm steepling mine!

04:46.220 --> 04:47.152
We can't both do it.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.688
If anybody should be
steepling, it should be me.

04:49.690 --> 04:50.522
Your fingers are weird.
What?

04:50.524 --> 04:53.158
No, they're not.
What are you
talking about?

04:53.160 --> 04:57.229
How's that weird?
How can you say that
with a straight face?

04:57.597 --> 04:59.398
I don't think
it's that weird, man.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.166
They're like
witch's fingers.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.468
Adult adam: <i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i> my dad had laid down the law.</i>

05:03.470 --> 05:06.938
<i> My mom was allowed to fill</i>
<i> a single trunk with our art.</i>

05:06.940 --> 05:09.441
<i> Sadly, it didn't have</i>
<i> infinite space.</i>

05:09.443 --> 05:12.511
Bevy, we've been
at this for hours.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.112
Please move it along.
Come on.

05:14.114 --> 05:18.417
Oh! Adam's family portrait
from kindergarten.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.351
I gotta keep this.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.787
What are we, a family
of potatoes? Toss it.

05:21.789 --> 05:25.090
All right, fine, but you
can't expect me
to get rid of this.

05:25.092 --> 05:28.360
Oh, yes, I can.
It's a turkey.
We get it.

05:28.362 --> 05:31.063
It's his little hand
preserved forever.

05:31.065 --> 05:31.963
He still has a hand!

05:31.965 --> 05:35.701
Adam! Come down here
and show your
mother your hand!

05:35.703 --> 05:39.371
Oh, now it's all...
Huge and gangly.

05:39.373 --> 05:42.040
Don't you just
miss those pudgy
little baby hands?

05:42.042 --> 05:45.077
It's just
a crappy turkey.
Toss it!

05:45.079 --> 05:48.747
And toss the blue banana
and the dog with six legs!

05:48.749 --> 05:53.051
Okay, you seriously
can't tell me that
erica's finger painting

05:53.053 --> 05:54.219
Makes you feel nothing.

05:54.221 --> 05:56.855
I feel something...
Confused.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.390
Who the hell's "babby"?

05:58.392 --> 05:59.491
It says "daddy."

05:59.493 --> 06:01.259
She made her little
d's backwards.

06:01.261 --> 06:05.097
You're her "babby."
how do you
not feel anything?

06:05.099 --> 06:07.199
I'll tell you how,
and it's simple.

06:07.201 --> 06:10.836
Our children
are not talented.

06:10.838 --> 06:11.403
You're a monster.

06:11.405 --> 06:15.941
Well, that would explain
why I have three eyes
and lobster hands.

06:15.943 --> 06:16.742
Toss!

06:16.744 --> 06:18.710
Okay, fellas,
it's all gotta go.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.446
Are you sure
bevy's fine with this?

06:21.448 --> 06:23.548
Absolutely.
She's more than fine.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.717
Then why do I feel
her eyes on me

06:25.719 --> 06:28.653
Like a thousand
tiny daggers?

06:31.457 --> 06:33.592
I let her keep
her one trunk.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.626
That's more than fair.

06:34.628 --> 06:37.863
Trust me,
once that stuff's
at the dump,

06:37.865 --> 06:39.331
She'll forget all about it.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.767
All right,
that's everything.

06:41.868 --> 06:42.834
Thank you.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.470
I feel good about this.
Mmm.

06:46.072 --> 06:49.241
Wait, where's the trunk?

06:49.442 --> 06:51.143
Hey, wait!
Hey, hold on!

06:51.145 --> 06:52.344
Wait, wait!
Stop! Stop!

06:52.346 --> 06:54.713
All right, you run after them,
I'll go get the car keys.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.314
Why do I have to
run after them?

06:56.316 --> 06:58.016
You're spry.
It's your thing.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.652
How 'bout you run,
I get the keys?

07:00.654 --> 07:02.120
You can't drive!

07:02.122 --> 07:03.655
Get off my jock, mur.

07:03.657 --> 07:06.191
I'm making this stuff up
on the fly here.

07:06.193 --> 07:09.528
Fine! We'll both get
the damn keys.

07:11.964 --> 07:14.232
That truck is gone.

07:14.534 --> 07:16.635
Yes... It is.

07:16.637 --> 07:17.936
(laughing)

07:17.938 --> 07:19.337
All: Hey!

07:19.339 --> 07:20.472
Come on in!

07:20.474 --> 07:22.107
We just invited over
a few pals

07:22.109 --> 07:24.576
For a little
video premiere party.
No.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.211
I like it when you said
your hand was jonathan

07:26.213 --> 07:27.679
And then you
made out with it.
(laughing)

07:27.681 --> 07:30.449
No!
Wait, you made fun of me
for my corey feldman shrine,

07:30.451 --> 07:32.350
And all along,
you were doing this?

07:32.352 --> 07:32.951
No!
Yes.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.920
No!
Let's play it again,
shall we?

07:34.922 --> 07:37.622
Stop doing
what you're doing
and turn it off.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.757
Turn it up?
Yeah, you got it.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.325
Turn it off!
Erica: (on tv) <i> I love you!</i>

07:40.327 --> 07:42.461
Barry, the attic!
<i> I love you so much!</i>

07:42.463 --> 07:43.562
Adult adam:
<i> My sister was furious</i>

07:43.564 --> 07:46.431
<i> She had lost all the power,</i>
<i> but not half as mad</i>

07:46.433 --> 07:49.034
<i> As when she saw</i>
<i> what we did to her room.</i>

07:49.036 --> 07:51.069
Ho, ho!

07:54.073 --> 07:56.441
Donald.
Why are you
doing this to me?

07:56.443 --> 08:00.946
We just wanted to
make sure you had...
"the right stuff."

08:00.948 --> 08:03.448
Just take your stupid
flat helmet head

08:03.450 --> 08:04.249
And get out of my room.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.619
Normally, that would
send me into
an emotional tailspin.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.821
But from now on,
no matter what you say,

08:09.823 --> 08:12.157
You're just
a borderline
adult woman

08:12.159 --> 08:13.225
Who likes lame
boy bands.

08:13.227 --> 08:16.261
No! You do not
have the power.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.496
I have the power.

08:17.498 --> 08:18.897
Oh, no.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.665
For years,
our stupid life choices

08:20.667 --> 08:23.301
And physical awkwardness
has given you ammo

08:23.303 --> 08:25.637
To humiliate us,
but no more!

08:25.639 --> 08:27.772
I say, no more!

08:28.975 --> 08:29.741
<i> And just like that,</i>

08:29.743 --> 08:33.778
<i> Erica's childhood dreams</i>
<i> became her adult nightmare.</i>

08:33.780 --> 08:36.248
("you got it
the right stuff" <i> playing)</i>
<i> it had been three days</i>

08:36.250 --> 08:38.850
<i> Since we started</i>
<i> using new kids</i>
<i> to taunt erica.</i>

08:38.852 --> 08:40.919
<i> Unfortunately, all that</i>
<i> musical exposure</i>

08:40.921 --> 08:44.022
<i> Led to some</i>
<i> unintended</i>
<i> consequences.</i>

08:44.024 --> 08:46.525
<i> ¶ first time was a great time</i>
(singing along)

08:46.527 --> 08:48.760
<i> ¶ second time was a blast</i>

08:48.762 --> 08:50.795
<i> ¶ third time I fell in love</i>

08:50.797 --> 08:51.930
<i> ¶ now I hope it lasts</i>

08:51.932 --> 08:53.265
What are you doing?
<i> ¶ I could see it in... ¶</i>

08:53.267 --> 08:56.001
(music stops)
me? Like,
right now? Just...

08:56.003 --> 08:59.571
You know,
bagging on erica
and her stupid music.

08:59.573 --> 09:00.805
By singing along?
Yes!

09:00.807 --> 09:03.241
I mean, how am
I really gonna
torture erica

09:03.243 --> 09:06.244
If I don't know
all the words
to the song?

09:06.246 --> 09:07.512
<i> It was a wobbly</i>
<i> premise at best</i>

09:07.514 --> 09:10.482
<i> And there's</i>
<i> no way he'd buy it.</i>

09:10.484 --> 09:12.384
That's a good point, dude.

09:12.386 --> 09:13.885
It is?
Yeah.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.887
'cause I might've
memorized their
entire album.

09:15.889 --> 09:19.124
Smart!
That'll really
piss her off!

09:19.126 --> 09:21.359
What's your favorite song?
To torture erica with.

09:21.361 --> 09:24.262
That'd be a 10-way tie
between all of them!

09:24.264 --> 09:24.896
Take that, erica!

09:24.898 --> 09:28.199
Can you believe
her favorite new kid
is jonathan knight?

09:28.201 --> 09:30.068
I mean, hello,
he's the shy one.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.805
Yeah, but you put him
on the dance floor,
he blows everyone away.

09:33.807 --> 09:34.372
Of course!

09:34.374 --> 09:36.641
That's why I learned
all of joey mcintyre's
lyrics!

09:36.643 --> 09:38.410
'cause he's like me,
the youngest and the cutest

09:38.412 --> 09:40.078
And always getting
into shenanigans.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.080
Joey? If anything,
you're a jordan.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.381
'cause your voice
is all high

09:43.383 --> 09:44.449
And you're cocky
when you shouldn't be.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.217
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're a danny.

09:46.219 --> 09:49.187
Please. I'm donnie,
the bad boy,
and you know it.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.323
Can you knobs
please keep it down?

09:51.325 --> 09:51.990
I'm trying to study.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.792
Why? You studying
with your boyfriends

09:53.794 --> 09:55.493
Danny, donnie, joey,
jon, jordan?

09:55.495 --> 09:58.163
Gosh, shut up with that!

09:58.165 --> 09:59.764
I have the power!

09:59.766 --> 10:02.334
See? I know at a glance
I have danny aspects,

10:02.336 --> 10:05.837
But donnie has that
roughneck appeal
that ladies love!

10:05.839 --> 10:08.807
Hey, you know what would
totally drive erica nuts?

10:08.809 --> 10:10.241
If we learned
all their dance moves.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.477
Know what else
would really
rub her nose in it?

10:12.479 --> 10:16.448
We do a shot-for-shot
remake of their
music video.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.849
Yes!
(giggles)

10:17.851 --> 10:19.884
<i> ¶ oh, oh, oh-oh-oh ¶</i>

10:19.886 --> 10:21.052
Oh, yeah.
All right.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.488
I'm gonna go cut off
the sleeves of
my jean jacket,

10:23.490 --> 10:24.789
You go gather up
some leather vests,

10:24.791 --> 10:26.658
And that'll really
stick it to her!

10:26.660 --> 10:28.593
<i> While my brother and I</i>
<i> were fooling ourselves,</i>

10:28.595 --> 10:31.196
<i> My dad and pops</i>
<i> were hoping</i>
<i> to fool my mom</i>

10:31.198 --> 10:33.264
<i> By forging</i>
<i> our old artwork</i>
<i> and putting it</i>

10:33.266 --> 10:34.532
<i> In a duplicate trunk.</i>

10:34.534 --> 10:36.301
There you go.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.837
Good as the real thing.

10:38.839 --> 10:39.938
The hell is this?

10:39.940 --> 10:42.073
You said adam
drew a potato family.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.076
Not actual potatoes!
Potato-shaped!

10:45.078 --> 10:46.344
And what are they
doing on a farm?

10:46.346 --> 10:48.413
Where else would
a potato family live?

10:48.415 --> 10:50.515
It's too good!
It's supposed to be awful.

10:50.517 --> 10:53.318
Well, we gotta fill up
this trunk with something,

10:53.320 --> 10:56.354
And all we got is
a few macaroni necklaces,

10:56.356 --> 10:59.824
A blue banana,
and this glittery thing.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.862
It's supposed to say,
"I love you babby." babby!

11:03.864 --> 11:05.430
What the hell is a babby?

11:05.432 --> 11:06.998
I'm the babby!

11:07.000 --> 11:09.401
It's too good.
Do it again,
and do it worse.

11:09.403 --> 11:12.037
Hey, I got talent.
I can't suppress it.

11:12.039 --> 11:15.674
In fact,
if you don't want
my potato family,

11:15.676 --> 11:18.009
Perhaps
"the new yorker" will.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.010
I give up.

11:19.012 --> 11:22.614
There's no way
bevy's gonna
believe this crap.

11:22.616 --> 11:23.381
What are you gonna do?

11:23.383 --> 11:27.485
The only thing I can do...
Come clean and end this.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.521
<i> My dad hoped</i>
<i> she would take it well,</i>

11:29.523 --> 11:31.256
<i> But she didn't.</i>
(sobbing)

11:31.258 --> 11:33.892
Well, on the bright side,
our garage is clean.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.260
(wailing)

11:35.262 --> 11:37.562
(sighs heavily)
okay, you win.

11:37.564 --> 11:41.099
I will never make you
throw anything away again.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.300
Promise?
Yes!

11:42.302 --> 11:45.303
You can hoard whatever crap
you want from now on.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.173
You won't hear so much
as a grumble from me.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.274
Well, that's a start.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.042
(inhales deeply)
now if you'll excuse me,

11:51.044 --> 11:55.680
I need to, uh,
be alone to mourn
the piece of my heart

11:55.682 --> 11:57.749
That died today.

11:59.852 --> 12:04.022
<i> My dad came clean,</i>
<i> but my mom</i>
<i> was playing dirty.</i>

12:04.024 --> 12:05.323
<i> To teach my dad a lesson,</i>

12:05.325 --> 12:08.526
<i> She had paid the haulers</i>
<i> to stash our art here.</i>

12:08.528 --> 12:09.961
Okay, so for
the monthly
storage cost,

12:09.963 --> 12:12.797
I'm gonna need
a credit card.
Mmm, no, no, gabe.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.566
This will be
a strictly cash
transaction.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.735
No paper trail that way.
(chuckles)

12:16.737 --> 12:19.804
Um, that's kind of
weird, but okay.

12:19.806 --> 12:25.043
See, I had all these pieces
of my kids in these boxes,

12:25.045 --> 12:27.612
And someone tried
to take them away from me.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.115
We can't have that,
can we, gabe?

12:30.117 --> 12:33.518
(laughing)
(laughing nervously)

12:33.919 --> 12:37.689
<i> That day,</i>
<i> my mom's guilt trip</i>
<i> worked a little too well.</i>

12:37.691 --> 12:40.125
<i> My dad actually</i>
<i> went down to</i>
<i> the local dump</i>

12:40.127 --> 12:43.128
<i> And searched for our art</i>
<i> with a can-do attitude.</i>

12:43.130 --> 12:44.863
(bleep)

12:47.566 --> 12:51.436
<i> ¶ whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

12:52.705 --> 12:55.340
<i> ¶ oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

12:55.342 --> 12:57.008
Man, look at our moves!

12:57.010 --> 12:57.876
Our lines are so crisp.

12:57.878 --> 13:01.412
<i> ¶ listen up, everybody,</i>
<i> if you wanna take a chance ¶</i>
in your face, erica!

13:01.414 --> 13:03.915
Wait, I'm confused.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.951
How exactly is this
a joke on erica?

13:06.953 --> 13:08.019
Um, earth to chad kremp.

13:08.021 --> 13:11.523
It's called a parody,
like weird al.
Look him up.

13:11.525 --> 13:14.759
But weird al changes
the song into a joke.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.628
This is clearly
a labor of love

13:16.630 --> 13:18.696
Executed by
two super fans.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.598
<i> ¶ hangin' tough ¶</i>

13:20.600 --> 13:22.333
(door creaks)

13:22.335 --> 13:26.104
So, apparently,
that whole revenge plot
on erica?

13:26.106 --> 13:27.772
It took a strange turn.

13:27.774 --> 13:28.473
It seems like it, yes.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.876
You need to destroy
that tape!
For sure.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.111
<i> But I didn't.</i>

13:33.113 --> 13:34.679
<i> That was some</i>
<i> of my best work.</i>

13:34.681 --> 13:35.814
<i> So I hid it</i>
<i> under my bed...</i>

13:35.816 --> 13:38.349
<i> A decision I would</i>
<i> quickly regret.</i>

13:38.351 --> 13:42.020
<i> ¶ listen up, everybody,</i>
<i> if you wanna take a chance</i>

13:42.022 --> 13:43.254
(laughing)

13:43.256 --> 13:47.058
<i> ¶ just get on the floor</i>
<i> and do the new kids dance</i>

13:47.060 --> 13:50.461
(laughing)
<i> ¶ don't worry 'bout nothin' ¶</i>

13:50.463 --> 13:51.529
Hey, come on in.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.165
We're just having a little
video premiere party.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.267
No!
<i> ¶ hangin' tough ¶</i>

13:56.269 --> 13:58.269
Adam, I thought
you destroyed the tape.

13:58.271 --> 14:01.406
I couldn't do it!
Our lines were so crisp.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.741
Dude, this is way worse
than erica's tape

14:03.743 --> 14:05.877
'cause at least
she was, like, young...

14:05.879 --> 14:06.811
And a girl.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.980
I'm sorry, adam,
I didn't wanna watch,

14:08.982 --> 14:10.682
But then
I just couldn't
look away.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.784
We've watched
this video four times.

14:12.786 --> 14:13.785
Boy: We're watching it again!

14:13.787 --> 14:15.620
All: Yes!
<i> ¶ we're rough! ¶</i>

14:15.622 --> 14:17.822
<i> ¶ oh, oh, oh... ¶</i>

14:17.824 --> 14:19.991
(turns off tv)
guys, come on.

14:19.993 --> 14:22.427
You showed that video
to all my friends

14:22.429 --> 14:24.996
And the girl of my dreams?
And my girlfriend!

14:24.998 --> 14:26.164
I can only take
so many hits like that

14:26.166 --> 14:28.867
Before she comes
to her senses
and dumps me.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.034
I mean, you handed
me the ammo.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.236
What did you
expect me to do?

14:31.238 --> 14:33.671
Oh, please!
You've always had the ammo.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.174
'cause we're
the easiest targets
on the planet!

14:36.176 --> 14:38.343
Making fun of adam
for his lazy eye

14:38.345 --> 14:40.879
And his inability
to hit a baseball,

14:40.881 --> 14:41.946
And his stupid haircut.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.715
His bad breath...
Okay, okay, okay.

14:43.717 --> 14:44.549
And then there's me!

14:44.551 --> 14:47.785
Always gunning
for one of my many
awesome qualities

14:47.787 --> 14:48.753
That you feel
threatened by.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.256
Just once
we had the
upper hand.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.024
Oh, I see,
so you can
dish it out,

14:53.026 --> 14:54.225
But you can't take it.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.827
We always take it!

14:55.829 --> 14:58.830
You're our big sister.
You're supposed
to protect us,

14:58.832 --> 15:02.066
But you always just
make things worse.

15:04.103 --> 15:06.304
<i> While my sister was</i>
<i> feeling like garbage,</i>

15:06.306 --> 15:08.473
<i> My dad was still</i>
<i> knee-deep in it.</i>

15:08.475 --> 15:09.207
You gotta be kidding me.

15:09.209 --> 15:14.245
<i> As fate would have it,</i>
<i> he stumbled upon</i>
<i> a box of children's art.</i>

15:14.247 --> 15:17.548
Oh! (laughs) yeah!

15:17.550 --> 15:20.184
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> my dad had</i>
<i> no freaking clue</i>

15:20.186 --> 15:21.019
<i> It wasn't ours.</i>

15:21.021 --> 15:22.687
Whoa, now.
What's happening?

15:22.689 --> 15:26.324
You would not
believe my luck, al.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.392
I went down to the dump,

15:27.394 --> 15:29.794
And I actually found
one of the boxes.

15:29.796 --> 15:30.662
And I had 'em framed.

15:30.664 --> 15:33.431
I really hope that
wasn't expensive.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.566
(lowered voice)
incredibly expensive.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.402
(normal voice)
you know, at first,
I was doing this

15:37.404 --> 15:39.470
So bev wouldn't hold it
over me forever,

15:39.472 --> 15:41.105
But as I look
at my children's art,

15:41.107 --> 15:43.708
I realize I was wrong
to throw it away.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.044
Out of curiosity,
who would this be?

15:46.046 --> 15:49.714
Well, that's, uh, me,
uh, and mr. Chair.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.983
And since when does
mr. Chair have wheels?

15:51.985 --> 15:54.118
And since
when is your
name <i> "abuela"?</i>

15:54.120 --> 15:55.353
What do you
think that means?

15:55.355 --> 15:59.090
It means this is someone's
hispanic wheelchair grandma,

15:59.092 --> 16:03.261
And you've spent a fortune
framing a stranger's art.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.062
Huh.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.764
Also, this call came in.
(beep)

16:06.766 --> 16:08.399
Man: <i> Hey, jenkintown storage.</i>

16:08.401 --> 16:12.003
<i> That larger unit</i>
<i> opened up for your</i>
<i> boxes and your trunk.</i>

16:12.005 --> 16:14.205
<i> Give us a call.</i>
(beep)

16:14.207 --> 16:15.039
(dial tone beeping)
huh.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.041
You know what
I think happened?

16:17.043 --> 16:20.979
I think bevy lied
and made
a fool out of you.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.547
Huh.

16:24.216 --> 16:25.049
Huh.

16:25.051 --> 16:28.386
Adult adam: <i> It had been</i>
<i> two days since erica</i>
<i> outed us as blockheads</i>

16:28.388 --> 16:30.321
<i> And we still weren't</i>
<i> talking to her.</i>

16:30.323 --> 16:32.724
Hey, guys.
Got a couple cold ones.

16:32.726 --> 16:36.227
I decline your hollow peace
offering of an ecto cooler.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.996
And I will take it,
but it changes nothing.

16:37.998 --> 16:41.032
Come on, guys.
You can't give me
the silent treatment forever.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.368
Oh, we can,
and we will.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.570
Too much finger.
Put it down.

16:45.572 --> 16:46.137
Enough, okay?

16:46.139 --> 16:48.306
Brothers and sisters
torture each other.

16:48.308 --> 16:48.973
That's how it works.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.376
If you're so upset
about it, then
just do it back.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.978
We'd like to,
believe me,
but here's the thing...

16:53.980 --> 16:56.848
That new kids ammo
is all we ever
had on you.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.916
Please stop acting
like I'm so perfect.

16:58.918 --> 16:59.851
You saw my video.

16:59.853 --> 17:03.054
I had braces
and glasses
and frizzy hair.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.389
(lisping) look at this!

17:04.391 --> 17:06.057
This is what
braces look like,

17:06.059 --> 17:08.459
Not your cute little
metal ones.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.496
Mine has a chin strap.
A chin strap!

17:11.498 --> 17:14.465
Okay! You're pathetic
fish in a barrel.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.333
What do you want from me?

17:15.335 --> 17:17.468
To stop humiliating
and belittling us.

17:17.470 --> 17:21.105
We're just asking
for basic human decency.

17:21.107 --> 17:22.340
What all men want!

17:22.342 --> 17:25.443
(inhales deeply)
ooh, god. I can't do it.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.012
I'd like to say yes,
but it's impossible.

17:28.014 --> 17:30.815
Right,
'cause you
have the power.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.917
You always have the power.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.819
I hope it feels good.

17:36.922 --> 17:39.123
<i> While erica</i>
<i> was striking out with us,</i>

17:39.125 --> 17:42.493
<i> My dad hoped</i>
<i> to strike back</i>
<i> against my mom.</i>

17:42.495 --> 17:45.296
Oh, wow.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.632
Uh, what's going on here?

17:47.634 --> 17:48.266
Good news, honey.

17:48.268 --> 17:51.803
I just spent six hours
wading through
toxic garbage,

17:51.805 --> 17:54.138
And look,
I found our kids' art!

17:54.140 --> 17:55.873
Great! (chuckles)

17:55.875 --> 17:56.407
You were right.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.976
From now on,
we're keeping
every piece of art

17:58.978 --> 18:03.714
'cause each one
is a masterpiece of love.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.384
You know about
the storage unit.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.819
Of course I know!

18:07.821 --> 18:09.487
You made me go
to the dump!

18:09.489 --> 18:11.255
Well, what was
I supposed to do?

18:11.257 --> 18:13.191
You were gonna
throw it all away.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.093
Secret storage
was my only option.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.929
I just want one room
with my special things.

18:17.931 --> 18:21.165
And now I guess you're gonna
take that away, too, huh?

18:21.167 --> 18:21.899
<i> And that's when my dad</i>

18:21.901 --> 18:24.435
<i> Decided to stop</i>
<i> torturing my mom.</i>

18:24.437 --> 18:26.537
Actually, I already did.

18:26.539 --> 18:30.942
<i> Turns out, my dad was</i>
<i> sentimental after all.</i>

18:30.944 --> 18:32.677
You schlepped it all back?

18:32.679 --> 18:33.511
For me?

18:33.513 --> 18:36.681
Just do me a favor
and try to...

18:36.982 --> 18:39.517
Thin it out a little bit.

18:39.651 --> 18:42.820
But won't you miss
your garage?
Yeah...

18:42.822 --> 18:45.356
But you never know,
one of our morons
can turn out

18:45.358 --> 18:47.458
To be the next einstein.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.727
<i> ¶ the right stuff ¶</i>

18:52.764 --> 18:53.898
Hey, need a ride?

18:53.900 --> 18:57.768
Uh, no.
We're gonna walk,
thanks.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.237
Wait, come on, just...

18:59.239 --> 19:02.206
Come back!
Wow, nice new kids shirt.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.174
You got us good.

19:03.176 --> 19:05.176
I'm not wearing it
to bust on you.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.511
It's an olive branch.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.947
<i> ¶ I could see it in your walk,</i>
<i> tell it when you talk ¶</i>

19:09.949 --> 19:11.949
New kids third row center?

19:11.951 --> 19:13.117
Look, I thought
we could go.

19:13.119 --> 19:16.521
Sure, I'm too old
to like them,
and you're...Dudes,

19:16.523 --> 19:19.724
But everyone has that band
that they listen to in secret.

19:19.726 --> 19:22.994
So why can't we just go
have fun at the concert
and own it?

19:22.996 --> 19:25.096
But... What if someone
sees us there?

19:25.098 --> 19:27.198
I'm your big sister.
I'll protect you.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.501
<i> That was the beginning of</i>
<i> our sister having our back...</i>

19:30.503 --> 19:32.670
<i> When she felt like it.</i>

19:32.672 --> 19:35.273
<i> It was also the beginning</i>
<i> of my mom letting go...</i>

19:35.275 --> 19:38.910
You know, I thought maybe
we should hang this one up.

19:38.912 --> 19:41.546
<i> And my dad learning</i>
<i> the value of holding on.</i>

19:41.548 --> 19:44.115
<i> ¶ and all that</i>
<i> I wanted was you ¶</i>

19:44.117 --> 19:46.317
<i> Turns out,</i>
<i> being called</i>
<i> "babby"</i>

19:46.319 --> 19:47.185
<i> Did make him</i>
<i> feel something.</i>

19:47.187 --> 19:50.688
<i> And as we danced</i>
<i> in a sea of</i>
<i> 12-year-old girls,</i>

19:50.690 --> 19:53.858
<i> We realized that</i>
<i> some things</i>
<i> from your past</i>

19:53.860 --> 19:55.459
<i> Are worth hanging on to.</i>

19:55.461 --> 19:56.961
Donnie!

19:56.963 --> 19:58.896
You're the best!

19:58.898 --> 20:01.332
Yeah! He pointed at me!

20:01.334 --> 20:03.301
<i> Sure, you might think</i>
<i> you've outgrown them,</i>

20:03.303 --> 20:06.070
<i> But deep down,</i>
<i> they always stay</i>
<i> in your heart.</i>

20:06.072 --> 20:08.472
<i> That's why it's nice</i>
<i> to hold on to</i>
<i> your memories,</i>

20:08.474 --> 20:11.509
<i> Even if they're tucked</i>
<i> in the back of your closet,</i>

20:11.511 --> 20:13.511
<i> To remind you</i>
<i> of where you came from</i>

20:13.513 --> 20:15.746
<i> And the people</i>
<i> who knew you when.</i>

20:15.748 --> 20:17.648

20:51.683 --> 20:52.617
All right,

World's most badass
