WEBVTT

00:09.133 --> 00:10.033
Right now, we're failing.

00:12.467 --> 00:13.933
We won't be able
to come back next year

00:13.967 --> 00:15.767
if we don't find enough gold
to continue this.

00:18.667 --> 00:22.167
I'll have to take out loans
and I don't wanna
have to do that.

00:22.200 --> 00:26.167
We survive off the gold
we make and right now
we have not made enough gold.

00:28.033 --> 00:30.867
We've been working
so, so hard

00:31.767 --> 00:32.833
and right now,

00:35.600 --> 00:37.967
as far as I'm concerned,
we haven't even paid
for the gasoline yet.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.267
[Carlos exclaims]
Brain freeze.

00:45.300 --> 00:47.700
[man] No hot water,
diver's got no hot water.

00:47.733 --> 00:50.133
-[man] Get back!
-He is going straight down.

00:50.167 --> 00:53.800
Leaving that wall
that could collapse
and just bury you.

00:53.833 --> 00:54.767
He's building a death trap.

00:57.367 --> 00:59.667
Three, two, one.

01:01.067 --> 01:02.533
Oh!

01:02.567 --> 01:03.400
[man over radio]
Lots of rocks.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.700
I need to find out
what's in the bottom
of this damn chute.

01:11.267 --> 01:13.967
That just excites
the heck out of me
right there.

01:14.067 --> 01:16.833
[Stamper] There's more!
[exclaims]

01:16.867 --> 01:19.133
-Sexy gold.
-Oh, my [bleep].

01:19.167 --> 01:20.400
Look at that!

01:20.433 --> 01:22.267
[all shouting]

01:22.300 --> 01:23.667
We're back on the gold!

01:37.800 --> 01:39.500
[Carlos] This is [bleep].

01:39.533 --> 01:40.633
We're doing worse.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.633
Way worse
than the first season.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.633
We have nothing, zero.

01:44.667 --> 01:45.733
I mean... [sighs]

01:45.767 --> 01:47.767
-[Carlos] We need gold, man.
-Yeah.

01:47.800 --> 01:51.500
We gotta do this quick, man.
We gotta do this really,
really quick.

01:51.533 --> 01:53.400
All right, you ready?

01:53.433 --> 01:56.933
[narrator] Two-thirds
of the way through
their season,

01:56.967 --> 02:01.567
Dustin and his crew
don't have an ounce of gold
to their name.

02:02.367 --> 02:03.367
[James Hamm] Ooh.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.933
I'm [bleep] tired, man.

02:05.967 --> 02:07.700
Right now, we have no gold.

02:07.733 --> 02:11.133
I've been working hard,
my leg's sore,
my shoulder's sore.

02:11.167 --> 02:13.100
My muscles are twitching
and [bleep].

02:20.600 --> 02:21.533
[Dustin] Keeping
me up at night.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.800
Losing sleep over
not getting gold.

02:24.833 --> 02:26.100
It's plagued my mind.

02:26.833 --> 02:28.067
I need to get to the bottom.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.067
[narrator] Two weeks ago...

02:33.100 --> 02:36.933
[Dustin] We gotta figure
something else out,
because this is not working.

02:36.967 --> 02:38.933
[narrator] ...Dustin
abandoned House Rock

02:38.967 --> 02:42.067
after finding no gold
on his side of the creek.

02:45.067 --> 02:45.867
Wow.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.067
That water is outrageous.

02:50.167 --> 02:52.467
[narrator] To change
his fortunes, he returned

02:52.500 --> 02:55.133
to proven ground
at the Chute.

02:55.167 --> 02:58.200
[Carlos] We're back
at it again,
back to the Chute.

03:00.467 --> 03:02.167
[Kayla Johanson] If we have
two dredges going,

03:02.200 --> 03:05.200
two people diving,
then we can move
way more material.

03:05.233 --> 03:07.133
[narrator] Leaving Kayla
running the show

03:07.167 --> 03:11.200
and seizing the chance
to double down
with two dredges...

03:11.233 --> 03:14.133
I may be able
to put together
a junkyard dredge.

03:14.367 --> 03:15.200
Hmm.

03:18.667 --> 03:19.900
-There it goes.
-[man] There it goes.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.133
[narrator] Now,
Dustin must run a dredge

03:23.167 --> 03:25.667
he built out of scraps
from their junkyard.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.133
[over radio] I sure hope
this junkyard dredge
holds up.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.967
I sure hope it still lives.

03:36.533 --> 03:39.367
Right now it feels
like it should be in an ICU,
you know what I mean?

03:41.200 --> 03:42.067
DNR.

03:43.967 --> 03:45.500
- All right?
-[Dustin] All right.

03:45.533 --> 03:46.433
[over radio] I'm still diving.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.633
[exclaims]

03:54.233 --> 03:56.367
Oh, yeah.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.167
[Dustin over radio] How's
your water temp?

03:58.200 --> 04:00.233
[Carlos over radio] Good.
No, everything is good.

04:00.267 --> 04:01.467
[Dustin over radio] Awesome.

04:01.500 --> 04:02.833
[Carlos over radio] Where's
my dredge hose?

04:04.967 --> 04:06.667
Oh, here we go.

04:06.700 --> 04:07.900
We're ready to rock and roll,
dude.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.367
There's a wall that drops
straight down right here.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.333
I'm hoping Carlos
can make that flat

04:13.367 --> 04:15.567
all the way across
the entire thing.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.800
I need to find out
what's at the bottom
of this damn Chute.

04:21.133 --> 04:23.800
[narrator] An ancient
waterfall of the Chute,

04:23.833 --> 04:27.067
cut a plunge pool in bedrock,

04:27.067 --> 04:30.633
creating a perfect catch
for nuggets washing
down the creek.

04:32.800 --> 04:37.667
Carlos's mission,
clear the rocks and gravel
in the narrow ravine,

04:37.700 --> 04:40.233
exposing all four
bedrock walls

04:40.267 --> 04:42.500
that form the top
of the plunge pool

04:42.533 --> 04:46.900
and lead down
to what could be
life-changing gold.

04:51.433 --> 04:53.133
[Carlos over radio]
This dredge don't got
no power, man.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.733
[Dustin over radio] Let me
find out if they're maxed out,
bro.

04:57.233 --> 04:58.700
[Carlos over radio] That's
all of it, man.

04:58.733 --> 05:01.233
Oh, man, if we had
our big dredge,

05:01.267 --> 05:05.100
we would be eating
this thing up, eating good.

05:05.133 --> 05:07.233
Carlos, right now,
is getting into a good spot.

05:07.267 --> 05:10.467
He's trying to open up a hole,
but the material
that we're going through

05:10.500 --> 05:13.867
is a lot of rounded rock,
a lot of, uh, irons

05:13.900 --> 05:17.067
and, uh, a lot of heavy,
uh, granite rock.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.067
I don't like that hose at all.

05:19.100 --> 05:22.733
We gotta kill this Chute
and get down to the bottom.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.567
We're digging a hole.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.967
Not fast, but we're
digging a hole.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.467
Do what we can.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.333
[Carlos over radio] Hey,
James, can you, uh,

05:33.367 --> 05:35.267
give me some more slack
for my nozzle?

05:37.633 --> 05:38.667
Oh, [bleep].

05:41.200 --> 05:42.967
Uh-oh.

05:43.067 --> 05:44.967
See, that's the problem
there's no suction.

05:48.333 --> 05:49.767
[Dustin over radio] Let me see
what the problem is.

05:51.533 --> 05:52.500
[Carlos over radio]
Oh, [bleep].

05:53.700 --> 05:54.667
It sucks it up.

05:55.867 --> 05:56.833
That's bad.

05:57.767 --> 05:59.600
This clog's really bad.

05:59.633 --> 06:01.767
I don't know what...
I mean, look at the flow.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.433
It's gotta be solid
with something.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.833
We have a hose
that is so flimsy...

06:07.867 --> 06:09.400
This is, like, the very first
hose we ever used.

06:09.433 --> 06:11.333
It's all we could get
ahold of right now.

06:11.367 --> 06:13.733
And, uh, it just wants
to keep like this.

06:13.767 --> 06:16.933
We keep going like this
all day long, this is not
gonna get any yardage moved.

06:16.967 --> 06:20.800
We really need the dredge
to work along with all
of the other systems as well.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.600
[narrator] The worn out
dredge hose can't keep up

06:24.633 --> 06:27.967
with the amount of material
Carlos is trying to move,

06:29.133 --> 06:31.933
causing a clog in its pipe.

06:31.967 --> 06:34.167
[Dustin over radio] Hey,
Carlos, coming back down
with the hose.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.200
[Carlos over radio] Yup,
yup, yup.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.600
[Dustin] We're gonna
throttle back up
and see if that clears it.

06:38.633 --> 06:39.967
[Carlos over radio] Okay,
go ahead.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.167
[Dustin over radio] Do we
have suction now?

06:46.200 --> 06:49.433
[Carlos over radio] Uh...
Oh, I got no suction.

06:50.300 --> 06:51.633
It's a [bleep] show.

06:52.733 --> 06:54.833
[narrator] The blockage
has been cleared,

06:54.867 --> 06:57.267
but Carlos still
has no suction.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.067
[James] It's gotta be
the [bleep] hose.

07:00.067 --> 07:02.400
It's got a flapper
or something in it.

07:02.433 --> 07:05.733
[Carlos over radio] Wow,
that rip...

07:05.767 --> 07:07.333
[Dustin over radio] What are
you saying?

07:07.367 --> 07:09.067
[Carlos over radio] A rip
by the collar.

07:10.533 --> 07:12.600
It's got an opening
right there,
when he lifts it up,

07:12.633 --> 07:15.700
it just pulls air, like,
through that crack,
hard, hard, hard.

07:17.067 --> 07:18.900
Just wrap the hell out of it
until it stops.

07:20.067 --> 07:22.067
[narrator] A tear
in the top of the hose

07:22.067 --> 07:24.333
means Carlos is getting
zero suction.

07:25.900 --> 07:28.100
We thought our hose
was stopped up,
but this is a rotten hose,

07:28.133 --> 07:30.333
so we're just gonna try
to duct tape if for today,

07:30.367 --> 07:31.933
see if we can get
a suction on it.

07:44.833 --> 07:46.100
[Carlos over radio] All right,
got suction now.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.867
Let's give it another start.

07:54.900 --> 07:58.633
This reminds me
of our first days of dredging,
when we had pieces of junk.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.967
Nothing would work,
we forgot how to fix

08:01.067 --> 08:04.400
all the crappy stuff
that we've already eliminated.

08:07.133 --> 08:08.167
We'll make it work.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.767
[narrator] A thousand feet
up creek...

08:15.800 --> 08:17.500
[man] [bleep] look
at that water.

08:17.533 --> 08:19.933
Oh, my [bleep],
clearer than yesterday.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.400
You're gonna have
great vis today.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.300
[man] Holy [bleep].

08:24.333 --> 08:27.433
-[Kayla] Look how far down
you can see rocks now.
-[man] Yeah.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.067
Let's get in the water
while it's clear.

08:29.067 --> 08:29.867
Yeah.

08:31.133 --> 08:33.767
[narrator] For the last month,
Kayla's crew have had

08:33.800 --> 08:36.267
a steady stream
of gold in the box,

08:37.300 --> 08:40.167
but are yet to hit
a big deposit.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.067
We need to start
finding more gold.

08:42.067 --> 08:45.367
This late in the season,
you know, we don't have
that much gold yet.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.133
So, we're gonna get
two divers in the water,

08:47.167 --> 08:48.633
it's gonna be
Stamper and Paul.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.667
They should be able
to work all new materials

08:50.700 --> 08:52.433
and hopefully get
more gold in the box.

08:52.467 --> 08:55.233
So you just have to look
at the main goal,

08:55.267 --> 08:57.067
which is getting to bedrock
and getting more gold.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.700
[narrator] Running two
dredges and two divers,

09:02.733 --> 09:07.667
is the only way the crew
will hit bedrock
before season's end.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.767
[Stamper] I'm not happy
with what we've got so far.

09:09.800 --> 09:14.100
I'm done with these
itty bitty cleanups.
I'm done with that.

09:14.133 --> 09:16.633
Today is gonna be
nothing but ounces.

09:17.433 --> 09:18.267
All right.

09:22.067 --> 09:23.900
[Paul] He's got a pretty good
hole opened up down there.

09:23.933 --> 09:26.167
Open the top up
as much as you can

09:26.200 --> 09:29.833
and then work down,
that way you can expose
as much bedrock as possible.

09:29.867 --> 09:32.067
I definitely like having
two divers in the water.

09:32.100 --> 09:35.067
It's perfect.
I can't wait to see
what the bedrock looks like.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.933
There's amazing gold
right here.

09:39.133 --> 09:40.233
[Stamper over radio]
All right, Kayla,

09:40.267 --> 09:42.067
how about we go get
some ounces of gold?

09:42.100 --> 09:43.100
[Kayla over radio] Do it.

09:47.367 --> 09:48.900
Yeah, let me know
what it looks like.

09:48.933 --> 09:51.500
[Stamper over radio] Oh,
my [bleeping] , it's beautiful.

09:51.533 --> 09:53.233
[Kayla] How deep
do you think you are
down there?

09:54.333 --> 09:56.600
[Stamper over radio]
Only got about 14 feet.

09:58.267 --> 10:01.300
If I know what's good,
I'll just keep dredging
over here along this wall.

10:02.067 --> 10:03.033
[Scott] How's that?

10:03.067 --> 10:04.300
[Paul over radio] Feels
good to me.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.200
Good to go.

10:06.067 --> 10:06.867
[Scott] All right.

10:08.867 --> 10:10.500
[Paul over radio] Whoo-hoo!

10:10.533 --> 10:12.533
[Scott] Stamper, Paul is
in the water.

10:12.567 --> 10:13.700
[Stamper over radio]
Hey, Paul.

10:13.733 --> 10:15.833
[Paul over radio]
How's it going?

10:15.867 --> 10:17.567
[Stamper over radio] Going
for the nozzle right now.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.700
[Paul over radio]
Let's get it.

10:18.733 --> 10:20.067
[Stamper over radio] Get it,
brother, let's get it.

10:23.767 --> 10:26.900
[narrator] To get to bedrock
before winter hits,

10:26.933 --> 10:32.033
will require them digging down
to the depth
of a two-story house.

10:32.067 --> 10:35.567
At 13 feet,
they're around halfway.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.267
But with less
than two months
left in the season,

10:38.300 --> 10:41.067
they need to be
running two dredges daily,

10:41.100 --> 10:44.833
if they're going to hit
what could be
a life-changing payday.

10:52.267 --> 10:54.833
[Stamper over radio]
I love this kind of dredging.
I don't have to move anywhere.

10:56.367 --> 10:58.167
[Paul over radio] Ah,
I'm ready for the basket.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.500
[Scott] Yup, we're bringing
the basket.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.067
[Stamper over radio]
All right. [grunts]

11:11.667 --> 11:13.100
Right now, what I'm
looking at

11:14.700 --> 11:16.667
is a massive boulder.

11:20.633 --> 11:21.667
What the [bleep]?

11:22.500 --> 11:24.067
How big is that rock?

11:24.100 --> 11:27.400
[Stamper over radio] It's
over 6 feet long
and about 4.5 feet tall.

11:28.167 --> 11:29.067
[Kayla] [bleep]

11:30.100 --> 11:32.700
[narrator] Weighing
over 7 tons,

11:32.733 --> 11:35.967
this is one
of the largest boulders
the crew have encountered.

11:37.367 --> 11:41.400
And it lies directly
between them
and bedrock gold.

11:43.467 --> 11:45.833
I'd just love
to get that big [bleep]
out of there.

11:49.167 --> 11:53.600
Right now, I'm prepping
these power heads,
so that we can drill rock

11:53.633 --> 11:55.100
and expand them.

11:55.133 --> 11:58.500
We're encountering rocks
that are too big
for our winches to haul off.

11:58.533 --> 12:02.367
So, in order to move them,
we have to make them smaller,

12:02.400 --> 12:04.067
so that our winches
can handle them.

12:08.233 --> 12:10.333
[Stamper over radio]
We gonna go, "Kapow,"

12:10.367 --> 12:12.367
and a big old piece
will fall of then.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.167
That would be nice.

12:22.133 --> 12:23.067
[Stamper over radio] Okay.

12:28.567 --> 12:29.767
All right, fire in the hole!

12:33.867 --> 12:37.833
Three, two, one.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.300
-[Stamper and Paul exclaim]
-[bleeping]

12:44.333 --> 12:45.800
-[Scott] I felt that.
-[Kayla] I felt that
up here.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.767
[all exclaiming]

12:46.800 --> 12:47.633
[man] Hell, yeah.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.433
[bleep], yeah.

12:49.767 --> 12:50.833
Nice.

12:53.067 --> 12:56.600
So, are the pieces
small enough that we can
pull it out with the winch?

12:56.633 --> 12:58.167
-[Stamper over radio] Yup.
-Awesome.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.767
[Kayla over radio]
Good job, whoo!

12:59.800 --> 13:00.867
[Stamper over radio]
Busting rocks.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.333
[narrator] The blasted
boulder cleared,

13:10.600 --> 13:13.167
the divers can get
back to their mission

13:13.200 --> 13:16.533
to reach bedrock gold
before winter hits.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.500
[Scott] Get back to work,
you scurvy dogs.

13:31.433 --> 13:34.067
[Paul over radio] You're
not gonna [bleep]
believe this.

13:34.067 --> 13:35.700
[Kayla] You found gold
already?

13:35.733 --> 13:37.467
[Kayla over radio]
Holy [bleep].

13:37.500 --> 13:38.833
[Paul over radio] I'm
not even looking for it

13:38.867 --> 13:41.067
and it's just laying
right here in front of me.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.100
[grunts]

13:48.167 --> 13:49.367
[Stamper over radio]
There's more!

13:49.400 --> 13:50.500
Suck it up that [bleep] up.

13:50.533 --> 13:52.133
[Kayla over radio] You're
gonna have to suck it up.

13:52.167 --> 13:55.100
I'm really excited to see
what we get
when we hit bedrock,

13:55.133 --> 13:56.833
'cause we don't know
how deep bedrock
is yet.

13:56.867 --> 13:58.267
We haven't hit
bedrock at all,

13:58.300 --> 14:01.467
so to be finding
gold like this,
that's a good sign.

14:06.533 --> 14:08.700
[narrator] Down the creek,
at the Chute...

14:09.367 --> 14:11.267
How's progress down there?

14:11.300 --> 14:14.433
[Carlos over radio] This
dredge is not letting me get
where I wanna get today.

14:15.067 --> 14:16.067
I hear you, man.

14:16.967 --> 14:19.100
[narrator] After losing
half their day

14:19.133 --> 14:22.433
battling with a hose
on their junkyard dredge...

14:22.467 --> 14:24.067
[Carlos over radio] Aw, man.

14:24.067 --> 14:27.600
[narrator] ...Carlos
is back on the search
for the bedrock walls

14:27.633 --> 14:29.567
that form the top
of the plunge pool

14:29.600 --> 14:32.667
that could change
their fortunes.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.467
[Carlos over radio] I got
bedrock on my left-hand side.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.533
[Dustin] I like that.
Like it.

14:39.567 --> 14:41.233
[Carlos over radio] I'm
just working on the left.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.700
I've got bedrock on my left,
man, yeah.

14:50.733 --> 14:52.533
-[James] That's good news,
man.
-[Dustin] That is good news.

14:54.067 --> 14:56.667
[Dustin over radio] We're
not there yet,
but real close.

14:58.733 --> 15:00.633
Hey, man,
how do you feel
about coming up?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.600
[Carlos over radio] Yeah, man.
I'm coming up.

15:03.967 --> 15:06.300
[narrator] Carlos has
succeeded in uncovering

15:06.333 --> 15:10.200
two of the four bedrock walls
at the top of the plunge pool.

15:11.967 --> 15:13.567
[Carlos] What a very...

15:13.600 --> 15:16.100
-Hard dive, right?
-Ugh, gosh.

15:16.133 --> 15:18.700
-Frustrating dive.
-[Dustin] Frustrating.

15:18.733 --> 15:22.100
[narrator]
But the worn-out hose
cost them valuable time.

15:23.933 --> 15:25.133
[Carlos] We got progress.

15:25.167 --> 15:28.167
I did what I wanted to do,
uh, it was very frustrating.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.733
Very frustrating,
but the job got done.

15:30.767 --> 15:32.800
I'm telling you, man,
if I had that big dredge
right now, man,

15:32.833 --> 15:34.433
I would have frickin' went
down to 10 feet.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.667
It'd be great, man,
if we had some gold.

15:39.067 --> 15:41.067
Nothing in there
but false hopes.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.433
[man] This hose
is so [bleep].

15:43.900 --> 15:47.600
Yeah, man, new hose
or new dredge, man,
we need one or the other, man.

15:47.633 --> 15:49.300
We'll be here forever, dude.

15:49.333 --> 15:52.967
[James] Right now,
we're at zero, we need
to see some gold.

15:53.067 --> 15:56.267
[Dustin] This turned into
a bit of a nightmare.

15:56.300 --> 15:59.367
I don't see any other way.
We're gonna have
to take that hose.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.300
That's it.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.667
I got no two ways
about it.

16:15.067 --> 16:18.667
[Kayla] Hey, guys,
I think we're done here,
so let's see how we did.

16:18.700 --> 16:19.767
[Paul over radio]
All right, Kayla.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.133
[Stamper over radio]
All right, coming up.

16:22.167 --> 16:26.667
[narrator] At House Rock,
Stamper and Paul
have finished four hours

16:26.700 --> 16:27.533
of double dredging.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.133
[Paul grunts]

16:31.533 --> 16:32.533
[Kayla] Good dive.

16:32.567 --> 16:33.833
[Stamper groans]

16:36.367 --> 16:37.400
You wanna check the box?

16:46.367 --> 16:48.633
Holy [bleep]! [laughs]

16:50.367 --> 16:51.967
Oh, [bleep]!
Look at that.

16:53.100 --> 16:56.067
[Stamper] G-O-L-D.
[exclaims]

16:56.833 --> 16:58.100
Sexy gold. [laughs]

16:58.600 --> 16:59.700
Oh, my [bleep].

17:01.100 --> 17:03.300
I love seeing gold.

17:03.967 --> 17:06.400
It puts a smile on my face.

17:06.433 --> 17:07.800
[Paul] Oh, damn,
look at that piece.

17:09.167 --> 17:11.933
[narrator] Running two
dredges is paying off
for Kayla,

17:11.967 --> 17:14.267
with gold in both
sluice boxes.

17:15.633 --> 17:16.467
[Stamper] It's awesome.

17:17.633 --> 17:19.800
[narrator] And if they
continue at this pace,

17:21.067 --> 17:24.367
they will hit bedrock
before the season ends.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.967
[Scott] Well,
there's another piece.

17:26.067 --> 17:27.233
-[Stamper] Hell, yeah.
-[Dustin] Hey, Paul.

17:29.233 --> 17:30.067
[Paul] Uh-oh.

17:31.067 --> 17:32.233
[Stamper] Hey, y'all.

17:33.867 --> 17:34.867
[Scott] We're in trouble.

17:37.067 --> 17:38.500
[Kayla] What are you
doing here?

17:38.533 --> 17:40.867
[Dustin] Came down
here today 'cause
we've been trying

17:40.900 --> 17:43.967
to dredge over
there in the Chute,
and the hose that we got...

17:44.067 --> 17:45.800
As far as I'm concerned,
it's unusable,

17:45.833 --> 17:48.767
and it's costing me
a lot of time and effort.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.833
So I'm going to have to take
one of these 35-foot hoses.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.800
Okay.

17:54.833 --> 17:57.433
-Uh--
-[Dustin] I was trying to give
you guys everything I could,

17:57.467 --> 18:01.333
but at some point, if it stops
my work over there,

18:01.367 --> 18:02.900
I got to do
something about it.

18:02.933 --> 18:07.467
Basically, I will not
finish this if I keep
going like this.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.933
That's gonna slow
us down a little bit,
getting to bedrock.

18:09.967 --> 18:12.100
[Dustin] I wouldn't
do it if I didn't have to.

18:12.133 --> 18:15.333
It's got our progress
down to... Just a crawl.

18:15.367 --> 18:17.233
Okay. Um--

18:17.267 --> 18:20.633
Sorry about that,
but I have to take
one of these hoses.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.367
[Scott] This is bull-[bleep].

18:24.233 --> 18:25.233
[Dustin] You guys ready?

18:26.067 --> 18:27.200
Let's grab a hose.

18:28.533 --> 18:29.667
[Carlos] Holy [bleep].

18:30.500 --> 18:31.867
Don't drop it,
whatever you do.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.333
I feel bad
for taking it, but--

18:34.367 --> 18:37.067
[Carlos chuckles] Oh,
we have to, man. There's
no doubt about it, man.

18:37.067 --> 18:39.767
[Kayla] Jeez Louise.
[bleep]-show.

18:41.067 --> 18:44.500
[narrator] Without the hose,
Kayla can only run one dredge,

18:45.533 --> 18:48.833
a major setback
in her march to bedrock gold.

18:51.133 --> 18:54.067
[Kayla] So them taking
that hose, it definitely puts
a roadblock on things,

18:54.067 --> 18:56.767
so we need to figure out
what we're gonna
do about that.

18:56.800 --> 19:00.933
So we just have to make
the best of what we have,
which is only one dredge.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.533
We need every advantage
we can take right now

19:04.567 --> 19:06.433
to speed up the process
of getting the bedrock.

19:06.467 --> 19:08.067
'Cause it's getting late
in the season.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.700
It's a pain in the ass,
but we gotta do
what we gotta do.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.067
[Dustin] What do you think?

19:13.067 --> 19:15.567
What's the chances of me
falling and really hurting
myself, man?

19:16.900 --> 19:18.067
[James] 85% to 90%.

19:19.600 --> 19:20.900
I'll take that.

19:20.933 --> 19:21.933
[Dustin grunts]

19:23.200 --> 19:26.167
-I got a backpack.
-[Carlos] Holy [bleep], man.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.933
-[Dustin] Holy [bleep].
-[Carlos laughs] Yeah! Dustin.

19:28.967 --> 19:30.467
[Dustin] Let's dig
a hole, y'all.

19:34.933 --> 19:41.067
[narrator] As Dustin departs
with her precious hose,
all Kayla can do is push on.

19:41.067 --> 19:42.733
[Kayla] I mean, look at that.
There's gold on that.

19:44.167 --> 19:45.167
[Stamper] There you go.

19:47.133 --> 19:48.667
It's pretty.

19:48.700 --> 19:50.367
We're seeing
some gold in the box,

19:50.400 --> 19:55.700
The top net had more
gold than we've seen
in the last clean-up, So...

19:55.733 --> 19:57.333
...at least we know
it's getting better.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.800
That's not good.

20:03.367 --> 20:05.733
There's gold on the carpet
this far back.

20:08.100 --> 20:11.067
There were actually
several flakes
on the carpet,

20:11.100 --> 20:13.833
which was under the moss,
in this back section.

20:13.867 --> 20:16.900
And that's really concerning.

20:16.933 --> 20:19.867
[narrator] A sluice box
should catch all the gold

20:19.900 --> 20:21.700
in the first two-thirds
of the mats.

20:23.267 --> 20:24.767
[Kayla] Well, this is just
the last two.

20:26.533 --> 20:29.333
[narrator] Finding any gold
at the bottom of the sluice

20:29.367 --> 20:33.000
is a sure sign you're sending
gold back into the creek.

20:35.633 --> 20:38.033
[Kayla] I mean, there's
three good-sized
flakes right there.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.567
That means we've blown
a lot of gold out.

20:42.767 --> 20:45.200
So we definitely need
an extension on our box.

20:45.233 --> 20:47.133
It's a good thing
we caught it when we did.

20:47.167 --> 20:49.467
So that's our next step.
That's what we'll be
working on tonight.

20:49.500 --> 20:52.567
It's making an extension
for the box, and we'll be
putting it on tomorrow.

20:53.933 --> 20:54.933
Roger!

20:56.667 --> 20:57.667
[dramatic music playing]

21:00.200 --> 21:02.467
-[James] Damn, dude.
-[Carlos laughing]

21:02.500 --> 21:04.800
-[James] I can't believe
you're doing this.
-[Dustin groans]

21:04.833 --> 21:06.933
-[James] You're crazy.
-[Dustin groans] Yeah, I know.

21:08.667 --> 21:13.200
[narrator] To get the vital
hose to their dive site
just a 1,000 feet down creek--

21:14.833 --> 21:18.867
[Carlos] Whoo! Holy moly.
I can't believe he's doing it.

21:18.900 --> 21:23.300
[narrator] ...Dustin, first,
has to haul it a quarter mile
up the side of the ravine.

21:25.133 --> 21:27.100
[James] Sucking all
the energy out of me
just looking.

21:27.133 --> 21:28.733
[Carlos laughing] Holy
[bleep], man.

21:29.667 --> 21:32.133
[Dustin breathing heavily]

21:34.567 --> 21:36.467
[bleep]. Whew.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.800
Having trouble getting air.
I need help.

21:40.967 --> 21:41.967
Back there, back there.

21:42.900 --> 21:45.200
[breathing heavily] [bleep].

21:46.800 --> 21:48.133
[bleep]

21:48.167 --> 21:49.867
[sighs and exhales]

21:51.367 --> 21:53.400
[James] We never
should have brought
that [bleep] down here.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.533
-[Dustin exhaling]
-[Wes] Come on.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.667
-[bleep].
-[James] This has turned
into a pain in the ass.

21:59.767 --> 22:01.567
[Dustin breathing heavily]

22:03.167 --> 22:04.933
[Carlos] Holy [bleep], dude.

22:04.967 --> 22:06.567
-[James] Sit
down somewhere.
-[Wes] Sit down on this rock.

22:06.600 --> 22:07.667
[James exclaims]

22:07.700 --> 22:09.300
-[Dustin groans]
-[Wes] You can sit
on this rock.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.333
[Dustin groans]

22:12.367 --> 22:14.433
[sighing] All right,
I'm gonna take
this [bleep] off for a sec.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.733
[breathing heavily]

22:16.767 --> 22:17.767
[Carlos] Dude.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.200
[Dustin] You're worried
about me, aren't you?

22:22.233 --> 22:25.067
-[James] Yes.
-[Dustin laughing] Me too.

22:25.067 --> 22:28.367
[exclaims] Let's see
if I can get this to the rest
of the way without dying, huh?

22:28.400 --> 22:29.800
[all laughing]

22:32.067 --> 22:33.800
[Carlos] I think
that's too much, man.

22:33.833 --> 22:35.400
[Dustin] You just
gotta believe, Carlos.

22:35.433 --> 22:38.200
-You just gotta believe, man.
-[Carlos] Yeah. Yeah,
I hear you, man.

22:38.233 --> 22:40.267
-[Dustin grunts] Yeah.
-[James] There you go.

22:40.300 --> 22:41.400
[bleep], buddy. [bleep].

22:43.700 --> 22:45.367
-Dude.
-[Carlos] Yo, let's stop.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.500
-[James] [bleep] beast, man.
-[Carlos] Holy [bleep], man.

22:47.533 --> 22:51.167
-[James] [bleep] beast.
-[Carlos] Holy [bleep],
man. Ha!

22:51.200 --> 22:54.867
[narrator] Next, they
have to get it across
the zip line to camp.

22:56.667 --> 22:57.667
[Dustin] That was easy.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.667
Five years, Carlos.

23:00.700 --> 23:03.200
-[Carlos] Holy [bleep], dude.
-[Dustin] How the [bleep]
you still doubting me?

23:03.233 --> 23:04.233
[Carlos] I never
doubted you, man.

23:04.267 --> 23:05.833
I just can't see how it works!

23:05.867 --> 23:08.267
-It's like watching
a bumblebee fly.
-[Dustin laughing]

23:16.367 --> 23:17.967
[narrator] Next day, at camp.

23:19.233 --> 23:22.433
With Kayla now down
to just one dredge--

23:22.467 --> 23:24.133
[Kayla] Hey, Wes.

23:24.167 --> 23:28.200
[narrator] ...she needs
to ensure they're capturing
every single flake of gold

23:28.233 --> 23:30.167
that goes through
their sluice box.

23:31.700 --> 23:34.067
-What's going on?
-I got a question for you.

23:34.067 --> 23:37.100
-Um, I think we're losing
gold out the end of our box.
-Mmm-hmm.

23:37.133 --> 23:40.167
So I'd like to make
an extension to go on it
to catch more of that gold,

23:40.200 --> 23:41.733
and I was wondering
if you had anything
laying around

23:41.767 --> 23:43.400
that we could use to do that?

23:43.433 --> 23:46.300
You know, there are a couple
of old sluice boxes we found
in the tunnel over there,

23:46.333 --> 23:47.800
a bunch of years back.

23:47.833 --> 23:50.633
-You never wanna lose
any gold at all anyway, so--
-No, it all adds up.

23:50.667 --> 23:53.867
Um, yeah. I mean,
we can't cut up any
of our good sluice boxes.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.967
But those old ones,
they should be fair game.

23:56.067 --> 23:58.100
Yeah, I just think
it would catch the gold
a little bit better.

23:58.133 --> 24:00.700
-You're gonna have to give
me a share of that though.
-[Kayla chuckles]

24:04.300 --> 24:06.967
[Wes] Here, see if that'll
go. [moves riffle] What now?

24:07.067 --> 24:07.967
[Kayla] There it is.

24:09.767 --> 24:12.333
-What about this piece?
-Where did you
get that piece from?

24:12.367 --> 24:15.067
I found it laying
in the woods
over by our outhouse.

24:15.100 --> 24:16.700
[Wes] It's been around here
for probably 40 years.

24:16.733 --> 24:18.167
Yeah, you're welcome
to that, for sure.

24:20.100 --> 24:24.167
[Kayla] For now, we're working
on coming up with an idea
for an extension for the box.

24:24.200 --> 24:28.333
Um, 'cause we're blowing
gold out the back
of the box right now.

24:28.367 --> 24:31.200
The goal is to catch
the gold, not blow it out
the end of the box,

24:31.233 --> 24:33.833
so we're gonna make
a longer sluice.

24:33.867 --> 24:38.067
So that we can catch
more of the gold
and not lose as much.

24:38.067 --> 24:41.767
Should work. Hopefully,
uh, it solves our problem
with losing gold.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.500
Um, 'cause that's a problem
that we can't afford
to have right now.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.167
[dramatic music playing]

24:49.267 --> 24:50.400
[narrator] Up ahead...

24:50.433 --> 24:51.967
-[Kayla over radio]
Holy [bleep].
-[Scott] What?

24:53.333 --> 24:55.467
[Kayla] I just got
the biggest piece
we have so far.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.967
[Scott] You're [bleep]
kidding me.

24:57.067 --> 24:59.233
-[Stamper] Damn!
-[Scott] Oh,
my good [bleep].

24:59.267 --> 25:01.400
-[Kayla chuckles]
-[Scott] Those are
[bleep] nuggets, dude.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.933
[Dustin] James? Hey, James?

25:04.967 --> 25:06.533
Can you hear me, James?

25:06.567 --> 25:07.867
He's building a death trap.

25:14.967 --> 25:15.967
[dynamic music playing]

25:19.933 --> 25:20.933
[Stamper] Whoo!

25:24.100 --> 25:26.667
That looks pretty damn good!

25:26.700 --> 25:31.900
[narrator] At House Rock,
the crew's double-dredging
days are over.

25:31.933 --> 25:36.667
But Kayla is determined
to not lose any gold
from the remaining dredge.

25:37.967 --> 25:39.867
I mean, it fits pretty snug.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.800
[Kayla] I don't think
it's gonna go anywhere.

25:41.833 --> 25:43.933
Now, the dredge
is very back-heavy.

25:43.967 --> 25:45.933
so it steepens
the angle on the box.

25:45.967 --> 25:48.967
So when you steepen
the angle, the water
flows even faster.

25:49.067 --> 25:51.800
So what we need
to do is add pontoons
to the back,

25:51.833 --> 25:55.733
just to lift up the extension
a little bit more to flatten
out that angle a little bit.

25:55.767 --> 25:57.700
Here's your pontoons!

25:57.733 --> 26:00.067
It's the one time
I might actually clip in.

26:00.067 --> 26:02.100
-[Paul] Well, you have
your floatation built in.
-[Scott] Yeah!

26:03.867 --> 26:05.767
It's not like we can go
to the store and just
go buy them,

26:05.800 --> 26:07.600
we gotta make do
with what we got, so...

26:07.633 --> 26:10.367
This is what we got.
We'll make it work.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.500
[Stamper] Oh, there we go.

26:11.533 --> 26:12.533
[instrumental music playing]

26:15.067 --> 26:16.067
[narrator] Kayla's plan:

26:17.067 --> 26:19.800
add extra pontoons
to their dredge

26:19.833 --> 26:23.067
to float the back
of the sluice box
higher in the water...

26:25.900 --> 26:28.567
...slowing the flow
of material,

26:28.600 --> 26:32.067
and giving the gold
more time to settle
into the mats.

26:34.700 --> 26:37.633
-[Scott] There we go.
-[Paul] That's gonna
work really well.

26:37.667 --> 26:40.067
There shouldn't be any gold
going over the back
of this thing,

26:40.067 --> 26:41.833
Strap the [bleep] out of it.

26:41.867 --> 26:44.067
[Paul] I mean, it should catch
what we've been losing.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.700
I think that's good
right there.

26:47.733 --> 26:50.267
[narrator] Kayla may be
down to one dredge,

26:50.300 --> 26:53.200
but, at least, she won't
be losing gold anymore.

26:53.833 --> 26:55.133
[Scott] That'll work.

26:55.167 --> 26:57.667
I'm happy as hell
to see these on here.
It's like... [exclaims].

26:57.700 --> 26:59.600
Now we're gonna have
some little stuff, big stuff,

26:59.633 --> 27:01.900
and a whole
bunch of stuff in it.

27:01.933 --> 27:05.067
Whoo! I feel good. [chuckles]

27:06.133 --> 27:07.133
[dramatic music playing]

27:11.333 --> 27:14.133
Make sure it hooks,
because it bounces
a whole bunch.

27:14.167 --> 27:15.867
-[Carlos] It's hooked.
-[Dustin] Okay.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.333
If it falls, you gotta
go get it, man.

27:18.267 --> 27:19.633
Clear!

27:19.667 --> 27:22.833
[narrator] The last stage
of the hose's journey

27:22.867 --> 27:26.467
is to send it
down the haul line
from camp to the tunnel.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.367
[Dustin] All right.
Y'all know what to do.

27:38.533 --> 27:39.533
[dramatic music playing]

27:44.333 --> 27:45.867
Man, this hose is heavy.

27:45.900 --> 27:48.067
-[James]
That's what I figured.
-[laughs]

27:48.100 --> 27:50.700
All right. We got
a hose. Whoo!

27:53.333 --> 27:55.433
[Carlos] It looks like
it'll fit just right in, man.

27:59.433 --> 28:03.067
This thing will never
come out, dude.
Oh, my [bleep].

28:03.100 --> 28:04.933
[chuckling]Yeah, dude.

28:10.100 --> 28:11.667
-[James] What is that?
-[Wes] What?

28:13.800 --> 28:14.800
What you got there?

28:17.267 --> 28:19.133
[both guffawing]

28:20.067 --> 28:21.333
[James] [bleep], yeah!

28:21.367 --> 28:24.167
-How the [bleep]
did we miss that?
-[Wes chuckling] I don't know.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.667
[James] Holy [bleep].

28:25.700 --> 28:29.067
[Wes chuckles] I just
spotted it. I was like,
"That looks like gold."

28:29.067 --> 28:31.067
-[laughing]
-[James] Dude!
That's a nice one.

28:31.067 --> 28:33.400
[both laughing]

28:33.433 --> 28:35.667
[James] [bleep], yeah!
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo.

28:35.700 --> 28:37.567
[Wes] We found gold
in the sluice box.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.267
-[Carlos] What!
-[Wes] Yes!

28:39.300 --> 28:41.067
[Carlos] What the [bleep]?
You [bleep] with me?

28:41.067 --> 28:42.600
-[Dustin] Get the
[bleep] out of here.
-[Wes] Gold!

28:42.633 --> 28:44.133
[all laughing]

28:44.167 --> 28:48.800
[narrator] After three months
without seeing a single
speck of gold,

28:48.833 --> 28:53.500
Dustin and his crew finally
have their first nugget
of this season.

28:53.533 --> 28:56.267
We had so many problems
the other day. We really
didn't look for gold.

28:56.300 --> 28:59.367
We're not expecting
any gold till we get
down to some depth.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.767
And the next thing... Yeah!
There's this nugget
sitting in the box.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.933
Can you believe it?
That just excites the heck
out of me, right there.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.867
[James] That's a great sign.

29:08.900 --> 29:12.500
I want to get
to the bottom of the Chute,
see what's in the bottom.

29:12.533 --> 29:14.933
And it made my day.

29:14.967 --> 29:16.400
I'm tickled pink right now.

29:16.433 --> 29:19.367
And can't wait
to get dredging.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.367
-[Carlos] Yeah, dude!
-[Dustin] That's awesome, man.

29:21.400 --> 29:22.933
-[Carlos chuckling]
-We need to see some gold.

29:22.967 --> 29:24.533
-[Wes] Yes.
-No, no, no. Seriously.

29:24.567 --> 29:27.167
-[Wes] Yes.
-Need. I don't use the word,
"need," very often.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.933
-[Wes] I agree.
-We need to see some gold.

29:28.967 --> 29:30.767
Clear! Let's go
dig a hole, y'all.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.067
[Carlos] Let's dig
a hole, y'all.

29:32.067 --> 29:34.700
[both chuckling]

29:34.733 --> 29:35.733
[dramatic music playing]

29:37.233 --> 29:38.867
[narrator] At House Rock--

29:38.900 --> 29:40.067
[Kayla] Will you zip me up?

29:41.567 --> 29:43.400
[narrator] ...Kayla
is down to one dredge.

29:44.867 --> 29:47.433
[Kayla] Today,
I'm doing a solo dive.

29:47.467 --> 29:50.100
Ideally, we wanna be running
both dredges every day.

29:50.133 --> 29:51.667
But they took our hose.

29:51.700 --> 29:53.567
So I'm gonna dive by myself.

29:55.467 --> 29:58.633
[narrator] On the last dive,
the crew cleared
some boulders

29:58.667 --> 30:00.867
and found
a decent-sized picker.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.600
Hopefully, under those big
boulders will be big gold.

30:04.633 --> 30:07.967
So I'm looking forward
to seeing what's in the box
at the end of the day.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.400
[over radio] Okay,
I'm going in.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.233
-Yeah, this sucks.
-[Scott over radio] Your
visibility went from 6 feet

30:16.267 --> 30:18.467
to 6 inches
in a matter of seconds.

30:18.500 --> 30:21.367
[Kayla] Oh, well.
I'm gonna start dredging.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.667
-Please turn the motors up.
-[Scott over radio]
Motors up!

30:27.400 --> 30:28.400
[suction dredging]

30:32.100 --> 30:34.300
[Scott] That looks
so much better.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.733
[Stamper] That's what
it's supposed to look like.
A real dredge.

30:37.767 --> 30:39.567
So much better.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.133
[Stamper] That's gonna
catch everything.

30:43.967 --> 30:46.500
[Kayla] Well, we just need
to focus on what we're
doing today.

30:48.700 --> 30:51.233
We'll be able to move
more material and...

30:51.267 --> 30:53.633
we'll see some
shiny yellow in the box
at the end of the day.

30:53.667 --> 30:54.967
That's our hope.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
[suction dredging]

30:59.300 --> 31:01.667
-[Kayla] Hey, guess what?
- [Scott over radio] What?

31:01.700 --> 31:04.433
[Kayla chuckles] Get
the bottle.

31:04.467 --> 31:07.233
-[Scott] You're [bleep]
kidding me.
- [Kayla] I'm not kidding.

31:07.267 --> 31:10.100
-There's pickers down here.
- [Scott] I like hearing that.

31:10.800 --> 31:11.800
[Kayla] I'm coming up.

31:15.567 --> 31:17.700
[Stamper chuckles] Nice!

31:17.733 --> 31:20.400
-[Scott over radio] Get
back in there. Go get more.
-[Kayla chuckles]

31:20.433 --> 31:21.633
[Scott chuckling]

31:24.200 --> 31:25.200
[suction dredging]

31:31.333 --> 31:34.667
-[Kayla] Holy [bleep].
-[Scott] What?

31:34.700 --> 31:36.967
[Kayla] I just got
the biggest piece
we have so far.

31:37.067 --> 31:38.433
[Scott] You're
[bleep] kidding me.

31:38.467 --> 31:40.733
-[Stamper] Damn!
-[Scott] Oh, my good [bleep].

31:48.167 --> 31:49.167
[dramatic music playing]

31:51.967 --> 31:54.133
-[Kayla over radio]
Holy [bleep].
-[Scott over radio] What?

31:54.167 --> 31:56.300
[Kayla] I just got
the biggest piece
we have so far.

31:56.333 --> 31:58.333
[Scott] You're
[bleep] kidding me.

31:58.367 --> 32:01.500
[narrator] At House Rock,
despite being a dredge down...

32:03.433 --> 32:05.367
...Kayla is the on the gold.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.767
-[Stamper] Damn!
-[Scott] Oh, my good [bleep].

32:07.800 --> 32:11.067
-Don't tell my wife,
but I think I might love you.
-[Kayla chuckles]

32:11.067 --> 32:13.900
[Scott] [bleep].
Those are nuggets.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.867
Those are [bleep]
nuggets, dude.

32:15.900 --> 32:17.667
Holy [bleep].

32:17.700 --> 32:19.167
[Kayla] All right,
I'm going back in.

32:20.567 --> 32:23.467
[Scott] In the bottle.
Suck that [bleep] up!

32:23.500 --> 32:25.833
[Stamper] It's great that
we've been getting gold
all week long.

32:25.867 --> 32:27.433
[Kayla] It's nice,
pretty chunky gold.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.567
So I'm really happy.
We aren't even on bedrock yet.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.800
So the deeper we get,
the bigger it should get.

32:35.067 --> 32:38.733
[narrator] After
three hours, Kayla
has gained an extra foot.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.400
[Kayla] Hey, I'm coming up!

32:47.367 --> 32:48.833
[Kayla] Look at the front.

32:48.867 --> 32:51.167
-[Stamper] Oh, yeah.
-[Scott] There's a lot
of gold in there.

32:51.200 --> 32:54.267
[Stamper] But the good
thing is, we don't see
gold way down.

32:54.300 --> 32:55.933
It's catching it
right up front.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.067
[Kayla] Nice.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.867
Normally, you gotta work
for it a little bit.

32:59.900 --> 33:01.500
And today, it was just
easy picking.

33:01.533 --> 33:03.133
-Easy pickings!
-[Kayla] Easy picking.

33:03.167 --> 33:04.167
Yee-haw!

33:04.800 --> 33:07.067
[laughing]

33:07.067 --> 33:09.467
[Kayla] These were the first,
like, actual nuggets
that we found.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.200
That's really exciting.

33:11.233 --> 33:13.867
I think that's a really good
sign that there's gonna be
a lot more nuggets on bedrock.

33:18.067 --> 33:19.067
[dramatic music playing]

33:20.433 --> 33:23.933
[narrator] Down
the creek, at the Chute...

33:23.967 --> 33:26.367
[Carlos] We got a new hose
for the dredge, so we're
gonna get great suction.

33:27.333 --> 33:28.833
[narrator] ...the crew
are on a high

33:28.867 --> 33:31.200
after catching their
first nugget of the season.

33:32.867 --> 33:34.867
Looks like my ass
is in the water today.

33:34.900 --> 33:36.367
And hopefully,
I can find a nugget.

33:37.300 --> 33:38.600
I'm just dying
to get in there.

33:39.433 --> 33:40.767
I'm gonna tear it up today.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.067
See if I can get some gold.

33:45.600 --> 33:46.767
-[Dustin] Feeling good?
-Yep.

33:48.100 --> 33:50.767
Just take your time.
One rock at a time, man.

33:50.800 --> 33:52.433
[James] Yep.

33:52.467 --> 33:54.433
[Dustin] All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.433
It is time...

33:57.133 --> 33:58.700
...to get some [bleep] gold!

33:58.733 --> 34:00.667
-[James over radio] Ready?
-[Dustin] Yeah, go on.

34:00.700 --> 34:01.833
[James] Dive with the wind!

34:07.567 --> 34:09.533
I love my job.

34:09.567 --> 34:11.933
What's it looking like
down there right now, man?

34:13.133 --> 34:15.533
[James] I just, uh, I keep
doing parameter checks,

34:15.567 --> 34:17.433
and I see big rocks and stuff.

34:18.900 --> 34:20.400
Make sure
they don't hit me in the head.

34:21.067 --> 34:22.500
Copy that.

34:22.533 --> 34:24.900
-[over radio] Be careful.
- [James] Yes, sir.

34:26.467 --> 34:28.500
[instrumental music playing]

34:28.533 --> 34:33.700
[narrator] In his last dive,
Carlos found the sidewalls
of the ancient plunge pool.

34:35.100 --> 34:39.167
James's mission:
get through a layer of gravel

34:39.200 --> 34:41.933
and identify
the downstream bedrock steps,

34:42.767 --> 34:44.800
which Dustin
hopes will lead them

34:44.833 --> 34:49.067
to the bottom of the plunge
pool and a monster
pile of gold.

34:51.367 --> 34:55.233
-[Dustin] Don't go too deep.
Just keep digging.
- [James] Yep.

34:55.267 --> 34:57.967
I got a lot of work to do,
but it's looking good.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.533
[Carlos] He's getting
things done.

35:01.567 --> 35:03.767
He's getting things
taken care of.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.267
And the best thing is,
if he keeps going deeper,

35:06.300 --> 35:08.733
the more chances
of bigger gold.

35:08.767 --> 35:10.400
More gold is gonna be there.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.533
[James] That basket is full.

35:15.433 --> 35:16.433
Basket up!

35:20.067 --> 35:22.300
[James] I'm just
tearing it down. Yes!

35:24.833 --> 35:26.967
I'm loving this.
I feel good about this.

35:27.733 --> 35:28.967
I'm chomping at the bit

35:29.067 --> 35:30.900
to get some
frickin' gold, man.

35:30.933 --> 35:32.267
[Dustin] That's awesome, man.

35:35.167 --> 35:37.067
[narrator] After two hours,

35:37.100 --> 35:39.667
James has dredged 4 feet down.

35:42.767 --> 35:45.300
[James] There's that wall
starting to go across.

35:45.333 --> 35:48.400
[Dustin] So is your giant ball
of dirt... Is it, uh...

35:48.433 --> 35:50.433
Is it vertical or sloping?

35:51.167 --> 35:52.067
[James] Vertical.

35:54.333 --> 35:55.967
Does that sound safe to you?

35:56.667 --> 35:58.067
This boulder's in...

35:59.733 --> 36:01.133
[Dustin] Can you hear me,
James?

36:01.667 --> 36:03.500
[indistinct]

36:05.067 --> 36:06.533
[Dustin] You can't hear me?

36:06.567 --> 36:07.767
[Carlos] The mine shaft.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.867
He's booby trapping himself,
dude.

36:09.900 --> 36:12.133
I know. I can't stop him.

36:12.167 --> 36:16.067
[Carlos] He's about to bring
the whole [bleep] down, dude.
[bleep] vertical wall.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.700
No vertical walls!
No vertical walls.

36:22.667 --> 36:24.200
[Dustin] Hey, James?

36:24.233 --> 36:25.467
[James] Yes, sir?

36:27.067 --> 36:29.367
[Dustin] Make sure you don't
go any deeper, all right?

36:29.400 --> 36:30.767
[James] Yeah.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.400
[Dustin] Don't go any deeper.

36:32.433 --> 36:36.733
If you do anything,
do not go deeper. All right?

36:38.867 --> 36:42.267
[narrator] Instead of removing
the dirt in layers,

36:42.300 --> 36:47.067
racing to get to the gold,
James has dug straight down

36:47.067 --> 36:52.767
leaving a steep upstream
gravel wall that threatens
to collapse at any time.

36:55.367 --> 36:57.167
burying him alive.

37:00.933 --> 37:03.167
This is what gold fever
does sometimes.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.867
You just wanna get the gold

37:04.900 --> 37:07.967
and you're not paying
attention to what the hell
you're doing, you know?

37:10.267 --> 37:12.800
[Dustin] Don't go too deep
or that wall will collapse
on you.

37:12.833 --> 37:13.700
[James] All right.

37:16.933 --> 37:19.867
[Dustin] One surge
and it'll ruin your life, man.
I mean,

37:19.900 --> 37:22.567
It would take me two days
to get you from underneath
that stuff.

37:23.533 --> 37:26.133
You just don't want
that to happen.

37:26.167 --> 37:30.367
[James] Got it. I have to go
from wall to wall.
Sounds beautiful.

37:32.067 --> 37:34.067
[narrator] Taking
Dustin's advice,

37:34.067 --> 37:36.767
James gets back
to dredging in layers,

37:36.800 --> 37:40.867
searching for the downstream
steps that leads to
the plunge pool.

37:41.933 --> 37:42.900
[Dustin] Come up.

37:44.267 --> 37:45.133
[James] Copy.

37:46.700 --> 37:48.200
[Dustin] Some good size rocks,
man.

37:48.233 --> 37:50.567
[James] Yeah, dude.
Getting them out of here.

37:51.567 --> 37:52.833
We're getting somewhere.

37:53.967 --> 37:56.967
I'm very excited about it.
I'm loving this.

37:57.067 --> 37:58.900
-Dustin.
-[Dustin] Copy.

37:58.933 --> 38:02.400
[James] I recognize the steps
that I saw last year.

38:02.433 --> 38:04.667
I'm down to, like,
those three steps again,

38:04.700 --> 38:06.567
and there's a big rock
down there.

38:08.200 --> 38:12.200
[narrator] James has finally
uncovered the downstream
bedrock steps

38:12.233 --> 38:15.733
which Dustin hopes will lead
to a massive pay day.

38:17.900 --> 38:20.600
I hope there's so much gold
at the bottom of this thing

38:20.633 --> 38:23.167
it changes our life forever.

38:38.367 --> 38:40.600
[Dustin] Hey, Kayla.
What're you doing?

38:40.633 --> 38:43.867
[Kayla] I'm trying to get
good-sized ones so we can just
pick them off out of it.

38:43.900 --> 38:47.367
[narrator] Kayla is moments
away from seeing

38:47.400 --> 38:50.967
if her sluice box extension
has caught any gold.

38:53.667 --> 38:57.400
Ah, the sound of a trommel
on a cool Alaskan morning.

38:59.667 --> 39:01.500
[imitates trommel]

39:02.300 --> 39:03.300
It's got a good beat.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.800
[laughs]

39:05.833 --> 39:07.900
Beautiful. Look at
those little pieces.

39:09.133 --> 39:10.567
Should just keep getting
better and better.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.600
[Wes] It's beautiful.

39:11.633 --> 39:13.433
[Kayla] To see this
chunky of gold

39:14.467 --> 39:15.367
this early

39:17.267 --> 39:19.767
is definitely a good sign
that it should be good
when we get down.

39:19.800 --> 39:21.200
That's sexy.

39:21.833 --> 39:22.867
Sexy gold.

39:22.900 --> 39:23.867
[chuckles]

39:36.667 --> 39:37.900
[Dustin] Hey, y'all.

39:37.933 --> 39:39.600
-[Wes] Hey.
-[James] Check this out, dude.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.467
[narrator] After a week
of setbacks...

39:43.333 --> 39:44.700
[Dustin] Holy crap!

39:45.233 --> 39:47.067
Damn.

39:47.067 --> 39:50.600
[narrator] ...Kayla is looking
for a win from her
sluice box extension.

39:51.367 --> 39:52.667
Wow.

39:53.467 --> 39:55.067
That's that shiny stuff.

39:57.300 --> 39:58.800
-Look at that.
-[Kayla] That's a lot
of fines.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.167
[narrator] Using only
one dredge,

40:02.200 --> 40:05.700
Kayla's crew is pulling
more gold than Dustin.

40:05.733 --> 40:09.133
[Kayla] The first clean up
barely had that much
fine gold, like, right there.

40:09.167 --> 40:11.133
-[James] Yeah.
-[Wes] Look how shiny it is.

40:11.167 --> 40:13.000
[Kayla] So we added
an extension to it

40:13.033 --> 40:15.200
and look how much more fines
it's catching.

40:15.233 --> 40:17.833
-So you were losing fines?
-We were losing gold
like crazy.

40:17.867 --> 40:19.267
[James] That is a lot
of fines.

40:19.300 --> 40:21.333
[Dustin] You're not at
the bottom yet.
That's the important stuff.

40:21.367 --> 40:22.900
-[Wes] Yes.
-[Kayla] Yeah.

40:22.933 --> 40:24.467
[Dustin] Not at the
bottom because all the gold's
gonna be at the bottom.

40:24.500 --> 40:25.867
[Kayla] That's over an ounce
right there.

40:25.900 --> 40:26.900
[Dustin] It's picking up.

40:26.933 --> 40:28.900
-[man] Yeah.
-Well, good for you guys.

40:28.933 --> 40:30.800
[James] You guys will hit it
down there in
the chute though.

40:32.067 --> 40:33.933
We're, uh, still not paying
for the gas,

40:33.967 --> 40:35.267
but you guys are
getting closer.

40:35.300 --> 40:36.133
I can feel it.

40:36.167 --> 40:37.167
[man] Yeah.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.333
-[man] Awesome.
-[Dustin] Nice job.

40:38.367 --> 40:39.767
-[man] Good job.
-[Carlos] Nice job. That's...

40:39.800 --> 40:41.433
-Damn.
-[Carlos]...beautiful gold.

40:41.467 --> 40:43.600
Yes, we were losing
gold previously,

40:43.633 --> 40:45.767
but now we've corrected
that problem.

40:45.800 --> 40:48.467
And so it just gives us
a little bit peace of mind.

40:50.400 --> 40:52.000
[Dustin] Little bit on
the desperate side.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.433
They're at an ounce and

40:53.467 --> 40:55.367
we found one little picker.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.467
And the chute has gold in it.

40:58.433 --> 41:00.300
So we gotta get there.

41:00.333 --> 41:04.100
What we really need is to get
down to bedrock and find out
what's down there.

41:08.333 --> 41:09.500
We doin' it?

41:09.533 --> 41:10.667
Go. Let's go.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.467
[narrator] Desperate
for results,

41:16.500 --> 41:20.067
Dustin's crew dive for
the last time this week

41:20.067 --> 41:24.267
to see if they can turn around
their fortunes and find
some gold.

41:27.667 --> 41:28.633
[Dustin] We're back.

41:28.667 --> 41:30.467
We know there's
gold down here.

41:30.500 --> 41:34.767
We got the long hose
from the other site.
Reach farther.

41:34.800 --> 41:35.933
It's gonna make
everything better.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.667
I feel hopeful.

41:37.700 --> 41:39.567
I'm hopeful that
we're gonna get gold.

41:41.133 --> 41:42.133
That's the plan.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.700
[Carlos] We all wanna
finish this hole.

41:45.733 --> 41:49.167
Yardage, yardage, yardage.
He's gonna kill himself
trying to get yardage.

41:49.200 --> 41:52.200
As of right now,
there's gold in there,
I know it for a fact,

41:52.233 --> 41:55.533
at the very, very bottom.

41:55.567 --> 41:58.600
So anything that's on top
of that has at come out.

41:58.633 --> 42:01.500
We can't go through another
winter with not finishing
this hole.

42:10.233 --> 42:12.500
-[Wes] Have a great
dive today.
-[Dustin] Oh, I hope so.

42:12.533 --> 42:15.067
[Wes] Move a lot of material.
That's the main thing.

42:16.067 --> 42:17.233
[Dustin] This will do.

42:29.867 --> 42:31.433
[narrator] Dustin's mission:

42:31.467 --> 42:34.900
get through the last layer
of river gravels and into

42:34.933 --> 42:38.533
the ancient plunge pool
where the nuggets
should've collected.

42:40.900 --> 42:42.500
[groans]

42:42.533 --> 42:43.967
[man] What was that?

42:44.067 --> 42:46.067
[Dustin] Ah, my [bleep].

42:46.100 --> 42:48.200
Ah, come on. Come on.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.567
[Carlos] Frickin' engine died.

42:49.600 --> 42:53.300
No hot water.
Diver's got no hot water.

42:53.333 --> 42:57.067
[narrator] The engine that
supplies the hot water
to the diver has turned off...

42:58.067 --> 42:59.400
[Carlos] What is the problem?

42:59.433 --> 43:01.067
[Dustin] Come on, hot water.

43:01.067 --> 43:05.467
[narrator] ...leaving Dustin
diving in water just 3 degrees
above freezing.

43:06.533 --> 43:10.333
[exclaims] [bleep]
It hurts, too.

43:10.367 --> 43:13.900
-[screeches]
-[Dustin] Ugh. [bleep]

43:15.933 --> 43:17.533
Oh, my [bleep].

43:18.833 --> 43:21.267
[narrator] They must restart
the engine quickly

43:21.300 --> 43:24.567
or Dustin will be forced
to abandon his dive.

43:25.167 --> 43:26.967
[groans]

43:27.067 --> 43:29.067
-[screeches]
-[Dustin] Ugh.

43:34.067 --> 43:37.267
[man] We got it.
The hot water should
be working fine.

43:38.200 --> 43:39.700
[Dustin] That's more like it.

43:42.100 --> 43:45.600
[narrator] The hot water now
flowing down to Dustin,

43:45.633 --> 43:49.733
he can try to locate
the upstream wall
of the plunge pool.

43:49.767 --> 43:53.100
It should lead them
down to gold.

43:53.133 --> 43:54.667
[Carlos] We're getting
a lot of flow.

43:54.700 --> 43:57.267
Dustin's in there right now
getting a lot of material

43:57.300 --> 43:59.167
dredged out of the way.

43:59.200 --> 44:03.233
[Carlos] Your mission for
today is to find that
upstream wall.

44:04.667 --> 44:05.833
So far, so good.

44:08.867 --> 44:11.167
Yeah, you got a big-ass pile
behind you already.

44:14.633 --> 44:16.567
Oh, you just had a huge one
come through.

44:18.267 --> 44:20.300
[Carlos] So far,
things are going great.

44:20.333 --> 44:23.933
With this new hose,
he's digging like no tomorrow.

44:23.967 --> 44:25.967
He's digging like we should
be digging.

44:28.800 --> 44:31.967
Hey, Dustin.
How deep do you think
you've got down there now?

44:32.567 --> 44:34.967
[Dustin] [static] Uh,

44:35.600 --> 44:37.167
hard to guess right now.

44:38.567 --> 44:40.067
Probably about 8 feet.

44:40.100 --> 44:42.367
[Wes] How much have you
uncovered from what
we had last year?

44:42.400 --> 44:43.433
[Dustin] Uh...

44:44.467 --> 44:45.600
Well...

44:45.633 --> 44:47.067
I did dig down pretty deep.

44:47.100 --> 44:48.600
-Yeah.
-[breathing over radio]

44:48.633 --> 44:51.300
[Dustin] There's a substantial
wall in front of me.

44:53.233 --> 44:57.367
It's that upstream wall.
It's just a big wall.

44:57.400 --> 44:58.833
[Carlos] Hell yeah, dude!

44:58.867 --> 45:02.433
We're finally back on it now.
Whoo-hoo!

45:02.467 --> 45:05.733
[narrator] Dustin and his crew
have finally exposed all four

45:05.767 --> 45:07.833
bedrock walls of
the plunge pool.

45:09.233 --> 45:13.100
Now, it's a straight shot down
to what they hope is

45:13.133 --> 45:15.133
a life-changing deposit
of gold.

45:15.167 --> 45:18.600
-[Wes] You gotta be pretty
close to 8 feet deep then.
-[Dustin] Yeah.

45:18.633 --> 45:21.333
Just cleaning bedrock
as I go upstream, man.

45:21.367 --> 45:24.500
[Wes] You're still coming
across small rocks, right?
No boulders yet?

45:24.533 --> 45:26.533
[Dustin] Not yet. No.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.067
[Dustin] Oh, [bleep].

45:31.067 --> 45:32.067
What's up?

45:33.133 --> 45:34.867
[Dustin] Oh, [bleep].

45:37.067 --> 45:39.067
[Wes] Are you all right, man?
What's going on?

45:39.067 --> 45:40.800
[Dustin] Something's standing
up on deck.

45:46.900 --> 45:49.233
[Dustin] Tell me if that's
gold or not. I can't tell.

45:50.800 --> 45:51.733
Whoo!

45:54.300 --> 45:55.800
Oh, my [bleep]!

45:55.833 --> 45:57.067
[Carlos] What, what, what?

45:57.067 --> 45:58.533
[James] Look at that!

45:59.133 --> 46:00.967
Hell yeah!

46:01.067 --> 46:02.800
[Wes] Holy [bleep]

46:02.833 --> 46:05.233
Oh, my [bleep]!

46:05.267 --> 46:07.233
What the heck, man?

46:07.267 --> 46:10.367
-[Wes] Good job.
-[Carlos] Whoo-hoo!

46:10.400 --> 46:15.200
[James] Wow. Awesome.
It's gonna be a big payday.
[chuckles]

46:15.233 --> 46:18.267
-Good job.
-[Carlos] That's like
a quarter ounce, man.

46:18.300 --> 46:20.100
We're back on the gold.

46:20.133 --> 46:22.533
[Dustin] [bleep] , dude.
It was such a surprise
this time.

46:22.567 --> 46:23.733
It was like,
"Are you kidding me?"

46:23.767 --> 46:26.133
It was the most convincing
white rock I've ever seen,

46:26.167 --> 46:27.533
but it wouldn't go
in the nozzle.

46:27.567 --> 46:28.867
I was like, "No way."

46:29.900 --> 46:31.767
[Carlos] Yeah! Yeah.

46:32.400 --> 46:33.467
I love it.

46:33.500 --> 46:34.933
[James] Good dive.
Damn good dive.

46:34.967 --> 46:36.300
[laughs]

46:38.833 --> 46:40.133
[Dustin] I needed that, man.

46:40.167 --> 46:41.433
[James] So did I.

46:41.467 --> 46:42.533
[Dustin] I needed that.

46:42.567 --> 46:44.167
-I bet. Because today--
-I haven't...

46:44.200 --> 46:46.533
I think we haven't seen
gold all season.

46:46.567 --> 46:48.367
I know. It was scary.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.467
[Carlos] Dude...

46:49.500 --> 46:50.933
Quarter ounce nugget.

46:50.967 --> 46:53.567
Now, we have hope.
Hope is back.

46:53.600 --> 46:57.067
[narrator] After nearly four
months risking their lives

46:57.100 --> 47:00.067
without seeing a dollar
in return,

47:00.100 --> 47:03.767
Dustin's crew is finally
on the gold.

47:03.800 --> 47:05.400
[Dustin] That nugget was
something else.

47:05.433 --> 47:07.100
Just sitting there.
Just beautiful.

47:07.733 --> 47:09.967
Bang. Beautiful.

47:10.067 --> 47:15.067
It was sitting there going,
"Hello. I'm down here.
I've been waiting on you.

47:15.067 --> 47:16.767
I'm the nugget you've
been waiting for."

47:18.267 --> 47:20.233
Oh, I needed to see that.

47:22.433 --> 47:23.600
What's at the bottom?

47:30.933 --> 47:33.800
[narrator] On the next
Gold Rush: White Water...

47:33.833 --> 47:34.700
[Kayla] What the hell?

47:36.500 --> 47:38.867
[James] The whole engine is
on fire.

47:38.900 --> 47:40.867
Dustin, get the [bleep]
out of here.

47:40.900 --> 47:42.067
Fast.

47:42.333 --> 47:43.967
[screams]

47:44.067 --> 47:45.233
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

47:45.900 --> 47:47.467
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

47:47.500 --> 47:48.400
[grunts]

47:48.433 --> 47:49.533
[Wes] It's taking me.

47:49.567 --> 47:50.667
[exclaims]

47:51.833 --> 47:53.100
[man] I don't have
any hot water.

47:53.133 --> 47:54.767
[Kayla] Get the [bleep]
out of there.

47:54.800 --> 47:57.233
That's getting to the point
of hypothermic.

47:57.267 --> 47:59.067
[Kayla] What the...
The [bleep] string broke.

47:59.067 --> 48:00.400
[bleep]

48:00.433 --> 48:02.500
[man] We dredge till the end.

48:03.600 --> 48:05.100
Oh, yeah! Look at that.

48:05.133 --> 48:06.433
Whoo-hoo!

48:06.467 --> 48:08.200
Yeah! We're back.
