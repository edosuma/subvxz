00:34.373 --> 00:35.672
Your mother and I have
dinner reservations,

00:35.674 --> 00:37.440
so you kids are
on your own tonight.

00:37.442 --> 00:40.043
<i>Fine. I'll just order
pizza or something.</i>

00:40.045 --> 00:42.279
So, what's this restaurant
you're taking us to

00:42.281 --> 00:43.716
out in the middle of nowhere?

00:44.382 --> 00:46.216
New Belgian Fusion.

00:46.218 --> 00:47.885
- Oh.
- No, no pizza, honey.

00:47.887 --> 00:49.786
That is just full
of fat and carbs.

00:49.788 --> 00:51.088
You know what?

00:51.090 --> 00:53.123
There is a quinoa broccoli
casserole in the fridge.

00:53.125 --> 00:54.458
<i>Of course there is.</i>

00:54.460 --> 00:56.693
"This hidden gem
boasts magnificent views

00:56.695 --> 00:57.961
that are worth the drive..."

00:57.963 --> 00:59.096
And the food?

01:00.132 --> 01:01.365
I'm getting there.

01:01.367 --> 01:03.033
Hey, Becky, listen
to your mother.

01:03.035 --> 01:05.001
That's a healthier choice.

01:05.004 --> 01:08.205
- We'll be home later tonight.
- <i>Whatever.</i>

01:09.607 --> 01:11.909
You know that fat-ass just
called Dominos right now.

01:11.911 --> 01:13.110
You're absolutely right.

01:13.112 --> 01:15.712
"Serving a menu of
farm-to-table Belgian fare

01:15.714 --> 01:18.582
that artfully surprises
and tickles the senses."

01:18.584 --> 01:21.218
Jesus! She's morbidly
obese and stupid.

01:21.220 --> 01:22.953
We're gonna be stuck
with her forever.

01:22.955 --> 01:25.087
And don't even get me started
on Mr. Fancypants.

01:25.089 --> 01:27.423
Do you know I caught him using
my fucking eyeliner again?

01:27.425 --> 01:28.891
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

01:28.893 --> 01:31.527
"It's a culinary experience
for the ages."

01:31.529 --> 01:32.895
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

01:32.897 --> 01:34.398
Can we not talk about
the kids right now?

01:35.733 --> 01:36.934
We have the whole
evening to ourselves.

01:36.936 --> 01:38.201
You're right.

01:38.203 --> 01:41.604
A night free from ungrateful,
underachieving teenagers.

01:41.606 --> 01:42.638
Ah.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.341
We'll just pretend
they're dead.

01:47.579 --> 01:49.681
Oh, it would be amazing.

01:51.716 --> 01:53.783
How many stars?

01:53.785 --> 01:55.653
Five stars,
across the board.

02:05.763 --> 02:08.065
<i>Will Fitzgibbon, one of
the two hikers who came across</i>

02:08.067 --> 02:09.166
<i>the wrecked SUV...</i>

02:09.168 --> 02:10.366
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

02:10.369 --> 02:11.600
<i>...is clearly still shaken
by the experience.</i>

02:11.602 --> 02:13.069
That is a body bag.

02:13.071 --> 02:14.737
<i>"There were body parts
everywhere," he said.</i>

02:14.739 --> 02:17.073
<i>My cousin Jared is
still throwing up."</i>

02:17.075 --> 02:19.208
<i>More to come as a search
for the identity</i>

02:19.210 --> 02:20.843
<i>of the victims continues.</i>

02:20.845 --> 02:23.145
<i>This is your on-the-scene
reporter, Sally McDuffy,</i>

02:23.147 --> 02:25.614
<i>KFT, Channel Five News.</i>

02:25.616 --> 02:28.484
You don't need me for this.
It's a car accident.

02:28.486 --> 02:29.685
Chief asked for you
specifically,

02:29.687 --> 02:31.554
and she also said that
when you complain,

02:31.556 --> 02:32.822
to tell you that
you're not too good

02:32.824 --> 02:34.757
to do regular
police work.

02:34.759 --> 02:36.225
Shit.

02:36.227 --> 02:37.494
Now what do we got?

02:38.997 --> 02:40.296
Oh, shit.

02:40.298 --> 02:41.397
I know, what an
asshole, right?

02:41.399 --> 02:43.199
No, I know the plate.
Call it in.

02:43.201 --> 02:44.700
It's Dan Wallace.

02:44.702 --> 02:46.501
His kids go to school
with my son.

02:46.503 --> 02:49.372
It's probably his wife, too.

02:49.374 --> 02:50.840
I'm sorry, Cliff.

02:50.842 --> 02:52.141
It's "Detective".

02:52.143 --> 02:54.810
You know, listen,
get the department shrink to meet me

02:54.812 --> 02:56.712
at the station in an hour
and get an official

02:56.714 --> 02:58.514
from Washington High
on the phone.

02:58.516 --> 03:00.949
I gotta get grandparent
or guardian information

03:00.951 --> 03:02.586
on those kids.

03:05.156 --> 03:06.391
Now, Sam.

03:10.028 --> 03:11.496
Shit.

03:13.697 --> 03:16.365
Funeral arrangements are
being set for Tuesday.

03:16.367 --> 03:19.902
Don't be afraid to talk to
your friends about their loss.

03:19.904 --> 03:23.541
Sometimes all they're looking
for is someone to listen.

03:25.275 --> 03:26.810
Yes, Reagan.

03:31.014 --> 03:34.015
I just wanted to remind
everyone that donations

03:34.017 --> 03:36.851
for the "Ben and Becky Wallace
Fund" are now being accepted.

03:36.853 --> 03:38.187
You can donate
in the school office

03:38.189 --> 03:40.222
or we've also set up a website.

03:40.224 --> 03:41.924
HelpBenAndBeckyWallace.com.

03:41.926 --> 03:44.026
What the hell do
they need money for?

03:44.028 --> 03:46.529
Didn't their parents drive
like an $80,000 SUV?

03:46.531 --> 03:48.263
Yeah, they're like
super-wealth...

03:48.265 --> 03:50.432
Hey!
Would you guys shut up?

03:50.434 --> 03:51.866
Reagan's talking.

03:51.868 --> 03:53.601
I'm just saying
they're already rich.

03:53.603 --> 03:55.937
What's going on there?

03:55.939 --> 03:58.474
Reagan deserves
our undivided attention.

03:58.476 --> 04:01.210
Thank you, Miss P.

04:01.212 --> 04:04.712
I just want everyone to
think about Ben and Becky.

04:04.714 --> 04:08.486
Every donation counts,
no matter how small.

04:10.455 --> 04:11.955
Thank you all
for coming today.

04:13.824 --> 04:15.525
I know they would have
appreciated it.

04:17.726 --> 04:19.596
What can I say
about our parents?

04:21.832 --> 04:25.166
They were the warmest,
most caring,

04:25.168 --> 04:26.603
supportive people.

04:29.139 --> 04:30.841
They loved to travel.

04:32.109 --> 04:34.143
Whale watching in Aruba,

04:34.145 --> 04:36.643
gallery hopping in Paris,

04:36.645 --> 04:39.380
wine tasting in Sonoma.

04:39.382 --> 04:43.351
Of course, usually they
would go by themselves,

04:43.353 --> 04:46.690
but, um,
they'd always come back.

04:49.594 --> 04:50.794
Just not this time.

04:52.597 --> 04:54.430
Thank you so much
for coming.

04:54.432 --> 04:55.732
Thank you.

04:59.604 --> 05:02.137
I am so sorry
for your loss.

05:02.139 --> 05:03.138
Thank you, Mr. Dawkins.

05:03.140 --> 05:04.606
I didn't know
your parents well,

05:04.608 --> 05:06.474
but I liked them.

05:06.476 --> 05:09.843
I wanted to say thank you
for the Edible Arrangements.

05:09.845 --> 05:11.946
It's no problem.
It's my pleasure.

05:11.948 --> 05:13.984
Thank you so much for coming.

05:14.985 --> 05:17.385
We really just...

05:17.387 --> 05:18.855
Oh, um...

05:21.458 --> 05:22.859
Okay.

05:25.327 --> 05:26.394
Okay.

05:26.396 --> 05:27.629
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

05:27.631 --> 05:29.696
- It's all right.
- Okay.

05:29.698 --> 05:32.467
All right.
All right. Okay.

05:32.469 --> 05:34.169
- Okay.
- Thanks.

05:34.171 --> 05:36.005
Be well.
Be well.

05:39.576 --> 05:40.776
- Pull it together.
- Okay.

06:09.606 --> 06:11.672
Ow. Shit.

06:11.674 --> 06:13.540
Oh, my God.
Get the...

06:13.542 --> 06:14.975
Eat your fucking food.
Right now.

06:14.977 --> 06:16.810
- You're pulling too hard!
- Get up, you little shit, get the fuck up.

06:16.812 --> 06:18.045
Eat your fucking burger.
Come on!

06:18.047 --> 06:20.013
So Briggs has
this new paralegal.

06:20.015 --> 06:21.848
Dude, I stood behind her
in the elevator,

06:21.850 --> 06:23.451
you have got to see the
turd-cutter on this chick.

06:23.453 --> 06:25.018
Oh, my God it's ama...

06:25.020 --> 06:27.287
It's okay, we're talking
about Mommy. It's okay.

06:27.289 --> 06:29.856
So, anyway, yeah, dude, it's...

06:29.858 --> 06:31.892
- I... dammit, Kailee!
- Oh, my gosh.

06:31.894 --> 06:32.893
What the hell? Again...

06:32.895 --> 06:34.529
Greg, I gotta call you back.

06:34.531 --> 06:36.762
They have telethons for kids
that don't spill as much as you.

06:36.764 --> 06:40.100
Oh that's it, cry.
Yeah, cry just like Mommy.

06:40.102 --> 06:41.337
Yeah.

06:50.647 --> 06:51.778
Great meal, honey.

06:51.780 --> 06:53.113
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

06:53.115 --> 06:55.816
Honey, how are those
Wallace kids doing?

06:55.818 --> 06:57.251
You know, the ones
that lost their parents?

06:57.253 --> 06:59.952
Oh, um, uh, they're
hanging in there.

06:59.954 --> 07:01.988
Ben actually just turned
18 a couple days ago,

07:01.990 --> 07:03.624
so I think he's
gonna petition

07:03.626 --> 07:06.360
to become Becky's
legal guardian.

07:06.362 --> 07:07.728
Wow.

07:07.730 --> 07:09.730
- That's a big responsibility.
- Mm-hmm.

07:09.732 --> 07:11.465
I mean, won't that affect
his college options?

07:11.467 --> 07:13.734
I guess they're just seeing
how everything goes day by day.

07:13.736 --> 07:15.569
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

07:15.571 --> 07:17.771
Um, if it's okay
with you guys,

07:17.773 --> 07:19.676
I was thinking about
maybe going out tonight?

07:21.578 --> 07:23.343
Tom Mulnick is having a party.

07:23.345 --> 07:25.811
A party?

07:25.813 --> 07:27.146
Will there be girls?

07:27.148 --> 07:29.283
Yes, Mom, there will be girls.

07:30.552 --> 07:31.817
Tom Mulnick?

07:31.819 --> 07:33.186
I've never heard you
mention him before.

07:33.188 --> 07:34.854
No, he's just a...

07:34.856 --> 07:35.855
friend from school.

07:35.857 --> 07:36.989
I tutor him sometimes.

07:36.991 --> 07:40.694
Oh, oh, will there,
uh, be alcohol?

07:40.696 --> 07:42.696
Probably.

07:42.698 --> 07:44.631
But you know
my philosophy with that.

07:44.633 --> 07:46.433
When have I ever let you down?

07:46.435 --> 07:47.668
- Never.
- Nope.

07:47.670 --> 07:49.302
Go! Have fun.

07:49.304 --> 07:50.704
Yeah. Have a good time.

07:50.706 --> 07:52.872
All right. Hm, cool.
See you guys later.

07:52.874 --> 07:54.175
- All right.
- Okay.

07:57.278 --> 07:59.111
A party with
drinking and girls.

07:59.113 --> 08:00.714

acting his age.

Yeah, it's okay.

without any ice.

the garage, Dad.

you wanna dance?

09:58.331 --> 10:00.433
No, thanks.

10:00.435 --> 10:01.935
I like your personality.

10:04.806 --> 10:06.138
What a jerk-off.

10:06.140 --> 10:08.309
He had some pretty
sweet moves, though.

10:09.143 --> 10:10.443
Surprised to see you here.

10:10.445 --> 10:12.243
Yeah?
Why's that?

10:12.245 --> 10:15.380
Well, you just don't strike me
as the high school kegger type.

10:15.382 --> 10:18.483
Oh, come on, I'm just
expanding my horizons.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.487
Expand them more
and dance with me.

10:21.923 --> 10:25.524
Thanks, but I'm not
much of a dancer.

10:25.526 --> 10:26.993
Well, lucky for you I am.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.815
Just hanging out
with my dudes.

11:23.817 --> 11:24.983
I'm hungry for a hotdog.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.218
Guess who I am?

11:27.621 --> 11:29.019
Guess who I am!

11:29.021 --> 11:32.524
Edward Forty Hands!

11:32.526 --> 11:33.591
Mmm.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.195
Ugh.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.830
Hey.
Who wants to fuck?

11:38.832 --> 11:40.267
Get outta here!
Hyah!

11:43.837 --> 11:46.271
So sensitive.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.438
- See ya, man.
- Thanks, dude.

11:48.440 --> 11:49.406
Eh.

11:49.408 --> 11:52.077
Next one's gonna
be even crazier.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.150
Can somebody get me a beverage?

12:03.957 --> 12:06.391
Thanks, man.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.561
You got class.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.743
I think that's everybody.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.879
Mind giving me
a ride home?

12:27.881 --> 12:29.112
You didn't drive?

12:29.114 --> 12:30.582
I didn't tonight.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.916
All right.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.284
Here, let me tell
my da...

12:33.286 --> 12:34.654
Eh, you know what,
fuck it. Let's go.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.943
It looks like it was
a pretty rad party.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.143
Man, back when
I was in high school...

13:01.145 --> 13:03.714
You do realize that
somebody died, right, Sam?

13:03.716 --> 13:05.782
Just... wait, where
did you get those?

13:05.784 --> 13:07.851
Over there.

13:07.853 --> 13:10.320
Those could be evidence.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.656
Just, go do
something useful.

13:12.658 --> 13:14.693
Go check the hot tub.

13:28.107 --> 13:29.673
I'm so sorry, Tom.

13:29.675 --> 13:32.311
Do you have any relatives
that we can contact?

13:34.813 --> 13:36.680
My grandma.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.548
But could you let me
call her please?

13:38.550 --> 13:39.850
It's...

13:39.852 --> 13:41.184
Oh, God.

13:41.186 --> 13:42.486
This is gonna kill her.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.820
Yeah, of course,
whatever you need.

13:43.822 --> 13:46.256
Uh, hey, Cliff, I, uh,
found this in the hot tub.

13:46.258 --> 13:47.757
Did you want me to bag it?

13:47.759 --> 13:50.526
Dad probably drank that when
I left to take my friend home.

13:50.528 --> 13:52.062
Not supposed to.

13:52.064 --> 13:53.664
He's on medication.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.498
Oh, what type of medication?

13:55.500 --> 14:00.904
Hyd... hyd...
hydrochlorothiazide.

14:00.906 --> 14:03.172
He has UTIs.

14:03.174 --> 14:06.376
UTIs, yeah, alcohol,
diuretics in a hot tub.

14:06.378 --> 14:08.380
That's killed more people
than you'd believe.

14:09.815 --> 14:11.547
So, y... you did want me
to bag this?

14:11.549 --> 14:12.548
No.

14:12.550 --> 14:14.483
Sa... hot water
and chlorine, Sam?

14:14.485 --> 14:16.019
It's not gonna be
anything but clean.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.319
Oh.

14:17.321 --> 14:20.191
Just put it down.
Please go do something else.

14:24.763 --> 14:26.228
Sorry.

14:26.230 --> 14:29.468
He's just...
he's a fuckin' idiot.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.074
Next.

14:38.543 --> 14:39.775
Hey, so?

14:39.777 --> 14:41.144
It's okay.
It's fine.

14:41.146 --> 14:42.145
Are they gonna
tell our parents?

14:42.147 --> 14:43.713
Relax.

14:43.715 --> 14:45.514
They just want to know
what happened to Tom's dad.

14:45.516 --> 14:47.818
<i>My tub, my rules.
Now, let him in!</i>

14:48.821 --> 14:50.020
- Ew!
- Oh.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.320
We tried our best
to contain it,

14:51.322 --> 14:53.289
but most of the videos
have gone viral.

14:53.291 --> 14:54.791
<i>Just hanging out
with my dudes.</i>

14:54.793 --> 14:55.792
Oh.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.259
Oh! Oh-okay.

14:57.261 --> 14:58.695
I think we... I think
we've seen enough, Sam.

14:58.697 --> 14:59.929
- Oh.
- <i>I'm hungry for a hot dog.</i>

14:59.931 --> 15:01.296
Well, it didn't come from me.

15:01.298 --> 15:03.399
- I don't even own a cell phone.
- Really?

15:03.401 --> 15:05.835
I've never heard of a high school
kid that doesn't own a cell phone.

15:05.837 --> 15:08.537
Refreshing is what it is,
but frankly, Reagan,

15:08.539 --> 15:11.607
I'm surprised you'd even be
at a party like this.

15:11.609 --> 15:13.542
Mrs. Reed, you can go
to a party without drinking

15:13.544 --> 15:14.844
or doing drugs.

15:14.846 --> 15:16.812
Isn't that what you've
drilled us on for years now?

15:16.814 --> 15:18.183
I mean, give me a break.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.251
I'm... sorry.

15:22.253 --> 15:23.485
That was disrespectful.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.386
It's all right, Reagan,
we understand.

15:25.388 --> 15:28.758
It's been very stressful
for everyone.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.093
Detective...

15:31.095 --> 15:34.430
Uh, hi, Reagan, uh,
my name is Detective Dawkins.

15:34.432 --> 15:37.166
Nice to meet you.
This is Officer Pickett.

15:37.168 --> 15:39.101
Uh, I have seen you
somewhere before, haven't I?

15:39.103 --> 15:42.139
Uh, yes, sir.
At the Wallace funeral.

15:42.141 --> 15:44.273
Ben and Becky told me how
much of a big help you were.

15:44.275 --> 15:47.877
Oh, well,
they friends of yours?

15:47.879 --> 15:51.479
Well, actually, Reagan
almost single-handedly

15:51.481 --> 15:54.784
put together the student
support effort for them.

15:54.786 --> 15:56.518
Well, I appreciate that.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.453
All this must be
hard on you, too.

15:58.455 --> 16:00.723
Three friends losing their
parents so close together.

16:00.725 --> 16:02.794
I just want to help
out any way I can.

16:03.961 --> 16:05.628
Sixty percent?

16:05.630 --> 16:06.862
As agreed.

16:06.864 --> 16:09.199
You want one?

16:09.201 --> 16:10.766
No.

16:10.768 --> 16:13.334
So, I'm taking most of my
commission out in cash.

16:13.336 --> 16:15.837
The rest I'll collect from
the insurance payouts.

16:15.839 --> 16:17.438
And the online account?

16:17.440 --> 16:19.108
You've been emptying
it daily, right?

16:19.110 --> 16:20.642
Yeah. Just like you said.

16:20.644 --> 16:21.709
Great.

16:21.711 --> 16:23.511
What about the envelope
that I told you

16:23.513 --> 16:24.747
not to open 'til we're done.

16:24.749 --> 16:26.217
Yeah. Hold on.

16:30.288 --> 16:32.488
When: house party.
Where: hot tub.

16:32.490 --> 16:35.824
How: hydrochlorothiazide
and a forty.

16:35.826 --> 16:37.392
Unbelievable.

16:37.394 --> 16:39.329
What do I do with this?

16:47.939 --> 16:50.471
Wow.

16:50.473 --> 16:52.942
You're good at this.

16:52.944 --> 16:55.177
Some people choose to
work at Yogurt City, Tom.

16:55.179 --> 16:56.544
I choose not to.

16:56.546 --> 16:58.214
It's kind of a big
difference, though.

16:58.216 --> 17:01.683
Oh, what got you into... I mean,
like, how did you decide...?

17:01.685 --> 17:03.484
There are 2,000 students
at our school,

17:03.486 --> 17:05.720
which translates to, uh,
4,000 parents,

17:05.722 --> 17:06.654
give or take a few.

17:06.656 --> 17:08.556
Statistically,
there will always be

17:08.558 --> 17:10.391
a few unredeemable
shitheads in there.

17:10.393 --> 17:11.726
So you're just, um...

17:11.728 --> 17:13.797
Trying to make the
world a better place.

17:14.798 --> 17:16.332
Right!

17:16.334 --> 17:18.236
Way better.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.339
Wow, you could
really be screwed.

17:25.342 --> 17:26.741
Of course, there's
always junior college.

17:26.742 --> 17:28.407
I don't want
junior college.

17:28.410 --> 17:30.377
I want UCSB and now
I've got Heather's

17:30.379 --> 17:33.514
fake-ass D-cups
standing in my way.

17:33.516 --> 17:35.750
I guess I'll just have
to figure something out.

17:35.752 --> 17:37.286
Mm-hmm.

17:37.288 --> 17:38.555
Mmm, it's good.

17:40.291 --> 17:41.689
And cue the
male camel-toe.

17:41.691 --> 17:43.625
Bite me, alkie.
Time to get our cheer on.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.460
Shouldn't you be, like,
in mourning or something?

17:45.462 --> 17:47.527
Mm, life's for the living.

17:47.529 --> 17:49.197
Plus, I like to think my
parents are watching from above,

17:49.199 --> 17:50.664
because that's
my better angle.

17:50.666 --> 17:52.367
And I'm sure they're
still quite ashamed.

17:52.369 --> 17:53.868
Thanks for the sympathy.
Now let's get our cheer on.

17:53.870 --> 17:55.203
Team won't win without us.

17:55.205 --> 17:56.940
Yeah, and they're not
gonna win with us either.

18:02.445 --> 18:05.446
Okay, come on, Kenny!
Take it to the hole!

18:05.448 --> 18:07.715
Kenny, use that
lazy-ass to block out.

18:07.717 --> 18:10.084
Can't you try to
be supportive?

18:10.086 --> 18:12.320
What, he's too sensitive
for a little criticism?

18:12.322 --> 18:14.122
He's doing his best.

18:14.124 --> 18:15.422
Come on.

18:15.424 --> 18:17.791
Kenny, you had a man
open in the paint.

18:17.793 --> 18:19.726
All that kid wants to do
is shoot threes.

18:19.728 --> 18:21.428
He doesn't want to pass.
He doesn't want to block out.

18:21.430 --> 18:23.031
He's watching this
game tape tonight

18:23.033 --> 18:24.065
whether he wants to or not.

18:37.414 --> 18:39.012
Yeah, all right.
All right.

18:39.014 --> 18:40.248
Girls look cute.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.882
Makes me wanna get out there
and shake it.

18:41.884 --> 18:43.251
Yeah, at least somebody
in this gym

18:43.253 --> 18:44.687
knows what
the hell they're doing.

18:45.721 --> 18:46.988
Okay, Cliff!

18:46.990 --> 18:48.855
- I'm gonna show this to Kenny.
- Yeah, I...

18:48.857 --> 18:50.524
Show him what talent
and practice does.

18:50.526 --> 18:52.260
Yeah, well, this is
the only thing

18:52.262 --> 18:53.830
you've actually focused on.

18:57.067 --> 18:59.467
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah, girls.

19:09.279 --> 19:11.145
Basketball?
Seriously?

19:12.282 --> 19:13.613
Just watch the game, Sydney.

19:13.615 --> 19:16.419
Follow the ball
and cheer when I do.

19:24.525 --> 19:26.326
So, tell me about
your parents.

19:26.328 --> 19:28.697
Hobbies, activities, clubs.

19:30.399 --> 19:31.834
Three-pointer! Yes!

19:33.135 --> 19:34.435
Activities.

19:34.437 --> 19:35.502
You mean like their
all-encompassing,

19:35.504 --> 19:36.803
back-to-nature
lifestyle?

19:36.805 --> 19:39.407
Well, maybe.
Tell me about it.

19:39.409 --> 19:41.875
It's making my life unlivable.

19:41.877 --> 19:44.011
Dinner's ready!

19:44.013 --> 19:45.980
Who's up
for vegan tacos?

19:45.982 --> 19:48.215
Oh, my God, you guys
are so disgusting!

19:48.217 --> 19:49.582
Relax, Syd,

19:49.584 --> 19:51.351
the human body is
a beautiful thing.

19:51.353 --> 19:52.352
Mm-hmm.

19:52.354 --> 19:53.719
No, no, it's not.

19:53.721 --> 19:55.389
What's wrong, honey,
aren't you hungry?

19:55.391 --> 19:58.425
No. And I'm pretty sure
I'll never be hungry again.

19:58.427 --> 20:00.827
That's it?

20:00.829 --> 20:02.631
You asked for an example.

20:03.932 --> 20:06.401
I'm sorry, Sydney,
that your parents are hippies,

20:06.403 --> 20:07.968
but if that's your
only complaint, I...

20:07.970 --> 20:11.670
Oh, trust me, that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

20:11.672 --> 20:14.573
This is Gary Vaughn and...

20:14.575 --> 20:16.143
Betty Vaughn.

20:16.145 --> 20:19.745
You are listening
to <i>Nature Matters.</i>

20:19.747 --> 20:21.982
Northern California's
leading podcast

20:21.984 --> 20:23.150
about foraging

20:23.152 --> 20:26.686
and things that are
important to foragers.

20:26.688 --> 20:28.455
Yes, Gary, and this week
I thought it would be fun

20:28.457 --> 20:30.390
to give a few tips
to those beginners out there

20:30.392 --> 20:31.792
who might be interested
in sourcing

20:31.794 --> 20:34.227
their own food in the wild.

20:34.229 --> 20:35.728
That does sound like fun.

20:35.730 --> 20:37.163
<i>Again,
I don't see the big deal.</i>

20:37.165 --> 20:39.165
<i>Shut up.
I'm getting there.</i>

20:39.167 --> 20:42.068
<i>So their last book sold,
like, a billion copies, right?</i>

20:42.070 --> 20:44.404
<i>And what did those
hypocrites spend it on?</i>

20:44.406 --> 20:46.006
<i>Private air travel,</i>

20:46.008 --> 20:47.974

21:09.097 --> 21:10.297
<i>or nuclear winter.</i>

21:10.299 --> 21:11.632
<i>It's my parents.</i>

21:12.568 --> 21:16.303
Okay. I got it.

21:16.305 --> 21:18.138
You're familiar with
my terms, right?

21:18.140 --> 21:19.306
Anything.

21:19.308 --> 21:20.974
I just want it
over with.

21:20.976 --> 21:24.810
Okay. I'm on it.

21:24.812 --> 21:27.715
Now sit back, relax,
and enjoy the game.

21:32.286 --> 21:33.319
Yeah!

21:53.640 --> 21:56.275
Staring off into
the distance again?

21:57.778 --> 22:00.379
Did I ever tell you

22:00.381 --> 22:04.183
how sexy you look
doing that?

22:04.185 --> 22:05.554
Jeanette...

22:07.456 --> 22:08.455
Wait.

22:08.457 --> 22:09.824
What?

22:10.724 --> 22:12.092
You started smoking again.

22:12.926 --> 22:14.260
I had one little cigarette.

22:14.262 --> 22:16.462
Well, one little cigarette,
or the whole pack,

22:16.464 --> 22:17.662
it's still
the same stink.

22:17.664 --> 22:21.100
Yeah, okay, I get it.
I smoked.

22:21.102 --> 22:23.402
Sorry for polluting
your little delicate,

22:23.404 --> 22:25.740
little smoke-free mouth.

22:28.376 --> 22:31.645
So, do you want to tell me
what you're thinking about?

22:31.647 --> 22:33.979
This boy in Kenny's class.

22:33.981 --> 22:35.813
So, while I'm trying
to have sex with you,

22:35.815 --> 22:38.417
you're thinking about
a boy in Kenny's class?

22:38.419 --> 22:39.552
No.

22:39.554 --> 22:40.818
His name is Reagan Collins,

22:40.820 --> 22:42.987
and he knew all the kids
whose parents died.

22:42.989 --> 22:44.490
Yeah, it's a small town,
Cliff.

22:44.492 --> 22:45.823
A lot of people did.

22:45.825 --> 22:47.059
I don't know.
This kid's weird.

22:47.061 --> 22:49.128
He doesn't even have
a cell phone.

22:49.130 --> 22:51.297
Lock him up, he doesn't
have a cell phone.

22:51.299 --> 22:53.065
Well,
he's 17 years old.

22:53.067 --> 22:56.001
Even that little handicap girl
who graduated last year,

22:56.003 --> 22:58.103
she had a cell phone and
she doesn't have any arms.

22:58.105 --> 22:59.470
Cliff.

22:59.472 --> 23:01.940
I don't know, the kid just
pings my radar, that's all.

23:01.942 --> 23:05.611
Okay, Cliff, listen to me.

23:05.613 --> 23:06.811
You are a good cop,

23:06.813 --> 23:09.881
but you don't
have to try so hard.

23:09.883 --> 23:11.684
You had your moment
in the sun

23:11.686 --> 23:13.017
with the Adderall bust.

23:13.019 --> 23:15.254
Accolades, your picture
in the paper.

23:15.256 --> 23:18.691
Not every case
has to be a home run.

23:18.693 --> 23:20.226
Yeah, you're right.

23:21.761 --> 23:23.230
That was some bust,
though, wasn't it?

23:25.198 --> 23:27.901
I cut bangs, you
didn't even notice.

23:29.002 --> 23:30.570
Mm.

23:46.653 --> 23:48.720
Hey, pal.
What's up?

23:48.722 --> 23:51.091
I'm just working
on a paper.

23:52.092 --> 23:53.124
English?

23:53.126 --> 23:54.626
No, biology.

23:54.628 --> 23:55.927
Fungus.

23:55.929 --> 23:57.696
Oh.

23:57.698 --> 23:59.797
Well, I'm sure you'll find a way
to make that interesting, too.

23:59.799 --> 24:01.766
Oh, I'm trying my best.

24:01.768 --> 24:03.201
You always do.

24:04.337 --> 24:05.640
Proud of you, son.

24:07.274 --> 24:08.376
I know.

24:09.776 --> 24:12.543
In this map it's telling us it's
only four minutes to reach this hill.

24:12.545 --> 24:14.579
- No, just... can you trust it?
- It's... Yes, that's the point.

24:14.581 --> 24:15.580
It's... but, we're
at Dixie Canyon...

24:15.582 --> 24:16.947
Have fun foraging.

24:16.949 --> 24:18.285
Bye-bye.

25:18.911 --> 25:20.244
- Hey.
- <i>Dad, what-</i>

25:20.246 --> 25:21.681
Hey. What's so funny?

25:23.215 --> 25:24.648
<i>Get out of here,
Tommy, you soft little bitch.</i>

25:24.650 --> 25:25.882
<i>You're being stupid
right now!</i>

25:25.884 --> 25:27.417
<i>Get outta here!
Who wants to fuck?</i>

25:27.419 --> 25:30.354
- <i>Right now, who wants to fuck?</i>
- Are you serious?

25:30.356 --> 25:31.922
Come on, the man's dead.

25:31.924 --> 25:34.191
Show some respect.

25:34.193 --> 25:35.992
Break it up.
Come on now.

25:41.668 --> 25:43.334
<i>Tragedy has once again struck</i>

25:43.336 --> 25:45.536
<i>the community
of Washington Heights.</i>

25:45.538 --> 25:48.538
<i>Two well-know foraging experts,
Gary and Betty Vaughn,</i>

25:48.540 --> 25:50.906
<i>were found dead
inside their home today.</i>

25:50.908 --> 25:52.442
- Hey! Turn that up.
- <i>Authorities believe</i>

25:52.444 --> 25:54.344
<i>it may have been a case
of accidental poisoning.</i>

25:54.346 --> 25:57.881
<i>This...
is a death cap mushroom.</i>

25:57.883 --> 26:00.083
<i>It looks edible, but it's not.</i>

26:00.085 --> 26:02.185
<i>Here comes their daughter now.</i>

26:02.187 --> 26:03.420
<i>Sydney!</i>

26:03.422 --> 26:05.088
<i>Sydney, are you
surprised your parents</i>

26:05.090 --> 26:07.357
<i>made such a careless
and deadly mistake?</i>

26:07.359 --> 26:11.062
<i>Oh, I don't know.
Why don't you suck my dick?</i>

26:13.197 --> 26:14.999
<i>Here come the bodies now.</i>

26:19.138 --> 26:21.273
<i>I just wanna
help out any way I can.</i>

26:23.642 --> 26:25.242
Shit.

26:25.244 --> 26:26.878
A B-plus?

26:26.880 --> 26:29.814
You missed one.
It happens.

26:29.816 --> 26:32.048
Whoops. Time for
a nervous breakdown.

26:32.050 --> 26:35.752
Just to ease your mind,
you still have an A in class.

26:35.754 --> 26:37.888
No. This should be an A.

26:37.890 --> 26:39.825
You made a mistake.

26:41.225 --> 26:43.429
I'm happy to discuss it
after class.

26:56.008 --> 26:59.743
Once we add the solid
to the liquid,

26:59.745 --> 27:01.045
we'll see combustion.

27:08.754 --> 27:09.920
And it's green.

27:09.922 --> 27:11.287
No chemical traces.

27:11.289 --> 27:14.658
Well, that is some
advanced chemistry.

27:14.660 --> 27:16.259
Well beyond this class.

27:16.261 --> 27:19.064
All right,
I'll change it to an A.

27:20.799 --> 27:22.299
A-plus.

27:22.301 --> 27:23.499
Thank you.

27:23.501 --> 27:25.869
So that's how you
get such good grades.

27:25.871 --> 27:29.940
Just pointing out
a mistake.

27:29.942 --> 27:31.440
Can I help you
with something?

27:31.442 --> 27:33.610
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
you could walk me home.

27:33.612 --> 27:37.483
- Oh, I... I would, but...
- Fine. I'll walk you.

27:41.386 --> 27:42.719
You're different
than people think.

27:42.721 --> 27:44.186
I am?

27:44.188 --> 27:48.224
Yeah, well you seem like
Reagan Collins, Mr. Serious Guy

27:48.226 --> 27:50.226
all about science
and studying

27:50.228 --> 27:52.396
and making the world
a better place.

27:53.831 --> 27:55.397
But you think
I'm not like that.

27:55.399 --> 27:57.299
Oh, you are.
Definitely.

27:57.301 --> 28:00.503
But, I think there's another
side to you that's fun.

28:01.506 --> 28:02.806
Maybe a little twisted,
but fun.

28:02.808 --> 28:05.007
Twisted, but fun, huh?

28:05.009 --> 28:06.008
Are you denying it?

28:06.010 --> 28:07.844
No, not necessarily.

28:07.846 --> 28:10.246
Uh, this is... me.

28:10.248 --> 28:11.480
I'd invite you
inside, but I...

28:11.482 --> 28:13.248
I do have a lot
of homework to do.

28:13.250 --> 28:14.950
Yeah... yeah,
I should get home.

28:14.952 --> 28:16.652
I can't wait to see
what Food Network recipe

28:16.654 --> 28:17.853
Heather's butchered this time.

28:17.855 --> 28:18.921
Oh, Heather?

28:18.923 --> 28:20.422
She's my step-mom.

28:20.424 --> 28:22.625
She's this big-breasted,
dumb-ass slut

28:22.627 --> 28:25.194
who bosses me around while
spending my college money.

28:25.196 --> 28:26.662
Sounds like a pretty
common dynamic.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.364
Your parents divorced, too?

28:28.366 --> 28:29.933
No, uh, happily married,
actually.

28:29.935 --> 28:31.534
Twenty years.

28:31.536 --> 28:33.837
But, if you're wondering
how to deal with Heather,

28:33.839 --> 28:35.036
there are ways.

28:35.038 --> 28:36.939
Oh, you mean besides
murdering her.

28:36.941 --> 28:39.475
Yeah.
Just agree with her.

28:39.477 --> 28:41.242
Always.

28:41.244 --> 28:42.711
And I mean everything.

28:42.713 --> 28:43.979
You're kidding.

28:43.981 --> 28:45.347
No. No, no, no.

28:45.349 --> 28:48.384
She'll love it.
Your dad will love it.

28:48.386 --> 28:50.052
And you just do
whatever you want.

28:50.054 --> 28:51.622
Everybody wins.

28:52.657 --> 28:54.425
Okay. I'll try it.

28:58.695 --> 29:01.298
Look at that,
I'm happy already.

29:02.432 --> 29:04.067
Thanks for letting me
walk you home.

29:30.061 --> 29:32.594
Hey, Reagan.
Got a minute?

29:32.596 --> 29:34.228
Detective Dawkins.

29:34.230 --> 29:35.564
Can I help you
with something?

29:35.566 --> 29:36.932
Yeah.

29:36.934 --> 29:38.834
Just wondering if I could
ask you a couple questions.

29:38.836 --> 29:41.336
Yeah, sure.
Do you wanna come in?

29:41.338 --> 29:43.307
Yeah. Great.
It'll only take a moment.

29:45.076 --> 29:47.709
Um, my parents
aren't home yet.

29:47.711 --> 29:49.010
Is everything all right?

29:49.012 --> 29:50.244
Did something happen to them?

29:50.246 --> 29:53.414
What? Oh, no.
Of course, they're fine.

29:53.416 --> 29:54.749
- They're fine.
- Okay.

29:54.751 --> 29:57.086
No, I was just hoping to ask you
some questions about Sydney Vaughn.

29:57.088 --> 29:58.720
Oh, okay.

29:58.722 --> 30:01.255
I'll use the restroom real quick
and... Can I get you anything?

30:01.257 --> 30:03.694
No, I'm fine.
Thank you.

30:31.889 --> 30:33.989
So you were asking
about Sydney.

30:33.991 --> 30:36.660
It's so sad about
her... parents.

30:38.862 --> 30:41.328
Yeah, terrible accident.

30:41.330 --> 30:42.666
Terrible accident.

30:46.002 --> 30:47.368
I saw you two
sitting together

30:47.370 --> 30:49.005
at the Mission High
game the other night.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.441
Yeah. So?

30:53.144 --> 30:55.044
So, I just thought I'd
ask you a few questions

30:55.046 --> 30:56.078
about your relationship.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.645
Uh, uh, our relationship?

30:57.647 --> 30:59.413
Well, I would have assumed
that you two were dating

30:59.415 --> 31:01.450
until I saw you kissing
that pretty redhead.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.253
I... I'm...
I'm sorry, Detective,

31:06.255 --> 31:08.156
wh... what is this about again?

31:08.158 --> 31:11.258
Sydney is just a girl that
I know from school, so...

31:11.260 --> 31:13.394
Well, why don't you tell me
a little bit more about her.

31:13.396 --> 31:15.197
She tell you about her
relationship with her parents?

31:16.266 --> 31:18.167
She must be going
through a lot right now.

31:18.169 --> 31:19.867
What is it that you
two talk about?

31:19.869 --> 31:21.369
Actually, I can't
talk about that.

31:21.371 --> 31:23.372
Son, you are aware this
is a police investigation?

31:24.473 --> 31:25.741
Even so.

31:30.512 --> 31:32.814
Well, let me put it
to you like this,

31:32.816 --> 31:34.281
either you can tell me here

31:34.283 --> 31:36.218
or you can tell me
at the station.

31:37.187 --> 31:38.722
I'll grab a sweatshirt.

31:43.126 --> 31:45.660
Oh, Jesus.

31:45.662 --> 31:47.227
You should've brought
me in on this, Cliff.

31:47.229 --> 31:49.029
I would've told you
this is a terrible idea.

31:49.031 --> 31:51.031
Did you hear a single word
that I said?

31:51.033 --> 31:52.399
You brought a minor in here

31:52.401 --> 31:53.934
and didn't tell his parents
or charge him?

31:53.936 --> 31:54.969
Are you insane?

31:54.971 --> 31:56.369
He's killing people, Ronnie.

31:56.371 --> 31:57.537
Do you remember
the Adderall bust?

31:57.539 --> 31:59.040
You never let anyone
forget it.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.074
Everybody thought I was wrong.

32:00.076 --> 32:01.075
Was I wrong?

32:01.077 --> 32:02.143
You were not.

32:02.145 --> 32:03.678
Exactly. I was right.

32:03.680 --> 32:07.148
What is wrong with just
doing your job, Cliff?

32:07.150 --> 32:09.050
This is a bedroom
community.

32:09.052 --> 32:10.984
Traffic tickets,
jaywalking,

32:10.986 --> 32:12.452
the occasional
break and enter.

32:12.454 --> 32:15.756
We do not get psycho
teenage serial killers here.

32:15.758 --> 32:16.923
So, it's true.

32:16.925 --> 32:19.893
Why is Reagan Collins
in my interrogation room?

32:19.895 --> 32:21.463
Hey!

32:24.067 --> 32:25.532
I brought him in.

32:25.534 --> 32:27.935
He's connected to all
those kids whose parents died.

32:27.937 --> 32:29.139
Connected how?

32:31.640 --> 32:32.674
He's responsible.

32:34.243 --> 32:35.876
Are you out of
your mind, Cliff?

32:35.878 --> 32:37.811
Jane, people are dropping
dead all over this town

32:37.813 --> 32:39.780
and this kid is the only
common denominator.

32:39.782 --> 32:42.149
The reports you wrote
said "accident".

32:42.151 --> 32:43.784
And now I'm telling you
they weren't.

32:43.786 --> 32:45.285
There is a pattern.

32:45.287 --> 32:47.621
Reagan Collins was the last kid
at the Mulnick party,

32:47.623 --> 32:49.790
he was running
the Wallace fundraiser,

32:49.792 --> 32:53.493
and he was with Sydney Vaughn
right before her parents died.

32:53.495 --> 32:54.895
When questioned,
he was evasive,

32:54.897 --> 32:58.031
and I found an encyclopedia
opened to the entry "M",

32:58.033 --> 32:59.232
and I am tell...

32:59.234 --> 33:00.666
Oh, God, would you
just shut up?

33:00.668 --> 33:03.435
That kid was in
my husband's scout troop.

33:03.437 --> 33:05.240
His mother is
my dermatologist.

33:06.642 --> 33:07.941
It's a con.

33:07.943 --> 33:09.441
He is lying to you,

33:09.443 --> 33:11.343
and I wanna know what
you're gonna do about it.

33:32.167 --> 33:33.934
Fuck.

33:33.936 --> 33:37.838
Yeah, I'm glad he
didn't break his oath, too.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.306
Thanks, Miss Peterson.

33:39.308 --> 33:41.375
Again, sorry to bother
you at home.

33:42.845 --> 33:43.879
Good night.

33:48.616 --> 33:50.115
You realize if
Reagan's parents decide

33:50.117 --> 33:54.321
to file a complaint,
your ass is toast, right?

33:54.323 --> 33:56.022
The Vaughn girl
was assigned to him.

33:56.024 --> 33:57.456
Assigned?

33:57.458 --> 33:59.725
Yeah, he's a peer counselor,
you jackass.

33:59.727 --> 34:03.129
Confidentiality
is part of the program.

34:03.131 --> 34:05.364
He was keeping his promise,
not killing her parents.

34:05.366 --> 34:06.900
- Jane...
- What is wrong with you?

34:06.902 --> 34:09.235
Do you realize that
we're here to solve crimes

34:09.237 --> 34:10.569
- and not invent them?
- And I...

34:10.571 --> 34:11.971
And if you bring up
that Adderall case

34:11.973 --> 34:13.739
one more time,
you will be the next one dead,

34:13.741 --> 34:16.577
because I will shoot you
in the face.

34:19.214 --> 34:21.214
I'm done with your
wild goose chases.

34:21.216 --> 34:23.252
- This goose is real.
- Get out, Cliff.

34:24.851 --> 34:26.353
And, Cliff,

34:26.355 --> 34:28.556
take the boy home.

34:34.728 --> 34:35.895
I hope it helps.

34:35.897 --> 34:38.799
Thanks for the donation.
Sydney can really use it.

35:03.024 --> 35:06.859
That must have been pretty
embarrassing back there.

35:06.861 --> 35:10.863
Hey, if you're wondering
if I'm mad, I'm not.

35:10.865 --> 35:13.999
Honestly, you're just
trying to do your job.

35:14.001 --> 35:15.801
Frankly, I think
it's a bit unprofessional

35:15.803 --> 35:18.039
the way your co-workers make
fun of you behind your back.

35:20.574 --> 35:23.510
Anyway, thanks for the ride.

35:26.780 --> 35:28.049
Okay, then.

35:42.964 --> 35:44.332
No hard feelings?

35:49.903 --> 35:51.339
All righty.

35:56.676 --> 35:57.811
Wuss.

36:06.220 --> 36:07.822
We ate without you.

36:09.522 --> 36:10.989
I was gonna reheat
some pot roast,

36:10.991 --> 36:15.560
but I see you brought
your own meal.

36:15.562 --> 36:16.894
That's a generous pour.

36:16.896 --> 36:18.529
Would you like some ice
with that or...

36:18.531 --> 36:21.001
Oh, apparently not.

36:22.068 --> 36:23.469
Wow.

36:23.471 --> 36:28.140
Looks like about,
uh, 25,000 calories there.

36:28.142 --> 36:30.510
You trying to put back on
all the weight you lost?

36:33.247 --> 36:35.313
Kenny's outside with James.

36:35.315 --> 36:37.348
Trying to dunk.

36:37.350 --> 36:39.183
They're getting
closer every day.

36:39.185 --> 36:41.052
He should be studying.

36:41.054 --> 36:42.653
If he fails out of class,

36:42.655 --> 36:44.423
they're gonna kick him
off the team.

36:44.425 --> 36:47.859
Really? That's it?

36:47.861 --> 36:49.261
That's all you have to say?

36:49.263 --> 36:50.697
I don't wanna talk about it.

36:52.665 --> 36:54.199
Where are you going?

36:54.201 --> 36:56.534
Outside.

36:56.536 --> 36:58.036
Don't wanna
miss this dunk.

36:58.038 --> 37:00.874
Yeah. Mr. Fun Drumstick.

37:02.409 --> 37:04.342
Aw, come on, man.

37:04.344 --> 37:05.712
Oh, hey.
Good take, Kenny.

37:07.113 --> 37:08.279
No, don't stop.
Don't stop.

37:08.281 --> 37:09.714
No, keep going.

37:09.716 --> 37:11.382
Actually, give me the ball.
Let me play, too.

37:11.384 --> 37:13.618
- Dad, come on.
- Seriously?

37:13.620 --> 37:15.153
- What?
- Just give him the ball, man.

37:15.155 --> 37:16.854
Let's go.
There we go.

37:16.856 --> 37:18.825
Show you boys how it's done.

37:21.994 --> 37:23.560
Wow.

37:23.562 --> 37:24.628
You know, I think you'd get
a little better arc there

37:24.630 --> 37:25.929
if you got rid
of the drumstick.

37:25.931 --> 37:27.465
Very funny.
You guys wanna play HORSE?

37:27.467 --> 37:28.935
How 'bout some PIG?

37:30.203 --> 37:31.635
There he is.

37:31.637 --> 37:33.637
My son, the comedian,
ladies and gentlemen.

37:33.639 --> 37:35.909
The comedian who
can almost dunk.

37:39.779 --> 37:41.479
Ah.

37:41.481 --> 37:42.713
Well, that's a P.

37:42.715 --> 37:44.485
All right, got you
right where I want you.

37:47.886 --> 37:50.388
Hey, you guys, uh,
you know a kid

37:50.390 --> 37:51.922
at your school
named Reagan Collins?

37:51.924 --> 37:52.925
Who?

37:54.461 --> 37:55.592
Oh, you know him.

37:55.594 --> 37:57.428
He was over at
the Mulnick party.

37:57.430 --> 37:59.596
Pale, delicate,
preppy-looking kid?

37:59.598 --> 38:01.798
Oh, yeah, that guy.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.767
Yeah, I think he's
in my chemistry class.

38:03.769 --> 38:05.570
- Yeah?
- All right, what are we doing?

38:05.572 --> 38:06.904
Are we gonna play
basketball or what?

38:06.906 --> 38:08.739
Just making conversation.
You ever talk to him?

38:08.741 --> 38:10.807
No. I mean, not really.

38:10.809 --> 38:12.843
He's one of those guys
that only talks to adults.

38:12.845 --> 38:14.579
Kinda sounds like one, too.

38:14.581 --> 38:16.179
Dad, why are you asking
us this stuff...

38:16.181 --> 38:17.582
It's a work thing, Kenny.

38:17.584 --> 38:20.016
Okay, well, no one we
know hangs out with him.

38:20.018 --> 38:22.455
So, can you shoot the ball?
It's your turn.

38:24.890 --> 38:25.991
No. Game's over.

38:28.995 --> 38:30.528
Dad. Ball.

38:30.530 --> 38:31.963
No. No more ball.

38:31.965 --> 38:34.464
James, go home.
Kenny, get inside.

38:34.466 --> 38:35.801
Hit the books.

38:37.669 --> 38:39.669
Dude, don't take this
the wrong way,

38:39.671 --> 38:41.574
but your dad's a dick.

38:44.209 --> 38:45.642
You look like hell.

38:45.644 --> 38:47.244
I just need
a little coffee.

38:47.246 --> 38:48.513
Did you look in the mirror?

38:48.515 --> 38:49.880
It's gonna take
a lot more than coffee.

38:49.882 --> 38:52.617
Hey.
I need you to help me

38:52.619 --> 38:54.519
get Reagan Collins'
Internet activity.

38:54.521 --> 38:56.052
There is no way
I'm doing that.

38:56.054 --> 38:57.522
Come on.

38:57.524 --> 38:59.055
The kid's out there making us
look like fucking idiots.

38:59.057 --> 39:00.789
He's not making me
look like an idiot.

39:00.791 --> 39:02.893
Look, if that disrespectful
little shit is out there

39:02.895 --> 39:04.794
killing people and you
don't do anything about it,

39:04.796 --> 39:06.363
then that's on you.

39:06.365 --> 39:08.064
All right.
I will see what I can do.

39:08.066 --> 39:09.266
Good, because
I'm gonna need some help

39:09.268 --> 39:10.433
with surveillance, too.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.070
I don't even wanna
hear about that.

39:24.550 --> 39:26.249
Reagan, wait.

39:26.251 --> 39:27.950
Come on.

39:27.952 --> 39:29.919
Come on, Reagan,
I can't run that fast.

39:29.921 --> 39:33.089
I've got degenerative bursitis
and I'm pretty out of shape.

39:33.091 --> 39:33.924
Do I know you?

39:33.926 --> 39:36.259
Hey, man.
Grant Hall?

39:36.261 --> 39:37.827
Okay, so?

39:37.829 --> 39:39.664
So, can you slow down
a minute?

39:39.666 --> 39:41.731
Coach is watching.

39:41.733 --> 39:43.266
Nice chatting
with you, though.

39:43.268 --> 39:44.602
Wh... ah...
I love ice cream!

39:44.604 --> 39:47.002
What flavor?

39:47.004 --> 39:49.705
Uh, uh, rum r... uh,
butter pecan. Butter pecan!

39:49.707 --> 39:51.675
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

39:51.677 --> 39:52.775
Wait, that's it?

39:52.777 --> 39:54.078
I said I would talk
to you later.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.092
<i>What, are you
spying on me now?</i>

40:10.094 --> 40:11.794
<i>As if.</i>

40:11.796 --> 40:13.597
<i>Okay,
what's this about?</i>

40:13.599 --> 40:15.898
We need to talk.

40:15.900 --> 40:18.236
- Okay.
- Not here.

40:24.343 --> 40:26.744
All right, smile, asshole.

40:38.189 --> 40:39.822
You recorded him?

40:39.824 --> 40:41.591
I got a lead.

40:43.361 --> 40:45.629
No, shit. Okay.

40:45.631 --> 40:47.430
No, it's just...

40:47.432 --> 40:48.998
<i>What, are you
spying on me now?</i>

40:49.000 --> 40:51.635
<i>We need to talk.
Not here.</i>

40:51.637 --> 40:53.370
<i>Okay, what's this about?</i>

40:53.372 --> 40:55.773
<i>I need you to do
something for me.</i>

40:57.276 --> 40:59.941
That sounds like
a murder solicitation.

40:59.943 --> 41:01.809
Or she wants help
with her algebra.

41:01.811 --> 41:03.078
Who is she?

41:03.080 --> 41:04.446
I don't know.
Some cheerleader.

41:04.448 --> 41:05.848
I don't know
her name yet.

41:05.850 --> 41:07.082
Jesus, she's hot.

41:07.084 --> 41:09.721
Come on,
don't be a pervert.

41:24.735 --> 41:26.836
Mary Alice Walker.

41:41.720 --> 41:43.321
Can we please go now?

41:44.855 --> 41:46.954
Uh, kind of in
the middle of something.

41:46.956 --> 41:49.425
I need to get out of here.

41:49.427 --> 41:50.726
In a little while.

41:50.728 --> 41:52.126
Have a beer. Relax.

41:52.128 --> 41:54.496
I've had three
and it's not helping.

41:54.498 --> 41:56.099
Try four.

41:57.535 --> 41:59.836
Beer number four it is then.

42:07.244 --> 42:08.279
Get me a beer.

42:10.815 --> 42:12.280
Well, she took the last beer.

42:12.282 --> 42:13.981
Yo, Grant!

42:13.983 --> 42:15.083
Grant, where you at?

42:15.085 --> 42:16.851
Jesus!
I was taking a piss.

42:16.853 --> 42:18.754
Hey, I got some more
beer in my car.

42:18.756 --> 42:19.956
Go get it for me.

42:23.494 --> 42:24.795
Hurry up.

42:31.135 --> 42:33.867
"There's beer in my car.
Go get it."

42:33.869 --> 42:35.703
What am I, a servant?

42:35.705 --> 42:37.672
Stupid.

42:37.674 --> 42:39.042
Told you I'd see ya.

42:40.477 --> 42:43.478
Okay, so let me make sure
I got this straight.

42:43.480 --> 42:46.615
Your mom has custody
of you and your sister

42:46.617 --> 42:48.216
and there's a boyfriend.

42:48.218 --> 42:49.418
Yeah, Hector.

42:49.420 --> 42:52.388
That goddamn ball-bag is
all my mom cares about.

42:52.390 --> 42:55.324
Hector. Hector. Hector.

42:55.326 --> 42:58.159
So, you're saying
his name is... Hector.

42:58.161 --> 42:59.861
Total prick.

42:59.863 --> 43:01.062
You know, I looked
some stuff up online.

43:01.064 --> 43:02.797
He's married, for one.

43:02.799 --> 43:04.732
And he's been arrested
three times,

43:04.734 --> 43:06.200
and the last time
was for stealing

43:06.202 --> 43:08.903
from little old ladies
at the retirement center

43:08.905 --> 43:10.304
where he worked.

43:10.306 --> 43:11.339
That's pretty low.

43:11.341 --> 43:13.441
No, it gets worse.

43:13.443 --> 43:17.414
He was seducing them and
then stealing their money.

43:20.551 --> 43:21.816
Does your mom
know about this?

43:21.818 --> 43:23.984
Are you kidding?
I heard them talking.

43:23.986 --> 43:25.453
It was her idea.

43:25.455 --> 43:28.890
W... I... I mean,
not like the love-making.

43:28.892 --> 43:30.425
That was Hector.

43:30.427 --> 43:32.960
He also wears like
a crap-ton of man jewelry,

43:32.962 --> 43:34.929
which I understand, you know,
is a personal choice,

43:34.931 --> 43:35.930
but, like, it doesn't stop...

43:35.932 --> 43:37.800
Wait, why don't you just
go live with your dad?

43:37.802 --> 43:39.167
Oh, we can't.

43:39.169 --> 43:41.904
Mom told the court a bunch
of lies to get custody.

43:41.906 --> 43:43.371
If it was just me,
it'd be okay.

43:43.373 --> 43:47.274
You know, another year
and I'm gone, but...

43:47.276 --> 43:48.545
I've got
a little sister, man.

43:49.978 --> 43:51.945
You should see the way
mom yells at her.

43:51.947 --> 43:54.116
- Mom, look what I found...
- Not now!

43:56.985 --> 44:00.288
Oh, did I mention they like
to do it in Hector's car?

44:01.558 --> 44:03.090
- Oh, yes, Hector.
- Right outside on the street.

44:03.092 --> 44:04.425
The whole neighborhood knows.

44:04.427 --> 44:05.827
Oh, Hector, oh.

44:05.829 --> 44:09.096
Last week, I came home and
found my sister watching them.

44:09.098 --> 44:11.666
Hector. Hector, oh!

44:11.668 --> 44:13.868
She's seven, man.

44:13.870 --> 44:15.170
What would you do?

44:16.806 --> 44:19.007
Well, that's not for me
to decide, Grant.

44:20.410 --> 44:22.175
But the good news is,

44:22.177 --> 44:24.812
these problems you're
having, they're solvable.

44:24.814 --> 44:28.616
- You think so?
- I know so.

44:28.618 --> 44:31.786
But there are a couple questions
you have to ask yourself first.

44:31.788 --> 44:34.988
One, do you
and your sister

44:34.990 --> 44:36.858
deserve to be humiliated
and neglected anymore?

44:36.860 --> 44:38.291
Hell, no.

44:38.293 --> 44:42.395
Two, would you be
better off with your dad?

44:42.397 --> 44:44.998
Would your sister
be better off?

44:45.000 --> 44:48.970
Yes. And yes.

44:48.972 --> 44:50.805
Okay, let's do it.

44:50.807 --> 44:52.974
Oh, one thing, though,
I don't...

44:52.976 --> 44:54.809
exactly have a lot of...

44:54.811 --> 44:56.513
money.

44:58.180 --> 44:59.181
Not yet.

45:09.591 --> 45:10.960
Need some help?

45:14.029 --> 45:16.463
What are you doing here?

45:16.465 --> 45:17.765
Oh, you know,
it's my hobby,

45:17.767 --> 45:18.933
just wandering
through the park

45:18.935 --> 45:21.034
looking for
drunk cheerleaders

45:21.036 --> 45:22.636
so I can steal
their keys.

45:22.638 --> 45:24.538
Drunk?

45:24.540 --> 45:26.542
I've had, like, two beers.

45:28.443 --> 45:29.476
Okay, four.

45:29.478 --> 45:31.046
Keys.

45:33.950 --> 45:36.716
Wow, you really are
quite the Boy Scout.

45:36.718 --> 45:38.552
I'm okay.

45:38.554 --> 45:39.854
Don't be modest.

45:39.856 --> 45:41.421
You could have just
saved my life.

45:41.423 --> 45:45.357
What can I possibly
do to thank you?

45:45.359 --> 45:46.458
It's okay, really.
Really.

45:46.460 --> 45:47.961
Come on,
there must be something.

45:47.963 --> 45:49.729
No.

45:49.731 --> 45:52.465
No?

45:52.467 --> 45:53.967
It's late.

45:53.969 --> 45:55.671
Come on, you've
been drinking.

45:57.239 --> 46:00.040
So, you're saying
if I hadn't had two...

46:00.042 --> 46:01.541
Four.

46:01.543 --> 46:05.414
Four beers, this could've
taken a different turn?

46:09.550 --> 46:12.020
Wow, you really aren't
like the other guys.

46:13.220 --> 46:15.622
Can you give me a ride?

46:15.624 --> 46:17.624
Why don't we walk?

46:17.626 --> 46:20.994
Walk? It's like, 20 miles.

46:20.996 --> 46:22.263
It's two.

46:23.264 --> 46:24.600
Come on.

46:42.249 --> 46:44.149
Thank you for
walking her home.

46:44.151 --> 46:45.919
It was a pleasure, sir.

46:45.921 --> 46:47.554
It was so nice
to meet you, Reagan.

46:47.556 --> 46:49.156
You too, Mrs. Walker.

46:50.525 --> 46:51.693
Take care.

46:57.099 --> 46:58.430
What a nice young man.

46:58.432 --> 47:01.266
Why doesn't he smell
like a brewery?

47:01.268 --> 47:02.635
Reagan doesn't drink.

47:02.637 --> 47:05.939
Could learn a lesson
from a kid like that.

47:05.941 --> 47:07.272
We talked about this.

47:07.274 --> 47:09.174
Yeah, and I know it
was stupid, Daddy,

47:09.176 --> 47:11.276
but I heard your voice
in my head

47:11.278 --> 47:13.813
telling me not to
drive home, so I didn't.

47:13.815 --> 47:15.447
Smart girl.

47:15.449 --> 47:18.652
But it was irresponsible of
you to leave the car there.

47:18.654 --> 47:20.285
It's an Audi.

47:20.287 --> 47:21.754
Shut the fuck up, Heather.

47:21.756 --> 47:23.589
This has nothing to do
with y... Wait, no...

47:23.591 --> 47:25.891
Too late. Keys.

47:29.764 --> 47:31.365
In.

47:33.534 --> 47:36.002
You know, I was this close
to following your advice

47:36.004 --> 47:37.636
about Heather, and now,

47:37.638 --> 47:39.772
for the next week,
I'll be riding the bus.

47:39.774 --> 47:42.441
Well, at least you'll be
reducing your carbon footprint.

47:42.443 --> 47:44.978
It's like every time
she opens her mouth,

47:44.980 --> 47:46.612
I just want to strangle her.

47:46.614 --> 47:48.346
Uh, Reagan.

47:48.348 --> 47:49.782
Uh, Ben.

47:49.784 --> 47:50.983
We're gonna talk and
you're gonna listen.

47:51.986 --> 47:52.985
Should I leave?

47:52.987 --> 47:54.586
No. They are.

47:54.588 --> 47:55.788
I'll leave when
I'm good and ready.

47:55.790 --> 47:57.089
Jesus, Ben, chill.

47:57.091 --> 47:58.524
Stay the fuck out
of this, Mary Alice.

47:58.526 --> 47:59.892
You're supposed to be in
your cheer uniform today.

47:59.894 --> 48:01.226
Give me a break.

48:01.228 --> 48:04.563
We're not doing
this here, Ben.

48:04.565 --> 48:06.233
Go away.

48:07.903 --> 48:09.802
Ben. Don't fight.

48:09.804 --> 48:11.138
Please?

48:11.939 --> 48:13.337
Don't fucking pull me.

48:13.339 --> 48:15.142
What's wrong with him?

48:17.611 --> 48:18.610
Nothing.

48:18.612 --> 48:20.211
He'll get over it.

48:20.213 --> 48:22.416
Probably on his period.

48:27.521 --> 48:29.688
I've been going through
the files in each case.

48:29.690 --> 48:31.724
Look at that photo,
tell me what you see.

48:31.726 --> 48:33.558
Mmm, nothing.

48:33.560 --> 48:34.592
Uh, road.

48:34.594 --> 48:36.627
Exactly. A road.

48:36.629 --> 48:37.930
No skid marks.

48:37.932 --> 48:40.199
They just decided to drive
full speed off a cliff?

48:40.201 --> 48:41.432
Mm, probably not.

48:41.434 --> 48:42.935
No. You're goddamn right
probably not.

48:42.937 --> 48:44.970
Did we ever have that vehicle
checked for tampering?

48:44.972 --> 48:46.872
You know we didn't,
Cliff.

48:46.874 --> 48:49.675
It's probably crushed
in some junkyard.

48:49.677 --> 48:50.845
Shit.

48:54.782 --> 48:56.849
Hey.

48:56.851 --> 48:59.218
Anything come up on the kid's,
uh, Internet activity?

48:59.220 --> 49:01.252
No. Since we broke about
a dozen laws looking,

49:01.254 --> 49:03.222
I'd appreciate it
if you shut the fuck up.

49:03.224 --> 49:04.388
Come on, nothing?

49:04.390 --> 49:07.291
That kid is off the grid.

49:07.293 --> 49:09.295
He must be a Luddite.

49:10.831 --> 49:12.697
But, a 17-year-old Luddite?

49:12.699 --> 49:14.666
That doesn't sound the least
bit suspicious to you?

49:14.668 --> 49:16.969
I try not to judge people based
on their preferences, Cliff.

49:16.971 --> 49:20.072
I have a brother-in-law who
spends all day in the park,

49:20.074 --> 49:21.773
fanny pack full
of bird seed.

49:21.775 --> 49:23.407
Does puppet shows
for the homeless.

49:23.409 --> 49:25.710
Doesn't make him
a criminal.

49:25.712 --> 49:27.812
I can feel this one
in my gut, Ronnie.

49:27.814 --> 49:29.349
Or you're obsessing.

49:32.786 --> 49:33.818
Okay, maybe you're right.

49:33.820 --> 49:35.622
I know I'm right.

49:49.434 --> 49:51.269
Hey, look what I made!

49:51.271 --> 49:52.436
It's neat and it's...

49:52.438 --> 49:54.304
Shut up and get me a beer.
Now!

49:54.306 --> 49:56.242
Stupid kids.

51:02.342 --> 51:04.075
I don't think we should
pay him any more.

51:04.077 --> 51:05.675
Well, what the fuck do
you think we're doing here?

51:05.677 --> 51:07.311
Of course we're not
paying him any more.

51:07.313 --> 51:09.548
If he thinks he can
fuck with us, I'll...

51:12.051 --> 51:13.452
Drive.

51:15.154 --> 51:17.387
So, have you figured out
what you wanted to say yet?

51:17.389 --> 51:18.625
Yeah, we did.

51:20.126 --> 51:21.390
Next time,
would you guys mind

51:21.392 --> 51:22.525
being a little bit
more discreet?

51:22.527 --> 51:25.363
Fuck you! We're done.

51:26.366 --> 51:27.564
Done?

51:27.566 --> 51:29.335
I'm sorry, with what?

51:30.135 --> 51:31.269
Tell him, Ben.

51:31.271 --> 51:33.204
Yeah, tell me, Ben.

51:33.206 --> 51:34.406
We're not paying you
any more.

51:35.807 --> 51:37.241
Excuse me?

51:37.243 --> 51:38.376
He's right.

51:38.378 --> 51:40.410
Okay, we've paid enough.

51:40.412 --> 51:42.280
I mean, do you have any idea
how bad we feel

51:42.282 --> 51:43.981
about what we've done?

51:43.983 --> 51:45.581
I can barely sleep at night.

51:45.583 --> 51:48.151
The stress is
ruining our lives.

51:48.153 --> 51:50.253
- The stress?
- Yeah.

51:50.255 --> 51:53.423
Your parents were ruining your
lives with their homophobia,

51:53.425 --> 51:54.624
their fat-shaming,

51:54.626 --> 51:55.926
and their
complete unwillingness

51:55.928 --> 51:59.763
and inability to deal
with your... qualities.

51:59.765 --> 52:01.765
We gave you that referral.
All right?

52:01.767 --> 52:05.971
With what we already gave you,
that should be enough.

52:07.940 --> 52:09.638
You're forgetting
our terms, Ben.

52:09.640 --> 52:11.408
Yeah, well, there's
new terms, Reagan.

52:11.410 --> 52:13.511
Leave us alone or...

52:14.880 --> 52:16.645
We'll go to Kenny's dad.

52:16.647 --> 52:18.982
Yeah.

52:18.984 --> 52:21.084
We'll go to Kenny's dad,
and we'll tell him

52:21.086 --> 52:23.520
it was all your idea to
murder all these parents,

52:23.522 --> 52:25.891
and we were too afraid
to do anything.

52:27.360 --> 52:29.125
Okay, Dawkins?

52:29.127 --> 52:30.593
Really? That's your plan.

52:30.595 --> 52:32.298
Yeah.

52:38.270 --> 52:39.601
<i>Ben and Becky Wallace</i>

52:39.603 --> 52:42.072
<i>murder solicitation,
August 15th.</i>

52:42.074 --> 52:44.140
<i>All right,
Reagan, we've decided.</i>

52:44.142 --> 52:46.642
<i>They suck, we want them dead.</i>

52:46.644 --> 52:47.944
<i>And my terms
are acceptable?</i>

52:47.946 --> 52:48.812
<i>Yes!</i>

52:48.814 --> 52:50.716
<i>Yes, the sooner the better.</i>

52:54.920 --> 52:56.088
Fuck me.

52:57.389 --> 52:59.289
Fuck.

52:59.291 --> 53:01.391
Whatever, just pay him, Ben.

53:01.393 --> 53:02.624
We're rich...

53:02.626 --> 53:03.892
Not if you keep ordering
all those fucking

53:03.894 --> 53:05.794
vintage Playgirl
magazines off eBay.

53:05.796 --> 53:07.998
Well, at least I'm not
the one who blew two grand

53:08.000 --> 53:09.765
on laser hair removal.

53:09.767 --> 53:13.203
I'll expect my cut
off the insurance money.

53:13.205 --> 53:15.005
If your reference pays off,

53:15.007 --> 53:16.840
I'll give you guys
a nice refund.

53:16.842 --> 53:17.843
Okay?

53:20.112 --> 53:21.112
Okay.

53:23.047 --> 53:25.482
- Okay.
- Okay.

53:25.484 --> 53:27.816
By the way, nothing
says grieving orphans

53:27.818 --> 53:29.854
like an $80,000 Mercedes.

53:44.069 --> 53:45.903
Hey, Reagan?

53:47.004 --> 53:49.106
Hell of a nice car
that boy's got.

53:50.641 --> 53:52.441
I guess.

53:52.443 --> 53:54.243
I'm not much of a car guy.

53:54.245 --> 53:56.678
Really? Oh, I am.

53:56.680 --> 53:58.747
Although, on a detective's
salary I'll never have

53:58.749 --> 54:00.849
a ride like that, but man,

54:00.851 --> 54:03.585
there's something about that
new car smell, isn't there?

54:03.587 --> 54:04.822
Yeah, I guess.

54:06.158 --> 54:08.024
They give you
another payment?

54:08.026 --> 54:09.224
What?

54:09.226 --> 54:10.691
Come on, Reagan.

54:10.693 --> 54:12.163
Don't try to shit
a shitter.

54:15.698 --> 54:17.166
How long have you known?

54:17.168 --> 54:20.069
I'm a lot smarter than
you think I am, son.

54:20.071 --> 54:21.570
That's good.

54:21.572 --> 54:23.138
'Cause honestly, the guilt
was starting to get to me.

54:26.445 --> 54:28.344
Are you sure you can't
just take it and let me go?

54:28.346 --> 54:29.945
I... I know it's illegal
to download music

54:29.947 --> 54:32.183
that I didn't buy, but I
wasn't planning on selling it.

54:33.350 --> 54:34.383
What are you talking about?

54:34.385 --> 54:37.386
Copyright laws.
We broke them.

54:37.388 --> 54:38.586
You got me.

54:38.588 --> 54:40.055
Copyright laws?

54:40.057 --> 54:42.224
Yeah. Just don't bring
Ben and Becky down for this.

54:42.226 --> 54:44.226
I mean, they've had it
hard enough with their parents

54:44.228 --> 54:45.429
and everything.

54:47.465 --> 54:50.265
Copyright laws. That's...
That's cute, Reagan.

54:50.267 --> 54:51.333
How old are you? 16?

54:51.335 --> 54:53.068
- 17.
- 17.

54:53.070 --> 54:53.902
It's a good age.

54:53.904 --> 54:55.137
I mean, you look
like an adult,

54:55.139 --> 54:56.506
but you're still a kid.

54:56.508 --> 54:58.574
Got your driver's license,
a year left in high school.

55:00.444 --> 55:01.742
<i>August 15th...</i>

55:01.744 --> 55:03.778
Yeah, it's not bad,
I'll say.

55:03.780 --> 55:07.882
I mean, the only thing you could really do to screw
it up would be to do something really stupid.

55:07.884 --> 55:08.816
Like what?

55:08.818 --> 55:10.454
I don't know,
kill somebody?

55:13.090 --> 55:15.656
Maybe several people?

55:15.658 --> 55:18.260
I mean, because if you
did something like that,

55:18.262 --> 55:22.029
I think the law would start looking
at you like you were an adult.

55:22.031 --> 55:23.800
Then you'd be pretty darned
fucked, wouldn't you?

55:24.968 --> 55:27.003
I guess I'm lucky
I'm just a music pirate.

55:28.439 --> 55:30.073
Yeah, lucky indeed.

55:34.711 --> 55:38.247
So, Detective, I...
I know what I did was wrong,

55:38.249 --> 55:40.884
but is there any way
I could get my player back?

55:48.992 --> 55:49.993
All right.

55:52.695 --> 55:54.896
But one slip-up from you,

55:54.898 --> 55:58.001
and I will be on you like
bird shit on a shiny new car.

56:09.345 --> 56:10.547
Hey, pal.

56:11.381 --> 56:12.748
Why the long face?

56:14.350 --> 56:16.817
Oh, nothing, just
a long day, I guess.

56:16.819 --> 56:18.486
Oh, this ought
to cheer you up.

56:18.488 --> 56:20.688
Chief Brooks called
my office this morning

56:20.690 --> 56:23.057
raving about what a wonderful,
caring son we have.

56:23.059 --> 56:23.925
Really?

56:23.927 --> 56:25.893
Yeah, couldn't get her to stop.

56:25.895 --> 56:27.728
You know, all that peer
counseling you're doing?

56:27.730 --> 56:30.733
Reagan, people notice.
Colleges will notice.

56:32.269 --> 56:33.267
You might be right, Dad.

56:33.269 --> 56:34.768
Yeah.

56:34.770 --> 56:36.703
Oh, by the way, uh, a young
lady just called for you.

56:36.705 --> 56:38.372
Your mom has been
on the phone with her

56:38.374 --> 56:39.839
for the last 20 minutes.

56:39.841 --> 56:42.310
- Oh.
- Yeah, better get in there.

56:42.312 --> 56:43.710
Mother?

56:43.712 --> 56:45.012
...Modern dance troupe
in college.

56:45.014 --> 56:46.681
- Mom.
- Yeah... I had videos,

56:46.683 --> 56:48.316
- if you wanna see.
- Mom? Mom.

56:48.318 --> 56:49.383
It's a girl.

56:49.385 --> 56:50.720
I know.
Give me the phone.

56:52.722 --> 56:55.223
- Hey.
- <i>Hi.</i>

56:55.225 --> 56:56.525
<i>Your mom's pretty cool.</i>

56:56.527 --> 56:58.925
Sometimes. What's up?

56:58.927 --> 57:02.162
Mm, well, I'm at the
library at your suggestion.

57:02.164 --> 57:03.364
<i>And?</i>

57:03.366 --> 57:05.233
Not bad.

57:05.235 --> 57:06.434
Don't tell anyone,

57:06.436 --> 57:08.069
but I smuggled a latte in.

57:08.071 --> 57:09.437
You wanna join?

57:09.439 --> 57:11.272
Oh, well, actually
I have to...

57:11.274 --> 57:13.176
Did I mention
I'm completely sober?

57:16.045 --> 57:18.915
Actually, there is something
you can do for me.

57:20.049 --> 57:22.549
- Thanks, Mrs. Flanders.
- Mm-hmm.

57:22.551 --> 57:23.651
Hi.

57:23.653 --> 57:25.151
Thank you.

57:25.153 --> 57:26.955
Mary Alice, right?

57:28.591 --> 57:30.257
You're a cheerleader here.

57:30.259 --> 57:31.459
Yeah.

57:31.461 --> 57:33.760
I'm Detective Dawkins.

57:33.762 --> 57:36.096
I interviewed you about
Tom Mulnick's father?

57:36.098 --> 57:37.100
Right.

57:39.435 --> 57:40.637
Trees.

57:41.638 --> 57:43.039
Big fan.

57:45.007 --> 57:48.642
Okay, well, just
wanted to say hello.

57:48.644 --> 57:50.112
Hello.

57:51.313 --> 57:52.781
Hello. Okay.

58:01.391 --> 58:05.158
<i>Periods of light rain growing
steadier after midnight.</i>

58:05.160 --> 58:07.927
<i>Lows in the mid-50s
and we're going to see</i>

58:07.929 --> 58:09.962
<i>some wet roads for
the morning commute.</i>

58:09.964 --> 58:13.967
Ah, The Weather Channel again.

58:13.969 --> 58:15.602
You'd tell me
if you were

58:15.604 --> 58:17.871
gonna become
a meteorologist, right?

58:17.873 --> 58:20.040
What? Yeah.

58:20.042 --> 58:23.143
So, you mind if I,
uh, watch the news?

58:23.145 --> 58:24.511
All yours.

58:24.513 --> 58:25.814
Good.

58:27.082 --> 58:28.848
Hey.

58:28.850 --> 58:31.321
You figure out what you're
gonna do for a summer job yet?

58:32.521 --> 58:34.356
I'm starting my own business.

59:17.499 --> 59:20.233
So, you're meeting me at
Alta Park, big gazebo thing.

59:20.235 --> 59:21.633
3:30, okay?

59:21.635 --> 59:23.035
I'll be there.

59:23.037 --> 59:24.937
- Are... yeah, you sure?
- I won't be late.

59:24.939 --> 59:28.407
Hey, buddy. What's up?

59:28.409 --> 59:30.377
Hi, Grant.

59:30.379 --> 59:32.445
This isn't smart.

59:32.447 --> 59:33.713
Geez, I'm just saying hi.

59:33.715 --> 59:36.282
Now you did. Okay?
I'll see you later.

59:36.284 --> 59:39.254
You know, you're
a very rude person.

59:42.057 --> 59:43.256
Who the hell was that?

59:43.258 --> 59:44.290
That was just Grant.

59:44.292 --> 59:46.492
- I'll see you at
the big gazebo? -30?

59:46.494 --> 59:47.895
Yeah, sure.

01:00:29.604 --> 01:00:30.637
Yah!

01:00:53.093 --> 01:00:55.762
And, just so you know,
money isn't a problem.

01:00:55.764 --> 01:00:57.798
- Just let me know how much.
- Okay.

01:00:58.998 --> 01:01:01.834
And hey, once my dad and
Heather are out of the way,

01:01:01.836 --> 01:01:03.802
then we can really have fun.

01:01:03.804 --> 01:01:06.438
- We got it.
- Sounds good.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:10.309
So, on Saturday I was thinking
the bluff at Haver Point.

01:01:10.311 --> 01:01:11.777
I thought I was
gonna be planning this?

01:01:11.779 --> 01:01:13.345
I didn't mean, I just...
I just thought...

01:01:13.347 --> 01:01:17.516
Actually...
Haver Point is perfect.

01:01:17.518 --> 01:01:18.552
Great.

01:01:20.386 --> 01:01:24.121
I got you,
you twisted little shit.

01:01:24.123 --> 01:01:28.494
Don't you ever mess with
Detective Clifford Art Dawkins.

01:01:28.496 --> 01:01:30.396
Yes. Fuck yes!

01:01:36.737 --> 01:01:38.871
Full house.
Aces over fives.

01:01:38.873 --> 01:01:40.239
- Oh, come on, man.
- Are you serious?

01:01:40.241 --> 01:01:43.509
Yes, I'm limping.
No, it's not broken.

01:01:43.511 --> 01:01:44.842
What the hell, Cliff?

01:01:44.844 --> 01:01:46.744
I got him cold, brother.
First degree murder.

01:01:46.746 --> 01:01:48.412
Aw, shit.

01:01:48.414 --> 01:01:49.982
Got whom cold?

01:01:49.984 --> 01:01:51.215
Oh, no.
Cliff, no.

01:01:51.217 --> 01:01:52.483
Chief, I know what
you're thinking,

01:01:52.485 --> 01:01:54.452
and here's what I have
to say to that.

01:01:54.454 --> 01:01:57.290
In your face.

01:02:00.393 --> 01:02:03.662
Shit. Hold up.

01:02:03.664 --> 01:02:05.096
Shit.

01:02:05.098 --> 01:02:07.666
You should have had
that cued up better.

01:02:07.668 --> 01:02:08.900
Okay.

01:02:08.902 --> 01:02:09.901
<i>How can I
say no to that?</i>

01:02:09.903 --> 01:02:11.369
<i>Good.</i>

01:02:11.371 --> 01:02:12.837
<i>And, just so you know,
money isn't a problem,</i>

01:02:12.839 --> 01:02:14.539
<i>just let me know how much.</i>

01:02:14.541 --> 01:02:15.974
<i>Okay.</i>

01:02:15.976 --> 01:02:18.209
<i>And hey, once my dad
and Heather are out of the way,</i>

01:02:18.211 --> 01:02:20.645
<i>then we can really have fun.</i>

01:02:20.647 --> 01:02:21.648
<i>Sounds good.</i>

01:02:23.182 --> 01:02:25.249
There's more if
you want to hear it.

01:02:25.251 --> 01:02:26.517
Hmm.

01:02:26.519 --> 01:02:30.254
Chief, I thought this
was bullshit too,

01:02:30.256 --> 01:02:32.957
but now we have
to investigate this.

01:02:32.959 --> 01:02:34.190
I think Cliff is
right this time.

01:02:34.192 --> 01:02:35.628
I'm Adderall right.

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:38.195
You're sure about this?

01:02:38.197 --> 01:02:40.097
I'd stake my badge on it.

01:02:40.099 --> 01:02:41.432
Well,
that's good to know,

01:02:41.434 --> 01:02:42.635
'cause I'm gonna
hold you to it.

01:02:53.747 --> 01:02:55.415
Ah!

01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:02.154
Ah, goddamn that
skinny motherfucker.

01:03:30.917 --> 01:03:31.916
How we lookin'?

01:03:31.918 --> 01:03:33.818
Nothin' yet.

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:34.819
- Ow!
- Oh!

01:03:34.821 --> 01:03:37.622
Goddamnit, Sam!

01:03:37.624 --> 01:03:39.256
Watch it!

01:03:39.258 --> 01:03:40.958
Dude, that-that thing
is really gnarly.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.894
Why don't you just chill here in the
van and we'll go take care of this.

01:03:43.896 --> 01:03:45.895
It's my operation, and
I'm not gonna sit it out.

01:03:45.897 --> 01:03:48.933
And I'm not your dude, so
just watch out for the foot.

01:03:50.469 --> 01:03:51.267
"Gnarly."

01:03:51.269 --> 01:03:52.469
- Hey, Sam.
- Yeah.

01:03:52.471 --> 01:03:53.538
Shut up.

01:04:03.348 --> 01:04:05.116
That's it.
That's it.

01:04:05.118 --> 01:04:06.182
That's it, that's the car.

01:04:06.184 --> 01:04:07.987
All right, let's roll.

01:04:09.855 --> 01:04:11.323
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:18.163
Ah, goddamnit!

01:04:23.301 --> 01:04:24.503
Come on, come on, come on.

01:04:25.537 --> 01:04:27.772
Fan out.
Fan out.

01:04:27.774 --> 01:04:29.073
<i>Does anybody see anything?</i>

01:04:29.075 --> 01:04:31.776
Ronnie, do not engage
until my go.

01:04:31.778 --> 01:04:33.143
<i>Fan out and stay quiet.</i>

01:04:33.145 --> 01:04:35.045
Does anybody hear anything?

01:04:35.047 --> 01:04:36.146
Oh, fuck.

01:04:36.148 --> 01:04:37.683
Oh, motherfucker.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:41.051
Do not engage.
I repeat, do not engage.

01:04:42.554 --> 01:04:44.155
No, no, no.
You're too close to the edge.

01:04:44.157 --> 01:04:46.256
No, no, no, that's
too close to the edge.

01:04:46.258 --> 01:04:48.360
Go! Go! Go!

01:04:51.229 --> 01:04:52.228
- Freeze! Freeze!
- Ah!

01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:54.266
Police! Nobody move.

01:04:55.702 --> 01:04:57.069
Oh...

01:05:03.575 --> 01:05:05.709
It's fine.

01:05:05.711 --> 01:05:08.714
Looks like you really screwed
the pooch on this one, dude.

01:05:15.188 --> 01:05:18.089
They were taking senior
pictures for the yearbook.

01:05:18.091 --> 01:05:19.924
How could you...

01:05:19.926 --> 01:05:21.827
How could I
be so stupid?

01:05:23.061 --> 01:05:24.293
He set me up.

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:26.397
Not everything is
a conspiracy, Super Cop.

01:05:28.066 --> 01:05:30.200
You slapped a fellow officer.

01:05:30.202 --> 01:05:33.670
The Collins family is
getting a restraining order.

01:05:33.672 --> 01:05:35.239
You see where
I'm going with this?

01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:58.962
Get some help, Cliff.

01:05:58.964 --> 01:06:00.864
No, actually...

01:06:00.866 --> 01:06:02.264
take a shower first.

01:06:02.266 --> 01:06:03.802
And then get some help.

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:27.322
<i>So, it's gonna be mostly
cloudy with periods of sun,</i>

01:06:27.324 --> 01:06:28.892
<i>temperatures in the mid-70s.</i>

01:06:28.894 --> 01:06:31.293
<i>Friday night will bring
severe thunderstorms</i>

01:06:31.295 --> 01:06:35.063
<i>with winds of up
to 50 miles an hour.</i>

01:06:35.065 --> 01:06:38.335
<i>So batten down your hatches,
it's gonna be a rough one.</i>

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:50.815
So that's where
my Vicodin went.

01:06:52.117 --> 01:06:54.652
You're mixing them
with alcohol? Nice.

01:06:57.922 --> 01:06:59.621
I got suspended today,

01:06:59.623 --> 01:07:01.490
so if you could tone back the
judgment a little bit, that...

01:07:01.492 --> 01:07:04.595
Can't you see what's
happening, Cliff?

01:07:06.931 --> 01:07:09.731
I see that Reagan Collins
has killed six people.

01:07:09.733 --> 01:07:13.203
And now you're gonna lose
your job over it.

01:07:13.205 --> 01:07:14.738
Can you just stop?

01:07:18.609 --> 01:07:20.374
No.

01:07:20.376 --> 01:07:22.512
I'm right about this, Connie.

01:07:26.616 --> 01:07:27.718
Okay.

01:07:31.555 --> 01:07:32.623
Okay.

01:08:17.368 --> 01:08:21.002
Oh, yes, oh.
Hector. Hector! Hector!

01:08:21.005 --> 01:08:22.572
Hector! Oh!

01:08:24.875 --> 01:08:27.309
Oh, yes, right there.
Oh, right there!

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:29.745
Mommy's doing sex
with Hector again.

01:08:29.747 --> 01:08:31.413
Yep.

01:08:32.582 --> 01:08:34.015
Oh!

01:08:34.017 --> 01:08:36.082
Oh, Hector, you're so big.

01:08:36.085 --> 01:08:37.921
Yes, Hector's naughty!

01:08:51.234 --> 01:08:52.566
Oh, yes!

01:08:52.568 --> 01:08:55.170
Yes. Yes.
Yes, oh, Hector.

01:08:55.171 --> 01:08:56.939
Hector. Hector.

01:08:58.675 --> 01:09:00.107
Hector!

01:09:05.948 --> 01:09:07.450
Oh my God!

01:09:09.118 --> 01:09:11.252
Are they gonna be okay?

01:09:11.255 --> 01:09:13.790
Maybe. I don't know.

01:09:36.679 --> 01:09:40.715
No. Don't even get out.

01:09:40.716 --> 01:09:42.082
He killed another one,
didn't he?

01:09:42.085 --> 01:09:44.084
No, the storm killed them.

01:09:44.086 --> 01:09:47.154
Wind blew, branch fell,
car exploded.

01:09:47.156 --> 01:09:48.488
It's called an act of God.

01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:50.457
And that's not the least
bit fishy to you?

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:51.825
Ronnie, that's the kid's M.O.

01:09:51.827 --> 01:09:53.260
Forensic's already
been through here.

01:09:53.261 --> 01:09:56.230
Come on, Ronnie, be a detective
for once in your life.

01:09:56.232 --> 01:09:58.199
How many more parents
have to die...

01:09:58.201 --> 01:09:59.200
- before you...
- Cliff...

01:09:59.202 --> 01:10:00.703
Go home.

01:10:02.138 --> 01:10:04.407
- Officer.
- Yes, Detective?

01:10:07.176 --> 01:10:08.543
Fuck you, Ronnie.

01:10:28.865 --> 01:10:30.064
Hi there.

01:10:30.066 --> 01:10:31.432
Stay away from me.

01:10:31.434 --> 01:10:33.199
Nope, I just need
a minute of your time.

01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:36.369
Why can't you
just leave us alone?

01:10:36.371 --> 01:10:37.270
Oh, us?

01:10:37.272 --> 01:10:38.738
Oh, I'd rethink that
if I were you.

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:39.672
That kid's a murderer.

01:10:39.674 --> 01:10:41.674
Oh, give me a break.

01:10:41.676 --> 01:10:43.576
You know Grant Hall?
He's a student here?

01:10:43.578 --> 01:10:44.844
- Who?
- Oh, come on.

01:10:44.846 --> 01:10:47.515
I saw you and Reagan
with him the other day.

01:10:47.517 --> 01:10:49.383
Grant's mother and
her boyfriend were killed

01:10:49.385 --> 01:10:51.154
last night
by a falling tree.

01:10:54.123 --> 01:10:55.989
Wait, a tree?

01:10:55.991 --> 01:10:57.390
Yeah, look into it.

01:10:57.392 --> 01:10:59.526
And while you're at it,
look into the Wallace twins

01:10:59.528 --> 01:11:01.161
and Sydney Vaughn
and Tom Mulnick.

01:11:01.163 --> 01:11:03.463
Your boyfriend killed
their parents too.

01:11:03.465 --> 01:11:05.265
Just look into it.

01:11:05.267 --> 01:11:07.569
And if you want to talk,
you know where to find me.

01:11:11.973 --> 01:11:15.708
<i>Two well-known foraging
experts, Gary and Betty Vaughn,</i>

01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:17.710
<i>were found dead inside
their home today</i>

01:11:17.712 --> 01:11:20.547
<i>and it may have been
mistaken identity.</i>

01:11:20.549 --> 01:11:22.148
<i>Sydney!</i>

01:11:22.150 --> 01:11:23.950
<i>Sydney, are you surprised
your parents made</i>

01:11:23.952 --> 01:11:26.019
<i>such a careless
and deadly mistake?</i>

01:11:26.021 --> 01:11:29.524
<i>Oh, I don't know.
Why don't you suck my dick?</i>

01:11:34.763 --> 01:11:36.696
<i>This tragic series
of completely unrelated</i>

01:11:36.698 --> 01:11:38.164
<i>and terribly unlucky events</i>

01:11:38.166 --> 01:11:41.803
<i>continues to plague
this upscale community.</i>

01:12:00.589 --> 01:12:02.755
I knew you'd come
to your senses.

01:12:02.757 --> 01:12:04.924
Let's go get
this fucking asshole.

01:12:04.926 --> 01:12:07.127
Are you sure about this?
He was so nice to me.

01:12:07.129 --> 01:12:09.761
He's dared me to catch him.
More than once.

01:12:09.763 --> 01:12:11.096
I checked out all
the articles online

01:12:11.098 --> 01:12:13.866
about the dead parents
and you were right.

01:12:13.868 --> 01:12:16.034
He even got me to check out
a book on tree anatomy.

01:12:16.036 --> 01:12:17.703
I know.
I need your help.

01:12:17.705 --> 01:12:19.372
What do you mean?

01:12:19.374 --> 01:12:21.107
Go see him.

01:12:21.109 --> 01:12:22.674
Wear a wire,
search his house.

01:12:22.676 --> 01:12:25.644
No. No fucking way.
I should never have come here.

01:12:25.646 --> 01:12:28.314
Well, no, you're the only
one that can do it.

01:12:28.316 --> 01:12:30.152
Think of those poor parents.

01:12:32.286 --> 01:12:33.886
Why me?

01:12:33.888 --> 01:12:36.523
Because I'm not exactly on
the top of his guest list,

01:12:36.525 --> 01:12:37.992
but you are.

01:12:52.474 --> 01:12:55.575
Reagan. You have company.

01:13:04.818 --> 01:13:07.654
You're right, Dr. Collins,
he was really cute.

01:13:07.656 --> 01:13:09.524
Such a cute face.

01:13:10.824 --> 01:13:12.824
You should have told me
you were stopping by.

01:13:12.826 --> 01:13:14.561
I can't hang out right now.

01:13:14.563 --> 01:13:16.229
Oh, honey, who could
be more important

01:13:16.231 --> 01:13:17.664
than this beautiful girl?

01:13:17.666 --> 01:13:19.665
I'm supposed to meet
Grant... uh, a friend.

01:13:19.667 --> 01:13:21.766
<i>Oh, why don't you
tell Grant to come here?</i>

01:13:21.768 --> 01:13:23.902
No, you son of a bitch.

01:13:23.904 --> 01:13:25.470
You know what,
it's... it's fine.

01:13:25.472 --> 01:13:27.539
Actually, I'll just tell him
I'll see him another time.

01:13:27.541 --> 01:13:29.041
Well, I better go.

01:13:29.043 --> 01:13:32.344
Reagan bought us opera
tickets for our anniversary.

01:13:32.346 --> 01:13:33.613
Oh...

01:13:33.615 --> 01:13:35.080
Opera's for assholes.

01:13:35.082 --> 01:13:37.684
<i>Oh, well, happy
anniversary. Is it today?</i>

01:13:37.686 --> 01:13:39.017
<i>Yes, it sure is.</i>

01:13:39.019 --> 01:13:40.386
<i>So I better finish
getting ready.</i>

01:13:40.388 --> 01:13:41.588
Oh, sure.

01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:42.589
Why don't you...

01:13:42.591 --> 01:13:44.523
stay for dinner?

01:13:44.525 --> 01:13:46.625
Reagan is a wonderful cook.

01:13:46.627 --> 01:13:48.427
Mom...

01:13:48.429 --> 01:13:49.860
Do you wanna
stay for dinner?

01:13:49.862 --> 01:13:53.265
<i>Sure. I'd love to.</i>

01:13:53.267 --> 01:13:54.969
<i>Okay. After you.</i>

01:13:56.103 --> 01:13:58.537
<i>You in the mood for
anything special?</i>

01:13:58.539 --> 01:14:01.106
Steak, pasta, lobster Newberg?

01:14:01.108 --> 01:14:04.042
What the fuck is
lobster Newberg?

01:14:04.044 --> 01:14:07.045
<i>Well, we have eggs.</i>

01:14:07.047 --> 01:14:09.080
Well, that was
my next suggestion.

01:14:09.082 --> 01:14:10.248
Let's see.

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:13.652
Can make us an omelet,
uh, ham, cheese,

01:14:13.654 --> 01:14:16.188
uh, mushrooms?

01:14:16.190 --> 01:14:18.923
No, no, no.
No. No mushrooms.

01:14:18.925 --> 01:14:21.460
<i>No, no, no.
No mushrooms for me.</i>

01:14:21.462 --> 01:14:22.961
Oh, do you mind
if I take a shower?

01:14:22.963 --> 01:14:25.032
I'm kind of sweaty
after my run.

01:14:28.769 --> 01:14:30.202
<i>Uh, yeah, I guess so.</i>

01:14:30.204 --> 01:14:31.902
<i>Uh, upstairs,
first door on the right.</i>

01:14:31.904 --> 01:14:33.504
- <i>Okay, great. Thanks.</i>
- Smart girl.

01:14:33.506 --> 01:14:34.941
Smart girl. Smart girl.

01:14:39.747 --> 01:14:41.446
<i>I hate you for
making me do this.</i>

01:14:41.448 --> 01:14:42.748
<i>Where the fuck...</i>

01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:44.685
You shut the fuck up
and keep looking.

01:14:46.853 --> 01:14:48.520
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:14:48.522 --> 01:14:49.755
- Oh...
- Close that drawer.

01:14:49.757 --> 01:14:51.123
Oh, shit.

01:14:51.125 --> 01:14:54.092
I... I just wanted to
see your bedroom.

01:14:54.094 --> 01:14:55.227
Oh, really?

01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:56.994
Well, I don't like people
in my bedroom, so come on.

01:14:56.996 --> 01:14:58.262
- Let's go.
- Oh, shit.

01:14:58.264 --> 01:14:59.597
<i>I'm sorry.
I know this looks bad.</i>

01:14:59.599 --> 01:15:00.598
<i>I was just curious.</i>

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.866
<i>About what, exactly?</i>

01:15:01.868 --> 01:15:02.867
- <i>Uh...</i>
- <i>Curious about what?</i>

01:15:02.869 --> 01:15:04.235
<i>Oh, wait, I left my bag.</i>

01:15:04.237 --> 01:15:06.772
<i>I said I don't like
people in my room.</i>

01:15:06.774 --> 01:15:08.939
<i>Come back here.</i>

01:15:08.941 --> 01:15:10.676
- <i>What is that?</i>
- <i>Nothing.</i>

01:15:10.678 --> 01:15:12.346
<i>Let... Let go.
You're hurting me.</i>

01:15:13.813 --> 01:15:15.349
Mary, what the fuck?

01:15:31.699 --> 01:15:33.801
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

01:15:48.648 --> 01:15:50.116
Get in. Get in.
Get in.

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:55.052
Okay, give me
whatever you took.

01:15:55.054 --> 01:15:56.754
Wha... how do you know
I took anything?

01:15:56.756 --> 01:15:58.022
I saw him tearing
apart his room.

01:15:58.024 --> 01:15:59.825
You must have taken
something.

01:15:59.827 --> 01:16:01.027
Come on.

01:16:10.202 --> 01:16:12.270
Or, I... I...

01:16:15.408 --> 01:16:16.409
It's down...

01:16:20.246 --> 01:16:23.414
<i>Murder solicitation,
Tom Mulnick, September 21st.</i>

01:16:23.416 --> 01:16:26.083
<i>He never listens
to anything I say.</i>

01:16:26.085 --> 01:16:28.285
<i>He's wasted all the time.</i>

01:16:28.287 --> 01:16:30.221
<i>And the way he looks at
the girls I bring over.</i>

01:16:30.223 --> 01:16:33.490
<i>Shit, the way he looks
at the dog lately.</i>

01:16:33.492 --> 01:16:36.025
<i>It's all solvable
problems, Tom.</i>

01:16:36.027 --> 01:16:37.961
<i>And my terms are acceptable?</i>

01:16:37.963 --> 01:16:39.730
<i>Yeah,
whatever you want, man.</i>

01:16:39.732 --> 01:16:41.331
<i>I just want him dead.</i>

01:16:41.333 --> 01:16:42.298
Yes. Yes.

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.234
Yes, goddamnit,
I got you.

01:16:44.236 --> 01:16:45.904
W... wait, wh...
where are we going?

01:16:47.273 --> 01:16:49.540
There is no fucking way
I'm going back there.

01:16:49.542 --> 01:16:50.777
As if.

01:16:52.445 --> 01:16:53.611
Hey, I needed that!

01:16:53.613 --> 01:16:55.880
This is next, okay?
I am not joking.

01:16:55.882 --> 01:16:57.149
Let me out.

01:16:59.886 --> 01:17:02.252
Here! Have it.

01:17:02.254 --> 01:17:04.857
Shit. You're a witness,
remember that.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.261
Goddamn cheerleaders.

01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:22.906
Yes. Yes.
It's Detective Dawkins.

01:17:22.908 --> 01:17:25.642
I... I don't know.
He just broke into my house.

01:17:25.644 --> 01:17:28.178
Yeah, he has a gun. And... and
I have a restraining order.

01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:30.048
Put the phone down.
Put the phone down.

01:17:31.751 --> 01:17:33.018
Did you call the police?

01:17:35.588 --> 01:17:37.289
Fine by me. Sit.

01:17:42.227 --> 01:17:43.795
Go for Ronnie.

01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:47.466
What?

01:17:49.501 --> 01:17:50.966
Can I get you anything?

01:17:50.968 --> 01:17:53.036
A water? Soda?

01:17:53.038 --> 01:17:55.038
Maybe some deodorant?

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.807
Just shut the fuck up,
you skinny little cunt.

01:17:57.809 --> 01:17:59.010
Okay?

01:18:01.012 --> 01:18:02.512
Breaking and entering,

01:18:02.514 --> 01:18:03.446
with a gun

01:18:03.448 --> 01:18:05.315
while being suspended.

01:18:05.317 --> 01:18:07.650
Pretty ballsy move,
don't you think, Detective?

01:18:07.652 --> 01:18:08.818
Ballsy?

01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:10.118
Ballsy's thinking
you can murder

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.386
those kids' parents
and get away with it.

01:18:11.388 --> 01:18:13.389
Murder?

01:18:13.391 --> 01:18:15.592
I like to think I was just
emancipating those kids

01:18:15.594 --> 01:18:17.125
from their home lives
by exploiting

01:18:17.127 --> 01:18:18.795
their parents' hypocrisy.

01:18:18.797 --> 01:18:20.563
Hypocrisy?

01:18:20.565 --> 01:18:22.065
You deluded little psycho.

01:18:22.067 --> 01:18:24.936
No. Think about it.

01:18:26.771 --> 01:18:29.172
If a licensed physician wasn't
exceeding the speed limit,

01:18:29.174 --> 01:18:32.844
his SUV's computer may not
have disabled the brakes.

01:18:38.182 --> 01:18:40.550
As far as that
Mr. Mulnick goes...

01:18:40.552 --> 01:18:42.117
Ahh. Ahh.

01:18:42.119 --> 01:18:44.454
It's not my fault he treated
his body like a sewage dump.

01:18:44.456 --> 01:18:47.155
like a sewage dump,
like a sewage dump.

01:18:47.157 --> 01:18:48.558
I knew that was you.

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.660
Oh, please, I just offered
the man a forty.

01:18:50.662 --> 01:18:52.128
Who wants to fuck?

01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:53.930
Don't even get me started
about the Vaughns.

01:18:53.932 --> 01:18:56.131
Who's up for vegan tacos?

01:18:56.133 --> 01:18:58.904
Professional foragers who don't
even know their own mushrooms?

01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:02.106
So, you're saying
they did it to themselves.

01:19:03.274 --> 01:19:04.275
Well...

01:19:06.043 --> 01:19:08.711
...except for the tree crushing
Hector and Grant's mom.

01:19:08.713 --> 01:19:10.381
That one's on me.

01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:14.283
No, they're all on you.

01:19:14.285 --> 01:19:15.585
And this?

01:19:17.255 --> 01:19:20.224
And this will make for
some pretty good listening.

01:19:21.659 --> 01:19:23.227
That bitch.

01:19:25.663 --> 01:19:27.665
You really think that
they're gonna believe you?

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.566
Yeah.

01:19:30.568 --> 01:19:33.135
I have a witness,
I have a recording,

01:19:33.137 --> 01:19:35.370
I saw you tear apart
your room looking for this.

01:19:35.372 --> 01:19:37.909
So, if you wanna confess now,
it's good for the soul.

01:19:39.744 --> 01:19:41.044
That's very profound.

01:19:41.046 --> 01:19:43.046
You're an arrogant
little turd.

01:19:43.048 --> 01:19:44.415
Now get up.

01:19:47.017 --> 01:19:48.817
And you're an idiot.

01:19:48.819 --> 01:19:51.219
You have a history of being wrong about me
and I have a restraining order against you.

01:19:51.221 --> 01:19:52.287
You really believe
they're gonna believe

01:19:52.289 --> 01:19:53.322
anything you have to say?

01:19:53.324 --> 01:19:55.424
You son of a bitch,
I've been a cop for 15 years.

01:19:55.426 --> 01:19:57.894
Your friends out there are
gonna 5150 your ass

01:19:57.896 --> 01:20:00.562
before you even have a chance
to spread any lies about me.

01:20:00.564 --> 01:20:03.432
Fuck your 5150.
You keep forgetting.

01:20:03.434 --> 01:20:05.167
That recording?

01:20:05.169 --> 01:20:07.535
Forensics will think you
doctored it to frame me.

01:20:07.537 --> 01:20:11.607
Cliff?
Connie just called.

01:20:11.609 --> 01:20:13.942
Told me about the booze
and the pills.

01:20:13.944 --> 01:20:15.242
She's worried about you.

01:20:15.244 --> 01:20:18.413
Connie...
that's your wife, right?

01:20:18.415 --> 01:20:21.516
How do you think she feels
about all this, huh?

01:20:21.518 --> 01:20:23.352
She probably thinks
that you're crazy,

01:20:23.354 --> 01:20:24.953
just like
everyone else does.

01:20:24.955 --> 01:20:26.490
Open it, please.

01:20:27.491 --> 01:20:28.958
Look at yourself, Cliff.

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:30.728
You're a mess.

01:20:33.864 --> 01:20:35.296
Don't!

01:20:35.298 --> 01:20:36.999
Turn around.
Turn around!

01:20:37.001 --> 01:20:38.736
Wh...

01:20:40.203 --> 01:20:42.971
Pursuant with California
penal code section 837,

01:20:42.973 --> 01:20:45.107
I am placing Reagan Collins
under citizen's arrest.

01:20:45.109 --> 01:20:46.742
This is crazy, Cliff.

01:20:46.744 --> 01:20:48.543
- Help me.
- Shut up.

01:20:48.545 --> 01:20:52.047
Listen to me, let the kid go
and we can talk.

01:20:52.049 --> 01:20:54.117
He did it, Ronnie,
he did it.

01:20:54.119 --> 01:20:55.883
I have proof.
He killed all of them.

01:20:55.885 --> 01:20:56.884
Okay? I was right.

01:20:56.886 --> 01:20:58.219
Okay, Cliff.

01:20:58.221 --> 01:20:59.754
Just let him go and
we can discuss this.

01:20:59.756 --> 01:21:03.125
Cliff! Put that gun down
this instant and let Reagan go.

01:21:03.127 --> 01:21:06.063
Chief, I got this. Okay?

01:21:07.998 --> 01:21:11.401
Cliff, I'm gonna come up now.

01:21:13.336 --> 01:21:16.705
Ronnie, just promise me
that he'll be arrested?

01:21:16.707 --> 01:21:18.540
Anything you say, buddy.

01:21:18.542 --> 01:21:19.874
I promise.

01:21:19.876 --> 01:21:23.513
Just... put the gun down.

01:21:33.090 --> 01:21:35.691
Hold your fire!

01:21:35.693 --> 01:21:36.794
Hm?

01:21:39.863 --> 01:21:41.730
No!

01:21:41.732 --> 01:21:43.698
Ronnie, I think Sam
just shot me.

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:45.366
I need an ambulance.

01:21:45.368 --> 01:21:47.435
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

01:21:47.437 --> 01:21:49.036
- Sam just shot me.
- Yes.

01:21:49.038 --> 01:21:50.404
I don't know
what I'm doing.

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:52.006
I'm sorry, honey,
I'm so sorry.

01:21:52.008 --> 01:21:53.543
It's okay.

01:21:54.844 --> 01:21:57.647
I just...

01:22:13.996 --> 01:22:15.129
<i>Officer Sam Pickett was cleared</i>

<i>This is your

<i>Sally McDuffy,
KFT, Channel Five News.</i>

01:22:53.069 --> 01:22:54.504
Oh, no.

01:23:03.578 --> 01:23:05.612
This is all your fault,
asshole.

01:23:05.614 --> 01:23:06.682
Whoa.

01:23:08.017 --> 01:23:09.349
You want me to go stop this?

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:10.684
No.

01:23:10.686 --> 01:23:12.686
No, if it doesn't happen here,
it'll happen someplace else.

01:23:12.688 --> 01:23:15.357
And he needs to face
him sooner or later.

01:23:22.265 --> 01:23:24.098
What took you
so fuckin' long?

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:26.432
I told you.

01:23:26.434 --> 01:23:28.135
These things will take time.

01:23:28.137 --> 01:23:30.470
Yeah, well, meanwhile
I'm going crazy.

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:33.140
We didn't set any
sort of time limit.

01:23:33.142 --> 01:23:35.308
Did you bring
the envelope?

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:37.146
Yeah, I brought the envelope.

01:23:39.215 --> 01:23:41.282
"Time: April 29th.

01:23:41.284 --> 01:23:44.818
Where: my porch.
How: police."

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:47.153
No fucking way!

01:23:47.155 --> 01:23:48.755
Good.

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.226
Now burn it.

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:52.859
Not... not... not now.

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:54.696
Later.

01:23:57.833 --> 01:24:01.634
All right, now
I'm gonna extend my hand.

01:24:01.636 --> 01:24:03.703
Hesitate for a moment,
then shake it.

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:05.139
What?

01:24:05.141 --> 01:24:07.876
Just shake my hand.

01:24:12.848 --> 01:24:14.147
See?

01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:16.716
Sometimes all you need
is a little faith.

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:19.786
That took guts for him
to come here today.

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:21.154
Good for him.

01:24:21.156 --> 01:24:22.891
Yeah.

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:56.488
Hey!

01:24:56.490 --> 01:24:57.725
Hey.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.195
Uh, do you have
the iPod?

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:03.762
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:25:03.764 --> 01:25:05.198
You should have
seen my switch.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.467
It was flawless.

01:25:07.434 --> 01:25:08.902
What happened
with the police?

01:25:08.904 --> 01:25:10.370
Oh, they played
the other one.

01:25:10.372 --> 01:25:13.438
114 hours
of Belgian folk music.

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:17.010
I can't believe it worked
exactly how you said it would.

01:25:17.012 --> 01:25:18.480
Of course it did.

01:25:21.448 --> 01:25:22.683
So, that's it then?

01:25:24.084 --> 01:25:26.654
Oh, yeah,
I guess that's it.

01:25:28.422 --> 01:25:29.757
Okay then...

01:25:49.276 --> 01:25:52.479
So, do you wanna get
a milk shake or something?

01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:56.483
Wait, are you asking me
out on a date?

01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:58.519
Yeah.

01:25:59.887 --> 01:26:02.390
Well, my dad still
doesn't trust you.

01:26:03.524 --> 01:26:05.459
Well, that's
a solvable problem.

01:26:09.163 --> 01:26:10.729
- Hey!
- Sweet ass.

01:26:10.731 --> 01:26:11.832
Watch it.

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:16.969
School's out,
motherfucker!

01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:18.806
Whoo!
