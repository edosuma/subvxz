00:12.543 --> 00:14.277
We need a pecking order inside, gentlemen.

00:14.377 --> 00:17.877
So we have control
on the outside. Okay? Period.

00:18.843 --> 00:20.777
- Get him!
- Aah!

00:20.877 --> 00:22.377
There're no leaders inside, Mike.

00:22.477 --> 00:23.843
Why don't you pick new leaders?

00:23.943 --> 00:25.209
There's no new leaders
to pick from.

00:25.310 --> 00:26.810
Get up, nigga!

00:28.077 --> 00:29.077
I don't wanna go.

00:29.177 --> 00:30.877
They're gonna give you
a new identity.

00:30.977 --> 00:32.743
They'll help you get a job.

00:33.677 --> 00:34.610
How's Kyle?

00:34.710 --> 00:36.176
He took a job upstate.

00:37.943 --> 00:39.243
You're lucky there wasn't
drugs on this boat,

00:39.343 --> 00:42.243
you left three guys on deck,
you didn't even frisk 'em.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.077
Everyday, you will choose

00:45.176 --> 00:46.577
whether to study

00:46.677 --> 00:48.477
or wether to blow this off.

00:48.577 --> 00:50.077
Oh!
No!

00:50.176 --> 00:51.243
Give it up you bitch!

00:57.176 --> 00:58.843
I wanna go for a walk.

00:58.943 --> 01:01.943
We can't protect you
if we're not with you.

01:02.043 --> 01:04.543
<i>So, Milo... Is he listed
on the Inmate roster?</i>

01:04.643 --> 01:07.910
What'd he do? Mike, what did he
just walk out the front gate?

02:25.810 --> 02:29.443
<i>Wars inside
means war on the outside.</i>

03:18.277 --> 03:19.877
<i>The only difference is</i>

03:19.977 --> 03:23.176
<i>no innocent victims
during the inside war.</i>

03:23.277 --> 03:27.710
<i>Outside, innocent victims
is how you fight the war.</i>

03:27.810 --> 03:29.677
<i>911, what's
your emergency?</i>

03:29.777 --> 03:33.477
I've been shot.
Everybody's been...

03:38.843 --> 03:40.310
<i>Ma'am, are you
still there?</i>

03:40.410 --> 03:42.510
<i>I heard gunfire.</i>

03:43.843 --> 03:45.343
<i>Have you been shot,
ma'am?</i>

03:48.877 --> 03:50.142
<i>If you can't speak,</i>

03:50.277 --> 03:52.877
<i>simply press any
number on your keypad.</i>

03:54.076 --> 03:56.577
<i>Good,
is the shooter still active?</i>

03:56.943 --> 03:58.410
<i>Do you know
how many victims?</i>

03:58.510 --> 04:01.343
Everybody in this motherfucker
about to be a victim.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.410
If y'all show up,

04:05.343 --> 04:08.277
you motherfuckers
gonna be victims too.

04:45.777 --> 04:46.843
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:46.942 --> 04:48.343
Hey, you heading towards
the shots fired?

04:48.443 --> 04:50.009
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- What is it?

04:50.109 --> 04:51.976
<i>Not sure. You on your way?</i>

04:55.410 --> 04:56.777
I gotta
drop something off first,

04:56.877 --> 04:58.410
but, yeah, I'll be there.

06:08.109 --> 06:10.277
Come on, please answer.

06:11.477 --> 06:13.643
- Come on. Hi.
- <i>Hey, Mike.</i>

06:13.942 --> 06:15.277
What are you doing?

06:15.377 --> 06:17.610
<i>Um, none
of your business.</i>

06:18.277 --> 06:20.277
Well, how long
are you gonna be doing that?

06:20.277 --> 06:21.842
<i>Well,
the hope is all night.</i>

06:21.942 --> 06:23.377
<i>What do you need?</i>

06:23.477 --> 06:25.976
Fucking come on.
All right, never mind, sorry.

06:26.076 --> 06:28.710
Fuck. Jesus.

06:30.710 --> 06:32.042
<i>Come on.</i>

06:35.142 --> 06:37.577
- <i>Yeah, what's up?</i>
- What are you doing?

06:38.042 --> 06:40.710
What? Well, I was
fucking sleeping.

06:40.809 --> 06:41.942
<i>What's up?</i>

06:42.042 --> 06:43.610
I gotta drop something by
for you to watch.

06:43.710 --> 06:46.443
<i>What you get,
like, a dog or something?</i>

06:46.543 --> 06:48.142
I did not.

06:48.277 --> 06:49.876
<i>Well, what is it, Mike?</i>

06:49.976 --> 06:51.543
I'm gonna be there in a minute.

06:51.643 --> 06:53.076
<i>All right.</i>

06:58.176 --> 06:59.677
I don't need a babysitter.

07:00.310 --> 07:03.710
No, what you need
is witness protection, Iris.

07:04.809 --> 07:06.777
We all know how that went.

07:08.277 --> 07:10.610
I just need a kind world.

07:12.176 --> 07:14.443
Well, those don't exist.

07:15.410 --> 07:16.543
And all you're doing is

07:16.643 --> 07:19.042
prolonging the inevitable here, Iris.

07:20.876 --> 07:22.277
Kingstown is not a city.

07:22.842 --> 07:26.743
<i>It's a town and nothing
stays hidden in a town.</i>

07:27.909 --> 07:33.277
So either you leave
or he's gonna find you, period.

07:37.076 --> 07:39.076
Yeah, same goes for you.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.377
Shit. Okay. You thirsty?

08:33.477 --> 08:34.643
No.

08:41.876 --> 08:43.277
Hi.

08:43.543 --> 08:44.677
Hi.

08:45.709 --> 08:47.109
Uh, Mike.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.176
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:50.277 --> 08:52.277
Uh, can I get a word
with you, please?

08:52.277 --> 08:53.942
Go... Yeah. Sit inside.

08:54.510 --> 08:56.610
- Come on.
- Yeah.

08:56.709 --> 08:59.109
Who the fuck is that?

08:59.277 --> 09:02.277
It's the girl from my office
with the three feds

09:02.277 --> 09:03.842
who were murdered.

09:05.042 --> 09:07.310
- Oh. Shit.
- Yeah.

09:10.610 --> 09:13.009
I didn't know we found her.

09:13.377 --> 09:14.876
We didn't. I did.

09:15.310 --> 09:17.009
Look, good for you,

09:17.109 --> 09:19.142
then go hide her
at your fucking cabin.

09:19.277 --> 09:21.310
I can't.
I cannot leave her alone.

09:21.410 --> 09:25.909
All right. She's been put
through the wringer by Milo.

09:26.009 --> 09:28.277
Okay, look, and I put her
in WitPro and she jumped it.

09:28.277 --> 09:29.842
I don't give a shit.

09:29.942 --> 09:31.809
I can't have her here, Mike,

09:31.909 --> 09:34.009
you know, with my pregnant wife
and our mother.

09:34.109 --> 09:35.310
<i>Are you out
of your fucking mind?</i>

09:35.410 --> 09:37.009
I just gotta put a lid
on a fucking problem.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.277
Okay. It's just for a few hours.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.109
Problems don't get bigger
than the hooker

09:40.277 --> 09:41.909
<i>in our mother's
living room, Mike.</i>

09:42.009 --> 09:43.343
- Come on...
- <i>Michael?</i>

09:43.709 --> 09:45.009
Fuck. Asshole.

09:45.109 --> 09:46.543
<i>Yeah.</i>

09:48.277 --> 09:49.909
Sorry it's so late.

09:50.009 --> 09:52.076
We're just looking
for a place to...

09:52.543 --> 09:55.176
- Wait, wait.
- Let me go. Let me...

09:55.277 --> 09:56.809
What the fuck?

09:56.909 --> 09:59.109
- Let me fucking go, Mike!
- Woah, easy. Easy. Easy.

09:59.277 --> 10:00.742
Let me go. You're a fucking dog.

10:00.842 --> 10:01.909
Looking for a safe place...

10:02.477 --> 10:04.310
- <i>Let me go! Let me go.</i>
- What is happening?

10:04.642 --> 10:06.709
- <i>Huh!</i>
- We have a guest.

10:07.510 --> 10:11.243
Um, we have
a spare room upstairs.

10:11.343 --> 10:13.510
Tracy, would you show her
where it is?

10:13.609 --> 10:15.377
- Sure. All right.
- Thank you.

10:15.477 --> 10:17.477
It's just for a minute.
Sorry, guys.

10:18.909 --> 10:21.142
- Hi, I'm Tracy.
- I'm Iris.

10:21.243 --> 10:22.410
<i>That's a pretty name.</i>

10:22.510 --> 10:24.076
<i>It's not mine.
I made it up.</i>

10:24.176 --> 10:25.676
She in trouble?

10:26.709 --> 10:28.477
Yeah. Yes, Mom.

10:29.042 --> 10:31.042
- <i>What kind of trouble?</i>
- The worst kind.

10:31.142 --> 10:33.709
And none of it is her fault.

10:35.510 --> 10:36.876
Okay.

10:38.709 --> 10:40.642
When you coming back
for her, Mike?

10:40.742 --> 10:44.709
This afternoon, this evening.
And I'll get this done.

10:44.809 --> 10:46.277
Okay, well,
the sooner the better.

10:46.377 --> 10:47.443
- Yeah.
-'Cause I don't need

10:47.543 --> 10:48.676
her trouble
to become our trouble.

10:48.776 --> 10:51.343
Yeah, it's kind of already is,
isn't it.

10:51.443 --> 10:53.243
Well, you know, fuck,
I love you,

10:53.343 --> 10:54.642
but, you know, God damn.

10:54.742 --> 10:57.477
- I know. Go to bed.
- <i>Fuck.</i>

11:19.676 --> 11:22.776
Mike, it's a fucking mess.
It's just a fucking mess.

11:23.609 --> 11:25.510
We give your boy a pass
and this is how he treats us.

11:25.609 --> 11:27.742
No, no, no. Fucking bunny
didn't order this shit.

11:28.277 --> 11:29.676
This came from the inside. Jesus.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.776
Thought there were no
fucking leaders on the inside.

11:31.876 --> 11:32.709
There aren't.

11:32.809 --> 11:34.343
That makes
no fucking sense.

11:34.443 --> 11:37.343
Look, when there's
no leaders inside,

11:37.443 --> 11:39.542
everyone tries
to play leader, okay?

11:39.942 --> 11:42.076
Jesus Christ, Ian.

11:42.909 --> 11:45.109
Tail's wagging the fucking dog, right?

11:45.277 --> 11:47.343
And this is the result. Jesus.

11:47.443 --> 11:49.277
It's rough in there, Mike.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.277
I've seen it before.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.776
No, you haven't
seen this, Mike.

12:01.609 --> 12:04.909
No, don't throw up
on my crime scene, come on.

12:05.009 --> 12:06.742
Outside!

12:10.410 --> 12:12.042
Fuck.

12:13.576 --> 12:16.509
So, Mikey, you ever seen
anything like this before?

12:16.609 --> 12:18.410
Because I sure as hell haven't.

12:19.377 --> 12:21.676
No, not like this.

12:21.776 --> 12:23.509
DA's calling it
a mass shooting, Mike.

12:23.609 --> 12:26.277
Well, it's a gang shooting.
He knows it. We know it.

12:26.277 --> 12:27.776
Jesus.

12:28.277 --> 12:29.842
Well, yeah,
it was a gang shooting

12:29.942 --> 12:32.277
when they drove by and hosed
the fucking house down.

12:32.277 --> 12:34.509
When that next group
walked through,

12:34.809 --> 12:36.542
Mikey, fucking executing people,

12:36.642 --> 12:40.576
it became...
It became something else.

12:43.277 --> 12:45.109
Welcome to national news.

12:45.909 --> 12:48.277
- Sir.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

12:48.277 --> 12:50.009
We got a murder weapon.

12:59.410 --> 13:02.042
<i>Am I the only motherfucker</i>
that called this in?

13:02.142 --> 13:04.277
Mikey, Dispatch was on with one
of the vics when she was shot.

13:04.277 --> 13:07.476
He told the patrol units
to fucking seal off the streets

13:07.576 --> 13:09.076
before they pushed
on the goddamn house.

13:09.176 --> 13:11.509
Fearless fucking police chief.
What can we say?

13:11.609 --> 13:12.842
Yeah, we engaged them over here.

13:12.942 --> 13:14.542
- All right, let's see.
- I'll show you.

13:19.542 --> 13:22.277
So we pulled up the house.
They were coming out here.

13:22.742 --> 13:25.142
We engaged and they unleashed
fucking hell on us.

13:25.277 --> 13:26.343
Fuck.

13:26.442 --> 13:28.277
Dipped down this alleyway
and took off.

13:28.277 --> 13:30.709
But one of them dropped this.

13:34.609 --> 13:36.310
<i>That's not
a fucking gangster gun.</i>

13:36.409 --> 13:37.642
<i>Look at this thing.</i>

13:37.742 --> 13:39.642
Mikey, this thing's
got an added rail system.

13:39.742 --> 13:43.310
It's got... It's got
a fucking muzzle brake on it.

13:43.642 --> 13:45.742
Great, now they're
fucking gunsmiths now.

13:45.842 --> 13:47.676
No, they don't know
how to do that shit

13:47.776 --> 13:49.277
unless they got it
from the Mexicans.

13:49.277 --> 13:50.476
You case this alley yet?

13:50.576 --> 13:52.042
No, sir, they told us
to wait for SWAT.

13:52.142 --> 13:53.409
- You got a torch?
- Yeah.

13:54.809 --> 13:55.609
Yeah.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.742
Follow this right here.

14:01.642 --> 14:03.976
Fuck, Mikey, maybe we should
wait for SWAT.

14:04.076 --> 14:05.742
Well, if we wait
for this guy to bleed out,

14:05.842 --> 14:07.376
we're not gonna know
more than we already know.

14:07.476 --> 14:09.109
And we don't know fucking shit.

14:16.176 --> 14:17.642
Jesus, he's right there.

14:25.109 --> 14:27.109
My name's Mike McLusky.

14:28.277 --> 14:29.676
You know who I am?

14:33.277 --> 14:34.509
<i>You know my name?</i>

14:34.776 --> 14:36.542
I know who you are.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.609
Can I come over and talk to you

14:38.876 --> 14:40.809
and you not fucking shoot me?

14:41.409 --> 14:43.109
<i>I can't shoot you, man.</i>

14:43.542 --> 14:44.976
Dropped my gun.

14:46.809 --> 14:48.642
All right, I'm coming over.

15:05.009 --> 15:08.009
They start shooting
and we start shooting.

15:08.676 --> 15:13.676
We run, and my fucking stomach
just opened up

15:13.776 --> 15:15.809
<i>and everything
trying to fall out.</i>

15:18.277 --> 15:20.476
Yeah, a ricochet
off the asphalt.

15:20.576 --> 15:22.776
Sliced you as it goes by.

15:23.542 --> 15:24.909
<i>I'm fucked then.</i>

15:27.277 --> 15:29.109
Yeah, you're fucked anyway.

15:30.277 --> 15:33.176
There's two dozen dead people
next door.

15:34.376 --> 15:36.109
<i>All right.</i>

15:37.676 --> 15:41.009
Everything's gone so south, man.

15:43.309 --> 15:46.309
I didn't count on
motherfuckers doing drive-bys

15:46.409 --> 15:48.276
on bus stops.

15:49.442 --> 15:52.509
<i>Fucking shooting
people's grandmas and shit.</i>

15:53.009 --> 15:54.042
That's how they wanna play,

15:54.142 --> 15:56.576
then we gonna
motherfucking play.

15:57.709 --> 15:59.442
They gonna hit
motherfucking churches next.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.142
Is that right?
Then what they gonna do?

16:01.276 --> 16:03.476
I'm gonna tell you
what they're gonna fucking do.

16:03.576 --> 16:04.909
They'll hit the schools

16:05.009 --> 16:06.709
and then they'll find out
where your fucking mother works.

16:06.809 --> 16:09.442
This only goes one way
until it stops, okay?

16:09.542 --> 16:11.709
It's a lose fucking lose
for everybody.

16:11.809 --> 16:13.509
<i>Ain't no way
to make it stop, man.</i>

16:13.609 --> 16:14.909
Head been cut off
all the chickens

16:15.009 --> 16:18.176
and they just running around,
bleeding everywhere.

16:19.076 --> 16:22.109
So you all paired up
with Mexicans, did ya?

16:24.009 --> 16:26.042
Bloods tied up with the Aryans.

16:27.376 --> 16:29.876
- I ain't telling you shit.
- <i>Oh, is that right?</i>

16:29.976 --> 16:32.176
You've been saying shit to me
since I walked over.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.276
<i>Why don't you say
some shit to me</i>

16:34.276 --> 16:35.609
that fucking makes a difference?

16:35.709 --> 16:37.609
Will you get the fuck out
of here, for God sakes, Stevie.

16:37.709 --> 16:39.276
Come on,
how about it?

16:39.776 --> 16:41.809
Say something
that makes a fucking difference.

16:43.842 --> 16:46.109
They fucking killed my sister
at that bus stop.

16:47.276 --> 16:50.376
Eight years old.
Not a gangbanger in sight.

16:51.276 --> 16:52.976
I understand.

16:54.276 --> 16:58.109
And you think what you just did
in there is gonna stop it?

16:58.842 --> 17:02.976
Huh? Until the chickens
get their fucking heads,

17:04.409 --> 17:08.042
every fucking bus stop,
every mall, everywhere,

17:08.442 --> 17:10.642
just like this. You understand?

17:10.742 --> 17:12.342
No one can leave their house.

17:14.676 --> 17:16.409
I'm dying, man.

17:17.276 --> 17:18.676
Yes, you are.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.276
You ain't wrong.

17:26.276 --> 17:29.309
Who you said is with who,
you ain't wrong.

17:31.976 --> 17:34.276
Hey. Who ordered this?

17:35.676 --> 17:37.076
Look at me. Who ordered this?

17:39.709 --> 17:42.509
Nobody, man.
That's the fucking problem.

17:43.142 --> 17:44.776
<i>Ain't nobody ordering nothing.</i>

17:44.876 --> 17:48.409
Motherfuckers just out here
warring and shit.

17:50.442 --> 17:53.776
Just... Just warring, man.

18:10.809 --> 18:12.409
I'm gonna go
talk to Bunny.

18:12.509 --> 18:15.509
Mike, you gotta get him
to find the fucking off switch.

18:15.609 --> 18:17.609
This town's gonna get
locked down.

18:17.709 --> 18:20.642
If somebody was
gonna shut it down, Ian,

18:20.742 --> 18:22.276
they would've done it already.

18:22.509 --> 18:24.442
<i>This place don't lock down.</i>

18:42.776 --> 18:44.276
Hey.

18:49.509 --> 18:51.175
Are you all right?

18:51.609 --> 18:53.276
What's goin' on?

18:58.376 --> 19:00.509
This fucking job, Mike.

19:03.542 --> 19:05.042
I swear to God...

19:06.175 --> 19:07.576
I know.

19:08.809 --> 19:10.409
I know.

19:12.009 --> 19:15.409
And people wonder
why I don't have a boyfriend.

19:21.476 --> 19:24.276
No, I get why.

19:26.108 --> 19:31.075
I mean, you're single because
you're smarter than everybody.

19:32.108 --> 19:33.542
And you let everybody know it.

19:36.909 --> 19:41.141
You see? And you laugh
when you get insulted.

19:41.276 --> 19:43.342
And you feel insulted
'cause you laugh.

19:43.442 --> 19:46.075
Fucking complicated. You're
a fucking pain in the ass.

19:47.542 --> 19:50.276
Hey, come on. Cheer up, okay?

19:51.942 --> 19:53.809
Look at me.

19:56.409 --> 19:59.075
If it was easy,
everyone would do it, okay?

19:59.509 --> 20:00.876
You're a boss.

20:01.208 --> 20:02.476
Come on.

20:02.909 --> 20:04.342
You know
you're single too, Mike?

20:04.442 --> 20:07.276
Yeah, for very different
fucking reasons.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.141
Bunny.

20:55.175 --> 20:58.409
<i>Yo, you know who it is.
Leave a message.</i>

20:58.876 --> 21:00.309
Bunny!

21:06.909 --> 21:09.276
Bunny! You motherfucker!

21:20.809 --> 21:22.342
What the fuck?

21:25.576 --> 21:26.975
<i>Hey.</i>

21:32.609 --> 21:34.342
Hey.
He here?

21:39.642 --> 21:42.876
Yeah, just be ready.

21:46.908 --> 21:48.442
Mike, this shit
getting out of hand.

21:48.542 --> 21:49.908
Yeah, you think?

21:50.008 --> 21:51.908
What the fuck did I
just walk into on 23rd Street?

21:52.008 --> 21:53.075
What the fuck did you do?

21:53.175 --> 21:54.676
It was a fucking massacre
under your flag!

21:54.776 --> 21:56.175
- No, not my flag. No.
- Yeah?

21:56.276 --> 21:58.908
I did not call that.
No. I can't.

21:59.008 --> 22:00.809
I can't call that.
That shit came from inside.

22:00.908 --> 22:02.309
I talked
to the shooter, all right?

22:02.409 --> 22:03.975
It did not come
from the fucking inside,

22:04.075 --> 22:05.309
so unless it came from you,

22:05.409 --> 22:06.776
somebody's fucking cooking
something up.

22:06.876 --> 22:08.409
- It's the fucking guards!
- Oh, come on.

22:08.509 --> 22:10.876
Them motherfuckers
giving us their backs.

22:10.975 --> 22:12.141
They shank a fool in the back,

22:12.276 --> 22:13.776
leave the body
in the cot to rot.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.609
They throwing motherfuckers out
with the fucking trash, Mike.

22:16.709 --> 22:18.609
Listen to me. Two things.

22:18.709 --> 22:20.742
You gotta sit everyone down
on the outside.

22:20.842 --> 22:22.642
Okay, then you all
have to agree

22:22.742 --> 22:24.609
that none of your ships
have fucking captains,

22:24.709 --> 22:26.975
and until they do, no ships
leave the fucking port.

22:27.075 --> 22:28.108
You understand the metaphor?

22:28.276 --> 22:29.576
What about the fucking guards, man?

22:29.676 --> 22:30.809
I'll handle the fucking guards.

22:30.908 --> 22:32.276
Yeah, we need some order
on the inside, cuz.

22:32.276 --> 22:35.409
Them motherfucking guards
need to sit their ass down too.

22:36.342 --> 22:38.542
It takes time to find a leader.

22:38.642 --> 22:39.809
- And right now...
- Yeah.

22:39.908 --> 22:41.075
A leader tries to rise,

22:41.175 --> 22:42.776
and that motherfucker is dead
by nightfall.

22:42.875 --> 22:44.576
Okay, look, I'll get
the fucking guards

22:44.676 --> 22:45.842
to take their blinders off.

22:45.941 --> 22:48.075
You gotta manage this truce
like fucking now

22:48.175 --> 22:50.075
'cause the National Guard
is gonna start

22:50.175 --> 22:51.276
patrolling these streets.

22:51.376 --> 22:52.709
And we've seen
how they handle shit.

22:54.108 --> 22:57.841
You... You gonna need
to referee this shit.

22:57.941 --> 23:00.609
Fuck I do.
I ain't refereeing shit.

23:00.709 --> 23:01.941
You out of your mind?

23:02.041 --> 23:03.442
How the fuck we gonna have four
motherfucking enemies

23:03.542 --> 23:04.542
sit their ass down

23:04.642 --> 23:06.376
and not kill each other
without a Sweden?

23:07.609 --> 23:08.975
What, a Switzerland?

23:09.075 --> 23:10.776
I'm not fucking Switzerland.
Fuck that.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.075
Man, kiss my ass, man.

23:12.175 --> 23:13.676
Sweden, Switzerland, crackerland,

23:13.776 --> 23:14.908
whatever cracker-ass country

23:15.008 --> 23:16.442
babysitting the other
cracker-ass country

23:16.542 --> 23:18.442
when y'all motherfuckers
be blowing shit up.

23:18.542 --> 23:19.542
That.

23:19.642 --> 23:21.908
We need a mediator, Mike.

23:22.008 --> 23:24.276
Otherwise, all this shit
is gonna do

23:24.376 --> 23:26.409
is make this war worse.

23:26.509 --> 23:28.476
- Fuck.
- You saw that shit.

23:33.509 --> 23:34.709
Okay.

23:34.808 --> 23:36.776
Okay, okay.

23:41.509 --> 23:42.776
I have an idea.

23:43.276 --> 23:44.376
I'm right here, man.
Hit me with it.

23:44.476 --> 23:45.776
All right, you're gonna have to

23:45.875 --> 23:47.376
really fucking trust me
on this one, though, Bunny,

23:47.476 --> 23:50.008
and I mean really
fucking trust me, okay?

23:50.841 --> 23:52.841
It's gonna sting,
but it will work.

23:53.709 --> 23:55.509
And I promise
I will keep my word to you.

23:55.609 --> 23:57.276
- How bad it's gonna sting?
- Oh, like a motherfucker.

23:57.276 --> 23:59.041
And when it's over,

24:00.342 --> 24:02.775
you won't have to hide out
in this fucking rooftop anymore.

24:02.875 --> 24:03.975
Okay?

24:04.609 --> 24:07.442
I spent my whole life
in this sorry-ass motherfucker.

24:07.542 --> 24:10.576
Every time, somehow,
this bitch get worse.

24:11.542 --> 24:13.941
<i>And just when you think it can't
get any worse than it is,</i>

24:14.041 --> 24:16.276
man, this motherfucker
find a way.

24:17.141 --> 24:18.642
Yeah.

24:23.276 --> 24:24.642
I'ma trust you on this.

24:24.742 --> 24:26.409
Yeah. All right.

24:26.509 --> 24:27.442
Good.

24:27.542 --> 24:28.609
Now I'll see you in three hours.

24:28.709 --> 24:30.075
All right, all right,
all right, do it.

24:30.175 --> 24:31.309
- Three hours, okay?
- <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

24:31.409 --> 24:33.576
Don't be late.
Don't bring a fucking army.

24:33.676 --> 24:35.875
And just keep people here
for the status quo.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.509
Three hours, okay?

24:57.075 --> 24:58.276
Yeah.

24:58.276 --> 25:01.908
Hey, it's me. You awake?
I have an idea.

25:02.376 --> 25:05.376
<i>Two Xanax,
three whiskeys.</i>

25:07.941 --> 25:09.108
What's your idea?

25:09.609 --> 25:12.376
What if I could get you
the leaders to all four gangs?

25:12.941 --> 25:15.676
Everyone that's at war. What if
I can give them all to you?

25:19.841 --> 25:21.309
What's it gonna cost me?

25:21.409 --> 25:23.875
<i>Well, I need them
in the pen, not county.</i>

25:25.276 --> 25:26.775
They on parole?

25:26.875 --> 25:27.941
Two of them are.

25:28.041 --> 25:29.875
One isn't. The other one,
I don't know.

25:30.141 --> 25:31.741
<i>What's the charge?</i>

25:32.309 --> 25:33.908
Found in possession of firearm.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.309
- That's 10 years, Mike.
- <i>Yes, it is.</i>

25:36.409 --> 25:38.376
But here's the catch, Evelyn.

25:38.476 --> 25:40.875
I'm gonna need you
to drop all the charges.

25:43.409 --> 25:45.008
Why charge them at all, Mike?

25:45.108 --> 25:46.775
Because I need them
on the inside

25:46.875 --> 25:48.409
to pick new leaders, that's why.

25:48.509 --> 25:50.309
You want me to arrest
the leaders

25:50.409 --> 25:52.276
of the four worst prison gangs

25:52.276 --> 25:55.309
so they can reinstate
a leadership structure

25:55.409 --> 25:56.775
inside the prison?

25:56.875 --> 25:58.276
Exactly.

25:58.376 --> 25:59.642
You have any idea how fucking
insane that sounds, Mike?

25:59.741 --> 26:01.741
Evelyn, you,
more than anybody, knows

26:01.841 --> 26:03.476
that the inside
runs the outside, okay.

26:03.576 --> 26:05.841
Nobody right now
is running the inside.

26:06.775 --> 26:08.141
<i>Look, unless you want
to keep meeting</i>

26:08.276 --> 26:09.609
<i>over the body
of a 16-year-old girl</i>

26:09.708 --> 26:12.276
<i>waiting for her boyfriend
at a bus stop.</i>

26:13.276 --> 26:14.309
I just don't see it.

26:14.409 --> 26:17.276
Well, I do, okay? I see it.

26:17.276 --> 26:18.775
So you gotta trust me.

26:22.875 --> 26:23.941
Okay.

26:24.641 --> 26:25.975
All right, look,
this is gonna happen soon,

26:26.075 --> 26:27.675
so be ready. I'll call you.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.309
Hey. Congratulations.

26:52.041 --> 26:53.841
What the fuck, Mike!

26:54.476 --> 26:55.509
The fuck, what?

26:55.608 --> 26:57.509
I don't need you
sneaking up on me.

26:57.608 --> 26:58.808
What?

26:58.908 --> 27:01.075
I just walked up the middle
of your fucking driveway.

27:01.175 --> 27:03.542
The door's wide open. Chill out.

27:06.108 --> 27:07.608
The fuck you doing here?

27:08.276 --> 27:09.975
I heard they gave you
the prison.

27:10.075 --> 27:11.476
Well, when wardens
lose the prison,

27:11.576 --> 27:13.509
they lose their jobs,
it's temporary.

27:16.276 --> 27:17.575
Something I need to show you.

27:19.875 --> 27:21.276
Show me what?

27:21.276 --> 27:23.941
It has an immediate impact
on your new position.

27:24.041 --> 27:25.542
Okay, what's the play?

27:27.008 --> 27:29.041
We need new leaders in Tent City

27:29.141 --> 27:30.641
and we need to pick them.

27:32.141 --> 27:33.875
Only order in Tent City is mine.

27:33.975 --> 27:35.041
Why fuck with that?

27:35.141 --> 27:36.376
'Cause we need order
on the inside

27:36.476 --> 27:38.075
to get order
on the outside. That's why.

27:38.175 --> 27:39.509
Fucking let them
kill each other.

27:39.608 --> 27:41.941
This shit has already
spilled out on the street

27:42.041 --> 27:43.442
in a real fucking way, okay,

27:43.542 --> 27:44.975
<i>and it's only
a matter of time</i>

27:45.075 --> 27:47.442
<i>before they start hosing
down your kids' fucking schools,</i>

27:47.741 --> 27:50.175
the playgrounds,
the churches, right?

27:50.276 --> 27:51.841
We don't want that.

27:54.376 --> 27:55.841
Do I need a weapon?

27:56.509 --> 27:58.509
Fuck, I have one.

27:59.075 --> 28:00.941
Let me change and get my pistol.

28:01.575 --> 28:03.708
Oh, hey, who do you got
as your second, by the way?

28:04.008 --> 28:05.376
Carney.

28:05.975 --> 28:06.975
Fuck, really?

28:07.808 --> 28:09.409
Are you sure he's got
the right attitude for the job?

28:09.509 --> 28:12.476
Yeah, he's got the only attitude
that survives this job.

28:12.575 --> 28:15.509
No, you fucking survived, Kareem.

28:16.309 --> 28:18.175
I lived.
I wouldn't say I survived.

28:18.608 --> 28:19.908
- I'll meet you in the car.
- All right.

28:49.808 --> 28:51.908
<i>You talking to anybody?</i>

28:52.875 --> 28:54.041
About what?

29:00.541 --> 29:02.975
Who the fuck am I gonna talk to?

29:04.975 --> 29:07.941
Who do you talk to for all
the shit you been through?

29:09.141 --> 29:10.541
Ah, I don't talk
to anybody, man.

29:10.641 --> 29:14.075
It's, uh...
I got nothing to lose.

29:19.741 --> 29:22.008
Who does your brother talk to?

29:23.342 --> 29:25.108
I don't know. Probably his wife.

29:27.276 --> 29:29.108
The fuck he does.

29:29.675 --> 29:31.808
Yeah, the fuck he does, right.

29:44.441 --> 29:45.875
Hi.

29:52.608 --> 29:53.908
You should blend in, Robert.

29:54.008 --> 29:55.808
Yeah, it's about as
plain clothes as I get, brother.

29:55.908 --> 29:57.508
- Yeah.
- Stevie's on the roof.

29:57.608 --> 29:59.675
My boys are in that warehouse.
I'm wired into them.

30:00.309 --> 30:03.541
Hey, do you think they have
spies looking out for PD

30:03.641 --> 30:04.941
set on the street?

30:05.041 --> 30:06.641
We already made their spies.
You know me, Mike.

30:06.741 --> 30:08.276
Early bird
gets the fucking worm.

30:08.376 --> 30:09.608
Everything's in place, man.

30:09.708 --> 30:11.508
What are you dragging me into?

30:11.608 --> 30:13.808
You're about to give your word
and you will keep it.

30:16.508 --> 30:18.041
<i>This fucking guy.</i>

30:18.141 --> 30:19.541
What the fuck are you doing?

30:19.641 --> 30:21.376
I ain't trying to fight fair
with these pieces of shit.

30:21.475 --> 30:24.975
Well, we're not fighting at all.
How about that?

30:25.408 --> 30:28.175
Okay? Keep it down.

30:34.008 --> 30:35.475
Do not fucking move!

30:35.808 --> 30:37.441
Put your hands
on the roof.

30:38.008 --> 30:39.276
Down, man.

30:39.808 --> 30:42.075
Escalade, close
the fucking door.

30:42.175 --> 30:43.808
<i>Hands on the car.</i>

30:44.541 --> 30:46.541
Mercedes, pop the trunk.

30:47.908 --> 30:50.075
<i>Walk around the vehicle
to my side.</i>

30:50.175 --> 30:51.908
Put your hands on the hood.

30:52.975 --> 30:55.975
<i>Chop, chop,
motherfucker, let's go.</i>

31:14.508 --> 31:15.808
Stay.

31:24.508 --> 31:25.975
Out.

31:29.775 --> 31:32.975
I'm a king, baby.
King don't need no sword.

31:33.075 --> 31:34.175
If you were the king,

31:34.276 --> 31:36.541
there would be no need
for this fucking meeting.

31:43.341 --> 31:45.741
You and only you
walk over there.

31:48.108 --> 31:50.276
You, fuckheads,
back in the vehicle.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.875
Park across the lot,
facing me.

31:51.975 --> 31:54.276
<i>Do not drive back
until I wave you over.</i>

31:54.276 --> 31:56.775
- Bunny.
- What do we got here?

31:57.375 --> 31:59.708
Woah, angry little peckerwood.

32:01.608 --> 32:03.308
And Uncle Tom.

32:03.641 --> 32:04.741
Good to see you, man.
Thanks for coming.

32:04.841 --> 32:06.941
My man,
what's good, baby?

32:11.641 --> 32:13.541
How you feeling?
You walking straight yet?

32:13.641 --> 32:15.608
How about I toss you
in the fucking bay

32:15.708 --> 32:17.075
and see if your fat ass
can swim?

32:17.175 --> 32:19.341
Shit, you could try.
I'm right here, baby.

32:19.441 --> 32:20.875
- Let's go.
- Keep talking, thug life.

32:20.975 --> 32:23.475
Let's see how far up your ass
I can get the barrel of my gun.

32:23.575 --> 32:24.741
- Hey. Come on, guys.
- Stop!

32:24.841 --> 32:26.141
Is this how
we keep the fucking peace?

32:26.275 --> 32:27.808
Fucking put that away,
would you, please,

32:27.908 --> 32:29.275
<i>like in the fucking truck.</i>

32:29.375 --> 32:31.675
- You. Out, out. Only you.
- Don't hurt yourself.

32:40.808 --> 32:42.908
You nosepickers,
park across the lot, facing me.

32:43.008 --> 32:45.141
Do not drive back
until I wave you over.

32:48.408 --> 32:50.008
That's good.

32:51.075 --> 32:52.275
Mike.

32:53.608 --> 32:56.108
- I don't know you.
- I'm in from Grand Rapids.

32:56.941 --> 32:58.641
We don't have anyone
in Kingstown

32:58.741 --> 33:01.041
ready to represent us
in something like this.

33:01.141 --> 33:02.741
How do I know
your people in Kingstown

33:02.841 --> 33:04.341
- gonna do what you say?
- <i>Stop.</i>

33:04.441 --> 33:07.175
When they don't do what I say,
they stop being my people.

33:07.275 --> 33:09.308
<i>Hands on the wheel
where I can see them.</i>

33:09.908 --> 33:12.308
<i>All right.
Gang's all here.</i>

33:16.775 --> 33:19.841
<i>Mexicans and the Bloods,
hand-in-hand.</i>

33:23.275 --> 33:24.441
How you living, brother?

33:24.541 --> 33:26.375
- Oh, we're brothers today?
- Yeah.

33:26.475 --> 33:28.675
We gonna try, huh.

33:32.841 --> 33:35.508
Man, why you bring that
crazy-ass motherfucker here?

33:36.275 --> 33:40.275
He's here to ensure that the
bitter pill goes down smoothly.

33:40.641 --> 33:43.541
All right, any truce,
any agreement,

33:43.641 --> 33:45.508
anything that we come up with
out here,

33:45.808 --> 33:47.908
has to be enforced inside, okay?

33:48.008 --> 33:50.375
Otherwise, it doesn't mean
fucking dick-all.

33:50.475 --> 33:52.408
Right? So we can
agree upon this.

33:52.508 --> 33:56.375
The interim warden will patrol
the prison again, okay?

33:56.475 --> 34:00.275
And they will intervene
with any and all conflicts.

34:00.275 --> 34:01.708
What about food?

34:01.808 --> 34:03.541
You know what they feed
the motherfuckers in there?

34:03.641 --> 34:06.741
All inmate work programs
have been suspended.

34:06.841 --> 34:08.875
All food is outsourced.

34:08.975 --> 34:11.508
We don't have a kitchen
or refrigeration,

34:11.608 --> 34:14.041
so until we can move
inmates inside,

34:14.141 --> 34:16.275
bagged meals
is the best we can do.

34:16.275 --> 34:17.641
That's the price of riot.

34:17.741 --> 34:19.008
So what about
the witch hunts, huh?

34:19.108 --> 34:20.608
Y'all guards
got all the payback yet

34:20.708 --> 34:22.275
or y'all still got
a little rape left in you?

34:22.275 --> 34:24.108
No, I got some
left in me, motherfucker.

34:24.275 --> 34:25.741
Hey, hey,
what the fuck did I say?

34:25.841 --> 34:27.275
What the fuck did I say?

34:33.275 --> 34:34.475
What the fuck is this?

34:34.575 --> 34:37.174
This is
the assistant district attorney.

34:38.408 --> 34:40.275
I know. What does she
have to do with this?

34:40.375 --> 34:41.775
She's going to be giving you

34:41.875 --> 34:43.341
the pill
you're going to swallow.

34:51.140 --> 34:53.641
This is to keep everybody calm.

34:54.375 --> 34:56.741
<i>Any sudden move
will be considered a threat.</i>

34:57.041 --> 34:58.174
<i>And we've all met before</i>

34:58.275 --> 35:00.341
so you know
how I deal with a threat.

35:00.841 --> 35:02.107
<i>You're being placed
under arrest</i>

35:02.275 --> 35:04.508
<i>for felonies
of possession of firearms.</i>

35:04.608 --> 35:06.808
And when there's peace
in the motherfucking valley,

35:06.908 --> 35:09.075
charges against you
will be dropped.

35:10.475 --> 35:13.174
For you, that means peace
in the valley for everyone.

35:13.541 --> 35:14.741
<i>Okay?</i>

35:15.107 --> 35:16.375
<i>So how long
they gonna hold us?</i>

35:17.075 --> 35:18.140
How <i>long will it take you</i>

35:18.275 --> 35:20.075
<i>to get your house
together inside?</i>

35:21.675 --> 35:22.641
Not long.

35:22.741 --> 35:23.775
Wouldn't take me long either.

35:23.875 --> 35:25.675
Ice cold, Mike.

35:25.775 --> 35:27.908
Name another way, Bunny.
Name another way.

35:28.508 --> 35:30.508
Lay on your stomach
with your arms out stretched

35:30.608 --> 35:32.775
to the side and your thumbs up.

35:33.275 --> 35:35.841
No, no, no, you stay
where the fuck you are, Mike.

35:35.941 --> 35:38.041
Motherfucker,
you stay and watch.

35:38.140 --> 35:39.508
Just get it done, Bunny.
Come on.

35:46.375 --> 35:49.341
Come on, boys. Come on.

35:55.140 --> 35:56.441
Fuck you!

36:06.608 --> 36:08.074
Hi, Mom.

36:08.708 --> 36:09.975
Michael.

36:21.708 --> 36:23.140
Hey.

36:26.875 --> 36:28.275
Fuck.

36:30.275 --> 36:32.475
Jesus, Mom.
What the fuck?

36:33.275 --> 36:34.408
- She's gone.
- Gone?

36:34.508 --> 36:36.875
She's not in her fucking room.
She's gone.

36:37.808 --> 36:39.541
God damn it.

36:50.575 --> 36:52.975
It's going 25 in a 45.

36:53.441 --> 36:57.275
Yeah, uphill, towing a boat
with a fucking Jeep Cherokee.

36:57.808 --> 36:59.441
Just pass him.

37:01.541 --> 37:03.341
Come on. Really?

37:03.808 --> 37:05.275
Yeah.

37:06.275 --> 37:07.408
Yeah?

37:12.741 --> 37:15.040
Driver, pull to the shoulder
and stop your vehicle.

37:17.140 --> 37:20.508
Yeah. Yeah, you, pull over
and stop your vehicle.

37:22.275 --> 37:23.541
Fuck.

37:34.074 --> 37:36.341
Fucking asshole.

37:37.341 --> 37:39.275
What did you call me?

37:39.375 --> 37:40.741
A fucking asshole.

37:40.841 --> 37:42.275
The guy's pulling a boat, uphill,

37:42.275 --> 37:43.974
you tailgate him,
hit him with the sirens,

37:44.074 --> 37:46.107
he pushes that shit
to the speed limit,

37:46.275 --> 37:48.007
and then you pull him over?
You're a fucking asshole.

37:48.107 --> 37:49.441
Lights don't mean speed up, Einstein.

37:49.541 --> 37:51.675
They mean pull over
and get the fuck out of my way.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.608
Fine, but if we're going
to do this,

37:53.708 --> 37:54.974
let me do it right.

37:55.074 --> 37:56.575
Okay, this is not a goddamn
prison riot, okay?

37:56.675 --> 37:58.675
This is just a DUI. Settle down.

37:58.775 --> 38:00.575
I need to run his plate.
God damn it.

38:00.675 --> 38:03.074
Can't wait to see how much this
nitwit drank on the lake today.

38:03.174 --> 38:06.675
Morass, wait till I
get into position. Wait.

38:07.308 --> 38:08.908
Sir, do you know
why I pulled you over?

38:17.441 --> 38:20.508
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

38:23.675 --> 38:26.140
Fuck. Morass!

38:31.275 --> 38:32.408
Shit.

38:33.040 --> 38:34.708
Morass!

38:46.841 --> 38:50.441
Uh, Dispatch, it's two... Fuck!

38:50.541 --> 38:52.308
Dispatch, Alpha 217.

38:52.408 --> 38:55.508
I got an officer down.
Multiple GSW.

38:55.608 --> 38:58.940
The assailant is down
and the other one...

38:59.275 --> 39:01.940
I need EMS to my location.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.775
<i>Copy, Alpha 217.
What's your location?</i>

39:04.874 --> 39:08.341
Uh, it's Highway 31,

39:08.441 --> 39:11.408
north of, uh... Fuck.
North of...

39:11.508 --> 39:13.907
<i>I need a mile marker,
Alpha 217.</i>

39:14.007 --> 39:15.808
I don't know!

39:16.174 --> 39:18.275
<i>Use your beacon,
Alpha 217.</i>

39:54.840 --> 39:56.375
Fuck!

39:57.074 --> 39:58.708
Fuck!

42:02.441 --> 42:04.341
I have nowhere to go.

42:15.140 --> 42:16.874
I have no home.

42:25.840 --> 42:27.275
Please?

42:36.308 --> 42:38.275
I have no home.

43:01.774 --> 43:03.740
You're home now.

44:02.140 --> 44:03.840
Hop along.

44:28.508 --> 44:30.774
Yo, fuck off.
Move out his way, yo.

44:49.441 --> 44:52.007
Guess y'all must not
pray to God up in here.

44:53.607 --> 44:54.807
'Cause if you motherfuckers did,

44:54.907 --> 44:56.840
y'all wouldn't be
staring at the devil.

45:18.475 --> 45:20.874
<i>Next time on
Mayor of Kingstown...</i>

45:20.974 --> 45:22.140
She just ran away?

45:22.275 --> 45:23.341
Yeah.

45:23.441 --> 45:24.640
This is your new home.

45:24.740 --> 45:26.840
You know Iris?
She's trouble.

45:26.940 --> 45:29.940
Tell your boss that I know
he's out, I'm gonna find him.

45:30.040 --> 45:31.275
Down on the ground, now!

45:31.375 --> 45:32.441
You know who my grandson is?

45:32.540 --> 45:34.474
I do, ma'am.
Yes, that's why we're here.

45:35.375 --> 45:36.540
It wasn't supposed to happen.

45:36.640 --> 45:38.574
You can't even control
your own people.

45:38.674 --> 45:41.341
You don't attack them
while the leaders are inside

45:41.441 --> 45:42.441
working for us.

45:42.540 --> 45:44.040
There's gonna be payback.
