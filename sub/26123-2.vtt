00:00.036 --> 00:01.384
<i>Previously on The Last Ship</i>

00:01.581 --> 00:03.070
- Do you miss it, sir?
- Miss what?

00:03.200 --> 00:04.067
War.

00:04.094 --> 00:07.295
Gustavo Barros has inspired
all of South America

00:07.301 --> 00:08.264
He's a revolutionary.

00:08.374 --> 00:11.864
<i>Americans, We will no longer
cower in fear of your big stick.</i>

00:12.026 --> 00:13.927
This is a full-scale invasion.

00:13.983 --> 00:16.286
Emergency shut-down.
Shut everything down!

00:16.335 --> 00:17.801
Take cover!

00:18.030 --> 00:20.395
<i>If the United States wants a fight,
you will lose.</i>

00:20.403 --> 00:22.299
The US Navy fleet in Florida
was just attacked.

00:22.301 --> 00:23.437
All the ships were sunk,

00:23.461 --> 00:25.560
but for what comes next,
we're on the front line.

00:25.563 --> 00:26.860
If I'm gonna die,
I'm going down with the ship.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.444
We're at war.

00:29.650 --> 00:31.945
<i>Earlier today,
the United States of America</i>

00:31.955 --> 00:33.415
<i>was suddenly
and without provocation...</i>

00:33.540 --> 00:34.880
Alisha, are you there?

00:34.880 --> 00:35.669
Yeah, honey, I'm here.

00:36.444 --> 00:37.100
I was so worried.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.030
You know, the...
The... the attack.

00:39.030 --> 00:41.370
Y-You didn't say
you were going to Mayport,

00:41.371 --> 00:42.720
and your friends were there.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.190
So I thought maybe you went, and...

00:45.720 --> 00:47.790
Baby, I'm just so happy
to hear your voice.

00:47.790 --> 00:50.590
I'm okay.
Are you all right?

00:50.590 --> 00:52.860
No.
I mean... yeah, yeah.

00:52.860 --> 00:55.060
I-I'm fine.
I'm just freaking out a little.

00:55.070 --> 00:56.870
Those ships...
Are they all gone?

00:56.870 --> 00:58.730
Is there gonna be another attack?

00:58.740 --> 01:00.540
They're not saying
anything new on TV.

01:00.540 --> 01:02.400
Honey, don't watch the TV.

01:02.410 --> 01:03.940
Everything's going to be okay.

01:03.940 --> 01:05.069
I promise.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.140
Look, I... I got to be here
a little while longer,

01:07.140 --> 01:08.880
but I'll call you
as soon as I can, okay?

01:08.880 --> 01:11.280
We got a lot of good people
working hard to keep us safe.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.620
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:13.620 --> 01:16.080
Y-You need to call me soon.

01:16.090 --> 01:19.090
Let me know what's going on. Let
me know you're okay. Promise?

01:19.090 --> 01:21.090
<i>I have therefore
asked the Congress</i>

01:21.090 --> 01:23.030
<i>to declare a State of War</i>

01:23.030 --> 01:28.160
<i>between the United States
and the Gran Colombian Empire.</i>

01:28.160 --> 01:29.230
I promise.

01:29.230 --> 01:30.500
I love you.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.300
Yeah, I love you, too.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.570
<i>Absolute victory.</i>

01:33.570 --> 01:35.700
<i>May God bless
the United States of America.</i>

01:37.510 --> 01:39.110
<i>The President has declared war</i>

01:39.110 --> 01:41.510
<i>against
the Gran Colombian Empire.</i>

01:41.510 --> 01:44.250
Tom.
It's good to see you.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.920
You, too, Joe. No
word from the <i>James.</i>

01:46.920 --> 01:49.580
They won't call until it's safe.

01:49.590 --> 01:52.120
Anything from our team in Panama?

01:52.120 --> 01:54.460
Nothing yet.
But no news is good news.

01:54.460 --> 01:57.060
General. Russ.

01:57.060 --> 01:59.260
- Admiral.
- My Marines?

02:00.600 --> 02:03.730
They're starting a body count.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.740
Doesn't do it justice.

02:07.740 --> 02:10.139
They hit us hard.

02:10.139 --> 02:13.210
Admiral, the reports
are still dribbling in,

02:13.210 --> 02:16.280
but Panama has definitely
thrown in with Gustavo.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.150
Costa Rica and Ecuador
are on the brink.

02:18.150 --> 02:20.080
If a domino effect
starts in the region,

02:20.080 --> 02:21.620
we could be in real trouble.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.890
Gustavo won't stop
south of our border.

02:23.890 --> 02:25.950
How are we supposed to defend
against a second attack

02:25.960 --> 02:27.960
if we don't even know
how the first one happened

02:27.960 --> 02:29.820
or if we can even
recover from it?

02:29.830 --> 02:31.930
I know someone
who can help with that.

02:32.900 --> 02:35.630
A student of mine
at the Academy.

02:35.630 --> 02:36.900
A midshipman?

02:36.900 --> 02:38.500
Clayton Swain.

02:38.500 --> 02:39.970
He saw this attack coming.

02:39.970 --> 02:42.370
Master Chief, we need to find him
and bring him here.

02:42.370 --> 02:43.840
Yes, sir.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.710
We need to deploy
all our available assets.

02:45.710 --> 02:47.710
If it floats, flies,
or rolls, it fights.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.580
Agreed.
We need every piece of intel

02:49.580 --> 02:52.110
we have on Central
and South America...

02:52.120 --> 02:53.580
Air and Naval assets,
troop levels,

02:53.580 --> 02:55.980
- centers of gravity... everything.
- Wait.

02:55.990 --> 02:58.650
Are you talking about
sending our assets south?

02:58.660 --> 03:00.860
We have no command and control.

03:00.860 --> 03:03.060
I can't get a single
field commander on the phone.

03:03.060 --> 03:04.660
How are we supposed to come up

03:04.660 --> 03:06.130
with a global strategic plan?

03:06.130 --> 03:07.330
He's right.

03:07.330 --> 03:09.000
The President may have declared war,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.600
but right now we don't have
a military to fight it.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.870
We've got nothing.

03:12.870 --> 03:14.600
Not true.

03:14.610 --> 03:16.740
We have <i>Nathan James.</i>

03:21.150 --> 03:26.880
Many of you here
are new to the Navy...

03:26.880 --> 03:28.880
new to this ship.

03:28.890 --> 03:32.020
Some of you,
we've been here before.

03:32.020 --> 03:36.220
Either way,
what happened in Mayport

03:36.230 --> 03:39.830
is not something
you ever get used to.

03:39.830 --> 03:41.500
It hurts.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.430
And it was meant to hurt.

03:43.430 --> 03:46.900
That's what our enemy wanted to do.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.570
And today, he succeeded.

03:51.980 --> 03:54.240
It caught us off guard,

03:54.240 --> 03:59.310
sent a powerful message,
trying to shake our resolve.

04:00.790 --> 04:03.720
But a war isn't lost
because we're hurt.

04:05.520 --> 04:09.120
For over 200 years,
the United States Navy has

04:09.130 --> 04:13.730
built, sustained, and protected
its war-fighting culture.

04:13.730 --> 04:15.530
This attack doesn't change that.

04:15.530 --> 04:18.870
In fact, it will once again
bring out the best in us.

04:18.870 --> 04:22.140
Our enemies
have underestimated us.

04:22.140 --> 04:26.140
And if you doubt that,
look back at the past few years.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.480
Look at the people
who've been on this ship.

04:30.610 --> 04:32.150
When trouble arises,

04:32.150 --> 04:35.020
we have proven
time and time again,

04:35.020 --> 04:37.750
no matter the enemy,
no matter the odds,

04:37.750 --> 04:40.960
one ship can do it.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.690
<i>This</i> ship can do it.

05:10.350 --> 05:13.890
Gustavo has put a bounty
on your heads.

05:13.890 --> 05:15.490
100,000 pesos each.

05:15.490 --> 05:18.230
Any news on the American fleet?

05:19.900 --> 05:22.500
They're saying it's destroyed.

05:29.570 --> 05:31.040
You know, in Kenya,

05:31.040 --> 05:33.310
we had a nickname
for <i>Nathan James.</i>

05:35.250 --> 05:36.910
It means "invincible."

05:39.720 --> 05:41.850
These rebels...

05:41.850 --> 05:43.850
You think
they have intel we can use?

05:43.850 --> 05:45.520
They haven't been successful
against Gustavo so far.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.060
<i>SÃ­.</i>

05:47.060 --> 05:50.260
It's very hard to beat Gustavo's
army and his microphone.

05:50.260 --> 05:51.790
But the rebels are organizing.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.460
They have a new leader...
Armando Maza.

05:53.460 --> 05:54.800
Oh, the Venezuelan guerilla...

05:54.800 --> 05:56.860
The man who burns people alive.

05:56.870 --> 05:59.530
Don't worry. Armando doesn't
do that to his friends.

07:31.300 --> 07:34.030
Sir, what is that?

07:38.900 --> 07:42.170
Those are our satellites
crashing to the Earth.

07:42.170 --> 07:46.370
Last we heard, the MSC
supply ship was right here,

07:46.380 --> 07:47.580
just 90 miles from us.

07:47.580 --> 07:48.840
We can get there in three hours

07:48.850 --> 07:50.110
to restock our fuel and weapons.

07:50.110 --> 07:51.850
Right now, we are low on both.

07:51.850 --> 07:54.650
Got to figure we could run into
trouble on our way there.

07:54.650 --> 07:55.980
Those Pucaras that hit Mayport

07:55.990 --> 07:57.650
have a max range of 217 miles.

07:57.650 --> 08:00.120
They either came from land
or they got a ride.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.790
Brazil had a carrier,
but even before the plague,

08:02.790 --> 08:04.530
it was never able to run
for more than a few months.

08:04.530 --> 08:07.130
Well, they could have got it running
long enough to launch the attack.

08:07.130 --> 08:09.660
And we can't rule out that
Gustavo could have put together

08:09.670 --> 08:11.470
a fleet of warships
from across South America.

08:11.470 --> 08:13.540
So we're just gonna have to rely
on our single-ship skills.

08:13.540 --> 08:14.870
Yes, sir.

08:14.870 --> 08:17.010
On that, Captain,
what's our sitrep?

08:17.010 --> 08:20.680
Sir, the computer virus
knocked out satellites offline,

08:20.680 --> 08:22.610
leaving us with
no GPS capabilities.

08:22.610 --> 08:25.080
Some E-Loran beacons are still up,

08:25.080 --> 08:28.150
but once we get 30 miles
off the coast, they're useless.

08:28.150 --> 08:31.090
CIC reports radar, targeting,
and weapon systems

08:31.090 --> 08:33.960
were all shut down once
the 400-hertz power grid fried.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.890
So we can't see or shoot?

08:36.890 --> 08:39.429
- Correct.
- We were able to hot-wire passive sonar,

08:39.429 --> 08:41.030
so at least we can hear.

08:41.030 --> 08:43.799
And the five-inch can shoot,
it just can't move.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.240
We also have CIWS
and crew-served weapons.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.970
- What about comms?
- We had to zero out our crypto,

08:49.970 --> 08:51.440
so we can't call fleet command

08:51.440 --> 08:53.910
without giving away our location
or plan of action.

08:53.910 --> 08:56.640
We're really all alone.

08:58.650 --> 09:02.320
Well, my old SWO Commander
used to tell me,

09:02.320 --> 09:03.850
"Looking for sympathy?

09:03.850 --> 09:05.920
Look in the dictionary
between 'syphilis' and 'shit.'"

09:05.920 --> 09:08.390
Gustavo doesn't know
we're alive.

09:08.390 --> 09:09.860
That's to our advantage.

09:09.860 --> 09:11.990
We get to the MSC ship,
we resupply,

09:12.000 --> 09:13.930
and we take the fight to him.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.965
What's this?

09:24.965 --> 09:27.765
All the color-coded plans
and war contingencies

09:27.765 --> 09:30.105
the U.S. Military
and Intelligence communities

09:30.105 --> 09:32.635
have dreamt up
in the past 50 years.

09:32.645 --> 09:34.245
Oh, good.

09:34.245 --> 09:36.105
We have a plan to invade Iceland.

09:36.115 --> 09:37.975
It's better to have a plan
and not need it

09:37.975 --> 09:39.775
than the opposite, I suppose.

09:39.785 --> 09:42.385
Not so long ago,
I remember looking at

09:42.385 --> 09:44.515
a similar plan
for a viral outbreak.

09:44.525 --> 09:47.255
That's before we even knew
what the red flu was.

09:47.255 --> 09:49.185
How'd that work out for you?

09:51.195 --> 09:52.925
Fortunately,
we were able to improvise.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.465
There has to be
some useful intel in here.

09:55.465 --> 09:58.395
<i>This was an attack
not just on the United States,</i>

09:58.405 --> 09:59.865
<i>but on the world.</i>

09:59.865 --> 10:02.935
<i>And as always,
we will rise to the occasion.</i>

10:02.935 --> 10:04.275
<i>I have, therefore...</i>

10:04.275 --> 10:05.605
Admiral Chandler?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.205
Mr. Swain,
before the planes came,

10:07.205 --> 10:10.075
the U.S. was the victim
of a cyberattack.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.685
It killed our satellites,
shut down our anti-access

10:14.685 --> 10:16.345
and area denial systems,

10:16.355 --> 10:19.285
and destroyed weapons control
on all our networked assets...

10:19.285 --> 10:23.625
Ships, tanks, planes,
helos, Aegis, and missile silos.

10:23.625 --> 10:25.025
Whoa.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.895
Your theory was correct.

10:28.025 --> 10:31.095
Grab your things and come with
me. You're gonna be here awhile.

10:32.505 --> 10:34.305
Do you need to call anyone?

10:34.305 --> 10:35.765
I forgot to ask.

10:35.775 --> 10:38.035
Are you married?
Do you live with your folks?

10:38.035 --> 10:39.305
No, sir.
I'm not married,

10:39.305 --> 10:42.245
and, uh, my parents
died in the plague.

10:42.245 --> 10:44.975
Right.

10:46.315 --> 10:48.445
Oh, my God.

10:48.455 --> 10:50.585
You wrote that
U.S. military installations

10:50.585 --> 10:52.985
were extremely vulnerable
to cyberattacks.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.455
That was my conclusion, sir.

10:54.455 --> 10:56.325
It had to do with the number
of nodes and the redundancies...

10:56.325 --> 10:58.195
I need you to find the virus,
where it came from,

10:58.195 --> 10:59.525
and how to get rid of it.

10:59.525 --> 11:02.065
You'll be working
with Commander Granderson.

11:02.065 --> 11:04.065
Good luck, Mr. Swain.

11:04.065 --> 11:06.335
Oh.
Raise your right hand.

11:06.335 --> 11:08.205
POTUS usually does this,
but he's not here, so...

11:08.205 --> 11:11.075
Do you solemnly swear to support
and defend the Constitution...

11:16.675 --> 11:18.075
So help you God?

11:18.075 --> 11:20.275
I do.

11:20.285 --> 11:22.015
Congratulations, Ensign Swain.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.685
You are now a member
of the United States Navy.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.085
Get to work.

11:29.955 --> 11:34.695
You can put your arm down,
Ensign.

11:46.305 --> 11:48.575
We're close.

11:49.645 --> 11:51.575
It's only a few more kilometers.

11:58.055 --> 11:59.785
Easy, easy.

11:59.785 --> 12:02.385
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:15.275 --> 12:17.405
They look like gringos.

12:28.615 --> 12:29.815
He knows who we are.

12:29.815 --> 12:32.825
And I don't think
he wants to be our friend.

12:32.825 --> 12:34.285
Hey, hey!
Hey!

12:34.285 --> 12:37.095
Drop...
your weapons.

12:37.095 --> 12:38.555
I don't think so, <i>amigo.</i>

12:42.435 --> 12:44.365
Oh, crap.

12:44.365 --> 12:46.965
Danny Green.

12:46.965 --> 12:49.105
Is that you?

12:49.105 --> 12:50.375
Pablo?

12:50.375 --> 12:53.305
Can't believe it.
Get over here.

12:54.915 --> 12:57.645
No freakin' way!

12:58.915 --> 13:00.885
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.655
<i>SÃ­, sÃ­.</i>

13:06.655 --> 13:07.885
<i>SÃ­.</i>

13:12.465 --> 13:14.865
Pablo, this is Wolf.

13:14.865 --> 13:16.325
Hey.
Hey.

13:16.335 --> 13:18.865
This is Marco, Sasha, Kandie.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.465
"Pablo"?

13:20.465 --> 13:23.605
Yeah, well, "Paul Shemanski" doesn't quite
have the same street cred down here.

13:23.605 --> 13:24.935
Pablo's D.I.A.

13:24.945 --> 13:26.335
He's been in the jungle so long,

13:26.345 --> 13:27.875
he's practically gone native.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.545
We worked joint ops
in Brazil and Colombia

13:30.545 --> 13:32.145
back in the day.
Yeah.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.745
Well, thank God for D.I.A.
Thank God.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.485
Man, I heard about Mayport.

13:41.495 --> 13:43.625
Your buddies on <i>Nathan James?</i>

13:43.625 --> 13:45.355
No news yet.

13:45.365 --> 13:47.365
My wife's the CO.

13:47.365 --> 13:49.825
Oh, man.
I'm sorry.

13:50.495 --> 13:53.835
Now I'm seeing your ugly-ass mug
all over the local news.

13:53.835 --> 13:55.165
Not a coincidence.

13:55.175 --> 13:56.435
I figured.

13:56.435 --> 13:58.035
Things are definitely heating up.

13:58.035 --> 13:59.635
All right, come on.

13:59.645 --> 14:01.505
I'll catch you up on the way.

14:01.515 --> 14:04.175
Danny frickin' Green.

14:07.445 --> 14:08.715
Ma'am,
according to our last sight,

14:08.715 --> 14:10.655
we're here on our L.O.P.

14:10.655 --> 14:12.185
That's approximately 10 miles
southeast of the supply ship.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.925
Very well.

14:13.925 --> 14:17.795
O.O.D., continue along charted course.
Aye, ma'am.

14:17.795 --> 14:19.995
O.O.D., I've got
multiple objects in the water,

14:19.995 --> 14:22.125
starboard side,
bearing 0-1-2 relative,

14:22.135 --> 14:23.935
approximately 3,000 yards.

14:39.485 --> 14:41.215
Someone hit a container ship

14:41.215 --> 14:42.745
with a large-caliber weapon.

14:42.755 --> 14:44.485
Jesus.

14:44.485 --> 14:46.825
It looks like the goods
were bound for Mexico.

14:46.825 --> 14:49.225
Incoming!

14:49.225 --> 14:51.695
General quarters.
Start evasive maneuvers!

14:53.025 --> 14:55.765
Bridge reports bulldog inbound,
bearing 1-4-1.

14:55.765 --> 14:57.035
I have it.

14:57.035 --> 14:59.165
Impact estimated in 30 seconds.

14:59.165 --> 15:00.765
Missile's almost in range.

15:00.765 --> 15:03.435
Deploy countermeasures!

15:07.505 --> 15:09.775
Missile's path unchanged.

15:09.775 --> 15:12.985
Engaging in 3, 2, 1.

15:12.985 --> 15:14.245
Fire CIWS.

15:18.055 --> 15:20.455
Target splashed.

15:20.455 --> 15:21.925
Nice shot, Valdez.

15:23.525 --> 15:25.455
Where the hell
did that come from?

15:25.465 --> 15:27.265
Wherever it was,
we're outgunned...

15:27.265 --> 15:29.725
Too blind to find, fix, or kill.

15:29.735 --> 15:31.195
Then we have to outrun it.

15:31.205 --> 15:33.005
Helmsman, all ahead,
flank three!

15:33.005 --> 15:35.135
Aye, ma'am.
All ahead, flank three.

15:37.005 --> 15:41.005
Masthead lookout reports
a corvette class warship hull

15:41.015 --> 15:42.205
down on the horizon.

15:42.215 --> 15:44.945
They can see us,
but we can't see them.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.215
All right.

15:46.215 --> 15:48.685
The fight starts here.

15:58.305 --> 16:01.515
Gustavo's taking out
merchant ships to disrupt trade.

16:01.515 --> 16:02.845
It's a classic wartime maneuver.

16:02.845 --> 16:04.245
German U-boats
did the same thing.

16:04.245 --> 16:07.715
He's letting everyone know
Gran Colombia owns these waters.

16:07.715 --> 16:09.515
Relative bearing 2-2-0.

16:09.525 --> 16:13.725
Heading south again...
Definitely a search pattern.

16:13.725 --> 16:14.995
Probably wasn't expecting
to find us.

16:14.995 --> 16:17.595
Now he has. At this range, sir,

16:17.595 --> 16:18.995
that ship
may not have I.D.'d us.

16:18.995 --> 16:20.865
No, but they smell blood
in the water.

16:20.865 --> 16:22.665
Not activating
fire-control radar,

16:22.665 --> 16:25.265
shooting down
their missile with CIWS...

16:25.275 --> 16:26.535
we tipped our hand.

16:26.535 --> 16:28.335
This island
won't mask us forever.

16:30.005 --> 16:31.745
I'm starting by

16:31.745 --> 16:33.615
looking through
vulnerabilities in the system.

16:33.615 --> 16:35.275
You know Metcalfe's Law, sir?

16:35.285 --> 16:37.685
It basically means the more
redundancies a system has,

16:37.685 --> 16:38.945
the safer it is,

16:38.955 --> 16:40.615
but this hack
proved the opposite.

16:40.615 --> 16:42.085
Instead of being an asset,

16:42.085 --> 16:43.555
the redundancies
are actually what sank us...

16:43.555 --> 16:46.625
So Metcalfe's Law only
in reverse.

16:46.625 --> 16:48.425
The system
that was designed to protect us

16:48.425 --> 16:49.825
is what destroyed us.
Yes, sir.

16:49.825 --> 16:51.295
Sort of an
all-your-eggs-in-one-basket

16:51.295 --> 16:52.565
scenario, sir.

16:52.565 --> 16:54.295
Once the virus
got into the system,

16:54.295 --> 16:56.835
it used our redundancies and
spread across our entire network.

16:56.835 --> 16:59.165
So how'd it get into the system
in the first place?

16:59.175 --> 17:02.105
That I don't know...
yet.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.175
Not till I can read the code
of the virus.

17:04.175 --> 17:06.645
Look, all I know is that
the worm was powerful...

17:06.645 --> 17:09.775
More powerful than anything
I've seen before.

17:12.915 --> 17:15.655
Gustavo's amassed
a huge South American army...

17:15.655 --> 17:17.454
40,000 troops at least.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.655
He's moving them north out of
Colombia across the Darien Gap.

17:20.655 --> 17:22.595
I thought it was impossible,

17:22.595 --> 17:24.464
nothing but swampland
and forest.

17:24.464 --> 17:26.125
It was until now.

17:26.135 --> 17:28.795
And Gustavo built the bridge.

17:28.805 --> 17:31.405
Once he gets his troops
across the Darien Gap,

17:31.405 --> 17:33.675
he'll be able to move them
all the way up to Mexico.

17:33.675 --> 17:35.405
How do you plan to stop them?

17:35.405 --> 17:37.145
- You're gonna blow up the bridge.
- That's right.

17:37.145 --> 17:39.405
Gustavo's troops arrive
at the Panama side tomorrow.

17:39.415 --> 17:40.545
That's when we strike.

17:41.945 --> 17:44.345
Sounds like
just the kind of trouble

17:44.345 --> 17:46.145
we were looking for.

18:01.235 --> 18:03.765
Where do
all of these men come from?

18:03.765 --> 18:05.705
FARC, military defectors,

18:05.705 --> 18:07.705
even your average Joe citizen.

18:09.905 --> 18:13.645
And some are the same narcos
we used to take down.

18:14.985 --> 18:17.445
They're all the same side now.

18:17.445 --> 18:19.785
The only thing they hate
more than each other...

18:19.785 --> 18:21.455
is Gustavo.

18:21.455 --> 18:24.325
I thought Tavo was supposed to
be a man of the people.

18:24.325 --> 18:25.655
Ah, he's like Escobar...

18:25.655 --> 18:27.655
Does just enough good
to maintain the myth.

18:27.655 --> 18:29.395
That's what keeps him in power.

18:29.395 --> 18:30.665
His ruthlessness, he hides.

18:30.665 --> 18:32.025
Come on.

18:34.595 --> 18:35.935
Sasha...

18:35.935 --> 18:38.005
this is as far as I go.

18:38.005 --> 18:39.535
What?
Where are you going?

18:39.535 --> 18:40.875
I have a family, a son.

18:40.875 --> 18:42.735
I can't leave Panama like this.

18:42.745 --> 18:44.145
But I promised
to get you out safe.

18:44.145 --> 18:46.675
And you did.
Thank you for everything.

18:46.675 --> 18:48.015
No, no.

18:48.015 --> 18:51.015
On me.
Anything for CIA.

18:52.555 --> 18:55.015
Hey, be safe.

18:55.025 --> 18:57.955
You, too.

19:13.975 --> 19:16.305
They're getting closer to us
and the supply ship.

19:16.305 --> 19:18.645
We're faster.
We can make a run for it.

19:18.645 --> 19:21.245
Then we lose the chance
to refuel and resupply.

19:21.245 --> 19:25.245
Last they saw, the U.S. fleet
was burning in Mayport.

19:25.255 --> 19:29.655
Seeing a warship out here
has got to have them wondering.

19:29.655 --> 19:31.225
"How many
did I miss?"

19:32.195 --> 19:33.795
"Who else
is out here?"

19:33.795 --> 19:35.395
We can use that
to our advantage.

19:36.395 --> 19:39.995
What do you have in mind?
They're looking for one ship.

19:39.995 --> 19:43.665
Let's show them
we got a whole fleet.

19:43.665 --> 19:46.405
Eddie?
Why does our EMATT have a name?

19:46.405 --> 19:48.875
Named after our C.O.'s
first boyfriend.

19:48.875 --> 19:50.405
She said
he always tried to pretend

19:50.405 --> 19:51.605
to be bigger than he was.

19:51.615 --> 19:52.805
Oh, that's cold.

19:52.815 --> 19:54.275
So little Eddie is gonna pretend

19:54.275 --> 19:56.015
to be a big, bad submarine.

19:56.015 --> 19:58.015
When he shows up
on the bad guy's sonar,

19:58.015 --> 20:00.015
they're gonna crap their pants.

20:00.015 --> 20:01.815
Ah, classic Eddie.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.825
This is us.

20:04.485 --> 20:06.825
The corvette is here.
Based on their search pattern,

20:06.825 --> 20:08.155
we can predict
where they're going next.

20:08.155 --> 20:10.295
We let them cross here.

20:10.295 --> 20:13.695
They'll run right into Eddie.

20:20.435 --> 20:22.775
Our one ship becomes two.

20:22.775 --> 20:24.305
If all goes right,

20:24.305 --> 20:28.445
Eddie will drive the corvette
this way towards the SLQ-49.

20:37.325 --> 20:39.725
Right here!

20:45.335 --> 20:47.265
Ready?

20:47.265 --> 20:48.865
Yeah.
Heave!

20:59.275 --> 21:00.945
That is amazing.

21:00.945 --> 21:02.875
Rubber Duck's in position.

21:08.285 --> 21:10.625
Corvette's radar
hits the SLQ-49,

21:10.625 --> 21:13.495
they'll think they're looking at
the broadside of a cruiser.

21:13.495 --> 21:15.155
Two ships become three.

21:15.165 --> 21:18.765
Our fleet
chases the lonely corvette here,

21:18.765 --> 21:21.765
where our frozen five-inch gun
is waiting.

21:24.565 --> 21:26.705
Eddie is in position, ma'am.

21:30.505 --> 21:34.045
Seaman Bell, how long
have you been in the Navy?

21:34.045 --> 21:36.245
Three months tomorrow, sir.

21:36.245 --> 21:38.045
You've got your sea legs?

21:38.045 --> 21:39.585
Yes, sir.
Good.

21:39.585 --> 21:41.515
We're about to take on
a corvette class warship

21:41.525 --> 21:43.985
using only our five-inch.
Which can't move.

21:43.985 --> 21:46.725
The only way to aim it
is by steering the ship.

21:46.725 --> 21:49.395
We're using the ship
as a rifle, sir?

21:50.595 --> 21:52.865
I grew up in Texas.
Been hunting my whole life.

21:52.865 --> 21:54.865
Never thought about it
like that,

21:54.865 --> 21:56.535
but, yeah, that's about right.
All right.

21:56.535 --> 21:58.005
The ship's our rifle.

21:58.005 --> 22:00.875
This is our gun sight.
We're your spotters.

22:00.875 --> 22:03.545
Commander Burk and I will call
out course corrections to you.

22:03.545 --> 22:07.215
As soon as that corvette comes
in our crosshairs, we fire.

22:07.215 --> 22:08.815
Any questions, Bell?

22:08.815 --> 22:10.815
No, sir.
I'm ready.

22:10.815 --> 22:12.345
Good.

22:12.355 --> 22:14.985
Let's go hunting.

22:18.455 --> 22:23.095
<i>Mexico stands firm
against atrocity and tyranny.</i>

22:23.096 --> 22:26.125
<i>Gustavo Barros does not speak
for all Latin Americans.</i>

22:26.135 --> 22:28.135
<i>After the horrors
of the past few years,</i>

22:28.135 --> 22:30.335
<i>we should be
counting our blessings</i>

22:30.335 --> 22:33.535
<i>and coming together as one,
regardless of our latitude.</i>

22:33.535 --> 22:35.405
<i>War is not the answer,</i>

22:35.405 --> 22:39.345
<i>and Gran Colombia's aggression
in the Gulf must be stopped.</i>

22:39.345 --> 22:41.015
Mexico is the key.

22:41.015 --> 22:43.345
Gustavo can't win the continent
without it.

22:43.345 --> 22:45.885
That's got to be
Gran Colombia's next move.

22:45.885 --> 22:48.485
He's just gonna leapfrog
over Central America?

22:48.485 --> 22:51.025
Mexico falls,
the rest will follow.

22:51.025 --> 22:53.555
Centers of gravity.

22:53.555 --> 22:55.895
Centers of gravity.

22:55.895 --> 22:57.495
Here.

22:57.495 --> 22:59.895
Costa Hirviendo.

23:02.035 --> 23:03.765
Mexico's largest oil terminal.

23:03.765 --> 23:06.505
It supplies fuel to airports
and military bases

23:06.505 --> 23:07.705
all over North America.

23:07.705 --> 23:08.905
If Gustavo took that,

23:08.905 --> 23:10.305
he wouldn't just cripple Mexico.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.045
He'd have enough fuel
to move his army

23:12.045 --> 23:14.775
and his entire fleet north
right into our backyard.

23:14.785 --> 23:16.315
We need to defend that terminal.

23:16.315 --> 23:17.585
With what?

23:17.585 --> 23:20.255
These plans assume
a 300-ship Navy,

23:20.255 --> 23:23.055
a standing Army,
and a working Air Force,

23:23.055 --> 23:24.785
not to mention a fighting force

23:24.795 --> 23:26.325
of a million soldiers
and sailors.

23:26.325 --> 23:28.395
Admiral Chandler, I have
nothing but respect for you,

23:28.395 --> 23:30.465
but my objection still stands.

23:30.465 --> 23:32.795
We need all our people
protecting our own border.

23:32.795 --> 23:34.865
Our borders are weak and porous.

23:34.865 --> 23:36.405
You said it yourself, General.

23:36.405 --> 23:38.535
Your own troops are spread thin.

23:38.535 --> 23:40.405
If we don't stop them
down south,

23:40.405 --> 23:43.005
they will cut us in half
at the Texas border.

23:43.005 --> 23:44.745
And what about our allies?

23:44.745 --> 23:47.345
We can't just abandon them.

23:47.345 --> 23:51.485
If we were to try
and defend the terminal...

23:51.485 --> 23:54.415
Anita, are you
seriously considering this?

23:54.415 --> 23:56.085
You lost hundreds of Marines
in Mayport.

23:56.085 --> 23:57.955
It's because of
the Marines I lost

23:57.955 --> 23:59.885
I'm considering this, Don.

23:59.895 --> 24:02.095
Admiral, Don's right.

24:02.095 --> 24:04.625
We don't have
the logistical infrastructure

24:04.635 --> 24:07.095
to support
a huge operation down there,

24:07.095 --> 24:10.965
but if we were,
what do you have in mind?

24:13.375 --> 24:16.235
We send <i>Nathan James</i>
to the Gulf...

24:16.245 --> 24:19.505
then supplement with troops
from the other branches.

24:19.515 --> 24:22.045
Admiral, no one is questioning
the contribution

24:22.045 --> 24:24.445
your ship has made
to this country, but...

24:24.445 --> 24:25.515
they're one ship.

24:25.515 --> 24:27.785
You haven't even
heard from them.

24:27.785 --> 24:29.855
They'll call.

24:30.925 --> 24:35.395
So, you're asking us to throw
the football down the field

24:35.395 --> 24:36.925
and just hope
there's a receiver there.

24:36.925 --> 24:38.125
Yes.

24:38.125 --> 24:39.525
Because I know them.

24:39.535 --> 24:42.135
They're always there
to catch the ball.

24:42.135 --> 24:43.665
Anita?

24:46.735 --> 24:48.675
I'm sorry, Tom.

24:48.675 --> 24:51.875
Maybe if...
When we hear from <i>Nathan James.</i>

24:51.875 --> 24:54.275
Until we do, I can't,
in good conscience,

24:54.275 --> 24:55.875
take my troops from the border.

24:55.885 --> 24:57.085
The Navy runs
this joint command,

24:57.085 --> 24:58.485
so it's your call.

24:58.485 --> 25:01.415
But if this is the plan
you're recommending to CNC,

25:01.415 --> 25:03.615
I'm afraid it will be
without my signature.

25:15.505 --> 25:17.365
Corvette is approaching
Eddie's position, ma'am.

25:17.365 --> 25:20.705
Activate Eddie!
EMATT is active.

25:20.705 --> 25:22.105
Sonar?
Confirmed, ma'am.

25:22.105 --> 25:23.705
EMATT is emitting and on course.

25:26.515 --> 25:29.445
Corvette is adjusting course,
ma'am.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.785
They're running away from the EMATT.
It's working.

25:31.785 --> 25:33.585
Corvette knows it's no match
for a sub.

25:33.585 --> 25:36.055
We need to keep selling it.
Shut Eddie down.

25:36.055 --> 25:37.525
Make them think it's gone dark.

25:37.525 --> 25:39.925
Yes, ma'am.

25:39.925 --> 25:41.595
Corvette took the bait.

25:41.595 --> 25:44.665
How long till they see
the SLQ-49?

25:44.665 --> 25:47.135
Should be on their radar
seven minutes, sir.

25:47.135 --> 25:48.865
And if they fall for our trick,

25:48.865 --> 25:51.735
they should be within firing
range five minutes after that.

26:18.495 --> 26:22.095
I can't believe
you're still in the fight.

26:22.105 --> 26:23.365
I figured you would have retired

26:23.365 --> 26:24.835
after what you did on the <i>James,</i>

26:24.835 --> 26:27.835
but here you are
in the middle of the jungle...

26:27.835 --> 26:29.105
Still a warrior.

26:29.105 --> 26:30.775
Why is that so hard
to understand, huh?

26:30.775 --> 26:32.575
You, of all people, can relate.

26:32.575 --> 26:35.445
Me, I got nothing else
to live for but to fight,

26:35.445 --> 26:37.385
but you...
You got a wife, a kid.

26:37.385 --> 26:38.715
If I had your life,

26:38.715 --> 26:40.515
I sure as shit
wouldn't be doing this anymore.

26:40.515 --> 26:43.385
Anyway, I'm getting out soon...

26:43.385 --> 26:45.185
Back to the states.

26:45.195 --> 26:47.125
The narcos have a plane.

26:47.125 --> 26:49.525
It makes runs
to northern Mexico.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.195
The narcos are your exfil?

26:51.195 --> 26:53.325
Their planes are
a hell of a lot more reliable

26:53.335 --> 26:54.535
than most airlines today.

26:54.535 --> 26:56.065
Theirs leaves
from a mountain clearing

26:56.065 --> 26:57.535
two days from now.

26:57.535 --> 26:59.205
We hit Tavo's men hard,
take out the bridge,

26:59.205 --> 27:00.735
and I get on the plane
with my intel.

27:00.735 --> 27:03.405
You and your team...
You're welcome to hitch a ride.

27:03.405 --> 27:06.275
Yeah.
We might just do that.

27:06.275 --> 27:08.615
All right.

27:14.755 --> 27:17.755
Ma'am, the corvette
is approaching the SLQ-49.

27:21.025 --> 27:22.225
It's working.

27:22.225 --> 27:24.895
Corvette is turning towards us.

27:25.835 --> 27:29.695
The corvette will be in range
in three minutes, sir.

27:29.705 --> 27:30.965
Very well.

27:30.965 --> 27:32.235
According to plan.

27:35.375 --> 27:36.845
Relax, Bell.

27:36.845 --> 27:38.845
You know you can't hunt
when you're tight.

27:43.915 --> 27:45.785
Ma'am, the corvette
is adjusting course.

27:45.785 --> 27:47.655
It's moving away
from the SLQ-49.

27:49.055 --> 27:51.655
Where's it heading?
Prop noise indicates

27:51.655 --> 27:53.585
it's now approaching the island
from the west.

27:55.125 --> 27:56.595
Yes, ma'am.

27:56.595 --> 27:58.865
They know we're here.

28:01.865 --> 28:04.005
Now what?
We improvise.

28:04.005 --> 28:06.265
No plan survives contact
with the enemy.

28:06.275 --> 28:08.735
Sir, we still have
one more card to play.

28:08.745 --> 28:10.005
Speed.

28:10.005 --> 28:11.745
We chase them down
and take them on in open water.

28:11.745 --> 28:13.875
This is the only island cover
for 30 miles, sir.

28:13.875 --> 28:16.275
We'll have one shot
to catch them by surprise.

28:16.285 --> 28:19.085
One shot's all we'll need. Your job
just got a hell of a lot harder.

28:19.085 --> 28:21.285
It's one thing to fire
from a fixed position,

28:21.285 --> 28:22.555
another thing to do it
on the move.

28:22.555 --> 28:24.155
You up for it? Bell:
Absolutely, sir.

28:24.155 --> 28:26.355
Hunting's no fun
if the game comes to you.

28:26.355 --> 28:29.355
Good.
Take us into open water.

28:42.575 --> 28:45.105
Hey, Pablo's got
a ride out of here.

28:45.115 --> 28:46.575
This all goes to plan,

28:46.575 --> 28:49.115
we can blow the bridge up and...

29:08.865 --> 29:11.665
Kandie! She's alive! Let's move!

29:11.665 --> 29:13.005
I need to find Pablo!

29:13.005 --> 29:16.945
Danny! I'll be right behind you.

29:16.945 --> 29:18.875
Pablo!

29:18.875 --> 29:20.815
Pablo!

29:20.815 --> 29:22.415
Pablo!

29:22.415 --> 29:24.015
Danny!
Hey!

29:24.015 --> 29:26.085
Danny.

29:26.085 --> 29:28.755
I'm gonna get you out of here. Just
hang on. No. Danny, you got to go.

29:28.755 --> 29:31.025
I'm not leaving you!

29:31.025 --> 29:35.095
Aah!

29:35.095 --> 29:36.965
Come on.

29:36.965 --> 29:38.765
Come on.

30:06.255 --> 30:07.455
Azima. Azima.

30:09.595 --> 30:12.195
I'm good. I'm good. Okay, okay.

30:12.195 --> 30:13.865
How did they find us?

30:13.865 --> 30:15.595
Where the hell is Green?

30:27.415 --> 30:29.445
Going somewhere, gringo?

30:59.915 --> 31:01.245
Huh?

31:10.525 --> 31:12.785
<i>Muy bien.</i>

31:34.875 --> 31:36.415
We have a visual.

31:36.415 --> 31:39.015
Bell, two degrees left.

31:39.015 --> 31:40.755
Got it.

31:42.425 --> 31:43.755
- Now.
- Fire.

31:50.895 --> 31:52.095
Hey, gringo.

31:52.095 --> 31:54.935
Are you okay letting
your Latin friends die for you?

32:04.575 --> 32:07.375
One last chance.

32:07.375 --> 32:10.185
Where is Armando?

32:11.585 --> 32:17.455
<i>Yo no hablo ingles...</i>

32:17.455 --> 32:20.455
asshole.

32:24.195 --> 32:26.725
No!

32:26.735 --> 32:27.865
You son of a bitch!

32:27.865 --> 32:31.065
Son of a bitch!

32:32.535 --> 32:34.005
We clipped her stern.

32:34.005 --> 32:35.935
One degree left.

32:38.215 --> 32:39.475
- Now!
- Fire!

32:43.745 --> 32:45.015
Shots landing short.

32:45.015 --> 32:47.485
We have to fire on the rise.
Wait for it.

32:50.625 --> 32:52.955
I have hydrophone effects.
Torpedo inbound.

32:52.955 --> 32:54.955
Ma'am, what do we do?
Our MK 116 is down.

32:54.955 --> 32:56.825
The corvette thought
Eddie was a sub.

32:56.825 --> 32:58.765
Let's make the torpedo
believe the same thing.

32:58.765 --> 33:01.295
Reactivate EMATT.
Aye, ma'am.

33:14.975 --> 33:17.985
We have detonation.
Torpedo destroyed.

33:17.985 --> 33:19.855
EMATT signal has disappeared.

33:20.785 --> 33:22.785
Pour one out for Eddie.

33:22.785 --> 33:24.125
At least he's good
for <i>something.</i>

33:29.265 --> 33:31.795
Ah.

33:31.795 --> 33:34.065
I know who you are.

33:34.065 --> 33:37.705
<i>SÃ­. SÃ­.</i>

33:44.605 --> 33:46.145
Oh, man.

33:46.145 --> 33:49.545
Gustavo's got a big bounty
on your head.

33:49.545 --> 33:50.885
You know that?

33:50.885 --> 33:55.485
They said dead or alive.

33:55.485 --> 33:58.025
If it's all the same to you...

33:59.555 --> 34:01.425
I'm thinking dead.

34:29.855 --> 34:31.655
Four degrees right, Bell.

34:31.655 --> 34:34.255
I'm there.

34:34.255 --> 34:36.725
Wait for it.

34:36.725 --> 34:39.264
Now.
Fire!

34:41.804 --> 34:44.405
Brace!
Incoming!

34:49.745 --> 34:52.205
Battle damage assessment.

34:54.675 --> 34:56.945
We gotta lead him.

34:56.945 --> 34:59.345
Bell, what do you do
when you're hunting bird?

34:59.355 --> 35:00.615
Aim in front of them, sir.

35:00.615 --> 35:03.485
Left rudder, four degrees.
Aim for my thumb.

35:03.485 --> 35:05.085
Yes, sir!

35:05.085 --> 35:06.555
I'm there.

35:07.625 --> 35:08.755
Now!
Fire!

35:08.765 --> 35:12.095
Two rounds.

35:21.975 --> 35:23.775
We have detonation.

35:23.775 --> 35:25.175
The ship is breaking apart.

35:25.175 --> 35:29.115
Target destroyed, ma'am.

35:47.595 --> 35:49.395
Hell of a job, Bell.

35:49.405 --> 35:50.935
Thank you, sir.

35:50.935 --> 35:53.135
Same to you,
if you don't mind me saying.

35:56.475 --> 35:58.545
Damage report!

37:35.345 --> 37:37.145
<i>IViva Tavo!</i>

38:47.945 --> 38:50.545
You all right?

38:51.045 --> 38:52.785
Aah!

38:52.785 --> 38:55.055
22 dead, our camp destroyed,

38:55.055 --> 38:58.325
and we lost most of our weapons
and explosives.

38:58.325 --> 39:00.125
Do you have reinforcements?

39:00.125 --> 39:02.455
They're scattered
across the jungle, days away.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.995
So we find another moment
and make a play...

39:04.995 --> 39:07.065
No.
There's too many of them.

39:07.065 --> 39:08.795
I don't think we can manage...

39:08.805 --> 39:10.405
I'm not turning back.

39:10.405 --> 39:13.675
Not now.

39:13.675 --> 39:15.075
Danny, we can't just keep...

39:15.075 --> 39:17.675
If Gustavo gets his troops
across that bridge,

39:17.675 --> 39:18.875
it's game over, right?

39:23.015 --> 39:25.685
That's right.

39:28.155 --> 39:30.485
I'm not ready
to concede the game.

39:32.225 --> 39:34.155
None of you have to stay.

39:34.155 --> 39:36.625
But Pablo gave his life
for this mission.

39:38.035 --> 39:40.565
I plan to finish it.

39:44.705 --> 39:46.905
Right.

39:46.905 --> 39:49.575
Then let's blow up that bridge.

40:03.385 --> 40:08.455
Ma'am, O.O.D. wishes to report
we have hull integrity.

40:08.465 --> 40:10.125
They're patching and repairing
damage from the enemy ship.

40:10.125 --> 40:12.065
In addition, the replenishment
is now complete.

40:12.065 --> 40:13.665
Requesting permission to untie.

40:13.665 --> 40:14.935
Very well.

40:16.605 --> 40:18.135
They put quite a hole
in our side.

40:18.135 --> 40:20.135
Four feet to the left,
it hits our fuel lines.

40:20.135 --> 40:22.405
Now that we're loaded up,
we need to call Southcom,

40:22.405 --> 40:24.075
tell them we're ready
to join the fight.

40:24.075 --> 40:25.805
How?
We've got no crypto.

40:25.815 --> 40:27.875
It's still too risky to talk
on an open channel. No.

40:27.885 --> 40:29.945
We need a code.

40:41.095 --> 40:42.555
<i>Command Cent...</i>

40:42.565 --> 40:45.295
<i>Command, come in.
Do you read?</i>

40:45.295 --> 40:46.625
<i>Command.</i>

40:47.835 --> 40:50.235
<i>Command Center, come in.</i>

40:50.235 --> 40:51.635
Admiral Chandler?

40:51.635 --> 40:54.975
There's a call coming in
over HF radio.

40:54.975 --> 40:56.635
It's Admiral Slattery.

41:01.715 --> 41:03.515
This isn't
a secure channel, Mike.

41:03.515 --> 41:04.985
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

41:04.985 --> 41:08.255
<i>I finally got around
to reading your favorite book.</i>

41:08.255 --> 41:09.715
You got your copy handy?

41:09.725 --> 41:11.125
Hold on.

41:11.125 --> 41:13.455
Ensign Swain, do you have
your copy of "Moby-Dick"?

41:13.455 --> 41:14.655
Yes, sir.

41:14.655 --> 41:15.855
We've got it.

41:15.865 --> 41:19.465
Turn to page 366,
5 paragraphs down.

41:19.465 --> 41:20.995
Last 4 words.

41:20.995 --> 41:22.665
<i>Working on it.</i>

41:22.665 --> 41:24.065
<i>This is how we're gonna
have to communicate</i>

41:24.065 --> 41:25.335
<i>for the time being.</i>

41:25.335 --> 41:27.935
