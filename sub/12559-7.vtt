00:10.344 --> 00:12.176
<i>BEYOND IT IS
ANOTHER DIMENSION.</i>

00:12.221 --> 00:14.383
<i>A DIMENSION OF SOUND.</i>

00:14.473 --> 00:18.683
<i>A DIMENSION OF SIGHT.
A DIMENSION OF MIND.</i>

00:18.769 --> 00:21.682

00:54.596 --> 00:58.885
DID YOU SEE GOLDSMITH?
DID HE TALK TO THE OLD MAN?

00:58.976 --> 01:01.058
GOLDSMITH'S STILL
UP THERE.

01:01.144 --> 01:04.057
HE SAID TO TELL YOU HE'S GETTING
A MESSAGE FROM THE OLD MAN.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.684
HE'LL BRING IT DOWN
WITH HIM IN A FEW MINUTES.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.937
IS HE ASKING
ABOUT THIS FOOD?

01:09.027 --> 01:12.395
IT'S ALL PRE-BOMB, ALL OF IT.
IT'S SAFE AS ANYTHING.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.939
<i>WHY DO WE HAVE TO KEEP
WAITING FOR THE OLD MAN?</i>

01:15.033 --> 01:17.115
WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE
OUR CHANCES WITH IT?

01:17.202 --> 01:19.113
WE ALREADY
TOOK CHANCES.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.821
THE OLD MAN TOLD US NOT TO
PLANT ON THE NORTH AOREAGE.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.374
THAT IT WAS POISONOUS.
THIS IS WHAT CAME UP.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.085
DID THESE <i>GROW,</i> EVIE,

01:32.175 --> 01:34.837
OR DID SOMEBODY LEAVE
THEM TO US IN A VVILL?

01:34.928 --> 01:36.134
THEY WERE THE BEST.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.928
THE BEST?

01:39.433 --> 01:41.140
HATE TO SEE
THE WORST!

01:44.855 --> 01:47.688
I DON'T THINK WE OUGHT
TO EAT THOSE, EVIE.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.482
I SAY WE JUST BETTER
BURY THEM WITH HONORS.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.730
THAT'S WHAT GOLDSMITH
WENT TO THE CAVE FOR.

01:55.824 --> 02:00.034
TO ASK THE OLD MAN VVHAT LAND
VVE SHOULD TRY THIS TIME.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.282
THE OLD MAN, INDEED.

02:02.331 --> 02:05.414
VVHO KNOVVS VVHERE HE GETS
HIS OMNISCIENT KNOVVLEDGE,

02:05.500 --> 02:10.289

HE KNOWS ABOUT LAND.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.797
REMEMBER THOSE
TOMATOES THAT CAME UP?

02:12.883 --> 02:16.296
YOU REMEMBER HE SENT A MESSAGE TO
GOLDSMITH TELLING US NOTTO PLANT THEM?

02:16.345 --> 02:19.053
<i>OH. THEY WERE MONSTROUS.</i>

02:19.139 --> 02:23.178

ROTTEN WATERMELONS.

MAN HAS TO SAY.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.698
WHAT ABOUT
THE FOOD?

02:46.792 --> 02:50.660
VVAIT TILL GOLDSMITH GETS BACK FROM THE CA\/E.
VVAIT TILL HE HAS A CHANCE TC ASK THE OLD MAN.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.373
<i>I'M SURPRISED
AT YOU, ALL OF YOU.</i>

02:52.464 --> 02:55.923
MAN DOESN'T LIVE BY BREAD
OR CANNED FOOD ALONE,

02:56.009 --> 02:59.001
OR FREAK CARROTS,
OR MUTATED TOMATOES.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.212
<i>BUT DO ME
A FAVOR, WILL YOU?</i>

03:01.306 --> 03:04.424
DON'T ASK ME WHAT

03:06.269 --> 03:09.352
IN THIS TENTH ILLUSTRIOUS
YEAR AFTER THE BOMB,

03:11.900 --> 03:13.516
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO TELL YOU.

03:13.568 --> 03:17.186
ANNOUNCEMENT! I HAVE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

03:19.491 --> 03:23.576
VVE'\/E JUST HAD COMMUNICATION
FROM THE OLD MAN IN THE CA\/E.

03:23.662 --> 03:27.872
THERE'S AN 80% POSSIBILITY OF RAIN
TOMORROW. THE VVIND'S FROM THE NORTHEAST.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.748
THIS MEANS THAT
THERE WILL LIKELY BE

03:29.835 --> 03:32.623
A\/ERY HIGH RADIOACTIVE
COUNT IN THE PRECIPITATION.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.330
<i>NOW, PLACE ALL RAIN

<i>THE OLD MAN SAYS THAT
THEY'RE CONTAMINATED</i>

03:45.600 --> 03:48.558

03:48.603 --> 03:50.389
<i>(narrator)

<i>IS A LEGACY THAT

03:53.108 --> 03:57.602
<i>A DECADE PREVIOUS, HE PUSHED HIS
BUTTONS AND A NIGHTMARISH MOMENT LATER</i>

03:57.696 --> 04:02.281
<i>WOKE UP TO FIND THAT HE HAD SET
THE CLOCK BACK A THOUSAND YEARS.</i>

04:02.367 --> 04:04.654

MEDICINES, HIS SCIENCE

04:07.080 --> 04:10.573

GRAVEDIGGER OF THEM ALL.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.161

TEN YEARS LATER,

04:14.921 --> 04:17.413
A FRAGMENT OF WHAT
WAS ONCE A WHOLE,

04:17.507 --> 04:19.668

WAS ONCE A RACE.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.593
YES, THAT'S
WHAT I SAID.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.546
NOW, HOW MANY PEOPLE
DO YOU HAVE HERE?

05:48.640 --> 05:51.507

COUNTED LATELY.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.009

05:54.062 --> 05:55.393
THERE'S SUFFICIENT.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.347
HM. YOU GROW YOUR OWN?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.232
SOME.

06:00.318 --> 06:04.528
<i>WE HAVE A SUPPLY OF PREWAR
CANNED GOODS LEFT OVER.</i>

06:04.573 --> 06:08.111

06:17.252 --> 06:20.790
MAJOR, UH, WHAT

I DON'T THINK YOU
UNDERSTAND, MAJOR.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.973
WE DON'T RECOGNIZE
YOUR AUTHORITY HERE.

06:37.063 --> 06:41.648
VVE'\/E HAD TRANSIENTS PASS THROUGH
ON OCCASION, BUT THEY DIDN'T STAY.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.727
LIKE YOU, THEY REPRESENTED
THEMSELVES AS AUTHORITIES,

06:44.821 --> 06:48.405
BUT VVE DISCOVERED THEY CARRIED
THEIR HEADQUARTERS VVITH THEM.

06:48.450 --> 06:52.660
<i>THEY REPRESENTED
NO ONE BUT THEMSELVES.</i>

06:52.746 --> 06:54.908
WELL, THIS IS A NEW

IT WILL BE SET UP
INTO MILITARY SECTORS,

EACH CONTROLLED BY
A LOCAL CONSTABULARY.

VVE MIGHT E\/EN ALLOVV YOU TO

07:55.850 --> 07:58.387
BETWEEN BUFFALO, NEW YORK,

THERE ARE PROBABLY AROUND 5OO
PEOPLE ALl\/E. YOU KNOVV VVHY.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.149
BECAUSE THERE'S NO AUTHORITY,
THERE'S NO DISCIPLINE.

08:06.194 --> 08:10.529
<i>WE'RE HERE TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE OF BOTH.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.503
WELL, NOW, WHAT
ABOUT IT, MR. GOLDSMITH?

08:30.593 --> 08:32.504
YOU WANT
TO COOPERATE,

08:32.595 --> 08:34.677
OR DO YOU WANT
YOUR NECK BROKEN?

08:34.764 --> 08:37.176
WE ALREADY HAVE
AN AUTHORITY.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.341
<i>WE'VE HAD HIM FOR
BETTER THAN TEN YEARS.</i>

08:39.436 --> 08:40.847
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

08:40.895 --> 08:44.559
POISON. IT'S
CONTAMINATED FOOD.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.356
WHO SAYS SO?

08:46.401 --> 08:49.268
THE OLD MAN
IN THE CAVE.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.941
A, UH, OLD MAN
IN A CAVE.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.828
HAVE ANY OF YOU LOOKED AT
YOURSELVES IN THE MIRROR LATELY?

09:05.587 --> 09:08.750
YOU ALL LOOK LIKE
SKELETONS, YOU KNOVV THAT?

09:08.840 --> 09:11.207

VVHERE IS THIS OLD MAN VVHO KEEPS YOU

09:14.679 --> 09:20.049
HE NEVER COMES OUT.
HE STAYS IN THE CAVE.

09:20.101 --> 09:23.469
VVELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED, MR. GOLDSMITH.
I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.430

A PACK OF VVEIRDIES UP THERE

09:26.524 --> 09:28.606

09:28.693 --> 09:31.071
<i>AND THEN AROUND WHAT
USED TO BE CHICAGO, MAN,</i>

09:31.154 --> 09:33.896
WE GOT A REAL SWINGING
CULT GOING THERE.

09:33.990 --> 09:37.483
THEY E\/EN BUILT THEMSELVES A STATUE
MADE OUT OF FISSIONABLE LEAD.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.740
THIS IS THEIR DEITY.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.326
<i>WHAT DO WE HA\IE HERE'? WE HA\IE</i>

09:43.416 --> 09:47.410
AN IN\/ISIBLE OLD MAN IN A OA\/E.
NOVV, COME ON, MR. GOLDSMITH.

09:47.462 --> 09:50.329
VVHEN YOU TAKE IT OUT AND RUN IT
AROUND THE BLOCK A COUPLE OF TIMES,

09:50.423 --> 09:53.131
DON'T YOU THINK
IT SOUNDS KINDA NUTTY?

09:53.218 --> 09:55.425
WE'VE SURVIVED,
MAJOR FRENCH.

09:55.512 --> 09:59.096
THE REST OF THE VVORLD HAS DIED OF
RADIOACTIVITY, STRONTIUM 90, PLAGUE.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.764
WE SURVIVED.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.345
BECAUSE OF THE
OLD MAN, HUH?

10:02.435 --> 10:05.268
THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE
OF THE OLD MAN.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.681
HE CUES YOU IN, HUH? HE, UH,
TELLS YOU VVHAT'S POISONOUS,

10:08.775 --> 10:10.641
WHAT'S RADIOACTIVE,

10:10.735 --> 10:13.944
AS LONG AS HE'S ALl\/E,
VVE'LL BE ALl\/E.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.441
BUT YOU
KNOW SOMETHING?

10:19.494 --> 10:23.328
NOVV, I DON'T THINK <i>ANY</i> OF YOU ARE
GOING TO DIE OF RADIOAOTIVITY.

10:23.414 --> 10:26.372
I THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA KICK
OFF, YOU'RE GONNA KICK OFF

10:26.459 --> 10:29.451
EITHER FROM MALNUTRITION OR
FROM BEING CONNED TO DEATH.

10:29.504 --> 10:34.214
IF THAT'S TRUE, MAJOR, AT LEAST
lT'LL BE A PAINLESS DEATH.

10:34.300 --> 10:38.134
<i>MR. GOLDSMITH,
CHECK THIS.</i>

10:38.179 --> 10:40.386
THE BOOKING ODDS

Fl\/E HUNDRED TO ONE THAT YOUR OLD
MAN IS A SOFT-IN-THE-HEAD HERMIT

10:44.769 --> 10:46.635
WHO DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT YEAR IT IS.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.850
THAT'S NOT
FOR US TO SAY.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.398
THAT'S FOR YOU TO <i>ASK!</i>

10:51.484 --> 10:53.225
<i>ALL OF YOU!</i>

FAVORITE RECLUSE.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.659
WE'RE GONNA BRING HIM
OUT IN THE SUNSHINE

11:06.749 --> 11:09.081
AND GET A GOOD
LOOK AT HIM.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.912
AND THEN VVE'RE GONNA DECIDE IF
HE'S VVORTHVVHILE KEEPING ALI\/E.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.122
COME ON, YOU'RE

ALL RIGHT, GOLDSMITH, YOU VVANNA TELL

HOW DOES HE STAY ALIVE?

11:48.333 --> 11:49.823
I DON'T KNOW.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.534
HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE'S INTHERE?

11:51.586 --> 11:53.623
HOW DO YOU
COMMUNICATE WITH HIM?

11:53.713 --> 11:57.627
HE SENDS OUT
NOTES, MESSAGES.

11:59.344 --> 12:03.178
HE SENDS OUT
NOTES AND MESSAGES.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.218
