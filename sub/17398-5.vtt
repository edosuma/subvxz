00:11.209 --> 00:15.148
Tonight,
I talk to a man in sunglasses.

00:15.217 --> 00:17.856
James draws a square on a wall.

00:17.857 --> 00:21.257
And Richard plays with a soldier's chopper.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074

00:30.401 --> 00:33.200
Hello, good evening.
Thank you so much.

00:33.201 --> 00:36.081
Thank you.
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

00:38.041 --> 00:46.040
Now, in the '60s and '70s the TV schedules
were awash with detective shows like The Baron,

00:46.075 --> 00:50.319
Department S, The Protectors, The
Persuaders, The Saint, The Avengers.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.519
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

00:52.520 --> 00:55.439
Let me explain.
They were all basically the same, OK?

00:55.440 --> 00:59.359
Every week a good looking man would
run into a swanky hotel, punch a

00:59.360 --> 01:03.799
swarthy looking man in a Fez and
then go to bed with a pretty lady.

01:03.834 --> 01:07.158
Anyone here old enough to
remember that? Yeah, you, exactly.

01:07.159 --> 01:11.718
The only difference was
the cars they all drove, OK?

01:11.719 --> 01:14.758
This is Brett Sinclair,
Aston Martin DBS.

01:14.759 --> 01:17.398
Steed had a Broadspeed tuned Jag.

01:17.399 --> 01:22.358
And there is The Saint with his Volvo P1800.

01:22.359 --> 01:25.963
Now, the interesting thing is
that almost none of them ever drove

01:25.998 --> 01:30.958
the Jensen Interceptor, and I think
there's a very good reason for that.

01:35.838 --> 01:43.278
It looks fantastic, but it was built very badly by
people who didn't seem to care what they were doing.

01:46.117 --> 01:48.996
Let me give you one example.

01:48.997 --> 01:52.996
When the people on the Jensen production
line needed a new steering rack they'd go to

01:52.997 --> 01:59.196
the steering rack factory and buy one, often
without bothering to check what car it was for.

01:59.197 --> 02:05.757
Some Interceptors were apparently sold fitted
with steering racks designed for the Triumph Stag.

02:07.316 --> 02:12.595
That, then, is why it wasn't
very popular with the TV heroes of yesteryear.

02:12.596 --> 02:15.476
It would never have worked properly.

02:20.436 --> 02:24.715
Now, though, a small company
based here in the lungs of England

02:24.750 --> 02:29.555
has launched an updated version,
which does.

02:37.395 --> 02:41.754
In the old car the big Chrysler
engine turned petrol into noise,

02:41.755 --> 02:44.559
but very little power was produced on the way,

02:44.594 --> 02:48.314
so they've taken that
engine out and thrown it away.

02:51.194 --> 02:56.073
In its place there's a 6.2 litre
V8 from the modern day Corvette.

02:56.074 --> 03:00.673
The rear suspension is modern, too,
as are the brakes.

03:00.674 --> 03:07.193
But, critically, the body, that glorious
Italian styling, that's untouched.

03:07.228 --> 03:10.633
And it still has the best name
ever put on a car...

03:11.713 --> 03:12.953
Interceptor.

03:18.993 --> 03:22.592
So, what we have here then is much
the same as that house over there.

03:22.593 --> 03:29.032
It's old and it's beautiful, but it has central
heating, it has all the appurtenances of modern living.

03:29.067 --> 03:35.471
And unlike that modern day E type we looked
at the other day this doesn't cost £500,000.

03:35.472 --> 03:37.512
This is £112,000.

03:39.032 --> 03:43.631
I know that's a lot if you're on benefits,
but it's not a lot if you're on Elton John.

03:43.632 --> 03:45.996
I mean, if you are Elton John.

03:46.031 --> 03:50.751
And it's really not a lot when
you see what this car can do.

03:54.071 --> 04:00.190
Thanks to 429 horsepower, 0 to 60 is
dealt with in 4.5 seconds

04:00.191 --> 04:05.030
and the top speed is 167.

04:05.031 --> 04:10.190
It goes, then, like that other
interceptor from the period,

04:10.225 --> 04:12.989
the English Electric Lightning.

04:12.990 --> 04:16.428
However, it as thirsty as the jet,

04:16.430 --> 04:18.310
and as noisy.

04:19.550 --> 04:25.589
The engine in this, though,
sounds fantastic... I think.

04:25.590 --> 04:28.429
It's hard to be sure because there's
so much wind noise

04:28.464 --> 04:31.108
coming from here and everywhere else.

04:31.109 --> 04:35.868
It's a reminder, really, that this
car was built in the '70s

04:35.869 --> 04:38.388
in the West Midlands and these words,

04:38.389 --> 04:43.469
"West", "Seventies", "Midlands,"
they're not bywords for quality.

04:45.109 --> 04:49.308
There are other period features
I don't much care for either.

04:49.343 --> 04:52.307
First of all there's the air
conditioning. Two settings,

04:52.308 --> 04:54.787
sauna or Turkish prison.

04:54.788 --> 05:01.107
Then you've got the wipers, which are as good at
removing water from the windscreen as a pair of pencils.

05:01.108 --> 05:03.347
And then there's the steering system.

05:03.348 --> 05:07.307
It's original, so it could be from
a Triumph Stag or it could be from

05:07.342 --> 05:09.586
a lawn mower, who knows?

05:09.587 --> 05:13.746
What I do know is to make the car
move that much

05:13.747 --> 05:17.547
you have to do quite a lot
of flailing at the wheel.

05:19.227 --> 05:23.506
There are, however, some
period features I love.

05:23.507 --> 05:28.146
The traditional white on black dials are
the sort you get in war films, that you tap

05:28.181 --> 05:31.625
when they tell you bad news
and then they tell you good news.

05:31.626 --> 05:33.185
Oh no, I've got no fuel!

05:33.186 --> 05:36.065
Oh, look, I've got a full tank!

05:36.066 --> 05:40.745
I also like having the
dim dip switch on the floor.

05:40.746 --> 05:43.545
And, look at that radio!

05:43.546 --> 05:46.145
'This is the BBC Home Service. '

05:46.146 --> 05:49.226
It's from the James May collection.

05:50.825 --> 05:53.464
So, how do we sum this car up?

05:53.465 --> 05:56.864
Certainly it's more of a
grand tourer than a raging

05:56.865 --> 06:02.024
B road barnstormer, but I
think that what it is most of all

06:02.025 --> 06:04.384
is a time machine.

06:04.385 --> 06:09.824
In my head, right now this is not
Top Gear and this is not 2011.

06:09.859 --> 06:16.743
It's 1972, I have an enormous
moustache and I am the star

06:16.744 --> 06:19.064
of a new TV detective show.

06:28.464 --> 06:30.548
Nice wheels.

06:30.583 --> 06:33.942
Rock your head. I would have done
if you'd gone within a metre of me!

06:33.943 --> 06:36.502
I did! It was like
you're swatting a fly over there.

06:36.503 --> 06:38.341
That was rubbish. Did you see that?

06:38.342 --> 06:39.463
Yeah, it was rubbish.

06:39.464 --> 06:42.542
We can't just go around
pretending to punch each other.

06:42.543 --> 06:47.742
You need a sort of proper sequence. Nice wheels,
by the way. Isn't it just the best thing ever?

06:47.743 --> 06:49.588
We need to sort this out.
We need a plan.

06:49.623 --> 06:56.941
So, we adjourned to the Top Gear office
to plan our Interceptor tribute show.

06:56.942 --> 07:01.821
Why don't we just make the title sequence?
Title sequence is a good idea because

07:01.822 --> 07:05.701
that tells the whole story. It sums up
the atmosphere and the setting. Exactly.

07:05.702 --> 07:08.981
They're always very short and
they often end with a freeze.

07:08.982 --> 07:11.346
Yeah, exactly.
And everyone turns like that.

07:11.381 --> 07:14.300
And there's always somebody
doing karate chops on people.

07:14.301 --> 07:18.500
No, there's always a karate chop,
shooting, car chase. Explosion.

07:18.501 --> 07:20.061
And then there was never any blood.

07:20.062 --> 07:22.020
No. People were shot extensively.

07:22.021 --> 07:24.580
Very close.
Very close, and they never bled.

07:24.581 --> 07:29.460
If anything ever has a button on it
or a light, they're massive. Girls.

07:29.461 --> 07:32.385
Do you remember that
bit in The Persuaders?

07:32.420 --> 07:34.779
Roger Moore, Tony Curtis,
walking along, girl in

07:34.780 --> 07:38.300
a bikini walks between them for no
obvious reason and they both go...

07:39.740 --> 07:42.379
And the good thing about
a karate chop is there's no blood.

07:42.380 --> 07:45.419
Because you wouldn't need blood.
The whole shooting and no blood.

07:45.420 --> 07:48.019
Karate chop, no blood,
you just fall over. There is karate.

07:48.020 --> 07:51.424
You can do a karate chop.
It's just there always was.

07:51.459 --> 07:55.018
You get out of the car, karate.
There was a karate specialist.

07:55.019 --> 07:56.738
You could be a karate specialist.

07:56.739 --> 08:00.499
Yeah. Well, let's get out
there and make a title sequence.

09:10.456 --> 09:13.500
Did you kick that girl
in the crotch? Yes, I did.

09:13.535 --> 09:16.334
It was actually in her crotch?
You could edit that out.

09:16.335 --> 09:18.694
Can I just ask...?

09:18.695 --> 09:22.894
Can I just ask, why don't we
make that every week? Yes, I know.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.814
I want to be a karate expert.
I want an Interceptor.

09:25.815 --> 09:29.134
I want a moustache.
Well, there you go.

09:29.135 --> 09:34.575
Who here would like us to stop making
this rubbish and make that instead? Yes!

09:36.134 --> 09:37.773
Because think of the snogging!

09:37.774 --> 09:40.533
And I tell you what,
I know the girl we could have.

09:40.534 --> 09:44.133
Wendi Murdoch! Blam!

09:44.134 --> 09:48.773
Apparently, according to one newspaper, so
must be true, she growled when she hit him. Oh!

09:48.774 --> 09:51.493
Hammond likes a fighty girl.

09:51.494 --> 09:55.693
Anyway, before we do the news properly,
there's something I need to explain.

09:55.728 --> 09:58.212
Very, very keen viewers may
have noticed that this

09:58.213 --> 10:03.092
hour long programme, is sometimes
62 or even 63 minutes long.

10:03.093 --> 10:08.492
But this week BBC Two have told us it must
be 59 minutes, no ifs or buts, on the nose.

10:08.493 --> 10:11.972
In fact, all the programmes on
BBC Two tonight must be exactly to

10:11.973 --> 10:16.412
length because they're going at
10.00pm live to the MotoGP race.

10:16.447 --> 10:18.851
Yes.
I'm not interested in bike racing.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.731
That's hardly relevant!
Just because you're not interested

10:21.732 --> 10:25.891
doesn't mean that the BBC should deny all the
people who are the opportunity of seeing it.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.811
Bike racing only works on YouTube.

10:27.812 --> 10:31.611
What? Well, you just see the crashes
and then... Oh, don't be sick!

10:31.612 --> 10:35.536
Hands up if you want to
see bike racing? Two...

10:35.571 --> 10:40.170
So, about 8% of the population
want me to get a move on.

10:40.171 --> 10:44.050
Yes, they do, so we're going to
press on and start with the news.

10:44.051 --> 10:48.730
And we start with news you may have heard of
this week, a new flying car has been announced.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.051
It costs £150,000.
Here's a shot of it in the air.

10:51.052 --> 10:54.891
That's what it looks like as an aeroplane.
And here's a shot of it on the ground.

10:55.850 --> 10:59.289
It's just a crumpled aeroplane,
isn't it? It just comes pre crashed.

10:59.290 --> 11:01.889
There's an even bigger
problem I've thought of.

11:01.890 --> 11:04.569
I think everybody knows, James, you
do have a light aircraft,

11:04.570 --> 11:09.369
and before you take off you have to do
pre-flight checks. Well, a few, yeah.

11:09.370 --> 11:11.689
What are they? Eh?!

11:11.690 --> 11:13.409
You have to check the fuel...

11:13.410 --> 11:14.689
Why do you check the fuel?

11:14.724 --> 11:15.969
So it hasn't got water in it.

11:15.970 --> 11:18.328
How would water get into the fuel?

11:18.329 --> 11:21.328
Oh, we haven't got time for this!
No, I'm very interested.

11:21.329 --> 11:22.689
No, we haven't got time for this.

11:22.690 --> 11:27.048
It's only bike racing. James, tell me more
about your pre-flight checks. No, just...

11:27.049 --> 11:28.089
Actually, you know what?

11:28.090 --> 11:33.368
Even I would rather watch bike racing than
listen to James talk about his pre-flight checks.

11:33.369 --> 11:37.648
Exactly, so get on. So, I will move it on.
Now, there's a company in America called SSC

11:37.683 --> 11:39.848
and they brought out a car
called the Aero, which,

11:39.849 --> 11:44.607
for a time, was the fastest car in the world,
verified by Guinness. Faster than the Bugatti Veyron.

11:44.608 --> 11:46.607
Now they've come up with
another new car.

11:46.608 --> 11:50.847
I've got a picture of it here. We have no
details at all, but we do know its name.

11:50.848 --> 11:55.972
It's called the Twatawahfur.

11:56.007 --> 11:59.886
That's interesting. Is this going to
be a rival for the new Pagani Huhurrua?

11:59.887 --> 12:01.686
What?

12:01.687 --> 12:05.006
The replacement for the Zonda,
it's called that Hurh...

12:05.007 --> 12:09.606
Hurraher. It's spelt H-U-A-Y-R-A.
The Hurh...

12:09.607 --> 12:14.606
Huayra. So, you've got a choice now, if you're
a wealthy person, between the Twatawahurrr,

12:14.607 --> 12:16.691
or the Hurwarrrrrrrr.

12:16.726 --> 12:21.965
So, are car makers now naming their cars after the
noises people make when they're punched in the stomach?

12:21.966 --> 12:24.126
The Lamborghini Blurgha!

12:26.566 --> 12:29.605
Mini recently announced a new car.

12:29.606 --> 12:32.565
It's called The Mini
Inspired By Goodwood.

12:32.566 --> 12:36.885
Stupid name, stupid price. £41,000.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.484
For a Mini? For a Mini.

12:38.485 --> 12:41.444
41 grand. However, Aston
has now gone one better, OK?

12:41.445 --> 12:46.324
We've got this new car, it's
called the Cygnet and Colette

12:46.325 --> 12:48.164
and that's £43,000. Eh?!

12:48.165 --> 12:49.924
43 grand for that!

12:49.925 --> 12:53.964
And we should point out
that is a Toyota iQ.

12:53.965 --> 12:55.969
Yes, it starts out as an 11 grand
Toyota.

12:56.004 --> 13:01.483
Aston Martin take the Toyota badges off, put
Aston Martin ones on, the price goes up to 31,000.

13:01.484 --> 13:04.963
They've now added the
Colette badges, 43 grand.

13:04.964 --> 13:07.444
So, what do you get for that
extra 12 grand on top, then?

13:07.445 --> 13:10.323
You need to look inside.
Here they are, two cushions.

13:13.084 --> 13:16.123
Wait a minute.
What is the Cygnet AND Colette?

13:16.158 --> 13:19.162
It sounds like a lap dancing duo
from Leeds.

13:19.163 --> 13:22.602
An ice skating duo,
Cygnet and Colette.

13:22.603 --> 13:26.202
No, to be honest, we know that the
Cygnet part is an Aston Martin Cygnet.

13:26.203 --> 13:27.802
It's the Colette thing.

13:27.803 --> 13:30.883
What is Colette? It sounds
like a feminine hygiene product.

13:34.083 --> 13:36.162
What? I made a mistake.
Did you?

13:36.163 --> 13:38.327
You get more than just the cushions.

13:38.362 --> 13:45.481
I do apologise. You also get
quilted sun visors, some biscuits.

13:45.482 --> 13:47.201
I'm just quoting what you get.

13:47.202 --> 13:51.601
"A guide to Paris,
a plastic camera, an empty bottle

13:51.602 --> 13:56.681
"and four compilation CDs featuring
bands such as The Morning Benders. "

13:57.801 --> 14:01.760
So, basically they're selling you
a small Toyota full of clutter.

14:01.761 --> 14:04.360
Oh, now, the most
important thing, obviously.

14:04.361 --> 14:08.360
A couple of weeks ago I
showed you all a bird deposit

14:08.361 --> 14:11.360
on the back of my Range Rover.
You may remember. Yes, we do.

14:11.361 --> 14:16.360
And I invited viewers to send in pictures of
bird dirt on their car that was more substantial.

14:16.361 --> 14:20.121
We've had some, I admit.
Oh, yeah. Here's one from Africa.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.360
I think we know who did it!
This is a marabou stork.

14:24.361 --> 14:26.679
God's cruellest joke, this bird.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.719
Yeah, we haven't really got
time for one of your bird lectures.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.879
You're getting it because this is
more interesting than bike racing.

14:32.880 --> 14:36.359
God knew that bird was going to live
in Africa when he gave it bald legs.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.084
Now, I'm sorry, but
that's a bit unkind.

14:39.119 --> 14:42.278
So, its legs get hot and sunburnt
and the only way it can cool them

14:42.279 --> 14:45.678
down, and I'm not making this up,
is to wee on them constantly.

14:45.679 --> 14:48.198
Yeah, but, Jeremy...
So it wees on its legs. Car show.

14:48.199 --> 14:50.558
We're a car show.

14:50.559 --> 14:54.558
A giant stork that wees on its knees
is not strictly our kind of deal.

14:54.559 --> 14:57.238
It is if it's standing
on a Mitsubishi Lancer.

14:57.239 --> 14:59.798
No! Which it is, so there's
a car element to my story.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.636
Anyway there's another... You what?

15:01.637 --> 15:02.678
That's a Galant.

15:02.679 --> 15:04.437
What a cretin you are!

15:04.438 --> 15:07.277
That could well be a Galant.
It's a Galant!

15:09.278 --> 15:14.118
Remind me never to have
him round for dinner.

15:18.678 --> 15:23.517
How did you know it was a Galant, you
can only see the back of the television?

15:23.552 --> 15:27.116
Anyway, I've just humiliated
myself and will now commit suicide.

15:27.117 --> 15:30.356
Except, if I do that you'll be able
to watch the bike racing. - Yes, we will.

15:30.357 --> 15:34.396
So, I won't, I shall keep going
with another bird dirt picture.

15:34.397 --> 15:37.116
Now, I don't think a bird did that.

15:37.117 --> 15:41.876
I think that was a man and I think, if that's
your car, you should report him to the police.

15:41.911 --> 15:45.955
Not that you can because, of course,
they've all resigned. But, anyway...

15:45.956 --> 15:48.635
And that's the end of the news.
It isn't, actually.

15:48.636 --> 15:49.996
Yes, it is. It isn't. It is.

15:49.997 --> 15:52.315
I'm not going to waste time arguing.
Move on!

15:52.316 --> 15:55.235
I will move it on because
I want to talk about sport.

15:55.236 --> 16:00.275
You see, anyone can kick a football around and get
an idea of what it would be like to be David Beckham.

16:00.310 --> 16:04.874
Anybody can pick up a golf bat and get an
idea of what it would like to be a Freemason.

16:04.875 --> 16:09.634
Let's get on with your point. If you want to drive a
Formula One car you have to be a Formula One driver.

16:09.635 --> 16:15.915
An ordinary mortal can't just go into a Formula
One factory and buy one, except now you can.

16:28.994 --> 16:33.673
This is the new Lotus T125.

16:33.674 --> 16:38.993
And straight away, an anorak would
say, "that's not a Formula One car. "

16:38.994 --> 16:41.113
And that's right.

16:41.148 --> 16:42.393
It isn't.

16:43.153 --> 16:48.232
But it does come with a Cosworth V8,
a sequential gearbox,

16:48.233 --> 16:51.072
full downforce,
a complicated steering wheel,

16:51.073 --> 16:55.272
a hand-operated clutch and all
the other F1 trimmings as well.

16:55.273 --> 16:59.112
For instance,
included in the price is Geoff,

16:59.113 --> 17:01.037
who is a fitness instructor.

17:01.072 --> 17:03.951
Alfonso, who will cook for you
and your friends,

17:03.952 --> 17:06.790
and a team of mechanics who
will accompany you

17:06.791 --> 17:10.191
and your car to any race
track in the world.

17:10.192 --> 17:13.711
You also get a truck which is fitted
with all the things you need,

17:13.712 --> 17:16.472
including a Jean Alesi...

17:18.071 --> 17:20.031
So let's just get this straight.

17:20.031 --> 17:23.476
If I buy one of these cars,
I get you,

17:23.511 --> 17:27.990
a former Ferrari Formula One driver,
to teach me how to drive it?

17:27.991 --> 17:29.990
It is like that.

17:29.991 --> 17:32.790
The only problem is that it is single
seat.

17:32.791 --> 17:35.790
When you are in, you are alone.
Well, exactly.

17:35.791 --> 17:38.430
You will have to
follow my instruction.

17:38.431 --> 17:42.675
Jean's first job was to get me
comfortable in the car.

17:42.710 --> 17:46.149
The position is extremely important,
because it is where you will

17:46.150 --> 17:51.869
have the feeling and the feedback
from what is happening.

17:52.990 --> 17:56.589
Now, you see...
No, that is not the correct position.

17:56.590 --> 18:01.069
Well it is the position that I...
that's it. It's my seat.

18:01.070 --> 18:04.434
Because I was
so generously proportioned,

18:04.469 --> 18:09.388
the only option was to remove
the seat altogether.

18:09.389 --> 18:12.028
OK... Well, I'm in. Yeah.
But I am sitting on the floor.

18:12.029 --> 18:16.388
OK, but now, with the foam,
we will feel... With the foam?

18:16.389 --> 18:20.068
A special foam. It's like being
taught by Inspector Clouseau, this.

18:20.069 --> 18:22.593
Is there going to be a "minkey"
coming in a minute?

18:22.628 --> 18:28.067
No, we have a special foam,
and you will really feel at home.

18:28.068 --> 18:32.067
The foam fitting was rather
disturbing.

18:32.068 --> 18:35.267
Why... what are you doing?
You're in my actual anus.

18:35.268 --> 18:38.228
That was my actual anus that
you put your hand in.

18:39.668 --> 18:42.267
It is a part of the programme!

18:42.268 --> 18:46.907
Things that just happened that I
didn't think would happen today...

18:46.942 --> 18:51.546
Jean Alesi, who I used to hero-worship,
is playing with my genitals.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.266
And Jean. Yeah?

18:53.267 --> 18:57.466
Compared to the Formula One cars of,
I don't know, pick a period.

18:57.467 --> 19:01.386
'90s? Is this as fast as that?
I would say '90s, yes.

19:01.387 --> 19:03.026
A lot faster.

19:03.027 --> 19:05.566
This is faster than a '90s
Formula One car?

19:05.601 --> 19:08.105
Yes, because you have a lot
more downforce.

19:08.106 --> 19:11.906
We have a floor which
guarantees 60% of the downforce.

19:13.666 --> 19:17.865
Really? So, it's got more downforce
than even today's Formula One cars?

19:17.866 --> 19:25.265
Definitely, yes. In terms of power,
obviously it's down? We have 640 horsepower.

19:25.300 --> 19:28.425
Which is really enough for 600 kilo.

19:32.145 --> 19:37.584
Soon, I was ready for my first ever
taste of Formula One.

19:43.585 --> 19:45.225
Oh f... no!

19:54.904 --> 19:57.744
Holy cow! Oh!

19:59.744 --> 20:06.143
That's acceleration, and I'm not even
going fully down on the throttle.

20:06.178 --> 20:10.902
It's just terrifying.
Oh, I can't turn the wheel!

20:10.903 --> 20:15.943
My legs are in the way!
God, this is quite horrible!

20:17.023 --> 20:22.622
Unlike a Formula One car, which will
rev to 17 or 18,000...

20:26.022 --> 20:30.582
.. this is limited to just 10,500,
and I'm glad about that!

20:33.582 --> 20:39.061
I've lost all the temperature out of
the tyres. Oh, I don't like this.

20:39.062 --> 20:42.542
No, no, no. No, I don't want this.

20:45.821 --> 20:49.300
Thank you. I've driven a car that's
got this much power before, and I've

20:49.301 --> 20:55.500
driven a car on slicks before, and I
drove a car that weighs as little as

20:55.501 --> 20:58.500
this before, but I've never driven
a car that has all of those things.

20:58.501 --> 21:00.340
Together.

21:00.341 --> 21:02.981
Nicer.

21:04.301 --> 21:07.661
It wasn't nice.
It had been terrifying.

21:09.420 --> 21:13.339
And to explain why,
I switched to my own car.

21:13.340 --> 21:18.699
My mind tells me that it's OK to
turn into the follow-through,

21:18.700 --> 21:22.380
which is coming up now,
at 90 miles an hour.

21:24.980 --> 21:29.979
The thing is, in the Lotus,
I have to tell my mind,

21:30.014 --> 21:34.979
it's OK to go through that corner
at 160 miles an hour.

21:38.739 --> 21:42.938
And what's more, if I tried to do
it in the Lotus at 90,

21:42.939 --> 21:46.598
there won't be enough air going over
the wings, so there won't be much

21:46.633 --> 21:50.258
downforce, and the tyres will be
cold, so there won't be much grip.

21:51.818 --> 21:56.857
If I do it at the speed my mind says
is safe, I will crash,

21:56.858 --> 21:59.017
and I will be killed.

21:59.018 --> 22:06.098
To stay alive, I have to go faster
than my mind thinks is possible.

22:07.297 --> 22:09.896
Then,
there's the question of braking.

22:09.897 --> 22:14.256
If I want to slow down enough at the
hammerhead which is down there,

22:14.257 --> 22:18.256
in this car which has enormous,
ventilated discs, I would

22:18.257 --> 22:24.256
have to start braking at this
point, 140 metres from the corner.

22:24.257 --> 22:28.057
But what if you braked the
Lotus at this point?

22:34.976 --> 22:39.895
So, he's come to a dead stop,
never mind slowing-down enough,

22:39.896 --> 22:43.015
60 yards from the corner.

22:43.016 --> 22:44.975
So, what that means is,

22:44.976 --> 22:48.460
when I'm driving the Lotus,
I have to come past here,

22:48.495 --> 22:55.094
with my foot buried in the loud
pedal, still going like hell here,

22:55.095 --> 22:58.134
still not braking, still not
even thinking of braking

22:58.135 --> 23:00.614
at this point, not here,

23:00.615 --> 23:03.095
that would be stupid, I would look
like an idiot.

23:03.096 --> 23:07.294
My mind is now SCREAMING at me,
stop! Stop!

23:07.295 --> 23:10.134
You're going to be killed,
but I'm still accelerating.

23:10.169 --> 23:15.893
And when I get to about here,
then I'll brake.

23:15.894 --> 23:19.174
And I don't think I've got the balls
for that.

23:22.454 --> 23:26.854
To spur me on,
I unchained the Stig.

23:29.213 --> 23:33.652
Unlike me, this is a man that drives
as fast as a car will go,

23:33.653 --> 23:36.052
not as fast as he thinks he can go.

23:36.053 --> 23:40.892
And what he's doing now is setting
a lap time on our short circuit

23:40.893 --> 23:45.853
in V8 powered Ariel Atom, the
fastest road car we've ever tested.

23:48.852 --> 23:52.452
He did it in 36.2 seconds.

23:54.652 --> 23:58.211
So, can a fat, frightened
51-year-old man

23:58.212 --> 24:02.972
overcome the limitations of his own
mind and beat that time?

24:04.572 --> 24:06.571
Wish me luck, everybody.

24:06.572 --> 24:07.932
Oh, bloody hell!

24:13.771 --> 24:16.610
Going a bit too hard through there!

24:16.611 --> 24:19.250
I've got to get used to these
brakes!

24:19.251 --> 24:20.770
They just feel useless

24:20.771 --> 24:24.810
until you stand on them!
It's all over the place!

24:24.811 --> 24:28.370
I am literally all over
the place here!

24:28.371 --> 24:33.971
37.9, Jeremy.
37.9 seconds was my last lap!

24:35.930 --> 24:39.490
The whole thing is jumping about
like a wild animal!

24:42.250 --> 24:44.729
Come on, Jeremy! Yes!

24:44.730 --> 24:46.729
Oh, Jesus, no!

24:46.730 --> 24:50.329
Ballsed it up. 37.7.

24:50.364 --> 24:54.408
37.7. Oh, no!

24:54.409 --> 24:57.328
Oh, for crying out bloody loud!

24:57.329 --> 25:01.409
Clearly it was time for
another chat with Yoda.

25:02.289 --> 25:07.168
Gears for the corners,
Hammerhead, second?

25:07.169 --> 25:11.208
Second, for the first one, for the left. And
first for the right. First for the right?!

25:11.243 --> 25:13.847
Yes, because otherwise,
the car is pushing down,

25:13.848 --> 25:19.687
so you use the engine braking to make
the back slide a little bit. Yep.

25:19.688 --> 25:24.527
Then, you keep the 6th for the fast
corner. 6th gear? Keep the 6th.

25:24.528 --> 25:28.127
Then, second gear. For the Chicago.
Through the tyres. Yes. Yes.

25:28.128 --> 25:29.728
And then...

25:31.527 --> 25:35.046
With the noise curfew on our track
fast approaching,

25:35.047 --> 25:38.247
this was my last chance to
beat 36.2 seconds.

25:39.447 --> 25:44.287
20 minutes. 20 minutes to try
and beat that time.

25:46.687 --> 25:49.807
Come on, now, come on!
Come on! Come on!

25:52.486 --> 25:57.125
Yes, finally, I have got the Chicago worked out.

25:57.126 --> 25:58.645
Come on!

25:58.646 --> 26:01.526
Feeling cramp in my hands!

26:03.646 --> 26:07.126
37.5, Jeremy. 37.5!

26:14.205 --> 26:21.605
Oh, that's braking! And the neck!
My neck is absolutely destroyed!

26:23.485 --> 26:28.085
That's 37 dead. 37. Come on!

26:31.525 --> 26:34.125
Ow, my head!

26:36.284 --> 26:38.364
Come on! Come on! Come on!

26:42.564 --> 26:46.923
35.8. Yes! Yes! Yes!

26:46.924 --> 26:51.523
35.8! 35.8!

26:51.524 --> 26:55.724
Eat that, Stig!
Yes, yes, yes!

26:58.203 --> 27:04.363
I'm a Formula One driver! Yes! Yes!

27:09.403 --> 27:12.362
Well done. Thank you. Well done.
And I looked good.

27:12.363 --> 27:16.842
I looked good in that suit.
I am slightly. What? No, well done.

27:16.877 --> 27:20.081
You did good.
But I'm slightly confused by this.

27:20.082 --> 27:22.482
So, if you buy one of these,
you don't actually race it.

27:22.483 --> 27:26.481
No, what you do is,
you hire a track, you ring Lotus,

27:26.482 --> 27:29.881
they bring your car to the track
with the mechanics, the chef,

27:29.882 --> 27:32.521
all the things I talked about there,
and you drive it around

27:32.522 --> 27:35.461
until your neck hurts
and then you go home.

27:35.496 --> 27:38.400
How much does all this cost?
£650,000.

27:38.401 --> 27:40.720
You see, that is quite a lot.
Is it worth it?

27:40.721 --> 27:43.800
Well, if you're one of the Scottish
people that won the Euro

27:43.801 --> 27:47.000
lottery millions, then, you know,
it's probably worth it.

27:47.001 --> 27:48.961
I mean, you'd have
to lose a few pounds.

27:48.962 --> 27:52.840
I don't mean that cruelly.

27:52.841 --> 27:55.805
I genuinely don't mean that cruelly,
and anyway,

27:55.840 --> 28:00.799
people in glass houses. But, the
fact is, it's agony. It really is.

28:00.800 --> 28:05.439
I was going around Chicago, yet my head
is just really, like it's being pulled off,

28:05.440 --> 28:08.519
and you know you can't accelerate to
go round to the Hammerhead,

28:08.520 --> 28:12.559
until you can get your head back upright and
rested on the air box. I know what you mean,

28:12.560 --> 28:15.804
because when I drove that F1 car on
the show a few years ago,

28:15.839 --> 28:19.398
I could not believe how fast you had
to go to make the thing work.

28:19.399 --> 28:23.598
The thing is, that Formula One car that you
drove, came round here with the Stig at the wheel,

28:23.599 --> 28:27.438
did a lap in 59 seconds,
now we were very keen to find out

28:27.439 --> 28:31.958
if this would go faster, so we brought it down
here the other day, and you won't believe this,

28:31.959 --> 28:34.319
in the middle of July in a British
summer, it was raining!

28:34.354 --> 28:37.637
And in a show where we're already
tight for a time,

28:37.638 --> 28:40.197
there is really no
point entering a wet lap in this,

28:40.198 --> 28:45.077
what with that tell us? So we'll get it back on a
dry day and report back on how it does. Yes, we will.

28:45.078 --> 28:48.957
Now, it's time to put a star in
our reasonably priced car.

28:48.958 --> 28:51.877
Now, my guest tonight has long,
straggly hair

28:51.878 --> 28:56.557
and an incredible ability to heal
the sick and feed the hungry.

28:56.592 --> 29:00.076
Ladies and gentlemen, Jesus...

29:00.077 --> 29:03.437
it's Bob Geldof!

29:04.797 --> 29:09.517
How are you? Have a seat. Sir Bob!

29:12.357 --> 29:14.796
Great to have you here. Thank you.

29:14.797 --> 29:17.641
Obviously, you've topped what used
to be called the hit parade,

29:17.676 --> 29:22.475
you fed the world, but what a lot of people
don't know, is that you built the M25.

29:22.476 --> 29:27.355
I built the M23 and M25, Jeremy.

29:27.356 --> 29:29.636
I didn't even know you
built the road to Gatwick as well.

29:29.637 --> 29:32.835
If you know the Merstham interchange
where you come off the 23

29:32.836 --> 29:38.560
onto the 25, that is more or less
were I had my road digging career.

29:38.595 --> 29:44.674
And that is Geldof Corner. I know you've got
Gambon Corner, which I'm sure we'll see later.

29:44.675 --> 29:48.554
Geldof corner is there, hence the
tailbacks for miles on the M25.

29:48.555 --> 29:52.994
So, when you go round that, actually, it's one
of the best corners on the motorway network.

29:52.995 --> 29:55.074
And you built that! I built that.

29:55.075 --> 29:59.039
Long before I could drive a car,
they gave me the chance to

29:59.074 --> 30:04.913
drive these immense machines which I think,
it was 11 forward gears and six reverses.

30:04.914 --> 30:08.273
Two engines.
You've got two throttles,

30:08.274 --> 30:10.474
you've got to sit like this with
both feet on the throttles,

30:10.475 --> 30:13.673
and a big bucket in the middle,
which you drop, and off you go.

30:13.674 --> 30:16.633
And is it hard? It's hard.
I was crap. Yes.

30:16.668 --> 30:21.312
And so you ran over a herd
of cattle.

30:21.313 --> 30:24.753
I ran over practically the same thing,
a guy from the county council.

30:26.353 --> 30:28.273
On the haul roads,
as they're called,

30:28.274 --> 30:30.912
there are no other vehicles allowed.

30:30.913 --> 30:34.032
And the county council guy was
nosing around there for some reason.

30:34.033 --> 30:36.772
I came around the bend,
and here he was in his Renault 4L,

30:36.807 --> 30:39.511
and he just saw this huge thing
and this 18-year-old without

30:39.512 --> 30:44.551
a driving licence coming
down the track.

30:44.552 --> 30:47.471
And I slammed on the brakes

30:47.472 --> 30:52.151
and these huge tyres just rolled
over the front of the Renault,

30:52.152 --> 30:56.711
the bonnet, and I saw the windscreen
pull away from the top

30:56.712 --> 30:59.651
and just flatten the engine
and he was just like this.

30:59.686 --> 31:02.590
I don't know what was happening in
the seat of his pants,

31:02.591 --> 31:05.870
but I saw what was
happening to his face

31:05.871 --> 31:08.311
and I thought he was dead,
I thought I'd killed him.

31:08.312 --> 31:14.310
He got out. The foreman came gunning up on
his Land Rover and just, I thought I was gone.

31:14.311 --> 31:18.790
I was just on the way out, and he was
just SCREAMING at this guy who got fired.

31:18.825 --> 31:23.269
The council official got fired?
Yes. Well that saved the council a few bob!

31:23.270 --> 31:26.589
One of the things that I read about
your road building career

31:26.590 --> 31:29.429
is that your nick name on the
site was Dublin.

31:29.430 --> 31:30.509
Yes.

31:30.510 --> 31:35.989
Wouldn't that apply to absolutely
everyone, also working on the site?!

31:35.990 --> 31:39.794
No. Hey, Dublin! 5,000 people!
"What?!"

31:39.829 --> 31:44.188
No, because there were two crowds,
essentially,

31:44.189 --> 31:47.028
building the roads, certainly with
this construction company,

31:47.029 --> 31:50.148
there was a West Country crowd and
there were as an Irish crowd.

31:50.149 --> 31:53.388
It was like, I landed in India,
not that long back,

31:53.389 --> 31:56.228
on an Air India flight, and there
were three other Air India flights,

31:56.229 --> 31:59.068
and this is in India, and there was
a man at the barriers

31:59.103 --> 32:01.867
with a sign saying, Mr Patel,
and I just thought,

32:01.868 --> 32:04.308
that's not going to work, is it?!

32:05.308 --> 32:09.707
It's the same as Dublin on this
site. What sort of driver are you?

32:09.708 --> 32:11.587
Not good. Really, I'm not.

32:11.588 --> 32:16.787
I've got a Previa, because I
had 600 children. And, you know...

32:16.788 --> 32:20.347
And 900 names between them. Yes.
And all excellent.

32:20.382 --> 32:24.426
And, you know, it's just,
a superb thing.

32:24.427 --> 32:27.426
You're up high,
you have got this big, broad vision.

32:27.427 --> 32:30.146
You go like this
and the wheel turns.

32:30.147 --> 32:33.386
You've just got endless amount of
power in the thing.

32:33.387 --> 32:37.266
There isn't an endless amount of
power in a Toyota Previa.

32:37.267 --> 32:40.346
It's a horrible car.
No, it's not, it's really not.

32:40.381 --> 32:43.185
I'm Mr Big on Toyota.

32:43.186 --> 32:46.785
I've got a Lexus, so I don't pay
the congestion charge.

32:46.786 --> 32:52.225
Oh, the hybrid one. And also, Jeremy, I
think you should start now becoming a little

32:52.226 --> 32:56.665
more environmentally aware.
You know.

32:56.666 --> 33:00.385
I am very aware of the environment

33:00.420 --> 33:04.104
and I'm still not interested in it.

33:04.105 --> 33:08.264
You're a businessman now.
Sometimes.

33:08.265 --> 33:12.664
And you've got a lot of TV production companies.
So, how much time do you have left for music?

33:12.665 --> 33:18.144
As most of the time, I do music,
so there's still a lot of the

33:18.145 --> 33:22.149
time spent on the Africa stuff,
business stuff, music

33:22.184 --> 33:25.623
and the family, but the only thing
I like doing, being specific,

33:25.624 --> 33:28.423
the only thing that I like doing is
music. Really?

33:28.424 --> 33:32.863
You're touring, soon, aren't you?
Yes. September and November here.

33:32.864 --> 33:36.903
So, North and South. Because you
had the album out, what...?

33:36.904 --> 33:38.424
Three months ago. Three months ago.

33:38.425 --> 33:43.143
Which was Bob Geldof age, well, it's actually,
what was it, 58 and three quarters? 58 and a half.

33:43.178 --> 33:47.022
I was going to call it that,
and then I saw a book called How To

33:47.023 --> 33:50.902
Compose Popular Songs That Will Sell
and I thought, that was more ironic.

33:50.903 --> 33:52.862
It's a good title, that. Yes.

33:52.863 --> 33:57.342
It doesn't fit on iTunes very
easily, how to, oh, there we go.

33:57.343 --> 34:01.062
You released that three months ago. Why,
because you know how to use iTunes?! I do!

34:01.097 --> 34:04.741
What do you listen to in the car?
What do I listen to?

34:04.742 --> 34:08.541
Rat Trap, I Don't Like Mondays.
Classics.

34:08.542 --> 34:12.661
Classics from the late '70s.
Yes.

34:12.661 --> 34:16.380
I presume you've got an iPhone
thing. No, I don't have that.

34:16.382 --> 34:20.860
We spent about two hours before this
extolling the virtues of the Nokia 6310.

34:20.896 --> 34:24.980
Does anyone remember the 6310? Yeah.
Five days without a charge.

34:24.981 --> 34:30.699
Well, that's how long I do, because I've
got no friends, so nobody rings me up.

34:30.701 --> 34:34.739
There's self-evident reasons.
The jeans, being one.

34:34.741 --> 34:38.340
At least I put socks on!
No, he came here.

34:38.341 --> 34:41.560
Look, I'm wearing a sock! But you
don't have beautiful ankles.

34:41.594 --> 34:44.779
A beautiful turned ankle is
something that I admire in somebody.

34:44.780 --> 34:50.179
Your lap, how did it go out there?

34:53.900 --> 34:58.699
I am so crap at this. You start off,
and you're really nervous.

34:58.700 --> 35:01.704
I'm not a speed head,
and then I start to enjoy it

35:01.739 --> 35:06.018
and be able to focus on what the
Stig told me. And I slowed down.

35:06.019 --> 35:09.858
Who would like to
see the lap? Not me.

35:09.859 --> 35:12.898
Come on, let's have a look,
let's see how it went.

35:18.379 --> 35:20.178
Come on.

35:20.179 --> 35:25.038
Already, we need the bleep machine
there. Right, first corner.

35:25.073 --> 35:29.898
Where are we going? Nice,
wide line, like the look of that.

35:32.458 --> 35:35.257
Might be time to change gear.
So slow. Go, go.

35:35.258 --> 35:38.497
You've got to change up.
Where are we going?

35:38.498 --> 35:43.662
Oh, wide, you see, that's too fast.
That's skidding wide.

35:43.697 --> 35:49.176
Clarkson, Stig said it's raining now
and the track is getting slippery,

35:49.177 --> 35:53.576
so, that's going to slow me down,
so shut up, I'm not making excuses.

35:53.577 --> 35:57.456
Let's have a look at this
torrential rain, yes,

35:57.457 --> 36:01.097
I can see what the state means.
That's pouring down out there.

36:02.257 --> 36:04.796
Wait, I don't mean pouring down,
do I?

36:04.831 --> 36:07.335
It looks so slow
yet feels so fast.

36:07.336 --> 36:11.095
No, that is just quite slow.
Change gear!

36:11.096 --> 36:15.735
Take this extreme bend at
full throttle, which is frightening.

36:15.736 --> 36:21.936
Oh, I say, that's good. Your
instinct tells you to slow down.

36:24.335 --> 36:28.934
Ooh! You managed to stay off the
bumpy bit, there. This is the worst.

36:28.935 --> 36:33.374
Gambon corner. Oh, it is the worst.
Absolutely awful. This is Gambon.

36:33.375 --> 36:35.374
And you're... a little bit too slow.

36:35.375 --> 36:37.734
Didn't use all of the road,
but never-the-less,

36:37.735 --> 36:40.094
across the line!

36:46.454 --> 36:53.173
Last. Where do we think?
Third last. Third last? Yeah.

36:53.174 --> 36:57.973
What, Louie Spence speed?
Yeah. 1.53... No, that was wet. Yours was dry.

36:57.974 --> 37:00.933
These are all wet.
You need to be looking above them.

37:00.934 --> 37:04.938
I know they are as people,
but with regards to...

37:04.973 --> 37:08.932
So, anyway, Bob Geldof.
Don't say and I'll watch it at home.

37:08.933 --> 37:14.612
I'm embarrassed. Seriously.
It was rubbish. You did it... Look at him!

37:14.613 --> 37:18.213
You did it in two minutes...

37:20.373 --> 37:26.297
I'm joking. I fully expect that.

37:26.332 --> 37:31.411
He was going, "Mmmm? Mmmm, really?"
One minute 40...

37:31.412 --> 37:32.971
eight

37:32.972 --> 37:38.011
point one. I don't think that is...

37:41.932 --> 37:44.331
Faster than Jeff Goldblum!

37:44.332 --> 37:48.216
Oh, God. Average at everything!

37:48.251 --> 37:51.370
Well, not really. I was just
thinking, you're - what are you,

37:51.371 --> 37:54.290
a Knight of the British Empire?

37:54.291 --> 37:57.610
You were nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.

37:57.611 --> 38:00.690
And now, you are the 14th fastest
celebrity ever to go round

38:00.691 --> 38:05.171
our track in a Kia Cee'd. You could
have walked faster than that.

38:06.810 --> 38:12.009
Hands up those that think you could do...
who could be in the top ten if you did it.

38:12.010 --> 38:14.009
Come on, hands up if you think...

38:17.730 --> 38:24.089
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,
liars, Bob Geldof!

38:26.809 --> 38:30.049
Well done. Thank you very much.
Bob Geldof, everybody!

38:35.489 --> 38:39.888
How are we doing for time? No, we're all
right. We're all right. Just press on.

38:39.889 --> 38:42.008
Now, the other day,

38:42.009 --> 38:45.728
we received a challenge from
the world demolition champions.

38:45.729 --> 38:49.208
We're not actually making that up.
There really is such a championship!

38:49.243 --> 38:52.687
There is, and they said to us that they reckon they could knock down

38:52.688 --> 38:55.287
a row of houses
faster than we could.

38:55.288 --> 38:58.127
So naturally, we were prepared
to accept this challenge,

38:58.128 --> 39:00.607
but first, we thought we'd do
a bit of practice.

39:00.608 --> 39:04.327
So we got in touch with our
old friends in the Albanian Mafia

39:04.328 --> 39:07.607
and asked them if they had anything
that needed knocking down.

39:07.642 --> 39:08.967
Luckily, they said, "Yes!

39:08.968 --> 39:12.246
"There's a man who annoyed us
very much indeed and it would be

39:12.247 --> 39:15.806
"an enormous help if you would come
over and smash his house to bits. "

39:15.807 --> 39:17.447
So, we did.

39:19.647 --> 39:25.887
This is the poor chap's house. This
is where he had obviously tripped up.

39:27.166 --> 39:29.606
And these are the machines
we'd be using.

39:32.006 --> 39:33.686
That there is a digger.

39:34.926 --> 39:36.486
That is a bulldozer.

39:37.526 --> 39:41.285
And that down there is a big crane
with the pecky thing on the end of it.

39:41.286 --> 39:44.566
Bagsy I have that, it's the biggest.
Bagsy I have the bulldozer. I'm having it.

39:45.206 --> 39:47.365
'With our choices carefully
worked out,

39:47.400 --> 39:49.524
'Jeremy was keen to get cracking... '

39:49.525 --> 39:51.044
Come on! Go, go, go!

39:51.045 --> 39:54.324
'.. but I thought it best
we first examine the house. '

39:54.325 --> 39:59.084
This building is basically
a steel-reinforced concrete frame...

39:59.085 --> 40:02.244
a series of uprights and then beams
joining them together...

40:02.245 --> 40:06.204
and then all the gaps are filled in
with these things, which are pot bricks.

40:06.205 --> 40:09.644
These are not structural.
They're there simply to...

40:14.924 --> 40:16.523
OK...

40:16.524 --> 40:22.203
Ye-e-e-s! You are history!

40:22.204 --> 40:25.044
Oi! Not yet!

40:29.483 --> 40:32.682
'Throughout the rest of the day,
there were some issues.

40:32.683 --> 40:36.882
'I, for example, was not
that accurate with the digger. '

40:36.883 --> 40:40.763
Oh, no, no! Hang on, hang on.

40:45.523 --> 40:47.883
'Jeremy nearly caused a power cut.

40:51.042 --> 40:54.881
'And when Richard stopped off
in town to buy some tea,

40:54.882 --> 40:59.721
'he got a bit confused
with all his lorry's levers. '

40:59.722 --> 41:06.322
Do you do tea?
English breakfast tea for workers.

41:10.121 --> 41:13.881
'But the biggest problem we had
was the house itself. '

41:17.481 --> 41:18.721
Come on!

41:20.841 --> 41:25.160
May? What? It won't fall down.
You try.

41:25.161 --> 41:29.481
'If I'm honest,
that wasn't a great suggestion.

41:35.400 --> 41:38.919
'Everything else we tried failed
as well. '

41:38.920 --> 41:40.920
Back! Give it some welly.

41:49.040 --> 41:53.019
'In fact, by the time Hammond
got back from clearing up his mess,

41:53.054 --> 41:56.999
'it was almost dark and the house
was still pretty much intact. '

42:07.559 --> 42:09.959
Baffling. Absolutely baffling.

42:11.078 --> 42:15.197
Clearly, clearly, it wasn't our fault
that the house was still standing.

42:15.198 --> 42:18.437
No, which left us
with two possibilities.

42:18.438 --> 42:21.117
Either Albanian houses
are built superbly well,

42:21.118 --> 42:26.437
which seems unlikely,
or those diggery things and the pecky thing,

42:26.438 --> 42:29.117
that equipment was no good.

42:29.118 --> 42:33.237
We very quickly concluded that it
was the equipment that was no good.

42:33.272 --> 42:35.436
So for our challenge
with the experts,

42:35.437 --> 42:38.477
we decided
to use military equipment.

42:40.677 --> 42:44.836
This is the Witham Army
Disposal Yard in Lincolnshire.

42:44.837 --> 42:47.317
It's a giant toy cupboard.

42:51.316 --> 42:54.556
And everything you see here
is for sale.

42:56.436 --> 43:02.035
Can we use this to demolish the house? No,
you can't use any weapons. Just the vehicle.

43:02.036 --> 43:05.315
Hammond, the driving position
has got you in mind in a Scorpion.

43:05.316 --> 43:09.515
Is that what this is?
Yeah. £30,000. That's what it costs.

43:09.516 --> 43:13.955
Already, I'm seeing buildings just
fall down of their own free will.

43:13.990 --> 43:18.394
Didn't James Blunt use one of these
in Kosovo? It's got peddles!

43:18.395 --> 43:20.354
I thought he had a guitar.

43:20.355 --> 43:23.554
It's the Stormer.
Yeah, the Stormer.

43:23.555 --> 43:28.794
Come on. 20 grand, maximum. Stormer!
That's a good name. £20,000.

43:28.795 --> 43:31.399
So this, or a Ford Focus.

43:31.434 --> 43:36.633
Inside, there was more. And soon,
Hammond started to lose focus.

43:36.634 --> 43:41.393
This is your absolutely bog standard
British Army Land Rover,

43:41.394 --> 43:47.113
cupboard for either, like, you know,
parking ticket money or bullets.

43:47.114 --> 43:53.753
Oh, he's found a Land Rover.
94,000 gentle miles. In a war zone.

43:53.788 --> 43:56.792
Richard... not really what
we're looking for.

43:56.793 --> 44:00.592
Please don't look at Land Rovers.
OK.

44:00.593 --> 44:03.512
That's the fuselage of a Harrier.

44:03.513 --> 44:05.792
These are fantastic.

44:05.793 --> 44:08.552
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

44:08.553 --> 44:11.352
Come on, chaps. Yeah, there's
nothing else to see in here.

44:12.992 --> 44:17.591
Oh, my... Bloody hell.
Hammond's found the helicopters.

44:17.592 --> 44:23.111
Gazelles. Hey! Oh! Well,
that's it. That's my life over.

44:23.112 --> 44:28.111
'With both my colleagues now
otherwise engaged, I went off on my own

44:28.112 --> 44:33.512
'to find a vehicle that might be
suitable for our demolition project. '

44:36.471 --> 44:40.110
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Saxon.

44:40.111 --> 44:43.830
It has an eight-litre,
six-cylinder diesel engine.

44:43.831 --> 44:46.110
Top speed - 30 miles an hour.

44:46.111 --> 44:50.471
Or 60 if the tyres
haven't been shot through.

44:51.911 --> 44:55.630
It has all the things you need -
power steering, automatic gearbox,

44:55.665 --> 44:59.950
selectable four-wheel drive,
grenade launchers.

45:02.230 --> 45:04.750
Side windscreen wipers. Oh, yes.

45:06.350 --> 45:09.669
'James, meanwhile, had decided
that a Willys Jeep would be ideal.

45:09.670 --> 45:13.630
'Although he was finding it
quite difficult to explain why. '

45:25.229 --> 45:31.028
The problem is that while you could
drive this through a hail of petrol bombs

45:31.029 --> 45:33.788
and small arms fire
and you'd be fine,

45:33.789 --> 45:37.468
I'm not sure you could drive it
through a building.

45:37.503 --> 45:39.147
Oh, Hammond!

45:42.988 --> 45:46.468
This is a 1977 Westland Gazelle
helicopter.

45:48.508 --> 45:50.907
One of the fastest helicopters built.

45:50.908 --> 45:52.747
Top speed - 193 miles an hour.

45:52.748 --> 45:58.588
Ha-ha! We've got to get us one
of these. We need one of these.

46:00.747 --> 46:04.546
Eventually, I nailed some sense
into my colleagues and we all selected

46:04.547 --> 46:09.146
the vehicles we'd be using
for the demolition challenge.

46:09.147 --> 46:12.226
This is a 434
Armoured Recovery Vehicle.

46:12.227 --> 46:15.026
I've gone for it in this spec
because it's got a crane,

46:15.061 --> 46:17.625
which could be very useful to us.

46:17.626 --> 46:21.025
But if all else fails,
it weighs 15 tonnes,

46:21.026 --> 46:24.345
so I could just use it
as a sort of battering ram.

46:24.346 --> 46:28.945
As you would imagine, mine is much
bigger than Hammond's. This is a CET...

46:28.946 --> 46:32.945
a Combat Engineering Tractor. And
they're all very encouraging words.

46:32.946 --> 46:36.905
It has a bucket on the front
and many other things besides.

46:36.940 --> 46:40.864
Unlike James's, mine is white.
It's also absolutely excellent.

46:40.865 --> 46:44.144
The tiller on the front
is used for mine clearance,

46:44.145 --> 46:48.424
but it can also be used
for pulling down houses.

46:48.425 --> 46:50.824
In my mind. What?

46:50.825 --> 46:54.184
Why is it white? United Nations. Ah!

46:54.185 --> 46:57.424
Yes, this very vehicle has just
come back from the Middle East

46:57.459 --> 47:00.703
where it cleared 100
anti-tank mines.

47:00.704 --> 47:04.023
It's kind of focused on one thing,
isn't it? Mine clearance.

47:04.024 --> 47:08.023
It is a mine clearing...
You aren't clearing mines.

47:08.024 --> 47:09.504
We are knocking a house down.

47:09.505 --> 47:12.423
You've focused on one thing
and we are not doing that thing.

47:12.424 --> 47:15.423
It's a very, very specialised
piece of equipment.

47:15.424 --> 47:18.503
This... Incredibly specialised -
the cab is on hydraulic rams.

47:18.538 --> 47:21.582
It senses your weight,
raises it to the correct height,

47:21.583 --> 47:25.462
so that if there's a blast underneath,
you're cushioned from that blast.

47:25.463 --> 47:28.702
Again, amazing. But it won't be,
cos we're not clearing a minefield.

47:28.703 --> 47:29.783
We're knocking houses down.

47:29.784 --> 47:32.582
You wait till you see
what happens to a house

47:32.583 --> 47:35.942
when it is presented with THIS
moving at 400 rpm.

47:35.943 --> 47:39.462
If the house explodes,
you'll be OK, but that's about it.

47:39.497 --> 47:42.981
It just goes around doing this...
It's like a mechanical cat.

47:42.982 --> 47:46.501
It's a military machine with some
white paint on it. It isn't military!

47:46.502 --> 47:49.981
It's for clearance and saving lives.
Princess Diana had one of these.

47:53.582 --> 47:55.981
The location for our
demolition challenge was

47:55.982 --> 47:59.181
the Christian Fields housing estate
in Kent.

47:59.216 --> 48:02.380
Each team would have to knock down
six houses

48:02.381 --> 48:04.540
and the professionals rocked up
on the day

48:04.541 --> 48:07.460
with a selection of
conventional equipment

48:07.461 --> 48:09.941
that we knew would not work.

48:11.781 --> 48:17.060
As a result, they would be
humiliated by Team Top Gear.

48:33.500 --> 48:35.380
What a machine this is.

48:37.020 --> 48:38.424
1,300 RPM.

48:38.459 --> 48:41.819
I'm doing very nearly
the top speed of six.

48:43.019 --> 48:46.298
'The other machines
were considerably faster,

48:46.299 --> 48:49.178
'so in order
not to keep the chaps waiting,

48:49.179 --> 48:51.778
'I decided to take a shortcut. '

48:51.779 --> 48:55.698
I think he thought, "The things
on the front go round and smash everything.

48:55.699 --> 48:57.298
"I work for the United Nations. "

48:57.299 --> 48:59.858
He failed to work out
it'll be the slowest..

48:59.893 --> 49:02.257
You don't suppose
by any chance that...

49:05.738 --> 49:08.697
Ladies and gentlemen, Jeremy
Clarkson, sometimes known as

49:08.698 --> 49:13.617
the silver-tongued cavalier of the
Cotswolds. I hope that was to come down.

49:13.618 --> 49:18.462
'Before starting, the professionals
had a pre-demolition briefing. '

49:18.497 --> 49:24.896
All the works today are going to be carried
out under BSEN 6187 demolition code of practice.

49:24.897 --> 49:28.336
Richard, can you hand out the method
statements to all the guys, please

49:28.337 --> 49:31.136
and the risk assessments? Yup.

49:31.137 --> 49:35.176
'Mostly, they talked about health and
safety, so we thought we should, too. '

49:35.177 --> 49:37.936
Don't have an accident.
Don't have an accident.

49:37.937 --> 49:41.216
If you DO have an accident,
remember it was an accident.

49:41.251 --> 49:44.975
'Briefing over,
we got on with discussing the job. '

49:44.976 --> 49:47.975
Why don't you do those, James? OK.

49:47.976 --> 49:52.655
Hammond, you do the cream ones, and
I'll do this lot. That make sense?

49:52.656 --> 49:55.136
Two houses each then, effectively?
Effectively.

49:56.616 --> 50:01.295
'With all the complicated maths out
of the way, it was time to begin. '

50:12.255 --> 50:16.254
OK. Brace, Brace, brace.
We're going in.

50:16.255 --> 50:18.494
Look at his...
He's concentrating like mad.

50:18.495 --> 50:21.215
He looks like a proper orangutan
when he concentrates.

50:22.774 --> 50:25.694
Firing up the rotors!

50:38.814 --> 50:42.373
Why didn't we have this in Albania!?

50:42.408 --> 50:43.693
Goodbye, lavatory!

50:45.693 --> 50:47.212
Bricks flying everywhere.

50:47.213 --> 50:49.373
This is bloody brilliant.

50:51.333 --> 50:55.492
Stop there, stop there! Jeremy,
the roof's going to land on it.

50:55.493 --> 50:59.372
'This was no problem
because my destroyer of worlds

50:59.407 --> 51:03.252
'had a special device
for protecting the driver. '

51:04.412 --> 51:09.931
Is that... a remote control for that?
Yes, it is!

51:09.932 --> 51:13.251
You can drive the whole thing
from there? Yes. From there? Yes.

51:13.252 --> 51:16.051
Do you know how to?
No. But how hard can it be?

51:17.932 --> 51:20.332
Woo-hoo-hoo. Look at that.
Oh, my God!

51:21.291 --> 51:24.290
Now, stand back a bit.
Really? Do you think? Good idea.

51:29.091 --> 51:33.770
'At the other end of the estate, the
professionals were working methodically.

51:33.771 --> 51:36.250
'First removing all the rooves.

51:36.251 --> 51:40.251
'And I thought I'd do the same thing
with my army tank. '

51:41.530 --> 51:45.849
Mounted on the back of my 434 is a
big harpoon. I'll fire that over

51:45.850 --> 51:48.329
with a cable attached,
connect the cable up,

51:48.330 --> 51:51.369
drive this way, pull the roof off,
get on with it.

51:51.370 --> 51:54.410
Live and, well, go.

51:59.810 --> 52:01.669
Brilliant.

52:01.704 --> 52:03.529
Let's begin.

52:04.569 --> 52:08.488
The grappling hook will catch on the
roof. That's it. It's caught it now.

52:08.489 --> 52:10.849
Yeah. Here it comes.
Pulling the roof off.

52:14.529 --> 52:16.329
Let's have a look.

52:17.889 --> 52:19.968
It's not off.

52:19.969 --> 52:24.009
'On the plus side, though, the house
now had another upstairs lavatory. '

52:26.208 --> 52:28.768
Why have you pulled a portaloo
over a building?

52:30.048 --> 52:34.288
It was supposed to pull the roof off.
This isn't demolition, this is just stupid.

52:36.808 --> 52:41.967
'Whilst Hammond persevered
with his idiotic roof-removal system,

52:41.968 --> 52:44.652
'James was busy drawing a diagram. '

52:44.687 --> 52:48.526
The four walls are
pre-cast pieces of concrete

52:48.527 --> 52:52.206
and then in the middle we have this,
which is the chimney breast.

52:52.207 --> 52:56.246
Then there are steal RSJs
running across, like that.

52:56.247 --> 53:00.846
Everything else in between is just wooden
floorboards. So, if we knock out that bit there,

53:00.847 --> 53:05.607
which is holding the house up, the roof and everything
else will fall into a neat pile in the middle.

53:06.646 --> 53:10.045
'My plan involved pulling the
chimney breast out, using

53:10.046 --> 53:13.805
'both my winch and the
sheer power of my combat tractor.

53:13.806 --> 53:17.086
'But it was hard to concentrate
with the orangutan around. '

53:18.726 --> 53:20.726
It's got a mind of its own.

53:22.286 --> 53:25.250
'Having got in everyone's way,
he then started throwing

53:25.285 --> 53:29.085
'massive lumps of road over the
houses and into the next street. '

53:36.285 --> 53:39.004
What have you done?
I hit a water main!

53:39.005 --> 53:40.605
Well, you're an idiot.

53:43.644 --> 53:48.563
'As noon approached, our rivals
were scything through their houses.

53:48.564 --> 53:53.683
'But now my ingenious cable solution
would put us back in the running. '

53:53.684 --> 53:55.244
Here we go.

53:57.804 --> 54:00.604
Oh! Oh, it's so close.

54:07.443 --> 54:12.403
'But despite this success, let's not
forget we still had Jeremy on our side. '

54:19.203 --> 54:21.043
I've lost control completely now.

54:24.242 --> 54:28.601
'In the spirit of teamwork,
I decided to clear up his rubbish

54:28.602 --> 54:31.561
'while Hammond set about
finishing off my house. '

54:31.562 --> 54:35.402
I think I'll need to give this the beans.
Let's not mess about here. In we go.

54:44.641 --> 54:46.880
Oh! The roof came open.
I didn't expect that.

54:46.881 --> 54:51.840
Hammond, what's happened here, mate, is
you are now the foundations of the house.

54:51.841 --> 54:54.600
Um, I think I might be a bit stuck.

54:54.601 --> 54:56.361
Hang on, Hammond. I'm coming.

54:58.481 --> 55:00.880
Where are you going?

55:07.200 --> 55:09.280
Oh dear.

55:10.400 --> 55:12.919
That felt nasty. What happened then?

55:12.920 --> 55:17.240
James crashed into the corner of the house
and now you've got a whole house on your head.

55:19.600 --> 55:20.640
Engine running.

55:23.040 --> 55:26.884
'May then winched Hammond's tank out...

55:26.919 --> 55:29.839
'but Hammond himself was still trapped inside.

55:30.879 --> 55:34.038
'Happily, though, as I'd finally
house-trained my machine... '

55:34.039 --> 55:37.998
Walkies. Yes! Good digger.

55:37.999 --> 55:40.399
'.. I was able to mount a rescue. '

55:43.599 --> 55:44.759
Bad digger!

55:49.878 --> 55:54.078
Oh! I've scratched me tank.

55:56.198 --> 55:59.998
'By now, the professionals
had pulled out an enormous lead.

56:01.878 --> 56:05.917
'So, to try and catch up,
I decided to dig even deeper

56:05.918 --> 56:08.402
'into the military toy box. '

56:08.437 --> 56:11.436
Guys. What...? What on Earth
is that?

56:11.437 --> 56:13.556
I put some explosives in the house.

56:13.557 --> 56:16.476
You might want to stand back.

56:16.477 --> 56:19.597
Because now I'm going to do...
the long walk.

56:25.397 --> 56:29.037
Is that the suit or his piles
that's making him walk like that?

56:41.556 --> 56:44.996
You've only
blown the bloody door off!

56:45.956 --> 56:47.081
'After that failure,

56:47.116 --> 56:51.194
'we decided just to use
our machines as battering rams. '

56:53.075 --> 56:55.315
Come on. Let's just
get this job done.

57:00.995 --> 57:05.995
Not going to use the rotavator.
It's just TOO perilous.

57:09.274 --> 57:12.793
Bloody hell fire! Ha-ha!

57:20.434 --> 57:22.034
Go on. In you go.

57:26.674 --> 57:29.553
'Finally, we were
really getting somewhere. '

57:29.588 --> 57:32.232
Attack!

57:35.713 --> 57:39.832
'The professionals had finished.
They had knocked everything down.

57:39.833 --> 57:42.713
'Whereas we... sort of hadn't. '

57:44.233 --> 57:48.077
Why don't we present them
with a prize, OK... Yeah...

57:48.112 --> 57:53.031
standing just there? Yes. That's a good idea. And
then give them a really loud round of applause.

57:53.032 --> 57:56.511
A thunderous, "WELL DONE, WELL DONE!"
And throw the thing over...

57:57.552 --> 58:01.632
Well done. You beat us
fair and square. Well done.

58:02.992 --> 58:05.871
Can we just point out something very
important?

58:05.872 --> 58:10.316
Well, as long as you're quick,
bike race. I know, I know, I know.

58:10.351 --> 58:15.270
Now you're wasting time saying,
"I know". I know. I know. Say it. Listen...

58:15.271 --> 58:19.430
OK, you may have noticed during that
whole sequence of knocking the houses down,

58:19.431 --> 58:23.470
not one of us was wearing a high-visibility
jacket, a hard hat or substantial shoes

58:23.471 --> 58:26.670
and I think I'm right in saying
that none of us was killed.

58:26.671 --> 58:30.470
And that is an excellent bombshell
on which we could end, so... No.

58:30.505 --> 58:32.910
No, no, no. I want to talk
more about the machine.

58:32.911 --> 58:36.709
No, I said in the film
that this very machine, in fact,

58:36.710 --> 58:38.789
had cleared 100 anti-tank mines.

58:38.790 --> 58:41.949
You're probably thinking,
"How does it survive?" Not really.

58:41.950 --> 58:46.429
I'm going to explain anyway, OK? This is one
of the blades as it comes out the factory, yeah?

58:46.430 --> 58:48.869
This one hit an anti-tank mine,

58:48.870 --> 58:51.914
a mine designed to blow up a tank,

58:51.949 --> 58:55.788
and that is the only damage
that it did.

58:55.789 --> 58:59.348
This is an astonishing piece of
British engineering, I think.

58:59.349 --> 59:02.749
It is. We really must finish. What
are they going to do? Cut us o...?
