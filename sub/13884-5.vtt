00:53.657 --> 00:55.329
OK, OK...

00:55.537 --> 00:58.893
Uphill, slight burrow to the left.

01:00.537 --> 01:04.166
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Ow!

01:11.577 --> 01:18.176
Hey! Four up with six to play!
This guy is hot, hot, hot, hot!

01:18.337 --> 01:20.692
OK, hole 13.

01:20.857 --> 01:23.166
What am I doing? What am I doing?!

01:23.377 --> 01:27.848
You're not following through.
Keep your head down and follow through!

01:28.057 --> 01:30.855
- Why am I playing this?
- Because it's Sunday.

01:31.057 --> 01:34.015
Time to relax. Time to chill. Lighten up!

01:34.217 --> 01:36.526
I can't lighten up. I hate my life!

01:36.697 --> 01:40.849
We spend every day devising
more ingenious ways of wasting time.

01:41.017 --> 01:45.852
I'm sick of it. I'm sick of table golf.
I'm sick of tiddlywinks show jumping.

01:46.417 --> 01:51.650
I'm sick of stretching a pair of tights
across the room to play Durex volleyball.

01:51.857 --> 01:55.691
If you like,
we'll kick the golf in the head, OK?

01:56.257 --> 01:58.452
How about a game of Junior Angler?

01:58.617 --> 02:02.849
All the thrills of freshwater fly-fishing
from the comfort of your living room.

02:03.017 --> 02:04.416
No.

02:04.577 --> 02:09.127
Got it. Unicycle Polo.
We could have a quick chukka on floor 14.

02:09.336 --> 02:12.773
It's smeggin' stupid.
Two grown men on unicycles,

02:12.937 --> 02:16.771
belting a beach ball up and down
a corridor with French loaves?!

02:16.937 --> 02:20.054
It's pathetic. It's idiotic. It's... It's... It's puerile.

02:20.257 --> 02:23.215
- Well, you invented it.
- I want a life.

02:23.377 --> 02:28.007
This is worse than prison. In prison,
you can look forward to getting out.

02:28.177 --> 02:33.297
I want to live. I want to meet people.
I want to meet girls. I want to make love.

02:33.497 --> 02:38.048
Well, Junior Angler is the best
you're gonna get out of me, buddy!

02:39.217 --> 02:42.209
Just get out of my face.

02:43.177 --> 02:45.975
OK. OK.

02:46.137 --> 02:51.450
But don't ask me when you want someone to
play soapsud slalom down the cargo ramp.

02:51.617 --> 02:54.256
You can carry your own damn flags.

03:57.577 --> 04:00.694
Lovely service, Lister.
You should have come. Most uplifting.

04:02.657 --> 04:06.650
What's wrong with you? Ah! It's November.

04:06.817 --> 04:09.285
Nearly time for your bath.

04:10.417 --> 04:13.614
Please, just spare me the good mood, OK?

04:13.817 --> 04:16.809
- What happened?
- I'm sick of it, that's what.

04:16.976 --> 04:19.047
I'm just totally, totally sick of it.

04:19.257 --> 04:22.488
- Sick of what?
- Sick of you and your green suits.

04:22.657 --> 04:25.091
Sick of your stupid flared nostrils.

04:25.257 --> 04:28.249
Sick of how you smile when you're being insulted.

04:28.417 --> 04:30.692
I'm sick of the Cat, sick of Holly,

04:30.857 --> 04:33.815
sick of you, sick of me, and as for Kryten...

04:33.977 --> 04:39.654
I'm sick of him. I'm sick of this ship,
sick of this life. I'm just sick of it.

04:45.297 --> 04:47.606
You're unhappy, aren't you?

04:47.777 --> 04:51.213
Joining the Space Corps,
that's when it all went wrong.

04:51.377 --> 04:55.006
If I hadn't,
things could have worked out for me.

04:55.177 --> 04:57.168
That's a tension sheet, isn't it?

04:57.377 --> 05:00.096
I went to school with the guy who invented those.

05:00.257 --> 05:04.489
Things certainly worked out
for him, all right. A millionaire at 26.

05:04.657 --> 05:07.125
Fred Holden. He was in our dorm.

05:07.377 --> 05:10.369
God, he was thick.
"Thickie" Holden, we called him.

05:10.537 --> 05:14.576
"Hello, Thickie. How's your acne?"
He always came bottom in geography.

05:14.737 --> 05:17.809
He thought a glacier
was a bloke who fixed windows.

05:18.017 --> 05:20.850
He did invent the tension sheet.

05:21.057 --> 05:25.926
It's just the stuff they used for packing.
All he did was paint it red.

05:26.137 --> 05:29.209
And you know who he married?
Sabrina Mulholland-JJones.

05:29.417 --> 05:31.772
- The model?
- How can that be?

05:31.937 --> 05:35.327
The most desirable woman in the world
and Thickie Holden,

05:35.497 --> 05:40.287
a spotty gimp who'd blow off the bedcovers
whenever we had cauliflower cheese.

05:40.497 --> 05:43.773
- He had a break. He got lucky.
- I suppose so.

05:43.937 --> 05:47.646
- Did you know anyone famous?
- Charles Keenan. He was famous.

05:47.857 --> 05:50.894
- What did he do?
- Ate his wife.

05:51.097 --> 05:55.056
Sorry to interrupt, but I think
you should come to the photo lab.

05:55.217 --> 05:57.777
Something quite strange is happening.

06:01.857 --> 06:05.850
- These are ordinary photographs?
- What did you do?

06:06.057 --> 06:08.969
I just developed the film, and they came to life.

06:09.177 --> 06:11.850
It's the developing fluid. It must have mutated.

06:12.057 --> 06:16.448
At first, I thought it was just my film,
but it works on any negative.

06:16.617 --> 06:18.653
There's others I've developed as slides.

06:18.857 --> 06:21.451
- Go for it.
- Lights!

06:22.577 --> 06:25.045
That's Frank! It's my brother's wedding!

06:33.097 --> 06:37.852
- Yo! I'm in the photograph!
- Excuse me. Stand aside, please.

06:38.017 --> 06:41.487
- I'm actually IN the photograph!
- You're blocking the shot.

06:41.657 --> 06:44.012
I'm actually at a smeggin' wedding!

06:44.177 --> 06:47.772
- Are you trying to make trouble?
- Wow! I'm back on Earth!

06:47.977 --> 06:51.208
- I'm in a photograph!
- Look, will you clear off?

06:51.377 --> 06:54.335
- Look! He can touch me!
- Hop it.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.931
He can punch me! This is brilliant!

06:57.097 --> 07:02.330
He's punching me again. Fantastic.
All right! All right! OK. I'm going.

07:04.897 --> 07:06.888
I can't walk out of the edge.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.488
In-smeggin'...

07:12.657 --> 07:15.171
- ..credible.
- Try another one.

07:16.497 --> 07:18.965
- What's this?
- It's one of Lister's.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.052
I don't recognise this.

07:24.417 --> 07:26.772
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

07:26.937 --> 07:31.135
Oh, I remember.
I sent away some snaps of me 18th birthday

07:31.297 --> 07:33.572
and got someone's skiing holiday back.

07:33.777 --> 07:37.611
- It's amazing. We're really here.
- I know. Check this.

07:44.617 --> 07:48.815
It even works in black and white.
I tried a really old one, too.

07:51.817 --> 07:55.810
That's Adolf Hitler,
leader of the runners-up in World War II.

07:56.177 --> 08:00.455
I copied it from one of your magazines -
"Fascist Dictator Monthly".

08:00.617 --> 08:03.256
He was Mr October.

08:05.897 --> 08:11.415
Ignore him. He's a complete and total
nutter. And he's only got one testicle.

08:14.777 --> 08:17.291
What's he doing?! He's scuffling with Adolf Hitler!

08:18.417 --> 08:22.888
You can't just stick one
on the leader of the Third Reich.

08:23.057 --> 08:25.446
I nicked his briefcase!

08:32.457 --> 08:34.573
Banana and crisps?

08:35.977 --> 08:37.967
- His diary!
- Allow me.

08:38.136 --> 08:41.015
I'll switch to translation mode.

08:41.177 --> 08:46.126
"Things to remember - stop milk,
pay papers, invade Czechoslovakia."

08:46.337 --> 08:50.774
A present here. "To Adolf. Love,
Staff Colonel Count von Stauffenberg."

08:50.977 --> 08:56.005
That rings a bell. Von Stauffenberg...
He's famous for something.

08:56.177 --> 08:59.408
Wait a minute, he tried to assassinate Hitler

08:59.577 --> 09:02.011
by putting a bomb in his briefcase.

09:02.177 --> 09:04.213
How could I forget that?

09:17.777 --> 09:20.769
Yes! We've got ourselves
a smeggin' time machine.

09:20.977 --> 09:25.175
- So we can go absolutely anywhere?
- Providing we have a photograph.

09:25.337 --> 09:29.649
So if I had a photograph of a female-only
naturist beach in Acapulco,

09:29.817 --> 09:34.447
full of bronzed, naked teenage
temptresses, we could go for a holiday?

09:34.617 --> 09:37.085
- I suppose.
- Kryten, get my photo album.

09:37.737 --> 09:42.128
Hang on. We can't move
outside the confines of the photograph.

09:42.297 --> 09:44.492
- What we see is all we get.
- Meaning?

09:44.697 --> 09:49.168
We can't just get a picture of Earth.
We'd stay inside the photograph.

09:49.377 --> 09:53.689
This beach shot in Acapulco,
you wouldn't want to leave the photograph.

09:53.897 --> 09:56.889
- So it's useless, then?
- No, not entirely.

09:57.057 --> 09:59.935
Think of the famous places we could go.

10:00.137 --> 10:03.288
We could go to Dallas in November 1963,

10:03.457 --> 10:05.846
stand on the grassy knoll and shout, "Duck!"

10:09.857 --> 10:14.089
I'm sorry,
I must have bypassed my good-taste chip.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.336
The possibilities are enormous, mind-numbing.

10:17.497 --> 10:20.216
We could go back and avert major disasters.

10:20.417 --> 10:24.012
Like persuade Dustin Hoffman
not to make "Ishtar"?

10:24.217 --> 10:29.166
What about determinism? Causality?
You can't just mess about with history.

10:29.377 --> 10:33.893
- We'll just do something small.
- No such thing when you change time.

10:34.097 --> 10:38.807
- Only so we don't get marooned in space.
- Such as?

10:39.537 --> 10:43.769
If I fix it so I don't sign up with Red Dwarf,

10:43.937 --> 10:47.009
I can create an alternate existence on Earth.

10:47.177 --> 10:50.453
I won't be stuck here for three million years.

10:50.657 --> 10:53.171
- How can you do that?
- With this...

10:54.457 --> 10:56.254
and this.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.090
It's ready.

11:20.057 --> 11:22.412
What is this? Who is that jerk?

11:22.577 --> 11:24.568
- It's me.
- You?!

11:24.737 --> 11:28.013
Aged 17. That's me first band,
Smeg and the Heads.

11:28.177 --> 11:32.090
- What are you wearing?
- It was all the rage. "Sham glam".

11:32.257 --> 11:35.135
Look at that collar!
You could go hang-gliding.

11:35.297 --> 11:39.131
I used to think it was so cool. Come on.

11:46.097 --> 11:49.533
This is one of the first songs I ever wrote.

11:50.417 --> 11:52.647
It was called "Om".

11:55.937 --> 11:59.407
Nothing like a good old-fashioned love song, eh?

11:59.617 --> 12:04.407
I genuinely thought we were
gonna be massive. God, I was stupid.

12:04.617 --> 12:08.895
- Who are the other two?
- The hippy drummer's called Dobbin.

12:09.497 --> 12:13.888
He joined the police.
Became a grand wizard in the Freemasons.

12:14.097 --> 12:18.295
The bassist's called Gazza.
He was a neo-Marxist nihilistic anarchist.

12:18.497 --> 12:22.376
He joined a large insurance company
and got a parking space.

12:25.897 --> 12:27.649
Wooh! Yeah!

12:27.817 --> 12:30.456
Rock and roll! Thank you very much.

12:30.617 --> 12:34.087
For those who are interested,
there are official T-shirts

12:34.257 --> 12:37.772
and signed Polaroids on sale
in the back of Dobbin's car.

12:37.937 --> 12:41.930
It's the orange Ford
with the bald tyres and no windscreen.

12:42.097 --> 12:44.975
We'll be back in 20 minutes, so from me, Smeg,

12:45.137 --> 12:48.925
and from Dobbin and Gazza, the Heads,
I'll see you later.

12:49.137 --> 12:51.697
I'll catch you guys later.

12:51.857 --> 12:54.530
- What is this place?
- It's a pub.

12:54.737 --> 12:56.807
"Pub". Ah, yes. A meeting place

12:56.977 --> 13:00.970
where people attempt to achieve
advanced states of mental incompetence

13:01.137 --> 13:04.368
by the repeated consumption
of fermented vegetable drinks.

13:04.577 --> 13:09.048
Guys, guys. I'd like you to meet me, aged 17.

13:09.217 --> 13:14.245
Sha-dy! This is totally shady.
It's beyond shady, it's surreal.

13:14.417 --> 13:18.854
- These your mates, then?
- Yeah. That's Cat, Kryten, and...Rimmer.

13:19.017 --> 13:21.656
Brilliant tattoo!
What's it stand for? Heavy metal?

13:21.817 --> 13:24.889
- Yes, indeed.
- And what's happened to his face?!

13:25.057 --> 13:28.288
It's grotesque, isn't it?
Has he had an accident?

13:28.457 --> 13:32.928
He looks like he had his head
jammed in a lift. It's totally shady!

13:33.137 --> 13:35.253
Just sit down and shut up.

13:35.417 --> 13:38.807
- So, what do you want?
- I've come to change our future.

13:38.977 --> 13:43.175
Aren't you happy being a rock star?
Those groupies getting you down?

13:43.377 --> 13:47.416
- We don't make it as a rock star.
- That's impossible. It cannot be.

13:47.617 --> 13:52.407
How can I put this?
You don't make it 'cause...you're crap.

13:53.897 --> 13:57.412
How would you know, grandad?
You're too old for what we transmit.

13:57.577 --> 14:01.013
- I'm you, you dork!
- Too old and too crypto-fascist.

14:01.177 --> 14:04.089
Will you shut up? I'm trying to make you rich.

14:04.257 --> 14:08.535
Just go down to the patent office
and register this as your invention.

14:08.697 --> 14:11.769
- It's called a tension sheet.
- Uh-uh. That's immoral.

14:11.937 --> 14:14.656
- That's Thickie Holden's invention.
- Uh-uh. Was.

14:14.857 --> 14:18.406
This is just packing stuff,
painted red with writing on it.

14:18.577 --> 14:21.569
- I know.
- It's crypto-fascist bourgeois crap.

14:21.777 --> 14:24.655
It'll make you a multi-multi-multi-millionaire.

14:24.817 --> 14:27.456
But I'm not into dosh. I loathe possessions.

14:27.657 --> 14:30.490
It's just so...so crypto-fascist.

14:30.657 --> 14:35.253
Stop saying everything's crypto-fascist!
You make me sound like a complete git!

14:36.777 --> 14:39.655
I'm not breaking up the band. Music is me life.

14:39.857 --> 14:44.692
He's right. He can't give up his music.
You heard "Om". It's a masterpiece!

14:46.057 --> 14:49.652
- See?
- Back off. I'm giving you a break.

14:49.857 --> 14:52.325
Oh, give up. The guy's an idiot.

14:52.537 --> 14:55.256
- He's me!
- Exactly.

14:57.097 --> 15:00.453
I don't want a break. I'll take me own chances.

15:00.657 --> 15:05.651
If you do, you'll be stuck on a spaceship
with them for the rest of eternity.

15:05.817 --> 15:10.413
You won't have a future.
You think about it. C'mon.

15:12.017 --> 15:15.168
You haven't got a copy of "Om", have you?

15:15.337 --> 15:17.453
- They're in the car.
- What a pity.

15:17.657 --> 15:21.047
I just can't get it out of my head. Om...

15:21.217 --> 15:23.208
Keep writing those hits, kid.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.412
What a nice guy!

15:33.497 --> 15:35.533
What now?

15:35.737 --> 15:40.413
Once the timelines sort themselves out,
we'll see if it's worked.

15:40.617 --> 15:42.812
It's happening! I'm disappearing!

15:49.337 --> 15:52.090
- What happened?
- Lister altered the timelines

15:52.257 --> 15:54.612
and lived an entirely different life.

15:54.777 --> 15:58.292
He didn't join Red Dwarf,
so the Cat race never existed

15:58.457 --> 16:02.245
and we never rescued Kryten,
so they've disappeared, too.

16:02.417 --> 16:05.090
- So it's just you and me?
- For eternity.

16:05.297 --> 16:08.687
No, thanks! Find him and bring him back.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.968
- Anything?
- Got him.

16:20.137 --> 16:24.528
- And?
- Tension sheet. Inventor, D Lister, 17.

16:24.737 --> 16:29.253
- Damn!
- He died in a plane crash, aged 98.

16:29.457 --> 16:31.493
- 98?!
- His own fault, apparently.

16:31.657 --> 16:35.650
He was making love to his 14th wife
and lost control of the plane.

16:37.017 --> 16:40.566
- Have you got any photographs?
- Not of that, no.

16:41.777 --> 16:44.371
No, so I can bring him back.

16:44.577 --> 16:47.410
There's one picture reference,
but you won't like it.

16:51.697 --> 16:53.972
- <i>Heeeeeere's Blaize</i>
- Hello.

16:54.417 --> 16:58.012
Welcome to "Lifestyles
of the Disgustingly Rich and Famous."

16:58.177 --> 17:02.693
Tonight, we look at the world's youngest
billionaire, Dave "Tension Sheet" Lister.

17:02.857 --> 17:05.530
Behind me, Mr Lister's English mansion.

17:05.696 --> 17:08.336
He had the whole building
transported brick by brick

17:08.497 --> 17:12.205
from down the road,
just to get away from the neighbours.

17:12.377 --> 17:16.086
Now that's the kind of cash
that opens anybody's legs.

17:16.257 --> 17:19.089
The gravel in his drive
came from Buckingham Palace.

17:19.257 --> 17:23.170
Dave bought Buck Palace and had it
ground down just to line his drive.

17:23.337 --> 17:29.048
This man has a wad so thick,
you could use it to beat whales to death.

17:29.217 --> 17:33.005
He calls his home "Xanadu",
not in reference to "Citizen Kane",

17:33.177 --> 17:38.297
but as tribute to the hit single
by Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich.

17:38.457 --> 17:41.017
But Dave has musical aspirations of his own.

17:41.177 --> 17:44.487
Only last year, his first single, "Om",
shot to Number One

17:44.657 --> 17:47.808
when he personally purchased
three million copies.

17:47.977 --> 17:51.128
You'll never be short of an ashtray
in his house.

17:51.297 --> 17:56.371
Like many people who have everything,
Dave's life has been tinged with tragedy.

17:56.537 --> 18:00.052
Well, actually, it hasn't, but we can only hope.

18:00.217 --> 18:04.051
Now Dr Bob Porkman, father of the condom
that calls you back...

18:04.297 --> 18:06.288
Freeze. I've seen enough.

18:06.497 --> 18:09.409
- What do you want to do?
- I'm going in.

18:09.577 --> 18:12.296
- I'm going in to rescue him.
- Rescue him?

18:13.777 --> 18:17.611
It's my duty.
My duty as a complete and utter bastard.

18:42.577 --> 18:44.249
Yow!

18:46.617 --> 18:50.007
Mr Lister, sir. What a delight
it is to welcome you home.

18:50.217 --> 18:52.970
Gilbert, my man! You're looking bad, baby!

18:53.177 --> 18:58.774
- Indeed, sir.
- You're my main, main, main, main man!

19:08.977 --> 19:11.730
I am awfully sorry about the statue, sir.

19:11.897 --> 19:14.411
The contractors
still haven't devised a way

19:14.577 --> 19:17.410
of making it urinate champagne
into the courtyard,

19:17.577 --> 19:21.695
although I am assured that
it will be functional for the royal visit.

19:22.537 --> 19:25.893
Oh, get outta town! This is gonna slay 'em.

19:26.097 --> 19:30.249
Indeed, sir. I am only just recovering
from the hilarity of the gag myself.

19:31.377 --> 19:34.767
Almost Swiftian in its rapier-like subtlety.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.685
I told Daddy today. About us, I mean.

19:47.897 --> 19:51.970
- How did the old codger take it?
- Not terribly well, actually.

19:52.137 --> 19:56.892
He perched on top of his clay pigeon
launcher and shouted, "Pull!"

19:59.617 --> 20:01.653
For madam, Lobster a la Grecque.

20:01.817 --> 20:06.288
For sir, a sausage and onion gravy
sandwich on white bread

20:06.457 --> 20:09.335
with a glass of sterilised milk.

20:09.497 --> 20:12.807
Brilliant. We lived on these
when I was in the band.

20:12.977 --> 20:18.097
As requested, sir, it was helicoptered in
from Luigi's Fish 'n' Chip Emporium.

20:18.297 --> 20:21.016
An artist beyond comparison, sir.

20:22.977 --> 20:28.005
Excuse me, sir, but a gentleman appears
to have appeared in the room.

20:29.097 --> 20:32.214
Listy, it's me. It's me, Rimmer.

20:32.897 --> 20:38.654
Rimmsy. Arnie Rimmer. Arnie.
Old Iron Balls. Rimmer. Rimmer!

20:38.857 --> 20:41.576
Apparently,
the gentleman's name is Rimmer, sir.

20:41.777 --> 20:45.895
- Have we met?
- Have we met? We're like brothers.

20:46.057 --> 20:48.446
We were shipmates. Red Dwarf.

20:49.937 --> 20:52.405
- You don't remember, do you?
- Remember what?

20:52.577 --> 20:55.330
Of course. It hasn't happened, has it?

20:55.497 --> 20:59.126
- What hasn't happened?
- Sabrina Mulholland-JJones!

20:59.297 --> 21:01.492
- Yes?
- THE Sabrina Mulholland-JJones?

21:01.697 --> 21:04.894
Model, best-selling novelist
and international jet-setter?

21:05.057 --> 21:07.048
Yeah. She's me bird.

21:07.217 --> 21:09.208
"She's me bird."

21:09.377 --> 21:12.926
You call the Duke of Lincoln's
eldest daughter "me bird"?

21:13.137 --> 21:15.890
Gilbert, escort Mr Rumour to the door?

21:16.057 --> 21:19.652
- But I came here to save you.
- Throw him out, Gilbert. He's a nutter.

21:19.817 --> 21:23.253
- Step this way, sir.
- But we were friends, buddies!

21:23.417 --> 21:25.806
Let's not have a scene, sir.

21:25.977 --> 21:30.892
You call this happiness? Surrounded
by toadying lackeys and paid sycophants?

21:31.057 --> 21:34.891
Living with a love goddess sex-bomb?
You call this contentment?

21:35.097 --> 21:40.296
You know, I look at the two of us
and I ask one simple question...

21:40.457 --> 21:44.086
Who is the rich man? You, with your 58 houses,

21:44.257 --> 21:46.452
your private island in the Bahamas,

21:46.617 --> 21:48.892
your multi-billion-pound business empire,

21:49.057 --> 21:54.370
or me with... with...with what I've got.

21:57.777 --> 22:00.132
It's you, isn't it?

22:00.297 --> 22:03.767
Yes, it's all clear to me now.
You...richer and happier.

22:04.377 --> 22:06.368
This way, sir.

22:07.977 --> 22:12.971
I should have thought a bit harder
about that speech. I cocked it up a bit.

22:16.217 --> 22:19.254
- Any luck?
- Useless.

22:19.417 --> 22:21.533
Didn't listen. Didn't even recognise me.

22:21.697 --> 22:24.575
He just thought
I was some deranged madman.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.813
You sure he didn't recognise you?

22:27.017 --> 22:31.966
Wait a tension-popping minute.
If Lister can do it, why can't I?

22:32.177 --> 22:37.012
These photographs, there's one here of me
at boarding school, aged eight.

22:37.177 --> 22:40.374
I can invent the tension sheet first.

22:40.577 --> 22:43.216
But you'll disappear
and become incredibly wealthy,

22:43.377 --> 22:45.572
and Lister will be sent hurtling back.

22:46.057 --> 22:49.288
Yes, and Cat and Kryten
will be brought back into existence.

22:49.497 --> 22:51.772
True, as a by-product, I'll become mega-rich

22:51.937 --> 22:55.725
and be forced to have constant sex
with that JJones woman,

22:55.897 --> 22:58.411
but that's a sacrifice I'm prepared to make.

23:01.017 --> 23:02.928
Holly, torch.

23:20.537 --> 23:24.769
- Pssst! Wake up.
- What is it?

23:25.177 --> 23:28.169
- Who are you?
- Look, don't be afraid.

23:28.337 --> 23:30.567
I'm going to make you rich.

23:30.737 --> 23:34.332
All you've got to do
is listen very, very carefully.

23:35.657 --> 23:40.253
Right, this is the plan. You will invent
a thing called the tension sheet.

23:40.417 --> 23:42.692
- Pension sheet?
- T. T. Tension.

23:42.857 --> 23:44.927
Tension sheet. Shut up. I'm talking.

23:46.297 --> 23:50.131
Are you listening? They're sheets
of paper with air bubbles in them.

23:50.297 --> 23:55.007
- Like you get in packing paper?
- Look, Holden, go back to sleep.

23:55.897 --> 24:01.813
They're exactly the same as the ones
in packing paper, but you paint them red.

24:01.977 --> 24:04.366
- Why red?
- Because it helps people relax.

24:04.657 --> 24:07.012
Shut up. I'm trying to make him rich.

24:08.737 --> 24:12.013
You'd write better
if you took off your boxing gloves.

24:13.577 --> 24:16.045
- Now, have you got all that?
- I think so.

24:16.217 --> 24:19.129
First thing tomorrow,
take the idea to the patent office.

24:19.297 --> 24:24.530
I can't. Not first thing. I've got extra
rugby practice because I'm so wet.

24:27.057 --> 24:29.855
All right, lunchtime.
Take it at lunchtime, OK?

24:30.737 --> 24:32.807
I've got to go now.

24:34.977 --> 24:37.935
Oi. Don't mess this up.

24:38.137 --> 24:40.128
No, sir.

24:45.057 --> 24:48.572
Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

24:51.897 --> 24:55.128
- Worked, did it?
- Though it pains me dearly,

24:55.297 --> 24:58.846
I'll be having to say ta-ta to your gormless face.

24:59.057 --> 25:01.617
Ta-ta, poverty. Ta-ta, failure.

25:01.777 --> 25:05.326
Hello, Sabrina. Hello, sexual ecstasy.

25:05.777 --> 25:09.326
A-ha. Here they come, bang on time.

25:09.497 --> 25:13.888
Well, gentlemen, just enough time
for me to say toodly-pipski.

25:14.057 --> 25:17.288
- I'll disappear any moment now.
- What happened?

25:18.217 --> 25:21.254
Here it comes... Any moment.

25:21.857 --> 25:24.052
What's he talking about?

25:24.977 --> 25:29.255
Any moment... Any moment now.

25:30.857 --> 25:35.009
It hasn't worked. According to our data,
you didn't invent the tension sheet.

25:35.177 --> 25:38.169
It was invented by a gentleman
named "Thickie" Holden.

25:38.977 --> 25:42.367
- What?
- You've put things back as they were.

25:44.177 --> 25:46.611
Why does nothing ever go right for me?

25:46.777 --> 25:50.247
Every time I get so much
as a snifter of a break,

25:50.417 --> 25:54.968
a glimpse of happiness, something
inexplicably cruel and horrible happens,

25:55.137 --> 25:58.174
- and it blows up in my face.
- Hang on.

25:58.337 --> 26:02.535
Something is different.
Somehow, you're no longer a hologram.

26:02.697 --> 26:05.291
- You're alive.
- What?

26:11.977 --> 26:13.968
I'm alive!

26:14.297 --> 26:15.969
I'm alive!

26:16.137 --> 26:18.014
Mmmm!

26:18.177 --> 26:20.168
I'm alive!

26:20.857 --> 26:25.647
Kryten, unpack Rachel
and get out the puncture repair kit.

26:25.817 --> 26:28.206
I'm alive!

26:32.177 --> 26:36.011
I'm alive. I can touch, I can feel, I can fondle.

26:36.177 --> 26:39.328
I'm alive! Don't you think
it's incredible? I am ali...

26:44.697 --> 26:46.688
What was he saying?

26:47.305 --> 26:53.304
