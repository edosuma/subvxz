WEBVTT

00:20.603 --> 00:22.939
DANIEL: JUAN CARLOS KNOWS WE MET.
I DIDN'T TELL HIM…

00:23.023 --> 00:25.108
MISSED CALLS: CYNTHIA AND JORGE

00:28.111 --> 00:30.321
SEE YOU TONIGHT… JUAN CARLOS

00:35.910 --> 00:38.621
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:39.099 --> 01:40.266
Hey!

01:40.850 --> 01:42.185
You're back from the dead!

01:42.685 --> 01:44.312
Can you tell me what happened?

01:44.395 --> 01:46.940
Three words: "Soldado del Amor."

01:48.233 --> 01:50.235
You fell. I took you to the ER.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.237
It was the damn mushrooms.

01:52.737 --> 01:55.573
-I don't know what came over me.
-You got so existential.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.659
You insisted you were going to die.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.871
Is everything all right?

02:05.500 --> 02:06.668
No, I'm not okay.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.839
They found a lump in my breast.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.135
There's no diagnosis yet, but…

02:16.219 --> 02:18.805
I have to get a biopsy to rule out cancer.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.059
Oh, Mariana, I don't know…

02:24.394 --> 02:26.646
I feel like my life is falling apart.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.441
I don't know what'll happen
to my marriage or my life.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.196
You know I'm here for you, don't you?

02:35.780 --> 02:37.740
-Huh?
-Thanks.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.202
Thanks for being here.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.878
Well, life goes on, right?
See you in a while.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.462
Where are you going?

02:52.547 --> 02:53.756
To get the biopsy done.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.551
I'll come with you.

02:56.634 --> 02:57.594
-Really?
-Yeah.

02:58.386 --> 02:59.262
Come on.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.230
What's up with you?

03:09.856 --> 03:11.816
Hi, I'm also thrilled to see you.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.067
What do you want?

03:14.277 --> 03:16.362
Words of comfort
after blowing it with Mariana?

03:17.614 --> 03:18.448
No.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.492
Actually, I have a proposition.

03:22.744 --> 03:26.289
Imagine seeing him every day
knowing full well I'm lying.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.332
I just can't.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.251
Some people can, not me.

03:33.046 --> 03:33.963
Ana Servín?

03:35.715 --> 03:37.842
Go on. I'll be with you all the way.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.266
The crooked floor
is merely an optical illusion.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.561
Oh! We can set up
a play area for Regina over there.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.271
And…

03:50.355 --> 03:54.525
Pablo and I worked it out
and we'll be sharing that room.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.527
On one condition…

03:57.362 --> 03:58.947
I get my own bathroom.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.784
-What else?
-That room over there is yours.

04:05.453 --> 04:06.955
Hang on a minute.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.668
You rented an apartment
for the four of us?

04:11.751 --> 04:12.877
-Yeah.
-Yes.

04:12.961 --> 04:13.795
Why?

04:15.213 --> 04:16.756
We wanted to surprise you.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.383
Surprise!

04:19.384 --> 04:21.552
You don't have to choose
between us anymore.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.430
Why didn't you ask me first?

04:27.392 --> 04:29.185
Because Pablo is an idiot!

04:29.269 --> 04:31.312
But I'm the bigger idiot
for listening to him.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.022
Here I am, renting an apartment.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.984
-You said it was a cool idea!
-It is a cool idea.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.486
But I'm no longer
moving out of Ana's place.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.029
-Why?
-Why?

04:40.613 --> 04:42.282
You don't want to leave Valentina.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.909
It's not that.
Ana needs me more than ever.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.744
I can't turn my back on her now.

04:48.705 --> 04:49.914
I'm sorry.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.503
Why wasn't the trip postponed?

04:56.087 --> 04:57.171
I'm sorry, Ana.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.215
It was the CEO's decision.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.717
Those are my clients, Jorge!

05:01.843 --> 05:03.428
You could've looped me in.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.888
-Ana, is everything okay?
-No, it's not okay.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.558
I don't like
the way this trip was handled.

05:08.641 --> 05:13.187
Ana, a machine can't stop working
because one of its cogs fell off.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.565
I'm very sorry
about what you're going through.

05:17.483 --> 05:20.403
-I had to tell him, sorry.
-We can't wait for you.

05:20.903 --> 05:23.239
I think you understand what I'm saying.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.209
Very well, then.
You'll have my resignation tomorrow.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.935
I slept with Daniel
when I went to Buenos Aires.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.776
I spent the night in the hospital
after a fight with Daniel.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.113
As luck would have it,
I got the bed next to yours.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.825
I heard you telling the nurses
about your affair in Argentina.

06:08.951 --> 06:12.080
I expected you to deny it,
to say none of it was true.

06:13.664 --> 06:16.167
I could've done that, but to what end?

06:17.460 --> 06:18.836
I'd be fooling myself.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.550
The affair made me realize
our marriage isn't well.

06:24.634 --> 06:25.593
No, it's not.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.804
But we can still fix it.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.856
You're leaving, just like that?

06:38.940 --> 06:41.025
You're giving up 20 years of marriage?

06:41.526 --> 06:43.319
Are you sure it's on me?

06:50.785 --> 06:51.869
Cheers!

06:51.953 --> 06:56.666
Because I don't know how it happened,
but we ended up living together.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.584
It's funny, right?

07:02.505 --> 07:05.675
-What's up, bro? You took long enough.
-Hey, man!

07:05.758 --> 07:07.427
-Dude!
-Hi, how are you?

07:07.510 --> 07:10.430
-Fine.
-Hey, the place looks nice.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.683
The floor's a bit warped, though.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.310
-So, which one is my room?
-You don't get one.

07:17.019 --> 07:19.647
This place has to be ready
for whenever Regina comes.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.358
That's a dick move, man.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.735
Cheers, congratulations.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.237
Cool.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.828
I need someone to talk to.

07:34.328 --> 07:36.164
-You got the wrong door.
-No.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.500
I'm sorry! So sorry!

07:40.001 --> 07:41.377
It was your fault.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.587
Look at this.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.304
-Will the boss join us?
-He already left.

07:51.387 --> 07:54.640
-I didn't hear him.
-Because you were still asleep.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.560
That's odd. Dad never leaves before eight.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.437
Enough already, okay? Enough.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.273
Is this an interrogation or what?

08:05.943 --> 08:08.654
Your dad went away on a trip,
he's meeting a supplier.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.498
This is a comfy couch.

08:20.458 --> 08:23.377
Don't even think you can stay here longer.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.507
Will you tell me
what your fight with Ana is about?

08:29.884 --> 08:31.552
She slept with someone else.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.470
Really?

08:36.432 --> 08:38.935
-Did you tell her about us?
-No.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.436
I didn't have the guts.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.733
I'm a coward, aren't I?

08:49.737 --> 08:52.114
Hey, I know coming here was a bad idea,

08:52.198 --> 08:55.368
but when Ana told me what she did,
I got so jealous…

08:58.371 --> 09:01.374
and I felt the need to see you
and talk to you.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.376
It's called "spite."

09:05.336 --> 09:06.587
I hope you feel better now.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.556
I'll leave now.

09:17.306 --> 09:18.766
Sorry for bothering you.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.035
What the hell?

09:38.536 --> 09:40.997
If you won't help, go snore at your place.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.041
-I thought we were done.
-Do I have a job?

09:44.125 --> 09:46.794
I don't, do I? So, we're not done.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.380
Mariana, we've sent
your resume to a bunch of places.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.424
Wait to hear back from them.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.554
Besides, why do you need a job
if you're staying here?

09:56.637 --> 09:58.389
Because I need to save up.

09:58.472 --> 10:01.559
I want to go back to college
without asking my mom for money.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.520
ANA ADDED YOU TO "CHRISTENING" BOARD

10:05.396 --> 10:06.731
What the hell?

10:11.152 --> 10:12.153
What is that?

10:12.778 --> 10:16.115
It's supposed to be a centerpiece,
but it looks like…

10:17.825 --> 10:18.659
A dildo?

10:19.243 --> 10:20.953
Why christen them?

10:21.829 --> 10:23.414
So they don't go to limbo.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.207
Limbo?

10:25.291 --> 10:28.878
If you don't believe in this anyway,
what's the harm in doing it?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.921
Why do it if I don't believe in it?

10:31.005 --> 10:33.966
Shouldn't we let them decide
when they're older?

10:35.217 --> 10:36.594
What if I'm gone by then?

10:37.678 --> 10:41.390
We agreed we'd stay positive
until you get the test results.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.934
Yeah, but I have to be realistic.

10:45.353 --> 10:48.981
If I'm dying, I don't want to waste
whatever time I have left.

10:49.065 --> 10:52.943
So, organizing a christening
isn't wasting time for you?

10:53.027 --> 10:55.488
If you object for religious reasons,
I understand.

10:55.571 --> 10:57.406
But at least do it for the girls.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.867
Ana, they're seven months old.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.078
Ceci and Rodrigo are both christened.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.706
Vale will think
I skipped hers because her father left.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.792
That will scar her for life.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.753
Fine, you can christen
Valentina but not Regina.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.672
Leave her out of it, okay? Please.

11:12.755 --> 11:16.342
How will I explain
to Regina why she was left out?

11:16.425 --> 11:17.843
Just blame it on me.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.721
I'll blame you when Valentina asks

11:20.805 --> 11:24.350
why you chose
these horrible dildos as centerpieces.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.811
They're not dildos! They're beautiful.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.063
-Ana…
-They're cute.

11:29.146 --> 11:33.275
-Let's do a rock, paper, scissors.
-No, wait. I have a better idea.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.447
Yes, we're having
a welcoming ritual for Regina

11:38.531 --> 11:40.616
and a christening ceremony for Valentina.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.451
Something more spiritual for her.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.371
Mom, I didn't call you
to get your opinion.

11:45.454 --> 11:48.958
No, my mom doesn't know.
So, don't bring it up, Grandma.

11:49.041 --> 11:52.253
Juan Carlos left.
And no, not with his secretary.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.632
Yeah, we've all changed a lot.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.301
They're asking about you.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.721
I couldn't say when you'd be back.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.768
You'll never forgive me, huh?

12:09.770 --> 12:11.480
It's not that easy.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.358
I know, I get it.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.487
I'd be lost if I were in your shoes.

12:27.204 --> 12:29.331
I don't know how I could do this to you.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.294
Especially since you've never cheated.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.259
Think of the children.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.053
Give me a few days.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.182
I need space to clear my head.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.018
I swear she's always like that.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.812
Yes, she's very responsible
and hardworking.

12:53.647 --> 12:54.857
Yes, all right, I…

12:54.940 --> 12:56.942
I'll call you back next week.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.403
-Thanks.
-What was that about?

13:00.905 --> 13:04.283
I'm trying to help Mariana find a job.
She wants to go back to college.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.458
If you still have feelings for Mariana,
just tell her.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.295
Frankly, I'm still in love with her.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.339
I want to make her happy.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.091
-So, what's the problem?
-Well…

13:21.675 --> 13:22.927
She doesn't want me.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.804
Did you ask her?

13:26.430 --> 13:29.850
You have an actual shot with her.
You have a baby together.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.945
I want the event to be small.

13:41.028 --> 13:44.156
With around 50 guests or so.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.159
-That's a lot, Ana!
-Plus your guests, of course.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.162
-Did you e-mail me your list?
-Here's my list.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.332
My grandma, Anuar, Elena and Pablo.

13:53.415 --> 13:54.500
What about your mom?

13:54.583 --> 13:58.045
-Aren't you inviting her?
-No. We're not on good terms.

13:58.879 --> 13:59.755
Mariana…

13:59.839 --> 14:02.299
-Is Juan Carlos coming?
-Of course he is.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.387
Even if he's mad at me,
it's his daughter's christening.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.931
Your mom can't miss
her grandkid's christening.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.641
She won't be offended, seriously.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.768
If you won't invite her, I will.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.520
-I'll call her.
-No, Ana…

14:15.563 --> 14:17.106
Fine, I'll invite her.

14:19.733 --> 14:22.736
It's very important to me
that your family is there.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.906
After you and Tere, I'd say you're even.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.325
Even? Don't be ridiculous, Víctor.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.451
-What, bro?
-Thanks.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.828
You had a fling with Tere.

14:31.328 --> 14:34.039
And Ana cheated on you with her ex.
That makes you even.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.083
Or not, because she actually confessed.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.751
So, you would've told her?

14:38.335 --> 14:41.630
No. That would be so weird.
"Guess what? I banged Regina's granny."

14:41.714 --> 14:45.551
-That's exactly what I thought.
-Besides, she'd never forgive you.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.598
It doesn't seem fair
for her to carry all the guilt.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.101
It all depends on what you want then.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.937
If you want her back, don't tell her.

14:57.438 --> 15:00.941
If you want stop being a married man
and join me in my bachelor lifestyle,

15:01.025 --> 15:01.859
then tell her.

15:02.359 --> 15:05.112
Just decide.
You can't keep up this charade forever.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.117
Do you mind
if we sit down for a little while?

15:26.592 --> 15:28.218
I know I screwed up big time.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.304
And that I hurt you.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.140
But I want us to be together.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.893
I swear I've changed
and that I'm willing to do…

15:35.976 --> 15:38.354
-No. Pablo.
-Wait. I'm not done yet.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.565
I want you to go back to college.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.653
I'll take care of the money,
the baby, the house.

15:45.736 --> 15:48.489
You wouldn't need a job, I'd support you.

15:48.572 --> 15:49.740
Pablo, wait.

15:51.867 --> 15:52.701
No.

15:53.577 --> 15:54.578
Why?

15:55.537 --> 15:56.997
Listen. Sit down.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.960
I'm not who I used to be.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.753
And I don't know what I want.

16:03.253 --> 16:07.299
But I do know I'm not looking
for someone to support me financially.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.551
You don't have to say yes right now.

16:09.635 --> 16:10.636
I can wait.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.847
I don't want you to wait for me.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.392
Mariana, you're the coolest girl I know.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.395
The only one
I could ever spend my life with.

16:19.979 --> 16:20.813
I mean it.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.273
With whom I have the cutest babies.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.612
I'm not in love with you anymore.

16:32.032 --> 16:32.950
Sorry.

16:34.702 --> 16:38.122
I wish I felt the same way as you,
but I just don't.

16:45.754 --> 16:46.839
Jeez, Mariana.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.260
I'm tired of doing all this,
of doing everything for you,

16:52.261 --> 16:53.178
for us.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.485
Dad?

17:11.447 --> 17:12.865
Who knows what'll happen?

17:13.490 --> 17:15.617
Pablo might not come after all.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.327
What do you mean?

17:17.953 --> 17:19.955
At this rate,
you'll end up with no guests.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.291
Have you called your mom?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.043
I have. One more photo.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.545
-Look over here.
-I know you didn't want to do it.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.923
-Thank you.
-Sure.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.384
Look how cute they look together.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.763
Oh, they're so cute!

17:35.846 --> 17:37.890
But Vale has a hint of a double chin.

17:37.973 --> 17:39.349
Can't you edit that?

17:39.433 --> 17:41.977
Ana, she's a baby.
Babies have cute double chins.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.104
Still, you should touch it up.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.649
-Let's just take another one.
-Chin up, sweetie.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.069
Hi, Mom. Hi, Mariana.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.820
Look who's back from his trip.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.200
You better tell us what's going on.

17:56.283 --> 17:59.453
Because this seems
like a bad Kardashians episode.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.332
You're splitting up?

18:03.832 --> 18:06.877
Listen, kids.
Couples go through rough patches.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.880
Yes, but that doesn't mean
we don't love each other

18:10.380 --> 18:12.549
or that we no longer love you.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.259
I bet my dad cheated on you.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.385
No, Ceci.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.097
In fact…

18:18.180 --> 18:20.682
What your mom wants to say…

18:21.391 --> 18:23.477
is not all couples
split up because of that.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.479
Sometimes we neglect our partner--

18:25.562 --> 18:26.480
No, Dad.

18:26.563 --> 18:28.690
We don't need the details.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.653
I don't want you to split up.

18:33.529 --> 18:34.488
It's all right, Ro.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.573
We'll get through this for you.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.122
And for us.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.341
What's up, man?

18:54.424 --> 18:55.425
Hey, dude!

18:57.678 --> 18:58.554
What's all this?

18:59.346 --> 19:00.848
A little testosterone.

19:01.348 --> 19:04.852
It might help
ease the pain of your rejection.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.355
It's not like Mariana rejected me
to get back with you.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.149
I guess not.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.943
I got rejected a while back.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.445
But I'll get wasted anyway.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.281
That's what I'm talking about!

19:17.364 --> 19:18.198
Thanks.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.454
Ever since you moved out,
none of these shitheads

19:24.538 --> 19:25.873
want to clean the bathroom.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.332
Fuck, man!

19:27.416 --> 19:28.250
Anyway…

19:28.333 --> 19:30.544
This is my cousin, Cynthia.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.921
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.631
-Sorry!
-It's okay.

19:35.132 --> 19:38.051
Don't worry about it.
Why don't you stay and play?

19:39.178 --> 19:42.139
I already beat everyone, they all suck.

19:43.390 --> 19:44.766
You play video games?

19:44.850 --> 19:47.144
-Yes.
-Very nice.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.479
-You don't?
-Of course I do.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.199
Photo.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.833
MARIANA: HEY, PABLO!

20:14.171 --> 20:17.507
SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN…

20:21.595 --> 20:22.721
I feel awful.

20:24.097 --> 20:26.225
I'll never stop feeling guilty.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.142
Ana, don't.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.065
Thank you.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.275
What for?

20:35.359 --> 20:37.945
For trying to make it work
despite everything.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.573
I can only imagine
how hard this must be for you.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.867
But I promise you…

20:45.994 --> 20:46.828
I swear…

20:47.371 --> 20:50.207
I'll earn your trust back.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.625
I also cheated.

20:55.587 --> 20:56.421
What?

21:01.176 --> 21:02.594
Before or after I did?

21:02.678 --> 21:03.553
Before.

21:04.304 --> 21:06.056
I didn't know how to tell you.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.815
Why didn't you tell me when I confessed?

21:14.898 --> 21:16.233
I was a coward. I…

21:16.316 --> 21:18.443
You judged me, made me feel like shit.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.363
You let me blame myself
for ruining our marriage.

21:21.446 --> 21:24.283
-Forgive me. I was an idiot. Ana.
-Who is she?

21:24.783 --> 21:26.410
Do I know her? What's her name?

21:26.493 --> 21:29.579
No. Wait.
Let's not get into that, there's no need.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.081
There's no need to… Ana.

21:32.207 --> 21:33.292
Ana!

21:33.792 --> 21:35.168
What about the christening?

21:57.316 --> 21:59.359
TWO WEEKS LATER

21:59.443 --> 22:04.781
Maternity is an intimate,
life-changing event for a woman.

22:05.282 --> 22:07.034
In every culture,

22:07.117 --> 22:09.119
maternity rituals

22:09.202 --> 22:12.497
have always been presided by women.

22:12.998 --> 22:19.087
Through this circle, we'll bless
the female lineage of this family.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.214
Sorry I'm late. Sorry.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.674
Thanks.

22:23.425 --> 22:27.220
Yesterday I told her to get here early.
She said she had no clue about this.

22:27.804 --> 22:28.805
Isn't it strange?

22:31.892 --> 22:32.726
Okay.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.728
We're all here.

22:35.395 --> 22:37.314
Place your hands like this.

22:37.397 --> 22:41.276
The right one receives,
the left one gives.

22:42.444 --> 22:47.115
Let's invoke the female deities.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.160
-This is heresy.
-Thank you.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.830
Ana, Mariana.

22:53.914 --> 22:57.250
Let's strengthen the bond between you.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.336
Hold hands.

23:01.254 --> 23:03.799
Tell each other
what you admire about one another.

23:06.134 --> 23:09.346
I'm very grateful for finding you.

23:10.138 --> 23:11.765
I'm very lucky.

23:12.349 --> 23:15.811
It scared me at first
that you were Regina's mom because…

23:17.062 --> 23:20.941
I didn't agree with the way
you led your life, so free, so…

23:21.441 --> 23:22.734
careless.

23:23.402 --> 23:26.405
But now I realize
I'd like to be a bit more like that,

23:27.322 --> 23:29.991
and stop making
those mistakes I've made for…

23:30.534 --> 23:31.785
being the way I am.

23:32.953 --> 23:37.124
Very few people know me as well as you do
and know everything about me.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.170
I consider you my best friend.

23:44.548 --> 23:45.674
Mariana.

23:46.341 --> 23:49.302
Thanks for all the things
you've taught me, Ana.

23:50.303 --> 23:55.058
I must confess I was also very nervous
about you being Valentina's mom.

23:55.809 --> 23:56.852
But…

23:56.935 --> 24:00.480
sharing motherhood
with you has been amazing.

24:01.356 --> 24:04.901
I've learned a lot from you
about what it means to be a mom,

24:05.527 --> 24:09.364
about being true to what I think and feel.

24:10.490 --> 24:13.076
It's important for me that you know

24:13.160 --> 24:16.496
that I will always be there
for you and for our babies,

24:16.580 --> 24:18.248
no matter what. Okay?

24:20.417 --> 24:22.002
Thanks for being my partner.

24:24.296 --> 24:27.591
Like that, with your eyes closed,

24:28.175 --> 24:31.720
feel how the energy flows.

24:49.529 --> 24:51.907
It seems there's not enough tables.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.409
-What about your 50 guests?
-I uninvited them.

24:54.993 --> 24:55.911
You were right.

24:55.994 --> 24:59.206
With what's going on with Juan Carlos,
I wanted to avoid the gossip.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.958
So, I decided to keep it small,
family only.

25:04.753 --> 25:05.795
Alma Toca?

25:06.505 --> 25:07.923
Small and family-only?

25:08.507 --> 25:11.801
If I didn't invite her,
she'd gossip about me even more.

25:12.385 --> 25:13.512
I'll be right back.

25:14.554 --> 25:17.307
Hi! I'm so glad you made it.

25:22.604 --> 25:23.772
You're too obvious.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.943
-What are you talking about?
-Don't play dumb, Mariana.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.111
I know why you rejected Pablo.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.324
You're in love with Mrs. Perfect.

25:35.575 --> 25:37.202
What you feel isn't real love.

25:37.285 --> 25:39.663
You're just confused.

25:43.792 --> 25:46.169
Ana, can we talk?

25:46.670 --> 25:48.171
Not now, Juan Carlos, later.

25:48.672 --> 25:49.714
Later, when?

25:50.257 --> 25:52.717
You haven't talked to me
since you kicked me out.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.886
This isn't the best time.

25:55.971 --> 26:00.183
Be careful. Stay away from the holy water.
You might catch fire.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.269
Oh, wait, Father.

26:02.352 --> 26:03.478
How dare you show up?

26:03.562 --> 26:06.314
They're my grandkids,
you can't deny me this right.

26:06.398 --> 26:10.110
No, Mom. You lost it with your actions
and you dragged me along.

26:10.193 --> 26:12.362
Now, because of you, I'm going to hell.

26:13.613 --> 26:16.575
You must protect this baby
from eternal damnation.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.743
There's no such thing.

26:18.827 --> 26:22.914
Romelia, I can't christen a baby
against the parents' will.

26:22.998 --> 26:26.042
But her parents are sinners.
Their will doesn't count.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.044
-What are you doing, Mom?
-Grandma.

26:28.128 --> 26:29.921
What? She started it.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.466
She was trying to convince him
to christen Regina.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.969
-What?
-I just want to save her from hell.

26:36.052 --> 26:38.722
Hell is only in your head.

26:38.805 --> 26:41.641
No, it's in your pagan goddesses.

26:41.725 --> 26:42.976
-That's heresy.
-Enough!

26:43.059 --> 26:47.689
Since we can't do this in a civil manner,
I'm afraid you'll have to leave, Mom.

26:48.690 --> 26:51.234
-But…
-That's what fascists get.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.652
Grandma, you too.

26:52.736 --> 26:53.612
What?

26:53.695 --> 26:57.365
Neither of you can stay
unless you respect our decisions.

26:59.284 --> 27:00.285
All right.

27:01.077 --> 27:02.996
I can't believe how much you've changed.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.920
-Hello.
-Hi there.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.548
-Hello. Excuse me.
-Hello.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.549
Let's sit here.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.717
Hello, Pablo!

27:17.302 --> 27:20.055
How are you?
Your seat is in the front row.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.390
I can see fine from here.

27:24.684 --> 27:25.685
What's wrong?

27:25.769 --> 27:27.854
You didn't ask
if I wanted to christen my baby.

27:28.521 --> 27:32.317
-Pablo, I… actually--
-Forget it, Mariana.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.318
I get it.

27:33.401 --> 27:36.071
You and Ana get to make every decision.

27:36.154 --> 27:38.657
-It's fine.
-Of course not. You're Regina's dad.

27:38.740 --> 27:42.410
I don't mean to be cruel,
but I need distance between us, okay?

27:42.494 --> 27:43.995
I just want things to be clear.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.205
You got it.

27:51.544 --> 27:54.255
Don't get drunk, Víctor.
This is a christening.

27:54.339 --> 27:57.717
Easy, dude.
This orange juice isn't doing much for me.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.470
Look who's here.

28:02.013 --> 28:03.765
Sexy granny.

28:03.848 --> 28:04.724
Hey.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.354
We're gathered here today

28:09.437 --> 28:15.151
to celebrate an important day
in Regina's and Valentina's life.

28:16.236 --> 28:18.905
Welcome, brethren,
to this double celebration.

28:19.406 --> 28:22.409
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

29:16.254 --> 29:19.340
-We need to tell her the truth.
-She doesn't need to know it was you.

29:19.424 --> 29:20.967
That will only complicate things.

29:21.050 --> 29:21.926
It's for Mariana.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.219
-Why?
-She knows.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.054
Did you tell her?

29:25.138 --> 29:28.391
Of course not!
She overheard you on the phone.

29:29.392 --> 29:31.728
It's not fair
she has to keep this secret from Ana.

29:31.811 --> 29:34.647
Please understand.
You must tell her after the party.

29:34.731 --> 29:35.982
No, Tere, I can't.

29:37.525 --> 29:39.778
Juan Carlos, I've made up my mind.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.573
Either you tell her or I will. Sorry.

30:01.174 --> 30:05.512
Conrado, don't you need
to use the toilet or take a look around?

30:08.723 --> 30:10.600
I've been kicked out of worse places.

30:13.686 --> 30:14.687
Pablo.

30:15.271 --> 30:16.981
We have a daughter together.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.610
Shouldn't we make
an effort for Regina's sake?

30:21.110 --> 30:24.405
Ever since Regina was born,
that's all I've done,

30:25.240 --> 30:27.450
make an effort
for you to let me see my baby,

30:27.951 --> 30:29.744
so these people and Ana would like me.

30:31.204 --> 30:33.498
I made an effort
for you to have a place to live.

30:33.581 --> 30:35.291
I also helped you with your app.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.586
I made an effort
to make you fall in love with me again.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.256
And all for what?

30:41.965 --> 30:43.550
So you could blow me off?

30:44.175 --> 30:46.845
It's fine if you don't want to be with me.

31:03.945 --> 31:06.781
What are you looking at?
Never been cheated on?

31:12.161 --> 31:13.955
I'm also trying to quit smoking.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.582
Do those work?

31:16.165 --> 31:17.000
No.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.085
They're trash.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.046
Hey, try this.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.593
What is this? Marijuana?

31:27.760 --> 31:30.179
It's a mix of herbs I made.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.932
It helps with anxiety.

31:35.059 --> 31:37.061
And it does have marijuana.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.068
Hello.

31:44.152 --> 31:46.237
Hello, testing. Can you hear me?

31:46.321 --> 31:48.573
Welcome, friends and family.

31:48.656 --> 31:52.702
The time has come to hear
some words from the bride and groom.

31:53.411 --> 31:56.372
Bride and groom?
My bad, this is no wedding.

31:56.456 --> 32:00.209
The girls' christening
and this lovely celebration.

32:00.293 --> 32:01.669
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

32:03.212 --> 32:05.965
Thanks. Thank you all for being here.

32:06.466 --> 32:11.054
This is a very important day
for my daughters and my family.

32:11.638 --> 32:14.724
It's an honor to have you here.
I'd like to--

32:14.807 --> 32:18.227
Me! I'd like to say a few words.

32:18.728 --> 32:20.021
Come on!

32:20.104 --> 32:21.230
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

32:21.314 --> 32:22.607
Cheers to you!

32:23.399 --> 32:24.859
Thank you.

32:26.778 --> 32:27.612
Thanks…

32:27.695 --> 32:28.821
love.

32:29.572 --> 32:32.533
First things first.

32:33.076 --> 32:36.663
Welcome to this party.

32:37.246 --> 32:39.374
Thank you for being here.

32:40.541 --> 32:45.421
Truth is, throwing this together
overnight wasn't easy.

32:46.255 --> 32:48.925
I almost died trying.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.010
Right, Mariana?

32:52.220 --> 32:54.806
And without the help

32:54.889 --> 32:59.060
of all the lovely women
who helped me organize it,

32:59.644 --> 33:01.270
this wouldn't be possible.

33:01.354 --> 33:04.023
You see, my husband didn't help me at all.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.109
Quite the opposite.

33:07.485 --> 33:08.861
He ruined everything.

33:10.363 --> 33:13.282
On top of that, he's been cheating on me.

33:16.035 --> 33:17.203
Want to know with whom?

33:17.286 --> 33:18.663
You won't believe this.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.916
With a grandma.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.334
Stop, Ana.

33:24.919 --> 33:26.796
What a nice family, huh?

33:26.879 --> 33:29.757
-Cheers to that! Cheers!
-Stop it. Give it to me.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.135
-Cheers to that!
-Enough.

33:33.553 --> 33:37.098
Since this is getting dull
and the band isn't playing,

33:37.181 --> 33:39.392
I'll sing a song for you.

33:41.477 --> 33:43.312
Just kidding.

33:43.396 --> 33:46.607
-Hey, don't! No, No!
-That's enough.

33:46.691 --> 33:50.278
-I'm not finished yet.
-It's over, Ana.

33:50.361 --> 33:51.529
Enough.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.072
-Let's go.
-No.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.199
Mom!

33:55.908 --> 33:57.118
Where are you going?

33:57.618 --> 33:59.537
Hey, what the hell happened?

33:59.620 --> 34:02.206
-Did you tell her?
-Who cares how she found out?

34:02.290 --> 34:05.960
What matters is, no more secrets.
Isn't that what you wanted, Mariana?

34:07.170 --> 34:10.840
I hope your relationship with Ana
isn't damaged and I hope…

34:12.050 --> 34:13.676
you can forgive me, sweetheart.

34:26.272 --> 34:27.231
What was that?

34:27.315 --> 34:29.609
-What?
-What you just said.

34:29.692 --> 34:31.444
What I didn't say, you mean.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.155
Are you talking about your lover?

34:35.782 --> 34:37.116
Or should I call her Tere?

34:39.368 --> 34:40.203
Who told you?

34:40.286 --> 34:42.288
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

34:43.873 --> 34:45.583
I was so blind. Right?

34:46.125 --> 34:50.713
I welcomed her into my house,
told her she was like family.

34:51.506 --> 34:54.050
-I was such a fool, huh?
-It's not like that.

34:55.009 --> 34:56.469
Why, Juan Carlos?

34:56.969 --> 34:59.972
Of all the women out there,
why did it have to be her?

35:00.556 --> 35:02.266
-To humiliate me, huh?
-No.

35:02.350 --> 35:05.978
How long have you been
making a fool out of me?

35:06.062 --> 35:08.022
-In my face, in my house!
-No, Ana.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.607
-Let me explain.
-Don't touch me!

35:10.900 --> 35:15.488
You're a piece of shit!
That's what you are, a piece of shit!

35:16.572 --> 35:18.157
I never want to see you again.

35:38.261 --> 35:39.929
Ana, can we talk?

35:40.972 --> 35:43.933
I never thought I wouldn't mind
making a fool out of myself.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.150
As a matter of fact,

35:52.692 --> 35:54.235
I never thought I'd do this.

35:54.735 --> 35:57.697
I always wanted to,
but never dared because of my allergies.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.909
I need to tell you something.

36:02.910 --> 36:06.956
Now that I think about it,
this year has been full of "nevers."

36:08.416 --> 36:11.085
I never thought
I'd be a mom to two babies.

36:11.752 --> 36:13.462
Or that I'd quit my job.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.384
Or that I might have cancer.

36:20.928 --> 36:23.055
Or that Juan Carlos and I would split up.

36:29.979 --> 36:33.316
I've had plenty
of "nevers" in my life lately too.

36:35.902 --> 36:38.362
I never thought I'd be a mom at 23.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.492
Or that I'd live with a stranger.

36:45.411 --> 36:47.413
Or that I'd grow so close

36:48.164 --> 36:50.124
to someone like you.

36:50.875 --> 36:51.959
No offense.

36:53.294 --> 36:54.337
No.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.257
Trust me, nothing offends me anymore.

37:03.179 --> 37:05.056
But there's something I need to know.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.522
Did you know about
Juan Carlos and your mom?

37:17.360 --> 37:19.904
You knew, didn't you?
That's why you didn't invite her.

37:29.372 --> 37:32.667
I would've sworn you'd never
hide something like that from me.

37:34.627 --> 37:35.962
I thought we were friends.

37:36.545 --> 37:38.005
Ana, of course we are friends.

37:40.466 --> 37:41.634
I love you so much.

37:41.717 --> 37:42.927
Stay away from me.

37:45.304 --> 37:46.555
Forgive me.

37:47.807 --> 37:50.893
You were so vulnerable.
I didn't want to hurt you.

37:50.977 --> 37:52.311
That's just an excuse.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.480
You're a traitor.

37:56.023 --> 37:59.735
I can't believe
after everything we've been through…

38:01.529 --> 38:02.697
What are you doing?

38:04.365 --> 38:06.117
I'm in love with you.

38:06.867 --> 38:08.369
Get out of my house.
