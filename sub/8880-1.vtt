00:14.333 --> 00:16.428
New York city..

00:16.759 --> 00:18.960
Not a land far far away..

00:19.080 --> 00:21.758
But still one of the most magical cities in the world.

00:21.878 --> 00:23.595
Its streets buzzing with people and..

00:23.715 --> 00:26.176
Buildings that seem to go on forever.

00:26.697 --> 00:29.433
It's a kind of place where fairytales
seem to be possible..

00:29.553 --> 00:30.957
No matter who you are.

00:32.329 --> 00:35.141
This isn't one of your typical
Cinderella story..

00:35.261 --> 00:37.204
There are no pumpkin,
no mice..

00:37.324 --> 00:38.482
No Cinderella.

00:38.514 --> 00:40.616
Or at least not the one
you're used to.

00:41.407 --> 00:42.540
Meet Charlie.

00:42.855 --> 00:44.800
He was young when he lost his mom.

00:44.842 --> 00:47.458
Leaving him with Art,
his step father.

00:47.482 --> 00:48.772
And then there's these two.

00:48.803 --> 00:50.063
Charlie's stepbrothers.

00:50.111 --> 00:52.341
Who are just a litte..
How do i say this..

00:52.378 --> 00:53.614
Annoying.

00:54.549 --> 00:57.627
Now Charlie stucks cleaning the place
his mom once owned.

00:58.424 --> 00:59.606
Wait, wait.

01:00.387 --> 01:02.951
Before we lay our fairytale play out,
you should know..

01:02.994 --> 01:04.660
Charlie has a talent.

01:04.780 --> 01:06.877
A real gift from music.

01:06.919 --> 01:08.573
Yo, come out!

01:48.263 --> 01:49.856
And this is where i come in.

01:50.038 --> 01:50.922
Like i said..

01:50.977 --> 01:53.158
This is a fairytale
with a twist.

01:53.194 --> 01:54.824
I'm no fairy godmother.

01:54.860 --> 01:56.290
But Charlie has a dream.

01:56.338 --> 01:58.326
And all he needs is someone
to hear him.

01:58.356 --> 01:59.695
And open a door.

02:03.025 --> 02:04.819
It's just water.
Come on, people!

02:09.826 --> 02:11.074
Keep it up, man.

02:11.268 --> 02:13.528
Next time i see you,
you better be in an album cover.

02:16.594 --> 02:17.672
Thank you.

02:19.924 --> 02:20.923
Who knows?

02:21.776 --> 02:23.933
Maybe one day, you'll be as famous as she is.

02:31.130 --> 02:32.890
And that's the beauty of this city.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.925
You never know
what's gonna happen next.

02:35.307 --> 02:37.927
Just around the corner, there could be
something amazing.

02:38.193 --> 02:39.532
Or someone.

03:36.475 --> 03:37.281
What?

03:37.299 --> 03:38.486
What's up?

03:40.248 --> 03:41.562
Cut, cut!

03:42.483 --> 03:43.786
What's wrong with playback?

03:44.289 --> 03:45.246
Working on it, boss.

03:45.289 --> 03:47.633
I don't know, this computer had
a panic attack or something.

03:47.668 --> 03:48.401
Unreal.

03:48.425 --> 03:50.812
Just give me a minute.
-Everyone take 10.

03:55.678 --> 03:56.678
Trumpet!

03:58.655 --> 04:01.624
Get that dog off of my couture!

04:01.872 --> 04:04.296
Why can't you have a
purse-sized dog..

04:04.320 --> 04:06.401
Like all of the other stars?

04:06.462 --> 04:09.021
This horse dog doesn't fit your image.

04:09.045 --> 04:11.021
Trumpet doesn't care about my image.

04:11.141 --> 04:13.242
He loves the real me,
and i love him.

04:13.297 --> 04:15.248
Isn't that right, boy?
Isn't that right..

04:15.314 --> 04:16.632
Should i rub your belly?

04:16.680 --> 04:18.026
Should i rub our miss' belly?

04:18.087 --> 04:20.933
No one touches my belly.

04:36.003 --> 04:36.857
Hey!

04:36.977 --> 04:39.243
Grilled cheese with pickles,
on rye.

04:39.285 --> 04:40.878
You are the best, Martha.

04:40.926 --> 04:43.755
If it weren't for Diego,
i would propose to you right now.

04:43.804 --> 04:46.325
That'd be great, maybe she'll stop bugging me for a bigger ring.

04:46.368 --> 04:47.652
Hah! This guy..

04:47.701 --> 04:50.720
He brings me stuff he finds in the streets,
everyday.

04:50.866 --> 04:52.641
Why don't you find me a ring in the street?

04:52.671 --> 04:54.589
And maybe some customers.
-Customers..

04:54.626 --> 04:55.928
That's what we need.

04:56.048 --> 04:59.195
If your mom only knew Arthur turns
this place into a ghost town.

04:59.686 --> 05:01.243
I should do something about it.

05:01.279 --> 05:02.915
Diego's not gonna have to do anything.

05:02.975 --> 05:05.746
Cause things are not gonna be like this
for much longer.

05:05.788 --> 05:07.987
Really? Alright, Charlie..

05:08.030 --> 05:09.527
You got a little plan brewing?

05:13.767 --> 05:14.930
Nope, i got nothing.

05:17.230 --> 05:19.577
I can barely move in this outift.

05:19.898 --> 05:21.570
You look amazing.

05:22.193 --> 05:23.193
Thanks, girl.

05:23.368 --> 05:26.277
It's the latest design by GG le Tron.

05:26.397 --> 05:28.022
What about GG le Normal?

05:28.142 --> 05:29.810
GG le Clothing Wearable by Human?

05:29.852 --> 05:32.063
Can't we put any outfits from
anyone like that?

05:32.333 --> 05:33.454
There's my girl.

05:33.503 --> 05:35.551
Daddy!
-Kadee, MTV!

05:35.593 --> 05:38.023
I didn't think you'd make it.
-No hugging, it'll wrinkle!

05:38.089 --> 05:40.022
I think she'd survive a wrinkle or two.
Come here.

05:40.142 --> 05:43.468
That's what i'm going to say. Go for it.
You only live once.

05:43.588 --> 05:46.681
The biggest star of Majesty Records,
and i remember when she was singing in diapers.

05:47.044 --> 05:48.007
How's the shoot?

05:48.062 --> 05:48.831
You're killing it?

05:48.855 --> 05:50.874
The only thing getting killed
are my feet.

05:50.994 --> 05:52.419
It's going fine.

05:52.539 --> 05:54.137
Can i talk to you, please?
-Yeah.

05:54.325 --> 05:57.470
Hey guys, why don't you get a shot of that set,
that i'm paying so much money for?

06:01.813 --> 06:03.068
What's up?
-Daddy..

06:03.188 --> 06:05.047
Don't you think these all
is a little..

06:05.253 --> 06:06.217
Much?

06:06.337 --> 06:08.196
Like maybe i should be singing my own stuff.

06:08.251 --> 06:09.347
I don't know if that's the best idea..

06:09.396 --> 06:11.195
Best idea, jinx!

06:11.950 --> 06:12.792
Sweety..

06:13.180 --> 06:14.742
I just want you to be protected.

06:14.862 --> 06:17.432
That's why i get you the best songwriter
money can buy.

06:17.680 --> 06:18.715
Don't worry.

06:18.835 --> 06:20.163
Your new single is gonna be a hit.

06:20.212 --> 06:21.294
Trust me.

06:24.696 --> 06:26.248
I got to take this, ok?

06:26.368 --> 06:28.522
We're announcing the talent search today.

06:34.432 --> 06:37.176
Kadee, your dog is chewing
on the microphone.

06:39.215 --> 06:41.869
Trumpet, that microphone is not
a dog bone!

07:15.623 --> 07:17.283
These are different from the ones i like.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.193
Look, it's MTV.

07:19.738 --> 07:22.307
Kadee, after 6 number 1s..

07:23.159 --> 07:24.044
Kadee!

07:24.092 --> 07:25.910
Hate these clothes so much..

07:26.030 --> 07:27.613
Why can't they all see?

07:27.733 --> 07:30.236
The more i go through,
i don't want to..

07:30.636 --> 07:32.580
Just want to be me.

07:50.719 --> 07:52.279
Who do you think you are?

07:52.951 --> 07:54.874
I don't pay you to waste your time.

07:54.994 --> 07:56.964
Actually, you don't pay me at all.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.677
Are you sassing me, Charlie?

07:58.744 --> 07:59.677
No sir.

07:59.797 --> 08:00.598
Good.

08:01.741 --> 08:05.140
My mom used to let me sing whatever i..
-Your mom..

08:05.331 --> 08:07.178
Not only left me in charge of you, but..

08:07.209 --> 08:09.939
Also of this dump which i also have to run.

08:10.278 --> 08:11.599
It's time to open.

08:11.824 --> 08:12.667
Let's go.

08:13.121 --> 08:14.575
Are you guys open yet?

08:15.023 --> 08:17.150
Not quite, but..

08:17.205 --> 08:19.543
We have a special treat for you,
Charlie!

08:19.580 --> 08:21.786
Why don't you introduce the opening act?

08:21.822 --> 08:23.209
Ladies and gentlemen..

08:23.262 --> 08:25.365
Please give it up
for Andrew and Lloyd.

08:25.952 --> 08:27.315
That's Androyd!

08:28.333 --> 08:31.090
When you combine Andrew and Lloyd..

08:31.114 --> 08:32.374
Androyd.

08:32.410 --> 08:34.366
I hate you so much, Lloyd.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.626
Ouch, harsh much?

08:46.011 --> 08:46.878
Yeah!

08:59.742 --> 09:00.548

09:30.778 --> 09:31.826

09:38.296 --> 09:39.435

-Hello!

09:39.489 --> 09:40.610

09:40.646 --> 09:43.487

09:47.908 --> 09:50.095
Thank you.
-Oh, you want a hug?

09:50.215 --> 09:51.916
Thank you, you're beautiful.

09:52.013 --> 09:53.097
How are you?

09:53.133 --> 09:54.475
Can we just get through this?

09:54.511 --> 09:56.256
Remember, we agree to keep
this one short.

09:56.299 --> 09:57.813
But they love us,
look at it!

09:58.313 --> 09:59.282
No?

10:00.148 --> 10:01.874
Alright, fine.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.461
Let's go.

10:04.803 --> 10:08.127
You look fantastic, you both look amazing.
-Thanks.

10:08.247 --> 10:11.452
Let's do a couple of photoes.
-Finn, Kadee, over here!

10:11.572 --> 10:13.558
How about a kiss?
-Alright.

10:13.678 --> 10:15.712
You better show this one, boys!

10:17.994 --> 10:19.556
Oh yeah, that's good.

10:19.676 --> 10:22.955
Could you move over a bit?
I just want the light to hit my cheekbones.

10:23.075 --> 10:24.739
Cheers, thanks love.

10:33.710 --> 10:35.685
It's actually clean.

10:36.102 --> 10:38.185
So am i free to go?
-Yes.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.938
Free to go drop off Androyd's
demo CD..

10:41.058 --> 10:44.167
Into Majesty Records for the talent search.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.324
Androyd has a CD?

10:46.444 --> 10:47.914
Are you jealous, Charlie?

10:48.113 --> 10:49.543
You should be.

10:49.663 --> 10:51.818
But don't worry,
when they're number 1..

10:51.871 --> 10:53.856
You can clean the dressing room.

10:54.368 --> 10:57.996
That's a relief, for a second there i thought
you were gonna say something really mean.

10:58.685 --> 11:00.781
Don't forget, curfew is midnight!

11:01.114 --> 11:02.326
Can't wait!

11:07.603 --> 11:10.117
Kadee, look over here.
-Thank you.

11:11.646 --> 11:12.949
You are great.

11:13.789 --> 11:15.536
I think i'm gonna walk today, Tony.

11:15.581 --> 11:17.944
Get some fresh air.
-You're father won't like this.

11:18.064 --> 11:20.990
He also wouldn't like you're using his Nicks tickets without him knowing.

11:21.110 --> 11:22.690
Enjoy the park.
-See you.

11:22.810 --> 11:24.526
Come on, Trumpet.
-You take care of her.

12:48.128 --> 12:50.907
You saw me play in the streets the other day.
-Yeah.

12:51.027 --> 12:54.269
Do you work here?
-Yup, studio engineer.

12:54.389 --> 12:57.464
And you want to work here as..

12:57.584 --> 12:59.032
A janitor?

12:59.152 --> 13:01.658
Ever since i was a little boy,
i've just wanted to scrub toilets.

13:01.713 --> 13:03.455
I can see how that beats
playing music.

13:03.493 --> 13:06.390
Do you ever play?
-Yeah, i played the streets..

13:06.510 --> 13:08.586
Barmitzvah,
Botmitzvah..

13:08.706 --> 13:10.826
Any mitzvah you can book, really.

13:10.856 --> 13:12.582
That's all behind me now.

13:13.037 --> 13:14.065
Shawn.

13:14.185 --> 13:15.148
Charlie.

13:16.064 --> 13:17.185
Don't work too hard.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.504
I always work too hard.

13:21.806 --> 13:23.343
Do me a favor, would you?

13:23.843 --> 13:25.098
Make sure he gets hired.

13:25.129 --> 13:27.741
Will you go on a date with me?
-No.

13:28.605 --> 13:30.183
I'll still do it.

13:35.842 --> 13:38.422
Stupid boy, right Trumpet?

13:39.505 --> 13:41.164
Not a total loss.

14:24.637 --> 14:25.801
It's her.

14:25.839 --> 14:27.445
It's her!
It is!

14:27.483 --> 14:30.606
Kadee Worth!
Mom, it's Kadee Worth!

14:30.644 --> 14:32.234
It's Kadee Worth!

14:32.279 --> 14:33.491
Thanks a lot, trumpet.

14:33.819 --> 14:35.417
I love you!

14:35.467 --> 14:37.436
Can i get a picture with you?
-Sure.

14:37.593 --> 14:39.145
Mom, take my picture.

14:42.194 --> 14:43.364
Thank you!

14:44.914 --> 14:45.865
What are you doing?

15:17.067 --> 15:19.236
No touching the merchandise.

15:20.997 --> 15:22.582
Are you here to make another payment?

15:22.609 --> 15:23.491
Yeah.

15:30.872 --> 15:35.100
$9,57?

15:35.747 --> 15:38.826
At this rate, your mom's piano will be yours..

15:39.640 --> 15:41.914
In 2021..

17:17.127 --> 17:19.025
Bye , Bern!
-See you later, Charlie!

17:55.975 --> 17:57.470
So many thank yous..

17:57.497 --> 17:59.815
My agents,
my managers..

17:59.867 --> 18:04.244
And of course none of this would be possible
without my trusty rag..

18:17.119 --> 18:18.265
Dad, you..

18:18.308 --> 18:19.376
Hey!

18:19.550 --> 18:20.758
What are you doing here?

18:20.803 --> 18:22.579
I didn't mean to startle you,
i work here.

18:22.614 --> 18:24.258
That could be fake.

18:24.284 --> 18:26.174
People get fake IDs.

18:27.647 --> 18:31.040
If i were gonna get a fake ID,
would i use this picture?

18:33.979 --> 18:37.084
Yeah, he's checked out.

18:38.081 --> 18:40.821
What do you have behind your back, Charlie?

18:40.941 --> 18:42.387
Nothing.

18:42.964 --> 18:44.705
You're not a good liar.

18:44.783 --> 18:46.500
I am too a good liar.

18:46.517 --> 18:50.156
I am a very good liar, i've lied successfuly
on many occasions.

18:50.191 --> 18:51.866
In fact just yesterday.

18:55.618 --> 18:57.273
I'm not a very good liar.

18:57.300 --> 18:58.262
I lied.

18:58.288 --> 19:00.457
See? You are a liar.

19:02.490 --> 19:07.118
Kadee, my darling, my love.
It's me your prince, you're late for the..

19:10.161 --> 19:11.465
Who's this guy?

19:11.517 --> 19:12.812
Charlie.

19:12.908 --> 19:14.080
Okay.

19:14.141 --> 19:16.915
Are you signed to the Majesty Records as well?

19:17.213 --> 19:18.848
I'm the janitor.

19:18.968 --> 19:21.481
That's a bit of a lame stage name, mate.

19:21.578 --> 19:25.411
I'll go with something else.
I don't know, the Janitor?

19:25.525 --> 19:27.240
It might work.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.935
What, are you like a rapper or something?

19:29.979 --> 19:33.565
No, i'm just the actual janitor.

19:34.378 --> 19:36.750
Oh, well..

19:37.048 --> 19:38.753
That's great.

19:39.672 --> 19:43.036
Okay.. Bye.

19:44.663 --> 19:49.266
It's time for Kadee Worth's fragrance
launch party.

19:49.310 --> 19:51.978
I told them to wait,
let's go.

20:02.848 --> 20:04.510
Kadee..

20:05.122 --> 20:06.347
Great..

20:06.417 --> 20:08.965
A wonderful evening with my boyfriend.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.382
He's Finn.

20:10.399 --> 20:12.560
Most girls would kill
to be set up with him.

20:12.638 --> 20:14.856
I know, i know.
-You should be "happy".

20:14.882 --> 20:16.124
"And i am".

20:16.177 --> 20:18.600
Why are you guys keep doing
that thing with your fingers?

20:18.617 --> 20:21.653
I've told you, it confuses me.

20:21.697 --> 20:24.933
And it frightens me.
It makes me want to punch you both.

20:24.977 --> 20:27.113
How's this for my "i'm so happy..

20:27.140 --> 20:31.408
"I'm in a relationship that my dad thinks would sell records" face.

20:31.895 --> 20:33.609
It's good.
-Great.

20:33.729 --> 20:35.341
Come on, trumpet.

20:36.426 --> 20:39.425
If you're gonna be late, call.
You know how it works.

20:39.452 --> 20:43.292
He's probably the youngest janitor ever,
am i right?

20:55.274 --> 20:58.301
Uh.. Would you..

21:00.719 --> 21:02.626
That's funny.

21:02.652 --> 21:06.022
I could do that too.
We're playing..

21:10.313 --> 21:12.561
Inappropriate.

21:13.050 --> 21:16.981
How adorable are we, right?

21:17.751 --> 21:20.034
Just adorable.

21:52.274 --> 21:54.688
Scrub that, uh..

22:06.261 --> 22:08.798
I hope you have a good night, sir.

22:11.885 --> 22:15.725
How about that weather we're having?
Very nice..

22:51.202 --> 22:52.995
What do you think, Trumpet?

22:57.398 --> 22:58.955
Someday.

23:07.649 --> 23:09.407
Hey Kadee.
-Hey!

23:09.459 --> 23:11.482
How's your dog?
-He's good, he misses you.

23:11.517 --> 23:14.736
I miss him too.
I think i'm falling for you dog.

23:17.389 --> 23:18.666
Somebody will..

23:18.710 --> 23:21.386
Somebody will clean that up.
-Somebody like the janitor?

23:21.809 --> 23:23.724
That's me.

23:24.310 --> 23:26.996
I should probably get started on that.

23:47.065 --> 23:49.296
Sweet.

24:09.377 --> 24:11.354
Testing, 1..2..3.

24:11.389 --> 24:13.324
Ready to record his new single..

24:13.368 --> 24:16.858
Grammy winner Charlie Prince,
5 gold albums, 8 top ten hits.

24:16.893 --> 24:19.717
With his new hit
"Hands up".

24:19.837 --> 24:21.099
What..

24:41.745 --> 24:43.074
Thank you.

24:43.144 --> 24:44.736
Thank you..

24:46.725 --> 24:49.953
Shawn, i'm so sorry.
I was just messing around.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.848
Messing around?

24:51.968 --> 24:55.015
How'd you like to try that for real?
-For real?

24:55.478 --> 24:58.842
You gotta be kidding,
i'm just the kid with rags and mops.

24:58.921 --> 25:01.947
Dude, you are way more than just a kid with rags.

25:01.991 --> 25:04.781
What i heard in there was a bonafide
recording artist.

25:04.834 --> 25:08.162
And a real recording artist needs a demo,
i can help you make that happen.

25:08.197 --> 25:10.576
You mean here, at the studio?

25:10.619 --> 25:13.416
Don't say anything, just sing.

25:18.944 --> 25:20.999
Alright, you're ready to go?

25:21.524 --> 25:22.976
Here it comes.

27:53.549 --> 27:56.581
Hey, can we do another?
I got tons of more songs.

28:08.847 --> 28:11.882
Boys, this is your ticket..

28:11.943 --> 28:13.841
To the big time.

28:14.499 --> 28:16.484
What does it say?

28:17.508 --> 28:20.694
Thank you for sending your demo material
to Majesty Records..

28:20.712 --> 28:27.610
For consideration, presently your demo package is one of a quantity of exemplary material that was submitted to our office.

28:27.638 --> 28:32.103
We regret to inform you,
you did not qualify..

28:32.223 --> 28:36.285
At the Majesty Records talent contest..

28:45.996 --> 28:47.829
This is your fault.

28:50.256 --> 28:53.057
You're my brother.

28:54.009 --> 28:55.964
I love you.
-I love you too.

29:23.191 --> 29:25.675
And why are we following this kid?

29:26.598 --> 29:27.794
I don't know.

29:28.088 --> 29:29.487
There's just something about him.

29:29.522 --> 29:30.586
OMG..

29:30.628 --> 29:33.161
He's so dreamy..

29:33.281 --> 29:35.591
Just keep the engine running.

29:36.347 --> 29:37.795
Charlie..

29:40.318 --> 29:42.075
What did you do, kid?

29:42.117 --> 29:43.495
Sell a body part?

29:43.544 --> 29:45.070
I got a job.

29:47.716 --> 29:51.965
If you keep doing payments like this,
and that piano's yours 5 years top.

29:53.647 --> 29:57.082
So, what can i play for you today, my man?

29:57.292 --> 29:59.328
Play "Perfect Harmony" again.

29:59.356 --> 30:01.197
For $100..

30:02.142 --> 30:05.463
It's Perfect Harmony,
going out to my man Bernie.

30:13.771 --> 30:15.848
Not bad for a janitor.

30:16.674 --> 30:19.914
Thanks, i.. i was just messing around.

30:19.941 --> 30:22.551
Why are you here anyway?
Did you follow me here?

30:22.572 --> 30:25.364
I didn't follow, i was just..

30:26.095 --> 30:28.635
Looking for some creepy stuff
for my room.

30:29.621 --> 30:30.731
Uh uh..

30:30.801 --> 30:31.969
What are you doing here?

30:31.990 --> 30:35.720
You come to some pawn shop to play
a ratty old piano, what's that about?

30:35.840 --> 30:37.032
It's my mom's.

30:37.220 --> 30:39.537
And more gorgeous, it cannot be.

30:40.369 --> 30:41.630
Thanks.

30:45.493 --> 30:47.724
I should say it was my mom's.

30:47.962 --> 30:49.488
Once upon a time.

30:49.788 --> 30:52.562
So, your mom's gone?

30:53.829 --> 30:58.463
My stepdad used the piano money
to buy karaoke machine.

30:58.540 --> 30:59.961
Sorry, Charlie.

31:03.829 --> 31:08.050
Why don't you let a professional handle this?

31:15.774 --> 31:17.264
My mom died too.

31:17.484 --> 31:19.401
I'm sorry, i didn't know.

31:19.800 --> 31:23.320
How could you? I don't wear the
"My mom died" T-Shirt much these days.

31:23.348 --> 31:24.922
You have one too?

31:26.098 --> 31:29.211
It's good to talk to somebody who understand.

32:22.262 --> 32:23.766
That was fun.

32:25.019 --> 32:26.803
What were you playing before?

32:27.292 --> 32:29.398
That was just a little bit of a song i wrote.

32:29.518 --> 32:32.169
So those were your songs i got wet
the other day?

32:32.232 --> 32:35.870
Don't worry, they stayed all in one piece.

32:39.324 --> 32:40.507
Can I?

32:46.219 --> 32:48.178
These lyrics are great.

32:48.619 --> 32:50.700
Why haven't i heard you sing
songs like thesE?

32:50.714 --> 32:53.093
Right, my dad would go nuts.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.937
They don't exactly fit the
Kadee Worth Brand.

32:56.125 --> 32:58.568
But maybe someday i will.

32:58.827 --> 33:01.045
No, you need to do it today.

33:01.955 --> 33:04.242
I want to take you some place.
Do you trust me?

33:04.277 --> 33:06.047
Ever since i was a little girl..

33:06.068 --> 33:08.069
My dad always told me..

33:08.244 --> 33:11.394
Kadee, trust the janitor.

33:14.466 --> 33:15.802
I trust you.

33:19.441 --> 33:20.942
Miss Worth..

33:21.292 --> 33:23.203
For my kid.

33:24.140 --> 33:26.425
Make it out to Bernie.

33:27.013 --> 33:28.518
For my kid.

33:29.197 --> 33:30.729
Named Bernie.

33:37.187 --> 33:40.259
Princess, subway is one block away.

33:40.379 --> 33:43.089
Kadee, your dad's not gonna like it.

33:43.138 --> 33:46.700
He's also not gonna like you're using his Yankee tickets without him knowing.

33:46.770 --> 33:48.645
You two enjoy yourselves.

33:50.059 --> 33:52.976
You're gonna need this.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.730
So..
-This is the spot.

34:03.772 --> 34:04.815
Here?

34:04.829 --> 34:06.068
It's perfect.

34:06.739 --> 34:09.379
And no one will know it's you.

34:10.918 --> 34:13.373
That makes me feel a lot better.

34:21.100 --> 34:24.304
Ladies and gentlemen, i would like to..

34:24.360 --> 34:26.172
Charlie, no.
-What?

34:27.360 --> 34:28.824
I can't do it.

34:29.944 --> 34:32.754
70,000 screaming fans,
you're good to go.

34:32.810 --> 34:35.197
8 tourists, and you have a problem?

34:47.577 --> 34:48.846
Okay.

37:06.645 --> 37:08.738
Break it up.

37:12.910 --> 37:15.058
Move on, or i'll give you a ticket.

37:15.261 --> 37:17.047
Ow..

37:24.155 --> 37:25.626
Here you go.

37:26.599 --> 37:28.838
You gotta keep this.

37:29.195 --> 37:31.787
First dollar you make from your own music.

37:31.815 --> 37:34.768
No no, you put that back in there.

37:35.756 --> 37:37.373
Thanks, Charlie.

37:39.052 --> 37:40.292
You're good.

37:40.390 --> 37:43.203
You should do this for a living..

37:44.373 --> 37:45.737
Thanks.

37:45.857 --> 37:47.312
Good.

37:47.340 --> 37:51.559
No no.. Wait wait!
Come back, hold the bus!

37:51.580 --> 37:54.253
Come on, i got it!
-Wait!

37:54.598 --> 37:56.123
Come on!

37:56.573 --> 37:58.441
Hey, one second.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.004
Thank you.

38:08.458 --> 38:11.866
I can't believe i just did that.
-You were awesome.

38:11.986 --> 38:14.555
I haven't felt like that performing
in so long.

38:14.604 --> 38:16.738
Thank you, Charlie.
-My pleasure.

38:16.787 --> 38:18.033
Let me pay you back somehow.

38:18.061 --> 38:19.579
No no..
-Here.

38:19.621 --> 38:22.014
I want you to come to this party
my dad's throwing.

38:23.043 --> 38:24.356
Really?
-It's gonna be amazing.

38:24.377 --> 38:27.331
Except i'll be working and have to miss out
on all the fun.

38:33.282 --> 38:34.655
Wait!

38:34.858 --> 38:36.909
Are you Kadee Worth?

38:37.112 --> 38:39.122
Can i have your autograph?
-Sure.

38:39.164 --> 38:41.081
It's Kadee Worth.

38:45.710 --> 38:48.558
This is Kadee Worth!

39:03.978 --> 39:05.525
You're late.

39:07.868 --> 39:11.431
Nope, 58 seconds to spare, so..

39:11.487 --> 39:13.306
If you'll excuse me.

39:20.500 --> 39:22.032
What's this?

39:22.660 --> 39:24.346
Invitation to..

39:24.409 --> 39:27.028
Majesty Records' masquarade ball?

39:27.056 --> 39:29.673
That's when they announce the winner
to the talent search.

39:30.220 --> 39:31.969
Charlie, did you steal this?

39:31.990 --> 39:33.215
No, i didn't steal it.

39:33.236 --> 39:34.656
Kadee Worth gave them to me.

39:35.233 --> 39:37.136
Right.. Kadee Worth gave it to you.

39:37.178 --> 39:40.446
Kadee Worth, that's so cool.

39:41.261 --> 39:42.632
It is.

39:42.863 --> 39:44.661
Just give it back.

39:44.948 --> 39:47.630
Charlie, i'm sorry..

39:47.833 --> 39:49.876
I can't let this go to waste.

39:49.918 --> 39:51.406
Excuse me?

39:51.526 --> 39:56.447
Boys, your stepbrother has given you
the opportunity of a life time.

39:56.489 --> 39:59.416
You're gonna go to that party and
you're gonna show Reginald Worth..

39:59.458 --> 40:02.314
That he made a big mistake
rejecting your CD.

40:02.356 --> 40:04.511
That is my invitation!

40:05.582 --> 40:06.876
Charlie..

40:07.589 --> 40:10.276
This is your opportunity too,
you..

40:10.507 --> 40:12.874
You can stay behind and you can..

40:12.944 --> 40:16.668
You can run the karaoke machine.
Consider it a promotion.

40:17.557 --> 40:19.278
Boys, get to bed.

40:19.320 --> 40:23.128
We gotta get up early and rent ourselves
some costumes.

40:27.086 --> 40:29.446
Masquerade.. We're going..

40:29.509 --> 40:32.021
Popularity is growing.

40:32.049 --> 40:36.478
Our lyrics are flowing..
-the ladies..
-There's gonna be ladies?

40:37.080 --> 40:38.679
There's gonna be ladies..

40:38.770 --> 40:41.171
I can't do this anymore.

40:41.458 --> 40:43.496
Are there gonna be ladies?

40:44.462 --> 40:46.477
Diego, get my sewing machine.

40:46.691 --> 40:49.049
You mean that sewing machine i found on the street
that you didn't want?

40:49.105 --> 40:53.127
Yes, finally one of your pieces of junk
is gonna be of some use.

40:53.295 --> 40:58.295
I'll get it in a second, can you believe someone
threw away this perfectly good bike?

40:58.345 --> 41:01.879
Stop messing with the garbage, we gotta get
Charlie into that party.

41:01.999 --> 41:03.566
What party?

41:32.555 --> 41:34.675
Hey, done with your chores?

41:34.724 --> 41:37.544
You're smiling.
Nobody smile about chores.

41:37.664 --> 41:39.876
Ta da!
For you.

41:39.918 --> 41:41.262
To work the karaoke machine?

41:41.269 --> 41:43.081
For the Majesty Records' party.

41:43.416 --> 41:45.102
Arthur gave my invitation to Androyd.

41:45.137 --> 41:47.313
Come on, you're gonna let a detail
like an invitation to stop you?

41:47.355 --> 41:49.911
No, i'm gonna let about a billion other things stop me.

41:49.932 --> 41:53.349
Arthur will destroy me if he found out i went,
i have school tomorrow, there's tons of security..

41:53.390 --> 41:56.023
Maybe even an X-Ray.

41:56.499 --> 41:57.688
For you.

41:57.925 --> 42:00.566
Your welcome.
-Thank you.

42:00.934 --> 42:02.692
It's awesome, but..

42:02.771 --> 42:05.378
Who's gonna MC karaoke
if i'm not here?

42:05.921 --> 42:06.699
I'm your man.

42:06.725 --> 42:08.326
Seriously?
-Yeah.

42:08.396 --> 42:11.764
I've always wanted to do this job
and i know i can do a great job too.

42:11.825 --> 42:13.207
What if i see Arthur at the party?

42:13.242 --> 42:14.773
We thought of that.

42:15.219 --> 42:16.857
You may see Arthur..

42:16.901 --> 42:20.111
But Arthur will never see you.

42:23.477 --> 42:25.094
Game changer.

42:27.603 --> 42:29.016
Hey!

42:39.075 --> 42:41.525
Boys! let's go!

42:42.777 --> 42:44.546
Have a nice pity party.

42:44.588 --> 42:47.023
You're having a party?

42:47.058 --> 42:49.206
I was making fun of him, you idiot.

42:50.724 --> 42:53.376
I gotta..
I'll bring you some cake.

43:01.197 --> 43:03.080
I still don't know how i'm
gonna make it home before Arthur.

43:03.108 --> 43:04.439
That'll be easy.

43:04.460 --> 43:07.448
You're gonna take the fastest transportation
there is in this city.

43:07.483 --> 43:09.386
Tada!

43:10.682 --> 43:13.236
My trusted steed, is now yours.

43:13.264 --> 43:14.600
Perfect!

43:15.663 --> 43:17.629
Do you have the mask?
-Yeah.

43:23.578 --> 43:25.656
Do you think he'll get in?

43:25.733 --> 43:27.223
Not a chance.

43:31.088 --> 43:35.231
Kadee, you're performing your number 1 single tonight
"Love you, Hate you". Looking forward to it?

43:35.259 --> 43:38.650
Yes, i'm very excited, it's always great to perform
in front of a crowd.

43:38.671 --> 43:41.820
Whether it's Madison Square Garden
or here.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.672
Would you say, this is your most personal album to date?

43:44.721 --> 43:47.219
When you say personal..
-Of course it is.

43:47.310 --> 43:49.323
Of course it is, right?

43:49.379 --> 43:52.318
Except for the part in the song
when she said she hates me.

43:52.367 --> 43:55.714
Cause she doesn't, right?
Do you?

43:55.777 --> 43:58.497
It's like when i was recording my album..

43:58.518 --> 44:00.078
You never want to speak the truth..

44:18.704 --> 44:23.294
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Nick Cannon.

44:26.524 --> 44:28.567
Thank you.

44:29.349 --> 44:33.582
Welcome Majesty Records' guests.
Are you all ready to get down?

44:35.804 --> 44:37.638
Let's do this.

44:45.579 --> 44:48.238
Lloyd, shape up!

44:48.588 --> 44:51.424
You'll never get discovered
makin a mess of yourself.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.682
I'm more likely to get discovered..

44:53.717 --> 44:55.011
What?

44:55.424 --> 44:59.114
Think about it, you're walking to a party,
there's 2 guys standing.

44:59.156 --> 45:02.570
One of them has barbeque sauce,
covering his face.

45:02.605 --> 45:05.174
Me, i look at the sauce guy.

45:05.217 --> 45:09.557
Andrew, would you like to go mingle
while your brother cleans himself up?

45:09.585 --> 45:11.111
Absolutely.

45:15.003 --> 45:16.396
Hey.

45:16.648 --> 45:19.456
Hi, i'm Llyod.
-I'm tammy.

45:19.988 --> 45:22.285
No.. No..

45:22.334 --> 45:24.916
No!

45:31.762 --> 45:33.568
Invitation?

45:34.995 --> 45:36.458
That guy stole my ticket.

45:36.514 --> 45:39.908
And i was like 'Use it, no way that doorman's gonna believe that's your ticket'.

45:39.922 --> 45:42.926
And then he was like
"doormen are stupid."

45:43.367 --> 45:44.382
What?

45:44.417 --> 45:48.533
And i was like "doormen is a respectable profession
with a very rich history".

45:48.547 --> 45:50.032
Wait here.

45:51.026 --> 45:52.411
That worked.

46:00.816 --> 46:02.174
Sorry.

46:03.195 --> 46:05.476
Excuse me, i didn't see you.

46:06.098 --> 46:07.974
No, it's my bad.

46:08.527 --> 46:11.006
I didn't see you there, big guy.

46:11.321 --> 46:14.260
Keep up the good work.
Bye.

46:14.561 --> 46:17.411
Do i know you?
-No.

46:33.044 --> 46:35.780
ALright, make some noise!

46:38.821 --> 46:42.322
Come on, come on.
I got babies at home that make more noise than that.

46:42.357 --> 46:44.078
Make some noise!

46:46.346 --> 46:48.942
Yeah, that's what i'm talking about.

46:48.998 --> 46:54.265
We got Kadee Worth in the building,
Ya'll make some noise!

46:55.074 --> 46:58.468
What up, Nick!
-What's up, girl!

46:59.195 --> 47:04.529
You all are looking beautiful,
let's go ahead and show in the Majesty Records, we know how to have a good time.

47:07.581 --> 47:10.249
Are you ready to dance with your king?

47:10.634 --> 47:13.321
No, i'm ready to dance with you.

47:15.322 --> 47:16.588
Hey! Looking good.

47:16.609 --> 47:18.233
Thanks, you too.

47:18.247 --> 47:20.647
Thank you for doing this for me.
-Anytime.

47:21.103 --> 47:22.488
Impressed.

47:22.516 --> 47:24.042
Yeah.

48:12.069 --> 48:14.512
Let's mix it up, party people!

48:14.547 --> 48:16.450
Ya'll looking a little too comfortable.

48:16.457 --> 48:20.993
I want everybody on the dance floor,
turn to your left and meet your new partner.

48:27.010 --> 48:29.278
I guess you're my partner.
-I guess i am.

48:39.753 --> 48:41.758
So, having fun tonight?

48:41.807 --> 48:43.479
If i'm being honest..

48:43.599 --> 48:45.222
Not really.

48:51.250 --> 48:53.613
I guess now i am.

48:56.119 --> 48:58.976
I don't know, i just have a hard time..

48:59.697 --> 49:02.328
Relaxing and being yourself?

49:02.797 --> 49:04.380
How do you know that?

49:04.590 --> 49:06.361
I see.

49:11.559 --> 49:14.666
Thanks for the dance,
you're pretty amazing.

49:16.485 --> 49:20.330
No, it's true. You're too amazing
to be anything less than yourself.

49:21.191 --> 49:23.046
Just be you.

49:25.620 --> 49:27.692
Nice to meet you.

49:34.077 --> 49:41.476
Alright, alright, it is time to announce the finalist
for the Majesty Records' talent search.

49:44.336 --> 49:45.819
It should be Androyd.

49:45.845 --> 49:48.190
And the winner is..

49:48.828 --> 49:51.426
Fay Train!

49:52.262 --> 49:54.344
Fay Train..

49:54.930 --> 49:59.524
Ladies and gentlemen, i've just been informed
that the plane has been delayed.

49:59.551 --> 50:03.325
And Fay Train will not be with us tonight.

50:03.360 --> 50:04.690
What?

50:04.716 --> 50:06.527
Why am i just hear, Irma!

50:06.562 --> 50:08.725
I did not,
i was not aware.

50:08.769 --> 50:12.110
I.. We could..

50:12.302 --> 50:16.256
They're upset, somebody better give them
a runner up.

50:16.720 --> 50:20.193
Sometimes opportunity knocks.

50:20.385 --> 50:21.542
Sorry, off limits.

50:21.551 --> 50:23.702
It's me, Charlie!

50:24.446 --> 50:26.274
Hey man.
-Hey.

50:26.484 --> 50:27.928
Check it out.

50:28.048 --> 50:29.353
All done.

50:29.380 --> 50:30.464
Rags?

50:30.499 --> 50:32.319
Everyone needs a stage name.

50:32.380 --> 50:35.229
I figured when you're huge, you need to remember
where you came from.

50:35.264 --> 50:39.051
So all those millions of fans
don't go to your head.

50:40.832 --> 50:43.272
This is the nicest thing
anyone ever done for me.

50:43.299 --> 50:45.914
Don't get all emotional on me, now.

50:45.958 --> 50:48.023
It's good by the way,
really good.

50:48.084 --> 50:52.836
Hello, Majesty Records. I'm Andrew.
-I'm Lloyd, and we're Androyd.

50:53.605 --> 50:55.381
No..

51:03.028 --> 51:04.900
No..

51:05.576 --> 51:07.080
Who are they?

51:07.150 --> 51:09.330
Oh man, what are they doing?

51:09.374 --> 51:11.333
You know these guys?

51:11.368 --> 51:15.977
Unfortunately yes, those clows are sort of my stepbrothers.

51:25.421 --> 51:28.147
I can't take this anymore.

51:28.267 --> 51:30.308
This is your chance,
get up there.

51:30.544 --> 51:32.775
What? On stage?
I can't do that.

51:32.810 --> 51:34.495
If you're terrible,
nobody will know it's you.

51:34.522 --> 51:37.067
Come on, you're gonna kill it.
-Okay.

51:50.231 --> 51:51.455
What happened?

51:51.481 --> 51:54.215
What did you do?
-Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for..

51:54.285 --> 51:55.885
Rags!

52:49.673 --> 52:52.358
Hey!
Stop it!

53:12.803 --> 53:15.401
Charlie?

53:54.875 --> 53:56.449
Let's get out of here.

53:56.493 --> 53:58.837
No, i want to stay for the party.

53:58.855 --> 54:01.149
These girls are totally checking me out.

54:01.175 --> 54:03.607
They just want to interview you
for the Idiot Magazine.

54:03.651 --> 54:04.493
really?

54:04.537 --> 54:08.447
Plenty of people here she could talk,
if these people are audience!

54:08.945 --> 54:10.849
Come on, we gotta go strategize.

54:10.884 --> 54:13.315
Never give up!
-never surrender.

54:19.563 --> 54:21.863
Losers!

54:26.928 --> 54:29.115
Wait!

54:29.456 --> 54:31.144
Who are you?

54:39.592 --> 54:41.840
Be you..

54:53.717 --> 54:56.586
Did i miss something?

55:10.303 --> 55:13.225
You're gonna pay me or what?

55:20.295 --> 55:22.350
Oh no!

55:24.854 --> 55:26.604
I told you i'm married!

55:26.630 --> 55:28.878
Martha, it's me.
-Charlie!

55:28.998 --> 55:30.426
You scared me!

55:30.470 --> 55:34.150
I'm locked out.
-After the other night, Arthur nailed the mensroom's window shut.

55:34.185 --> 55:36.048
So, how was the party?
-Later..

55:36.135 --> 55:38.516
Arthur, keep him distracted.

55:38.543 --> 55:40.222
Diego!

55:44.055 --> 55:46.268
Hurry, hurry!
-What about my tip?

55:46.303 --> 55:48.035
No!

55:52.208 --> 55:54.325
Hey Arthur, check it out.

55:54.445 --> 55:58.264
Idiot! Straight to bed, you two!
I'm checking on Charlie.

55:58.299 --> 56:01.763
What is this?
This place is a mess.

56:06.411 --> 56:09.317
Arthur, hungry? Thristy?
I made you your favorite.

56:09.352 --> 56:11.347
I'm sure the food at the party
was awful.

56:11.364 --> 56:13.999
No! Thank you!
-I'm thirsty.

56:17.760 --> 56:21.213
Diego! Hurry up!

56:21.519 --> 56:23.243
Come on!

56:23.286 --> 56:25.125
Go!

56:25.160 --> 56:27.950
Arthur, wait wait..

56:27.985 --> 56:29.905
I must ask you something.
-Now?

56:29.923 --> 56:31.462
Yeah.

56:31.550 --> 56:34.305
I need to know something.

56:36.378 --> 56:38.294
Out with it, Diego!

56:38.329 --> 56:40.498
What do you want for breakfast?

56:40.840 --> 56:45.206
The ommelete you had the other day
was very tasty, right?

56:45.232 --> 56:47.857
Yeah sure, it's fine.
Whatever!

56:59.589 --> 57:02.475
Move!
-Move?

57:03.104 --> 57:04.976
This way?

57:05.011 --> 57:06.892
Move!

57:12.606 --> 57:13.988
I didn't hear you knock.

57:14.032 --> 57:16.122
That's because i didn't.

57:37.192 --> 57:38.985
My CD.

57:39.562 --> 57:41.784
No no no..

57:48.057 --> 57:49.054
That's not good.

57:49.081 --> 57:51.612
Dad, if you could just please..
-I don't have time.

57:51.647 --> 57:54.411
Fay Train is thinking about signing with another label.
I have to meet with him.

57:54.429 --> 57:56.239
But this is the Rags guy from the party last night.

57:56.257 --> 57:59.286
Kadee, i am the guy that's always looking
for the next best thing.

57:59.312 --> 58:03.088
But clearly Rags isn't ready for the big time,
or else he wouldn't ran out like he did.

58:03.208 --> 58:05.930
Besides, i'm more concern about you.

58:06.062 --> 58:07.400
Irma tells me you've been missing meetings.

58:07.435 --> 58:09.668
Irma needs to mind her own business.

58:10.350 --> 58:12.301
You're changing the subject.

58:12.329 --> 58:15.645
Rags is amazing, and if you give him a chance
you can see he has a lot to offer..

58:15.688 --> 58:17.630
Kadee, i don't want to talk about Rags anymore.

58:17.665 --> 58:20.421
We're about to launch the biggest record of your carrer,
and you're getting distracted.

58:20.465 --> 58:21.751
And you're not listening.

58:21.777 --> 58:24.821
It's my job to make sure my daughter's head
is on straight.

58:25.092 --> 58:28.982
Your job as my dad or
chairman of Majesty Records?

58:29.909 --> 58:32.183
We'll talk about this when i get back.

58:45.501 --> 58:47.452
No problem.

58:51.013 --> 58:52.806
Hey you!

58:52.850 --> 58:55.247
Hey, kadee.
What are you doing here?

58:55.273 --> 58:57.096
Where were you last night?

58:58.443 --> 59:01.032
Caught a cold, stayed home,
watched a movie.

59:01.093 --> 59:03.098
Really?
What did you watch?

59:04.673 --> 59:08.236
Can't remember the name.
Reese Whiterspoon was in it though..

59:08.356 --> 59:10.947
Cried my eyes out.
-Right.

59:11.341 --> 59:13.387
You're right when you said
you weren't a good liar.

59:13.457 --> 59:14.874
Helps to practice, though.

59:14.918 --> 59:16.790
Anyway, you totally missed out.

59:16.807 --> 59:19.178
I know, i wanted to hear you sing.
-No, not me!

59:19.222 --> 59:21.482
This Rags guy perform,
he killed it!

59:21.534 --> 59:22.873
Really?
-Really!

59:22.890 --> 59:24.701
This guy Rags killed it?

59:24.727 --> 59:26.898
The dude can sing.

59:26.986 --> 59:29.295
And he's not too bad at the kissing stuff either.

59:29.321 --> 59:30.695
He kissed you?

59:30.712 --> 59:33.808
Just laid one on me,
no time to react. Really..

59:33.826 --> 59:36.607
There was nothing i could do.
-Right.

59:37.596 --> 59:39.502
So why did you come here today?

59:39.528 --> 59:41.583
I was hoping you'd be able to help me.

59:42.082 --> 59:43.481
Rags left a CD.

59:43.525 --> 59:45.265
No contact info,
no nothing.

59:45.283 --> 59:48.720
But what he did have was a track of the song
he performed last night..

59:48.746 --> 59:50.513
And this.

59:59.781 --> 01:00:01.792
The song is great.

01:00:01.819 --> 01:00:04.959
That song someday is gonna lead me
straight to Rags.

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.568
Wait, you want to find Rags? Why?

01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:12.327
Charlie, you should have seen him,
he sang about something that was more than I love you, I hate you..

01:00:12.362 --> 01:00:14.523
It was really inspiring.

01:00:19.847 --> 01:00:22.366
Kadee, i should tell you..

01:00:23.118 --> 01:00:25.007
I'm Rags.

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:30.956
He's amazing, Charlie seriously,
you gotta help me find this guy.

01:00:31.076 --> 01:00:35.060
Sometimes it feels like the whole world
wants a piece of Kadee Worth..

01:00:35.987 --> 01:00:37.789
But not you, Charlie.

01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:41.515
Please help me find Rags.

01:00:41.952 --> 01:00:43.693
And how do you plan on finding him?

01:00:43.719 --> 01:00:46.806
That song, you and i are the only two
that have heard it.

01:00:46.833 --> 01:00:49.477
We'll hold an audition.
Whoever sings Someday..

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:51.515
Is the real Rags..

01:00:52.145 --> 01:00:54.061
So are you in, or out?

01:00:55.775 --> 01:00:56.965
In.

01:01:02.373 --> 01:01:03.790
Good job.

01:01:03.825 --> 01:01:06.125
Can i recommend in D minor?

01:01:06.711 --> 01:01:09.014
Oh..

01:01:09.364 --> 01:01:11.218
My God!

01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:14.732
You're her!

01:01:15.449 --> 01:01:16.814
Would you..

01:01:17.409 --> 01:01:21.014
Would you sign this for me?
Please?

01:01:29.468 --> 01:01:31.148
We're up on Perez..

01:01:31.183 --> 01:01:32.547
That's great.

01:01:32.591 --> 01:01:35.292
Guess what? We're on MTV homepage too.

01:01:35.327 --> 01:01:37.225
Nice!

01:01:38.257 --> 01:01:40.417
Guilty Group is having a sample sale.

01:01:40.537 --> 01:01:43.247
Majesty Records will sign the first person
who proved they're Rags.

01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:45.462
We're scouring the internet,
we're holding auditions..

01:01:45.505 --> 01:01:50.124
I know he's out there somewhere, and i won't stop until i find him.
Are you Rags?

01:01:50.466 --> 01:01:51.664
Yes!

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:55.443
Hello?

01:01:56.538 --> 01:01:59.818
Great, she's on her way.
Thank you.

01:01:59.871 --> 01:02:02.757
The venue is available.
-Yes!

01:02:02.801 --> 01:02:04.908
Let's go check it.
Let's go.

01:02:11.451 --> 01:02:13.157
Thanks.

01:02:14.145 --> 01:02:15.869
Who are you texting now?
-I'm not texting.

01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:17.223
I'm tweeting about the Rags audition.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.101
I just hit 7 million followers.

01:02:20.118 --> 01:02:22.375
Seriously? 7 million followers?

01:02:22.392 --> 01:02:24.022
Yeah, how many do you have?

01:02:25.501 --> 01:02:27.600
My gosh, tons.

01:02:27.836 --> 01:02:30.262
So many tweeters..

01:02:30.382 --> 01:02:32.222
Also follow my..

01:02:32.327 --> 01:02:34.400
My tweeting..
-Tweeting?

01:02:34.452 --> 01:02:36.554
You're hilarious.
-You're hilarious.

01:02:36.606 --> 01:02:39.580
You're hilarious.
-No, you're hilarious..

01:02:42.416 --> 01:02:44.673
My bad, i thought that bench was longer.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.991
You're lucky i like you.

01:02:49.691 --> 01:02:51.913
No, i'm Rags!

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.511
This is what is happening.

01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:07.717
There is a mob scene in the lobby.

01:03:07.743 --> 01:03:11.137
Since you were too busy to listen to the CD,
i'm holding auditions to find Rags.

01:03:11.172 --> 01:03:12.834
Yes, Irma has made me aware.

01:03:12.869 --> 01:03:15.236
Kadee, this is a complete fiasco..

01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:19.295
You are putting your music in jeopardy,
and your relationship with Finn.. He's a mess!

01:03:19.339 --> 01:03:21.097
Look at him!

01:03:21.141 --> 01:03:22.473
Relationship?

01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:26.426
This guy Rags is kicking me off all
the magazine covers.

01:03:26.546 --> 01:03:30.001
But more importantly, i miss you.
I miss us.

01:03:30.036 --> 01:03:31.270
We don't talk anymore.

01:03:31.313 --> 01:03:35.075
Because we never talked.
This is a business arrangement.

01:03:35.116 --> 01:03:36.533
And none of you ever listened.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.525
Because you're too busy running around
with that kid.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.834
Who, Charlie?
-See?

01:03:41.869 --> 01:03:44.248
It's cute you're trying to make me jealous.

01:03:44.301 --> 01:03:46.050
She's trying to get my attention.

01:03:46.068 --> 01:03:48.570
I've got it, you're here.
I'm here, hello.

01:03:48.597 --> 01:03:50.547
Kadee, is this true?

01:03:50.591 --> 01:03:53.241
You're totally right, what was i thinking?

01:03:53.285 --> 01:03:57.759
Why would Kadee Worth, the biggest star in the world,
hang out with someone who scrubs the floor i walk on?

01:03:57.802 --> 01:04:00.619
It's not like that. We just want you to focus
on your music.

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:03.658
Yes, your music.

01:04:03.684 --> 01:04:08.786
And us. I think we should do an exclusive
with the Hollywood VIP.

01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:10.492
Why can't you be more grateful?

01:04:10.527 --> 01:04:12.882
Peopla are always telling me
how grateful i should be.

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:16.950
But how can i be grateful when i'm successful
at something that my heart just not in.

01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:23.720
Charlie is cooler than everyone in this building combined.

01:04:23.755 --> 01:04:25.949
And he's gonna help me find Rags.

01:04:25.984 --> 01:04:28.424
We're gonna proof you guys wrong.

01:04:29.159 --> 01:04:31.365
And Finn, here's an exclusive..

01:04:31.485 --> 01:04:33.893
We're done.

01:04:34.795 --> 01:04:38.204
Somone's got her crabby pants on today, right?

01:04:38.247 --> 01:04:42.079
Finn, go make a record or something.

01:04:42.199 --> 01:04:43.513
really?

01:04:50.124 --> 01:04:52.547
No, no!

01:04:52.713 --> 01:04:57.035
Llyod, how many times are you
gonna mess up the snake?

01:04:57.502 --> 01:04:59.723
You're ruining the whole thing.

01:05:00.117 --> 01:05:02.507
You go right and then left.

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:05.787
When your brother goes left and then right.

01:05:08.065 --> 01:05:09.718
Take a break.

01:05:10.243 --> 01:05:12.255
I'm exhausted.

01:05:25.782 --> 01:05:27.424
Need any help?

01:05:27.879 --> 01:05:29.549
Excuse me?

01:05:30.398 --> 01:05:32.873
My dad was yelling at me again.

01:05:32.993 --> 01:05:35.229
I could use some company.

01:05:39.542 --> 01:05:44.513
You know, ever since that Rags guy showed up at the ball,
he's been worse than ever.

01:05:44.565 --> 01:05:46.229
Was Rags really that good?

01:05:46.273 --> 01:05:48.670
Oh yeah, you would have loved him.

01:05:48.696 --> 01:05:52.692
Plus, you're both have the same way of
marking up your shoes.

01:05:54.406 --> 01:05:57.653
Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.
-No way.

01:05:57.671 --> 01:06:01.292
Plus i kinda like it how it makes my dad so angry.

01:06:02.027 --> 01:06:03.837
Can i ask you something?

01:06:04.467 --> 01:06:07.108
Why don't you just tell Kadee?

01:06:07.371 --> 01:06:10.118
She's Kadee Worth,
she can have anybody.

01:06:10.374 --> 01:06:11.529
Maybe she wants you.

01:06:11.555 --> 01:06:16.672
Trust me, Lloyd, no girl's looking for a nobody from a horrible family.

01:06:17.154 --> 01:06:20.469
They want some good looking famous guy
who will be mean to them.

01:06:21.913 --> 01:06:24.096
Girls are weird like that.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.256
What are you doing?

01:06:33.326 --> 01:06:36.151
You never know, until you try.

01:06:36.757 --> 01:06:38.769
Lloyd!
-I can keep picking up these glasses..

01:06:38.804 --> 01:06:42.443
And dropping them on this floor,
until you're telling me you're going for this girl.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.617
Not gonna happen.

01:06:43.652 --> 01:06:45.017
What about the audition?

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:48.432
Obviously Rags won't be showing up,
but that's just how it's gonna have to be.

01:06:49.587 --> 01:06:53.108
No no!
-What is going on?

01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:57.867
Look at all these broken glasses.

01:06:57.937 --> 01:06:58.996
No no no..

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:01.979
This is coming out of your pay.
-You don't pay me.

01:07:03.763 --> 01:07:06.250
Are you ready to focus
and rehearse with your brother?

01:07:06.294 --> 01:07:10.694
Yeah, just making sure this grunt muffin
doesn't break all our glasses.

01:07:10.738 --> 01:07:13.784
That's my boy.
-I'll be right there.

01:07:16.225 --> 01:07:19.717
I'm sorry, i didn't mean to do that.
You know you're not a grunt muffin, right?

01:07:19.761 --> 01:07:22.648
I don't even know what a grunt muffin is.

01:07:24.994 --> 01:07:26.490
Gross.

01:07:26.525 --> 01:07:28.685
What is this stuff?

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.456
Come on!

01:07:53.475 --> 01:07:55.732
What's the cheapest one you got?

01:07:57.515 --> 01:07:59.002
What?

01:07:59.037 --> 01:08:02.334
Something interesting has come up.

01:08:02.597 --> 01:08:04.446
I'll call you back.

01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:06.536
This better be good.

01:08:15.935 --> 01:08:17.473
Nice.

01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:19.581
Nice..

01:08:28.365 --> 01:08:30.301
Excited?
-Nervous.

01:08:30.371 --> 01:08:33.100
I don't know why,
i've been in front of huge crowds.

01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:35.006
I guess this time it's just different.

01:08:35.059 --> 01:08:37.973
Well, i have nothing but fate in you.

01:08:38.174 --> 01:08:40.055
Just be you.

01:08:40.536 --> 01:08:41.490
What?

01:08:41.524 --> 01:08:43.746
Charlie?
-Kadee?

01:08:45.127 --> 01:08:46.685
What are you doing here?

01:08:46.729 --> 01:08:47.707
Auditioning.

01:08:47.769 --> 01:08:49.194
What are you doing here?

01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:51.731
You don't miss an opportunity, do you?

01:08:51.774 --> 01:08:54.871
Dad is looking for you, he said it's important.
He's upstairs.

01:08:55.772 --> 01:08:57.189
Okay.

01:09:08.591 --> 01:09:11.183
You're pretty crafty, Charlie.

01:09:11.305 --> 01:09:15.495
You know, sometimes i think i underestimated you.

01:09:15.854 --> 01:09:19.877
Thanks, though most of the time i think
you just overestimate yourself.

01:09:19.904 --> 01:09:23.131
Hey, i'm trying to be nice here.

01:09:23.822 --> 01:09:25.622
I got something for you.

01:09:25.648 --> 01:09:27.756
Come on, i'll show you.
-Okay.

01:09:27.773 --> 01:09:31.117
My friend Charlie.. Right here.

01:09:31.152 --> 01:09:34.231
Woo.. Hey!

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:36.965
So you think you're a singer, Charlie?

01:09:36.983 --> 01:09:40.035
How dare you try to steal your brothers' dream.

01:09:40.154 --> 01:09:42.604
By they way, i'm selling the Palace.

01:09:42.647 --> 01:09:46.890
They're gonna turn it into an auto-part store,
maybe they need a janitor.

01:09:47.598 --> 01:09:52.752
Now, if you'll excuse me, i have to introduce Andrew to the world as Rags.

01:09:52.796 --> 01:09:54.449
No!

01:09:55.216 --> 01:09:57.332
Where's Charlie?

01:10:02.265 --> 01:10:04.093
I won't let you stop this.

01:10:04.128 --> 01:10:06.210
Who says i'm here to stop this?
-Here to stop this?

01:10:06.227 --> 01:10:08.444
You wanna help me find Rags?

01:10:08.496 --> 01:10:10.543
I'm sorry i haven't been listening to you.

01:10:10.587 --> 01:10:12.634
I need to do that more.

01:10:13.473 --> 01:10:16.827
What happened to my dad?
Is your head on straight?

01:10:16.947 --> 01:10:19.075
I think it finally is.

01:10:23.251 --> 01:10:25.735
And i think that..
-That i'm in love with Irma.

01:10:53.648 --> 01:10:56.220
I'm sorry.
Next.

01:11:01.097 --> 01:11:03.485
I'm sorry..
Next.

01:11:09.578 --> 01:11:11.510
It's done.

01:11:12.285 --> 01:11:17.949
Andrew, consider tonight the first night
of the rest of your career.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:21.888
What about my career?
What about Androyd?

01:11:22.287 --> 01:11:24.936
It's a solo act now, bro.
You're just back up.

01:11:24.999 --> 01:11:27.513
Tonight, i'm Rags.

01:11:27.891 --> 01:11:29.305
What?

01:11:31.503 --> 01:11:33.525
I'm not even surprised.

01:11:38.144 --> 01:11:41.643
Help! Help!
Please help me!

01:11:41.763 --> 01:11:44.529
Trumpet! It's me, go get help boy!

01:11:44.595 --> 01:11:47.358
Go go go!

01:11:50.436 --> 01:11:53.042
I'm bored.

01:11:53.357 --> 01:11:55.702
Bored.

01:11:56.029 --> 01:11:58.570
Let's get out of here.

01:11:59.728 --> 01:12:02.412
People are singing.

01:12:15.204 --> 01:12:20.160
Baby, you're ready to call it quits?
-Not quite yet, dad.

01:12:26.663 --> 01:12:30.718
So, Rags seems to be on the shy side.

01:12:30.838 --> 01:12:34.658
Maybe i'll sing a little and that'll show you how it's done.

01:13:43.263 --> 01:13:44.940
You're Rags?

01:13:44.982 --> 01:13:46.270
You heard the song, didn't you?

01:13:46.312 --> 01:13:49.124
But you sounded so different
at the masquerade party.

01:13:49.197 --> 01:13:52.529
Different lyrics,
and the acoustic here stinks.

01:13:54.281 --> 01:13:55.884
Trumpet, what has gotten into you?

01:13:55.905 --> 01:13:58.933
It's me, please get me out of here!
-Charlie?

01:13:59.053 --> 01:14:02.381
You gotta get me out of here, please help!
-Okay!

01:14:06.133 --> 01:14:08.228
Will this help?
-No.

01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:11.717
I got this.

01:14:14.205 --> 01:14:17.118
I totally help.
-Thank you.

01:14:17.238 --> 01:14:19.109
Go go go..

01:14:19.161 --> 01:14:20.792
Congratulations, i guess.

01:14:20.824 --> 01:14:22.867
My daugther sees something in you.

01:14:22.972 --> 01:14:26.399
And i'm the man of my word,
welcome to Majesty records.

01:14:26.416 --> 01:14:28.612
Thank you.

01:14:30.314 --> 01:14:34.119
The future of Majesty Records,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:14:39.531 --> 01:14:42.221
Looks like you're a little late.

01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:47.532
Sorry Charlie..

01:15:15.691 --> 01:15:17.568
And now..

01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:26.743
Welcome to the subway..

01:15:44.041 --> 01:15:45.653
Hey party pooper.

01:15:45.687 --> 01:15:50.105
You can't leave yet, we haven't introduced Rags, our guest of honor.

01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:52.854
You didn't really think you'd win, did you?

01:15:55.247 --> 01:15:57.828
Charlie, where are you going?

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:02.233
You can't leave.

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.153
Can't stay..

01:16:04.228 --> 01:16:07.004
Sort of done with this place.
- Wait..

01:16:07.124 --> 01:16:09.234
Can you do me a favor before you go?

01:16:09.485 --> 01:16:12.300
Stay while I introduce Rags.

01:16:12.953 --> 01:16:15.099
Couldn't found him without you.

01:16:26.097 --> 01:16:28.087
Excuse me..
Excuse me..

01:16:28.162 --> 01:16:31.406
And first of all thank you all for coming for this celebration.

01:16:31.526 --> 01:16:34.767
It's been a pretty wild ride, hasn't it everybody?
- Yeah..

01:16:34.809 --> 01:16:39.368
And what a crazy ending, who would've thought we'd actually find our Rags..

01:16:39.418 --> 01:16:41.497
But we did.

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:45.307
I knew Rags was incredibly talented the minute i heard him sing.

01:16:45.374 --> 01:16:48.961
I knew its lyrics would inspired others like they inspired me.

01:16:49.078 --> 01:16:53.738
But what took time to realize,
was that his friendship that change me the most.

01:16:54.145 --> 01:16:56.466
So, without further ado..

01:16:56.542 --> 01:16:59.341
Please put your hands together for the real Rags..

01:17:00.586 --> 01:17:03.009
The sign, i made him..

01:17:03.495 --> 01:17:05.948
Mr. Charlie Prince.

01:17:06.501 --> 01:17:07.909
- What?
- What?

01:17:07.968 --> 01:17:08.772
What?

01:17:08.848 --> 01:17:11.426
Charlie, it's time to be you.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:17.507
Well, I'm sure we all enjoy and get laugh but I'm glad to be here and..

01:17:17.524 --> 01:17:19.405
I'm sorry for the confusion everyone..

01:17:19.455 --> 01:17:22.263
Charlie, get your butt up here.

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.718
- How did you know?
- Just be you?

01:17:32.768 --> 01:17:35.654
How could you think I wouldn't figure it out?

01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:45.953
It's your stage, Charlie.

01:17:46.204 --> 01:17:47.881
Take it.

01:19:09.792 --> 01:19:11.465
Wait..wait..

01:19:12.219 --> 01:19:15.580
Look, I'm not the only artist here tonight though, folks.

01:19:15.655 --> 01:19:18.807
As the real Rags, it is my pleasure to give you..

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:21.265
The real Kadee Worth.

01:19:24.333 --> 01:19:26.172
Sing what you've sang to me.

01:19:26.189 --> 01:19:28.712
- Sing your song.
- I can't.

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:30.380
My dad has a plan.

01:19:30.389 --> 01:19:31.621
No sweetheart..

01:19:31.956 --> 01:19:33.701
I wanted to hear your song.

01:21:56.068 --> 01:21:58.239
And boy did i hear you, loud and clear.

01:21:58.359 --> 01:22:00.810
Loud and clear, jinx.

01:22:02.218 --> 01:22:05.652
And from now on, you're in charge in picking your own music.

01:22:06.414 --> 01:22:09.100
And thanks to you all and you Shawn..

01:22:09.318 --> 01:22:11.103
We found our real Rags.

01:22:11.397 --> 01:22:13.442
You're our next big star.

01:22:18.114 --> 01:22:20.120
Well at least we still got the Palace.

01:22:20.171 --> 01:22:22.677
Actually, no you don't.

01:22:22.727 --> 01:22:24.096
What?

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:25.538
What?

01:22:25.588 --> 01:22:26.711
What are you talking about?

01:22:26.745 --> 01:22:29.187
- You know exactly what i'm talking about.
- No Lloyd, don't.

01:22:29.212 --> 01:22:31.006
No, okay?
NO! I..

01:22:31.073 --> 01:22:32.917
I'm done lying for you.

01:22:33.369 --> 01:22:37.278
Your mom didn't leave this place for our dad,
She left it for you, check the deed.

01:22:37.303 --> 01:22:40.256
That is a lie.
You little traitor.

01:22:40.307 --> 01:22:43.028
- I don't..
- This place is yours.

01:22:43.087 --> 01:22:46.867
Charlie, you got your fairytale ending.

01:22:47.424 --> 01:22:49.092
Come here..

01:22:49.922 --> 01:22:52.235
What am i suppose to do now?

01:22:57.446 --> 01:23:00.049
And it's not over yet.

01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:11.318
So maybe life can be like a fairytale after all.

01:26:11.536 --> 01:26:13.348
Do you have a dream?

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:16.014
Do you believe?

01:26:21.306 --> 01:26:26.063
