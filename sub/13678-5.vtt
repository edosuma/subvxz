00:01.252 --> 00:02.545
<i>I don't have
many options.</i>

00:02.629 --> 00:05.799
<i>Someone's closing in on us.
I have to find
out what they know.</i>

00:05.882 --> 00:07.217
What exactly
are you doing?

00:07.300 --> 00:08.593
I'm hacking the FBI.

00:08.677 --> 00:11.471
With the FBI
at Evil Corp,
physical security is madness.

00:11.554 --> 00:13.723
It's Angela.
She's our only option.

00:13.807 --> 00:15.433
Did you talk to the FBI?

00:15.517 --> 00:16.518
<i>This is simple.</i>

00:16.601 --> 00:18.728
<i>I'll give you a small device,
which you'll take to work.</i>

00:18.812 --> 00:22.023
Drop at the Fed's
office on the 23rd floor,
and walk away.

00:22.107 --> 00:23.274
We have
no other options.

00:23.358 --> 00:25.819
The President
can't go to Congress
with a bailout right now.

00:25.902 --> 00:27.487
Let me know when you've
locked up the votes.

00:27.570 --> 00:28.571
And what are you up to?

00:28.655 --> 00:30.323
<i>You're not doing anything
on your end to help.</i>

00:30.407 --> 00:32.158
Yo, yo, yo, yo,
please buy my CD.

00:32.242 --> 00:33.493
<i>He got
into my system.</i>

00:33.576 --> 00:35.912
<i>And he wants me to put
the CD on one of the
computers at work.</i>

00:35.995 --> 00:37.372
Well, I guess I
should pay up, Ahmed,

00:37.455 --> 00:38.707
before I get
lynched over here.

00:39.541 --> 00:41.042
Let me guess,
you're excited.

00:41.126 --> 00:42.919
Yeah, I'm excited.
We get to go to China.

00:45.797 --> 00:47.215
<i>Elliot,
before you get started,</i>

00:47.298 --> 00:50.218
I'm asking you to help me
and not look where
you don't need to.

00:50.301 --> 00:52.345
<i>Are we really
back to this again?</i>

00:52.429 --> 00:54.556
Ray is not some
coffee shop owner.

00:54.639 --> 00:57.142
Forget what you
saw and move on.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.727
Hey! Hey!

01:00.603 --> 01:02.147
<i>We're deep down
inside you, Elliot.</i>

01:02.230 --> 01:04.607
<i>You can't leave us.
And we can't leave you.</i>

01:11.614 --> 01:15.535
<i>You're watching
USA, America's favorite
cable network.</i>

01:56.493 --> 01:57.786
What's happening?

01:58.787 --> 01:59.788
Where are we going?

02:00.371 --> 02:02.707
God, Elliot,
what's your damage?

02:02.791 --> 02:03.792
Cool it, Darlene.

02:03.875 --> 02:06.169
You know your brother
needs our help sometimes.

02:06.252 --> 02:07.545
That boy of ours.

02:08.463 --> 02:09.881
You sure we're
not first cousins?

02:13.885 --> 02:16.012
Where we're going,
Elliot, is a surprise.

02:17.055 --> 02:18.473
Can't say much else.

02:18.556 --> 02:22.602
What I can tell you
is it's a place that
makes everything better.

02:22.685 --> 02:23.978
A place that
changes you.

02:24.062 --> 02:25.396
We should be so lucky.

02:27.732 --> 02:30.568
I have a hunch that
you just might thank me
once we get there.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.863
Why?
What do you mean, why?

02:34.572 --> 02:37.784
This is the annual
Alderson family road trip,
that's why.

02:38.243 --> 02:41.913
With all of us together,
taking on the world,
what could possibly go wrong?

02:44.749 --> 02:45.750
What's that sound?

02:48.253 --> 02:50.797
Say, Elliot,
what's going on
with you and that girl?

02:51.089 --> 02:52.966
I always liked her.
Angela Moss.

02:53.049 --> 02:55.009
Oh, brother,
kill me now.

02:56.553 --> 02:58.763
Me and Angela,
we're friends.

03:00.265 --> 03:01.558
I see how it is.

03:01.683 --> 03:03.643
You two are just gonna
keep stringing us along.

03:03.977 --> 03:07.272
Elliot and Angela,
a regular
will-they-won't-they couple.

03:09.566 --> 03:10.692
Uh-oh.

03:10.775 --> 03:12.485
Sounds like that
cancer's acting up again.

03:13.069 --> 03:14.153
Looks like it, too.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.116
What is that?

03:20.076 --> 03:21.119
That laughing?

03:21.786 --> 03:23.580
Mom, Elliot's
hearing voices.

03:24.122 --> 03:25.331
What else is new?

03:27.959 --> 03:30.753
If you're not careful,
Dad's gonna push you
out a window again.

03:30.879 --> 03:32.046
Pipe down, Darlene.

03:32.463 --> 03:34.424
While I'm alive,
you need to treat
me with respect.

03:34.507 --> 03:35.550
I'm your father.

03:35.633 --> 03:36.676
Not for long.

03:37.010 --> 03:38.803
Ooh.

03:49.647 --> 03:50.648
Eyes up, son.

03:51.941 --> 03:54.319
See, on this
journey of life,

03:54.819 --> 03:56.821
it's best to stay
focused on the road ahead.

03:57.614 --> 03:59.699
Because if you
spend too much time
looking down,

04:00.491 --> 04:02.493
you might just end up
with a crick in your neck.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.502
Nick of time, huh?

05:41.926 --> 05:45.013
What? I can feel
your bug eyes on me.

05:50.768 --> 05:52.186
Can I see your Game Boy?

05:52.270 --> 05:53.688
No way,
you're not allowed.

05:53.771 --> 05:55.481
Your father told
you to look ahead.

05:55.565 --> 05:56.899
And you,
turn that game down.

05:59.318 --> 06:00.486
Are your fingers broken,
young lady?

06:01.029 --> 06:04.032
Not yet, but in this family,
it's only a matter of time.

06:06.075 --> 06:07.160
Ow!

06:07.410 --> 06:10.121
You're burning me.
So what if he hears?

06:12.040 --> 06:14.667
How about being
more useful than your
sack-of-potatoes sister?

06:15.084 --> 06:16.586
Mama needs
a new pack of Slims.

06:17.587 --> 06:19.797
Lights, remember?
I'm watching my figure.

06:34.687 --> 06:37.857
Somebody help me!

06:37.940 --> 06:41.319
Help! Somebody!

06:41.861 --> 06:44.113
I'm trapped in here.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.656
I'm here!

06:50.495 --> 06:51.496
Not so fast, kiddo.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.457
Isn't that...
Nothing but baggage,
sorry to say.

06:54.540 --> 06:55.583
No, no, that was...

06:55.666 --> 06:58.461
We're gonna have to get your
peepers checked as soon
as we get home.

06:59.170 --> 07:02.006
In the meantime,
go do what you got to do.
We shove off in five.

07:18.523 --> 07:19.524
I'm sorry.

07:19.857 --> 07:21.984
Hey, no problem,
E-meister.

07:22.110 --> 07:23.152
Give me four.

07:26.197 --> 07:27.198
Or not.

07:29.784 --> 07:30.952
Can I help you?

07:39.669 --> 07:40.670
I didn't know
you worked here.

07:41.045 --> 07:43.297
Well, I started as
a part-time sales associate.

07:43.881 --> 07:46.551
Then they promoted me
to assistant manager.

07:46.884 --> 07:49.053
Now I'm on pace
to be full manager.

07:49.679 --> 07:51.722
It almost makes up
for them killing my mom.

07:58.479 --> 08:01.190
Come on, son.
Grab what you can.
Cheez-Its, Pringles, Jolt.

08:01.899 --> 08:02.984
What are you doing?

08:03.067 --> 08:05.069
Elliot, stop him or I'm
gonna call the police.

08:13.578 --> 08:15.621
Can't worry about
her anymore, son.

08:15.746 --> 08:18.916
She's one of them.
No, she's not.
She's my friend.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.002
I promise, there are
other fish in the sea.

08:21.085 --> 08:23.004
And if you're
anything like
your old man...

08:26.257 --> 08:28.926
On second thought,
don't be anything
like your old man.

08:33.097 --> 08:35.433
All right, gang,
let's pack it up
and hit the trail.

08:35.516 --> 08:36.517
Together.

08:36.601 --> 08:38.603
Because it's one
for Alderson and...

08:41.272 --> 08:42.607
Alderson for one?

08:59.874 --> 09:01.375
You guys'll
never believe this.

09:01.459 --> 09:03.044
I just had
the most messed-up dream

09:03.127 --> 09:04.754
that Mom slugged
me in the face.

09:10.760 --> 09:11.969
I got to get out of here.

09:15.181 --> 09:16.307
Uh-uh, Buster.

09:17.475 --> 09:19.060
Eyes on the road
in front of you.

09:26.984 --> 09:27.985
Whew.

09:31.989 --> 09:34.825
Well, things suddenly
aren't looking so hot
for the Alderson clan.

09:34.909 --> 09:36.661
You screwed up
another vacation.

09:37.161 --> 09:39.997
All is not yet lost, gang.
I have a donut.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.168
Just have to get it
from underneath my, uh...

09:47.255 --> 09:48.297
Baggage.

09:51.509 --> 09:53.511
Do you really
expect me to believe
there's no one in there?

09:54.178 --> 09:56.639
Elliot, come on.
Not this business again.

09:57.515 --> 09:59.016
You're really starting
to worry me, kiddo.

10:00.268 --> 10:02.937
Did you hit your head
during our little blowout?

10:03.354 --> 10:04.438
Enough of this!

10:04.689 --> 10:06.023
Ooh!

10:07.024 --> 10:08.025
Tell me what's happening.

10:08.818 --> 10:10.528
What is this?

10:12.863 --> 10:14.782
Whoa, that doesn't
sound good.

10:15.199 --> 10:17.451
On the plus side,
I hear jumpsuits
are in these days.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.710
<i>In times of chaos
and uncertainty,</i>

10:25.793 --> 10:27.962
<i>when the world
feels off balance,</i>

10:28.045 --> 10:31.132
<i>we look to those
who've stood with us
from the beginning.</i>

10:31.215 --> 10:34.010
<i>Since 1884,
we've had America's back.</i>

10:34.552 --> 10:37.346
<i>We may get knocked down,
but we'll never
get knocked out.</i>

10:37.888 --> 10:40.016
<i>Still on your side.</i>

10:43.394 --> 10:46.814
Stay calm, collected.
Follow my lead.
It'll always work out.

10:50.401 --> 10:51.402
Car trouble, huh?

10:52.236 --> 10:53.904
He's on to us.
Run for it.

10:55.239 --> 10:58.242
Gideon, you're alive.

10:58.326 --> 11:03.331
You folks haven't seen a clan
of outlaws with a kidnapped
corporate exec, have you?

11:04.582 --> 11:05.666
Yikes!

11:13.257 --> 11:14.717
I kill me!

11:40.451 --> 11:41.577
You seem upset, son.

11:42.203 --> 11:45.706
Seriously,
Elliot, it's been forever
since that poor cop passed.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.626
It's been 12 seconds.

11:49.919 --> 11:51.545
It's time to
move past it.

11:51.629 --> 11:52.671
The future is bright.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.508
Endless, like that
horizon out there.

11:57.593 --> 12:01.305
Whatever you're doing
with me, I don't care.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.681
Just take me back.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.183
It's not
that simple, kiddo.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.267
Whoa!

12:07.853 --> 12:09.480
Someone help me!

12:10.856 --> 12:12.274
I'm a businessman!

12:13.150 --> 12:15.069
A very important
businessman...

12:33.838 --> 12:36.006
You gonna tell me
why you took him?

12:37.883 --> 12:41.011
First, you're hearing voices.
Now, you're seeing things.

12:43.681 --> 12:45.391
He's right
in front of us.

12:47.059 --> 12:48.310
We're staring at him!

12:48.394 --> 12:50.479
Am I the only one
here who isn't?

13:02.700 --> 13:04.326
It'll feel good
if you let it.

13:05.244 --> 13:07.371
Believing it's
real makes it so.

13:12.418 --> 13:13.961
Come on,
grab him by the loafers.

13:14.044 --> 13:15.421
Oh, please, gentlemen.

13:15.546 --> 13:16.630
Ankles instead?

13:16.714 --> 13:18.716
The shoes,
they're Ferragamo.

13:30.728 --> 13:31.729
Hyah!

13:44.742 --> 13:46.076
The laughing.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.081
It's a lie.

13:53.918 --> 13:55.920
Sometimes lies can
be useful, Elliot.

13:57.087 --> 13:58.339
Sometimes,
they protect you.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.424
And sometimes,
they help you get
away with murder.

14:06.263 --> 14:07.389
When the truth
is painful, son,

14:07.473 --> 14:09.308
and it often is,

14:09.433 --> 14:11.310
a lie is the only remedy.

14:11.435 --> 14:14.772
Because too much truth,
too much honesty,
that'll kill you.

14:18.943 --> 14:20.611
This whole place
is a lie.

14:23.155 --> 14:24.990
Nothing here is true.

14:29.078 --> 14:30.162
Listen,

14:30.287 --> 14:33.123
I know your gut's
saying not to trust me.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.169
But look around.

14:39.964 --> 14:41.298
Everything you see,

14:43.634 --> 14:45.302
it's all here
for you.

14:47.805 --> 14:49.265
To help you.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.978
You should try just
going along with it.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.527
This is it.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.654
Isn't it?

15:05.864 --> 15:07.283
You've won.

15:08.993 --> 15:10.995
You've taken over.

15:11.495 --> 15:13.330
What's that, kiddo?

15:17.668 --> 15:19.503
That's what this is.

15:22.131 --> 15:24.341
This road trip.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.846
This family vacation.

15:33.684 --> 15:35.728
I'm buried here.

15:41.525 --> 15:44.028
Well, I'll let you
in on a little secret.

15:45.154 --> 15:47.323
This is just temporary.

15:49.074 --> 15:51.327
We did always
have a destination.

15:59.043 --> 16:02.838
After the beating you took,
at least they got
you to a doctor.

16:08.886 --> 16:11.263
You got yourself
pretty messed up.

16:13.223 --> 16:16.393
If I were alive,
I'd want no part
of that agony.

16:20.105 --> 16:21.982
Nobody's won
anything, Elliot.

16:22.066 --> 16:23.901
Especially not me.

16:26.111 --> 16:29.323
I'm just trying
to help you put it
all in the rearview.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.450
As painlessly
as possible.

16:36.246 --> 16:37.748
Bring her in, kiddo.

16:46.423 --> 16:49.176
<i>Now that
the worst is behind you,</i>

16:49.259 --> 16:50.761
<i>it's time we get you back.</i>

17:10.823 --> 17:12.116
Maxine.

17:13.117 --> 17:14.326
My dog.

17:17.121 --> 17:19.957
Started to develop
a cough two weeks ago.

17:21.542 --> 17:23.127
She got pretty
frail pretty quick.

17:23.961 --> 17:25.838
Fell over
a few times.

17:27.297 --> 17:28.507
According to the vet,

17:29.466 --> 17:32.469
she danced with
the wrong mosquito,
got herself a...

17:33.178 --> 17:34.972
Nasty case
of heartworm.

17:36.473 --> 17:39.727
She was moved to a little room
off the basement.

17:39.810 --> 17:41.979
Had a water heater
for a roommate.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.982
Before she got sick,

17:45.065 --> 17:47.317
Maxine lived like
her own operator.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.738
Didn't seem to cross her mind
that she belonged to someone.

17:53.824 --> 17:55.909
But in that basement,
she needed human hands

17:55.993 --> 17:59.246
to give her every scrap
of food, every pill.

18:01.665 --> 18:03.250
Occasional light.

18:15.846 --> 18:18.056
For the first time,
she realized

18:20.392 --> 18:23.854
that she continued
to breathe because
someone else allowed it.

18:25.606 --> 18:27.524
That she had a master.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.612
Now, I'm no vet.

18:33.530 --> 18:35.449
But I think that realization
might have killed her

18:35.532 --> 18:37.868
before the parasites
had the chance.

18:42.706 --> 18:43.874
Anyway,

18:44.750 --> 18:47.795
I'm gonna quit yapping,
let you rest.

18:48.879 --> 18:50.672
Big days ahead.

18:50.756 --> 18:52.132
Work to do.

19:01.892 --> 19:02.976
<i>We can sit
here and complain,</i>

19:03.060 --> 19:05.979
<i>or we can go out
there and enjoy ourselves.</i>

19:06.063 --> 19:07.689
<i>I'm gonna sit
here and complain.</i>

19:09.399 --> 19:12.653
<i>Well, not everyone
enjoys spending their
vacation in a rain forest.</i>

19:12.736 --> 19:14.988
<i>We're in this rain
forest because of you.</i>

19:15.072 --> 19:16.323
<i>I vote we go home.</i>

19:16.406 --> 19:17.616
<i>You're not voting on this.</i>

19:17.741 --> 19:20.077
<i>Call the newspapers.
Democracy is dead.</i>

19:27.960 --> 19:29.711
<i>It's been two days
since the shocking</i>

19:29.795 --> 19:32.548
<i>terror attack at
Beijing's Bayi Lake Hotel,</i>

19:32.631 --> 19:35.217
<i>and while the exact death toll
has yet to be released,</i>

19:35.300 --> 19:36.552
<i>an anonymous source...</i>

19:36.635 --> 19:38.762
Owning the FBI
was never gonna be easy.

19:39.429 --> 19:42.683
But now,
everyone's on high alert.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.268
We'll be fine.

19:45.936 --> 19:47.396
We only have
one day.

19:47.479 --> 19:49.273
I mean, you heard
what Angela said.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.733
An interoffice e-mail
stating that the FBI's

19:51.817 --> 19:54.152
CART team is vacating
E Corp tomorrow.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.363
And we don't have a shot
once they're back
at the field office.

19:56.446 --> 19:57.614
She'll be ready.

19:58.282 --> 19:59.491
Darlene.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.368
We just started
teaching her.

20:01.451 --> 20:02.619
For someone like Angela,

20:03.370 --> 20:07.332
learning all this in 24 hours
is next to impossible.

20:07.875 --> 20:08.959
Uh...

20:09.042 --> 20:10.127
That?

20:13.005 --> 20:15.382
Okay, uh,
you know what?

20:15.465 --> 20:17.009
It's pause, um...

20:17.134 --> 20:21.263
Maybe you need to...
Sometimes, it helps
to visualize it, okay?

20:21.346 --> 20:22.389
So here.

20:23.473 --> 20:26.727
Your network cable
is gonna be plugged
into one of these suckers.

20:26.810 --> 20:29.563
That's a battery-powered
home-brewed mobile tower

20:29.646 --> 20:30.814
called a femtocell.

20:30.898 --> 20:33.317
Now, this guy won't help us
get on the FBI network.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.360
That won't be
accessible at E Corp.

20:36.069 --> 20:40.073
What this guy will do
is force every FBI
cell phone to connect to it

20:40.157 --> 20:44.161
so we can get every e-mail,
text message and document.

20:44.745 --> 20:48.749
Now, you SSH in,
run the first script.

20:48.832 --> 20:51.919
Period, forward slash,

20:52.920 --> 20:55.923
"EnableAttack," space,

20:56.006 --> 20:58.759
"femtopwn," space,

20:58.842 --> 21:00.677
"WLAN0," comma,

21:00.761 --> 21:03.847
"WLAN1," space, "2."

21:04.014 --> 21:04.973
No...

21:05.057 --> 21:06.099
Uh...

21:06.183 --> 21:07.851
That's...

21:08.685 --> 21:09.770
Yeah.

21:10.354 --> 21:11.980
I will get this.

21:12.064 --> 21:13.106
Let's just try it again.

21:13.857 --> 21:14.900
Mmm-hmm.

21:15.943 --> 21:16.985
Um...

21:18.862 --> 21:21.365
Okay. This is
a Rubber Ducky.

21:22.199 --> 21:25.786
All else fails,
you find an FBI laptop
anywhere on the floor.

21:25.869 --> 21:28.080
They're usually
Panasonic Toughbooks.

21:28.163 --> 21:29.122
Plug this guy in,

21:29.206 --> 21:31.500
wait 15 seconds,
then yank it. Okay?

21:32.042 --> 21:33.543
Thanks to a tool
called Mimikatz,

21:33.669 --> 21:35.545
it'll pull all
cached passwords

21:35.712 --> 21:37.547
and domain info in
and save them on this.

21:37.673 --> 21:40.884
Won't give us everything
but might help
lead us somewhere.

21:41.426 --> 21:43.720
Just a backup plan.

21:43.845 --> 21:46.390
Okay. Let's try again.

21:46.515 --> 21:50.268
You can't teach someone
to hack in one day, okay?

21:50.394 --> 21:51.561
I don't know how we'll
be ready by tomorrow.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.563
We need more time.
Well, we don't
have it.

21:53.689 --> 21:56.191
And once they leave
E Corp, we're done.

21:56.274 --> 21:59.236
Okay? Just keep
working on the scripts
with Angela.

21:59.361 --> 22:03.073
Rinse and repeat,
again and again.
Wax on, wax off.

22:03.198 --> 22:05.993
Do whatever you got to do,
but this is happening.

22:06.076 --> 22:09.788
Okay,
the holdup on the femtocell
isn't helping either, okay?

22:09.913 --> 22:11.790
I still need to
load the exploit,
I need to test it...

22:11.915 --> 22:13.333
It'll be here.

22:13.417 --> 22:16.086
Cisco's still modding
and swapping antennas.

22:28.223 --> 22:29.307
Careful man!

22:30.100 --> 22:31.893
We kinda need this.

22:33.145 --> 22:35.605
It's been examined
and approved.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.570
Told you already,

22:41.653 --> 22:43.447
I checked it myself.

22:44.406 --> 22:48.076
By not taking my word,
he's wasted valuable time.

22:52.456 --> 22:54.249
You gotta give me something.

22:55.250 --> 22:57.419
Come on, man.

22:57.961 --> 22:58.962
These are my friends.

22:59.087 --> 23:00.922
I don't want to put
them in danger.

23:03.467 --> 23:05.761
I want our employer
to be happy,

23:06.303 --> 23:10.015
but I also need to know
what's going on.

23:10.307 --> 23:12.726
What were you looking for?

23:12.809 --> 23:15.520
What did you do to this?

23:22.110 --> 23:24.362
Really, man?
I thought we were
on the same team.

23:24.488 --> 23:26.865
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, no.

23:26.990 --> 23:30.285
What the fuck, Xun?
What the fuck is going on?

23:30.368 --> 23:34.122
Get off me, man!
Xun, what the hell's going on?

23:34.206 --> 23:37.209
Xun! Xun! Just wait!
The fuck is going on, man?

23:37.709 --> 23:39.503
What the fuck
is going on, man?

23:40.045 --> 23:42.339
Get off me.
Get off me.

23:42.464 --> 23:45.342
Fuck. Get off me, man.

23:45.509 --> 23:47.928
You seem to have forgotten
where your loyalties lie.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.262
This will help you remember.

23:49.346 --> 23:51.807
No, no, stop, stop, stop.
No, no, no.

23:51.890 --> 23:53.141
Stop, stop, stop!

23:53.225 --> 23:54.935
Don't ask questions

23:56.103 --> 23:58.772
You are a foot soldier.

23:59.940 --> 24:01.483
And foot soldiers do
one very simple thing,

24:05.320 --> 24:07.405
They follow orders.

24:13.662 --> 24:16.665
<i>Agent Ramos
recommends four weeks'
psych leave.</i>

24:17.541 --> 24:20.377
And you know
I don't take his
evaluations lightly.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.840
You were also there.

24:26.007 --> 24:27.676
I was in my room.

24:27.759 --> 24:29.177
I got lucky.

24:30.011 --> 24:32.347
You were smack in the middle.
You owe yourself some time.

24:32.430 --> 24:34.391
I can't go away
for a month.

24:34.516 --> 24:35.559
I won't.

24:36.393 --> 24:38.728
We disrupt the investigation,
the Dark Army wins.

24:38.854 --> 24:40.730
Chinese are pointing
to a group of
Uighur separatists.

24:40.856 --> 24:42.440
I told you what I
saw at the airport.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.025
What you saw
doesn't mean anything.

24:44.109 --> 24:46.403
Excuse me, but I disagree.

24:46.528 --> 24:49.698
We were there to
investigate the hack
and then we were under fire.

24:49.781 --> 24:50.949
That is not a coincidence.

24:51.074 --> 24:54.369
By all reports,
the Dark Army
are just hackers.

24:54.953 --> 24:58.165
It's not their MO
to shoot up a hotel
teeming with FBI.

24:58.248 --> 25:01.501
Violent separatists
would have taken more victims.

25:01.585 --> 25:03.420
I clipped one of
the shooters in the leg.

25:03.545 --> 25:04.796
He went down, hit the floor.

25:04.880 --> 25:05.922
He could have kept firing.

25:05.964 --> 25:09.718
I read the reports,
DiPierro.
He turned the gun on himself.

25:09.801 --> 25:11.428
He erased his history.

25:12.554 --> 25:15.515
And the other shooter
actually had me cornered.

25:15.599 --> 25:17.267
I was done.

25:17.392 --> 25:19.186
Swear to God.

25:19.269 --> 25:21.062
But instead, for some reason,

25:21.146 --> 25:24.065
he also put his
weapon to his head
and pulled the trigger.

25:25.275 --> 25:26.693
Their mission
wasn't to slaughter us.

25:26.776 --> 25:29.821
If it was, I wouldn't be here
arguing with you right now.

25:29.946 --> 25:32.032
They were there to
disrupt our investigation,

25:32.115 --> 25:34.784
to send us home,
and to leave nothing behind.

25:37.287 --> 25:38.288
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

25:38.413 --> 25:40.624
<i>Everyone's emotional
because of this Beijing thing.</i>

25:40.749 --> 25:42.292
<i>Revenge is on
everyone's mind.</i>

25:42.417 --> 25:44.211
<i>The drums of war.
I know you hear them.</i>

25:44.294 --> 25:46.421
Be that as it may,
Mr. Speaker,

25:46.504 --> 25:48.548
there are ways
to drown them out.

25:48.632 --> 25:51.468
With enough passion,
people will buy into anything,

25:51.593 --> 25:53.803
especially at
times like these.

25:53.929 --> 25:55.347
<i>The Chinese tied
our hands on this one.</i>

25:55.931 --> 25:58.183
<i>If I try to advocate
borrowing from them now,</i>

25:58.266 --> 26:00.435
<i>the American public
will call me a traitor.</i>

26:00.518 --> 26:03.647
<i>And, Phillip, frankly,
I don't even know if
I disagree with them.</i>

26:03.730 --> 26:05.523
Don't shit a shitter, John.

26:06.066 --> 26:08.235
You enter this
pissing contest with China

26:08.318 --> 26:10.403
instead of
passing this bailout,

26:10.487 --> 26:12.322
the country goes bankrupt.

26:13.323 --> 26:15.325
<i>Believe me,
I would if I could.</i>

26:15.408 --> 26:16.910
<i>But a bailout...</i>

26:16.993 --> 26:19.496
<i>No one can make that happen,
not in this climate.</i>

26:19.579 --> 26:20.580
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

26:23.333 --> 26:25.335
Minister Zhang's office
has been unreachable.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.047
That cocksucker.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.133
Well, call him again.

26:32.217 --> 26:34.511
And again and again
and again.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.930
And don't fucking
leave until you get him.

26:39.599 --> 26:42.227
Where's my car?
I'm late for my
next appointment.

26:42.352 --> 26:43.812
Sorry, sir.

26:43.895 --> 26:46.398
The driver's having
trouble getting into
the parking structure.

26:47.065 --> 26:48.900
Protesters have
surrounded the building.

26:56.449 --> 27:00.287
Tell Bratton to
summon as much NYPD
as is necessary.

27:11.298 --> 27:13.883
My success is assured.

27:15.385 --> 27:17.637
My success is assured.

27:18.972 --> 27:21.474
My success is assured.

27:22.559 --> 27:24.644
My success is assured.

27:25.729 --> 27:28.273
My success is assured.

27:31.276 --> 27:33.320
My success is assured.

27:34.904 --> 27:39.075
You know you can't talk
to yourself during the
actual operation, right?

27:39.159 --> 27:42.537
Whatever it takes,
as long as you're
almost ready for liftoff.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.789
We settled on Midtown, JW?

27:44.914 --> 27:46.624
Twenty-third floor,
Eastside View.

27:46.750 --> 27:48.168
This'll be during
their lunch hour,

27:48.251 --> 27:49.544
so the floor
should be pretty empty.

27:49.627 --> 27:51.087
Okay.

27:52.172 --> 27:54.090
We're officially
good to go.

28:05.435 --> 28:07.270
The hell is this?

28:26.331 --> 28:27.665
Nothing.

28:28.792 --> 28:32.212
I thought I recognized
your friend, but I don't.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.803
I'll wait for your
call when I get there.

28:45.058 --> 28:48.144
Jesus.
At least you still got
a few of these left.

28:49.354 --> 28:51.773
I cannot get through
a day in that E Corp
building without juicing.

28:51.856 --> 28:53.316
You know what I mean?

28:58.071 --> 29:00.490
Hey, how soon
till you re-up on, um...

29:03.660 --> 29:05.036
Everything?

29:05.829 --> 29:07.664
Oh, well, that's it
for this place.

29:08.498 --> 29:11.000
I thought I could
weather the storm,
but that's...

29:12.168 --> 29:13.211
I can't.

29:16.923 --> 29:20.844
I know it's rough out there,
but you're a survivor, Ahmed.

29:22.679 --> 29:24.848
Yeah, well, not when
I can't pay the rent.

29:25.682 --> 29:28.476
With this cash allowance,
no one's coming in.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.562
No customers,
no inventory.

29:31.187 --> 29:34.524
No more of the best
damn turkey sandwich
in the tri-state.

29:35.233 --> 29:36.401
Yeah.

29:39.737 --> 29:41.406
Man, I'm real sorry.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.200
Yeah. Thanks.

29:48.788 --> 29:52.625
Well, I guess I
got to take advantage
while I still can, right?

29:54.294 --> 29:55.753
How about it?

29:56.546 --> 29:58.089
Turkey sandwich
on whole wheat.

29:58.423 --> 29:59.466
Oh.

29:59.549 --> 30:00.884
Yeah, okay.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.552
Lettuce, mayo,
Muenster.

30:41.257 --> 30:43.635
Yeah, hi,
I'm in room 2301.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.178
I just used
my last towel.

30:45.261 --> 30:46.846
I'm running out for
a sec but was wondering

30:46.930 --> 30:49.599
if someone could leave
a few extras by my door.

30:50.099 --> 30:51.434
Thank you.

30:56.105 --> 30:57.982
Oh, hi.

30:58.107 --> 30:59.734
Oh, there's no
conditioner in my room,

30:59.817 --> 31:02.153
and I'm sure
gonna need it
with this humidity.

31:02.278 --> 31:03.571
You know how it is.

31:06.658 --> 31:07.784
Thanks, doll.

32:13.558 --> 32:15.351
<i>Are we
still on for lunch?</i>

32:16.144 --> 32:17.353
Yeah, I'll be there.

33:07.904 --> 33:08.946
How's it going?

33:43.481 --> 33:44.607
Shit.

33:57.412 --> 33:58.788
Shit.

33:58.913 --> 33:59.997
<i>What's up?</i>

34:00.123 --> 34:01.708
The script,
it isn't working.

34:01.791 --> 34:02.875
<i>Mobley, are you on?</i>

34:02.959 --> 34:04.794
<i>Yeah,
what's on your terminal?</i>

34:05.586 --> 34:07.714
"EnableAttack not found."

34:11.801 --> 34:13.136
<i>Everything okay?</i>

34:16.013 --> 34:17.765
<i>Angela, what's happening?</i>

34:22.812 --> 34:24.021
<i>Angela.</i>

34:28.693 --> 34:29.819
<i>I'm good.</i>

34:30.486 --> 34:32.238
<i>Okay,
you have to change your path.</i>

34:32.321 --> 34:34.449
<i>"CD, bin, " hit Enter.</i>

34:35.867 --> 34:37.660
<i>Done.
Now run the script.</i>

34:41.664 --> 34:43.750
<i>And we are live.</i>

34:43.833 --> 34:46.669
<i>Wi-Fi interface is up.
Communicating with femtocell.</i>

34:47.795 --> 34:50.047
<i>Good work.
Almost there. Do your thing.</i>

34:53.176 --> 34:54.719
Is everything okay?

34:54.844 --> 34:56.721
<i>Who the hell is that?</i>

34:56.846 --> 34:59.223
Yeah. Fine.

34:59.348 --> 35:01.017
You were
in there a while.

35:02.018 --> 35:03.978
I didn't mean for
that to sound weird.

35:04.061 --> 35:06.856
I just noticed
because I've never seen you
on this floor before.

35:08.316 --> 35:10.651
I wanted to make sure
you're all right is all.

35:10.735 --> 35:12.320
<i>We don't
have time for this.
Get rid of him.</i>

35:12.403 --> 35:14.906
Anyway,
I'm Agent Ross Thomas, CY-5.

35:17.366 --> 35:19.243
<i>Mobley, you're getting
the transfers, right?</i>

35:19.368 --> 35:20.828
<i>Anything?</i>

35:20.912 --> 35:21.913
Angela.

35:22.038 --> 35:24.957
<i>He hails
from San Diego,
relationship is complicated.</i>

35:25.041 --> 35:26.709
So what's it like?

35:27.710 --> 35:29.337
Knowing that every
room you walk into,

35:29.420 --> 35:31.297
at least one person
is quietly trying to

35:31.380 --> 35:33.341
muster the courage
to ask you out?

35:33.424 --> 35:36.344
<i>Jesus,
end this before I hurl.</i>

35:36.427 --> 35:37.762
<i>Mobley.</i>

35:37.887 --> 35:42.016
<i>He's been in
the Bureau for under a year.
Was InfoSec before then.</i>

35:42.099 --> 35:43.768
I don't really
think about that.

35:43.893 --> 35:45.269
<i>I don't have much yet.</i>

35:45.394 --> 35:49.440
Well, would you think
about drinks with me?

35:49.565 --> 35:51.943
Say, tomorrow night?

35:52.068 --> 35:53.903
I'm actually
seeing someone.

35:54.028 --> 35:55.822
Oh, come on.
I'm not proposing.

35:55.905 --> 35:57.448
It's one drink.

35:58.449 --> 35:59.617
I won't take no
for an answer.

35:59.700 --> 36:00.743
I'm flattered.

36:00.868 --> 36:02.370
But I really have
to get back to work.

36:02.453 --> 36:05.790
<i>I've got something.
He calls his mom
a weird amount,</i>

36:05.915 --> 36:08.793
<i>and I will
exploit that weirdness.</i>

36:08.918 --> 36:11.921
This floor, it's off-limits
to non-Bureau.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.215
Did you know that?

36:14.757 --> 36:16.425
I thought you all
were moving.

36:22.431 --> 36:25.560
Well? You want to
tell me why you're here?

36:26.435 --> 36:29.021
<i>Shit, Mobley,
I'm looking too.</i>

36:29.105 --> 36:31.107
<i>Angela, hold on a sec.</i>

36:32.233 --> 36:33.734
I'm waiting.

36:34.610 --> 36:36.195
So that's all you got?

36:37.446 --> 36:39.699
A little brush-off
and you give up?

36:42.451 --> 36:44.620
I just wanted
a little fight.

36:44.745 --> 36:46.789
No one's ever
handed a win.

36:52.128 --> 36:53.629
What are you doing
for lunch?

36:54.463 --> 36:56.257
Busy tomorrow, but...

36:57.300 --> 36:59.135
I can meet you
downstairs.

37:00.219 --> 37:01.804
Like, 30?

37:07.101 --> 37:09.395
I know a great Greek
place around the corner.

37:11.939 --> 37:13.816
I'll see you in a half.

37:19.488 --> 37:20.740
<i>All right,
you need to find a cubicle</i>

37:20.823 --> 37:21.908
<i>with a network
switch under it.</i>

37:21.991 --> 37:25.494
<i>It should be on the ground.
Lots of Ethernet
cables and flashing LEDs.</i>

37:45.348 --> 37:47.099
Okay, found one.

37:47.183 --> 37:50.269
<i>All right,
put the battery backup down
and the femtocell next to it.</i>

37:50.353 --> 37:52.605
<i>Plug the battery
backup into a power strip.</i>

37:52.688 --> 37:56.108
<i>Do not unplug the femtocell
from the battery backup.</i>

37:56.192 --> 37:59.779
<i>After that, plug the other end
of the yellow network
cable into the switch.</i>

38:10.039 --> 38:12.541
<i>Don't forget to
wipe your prints
from everything.</i>

38:47.076 --> 38:49.203
<i>Okay,
the femtocell's plugged in.</i>

38:54.583 --> 38:55.584
You killed it.

38:56.252 --> 38:57.753
<i>Go celebrate.</i>

39:04.593 --> 39:05.720
Shit.

39:09.765 --> 39:11.350
We lost Wi-Fi.

39:11.434 --> 39:13.352
You need to get to a terminal
and bring it back up.

39:16.105 --> 39:18.107
Screw you.
I did what you asked.

39:18.232 --> 39:19.442
<i>If we can't get
the interface to load,</i>

39:19.567 --> 39:22.194
<i>then we can't use
the Juniper ScreenOS
backdoor to own the network,</i>

39:22.278 --> 39:23.362
<i>which means,</i>

39:23.446 --> 39:26.032
<i>I can't wipe the
security footage of you
planting the femtocell.</i>

39:26.115 --> 39:27.450
You're fucking kidding me.

39:27.533 --> 39:29.952
<i>Just get to your cubicle.
I'll walk you through it.</i>

39:51.640 --> 39:54.310
<i>Masters.
We all have them.</i>

39:54.810 --> 39:57.813
<i>Every relationship's
a power struggle.</i>

39:57.938 --> 40:00.066
<i>Some of us need
to be controlled.</i>

40:01.317 --> 40:05.905
<i>Once in a while,
the best course of action
is to just ride shotgun,</i>

40:06.947 --> 40:08.741
<i>stare at the road ahead,</i>

40:08.824 --> 40:11.160
<i>and hope it leads
somewhere you want to go.</i>

40:21.670 --> 40:23.756
<i>There's a USB flash
drive in that bag.</i>

40:23.839 --> 40:25.674
<i>When you get to your cubicle,
power off your machine,</i>

40:25.758 --> 40:28.177
<i>plug the flash drive in,
and power it back on.</i>

40:29.261 --> 40:31.263
<i>Hold F12 to bring
up your boot options.</i>

40:31.347 --> 40:33.307
<i>Make sure you boot from USB.</i>

40:37.311 --> 40:41.690
<i>Make sure live
AMD64 is highlighted,
then hit Enter.</i>

40:42.775 --> 40:45.611
<i>When the desktop comes up,
open a terminal.</i>

40:45.694 --> 40:48.697
<i>Click on the icon
of the black screen,
just like you practiced.</i>

40:50.282 --> 40:52.618
<i>Okay, I need you to
type the following,</i>

40:52.701 --> 40:54.787
<i>"SSH, " space,</i>

40:54.870 --> 40:57.706
<i>dash, "L, " space, "root, "</i>

40:57.832 --> 41:00.376
<i>space, "L4713</i>

41:02.044 --> 41:05.381
<i>"1 16.e-corp-usa.com."</i>

41:17.226 --> 41:18.727
I lost my place.

41:19.562 --> 41:21.147
The last thing I
entered was "3."

41:21.230 --> 41:25.234
<i>"1 16.e-corp-usa.com."</i>

41:27.403 --> 41:29.989
Okay.
<i>Okay, password, "Joshua."</i>

41:31.991 --> 41:35.161
<i>Homestretch,
you're gonna have to bring up
both Wi-Fi interfaces.</i>

41:35.244 --> 41:37.163
<i>"Ifconfig, " space,</i>

41:37.246 --> 41:39.832
<i>"WLAN0, " space, "up."</i>

41:39.915 --> 41:41.917
Done.
<i>Last one.</i>

41:42.001 --> 41:44.170
<i>"Ifconfig, " space,</i>

41:44.253 --> 41:47.006
<i>"WLAN1, " space, "up."</i>

41:47.089 --> 41:48.549
Angela Moss.

41:49.675 --> 41:50.926
Is that right?

41:55.931 --> 41:58.434
Oh, you in the middle
of a call? I'm sorry.

41:59.268 --> 42:02.104
I hate when people do
that to me. Go ahead.
I can wait for you to finish.

43:15.094 --> 43:17.346
Before you get all
bent out of shape,

43:18.222 --> 43:20.891
all I was trying to do
was take those
punches for you.

43:20.975 --> 43:22.017
That's it.

43:38.575 --> 43:40.160
Thank you.

44:15.446 --> 44:17.281
So if I had to guess,

44:19.033 --> 44:22.161
I'd say you didn't tell
Principal Howard your side?

44:27.791 --> 44:31.670
You know, it's okay
to talk about stuff,
to share your side of things.

44:34.506 --> 44:36.342
I'm here to listen.

44:36.425 --> 44:38.052
Always will be.

44:39.887 --> 44:42.639
You don't feel like
talking right now,

44:42.723 --> 44:44.058
nobody's gonna force you.

44:51.774 --> 44:54.485
Hopefully you're
okay with listening,
though, because...

44:55.652 --> 44:58.197
I actually have
something to share.

44:59.323 --> 45:01.325
Something I'm
pretty embarrassed about.

45:03.827 --> 45:06.580
Mr. Fitch, my supervisor,

45:06.663 --> 45:09.166
you met him, big bald guy,

45:09.249 --> 45:12.169
looks like that
guy from <i>The Simpsons</i>
that you don't like very much.

45:14.004 --> 45:17.216
A few Fridays ago,
he calls me into his office,
sits me down,

45:17.299 --> 45:20.594
and immediately starts
reading off a list of dates.

45:22.179 --> 45:25.682
"September 8th,
August 29th, August 2nd."

45:27.226 --> 45:28.602
Few more.

45:30.229 --> 45:33.190
He goes on to tell me
that because of these dates,

45:35.192 --> 45:37.361
my contract is
being terminated.

45:39.571 --> 45:41.782
I was being let go.

45:41.865 --> 45:43.659
I asked him why.

45:43.742 --> 45:44.785
He didn't answer.

45:44.868 --> 45:47.079
He just thanked
me for my time,
wished me luck,

45:47.871 --> 45:50.999
excused himself,
no further explanation.

45:54.378 --> 45:55.838
What were the dates?

45:58.507 --> 46:00.676
They were all
appointments with a doctor.

46:02.177 --> 46:05.556
I had to leave early
for some blood work.

46:08.392 --> 46:09.726
What? What do you mean?

46:12.980 --> 46:14.606
I'm sick, Elliot.

46:15.566 --> 46:17.401
That's what
they're telling me.

46:17.484 --> 46:18.986
For a while now.

46:22.156 --> 46:25.159
I've been trying to
keep it from everybody.

46:25.242 --> 46:28.579
Your mom, Darlene, work.

46:29.997 --> 46:31.165
You.

46:39.506 --> 46:41.300
Come on, kiddo.

46:42.092 --> 46:44.511
The world isn't gonna
get rid of me that easily.

46:45.721 --> 46:46.930
I'm gonna be okay.

46:50.517 --> 46:52.269
I'm never gonna leave you.

46:53.562 --> 46:54.938
I promise.

46:59.526 --> 47:02.946
Oh, come on. Enough of
this gloom and doom.

47:04.656 --> 47:08.994
Why dwell on the past
when we can take
a peek into the future?

47:10.120 --> 47:12.206
The site of
my new gig.

47:13.499 --> 47:15.000
That's where
I'm taking you.

47:15.834 --> 47:17.252
I'm opening a store.

47:18.962 --> 47:20.297
Computers.

47:21.340 --> 47:23.509
Everybody wants to have one.
We love them.

47:24.218 --> 47:26.136
Figured it made sense.

47:26.220 --> 47:27.471
You're gonna have
a computer store?

47:30.015 --> 47:31.099
Can I work there?

47:33.644 --> 47:35.646
Yeah, don't see
why not.

47:36.647 --> 47:38.982
In fact, I will
give you your first
assignment right now.

47:39.566 --> 47:42.611
I want you to
come up with a name.

47:45.447 --> 47:47.574
What? Stores need
a name, right?

47:48.992 --> 47:51.286
I can name it
whatever I want?

47:51.828 --> 47:52.829
All right, tell you what.

47:52.913 --> 47:54.748
When we pull up,

47:54.831 --> 47:57.000
the first thing that
comes into your mind.

47:58.460 --> 47:59.670
That'll be the name.

48:01.547 --> 48:02.839
Really?

48:07.010 --> 48:08.679
Now it's coming up
here on the right.

48:09.972 --> 48:12.015
Just keep those
eyes on the road.

48:21.692 --> 48:23.860
Now, I don't
have the keys yet,

48:23.944 --> 48:26.113
so we can't go in.

48:27.322 --> 48:29.616
I just closed on the place.
It's a bit of a fixer-upper,

48:29.700 --> 48:31.868
but it'll get there.

48:33.745 --> 48:34.788
It's awesome.

48:36.039 --> 48:38.041
I thought you'd like it.

48:41.878 --> 48:44.798
Hey, uh, back there,

48:44.881 --> 48:46.091
what we talked about,

48:47.342 --> 48:49.595
let's just keep
that between us, okay?

48:49.678 --> 48:53.599
Don't even tell your mom.
Just our little secret.

48:58.437 --> 48:59.855
Good.

48:59.938 --> 49:01.732
Now you have work to do.

49:02.858 --> 49:04.234
This place needs a name.

49:05.569 --> 49:07.070
Now, remember,

49:07.946 --> 49:10.073
the first thing that
pops into your mind.
