Andi:
 Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:05.330 --> 00:08.330
I want a real race to prove once
and for all who's the fastest.

00:08.330 --> 00:09.500
You get a real sparkle
in your eye

00:09.500 --> 00:10.380
when you're overconfident.

00:10.380 --> 00:12.040

00:12.040 --> 00:14.710
Marty: My sneakers!
Why are they wet?

00:14.710 --> 00:18.210
-You stole my shoe yesterday.
-I didn't take your shoe!

00:18.210 --> 00:20.620
Wanna skip to the part where
we're laughing about this?

00:20.620 --> 00:23.250
-I don't wanna be on the team.
-Stop!

00:23.250 --> 00:25.670
See, that's the thing. You think
I'll do whatever you want.

00:25.670 --> 00:28.580
I never stood up
for myself until today.

00:28.580 --> 00:31.620
-What? -Being around you
makes it really hard.

00:31.620 --> 00:34.580
What are you saying?
We're still friends.

00:34.580 --> 00:35.960
Were we ever?

00:53.830 --> 00:55.380
You're still in middle school?

00:55.380 --> 00:57.120
Uh, yeah.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.710
He's going to Grant next year.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.250
Think you'll try out
for baseball?

01:00.250 --> 01:02.710
Actually, I'm more
of an Ultimate Frisbee guy.

01:02.710 --> 01:05.420
(snickering)
What? That's not a real sport.

01:05.420 --> 01:06.330
It is, Kip.

01:06.330 --> 01:07.710
I'm the team captain.

01:07.710 --> 01:10.750
Ultimate Frisbee?
Dude, real sports don't need

01:10.750 --> 01:12.880
to try to make themselves
sound cool.

01:12.880 --> 01:17.040
I don't have to say Sweet Baseball
or Fantastic Football! Heh!

01:17.040 --> 01:19.170
What about
Off-the-Hook Hockey?

01:19.170 --> 01:20.540
Nice.

01:21.830 --> 01:24.380
Actually, Jonah's
super athletic.

01:24.380 --> 01:26.790
He'll def play a different sport
when he gets to high school.

Oh, nothin'.

Andi quit the team.

01:48.170 --> 01:49.960

slowly, and then all at once.

Tater Theater.

Love it.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.750
Proceed.

03:08.750 --> 03:11.960
Today's installment is
"The Fault in Our Taters."

03:11.960 --> 03:14.500
Hazel and Augustus
are star-crossed lovers

03:14.500 --> 03:15.290
who met at--

03:15.290 --> 03:17.330
But you're also
making me hungry.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.710
(high-pitched)
Augustus! Nooooo!

03:19.710 --> 03:20.710
(chuckles)

03:21.710 --> 03:23.790
And... scene.

03:31.580 --> 03:34.460
Are you waving to Jonah?

03:34.460 --> 03:36.380
He was looking over here.

03:36.380 --> 03:37.750
So?

03:37.750 --> 03:41.290
He looks-- I can't believe
I'm about to say this--

03:41.290 --> 03:42.580
forlorn?

03:42.580 --> 03:44.120
Don't care.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.000
How can you not care?

03:46.000 --> 03:49.170
A Jonah-free lifestyle
is way less complicated.

03:49.170 --> 03:51.420
But it was Amber who did
all those mean things.

03:51.420 --> 03:53.460
Jonah didn't do anything
that bad, did he?

03:53.460 --> 03:57.420
You've been here the whole time, Cyrus.
Whose side are you on?

03:57.420 --> 04:00.080
Yours. It's just...

04:01.250 --> 04:03.460
I liked
when we liked Jonah.

04:08.830 --> 04:09.830
Hey!

04:11.380 --> 04:13.460
Oh, well, look who it is.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.380
Buffy the Sneaker Slayer.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.250
I come bearing gifts.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.420
New sneakers.

04:18.420 --> 04:19.920
I'm a woman of my word.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.000
It's your deeds
I worry about.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.120
(sighs)

04:24.500 --> 04:27.960
If I open this box,
will I find sneakers

04:27.960 --> 04:30.380
or perhaps tarantulas?

04:30.380 --> 04:33.540
(laughs)
I knew I forgot something!

04:33.540 --> 04:36.040
The poisonous spiders.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.620
I'm gonna choose to trust you
and open this box.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.960
Savage!

04:43.960 --> 04:47.880
I just wanna make sure we're all good now.
We are, right?

04:47.880 --> 04:49.420
Just about.

04:49.420 --> 04:55.540
All you have to say is...
"Marty, I'm very, very..."

04:55.540 --> 04:57.040
Confused?

04:57.040 --> 04:58.460
"...sorry."

04:58.460 --> 04:59.830
You never apologized.

04:59.830 --> 05:03.540
Hey! I got you the best sneakers
two month's allowance can buy.

05:03.540 --> 05:06.250
I even upgraded your laces.

05:06.250 --> 05:09.250
You are seriously
apology-impaired.

05:09.250 --> 05:10.290
You might wanna
get that looked at.

05:10.290 --> 05:13.170
All right, all right!
I'm sorry.

05:13.170 --> 05:17.380
Points for technical merit... but,
I'm taking some away for execution.

05:17.380 --> 05:19.210
(sighs)

05:19.210 --> 05:23.420
So... we're actually
gonna do this race?

05:23.420 --> 05:25.580
Looks like it.

05:25.580 --> 05:26.620
Tomorrow after school?

05:26.620 --> 05:27.790
I'll be there.

05:27.790 --> 05:29.540
-I'll be first.
-I'm going there now.

05:29.540 --> 05:31.540
-I'm already there.
-I got there yesterday.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.250
Yeah, well, I--

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Actually, my mom's here.

05:48.670 --> 05:51.460
I'm gonna take off, okay?
I've got homework.

05:51.460 --> 05:54.120
Homework?
You're adorable.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.620
Wait a few.
We'll walk together.

05:55.620 --> 05:57.170
No, that's okay.

05:57.170 --> 05:58.710
You're havin' fun.

05:58.710 --> 06:00.420
I'll text you later, yeah?

06:08.330 --> 06:11.380
Jonah! Why did you rush out?
What's going on?

06:11.380 --> 06:13.460
I just wasn't havin'
a great time.

06:14.670 --> 06:17.080
I think you left
because of her.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.210
You wanna know
if she likes you.

06:19.210 --> 06:22.460
Sh-- She doesn't.
She made that very clear.

06:22.460 --> 06:24.710
There's one way
to know for sure.

06:24.710 --> 06:28.500
If she turns to look back at
you, it means she likes you.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.580
And not just as a friend.

06:29.580 --> 06:31.290
That's crazy, Amber.

06:31.290 --> 06:32.620
Is it?

06:32.620 --> 06:33.880
Totally.

06:40.580 --> 06:43.120
You like her, don't you?

06:43.120 --> 06:45.460
Like, like-her like her.

06:45.460 --> 06:47.040
No...

06:47.040 --> 06:50.880
that's just--
I gotta go.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.250
Jonah, wait!

07:14.500 --> 07:17.420
For snacks today, I was
learning toward baby carrots.

07:17.420 --> 07:19.420
But, I could also
shake things up

07:19.420 --> 07:22.330
and go with some sliced kiwi!

07:22.330 --> 07:25.880
C-- Cyrus... do you know
what's going on with Andi?

07:25.880 --> 07:29.420
She said she's not mad,
but... she still acts like it.

07:29.420 --> 07:33.040
I wouldn't call it mad,
more... coolly detached.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.330
Somehow, that sounds worse.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.540
What should I do?

07:36.540 --> 07:39.750
I'm sorry, you are
asking me for advice?

07:39.750 --> 07:41.330
Just allow me
to savor this moment

07:41.330 --> 07:42.330
of validation
for just one--

07:42.330 --> 07:43.620
Cyrus!

07:47.040 --> 07:48.670
Just go talk to her.

07:48.670 --> 07:53.210
I've never seen Andi stay mad-- I
mean, coolly detached, for long.

Yo! Go Space Otters!

08:30.880 --> 08:34.039
Hey, let's go to practice early so you can
do one of your Frisbee tricks for me!

08:34.039 --> 08:35.500

where you toss it backwards

08:35.500 --> 08:37.710

08:37.710 --> 08:39.620
I'm not in the mood
for Frisbee.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.919
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.830
Do me a favor. Tell the team
there's no practice today.

08:49.250 --> 08:51.330
I didn't think
this was possible.

08:53.460 --> 08:56.830
So listen... I just wanna
get this outta the way.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.330
I'm sorry
I invaded your privacy.

09:00.330 --> 09:03.960
And I'm sorry I overreacted
to your invasion.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.460
Is that why
you ignored my texts?

09:06.460 --> 09:08.500
I was giving you space.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.420
Well, it was
too much space.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.290
You know, there is
a happy medium

09:13.290 --> 09:18.290
between being all up in my stuff and
disappearing from the face of the Earth.

09:18.290 --> 09:20.500
I-- I guess I messed up!

09:20.500 --> 09:22.670
You know, I'm--
I'm new at this!

09:22.670 --> 09:24.500
Me, too.

09:24.500 --> 09:28.920
So... would you mind
if I stuck around

09:28.920 --> 09:31.920
and we could keep
messin' up together?

09:31.920 --> 09:33.670
Does that mean you're back?

09:33.670 --> 09:34.750
Is the tour over?

09:34.750 --> 09:36.710
No.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.420
Ask me why I'm here.

09:38.420 --> 09:39.880
Why are you here?

09:39.880 --> 09:41.920
Why do you ask?

09:41.920 --> 09:43.290
I'm just joshin' with you.

09:43.290 --> 09:44.620
(both laugh)

09:44.620 --> 09:47.580
I'm here-- dot, dot, dot--

09:47.580 --> 09:49.960
because the universe sent me.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.460
You got fired?

09:51.460 --> 09:55.330
No! Something... (mimics
explosion) cosmic happened.

09:55.330 --> 09:58.210
-What? -I was playing at
this club in Nashville,

09:58.210 --> 10:02.330
and this... was pinned up
on the wall.

10:02.330 --> 10:04.380
That's Bex!

10:04.380 --> 10:07.290
You found that
in a club in Nashville?

10:07.290 --> 10:08.380
That's crazy.

10:08.380 --> 10:11.420
I know. And you know
what's crazier?

10:11.420 --> 10:16.620
A few days later, I saw this...
at a club in Cleveland.

10:16.620 --> 10:18.460
No...

10:18.460 --> 10:20.420
That is the universe!

10:20.420 --> 10:22.040
No, that's just a coincidence.

10:23.210 --> 10:24.790
Dramatic pause.

10:27.380 --> 10:29.830
This... is the universe.

10:31.210 --> 10:34.500
Park City... Utah.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.460
Universe, get out!

10:36.460 --> 10:39.000
-(Bowie laughs)
-What does it mean?

10:39.000 --> 10:42.080
I don't know.
I came back to find out.

10:54.210 --> 10:56.540
Okay, let's do this.

10:56.540 --> 11:00.960
Probably only got 10 minutes left until
Coach Rez realizes his whistle's gone.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.080
You guys ready?

11:02.080 --> 11:03.500
-Ready.
-Let's go.

11:03.500 --> 11:06.170
Okay, runners,
take your marks.

11:09.420 --> 11:12.080
You guys must be psyched
to finally put an end to this.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.920
Yeah. Definitely.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.210
Aren't you?

11:15.210 --> 11:16.920
Totally.
So ready.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.330
Okay, cut the chatter.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.500
On your marks...

11:20.500 --> 11:21.290
One sec.

11:22.330 --> 11:24.750
Are you psyched
to finally end this?

11:24.750 --> 11:25.960
I thought you were.

11:25.960 --> 11:28.040
I thought I was, too.

11:28.040 --> 11:31.920
But, if we end this,
what happens to this?

11:31.920 --> 11:33.330
I don't know.

11:33.330 --> 11:35.120
We need to talk about this.

11:37.250 --> 11:39.330
Whistle standing down.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.540
Mist the purple orchid...

11:49.790 --> 11:52.580
with a delicate,
sweeping motion.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.830
Was that delicate enough?

11:57.830 --> 12:00.290
Oh, please don't die.

12:00.290 --> 12:01.750
(timer beeps)

12:01.750 --> 12:03.620
Dinner time!

12:10.170 --> 12:12.000
Guess what?

12:12.000 --> 12:15.330
We should've never agreed to plant sit
for Mom and Dad while they're away.

12:15.330 --> 12:19.330
I forget who I'm supposed to feed,
and it's not like I can ask them.

12:19.330 --> 12:22.210
Definitely this African violet.

12:22.210 --> 12:24.500
You can ask them.
Plants are very communicative.

12:27.290 --> 12:28.920
Are you hungry?

12:28.920 --> 12:30.830
Yeah, I thought so.

12:30.830 --> 12:33.080
Here. I'll do it.

12:39.330 --> 12:43.420
Aren't you the pretty girl? Mmm.

12:43.420 --> 12:44.960
(both chuckle)

12:44.960 --> 12:48.460
If we race...
and I beat you...

12:49.580 --> 12:51.460
will you still talk to me?

12:51.460 --> 12:54.500
If I beat you...
will you still talk to me?

12:56.250 --> 12:57.830
I'd like to say yes,

12:57.830 --> 13:01.040
but I think we both know I'm
not the most gracious loser.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.620
(laughs)
Me, neither.

13:04.670 --> 13:06.420
You know...

13:06.420 --> 13:07.330
Yeah?

13:07.330 --> 13:11.120
...if we didn't race,
we could still do this.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.120
Which we're both good at.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.830
Maybe one of us
is slightly better.

13:15.830 --> 13:17.380
(laughing)
Can't help yourself, can you?

13:17.380 --> 13:18.710
(laughing)
I can't!

13:20.120 --> 13:23.540
And... you're the only person
who gets that.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.420
Cyrus!

13:28.420 --> 13:30.290
What?
 The race is off!

13:30.290 --> 13:31.880
So I don't get
to blow the whistle?

13:31.880 --> 13:34.500
Go ahead, blow the whistle.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.250
I thought that would be
more exciting.

14:03.250 --> 14:06.330
Well, I still have the one
you gave me.

14:06.330 --> 14:07.670
Whaaat?

14:09.380 --> 14:12.540
She still has the candle
you gave her.

14:12.540 --> 14:13.880
Universe!

14:13.880 --> 14:16.580
(Bowie laughs) Nah. It's
just a really nice candle.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.000
I love indoor picnics.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.540
Yeah, me, too.

14:22.540 --> 14:24.830
Not that I've ever
had one before.

14:24.830 --> 14:27.960
CeCe would flip if she knew
we were doing this.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.210
Mom, don't eat
all the mac and cheese!

14:37.290 --> 14:39.210
So, she's callin' you mom now?

14:39.210 --> 14:42.080
Yeah, it's pretty new.
Comes and goes.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.460
It suits ya.

14:43.460 --> 14:45.540
What are you guys
whispering about?

14:45.540 --> 14:48.670
Oh, man...
we have a kid!

14:48.670 --> 14:51.420

14:52.500 --> 14:55.250
-Here we go!
-Thank you, Andi. Okay.

14:58.080 --> 15:02.330
I... want to hear the song
that you wrote for Bex.

15:03.420 --> 15:05.460
He doesn't remember it.

15:05.460 --> 15:07.960
Oh, yes, he does.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.670
He doesn't have his guitar.

15:09.670 --> 15:12.210
(chuckles)
Yes, he does.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.080
Why do I feel like
this is a bit of a setup?

15:16.080 --> 15:20.540
Oh. I think what you call
a setup is actually...

15:22.120 --> 15:23.210
a setup!

What happened?

18:29.460 --> 18:32.380
What happened?
What happened, what happened?

18:32.380 --> 18:36.420
-When? -Last night! The dancing,
the looking, the smiling!

18:36.420 --> 18:37.460
With Bowie?

18:37.460 --> 18:39.750
No, with the African violet.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.250
Yes, with Bowie!

18:41.250 --> 18:45.500
Andi, it was just two old
friends hangin' out...

18:45.500 --> 18:47.540
with their
no-longer-secret baby.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.080
It was more than that!

18:49.080 --> 18:50.380
I was there!

18:50.380 --> 18:52.460
It looked like you two
were getting back together.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.580
I know that's your fantasy,
you little cupid,

18:54.580 --> 18:56.420
but it's not gonna happen.

18:56.420 --> 19:00.380
Why not? You two clearly
still love each other.

19:00.380 --> 19:04.460
You're right.
I do love Bowie.

19:04.460 --> 19:05.920
I always will.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.500
I knew it!

19:07.500 --> 19:09.380
But we're not
getting back together.

19:10.790 --> 19:12.540
We'll never
get back together.

19:12.540 --> 19:15.170
What? Why not?

19:15.170 --> 19:17.670
Bowie's not someone
who puts down roots.

19:17.670 --> 19:19.040
You know that.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.210
But, maybe,
if you just try!

19:21.210 --> 19:24.040
Andi. This is how it is.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.880
Your dad's really fun
to be around,

19:27.880 --> 19:29.170
but he's unpredictable.

19:30.420 --> 19:33.670
He's not gonna be someone we'll
ever be able to count on.

19:36.460 --> 19:38.210
Okay, go on back to bed.

19:44.500 --> 19:45.290
Hey!

19:47.210 --> 19:49.460
Don't be mad at me.
Be mad at Kip.

19:49.460 --> 19:51.170
He was such a jerk
the other day.

19:52.460 --> 19:55.290
But, I should've
stuck up for you.

19:55.290 --> 19:57.290
Bad girlfriend alert!

19:58.380 --> 19:59.670
Are we okay, JoJo?

19:59.670 --> 20:02.620
No. W-- We're not okay, Amber.

20:02.620 --> 20:04.380
But I said I was sorry.

20:04.380 --> 20:06.540
It's not just what happened
with your friends.

20:06.540 --> 20:09.120
I know what this is about.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.250
Or should I say who?

20:10.250 --> 20:11.830
This isn't about Andi.

20:11.830 --> 20:13.420
Oh, please. She's been
trying to break us up

20:13.420 --> 20:15.580
ever since she joined
the Space Ferrets.

20:15.580 --> 20:18.120
Otters! It's Space Otters!

20:18.120 --> 20:21.330
Ferrets, Otters, the point is
Andi's manipulating you!

20:21.330 --> 20:23.330
No! I think you are, Amber!

20:23.330 --> 20:25.420
And I don't wanna
be your boyfriend anymore.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.290
Wait.

20:29.290 --> 20:32.750
You're... breaking up
with me?

20:34.250 --> 20:36.460
How dare you!

20:36.460 --> 20:39.420
You're in middle school, do you know
how lucky you are to be dating me?

20:39.420 --> 20:41.210
I'm gonna need that back.

20:44.170 --> 20:45.920
But you gave it to me.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.420
Actually, you took it.

20:51.420 --> 20:54.250
Huge mistake, Jonah Beck.

20:54.250 --> 20:56.380
You're gonna regret this.

21:08.710 --> 21:11.290
So, last night was fun, huh?

21:11.290 --> 21:12.380
Mm-hm.

21:14.250 --> 21:15.460
Is this about Bex?

21:16.670 --> 21:20.500
Yeah. Last night, when you
were singing that song

21:20.500 --> 21:25.460
and dancing with her, was that
the Bowie that left 13 years ago

21:25.460 --> 21:28.750
or was that the Bowie
that came back yesterday?

21:28.750 --> 21:33.670
I'm not gonna lie, Andi. My heart
never really got over Bex.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.830
But I-- I doubt
the feeling's mutual.

21:36.830 --> 21:38.420
But it is!

21:38.420 --> 21:42.040
She told me herself
that she loves you!

21:42.040 --> 21:44.040
She didn't use that word.

21:44.040 --> 21:45.500
Yes, she did.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.380
She most certainly did!

21:48.540 --> 21:51.080
And what else did she say?

21:51.080 --> 21:54.380
That she wasn't sure
if you were dependable.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.460
Well, she's got good reason
to think that.

21:58.710 --> 22:00.080
I haven't been.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.460
But, could you be now?

22:02.460 --> 22:06.210
I quit my tour
to be with you guys.

22:06.210 --> 22:07.210
You did?

22:08.330 --> 22:10.330
Why didn't you
tell her that?

22:10.330 --> 22:11.920
Because I didn't want
to freak her out...

22:13.170 --> 22:15.380
and make her think I was
putting any pressure on her.

22:15.380 --> 22:19.460
But she should know...
that you're dependable now.

22:19.460 --> 22:22.880
Well, maybe not
for the Renaissance Boys,

22:22.880 --> 22:25.710
but for the Mack girls.

22:25.710 --> 22:28.670
Well, you can't just tell
someone you're dependable.

22:28.670 --> 22:30.420
You've gotta show them.

22:30.420 --> 22:31.500
How?

22:31.500 --> 22:34.170
By stickin' around.

22:34.170 --> 22:38.710
That's gonna take so long.
Isn't there anything faster?

22:38.710 --> 22:42.040
If you've got any ideas,
I am all ears.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.920
I like this one.
What do you think?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.290
Looks good.

22:48.290 --> 22:49.540
How much is it?

22:55.460 --> 22:58.710
-A ring?
-You just found that?

22:58.710 --> 23:01.080
-Yeah.
-It's beautiful.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.540
I know.

23:03.710 --> 23:08.170
-It... looks like a--
-I was... gonna say that, too.

23:10.330 --> 23:11.880
Do you know what this means?

23:11.880 --> 23:14.330
Andi: You could ask
her to marry you!

23:14.330 --> 23:17.210
Bowie:
Do you think she wants that?

23:17.210 --> 23:18.960
Andi:
Well someone does.
