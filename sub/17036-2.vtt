00:05.100 --> 00:09.000
I'm-- I'm inside you.

00:09.100 --> 00:10.567
I know, yeah.

00:10.667 --> 00:14.000
[breathing heavily]

00:14.100 --> 00:18.000
It feels so good
making love to you.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.067
[moaning]

00:22.900 --> 00:25.400
Oh!

00:25.500 --> 00:26.300
[moaning]

00:27.300 --> 00:27.933
Ah!

00:28.033 --> 00:28.933
Meg.

00:29.033 --> 00:31.467
Open your eyes.

00:31.567 --> 00:32.933
Look at me.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.233
What do you want, Meg?

00:34.333 --> 00:36.033
Uh.

00:36.133 --> 00:37.767
Tell me what you want.

00:37.867 --> 00:40.533
This.

00:40.633 --> 00:41.600
Oh.

00:41.700 --> 00:42.633
Oh, yeah.

00:42.733 --> 00:44.433
Oh, that's better.

00:44.533 --> 00:45.633
Yeah.

00:45.733 --> 00:47.133
Ah, That's dark.

00:47.233 --> 01:01.100
[theme music playing]

01:01.200 --> 01:02.700
ANDREW: Bye, guys.
LAURA: Bye, Andrew.

01:02.800 --> 01:03.633
BUNNY: Bye, Andrew.

01:03.733 --> 01:06.800
See you, Puddle.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.500
Meg, he's the perfect man.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.533
Yes, yes, I know Bunny.

01:11.633 --> 01:13.500
He's very kind, isn't he?

01:13.600 --> 01:16.633
And generous, and
intelligent, and I've

01:16.733 --> 01:19.033
never been so bored in my life.

01:19.133 --> 01:20.800
Are you going to
break up with him then?

01:20.900 --> 01:21.867
Not to his face.

01:21.967 --> 01:23.267
No, no, I wouldn't
have thought so.

01:23.367 --> 01:25.667
No, I'm going full coward.

01:25.767 --> 01:26.933
I'm ghosting the
shit out of him.

01:27.033 --> 01:29.533
Oh, you can't just
start ignoring him.

01:29.633 --> 01:32.033
I'm not ignoring him,
I'm just ignoring his texts

01:32.133 --> 01:34.133
and his phone calls.
That's what ghosting is, mate.

01:34.233 --> 01:35.433
And what's the alternative?

01:35.533 --> 01:37.433
Look into his kind eyes
and tell him it's over?

01:37.533 --> 01:38.800
Risky.

01:38.900 --> 01:40.100
I've been ghosting Gary and he
still thinks we're together.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.333
Yeah, well, you
still live with him,

01:41.433 --> 01:42.700
and you had sex with
him this morning.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.033
Yeah but we didn't talk after.

01:44.133 --> 01:45.467
I know what's going on here.

01:45.567 --> 01:46.933
Do you want me to be
your break-up guru?

01:47.033 --> 01:48.433
No.

01:48.533 --> 01:50.067
You could try,
but Gary's knob's

01:50.167 --> 01:51.233
a serious addiction for me.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.633
You probably do
need to stop sleeping

01:52.733 --> 01:53.833
in the same bed at him, mate.

01:53.933 --> 01:55.767
Where am I gonna sleep?

01:55.867 --> 01:57.667
Stay here.

01:57.767 --> 01:58.600
You can move in with us.

01:58.700 --> 01:59.533
Not what I meant.

01:59.633 --> 02:00.500
Are you sure?

02:00.600 --> 02:02.567
Oh, yes, please.

02:02.667 --> 02:05.200
All of us single together
for the first time,

02:05.300 --> 02:06.733
and I can be your shrink.

02:06.833 --> 02:10.700
Oh please, please, I'm so bored
and I really need a project.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.033
Said no shrink ever.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.167
[music playing]

02:16.333 --> 02:18.533
We might need to do two trips.

02:18.633 --> 02:20.200
Ugh.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.667
LAURA: Right, let's
get this baby set up.

02:22.767 --> 02:25.200
Do you know what the great
thing about living with me is?

02:25.300 --> 02:26.633
You'll never have
to buy Coca-Cola

02:26.733 --> 02:28.167
again, 'cause I make it myself.

02:28.267 --> 02:31.267
Oh wow, that'll
save us pennies.

02:31.367 --> 02:32.767
Gary used to get mad
about all this stuff,

02:32.867 --> 02:35.500
but the thing about me is I
know a bargain when I see one.

02:35.600 --> 02:36.800
Right.

02:36.900 --> 02:39.400
Did somebody rob Sue Ryder?

02:39.500 --> 02:42.800
Laura's moved all of her stuff
in temporarily while she lives

02:42.900 --> 02:45.600
here, very much temporarily.

02:45.700 --> 02:48.267
We'll have to go back for
those kayaks another day.

02:48.367 --> 02:51.733
Anyway, I've got an antidote
to your new-found singledom.

02:51.833 --> 02:55.100
Chloe from my acting class is
having a house party tonight.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.100
So a room full of gay lads.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.100
That is fine by me.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.167
I just want to forget
about men for a while.

03:01.267 --> 03:02.933
Dick detox, good call.

03:03.033 --> 03:04.167
Is that why you
changed your profile

03:04.267 --> 03:05.533
pic to you sucking on a banana?

03:05.633 --> 03:06.433
[scoffs]

03:06.533 --> 03:07.400
That's just gags.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.367
Just classic Meg.

03:09.467 --> 03:10.967
Laura-Cola and voddy anyone?

03:11.067 --> 03:11.867
Voddy?

03:11.967 --> 03:13.200
It's four o'clock.

03:13.300 --> 03:14.600
Oh, we should
start getting ready.

03:14.700 --> 03:15.767
Yeah, it's four o'clock.

03:15.867 --> 03:18.100
I better start on my nails.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.700
[music playing]

03:20.800 --> 03:21.600
[gagging]

03:36.800 --> 03:37.633
To ghosting.

03:41.800 --> 03:42.933
Whoa, Meg.

03:43.033 --> 03:44.300
Don't shit yourself,
but uh, six o'clock.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.433
No, sorry, not six
o'clock, 12 o'clock.

03:46.533 --> 03:47.800
No, my 12 o'clock.

03:47.900 --> 03:48.733
Keswick.

03:48.833 --> 03:49.733
Oh no.

03:49.833 --> 03:50.633
On your own again?

03:50.733 --> 03:51.933
You look well, Kes.

03:52.033 --> 03:53.333
Clothes are a bit weird, but--

03:53.433 --> 03:55.333
Yeah well, you're just a--

03:55.433 --> 03:56.067
Here it comes.

03:56.167 --> 04:01.667
Sad case lowlife.

04:01.767 --> 04:02.900
Ouch.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.533
Oh, Skinner's here.

04:04.633 --> 04:07.233
Do you want out?

04:07.333 --> 04:08.333
"Sad case lowlife?"

04:08.433 --> 04:10.533
Yeah, I know,
sorry, but he puts

04:10.633 --> 04:13.667
me on edge 'cause he's
just so mean and fit.

04:13.767 --> 04:14.933
Mmm.

04:15.033 --> 04:16.000
Hot and cold Meg.

04:16.100 --> 04:17.467
Do not go back there.

04:17.567 --> 04:20.600
Yeah, I know, but I really
do want to go back there.

04:20.700 --> 04:21.867
Ooh, hubba.

04:21.967 --> 04:24.300
Plenty of other fit
men around here, Meg.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.167
Look at him, he's gorgeous.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.767
Oh for fuck's sake,
what's Gary doing here?

04:29.867 --> 04:33.100
Oopsy, send-all fail.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.267
Hey, babe.

04:34.367 --> 04:35.833
Right, one of us
has got to leave,

04:35.933 --> 04:37.100
and it ain't going to be me.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.733
Laura, please, can
we just skip this bit?

04:38.833 --> 04:39.967
It's getting tedious.

04:40.067 --> 04:40.933
Tedious?

04:41.033 --> 04:42.567
Have you been reading again?

04:42.667 --> 04:43.733
Gary, I'm not bluffing.

04:43.833 --> 04:44.767
It's over, I've moved out.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.567
We had sex this morning.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.200
Oh are you stupid, Gary?

04:48.300 --> 04:49.267
That didn't count.

04:49.367 --> 04:50.033
Why not?

04:50.133 --> 04:52.367
I were facing the wall.

04:52.467 --> 04:55.933
Let me know when you
want to get a cab home.

04:56.033 --> 05:02.867
[music playing]

05:02.967 --> 05:05.000
Oh, your tits look bigger, Kes.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.833
I'm on a new pill.

05:06.933 --> 05:07.833
I know the feeling.

05:07.933 --> 05:08.800
What?

05:08.900 --> 05:10.567
Fuck me, these are strong.

05:10.667 --> 05:11.467
What are?

05:11.567 --> 05:12.633
Kes, I need a hug.

05:12.733 --> 05:13.567
OK.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.567
Oh, that's better.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.000
I've missed you, Kes.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.900
Oh yeah, fuck I've
really missed you.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.867
Hadn't realized it 'til now.

05:21.967 --> 05:24.833
Can you stroke my head?

05:24.933 --> 05:27.600
Ah, how good does that feel?

05:27.700 --> 05:29.100
Can I kiss you, Kes?

05:29.200 --> 05:31.133
I think it would
feel really good.

05:41.867 --> 05:44.767
Want to go somewhere private?

05:44.867 --> 05:46.267
I strongly advise
against this, Meg.

05:46.367 --> 05:48.700
Yeah well, if you need me,
I'll be getting my freak on.

05:52.233 --> 05:53.800
She'll regret
that in the morning.

05:53.900 --> 05:55.200
Shame, I love Andrew.

05:55.300 --> 05:56.767
That's ghosting for
you though, isn't it?

05:56.867 --> 05:59.100
Looks a bit shady when you
see someone else at it.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.767
If you're going to
break up with someone,

06:00.867 --> 06:02.333
you do need to let them know.

06:02.433 --> 06:04.333
You have to be very
clear, or how else

06:04.433 --> 06:05.633
will they know that it's over.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.333
Babe, I meant to say my
mom wants us to go over

06:07.433 --> 06:08.733
for lunch tomorrow about one.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.467
We're not together
you fucktard.

06:13.933 --> 06:16.400
Uh, that's my fucking
boyfriend, Fish.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.900
I'm sorry, she just pounced.

06:18.000 --> 06:18.900
She did, I saw it.

06:19.000 --> 06:19.833
Who are you?

06:19.933 --> 06:20.900
I'm her boyfriend.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.067
Ex-boyfriend.

06:22.167 --> 06:23.033
Thought you were
over girls, Aaron.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.000
She just pounced on me.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.067
You're a fucking shit.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.267
Calm down, don't
worry about it.

06:26.367 --> 06:27.767
Don't tell me to
calm down when I

06:27.867 --> 06:28.967
see you snogging someone else.
- I didn't know, honestly.

06:29.067 --> 06:29.900
You need to back up.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Darling, we need to go.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.467
Laura's started a
bit of a squabble.

06:34.567 --> 06:35.833
Kes, call me, yeah?

06:35.933 --> 06:37.433
I deleted your number?

06:37.533 --> 06:38.233
Why?

06:38.333 --> 06:39.900
Because you gave me an STD.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.267
Oh yeah.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.767
MAN: What's everyone staring at?
Fuck off.

06:42.867 --> 06:43.967
I'm coming for you next, Fish.

06:44.067 --> 06:45.100
Leg it!

06:45.200 --> 06:47.567
MAN: Where the
fuck are you going?

06:47.667 --> 06:49.967
See you at home, babe.

06:50.067 --> 06:55.467
[phone buzzing]

06:55.567 --> 06:56.467
Oh, shit.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.300
ANDREW: (ON PHONE)
Hey Puddle, it's me.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.867
Just wondering how
things are going.

07:06.967 --> 07:07.800
[laughing]

07:09.167 --> 07:12.567
So Andrew's
immune to ghosting.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.433
Then you're a filthy cheat.

07:14.533 --> 07:19.033
Hot and Cold keeps sending me
pictures of his lovely penis.

07:19.133 --> 07:20.167
[phone ringing]

07:21.267 --> 07:22.967
Oh!

07:23.067 --> 07:24.167
You have to tell
him the truth.

07:24.267 --> 07:25.400
No, not the truth.

07:28.167 --> 07:29.767
Hi Andrew.

07:29.867 --> 07:32.433
Yeah, crazy night.

07:32.533 --> 07:36.167
I lost my phone.

07:36.267 --> 07:42.600
And well yeah, I found
it in my cagoule.

07:42.700 --> 07:45.567
I know, yeah.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.900
Tonight?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.300
That would be perfect.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.767
OK, I'll text you a place.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.800
OK, don't judge me.

07:56.900 --> 07:58.933
We're meeting up
later for a drink,

07:59.033 --> 08:02.367
and I'm going to tell him to his
face that it's definitely over.

08:02.467 --> 08:04.000
And confess to the cheating.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.700
Let's just see how it goes.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.100
I've never dumped
anyone before.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.200
Where do you do it?

08:08.300 --> 08:09.900
Well, meet him
at my dumping pub.

08:10.000 --> 08:10.967
You have a dumping pub?

08:11.067 --> 08:11.900
Mmm.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.167
The Cock Tavern.

08:13.267 --> 08:15.100
It's a one-drink-and-vacate
kind of place,

08:15.200 --> 08:17.000
usually empty, save
for some terrifying,

08:17.100 --> 08:18.000
toothless crackheads.

08:18.100 --> 08:19.500
That does sound ideal.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.233
Poor Andrew.

08:21.333 --> 08:22.733
He deserves better.

08:22.833 --> 08:25.767
Stop sticking up for Andrew,
I'm doing the right thing.

08:25.867 --> 08:26.867
Just so you can
have guilt-free

08:26.967 --> 08:28.200
sex with Hot and Cold again.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.800
I can read you like a blog, Meg.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.467
OM Jesus!

08:33.567 --> 08:35.400
Oh.

08:35.500 --> 08:36.833
Laura?

08:36.933 --> 08:37.933
Oh, sorry about that.

08:38.033 --> 08:41.333
A fair bit of regrowth.

08:41.433 --> 08:42.833
I did not agree to this.

08:42.933 --> 08:45.367
She has to go, and you have
to be the one to tell her.

08:45.467 --> 08:47.333
Fine, although I think
you're overreacting.

08:47.433 --> 08:48.933
Their just pubes, Meg,
we've all got them.

08:49.033 --> 08:50.267
Well, actually, she
doesn't anymore.

08:50.367 --> 08:51.833
They're all in this bowl.

08:51.933 --> 08:59.067
[music playing]

08:59.167 --> 09:04.533
[text sound]

09:04.633 --> 09:06.567
Oh, a fucking restaurant.

09:06.667 --> 09:07.933
ANDREW: I hope you
don't mind, I took

09:08.033 --> 09:09.500
the liberty of booking a table.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.200
I've always wanted
to try this place,

09:11.300 --> 09:13.633
I've just been waiting for the
right person to try it with.

09:13.733 --> 09:15.800
Yeah, we need to talk.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.500
Mr. Campbell,
your table is ready.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.400
Please?

09:22.167 --> 09:23.100
Why not.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.200
Follow me.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.867
There's only one decision
to make with the menu, 10

09:29.967 --> 09:30.833
or 15 courses?

09:30.933 --> 09:31.900
Uh, 15.

09:32.000 --> 09:32.800
15?

09:39.200 --> 09:41.567
Wonder what he's doing now.

09:41.667 --> 09:42.800
Laura, can we talk?

09:42.900 --> 09:46.033
Probably staying in and
ordering a currizza for one.

09:46.133 --> 09:48.033
What if he gets horny
and I'm not there?

09:48.133 --> 09:49.667
Well, he'll just toss
himself off, darling.

09:49.767 --> 09:52.000
What if he does that thing
where he accidentally kills

09:52.100 --> 09:54.100
himself while he's wanking?

09:54.200 --> 09:56.067
Listen, Laura, Meg
and I have been talking,

09:56.167 --> 09:57.767
and we would like you to--

09:57.867 --> 09:59.133
I feel a bit funny.

09:59.233 --> 10:01.933
We need you to, Laura--
and I'm sorry about this--

10:02.033 --> 10:03.667
Something
happening to my eyes.

10:03.767 --> 10:07.667
Oh, shit, Bunny, is this crying?

10:07.767 --> 10:09.433
Am I crying?

10:09.533 --> 10:10.900
Um.

10:11.000 --> 10:11.800
[crying]

10:14.433 --> 10:16.133
Yes.

10:16.233 --> 10:18.667
My eyes are all wet.

10:18.767 --> 10:20.067
What's happening?

10:20.167 --> 10:22.433
Is this normal?

10:22.533 --> 10:23.367
[sobbing]

10:27.433 --> 10:31.100
Oh, um, I bought
you a present.

10:31.200 --> 10:40.100
Oh This is a self-help book.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.133
Yeah, I thought you'd like it.

10:43.233 --> 10:47.067
OK, so Andrew,
there was something

10:47.167 --> 10:50.433
that I needed to tell you.

10:50.533 --> 10:53.767
Pollen-dusted grass-fed
lamb with nettle foam.

10:53.867 --> 10:55.767
Well, that looks sensational.

10:55.867 --> 10:57.333
Cheers.

10:57.433 --> 11:02.767
So we've been on a
few dates now, Andrew.

11:02.867 --> 11:05.800
And, well, the thing is--

11:05.900 --> 11:07.233
[mumbling]

11:07.333 --> 11:12.100
Oh sh-- shoes, that is sublime.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.133
Oh my God, what the--

11:14.233 --> 11:16.067
what is happening,
there's so many tastes.

11:16.167 --> 11:17.367
Is that good, Puddle?

11:17.467 --> 11:18.433
Good?

11:18.533 --> 11:19.700
I don't think I've
ever been this happy.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.233
You glad we came?

11:21.333 --> 11:23.033
I'm in heaven, I'm
so fucking happy.

11:23.133 --> 11:24.500
That is amazing.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.400
That is exquis,
absolutely exquis.

11:27.500 --> 11:30.033
It's really
special for me, too.

11:30.133 --> 11:31.700
Mmm, oh God.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.167
I think I'm in love.

11:33.267 --> 11:35.233
With the food or with me?

11:35.333 --> 11:36.867
What?

11:36.967 --> 11:39.600
Fuck it, Meg.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.533
I'm in love with you.

11:43.900 --> 11:46.700
C-- cool.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.800
I'm inside you.

11:48.900 --> 11:49.733
[moaning]

11:49.833 --> 11:51.633
Can we use the pillow?

11:51.733 --> 11:52.567
Uh-uh.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.467
[moaning]

11:54.567 --> 11:57.167
I want you to see me.

11:57.267 --> 11:59.067
I want to see you.

11:59.167 --> 12:01.233
Sorry, can we-- can we stop?

12:01.333 --> 12:04.433
Just-- just really full.

12:04.533 --> 12:05.833
OK, Puddle.

12:05.933 --> 12:06.733
Yeah.

12:06.833 --> 12:08.433
Um.

12:08.533 --> 12:09.967
Um, OK.

12:10.067 --> 12:13.000
That's-- let's just spoon.

12:15.733 --> 12:16.533
I love you, Meg.

12:20.567 --> 12:22.833
I love you.

12:22.933 --> 12:24.133
Do you love me?

12:26.767 --> 12:30.067
[pretending to snore]

12:35.900 --> 12:36.767
[music playing]

12:42.733 --> 12:44.067
Morning.

12:44.167 --> 12:45.667
How did the dumping go, Meg?

12:45.767 --> 12:46.767
Didn't dump him.

12:46.867 --> 12:47.767
Had sex with him.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.400
Oh, for God's sake.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.967
I thought you hated
having sex with Andrew.

12:51.067 --> 12:55.100
Not hate, just,
eh, makes me cringe.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.600
It was complicated.

12:56.700 --> 13:00.133
I was going to dump him, but
we had a wonderful night.

13:00.233 --> 13:05.833
That was dinner, 15 courses,
good chat, bought me a book,

13:05.933 --> 13:06.733
told me he loved me.

13:06.833 --> 13:07.667
Oh boy.

13:07.767 --> 13:08.800
Unlucky.

13:08.900 --> 13:09.800
Why?

13:09.900 --> 13:11.200
'Cause you don't love him.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.200
Yeah, but give it time.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.167
I think it's kind of flattering.

13:15.267 --> 13:17.300
More than can be said
for Hot and Cold,

13:17.400 --> 13:19.600
who communicates solely by
the medium of dick pics.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.700
So you're going to try
and fall in love with Andrew

13:21.800 --> 13:23.533
to avoid dumping him?

13:23.633 --> 13:24.667
I really like the guy.

13:24.767 --> 13:26.933
Are you sure you don't
just really like dinner?

13:27.033 --> 13:28.467
I wouldn't go in
the bog for a bit.

13:28.567 --> 13:31.933
Budge up, babe.

13:32.033 --> 13:34.467
Oh, Gaz kind of stopped
over here last night.

13:34.567 --> 13:35.700
Certainly did.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.000
Got a booty call from
little Lozza-chops didn't I?

13:38.100 --> 13:41.167
Cheers for letting us
have your bed, Meg.

13:41.267 --> 13:43.600
We'll change your sheets.

13:43.700 --> 13:44.600
Come on.

13:48.667 --> 13:51.133
Why is she still here?

13:51.233 --> 13:52.400
I couldn't do it.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.933
She started crying,
it was really boring,

13:55.033 --> 13:56.200
and then I fell asleep.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.133
Well, what happened
to sticking to the plan?

13:58.233 --> 13:59.900
I could ask you
the same question.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.833
Well good break-up
guruing, Bunny.

14:01.933 --> 14:03.633
It's OK, I'll sort
it out, I promise.

14:03.733 --> 14:05.033
[text message buzzing]

14:05.133 --> 14:08.500
Well, that's his penis again.

14:08.600 --> 14:13.400
Right, I have to go and
put a stop to all this.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.967
I wouldn't be in
too much of a hurry.

14:15.067 --> 14:16.033
Cor.

14:18.967 --> 14:20.933
I though that might
have tempted you, Kes.

14:21.033 --> 14:22.900
Look, I just came
round to say I've got---

14:23.000 --> 14:23.800
[sighs]

14:28.267 --> 14:30.167
Can you put some clothes
on, we need to talk.

14:30.267 --> 14:32.967
We'll talk after.

14:33.067 --> 14:35.000
Look, the other
night was a mistake,

14:35.100 --> 14:36.400
I've actually still
got a boyfriend.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.200
What's a young,
hot, independent woman

14:38.300 --> 14:40.667
like you doing tied down
in a stifling relationship?

14:40.767 --> 14:42.833
You should be sowing your
wild oats, having fun.

14:42.933 --> 14:44.500
I am having fun.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.633
He took out for dinner last
night, it was 15 courses.

14:46.733 --> 14:49.167
Pfft, I just think
it's a shame blokes

14:49.267 --> 14:50.967
feel the need to
control women by forcing

14:51.067 --> 14:52.467
relationships on them.

14:52.567 --> 14:54.133
Everyone should be free to
sleep with whoever they want,

14:54.233 --> 14:55.267
whenever they want.

14:55.367 --> 14:57.133
Women have needs, too.

14:57.233 --> 15:01.233
If he don't understand that,
then he's just a sexist.

15:01.333 --> 15:04.467
And he's an idiot, 'cause
he's going to lose you.

15:04.567 --> 15:07.800
I suppose I was
feeling a bit stifled.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.233
Come here, Kes.

15:09.333 --> 15:11.500
It doesn't mean you have
to break up with this guy.

15:11.600 --> 15:12.600
Don't I?

15:12.700 --> 15:13.900
Of course not.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.100
You just need to explain
to him your new rules.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.167
See, we've all been
brainwashed into thinking

15:19.267 --> 15:21.600
that it's all or nothing.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.500
In fact, there's a third way.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.567
A third way?

15:24.667 --> 15:26.900
Where you're not
tied down by labels,

15:27.000 --> 15:28.567
you can sleep with
whoever you want.

15:28.667 --> 15:29.933
Doesn't that sound good?

15:30.033 --> 15:32.100
I suppose so.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.533
Why don't you lie
down for a bit, Kes.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.800
Just have a little cuddle.

15:34.900 --> 15:38.867
OK, Just for a bit.

15:38.967 --> 15:40.433
[music playing]

15:54.367 --> 15:55.933
Why are we meeting
in the dumping pub?

15:56.033 --> 15:58.333
Laura's dumping Gary,
once and for all, and I

15:58.433 --> 16:00.067
am here as her break-up mentor.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.233
And when she's
finished, we're going

16:01.333 --> 16:02.800
to dump her as a flatmate.

16:02.900 --> 16:03.933
Solid plan.

16:04.033 --> 16:05.500
Except you'll
have to go it alone,

16:05.600 --> 16:07.233
because I'm meeting Andrew to
tell him about the third way.

16:07.333 --> 16:08.467
The third way? way?

16:08.567 --> 16:09.700
Yeah, don't have
to break up with him.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.633
We've all been brainwashed.

16:11.733 --> 16:14.833
Yeah, it's my rules, and I
won't be tied down by labels.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.967
I can sleep with whoever I want.

16:17.067 --> 16:18.233
Did Hot and Cold
tell you this?

16:18.333 --> 16:19.400
Yeah.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.667
Meg, just put poor
Andrew out of his misery.

16:20.767 --> 16:21.900
Don't need to.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.400
Just gonna tell him
about the third way.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.033
I absolutely cannot end up
having dinner with him again.

16:26.133 --> 16:27.267
Just tell him
to meet you here.

16:27.367 --> 16:28.633
It's a shithole, there's
no way he'll tell

16:28.733 --> 16:29.933
you he loves you again in here.

16:30.033 --> 16:31.533
Good point.

16:31.633 --> 16:34.500
But he's quite
scared of this place

16:34.600 --> 16:37.967
so I'm going to have
to be very persuasive.

16:38.067 --> 16:39.333
Tit pic.

16:39.433 --> 16:40.267
Tit pic.

16:43.267 --> 16:47.567
So, I've been thinking,
and relationships, eh?

16:47.667 --> 16:49.433
Why does it have to
be all or nothing?

16:49.533 --> 16:52.067
We've all been
brainwashed, Andrew.

16:52.167 --> 16:56.133
There's a third way, after all.

16:56.233 --> 16:58.800
I'm not sure I follow.

16:58.900 --> 17:03.233
Well, you know, I'm a
young, hot, independent woman.

17:03.333 --> 17:07.767
You know, I've got
needs, you've got needs.

17:07.867 --> 17:09.033
You're just being a bit sexist.

17:11.967 --> 17:12.767
What?

17:15.567 --> 17:17.800
But I thought we were
getting back together.

17:17.900 --> 17:20.667
Why do you keep sleeping with
me if you're not in love with me

17:20.767 --> 17:23.067
anymore?

17:23.167 --> 17:25.633
Boredom.

17:25.733 --> 17:29.733
Look, it's my rules, and I
won't be tied down by labels.

17:29.833 --> 17:31.100
Are you dumping me?

17:31.200 --> 17:33.800
Because I love you, Meg.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.700
No, it's just--

17:35.800 --> 17:38.333
look, it's the third way, OK?

17:38.433 --> 17:47.800
It's about having the freedom
to sleep with whoever I want.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.033
So you're cheating on me?

17:49.133 --> 17:53.100
No, no, it's--

17:53.200 --> 17:55.533
it's the third way.

17:55.633 --> 17:58.867
Right, because it sounds
like you've cheated on me,

17:58.967 --> 18:00.700
and you want to
continue cheating on me,

18:00.800 --> 18:02.000
with my permission.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.567
Would that be
something you were into?

18:06.667 --> 18:08.333
Obviously not, definit--

18:08.433 --> 18:09.867
no!

18:09.967 --> 18:11.067
So you've brought
me to this shithole

18:11.167 --> 18:12.600
because you're dumping me.

18:12.700 --> 18:15.467
No, look, the reason we're
in the dumping pub is not bec--

18:15.567 --> 18:16.900
You call this place
the dumping pub?

18:17.000 --> 18:17.800
Hmm?

18:17.900 --> 18:19.467
You have a dumping pub?

18:21.800 --> 18:22.600
Pff.

18:27.133 --> 18:28.800
How are you feeling, Laura?

18:30.100 --> 18:33.300
Yeah fine, relieved.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.267
I mean, I do feel a bit guilty.

18:36.367 --> 18:37.600
[crying]

18:39.000 --> 18:40.900
Sound advice, Bun,
you're a top mate.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.500
And cheers for
telling me to move in.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.367
Smart move, that.

18:43.467 --> 18:45.600
Yeah, um, Laura, about that.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.100
Meg wanted me to tell
you that she doesn't

18:47.200 --> 18:48.233
want you to move in with us.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.000
So where am I gonna live?

18:50.100 --> 18:51.367
Yeah that's a good point.

18:51.467 --> 18:53.533
Well you could have told
me before I dumped Gary.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.433
[crying]

18:56.733 --> 18:59.600
Yeah that would have
been a better way around.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.700
I'll fix this.

19:01.800 --> 19:05.200
You've tried to meet me here
at the dumping pub before.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.200
You don't really like me at
all, do you, you just like being

19:07.300 --> 19:08.733
taken out for dinner.

19:08.833 --> 19:11.767
You didn't really leave your
phone in the cagoule, did you?

19:11.867 --> 19:13.933
You were sleeping with
someone else, weren't you?

19:14.033 --> 19:15.667
And now you're dumping me.

19:15.767 --> 19:16.800
No!

19:16.900 --> 19:19.600
Look, it's the third
fucking way, OK?

19:19.700 --> 19:22.867
This is not a dumping, I
cannot stress that enough.

19:22.967 --> 19:25.633
We are here because
Laura's dumping Gary,

19:25.733 --> 19:29.500
and then Bunny and I are
dumping Laura as a flatmate.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.800
Can you hear yourself?

19:31.900 --> 19:32.700
Yes.

19:42.133 --> 19:43.433
I'm confused.

19:43.533 --> 19:46.000
So I'm dumped but you
still want to live with me.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.767
Yeah the arrangement
is, we live together,

19:47.867 --> 19:49.233
but we sleep with
whoever we like.

19:49.333 --> 19:50.700
It's called the third way.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.133
Well that sounds fine
for you, you're a hot bird.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.000
What about me, I can't
pull for shit, can I?

19:55.100 --> 19:56.167
Eh, fair point.

19:56.267 --> 19:57.700
I'll have to stay
with you and Meg.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.200
Now let's not be
too hasty, Gary.

19:59.300 --> 20:01.000
When was the last time
that you tried to pull?

20:01.100 --> 20:02.067
Can't remember.

20:02.167 --> 20:03.600
OK, so you're a little rusty.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.067
That's fine, we can help you.

20:05.167 --> 20:06.067
This is messed up.

20:06.167 --> 20:07.367
You've got to loosen up, Gary.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.567
This is the modern dating scene.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.900
People do the third
way all the time.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.367
Meg is doing it with
Andrew right now.

20:12.467 --> 20:13.767
ANDREW: Well, I'm
going to leave, then.

20:13.867 --> 20:15.033
It's the third way.
ANDREW: You're going to stop me.

20:15.133 --> 20:16.200
MEG: No, I'm not
going to stop you.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.333
ANDREW: OK, well
that's annoying, but--

20:17.433 --> 20:18.567
No one's going
to want me, though.

20:18.667 --> 20:19.467
True.

20:19.567 --> 20:21.067
Gary, you're a catch.

20:21.167 --> 20:23.033
You've got so much
going for you.

20:23.133 --> 20:24.200
You're a businessman.

20:24.300 --> 20:26.233
Kind of, carpet fitter.

20:26.333 --> 20:28.400
And you're kind,
and good looking.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.333
Am I?

20:29.433 --> 20:30.300
Cheers.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.133
Gorgeous blue
eyes, great height,

20:32.233 --> 20:35.433
so muscular, lovely
smile, always thought so.

20:35.533 --> 20:36.300
All right, Bunny.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.200
You're not so bad yourself.

20:38.300 --> 20:41.100
Always liked your
face, and tits.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.667
And you don't strike me
as a man who has anything

20:43.767 --> 20:44.800
to worry about downstairs.

20:44.900 --> 20:46.567
Wilbur is about average.

20:46.667 --> 20:50.167
And Laura tells me that
you're a very good kisser.

20:50.267 --> 20:51.900
I feel like I'm being hit on.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.833
Yeah, it does seem
a bit like that.

20:53.933 --> 20:55.033
And how does
that make you feel?

20:55.133 --> 20:58.467
Good, nice, confident.

20:58.567 --> 20:59.800
See?

20:59.900 --> 21:01.467
This could be the perfect
arrangement for to both of you.

21:01.567 --> 21:04.700
Imagine, you get to
kiss whoever you like.

21:04.800 --> 21:13.867
No labels, no boundaries, no
rules, you can just go for it.

21:13.967 --> 21:16.333
Mm!

21:16.433 --> 21:17.667
What the fuck?

21:17.767 --> 21:19.267
Oh, you are a good kisser.

21:19.367 --> 21:20.733
I want to do a third way.

21:20.833 --> 21:22.500
What is wrong with you people?

21:22.600 --> 21:24.633
Sozzers, Laura, it
was too far, my bad.

21:24.733 --> 21:27.000
But by way of demonstration,
that went well, I thought.

21:27.100 --> 21:28.533
- We're not doing the third way.
- Oh, what?

21:28.633 --> 21:29.700
We're not doing it.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.000
Ain't gonna work.

21:31.100 --> 21:32.733
Are you just jealous,
or do you still love me?

21:32.833 --> 21:33.767
Gary, it's the same thing.

21:36.833 --> 21:38.900
I did that.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.433
Oh, and Meg--

21:41.533 --> 21:44.900
you don't realize it now, but
me and you have something,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.900
we've got something
special, and unique.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.467
And I was going to support you.

21:49.567 --> 21:53.367
No matter what, I was going to
watch you grow, and love you.

21:53.467 --> 21:55.933
I was going to give you my love.

21:56.033 --> 21:57.733
And one day, you'll
want someone's love,

21:57.833 --> 21:59.200
and you'll understand.

21:59.300 --> 22:01.600
And maybe it will
be mine, maybe not,

22:01.700 --> 22:08.867
but I hope you remember
it was offered sincerely,

22:08.967 --> 22:13.267
and generously, and
unconditionally.

22:16.133 --> 22:19.533
Bye, Meg.

22:19.633 --> 22:20.533
[sighs]

22:24.367 --> 22:25.767
- Bit boring, though.
- Yeah.

22:25.867 --> 22:26.733
So boring.

22:26.833 --> 22:27.833
Right, yeah.

22:27.933 --> 22:29.733
Right, should
we head off, then.

22:29.833 --> 22:31.067
Yeah, let's go.

22:31.167 --> 22:33.200
The Cola's disgusting in here.

22:33.300 --> 22:35.767
Well, my work here is done.

22:35.867 --> 22:36.933
You've done nothing.

22:37.033 --> 22:38.300
They're in exactly
the same situation

22:38.400 --> 22:39.700
as they were before,
except you've

22:39.800 --> 22:41.533
now kissed her boyfriend.

22:41.633 --> 22:43.900
Still, at least we have
our flat to ourselves again.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.433
Yeah, you do.

22:45.533 --> 22:48.133
I'm going on a guilt-free sex
marathon with Hot and Cold.

22:48.233 --> 22:49.200
Don't wait up.

22:54.533 --> 22:56.067
Good news.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.333
Je suis single.

22:57.433 --> 22:59.167
Uh yeah, now's not
really a very good time.

22:59.267 --> 23:00.767
WOMAN: Who is it?

23:00.867 --> 23:02.633
Uh, it's just a
Jehovah's Witness.

23:02.733 --> 23:04.267
WOMAN: Oh, fuck off!

23:04.367 --> 23:07.467
Uh, but you said
about the third way.

23:07.567 --> 23:09.433
OK, bye.

23:09.533 --> 23:12.433
[music playing]

23:12.533 --> 23:14.300
[sighing]
