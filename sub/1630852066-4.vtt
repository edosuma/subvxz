00:09.718 --> 00:12.888
Mic check, one, two, three, four.
Mic check, one, two, three, four.

00:13.472 --> 00:15.891
Special Operator 1st Class Corey Scott

00:15.974 --> 00:18.519
dropped a bombshell
during testimony this morning.

00:18.602 --> 00:22.189
He said he suffocated
the injured ISIS terrorist.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.316
This was truly shocking testimony

00:24.399 --> 00:26.443
that stunned everyone in that courtroom.

00:26.527 --> 00:31.031
And with that, this case
is absolutely turned on its head.

00:32.991 --> 00:38.830
We saw a medic say,
"I'm the guy who killed this captive."

00:38.914 --> 00:41.333
Which is not something
anyone was expecting.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.168
So now we have to make sense of it.

00:44.336 --> 00:48.799
Does that erase what Eddie Gallagher
did in any legal sense?

00:52.386 --> 00:54.847
First time I heard
what Corey Scott said on the stand,

00:54.930 --> 00:56.598
I was just reading updates on my phone.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.268
It was a huge bombshell.

01:00.769 --> 01:04.772
I was shocked. I didn't see
any of that coming out of Corey Scott.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.905
That was a shock. You know,
I lived with Corey the entire time.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.992
And he and I shared a room together,

01:15.951 --> 01:19.204
but he didn't say one word to me
about any of this.

01:19.288 --> 01:23.083
I would think that we had that level of
trust that Corey would share this with us.

01:23.959 --> 01:27.087
But everyone, to my knowledge,
was blindsided by this.

01:28.046 --> 01:31.550
If Corey did do what he said
and suffocated the prisoner,

01:32.301 --> 01:36.263
why was he so willing to launch
the investigation in the first place?

01:37.139 --> 01:39.057
We huddled together as a group.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.935
We're like, "Hey, are you gonna
go through with this or not?"

01:42.019 --> 01:45.689
You think he would have been like,
"Hey, guys, I got something to say.

01:45.772 --> 01:49.818
Like, fucking don't go through with this
because I could go to prison for life."

01:50.819 --> 01:53.405
I, personally, was stunned.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.951
Corey Scott was admitting to murder.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.121
But he had been granted immunity,

02:01.205 --> 02:05.459
which protects the witness
from what they say on the stand.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.088
He could've went to NCIS

02:10.172 --> 02:12.966
and said, "Yeah, I plugged
the breathing tube. Eddie didn't."

02:13.675 --> 02:18.388
But he chose to have this big show fiasco
inside the courtroom.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.436
I don't know why
Corey said these things in trial,

02:25.854 --> 02:29.816
but after that, it was, like,
anything can happen now.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.617
We're here to train and go to war.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.661
I was like, "Hell yeah. Let's do this."

02:43.372 --> 02:46.166
These men were my family, my brothers.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.626
This bond of warfighters.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.091
You could just tell
that something was off.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.344
There was this undercurrent
in this platoon.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.434
How do you sleep at night
knowing what you did?

03:05.310 --> 03:07.187
I just saw it as good versus evil.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.231
It's that simple.

03:28.834 --> 03:29.960
Court will come to order.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.920
All parties previously present
are once again present.

03:33.672 --> 03:36.133
Petty Officer Scott, would you please
return to the witness stand?

03:37.092 --> 03:38.093
Defense?

03:39.094 --> 03:40.095
Yeah.

03:40.804 --> 03:44.057
You didn't say that
Chief Gallagher suffocated him, did you?

03:44.141 --> 03:45.142
No.

03:45.684 --> 03:46.935
Did you suffocate him?

03:47.019 --> 03:48.020
Yes.

03:51.732 --> 03:52.733
How?

03:53.442 --> 03:56.570
After Chief Gallagher left the scene,

03:56.653 --> 03:58.614
I was left there, monitoring him.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.490
I thought he would die.

04:01.200 --> 04:05.746
He was continuing to breathe normally,
as he had been before.

04:06.371 --> 04:11.084
So, I held my thumb over his ET tube
until he stopped breathing.

04:14.129 --> 04:17.798
That was a huge, like, holy shit moment.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.051
Like, you cannot make this up.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.844
Now somebody else
is fessing up to the murder.

04:20.928 --> 04:25.682
I don't think that people can relate
to how surreal all of this was for us.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.894
Like, okay, is the military
gonna drop this case now?

04:28.977 --> 04:31.230
The government's own witness

04:31.313 --> 04:33.232
admitted to the killing
that they had charged Eddie for,

04:33.315 --> 04:34.900
and for months had villainized him for.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.693
Like, that whole situation is fucked up.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.573
I asked you
multiple times what happened

04:41.657 --> 04:44.284
after Chief Gallagher
had stabbed the prisoner.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.369
Did I not?

04:45.452 --> 04:46.453
Yes.

04:46.537 --> 04:49.206
And never once did you mention
in the October meeting

04:49.289 --> 04:53.877
that he had asphyxiated or that
you had covered his tube, did you?

04:54.461 --> 04:57.214
I don't remember the exact language
that I used in that meeting.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.133
Well…
In fact, what you said was…

05:02.135 --> 05:04.763
after Gallagher stabbed the individual,
Scott believed

05:04.847 --> 05:08.058
that there was nothing medically
he could have done for these injuries.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.520
So, he stayed next to the prisoner
until he stopped breathing.

05:12.896 --> 05:13.897
Yes.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.566
So, "Until he stopped breathing."

05:15.649 --> 05:19.444
You never said in any way that you were
the one who made him stop breathing.

05:19.528 --> 05:20.821
No, I didn't say that.

05:21.446 --> 05:25.742
Everybody was, like, okay, these guys
are in a bind and they're ticked.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.162
The prosecution is disgusted and upset.

05:29.246 --> 05:33.083
And the judge says, "Defense,
would you like to, you know, recross?"

05:33.166 --> 05:34.168
"Yes, Judge, I would."

05:35.794 --> 05:39.673
How many times
did you say to the prosecutors,

05:39.756 --> 05:42.009
"The ISIS fighter asphyxiated"?

05:43.802 --> 05:44.970
"Yeah, at least once or twice."

05:45.637 --> 05:48.098
Did they ever ask you
the follow-up question of, "How?"

05:48.182 --> 05:49.183
No.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.477
How many times did they say,
"What do you mean 'asphyxiated'?

05:52.561 --> 05:53.854
I thought he died of a stab wound."

05:54.980 --> 05:56.899
Did NCIS ever ask you this question?

05:56.982 --> 05:57.983
No.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.527
Am I the first person
outside of your legal team

06:00.611 --> 06:02.696
to ever ask you this question?

06:04.198 --> 06:05.574
Yes.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.202
The prosecution screwed this thing up.

06:08.285 --> 06:11.705
They didn't listen
and didn't ask the question. Only we did.

06:15.918 --> 06:20.380
Corey backtracked
on several of the things that he told me

06:20.464 --> 06:21.715
during our forensic interview.

06:21.798 --> 06:27.304
I crossed over and asked a probative
question every single which way I could

06:27.387 --> 06:30.057
regarding whether he touched
that cric tube or not.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.100
"Did you ever put the tube in him?" "No."

06:32.184 --> 06:34.394
"Did you see who put the tube in him?"
"No."

06:34.478 --> 06:38.232
"Did you ever touch the tube in any way?"
"No."

06:38.315 --> 06:41.109
"Did you ever put your hand
over the tube in any way?

06:41.193 --> 06:45.614
In other words, to block respiration
and suffocate this person.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.741
Asphyxiate this person. Right?

06:47.824 --> 06:49.409
Did you ever do that?" "No."

06:49.493 --> 06:51.787
But then when he gets on the stand,

06:51.870 --> 06:53.956
for whatever reason or motivation,

06:54.039 --> 06:57.251
decides to not tell the truth
or tell a different story.

06:59.795 --> 07:02.965
Petty Officer Scott
was interviewed multiple times

07:03.048 --> 07:04.258
throughout the investigation.

07:04.341 --> 07:08.136
He was one of the initial witnesses
that NCIS interviewed.

07:08.220 --> 07:13.267
At each stage, at each interview,
he reiterated what he had seen.

07:13.851 --> 07:17.271
While I was at the head, all of a sudden,
Eddie's stabbing this dude in the neck.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.774
Do you remember what transpired

07:20.858 --> 07:23.485
when you're still on scene
after he stabbed him?

07:24.194 --> 07:26.989
I kinda stayed at the dude's head,

07:27.072 --> 07:30.367
and then, like,
for a few minutes until he died.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.788
Every single time
that I sat down with you,

07:34.872 --> 07:36.832
or that NCIS had sat down with you,

07:36.915 --> 07:40.544
they asked you what had happened after
he had stabbed the prisoner, correct?

07:41.545 --> 07:42.546
Yes.

07:43.755 --> 07:47.217
The prosecutors were down,
and they knew it.

07:47.301 --> 07:50.053
And they were really angry.

07:50.137 --> 07:55.350
There was talk about, "How can we
charge Corey Scott with perjury?"

07:55.434 --> 07:59.271
But there's nothing they can do
because he had immunity.

07:59.897 --> 08:03.692
Only now, when you have
your grant of testimonial immunity--

08:03.775 --> 08:06.236
And you understand,
any statement that you say right now,

08:06.320 --> 08:08.822
you cannot be prosecuted for,
for anything other than perjury.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.324
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.117
And so, you can stand up there.

08:12.201 --> 08:15.621
You can lie about how the fact
that you killed the ISIS prisoner,

08:15.704 --> 08:17.873
because you don't want
Chief Gallagher to go to jail.

08:17.956 --> 08:22.002
No, if I lied, I would lose my grant
of testimonial immunity.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.756
Immunity is something that is rare.

08:25.839 --> 08:30.928
And in this case, he had every opportunity
under the grant of immunity

08:31.011 --> 08:34.347
to tell the government
that he asphyxiated the prisoner,

08:34.431 --> 08:36.933
and waited until trial.

08:38.143 --> 08:42.356
The Navy was really hesitant
because immunity is a dangerous deal.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.733
It can blow up in your face very easily.

08:46.151 --> 08:49.905
But Corey Scott had a lawyer
who forced the hand.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.157
A guy named Brian Ferguson.

08:52.741 --> 08:55.452
Mr. Ferguson,
we'll invite you to share with the court

08:55.536 --> 08:58.288
what you believe this grant
of testimonial immunity means,

08:58.372 --> 09:00.290
and then I can tell you
whether you're correct.

09:00.374 --> 09:02.793
I appreciate it, sir,
and I have no doubt that you can,

09:02.876 --> 09:05.546
because I do get the sense
you are much smarter than I am.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.090
And I don't say that to suck up.

09:09.758 --> 09:15.222
At the trial, people were looking at him
and wondering, "Who-- Who is this guy?"

09:16.974 --> 09:21.103
Brian Ferguson was the bane
in the side of the government,

09:21.186 --> 09:25.357
and he ended up representing
half of the platoon.

09:26.942 --> 09:32.573
Brian Ferguson is the most bizarre,
oddball guy I ever met,

09:32.656 --> 09:34.324
but he's a really good lawyer.

09:37.035 --> 09:40.706
He was workin' the government.
He was workin' the defense.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.418
This was a sporting event to him.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.798
What to say about Brian Ferguson?

09:49.882 --> 09:53.177
I've talked to him several times, and I
still don't know what to make of him.

09:53.844 --> 09:57.556
All he'll say is that he doesn't really
have to worry about working much.

09:58.140 --> 10:01.018
And so, as either a hobby or as charity,

10:01.101 --> 10:03.896
he represents SEALs
who are in trouble for free.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.733
He came in immediately

10:07.816 --> 10:14.698
when the platoon reported Eddie Gallagher
to NCIS in April of 2018.

10:15.365 --> 10:20.329
At the time,
the platoon knew nothing about the law.

10:20.412 --> 10:23.916
They didn't even know that they would
have to testify, most of them, publicly.

10:23.999 --> 10:27.252
And he started scaring the bejesus
out of a lot of guys.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.546
"Hey, you guys need to shut up.
Don't talk to the police.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.048
You're all probably gonna end up in jail.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.300
You probably committed crimes
you don't even know about.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.093
And without a lawyer to protect you,

10:35.177 --> 10:37.804
you know, all of you guys
are gonna get hung out to dry."

11:09.837 --> 11:12.756
Brian Ferguson said to me,
"Honestly, what I think's gonna happen

11:12.840 --> 11:17.594
is they're going to extradite you to Iraq
to be charged for war crimes.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.430
Eddie's gonna get off, and he's
gonna write a book and get a movie,

11:20.514 --> 11:22.015
and you guys are gonna be
sitting in jail."

11:22.099 --> 11:24.643
You know, and I'm thinking--
I didn't know anything at the time.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.020
I'm not an attorney.
I didn't know anything about war crimes.

11:28.105 --> 11:31.149
Ferguson started
representing one SEAL after another

11:31.233 --> 11:35.445
that was involved in the case
but not charged in the case.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.824
He had Corey Scott,
who had seen the stabbing.

11:38.907 --> 11:43.036
He had Ivan Villanueva,
who had seen the stabbing.

11:43.120 --> 11:46.790
He had Joe Arrington,
who had seen one of the shootings.

11:47.708 --> 11:52.129
Josh Graffam, who could possibly
corroborate one of the other shootings.

11:52.629 --> 11:56.800
These were key witnesses,
and Brian Ferguson's biggest priority

11:56.884 --> 11:59.386
was to get immunity
for all of his clients.

12:00.596 --> 12:02.472
When I was a federal prosecutor,

12:02.556 --> 12:05.058
I don't think I ever
gave anybody immunity.

12:05.142 --> 12:10.272
I think that Eddie's case
was so politicized and so controversial

12:10.355 --> 12:13.525
that Brian Ferguson,
and perhaps other people,

12:14.401 --> 12:19.907
were trading these immunity deals
like they were baseball cards.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.076
To see this growing number

12:23.160 --> 12:27.039
of witnesses have Brian Ferguson
representing them…

12:27.122 --> 12:31.502
In my ten years as a judge advocate,
I had never seen a case

12:31.585 --> 12:34.004
where so many grants of immunity
were issued.

12:34.087 --> 12:38.300
What happened with Corey Scott
happens in mob cases all the time.

12:38.383 --> 12:41.970
You get someone in the gang who
decides they're gonna take the fall,

12:42.054 --> 12:43.972
and the prosecutor gives them immunity.

12:44.056 --> 12:47.768
And then they get up on the stand,
and they take credit for everything.

12:47.851 --> 12:51.855
And then they can't prosecute that person,
and everybody walks.

12:52.523 --> 12:55.275
Ferguson kept sending me
emails and text messages saying,

12:55.359 --> 12:58.487
"You're really at risk here
for prosecution

12:58.570 --> 13:01.073
based on what Eddie has told the Navy."

13:01.156 --> 13:05.369
And so, I just got a bad feeling.
I didn't wanna be represented by him.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.955
There are two clear groups at this point.

13:08.038 --> 13:11.750
Those that were represented by Brian,
and those that were not,

13:11.834 --> 13:14.336
which were more
on the crucify Eddie train.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.173
If you look back at guys
who gave their first interview

13:18.257 --> 13:20.008
and then lawyered up with Brian Ferguson,

13:20.092 --> 13:22.010
there is a huge difference
between their testimony.

13:22.094 --> 13:24.805
Mr. Graffam, good afternoon.

13:24.888 --> 13:25.973
Good afternoon, sir.

13:27.266 --> 13:29.685
Josh Graffam was one of the SEALs

13:29.768 --> 13:32.479
spotting for Eddie Gallagher
in the sniper tower.

13:32.563 --> 13:35.148
He initially didn't want to testify.

13:35.232 --> 13:38.569
And then
Ferguson got him an immunity deal.

13:39.194 --> 13:43.031
Okay, directing your attention
to early June 2017.

13:43.115 --> 13:47.327
Were you working the spot
for Chief Gallagher around that time?

13:47.411 --> 13:48.412
Yes.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.080
Please describe that for the jury.

13:51.582 --> 13:53.667
The target I called out for, for him,

13:53.750 --> 13:55.252
they were two males.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.588
In my opinion, these were two shitheads.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.883
When you say "shithead,"
you mean an ISIS terrorist?

14:00.966 --> 14:02.342
-ISIS, yes.
-Okay.

14:02.426 --> 14:05.053
I called them out to Eddie.

14:05.137 --> 14:06.889
What did he do in response?

14:06.972 --> 14:08.182
He took the shot.

14:09.349 --> 14:13.520
Graffam basically challenged
the whole narrative

14:13.604 --> 14:15.397
around the sniper killings.

14:15.480 --> 14:19.443
He directly contradicted Dylan Dille.

14:20.527 --> 14:24.156
Later that day, did you debrief this event
with anybody else in the platoon?

14:24.823 --> 14:27.409
Slightly. It was talked about

14:27.492 --> 14:29.953
amongst myself and Dylan Dille.

14:30.037 --> 14:33.707
He had disagreement with whether or not
the shot should have been taken.

14:35.209 --> 14:38.337
I, on the other hand, was confident
that the right shot was taken.

14:40.923 --> 14:44.218
It's a flat-out lie
that Graffam and I had a discussion

14:44.301 --> 14:47.846
about whether or not the old man
was an ISIS shithead.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.099
There was no discussion.
There was no back and forth.

14:51.183 --> 14:54.811
It was a mutual understanding
of what happened, and he was upset.

14:55.771 --> 14:58.232
As far as that story
about the old man in Iraq,

14:58.315 --> 15:01.318
Josh Graffam had mentioned to us
that it was bothering him

15:01.401 --> 15:03.737
because he kept seeing this memory
over and over.

15:04.530 --> 15:07.783
His story on the stand
is a complete 180 from reality.

15:08.659 --> 15:11.620
I'm just thinking to myself,
like, "How's this even happening?

15:11.703 --> 15:13.038
I mean, something's at play."

15:15.499 --> 15:17.167
Well, I can really only speculate

15:17.251 --> 15:21.588
about what happened
between Ferguson and the defense,

15:21.672 --> 15:25.133
but what is clear
is that there was cooperation there.

15:25.676 --> 15:28.512
This was a very choreographed thing
from the beginning.

15:31.890 --> 15:35.352
I do know that the two legal teams,

15:35.435 --> 15:39.022
Ferguson, Parlatore,
I think they talked a lot.

15:40.190 --> 15:46.238
I think that Parlatore went right up
to the line of legal deniability,

15:46.321 --> 15:47.865
and he really went into the courtroom

15:47.948 --> 15:52.578
not knowing what Scott would say
about covering the tube.

15:52.661 --> 15:55.998
But he also knew exactly
what he was gonna say.

15:56.081 --> 15:58.083
And he barely misses a beat

15:58.166 --> 16:01.712
when Scott blows this giant bombshell
in the courtroom

16:01.795 --> 16:04.214
and says, "Eddie didn't kill him. I did."

16:04.298 --> 16:07.551
Not even a stammer.
All he does is say, "Heh!"

16:08.385 --> 16:10.179
And then he just keeps going.

16:11.805 --> 16:15.225
Brian Ferguson made Corey Scott

16:15.309 --> 16:18.228
and some of his other clients
available to me to speak.

16:18.312 --> 16:20.689
But I really didn't know
what he was gonna say.

16:21.899 --> 16:23.901
Ultimately, we knew

16:25.110 --> 16:28.113
what Corey Scott
was gonna say at the trial.

16:29.448 --> 16:32.910
We were confident
after interviewing Corey Scott…

16:35.370 --> 16:39.791
that Eddie was gonna have a great case.

16:47.132 --> 16:52.095
Ferguson was definitely a key component
in everything that went on.

16:52.721 --> 16:55.724
He knows more about the case than anybody.

16:55.807 --> 16:59.186
He was like, "My clients don't want
to testify. They want to help you."

16:59.770 --> 17:02.272
So, yeah. He was definitely
an integral part in everything.

17:04.397 --> 17:08.487
A few days
before Corey Scott was going to testify,

17:08.569 --> 17:12.366
I remember seeing him and Eddie Gallagher

17:13.031 --> 17:14.617
yukkin' it up in the hallway.

17:14.701 --> 17:20.958
It was really odd
that they seemed to be very friendly,

17:21.040 --> 17:25.420
and days later,
I-- I think we all figured out why.

17:28.799 --> 17:31.343
I never expected one of our boys
to turn against us.

17:32.344 --> 17:35.722
Corey Scott was the one
who encouraged all of us to come forward.

17:36.682 --> 17:39.309
So, if Corey Scott
really plugged the breathing tube,

17:39.393 --> 17:41.395
I couldn't tell you what his motive was.

17:42.396 --> 17:44.273
Why did you kill him?

17:44.356 --> 17:46.024
Because I wanted to save him

17:46.108 --> 17:49.820
from waking up to whatever
was gonna happen next to him.

17:50.404 --> 17:53.407
On the stand, Corey Scott said,

17:53.490 --> 17:57.744
"I killed him because I was afraid
that the Iraqis would do worse."

17:57.828 --> 18:01.456
You've seen them torture,
rape, and murder prisoners.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.541
Yes.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.877
-You've listened to this?
-Yes.

18:04.960 --> 18:08.422
Is this why you… asphyxiated?

18:09.715 --> 18:10.716
Yes.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.100
Very early on in the deployment,

18:20.184 --> 18:25.856
we were colocated with the Iraqi division
that was clearing Mosul with us.

18:26.648 --> 18:32.654
And I occupied a room that was
next to one of their secret prisons.

18:36.575 --> 18:38.869
And each and every single night
for months,

18:39.369 --> 18:41.830
we would hear what sounded like torture.

18:43.081 --> 18:46.418
We would hear men screaming,
crying out in pain.

18:46.502 --> 18:48.462
We would hear muffled gunshots.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.967
In Mosul, we literally shared a wall

18:54.051 --> 18:55.552
with the Iraqi torture chamber.

18:57.679 --> 19:01.058
It's a cinder block wall, but, you know,
it only muffles so much.

19:02.059 --> 19:03.852
You could hear guys screaming.

19:04.353 --> 19:08.357
And you could hear them-- Like,
what sounded like a guy getting shocked.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.109
They made 'em, like, bark like dogs.

19:12.069 --> 19:14.821
It's very interesting when we talk about,

19:14.905 --> 19:17.783
you know, our American morality
and the way that we fought our battle,

19:17.866 --> 19:20.744
and then sitting next to,
for all intents and purposes,

19:21.495 --> 19:24.373
you know, a secret execution
and torture chamber.

19:24.915 --> 19:27.376
Absolutely,
we should not be in bed with that.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.586
But does it happen?

19:32.297 --> 19:34.925
As far as the Iraqi torture house…

19:35.008 --> 19:37.469
Yeah,
there's no denying that it was there.

19:37.553 --> 19:40.973
And I have no doubt that that dude
would eventually have been killed.

19:41.056 --> 19:46.186
But medics don't just kill their patients,
even if it is for a mercy killing.

19:46.270 --> 19:49.064
The Corey that I know
would not have done that.

19:49.857 --> 19:53.402
I don't know why Corey said
what he said during Eddie's trial,

19:53.485 --> 19:56.989
but the last thing Corey told me
right before he went into trial…

19:57.072 --> 19:59.408
He said, "I just feel really bad

19:59.491 --> 20:01.869
that Eddie's gonna go to jail
for the rest of his life

20:01.952 --> 20:04.538
and his kids aren't gonna have a father
or anything

20:04.621 --> 20:07.165
over a stupid Iraqi ISIS fighter."

20:07.249 --> 20:10.919
And my response was, "Well, dude,
you're not the one that walked in there

20:11.003 --> 20:12.379
and stabbed the kid in the neck.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.882
You're not the one
that committed the war crime.

20:14.965 --> 20:17.217
Eddie made his bed,
and he's gonna have to lay in it."

20:17.759 --> 20:19.386
Corey is like, "I know, man.

20:19.469 --> 20:23.056
I know what he did was wrong,
but I just-- I feel so bad about it."

20:23.140 --> 20:26.393
And then Corey testified
that he killed the kid, which--

20:27.686 --> 20:30.731
I don't believe for a minute
that that's actually what happened.

20:33.483 --> 20:36.111
After Corey Scott testified,

20:36.195 --> 20:38.655
the prosecution was just lost.

20:38.739 --> 20:41.158
How do you come back from that?

20:41.241 --> 20:42.868
What do you do?

20:42.951 --> 20:46.079
You had a witness
that you were counting on

20:46.163 --> 20:48.957
to really, really make your case
and drive that home.

20:49.541 --> 20:54.087
And that witness, instead,
testified for the defense.

20:54.171 --> 20:59.468
The lawyers knew that that had put
the most important charge in jeopardy.

20:59.551 --> 21:03.263
But he also said that he saw the chief
stab the prisoner in the neck.

21:05.307 --> 21:09.144
I remember thinking, you know,
he still said he watched him stab him.

21:09.228 --> 21:13.398
Even if Corey Scott ended up
killing the guy, that's attempted murder.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.861
While cause of death is now gone,

21:18.362 --> 21:21.406
I still have an attempted murder charge
to deal with.

21:21.490 --> 21:25.953
If Eddie makes a fatal wound
of any kind to the captive,

21:26.036 --> 21:28.247
even if the captive
dies from something else,

21:28.914 --> 21:30.791
Eddie's still on the hook for murder.

21:32.376 --> 21:34.711
You had how many Navy SEALs
get on the stand,

21:34.795 --> 21:37.339
saying that Eddie Gallagher
stabbed a prisoner in the neck?

21:37.422 --> 21:38.882
And then you had Eddie himself,

21:38.966 --> 21:40.759
in his private text messages
to his friend,

21:40.843 --> 21:42.636
saying that he got him
with his hunting knife.

21:42.719 --> 21:45.514
I mean, you know, what more do you want?

21:45.597 --> 21:48.600
Closing arguments are
getting underway this week in California

21:48.684 --> 21:51.562
in the case of Chief Eddie Gallagher.

21:51.645 --> 21:53.689
The prosecution said the text messages

21:53.772 --> 21:57.150
and pictures that Gallagher took
with the body of the Iraqi teen

21:57.234 --> 21:59.236
are direct evidence of his guilt.

21:59.319 --> 22:02.489
However, the defense said,
"No body, no evidence, no case."

22:02.573 --> 22:07.077
It'll now be up to seven active duty
combat veterans to come to a decision.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.289
What was on the line for Eddie
was the rest of his life in prison.

22:11.498 --> 22:14.960
This was the highest of high stakes.

22:21.175 --> 22:23.260
When the jury went back to deliberate,

22:24.178 --> 22:26.430
it was nerve-racking for sure.

22:26.513 --> 22:30.642
There was a lot of waiting around.
You don't know what to expect.

22:30.726 --> 22:32.561
-Reporter: Morning, Chief.
-Eddie: Good morning.

22:32.644 --> 22:35.189
Reporter: Are you concerned
it's taking a little longer than hoped?

22:35.272 --> 22:36.607
Eddie: No.

22:36.690 --> 22:38.192
-Reporter: Still confident?
-Eddie: Yes.

22:39.276 --> 22:42.279
And the next morning, it came out,
like, hey, jury's got their decision.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.115
We got called back in.

22:49.494 --> 22:50.954
And we stood up.

22:52.247 --> 22:55.584
And the foreperson,
who was a naval commander, said,

22:55.667 --> 22:57.794
"In the matter
of The United States of America

22:57.878 --> 23:04.718
v. Special Operations Chief
Edward Gallagher on the charge of murder,

23:05.719 --> 23:08.722
we the jury find the defendant--"

23:09.515 --> 23:11.767
And time stopped.

23:12.935 --> 23:16.730
And the world
stopped rotating on its axis.

23:17.564 --> 23:21.735
And I could feel Eddie's energy vibrating.

23:22.986 --> 23:24.947
It was probably
the scariest moment in my life.

23:25.030 --> 23:27.866
I felt like my heart was gonna,
like, come leaping out of my chest.

23:28.825 --> 23:30.744
There's no more media.
There's no more nothing.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.955
There's no more trial.

23:33.038 --> 23:35.874
Your whole life for the past two years
has been up to this point. Boom.

23:37.125 --> 23:39.378
"On count one, not guilty.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.421
Not guilty. Not guilty. Guilty.

23:42.714 --> 23:44.508
Not guilty. Not guilty."

23:45.259 --> 23:48.220
We heard, "Not guilty, not guilty,
not guilty, not guilty, not guilty."

23:48.303 --> 23:49.888
But there was a "guilty."

23:51.056 --> 23:53.976
I remember just standing there,
like, hearing a lot of "not guiltys."

23:54.059 --> 23:56.812
But that one "guilty,"
I'm like, "Holy shit, what is that?"

23:56.895 --> 24:00.566
All of us were like, "What one is guilty?
Like, what does that mean?"

24:01.441 --> 24:03.694
And then Tim, I think,
pretty quickly looked on the sheet.

24:03.777 --> 24:06.822
And I turned to him
with a big smile on my face.

24:08.031 --> 24:09.658
And I said, "It's just the photo.

24:11.952 --> 24:13.620
It's just the photo.

24:14.204 --> 24:15.414
You beat it."

24:17.958 --> 24:19.668
Alcohol and tattoos for everybody.

24:19.751 --> 24:20.919
Yeah.

24:21.003 --> 24:25.424
He's not facing life.
He's not facing any more prison time.

24:25.507 --> 24:27.759
You know,
the maximum sentence on the photo

24:27.843 --> 24:31.013
is well below the time
he's already served.

24:31.096 --> 24:32.723
He is free.

24:32.806 --> 24:35.434
I was in disbelief.
Our hearts were pumping.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.311
It's over. Not guilty. We're done.

24:37.394 --> 24:39.438
And that's when we all
just burst into tears.

24:39.521 --> 24:43.567
I mean, it was a very emotional moment
that we all experienced,

24:43.650 --> 24:46.278
and I was sitting directly behind Eddie.

24:46.361 --> 24:47.779
I was, like, in a state of shock.

24:47.863 --> 24:49.740
Like, still--
I mean, people were hugging me.

24:49.823 --> 24:51.742
Andrea, she was crying.

24:53.827 --> 24:54.828
Then…

24:56.288 --> 24:58.373
I remember, like, walking out and seeing--

24:58.457 --> 25:01.543
You know, I had all these Team guys there
that were there supporting me.

25:01.627 --> 25:03.045
And all of them were bawling.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.131
It was huge.

25:07.132 --> 25:09.009
It was like a big win for everybody.

25:09.885 --> 25:11.345
That was a crazy feeling.

25:12.137 --> 25:13.263
For sure.

25:16.225 --> 25:19.311
When I heard the verdict of the trial,
my jaw just dropped.

25:20.938 --> 25:22.022
I couldn't believe it.

25:25.025 --> 25:26.735
I was so pissed off.

25:27.402 --> 25:29.279
The first person I texted was Dylan.

25:29.363 --> 25:33.367
He is not guilty of murdering
that ISIS prisoner in 2017…

25:33.450 --> 25:37.663
When I first heard the verdict,
it felt like I was falling in a void.

25:37.746 --> 25:39.790
It was sickening to me to know

25:39.873 --> 25:43.126
that Eddie Gallagher was gonna be
walking the streets a free man.

25:45.420 --> 25:47.047
After the Gallagher trial,

25:47.714 --> 25:49.758
there were a lot of people
who were really kind of stunned.

25:51.093 --> 25:53.220
But we couldn't catch a break anywhere.

25:54.388 --> 25:59.393
The special warfare community was not all
on board with what Chief Gallagher did.

25:59.476 --> 26:02.187
It was a very divisive situation
that was going on.

26:03.772 --> 26:08.443
The community needs to police
its own community, and it wanted to.

26:10.195 --> 26:14.449
We definitely wanted to make sure
that there was a peer review board,

26:14.533 --> 26:18.620
and this would be the final period
on the end of this situation.

26:19.121 --> 26:20.455
Here's what we were trying to do.

26:20.539 --> 26:24.501
Chief Gallagher would stand
before a board of his peers.

26:24.585 --> 26:26.628
They would read his file,

26:26.712 --> 26:31.091
and they would decide whether
he gets to keep his trident or not.

26:33.427 --> 26:36.263
The Navy SEAL trident is big.

26:36.346 --> 26:38.015
It's gold.

26:38.098 --> 26:40.475
It signifies an elite status.

26:42.102 --> 26:44.771
Taking that away is a huge deal.

26:44.855 --> 26:48.817
It doesn't happen
without you doing something

26:48.901 --> 26:51.528
that brings dishonor on the Teams.

26:53.447 --> 26:58.577
Richard Spencer is the civilian
overseeing the entire Navy.

26:58.660 --> 27:02.664
He's almost like a circuit breaker
between civilian and military worlds.

27:02.748 --> 27:05.709
And what he really wanted to avoid

27:05.792 --> 27:11.924
was any more conflict
between the president and the military.

27:14.635 --> 27:17.471
I spoke to the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs, and I said,

27:17.554 --> 27:20.349
"If you could put a word in
with the president

27:20.432 --> 27:22.518
that this is tribal business,

27:23.310 --> 27:26.313
If he could just stand back
and let the process work--

27:26.396 --> 27:30.484
Let us convene the peer review board
because this is their business."

27:32.110 --> 27:35.239
I thought we actually had a clear path
to a good outcome,

27:35.322 --> 27:36.698
and that was not the case.

27:38.158 --> 27:41.662
The Gallaghers thought it was unfair
that he would be punished at all.

27:41.745 --> 27:43.664
They weren't gonna let it rest.

27:43.747 --> 27:46.500
What's the rationale
for all the things they're still doing?

27:46.583 --> 27:48.877
It's vindictiveness.
We went through the process

27:48.961 --> 27:51.213
and came out victorious, and yet--

27:51.296 --> 27:54.550
and yet, they are still trying to,
as Eddie said, put their thumb on him.

27:54.633 --> 27:56.468
What would your message be
to the president?

27:56.552 --> 27:58.804
To the commander-in-chief
who has been monitoring this case

27:58.887 --> 28:01.598
-throughout the process?
-Yeah. Once again, I'd like to say,

28:01.682 --> 28:03.684
"Thank you for stepping in
and doing the right thing

28:03.767 --> 28:05.811
and being the true leader that you are."

28:05.894 --> 28:11.358
And you know, they--
He's probably looking at this in dismay.

28:11.441 --> 28:12.985
They played the Fox fiddle beautifully,

28:13.068 --> 28:15.237
and it went, you know,
right into the White House.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.739
With Eddie Gallagher,
you know that story very well,

28:17.823 --> 28:20.742
they wanted to take his pin away, and I
said, "No, you're not gonna take it away."

28:20.826 --> 28:25.080
He was a great fighter.
He was the-- one of the ultimate fighters.

28:25.163 --> 28:28.542
And… we're gonna protect our warfighters.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.712
I got a call from
the Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper,

28:31.795 --> 28:35.299
who said "The Gallagher thing
has just gone too far.

28:35.382 --> 28:37.009
I'm gonna have to fire you."

28:39.553 --> 28:43.015
We thought we had the case
pretty well tucked in and all over with.

28:43.098 --> 28:44.975
So it was a bit of a surprise.

28:45.058 --> 28:49.605
The Secretary of the Navy is out of a job
after disagreements with the president.

28:49.688 --> 28:51.064
It comes following a dispute

28:51.148 --> 28:54.234
over the case of a Navy SEAL
accused of war crimes.

28:54.318 --> 28:57.196
I don't think he really understands
the full definition of a warfighter.

28:57.279 --> 28:59.573
A warfighter is a profession of arms,

28:59.656 --> 29:02.993
and a profession of arms has
standards that they have to be held to

29:03.076 --> 29:04.453
and they hold themselves to.

29:08.081 --> 29:09.958
I made a statement
that I didn't really think

29:10.042 --> 29:12.961
the president understood
how the military works.

29:13.045 --> 29:15.214
The disservice he did
to the rest of the service members

29:15.297 --> 29:17.758
who were doing the right thing
is meaningful.

29:17.841 --> 29:20.344
And the fact
that the president got involved,

29:20.427 --> 29:21.803
in my eyes, was inappropriate.

29:21.887 --> 29:24.932
Does he have the right to do it? Yes,
he does. Is it the right thing to do? No.

29:27.935 --> 29:33.315
After firing Spencer,
the president lets the whole Navy know

29:33.398 --> 29:36.902
nobody is going to take
Eddie Gallagher's trident.

29:36.985 --> 29:39.613
Stop what you're doing. Get back to work.

29:43.116 --> 29:45.118
The president's attention on this case,

29:45.202 --> 29:47.621
his willingness to back this guy--

29:48.121 --> 29:53.293
And then, in addition, the jury
refusing to hold this guy accountable

29:53.377 --> 29:55.879
had this really broad ripple effect.

29:57.923 --> 30:00.926
After the fallout from the Gallagher case,

30:01.009 --> 30:05.013
other pending war crime investigations
were dropped.

30:06.932 --> 30:09.893
Essentially, the Navy decided they
weren't gonna jump in that realm again.

30:12.354 --> 30:15.440
At that point,
everybody just gave up on justice.

30:15.524 --> 30:17.818
They're like, "There is no justice here."

30:17.901 --> 30:22.281
And for us, a lot of us, honestly,
that's really all we were looking for.

30:22.364 --> 30:25.367
We just wanted
some sort of accountability in some way.

30:32.165 --> 30:33.292
After the trial,

30:33.375 --> 30:36.295
the persecution from my command
just escalated.

30:38.046 --> 30:41.300
It was like one thing after the next.

30:43.510 --> 30:48.432
Without Trump, we would be,
who knows-- you know, broke, in debt.

30:52.227 --> 30:55.439
And that was my decision point.
Like, yes, I'm fucking retiring.

30:55.522 --> 30:58.817
Like, I'm getting out.
This is-- That's it for me.

31:13.624 --> 31:16.752
After the trial ended, I made my decision.
I was getting out.

31:19.379 --> 31:23.217
I found a program where I could
move my family out of the state

31:23.300 --> 31:26.136
and I could be transferred
to another command.

31:26.720 --> 31:29.640
This is what I call
my personal witness protection program.

31:31.808 --> 31:32.851
Perfect.

31:32.935 --> 31:35.312
I eventually decided to leave the Teams.

31:36.647 --> 31:39.066
It was just, you know, time to move on.

31:40.192 --> 31:42.778
The fallout
from the-- the trial and investigation

31:42.861 --> 31:45.697
kinda galvanized my decision to get out.

31:49.034 --> 31:53.205
One takeaway from this whole thing
is that you find out who your friends are.

31:54.998 --> 31:57.668
I guess I'm upset with people
that, you know, lost the courage

31:57.751 --> 31:59.503
to go forward and do what was right.

32:00.671 --> 32:05.717
There's a line in the sand now.
The circle of trust has gotten smaller.

32:06.927 --> 32:09.471
I absolutely feel sadness

32:09.555 --> 32:12.766
in losing friends
that I was once really close with.

32:14.017 --> 32:16.061
I think the average person
wouldn't understand

32:16.144 --> 32:18.230
exactly what that bond entails.

32:18.313 --> 32:22.442
And then having it
kind of fall apart like it did.

32:23.402 --> 32:25.779
I don't think there's anybody
in the platoon

32:25.863 --> 32:29.366
that can say, honestly,
that they didn't get emotional about it.

32:31.243 --> 32:36.039
This is a tragedy.
Nobody wins in this story.

32:36.999 --> 32:40.294
The Navy doesn't win. NCIS doesn't win.

32:40.377 --> 32:44.089
Eddie Gallagher doesn't win.
The country doesn't win.

32:44.798 --> 32:46.967
This is a loss for everyone involved.

32:47.050 --> 32:50.179
This is a loss of friendship.
This is a loss of brotherhood.

32:50.971 --> 32:56.310
The way that these men fissured
and broke and what they did--

32:56.393 --> 32:57.728
I can't imagine some of these men

32:57.811 --> 32:59.688
still being able
to look each other in the eye.

33:04.443 --> 33:07.196
Recently, I got a text from Corey Scott

33:07.279 --> 33:09.198
saying he was visiting near me

33:09.281 --> 33:11.325
and wanted to know
if I would meet up with him.

33:11.408 --> 33:15.120
I said, "Yeah, sure. You know,
let's meet up on my turf. That's fine."

33:16.371 --> 33:18.373
I wanted to hear what he had to say.

33:19.416 --> 33:21.168
We were just catching up,

33:21.251 --> 33:23.086
and I said, "Hey, Corey, you know,

33:23.170 --> 33:26.465
you're the first person
to reach out to me since the-- the trial

33:26.548 --> 33:28.592
from all the guys
that were working with Ferguson."

33:28.675 --> 33:30.719
And he's like,
"Well, how-- how are you now?"

33:30.802 --> 33:33.597
I said,
"Well, I don't know, man. You tell me."

33:36.058 --> 33:39.144
"I'm confused, Corey.
You want to give me answers?"

33:39.728 --> 33:42.814
And he said
he didn't want Eddie to go to jail.

33:44.816 --> 33:48.278
I was like, "Were you working
with the defense? What was going on?"

33:48.362 --> 33:52.157
Corey said, "Tim Parlatore didn't know
what I was going to say.

33:52.241 --> 33:53.992
He knew what questions to ask."

33:54.701 --> 33:57.913
He's like, "You know, it's not my problem
that I'm smarter than NCIS."

33:58.747 --> 34:00.374
I was like, "Corey, what are you saying?

34:00.457 --> 34:02.709
You actually think
you're the puppet master here?

34:02.793 --> 34:03.836
You're a little puppet.

34:03.919 --> 34:07.840
Like, they used you to get Eddie off.
How do you not understand that here?"

34:09.257 --> 34:11.592
You know, he kept just saying
this was water under the bridge.

34:11.677 --> 34:13.094
Every single hard question I'd ask him,

34:13.178 --> 34:16.139
"This is water under the bridge.
I'm just trying to be friends with you."

34:16.223 --> 34:18.891
I'm like, "Corey, you--
you gotta be kidding me here.

34:18.976 --> 34:20.726
Do you know what you put us through?

34:20.811 --> 34:22.062
We trusted our lives with you.

34:22.145 --> 34:25.065
We knew you. You were our friend,
and you came and turned on us.

34:25.148 --> 34:27.693
You screwed us.
You left us burning in that fire.

34:27.775 --> 34:30.279
How do you sleep at night
after what you did?

34:31.112 --> 34:33.489
And you tell me this is
all water under the bridge.

34:33.574 --> 34:36.784
You know, if you want to be friends,
you can go up and go on the news

34:36.869 --> 34:38.996
and tell everyone exactly what happened."

34:39.621 --> 34:42.958
He's like, "You know,
I don't want us to end like this."

34:43.041 --> 34:45.252
So I was like,
"Fuck you. I'm out of here."

34:45.335 --> 34:47.670
And I haven't talked to him since.

34:55.094 --> 34:58.307
I've called Corey
three or four times since I've been out,

34:58.390 --> 34:59.600
just to check up on him.

35:01.560 --> 35:06.023
I think Corey-- He doesn't want
any animosity with those guys.

35:06.106 --> 35:09.818
But they're still stuck on, like--
You know, I--

35:09.902 --> 35:14.823
"He killed, whatever, this ISIS prisoner.
You're a war criminal."

35:17.326 --> 35:21.163
But I didn't do anything wrong.
I mean, this-- this was an ISIS fighter.

35:21.747 --> 35:25.626
He was just trying to kill me
and-- and my platoon, so that's war.

35:30.756 --> 35:32.299
During the trial,

35:33.634 --> 35:35.886
no one really cared
about the ISIS fighter.

35:36.470 --> 35:40.516
The prosecutors even said
when they closed the case,

35:40.599 --> 35:43.393
"This is not a sympathetic person.

35:43.477 --> 35:45.938
You know, he was the ISIS fighter.

35:46.021 --> 35:47.231
He was a terrorist."

35:48.774 --> 35:50.734
No one really ever used his name.

36:01.537 --> 36:03.956
When ISIS took control of the area…

36:06.124 --> 36:10.128
and this sectarianism started spreading,

36:11.463 --> 36:13.674
the situation here got really bad.

36:16.093 --> 36:19.888
At night, they would stop any person
and just kill them.

36:21.557 --> 36:24.059
I mean, those were really bad days.

36:26.812 --> 36:29.147
They were in control of everything.

36:30.190 --> 36:33.110
We were forced to go to the mosques

36:33.777 --> 36:35.696
out of fear for our lives.

36:42.077 --> 36:44.454
His real name was Khalid.

36:46.707 --> 36:48.667
When he joined ISIS,

36:48.750 --> 36:52.254
he changed his name to Ahmad Al-Shourah.

36:52.337 --> 36:54.381
He was about 16 years old.

36:56.425 --> 37:01.346
He was very much attached to me because,
you know, he was my first son.

37:02.931 --> 37:05.309
Wherever I would go,
I would take him with me.

37:06.226 --> 37:07.686
We were inseparable.

37:10.564 --> 37:12.441
He liked soccer.

37:13.734 --> 37:19.531
He used to like the club Real Madrid
from Spain. He loved them a lot.

37:20.657 --> 37:24.995
And I like Barcelona, which is its rival.

37:25.078 --> 37:27.831
I would joke and say,
"Barcelona are going to win."

37:27.915 --> 37:31.335
If Real defeated Barcelona,
he would tease me.

37:35.422 --> 37:37.925
He was very clever in school.

37:38.008 --> 37:40.636
Every year, he would be
at the top of his class.

37:41.053 --> 37:44.598
I wasn't expecting
that he would take such a path.

37:49.478 --> 37:53.315
In 2016, roughly before Ramadan,

37:54.149 --> 37:57.152
a friend came to me, one of his friends.

37:57.236 --> 38:04.201
And he told me Khalid was going to take
an oath of loyalty to ISIS.

38:06.578 --> 38:09.164
I told him, "Stop. Stay away from it."

38:09.248 --> 38:11.291
I told him, "I will buy you a car.

38:11.375 --> 38:13.502
Whatever you want.
Just don't go down this path.

38:13.585 --> 38:16.338
Take it from me,
this path is a dead end."

38:16.421 --> 38:19.424
I scolded him, I even hit him.
And he started to cry.

38:23.345 --> 38:25.389
He told me he will not go.

38:26.598 --> 38:28.267
I remember, on Saturday,

38:28.934 --> 38:33.438
the same friend came and told me
Khalid has gone.

38:40.028 --> 38:42.239
He used to always do what I told him.

38:42.322 --> 38:44.992
But when this time came to pass,

38:45.075 --> 38:47.119
I don't know, they changed him.

38:52.624 --> 38:54.626
Would he come home?

38:57.004 --> 39:00.132
A day, two days, three days… and a month.

39:00.507 --> 39:02.092
Then he came.

39:03.051 --> 39:05.262
And we looked at each other, face-to-face.

39:05.804 --> 39:08.432
He started to cry, and hugged me.

39:08.515 --> 39:14.438
He said, "Dad, I made a mistake.
Please forgive me."

39:14.521 --> 39:19.026
He said, "I got stuck in this. I was
thinking about jihad and all that talk."

39:19.818 --> 39:22.738
I told him, "Look, quit them.

39:22.821 --> 39:26.617
Turn yourself in and you'll be tried
for this period you were with them.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.452
And you have not hurt anyone, as of yet."

39:28.869 --> 39:30.996
He told me, "Dad, I cannot.

39:31.079 --> 39:33.874
If I quit, they will kill me."

39:37.461 --> 39:40.172
So then quite a bit of time passed by.

39:40.255 --> 39:42.424
My brother came by.

39:42.508 --> 39:46.929
He said,
"You know, Khalid showed up on TV."

39:50.557 --> 39:52.059
What is your name?

39:52.142 --> 39:53.268
Ahmed.

39:54.019 --> 39:56.480
-How old are you?
-Sixteen.

39:56.563 --> 39:59.274
Why did you work with them?
Did they force you or was it your choice?

39:59.942 --> 40:01.527
My father…

40:01.610 --> 40:03.403
-What?
-My father used to hit me.

40:03.487 --> 40:04.488
Your father hit you?

40:04.571 --> 40:06.240
Yes, he hit me
and told me not to join them.

40:06.323 --> 40:07.741
-Your father doesn't accept it, right?
-Yes.

40:07.824 --> 40:10.118
Then why did you go?

40:10.202 --> 40:14.706
Because they tell me it's a good job.

40:15.874 --> 40:18.168
Viewers, he is 17 years old.

40:18.669 --> 40:20.754
He is with ISIS.

40:20.838 --> 40:23.757
As you can see he is a young man
and they fooled him

40:24.591 --> 40:28.846
with their special convincing methods,
and this is the result.

40:28.929 --> 40:32.474
He was shot during the battles and
transferred by the rapid reaction force.

40:32.558 --> 40:37.229
He will be taken to treat his injuries
and they can question him.

40:38.480 --> 40:42.025
I look at the video
and I see that it is Khalid.

40:42.109 --> 40:43.068
My son.

40:49.324 --> 40:51.076
There's more to the story.

40:51.159 --> 40:56.790
The Americans took him from
the Iraqi forces in order to treat him.

40:58.375 --> 40:59.626
During the course of the treatment…

41:03.422 --> 41:05.382
they killed him.

41:12.181 --> 41:18.770
The American forces, they are the ones
who uphold the law, human rights.

41:18.854 --> 41:21.398
If they were to put him on trial
and execute him,

41:21.481 --> 41:22.900
we would have accepted that.

41:24.443 --> 41:29.406
But for the American soldiers
to just kill him like that…

41:30.657 --> 41:33.076
Yes, he was a member of ISIS.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.871
Nobody denies this,
but they shouldn't have killed him.

41:36.413 --> 41:38.207
It's the most difficult thing

41:38.290 --> 41:42.044
for someone to see
their son dying in front of them.

41:45.297 --> 41:50.219
My son was killed like this as a prisoner.

41:50.302 --> 41:52.638
He was only 17 years old.

41:52.721 --> 41:56.892
He was killed by an American officer,
and they talk about human rights

41:56.975 --> 42:00.771
and the liberation of Iraq.
Liberation? What has he liberated?

42:00.854 --> 42:02.648
He didn't come to liberate.
He came to kill.

42:15.118 --> 42:17.788
So it's been
almost two years since the trial,

42:17.871 --> 42:20.874
and the details around this have
kind of expanded a bit.

42:20.958 --> 42:22.918
I don't want to say "changed," but--

42:23.001 --> 42:25.295
No. They've changed. They've expanded.

42:25.379 --> 42:29.007
So, can you tell me,
what really happened here?

42:33.971 --> 42:37.266
When the ISIS fighter incident happened,

42:38.100 --> 42:41.603
the moment he was probably--
he was brought to us was when I was like,

42:41.687 --> 42:42.688
"Fuck this guy."

42:45.232 --> 42:48.110
Nobody had any intention
of saving this dude

42:48.193 --> 42:51.196
or trying to bring him
to a higher level of care.

42:56.118 --> 42:59.872
The way everybody was acting at the time,
it was like it didn't have to be said.

42:59.955 --> 43:02.791
Everybody was on the same page, you know?

43:02.875 --> 43:04.334
And I'm-- Along with me.

43:04.418 --> 43:06.253
Like, I didn't give a shit
what happened to him.

43:06.336 --> 43:09.673
I just knew-- I was like,
we're not gonna execute this guy.

43:09.756 --> 43:11.967
We're not going to--
And-- You know, we're not--

43:12.050 --> 43:14.178
We can't just outright kill this dude
in front of all, like--

43:14.261 --> 43:17.931
So we'll just do medical treatments on him
until he expires.

43:22.561 --> 43:26.648
You know, we'll get
some medical practice out of it.

43:29.318 --> 43:32.154
So we were just, like,
using it as almost like a cadaver.

43:32.237 --> 43:34.698
Like, go ahead and practice it.

43:36.158 --> 43:39.161
We were not trying to save this guy.

43:39.661 --> 43:43.957
And was full on board
with, like, making this guy feel pain.

43:45.042 --> 43:50.130
Is your intention
to kill the guy with these experiments?

43:50.506 --> 43:52.716
Yeah. Pretty much.

43:55.761 --> 43:59.014
It was just an ISIS fighter.
The guy needed to die.

44:01.475 --> 44:03.393
I mean, he was already on death's door.

44:03.477 --> 44:06.647
That air strike
was what brought him to death.

44:06.730 --> 44:10.234
I mean, we just helped it along the way.

44:11.068 --> 44:16.198
I'd say the procedures
were just like a cherry on top, I guess.

44:22.579 --> 44:27.042
Wow. Never heard that.
That's pretty stunning.

44:28.085 --> 44:30.045
I am gobsmacked.

44:30.671 --> 44:34.007
That's a travesty for humanity.

44:35.509 --> 44:39.429
I would sincerely hope that the Navy
has an immediate reaction to that

44:39.513 --> 44:43.475
that is outrage
and that the word gets out.

44:43.559 --> 44:47.688
It violates everything that
the special warfare community is about.

44:50.190 --> 44:51.191
Everything.

44:55.445 --> 44:56.822
Now that the trial's over,

44:56.905 --> 45:01.952
Eddie's gonna start saying
all kinds of crazy stuff 'cause he can.

45:02.035 --> 45:06.081
The best thing he could've done
is just walk away from this whole thing,

45:06.164 --> 45:09.084
ride off into the sunset,
and get away with murder.

45:09.168 --> 45:10.377
But he can't keep his mouth shut.

45:11.837 --> 45:15.716
He wants to just say, "Hey, I just want
to let everyone know I killed this guy,

45:15.799 --> 45:16.967
and I meant to."

45:17.926 --> 45:21.763
I think Eddie can't live with himself
not getting credit.

45:24.224 --> 45:26.977
There was a lot of frustration
at the end of the trial.

45:27.060 --> 45:28.896
I didn't really know where to aim it.

45:28.979 --> 45:32.983
But at the end of the day, you know,
it really wasn't about the system.

45:33.066 --> 45:35.944
It wasn't on the prosecution.
It wasn't on the investigators.

45:36.028 --> 45:37.237
It was on Eddie Gallagher.

45:41.909 --> 45:44.745
Despite Eddie "winning,"

45:44.828 --> 45:46.914
you know, there is some consolation

45:46.997 --> 45:50.584
in the fact
that Eddie will never be a SEAL again.

45:50.667 --> 45:53.712
He will never lead people in combat.

45:55.214 --> 45:57.591
Yes, we want justice to be served,

45:57.674 --> 46:01.053
but if Eddie can't kill
any more innocent people

46:01.136 --> 46:02.971
or get any Americans killed…

46:05.265 --> 46:06.975
that takes precedence over everything.

46:11.855 --> 46:14.525
This case is finished for Eddie Gallagher,

46:14.608 --> 46:19.071
but it's not finished
for the Navy SEAL community.

46:21.657 --> 46:22.908
You know, what does this case mean

46:22.991 --> 46:28.413
for the young teenagers
that are gonna go join the SEALs?

46:28.497 --> 46:33.710
You had half a dozen SEALs
report war crimes,

46:33.794 --> 46:37.256
and they've been dragged through the mud

46:37.339 --> 46:40.968
by media, by their fellow SEALs.

46:41.051 --> 46:43.887
Ultimately they risked all that

46:43.971 --> 46:48.016
and then ended up getting to the result
that was "not guilty."

46:49.852 --> 46:54.481
I can't see that
as anything other than a reason to pause

46:54.565 --> 46:58.360
when you see a war crime in progress.

46:59.194 --> 47:01.238
To have to actually stop and think

47:01.321 --> 47:06.577
about the consequences
of doing the right thing.

47:07.327 --> 47:09.329
It's an absolute shame.

47:09.413 --> 47:13.208
And that's something
that the Navy's gonna have to deal with

47:13.292 --> 47:14.793
for a really long time.

47:21.508 --> 47:24.344
For those members of the Team
that came forward

47:24.428 --> 47:28.140
and started the ball rolling
on this whole Chief Gallagher case,

47:28.223 --> 47:33.937
I'm so wildly impressed
with their ability to do that.

47:34.021 --> 47:38.650
Because this is a very hard thing to do.
You're in a very tight-knit community,

47:38.734 --> 47:43.155
and you're basically turning in a "hero"
in the eyes of many in that community.

47:45.866 --> 47:49.745
The experience of being a whistleblower--

47:49.828 --> 47:53.707
You know, everyone's like, "Oh, man,
you had to feel good about what you did."

47:53.790 --> 47:56.919
Right in the beginning it was like, "No."

47:57.002 --> 48:00.839
Like, this whole thing
turned into a whole circus.

48:01.590 --> 48:03.133
Nothing went the way it should've.

48:04.843 --> 48:07.221
But now that I've had time
to digest everything,

48:07.304 --> 48:10.474
I've realized that there's no way
that I could live with myself

48:10.557 --> 48:14.853
had I not gone forward
and said what I saw.

48:15.979 --> 48:19.024
Because in the end,
I got to get the truth out.

48:19.107 --> 48:20.526
And that's not a lost cause.

48:23.779 --> 48:25.113
I think it should be noted

48:25.197 --> 48:28.033
that Eddie Gallagher
never testified under oath,

48:28.116 --> 48:32.412
and, you know, none of us are surprised.
It shows, you know, the coward that he is.

48:34.248 --> 48:38.585
I can rest my head on the pillow at night
knowing that I did the right thing.

48:38.669 --> 48:42.589
You know, that's truly the approval
that I'm looking for.

48:45.676 --> 48:49.346
America needed to see
that this is not who the SEALs are.

48:49.429 --> 48:52.140
We don't go around killing people
just because we can.

48:52.224 --> 48:53.267
Come on, baby!

48:54.226 --> 48:58.105
I mean, trust me.
We live and breathe for a fight.

48:58.188 --> 49:01.984
But that fight has to be
a moral and ethical fight

49:02.067 --> 49:06.321
and something that we can
look back on 40 years from now

49:06.405 --> 49:10.325
and say, "I am so proud
I was a part of that fight."

49:13.620 --> 49:16.081
The wars we've had
over the past two decades

49:16.164 --> 49:20.252
have been very, very taxing
on the US military.

49:21.920 --> 49:24.381
The thing about these wars is that

49:24.464 --> 49:29.178
the military has never
been given a end goal.

49:31.263 --> 49:36.310
And I think that's left a hole,
in some respects, for ethics.

49:37.436 --> 49:43.233
But you don't get the result you want
by dirtying up your own honor.

49:48.280 --> 49:51.200
You know, are we here to win or not?

49:51.283 --> 49:54.870
It seems that if we play by the rules
that are given to us,

49:55.829 --> 49:58.123
we're not gonna
even come close to winning.

49:59.541 --> 50:02.544
You have to get your hands dirty
a little bit to win.

50:03.462 --> 50:05.547
If I did stab, do I--

50:05.631 --> 50:07.174
No, I don't think I did anything wrong.

50:07.257 --> 50:10.177
Even if I had taken a knife out
and stabbed him, I don't think--

50:11.136 --> 50:14.473
I should not be on trial for murder
for killing an ISIS terrorist.

50:15.891 --> 50:20.938
Like, I stand behind every shot
that I took. I sleep fine at night.

50:26.568 --> 50:31.490
There is no definite line
that's universal.

50:31.573 --> 50:36.578
However, on my deployment,
the line was clear as day,

50:36.662 --> 50:39.206
and Eddie crossed it time and time again.

50:41.625 --> 50:43.126
Oh, dude.

50:52.219 --> 50:55.389
A really experienced operator once said

50:55.472 --> 50:59.476
that you should never
take great joy or great sorrow

50:59.560 --> 51:01.311
when targeting someone.

51:03.188 --> 51:05.649
And when you have the power
to take someone's life,

51:05.732 --> 51:08.026
you should really consider it heavily.

51:09.361 --> 51:10.487
Yeah, it looks good.

51:12.906 --> 51:15.450
These things don't end
when you pull the trigger.

51:16.618 --> 51:19.872
It's a heavy thing
that you'll always walk with.

51:21.498 --> 51:23.250
You know, I'll carry that with me forever.
