WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:01.619
Previously on Wynonna Earp

00:01.650 --> 00:04.019
My master is coming.

00:04.250 --> 00:06.889
- John Henry Holliday.
- Bulshar.

00:06.890 --> 00:08.849
You will do my bidding.

00:08.849 --> 00:10.769
- You're strong, baby girl.
- Waverly?

00:10.769 --> 00:12.780
- Mama.
- Get out!! Go!!

00:12.780 --> 00:15.010
Michelle Gibson's finally gonna
slay her little demon child.

00:15.010 --> 00:18.929
There isn't an evil bone
in Michelle Gibson's body.

00:18.929 --> 00:21.789
- Ah! The demon's here.
- Is it me?

00:21.789 --> 00:24.809
- Waverly!
- No, sweetheart. But she came for you.

00:24.809 --> 00:26.770
What would we do without you?

00:26.770 --> 00:30.009
Oh, I bet you'd all just die.
All just die.

00:31.020 --> 00:32.810
We need more rope.

00:32.810 --> 00:33.979
No!
We do not have time for this!

00:33.979 --> 00:36.990
- She's secure, Wynonna.
- Okay, one of you is gonna listen.

00:36.990 --> 00:39.759
Either one.
I don't give a shit which!!

00:39.759 --> 00:41.820
Did she steal your gun
and go full prison break on you?

00:41.820 --> 00:43.770
Go inside if you're not gonna help.

00:43.770 --> 00:45.009
No, Waverly, don't go.
Don't be alone!

00:45.009 --> 00:46.950
She has friends in the house,
Mama,

00:46.950 --> 00:48.950
who didn't try to murder her
multiple times.

00:48.950 --> 00:51.899
- No! Please, don't go.
- Go!! - No! Don't go!

00:51.899 --> 00:54.799
- Go! - Don't go!! No!
- Shut up!

00:54.799 --> 00:56.829
Waverly!!

00:56.829 --> 00:59.810
Okay, you know what? You are gonna
listen to me for two goddamn minutes.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.980
You owe me that,
no matter what you think I am.

01:02.900 --> 01:05.920
- You get one.
- Alright. Okay. Okay.

01:05.920 --> 01:08.030
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay. Okay.

01:08.030 --> 01:10.980
A demon has been stalking your
sister ever since she was a baby.

01:10.980 --> 01:14.810
By the time she was six, I knew that
it wanted to torture and kill her.

01:14.810 --> 01:16.819
And I knew that it would win.

01:16.819 --> 01:19.030
It's thoughtful of it to let you know.
Forty seconds on the clock.

01:19.030 --> 01:21.950
I was trying to exorcise it
when the barn caught fire.

01:21.950 --> 01:23.980
And instead,
it became bound to me. Okay?

01:23.980 --> 01:27.909
It has been torturing me ever since
for what I've done. It broke me.

01:27.909 --> 01:29.859
That is what you see.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.829
Our family business
is killing demons.

01:32.829 --> 01:35.799
Why wouldn't you have told us
any of that?

01:35.799 --> 01:37.870
Okay.
Because you two were children.

01:37.870 --> 01:39.990
You let Waverly
come and visit me.

01:39.990 --> 01:42.930
She touched me and
she broke the bind.

01:42.930 --> 01:44.810
The demon escaped.

01:45.789 --> 01:48.000
What, and you thought you'd join the party?
Oh!

01:48.000 --> 01:49.930
Selfish! Oh!
I could've gone anywhere,

01:49.930 --> 01:51.879
but I chose to come and save Waverly.

01:51.879 --> 01:55.760
I know I saw the demon, but where the
hell is it? Where the hell did it go?!!

01:56.849 --> 01:59.859
I know Mama's... a problem.

02:00.980 --> 02:05.830
Baby, soggy crust is a problem.
Your mama is a catastrophe.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.008
- Oh, you made cupcakes?
- Mm-hmm.

02:10.008 --> 02:12.810
For me? Aw.

02:12.810 --> 02:14.009
Mm.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.939
I'd do anything for you.

02:15.939 --> 02:17.979
All you have to do
is tell me everything.

02:19.889 --> 02:22.840
Of course. Just like always.

02:22.949 --> 02:25.889
You're family, Jolene.
Come here.

02:27.009 --> 02:29.009
Ooh! Too tight.

02:29.009 --> 02:31.870
Everything will turn out
as it should.

02:32.819 --> 02:33.840
Trust me.

02:59.780 --> 03:03.900
I just encountered the most bossy
woman itching for a drink...

03:04.770 --> 03:07.780
You think I'm a monster
for tying up my own mother.

03:08.770 --> 03:10.920
Well, I think the lineage
was immediately clear.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.039
The warden and his guards
are gonna be here any minute,

03:13.039 --> 03:15.780
and I don't know
whether to turn Mama in,

03:15.780 --> 03:17.860
or soak the barn in kerosene.

03:17.969 --> 03:21.879
She keeps saying there's a demon
who wants to kill Waverly

03:21.879 --> 03:23.969
and it's already here...

03:23.969 --> 03:29.009
Well, she did spend 20 years in a
mental institution for being... mental.

03:29.009 --> 03:32.009
Excellent point. Thank you.

03:32.009 --> 03:33.849
I beg your pardon?

03:33.849 --> 03:35.829
Oh, I...

03:35.829 --> 03:38.819
baked your fave: Snickerdoodle.

03:42.810 --> 03:45.030
- Mm. - Snickerdoodle.
- Good, right?

03:45.829 --> 03:48.920
Jolene has always made
the most superior grub.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.920
I'm also an ace lookout.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.990
Oh, you don't have to be on
demon duty, Jojo. I should do it.

03:53.990 --> 03:56.909
Oh, honey, if I let that thing
hurt any of you...

03:56.909 --> 03:59.849
No. Let me get my boots.
I'm on it.

04:12.810 --> 04:14.779
Maybe Michelle isn't lying.

04:14.779 --> 04:16.910
No, I don't think she's lying,
I think she's nuts.

04:16.910 --> 04:20.910
Officer Haught and I listened to the
therapy-session tapes from prison last night.

04:20.910 --> 04:22.930
I heard three voices.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.790
Mom, therapist...
other patient?

04:25.790 --> 04:27.850
An obscene creature,

04:27.850 --> 04:30.879
howling so violently
that it drowned out all else.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.850
The demon. The demon.

04:32.850 --> 04:35.949
The doctor couldn't hear it.
Only your mother.

04:36.899 --> 04:37.939
And then I.

04:39.769 --> 04:42.810
Why could you hear it? Did you get
extra-dimensional hearing aids?

04:47.939 --> 04:49.800
When Dolls shot me,

04:49.800 --> 04:51.750
when you were not there...

04:52.980 --> 04:55.779
Wynonna, I went to hell.

04:55.779 --> 04:58.009
- Oh, my God.
- The point is,

04:58.009 --> 05:00.959
your sister is in real danger.

05:00.959 --> 05:03.829
Look, I want to believe you.
I do. But...

05:03.829 --> 05:05.949
I didn't see a demon here
last night.

05:05.949 --> 05:08.790
All I remember
was you waving a gun at me.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.829
You were about three months old.

05:12.800 --> 05:16.029
And you were wailing your baby lungs
out, in the middle of the night,

05:16.029 --> 05:18.899
and I came in and s...

05:18.899 --> 05:21.029
something...

05:21.930 --> 05:24.930
was floating over your crib,
and I went at it

05:24.930 --> 05:26.980
with the fireplace poker,
and it left.

05:26.980 --> 05:30.810
Sometimes dreams can be like that, right?
Disorienting, when you wake up...

05:30.810 --> 05:33.909
Okay, explain why a dream started
appearing in every picture.

05:33.909 --> 05:36.949
Every photo that I took of you,
there was this face.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.860
This horror.

05:38.860 --> 05:41.759
And it was behind you
and it was blurry,

05:41.759 --> 05:44.930
but it was coming and it was
getting closer, closer every time.

05:44.930 --> 05:47.939
- Can you show me?
- No, because I got scared.

05:47.939 --> 05:51.879
And I ripped them all up, because
I thought that was gonna fix it.

05:51.879 --> 05:54.009
Jesus Christ.
Go get Wynonna out here!

05:54.009 --> 05:56.040
We're wasting time
we don't have!

06:04.920 --> 06:06.829
At kindergarten...

06:07.949 --> 06:09.889
At kindergarten, I... I wouldn't
sit next to the story-time mirror,

06:09.889 --> 06:14.889
because... because I kept
seeing something behind me.

06:15.850 --> 06:17.819
Uh... God.

06:17.819 --> 06:20.040
Teeth.
That's what I remember.

06:20.040 --> 06:23.009
Rows and rows and rows
of angry teeth.

06:23.009 --> 06:24.879
You saw it.

06:24.879 --> 06:26.779
Oh, you saw it.

06:26.949 --> 06:28.970
Hey.

06:28.970 --> 06:30.800
Oh.

06:32.009 --> 06:34.879
It's cool.
I always hated this mug.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.810
This thing hates you.

06:43.810 --> 06:46.840
It hates you more than I thought
anything could hate anyone.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.889
And I am so tired.
I'm so tired from fighting it.

06:50.889 --> 06:53.970
If something's coming...
you have me now.

06:54.899 --> 06:57.829
Wynonna. And Jolene.

06:57.829 --> 06:59.750
Who the hell's Jolene?

07:00.019 --> 07:01.959
Christ on a cracker.

07:04.889 --> 07:06.899
Pie? It's fresh out of my oven.

07:06.899 --> 07:09.970
- Morning, miss. You a neighbour?
- Sure.

07:09.970 --> 07:11.939
I'm chasin' down
an escaped felon.

07:11.939 --> 07:14.019
Oh,
I know all about your chasing.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.850
I know how many drugs you gave
the to the girls on your wing

07:21.850 --> 07:23.879
so you didn't have to chase them
too fast.

07:23.879 --> 07:27.019
I know which ones you were chasing
right into your own private office.

07:27.019 --> 07:29.829
- I'm not sure I understand.
- Thing is,

07:29.829 --> 07:31.930
it's fine with me.
Sometimes it even made me laugh.

07:31.930 --> 07:34.759
You know, the stupid
smallness of it all, of you.

07:34.759 --> 07:37.870
- Are you with the Earps?
- Yes. Finally.

07:37.870 --> 07:40.790
And sweet little Waverly's
as good as mine.

07:40.790 --> 07:43.790
It's my party and I'm not gonna
let you poop on it.

07:45.829 --> 07:48.850
You should've tried the pie.
It might've dulled the pain.

07:48.850 --> 07:51.920
Oh, well.
You're gonna be so useful.

07:57.740 --> 07:59.649
This'll be warmer.

08:04.670 --> 08:06.730
John Henry Holliday, ma'am.

08:07.550 --> 08:08.790
I'm, uh...

08:08.790 --> 08:11.629
You're an undead relic
from the Old West.

08:12.610 --> 08:14.610
Sure. Why not?

08:15.500 --> 08:17.699
He's Wynonna's... uh...

08:18.620 --> 08:20.600
"Uh..." mean boyfriend?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.569
- Oh, boy.
- I don't like to presume.

08:22.569 --> 08:25.519
Like, a century-plus. Oh, but
Waverly's shtupping a cop.

08:25.519 --> 08:26.629
Her name's Nicole.

08:29.529 --> 08:33.590
Whoa. I'd love to talk...
about her later. If we live.

08:34.659 --> 08:38.509
You're gonna love her. Almost as
much as we love you, Mama Earp.

08:38.620 --> 08:40.600
Hey, what's all over your apron?

08:40.600 --> 08:43.529
Oh, it's chocolate.
Bit of a cream-puff disaster.

08:43.529 --> 08:46.679
Don't you...
remember me, Michelle?

08:47.759 --> 08:51.509
- You... you smell familiar.
- Mm.

08:51.669 --> 08:52.659
Mama!

08:53.629 --> 08:56.779
This is Jolene.
My friend since... forever?

08:56.779 --> 08:59.629
Oh, Mama hasn't been here
since forever.

08:59.629 --> 09:01.509
No, she abandoned, uh...
No, wait. I... I didn't.

09:03.539 --> 09:06.759
She left... three young girls
alone with their alcoholic father.

09:06.759 --> 09:09.629
Oh, no, no, that was because of the demon.
Mm.

09:09.629 --> 09:10.759
Mm-hmm.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.789
Jolene, we don't have time
to talk about this right now.

09:13.789 --> 09:17.659
It's coming. It's strong.
And all it wants is Waverly.

09:17.659 --> 09:20.639
Oh, well, the road is pretty
clear.

09:20.639 --> 09:22.669
I think the danger has passed.

09:22.669 --> 09:25.620
The Gibson greenhouse, the family
farm it's where Waverly was born.

09:25.620 --> 09:29.610
I'm gonna summon it.
I'll bind it to me. Again.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.620
I'll see you
out at the Gibson place.

09:41.789 --> 09:44.620
Oh, I have so much baking to do,

09:44.620 --> 09:47.549
I'm not going,
and you shouldn't go either.

09:47.549 --> 09:50.639
Well... if the Earps
need my pistol, I'll be there.

09:50.639 --> 09:54.549
This family reunion is...
really charged.

09:54.779 --> 09:57.519
I'll keep my counsel.

09:57.519 --> 09:59.740
Wynonna can't waste her energy
feeling badly for you

09:59.740 --> 10:04.500
because of the thing about you
going to H-E-Double-Hockey-Sticks.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.649
She told you about that?

10:07.500 --> 10:10.649
Yeah, well, I do not require anyone's
pity, least of all Wynonna Earp's.

10:10.649 --> 10:12.529
She's too nice
to say any of this,

10:12.529 --> 10:14.789
but Nona's got a whack-jack mama
and a bad-ass demon on her plate.

10:14.789 --> 10:18.629
I mean, does she really need a
mortal bartender with half a lung

10:18.629 --> 10:21.500
and a probable mood disorder
dragging her down?

10:21.730 --> 10:23.710
Well,
that is somewhat reductive.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.690
I just wonder
how useful you are, you know.

10:26.690 --> 10:29.649
I mean, what have you brought
to the table lately?

10:29.649 --> 10:31.730
I don't mean any offence
by this.

10:31.730 --> 10:33.750
But have I ever lied to you?

10:34.789 --> 10:38.639
- No, I don't recall that you have.
- No.

10:43.539 --> 10:45.700
Men are so much easier.

10:46.590 --> 10:48.570
I just wish I was there

10:48.570 --> 10:51.570
to keep that darn Waverly
from doing something stupid.

10:51.570 --> 10:53.740
Well...
we can't perform miracles,

10:53.740 --> 10:56.620
but I... do my best.

11:01.679 --> 11:04.710
Yeah, you could have
a really sweet grow-op in here.

11:04.710 --> 11:07.710
Okay, good... There's a door here and...
those doors there.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.750
And there's a skylight,
this one.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.740
It could be an entry point.

11:11.740 --> 11:14.669
- Mama, can we talk?
- Sorry. Ain't that what we've been doin'?

11:14.669 --> 11:16.590
About my real dad.

11:22.620 --> 11:24.750
His... his name was Julian.

11:27.710 --> 11:29.529
Who was he?

11:31.710 --> 11:33.590
He was someone better.

11:36.629 --> 11:39.500
I ran here
every time I could escape.

11:40.509 --> 11:42.590
And somehow he knew
how to follow.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.539
Where is he?

11:48.679 --> 11:49.740
Where did he go?

11:51.779 --> 11:55.600
Later. None of it's gonna matter
if we can't save his daughter.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.600
Licence and registration?

12:30.539 --> 12:32.629
And a permit
for your cherry light?

12:32.629 --> 12:35.600
Nikki! I was trying to get these
to you while they were still warm.

12:35.690 --> 12:38.539
- Lemon scones?
- No poppy seeds.

12:38.539 --> 12:41.620
I know you hate them.
Days of flossing, am I right?

12:46.549 --> 12:47.740
You...

12:47.740 --> 12:50.740
you know all of my weaknesses,
Jolene.

12:51.610 --> 12:55.500
After you, I'm gonna drop off some
fortifying treats to the Earp ladies.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.529
- Mm. The homestead?
- Oh, no, no.

12:57.529 --> 12:59.659
They're off on some
typically nutty mission -

12:59.659 --> 13:01.720
Wavy, Nona,
and their fugitive mamacita.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.500
Oh, am I just dropping
all of this on you?

13:06.500 --> 13:08.549
I thought Waves
would've at least texted.

13:08.549 --> 13:10.779
It's, uh, not something
they always think of.

13:10.779 --> 13:13.509
Including you in their plans?

13:14.620 --> 13:16.629
Speaking of plans,
I do have to get going.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.669
I need your girlfriend
to finish all of this.

13:18.669 --> 13:20.720
I would do it myself,
but, of course,

13:20.720 --> 13:22.620
I can't physically harm her
and...

13:22.620 --> 13:24.570
What?

13:24.570 --> 13:27.639
Oh, don't worry, doesn't mean
we can't have some fun first.

13:28.570 --> 13:30.610
That's it, eat up.
Mm.

13:30.610 --> 13:31.789
Oh!
There's a little crumb there.

13:33.679 --> 13:35.649
Mm.
Ah... Jolene?

13:35.649 --> 13:37.620
- Mm-hmm.
- You're free to go.

13:37.620 --> 13:40.750
You tell Waverly and those
Earp bitches I said "hey".

13:41.570 --> 13:42.730
Wait, did I just say...?

13:43.740 --> 13:47.500
Oh, that's right.
"Bitches" is dead-on.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.529
You just missed one.

14:00.679 --> 14:02.639
If you stand here,
you can cover me.

14:04.629 --> 14:06.659
Wait. Where's Mama?

14:06.659 --> 14:09.570
On top of everything else, we need
to be an adult daycare centre?!

14:09.570 --> 14:12.659
I'm outside! We've
gotta get the sonofabitch here!

14:12.659 --> 14:15.580
Ah!!

14:16.539 --> 14:19.509
Ah!! Wah-ah!!

14:19.710 --> 14:22.759
First in barrel racing,
but the second act was roping.

14:22.759 --> 14:25.509
- Argh!
- Back off, demon.

14:25.509 --> 14:28.529
- I thought you cut off his head.
- It grew back, ugly revenant stylez.

14:28.529 --> 14:31.570
But this time, I brought the deal-breaker.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.529
Make your peace.

14:33.529 --> 14:36.570
Through mime, if necessary.

14:39.639 --> 14:43.610
Oh, my God. We did it.
We did... we did it.

14:43.610 --> 14:45.769
We did it! Oh!

14:48.730 --> 14:50.759
He'll never hurt us again, Mama.

14:52.679 --> 14:54.659
Oh. Oh, my God.

14:55.690 --> 14:57.769
He's gone.

14:57.769 --> 15:02.669
Christ, I almost didn't think I was
gonna get here without me being dead.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.529
Waverly...

15:06.590 --> 15:07.769
Waverly...

15:15.779 --> 15:17.549
Jolene.

15:18.779 --> 15:20.620
What are you doing here?

15:20.620 --> 15:23.519
Your mother set a trap for me.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.789
You can't make this easy,
can you?

15:34.789 --> 15:38.730
You selfish, greedy tumour.

15:39.529 --> 15:42.549
You have taken everything
from me.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.789
But you are gonna pay it back!

15:44.789 --> 15:48.789
You'll have to do it yourself,
but we can make that happen.

15:53.629 --> 15:54.740
Oh!

15:58.629 --> 15:59.769
Wynonna!

16:00.580 --> 16:01.639
Mama!

16:01.639 --> 16:03.590
Jolene?

16:03.590 --> 16:04.740
Oh, Jolene!

16:04.740 --> 16:06.639
Oh, God. Are you okay?!

16:06.639 --> 16:09.690
- I... I just came to bring a picnic.
- Oh!

16:10.539 --> 16:11.690
She grabbed me.

16:11.690 --> 16:13.759
Don't be mad at her.
She's confused,

16:13.759 --> 16:16.549
and we're all
under so much stress.

16:16.549 --> 16:18.679
Waverly,
what the hell is wrong with you?

16:20.610 --> 16:21.740
I...

16:23.664 --> 16:26.455
- To whisky!
- Whoo!

16:27.524 --> 16:29.495
Mm! Ah...

16:29.495 --> 16:31.424
God, I've missed her.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.565
Oh! Oh, and to Jolene!

16:33.565 --> 16:36.504
- Oh, that sexy bitch.
- Madam.

16:36.504 --> 16:38.504
You gonna charge
for those cookies?

16:38.504 --> 16:40.455
It's a tasty way
to make friends.

16:40.455 --> 16:41.565
Yeah, so's showing
your cleavage,

16:41.565 --> 16:44.434
and you don't have to do
the dishes after.

16:44.434 --> 16:46.394
- Hey-oh!
- Hey. Ho-ho.

16:47.634 --> 16:50.455
- Hi.
- Oh.

16:50.455 --> 16:52.565
"Hi." Don't be like that.

16:52.565 --> 16:54.565
What?
I'm not being like anything.

16:54.565 --> 16:57.634
Well, then take a shot and
don't forget the cardinal rule.

16:57.634 --> 16:59.565
Don't drink wine after whiskey?

16:59.565 --> 17:01.634
Nope.
The cardinal cardinal rule.

17:01.634 --> 17:05.394
Don't attack members
of your own team, dorkus.

17:05.634 --> 17:06.634
Duh.

17:10.505 --> 17:13.515
You sure they want me to come?
They still seem so mad.

17:13.515 --> 17:15.644
Oh, they'll be fine, sugar-cube.

17:15.644 --> 17:18.404
Will you?

17:18.404 --> 17:20.515
Look, I am so sorry, Jolene.

17:20.515 --> 17:23.644
I mean, I... I saw something...
I don't know...

17:23.644 --> 17:26.664
Look, we all know that
you're a little trigger-happy.

17:26.664 --> 17:28.575
Nicole calls it impulsive.

17:28.575 --> 17:30.515
- She said that?
- Mm-hmm.

17:30.515 --> 17:32.474
She's meeting us at Shorty's.

17:32.615 --> 17:35.575
What? You called her?!

17:35.575 --> 17:39.375
She's my best friend, Waverly.

17:39.375 --> 17:40.555
Cupcake for the road?

17:41.625 --> 17:43.414
Thanks.

17:51.525 --> 17:54.484
Oh, Gypsy Rose Lestat seems to
have made herself right at home.

17:54.484 --> 17:56.414
Maybe I should get
my fortune told,

17:56.414 --> 17:58.525
'cause my future
feels wide open!

17:58.525 --> 18:02.585
No! Look, all our cash is earmarked
for the Get-Mama-Pissed-fund.

18:02.585 --> 18:05.575
- Three more, barkeep.
- Comin' right up. - Yes, please.

18:09.375 --> 18:10.605
Nice.

18:11.474 --> 18:13.484
Something I don't understand.

18:13.484 --> 18:15.634
How can a revenant
be inside my head all this time,

18:15.634 --> 18:18.575
but physically in the prison?
It doesn't add up.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.565
Would you like a Nanaimo bar?

18:21.484 --> 18:23.454
Need max room for max beer.

18:23.454 --> 18:24.664
- Mm.
- Or whisky.

18:26.595 --> 18:28.644
Some revenants have different powers.

18:28.644 --> 18:31.444
Though that's a new one.
A big one.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.464
Yeah, it doesn't feel right.
At all.

18:33.464 --> 18:35.585
- No.
- You know what else doesn't feel right?

18:35.585 --> 18:39.605
Just Kate thinking she can set up shop in
our bar just because she's Doc's wife.

18:39.605 --> 18:41.444
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

18:41.444 --> 18:42.644
She's his old lady
from the Old West.

18:42.644 --> 18:45.545
Typical Romeo and Juliet stuff.

18:48.565 --> 18:49.515
Whoa.

18:53.494 --> 18:56.565
- I'll go talk to her.
- Yeah, I'm gonna drink for her.

19:11.434 --> 19:13.654
- Who is that?
- You are still coherent.

19:13.654 --> 19:16.384
An act of will, Doc.

19:17.384 --> 19:20.565
Xavier Dolls... is dead.

19:20.565 --> 19:22.434
Interesting.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.394
Were you friends at the end?

19:27.394 --> 19:28.565
I'd like to think so.

19:28.565 --> 19:32.434
That ain't why you came here,
to ply me with...

19:35.434 --> 19:37.384
banana liqueur?

19:37.384 --> 19:40.494
Well, feel free to send it
back up if you are declining.

19:40.494 --> 19:44.494
I'll just plug my
nose and pretend I'm in Tahiti.

19:45.494 --> 19:46.565
Oh, hello.

19:46.565 --> 19:48.555
What do you want from me, Doc?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.434
Tears? Shock?

19:50.434 --> 19:52.454
I'm looking for an angle...

19:52.575 --> 19:55.404
I can use on Bulshar.

19:55.404 --> 19:57.595
You know better
than to make deals with devils.

19:57.595 --> 20:00.505
A lesson we have both been slow
to learn.

20:00.505 --> 20:03.444
I... want to negotiate!

20:03.444 --> 20:06.404
I... want a visitor.

20:06.404 --> 20:07.625
Waverly Earp.

20:09.595 --> 20:11.545
I will do my level best.

20:11.545 --> 20:13.595
Bulshar wants his ring.

20:13.595 --> 20:18.474
It was on his hand when it got cut
off by his spider wife, the widow.

20:18.474 --> 20:19.654
What does it do?

20:19.654 --> 20:22.444
It makes his finger
look really pretty.

20:22.444 --> 20:26.384
Well, I have not seen it
since we ended her.

20:26.384 --> 20:28.454
Your little team of heroes.

20:28.454 --> 20:30.535
One of them must've jacked it.

20:31.484 --> 20:33.525
And they haven't told you
they have it yet.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.555
Enjoy the belly-wash.

20:35.555 --> 20:39.515
Sorry you'll have to stand
in your own piss afterwards.

20:42.454 --> 20:45.384
Send me Waverly!
You owe me, Doc!

20:45.384 --> 20:47.434
Send me Waverly!

20:47.434 --> 20:48.634
Obviously, I assumed

20:48.634 --> 20:51.515
she was mega-dead by now,
nothing but a body.

20:51.515 --> 20:52.575
But what a body.

20:52.575 --> 20:56.414
That's Big Nose Kate?!
Her nose is perfect.

20:56.414 --> 20:58.555
Well, in better news,
she has to go around

20:58.555 --> 21:01.414
with that nickname now
for the rest of eternity.

21:01.414 --> 21:04.644
You are Wynonna Earp. Now get your
butt out here and I will do repairs.

21:04.644 --> 21:07.384
What repairs?

21:07.384 --> 21:09.565
I don't need repairs.
Oh, honey.

21:12.644 --> 21:15.394
- Oh, good call.
- Mm-hmm.

21:20.535 --> 21:22.644
Hey. Are you okay?

21:22.644 --> 21:26.535
See, Waverly gets it. She's the one
that told me that Kate was his wife.

21:27.414 --> 21:28.585
You knew?!

21:28.585 --> 21:31.644
Well...
it was Doc's right to tell...

21:31.644 --> 21:34.605
I didn't think I should.
Be loyal? Yeah.

21:36.525 --> 21:40.424
Look, Wynonna, Kate came
for him, not vice versa.

21:40.424 --> 21:44.595
Now, you shove those legendary Earp ta-tas
up and you go and you tantalize that man.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.625
I don't think
that's a good idea.

21:46.625 --> 21:51.394
So you can't not be on Wynonna's
side and then tell her how to behave.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.424
Well...
since when do we have sides?

21:53.424 --> 21:56.555
I dunno, but you sure as hell don't
seem to be on mine, half-sister.

22:04.484 --> 22:06.535
Why did I just say that?
That was awful.

22:06.535 --> 22:08.404
Oh, I don't think so, hon.

22:08.404 --> 22:10.595
I think that's exactly
what she needed to hear.

22:24.634 --> 22:27.474
I should have some staff
here somewhere.

22:27.474 --> 22:28.494
Mm.

22:29.474 --> 22:33.394
Y'know, I thought I liked you,
Johnny Hank.

22:33.394 --> 22:34.644
Classic cowboy...

22:35.605 --> 22:38.555
bar full of bottles
that turns my crank.

22:38.555 --> 22:39.625
Here.

22:41.605 --> 22:43.555
But...

22:45.414 --> 22:46.575
Oh, what is this?

22:46.575 --> 22:50.654
I call it...
the Don't Have A Stealth Wife

22:50.654 --> 22:53.555
While You're Doin' My Daughter
You Enormous Prick!

23:04.575 --> 23:07.375
Oh, it is a pitiful evening indeed.

23:07.375 --> 23:09.615
I cannot even catch the eye
of Jolene,

23:09.615 --> 23:11.625
the prettiest girl in Purgatory.

23:15.625 --> 23:17.535
I don't like you at all.

23:17.535 --> 23:19.484
I didn't even mean that.

23:28.384 --> 23:30.384
Nicky.
Hey. You made it.

23:30.384 --> 23:33.394
Can I get you a drink?
Oh, yes, please.

23:34.505 --> 23:38.414
No, I-I won't go see him.
We can't open that door. Can we?

23:38.414 --> 23:42.454
- Well, he did say it was to your own advantage.
- Excuse me?

23:42.654 --> 23:46.484
I know you two aren't talking about
Bobo Del Rey without me, right?

23:46.484 --> 23:49.654
Oh, I'm just... trying to find a way to, uh, contribute.
- Doc.

23:49.654 --> 23:53.424
'Cause I feel like you've been
contributing all over the place!

23:53.424 --> 23:57.444
Wynonna...
- It seems you are incapable of keeping a confidence.

23:57.444 --> 23:58.555
- You're married!
- Guys...

23:58.555 --> 23:59.654
- Shut up, Waverly!
- Shut up!!

24:01.464 --> 24:04.525
Pardon the interruption, but I heard
someone wished to cross my palm?

24:04.525 --> 24:07.664
Ha-ha. Is that what they're
calling it these days?

24:07.664 --> 24:10.494
Didn't think your palm
was necessarily involved.

24:10.494 --> 24:13.525
- Maybe this isn't the best time.
- Hey, Waverly...

24:13.525 --> 24:15.505
maybe mow your own lawn.

24:16.625 --> 24:18.525
Oh, oh.

24:21.474 --> 24:23.644
Well, it's all in the smile and wave.

24:23.644 --> 24:25.605
Oh, it's quite a smile.

24:25.605 --> 24:27.644
Here, let me grab that for you.

24:27.644 --> 24:30.454
What are you doing?

24:30.454 --> 24:32.535
Uh, I just, uh, got here.

24:32.535 --> 24:34.625
- We're having a brilliant time.
- Ah!!

24:34.625 --> 24:37.484
Whoa! Okay, Waverly.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

24:37.484 --> 24:39.545
- Hey!
- No, just give me a second!

24:39.545 --> 24:42.414
Okay.
She's just pouring me a beer!

24:43.384 --> 24:45.444
Okay, whoa, guys.
Just take it easy, alright?

24:45.444 --> 24:48.394
- Let's not move, copper.
- Get off of her!

24:50.375 --> 24:52.545
Yeah! Alright!

24:52.545 --> 24:55.545
- Nice, Mama.
- Wah! Oh!

24:55.545 --> 24:57.644
This one goes out to chaos.

25:06.384 --> 25:08.414
Whoo!!

25:08.414 --> 25:10.484
- Mama, get down!
- Hey, get off!

25:10.484 --> 25:12.454
- Come on down.
- Hey!

25:12.454 --> 25:15.505
Whoo!
First call for free alcohol!

25:15.505 --> 25:17.535
Oh, yeah!

25:17.535 --> 25:20.654
Whoa!!

25:20.654 --> 25:23.454
Mama!

25:23.454 --> 25:25.555
You're back for one day
and then you got...

25:27.654 --> 25:30.434
- You're cut off!
- You're my kid! You don't turn off my taps!

25:30.434 --> 25:33.595
- Don't tell her what to do!
- Hey! I can fight my own battles!

25:33.595 --> 25:36.525
Yeah? When are you...
gonna start, huh?

25:36.525 --> 25:38.525
Ah!

25:40.625 --> 25:43.525
Goddammit, Wynonna,
can't you be sober for once?!

25:43.525 --> 25:47.595
Yeah? Can you be a not-stuck-up...
suck-up?!

25:50.525 --> 25:53.464
I pursued that man over continents
and centuries and I do not give up!

25:53.464 --> 25:55.414
Blah, bitch.
Have you met me?

25:55.414 --> 25:57.394
Excuse me.

25:57.394 --> 26:00.394
Whoa!

26:04.744 --> 26:06.865
Ok, move! In you go...

26:09.865 --> 26:12.694
Just try not to hit each other, okay?
Or do.

26:12.694 --> 26:13.845
You punched everybody else
in town.

26:13.845 --> 26:16.664
I got the mutton-chop dude
and I got the...

26:16.664 --> 26:17.865
I got that vampire whore...

26:17.865 --> 26:21.775
And I got the ginger cop.
I'm sorry. And Doc...

26:21.775 --> 26:24.684
- And Doc.
- Jinx! You owe me a beer!

26:26.914 --> 26:29.734
You know, Jolene sent you guys
some baking,

26:29.734 --> 26:33.644
but I'm just gonna give it to the staff
for having to deal with the two of you!

26:33.644 --> 26:34.795
Boo...!

26:34.795 --> 26:37.654
It was lovely
to meet you, Officer.

26:37.654 --> 26:39.805
- Was it?
- Meh.

26:39.894 --> 26:42.845
- If they give you any trouble...
- They're Earps.

26:42.845 --> 26:45.744
- Yeah. Call me first. Right?
- Mm.

26:45.875 --> 26:47.674
Ahem.

26:52.664 --> 26:53.694
Hi.

26:54.694 --> 26:56.855
- Okay.
- Oh, I-I...

26:57.785 --> 26:59.694
just came to bail them out.

26:59.694 --> 27:02.835
Well, no bail for drunks.
They stay until they're not.

27:02.835 --> 27:05.625
Oh, well, then see you next week.

27:06.664 --> 27:10.795
Even though Wynonna did assault an
officer, I'm not gonna press charges.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.855
But Michelle? We've gotta
turn her in to the feds.

27:13.855 --> 27:16.644
- What? Nicole! No.
- Harbouring a fugitive at your home,

27:16.644 --> 27:19.755
one who tried to kill you as a child?!
What were you thinking?!

27:19.755 --> 27:21.664
- She's my mother!
- And I'm a cop!

27:21.664 --> 27:23.805
You didn't think
to talk to me about it first?!

27:25.904 --> 27:29.785
Uh, I was... I was going to.

27:29.785 --> 27:32.775
Hmm. But you didn't.
I had to hear it from Jolene.

27:32.775 --> 27:34.734
Were you not even thinking
about me at all?

27:34.734 --> 27:37.654
Am I always the last person
you consider?!

27:37.654 --> 27:38.785
No. I...

27:40.634 --> 27:42.634
I'm so sorry. I...

27:46.914 --> 27:49.734
Can I call you later?
Yeah, or don't.

27:52.825 --> 27:55.734
Like a queen surveying her kingdom.

27:57.765 --> 28:01.664
- Sorry?
- No, I don't believe you are.

28:01.664 --> 28:03.795
I'm bored. Want a freebie?

28:03.795 --> 28:06.755
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm not interested.

28:08.914 --> 28:12.714
Five of Wands.
This is a warning.

28:12.714 --> 28:14.644
You have an outstanding bill.

28:15.625 --> 28:17.625
I'm all paid up.
Just ask your hubby.

28:17.625 --> 28:19.734
You owe fealty.
And if you were my friend,

28:19.734 --> 28:23.865
I'd tell you to pay that debt, for he
knows what you've done. He is coming.

28:23.865 --> 28:25.775
You know,
the thing with vampires is,

28:25.775 --> 28:27.855
you all think
you're the life of the party,

28:27.855 --> 28:32.644
but actually you're all a bunch
of high-maintenance, whiny-ass,

28:32.644 --> 28:34.775
dirt-stinking blood-sucking
buzz-kills.

28:34.775 --> 28:37.714
Oh, and your lipstick's
always kind of janky

28:37.714 --> 28:39.825
'cause of your weird
oral fixation.

28:45.664 --> 28:46.884
Jolene.

28:49.884 --> 28:52.654
Waverly? Waverly.

28:52.884 --> 28:54.845
Hey.

28:54.845 --> 28:56.825
Karaoke night!

28:56.825 --> 28:58.884
Is your bar totally busted?

28:58.884 --> 29:00.805
Oh, no thanks to you.

29:02.634 --> 29:06.654
You know anything about a ring?
A ring that may have been Bulshar's?

29:06.825 --> 29:08.755
Uh, Nicole does.

29:10.634 --> 29:11.884
Alright, I will bite.

29:13.634 --> 29:15.734
Why, pray tell, are you crying?

29:15.734 --> 29:16.904
Again.

29:18.775 --> 29:20.904
Because everything? I...

29:20.904 --> 29:24.825
I think Nicole just dumped me and I don't
guess what? I don't even blame her.

29:24.825 --> 29:26.805
I... I yelled at Wynonna.

29:26.805 --> 29:30.724
Mama's going back to jail and I
feel like it's all my fault.

29:31.644 --> 29:34.674
She said the demon came
when I was born.

29:34.674 --> 29:35.865
When you were born.

29:36.775 --> 29:37.845
Wait.

29:39.765 --> 29:42.865
Are you saying...
The demon.

29:43.795 --> 29:45.694
Is it me?

29:55.634 --> 29:57.684
You know, it would make sense.

29:57.684 --> 30:00.904
You're not the same as the rest of 'em.
Bobo said you were his kin.

30:00.904 --> 30:05.625
Plus - oof -
you got a real vicious streak.

30:05.845 --> 30:07.734
Just ask Jolene.

30:09.845 --> 30:11.714
Hello, beautiful.

30:11.714 --> 30:13.714
I'm just waiting for Waverly.

30:13.714 --> 30:17.805
We got into this huge fight. I don't even
know why I said half the things that I said.

30:17.805 --> 30:19.755
I see you.

30:19.755 --> 30:22.674
You spend your life
rescuing others.

30:23.714 --> 30:25.644
What about you?

30:25.644 --> 30:26.815
Oh, what are you doing?

30:27.654 --> 30:28.904
Whatever I want.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.755
Are you... even gay?

30:34.755 --> 30:36.865
I'm whatever you want me to be.

30:37.724 --> 30:39.704
And everything that she's not.

30:39.884 --> 30:41.714
I love Waverly.

30:41.714 --> 30:43.894
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do. I love her.

30:43.894 --> 30:47.904
And you, I don't even...
I don't even think I like you.

30:49.664 --> 30:51.785
Cagnia mortuus!

30:54.674 --> 30:57.755
Impossible. I threw this away
into the woods.

30:57.755 --> 30:59.875
Ah!! Oh!

31:01.734 --> 31:02.875
What is that?

31:02.875 --> 31:04.775
It's Bulshar's ring.

31:04.775 --> 31:06.684
He is risen.

31:14.894 --> 31:19.704
- Ma, are you awake?
- Oh, my, God, I wish I wasn't.

31:19.704 --> 31:21.734
I'm sorry...

31:21.734 --> 31:24.694
about the mean stuff
I said before.

31:25.805 --> 31:27.904
For thinking
you were an asshole...

31:27.904 --> 31:32.644
the whole time you were...
sacrificing everything for us.

31:32.815 --> 31:35.674
Well, I'll tell you what I did.
I was a mom.

31:35.674 --> 31:36.865
And you'd have done
the same thing.

31:36.865 --> 31:38.765
I did.

31:38.765 --> 31:40.654
My little girl.

31:41.875 --> 31:43.744
Alice Michelle.

31:43.744 --> 31:45.825
Alice Michelle?

31:46.634 --> 31:49.634
I sent her away
until this curse is gone.

31:49.634 --> 31:51.664
Sounds like you made
the right choice.

31:51.815 --> 31:54.835
- Feels like... shitty shit.
- Hey, she's lucky.

31:57.634 --> 32:00.714
Can you imagine...
You and me...

32:00.714 --> 32:02.684
Toasted on schnapps

32:02.684 --> 32:04.795
at the back
of the school nativity play,

32:04.795 --> 32:06.714
going: "Whoo-hoo!!

32:06.714 --> 32:10.714
Hey, you're one hot Virgin Mary,
Earp!"

32:13.825 --> 32:15.664
I just...

32:15.875 --> 32:18.664
still can't figure out...

32:19.724 --> 32:21.845
why a demon died
like a revenant.

32:21.845 --> 32:22.815
Hmm.

32:25.674 --> 32:28.734
My head feels different.
It feels wrong.

32:30.684 --> 32:33.785
Oh, how does Jolene know
that I love Nanaimo bars?

32:33.785 --> 32:35.875
Maybe it's just the whisky
passing through?

32:38.894 --> 32:42.724
No, I feel it. I think
the demon's still out there.

32:45.654 --> 32:47.704
So's my baby sister.

33:01.664 --> 33:06.294
Ah, if it isn't the demon...
Waverly.

33:11.029 --> 33:14.279
Hey 911! 911!
Randy! Get your khaki ass in here!

33:14.279 --> 33:18.019
I saw your name on the board, Michelle
Gibson, and I did not believe it.

33:18.019 --> 33:22.150
You don't recognize these dulcet tones?
Hi, Randy. Now let me the hell out.

33:22.150 --> 33:25.140
You know, on top of you two being
in here for public intoxication,

33:25.140 --> 33:27.210
there's a state warrant
out for your arrest.

33:27.210 --> 33:31.150
Yes, there's also a bastard demon out
there trying to kill Waverly right now!

33:31.150 --> 33:33.160
Michelle, let's not go back
to the crazy talk

33:33.160 --> 33:35.130
like that night
you burned down the barn.

33:35.130 --> 33:37.250
- Nedley! She's telling the truth.
- So let me out. Now.

33:37.250 --> 33:40.130
- There's only Jolene to look after her.
- Who's Jolene?

33:40.130 --> 33:44.250
- Jolene. You know. We grew up with her.
- Last name? Which family?

33:45.160 --> 33:47.230
- I dunno.
- Did they live in town?

33:47.230 --> 33:50.240
Which concession? You got a phone number?
Everybody's got a phone number.

33:50.240 --> 33:51.220
Demons don't.

33:53.049 --> 33:56.099
Also, do you know who brought in the
baking? I could use some breakfast.

33:56.099 --> 33:58.130
Put down that tart,
Randy!!

34:00.250 --> 34:02.099
You're not good.

34:03.059 --> 34:05.000
If you were good...

34:05.179 --> 34:09.230
you wouldn't have lost...
everything.

34:13.289 --> 34:17.079
Are you going to do
something right...

34:17.260 --> 34:19.210
for once?!

34:20.260 --> 34:24.030
My mom would never say this,
but she did all this to...

34:24.260 --> 34:29.139
to protect me from...
from the dark thing.

34:32.130 --> 34:35.230
You... are the dark thing.

34:38.018 --> 34:40.179
The real baby was special,

34:40.179 --> 34:42.210
but you're not her.

34:43.199 --> 34:45.170
You're a changeling,

34:45.170 --> 34:49.030
the evil that she left behind

34:49.030 --> 34:53.110
that night in the burning barn.

34:53.110 --> 34:55.079
My father was a demon.

34:55.079 --> 34:57.119
You know he is.

34:59.139 --> 35:02.159
You can't cheerlead your way
out of this one.

35:09.230 --> 35:11.219
It's too much.

35:13.030 --> 35:14.280
Then do it!

35:16.139 --> 35:17.280
End it!

35:18.079 --> 35:21.269
It's the only thing
that will make it better!

35:29.119 --> 35:30.260
Do it.

35:31.250 --> 35:33.119
Waverly!!

35:33.119 --> 35:35.199
Officer Haught!
Are you in here?!

35:35.199 --> 35:37.130
Waverly!

35:40.050 --> 35:41.070
Waverly!

35:41.070 --> 35:43.210
- What about her?
- Jolene's the demon.

35:44.019 --> 35:47.019
I was born at the exact
same time as you.

35:48.090 --> 35:49.130
Twins?

35:50.039 --> 35:51.260
In a sick sense.

35:51.260 --> 35:53.289
The universe craves balance.

35:54.280 --> 35:58.179
And you came and arrived
out of the light,

35:58.179 --> 36:00.099
and I...

36:00.099 --> 36:02.289
I crawled out of the muck.

36:03.159 --> 36:06.050
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

36:06.050 --> 36:09.070
Everything good
was given to you.

36:10.150 --> 36:14.239
Freedom, flaxen hair, family.

36:16.130 --> 36:18.139
And what did I get?

36:18.139 --> 36:20.099
I got shunned,

36:20.099 --> 36:23.030
starved... reviled!

36:23.030 --> 36:24.230
Oh...

36:24.230 --> 36:26.170
But we're equals now.

36:27.159 --> 36:30.280
Because nobody loves you either.

36:35.059 --> 36:36.280
Why don't you do it?

36:36.280 --> 36:41.119
Haven't you been listening?!
We're linked, you idiot!!!

36:43.110 --> 36:47.079
Do it,
you useless piece of skin.

36:49.059 --> 36:50.190
Wynonna!

36:51.239 --> 36:53.130
Wynonna loves me.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.050
- No.
- Yes. Yes. Always.

36:57.050 --> 36:59.170
And... and despite
what happened tonight,

36:59.170 --> 37:02.039
I know...
I know that Nicole does too.

37:02.039 --> 37:05.070
And... and... and Doc and...

37:05.070 --> 37:06.250
Jeremy and...

37:06.250 --> 37:08.170
oh, Mama.

37:08.170 --> 37:10.269
- You're lying to yourself.
- No.

37:10.269 --> 37:13.119
You don't bring them
a single thing!

37:13.119 --> 37:14.280
I'm here.

37:14.280 --> 37:17.139
I'm here and I stay...

37:18.179 --> 37:21.079
And I love them back and...

37:22.110 --> 37:25.030
And I... I never, never,

37:25.030 --> 37:27.260
never give up on them.

37:28.250 --> 37:31.019
Ah!

37:34.179 --> 37:36.099
It's my birthright.

37:36.099 --> 37:38.239
Ah! Ah!

37:38.239 --> 37:40.219
Well, this is mine!

37:43.260 --> 37:45.170
I can still fix this.

37:45.170 --> 37:48.110
This is for Nicole.

37:48.230 --> 37:52.239
And this is for making me feel
worthless! Ah!

37:52.239 --> 37:57.030
- You can't kill me without killing yourself!
- But she can.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.159
Oh!

38:03.090 --> 38:04.269
I'm your friend.

38:06.159 --> 38:08.000
You love me.

38:08.280 --> 38:11.039
- I love her more.
- Oh.

38:17.170 --> 38:20.159
Goddamn Earps.

38:25.059 --> 38:27.159
Hey. Hey, hey.

38:28.199 --> 38:30.210
Don't let the bitch get away.

38:37.090 --> 38:39.019
You slag!

38:39.019 --> 38:41.050
What are you doing?

38:41.050 --> 38:44.210
Something I dreamed about every
time you kept me awake in my cell,

38:44.210 --> 38:47.119
whispering what you were gonna
do to my daughter!

38:51.000 --> 38:52.170
What is that?

38:53.150 --> 38:55.050
- It's him.
- No.

38:56.099 --> 39:01.130
That was fealty.
I swear... the girl was for you.

39:03.090 --> 39:06.000
Ah! Ah! Ah!

39:06.000 --> 39:08.230
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

39:08.230 --> 39:10.050
Ah...!

39:14.280 --> 39:16.119
Bulshar!

39:17.050 --> 39:18.130
Oh!

39:27.110 --> 39:29.050
Come on, girls.

39:29.050 --> 39:31.059
Oh, let's go home.

39:31.569 --> 39:36.750
Even though your were in the thrall if a powerful super
evil demon and her unearthly baked goods, you said.

39:36.769 --> 39:38.860
I said...

39:38.860 --> 39:43.800
that you are the only luscious,
funny...

39:43.800 --> 39:45.750
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:45.750 --> 39:48.800
Hot-as-hell baby that I need.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.860
Then she got super pissed
and threw me into the dresser,

39:50.860 --> 39:52.980
and... that's when
the ring fell.

39:52.980 --> 39:55.000
- Then it burned her?
- Yeah.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.760
And then she got even more pissed
and tossed me into the closet.

39:59.760 --> 40:00.909
Ironically.

40:00.909 --> 40:03.909
- Ugh.
- Hey, hey, she's gone now.

40:03.909 --> 40:05.889
That's what's important, right?

40:06.809 --> 40:09.960
Right. But the ring coming
back to you, that's...

40:09.960 --> 40:13.010
- Yeah, kind of a creepy boomerang vibe.
- Yeah...

40:13.010 --> 40:16.000
But it kept you safe from her.

40:17.809 --> 40:21.960
I'm sorry. Sometimes things are...
are so completely nuts,

40:21.960 --> 40:23.869
and you, you...

40:23.869 --> 40:27.829
well, you seem okay
and sane and safe.

40:27.969 --> 40:30.880
So I forget to give you
the completely-nuts update.

40:30.880 --> 40:34.019
Yeah, you know what? How about you
just, uh, update me later, 'kay?

40:41.949 --> 40:43.920
Bulshar!

40:43.920 --> 40:46.750
I wish to speak to you.

40:46.750 --> 40:48.750
I am done with pity.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.789
I am not play acting the hero.

40:52.010 --> 40:54.949
I have come
with something you desire.

40:57.889 --> 41:01.030
Something
I will never relinquish.

41:01.829 --> 41:04.809
And I will never stop fighting
for them.

41:04.809 --> 41:07.909
Whatever it takes, I will do.

41:09.889 --> 41:11.800
Even this.

41:14.880 --> 41:17.000
I am Doc Holliday.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.829
I do not fear the void.

41:19.829 --> 41:22.800
I spit into the void!

41:22.800 --> 41:24.929
So it seems, Bulshar,

41:24.929 --> 41:26.969
we do have an accord.

41:28.019 --> 41:30.010
I may be going to hell...

41:31.030 --> 41:33.960
but I will drag you with me.

41:51.900 --> 41:53.920
Ding-dong. Anyone home?

41:57.969 --> 42:02.019
Something tells me I'm not getting
more banana liqueur, am I?

42:02.019 --> 42:05.039
Of course, any visit
from a sweet Earp is...

42:05.039 --> 42:07.960
I came to tell you she ain't
coming and she never will.

42:07.960 --> 42:10.889
Oh...
- I'm working real hard on keeping my family safe.

42:10.889 --> 42:13.760
And you know what?
Part of keeping them safe...

42:13.760 --> 42:15.849
means keeping them
the hell away from you.

42:15.849 --> 42:17.780
Wynonna!

42:17.780 --> 42:19.980
I bear news of great joy.

42:20.909 --> 42:22.949
Your sister is blessed.

42:23.780 --> 42:25.929
Her real father,

42:25.929 --> 42:28.900
a fella named... Julian.

42:28.900 --> 42:31.960
- What about him?
- He was an angel.

42:31.960 --> 42:36.840
An honest-to-God,
heavens-above angel.
