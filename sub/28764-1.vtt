WEBVTT

00:06.740 --> 00:08.318
Alright, y'all.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.857
Last time you saw me,
I had a bullet in my head.

00:10.881 --> 00:13.878
What had happened was
shit got crazy in Palmghetto.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.597
Bryce and Jenn bounced to Tampa.

00:20.621 --> 00:21.998
You really out, huh?

00:22.022 --> 00:24.467
I'ma be so squeaky clean up in Tampa.

00:24.491 --> 00:27.014
Meanwhile, Polly's crazy ass

00:27.038 --> 00:28.893
thought her dead twin sister came back,

00:28.895 --> 00:31.207
so Polly checked herself
into the nuthouse.

00:31.231 --> 00:32.542
I'm okay.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.745
Roller swore Uncle Daddy
killed his parents.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.347
Did you kill my dad?

00:37.371 --> 00:39.616
Ruval and Zlata
were scheming behind Des' back.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.017
Once you're married,

00:41.041 --> 00:44.020
everything Desna has
will be community property.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.688
But she took care of them...

00:47.848 --> 00:49.692
...with a little help.

00:51.585 --> 00:55.098
But in the end,
my girl bossed up like a G.

00:55.122 --> 00:57.121
I promised Clint here a piece of the pie

00:57.123 --> 00:58.701
after we got things all squared away.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.303
No deal.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.238
And she got more than she bargained for.

01:02.262 --> 01:04.328
- You got a casino.
- Wait, what?

01:04.331 --> 01:05.730
I got a casino?

01:05.732 --> 01:07.577
What you are about to see
is a cautionary tale.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.045
Be careful what you wish for, y'all.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.237
Help me!

01:14.741 --> 01:16.719
Somebody help us, please!

01:16.743 --> 01:18.010
Help us!

01:19.480 --> 01:21.301
Help us!

01:21.325 --> 01:23.480
- Drive-by?
- She was shot outside of a casino.

01:23.504 --> 01:26.418
- Gunshot wound to the right temple.
- Call the O.R., get me neurosurgery.

01:26.442 --> 01:27.882
- Yes, Doctor.
- Virginia, you're gonna be fine.

01:27.906 --> 01:29.185
- We've got her now.
- Gonna be okay.

01:29.209 --> 01:30.955
- We'll do everything we can.
- Please!

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:51.445 --> 01:53.023
Yo, Des.

01:53.047 --> 01:55.225
Des, hey. You okay?

01:55.249 --> 01:56.382
Yeah.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.896
Dean, I am so sorry.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.365
They were aiming for me,
and then Virginia stepped in front...

02:02.389 --> 02:04.300
From... From what you said
about her injuries,

02:04.324 --> 02:07.170
uh, Virginia has a 23.8% chance
of dying, Des.

02:07.194 --> 02:10.773
23.8% chance. I looked it up on the way.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.242
Who do you think tried to 86 you,

02:12.266 --> 02:13.598
the Russian or the Haitian?

02:13.600 --> 02:14.977
I don't know.

02:15.001 --> 02:17.914
It could be somebody we don't even know.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.804
Roller, I need you to help me find out.

02:19.806 --> 02:23.042
Hey, D, I got you. Okay?

02:24.670 --> 02:27.524
Virginia... she could die because of me.

02:27.839 --> 02:30.593
They could come after me,
and my whole crew is in danger.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.738
I love that suit.

02:41.762 --> 02:42.939
Hmm.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.674
What else do we know about her?

02:47.434 --> 02:50.747
A fair amount, thanks to good Dr. Ruval.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.750
Washes money from
a Dixie Mafia pain clinic

02:53.774 --> 02:55.418
through her salon.

02:55.442 --> 02:58.355
But then things went south
when the Russians got involved.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.890
Oh, that's right.

02:59.914 --> 03:03.159
Ruval was hanging out with that
crazy Russian chick.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.562
Could never understand a thing
that messy whore was saying.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.097
I'm glad they're both dead.

03:07.121 --> 03:09.966
- You think Desna killed them?
- Don't know.

03:09.990 --> 03:14.571
Either way, she's trouble,
and we don't need trouble.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.172
Mm.

03:16.555 --> 03:19.576
Not that kind of trouble, anyway.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.955
We should go by with flowers.

03:25.686 --> 03:27.306
Oh, that's the least we can do.

03:29.075 --> 03:32.054
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

03:46.092 --> 03:49.205
And the year after that,
I bought the new model.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.895
John Deere 3000.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.898
She is a beauty.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.813
Mows real precise.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.102
Down to 1 1/2 inches.

03:58.104 --> 04:01.418
Hell, 1 inch if you like.

04:01.442 --> 04:04.220
You can borrow it any time
if you like it. Mm-hmm.

04:04.603 --> 04:06.812
Sounds like a jamboree.

04:08.106 --> 04:11.161
So, uh, Becky, have long have
you been running Sexy Tips?

04:11.185 --> 04:12.362
About eight years.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.430
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.832
- And you are gonna fit right in.
- Oh!

04:15.856 --> 04:17.300
Oh, my goodness.

04:17.324 --> 04:20.101
- Look at your nails.
- Well...

04:20.125 --> 04:21.772
Oh, we're going to see
the Queen B. tomorrow.

04:21.796 --> 04:23.015
Whoa.

04:23.039 --> 04:24.308
- Drop it.
- Baby.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.308
Baby, you're gonna hurt him.

04:25.332 --> 04:26.531
Baby, don't put the hurt on him.

04:26.533 --> 04:27.732
We don't know them like that.

04:27.734 --> 04:29.179
Baby!

04:29.203 --> 04:31.448
Look out. Wow.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.850
But you might want to

04:33.874 --> 04:36.140
tone down your acrylics just...

04:36.299 --> 04:38.011
- Oh, no.
- Excuse me?

04:38.035 --> 04:40.480
They're just a little, mm, urban?

04:40.504 --> 04:44.151
Oh, you might want to back up,
Becky with the good hair.

04:44.175 --> 04:46.908
What? N... I am not racist...

04:46.910 --> 04:48.021
- No way.
- ...girlfriend.

04:48.045 --> 04:50.958
I love that Ben Carson.

04:50.982 --> 04:52.292
Nah, he's a good one.

04:52.316 --> 04:54.093
- Condoleezza Rice.
- We call her Condi.

04:54.117 --> 04:55.428
Stacey Dash.

04:55.452 --> 04:57.697
- She is practically one of us now.
- Practically?

04:57.721 --> 04:58.698
Will you excuse me?

04:58.722 --> 05:00.099
I have to alert the gas company

05:00.123 --> 05:01.657
about a potential leak.

05:04.996 --> 05:06.974
Des, you got to save me.

05:06.998 --> 05:08.308
Tell me something filthy.

05:08.332 --> 05:10.109
Jenn, I'ma have to call you back, okay?

05:10.133 --> 05:11.911
V-Virginia's in the hospital right now.

05:11.935 --> 05:12.934
What, why?

05:12.936 --> 05:14.603
- She got shot.
- Shot?!

05:16.273 --> 05:17.584
Okay, I'm on my way.

05:17.608 --> 05:20.520
No, no, no, no.
Please do not come here, okay?

05:20.544 --> 05:22.990
Everybody is still in danger.

05:23.014 --> 05:24.924
I'ma call you back.

05:27.284 --> 05:28.928
What about Zlata's daughter, Olga?

05:28.952 --> 05:30.330
I don't know. What about her?

05:30.354 --> 05:32.265
I mean, we weren't
exactly Oprah and Gayle,

05:32.289 --> 05:33.733
but I don't think this little girl

05:33.757 --> 05:35.468
would try to shoot at me
in broad daylight.

05:35.492 --> 05:38.159
So, who else would want to kill you?
I don't know.

05:38.161 --> 05:39.539
Well, what about the Dixie Mafia?

05:39.563 --> 05:41.963
Uncle Daddy felt a way
when he lost the pill mill,

05:41.965 --> 05:45.078
but... And I just inherited a casino.

05:45.102 --> 05:46.279
Maybe somebody from there.

05:46.303 --> 05:47.814
Well, until we figure it out,

05:47.838 --> 05:49.349
we're gonna put a
security detail on your house.

05:49.373 --> 05:51.172
No, no. I can handle it.

05:51.174 --> 05:52.419
Don't be stupid, Desna.

05:52.443 --> 05:53.620
If you're gonna take this on yourself,

05:53.644 --> 05:55.672
I can't help you this time.

05:56.298 --> 05:58.358
- Hey!
- Hey, yourself.

05:58.382 --> 06:00.427
Is Virginia gonna be alright?

06:00.451 --> 06:01.761
We don't know yet.

06:01.785 --> 06:03.162
I should have been there.

06:03.186 --> 06:05.032
No, no. It's not your fault.

06:05.056 --> 06:06.700
Well, I'm not going anywhere. Good.

06:06.724 --> 06:09.168
Listen, I need you to keep
an eye on Virginia's room.

06:09.192 --> 06:12.239
The shooter could come back.

06:28.879 --> 06:31.012
Why are you giving this to me?

06:31.014 --> 06:34.015
Because you have nothing to say.

06:44.361 --> 06:47.228
I have some good news.
Virginia's gonna make it.

06:47.230 --> 06:48.541
Oh, thank God.

06:48.565 --> 06:50.763
The bullet didn't penetrate the cranium,

06:50.787 --> 06:53.172
- but it did affect her eye.
- What?

06:53.196 --> 06:56.539
She had a corneal transplant
from an elderly Reiki healer.

07:02.045 --> 07:03.423
Domino!

07:03.447 --> 07:05.825
Now, that's how you throw bones, pussies!

07:05.849 --> 07:06.886
What, what!

07:06.910 --> 07:08.428
You have a phone call, Polly.

07:08.452 --> 07:10.297
Phone call? Ooh.

07:10.321 --> 07:12.454
I'll take it on the white courtesy phone

07:12.456 --> 07:13.767
in the Flamingo Room.

07:13.791 --> 07:17.258
For the last time, it's just a pay phone.

07:17.260 --> 07:18.661
Killjoy.

07:20.664 --> 07:22.263
- Hello?
- Hey, Polly. It's Ann.

07:22.265 --> 07:25.178
- Hey, what's up, Ann?
- Virginia's in the hospital.

07:25.202 --> 07:26.263
What?

07:28.052 --> 07:31.585
Square dancing's over!
Under new management.

07:31.609 --> 07:34.854
How you livin', Uncle?

07:36.832 --> 07:38.218
Well... good to see you, boy.

07:38.525 --> 07:40.682
About a million ways
I can answer that question.

07:40.684 --> 07:44.854
Number one, I'm living on a cot
in the Messianic Jewish Center.

07:45.323 --> 07:47.391
Number two, I'm about
running out of whiskey.

07:47.415 --> 07:49.660
Was it you who tried to kill Desna?

07:49.684 --> 07:51.483
What are you talking about?

07:51.485 --> 07:53.263
Someone tried to take out Desna?

07:53.287 --> 07:55.876
Yeah, a couple of hours ago
in front of the casino.

07:56.290 --> 07:58.469
Well, I was at Toucan's.

07:58.493 --> 08:00.404
Power tops drink for free on Friday.

08:00.428 --> 08:01.939
Clay, you stay lyin', man.

08:01.963 --> 08:03.541
Think I don't know you're not happy

08:03.565 --> 08:04.957
with the way things end up with Desna?

08:04.959 --> 08:06.811
Hey, I ain't lyin'.

08:06.835 --> 08:08.478
And we both know
why you really pissed off.

08:08.502 --> 08:09.613
Why is that?

08:09.637 --> 08:11.015
Well, 'cause you think
I killed your folks.

08:11.039 --> 08:13.083
I ain't got no time for thinkin'.

08:13.107 --> 08:14.418
I know.

08:14.442 --> 08:16.020
Yeah, you don't know shit.

08:16.044 --> 08:18.648
If I wanted Desna dead, she'd be dead.

08:22.851 --> 08:25.196
The Toucan shit don't add up...

08:26.113 --> 08:27.782
I'ma end you, Clay.

08:29.457 --> 08:31.301
- Hey, oh.
- Watch out, Springsteen.

08:32.727 --> 08:34.772
Things seem tense.

08:34.796 --> 08:36.640
Yeah, 'cause of you.

08:36.664 --> 08:38.842
- What did I do?
- What'd you do?

08:38.866 --> 08:40.644
Tried to convince him I killed his daddy.

08:41.936 --> 08:44.507
Now he thinks I tried to kill Desna, too.

08:46.007 --> 08:48.219
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

08:49.010 --> 08:51.056
I ain't saying I shot her,

08:51.479 --> 08:53.746
but I do know karma's a bitch.

09:01.756 --> 09:03.276
Yes, it is.

09:08.096 --> 09:11.598
Paging Dr. Ross. Dr. Ross to the O.R.

09:15.770 --> 09:17.147
- Desna Simms?
- Yes?

09:17.171 --> 09:18.482
I'm Mac Lovestone.

09:18.506 --> 09:21.886
And this is my beautiful
and intelligent wife, Melba.

09:21.910 --> 09:23.353
So very nice to meet you.

09:23.377 --> 09:24.688
Okay.

09:24.712 --> 09:27.291
We just wish
the circumstances were brighter.

09:34.055 --> 09:36.834
20 years of cigs will get you eventually.

09:36.858 --> 09:38.769
I-I'm sorry. Who are you?

09:38.793 --> 09:40.504
We were your husband's partners

09:40.528 --> 09:43.708
over at Bayside Rapture Hotel & Casino.

09:43.732 --> 09:45.576
I didn't know Gregory had partners.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.712
I thought he owned the whole thing,

09:47.736 --> 09:50.047
meaning I own the whole thing.

09:50.071 --> 09:51.982
- Oh.
- Oh, no.

09:52.006 --> 09:53.451
You... You were mistaken.

09:53.475 --> 09:55.119
Bayside is a Native casino,

09:55.143 --> 09:58.522
and by law, non-Natives can
only be minority stakeholders.

09:58.546 --> 09:59.746
Huh.

10:01.015 --> 10:05.195
Oh, I have a little
Native American inside me.

10:05.219 --> 10:06.931
Every night around 9:30.

10:06.955 --> 10:09.800
Who you calling little? I'm 5'11".

10:09.824 --> 10:11.335
You are. You are a big man.

10:11.359 --> 10:12.403
Ohh. You're a big man.

10:12.427 --> 10:14.204
Thank you, baby.

10:14.228 --> 10:16.406
Wha...

10:16.430 --> 10:20.144
We'd just like to give you back
Greg's stake in the casino.

10:20.168 --> 10:22.613
That way, you can start
your process of healing

10:22.637 --> 10:25.105
after your tragic loss.

10:26.975 --> 10:28.503
$50,000?

10:28.527 --> 10:30.196
You deserve it.

10:31.379 --> 10:34.092
Yeah, well, I...

10:34.116 --> 10:38.851
I'ma need a little time
to process all of this.

10:38.853 --> 10:40.965
My friend has just been shot.

10:40.989 --> 10:42.767
If I were you, I would just take it.

10:42.791 --> 10:44.168
Just walk away

10:44.192 --> 10:46.370
and wash your hands of the whole mess.

10:46.394 --> 10:47.994
Well... Whoa.

10:49.664 --> 10:51.121
Okay.

10:51.145 --> 10:53.333
Okay. We're good.

10:55.670 --> 10:57.315
Enjoy this bounty.

11:12.285 --> 11:13.618
50,000...

11:13.754 --> 11:15.154
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- ...dollars?

11:15.156 --> 11:17.334
You know how many jumpsuits
you could buy with this?

11:17.358 --> 11:19.270
Yeah, but I don't just want the jumpsuit.

11:19.294 --> 11:21.939
I want the purse and the shoes to match.

11:21.963 --> 11:24.141
They ain't gettin' rid of me this easy.

11:24.165 --> 11:27.144
I don't know, Des.
They seem sketchy to me.

11:27.168 --> 11:29.414
I-I say just take the money and run.

11:29.438 --> 11:33.550
But the casino could take our
game to a whole nother level.

11:33.574 --> 11:36.754
That's what I'm talking about.

11:36.778 --> 11:37.888
Roller.

11:37.912 --> 11:39.556
It wasn't Uncle Daddy.

11:39.580 --> 11:40.625
It wasn't Uncle Daddy.

11:40.649 --> 11:42.427
What about the Haitians or the Russians?

11:42.451 --> 11:44.561
- I talked to everybody.
- Shit.

11:44.585 --> 11:47.965
Look, this creepy Native American guy

11:47.989 --> 11:50.100
and his golfer lady wife came over here,

11:50.124 --> 11:52.169
throwing around a fat-ass check.

11:52.193 --> 11:53.971
Maybe they the ones
that tried to kill me.

11:53.995 --> 11:55.906
Hey, D, I got a little
connect at the casino.

11:55.930 --> 11:57.196
My boy works security,

11:57.198 --> 11:58.709
so I could do a little digging around.

11:58.733 --> 12:00.110
- I got this.
- Okay, good.

12:00.134 --> 12:01.912
Anything you can do, Roller.

12:01.936 --> 12:04.195
We got a target on our backs.

12:04.219 --> 12:06.183
I got you, D.

12:11.946 --> 12:14.125
Time for your meds.

12:14.149 --> 12:15.392
Here you go.

12:15.416 --> 12:16.661
Thank you.

12:16.685 --> 12:18.885
Down the hatch.

12:21.890 --> 12:24.001
Ahh, ahh, ahh.

12:24.025 --> 12:25.424
Good girl.

12:25.426 --> 12:27.826
I'm just gonna have an early evening,

12:27.828 --> 12:29.540
so I don't need any turndown service,

12:29.564 --> 12:31.097
but thank you.

12:46.447 --> 12:47.847
Oh!

12:47.849 --> 12:49.827
Shit.

12:49.851 --> 12:50.895
Polly!

12:50.919 --> 12:51.962
Huh?

12:51.986 --> 12:53.252
No, no, unh-unh.

12:53.254 --> 12:54.365
You're not gonna stop me.

12:54.389 --> 12:56.701
I won't be defined by my diagnosis.

12:56.725 --> 12:58.769
It's a voluntary ward.

12:58.793 --> 13:02.773
If you want to go, you can
walk out the front door.

13:02.797 --> 13:04.375
Good to know.

13:04.399 --> 13:05.465
Some help?

13:08.136 --> 13:10.647
Yo. So, how dirty are these casino folks?

13:10.671 --> 13:11.871
Killin' dirty?

13:11.873 --> 13:13.450
Who I look like, "Murder, She Wrote"?

13:13.474 --> 13:16.675
They dirty, like Flint water dirty.

13:16.677 --> 13:18.322
Yeah, but they mobbed up?

13:18.346 --> 13:20.057
I swear it...

13:24.419 --> 13:26.731
Go ask 'em your damn self.

13:26.755 --> 13:28.533
Seatbelts, please.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.734
This is gonna be fun!

13:41.302 --> 13:44.749
Please, no.

13:46.507 --> 13:48.085
Please. No, please.

13:50.044 --> 13:54.358
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no! No, no, please!

13:54.382 --> 13:55.915
No, no, no, no, no, please, please!

13:55.917 --> 13:57.494
Please, please, please, please!

13:57.518 --> 14:01.498
Then do what we need you to do
and stay in your place.

14:01.522 --> 14:03.167
Okay! Okay, okay, okay, okay!

14:03.191 --> 14:04.701
I'll back off! I promise!

14:04.725 --> 14:06.837
That's great.

14:06.861 --> 14:08.639
We'll see you at work Monday.

14:08.663 --> 14:11.730
And I don't want to see these
two hours on your timecard.

14:21.476 --> 14:23.454
Oh, thank God Virginia's okay.

14:23.478 --> 14:25.456
I knew our girl would pull through.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.926
Polly, I had no idea
you could cook soul food.

14:28.950 --> 14:31.150
What are you, like an octoroon?

14:31.152 --> 14:32.329
Well, you know,

14:32.353 --> 14:34.131
my family doesn't like to talk about it,

14:34.155 --> 14:36.267
but we've been
passing for white for years.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.335
- Girl, shut up.
- No, it's true.

14:38.359 --> 14:41.961
Patti LaBelle's cousin's cousin
is my cousin!

14:41.963 --> 14:43.340
You should taste my sweet potato pie,

14:43.364 --> 14:45.139
and then you'd know for sure. Mm-hmm.

14:45.163 --> 14:47.077
I'm just glad you're out of the nuthouse.

14:47.101 --> 14:48.946
Well, I'm not really out out.

14:48.970 --> 14:50.281
I'm still on crazy parole.

14:50.305 --> 14:53.951
Regular medication checks,
weekly psychotherapy,

14:53.975 --> 14:55.374
group sessions on Sundays.

14:55.376 --> 14:56.553
Can you believe that? Eeh.

14:56.577 --> 14:58.155
But no more Lillian, right?

14:58.179 --> 15:00.272
No, no, just me.

15:01.516 --> 15:04.094
- Mm! Hey, Deanie.
- Hey.

15:04.118 --> 15:06.363
I didn't know, um, you were coming here.

15:06.387 --> 15:07.564
You want me to fix you a plate?

15:07.588 --> 15:08.966
No, I'm... I'm just here to pick up

15:08.990 --> 15:10.501
some of my... of my... my clothes.

15:10.525 --> 15:12.569
- How did you get over here?
- The bus.

15:12.593 --> 15:14.171
You got to be careful, Dean.

15:14.195 --> 15:16.774
Listen to me.
The people who tried to kill me

15:16.798 --> 15:19.243
could easily come after
the people that I love, baby.

15:19.267 --> 15:21.111
We can't take them kind of chances.

15:21.135 --> 15:24.003
It's okay. I'm... I'm okay.

15:24.005 --> 15:25.916
I can handle myself.

15:25.940 --> 15:27.184
Dean, listen...

15:27.208 --> 15:28.407
I-I'm just gonna pick up my stuff,

15:28.409 --> 15:29.987
and then I'm gonna go see my lady.

15:30.011 --> 15:32.323
I...

15:37.352 --> 15:38.529
What'd you find out?

15:38.553 --> 15:41.466
Man, them casino folks
on some next-level shit!

15:41.490 --> 15:42.667
What?

15:42.691 --> 15:44.535
Yeah, and they almost killed this chick.

15:44.559 --> 15:47.872
Wha... Wait, wait.
So, where is that girl now?

15:47.896 --> 15:49.140
In the back seat.

15:49.164 --> 15:50.541
Who the hell are you?!

15:50.565 --> 15:52.209
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Hey, hey, hey!

15:52.233 --> 15:53.277
- Hey!
- Roller!

15:53.301 --> 15:54.812
Hey! What are you doing?!

15:54.836 --> 15:56.681
♪ ...get you one

16:02.043 --> 16:03.954
D, I got to go! God!

16:03.978 --> 16:05.444
Shit!

16:05.446 --> 16:06.824
Hello?!

16:06.848 --> 16:08.159
Shit.

16:28.403 --> 16:30.848
Get down. Get down!

16:34.409 --> 16:35.986
Shit!

16:41.216 --> 16:43.383
Front door open.

16:47.889 --> 16:49.133
Dean!

16:49.157 --> 16:51.068
What are you doing?

16:51.092 --> 16:52.737
I'm... I'm going to the crime scene

16:52.761 --> 16:54.493
to... to... to find some evidence.

16:54.495 --> 16:56.207
I'm gonna find out who shot Virginia.

16:56.231 --> 16:57.408
With my gun?!

16:57.432 --> 16:59.343
Are you... Have you lost your mind?

16:59.367 --> 17:00.878
My... My Lyft will be here
in two minutes.

17:00.902 --> 17:02.213
- Two.
- Give me the gun.

17:02.237 --> 17:03.814
If I... If I give you the gun,

17:03.838 --> 17:05.704
then how am I gonna kill
the shooter when I locate him?

17:05.705 --> 17:09.420
Dean, take your black ass
back in the house... now!

17:09.444 --> 17:10.459
No.

17:10.483 --> 17:11.821
Gilbert and his Kia Sorento

17:11.846 --> 17:13.624
will be here any moment, Des.

17:13.647 --> 17:15.560
Boy, I don't give a shit if you waiting

17:15.584 --> 17:17.516
for George Clinton and the Mothership.

17:17.518 --> 17:19.829
- I am not playing with you, Dean Simms.
- Dessy, I'm a man!

17:19.854 --> 17:21.698
And a man is supposed
to take care of his lady.

17:21.722 --> 17:22.900
He's supposed to protect her.

17:22.924 --> 17:24.435
He's supposed to protect his lady.

17:24.861 --> 17:27.726
Dean, you are a black man with a gun.

17:27.728 --> 17:30.241
- Remember Philando Castile?
- Yes, Des.

17:30.265 --> 17:32.109
- Remember that?
- Yes, yes, yes, Des, yes.

17:32.133 --> 17:33.532
Dean, I...

17:33.534 --> 17:38.405
I am tired of taking care
of everything and everybody.

17:41.810 --> 17:45.056
- Somebody tried to kill me. Hmm?
- Mm.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.857
- And you just killed somebody.
- Mm.

17:46.881 --> 17:48.659
And now you want to
go out in these streets

17:48.683 --> 17:50.261
and hurt somebody else?

17:50.285 --> 17:52.151
I'm not having it.

17:52.153 --> 17:54.331
Gimme the goddamn gun! Now!

17:54.355 --> 17:56.533
Okay, okay, fine.

17:56.557 --> 17:57.735
Take it.

17:57.759 --> 18:00.271
It was forcefully stated.
I'll stay for now.

18:00.295 --> 18:01.939
But... But I'm gonna find out who did it,

18:01.963 --> 18:04.074
and... and then I'm gonna kill him.

18:13.851 --> 18:15.791
I want you to go sit down in the chapel

18:15.815 --> 18:17.653
where it's nice and quiet
for a little bit, okay?

18:17.655 --> 18:19.551
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

18:19.575 --> 18:21.091
Hey.

18:21.115 --> 18:22.501
- Hey.
- My mom made brisket.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.680
Oh, thanks.

18:23.704 --> 18:25.682
So, uh, how's Virginia?

18:25.706 --> 18:27.017
She's recovering.

18:27.041 --> 18:28.604
Listen, I need your help with Dean.

18:28.628 --> 18:30.004
He is going through something,

18:30.028 --> 18:31.863
and I have no idea what he might do.

18:31.865 --> 18:34.088
Okay, well, I'm out of a job, Desna.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.692
- What's going on with the clinic?
- Okay, one thing at a time, Kenneth.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.894
Right now, I need you to go in the chapel

18:38.918 --> 18:41.163
and talk him through his feelings.

18:41.187 --> 18:43.966
But I'm just a dealer...
I mean, I'm a doctor.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.567
I'm not a therapist.

18:45.591 --> 18:46.768
Okay, but your mama is.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.304
Some of that shit had to rub off.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.572
Besides, you want him
talking to a stranger

18:50.596 --> 18:51.773
about the shit that went down?

18:51.797 --> 18:52.996
I'm just a general practitioner.

18:52.998 --> 18:54.576
I know general medical things.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.178
He said he wanted to track down

18:56.202 --> 18:58.648
the person who shot Virginia
and hurt them.

18:58.672 --> 19:00.316
With what, his colored pencils?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.518
He needs help, Kenneth.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.120
I-I don't... I don't have
any specialized training

19:05.144 --> 19:07.611
except for the podiatry seminar
in the Keys.

19:07.613 --> 19:10.259
He's in the chapel. Go.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.328
Now.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.485
Okay, okay.

19:23.829 --> 19:27.191
So, Dean, how... how are your feet?

19:27.833 --> 19:29.211
Th-They're well, thank you.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.634
I-I-I wear gel insoles.

19:30.636 --> 19:32.837
Oh, me, too. Me, too. Mm.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.220
I hear you're feeling upset.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.690
I'm no longer suffering from any upset.

19:40.714 --> 19:43.292
My main focus now is to take action.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.427
I know my sister can't handle me
wanting to murder someone,

19:45.451 --> 19:49.699
but a black man has to take
action and fight the power.

19:49.723 --> 19:52.056
Well, you realize we're in Florida.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.235
Yeah.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.437
I will take a knee and a gun
for my beliefs.

19:55.461 --> 19:56.505
Yeah.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.773
Maybe it would be better

19:57.797 --> 20:00.576
if you focused your, um, negative emotion

20:00.600 --> 20:02.866
into something positive.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.646
What you really need is a new purpose,

20:04.670 --> 20:06.870
something to put your energy in.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.584
What could you do?

20:08.608 --> 20:10.709
Drawing. You're... You're good at that.

20:10.733 --> 20:12.677
Stripping?

20:14.014 --> 20:15.524
You're great at that.

20:15.549 --> 20:16.749
You do a few cherry pops,

20:16.774 --> 20:18.551
see if that doesn't calm you down.

20:18.576 --> 20:20.888
Cherry pops are not the answer, Dr. Ken.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.265
The only thing that will
give me satisfaction

20:23.289 --> 20:26.090
is hunting down the animals
that shot Virginia

20:26.092 --> 20:27.603
and blowing their heads off.

20:27.627 --> 20:31.073
I'm gonna a-assume that you're upset

20:31.097 --> 20:32.608
and, uh, prone to hyperbole.

20:32.632 --> 20:35.760
Dr. Ken, I killed before.
I'm very good at it.

20:36.282 --> 20:37.720
Very, very good.

20:38.704 --> 20:40.973
The sensation is oddly satisfying.

20:41.775 --> 20:43.619
I just don't want anyone

20:43.643 --> 20:48.424
to hurt anybody in my family ever again.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.472
Aww, this is from Bambi.

21:02.497 --> 21:04.407
- Peaches?
- Peaches!

21:04.730 --> 21:05.908
- Hi.
- Jenn!

21:05.932 --> 21:07.109
- Jenn?
- Oh, hi.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.391
- What are you doing here?
- Jennifer Husser,

21:08.415 --> 21:10.222
I told you to keep
your black ass in Tampa.

21:10.246 --> 21:13.190
Girl, you know I can't
stay away when I want to.

21:13.214 --> 21:14.784
Well, she's not up yet.

21:14.808 --> 21:17.186
Oh, God. Look at her.

21:17.210 --> 21:20.055
Not a single pore. How does she do it?

21:20.079 --> 21:22.591
It's easy, girl. Noxzema.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.118
Virginia! Virginia!

21:24.142 --> 21:25.483
Wait.

21:25.509 --> 21:27.287
Why can I only see out of one eye?

21:27.287 --> 21:28.598
Okay. It's okay.

21:28.622 --> 21:29.865
Am I missing an eye?

21:29.889 --> 21:31.066
Shh! No, no, no. No, no, no.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.535
The bullet just... it grazed you.

21:33.559 --> 21:35.070
- It's just a graze.
- Okay?

21:35.094 --> 21:37.473
A-A-And you had
to have a cornea transplant,

21:37.497 --> 21:38.874
but you are gonna be fine.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.054
A cornea transplant?

21:40.078 --> 21:41.740
Your other cornea is bullshit.

21:41.764 --> 21:43.636
Thank God, I saved my Bedazzler

21:43.661 --> 21:45.014
- from high school.
- Check this out.

21:45.038 --> 21:47.571
And we hooked your pretty little ass up.

21:47.573 --> 21:49.084
- Ooh, la la!
- Que lindo!

21:49.108 --> 21:51.621
And you're only gonna have to
wear it for a few days anyway.

21:51.645 --> 21:53.288
That's so beautiful. It's denim.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.272
You'll look as hot as ever,
like a sexual pirate.

21:55.274 --> 21:57.315
Virginia? Virginia.

22:00.386 --> 22:02.298
I-I-I was extremely anxious,

22:02.322 --> 22:04.966
but... but I-I checked out
your doctor on Yelp,

22:04.990 --> 22:06.726
a-and he has 4 1/2 stars.

22:07.834 --> 22:09.211
I-I'll be right back in a sec.

22:09.236 --> 22:10.346
- Just...
- Okay.

22:10.938 --> 22:12.796
Look what Polly made me.

22:12.798 --> 22:15.110
So, what's going on? How is he?

22:15.134 --> 22:18.180
Desna, your brother has
a serious revenge fantasy.

22:18.204 --> 22:19.581
You definitely have
to keep an eye on him.

22:19.605 --> 22:21.017
Encourage him to find a new focus.

22:21.017 --> 22:23.195
I've been keeping an eye on him
my whole life, Kenneth.

22:23.219 --> 22:24.396
That's not gonna change.

22:24.420 --> 22:26.732
Good, because I think
he's blurring his fantasy life

22:26.756 --> 22:27.771
with real life.

22:27.795 --> 22:29.081
Say what, now?

22:30.026 --> 22:32.460
He told me he killed someone.

22:33.029 --> 22:34.295
He said that?

22:35.254 --> 22:39.679
He's probably just
exhausted and dehydrated.

22:39.703 --> 22:43.015
Um, I'ma get him some kombucha.

22:43.039 --> 22:45.222
H-He'll be fine. Thanks.

22:48.517 --> 22:49.621
So?

22:49.645 --> 22:50.890
What happened with the girl

22:50.914 --> 22:52.291
that Mac and Melba tried to kill?

22:52.315 --> 22:53.493
Did you talk to her?

22:53.517 --> 22:54.827
Bitch pulled a "Lady Bird" on me.

22:54.851 --> 22:57.497
- She jumped out the car?
- Yeah, yeah.

22:57.521 --> 22:59.653
I'm surprised your ass saw that movie.

22:59.655 --> 23:01.901
- Well, only the first scene.
- Shit.

23:01.925 --> 23:04.370
Yo, I couldn't catch her, but
she left her purse in my car.

23:04.394 --> 23:05.771
Well, good. Did you go to her house?

23:05.795 --> 23:08.774
Yeah, old girl tried to shoot my ass.

23:08.798 --> 23:09.931
Shit.

23:11.535 --> 23:13.179
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

23:13.203 --> 23:14.847
Um, why didn't you call me?

23:14.871 --> 23:16.516
I didn't know you got out.

23:16.540 --> 23:19.051
I got the Bat-Signal.
I had to see Virginia.

23:19.075 --> 23:20.720
I was gonna call you after.

23:20.744 --> 23:22.121
Well, you want to grab dinner?

23:22.145 --> 23:24.190
We can do Mexican... your favorite.

23:24.214 --> 23:26.258
Not with everything that's going on.

23:26.282 --> 23:28.883
Oh, we can, uh... we can
make it short. Entrées only.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.885
No guac before and no flan after.

23:30.887 --> 23:33.487
I'm just really worried about,
you know, Virginia's eye.

23:33.489 --> 23:36.602
Well Virginia's eye
doesn't care whether you...

23:36.626 --> 23:38.292
I'll talk to you later, okay?

23:38.294 --> 23:39.805
- Okay?
- You... You... You look...

23:39.829 --> 23:41.673
You look good, Polly.

23:41.697 --> 23:43.739
Plaid has never looked better.

23:56.312 --> 23:57.753
What's up?

23:58.047 --> 24:00.589
- I can feel something's wrong.
- I-I'm just worried

24:00.613 --> 24:03.429
that whoever hurt you I-is
gonna come back and kill us.

24:03.453 --> 24:06.432
They're not coming back.
Everything's gonna be alright.

24:06.456 --> 24:07.521
But... But you don't know that.

24:07.523 --> 24:09.235
I do.

24:09.259 --> 24:11.837
Everything happens for a reason, Dean.

24:11.861 --> 24:14.306
Maybe it's God or the Buddha

24:14.330 --> 24:16.709
or a big, beautiful queen in the sky

24:16.733 --> 24:19.024
with a poppin' weave named Tanika.

24:19.775 --> 24:23.571
Whoever it is, they have a plan.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.718
Everything that's ever happened...

24:25.742 --> 24:29.343
me getting shot, Joseline
leaving "Love & Hip Hop,"

24:29.345 --> 24:32.058
everyone wearing high-waisted jeans...

24:32.082 --> 24:35.165
is all a part of a divine order.

24:35.752 --> 24:37.663
There's something different about you.

24:37.687 --> 24:40.266
Mm. I do feel kinda funny.

24:40.290 --> 24:41.667
I-I-I think you're just suffering

24:41.691 --> 24:43.669
from the effects of the anesthesia.

24:43.693 --> 24:45.271
C-Can I get you something? Your phone?

24:45.295 --> 24:48.408
I bet a lot's happened
on... on Instagram and Snapchat.

24:48.432 --> 24:50.231
No, baby, I'm okay.

24:53.102 --> 24:56.270
Never felt better.

25:00.243 --> 25:01.421
May I help you?

25:01.445 --> 25:04.778
Yeah, uh, just wanted to return this.

25:04.780 --> 25:06.047
How'd you get this?

25:07.383 --> 25:08.382
Aw, hell, no.

25:08.384 --> 25:09.495
Wait.

25:09.519 --> 25:11.820
We know what Mac and Melba did to you.

25:13.056 --> 25:14.705
We wanna help.

25:19.729 --> 25:22.442
Why'd you catch that beatdown?

25:22.466 --> 25:23.998
And why should I trust you?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.178
I'm part owner of the casino now.

25:26.202 --> 25:28.047
We can protect you.

25:28.071 --> 25:29.915
No one can protect me from them.

25:29.939 --> 25:32.206
Y'all don't know Mac and Melba.

25:32.208 --> 25:34.433
Y'all in bed with the devil.

25:35.011 --> 25:39.413
Well, whenever they get finished
with what they need you for,

25:39.415 --> 25:42.328
you gonna end up
catching a bullet in your head.

25:42.352 --> 25:44.786
Yeah, them windows don't look
bulletproof to me.

25:50.360 --> 25:51.804
Okay.

25:51.828 --> 25:53.739
Why don't we just go to the police?

25:53.763 --> 25:55.607
I'll call my guy up.

25:55.631 --> 25:56.742
Okay, okay, okay! Okay, look.

25:56.766 --> 25:58.010
I'm the accountant

25:58.034 --> 25:59.945
for the biggest money launderer
in the state.

25:59.969 --> 26:01.347
I'm just as guilty as they are.

26:01.371 --> 26:04.750
They just got pissed because
I asked for a pay raise

26:04.774 --> 26:06.018
to keep doing their dirty business.

26:06.042 --> 26:07.286
Why didn't they kill you?

26:07.310 --> 26:09.093
Because they need me.

26:09.513 --> 26:10.945
What they don't know is...

26:14.650 --> 26:16.628
...I got this.

26:16.652 --> 26:18.097
Yes, bitch.

26:18.121 --> 26:21.055
And by the way, I cut that check for you.

26:21.057 --> 26:24.626
That 50 grand? Boo, you got robbed.

26:28.964 --> 26:31.377
The flash drive said
the casino is laundering

26:31.401 --> 26:33.067
$2 million a month.

26:33.069 --> 26:34.847
That sounds like killin' money to me.

26:34.871 --> 26:36.382
You think the casino freaks killed you?

26:36.406 --> 26:38.050
Maybe they want Ruval's cut?

26:38.074 --> 26:39.919
That didn't work out,
so they tried to buy you out.

26:39.943 --> 26:41.521
Virginia could have been killed.

26:41.545 --> 26:43.322
I am so sick of this shit.

26:43.346 --> 26:45.257
I'm tired of people
thinking they can play me

26:45.281 --> 26:47.059
and that I'm just gonna
roll over and take it.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.260
I'm done.

26:48.284 --> 26:50.863
I'm taking this casino,
and I'm protecting my girls.

26:50.887 --> 26:52.064
I don't know, D.

26:52.088 --> 26:53.665
I think you should listen to homegirl.

26:53.689 --> 26:55.735
I mean, they tortured her
for asking for a raise.

26:55.759 --> 26:57.002
Sure you want those kind of problems?

26:57.026 --> 26:59.872
The old Desna wouldn't have.

27:01.231 --> 27:02.674
But I'm a boss now.

27:02.698 --> 27:04.076
If you a boss,

27:04.100 --> 27:05.983
you should lock the front door.

27:07.103 --> 27:08.703
We gotta talk.

27:10.907 --> 27:12.948
I know who tried to take you out.

27:36.666 --> 27:38.199
Alright, bitch.

27:42.405 --> 27:44.338
Why would Clint want to kill me?

27:44.340 --> 27:46.252
He's pissed you didn't take the deal.

27:46.276 --> 27:47.920
Thought you disrespected our family.

27:47.944 --> 27:49.521
And you just now tellin' us?

27:49.545 --> 27:51.657
- 'Cause I just found out.
- Bullshit.

27:51.681 --> 27:53.147
Why would you give your boy up?

27:53.149 --> 27:55.261
I did it for you, Roller. That's why.

27:55.285 --> 27:58.264
I know it's been bad between us.
That's about to change.

27:58.288 --> 28:00.496
Clint's family, but so are you.

28:01.291 --> 28:03.058
Do what you want with that.

28:12.629 --> 28:14.629
_

28:16.413 --> 28:18.413
_

28:21.056 --> 28:23.056
_

28:24.209 --> 28:25.424
_

28:54.077 --> 28:56.188
- You're not getting off that easy.
- What do you want?!

28:56.212 --> 28:57.523
You don't even return my calls!

28:57.547 --> 28:58.991
Oh, we been through this shit
before, alright?

28:59.015 --> 29:00.526
I'm not doing it again!

29:00.550 --> 29:01.815
Yeah, we are.

29:01.817 --> 29:02.951
Bitch.

29:16.566 --> 29:18.133
Hey.

29:20.436 --> 29:21.613
Is Clint in there, huh?

29:21.637 --> 29:22.887
- No, he's not here.
- Huh?

29:22.911 --> 29:24.272
Is everything okay?

29:25.509 --> 29:27.583
No, everything's not okay.

29:28.578 --> 29:29.755
Found out it was Clint

29:29.779 --> 29:31.623
who tried to kill Desna, didn't you?

29:31.647 --> 29:33.625
Roller, Clint's gone crazy.

29:33.649 --> 29:35.027
Hey, Toby.

29:35.051 --> 29:36.228
It's gonna be alright.
Take a deep breath.

29:36.252 --> 29:39.031
No, it's not gonna be okay, Roller.

29:39.055 --> 29:42.097
He asked me to dump his motorcycle gear.

29:42.658 --> 29:44.570
That makes me an accessory.

29:44.594 --> 29:45.771
Listen to me.

29:45.795 --> 29:48.437
You see him, you hit me up, okay?

29:48.998 --> 29:51.465
I will if he doesn't kill me first.

29:51.467 --> 29:52.834
You'll be alright.

29:57.273 --> 29:59.441
I'm gonna need you
to get on the waxing train.

30:02.078 --> 30:03.535
What's going on?

30:04.013 --> 30:06.079
That was just a drive-by.

30:07.083 --> 30:09.061
Come again?

30:09.085 --> 30:11.251
Get in, get off, get out.

30:12.622 --> 30:14.171
You serious?

30:14.824 --> 30:17.325
- After all that?
- After all that.

30:20.163 --> 30:23.097
So, how's Tampa? Details.

30:23.099 --> 30:25.144
It's... beautiful.

30:25.168 --> 30:26.612
It's beautiful.

30:26.636 --> 30:29.281
I mean, it's... You know, it's
way better than Palmetto.

30:29.305 --> 30:30.939
Y'all happy out there, huh?

30:32.642 --> 30:34.108
It's... It's magical.

30:34.110 --> 30:35.354
Yeah, yeah.

30:35.378 --> 30:38.490
Ooh, y'all got, uh...
Queen B. there tonight.

30:38.514 --> 30:40.492
Abort, abort. That's sensitive right now.

30:40.516 --> 30:41.827
We're not gonna talk about it.

30:43.319 --> 30:45.319
- Hey. What's up, baby?
- What's up, Roller?

30:45.321 --> 30:46.165
Kiss me.

30:46.189 --> 30:47.233
Whoo!

30:47.257 --> 30:48.342
- Whoa!
- She's mine, now.

30:48.366 --> 30:50.169
- Vicar of Christ.
- How you doing, man?

30:50.193 --> 30:52.193
Ain't you supposed to be
at Beyoncé's concert?

30:55.665 --> 30:57.777
Uh...

30:57.801 --> 30:59.133
Is, um...

30:59.135 --> 31:00.913
- What?
- What's going on with Roller?

31:00.937 --> 31:02.336
Nothing.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.584
- Girl, please.
- Uh...

31:04.608 --> 31:07.787
Mom, Brienne's drowning!

31:07.811 --> 31:09.255
Again?

31:09.279 --> 31:11.880
Come on! Come on, baby!

31:13.617 --> 31:16.862
Uncle Daddy wasn't lying.
Clint tried to kill you.

31:16.886 --> 31:18.664
How can you be sure?

31:18.688 --> 31:19.665
Toby co-signed.

31:19.689 --> 31:21.467
- Toby?
- Yeah.

31:21.491 --> 31:24.116
Only honest one out of the bunch.

31:24.694 --> 31:27.244
He tried to have him cover for him.

31:28.097 --> 31:30.075
Lying piece of shit.

31:30.099 --> 31:31.477
He's gonna be at the Jew Center tonight.

31:31.501 --> 31:33.167
I'ma roll through and handle it.

31:33.169 --> 31:34.814
Not by yourself, you're not.

31:34.838 --> 31:38.017
That corn-pone-hick tried to murder me.

31:38.041 --> 31:41.174
We in this one together.

31:41.711 --> 31:43.823
♪ Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

32:10.474 --> 32:12.184
Oh, shit.

32:12.208 --> 32:14.720
There that asshole is right there.

32:34.830 --> 32:36.208
Shit!

32:49.378 --> 32:51.286
I don't know.

32:51.981 --> 32:54.414
My daddy took me fishing once.

32:54.984 --> 32:57.563
He said, "Hey, Dwayne Beverly,
get your ass down here.

32:57.587 --> 32:59.699
We goin' fishing, son."

32:59.723 --> 33:01.366
Got in the car.

33:01.390 --> 33:04.341
Said, "Dad, you forgot
the fishing poles."

33:05.128 --> 33:07.700
He said, "We don't need 'em, son."

33:10.734 --> 33:13.000
- Alright.
- Oh, I feel sick.

33:13.002 --> 33:15.047
Let's just get this shit over with.

33:15.071 --> 33:17.229
This is the sweet spot here, baby.

33:22.345 --> 33:23.989
Hurry up.

33:24.013 --> 33:28.393
Alright. It's time to feed
the gators, baby.

33:29.619 --> 33:32.411
Aah!

33:40.097 --> 33:43.342
D, your girls are safe now.

33:56.646 --> 33:59.158
I feel... I feel like
I'm gonna be sick, Roller.

33:59.182 --> 34:03.762
I can't stop seeing him, Zlata,
and Ruval staring back at me.

34:03.786 --> 34:05.164
Hey... Hey, D.

34:05.188 --> 34:06.670
- That's gonna pass.
- Mnh-mnh.

34:06.694 --> 34:08.167
Hey.

34:08.190 --> 34:09.857
There's no one gonna hurt you.
I promise you.

34:09.859 --> 34:10.996
- That's why I'm here.
- Yes.

34:11.021 --> 34:12.059
I'ma take care of you.

34:12.061 --> 34:14.261
I thought that getting rid of him

34:14.263 --> 34:16.641
was gonna make me feel better,
but, Roller, I feel worse.

34:16.666 --> 34:17.847
My heart is beatin' fast.

34:17.871 --> 34:18.978
- My hands are shakin'.
- Hey, hey, hey.

34:19.002 --> 34:20.266
- Look at me.
- And...

34:20.268 --> 34:22.380
We're in this together, okay?

34:22.405 --> 34:26.590
- Yeah, but I...
- You and me. Together, okay?

34:45.293 --> 34:47.672
We better get going if
we're gonna beat the traffic.

34:50.976 --> 34:52.072
Yep.

34:53.302 --> 34:54.880
We should really get going.

35:09.186 --> 35:12.231
Why aren't you moving?
Thought you liked Tampa.

35:12.255 --> 35:13.822
I thought you did.

35:16.312 --> 35:19.025
Baby.

35:19.396 --> 35:20.973
Who were we tryin' to fool?

35:20.997 --> 35:22.708
We could move to Antarctica,

35:22.732 --> 35:26.167
and our hearts will still belong
to this hillbilly shitshow town.

35:30.339 --> 35:32.117
Good.

35:32.141 --> 35:34.453
'Cause Tampa Becky and her Sexy Tips

35:34.477 --> 35:38.537
can suck my big, white, crusty ass crack.

35:38.882 --> 35:40.926
- Baby, for real?
- For real.

35:40.950 --> 35:42.728
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

35:42.752 --> 35:45.064
- Baby!
- Ohh.

35:45.088 --> 35:47.332
I love how in sync we are.

35:47.356 --> 35:48.868
Mm!

35:51.094 --> 35:54.762
All this decisiveness is
getting me kinda hot. Oh, yeah?

35:55.884 --> 35:58.677
Maybe you could just, you know... Hm?

35:58.701 --> 36:00.546
Just give me a hand?

36:00.570 --> 36:01.785
Oh.

36:02.772 --> 36:04.149
Give you a hand.

36:09.713 --> 36:11.356
There it is.

36:11.380 --> 36:13.693
- Baby.
- Baby.

36:13.717 --> 36:14.815
We see you!

36:15.384 --> 36:18.186
- Mama is cold.
- Turn around.

36:20.990 --> 36:22.301
Baby, you know I love those kids,

36:22.325 --> 36:23.836
but I will throw a toaster in that pool

36:23.860 --> 36:25.238
if they don't let me get this nut.

36:25.262 --> 36:28.307
I understand.

36:30.399 --> 36:32.778
Oh, man, D.

36:32.802 --> 36:35.781
- Ooh.
- Oh, shit.

36:35.805 --> 36:38.183
Oh, you got that good good.

36:38.207 --> 36:40.185
- I know. I know.
- Oh.

36:40.209 --> 36:42.588
Oh.

36:42.612 --> 36:43.630
You alright?

36:43.632 --> 36:44.790
I'm good.

36:44.814 --> 36:47.014
- Okay.
- Thank you.

36:47.016 --> 36:49.492
- So, huh?
- What?

36:49.516 --> 36:51.330
What now?

36:51.354 --> 36:52.998
We go back to the casino.

36:53.022 --> 36:55.000
I mean, we still gotta
deal with those freaks.

36:55.024 --> 36:57.699
No, D, I'm not talking
about business, baby.

36:58.227 --> 37:01.437
I'm talking about you and me...
you know, us.

37:01.461 --> 37:03.197
You getting soft on me?

37:03.221 --> 37:04.706
What?

37:05.302 --> 37:07.709
D, I used to be a player.

37:08.171 --> 37:09.999
But I ain't no player no more.

37:10.001 --> 37:11.572
Seriously?

37:11.574 --> 37:13.753
Big Pun is your mack?

37:13.777 --> 37:15.088
D, come on. You're my girl.

37:15.112 --> 37:16.956
We're like Bobby and Whitney.

37:16.980 --> 37:19.224
So I'm a crackhead now?

37:19.248 --> 37:21.026
- No. I'm just...
- What, what?

37:21.050 --> 37:22.895
D, I'm... I'm not good at this.

37:22.919 --> 37:24.851
All I know is I want you in my life.

37:25.188 --> 37:27.086
You forever my lady.

37:29.871 --> 37:31.575
- Jodeci?
- What?

37:31.599 --> 37:33.839
You know you wrong for that.

37:33.863 --> 37:35.363
D, look at me.

37:39.068 --> 37:41.660
I'm serious.
I'm ready to be all-in, babe.

37:43.959 --> 37:45.158
Roller.

37:45.183 --> 37:47.161
- What?
- Come on, now.

37:47.186 --> 37:51.586
Let's just...
Let's keep doing what we doing.

37:52.126 --> 37:55.505
You can keep breaking my back. Yeah?

37:55.530 --> 37:57.926
I gotta take care of myself right now.

37:59.030 --> 38:00.387
You get that?

38:11.168 --> 38:14.480
Deanie. Baby, I got good news.

38:14.504 --> 38:17.817
The man who shot Virginia
has been brought to justice.

38:17.841 --> 38:19.418
By the lawful authorities?

38:19.864 --> 38:21.308
Something like that.

38:21.310 --> 38:22.621
Look, t-the point is,

38:22.645 --> 38:25.491
you don't have to worry
about going after him anymore.

38:25.515 --> 38:28.828
We're safe, baby. We're all safe.

38:28.852 --> 38:30.029
Oh, okay.

38:30.053 --> 38:32.119
'Cause I-I was watching "911,"

38:32.121 --> 38:35.090
and there's just not enough
Angela Bassett to protect us all.

38:36.526 --> 38:39.638
Girl. You are slayin' that eyepatch game.

38:39.662 --> 38:41.440
It's true. I'm thinking
about getting me one.

38:41.464 --> 38:43.376
Bitch, you know you already bought one.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.177
Well, I did, but it's
fuchsia, so I'm not a copycat.

38:46.257 --> 38:49.048
Technically, you... you really
only need one eye.

38:49.072 --> 38:50.337
It's... It's more than sufficient.

38:50.339 --> 38:51.517
- For real?
- Yes, Jennifer.

38:51.541 --> 38:53.140
I'm gonna run your bath.

38:53.142 --> 38:54.854
- Okay, thank you.
- So sweet.

38:54.878 --> 38:57.523
I used your eye to get out
of a date with Ken.

38:57.547 --> 39:00.347
- He's all up on my dick right now.
- Pol!

39:00.349 --> 39:02.149
Y'all, he finna drive me
back to the crazy house.

39:02.151 --> 39:04.063
- Oh, your poor dick.
- Yeah.

39:04.087 --> 39:05.464
You've been using your mental issues

39:05.488 --> 39:07.066
to avoid intimacy for years.

39:07.090 --> 39:08.667
Iyanla alert.

39:08.691 --> 39:10.558
- Wow.
- I ain't being judgy.

39:10.560 --> 39:13.894
- I just... see y'all so clearly now.
- Oh.

39:13.918 --> 39:16.363
It's kind of like the
Clarendon filter on Instagram.

39:16.365 --> 39:18.944
Maybe they let your little ass
out the hospital too soon.

39:18.968 --> 39:20.746
No, I'm fine.

39:20.770 --> 39:23.949
And, Desna, maybe there's
some people you don't trust,

39:23.973 --> 39:26.074
but we got your back.

39:27.189 --> 39:28.234
Good.

39:28.259 --> 39:29.969
'Cause I need y'all's help.

39:29.994 --> 39:32.573
Y'all know I don't trust
those crazy casino people,

39:32.598 --> 39:36.045
but I'm thinking
if we play this hand right,

39:36.253 --> 39:37.585
we can all level up.

39:37.587 --> 39:39.298
- Des!
- I knew it, I knew it.

39:39.322 --> 39:40.499
- I knew it. I knew it, I knew it.
- Hold on, hold on.

39:40.523 --> 39:42.389
I know I put you through
a lot with Zlata.

39:42.391 --> 39:43.703
And Uncle Daddy and Roller.

39:43.727 --> 39:45.682
- But...
- Dr. Ruval and his crazy-ass mama.

39:45.684 --> 39:47.306
- Riva!
- Riva! Riva!

39:47.330 --> 39:50.243
I know. Look, I know, right?

39:50.267 --> 39:53.200
But it is so much money to be made.

39:53.202 --> 39:56.127
What we have now is just the tip.

39:57.378 --> 39:59.506
This is our time, ladies.

40:01.278 --> 40:03.188
Let's secure this bag.

40:03.212 --> 40:04.657
Once we got that power,

40:04.681 --> 40:07.326
ain't nobody gonna mistreat us again.

40:10.620 --> 40:14.021
- J. Boogie, come on.
- Oof.

40:14.023 --> 40:16.135
Come on, little mama.

40:16.159 --> 40:18.804
Brrrr, whoo!

40:36.245 --> 40:37.290
Desna.

40:37.314 --> 40:40.626
And, um, friends.

40:40.650 --> 40:41.760
How can we help you?

40:41.784 --> 40:43.424
We need to talk.

40:44.187 --> 40:46.287
Now.

40:51.060 --> 40:52.159
What are you doing?

40:52.161 --> 40:53.004
She's ripping up a check.

40:53.028 --> 40:54.201
Are you blind, too?

40:54.225 --> 40:55.641
I don't understand.

40:55.642 --> 40:57.888
This was all worked out. We had a deal.

40:57.912 --> 41:00.845
$50,000 is only a fraction of
her dead husband's take,

41:00.847 --> 41:02.024
so y'all are lying.

41:02.048 --> 41:03.359
Busted.

41:03.383 --> 41:07.251
See, I know you're
making bank up in here,

41:07.253 --> 41:09.232
and I came to get my piece.

41:09.256 --> 41:11.255
I can assure you,

41:11.257 --> 41:14.192
your buyout was extremely generous.

41:15.415 --> 41:19.442
Y'all laundering $2 million
a month through the casino.

41:19.466 --> 41:22.979
The beautiful thing is, I don't care.

41:23.003 --> 41:26.849
As long as we get 50%
of what y'all are pulling in.

41:26.873 --> 41:30.120
You're walking into a world of
pain, sweetheart.

41:30.144 --> 41:33.145
Hey! Watch it, asshole.

41:41.221 --> 41:43.489
We'll give you half a million to walk.

41:46.493 --> 41:48.404
Plus Valentino purses for all of you.

41:48.428 --> 41:50.206
The Garavani one with the silver studs?

41:50.230 --> 41:51.608
Ooh, Desna, can we talk about this?

41:51.632 --> 41:52.875
Settle.

41:52.899 --> 41:54.299
Just... Okay.

41:54.301 --> 41:57.213
Me and my girls ain't
going nowhere, bitch.

41:57.237 --> 41:59.103
But we will take them bags.

42:01.708 --> 42:04.020
You can have mine. Word.

42:14.120 --> 42:17.367
Things are about to
turn around for us, ladies.

42:17.391 --> 42:19.836
All those years of being passed over,

42:19.860 --> 42:23.239
lowballed, taken for granted are over.

42:23.263 --> 42:26.442
Bitch, we about to run this town.

44:17.311 --> 44:18.488
Don't shoot.

44:18.512 --> 44:19.956
Hey, watch the shirt, pal!

44:19.980 --> 44:21.313
It's John Varvatos!

44:22.783 --> 44:24.649
Aah!

44:24.651 --> 44:26.984
What... Hey, not so rough.

44:33.594 --> 44:34.859
Yeah.

44:34.861 --> 44:37.240
They bought it was Clint.

44:37.264 --> 44:40.110
Hook, line, and sinker.

44:43.337 --> 44:44.981
You're safe now.

44:48.742 --> 44:50.916
I'm sorry I went rogue, Zaddy.

44:50.918 --> 44:53.055
- Yeah, I know.
- But I saw what Desna did to you.

44:53.079 --> 44:54.279
Yeah, you did.

44:54.281 --> 44:56.264
- Humiliated you.
- She did.

44:56.288 --> 44:57.860
- Took away your manhood.
- She tried.

44:57.884 --> 45:01.864
Made you feel like a minority
in your own country.

45:01.888 --> 45:03.392
I know, baby.

45:04.560 --> 45:06.625
Just don't do it again, okay?
