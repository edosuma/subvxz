Peña and Friedman?

Why don't you just subpoena him
for the trial, Mr. McBride?

04:55.627 --> 04:57.119
- Thank you.
- Your Honor, we believe

04:57.144 --> 04:58.227
that he's a flight risk.

the proof, any proof whatsoever,

05:05.161 --> 05:07.039
that Garcia is connected to the crime?

Where's the proof?

05:09.124 --> 05:11.418
That's something I can't reveal
in open court.

this is not the kind of guy

05:13.628 --> 05:15.213
who respects a subpoena.

05:15.255 --> 05:17.551

on the record

How the hell did that happen?

34:18.826 --> 34:20.578
JEFF: Ah, the federales had him,

34:20.620 --> 34:22.996
and then... disappeared,
I guess. Ambushed or something.

34:23.039 --> 34:24.956
Look, I'm sorry about the bad news,

34:24.998 --> 34:26.417
but we're gonna keep trying, okay?

34:26.458 --> 34:27.918
BILLY: Well, update me, all right?

34:27.960 --> 34:29.504
Thanks, Jeff.

34:29.545 --> 34:31.714
What's wrong?

34:31.755 --> 34:34.132
That was Jeff. They lost Garcia.

34:34.175 --> 34:35.885
Shit.

34:35.927 --> 34:38.029
Okay, here we go.
I want the Cobb salad, right?

34:38.071 --> 34:39.806
Instead of iceberg, I want romaine.

34:39.847 --> 34:41.599
Instead of blue cheese,
I want Parmesan, okay?

34:41.641 --> 34:43.351
- Does it come with bacon?
- Mm-hmm.

34:43.391 --> 34:45.603
- Absolutely no bacon.
- This ain't the Four Seasons.

34:45.645 --> 34:47.647
They bring it how they bring it,
all right?

34:47.688 --> 34:49.483
I like it how I like it,
and I want the vinaigrette

34:49.524 --> 34:51.859
instead of the whatever dressing, okay?

34:51.900 --> 34:53.324
Thank you.

34:55.571 --> 34:57.198
- Coffee.
- Mm-hmm.

34:57.240 --> 34:59.575
So you don't understand because
you don't even like food.

34:59.617 --> 35:02.328
- Yeah, I do.
- Anyway...

35:02.370 --> 35:05.837
And I-I know that you don't want
to talk about this, but...

35:07.333 --> 35:09.836
the plea deal's gonna bite us in the ass.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.802
I'm not letting the kid plea out.

35:14.012 --> 35:16.592
You do understand
that if we don't present it,

35:16.634 --> 35:18.892
we're gonna get disbarred, right?

35:19.512 --> 35:21.889
This kid's been through hell
and back, okay?

35:21.931 --> 35:24.308
I'm not gonna look him
in the eye and say,

35:24.350 --> 35:27.295
"I know you didn't do it, but
go to jail for 11 years anyway."

35:27.337 --> 35:29.730
Well, we don't even know
if he's innocent.

35:29.772 --> 35:31.649
- I won't do it.
- Why?

35:31.691 --> 35:33.693
I told you why.

35:35.903 --> 35:38.406
(SIGHS)

35:40.199 --> 35:41.593
All right, so do you know what it means

35:41.635 --> 35:43.369
to plea to voluntary manslaughter?

35:43.411 --> 35:44.914
- No, not really.
- Okay.

35:44.955 --> 35:48.082
So what it is is that...
you'd be agreeing

35:48.124 --> 35:50.084
to say that you killed Marcos and Hunter,

35:50.126 --> 35:51.919
but that you didn't plan it.

35:51.961 --> 35:54.149
Right? That it was
in the heat of the moment.

35:54.191 --> 35:56.711
Um, so with that deal,
you're looking at 11 years.

35:56.752 --> 35:59.599
Uh, with good behavior,
you could be out in seven.

36:00.178 --> 36:01.256
Is that clear?

36:01.298 --> 36:05.057
So you... you think
I should take the deal?

36:05.897 --> 36:07.602
Uh, well...

36:07.643 --> 36:09.312
(UNDER BREATH): Do we want to take it?

36:09.353 --> 36:10.980
- Um...
- (SLAPS HAND ON TABLE)

36:11.022 --> 36:13.663
Yeah. Yeah, if you did it,

36:13.704 --> 36:15.026
I think it's the best-case scenario.

36:15.067 --> 36:16.652
- Yes.
- But I didn't kill them.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.654
Right, you didn't kill them.

36:18.696 --> 36:20.990
- Okay. Yeah.
- I didn't.

36:25.202 --> 36:27.288
Okay, so you tell me

36:27.300 --> 36:30.413
why the cops just found
the murder weapon at your house.

36:30.454 --> 36:33.139
I don't know anything about
that. That's the truth.

36:33.181 --> 36:35.085
Right. And you had the gun
in the video why?

36:35.127 --> 36:37.853
That's not the gun
from the video. It can't be.

36:40.515 --> 36:42.190
What are you talking about?

36:43.852 --> 36:45.944
I lied to you about something else.

36:46.989 --> 36:48.360
Okay.

36:48.402 --> 36:50.365
Sorry. I just thought you and
Mr. McBride were gonna get...

36:50.407 --> 36:51.908
I don't care.

36:54.953 --> 36:56.115
The gun I had,

36:56.140 --> 36:58.164
- the one that was in the video...
- Mm-hmm.

36:58.206 --> 37:00.952
...I didn't throw it
in the ocean like I said.

37:02.245 --> 37:04.504
I gave it to my girlfriend to hold onto.

37:04.914 --> 37:06.506
Why wouldn't you just give it to us?

37:06.548 --> 37:08.258
I-I don't understand that.

37:08.300 --> 37:09.759
Because it was my brother's.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.971
I don't know what he used it for, but...

37:13.798 --> 37:14.975
I was just worried

37:15.017 --> 37:17.434
that it was gonna get me
into even more trouble.

37:23.391 --> 37:25.358
Where's Mr. McBride?

37:27.277 --> 37:29.022
Yeah, he couldn't make it.

37:34.444 --> 37:35.774
BRITTANY: Can I just be honest
with you guys?

37:35.816 --> 37:37.508

is so goddamn hard.
