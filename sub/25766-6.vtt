00:02.419 --> 00:04.251
I always wondered what was up

00:04.379 --> 00:05.915
with this creepy building.

00:06.048 --> 00:09.667
Welcome to The Guild
of Calamitous Intent.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.133
Ta-da!

00:11.261 --> 00:13.674
Please step on the grating
and put these on.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.137
Have you eaten breakfast?

00:15.265 --> 00:16.381
- No.
- Not yet.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.385
Good.

00:24.066 --> 00:27.559
Here she is...
Guild Strategic Operations.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.651
Research and development,
agent training,

00:29.780 --> 00:33.069
covert undertakings,
scams, shams, and "oh, damns"...

00:33.200 --> 00:35.066
This is where it all goes down.

00:35.202 --> 00:38.411
Every one of these doors
leads into the future

00:38.539 --> 00:39.996
of organized evil.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.080
Shut the fuckin' door!

00:42.209 --> 00:44.997
E-Except for that door.
That's the men's room.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.335
Ladies' room!

00:53.512 --> 00:55.094
- I-It's not what it looks like!
- Dude!

00:55.222 --> 00:56.554
You have the wrong door again.

00:56.682 --> 00:59.470
<i>- Right</i> door.
- This is the B.T.C.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.685
Blackmail Training Center.
These women are Guild agents.

01:02.813 --> 01:05.897
And that man has the job
I apply for every year.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.890
And denied.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.312
The S.A.C...
the Surgical Alteration Center.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.404
Here, after multiple
surgical processes,

01:14.533 --> 01:16.320
we alter our agents
to take the place

01:16.451 --> 01:18.534
of the world's
most powerful people.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.909
Dave Grohl?

01:22.040 --> 01:23.827
You made a guy into Dave Grohl?

01:23.959 --> 01:25.871
Nobody refuses Dave Grohl.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.120
He got a Beatle
to be in his band.

01:28.255 --> 01:31.214
And King Diamond!
<i>You</i> try that, smartass.

01:32.217 --> 01:35.631
The Guild H.T.C...
Hypnosis Training Center.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.220
Here we train agents in the use
of our own method

01:38.348 --> 01:39.464
of speed induction.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.466
Hypnosis doesn't really work.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.138
Oh, yeah.
It's a complete myth.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.102
Sleep!

01:49.401 --> 01:51.267
- No way. Screw this!
- Relax!

01:51.403 --> 01:54.521
This is the H.T.C...
the Hologram Training Center.

01:54.656 --> 01:55.656
Observe.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.903
These are harmless
projected imag...

01:58.035 --> 01:59.822
Okay. No. This is real.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.161
Wait. No.
This is the V.A.T.C.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.155
The Vicious Animal
Training Center.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.954
Who's a good ocelot?

02:08.086 --> 02:11.796
Let's just leave really slowly.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.041
See? We really need to
label these doors.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.507
This the Guild
Interrogation Hub.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.633
What, it's not the G.I.H.?

02:20.766 --> 02:22.382
No.
Why would it be that?

02:22.517 --> 02:24.634
So, anything interest you?

02:24.770 --> 02:26.727
We were looking more
for fieldwork...

02:26.855 --> 02:28.642
you know,
something to help us level up.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.694
The best thing for that
is to be a good "earner."

02:30.734 --> 02:35.445
You bring in looted technology,
intel, severed heads, cash.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.484
Oh, there's the Big Villain
program.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.152
Tutor a Guild newbie for a day,

02:39.284 --> 02:41.571
get massive brownie points
at your review board.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.286
I don't know. Maybe?
I... Who do I got to tutor?

02:44.414 --> 02:48.533
Uh, the only one available today
is St. Cloud.

02:48.669 --> 02:49.785
Level one.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.084
Arching Billy Quizboy
and the Pink Pilgrim.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.298
Dude!
They work for Venture!

02:55.425 --> 02:57.462
It's big-headed Billy
and that albino guy.

02:57.594 --> 02:58.960
We got to do this.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.429
Sweet!
We are so in.

03:01.556 --> 03:04.219
- Ooh. Sorry.
- Please do not touch anything.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.718
Hey, that's my wife.
Hi, sweetness!

03:06.853 --> 03:08.890
That's secret Guild business,
Mr. Monarch.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.935
Let's get you
to your Little Villain.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.518
We can make this
nice and comfortable for you.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.965
You just confess to being a
member of the Peril Partnership,

03:17.989 --> 03:20.697
and you're a double agent
for the Guild by lunchtime.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.488
I'm buying.
Turkey subs?

03:22.619 --> 03:24.360
And if I don't?

03:24.496 --> 03:26.579
Well, that's treason.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.289
The punishment for that
is a classic.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.624
It's called the tub.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.208
It's filled with milk.
You lay in it.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.980
if you're hungry,
we pour honey on your face.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.371
That sounds kind of nice,
actually.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.749
At first...
you know, till the milk spoils.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.841
Soon the tub fills
with your excrement,

03:39.970 --> 03:42.428
then the flies
and their maggots.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.888
At first it itches a bit.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.597
Then it starts to burn.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.093
Your skin peels away
with every scratch

03:48.228 --> 03:50.470
you can't stop yourself
from making.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.769
The blood mixes with
the foul milk and excrement,

03:53.900 --> 03:55.857
seeping into your open wounds.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.353
The smell of your own death
causes you to vomit

03:58.488 --> 04:00.855
into your already-toxic coffin.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.107
Then the rats.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.983
Oh, right.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.202
Yeah.
The Peril Partnership.

04:06.329 --> 04:09.663
Is that what you're... Yes.
Let's talk about them.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.578
He owns the X-2?

04:15.714 --> 04:18.707
How the hell is this guy
only a Level One antagonist?

04:18.841 --> 04:20.925
Right? The X-2?

04:21.052 --> 04:23.089
I haven't been aboard this thing
in years.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.383
It's like visiting
the house you grew up in...

04:25.515 --> 04:27.677
if you, like,
buried a dead guy behind it.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.971
Ugh.
So eerily familiar.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.423
You know what looks familiar?

04:31.521 --> 04:35.310
That. That's Blue Thunder.
Roy Scheider flew that!

04:35.442 --> 04:38.276
Dude, remember how ripped he was
in "Marathon Man"?

04:38.403 --> 04:39.735
He was like Bruce Lee.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.071
Friggin' Roy Scheider,
"Jaws" dad.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.656
Secret six-pack.
Who knew?

04:43.784 --> 04:46.026
Ahoy, gentlemen.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.902
Welcome aboard the X-2,

04:48.038 --> 04:50.371
as seen on
"The Rusty Venture Show."

04:50.499 --> 04:52.365
Ah.
Uh, hello, there, uh, son.

04:52.501 --> 04:55.335
Uh, do you know
where Mr. St. Cloud is?

04:55.462 --> 04:57.044
Oh, goody!

04:57.172 --> 04:59.505
I'm being hazed
by my Big Villain.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.876
I wore my rubber panties
just in case you tickle me.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.298
I always make wee-wee
with tickles.

05:06.890 --> 05:10.509
Are you fucking kidding me?
That's St. Cloud?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.762
I brought crullers!

05:14.898 --> 05:17.231
And one apple fritter
that's mine.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.271
And two of the crullers are mine
as well.

05:19.402 --> 05:21.109
- Where are you guys?
- Freeze!

05:21.238 --> 05:23.321
All right.
Prove that you're the real Doc.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.610
This is totally a laser gun.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.701
No.
And what is that, a caulk gun?

05:28.829 --> 05:31.037
Show him what we got in the mail
this morning.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.705
"Welcome to your demise,"
yada, yada, yada...

05:36.837 --> 05:39.580
Mm-hmm.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.001
Yeah. You guys, this is
a boilerplate Guild threat.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.125
- Please.
- I tried to tell him that.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.253
Liar! You were as freaked
as I am, White!

05:46.388 --> 05:48.755
Billy, it's a scroll.
Hello?

05:48.890 --> 05:50.368
It's like being scared
of a book report

05:50.392 --> 05:51.849
on the Declaration
of Independence.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.390
Did you not read the part
that mentioned disemboweling?

05:54.521 --> 05:56.979
It personally threatens
my intestines!

05:58.400 --> 05:59.857
Come in, Brock.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.898
We have a Level One
Guild arching threat.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.049
So? What do you want,
an aspirin or something?

06:05.073 --> 06:06.735
See?
It's nothing.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.985
Where do you keep the caulk?
I got to load this bad boy.

06:10.579 --> 06:13.492
Just keep an eye on basic
Peril Partnership operations.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.081
You're more like a concerned
friend than a spy.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.998
And you'll help me
with my problem?

06:20.130 --> 06:23.123
Sign it, and I'll do everything
I can...

06:23.258 --> 06:25.966
So you don't want to talk,
huh, punky pal?

06:26.094 --> 06:27.380
Does a cat have your tongue?

06:27.512 --> 06:30.596
Well, I am just the dog to get
that cat off of your tongue!

06:30.724 --> 06:33.683
Where is the disrupter ray,
Mr. Think You're Tough Guy?

06:33.810 --> 06:35.096
What are you talking about?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.560
He's agreed to work with us

06:36.688 --> 06:38.304
if we help him get
his girlfriend back.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.681
Help get his girlfriend back?

06:39.816 --> 06:41.853
Is this interrogation room 8C?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.942
This is room 8B.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.481
My mistake.

06:45.614 --> 06:46.614
You have no need

06:46.740 --> 06:49.357
of my super-intimidating
bad-cop routine.

06:49.492 --> 06:52.405
What <i>you</i> need... is a makeover!

06:54.000 --> 07:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:22.943 --> 07:24.935
Then we all get milkshakes!

07:25.528 --> 07:27.288
- We're not going.
- I don't want to do that.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.406
Look at all this stuff!

07:31.534 --> 07:34.151
That's the 1973 "Sigmund
and the Sea Monster" suit.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.654
Where did he get this?

07:37.374 --> 07:39.161
I like his albino.
Quiet.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.624
You should take notes
on this guy.

07:40.752 --> 07:44.587
Ta-da!
My snazzy villain ensemble.

07:44.714 --> 07:47.297
- Uh, I don't get it.
- No. No. He's a lightning cloud.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.257
You know... St. Cloud?
Cloud hat?

07:49.386 --> 07:52.174
Should it be tighter,
mm, sexier?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.921
Oh, God, no!
It's already...

07:54.057 --> 07:56.891
Okay. No... It's a start.
So, what's your weaponry, huh?

07:57.018 --> 07:59.510
Can you lay down,
like, a blinding smoke cloud,

07:59.646 --> 08:01.888
or does lightning
come from your hat?

08:02.023 --> 08:03.889
These are made of foam core.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.687
Do you have any superpowers?

08:05.819 --> 08:09.312
Like, you know, were you bit by
a radioactive bug or anything?

08:09.447 --> 08:13.191
Mm, well, I do have lupus,
fibromyalgia,

08:13.326 --> 08:14.988
and restless leg syndrome.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.362
Well, maybe we can work
with the restless leg?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.988
- Stop!
- Super restless leg.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.410
- That's dumb.
- All right. Fine.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.158
So you have
no special abilities?

08:22.293 --> 08:24.080
- I have money.
- Perfect!

08:24.212 --> 08:26.750
We'll get a top-of-the-line
lightning rifle, and, uh...

08:26.881 --> 08:29.089
Cloud bombs
loaded with nerve gas.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.174
Level One, dude.
Level One.

08:31.302 --> 08:34.794
Cloud bombs with laughing gas.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.888
Billy!

08:37.017 --> 08:39.054
Let's go in there.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.268
Come on! You can't hide
in the can all day.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.808
I got a belly full of crullers
and a delicate colon.

08:43.940 --> 08:44.976
Let's go!

08:45.108 --> 08:47.475
There are like 10 bathrooms
in this...

08:47.610 --> 08:48.817
Ow.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.402
- You're dead.
- What the hell?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.613
- I thought we were in time-out!
- I told you this...

08:52.741 --> 08:54.903
Never be standing
behind the door you open.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.573
It could've been a killbot with
my voice programmed into it.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.070
I actually made one of those.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.572
His name was Guardo,
and he could've just killed you.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.200
Behind every door is a threat.
Every sound is a warning.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.827
Every shadow is a villain.
Every step is a...

09:06.963 --> 09:08.579
Aah.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.674
- How in the hell did you...
- Billy looked at you.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.463
I'm armed,
but my back is still turned.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.133
You're only wounded.
Come at me, hand to hand.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.927
Keep low. Break my balance.
If you have an edge weapon...

09:19.059 --> 09:20.675
He just ran away, didn't he?

09:20.810 --> 09:23.302
Oh, yeah.
I'm pretty sure he was crying.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.431
More smoke!

09:27.108 --> 09:29.020
Now throw your catchphrase!

09:29.611 --> 09:31.443
Look out, do-gooders.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.982
Use the P.A.!

09:33.114 --> 09:34.901
You're supposed to be big
and scary!

09:35.033 --> 09:36.033
Reset!

09:36.034 --> 09:38.367
I hope you brought rubbers,

09:38.495 --> 09:40.578
because a storm is coming.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.072
That's nasty...
and not even a little scary.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.746
- Rubbers?
- Uh, rain booties.

09:45.877 --> 09:48.085
Don't improvise!
Reset!

09:48.213 --> 09:51.251
Hey, what flavor is this fog?

09:51.382 --> 09:53.669
- It's making me hungry.
- Pineapple!

09:53.802 --> 09:57.341
Now come out of the smoke
and give your evil laugh.

09:57.472 --> 10:00.135
Over here!
You're facing the wrong way!

10:00.266 --> 10:02.132
The fog is disorienting.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.475
Evil laugh!

10:03.603 --> 10:07.017
I will get you.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.765
What the hell was that?
Are you having an asthma attack?

10:09.901 --> 10:11.358
That was my evil laugh.

10:11.486 --> 10:12.522
Oh, disgusting.

10:12.654 --> 10:15.067
I mean, it's scary,
but in, like, that gross way.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.862
You need a real, from-the-gut,
bone crusher of a laugh.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.734
Reset!
Real evil laugh!

10:20.870 --> 10:22.611
Do <i>not</i> embarrass me
in front of Venture!

10:22.747 --> 10:25.455
Mwuah-ha-ha-ha-ha...
Mm.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.291
Ew! Will you stop putting
that weird groan at the end?

10:28.419 --> 10:31.457
Here. Listen to a pro.
Show him an evil laugh.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.797
Gladly.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.094
Reset!

10:50.692 --> 10:52.684
Don't put on the kettle.
I'm not staying.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.435
Just got to pick my clubs.

10:54.571 --> 10:55.857
What the hell
are <i>you</i> doing here?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.901
Shh.
Brock is training us to fight.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.991
So I'm doing what I do best,
which is to secretly cower.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.577
Oh.
Hey, that reminds me.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.072
- Damn it!
- Ha!

11:06.207 --> 11:08.494
I said trust nobody!

11:10.837 --> 11:12.669
Ugh.
I want this car so bad.

11:12.797 --> 11:13.958
I know you do.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.457
So, ready to pull
your first P.E.N.I.S.?

11:16.593 --> 11:18.380
That sounds unappetizing.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.252
Oh, no.
P.E.N.I.S. is just an acronym.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.631
For Preliminary Effective
New Information Schooling.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.133
It's like recon,
but, uh, you bust shit up.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.932
Then why not call it recon
instead of P.E.N.I.S.?

11:29.063 --> 11:31.555
- Instead of what?
- Instead of P.E.N.I.S.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.023
Of what?

11:33.151 --> 11:35.234
- Of P.E.N.I.S.
- I can't hear you back there.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.148
P.E.N.I.S. I said P.E.N.I.S.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.397
P.E.N.I.S.!

11:42.035 --> 11:44.493
Yeah. the O.S.I. never changes
their passwords.

11:44.621 --> 11:48.615
And boom, here she is...
Agent Kimberly McManus.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.161
Ooh-la-luscious!

11:50.293 --> 11:52.250
Way to go, S-464.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.335
Ladies do love exposed brains.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.376
How do you know
what she looks like?

11:56.507 --> 11:58.749
That's melt-in-your-mouth code
we're looking at.

11:58.885 --> 11:59.966
She's working daycare...

12:00.094 --> 12:02.882
Level One arches, surveillance,
intervention.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.597
Do we have any Level One arches
scheduled today?

12:05.725 --> 12:08.138
One... Augustus St. Cloud.

12:08.269 --> 12:11.012
He just put in a requisition
for a Level One lightning rifle

12:11.147 --> 12:12.558
and laughing gas grenades.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.272
And he paid in cash.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.608
- Dolla dolla bills, my brotha.
- All right.

12:16.736 --> 12:20.229
Uh, upgrade the lightning rifle
to Level Six and send it out.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.858
Mm. Six-level lightning.
That should get her attention.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.326
She'll have to intervene
on a treaty violation.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.821
So will we.
And you will get your lady back.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.573
Isn't that, like, dangerous?

12:30.708 --> 12:32.665
We're The Guild
of Calamitous Intent.

12:32.794 --> 12:36.128
We're the bad guys.
Own it, gentlemen.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.966
ST.
- Enh...

12:41.094 --> 12:43.177
Ow.

12:45.431 --> 12:49.641
I am Augustus St. Cloud,
archnemesis of the Quizboy.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.557
I'm here to bust things up
and chew bubble gum,

12:52.689 --> 12:55.306
and I find bubble gum
unpleasant.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.558
Oh, laddy boy.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.936
You chose the wrong place
to talk tough.

13:00.071 --> 13:02.404
Rose? Rose, dear?

13:02.532 --> 13:04.319
There's a wee little pest
in here!

13:04.450 --> 13:06.316
You're stronger
than anticipated.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.444
Oh, they're just water bugs,
Horace.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.741
Honestly!
Oh, hello there.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.081
He says he's here
to bust things up.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.997
Apparently he's
your son's nemesis.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.870
You want to hurt my Billy?

13:18.006 --> 13:19.338
Horace, put him down.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.798
Mama bear wants a piece
of that action.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.885
Oh, you're in for quite
the pummeling there, sonny.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.800
I'll let you take
the first swing,

13:26.931 --> 13:28.422
and if you don't put me down,

13:28.558 --> 13:30.720
I'll beat the living shit
out of you

13:30.852 --> 13:32.718
till my arthritis kicks in.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.642
And I just took my Humira.

13:49.579 --> 13:52.242
Ugh.
Who the hell is this now?

13:52.373 --> 13:53.989
Didn't you say I'm clear
for a while?

13:54.125 --> 13:55.661
This isn't for you.
It's for them.

13:55.793 --> 13:58.831
I'm sorry! I had to put
this place down as our sanctum.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.795
My place is filled
with helpless old people.

14:00.923 --> 14:01.923
What does it say?

14:02.008 --> 14:05.126
"I will get you.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.298
Mruu-haha."

14:07.430 --> 14:08.796
Who's Mruu-haha?

14:08.931 --> 14:11.048
It's an evil laugh, Billy.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.971
Wait a minute.
That's exactly how The Monarch

14:13.102 --> 14:16.186
spells his evil laugh...
with the stupid M-R and two U's.

14:16.314 --> 14:17.850
You think that's a coincidence?

14:17.982 --> 14:19.974
I think it just got personal.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.898
Boys, get your coats on.
We're stepping up our game.

14:27.784 --> 14:31.448
Pei put makeup on me.
How does it look?

14:31.579 --> 14:33.571
Less like an old woman
beat your face,

14:33.706 --> 14:36.744
but more like if Michael Kors
worked at the Wonka factory.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.118
Mm. Goody.
So, what's in the case?

14:39.253 --> 14:42.837
That, my Little Villain,
is your new lightning rifle.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.048
21, why don't you tell him
what six figures gets you

14:45.176 --> 14:46.633
at the Guild company store?

14:46.761 --> 14:49.094
Rubberized titanium stock
and hand guard,

14:49.222 --> 14:50.508
air-assisted charging handle,

14:50.640 --> 14:53.348
activation bolt,
energy magazine release.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.593
Gives you 10 Level One-rated
blasts,

14:55.728 --> 14:57.344
regulated here
at the ejection port.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.938
Balance at the handle, which
doubles as a rear sight drum.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.058
And that's all the cookies
I need to sell

15:02.193 --> 15:03.900
to get my merit badge.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.145
Here. Give her a go.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.897
Owie.
I landed on my bum-bum.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.033
Ugh.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.071
Help him up and get him changed
for his arching.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.490
Damn it.
It was so cool until then.

15:15.957 --> 15:17.493
Four months?!

15:17.625 --> 15:20.584
We need these costumes tonight,
like in a couple hours!

15:20.711 --> 15:22.247
Oh, you no just-a steal suits

15:22.380 --> 15:25.214
like-a this beautiful rogue
here?

15:25.341 --> 15:27.298
Ah! Enzo no stay mad.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.043
Rusty good man... mostly.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.716
Enzo.
Enzo?

15:31.848 --> 15:34.807
You don't have any old rentals
for special friends?

15:34.934 --> 15:37.927
You play-a Enzo's heartstrings!
Okay!

15:38.062 --> 15:40.224
For the pink man, yes,
but for him?

15:40.356 --> 15:41.892
He's like a bambino!

15:42.024 --> 15:45.688
Oh, but his head is like
big strong man,

15:45.820 --> 15:47.732
like a man
maybe six meters tall.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.230
<i>Molto grande!</i>

15:49.365 --> 15:50.697
I'll pay double rental.

15:50.825 --> 15:54.489
I want these guys invincible for
their first New York arching.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.954
Oh! First-a time?
So exciting.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.243
I set you up.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.082
But Enzo no hear that!

16:01.210 --> 16:03.623
Enzo, he know nothing.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.876
Hey, move that thing
out of here, buddy!

16:11.012 --> 16:13.550
Not gonna happen, pal.
The engine died.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.344
Will you take West 56th already?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.843
Agent McManus in position.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.223
Level One arches
are so cush these days.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.770
They never blocked traffic
for us when we were coming up.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.702
I smell pineapple.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.901
It is showtime.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.240
Should we go watch now?

16:34.368 --> 16:36.860
Mm. Yeah.
After I finish this latte.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.282
It was $9.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.703
Nine.
For a latte.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.710
Ugh.
Come on!

16:45.838 --> 16:47.204
You got to get out there!

16:47.340 --> 16:50.174
No way! I'm not wearing this!

16:50.301 --> 16:52.418
Billy, from 1962 till puberty,

16:52.553 --> 16:54.840
Delta Boy of Venus kicked ass
in that suit.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.304
It's nigh impenetrable.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.970
Now get out there
and kick some ass!

16:59.101 --> 17:00.967
It can't be any worse
than White's.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.103
Seriously.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.183
I really thought a guy
called Killer Drone

17:04.315 --> 17:05.977
would've had a cooler costume.

17:08.109 --> 17:11.194
Wow.
You look like a real superhero.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.188
You look like a can
of Diet Pepsi.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.816
At least I don't look like the
girl from the Blind Melon video.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.443
Well, her stinger
didn't shoot darts,

17:17.578 --> 17:19.569
and her wings
didn't actually work.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.913
Huh? Huh?

17:22.040 --> 17:23.531
Yeah. Okay.
These don't either.

17:23.667 --> 17:28.378
Billy Quizboy,
A storm is coming for you.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.418
Put on your rubbers.
Mm.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.382
Oh. So close.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.752
My God!
Don't improvise!

17:34.887 --> 17:37.129
Hear my thunder.

17:37.265 --> 17:38.927
Fear my lightning.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.026
W-What do we do? I don't have
any weapons or anything.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.234
Don't worry!

17:52.363 --> 17:53.945
White shoots darts
from his butt.

17:54.073 --> 17:58.283
Your job is to give
a heroic speech.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.744
Now get out there
and do me proud.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.162
It's Level One, Billy.
It's a show.

18:03.291 --> 18:06.125
He stuns you, you stun him,
he vows revenge,

18:06.252 --> 18:09.370
and then you tell him that good
always triumphs over evil.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.121
- Does it?
- Of course not.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.214
Now get out there
and get this crap over with.

18:13.342 --> 18:14.878
You're blocking traffic.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.924
Oh, and he's taken out
like it's trash day.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.466
Swing and a miss!

18:19.599 --> 18:21.966
Way to go, Venture!
Love the costumes!

18:22.101 --> 18:24.935
They look nothing like you
rescued them from Lidsville!

18:25.062 --> 18:28.601
Oh! He's coming out!
And he's facing the right way!

18:28.733 --> 18:30.975
Oh, you brought your albino?

18:31.110 --> 18:33.352
Coward.
I left mine at home.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.023
I'm not <i>his</i> albino.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.988
People don't own albinos!

18:37.116 --> 18:38.982
Eat my darts, St. Cloud!

18:40.536 --> 18:43.074
Ugh.
So undignified.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.992
Were we this bad
when we started?

18:45.583 --> 18:48.291
Agent McManus, O.S.I.
I'm shutting this down.

18:48.419 --> 18:51.878
I have suspicions that your man
has an unregistered rifle.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.965
Kimberly.
It's me... S-464.

18:55.092 --> 18:58.005
Oh, fantastic.
You're on daycare duty, too?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.628
Perfect.
Just great.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.175
And in the darkest night,

19:01.307 --> 19:03.924
even when you can't find
a flashlight that isn't, like,

19:04.060 --> 19:08.725
out of batteries or something,
good always prevails over evil.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.848
Take this, Quizboy.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.650
Oh. Oh.

19:14.779 --> 19:18.739
Evil laugh fail
<i>and</i> he's just gassed himself.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.483
Ah. Geez.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.656
What...
What's my wife doing here?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.620
W-What the hell?

19:29.752 --> 19:31.869
Is this laughing gas?
You... You moron!

19:32.004 --> 19:34.191
St. Cloud!

19:34.215 --> 19:37.333
You asshole!
It's go time!

19:37.468 --> 19:40.085
Oh, I'm so woozy.
White?

19:40.221 --> 19:42.804
I'm gonna puke
in my Delta Boy suit.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.972
Who has my rifle?

19:48.104 --> 19:51.347
The Peril Partnership are scum.
Honorless scum!

19:51.482 --> 19:53.565
I said I was done with you,
and I meant it!

19:53.693 --> 19:55.980
Oh, my God.
Will you give him a chance?

19:56.112 --> 19:57.148
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

19:57.279 --> 20:00.067
- Uh, excuse me?
- You heard me.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.407
Uh, listen, you O.S.I. lackey.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.822
I will wipe the floor
with your fat trucker ass.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.321
I don't care if he loves you,
set all this up,

20:07.456 --> 20:09.789
and is helping us spy on the
Peril Partnership all for you,

20:09.917 --> 20:13.410
'cause I am going to kick
the shit out of you.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.128
You're a double agent?

20:15.256 --> 20:17.168
You did all this for me?

20:17.299 --> 20:18.944
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- No, no, no!

20:18.968 --> 20:20.254
Screw this happy-ending crap!

20:20.386 --> 20:21.877
This bitch is gonna get
a beatdown.

20:22.012 --> 20:24.755
Uh... Councilwoman Smith!

20:24.890 --> 20:26.722
I'm so glad
you answered my call.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.309
My Little Villain had a mishap
with his rifle.

20:29.437 --> 20:30.553
Why don't you two take off?

20:30.688 --> 20:32.429
There's gonna be
tons of paperwork,

20:32.565 --> 20:34.648
and, uh, there's no reason
to ruin all our nights.

20:34.775 --> 20:35.856
We will handle this.

20:36.444 --> 20:38.880
You would've lost your seat on
the council if you'd fought her.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.317
Thanks. You saved my life.

20:41.449 --> 20:44.738
No, I saved your job.
I just saved <i>that</i> woman's life.

20:44.869 --> 20:48.078
You would've kicked her ass!

21:16.025 --> 21:17.982
So he shoots me
with his rifle, right?

21:18.110 --> 21:19.588
And I thought, "I'm dead.
This is it."

21:19.612 --> 21:20.612
Me too!

21:20.613 --> 21:23.151
There were all these sparks
flying around him.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.319
But the suit, the giant suit,
it absorbs the blast,

21:25.451 --> 21:26.692
and there I am, still standing.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.587
And then I started
kicking him, right?

21:28.704 --> 21:30.991
Like "Goodfellas" style,
just... just whalin' on him.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.160
Beatin' on his rib cage
with his foot.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.783
Go get your damn shine box,
St. Cloud!

21:34.919 --> 21:37.332
White is just goin'
at his rib cage like it's...

21:37.463 --> 21:39.383
- like there's money in it.
- Right? Oh, totally!

21:39.423 --> 21:40.539
We housed him!

21:42.218 --> 21:44.005
When, uh, when are you
gonna tell 'em

21:44.136 --> 21:46.048
that they were hallucinating
on nitrous

21:46.180 --> 21:50.845
and, uh, we found the three
of them asleep in a little pile?

21:50.976 --> 21:52.092
Never.

21:55.523 --> 21:56.855
P.E.N.I.S.
