00:05.375 --> 00:07.250
Keep it straight. That's it.

00:07.333 --> 00:08.291
That's it, Clay.

00:08.375 --> 00:10.959
Atta boy. Keep it straight.

00:11.041 --> 00:13.375
That's it, pedal
a little faster.

00:13.458 --> 00:15.166
- Straight.
- Ah.

00:15.250 --> 00:16.375
Doing good, Clay.

00:16.458 --> 00:18.250
Keep your head up. Hang on.

00:18.333 --> 00:19.500
Lean forward.

00:19.583 --> 00:21.500
Faster, faster, Clay.

00:21.583 --> 00:22.583
- You got it.
- Don't let go!

00:22.667 --> 00:24.083
That's it, you got it.

00:24.166 --> 00:26.417
You got it, Clay. You got it.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.417
- Dad!
- Steer.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.709
(male #1)
'Yeah.'

00:29.792 --> 00:31.083
Ugh!

00:34.542 --> 00:37.667
- 'Whoa.'
- Ugh.

00:37.750 --> 00:41.583
- You had it there for a
second.
- Ugh! Aah!

00:41.667 --> 00:43.250
- Are you okay, honey?
- He's okay.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.625
- Mitch, maybe you should
take--
- He's fine.

00:45.709 --> 00:47.000
(male #1)
'You're okay, there, champ.'

00:47.083 --> 00:48.208
You just gotta walk it off.

00:48.291 --> 00:49.625
I told you not to let go.

00:49.709 --> 00:52.250
Trust me, Clay,
this is the only way to learn.

00:52.333 --> 00:54.667
- No, I can't do it.
- Sure, you can.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.125
(male #1)
'You just gotta get
back on the horse.'

00:56.208 --> 00:58.542
No, I don't,
and it's not a
horse.

00:58.625 --> 01:00.542
Come on, I'll be
right behind you.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.125
Promise I won't let
anything bad happen.

01:02.208 --> 01:03.709
I want the
training
wheels back on.

01:07.166 --> 01:10.250
Hey, whatever you want, buddy.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.083
You're the one who said
you didn't want to be

01:13.166 --> 01:15.959
the last of your pals riding
around with training wheels.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.333
I'll give it another shot.

01:21.417 --> 01:24.208
But only if you don't
let go until I say so.

01:27.208 --> 01:28.875
Deal. Let's go.

01:28.959 --> 01:30.417
Come on.

01:30.500 --> 01:33.333
Okay, wanna pedal
faster this time.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.500
Pedal faster.

01:35.583 --> 01:37.500
Look straight. You can do it.

01:37.583 --> 01:39.000
- Pedal faster.
- Don't let go.

01:39.083 --> 01:40.834
Little faster. Come on.

01:40.917 --> 01:44.625
Come on, Clay. That's it,
that's it. Steer, Clay.

01:44.709 --> 01:46.583
- Dad!
- Steer.

01:46.667 --> 01:49.291
I'm doing it!
I'm doing it, Dad!

01:51.417 --> 01:53.333
- Oh, gosh.
- Backwards, Clay.

01:53.417 --> 01:54.583
Brakes!

01:54.667 --> 01:56.083
Clay, backwards!

01:56.166 --> 01:57.917
Clay! Slow down! Ha ha.

02:01.542 --> 02:04.000
(male #1)
Clay!

02:42.625 --> 02:44.250
What's up with the fresh job?

02:44.333 --> 02:47.417
Some joker took a
header
off a high-rise last
night.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.250
They yanked us
out of bed for a jumper?

02:49.333 --> 02:51.667
The boss is already here.

02:53.583 --> 02:55.667
That's gotta be 20 stories up.

02:55.750 --> 02:57.542
Guy's a pizza.

02:57.625 --> 02:59.000
If he's still in one piece.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.375
It was nice of him
to beat rush hour.

03:01.458 --> 03:04.375
Victim's a Harold Dixon, 55.

03:08.875 --> 03:10.542
We got called for a suicide?

03:10.625 --> 03:13.250
Wasn't a suicide.
Hands are bound.

03:13.333 --> 03:15.500
Plastic ties.

03:15.583 --> 03:16.917
Bound?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.750
You're saying
the guy was pushed?

03:18.834 --> 03:20.959
He was a registered
sex offender.

03:21.041 --> 03:23.792
Aw, that's a damn shame.

03:23.875 --> 03:26.750
Found this note stuffed
in his pocket from the doer.

03:29.458 --> 03:32.041
"I'm gonna take out
a piece of garbage

03:32.125 --> 03:34.625
"every day till you
solve the murder of my son.

03:34.709 --> 03:36.125
"Clayton Hathaway."

03:37.583 --> 03:40.166
Looks like we're gonna
need a few more garbage bags.

03:42.041 --> 03:43.709
Missed the dumpster.

04:19.208 --> 04:20.834
(Scotty)
Six-year-old Clayton Hathaway.

04:20.917 --> 04:23.250
Snatched off his bike
back in 1987.

04:23.333 --> 04:24.750
Found two days later raped

04:24.834 --> 04:26.542
strangled, bike
was never
recovered.

04:26.625 --> 04:28.709
(John)
'Kid disappeared
on the dad's watch.'

04:28.792 --> 04:30.125
Mitch Hathaway.

04:30.208 --> 04:32.333
A police zeroed in on
the father after the
body

04:32.417 --> 04:34.458
was found at a
construction
site he was developing.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.917
Traces of semen matched
his father's blood type.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.125
Even the wife checked
out on him at the trial.

04:39.208 --> 04:40.375
Guilty till proven innocent.

04:40.458 --> 04:41.959
Jury didn't take long.
He got life.

04:42.041 --> 04:43.333
So why'd they let him out?

04:43.417 --> 04:45.250
After endless appeals,
a DNA test revealed

04:45.333 --> 04:47.250
that the original evidence
was contaminated.

04:47.333 --> 04:49.083
(Lilly)
'The judge overturned
the conviction'

04:49.166 --> 04:50.625
ordered a new trial.

04:50.709 --> 04:52.792
Lack of evidence. We had
no case to move forward.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.875
Hathaway was released
a month ago.

04:54.959 --> 04:55.959
You still think he did it.

04:56.041 --> 04:57.041
Doesn't matter what we think.

04:57.125 --> 04:58.625
Matters what we can prosecute.

04:58.709 --> 05:01.750
What matters to your boss's he's
got a PR disaster on the loose.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.875
Uh, if he did it,
why's he going
around

05:03.959 --> 05:06.250
shoving sex
offenders
off buildings?

05:06.333 --> 05:08.375
(Lilly)
Harold Dixon molested
half a dozen boys

05:08.458 --> 05:09.667
the same age as Clayton.

05:09.750 --> 05:10.834
Yeah, he
could've
just pulled him
off

05:10.917 --> 05:11.917
the Megan's Law website.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.125
Oh, if that's his hit list

05:13.208 --> 05:14.542
right now
he's spraying
buckshot.

05:14.625 --> 05:16.166
And why are we going
after this guy again?

05:16.250 --> 05:17.875
(Scotty)
'He's performing
a public service.'

05:17.959 --> 05:19.125
You're joking, right?

05:19.208 --> 05:20.583
Hey, nobody else
can figure out

05:20.667 --> 05:22.375
what to do with 'em,
certainly not the courts.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.875
They serve their time. We
can't
incarcerate them forever.

05:24.959 --> 05:26.291
Fine, then, phew, cut 'em off.

05:26.375 --> 05:28.208
(Alexandra)
'That'll fix the problem.'

05:28.291 --> 05:30.542
(Scotty)
Sex offender website's just
an admission by the state

05:30.625 --> 05:31.959
that they can't keep
society from harm.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.375
So we just let
some crazed vigilante

05:33.458 --> 05:34.667
use the registry as a hit list?

05:34.750 --> 05:36.250
'Crazed vigilante,
grieving father.'

05:36.333 --> 05:37.583
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.375
(John)
'Talk to the ex-wife.'

05:39.458 --> 05:42.250
See what she remembers about
the day her son disappeared.

05:42.333 --> 05:45.208
- Hm!
- Scotty, line two.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.166
Yeah. Valens.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.625
(man on phone)
'You'll solve
my son's murder, detective?'

05:56.834 --> 05:59.583
Hathaway?

05:59.667 --> 06:02.417
I read about your
brother's case in the paper.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.125
(Scotty)
'So what?'

06:05.208 --> 06:06.333
I'm not a monster.

06:06.417 --> 06:08.375
You killed a man last night.

06:08.458 --> 06:09.917
(Mitch)
'He had it coming.'

06:10.000 --> 06:11.250
You of all people know that.

06:11.333 --> 06:13.083
(Scotty)
'This isn't about me,
Mitch.'

06:13.166 --> 06:15.500
No, it's about what I lost.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.709
And what I need you to do.

06:17.792 --> 06:20.625
You wanna talk to me, come
on in and tell me your story.

06:22.041 --> 06:23.750
(Mitch)
'I didn't kill
my son, detective.'

06:23.834 --> 06:25.834
Now do your job
and find who did.

06:43.709 --> 06:46.959
Has Mitch tried to contact you
since he's been released, Tara?

06:47.041 --> 06:48.792
No.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.667
But he must have
written me over a..

06:51.750 --> 06:54.625
...a thousand
letters from prison.

06:54.709 --> 06:57.083
After the first one, I..

06:58.208 --> 07:00.333
...I threw the rest out.

07:00.417 --> 07:02.792
Why? What'd he say?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.750
That he didn't do it.

07:06.834 --> 07:09.166
You never showed at the trial.

07:09.250 --> 07:12.500
- You believe he did.
- That's what the courts
said.

07:14.542 --> 07:16.875
Look, it was just
too painful, I..

07:16.959 --> 07:20.959
...I just couldn't handle
it.
My world caved in.

07:21.041 --> 07:24.291
You ever seen this
man before, Tara?

07:24.375 --> 07:26.125
Um, no.

07:26.208 --> 07:28.792
- Why?
- He was a pedophile.

07:28.875 --> 07:31.166
Your ex-husband
killed
him this morning.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.583
What?

07:34.291 --> 07:35.834
Mitch killed someone?

07:35.917 --> 07:39.667
He promised to do it again
unless we solve Clay's
murder.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.750
I don't know what to tell you.

07:42.834 --> 07:45.208
If there's anything you
might be able to
remember

07:45.291 --> 07:48.083
about the day
your...son was
murdered.

07:49.834 --> 07:51.417
Before he disappeared.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.333
It's what every
parent fears most.

07:53.417 --> 07:56.709
It's...it's your
worst nightmare.

07:56.792 --> 07:59.208
Only for us..

07:59.291 --> 08:00.792
...it was real.

08:06.875 --> 08:08.834
- Where's Clay?
- What?

08:10.959 --> 08:12.375
Clay, where is he?

08:12.458 --> 08:13.875
He was just here riding
around in the driveway.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.375
Well, you were supposed
to be watching him.

08:15.458 --> 08:17.041
I was. Relax.

08:17.125 --> 08:19.500
He probably just rode
around the block with
Johnny.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.667
Well, he's not supposed
to go past the corner.

08:23.166 --> 08:25.083
Don't worry,
I'll go get
him.

08:29.417 --> 08:31.875
Clay.

08:31.959 --> 08:33.625
Clay!

08:35.083 --> 08:36.125
Clay!

08:42.250 --> 08:44.583
'Clay?'

08:56.291 --> 08:59.166
Hey, have you guys seen Clay?

08:59.250 --> 09:00.417
Not since this morning.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.208
He's not with Johnny?

09:04.041 --> 09:06.417
(female #1)
'Tara, is something wrong?'

09:07.375 --> 09:09.625
Linda, I don't know
where he is.

09:09.709 --> 09:10.875
I didn't see him.

09:10.959 --> 09:12.917
I don't understand.
He couldn't have gone far.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.917
I'll get the car,
go look for him.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.250
I'll get my keys, Mitch.

09:22.166 --> 09:23.375
Clay!

09:25.792 --> 09:27.834
They found him two days later.

09:30.709 --> 09:33.291
And there's not a..

09:33.375 --> 09:36.333
...day that goes by
that I don't blame myself.

09:37.542 --> 09:39.208
(Will)
'You said you saw a postman?'

09:40.709 --> 09:42.083
Uh, right.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.208
That's strange.

09:47.583 --> 09:49.750
Clay disappeared on a Sunday.

09:58.041 --> 09:59.583
Better start explaining
what the hell you were
doing

09:59.667 --> 10:02.250
on that street delivering
mail on a Sunday, Ernie.

10:02.333 --> 10:05.709
Sometimes I'd drop off
parcels on my off-days.

10:05.792 --> 10:07.542
If the address
was on my way home.

10:07.625 --> 10:10.709
Only back then, you didn't have
a record for diddling boys yet.

10:10.792 --> 10:12.750
Run whatever tests you want.

10:12.834 --> 10:15.083
I never touched that kid.

10:15.166 --> 10:18.000
- Wasn't my thing.
- Your thing?

10:18.083 --> 10:21.417
My preference was blonde-haired
boys, ages eight to 12.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.166
Slight built, introverted.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.083
I was always very specific.

10:26.166 --> 10:28.625
Gee, I guess
we're way out of line here.

10:28.709 --> 10:30.125
(Ernie)
'All in the past.'

10:30.208 --> 10:33.250
Years of therapy,
I stay off the Internet.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.750
(Ernest)
'Got mechanisms
to help curb the urges.'

10:35.834 --> 10:36.875
Well, that's comforting.

10:36.959 --> 10:39.417
It doesn't matter
if you believe me.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.875
I paid my debt to society.

10:40.959 --> 10:42.375
(Scotty)
'Far as I'm concerned'

10:42.458 --> 10:44.166
you'll never pay for what
you did to those kids.

10:44.250 --> 10:46.458
Hey, I would never kill a child.

10:47.625 --> 10:49.709
I love children.

10:49.792 --> 10:51.709
(Ernest)
'Guy who killed
that boy was an amateur'

10:51.792 --> 10:53.583
worried about getting caught.

10:53.667 --> 10:54.583
An amateur?

10:54.667 --> 10:56.041
If a boy is properly groomed

10:56.125 --> 10:58.750
you don't worry
about them telling anyone.

10:58.834 --> 11:01.291
They give you...consent.

11:01.375 --> 11:04.875
Consent? A child can't
give an adult consent.

11:04.959 --> 11:08.166
Someday, society
will come around to accept it.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.500
- You sick..
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

11:10.583 --> 11:13.959
If you ask me, you ought to be
going after that little bitch.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.750
- What little bitch?
- Hathaways' babysitter.

11:16.834 --> 11:19.583
(Ernest)
'Wasn't like she was
really watching the kid.'

11:19.667 --> 11:21.166
(Nick)
'What was she doing?'

11:21.250 --> 11:22.709
More like who.

11:22.792 --> 11:26.917
Preppy jock boyfriend always
over there, sneaking around.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.333
When the Hathaways were gone?

11:28.417 --> 11:31.750
Always got to watch out
for the young, clean-cut ones.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.500
(Clayton)
'No, cut it out! Stop it!'

11:42.583 --> 11:44.000
(male #2)
'Shh!'

11:48.917 --> 11:51.000
(male #2)
'You're going to be okay.
Quit being a baby.'

11:55.917 --> 11:57.625
(male #2)
'Shh!'

11:57.709 --> 11:58.959
No, pal, it's not that bad.

12:00.375 --> 12:03.542
You know what?
You like baseball, right?

12:03.625 --> 12:06.041
(male #2)
'Who doesn't like
baseball? Yeah?'

12:06.125 --> 12:09.208
You know, my dad has season
tickets to the Phillies,
right?

12:10.875 --> 12:13.000
[sobbing]
Really?

12:13.083 --> 12:15.542
You think you might
like to go sometime

12:15.625 --> 12:17.375
see the Phillie Phanatic

12:17.458 --> 12:19.125
dancing on the dugout?

12:21.625 --> 12:23.291
[sobbing]
Okay.

12:23.375 --> 12:26.041
Just don't tell
Trish what happened.

12:26.709 --> 12:27.959
Alright?

12:28.041 --> 12:31.500
(male #2)
It'll be our little
secret.

12:31.583 --> 12:33.166
Just us guys.

12:38.417 --> 12:40.667
Total amateur hour.

12:40.750 --> 12:41.917
Never ceases to amaze me

12:42.000 --> 12:44.834
how many parents
put their kids in play.

12:44.917 --> 12:46.166
Just offer them up.

12:46.250 --> 12:47.583
Guess you'd know.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.875
That's why I was surprised
when I heard it was the dad.

12:50.959 --> 12:53.917
(Ernie)
'Unless that's all changed.'

12:54.000 --> 12:56.875
Something I should know?

12:56.959 --> 12:58.333
We'll be in touch.

12:58.417 --> 13:02.000
PO knows where to find me, 24-7.

13:08.333 --> 13:09.458
Call from Hathaway came back

13:09.542 --> 13:11.542
to a pay phone outside
Market East Station.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.041
Check with SEPTA, see if
they can pull a security
tape

13:14.125 --> 13:16.041
confirm it's really Hathaway.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.208
So what are we
doing to find him?

13:19.083 --> 13:20.792
Where Hathaway called from

13:20.875 --> 13:22.917
the building where
he pushed Dixon.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.834
See if we can
narrow his location.

13:24.917 --> 13:26.375
So you have no idea where he is?

13:26.458 --> 13:29.667
Every cop in the 15th District
has an updated photo of him.

13:31.166 --> 13:32.333
What are the red pins?

13:32.417 --> 13:34.375
Registered sex offenders
who lived or worked

13:34.458 --> 13:38.083
in proximity to the Hathaway
residence back in '87.

13:38.166 --> 13:39.917
Depressing, huh?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.500
Names, photos and addresses

13:41.583 --> 13:43.208
all listed on the
Megan's law
website.

13:43.291 --> 13:44.709
That's the law.

13:44.792 --> 13:47.250
We need to shut down
the site till we find
Hathaway.

13:47.333 --> 13:49.542
Public access to that
site supersedes the risk.

13:49.625 --> 13:51.375
Really? Public
got
a right to know

13:51.458 --> 13:53.375
that wasn't a suicide yesterday?

14:08.500 --> 14:10.000
Yeah, sure.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.583
Trish was my girl
back in high school.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.458
When she used to
babysit for the Hathaways.

14:13.542 --> 14:15.709
Heard you used to drop
in on her quite a bit.

14:15.792 --> 14:17.333
Well, no parents.

14:17.417 --> 14:19.125
Best opportunity
to get some play.

14:19.208 --> 14:21.875
Sure. Then you take them out
to the old ballgame, right?

14:21.959 --> 14:24.709
'Cause boys
love baseball, right?

14:24.792 --> 14:27.583
Long as they don't
tell anybody what happened.

14:29.041 --> 14:30.792
- That's sick.
- No argument there.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.417
No, you..

14:32.500 --> 14:34.417
I have three kids,
two boys of my own.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.750
(Lilly)
'We know about the blood
on the underwear, Adam.'

14:36.834 --> 14:38.625
Clay bawling his eyes out.

14:38.709 --> 14:41.041
Uh, no, you've
got
this all wrong.

14:42.542 --> 14:45.875
I was raiding
the liquor cabinet, okay?

14:45.959 --> 14:48.792
I accidentally dropped
a glass on the kitchen floor.

14:48.875 --> 14:51.500
(Adam)
Kid comes in from the
outside in his bare feet

14:51.583 --> 14:52.750
steps on it, cuts his foot.

14:52.834 --> 14:55.291
So how'd blood
get on his underwear, Adam?

14:55.375 --> 14:57.959
I just grabbed something from
the laundry basket, whatever

14:58.041 --> 14:59.125
just to stem the blood flow.

14:59.208 --> 15:00.458
Kid's underwear was on top.

15:00.542 --> 15:03.792
Do you know how dumb
that sounds?

15:03.875 --> 15:05.959
It's the God's honest truth,
I'm telling you.

15:06.041 --> 15:07.500
You gonna have to do
better than that.

15:07.583 --> 15:10.875
Hey, I wasn't even in town
when the kid disappeared.

15:10.959 --> 15:13.542
'I didn't even hear about
it until I got back.'

15:13.625 --> 15:15.792
Just a horror show.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.667
Always haunted me.

15:20.083 --> 15:21.792
Something else
you want to share?

15:21.875 --> 15:25.583
I was over at the house one
night when Trish was sitting.

15:25.667 --> 15:28.834
And I saw something
kind of disturbing.

15:41.583 --> 15:43.291
[moaning]
Wait.

15:43.375 --> 15:44.458
What?

15:44.542 --> 15:46.166
The garage opened.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.333
(Tara)
'Hey, guys, we're home.'

15:51.375 --> 15:52.333
Hide!

15:58.875 --> 16:01.125
Come on, Johnny,
we gotta hide it!

16:01.208 --> 16:02.333
Who gave it to you?

16:02.417 --> 16:03.417
The Scarecrow.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.375
No way!

16:04.458 --> 16:05.542
We can't say anything

16:05.625 --> 16:07.083
or he won't give me
any more cool stuff.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.041
- 'Clay?'
- Your parents are coming!

16:09.125 --> 16:10.792
(Tara)
'Clay!'

16:10.875 --> 16:13.333
Don't tell anybody or
Scarecrow will get mad at me.

16:13.417 --> 16:14.709
Clay, you better hide it.

16:14.792 --> 16:16.542
- Swear not to tell?
- Swear.

16:31.750 --> 16:32.875
The Scarecrow?

16:32.959 --> 16:35.500
Like some kind of secret pal.

16:35.583 --> 16:38.083
But who the hell would give
that knife to a
six-year-old?

16:38.166 --> 16:40.375
You never mentioned
it to Trish?

16:40.458 --> 16:41.667
I was gonna but..

16:41.750 --> 16:44.583
...it took me like,
an hour to get out of
there.

16:44.667 --> 16:46.583
And then I forgot.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.041
<i>now.</i>

16:48.125 --> 16:51.333
Well, it seemed kinda
irrelevant
after they busted the dad.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.834
Goes to show you never can tell.

17:03.959 --> 17:05.750
It was a long time ago.

17:05.834 --> 17:08.083
[smirks]
I was only six years
old.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.709
Clay was my best
friend back then.

17:10.792 --> 17:12.125
(Kat)
It's pretty devastating
what happened.

17:12.208 --> 17:14.458
Scarred the whole neighborhood.

17:14.542 --> 17:17.792
My parents became paranoid about
me playing outside after that.

17:17.875 --> 17:20.709
John, you remember anyone
with the nickname "Scarecrow"?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.583
Yeah. This-this older kid.

17:25.709 --> 17:28.291
Goth freak, lived
next door to us.

17:28.375 --> 17:29.959
(Scotty)
'Got a real name?'

17:30.041 --> 17:33.709
[sighs]
Damon Childress.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.709
(Johnny)
'Something off with that
guy.'

17:35.792 --> 17:37.875
'He was into all kinds of
weird
crap we thought was cool.'

17:37.959 --> 17:39.458
(Kat)
'Like what?'

17:39.542 --> 17:42.375
Ninja stars,
medieval weapons, nunchucks.

17:42.458 --> 17:44.333
- Butterfly knives?
- Right.

17:44.417 --> 17:46.250
You name it.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.542
He slept in his basement.
Parents just left him alone.

17:48.625 --> 17:49.625
Had his own back entrance.

17:49.709 --> 17:50.917
You saw his bedroom?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.500
Even though you guys
were only six.

17:52.583 --> 17:54.709
I guess he didn't have
a lot of friends his own age.

17:54.792 --> 17:55.875
'Was kind of unstable.'

17:55.959 --> 17:57.959
- Emotionally disturbed.
- 'Yeah.'

17:58.041 --> 18:00.125
Just had to be careful
not to rile him up.

18:00.208 --> 18:03.125
Or what? He ever
turn on you? Clay?

18:03.667 --> 18:05.417
Once.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.667
Came after both of us.

18:12.417 --> 18:14.917
(Clayton)
'He-Man, Master
of the Universe!'

18:15.000 --> 18:16.917
By the power of Grayskull!

18:18.125 --> 18:20.583
I have the power.
Watch this one,
Clay.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.959
Watch.

18:23.041 --> 18:25.250
We gotta get back, Johnny.

18:25.333 --> 18:26.875
I'm not supposed
to go past our
street.

18:26.959 --> 18:28.625
One sec. Just watch.

18:28.709 --> 18:30.333
Boo!

18:31.792 --> 18:33.041
Little punk.

18:34.083 --> 18:35.166
Hey, Damon.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.041
- Why you been ducking me?
- What?

18:37.125 --> 18:38.375
(Clayton)
'What do you mean?'

18:38.458 --> 18:39.834
Think you can just
steal from me?

18:39.917 --> 18:42.500
But...you said
I could have that knife.

18:42.583 --> 18:44.959
Nothing's free.
You owe me, boy!

18:55.917 --> 18:57.291
You!

19:08.250 --> 19:10.542
Went back home
and just hid in my room.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.375
Never saw him again.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.583
Never told your parents?

19:16.667 --> 19:19.083
I thought that freak
would kill me.

19:19.166 --> 19:22.542
Those times Damon let you
down into his basement?

19:23.291 --> 19:24.625
He ever try anything?

19:24.709 --> 19:26.709
- Touch you?
- Not me.

19:26.792 --> 19:30.166
Scarecrow was more the type
to get off on torturing
cats.

19:30.250 --> 19:31.917
Think he killed
one that same
day.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.834
You saw him do that?

19:33.917 --> 19:35.041
Kill an animal?

19:35.125 --> 19:37.750
I heard something
later that night.

19:37.834 --> 19:39.083
Looked out.

19:39.166 --> 19:41.709
Saw Damon in his backyard,
burying something.

19:51.834 --> 19:54.083
(John)
'Damon Childress's family
moved out of the neighborhood'

19:54.166 --> 19:56.709
'couple of months after
Clayton Hathaway was killed.'

19:56.792 --> 20:00.000
Current owners gave us
permission to dig up the yard.

20:00.083 --> 20:02.041
Looks like they found something.

20:15.375 --> 20:16.375
(Will)
'Clay's bike.'

20:21.709 --> 20:22.875
Yeah?

20:22.959 --> 20:25.291
(Mitch)
'You find him yet,
detective?'

20:25.375 --> 20:28.542
- Mitch?
- You know who killed my son?

20:28.625 --> 20:32.166
We're close.
We'll find him, I promise
you.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.208
- You believe me.
- 'I believe you, Mitch.'

20:34.291 --> 20:36.834
But you're not helping us,
dropping bodies.

20:36.917 --> 20:39.500
Nobody lifted a damn finger
on my son's murder till now.

20:39.583 --> 20:41.250
This ain't the way
to go about it.

20:41.333 --> 20:44.625
Yeah, you're right. These guys
should be burned at the stake.

20:44.709 --> 20:47.083
You got our attention,
alright?
Nobody else needs to die.

20:47.959 --> 20:49.166
(Mitch)
'No, I..'

20:51.417 --> 20:54.500
I have to do this, for my son.

20:54.583 --> 20:57.000
Your son's gone, Mitch.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.500
Only 'cause I promised him
that I'd be there..

21:02.500 --> 21:04.709
...and I wasn't.

21:06.375 --> 21:09.083
- I understand how you feel.
- No, you don't!

21:10.792 --> 21:13.667
- I lost everything.
- 'I know.'

21:13.750 --> 21:16.125
But...you gotta stop
what you're doing.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.333
(Mitch)
'Too late.'

21:17.417 --> 21:19.792
I already took out
the trash today.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.250
(John)
'Anything on Mitch's call?'

21:44.333 --> 21:45.375
(Scotty)
'Blocked number.'

21:45.458 --> 21:47.667
All we got is
it was a cell phone.

21:47.750 --> 21:50.375
(Nick)
'And the DA's office
on crisis control.'

21:50.458 --> 21:52.208
Ballbuster alert, 6 o'clock.

21:53.083 --> 21:54.417
Any ID yet on the victim?

21:54.500 --> 21:56.166
Still trying to get
prints off him.

21:56.250 --> 21:58.291
Soon as we scrape him
off the hood.

22:02.083 --> 22:03.166
Whoa.

22:03.250 --> 22:05.041
What?

22:05.125 --> 22:06.750
Come see.

22:06.834 --> 22:09.000
Uh, no, thanks, pass.

22:09.083 --> 22:10.333
No, Scotty..

22:10.417 --> 22:12.250
...gotta take a look at this.

22:26.166 --> 22:27.917
It's Grabowski.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.583
The postman?

22:31.667 --> 22:32.792
Special delivery.

22:32.875 --> 22:35.458
How could he know
who we were talking to?

22:36.834 --> 22:39.500
'Cause he's following us.

22:39.583 --> 22:41.625
You interviewed that
man
and didn't notify him

22:41.709 --> 22:43.917
of the possible
threat
to his life?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.959
Think I'll sleep
okay tonight, thanks.

22:46.041 --> 22:47.959
We have a responsibility
to notify anyone

22:48.041 --> 22:49.250
who's a possible target.

22:49.333 --> 22:51.000
Sure, why not offer them
all protective custody?

22:51.083 --> 22:52.333
(John)
'Scotty!'

22:54.166 --> 22:55.667
We'll do our best to notify

22:55.750 --> 22:58.959
every level three sex
offender who fits the
profile.

22:59.041 --> 23:00.917
My boss is
suspending
public access

23:01.000 --> 23:02.875
to the Megan's Law website.

23:05.917 --> 23:08.166
Have a good day, counselor.

23:30.834 --> 23:33.291
Got any "Batman back" issues?

23:33.375 --> 23:37.333
Depends...Detective Comic,
Dark Knight, Shadow of the Bat?

23:37.417 --> 23:39.208
(Lilly)
'Got any where, uh..'

23:39.291 --> 23:42.667
...Batman fights that guy
who looks like Ichabod Crane?

23:42.750 --> 23:44.709
(Lilly)
'Preyed on people's fears?'

23:44.792 --> 23:47.959
- You mean Scarecrow.
- Yeah, that's him.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.834
What do you know
about that guy..

23:51.917 --> 23:53.333
...Damon?

23:56.750 --> 23:59.625
- What is this about?
- Boy named Clayton Hathaway.

24:01.500 --> 24:02.917
- Long time ago.
- Yeah.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.375
But I'm sure you remember him.

24:04.458 --> 24:07.375
Or at least, burying
his bike in your
backyard.

24:09.583 --> 24:10.875
Alright.

24:10.959 --> 24:12.875
I took the kid's bike.

24:12.959 --> 24:15.125
It was stupid,
I was gonna sell it.

24:15.208 --> 24:16.834
- But that's it.
- You assaulted a
six-year-old.

24:16.917 --> 24:18.500
Stole his bike
and threatened his
life.

24:18.583 --> 24:21.375
I had a lot more anger
than friends back then.

24:21.458 --> 24:23.667
- But I didn't kill him.
- Then why'd you bury the
bike?

24:23.750 --> 24:26.041
As soon as the kid
went missing, I panicked.

24:26.125 --> 24:27.542
You need to come down,
make a statement--

24:27.625 --> 24:31.083
Wait! I don't get the hassle,
didn't the dad do it?

24:31.166 --> 24:33.375
- Even the mom said so.
- No, she didn't.

24:33.458 --> 24:35.166
I heard her myself.

24:35.250 --> 24:37.333
She knew way before anyone else.

24:48.917 --> 24:50.291
(Cliff)
Don't worry
about the caterer, Mitch.

24:50.375 --> 24:52.959
- I took care of it.
- Right.

24:53.041 --> 24:54.709
'Thanks, Cliff.'

24:54.792 --> 24:57.250
Anything you need, just ask.

25:04.041 --> 25:06.750
(Tara)
'I found something out,
Linda.'

25:06.834 --> 25:09.709
(Linda)
'What is it?'

25:09.792 --> 25:11.792
I just..

25:12.917 --> 25:15.417
...I don't know him anymore.

25:15.500 --> 25:16.917
What do you mean, Tara?

25:17.000 --> 25:21.166
I should've seen it, I
should
have stopped it somehow.

25:21.250 --> 25:22.250
(Linda)
'What?'

25:22.333 --> 25:24.417
He's not the man
I thought he was.

25:24.500 --> 25:29.375
- What're you saying, Tara?
- I saw something, Linda.

25:32.917 --> 25:36.333
What would you do if you found
out your husband was a monster?

25:42.208 --> 25:44.375
(Lilly)
'So, Tara saw something that
turned her against Mitch?'

25:44.458 --> 25:45.542
Yup.

25:45.625 --> 25:47.166
Before the cops
or anyone else knew.

25:47.250 --> 25:48.709
But she never said anything.

25:48.792 --> 25:50.250
Never testified
against her husband.

25:50.333 --> 25:52.041
Didn't go to his trial, either.

25:52.125 --> 25:54.333
That's when everybody said
they knew he did it.

25:54.417 --> 25:57.500
Wife loses faith in
the husband, so does the
jury.

26:00.083 --> 26:01.709
Am I under arrest?

26:01.792 --> 26:03.125
No.

26:03.208 --> 26:05.125
He's here to protect you.

26:15.417 --> 26:17.208
(Kat)
'You already knew, Tara.'

26:17.291 --> 26:19.375
'Before the police
suspected it was Mitch.'

26:19.458 --> 26:21.208
(Will)
You turned on him because
you found out something

26:21.291 --> 26:22.375
before the wake.

26:22.458 --> 26:25.000
That your husband
was a monster.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.792
Does it matter what I believed?

26:26.875 --> 26:28.542
Yes, it does.

26:31.750 --> 26:34.583
I failed, you know..

26:34.667 --> 26:36.917
...I failed to
protect my own child.

26:38.041 --> 26:40.250
What made you
think it was
Mitch?

26:40.333 --> 26:42.000
You think you know someone.

26:43.291 --> 26:45.667
Everything you
believe to be true.

26:49.542 --> 26:51.667
You have no idea.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.709
(Will)
'What did you see, Tara?'

26:56.083 --> 26:58.125
I was such a fool.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.250
The caterer's here.

27:13.333 --> 27:15.041
(Tara)
'People will be coming soon.'

27:15.125 --> 27:17.417
You shouldn't have
babied him so much.

27:17.500 --> 27:18.917
What?

27:19.000 --> 27:23.166
Made him vulnerable, the
kind
of kid these guys prey on.

27:26.583 --> 27:29.041
You think this was my fault?

27:29.125 --> 27:32.083
'You're the one
that always pushed him.'

27:32.166 --> 27:34.417
"Let him go,
he's fine, he's a boy"

27:34.500 --> 27:37.542
- I was right.
- You were wrong!

27:37.625 --> 27:41.208
You let him go,
only he's not fine, Mitch.

27:41.291 --> 27:42.709
He's dead.

27:46.417 --> 27:47.959
I need some aspirin.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.041
'Honey.'

28:35.875 --> 28:38.041
I'm sorry.

28:40.291 --> 28:42.041
I just miss him so much.

28:45.417 --> 28:46.917
Do you really?

28:48.125 --> 28:49.166
What?

28:49.250 --> 28:52.125
Do you really
miss him?

28:52.208 --> 28:53.750
I mean it.

28:57.542 --> 28:59.792
Why are you looking
at me like that?

29:13.417 --> 29:16.333
He had photos
of Johnny Burrell?

29:16.417 --> 29:18.458
Thumb in his mouth..

29:18.542 --> 29:19.667
...same way Clay was found.

29:19.750 --> 29:21.500
You never came forward
with those photos?

29:21.583 --> 29:22.917
They had enough to convict him.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.083
I was trying
to protect my friend.

29:25.166 --> 29:28.417
I never wanted Linda to see
those, so I destroyed them.

29:29.750 --> 29:31.500
You never told her.

29:34.750 --> 29:36.125
I told her..

29:37.959 --> 29:40.625
...to never let her son
go near Mitch again.

30:04.041 --> 30:06.542
- Hathaway?
- You leave my wife alone.

30:06.625 --> 30:09.792
(Scotty)
'You twisted, lying sack
of crap. Wasting our time.'

30:09.875 --> 30:11.041
What?

30:11.125 --> 30:13.041
You're no better
than the garbage you kill.

30:13.125 --> 30:14.208
What're you talking about?

30:14.291 --> 30:15.792
(Scotty)
'I know what you did.'

30:15.875 --> 30:18.542
Those photos you took of Johnny
Burrell, sucking his thumb.

30:18.625 --> 30:21.041
(Mitch)
'What? Photos?'

30:21.125 --> 30:23.041
Your wife found them
in the bathroom, Mitch.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.542
Remember?

30:26.792 --> 30:28.250
No, no.

30:28.333 --> 30:31.125
You wonder why she turned
on you, you psychopath..

30:49.875 --> 30:53.125
(Scotty)
'There's a lot of things
not adding up, Johnny.'

30:53.208 --> 30:55.709
'Little things
you never told us.'

30:55.792 --> 30:57.250
Anyone.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.083
(Lilly)
We can understand why.

30:59.166 --> 31:01.709
- How painful it is to
admit.
- Admit what?

31:01.792 --> 31:03.333
What Mitch Hathaway did to you.

31:03.417 --> 31:05.041
I don't know what you mean.
He didn't do anything to me.

31:05.125 --> 31:06.750
If you don't deal
with this now..

31:06.834 --> 31:09.125
...eventually,
it'll just eat you alive.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.834
No. You got the wrong guy.

31:11.917 --> 31:15.583
You think you're strong,
it's all in the past.

31:15.667 --> 31:17.792
Then one day you wake up

31:17.875 --> 31:18.834
you just can't get out of bed.

31:18.917 --> 31:20.291
(Lilly)
'Or worse.'

31:20.375 --> 31:22.333
'You do the same thing
to somebody else.'

31:22.417 --> 31:24.625
- Even your own kid.
- No. That's not me.

31:24.709 --> 31:27.208
Johnny, we need your help here.

31:27.291 --> 31:29.834
We know what Hathaway liked.

31:29.917 --> 31:31.375
(Scotty)
'What he did to you.'

31:31.458 --> 31:34.166
- The photos he took of you.
- What-what photos?

31:34.250 --> 31:37.917
The ones of you in bed,
sleeping
with your thumb in your mouth.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.458
Posed just like his son
Clay after he killed him.

31:43.000 --> 31:43.959
It's okay,
you can tell--

31:44.041 --> 31:45.750
No, it's not okay!

31:45.834 --> 31:47.125
Alright, it never was.

31:47.208 --> 31:48.500
And I don't care what you think.

31:48.583 --> 31:51.250
It wasn't Mr.
Hathaway
who took the photos.

32:47.083 --> 32:48.959
Go to sleep, son.

32:54.375 --> 32:56.250
Night, daddy.

33:05.125 --> 33:07.709
It was your father
who took those pictures?

33:09.166 --> 33:11.542
I swear my father
never
touched me that way.

33:13.041 --> 33:15.166
Maybe because
you were his own son.

33:17.667 --> 33:19.250
You were off-limits.

33:21.542 --> 33:23.792
But Clay wasn't so lucky.

33:34.041 --> 33:35.458
Yeah? Rush.

33:36.834 --> 33:38.041
(Lilly)
'What?'

33:38.125 --> 33:40.083
I need a marked car
to go to 8th and Walnut.

33:40.166 --> 33:41.667
Okay, Cliff Burrell. Just send
the car over and meet me there.

33:41.750 --> 33:43.291
(Lilly)
'Right now? Where?'

33:43.375 --> 33:45.083
Oh, what do you mean? Why not?

33:45.166 --> 33:46.166
(Lilly)
'Hang up.'

33:46.250 --> 33:48.583
- What?
- Hang up.

33:48.667 --> 33:50.083
Hathaway just
took
Cliff Burrell

33:50.166 --> 33:51.917
up to the roof
of the building where he
works.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.125
- What?
- Boss said SWAT is en route.

33:53.208 --> 33:54.667
That ain't possible.

33:54.750 --> 33:57.250
How the hell could Hathaway
have known it was Burrell?

34:00.333 --> 34:01.750
Scotty?

34:01.834 --> 34:03.917
I told him about
the pictures Tara found.

34:04.750 --> 34:06.792
I thought it was him.

34:06.875 --> 34:08.208
We gotta go.

34:35.208 --> 34:36.542
Go to the edge.
Go to the edge.

34:36.625 --> 34:38.917
- Please, please.
- Move!

34:42.875 --> 34:43.792
Move!

34:45.500 --> 34:47.834
Shut up!

34:49.875 --> 34:50.750
Shut up!

34:54.041 --> 34:56.166
(Mitch)
Shut up!

35:06.542 --> 35:08.166
Mitch!

35:11.250 --> 35:13.625
Mitch, it's me.

35:14.917 --> 35:16.166
It's me, Detective Valens.

35:16.250 --> 35:18.375
That's fine right there,
detective.

35:18.458 --> 35:20.375
I know it wasn't you, Mitch.

35:20.458 --> 35:21.709
I'm on your side here.

35:23.250 --> 35:26.500
I gave up believing anybody
was on my side a long time ago.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.792
Understood,
but listen to me now.

35:30.375 --> 35:32.375
You don't put down that gun
and step back..

35:32.458 --> 35:35.083
...these guys are gonna put
a bullet in your brain.

35:35.166 --> 35:37.750
I don't plan
on walking off this roof
alive.

35:37.834 --> 35:39.125
But I'm taking this
piece of garbage with me.

35:39.208 --> 35:40.792
Please, please!

35:40.875 --> 35:42.208
(Scotty)
Yeah, I know you want
to kill him, Mitch.

35:42.291 --> 35:43.458
I understand, I do.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.709
But you don't wanna
die this way.

35:48.083 --> 35:49.667
He killed my son.

35:51.125 --> 35:54.625
He planted those photos,
he turned my wife against me.

35:55.583 --> 35:56.875
Mitch.

35:56.959 --> 35:58.083
Tell him what you did.

35:59.458 --> 36:00.875
I wanna know before you
die.
Tell him what you did.

36:00.959 --> 36:03.000
Tell him!
Tell him damn
it!

36:03.083 --> 36:04.792
Mitch, this won't
bring your son
back.

36:04.875 --> 36:07.625
Oh, you're gonna
die,
you're gonna die.

36:07.709 --> 36:10.709
- You're gonna die!
- Stop! Mitch! No!

36:10.792 --> 36:14.417
- Stop! Stop!
- Easy, Mitch!

36:14.500 --> 36:16.208
Tara.

36:19.417 --> 36:21.375
He did this.

36:21.458 --> 36:22.875
'To Clay..'

36:24.250 --> 36:25.583
To us.

36:26.709 --> 36:28.500
[crying]
I'm sorry, Mitch.

36:30.291 --> 36:33.208
I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you.

36:34.333 --> 36:36.166
(Tara)
'I let you down.'

36:38.250 --> 36:39.959
But I lost him.

36:42.041 --> 36:43.667
I looked away.

36:45.583 --> 36:47.750
[crying]
I never should have looked
away.

36:47.834 --> 36:50.709
(Tara)
No, this is not
your fault, Mitch.

36:53.750 --> 36:55.709
(Tara)
'Don't do this, Mitch.'

36:57.208 --> 37:01.583
[crying]
Oh, please, don't do
this.

37:02.792 --> 37:04.166
I need you.

37:08.083 --> 37:10.917
[crying]
Do you know
I never stopped loving you?

37:11.458 --> 37:13.750
Me, too.

37:13.834 --> 37:16.166
[Tara crying]
'Me, too.'

37:17.542 --> 37:21.458
Cliff, just...tell the truth.

37:21.542 --> 37:23.125
We know how you watched
his son while he slept

37:23.208 --> 37:25.792
'took pictures of him.'

37:25.875 --> 37:28.667
I...I'm so sorry.

37:28.750 --> 37:31.875
But you couldn't touch
Johnny, 'cause he was yours.

37:31.959 --> 37:34.041
I swore I never would.

37:34.125 --> 37:36.375
[smirks]
So you took mine.

37:39.083 --> 37:41.375
my boy

37:43.750 --> 37:47.875
[sobbing]
I fought it for...for so
long.

37:47.959 --> 37:49.500
The feelings.

37:49.583 --> 37:52.333
And then, I-I-I
couldn't anymore.

37:52.417 --> 37:54.583
[crying]
I'm so sorry.

38:07.125 --> 38:09.917
Hey, little buddy,
what happened?

38:10.000 --> 38:11.291
'Damon took my bike.'

38:11.375 --> 38:14.959
He pushed me off,
and I scraped up my
knee.

38:17.125 --> 38:18.750
Tore it up
pretty good, huh?

38:18.834 --> 38:21.083
It hurts bad.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.500
Well, let me see.

38:28.417 --> 38:29.750
Yeah.

38:31.500 --> 38:34.125
Need to clean that up,
get you a bandage.

38:36.083 --> 38:37.333
I'll just walk home.

38:38.875 --> 38:39.875
It's okay.

38:39.959 --> 38:41.917
I got a first aid kit
in my tool chest.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.959
Something to take the sting out.

38:44.041 --> 38:45.917
I don't know.

38:47.083 --> 38:48.667
Won't hurt a bit, promise.

38:49.792 --> 38:52.417
My dad always tells
me just walk it off.

38:53.959 --> 38:55.250
Come on.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.917
You're bleeding.

38:58.166 --> 38:59.583
You want a soda or something?

38:59.667 --> 39:02.458
Got a fridge full
back in the garage.

39:02.542 --> 39:04.208
What kind?

39:05.500 --> 39:06.875
You like grape?

39:10.000 --> 39:11.417
Yeah, sure.

39:12.875 --> 39:14.792
Go on. Help yourself.
