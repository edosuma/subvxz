00:09.077 --> 00:10.311
Hey, Dolores.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.812
Hey, Danny,
how are you?

00:11.945 --> 00:14.348
I'm great.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.751
Hit the jackpot with
that Ruby Red lotto you sold me.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.087
Woo-hoo.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.621
What'd you win?

00:20.754 --> 00:22.123
Five whole dollars.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.424
You're rich.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.025
It's gonna chance my life.

00:27.095 --> 00:28.362
Stay there

00:28.496 --> 00:29.530
and don't move.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.699
You, empty the register.

00:31.832 --> 00:32.866
Now!

00:33.000 --> 00:34.268
Come on.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.204
Come on, bitch.
Let's go! Let's go!

00:36.337 --> 00:37.605
Do what he says.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.144
Come on, where's the rest of it?

00:43.277 --> 00:44.312
Where's the rest of it?
That's...

00:44.445 --> 00:45.813
all I have.
No, you've got more.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.014
You've got more.
No.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.116
Man, she's telling the tr...

00:48.216 --> 00:49.850
You shut up.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.352
I don't.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.687
Don't hold out on me, bitch.
I'm not. I swear.

01:14.475 --> 01:15.509
Call 911.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.749
911. What's your emergency?

01:21.882 --> 01:23.417
Damn it.
I want to report
a robbery in my bodega.

01:25.653 --> 01:29.923
I believe the impossible
is possible. Why?

01:30.057 --> 01:33.527
Because I'm proof positive
that it's not where you start,

01:33.661 --> 01:35.229
it's where you finish.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.398
When I was a little girl,
my best friend said to me

01:37.531 --> 01:38.866
that we were the only ones

01:38.999 --> 01:40.868
who could change our future.

01:41.001 --> 01:42.770
It's true. I did.
I know you did.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.672
She was right,
and I now run one of

01:44.772 --> 01:47.375
the most successful
tech companies in the world.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.943
And I'm here to tell
all the girls out there,

01:50.077 --> 01:52.613
the future is yours.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.615
Get off social media.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.617
Get into your heads and hearts.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.519
I'm partial to coding,
but find

01:58.619 --> 02:00.020
what sparks you.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.955
Like sexually harassing
your employees?

02:07.595 --> 02:09.463
You want to tell the world
what you did to me?

02:09.597 --> 02:11.465
I didn't do anything.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.267
Call security. Now.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.736
I was an employee
at Moore House Technologies

02:15.869 --> 02:19.240
when Kyla Moore forced me
into a sexual relationship.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.108
When I finally stood up to her

02:21.242 --> 02:23.377
and said no,
she had me fired.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.479
That's not true.
I've hired a lawyer.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.047
Get him out.
And I'm suing you

02:27.147 --> 02:28.081
and everyone will know...
Come on, let's go.

02:28.216 --> 02:29.217
...what a predator you are.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.117
Get him the hell
out of here now!

02:37.958 --> 02:39.427
Thanks for coming.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.161
Of course. Is Bull here yet?

02:41.295 --> 02:42.830
He's... indisposed.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.632
Indisposed?

02:44.765 --> 02:46.667
This is Kyla
and her husband Oscar.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.970
Please meet TAC's chief legal
counsel, Chester Palmer.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.906
Thank you so much
for coming.
Of course.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.908
Please have a seat.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.310
So,

02:56.444 --> 02:58.446
I understand that someone
has accused you

02:58.579 --> 02:59.447
of sexual harassment.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.815
Yes, and it's trending.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.851
D-Don't go down
that rabbit hole.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.152
You're right. You're right.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.788
This man...
Raiden Parks.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.657
Is there any truth
to his allegations?

03:09.790 --> 03:13.261
I slept with Raiden,
but it was consensual.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.296
I had no idea
he was my employee.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.164
We have more than
3,000 employees

03:17.298 --> 03:19.032
in New York,
not counting freelancers.

03:19.166 --> 03:22.002
It would be impossible for Kyla
to know everyone.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.707
Okay, I'm sorry,
but you don't seem upset

03:26.840 --> 03:28.208
about your wife's affair,
Mr. Moore.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.478
Oh, uh, that's
because it wasn't an affair.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.479
We have an open marriage.

03:31.612 --> 03:32.946
You do?

03:33.046 --> 03:37.451
I know it's unconventional,
but it works for us.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.852
There's rules.

03:38.986 --> 03:39.953
It can't last longer
than three months.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.689
No one the other person knows.

03:41.822 --> 03:42.723
If you start
developing feelings,

03:42.856 --> 03:44.057
we cut it off immediately.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.193
The point is,
is that we are still

03:46.327 --> 03:48.028
completely committed
to each other.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.463
So,

03:49.563 --> 03:51.064
if you didn't know Mr. Parks
from work,

03:51.198 --> 03:52.165
how did you meet him?

03:52.300 --> 03:53.801
I keep a suite at the Arlo.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.669
Uh, we met at the bar next door.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.137
He was reading Auden.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.373
She's a sucker for Auden.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.909
After a few drinks,
I invited him upstairs.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.744
We met there
for a couple months

04:03.877 --> 04:06.013
until I discovered
he worked for me.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.548
How'd you find that out?

04:07.681 --> 04:09.650
I stopped by our satellite
office in Long Island City

04:09.750 --> 04:12.553
and bumped into him in the hall.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.887
I ended things immediately.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.523
But you didn't fire him?

04:15.656 --> 04:18.592
No. He was a freelance coder
on a six-month contract.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.060
He finished out his term,

04:20.193 --> 04:21.429
just like every other coder
on his team.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.331
Just because you didn't know him

04:23.431 --> 04:25.032
doesn't mean he didn't know you.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.834
You own
the company he works for.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.101
You've been
all over cable news,

04:28.235 --> 04:29.337
on the cover of
every magazine.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.071
Wait...

04:31.204 --> 04:33.106
Didn't you mention Auden
in that New Yorker profile?

04:33.240 --> 04:34.875
That sounds right.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.410
Okay, what are the odds
that Raiden

04:36.544 --> 04:37.911
just happened
to be at the bar

04:38.045 --> 04:39.547
next door to the hotel
where Kyla keeps a suite

04:39.680 --> 04:40.781
and just happened

04:40.914 --> 04:42.015
to be reading Auden?

04:42.115 --> 04:43.451
He set her up.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.419
Maybe there was a gunman
on the grassy knoll.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.054
Maybe there wasn't.

04:47.187 --> 04:50.858
I did not force that man
to have sex with me, Mr. Palmer.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.362
Will you help me?
Will you take my case?

04:57.965 --> 05:01.201
So, he worked for her,
they slept together,

05:01.301 --> 05:02.903
and now he's out of a job?

05:03.036 --> 05:04.472
Kyla did not know
that he worked for her,

05:04.605 --> 05:06.073
and the sex was consensual.

05:06.206 --> 05:08.275
Mm. Well,
it's tough to prove a negative.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.478
Tougher to prove consent.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.212
Do you want to do this later?

05:12.312 --> 05:14.748
No, I'm fine.
I just tweaked my back.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.250
That tweak looks more
like a torque.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.653
No. I...
I offered to help

05:19.787 --> 05:21.288
this delivery man
with some boxes.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.991
He neglected to tell me
they were filled with bricks.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.793
I'm okay.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.961
All right.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.263
You might want to
settle this one quietly.

05:30.398 --> 05:31.832
It's already in the press.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.634
Settling will look like
an admission of guilt.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.168
Kyla's career will be ruined.

05:35.302 --> 05:38.338
Well, it's gonna be even worse
if she loses in court.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.774
Open marriage doesn't sit well
with the jury.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.109
Yeah, you're right.

05:42.242 --> 05:43.844
It threatens
the idea of marriage.

05:43.977 --> 05:47.014
People don't want to think
that monogamy is impossible.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.617
And besides, most of the people
in our jury pool are married,

05:49.750 --> 05:51.151
or they want to be married
someday.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.086
Okay, you know
what else threatens marriage?

05:53.186 --> 05:54.822
Adultery.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.525
How many male politicians and
CEOs have cheated on their wives

05:57.658 --> 06:00.193
and gotten to move on
like nothing happened?

06:00.327 --> 06:02.696
But a woman has a relationship
outside her marriage,

06:02.830 --> 06:04.031
that her husband

06:04.164 --> 06:06.133
is okay with,
and she has to wear

06:06.266 --> 06:07.134
a scarlet letter
for the rest of her life.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.436
It's a double standard.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.504
Oh, I know. I...
You both have daughters.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.939
Don't you want them

06:12.039 --> 06:13.841
to be judged by
the same standard as men?

06:13.974 --> 06:15.809
Of course.
Absolutely.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.111
Then Kyla can't give up
without a fight.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.379
Okay, but are you sure

06:19.513 --> 06:20.981
we should be
the ones doing the fighting?

06:21.114 --> 06:22.550
Maybe we can refer her
to another firm.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.685
Why? Because this case has
a stink on it?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.019
No.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.888
But this case
is gonna get dirty,

06:28.021 --> 06:30.157
and she is your friend.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.693
And she might not like
where this ends up.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.862
You might not like
what you find out about her.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.664
Kyla is telling the truth.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.199
She didn't tell you about
her open marriage.

06:41.034 --> 06:44.204
People lie,
even to their friends.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.306
I mean...

06:46.406 --> 06:47.741
I didn't really
throw my back out

06:47.875 --> 06:49.409
helping a delivery guy.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.412
I was trying to ties my shoes.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.514
That's embarrassing.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.348
My point exactly.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.150
You don't know what's
gonna come of this, Marissa,

06:57.250 --> 06:58.986
and that's all I'm saying.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.189
If a friendship is strong
enough, it can weather anything.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.357
Then that is that.

07:04.492 --> 07:07.360
All right,
if you guys wouldn't mind,

07:07.495 --> 07:10.097
I'd like to try to sit down
without any witnesses.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.770
I've, uh, got the number
to a great chiropractor...

07:16.904 --> 07:18.706
I'm fine. Thank you, Chunk.
Love you.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.948
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.051
Okay.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.553
Ow! That was a mistake.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.801
Raiden Parks is desperate
for money.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.069
Good morning to you, too.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.971
I told you this was entrapment.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.540
Well, why is he so hard up?

07:52.640 --> 07:53.574
Messy divorce,

07:53.707 --> 07:54.975
big child support payments.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.476
He's been in arrears
for almost a year.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.745
Arrears.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.780
You're in your ear.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.782
"Arrears."
Arrears is a weird word.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.484
Yeah, uh, he took
some muscle relaxers.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.086
They're having an effect.

08:09.456 --> 08:10.758
I'm fine.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.660
Yeah, as long as you don't
try to stand up.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.294
Standing's overrated.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.830
Oh. Oh.
Got it. Got it.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.302
Continue.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.838
Raiden's attorney
just requested Kyla's emails

08:24.972 --> 08:26.774
going back five years.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.176
I figured that. I already had
the paralegals go through them.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.944
There's nothing explosive.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.279
Are you sure? That's a lot of
emails to comb through.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.447
That is why God invented
keyword searches.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.016
Sorry, I'm late.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.284
Oh, no!

08:37.417 --> 08:38.819
What happened to your arm?

08:38.952 --> 08:41.421
Oh, I, uh, tweaked my shoulder
in Krav Maga.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.790
Krav Maga.

08:42.923 --> 08:43.791
Hmm.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.626
Did you hurt your arm

08:45.759 --> 08:47.661
trying to tie your shoelaces,
too?

08:47.795 --> 08:49.429
Uh, sure,
if it makes you feel better.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.998
Mm-hmm.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.702
Okay, so I put in a call
to Penelope Urgola.

08:54.835 --> 08:55.936
She works at Moore House Tech.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.470
She's Raiden's outcry witness--

08:57.605 --> 08:59.106
someone that he talked to
about the harassment.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.507
And what did she have to say?

09:00.641 --> 09:01.675
Well,
she claimed Raiden asked her

09:01.809 --> 09:03.043
how to reject Kyla's advances

09:03.176 --> 09:04.645
without getting fired.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.046
Did she ever witness
the harassment personally?

09:06.179 --> 09:07.815
No.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.282
But she did say Kyla never
came to the satellite office

09:09.382 --> 09:10.951
until after Raiden
started working there,

09:11.051 --> 09:12.185
and then she was there a lot.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.987
Kyla told me

09:14.121 --> 09:15.623
that they were doing renovations
on the main conference room.

09:15.723 --> 09:16.957
That's why she started going
to the satellite office.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.659
Unfortunately,

09:18.792 --> 09:21.895
Penelope Urgola isn't
Raiden's only outcry witness.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.831
He's planning to put
his therapist on the stand.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.298
And what's
the therapist gonna say?

09:25.398 --> 09:26.533
Raiden started seeing her

09:26.667 --> 09:29.036
shortly after Kyla
allegedly forced him

09:29.169 --> 09:30.503
to sleep with her.

09:30.638 --> 09:31.471
He's been in severe
emotional distress.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.642
Is on antidepressants,
anxiety meds.

09:34.742 --> 09:37.544
I am telling you, this is
a carefully orchestrated setup.

09:37.678 --> 09:38.912
Danny, why don't you...

09:39.046 --> 09:41.048
Oh, sorry.
You probably don't feel up

09:41.181 --> 09:42.349
to a field trip.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.051
What? No, it's... It's fine.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.653
I'm-I'm good. Seriously.

09:45.753 --> 09:46.987
Okay.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.355
Then can you head over
to the bar

09:48.488 --> 09:49.757
where Kyla and Raiden first met?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.925
Just see if anyone saw him
target her

09:52.059 --> 09:53.560
or manipulate her in any way.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.429
Sure. I'll-I'll be there
when they open for lunch.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.265
I think you need to have
another talk with your friend.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.000
All right,
and see if there's anything

10:00.100 --> 10:01.368
that she hasn't told us,
'cause what I'm hearing so far,

10:01.501 --> 10:02.602
it don't sound good.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.738
It don't sound good.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.740
What are we talking about?

10:08.842 --> 10:11.278
Might be time for someone
to go lie down.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.846
Oh, yeah, she's right.
You should go home.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.581
That looks very painful.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.118
I think she's talking about you.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.520
I'm in arrears.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.297
Hi, I'm doing an investigation,

10:30.430 --> 10:31.932
and I need to talk
to your staff.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.266
Nobody's in trouble.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.735
There won't be any problems.
Cool?

10:36.036 --> 10:38.371
Don't hassle the customers,
and you can knock yourself out.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.406
Great.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.574
How about we start with you?

10:41.709 --> 10:43.410
Have you seen either of
these people here?

10:43.543 --> 10:45.612
The names are Raiden Parks,
Kyla Moore.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.614
I mean, maybe?

10:47.748 --> 10:49.049
We get a lot of people.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.818
Great.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.055
Did you ever see him here alone,

10:55.155 --> 10:57.490
before they started meeting up?

10:57.624 --> 11:00.260
Probably arrived separately
but left together?

11:03.964 --> 11:05.733
Yeah. Yeah, I saw them.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.334
They came in a couple
of times at least.

11:07.467 --> 11:08.736
What'd they do?

11:08.836 --> 11:10.670
Ate. Drank. Left.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.306
Did you get a sense of
a dynamic between them?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.843
Did he seem like he was
in any way preying on her?

11:15.976 --> 11:18.011
No. I mean,
not that I noticed.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.512
Great.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.514
Oh, man.

11:21.648 --> 11:22.682
What's going on there?

11:22.816 --> 11:24.117
Tore it playing racquetball.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.585
You got any good tequila?

11:26.653 --> 11:28.355
Lots.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.258
All right then.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.692
You, um,

11:32.826 --> 11:34.627
want some anti-inflammatory
to go with that?

11:34.762 --> 11:36.196
I got some back here.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.198
Alcohol's not really a big help
when you're, uh,

11:38.331 --> 11:39.833
healing muscle.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.136
Works for me.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.304
Feel better already.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.708
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

11:48.842 --> 11:50.510
I am so glad you're here.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.612
I've climbing the walls.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.882
Turns out I'm not very good

11:55.015 --> 11:57.150
at putting my fate
in other people's hands.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.451
No, that was never you.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.121
Be honest with me.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.522
Are we gonna lose?

12:02.655 --> 12:04.892
We're still
assessing the case,

12:05.025 --> 12:07.294
but there are some concerns
amongst my team.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.896
They think
the jurors won't like me

12:09.029 --> 12:10.330
because I have an open marriage.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.899
They're worried
the jurors might not

12:12.032 --> 12:13.133
understand that choice.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.968
And to be honest, I'm...

12:15.068 --> 12:17.905
not sure I fully understand it,
either.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.572
You and Oscar
always seemed so...

12:19.706 --> 12:21.241
Happy?

12:21.374 --> 12:22.976
Yeah.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.912
I know.
A couple years ago,

12:25.045 --> 12:27.214
Oscar stopped wanting
to have sex with me.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.082
At first I felt rejected,

12:29.216 --> 12:31.218
but then I worked the problem.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.854
Oscar and I have been married
for 20 years.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.990
We run a business together.
We do everything together.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.658
So I realized,

12:38.758 --> 12:41.895
maybe Oscar needed some variety.

12:42.029 --> 12:45.765
If it could save my marriage,
I was willing to try it.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.268
And it worked.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.171
Here we are, still together.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.206
Still happy.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.741
Until this nightmare.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.944
We are going to
get through this.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.446
But I need to know.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.448
Is there anything else
you can think of

13:01.581 --> 13:03.116
that Raiden might be able
to spring on us?

13:03.250 --> 13:05.886
Any pictures, videos?

13:06.019 --> 13:07.187
Voice mails?

13:07.287 --> 13:08.788
I should've told you this
already,

13:08.922 --> 13:11.558
but I was embarrassed.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.227
I sent Raiden a few racy videos.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.562
How bad are they?

13:15.695 --> 13:18.966
Raiden said
he liked to be dominated.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.700
So they're

13:20.800 --> 13:22.735
basically me telling him that
he had to do whatever I asked

13:22.870 --> 13:24.404
or I'd punish him.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.373
Do you have anything from him
where he says that,

13:26.473 --> 13:28.041
that he likes to be dominated?

13:28.976 --> 13:30.043
No.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.044
I know you don't
want to settle...

13:31.144 --> 13:32.279
Marissa.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.280
You realize the implications...

13:33.413 --> 13:34.647
I don't want to settle.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.649
I don't want that creep
to see one dime.

13:36.783 --> 13:39.152
But I'm afraid
if we go to court,

13:39.286 --> 13:40.921
you're gonna get slaughtered.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.226
In exchange for dropping
the civil suit

13:46.326 --> 13:47.794
against our client

13:47.928 --> 13:50.263
and signing an NDA,

13:50.397 --> 13:52.966
Ms. Moore is prepared
to offer your client

13:53.100 --> 13:55.903
a one-time settlement fee
of $7 million.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.570
That's extortion.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.139
Your wife needs to pay
for what she did to me.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.807
Do we have an agreement?

14:00.941 --> 14:02.109
Not quite.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.777
My client has
one more stipulation.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.279
Kyla Moore has to resign

14:06.413 --> 14:08.982
as CEO of Moore House Tech.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.183
You can't be serious.

14:10.317 --> 14:11.451
Sexual predators shouldn't be

14:11.584 --> 14:13.186
in positions of power.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.655
You step down or no deal.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.661
We walked away, obviously.

14:21.794 --> 14:24.364
Kyla spent her life
building that company.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.466
She's not giving it up
for a shakedown artist.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.635
I tried to get Raiden's attorney
to back off,

14:28.768 --> 14:30.370
but she wouldn't budge.
Huh.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.705
"Huh"?

14:32.839 --> 14:34.942
That's all you've got? Huh?

14:35.042 --> 14:36.843
Maybe he's still out of it
from the muscle.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.445
I'm not out of it.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.047
Let me get up. I'll...

14:40.180 --> 14:41.514
No, I'm gonna stay down.
Yeah.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.383
You offer a shakedown artist
$7 million,

14:43.516 --> 14:45.185
and he doesn't take it?

14:45.318 --> 14:47.154
That doesn't add up.
He said he didn't want Kyla

14:47.287 --> 14:50.023
to be in a position to harass
any more employees.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.225
Do you believe him?
No.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.161
He's got an ulterior motive.
I just...

14:54.294 --> 14:56.029
don't know what it is
if it's not money.

14:56.163 --> 14:59.232
Well, someone wants Kyla out
of power at Moore House Tech.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.501
Maybe it's Raiden,
maybe someone who's paying him

15:01.634 --> 15:03.736
more than $7 million
to make sure it happens.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.473
Kyla is the face of the company.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.008
Without her,
it takes a big hit.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.343
You think a competitor
put Raiden up to this?

15:10.477 --> 15:12.245
I don't know.

15:12.379 --> 15:16.749
I'm just a guy
on too many muscle relaxers.

15:16.883 --> 15:17.850
And if I were you,

15:17.985 --> 15:19.719
I'd find out.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.928
Hey. I wanted to ask you...

15:29.062 --> 15:30.197
I've already got Taylor
looking into

15:30.330 --> 15:31.898
Raiden's
professional background.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.433
Seeing if there are any ties

15:33.566 --> 15:35.168
to Moore House Tech competitors.
Oh, that's great.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.737
Um, but I wanted to ask you
about Kyla's emails.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.906
I was going through
the discovery log

15:40.040 --> 15:41.741
and noticed there was
one exchange that got pulled.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.176
That exchange wasn't relevant
to the case.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.345
Okay, well, I ask
because it was already

15:45.445 --> 15:46.379
within the parameters...
It's not relevant.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.780
You know what is?

15:47.914 --> 15:49.349
Those racy videos
Kyla sent Raiden.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.751
Any chance you can
get them suppressed?

15:51.884 --> 15:53.553
Well, we can try,
but I think

15:53.686 --> 15:54.754
we'll lose that fight.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.456
I figured as much.

15:56.589 --> 15:57.957
They're gonna come out anyway,

15:58.091 --> 15:59.459
I just wish we could
control the narrative.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.528
Well...

16:01.628 --> 16:03.396
maybe we can.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.603
You have been a very,
very bad boy, Raiden.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.240
I'm gonna have to punish you.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.608
You know that, don't you?

16:15.742 --> 16:20.147
First, I am gonna take off
all your clothes.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.115
Then, I'm gonna tie you
to the bed.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.486
You won't resist me because...

16:26.619 --> 16:28.088
I own you.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.324
Don't ever forget that.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.329
This is one of three videos
that my client, Kyla Moore,

16:36.463 --> 16:38.265
left for Raiden Parks.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.666
Now, Ms. Moore

16:39.799 --> 16:42.469
admits to having
a consensual sexual affair

16:42.602 --> 16:44.003
with Mr. Parks

16:44.137 --> 16:46.939
in which they engaged
in occasional role-play games.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.409
Ms. Moore denies knowing

16:49.509 --> 16:50.810
that Mr. Parks worked for her

16:50.943 --> 16:52.145
during the time
of their relationship,

16:52.279 --> 16:54.947
nor did she coerce him
in any way.

16:55.082 --> 16:56.683
And we look forward
to proving

16:56.816 --> 16:59.186
that Mr. Parks' allegations
of sexual harassment

16:59.319 --> 17:00.987
are completely false.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.291
One at a time, please.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.693
Oscar, are you okay
with your wife's affair?

17:06.826 --> 17:09.762
Kyla and I have been married
for almost two decades.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.864
We are deeply committed

17:11.998 --> 17:13.266
to each other.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.268
In fact, we trust
each other so much

17:15.368 --> 17:16.869
that a couple of years ago

17:17.003 --> 17:18.805
we decided to open up
our marriage.

17:18.938 --> 17:21.541
So, yes, I am okay

17:21.674 --> 17:22.675
with her affair.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.277
What I am not okay with is

17:24.377 --> 17:26.346
her being slandered
and extorted.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.318
Ugh.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.052
Well, that was smart of Chunk

17:33.186 --> 17:35.122
to have the supportive husband
there.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.323
Okay.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.057
Ow! What was that?

17:38.191 --> 17:39.792
Well, you said
to really dig in...

17:39.892 --> 17:42.129
No, I know, but it didn't mean
"use a shovel."

17:42.229 --> 17:43.796
It really hurts.
All right.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.498
Okay. No, I liked
what you were doing.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.033
I just didn't like that part.
Mm.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.735
Can you come back and
just not do that one?

17:48.868 --> 17:51.404
Hmm.
Thank you.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.207
I wonder if excessive whining
was what led to

17:54.341 --> 17:56.743
their open marriage?

17:56.876 --> 17:59.179
Oh, should I be worried?

17:59.312 --> 18:00.747
Do you need
more excitement

18:00.880 --> 18:02.882
than massaging
your invalid husband?

18:03.015 --> 18:05.752
God no.
And who has the time or energy

18:05.885 --> 18:08.020
for more than one partner?
Or the core strength.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.224
I'm gonna get you
another ice pack.

18:11.358 --> 18:13.160
Thank you.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.262
It feels good.

18:16.396 --> 18:17.430
But...

18:17.564 --> 18:19.732
you know, if we are talking

18:19.866 --> 18:21.768
about bringing more excitement
into our lives,

18:21.901 --> 18:23.603
there is something I would...

18:23.736 --> 18:27.274
I would love.
Okay. Yes.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.376
One night a month.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.444
Dancing.

18:33.012 --> 18:34.447
Oh, yeah.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.882
Okay, uh...

18:36.015 --> 18:37.584
I can't promise that, you know,

18:37.717 --> 18:39.619
I'll be pretty out there
on the floor,

18:39.752 --> 18:41.688
but once I'm back on my feet,
I'm there.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.924
Oh, no. You're not invited.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.626
What do you mean?

18:46.759 --> 18:49.128
You hate dancing,
and I hate dancing with someone

18:49.262 --> 18:51.564
who hates dancing.
No, I meant a free pass.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.566
One night a month
where I just get to go dancing

18:53.700 --> 18:55.235
with my friends.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.137
Ooh. Done.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.572
That gives me one night
a month to indulge

18:59.706 --> 19:01.574
in my guilty pleasure.
Hmm.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.243
Do I want to know?

19:03.376 --> 19:05.278
A good game on TV.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.380
Bucket of hot wings.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.316
No judgment.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.429
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

19:22.562 --> 19:23.996
I want another one. Come on.

19:26.799 --> 19:27.900
Everything okay?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.336
Why do you ask?

19:29.469 --> 19:30.837
Well, it's been a few hours

19:30.970 --> 19:32.339
since you finished
talking to everybody,

19:32.472 --> 19:33.640
and here you still are.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.675
Well, maybe I like it here.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.247
Hey, if I wanted
a necklace like that,

19:40.347 --> 19:41.648
where would I get it?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.916
Nepal, at a puja ceremony.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.752
Puja.
Mm-hmm.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.120
At the base of Everest.
You know about it?

19:48.255 --> 19:51.157
A Tibetan lama blesses the climb

19:51.291 --> 19:53.360
before you go up the mountain,
right?

19:53.493 --> 19:54.494
That's right. Yeah.
Ah.

19:54.627 --> 19:55.662
He gave me this.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.464
Wait, you've climbed Everest?

19:57.597 --> 19:59.165
Not quite.
Got most of the way up,

19:59.299 --> 20:00.467
then another team
got in trouble.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.502
We had to help them down.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.472
Then some bad weather set in,
and that was that.

20:05.605 --> 20:06.706
You climb?

20:06.839 --> 20:08.941
No. I wish.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.710
I'm just interested.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.712
Man, to get that close
to the top

20:12.845 --> 20:13.846
and not make it.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.448
That's got to be hard.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.883
When you're on the mountain,
you're not in control.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.217
The mountain is.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.886
Just got to accept it.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.621
Who says?

20:24.857 --> 20:26.058
One more!

20:26.192 --> 20:28.395
Yeah, I'm afraid that's it.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.696
Wait, wait. N-No.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.298
You're cutting me off?

20:31.398 --> 20:32.399
Let me get you a cab.

20:32.532 --> 20:33.733
Ah.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.502
No, thank you.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.169
Let me. You've had
a bit too much to drink.
No.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.238
I'm nothing. Okay? I'm great.

20:39.372 --> 20:42.575
I won the lottery this morning.
That's how I got this.

20:42.709 --> 20:43.876
You said you hurt it
playing racquetball.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.412
Whatever, man. I am fine.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.680
I don't need your help.
I'm fine.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.582
Okay. You're fine.

20:56.323 --> 20:59.258
Uh, thanks, Taylor.
Text me if anything pops up.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.494
They leaked it.
What?

21:01.594 --> 21:03.029
Our settlement offer.

21:03.162 --> 21:04.764
Retaliation for
the press conference, I bet.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.999
They're trying to make Raiden
look like a saint,

21:07.099 --> 21:09.235
like he walked away
from $7 million

21:09.369 --> 21:10.770
to protect future victims.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.505
They're gonna see this,
and going after him

21:12.605 --> 21:13.940
about overdue
child support payments

21:14.073 --> 21:15.608
isn't gonna move
the needle.
Yep.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.744
Seven million would buy
a lot of school lunches.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.579
Please tell me that
Taylor found some connection

21:19.712 --> 21:22.081
between Raiden and one of
Moore House Tech's competitors.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.116
No obvious link.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.419
Uh, Raiden mainly worked
in academia

21:26.553 --> 21:27.887
before the Moore House Tech gig.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.522
What about Danny?
Anything from the bar?

21:29.622 --> 21:33.125
No one willing to say that
Raiden targeted Kyla directly.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.596
Just gonna have to go after
Raiden with what I got.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.398
Which is?

21:38.531 --> 21:40.467
My wit and charm.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.637
It took me a long time
to admit I was being harassed.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.373
Abused.

21:46.473 --> 21:49.376
As a man, that's a hard thing
to wrap your head around.

21:49.476 --> 21:53.380
But my therapist helped me work
up the courage to confront Kyla.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.248
So I told her
I wasn't gonna meet her

21:56.383 --> 21:57.817
in her hotel suite anymore.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.587
And did the defendant accept no
for an answer?

22:00.720 --> 22:02.321
No.

22:02.455 --> 22:03.656
That's when she started coming
to the satellite office

22:03.790 --> 22:04.957
where I was working.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.494
She'd corner me
and demand that I go

22:07.627 --> 22:10.463
into the storage closet
with her and...

22:13.132 --> 22:15.301
...perform oral sex on her.

22:17.136 --> 22:19.839
That's not true.
Try not to react.

22:19.972 --> 22:22.274
Why not simply refuse
to go in the closet with her?

22:22.409 --> 22:23.843
She said if I didn't give her
what she wanted,

22:23.976 --> 22:25.277
she'd fire me.

22:25.412 --> 22:26.613
I needed the job.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.781
But I started having
these panic attacks,

22:28.915 --> 22:29.782
worrying about

22:29.916 --> 22:31.518
when she'd come for me next.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.686
So eventually I did refuse.

22:33.820 --> 22:37.256
And true to her word,
she fired me.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.159
Why did you decide
to bring this lawsuit?

22:40.292 --> 22:42.328
I have two young sons.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.431
I just can't stand the thought
that someone could do this

22:44.531 --> 22:45.998
to one of them someday.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.834
I couldn't stay silent.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.669
No further questions,
Your Honor.

22:50.637 --> 22:53.039
We just lost another one.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.708
BULL
Should I even look?

22:55.842 --> 22:57.844
That depends. Are you
a glutton for punishment?

22:57.977 --> 23:00.847
I'm a grown man,

23:00.980 --> 23:03.182
using a foam roller
on the floor

23:03.315 --> 23:04.684
in front of my employees.

23:04.817 --> 23:07.119
I'm a glutton for something.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.489
You said that
Kyla Moore fired you.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.624
But, in fact,
you left Moore House Tech

23:11.724 --> 23:13.192
when your six-month contract

23:13.325 --> 23:15.662
as a freelance coder
came to its natural end.

23:15.795 --> 23:16.829
Isn't that correct?

23:16.963 --> 23:18.565
Well, I was hired
as a freelancer.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.800
But when Kyla coerced me
into sleeping with her,

23:20.900 --> 23:23.736
she promised she'd make
my position permanent.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.639
When I broke things off,
that went away.

23:26.739 --> 23:30.009
Do you have any written proof
that Ms. Moore altered

23:30.142 --> 23:31.978
the terms of
your employment contract?

23:32.078 --> 23:34.747
No.
Do you have any proof
that she forced you

23:34.881 --> 23:36.549
in a supply closet?

23:36.683 --> 23:38.150
Security camera footage,
perhaps?

23:38.250 --> 23:39.686
It was her company,
I mean, she knew

23:39.819 --> 23:41.521
how to avoid the cameras.
What about witnesses?

23:41.654 --> 23:44.090
If she came to your workspace
as frequently as you claim,

23:44.223 --> 23:45.492
surely one of your colleagues

23:45.592 --> 23:46.726
would've seen
the two of you together?

23:46.859 --> 23:48.861
She was always very careful.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.196
Having sex

23:50.329 --> 23:52.064
in a supply closet at work

23:52.198 --> 23:53.533
doesn't sound careful to me.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.768
No, in fact, Mr. Parks,

23:55.902 --> 23:59.238
it sounds to me like your story
just doesn't add up.

23:59.371 --> 24:00.673
Objection. Inflammatory.

24:00.773 --> 24:01.941
Counsel is testifying.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.275
Sustained.

24:03.409 --> 24:05.211
Watch your step, Mr. Palmer.

24:05.344 --> 24:06.746
Mr. Parks, you don't have

24:06.879 --> 24:08.515
a single shred of evidence
that proves

24:08.615 --> 24:10.683
that Ms. Moore knew
you were her employee

24:10.783 --> 24:12.952
when you were having a
consensual sexual relationship,

24:13.085 --> 24:13.953
do you?

24:14.086 --> 24:15.221
Yes, I do.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.424
I have her email.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.128
Your Honor,

24:22.261 --> 24:23.596
we went through
Ms. Moore's emails

24:23.730 --> 24:26.566
and there wasn't
a single email to Mr. Parks.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.100
Your Honor,

24:28.234 --> 24:30.102
I have the email
in question right here.

24:30.236 --> 24:35.407
It's from Kittyky1999@AOL.com

24:35.542 --> 24:37.577
from the defendant's
personal account.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.311
I haven't used that account
since college.

24:39.445 --> 24:40.913
It's where I send
all my spam.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.715
The plaintiff did not provide
any of these

24:42.815 --> 24:45.117
for discovery, and we have not
had a chance to review it.

24:45.251 --> 24:47.153
Defense has access to
their client's

24:47.286 --> 24:48.655
personal emails.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.489
It's not Mr. Parks' fault
that they missed it.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.324
Your Honor...
And Mr. Palmer asked

24:52.458 --> 24:53.793
if Mr. Parks has proof.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.795
He should be allowed
to present his proof.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.769
I'll allow it.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.640
Go ahead, Mr. Parks.

25:07.774 --> 25:10.076
"Ray, I can't stop
thinking about you.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.644
"I've never felt this way
for anyone,

25:11.778 --> 25:13.846
not even my husband."

25:13.980 --> 25:15.114
I didn't write that.

25:15.247 --> 25:16.182
That's not me.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.483
"I need you right now.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.418
"Meet me at the Arlo
in an hour.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.820
"Don't say no this time,

25:20.953 --> 25:23.322
or I'll be forced
to punish you at work."

25:27.326 --> 25:28.595
I'm done defending you.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.296
Oscar.

25:30.429 --> 25:31.964
I want order in this court.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.467
Order!
What's happening?

25:35.602 --> 25:37.604
Oh, son of a bitch.

25:38.671 --> 25:39.639
Was this the email you pulled?

25:39.772 --> 25:40.940
I need to go after Kyla.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.041
Order!

25:42.174 --> 25:44.376
Marissa.
Taylor, talk to me.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.278
Mr. Palmer,
get control of your client.
Tell me what's happening.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.214
Pretty sure
all hell is breaking loose.

25:56.022 --> 25:57.624
I have never
seen Oscar that angry.

25:57.724 --> 26:00.660
Well, that's probably him.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.563
No. The board is meeting
to discuss my position.

26:04.697 --> 26:05.798
They want me to resign.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.533
Just go home, lay low.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.335
We will get to the bottom
of all of this.

26:09.468 --> 26:11.370
Thank you.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.208
Take me home.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.247
If you're trying
to protect your friend,

26:21.380 --> 26:22.815
you're doing a lousy job.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.316
What?

26:24.416 --> 26:26.418
You pulled that email
from discovery, didn't you?

26:26.552 --> 26:28.054
Do you think I am that stupid?

26:28.187 --> 26:30.823
To try and cover up an email
the other side received?

26:30.923 --> 26:32.191
I know you're hiding something.

26:32.324 --> 26:33.760
You pulled an email.
What was it?

26:33.893 --> 26:36.996
It was an email
I wrote about you, okay?

26:37.096 --> 26:38.865
What?

26:38.998 --> 26:41.834
I pulled it because
I was trying to protect you.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.770
After Benny left,
I emailed Kyla

26:43.903 --> 26:45.571
to see if she knew
any good attorneys.

26:45.705 --> 26:48.440
I wasn't sure if you were up
to the job of chief counsel.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.542
You have doubts
about my abilities?

26:50.677 --> 26:52.411
I did, then.

26:52.544 --> 26:55.381
I don't anymore, but clearly you
have doubts about my integrity.

26:55.514 --> 26:57.449
It's my ass that's on the line
as the lawyer,

26:57.583 --> 26:59.451
and Kyla is your friend.

26:59.585 --> 27:01.087
People do stupid stuff
for their friends.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.254
Clearly.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.690
Look, just next time

27:03.790 --> 27:05.725
give me a little bit of credit,
okay?

27:05.858 --> 27:07.393
My ego is not that fragile.

27:07.526 --> 27:09.361
Okay.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.130
Done.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.635
Kyla didn't write that email,
you know.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.237
If she didn't write it,
who did?

27:18.370 --> 27:19.972
Raiden or whoever
he's working for.

27:20.106 --> 27:21.440
Think about it.

27:21.573 --> 27:23.475
Why would Kyla tell us
about those videos

27:23.609 --> 27:24.744
but hide that email?

27:24.877 --> 27:26.045
It's the smoking gun.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.379
It proves she knew
Raiden worked for her.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.715
That's the problem.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.249
At the last minute,
they pull out

27:30.382 --> 27:32.218
exactly what Raiden needs
to prove his case.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.220
I think he faked the email.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.790
Well, unless we can prove it,
Kyla's done.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.629
Marissa wants to see us.

27:43.763 --> 27:44.731
You okay?

27:44.831 --> 27:46.632
Someone took out my brain

27:46.766 --> 27:48.600
and replaced it
with broken glass,

27:48.735 --> 27:50.737
but other than that I'm good.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.338
What happened?

27:52.471 --> 27:53.840
Nothing.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.908
Just a little too much fun.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.509
Let's go.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.648
The email wasn't fabricated.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.751
It definitely came
from Kyla's computer.

28:04.851 --> 28:06.318
Well,
Raiden's a coder, right?

28:06.452 --> 28:08.120
Maybe he hacked her system,

28:08.254 --> 28:09.789
or whoever put him
up to this did.

28:09.922 --> 28:12.524
Uh, if I can find
evidence of a hack,

28:12.658 --> 28:14.526
I might be able to work
backwards to whoever did it,

28:14.660 --> 28:16.462
but I'll need access
to Kyla's servers.

28:16.595 --> 28:18.197
Well, they're at her house.
I can get you in.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.332
Danny, can you go with her?

28:20.466 --> 28:22.001
See if there are any signs
of a break-in.

28:22.134 --> 28:24.536
Someone may have tried to get
to the servers directly.

28:24.670 --> 28:25.671
Sure.

28:25.805 --> 28:26.806
Excuse me.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.474
Sorry to interrupt.
I'm, uh,

28:28.607 --> 28:29.708
looking for her.

28:29.842 --> 28:32.979
I'll check in with you both
later.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.947
What's up?
You, um...

28:35.047 --> 28:36.849
left your credit card
at the bar last night.

28:36.983 --> 28:39.351
Oh.

28:39.485 --> 28:40.686
Thanks.

28:40.820 --> 28:41.788
How'd you find me?

28:41.888 --> 28:43.322
You told me where you worked.

28:43.455 --> 28:44.891
Twice.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.859
Oh.
I wanted to make sure

28:46.993 --> 28:48.027
you're okay,

28:48.160 --> 28:49.361
since I couldn't get you
that cab.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.864
Yeah. I'm-I'm good.

28:51.998 --> 28:53.833
Thank you.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.167
How's the mysterious
shoulder injury treating you?

28:55.301 --> 28:56.168
You know, it's...

28:56.302 --> 28:57.203
it's better.

28:57.336 --> 28:58.570
It's getting better.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.473
Okay then.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.142
I'll, uh...

29:03.242 --> 29:05.044
I'll go, I guess.

29:10.549 --> 29:13.152
You ever hear
the phrase "climbing heavy"?

29:13.252 --> 29:14.220
No.

29:14.353 --> 29:15.855
It's when a climber's having

29:15.988 --> 29:17.389
a tougher time with a route
than they should be.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.525
They're out of shape,
or their head's not in it.

29:19.658 --> 29:20.860
Usually because
they're distracted

29:20.993 --> 29:21.928
by something.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.695
Are you saying that's me?

29:23.830 --> 29:25.264
You looked that way last night.

29:25.397 --> 29:26.432
For whatever it's worth.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.035
Anyway,

29:29.168 --> 29:30.402
you got your card.

29:30.536 --> 29:31.737
See you.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.279
Um, we should
get to Kyla's house.

29:40.412 --> 29:42.048
Absolutely.

29:45.351 --> 29:46.618
Checked all the entrances

29:46.752 --> 29:48.387
and the, uh, security footage.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.856
There's no sign
anyone broke in.

29:49.956 --> 29:51.190
How are you doing?

29:51.290 --> 29:53.225
I'm fighting
with the bloody smart sensors

29:53.359 --> 29:55.862
bloody Kyla and Oscar
installed everywhere

29:55.962 --> 29:58.597
in this bloody house
that for some bloody reason

29:58.730 --> 30:01.600
don't want me to have
access to the servers.

30:01.733 --> 30:03.569
Smart sensors?

30:03.702 --> 30:06.238
They track your heartbeat,
insulin level.

30:06.372 --> 30:07.974
Practically read your mind.
I'd think they were amazing

30:08.107 --> 30:09.708
if they weren't making me
so miserable.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.410
Oh.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.579
Who was that guy today?

30:14.947 --> 30:16.382
Bartender from last night.

30:17.283 --> 30:18.650
Pretty sweet as bartenders go.

30:18.784 --> 30:20.586
Bringing you your card and all.

30:21.587 --> 30:22.621
Yep.

30:23.589 --> 30:24.590
Seems like a nice guy.

30:24.723 --> 30:26.225
Can we just not talk about him?

30:26.325 --> 30:28.594
Can we not talk
about anything?

30:28.727 --> 30:30.897
Can we just do the job
and not talk?
Fine.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.164
We don't have to talk about it,

30:32.298 --> 30:33.632
but when even bartenders
are asking

30:33.765 --> 30:35.467
if you're okay,
you might take the hint.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.003
You don't look good.

30:37.136 --> 30:38.504
I don't know what's going on,
but something is,

30:38.637 --> 30:39.972
and you should talk to somebody
about it.

30:40.106 --> 30:41.173
Because this whole "I'm Danny,

30:41.307 --> 30:43.109
nothing bothers me" thing
is bull.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.777
And I know it sounds like it,
but I don't mean that as a pun.

30:46.745 --> 30:48.414
I'm sorry.

30:49.415 --> 30:51.117
I didn't mean to...

30:51.250 --> 30:53.519
I-I'm just hungover.

30:53.652 --> 30:55.287
Whatever you say.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.196
This is weird.

31:04.330 --> 31:05.864
What?

31:05.998 --> 31:08.367
I'm not seeing
any signs of a hack, but...

31:08.500 --> 31:11.337
look at the sensor readings
when the email was sent.

31:11.470 --> 31:14.140
See Kyla's heartbeat?
It's under 60 beats per minute.

31:14.273 --> 31:15.707
She was asleep.

31:16.775 --> 31:18.777
That means Marissa was right.
She couldn't have sent it.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.947
Uh-huh.
But look at Oscar's.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.848
120?

31:22.982 --> 31:25.384
He's not just awake,
he's jacked up.

31:25.517 --> 31:26.452
We've been looking
for the person

31:26.552 --> 31:27.853
who put Raiden up to it,

31:27.987 --> 31:29.655
maybe he's been under our nose
the whole time.

31:29.788 --> 31:31.657
We got to find something that
connects Raiden and Oscar.

31:31.790 --> 31:33.960
You think Oscar wrote the email?

31:34.060 --> 31:35.461
Our investigators discovered

31:35.561 --> 31:38.230
that Oscar and Raiden
know each other.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.466
Oscar was a professor in
Raiden's study abroad program.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.868
Study abroad.
That was over 20 years ago.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.370
They were also
at the same tech conference

31:44.503 --> 31:46.038
in Vegas

31:46.172 --> 31:49.208
a month before Raiden started
working for Moore House.

31:49.341 --> 31:50.309
And sleeping with you.

31:50.409 --> 31:51.310
You think they

31:51.410 --> 31:52.578
bumped into each other,

31:52.711 --> 31:54.880
started reminiscing
about old times,

31:55.014 --> 31:56.215
and then, what,

31:56.348 --> 31:58.250
decided to ruin my life for fun?

31:58.384 --> 32:00.919
Oscar knew when you would be
at the Siren Room.

32:01.053 --> 32:03.022
He knows Auden is
your favorite poet.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.690
He knows all your passwords.

32:04.823 --> 32:05.924
No. There's got to be
another explanation.

32:06.058 --> 32:07.526
It doesn't make any sense.

32:07.659 --> 32:10.596
If I pay, Oscar pays.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.231
But the board just gave him
your job.

32:12.364 --> 32:14.933
My husband loves me.

32:15.067 --> 32:17.069
He started out as your mentor.

32:17.203 --> 32:19.205
Now he's in your shadow, Kyla.

32:19.338 --> 32:22.241
Oscar would never,
never do this to me!

32:27.913 --> 32:29.781
Are you sure you're gonna
be okay without me?

32:29.915 --> 32:33.185
Oh, yeah. You go
and dance the night away.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.121
I've...

32:35.254 --> 32:36.955
Wait a second.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.625
Are you sure you can't just
stay home and take care of me?

32:39.758 --> 32:41.227
Anybody missing
a bucket of hot wings?

32:41.360 --> 32:43.462
Oh, in here.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.531
These were right
outside your door.

32:45.631 --> 32:46.532
Which was wide open?

32:46.632 --> 32:48.634
Well, I was worried that

32:48.767 --> 32:50.969
I wouldn't be able to get
to the door, so...

32:51.103 --> 32:52.638
I thought these wings were
supposed to come

32:52.771 --> 32:54.306
without judgment.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.108
I assume this isn't
a social call.

32:56.242 --> 32:57.809
We showed Kyla the evidence,

32:57.943 --> 32:58.977
but she refuses to believe it.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.379
Won't let us use it.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.713
And we're sunk if we
can't show the jury

33:01.813 --> 33:03.582
that Oscar put Raiden
up to this.

33:03.715 --> 33:05.317
Kyla's husband is behind this?

33:06.218 --> 33:08.054
I'm looking better
and better, aren't I?

33:08.154 --> 33:10.889
I know this is a horrible thing
for Kyla to have to accept,

33:10.989 --> 33:12.324
but the evidence is
pretty clear.

33:12.458 --> 33:13.592
I don't know
how else to prove it to her.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.394
Mind if I get that...

33:15.494 --> 33:17.796
Yes, I do.
When Jason was accused of
jury tampering,

33:17.929 --> 33:19.565
there's no evidence

33:19.665 --> 33:21.133
that would've convinced me
he was guilty.

33:21.267 --> 33:23.469
He would've had to
confess to me himself.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.838
Well, then, I guess you're gonna
have to get Oscar to confess.

33:36.448 --> 33:37.649
You really believe this?

33:37.783 --> 33:39.451
Because of an
elevated heart rate

33:39.585 --> 33:43.355
and some decades-old
study abroad trip?

33:43.489 --> 33:45.257
I don't even remember the guy.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.492
This is ridiculous.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.960
I assure you I am serious.

33:49.095 --> 33:52.164
You are facing charges of
conspiracy to commit fraud,

33:52.298 --> 33:53.165
identity theft,

33:53.299 --> 33:54.866
federal wire fraud.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.368
You could be looking at

33:56.502 --> 33:58.537
spending the rest of your life
behind bars.

34:06.312 --> 34:07.479
What's Raiden doing here?

34:07.613 --> 34:08.880
Chunk reached out
to a friend of his

34:09.014 --> 34:10.048
who works in the D.A.'s office.

34:10.182 --> 34:11.317
He's on his way over.

34:11.450 --> 34:13.385
Whoever talks first
will get immunity

34:13.519 --> 34:14.853
in exchange for testifying

34:14.986 --> 34:16.322
against their coconspirator.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.357
Yeah, well, I'm not talking

34:18.490 --> 34:20.559
because there's nothing to say.

34:20.692 --> 34:21.560
Do you trust Raiden

34:21.693 --> 34:23.729
to keep his mouth shut

34:23.862 --> 34:27.133
when he learns how many years
he could spend in prison?

34:29.735 --> 34:32.504
I thought we were here
to discuss a new settlement.

34:32.638 --> 34:35.641
Did I say that?
I'm sorry. No.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.544
We are here because Raiden
and Oscar are gonna play a game

34:38.677 --> 34:40.078
of prisoner's dilemma.

34:40.212 --> 34:41.347
And if Raiden can win,

34:41.480 --> 34:42.481
he might be able
to avoid prison.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.150
What are you talking about?

34:44.250 --> 34:45.751
You want to tell her about
the conspiracy you have

34:45.884 --> 34:48.354
with Oscar Moore,
or should I?

34:49.921 --> 34:51.390
You know me.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.227
I love Kyla.

34:55.361 --> 34:57.363
How could you ever think

34:57.496 --> 35:00.532
that I would do
something so cruel?

35:00.666 --> 35:02.701
I think you were hurt.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.405
And you wanted her
to hurt, too.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.275
What was it?

35:09.408 --> 35:11.743
That her ideas
always eclipsed yours?

35:12.911 --> 35:14.446
That she got
all the attention?

35:14.580 --> 35:16.548
Were you sick of just being
Kyla Moore's husband?

35:18.417 --> 35:19.885
Was I even that?

35:21.553 --> 35:25.056
My wife was sleeping
with other men.

35:25.191 --> 35:28.694
Because she thought you wanted
to sleep with other women.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.562
She was trying to save
your marriage.

35:30.696 --> 35:34.466
Then she should have
let me be the man

35:34.600 --> 35:36.067
for once.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.411
He resented me that much?

35:45.544 --> 35:47.045
I'm so sorry.

35:48.447 --> 35:50.048
Was I supposed to make
myself smaller

35:50.148 --> 35:51.717
to make him feel bigger?
No.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.919
You should never do that.

35:56.755 --> 35:58.324
What can I do to help?

36:02.261 --> 36:03.562
Shut it down.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.731
We're talking to
the D.A.'s office.
No.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.967
I don't want the world to know
my own husband tried to ruin me.

36:10.436 --> 36:12.504
Are you saying that you don't
want Oscar to be punished

36:12.638 --> 36:14.306
for what he's done to you?

36:17.108 --> 36:19.578
I just want you
to make it go away.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.517
Your Honor,

36:25.651 --> 36:28.019
my client would like to
withdraw his complaint.

36:28.153 --> 36:29.688
He has a statement
he'd like to make,

36:29.821 --> 36:31.490
if it please the court.

36:31.623 --> 36:32.858
Go ahead.

36:35.261 --> 36:38.364
The allegations I made against
Kyla Moore were not true.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.767
She never sexually harassed me.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.770
I'd like to apologize to her

36:44.870 --> 36:45.971
and her family

36:46.104 --> 36:47.973
for putting them
through this ordeal.

36:48.106 --> 36:50.642
And I'd also like to
apologize to the court.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.878
Mr. Parks,

36:53.011 --> 36:55.046
are you admitting
that you committed perjury

36:55.180 --> 36:56.482
in my courtroom?

36:57.649 --> 36:59.651
Your Honor, if I may be heard?

36:59.785 --> 37:01.353
I suppose so.

37:01.487 --> 37:04.390
Ms. Moore would like to put
this unpleasant chapter

37:04.523 --> 37:06.658
behind her
as soon as possible.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.193
I've spoken
with the D.A.'s office,

37:08.327 --> 37:09.895
and we've worked out a deal

37:10.028 --> 37:12.298
whereby Mr. Parks
would do 200 hours

37:12.398 --> 37:13.699
of community service
in exchange

37:13.832 --> 37:16.134
for pleading guilty to perjury.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.670
We don't want to waste
any more of the court's time.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.709
Mr. Parks,

37:23.842 --> 37:25.911
you got off easy.

37:26.044 --> 37:27.413
But you had better hope

37:27.546 --> 37:29.381
that I never see you
in my courtroom again.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.519
This case is adjourned.

37:46.231 --> 37:47.599
I'm supposed to be dead.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.836
Funny. You don't look dead.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.840
A guy pointed a gun
at my head,

37:54.940 --> 37:57.275
pulled the trigger...

37:58.377 --> 37:59.511
That's supposed to kill you.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.212
But it didn't.

38:01.347 --> 38:02.714
Nope.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.550
The gun misfired.

38:05.617 --> 38:06.552
Here I am.

38:06.685 --> 38:09.187
That's a good thing. Right?

38:09.287 --> 38:10.422
Considering the alternative.

38:11.423 --> 38:12.591
Yeah.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.059
I guess.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.630
I just, I haven't felt right
about it since it happened,

38:18.764 --> 38:20.298
and I can't talk to my friends
about it.

38:20.432 --> 38:21.700
Why not?

38:22.734 --> 38:24.936
I need something to be
different.

38:26.872 --> 38:30.642
If I got a second chance
for whatever reason,

38:30.776 --> 38:33.645
something's got to change.

38:33.779 --> 38:36.247
My life, my-my job.

38:36.382 --> 38:37.449
Something.

38:37.583 --> 38:40.151
Then why are you telling me?

38:40.285 --> 38:42.287
Dude, I don't know.
You climbed Everest.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.991
I only got halfway.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.593
But...

38:47.726 --> 38:49.294
I think I've got something
that will help.

38:55.601 --> 38:57.002
You're-you're giving me coffee?

38:57.135 --> 38:58.269
Oh, do not tell me

38:58.404 --> 38:59.771
you're a tea person.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.840
No, this is, this is good.

39:05.243 --> 39:06.445
What's this?

39:06.578 --> 39:09.180
This is a topo map
of Mount Marcy.

39:09.314 --> 39:10.682
It's up in the Adirondacks.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.684
A few of us are climbing it
this weekend.

39:12.818 --> 39:14.586
It's not exactly

39:14.686 --> 39:17.456
Mount Everest--
pretty easy walk-- but...

39:17.589 --> 39:18.524
from the peak

39:18.657 --> 39:19.991
you can see for miles.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.528
It's like the whole world's laid
at your feet.

39:24.262 --> 39:25.764
You want to come along?

39:26.832 --> 39:28.834
I don't know your name.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.335
It's Cameron.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.270
Danny.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.039
I know.
I saw your credit card.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.607
Right.
Cameron!

39:35.707 --> 39:39.545
Oh, um, I got to get this guy,
but, uh...

39:39.678 --> 39:41.547
think about it.

39:55.293 --> 39:58.864
Well, Oscar's the one
who got off easy, if you ask me.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.966
In six months,
Kyla will file for divorce,

40:01.066 --> 40:03.401
and Oscar will
step down as CFO.

40:03.535 --> 40:06.171
And he'll be riding out his time
in their house in Aspen.

40:06.304 --> 40:07.906
It's a gilded prison.

40:08.039 --> 40:10.408
I bet you wish
he was behind real bars.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.310
This is what Kyla wants.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.546
Her heart's broken,
but at least she walks away

40:14.680 --> 40:16.515
with her dignity intact.

40:16.648 --> 40:18.083
Yeah.

40:18.216 --> 40:20.251
At least someone got
to keep their dignity.

40:21.720 --> 40:25.090
Those muscle relaxers
were powerful.

40:25.223 --> 40:27.158
Was it as bad as I remember?
It wasn't so...

40:27.258 --> 40:28.527
Worse.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.061
Hmm.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.162
Well, thank you for keeping
the ship afloat

40:31.262 --> 40:32.698
while I was lost at sea.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.768
You know, I forgot how good it
feels to just stand up straight.

40:36.902 --> 40:38.504
I'm gonna go try the stairs.

40:38.604 --> 40:39.771
See you in the morning.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.339
See ya.

40:46.377 --> 40:49.447
You ever think we could run
this place on our own?

40:49.581 --> 40:52.250
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

40:52.383 --> 40:54.620
And with a better name
than TAC.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.755
Actually, TAC was my idea.

40:57.723 --> 41:00.692
And by better,
I mean TAC is perfect.

41:00.792 --> 41:03.128
What were you thinking?
No.

41:03.261 --> 41:04.796
TAC's great.

41:04.930 --> 41:05.964
Really.

41:08.634 --> 41:10.468
It was nice working with you,
friend.

41:10.602 --> 41:11.970
Right back at you.

41:13.705 --> 41:15.741
and TOYOTA.
