WEBVTT

00:09.890 --> 00:12.825
I need you to sign something.

00:12.860 --> 00:14.460
What you got?

00:14.494 --> 00:16.128
Okay.

00:18.465 --> 00:19.943
Jordan, I was supposed
to sign this a week ago.

00:19.967 --> 00:21.334
How come I'm just now getting it?

00:21.368 --> 00:22.602
I forgot.

00:22.636 --> 00:24.437
And it's all C's.

00:24.471 --> 00:25.982
You're a smarter kid than this, Jordan.

00:26.006 --> 00:27.450
This doesn't even look
like your report card.

00:27.474 --> 00:28.975
Are you gonna sign it, or what?

00:31.044 --> 00:33.446
I'm signing. But understand, Jordan.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.791
It's been a rough couple of weeks,

00:34.815 --> 00:36.282
but there's no excuse for this.

00:36.316 --> 00:37.516
There's no...

00:39.152 --> 00:41.020
Listen.

00:41.054 --> 00:44.490
We will talk about that later. Okay?

00:44.524 --> 00:46.592
All right?

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074

00:58.950 --> 01:00.550
Anything new with Antonio?

01:00.618 --> 01:04.187
No, but I still want
to keep an eye on him.

01:04.254 --> 01:06.267
Got a search warrant for the
residence of Marshall Carter.

01:06.291 --> 01:08.091
He's the head of the Night Lords.

01:08.159 --> 01:10.137
He's got priors for
possession, aggravated battery.

01:10.161 --> 01:11.761
They deal out of a house in Hegewisch.

01:11.830 --> 01:12.996
The boonies.

01:13.064 --> 01:14.464
Yeah. My C.I. confirmed

01:14.532 --> 01:16.210
the monthly shipments here
ready for distribution.

01:16.234 --> 01:18.067
Now, here's the thing.
There's an estimated

01:18.136 --> 01:20.181
street value of at least two
mil worth of meth and cocaine

01:20.205 --> 01:21.637
in the dining room.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.806
- How many men?
- At least six.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.575
The address is 238 Five Oaks Road.

01:25.643 --> 01:27.276
Let's hit it.

01:46.831 --> 01:49.332
Chicago PD! Turn around.

01:49.401 --> 01:50.900
- Turn around.
- Get down.

01:50.969 --> 01:52.502
- Spread your legs.
- Clear.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.970
- Wider.
- Hey, we got a runner.

01:54.039 --> 01:57.106
Stay against the wall.
Stay on the ground.

01:59.310 --> 02:00.910
The hell you thought you was going, boy?

02:00.945 --> 02:02.545
Look who it is.

02:02.614 --> 02:04.614
- Mr. Marshall Carter.
- We got him.

02:04.682 --> 02:06.883
That's all of them.

02:06.951 --> 02:09.151
Sit back. Get up.

02:14.793 --> 02:17.560
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

02:35.013 --> 02:36.312
Hey.

02:36.381 --> 02:37.591
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

02:37.615 --> 02:38.981
Little guy, little guy.

02:39.050 --> 02:40.516
Little guy. Hey, where you going?

02:40.585 --> 02:42.063
Where you going? Come here, come here.

02:42.087 --> 02:43.186
It's okay. It's okay.

02:43.254 --> 02:44.687
I got you. I got you.

02:54.332 --> 02:56.732
Anybody else in there, Sarge?

02:56.801 --> 02:58.734
Two kids.

03:03.208 --> 03:05.608
Both dead.

03:16.854 --> 03:19.889
So, the kid's a ghost. Same
with the other two kids.

03:19.957 --> 03:21.423
No one's reported them missing.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.025
I ran facial recognition locally,

03:23.094 --> 03:25.027
nationally, and double
checked with the FBI.

03:25.096 --> 03:26.096
I got nothing.

03:26.097 --> 03:28.030
- They got a name?
- No.

03:28.099 --> 03:30.377
- The kid doesn't speak English.
- I called a few translators.

03:30.401 --> 03:31.934
Maybe we'll get lucky.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.969
Look, the fact is three
kids were held captive.

03:34.038 --> 03:37.673
Two of them are dead.
Someone's gonna pay for this.

03:38.809 --> 03:41.210
- Good work.
- Yeah.

03:41.279 --> 03:42.912
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

04:02.233 --> 04:03.699
I know you don't understand me.

04:03.768 --> 04:06.535
But you are in a safe place.

04:10.141 --> 04:12.041
Vietnam.

04:13.945 --> 04:15.544
You're from Vietnam?

04:17.380 --> 04:19.214
Thank you.

04:24.522 --> 04:26.789
Tell us about the kids in the shelter.

04:26.857 --> 04:28.123
What kids?

04:33.747 --> 04:35.781
A black kid, a white
kid, and an Asian kid

04:35.849 --> 04:37.816
were found in your storm shelter.

04:37.885 --> 04:39.985
I don't know nothing about no kids.

04:40.054 --> 04:41.887
And that creepylooking
shelter ain't mine.

04:41.956 --> 04:43.555
It belongs to the house in the back.

04:49.863 --> 04:52.531
You better hope so.

04:54.668 --> 04:58.036
- Who's your neighbor?
- Hell if I know.

04:59.540 --> 05:01.940
That's the wrong answer, Marshall.

05:02.009 --> 05:03.842
- Excuse me?
- We got you on

05:03.911 --> 05:07.212
distribution,
methamphetamine production,

05:07.281 --> 05:11.850
and until we learn
otherwise, double homicide.

05:11.919 --> 05:13.852
Yeah. I forget to mention

05:13.921 --> 05:16.154
two of the kids are dead?

05:19.159 --> 05:22.093
C.O.D. for both children was
carbon tetrachloride exposure.

05:22.162 --> 05:24.262
It's a solvent used to extract meth.

05:24.331 --> 05:25.964
So they inhaled fumes?

05:26.033 --> 05:28.133
No, there was toxic water
in their stomach contents.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.335
My guess is the drug dealers
dumped the waste products

05:30.404 --> 05:32.771
into the yard and it seeped
into the ground water.

05:32.839 --> 05:34.773
Okay, so, the kids got thirsty,

05:34.841 --> 05:37.142
drank the puddle of water,
they got sick, and died.

05:37.211 --> 05:38.810
Sounds about right.

05:38.879 --> 05:41.580
- Okay, thanks.
- You're welcome.

05:43.483 --> 05:46.451
Hey. So, we did some checking.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.919
Turns out you're right.

05:47.988 --> 05:49.988
Storm shelter belongs to your neighbor.

05:50.057 --> 05:52.257
What'd I say? I admit to the dope,

05:52.326 --> 05:54.292
but I ain't copping to them kids.

05:54.361 --> 05:56.087
I've never been near that shelter.

05:56.088 --> 05:58.307
You can do some CSI crap to prove it.

05:58.467 --> 06:00.326
You wanna know what
that CSI crap proves?

06:00.327 --> 06:02.770
The meth waste you dumped in the yard

06:02.776 --> 06:04.803
seeped into the shelter.

06:04.871 --> 06:06.838
The kids drank it and died.

06:08.575 --> 06:11.076
Wanna guess what that's called?

06:13.880 --> 06:17.215
It's called criminally
negligent homicide.

06:17.283 --> 06:19.283
I'll tell you everything I know.

06:19.352 --> 06:21.085
I got no allegiance to some freak

06:21.154 --> 06:22.754
who's snatching up little kids.

06:22.822 --> 06:24.422
So start talking.

06:24.491 --> 06:26.891
I saw him two times. Both
times, he was with kids.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.762
First time was two girls.
Second time was three boys.

06:30.830 --> 06:32.230
What did he look like?

06:32.298 --> 06:36.868
Tall white dude. Old, like, 50.

06:40.940 --> 06:45.109
His name is Quan Vo. He's from Sapa,

06:45.178 --> 06:46.844
a mountain village in northern Vietnam.

06:46.913 --> 06:49.147
- When did he get to Chicago?
- Six weeks ago.

06:49.215 --> 06:51.883
He was living at an orphanage,
and then he was sent to America

06:51.951 --> 06:53.518
to bless a new family.

06:53.586 --> 06:55.887
Okay, the new family.
Does he know their name?

06:55.955 --> 06:57.855
The only name he knows is "Smith."

06:57.924 --> 07:00.291
He was living with them
up until two days ago.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.160
All right, what happened after that?

07:02.228 --> 07:04.696
That couple, the Smiths,
gave him to another couple,

07:04.764 --> 07:06.342
then that couple gave him to another man

07:06.366 --> 07:08.733
who then locked him up
in some sort of cellar.

07:08.802 --> 07:10.468
Can he describe any of these people?

07:16.276 --> 07:18.142
They were all white.

07:18.211 --> 07:20.511
And, their address. Does
he know where they lived?

07:25.819 --> 07:27.919
No, but it was a tan house.

07:27.987 --> 07:30.822
Near a train.

07:30.890 --> 07:33.725
Near a train?

07:33.793 --> 07:37.862
Has a picture of cats.

07:37.931 --> 07:40.598
And it smelled like Banh Socola Bot Nep.

07:40.667 --> 07:41.677
What is that... What?

07:41.735 --> 07:43.134
Can you say that again?

07:43.203 --> 07:47.202
- Banh Socola Bot Nep.
- Banh Socola...

07:47.273 --> 07:49.574
- And that... What is that?
- Food. A Vietnamese dish.

07:49.642 --> 07:51.075
I've never had it before.

07:51.144 --> 07:53.411
Okay, I'm gonna call
a restaurant and see

07:53.480 --> 07:54.779
if I can get that order.

07:54.848 --> 07:56.047
Copy that.

07:56.316 --> 07:57.782
Tell him, "Thank you."

08:08.394 --> 08:10.962
He wants you to know the
other two kids were alive

08:11.030 --> 08:12.463
when he was first locked up.

08:12.532 --> 08:14.332
He told them not to drink the water,

08:14.400 --> 08:16.334
but they didn't listen.

08:16.402 --> 08:18.502
He tried to save them.

08:28.054 --> 08:31.256
Platt said someone
ordered from Royal Siam?

08:31.291 --> 08:33.424
- Right here.
- Smells delicious.

08:33.460 --> 08:35.461
Okay, the house with the storm shelter's

08:35.495 --> 08:37.261
registered to an LLC in Grand Cayman.

08:37.297 --> 08:39.431
They have about 200
units here in Chicago.

08:39.466 --> 08:41.177
This one was redtagged
for foundation problems.

08:41.201 --> 08:42.433
It should be empty.

08:42.469 --> 08:44.536
So our suspect was squatting.

08:44.571 --> 08:45.871
Sounds like it.

08:45.905 --> 08:48.507
So we got no name,
no number, no nothing.

08:48.541 --> 08:51.009
Unbelievable, it's chocolate.

08:51.044 --> 08:52.678
It's chocolate.

08:52.712 --> 08:54.847
Quan said the house he
lived in smelled like this.

08:54.881 --> 08:56.482
- Hey.
- Sweet.

08:56.516 --> 08:59.651
So, must be around one of
the chocolate factories.

09:02.155 --> 09:03.155
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:03.156 --> 09:04.490
What've we got?

09:04.524 --> 09:05.858
Well, they've been to five houses

09:05.892 --> 09:07.126
owned by people named Smith.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.128
Still no hits, so I don't know.

09:09.162 --> 09:10.295
I guess just keep knocking.

09:10.330 --> 09:12.197
Wait, wait, wait a second.

09:12.232 --> 09:14.700
Quan said there was a picture
of what outside the house?

09:14.734 --> 09:15.734
Cats.

09:15.769 --> 09:17.002
Okay.

09:26.179 --> 09:29.248
Excuse me. Can I help you?

09:29.282 --> 09:31.650
- Yeah. Officer Atwater.
- This is officer Ruzek.

09:31.684 --> 09:33.485
Chicago PD. We were hoping that

09:33.520 --> 09:36.355
you could help us
identify this little boy.

09:37.424 --> 09:40.225
That's my son, Quan. He's adopted.

09:40.260 --> 09:41.827
What's this about?

09:41.861 --> 09:44.496
Hi. What's going on?

09:44.531 --> 09:47.032
It's the police. They're
asking about Quan.

09:49.068 --> 09:51.270
What... Quan was kidnapped?

09:51.304 --> 09:53.205
That's what we're trying to figure out.

09:53.239 --> 09:55.007
Okay. I was away on a business trip.

09:55.041 --> 09:56.708
He... Quan's supposed to be in school.

09:56.743 --> 09:58.944
Right, but he's not.

09:58.978 --> 10:00.579
When was the last time you saw him?

10:02.215 --> 10:03.582
Well, just tell him.

10:03.616 --> 10:05.217
When was the last time you saw Quan?

10:05.251 --> 10:06.718
It was this morning, right?

10:09.989 --> 10:11.390
Two days ago.

10:13.293 --> 10:15.227
Two days ago?

10:17.630 --> 10:18.730
How's that possible?

10:22.836 --> 10:25.037
You know how difficult he was.

10:25.071 --> 10:26.605
All the problems that I was having.

10:26.639 --> 10:28.941
Don't, don't, don't. Stop.

10:28.975 --> 10:31.710
Just tell me what you did.

10:31.744 --> 10:34.246
I... I found a web site,

10:34.280 --> 10:36.748
and there was this really lovely couple.

10:36.783 --> 10:39.551
You gave our son away?

10:39.586 --> 10:41.320
How could you do that? How?

10:41.354 --> 10:42.721
Are you out of your mind?

10:42.755 --> 10:46.124
- How?
- Walk to the kitchen with me.

10:48.261 --> 10:50.596
We're gonna figure this out.

10:54.675 --> 10:57.543
You have to understand
that Quan has issues.

10:57.577 --> 11:00.112
He was always stealing money, food...

11:00.147 --> 11:02.448
It was too much.

11:02.672 --> 11:03.972
But with foreign adoptions,

11:04.007 --> 11:05.908
there's nowhere you can turn for help.

11:05.942 --> 11:07.943
So I started looking for
a support group online.

11:07.977 --> 11:11.613
And that's when I found
this Real Promises web site.

11:12.415 --> 11:15.117
So... You just gave him away?

11:15.151 --> 11:17.252
The orphanage lied to us about him.

11:17.287 --> 11:21.590
We asked for a boy under five,
and instead they sent Quan.

11:21.624 --> 11:24.660
Todd had no idea how bad it was.

11:24.694 --> 11:26.395
He was always working.

11:26.429 --> 11:29.298
I was the one who was home
alone dealing with all of this.

11:29.332 --> 11:31.767
And I was scared. I was...

11:31.801 --> 11:34.136
I was scared that he was
gonna hurt our twin girls.

11:34.170 --> 11:37.306
They're... they're young.
They just turned four.

11:37.340 --> 11:39.841
And you never told your
wife to get rid of him

11:39.876 --> 11:41.577
because he was difficult?

11:41.611 --> 11:42.911
- No.
- Never?

11:42.946 --> 11:44.479
Absolutely not.

11:44.514 --> 11:47.215
Did you ever think she
would do something like this?

11:49.152 --> 11:50.452
Never.

11:50.486 --> 11:54.289
I don't care what my
wife said or what she did.

11:54.324 --> 11:56.058
I love my son.

11:57.193 --> 11:59.761
I would do anything to get him back.

11:59.796 --> 12:01.830
It's not that simple.

12:06.669 --> 12:08.170
Why not?

12:08.204 --> 12:11.373
Your wife gave away a
little boy to two strangers,

12:11.407 --> 12:15.277
who then gave him away to
some tall guy who locked him

12:15.311 --> 12:18.513
in a storm shelter.

12:18.548 --> 12:21.016
That's why not.

12:22.185 --> 12:24.019
So you went to this
Real Promises web site,

12:24.053 --> 12:28.657
you sent a message that said, "We
have a child that needs a new home."

12:28.691 --> 12:30.659
The next day you get
a response from a John

12:30.693 --> 12:32.160
and a Penny Marsden, right?

12:32.195 --> 12:34.162
Yeah, they wanted to meet right away.

12:34.197 --> 12:36.064
When exactly did you meet the Marsdens?

12:36.099 --> 12:39.067
That afternoon at 4:00.

12:39.102 --> 12:40.902
When Quan got home from school.

12:40.937 --> 12:44.973
Right, um... What'd
the Marsdens look like?

12:45.008 --> 12:50.879
Um... The husband was short, and, um...

12:50.913 --> 12:53.682
The wife was just averagelooking.

12:53.716 --> 12:55.183
They were probably both about 40.

12:55.218 --> 12:58.387
Okay. Um... Telephone number?

12:58.421 --> 13:01.256
Address?

13:01.290 --> 13:02.958
No.

13:05.528 --> 13:09.264
You think I'm awful. I know.

13:09.298 --> 13:11.533
To be honest with you,

13:11.567 --> 13:14.236
I don't think it matters
how bad the situation is.

13:14.270 --> 13:18.340
I think it's very extreme to
give a kid away, Mrs. Smith.

13:21.210 --> 13:23.545
So, what Kate Smith did has a name.

13:23.579 --> 13:24.880
It's called "rehoming."

13:24.914 --> 13:26.548
It's called "unforgivable."

13:26.582 --> 13:28.684
Yeah, but it's legal
in the state of Illinois.

13:28.718 --> 13:30.886
Parents can transfer the
care of foreign adoptees

13:30.920 --> 13:32.521
to someone else with
a power of attorney.

13:32.555 --> 13:34.289
It started a few years
back in chat rooms.

13:34.323 --> 13:35.901
What about the web site Kate Smith used?

13:35.925 --> 13:37.225
It's a sham.

13:37.260 --> 13:38.927
It's been around for six months.

13:38.961 --> 13:40.372
The IP address is routed
through the dark net.

13:40.396 --> 13:42.264
And the origin is listed as Iceland.

13:42.298 --> 13:44.399
This Marsden couple does not exist.

13:44.434 --> 13:45.944
There's not a record of
a John or Penny Marsden

13:45.968 --> 13:47.469
in the Chicago land area.

13:47.503 --> 13:49.738
Shocker. A child trafficker
is using fake names.

13:49.772 --> 13:52.240
So we need to make contact.

13:52.275 --> 13:54.876
Find this Marsden couple
and the mystery man

13:54.911 --> 13:56.311
- they gave Quan to.
- Yo, Sarge,

13:56.345 --> 13:58.246
let me and Kim have a shot at him.

13:58.281 --> 13:59.992
We can pose as a couple
wanting to give a kid away.

14:00.016 --> 14:01.493
Send a message out
there to the web site.

14:01.517 --> 14:03.051
I bet we can draw them in.

14:04.520 --> 14:05.987
All right, good.

14:06.022 --> 14:08.256
Hey, I don't want these rehoming punks

14:08.291 --> 14:09.802
thinking we're on to
them, you understand?

14:09.826 --> 14:11.326
- Copy that.
- Yeah.

14:16.432 --> 14:18.266
Got a male driver and a female passenger

14:18.301 --> 14:20.635
in a lightcolored SUV. Illinois tags,

14:20.670 --> 14:22.437
33 John Paul 60.

14:22.472 --> 14:24.072
Copy that.

14:24.107 --> 14:25.774
Vehicle is registered to John Kingsley.

14:25.808 --> 14:27.576
Address listed is the
Tower Lake apartments,

14:27.610 --> 14:30.112
but those were torn down two years ago.

14:30.146 --> 14:31.947
We thought about foreign adoption, too.

14:31.981 --> 14:34.149
But, you know, it all takes money.

14:34.183 --> 14:36.685
- And time.
- I'm tired of waiting.

14:36.719 --> 14:39.121
I wanna be a mother now.

14:39.155 --> 14:41.123
And when I read about your little girl,

14:41.157 --> 14:42.991
I knew that this was meant to be.

14:43.025 --> 14:45.127
Yeah, Penny said she found her angel.

14:45.161 --> 14:47.996
It's true. My heart melted.

14:48.030 --> 14:52.768
So, um, why do you want to give her up?

14:52.802 --> 14:58.807
Trust me, we... we
don't. But, you know with work

14:58.841 --> 15:00.809
- and travel, right?
- Yeah.

15:00.843 --> 15:02.310
We travel so much, I just don't...

15:02.345 --> 15:04.312
I don't think we really can give Naja

15:04.347 --> 15:06.348
- the time she deserves.
- Yeah.

15:06.382 --> 15:08.483
I understand.

15:08.518 --> 15:11.219
Look, you all seem
like really nice people.

15:11.254 --> 15:13.321
But we just wanna make sure

15:13.356 --> 15:15.290
that we don't get into trouble later.

15:15.324 --> 15:17.726
Do you know who started
the Real Promises web site?

15:17.760 --> 15:20.962
No, but it's legal.

15:20.997 --> 15:23.498
I know of a couple
that used it before.

15:23.533 --> 15:26.301
They adopted just a
terrific boy from Russia.

15:26.335 --> 15:27.803
That's so great.

15:27.837 --> 15:29.504
We would love to talk to them.

15:29.539 --> 15:31.640
Gosh, they were friends
of our old neighbors.

15:31.674 --> 15:33.208
I don't remember their names.

15:35.211 --> 15:37.012
Yeah, we understand It happens.

15:37.046 --> 15:42.050
So, um, can we meet Naja?

15:42.084 --> 15:45.253
Sorry about that. Of course you can.

15:45.288 --> 15:47.322
But, how about we
check out the house?

15:47.356 --> 15:49.168
Just real quick. We know
that you have pictures.

15:49.192 --> 15:52.894
We are on two acres.
And it's a little rural

15:52.929 --> 15:54.996
for a lot of folks, but we just love it.

15:55.031 --> 15:56.998
- It's beautiful.
- Wow.

15:57.033 --> 15:59.334
Well, hey, let's check this out now.

15:59.368 --> 16:01.903
- I mean, I'm excited.
- Right now?

16:01.938 --> 16:03.371
- Yeah.
- We don't have time

16:03.406 --> 16:06.374
to drive there and
back. But, um, it is...

16:06.409 --> 16:10.011
- It's a very nice house.
- Yeah, it is.

16:10.046 --> 16:11.423
But we're gonna need to check it out,

16:11.447 --> 16:13.648
and maybe talk to a few references, too.

16:15.251 --> 16:19.187
You know, I don't think
you're ready to do this.

16:20.590 --> 16:24.459
- We should leave, John.
- Thank you.

16:25.928 --> 16:28.897
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

16:28.931 --> 16:30.932
Pleasure.

16:35.438 --> 16:36.705
They're headed out to you.

16:36.739 --> 16:37.973
All right.

16:50.152 --> 16:52.954
Doesn't look like a farm in Rosiclare.

16:52.989 --> 16:56.024
Yeah, I don't see that
tire swing, either.

16:57.994 --> 16:59.461
See that?

17:01.864 --> 17:04.098
Looks like there might be
more than two people in there.

17:04.133 --> 17:07.002
We got another car.

17:07.036 --> 17:09.804
5021 David. Hey, squad,

17:09.839 --> 17:11.906
can you run a Illinois passenger,

17:11.941 --> 17:13.808
brown in color, Range Rover,

17:13.843 --> 17:15.343
710 Zebra 5 Nora?

17:15.377 --> 17:17.945
104. Where can I hold you down?

17:17.980 --> 17:21.016
90 South Confidential.

17:23.152 --> 17:25.453
5021 Baker. Shots fired, send backup.

17:25.488 --> 17:27.656
Be advised, plain clothes
officers responding.

17:27.690 --> 17:29.991
Copy that.

17:32.061 --> 17:34.129
Chicago PD, drop the gun.

17:34.163 --> 17:36.831
Not until he tells me
what he did to Quan.

17:36.866 --> 17:39.200
- Officer, please.
- Todd, don't do this, man.

17:39.235 --> 17:41.102
- Get out, or I'll kill him.
- No, no, just...

17:41.137 --> 17:43.204
Shut up! Lady, just shut up, okay?

17:43.239 --> 17:45.373
- Step back.
- Get out or he's dead.

17:45.408 --> 17:46.975
You tell them. You tell them

17:47.009 --> 17:48.610
what you did to my son.

17:52.515 --> 17:55.317
Go to the back.

17:55.351 --> 17:57.385
Todd, I know you're upset,
but don't do something

17:57.420 --> 17:59.164
- you're gonna regret here.
- It's not worth it.

17:59.188 --> 18:00.866
- Just let us handle this.
- You got other kids.

18:00.890 --> 18:02.501
They don't wanna grow
up with a dad in prison.

18:02.525 --> 18:04.159
- Put the gun down.
- Please.

18:04.193 --> 18:06.161
- Put the gun down.
- Don't make us do it.

18:06.195 --> 18:08.964
They took my boy.

18:11.567 --> 18:13.401
No, they're the criminals.
They've got my kid.

18:13.436 --> 18:14.713
- We need to talk.
- Wait, you're the mother?

18:14.737 --> 18:16.137
No, I'm the police.

18:16.172 --> 18:17.416
- I just want my son.
- Calm down.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.441
Calm down. It's over.

18:28.792 --> 18:30.826
What's worse, people taking the kids,

18:30.860 --> 18:32.638
or the ones giving them
away in the first place?

18:32.662 --> 18:34.229
People taking them, no doubt.

18:34.264 --> 18:35.464
I just got a text from Jordan.

18:35.498 --> 18:37.099
- I should go.
- What is it?

18:37.133 --> 18:38.344
I don't know. Some kind of problem

18:38.368 --> 18:39.768
with Vinessa. It's okay.

18:39.803 --> 18:41.603
- What kind of problem?
- He didn't say.

18:41.638 --> 18:43.772
- I just gotta go.
- Well, I'm coming with you.

18:52.816 --> 18:54.416
Hey, hey, what's going on?

18:54.451 --> 18:55.918
- Some guys attacked her.
- What?

18:55.952 --> 18:57.329
I came home and I found her like this.

18:57.353 --> 18:59.121
Hey, hey, Vinessa.

18:59.155 --> 19:01.690
Are you okay? You okay, baby girl?

19:01.725 --> 19:03.625
Talk to me? What happened?

19:03.660 --> 19:06.161
What happened?

19:06.196 --> 19:10.599
They pulled me into an alley.

19:10.633 --> 19:11.967
Said they were gonna rape me

19:12.001 --> 19:14.269
'cause "Your brother's a snitch."

19:14.304 --> 19:18.540
What? Okay, what happened after that?

19:18.575 --> 19:22.211
Tell me exactly what happened, Vinessa.

19:22.245 --> 19:24.046
Then...

19:24.080 --> 19:28.450
A truck came down the alley,
so they, um, they ran away.

19:28.485 --> 19:31.720
Vinessa...

19:31.755 --> 19:36.225
These guys, did they
hurt you in any way?

19:36.259 --> 19:38.327
- No.
- Who were they?

19:38.361 --> 19:41.330
You remember who they were?

19:41.364 --> 19:44.800
I... I don't know. Just, um,

19:44.834 --> 19:46.668
some kids from the neighborhood.

19:46.703 --> 19:48.704
Stop lying, Vinessa. Just
tell us who the guys are.

19:48.738 --> 19:50.506
- Jordan...
- She knows ev...

19:50.540 --> 19:51.717
Jordan, I'm gonna take
care of this, okay?

19:51.741 --> 19:53.842
Just go upstairs and calm down.

19:56.946 --> 20:00.682
I got it. Hey, hey.

20:00.717 --> 20:04.987
I'm so sorry. We gonna figure this out.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.193
Figured Vinessa could
use some hot chocolate.

20:11.227 --> 20:14.429
How the hell did those
kids find out about Jordan?

20:14.464 --> 20:16.698
All he did was pick a photo and testify

20:16.733 --> 20:18.277
- in front of a grand jury.
- I don't know.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.369
How did that happen, Kim?

20:20.403 --> 20:23.705
I mean, it doesn't make
no damn sense to me.

20:23.740 --> 20:27.176
I just don't get it. And
now I gotta deal with it.

20:27.210 --> 20:29.344
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

20:29.379 --> 20:31.446
Kevin.

20:35.084 --> 20:40.022
I got a auntie in Texas
who said I should probably

20:40.056 --> 20:41.924
send the kids down
there to live with her.

20:41.958 --> 20:45.627
- What do you think?
- I think those kids need me.

20:45.662 --> 20:47.563
That's what I think.

20:47.597 --> 20:48.931
More than anything, I need them.

20:48.965 --> 20:50.632
So what the hell am I supposed to do?

20:50.667 --> 20:52.044
- Rehome them?
- No, don't even go there.

20:52.068 --> 20:53.468
Kevin, it's completely different.

20:53.503 --> 20:54.970
How? How's it different?

20:55.004 --> 20:56.782
- It... It's just different.
- It doesn't seem

20:56.806 --> 21:00.409
different to me right
now, Kim. Not right now.

21:10.653 --> 21:12.087
You've got this all wrong.

21:12.121 --> 21:14.957
We picked up that boy to rescue him.

21:14.991 --> 21:16.458
Rescue him.

21:16.492 --> 21:18.594
We're working for an
undercover ICE agent.

21:18.628 --> 21:19.995
Clyde Harris.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.897
He's investigating human trafficking,

21:21.931 --> 21:25.133
especially parents giving
away adopted children.

21:27.303 --> 21:30.839
Okay, so, you picked up
Quan, and you gave him

21:30.874 --> 21:32.774
to this ICE agent, Clyde Harris.

21:32.809 --> 21:35.213
- Right.
- But he ended up in a storm shelter.

21:35.577 --> 21:38.947
With two other kids who are both dead.

21:38.982 --> 21:40.849
We met Clyde Harris
a couple of months ago

21:40.884 --> 21:42.784
at a Right to Life rally downtown.

21:42.819 --> 21:45.487
We got to talking, and he said,

21:45.521 --> 21:46.989
"Do you wanna save kids

21:47.023 --> 21:49.291
and maybe make a little extra cash?"

21:49.325 --> 21:50.959
And we said, "Yes."

21:50.994 --> 21:52.995
Save kids, or make extra cash?

21:53.029 --> 21:56.999
Save kids, of course.

21:57.033 --> 21:58.934
Okay, all right. I won't lie.

21:58.968 --> 22:01.203
The extra money helps.

22:01.237 --> 22:04.039
I'm on disability, and
my wife's a realtor.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.808
And, you know, business isn't great.

22:06.843 --> 22:08.510
How much was he giving you?

22:11.080 --> 22:15.550
- $500 a kid.
- $500 a kid?

22:15.585 --> 22:19.688
That's a hell of a payday
for a few hours of work.

22:19.722 --> 22:22.057
We had no reason to doubt Clyde.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.892
Ever.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.994
Okay, explain to me how this works.

22:26.029 --> 22:27.696
When Agent Harris needs your help,

22:27.730 --> 22:29.708
- how does he contact you?
- He calls my cell phone.

22:29.732 --> 22:31.500
And it's always from a different number.

22:31.534 --> 22:34.670
He tells us who we're supposed
to meet, when, and where.

22:34.704 --> 22:36.538
You pretend to be an infertile couple

22:36.572 --> 22:39.308
who wants to adopt. The Marsdens.

22:39.342 --> 22:42.477
People give us their
kids. No questions asked.

22:42.512 --> 22:45.080
I mean, most of the time, anyway.

22:45.114 --> 22:47.015
And then what? Where
do you take the kids?

22:47.050 --> 22:51.853
Um, we... we meet Agent
Harris out at a truck stop

22:51.888 --> 22:53.889
- near I94.
- Okay.

22:53.923 --> 22:55.657
Let's try and call Agent Harris.

22:55.692 --> 22:57.592
Maybe we can meet him
at that truck stop.

22:57.627 --> 23:00.395
- What's your pass code?
- 9934.

23:00.430 --> 23:04.485
9934. Which number is for Agent Harris?

23:04.500 --> 23:06.500
It's the second one, but
it changes all the time.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.770
He has to use burner phones
for his job, you know?

23:08.805 --> 23:11.072
- Right.
- You called Clyde this afternoon?

23:11.086 --> 23:13.108
Just to tell him that we
didn't pick up the child.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.743
It's disconnected.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.219
So how'd he find that trailer?

23:24.253 --> 23:26.421
Penny Marsden left behind
a Bright Morning Realty pen

23:26.456 --> 23:28.457
when she signed the
power of attorney form.

23:28.491 --> 23:29.735
He looked up Bright Morning Realty,

23:29.759 --> 23:31.259
saw Penny's picture.

23:31.294 --> 23:33.028
That office address
was that of the trailer.

23:33.062 --> 23:35.063
You're sure he's not involved?

23:35.098 --> 23:37.733
I'm pretty freaking positive.
Boss, the way that this guy reacted

23:37.767 --> 23:39.201
when we first talked to him?

23:39.235 --> 23:40.769
On top of that, I dumped his phone.

23:40.803 --> 23:41.981
There's no connection to the Marsdens.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.538
No calls, no texts.

23:43.573 --> 23:45.707
His business trip checks out.

23:45.742 --> 23:48.477
I think that, ditching the kid,

23:48.511 --> 23:50.780
it's on his wife, Kate.

23:51.614 --> 23:54.383
- Give me a minute.
- Yes, sir.

23:54.417 --> 23:55.617
Listen.

23:56.919 --> 24:01.656
Home invasion, attempted murder,

24:01.691 --> 24:05.127
is serious time, my friend.

24:05.161 --> 24:06.795
Serious time.

24:08.297 --> 24:09.698
Come on.

24:10.767 --> 24:12.144
Why'd you really go see the Marsdens?

24:12.168 --> 24:13.445
I mean, they holding out on you?

24:13.469 --> 24:15.003
They owe you money?

24:15.038 --> 24:19.107
You think I'm involved in
that sick, twisted world?

24:19.142 --> 24:21.643
- I'm asking...
- I'm telling.

24:21.677 --> 24:23.211
No.

24:25.715 --> 24:28.617
That couple took my son.

24:28.651 --> 24:31.653
And they stuck him in a storm shelter.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.989
And they left him there to die.

24:35.825 --> 24:38.160
What would you do if it was your son?

24:43.199 --> 24:44.366
Okay.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.134
If there was ever any doubt,

24:46.169 --> 24:48.937
just got confirmation from ICE.
There is no Agent Clyde Harris.

24:48.971 --> 24:51.006
There is no undercover
investigation into parents

24:51.040 --> 24:52.707
giving away adopted children.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.443
So either the Marsdens are lying,

24:54.477 --> 24:55.954
or some monster going by Clyde Harris

24:55.978 --> 24:57.646
is playing them real hard.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.381
I think it's choice number two.

24:59.415 --> 25:01.160
I mean, we know there's a
third person involved, right?

25:01.184 --> 25:03.018
Yeah, that meth dealer, Marshall?

25:03.052 --> 25:04.997
Yeah, he told us the neighbor
he saw with the young kid

25:05.021 --> 25:07.489
was a tall white dude.
Marsden is pretty short.

25:07.523 --> 25:08.990
It matches what Quan said, too.

25:09.025 --> 25:10.859
All right, so Clyde's tall. Fantastic.

25:10.893 --> 25:13.028
Let's track him down.

25:13.062 --> 25:15.130
Why don't we go to
the truck stop at I94?

25:15.164 --> 25:17.199
See if we can pull some video.

25:19.335 --> 25:21.002
Hey, um, I gotta go.

25:21.037 --> 25:22.815
Jordan and Vinessa, they're
not answering the phone

25:22.839 --> 25:24.306
- so...
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

25:24.340 --> 25:25.707
Go, go, go.

25:28.377 --> 25:31.331
Hey, where's Jordan? I've
been calling y'all all day.

25:31.340 --> 25:32.514
Okay, don't get mad at me.

25:32.548 --> 25:34.716
- I tried to stop him, but...
- Stop him from what?

25:34.750 --> 25:36.818
What are you talking about? Is he here?

25:36.853 --> 25:40.021
He went to find the boys who grabbed me.

25:40.056 --> 25:42.557
Vinessa, you told me you
didn't know who they were.

25:42.592 --> 25:44.059
I lied. I knew one of them.

25:44.093 --> 25:45.994
- Deon Barnes.
- Okay, where does he live?

25:46.028 --> 25:47.996
Near 65 and Jefferson.

25:48.030 --> 25:49.564
Jordan said he was gonna kill him.

25:49.599 --> 25:50.999
What? What'd you just say?

25:51.033 --> 25:52.868
He was so mad. I...

25:55.738 --> 25:57.372
Damn.

25:57.406 --> 25:59.875
Vinessa, lock the doors and
don't let anybody in this house.

25:59.909 --> 26:01.309
You hear me?

26:23.389 --> 26:26.358
Jordan, what the hell are you doing?

26:26.392 --> 26:27.525
Jordan!

26:27.560 --> 26:28.693
Jordan, stop!

26:28.728 --> 26:30.595
Jordan.

26:30.630 --> 26:32.264
Jordan!

26:33.966 --> 26:35.600
- Jordan!
- Leave me alone, man!

26:35.635 --> 26:38.970
Give me the gun. Give me the gun.

26:39.005 --> 26:40.582
What the hell is wrong with you, Jordan?

26:40.606 --> 26:42.807
What were you gonna do?
You were gonna kill them.

26:42.842 --> 26:44.753
You was gonna kill them?
Well, if I'd have rolled up

26:44.777 --> 26:46.388
a minute later, your
ass would have been dead.

26:46.412 --> 26:48.713
- I... I couldn't...
- I know you couldn't.

26:48.748 --> 26:50.215
And you know why you couldn't?

26:50.249 --> 26:52.150
Because you're not that person, Jordan.

26:52.184 --> 26:54.052
Okay? That's not you.

26:54.086 --> 26:55.487
Damn, I'm mad. I get it.

26:55.521 --> 26:57.289
- You're mad, too.
- No, you don't get it.

26:57.323 --> 26:58.767
What do you mean? You
think I don't wanna

26:58.791 --> 27:00.759
- whoop they ass?
- This is your fault.

27:00.793 --> 27:03.728
You made me do this. You...
you made me testify...

27:03.763 --> 27:05.597
Don't blame it on me,
man. It's not like that.

27:05.631 --> 27:07.666
- Why did you make me do it?
- Because we sat down

27:07.700 --> 27:09.301
and we decided this was the right thing.

27:09.335 --> 27:11.002
You decided!

27:11.037 --> 27:13.471
You! Not me!

27:15.007 --> 27:18.443
I don't give a damn
about being a role model.

27:18.477 --> 27:20.078
I ain't ask for this.

27:20.112 --> 27:21.813
Vinessa, she ain't ask for this.

27:21.847 --> 27:23.682
Don't you get that?

27:30.156 --> 27:33.458
Damn. Jordan.

27:35.728 --> 27:37.729
Jordan, look at me, bro.

27:40.132 --> 27:43.034
I didn't mean for that to happen.

27:43.069 --> 27:46.838
I'm only doing my best to protect y'all.

27:46.872 --> 27:49.307
To be there for y'all.

27:52.211 --> 27:54.746
I got it wrong this time.

27:57.917 --> 27:59.484
I'm sorry.

28:01.821 --> 28:04.489
I just got it wrong
this time, that's all.

28:08.194 --> 28:09.861
All right, so there's the Marsdens

28:09.895 --> 28:12.397
right there with Quan.
That's gotta be Clyde Harris.

28:12.431 --> 28:13.998
Can you get any closer?

28:14.033 --> 28:15.700
Not without sacrificing detail.

28:15.735 --> 28:17.479
You can't see his face
anyway with the ball cap on.

28:17.503 --> 28:19.704
There's no license plate on that RV.

28:22.675 --> 28:25.343
Looks like Clyde's
trying to give Quan food.

28:26.412 --> 28:28.813
Yeah, from BurgerNDash.

28:28.848 --> 28:30.815
Okay, I'm gonna pull video
from nearby locations,

28:30.850 --> 28:32.327
see if we can get a
better look at this guy.

28:32.351 --> 28:33.718
Right on.

28:36.756 --> 28:38.089
Hey, guys.

28:38.124 --> 28:39.758
Got a clear image of Clyde Harris

28:39.792 --> 28:41.693
from a BurgerNDash
near the truck stop.

28:41.727 --> 28:44.229
Facial recognition matches Clyde Dupree.

28:44.263 --> 28:46.197
He's got a prior for ivory smuggling.

28:46.232 --> 28:48.166
Ivory smuggling? Is that a joke?

28:48.200 --> 28:50.335
No, he paid a $10,000 fine.

28:50.369 --> 28:51.936
He did two months probation.

28:51.971 --> 28:53.872
His new business model's
pretty much the same.

28:53.906 --> 28:55.173
He just changed the cargo.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.054
- Give us a sec to get around.
- Yeah.

29:20.633 --> 29:23.101
- Chicago PD.
- Hit it.

29:27.106 --> 29:29.307
He went out the back.

29:32.611 --> 29:33.878
Stop!

29:33.913 --> 29:35.713
Freeze!

29:39.952 --> 29:43.555
- Where's Clyde Dupree?
- I don't know who that is.

29:43.589 --> 29:44.989
You were just in his apartment.

29:45.024 --> 29:46.791
He moved out this morning.

29:46.826 --> 29:48.893
I thought I could take
what he left behind.

29:48.928 --> 29:52.897
I panhandle outside.
I saw the guy pack up

29:52.932 --> 29:54.332
and leave in a hurry.

29:54.366 --> 29:56.000
He threw that in the hall dumpster.

29:56.035 --> 29:58.837
I thought I could
find something to sell.

29:58.871 --> 30:02.273
Looks like papers for
something called Sanctuary Row.

30:04.710 --> 30:06.578
How did Clyde know we were on to him?

30:06.612 --> 30:07.823
He's cautious. Read the papers.

30:07.847 --> 30:09.247
Thinks three of his kids are dead.

30:09.281 --> 30:10.748
Knows the police are all over it.

30:10.783 --> 30:13.418
Guys, I found something. Sanctuary Row.

30:13.452 --> 30:14.986
This dark net stuff is pretty rough.

30:15.020 --> 30:16.421
I feel like I need a shower.

30:16.455 --> 30:18.990
Exotic animals. Royal
Stripe Ball Python.

30:19.024 --> 30:20.458
Female, ten years old.

30:20.493 --> 30:22.694
Pale coloring, well behaved. Very rare.

30:22.728 --> 30:25.163
He's talking about the kids.

30:25.197 --> 30:28.132
Yeah, he's got four animals listed.

30:28.167 --> 30:29.501
He's selling four kids.

30:29.535 --> 30:31.436
Click on this old link.

30:31.470 --> 30:33.304
How many kids has he auctioned off?

30:36.509 --> 30:39.944
- 18.
- This guy's sick.

30:39.979 --> 30:42.614
He sets up a rehoming site
so he can find his product,

30:42.648 --> 30:44.449
and then he auctions
them off on the dark net.

30:44.483 --> 30:46.651
Says here the auction
closes in 19 minutes.

30:46.685 --> 30:49.454
Winners will be notified of a
pickup location at that time.

30:49.488 --> 30:52.023
Start bidding.

30:52.057 --> 30:53.625
How are we gonna pay for it?

30:53.659 --> 30:55.560
It's gonna be tough to
get flash money in time.

30:55.594 --> 30:58.596
Just let me worry about
that. You make sure you win.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.533
That wire transfer went okay?

31:09.567 --> 31:11.535
Yeah, I took the money from your locker,

31:11.569 --> 31:15.372
had my C.I. make the actual transfer.

31:15.406 --> 31:19.576
- Fingerprints aren't on it.
- Good.

31:19.610 --> 31:24.114
So, I checked Antonio's phone today.

31:24.148 --> 31:28.018
He got a call a couple
nights ago from Woods.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.453
Lasted three minutes.

31:30.488 --> 31:32.622
- Three minutes?
- Yeah.

31:32.657 --> 31:35.325
So they had something to talk about.

31:39.297 --> 31:41.097
Red pickup truck coming in.

31:41.132 --> 31:42.766
White male driver. Illinois tags.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.768
57 Adam Victor 2 Union.

31:44.802 --> 31:46.069
Copy, I see him.

31:46.103 --> 31:47.637
This should be the last one.

31:47.672 --> 31:51.041
All the auction winners are here now.

31:56.347 --> 31:58.315
All right, plates are registered

31:58.349 --> 32:02.485
to Maryann Richter, 788 Pine Place.

32:07.358 --> 32:09.926
Well, that don't look
like a Maryann to me.

32:09.961 --> 32:12.095
White, male.

32:12.129 --> 32:14.164
- Mid30s.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold up.

32:14.198 --> 32:16.800
I'm getting a, hit
on the pickup's address.

32:16.834 --> 32:19.336
Daniel Richter, 35,
registered sex offender.

32:19.370 --> 32:20.837
Lives with his mother, Maryann.

32:20.871 --> 32:22.672
All right, check your phones, everybody.

32:22.707 --> 32:24.284
I'm gonna send over a photo of this guy.

32:24.308 --> 32:25.842
I'm gonna need a positive.

32:29.847 --> 32:32.415
Hey, honey. Yeah, I'm
positive I'll be late tonight.

32:32.450 --> 32:33.750
- That's a positive.
- Okay.

32:33.784 --> 32:34.985
Love you, too.

32:36.220 --> 32:38.121
We've got a Winnebago.

32:38.155 --> 32:39.356
Yeah, it looks like our guy.

32:39.390 --> 32:41.124
That's him, 100 percent.

32:41.158 --> 32:42.626
- Confirmed.
- All right, Burgess.

32:42.660 --> 32:46.630
Start creeping in
real slow. Upton, same.

32:46.664 --> 32:49.833
Atwater, Antonio, on my command.

33:01.912 --> 33:03.146
Come on.

33:03.180 --> 33:05.148
Come on, come on.

33:07.918 --> 33:10.487
We need him away from that trailer.

33:10.521 --> 33:13.189
Chances are the other three
kids are in there, too.

33:18.195 --> 33:19.796
Move in.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.308
Hey, police! Don't move.

33:31.342 --> 33:33.810
Do not move.

33:33.844 --> 33:35.078
Come on.

33:39.216 --> 33:40.817
Back off, or I'll kill her.

33:40.851 --> 33:42.552
Please, please.

33:42.586 --> 33:44.988
- Back off!
- Please!

33:45.022 --> 33:46.589
Stop walking, or I'll shoot.

33:46.624 --> 33:49.059
I swear to God, I'll shoot.

33:49.093 --> 33:50.393
I'll shoot. I swear to God.

33:56.967 --> 33:59.869
Come with me. It's okay.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.514
Where are the other kids?

34:12.550 --> 34:16.286
- Where are the other kids?
- In the camper.

34:17.755 --> 34:18.955
Where are the other...

34:18.989 --> 34:20.357
All of them.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.125
You've been doing this six months.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.960
I don't remember.

34:24.995 --> 34:26.429
Wrong answer.

34:26.464 --> 34:29.264
You got one last
chance. Only this time...

34:29.300 --> 34:31.534
Hey, hey, hey!

34:31.569 --> 34:33.703
You don't give me the right answer...

34:33.737 --> 34:38.108
- Enough!
- Turn over. Turn over!

34:38.141 --> 34:40.377
I want you to see it coming.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.878
- Hank, enough!
- Hey, Sarge,

34:41.911 --> 34:44.080
if you kill him, we can't get the kids.

34:44.114 --> 34:45.815
Okay?

34:45.850 --> 34:48.985
Okay? Hank.

34:49.018 --> 34:50.820
Come on, get up. Get up!

34:50.855 --> 34:53.123
Get up!

35:05.936 --> 35:07.570
Hey, come on, guys.

35:07.605 --> 35:10.173
Hey, come on out. It's okay.

35:10.207 --> 35:12.108
All right? Don't be scared.

35:12.143 --> 35:14.277
- Okay?
- Don't be scared.

35:14.311 --> 35:16.679
Can you breathe for me?
In and out, just slow.

35:16.714 --> 35:19.449
You guy are safe now. All right?

35:23.454 --> 35:26.656
I want a lawyer. I want a lawyer!

35:34.064 --> 35:35.598
Right now...

35:38.636 --> 35:41.104
Is your one chance to tell me

35:41.138 --> 35:43.306
where the rest of those kids are.

35:45.075 --> 35:48.578
And give me the passwords to
all your twisted web sites.

35:52.516 --> 35:54.517
What's in it for me?

36:00.891 --> 36:02.459
Your ability to live.

36:05.229 --> 36:06.763
Excuse me?

36:15.506 --> 36:17.540
You're gonna be placed
in general population

36:17.575 --> 36:21.077
at Cook County. And, um,

36:21.111 --> 36:23.313
believe me when I tell you...

36:26.283 --> 36:28.918
There's a lot of real bad people there.

36:30.754 --> 36:34.457
But they... they have their own...

36:36.794 --> 36:40.163
code of conduct.

36:40.197 --> 36:43.433
And...

36:43.467 --> 36:47.170
The one thing they really hate...

36:47.204 --> 36:51.574
is people who hurt children.

36:51.609 --> 36:56.513
I mean, they do all
kinds of things to them.

36:58.282 --> 37:02.785
Torture, rape...

37:08.959 --> 37:13.796
You give me what I'm asking for...

37:13.831 --> 37:17.700
I'll make sure you're
placed in special population.

37:19.336 --> 37:21.404
You'll be protected there.

37:23.307 --> 37:27.577
If not, well...

37:59.043 --> 38:01.511
Offer expires in 30 seconds.

38:14.124 --> 38:16.659
You serious about special
population for him?

38:16.694 --> 38:19.529
Hell no. I already called
my friend at Cook County.

38:19.563 --> 38:23.132
Clyde is gonna get what's
coming to him, trust me.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.568
Hey.

38:58.602 --> 39:00.236
Patrol picked up

39:00.270 --> 39:01.704
six of the kids on Clyde's list.

39:01.739 --> 39:03.606
The rest are in the wind.

39:05.376 --> 39:08.044
At least we saved some of them?

39:08.078 --> 39:11.381
It's a good thing we
found that auction in time.

39:11.415 --> 39:13.416
Yeah.

39:13.450 --> 39:15.752
Speaking of which...

39:15.786 --> 39:18.154
how'd you get the money
for the auction so fast?

39:19.523 --> 39:21.124
Why are you so interested?

39:25.763 --> 39:27.363
So you can tell Woods?

39:27.398 --> 39:29.832
Excuse me?

39:29.867 --> 39:31.701
You've been talking to him, haven't you?

39:31.735 --> 39:34.270
Some State's Attorney named Potter.

39:38.142 --> 39:41.044
You spied on me?

39:41.078 --> 39:42.512
That a yes?

39:46.083 --> 39:48.751
Potter's working the Lopez homicide.

39:48.786 --> 39:50.620
You remember that, don't you?

39:50.654 --> 39:52.588
- Yeah.
- Potter had a few questions

39:52.623 --> 39:55.558
about the case, since
Lopez wound up dead

39:55.592 --> 39:57.427
after we released him.

40:01.331 --> 40:04.133
Was Woods there?

40:04.168 --> 40:07.303
Yeah.

40:07.337 --> 40:09.472
They think I'm involved?

40:09.506 --> 40:11.574
They do.

40:11.608 --> 40:13.609
What'd you say?

40:13.644 --> 40:18.915
Not a damn thing.

40:18.949 --> 40:22.151
You and I might disagree
on certain things,

40:22.186 --> 40:24.954
but I don't do business like that.

40:27.691 --> 40:29.659
Never have.

40:39.369 --> 40:41.804
What's up, Sarge?

40:41.839 --> 40:43.940
- Checking in.
- Yeah, everything okay?

40:43.974 --> 40:46.576
Yeah, thanks. How you doing?

40:46.610 --> 40:47.844
I'm all right. Take a seat.

40:47.878 --> 40:51.013
Thanks. Want a beer?

40:51.048 --> 40:55.017
- Don't mind if I do.
- Yeah.

40:55.052 --> 40:58.187
- It's been a hell of a day.
- Right?

40:58.222 --> 40:59.322
To a hell of a day.

41:00.657 --> 41:01.924
Yeah.

41:03.694 --> 41:06.062
Quiet around here. Where are the kids?

41:08.398 --> 41:10.333
On the plane to Texas.

41:11.702 --> 41:14.670
- Texas?
- Yeah, believe it or not.

41:15.973 --> 41:17.940
I mean, at the end of the day, Sarge,

41:17.975 --> 41:21.778
I won't forgive myself if anything
really happened to those kids.

41:23.313 --> 41:26.282
So I made the best decision.

41:26.316 --> 41:28.551
For them, anyway.

41:28.585 --> 41:30.653
For the family.

41:30.687 --> 41:32.488
Yeah.

41:34.758 --> 41:36.759
I understand.

41:40.264 --> 41:41.831
I understand.
