WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:04.305
Wade Kinsella and Lemon Breeland
owning a business together?

00:04.338 --> 00:06.374
Who cares that everybody
thinks we're gonna crash
and burn, right?

00:06.407 --> 00:08.642
Us working together
was obviously a mistake.

00:08.676 --> 00:11.745
You have been blowing me off
for a week. I've barely
seen you since the hospital.

00:11.779 --> 00:14.115
What's going on with you two?
There's just something
I have to tell her,

00:14.148 --> 00:16.350
and I don't know
 how she's gonna take it.
I love you.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.718
There is nothing
that I can't take.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.587
George has moved on.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.754
So what if he's amazing?

00:20.788 --> 00:22.323
I won't let myself like him.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.126
Why don't you just come live
with me on my houseboat?

00:25.159 --> 00:27.095
I would love that.
ZOE:
 You guys are living together.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.796
Big congrats.

00:34.435 --> 00:38.272
DASH (on computer):
BlueBell's most unlikely
twosome, George Tucker

00:38.306 --> 00:41.142
and Tansy Truitt,
seem to be playing house.

00:41.175 --> 00:45.079
Or should I say
playing houseboat?

00:45.113 --> 00:47.081
Your fearless Blawker

00:47.115 --> 00:49.483
caught them moving her stuff
into his vessel

00:49.517 --> 00:52.153
as they set sail on the sea
of cohabitation.

00:52.186 --> 00:55.523
Bon voyage.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.427
(gagging)

01:06.667 --> 01:10.204
(grunting)

01:10.238 --> 01:13.073
(gags)

01:18.512 --> 01:19.847
(coughing)

01:20.881 --> 01:23.584
(gasping)

01:23.617 --> 01:27.821
LAVON:
Okay, a... five-letter word
for calling in sick.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.823
Starts with a "H."

01:29.857 --> 01:31.459
Mmm, "hooky."

01:31.492 --> 01:32.893
As in "playing hooky."

01:32.926 --> 01:36.230
Yep. Uh, th-that's
a sign right there.

01:36.264 --> 01:39.333
Even the-the crossword puzzle's
telling us to stay in today.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.735
It does not say that.
Let me see.
No,

01:41.769 --> 01:43.137
wait, I didn't
fill it in yet.

01:43.171 --> 01:46.140
Hold on.
In case anyone is interested,

01:46.174 --> 01:48.142
I just almost died.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.277
You ran out
of conditioner again?

01:49.310 --> 01:50.678
I keep telling you,
buy it in bulk.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.480
ANNABETH:
Lavon.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.615
Seriously, you okay?

01:54.648 --> 01:58.152
I almost choked on a donut bite.
I couldn't breathe.

01:58.186 --> 02:00.454
That happened to Lavon the other
day-- he choked on a walnut,

02:00.488 --> 02:02.490
and I had to give him
a little pat on the back.

02:02.523 --> 02:03.491
Yeah.
Exactly.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.426
You were here to give him
a pat on the back.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.428
I had to Heimlich myself.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.628
I ju... I just

02:08.662 --> 02:10.731
saw my future, and if
an asteroid landed

02:10.764 --> 02:11.732
on us right now,

02:11.765 --> 02:14.735
I would be the only one
in this house to...

02:14.768 --> 02:15.936
to die alone.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.806
The odds of that
happening are teeny-tiny.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.242
Yeah, it's true--
I saw a special about NASA.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.843
They got satellites
up there looking.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.545
That is not the point.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.914
I almost choked on a donut bite

02:26.947 --> 02:28.616
by myself.

02:30.418 --> 02:33.754
I hereby call to order the
owners' breakfast meeting.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.290
Uh, excuse me, Wade, Lemon?

02:36.324 --> 02:37.625
Before you start your meeting,

02:37.658 --> 02:39.227
Shanetta and I were wondering

02:39.260 --> 02:41.829
is this owners' meeting gonna be
like the others

02:41.862 --> 02:43.531
in that there will be...

02:43.564 --> 02:44.565
Is there gonna
be yelling?

02:44.598 --> 02:47.201
You two chuckleheads
caterwauling at each other

02:47.235 --> 02:48.636
is giving Wanda anxiety.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.238
Rest assured, there will be

02:50.271 --> 02:52.973
no caterwauling today.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.608
LEMON:
That is right.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.244
Today's meeting is celebratory.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.678
As the new owners
of the Rammer Jammer,

02:57.711 --> 02:59.413
we have turned our first profit.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.315
(whoops)
Good news.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.616
Well, enjoy your meeting.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.752
Hmm. All right, jumping
into new business.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.320
Yes.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.556
I'm happy to announce that
I've taken the initiative

03:08.589 --> 03:10.524
to reinvest the Rammer
Jammer's profits

03:10.558 --> 03:11.859
in...
I'm sorry, you what?

03:11.892 --> 03:13.026
Drumroll, please.

03:13.060 --> 03:16.264
A bran-new flat-screen TV
for that corner over there.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.598
You are welcome.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.700
Why the hell would you do that?
Well,

03:19.733 --> 03:21.735
since the days of the caveman,

03:21.769 --> 03:23.804
live sporting events have
drawn paying customers

03:23.837 --> 03:25.739
to local watering holes
such as this one.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.575
Yes, the operative word
being "cavemen."

03:27.608 --> 03:29.410
We are turning
the Rammer Jammer

03:29.443 --> 03:31.412
into the sports bar
of our dreams, Lemon.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.680
(laughing):
How great is that?

03:32.713 --> 03:34.448
Try not great at all.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.016
It just so happens
that I invested

03:36.049 --> 03:37.017
that very same profit

03:37.050 --> 03:40.454
into an antique parlor set
for the new salon area

03:40.488 --> 03:41.955
of the Rammer Jammer.

03:41.989 --> 03:45.459
We... we don't have
a salon area, Lemon.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.860
That is why I bought
a parlor set,

03:46.894 --> 03:48.862
Wade.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.998
WADE:
You bought that?

03:51.031 --> 03:53.267
As in we are now
the proud owners

03:53.301 --> 03:54.735
of the world's most
uncomfortable couch?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.770
(gasps) That is a settee.

03:56.804 --> 03:57.771
Well, in that case.

03:57.805 --> 03:58.872
And it is the first step towards

03:58.906 --> 04:00.341
elevating the Rammer Jammer

04:00.374 --> 04:02.576
to a destination spot
for Belles

04:02.610 --> 04:04.011
and book clubs

04:04.044 --> 04:06.347
and wine tasting groups
and knitting cabals.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.049
That is the worst idea

04:09.082 --> 04:10.751
I have ever heard.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.553
I can't believe you'd
spend our money

04:12.586 --> 04:14.588
on some crap like that
without telling me first.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.324
How can you not believe it
when you went ahead

04:16.357 --> 04:17.458
and did the exact same thing?

04:17.491 --> 04:19.493
(pop)

04:24.732 --> 04:26.767
Brick, hello?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.870
You would not believe what...

04:29.903 --> 04:32.373
We could run
some blood if...
Yeah, but
what's the point?

04:32.406 --> 04:34.074
Are you kidding--
what is he doing here?

04:34.107 --> 04:35.576
Dr. Hart, did you
not see that note?

04:35.609 --> 04:36.777
Yeah, "Do not disturb"?

04:36.810 --> 04:37.578
What am I, housekeeping?

04:37.611 --> 04:41.349
You remember
my nephew Jonah?
Jonah

04:41.382 --> 04:42.783
who's supposed
to be in New York?

04:42.816 --> 04:44.985
Brick, how about I take
the file and peruse it

04:45.018 --> 04:46.787
at the bakery over a sweet tea?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.322
I'll let you two catch up.
Yeah.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.657
What file? Is that
one of my patients?

04:49.690 --> 04:50.724
Always a pleasure, Zoe.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.662
I cannot believe that you are
behind closed doors

04:54.695 --> 04:56.797
discussing our patients
with Jonah.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.800
As senior partner at this
practice, it is my prerogative

04:59.833 --> 05:00.934
to consult
with other physicians.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.903
You have a physician right here.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.037
In house.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.606
I cannot believe
you are still

05:05.639 --> 05:07.007
trying to muscle me out
of this practice.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.676
No one is trying to...

05:08.709 --> 05:10.944
I almost died this morning.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.680
Choking on a donut.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.515
And then I realized

05:14.548 --> 05:17.551
I am totally alone and all
I have in life is my work

05:17.585 --> 05:19.753
and you're trying to take
that away now, too?

05:19.787 --> 05:21.555
Knock, knock,
am I interrupting?
Yes!

05:21.589 --> 05:22.890
Not at all.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.392
I am desperate need of a doctor.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.560
I'm having a medical
emergency in my tummy

05:26.594 --> 05:28.562
and I need an immediate
transfusion of lunch.

05:28.596 --> 05:29.730
Adorable.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.567
You mind if I handle
this one, Doctor?

05:33.601 --> 05:34.902
We are not through here.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.406
We are not through here.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.548
And I'm back.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.983
I got some of that
all-natural cereal you like

05:50.017 --> 05:52.986
with the nuts
and the grains and the...

05:53.020 --> 05:55.823
little bits of rope
in it-- I...

05:55.856 --> 05:58.726
just got to find a
place to put it down.
Um,

05:58.759 --> 06:01.595
sorry, my stuff seems
to be multiplying.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.497
I tried to confine it
to one corner, but...

06:03.531 --> 06:04.798
Listen, Tans...

06:04.832 --> 06:05.966
So, we can't get to
the steering wheel.

06:05.999 --> 06:09.036
So what? We just won't go
anywhere for a while, okay?

06:09.069 --> 06:11.472
It's just temporary until
Tom and Wanda's bees are

06:11.505 --> 06:12.606
out of my trailer.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.808
I know, I know, and, baby?

06:14.842 --> 06:17.745
Listen, you can stay
as long as you like.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.881
It's not awful
having me live here?

06:20.914 --> 06:22.049
It doesn't scare you?

06:22.082 --> 06:24.518
No, nothing scares me.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.655
(George yells)
(Tansy shrieks)

06:27.688 --> 06:30.624
TANSY:
I don't believe it!

06:30.658 --> 06:31.925
Give me a hug.
I don't believe it.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.494
(laughing, clamoring)

06:33.527 --> 06:35.763
(whoops)

06:35.796 --> 06:36.964
Hey, so y'all know each other.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.699
What are you guys doing here?

06:38.732 --> 06:39.900
We heard you moved in
with your new beau,

06:39.933 --> 06:42.636
and we figured it was fate
telling us we ought to meet him.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.104
George, meet my brothers--
Rudy, Rocket

06:44.137 --> 06:46.940
and the scruffy
one's Chicken.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.777
Oh, uh, well, it is a...

06:49.810 --> 06:52.713
Oh, come on over here.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.981
Okay, we are doing this.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.649
(laughs)

06:55.683 --> 06:56.917
Hey, don't you worry, bro.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.051
You'll barely
know we're here.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.454
What?
Where you want
to put our stuff?

07:01.955 --> 07:03.724
Come here,
you prickly porcupine.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.759
Fancy Tansy.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.066
Oh, didn't think
you'd still be here.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.668
What, you think I'm gonna
storm out of here in a huff

07:14.702 --> 07:17.070
just because Brick would
rather fly you in than consult

07:17.104 --> 07:19.072
with his partner, who
singlehandedly has kept

07:19.106 --> 07:21.174
this office going the
past couple weeks?

07:21.208 --> 07:23.210
Okay, good, so we, uh,
we cleared that up.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.145
I'm just gonna return
this to Brick's.
Ooh...

07:25.178 --> 07:27.648
Uh, what patient is it that
Brick doesn't trust me with?

07:27.681 --> 07:30.551
I wouldn't know.
Your holding the patient's file.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.085
Well, doctor/patient
confidentiality, so...

07:32.119 --> 07:33.153
Well...

07:33.186 --> 07:34.555
the odd's are I am probably

07:34.588 --> 07:36.590
that patient's doctor,
so who is it?

07:36.624 --> 07:37.691
Trust me, you're not gonna
want to see this.

07:37.725 --> 07:38.592
You're gonna feel
like a jackass.

07:38.626 --> 07:39.827
Just hand it...
Will you hand it over?

07:39.860 --> 07:41.261
I'm telling you,
you're gonna feel...

07:41.294 --> 07:44.197
(grunts)
Ow, come...

07:44.231 --> 07:45.899
(groans) What were you--
Israeli army?

07:45.933 --> 07:48.068
What the hell?

07:48.101 --> 07:50.137
Brick?

07:50.170 --> 07:51.204
Brick has

07:51.238 --> 07:52.706
a pituitary tumor?

07:52.740 --> 07:54.542
He had an MRI a
couple weeks ago.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.776
He said it was negative.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.978
He told everybody
he was fine.
He lied.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.780
He's going in
for surgery tomorrow.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.015
Well, you were right.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.051
I do feel like a jackass.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.894
(car horn honks)

08:13.927 --> 08:17.197
(seagulls calling)

08:17.230 --> 08:19.232
(birds singing)

08:21.769 --> 08:22.870
Zoe, really, it's okay.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.104
No, it's not.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.873
I was not my best
self yesterday.

08:25.906 --> 08:26.874
Where was I?

08:26.907 --> 08:28.776
Uh, you were terribly
sorry you blew up at me

08:28.809 --> 08:31.144
and you managed to make
my illness all about you.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.679
Right.

08:32.712 --> 08:33.914
Okay, I guess I was done.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.015
Jonah says that it's
a non-secreting growth.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.017
Yes.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.653
I got the good tumor, lucky me.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.154
The only thing
I have to worry about is

08:41.188 --> 08:44.291
that my surgeon has a steady
hand and I don't go blind.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.860
Right, but why
didn't you tell me?

08:46.894 --> 08:48.862
Because you are what
we here in the southern states

08:48.896 --> 08:51.799
refer to as a "blabbermouth."

08:51.832 --> 08:53.801
Fair enough.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.669
But you didn't tell Lemon
or Magnolia either.

08:55.703 --> 08:56.804
Oh, the girls have enough
to worry about.

08:56.837 --> 09:00.140
Well, this is huge and you need
your family around you.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.176
I'm fine-- I've got Jonah
and I've got Shelby.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.678
Oh, yeah, right-- Shelby?

09:05.713 --> 09:07.080
Oh, you're serious.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.249
Look, Shelby just doesn't
really strike me as the...

09:09.282 --> 09:11.585
The caregiver type-- I know.

09:11.619 --> 09:15.022
But from the second I told her,
Shelby, she's been amazing.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.725
I mean, she's been
so supportive and...

09:17.758 --> 09:20.994
Oh, a true, true partner.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.365
Dr. Hart?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.234
Are you okay?

09:29.837 --> 09:31.739
(crying): It's just so important

09:31.772 --> 09:33.941
to have a true partner in life.

09:33.974 --> 09:37.344
You know, it's just... it's
something that I realized

09:37.377 --> 09:40.147
yesterday having almost died,
choking on a donut.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.249
Uh-huh.

09:45.252 --> 09:48.121
You know I would love to stay
here and hear all about this,

09:48.155 --> 09:51.625
but your tears are making me
profoundly uncomfortable.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.193
Mm-hmm.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.296
(snoring)

09:59.066 --> 10:01.034
(grunts)

10:01.068 --> 10:02.169
Hey.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.071
Hey.
What are you doing?

10:04.104 --> 10:06.807
Oh, nothing, just putting
away some of your stuff.

10:06.840 --> 10:07.808
Okay.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.077
Um... why?

10:10.110 --> 10:13.714
You got a lot of nice things,
breakables, valuables.

10:13.747 --> 10:16.249
Uh, don't want my brothers
doing anything to them.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.285
Now, what do you imagine
that they would do

10:18.318 --> 10:21.254
to my decorative minor league
baseball team shot glass?

10:21.288 --> 10:23.957
I don't know--
maybe put something in it

10:23.991 --> 10:24.958
you don't want in it.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.727
Oh...

10:26.760 --> 10:29.396
I love my brothers to death,

10:29.429 --> 10:31.198
but chaos follows them.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.767
You got a look at them
like overgrown kids

10:33.801 --> 10:37.137
without reason, common sense
or commitment to hygiene.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.906
Big infants really.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.109
(men grunting)

10:43.777 --> 10:47.114
Dude, we slept on a boat.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.850
Hey, you should go up on
deck to see where we are.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.118
Don't, he's gonna
push you over.

10:51.151 --> 10:55.022
(groans)
I can't believe
I almost fell for that.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.023
So where are we?

10:56.056 --> 10:58.358
Uh, we're docked.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.694
So we... we didn't move.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.763
Seems to me to be
a missed opportunity.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.031
Hey, uh, Tans?

11:04.064 --> 11:05.398
You gonna take us to
lunch later, or what?

11:05.432 --> 11:07.768
I wish I could,
but I've got

11:07.801 --> 11:09.369
appointments
all day, and...

11:09.402 --> 11:12.039
I'm sure George
has to be in court.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.141
Oh, no. No, actually,
Judge Perkins is sick,

11:14.174 --> 11:15.876
so I-I mean, I could take
y'all to lunch.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.277
Solid.
Hey, hey...

11:17.310 --> 11:18.445
Chicken! Wake up!

11:18.478 --> 11:19.947
Wake up!

11:19.980 --> 11:21.248
Buenas noches.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.449
We're gonna
have lunch

11:22.482 --> 11:24.184
with a lawyer
today.
(laughs)

11:24.217 --> 11:25.452
Whoa.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.054
Did we sleep on a boat?

11:27.087 --> 11:28.455
Yes, we did.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.258
Hey, um, you should
go up on deck

11:31.291 --> 11:33.861
and go see
where we are.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.295
CHICKEN:
Where?

11:35.328 --> 11:36.964
That's a good idea.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.467
I was giving you an out.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.102
I know.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.336
But they're your family.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.039
And I feel like I should...

11:46.073 --> 11:47.307
try to get to know 'em.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.076
All right.
Well...

11:49.109 --> 11:50.410
maybe it'll
be good

11:50.443 --> 11:52.946
for them to have
you around, too.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.082
You'll keep 'em
out of trouble?

11:55.115 --> 11:57.350
I promise.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.452
CHICKEN:
Whoa, whoa!

11:59.486 --> 12:01.388
(water splashes)

12:07.560 --> 12:08.862
SHELBY: Oh, hi,
Dr. Hart.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.431
Shelby!

12:11.464 --> 12:13.500
Oh... okay.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.902
How you doing
with everything?

12:14.935 --> 12:16.870
Brick told you about
the procedure.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.471
Yeah.
He did.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.007
Listen, if you
need anything,

12:20.040 --> 12:21.241
I want you
to call me.

12:21.274 --> 12:24.011
Brick is so lucky to
have someone like you

12:24.044 --> 12:25.913
in his life right now.
Did you know that?

12:25.946 --> 12:27.414
Sure.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.882
As recent experience
has taught me,

12:28.916 --> 12:30.517
there is nothing worse

12:30.550 --> 12:33.153
than the fear
of facing death alone.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.288
Death?

12:35.322 --> 12:36.824
Nobody's facing death.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.892
Brick said that this
is a relatively common surgery.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.427
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, yeah.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.862
It's common. And safe.

12:41.895 --> 12:42.729
I didn't mean
death like...

12:42.762 --> 12:44.531
death death,
you know, just...

12:44.564 --> 12:46.299
when someone goes
under the knife,

12:46.333 --> 12:48.201
you want to prepare for
any complications.

12:48.235 --> 12:49.970
And the best way to prepare

12:50.003 --> 12:52.005
is having a loved one, like you,

12:52.039 --> 12:53.173
by your side.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.177
You're a rock star.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.480
Thank you? Uh...

13:00.513 --> 13:02.816
CRICKETT:
It has come to my attention

13:02.850 --> 13:05.986
that calendar protocol is
not always being followed.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.254
Henrietta,

13:07.287 --> 13:08.421
you might want
to take some notes.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.057
I thought that
I was done

13:10.090 --> 13:11.458
being surprised
by Wade,

13:11.491 --> 13:13.593
but the man has
no vision. None.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.962
Shh.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.263
Crickett's talking
calendar protocol.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.531
(scoffs)
I did not
just say that.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.467
Okay. What happened
this time?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.169
Okay, you know that
antique parlor set

13:22.202 --> 13:23.470
that you helped
me pick out?
Mm-hmm.

13:23.503 --> 13:24.972
He said that I
have to return it

13:25.005 --> 13:26.239
because I didn't
run it by him first.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.475
Like you're married,
or something?

13:28.508 --> 13:30.978
Right?
Hmm. Tell me this:

13:31.011 --> 13:32.345
have you returned
the parlor set?

13:32.379 --> 13:33.480
No.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.581
Not yet. Why?

13:34.614 --> 13:38.585
Some people are...
visual learners.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.922
So if Wade doesn't
understand what you're
trying to tell him...

13:41.955 --> 13:44.491
Right. I have
to show him.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.927
Follow my lead.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.228
Excuse me,
Crickett.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.063
I hate to
interrupt

13:50.097 --> 13:51.631
calendar protocol, but
Lemon has an emergency,

13:51.664 --> 13:53.100
Code Red.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.267
(gasps)
By all means.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.268
LEMON:
Okay, Belles,

13:55.302 --> 13:56.469
listen up.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.338
As you know, I have
recently taken over

13:58.371 --> 13:59.907
the management of
the Rammer Jammer.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.075
Tonight is our
very first big event.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.944
It will be a...

14:03.977 --> 14:04.945
wine tasting.

14:04.978 --> 14:05.979
It will
be...

14:06.013 --> 14:07.580
classy and elegant,

14:07.614 --> 14:09.649
and most importantly,
well-attended.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.750
That's right.

14:10.783 --> 14:13.320
Which is why we are invoking
the emergency phone tree

14:13.353 --> 14:14.587
to spread the word, so...

14:14.621 --> 14:17.390
(clicks tongue)
...hop to.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.160
Oh.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.365
JONAH:
 What did you do?

14:25.398 --> 14:26.599
What?

14:26.633 --> 14:29.136
I just came from
the Breelands'.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.938
Shelby left this taped to
the front door.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.075
(sighs)
"Dearest Brick,

14:35.108 --> 14:36.376
"I can't tell
you how sorry

14:36.409 --> 14:37.677
"I am, which is why

14:37.710 --> 14:38.745
"I am writing
this note instead.

14:38.778 --> 14:41.514
"I will not be able to
take you to the hospital,

14:41.548 --> 14:43.050
"and I can't
see you anymore.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.218
By the time
you read this..."

14:45.252 --> 14:46.353
She left town?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.055
Left town, left him...
she's gone.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.656
It's all right there
in the letter.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.324
Well, that's awful,

14:51.358 --> 14:52.525
but it's not my fault.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.660
No?

14:53.693 --> 14:55.095
Keep reading.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.332
"I was in denial
until Zoe Hart...

14:59.366 --> 15:00.300
"opened my eyes

15:00.333 --> 15:03.336
"to the risks associated
with brain surgery.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.671
I went right to Google..."

15:04.704 --> 15:06.039
Oh, geez.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.207
Yeah. Nice work.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.642
We have to find her
and fix this.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.111
(sighs) Stupid Google.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.113
Right. It's Google's fault.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.352
CHICKEN:
Mermaids are real.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.353
100%. 110%.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.388
RUDY:
It's true facts.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.689
I've seen two,
maybe three.

15:22.722 --> 15:23.723
Hey, George.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.692
Are you catching the talent
at the next table?

15:25.725 --> 15:27.961
Huh? Let's
invite 'em over.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.062
You can have
the blonde.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.098
GEORGE:
Uh... Rocket...

15:31.131 --> 15:33.000
I'm with
your sister.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.969
You... you do
know that, right?

15:37.337 --> 15:38.571
Yeah.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.640
Yeah, that...
that was a test.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.475
And you
passed.
(laughing)

15:42.509 --> 15:44.244
Oh, I knew that.
A-plus.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.213
I-I knew...
I... oh.
(explosion noise)

15:46.246 --> 15:47.447
Okay. Here's what
we're gonna do.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.616
We order two of
everything on the menu,

15:49.649 --> 15:51.018
wait ten
minutes,

15:51.051 --> 15:52.585
then ditch.
Oh!

15:52.619 --> 15:54.254
What? No.
Shh, shh.
Here he comes,

15:54.287 --> 15:55.388
here he comes.
Be cool, act natural.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.723
(clears throat)

15:56.756 --> 15:58.025
Hey, Tucker.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.559
I see you've met
the brothers Truitt.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.461
Wade Kinsella.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.063
Screw over anybody's
sister lately?

16:03.096 --> 16:04.464
WADE: Well, they do
have a long memory.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.732
It's their best feature.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.267
Thank you.
Let me
guess:

16:07.300 --> 16:09.169
Chicken's been drinking
since he woke up,

16:09.202 --> 16:12.072
Rocket's been making googly eyes
at these gals over here,

16:12.105 --> 16:14.141
and, uh,
Rudy just wants to order

16:14.174 --> 16:15.408
everything on the menu,
then ditch.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.544
That is an outrageous
accusation.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.679
We want to register a
complaint with the owner.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.081
I am the owner, Rudy.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.316
(laughing)

16:23.350 --> 16:25.285
He's the
owner?

16:25.318 --> 16:28.755
No, I mean the guy who actually
 owns this restaurant.

16:28.788 --> 16:29.756
Go get him.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.091
Guys, actually...

16:31.124 --> 16:32.392
No, it's all right, Tucker.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.561
I won't let the Truitt Trio
ruin my good mood.

16:34.594 --> 16:35.628
Guess what?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.030
You enjoy your lunch.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.198
All right?
I'll catch you all later.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.666
Rocket, pass out
them straws.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.234
Chicken, start
making spitballs.
What?

16:41.268 --> 16:42.635
No. No, no...

16:42.669 --> 16:44.104
no spit...
give me that.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.305
No spitballs.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.575
Guys, look, Wade is a friend.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.511
And I know he's got
a history with Tansy,

16:51.544 --> 16:53.246
and everything,
but the way I see it,

16:53.280 --> 16:55.448
if things wouldn't have ended

16:55.482 --> 16:58.251
the way they did with
the two of them, then I...

16:58.285 --> 17:00.320
I never would've had a chance
to date your sister.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.688
Okay?

17:02.722 --> 17:04.590
He's right.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.627
It's true,
what Tansy says.

17:08.661 --> 17:11.064
You are one in a million,
George Tucker.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.531
I declare you

17:12.565 --> 17:13.700
an honorary Truitt.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.268
Let's get plowed!

17:15.301 --> 17:16.303
Yeah!
(laughing)

17:16.336 --> 17:17.704
I have been
all over town,

17:17.737 --> 17:19.271
and no one
has seen her.

17:19.306 --> 17:20.540
Well, Brick's supposed to be
at the hospital

17:20.573 --> 17:21.641
in less than an hour.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.410
Maybe we just bite the bullet,
and-and we tell him.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.676
Absolutely not.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.546
Brick needs his rock
by his side. He said so.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.548
It is my fault
that Shelby took off.

17:28.581 --> 17:29.816
I have to get her back here.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.084
Did you do your homework?

17:31.118 --> 17:32.752
Are we really gonna
stoop to this?

17:32.785 --> 17:34.421
Mm-hmm.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.556
Here you go.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.458
Shelby's Internet history
from the last month.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.229
If I wanted to snoop
through people's computers,

17:42.262 --> 17:43.430
I would have become a lawyer.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.465
Aha!
"Aha"?

17:45.498 --> 17:46.466
Did you just say "aha"?

17:46.499 --> 17:48.635
"Stow That Stuff."
What? Hmm?

17:48.668 --> 17:50.170
Stow That Stuff. It's
the name of the store.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.838
Check out the dates.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.506
Every since Brick's MRI,
over half

17:53.540 --> 17:55.642
of her retail therapy
has been done at
the same place.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.277
It's an organizer's paradise.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.845
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I-I've been there.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.480
There's one
in the outlet mall. So?

18:00.513 --> 18:04.151
So... what if that store is
her emotional oasis?

18:04.184 --> 18:05.718
Like, where she goes
when she's upset or stressed.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.121
Wow. I am like that
guy, Elementary.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.822
You know that his name's
not Elementary.

18:09.856 --> 18:10.757
You get Brick
to the hospital.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.792
Tell him that Shelby
will meet him there,

18:12.825 --> 18:14.294
and I will make sure
that she does.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.501
It was just another
Belles meeting.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.335
Nothing
special.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.804
Hmm. I was thinking
about dinner.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.539
Uh, how do you feel
about the Rammer Jammer?

18:26.573 --> 18:28.475
Oh, my God, it's
like you read my mind.

18:28.508 --> 18:31.311
I am dying to
go to the Rammer
Jammer tonight.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.879
(chuckles)

18:32.912 --> 18:34.747
What's going on?

18:34.781 --> 18:36.616
(sighs)
It's Lemon.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.218
She has something
awesome planned

18:38.251 --> 18:39.352
for the Rammer
Jammer tonight,

18:39.386 --> 18:40.820
and I think
we should go.

18:42.455 --> 18:46.259
Lemon's... throwing
something at the
Rammer Jammer?

18:46.293 --> 18:47.494
Tonight?

18:47.527 --> 18:49.396
Yeah, it's kind
of a surprise.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.530
For Wade.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.265
But she doesn't
want him to know

18:52.299 --> 18:53.800
until he see it,
so... (giggles)

18:53.833 --> 18:54.901
What?

18:54.934 --> 18:56.102
Lavon?

18:56.135 --> 18:59.406
You didn't elect me union rep
because of my good looks.

18:59.439 --> 19:00.773
I got an agenda here.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.809
We're gonna go through it,
point by point.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.845
First off,
did everybody get a hat?

19:05.878 --> 19:07.914
Then she said, "The Rammer
Jammer needs a flat-screen

19:07.947 --> 19:09.716
like a flounder
needs a Ferrari."

19:09.749 --> 19:10.950
I mean, that's crazy talk.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.819
You know, there are live
sporting events on TV

19:12.852 --> 19:14.254
24 hours a day.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.356
Sports that aren't
gonna watch themselves.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.491
For example, you know, tonight,
there's a Mixed Martial Arts

19:18.525 --> 19:19.692
World Championship
on pay-per-view.

19:19.726 --> 19:20.760
Of course there is.

19:20.793 --> 19:21.761
Now, see, that's
the kind of event

19:21.794 --> 19:22.795
that would fill a bar.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.365
You return that
flat-screen yet?

19:25.398 --> 19:26.666
Not yet. Why?

19:26.699 --> 19:27.800
Well, I'm thinking

19:27.834 --> 19:29.502
if she's not going
to listen to reason,

19:29.536 --> 19:31.404
what she needs is
a demonstration.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.539
All right,
watch this.

19:32.572 --> 19:33.940
Hey, Sal, sorry
to interrupt, man,

19:33.973 --> 19:36.676
but, um, my good friend
and longtime member

19:36.709 --> 19:38.445
of the BlueBell
Longshoreman's Union

19:38.478 --> 19:39.779
has an announcement to make.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.147
Wade.
Uh...

19:41.180 --> 19:44.584
Now, some of you may
know I recently took
over the Rammer Jammer...

19:44.617 --> 19:46.286
This is a disaster.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.954
How could you encourage
Wade to hold Fight Night

19:47.987 --> 19:48.888
at the Rammer Jammer?

19:48.921 --> 19:50.557
You know the type of people
that show up

19:50.590 --> 19:51.824
to mixed martial arts?
'Cause I do.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.526
Fight Night is a moneymaker.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.394
Wade is right.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.263
You know, BlueBell needs
a sports bar,

19:56.296 --> 19:59.832
not a-a... wine saloon,
with frilly tablecloths

19:59.866 --> 20:01.234
and antique
sofas.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.702
It is a "salon,"

20:02.735 --> 20:04.504
not a
saloon.
Oh...

20:04.537 --> 20:06.839
And Lemon is
just trying to
elevate the place,

20:06.873 --> 20:08.007
and the people
in it.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.443
Well, as someone who's spent
more than their fair share

20:10.477 --> 20:11.844
at the Rammer Jammer,
I didn't realize

20:11.878 --> 20:13.212
I needed elevating!

20:15.482 --> 20:17.417
We can't do this.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.851
We cannot have our first fight

20:18.885 --> 20:20.287
over those two yahoos.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.688
Okay, we need rules.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.323
Now, for the sake
of our relationship,

20:23.356 --> 20:25.358
we-we swear to steer clear of...

20:25.392 --> 20:27.460
of Wade, Lemon,
and the Rammer Jammer

20:27.494 --> 20:28.895
for the next 24 hours.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.730
Deal.

20:30.763 --> 20:31.898
Shake on it?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.469
That's
one idea.

20:36.503 --> 20:37.904
Wade's
a liar!

20:37.937 --> 20:39.005
A lying liar!

20:39.038 --> 20:41.508
The lyingest liar in Liarville.

20:41.541 --> 20:44.311
Okay, guys, let's-let's dial it
back just a little bit.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.712
You saying he's not a liar?

20:45.745 --> 20:47.514
He said, "Enjoy your lunch,"

20:47.547 --> 20:49.349
and then he kicked us
out of his bar.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.451
That's a liar.
Okay.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.419
Well, to be fair,

20:52.452 --> 20:54.387
you did throw all that
stuff at him, okay?

20:54.421 --> 20:56.389
Napkin dispensers,
and soup,

20:56.423 --> 20:58.358
and all of that
Parmesan cheese.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.627
And then you drew
on the walls.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.696
It's called modern art.
If I was a artist,

21:03.730 --> 21:05.732
people would pay millions
for those drawings.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.967
You're not an artist.
You know

21:08.000 --> 21:09.769
what rhymes with "liar"?

21:09.802 --> 21:11.404
"Lawyer."

21:11.438 --> 21:13.873
No, actually it doesn't.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.408
RUDY:
I got an idea.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.511
Let's find Wade's car
and push it in the lake.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.580
I love it!
RUDY:
Or...

21:20.613 --> 21:22.682
we can pee in his tailpipe.

21:22.715 --> 21:23.883
Pee in the tailpipe!
Pee in the tailpipe!

21:23.916 --> 21:26.986
Or-or we could go back
to my houseboat

21:27.019 --> 21:28.988
and you guys could
sleep it off.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.923
Is this how you lawyers
handle being wronged?

21:30.957 --> 21:32.892
You go home and
you take a nap?

21:32.925 --> 21:34.427
RUDY:
We made you

21:34.461 --> 21:35.762
an honorary Truitt.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.764
I'm not peeing
in his tailpipe!

21:37.797 --> 21:39.466
'Cause you scared?

21:39.499 --> 21:42.469
Or because you don't
pee standin' up?

21:42.502 --> 21:44.371
(laughing)
CHICKEN:
It's okay, it's okay.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.539
You can do it
from a sittin' position.

21:46.573 --> 21:47.840
I pee like everyone else!

21:47.874 --> 21:50.377
Okay? And I can pee

21:50.410 --> 21:52.512
on one leg if I...
You know what? I don't...

21:52.545 --> 21:54.514
I do not need this.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.583
G.T. out.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.388
Wade, you might want
to hide your car.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.925
Take that.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.896
Ooh!

22:09.929 --> 22:11.931
A battery-operated
battery container? Genius.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.867
Zoe! What are you doing here?

22:14.901 --> 22:17.136
I am bringing you
to the hospital.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.971
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not going there.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.474
Oop!
Wahoo!
Brick needs you.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.444
I saw your note and I'm sorry
if I scared you off.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.413
This has nothing to do with you.

22:26.446 --> 22:30.950
I thought I was strong enough
to be at Brick's side when he...

22:30.983 --> 22:32.084
(sighs)

22:32.118 --> 22:34.153
But I learned something
about myself.

22:34.186 --> 22:37.957
I crumble in the face
of sickness, injury

22:37.990 --> 22:40.727
and human frailty,
and my affection for Brick is

22:40.760 --> 22:43.563
just not strong enough
to overcome it.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.967
Shelby, with all due respect,
I don't care.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.403
All I care about is
that you are there

22:50.437 --> 22:51.738
when Brick goes
into the OR.

22:51.771 --> 22:55.141
So, let's go.
I am not going
anywhere with you.

22:55.174 --> 22:58.578
Well, then I guess
you're aren't going anywhere.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.413
Because I have your car keys,

23:00.447 --> 23:04.684
your wallet, and, hmm,
your coupons.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.553
Don't you touch my coupons!

23:06.586 --> 23:08.521
Then don't make me.
You owe this to Brick.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.156
You said you were
gonna there for him,

23:10.189 --> 23:11.791
and you're gonna be
there for him.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.926
You can either
follow me out right now

23:13.960 --> 23:18.731
or I'm gonna rip up
these coupons, and I will.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.066
Ooh.
I'm coming.

23:20.099 --> 23:22.034
I will rip them.
Give me those!

23:22.068 --> 23:23.436
I will rip them.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.572
Give me those coupons!

23:40.186 --> 23:41.921
Sal called.

23:41.954 --> 23:42.922
Shrimp delivery's in.

23:42.955 --> 23:45.191
I was thinking maybe you
could head down there,

23:45.224 --> 23:47.660
quality-control the shrimp
and bring it on back.

23:47.694 --> 23:50.630
Hmm, as I recall, I did the
shrimp delivery last week,

23:50.663 --> 23:52.965
so that would make it
your turn.

23:52.999 --> 23:55.735
Well, as I recall,
I inventoried the
freezer for you

23:55.768 --> 23:58.771
three weeks in a row,
plus my car's not here,

23:58.805 --> 24:00.807
so, uh, maybe you should
take care of that.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.108
(giggles)

24:08.715 --> 24:10.950
It is so nice
not to have the burden

24:10.983 --> 24:13.219
of you-know-who's disputes
hanging over our heads.

24:13.252 --> 24:17.757
Oh, I totally agree.
Hey, let's split up.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.859
I'll get the salad,
you get the dessert,

24:19.892 --> 24:21.694
meet you at the front.

24:21.728 --> 24:23.896
Okay.
All right.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.605
(phone rings)

24:32.639 --> 24:35.241
Lavon, you would not believe
what's going on over here.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.577
I can't get Lemon out
of the Rammer Jammer.

24:37.610 --> 24:38.645
I'm running the cable now,

24:38.678 --> 24:41.581
but I don't see how I'm supposed
to set up the TV.

24:41.614 --> 24:42.682
Okay, listen up now.

24:42.715 --> 24:43.883
You didn't hear this
from me, but...

24:43.916 --> 24:45.585
You need to set up immediately.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.053
I am trying, okay?

24:47.086 --> 24:49.656
Crickett has got a van
full of parlor furniture,

24:49.689 --> 24:51.824
but I can't set up
until Wade leaves.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.560
And he is acting
really squirrely.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.695
I'll bet he is.
Wait till you hear this.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.029
A wine tasting?!

24:57.063 --> 24:59.165
What the hell is
a mixed martial art?!

24:59.198 --> 25:00.199
Just set up the TV.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.133
She can't stop you.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.669
Half that place is yours.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.004
Do not back down.

25:05.037 --> 25:06.739
There you are.

25:06.773 --> 25:08.708
Perfect timing!

25:17.784 --> 25:19.986
Hey, has Brick
gone in yet?

25:20.019 --> 25:21.821
No, no, he's still in pre-op.

25:21.854 --> 25:22.889
How did you get her to...?

25:22.922 --> 25:24.290
I'm a persuasive speaker.

25:24.323 --> 25:26.025
Here on Earth,
we call it kidnapping.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.126
It's a gray area.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.227
Are you sure about this?

25:28.260 --> 25:30.129
Absolutely. You've seen
the studies.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.064
Patients who are going into
surgery knowing

25:32.098 --> 25:33.900
they have a loved one
waiting for them

25:33.933 --> 25:35.935
have fewer complications.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.937
Except, as you may
recall from my note,

25:37.970 --> 25:39.271
I'm no longer his loved one.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.740
Well, he doesn't need
to know that.

25:40.773 --> 25:42.842
All he wants to see
is your smiling face

25:42.875 --> 25:44.176
before he goes under.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.078
So you're gonna march
into that room,

25:46.112 --> 25:49.115
show him that smile,
and be his rock.
Are we clear?

25:49.148 --> 25:51.150
As a tear.

25:51.183 --> 25:53.986
What do you mean, you don't know
where they are?

25:54.020 --> 25:56.088
You just left them?

25:56.122 --> 25:57.990
Tansy, they left me
no choice, okay?

25:58.024 --> 26:00.026
You were right, your
brothers are children.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.194
You can't say that
about my family!

26:02.228 --> 26:05.064
What? You-You
said it yourself!

26:05.097 --> 26:07.133
I'm allowed to.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.367
They're my family!

26:08.400 --> 26:12.338
And you promised that you'd look
out for them! You promised.

26:12.371 --> 26:15.041
Tans... Tansy, hey, baby,
where are you going?

26:15.074 --> 26:18.210
Lord knows what kind
of trouble they got into.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.684
*

26:37.764 --> 26:40.199
I don't see what
the problem is, Lemon.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.802
Several of your closest
and smelliest friends have

26:42.835 --> 26:44.370
established residency
in my salon area.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.706
And those seats are
reserved for the wine club!

26:46.739 --> 26:48.908
Well, If you didn't want
our patrons sitting on

26:48.941 --> 26:50.042
your brand-new furniture,

26:50.076 --> 26:51.243
maybe you should have
returned it

26:51.277 --> 26:52.779
like I told you to!

26:52.812 --> 26:54.146
Oh, you mean the way
that you returned the TV?

26:54.180 --> 26:55.915
Oh, wait, you didn't.

26:55.948 --> 26:59.251
Lemon, the BlueBell Decanters
are getting a little antsy.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.387
Yes.
And we were promised
a California merlot.

27:01.420 --> 27:02.855
And it is coming.

27:02.889 --> 27:04.356
Why don't you get
your group together,

27:04.390 --> 27:07.126
and I'll be right with you?
Thank you.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.728
Yeah, that California merlot?

27:08.761 --> 27:10.863
It's on its way back
to California.

27:10.897 --> 27:12.131
What?!

27:12.164 --> 27:14.433
Yeah. Well, I thought there must
be a mistake with the delivery

27:14.466 --> 27:16.769
seeing as how the wine tasting
wasn't on the books!

27:16.803 --> 27:18.404
Because it was supposed
to be a surprise!

27:18.437 --> 27:20.740
My goodness, I could kill
you right now

27:20.773 --> 27:22.408
and not even lose
a wink of sleep!

27:22.441 --> 27:23.876
You know what?
Hold that thought.

27:23.910 --> 27:26.112
It's fight time.
(chuckles)

27:26.145 --> 27:28.447
All right, party people,
we got a great thing coming.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.416
If y'all would just direct
your attention

27:30.449 --> 27:32.284
to this beautiful, new
flat-screen TV,

27:32.318 --> 27:37.724
I present to you Mixed
Martial Arts championship!

27:37.757 --> 27:39.892
(cheering)
Yeah, baby! (clears throat)

27:39.926 --> 27:42.094
Uh, hold on one second.

27:42.128 --> 27:45.031
Well, it was working
an hour ago. We'll get it again.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.767
Bad news of epic proportions.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.468
The cable's been cut!

27:49.501 --> 27:51.103
Oh, I'm sorry,
was that

27:51.137 --> 27:52.839
a part of your TV thingy?

27:52.872 --> 27:54.406
See, I was outside earlier,

27:54.440 --> 27:55.474
trimming the hedges
of our property

27:55.507 --> 27:58.077
when I saw this white weed
running up the building,

27:58.110 --> 27:59.378
so I clipped it.

28:00.747 --> 28:03.315
And then I clipped it again
just to be sure.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.053
Wade, where's the fight?

28:07.086 --> 28:08.888
Well, I'm-I'm
working on it, Sal.

28:08.921 --> 28:13.893
Work faster. I convinced
my bookie to come here.

28:15.327 --> 28:17.764
You don't want
an unhappy bookie.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.331
He said if there's no fight
to watch,

28:19.365 --> 28:21.868
there's gonna be
a fight to watch.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.235
I think he meant that...

28:23.269 --> 28:24.737
I get it. Thank you.

28:27.306 --> 28:31.143
This evening is not going
at all as planned.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.483
(phone rings)

28:37.516 --> 28:41.087
(clears throat, chuckles)

28:41.120 --> 28:42.288
Hey, Sheriff Bill.

28:42.321 --> 28:45.091
Uh, can you get a message
to Tansy?

28:45.124 --> 28:47.493
I sure can.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.762
I got her brothers
locked up here.

28:49.796 --> 28:52.731
You wouldn't believe what they
were about to do in my tailpipe.

28:54.533 --> 28:58.437
Okay, now remember,
big smile,

28:58.470 --> 29:00.372
then give him a hug and a kiss

29:00.406 --> 29:02.975
and only say
nice supportive things.

29:03.009 --> 29:05.978
Honeybear!

29:06.012 --> 29:07.246
Hey, Shelby!
You made it.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.481
I just came to wish you
good luck.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.417
Well, now that
you're here,

29:11.450 --> 29:13.252
I know everything's
gonna be just fine.

29:13.285 --> 29:16.088
Oh, looks like it's time to get
the show on the road, Brick.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.990
Don't let 'em cut out
anything you might need.

29:18.024 --> 29:20.259
I'll be right here
waiting for ya.
Okay.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.862
No, just wait-wait-wait!
I need to say something.

29:22.895 --> 29:26.132
Shelby, before I go under,

29:26.165 --> 29:30.369
I just, I want you to know
how much I love you.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.239
Aw, Brick...

29:33.272 --> 29:34.907
Now I was gonna wait

29:34.941 --> 29:37.243
until after the surgery
to ask this,

29:37.276 --> 29:39.411
but hell, time waits
for no man, right?

29:39.445 --> 29:41.413
So, Shelby, sweetheart,

29:41.447 --> 29:45.217
I am sorry this is not in a
more romantic setting, but...

29:47.486 --> 29:49.555
...will you marry me?

29:55.928 --> 29:57.596
Yes?

29:57.629 --> 29:58.931
(laughs)

29:58.965 --> 30:01.400
Yeah, all right!

30:01.433 --> 30:05.471
Yeah! (laughs) Oh! Okay!

30:13.512 --> 30:15.114
You happy with yourself?

30:15.147 --> 30:16.448
Okay, I'll admit,
Brick proposing

30:16.482 --> 30:18.084
was an unforeseen bump
in the road,

30:18.117 --> 30:20.152
but overall, not a big deal.
Really?

30:20.186 --> 30:23.222
Not a big deal?
This a big deal to you?

30:23.255 --> 30:25.091
Kind of a big deal.
You didn't have
to say yes!

30:25.124 --> 30:26.192
Of course I did!

30:26.225 --> 30:27.526
Yeah, some plan, Zoe.

30:27.559 --> 30:28.660
A kidnapping,
a proposal. What's next?

30:28.694 --> 30:31.097
Brick gets out of surgery,
Shelby breaks up with him.

30:31.130 --> 30:31.898
Problem solved.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.400
Hell no! I already
wrote that note.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.467
You tell him.

30:35.501 --> 30:36.535
Yeah, "Hey, welcome back Brick.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.938
Here's a big bowl of heartbreak
with your Jell-O!"

30:38.971 --> 30:41.440
Look, Brick was gonna get his
heart broken one way or another.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.075
All we did was defer
the heartbreak

30:43.109 --> 30:44.977
until after the surgery
to save his life.

30:45.011 --> 30:47.146
Is there an Olympic Mental
Gymnastics team?

30:47.179 --> 30:48.514
'Cause you would be a lock.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.032
So, how's that
sauce coming?

31:06.065 --> 31:08.100
Oh, my God, Lavon,
I can't do it anymore!

31:08.134 --> 31:10.102
What?

31:10.136 --> 31:12.038
If I have to keep this lie
from you one second longer,

31:12.071 --> 31:14.106
I think I'll explode.
I know that

31:14.140 --> 31:16.508
we swore up and down that we
would stay out of it,

31:16.542 --> 31:18.510
but I couldn't.
I called Lemon.

31:18.544 --> 31:19.979
You did what now?

31:20.012 --> 31:21.981
I told her about Wade

31:22.014 --> 31:24.616
and the dockworkers

31:24.650 --> 31:26.585
and about fight night.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.489
Say something.

31:30.522 --> 31:32.524
Thank God.
I did the same thing.

31:32.558 --> 31:36.662
You did?!
What is wrong with us?!

31:36.695 --> 31:38.397
Why couldn't
we leave it alone?

31:38.430 --> 31:39.631
I don't know.

31:39.665 --> 31:43.135
You know, maybe one of the
things we like about each other

31:43.169 --> 31:45.137
is what great friends
we are to our friends.

31:45.171 --> 31:47.639
Oh, I like that better
than my answer.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.942
What's that?

31:49.976 --> 31:51.443
That the vacuum created
by their clashing wills

31:51.477 --> 31:53.345
sucked all the air out
of our brains?

31:55.581 --> 31:57.183
Maybe we should get over there.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.052
Okay, here are
your options.

32:00.086 --> 32:03.022
I hold them overnight,
someone bails them out,

32:03.055 --> 32:05.291
or I release them
to your custody.

32:05.324 --> 32:09.028
Well, Sheriff,
they are a handful,

32:09.061 --> 32:12.731
but I think I'm gonna have
to go with option "C."

32:12.764 --> 32:15.601
SHERIFF BILL:
Your custody means
your responsibility.

32:15.634 --> 32:16.635
So be sure.

32:16.668 --> 32:18.037
I'm sure.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.172
I mean, they are
Tansy's brothers.

32:20.206 --> 32:23.509
Which makes them family.

32:23.542 --> 32:26.212
And this is what you do
for family.

32:28.180 --> 32:31.017
Have I said thank you
yet today, George Tucker?

32:31.050 --> 32:33.986
How long have you been
standing there?

32:34.020 --> 32:36.588
Long enough to hear you
call my family yours.

32:36.622 --> 32:40.326
Well, they didn't leave me
much of a choice.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.528
They, uh, they made me
an honorary Truitt.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.063
George Truitt!

32:44.096 --> 32:46.065
(whooping, laughing)

32:46.098 --> 32:47.633
That's right!
Our brother!

32:47.666 --> 32:49.568
Not sure what that makes you,
though, Tansy.

32:49.601 --> 32:50.702
Shut up, idiots.

32:50.736 --> 32:53.472
Hope you like dead bees,
honey and the smell of chemicals

32:53.505 --> 32:55.074
'cause you're gonna be
staying at my trailer

32:55.107 --> 32:56.442
from now on.
(groaning)

32:56.475 --> 32:57.476
And if I hear

32:57.509 --> 32:58.677
that you have even been

32:58.710 --> 33:01.580
in spitting distance
of any more trouble...

33:01.613 --> 33:03.749
I'm calling Mama.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.218
Take me home,

33:06.252 --> 33:07.753
George Tucker.

33:07.786 --> 33:09.721
Yes, ma'am.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.758
You really think
she'd call Mama?

33:12.791 --> 33:13.759
(scoffs)
No.

33:13.792 --> 33:15.494
(whooping)

33:15.527 --> 33:18.230
(laughter)

33:18.264 --> 33:19.498
Good Lord.

33:20.532 --> 33:23.235
LAVON:
What the hell is this?

33:23.269 --> 33:24.536
(cackles)

33:24.570 --> 33:26.205
Wanda?

33:26.238 --> 33:27.339
What's going on?

33:27.373 --> 33:28.540
Welcome to the Rammer Jammer's

33:28.574 --> 33:31.443
first annual
Wine and Fight Night.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.379
Where's the wine?

33:33.412 --> 33:34.613
There is no wine.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.248
And there is no fight.

33:36.282 --> 33:37.483
Y'all enjoy.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.186
(whirring)

33:40.219 --> 33:41.787
Turns out, they don't
even care about wine,

33:41.820 --> 33:43.489
they just wanted
to taste something new.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.557
So I mixed up all these
specialty concoctions.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.259
We're gonna
discuss them later.

33:47.293 --> 33:48.227
You don't say.

33:48.260 --> 33:51.797
Yeah, try this one.
I call it Beyoncé's Navel.

33:51.830 --> 33:52.931
So, I learned
it's human nature.

33:52.964 --> 33:56.168
People like watching athletic
events while they drink.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.636
Any athletic event.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.238
(chuckles)
Even ladies arm wrestling.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.073
Crickett is really strong.

34:01.107 --> 34:02.408
(arm crunches on table)
Ow.

34:02.441 --> 34:03.409
Boo-ya!

34:03.442 --> 34:04.310
Who wants some of this?

34:04.343 --> 34:06.378
Hey, Wanda,
tell Lemon the good news.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.347
I just did a
preliminary accounting,

34:08.380 --> 34:10.116
and this has already
been the biggest night

34:10.149 --> 34:11.850
the Rammer Jammer's had
since you two took over.

34:11.882 --> 34:12.717
We're flush.

34:12.751 --> 34:15.087
(squeals)
And the night is still young!

34:15.121 --> 34:16.121
Up high, partner.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.223
What up.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.491
You know this is all
'cause of us, right?

34:19.525 --> 34:22.328
Up high, partner.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.362
(rhythmic beeping)

34:29.900 --> 34:31.703
We talked
to your surgeon.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.505
He said it was
a total success.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.241
You can expect a full recovery.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.875
You'll be back
to your cranky self

34:36.908 --> 34:38.844
within days.

34:38.877 --> 34:41.780
Okay, so...

34:41.813 --> 34:45.251
why are y'all looking at me
like someone died?

34:45.284 --> 34:47.553
Look, there's something
that you should know.

34:47.585 --> 34:48.887
Oh, my God!

34:48.920 --> 34:51.190
Your doctor gave me
the good news, bless his heart.

34:51.223 --> 34:53.225
Oh, actually, we were
just telling him...

34:53.259 --> 34:56.295
You are out of the woods
and I just wanted to say...

34:57.363 --> 34:59.298
I can't wait to marry you

34:59.331 --> 35:01.167
and start our lives together.

35:02.268 --> 35:03.302
Was I interrupting something?

35:11.810 --> 35:13.879
And despite our upper
management issues,

35:13.912 --> 35:16.548
we managed to pull together
a pretty kick-ass night.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.484
We might consider that
there is room enough

35:18.517 --> 35:20.686
for bo of our visions.

35:20.719 --> 35:23.189
Maybe the Rammer Jammer
just needs to be big enough

35:23.222 --> 35:25.491
for wine tastings
and UFC championships.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.693
Maybe all we need
is more space.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.495
Right.

35:29.528 --> 35:32.431
And to that end, what
if we tore down that
wall over there?

35:32.464 --> 35:34.633
We could turn
our storage area into,

35:34.666 --> 35:37.636
get this, a
function room.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.505
For special events.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.473
Wine tastings. Fight night.

35:41.507 --> 35:42.641
Book club,
fight club.

35:42.674 --> 35:46.178
I mean, how hard is it
to take down a wall?

35:48.247 --> 35:49.815
You are a human wrecking ball.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.251
Just when I thought you
couldn't make things any worse.

35:52.284 --> 35:53.619
Maybe she had
a change of heart.

35:53.652 --> 35:54.753
I think it's sweet.
Yeah?

35:54.786 --> 35:56.255
You think it's gonna last?

35:56.288 --> 35:57.923
Thanks to you,
Brick is gonna marry a woman

35:57.956 --> 35:59.891
who will most certainly
not be sticking with him

35:59.925 --> 36:01.293
in sickness and in health.

36:01.327 --> 36:02.528
We don't know that for sure.

36:03.562 --> 36:04.530
Okay, maybe we do.

36:04.563 --> 36:05.531
It's not your place.

36:05.564 --> 36:07.833
I mean, wh-why did you
have to get involved?

36:07.866 --> 36:10.168
Because I didn't want him
to die, all right?

36:11.937 --> 36:13.572
I will deny this
if you ever repeat it,

36:13.605 --> 36:15.474
but that stubborn, crabby jerk

36:15.507 --> 36:18.710
is the closest thing I've got
to a father in this town.

36:21.347 --> 36:23.582
Okay. I... I get it.

36:25.284 --> 36:28.354
And if you want...

36:28.387 --> 36:29.655
I can tell Brick about Shelby.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.357
I mean, it's not like
I didn't participate.

36:31.390 --> 36:32.724
No. It's my fault.

36:32.758 --> 36:35.827
As soon as Shelby leaves,
I'll do it.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.829
(sighs)

36:38.864 --> 36:40.566
All right, on three.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.334
One... two...

36:42.368 --> 36:43.402
three!

36:43.435 --> 36:44.403
(grunts)

36:55.046 --> 36:56.882
Holy crap, it's rotted.

36:56.915 --> 36:58.784
What? (yelps)

37:06.425 --> 37:08.827
(Wade coughs)

37:08.860 --> 37:10.429
Oh...

37:10.462 --> 37:11.463
(electrical crackling)

37:11.497 --> 37:13.332
Wade?

37:13.365 --> 37:16.034
How much is this
gonna cost to fix?

37:16.067 --> 37:17.469
Uh...

37:17.503 --> 37:19.805
a lot more than we made tonight.

37:19.838 --> 37:22.007
Oh...

37:24.343 --> 37:26.378
(sighs)

37:26.412 --> 37:27.846
(rhythmic beeping)

37:27.879 --> 37:29.848
(sighs)

37:31.383 --> 37:32.484
Oh,

37:32.518 --> 37:33.885
it is true what they say.

37:33.919 --> 37:36.788
There is nothing more boring
than a hospital room.

37:36.822 --> 37:39.658
Believe it or not,
I am glad to see you.

37:39.691 --> 37:42.027
Well, then, you should try
to hold on to that feeling,

37:42.060 --> 37:44.363
because there's something
I need to tell you.

37:44.396 --> 37:47.065
Whoa. Anything starts
like that cannot be good.

37:47.098 --> 37:47.966
(exhales)

37:47.999 --> 37:51.503
Listen, as much
as you care about Shelby,

37:51.537 --> 37:53.639
and I know that you do,

37:53.672 --> 37:55.374
I believe that you're making

37:55.407 --> 37:56.642
the biggest mistake
of your life.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.577
Yep, and I was right.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.512
Shelby left town
because she couldn't deal

38:00.546 --> 38:01.780
with you being sick.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.482
She left you a note.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.851
I had to drag her back here.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.018
She's a fair-weather fiancée

38:07.052 --> 38:10.956
who can't be trusted to stay
with you for better or worse.

38:10.989 --> 38:14.393
Well, maybe for better,
but no one stays better forever.

38:15.427 --> 38:18.029
And what's the bad news?

38:18.063 --> 38:21.967
Hey, she panicked, Zoe.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.034
It happens.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.836
And who knows, maybe she was

38:24.870 --> 38:26.405
afraid that-that I would die

38:26.438 --> 38:28.507
and that she would
be left alone.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.942
But certainly you
can understand

38:30.976 --> 38:33.545
how that fear can make
one act irrationally.

38:33.579 --> 38:36.948
Like maybe kidnap someone,

38:36.982 --> 38:38.784
or threaten their coupons.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.652
She told you?

38:40.686 --> 38:42.988
(laughs)

38:43.021 --> 38:44.356
Hey.

38:44.390 --> 38:47.493
Truth is, I-I love Shelby.

38:47.526 --> 38:48.860
I can't help it.

38:48.894 --> 38:50.829
And-and I will just
take all the time

38:50.862 --> 38:52.898
that she is gonna
give me and...

38:52.931 --> 38:54.132
and consider it a gift.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.568
Even if you know that
it might not last?

38:56.602 --> 38:57.903
You're willing
to take that risk?

38:57.936 --> 39:01.473
Zoe, we are all
gonna die alone.

39:02.140 --> 39:03.909
You know why I proposed

39:03.942 --> 39:05.477
when I did?

39:05.511 --> 39:07.779
Because, God forbid,

39:07.813 --> 39:10.449
if I hadn't made it
to the other side,

39:10.482 --> 39:12.984
at least I put my
cards on the table.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.754
I let Shelby know how I felt.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.723
So if there's someone

39:17.756 --> 39:19.991
that you care about
in this world,

39:20.025 --> 39:23.529
the risk lies in not
letting them know

39:23.562 --> 39:25.497
while you have the chance.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.167
ZOE:
Hey.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.502
Are you alone?
Uh...

39:30.536 --> 39:31.603
yeah.

39:31.637 --> 39:33.004
What are you doing here?
(chuckles)

39:33.038 --> 39:34.473
George.

39:34.506 --> 39:36.908
I have learned that
life is unpredictable.

39:38.076 --> 39:39.745
For example: I almost
choked to death

39:39.778 --> 39:41.146
the other day on
a donut hole.

39:41.179 --> 39:42.948
Oh.
I'm okay.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.149
But I realized

39:44.182 --> 39:46.151
that I don't want
to die with regrets.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.753
Which is why I'm here.

39:47.786 --> 39:50.456
To tell you that I made
a mistake when I told you

39:50.489 --> 39:52.758
that we shouldn't date the day
after you didn't get married.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.826
A huge,

39:54.860 --> 39:56.762
life-altering mistake.

39:56.795 --> 39:59.665
And I'm hoping that it is not
too late to change things.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.067
Because, well,

40:02.100 --> 40:04.570
I like you.

40:04.603 --> 40:05.771
I still like you.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.439
I still more than like you.

40:07.473 --> 40:09.808
Actually, I'm pretty sure
that you are the one for me,

40:09.841 --> 40:11.543
and I realize that my
timing is terrible

40:11.577 --> 40:12.744
because you are
currently with someone,

40:12.778 --> 40:14.513
but I need you to know.

40:14.546 --> 40:15.781
Because no regrets!

40:16.848 --> 40:18.684
And now you know.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.187
That's all.

40:22.220 --> 40:23.789
I'm not expecting
a response right now.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.591
Oh, you're gonna get one, Zoe,

40:25.624 --> 40:26.692
and it's this:

40:27.859 --> 40:29.695
(shouts):
Are you out of your
freaking mind right now?!

40:29.728 --> 40:31.530
Seriously.

40:31.563 --> 40:34.666
You had every opportunity
in the world to be with me,

40:34.700 --> 40:36.468
and you didn't take it.

40:36.502 --> 40:39.070
You sent me out to go find
a real relationship.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.539
Well, guess what I found?

40:40.572 --> 40:42.541
A real relationship.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.943
It's with Tansy,
and it's awesome.

40:44.976 --> 40:49.147
So, I am sorry if you almost

40:49.180 --> 40:51.049
choked to death with a head
full of regrets.

40:51.082 --> 40:52.217
That must have been very scary.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.885
But next time...

40:56.154 --> 40:58.524
...take smaller bites.

41:05.263 --> 41:06.532
Okay. I regret that.
