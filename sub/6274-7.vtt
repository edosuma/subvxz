was because you dumped me
for some dickhead director

'cause they didn't have
a choice.

45:40.856 --> 45:42.689
Helen:
Well, what choice do we have?

45:42.691 --> 45:44.574
Isn't it either this
or nothing, right?

45:48.080 --> 45:51.081
Betty: Actually,
I might know someone

45:51.116 --> 45:54.034
who's a whole lot better
than nothing.

45:55.671 --> 45:58.205
Man: [ Breathing heavily,
moaning ]

45:58.257 --> 46:01.541
William: I talked with
Zookeeper Steve this morning.

46:01.543 --> 46:04.511
They were astounded
at our success with Gil.

46:04.546 --> 46:07.681
Can't imagine how we managed
to pull that off.

46:09.551 --> 46:12.986
Virginia:
Well... what happened yesterday

46:13.021 --> 46:15.589
was no solution at all.

46:15.624 --> 46:18.258
William:
I wasn't looking for a solution.

46:18.293 --> 46:21.261
- I was looking for an answer.
- Virginia: To what?

46:21.330 --> 46:23.797
William: Whether or not
it could be done...

46:23.832 --> 46:27.267
Whether I could do it--
we could do it.

46:27.302 --> 46:29.236
And we did.

46:29.271 --> 46:32.372
There's something
for <i> Newsweek</i> to chew on.

46:32.408 --> 46:35.442
Virginia: We will not tell
<i>Newsweek</i> about this.

46:36.879 --> 46:40.414
William: Gil proves that
performance-based dysfunction

46:40.499 --> 46:42.132
is so rooted in our psyche

46:42.167 --> 46:44.000
that not even
the most primitive of us,

46:44.052 --> 46:47.003
under certain stresses,
are immune to its effects,

46:47.055 --> 46:48.338
but more importantly,

46:48.390 --> 46:52.426
that these dysfunctions
can be repaired by us.

46:52.428 --> 46:54.928
Now, why not let <i> Newsweek</i>
print the story

46:54.980 --> 46:58.765
that says Masters and Johnson
can fix anyone, even an ape?

46:58.817 --> 47:00.734
Virginia:
Because it's not true.

47:00.769 --> 47:02.602
William:
We can straighten out anything

47:02.688 --> 47:04.521
that human beings
manage to screw up.

47:04.573 --> 47:07.441
Virginia: We can't... Bill.

47:07.493 --> 47:10.110
And you know it.

47:10.145 --> 47:15.182
That was a fluke, not a cure,
which is why we cannot say it.

47:19.988 --> 47:23.089
[ Man and woman moaning ]

47:27.529 --> 47:30.714
[ Mid-tempo jazz music playing ]

47:37.556 --> 47:39.306
Helen:
Some doctor's office--

47:39.308 --> 47:41.975
where you can get syphilis
from breathing the air.

47:42.010 --> 47:44.361
What kind of orthopedist
works here?

47:44.396 --> 47:47.063
Betty: These women
don't need an orthopedist?

47:47.115 --> 47:50.116
On their feet all day,
twisting themselves in knots?

47:50.152 --> 47:52.235
Can you imagine
the wear and tear?

47:52.287 --> 47:53.820
Helen:
But for us, for our baby?

47:53.872 --> 47:55.539
Betty:
Honey, honey, he's a doctor

47:55.574 --> 47:58.074
with a face like a movie star
and a body that looks like

47:58.126 --> 48:00.327
it should be throwing
thunderbolts from a cloud.

48:00.329 --> 48:02.996
If you want our baby
to have the best head start,

48:02.998 --> 48:04.197
this is how we do it.

48:04.233 --> 48:05.999
Austin:
Can I help you ladies?

48:06.001 --> 48:07.250
Betty: Oh, Austin!

48:07.302 --> 48:09.386
- So gd to see you.
- Austin: Betty. How are you?

48:09.421 --> 48:10.670
- Betty: I'm good.
- Austin: Good.

48:10.672 --> 48:12.222
Betty: Uh, this is
my girlfriend, Helen.

48:12.257 --> 48:13.473
- Austin: Hi, Helen.
- Helen: Hi.

48:13.509 --> 48:15.342
- Austin: Nice to meet you.
- Helen: [ Chuckles ]

48:15.344 --> 48:18.228
Austin: Girlfriends
as in pals from high school

48:18.263 --> 48:20.680
or girlfriends
as in the previous act?

48:20.716 --> 48:23.483
Betty:
We're lovers, Austin.

48:23.519 --> 48:26.820
Austin: Okay.
Whatever works, ladies.

48:26.855 --> 48:28.255
Betty: [ Chuckles ]

48:28.290 --> 48:31.441
Austin: So, uh, what did you
want to speak to me about?

48:35.030 --> 48:39.366
Betty:
We have a favor to ask.

48:39.418 --> 48:41.835
[ Music continues ]

48:45.040 --> 48:46.456
Man: There you go!

48:48.260 --> 48:53.046
Gordon: Mm. And your most,
uh, significant case to date?

48:53.098 --> 48:57.017
Virginia: Oh, we consider
each and every case

48:57.052 --> 48:58.802
significant in its own way.

48:58.854 --> 49:01.521
Gordon: Any chance of narrowing
that down a little?

49:01.557 --> 49:03.940
You know, maybe there's
a celebrity angle

49:03.976 --> 49:06.159
that we can share
with our readers?

49:06.194 --> 49:08.828
Virginia:
Each case, taken together,

49:08.864 --> 49:12.566
makes up the body
of our scientific study.

49:14.469 --> 49:16.536
Gordon:
How about you, Dr. Masters?

49:16.572 --> 49:18.905
You care to respond?

49:18.941 --> 49:21.825
William:
I agree with Mrs. Johnson--

49:21.877 --> 49:24.911
that each case
matters on its own merits.

49:26.331 --> 49:30.884
But if I were to choose one case

49:30.919 --> 49:34.671
that stood out
as particularly meaningful...

49:34.723 --> 49:38.008
it would have to be the one
involving an ape.

49:41.597 --> 49:44.798
Al "The Ape" Neely and his wife,
Isabella Ricci.

49:44.833 --> 49:46.683
Gordon: I'm so glad
you brought them up.

49:46.735 --> 49:48.180
William: Well, since they
themselves have been so public

49:48.268 --> 49:49.319
about their treatment with us,

49:49.397 --> 49:50.570
I feel we can say
they're patients,

49:50.664 --> 49:53.916
although I can't divulge
specifics.

49:53.951 --> 49:55.241
Gordon: All right, then.

49:55.277 --> 49:57.911
In a general way, what-- what
about their case is significant?

49:59.998 --> 50:04.834
William: Well... let's take,
as an example,

50:04.870 --> 50:09.222
a real ape taken
out of its natural habitat,

50:09.257 --> 50:11.958
as a good way of understanding
what happened with the Neelys...

50:11.960 --> 50:16.212
[Inhales sharply]
Because if you take that ape

50:16.264 --> 50:22.385
and damage it in ways that
only humans can inflict damage,

50:22.437 --> 50:27.107
watch it turn itself
into something it's not,

50:27.142 --> 50:32.812
then our job is to take
those shattered parts

50:32.848 --> 50:37.083
and, uh, bring them together,

50:37.119 --> 50:42.155
and allow, through a--
a successful coupling,

50:42.190 --> 50:48.061
those wounds to finally heal.

51:02.761 --> 51:04.411
Man:
[ Imitates gorilla grunting ]

51:05.447 --> 51:07.447
Dan: I figured now
that I know your taste in men,

51:07.482 --> 51:09.749
I'd give you another chance
and ask you out to the movies.

51:09.785 --> 51:10.884
Virginia: [ Chuckles ]

51:12.988 --> 51:15.121
Dan: [ Exhales sharply ]

51:15.157 --> 51:17.457
Virginia:
Oh, God, you're drenched.

51:17.492 --> 51:19.359
How long have you
been sitting there?

51:19.394 --> 51:21.027
Dan: Hours.

51:21.063 --> 51:22.829
And I jammed the zipper
putting it on,

51:22.864 --> 51:25.231
so I'm not sure I'm ever gonna
be able to get this thing off.

51:25.267 --> 51:26.866
[ Laughs ]

51:26.902 --> 51:29.035
Virginia: Well, now I suppose
the only difference

51:29.071 --> 51:31.071
between you and every other man

51:31.106 --> 51:33.573
is that you wear your ape
on the outside.

51:34.676 --> 51:37.477
Dan: I get the feeling
this wasn't a good idea.

51:37.512 --> 51:38.712
Virginia: [ Chuckles ]

51:38.764 --> 51:40.930
I know that you were
trying to be sweet.

51:43.719 --> 51:45.468
Dan: What happened?

51:45.520 --> 51:46.970
What went wrong?

51:48.724 --> 51:51.224
Virginia:
We were successful.

He mated.

51:53.111 --> 51:55.111
Dan: But...?

51:56.865 --> 52:03.369
Virginia: But he... needed
some encouragement...

52:03.405 --> 52:05.739
- from me.
- Dan: Mm-hmm.

52:05.774 --> 52:10.677
Virginia: And I-- I think I may
have taken it a little too far.

52:12.414 --> 52:14.514
Dan: What's too far?

52:19.721 --> 52:24.457
Virginia: I showed my...

52:24.493 --> 52:26.192
Dan: Mm.

52:26.228 --> 52:28.094
Virginia: [ Sighs ]

But did you kiss him?

52:38.907 --> 52:41.808
Virginia: No.

52:41.843 --> 52:43.576
No, I didn't.
