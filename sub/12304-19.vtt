16:25.720 --> 16:28.150
CSI Delko. We just want to ask you a few questions.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.320
All right,

16:34.390 --> 16:35.650
fire away.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.750
They involve cabana suite four.

16:37.820 --> 16:39.890
Where the body was found today.

16:39.950 --> 16:41.390
Mm-hmm. Well...

16:41.450 --> 16:42.690
I was probably there,along with

16:42.750 --> 16:44.250
all the other suites in that wing.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.920
Is it customary to help yourself to the mini-bar in those suites?

16:46.990 --> 16:48.650
What kind of question is that?

16:48.720 --> 16:50.390
What,are you guys the food police?

16:50.450 --> 16:53.150
Do yourself a favor,Ross.

16:53.220 --> 16:56.120
We found your fingerprints on the mini-bar contents.

16:56.190 --> 16:58.750
What were you looking for?

17:00.550 --> 17:03.250
Why don't you open up the trunk,Ross?

17:03.320 --> 17:04.819
Come on.

17:05.790 --> 17:06.790
(keyless entry beeps)

17:19.520 --> 17:22.190
Ho.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.119
Couple hundred grand here.

17:26.390 --> 17:28.550
(sighs): All right.

17:28.620 --> 17:31.190
Mr. Lansing's girl left her keys in the lobby.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.020
Just don't forget to tell him,Anna,

17:36.090 --> 17:38.690
he'll see the rest next week.

17:40.850 --> 17:42.250
<i>Then I saw the money.</i>

17:43.490 --> 17:44.990
What are you doing here?

17:45.050 --> 17:47.490
Uh,the woman forgot her car keys.

17:47.550 --> 17:49.120
Thank you. It was open.

17:49.190 --> 17:50.690
Go.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.720
So you drugged the room service tray,

17:53.790 --> 17:56.190
then went back and killed Mr. Lansing for the money.

17:56.420 --> 17:58.550
No. No,they were sleeping when I got there,

17:58.620 --> 18:00.250
and they were sleeping when I left.

18:18.590 --> 18:20.190
Wha...?

18:20.250 --> 18:22.220
Come on,they weren't dead, they were alive.

18:24.420 --> 18:27.990
You're under arrest. Theft,false imprisonment.

18:30.690 --> 18:32.790
Ryan? Yeah?

18:32.850 --> 18:34.820
Have you seen Horatio?

18:34.890 --> 18:36.590
No,I haven't. Why,what's up?

18:36.650 --> 18:38.550
Think I found a connection between our dead guy and O'Shay.

18:38.620 --> 18:40.490
Is that right? State lets

18:40.550 --> 18:43.190
the American Indian put casinos on the reservations.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.050
Right,as reparations for stealing the land

18:45.120 --> 18:46.220
out from under them.

18:46.290 --> 18:47.550
Since then, the Kipayo Casinos

18:47.620 --> 18:48.850
have made them all millionaires.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.290
And the revenues divided up

18:50.350 --> 18:51.650
amongst the tribe members,isn't it?

18:51.720 --> 18:55.120
Uh-huh. O'Shay's getting a piece of the action.

18:55.190 --> 18:57.220
You're kidding me.

18:57.290 --> 18:59.590
How'd he manage that? Pushed the casino bill forward.

18:59.650 --> 19:01.490
And he arranged for our victim,Doug Lansing,

19:01.550 --> 19:04.550
to get on the Indian Legislative Board.

19:04.620 --> 19:07.120
Lansing is pulling the legal strings

19:07.190 --> 19:09.050
and O'Shay's getting the kickbacks.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.990
Yeah,that couple hundred thou we snatched from the bellboy?

19:12.050 --> 19:13.350
Yeah... Tip of the iceberg.

19:14.990 --> 19:16.850
I'll tell H.

19:18.790 --> 19:22.020
I was moving money for O'Shay.

19:22.090 --> 19:24.220
But I wasn't getting any of it.

19:24.290 --> 19:26.650
I was just taking it from one place to another.

19:26.720 --> 19:30.520
And how long did this go on?

19:30.590 --> 19:32.050
Two years.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.220
Why?

19:33.290 --> 19:38.220
What does he have on you?

19:38.290 --> 19:39.990
I can't.

19:40.050 --> 19:41.090
I can't say...

19:41.150 --> 19:44.150
You mean you won't say.

19:44.220 --> 19:46.850
So what,you're giving up on me now?

19:46.920 --> 19:48.120
No.

19:48.190 --> 19:50.920
I'm driving you home.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.050
Come on.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.820
ANNA: Thank you,Horatio.

19:59.050 --> 20:00.690
Anna.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.220
Oh,my God! Someone's broken in.

20:02.290 --> 20:04.150
Step back.

20:07.990 --> 20:10.150
Oh,no!

20:14.590 --> 20:15.690
What are you doing?

20:15.750 --> 20:17.190
Anna...

20:17.250 --> 20:19.050
is something missing?

20:20.520 --> 20:21.750
My book.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.820
What book? It had names

20:23.890 --> 20:25.090
and phone numbers

20:25.150 --> 20:26.450
and clients.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.750
Not my clients,Tess's.

20:28.820 --> 20:30.220
Why do you have it?

20:30.290 --> 20:32.350
It was left to me when she died.

20:33.650 --> 20:36.990
Horatio,everybody's in it.

20:37.050 --> 20:38.890
We'd better find that book.

20:38.950 --> 20:40.550
HELICOPTER PILOT: Attention all South Beach units.

20:40.620 --> 20:42.920
253-F to a residential burglary.

20:42.990 --> 20:45.920
Suspect last seen in the area of 14th and Collins.

20:47.990 --> 20:49.690
(siren blares)

20:58.890 --> 21:00.490
Miami-Dade PD.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.450
Whoa. Whoa,whoa,whoa. Get your hands up.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.120
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

21:04.190 --> 21:05.520
What are you doing?

21:05.590 --> 21:06.720
I'm just getting some footage

21:06.790 --> 21:08.490
of your investigation, that's all.

21:10.090 --> 21:11.950
Well,if you're looking to up your ratings,

21:12.020 --> 21:13.190
you've come to the wrong place.

21:13.250 --> 21:14.820
We're just investigating a burglary.

21:14.890 --> 21:16.290
Oh,I know.

21:16.350 --> 21:18.320
How's that? Because I saw the guy

21:18.390 --> 21:20.590
ripping this place off about 90 minutes ago.

21:20.650 --> 21:21.950
He broke in through the front door.

21:22.020 --> 21:25.090
<i>I shot the whole thing.</i>

21:26.590 --> 21:28.390
Really? You just happened to be here?

21:28.450 --> 21:30.350
Well,you make your own luck.

21:30.420 --> 21:32.820
I was down the street,I got wind of a domestic disturbance

21:32.890 --> 21:36.290
over the police scanner, but,uh,this was better.

21:36.350 --> 21:37.820
You're a stringer.

21:37.890 --> 21:39.720
Yeah,I videotape crime scenes and accidents.

21:39.790 --> 21:42.390
You ever hear of us, onthescenenews. com?

21:42.450 --> 21:44.020
Nope. You can't live

21:44.090 --> 21:46.150
without us,they pay top dollar for my stuff.

21:46.220 --> 21:48.290
Did you see who broke into this apartment?

21:48.350 --> 21:49.890
Already got two stations interested.

21:49.950 --> 21:52.050
You guys,uh,you want in on the bidding?

21:52.120 --> 21:53.550
Aw,come on,now.

21:53.620 --> 21:55.520
You know Miami-Dade doesn't bid for evidence.

21:55.590 --> 21:58.590
Wow. That's... that's too bad.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.520
I'll just put you under a microscope.

22:01.590 --> 22:02.690
Unlawful business practice,

22:02.750 --> 22:04.490
trespassing,harassment.

22:04.550 --> 22:06.620
Right.

22:08.290 --> 22:09.850
Here's the tape.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.690
Thank you kindly.

22:15.150 --> 22:16.550
Hey,Leo. What are you doing here?

22:16.620 --> 22:18.090
Filling in.

22:18.150 --> 22:21.390
Cooper has a Graphical User Interface seminar.

22:21.450 --> 22:23.390
Oh. I must have missed that one.

22:23.450 --> 22:26.690
You here about the video Calleigh brought in?

22:26.750 --> 22:29.090
Yeah. So is this stringer guy going to be able to help us?

22:29.150 --> 22:30.550
Well,he's definitely got footage

22:30.620 --> 22:33.090
from the break-in. This is your bad guy coming out.

22:33.150 --> 22:36.850
WOLFE: And there's Anna Sivarro's place.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.550
There's the book.

22:38.620 --> 22:41.390
Could we get a better look at his face?

22:41.450 --> 22:43.420
No.

22:43.490 --> 22:46.720
Our cameraman was hiding. He had a lousy vantage point.

22:46.790 --> 22:49.450
I can't help but feel like Cooper would find a way,but...

22:49.520 --> 22:52.350
Hmm. Working the new guy.

22:52.420 --> 22:53.850
Yeah. That's right.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.590
Okay,okay.

22:59.520 --> 23:03.090
Are you sharpening the image?

23:03.150 --> 23:04.650
Uh,no. Rebuilding it.

23:04.720 --> 23:05.720
See,our image is blurry,

23:05.790 --> 23:07.690
so I'm replacing each bad pixel

23:07.750 --> 23:09.650
with a clear one from a neighboring frame.

23:15.790 --> 23:17.190
There's his face.

23:17.250 --> 23:19.320
That's great. Now,is this enough for us to use

23:19.390 --> 23:20.820
to compare in the photo database?

23:20.890 --> 23:23.150
I think so.

23:28.850 --> 23:30.420
Louis Sullivan.

23:30.490 --> 23:32.620
Looks like breaking and entering is a hobby.

23:32.690 --> 23:34.820
Yeah,I'm going to have Homicide pick him up.

23:34.890 --> 23:37.650
And Leo,not bad.

23:40.890 --> 23:43.190
You got to be kidding me.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.450
Somebody videotaped me?

23:45.520 --> 23:48.690
You're lucky you didn't make it onto the news. So let me

23:48.750 --> 23:51.320
ask you something. What kind of thief breaks into an apartment

23:51.390 --> 23:54.690
but passes on the cash and passes on the credit cards?

23:54.750 --> 23:57.950
A thief that is looking for a black book. Right,Louis?

24:05.350 --> 24:07.550
♪ ♪

24:15.720 --> 24:18.020
Who paid you to steal it?

24:18.090 --> 24:19.620
Nobody...

24:19.690 --> 24:21.750
yet.

24:21.820 --> 24:24.350
The dude who hired me wanted proof that I had it.

24:24.420 --> 24:26.220
So I photocopied a couple of pages

24:26.290 --> 24:28.050
and sent them over to him.

24:35.220 --> 24:37.390
He said we'd be in touch.

24:37.450 --> 24:39.520
Who wanted the book?

24:39.590 --> 24:42.420
I think it's time for my free lawyer.

24:42.490 --> 24:44.050
'Cause if I start opening my mouth,

24:44.120 --> 24:46.590
things are going to get a whole lot worse for me.

25:03.220 --> 25:04.650
Tess Gowan's

25:04.720 --> 25:06.350
infamous black book.

25:06.420 --> 25:09.050
Reads like a who's who of Miami.

25:09.120 --> 25:11.490
Athletes, business leaders,judges...

25:11.550 --> 25:15.490
Imagine the lives ruined if this made the press,Eric.

25:15.550 --> 25:17.820
No doubt.

25:17.890 --> 25:20.090
Got our victim- Doug Lansing.

25:20.150 --> 25:22.490
And Supervisor

25:22.550 --> 25:24.750
Scott O'Shay.

25:24.820 --> 25:27.690
Who is this guy Reggie Veston?

25:27.750 --> 25:29.450
Well,the handwriting below the name and number

25:29.520 --> 25:31.450
is inconsistent with the other entries.

25:31.520 --> 25:35.320
Probably because Anna made that entry,and Tess didn't.

25:36.590 --> 25:39.650
This one,too.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.650
Karl Bennett.

25:41.720 --> 25:44.050
It's a 404 area code. That's Atlanta.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.990
That's a long way to travel.

25:46.050 --> 25:48.250
It certainly is.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.090
There must be a reason.

25:50.150 --> 25:51.320
Excuse me.

25:53.090 --> 25:55.450
(phone dialing)

25:55.520 --> 25:56.620
MAN: Hello.

25:56.690 --> 25:57.990
Karl Bennett,please.

25:58.050 --> 25:59.590
Yes. Who is this?

25:59.650 --> 26:01.350
Yes,Karl. This is Horatio Caine,

26:01.420 --> 26:02.790
from the Miami Crime Lab.

26:02.850 --> 26:04.650
I'm calling about Anna Sivarro.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.920
Is she dead?

26:06.990 --> 26:08.290
Uh,no,she's not,Karl.

26:08.350 --> 26:09.890
What is the nature of your relationship?

26:09.950 --> 26:11.550
She knows not to contact me.

26:11.620 --> 26:13.720
Nobody she knows is ever to call me.

26:13.790 --> 26:16.150
It's a direct violation of our agreement.

26:16.220 --> 26:18.390
Your agreement? Would you mind describing that?

26:18.450 --> 26:20.450
A court order for custody.

26:20.520 --> 26:23.920
Um... custody? As in child custody.

26:23.990 --> 26:26.550
Yes,it is. Anything else?

26:26.620 --> 26:28.820
Uh... No,Karl. That's all I need.

26:28.890 --> 26:29.890
Thank you.

26:44.250 --> 26:46.190
Hi,Alexx. Hi.

26:46.250 --> 26:48.250
So,we get a COD on Doug Lansing?

26:48.320 --> 26:50.020
Exsanguination. Severed pulmonary artery.

26:50.090 --> 26:52.220
But that's not why I called you over.

26:54.820 --> 26:56.420
It's the victim's scalp.

26:59.490 --> 27:02.520
Take a look at the soft tissue on the leading edge.

27:08.520 --> 27:11.520
No bone was fragmented.

27:10.490 --> 27:12.790
So this is a sliver of whatever killed him.

27:12.850 --> 27:15.450
Say hello to your murder weapon.

27:15.520 --> 27:18.390
I heard that Alexx found a piece of the murder weapon

27:18.450 --> 27:19.820
in the victim's scalp.

27:19.890 --> 27:21.750
She did,and it's definitely skeletal.

27:21.820 --> 27:23.990
Animal? Yeah.

27:24.050 --> 27:25.890
It's calcified. It's brittle.

27:29.990 --> 27:32.650
It's got a protein base.

27:32.720 --> 27:35.020
So it's not mineral. That rules out ivory.

27:35.090 --> 27:36.850
The outer surface is rough,

27:36.920 --> 27:41.020
inner cavity spongy yet vascular.

27:41.090 --> 27:42.490
Bet it could be a deer antler.

27:42.550 --> 27:43.720
Deer antler,huh?

27:43.790 --> 27:45.350
What are you basing that on?

27:45.420 --> 27:47.520
My dad used to hunt.

27:47.590 --> 27:49.150
This is old and discolored.

27:49.220 --> 27:51.250
It's like it's an artifact.

27:52.890 --> 27:54.520
Well,that's not something the general public's

27:54.590 --> 27:56.120
walking around with, is it?

27:56.190 --> 27:57.590
You know, I think it's time

27:57.650 --> 28:00.220
we visit the Kipayo Indian casino.

28:00.290 --> 28:04.050
O'Shay did get Lansing on the Indian Legislative Board.

28:26.220 --> 28:28.520
You know,this place is actually,uh...

28:28.590 --> 28:30.920
it's kind of hip.

28:30.990 --> 28:32.850
There's a lot of money that flows in and out of here.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.390
I would expect nothing less.

28:34.450 --> 28:35.790
I think the office is this way.

28:41.190 --> 28:42.990
Mr. and Mrs. Veston?

28:43.050 --> 28:45.350
Hi. We're from the Miami-Dade Crime Lab.

28:45.420 --> 28:49.090
We're surprised to find CSI out here on our land.

28:49.150 --> 28:50.420
We're investigating a murder

28:50.490 --> 28:51.750
that occurred early this morning.

28:51.820 --> 28:56.090
Specifically with an antique knife.

28:56.150 --> 28:58.550
Someone kills with an antique knife,

28:58.620 --> 29:00.490
and you immediately come to us?

29:00.550 --> 29:03.750
Do you go to the Russians if it's an AK-47?

29:03.820 --> 29:06.290
This is not a racial issue, Mrs. Veston.

29:06.350 --> 29:09.390
The person who was murdered had financial ties to your casino.

29:09.450 --> 29:11.190
Doug Lansing.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.920
Doug was one of our first non-Indian investors.

29:13.990 --> 29:15.790
He was a board member.

29:15.850 --> 29:17.990
More like a financial godfather.

29:18.050 --> 29:20.520
Someone we learned to hate.

29:20.590 --> 29:22.190
That's a pretty strong word.

29:22.250 --> 29:23.790
Lansing and his partners

29:23.850 --> 29:25.520
changed the meaning of our tribal agreements.

29:25.590 --> 29:28.090
Regulating your people right out of their own money.

29:28.150 --> 29:31.290
And Lansing walked away with the rest of it.

29:31.350 --> 29:33.820
He and O'Shay. Scott O'Shay

29:33.890 --> 29:35.320
won't show his face around here.

29:35.390 --> 29:37.590
He knows better.

29:37.650 --> 29:40.420
This money was earmarked for schools and healthcare.

29:40.490 --> 29:42.090
If it wasn't for Reggie,

29:42.150 --> 29:44.120
none of this revenue would flow back to the people.

29:44.190 --> 29:46.250
So every person on this reservation

29:46.320 --> 29:48.750
has motive to kill Lansing.

29:48.820 --> 29:52.020
Looks that way.

29:59.390 --> 30:02.150
I just spoke to Karl Bennett,Anna.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.750
So you know.

30:06.820 --> 30:09.090
I know about your son.

30:15.690 --> 30:17.850
Why don't you tell me about him?

30:22.020 --> 30:24.120
He's almost three.

30:24.190 --> 30:27.020
It just happened.

30:27.790 --> 30:30.390
I wanted to keep him.

30:30.450 --> 30:35.050
For a while, I was doing pretty good,but...

30:35.120 --> 30:37.250
Anna,if you don't tell me everything,

30:37.320 --> 30:38.820
I can't help you.

30:43.420 --> 30:46.850
His father has some money,

30:46.920 --> 30:50.490
but I want to give my son everything he needs.

30:50.550 --> 30:52.620
And O'Shay offered to help.

30:52.690 --> 30:55.190
Help how?

30:55.250 --> 30:59.520
He makes sure money goes to my son every month.

30:59.590 --> 31:01.090
Okay,explain that to me.

31:01.150 --> 31:04.220
How does it work?

31:04.290 --> 31:05.890
Passing casino payoffs.

31:05.950 --> 31:09.820
I do it for my son.

31:09.890 --> 31:13.750
Okay. What's next?

31:13.820 --> 31:16.050
O'Shay had his sights on Reggie Veston.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.590
He was always asking me for that black book.

31:18.650 --> 31:21.920
Which explains why he had it stolen from you.

31:21.990 --> 31:25.420
He's blackmailing Veston.

31:25.490 --> 31:27.120
And now that I have the information,

31:27.190 --> 31:28.690
he's going to go direct to Veston.

31:31.650 --> 31:35.050
(siren wailing)

31:38.350 --> 31:40.750
Miami-Dade PD!

31:40.820 --> 31:44.020

31:47.720 --> 31:49.220
Clear.

32:20.120 --> 32:23.090
You're not leaving any stone unturned,are you,Lieutenant?

32:23.150 --> 32:25.290
You're making my associates very uncomfortable.

32:25.350 --> 32:26.520
Yes,with Doug Lansing

32:26.590 --> 32:28.090
out of the way you're going to need

32:28.150 --> 32:29.850
a new front man for your casino investments.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.590
Casinos?

32:32.150 --> 32:34.350
Now that would be unethical for a man in my position.

32:34.420 --> 32:37.020
Which is why you were blackmailing Reggie Veston.

32:37.090 --> 32:38.390
That's a hefty accusation.

32:38.450 --> 32:40.150
I got another news flash for you.

32:40.220 --> 32:41.520
We found him dead

32:41.590 --> 32:43.520

32:43.590 --> 32:44.550
You're kidding?

32:44.620 --> 32:46.520
No,and by the looks of him,

32:46.590 --> 32:48.650
he wasn't easily persuadable, was he?

32:48.720 --> 32:51.590
I wasn't persuading anyone.

32:51.650 --> 32:54.550
I know you had Tess' black book stolen.

32:54.620 --> 32:57.720
Can you really prove it was me?

32:57.790 --> 32:59.490
Anna can.

32:59.550 --> 33:00.820
You won't have her in court.

33:00.890 --> 33:02.120
She won't testify.
