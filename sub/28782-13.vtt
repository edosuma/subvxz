<i> Previously on</i> Queen Sugar...

00:03.304 --> 00:04.670
Why I gotta worry about enemies

00:04.672 --> 00:06.538
when I got a sister like
Nova Bordelon right here.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.441
I'm angry at her, too,
but I know that she loves Blue.

00:09.443 --> 00:12.244

Connected to Old World Energy.

00:14.682 --> 00:15.781
Who are these people?

00:15.783 --> 00:17.149
They want to ask you
some questions

00:17.151 --> 00:18.450
about the Queen Sugar fire.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.886
<i> And it ain't</i>
<i> about looking back.</i>

00:20.888 --> 00:22.721
About breaking bad cycles.

00:22.723 --> 00:23.956
<i> Looking forward.</i>

00:23.958 --> 00:25.224
Mom, I'm not going to Harvard.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.326
You have been dealt
a winning hand.

00:27.328 --> 00:30.496
You just want to toss it away?
How dare you.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.205
Got one of those for me?

00:52.319 --> 00:54.053
-I'm sorry.
-You should've--

01:00.461 --> 01:04.096
I'm sorry for how I told you
about Harvard.

01:05.466 --> 01:08.467
I-- I shouldn't have
sprung it on you like that.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.238
I appreciate that.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.308
And my response...

01:17.545 --> 01:19.411
it wasn't just
about Harvard.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.714
This election...

01:23.751 --> 01:26.518
I just want you to have
every chance,

01:26.520 --> 01:29.154
every advantage.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.356
I already have advantages.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.793
And I'm thankful for them.
I...

01:34.795 --> 01:38.363
I want to use my advantages
to help others.

01:41.168 --> 01:42.835
I want you to help others.

01:45.306 --> 01:48.407
But I'm going to need
some time with this.

01:48.409 --> 01:51.543
I'm sorry if that's not
what you want to hear right now.

02:04.058 --> 02:05.557
[pounding on door]

02:11.599 --> 02:14.233
Miss Charley Bordelon, we have
a warrant for your arrest.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.568
-What?
-The fire at Queen Sugar Mill.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.103
You're under arrest
for arson

02:18.105 --> 02:19.805

02:54.808 --> 02:57.276
How long they trying to make us
wait till we get word?

02:58.412 --> 02:59.845
Because I know
they not trying

02:59.847 --> 03:01.647
to keep my sister overnight
on this bullshit.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.348
-Ralph Angel...
-That ain't happening.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.017
Sir. Language.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.552
Sir. Racism.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.454
Ralph Angel, sit down now.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.392
I got no time to be polite,
Aunt Vi.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.027
Now, we know what this is.

03:15.029 --> 03:18.497
What they doing to us.
What they've been doing to us.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.832
They trying to break us.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.169
Who called all them reporters
out front anyway?

03:24.171 --> 03:25.771
Rah, please.
Micah's on the phone

03:25.773 --> 03:27.472
getting an update
from Charley's lawyers--

03:27.474 --> 03:29.208
Nobody was talking to you,
Nova.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.876
Ralph Angel, stop it.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.811

03:38.919 --> 03:40.085
I'm okay.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.453
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.255
-I'm okay.
-Are they letting you go?

03:43.257 --> 03:44.690
It's a fixed bail.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.959
And my lawyer
will have this foolishness

03:46.961 --> 03:48.794
tossed within 24 hours.

03:48.796 --> 03:52.664
They have nothing,
and they know it.

[whispering]
You see that?

04:01.609 --> 04:03.609
That's what I don't like.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.983
Charley, there's reporters
outside.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.251
[sighs]

04:12.253 --> 04:14.386
How do you want
to handle this?

04:18.025 --> 04:20.025
Aunt Vi,
do you have a compact?

04:20.027 --> 04:21.893
Absolutely.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.533
-[camera shutters clicking]
-[reporters shouting]

04:30.137 --> 04:31.370
Is it true
you're under suspicion

04:31.372 --> 04:32.604
of setting your own mill
on fire?

04:32.606 --> 04:35.040
That's speculative
stupidity.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.609
I stand before you now

04:37.611 --> 04:40.646
because there is no substance
to this arrest,

04:40.648 --> 04:44.149
and the warrant was sought after
by Sheriff Guidry,

04:44.151 --> 04:48.420
who has three open cases
of corruption against him.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.523
Their only so-called
evidence

04:51.525 --> 04:53.325
is a drip torch
with my prints

04:53.327 --> 04:54.693
that was found
at the scene.

04:54.695 --> 04:57.863
But, of course,
a drip torch is a common tool

04:57.865 --> 05:00.832
owned by most farmers
and sugar mills.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.567
My lawyer didn't even
have to fly in

05:02.569 --> 05:04.036
to cast doubt
on this charade.

05:04.038 --> 05:05.504
You're saying
you're innocent?

05:05.506 --> 05:07.472
You're damn right I'm innocent.

05:09.276 --> 05:15.547
To whomever is fueling these
attacks on me and my family,

05:15.549 --> 05:19.518
to whomever tried and failed

05:19.520 --> 05:22.020
to permanently purge
our supporters

05:22.022 --> 05:23.221
from the voter rolls,

05:23.223 --> 05:25.524
it won't work.

05:25.526 --> 05:29.294
When you come for me
and the people of St. Jo,

05:29.296 --> 05:31.563
you better not miss.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.733
And you missed.

05:36.136 --> 05:38.170
We'll see you at the polls.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.672
-[camera shutters clicking]
-[reporters shouting]

05:57.424 --> 06:00.092
I thought I called in
the favor you owe me.

06:00.094 --> 06:01.793
You did.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.595
Well, then why did I
just have--?

06:03.597 --> 06:06.465
Have to see Charley
get arrested?

06:06.467 --> 06:08.467
I'm aware.

06:08.469 --> 06:11.002
I wish it didn't have
to get that far,

06:11.004 --> 06:14.439
but I had to let it
play out a bit further.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.608
A bit?

06:16.610 --> 06:19.144
All right,
a lot further.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.613
To be sure
it was airtight.

06:22.816 --> 06:23.949
And it is.

06:24.952 --> 06:28.086
Everything you need
on Frances.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.137
My God.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.441
I'd say thank you,
but you owe me.

06:49.443 --> 06:52.577
Did owe you.

06:55.349 --> 06:57.783
Have you heard
from Betty recently?

06:59.386 --> 07:01.686
Baby.

07:01.688 --> 07:04.423
We lost contact years ago.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.625
Last I heard she had retired.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.494
Your little girl
graduated Spelman.

07:09.496 --> 07:13.031
And then Wharton,
I think.

07:17.304 --> 07:20.605
That was 10,
15 years ago.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.943
Maybe in a different time

07:24.945 --> 07:27.512
we could have all
stayed together.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.118
Your daddy would have
killed you.

07:34.188 --> 07:35.587
He almost did.

07:35.589 --> 07:38.356
If it wasn't for you
getting her out of town,

07:38.358 --> 07:41.359
convincing him the whole thing
was just a rumor,

07:41.361 --> 07:43.762
I might be six feet under.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.501
I ain't singing no sad song
for you, Sam.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.869
You grown.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.805
You could've at least
stayed in touch.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.006
No.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.843
If Frances had ever
gotten wind of that,

07:57.845 --> 08:01.112
she'd have sold me out quicker
than God could get the news.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.916
And Daddy would've
cut me off.

08:07.120 --> 08:11.289
Yeah, it's always
about money with you, Sam.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.724
Back then?

08:13.894 --> 08:16.094
When I was making my bones,
my name?

08:16.096 --> 08:17.829
Yeah.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.800
But by the time
I knew better,

08:21.802 --> 08:26.538
it didn't make sense
to disturb their life

08:26.540 --> 08:29.140
after all those years.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.009
Well, you know better now?

08:32.112 --> 08:33.712
Do better now.

08:33.714 --> 08:37.048
Maybe I will one day.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.953
Sure you will, Sam.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.188
Bye.

08:45.259 --> 08:46.758

[Charley] Can you e-mail me
a copy of the affidavit

08:48.896 --> 08:51.796
when the charges are officially
dropped in the morning?

08:51.798 --> 08:53.298
Yeah. Thanks, Olivia.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.202

08:58.438 --> 08:59.671
How are you holding up,
baby girl?

08:59.673 --> 09:02.974
I am...staying focused.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.175
Some tea, Aunt Vi?

09:04.177 --> 09:05.944
I'm too upset for tea.

[clears throat]

09:07.180 --> 09:08.280
Thank you.

09:08.282 --> 09:09.981
Like the fire
wasn't bad enough,

09:09.983 --> 09:11.950
to try to say you the one
that set it

09:11.952 --> 09:13.151
is a sick joke.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.487
Well, I'm sure Frances
had a good laugh,

09:15.489 --> 09:17.656
having me carted off
by the cops.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.658
Well, you know...

09:19.660 --> 09:21.860
she ain't gonna have
the last laugh.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.296
What is all this, Aunt Vi?

09:24.298 --> 09:25.931
Information.

09:25.933 --> 09:29.200
The most valuable thing you can
have at a time like this.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.076
Well, these are...

09:39.179 --> 09:41.513
these are financial books

09:41.515 --> 09:42.881
for Landry Enterprises,

09:42.883 --> 09:44.649
but not the ones
I've seen.

09:47.321 --> 09:49.788
There are people who are listed
here who are getting payments

09:49.790 --> 09:51.156
that I've never even heard of.

09:52.492 --> 09:53.992
Except Hank Miller.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.629
He's in here a few times,

09:57.631 --> 10:01.132
listed next to some
very large payments.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.101
I've got bank transactions
from an offshore account

10:03.103 --> 10:06.104
that I'm guessing
match those payments.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.840
Aunt Vi, where did you
get all this?

10:08.842 --> 10:11.209
[Violet]
Don't be worried about all that.

10:11.211 --> 10:15.947
Y'all forget sometimes,
I got history on my side.

10:15.949 --> 10:19.284

this is something.

E-mails from Frances's
home server

between her
and Hank Miller

10:36.503 --> 10:39.671
discussing the ICE raid...

10:41.675 --> 10:43.108
They talked about the method

10:43.110 --> 10:46.778
most likely to flag
the insurance company.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.480
Unbelievable.

10:48.482 --> 10:53.284
This...this is exactly what
we need to take Frances down.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.753
Almost.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.921
Remember, there are bigger
forces out there.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.323
We have a lot here,

10:58.325 --> 11:00.091
but we don't have
everything.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.428
Well, then you just
keep looking.

Oh, just for you, baby,
and only for you.

Hey, look...
all right, now.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.715
There, you have a taste.
Just one taste, all right?

11:23.717 --> 11:25.583
Okay, um...

11:25.585 --> 11:26.785
Oh, that...

11:26.787 --> 11:28.953
See, I got gifts, baby.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.691
Oh, my God. Mm!

11:32.693 --> 11:34.192
That's talent.

[both laugh]

11:36.596 --> 11:37.796
That's good.

Okay, I am not the only one

11:41.234 --> 11:43.301

It's official.

Mwah!

11:46.440 --> 11:47.972
Thank you, my baby.

11:47.974 --> 11:52.010
Mm. Hey, have you thought
any more

11:52.012 --> 11:54.245
about opening
that men's lounge?

11:54.247 --> 11:56.414
You could make it
a wing spot, too.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.950
I thought about it.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.885
What you think?
You think it's a good idea?

12:00.887 --> 12:03.421
I just want you to be happy,
baby.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.589
Whatever.

Oh, I knew. I knew you were
going to take it too far.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.226
[whispers]
I got a surprise for you later.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.294
[Blue, whispering]
You do? Awesome.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.897
-Mm, they smell delicious.
-[laughs]

12:45.899 --> 12:47.932
Okay. Just wait.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.236
-How you doing?
-Good.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.670
Thanks for asking.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.372
It's all good.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.809
Um, I thought that

12:57.811 --> 12:59.878
after we talked to Blue
about your father...

13:01.081 --> 13:02.313
I'd cook you a meal today.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.649
I know a lot's
been going on,

13:04.651 --> 13:08.520
but I wanted to say
a proper thank-you.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.823
The groceries
are in the trunk.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.759
[Ralph Angel]
What I do know

13:14.761 --> 13:16.027
is you better not
be peeking.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.462
-Got them eyes closed?
-Yup.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.998
[Ralph Angel]
You can open them now. Come on.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.969
-Ah!
-[Ralph Angel laughs]

13:26.406 --> 13:28.907
It's not my birthday.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.042
-[chuckles]
-Right?

13:31.044 --> 13:33.178
It's from your birthday
a little while ago.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.213
Found them while we was
spring cleaning.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.081
Hmm. Wow.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.917
That's from Papa.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.121
What do you mean
it's from Papa?

13:44.891 --> 13:47.992
Remember that birthday party
you were at?

13:47.994 --> 13:49.894
Didn't get to open
all your gifts.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.631
They've been up in the closet
and I forgot.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.067
This box is from Papa.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.770
He just wasn't able
to give it to you yet.

13:58.772 --> 14:01.406
Because he got sick.

14:02.576 --> 14:04.275
Yeah, because he got sick.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.878
You want to see
what's inside the box?

14:08.114 --> 14:10.448
I think you should
open it.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.583
Okay.

14:15.422 --> 14:16.588
[gasps]

14:16.590 --> 14:17.922
Ah.

14:17.924 --> 14:22.427
Blue, you are going to want
to see this.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.629
A beach ball?

14:24.631 --> 14:25.864
[Ralph Angel]
Ha-ha!

14:25.866 --> 14:28.266
Your father knew
you liked water.

14:40.447 --> 14:41.946
Papa...

14:50.123 --> 14:53.424
Come on. It's okay.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.230
Papa. I miss you, Papa.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.267
I got you,
buddy.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.639
Gonna be alright.

15:07.641 --> 15:12.477
[R&B music playing]

15:12.479 --> 15:14.078
Place really works.

15:15.649 --> 15:18.917
Space big enough for both of us
to have an office.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.589
Alarm, laundry room,
two parking spots.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.757
Two?

15:25.759 --> 15:27.225
Two.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.894
It's close to my kids

15:29.896 --> 15:31.462
and close
to the 9th Ward.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.667
[clears throat]

15:35.669 --> 15:36.901
I love it.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.569
[laughs]

15:38.571 --> 15:40.672
It feels like us.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.073
[laughs]

15:50.884 --> 15:53.251
Wherever we are
is where home is.

15:55.755 --> 15:56.955
You said that.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.323
And I meant it.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.693
I mean it.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.700
[sighs]

16:10.136 --> 16:11.669
I have to admit...

16:13.106 --> 16:15.239
I am a little bit nervous...

16:16.743 --> 16:18.609
about today.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.144
Oh.

16:21.915 --> 16:23.348
You?

16:24.718 --> 16:30.021
I don't think "nervous"
is the word for me.

16:30.924 --> 16:33.524
Anxious.

16:33.526 --> 16:34.926
Maybe eager.

16:34.928 --> 16:36.127
[laughs]

16:36.129 --> 16:38.363
Excited, even.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.498
I want this part to be over

16:40.500 --> 16:44.369
so we can get
to the good part.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.006
I want my family...

16:49.609 --> 16:51.442
to know you.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.445
And when they do...

16:56.983 --> 16:59.484
they'll see what I see.

17:08.762 --> 17:10.428
Those are all the groceries.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.763
[sighs]

17:20.407 --> 17:22.106
I was hoping
we could talk.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.046
[sighs]

17:35.255 --> 17:37.488
We told each other that...

17:38.658 --> 17:40.691
we never stopped
loving each other.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.327
The night of the storm.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.631
And then Blue called
from Deesha's,

17:46.633 --> 17:51.602
and we never really finished
that conversation.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.842
I'd like to finish it.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.678
Me too.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.748
I just want you to know that...

18:05.452 --> 18:07.318
I know you always
meant well.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.354
All the things that happened...

18:12.292 --> 18:15.827
it was never coming
from a bad place inside you,

18:15.829 --> 18:18.429
but just a hurt place.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.534
A lot of that hurt
is my fault.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.803
And I'm sorry for it.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.372
I appreciate that.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.109
I do.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.479
But I have to be accountable
for my actions.

18:34.481 --> 18:39.217
You can be accountable
and still good to yourself.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.786
You've been through a lot,
darling.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.591
Your addiction.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.128
An assault.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.198
I mean, you was violated...

18:55.568 --> 18:57.235
in the worst way.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.140
But...

19:03.510 --> 19:06.377
I don't want you to see me
as all those things.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.448
I don't want to be that.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.154
I want you to look at me
like you used to.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.226
I don't think I can.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.233
The woman I see now...

19:31.237 --> 19:32.703
is more brave...

19:35.341 --> 19:36.874
more beautiful...

19:36.876 --> 19:39.243
[R&B music playing]

19:39.245 --> 19:42.480
and better than
I ever seen.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.782
I see you, Darla.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.185
All of you.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.188
I love all of you.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.058
I love you.

19:54.060 --> 19:57.562
[music continues]

19:57.564 --> 19:59.497
Come here.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.653
[whispering]
I love you so much, Ralph Angel.

20:24.157 --> 20:25.690
I love you, too.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.562
[both laugh]

20:33.967 --> 20:35.499
Always.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.541
[Violet] Charley, you don't need
to be here working.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.543
Go and focus
on your big night.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.511
The votes are already in,

20:47.513 --> 20:49.013
and every exit poll
is saying

20:49.015 --> 20:51.015
that it's just going to be
too close to call

20:51.017 --> 20:52.450
until last votes
are counted.

20:52.452 --> 20:56.053
So I just need to keep my hands
and my mind busy.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.488
I got you.

This is Calvin.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.976
Pleasure, Calvin.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.378
I've read so much...

21:22.248 --> 21:24.548
I've heard so much
about you, baby.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.384
Thank you, ma'am.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.452
I've heard many beautiful things
about you.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.454
It's an honor to finally
meet you in person.

21:33.326 --> 21:36.160
Well, I'm going
to excuse myself.

21:36.162 --> 21:37.928
This is my sister, Charley.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.467
Best of luck tonight.

21:43.469 --> 21:46.137
Thank you.
I will take that.

21:46.139 --> 21:47.571
Welcome.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.012
How are you doing?

21:55.014 --> 21:56.514
Good. Thanks.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.917
I heard about your new
college plans.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.052
Congratulations.

22:02.955 --> 22:04.922
You're stronger than I ever was
at your age.

22:09.329 --> 22:10.695
Thank you.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.964
You know, I just hope
it all works out.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.333
Oh, it will.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.901
You're going to make it so.

[door opening]

So there is so much to do
before those doors open,

22:26.679 --> 22:29.480
Why don't y'all
make yourselves useful.

22:29.482 --> 22:32.183
And go on in there

22:32.185 --> 22:34.552

But did she let that stop her?
No.

She did what she had to do
and she fought back.

Hmm.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.855
Despite your best efforts.

25:59.392 --> 26:02.893
Truthfully, I never felt
Jacob's heart

to be loyal

there may be more resources
available to you.

your mill.

26:51.577 --> 26:53.210
Whoo.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.812
Not even sworn in,

26:54.814 --> 26:57.581
and I'm already being offered
a bribe.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.118
And by a dead woman walking.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.753
Excuse me?

27:02.755 --> 27:05.255
I'm talking about the payments
you made to Hank Miller.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.591
And the payments he made
to two young men.

27:07.593 --> 27:11.996
Poor and desperate men
like Joaquin Avila.

27:13.499 --> 27:17.635
The men who subsequently
set fire to my mill.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.403
I know about it all, Frances.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.605
That's ridiculous.

27:21.607 --> 27:23.707
Well, the two men
have already confessed.

27:23.709 --> 27:27.011
The police picked up Hank Miller
this morning,

27:27.013 --> 27:29.847
so I imagine it won't be long
before he does the same.

27:29.849 --> 27:34.318
But if you have a simple
explanation,

27:34.320 --> 27:36.987
I'm sure they'd love
to hear it.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.889
Frances Ann Boudreaux...

27:40.960 --> 27:43.994
you're under arrest for bribery
and conspiracy to commit arson.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.162
Please stand up.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.698
This is ridiculous.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.767
I want to speak
to your superior.

27:49.769 --> 27:52.436
We'll talk about that
at the station.

27:55.941 --> 27:58.776
Don't you dare
put those things on me,

27:58.778 --> 28:01.445
if you know
what's good for you.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.897
[chimes]

28:36.082 --> 28:38.182
What you doing here, Nova?

28:38.184 --> 28:40.551
Thought I told you
to stay away from here.

28:43.489 --> 28:44.855
I'm here to apologize.

28:45.991 --> 28:47.558
Please.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.827
Please let me apologize.

28:52.631 --> 28:55.866
Rah, Mama's buried here.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.468
On the land.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.138
-No, she ain't.
-She was never cremated

29:01.140 --> 29:03.207
like we were told.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.876
She was buried here instead.

29:09.014 --> 29:10.514
Nah.

29:11.517 --> 29:14.184
Pop would have told us.

29:14.186 --> 29:17.421
I went to see Mama's cousin,
Martha, by the wetlands.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.157
She said Mama had Daddy bury her
by the farm.

29:20.159 --> 29:23.293
It was kept a secret
because it was her gift to him,

29:23.295 --> 29:26.597
so she would always
be close to him.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.200
I ain't never heard
of no cousin Martha.

29:33.739 --> 29:35.606
She had Mama's journal.

29:38.043 --> 29:39.977
All in her handwriting.

29:54.527 --> 29:56.894
You asked me to stay away
from the farm.

30:01.267 --> 30:02.933
This is why
I can't do it.

30:04.937 --> 30:08.539
I know it's a lot
to take in,

30:08.541 --> 30:10.974
but Mama didn't want us
to know.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.745
So we wouldn't feel tied
to this place.

30:14.747 --> 30:18.582
It was just supposed to be
between her and Daddy.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.751
There's not even
a grave marker.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.670
What is it?

30:39.672 --> 30:41.839
"Angel cream."

30:41.841 --> 30:44.541
I remember
the angel cream.

30:44.543 --> 30:47.144
She used to make that
when I got scratched up.

30:49.748 --> 30:52.716
She said God made it
just for me.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.119
See what she wrote
below it?

31:05.431 --> 31:07.264
[sighs]

31:08.834 --> 31:12.002
"Nova applied the angel cream
last night.

31:13.505 --> 31:16.073
"She's so gentle
with Ralph Angel.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.743
"So fiercely protective.

31:19.745 --> 31:24.982
"And he follows her every move
in awe and adoration.

31:28.120 --> 31:32.689
"My greatest prayer
is that their bond never severs,

31:32.691 --> 31:36.660
but only deepens with time."

31:39.632 --> 31:41.198
Mama would have
hated this.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.534
Daddy too.

31:44.536 --> 31:47.504
I think that's why
she's been reaching out to me.

31:47.506 --> 31:50.274
This farm isn't just land.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.808
It's...

31:51.810 --> 31:54.478
consecrated ground.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.914
For her.

31:57.983 --> 31:59.182
And for us.

32:02.888 --> 32:05.055
I know you can't
just forgive me.

32:06.392 --> 32:09.626
And I'm sorry I went about
things the way I did.

32:09.628 --> 32:12.863
But something good
came from all of this.

32:14.199 --> 32:16.633
Let me work at this.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.102
At us.

32:23.876 --> 32:26.076
I want to fix things.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.680
Re-earn your trust.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.984
But you got to let me in.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.752
If we're going
to fight these people

32:35.754 --> 32:38.055
who hate everything
we stand for...

32:40.826 --> 32:43.360
we can't be at war
with each other.

32:50.102 --> 32:53.637
I remember Mama used
to grow these in her garden.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.974
[Nova]
Imphepho plants.

32:56.976 --> 32:59.376
She used them to make
your angel cream.

32:59.378 --> 33:00.877
She used them in everything.

33:00.879 --> 33:03.347
Been seeing them around
sometimes.

33:04.416 --> 33:05.615
Here on the farm?

33:05.617 --> 33:07.184
They ain't here now.

33:07.186 --> 33:10.320
Except this one spot.
Growing wild.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.656
Where, exactly?

33:12.658 --> 33:14.191
I don't remember.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.996
I was out in the fields
playing with Blue.

33:20.265 --> 33:22.399
Rah, Martha said
she couldn't exactly say

33:22.401 --> 33:23.834
where Mama was buried.

33:23.836 --> 33:25.402
But if a bunch
of her favorite flowers

33:25.404 --> 33:27.437
are somewhere
in that cane,

33:27.439 --> 33:29.706
maybe that's where.

33:29.708 --> 33:32.676
That's 800 acres,
though.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.511
That's okay.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.747
I got an idea
on how we can find it.

33:40.386 --> 33:41.752
[sighs]

33:49.061 --> 33:51.395
Parker's waiting for you.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.864
-Right in there, Miss Bordelon.
-Thank you.

34:05.511 --> 34:07.210
[door closes]

34:07.212 --> 34:08.912
So.

34:08.914 --> 34:13.750
I finally get to meet
the elusive Parker Campbell.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.090
I'll be with you
in a moment.

34:20.092 --> 34:22.259
Thanks, John.
I'll take it from here.

34:22.261 --> 34:23.827
[man]
Of course, Miss Campbell.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.762
I'll be outside
if you need me.

34:30.536 --> 34:33.437
[door opens and closes]

34:33.439 --> 34:34.938
I'm Parker.

34:34.940 --> 34:37.274
I run Community Relations
at the Beckington Group,

34:37.276 --> 34:40.077
which is just a fancy
and intentionally vague way

34:40.079 --> 34:43.213
of saying I make things happen
around here.

34:43.215 --> 34:48.218
I advise our lobbying group
on where to invest and when.

34:48.220 --> 34:51.088
I smooth things over
in communities such as St. Jo's

34:51.090 --> 34:54.524
when they give us more
resistance than we anticipated.

34:54.526 --> 34:56.059
So you're a lobbyist.

34:56.061 --> 34:58.995
Some kind of henchwoman
who basically sold her soul

34:58.997 --> 35:01.264
to work for the Koch Brothers.
I got it.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.766
Sold my soul?

35:02.768 --> 35:04.334
All that?

35:05.871 --> 35:07.938
I'm a businesswoman

35:07.940 --> 35:09.473
who lobbies on the side
of whoever's winning.

35:09.475 --> 35:13.944
And right now,
that isn't you or St. Jo's.

35:13.946 --> 35:17.647
But you and your family
have caused us some problems.

35:17.649 --> 35:21.118
Frances is our mainline
into the St. Jo community.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.619
Was.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.488
She's going to jail.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.356
We'll see.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.560
But she clearly
underestimated you.

35:30.562 --> 35:33.029
I won't make that same mistake.

35:33.031 --> 35:34.965
We still got our highway.

35:34.967 --> 35:36.967
But you didn't get
your councilman.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.138
I defeated Jacob Boudreaux.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.406
Which is why
I called you here.

35:43.408 --> 35:46.610
To ask that you cooperate
with us.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.512
Us?

35:50.249 --> 35:52.916
John, please send
my father in.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.431
It's good to see you,
Charley.

36:09.668 --> 36:10.867
What on earth?

36:10.869 --> 36:12.702
Thanks for your help
on Frances.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.571
I knew she'd overstep.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.006
And her reaction to you

36:16.008 --> 36:18.742
confirmed that I made the right
decision years ago

36:18.744 --> 36:21.111
for keeping Parker
away from St. Jo.

36:21.113 --> 36:25.448
And it was best to let another
woman take on Frances anyway.

36:25.450 --> 36:27.017
Appearances and whatnot.

36:29.955 --> 36:31.254
[Parker]
As I was saying,

36:31.256 --> 36:33.390
I'd appreciate
your cooperation

36:33.392 --> 36:35.458
as we bring the highway
into St. Jo

36:35.460 --> 36:38.361
and ready the community
for fracking.

36:42.134 --> 36:45.068
This is all very cute.

36:45.070 --> 36:48.972
But since I was elected
to stop the highway,

36:48.974 --> 36:52.742
you both know this is
a waste of time.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.611
Then I will take your land.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.313
In fact,

36:56.315 --> 36:58.815
the Beckington Group has already
sent a letter of intent

36:58.817 --> 37:01.251
to condemn and possess the farm

37:01.253 --> 37:03.620
belonging to
Ralph Angel Bordelon.

37:03.622 --> 37:05.555
It'll never happen.

37:09.494 --> 37:11.828
You don't know me.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.964
And you don't know me.

37:18.437 --> 37:22.005
[Nova] When I interviewed you
for my article about Daddy,

37:22.007 --> 37:24.040
and we talked about
Daddy's depression,

37:24.042 --> 37:25.875
you said he would call you
sometimes.

37:25.877 --> 37:28.311
Yeah, when he was feeling down.

37:28.313 --> 37:31.081
Yeah, he'd call late at night.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.716
He just wanted a friend
to talk to,

37:32.718 --> 37:36.286
so we'd walk the cane fields
and he'd talk.

37:36.288 --> 37:39.456
Would you meet here
by the house?

37:39.458 --> 37:42.225
Or would you meet
somewhere in the fields?

37:44.529 --> 37:45.695
Both, I guess.

37:45.697 --> 37:47.964
Sometimes here
and sometimes out in the field.

37:50.602 --> 37:51.935
Okay.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.372
What's this about, Nova?

37:55.374 --> 37:57.507
You said that sometimes
when you would come over,

37:57.509 --> 37:59.876
you saw him
talking to himself?

37:59.878 --> 38:01.678
Yeah, but that wasn't what--

38:01.680 --> 38:04.547
I don't think he was
talking to himself, Mr. Prosper.

38:05.817 --> 38:07.317
We think he was, uh...

38:09.221 --> 38:11.221
talking to our mama.

38:11.223 --> 38:13.923
She out there somewhere.

38:13.925 --> 38:16.259
Buried on our land.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.533
Tru's buried on the land?

38:25.337 --> 38:29.639
Was there an area
that he liked to walk with you?

38:31.543 --> 38:32.976
More than others?

38:38.183 --> 38:40.283
Come to think of it, yeah.

38:49.328 --> 38:51.928
[typing]

38:51.930 --> 38:56.299
[Nova]<i> My father and</i>
