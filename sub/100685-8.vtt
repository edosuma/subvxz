WEBVTT

00:18.227 --> 00:20.062
-(metal detector beeps)
-Sir.

00:20.104 --> 00:21.731
Sir, step over to me please.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.775
(quiet chatter)

00:33.325 --> 00:34.702
(handheld metal detector
trilling)

00:34.744 --> 00:36.620
(elevator bell dings)

00:48.215 --> 00:49.592
(elevator bell dings)

00:49.633 --> 00:51.844
(quiet chatter)

00:51.886 --> 00:53.512
Yeah, right there on the belt.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.684
Your boss says
Chandler's chances

00:58.726 --> 01:00.936
of getting the tape tossed
are slim to none.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.856
I'd say closer to none,
but it's the judge's call.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.483
If she succeeds?

01:05.524 --> 01:08.068
We've got the wiretaps,
spy cam footage.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.029
We'll be fine.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.198
Hey, Mads.
I thought you weren't coming.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.449
Changed my mind.

01:13.491 --> 01:15.451
I want to see Chandler
in action.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.748
(talking quietly)

01:38.682 --> 01:40.559
What's she doing here?

01:44.146 --> 01:46.148
Let's find out.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.366
Thought you didn't believe
in our legal system.

01:55.407 --> 01:59.745
That woman
and her FBI lover boy...

01:59.787 --> 02:02.748
they got my husband killed.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.417
Make me a believer, Detective.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.086
Put her away.

02:09.421 --> 02:11.298
You want to check it?

02:11.340 --> 02:12.967
I do.

02:22.184 --> 02:23.352
Should go ahead and take one.

02:23.394 --> 02:25.563
Help you see through
all the bullshit lies

02:25.604 --> 02:27.439
and happy talk.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.316
DEPUTY:
Remain seated and come to order.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.235
Department 107
is now in session.

02:31.277 --> 02:33.612
The Honorable Donna Sobel
presiding.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.156
Show's starting, Detective.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.033
Better go sit
with the other sheep.

02:38.075 --> 02:41.620
Create any sort of disturbance
in here, you're going to jail.

02:44.039 --> 02:47.793
SOBEL:
We're on the record in
People v. Alicia Kent.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.046
Everything okay?

02:51.088 --> 02:52.464
Yeah, it's fine.

02:52.506 --> 02:57.011
Before the court is a motion
to exclude a digital recording

02:57.052 --> 02:59.847
recovered from the belongings of

02:59.889 --> 03:03.601
deceased FBI agent
Clifford Maxwell.

03:04.894 --> 03:06.937
Ms. Chandler,
do you wish to be heard?

03:06.979 --> 03:08.647
Thank you, Your Honor.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.941
The recording was made
surreptitiously,

03:10.983 --> 03:12.818
unbeknownst to my client.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.112
California law is clear.

03:15.154 --> 03:18.782
Both parties must consent to
the recording of a conversation.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.743
And the law enforcement
exception?

03:20.784 --> 03:22.077
Doesn't apply.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.329
The recording was not made

03:23.370 --> 03:25.497
in the course of
an active investigation.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.166
Ms. Blair?

03:27.207 --> 03:31.211
Your Honor, the legislature
did not intend to protect

03:31.253 --> 03:33.631
the confidentiality
of conversations

03:33.672 --> 03:35.716
about conspiracy
to commit murder.

03:35.758 --> 03:39.762
The law is clear:
conspiracy supersedes consent.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.139
I'll take the matter
under advisement.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.933
Anything else from counsel?

03:43.974 --> 03:46.352
Uh, Your Honor,
I have a new motion

03:46.393 --> 03:50.606
to exclude the wiretaps
that were made in this case.

03:50.648 --> 03:53.525
With respect to the court,
it is the defense's position

03:53.567 --> 03:54.985
that the warrant did not meet

03:55.027 --> 03:57.071
the threshold
of probable cause.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.573
Are you saying that
the court was in error

03:59.615 --> 04:01.325
when it approved the wiretap?

04:01.367 --> 04:02.868
CHANDLER:
I'm saying the court was misled

04:02.910 --> 04:06.121
about the evidence
in support of the wiretap

04:06.163 --> 04:08.916
by the lead investigator,
Detective Harry Bosch.

04:08.958 --> 04:11.585
(quietly):
Told her everything we had.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.212
She signed off on it.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.714
Do the People wish to respond?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.800
Your Honor, the People need
an opportunity

04:17.841 --> 04:23.263
to review the defense motion,
and will answer... accordingly.

04:23.305 --> 04:27.101
SOBEL:
Let's set a future hearing date
for argument on this issue.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.144

files on this bad boy.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.221
That's great work, Klein.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.682
You look at any of this?

05:48.724 --> 05:50.350
Yeah, I watched a couple.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.269
You think one of those johns
is your killer?

05:52.311 --> 05:53.937
Wouldn't surprise me.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.856
Bunch of sad sack losers
and creeps,

05:55.898 --> 05:57.608
but killer, I don't know.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.277
That's the thing about killers.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.321
You don't know.
Could be anyone.

06:03.614 --> 06:06.075
-Thanks.
-Yeah, sure.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.039
Lisa Hammond's been undercover
last two weeks.

06:12.081 --> 06:13.332
Two weeks on the bricks.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.668
-God bless her.
-Mm. Better her than us.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.379
She's identified our dealer.
Drives a blue Impala.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.423
Re-ups most mornings
around 10:00.

06:21.465 --> 06:24.927
As soon as he shows, we drop
the hammer and take him down.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.261
You don't need us for that.

06:26.303 --> 06:29.056
No. Shepherd and Morgan
will assist with the arrest.

06:29.098 --> 06:31.350
-Copy, Sarge.
-BARREL: Good.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.185
My takedown days are behind me.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.895
-Bum knee.
-Right.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.688
BILLETS:
Without a regular dealer,

06:36.730 --> 06:39.525
we're hoping that the residents
of the camp will disperse.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.402
The goal here is to get these
folks into a better situation.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.154
EDGEWOOD:
And caseworkers will be on site

06:44.196 --> 06:46.240
to help place them
in shelters and temp housing.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.283
Should they so desire.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.452
That's right.
Can't force 'em.

06:50.494 --> 06:53.247
They're just gonna move
around the corner.

06:53.288 --> 06:54.373
Find a new dealer.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.000
CRATE:
Or, more likely, a new dealer

06:57.042 --> 06:59.878
-will find them.
-We're sweeping up sand
on the beach.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.131
It's a process.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.799
Mm-hmm.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.844
-(quiet chatter)
-(phone ringing in distance)

07:14.059 --> 07:15.853
EDGAR:
These videos have audio?

07:15.894 --> 07:18.230
You want to listen?

07:18.272 --> 07:19.773
Not really.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.154
(sighs)

07:25.195 --> 07:27.781
14 years old.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.825
That's what he's paying for.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.130
(taps keyboard)

07:44.381 --> 07:45.924
Mitchell Lewan.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.389
How many more of these
do you have to watch?

07:52.431 --> 07:54.558
Too many.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.602
-(whistling a tune)
-(horn honks in distance)

07:58.854 --> 08:00.480
Got something for me?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.906
(woman coughing nearby)

08:08.947 --> 08:12.159
How you doing?

08:12.201 --> 08:13.911
I'm sick.

08:13.952 --> 08:16.622
Sick as a motherfucker.
I need to get well.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.582
Now.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.083
Re-up on the way.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.378
What'd I tell you?

08:23.420 --> 08:25.047
You just hang on, chicky.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.174
We'll get you fixed up
in a flash.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.471
(Teller and dealer chattering)

08:32.512 --> 08:33.889
Yes, sir.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.516
It's all right.

08:39.895 --> 08:42.022
(tires screeching)

08:42.064 --> 08:43.774
OFFICER:
Stay in the car!

08:45.108 --> 08:46.109
Put your hands up!

08:50.614 --> 08:51.823
(siren whoops)

08:54.618 --> 08:55.869
Stay down.

08:55.911 --> 08:57.412
-Give me your hand.
-(grunting)

08:59.873 --> 09:01.458
Fuck you, bitch!

09:01.500 --> 09:03.168
I got you.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.213
Watch your mouth!

09:06.255 --> 09:08.131
And your head.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.008
Got you a fan, Hammond.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.928
What you gonna do?
I'm irresistible.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.305
Yeah, you're right.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.978
MADDIE:
There are so many
pretrial hearings.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.562
I had no idea.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.690
I know it feels like
nothing's happening,

09:24.731 --> 09:28.318
but every court date brings us
that much closer to trial.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.282
Do you really believe
Alicia Kent is innocent?

09:33.323 --> 09:34.908
It doesn't matter
what I believe.

09:34.950 --> 09:37.452
She pled not guilty.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.121
She maintains her innocence.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.206
I don't know for a fact
she's not.

09:41.248 --> 09:45.043
Everyone deserves presumption
of innocence and a fair trial.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.878
Of course.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.507
Speaking of fair, the county
settled with Dante Crow.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.384
$6.5 million.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.512
I read it in the paper.
Congratulations.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.472
Ah, credit where credit's due.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.349
You're the one who brought
the case to my attention.

09:59.391 --> 10:00.851
You told me where to look.

10:00.892 --> 10:03.770
Not everyone would have
spotted what was missing.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.773
Come work for me again.

10:06.815 --> 10:09.026
Next summer?

10:09.067 --> 10:10.569
I'll think about it.

10:12.070 --> 10:15.032
So glad I ran into you.
Take care, Maddie.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.641
Hi. This is Lieutenant Grace
Billets, Hollywood Station.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.770
I just received notice
of a complaint against me.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.938
Can you tell me who filed it?

10:47.981 --> 10:49.816
Well, what can you tell me?

10:51.860 --> 10:53.862
I'll make myself available.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.131
What the fuck?

11:13.173 --> 11:15.759
"You have been identified
as a witness."

11:17.803 --> 11:19.763
I got one, too.

11:19.805 --> 11:21.223
Misconduct.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.937
Oh, shit.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.856
-This is about Billets.
-You filed a complaint?

11:29.898 --> 11:31.233
(scoffs) Of course not.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.943
Talked to Captain Cooper
about it weeks ago,

11:32.984 --> 11:35.153
told him it was nothing.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.447
Maybe Cooper filed one for you.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.951
(scoffs) Can he do that?
File on my behalf?

11:40.992 --> 11:42.536
He's the captain.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.705
Did you file a complaint?

11:45.747 --> 11:48.166
No.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.668
Not exactly.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.962
You talked to Cooper.

11:53.797 --> 11:56.883
(scoffs) I told you
to stay out of it.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.969
I told you I had no choice.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.804
(chuckles)

12:00.846 --> 12:02.639
I need to talk to Billets.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.683
You can't. Protocol.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.726
(sighs) Fuck protocol.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.899
(knock on door)

12:12.941 --> 12:14.734
You have a minute, Lieutenant?

12:14.776 --> 12:17.112
Sure. Come in.

12:22.576 --> 12:23.994
What's up?

12:25.620 --> 12:27.956
Did you get an e-mail
from I.A. this morning?

12:27.998 --> 12:30.584
As a matter of fact, I did.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.461
I just want you to know
it wasn't me.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.004
I didn't file the complaint.

12:35.630 --> 12:39.176
Oh. Uh, that begs
a couple of questions.

12:39.217 --> 12:42.012
Like, "Why would you?"
and-and, "What for?"

12:42.053 --> 12:45.098
-D-Do you know who did?
-I don't.

12:45.140 --> 12:48.560
I-I told him I had no intention
of lodging a formal complaint.

12:48.602 --> 12:49.561
Him?

12:49.603 --> 12:51.146
Captain Cooper.

12:51.188 --> 12:55.942
All right, so wh-what was
your informal complaint?

12:57.986 --> 13:01.364
You're a warm person.
You care about your people.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.910
I do. I try.

13:04.951 --> 13:08.497
Sometimes I think
you have boundary issues.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.748
Respectfully.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.543
Your style's a little
touchy-feely for me.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.300
I never intended
to make you uncomfortable.

13:20.342 --> 13:22.344
I know. (sighs)

13:22.385 --> 13:25.096
I was venting to my partner.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.515
(sighs)

13:26.556 --> 13:29.226
So Pierce reported it to Cooper.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.478
(sighs)
And I'm pissed about that.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.687
No. He had to.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.690
(sighs)

13:35.732 --> 13:37.526
This could damage us both.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.529
I've been down this road before,
you may have heard.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.822
I don't pay attention to gossip.

13:42.864 --> 13:45.700
-So you have heard.
-Yes, ma'am.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.996
Was that part of
what made you uncomfortable?

13:50.038 --> 13:52.457
No. Not really, no.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.918
You should've come to me first.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.545
(sighs)

13:56.586 --> 13:58.421
I thought I'd put an end to it.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.839
Cooper assured me.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.258
Yeah.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.468
Now you know what that's worth.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.803
(sighs)

14:04.844 --> 14:06.263
Wow.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.851
Harry, check this out.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.939
Yeah?

14:15.981 --> 14:17.399
Our man Lewan.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.902
Couple of domestic abuse calls.

14:22.237 --> 14:25.574
Split with his wife nine months
before Daisy was murdered.

14:25.615 --> 14:26.950
Put him on the short list.

14:29.286 --> 14:31.079
-Just sent you the links.
-(phone vibrates)

14:31.121 --> 14:32.330
Thanks, brother.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.169
-Heading out?
-Dinner with Bennett.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.755
You've been seeing her now,
what, three, four months?

14:40.797 --> 14:42.424
Something like that.

14:42.465 --> 14:45.302
Think it's time to start
calling her by her first name?

14:45.343 --> 14:47.762
I don't want to get
too serious too soon.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.140
She call you "Edgar"?

14:50.181 --> 14:52.309
She calls me "Jed."

14:52.350 --> 14:53.518
You know?

14:53.560 --> 14:57.105
"J" plus "Ed..." grr.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.523
It's cute.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.650
-You even know her first name?
-Fuck off.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.944
Tell her I say hi.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.404
Not a chance.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.782
It's Joan, by the way.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.075
Kiss my ass.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.630
(typing)

15:41.232 --> 15:42.984
-(glasses clink)
-(music playing faintly
in distance)

15:43.026 --> 15:44.194
(both chuckle softly)

15:44.235 --> 15:45.528
To new friends.

15:45.570 --> 15:46.780
Salud.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.948
-Santé.
-(both chuckle)

15:50.116 --> 15:53.620
Mm. Mm.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.080
Thank you.

15:57.540 --> 16:00.919
Tomorrow, you gonna be there?

16:00.960 --> 16:03.463
That would be unnecessary.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.173
Of course.

16:05.215 --> 16:09.052
Remi will take good care of you.

16:10.220 --> 16:13.181
Mm-hmm. To new friends.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.148
(gentle jazz music
playing quietly)

16:25.985 --> 16:28.530
-Is this, uh...
-Fettuccini Alfredo.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.198
I'm impressed.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.200
I made the pasta noodles myself.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.202
I'm very impressed.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.705
-It's-it's easy as
making it from the box.
-Yeah.

16:36.746 --> 16:38.957
-That can't be true.
-Eyes on the food.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.376
Dad, there's nothing
to see over there.

16:41.418 --> 16:44.212
What am I gonna do
when you go back to school?

16:44.254 --> 16:46.673
-Learn to cook?
-Fat chance.

16:48.883 --> 16:52.220
I ran into Honey Chandler today.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.640
She wants me back next summer.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.310
That what you want?

16:59.352 --> 17:01.396
I'm not sure what I want.

17:01.438 --> 17:04.399
Second thoughts about the law?

17:04.441 --> 17:06.818
About everything.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.612
You'll figure it out.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.449
Hope so.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.535
Hey, Mads, you will.

17:15.577 --> 17:18.663
Did you go through this
when you were my age?

17:18.705 --> 17:20.957
No.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.917
I knew what I had to do.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.377
I wish I did.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.629
It's different, Mads.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.548
You have choices.

17:28.590 --> 17:29.799
I didn't.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.933
Thanks.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.435
Backseat Butcher?

17:42.437 --> 17:45.231
Take a look at this.
One of their holdbacks.

17:49.611 --> 17:53.448
Butcher left one of these
at every one of his scenes.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.241
Creep signed his kills.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.744
Daisy's killer used
the same signature.

17:57.786 --> 18:00.121
-EDGAR: Written in blood?
-BOSCH: The victim's.

18:00.163 --> 18:03.416
Thought Charles vetted everyone
on the inside.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.668
He vetted everyone
on his task force,

18:05.710 --> 18:07.712
but look at the chrono.

18:14.219 --> 18:16.805
"2315, Roger Dillon,

18:16.846 --> 18:19.641
"Postmortem Biocleaners
arrives at the scene.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.685
Advised to stand by."

18:22.727 --> 18:25.688
"2345, crime scene
is shut down."

18:25.730 --> 18:27.690
Next one's at midnight.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.568
EDGAR:
"Lieutenant Charles
opens crime scene.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.403
Allows Roger Dillon in."

18:40.411 --> 18:41.663
Crime scene cleaner.

18:41.704 --> 18:44.207
He would've seen everything.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.084
And since he wasn't
on the task force...

18:46.125 --> 18:47.752
He wouldn't have been
polygraphed.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.923
(knock on door)

18:51.965 --> 18:55.343
-Captain.
-Grace. Come in.

18:55.385 --> 18:56.594
(sighs)

19:01.558 --> 19:04.519
You're aware that, um,

19:04.561 --> 19:06.771
there's an internal complaint
filed against me?

19:06.813 --> 19:07.981
Conduct unbecoming.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.816
I.A.'s thorough and fair.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.068
Well, that's not been
my experience.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.237
If you're not at fault,
you'll be cleared.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.364
Also not my experience.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.701
Look, I know that
you filed the complaint.

19:19.742 --> 19:22.120
On Detective Vega's behalf.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.540
Yeah, but she told me
that she told you

19:25.582 --> 19:27.375
that she had no issues with me,

19:27.417 --> 19:29.878
that-that she had no intention
of filing a complaint.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.713
It can be difficult
to file a report

19:31.754 --> 19:36.092
against a superior officer
for fear of retribution.

19:36.134 --> 19:39.512
-I followed department policy.
-Yeah, but nothing happened.

19:39.554 --> 19:41.514
It's baseless.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.683
It was a misunderstanding.

19:43.725 --> 19:46.227
I apologized to Detective Vega

19:46.269 --> 19:48.897
for inadvertently
making her feel uncomfortable.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.482
A good first step.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.318
You can put this to rest.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.071
Let I.A. do its job.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.165
You don't like me, do you?

20:07.206 --> 20:08.666
Why wouldn't I like you?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.254
Is there something
I should know?

20:13.296 --> 20:15.214
Not that I know of, sir.

20:16.591 --> 20:19.052
Do you have a problem with me?

20:19.093 --> 20:21.304
Not everything
is personal, Grace.

20:21.346 --> 20:24.057
I acted according
to my duties as captain

20:24.098 --> 20:26.225
and to the policies
and procedures

20:26.267 --> 20:28.478
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.690
This is bullshit.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.651
(door opens)

20:39.364 --> 20:41.366
COOKE:
This is a conversation

20:41.407 --> 20:44.202
we have with all the candidates
before making our endorsements.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.329
We want to hear
your views and ideas

20:46.371 --> 20:49.374
on issues facing the next mayor.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.209
Well, I appreciate
the invitation,

20:51.250 --> 20:53.086
and I hope to win your support.

20:54.379 --> 20:56.214
I'll start.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.591
One of the biggest challenges
facing the next mayor

20:58.633 --> 21:00.009
is the long-standing

21:00.051 --> 21:02.220
and seemingly intractable
homeless crisis,

21:02.261 --> 21:05.765
-the third rail
of L.A. politics.
-Mm.

21:07.308 --> 21:10.186
Well, individuals and families

21:10.228 --> 21:12.689
are struggling with poverty,
unemployment,

21:12.730 --> 21:14.232
lack of affordable housing,

21:14.273 --> 21:16.234
uh, various mental
and physical health issues,

21:16.275 --> 21:17.819
lack of health insurance,

21:17.860 --> 21:19.404
while affected neighborhoods
and communities

21:19.445 --> 21:21.739
suffer from an increase
in drug use and crime.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.366
What do you propose
to do about it?

21:23.408 --> 21:25.994
Deal with it across the board.

21:26.035 --> 21:27.954
Devote real resources.

21:27.996 --> 21:30.540
And with that in mind,

21:30.581 --> 21:33.251
I'd like to formally
announce today

21:33.292 --> 21:36.671
a new LAPD initiative:
Operation Safe Sidewalks.

21:36.713 --> 21:40.842
Our goal is to confront
the homeless problem

21:40.883 --> 21:42.552
with compassionate
law enforcement.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.804
Empathy.

21:44.846 --> 21:47.056
People think this is
a hopeless situation.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.142
Incurable.

21:49.183 --> 21:50.560
I don't.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.858
I want the announcement
front page, above the fold.

21:56.899 --> 21:59.569
I'll put in a call to Cooke,
make sure.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.946
-This is not about the campaign.
-I know.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.532
-It's about the city.
-Loud and clear.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.910
Take Ms. Kowski
where she wants to go.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.620
I thought it went well.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.289
So did I.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.957
I'll call you.

22:24.218 --> 22:26.012
Chief Irving.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.972
Mr. Anderson.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.265
Got a minute?

22:29.307 --> 22:31.768
Just one.

22:31.809 --> 22:36.230
I got a audio recording
from 1996

22:36.272 --> 22:40.568
that could have serious
political repercussions for you.

22:40.610 --> 22:44.280
An audio tape from 1996?

22:44.322 --> 22:46.115
Beto Frank.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.328
And what does it
have to do with me?

22:50.369 --> 22:51.662
You're on it.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.916
You, Frank, Ryan Rodgers.

22:54.957 --> 22:59.128
Detective Rodgers kept
a copy of the interview.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.671
Don't ask me why.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.007
His daughter contacted me.

23:03.049 --> 23:06.803
She wants the Times
to do a story, investigate.

23:06.844 --> 23:09.055
Seems she's got an ax to grind.

23:09.097 --> 23:12.809
Now, I haven't taken it
to my editor just yet.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.811
What do you want?

23:14.852 --> 23:17.772
You're gonna need
a press secretary.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.982
I'm not mayor yet.

23:20.024 --> 23:23.111
Oh, I happen to think
you're gonna make a great mayor.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.530
I'd hate to see this
derail your candidacy.

23:25.571 --> 23:28.366
Would you like to listen to it?
I have a copy.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.201
You can ascertain
its authenticity.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.702
No need.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.704
Do we have an understanding?

23:33.746 --> 23:35.665
We do.

23:35.706 --> 23:38.209
Terrific.

23:41.671 --> 23:43.673
Give the tape to your editor.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.809
Detective Pierce.
How's it going?

23:54.851 --> 23:56.227
All right, sir.

23:56.269 --> 23:59.564
Um... Captain,

23:59.605 --> 24:02.900
what I told you about
my partner, about L.T....

24:02.942 --> 24:05.403
I've been meaning to thank you
for bringing that situation

24:05.444 --> 24:06.946
to my attention.

24:06.988 --> 24:09.740
Now more than ever,
we must endeavor to create

24:09.782 --> 24:11.826
a safe working environment
for everybody.

24:11.868 --> 24:13.202
Sir...

24:13.244 --> 24:16.497
I value your sense
of integrity, Detective.

24:16.539 --> 24:18.916
You take your responsibilities
seriously.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.459
I try to, sir.

24:20.501 --> 24:23.045
Someone with your talent
and ambition

24:23.087 --> 24:24.881
could be on the fast track,
Pierce.

24:24.922 --> 24:27.383
Uh, thank you, sir.

24:27.425 --> 24:29.302
When you speak to I.A.,

24:29.343 --> 24:32.054
stick to the story
you told me.

24:41.230 --> 24:43.649
Fucking kids, playing with fire.

24:43.691 --> 24:46.319
We looked at all the johns.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.738
Any of 'em good for it?

24:48.779 --> 24:50.281
Roger Dillon.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.825
Crime scene cleaner.

24:52.867 --> 24:54.994
Cleaner?

24:55.036 --> 24:56.662
Interesting.

24:58.206 --> 25:00.958
-His prints in the system?
-Had a prior DUI.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.877
I put in a request
to run 'em against

25:02.919 --> 25:04.337
the partial you lifted.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.422
Ring a bell?

25:06.464 --> 25:08.841
Most of the time,
they go in after we're gone.

25:08.883 --> 25:10.301
He work one of my scenes?

25:10.343 --> 25:11.677
Jenna Williams.

25:11.719 --> 25:13.596
Echo Park.

25:13.638 --> 25:15.223
Right.

25:19.352 --> 25:22.104
He would have seen
the Butcher's signature.

25:27.568 --> 25:29.153
I think you got your copycat.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.489
I think so, too.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.122
(engine idling)

25:47.922 --> 25:51.425
(camera beeping, clicking)

25:54.303 --> 25:57.515
-(quiet chatter)
-(phone ringing in distance)

26:12.822 --> 26:14.615
How can I help you?

26:14.657 --> 26:17.243
I'm looking to volunteer.

26:17.285 --> 26:19.745
Huh. Are you familiar
with our work?

26:19.787 --> 26:22.540
Some. I have family in Haiti.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.542
-Mainly in Port-au-Prince.
-Ah.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.711
I have cousins
in Port-au-Prince.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.547
What is your family name?
Maybe I know them.

26:29.588 --> 26:30.965
Mr. Wise.

26:32.550 --> 26:35.720
(chuckles)
You're following me.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.931
(Avril chuckles)

26:38.973 --> 26:41.934
A retired detective
with time on his hands.

26:44.103 --> 26:47.273
Lurking in the shadows
with his little camera.

26:47.315 --> 26:48.482
Hmm.

26:48.524 --> 26:49.775
What do you want?

26:49.817 --> 26:52.695
I want the names of the men
who killed my son.

26:52.737 --> 26:54.655
(laughs)

26:57.491 --> 27:01.037
How... would I know that?

27:01.078 --> 27:03.789
A witness saw two men
running from the scene.

27:03.831 --> 27:05.624
Jamaicans.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.460
I think you know who they are.

27:14.508 --> 27:16.510
Are you threatening me?

27:19.722 --> 27:21.349
I need their names.

27:23.392 --> 27:24.935
Call the police.

27:24.977 --> 27:28.189
-You know who killed my son.
-(dial tone hums)

27:28.230 --> 27:29.357
(phone dialing)

27:29.398 --> 27:31.359
(line ringing)

27:31.400 --> 27:33.069
I'd like you to leave.

27:33.110 --> 27:35.404
OPERATOR (over phone):
What's your emergency?

27:35.446 --> 27:36.405
Now.

27:36.447 --> 27:39.408
We have a trespasser.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.369
Is he inside the building?

27:43.162 --> 27:44.330
Fuck you.

27:44.372 --> 27:46.499
Sir, are you there?

27:46.540 --> 27:48.125
Is everything all right?

27:48.167 --> 27:49.585
Sir?

27:53.547 --> 27:54.757
(hangs up phone)

28:05.518 --> 28:06.519
(knock on door)

28:07.561 --> 28:09.271
-(door opens)
-Hey.

28:09.313 --> 28:11.899
I'm, uh, heading out.
Unless you need anything.

28:11.941 --> 28:14.485
See you tomorrow.

28:14.527 --> 28:16.821
You all right, L.T.?

28:16.862 --> 28:19.365
Eh, I'm just tired.

28:20.908 --> 28:22.118
Cooper?

28:24.120 --> 28:25.287
(sighs)

28:28.165 --> 28:30.709
What is his beef with you?

28:30.751 --> 28:33.879
When he got caught
juking the stats...

28:33.921 --> 28:36.882
Got his hand slapped
pretty good.

28:36.924 --> 28:40.010
Anonymous tip, as I remember.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.263
He blames me.

28:42.304 --> 28:44.473
Ah.

28:44.515 --> 28:46.142
Can I buy you a drink?

28:48.227 --> 28:49.728
I might need a couple.

28:49.770 --> 28:51.397
(chuckles)

29:05.703 --> 29:07.705
-(gentle piano music playing)
-(indistinct chatter)

29:09.331 --> 29:11.208
CHANDLER:
Always... always
getting in his way.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.836
THACKER:
Keeping-- Yeah, of course.
Keeping you on your toes.

29:13.878 --> 29:17.256
-Chief Irving.
-Soon to be "His Honor."

29:17.298 --> 29:19.967
Heard you had a big announcement
in the works.

29:20.009 --> 29:23.179
A new LAPD initiative
to combat homelessness.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.972
Hmm.

29:25.014 --> 29:28.601
Your opponents will say
it's a cynical political ploy.

29:28.642 --> 29:30.394
Why now?

29:30.436 --> 29:33.397
The homeless crisis in L.A.
has been with us for decades.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.649
Since long before
the Great Recession.

29:35.691 --> 29:38.736
It's a good policy.
And good policing.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.488
Good policing.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.656
-That would be a change.
-(chuckles)

29:42.698 --> 29:44.783
I see you've met Ray Thacker.

29:44.825 --> 29:47.411
Oh, Honey and I go way back.

29:48.704 --> 29:50.664
So, how we doing this evening?

29:50.706 --> 29:53.083
Lots of big, juicy checks,

29:53.125 --> 29:55.169
and everyone wants a selfie
with the chief.

29:57.963 --> 30:01.717
Your better half
has the hang of it.

30:01.759 --> 30:03.469
No one said
this was gonna be easy.

30:03.511 --> 30:06.055
There's a reason they call it
"working the room."

30:07.097 --> 30:08.933
Work the room.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.104
Working it.

30:21.028 --> 30:25.658
When this is over,
let's take a long vacation.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.328
When this is over,

30:29.370 --> 30:31.372
you'll be too busy
running a city.

30:33.374 --> 30:36.585
-And changing diapers.
-(chuckles)

30:36.627 --> 30:38.045
No comment.

30:39.755 --> 30:42.341
-Jen looked happy.
-(sighs)

30:42.383 --> 30:44.343
Well, she's expecting
a bump in the polls

30:44.385 --> 30:46.428
once the Times
runs the announcement.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.138
That makes sense.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.392
It's real, it's tangible,
not just an empty promise.

30:53.644 --> 30:55.938
I hope that's so.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.982
Why wouldn't it be?

31:45.237 --> 31:46.655
(engine turns off)

31:54.580 --> 31:55.914
You locked and loaded?

31:55.956 --> 31:58.917
Stuffed to the gills. $500,000.

31:58.959 --> 32:01.462
We'll coordinate our
surveillance with your DEA team.

32:01.503 --> 32:03.881
-Copy that.
-CONNIFF: When Toussaint
takes possession

32:03.922 --> 32:05.341
of the cash, we'll follow him.

32:05.382 --> 32:06.717
Hopefully to Avril.

32:06.759 --> 32:08.927
My agents will make the arrest.

32:08.969 --> 32:10.638
For money laundering.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.431
We want to interview him
ourselves.

32:12.473 --> 32:14.141
For murder.

32:15.392 --> 32:17.019
You have my word.

32:36.664 --> 32:38.624
EDGAR:
Place looks abandoned.

32:38.666 --> 32:41.043
Nah, says it's a working shop.

32:41.085 --> 32:44.338
Opens at 7:00. 57 Yelp reviews.

32:44.380 --> 32:46.507
You read them?

32:46.548 --> 32:49.760
"It's a good place
to launder money. Five stars."

32:49.802 --> 32:52.179
Clean your cash
and get your radiator replaced

32:52.221 --> 32:54.306
at the same time.

32:54.348 --> 32:56.058
Yeah. Two birds, one stone.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.643
That's what I'm saying, Brad.

32:57.685 --> 32:59.395
-Mm-hmm.
-(both chuckle)

33:01.271 --> 33:03.232
7:09.

33:03.273 --> 33:06.568
(scoffs) This dipshit's
gonna make us wait.

33:06.610 --> 33:09.238
Oh, well, I'll...
give it two stars.

33:09.279 --> 33:11.281
(doorbell chimes)

33:13.617 --> 33:15.577
Detective Bosch.

33:15.619 --> 33:18.247
Didn't actually think
you were gonna bring that back.

33:18.288 --> 33:19.873
You get anything off it?

33:19.915 --> 33:21.667
You got a minute?

33:22.710 --> 33:24.169
Yeah. We talk out here?

33:24.211 --> 33:26.714
-My daughter's just
getting ready for school.
-Sure.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.967
Ever see this guy?

33:30.008 --> 33:31.885
I don't know.
Is he one of our clients?

33:31.927 --> 33:33.929
Yeah.

33:33.971 --> 33:35.931
Long time ago.

33:35.973 --> 33:38.517
You got any old photos
of yourself from that time?

33:38.559 --> 33:41.019
-Yeah, I can probably
dig one up.
-Text it to me.

33:41.061 --> 33:42.354
-When?
-Now.

33:43.397 --> 33:45.023
Will do.

33:53.115 --> 33:55.617
What the fuck's
taking him so long?

33:55.659 --> 33:57.035
(Bennett sighs)

33:59.163 --> 34:00.664
Let me check with DEA.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.083
Maybe they're seeing
something we can't.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.877
This is Bennett.

34:04.918 --> 34:06.545
You guys seeing
any signs of life?

34:06.587 --> 34:09.256
AGENT:
Nope. Nary a one.

34:10.424 --> 34:12.050
Copy. Thanks.

34:13.594 --> 34:16.388
You heard him. Nary a one.

34:25.355 --> 34:26.857
Who's he calling?

34:26.899 --> 34:30.235
(ringtone playing)

34:30.277 --> 34:33.655
Hovan. You're on speaker.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.657
HOVAN:
How long we gonna wait?

34:35.699 --> 34:37.618
It's after 9:00.

34:39.036 --> 34:40.621
You heard from Toussaint?

34:40.662 --> 34:42.122
Nothing.

34:42.164 --> 34:43.916
What do you think happened?

34:43.957 --> 34:46.293
I don't know, man.

34:46.335 --> 34:47.961
I don't know.

34:49.546 --> 34:51.131
I think we're burned.

34:51.173 --> 34:54.092
Maybe they're watching us
as we speak.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.971
Let's pack it in.

34:58.013 --> 35:00.098
Take it back to the barn.

35:00.140 --> 35:02.684
-(line rings)
-WOMAN: Postmortem Biocleaners.

35:02.726 --> 35:06.897
Yeah, this is Detective Bosch,
LAPD, badge number 2997.

35:06.939 --> 35:09.024
Looking for Roger Dillon.
He around?

35:09.066 --> 35:11.235
I can take a message,
have him call you back.

35:11.276 --> 35:12.945
-You handle scheduling?
-Sure do.

35:12.986 --> 35:15.239
-Where is he right now?
-He's out on a job,

35:15.280 --> 35:17.783
probably for another
couple hours or so.

35:17.825 --> 35:20.619
-Give me that address, please.
-Sure thing.

35:22.079 --> 35:24.915
(ringtone playing)

35:24.957 --> 35:26.124
Hello?

35:26.166 --> 35:28.126
AVRIL:
Bonjou, Detective.

35:28.168 --> 35:30.587
Bon maten.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.214
Monsieur Avril?

35:32.256 --> 35:35.050
I have a little bit
of a problem.

35:35.092 --> 35:38.095
I was hoping you might
be able to help me.

35:39.346 --> 35:41.348
(vacuum whirring loudly)

35:52.860 --> 35:54.903
(birds chirping)

35:54.945 --> 35:56.572
(dog barking in distance)

36:05.789 --> 36:09.376
Mr. Dillon. Detective Bosch.

36:09.418 --> 36:11.837
Ah. Morning, Detective.

36:16.967 --> 36:19.094
Was hoping maybe
you could help me out,

36:19.136 --> 36:20.846
answer a couple of questions.

36:20.888 --> 36:23.015
-Nothing serious.
-Yeah, anything
I can do to help.

36:23.056 --> 36:26.059
I so appreciate what you guys
do. More than most folks.

36:26.101 --> 36:27.811
No need to blow smoke up my ass.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.563
You already got the contract
with the city, right?

36:29.605 --> 36:32.149
(chuckles):
Absolutely. Sorry.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.151
So, uh, you have questions?

36:37.154 --> 36:38.989
Ever seen this kid before?

36:40.282 --> 36:42.242
Don't think so.
Uh, what's his deal?

36:42.284 --> 36:44.244
He's a con artist.

36:44.286 --> 36:46.079
Hmm. No.

36:46.121 --> 36:47.956
Uh, drawing a blank. Sorry.

36:50.459 --> 36:52.461
Found your name and number
on his computer.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.173
Hmm. That's weird.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.591
Should I be worried?

36:57.633 --> 37:00.177
We thought you might be
one of his victims.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.429
Yeah, not-not that I know of.

37:02.471 --> 37:05.515
Um... sorry I couldn't
be more help.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.935
One last look.

37:07.976 --> 37:11.563
Yeah, I don't,
I don't recognize him.

37:11.605 --> 37:12.981
Thanks for your time.

37:13.023 --> 37:14.441
Yeah.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.503
(engine turns off)

37:58.235 --> 37:59.861
Come in, Detective Edgar.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.504
Will you take a café?

38:17.546 --> 38:20.966
No, thank you. Why am I here?

38:21.008 --> 38:23.719
Sit, please.

38:26.388 --> 38:28.390
(chuckles)

38:30.434 --> 38:33.520
I was recently approached
by a drug dealer.

38:33.562 --> 38:36.732
Something of a kingpin.

38:36.773 --> 38:38.567
A Dominican fellow.

38:38.608 --> 38:42.654
Thought I might be interested
in a business opportunity.

38:42.696 --> 38:44.072
To deal drugs?

38:44.114 --> 38:45.532
(scoffs)

38:48.160 --> 38:51.830
To use my charity
to launder his l'argent.

38:51.872 --> 38:54.124
Clean his filthy cash.

38:54.166 --> 38:56.376
Hmm. So what did you say to him?

38:56.418 --> 38:58.128
What could I say?

38:58.170 --> 39:00.547
No, of course.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.342
So what am I doing here?

39:06.178 --> 39:08.555
I am an honest citizen.

39:08.597 --> 39:12.059
It is my duty to report
this man to the law.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.935
You have a name?

39:16.146 --> 39:18.315
Felix Mariama.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.941
I'll look into it.

39:19.983 --> 39:23.153
Merci. Oh, one more thing.

39:23.195 --> 39:26.615
I know the names of the men
who killed your two detectives.

39:29.951 --> 39:31.369
I'm listening.

39:32.412 --> 39:35.373
John Winston and Robert Marvel.
