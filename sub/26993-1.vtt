00:29.893 --> 00:32.659
Whoa!

00:32.661 --> 00:34.664
Hm! Yeah! Oh!

01:05.461 --> 01:07.460
<i>Namaste.</i>

01:07.462 --> 01:09.796
A long time ago
in a valley in Nepal,

01:09.798 --> 01:11.731
there lived a poor peasant

01:11.733 --> 01:13.667
whose only possession was
a big, strong yak.

01:13.669 --> 01:16.270
He was proud of his yak!

01:16.272 --> 01:18.472
One morning, the yak ran away

01:18.474 --> 01:20.774
into the mountains.
When they heard the news,

01:20.776 --> 01:22.710
the peasant's neighbours
came running.

01:22.712 --> 01:24.946
"Such bad luck," they told him.

01:24.948 --> 01:26.981
But the peasant smiled
and said,

01:26.983 --> 01:30.484
"Good luck or bad luck,
who can say?"

01:30.486 --> 01:32.886
The neighbours

01:32.888 --> 01:35.556
couldn't understand
what the old man meant,

01:35.558 --> 01:38.658
but several days later, the yak
returns from the mountain,

01:38.660 --> 01:41.729
accompanied by a few
other wild yaks.

01:41.731 --> 01:44.732
When he arrived, the neighbours
came to congratulate the peasant

01:44.734 --> 01:47.401
on his good fortune,
but once again,

01:47.403 --> 01:50.303
- he says,
- "Good luck or bad luck,

01:50.305 --> 01:52.940
- who can say?"
- The next day,

01:52.942 --> 01:55.509
as the son was
tending to the yaks,

01:55.511 --> 01:57.845
he fell and broke his leg.

01:57.847 --> 01:59.847
All of the villagers see this
as bad luck,

01:59.849 --> 02:01.949
but not the peasant.

02:01.951 --> 02:04.952
He happily says, one more time,

02:04.954 --> 02:07.554
"Good luck or bad luck,
who can say?"

02:07.556 --> 02:09.556
A few days later,

02:09.558 --> 02:12.759
a warlord arrives in the village
with his army,

02:12.761 --> 02:15.929
and all of the young men are
drafted to go fight the war.

02:15.931 --> 02:17.931
But when the peasant's son
shows up

02:17.933 --> 02:19.933
with his broken leg,

02:19.935 --> 02:22.802
the soldiers let him go free.
And so,

02:22.804 --> 02:25.675
was it good luck or bad luck?

03:58.800 --> 04:01.669
- To the university.
- Step on it. - What's this?

04:01.671 --> 04:03.871
Get out!

04:03.873 --> 04:05.873
What's going on?!

04:05.875 --> 04:08.843
Investigation gone wrong.
Happens to everyone.

04:08.845 --> 04:11.579
Stop the car! Oof!

04:13.482 --> 04:16.483
I am Édouard Martineau II!

04:16.486 --> 04:18.853
I insist that you... Oh!

04:18.855 --> 04:20.987
Nelly Maloye,
private detective.

04:20.988 --> 04:23.157
"Intuition in service
of the truth."

04:23.159 --> 04:25.693
- It's a full service agency. Ah!
- Oh!

04:25.695 --> 04:27.697
Ah! Oh!

04:31.134 --> 04:33.633
Oh, be assured,
my dear Mrs. Martineau,

04:33.635 --> 04:36.736
we're most grateful for the
generous donation your family

04:36.738 --> 04:38.772
plans to give to our university.

04:38.774 --> 04:41.508
Yes, well, thank my son
Édouard. He enjoys boosting

04:41.510 --> 04:44.611
his popularity by spending
his late father's fortune.

04:44.613 --> 04:47.647
Huh! Where is he, anyway?
He should be here already.

04:47.649 --> 04:49.616
While you wait,
perhaps you'd like

04:49.618 --> 04:51.618
an exclusive look at the hall

04:51.620 --> 04:54.555
that now bears
your son's moniker.

04:54.557 --> 04:57.056
- Typically ostentatious.
- Mhm, hm.

04:57.058 --> 04:59.460
Hm?

05:02.432 --> 05:04.498
Mr. Picard?

05:04.500 --> 05:06.603
Why are you here?

05:08.805 --> 05:11.539
What's that
curious-looking thing?

05:11.541 --> 05:14.474
A hypothesis, ma'am.
Relying on solid research,

05:14.476 --> 05:17.077
I determined the form,
proportion, organ size,

05:17.079 --> 05:19.180
musculature and
follicle density of...

05:19.182 --> 05:22.683
- The yeti.
- Precisely! The yeti.

05:22.685 --> 05:25.685
- Why have you brought it in here?
- The faculty boasts

05:25.687 --> 05:27.520
that it displays
all stages of evolution.

05:27.522 --> 05:29.222
Therefore, we need a yeti.

05:29.224 --> 05:31.692
I thought this was
a science museum!

05:31.694 --> 05:33.527
Yes! Yes, don't worry.
We practice

05:33.529 --> 05:35.729
the scientific method:
we establish a hypothesis,

05:35.731 --> 05:37.798
we discuss it
and then we throw it out.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.801
Your yeti theory
is bunk, Mr. Picard.

05:40.803 --> 05:42.803
Ha! Correction: its existence

05:42.805 --> 05:44.938
hasn't been proven.
Just a matter of time.

05:44.940 --> 05:47.741
Crazy ramblings
of a twisted soul.

05:47.743 --> 05:49.810
Scientific,

05:49.812 --> 05:51.811
- but twisted.
- In their day,

05:51.813 --> 05:54.815
Galileo, Newton and Einstein
were also thought to be bonkers.

05:54.817 --> 05:57.784
But now, they're hailed as pillars
of modern scientific thought.

05:57.786 --> 05:59.953
Are you comparing
yourself to Newton?

05:59.955 --> 06:01.822
I also mentioned
Einstein and Galileo.

06:01.824 --> 06:04.791
Well, now you've
gone too far, Picard!

06:04.793 --> 06:08.229
Challenging the boundaries of
knowledge is the scientists' mission.

06:12.801 --> 06:15.503
Get out! That's an order!

06:23.613 --> 06:25.779
Here's your fare, sir.

06:25.781 --> 06:27.882
You can keep the change.

06:32.255 --> 06:35.154
The chief of police is a good
friend of the Martineau family!

06:35.156 --> 06:37.590
Better find a new career,
young lady.

06:37.592 --> 06:39.560
No, wait! Please,
don't do this!

06:39.562 --> 06:41.895
You'll be ruining the career

06:41.897 --> 06:44.864
of a first-class detective,
you know.

06:44.866 --> 06:47.734
Let me make it up to you!

06:47.736 --> 06:49.736
Keep that girl

06:49.738 --> 06:51.938
- out of the building!
- Yes, sir, Mr. Martineau!

06:51.940 --> 06:54.575
- No!
- Don't you dare touch me!

06:54.577 --> 06:57.911
Ow! Ow! Ee! Ee! Ow!

06:57.913 --> 07:01.181
If you give me one hour, I'll
convince you that the yeti is

07:01.183 --> 07:03.183
- the missing link in the chain!
- You must have a few enemies

07:03.185 --> 07:05.185
I could investigate!
I'll conduct

07:05.187 --> 07:07.320
a full inquiry!
All charges on the house!

07:07.322 --> 07:09.757
Mr. Martineau!
Are you alright?

07:09.759 --> 07:12.760
- Édouard, what happened? - Ah...
- Get her out of my sight!

07:12.762 --> 07:15.662
Now, hang on!

07:15.664 --> 07:17.664
Hm?

07:17.666 --> 07:20.166
Oh, there you are!

07:20.168 --> 07:22.236
- What a nice surprise!
- Do you know this young woman?

07:22.238 --> 07:25.606
- Uh...
- Yes, very well! We go way back!

07:25.608 --> 07:27.575
Poor character reference.
Who is she?

07:27.577 --> 07:29.909
- His sister.
- My neighbour.

07:29.911 --> 07:32.346
- Sorry? - His neighbour.
- My sister... and neighbour.

07:32.348 --> 07:34.914
- Sister and neighbour.
- Ah, show this

07:34.916 --> 07:38.185
- miss whoever-she-is out, please.
- Yes, sir, Professor! OH!

07:38.187 --> 07:40.887
Oh, wait 'til I get you!

07:40.889 --> 07:43.123
- Get back here, you! Hey!
- Watch out for the mammoth!

07:43.125 --> 07:45.625
- Oof!
- I'll be right back.

07:45.627 --> 07:49.229
Argh! Get her!
On the left! On the left! OH!

07:49.231 --> 07:52.832
My dear Édouard, do you really
think I'm going to finance

07:52.834 --> 07:54.835
- this circus?
- Mother, dear!

07:54.837 --> 07:57.303
This room bears my name. This is
my chance to make my mark

07:57.305 --> 08:00.007
- on the world.
- Find some other way to do it.

08:00.009 --> 08:02.008
Your father gave you his name,

08:02.010 --> 08:04.678
and I refuse to use
his money to sully it!

08:04.680 --> 08:07.714
- No, no, no, no!
- I got her! I got her!

08:07.716 --> 08:10.851
- Stop this!
- WATCH OUT FOR THE MAMMOTH!

08:14.856 --> 08:16.789
Now, look what you've done!

08:16.791 --> 08:20.260
Mrs. Martineau,
where are you going?

08:20.262 --> 08:23.130
Now that you've
shown me the clowns,

08:23.132 --> 08:25.366
I'll show you
my disappearing magic trick.

08:25.368 --> 08:27.635
What about your gift?
For the museum?

08:27.637 --> 08:29.736
That's what I mean.

08:29.738 --> 08:33.339
It's gone to Nepal, along
with your nonexistent yeti.

08:33.341 --> 08:36.342
Oh! This time, Simon Picard,

08:36.344 --> 08:39.046
you've gone too far.
You're fired! Get out!

08:39.048 --> 08:42.315
Huh?

08:42.317 --> 08:44.318
On what grounds
am I being fired?

08:44.320 --> 08:47.321
You don't have what it takes to be
part of the anthropology department.

08:47.323 --> 08:49.323
Passion only goes so far.

08:49.325 --> 08:51.759
- You need much more than that.
- I've done my research!

08:51.761 --> 08:54.861
There are creatures that resemble
the yeti in many countries!

08:54.863 --> 08:56.896
In the United States,
there's bigfoot.

08:56.898 --> 08:58.899
In Canada, there's sasquatch.

08:58.901 --> 09:01.834
In China, there's yeren.
In Australia, there's yowie,

09:01.836 --> 09:05.271
and in Russia, there's chuchunya.
How do you explain that?

09:05.273 --> 09:07.140
Science is built on proof,

09:07.142 --> 09:09.143
Mr. Picard, not on hearsay.

09:09.145 --> 09:11.145
But there is proof
that the yeti exists!

09:11.147 --> 09:13.079
Then go and find it!

09:13.081 --> 09:15.281
What? In the Himalayas?

09:15.283 --> 09:18.919
Where there's ice and cold
and hunger? It's just... I...

09:18.921 --> 09:20.920
You have three months.
Bring back proof

09:20.922 --> 09:23.691
the yeti exists,
and I'll reverse my decision

09:23.693 --> 09:26.125
and give you back the teaching
position I promised you.

09:26.127 --> 09:28.127
If you don't you're fired.

09:28.129 --> 09:31.097
Go on. Bring back a strand
of hair as proof.

09:31.099 --> 09:32.935
Something!

09:39.340 --> 09:41.741
Mr. Picard.

09:43.746 --> 09:46.380
If you would like to find proof
of your yeti's existence,

09:46.382 --> 09:48.749
I'll finance your expedition.

09:48.751 --> 09:50.750
I'm afraid I'm the wrong man.

09:50.752 --> 09:53.187
Many adventurers have tried
to find it, and all have failed.

09:53.189 --> 09:55.255
Almost all of them.

09:55.257 --> 09:57.191
What do you mean?
You mean someone has

09:57.193 --> 09:59.125
already discovered the yeti?

09:59.127 --> 10:00.961
Well, there's actually
something in Taylor's office

10:00.963 --> 10:02.866
that might answer
that precise question.

10:04.867 --> 10:06.866
Look at this.

10:06.868 --> 10:09.202
- What is it?
- The diary of Fred Norton,

10:09.204 --> 10:11.204
a member
of Madison's expedition.

10:11.206 --> 10:13.340
I'm certain it holds the secret
which leads to the yeti.

10:13.342 --> 10:15.875
Taylor keeps it in a safe
with other artifacts.

10:15.877 --> 10:18.111
Then why doesn't Taylor
think it exists?

10:18.113 --> 10:20.380
- What do you mean?
- You said Taylor has proof

10:20.382 --> 10:22.482
- it exists.
- He has proof, but he doesn't know it.

10:22.484 --> 10:25.119
- What do you mean?
- Taylor thinks it's just

10:25.121 --> 10:27.821
a relic from an expedition.
Convince him to lend it to you,

10:27.823 --> 10:29.823
and... I'll think
about your offer.

10:29.825 --> 10:31.824
He's friendlier
with my mother.

10:31.826 --> 10:34.394
And after today's disaster,
she'll be of no help at all.

10:34.396 --> 10:36.395
Well, in that case...

10:43.973 --> 10:46.472
- Ahem.
- Huh?

11:07.329 --> 11:09.862
Come in.

11:09.864 --> 11:12.399
Leave it there.
The money's on the table.

11:12.401 --> 11:14.233
Excuse me?

11:14.235 --> 11:16.102
Keep the change, and...

11:16.104 --> 11:18.505
close the door, please.

11:18.507 --> 11:21.842
- It's your sister.
- I don't have a...

11:21.844 --> 11:24.077
Who are you, anyway?
How did you find me?

11:24.079 --> 11:26.246
Nelly Maloye,
private detective.

11:26.248 --> 11:28.481
"Intuition in service
of the truth."

11:28.483 --> 11:31.385
I think I can help you.

11:31.387 --> 11:33.287
Do you happen to have
an autographed photograph

11:33.289 --> 11:35.322
of a yeti?

11:35.324 --> 11:37.256
Ah, that must be my food.

11:37.258 --> 11:40.394
- You hungry?
- Mhm!

11:40.396 --> 11:43.396
He gave me three months
to prove the yeti exists,

11:43.398 --> 11:45.399
but I'm not an adventurer!

11:45.401 --> 11:47.467
The Himalayas are the highest
mountains in the world,

11:47.469 --> 11:51.004
with bitterly cold weather,
altitude sickness, crevices!

11:51.006 --> 11:53.539
People come back changed
from the Himalayas,

11:53.541 --> 11:55.542
- or they don't come back at all.
- What are you gonna do?

11:55.544 --> 11:57.544
Well, my dream was to teach

11:57.546 --> 11:59.545
anthropology, but now...

11:59.547 --> 12:01.548
You really think he exists?
The yeti?

12:01.550 --> 12:04.116
Of course! Listen to this.

12:06.387 --> 12:08.288
- Wha...
- A colleague recorded this

12:08.290 --> 12:10.289
in the Himalayas.
It cost me a fortune!

12:10.291 --> 12:12.125
How do you know
that's not a camel?

12:12.127 --> 12:14.361
It's not. The camel has
a sharper pitch. Listen again.

12:16.931 --> 12:18.932
Pfft!

12:18.934 --> 12:21.334
That's a dog bark played
backwards. Cry of the yeti!

12:26.342 --> 12:29.208
OK. Whatever.
But this is the real deal!

12:29.210 --> 12:31.345
Eric Shipton,
the famous climber,

12:31.347 --> 12:33.614
took it in 1951
on the Menlung Glacier.

12:33.616 --> 12:36.015
The shape, the size, the depth:

12:36.017 --> 12:39.151
no other animal leaves
footprints like this!

12:39.153 --> 12:41.355
That's one heck of a beast.

12:41.357 --> 12:43.356
Well, this beast, as you say,

12:43.358 --> 12:45.292
might be our common ancestor,

12:45.294 --> 12:48.428
our grandfather, our patriarch!
The missing link in the chain!

12:48.430 --> 12:51.030
If I could prove that it has
survived to this day,

12:51.032 --> 12:53.399
I'll share my discovery
with all mankind!

12:53.401 --> 12:55.401
So, you have to go!

12:55.403 --> 12:57.406
That's one heck of a beast!

13:02.444 --> 13:05.312
- You're beautiful!
- May I present,

13:05.314 --> 13:07.313
Jazzmin, he's a myna.

13:07.315 --> 13:09.316
- Jazzmin, Nelly.
- That's one heck

13:09.318 --> 13:11.318
- of a beast!
- Hey!

13:11.320 --> 13:13.323
Oh! You're beautiful!

13:15.424 --> 13:18.925
- And what is that?
- Oh, this is a diary.

13:18.927 --> 13:20.994
Oh! That's what Martineau
wants me to find!

13:20.996 --> 13:22.996
- Martineau hired you?
- Then as soon as we get

13:22.998 --> 13:26.533
- the journal, we're off to Nepal!
- Huh? We're travelling to Nepal?

13:26.535 --> 13:28.534
Martineau's paying
for the trip.

13:28.536 --> 13:31.907
If we find the yeti, it'll be
a big career boost for me.

13:42.584 --> 13:44.684
HELP! HELP!

13:44.686 --> 13:48.221
SOMEBODY STOLE MY PURSE! HELP!

13:48.223 --> 13:51.223
- What happened, lady?
- A thief stole my purse!

13:51.225 --> 13:53.125
- Where? - He went that way!
- Which way?

13:53.127 --> 13:56.129
That way, I said!
Left at the corner!

13:56.131 --> 13:59.366
- Huh? Looks like he got away.
- You'll be able to catch him, he was limping.

13:59.368 --> 14:01.367
Limping, huh? OK!

14:01.369 --> 14:03.437
- I'll call the police.
- No! You go after him!

14:03.439 --> 14:06.273
- I said he went that way!
- You again!

14:06.275 --> 14:08.542
- Oh!
- Hmm!

14:10.445 --> 14:13.079
Oh, when I...

14:22.090 --> 14:24.293
Huh?

14:30.366 --> 14:33.033
Shh! It's me.

14:47.081 --> 14:49.448
- Whoa!
- Nelly, this way!

14:49.450 --> 14:52.284
This is it!

14:57.126 --> 14:59.629
He's coming!

15:07.469 --> 15:09.472
Huh?

15:19.180 --> 15:21.180
Let me see.

15:21.182 --> 15:23.784
What make is this lock?
General! Perfect!

15:31.459 --> 15:34.294
There's the safe!

15:34.296 --> 15:36.263
Fred Norton's journal is inside.

15:36.265 --> 15:38.798
Do you trust this guy Martineau?

15:38.800 --> 15:41.834
No, but he did reserve passage
for us on a boat...

15:41.836 --> 15:44.504
which sets sail
at four o'clock in the morning.

15:44.506 --> 15:46.606
Better hurry!

15:46.608 --> 15:48.607
Oh, this is not good.

15:48.609 --> 15:50.476
- Not good at all!
- What? Is there a problem?

15:50.478 --> 15:53.179
There's a major problem!
This is a Patterson safe!

15:53.181 --> 15:55.182
Patterson starts with a P.

15:55.184 --> 15:57.451
I only know up to the letter M.
The lock on the door

15:57.453 --> 15:59.452
is a general lock
which starts with a G,

15:59.454 --> 16:01.487
so that was no problem.

16:01.489 --> 16:03.622
Now, if this was
a Montana or a Marconi,

16:03.624 --> 16:06.092
I could crack it in a flash,
but a Patterson?

16:06.094 --> 16:08.095
I haven't gotten
to the letter P!

16:08.097 --> 16:10.329
You're learning to crack safes
in alphabetical order?

16:10.331 --> 16:12.466
Of course! I'm methodical.

16:12.468 --> 16:15.304
Then let's be methodical.

16:20.843 --> 16:23.275
Here it is!

16:23.277 --> 16:25.412
- Ha ha!
- Come on!

16:27.349 --> 16:29.185
Hm? Hm?

16:30.719 --> 16:33.220
Hm...

16:35.724 --> 16:38.225
What we just did
is strictly illegal!

16:38.227 --> 16:41.260
We'll rot in
prison for the rest of our lives!

16:41.262 --> 16:43.295
Relax, nobody saw us!

16:43.297 --> 16:46.399
I'm a professional!
Put on your knapsack.

16:46.401 --> 16:49.602
Our ship sails
in less than an hour.

16:49.604 --> 16:51.571
- What is that?
- It's a pocket knife!

16:51.573 --> 16:53.640
My neighbour gave it to me.
You see?

16:53.642 --> 16:56.308
It has a knife, some scissors,

16:56.310 --> 16:59.279
a screwdriver, a loop,
some pliers,

16:59.281 --> 17:01.581
a can opener, and... a thingy.

17:01.583 --> 17:04.183
- Wow.
- I traded this little marvel

17:04.185 --> 17:06.486
for Jazzmin. A pocketknife
is much more practical

17:06.488 --> 17:09.890
- than a myna in the Himalayas.
- You're leaving Jazzmin with your neighbour?

17:09.892 --> 17:12.291
Hi, little fella.

17:12.294 --> 17:14.294
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Come here!

17:14.296 --> 17:16.496
- You're beautiful!
- Come with me!

17:16.498 --> 17:18.497
- Yahoo! Ha ha!
- Jazzmin!

17:18.499 --> 17:20.733
Woo! Boing! Woo!

17:20.736 --> 17:22.669
Ha ha!

17:22.671 --> 17:25.237
Woo! Woo!

17:25.239 --> 17:27.273
Ha ha!

17:27.276 --> 17:30.677
I got him! I lost him.

17:30.679 --> 17:33.612
Birdy, birdy, birdy!
Come with me! He hoo!

17:33.614 --> 17:35.614
Birdy, birdy, birdy!

17:35.616 --> 17:37.617
Use your hand!

17:43.191 --> 17:45.659
- Hey! Hey! Wait!
- Hey! Wait for us!

17:45.661 --> 17:47.660
- Wait! Hey! We're here!
- Wait!

17:53.367 --> 17:56.335
Nelly!

18:01.610 --> 18:03.976
Whoa!

18:03.978 --> 18:08.515
Ah!

18:22.965 --> 18:24.965
Oh!

18:29.571 --> 18:31.670
What an entrance!
Welcome aboard

18:31.672 --> 18:33.672
the S. S. Indiana. Your friend,

18:33.674 --> 18:36.342
Mrs. Martineau's son,
hopes you have a great trip.

18:36.344 --> 18:38.344
Could you take me
to him, please?

18:38.346 --> 18:40.346
Oh, sorry. Mr. Martineau
isn't on board. He's sailing

18:40.348 --> 18:43.617
- on a different ship.
- Where? - There.

18:48.690 --> 18:50.689
We're off to Nepal!

18:50.691 --> 18:52.524
Jazzmin!

18:52.526 --> 18:54.396
This way.

18:57.399 --> 18:59.365
What language is this?

18:59.367 --> 19:02.268
No idea. I hope
the Nepalese can tell me.

19:02.270 --> 19:04.303
What's so special
about this journal?

19:04.305 --> 19:06.339
Norton was part of the doomed
Madison expedition

19:06.341 --> 19:08.707
that mysteriously disappeared
near the Menlung Glacier

19:08.709 --> 19:10.709
over 30 years ago. There were

19:10.711 --> 19:13.280
no survivors. At least,
that's what we thought,

19:13.282 --> 19:15.015
until Norton
mysteriously reappeared

19:15.017 --> 19:17.016
in a village one day, exhausted

19:17.018 --> 19:19.686
and half-crazed. The university
bought his journal...

19:19.688 --> 19:22.322
...shortly before his death.

19:22.324 --> 19:24.323
I'm quite convinced
that the Madison expedition

19:24.325 --> 19:27.627
discovered the yeti on the Menlung
Glacier, and that's how they met

19:27.629 --> 19:29.528
their fate.
Once the journal is deciphered,

19:29.530 --> 19:31.464
I'll know
where to find the yeti.

19:31.466 --> 19:33.466
Mr. Martineau insisted

19:33.468 --> 19:35.470
that you have our finest cabin.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.439
Hm... uh.

19:49.551 --> 19:51.554
Uh...

20:07.635 --> 20:10.469
And over the Big Dipper,
you can see the Little Dipper.

20:10.471 --> 20:12.471
And, to the far right,

20:12.473 --> 20:15.542
is the North Star. She has been
a sailor's guide for centuries,

20:15.544 --> 20:17.409
and, uh... the North Star

20:17.411 --> 20:19.079
is in the wrong location.

20:19.081 --> 20:21.514
- Uh, Captain?
- Captain?

20:21.516 --> 20:24.351
Can you explain why we're sailing
south when India's to the east?

20:24.353 --> 20:27.454
We are taking a short detour
to pick up some cargo

20:27.456 --> 20:29.688
in Australia. Have you
ever seen a kangaroo?

20:29.690 --> 20:33.459
You've gotta be kidding!
I've only got three months

20:33.461 --> 20:36.095
- to find the yeti...
- Hey! We paid to go to India!

20:36.097 --> 20:38.931
Two trips for the price
of one! What a deal!

20:38.933 --> 20:41.868
Enjoy the sun! Relax
in the comfort of your cabin!

20:41.870 --> 20:44.036
It'll be as though you're
on a leisurely cruise!

20:44.038 --> 20:46.038
Ha ha!

20:46.040 --> 20:48.410
Huh. Hm... hm?

20:55.816 --> 20:58.717
One, two!

20:58.719 --> 21:01.854
- One, two!
- Bring back my lifeboat,

21:01.856 --> 21:04.390
you bunch of pirates!
Bring back my lifeboat!

21:04.392 --> 21:06.392
One, two!

21:06.394 --> 21:08.460
One, two!

21:08.462 --> 21:11.466
One... what?

21:15.636 --> 21:17.637
One, two!

21:17.639 --> 21:19.538
One, two!

21:19.540 --> 21:21.409
One...

21:29.418 --> 21:32.822
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

21:55.544 --> 21:57.544
Whoa!

21:57.546 --> 21:59.748
Boing.

22:08.923 --> 22:10.924
We're in Durbar Square,
alright!

22:10.926 --> 22:13.759
Pretty nice place!

22:20.901 --> 22:22.768
Hm.

22:28.776 --> 22:30.779
Huh?

22:35.784 --> 22:38.985
The things people will do
to entertain the tourists.

22:38.987 --> 22:41.653
So, where does

22:41.655 --> 22:44.426
- the Gombu family live?
- West of Durbar Square.

22:47.696 --> 22:50.263
I'm sure they'll be able
to decode the diary.

22:50.265 --> 22:51.898
The Gombu family have
been mountain guides

22:51.900 --> 22:53.899
for generations.
A member of their family

22:53.901 --> 22:56.639
actually disappeared
on the Madison Expedition.

23:01.008 --> 23:04.142
I'm lost.

23:04.144 --> 23:06.144
Alright, this is it!

23:06.146 --> 23:08.113
Boy, you gotta be really lost

23:08.115 --> 23:10.082
to say you're lost
when you're not lost.

23:10.084 --> 23:12.150
Huh?

23:12.152 --> 23:15.021
Uh...

23:15.023 --> 23:16.555
<i>Namaste?</i>

23:16.557 --> 23:19.225
Ahem.

23:19.227 --> 23:21.628
<i>Namaste!</i>

23:21.630 --> 23:23.595
My name is Simon Picard, and...

23:23.597 --> 23:25.532
I'm Nelly Maloye,
private detective.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.534
"Intuition in service
of the truth."

23:27.536 --> 23:30.038
We come as friends.
Oh, and <i>namaste</i> to you.

23:32.239 --> 23:35.710
We're looking
for a family named Gombu.

23:37.879 --> 23:40.612
Well, I think we've
exhausted the topic.

23:40.614 --> 23:43.149
Uh... we hope you have
a very lovely evening.

23:43.151 --> 23:45.150
- <i>Dhanyabad!</i>
- Isn't it <i>namaste?</i>

23:45.152 --> 23:46.986
- No, you say <i>dhanyabad.</i>
- I thought it was <i>namaste.</i>

23:46.988 --> 23:48.821
- In this case, it's <i>dhanyabad.</i>
- It's <i>namaste.</i>

23:48.823 --> 23:50.622
- <i>Dhanyabad.</i>
- OH!

23:50.624 --> 23:54.159
<i>Namaste!</i> May I help you?

23:54.161 --> 23:57.095
A member of your family

23:57.097 --> 23:59.098
was a guide
on the Madison Expedition.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.935
This is Fred Norton's journal.

24:01.937 --> 24:03.902
He wrote it
while on the expedition

24:03.904 --> 24:05.971
while in the company
of your relative.

24:05.973 --> 24:08.307
- <i>Dhanyabad.</i>
- <i>Dhanyabad.</i>

24:15.717 --> 24:18.184
There are many symbols
and diagrams.

24:18.186 --> 24:20.656
I was hoping you'd decode it?

24:22.856 --> 24:25.691
If you turn to the third page,
there's a strange character.

24:27.828 --> 24:29.896
The symbol is quite fascinating!

24:29.898 --> 24:31.898
Norton was no doubt
trying to tell us something.

24:36.004 --> 24:38.236
<i>Namaste!</i> May I have a look?

24:38.238 --> 24:41.040
- Tensing!
- Oh, sure.

24:41.042 --> 24:43.042
It belongs to one
of Madison's colleagues.

24:43.044 --> 24:45.143
It's about Madison?
And my grandfather?

24:45.145 --> 24:47.045
Yes! At least, I think it is.

24:47.047 --> 24:49.782
- What do you wanna do with it?
- I hope to find the yeti.

24:49.784 --> 24:52.087
Pfft!

24:54.088 --> 24:56.823
And we need a good guide.

24:56.825 --> 24:59.891
This is just a bunch
of scribbles, sahib.

24:59.893 --> 25:02.027
But they've gotta
mean something, don't they?

25:03.864 --> 25:06.365
Good luck. <i>Namaste.</i>

25:26.321 --> 25:28.955
Sahib!

25:28.957 --> 25:31.658
Sahib!

25:31.660 --> 25:33.892
Are you really going off

25:33.894 --> 25:35.894
- to search for the yeti?
- Yes, we are. Then it is

25:35.896 --> 25:38.264
my duty to carry on the work
of my grandfather.

25:38.266 --> 25:40.265
I'm coming with you.

25:40.267 --> 25:43.136
Welcome to our adventure,
Tensing.

25:43.138 --> 25:45.107
<i>Namaste!</i>

25:48.410 --> 25:50.810
This is the famous
Cavendish Hotel

25:50.812 --> 25:52.815
- you were looking for.
- Marvelous!

25:59.720 --> 26:01.954
Do you think
he's checked in yet?

26:01.956 --> 26:04.959
There you are,
my dear friends!

26:07.194 --> 26:10.095
Édouard, I'd like you
to meet Tensing Gombu.

26:10.097 --> 26:12.465
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm afraid there's bad news.

26:12.467 --> 26:15.234
The Kadamba region has been
hit with a bad storm.

26:15.236 --> 26:18.170
The roads are closed.
We'll have to wait several weeks

26:18.172 --> 26:21.107
- before they open again.
- Planes fly in bad weather.

26:21.109 --> 26:23.376
Excellent idea!
We'll parachute you in

26:23.378 --> 26:26.379
with your equipment, right
on top of the Semtong Glacier.

26:26.381 --> 26:28.413
- Menlung.
- Whatever you say.

26:28.415 --> 26:30.783
P... p... parachute?
I... I'd prefer

26:30.785 --> 26:33.151
- a more traditional landing.
- Yes, but the problem

26:33.153 --> 26:36.022
is that the region's only pilot
is in prison for smuggling.

26:36.024 --> 26:38.490
As you know,
Einstein once said,

26:38.492 --> 26:40.459
"If someone told me that
the world would come to an end

26:40.461 --> 26:43.729
"in one hour, I'd spend 55
minutes analyzing the situation

26:43.731 --> 26:45.732
and 5 minutes
to find the solution."

26:45.734 --> 26:47.766
We know the problem.
We don't have a pilot.

26:47.768 --> 26:50.873
Ahem.

26:56.978 --> 26:58.977
We've got a pantry
full of supplies!

26:58.979 --> 27:01.013
There's takaris,
a dal bhat, and churiyan.

27:01.015 --> 27:02.884
Whoa!

27:04.885 --> 27:08.286
Son, accomplish your mission
as did your father,

27:08.288 --> 27:11.290
your grandfather
and your great grandfather.

27:11.292 --> 27:14.127
I'm counting on you.

27:26.807 --> 27:28.807
All you have to do
is land on a plateau

27:28.809 --> 27:31.279
near the Menlung Glacier.

27:41.789 --> 27:44.791
Wow, it's beautiful!

27:49.797 --> 27:52.300
Nelly, look out!

27:54.302 --> 27:57.072
Whoa!

28:00.408 --> 28:02.408
- Oh!
- Nelly! You have

28:02.410 --> 28:04.409
- a pilot's licence, right?
- Close enough.

28:04.411 --> 28:07.045
I took the theory courses,
but I ran out of money

28:07.047 --> 28:09.114
for the actual flying lessons.

28:09.116 --> 28:11.119
Anyway, a diploma
doesn't make the pilot.

28:13.353 --> 28:15.356
So, let's get
down to business.

28:18.426 --> 28:21.026
What do you think
this symbol means?

28:21.028 --> 28:24.098
Scribbles, sahib.

28:27.434 --> 28:30.937
Excuse me, sahib, but we have
to decide where to land soon.

28:30.939 --> 28:34.306
We should steer
to the right, shouldn't we?

28:34.308 --> 28:37.011
It's very clear
we need to go left.

28:38.846 --> 28:41.080
I say we come back
when conditions improve,

28:41.082 --> 28:43.615
- With a real pilot!
- Don't worry,

28:43.617 --> 28:46.554
these are just clouds!

28:52.259 --> 28:56.798
- The wing flaps aren't working!
- We're going to crash!

28:58.632 --> 29:01.566
- Put this on!
- Quick! We've gotta jump!

29:01.568 --> 29:04.005
NO! I am in control
of this thing!

29:25.125 --> 29:27.126
Ah!

29:27.128 --> 29:29.428
Come on, you!

29:29.430 --> 29:31.898
Whoa!

29:31.900 --> 29:33.901
Whoa!

29:48.248 --> 29:50.649
Ow! Oh!

29:50.651 --> 29:52.651
I'd prefer a more

29:52.653 --> 29:55.521
traditional landing!

30:19.212 --> 30:21.213
SIMON!

30:21.215 --> 30:23.218
TENSING!

30:30.290 --> 30:32.190
Oh!

30:32.192 --> 30:36.361
Hm? Hm?

30:38.365 --> 30:41.235
The yeti!

30:45.238 --> 30:48.006
Guh!

30:48.008 --> 30:49.976
- Simon!
- Nelly!

30:52.080 --> 30:54.179
- Have you seen Tensing?
- No!

30:54.181 --> 30:57.283
- Yahoo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!
- Jazzmin! - Whoa!

30:57.285 --> 30:59.284
Bing. Bonk. Ooh.

30:59.286 --> 31:01.286
Sahibs!

31:01.288 --> 31:03.488
Tensing!

31:06.126 --> 31:08.060
- Ouch!
- Are you injured?

31:08.062 --> 31:10.095
It's my leg.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.100
It'll be as though

31:14.102 --> 31:16.369
you're on a leisurely cruise.

31:20.408 --> 31:22.507
Poor Tensing,
you unlucky fellow!

31:22.509 --> 31:24.642
Oh, you know.
Good luck or bad luck,

31:24.644 --> 31:26.746
it all depends
on how you see it.

31:26.748 --> 31:28.747
Injuring your leg
at 11 000 feet?

31:28.749 --> 31:30.749
- No way I'd call that good luck!
- Actually, I agree

31:30.751 --> 31:33.284
with Tensing. We're lucky to be
alive after a crash like that.

31:33.286 --> 31:35.286
If we'd been lucky,
we wouldn't have crashed!

31:35.288 --> 31:37.288
Not crashing wouldn't be
lucky, it wouldn't be anything

31:37.290 --> 31:40.458
- at all!
- I'll take nothing at all over your good luck any day.

31:40.460 --> 31:42.460
Do you really think
like that, or are you

31:42.462 --> 31:44.463
- just being unpleasant?
- <i>Que garne?</i>

31:44.465 --> 31:46.465
- <i>Que garne?</i>
- What? What's <i>que garne?</i>

31:46.467 --> 31:48.566
- What can we go?
- Nothing, unfortunately.

31:48.568 --> 31:51.303
Anyway, we'd better salvage

31:51.305 --> 31:54.407
our equipment before
it disappears under the snow.

31:56.411 --> 31:58.410
- Brrr!
- This weather is bad

31:58.412 --> 32:00.414
even for a yeti, isn't it?

32:04.052 --> 32:06.052
Ah.

32:06.054 --> 32:08.053
Have you found our provisions?

32:08.055 --> 32:10.055
Yes! We have food to eat!

32:10.057 --> 32:12.057
Well! Enough
of freezing outside.

32:12.059 --> 32:15.229
Let's go freeze inside
the cockpit. Come on, let's go.

32:17.230 --> 32:19.832
All we could find was bread
and hot peppers.

32:19.834 --> 32:22.501
You saved the peppers!
That's excellent!

32:22.503 --> 32:24.503
Reshampattis,

32:24.505 --> 32:26.505
byadagis and mirchis!

32:26.507 --> 32:28.474
Mmm!

32:28.476 --> 32:30.609
Try it, sahib. In this cold,

32:30.611 --> 32:33.646
- you need your strength.
- Mhm...

32:35.650 --> 32:38.083
Ahh!

32:44.825 --> 32:47.293
You are what you eat, sahibs.
If you eat

32:47.295 --> 32:49.294
something strong,
then you will become strong.

33:05.246 --> 33:07.313
This is Golf

33:07.315 --> 33:09.215
Tango Echo Mike. Golf Tango Echo

33:09.217 --> 33:12.817
Mike. Our plane has crashed.
We've had mechanical failure.

33:12.819 --> 33:14.820
One person injured.

33:14.822 --> 33:18.858
Position is latitude 27,
42 minutes, 4 seconds north,

33:18.860 --> 33:22.227
longitude 86 degrees,
25 minutes, 11 seconds east.

33:22.229 --> 33:24.229
Our morale is good.

33:24.231 --> 33:25.767
I repeat: our morale is good.

33:28.236 --> 33:31.669
With the mountains that are all around, our
signal might not get through to anybody!

33:31.671 --> 33:34.506
Nelly, the storm has blown us
way off course...

33:34.508 --> 33:37.176
- Are you sure about that?
- It would be wise to give up

33:37.178 --> 33:39.178
- on our mission.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

33:39.180 --> 33:41.179
It wouldn't. We didn't come
this far to give up so easily.

33:41.181 --> 33:43.181
- There's no way!
- Ow!

33:43.183 --> 33:45.751
- Sorry, Tensing!
- There. That's better.

33:47.889 --> 33:51.457
As Kipling once said,
"If you can keep your head

33:51.459 --> 33:53.726
when all about you are
losing theirs, and..."

33:56.163 --> 33:58.165
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

34:09.442 --> 34:12.342
OK. There's no food,

34:12.344 --> 34:14.478
we're way off course,
and Tensing's hurt.

34:14.481 --> 34:17.581
We cannot carry on like this.
We must alert the rescue team.

34:17.583 --> 34:19.585
You're right. From now on,

34:19.587 --> 34:21.819
we are in survival mode.
Don't waste time.

34:21.821 --> 34:24.522
If we want our messages
to reach the rescue squad,

34:24.524 --> 34:26.525
we'll need to get
to higher ground.

34:26.527 --> 34:28.426
There, to the south.
It's a two-day hike.

34:28.428 --> 34:30.328
Two days?!

34:32.899 --> 34:36.569
- What the heck are you doing?!
- Tensing! Which way is our landing site?

34:36.571 --> 34:39.538
- To the right!
- Nelly! The plane has no wings!

34:39.540 --> 34:41.540
Who needs wings
when you've got skis?

34:41.542 --> 34:44.710
Yeah ha!
Yeah ha! Yeah ha!

34:44.712 --> 34:47.279
What was that?

34:47.281 --> 34:49.650
The departure song!
It's a family tradition.

34:51.351 --> 34:53.719
Whoa...

34:55.723 --> 34:58.223
Did you learn these manoeuvers
in your theory class?

35:02.629 --> 35:04.765
You'll have to turn right,
Miss Nelly!

35:06.366 --> 35:08.701
This thing won't turn!

35:16.910 --> 35:20.011
- Nelly, cut the power!
- I tried!

35:20.013 --> 35:22.815
It won't respond! We've
gotta open up the panel!

35:22.817 --> 35:25.417
- I need a screwdriver! NOW!
- A screwdriver? - Hurry!

35:25.419 --> 35:27.419
No. No.

35:27.421 --> 35:29.687
No. No!

35:29.689 --> 35:32.793
Got it!

35:45.939 --> 35:47.906
Well, here we are!

35:51.011 --> 35:53.846
At least we made it up
to an elevation of 12 000 feet!

35:53.848 --> 35:55.748
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

35:55.750 --> 35:58.317
This is Golf Tango Echo Mike!

35:58.319 --> 36:00.419
Golf Tango Echo Mike!

36:00.421 --> 36:03.955
Immediate assistance
required! Over!

36:06.294 --> 36:08.964
OK, where are we now?

36:15.669 --> 36:17.002
What is that?

36:17.004 --> 36:20.004
Shi Mung, the great
Cantonese singer!

36:20.006 --> 36:22.440
Ah, I love it!

36:22.442 --> 36:25.044
I don't wanna
listen to your Shi Mung.

36:25.046 --> 36:27.379
I want someone to answer
our distress call!

36:27.381 --> 36:29.781
It's unlikely your calls
are getting through

36:29.783 --> 36:31.783
with all this static!

36:31.785 --> 36:33.618
This song's not bad.

36:35.489 --> 36:37.855
So, show me where we are.

36:37.857 --> 36:39.891
At the foot
of Menlung Glacier, I think.

36:39.893 --> 36:42.895
- Huh?!
- Did I hear right?

36:42.897 --> 36:44.696
So that

36:44.698 --> 36:48.000
is the Menlung Glacier,
where we'll find the yeti?

36:48.002 --> 36:50.435
Oh, well, uh...

36:50.437 --> 36:52.837
why don't we just see
if there's one hanging around?

36:52.839 --> 36:55.843
Yeah ha!
Yeah ha! Yeah ha!

36:58.511 --> 37:00.515
Oh, and bring the radio.

37:10.091 --> 37:13.058
I don't know what's worse:

37:13.060 --> 37:15.127
the biting cold
or the screeching Shi Mung?

37:20.835 --> 37:23.669
Tensing, you're making me
work up a sweat!

37:23.671 --> 37:28.940
Well, you don't hire a Sherpa
by the pound.

37:28.942 --> 37:32.877
There have been many deaths
on this glacier.

37:32.879 --> 37:35.950
That, I don't want to hear.

37:38.518 --> 37:40.518
Look at that!

37:40.520 --> 37:43.725
That's Mount Everest!

37:45.826 --> 37:49.060
Our people call it
Chomolungma.

37:49.062 --> 37:51.730
Cho... mo...
lu... ma.

37:51.732 --> 37:53.732
It means "earth mother."

37:53.734 --> 37:57.069
I really feel like
an intruder in this place.

37:57.071 --> 38:01.105
Yes. We all are, Miss Nelly.

38:01.107 --> 38:04.810
That's good. Perfect. Smile!
Try to look natural.

38:04.812 --> 38:06.812
Tensing, look at the camera.

38:06.814 --> 38:08.813
Nelly... oh, that's nice.
That's nice.

38:08.815 --> 38:10.815
OK, try a different pose.

38:10.817 --> 38:13.152
Relax! Look happy.

38:13.154 --> 38:15.154
Not too happy! That's perfect.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.159
Oh.

38:23.163 --> 38:25.466
I'm coming!

38:30.471 --> 38:32.474
Ah!

38:34.442 --> 38:36.574
Hm.

38:48.656 --> 38:50.522
Tensing can sleep
in the small tent.

38:50.524 --> 38:52.591
We'll put our supplies
in that tent and we'll share

38:52.593 --> 38:54.625
the big one. Do you sleep
left or right?

38:54.627 --> 38:56.930
Uh... right?

39:05.105 --> 39:07.806
- Tensing...
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

39:12.078 --> 39:14.946
OK, if this symbol
indicates the east,

39:14.948 --> 39:17.082
that means that this one
means north. Right!

39:17.084 --> 39:21.152
And then this number here
must mean distance... hm.

39:21.154 --> 39:23.922
Norton was British,
so he measured in feet. Right.

39:23.924 --> 39:25.757
And this drawing here is
a mountain peak:

39:25.759 --> 39:27.592
a sharp, high peak.

39:27.594 --> 39:29.862
And that's a... crevice.

39:29.864 --> 39:31.996
Or a V? A V for victory?

39:31.998 --> 39:34.799
Or is it a crevice for victory?
Yeah, not bad, that.

39:38.172 --> 39:41.976
Yeah ha! Yeah ha! Yeah ha!

39:44.078 --> 39:46.011
What was that?

39:46.013 --> 39:47.612
Yeah ha!

39:47.614 --> 39:49.915
Yeah ha! Yeah ha!

39:49.917 --> 39:51.917
That's his morning song,

39:51.919 --> 39:54.085
I suppose.

39:54.087 --> 39:56.587
According to my theory,

39:56.589 --> 39:58.589
if we walk 5 000 feet
to the northeast,

39:58.591 --> 40:00.993
we'll come
to a high mountain peak.

40:00.995 --> 40:03.094
Then, we'll see some jagged
rocks on the north face.

40:03.096 --> 40:06.565
If we stay on that path,
we'll end up in the yeti's lair.

40:06.567 --> 40:08.866
4 998,

40:08.868 --> 40:10.868
4 999,

40:10.870 --> 40:12.804
5 000! Hm?

40:12.806 --> 40:14.705
Right.

40:14.707 --> 40:16.708
It must be

40:16.710 --> 40:18.310
a secret lair.

40:18.312 --> 40:21.112
But we did climb
exactly 5 000 feet.

40:21.114 --> 40:23.047
I don't understand.

40:23.049 --> 40:24.852
Did you notice a high,
sharp mountain peak?

40:26.953 --> 40:30.187
Oh, my mistake!
It's not measured in feet,

40:30.189 --> 40:32.089
but in yards! And the V doesn't
mean a crevice.

40:32.091 --> 40:34.158
On the contrary, it's...
if you look at it,

40:34.160 --> 40:36.627
the V is at 45 degrees,
so it's a steep cliff.

40:36.629 --> 40:39.330
And what I thought was north
was west, and east was south.

40:39.332 --> 40:42.801
Well! Onwards and upwards!

41:11.265 --> 41:13.265
No trail.

41:13.267 --> 41:16.268
No yeti. No nothing.

41:16.270 --> 41:18.270
Not a single trace or clue

41:18.272 --> 41:20.272
on the horizon.

41:20.274 --> 41:22.741
- Take that!
- Hm?

41:22.743 --> 41:25.243
Stupid mountain.

41:25.245 --> 41:27.379
Hey!

41:27.381 --> 41:29.716
At least it's good
for something.

41:31.718 --> 41:33.752
OK, I think it's time for me

41:33.754 --> 41:36.989
to take a look at this thing.

41:36.991 --> 41:39.223
Oh, no!

41:39.225 --> 41:41.225
Yeow! Ha ha!

41:41.227 --> 41:43.161
Yeow!

41:43.163 --> 41:45.096
Vroom! Woop! Yeow!

41:45.098 --> 41:47.699
Go ahead, have a look
at it, too.

41:47.701 --> 41:50.701
I'll wait here.

41:52.872 --> 41:55.741
Alright Simon, keep your chin
up. We'll just rest a while,

41:55.743 --> 41:57.743
then we'll keep looking
'til we find your yeti!

41:57.745 --> 41:59.710
That's assuming they exist.

41:59.712 --> 42:03.015
Is anybody hungry?

42:03.017 --> 42:05.150
Oh! What if we tried luring it

42:05.152 --> 42:07.386
with a hot pepper sandwich?
What do you think? Huh?

42:07.388 --> 42:10.121
It wouldn't work.

42:10.123 --> 42:12.089
According to Shipton,
the yeti is a carnivore.

42:12.091 --> 42:14.393
- Huh?
- So, we don't know if the yeti

42:14.395 --> 42:16.761
exists, but we know
he's a carnivore.

42:16.763 --> 42:19.864
All the more for us!

42:19.866 --> 42:22.067
Reshampattis, byadagis, mirchis!

42:22.069 --> 42:24.138
I never wanna see
a hot pepper again.

42:27.908 --> 42:30.708
- Hey! Oh!
- Our peppers!

42:30.710 --> 42:32.710
Miss Nelly?

42:32.712 --> 42:35.013
Whoa!

42:39.252 --> 42:41.252
Get ready

42:41.254 --> 42:44.056
for the sleigh ride
of your life!

42:48.995 --> 42:50.995
- Ah!
- Whoa!

43:11.785 --> 43:13.984
Good work, cowboy!

43:13.986 --> 43:16.154
Yeah, what a rodeo!

43:21.227 --> 43:23.328
Did you hear that?
What is that?

43:23.330 --> 43:25.163
Sh! It's really close.

43:25.165 --> 43:27.035
It seems to have stopped.

43:29.902 --> 43:31.973
Then, uh, what's that?

44:03.402 --> 44:06.170
- Simon!
- What? - Look at this!

44:06.172 --> 44:09.107
There's food here! Canned goods,
chocolate, coffee!

44:09.109 --> 44:11.279
No more hot pepper sandwiches!

44:28.995 --> 44:31.328
Hm?

44:31.330 --> 44:33.734
George Madison!

44:35.535 --> 44:38.837
It worked! We followed
the right path!

44:41.274 --> 44:44.042
Tensing? You're walking.

44:44.044 --> 44:46.344
When did your foot get better?

44:46.346 --> 44:48.346
You were carrying me.
It's hard to say.

44:48.348 --> 44:50.348
Right, because you couldn't
put weight on it.

44:50.350 --> 44:52.216
- Yes, I know, but I can now.
- You're certain

44:52.218 --> 44:54.286
- it's safe to walk on it?
- Well, it's much safer

44:54.288 --> 44:57.388
than being carried
by the two of you.

45:03.897 --> 45:06.031
He deserves a proper burial.

45:06.033 --> 45:09.533
Sahib, come see this.

45:22.149 --> 45:24.518
His grandfather.

45:36.363 --> 45:38.395
We know they didn't
die of starvation.

45:42.602 --> 45:44.603
What if the yeti
attacked them?

45:44.605 --> 45:47.571
The mountain has a way
of settling her debts.

45:53.113 --> 45:55.880
Hey! What are you doing?

45:55.882 --> 45:57.649
If you need these,

45:57.651 --> 45:59.853
all you have to do is ask.

46:01.989 --> 46:04.455
Perfect!

46:04.457 --> 46:07.292
This was once held by Madison.

46:07.294 --> 46:11.596
- At least this one is readable.
- Listen.

46:11.598 --> 46:14.266
"June 10th, 1924.

46:14.268 --> 46:18.136
"For 10 days now, my companions
and I have been surrounded

46:18.138 --> 46:20.337
"by a landscape
that is endlessly transformed

46:20.339 --> 46:23.343
by wind and snow storms."

46:29.382 --> 46:32.083
<i>"Weariness and despondency
have descended upon my men.</i>

46:32.085 --> 46:34.518
<i>"Are they... possessed</i>

46:34.520 --> 46:36.520
<i>"by the spirits whose voices</i>

46:36.522 --> 46:38.522
<i>"echo through the mountains?</i>

46:38.524 --> 46:40.357
<i>"I don't know.</i>

46:40.359 --> 46:43.228
<i>"Madness has taken each of them,</i>

46:43.230 --> 46:45.230
<i>"and is now waiting at my door.</i>

46:45.232 --> 46:48.933
<i>"Nothing will save me. Norton
himself disappeared last night</i>

46:48.935 --> 46:51.201
<i>"after losing his mind,</i>

46:51.203 --> 46:54.205
<i>"leaving me here... alone.</i>

46:54.207 --> 46:57.241
<i>"I am already dead,</i>

46:57.243 --> 47:00.511
<i>"forever wandering
in the icy shadows of eternity,</i>

47:00.513 --> 47:03.214
<i>"ready to haunt those who are...</i>

47:03.216 --> 47:06.554
foolish enough
to follow in our footsteps."

47:11.190 --> 47:14.192
That was the last thing
he wrote.

47:14.194 --> 47:16.060
Do you think
Madison and his men

47:16.062 --> 47:18.429
were overcome
by some evil power?

47:18.431 --> 47:20.332
My father told stories
about mountain spirits.

47:20.334 --> 47:22.232
The mountain spirits?

48:07.279 --> 48:10.281
No, don't!

48:13.219 --> 48:17.589
Stop shooting, Miss Nelly!
It's dangerous!

48:17.591 --> 48:19.757
The spirits are everywhere!

48:19.759 --> 48:21.792
Do something, sahib!

48:21.794 --> 48:24.062
We're doomed! Like Madison!

48:31.238 --> 48:33.605
Oh, look out!

48:36.609 --> 48:40.247
Hm?

48:50.656 --> 48:53.158
TENSING?

48:53.160 --> 48:55.092
Tensing?

48:55.094 --> 48:57.529
Miss Nelly? Are you OK?

48:57.531 --> 48:59.397
I think so. And you?

48:59.399 --> 49:01.232
I'm fine. And you, sahib?

49:01.234 --> 49:03.671
- Are you OK?
- I could be worse.

49:06.239 --> 49:08.672
I don't know
what came over me.

49:11.678 --> 49:14.080
Tensing, throw me some light.

49:16.116 --> 49:18.415
It's of no use, sahib.

49:18.417 --> 49:21.419
There are tons of them.

49:21.421 --> 49:24.556
I think we should be outside,
searching for the yeti,

49:24.558 --> 49:27.225
eating hot peppers
and getting frozen feet!

49:27.227 --> 49:30.428
And instead, we're prisoners inside
a mountain... AH!

49:30.430 --> 49:33.098
For sure this is
a bit of bad luck.

49:33.100 --> 49:35.199
But as you know,
good luck or bad luck...

49:35.201 --> 49:38.435
Not this time, Tensing.
It's over.

49:38.437 --> 49:41.105
Hm? Oops.

49:41.107 --> 49:43.373
- Batteries are dead, sahib.
- Great!

49:43.375 --> 49:47.511
That's all we need. I can't take
any more! Just leave me alone.

49:47.513 --> 49:49.647
And where would you
like us to go?

49:49.649 --> 49:51.516
Come on, Miss Nelly.

49:51.518 --> 49:53.384
Let's go explore the cave.

49:59.792 --> 50:01.796
Ow!

50:05.866 --> 50:08.069
Ow!

50:12.205 --> 50:14.208
OW!

50:16.143 --> 50:18.143
Ow!

50:20.147 --> 50:23.250
OK, we have three matches left.
I can't mess up.

50:25.252 --> 50:27.587
Sorry about my behaviour. I...
shouldn't've lost it like that.

50:29.589 --> 50:32.357
- Diary.
- Norton's diary? What for?

50:32.359 --> 50:34.359
- Diary!
- OK!

50:34.361 --> 50:36.794
Sure. Here.

50:36.796 --> 50:39.830
What are you doing?!

50:39.832 --> 50:42.833
We only have two matches.
And keep your voice down!

50:48.440 --> 50:51.275
So, now where do we go?

50:51.277 --> 50:53.911
My intuition says
to... go right.

50:53.913 --> 50:55.913
That's great!
Then we'll go left.

50:55.915 --> 50:57.915
- Left?
- I saw what you did

50:57.917 --> 50:59.917
in the plane. If you say right,
it means we should go left.

50:59.919 --> 51:03.420
That's precisely the reason
I said "right." I meant left.

51:03.422 --> 51:06.524
Fine. But, if you were
thinking left, yet said,

51:06.526 --> 51:10.194
"Go right," which led us to go left,
then logic says we should go right.

51:10.196 --> 51:12.362
Come on. We're going left.

51:12.364 --> 51:14.468
Hm!

51:17.904 --> 51:20.638
Do you hear that?

51:20.640 --> 51:22.906
- Ouch!
- Shh!

51:22.908 --> 51:24.975
Here!

51:30.450 --> 51:32.449
Ugh!

51:32.451 --> 51:34.455
Give me that.

51:37.357 --> 51:39.727
Hm!

51:41.794 --> 51:44.429
Well, look at that!

51:59.446 --> 52:01.446
Look!

52:01.448 --> 52:03.917
Hm!

52:11.357 --> 52:13.391
Hm?

52:13.393 --> 52:16.297
Hm?

52:24.437 --> 52:26.640
Nelly, come on!

52:50.497 --> 52:54.000
Huh?

52:57.002 --> 53:00.004
Hm...

53:00.006 --> 53:01.538
Wait.

53:01.540 --> 53:03.373
Wait, is it?

53:03.375 --> 53:05.042
Could it be?

53:05.044 --> 53:07.045
It is!

53:07.047 --> 53:10.348
This is it! We found it!
Look at this!

53:10.350 --> 53:12.917
NELLY! We found the yeti!

53:12.919 --> 53:15.520
We now have proof it exists!

53:15.522 --> 53:17.587
NELLY?

53:17.589 --> 53:19.593
Come see this, sahib.

53:24.464 --> 53:26.730
It's her cap.

53:26.732 --> 53:28.669
The yeti took her?

53:31.103 --> 53:33.103
I thought yeti were
afraid of humans!

53:33.105 --> 53:35.605
You'll have to revise
your theory, sahib!

53:39.812 --> 53:42.379
Hm. OK. Which way
should we go?

53:42.381 --> 53:44.482
Hard to say.

53:44.484 --> 53:46.884
I know! Let's do
what Nelly would do!

53:46.886 --> 53:49.120
Yes! We have to think
like she does...

53:49.122 --> 53:51.355
...and do
the exact opposite!

53:51.357 --> 53:53.424
Hm...

53:53.426 --> 53:56.861
She'd track her prey.

53:56.863 --> 53:59.397
- Good thinking, sahib.
- So, what is the opposite

53:59.399 --> 54:01.632
- of tracking one's prey?
- Attracting it.

54:01.634 --> 54:03.634
Then we'll
attract our prey! Now...

54:03.636 --> 54:05.737
How do we attract the yeti?

54:05.739 --> 54:08.373
Got it! One of us hides
while the other serves as bait.

54:08.375 --> 54:11.676
And... who will serve as bait?

54:11.678 --> 54:13.544
The one with the most meat
on him.

54:13.546 --> 54:15.513
Oh, no. The bait has to be
the one who runs the fastest.

54:15.515 --> 54:17.415
I'm the oldest in the group.
I run the operation.

54:17.417 --> 54:19.420
- You're the bait.
- I have a better idea.

54:26.426 --> 54:29.063
Hm?

54:40.672 --> 54:42.672
This is fabulous! He's enormous!

54:42.674 --> 54:44.908
Not at all
what I thought he'd be!

54:44.910 --> 54:46.911
Move over, Tensing!
You're in my frame!

55:05.832 --> 55:08.533
Whoa!

55:14.540 --> 55:17.641
Tensing! There's
an entire tribe of them!

55:17.643 --> 55:19.544
A village...

55:19.546 --> 55:23.214
full of yeti!

55:23.216 --> 55:25.585
There's Nelly!

55:28.053 --> 55:30.054
Ooh!

55:33.125 --> 55:34.727
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!

55:35.928 --> 55:37.895
Uh... Nelly Maloye,
private detective.

55:37.897 --> 55:39.897
"Intuition in service
of the truth."

55:39.899 --> 55:43.770
She never quits.

55:46.772 --> 55:48.739
Look!

55:56.616 --> 55:58.716
We have to get her
out of there.

55:58.718 --> 56:00.585
Wait 'til nightfall.

56:00.587 --> 56:02.487
The yeti will be asleep.

56:18.671 --> 56:21.739
What do you think, Tensing?
Will they turn in soon?

56:30.015 --> 56:32.016
Look up there!

56:32.018 --> 56:34.118
The snow!

56:48.968 --> 56:51.101
Ah ha! Ha ha!

56:51.103 --> 56:53.304
Ha! AH!

57:19.031 --> 57:22.033
Making snow fall on the fire
was an excellent idea, sahib.

57:22.035 --> 57:23.870
Dear Nelly...

57:26.306 --> 57:28.573
Run for safety
while there's still time.

57:28.575 --> 57:31.808
For me... the road ends here.

57:31.810 --> 57:34.178
We all have to leave

57:34.180 --> 57:35.612
before the yeti find us!

57:35.614 --> 57:37.781
Too late for me. You go.

57:37.783 --> 57:40.317
I'll do what I can
to distract them.

57:40.319 --> 57:42.319
Spread the good news
to the whole world...

57:42.321 --> 57:44.589
and tell the university

57:44.591 --> 57:46.593
I'd be honoured if they named
a scholarship after me.

57:49.294 --> 57:51.795
They're coming!

57:51.797 --> 57:54.065
I saw my life

57:54.067 --> 57:56.067
flash before me in slow motion!

58:37.743 --> 58:39.743
Huh? Hello, little guy!

58:52.190 --> 58:54.727
No, don't move!

59:01.067 --> 59:02.736
No, no, no, no, no!
It isn't what you think!

59:12.210 --> 59:14.210
Hold on!

59:21.154 --> 59:23.156
Tensing!

59:25.223 --> 59:27.824
Hm? Hm? Hm?

59:34.834 --> 59:36.833
Uh, you see,

59:36.835 --> 59:38.969
he climbed up
the tree and, uh...

01:00:11.236 --> 01:00:13.837
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Enough.

01:00:13.839 --> 01:00:16.440
Ignore them.

01:00:16.442 --> 01:00:18.442
I can't help it.
Seeing yetis laugh

01:00:18.444 --> 01:00:20.781
makes me want to laugh too!

01:00:23.348 --> 01:00:25.482
Hey! That's it!
That's the proof!

01:00:25.484 --> 01:00:27.484
- What?
- The missing link!

01:00:27.486 --> 01:00:29.487
- Huh?
- They say laughter is unique

01:00:29.489 --> 01:00:33.390
- to humans, right?
- Uh, yes...

01:00:33.392 --> 01:00:36.359
- But these yeti are laughing!
- Are they ever!

01:00:36.361 --> 01:00:38.495
So, that proves their
connection to the human species!

01:00:38.497 --> 01:00:41.297
Would you call that
scientific evidence?

01:00:41.299 --> 01:00:43.266
Well, as much
as Newton's apple was.

01:00:50.308 --> 01:00:52.342
We have made contact
with the yeti!

01:00:52.344 --> 01:00:54.178
That's promising!

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.179
I'll be able
to study them in-depth!

01:01:00.085 --> 01:01:02.085
Uh, what?

01:01:07.926 --> 01:01:09.926
They want us
to leave their land

01:01:09.928 --> 01:01:12.029
and leave them alone.
It looks like

01:01:12.031 --> 01:01:14.031
they're pretty serious
about that.

01:01:16.169 --> 01:01:18.169
Come on, Simon. Let's go.

01:01:18.171 --> 01:01:20.069
They're giving us
a chance to leave in peace.

01:01:20.071 --> 01:01:22.071
But...

01:01:22.073 --> 01:01:24.174
Fine.

01:01:46.198 --> 01:01:48.132
My friends, the contents

01:01:48.134 --> 01:01:49.770
of this box
will change the world!

01:01:52.171 --> 01:01:54.170
In a few days,
we'll be back in Kathmandu.

01:01:54.172 --> 01:01:57.607
Our discovery will be recognized by
the most prestigious universities!

01:01:57.609 --> 01:02:00.578
Tensing, you'll be
the most famous guide

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:02.913
on the planet!
You're grandfather

01:02:02.915 --> 01:02:04.982
would be so proud of you!
And you, Nelly!

01:02:04.984 --> 01:02:06.984
Your phone will
ring off the hook!

01:02:06.986 --> 01:02:09.453
Scotland Yard, Interpol: you'll
get to pick what you want!

01:02:09.455 --> 01:02:11.589
We're leaving now,

01:02:11.591 --> 01:02:13.591
but we'll be back.
Right, Tensing?

01:02:13.593 --> 01:02:15.592
With better equipment
and better prepared.

01:02:46.225 --> 01:02:48.228
Huh?

01:03:12.350 --> 01:03:15.351
It's incredible
that despite all the bad luck

01:03:15.353 --> 01:03:17.353
we had, we still managed
to find the yeti.

01:03:17.355 --> 01:03:20.257
In fact, it was
your so-called "bad luck"

01:03:20.259 --> 01:03:22.362
that made it possible for you
to find your yeti, sahib.

01:03:24.529 --> 01:03:27.698
Simon, in your opinion, what
do you think will happen once

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:29.699
- you announce your discovery?
- The news will spread like

01:03:29.701 --> 01:03:33.469
- wildfire!
- And everybody will wanna get a glimpse of the yeti.

01:03:33.471 --> 01:03:36.073
Shall I tell you
how the story ends?

- Don't exaggerate.
- I don't know, sahib.

01:04:45.143 --> 01:04:47.143
- I don't know.
- We will get all the glory:

01:04:47.145 --> 01:04:49.545
great offers, new projects,
but it's the yeti

01:04:49.547 --> 01:04:51.547
- that will pay the price.
- But we'll be around.

01:04:51.549 --> 01:04:53.549
If there's abuse, we'll
intervene! You know that!

01:04:53.551 --> 01:04:55.786
How? We won't be able

01:04:55.788 --> 01:04:57.788
- to stop it!
- Why not? We discovered

01:04:57.790 --> 01:05:01.658
the yeti! Many people dreamed of
doing just that, but we did it!

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:04.261
You think it's alright
for the yeti, who have

01:05:04.263 --> 01:05:06.629
survived this long,
to end up as circus animals?

01:05:06.631 --> 01:05:10.033
We should just let them live in peace.

01:05:10.035 --> 01:05:12.736
<i>We're looking

01:05:12.738 --> 01:05:14.737

01:05:19.344 --> 01:05:22.549
Mayday, mayday, mayday! Rescue

01:05:25.317 --> 01:05:27.717
There! Up there,
we'll have a better chance!

01:05:27.719 --> 01:05:31.087
Mayday, mayday, mayday! Rescue
Flight Alpha! Can you hear me?

01:05:33.091 --> 01:05:35.091
- Hey, whoa!
- Sorry!

01:05:35.093 --> 01:05:37.527
Our position is latitude
27 degrees, 57 minutes

01:05:37.529 --> 01:05:39.562
and 10 seconds north. Longitude

01:05:39.564 --> 01:05:41.632

01:05:49.107 --> 01:05:51.107
What's he saying?
What's he saying?

01:05:53.446 --> 01:05:57.147
<i>This is Édouard Martineau
Junior! We have located you!</i>

01:05:57.149 --> 01:05:59.482
- <i>Have you found the yeti?</i>
- A complete tribe!

01:05:59.484 --> 01:06:02.152
- It was wonderful!
- <i>Did you get them on film?</i>

01:06:02.154 --> 01:06:04.154
- One full reel of film!
- Ahem!

01:06:04.156 --> 01:06:06.255
The images are won... derf...

01:06:06.257 --> 01:06:08.257
Can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

01:06:08.259 --> 01:06:10.259
Too much static.
Battery is weak.

01:06:10.261 --> 01:06:12.598
I'm cutting communications.

01:06:22.373 --> 01:06:24.373
Hello, my friends!

01:06:24.375 --> 01:06:27.310
Oh! Wait 'til Mama hears this!

01:06:27.312 --> 01:06:30.147
I met with a representative

01:06:30.149 --> 01:06:32.149
from Pan American Films.

01:06:32.151 --> 01:06:34.118
They want to produce
a big-budget movie

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.886
about our most
extraordinary adventure!

01:06:36.888 --> 01:06:39.823
Is that me?!

01:06:39.825 --> 01:06:41.859
Well, that's
a strange reaction.

01:06:41.861 --> 01:06:43.861
Oh, of course!

01:06:43.863 --> 01:06:45.862
You think the press
will be all over me!

01:06:45.864 --> 01:06:49.565
Don't worry. When I'm asked if I
did it alone, I'll tell them...

01:06:49.567 --> 01:06:52.803
A great man's best asset is
the people he has around him.

01:06:52.805 --> 01:06:55.404
Your name will be
in all of the history books,

01:06:55.406 --> 01:06:57.406
right next to mine. Just like...

01:06:57.408 --> 01:06:59.308
oh, what's-his-name
and Christopher Columbus.

01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:01.545
Oh! I've just reserved

01:07:01.547 --> 01:07:03.679
the Cavendish Hotel
for the press conference.

01:07:03.681 --> 01:07:06.319
Noon tomorrow,
the whole world will know!

01:07:08.319 --> 01:07:11.187
Listen, uh... I think we need
to think about this a while.

01:07:11.189 --> 01:07:13.190
It's all thought out,
my friend.

01:07:13.192 --> 01:07:15.324
You've done your job;
I'll do the rest.

01:07:15.326 --> 01:07:17.464
I financed your mission,
don't forget.

01:07:19.297 --> 01:07:20.931
What are you doing?!

01:07:20.933 --> 01:07:23.400
Simon, it's now or never!

01:07:23.402 --> 01:07:26.236
Give me that!

01:07:26.238 --> 01:07:28.504
No!

01:07:28.506 --> 01:07:30.940
Don't do this! NO!

01:07:30.942 --> 01:07:33.745
NELLY!

01:07:35.647 --> 01:07:38.415
NELLY!

01:07:38.417 --> 01:07:40.250
Please, help me!

01:07:40.252 --> 01:07:42.255
I've got you.

01:07:45.323 --> 01:07:47.891
Miss Nelly!

01:07:47.893 --> 01:07:49.792
Are you there?

01:07:49.794 --> 01:07:52.596
No one could survive

01:07:52.598 --> 01:07:55.364
- such a fall from up here.
- Huh?

01:07:55.366 --> 01:07:57.567
Well, alright. Let's go.
Quite obviously,

01:07:57.569 --> 01:07:59.569
there's nothing we can do here.

01:07:59.571 --> 01:08:02.741
Go without us.

01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:07.544
Descend slowly along the side
of the cliff, sahib.

01:08:07.546 --> 01:08:10.647
That's right. Short bounds.

01:08:17.323 --> 01:08:19.755
Whoa!

01:08:23.562 --> 01:08:25.828
NELLY!

01:08:33.572 --> 01:08:35.571
Rescue Alpha!

01:08:37.576 --> 01:08:39.875
Ah! Ah! Ah!

01:08:39.877 --> 01:08:41.880
Jazzmin...

01:08:45.017 --> 01:08:48.718
HELLO? DOWN HERE!

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:51.787
- Nelly?
- Simon?

01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:53.788
- Are you injured?
- I don't think so!

01:08:53.791 --> 01:08:57.393
- Where are you?
- Tensing! Nelly is alive!

01:08:57.395 --> 01:08:59.996
Lower me a little further.

01:08:59.997 --> 01:09:02.832
Impossible, sahib.
There is no more rope.

01:09:02.835 --> 01:09:05.535
Nelly, can you climb
your way out?

01:09:05.537 --> 01:09:08.938
There's ice everywhere!
I'll never make it!

01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:11.674
- Stand back! I'll cut the rope!
- No!

01:09:11.676 --> 01:09:14.410
- You won't be able to get out!
- We'll see.

01:09:14.412 --> 01:09:16.412
Tensing!

01:09:16.415 --> 01:09:19.749
- I'm going down to Nelly.
- No, sahib!

01:09:19.751 --> 01:09:22.785
Simon, did you
recover the film?

01:09:22.787 --> 01:09:25.587
- No. Édouard flew off with it.
- We have to stop him!

01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:27.390
We have to save the yetis!

01:09:27.393 --> 01:09:29.392
First, let's save you,

01:09:29.394 --> 01:09:31.761
then we'll save the yeti. Now...

01:09:42.407 --> 01:09:44.276
You?!

01:09:48.746 --> 01:09:51.548
I... have... to... get...
out... of... here.

01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:54.051
You... and... your... family...
are... at... risk.

01:09:54.053 --> 01:09:56.419
In... great... danger!

01:09:56.421 --> 01:09:58.088
Do you understand?

01:09:58.090 --> 01:10:01.357
No.

01:10:01.359 --> 01:10:04.328
Hm? Hm...

01:10:15.474 --> 01:10:17.473
Nelly?

01:10:17.475 --> 01:10:19.875
Where's Nelly?

01:10:19.877 --> 01:10:23.012
I... have...
to... find... Nelly.

01:10:23.014 --> 01:10:25.449
You... have... to... help... me.

01:10:28.086 --> 01:10:30.986
Hm. Hm?

01:10:36.595 --> 01:10:38.665
Whoa!

01:10:42.667 --> 01:10:44.804
Whoa...

01:10:48.573 --> 01:10:52.476
Have... you... seen...
my... friends?

01:11:22.507 --> 01:11:24.408
Where's Tensing?

01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:27.410
He's still up top.
He'll be better off without us.

01:12:17.996 --> 01:12:21.030
I hope my instructions are
clear, my good man.

01:12:21.032 --> 01:12:23.933
The contents in that canister
are of the highest importance.

01:12:23.935 --> 01:12:25.802
As clear as a bell, sir.

01:12:25.804 --> 01:12:27.870
Once the film's been developed,
I'll deliver it

01:12:27.872 --> 01:12:29.739
to the Cavendish Hotel.

01:12:29.741 --> 01:12:31.644
- Before noon!
- Thank you!

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.521
- <i>Dhanyabad!</i>
- <i>Namaste!</i>

01:12:44.523 --> 01:12:46.755
- No, it's <i>dhanyabad.</i>
- Uh, no. <i>Namaste.</i>

01:12:46.757 --> 01:12:48.691
- No, it's <i>dhanyabad.</i>
- No, it's <i>namaste.</i>

01:12:48.693 --> 01:12:50.560
- In this case, it's <i>dhanyabad.</i>
- No.

01:12:50.562 --> 01:12:52.765
Nelly, follow me!

01:12:55.132 --> 01:12:57.804
Come on, get on!

01:12:59.804 --> 01:13:02.672
Uh, Simon? We're in a hurry.

01:13:25.796 --> 01:13:27.797
Hm. Interesting film, sir.

01:13:27.799 --> 01:13:29.533
Thanks. Will you
run the projector?

01:13:29.535 --> 01:13:31.968
- Mhm.
- Perfect! Get to it.

01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:35.070
I'd like to see the film
before the journalists do.

01:13:35.072 --> 01:13:38.008
Come on, come on!

01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:40.877
- Oh, dear.
- NO!

01:13:40.879 --> 01:13:42.878
No!

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.815
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:13:45.817 --> 01:13:48.852
What, chief?

01:13:51.889 --> 01:13:54.290
Are you the explorer?

01:13:54.292 --> 01:13:57.694
Yes! I discovered the yetis.

01:14:02.568 --> 01:14:04.567
Cavendish Hotel?

01:14:04.569 --> 01:14:06.572
Ah, <i>dhanyabad!</i>

01:14:11.609 --> 01:14:14.013
<i>Namaste!</i>

01:14:20.618 --> 01:14:22.921
Mm. Hm!

01:14:25.623 --> 01:14:27.960
Mhm!

01:14:31.697 --> 01:14:34.931
Sorry about our appearance.

01:14:34.933 --> 01:14:38.735
Thank you for coming out
in such large numbers!

01:14:38.737 --> 01:14:41.804
Before I show you
my exceptional footage,

01:14:41.806 --> 01:14:43.673
I would like
to dedicate

01:14:43.675 --> 01:14:45.342
the discovery of the yeti
to my loyal assistants,

01:14:45.344 --> 01:14:48.210
Nelly Maloye and Simon Picard,

01:14:48.212 --> 01:14:51.213
who gave their lives
for science.

01:14:51.215 --> 01:14:54.017
I know Nelly and Simon would
have wanted no better

01:14:54.019 --> 01:14:57.657
resting place than that of
the majestic... Dim Sum Glacier.

01:15:02.728 --> 01:15:04.893
We've been in the mountains.

01:15:04.895 --> 01:15:07.062
We were part of the expedition.

01:15:07.064 --> 01:15:09.199
Édouard Martineau's?

01:15:09.201 --> 01:15:11.401
Édouard Martineau II!

01:15:11.403 --> 01:15:14.270
- Never mind!
- My life

01:15:14.272 --> 01:15:16.673
has been guided
by my love of animals.

01:15:16.675 --> 01:15:18.674
When I was eight,

01:15:18.676 --> 01:15:21.143
my father gave me my first pony.

01:15:27.885 --> 01:15:30.887
Hm...

01:15:33.190 --> 01:15:35.091
That's one heck of a beast!

01:15:39.096 --> 01:15:41.297
My parents were
always travelling,

01:15:41.299 --> 01:15:44.100
and I learned
that an animal's love is life's

01:15:44.102 --> 01:15:45.935
- most precious gift...
- Hey, Mr. Pony! You gonna

01:15:45.937 --> 01:15:49.138
- show us your yeti or not?
- Uh, well, I...

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:52.142
Yeti! Yeti! Yeti!

01:15:52.144 --> 01:15:54.280
Yeti!

01:16:05.991 --> 01:16:07.990
Huh?

01:16:15.332 --> 01:16:18.168
A mission chief must know
how to inspire his team

01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:21.303
to surpass themselves.
Here, you see our adventurers

01:16:21.305 --> 01:16:23.906
with Sherpa,
our famous mountain guide.

01:16:23.908 --> 01:16:26.875
They slowly make progress,

01:16:26.877 --> 01:16:30.079
determined to scale
the highest mountain range

01:16:30.081 --> 01:16:33.383
in the world! One of the most
perilous adventures

01:16:33.385 --> 01:16:35.718
- since Tutankhamen!
- Turn it off!

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.721
The matinee is over!

01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:39.755
- Go home, people!
- What's goin' on?

01:16:49.934 --> 01:16:52.735
- What's going on here?
- Hold on tight, Simon!

01:16:52.737 --> 01:16:55.204
Hey!

01:16:55.206 --> 01:16:58.173
Cut it out!

01:16:58.175 --> 01:17:01.343
- Hey! I thought you guys were dead!
- I beg your pardon!

01:17:01.345 --> 01:17:04.250
- Hey, look! It's a yeti!
- Huh?

01:17:21.332 --> 01:17:24.534
This is the dumbest hoax
I've seen in my life!

01:17:24.536 --> 01:17:27.469
- Who do you think you are?
- Go back to where

01:17:27.471 --> 01:17:30.809
- you came from! Get out of here!
- Charlatan! - Phony!

01:17:36.413 --> 01:17:39.785
No, wait! Please stay!

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:45.487
Tensing.

01:17:45.489 --> 01:17:48.057
Looks like
the press conference was

01:17:48.059 --> 01:17:50.058
a smashing success!

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:52.061
Tensing!

01:17:55.065 --> 01:17:57.467
Charlatan! Impostor!

01:17:57.469 --> 01:18:00.139
Charlatan! Impostor!

01:18:01.973 --> 01:18:04.941
You know what, Tensing?
You're a hero.

01:18:04.943 --> 01:18:07.944
- And one heck of an actor!
- Oh, no.

01:18:07.946 --> 01:18:09.945
I disagree.
He's a terrible actor. Did you

01:18:09.947 --> 01:18:12.015
see him as a yeti? Please!

01:18:12.017 --> 01:18:15.487
Tensing...

01:18:29.934 --> 01:18:32.000
<i>Namaste!</i>

01:18:32.002 --> 01:18:34.005
- <i>Namaste!</i>
- <i>Namaste!</i>

01:18:37.908 --> 01:18:39.942
Father,

01:18:39.944 --> 01:18:42.177
this is for you.

01:18:47.385 --> 01:18:50.222
So is this.

01:18:57.028 --> 01:18:59.027
Today, our son has

01:18:59.029 --> 01:19:02.367
heroically finished the mission
started by our ancestors.

01:19:04.368 --> 01:19:06.401
Oh, if your grandfather were
still here,

01:19:06.403 --> 01:19:10.405
he would be so proud of this
great accomplishment of yours.

01:19:26.190 --> 01:19:28.193
For you, sir.

01:19:41.672 --> 01:19:45.508
<i>Dear Professor, I thought
the faculty would be proud</i>

01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:47.343
<i>to display this in the museum.</i>

01:19:47.345 --> 01:19:49.445
<i>Thank you for the challenge.</i>

01:19:49.447 --> 01:19:51.446
<i>Simon Picard.</i>

01:19:51.448 --> 01:19:53.682
Hm...

01:20:08.366 --> 01:20:11.366
I've decided

01:20:11.368 --> 01:20:13.371
that I don't want
to be a professor after all.

01:20:15.206 --> 01:20:17.640
Oh, no? What will you do
instead? For a living?

01:20:17.642 --> 01:20:20.142
I'm not sure.
I like my new life!

01:20:20.144 --> 01:20:23.178
Hm.

01:20:25.183 --> 01:20:27.350
Is that the island
of Madagascar?

01:20:27.352 --> 01:20:30.055
No. It isn't big enough
to be Madagascar.

01:20:32.056 --> 01:20:34.057
Looks like smoke
in the distance!

01:20:34.059 --> 01:20:37.060
Hang on! There isn't supposed
to be an island there.

01:20:37.062 --> 01:20:39.027
I've never seen one on a map.

01:20:39.029 --> 01:20:41.332
- You serious?
- It's a mystery!

01:20:43.367 --> 01:20:45.368
- Come on!
- Whoa!

01:20:45.370 --> 01:20:47.971
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:20:47.973 --> 01:20:51.374
Uh! Yeah ha! Yeah ha!
Yeah ha! Whoa!

01:20:57.681 --> 01:20:59.615
Bring back my lifeboat,
you bunch of pirates!

01:20:59.617 --> 01:21:04.654
Bring back my life boat!

01:24:13.912 --> 01:24:16.344
I miss the yetis.
How 'bout you?

01:24:16.346 --> 01:24:18.347
I don't know!
They laugh

01:24:18.349 --> 01:24:20.652
about the strangest things.

01:24:20.654 --> 01:24:25.654
