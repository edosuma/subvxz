BUT IF YOU THINK I'M NOT SERIOUS
ABOUT THE DECORATING,

07:54.707 --> 07:55.641
YOU'RE WRONG!

07:55.708 --> 07:57.376
- WANDA, WILL YOU HELP US?

07:57.443 --> 07:58.945
- I'M SORRY, SPORT.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.147
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
WITH THIS PLAN.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.348
IT LOOKS LIKE JORGEN'S

08:02.415 --> 08:04.183
JUST GONNA HAVE TO
LIVE HERE FOREVER.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.618
- BY THE WAY, WANDA,

08:05.685 --> 08:08.754
I USED YOUR TOOTHBRUSH
TO CLEAN THE GUNK FROM MY BOOTS.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.357
- OKAY, I'M IN.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.992
- THIS IS ME GUARDING THE RULES.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.193
THIS IS ME GUARDING THE RULES

08:14.260 --> 08:16.462
IN VARIOUS TIGHT-FITTING
OUTFITS.

08:16.529 --> 08:19.065
I COULD ADMIRE
MY HOT LATIN LOOKS ALL DAY,

08:19.131 --> 08:22.034
BUT I MUST FOCUS ON MY JOB.

08:22.101 --> 08:24.770
-<i> BUENOS NACHOS!</i>

08:24.837 --> 08:26.906
- YOU JUST SAID,
"GOOD NACHOS."

08:26.973 --> 08:28.641
OH, WANDA!

08:28.708 --> 08:29.809
MY BEAUTY QUEEN!

08:29.876 --> 08:30.810
[sniffing]

08:30.877 --> 08:32.812
YOU SMELL SO <i> DELICIOSO.</i>

08:32.879 --> 08:34.679
- IT'S EAU DE TACO,

08:34.746 --> 08:36.682
YOUR FAVORITE,
IF I RECALL.

08:36.749 --> 08:38.183
<i>PAVO LOCO!</i>

08:38.251 --> 08:40.753
- I LOVE IT WHEN YOU CALL ME
YOUR CRAZY TURKEY.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.389
IS THAT FROSTBITE
ON YOUR TOES?

08:43.456 --> 08:45.224
I FIND IT VERY APPEALING.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.859
- YOU'RE SO SILLY.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.194
- [grunts]

08:48.261 --> 08:49.862
HOLY GUACAMOLE!

08:49.929 --> 08:51.964
IF I DID NOT KNOW ANY BETTER,

08:52.031 --> 08:54.367
I WOULD SAY YOUR FAN
HAD A TIRE IRON IN IT.

08:54.433 --> 08:56.602
- OH, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

08:56.669 --> 08:59.171
-<i> MI QUERIDA,</i>
WHY HAVE YOU COME TO SEE ME?

08:59.238 --> 09:03.075
- I'M, UH, SUDDENLY ATTRACTED
TO MEN WITH POWER.

09:03.142 --> 09:06.579
NOW, HOW ABOUT YOU JOIN ME
OVER THERE,

09:06.646 --> 09:08.848
AWAY FROM THE WISH MONITORS?

09:08.915 --> 09:12.018
- YES, BECAUSE IT'S
FAR MORE ROMANTIC OVER THERE

09:12.084 --> 09:14.253
BY THAT PIPE THAT LEADS
FROM THE TOILET.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.355
[alarm beeps]

09:16.422 --> 09:17.390
- OKAY, COSMO.

09:17.456 --> 09:19.058
IT'S TIME TO BREAK THE RULES.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.993
I WISH EVERY GIRL IN DIMMSDALE
WAS IN LOVE WITH ME,

09:21.060 --> 09:22.662
THAT I HAD STRAIGHT "A"s
IN ALL MY CLASSES,

09:22.728 --> 09:24.730
AND INSTEAD OF A MONEY TREE,
I HAD A WHOLE MONEY FARM.

09:27.733 --> 09:28.668
[girls screaming]

09:28.734 --> 09:32.038
all: WE LOVE YOU, TIMMY!

09:34.473 --> 09:38.644
- YAY, MY MONEY TREE
TURNED INTO A MONEY FARM!

09:38.711 --> 09:39.645
- OH, NO.

09:39.712 --> 09:40.780
THE CROPS ARE COMING IN.

09:40.846 --> 09:41.781
I BETTER HARVEST THEM

09:41.847 --> 09:42.982
BEFORE THOSE RACCOONS GET BACK

09:43.049 --> 09:44.383
FROM THEIR EUROPEAN CRUISE!

09:44.450 --> 09:46.552
- RULE BREAK. RULE BREAK.
RULE BREAK.

09:46.619 --> 09:47.987
- IT WORKED!

09:48.054 --> 09:50.456
- I KNEW WE COULD TRUST WANDA
TO DISTRACT JUANDISSIMO.

09:50.523 --> 09:51.791
I BET SHE'S GOT HIM
WRAPPED AROUND

09:51.857 --> 09:53.559
HER FROSTBITTEN LITTLE FINGER.

09:53.626 --> 09:54.961
- KISS ME, WANDA.

09:55.027 --> 09:57.296
STOP GIVING ME
THE COLD SHOULDER.

09:57.363 --> 09:58.631
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

09:58.698 --> 10:00.633
WHY IS THERE SO MUCH COLD
ON YOUR SHOULDER?

10:00.700 --> 10:03.002
[dramatic music]

10:03.069 --> 10:04.870
- WHAT TOOK YOU CLOWNS SO LONG?

10:04.937 --> 10:06.105
I MEAN--

10:06.172 --> 10:08.107
WHAT IS THE FAIRY COUNCIL
DOING HERE?

10:08.174 --> 10:10.076
- JUANDISSIMO?
-<i> QUE?</i>

10:10.142 --> 10:11.744
- YOU LET TIMMY TURNER
GET AWAY WITH WISHES

10:11.811 --> 10:13.245
THAT VIOLATES THE RULES.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.581
YOU'RE FIRED!

10:15.648 --> 10:17.249
- WANDA, MY LOVE.

10:17.316 --> 10:21.854
I MAY NOT HAVE MY JOB,
BUT AT LEAST WE HAVE EACH OTHER.

10:21.921 --> 10:23.589
- CARNE ASADA!

10:23.656 --> 10:25.658
YES, I'M PRETTY SURE

10:25.725 --> 10:28.294
THERE'S A CAST IRON SKILLET
IN THERE.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.032
[dramatic music]

10:33.099 --> 10:34.433
- JORGEN VON STRANGLE,

10:34.500 --> 10:38.804
YOU HAVE BEEN REINSTATED
AS KEEPER OF THE RULES.

10:38.871 --> 10:40.373
[trumpeting fanfare]

10:40.439 --> 10:41.974
- YAY!

10:42.041 --> 10:43.642
I FEEL WHOLE AGAIN, TURNER.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.344
THANK YOU FOR GETTING ME
MY JOB BACK,

10:45.411 --> 10:46.479
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS YOU

10:46.545 --> 10:48.114
WHO GOT ME FIRED
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.482
WHICH REMINDS ME,

10:49.548 --> 10:51.283
I HAVE TO GET RID
OF ALL YOUR ILLEGAL WISHES.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.284
[girls screaming]

10:54.754 --> 10:56.322
- I'M OKAY WITH THE "F"s,

10:56.389 --> 10:58.190
BUT COULDN'T YOU HAVE LEFT
THE GIRLS?

10:58.257 --> 11:00.393
[ice cream truck jingling
<i>All Around the Mulberry Bush]</i>

11:00.459 --> 11:02.061
- OH, ICE CREAM!

11:02.128 --> 11:04.063
AND I FINALLY HAVE
ENOUGH CHANGE.

11:07.299 --> 11:09.802
NO!

11:09.869 --> 11:11.537
- WANDA, MY LOVE.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.672
I LOST MY JOB
AND MY CORPORATE HOUSING.

11:13.739 --> 11:15.274
CAN I STAY WITH YOU,
<i>POR FAVOR?</i>

11:15.341 --> 11:16.575
- OF COURSE YOU CAN.

11:16.642 --> 11:18.744
COME ON,
I'LL SHOW YOU TO YOUR ROOM.

11:18.811 --> 11:21.080
HERE IT IS.

11:21.147 --> 11:22.081
[whistling]

11:22.148 --> 11:25.284
- IT'S COLD IN HERE.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.652
I SHOULDN'T HAVE FLEXED.

11:26.719 --> 11:29.755
I REALLY NEEDED THAT SHIRT.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.323
<i>AY, MUY FRIO.</i>

11:32.591 --> 11:34.126
- OOH, A HOT DOG.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.695
[jittery yelling]

11:51.710 --> 11:52.645
- THIS IS SO EXCITING!

11:52.711 --> 11:55.347
[crowd chatting excitedly]

11:55.414 --> 11:58.284
- THIS IS CHET UBETCHA
REPORTING FROM DIMMSDALE DAYS,

11:58.350 --> 12:00.186
THE ANNUAL FESTIVAL
WHERE LOCAL RESIDENTS

12:00.252 --> 12:02.922
TRY TO TURN A PROFIT
FROM THEIR PATHETIC HOBBIES.

12:02.988 --> 12:04.323
IN UNRELATED NEWS,

12:04.390 --> 12:06.025
WHO WANTS TO BUY
SOME SEASHELL EARMUFFS

12:06.092 --> 12:08.394
MADE BY A FAMOUS REPORTER?

12:08.461 --> 12:09.728
I CAN HEAR THE OCEAN!

12:09.795 --> 12:10.963
OH, NO. WAIT.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.431
THAT'S A HERMIT CRAB
WITH ASTHMA.

12:12.498 --> 12:15.601
[hermit crab
breathing raspingly]

12:15.668 --> 12:18.571
- I WONDER HOW MY MOM'S DOING
WITH HER BANANA BREAD BOOTH.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.339
- I CAN'T HEAR YOU, TIMMY.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.007
THERE'S A SHRIMP IN MY EAR.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.375
IT'S NOT FROM THE EARMUFFS.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.244
IT'S FROM
THE CAJUN FOOD STAND.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.079
THANK GOODNESS
THERE'S COCKTAIL SAUCE

12:27.146 --> 12:28.447
IN MY BELLY BUTTON.

12:28.514 --> 12:30.116
[munching happily]

12:30.182 --> 12:32.485
- SPORT,
I THINK SOMETHING'S WRONG

12:32.551 --> 12:34.253
WITH YOUR MOM'S BANANA BREAD.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.955
[all belching]

12:36.021 --> 12:37.256
- WHOA, MOM.

12:37.323 --> 12:39.592
WHY ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS
BURPING UP BUBBLES?

12:39.658 --> 12:42.128
- WELL--
AND THIS IS JUST A THEORY--

12:42.194 --> 12:45.064
PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE INSTEAD
OF USING BANANAS IN THE RECIPE,

12:45.131 --> 12:47.099
I USED BANANA SHAMPOO.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.801
- SHAMPOO IS POISON!

12:48.868 --> 12:50.836
IT CAN HAVE
TERRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS!

12:50.903 --> 12:53.172
- BUT I USE SHAMPOO
IN EVERYTHING

12:53.239 --> 12:55.307
EXCEPT MY HOMEMADE SHAMPOO.

12:55.374 --> 12:56.909
I USE BANANAS IN THAT.

12:56.976 --> 12:58.110
- SPARK TARTS!

12:58.177 --> 12:59.745
GET YOUR SPARK TARTS!

12:59.812 --> 13:00.746
- OH, DEAR.

13:00.813 --> 13:01.981
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT SHAMPOO

13:02.047 --> 13:03.082
HAVING SIDE EFFECTS.

13:03.149 --> 13:05.017
I'M HEARING THE DOG TALK.

13:05.084 --> 13:07.153
- SPARKY,
THESE ARE DOG TREATS.

13:07.219 --> 13:10.122
YOU CAN'T SELL THEM
TO HUMANS.

13:10.189 --> 13:11.357
[munching]

13:11.423 --> 13:13.025
MMM, OH, YES, YOU CAN!

13:13.092 --> 13:14.693
THESE ARE DELICIOUS!

13:14.760 --> 13:17.496
HEY, EVERYONE,
COME GET YOUR SPARK TARTS!

13:17.563 --> 13:20.332
[crowd talking]

13:20.399 --> 13:21.600

13:21.667 --> 13:23.269
- THESE ARE FANTASTIC.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.037
I LOVE SPARK TARTS!

13:25.104 --> 13:27.540

AND LET ME CAPTURE YOUR MAGIC--

13:27.606 --> 13:29.708
I MEAN, YOUR LIKENESS
IN A FUN PHOTO!

13:34.513 --> 13:35.781
[sign buzzes]

13:35.848 --> 13:37.616
YOU'RE NOT A FAIRY.
GET OUT!

13:37.683 --> 13:39.185
- WHERE'S MY PHOTO?

13:39.251 --> 13:40.519
- I SAID GET OUT!

13:40.586 --> 13:41.520
- [screams]

13:41.587 --> 13:42.521
HEY, MR. CRACKERS.

13:42.588 --> 13:43.522
CAN I GET A PICTURE OF ME

13:43.589 --> 13:44.857
AND MY NEW BEST FRIEND,

13:44.924 --> 13:46.692
THIS PLATE OF
DELICIOUS SPARK TARTS?

13:46.759 --> 13:48.327
- OH, SURE,
DO YOU WANT WALLET SIZE OR--

13:48.394 --> 13:51.730
GET OUT!

13:51.797 --> 13:53.465
[sign dings]
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.701
THERE'S FAIRY MAGIC
IN THIS SPARK TART.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.503
I'VE GOT TO TAKE IT BACK
TO THE CROCKER CAVE

13:57.570 --> 13:58.904
FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS

13:58.971 --> 14:00.973
AND EVENTUALLY
TO DUNK IT IN MILK.

14:01.040 --> 14:05.477
[laughing crazily]

14:05.544 --> 14:07.780
NOW TO SEE IF THERE'S
ENOUGH FAIRY MAGIC IN THIS TREAT

14:07.846 --> 14:08.814
TO MAKE A WISH.

14:08.881 --> 14:10.082
WHAT WILL I WISH FOR?

14:10.149 --> 14:12.451
A SPACE LASER TO ANNIHILATE
ALL MY ENEMIES?

14:12.518 --> 14:15.487
NO, I NEED TO WISH FOR SOMETHING
REALLY USEFUL,

14:15.554 --> 14:16.655
LIKE DENTAL FLOSS

14:16.722 --> 14:19.191
THAT WON'T SNAP
BETWEEN MY TEETH.

14:19.258 --> 14:21.260
IRONICALLY, THE ONLY WAY
TO GET THE FLOSS OUT

14:21.327 --> 14:22.561
IS WITH MORE FLOSS.

14:22.628 --> 14:23.996
IT'S A VICIOUS CIRCLE!

14:24.063 --> 14:24.997
[electronics beeping]

14:25.064 --> 14:26.832
- ANALYSIS COMPLETE.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.701
ITEM CONTAINS ONLY
ONE MILLIONTH

14:28.767 --> 14:31.036
OF THE MAGIC REQUIRED
TO MAKE A WISH.

14:31.103 --> 14:32.137
- DARN IT!

14:32.204 --> 14:33.339
THAT MEAN IN ORDER
TO MAKE A WISH,

14:33.405 --> 14:35.040
I'M GONNA NEED HOW MANY TREATS?

14:35.107 --> 14:36.041
LET'S SEE.

14:36.108 --> 14:38.010
CARRY THE FIVE,
DIVIDE BY FOUR.

14:38.077 --> 14:40.512
- YOU NEED A MILLION, YOU MORON.

14:40.579 --> 14:42.848
- I WANTED TO ADD IT UP MYSELF,
COMPUTER!

14:42.915 --> 14:44.016
NOW, I JUST HAVE TO GET

14:44.083 --> 14:45.884
A MILLION SPARK TARTS
FROM TURNER.

14:45.951 --> 14:47.586
BUT I CAN'T APPROACH HIM AS ME,

14:47.653 --> 14:48.954
SO I'LL NEED A--
BUH--

14:49.021 --> 14:49.955
LET ME THINK--

14:50.022 --> 14:51.257
- DISGUISE.

14:51.323 --> 14:52.625
- I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THAT ONE.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.627
I WAS GOING THROUGH
THE "D" WORDS IN MY HEAD!

14:54.693 --> 14:56.028
[cackles]

14:56.095 --> 14:57.696
[dramatic music]

14:57.763 --> 14:58.697
LET'S SEE.

14:58.764 --> 14:59.698
THE GRIM REAPER?

14:59.765 --> 15:00.833
NO, I'LL WEAR THAT TONIGHT

15:00.899 --> 15:02.635
AND SCARE MOTHER
DURING BATH TIME.

15:02.701 --> 15:04.603
LET'S SEE WHAT OTHER COSTUMES
I HAVE.

15:04.670 --> 15:05.938
HOLD THE PHONE!

15:06.005 --> 15:08.040
STEREOTYPICAL 1920s
RICH GUY!

15:08.107 --> 15:09.375
THAT'S PERFECT!

15:09.441 --> 15:12.478
OKAY, LET'S GET THIS SHOW
ON THE, UM...

15:12.544 --> 15:13.479
- ROAD.

15:13.545 --> 15:14.747
- I WAS GETTING TO THAT!

15:14.813 --> 15:17.750
I WAS JUST ON
THE "R" WORDS!

15:17.816 --> 15:19.184
- WOW, SPARKY.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.687
WE REALLY CLEANED UP
SELLING YOUR SPARK TARTS.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.623
- OH, TIMMY!

15:24.690 --> 15:25.924
CAN I BORROW SOME MONEY?

15:25.991 --> 15:27.259
I NEED TO BUY
MORE SPARK TARTS.

15:27.326 --> 15:28.427
THEY'RE FANTASTIC.

15:28.494 --> 15:29.428
- SORRY, DAD.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.763
WE'RE ALL OUT.

15:30.829 --> 15:32.498
- THEN GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY,
YOU SWINDLER.

15:32.564 --> 15:33.599
- YOU KNOW, SPARKY,

15:33.666 --> 15:35.034
IF WE WENT INTO BUSINESS
TOGETHER,

15:35.100 --> 15:37.136
WE COULD REALLY MAKE A FORTUNE
WITH THOSE SPARK TARTS,

15:37.202 --> 15:39.805
OR AT LEAST MAKE THE MONEY BACK
THAT MY DAD JUST TOOK FROM US.

15:39.872 --> 15:40.806
- I'M IN.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.474
BUT DIMMSDALE DAYS IS OVER.

15:42.541 --> 15:43.676
WHO'RE WE GONNA SELL THEM TO?

15:43.742 --> 15:44.677
- HELLO.

15:44.743 --> 15:45.678
I'M A BILLIONAIRE

15:45.744 --> 15:47.012
FROM THE 1920s

15:47.079 --> 15:48.681
WHO WOULD LIKE TO BUY
A MILLION SPARK TARTS.

15:48.747 --> 15:50.249
I CLIMBED THIS LADDER

15:50.316 --> 15:52.651
'CAUSE RICH PEOPLE ALWAYS
CLIMB THE LADDER TO THE TOP.

15:52.718 --> 15:54.586
- I'M SORRY.
WHO ARE YOU?

15:54.653 --> 15:56.121
- THE NAME'S PHIL THERICH.

15:56.188 --> 15:57.423
HERE'S MY CARD.

15:57.489 --> 16:00.859
- "PHIL THERICH,
1920s BILLIONAIRE."

16:00.926 --> 16:01.927
WOW.

16:01.994 --> 16:03.962
A MILLION SPARK TARTS?
OKAY.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.865
THEY'RE $1 EACH,
SO IT'LL COST YOU $1 MILLION,

16:06.932 --> 16:07.900
MR. THERICH.

16:07.966 --> 16:09.034
- OH--
OH, YEAH!

16:09.101 --> 16:10.369
RIGHT!
OKAY.

16:10.436 --> 16:13.405
I'LL BE BACK FOR THE SPARK TARTS
IN 24 HOURS.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.506
[screams]

16:14.573 --> 16:15.607
[grunts]

16:15.674 --> 16:16.642
- WHOO-HOO!

16:16.709 --> 16:18.077
SPARKY, WE'RE GONNA BE RICH.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.878
POOF UP YOUR SPARK TARTS.

16:19.945 --> 16:21.280
- I CAN'T POOF THEM UP.

16:21.347 --> 16:22.815
IT'S A SPECIAL RECIPE.

16:22.881 --> 16:24.483
WE HAVE TO BAKE THEM
OURSELVES.

16:24.550 --> 16:25.484
- WHAT?

16:25.551 --> 16:27.219
WE HAVE TO WORK FOR $1 MILLION?

16:27.286 --> 16:28.654
THAT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

16:28.721 --> 16:29.655
- DON'T WORRY, TIMMY.

16:29.722 --> 16:30.656
WE'LL HELP.

16:30.723 --> 16:31.924
WITH THE RIGHT ATTITUDE,

16:31.990 --> 16:33.959
WE'LL BE DONE IN NO TIME.

16:34.026 --> 16:37.363
- WE'RE NOT DONE!

16:37.429 --> 16:42.167
- WOW, DO I HATE BAKING
THESE STUPID SPARK TARTS.

16:42.234 --> 16:43.936
- WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR HOURS

16:44.002 --> 16:46.105
AND WE'RE NOWHERE CLOSE
TO MAKING A MILLION.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.873
COSMO, HOW MANY HAVE WE DONE?

16:47.940 --> 16:49.341
- 37.

16:49.408 --> 16:50.743
- HUNDRED OR THOUSAND?

16:50.809 --> 16:52.611
- JUST 37.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.713
[munching]

16:54.780 --> 16:56.014
MAKE THAT 36.

16:56.081 --> 16:57.015
I JUST ATE ONE.

16:57.082 --> 16:58.250
OOH, THESE ARE GOOD.

16:58.317 --> 16:59.952
[munching]

17:00.018 --> 17:02.154
OKAY, NOW WE HAVE 19.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.455
DON'T WORRY, TIMMY.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.557
I GOT A BUNCH
OF MAGICAL ELVES TO HELP US.

17:05.624 --> 17:06.558
- WE'RE NOT ELVES.

17:06.625 --> 17:07.559
WE'RE JOCKEYS.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.428
- I'M A BAKER, NOT A SHRINK.

17:09.494 --> 17:11.096
DON'T TELL ME YOUR PROBLEMS.

17:11.163 --> 17:13.332
NOW PUT ON A HAIRNET
AND START BAKING.

17:21.973 --> 17:22.907
[sign dings]

17:22.974 --> 17:23.909
- WE DID IT, EVERYONE.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.244
A MILLION SPARK TARTS!

17:26.310 --> 17:28.414
[all cheer]

17:28.480 --> 17:30.182
- WAIT, WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

17:30.249 --> 17:32.251
- I ATE THEM,
AND THEY WERE DELICIOUS!

17:32.317 --> 17:34.553
- YOU ATE A MILLION?

17:34.620 --> 17:36.288
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, TIMMY.

17:36.355 --> 17:37.990
COUNTING THE ONES I ATE
AT THE FAIR,

17:38.056 --> 17:40.726
I'M ONLY UP TO
999,999.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.095
I THREW THE REST
AT DINKLEBERG'S STUPID FACE.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.763
- GREAT.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

17:44.830 --> 17:47.466
WE'VE ONLY GOT 12 HOURS TO MAKE
A MILLION MORE SPARK TARTS

17:47.533 --> 17:48.901
AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HELP.

17:48.967 --> 17:50.169
- NO PROBLEM, TIMMY.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.403
I GOT MORE ELVES.

17:51.470 --> 17:52.404
- WE'RE NOT ELVES.

17:52.471 --> 17:53.439
WE'RE FIRST-GRADERS.

17:53.505 --> 17:54.773
- I WOULD BELIEVE THAT

17:54.840 --> 17:57.276
IF I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW DECEPTIVE ELVES CAN BE.

18:02.848 --> 18:05.651
[all snoring]

18:05.717 --> 18:07.019
- WE DID IT!

18:07.085 --> 18:09.922
WE MADE ANOTHER MILLION
SPARK TARTS JUST IN TIME.

18:09.988 --> 18:11.323
WE'RE GONNA BE RICH!

18:11.390 --> 18:12.491
- SPEAKING OF RICH,

18:12.558 --> 18:14.092
IT IS I, PHIL THERICH.

18:14.159 --> 18:16.128
I TAKE IT
MY SPARK TARTS ARE READY.

18:16.195 --> 18:17.830
THEY'RE ALL YOURS,
MR. THERICH.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.465
JUST PAY US $1 MILLION.

18:19.531 --> 18:21.733
- HERE YOU GO,
$1 MILLION BILL.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.469
AND IT'S A RED ONE.

18:23.535 --> 18:24.703
- WAIT A MINUTE.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.239
THIS BILL HAS MR. CROCKER'S FACE
ON IT.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.574
- THAT'S RIGHT, TURNER!

18:28.640 --> 18:30.642
IT'S ME, CLEVERLY DISGUISED

18:30.709 --> 18:32.945
BEHIND THIS MONOCLE
THE WHOLE TIME!

18:33.011 --> 18:35.147
AND NOW THAT I HAVE
A MILLION SPARK TARTS,

18:35.214 --> 18:37.483
I CAN MAKE A WISH
TO ANNIHILATE YOU!

18:37.549 --> 18:38.484
[screams]

18:38.550 --> 18:39.485
[grunts]

18:39.551 --> 18:40.586
SWALLOWED MY MONOCLE!

18:40.652 --> 18:44.590
[laughing crazily]

18:44.656 --> 18:45.924
- I DON'T GET IT.

18:45.991 --> 18:47.559
WHY DOES MR. CROCKER THINK
HE CAN MAKE A WISH

18:47.626 --> 18:49.127
WITH A MILLION SPARK TARTS?

18:49.194 --> 18:51.530
- WELL--
AND THIS IS JUST A THEORY--

18:51.597 --> 18:53.198
IT COULD BE BECAUSE
THE SECRET INGREDIENT

18:53.265 --> 18:55.767
IN SPARK TARTS
IS A PINCH OF FAIRY DUST.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.002
- WHAT?

18:57.069 --> 18:58.837
THEN MR. CROCKER
REALLY CAN ANNIHILATE ME.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.607
COSMO, WANDA,
YOU GOT TO HELP ME!

19:01.673 --> 19:03.642
- OH, NO,
THEY'RE STILL KNOCKED OUT

19:03.709 --> 19:04.943
FROM BAKING ALL NIGHT.

19:05.010 --> 19:08.847
[both snoring]

19:08.914 --> 19:12.484
- COVER YOUR NOSE
WHEN YOU SNEEZE, COSMO.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.620
- COME ON IN,
SUPERMODEL TATIANA.

19:14.686 --> 19:15.921
THE WATER'S GREAT!

19:15.988 --> 19:18.123
- LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
ON OUR OWN, SPARKY.

19:18.190 --> 19:22.561
- [snoring]

19:22.628 --> 19:23.962
- COVER YOUR NOSE
WHEN YOU SNEEZE,

19:24.029 --> 19:25.497
SUPERMODEL TATIANA.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.266
- HOW AM I GONNA STOP
MR. CROCKER?

19:27.332 --> 19:29.268
I'M ON MY OWN
WITH NO MAGIC.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.303
- OH, TIMMY?

19:31.370 --> 19:33.372
OH, I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

19:33.438 --> 19:34.640
- THAT'S IT.

19:34.706 --> 19:38.544
MY DAD ATE
999,999 SPARK TARTS.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.479
IF I CAN GET HIM TO EAT
ONE MORE,

19:40.546 --> 19:43.849
HE'LL HAVE THE MAGIC I NEED
TO STOP MR. CROCKER.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.484
- [groaning]

19:45.551 --> 19:46.485
OH, TIMMY.

19:46.552 --> 19:47.553
I SHOULDN'T HAVE EATEN

19:47.619 --> 19:49.388
SO MANY DELICIOUS SPARK TARTS.

19:49.454 --> 19:50.556
- NO, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

19:50.622 --> 19:53.258
NOW EAT ONE MORE!

19:53.325 --> 19:56.361
- WHOA, I FEEL
LIGHT AS A FEATHER.

19:58.196 --> 20:00.666
- COME ON, WE GOT TO
GET TO MR. CROCKER'S HOUSE.

20:00.732 --> 20:02.601
NO TIME TO WASTE.

20:04.670 --> 20:05.604
[electricity crackling]

20:05.671 --> 20:07.005
- OW, HIT A POWER LINE!

20:07.072 --> 20:08.240
- WALK IT OFF.

20:14.613 --> 20:18.116
- 999,998,

20:18.183 --> 20:21.553
999,999,

20:21.620 --> 20:23.555
1 MILLION!

20:23.622 --> 20:27.125
- YOU'VE GOT MAGIC.

20:27.192 --> 20:28.427
- EXCELLENT!

20:28.493 --> 20:30.729
NOW I CAN MAKE A WISH
TO ANNIHILATE TURNER

20:30.796 --> 20:33.498
OR I COULD GET RID
OF THAT ACCURSED DENTAL FLOSS.

20:33.565 --> 20:37.269
I TRIED USING TOOTHPICKS,
BUT THOSE GOT STUCK TOO.

20:37.336 --> 20:39.137
OR I COULD WISH FOR CORN.

20:39.204 --> 20:40.138
NO, WAIT.

20:40.205 --> 20:41.139
THAT'S WHAT KICKED OFF

20:41.206 --> 20:42.140
THIS FLOSSING NIGHTMARE

20:42.207 --> 20:43.408
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

20:43.475 --> 20:44.943
[trumpeting fanfare]

20:45.010 --> 20:46.945
- [grunts, yells]

20:47.012 --> 20:48.880
- SUCK IT UP.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.282
- YOU'RE TOO LATE, TURNER

20:50.349 --> 20:51.883
AND THAT STRANGE,
LIFELESS BALLOON

20:51.950 --> 20:53.051
THAT LOOKS LIKE YOUR DAD.

20:53.118 --> 20:54.953
I PUT THE MAGIC
FROM THOSE SPARK TARTS

20:55.020 --> 20:57.289
INTO A WAND!

20:57.356 --> 20:58.590
- [yells]

20:58.657 --> 21:00.325
- WELL, I PUT THE MAGIC
FROM THOSE SPARK TARTS

21:00.392 --> 21:02.661
INTO A WAND OF MY OWN.

21:02.728 --> 21:05.297
- YOU THINK YOU HAVE
THE UPPER HAND, TURNER,

21:05.364 --> 21:07.432
BUT I'M GONNA
TURN THE TABLES ON YOU.

21:07.499 --> 21:08.634
[grunting]

21:08.700 --> 21:10.569
OH, THOSE ARE HEAVY TABLES.

21:10.636 --> 21:13.138
HMM, LOOKS LIKE I ACTUALLY
TIPPED THE TABLES INSTEAD.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.139
NO MATTER!

21:14.206 --> 21:15.240
NOW YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE

21:15.307 --> 21:16.742
THE LONG WAY AROUND.

21:16.808 --> 21:17.776
- THAT'S IT?

21:17.843 --> 21:18.977
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?

21:19.044 --> 21:22.080
- NO, I ALSO HAVE
A ROBOT SPIDER.

21:22.147 --> 21:23.682
[robot spider roars]

21:23.749 --> 21:26.218
- WOW, TIMMY, YOU HAVE
A REALLY WEIRD RELATIONSHIP

21:26.284 --> 21:29.021
WITH YOUR MATH TEACHER.

21:29.087 --> 21:32.024
- [yells]

21:32.090 --> 21:33.125
- GET HIM!

21:33.191 --> 21:34.459
- I CAN'T.

21:34.526 --> 21:36.862
I'M BLOCKED BY
THESE TIPPED TABLES.

21:36.928 --> 21:38.964
[whimpering]

21:39.031 --> 21:41.066
- OH, WELL, I'LL JUST
HAVE TO USE MY MAGIC WAND

21:41.133 --> 21:42.601
TO ANNIHILATE YOU!

21:42.668 --> 21:43.669
- [yells]

21:43.735 --> 21:45.871
I WISH YOU HAD
NO MORE MAGIC.

21:45.937 --> 21:47.139
- [yelps]

21:47.205 --> 21:49.841
- I ATE A MILLION SPARK TARTS,
TIMMY.

21:49.908 --> 21:51.543
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T BE
SHAKING ME.

21:51.610 --> 21:52.544
[yells]

21:52.611 --> 21:53.545
[flatulence]

21:53.612 --> 21:54.546
[grunts]

21:54.613 --> 21:55.681
- CURSE YOU, TURNER

21:55.747 --> 21:57.683
AND YOUR WEIRD DEFLATING
DAD BALLOON.

21:57.749 --> 22:00.285
I PROMISE I'LL FIND
ANOTHER WAY TO DESTROY YOU.

22:00.352 --> 22:01.720
BUT FIRST I NEED TO
TIP THESE TABLES

22:01.787 --> 22:04.456
BACK TO THEIR UPRIGHT POSITION.

22:04.523 --> 22:06.792
- WELL, GUYS,
EVERYTHING'S BACK TO NORMAL,

22:06.858 --> 22:09.761
AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
ANY MORE MAGIC SPARK TARTS.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.063
- HI, TIMMY!

22:11.129 --> 22:12.197
- OH, NO!

22:12.264 --> 22:14.599
MOM, DID YOU EAT
A BUNCH OF SPARK TARTS?

22:14.666 --> 22:15.600
- NO, HONEY.

22:15.667 --> 22:16.601
MY PURSE GOT CAUGHT

22:16.668 --> 22:18.437
ON A HOT AIR BALLOON.

22:18.503 --> 22:19.838
[electricity crackling]
[yells]

22:19.905 --> 22:21.339
I HIT A POWER LINE!

22:21.406 --> 22:23.375
- WALK IT OFF, MOM.

22:23.442 --> 22:25.444
- IT'S BATH TIME, MOTHER.
