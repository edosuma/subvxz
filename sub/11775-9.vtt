00:05.806 --> 00:08.008
,
( theme music playing )

00:12.280 --> 00:14.382
Larry:
IS ANYBODY WORRIED ABOUT
DIRT ON THEIR FOOD HERE?

00:14.482 --> 00:17.985
YOU KNOW, THESE BUSES COME BY.
EVERYBODY MAKES SUCH A BIG DEAL
ABOUT EATING OUTSIDE.

00:18.086 --> 00:20.621
- I FIND IT DISGUSTING.
- IT'S AL FRESCO.

00:20.721 --> 00:23.591
HEY, DO ME A FAVOR AND REMIND
ME TO PICK UP MY GLOVE LATER.
I'M GETTING IT RESTITCHED.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.426
- OKAY.
- YOU'RE WEARING GLOVES?
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.161
- NO, MY BASEBALL GLOVE.
- Susan: OH, BASEBALL.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.929
THEY'RE IN A LEAGUE.
IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL IT?

00:29.029 --> 00:31.299
WE'RE PLAYING
FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP.
ARE YOU NOT LISTENING?

00:31.399 --> 00:33.467
Larry:
I HOPE IT TURNS OUT BETTER
THAN THE GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.303
- Susie: THAT'S TRUE.
- HEY, DO YOU WANT TO COME?

00:35.403 --> 00:36.904
NO, I DON'T LIKE BASEBALL.

00:37.004 --> 00:38.606
- I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED.
- WHY?

00:38.706 --> 00:40.141
YOU I CAN UNDERSTAND.
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED
A LONG TIME.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.310
YOU COULD CARE LESS
ABOUT WHAT HE DOES.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.645
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.
- BUT WE'VE JUST STARTED DATING.

00:44.745 --> 00:47.615
AND WHEN YOU FIRST START
DATING YOU ALWAYS DO THINGS
THAT ARE DISTASTEFUL.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.951
- THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS.
- FISH AND CHICKEN.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.053
WE'RE SPLITTING THAT SO IT
REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.123
OKAY, HOW ABOUT I GIVE
THAT TO YOU?

00:55.223 --> 00:58.392
AND CHICKEN.
ENJOY.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.894
- THAT LOOKS GOOD, JEFF.
- HOW DO YOU WANT TO WORK THIS?

01:00.994 --> 01:04.064
- I'M GONNA KEEP THE CHICKEN.
- YOU CAN'T KEEP THE CHICKEN.
WE SAID WE'RE GONNA SPLIT IT.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.267
THAT FISH, TO BE HONEST,
DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.369
I ONLY CHOSE IT BECAUSE I KNEW
WE WERE GONNA SPLIT IT.

01:08.469 --> 01:11.872
LOOK, YOU BROUGHT
THE FISH INTO IT.
I'M SAYING NO.

01:11.972 --> 01:15.476
- THAT'S COMPLETELY UNETHICAL.
- HONESTLY, LARRY, THIS IS WHY
HE'S A GOOD MANAGER.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.112
YOU SHOULD BE
THANKFUL HE'S UNETHICAL.
HE'S UNSCRUPULOUS.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.114
- YOU WANT SOME OF MY SALAD?
- OH MY GOD.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.583
- THIS IS AMAZING.
- IT LOOKS REALLY REALLY GOOD.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.918
I'M NOT EVEN JOKING.
IT'S FANTASTIC.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.287
- REALLY?
- THE FOOD HERE IS GREAT.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.788
- CAN I TRY IT?
- NOPE.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.558
- JUST A LITTLE TASTE?
- NOPE, YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.493
- YOU'RE SO LYING.
- NO, I SWEAR TO GOD.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.163
Larry:
I LEARNED A VERY VALUABLE
LESSON TODAY.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.930
- WHAT DID YOU LEARN?
- I'D RATHER KEEP IT TO MYSELF.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.200
KNOW SOMETHING?
I'VE LEARNED A VALUABLE
LESSON TODAY TOO.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.102
NO, YOU'RE ONLY SAYING
YOU LEARNED A LESSON BECAUSE
I SAID I LEARNED A LESSON.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.537
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.
I'M JUST SHARING.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.773
I KNOW FOR A FACT
YOU DID NOT LEARN A LESSON.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.342
- IT'S A COINCIDENCE.
- SPEAKING OF LESSONS,
I'M SO SORRY--

01:48.442 --> 01:51.145
I HAVE TO GO.
I HAVE A PIANO LESSON.

01:51.245 --> 01:54.915
GOOD LUCK AT
YOUR WIFFLE BALL GAME
OR WHATEVER.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.750
- SOFTBALL.
- OKAY, THANKS.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.086
- BYE.
- SEE YOU AFTER THE GAME.
SEE YOU THURSDAY.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.888
- ALL RIGHT,
TAKE A SHOWER.
- CALL ME.

02:00.988 --> 02:02.456
- IS SHE A GREAT GIRL?
- SHE'S GREAT.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.292
SHE LIKES YOU,
WHICH IS A SHOCKING
THING TO ME.

02:04.392 --> 02:07.027
- SHE MIGHT.
- NO, SHE'S GOING OUT
WITH HIM AGAIN.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.496
- CAN I SAY SOMETHING?
- WHAT?

02:08.596 --> 02:10.964
- I'VE GOT TO PEE.
- SHE GETS ME.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.033
WELL, YOU'RE LUCKY
SOMEBODY DOES.

02:13.133 --> 02:17.037
LARRY, FAVOR.
JEFF'S BIRTHDAY IS COMING UP.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.539
THERE'S A SIGNING THING
AT THE REGENCY.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.608
MOOKIE WILSON
IS GONNA BE THERE.

02:20.708 --> 02:23.811
I NEED YOU TO GET
THIS SIGNED AS A GIFT.
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

02:23.911 --> 02:27.748
( chimes playing )

02:27.848 --> 02:31.385
LAR.
LAR.

02:31.485 --> 02:35.055
LARRY!
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE'D YOU GO?

02:35.155 --> 02:37.291
- I'M SORRY, WHAT?
- MOOKIE WILSON.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.560
CAN YOU GET MOOKIE WILSON TO
SIGN THIS FOR JEFF'S BIRTHDAY?

02:39.660 --> 02:41.395
- OH YEAH. OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT?

02:41.495 --> 02:45.266
- YEAH, MOOKIE'S
HIS FAVORITE PLAYER.
- YEAH. '86 METS.

02:47.835 --> 02:51.472
Larry:
I LIKE HER, BUT SHE'S GOT A KID
SO WHAT'S GONNA COME OF IT?

02:51.572 --> 02:53.241
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF THE WHOLE THING?

02:53.341 --> 02:55.743
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
WHENEVER I SEE A WOMAN
WHO'S HAPPY,

02:55.843 --> 02:57.378
SHE'S MARRIED.

02:57.478 --> 03:00.748
AND WHENEVER I SEE A MAN
WHO'S HAPPY, HE'S SINGLE.

03:00.848 --> 03:04.017
- MATHEMATICS OF THAT
IS CONFUSING, ISN'T IT?
- YEAH.

03:04.117 --> 03:07.087
ANYWAY, SO WE WERE
AT THIS RESTAURANT,

03:07.187 --> 03:09.357
ALL OF A SUDDEN I HEARD
THIS SOFTEE MUSIC.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.891
THE MR. SOFTEE TRUCK.

03:10.991 --> 03:13.494
- THE MUSIC FROM
THE MR. SOFTEE TRUCK?
- YES.

03:13.594 --> 03:17.665
WHEN I WAS A KID
I HAD A TRAUMATIC INCIDENT

03:17.765 --> 03:20.901
INVOLVING MR. SOFTEE.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.737
- Boy: LET'S DO ANOTHER HAND.
- Girl: OKAY.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.574
TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

03:26.674 --> 03:29.410
- Boy: HERE WE GO.
- Girl: YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA TAKE TWO.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.615
ALL RIGHT, LARRY,
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

03:34.715 --> 03:36.784
I'VE GOT TWO PAIR.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.320
WOW, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.422
I'VE GOT A FLUSH.

03:41.522 --> 03:45.058
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON,
TAKE IT OFF.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.595
COME ON.

03:50.163 --> 03:54.735
THAT'S PRETTY
PRETTY PRETTY GOOD.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.770
( door opens )

03:56.870 --> 03:58.839
( chimes playing )

04:00.374 --> 04:02.042
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING WITH MY DAUGHTER?

04:02.142 --> 04:04.712
COME HERE.
COME HERE.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.814
Father:
YOU BE QUIET AND YOU
LISTEN TO ME.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.318
- WHAT THE FUCK?
- YOUR VAGINA IS SHOWING.

04:10.418 --> 04:14.054
OH MY GOD.
HE'S GOT MORE PUBES
ON HIS FUCKING HEAD.

04:14.154 --> 04:15.756
YOU FORGOT SOMETHING, KID.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.426
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING, KID?

04:18.526 --> 04:21.862
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON,
YOU FOUR-EYED FUCK.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.498
AND TO THIS DAY

04:24.598 --> 04:27.234
WHENEVER I SEE
THE SOFTEE TRUCK

04:27.335 --> 04:29.603
OR ESPECIALLY HEAR
THE MUSIC, THAT MUSIC

04:29.703 --> 04:31.672
THAT GOES IN
A CONTINUOUS LOOP...

04:31.772 --> 04:34.308
( vocalizes tune )

04:42.350 --> 04:43.684
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT?

04:43.784 --> 04:46.086
IT'S DEEPLY DISTURBING,
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

04:46.186 --> 04:47.621
BUT LET ME JUST MAKE SURE
I UNDERSTAND.

04:47.721 --> 04:50.157
YOU FELT
HUMILIATED AS A RESULT
OF THE STRIP POKER GAME?

04:50.257 --> 04:51.825
YES. DO YOU MIND
IF I PUT MY FEET UP HERE?

04:51.925 --> 04:53.293
- PLEASE.
- YOU SURE?

04:53.394 --> 04:55.128
- NO, IT'S FINE.
- A LOT OF PEOPLE
DON'T LIKE IT.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.431
- I AM ABSOLUTELY OKAY WITH IT.
- ALTHOUGH IT'S JUST A SNEAKER.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.633
WELL, I THINK EVEN IF IT WERE
A DRESS SHOE I WOULD BE FINE.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.702
YOU'RE NOT GONNA RESENT
ME WHEN I LEAVE HERE

05:01.802 --> 05:04.605
FOR PUTTING MY FEET UP
AND PUTTING YOU IN THIS
COMPROMISING POSITION?

05:04.705 --> 05:07.441
I DON'T FEEL FUNNY ABOUT IT.
BUT IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER

05:07.541 --> 05:10.344
I HAVE SOME JAPANESE SLIPPERS
YOU COULD CHANGE INTO OUT THERE.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.145
OH, THAT'S KIND OF YOU
TO OFFER, BUT I'D RATHER NOT.

05:12.245 --> 05:15.115
SO JUST TO MAKE SURE
THAT I UNDERSTAND THINGS
THOROUGHLY,

05:15.215 --> 05:17.618
- YOU FELT HUMILIATED--
- WHAT THE HELL THEN, RIGHT?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.853
- SURE, GO AHEAD.
- OKAY.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.556
- YOU FELT HUMILIATED
AS A RESULT OF THIS--
- I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH IT.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.058
- I'M SORRY.
- ALL RIGHT.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.861
THIS WAS A GIRL THAT YOU
KNEW FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
I PRESUME.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.898
- YES. YES.
- YOU WERE PLAYING
STRIP POKER WITH HER.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.100
AND OF COURSE I LOST
ALMOST EVERY HAND.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.935
SHE TOOK OFF
HER SOCKS AND SHOES.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.838
I FEEL LIKE IF SHE
HAD TAKEN THE TOP OFF

05:37.938 --> 05:40.073
MY WHOLE LIFE
WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.078
KEEP IT GOING.
KEEP IT GOING, GUYS.
COME ON.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.714
- HEY, YARI. YARI.
- KEEP IT GOING.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.016
- WHAT WHAT WHAT?
- WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MY CAR?

05:49.116 --> 05:52.019
EASY JOB.
BE READY TOMORROW
LIKE I SAID, OKAY?

05:52.119 --> 05:53.854
- REALLY?
- YOU WORRY TOO MUCH.

05:53.954 --> 05:57.124
- WORRY ABOUT THE GAME.
- WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT THIS GAME.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.493
- YOU NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT THE GAME.
- WE GOT THIS GAME.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.795
CHAMPIONSHIP GAME.
BRING IT IN, EVERYBODY.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.531
COME ON.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.535
OKAY, WE'RE HERE.

06:07.635 --> 06:12.005
WE MADE IT!
WE MADE IT TO THE BIG GAME.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.074
CENTER STAGE.

06:14.174 --> 06:18.378
EVERY ONE OF YOU ALL,
GIVE YOURSELVES A CLAP
ON THE HAND.

06:18.479 --> 06:22.249
I AM SO PROUD
OF EVERY ONE OF YOU.

06:22.349 --> 06:25.753
YOU KNOW,
BEFORE I CAME OUT TODAY

06:25.853 --> 06:28.589
I THINK ABOUT I'M LIKE
THE STEINBRENNER.

06:28.689 --> 06:32.460
AND I THINK, "WHAT WOULD
STEINBRENNER SAY RIGHT NOW?"

06:32.560 --> 06:34.628
HE WOULD SAY

06:34.728 --> 06:38.231
THAT WHEN YOU PUT
ON THIS UNIFORM

06:38.331 --> 06:40.100
WITH MY NAME ON IT,

06:40.200 --> 06:42.503
THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE
FOR WINNING!

06:42.603 --> 06:44.838
NO SUBSTITUTE!

06:44.938 --> 06:47.074
OR YOU HIT THE DECK.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.176
SO WE'RE GOING
TO GO OUT THERE,

06:49.276 --> 06:52.179
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY
THIS OTHER TEAM,

06:52.279 --> 06:53.981
QUOTE UNQUOTE,
RALEIGH'S CLOTHING

06:54.081 --> 06:58.819
WITH THEIR PUSSY
MUSTARD-YELLOW
SHIT UNIFORMS.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.321
WE AREN'T JUST GOING
TO BEAT THEM,

07:01.421 --> 07:04.525
WE WILL GRAB THEM
AND WE WILL FUCK

07:04.625 --> 07:07.828
THEIR SISTERS
IN THE CUNT!

07:07.928 --> 07:09.563
ARE YOU LISTENING?

07:09.663 --> 07:11.565
BRING IT IN.
COME ON.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.967
- FUCK THESE PEOPLE!
- All: FUCK THESE PEOPLE!

07:14.067 --> 07:16.169
YES!

07:16.269 --> 07:20.040
FUCK THEIR SISTERS IN THE CUNT?
WHO TALKS THAT WAY?

07:20.140 --> 07:22.442
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
TWO OUTS.

07:22.543 --> 07:25.178
THIS IS IT-- CHAMPIONSHIP.
ONE MORE OUT, ALL RIGHT?

07:25.278 --> 07:28.716
GROUND BALL GOES TO FIRST,
SECOND OR THIRD OR HOME.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.017
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, YARI.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.119
( crowd cheering )

07:32.219 --> 07:34.154
( chimes playing )

07:43.764 --> 07:45.866
YES!
YOU GOT IT, LARRY.

07:45.966 --> 07:49.402
- HERE IT COMES.
YOU'VE GOT IT.
- Crowd: OH!

07:49.503 --> 07:51.471
WHAT THE FUCK? WHAT?

07:51.572 --> 07:54.474
AND NOW THEY'RE GOING HOME.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.376
HOW DID THIS-- WHAT?

07:56.476 --> 07:59.279
WHERE ARE YOU?
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:59.379 --> 08:01.014
I GOT DISTRACTED
BY THE SOFTEE TRUCK.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.116
- BY THE WHAT?
- WHAT A DOUCHE.
WHAT A DOUCHE.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.786
- YOU SUCK.
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?
- WHAT A LOSER.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.955
A BABY COULD HAVE KICKED
THAT BALL,

08:08.055 --> 08:09.957
- PICKED IT UP,
THROWN IT THREE PLACE.
- STUPID ASS!

08:10.057 --> 08:12.893
- YOU BUCKNERED ME.
- I'M SORRY.

08:12.993 --> 08:17.197
YOU FUCKING BUCKNERED IT.
WHY IS BUCKNER ON MY TEAM?

08:18.265 --> 08:20.634
SORRY.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.405
HEY.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.641
OH, ABOUT TIME.
GOD DAMN, LARRY.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.376
I HAD A SOFTBALL GAME.
I TOLD YOU THAT.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.645
- HOW WAS THE GAME?
- I MADE AN ERROR IN
THE LAST INNING

08:31.745 --> 08:33.614
WITH TWO OUTS THAT COST
US THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.616
MEANWHILE I'M STANDING
THE FUCK OUT HERE COUNTING
MY MOTHERFUCKING NUTS.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.551
KNOW WHY?
I CAN'T GET IN
THE GODDAMN BUILDING.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.654
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- THIS MOTHERFUCKER
IN THE GLASS TUBE.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.023
THIS DUDE RIGHT HERE.
THE GATEKEEPER WON'T LET ME
IN THE GODDAMN BUILDING.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.392
- THAT'S TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.
- THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE.

08:45.492 --> 08:49.329
LET ME JUST SAY THIS, OKAY?
ON BEHALF OF ALL CAUCASIANS,

08:49.429 --> 08:50.864
- I APOLOGIZE.
- PUT THAT SHIT IN.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.833
I APOLOGIZE
FOR THE CAUCASIAN RACE.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.035
BY THE WAY, I HAVE
A VERY GOOD IDEA FOR YOU.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.104
TO AVOID SITUATIONS
LIKE THIS IN THE FUTURE,

08:57.204 --> 09:01.474
I THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
WEARING GLASSES.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.410
- FUCK OUT OF HERE.
- SWEAR TO GOD.

09:03.510 --> 09:06.880
I HAVE NOTICED
THAT WHITE PEOPLE REVERE
BLACK PEOPLE IN GLASSES,

09:06.980 --> 09:09.516
GO OUT OF THEIR WAY
TO DO STUFF FOR THEM.

09:09.617 --> 09:13.053
IF A BLACK MAN
WITH GLASSES GOES UP FOR
A JOB AGAINST A WHITE MAN,

09:13.153 --> 09:15.555
GLASSES GETS THE JOB.
NO GLASSES, NO JOB.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.490
- WE'LL TRY THIS SHIT, LARRY.
IT'S A WAGER.
- YOU'RE OPEN TO IT?

09:17.591 --> 09:19.492
- I'M OPEN TO THIS SHIT.
- BEAUTIFUL.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.461
- I'LL TRY THIS SHIT AND SEE
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENS.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.197
- WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH JENNIFER, MAN?
- I'M SEEING HER TONIGHT.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.434
OH, HA HA!
SEE, I GET A FUCKING
TINGLE IN MY JOHNSON

09:27.534 --> 09:30.003
WHEN A MOTHERFUCKER TELLS ME
HE'S ABOUT TO GET SOME ASS.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.739
- DO YOUR GODDAMN JOB.
- I'LL TALK TO HIM.

09:31.839 --> 09:34.808
( Jennifer moaning )

09:34.908 --> 09:37.177
- ( chimes playing )
- ( Larry gasps )

09:37.277 --> 09:40.580
- Jennifer: OH.
- Larry: OH MY GOD.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.617
LARRY, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

09:49.022 --> 09:51.358
WELL, COME ON,
MR. SOFTEE.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.465
- HEY, YARI.
- OH.

09:58.565 --> 09:59.933
- HEY.
- HEY.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.135
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- IT'S GREAT.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.973
- GOOD.
SO IS THE CAR READY?
- GOOD. GOOD.

10:06.073 --> 10:09.209
- LET ME CHECK.
- BY THE WAY, GREAT GAME
YESTERDAY.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.845
- YOU PITCHED REALLY WELL.
- IT'S NOT READY.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.347
IT'S NOT READY?
HOW COME IT'S NOT READY?

10:14.447 --> 10:17.084
- YOU SAID
IT WAS GONNA BE READY.
- I SAID IT'S NOT READY.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.820
IS IT ALMOST READY?

10:19.920 --> 10:23.323
UM, I THINK HALF.
HALF READY.

10:23.423 --> 10:26.093
- HALF READY?
- YEAH YEAH YEAH.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.995
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:28.929 --> 10:31.598
I GUESS I MADE AN ERROR.

10:31.699 --> 10:34.267
YEAH.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.937
- YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?
I DROPPED THE BALL.
- OKAY.

10:37.037 --> 10:40.040
- NO BIG DEAL.
MADE AN ERROR.
- YOU DIDN'T FIX MY CAR

10:40.140 --> 10:43.143
BECAUSE I MADE AN ERROR?
WHAT ARE YOU, 12 YEARS OLD?

10:43.243 --> 10:45.378
( shouting )
WHAT ARE YOU,
90 YEARS OLD?

10:45.478 --> 10:48.115
YOU LET THE BALL
GO THROUGH YOUR LEGS.
TOO TOO TOO TOT.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.818
THE WHOLE SEASON IS
A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!

10:50.918 --> 10:53.253
- IT'S A SOFTBALL GAME!
- "IT'S A SOFTBALL GAME"?

10:53.353 --> 10:55.889
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT THE STEINBRENNER.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.991
- I AM THE STEINBRENNER.
- YOU'RE THE STEINBRENNER?

10:58.091 --> 10:59.659
- I AM THE STEINBRENNER!
- REALLY?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.995
STEINBRENNER OWNED A MAJOR
LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAM.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.932
- I OWN THIS TEAM.
- YOU OWN 12 T-SHIRTS.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.200
I PAID FOR THEM.
YARI'S AUTONOMICS.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.503
YOU DISGRACED--
YOU DISGRACED MY BUSINESS.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.172
STEINBRENNER ALWAYS SAY--

11:12.272 --> 11:15.743
- HE SAY WINNING
IS THE ONLY ANSWER.
- IT'S IMPORTANT.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.879
HE SAYS WINNING ALL DAY,
EVERY DAY OR GO AWAY.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.647
- I'D LIKE THE CAR.
- YOU'D LIKE THE CAR?

11:20.748 --> 11:22.816
- YEAH.
- I'D LIKE MY
CHAMPIONSHIP BACK.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.517
- GIVE ME THE KEY.
- YOU ARE FIRED.

11:24.617 --> 11:27.020
JUST LIKE-- THAT'S WHAT
GEORGE WOULD DO.
TAKE YOUR CAR.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.557
- GIVE IT TO ME.
- I FIRE YOU.
YOUR CAR IS FIRED.

11:30.657 --> 11:33.026
TAKE YOUR FUCKING CAR.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.728
HERE IS YOUR KEY.
HERE IS YOUR KEY.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.097
I NEVER WANT TO SEE
YOU OR YOUR KEY

11:37.197 --> 11:39.800
WEARING MY NAME
ON YOUR SHIRT AGAIN.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.202
I WON'T WEAR YOUR NAME ON MY
SHIRT AGAIN, THAT'S A PROMISE.

11:42.302 --> 11:45.505
DON'T DISGRACE ME.
GET OUT OF MY-- YARI'S!
GET OUT!

11:45.605 --> 11:48.075
BUCKNER, FUCK YOU.
GO BUCKNER YOURSELF.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.943
GO! FASTER!

11:51.011 --> 11:53.380
SO I GET THE CAR
BACK FROM YARI,

11:53.480 --> 11:55.816
IT'S WORSE THAN IT WAS BEFORE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID TO IT.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.551
THE FRONT SEAT
IS REALLY RATTLING.
IT'S TERRIBLE.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.720
HOLD UP, HOLD UP.
MY SHOE IS UNTIED.

12:00.821 --> 12:04.357
- I'M GONNA GET THE TICKETS.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- ALL RIGHT.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.062
SORRY, WE'RE SOLD OUT.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.632
- ( sighs )
- WHAT HAPPENED?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.301
THEY'RE SOLD OUT.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.037
- SOLD OUT?
- YEAH.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.474
LET ME GO DOWN HERE
AND GIVE IT A SHOT, MAN.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.410
WOW.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.458
WE'RE GOOD.

12:41.661 --> 12:42.830
- ( laughing )
- Larry: HUH?

12:42.930 --> 12:44.631
- Leon: WOW.
- CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

12:44.731 --> 12:47.167
I'M GONNA GET ME
A WHOLE NEW CLASS
OF BITCHES WITH THESE ON.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.669
WOW, THIS IS AMAZING.
IT WORKED.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.672
- THEY WORKED.
SEE, WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
- YOU'RE FUCKING RIGHT.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.209
THIS IS BETTER THAN ANYTHING
THE CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS
HAVE EVER COME UP WITH.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.711
YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT.
I HAVE OVERCOME, GOD DAMN IT.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.047
I GOT TO GET
MOOKIE'S AUTOGRAPH.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.449
I'M GONNA CHECK OUT
JOE PEPITONE OVER HERE.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.818
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

13:07.487 --> 13:09.923
HEY, DR. THURGOOD.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.959
- LARRY, HOW ARE YOU?
- HEY, HI.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.862
YOU'RE GETTING MOOKIE'S
AUTOGRAPH, HUH?

13:14.962 --> 13:16.830
YEAH WELL,
I'M USUALLY A CUBS FAN.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.199
I'M KIND OF ATTRACTED
TO THE HOPELESS CASES.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.968
HEY, RIGHT?

13:21.068 --> 13:22.769
WELL, LISTEN, I HOPE
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

13:22.870 --> 13:25.238
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WERE A KID
WALKING WITH YOUR MOTHER
THROUGH BOHACK'S,

13:25.338 --> 13:28.909
YOU SAW YOUR TEACHER
AND YOU HAD TO REALIZE
SHE DIDN'T LIVE IN SCHOOL?

13:29.009 --> 13:31.845
YOU UNDERSTAND?
LARRY, I DON'T LIVE
IN SCHOOL EITHER.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.114
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
NICE TO SEE YOU.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.416
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.819
HEY, LISTEN.
SO I'VE GOT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.689
WHAT HAPPENED WAS
I WAS IN A SOFTBALL GAME

13:42.789 --> 13:44.992
AND I HEARD
THE SOFTEE THEME--

13:45.092 --> 13:46.359
AGAIN WITH
THE SOFTEE THEME--

13:46.459 --> 13:48.061
AND A GROUND BALL WENT
THROUGH MY LEGS.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.097
THAT COST US THE CHAMPIONSHIP
IN A SOFTBALL GAME.

13:50.197 --> 13:53.733
ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT YOU
WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS HERE?
I MEAN, WHILE WE'RE HERE?

13:53.833 --> 13:56.169
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
WE'RE JUST ON LINE.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.371
AND THEN THAT NIGHT
I WAS IN BED WITH A WOMAN

13:58.471 --> 14:00.840
AND I HEARD THE SOFTEE MUSIC
AGAIN AND I COULDN'T PERFORM.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.943
- WELL, IT IS VERY TROUBLING.
- YES.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.112
- SHE CALLED ME MR. SOFTEE.
- SHE DID?

14:05.212 --> 14:07.680
- YES.
- MY ADVICE IS DON'T TRY
TOO MUCH AT ONCE.

14:07.780 --> 14:10.317
I HAD A CLIENT ONCE,
HE WAS A ROCK GUITARIST.

14:10.417 --> 14:13.220
HE PLAYED FOR THE BAND,
WHAT WAS THE NAME OF IT?

14:13.320 --> 14:16.189
GRAND FUNK RAILROAD.
I DON'T WANT TO REVEAL
HIS NAME BECAUSE--

14:16.289 --> 14:18.225
I ALREADY TOLD YOU HE PLAYED
FOR GRAND FUNK RAILROAD.

14:18.325 --> 14:19.759
YOU CAN JUST LOOK IT UP.
IT'S MARK FARNER.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.895
THE GREAT THING
ABOUT MARK FARNER WAS

14:21.995 --> 14:24.097
HE DIDN'T MESS AROUND WITH
ALL THE EXTRANEOUS NOTES.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.865
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

14:25.966 --> 14:28.201
- HE ONLY PLAYED
THE IMPORTANT NOTES...
- YEAH.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.137
- YUP.
- ...AND THAT'S WHAT
I WANT YOU TO TRY.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.205
I FIND IT A LITTLE TROUBLING
THAT YOU TOLD ME HIS NAME,

14:32.305 --> 14:34.641
BECAUSE NOW YOU COULD BE
TELLING PEOPLE MY NAME.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.176
IT WAS MERELY AN ACCIDENT.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.578
I DON'T WANT THIS ACCIDENT
TO HAPPEN WITH ME.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.281
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.
AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL
HAPPEN WITH YOUR NAME.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.316
- HAVE YOU TALKED
ABOUT ME TO ANYONE?
- OF COURSE NOT.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.752
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO YOU
OR ANY OTHER PATIENT, LARRY.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.388
- I JUST COULDN'T DO IT.
- OH MY GOD.

14:50.057 --> 14:53.493
EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND.
I THINK THAT'S BILL BUCKNER.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.231
WOW.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.733
- BILL BUCKNER. OH MY GOD.
- YEAH, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

15:00.833 --> 15:04.804
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- THIS IS AMAZING THAT
YOU'RE HERE.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.474
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I HAD AN INCIDENT
AT A SOFTBALL GAME

15:07.574 --> 15:09.142
THAT WAS VERY SIMILAR
TO WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.311
OF COURSE YOURS HAPPENED
IN THE WORLD SERIES

15:11.411 --> 15:13.280
IN FRONT OF MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE, BUT NEVERTHELESS

15:13.380 --> 15:15.282
A BALL WENT THROUGH MY LEGS
AND COST US THE GAME.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.951
IT WAS HUMILIATING
AND PEOPLE WERE INSULTING ME.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.020
- I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SEEING
YOU HERE.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.022
HOW DID YOU DEAL
WITH ALL THAT STUFF?

15:22.122 --> 15:25.225
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE GIVING
YOUR BEST EFFORT, IT'S A TEAM
GAME, THOSE THINGS HAPPEN.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.393
YOU'VE JUST GOT
TO FORGET ABOUT IT.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.295
JEEZ, YOU HAVE
A REALLY GOOD ATTITUDE.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.630
I'D LOVE TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THIS.
DO YOU GOT A MINUTE?

15:30.730 --> 15:35.068
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY I WAS
ABOUT READY TO TAKE A BREAK
FOR LUNCH, YEAH.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.305
- CAN I WALK OUT WITH YOU?
- YEAH, SURE.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.107
OH, OKAY, I'VE JUST GOT
TO GET MOOKIE'S AUTOGRAPH.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.808
- I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.
- OH GREAT, THANKS.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.410
THAT GUY OWES ME ONE.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.945
SO I SAW THIS COMMERCIAL
LAST NIGHT.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.481
MICHAEL JORDAN HAD
A HITLER MUSTACHE.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.251
YEAH, I SAW THAT.
HE'S THE FIRST ONE TO WEAR
THAT SINCE HITLER, ISN'T HE?

15:51.351 --> 15:53.320
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK THAT'S TRUE.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.589
- HEY, BUCKNER, YOU SUCK.
- HEY, HAVE A NICE DAY, FELLAS.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.958
NICE CATCH.
( laughs )

15:59.059 --> 16:00.460
WHAT JERKS, HUH?

16:00.560 --> 16:04.064
OH MY GOD. HOW DO YOU
PUT UP WITH THAT?

16:04.164 --> 16:05.865
YOU JUST GET USED TO IT.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.934
- Man: FUCK YOU, BUCKNER!
- HEY!

16:08.035 --> 16:10.170
- YOU STINK!
- OH, SO DO YOU!

16:10.270 --> 16:12.972
HEY, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, LARRY.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.907
YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE
YOURSELF CRAZY.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.476
SO HOW LONG YOU GONNA
BE AROUND FOR?

16:16.576 --> 16:18.545
YOU WANT TO GO TAKE IN
A COUPLE OF BROADWAY SHOWS?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.480
THERE'S A GOOD ONE
CALLED "NEXT TO NORMAL"

16:20.580 --> 16:23.583
I HEAR A LOT
OF GOOD STUFF ABOUT.
WOMAN HAS A BIPOLAR DISORDER.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.952
COULD I INTERRUPT YOU?
I'VE GOT AN EMERGENCY.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.620
ARE EITHER OF YOU
GENTLEMEN JEWISH?

16:27.720 --> 16:30.523
- NOT ME.
- UH, YEAH, I'M--

16:30.623 --> 16:32.659
LISTEN, I HAVE
A PROBLEM UPSTAIRS.
WE'RE DOING A KADDISH

16:32.759 --> 16:35.495
AND WE NEED ONE MORE GUY
TO FILL OUT THE MINYAN.

16:35.595 --> 16:39.299
- WHAT'S A MINYAN?
- A MINYAN-- WHEN A JEWISH
PERSON DIES

16:39.399 --> 16:42.869
- YOU NEED TO HAVE 10 MEN
IN A ROOM TO SAY A PRAYER.
- IT'LL TAKE 10 MINUTES TOPS.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.338
- I GOT MY FRIEND HERE.
- HE COULD COME ALONG.
IT'S A FREE LUNCH.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.274
YOU COULD HAVE
A LITTLE SANDWICH
WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING.

16:47.374 --> 16:50.077
- IT'S A FREE LUNCH.
- YEAH, IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.112
WE'VE GOT TO GET
TO THE CEMETERY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:52.212 --> 16:53.980
HAVE YOU EVER HAD
JEWISH FOOD BEFORE?

16:54.081 --> 16:56.149
KOUFAX GAVE ME
SOME KISHKA ONE TIME.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.518
- ( laughs ) OKAY.
- SO WE CAN GO THEN?

16:58.618 --> 17:00.287
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.
COME ON.
- LET'S GO.

17:00.387 --> 17:03.123
- GREAT NEWS.
THE MINYAN IS COMPLETE.
- HELLO.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.158
A NICE JEWISH GENTLEMAN
HAS VOLUNTEERED.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.859
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- A PLEASURE.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.196
- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU BOTH--
- SORRY ABOUT WHATEVER HAPPENED.

17:09.296 --> 17:12.332
I DON'T REALLY KNOW,
BUT SOMEBODY OBVIOUSLY DIED.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.034
WE ALL HAVE TO GO
AT SOME POINT.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.736
EXCUSE ME.
WHAT?

17:16.836 --> 17:20.073
HOPEFULLY THERE'S AN AFTERLIFE.
I'LL KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.442
YOU NEVER KNOW.
CRAZIER THINGS, RIGHT?

17:22.542 --> 17:25.145
TERRIBLY SORRY.
ARE YOU BILL BUCKNER?

17:25.245 --> 17:27.880
- YEAH.
- HERMAN HERE IS
FROM BOSTON.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.883
HE'S A BIG RED SOX FAN
AND HE CAN'T BE IN THE SAME
ROOM WITH BILL BUCKNER.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.652
I'LL HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO PLEASE LEAVE.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.355
- I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

17:35.455 --> 17:38.057
- OCTOBER, 1986, TWO OUTS.
- JESUS CHRIST!

17:38.158 --> 17:39.559
LARRY, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT. HEY.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.594
- THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES.
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.963
DON'T LET THE DOOR
GO THROUGH YOUR LEGS
ON THE WAY OUT, BUCKNER.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.567
- WHAT A JERK.
- I ONLY REGRET I CAN'T RUIN
YOUR LIFE BEFORE YOU LEAVE.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.637
HEY, YOU WON TWO WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIPS SINCE THEN.
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?

17:50.737 --> 17:53.072
- Herman: IT SHOULD
HAVE BEEN THREE.
- IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THREE.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.209
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
- I DON'T WANT TO BE IN
YOUR STUPID MINYAN ANYWAY.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.345
- STUPID MINYAN?
MY UNCLE DIED.
- Larry: HOW ABOUT THAT?

17:58.445 --> 18:00.680
I HOPE THERE IS NO AFTERLIFE.
I HOPE THERE'S NO AFTERLIFE.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.049
- SORRY.
- HEY, LARRY, WHAT ABOUT
THE KISHKA?

18:03.150 --> 18:05.118
TO HELL WITH THE KISHKA.
COME ON.

18:06.119 --> 18:08.188
( doorbell rings )

18:09.189 --> 18:10.323
- HEY.
- HELLO.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.958
- COME ON IN.
- HI, LAR.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.060
HEY. FRIEND OF MINE.
YOU MIGHT KNOW HIM.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.763
- DOES HE LOOK FAMILIAR?
- VERY FAMILIAR.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.565
WHO--

18:18.665 --> 18:20.333
MR. BILL BUCKNER.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.001
- BILL BUCKNER!
- HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

18:22.101 --> 18:23.603
HOW DID I NOT--
OH MY GOD.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.439
- WELCOME, BILL BUCKNER.
- BASEBALL PLAYER, RIGHT?

18:26.539 --> 18:29.509
- YEAH. THIS IS SUSIE.
- HI. COME ON IN.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.345
- COME INTO OUR HOME.
- PLAYED FOR THE DODGERS,

18:32.445 --> 18:35.148
- THE CUBS, THE RED SOX.
ANYBODY ELSE?
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.449
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT
WITH THE ANGELS.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.485
ANGELS TOO?
HOW ABOUT THAT?

18:38.585 --> 18:41.154
- YES, I GOT IT.
- THIS VIEW IS AWESOME.
UNBELIEVABLE.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.989
WE MET AT
A BASEBALL CARD SHOW.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.657
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
AT A BASEBALL CARD SHOW?

18:44.757 --> 18:47.694
WHAT WAS I DOING?
'CAUSE SOMEBODY HAS
A LOVING WIFE

18:47.794 --> 18:52.499
AND I PICKED UP
A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR SOMEBODY'S BIRTHDAY.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.467
- COME ON, LET ME SEE.
- GUESS WHOSE NAME
IS ON THERE.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.603
- GUESS WHOSE NAME.
- WHOSE NAME IS ON THERE, HUH?

18:56.703 --> 18:58.305
- WHO'S YOUR FAV?
- MOOKIE WILSON?

18:58.405 --> 19:00.207
- YES.
- OH MY GOD.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.242
DO YOU HAVE THE MOST
THOUGHTFUL WIFE IN THE WORLD?

19:02.342 --> 19:05.178
- THANK YOU.
- IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
IF I DIDN'T GO TO THE SHOW.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.247
- IT WAS MY IDEA.
- YEAH, I DID GO PICK IT UP.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.081
- BUT IT WAS MY IDEA.
- LET ME SEE. LET ME SEE.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.550
- YOU WANT TO SEE IT?
- YEAH, LET ME SEE IT.
LET ME SEE IT.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.285
- HEY, BUCK, CATCH.
- Susie: WHAT?!

19:12.385 --> 19:13.686
- Jeff: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- Susie: WHAT THE FUCK?

19:13.786 --> 19:16.155
- HEY, I'M SORRY. SORRY.
- Susie: WHAT HAPPENED?

19:16.256 --> 19:18.458
- Bill: I MISSED IT, I'M SORRY.
- Susie: IT'S IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE STREET.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.126
LARRY, WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU DOING?

19:20.227 --> 19:22.629
- WHAT? NO.
- WHY'D YOU THROW IT TO HIM?

19:22.729 --> 19:24.864
- YOU KNOW, WE JUST--
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A PROFESSIONAL.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.934
- IT WAS A HORSESHIT THROW.
- NO, IT WAS A HORSESHIT
CATCH ALSO.

19:28.034 --> 19:31.571
HEY, BUCK, COME ON.
IT WAS A GOOD THROW.
YOU BOBBLED IT.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.006
- IT WAS
MOOKIE WILSON, BUCKNER!
- OOH, MOOKIE WILSON.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.775
- YEAH.
- WHAT'D MOOKIE DO?

19:35.875 --> 19:37.210
- ALL HE HIT WAS
A SHITTY GROUND BALL.
- GET THE FUCK OUT!

19:37.310 --> 19:39.246
GET OUT, BOTH OF YOU.
YOU RUINED THE GIFT.

19:39.346 --> 19:42.415
- WHAT HAPPENED?
IT WAS RIGHT IN YOUR HANDS.
- THAT WAS A HORSESHIT THROW.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.218
COME ON, IT WAS IN YOUR HANDS.
HOW COULD YOU MISS THAT BALL?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

19:45.318 --> 19:47.220
- SHIT HAPPENS, LARRY.
- "SHIT HAPPENS"?

19:47.320 --> 19:49.088
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A BASEBALL PLAYER.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.391
YOU CAN'T CATCH
A GODDAMN TOSS?

19:53.192 --> 19:55.462
- WOW, THAT WAS GREAT, HUH?
- THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
THANK YOU.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.164
SO DID YOU DRINK ENOUGH
TO WANT TO COME BACK
TO MY APARTMENT?

19:58.265 --> 19:59.466
- ( laughs )
YES, I THINK I DID.
- REALLY?

19:59.566 --> 20:01.601
FANTASTIC.
TONIGHT I'M GONNA BRING IT.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.102
- I'M NOT JOKING AROUND.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.804
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE CAR.
THE SEAT--

20:04.904 --> 20:07.407
I JUST GOT IT OUT OF THE SHOP
AND IT WASN'T FIXED.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.509
- THE SEAT IS STILL RATTLING.
- CAN I SIT IN IT?

20:09.609 --> 20:12.312
- YEAH, YOU CAN SIT IN IT.
- IT'S FINE. WHATEVER.
IT'S JUST A CAR.

20:15.282 --> 20:17.550
- I ACTUALLY THINK I'M GOING
TO DO VERY WELL TONIGHT.
- ( seat rattling )

20:17.650 --> 20:20.387
- OH?
- I'M JUST PUTTING
IT OUT THERE.

20:20.487 --> 20:24.891
I'LL PUT THE TV ON.
WE'LL START WATCHING TV
AS IF WE'RE GONNA WATCH TV.

20:24.991 --> 20:28.795
BUT I'M REALLY GONNA
TRY AND PUT MOVES ON YOU

20:28.895 --> 20:30.129
WHILE WE'RE WATCHING TV.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.764
- THAT'S SORT OF HOW I DO IT.
- UH-HUH.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.933
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO JUST
SAY, "HEY, LET'S HAVE SEX."

20:34.033 --> 20:35.735
- YOU'VE GOT TO
GO AROUND IT...
- ( gasping )

20:35.835 --> 20:38.838
LIKE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING
ELSE SO YOU FOOL THE WOMAN.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.641
- YEAH.
- IT'S LIKE A MAGIC TRICK.
IT'S SLEIGHT OF HAND.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.176
THE TV KIND OF DIVERTS
YOUR ATTENTION

20:44.277 --> 20:46.713
FROM WHAT
THE REAL AGENDA IS.

20:46.813 --> 20:49.115
ALTHOUGH, DOES IT REALLY?
I MEAN, YOU KNOW AND I KNOW.

20:49.215 --> 20:51.183
- I DON'T KNOW WHY WE HAVE
TO GO THROUGH THIS CHARADE.
- ( gasps )

20:51.284 --> 20:54.554
ANYWAY, I DON'T KNOW.
DO YOU LIKE-- I GOT
SOME MIXED NUTS.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.023
- DO YOU LIKE A MIXED NUT?
- MM-HMM, YES. YEAH.

20:57.123 --> 21:00.259
PEOPLE LIKE A MIXED NUT.
ALTHOUGH WHEN I OPENED
UP THE MIXED NUTS

21:00.360 --> 21:02.429
THEY HAD PUT SOME DRIED
PINEAPPLE IN THERE.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.331
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
WITH THE PINEAPPLE?

21:04.431 --> 21:06.366
IT DOESN'T BLEND WELL
WITH THE MIXED NUTS.

21:06.466 --> 21:09.001
THE DRIED PINEAPPLE
IS DESTROYING MIXED NUTS.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.538
- ( moans )
- FOR ME, GIVE ME
A CHIP ANY DAY.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.039
- DO YOU LIKE CHIPS?
- YEAH YEAH.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.041
- YOU LIKE A GOOD CHIP?
- YES. YES.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.676
WHAT ABOUT A DIP?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.711
- DO YOU LIKE A DIP
AS WELL AS A CHIP?
- YES! YES!

21:18.811 --> 21:20.813
- YOU LIKE A CHIP
AND A DIP?
- YES!

21:20.913 --> 21:23.115
- RIGHT?
- YES! OOH!

21:23.215 --> 21:25.785
- BAD NEWS, I HAVE NO DIP.
- ( moaning )

21:25.885 --> 21:27.387
I AM SO SORRY.

21:27.487 --> 21:30.790
- I AM COMPLETELY DIPLESS.
- ( panting )

21:30.890 --> 21:32.892
OH MY GOD, IS THIS
A PARKING SPACE?

21:32.992 --> 21:34.794
HO HO HO!

21:34.894 --> 21:38.264
THIS IS MY LUCKY DAY.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.700
UNBELIEVABLE.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.803
WOULD YOU MIND
DRIVING ME HOME?

21:44.837 --> 21:46.305
WHAT?

21:46.406 --> 21:49.208
I'M KIND OF DONE.
I THINK I NEED TO
CALL IT A NIGHT.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.345
- DRIVE YOU HOME?
- I MEAN IF IT'S OKAY.

21:52.445 --> 21:55.815
WHY? I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA COME UPSTAIRS.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.450
I'M JUST KIND OF READY
FOR BED, YOU KNOW?

21:57.550 --> 22:00.319
- I'M READY TO DO THE JOB.
- I'M SURE YOU ARE.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.188
- I'M SURE YOU ARE.
- AND I HAVE THIS THEORY.

22:02.288 --> 22:03.923
LIKE FOR GOLF,
WHEN I HAVE A BAD ROUND,

22:04.023 --> 22:07.193
MY NEXT ROUND IS FANTASTIC
BECAUSE I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

22:07.293 --> 22:10.096
I HIT THE LOW POINT.
LIKE, I HIT THE LOW POINT
THE LAST TIME.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.264
AND NOW I KNOW
THAT I STINK.

22:12.365 --> 22:13.700
AND WHEN I FEEL
I STINK I'M GOOD.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.368
WELL, LET'S GO
FOR IT ANOTHER NIGHT.

22:15.468 --> 22:18.170
( emphatically )
I AM DONE.

22:18.270 --> 22:21.107
ALL RIGHT. ( sighs )
I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.546
Larry:
SO SHE SAID
SHE CHANGED HER MIND.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.981
NO MAN WOULD EVER
CHANGE HIS MIND,
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.451
I'M VERY CURIOUS TO KNOW
WHY SHE WOULD DO THAT.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.754
WHY? I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IMPOTENT,
WOMEN TREAT YOU LIKE A LEPER.

22:34.854 --> 22:38.625
YOU TRIED TO PUT
A NOODLE IN A WOMAN?
WOMEN HATE THAT, MAN.

22:38.725 --> 22:41.861
THAT'S A REMARKABLY IDIOTIC
THING THAT YOU JUST SAID.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.831
BUT YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT
YOU'RE WEARING GLASSES,

22:44.931 --> 22:48.401
I PERCEIVE IT
AS A LITTLE LESS IDIOTIC
THAN I NORMALLY WOULD.

22:48.501 --> 22:49.836
- IT'S INTERESTING.
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.671
- I'M MAKING SENSE.
- SLIGHTLY LESS STUPID.

22:51.771 --> 22:54.574
- YOU'RE MAKING A LITTLE SENSE.
- I'M MAKING STUPID SENSE.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.509
HUH?

22:58.478 --> 23:00.547
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

23:00.647 --> 23:03.683
A BILL
FROM THE THERAPIST?

23:03.783 --> 23:06.986
I THINK HE CHARGED ME
FOR TALKING TO HIM
AT THE CARD SHOW.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.456
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU GOT
TO HANDLE, MAN. YOU KNOW?

23:09.556 --> 23:11.458
- YOU WANT TO TAKE A RIDE?
- WHERE WE GOING AT?

23:11.558 --> 23:14.861
- I WANT TO TALK TO
THIS THERAPIST.
- LET'S DO IT.

23:14.961 --> 23:17.096
( seat rattling )

23:22.334 --> 23:25.004
MMM.
MMM.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.073
( exhales )

23:27.173 --> 23:29.642
WHAT'S WITH YOU?

23:32.178 --> 23:34.914
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I FIGURED
THIS SHIT OUT.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.817
SHE WAS GETTING HER ROCKS OFF
IN THIS DAMN CHAIR.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.418
- LOOK AT ME.
- REALLY?

23:39.519 --> 23:41.621
THIS SHIT IS
A MOVING DILDO.

23:41.721 --> 23:44.390
- YOU MEAN LIKE A HORSE?
- THIS CHAIR IS A FUCK MACHINE.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.759
MAN CANNOT COMPETE
WITH MACHINERY.

23:46.859 --> 23:49.028
NO WONDER WHY
SHE DIDN'T COME UPSTAIRS.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.030
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.
SHE WAS COMING DOWNSTAIRS.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.633
- YOU GET IT?
- SHE WAS COMING DOWNSTAIRS.

23:53.733 --> 23:55.267
- YES, I GET IT.
- GETTING HER SHIT OFF.

23:55.367 --> 23:58.237
WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU DO,
YOU KEEP HER OUT
OF THIS DAMN CAR.

23:58.337 --> 23:59.806
YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS CAR IS?

23:59.906 --> 24:02.108
THIS CAR IS
THE OTHER FUCKING MAN.

24:02.208 --> 24:05.512
SHE IS CHEATING ON YOU
WITH THIS FUCKING CHAIR.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.583
- Larry: AH.
- LARRY.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.018
- HI.
- HI.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.320
I KNOW I DON'T HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT NOW,

24:14.420 --> 24:16.556
BUT I GOT A BILL
IN THE MAIL TODAY.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.458
AM I TO UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU CHARGED ME

24:19.559 --> 24:22.428
FOR TALKING TO ME ON LINE
AT THE BASEBALL CARD SHOW?

24:22.529 --> 24:25.431
- IS THAT POSSIBLE?
- WELL, YES IT IS.

24:25.532 --> 24:29.335
DR. THURGOOD, WE SPOKE
FOR ALL OF THREE MINUTES.

24:29.435 --> 24:31.203
WELL, LET ME JUST
POINT OUT TO YOU, LARRY,

24:31.303 --> 24:33.640
THAT SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE
SUFFER WITH WHAT I MIGHT CALL

24:33.740 --> 24:36.576
THE MORE DRAMATIC FORMS
OF NARCISSISM,

24:36.676 --> 24:38.811
THEY HAVE A HARD TIME GAUGING
HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN TALKING

24:38.911 --> 24:40.880
ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS
OR THEMSELVES.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.582
ARE YOU SAYING
I'M A NARCISSIST?

24:42.682 --> 24:46.252
LARRY, MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU
UNDERSTAND THIS WAY.

24:46.352 --> 24:50.690
I HAD A CLIENT.
HE WAS QUITE AN ILLUSTRIOUS
WELL-KNOWN DIRECTOR.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.560
I DON'T WANT TO REVEAL
WHO HE WAS, BUT HE DID
DIRECT "STAR WARS."

24:53.660 --> 24:55.294
AND HE ENJOYED

24:55.394 --> 24:57.930
IN HIS REPERTOIRE
OF THINGS THAT HE LIKED

24:58.030 --> 25:00.366
TO SEE PROSTITUTES.

25:00.466 --> 25:02.935
NOW IN THAT PARTICULAR
SITUATION,

25:03.035 --> 25:05.437
IF HE WERE TO HIRE A PROSTITUTE,
LET'S SAY FOR AN HOUR,

25:05.538 --> 25:07.840
- WHICH WAS NORMAL FOR HIM--
- YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL HIM
GEORGE LUCAS.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.609
I MEAN, THAT'S WHO
DIRECTED "STAR WARS."

25:09.709 --> 25:11.243
WELL, I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.379
- I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT.
- YOU JUST TOLD ME WHO IT WAS.

25:13.479 --> 25:16.983
I MERELY ALLUDED
TO THE FACT THAT HE WAS
A WELL-KNOWN DIRECTOR.

25:17.083 --> 25:20.753
NOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE
NEEDED TO COMPLETE HIS WORK--

25:20.853 --> 25:22.789
EVERYBODY KNOWS
WHO DIRECTED "STAR WARS."

25:22.889 --> 25:24.824
NOT EVERYONE IS IN
SHOW BUSINESS, LARRY.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.793
- OKAY, GO AHEAD.
- MY POINT IS--

25:26.893 --> 25:30.229
- GOD KNOWS WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT ME.
- NO ONE ASKS ABOUT YOU.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.632
I DIDN'T ASK ABOUT GEORGE LUCAS
BUT YOU JUST BROUGHT HIM UP.

25:32.732 --> 25:35.668
I MERELY SAID
A WELL-KNOWN DIRECTOR.
AND HERE'S MY POINT.

25:35.768 --> 25:38.070
HE USED TO FREQUENT
PROSTITUTES.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.840
AND VERY OFTEN HE WOULD
HIRE THEM FOR AN HOUR,

25:40.940 --> 25:42.909
WHICH WAS THEIR MINIMUM,
BUT IT ONLY TOOK HIM

25:43.009 --> 25:44.677
THREE OR FOUR
OR MAYBE FIVE MINUTES

25:44.777 --> 25:47.046
TO COMPLETE THE SHOT,
IF YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING.

25:47.146 --> 25:50.516
HOWEVER, THEY CONSIDERED IT
FAIR AND HE CONSIDERED IT FAIR

25:50.617 --> 25:53.185
TO PAY THEM FOR THE FULL HOUR.
THAT WAS THE WAY
THEY DID BUSINESS.

25:53.285 --> 25:56.255
FIRST OFF, I'M APPALLED
BY WHAT YOU JUST SAID TO ME.

25:56.355 --> 25:57.690
HE HAS A RIGHT
TO DO WHAT HE WANTS.
HE'S AN ADULT.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.358
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE CONFIDENTIAL.

25:59.458 --> 26:00.760
- IT IS.
- YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE TELLING PEOPLE.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.629
IT'S MERELY BY WAY
OF ILLUSTRATION.

26:02.729 --> 26:05.932
MY POINT IS THAT
PEOPLE NEED VARIOUS THINGS
TO HELP THEM FUNCTION.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.834
AND MY HOPE WAS THAT
I WAS DOING THAT FOR YOU.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.802
WELL, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.871
YES, AND CONGRATULATIONS,
DOCTOR.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.774
I THINK YOU'VE STUMBLED
UPON THE PERFECT ANALOGY

26:14.874 --> 26:16.743
FOR EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO.

26:16.843 --> 26:19.311
WELL, IT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
A HOBBY AND A PROFESSION

26:19.411 --> 26:20.680
FOR ME JUST
AS IT IS FOR THEM.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.181
- MM-HMM.
- GOOD SEEING YOU.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.350
OKAY.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.987
WHEW.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:28.087 --> 26:30.456
LET ME GO IN AND GIVE IT
A SHOT WITH THE GLASSES ON.

26:30.556 --> 26:32.258
I REALLY DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA WORK.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.026
- LET ME GO GIVE IT A SHOT.
- GO AHEAD, GIVE IT A SHOT.

26:34.126 --> 26:36.996
GIVE ME THAT BILL, MAN.
FUCKING AROUND.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.868
