00:20.020 --> 00:24.274
- Father, he's coming.
- Yes, I know. You are not to be here.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.985
- But father...
- Go. Now.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.253
After all this time, it is really you.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.297
Ma'kar of the Gomai foothills.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.260
Teal'c.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.808
You are the one called Rak'nor.

01:00.102 --> 01:03.355
- It is an honour to finally meet you.
- And I you.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.660
We have heard much
of your return to Chulak.

01:16.827 --> 01:20.497
It is time for Jaffa to stop
whispering about freedom...

01:20.622 --> 01:22.749
..and begin to show our true power.

01:22.875 --> 01:26.628
A power we can only hope
is greater than that of the gods.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.298
False gods.

01:30.174 --> 01:33.510
Their power is real,
and stronger than ever.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.680
Even Heru-ur and the other
System Lords now fear Apophis.

01:36.805 --> 01:40.392
- He commands the vast army of Sokar.
- An army of Jaffa.

01:40.726 --> 01:44.980
You know of what happened here
on Chulak, at the hands of Apophis.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.816
Yes, I know how many were slaughtered.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.820
But I also know that those left alive
are ready to rise against him.

01:51.945 --> 01:56.408
Jaffa are the foundation upon which
the false gods have built their empires.

01:56.533 --> 02:00.120
- We can tear them down.
- But we will have to fight our own kind.

02:00.329 --> 02:04.416
As the Goa'uld have forced us to do in
their name for countless generations.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.169
Only now, we will fight for
the freedom of all Jaffa.

02:07.252 --> 02:10.506
Rak'nor has the loyalty of
a great many here on Chulak.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.592
So Bra'tac has heard from you,
and I from him.

02:15.761 --> 02:20.015
It is the word of our friend Ma'kar
that has brought me here this night.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.976
In their hearts,
many Jaffa believe as we do.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.939
Those with the strength
and the courage must speak out.

02:27.022 --> 02:29.233
We must fear the Goa'uld no longer.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.737
Those who wish to join
our cause must be united.

02:34.530 --> 02:37.866
Kol'na of the high cliffs
and Hak'nor of the Cordai plains...

02:37.950 --> 02:41.370
..have already agreed to meet
at the Chamka groves tomorrow.

02:42.538 --> 02:45.541
Then I will meet with them as well.

02:47.459 --> 02:51.505
And this blasphemous rebellion
will finally be crushed.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.342
Hashak kree.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.646
Shol'va.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.159
Receiving IDC transmission.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.913
- It's the Tok'ra.
- Open the iris.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.715
- Teal'c?
- Tok'ra.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.843
Too bad.

05:01.844 --> 05:06.723
There's no traveller en route, sir.
However, a transmission is being sent.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.851
Looks like my vacation is over.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.650
Thanks to Tanith, the Tok'ra
intercepted this conversation...

05:16.733 --> 05:18.944
..between Apophis and Heru-ur.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.238
It took place less than an hour ago.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.740
(distorted voice)

05:28.704 --> 05:30.998
It sounds like they've agreed to meet.

05:31.123 --> 05:35.669
(as Selmak) Currently, Heru-ur is allied
with the System Lords against Apophis.

05:36.128 --> 05:39.047
- Or so the System Lords presume.
- Exactly.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.425
An alliance between
Apophis and Heru-ur...

05:41.550 --> 05:44.178
..could overwhelm
all the other System Lords.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.971
And that would be bad?

05:46.096 --> 05:48.640
One enemy is easier to target than many.

05:49.433 --> 05:52.144
Our spies believe Apophis
agreed to the meeting...

05:52.227 --> 05:55.981
..because he would use this alliance
to topple the System Lords,...

05:56.064 --> 05:58.692
..after which he will deal with Heru-ur.

05:59.401 --> 06:02.321
- If he succeeds...
- Galactic badness. Huge.

06:02.613 --> 06:06.116
- So what do we do?
- Find a way to sabotage the alliance.

06:08.911 --> 06:12.581
(Selmak) Dr Jackson, have you seen
symbols like this before?

06:13.248 --> 06:16.251
Looks similar to Phoenician letters,
but I can't be sure.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.587
We believe it is a technical manual.

06:18.712 --> 06:22.382
None of our Tok'ra linguists
could translate it.

06:25.135 --> 06:29.389
Excuse my denseness, but what
does this have to do with anything?

06:29.681 --> 06:33.602
The hatred and mistrust between Apophis
and Heru-ur goes back a long time.

06:33.727 --> 06:39.107
- If we can get them to fight each other...
- They both control the largest armies.

06:39.191 --> 06:41.735
A war between them would
decimate both sides...

06:41.818 --> 06:44.821
..and return the balance of power
to the System Lords,...

06:44.905 --> 06:49.201
..which for now is much more preferable
to one all-powerful Goa'uld.

06:49.451 --> 06:56.834
I think I've got it. It's three to the blue,
four to the orange, and three to the blue.

06:57.042 --> 07:00.629
That sounds like some sort of
colour-coded combination for a lock.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.590
Excellent. We may have a chance now.

07:04.383 --> 07:09.096
- If you will accompany me...
- Ah! Wait a minute. Hold it right there.

07:09.221 --> 07:13.767
If you're about to say you'll explain
along the way, I'm gonna lose it.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.854
I've about had it with the way
the Tok'ra do business.

07:16.937 --> 07:21.233
I wanna know exactly what we're dealing
with here, every mission detail,...

07:21.358 --> 07:23.902
..or we go nowhere.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.447
(as Jacob) I was gonna tell you, Jack.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.160
OK. Never mind.

07:36.707 --> 07:40.752
The meeting will take place in a region
of space known as the Tobin system.

07:40.836 --> 07:45.549
The Tobin civilisation began on earth and
has been extinct for several centuries,...

07:45.632 --> 07:50.512
..but one of their legacies is the
equivalent of a large minefield in space.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.515
As close as you can get
to neutral territory, sir.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.894
The mines, designed to protect
the planet, will hone in...

07:56.977 --> 08:00.814
..on various energy signatures,
including that of Goa'uld weaponry.

08:00.898 --> 08:05.444
If Heru-ur or Apophis decided to open fire,
they would be destroyed by the mines.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.571
We'll take the cargo ship I came in.

08:07.696 --> 08:10.782
If we leave now, we can get
there before the meeting,...

08:10.866 --> 08:13.869
..and reprogram a mine
to target Apophis's ship.

08:14.077 --> 08:17.414
- So you think Heru-ur is behind it.
- Exactly.

08:17.539 --> 08:21.835
The problem is that the mines are in
constant motion, repositioning randomly.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.588
So how can you reprogram one?

08:24.671 --> 08:27.508
That's a little bit of a concern for me, sir.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.552
The mines have sophisticated engines...

08:30.677 --> 08:33.514
..that are unaffected
by gravitational conditions.

08:33.597 --> 08:37.893
We should be able to safely use the cargo
ship's rings to pull a mine inside.

08:37.976 --> 08:41.395
At which point, I'll pilot the ship
to match its movement.

08:41.522 --> 08:45.817
The Tok'ra have what they believe is
the Tobin manual for how the mines work.

08:45.943 --> 08:49.112
Aspects of the translation
have previously eluded us.

08:49.238 --> 08:53.158
Now, with Dr Jackson's help, we can use
the manual to reprogram the mine...

08:53.242 --> 08:56.411
..to hone in on a specific
energy signature.

08:56.537 --> 09:00.290
One of our operators on Apophis's
ship will have planted a beacon...

09:00.374 --> 09:02.918
..that will broadcast that energy signature.

09:03.001 --> 09:07.297
The mine thinks Apophis's ship is firing a
weapon, moves towards it and explodes.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.967
Sounds very risky.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.427
"Insane" might be another word.

09:13.011 --> 09:17.724
I'll need Dr Jackson, and there may be
some complicated calculations,...

09:17.808 --> 09:20.519
..so Sam would be a big help, too.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.356
(clears throat)

09:24.439 --> 09:28.026
Of course, Colonel O'Neill
is always fun to have around.

09:31.363 --> 09:34.533
- The timing is critical, George.
- Then you have a go.

10:08.734 --> 10:11.820
Do not think your punishment
is over, shol'va.

10:11.904 --> 10:13.947
Back away!

10:15.032 --> 10:17.951
Welcome, Teal'c. I am Terok.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.205
(yells)

10:23.749 --> 10:28.545
Who do you suppose
is more well known among Jaffa?

10:30.422 --> 10:32.466
You?

10:33.634 --> 10:34.718
Or l?

10:34.843 --> 10:37.304
- Terok or the shol'va?
- Many know of Teal'c,...

10:37.429 --> 10:39.389
..but all Jaffa fear you, my Lord.

10:39.515 --> 10:43.435
After all, I have been around
much, much longer.

10:45.687 --> 10:49.775
And from the looks of things, I will
be around long after you are gone.

10:59.076 --> 11:02.746
From this moment on,
every tear you shed...

11:06.333 --> 11:08.377
..will be recorded...

11:09.920 --> 11:13.757
..so that all Jaffa,
alive now and for evermore,...

11:15.050 --> 11:20.514
..will see how weak and powerless
the great and mighty Teal'c really was...

11:20.597 --> 11:22.641
..before he died.

11:25.477 --> 11:30.899
They will see how he came to understand
how wrong he was about the Goa'uld.

11:32.484 --> 11:37.281
We will see you pray to the gods
for forgiveness...

11:37.364 --> 11:40.868
..and beg to be granted
an honourable death.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.288
Never.

11:44.413 --> 11:49.376
Let us not argue about the future.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.838
(screams)

12:00.929 --> 12:02.973
- Where is he?
- He's on 18.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.810
Jacob, do you really think
the Goa'uld are stupid enough...

12:06.935 --> 12:09.062
..to fire on each other in a minefield?

12:09.188 --> 12:13.108
No. We don't want them to. The goal
is to get them into an all-out war,...

12:13.233 --> 12:17.279
- ..where their fleets will be weakened.
- Do you think that's gonna happen?

12:17.362 --> 12:20.866
If he were ambushed by Heru-ur,
Apophis would most likely retreat.

12:20.991 --> 12:25.454
But his next move will be to order
his armies to attack Heru-ur's planet.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.461
- What are you doing?
- I could use a hand here.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.379
Sure you've got everything?

12:34.463 --> 12:36.840
Can you reprogram a mine
with no translation?

12:36.965 --> 12:38.842
- Thought of a laptop?
- I have one.

12:38.926 --> 12:44.056
I couldn't find Beck's Ancient Phoenician
Symbology on CD at Archaeology.com.

13:02.324 --> 13:04.451
Still go with the gold, huh?

13:06.286 --> 13:09.790
- Did you do something different here?
- I had the bulkhead removed.

13:09.915 --> 13:14.628
Once we've moved the mine inside, we're
gonna need all the room we can get.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.215
What about the escape pods?

13:18.966 --> 13:21.343
If that mine touches anything in here,...

13:21.426 --> 13:24.388
..the escape pods aren't
gonna do us any good.

13:26.557 --> 13:27.558
Oh.

13:47.703 --> 13:49.746
Do you understand any of that?

13:50.789 --> 13:52.833
It's all Phoenician to me, sir.

14:01.175 --> 14:03.719
Drink. It is only water.

14:05.804 --> 14:08.473
Do you not drink because
you wish to die sooner?

14:13.645 --> 14:16.190
It is not recording now.

14:16.273 --> 14:19.526
You will not appear weak
by quenching your thirst.

14:21.737 --> 14:26.366
You know Terok will not let you die before
he has gotten what he wants from you.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.872
I swear on my father's name
that this is only water.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.505
What is the name of your father?

14:40.589 --> 14:44.968
Swearing on his name means nothing
if you do not know who he was.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.888
My father was called Delnor.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.893
- I know that name.
- When you were first prime,...

14:52.976 --> 14:56.730
..you spared his life
after Apophis ordered him killed.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.357
I remember.

14:58.440 --> 15:02.528
When you turned against Apophis,
my father believed it was a sign.

15:02.611 --> 15:06.114
He spoke out against the gods
and supported you.

15:06.198 --> 15:09.284
He seared the mark of the serpent
from my forehead.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.370
He...

15:11.495 --> 15:14.248
- He said I was free.
- You are.

15:15.374 --> 15:20.170
Other Jaffa warriors also began to believe.
Like my father, they followed Bra'tac,...

15:20.295 --> 15:23.715
..who said what you had done
would begin a Jaffa rebellion.

15:24.758 --> 15:29.471
He said that one day, all Jaffa would be
free from enslavement by the Goa'uld.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.391
- He spoke the truth.
- No, it was blasphemy.

15:32.474 --> 15:35.978
The Goa'uld are gods. Look at yourself
now. Why will you not admit it?

15:36.103 --> 15:38.230
Why do you not believe
as your father did?

15:38.397 --> 15:41.650
My father believes nothing any more.
He is dead.

15:41.775 --> 15:47.281
My father was a stupid fool. And Apophis
killed my whole family because of it.

15:47.364 --> 15:52.161
He who died himself and was reborn
returned to slay Sokar.

15:52.244 --> 15:55.414
He, with the power to slaughter
millions in an instant,...

15:55.539 --> 15:58.709
..who commands the greatest
army the Goa'uld have known,...

15:58.834 --> 16:00.961
..how can he be anything but a god?

16:03.213 --> 16:07.134
I was fortunate enough to realise
that in time to save myself.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.681
Listen to Rak'nor, Teal'c.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.689
No one can save you but yourself.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.574
Not even Bra'tac lasted this long.

16:34.995 --> 16:38.081
With pitiful tears
streaming down his face,...

16:39.917 --> 16:42.628
..he admitted we were all-powerful gods.

16:42.836 --> 16:48.258
- He would die first.
- He did die, Teal'c... but not first.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.594
First, he prayed to me.

16:51.678 --> 16:56.308
He prayed to the Goa'uld
for forgiveness,...

16:59.394 --> 17:01.605
..as you will.

17:23.752 --> 17:26.672
(screams)

17:54.575 --> 17:57.119
We've reached the Tobin system.

17:59.872 --> 18:02.332
Wow. That's a lot of mines.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.668
Hundreds of thousands.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.671
(Jacob) Prepare to activate the rings.

18:17.931 --> 18:21.351
Jacob. What's with the... ear thing?

18:21.643 --> 18:26.607
It's a heads-up display to help me fly the
ship while keeping the mine in the hold.

18:30.319 --> 18:32.696
And how hard is that gonna be?

18:33.363 --> 18:37.993
Considering what I have
to avoid out there... hard.

19:09.483 --> 19:11.527
Clear the rings.

19:24.748 --> 19:26.792
Now, Sam.

19:37.386 --> 19:39.429
All right, get on it.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.282
Uh-oh.

19:58.866 --> 20:00.909
What?

20:02.703 --> 20:05.372
Don't you recognise the symbols?

20:07.332 --> 20:09.376
What symbols?

20:12.754 --> 20:17.384
Save yourself, Teal'c. It is not too late.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.931
(Terok roars)

20:31.190 --> 20:33.942
One second longer,
and you would be dead.

20:39.781 --> 20:42.784
Why admit the Goa'uld are gods?

20:46.288 --> 20:49.791
Why do I waste my time?

20:55.547 --> 20:57.591
Because it is the truth.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.769
I do this for one reason.

21:08.894 --> 21:11.271
Not to break you.

21:11.396 --> 21:13.690
Not to torture you.

21:14.608 --> 21:17.069
I do this to save you.

21:18.695 --> 21:23.826
Maybe you do not fear me,
or even death itself,...

21:23.909 --> 21:28.038
..but you should fear
what awaits beyond if you die this way.

21:34.837 --> 21:36.964
Sha mel kalak.

21:38.757 --> 21:41.635
Say what needs to be said...

21:42.177 --> 21:48.934
..to deliver your soul and the souls of
all those that have embraced your sin.

21:54.606 --> 21:57.776
Kree shac, chel nok.

21:57.901 --> 22:01.572
(Terok roars)

22:24.136 --> 22:28.223
There should be a panel that opens
and allows access to the inside.

22:28.307 --> 22:30.184
Try underneath.

22:30.309 --> 22:36.148
I think there's something here, Dad,
but can you raise the bomb any higher?

22:43.197 --> 22:45.866
(Carter)
It looks like a circle with a cross in it.

22:45.949 --> 22:47.659
Uh... that could be it.

22:49.870 --> 22:53.790
- OK, what do I do?
- I'm pretty sure you touch it.

22:53.874 --> 22:55.250
"Pretty sure"?

22:55.334 --> 22:59.546
The last time a Tok'ra was sent to attempt
this, they were never heard from again.

23:00.714 --> 23:03.467
- Well, that's news.
- No, I think that's it.

23:04.301 --> 23:06.345
You "think".

23:07.679 --> 23:10.682
OK, I'm... I'm... sure that's it.

23:19.316 --> 23:21.360
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Hey!

23:21.568 --> 23:24.279
No, sorry. That's it. I'm sure.

23:45.717 --> 23:48.679
Don't touch it anywhere
but inside the opening.

23:51.890 --> 23:54.184
Daniel, what do these mean?

23:58.063 --> 24:02.109
Those indicate the various frequencies
that the mine is sensitive to.

24:02.776 --> 24:06.196
So we need to erase them all
and input only the one we want.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.490
Right.

24:10.367 --> 24:13.078
How long is this gonna take, kids?

24:13.162 --> 24:15.205
I have no idea.

24:34.725 --> 24:37.019
Terok grows frustrated by you.

24:37.769 --> 24:41.106
He thought he was recording
my humiliation.

24:41.190 --> 24:44.151
Instead, he was only recording his own.

24:44.359 --> 24:47.946
Do you not believe your soul
will be forever punished?

24:49.948 --> 24:51.992
The Goa'uld are parasites.

24:53.285 --> 24:57.748
They use Jaffa as incubators until
they are ready to take human hosts.

25:00.542 --> 25:03.712
I have seen the world
from which they originated.

25:05.672 --> 25:09.968
I have stood beside the swamps
from which they first rose.

25:10.385 --> 25:13.055
They are really flesh and blood,
just like you or l.

25:13.138 --> 25:15.766
- Lies.
- Why would I lie?

25:16.350 --> 25:19.061
If there was a chance
that they were gods,...

25:19.144 --> 25:23.607
..if I thought my soul would be
forever punished, why would I lie?

25:26.026 --> 25:28.153
They have manipulated our bodies.

25:28.278 --> 25:32.199
So, too, are they manipulating
our minds with false beliefs.

25:32.324 --> 25:34.868
You believe this so strongly
you would die in sin?

25:35.035 --> 25:40.874
I believe it so strongly that I fight to live
with every last bit of strength that I have.

25:40.958 --> 25:44.378
So that one day, enough Jaffa
will believe as I do.

25:46.046 --> 25:50.300
Enough to end the Goa'uld,
and free us all for ever.

25:59.601 --> 26:03.188
OK. Three to the blue.

26:03.730 --> 26:07.818
- Which way is blue?
- That's a good question.

26:11.530 --> 26:13.740
OK. Clockwise is blue.

26:13.824 --> 26:16.201
Three notches.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.792
OK. Four to the orange.

26:36.305 --> 26:38.348
Three to the blue.

26:40.851 --> 26:42.811
Uh, Dad.

26:43.729 --> 26:45.105
Jacob.

26:53.197 --> 26:55.407
- Jacob!
- I know. I have a problem here.

27:00.996 --> 27:03.207
Jacob!

27:23.227 --> 27:25.354
So, Jacob... nice flying.

27:25.521 --> 27:27.564
Thanks.

27:29.191 --> 27:31.652
- How much longer?
- Not sure. Why?

27:32.444 --> 27:34.404
Someone's coming.

27:38.325 --> 27:40.702
I'm cloaking the ship.

27:56.343 --> 27:58.804
It's Apophis.

27:59.179 --> 28:01.849
Three to blue.

28:08.105 --> 28:11.859
- It's flashing green. Green is good?
- No.

28:12.192 --> 28:13.819
- Bad.
- Bad.

28:13.902 --> 28:15.529
- How bad?
- Very, very bad.

28:15.612 --> 28:19.533
Dad! I'm needing Selmak's help here.

28:19.658 --> 28:23.078
All right. Jack! You're gonna
have to take the stick.

28:23.871 --> 28:26.331
What? Really?

28:26.999 --> 28:29.042
Take the HUD.

28:29.877 --> 28:34.256
Keep the mine centre-circle,
and avoid hitting anything out there.

28:35.841 --> 28:37.384
OK, I got it.

28:41.096 --> 28:42.181
Whoa, whoa!

28:42.639 --> 28:44.683
- Huh?
- I'm cool. I'm all right.

28:49.062 --> 28:51.106
Not so easy.

28:54.276 --> 28:57.362
- What's goin' on?
- The crystals are flashing green.

28:57.487 --> 28:59.865
- I think it's gonna explode.
- Deactivate it.

29:00.199 --> 29:04.286
I don't know how. If you enter the wrong
combination, a fail-safe is enacted.

29:04.369 --> 29:08.415
You have five minutes to enter the right
combination, or the mine explodes.

29:08.624 --> 29:13.504
Apophis is here. If we release the mine
and it explodes, the mission is ruined.

29:13.587 --> 29:15.964
If we don't release the
mine now, we're ruined.

29:16.089 --> 29:20.010
- Then enter the right combination.
- We tried. What does Selmak say?

29:20.219 --> 29:22.888
- Try again.
- Very helpful.

29:32.397 --> 29:34.441
Bring him!

30:09.726 --> 30:12.020
My Lord, Heru-ur hails you.

30:16.775 --> 30:18.819
Kree shac chel, Apophis.

30:27.202 --> 30:32.249
- Heru-ur's ship is here.
- (Apophis's voice on loudspeaker)

30:32.958 --> 30:35.419
Onak kla keela jarook.

30:37.713 --> 30:39.756
Machello koma ashma.

30:40.174 --> 30:43.427
Heru-ur says Apophis's forces
are not yet great enough...

30:43.552 --> 30:46.805
..to match the collective army
of the System Lords.

30:46.889 --> 30:51.768
With his assistance, the battle
will be swift and end in their favour.

30:51.894 --> 30:53.353
Apophis?

30:53.437 --> 30:56.523
He wants to know what
Heru-ur wants in exchange.

30:56.648 --> 30:58.692
(Heru-urspeaks)

31:00.360 --> 31:05.157
Heru-ur wants to maintain dominion
over all that is currently his,...

31:05.240 --> 31:07.910
..plus that which is
currently owned by Cronus.

31:07.993 --> 31:10.662
He has to know Apophis'll
screw him eventually.

31:10.746 --> 31:15.459
Heru-ur is offering Apophis a gift,
a token to show his honour and loyalty.

31:15.584 --> 31:20.797
After Apophis accepts, they will swear
an oath to solidify their bond.

31:23.258 --> 31:25.302
What's he offering?

31:39.107 --> 31:41.151
Ona rac shol'va.

31:54.665 --> 31:56.708
Teal'c.

32:02.881 --> 32:05.592
Teal'c's on Chulak.

32:05.676 --> 32:07.719
Apparently not.

32:08.470 --> 32:11.348
Apophis is thinking the whole deal over.

32:11.431 --> 32:14.935
As soon as he makes up his mind,
the transfer will take place.

32:15.018 --> 32:17.062
Damn it, this is not working.

32:17.187 --> 32:20.774
It doesn't make any sense.
It clearly says "three to the blue,...

32:20.899 --> 32:23.360
..four to the orange and three to the blue."

32:23.902 --> 32:26.864
- How much time do we have?
- Less than a minute.

32:27.364 --> 32:31.618
OK. These are Tobin numbers.
This is one. This is two. This is three...

32:31.702 --> 32:33.996
Wait, wait. What about zero?

32:34.913 --> 32:37.749
- What?
- Zero. Why didn't you say "zero"?

32:38.458 --> 32:41.378
There is no zero
in the Phoenician numerical system.

32:41.587 --> 32:43.881
What if the Tobins added it?

32:45.048 --> 32:46.675
He's right.

32:46.800 --> 32:50.387
Inventing technology of this
sophistication would require a zero.

32:50.512 --> 32:53.849
- Why?
- Just trust me. It's a math thing.

32:55.434 --> 32:59.563
- So I've been off by one this whole time.
- Thirty seconds.

32:59.646 --> 33:01.607
Well, OK, then.

33:01.732 --> 33:05.319
Two to the blue, three to
the orange, and two to the blue.

33:12.784 --> 33:14.828
That's it.

33:17.039 --> 33:19.082
They got it.

33:21.293 --> 33:23.420
Now we enter the right frequency.

33:37.768 --> 33:39.978
There is little time for you.

33:41.021 --> 33:46.693
If you repent now, I will save
your soul and end your suffering.

33:51.740 --> 33:54.701
So that Apophis can revive me
and begin again?

33:55.786 --> 33:57.830
(laughs)

34:12.302 --> 34:15.179
You know what'll happen to Teal'c
if Apophis gets him.

34:15.347 --> 34:18.433
Anything we do in attempting
a rescue will give us away.

34:18.559 --> 34:21.228
- Yeah. So?
- So?

34:21.311 --> 34:24.273
You know as well as I do
that bigger things are at stake.

34:24.356 --> 34:30.112
He's your friend, I know. But we've both
had to deal with losses like this in battle.

34:30.779 --> 34:33.239
Tok'ra operatives have given their lives...

34:33.322 --> 34:38.120
..and others are at great risk on those
ships now, all for the sake of this mission.

34:38.245 --> 34:42.166
I'm sorry, Colonel...
but Teal'c is expendable.

34:44.751 --> 34:48.839
One, two, three... now.

34:52.426 --> 34:54.469
We're done.

35:00.726 --> 35:02.769
All right, I have to deploy.

35:06.940 --> 35:09.484
- If they start shootin'...
- They better not yet.

35:09.610 --> 35:12.488
We're still in the middle of this minefield.

35:13.906 --> 35:14.907
Deploy.

35:26.251 --> 35:30.547
- Nothing's happening.
- Maybe our operative was compromised.

35:30.797 --> 35:33.008
Or we reprogrammed the mine wrong.

35:34.426 --> 35:38.180
No, I'm... sure we reprogrammed
the mine right.

35:40.849 --> 35:45.479
- Komah ata, Heru-ur.
- Onak lo hassa, chel Apophis.

35:47.523 --> 35:49.650
Send the shol'va to Lord Apophis.

35:54.905 --> 35:57.282
Apophis has agreed to the alliance.

35:57.407 --> 36:02.371
Dad, Teal'c risked his life to save all of us
when he came to rescue you on Netu.

36:02.496 --> 36:04.540
You owe him. We all do.

36:04.665 --> 36:08.085
How is Heru-ur gonna transport
Teal'c to Apophis' ship?

36:08.210 --> 36:10.504
He would probably use rings.

36:10.629 --> 36:15.092
We can save Teal'c the way that he saved
us, by intercepting the matter stream.

36:15.217 --> 36:19.304
- It won't work while the ship is in stealth.
- So uncloak it.

36:19.388 --> 36:22.349
It would take some pretty fancy flying.

36:25.561 --> 36:27.604
It's your ship.

36:53.714 --> 36:57.050
I've never seen anyone
endure such torture,...

36:57.134 --> 37:00.304
..and yet none of it comes close
to what Apophis will do to you.

37:00.387 --> 37:02.514
He will kill you a thousand times.

37:03.223 --> 37:05.267
Of that I am certain.

37:05.392 --> 37:07.936
And you will never admit that he is a god?

37:11.648 --> 37:13.609
Never.

37:13.734 --> 37:16.820
You are either insane or...

37:16.945 --> 37:19.323
Take him down!

37:19.448 --> 37:22.326
The shol'va is to be
transported to Apophis.

37:38.133 --> 37:40.802
What do you think
you are doing? Shol'va!

37:51.271 --> 37:53.732
My Lord, you are killing him.

37:53.857 --> 37:58.570
I will not be denied the satisfaction
of watching him die at least once.

38:05.369 --> 38:07.412
My Lord.

38:55.002 --> 38:57.129
- What happened?
- We missed him.

38:57.212 --> 38:59.756
- So what now?
- We better get out of here.

39:00.424 --> 39:03.594
A cargo ship attempted
to intercept the matter stream.

39:03.677 --> 39:04.845
What?

39:15.397 --> 39:20.861
It looks like you programmed the mine
right. It's going for Apophis's ship.

39:28.785 --> 39:30.329
What is this?

39:30.412 --> 39:33.665
Heru-ur transported him
instead of the shol'va.

39:39.796 --> 39:42.174
Heru-ur attacks.

39:45.302 --> 39:48.222
- You dare to attack me?
- It is deception.

39:48.680 --> 39:51.517
The deception is yours.
Where is the shol'va?

39:56.980 --> 39:59.191
- We gotta go back for Teal'c.
- And do what?

39:59.274 --> 40:01.485
- Something.
- It's too late.

40:25.008 --> 40:27.636
- That's not possible.
- Apparently, it is.

40:27.970 --> 40:32.516
The Goa'uld were never able to cloak an
entire mother ship, let alone a fleet.

40:32.975 --> 40:35.018
Kree Heru-ur!

40:35.894 --> 40:39.231
Sheh pak arak Apophis.

41:06.133 --> 41:10.679
- They're protecting Apophis's ship.
- They're allowing him to escape.

41:11.889 --> 41:16.185
We're picking up a glider that seems
to have escaped from Heru-ur's ship.

41:16.685 --> 41:19.646
- Heru-ur himself?
- We can't let him get away.

41:20.814 --> 41:23.901
Onak sha kree, chel Goa'uld.

41:24.026 --> 41:26.487
(Rak'nor) Goach sha kree, lo Goa'uld.

41:29.114 --> 41:33.660
I asked him which god he worshipped,
and he answered with a Tok'ra password.

41:33.744 --> 41:37.498
This is Jacob Carter. Identify yourself.

41:38.999 --> 41:41.043
My name is Rak'nor.

41:41.126 --> 41:44.463
Who are you? How did you know
how to answer my hail?

41:45.214 --> 41:47.758
I am the Jaffa who helped Teal'c escape.

41:50.052 --> 41:52.095
How do we know that?

41:58.018 --> 42:00.479
It is good to hear your voice, O'Neill.

42:07.194 --> 42:11.657
- Glad you made it, Teal'c.
- As am l.

42:11.782 --> 42:14.451
We can rendezvous on
the third moon ofTichenor.

42:14.535 --> 42:16.578
We'll meet you there.

42:24.878 --> 42:27.756
Well, I guess we've stopped the alliance.

42:27.840 --> 42:31.844
(as Selmak) Unfortunately,
it is the worst possible result.

42:31.927 --> 42:34.388
- No war.
- No.

42:34.513 --> 42:38.642
We did not know that Apophis would
bring a cloaked fleet into the minefield.

42:38.725 --> 42:39.810
So what now?

42:39.935 --> 42:44.481
Apophis will easily absorb
Heru-ur's forces into his own.

42:44.606 --> 42:47.317
He is now a bigger threat
than ever before.
