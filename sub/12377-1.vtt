00:36.653 --> 00:38.587
Okay. I can't get that, that...

00:38.755 --> 00:40.450
Okay, guys. Ready?

00:40.657 --> 00:43.097
- We wish you a Merry Christmas.
- It's just the...

00:43.260 --> 00:44.625
bike I wanted.

00:44.862 --> 00:46.022
Yeah, do you like it?

00:47.297 --> 00:48.355
Is that the one?

00:48.599 --> 00:50.499
Good. Merry Christmas.

00:50.701 --> 00:52.191
Oh, the new hockey stick.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.737
Is it a good size?

00:54.905 --> 00:55.929
Yeah, it looks fine to me.

00:56.106 --> 00:57.403
Let me see that slapshot.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.531
Hey, don't knock anything off the table.

01:02.913 --> 01:04.141
I am the greatest.

01:04.681 --> 01:05.875
I am the greatest.

01:09.019 --> 01:11.453
Show me what you got. Oh.

01:12.522 --> 01:13.853
Hang on one sec.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.093
Ready?

01:20.030 --> 01:21.520
All right, flip it up.

01:24.735 --> 01:25.827
You okay?

01:29.506 --> 01:30.632
You okay?

01:31.942 --> 01:33.466
Okay, you're on your own.

01:33.644 --> 01:36.044
Oh, my gosh. Luke.

01:36.747 --> 01:38.305
Oh, honey.

01:39.216 --> 01:40.012
Watch out for the tree though.

01:40.183 --> 01:40.740
Do a trick.

01:40.918 --> 01:42.146
Do a trick.

01:43.420 --> 01:44.580
How proud are you of him?

01:44.755 --> 01:46.017
Oh, my God. He's amazing.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.383
Did mommy do that?

01:47.557 --> 01:49.457
Tell me the truth.
Did mommy do that painting for you?

01:49.626 --> 01:52.686
Hey. Wow. Look at that.

01:52.863 --> 01:55.195
Just got one question.
What the heck is it?

01:55.499 --> 01:57.194
It is abstract.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.426
So when I get signed,
I'll buy you a new house, okay?

01:59.603 --> 02:00.934
Hey, what's wrong with this house?

02:01.672 --> 02:02.570
Ready?

02:06.143 --> 02:07.235
Oh, shit.

02:07.411 --> 02:09.072
Okay, make a wish.

02:09.812 --> 02:11.075
So how old are you, mom?

02:11.782 --> 02:13.147
- How old am I?
- We were just wondering.

02:13.317 --> 02:14.341
You look gorgeous.

02:14.584 --> 02:16.814
You don't look a day over...

02:18.655 --> 02:20.122
Just spit it out, dad.

02:21.792 --> 02:23.851
Brendan Hume, you've just won MVP.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.216
...our golden boy.

02:27.764 --> 02:30.096
Number one...

02:30.667 --> 02:31.634
Get this baby lit.

02:31.935 --> 02:33.027
Can I slap him when we wake him up?

02:33.203 --> 02:34.363
No...

02:34.538 --> 02:34.799
Please?

02:34.972 --> 02:36.371
He's going to kill us.

02:37.474 --> 02:38.498
Surprise!

02:38.675 --> 02:40.108
- Surprise!
- Happy Birthday, Lukey!

02:40.277 --> 02:42.108
- Happy Birthday, Lukey!
- Happy Birthday.

02:42.746 --> 02:43.178
Fourteen,

02:43.347 --> 02:46.316
it feels no different that yesterday
when I was thirteen.

02:46.483 --> 02:48.678
Do you want your
fourteen punches now or...?

02:49.086 --> 02:50.815
A little later, after I wake up.

02:51.555 --> 02:52.613
Get off me.

02:52.990 --> 02:55.015
Ah man. I almost had you.

02:55.192 --> 02:59.993
Should old acquaintance be forgot.

03:00.163 --> 03:05.294
And never brought to mind.

03:05.535 --> 03:10.598
Should old acquaintance be forgot.

03:10.774 --> 03:15.143
And days of auld lang syne.

03:37.501 --> 03:38.195
Can I bother you?

03:38.368 --> 03:43.067
Just you think there's no order anywhere,
there's order looking right at you.

03:43.507 --> 03:44.565
Okay.

03:44.808 --> 03:45.274
What do you need here?

03:45.442 --> 03:46.932
Annie just said I need you to approve this.

03:47.110 --> 03:48.737
This guy worked here
at Starfish for six years...

03:48.912 --> 03:51.312
but his wife's dead, no kids, no will.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.108
I just want to roll his pension
back up into the fund,

03:53.283 --> 03:54.272
make it easy.

03:58.021 --> 03:59.283
Come on, don't make file with the state.

03:59.456 --> 04:00.980
We file with the state so that one day...

04:01.158 --> 04:04.525
if someone looks back at this guy's death,
he will see that we did our job.

04:04.694 --> 04:06.093
You're right.
You've got to cover our asses.

04:06.263 --> 04:06.695
I got it, sorry.

04:06.863 --> 04:08.330
No... we do our job,

04:08.498 --> 04:10.728
and we do right by a guy who worked for us.

04:10.901 --> 04:12.300
Lest he died in vain.

04:13.703 --> 04:14.965
What's that 'order in the universe' thing?

04:15.138 --> 04:19.973
Well, you know, our insurer spent
three hundred thousand bucks...

04:20.142 --> 04:22.111
on this new model, new field data,

04:22.279 --> 04:23.268
new society.

04:23.447 --> 04:25.108
Who is the ideal employee?

04:25.282 --> 04:27.045
Who dies how and when?

04:27.717 --> 04:29.810
And they sent it over to show
what a great job they're doing.

04:29.986 --> 04:31.146
And you know what it says?

04:31.521 --> 04:35.252
It says that people with kids live longer
than people with no kids...

04:35.425 --> 04:37.450
people with two live longer
than people with one...

04:37.627 --> 04:38.719
smoking is bad...

04:38.895 --> 04:39.987
speeding is bad...

04:40.163 --> 04:43.064
deaths in a family are bad...
divorce is bad.

04:44.935 --> 04:45.731
It's kind of nice...

04:45.902 --> 04:49.133
to see that all that junk is still true.

04:49.840 --> 04:50.636
You know?

04:50.807 --> 04:52.172
Hey, you're the one with perfect kids.

04:53.343 --> 04:55.004
Brendan, you're such a kiss-ass.

04:56.813 --> 04:57.802
God gave me the skills.

04:57.981 --> 04:58.970
- I can't help it.
- Oh. God. Mom.

04:59.416 --> 05:00.610
I need to go kill myself.

05:00.851 --> 05:01.510
Of course you do, Lukey.

05:01.685 --> 05:02.447
May I be excused?

05:02.619 --> 05:03.278
No.

05:03.987 --> 05:05.079
I've got a cretin for a brother.

05:05.255 --> 05:06.620
I've a no-dick for a brother.

05:06.790 --> 05:09.020
Okay, you stop. Right now.

05:09.593 --> 05:10.753
You should know better.

05:10.927 --> 05:11.757
What?

05:14.064 --> 05:16.498
Let's be a family, should we?

05:16.666 --> 05:17.394
Can I say no?

05:17.567 --> 05:18.295
No.

05:18.935 --> 05:21.267
I demand emancipation. I want a lawyer.

05:21.438 --> 05:22.598
Okay, I am filing right...

05:23.006 --> 05:24.166
- I'm home.
- Now.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.064
Sorry I'm late. Did I miss dinner?

05:26.243 --> 05:28.905
No, there's plenty.
I'll heat something up for you.

05:29.846 --> 05:31.575
Hey, dad,
I need a ride to the city on Saturday.

05:32.549 --> 05:33.277
The city?

05:33.450 --> 05:34.849
Yeah, it's an exchange game.

05:35.318 --> 05:37.013
I'm the first line again.

05:37.187 --> 05:38.176
No kidding.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.120
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah.

05:40.357 --> 05:41.517
Waldren must love you.

05:41.725 --> 05:43.625
Yeah, because he's a kiss-ass.

05:43.793 --> 05:45.658
Well, good for him. We all going?

05:45.829 --> 05:47.524
No, Lukey's got soccer.

05:47.831 --> 05:49.298
Yeah, but I'm not starting

05:49.466 --> 05:50.694
so you can just go on...
- Maybe you should just kiss some...

05:50.867 --> 05:53.961
more ass, or just not suck so bad.

05:55.705 --> 05:58.697
Dad, he was just kidding.
Okay, he was just being an idiot.

05:58.875 --> 05:59.603
Don't call him an idiot.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.971
Lucas, you have a loyal and loving brother.

06:02.179 --> 06:02.873
I agree.

06:03.046 --> 06:04.980
A loyal and loving kiss-ass.

06:05.148 --> 06:08.276
Look, should we just all please
be civilized for once

06:08.451 --> 06:09.543
before I kill somebody?

06:09.986 --> 06:11.010
Whatever, weasel.

06:11.421 --> 06:12.888
Duh, whatever, weasel.

06:14.057 --> 06:15.149
Luke.

06:15.825 --> 06:16.849
Plate.

06:24.167 --> 06:25.532
Come here, little punk.

06:26.036 --> 06:27.196
Get off me.

06:27.504 --> 06:29.301
See what you miss
when you don't come home.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.064
Yeah, well, at least
they're not throwing food.

06:46.590 --> 06:48.615
Play a heck of a game, kid.
I'm proud of you.

06:49.025 --> 06:49.821
Heck of a game.

06:50.060 --> 06:50.583
Thank you...

06:50.760 --> 06:52.250
Love the way you're handling the puck.

06:52.629 --> 06:53.653
It's great.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.732
So some of the guys have been talking about

06:58.301 --> 06:59.791
maybe going to college in Canada.

07:00.437 --> 07:01.267
Canada, huh?

07:01.938 --> 07:03.371
Canada is far.

07:03.807 --> 07:04.637
You'll still have Lukey.

07:04.808 --> 07:06.036
Now there's a comfort.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.909
Oh, no, come on, I'm kidding.

07:09.079 --> 07:10.774
You get to kid about your kids
or you lose your mind.

07:10.947 --> 07:11.879
You'll see.

07:12.048 --> 07:13.242
Look, you had a great game.

07:13.416 --> 07:14.849
You've had several great games...

07:15.018 --> 07:18.920
but professional hockey, is that
what we're talking about here, Bren?

07:19.089 --> 07:20.386
I mean maybe, I don't know.

07:20.557 --> 07:23.025
That's a risky business.

07:23.193 --> 07:26.924
And this is coming from your
extensive professional sports background

07:27.097 --> 07:28.564
- or...
- No, my extensive...

07:28.732 --> 07:31.257
risk assessment background,
thank you very much.

07:31.434 --> 07:33.664
Risk, liabilities, the stuff of life, son.

07:33.837 --> 07:36.032
No, it's the stuff of your life, dad,

07:36.206 --> 07:37.867
your thrilling life.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.941
Hey, don't make fun of your father,
you bum.

07:40.143 --> 07:41.474
I'm the only one you get.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.089
I guess we can talk to Coach Waldren...

07:56.259 --> 07:59.057
and you can research schools in Canada...

07:59.229 --> 08:01.823
and find somebody who
could educate us on hockey

08:01.998 --> 08:03.863
- versus law school.
- Dad...

08:04.034 --> 08:04.466
What?

08:04.634 --> 08:05.566
Educate us?

08:06.269 --> 08:07.930
Look, I just want to play some hockey.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.904
Hey, lights.

08:20.283 --> 08:22.376
Dad, so what do you say?

08:22.552 --> 08:25.350
I said we could look into it,

08:25.755 --> 08:26.813
- all right? - Okay.

08:27.123 --> 08:28.147
Please don't tell your mother.

08:28.325 --> 08:29.451
I would never.

08:46.843 --> 08:48.743
Where the heck is the darn expressway?

08:50.980 --> 08:52.038
Oh, great.

09:14.671 --> 09:15.569
Hey, where do you think you're going?

09:15.739 --> 09:16.831
I need my fluids, dad.

09:17.006 --> 09:19.804
Oh, yeah, the obligatory Slushee stop.

09:19.976 --> 09:20.635
They have them in there, right?

09:20.810 --> 09:22.175
That, or something worse for you.

09:22.345 --> 09:23.369
- Do you have money?
- Yeah.

09:23.546 --> 09:25.309
Okay, quick in and out,
because we got to get home.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.471
All right.

09:35.291 --> 09:38.089
Hey, honey, it's me.
I just wanted to let you know...

09:38.261 --> 09:41.321
that our son is going to
Canada to play hockey...

09:41.631 --> 09:43.189
and we didn't want any kind of
long drawn-out goodbye,

09:43.366 --> 09:44.890
so I dropped him off at the airport.

09:45.068 --> 09:45.693
He says he'll call,

09:45.869 --> 09:49.305
but of course we may
never see our son again.

09:50.140 --> 09:51.505
But as long as he's happy, right?

09:52.208 --> 09:52.936
Okay.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.438
I love you.

09:54.611 --> 09:56.602
And we'll be home soon. Bye.

09:58.314 --> 09:59.212
Watch your ass, bitch.

09:59.549 --> 10:04.851
Back up off me, all right. Whatever, man.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.136
Get the fuck down

10:22.305 --> 10:24.239
or I will blow your fucking head off.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.769
Get the fuck down.

10:26.643 --> 10:28.440
Hey, yo, this is your man.

10:28.678 --> 10:29.474
This is your man.

10:29.646 --> 10:30.874
- He's going for his gat, dog.
- Come on, Billy.

10:41.324 --> 10:42.291
Get this fucker.

10:43.092 --> 10:43.888
That's your guy.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.722
Do this or you're not one of us. Do it.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.156
Hey, you can do this.

10:51.434 --> 10:51.957
Joey.

10:52.135 --> 10:53.602
Kill that motherfucker, Joey.

10:58.475 --> 10:59.442
That's my boy.

11:00.143 --> 11:01.576
Let's go. Let's go.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.711
Give me the gun. Let's go.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.779
- What about Joey.
- Get the fuck in the car.

11:07.784 --> 11:08.682
What the fuck!

11:21.331 --> 11:22.093
Goddamn it.

11:33.977 --> 11:35.103
Fuck you.

11:35.678 --> 11:37.145
Motherfucker.

11:41.551 --> 11:42.449
Brendan.

11:42.919 --> 11:43.783
Brendan.

11:44.354 --> 11:46.185
Oh, God.

11:48.625 --> 11:49.717
Help.

11:50.159 --> 11:51.285
Help me.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.986
Somebody help me.

12:00.370 --> 12:02.565
Help.

12:13.883 --> 12:15.043
Where's Joe?

12:15.218 --> 12:16.310
He's a man now.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.211
He can take the subway.

12:26.763 --> 12:27.627
Can you get some help?

12:27.897 --> 12:29.421
Can somebody help us, please? Please.

12:29.599 --> 12:30.156
Doctor.

12:30.266 --> 12:31.665
I need a gurney.

12:31.768 --> 12:33.929
He was cut. Somebody cut him in...

12:34.237 --> 12:36.728
Get an airway open. Create an airway.

12:36.873 --> 12:37.464
He's my son.

12:37.640 --> 12:38.470
- That's my son.
- Maggie.

12:38.641 --> 12:39.835
- Okay, get him.
- Brendan,

12:40.076 --> 12:41.737
we're in the hospital now, okay?

12:42.979 --> 12:44.276
They're going to take care of you now.

12:44.814 --> 12:46.304
Get your fixed up.

12:46.382 --> 12:47.440
Sir, I'm sorry.

12:47.617 --> 12:48.345
You need to stay back here.
- What?

12:48.518 --> 12:51.043
- No, the doctors need to do their job, sir.
- I know,

12:51.220 --> 12:52.710
but I can't go in there?

12:53.356 --> 12:54.323
Sorry.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.223
Okay, he'll be okay, right?

12:58.361 --> 13:00.693
It's my son.

13:02.599 --> 13:04.260
His name's Brendan.

13:55.351 --> 13:56.340
Five

13:57.654 --> 13:58.746
It's number five.

14:01.324 --> 14:02.552
That's Joe Darley.

14:02.959 --> 14:03.926
He's...

14:05.728 --> 14:06.786
a kid.

14:07.630 --> 14:10.190
He's a runt. Almost twenty-three.

14:11.901 --> 14:13.095
And he's an animal.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.435
Supposed to have some kind of a...

14:47.737 --> 14:49.705
pre-trial, a hearing, tomorrow...

14:50.973 --> 14:52.964
and they want me to go make a statement.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.042
You want to go with me?

15:03.319 --> 15:04.513
You go.

15:07.557 --> 15:10.492
Put that animal in jail.

15:14.363 --> 15:15.796
That's what the cops called him.

15:17.233 --> 15:18.393
Animal.

15:19.635 --> 15:21.125
You're going to take that off?

15:46.429 --> 15:49.125
The school said
they wanted to do a memorial

15:50.099 --> 15:51.589
at the next game.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.303
The team wanted to do something.

15:57.807 --> 15:59.104
That's nice of them.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.384
He would have been playing.

16:21.197 --> 16:25.065
Till my body is dust.

16:26.135 --> 16:30.868
Till my soul is no more.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.403
I will love you.

16:34.944 --> 16:38.971
Love you.

16:41.417 --> 16:46.616
Till the sun starts to cry.

16:47.190 --> 16:51.524
And the moon turns to rust.

16:51.861 --> 16:54.989
I will love you...

16:55.398 --> 16:59.300
love you.

17:01.237 --> 17:05.640
But I need to know...

17:06.409 --> 17:16.114
Will you stay for all time forever...

17:16.285 --> 17:20.415
and a day?

17:20.623 --> 17:25.060
Then I'll give my heart...

17:25.228 --> 17:32.930
till the end of our time...

17:34.237 --> 17:38.799
forever and a day.

17:38.975 --> 17:39.566
Today's easy.

17:39.742 --> 17:42.074
I need you to sit there,
put the fear of God in this guy.

17:42.245 --> 17:44.076
If the judge asks you,
you tell him what you told us,

17:44.247 --> 17:45.612
and identify Darley in court.

17:46.115 --> 17:47.047
Okay?

17:47.950 --> 17:49.850
The minute I get your statement in,
with you sitting right there...

17:50.019 --> 17:51.884
the public defender's going to
wet his pants and fold.

17:52.054 --> 17:53.146
I'll make a deal in five minutes.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.313
Get this guy in jail today, easy-peasy.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.549
Deal? Wait.

17:57.126 --> 17:58.354
Hang on, what do you mean?

17:58.828 --> 17:59.317
What deal?

17:59.495 --> 18:01.156
I want this guy to go away
for the rest of his life.

18:01.330 --> 18:01.694
No.

18:01.864 --> 18:05.061
I can get you 3 to 5, guaranteed.
That's a very decent result.

18:05.434 --> 18:06.696
I'm talking guaranteed time,

18:06.869 --> 18:08.734
not maybe, not the jury
didn't feel up to it.

18:08.905 --> 18:10.930
That's worth more than chasing some
make-believe 10 to life

18:11.107 --> 18:11.801
and the guy walks free.

18:11.974 --> 18:12.872
You want that?

18:13.109 --> 18:14.406
He killed my son.

18:14.810 --> 18:16.710
Mr. Hume. I've got one eyewitness. You.

18:16.879 --> 18:17.470
That's nice.

18:17.647 --> 18:19.410
But do you know how many cases
with one eyewitness

18:19.582 --> 18:21.072
I don't even bother to try for a deal on?

18:21.250 --> 18:23.081
The machete magically disappeared.

18:23.252 --> 18:25.083
The only blood we could
find on that weasel was his own

18:25.254 --> 18:26.278
from when the car clipped him.

18:26.455 --> 18:28.116
And you picked
the only gas station in America

18:28.291 --> 18:30.088
without a working surveillance camera.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.259
We've just got your word.

18:32.428 --> 18:35.022
That's not bad,
if I can scare the guy into a deal.

18:35.197 --> 18:38.530
You're using my son's death
like some kind of card trick.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.966
Look, I get a banger off the street
a year or so,

18:42.138 --> 18:43.628
somebody does my job for me...

18:43.806 --> 18:46.036
he doesn't get out of there alive.
Fine with me.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.301
He finds Jesus. Fine with me.

18:48.477 --> 18:50.377
But we get religion and go to trail,

18:50.546 --> 18:51.843
as much as I'd love to...

18:52.014 --> 18:53.413
and the defense starts working on.

18:53.582 --> 18:55.243
"When was your last eye exam?"

18:55.418 --> 18:56.976
"What do you have
against inner city youth?"

18:57.153 --> 18:59.280
And how unfair it is for them
to grow up so violent...

18:59.455 --> 19:02.583
how they're forced into initiation killings
or face execution themselves.

19:02.758 --> 19:05.249
You want a jury feeling sorry
for this fucker? Huh?

19:05.428 --> 19:06.053
You want him to walk?

19:06.228 --> 19:07.160
Wait, you said...

19:07.663 --> 19:08.994
initiation killing.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.665
I thought this was a robbery.

19:12.368 --> 19:13.596
It only looked like one.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.063
It was an initiation.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.933
You kill someone at random
to get made in a gang.

19:19.608 --> 19:20.939
It's the price of admission.

19:23.279 --> 19:24.769
Are you saying that Brendan was killed...

19:24.947 --> 19:28.576
so that some asshole
could feel more like a man?

19:29.318 --> 19:32.116
So that he could be in some club?

19:39.962 --> 19:42.829
This is a 'take it or leave it' thing,
sorry to say.

19:46.569 --> 19:48.969
Your Honor, I'd like to enter
the statement of a witness...

19:49.138 --> 19:50.571
present at the time of the attack,

19:50.740 --> 19:51.900
father of the victim.

19:52.408 --> 19:55.673
We can enter that at trial,
can we not, Mr. Behring?

19:55.845 --> 19:57.335
I believe, your honor,
if we enter it today...

19:57.513 --> 19:59.708
defense will change their plea to guilty.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.110
Save the people the time
and expense of a trial.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.342
That's the statement?

20:10.860 --> 20:11.986
Mr. Hume?

20:14.130 --> 20:15.563
Mr. Hume?

20:17.099 --> 20:21.195
You're giving evidence that
Mr. Darley here, before your eyes...

20:21.370 --> 20:23.736
attacked your son and caused his death?

20:25.941 --> 20:29.877
You're saying you will testify to that
in a trial?

20:32.648 --> 20:34.377
No, your honor, I am not.

20:35.284 --> 20:36.148
What?

20:37.053 --> 20:38.884
It was dark.

20:39.622 --> 20:40.987
There were a lot of them.

20:42.091 --> 20:43.752
I can't be sure anymore.

20:44.693 --> 20:45.717
Mr. Behring...

20:45.895 --> 20:49.626
do you expect to obtain evidence
other than Mr. Hume's here?

20:49.799 --> 20:51.096
No, your honor, I do not.

20:52.601 --> 20:54.296
I'm dismissing this case.

20:54.470 --> 20:57.803
Mr. Darley, you're released from custody.

20:57.973 --> 21:01.966
You may return with a bailiff
to the holding cells...

21:02.144 --> 21:04.544
to retrieve your personal effects.

21:30.773 --> 21:31.364
Joe.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.303
You beat that shit. You beat that.

21:34.009 --> 21:35.135
You the man.

21:35.311 --> 21:36.278
That's it.

21:47.189 --> 21:47.951
Come on, let's go.

21:48.858 --> 21:52.316
You beat that rap pretty fucking good,
huh? I'm proud of you.

21:53.295 --> 21:54.489
Who's a man now?

21:54.930 --> 21:55.658
I know.

21:55.831 --> 21:56.820
Get in the car.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.159
Have a nice fun time
with this one here, weasel.

23:04.333 --> 23:06.164
- Okay. - All right?

23:09.505 --> 23:10.472
I'm proud of you.

23:11.073 --> 23:11.869
All right?

24:11.900 --> 24:12.832
Dad?

24:16.939 --> 24:17.837
Dad?

24:19.208 --> 24:20.266
What are you doing?

24:22.144 --> 24:23.076
Nothing.

24:33.956 --> 24:35.890
Hey, what are you doing?
Don't play with that. Put it down.

24:43.732 --> 24:47.361
So it was...

24:47.536 --> 24:49.197
like a...

24:49.838 --> 24:51.772
gas station.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.380
Where Bren got killed?

25:02.217 --> 25:04.208
Yeah, it was a gas station.

25:05.454 --> 25:06.648
Why do you want to know?

25:08.657 --> 25:09.715
I just...

25:11.460 --> 25:13.325
you know, I wondered where he died.

25:16.799 --> 25:17.788
Yeah.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.658
It was...

25:20.736 --> 25:22.431
a Stop-Spot in Rockside.

25:24.373 --> 25:25.567
Do you...

25:26.542 --> 25:28.908
Do you think he was scared?

25:34.216 --> 25:37.049
Yeah, Luke, I do.

25:38.020 --> 25:39.510
I think he was scared.

25:43.058 --> 25:44.082
How did it go?

25:44.426 --> 25:45.358
They let him go.

25:45.761 --> 25:47.319
They did what? Why?

25:48.163 --> 25:48.993
I don't think it was him.

25:49.164 --> 25:51.632
Well, but you said it was him.
You said they had him.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.228
Are they going to keep looking?

25:53.402 --> 25:54.767
Yeah, they said they would.

25:55.037 --> 25:56.265
Oh, Jesus.

25:56.438 --> 25:57.905
I'm sorry. What do you want me to do?

26:03.746 --> 26:04.735
I'm sorry.

26:05.314 --> 26:07.544
I left something at the office.
I'd better go back.

26:08.217 --> 26:09.184
Now?

26:09.385 --> 26:10.977
- Nick.
- I'll be home as soon as I can.

26:35.344 --> 26:36.902
Oh, God, what am I doing?

27:51.954 --> 27:53.421
Fucking piece of shit.

27:54.623 --> 27:55.612
Fuck.

27:57.326 --> 27:58.293
Jesus.

28:00.963 --> 28:03.397
Fuck man. You fucking scared the shi...

28:05.367 --> 28:06.527
Hey, wait a minute.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.236
You fucking kidding me?

28:12.908 --> 28:13.966
You?

28:42.304 --> 28:43.134
Fuck.

28:44.206 --> 28:45.104
Fuck.

28:50.312 --> 28:51.040
Fuck.

29:06.595 --> 29:09.029
Fuck.

29:11.733 --> 29:12.631
Oh, God.

29:31.720 --> 29:32.846
Oh, God.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.080
Oh, fuck.

30:44.893 --> 30:45.484
Oh, you know mom's perfect.

30:45.661 --> 30:46.685
Oh, well, that's for sure.

30:46.862 --> 30:47.760
Nah, I got nothing.

30:49.264 --> 30:50.891
I want to be just like you, dad.

30:51.233 --> 30:52.427
Oh, that's what I like to hear.

30:52.601 --> 30:54.569
I've been meaning to do this for months.

30:55.637 --> 30:57.434
It's very grown-up of you to help.

31:05.947 --> 31:07.039
Hi, guys.

31:07.315 --> 31:08.247
Hey.

31:09.451 --> 31:10.611
What happened?

31:11.119 --> 31:13.349
I slipped in the driveway.

31:13.522 --> 31:15.615
Honey. Oh, my God. Look at you.

31:16.091 --> 31:16.489
You're a mess.

31:16.658 --> 31:18.319
It's okay, I cut my head. That's all.

31:18.493 --> 31:19.152
Are you all right?

31:19.327 --> 31:20.692
Fine, yeah. That's okay.

31:20.862 --> 31:21.988
No, it's not okay.

31:22.164 --> 31:23.256
I'm going to take a shower.

31:23.432 --> 31:25.798
Okay, I'm going to get bandages.
I'll bring them up.

31:30.772 --> 31:31.864
How you doing, kid?

31:32.307 --> 31:33.137
You okay?

31:34.409 --> 31:35.637
I'm okay.

31:36.411 --> 31:36.843
I guess.

31:39.948 --> 31:41.176
Good.

31:42.517 --> 31:43.779
That's good.

31:47.422 --> 31:49.049
I'm going to take a shower.

31:53.462 --> 31:55.487
Brendan Hume, you've just won MVP.

31:56.031 --> 31:56.759
What do you have to say for yourself?

31:56.932 --> 31:58.524
Can I take this already? Can I take this?

31:58.934 --> 32:01.198
Number one...

32:03.238 --> 32:05.331
Brendan Hume, our golden boy.

32:38.507 --> 32:39.565
Oh, honey.

32:40.942 --> 32:41.966
Oh, God.

32:42.144 --> 32:43.839
- Oh, God.
- Baby. It's okay.

32:44.546 --> 32:45.843
I'm so sorry.

32:46.281 --> 32:48.215
- Oh, God.
- It's okay.

32:48.683 --> 32:50.742
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

32:52.087 --> 32:53.076
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

33:39.401 --> 33:40.333
Yo, Billy.

33:52.647 --> 33:55.514
Watch the fucking pieces.

33:56.585 --> 33:58.450
For Chris' sake, they're worth something,

33:58.620 --> 33:59.780
unlike you.

34:00.522 --> 34:01.853
Where you been, Nancy?

34:06.027 --> 34:07.221
What the fuck you call that?

34:07.963 --> 34:09.123
That's our night.

34:10.065 --> 34:13.034
When I take pity on you
and your faggot half-wit friends...

34:13.201 --> 34:14.929
give you a couple of corners to run...

34:15.503 --> 34:17.130
you better deliver for me...

34:17.438 --> 34:20.431
or I'll know you been dealing,
and I'll kill you.

34:20.876 --> 34:22.571
You could be the prince of Pan-Yan...

34:23.678 --> 34:24.975
if you fucking light-bag me,

34:25.647 --> 34:27.274
I'll fucking kill you.

34:28.183 --> 34:29.741
Lord knows I've been patient.

34:35.757 --> 34:36.553
Yes.

34:37.993 --> 34:40.154
You can get the fuck out of my sight now.

34:49.804 --> 34:51.203
Fucking half-wit.

35:05.220 --> 35:06.118
What?

35:08.189 --> 35:09.213
What?

35:10.392 --> 35:13.088
Somebody fucking tell me
what the fuck is going on.

35:19.067 --> 35:20.125
You hear?

35:22.704 --> 35:23.796
Joe, dude.

35:25.907 --> 35:27.238
Somebody stuck him.

35:29.544 --> 35:30.704
He's dead.

35:33.415 --> 35:34.382
What?

35:37.319 --> 35:38.445
You're lying.

35:40.288 --> 35:41.482
Man he's gone.

35:57.405 --> 35:58.269
Hey.

36:00.842 --> 36:03.936
How you guys faring?
You getting through?

36:04.813 --> 36:06.280
Yeah, we're okay.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.246
You find compensations.

36:09.651 --> 36:11.414
That's what we do, right?
We compensate for our losses.

36:11.586 --> 36:12.575
Move on.

36:13.788 --> 36:15.653
If anything like that
ever happened to me, I'd just...

36:16.524 --> 36:18.014
I don't know, I think I'd snap.

36:18.393 --> 36:21.760
Well, you really don't know
what you'd do until it happens.

36:22.864 --> 36:23.626
Surprise yourself.

36:23.798 --> 36:24.958
Excuse me, Nick.

36:25.367 --> 36:26.857
Detective Wallis is here to see you.

36:27.635 --> 36:29.034
Yeah, come on in.

36:30.005 --> 36:32.200
Hi, I'm sorry to break in on your day.

36:32.374 --> 36:33.432
No, it's fine.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.103
The guy we thought killed your son?

36:37.679 --> 36:38.839
Somebody killed him.

36:44.052 --> 36:45.019
Well, what was that?

36:45.186 --> 36:46.949
Some kind of a gang thing or...?

36:47.255 --> 36:47.949
We think so.

36:48.123 --> 36:50.023
Man, I guess there is justice, huh?

36:51.960 --> 36:53.291
Yeah, I suppose there is.

36:53.461 --> 36:54.485
I thought you'd like to know.

36:54.863 --> 36:56.854
If he was the guy, I mean.

37:00.402 --> 37:03.667
Yes, well, thanks for letting me know.

37:05.840 --> 37:08.070
All right, I'll leave you to it then.

37:12.847 --> 37:14.246
I guess I don't need to say anything,
Nick...

37:14.416 --> 37:17.283
but you know the company would pay
for counseling if you guys want it.

37:17.452 --> 37:18.578
We'll manage.

37:19.721 --> 37:20.619
Thanks, Owen.

37:20.922 --> 37:21.854
Okay.

37:26.895 --> 37:29.591
He didn't deserve that.
No way he deserved that.

37:30.065 --> 37:31.726
He was a true fucking soldier.

37:33.168 --> 37:34.100
To Joe.

37:35.203 --> 37:36.636
He was a good fucking boy.

37:37.772 --> 37:39.637
A good fucking boy.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.009
So that's what we're going to do?

37:45.947 --> 37:48.381
Why don't you show
a little fucking respect at least?

37:48.550 --> 37:50.745
See, that's why you guys are nothing.

37:50.919 --> 37:52.784
That's why you're bunch of fucking punks...

37:52.954 --> 37:54.251
because you would rather drink up

37:54.422 --> 37:56.617
and toke yourself fucking witless.

37:56.891 --> 37:58.722
Witless and scared shitless.

38:01.396 --> 38:02.260
My bad.

38:02.730 --> 38:03.890
Let's... here, cheers.

38:06.401 --> 38:08.266
Get your fucking glasses up.

38:08.436 --> 38:09.494
All of you.

38:23.518 --> 38:25.509
Joe just wasn't made for this shit.
That's all.

38:27.155 --> 38:28.213
He wasn't like us.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.050
No, wasn't like you, you mean.

38:30.225 --> 38:31.317
He was not like you.

38:31.493 --> 38:32.824
He was better than you.

38:34.629 --> 38:36.529
We as good as brothers
since we was kids,

38:36.698 --> 38:38.529
and you fucking go this way?

38:38.833 --> 38:40.391
What. I am not as good as you now?

38:40.635 --> 38:42.830
Joe was like blood to me, dog.

38:43.304 --> 38:45.238
As good as fucking blood. You, too.

38:59.087 --> 38:59.917
Well.

39:03.191 --> 39:05.751
I would like to catch the motherfucker
that did this.

39:05.927 --> 39:06.552
Oh, we will.

39:06.995 --> 39:07.927
Ain't no motherfucking doubt.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.996
Do the right fucking thing for Joe, yeah?

39:12.300 --> 39:13.767
So who fucking did it?

39:13.935 --> 39:16.403
It wasn't the Cutty Macks, man.
I would know about it.

39:16.838 --> 39:17.770
Unless you were high.

39:17.939 --> 39:18.997
I'm not high.

39:20.341 --> 39:21.569
Well, it wasn't B-street, Billy.

39:21.743 --> 39:23.938
Wasn't the Hall.
Wasn't any of those assholes.

39:24.112 --> 39:27.570
Yo, my sister said she saw some fucker
in a suit down there.

39:28.049 --> 39:29.243
Just chilling.

39:33.888 --> 39:37.051
How many 'fuckers in a suit'
you ever see at Stokely fucking Hall?

39:39.227 --> 39:40.626
See, here's a comical thing.

39:41.963 --> 39:44.557
When one of us gets killed,
we don't make the paper.

39:44.933 --> 39:50.200
But the son of a senior VP
of Starfish Capital...

39:58.112 --> 39:59.579
Go talk to your sister.

40:27.108 --> 40:28.405
Hey, Amy, what's up?

40:29.978 --> 40:30.842
I'm going home.

40:32.113 --> 40:34.274
You okay? You need anything?

40:35.216 --> 40:36.205
No, I'm fine.

40:36.484 --> 40:39.180
I'm just going to finish
this risk analysis and then...

40:40.054 --> 40:42.955
Actually,
could you drop this off with Owen, please

40:43.124 --> 40:44.182
on your way out?

40:44.425 --> 40:45.915
- Sure.
- Thank you. Good night.

42:10.945 --> 42:11.843
Wait, dude.

42:30.365 --> 42:31.798
Get his ass. Come on.

42:32.700 --> 42:33.291
Come on.

42:33.468 --> 42:34.492
Get him...

42:47.348 --> 42:48.508
Where's he at?

42:50.118 --> 42:51.244
Go...

42:56.557 --> 42:58.991
Go...

43:05.333 --> 43:07.062
Go...

43:12.206 --> 43:13.366
Go...

43:33.327 --> 43:34.316
Come on.

43:50.978 --> 43:52.775
Hey, which way is 1801?

43:54.916 --> 43:56.440
1801 Main, which way?

43:56.617 --> 43:57.777
Through the boiler room, there.

44:05.493 --> 44:06.960
Where the fuck did he go?

44:07.895 --> 44:10.363
Heco, Dog, Spink, go cut him off.

44:10.531 --> 44:11.520
Kill him.

44:27.949 --> 44:28.779
Go.

44:29.116 --> 44:30.048
Go.

44:37.225 --> 44:37.987
Go.

44:39.994 --> 44:40.790
Go.

44:44.932 --> 44:45.728
Where is he at?

44:51.973 --> 44:53.270
Oh, God. Okay.

44:57.211 --> 44:58.200
Oh, shit.

45:58.639 --> 45:59.697
Did you talk to Sally?

46:00.141 --> 46:00.937
Yeah.

46:01.008 --> 46:03.738
Move your ass, let's go.

46:06.581 --> 46:07.639
Tommy, go.

46:09.917 --> 46:12.408
Jamie, get your Willie Nelson ass up there.

46:13.020 --> 46:14.851
You ain't going to make
a fool out of me, motherfucker.

48:52.012 --> 48:52.979
Fuck.

50:53.901 --> 50:55.459
Billy, we got to go, man.

50:55.736 --> 50:56.760
Billy, we got to get the fuck out of here.
Come on.

50:56.937 --> 50:58.302
Go. Come on.

51:17.024 --> 51:19.959
Oh, fuck. Oh, Jesus.

51:43.384 --> 51:45.045
Hi honey, I'm sorry I'm late.

51:45.886 --> 51:46.682
What?

51:47.288 --> 51:48.255
Wait, what do you mean?
You can't find him?

51:48.422 --> 51:49.480
Where the hell is he?

51:50.424 --> 51:51.857
Well, did you call his friends?

51:53.928 --> 51:55.486
Oh, Jesus. Honey.

51:56.463 --> 51:57.862
Look, I got to call you back.

51:59.033 --> 52:00.432
I think I know where he is.

52:15.482 --> 52:16.244
All right.

52:16.617 --> 52:19.780
Get whatever prints you
can from this stuff. Let me know.

52:20.187 --> 52:21.916
Look, I need you to start a canvas,
all right?

52:22.089 --> 52:23.750
Pull people from the street if you have to.

52:23.924 --> 52:25.323
Someone had to see something.

52:46.613 --> 52:47.170
Luke.

52:47.481 --> 52:48.971
Luke, what the hell are you doing?

52:49.950 --> 52:52.043
Your mother's worried sick.
Now get in the car.

52:52.686 --> 52:52.981
No.

52:53.153 --> 52:54.518
I said, get in the car.

52:54.688 --> 52:56.519
No, I don't want to get in the car.

52:56.924 --> 52:57.822
I said get in the car.

53:00.894 --> 53:01.861
Fuck you.

53:02.029 --> 53:03.053
Lucas.

53:04.264 --> 53:05.231
This is not a safe place.

53:05.399 --> 53:07.299
Yeah, I know that much, don't I?

53:11.772 --> 53:13.569
Would it have been better if it was me?

53:14.908 --> 53:16.170
Is that what it is?

53:19.613 --> 53:21.046
You guys could
have handled that a lot easier

53:21.215 --> 53:23.080
than losing Bren the golden boy.

53:28.288 --> 53:29.255
Luke...

53:30.157 --> 53:31.590
Please get in the car.

53:34.328 --> 53:35.158
Come on.

53:36.864 --> 53:39.128
Luke, get in that goddamn car right now.

53:39.700 --> 53:40.962
Right now.

53:55.049 --> 53:56.311
Oh, God.

53:58.619 --> 54:00.746
Oh, baby. Honey.

54:00.921 --> 54:01.478
I'm sorry.

54:01.655 --> 54:03.714
Don't ever do that again, okay?

54:27.948 --> 54:30.382
Yo, we're going to do this?

55:07.354 --> 55:08.480
You need to sign in.

55:10.190 --> 55:11.748
Sir, you need to sign in.

55:11.925 --> 55:13.324
Messengers drop-off over there.

55:13.527 --> 55:15.017
No, I need to hand deliver this,

55:15.429 --> 55:16.589
to Nicholas Hume.

55:17.498 --> 55:19.762
You can sign in and
drop it off like everyone else.

55:24.805 --> 55:25.772
Call upstairs.

55:31.478 --> 55:32.172
Shit.

55:36.316 --> 55:37.578
Nicholas Hume.

55:40.687 --> 55:41.654
Move.

55:42.756 --> 55:44.189
Nicholas Hume.

55:47.661 --> 55:48.992
Nicholas Hume.

55:55.569 --> 55:57.036
Nice office, motherfucker.

55:59.540 --> 56:00.632
What the hell do you want?

56:02.976 --> 56:04.204
That's the gift of freedom, baby.

56:04.378 --> 56:06.209
Sir, should we escort this person out?

56:07.781 --> 56:08.475
Sir?

56:08.649 --> 56:10.708
Free from wondering
how you're going to die now.

56:11.385 --> 56:14.115
You're free from wondering
if you're going to die alone, you hear?

56:14.922 --> 56:15.980
Get him out of here.

56:16.356 --> 56:18.984
Because you'll get joy and grace all over

56:19.326 --> 56:21.157
when you finally meet your maker.

56:24.198 --> 56:25.165
Get off me!

57:53.320 --> 57:54.548
Where are you, you bastard?

57:56.189 --> 57:58.817
You want to send me a reward
for finding that wallet of yours?

57:58.992 --> 58:00.482
Tell me where the fuck you are, right now.

58:00.661 --> 58:02.788
No, I'll tell you where the fuck you are.

58:02.963 --> 58:04.828
You're in my end of the fucking sewer,
buddy.

58:04.998 --> 58:07.762
I say who lives. I say who dies.

58:08.101 --> 58:09.932
Now, you better get that through
your fucking skull,

58:10.103 --> 58:11.695
because there's no more warnings.

58:12.406 --> 58:14.374
I'm coming for some fucking family time.

58:14.541 --> 58:16.668
No. You listen to me.

58:18.178 --> 58:21.079
You go near my family...

58:21.748 --> 58:23.909
and I will cut out your goddamn guts

58:24.084 --> 58:26.450
like I did your fucking friend,
you hear me?

58:26.820 --> 58:28.048
He wasn't my friend.

58:29.890 --> 58:31.187
He was my brother.

58:32.926 --> 58:34.917
And now I'm coming for the rest
of your family.

58:35.896 --> 58:38.364
You just bought them
a death sentence, motherfucker.

58:38.532 --> 58:39.294
Wait.

58:39.633 --> 58:40.691
Don't.

58:41.635 --> 58:44.001
Fuck...

59:03.890 --> 59:04.584
Nick, what's going on?

59:04.758 --> 59:06.749
Pick up...

59:12.165 --> 59:12.460
Nick?

59:12.632 --> 59:13.690
Honey, are you okay?

59:13.967 --> 59:15.093
Is Luke home from school?

59:15.669 --> 59:16.727
Yes, we're fine.

59:16.903 --> 59:19.497
All right,
just stay there till the police come.

59:19.740 --> 59:20.172
Promise me.

59:20.340 --> 59:21.534
Why, what's wrong?

59:21.708 --> 59:24.541
Honey, just stay there
till the police get there.

59:24.911 --> 59:25.900
I'm on my way.

59:32.919 --> 59:33.908
Oh, come on...

59:34.087 --> 59:36.248
Hey, can I have Detective Wallis, please?

59:36.423 --> 59:37.390
Detective Wallis

59:37.557 --> 59:39.252
Give me Detective Wallis, right now.

59:41.027 --> 59:41.652
Shit.

59:41.828 --> 59:42.852
Homicide, this is Wallis.

59:43.029 --> 59:44.257
They threatened my family.

59:44.631 --> 59:45.461
Mr. Hume?

59:46.666 --> 59:47.724
Fucking trash...

59:48.235 --> 59:49.566
threatened to kill my family.

59:49.836 --> 59:51.770
All right, where is your family right now?

59:52.272 --> 59:52.931
They're at home.

59:53.106 --> 59:54.073
They're both at home.

59:54.975 --> 59:56.306
Just help us, please.

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.052
Helen? Luke?

01:00:15.629 --> 01:00:16.357
Nick?

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:20.560
God.

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:22.793
What the hell is happening?

01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:26.131
Honey, why the police...?

01:00:27.441 --> 01:00:28.635
Nick, you're scaring me.

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:30.540
Oh! God.

01:00:32.479 --> 01:00:33.468
Nick, talk to me.

01:00:33.647 --> 01:00:34.705
Dad, what's going on?

01:00:38.585 --> 01:00:39.483
Nick.

01:00:40.754 --> 01:00:41.880
What's going on?

01:00:44.691 --> 01:00:45.783
You stay there.

01:00:52.999 --> 01:00:54.057
Thank God you're here.

01:00:58.872 --> 01:01:00.499
Your son was a hockey player.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:02.006
Yes.

01:01:05.445 --> 01:01:06.844
The car will stay here tonight.

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:11.179
Now, Mr. Hume,
I think it's time you told me...

01:01:12.352 --> 01:01:14.411
exactly who did what to whom?

01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:18.988
You make war on the wrong dog, hm?

01:01:19.159 --> 01:01:20.319
That what you did?

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.221
Thought you could just go kill
some little asshole

01:01:22.395 --> 01:01:24.090
because you live all the way out here?

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:28.128
What are you saying?

01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:30.831
What is she saying, Nick?

01:01:31.004 --> 01:01:31.993
I've done nothing wrong.

01:01:32.172 --> 01:01:34.197
Well, then,
why don't you tell me how you make

01:01:34.374 --> 01:01:36.604
Billy Darley this pissed off at you?

01:01:40.814 --> 01:01:43.510
You asked for my help.

01:01:52.225 --> 01:01:53.419
All right.

01:01:54.394 --> 01:01:55.258
All right.

01:01:56.263 --> 01:01:59.596
Just try to get through tonight, Mr. Hume.

01:02:00.433 --> 01:02:03.596
And be grateful you're still alive.

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:06.829
But if you started a war...

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:10.067
God help you.

01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:16.309
What have you done?

01:02:26.793 --> 01:02:28.055
How do I make it stop?

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:30.523
Did you start it?

01:02:35.201 --> 01:02:36.168
Listen...

01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:38.761
I don't really care what happens to me.

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:42.498
I just need them to be safe.

01:02:43.276 --> 01:02:44.868
Tell me how to stop this?

01:02:48.281 --> 01:02:50.340
Well, first of all,
do everything they tell you.

01:02:51.217 --> 01:02:52.411
Everything.

01:02:53.386 --> 01:02:54.410
Don't worry, Mr. Hume.

01:02:54.588 --> 01:02:56.556
We've put out an APB
for Billy and his gang.

01:03:19.946 --> 01:03:23.109
I can't believe I didn't see
what was going on with you.

01:03:23.583 --> 01:03:25.676
How could you do what you did?

01:03:27.787 --> 01:03:31.120
You thought you could balance the equation?

01:03:32.158 --> 01:03:33.887
Put order in the universe?

01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:37.387
I lost my boy.

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.328
Your boy.

01:03:50.844 --> 01:03:52.744
You are a good father.

01:03:54.047 --> 01:03:56.481
And nothing that's happened changes that.

01:04:00.353 --> 01:04:01.718
And I love you.

01:04:03.823 --> 01:04:05.347
And I always will.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.219
It's good that
you're getting rid of it anyway.

01:05:08.621 --> 01:05:09.645
Yeah.

01:06:24.597 --> 01:06:25.291
No.

01:06:25.465 --> 01:06:26.432
Mom.

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:42.411
Fucking get out.

01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:44.475
Mom.

01:06:47.187 --> 01:06:47.551
Get over here.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.687
Get over here.

01:06:49.689 --> 01:06:50.656
Sup, Billy.

01:07:08.341 --> 01:07:08.670
No.

01:07:08.842 --> 01:07:10.173
No.

01:07:12.078 --> 01:07:13.272
No.

01:07:43.877 --> 01:07:48.780
Tonight I lack the strengthen to even move.

01:07:50.283 --> 01:07:54.481
And you walked and watched me die.

01:07:56.656 --> 01:08:00.888
But I know this is harder for you.

01:08:03.129 --> 01:08:07.657
Because love has beat you down.

01:08:08.568 --> 01:08:11.093
Yeah, come on.

01:08:21.247 --> 01:08:23.977
You know you're not alone.

01:08:37.397 --> 01:08:37.988
Doctor.

01:08:38.163 --> 01:08:39.062
Doctor.

01:08:40.566 --> 01:08:41.794
Hold the legs.

01:08:42.969 --> 01:08:43.901
Sedate him.

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:45.462
Hold him down.

01:09:19.872 --> 01:09:21.203
Can you turn that off?

01:09:21.506 --> 01:09:22.974
The monitor or your heart?

01:09:25.111 --> 01:09:26.372
I'll ask the doctor.

01:09:33.519 --> 01:09:36.010
This thing stops. Right now.

01:09:37.657 --> 01:09:39.420
God knows why you're still alive,

01:09:40.026 --> 01:09:41.720
but you're being given a second chance.

01:09:43.162 --> 01:09:45.323
You think that officer's out there
protecting you?

01:09:45.798 --> 01:09:47.857
He's protecting you from yourself?

01:09:48.201 --> 01:09:50.669
He'll haul your ass right to jail
if I say so.

01:09:51.504 --> 01:09:52.562
You want your retribution,

01:09:52.738 --> 01:09:55.264
and you killed a couple of punks,
and it bought you what?

01:09:56.576 --> 01:09:58.942
Everybody thinks they're right in a war.

01:10:00.747 --> 01:10:02.374
Everybody still dies in the end.

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:04.909
You were never going to win this, Mr. Hume.

01:10:05.084 --> 01:10:06.142
Nobody is.

01:10:08.388 --> 01:10:09.685
I killed them.

01:10:11.758 --> 01:10:13.282
I killed my family.

01:10:15.595 --> 01:10:18.029
Well, your son's still alive.

01:10:19.499 --> 01:10:19.897
What?

01:10:20.066 --> 01:10:21.033
Barely.

01:10:22.201 --> 01:10:23.225
Where is he?

01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:25.702
Is he here? Where is he?

01:10:25.938 --> 01:10:27.405
Hey, come on. Wait a second now.

01:10:27.573 --> 01:10:28.301
Luke.

01:10:28.841 --> 01:10:29.637
Luke.

01:10:30.209 --> 01:10:31.301
Luke?

01:10:31.511 --> 01:10:32.535
- He's alright. Let him go.
- Lucas?

01:10:32.712 --> 01:10:34.475
- Sir, you need to get back to bed.
- Where is my son?

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:35.511
Tell me where my son is.

01:10:35.681 --> 01:10:37.444
He's in room 206.

01:10:37.617 --> 01:10:38.606
Lukey?

01:10:38.885 --> 01:10:39.442
Luke?

01:10:39.619 --> 01:10:40.847
We're taking care of your son.

01:10:41.054 --> 01:10:43.579
- Doctor... It's ok. Just let him through.
- Luke?

01:10:58.271 --> 01:10:59.568
Is he going to wake up?

01:11:00.473 --> 01:11:01.804
I can't say right now.

01:11:09.782 --> 01:11:11.340
It was never going to balance.

01:11:14.921 --> 01:11:16.081
What did you say?

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:18.755
The equation.

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:24.286
Sometimes it's just chaos.

01:11:25.932 --> 01:11:27.331
That's all there is.

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:34.028
I'd like a minute with him.

01:11:40.279 --> 01:11:41.303
Please.

01:11:48.788 --> 01:11:49.777
I'll be waiting.

01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:01.431
Hey, Luke, can you hear me?

01:12:04.937 --> 01:12:06.302
Can you move your fingers?

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.299
Son, just move your fingers
if you can hear me.

01:12:16.949 --> 01:12:18.211
Luke, I know that

01:12:19.018 --> 01:12:20.349
you think that...

01:12:21.454 --> 01:12:24.423
I didn't care about you
as much as your brother.

01:12:26.292 --> 01:12:27.589
God, I...

01:12:27.894 --> 01:12:29.657
I don't know, maybe I didn't at first.

01:12:31.364 --> 01:12:32.353
You know...

01:12:34.167 --> 01:12:35.566
when you mom and I

01:12:37.069 --> 01:12:38.468
first had Brendan...

01:12:39.872 --> 01:12:41.032
he was just...

01:12:42.074 --> 01:12:43.666
he was so amazing to me, you know.

01:12:43.843 --> 01:12:47.540
He was like this miracle kid.

01:12:48.514 --> 01:12:51.039
But I always knew exactly
what to expect with him.

01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:54.078
And then when you came along...

01:12:54.854 --> 01:12:57.288
I don't know, I kind of expected to

01:12:58.891 --> 01:13:00.188
have another Brendan, you know.

01:13:00.359 --> 01:13:01.724
I expected you to be just like him,

01:13:01.894 --> 01:13:02.952
but you weren't.

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:04.756
I mean you were so different,

01:13:04.931 --> 01:13:06.796
just different than him, different than me.

01:13:07.166 --> 01:13:08.633
You were just so much more...

01:13:09.068 --> 01:13:10.763
so much more like your mom, you know...

01:13:10.937 --> 01:13:11.926
stubborn and...

01:13:16.742 --> 01:13:18.209
Too much passion.

01:13:24.116 --> 01:13:25.174
Your mother.

01:13:27.053 --> 01:13:29.078
Oh, she meant the world to me.

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:32.889
And so do you.

01:13:35.228 --> 01:13:38.220
I just want you to know that I love you.

01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:41.793
I love you so much.

01:13:44.136 --> 01:13:46.331
I love your brother
and I love your mother...

01:13:47.039 --> 01:13:48.631
I love our family

01:13:49.075 --> 01:13:50.201
and I...

01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:59.550
I'm so sorry

01:14:00.486 --> 01:14:02.386
that I wasn't a better father.

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:07.489
I'm so sorry

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:10.954
that I couldn't protect you guys.

01:14:58.544 --> 01:14:59.476
Shit.

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:09.513
Hey you, get a doctor, right now.

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:55.228
Hey, Owen.

01:15:55.668 --> 01:15:58.034
I need you to check a number for me.

01:15:59.004 --> 01:16:01.837
Yeah, 5550128.

01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:04.538
Well, check somewhere else.
Just get it for me.

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:07.210
And the savings too, huh?

01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:08.176
Yeah, everything.

01:16:08.414 --> 01:16:09.176
All of it.

01:16:09.348 --> 01:16:11.145
Pulling out the kids' college fund, huh?

01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:45.573
Hello?

01:16:45.751 --> 01:16:46.809
Hey, Nick, it's Owen.

01:16:47.086 --> 01:16:48.178
Yeah, I got that number run.

01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:50.584
It's a bar. 'The Four Roses.'

01:16:50.756 --> 01:16:51.484
Nick, what's going on?

01:16:51.657 --> 01:16:52.487
Do you need me to call anyone?

01:16:52.658 --> 01:16:53.920
Thanks. Goodbye. Owen.

01:16:54.093 --> 01:16:54.957
Nick?

01:17:13.846 --> 01:17:16.406
I'm looking for Billy Darley
or any of his friends.

01:17:17.316 --> 01:17:21.946
"IN SPANISH"

01:17:38.537 --> 01:17:40.596
"IN SPANISH"

01:17:56.155 --> 01:17:57.053
Fuck you.

01:17:59.058 --> 01:17:59.456
Fuck you.

01:17:59.525 --> 01:18:01.220
Fuck you. Back it up.

01:18:02.695 --> 01:18:04.856
Let me go...

01:18:05.164 --> 01:18:07.359
You tell me where Billy Darley is.

01:18:07.733 --> 01:18:08.825
Tell me right now.

01:18:09.001 --> 01:18:10.025
Right now.

01:18:10.369 --> 01:18:12.360
You don't want Billy Darley, buddy.

01:18:13.506 --> 01:18:16.202
I got business with him.

01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:18.574
Okay, let me go.

01:18:18.777 --> 01:18:19.675
Let me go.

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:22.877
"IN SPANISH"

01:18:26.051 --> 01:18:29.316
His boy Heco is crashing at 113,
up the block.

01:18:29.722 --> 01:18:32.520
He's usually hooking up
around dinner time, you know?

01:18:33.025 --> 01:18:34.151
Okay?

01:18:34.994 --> 01:18:36.859
"IN SPANISH"

01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:39.655
One more thing.

01:18:41.233 --> 01:18:43.064
I need to buy some guns.

01:18:56.782 --> 01:18:57.771
Help you?

01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:00.713
I need guns.

01:19:11.530 --> 01:19:12.724
I don't know you.

01:19:13.198 --> 01:19:15.029
I came from the 'Four Roses.'

01:19:17.102 --> 01:19:18.433
I'm going to guess

01:19:19.572 --> 01:19:21.437
you're a little bit far from home.

01:19:27.046 --> 01:19:30.948
Well, don't let me smell fear on you.

01:19:31.917 --> 01:19:34.647
Fear is for the enemy.

01:19:35.087 --> 01:19:36.145
Fear

01:19:37.156 --> 01:19:38.248
and bullets.

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:47.658
Lots of fucking bullets.

01:19:48.901 --> 01:19:51.495
You got the bastard of bastards.

01:19:51.804 --> 01:19:53.294
.357...

01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:55.370
for guaranteed head removal.

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:57.475
That's a sweetie.

01:19:58.611 --> 01:20:01.774
You got your standard size.45,

01:20:02.648 --> 01:20:04.138
super size.

01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:07.418
That's a fucking 'Hungry Man' right there.

01:20:07.853 --> 01:20:10.083
And you got the king of mayhem.

01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:13.590
Half cannon, sword of justice.

01:20:13.759 --> 01:20:15.886
Take this fucker to the Holy Land,

01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:17.824
start your own crusade.

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:19.796
Any one of these...

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:21.828
is bound to make you feel better

01:20:22.001 --> 01:20:23.764
about what's bothering you.

01:20:52.231 --> 01:20:53.323
What about that one?

01:20:55.367 --> 01:20:56.391
This one?

01:21:11.383 --> 01:21:13.817
All right, I'll take this and these.

01:21:14.353 --> 01:21:17.379
That's three fucking grand worth
of killing.

01:21:17.556 --> 01:21:19.683
You got three grand worth of killing to do?

01:21:24.496 --> 01:21:25.622
There's five.

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:28.596
Well, that makes
you a preferred customer.

01:21:32.171 --> 01:21:35.163
I'm going to give you some accessories.

01:21:36.108 --> 01:21:37.905
Just because you got a thing about you.

01:21:38.377 --> 01:21:42.074
You have got a killing thing about you...

01:21:42.247 --> 01:21:43.578
you surely do.

01:22:03.802 --> 01:22:06.168
You the motherfucker after my son Billy?

01:22:14.246 --> 01:22:15.213
He's your son?

01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:18.372
That'd make you
the motherfucker killed Joe, that right?

01:22:18.650 --> 01:22:20.140
You killed my youngest?

01:22:20.452 --> 01:22:22.181
Now you're after Billy, yeah?

01:22:24.256 --> 01:22:27.589
Yeah, I'm after him.

01:22:31.563 --> 01:22:33.463
Well, Billy is no damn doing of mine.

01:22:35.467 --> 01:22:37.697
Anything he did is no damn doing of mine.

01:22:39.438 --> 01:22:43.101
So somebody needs to
make somebody pay for something

01:22:43.275 --> 01:22:45.209
to make themselves feel better...

01:22:46.512 --> 01:22:48.173
Billy'd be the one to pay.

01:22:48.947 --> 01:22:50.574
Kill the little piss-pants.

01:22:50.816 --> 01:22:53.512
See if it makes
a damn day's difference to me.

01:22:54.753 --> 01:22:56.118
Dad to dad,

01:22:57.055 --> 01:22:58.386
don't tell me about it.

01:22:58.557 --> 01:23:00.889
Just go do it.

01:23:02.427 --> 01:23:04.122
Lord knows I've been patient.

01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:06.891
And you're a cash fucking customer.

01:23:08.901 --> 01:23:11.836
But you think about
asking me where Billy is.

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.902
I'll kill you.

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:20.639
Go your way, now.

01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:25.046
Go with God...

01:23:25.517 --> 01:23:27.246
and a bag full of guns.

01:27:12.677 --> 01:27:16.943
Going to focus on the pain.

01:27:19.117 --> 01:27:20.311
The...

01:27:22.721 --> 01:27:23.619
What the fuck?

01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:25.820
What the fuck? Who the fuck?

01:27:27.759 --> 01:27:28.726
You?

01:27:29.561 --> 01:27:31.085
We fucking killed you.

01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:32.522
What the fuck?

01:27:39.504 --> 01:27:40.562
Get the fuck out of here.

01:27:42.307 --> 01:27:43.171
Where is Billy?

01:27:43.842 --> 01:27:44.968
Fuck you.

01:27:47.479 --> 01:27:48.878
That's my tooth, you asshole.

01:27:49.047 --> 01:27:50.514
Tell me where the fuck he is.

01:27:51.516 --> 01:27:52.744
The office.

01:27:52.951 --> 01:27:53.849
The office.

01:27:54.086 --> 01:27:55.212
What the fuck is that?

01:27:56.021 --> 01:27:58.319
It's the abandoned mental hospital.

01:27:58.590 --> 01:28:00.217
It's where we cook our shit, dude.

01:28:00.659 --> 01:28:02.752
It's by the bridge on Stygian Street.

01:28:03.061 --> 01:28:04.961
All right, man? Stygian Street.

01:28:09.134 --> 01:28:10.066
Call him.

01:28:11.303 --> 01:28:12.736
Good thing your daddy
got you some training wheels...

01:28:12.904 --> 01:28:15.873
so you don't have to Rollerblade over here
for your fucking sister's habit, huh?

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:18.005
She's been a good customer
of mine for a while.

01:28:18.176 --> 01:28:20.201
I been a pretty great customer of hers too.

01:28:25.083 --> 01:28:26.141
Fucking prick.

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:31.655
Heco, you sandbagging son of a bitch...

01:28:31.823 --> 01:28:32.812
it is the second time this week...

01:28:32.991 --> 01:28:34.583
- I had to cover for your ass.
- Billy.

01:28:37.262 --> 01:28:38.923
That fucker didn't die, Billy.

01:28:39.464 --> 01:28:41.523
That fucker didn't die, Billy.

01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:45.498
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:48.672
He says you're sentenced.

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:56.669
So what?

01:28:59.618 --> 01:29:01.415
So this, motherfucker.

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:26.672
What are we fucking up tonight, son?

01:29:26.845 --> 01:29:28.039
What the fuck do you want now?

01:29:28.213 --> 01:29:30.204
You look like you're in a fucking hurry.

01:29:31.349 --> 01:29:33.214
You know how much I got to
wipe your fucking nose?

01:29:33.618 --> 01:29:36.382
I got to get some
Fortune Five Hundred faggot off my back...

01:29:36.555 --> 01:29:39.524
by telling him he can fucking have you,
you think I enjoyed that?

01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:41.755
What you don't get is...

01:29:42.661 --> 01:29:44.822
I care about what happens to you

01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:46.998
because it can fucking hurt me.

01:29:47.199 --> 01:29:49.690
Now do you need any more
fucking instructions?

01:29:54.673 --> 01:29:55.901
No. Thanks, dad.

01:29:56.942 --> 01:29:58.204
I'm taking the car.

01:30:50.996 --> 01:30:51.826
What the fuck?

01:30:54.266 --> 01:30:54.925
Shit.

01:32:02.334 --> 01:32:02.823
Dog.

01:32:03.001 --> 01:32:03.865
Son of a bitch is coming.

01:32:04.035 --> 01:32:05.024
Straight at you, man.

01:32:08.373 --> 01:32:09.237
My leg.

01:32:10.408 --> 01:32:11.033
Dog.

01:32:11.209 --> 01:32:13.769
Go. You fuck.

01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:46.367
I'm gonna kill you.
Son of the bitch.

01:33:29.587 --> 01:33:33.387
Go get him. Go...

01:34:00.385 --> 01:34:03.411
Come on...

01:34:45.463 --> 01:34:46.953
...Go that way...

01:35:26.938 --> 01:35:29.600
You know you're going to die in here.

01:35:48.893 --> 01:35:49.587
Fuck.

01:37:58.289 --> 01:37:59.483
Look at you.

01:38:01.959 --> 01:38:03.790
You look like one of us.

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:10.792
Look what I made you.

01:38:45.236 --> 01:38:46.225
Ready?

01:38:50.108 --> 01:38:54.943
Tonight I lack the strengthen to even move.

01:38:56.447 --> 01:39:00.747
And you walked and watched me die.

01:39:02.887 --> 01:39:07.153
But I know this is harder for you.

01:39:09.327 --> 01:39:13.593
Because love has beat you down.

01:39:14.699 --> 01:39:16.690
Yeah, come on.

01:39:27.311 --> 01:39:30.280
You know you're not alone.

01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:39.656
Any New Year's resolutions?

01:39:40.992 --> 01:39:42.084
No, you know mom's perfect.

01:39:42.226 --> 01:39:43.284
Oh, well, that's for sure.

01:39:43.461 --> 01:39:44.553
Nah, I got nothing.

01:39:46.731 --> 01:39:50.497
Five, four, three, two, one.

01:39:50.668 --> 01:39:52.033
Happy New Year.

01:39:52.136 --> 01:39:53.603
Happy New Year.

01:39:54.472 --> 01:39:56.303
All right, what do you expect this year?

01:39:57.074 --> 01:39:58.132
Your son.

01:39:59.710 --> 01:40:01.109
He started moving.

01:40:03.114 --> 01:40:04.581
I think he's going to pull through.

01:40:14.892 --> 01:40:17.690
Should old acquaintance be forgot.

01:40:17.862 --> 01:40:22.629
And never brought to mind.
