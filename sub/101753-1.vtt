WEBVTT

00:17.415 --> 00:20.665
(light dramatic music)

02:23.378 --> 02:25.680
(women panting and moaning)

02:25.680 --> 02:27.793
- Can we, can we talk about something?

02:28.703 --> 02:30.003
- No, not right now.

02:30.877 --> 02:31.843
- Renee, listen.

02:37.300 --> 02:39.470
- You don't wanna do this anymore?

02:39.470 --> 02:41.127
- It's not that, I just...

02:51.753 --> 02:52.623
Wait, wait-

02:52.623 --> 02:54.423
- Give me something to work with.

03:00.520 --> 03:01.723
- What? What is it?

03:02.740 --> 03:04.073
- Do you still want this?

03:05.600 --> 03:06.453
- More than ever.

03:07.490 --> 03:09.640
- Then promise me we'll
work something out.

03:13.170 --> 03:15.473
- I don't, I don't know what that means.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.950
- I...
(door opens)

03:26.271 --> 03:28.350
(footsteps approaching)

03:28.350 --> 03:30.190
- [Juliette] I told you we're
not delivering on anything

03:30.190 --> 03:31.803
less than our usual cut.

03:35.370 --> 03:36.790
Come again?

03:36.790 --> 03:37.990
You're breaking up.

03:37.990 --> 03:40.020
No, it can't be on my
end. It must be on yours.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.403
Call me back when you
get a better signal, bye!

03:43.730 --> 03:45.943
These headsets are such pieces of shit.

03:48.950 --> 03:49.783
Renee?

03:51.910 --> 03:53.523
I know your shoes, Renee.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.111
(toilet flushes)
- Yeah, it's me.

04:02.020 --> 04:03.070
- Do you have a dick?

04:05.070 --> 04:05.903
- A what?

04:08.813 --> 04:09.913
- You have a dick now?

04:11.064 --> 04:12.350
Like you were peeing standing up.

04:12.350 --> 04:14.200
- Wow, you definitely just said that.

04:15.538 --> 04:17.170
- Lighten up.

04:17.170 --> 04:19.393
- I was just tossing the coffee.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.110
- You seem a little out of it.

04:24.110 --> 04:26.560
You barely said a word on
that call this morning.

04:27.610 --> 04:30.760
- Yeah, I'm fine.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.970
Just a lot on my mind.

04:32.970 --> 04:35.390
- Well, we all need to be 100%

04:35.390 --> 04:37.120
over the next couple of months.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.170
- 20% of the company just
got let go this week.

04:40.170 --> 04:42.950
- Then make it 120%.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.960
If you're worried about
the layoffs, you're safe.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.050
- What does that mean?

04:47.050 --> 04:49.250
- That means I got to
weigh in on our department.

04:49.250 --> 04:50.207
- They asked you.

04:51.905 --> 04:55.410
- You seem surprised that I
didn't throw you under the bus.

04:55.410 --> 04:57.460
Can you imagine the
weight on my shoulders?

04:57.460 --> 05:00.083
- I don't know. How does it feel?

05:01.730 --> 05:04.200
- Fan-fucking-tastic actually.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.790
I was on the call when
they announced the cuts

05:05.790 --> 05:07.630
and the budget for next quarter.

05:07.630 --> 05:10.803
Stocks rose faster than
their shriveled lil' dicks.

05:11.940 --> 05:13.090
- Charming.

05:13.090 --> 05:13.993
- Guess how high.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.520
Seriously, guess.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.273
- In inches or?

05:21.184 --> 05:23.220
2%.
- 7%

05:24.590 --> 05:26.310
I'm cracking open a bottle of Veuve

05:26.310 --> 05:27.720
at the end of the day in my office.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.573
Swing by if you want.

05:29.573 --> 05:30.923
- I think I'll pass.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.043
- Is that her?
- Is that who?

05:37.770 --> 05:39.970
Figured you were sore
about your girlfriend.

05:42.090 --> 05:43.600
- Girlfriend?

05:43.600 --> 05:44.433
- Catalina.

05:46.420 --> 05:48.820
Don't play dumb. She was my assistant.

05:48.820 --> 05:51.470
It was pretty obvious you
two had something going on.

05:52.900 --> 05:54.350
- What would I be sore about?

05:55.200 --> 05:56.373
- The layoffs.

05:58.480 --> 05:59.480
She didn't tell you?

06:02.770 --> 06:04.913
- No, she didn't tell me yet.

06:07.020 --> 06:09.773
- Well, no hard feelings.

06:10.660 --> 06:12.000
I mean, if I were...

06:13.056 --> 06:14.810
I'd be all over that too.

06:14.810 --> 06:15.823
- What the fuck.

06:17.090 --> 06:18.530
- You are taking this hard.

06:18.530 --> 06:20.867
- Yeah, I can take that
a little bit personally.

06:20.867 --> 06:21.963
- Fair enough.

06:23.230 --> 06:24.870
It had nothing to do with you.

06:24.870 --> 06:27.000
In fact, the higher ups
are really impressed

06:27.000 --> 06:28.113
with your performance.

06:29.028 --> 06:32.173
It's amazing how little
action worked wonders for you.

06:33.430 --> 06:37.060
Or maybe she was giving you
information about my clients

06:37.060 --> 06:39.540
'cause you always seemed
to be just one step ahead.

06:39.540 --> 06:41.290
- Do you think I'm capable of that?

06:42.660 --> 06:44.600
- Why else were you with her?

06:44.600 --> 06:46.573
Did you really see a future together?

06:48.100 --> 06:49.550
Seems like I did you a favor.

06:51.230 --> 06:53.030
- You know, it's a little pathetic

06:53.030 --> 06:55.400
when you're the only
one playing this game.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.530
- So, it was just a fling?

06:57.530 --> 06:59.014
- Just a fling.

06:59.014 --> 07:00.490
- Then no harm done.

07:00.490 --> 07:02.410
You'll find another little plaything soon.

07:02.410 --> 07:06.003
Hey, maybe my new assistant,
you might like him.

07:07.410 --> 07:08.360
Oh, but you're...

07:09.510 --> 07:12.423
But you can switch teams
whenever it suits you, right?

07:13.510 --> 07:14.460
- You know me.

07:15.630 --> 07:17.780
- Don't sell yourself short,
break it off with her.

07:17.780 --> 07:19.330
Maybe there's hope for you yet.

07:25.286 --> 07:26.713
You're out of paper towels.

07:27.950 --> 07:30.700
- Maybe you shouldn't have
cut half the cleaning staff.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.533
- I'll be fine.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.963
Alex, talk to me.

07:35.870 --> 07:37.020
You're killing me here.

08:08.110 --> 08:09.253
- I'm so sorry, Cat.

08:12.090 --> 08:15.333
- Was I just a fling? Just
your little plaything?

08:16.210 --> 08:17.533
- Juliette said plaything.

08:19.370 --> 08:21.370
- I tried to tell you what was going on.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.270
- When's your last day?

08:27.760 --> 08:28.593
- Today.

08:30.140 --> 08:31.033
- So let's talk.

08:33.810 --> 08:35.850
- Maybe she was right.

08:35.850 --> 08:37.203
Maybe you were using me.

08:38.779 --> 08:40.513
- You're taking her side now?

08:41.491 --> 08:42.700
- You know what, I tried to
take your fucking side before,

08:42.700 --> 08:44.100
but guess what?

08:44.100 --> 08:45.423
I don't know anymore.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.433
- So you don't trust me?

08:49.470 --> 08:51.420
- Why couldn't you answer her question?

08:55.910 --> 08:58.123
Do we have a future together?

09:04.550 --> 09:06.763
- I think so.
- Then say it.

09:14.810 --> 09:16.043
I think you should go.

09:51.603 --> 09:54.210
(box of tissues clattering)

09:54.210 --> 09:55.083
- Nice.

10:10.780 --> 10:13.197
(gun firing)

10:17.691 --> 10:20.608
(people screaming)

10:23.379 --> 10:24.212
Oh, shit!

10:28.730 --> 10:31.813
(Catalina sniffling)

10:42.694 --> 10:44.143
- [911 Operator] 911,
what is your emergency?

10:44.143 --> 10:46.803
- I think I heard gunshots
on my office building.

10:51.310 --> 10:52.753
- [911 operator] Are
you in a safe location?

10:52.753 --> 10:55.843
- I'm in the ladies
room, I think it's safe.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.750
I don't know, I think-

10:58.750 --> 11:00.063
- [911 Operator] Are you alone?

11:01.850 --> 11:02.950
- Can the police come?

11:03.846 --> 11:05.130
- [911 Operator] Units have
already been dispatched.

11:05.130 --> 11:08.249
If you feel it's unsafe
to leave your location,

11:08.249 --> 11:11.259
stay put, stay quiet, lock the door

11:11.259 --> 11:12.736
and barricade if you can.

11:12.736 --> 11:14.319
- All right, hurry.

11:15.436 --> 11:17.333
- [911 Operator] Do
you have a description-

11:17.333 --> 11:20.583
(light dramatic music)

11:26.518 --> 11:27.351
- Cat?

11:29.611 --> 11:30.694
Are you okay?

11:33.359 --> 11:36.526
All you have to do is just keep quiet.

11:42.361 --> 11:44.944
(phone buzzes)

12:01.286 --> 12:03.703
(gun firing)

12:21.748 --> 12:23.165
Come on, respond!

12:37.436 --> 12:39.563
(door opening)

12:39.563 --> 12:42.480
(Juliette gasping)

12:47.274 --> 12:48.601
- Renee?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.101
- Juls.
- Oh, shit!

12:51.014 --> 12:52.464
Holy fucking shit!

12:52.464 --> 12:54.091
- What happened?
- I don't know.

12:54.091 --> 12:55.140
What did you see?
- Nothing.

12:55.140 --> 12:56.563
I, I, I heard shots.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.713
I don't know.

13:00.020 --> 13:00.853
Jesus.

13:01.901 --> 13:04.753
I saw people running so I
just ran as fast as I can.

13:06.530 --> 13:08.367
Oh my God. Oh my God.

13:10.949 --> 13:12.532
Get this off of me.

13:13.794 --> 13:16.075
(Juliette panting)

13:16.075 --> 13:16.908
Oh God.

13:21.038 --> 13:22.871
I did this.
- Did what?

13:24.104 --> 13:28.771
The cuts, I have pushed some
poor bastard over the edge.

13:29.990 --> 13:31.473
This is on me.

13:39.950 --> 13:41.693
- We can hide until this blows over.

13:43.020 --> 13:44.220
Police are on their way.

13:45.510 --> 13:46.360
Come on.
- God.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.453
Alex. Alex, are you still at your desk?

13:52.520 --> 13:53.353
Alex?

13:55.235 --> 13:56.402
Piece of shit.

13:57.380 --> 13:58.430
- I'm sure he's fine.

14:07.197 --> 14:08.030
- I'm sorry.

14:10.847 --> 14:12.323
- None of that matters now.

14:15.350 --> 14:16.963
- I know I've been difficult.

14:18.150 --> 14:20.419
- Everything's under control now.

14:20.419 --> 14:22.836
(gun firing)

14:24.415 --> 14:25.805
- Maybe we should make a run for it.

14:25.805 --> 14:26.776
- No.

14:26.776 --> 14:27.609
- We should make a run for it and-

14:27.609 --> 14:28.483
- No, we're safe in here.

14:30.093 --> 14:35.093
(woman screams)
(gun fires)

14:36.911 --> 14:39.828
- [Woman] He's coming, he's coming.

14:43.829 --> 14:45.639
- What if they're hurt?

14:45.639 --> 14:46.640
- What if the shooter
is right behind them?

14:46.640 --> 14:49.363
No, just leave them,
maybe they'll go away.

14:52.839 --> 14:55.256
(gun firing)

15:00.510 --> 15:02.067
What are you doing?
Are you posting online?

15:02.960 --> 15:04.060
- I'm texting someone.

15:06.290 --> 15:08.623
- [Dale] Is anyone in there?

15:10.329 --> 15:11.280
- We should help him.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.490
- Maybe he's the shooter.

15:13.490 --> 15:15.393
- [Dale] I can hear you.

15:15.393 --> 15:17.053
Please, please open up.

15:24.696 --> 15:26.446
- What are you doing?

15:30.240 --> 15:31.573
- [Dale] Please.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.708
- Renee, don't.

15:35.708 --> 15:38.399
- [Dale] I can hear you in there. Oh, God!

15:38.399 --> 15:39.732
Please.
- Don't.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.893
Oh, God. (panting)

15:48.130 --> 15:48.983
- Are you hurt?

15:51.310 --> 15:52.143
Keep it down.

15:53.230 --> 15:54.550
Are you hurt?

15:54.550 --> 15:57.156
- [Dale] I don't know, there's blood.

15:57.156 --> 15:57.989
There's blood-

15:57.989 --> 15:59.642
- What's wrong with the men's room?

15:59.642 --> 16:02.450
- [Dale] I just came from
there, it's fucking bad.

16:02.450 --> 16:03.550
- Hide someplace else.

16:05.226 --> 16:07.559
- [Dale] I'm scared, please.

16:08.429 --> 16:09.429
- So are we.

16:10.772 --> 16:12.894
(door rattling)

16:12.894 --> 16:15.662
- Did you hear something?

16:15.662 --> 16:17.640
(Dale banging door)

16:17.640 --> 16:21.307
- He's making too much noise.
- Renee, don't!

16:24.056 --> 16:27.139
- Oh God, (gasping).

16:40.211 --> 16:41.044
Thank you.

16:46.679 --> 16:48.429
Thank you, thank you.

17:04.891 --> 17:07.724
(water splashing)

17:13.590 --> 17:14.953
So fucking bad out there.

17:16.390 --> 17:18.140
- How did you get past the shooter?

17:19.940 --> 17:21.060
- I don't know.

17:21.060 --> 17:22.127
- Did you see him?

17:29.348 --> 17:30.181
- No.

17:37.813 --> 17:40.213
- I don't recognize you,
what department you in?

17:42.010 --> 17:45.060
- I know him. He's in security

17:47.470 --> 17:49.313
- Yeah, I was.

17:52.028 --> 17:54.253
I came to pick up my last check.

17:55.401 --> 17:57.565
- Are you part of the layoffs?

17:57.565 --> 18:01.343
- Yeah.
(paper towel ripping)

18:07.140 --> 18:08.390
- Did you get your check?

18:11.088 --> 18:12.538
- No, I didn't make it there.

18:14.530 --> 18:15.913
- How about an ID badge?

18:18.320 --> 18:21.043
- His name is Dale. He's not lying.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.363
- I must've lost it.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.640
- Why are you on the eighth floor?

18:31.710 --> 18:32.543
- Juls.

18:34.049 --> 18:35.723
- I don't know where accounting is, lady.

18:36.630 --> 18:38.430
- Accounting is on the second floor.

18:40.530 --> 18:42.100
- That's good to know.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.513
- How long have you worked here?

18:49.840 --> 18:50.773
- Three years.

19:05.419 --> 19:08.560
I'll just stay over here, okay?

19:08.560 --> 19:09.393
- Yeah.

19:11.231 --> 19:14.481
(drier whirring)
Fuck.

19:16.062 --> 19:19.312
(light dramatic music)

19:40.630 --> 19:42.180
- We can get through this, Cat.

20:02.362 --> 20:04.494
- What the fuck are we doing?

20:04.494 --> 20:05.557
What are you doing?
- Quiet.

20:05.557 --> 20:07.087
You were texting someone.
- Yeah.

20:07.087 --> 20:09.750
Someone in the building?
- Yeah.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.100
Maybe they saw the shooter.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.340
- I don't know, she's not responding.

20:14.340 --> 20:16.403
- Fuck. Sorry.

20:19.173 --> 20:20.930
- Maybe she lost it.

20:20.930 --> 20:21.763
Yeah, maybe.

20:21.763 --> 20:24.840
Look, our guy's story isn't adding up.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.550
- We've no idea what he's been through.

20:26.550 --> 20:28.553
- No, something doesn't feel right.

20:28.553 --> 20:31.350
I think I saw him before
the shooting started.

20:31.350 --> 20:32.680
- He said he didn't say anything.

20:32.680 --> 20:35.000
- Things are starting
to come back to me now.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.590
- You saw him?

20:36.590 --> 20:38.000
- I don't know (indistinct).

20:38.000 --> 20:40.150
We haven't heard a
gunshot since he got in.

21:01.018 --> 21:03.070
- You're overreacting.

21:03.070 --> 21:04.017
- You know I'm right.

21:04.017 --> 21:07.240
- You're not wrong but it's
not exactly a smoking gun.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.323
- It's the only thing that makes sense.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.180
Why did you have to let him in here?

21:12.180 --> 21:13.910
- He said he was hit.

21:13.910 --> 21:15.033
- He lied about that.

21:16.176 --> 21:18.220
- I'm not gonna send him
back out there to die.

21:18.220 --> 21:19.090
- Then I will.

21:28.124 --> 21:30.207
Where the fuck did he go?

21:43.900 --> 21:45.100
- Respecting your space.

21:46.350 --> 21:48.990
This is also a better
place to listen from, so...

21:51.387 --> 21:52.800
- Probably for the best.

21:53.809 --> 21:55.430
- Hey, did you guys check
for like a vent or something

21:55.430 --> 21:56.480
we can escape out of?

21:57.570 --> 21:59.247
- This isn't fucking "Die Hard".

22:00.530 --> 22:01.930
- Thank you. That's helpful.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.730
- I think we're just
a little on edge here.

22:05.730 --> 22:06.563
- Agreed.

22:20.830 --> 22:22.730
- Can I use one of the stalls, please?

22:23.920 --> 22:24.753
- No.

22:25.883 --> 22:28.520
- Come on, I'll be quick.

22:28.520 --> 22:29.353
- No.

22:31.636 --> 22:33.123
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

22:38.039 --> 22:39.862
- What the fuck are you doing?

22:39.862 --> 22:40.695
- Gonna piss right here.

22:40.695 --> 22:43.149
- What, go ahead, here, just go.

22:43.149 --> 22:44.149
- Thank you.

22:45.649 --> 22:46.680
Would you like to sit in the chair

22:46.680 --> 22:48.990
and lock the door with your body?

22:48.990 --> 22:49.823
- Just go.

22:54.759 --> 22:56.950
Was that a gun?
- That was a gun.

22:56.950 --> 22:58.410
Told you we should haven't let him in.

22:58.410 --> 23:00.020
- He needed help, he's security.

23:00.020 --> 23:02.341
- He was security.

23:02.341 --> 23:03.230
- [Dale] Can you guys please talk?

23:03.230 --> 23:05.610
I can't do this with you listening.

23:05.610 --> 23:07.670
- What, now you've got stage fright?

23:07.670 --> 23:09.413
- [Dale] Wasn't really gonna whip it out.

23:13.001 --> 23:14.834
- Knew it.
- We talked.

23:16.126 --> 23:19.086
Right, and then he fucking shoots us

23:19.086 --> 23:21.086
and then we fucking die.

23:25.757 --> 23:28.424
(pee trickling)

23:33.923 --> 23:36.113
- [Dale] I didn't flush
for obvious reasons.

23:38.640 --> 23:41.430
- I think we don't feel comfortable

23:41.430 --> 23:43.203
with you in here with us anymore.

23:49.450 --> 23:50.283
- Really?

23:51.962 --> 23:53.470
I'm not a fucking pervert.

23:53.470 --> 23:55.823
I just, I just came to hide.

23:56.975 --> 23:57.808
That's it.

23:58.910 --> 24:00.463
- Just leave.

24:03.460 --> 24:05.160
- You just want me to fucking die.

24:08.033 --> 24:10.940
(scoffs) I'll leave
when the cops get here.

24:20.833 --> 24:22.798
- Fuck this.

24:22.798 --> 24:24.070
- What the fuck are you doing?

24:24.070 --> 24:25.759
(gun clatters)

24:25.759 --> 24:28.180
(blow lands)

24:28.180 --> 24:29.013
- Gun!

24:31.021 --> 24:33.438
(blow lands)

24:36.595 --> 24:39.012
(blow lands)

24:51.780 --> 24:53.697
- Who the fuck are you?

24:55.081 --> 24:57.133
You guys knew she was in
there the whole fucking time?

24:59.970 --> 25:01.103
- Don't move!

25:03.440 --> 25:05.320
- Juliette, I said don't fucking move.

25:05.320 --> 25:09.010
- Catalina, you watch where
you're pointing that gun.

25:09.010 --> 25:10.250
- Stop talking.

25:10.250 --> 25:11.453
- Lower the gun, Cat.

25:12.590 --> 25:14.850
- Let me, let me think.

25:14.850 --> 25:16.090
- We can talk about this.

25:16.090 --> 25:16.923
- Let me think!

25:18.640 --> 25:20.587
- Seriously, who the fuck is that...

25:21.690 --> 25:24.110
I'm not the shooter, okay?

25:24.110 --> 25:25.440
I haven't hurt anyone.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.053
- Because we have your gun.
- I have his gun.

25:29.090 --> 25:31.200
- You fucking idiots, the real shooter

25:31.200 --> 25:32.140
is right fucking out there,

25:32.140 --> 25:32.973
you think you caught him?

25:32.973 --> 25:34.653
Oh my, we're gonna fuckin' die.

25:41.950 --> 25:44.330
- We can tie him up
until the police arrive.

25:44.330 --> 25:45.930
- [Dale] What a great idea.

25:45.930 --> 25:46.763
- Do it.

25:47.998 --> 25:50.811
- With what? Fucking Kleenex?

25:50.811 --> 25:52.343
- Trash bags, use a trash bag.

25:54.500 --> 25:55.450
- There aren't any.

25:59.049 --> 26:01.560
- I saw a janitor's cart
right outside the door.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.460
- That could work.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.773
- Then go.

26:07.108 --> 26:09.607
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

26:09.607 --> 26:10.483
- Are you scared?

26:11.608 --> 26:13.060
- Of what?

26:13.060 --> 26:14.300
- The real shooter

26:14.300 --> 26:15.600
- I'm very open to the possibility

26:15.600 --> 26:17.330
that there could be two shooters.

26:17.330 --> 26:18.163
- I'll go.

26:19.450 --> 26:20.283
- Wait.

26:26.020 --> 26:26.853
Okay.

26:32.420 --> 26:35.410
- If you hear any gunshots...

26:39.630 --> 26:40.883
- We'll call the cops.

26:48.058 --> 26:50.808
(chair scraping)

27:10.020 --> 27:11.893
- The cart was right outside.

27:13.367 --> 27:15.360
- What's taking so fucking long.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.860
- Maybe you should go get her.

27:17.970 --> 27:18.853
- Renee!

27:25.324 --> 27:26.157
- Renee!

27:28.135 --> 27:28.968
- Renee!

27:51.456 --> 27:53.706
What did you see out there?

27:57.460 --> 27:59.943
- I couldn't find the trash bags.

28:02.350 --> 28:04.427
And this chair isn't keeping anyone out.

28:13.940 --> 28:14.773
- Do it.

28:18.410 --> 28:19.243
In the stall.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.303
Get up.

28:24.770 --> 28:27.710
Get up, I will fucking
shoot you in the head.

28:27.710 --> 28:28.723
- Okay, okay.

28:46.814 --> 28:48.660
Get down on the toilet.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.333
Get down on the toilet!

28:51.487 --> 28:52.320
(blow lands)

28:52.320 --> 28:53.760
- Do what she says.

28:53.760 --> 28:56.483
- Oh, fuck.

28:57.430 --> 28:58.263
- Tie his hands.

29:02.223 --> 29:07.110
(Dale groaning)
- Oh, fuck.

29:07.110 --> 29:09.313
- Hurry up.
- All right.

29:11.063 --> 29:12.210
- What is your plan?

29:12.210 --> 29:14.880
- Tie his feet.
- Okay, all right.

29:16.210 --> 29:18.253
- We should be formulating a plan,

29:19.232 --> 29:21.580
we should be in constant
contact with the police.

29:21.580 --> 29:23.650
You should not be tying
up the only motherfucker

29:23.650 --> 29:25.200
that knows how to use that gun.

29:29.313 --> 29:30.383
- Why'd you bring it?

29:31.400 --> 29:32.730
- I always carry it.

29:32.730 --> 29:34.300
- Fuck off with that.

29:34.300 --> 29:36.963
Who brings a loaded gun
to a former workplace?

29:38.530 --> 29:41.150
- I have a concealed carry permit

29:41.150 --> 29:43.923
in my fucking pocket right fucking here.

29:53.420 --> 29:54.380
- I thought the whole point of this

29:54.380 --> 29:55.833
was to be able to shoot back.

29:57.940 --> 30:00.310
- Everybody's a hero at a gun range.

30:00.310 --> 30:05.133
He has an AK, that is a
Beretta, I was outgunned.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.890
I'm not stepping in to that shit.

30:16.924 --> 30:19.825
- Well, it's about fucking time.

30:19.825 --> 30:23.575
(helicopter blades whirring)

30:28.968 --> 30:29.807
How long do you think it'll take for 'em

30:29.807 --> 30:31.808
to get in the building?

30:31.808 --> 30:33.400
- [Dale] Depends, if the
shooter is (indistinct)

30:33.400 --> 30:34.233
on this floor.

30:40.867 --> 30:43.450
(phone buzzes)

30:44.736 --> 30:45.873
- She's okay.

30:55.450 --> 30:58.363
- Did she see the shooter?
Is it an employee?

31:00.240 --> 31:02.330
- She didn't see his face.

31:02.330 --> 31:03.480
- Show me what it says.

31:05.638 --> 31:06.471
- Cat!

31:37.283 --> 31:38.443
- Is that bleach?

31:39.490 --> 31:40.323
Fuck!

31:41.510 --> 31:43.540
- You you really know a
lot about guns, don't you?

31:43.540 --> 31:45.080
- What the fuck?

31:45.080 --> 31:47.140
- How'd you know that was an AK?

31:47.140 --> 31:49.150
- It's a common rifle,
you can tell by the burst,

31:49.150 --> 31:50.810
the fucking sound.

31:50.810 --> 31:52.330
- I know you're part of this.

31:52.330 --> 31:54.230
- I don't want to kill anybody, okay?

31:54.230 --> 31:55.393
I'm not a murderer.

31:58.064 --> 31:59.114
- Fuck you. Fuck you!

32:03.950 --> 32:06.880
Oh God, just let me go, okay?

32:06.880 --> 32:09.650
I will lead the police up here.

32:09.650 --> 32:12.660
They're surrounding the
building as we speak.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.550
- Right, you want me to believe

32:14.550 --> 32:16.627
that you're just gonna stroll out of here

32:16.627 --> 32:20.543
and get help for us with an
active shooter on the loose.

32:21.710 --> 32:25.160
- Please, I know he's out there, okay?

32:25.160 --> 32:27.110
Let me help fix this.

32:27.110 --> 32:29.860
- We haven't heard any shots
since you've been in here.

32:31.040 --> 32:34.650
- Yeah, because he took hostages probably.

32:34.650 --> 32:38.233
- Or he's being held hostage.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.093
- Fuck you!

32:58.570 --> 33:00.610
- Put the gun down, Cat.

33:00.610 --> 33:02.360
- It has your attention doesn't it?

33:05.260 --> 33:07.960
So we're not gonna talk about
those text messages now?

33:09.740 --> 33:12.383
- Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

33:14.940 --> 33:17.750
This is not a good time
to be talking about us.

33:17.750 --> 33:20.103
- When is a better time?

33:21.520 --> 33:25.230
- Let's just get through this.

33:25.230 --> 33:27.530
- We could fucking die here.

33:27.530 --> 33:29.020
- Yeah, we're gonna die if you keep waving

33:29.020 --> 33:30.320
that thing around in here.

33:35.480 --> 33:36.930
- If you put your phone down.

33:50.683 --> 33:53.266
(phone buzzes)

33:57.701 --> 33:59.293
Are you gonna get that?

34:05.130 --> 34:07.727
- This is more important right now.

34:32.100 --> 34:33.010
- If he comes in here,

34:33.010 --> 34:35.610
you really think she's
capable of handling that gun.

34:37.730 --> 34:38.563
- Then who?

34:39.790 --> 34:41.573
- If not me, fucking you.

34:43.100 --> 34:45.410
She's gonna misfire that
thing, kill one of us,

34:45.410 --> 34:47.103
and draw some unwanted attention.

34:48.060 --> 34:50.023
She doesn't know what
the fuck she's doing.

34:51.178 --> 34:53.100
- You're not wrong there.

34:53.100 --> 34:54.870
- Why don't you do something about it?

34:54.870 --> 34:56.551
- You're as dumb as you look.

34:56.551 --> 34:58.123
You think you can turn
us against each other?

34:59.100 --> 35:02.093
I think you're afraid that I
might know too much about you.

35:04.253 --> 35:07.290
- I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, lady.

35:07.290 --> 35:10.140
- I know you're not supposed
to be in the building today.

35:11.960 --> 35:13.803
The paychecks were mailed out.

35:14.714 --> 35:16.480
I signed them.

35:25.700 --> 35:27.100
- You're behind the layoffs?

35:29.300 --> 35:30.650
- Now do you wanna kill me?

35:38.466 --> 35:40.442
(spits)

35:40.442 --> 35:41.692
Son of a bitch!

35:57.900 --> 36:00.021
- Don't even think about it.

36:00.021 --> 36:05.021
- Okay. You're, you're still
mad, that's, that's fair.

36:06.090 --> 36:08.393
Did you two work things out?

36:10.020 --> 36:11.470
- We're all on the same side.

36:15.844 --> 36:18.261
- Look, I get it, we're safe.

36:20.294 --> 36:22.200
We have got our guy.

36:22.200 --> 36:25.090
- [Dale] I'm not the fucking shooter.

36:25.090 --> 36:25.980
- Keep it down.

36:28.417 --> 36:29.250
Okay?

36:31.835 --> 36:34.418
(phone buzzes)

36:46.080 --> 36:49.620
Okay, let's, uh, let's call 911 again.

36:49.620 --> 36:50.530
- I already did.

36:50.530 --> 36:52.270
- Call them again, tell them where we are

36:52.270 --> 36:53.870
and that we have the shooter.

36:53.870 --> 36:55.720
- [Dale] I'm not the fucking shooter.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.143
- Shut up.

37:05.700 --> 37:08.990
Tell them we have one of the shooters.

37:08.990 --> 37:09.823
Is that better?

37:10.747 --> 37:12.843
- (indistinct) and
torturing an innocent man?

37:18.062 --> 37:19.603
- You wanna go another round?

37:22.750 --> 37:25.170
- I didn't fire that
weapon. Check the magazine.

37:25.170 --> 37:26.690
- [Juliette] The what?

37:26.690 --> 37:27.630
- The magazine.

37:27.630 --> 37:29.690
- The magazine in the gun.

37:29.690 --> 37:32.140
It can tell us whether
he's fired the gun or not.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.700
- Do you know what she's talking about?

37:35.700 --> 37:37.160
- I'm trying to help you.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.747
- Yes, of course. I know
what she's talking about.

37:39.747 --> 37:41.423
Tell her.
- I heard.

37:42.905 --> 37:45.910
What's the magazine?
- Oh, for God's sake.

37:45.910 --> 37:48.190
- You hit the release on the handle.

37:48.190 --> 37:49.740
Right there by your thumb, yes.

37:51.317 --> 37:52.170
For the love of Christ,

37:52.170 --> 37:54.220
take your finger off the goddamn trigger.

37:59.488 --> 38:01.883
(magazine clatters)

38:01.883 --> 38:03.550
We're all gonna die.

38:08.873 --> 38:11.523
Here comes the hard part,
you're gonna have to count.

38:14.804 --> 38:16.440
- How many are there?

38:16.440 --> 38:18.540
- How many are there supposed to be?

38:18.540 --> 38:20.710
- Some have 10 I think.
- 15

38:22.500 --> 38:24.070
- What are you gonna
do? I have the bullets.

38:24.070 --> 38:25.970
- Give them to me.
- Fuck you, no way.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.610
No, fuck you.
- Okay. Okay.

38:27.610 --> 38:29.960
- Careful, okay? There's
still one in the chamber.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.130
- She has the bullets.

38:32.130 --> 38:34.830
- It automatically feeds
bullets into the chamber

38:34.830 --> 38:35.680
when it's loaded.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.260
- He's saying it's loaded.
- Is it?

38:40.260 --> 38:41.440
- Oh my God, you don't know

38:41.440 --> 38:43.267
the first fucking thing about guns.

38:43.267 --> 38:44.403
- No, I don't.

38:45.897 --> 38:47.380
- None of your boyfriend's
ever taught you this?

38:47.380 --> 38:51.099
You never took a gun safety
class or went to a range?

38:51.099 --> 38:53.150
(Juliette scoffs)

38:53.150 --> 38:55.540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold
on, hold on, hold on.

38:55.540 --> 38:57.840
Check the chamber, you'll
find the last round.

38:59.499 --> 39:01.325
- I don't see anything.

39:01.325 --> 39:03.150
- Pull the slide back.

39:03.150 --> 39:05.650
- I think I have a better way

39:05.650 --> 39:08.643
of finding out if you're lying.

39:13.321 --> 39:15.571
- You're a fucking lunatic.

39:17.350 --> 39:19.672
- Juls.
- Stop it!

39:19.672 --> 39:21.872
- You are not running
things now, Cat! I am.

39:23.340 --> 39:24.650
He's a part of this.

39:25.701 --> 39:28.050
- No, no, think about it, okay?

39:28.050 --> 39:30.678
The shots you heard, fully automatic.

39:30.678 --> 39:32.350
(mimics automatic firing)

39:32.350 --> 39:33.900
That's a semi automatic pistol.

39:34.970 --> 39:36.227
- Listen to him, Juls.

39:38.011 --> 39:39.011
- Tell them.

39:40.445 --> 39:43.923
Tell them you're part of
this, that you're involved.

39:46.220 --> 39:48.970
- I'm just here to pick up my check.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.493
- Fuck off with that.

39:53.059 --> 39:57.399
You've worked in security for three years

39:57.399 --> 39:59.943
and you don't know where accounting is?

40:04.004 --> 40:06.503
- You're not gonna force
a confession out of me.

40:10.233 --> 40:15.233
- Oh, really?

40:24.987 --> 40:27.570
(phone buzzes)

40:31.080 --> 40:32.813
- Stop, stop, stop, it's not him.

40:33.818 --> 40:37.866
(gun fires)
(Cat screams)

40:37.866 --> 40:40.533
(Dale groaning)

40:43.892 --> 40:44.892
- Oh my God.

40:47.068 --> 40:49.235
(panting)

40:51.021 --> 40:51.854
Oh God.

40:52.899 --> 40:55.030
- What did you do?

40:55.030 --> 40:56.770
- I didn't mean to shoot.

40:56.770 --> 40:57.820
I wasn't gonna shoot.

41:01.202 --> 41:04.573
- (indistinct) fuck, fuck!

41:10.440 --> 41:12.400
- I was just defending myself.

41:14.929 --> 41:19.929
- (crying) Help me, help me!

41:22.727 --> 41:23.858
Help!

41:23.858 --> 41:26.191
(gun fires)

41:33.507 --> 41:35.762
You gotta get me outta here.

41:35.762 --> 41:38.027
- We can't do that right now.

41:38.027 --> 41:41.494
- I keep bleeding out
like this, I'm gonna die.

41:41.494 --> 41:45.452
- Can you hold on a little bit longer?

41:45.452 --> 41:47.615
- Where are those fucking cops?

41:47.615 --> 41:48.670
- It sounds like they're
trying to talk to the shooter

41:48.670 --> 41:50.198
from the outside.

41:50.198 --> 41:52.710
- Fucking call, call the
SWAT, I don't fucking care.

41:52.710 --> 41:54.880
I don't wanna die in
this fucking bathroom.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.145
- Even if we call them, they're
not gonna pick up the pace

41:57.145 --> 41:58.880
for one wounded.

42:00.590 --> 42:01.423
What?

42:03.133 --> 42:07.700
- At least we know where they fucking are.

42:07.700 --> 42:10.780
- Look, we just, we just need

42:10.780 --> 42:12.390
to get our story straight here.

42:12.390 --> 42:13.640
We're not going anywhere.

42:14.602 --> 42:19.202
- You shot him, unarmed, tied up.

42:19.202 --> 42:21.870
You did that.
- He got free.

42:21.870 --> 42:24.400
You know if I were you,
I would be more worried

42:24.400 --> 42:26.048
about helping him from bleeding out

42:26.048 --> 42:28.693
than what your story is gonna be.

42:31.474 --> 42:34.969
- You're gonna wait out the clock on me.

42:34.969 --> 42:38.940
Please, please, don't do this.

42:38.940 --> 42:40.530
Please, I'll tell them the shooter,

42:40.530 --> 42:43.710
I'll tell them the shooter guy, please.

42:43.710 --> 42:45.043
Fuck.

42:45.043 --> 42:46.753
- There's not much more
we can do right now.

42:50.740 --> 42:51.573
- Just shut up.

42:53.383 --> 42:54.973
- Help me get to the fucking toilet.

42:57.206 --> 43:01.183
- It wouldn't kill you to
have a little dignity, Juls.

43:01.183 --> 43:03.766
(Dale panting)

43:05.447 --> 43:06.280
- Okay.

43:27.804 --> 43:30.471
(Dale groaning)

43:31.448 --> 43:34.031
(Dale panting)

44:27.050 --> 44:28.133
- Okay, okay!

44:28.970 --> 44:31.340
He came in, he came in like this,

44:31.340 --> 44:35.920
and you were here and then
Catalina was there, right?

44:35.920 --> 44:37.620
- I'm not gonna lie for you, Juls.

44:38.466 --> 44:39.840
- We have to start taking
care of each other.

44:39.840 --> 44:40.743
If not now, when?

44:41.850 --> 44:44.020
- This isn't office politics.

44:44.020 --> 44:46.180
This is a man's life we're talking about.

44:46.180 --> 44:47.230
- It's our lives too.

44:49.770 --> 44:51.563
- There's still a shooter out there.

44:56.240 --> 44:57.073
- Hey.

44:58.300 --> 45:00.100
- Do you want me to leave you alone?

45:03.700 --> 45:04.533
- No.

45:08.740 --> 45:11.990
I need you to get that
gun, and those bullets.

45:17.426 --> 45:19.259
I need you to kill me.

45:21.867 --> 45:23.473
- You know I can't.

45:25.390 --> 45:27.180
- Fuck, it hurt so bad.

45:27.180 --> 45:29.153
- Just hold on a little longer, okay?

45:33.454 --> 45:36.037
(Dale panting)

45:38.789 --> 45:40.330
- If you don't do it, I'm gonna bleed out

45:40.330 --> 45:41.923
like a fucking animal.

45:47.116 --> 45:47.949
- I can't.

45:57.381 --> 46:01.130
- I was supposed to be a part of this.

46:01.130 --> 46:01.963
Today.

46:11.434 --> 46:13.934
I couldn't go through with it.

46:17.196 --> 46:18.663
I wasn't here to pick up a check.

46:23.070 --> 46:25.143
- What the fuck did you just say?

46:27.060 --> 46:30.183
- Fucking kill me, please.

46:32.800 --> 46:34.593
- Why are you doing this?

46:37.720 --> 46:39.520
- It wasn't supposed to go this far.

46:45.100 --> 46:46.433
- Who is out there?

46:51.135 --> 46:52.848
- They heard that shot,

46:52.848 --> 46:53.681
he's gonna be coming to find me.

46:58.146 --> 46:58.979
- Cat?

47:00.706 --> 47:03.360
(gun clicks)

47:03.360 --> 47:06.253
(Dale suffocating)

47:06.253 --> 47:08.670
- We were still talking here.

47:16.399 --> 47:18.524
- We are still talking.

47:18.524 --> 47:20.357
- We're still talking.

47:21.780 --> 47:23.313
Shut the fuck up.

47:25.979 --> 47:27.800
What the fuck are you doing?

47:27.800 --> 47:29.910
- Give me the gun.
- Why?

47:29.910 --> 47:31.710
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

47:31.710 --> 47:32.640
- Stop!

47:32.640 --> 47:35.247
- He's with the shooter!

47:35.247 --> 47:37.002
(Dale grunting)

47:37.002 --> 47:38.597
- Then just let him die.
- Help me.

47:39.875 --> 47:42.792
(Juliette shrieks)

47:44.140 --> 47:47.057
(Dale suffocating)

47:51.408 --> 47:53.825
(neck snaps)

48:00.070 --> 48:03.570
(body plops on the floor)

48:11.482 --> 48:14.399
(Catalina sobbing)

49:03.364 --> 49:06.614
(light dramatic music)

51:55.970 --> 51:57.783
- Okay, okay.

52:03.550 --> 52:04.383
Came in.

52:05.350 --> 52:07.950
He came in violently.

52:07.950 --> 52:09.393
He burst in here.

52:11.160 --> 52:13.373
And he scared us, we were scared already.

52:15.930 --> 52:17.910
And he was creepy looking.

52:17.910 --> 52:19.713
No, no.

52:21.060 --> 52:24.190
We let him in, Renee, you knew him.

52:25.657 --> 52:28.060
We let him in, Renee knew him,

52:28.060 --> 52:29.200
we thought we could trust him.

52:29.200 --> 52:30.743
He worked in security.

52:34.610 --> 52:35.810
And then it got violent.

52:36.872 --> 52:38.222
When we saw he had a gun...

52:40.500 --> 52:43.263
And, we just,

52:44.880 --> 52:47.099
we had to defend ourselves.

52:47.099 --> 52:49.710
We were defending ourselves.

52:49.710 --> 52:51.573
- We don't need a fucking alibi.

52:52.934 --> 52:57.934
He was with the shooter, we
didn't do anything wrong (sobs).

53:31.060 --> 53:34.010
We need to figure out a plan
if the other shooter comes in.

53:36.280 --> 53:37.323
- We shoot him.

53:42.720 --> 53:43.553
We'll shoot him.

53:48.752 --> 53:51.419
(Renee sobbing)

54:32.681 --> 54:35.764
- I think they cut the power.
- Yeah.

54:36.840 --> 54:39.067
That means they should be here soon.

54:47.915 --> 54:50.665
(glass breaking)

54:59.044 --> 55:01.794
(drier whirring)

55:16.688 --> 55:19.105
(gun firing)

55:31.596 --> 55:34.179
(door banging)

56:37.154 --> 56:39.987
(shooter wailing)

57:38.718 --> 57:41.135
(gun clicks)

57:49.193 --> 57:50.618
- No.

57:50.618 --> 57:53.035
(gun clicks)

58:15.609 --> 58:17.950
- No! (screams)

58:17.950 --> 58:19.816
(gun firing)

58:19.816 --> 58:22.899
(bullets clattering)

58:24.361 --> 58:27.611
(high pitched buzzing)

59:12.335 --> 59:15.168
(shooter wailing)

1:02:34.674 --> 1:02:38.446
(gun fires)
(body falls)

1:02:38.446 --> 1:02:41.613
(gun fires severally)

1:03:49.977 --> 1:03:52.810
(water splashing)

1:03:58.415 --> 1:04:01.082
(Renee panting)

1:06:56.311 --> 1:06:59.394
(instrumental music)
