00:02.503 --> 00:04.036
in a body bag.
- Yeah, it's gonna be you.

00:04.138 --> 00:05.304
- FATIMA: Previously on Sistas.

00:05.406 --> 00:07.473
- Mother -- you just
pushed in my apartment.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.441
Huh?
What kinda cop does that shit?

00:09.543 --> 00:11.377
- I'm really trying to
help these kids.

00:11.479 --> 00:14.747
- So, did anything interesting
happen last night?

00:14.849 --> 00:18.150
- Oh my god, girl, we just sat
and we taught each other

00:18.252 --> 00:23.555
how to apply mink lashes
and did crochet braids.

00:23.657 --> 00:27.326
- Well, that's good, right?
- Bitch, I'm being sarcastic!

00:27.428 --> 00:29.528
- Don't come back here again.
- I hear you.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.330
- KAREN: Mmhm, you better
do more than hear me.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.165
- Imma find out who she is.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.167
- I invested like 19k
to a stock.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.036
Right now, it's about
at like 1.5.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.337
- Damn.
- I guess,

00:38.439 --> 00:40.105
I'm just lucky like you say.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.940
- Nothing shocks or
upsets you, though.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.642
- Life is what you
make it, right?

00:43.744 --> 00:45.377
- I'm pregnant.

00:47.314 --> 00:50.349
- Did you hear me?

00:50.451 --> 00:51.950
I said I'm pregnant.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.754
- Okay.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.992
- Is that all you have to say?

01:02.329 --> 01:04.496
- How far along are you?

01:04.598 --> 01:09.735
- It's very early and I haven't
even been to the doctor yet.

01:09.837 --> 01:13.005
- Okay.

01:13.107 --> 01:16.442
- You have to say something
other than "okay".

01:16.544 --> 01:18.877
- I'm sorry, I'm just
doing some math.

01:18.979 --> 01:20.679
That's all.

01:27.888 --> 01:31.190
- It's not yours.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.858
- Are you sure?

01:36.297 --> 01:39.131
Really, Karen?

01:39.233 --> 01:41.033
- It's not.
I'm sorry.

01:47.208 --> 01:51.643
- [sighs]
So you think it's Zac's.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.446
- It is.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.916
- Okay, but isn't it too tight
of a window to tell?

01:58.018 --> 02:00.819
- Okay, Aaron, this is
not your baby, okay?

02:00.921 --> 02:03.255
I am sorry, it's--
- How do you know that?

02:03.357 --> 02:05.691
- It's Zac's.
I know, I'm sho' of it.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.759
- You don't even know
how far along you are.

02:07.862 --> 02:10.696
- Okay.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.364
- Is it that you're
actually sure

02:12.466 --> 02:14.500
or you just don't want
it to be my baby?

02:14.602 --> 02:16.034
- I'm sho' of it.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.641
- Nah, nah, I think
that's just your way

02:22.743 --> 02:24.176
of staying connected
to Zac.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.611
- No, he's moved on.

02:25.713 --> 02:28.413
- Have you?
- Okay, you know what, Aaron?

02:28.516 --> 02:30.449
I, um, was just telling
you this--

02:30.551 --> 02:32.784
- What, why?
- So, that you could, you know.

02:32.887 --> 02:35.220
- What?
- Stop pursuing me.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.590
- Wait, hold on.

02:38.692 --> 02:42.494
You think you being pregnant's
gonna make me stop?

02:42.596 --> 02:45.797
Karen, have you not
being paying attention?

02:45.900 --> 02:47.399
I love you.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.301
And I will love this baby.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.903
- God.
- Especially if it's mine.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.604
- It's not.

02:52.706 --> 02:56.241
It's not yours.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.876
- Whether it's mine or not.

02:57.978 --> 03:01.780
- Would you just stop saying
the shit I want to hear, please?

03:01.882 --> 03:03.582
Oh my God.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.754
[sighs]

03:08.856 --> 03:13.258
- Look, I'm not trying
to upset you. Okay?

03:13.360 --> 03:17.829
I'm, I'm just telling
you how I feel.

03:17.932 --> 03:19.364
- I know.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.633
I know, I'm sorry.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.569
- And I hear you, Karen.
Okay? I do.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.270
I'm just not convinced.

03:25.372 --> 03:29.875
- Can we just
take a minute?

03:29.977 --> 03:34.079
Some time...
to figure this all out?

03:36.317 --> 03:40.252
- Okay.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.820
- I think...

03:44.858 --> 03:48.894
I think I need to be...
single.

03:51.699 --> 03:57.002
For a while and just--and
get ready for this baby.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.610
- You're not over him.

04:08.148 --> 04:10.349
- No.

04:10.451 --> 04:13.018
I'm not.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.421
- Okay.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.090
[sighs]

04:18.192 --> 04:21.260
And I know now that he's doing
well, it just makes it harder.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.161
- It's so much more than that.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.963
- Okay, then what is it?

04:27.101 --> 04:29.901
- How do you know
that he's doing well?

04:30.004 --> 04:33.372
- I saw him roll up to
the basketball court.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.340
- Oh.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.777
Okay, well...

04:38.879 --> 04:40.712
We have three
years of history

04:40.814 --> 04:43.682
and that can't just
be wiped away.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.917
I'm sorry.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.850

I need space.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.831
I hope you can respect that.

- Okay, alright, alright.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.659
That's enough.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.394
- No, no, no, look.

Every time I say something,
I feel like I bore her.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.332
Like, I don't know what to do.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.268

you're gonna have to talk

08:56.370 --> 08:58.069
to Danni about.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.704

what that was.

31:52.361 --> 31:54.461
I tried.

31:54.563 --> 32:00.000

I'm asking you to take me
by the hand and show me.

It's not.

If you wanted this
to work, you would.

32:30.699 --> 32:32.532
