00:05.372 --> 00:07.907
{\an7}Listen, everybody's
saying everything, fam.

00:07.974 --> 00:09.175
{\an7}They just ain't
saying it to you.

00:09.242 --> 00:10.777
{\an8}What they saying?

00:10.844 --> 00:13.580
{\an7}They saying
they (bleep) your girl, fam.

00:13.646 --> 00:16.116
{\an8}I stand here
in the pursuit of justice,

00:16.181 --> 00:19.219
{\an8}not just for myself
but for any other woman

00:19.285 --> 00:20.954
{\an8}who has been exploited
by a man.

00:21.020 --> 00:23.690
{\an7}Did you leak the tape
of Teairra?

00:23.757 --> 00:25.058
{\an8}I did not do that.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.192
{\an8}How did it go down?

00:26.259 --> 00:27.527
{\an8}Like, what happened?

00:27.594 --> 00:29.362
{\an8}I wanted to introduce her
to multiple women.

00:29.429 --> 00:30.964
{\an8}I wanna know
if you was open to it,

00:31.030 --> 00:33.299
{\an8}so, you know, I also checked
your little pictures out too.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.301
{\an7}So you're more beautiful in
person, that's all I'm saying.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.237
{\an7}You're a smooth talker,
that's why you're in trouble.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.672
{\an8}No, no, no...
(laughing)

00:39.739 --> 00:41.341
{\an7}(Shun)
I see something in you.

00:41.408 --> 00:44.110
{\an7}I want to make some money
with you.

00:44.177 --> 00:47.447
{\an8}Well, you seem like a person
that, you know, can guide me.

00:47.514 --> 00:50.884
{\an8}Donatella put
this whole thing together.

00:50.950 --> 00:52.619
{\an8}We're going overseas.

00:50.950 --> 00:52.619
{\an9}Yes.

00:52.685 --> 00:53.620
{\an8}We're going to London.

00:53.686 --> 00:54.788
{\an7}Yes, we've got
so much going on.

00:54.854 --> 00:58.057
{\an8}I want it to be
a ladies' trip.

00:58.124 --> 01:00.226
{\an8}What's wild is you ain't
never bobbed your head

01:00.293 --> 01:02.729
{\an8}to, like, a us collab.

01:00.293 --> 01:02.729
{\an7}A record?

01:02.796 --> 01:03.963
{\an8}You've been talking
about it for years.

01:04.030 --> 01:05.397
{\an7}I got your back all the way
around the board.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.634
{\an8}♪♪

01:07.700 --> 01:10.170
{\an7}I have a woman here
who has, uh, collapsed.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.238
{\an7}Well, just lay her down flat,
no eating or drinking.

01:12.305 --> 01:13.673
{\an8}What the (bleep)?

01:13.740 --> 01:15.108
{\an8}(Roccstar)
Do you believe
that bull(bleep)?

01:15.175 --> 01:17.110
{\an7}(Brooke)
You told her to go in there
and hit an octave.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.179
{\an8}Panic attack.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.179
{\an8}What are we gonna do?

01:19.245 --> 01:20.713
{\an8}Unless you wanna
jump in the booth.

Bridget says she wanna
kick off this London trip

02:08.094 --> 02:11.030
by grabbing a pint in Hollywood
with Donatella.

02:11.097 --> 02:12.899
{\an8}But I wanna get there
before the rest of the girls

02:12.966 --> 02:15.602
{\an8}and tell Bridget why Moniece
might not be making it

02:15.668 --> 02:17.670
{\an8}with the rest of us to London.

02:17.737 --> 02:20.607
{\an1}Oh, my gosh, this London trip
is about to be so great.

02:20.673 --> 02:21.941
{\an5}Are you excited?

02:20.673 --> 02:21.941
{\an3}I am.

02:22.008 --> 02:23.743
{\an5}Damn straight with that!

02:22.008 --> 02:23.743
Darling...

02:23.810 --> 02:26.312
{\an4}I mean, unless you stripping
on the weekend.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.312
It's the middle of the day.

02:26.379 --> 02:28.014
{\an4}Hi!

02:26.379 --> 02:28.014
Muah-muah.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.649
See, this is
what I came here for.

02:29.716 --> 02:31.484
What's up?

02:31.551 --> 02:32.619
Hey, beautiful.

02:32.685 --> 02:34.053
{\an8}I've been just
telling Donatella

02:34.120 --> 02:35.455
{\an7}that I'm excited about
this girls' trip to London.

02:35.522 --> 02:36.990
Y'all wasn't gossiping
about something, 'cause...

02:37.056 --> 02:38.858
{\an4}No, we was waiting on you
for that, baby girl.

02:37.056 --> 02:38.858
{\an3}Oh, God...

02:38.925 --> 02:41.027
{\an5}Had to wait for Brooke.

02:38.925 --> 02:41.027
Couldn't have tea
without you, baby.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.295
{\an4}Okay?

02:41.094 --> 02:42.295
Well, before y'all sip...

02:42.362 --> 02:43.930
{\an7}Listen.
Y'all not gonna believe this.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.565
What you do?

02:45.632 --> 02:46.966
What happened?

02:47.033 --> 02:49.769
{\an1}I go to Moniece session
with Roccstar.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.371
She in there singing,
doing her little thing.

02:51.437 --> 02:53.473
She seemed like she was
a little shy about it,

02:53.540 --> 02:55.675
{\an1}but Roccstar extra, right?
So he was like,

02:55.742 --> 02:57.577
"Yeah, Moniece, go in the booth
and do that!"

02:57.644 --> 02:59.145
{\an1}She never made it
to the booth.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.380
I peek out and Moniece

03:00.446 --> 03:01.881
was, like, laid on the floor--

03:01.948 --> 03:03.716
{\an5}What?

03:01.948 --> 03:03.716
{\an6}What?

03:01.948 --> 03:03.716
--in the walkway of the studio.

03:03.783 --> 03:05.285
Girl went to the hospital.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.787
We called 911 and everything.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.455
{\an1}I think she was like,
"Listen...

03:09.522 --> 03:11.691
This ain't going the way
I thought it was gonna go."

03:11.758 --> 03:12.825
"So I'm gonna pass out."

03:12.892 --> 03:15.094
You think she did it
on purpose?

03:15.161 --> 03:17.297
(slurping,
Bridget and Donatella chuckle)

03:17.363 --> 03:21.968
{\an5}Dang, lady...

03:17.363 --> 03:21.968
Whoa... that's crazy timing.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.604
{\an6}Moniece!

03:22.035 --> 03:24.604
{\an5}Muah.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.604
Hi, my love.

03:24.671 --> 03:25.972
We were just talking
about you.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.907
{\an5}Oh, were you now?

03:26.039 --> 03:27.907
Are you all right?

03:27.974 --> 03:29.909
{\an5}Yes, I'm feeling better.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.909
Well, what's going on?

03:29.976 --> 03:32.178
So, I was, um,
taking a medication

03:32.245 --> 03:34.747
{\an7}and they upped it
from 50 to 100

03:34.814 --> 03:37.150
literally the night
before the session.

03:37.216 --> 03:39.118
(Brooke)
Last time I saw Moniece,

03:39.185 --> 03:41.087
she was on the floor,
holding on to her wig.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.456
Now she got a passport
in her hand or in her purse,

03:43.523 --> 03:45.258
ready to go to London.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.327
But that's none of my business.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.462
So they gave me two liters
of fluids, they took

03:49.529 --> 03:50.763
a lot of blood work.

03:50.830 --> 03:53.199
{\an1}So everything came back
okay, so...

03:53.266 --> 03:55.435
{\an5}I've been cleared
for travel.

03:53.266 --> 03:55.435
{\an3}Yay!

03:55.501 --> 03:56.436
I'm gonna be there.

03:56.502 --> 03:57.537
I'm just happy you're okay.

03:57.604 --> 03:58.838
{\an4}Thank you.

03:57.604 --> 03:58.838
I was a little worried.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.239
'Cause this trip is
gonna be a lot of fun.

04:00.306 --> 04:02.342
{\an1}We got a lot of good
activities lined up for us.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.243
I extended the invite
to Paris.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.346
{\an4}She mentioned she might
invite La'Britney, 'cause
she didn't feel like

04:06.412 --> 04:08.014
La'Britney had a lot
of friends out here

04:08.081 --> 04:09.349
and she wanted
to include her

04:09.415 --> 04:10.450
{\an1}and I don't know
that's confirmed but...

04:10.516 --> 04:11.417
I love La'Britney.
That's my dawg.

04:11.484 --> 04:12.418
(Moniece)
La'Britney's

04:12.485 --> 04:13.886
coming on this trip?

04:13.953 --> 04:15.755
This is the same girl
that I heard was getting busy

04:15.822 --> 04:16.956
with someone else's husband,

04:17.023 --> 04:18.725
and now there's Paris,
who, by the way,

04:18.791 --> 04:21.226
is the same person who dropped
a pin for Princess

04:21.293 --> 04:23.096
to ambush A.D.'s fashion show.

04:23.162 --> 04:26.733
I am, oh, so very delighted to
be going to a different country

04:26.799 --> 04:28.267
with these two bitches.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.303
{\an5}Speaking of invite...

04:28.334 --> 04:30.303
{\an3}Yes?

04:30.370 --> 04:34.073
{\an4}Brooke and I met with, um,
Miss Teairra Marie--

04:30.370 --> 04:34.073
{\an3}Okay.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.643
{\an5}--post, you know,
press conference--

04:34.140 --> 04:36.643
{\an3}Yeah.

04:36.709 --> 04:40.780
{\an5}--and we convinced her to come.

04:36.709 --> 04:40.780
That's great.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.016
{\an5}London gang...

04:40.847 --> 04:43.016
Oh... hey...

04:43.082 --> 04:44.250
{\an3}(Donatella)
Hey, girl.

04:44.317 --> 04:47.787
{\an4}(Paris)
Hi, Brooke.
Donatella, what's up?

04:47.854 --> 04:49.589
Hello, Moniece.
I'm La'Britney.

04:49.656 --> 04:51.791
Nice to officially
meet you.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.326
{\an4}We were just talking
about you.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.326
Were you?

04:53.393 --> 04:55.128
So you're coming to London.

04:55.194 --> 04:57.630
{\an9}Yes.

04:55.194 --> 04:57.630
{\an8}Yes, I'm coming to London.

04:57.697 --> 04:58.798
{\an5}Yes!

04:57.697 --> 04:58.798
{\an3}Whoo-whoo!

04:58.865 --> 05:00.733
{\an1}I thought you were
performing this weekend

05:00.800 --> 05:02.435
at my friend's showcase.

05:02.502 --> 05:05.204
Oh, no,
I have business in London.

05:05.271 --> 05:07.340
{\an1}I'm actually releasing
a remix to "Actin' Funny"

05:07.407 --> 05:09.142
featuring Lady LeShurr.

05:09.208 --> 05:11.644
She's a rapper--
shout out to Donatella.

05:11.711 --> 05:14.113
{\an5}(La'Britney)
I chose to go to London
over the gay pride event

05:14.180 --> 05:16.883
because I feel like getting
more exposure over in the UK

05:16.949 --> 05:18.418
is better for my career.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.319
But that rat JayWill told me

05:20.386 --> 05:22.088
that Moniece
was spreading rumors

05:22.155 --> 05:24.657
about me sleeping with A1
for tracks?

05:24.724 --> 05:29.328
If this girl's not careful,
she and I gon' have some smoke.

05:29.395 --> 05:31.531
{\an7}Okay, so Nikki,
she's not here right now,

05:31.597 --> 05:33.332
{\an7}but I invited her
to come to London as well.

05:33.399 --> 05:34.667
(Bridget laughing)

05:34.734 --> 05:36.369
{\an5}(Paris)
This is a really random
group of girls.

05:36.436 --> 05:40.239
Some of us are friends and
some of us are... uh, whatever.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.341
Who knows how this trip
gon' turn out?

05:42.408 --> 05:44.077
Plus one, plus one,
plus one, plus one.

05:44.143 --> 05:45.111
Donatella...

05:45.178 --> 05:46.312
are you flying with us?

05:46.379 --> 05:48.715
I wish that I was, babes,
but, um...

05:48.781 --> 05:50.116
{\an5}I've gotta stay here.

05:48.781 --> 05:50.116
{\an1}Why?

05:50.183 --> 05:53.519
{\an5}How you planning to stay--

05:50.183 --> 05:53.519
You know, a bitch be busy.

05:53.586 --> 05:56.322
I'm gutted
that I can't be in London.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.424
I have a full roster of clients
here in the States,

05:58.491 --> 06:01.160
I have events,
I have my radio show.

06:01.227 --> 06:02.729
I'm booked and busy, baby.

06:02.795 --> 06:05.098
But I know that they're
gonna have an amazing time.

06:05.164 --> 06:06.966
{\an5}I just need y'all to be ready
to turn up when we get there.

06:05.164 --> 06:06.966
{\an1}I'm ready!

06:07.033 --> 06:09.535
{\an5}I heard London got good men.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.535
{\an1}Oh...

06:09.602 --> 06:11.671
{\an4}I... so I'm ready
to get out there...

06:09.602 --> 06:11.671
I heard they got

06:11.738 --> 06:12.872
uncircumcised.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.407
{\an1}You mean to tell me
they're not circumcised?

06:14.474 --> 06:15.608
{\an1}It's like,
it's like a penis hood.

06:15.675 --> 06:17.210
We're acting like you
picky anyway.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.545
(laughter)

06:19.612 --> 06:20.546
(Donatella)
Let's toast.

06:20.613 --> 06:21.914
{\an1}(Bridget)
To London.

06:21.981 --> 06:24.183
And keep your manners,
keep it classy.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.686
{\an5}Keep it class, keep it class.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.686
{\an3}Class.

{\an5}(Lyrica)
Just when I thought things were
on the up-and-up with me and A1,

06:35.461 --> 06:37.864
Ray J started this mess again,

06:37.930 --> 06:39.966
first bringing Safaree
to our dinner,

06:40.032 --> 06:41.134
{\an8}and then after the poker game,

06:41.200 --> 06:43.469
{\an8}A1 comes home

{\an1}So kill your homegirl.
Or should I do it?

28:59.637 --> 29:03.141
{\an1}I'm saying I see something
in your ass that you don't see.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.176
I told you, bitch,
I got your money.

29:05.243 --> 29:07.078
What-- how much money
you got right there?

29:07.145 --> 29:08.546
{\an5}(bleep), maybe like...

29:07.145 --> 29:08.546
What the (bleep) is that?

29:08.613 --> 29:09.914
I don't know, but, like,
it's something.

29:09.981 --> 29:11.116
I keep bread.

29:11.182 --> 29:13.017
{\an1}You want some mother(bleep)
money? Hold on.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.686
{\an4}I keep it.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.686
{\an3}Oh, my God.

29:14.752 --> 29:16.020
All hundreds.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.756
This ain't no money nobody
gave me. This my (bleep).

29:18.823 --> 29:21.693
{\an1}And I'm in a strip club
looking like (bleep) idiot,

29:21.759 --> 29:25.196
in the 'hood, coming to get what
I'm supposed to be investing in.

29:25.263 --> 29:26.431
Is this what I'm getting?

29:26.498 --> 29:27.999
No, you ain't
getting this.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.767
You're gonna get something
that's worth it.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.736
{\an5}Like, I'm....

29:29.834 --> 29:31.736
Do you think you're worth it?

29:31.803 --> 29:34.806
{\an5}I am worth it,
I'm always worth it, I am.

29:31.803 --> 29:34.806
Okay, well, show me, damn!

29:34.873 --> 29:37.342
{\an1}You don't get cats
that save a ho every day.

29:37.408 --> 29:39.844
{\an1}You want somebody throwing
dollars or hundreds?

29:39.911 --> 29:41.179
{\an4}Okay?

29:39.911 --> 29:41.179
I got bills to pay for!

29:41.246 --> 29:42.313
Okay, I'm listening.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.314
Like, what the (bleep) else?

29:43.381 --> 29:44.682
Just popping up at my job?

29:44.749 --> 29:46.951
Over (bleep) here,
bitches get whatever.

29:47.018 --> 29:49.020
{\an1}All these (bleep) bitches
got in common

29:49.087 --> 29:51.122
{\an5}with your (bleep) ass...

29:49.087 --> 29:51.122
What, bitch, what?!

29:51.189 --> 29:54.592
{\an5}What?! What?!

29:51.189 --> 29:54.592
{\an1}Get your ass off that stage
and (bleep) that bull(bleep)!

29:54.659 --> 29:56.127
You're stressing me out!

29:56.194 --> 29:58.696
{\an5}(Apple)
No one ever looked out for me
except for me.

29:58.763 --> 30:00.398
So Shun says
she gonna look out for me,

30:00.465 --> 30:02.734
ain't no guarantee
I'ma see some return,

30:02.800 --> 30:04.502
I had to think about that one.

30:04.569 --> 30:06.571
The day we had to meet up
with the lawyer,

30:06.638 --> 30:08.006
I had a gig to do,

30:08.072 --> 30:10.608
and that actually pays my bills
and feeds my children,

30:10.675 --> 30:12.177
so I had to do
what I had to do.

30:12.243 --> 30:14.179
{\an5}I been there!

30:12.243 --> 30:14.179
Had you been there,

30:14.245 --> 30:15.847
then you know
what type of bitch I am.

30:15.914 --> 30:18.516
{\an1}I'ma turn back to what
the (bleep) I'ma turn back to.

30:18.583 --> 30:22.153
{\an4}You ain't got to when
somebody's telling you...

30:18.583 --> 30:22.153
{\an1}Okay, but I'm not gonna lean
on nobody!

30:22.220 --> 30:24.122
{\an1}It's time
to get paid for work.

30:24.189 --> 30:25.456
I'm on your team, man.

30:25.523 --> 30:26.824
Don't push me away.

30:26.891 --> 30:27.959
{\an5}Everybody pushes me away.

30:26.891 --> 30:27.959
I'm not trying...

30:28.026 --> 30:29.127
It's just something
I'm used to.

30:29.194 --> 30:31.629
{\an5}This is, this is...

30:29.194 --> 30:31.629
Well, don't, baby.

30:31.696 --> 30:33.164
I'm your out.

30:34.432 --> 30:36.134
{\an3}All right.

30:36.201 --> 30:38.469
{\an1}I apologize for not
showing up for the meeting.

30:38.536 --> 30:39.571
That is my fault.

30:39.637 --> 30:40.805
I'm just...
just the way I am.

30:40.872 --> 30:41.806
It's hard trusting people.

30:41.873 --> 30:43.508
So, I'll try to be better.

30:43.575 --> 30:44.609
You can't even look at me.

30:44.676 --> 30:45.777
I know,
'cause it's too much--

30:45.843 --> 30:48.179
{\an4}No, why?

30:45.843 --> 30:48.179
I, I don't know,
it's just me.

30:48.246 --> 30:50.315
{\an1}Yeah. I'm up
for the challenge, Apple.

30:50.381 --> 30:52.116
{\an1}I'm gonna make you
look dead at me

30:52.183 --> 30:53.985
{\an1}and I'm gonna make sure
your bank account up there

30:54.052 --> 30:56.854
so you can look at everybody
and be like, "Bitch, what?"

30:59.157 --> 31:01.492
{\an8}♪♪

31:01.559 --> 31:04.629
{\an8}(La'Britney)
I know I probably came
at Moniece a little hard,

31:04.696 --> 31:05.997
{\an8}but I'm from Detroit.

31:06.064 --> 31:07.799
{\an8}You either go hard
or you go the (bleep) home.

31:07.865 --> 31:10.034
But I gotta admit
that being aggressive

31:10.101 --> 31:13.671
ain't always
the right first reaction.

31:13.738 --> 31:17.208
{\an1}I really appreciate Paris
for setting this up, you know?

31:17.275 --> 31:19.444
{\an8}We ought to, um...

31:17.275 --> 31:19.444
{\an8}Just kinda got off to a...

31:19.510 --> 31:20.645
{\an5}A rough start.

31:19.510 --> 31:20.645
...a rough beginning.

31:20.712 --> 31:21.913
{\an4}Yeah.

31:20.712 --> 31:21.913
{\an3}You know?

31:21.980 --> 31:23.781
{\an7}I think it was
a little, like, harsh,

31:23.848 --> 31:25.350
{\an8}the way you came off but...

31:25.416 --> 31:26.517
I was just so frustrated

31:26.584 --> 31:28.386
because every time
I run into somebody,

31:28.453 --> 31:29.921
{\an5}I'm, like, explaining myself.

31:28.453 --> 31:29.921
{\an1}Right.

31:29.988 --> 31:31.522
I'm not (bleep) A1,
I ain't (bleep) A1.

31:31.589 --> 31:33.157
{\an4}Right.

31:31.589 --> 31:33.157
Like, you're a mother.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.193
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.193
You know, I'm a mother,
I have two boys.

31:35.260 --> 31:36.995
I have two older boys,
you know?

31:37.061 --> 31:38.496
They watch
everything that I do,

31:38.563 --> 31:40.999
and they always make it
seem like we gotta (bleep)

31:41.065 --> 31:44.502
to be successful as women
in this industry,

31:44.569 --> 31:46.170
{\an5}and it's like,
when you have talent,
it speaks for itself.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.273
{\an5}You don't gotta (bleep)
for a track.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.273
{\an1}Right.

31:48.339 --> 31:49.407
It's just like,
'cause I'm like,

31:49.474 --> 31:50.842
"Man, these people
don't even know me."

31:50.908 --> 31:52.377
I'm new out here,
you feel me?

31:52.443 --> 31:53.511
And this is
what they're thinking,

31:53.578 --> 31:55.179
this is what is...
was going on.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.347
And again, like,
I wanna be clear.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.349
{\an5}I didn't say that you did that.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.349
{\an3}Right.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.718
I absolutely said
that I heard that.

32:00.785 --> 32:03.621
{\an6}Right.

32:00.785 --> 32:03.621
And at Donatella's showcase,

32:03.688 --> 32:06.391
{\an1}Lyrica told me that you,
like, slid into A1's DM's.

32:06.457 --> 32:09.027
Listen, I'm new out here,
you feel me? So, like...

32:09.093 --> 32:11.529
{\an5}And you know what?

32:09.093 --> 32:11.529
...you socialize
by DM'g people.

32:11.596 --> 32:14.232
{\an4}Let me...

32:11.596 --> 32:14.232
I'm sure a lot of the (bleep)
you (bleep) with these days,

32:14.299 --> 32:16.034
the conversation started
in a DM.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.435
(Teairra)
Look, La'Britney's right.

32:17.502 --> 32:20.071
If you wanna work with somebody
or get to know 'em,

32:20.138 --> 32:22.407
it shouldn't be a problem
sliding in their DM's.

32:22.473 --> 32:24.509
Doesn't mean you're
trying to sleep with 'em.

32:24.575 --> 32:25.810
Sounds like a bunch of lies.

32:25.877 --> 32:26.978
It's a bunch of lies.

32:27.045 --> 32:28.680
And it's so annoying
because, like,

32:28.746 --> 32:31.783
everything that I'm doing,
I'm literally doing it

32:31.849 --> 32:34.752
by myself and, actually,
as of lately,

32:34.819 --> 32:39.223
I've been working to spread
my music out here in the UK.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.192
I linked up
with this British rapper.

32:41.259 --> 32:42.960
Her name is Lady LeShurr,

32:43.027 --> 32:44.629
and she did a verse
on "Actin' Funny,"

32:44.696 --> 32:46.197
so I'ma put it out
as the "fe-mix."

32:46.264 --> 32:48.399
{\an1}That's the one
you had with, uh...

32:48.466 --> 32:49.467
{\an5}Kash Doll, okay.

32:48.466 --> 32:49.467
Kash Doll, yup.

32:49.534 --> 32:50.802
Super poppin' out here.

32:50.868 --> 32:52.236
(Moniece)
I must admit,

32:52.303 --> 32:53.571
I may have judged La'Britney

32:53.638 --> 32:55.406
just a little too harshly
in the beginning,

32:55.473 --> 32:57.809
but she's just a woman
hustling in this business

32:57.875 --> 32:58.943
like the rest of us,

32:59.010 --> 33:01.112
so I can definitely
respect it.

33:01.179 --> 33:03.981
{\an5}No harm, no foul.

33:01.179 --> 33:03.981
Cheers to new beginnings.

33:04.048 --> 33:05.950
{\an5}New beginnings.

33:04.048 --> 33:05.950
Unity, success

33:06.017 --> 33:07.151
and big (bleep).

33:07.218 --> 33:08.753
{\an4}Oh...

33:07.218 --> 33:08.753
(laughter)

33:08.820 --> 33:10.722
What about (bleep)?

33:10.788 --> 33:12.490
{\an5}Oh, yeah, I forgot about you.

33:10.788 --> 33:12.490
(laughter)

33:12.557 --> 33:13.958
{\an1}Cheers.

33:14.025 --> 33:15.927
{\an8}(woman)
Coming up.

33:15.993 --> 33:17.261
{\an8}So, welcome back to London.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.130
{\an7}Thank you.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.130
{\an8}And why are you back here?

33:19.197 --> 33:21.099
{\an8}(Brooke)
Hi!

33:19.197 --> 33:21.099
{\an5}Are you coming over
to join us?

33:21.165 --> 33:22.100
{\an8}Yes, baby.

33:22.166 --> 33:23.501
{\an8}♪♪

33:30.208 --> 33:33.444
♪♪

33:38.850 --> 33:39.951
{\an7}(Bridget)
Yeah, right.

33:40.017 --> 33:41.986
{\an7}Yeah, my first full-length
album.

33:42.053 --> 33:43.287
{\an6}I know you.

33:42.053 --> 33:43.287
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.756
And I feel like I know
more about you now,

33:44.822 --> 33:46.057
{\an5}listening to this album--

33:44.822 --> 33:46.057
{\an1}Yeah.

33:46.124 --> 33:47.558
{\an8}--then I knew previously.

33:47.625 --> 33:48.926
{\an7}100%.

33:47.625 --> 33:48.926
{\an8}It's a very honest album.

33:48.993 --> 33:50.294
(Bridget)
Today I'm hosting some press

33:50.361 --> 33:52.730
in promo of my new album,
"Reality Bites,"

33:52.797 --> 33:55.733
so I get to talk to my guy
DJ Ace from the radio station

33:55.800 --> 33:58.736
and overall, just some cool
UK media and press.

33:58.803 --> 33:59.937
Will you come back
to tour the album?

34:00.004 --> 34:01.305
{\an1}Yeah, I wanna do
a full UK tour again

34:01.372 --> 34:02.373
{\an1}the way that we did
last time,

34:02.440 --> 34:03.574
{\an1}so I'm hoping
that we can do that

34:03.641 --> 34:05.276
{\an1}in the, in the next couple
of months or so.

34:05.343 --> 34:06.411
{\an5}I'm excited.

34:05.343 --> 34:06.411
{\an1}Yeah.

34:06.477 --> 34:07.478
Bridget Kelly,
thank you so much.

34:07.545 --> 34:08.780
{\an1}Yay, thanks, DJ Ace,
you're the best.

34:08.846 --> 34:10.081
(both laugh)

34:10.148 --> 34:12.382
1Xtra, everything R&amp;B,
Ace in the house...

34:12.449 --> 34:14.118
Well, outside the house
at the moment.

34:14.185 --> 34:16.219
It's refreshing
to come back to the UK

34:16.286 --> 34:18.790
and reengage
with all of my fan base here

34:18.856 --> 34:20.558
because I always have
a good time with them.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.025
It's really nice to feel like

34:22.092 --> 34:24.929
the big fish in a small pond
across the pond.

34:24.996 --> 34:26.063
A girl could get used to this.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.398
{\an5}Hi, I'm Jason--

34:26.130 --> 34:27.398
{\an1}Hi.

34:27.465 --> 34:28.966
{\an8}from Colourful Radio.

34:27.465 --> 34:28.966
{\an8}Nice to meet you.

34:29.033 --> 34:30.368
{\an8}My name's Nathan Devonte--

34:29.033 --> 34:30.368
{\an7}Hi.

34:30.435 --> 34:32.235
{\an8}--and I'm from
TEAmCurtains.com.

34:32.303 --> 34:33.771
{\an5}Nice to meet you.

34:32.303 --> 34:33.771
So, welcome back to London.

34:33.838 --> 34:36.607
{\an4}Thank you.

34:33.838 --> 34:36.607
And why are you back here?

34:36.674 --> 34:38.275
{\an1}There will be a show
at Clapham Grand tomorrow

34:38.342 --> 34:40.578
{\an1}and I cannot wait for that.
It's gonna be so good.

34:40.645 --> 34:43.080
This time you're back
with "Reality Bites."

34:43.147 --> 34:45.349
{\an1}Yes, this is my first
full-length album, so this is--

34:45.416 --> 34:46.851
{\an6}Yes.

34:45.416 --> 34:46.851
--this is a huge deal for me.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.520
{\an5}So you're living
in Hollywood right now.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.520
{\an1}I am.

34:49.587 --> 34:52.523
{\an5}(Brooke)
Bridget, come on,
this press junket

34:52.590 --> 34:53.791
looks boring.

34:53.858 --> 34:56.027
I'm gonna do my friend
a good old service

34:56.092 --> 34:58.096
and spice up
this little interview

34:58.162 --> 35:01.032
by giving the British tea
a little stir.

35:01.098 --> 35:02.333
So many singers--

35:01.098 --> 35:02.333
{\an1}Yes.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.703
--and, um, how is your
songwriting process?

35:05.770 --> 35:06.871
(Brooke)
Hi!

35:06.938 --> 35:08.272
Are you coming over
to join us?

35:08.339 --> 35:10.241
I haven't seen you
since "Girlfight."

35:10.308 --> 35:11.676
{\an1}Yes, baby.

35:11.742 --> 35:12.877
I'm still alive.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.912
{\an6}(laughing)

35:12.944 --> 35:14.912
What's going on, sis?

35:14.979 --> 35:17.081
{\an5}We having interviews for the--

35:14.979 --> 35:17.081
You want some banana?

35:17.148 --> 35:18.182
{\an7}No.

35:17.148 --> 35:18.182
{\an7}Bridget...

35:18.249 --> 35:19.884
{\an8}Hi. How are you?

35:18.249 --> 35:19.884
{\an8}Hi, how you doing?

35:19.951 --> 35:22.487
{\an6}La'Britney.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.487
{\an1}I'ma come outta
retirement real soon.

35:22.553 --> 35:24.655
{\an5}Wait, your child's
called London
and you're in London.

35:24.722 --> 35:27.959
{\an1}My child's name is London,
I did, and he's with his dad.

35:28.025 --> 35:30.394
He was conceived here, so...

35:30.461 --> 35:33.197
{\an5}Then I see...

35:30.461 --> 35:33.197
Bridget was on that thing
being all professional

35:33.264 --> 35:36.167
{\an8}and "Yes, yes, my album
is coming out soon,"

35:36.234 --> 35:37.835
and I had to be the one to say,

35:37.902 --> 35:40.171
"Come on
out your shell, Bridget."

35:40.238 --> 35:41.906
The UK needs to know
we're here, honey.

35:41.973 --> 35:42.907
Let me tell you something.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.408
My girl La'Britney,

35:44.475 --> 35:45.576
she got it going on.

35:45.643 --> 35:46.577
She got a single coming out.

35:46.644 --> 35:47.712
'Cause she's what's up.

35:47.778 --> 35:49.146
So, I have,
I have a single out

35:49.213 --> 35:50.615
{\an5}called "Actin' Funny."

35:49.213 --> 35:50.615
{\an3}Yeah.

35:50.681 --> 35:52.617
{\an1}It's now featuring Kash Doll,
and I just did a remix

35:52.683 --> 35:54.485
{\an1}where I put Lady LeShurr
on it as well.

35:54.552 --> 35:56.287
{\an1}It's called
the "Actin' Funny Fe-mix."

35:56.354 --> 35:57.655
{\an6}Mm-hmm.

35:56.354 --> 35:57.655
And I've been wanting

35:57.722 --> 35:59.924
{\an1}to, you know, like spread
my music out here in the UK,

35:59.991 --> 36:01.058
because I do have, like,

36:01.125 --> 36:03.027
a nice following, like,

36:03.094 --> 36:04.562
{\an5}on my social media.

36:03.094 --> 36:04.562
That's why you should open

36:04.629 --> 36:05.830
{\an5}for Bridget.

36:04.629 --> 36:05.830
Uh...

36:05.897 --> 36:07.131
{\an6}For real.

36:05.897 --> 36:07.131
That would be dope.

36:07.198 --> 36:08.466
I just thought of it.

36:08.533 --> 36:10.468
I didn't even plan
on having an opener,

36:10.535 --> 36:12.203
but La'Britney got--
La'Britney got it.

36:12.270 --> 36:13.471
{\an5}La'Britney.

36:12.270 --> 36:13.471
La'Britney got it,
it's fine.

36:13.538 --> 36:14.472
You ready to get...

36:14.539 --> 36:15.473
{\an1}Oh...

36:15.540 --> 36:16.641
(Bridget)
Hold up.

36:16.707 --> 36:18.175
Everything was going
perfectly fine

36:18.242 --> 36:21.078
and then in walks Brooke
with this dumb-ass banana,

36:21.145 --> 36:23.147
and now she's pressing me

36:23.214 --> 36:25.383
to have La'Britney
open for my show?

36:25.449 --> 36:26.551
What is going on here?

36:26.617 --> 36:28.386
{\an1}The last album was
the Bridget Kelly album.

36:28.452 --> 36:30.488
Teairra, what?

36:30.555 --> 36:32.623
{\an1}Teairra, yes,
that's Teairra Mari.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.791
Oh, wait, you better
grab a chair, there's a--

36:33.858 --> 36:34.825
what, there's a space
right here.

36:34.892 --> 36:35.826
What? Wait...

36:39.096 --> 36:41.065
{\an5}Because I just...

36:39.096 --> 36:41.065
{\an1}See, she in there cooking.
(laughs)

36:44.835 --> 36:46.270
{\an5}She's trying
to finish her cooking.

36:44.835 --> 36:46.270
Teairra, come out here.

36:46.337 --> 36:48.306
She's just trying to finish
her cooking.

36:48.372 --> 36:49.473
{\an4}No, get...

36:48.372 --> 36:49.473
She don't even...

36:49.540 --> 36:50.741
It's a lot--
she's in her negligee.

36:50.808 --> 36:52.710
We don't want to expose her
like this.

36:52.777 --> 36:55.046

Come on, girl, sit down.

I was just coming outside

that the chicken that I was
making was almost ready.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.453
I didn't realize I'd be
stepping into all of this.

in under two minutes.

38:53.097 --> 38:54.298
So now, instead of talking

38:54.365 --> 38:56.534
about my incredible album,
"Reality Bites,"

38:56.600 --> 38:58.736
I have to go do damage control
with Teairra

38:58.803 --> 39:01.839
because I invited these British
clowns to come and interview me.

39:01.906 --> 39:04.675
{\an5}(knocking)

39:01.906 --> 39:04.675
That interview was out of pocket
and I'm really sorry.

39:04.742 --> 39:06.010
I did not...
I had no idea

39:06.077 --> 39:07.745
that they were gonna
take it there with you.

39:07.812 --> 39:09.346
I was already pissed off
that (bleep) Brooke

39:09.413 --> 39:11.682
was sitting out there
on bull(bleep) and I just...

39:11.749 --> 39:12.983
I feel really awful, man.

39:13.050 --> 39:14.318
I really, like... I don't...

39:14.385 --> 39:16.487
That was not,
that was not part of the plan.

39:16.554 --> 39:19.924
I have poured my blood, sweat
and tears into this album,

39:19.990 --> 39:22.359
and now, rather than be
at my best,

{\an7}That was set up specifically
for my album promo

39:43.781 --> 39:46.484

took over the whole (bleep).

39:46.550 --> 39:48.085

supposed to hold me down,
