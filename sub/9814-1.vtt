05:33.584 --> 05:34.667
How are you?

05:34.751 --> 05:37.084
Glad to see you.

05:38.792 --> 05:42.292
I can see that...
You've got an erection.

05:42.334 --> 05:44.084
Come in!

05:44.167 --> 05:46.667
No wonder I get criticized
at neighbors' meetings!

05:53.042 --> 05:56.584
Don't you remember Truman?
He won't bite you.

05:56.667 --> 05:59.001
Truman,
your uncle's afraid of you.

05:59.084 --> 06:00.417
Where's your luggage?

06:00.542 --> 06:02.834
At the hotel,
at the end of the street.

06:02.917 --> 06:05.126
At the hotel?
Why don't you stay here?

06:05.209 --> 06:08.334
You snore
and your dog doesn't like me...

06:10.751 --> 06:13.667
Why the hell didn't you tell me
you were coming?

06:13.751 --> 06:17.292
Paula told me
a surprise would do you good.

06:17.376 --> 06:19.292
Yes, I know...

06:19.376 --> 06:22.917
You talk to my cousin
behind my back.

06:22.959 --> 06:27.542
You don't tell me much,
so what should I do?

06:27.667 --> 06:31.042
I feel bad for not coming earlier.

06:31.126 --> 06:32.459
You should!

06:32.542 --> 06:35.126
I hope you find it hard
to sleep at night.

06:35.209 --> 06:36.459
Well, I do have trouble sleeping.

06:37.959 --> 06:41.334
I'm spending a fortune on therapy
because of you.

06:41.417 --> 06:42.542
Good.

06:42.626 --> 06:44.501
I've even changed therapists.

06:44.584 --> 06:46.584
- Really?
- Yes.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.084
Me too.

06:48.959 --> 06:52.751
I have a kind of spiritual guide now.

06:52.834 --> 06:53.959
A spiritual guide?

06:54.042 --> 06:58.542
Yeah, a shaman from the Amazon
who lives in Vallecas.

07:03.126 --> 07:06.709
I bought a few things
at the airport.

07:06.792 --> 07:09.001
That's some really great whisky,
you'll love it.

07:10.917 --> 07:12.917
How nice.

07:14.792 --> 07:16.792
- Besides...
- What's this?

07:16.876 --> 07:21.959
Ah, that's a drawing
from my kids.

07:25.084 --> 07:30.167
Now see, these are the things
we'll have to avoid,

07:30.292 --> 07:31.542
otherwise...

07:36.626 --> 07:39.001
How many days can you stay?

07:40.001 --> 07:41.709
- Four.
- Only four?

07:41.792 --> 07:44.209
Yes, I have to be back
next Monday.

07:44.292 --> 07:47.084
We got any money?
I'm broke.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.834
Yes, we can do
whatever you want.

07:50.126 --> 07:53.292
You hear that?
We're going to have a great time together.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.542
You're not here
to talk me into anything, right?

07:58.626 --> 08:02.584
No need to get so defensive,
Julián.

08:02.667 --> 08:05.084
Paula asked you to come
and change my mind, didn't she?

08:05.167 --> 08:07.501
No, I came
because I wanted to see you.

08:07.584 --> 08:10.626
- Besides...
- Besides?

08:12.501 --> 08:16.001
It's true that when you told me
what you'd decided,

08:16.126 --> 08:18.876
I thought maybe...
maybe we could talk about it.

08:18.959 --> 08:21.251
- Really?
- Yeah. Can't we?

08:21.376 --> 08:22.709
You can head back to Canada
right now!

08:22.751 --> 08:25.834
- You can go back to your penguins.
- Julián, listen.

08:25.876 --> 08:29.376
Look, take the chocolates, the whisky...
No, I'll keep the whisky.

08:29.459 --> 08:33.667
Go back now, if you hurry,
you'll make the return flight.

08:33.751 --> 08:35.292
Screw that.

08:37.458 --> 08:39.751
You know
how much my ticket cost?

08:41.542 --> 08:45.417
I'll stay four days,
you'll have to put up with me.

08:55.001 --> 08:58.751
Go with your uncle.
I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.

08:58.834 --> 09:02.292
I'll join you in 20 minutes.
I have an appointment with the doctor.

09:58.751 --> 10:00.209
Are you a friend of Julián's?

10:02.584 --> 10:03.834
Yes.

10:05.001 --> 10:06.959
Why?

10:07.042 --> 10:09.251
Give him this,
he ordered it days ago,

10:09.334 --> 10:11.209
but I never see him.

10:14.834 --> 10:16.167
Okay.

10:17.501 --> 10:19.084
That's 50 euros.

10:19.167 --> 10:21.584
Oh, yes... of course.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.292
Here.

10:31.209 --> 10:33.834
Is Julián all right?

10:33.917 --> 10:35.876
Yes, he's at home.

10:36.001 --> 10:37.459
Good.

10:37.542 --> 10:40.542
It's just that I haven't seen him
for days,

10:40.626 --> 10:45.626
and when I saw you with Truman,
I thought maybe he got worse or...

10:45.709 --> 10:48.084
No, he's fine.

10:49.334 --> 10:53.834
Great... I'm glad.

10:53.917 --> 10:57.042
- Tell him I said hi.
- I will.

11:13.292 --> 11:14.376
So?

11:15.417 --> 11:17.417
- Great.
- Really?

11:19.459 --> 11:22.751
Wait a minute.
Come here, Truman.

11:24.792 --> 11:27.042
- Can I leave him for a while?
- Of course.

11:27.126 --> 11:29.792
I'll be back soon. Thanks.

11:33.709 --> 11:36.251
My neighbor,
she always looks after him.

11:36.334 --> 11:37.542
Shall we go?

11:37.626 --> 11:39.001
- Walking?
- Yeah.

11:40.876 --> 11:44.042
First, I need to see the vet.
It's just some blocks away.

11:44.126 --> 11:45.167
Okay.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.792
CAT MISSING

11:52.126 --> 11:53.334
Which one should I put?

11:53.417 --> 11:57.042
- What for?
- To put him up for adoption.

11:58.042 --> 12:00.167
Do you want
to put him up for adoption?

12:00.251 --> 12:02.334
Of course. What should I do?

12:02.417 --> 12:04.167
What about your cousin?

12:04.251 --> 12:06.501
No, not Paula.

12:06.584 --> 12:09.001
She lives in a small apartment,
she has a cat.

12:09.084 --> 12:12.501
I'm worried, really.
I haven't told him yet.

12:15.084 --> 12:17.042
- What?
- What will happen.

12:19.126 --> 12:22.501
- To whom?
- Truman. I tell him everything.

12:23.334 --> 12:25.334
Dogs aren't plants, Tomás.

12:25.417 --> 12:28.376
You have no fucking idea.
They have personality.

12:28.459 --> 12:29.834
Yes, I've realized.

12:29.917 --> 12:34.334
Earlier at the park, Truman asked me
about the bears in Canada.

12:34.417 --> 12:35.542
See?

12:36.376 --> 12:39.376
Tomás, I have two children.

12:40.084 --> 12:41.709
One of them's called Truman.

12:42.959 --> 12:45.501
- Julián, he can see you now.
- Thank you.

13:04.001 --> 13:05.459
- Hi, Julián.
- Hi.

13:05.542 --> 13:07.751
Sorry I can't spend
more time with you,

13:07.834 --> 13:10.209
but you can see...
I'm doing a test.

13:10.251 --> 13:12.459
Thank you very much...
Sorry, Tomás, a friend.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.709
- Hello.
- Hello.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.834
- It's just a question.
- Tell me.

13:18.417 --> 13:21.292
- Is it his paw again?
- No, no, his paw's perfect.

13:21.376 --> 13:26.251
I wanted to ask you...
about something else.

13:26.334 --> 13:32.751
How do you think dogs
experience loss... grief?

13:36.584 --> 13:40.626
You mean if someone dies?

13:40.709 --> 13:42.501
Their owner, for example.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.709
How could we help him?

13:44.834 --> 13:47.292
Well, just like
when they're abandoned,

13:47.376 --> 13:49.459
the animal suffers
from the separation.

13:49.542 --> 13:52.834
What might happen to him?

13:52.917 --> 13:55.334
Would you both like to sit down?

13:55.417 --> 13:58.626
- Yes.
- No, that's okay.

13:58.709 --> 14:02.876
Well... he might be
kind of aloof,

14:02.959 --> 14:05.417
and he might have
psychosomatic reactions,

14:05.459 --> 14:10.501
like digestive problems,
irritable behavior...

14:13.667 --> 14:16.876
I'm looking for a family
to adopt him.

14:16.959 --> 14:20.959
What do you think?
Should I look for a similar...

14:21.042 --> 14:23.251
I mean, a man on his own like me,

14:23.376 --> 14:27.542
or a complete change,
such as a family with kids?

14:27.626 --> 14:31.417
I don't know,
I really don't, Julián.

14:31.459 --> 14:35.751
Do you think he could adapt
to living with other dogs?

14:35.834 --> 14:38.334
It's not what he's used to.

14:38.417 --> 14:41.334
It would be easier
if he didn't have to learn new habits.

14:41.417 --> 14:44.501
It'd be important for him
to feel really looked after,

14:44.584 --> 14:45.959
to feel that he's loved.

14:46.042 --> 14:47.126
One last thing.

14:47.209 --> 14:51.042
When I have to leave him definitely,

14:51.126 --> 14:54.084
do you think I should leave him
one of my T-shirts,

14:54.167 --> 14:57.917
or some clothes that smell like me,
is it a good idea?

14:58.001 --> 15:03.334
Well, having his own things,
like a blanket to lie on,

15:03.417 --> 15:06.542
or a ball, a toy, that'd be fine,
it'd be good for him,

15:06.626 --> 15:09.876
I'm not sure about your things,
I don't know...

15:09.959 --> 15:15.751
I could ask a colleague who specializes
in animal psychology for his opinion.

15:15.834 --> 15:18.542
I'd be very grateful.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.792
I'll do anything to help him.

15:21.876 --> 15:26.084
I also want to pay for several visits
in advance.

15:26.167 --> 15:28.084
I want his new owners
to bring him to you.

15:28.167 --> 15:33.751
I want to be sure that, even if his new home
is far away from here,

15:33.834 --> 15:35.042
that they'll bring him here.

15:35.126 --> 15:38.876
Don't worry, Julián.
We'll take care of him.

15:38.959 --> 15:42.376
He'll be fine, I promise.

15:43.542 --> 15:46.376
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

15:46.459 --> 15:48.834
- Bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

16:01.209 --> 16:06.209
Warn me ahead of time
before the next scene like that.

16:06.251 --> 16:08.376
I'm going to tell you
something important.

16:08.459 --> 16:09.542
Okay.

16:09.626 --> 16:13.459
The only things that matter
in life are relationships.

16:13.542 --> 16:15.376
Love.

16:15.459 --> 16:19.667
Family, you and me,
Truman and me...

16:19.751 --> 16:23.001
I need some breakfast
before going on with the day.

16:23.084 --> 16:26.042
Who would have thought

16:26.126 --> 16:28.167
we'd be friends
for so many years?

16:28.251 --> 16:31.626
I wouldn't have, really.

16:31.751 --> 16:36.459
You know the main thing
I've learned from you?

16:36.542 --> 16:40.042
What you've taught me
all these years unknowingly?

16:41.209 --> 16:42.834
Why don't we keep walking?

16:42.917 --> 16:44.792
Because I'm saying
something important,

16:44.834 --> 16:46.501
can't you wait one more minute?

16:46.584 --> 16:47.709
Why are you here?

16:47.792 --> 16:51.042
I want to have breakfast,
so that I'm ready.

16:55.917 --> 17:00.084
What's that important thing
you've learned from me? Let's see.

17:01.292 --> 17:04.584
You never expect anything
in return.

17:04.666 --> 17:06.501
You never want a payback.

17:09.166 --> 17:12.041
You're generous, unlike me.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.001
Thanks.

17:17.376 --> 17:20.416
- And me?
- What?

17:20.501 --> 17:22.084
What have you learned from me?

17:22.166 --> 17:25.416
From you?
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

17:25.459 --> 17:27.501
Maybe illegal things...

17:32.542 --> 17:34.042
To be brave.

17:39.834 --> 17:42.001
You've always faced
everything squarely.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.209
Like now.

17:50.709 --> 17:54.876
You see, this alone made the trip
from the North Pole worth it already.

18:23.167 --> 18:25.542
Sorry I'm late, Julián.

18:25.626 --> 18:26.959
Don't worry, doctor.

18:27.042 --> 18:31.459
I know you'd rather see my cousin,
she's cuter than my friend here,

18:31.542 --> 18:35.126
but he's come for a few days
and I just can't shake him off.

18:35.209 --> 18:36.751
He came from Canada.

18:36.834 --> 18:38.876
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:39.001 --> 18:41.334
To say goodbye.

18:41.417 --> 18:44.001
Well...

18:44.084 --> 18:49.084
As I told you, we should start
another round of chemotherapy.

18:49.167 --> 18:50.876
We're going to change
the medicine,

18:50.959 --> 18:54.542
to try to have a greater effect
on the tumors.

18:54.667 --> 18:59.042
As I told you the last time we met,
I'll schedule you for a CAT scan,

18:59.126 --> 19:03.501
to see how far those new tumors
on the liver have gone.

19:03.584 --> 19:07.917
Could you come in tomorrow
or the day after for some tests?

19:08.001 --> 19:10.501
And I'll schedule
the CAT scan for Friday?

19:10.584 --> 19:11.876
No.

19:12.959 --> 19:15.917
I've come to tell you
I'm not coming back.

19:17.959 --> 19:22.667
Julián, when we talked
about the test results the other day,

19:22.792 --> 19:24.501
I gave you the impression that...

19:24.584 --> 19:27.292
We've done everything we could,
haven't we, doctor?

19:27.376 --> 19:28.667
Yes.

19:29.709 --> 19:33.001
We've fought hard
these past few months, right?

19:35.542 --> 19:40.001
I don't want to spend whatever
I have left in and out of the hospital.

19:40.084 --> 19:44.542
I'll miss the nurses very much,
that's for sure, but...

19:45.542 --> 19:47.001
I'm done.

19:48.376 --> 19:53.376
I've been fighting
this lung cancer for a year,

19:53.459 --> 19:55.542
and when I was taking
some time off,

19:55.626 --> 19:59.376
this son of a bitch goes
on excursion all over my body.

20:01.542 --> 20:04.542
What good will it do
starting chemo again?

20:05.917 --> 20:09.792
I mean,
if I start the treatment again,

20:09.876 --> 20:11.167
will I be cured?

20:11.251 --> 20:14.334
I know people don't usually ask
these things, but I do.

20:14.417 --> 20:16.251
Will I be cured?

20:17.417 --> 20:20.376
No.
I don't think so.

20:20.417 --> 20:23.209
I'm going to die anyway,
no matter what I do, right?

20:26.501 --> 20:27.584
Yes.

20:32.792 --> 20:34.417
Why should I go on with it?

20:35.917 --> 20:38.542
To gain some time, Julián.

20:38.626 --> 20:41.126
Of course, of course.

20:41.209 --> 20:42.709
How long are we talking about?

20:42.792 --> 20:44.376
You promised to keep silent.

20:44.459 --> 20:49.042
You think I flew across the globe
to keep silent? How long?

20:49.126 --> 20:51.334
It's hard to say,

20:51.417 --> 20:55.042
but it'll be quicker
without the treatment.

20:55.126 --> 20:58.376
Well, it might be worth it.

20:59.917 --> 21:03.417
I've already made up my mind,
you know that.

21:03.501 --> 21:06.709
Sometimes we react impulsively,
and we make decisions,

21:06.792 --> 21:10.709
but then after thinking it over calmly,
you see things differently.

21:10.792 --> 21:13.667
I've been thinking this over calmly
for a year.

21:13.751 --> 21:15.959
You're the one
who just got here, Tomás.

21:19.834 --> 21:22.209
I should have come with Paula.

21:23.126 --> 21:28.084
If we don't continue with chemo,
how much longer can he hold on?

21:28.126 --> 21:31.751
It's hard to say...

21:31.834 --> 21:35.626
It'll depend on how the disease
plays out in the final stages.

21:35.709 --> 21:37.501
Right.

21:37.542 --> 21:40.126
Do I need to sign any papers?

21:40.209 --> 21:41.667
Er... no...

21:41.751 --> 21:46.709
I'll write a report
for the hospital committee,

21:46.834 --> 21:50.417
I'll explain your decision,

21:50.501 --> 21:52.917
and if you want, we could meet
in two weeks to see how you are.

21:53.042 --> 21:54.834
- Do you agree?
- All right.

21:54.917 --> 21:57.917
Prescribe all the drugs you can, okay?

22:02.626 --> 22:03.876
Well...

22:07.042 --> 22:08.959
I brought you something.

22:09.042 --> 22:11.417
It's a very bad movie
I made a few years ago,

22:11.501 --> 22:12.751
but since you told me
you like crime stories.

22:12.876 --> 22:16.834
- Yes. You didn't have to, Julián.
- I know.

22:18.126 --> 22:19.876
- Thanks for everything, doc.
- You're welcome.

22:19.959 --> 22:21.042
Bye.

22:29.584 --> 22:30.792
Thank you.

22:47.334 --> 22:49.834
I didn't mean to reproach you
for anything before.

22:49.917 --> 22:52.959
- Okay.
- We're all doing the best we can.

22:53.042 --> 22:56.667
No one's to blame.

22:59.209 --> 23:03.084
Well, my wife is.
She's to blame.

23:04.501 --> 23:08.251
She made me come,
I didn't want to.

23:08.334 --> 23:10.667
I knew something was fishy...

23:10.751 --> 23:13.167
Do you think I felt
like coming with you to...?

23:13.251 --> 23:15.376
No, I suppose not.

23:17.459 --> 23:22.667
She said if I didn't come now,
I'd regret it later...

23:22.751 --> 23:25.709
so I had no choice.

23:28.084 --> 23:32.042
- Where are we going?
- To eat, weren't you hungry?

23:32.167 --> 23:33.709
We're going
to a friend's restaurant.

23:33.792 --> 23:35.001
Pay.

23:46.292 --> 23:47.584
Where are you going, Tomás?

23:50.584 --> 23:52.251
- Hello.
- Hello.

23:58.459 --> 24:03.126
I'm looking for books
about animal psychology.

24:04.751 --> 24:08.167
Pets. Dogs.

24:08.251 --> 24:11.876
- Behavior patterns...
- Yes. Follow me.

24:14.209 --> 24:17.959
All the books about animals
and pets are here.

24:18.084 --> 24:22.084
You have nutrition,
dog behavior, health.

24:22.209 --> 24:23.542
This is everything we've got.

24:23.626 --> 24:25.376
- Great, thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:31.792 --> 24:33.584
This one looks good, doesn't it?

24:49.626 --> 24:53.126
I'm giving you these two. Okay?

24:53.209 --> 24:54.417
Thank you.

24:55.459 --> 24:56.584
This one?

25:03.667 --> 25:05.376
"Death, a New Dawn."

25:10.584 --> 25:12.209
"The author makes us understand

25:12.334 --> 25:15.917
that death is an experience
similar to birth."

25:16.001 --> 25:17.792
Sounds interesting,
don't you think?

25:24.084 --> 25:25.292
This one.

25:26.709 --> 25:28.667
"Helping to Die."

25:32.542 --> 25:37.042
If I were going to Thailand,
I'd need a map, that's the same.

25:37.126 --> 25:38.626
I'm a bit dizzy.

25:38.709 --> 25:41.667
Let's go.

26:07.376 --> 26:08.917
Who is it?

26:10.334 --> 26:13.084
Someone who has chosen
to ignore me.

26:14.959 --> 26:16.417
Maybe he didn't see you.

26:16.501 --> 26:19.126
No, he did see me,
but he's pretending otherwise.

26:23.459 --> 26:25.584
He's an actor.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.417
We've worked together
many times.

26:27.501 --> 26:32.167
He's not really a friend, but...
and his wife saw me, too.

26:32.251 --> 26:34.501
Well...

26:34.584 --> 26:36.834
Why wouldn't they say hi?

26:41.626 --> 26:43.667
Because people don't know
what to say to me.

26:45.167 --> 26:47.584
They smell death
and they get scared.

26:47.667 --> 26:50.042
- Got it.
- They don't know what to do.

26:50.126 --> 26:53.001
They prefer to avoid me.
I guess it's logical.

26:53.084 --> 26:55.459
I guess.
Can we change the subject while we eat?

26:55.584 --> 26:56.667
Yes, sorry.

27:00.292 --> 27:02.167
- Be right back.
- Julián.

27:02.251 --> 27:03.501
Julián...

27:06.667 --> 27:08.376
- Gerardo.
- Julián!

27:08.459 --> 27:10.084
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.

27:10.209 --> 27:12.042
Please, don't bother...

27:14.042 --> 27:16.459
How's everything?

27:16.542 --> 27:20.667
- Fine, fine.
- Glad to hear it.

27:20.751 --> 27:23.626
She's swamped with work.

27:23.751 --> 27:27.209
Not me, but... What about you?
Are you at the theater?

27:27.292 --> 27:29.834
- That's right.
- We'll come see you sometime.

27:29.917 --> 27:33.042
Don't wait too long,
my run's almost over.

27:33.167 --> 27:35.792
We'll see when we can go...
Are you eating here?

27:35.876 --> 27:39.292
Yes, over there,
at that table back there.

27:39.417 --> 27:42.417
We just got here,
we didn't see you.

27:43.709 --> 27:47.876
Yeah, you saw me,
but you pretended you didn't.

27:47.959 --> 27:49.959
Come on, Julián.

27:50.042 --> 27:53.751
I'm not asking you to call me
and ask how I'm doing,

27:53.834 --> 27:57.417
but if we run into each other
like today,

27:57.501 --> 28:00.876
saying hi, giving a hug,
some good wishes...

28:00.959 --> 28:02.709
would be appreciated.

28:04.167 --> 28:07.751
I think we won't meet again,

28:07.834 --> 28:12.251
so... I'll leave you.
Don't want to bother you.

28:26.917 --> 28:30.876
- Better?
- Better.

28:33.001 --> 28:34.751
- Paula.
- No, no.

28:34.834 --> 28:38.501
Paula, come on.
Aren't you good friends?

28:41.376 --> 28:46.417
DANGEROUS LIAISONS
EXTENDED RUN

28:52.209 --> 28:54.292
I'm begging you, take leave.

28:54.376 --> 28:57.292
Please consider my plea
and go away.

28:57.376 --> 28:59.626
My mother will be here
any minute and...

28:59.751 --> 29:02.126
if she found us like this,
we'd both be in serious trouble.

29:09.292 --> 29:14.126
Why does my heart beat
so strongly

29:14.209 --> 29:16.876
when I write to you?

29:16.959 --> 29:21.292
Don't get desperate.
Your friend, Cecil.

29:35.251 --> 29:36.626
Do you like it there?

29:36.667 --> 29:38.876
Have you ever thought
of coming back?

29:38.959 --> 29:40.751
No, never.

29:43.209 --> 29:45.126
You're very certain
about things.

29:45.209 --> 29:47.751
- It seems so, doesn't it?
- Yes.

29:49.376 --> 29:51.917
Haven't you ever considered
going back to Buenos Aires?

29:52.001 --> 29:57.292
I did last year,
when my ex and I split up...

29:57.376 --> 30:00.876
I really considered it,
but it's impossible.

30:00.959 --> 30:03.542
Separating Valentina
from her father wouldn't be right.

30:03.626 --> 30:09.042
He's having another baby soon.
Valentina's happy she'll have a brother.

30:09.126 --> 30:10.709
What can I do about it?

30:10.792 --> 30:14.417
It serves me right for getting involved
with a Spaniard, it was my fault.

30:19.042 --> 30:23.917
Thank you for answering
all my emails all these months.

30:24.001 --> 30:28.917
I'm good, I'm a very efficient
secretary, aren't I?

30:32.709 --> 30:36.001
What did the doctor tell him?

30:37.209 --> 30:39.792
You think he could reconsider?

30:41.167 --> 30:42.334
No.

30:43.376 --> 30:46.084
In fact, he went to the doctor
to say goodbye.

30:46.209 --> 30:48.334
Haven't you had a talk with him?

30:48.417 --> 30:52.126
He listens to you,
he values your opinion, Tomás.

30:53.334 --> 30:54.709
Yes.

30:57.376 --> 30:59.417
I tried.

30:59.501 --> 31:01.709
- But...
- But what?

31:01.834 --> 31:04.334
I didn't have any good arguments.

31:04.417 --> 31:08.084
I didn't know they were necessary
to keep on living?

31:09.834 --> 31:11.542
What could I do?

31:13.126 --> 31:15.042
Hey, don't get angry...

31:15.126 --> 31:17.167
No, I'm not angry,
I'm tired.

31:20.792 --> 31:25.001
Julián has lots of friends,
they invite him to parties...

31:25.084 --> 31:27.876
But then each one
has their life...

31:27.959 --> 31:32.376
Real friends are far away...
or just come for a visit.

31:37.376 --> 31:39.501
No, you're right.

31:40.876 --> 31:44.334
And I'm sorry.
It took me a long time to come.

31:44.417 --> 31:46.126
I know...

31:48.292 --> 31:51.126
He's the first of my friends
who is dying and...

31:54.001 --> 31:55.709
I don't know how to...

32:05.584 --> 32:08.792
I brought you a gift,
some chocolates,

32:08.876 --> 32:10.584
but I'll give them to Truman.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.959
Julián, what's wrong?

33:16.751 --> 33:19.626
Well, what do you think?
I'm sleeping.

33:21.876 --> 33:23.876
It's 4:00 in the morning.

33:24.917 --> 33:26.626
No, no, I don't want to talk.

33:29.292 --> 33:32.167
Okay, let's see.

33:34.959 --> 33:37.126
Why do you want me
to open the window?

33:37.251 --> 33:41.126
<i>So that you smell the marijuana
you bought me, it's excellent.</i>

33:41.209 --> 33:44.167
<i>I got so hungry...
Come over to my place. Aren't you hungry?</i>

33:44.251 --> 33:49.126
- I don't want to eat, I want to sleep.
- <i>Yes, so do I, but I can't.</i>

33:49.209 --> 33:52.001
<i>And when I finally do fall asleep,
I just keep dreaming...</i>

33:52.084 --> 33:54.834
<i>Mostly about my parents.</i>

33:54.917 --> 33:58.209
<i>I was reading one of those
instructive books you got me,</i>

33:58.292 --> 34:02.917
<i>and it says it's normal to dream
about dead people in my situation.</i>

34:03.001 --> 34:04.376
<i>You know why?</i>

34:04.459 --> 34:08.126
Yes... No... Well,
I don't remember right now.

34:08.208 --> 34:10.333
<i>Because it seems to be a way</i>

34:10.417 --> 34:14.876
<i>of subconsciously preparing
ourselves for the journey.</i>

34:14.958 --> 34:17.583
<i>Thinking about who's going
to come meet us.</i>

34:17.667 --> 34:19.208
They're going to meet you?

34:19.292 --> 34:22.001
<i>- Of course.
- I see, and where?</i>

34:22.042 --> 34:25.626
<i>I don't know yet,
I'm still on the first chapter.</i>

34:27.876 --> 34:30.126
<i>And you...</i>

34:30.208 --> 34:32.376
<i>Who would you want
to come meet you?</i>

34:36.792 --> 34:39.458
My mother, I guess.

34:41.458 --> 34:43.833
Or Marilyn Monroe.

34:44.833 --> 34:48.501
<i>I never got along too well
with my dad, you know that,</i>

34:48.583 --> 34:52.208
<i>but it'd make me feel safe
if he came.</i>

34:52.292 --> 34:55.751
<i>My mother was so flighty,
she's sure to be late or get lost.</i>

34:57.917 --> 34:59.667
Weren't you an atheist?

34:59.751 --> 35:02.792
<i>Very, yes, I used to be very atheist.
Not anymore.</i>

35:02.876 --> 35:04.292
I see...

35:08.084 --> 35:12.709
<i>Well, I'll keep reading.</i>

35:15.001 --> 35:18.709
<i>Sleep well.
Thank you for coming.</i>

35:18.792 --> 35:20.334
<i>I love you.</i>

35:56.834 --> 35:58.667
Good morning, sir.
Here's your breakfast.

36:02.001 --> 36:04.501
Yes, leave it right there,
please, thanks.

36:04.584 --> 36:07.084
I ordered scrambled eggs
and orange juice.

36:07.167 --> 36:09.959
That's what you have for breakfast
in Greenland, right?

36:16.251 --> 36:18.876
I want to give Truman
a quick bath.

36:19.001 --> 36:21.626
He hasn't gotten one in a while,
because I don't have a bathtub.

36:21.709 --> 36:24.542
And Paula won't let me do it in hers,
I don't know...

36:25.834 --> 36:29.917
Hurry up! We're meeting
an adoptive family.

36:45.334 --> 36:46.376
What's your son's name?

36:46.459 --> 36:49.376
- Sasha.
- What a nice name.

36:49.459 --> 36:53.042
We adopted him in Russia,
he was three years old.

36:53.084 --> 36:54.667
Have you had a dog before?

36:54.751 --> 36:58.459
No, honestly, my wife didn't want one,
but we finally convinced her.

36:58.542 --> 37:00.001
Sasha is really excited about it.

37:01.751 --> 37:03.876
So Truman,
do you like the house?

37:03.959 --> 37:06.751
It's very nice, very nice.

37:06.834 --> 37:09.459
I was telling them
we've never had a dog before...

37:09.542 --> 37:11.417
No, we had a cat.

37:11.501 --> 37:14.251
I've always liked cats better,
specially in an apartment...

37:14.334 --> 37:18.251
But since we moved here,
I have no excuse.

37:18.334 --> 37:20.042
He seems very well-behaved.

37:20.126 --> 37:23.251
And very clean.
I sent him to a private school.

37:25.417 --> 37:28.167
I'm having a hard time finding
someone who wants him.

37:28.251 --> 37:31.292
Almost everyone wants puppies.

37:31.376 --> 37:33.084
That won't be a problem for you?

37:33.167 --> 37:35.751
No, it's part of the therapy.

37:35.792 --> 37:36.959
It is? Therapy?

37:37.042 --> 37:41.042
Yes, the idea is adopting an animal
like we adopted him.

37:41.126 --> 37:45.167
It seems that identification between them
could be very beneficial for Sasha.

37:45.251 --> 37:47.959
That's interesting, isn't it?

37:48.042 --> 37:49.959
Yes, very much.

37:50.042 --> 37:52.126
Why do you want to get rid of him?

37:52.209 --> 37:53.292
Well, no...

37:53.376 --> 37:56.167
I'm going on a trip...
on a long trip,

37:56.251 --> 37:59.792
and... I can't take him with me.

37:59.876 --> 38:03.584
Well, you can come visit him
when you're back.

38:03.667 --> 38:06.084
Thank you, that would be nice.

38:06.167 --> 38:08.751
You'll see when you meet Sasha...

38:08.834 --> 38:12.709
It's really quiet here.
It's as if we're not in Madrid.

38:12.792 --> 38:15.251
Why don't you leave him
here with us?

38:15.334 --> 38:17.751
To see how it goes.

38:17.834 --> 38:19.084
Right now?

38:19.167 --> 38:23.667
Yes, to try for a day,
to see if he gets along with Sasha.

38:23.709 --> 38:25.917
Yes, yes...
But I didn't bring anything.

38:26.001 --> 38:28.959
Not even his toothbrush
or pajamas...

38:29.042 --> 38:31.001
I think it's a good idea.

38:32.834 --> 38:34.417
Don't you think?

38:34.501 --> 38:36.792
Since we're here...

38:36.876 --> 38:39.334
To see how Truman feels too, right?

38:39.417 --> 38:41.209
I don't know.

38:41.292 --> 38:42.709
Why not?

38:44.042 --> 38:45.792
- Why not?
- Maybe another day.

38:45.876 --> 38:47.376
When?

38:47.459 --> 38:50.501
Listen, we'll take good care of him.

39:01.709 --> 39:05.501
He's not used to sleeping alone,
or outside.

39:05.584 --> 39:08.251
Maybe he could sleep
in the boy's room.

39:08.334 --> 39:11.042
- Of course.
- He drinks a lot.

39:11.167 --> 39:15.334
You could give him dog food
but I usually boil rice,

39:15.417 --> 39:17.917
and add small pieces
of red meat.

39:18.001 --> 39:21.126
He really likes that.
And muffins.

39:21.209 --> 39:23.209
- Muffins?
- Yes.

39:27.209 --> 39:29.334
- Coffee?
- Yes.

39:37.084 --> 39:38.584
- Well...
- Well...

39:38.667 --> 39:42.501
I'll call you tomorrow
to pick him up.

39:42.584 --> 39:44.876
Or we'll bring him to you.

39:49.334 --> 39:51.084
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

39:51.167 --> 39:54.042
Be good, Truman.

39:54.126 --> 39:56.042
Don't make me look bad.

40:00.084 --> 40:02.584
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:04.709 --> 40:07.209
Come on, let's go.

40:20.501 --> 40:23.126
It's been so many years.

40:24.042 --> 40:25.709
We sleep together,
have showers together...

40:25.792 --> 40:27.459
- Enough, enough...
- Okay.

40:30.501 --> 40:32.376
Tonight you're staying
at my place.

40:32.501 --> 40:35.667
I don't like sleeping alone.
You can sleep on the sofa...

40:35.751 --> 40:36.876
Wherever you want.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.292
What are we going to do here?

41:04.501 --> 41:08.334
If you want, you can wait at the park.
It won't be fun.

41:36.167 --> 41:38.626
Who did you say you talked to?

41:38.709 --> 41:43.251
A woman. I talked to her
a couple of weeks ago.

41:43.334 --> 41:46.459
I said I'd come to see her,
but I couldn't make it until today.

41:46.584 --> 41:48.167
I guess it was Beatriz.
She's not here today.

41:48.251 --> 41:51.292
- If you don't mind, I'll help you.
- Yes, of course.

41:51.376 --> 41:54.042
Basically what I need
is an estimate.

41:54.084 --> 41:56.376
What kind of burial?
Who's the deceased?

41:56.459 --> 41:58.417
- Me.
- Oh.

41:58.501 --> 42:00.417
It will be me.

42:00.501 --> 42:04.209
He accompanies me
and helps me with all the procedures.

42:04.334 --> 42:07.167
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

42:07.251 --> 42:09.292
One moment, please.

42:39.001 --> 42:41.126
Will you come with me, please?

42:48.292 --> 42:51.417
What had you arranged
with my colleague?

42:51.501 --> 42:54.042
Well, nothing, in fact.

42:54.126 --> 42:57.542
I'm not sure whether I want...

42:57.626 --> 43:02.167
a regular funeral or cremation.

43:02.917 --> 43:07.751
I see. Well, that's
a very personal decision.

43:07.834 --> 43:10.792
Regarding prices,
they are quite similar.

43:10.876 --> 43:14.292
It depends on the quality
of the materials,

43:14.334 --> 43:17.459
both of urns and coffins.

43:17.542 --> 43:21.584
Do you have a family niche
or plot to be buried in?

43:21.626 --> 43:24.126
- No.
- No.

43:24.209 --> 43:28.834
We have some urns
for storing the ashes

43:28.876 --> 43:32.751
in the family home,
so that they are on display.

43:32.834 --> 43:37.917
These urns have different designs,
and very good details.

43:38.001 --> 43:44.126
We also have biodegradable urns,
which are buried like coffins.

43:44.209 --> 43:49.459
And finally, urns made of salt,
which dissolve in the sea.

43:49.542 --> 43:52.209
No, not in the sea.

43:52.292 --> 43:54.126
- No?
- No.

43:54.209 --> 43:57.417
If you prefer, we have
the White Porcelain option,

43:57.501 --> 44:04.751
it's this one with golden ornamental
ribbons, which give the urns solemnity.

44:05.751 --> 44:09.792
Excuse me, I have a question.
Aren't they a bit small?

44:09.876 --> 44:13.417
I mean,
do all the ashes fit in there?

44:14.542 --> 44:16.834
Of course, yes.

44:16.917 --> 44:22.251
Well, they end up... in just a tiny bit.

44:27.501 --> 44:34.542
I'll show you now...
the souvenirs and memorial cards.

44:34.626 --> 44:37.501
We can suggest an assortment
of poems if you want.

44:37.584 --> 44:42.376
Some cards play music
when you open them.

44:42.459 --> 44:43.542
- Music?
- Yes.

44:43.626 --> 44:46.834
Classical music,
people like it a lot.

44:46.917 --> 44:51.042
We also handle the flowers,
the ceremony,

44:51.126 --> 44:53.251
whether it's religious or not.

44:53.376 --> 44:57.292
If you want live music,
we have a small quartet.

44:57.376 --> 44:59.209
What else?
Ah, yes, very important.

44:59.292 --> 45:03.334
We make DVD with photos...

45:03.417 --> 45:07.001
and images of the person,

45:07.084 --> 45:10.084
which are shown at the ceremony.

45:13.667 --> 45:18.209
I'd love it if you could send me
several estimates,

45:18.251 --> 45:19.792
with everything
that's included in them.

45:19.876 --> 45:21.959
Could it be by email?

45:22.042 --> 45:24.501
Certainly, of course.

45:24.626 --> 45:27.251
Let me load your information
into the computer.

45:27.334 --> 45:29.584
- Yes.
- This way, please.

45:47.709 --> 45:50.084
I can leave you some money
if you need it.

45:50.167 --> 45:51.834
No.

45:53.709 --> 45:55.584
You'll need it.

46:00.084 --> 46:01.876
How much have you got
in the bank?

46:01.959 --> 46:04.084
In the bank, nothing.

46:04.917 --> 46:08.251
I owe money to the treasury department,
and they'd keep it all anyway.

46:08.334 --> 46:10.792
The only bit I've got is
in a cookie jar...

46:10.876 --> 46:14.751
I don't want to tell you where
because I don't trust you yet.

46:14.834 --> 46:17.584
I won't offer it again.

46:19.167 --> 46:20.834
Tell you what.

46:20.959 --> 46:24.209
Before you leave,
without me noticing it,

46:24.292 --> 46:28.709
you can leave me some money
somewhere... and that's it.

46:30.584 --> 46:33.584
If I see Marilyn,
I'll tell her about you.

46:37.834 --> 46:39.251
What are you doing?

46:39.334 --> 46:42.001
- Nothing, I'm hiding.
- Why?

46:45.709 --> 46:50.376
- Is he sitting down yet?
- He's sitting down, yes.

46:50.459 --> 46:51.876
Who is it?

46:53.626 --> 46:54.751
A friend.

46:57.917 --> 46:59.042
A friend?

47:00.667 --> 47:02.001
What did you do?

47:02.834 --> 47:06.709
I slept with his wife,
and soon after they divorced, that's all.

47:10.626 --> 47:11.876
He's heading this way.

47:11.959 --> 47:13.126
- He's coming over?
- Yes.

47:13.209 --> 47:15.876
If I were you,
I'd stop playing the fool.

47:17.042 --> 47:18.209
Julián...

47:18.334 --> 47:21.667
- Hello, Luis... How are you?
- Fine.

47:21.751 --> 47:23.209
- Such a long time...
- I'm fine.

47:23.292 --> 47:25.417
I didn't see you.
Did you just get here?

47:25.501 --> 47:28.959
Yes, we've just come in.
I wasn't sure if it was you.

47:30.584 --> 47:32.584
How are you?

47:32.667 --> 47:35.959
Well, very well.
Working, like always.

47:36.084 --> 47:39.417
- Hello.
- Still got your studio?

47:39.501 --> 47:42.751
Yes, I've got a French partner now.

47:42.834 --> 47:44.834
He gets me a lot of work.

47:44.917 --> 47:47.792
I'm glad to hear it.

47:47.876 --> 47:50.042
Julián...

47:50.126 --> 47:52.209
I'm really sorry
about what's happening to you.

47:52.292 --> 47:55.542
I just heard recently and...

47:55.626 --> 47:57.959
I'm really sorry
you're going through this.

47:58.042 --> 48:01.459
I just wanted to tell you.

48:01.542 --> 48:02.959
I often think of you.

48:08.084 --> 48:10.251
Thank you, Luis.

48:10.334 --> 48:12.167
Keep your spirits up.

48:12.251 --> 48:13.876
I'll let you get on with your meal.

48:26.334 --> 48:27.417
Thanks.

48:48.834 --> 48:50.417
Sorry to interrupt...

48:51.584 --> 48:53.959
I was just leaving and...

48:54.042 --> 48:56.959
I wanted to say goodbye.

48:57.001 --> 48:59.251
This is Mónica.
This is Julián.

48:59.334 --> 49:01.209
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

49:05.501 --> 49:08.251
Thank you for saying hello earlier.

49:09.584 --> 49:13.126
After what happened,
that you said hello the way you did,

49:13.209 --> 49:15.167
I didn't expect it.

49:15.251 --> 49:17.792
I'm really thankful.

49:17.876 --> 49:21.084
I'm very moved
and I want to apologize.

49:21.167 --> 49:23.084
No, it's not necessary, Julián.

49:23.167 --> 49:27.167
Yes, it is necessary,
it really is.

49:28.876 --> 49:31.959
I want to apologize
because you were my friend,

49:32.042 --> 49:34.917
and what I did was despicable.

49:35.042 --> 49:41.334
And I especially apologize
for not saying I was sorry at the time.

49:41.417 --> 49:43.751
Especially for that.
I could have done it, couldn't I?

49:43.834 --> 49:48.834
I accept your apologies.
Thank you.

49:48.917 --> 49:53.001
However, if that hadn't happened,
I wouldn't have met Mónica.

49:53.084 --> 49:54.251
She's pregnant.

49:54.334 --> 49:57.084
Really? That's great.

49:57.167 --> 49:59.876
Congratulations.
She's pregnant.

49:59.959 --> 50:01.084
Congratulations.

50:01.167 --> 50:04.959
- Thank you.
- Well, I take back my apology.

50:05.042 --> 50:07.709
Sorry.

50:10.084 --> 50:11.626
Goodbye.

50:15.626 --> 50:19.209
You're like an extinct species,
you know that, don't you?

50:20.292 --> 50:24.042
You could stuff me and put me
in a display cabinet.

50:26.501 --> 50:28.084
That's a good idea.

50:28.209 --> 50:30.459
I could get back
the money you owe me.

50:59.917 --> 51:02.084
Mr. Alfredo, how are you?

51:02.167 --> 51:04.542
- Am I interrupting?
- You never interrupt.

51:04.626 --> 51:07.167
My friend Tomás is visiting me
for a few days.

51:07.209 --> 51:10.292
Mr. Alfredo's the producer of the play,
and the owner of the theater.

51:10.376 --> 51:13.251
- Nice to meet you.
- The theater has no owner, Julián.

51:13.334 --> 51:15.251
Have a seat, please.

51:27.459 --> 51:30.126
I've learned about your disease.

51:31.001 --> 51:33.459
When I was told, one week ago,
I started crying.

51:34.792 --> 51:38.917
And I have no words of comfort.

51:39.001 --> 51:40.084
Thank you.

51:40.209 --> 51:44.126
But I also...

51:44.209 --> 51:47.084
I also got mad at you.

51:47.959 --> 51:50.834
I got mad because I thought

51:50.917 --> 51:53.584
I should've been
the first person to know.

51:54.709 --> 51:57.501
We're friends, aren't we?

51:58.667 --> 52:00.584
Of course.

52:01.376 --> 52:04.459
Who gave you your first job here
in the theater?

52:04.542 --> 52:06.126
You did, Mr. Alfredo.

52:06.209 --> 52:08.959
And back then, nobody was hiring
Argentine actors.

52:09.042 --> 52:10.709
Nobody.

52:10.792 --> 52:13.209
I didn't mean to upset you.

52:14.084 --> 52:18.084
I know, I know...
dear Julián.

52:24.709 --> 52:28.876
Julián, what you need now is rest.

52:30.042 --> 52:34.126
Stay at home,
let others take care of you.

52:34.209 --> 52:38.792
I have to see to it
that this boat stays afloat.

52:38.834 --> 52:42.084
So everyone can get paid
at the end of the month.

52:43.042 --> 52:47.126
It's been very hard
to find someone else.

52:47.167 --> 52:49.709
He won't be as good as you are,

52:49.792 --> 52:52.834
but after some training,
he learned his lines.

52:56.126 --> 52:59.959
We've arranged that he'll start
at the end of the month.

53:00.042 --> 53:02.876
You still have a few days
to say goodbye.

53:09.542 --> 53:11.751
You understand, don't you?

53:18.626 --> 53:20.876
I think of you all the time.

53:36.376 --> 53:38.459
What was that?

53:38.542 --> 53:41.376
I'd say he's just fired you.

53:46.626 --> 53:48.709
Everything's going to hell.

54:15.001 --> 54:16.834
Argentine rock.

54:33.501 --> 54:35.334
- Paula.
- Yes, Paula.

54:35.459 --> 54:39.292
You talk to her, come on.
She wants to get today's report.

54:39.376 --> 54:42.251
You answer...
You two get on well...

54:42.334 --> 54:44.709
Hello... Hello.

55:18.501 --> 55:21.542
Good morning, it's Julián.

55:21.626 --> 55:23.584
Yes, the dog's owner.

55:23.667 --> 55:28.376
No, I wanted to know
what time I could pick him up.

55:29.209 --> 55:30.959
Did he eat?

55:31.042 --> 55:32.459
Yes.

55:32.542 --> 55:35.209
Great, great, no problem.

55:40.709 --> 55:42.417
Oh, I see...

55:44.084 --> 55:47.251
No, that's no problem at all...

55:48.876 --> 55:51.542
Okay, right.

55:51.667 --> 55:52.834
Thank you.

55:52.917 --> 55:54.834
See you tomorrow.

55:56.209 --> 55:58.167
What's wrong?

55:58.251 --> 55:59.334
Nothing, nothing...

55:59.417 --> 56:02.292
They asked if he can stay
for another day.

56:02.376 --> 56:04.667
The Russian boy
got home late yesterday,

56:04.751 --> 56:06.792
they spent very little time
together...

56:06.876 --> 56:09.876
They want to take them
to a park to play today.

56:09.959 --> 56:12.209
Well, that's good, isn't it?

56:12.292 --> 56:14.417
Means things are going well,
it's a good sign.

56:14.459 --> 56:16.917
Yes, I don't know...
I guess.

56:18.542 --> 56:19.667
What do you want to do?

56:19.792 --> 56:23.792
What surprises have you got
lined up for me today?

56:23.876 --> 56:27.751
None, I was going
to pick up Truman and that's it.

56:31.042 --> 56:32.334
How old is your son?

56:34.334 --> 56:36.042
Nico?

56:37.126 --> 56:38.417
Twenty-one.

56:38.501 --> 56:41.167
- He'll be 22 tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

56:41.251 --> 56:44.917
Well, we can ask him to dinner.
Let's celebrate it.

56:45.001 --> 56:46.751
To dinner? When?

56:46.834 --> 56:49.459
Well, today if you want.

56:50.709 --> 56:53.084
If I want... I'd love it but...

56:53.209 --> 56:56.459
If you want to be alone
with him, I can...

56:56.542 --> 56:58.876
No, no,
he'd be glad to see you,

56:58.959 --> 57:01.626
I always quote you as as an example,

57:01.709 --> 57:04.417
I don't know of what, but I do.

57:04.501 --> 57:06.917
We get the tickets online,
don't we?

57:08.876 --> 57:12.251
- What tickets?
- For the plane.

57:12.334 --> 57:13.917
What plane?

57:14.751 --> 57:17.584
Nicolás lives in Amsterdam,
Tomás.

57:17.667 --> 57:18.959
Nico lives in Amsterdam?

57:19.001 --> 57:20.959
Yes, he's studying there,
I told you that.

57:21.042 --> 57:22.251
Well, I didn't remember.

57:22.334 --> 57:25.292
So you want us to go
there for lunch?

57:25.376 --> 57:27.501
It was your idea.

57:27.626 --> 57:32.459
Yes, yes, but I didn't know
he was in Holland.

57:32.542 --> 57:34.667
Well, what's the problem?
It's near, we'll be back soon.

57:34.751 --> 57:37.709
- Yes, sure... What?
- What?

57:37.751 --> 57:41.292
You want us to go there,
have lunch and come back?

57:41.376 --> 57:45.334
- Isn't it a good idea?
- it is, and very original, too.

57:45.417 --> 57:47.626
Hey, you asked me
what I wanted to do.

57:47.709 --> 57:48.751
- Yes.
- I told you...

57:48.834 --> 57:52.417
"I want to go to Amsterdam
to see Nicolás, my son."

57:52.501 --> 57:53.709
I haven't seen him in a while.

57:53.792 --> 57:55.292
- It's his birthday tomorrow.
- Yes.

57:55.376 --> 57:58.126
Plus I'd get out of Madrid,
which will be good for me.

57:58.209 --> 58:02.126
But if it's not true
we can do whatever we want...

58:02.209 --> 58:05.417
- You said we had money.
- That's right.

58:05.501 --> 58:06.709
So...

58:07.959 --> 58:11.167
Don't worry.
I'll go when you leave, that's okay.

58:11.251 --> 58:14.292
We can make some sandwiches
and go to the park to row.

58:14.376 --> 58:16.334
We can rent a rowboat.

58:16.417 --> 58:18.584
We'll have a great time!
Don't worry.

58:35.417 --> 58:37.584
They're not serving anything,
not even coffee or water.

58:37.667 --> 58:39.709
I told you that.

58:39.792 --> 58:42.626
I was about to show them
my test results, maybe that way...

58:45.126 --> 58:47.542
- Have I said thank you?
- Yes, my leg hurts.

58:52.876 --> 58:54.376
How's Nico?

58:55.292 --> 58:58.209
- How's he coping?
- He's better now.

59:00.167 --> 59:02.876
He doesn't talk much
about his feelings...

59:02.959 --> 59:05.376
He's nothing like me in that sense.

59:05.459 --> 59:07.542
But he's fine.

59:08.417 --> 59:10.501
He doesn't know
the whole story anyway.

59:10.584 --> 59:12.667
What doesn't he know?

59:15.542 --> 59:18.292
He thinks the cancer's
under control.

59:19.792 --> 59:21.709
I haven't told him
about this last month,

59:21.792 --> 59:24.251
or that I'm quitting chemo...

59:24.334 --> 59:25.626
What for?
There's no need.

59:25.709 --> 59:28.917
I want him to be calm,
there'll be time to...

59:30.709 --> 59:32.626
What's wrong?
Why do you have that look?

59:32.709 --> 59:33.917
What look?

59:34.001 --> 59:37.084
The one you had,
as when you disagree.

59:37.167 --> 59:39.626
Well, maybe I do disagree,
that's all.

59:39.709 --> 59:41.959
- He's happy now, he's happy...
- I know.

59:42.042 --> 59:44.834
He's with his girlfriend,
living abroad...

59:44.917 --> 59:49.376
He's had a rough year.
What good is it to upset him?

59:49.501 --> 59:54.459
I don't see why people insist
on making others suffer.

59:54.542 --> 59:56.876
He has the right to know it.

59:56.959 --> 01:00:00.001
Did I ask for your opinion?
I don't think so.

01:00:00.084 --> 01:00:01.959
Everyone says what they think,
gives me advice.

01:00:02.084 --> 01:00:04.167
They're all fucking clueless.

01:00:04.251 --> 01:00:07.501
Fuck everyone else.
I paid for the tickets, I'm here.

01:00:07.584 --> 01:00:08.792
I'll give you my opinion if I want to.

01:00:08.876 --> 01:00:12.501
When you're dying,
call me and we'll talk, fuck you!

01:00:21.042 --> 01:00:22.209
Julián.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:30.417
Julián.

01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:33.251
I'm reading, don't bother me
or I'll call the flight attendant.

01:00:35.917 --> 01:00:38.084
Okay, I'm sorry,
you're right.

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:40.167
Each person...

01:00:40.251 --> 01:00:42.292
Each person dies
as best they can.

01:00:44.459 --> 01:00:47.584
So what's the plan?
What did you arrange with Nico?

01:00:47.667 --> 01:00:50.584
Want me to find a restaurant
for lunch?

01:00:50.667 --> 01:00:53.501
To ask about local dishes
to celebrate?

01:00:53.584 --> 01:00:55.917
I don't know,
I haven't heard from him yet.

01:00:57.334 --> 01:00:59.834
What do you mean?
He doesn't know we're coming?

01:00:59.917 --> 01:01:02.959
I guess he does,
I left him another message.

01:01:03.709 --> 01:01:05.042
What if he's not there?

01:01:06.376 --> 01:01:08.459
Why so much trouble?

01:01:08.542 --> 01:01:11.501
It's not that hard
to make sure before...

01:01:11.584 --> 01:01:13.751
Why wouldn't he be there?
He lives there.

01:01:13.834 --> 01:01:16.792
Maybe he's gone away
with his girlfriend, I don't know.

01:01:16.876 --> 01:01:20.292
Maybe they rented some bicycles,
it's common there, and went to Belgium.

01:01:20.376 --> 01:01:22.667
- I don't know, Julián.
- Why don't you go jerk off?

01:01:22.751 --> 01:01:24.709
You're very nervous,
it'll calm you down.

01:01:24.792 --> 01:01:27.167
Go and jerk off.
Do you remember how to do it?

01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:28.334
I can ask the flight attendant for help.

01:01:47.626 --> 01:01:49.084
What are you doing?

01:01:49.167 --> 01:01:51.584
Looking for his boat,
this is the right street,

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:54.584
but I don't know
where his boat is.

01:01:54.709 --> 01:01:57.459
- I think it's this one.
- He lives on a boat?

01:01:57.542 --> 01:01:59.209
Let's see.

01:02:06.709 --> 01:02:09.751
Er... Is Nico home?

01:02:16.501 --> 01:02:17.792
- Shall I translate?
- Please.

01:02:17.876 --> 01:02:20.209
He's not here.
He left early.

01:02:26.501 --> 01:02:28.376
He's left by bike.

01:02:30.334 --> 01:02:31.501
Hello, how are you?

01:02:31.584 --> 01:02:35.292
Hi... Fine.

01:02:35.417 --> 01:02:37.042
Ask him how to get
to the university.

01:02:51.792 --> 01:02:53.834
Where's he going?

01:02:53.917 --> 01:02:55.667
To write down the address.

01:02:55.751 --> 01:02:58.376
He said we can take the tram
right there.

01:03:01.501 --> 01:03:04.084
I bet they spend the whole day
smoking pot,

01:03:04.167 --> 01:03:06.917
listening to music, fucking...
I envy them...

01:03:08.459 --> 01:03:10.376
Being young is the best.

01:03:34.126 --> 01:03:36.834
Maybe we're here for a reason,
you know?

01:03:38.584 --> 01:03:42.292
Maybe you're right and...

01:03:42.334 --> 01:03:45.834
I should tell Nico everything.

01:03:45.917 --> 01:03:47.459
I should.

01:03:50.084 --> 01:03:54.542
Wouldn't it be better
if the two of you were alone?

01:03:54.667 --> 01:03:56.501
You can talk calmly...
I'll say hello but then I leave.

01:03:56.584 --> 01:03:57.667
You have lunch together...

01:03:57.792 --> 01:04:00.376
No, no, I think it'll be good
if you are there.

01:04:00.459 --> 01:04:04.584
I'll signal you when the time comes
and you go to smoke...

01:04:04.667 --> 01:04:05.792
I don't smoke.

01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:09.126
Well, go to the bathroom,
I don't know.

01:04:09.209 --> 01:04:10.959
OK.

01:04:15.709 --> 01:04:19.459
What signal? Like what?
So I don't...

01:04:19.542 --> 01:04:23.709
A gesture. Something simple.

01:04:23.792 --> 01:04:27.126
- Nothing else.
- Okay.

01:04:40.292 --> 01:04:44.459
Nico, have you heard
my messages?

01:04:44.542 --> 01:04:46.876
In Amsterdam, I told you.

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:48.709
Now at the university, exactly.

01:04:48.792 --> 01:04:51.251
I don't know, first floor,
the hall...

01:04:51.334 --> 01:04:53.167
What?
You can see me?

01:04:53.209 --> 01:04:54.417
Where are you?

01:05:03.834 --> 01:05:06.792
Dad, what are you doing here?

01:05:06.876 --> 01:05:08.292
Give me a hug.

01:05:10.209 --> 01:05:14.209
- What's up? What's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing's wrong.

01:05:14.292 --> 01:05:15.917
I've come with Tomás.
Remember Tomás?

01:05:16.042 --> 01:05:17.876
Yes, hello, Tomás.

01:05:17.959 --> 01:05:19.876
He's here in Amsterdam
for a conference,

01:05:19.959 --> 01:05:24.251
and he invited me, I accepted,
and this way I get to see you, too.

01:05:24.334 --> 01:05:25.459
- It's your birthday tomorrow.
- Yes...

01:05:25.501 --> 01:05:28.251
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

01:05:28.334 --> 01:05:31.459
It just came up all of a sudden,
I hadn't planned it before...

01:05:31.542 --> 01:05:33.042
And I wanted to surprise you.

01:05:33.126 --> 01:05:35.292
- I see...
- I left you a message.

01:05:35.376 --> 01:05:38.542
Yes, but surprises...
I don't...

01:05:38.626 --> 01:05:40.501
I haven't heard
the messages either.

01:05:40.584 --> 01:05:42.292
I see.

01:05:42.376 --> 01:05:45.001
Well, I thought
we could go out to lunch,

01:05:45.084 --> 01:05:46.751
for a little celebration.

01:05:46.834 --> 01:05:49.876
Yeah, but I've made plans,
and then I've got an exam.

01:05:49.959 --> 01:05:52.876
And tonight we're going
to a concert...

01:05:54.126 --> 01:05:55.792
If you had called ahead...

01:05:57.709 --> 01:06:01.584
Don't worry, please, that's all right.

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:03.834
We'll hang out for as long as you can.

01:06:03.917 --> 01:06:07.292
Just having seen you is enough for me.
I could head back right now.

01:06:07.376 --> 01:06:08.751
That's it.

01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:13.501
How's Truman?
His leg's better?

01:06:13.584 --> 01:06:15.917
Yes, he's better.

01:06:16.001 --> 01:06:17.834
- Everything's fine.
- Yes?

01:06:17.917 --> 01:06:19.334
Everything's fine.

01:06:20.084 --> 01:06:21.376
I was getting lunch now.

01:06:21.459 --> 01:06:24.917
- If you want something quick.
- Yes. Let's go then.

01:06:25.001 --> 01:06:27.292
Er... Sophie's coming.

01:06:27.376 --> 01:06:29.459
Great.

01:06:29.542 --> 01:06:32.042
In fact, I came here
to meet your girlfriend.

01:06:32.084 --> 01:06:34.834
I already know you.
Let's go.

01:06:51.917 --> 01:06:54.209
What a nice place.

01:06:54.292 --> 01:06:55.501
You always come here?

01:06:55.584 --> 01:06:59.251
Yes, sometimes...
The Wi-Fi...

01:07:03.126 --> 01:07:05.959
- I met Sophie here.
- Did you?

01:07:06.042 --> 01:07:07.959
You like her.

01:07:08.042 --> 01:07:10.834
You're really involved
in the relationship...

01:07:17.751 --> 01:07:20.459
- What's this?
- A gift.

01:07:20.542 --> 01:07:22.917
I couldn't come empty-handed,
could I?

01:07:24.834 --> 01:07:30.001
It's a hip flask... for whisky
or whatever you put in your drinks.

01:07:30.084 --> 01:07:34.042
I used to do that.
Truman chose it.

01:07:34.126 --> 01:07:35.626
Thanks, Dad.

01:07:36.667 --> 01:07:39.167
I don't drink much, but thanks.

01:07:41.209 --> 01:07:42.709
Nico...

01:07:46.292 --> 01:07:47.542
What?

01:07:51.292 --> 01:07:53.834
How's everything going?
Things okay?

01:07:53.917 --> 01:07:55.042
- Yes.
- Really?

01:07:55.126 --> 01:07:57.001
Yes...

01:07:59.667 --> 01:08:01.084
Great.

01:08:07.084 --> 01:08:08.292
Thanks.

01:08:14.126 --> 01:08:15.292
Dad...

01:08:17.042 --> 01:08:22.459
I said all that before,
but I'm glad you came.

01:08:22.501 --> 01:08:24.209
I know.

01:08:45.042 --> 01:08:46.626
I'll carry this.

01:08:51.792 --> 01:08:53.542
What's your conference about?

01:08:53.626 --> 01:08:57.334
- Which one?
- The one you're here for.

01:09:01.792 --> 01:09:03.084
Robotics.

01:09:03.126 --> 01:09:04.167
- Robotics?
- Yes.

01:09:04.251 --> 01:09:08.334
I work for a company in Montreal
which creates prototypes,

01:09:08.376 --> 01:09:10.376
and I teach at university.

01:09:10.417 --> 01:09:13.834
I went to get a doctorate,
and I stayed...

01:09:13.959 --> 01:09:15.042
Watch out.

01:09:15.126 --> 01:09:18.209
Why-- No, I don't think
I'll stay in Amsterdam.

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:21.917
I said that when I went to Madrid,
and how long have I been there?

01:09:22.001 --> 01:09:23.209
Think about it.

01:09:25.209 --> 01:09:27.542
No, I think...

01:09:27.626 --> 01:09:31.251
I'll go live in Buenos Aires
for a while.

01:09:33.084 --> 01:09:35.042
Why?
I didn't know it...

01:09:35.126 --> 01:09:39.834
I've only been there
a couple of times and...

01:09:42.501 --> 01:09:46.751
How long have you had
this plan, this idea?

01:09:50.751 --> 01:09:53.292
For a while now.

01:09:53.376 --> 01:09:54.751
I'll get a smoke.

01:10:18.542 --> 01:10:21.292
Why didn't you tell me
your father was coming?

01:10:21.376 --> 01:10:22.667
I didn't know he was.

01:10:22.792 --> 01:10:25.917
It was a birthday surprise.

01:10:26.001 --> 01:10:29.542
Ah... Do you want to be alone?
Am I interrupting?

01:10:29.584 --> 01:10:30.751
- Not at all.
- No.

01:10:30.834 --> 01:10:33.042
- You're sure?
- Sure.

01:10:33.126 --> 01:10:35.542
I can't smoke these ones...

01:10:35.626 --> 01:10:37.834
Sophie, this is Tomás,
a friend of my father's.

01:10:37.917 --> 01:10:39.459
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:10:40.542 --> 01:10:43.126
- Where are you from?
- Paris.

01:10:43.167 --> 01:10:45.626
Well, let's see.

01:10:45.751 --> 01:10:48.459
Let's order something,
whatever you want, it's on us.

01:10:48.542 --> 01:10:52.501
Will you be here for long?
You can stay on the boat.

01:10:52.584 --> 01:10:56.084
That would be great
but no, thank you, Sophie.

01:10:56.209 --> 01:10:58.167
We're going back
to Madrid today.

01:10:58.292 --> 01:11:01.126
This was a lightning visit,
to see Nico,

01:11:01.209 --> 01:11:04.959
and celebrate his birthday...

01:11:05.001 --> 01:11:06.709
You make a very good couple.

01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:10.167
Very good.

01:11:10.209 --> 01:11:11.292
Okay, Dad.

01:11:11.376 --> 01:11:13.334
No, "Okay, Dad" no,
that's the truth.

01:11:13.417 --> 01:11:16.126
And it's because of her,
she's much cuter than you.

01:11:16.209 --> 01:11:20.501
Although I imagined her differently.
I don't know, more Dutch.

01:11:20.584 --> 01:11:22.334
Dutch?
I told you she was French...

01:11:22.417 --> 01:11:24.042
Yes, but...

01:11:24.126 --> 01:11:27.376
The same happened to me.

01:11:27.501 --> 01:11:32.209
- Really?
- Yes, Nico tells me about you.

01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:36.292
- He talks about me?
- Yes, always.

01:11:36.376 --> 01:11:38.167
That's weird,
he never tells me anything.

01:11:38.251 --> 01:11:41.459
That's why
I had to come to meet you.

01:11:41.542 --> 01:11:43.542
Are you feeling better now?

01:11:43.584 --> 01:11:47.792
Yes, much better.
Thanks for asking.

01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:52.626
Why don't we order some drinks
and have a toast?

01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:54.334
- Yes...
- It's Nico's birthday.

01:11:54.417 --> 01:11:56.209
- That's why we're here.
- Happy birthday.

01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:18.667
When are you coming to Madrid?

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:21.209
When I finish my exams.
You already asked me that.

01:12:21.292 --> 01:12:22.626
Oh, yes.

01:12:23.917 --> 01:12:28.834
Promise me this time
you'll come with Sophie, okay?

01:12:28.917 --> 01:12:32.626
You can stay at my house.
You'll have privacy. I'll go to your mother's.

01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:35.126
I'd like to see that,
you and mom together.

01:12:35.209 --> 01:12:37.084
How much
have you got on you?

01:12:37.167 --> 01:12:39.251
- How much what?
- Euros.

01:12:40.584 --> 01:12:42.251
No, Dad.

01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:44.459
Dad, it's not necessary.

01:12:44.542 --> 01:12:47.042
Yes, yes, it is necessary.

01:12:47.084 --> 01:12:51.209
I haven't sent you money
for weeks... It's necessary.

01:12:51.251 --> 01:12:54.584
You can have dinner
somewhere nice.

01:12:54.667 --> 01:12:57.875
Money's not an issue. He owes me a lot,
I'm always lending him.

01:12:57.959 --> 01:12:59.959
That's true.

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.501
Well, thanks.

01:13:02.584 --> 01:13:05.001
- We have to go.
- Yes.

01:13:05.084 --> 01:13:06.292
- Tomás...
- Bye.

01:13:06.376 --> 01:13:08.334
- Bye.
- It was nice to meet you.

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:10.167
The pleasure is all mine.

01:13:10.251 --> 01:13:13.084
- Look after him for me.
- Yes.

01:13:13.126 --> 01:13:14.542
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:13:14.626 --> 01:13:17.584
Well, it was a short visit,
but it was worth it.

01:13:17.667 --> 01:13:19.376
- Yes.
- Wasn't it?

01:13:21.334 --> 01:13:22.751
Well... We'll see each other
in a few weeks.

01:13:22.834 --> 01:13:24.459
Okay.

01:13:33.292 --> 01:13:35.959
- Your lighter.
- Ah, it's okay...

01:13:52.167 --> 01:13:53.376
Bye.

01:14:12.459 --> 01:14:16.251
I couldn't...
I tried, I did try but...

01:14:16.334 --> 01:14:18.501
It's okay.

01:14:18.626 --> 01:14:20.251
You'll have another chance.

01:14:21.751 --> 01:14:23.376
- Just a minute.
- Where are you going?

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.584
To cry a little... alone...

01:14:26.334 --> 01:14:27.751
I'll be...

01:15:36.376 --> 01:15:37.917
Don't you answer?

01:15:37.959 --> 01:15:40.167
No, it's the theater.

01:15:40.251 --> 01:15:42.376
- You have a show?
- Yes.

01:15:42.459 --> 01:15:46.834
- Did you forget?
- No, I didn't.

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:50.292
But don't worry,
there's no problem.

01:15:50.417 --> 01:15:52.542
They've got somebody else,
don't they?

01:15:52.626 --> 01:15:55.376
I'm sure he'll answer.

01:15:55.459 --> 01:16:00.001
I'm going to get drunk tonight,

01:16:00.084 --> 01:16:04.126
and so are you,
you deserve it.

01:16:05.542 --> 01:16:06.917
Thanks.

01:16:35.917 --> 01:16:37.917
What?

01:16:38.001 --> 01:16:39.292
Nothing.

01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:42.459
All this.

01:16:43.584 --> 01:16:45.001
It's your fault, you know that.

01:16:45.084 --> 01:16:46.292
What?

01:16:46.376 --> 01:16:48.251
Amsterdam, that he's so happy,
all this...

01:16:48.334 --> 01:16:50.126
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:17:40.792 --> 01:17:42.084
When are you leaving?

01:17:42.167 --> 01:17:45.584
Day after next.
Tomorrow's my last day.

01:17:45.667 --> 01:17:47.417
Come over to my place
for dinner.

01:17:47.501 --> 01:17:50.084
I don't want to be alone with him,
I'm fed up with him.

01:17:50.167 --> 01:17:52.459
So am I.

01:17:52.542 --> 01:17:54.709
I'll try but...

01:17:54.792 --> 01:17:57.251
I'll cook, don't worry.

01:17:57.334 --> 01:17:58.751
Then maybe I'll come.

01:17:58.834 --> 01:18:00.126
- Really?
- Yes.

01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:02.542
- Great.
- Okay.

01:18:02.626 --> 01:18:04.584
Well, good night.

01:18:12.376 --> 01:18:14.667
Your vitamins,
don't forget to take them.

01:18:29.917 --> 01:18:31.917
Where are we sleeping tonight,
honey?

01:19:50.501 --> 01:19:52.542
Truman...

01:19:52.626 --> 01:19:54.126
How did the Russians treat you?

01:19:54.209 --> 01:19:56.709
Badly, can't you see
he's swollen, his breath stinks,

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:58.292
I don't know what they gave him.

01:19:58.334 --> 01:20:01.042
You have breakfast here often?

01:20:01.126 --> 01:20:04.626
No, I'm with another candidate,
she's in the restroom.

01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:07.667
She might adopt him.
She phoned this morning, you were snoring.

01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:10.917
It's good to have more options.

01:20:11.001 --> 01:20:12.834
Since the Russian
doesn't want him.

01:20:12.876 --> 01:20:15.001
- He doesn't?
- No.

01:20:15.084 --> 01:20:16.917
Why?
What did they tell you?

01:20:17.001 --> 01:20:21.917
Apparently...
the boy is afraid he'll die.

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:25.459
- The boy is afraid he...
- Yes.

01:20:25.542 --> 01:20:29.834
Yes, because Truman is old...
The boy couldn't take another loss.

01:20:29.959 --> 01:20:32.626
They hadn't considered that,
not even the therapist.

01:20:32.667 --> 01:20:37.584
Now they want a puppy,
or a turtle, a parrot...

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:40.501
What was I saying?

01:20:40.584 --> 01:20:42.542
That your husband
doesn't like dogs.

01:20:42.626 --> 01:20:43.917
Not my husband,
my ex-husband.

01:20:44.001 --> 01:20:45.126
Yes, sorry.

01:20:45.167 --> 01:20:47.126
My friend Tomás. Elena.

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:48.751
Hi.

01:20:48.834 --> 01:20:51.459
Have you got a deck
or a balcony...

01:20:51.542 --> 01:20:54.334
so Truman
can get outside a bit?

01:20:54.417 --> 01:20:56.792
I've got a patio with a tree.
He'll love it.

01:20:56.876 --> 01:21:00.251
- That's good.
- It's not very big but... I love dogs.

01:21:00.334 --> 01:21:02.792
When are you leaving?

01:21:03.667 --> 01:21:05.750
- Where to?
- Canada.

01:21:05.834 --> 01:21:08.792
I told her we're moving
to Montreal in a couple months.

01:21:08.876 --> 01:21:12.251
Perfect, I'd like to fix up
the patio a bit.

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:15.917
When you come to Madrid,
you can always come visit him.

01:21:16.001 --> 01:21:19.459
- Thank you very much.
- You can come to dinner.

01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:21.001
That's very kind of you.

01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:23.542
I'd ordered another beer!
A long time ago!

01:21:23.626 --> 01:21:26.376
Maybe you're deaf?

01:21:26.459 --> 01:21:30.542
- I'll bring it right over.
- I have to go now. Forget it.

01:21:32.292 --> 01:21:34.542
- I've got to run.
- Yes.

01:21:34.667 --> 01:21:37.709
Call me tomorrow or whenever you want,
and you come to see my house.

01:21:37.834 --> 01:21:39.626
I'll call you.
My pleasure.

01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:42.459
Thanks.

01:21:42.542 --> 01:21:43.917
I'll call you in a few days.

01:21:44.042 --> 01:21:45.709
Bye.

01:21:52.042 --> 01:21:54.667
She's a woman, Truman,
you'll get used to it.

01:21:56.501 --> 01:21:59.084
- You must be kidding.
- Why?

01:21:59.126 --> 01:22:03.459
You're not leaving Truman
with that woman.

01:22:03.542 --> 01:22:05.459
What's wrong with her?

01:22:05.542 --> 01:22:08.792
She's a racist, did you see
how she treated the waiter?

01:22:08.876 --> 01:22:11.376
Think about it.

01:22:13.542 --> 01:22:16.459
Yes, I will.

01:22:17.501 --> 01:22:21.417
I don't know what they fed him,
he'll be like this all week. Let's go.

01:22:21.501 --> 01:22:22.667
Can I have the check, please?

01:22:39.792 --> 01:22:42.876
Truman, my friend, how are you?

01:22:50.167 --> 01:22:51.542
Gloria...

01:22:54.542 --> 01:22:57.625
My God...
What a surprise!

01:23:00.209 --> 01:23:02.459
What are you doing here?

01:23:02.542 --> 01:23:03.751
Are you back from Canada?

01:23:03.834 --> 01:23:05.751
No, no...

01:23:05.792 --> 01:23:08.042
I'm just here for a few days.

01:23:08.126 --> 01:23:10.417
I came to see Julián.

01:23:10.501 --> 01:23:12.251
Where is he?

01:23:12.334 --> 01:23:13.667
At the pharmacy.

01:23:13.792 --> 01:23:15.417
Julián didn't tell me
you were coming.

01:23:15.501 --> 01:23:17.209
Well, we don't talk
that often...

01:23:17.251 --> 01:23:20.042
It was a surprise visit...

01:23:20.126 --> 01:23:22.417
- And I'm leaving tomorrow.
- Well, well, well...

01:23:22.459 --> 01:23:25.792
My ex-wife and my best friend
together, what's this?

01:23:25.876 --> 01:23:28.834
Gloria.
How are you?

01:23:28.917 --> 01:23:31.959
Fine, fine...
I spotted Truman here alone...

01:23:33.834 --> 01:23:35.376
Did Nico tell you?

01:23:35.459 --> 01:23:38.042
No, what?

01:23:38.084 --> 01:23:39.792
We were in Amsterdam yesterday.

01:23:39.917 --> 01:23:41.042
We gave him a surprise.

01:23:42.376 --> 01:23:44.667
Really?
You went to see him?

01:23:44.751 --> 01:23:48.542
We couldn't stay long,
because they had an exam,

01:23:48.626 --> 01:23:52.292
but we had a drink,
we had lunch and celebrated...

01:23:52.417 --> 01:23:53.667
We talked.

01:23:55.667 --> 01:23:57.876
I'm glad, Julián.

01:23:57.959 --> 01:24:00.959
That's a weight off my back.
I didn't know how to handle this.

01:24:02.501 --> 01:24:06.001
Nico called me last weekend.
I know you wanted to tell him,

01:24:06.084 --> 01:24:08.542
but he just kept on asking
more and more questions...

01:24:08.626 --> 01:24:10.459
He realized something
was wrong.

01:24:10.542 --> 01:24:12.501
So I told him.

01:24:13.876 --> 01:24:16.084
- Haven't he told you?
- Yes, of course.

01:24:18.209 --> 01:24:22.917
I told him about your decision
so he can be prepared.

01:24:25.917 --> 01:24:29.834
- I'm sorry if...
- No, no. Don't worry.

01:24:29.959 --> 01:24:33.459
We didn't talk so much
because Sophie was there...

01:24:33.542 --> 01:24:36.709
but... everything was fine.

01:24:36.792 --> 01:24:39.917
I'm glad to hear it.
Nico needed to see you.

01:24:40.001 --> 01:24:42.834
He was devastated.
He wanted to call you,

01:24:42.917 --> 01:24:44.917
but he didn't dare to speak
on the phone.

01:24:45.001 --> 01:24:46.542
- I understand.
- You know him.

01:24:46.667 --> 01:24:48.876
He follows
every test you get done.

01:24:54.209 --> 01:24:58.376
Nico promised he'd bring Sophie
to Madrid soon.

01:24:58.459 --> 01:25:00.917
Let's hope so.

01:25:02.917 --> 01:25:07.876
Well... I've got to go,
it was great to see you, Tomás.

01:25:07.959 --> 01:25:10.167
- Take care.
- You too.

01:25:11.084 --> 01:25:13.251
- Call me if you need anything.
- Of course.

01:25:16.292 --> 01:25:17.959
The inseparable friends.

01:25:30.084 --> 01:25:31.292
Come here.

01:25:32.834 --> 01:25:35.667
Julián, let's go.

01:25:50.751 --> 01:25:51.876
Thanks.

01:25:58.709 --> 01:26:00.251
Do you want anything else?

01:26:05.251 --> 01:26:06.501
Are you okay?

01:26:07.459 --> 01:26:09.334
I'm a bit upset.

01:26:10.167 --> 01:26:11.542
Why?

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:14.334
Because you're leaving tomorrow.

01:26:19.417 --> 01:26:21.667
And I won't ever see you again.

01:26:21.751 --> 01:26:24.167
I hate goodbyes,
I'm not going to the airport.

01:26:24.251 --> 01:26:26.376
I want to make it clear.

01:26:26.459 --> 01:26:28.126
I don't want you to come either.

01:26:29.167 --> 01:26:31.751
- Fine, we'll say goodbye on the street.
- Fine.

01:26:31.834 --> 01:26:34.792
You take a taxi and go back
to the North Pole, that's it.

01:26:34.876 --> 01:26:36.209
I think it's a great idea.

01:26:41.917 --> 01:26:46.751
How come I didn't realize,
when he hugged me?

01:26:46.834 --> 01:26:48.417
Why didn't I realize?

01:26:50.501 --> 01:26:51.667
Call him.

01:26:55.709 --> 01:26:56.959
Yes.

01:27:00.417 --> 01:27:01.917
I'll go to the bathroom.

01:27:13.584 --> 01:27:16.084
That was fast,
I thought you went to the bathroom.

01:27:20.584 --> 01:27:22.584
I've just peed on myself.

01:27:28.417 --> 01:27:32.417
It's okay, don't worry,
let's go home.

01:27:32.501 --> 01:27:35.792
I used to be a romantic hero,
Tomás.

01:27:35.876 --> 01:27:37.626
A romantic hero.

01:28:23.459 --> 01:28:27.126
It's delicious, Tomás.
When are you going to learn?

01:28:27.959 --> 01:28:29.876
What for?

01:28:29.959 --> 01:28:32.917
I invite you to dinner
and you never come.

01:28:33.042 --> 01:28:35.209
I never come
because you end up ordering pizza.

01:28:35.292 --> 01:28:38.750
What's wrong with pizza?
It's not any pizza, it's a special one.

01:28:38.834 --> 01:28:41.709
It's this thin and made
in a wood-fired oven.

01:28:41.792 --> 01:28:43.542
It's delicious.

01:28:43.626 --> 01:28:48.417
When we lived together,
he never cooked.

01:28:48.459 --> 01:28:50.459
- I imagine.
- Never.

01:28:56.251 --> 01:28:59.376
Since you're in such a good mood,

01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:01.334
I'll tell you something.

01:29:01.417 --> 01:29:03.876
Oh, here we go.

01:29:04.667 --> 01:29:07.959
- No farewell speeches.
- No. This is not a speech.

01:29:09.542 --> 01:29:11.959
So what is it,
one of your secrets?

01:29:13.751 --> 01:29:16.459
- In a way, yes.
- What secrets?

01:29:19.417 --> 01:29:23.709
Sorry, we're all ears.

01:29:31.084 --> 01:29:36.084
It's just that I've decided
I won't wait until the end.

01:29:36.959 --> 01:29:39.876
- What do you mean?
- Julián...

01:29:42.584 --> 01:29:46.917
Nothing...
It's just that...

01:29:47.001 --> 01:29:51.709
When things start to get ugly,
really ugly,

01:29:51.792 --> 01:29:53.376
I'm going to lie in my bed,
take some pills

01:29:53.459 --> 01:29:56.084
a doctor friend of mine
gets for me, and...

01:29:58.626 --> 01:30:02.417
- That's it, just that.
- Just that?

01:30:02.501 --> 01:30:04.417
Why are you telling me?
I don't understand.

01:30:04.501 --> 01:30:06.584
Why should I know it?

01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:09.876
Screw you, Julián!
You made me come over to hear this?!

01:30:09.959 --> 01:30:14.292
No, no, in fact, I've been meaning
to tell you for a while.

01:30:14.376 --> 01:30:16.417
But it's...

01:30:16.501 --> 01:30:21.459
just ending it all a bit earlier.

01:30:21.584 --> 01:30:26.584
We'll save ourselves
all that damned agony at the end.

01:30:28.001 --> 01:30:30.834
I don't want you
to end up wiping my ass, Paula.

01:30:30.959 --> 01:30:32.751
Not even my son.

01:30:32.834 --> 01:30:35.501
Or worse,
to die in a hospital...

01:30:35.584 --> 01:30:39.709
full of nurses wanting
to get a picture with me.

01:30:41.167 --> 01:30:44.167
Julián, is it because
of what happened today?

01:30:44.251 --> 01:30:46.751
- No...
- What happened today?

01:30:48.751 --> 01:30:51.584
I peed myself.

01:30:51.667 --> 01:30:54.126
So what?

01:30:56.876 --> 01:30:59.751
Okay, maybe I made a mistake,
I'm sorry,

01:30:59.834 --> 01:31:03.167
I shouldn't have told you,
a letter would have been enough.

01:31:03.292 --> 01:31:05.584
You already spoke,
you've already made the mistake,

01:31:05.667 --> 01:31:07.001
don't play martyr now.

01:31:07.084 --> 01:31:08.501
- Paula, please...
- What? I'm tired, too.

01:31:08.584 --> 01:31:10.042
It's hard for me, too.

01:31:10.126 --> 01:31:12.876
- Okay.
- Don't get angry, please.

01:31:14.209 --> 01:31:17.126
I want you to tell me
this is one of your jokes.

01:31:17.209 --> 01:31:18.667
What pills?
I don't understand.

01:31:18.751 --> 01:31:20.751
Some pills...

01:31:23.792 --> 01:31:25.876
Great.

01:31:25.959 --> 01:31:28.376
How long have you been
considering this?

01:31:28.459 --> 01:31:34.376
Since the day I got my test results,
and they told me I was dying.

01:31:34.459 --> 01:31:35.584
Since then, Paula.

01:31:35.667 --> 01:31:38.334
Why don't you just die then
and leave me alone?!

01:31:38.417 --> 01:31:40.084
If that's what you want!

01:31:42.917 --> 01:31:45.209
What about you?
Don't you have anything to say?

01:31:48.251 --> 01:31:50.626
Right, you're just visiting him,
aren't you?

01:31:54.834 --> 01:31:57.876
I'll be here if he wants.

01:31:57.959 --> 01:32:01.501
No, I don't want you to come back.

01:32:01.584 --> 01:32:03.584
I'll do it on my own.

01:32:03.667 --> 01:32:09.167
I wanted you to know
so it didn't catch you unawares.

01:32:09.251 --> 01:32:13.834
Well, I'm glad you told me.

01:32:15.751 --> 01:32:17.376
And I'm glad I came.

01:32:18.251 --> 01:32:21.376
You can go to hell!
Both of you!

01:32:27.501 --> 01:32:29.751
It's our Italian blood.

01:32:30.917 --> 01:32:32.334
She'll be okay.

01:33:33.917 --> 01:33:35.251
You can take it if you want.

01:33:36.834 --> 01:33:38.292
It's mine.

01:33:38.376 --> 01:33:40.292
I know,
that's why I'm telling you.

01:33:42.667 --> 01:33:44.292
What time is your flight tomorrow?

01:33:44.376 --> 01:33:48.667
At... 12:30.

01:33:48.751 --> 01:33:49.834
Okay.

01:33:51.876 --> 01:33:54.042
So I'll come to the hotel at 10:00.

01:34:05.376 --> 01:34:06.709
See you tomorrow.

01:34:07.917 --> 01:34:10.709
They've gone fast...
these four days.

01:34:12.542 --> 01:34:14.959
I feel like we haven't really
talked much,

01:34:15.042 --> 01:34:18.501
and I would have liked...

01:34:23.876 --> 01:34:26.959
Thank you for the envelope.
It's too much money.

01:34:32.167 --> 01:34:34.209
Do you want me to walk Truman?

01:34:34.292 --> 01:34:37.584
No, no, it's not necessary,
thanks.

01:34:38.834 --> 01:34:40.626
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

01:35:04.792 --> 01:35:06.709
- Is Julián at home?
- Of course. Why?

01:35:06.792 --> 01:35:09.917
I thought you were going out,
you have such a great time together.

01:35:10.001 --> 01:35:12.459
- Where are you going?
- I forgot my phone.

01:35:12.542 --> 01:35:14.459
Can you wait a minute, please?

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:17.876
- What for?
- I don't know.

01:35:17.959 --> 01:35:19.917
So we can say goodbye.

01:35:23.209 --> 01:35:25.042
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:35:25.167 --> 01:35:26.917
I'll keep you posted. Or not.

01:35:27.001 --> 01:35:29.542
I don't think you'll like
what's going to happen soon.

01:35:29.626 --> 01:35:31.751
- It's no one's fault.
- No.

01:35:31.834 --> 01:35:33.667
We're all doing the best we can.

01:35:33.751 --> 01:35:35.917
Some more than others.

01:35:36.001 --> 01:35:38.876
Don't try to make me feel guilty,
because you won't succeed.

01:35:38.917 --> 01:35:40.584
- I'm sure of that.
- You know why?

01:35:40.667 --> 01:35:42.709
I have no idea.

01:35:42.792 --> 01:35:45.917
Because I'm proud of Julián,
I'm proud of him.

01:35:46.042 --> 01:35:49.376
How nice,
have you told him that?

01:35:49.459 --> 01:35:51.376
No, I couldn't.

01:35:53.501 --> 01:35:56.251
I tried, but I couldn't.

01:35:56.334 --> 01:35:57.834
I would have started crying.

01:35:57.917 --> 01:35:59.292
Heaven forbid!

01:36:02.959 --> 01:36:05.042
Let's not part like this.

01:36:06.167 --> 01:36:07.709
We don't deserve it.

01:36:13.459 --> 01:36:15.417
Shall we go up to your room?

01:36:17.792 --> 01:36:19.001
Yes.

01:39:35.542 --> 01:39:38.000
Truman, come here.

01:40:28.834 --> 01:40:30.292
Makes sense.

01:40:33.542 --> 01:40:35.917
- I left my phone at your house.
- Yes, I noticed.

01:40:36.042 --> 01:40:38.834
- Have you called a cab?
- No, we're taking my car.

01:40:38.876 --> 01:40:40.792
- Yes?
- Yes.

01:42:15.834 --> 01:42:18.334
Will you wait or...?

01:42:18.417 --> 01:42:19.584
Shall we say goodbye here?

01:42:19.667 --> 01:42:21.334
- Yes.
- It's a good place.

01:42:30.251 --> 01:42:32.209
- We'll keep in touch.
- Sure.

01:42:38.501 --> 01:42:39.834
Here.

01:42:40.626 --> 01:42:42.042
And also this.

01:42:42.834 --> 01:42:46.751
- What?
- These are Truman's papers.

01:42:46.834 --> 01:42:49.084
And his ticket.

01:42:49.167 --> 01:42:53.626
I talked to the company to see
if he could travel with you,

01:42:53.751 --> 01:42:56.417
but he's too big,
he has to go in the cargo hold.

01:42:56.501 --> 01:43:00.459
They assured me
you'll get a container for dogs.

01:43:00.501 --> 01:43:04.417
They'll take him
when you check in.

01:43:04.501 --> 01:43:06.459
These are...

01:43:07.334 --> 01:43:10.334
all the vaccinations he's received
over the years, his tests, everything.

01:43:10.459 --> 01:43:12.251
And this one.

01:43:12.334 --> 01:43:16.917
This one is really important,
I did it this morning.

01:43:17.001 --> 01:43:21.459
The vet certifies that Truman
does not have rabies.

01:43:21.542 --> 01:43:25.501
This is vital. They'll ask for this
at customs in Canada.

01:43:25.584 --> 01:43:27.417
Understand?

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:29.584
- Here.
- Julián...

01:43:29.667 --> 01:43:34.876
I gave him some pills this morning,
which will relax him.

01:43:34.959 --> 01:43:39.126
Don't worry if he drools
or looks half drunk.

01:43:39.209 --> 01:43:40.542
It's okay.

01:43:43.376 --> 01:43:48.084
Give him a bath when you get home.
That will be good for him.

01:43:49.501 --> 01:43:53.334
And tell your Viking children
to treat him well, okay?

01:43:55.542 --> 01:43:56.751
Please.

01:44:01.876 --> 01:44:03.376
Truman.

01:44:16.876 --> 01:44:18.917
Please, go.
