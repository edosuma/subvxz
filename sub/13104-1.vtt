OF BRINGING THAT IN THERE.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.046
IF YOU'RE DRINKING COFFEE,
YOU'RE NOT TAKING NOTES.

03:12.090 --> 03:14.558

FRANK WANTS 15 TO RUN
LIKE A WELL-OILED MACHINE.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.022
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.094
HOW DO YOU TAKE IT?

03:25.130 --> 03:26.358
PERSONALLY.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.061

03:40.350 --> 03:42.887
ESPECIALLY SINCE
WE'RE DOWN AN OFFICER.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.616
I'D ALSO LIKE TO CONGRATULATE
THE NEW FACES OF 15--

03:45.650 --> 03:48.380
TWO OFFICERS HANDPICKED

03:48.420 --> 03:50.422
TO REPRESENT 15

03:50.460 --> 03:53.258
TOUGH, PROFESSIONAL--

03:53.300 --> 03:55.052
THESE OFFICERS
PLAY BY THE RULES.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.829
THEY DON'T LET THEIR
PERSONAL LIFE GET IN THE WAY

03:56.870 --> 03:58.963

03:59.970 --> 04:02.939
DIAZ, STAND UP.

04:04.670 --> 04:05.898
FIERCE, DIAZ! YOU'RE FIERCE.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.808
OH, NOT WITH THOSE CHEEKBONES.
(laughter)

04:08.840 --> 04:12.173
DON'T LISTEN TO THEM, DIAZ.
IT'S A GREAT HONOR.

AND THEN
WE ARE GONNA HAVE...
(Dov and Traci) THE TALK!

04:56.260 --> 04:57.625
DON'T LISTEN TO THEM.

04:57.660 --> 04:58.957
(laughing)
OKAY, THEY'RE JEALOUS.

04:58.990 --> 05:00.059
THEY'RE SMART-ASSES.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.522
THEY WISH THAT THEY HAD
HAD MY TALK.

05:04.030 --> 05:05.998
HEY, DAD. YEAH.

05:06.030 --> 05:07.895

(normal voice)
GREAT. THANK YOU.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.541
SO WHERE IS IT, LIKE THE CLOSET,

05:16.580 --> 05:18.377
NO. I JUST WANT EVERYTHING

05:18.410 --> 05:20.014
I DON'T WANT TO MESS
ANYTHING UP.

YEAH.

05:40.870 --> 05:42.667
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

05:42.710 --> 05:45.668
WHAT DOES A PERSON
BUY IN NORTH BAY?

05:45.710 --> 05:47.337
CAMPING GEAR.
I MEAN, SLEEPING BAGS.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.507
THERE'S A LOT OF
GREAT STUFF IN FLEECE.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.506
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME?

05:51.550 --> 05:53.745
YOU KNOW, I TOLD YOU
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS DOING.

05:53.780 --> 05:56.681
I CALLED YOU.
I E-MAILED YOU BEFORE I LEI-T.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.642
I MEAN, I COULDN'T CONTACT YOU
DURING THE SUSPENSION.

05:58.690 --> 06:00.317
I-I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.987
YOU KNOW? I DIDN'T--

06:02.020 --> 06:03.624
I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW NOT TO SEE YOU.

06:03.660 --> 06:05.582
SO YOU RAN AWAY
TO TEMAGAMI?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.591
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.988
DO YOU MIND? I HAVEN'T
USED ONE LIKE THIS.

06:12.030 --> 06:13.338
(radio chatter)

06:13.370 --> 06:15.258
YEP. FILL YOUR BOOTS.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.336

06:20.240 --> 06:21.673
(buttons clicking)

06:21.710 --> 06:22.847
(man) 1503 to Dispatch.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.643
Could I get a radio check here?

06:24.680 --> 06:26.944
HOW LONG WERE YOU
OVER THERE, ANYWAY?

06:26.980 --> 06:29.016
FOUR YEARS.

06:29.050 --> 06:30.517
WOW.

06:30.550 --> 06:34.213
WELL, YOU GET USED
TO ANYTHING, RIGHT?

06:34.260 --> 06:35.989
(radio static)

06:36.020 --> 06:37.556
YOU PROBABLY THINK
THIS IS GONNA BE A BREEZE.

06:37.590 --> 06:39.182
NO, SIR. I DO NOT.

06:39.230 --> 06:40.925
GOOD.

06:40.960 --> 06:41.949
DO YOU LIKE LEMONADE?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.218
(radio chatter)
WAS THAT THE TALK?

06:44.270 --> 06:46.932
NO, THAT'S NOT THE TALK.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.164
I DON'T SEE
WHY YOU'RE WORRIED.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.098
BECAUSE I WANT TO BE
DETECTIVE.

06:53.140 --> 06:55.176
I WANT THIS ROTATION.
(Inhales sharply)

06:55.210 --> 06:57.770
I'VE BEEN BUSTING MY ASS
ALL YEAR FOR IT.
SO YOU'RE GOOD.

06:57.810 --> 07:01.519
YEAH, BUT GOOD
DOESN'T MAKE ME GAIL.

07:01.550 --> 07:04.485
LITTLE KISS-ASS, VOLUNTEERING
TO WORK WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

07:07.020 --> 07:09.181
WHOA. DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?

07:09.220 --> 07:11.222
(switch clicks, siren wailing)

07:11.260 --> 07:12.921
STILL GIVES ME
THAT RUSH.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.497
THAT'S LAME.
NOT IF YOU ADMIT IT.

07:15.530 --> 07:17.919
(siren continues wailing)

07:17.970 --> 07:19.892
SO WHERE YOU HEADED?
HOME.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.737
GOT TRIBUNAL AT 4:00,
SO I FIGURED

07:21.770 --> 07:24.238
I'D TAKE A SHOWER
AND PRACTICE MY SPEECH.

07:24.270 --> 07:26.773
YOUR SPEECH. WHAT DO YOU GOT?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?

07:26.810 --> 07:28.607
(radio chatter)
THE TRUTH.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.176
OKAY, OFFICER MCNALLY,

07:30.210 --> 07:32.849
THREE MONTHS SUSPENSION
FOR CONDUCT UNBECOMING.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.347
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED?

07:34.380 --> 07:37.349
"I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON.
THE HARD WAY.

07:37.390 --> 07:40.279
"AND I HAVE FOLLOWED
EVERY RULE OF THE SUSPENSION

07:40.320 --> 07:41.582
"TO THE LETTER,

07:41.620 --> 07:43.679
"AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO
IF YOU REINSTATE ME.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.584
"I AM HERE TO KEEP
MY EMOTIONS IN CHECK,

07:45.630 --> 07:48.349
"TO PROTECT AND SERVE,
BECAUSE THAT IS MY JOB,

07:48.400 --> 07:50.618
AND GOD KNOWS
I LOVE MY JOB."

07:50.670 --> 07:53.138
(radio chatter)
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD
SPEECH.

07:53.170 --> 07:55.832
(radio static)
1505, we got a green sedan

07:55.870 --> 07:58.100
HEADING 80 DOWN EASTERN
TOWARDS PARKWAY.
(Siren walling)

07:58.140 --> 08:00.233
DRIVER WON'T STOP
FOR POLICE.

08:01.710 --> 08:03.644
(female dispatcher)
1521, are you 10-8?

08:03.680 --> 08:05.079
(clicks)

08:05.110 --> 08:07.340
1521, MARK ME ON THAT.

08:07.380 --> 08:08.813
(switch clicks,
siren wailing)

08:08.850 --> 08:10.147
Copy that, 1521.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.715
SO WHAT? WHAT DID YOU SAY
IN YOUR SPEECH?

08:12.760 --> 08:15.479
OH, IT WAS GREAT.
I BLAMED SAM‘LL ON YOU.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.852
I TOLD THEM MY PERSONAL LIFE
WAS NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS,

08:17.890 --> 08:20.029
AND IT HAD NOT GOTTEN
IN THE WAY OF ME DOING MY JOB.

08:20.060 --> 08:22.153
SAME THING I TOLD YOU
THREE MONTHS AGO.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.191
YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT

JUST HURRY THIS ALONG,

16:23.680 --> 16:25.568
YEAH, I COULD GO FASTER,

16:25.610 --> 16:27.874
BREATHING THROUGH MY NOSE.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.040
(distant beep)

CAUSED A 4-CAR ACCIDENT,

16:56.680 --> 16:58.238

16:58.280 --> 17:00.578
THE VAN DRIVER'S AWAKE,
BUT HE'S IN SURGERY.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.247
HE FRACTURED HIS PELVIS.

17:02.280 --> 17:05.989
BUT AT LEAST HE'S ALIVE.
DIDN'T DIE OF SMOKE INHALATION.

17:06.020 --> 17:08.079
SMOKE INHALA--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SM--

17:08.120 --> 17:09.519
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SMOKE INHALATION?

17:09.560 --> 17:11.551
THE VAN YOU HIT
WENT UP IN FLAMES.

17:11.590 --> 17:15.890
OH, MY GOD. DID SHE--

17:15.930 --> 17:17.989

THE VAN! THE GIRL IN THE VAN!

17:19.630 --> 17:21.837
THERE WAS NO GIRL IN THE VAN,

17:33.180 --> 17:34.317
YOU WERE IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

17:34.350 --> 17:36.739
YOU WERE DISORIENTED
AND CLEARLY DRUNK.

17:36.780 --> 17:38.247
ALL RIGHT, HENRY.

17:38.290 --> 17:41.487
I NEED YOU TO BREATHE
INTO THIS LITTLE TUBE.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.385

17:49.030 --> 17:50.361
YEAH, WELL, IT'S DUMB.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.129
WELL, DON'T CALL ME THEN.

17:52.170 --> 17:53.432
Hey, are you still
at the hospital?

17:53.470 --> 17:56.098
MM-HMM. I JUST UPDATED
OFFICER NASH.

17:56.140 --> 17:57.937
OKAY. I NEED YOU TO STAY
ON THE VAN DRIVER.

17:57.970 --> 18:00.803
YOU HEAR ANYTHING,

Okay. Why?

18:00.840 --> 18:02.808
BECAUSE THE GUY HAD A GIRL

18:03.910 --> 18:05.309
WHAT'S THE GUY'S NAME?

18:05.350 --> 18:07.272

YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY LUCKY?

18:22.260 --> 18:25.491
THAT THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE
IN THE CAR WITH YOU.

18:25.530 --> 18:27.464

YOUR NOSE CLEAN TILL NOW,

18:34.910 --> 18:36.468
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING.

18:36.510 --> 18:40.810

19:05.310 --> 19:07.130

YOU KNOW, I... NEVER
STAND UP HERE, RIGHT?
(clicks and beeps)

19:11.980 --> 19:13.311
YOU SHOULD TRY IT SOME TIME.

19:13.350 --> 19:16.478
MAKES YOU LOOK
REALLY AUTHORITATIVE.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.987
OFFICER, WE'RE READY

19:20.150 --> 19:21.481
HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:21.520 --> 19:23.158
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS
TO ME?

19:23.190 --> 19:24.555

19:24.590 --> 19:26.126

19:36.940 --> 19:39.465
HOLD--WAIT.
WAIT HERE, OKAY?

19:39.510 --> 19:40.977

OKAY?

19:42.840 --> 19:44.944
OH, COME ON--

19:48.520 --> 19:50.647

19:50.690 --> 19:52.214

20:01.430 --> 20:02.988
(taps on glass)
HEY.

20:03.030 --> 20:05.225
HOLY...
DID YOU SEE A CAT
COME RUNNING PAST HERE?

20:05.270 --> 20:06.862
ORANGE AND WHITE.
NO.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.039
NO?
NO.

20:09.070 --> 20:10.662
(sighs) EVERY TIME IT
GETS OUT, IT'S LIKE A DAY

20:10.710 --> 20:12.268
BEFORE I CAN FIND HIM.
I DON'T EVEN LIKE CATS.

20:12.310 --> 20:13.379
WHY DO YOU HAVE ONE?

20:13.410 --> 20:16.299
UH, IT'S MY GIRLFRIEND'S.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.841

20:17.880 --> 20:19.108
YEAH. YOU KNOW DOUG CORBO?

20:19.150 --> 20:20.515
(chuckles)

20:20.550 --> 20:22.347
NICE OF YOU GUYS
TO FINALLY SHOW UP.

20:22.380 --> 20:25.144
I'VE CALLED LIKE TEN TIMES
ABOUT THIS GUY.

20:25.190 --> 20:26.942
YOU KNOW, AT FIRST
IT WAS JUST NOISE COMPLAINTS

20:26.990 --> 20:30.619
BECAUSE HE PLAYS THIS GOD-AWFUL
SPEED METAL AT 3:00 A.M.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.059
THEN THERE'S THE DRILLING
AND THE HAMMERING

20:32.090 --> 20:33.318
ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.793
BUT THE WORST THING
IS THIS FENCE.

20:34.830 --> 20:36.457
HE BUILT THIS
WITHOUT A PERMIT,

20:36.500 --> 20:38.161
AND IT'S 6 INCHES ON MY SIDE
OF THE PROPERTY LINE.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.667
I HAVE A SURVEY, YOU KNOW.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.133
THE GUY'S A TOTAL FREAK.

20:41.170 --> 20:42.831
I WISH I WOULDN'T HAVE
COMPLAINED ABOUT THE NOISE NOW,

20:42.870 --> 20:45.430
'CAUSE HE STAYS UP ALL NIGHT
NOW SOUNDPROOFING THE HOUSE.

20:45.470 --> 20:48.132
DOES HE, UH,
HAVE A DAUGHTER?

20:48.180 --> 20:50.034
NO, NOT THAT I'VE SEEN.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.502
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HIM
WITH A YOUNG GIRL?

20:51.550 --> 20:53.040
14, 15?

20:53.080 --> 20:54.217
NO, THERE'S ONLY LITTLE KIDS
ON THE STREET,

20:54.250 --> 20:56.241
NO ONE THAT AGE.
I THINK HE LIVES ALONE.

20:56.280 --> 20:57.941
HOW ABOUT THIS, UH--
THIS MORNING?

20:57.990 --> 21:00.618
DID YOU, UH--DID YOU
SEE HIM THIS MORNING?

21:00.660 --> 21:02.878
NO. I WAS AT WORK ALL DAY,
AND I THINK HE SLEEPS IN LATE.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.024
IS HE IN SOME SORT OF TROUBLE?

21:05.060 --> 21:07.790
UH, WE DON'T KNOW YET.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.855
AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO HAS THE CREEPS?

21:09.900 --> 21:13.495
MCNALLY, UH, WE'RE NOT
THE TASTE POLICE, YOU KNOW?

21:13.540 --> 21:15.963
YEAH, BUT THERE'S BARS
ON THE WINDOW, YOU KNOW?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.558
THERE'S--THERE'S
LOCKS ON THE SHED.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.430
WEIRDLY HIGH FENCES.

21:19.470 --> 21:21.131
I MEAN, HE'S SOUNDPROOFING,
SAM.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.977
I MEAN, SHE WAS IN THE BACK
OF WE VAN.

21:23.010 --> 21:24.978
SHE OBVIOUSLY
WASN'T A PASSENGER.
DON'T KNOW THAT.

21:25.010 --> 21:26.773
THEN WHY WOULD SHE
RUN AWAY FROM THE SCENE?
OKAY, LET'S--

21:26.810 --> 21:28.471
SHE'S AFRAID!
LET'S FIND OUT
WHEN WE FIND HER

21:28.520 --> 21:30.249
AND ASK HER.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.679

21:31.720 --> 21:33.813
HELLO? (sighs) HELLO.

21:33.860 --> 21:35.953
HEY, YEAH, YO.

21:46.500 --> 21:47.967
SHE ASKED TO USE THE PHONE,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.365
THEN SHE STOOD OUTSIDE
FOR A WHILE.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.607
I FIGURED SHE WAS
WAITING FOR SOMEONE.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.938
WHERE?

21:53.980 --> 21:57.029

DID ANY VEHICLE
STOP OUTSIDE

22:03.520 --> 22:04.748
WHILE SHE WAITING?

22:04.790 --> 22:06.542
A CAR OR A VAN?

22:06.590 --> 22:08.979
I WASN'T REALLY LOOKING.
SORRY.

22:09.020 --> 22:11.488

22:11.530 --> 22:12.758

22:12.790 --> 22:14.724
HANG ON ONE SECOND,

22:34.450 --> 22:37.146
(radio chatter)
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S THE GIRL?

22:37.180 --> 22:38.909
I DIDN'T SEE HER.
SHE SAW HER.
IT'S THE SAME GIRL.

22:38.950 --> 22:40.508

23:31.640 --> 23:33.733
NO, NO, NO.
SAM'S RIGHT. PECK.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.532
YEAH--UM, YEAH, I'M ON IT.
I'M ON IT.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.507
SO, UH, WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW
ABOUT DOUG CORBO,

23:39.550 --> 23:40.949
BESIDES THE FACT
THAT HE'S A ROOFER?

23:40.980 --> 23:42.345
AND HE LIKES TO DRIVE AROUND
IN HIS VAN

23:42.380 --> 23:43.642
WITH LITTLE GIRLS
IN THE BACK.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.681
UH, NOTHING SERIOUS.
NO OFFENSES.

23:45.720 --> 23:49.417
A COUPLE OF SPEEDING TICKETS.
35, SINGLE, OWNS HIS OWN HOUSE.

23:49.460 --> 23:50.449
ANY NOISE COMPLAINTS?

23:50.490 --> 23:52.185
NO.

23:52.230 --> 23:54.323
(Jerry) SEVEN YEARS AGO,
WHO WERE WE LOOKING AT?

23:54.360 --> 23:56.055
THERE WAS FAMILY, RELATIVES.

23:56.100 --> 23:57.328
WHO WAS WITH HER
WHEN SHE GOT PICKED UP?

23:57.360 --> 23:58.622
IT WAS THE GRANDFATHER.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.467
BUT WE CLEARED HIM.
HE WAS NEVER A SUSPECT.

24:00.500 --> 24:01.728
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

24:01.770 --> 24:04.762
HARRY.
MCLEOD, I'M GUESSING.

24:04.810 --> 24:07.062
HENRY. HENRY MCLEOD.

24:07.110 --> 24:09.408
WHAT?
I KNEW I'D SEEN HIM.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.544
HE'S HERE.
HE'S IN THE STATION.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.177
EPSTEIN, HENRY MCLEOD--
WHERE IS HE?

24:16.220 --> 24:17.687
UH, HE'S IN A CELL.
WE BOOKED HIM.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.847
WE'RE WAITING FOR A JUDGE.

24:21.860 --> 24:26.149
(man Speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

24:26.190 --> 24:29.819
(sighs) THAT'S HIM.

24:29.860 --> 24:31.999
(clicks tongue and sighs)
WELL,

24:32.030 --> 24:34.999
YOU WORKED THE ORIGINAL CASE.
YOU WANT TO TAKE IT?

24:35.040 --> 24:36.496
YOU SURE?

24:36.540 --> 24:39.168
YEAH. YOU KNEW THE DAUGHTER.
MIGHT HELP.

24:39.210 --> 24:40.507
OKAY.

24:40.540 --> 24:42.178
OKAY.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.498
(door buzzes and beeps)

24:47.980 --> 24:49.641
HENRY...

24:49.680 --> 24:51.819
(filtered voice) WE NEED TO KNOW
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TODAY.

24:51.850 --> 24:53.715
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

24:53.760 --> 24:56.320
BOOK ME, DON'T BOOK ME,
LET ME GO--

24:56.360 --> 24:57.452
JUST DO SOMETHING,

24:57.490 --> 24:58.957
THAT'S WHAT I HATE
ABOUT YOU GUYS--

24:58.990 --> 25:01.026
ALL THE DITHERING,
SITTING ON YOUR DAMN HANDS.

25:01.060 --> 25:02.891
I KNEW YOUR DAUGHTER,
ALICE'S MOTHER,

25:02.930 --> 25:04.488
AND I'VE MET YOU BEFORE.

25:04.530 --> 25:06.589
I WORKED ALICE'S CASE
FOR FIVE MONTHS.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.598
THEN YOU'RE AS USELESS
AS I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.904
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME,

25:10.940 --> 25:12.908
TALK TO HIM.
HE WASN'T THERE.

25:12.940 --> 25:15.238
HE DIDN'T SCREW IT UP.
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE STORY.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.508
EVERYBODY KNOWS
THE STORY.

25:16.540 --> 25:18.405
UH, ACTUALLY, I-I DON'T,
UH, EXACTLY--

25:18.450 --> 25:20.816
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
MY GRANDDAUGHTER.

25:22.350 --> 25:25.217
ALICE. 8 YEARS OLD.
LOVE OF MY LIFE.

25:27.590 --> 25:29.717
I TOOK HER TO THE FAIR.

25:30.490 --> 25:33.948
WE HAD ICE CREAM.
SHE RODE A PONY.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.820
I...

25:38.770 --> 25:41.898
(exhales) I LOST HER.

25:41.940 --> 25:43.931
WHEN?

25:43.970 --> 25:46.859
SEVEN YEARS AGO
LAST MONTH.

25:46.910 --> 25:49.629
SEVEN YEARS...

25:49.680 --> 25:52.376
OF LOOKING, HOPING,
NOT HOPING.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.948
HER MOTHER--

25:58.990 --> 26:02.482
MY DAUGHTER--
NEVER FORGAVE ME.

26:02.520 --> 26:06.752
SHE--SHE TRIED, BUT, UH...
OH...

26:08.260 --> 26:11.024
SO I DRIVE EVERY DAY.

26:13.770 --> 26:16.591
AND I DRIVE.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.733
ABOUT A YEAR AGO, I--

26:18.770 --> 26:23.070
I STARTED TAKING A BOTTLE
OF WHISKEY WITH ME FOR COMPANY.

26:23.110 --> 26:24.702
AND TODAY?

26:24.750 --> 26:26.900
I SAW HER.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.443
AT LEAST I THOUGHT I DID.

26:30.950 --> 26:33.339
I WAS DRIVING BY A CORNER STORE
ON WALLACE,

26:33.390 --> 26:35.017
AND SHE WAS STANDING THERE.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.755
AND THEN SHE GOT INTO
THE BACK OF THE VAN.

26:36.790 --> 26:39.725
THE GUY TOOK OFF,
AND I TRIED TO STOP HIM!

26:46.730 --> 26:49.995
BUT I WAS WRONG, OKAY?
I ADMIT IT. ALL RIGHT?

26:50.040 --> 26:53.669
ONE OF OUR OFFICERS THINKS
SHE MAY HAVE SEEN A GIRL

26:53.710 --> 26:55.109
IN THE BACK OF THAT VAN.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.608
SEE, THIS IS FUN.

27:02.650 --> 27:04.686
YOU AND ME WORKING TOGETHER,
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.085
EXCEPT NOT.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.883
LESS TALKING,
MORE WALKING, PLEASE.

27:07.920 --> 27:11.481
IT'S ROOM 313.
GUY JUST GOT OUT OF SURGERY.

27:11.530 --> 27:13.589
(respirator hissing)
(knock on door)

27:13.630 --> 27:15.052
(radio chatter)

27:15.100 --> 27:16.590
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA
GET HIS DETAILS,

27:16.630 --> 27:18.723
BUT WE'RE STILL WAITING
FOR THE DETECTIVE TO ARRIVE.

27:18.770 --> 27:20.761
HE'S STILL PRETTY GROGGY.
HOW LONG DO YOU NEED?

27:20.800 --> 27:23.337
THE GUY'S A SUSPECT
IN A CHILD ABDUCTION.

27:23.370 --> 27:25.201
OKAY THEN.
HE'S ALL YOURS.

27:26.610 --> 27:28.077
HEY!
(kicks twice)

27:28.110 --> 27:29.771
MR. CORBO,
HOW YOU FEELING?

27:29.810 --> 27:31.072
(monitor beeping)

27:31.110 --> 27:32.873
I'VE HAD BETTER MORNINGS.

27:32.910 --> 27:34.446
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT
ALICE MCLEOD.

27:34.480 --> 27:35.913
WHO'S THAT?

27:35.950 --> 27:37.417
WHAT, YOU--YOU LOCK UP
A GIRL,

27:37.450 --> 27:38.883
YOU PUT HER IN THE BACK
OF YOUR VAN,

27:38.920 --> 27:40.683
AND YOU DON'T EVEN BOTHER
TO ASK HER NAME?

27:40.720 --> 27:42.483
WHOA, WHOA. WHAT?

27:42.520 --> 27:43.726
I DIDN'T--
WHO IS SHE TO YOU?

27:43.760 --> 27:45.079
(radio chatter)

27:45.130 --> 27:48.918
HER NAME IS EDEN.
SHE LIVES NEXT DOOR. I--

27:48.960 --> 27:51.667
I-I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
I WAS TRYING TO HELP HER OUT.

27:51.700 --> 27:53.167
SHE CALLED ME THIS MORNING

27:53.200 --> 27:54.838
SAYING SHE NEEDED
TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

27:54.870 --> 27:56.098
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

27:56.140 --> 27:57.869
YEAH. HOW'D SHE GET
YOUR NUMBER?

27:57.910 --> 28:00.208
IT'S--IT'S ON THE SIDE
OF MY VAN.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.504
THE REASON WHY SHE WAS
IN THE BACK

28:02.540 --> 28:04.246
WAS 'CAUSE SHE WOULDN'T
SIT IN THE FRONT.

28:04.280 --> 28:05.747
SHE WAS AFRAID HER DAD
WAS GONNA SEE HER.

28:05.780 --> 28:06.974
WHY'D SHE GO TO THE HOSPITAL?

28:07.010 --> 28:09.911
WELL... SHE SAID HER
STOMACH WAS HURTING.

28:09.950 --> 28:12.680
YOU KNOW, LIKE... CRAMPS.

28:12.720 --> 28:16.508
I THOUGHT MAYBE, YOU KNOW,
SHE WAS PREG-PREGNANT.

28:16.560 --> 28:17.879
DID YOU TOUCH HER?

28:17.930 --> 28:19.784
NO. N-NO!

28:19.830 --> 28:21.627
I S--I SWEAR! I--

28:21.660 --> 28:23.150
I'VE BARELY EVER SEEN HER.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.395
I-I--HER DAD KEEPS HER
IN THE HOUSE ALL THE TIME.

28:25.430 --> 28:27.591
I-I FEEL SORRY FOR HER.

28:27.630 --> 28:29.234
SO WHAT'S HER FATHER'S NAME?

28:29.270 --> 28:31.568
JOHN... SOMETHING.

28:31.610 --> 28:34.670
(rustling)
UH, JOHN THE NEIGHBOR.
I-I DON'T KNOW.

28:34.710 --> 28:36.234
(cell phone dialing)

28:36.280 --> 28:37.907
PLEASE.
TELL ME SHE'S OKAY.

28:39.480 --> 28:42.074
THAN KS.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.213
VAN DRIVER SAYS
SHE LIVES WITH THE NEIGHBOR.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.218
JOHN GRAY,
39 MCKENNA AVENUE.

28:46.250 --> 28:47.649
I WAS RIGHT THERE.
WE TALKED TO THE GUY.

28:47.690 --> 28:49.817
HE WAS COMPLAINING
ABOUT A...

28:49.860 --> 28:51.851
HE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT
A 10-YEAR-OLD FENCE.

28:51.890 --> 28:53.152
DAMN IT!
WE WERE RIGHT THERE!

28:53.190 --> 28:55.658
WE DON'T KNOW IT'S HIM.
IT'S HIM!

28:55.700 --> 28:56.758
UH, NOPE.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.667
WHAT? WHAT?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

28:59.700 --> 29:01.531
YEAH, I'M SERIOUS, ANDY.
IT'S ALMOST 4:00,

29:01.570 --> 29:02.992
AND WE NEED YOU
BACK ON THE JOB.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.838

HEY. HEY. WE GOT IT.

HE'S GONE!

29:29.260 --> 29:30.898
(holsters gun)

29:30.930 --> 29:32.397
(mutters indistinctly)

29:32.430 --> 29:34.898
WELL, HE KNEW
WE'D FIGURE IT OUT.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.909
(cat meowing)

29:37.940 --> 29:40.408
(meowing continues)
WELL, AT LEAST
HE DIDN'T KILL THE CAT.

29:40.440 --> 29:42.704
BRIGHT SIDE.
(meows)

29:42.740 --> 29:44.298
(rattling)

29:44.350 --> 29:45.942
POLICE!

30:01.460 --> 30:04.361

30:07.570 --> 30:09.458
(Chris) WHO IS THIS?
THIS IS DETECTIVE JERRY BARBER

30:09.500 --> 30:11.229
FROM 15 DIVISION.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.409
YEAH, THE WARRANT'S ON ITS WAY,
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO WAIT.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.908
WE GOT A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL
MISSING.

30:15.940 --> 30:17.237
YEAH.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.305
OH. IT'S THE PHONE COMPANY.

30:19.350 --> 30:20.749
THEY'RE GONNA PUT YOU THROUGH

30:20.780 --> 30:22.748
TO THE LAST NUMBER
THAT JOHN GRAY CALLED.
WHICH WAS?

30:22.780 --> 30:23.986
UH, EMPIRE TAXI.

30:24.020 --> 30:25.942
(radio static and chatter)

30:25.990 --> 30:28.049
THIS IS JERRY.
WE GOT A SITUATION.

30:28.090 --> 30:30.558
THE GUY YOU PICKED UP
AT 39 MCKENNA AVENUE--

30:30.590 --> 30:32.285
WHERE DID YOU DROP HIM OFF?

30:33.860 --> 30:35.293
WHICH TERMINAL?

30:35.330 --> 30:38.299
OKAY. GREAT. THANK YOU.

30:38.330 --> 30:40.059

30:40.100 --> 30:42.295

30:42.340 --> 30:45.207
(sirens wailing)

30:45.240 --> 30:46.537
(click)

30:46.570 --> 30:48.174
DISPATCH, THIS IS 1514

30:48.210 --> 30:50.678
EN ROUTE TO THE FAST FERRY
TERMINAL ON A CODE ONE.

30:50.710 --> 30:52.302
CAN YOU GIVE ME

30:52.350 --> 30:53.749
(female dispatcher)
Copy, 1514.

30:53.780 --> 30:55.145

to Commissioners.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.085
THANK YOU.
(radio beeps)

30:58.120 --> 31:00.486
FERRY LEAVES EVERY HOUR.
LAST ONE LEI-T 20 MINUTES AGO.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.215
LET'S HOPE THEY MISSED IT.

31:02.260 --> 31:04.057
(sirens continue wailing)

31:04.090 --> 31:06.752
(Gail) WHAT THE HELL
HAS HAPPENED TO YOU?

31:06.790 --> 31:08.758
YOU USED TO BE
A GOOD DRIVER. TURN!

31:08.800 --> 31:10.552
(horn honking and passing)
I'M OUT OF PRACTICE.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.397
I HAVEN'T HAD A CAR
SINCE I CRASHED THE MG.

31:12.430 --> 31:14.591
(scoffs) THAT WAS
A TERRIBLE NIGHT.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.632
IT WASN'T TOTALLY
TERRIBLE.

31:17.670 --> 31:20.639
(ship horn blowing)

31:20.670 --> 31:22.570
(radio static)
This is Shaw. Three units
headed up to the ramp.

31:22.610 --> 31:24.168
We're gonna need support
on the ground

31:24.210 --> 31:26.269
in case they get behind us.
COPY.
WE'RE JUST PULLING UP.

31:26.310 --> 31:28.016

VICTIM IS A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

31:29.750 --> 31:33.242
Suspect is John Gray,

31:33.290 --> 31:34.552

31:34.590 --> 31:36.649
If you see them,
just hold them.

31:36.690 --> 31:38.351
Otherwise, I'll tell
the guys in Rochester

31:38.390 --> 31:39.789
to hold the ferry
when it docks.

31:39.830 --> 31:42.219
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
THANK YOU. EXCUSE ME.

31:42.260 --> 31:43.796
OLIVER.
YEAH?

31:43.830 --> 31:45.969
BLUE AND RED COAT.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.661
ALL RIGHT, FIRST PRIORITY
IS THE GIRL.

31:47.700 --> 31:50.134
YOU GET HER AWAY FROM HIM.
MAKE SURE THAT SHE IS SAFE.

31:50.170 --> 31:51.432
(lowered voice) GO!

31:55.710 --> 31:57.007
EXCUSE ME, MISS.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.177
CAN I HELP YOU?

31:58.210 --> 31:59.677
LOOK, I JUST NEED YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

31:59.710 --> 32:01.109
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
WRONG, ALL RIGHT?

32:01.150 --> 32:02.845
JUST LEAVE HER ALONE,
OKAY?
IT'S OKAY.

32:02.880 --> 32:05.417
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

32:05.450 --> 32:06.542
IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
DON'T TOUCH HER!

32:06.590 --> 32:07.989
HEY!
POLICE.
EVERYONE BACK INSIDE.

32:08.020 --> 32:11.558
GO AHEAD. SIR?
LET GO OF THE GIRL.

32:11.590 --> 32:14.150
SHOW ME YOUR HANDS.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.395
(whimpering)
IT'S OKAY.

32:16.430 --> 32:17.829
WE'RE FINE.

32:17.860 --> 32:19.396
WE'RE HAPPY.

32:19.430 --> 32:21.591
OKAY. JOHN,
THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.164
HEY, WE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

32:26.670 --> 32:28.308
COLLINS, STOP.

32:28.340 --> 32:29.978
JOHN.

32:31.510 --> 32:34.047
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS
SO NOBODY GETS HURT, OKAY?

32:34.080 --> 32:36.241
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
UNDERSTAND US.

32:38.620 --> 32:39.985
EDEN.

32:41.690 --> 32:44.158
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

32:44.190 --> 32:45.851
WE LOVE EACH OTHER, RIGHT?

32:45.890 --> 32:48.120
(sirens wailing)
Y-YEAH.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.651
(sirens approaching)

32:51.870 --> 32:53.269
WHAT--

32:53.300 --> 32:55.495
(inhales and exhales)

32:55.540 --> 32:56.859
(sirens continue wailing)

32:56.900 --> 32:58.458
WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?

32:58.510 --> 32:59.659
YOU'RE GONNA TURN AROUND

32:59.710 --> 33:00.961
AND PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK, JOHN.

33:01.010 --> 33:02.204
(sirens stop wailing)

33:02.240 --> 33:03.707
OKAY.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.045

33:13.250 --> 33:14.558
REPEAT,
SUSPECT IS IN THE WATER!

33:14.590 --> 33:15.909
WE NEED A MARINE UNIT
RIGHT AWAY!

33:15.960 --> 33:17.609
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SO--COLLINS!

33:26.730 --> 33:27.867
I FOUND HER.

33:27.900 --> 33:29.663
SHE WAS ABANDONED.
I LOOKED Al-TER HER.

33:29.700 --> 33:31.361
WE NEED EACH OTHER.
I HAVE TO SEE HER.

33:31.410 --> 33:32.968
YOU GOTTA LET ME SEE HER.
STOP.

33:33.010 --> 33:34.432
(grunts)
STOP TALKING.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.472
(radio chatter)

33:39.480 --> 33:40.504
I'VE BEEN RACKING MY BRAIN

33:40.550 --> 33:41.915
TRYING TO PUT IT
TOGETHER, ROOKIE.

33:41.950 --> 33:43.178
WHAT EXACTLY
WERE YOU THINKING?

33:43.220 --> 33:44.585
I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO GET AWAY.

33:44.620 --> 33:46.349
SO... YOU JUMPED 40 FEET
INTO A LAKE?

33:46.390 --> 33:48.119
I DOVE, TECHNICALLY,
BUT YEAH.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.685
YEAH? THAT'S A REAL
ROOKIE MOVE, COLLINS.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.086
(radio chatter)
SORRY, SIR.

33:53.130 --> 33:54.995
MY FAULT.

33:55.030 --> 33:57.794
I SHOULD HAVE FINISHED
GIVING YOU THAT TALK.

33:57.830 --> 34:04.338
***

34:04.370 --> 34:05.769
I FOLLOWED EVERY RULE
TO THE LETTER,

34:05.810 --> 34:08.438
AND IF YOU REINSTATE ME,
I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.471
(man) WHAT ABOUT
OFFICER SWAREK?

34:12.110 --> 34:14.044
I UNDERSTAND
HE'S BEEN CLEARED.

34:15.720 --> 34:18.041
YES, AI-TER ALSO BEING
SUSPENDED

34:18.090 --> 34:21.309
FOR CONDUCT UNBECOMING.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.727
YOU AND OFFICER SWAREK
JEOPARDIZED A MAJOR OPERATION

34:24.760 --> 34:26.489
BECAUSE OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

34:26.530 --> 34:28.623
PART OF THE MANDATE
OF YOUR SUSPENSION

34:28.660 --> 34:30.958
WAS THAT YOU WERE TO HAVE
NO CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.729
THAT'S RIGHT.

34:32.770 --> 34:34.135
AND?

34:34.170 --> 34:36.968
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
UNTIL TODAY.

34:37.000 --> 34:37.898
REALLY?

34:39.010 --> 34:41.877
I MEAN, THOSE WERE THE TERMS,
AND I FOLLOWED THEM.

34:41.910 --> 34:43.707
LOOK. I MADE A MISTAKE,

34:43.740 --> 34:45.276
AND IT ALMOST COST ME
EVERYTHING.

34:45.310 --> 34:47.198
I WASN'T ABOUT TO MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.609
THANK YOU, OFFICER.

34:52.650 --> 34:55.016
WE'LL NEED A MOMENT
TO DELIBERATE.

34:55.060 --> 34:56.812
THANK YOU.

34:59.530 --> 35:01.418
(sighs)

35:01.460 --> 35:03.052
OFFICER MCNALLY.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.727
YEA--I-I GUESS
I'M JUST CONFUSED

35:04.770 --> 35:06.692
ABOUT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

35:06.730 --> 35:09.062
I KNOW I MADE A MISTAKE,
BUT...

35:09.900 --> 35:12.403
WE FOUND A MISSING GIRL
TODAY.

35:12.440 --> 35:14.738
UM... I MEAN, SHE WAS GONE
A LONG TIME--

35:14.780 --> 35:17.578
A REALLY LONG TIME,
AND IT'S DAYS LIKE TODAY

35:17.610 --> 35:19.840
THAT...
JUST MAKE ME REALIZE

35:19.880 --> 35:22.371
HOW MUCH
MY JOB MEANS TO ME.

35:22.420 --> 35:25.844
MORE THAN I COULD TELL YOU
IN SOME LAME SPEECH

35:25.890 --> 35:28.484
THAT I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO WRITE FOR THREE MONTHS.

35:30.160 --> 35:34.597
TO GET TO DO THIS
IS AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE,

35:34.630 --> 35:37.895
AND I'M GOOD AT IT,
SO, PLEASE,

35:37.930 --> 35:40.296
PLEASE LET ME KEEP
DOING IT.

35:49.340 --> 35:52.047
(door closes)
(sighs)

35:52.080 --> 35:54.219
HENRY, IT MIGHT NOT BE HER.
SHE WON'T TELL US HER NAME.

35:54.250 --> 35:56.468
BUT IT'S THE GIRL
FROM THE--FROM THE VAN.

35:56.520 --> 35:57.646
YES.
YES.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.238
SO WE'RE GONNA
BRING YOU IN.

35:59.290 --> 36:01.417
BUT EVEN IF IT'S HER,
SHE MIGHT NOT REMEMBER YOU.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.859
I UNDERSTAND.

36:02.890 --> 36:04.926
OKAY, WE NEED HER
TO SAY WHO SHE IS.

36:04.960 --> 36:07.155
WE DON'T WANT
TO LEAD HER.
ALL RIGHT.

36:07.190 --> 36:09.420
HOLD ON.
AND IF IT'S NOT ALICE,

36:09.460 --> 36:11.564
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO LET ME KNOW.
I UNDERSTAND.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.261
(woman Speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

36:13.300 --> 36:14.437
(knock on door)

36:27.250 --> 36:29.172
HI.

36:39.790 --> 36:42.350
YOU MAY NOT REMEMBER ME,
BUT, UH...

36:46.800 --> 36:48.791

SWEETHEART.

37:03.850 --> 37:06.080

37:27.610 --> 37:31.569
I'M SO, SO SORRY
I LOST YOU.

37:33.610 --> 37:36.408

37:39.350 --> 37:42.649
(gasping)

37:45.860 --> 37:48.226
IT'S OKAY.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.864
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

37:53.300 --> 37:55.939
(woman) I'LL GET BACK TO YOU
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

37:55.970 --> 37:57.335

37:57.370 --> 37:59.008
(Chris) HEY, ANDY.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.667

I MEAN, YOU'RE JUST LEAVING?

38:29.770 --> 38:32.898
WHY? WHAT DO YOU WANT?

38:33.940 --> 38:35.908
MCNALLY, YOU LEI-T, OKAY?

38:35.940 --> 38:37.737
AI-TER EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENED BETWEEN US,

38:37.780 --> 38:39.907
YOU CUT IT OFF
BECAUSE SOME GUY

38:39.950 --> 38:41.679
WITH A WHITE SHIRT
TOLD YOU TO.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.210
OKAY. YOU BREAK
ALL THE RULES.

38:43.250 --> 38:45.343
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
BUT THAT'S NOT ME.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.187
I'M ONLY TWO YEARS
ON THIS JOB,

38:47.220 --> 38:48.619
A JOB I REALLY LOVE.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.651
YEAH. ALL YOU WANTED
WAS TO KEEP BEING A COP,

38:50.690 --> 38:52.783
AND ALL I WANTED WAS YOU.

A PRETTY GOOD FIRST DAY.

FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.

39:10.440 --> 39:11.577
OH, CHRIS.

39:11.610 --> 39:12.907
IT'S COOL.

I THINK THIS IS THE ONE.

39:25.430 --> 39:26.954

HEY, WAIT. CHRIS, I THINK
WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK.

39:32.130 --> 39:33.722

THAT'S 'CAUSE HE CAN'T
TALK BACK.

39:33.770 --> 39:35.237
(laughter continues)
(Oliver) OH!

39:35.270 --> 39:38.831
ALL RIGHT. DON'T THINK
I'M NOT FINDING YOU HILARIOUS.

39:38.870 --> 39:42.237
OH, MY GOD!
I ACTUALLY OUT-MEANED HER!

39:49.520 --> 39:51.886
THAT WAS INCREDIBLY STUPID,
WHAT YOU DID.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.410
YOU KNOW
WHAT THE WORST PART IS?

39:53.450 --> 39:55.213
IS THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY
GONNA KEEP YOU.

39:55.260 --> 39:56.852
I'M NOT GONNA GET RID

IT WAS BUSH LEAGUE.

39:59.660 --> 40:03.050
GAIL, I--
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
WE WERE ENGAGED.

40:03.100 --> 40:05.864
WE WEREN'T EXACTLY
ENGAGED.

40:05.900 --> 40:07.458
WE WERE ABOUT
TO GET MARRIED.
