01:41.768 --> 01:44.294
What are you guys
so happy about?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.235
You're starting Hell Week.

01:46.373 --> 01:47.704
I get the woolies just thinking

01:47.841 --> 01:49.639
of all the terrible things
they're gonna make you do.

01:49.776 --> 01:54.180
Al, we're joining the best frat
on campus, Phi Kappa Nu.

01:54.314 --> 01:56.112
Yeah, it's got
the-the highest grade standing.

01:56.249 --> 01:57.774
It's got the best athletes.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.351
It's got
the best fraternity house.

01:59.486 --> 02:00.886
You don't just goof around.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.648
Like, all afternoon,
we've been out collecting toys

02:02.789 --> 02:03.847
for underprivileged children.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.982
Ah, fraternities.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.151
I wish I was...
ten years younger.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.661
Yeah.

02:14.201 --> 02:17.000
Hey.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.077
Let me tell you something,
my little gladiola.

02:25.212 --> 02:27.647
Don't you brood,
'cause once I touch your car,

02:27.781 --> 02:32.651
I'm gonna get it in
as good of shape as... you are.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.345
- RALPH: Fonz! -POTSIE: Hey,
Fonzie, how you doing?

02:34.488 --> 02:35.682
Hey, look who's over there.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.519
- If it ain't Potsie
and Ralph and Richie. -Yeah.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.717
See, there's my friends.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.828
Listen, you remember Boom Boom?

02:41.962 --> 02:45.193
Yeah, she was, uh,
last month's, uh, centerfold

02:45.332 --> 02:48.063
<i>'m All About Roller Derby.</i>

02:48.201 --> 02:49.294
Oh, yeah.

02:49.436 --> 02:50.870
I saw her on television.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.495
These are my buddies.
They're college men.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.972
Very intellectual
fraternity boys...

02:55.108 --> 02:57.771
dressed like... bowling pins.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.405
Well, Fonz...

03:00.547 --> 03:03.380
Fonz, we got to wear the
beanies, because it's Hell Week.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.814
Oh, right. See that?

03:04.951 --> 03:06.578
The whole week,
they're gonna eat goldfish,

03:06.720 --> 03:09.519
get paddled upside one down
their body, down the other.

03:09.656 --> 03:11.920
- Yeah. -Eating goldfish.
Fun stuff, Fonz.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.186
Yeah, but once
we get through Hell Week,

03:14.327 --> 03:16.455
then we're fraternity brothers
for life.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.223
- Brothers! -Brothers!
- FONZIE: Right, right.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.197
Well, I got no time
for college frolicking.

03:20.333 --> 03:24.031
You know, see, her '51 MG
got vandalized on the street,

03:24.171 --> 03:25.195
stripped to the bone.

03:25.338 --> 03:26.567
OTHERS:
Aw!

03:26.707 --> 03:28.140
Soto speak. Yeah.

03:29.509 --> 03:30.442
Do me a favor, okay?

03:30.577 --> 03:31.669
Here's a dime.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.973
Go right over there--
that a girl--

03:34.114 --> 03:35.980
and call Happy Harry's Garage.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.550
You got that? Right?

03:37.684 --> 03:39.015
Ask him for a carburetor.

03:39.152 --> 03:41.143
Here you go.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.116
I'm gonna get her a new chassis.

03:45.258 --> 03:46.954
Not that she needs one.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.333
There's the president of PKN.
More fun, guys.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.663
Got any good pledges this year?

03:56.803 --> 03:59.363
Uh, well, there's Myers.
He's not bad. Johnson.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.136
Cunningham I like.

04:02.275 --> 04:04.540
I'm not so sure about Malph
and Weber, though, uh...

04:04.678 --> 04:05.736
Malph and Weber, huh?

04:05.879 --> 04:08.075
Hey, and the pledge master,
Terrible Tom.

04:08.215 --> 04:10.046
He's all right.
Come on, let's go.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.412
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, fellas.

04:11.551 --> 04:12.780
- Hi.
- All right, hi.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.114
We got to get back
to the frat house,

04:14.254 --> 04:15.380
set things up
for the dance tonight.

04:15.522 --> 04:16.853
- RALPH: Yes, sir.
- RICHIE: All right.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.185
Where are the other pledges?

04:18.325 --> 04:19.622
Uh, they're not here yet, Brad.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.523
Let me have some fun
with the ones we got, huh?

04:21.661 --> 04:23.288
You know, sort of
whip 'em into shape.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.829
They're all yours.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.592
-(throat clearing)
- All right, now, pledges,

04:26.733 --> 04:30.101
all I want you to do is deliver
these party invitations

04:30.237 --> 04:31.704
to the Iota girls.

04:31.838 --> 04:34.205
RALPH & POTSIE:
Yes, sir, sir!

04:34.341 --> 04:36.138
- RICHIE: Uh...
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.540
Those are airmail.

04:38.678 --> 04:40.408
Man your planes, pledges!

04:40.547 --> 04:42.037
(making nasal, buzzing sounds)

04:42.182 --> 04:43.741
Malph, there's an Iota at 6:00.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.943
-(making nasal buzzing sounds)
- Weber, hit the air.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.179
Cunningham, you're sputtering.

04:48.321 --> 04:49.653
Refuel!

04:49.790 --> 04:51.018
Oh!

04:51.158 --> 04:52.523
(nasal humming)

04:52.659 --> 04:54.320
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

04:54.461 --> 04:55.553
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Zih.

04:55.695 --> 04:57.527
- Yeah, ziz, ziz, zih, right.
-(board slapping)

04:57.664 --> 04:59.155
Cunningham,
let me ask you a question.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.325
Is this the way that college
is preparing you for life?

05:02.469 --> 05:03.629
(board slapping)

05:03.770 --> 05:05.397
Oh, Fonz, I realize
this looks a little silly.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.029
-(nasal buzzing continues)
- Yeah. -Oh.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.641
- It may be silly...
-(board slapping)

05:08.775 --> 05:10.607
...but-but we got to prove that
we're worthy of being PKNs.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.303
That's the whole point
of all this stuff.

05:12.445 --> 05:13.936
And, yeah,
it is very important to us.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.104
Yeah, I'll tell you something.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.739
I didn't realize
how important it was.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.351
Go back to being a bumblebee.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.975
(board slapping)

05:20.120 --> 05:22.247
-(nasal buzzing continues)
- I'm a plane.

05:22.389 --> 05:23.856
No, you're not.
I know planes.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.754
I've got a Min-engine model
over here.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.360
(Fonzie laughs)

05:27.494 --> 05:30.190
(buzzing continues)

05:30.330 --> 05:32.424
BRAD:
That's enough.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.329
- Okay, all right. -We got
to get 'em back to the house.

05:34.467 --> 05:35.696
We'll take care
of the other pledges later.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.098
- Let's go, pledges.
- Yes, sir.

05:37.237 --> 05:39.706
Ah... let's go as ducks.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.364
More fun, right?

05:41.508 --> 05:42.998
Get quacking, pledgers.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.736
(Richie, Potsie and Ralph
making quacking sounds)

05:44.878 --> 05:47.006
First one back gets a bowl
of bird seed.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.273
Wow, a prize!

05:48.415 --> 05:50.212
(quacking resumes)

05:50.350 --> 05:51.476

06:04.197 --> 06:05.756
Hi, Dad.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.300
Hi, Richard.

06:08.435 --> 06:10.062
Richard?!

06:10.203 --> 06:14.163
Hey, the molasses
and feather bit, huh?

06:14.307 --> 06:15.673
-(chuckles)
- You started Hell Week.

06:15.809 --> 06:16.935
Terrific.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.510
Dad, I just...
I wish you could've seen it.

06:18.645 --> 06:19.737
- I mean, it was fantastic.
- Yeah?

06:19.879 --> 06:21.507
- First, they paddled us.
Oh, it's... -Uh-huh.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.912
- Then they hit us in the face
with raw eggs. -Uh-huh.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.679
They made us roll peanuts
around the floor with our noses.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.287
It was... (laughs)

06:28.421 --> 06:29.616
It was just great.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.622
Yeah, yeah, I know.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.157
I loved it, too.

06:33.293 --> 06:35.159
-(Richie laughs)
- Ah, good old PKN.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.127
Those were the days.
Congratulations again, Richard.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.993
Thank you, Dad.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.964
- What memories.
- Yeah.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.968
I better take this, uh,
sack of feathers on upstairs.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.503
Sack of feathers?

06:45.639 --> 06:46.799
Oh, yeah, yeah.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.567
They-they let me
keep the leftovers.

06:48.708 --> 06:52.440
See, there was this one
very short pledge, you know.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.810
Boy, college is helping him
already.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.178
(chuckles)

06:59.419 --> 07:01.410
Oh, hi.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.787
Hi, sweetheart.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.084
Hi, dear.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.455
Oh, uh, Howard, dear,
would you give Chachi a quarter?

07:07.594 --> 07:09.426
- He was such a help.
- Hmm.

07:09.562 --> 07:11.292
Wait. What is this?
I carry groceries in

07:11.431 --> 07:13.627
all the time,
and I don't get paid for it.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.634
Well, Chachi didn't get
a new dress on Saturday.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.261
Thanks, Mrs. C,
but I'll settle for the quarter.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.737
Yeah, well, Chachi, now, look,

07:20.874 --> 07:23.104
I'm going to have
to give it to you later.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.109
I got nothing smaller
than a dollar bill.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.304
Well, I can make change.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.646
Want to try double or nothing?

07:31.785 --> 07:35.346
Just give me the change, huh?

07:35.488 --> 07:38.822
Hey, Mom, do you know where
my other good white shirt is?

07:38.958 --> 07:40.449
Oh, Richard, what on...

07:40.593 --> 07:43.085
Oh, Richard, Richard,
you're just tracking feathers

07:43.229 --> 07:44.822
all over my clean house.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.126
Come on, I'll vacuum you.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.794
My wonderful son here
just happened

07:51.938 --> 07:54.134
to join the best fraternity
on campus.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.742
(laughs)
Which one?

07:55.875 --> 07:57.241
Kappa Kappa Cluck?

07:57.377 --> 07:59.345
(Joanie laughs)

07:59.479 --> 08:01.573
Oh, Joanie, that's not nice.

08:01.715 --> 08:02.739
Oh.

08:02.882 --> 08:04.248
Can you lay an egg?

08:05.652 --> 08:07.848
If I do, will you sit on it?

08:07.987 --> 08:11.583
(laughter)

08:13.360 --> 08:15.487
Joanie, why don't you and Chachi
put the groceries away, huh?

08:15.628 --> 08:17.255
- Oh.
- Oh, okay, Dad.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.263
Hey, blue eyes,

08:19.399 --> 08:21.458
how'd you like
to get initiated into my club?

08:21.601 --> 08:24.867
I'd rather get tarred
and feathered.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.872
You know, Marion,
he didn't just join a frat.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.909
He joined PKN,
just like his old dad.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.203
Don't remind me.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.405
All that silly
fraternity nonsense.

08:35.548 --> 08:37.676
When they poured whitewash
over your head,

08:37.817 --> 08:39.842
and all the girls teased me.

08:39.986 --> 08:44.014
"Oh, Marion, who's the chubby
little snowman?"

08:46.059 --> 08:48.187
I was not chubby then.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.990
Besides, fraternities
are not silly.

08:51.131 --> 08:54.589
Fraternity ties can be
very important in later years.

08:54.734 --> 08:57.636
They made him sew "Chubby"
on his fraternity sweater.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.604
Kept his hand over it all the
time, but I knew it was there.

09:00.740 --> 09:03.004
(laughs) Must have looked like
he was pledging allegiance.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.804
Oh, Richie, that's a good one.

09:04.944 --> 09:07.777
Do you mind? Can we drop
this "Chubby" business?

09:07.914 --> 09:10.906
Oh, this has been
such a fun day.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.746
Dad, you must have looked
pretty cute

09:12.886 --> 09:14.012
with the "Chubby"
and the snow...

09:14.154 --> 09:15.314
Yeah.

09:15.455 --> 09:16.923
Well, I think I'll...
I'll get cleaned up now.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.149
(Richie clears throat)

09:18.291 --> 09:19.520
We're having a dance
for our sister sorority.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.024
You know, the-the Iota girls.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.958
Oh, yeah, but wait, Richard,
before you go.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.861
Uh, the old PKN chant, huh?
Come on, let's do it.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.091
Oh, I-l don't know, Dad.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.530
I'm not sure
that I really know it yet.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.500
- I just started learning it.
- Well, all right, come on!

09:30.637 --> 09:31.934
We'll give it the college try,
all right?

09:32.071 --> 09:33.232
- Okay.
- You ready?

09:33.373 --> 09:34.431
Yeah.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.838
BOTH:
Come on, brother, don't be blue.

09:36.976 --> 09:39.411
We're the tops, Phi Kappa Nu.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.946
PKN, PKN.

09:42.081 --> 09:45.381
We did it before,
and we can do it again! Hey!

09:51.391 --> 09:53.757
Oh. Fonzie,
Dad and I were just...

09:53.893 --> 09:55.486
No, no, uh, uh, uh,
ho, ho, ho.

09:55.628 --> 09:56.652
It's all right, Richie.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.958
I'll make up my own story. Whoa!

10:05.572 --> 10:07.563
(upbeat 1950s
instrumental music plays)

10:17.584 --> 10:20.280
-(Brad clears throat)
-(indistinct chatter)

10:21.588 --> 10:23.749
Huh? Huh?

10:23.890 --> 10:26.222
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.987
Imagine us
at a fraternity dance.

10:29.128 --> 10:32.064
Yeah, and they didn't stamp
our hand or nothing.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.290
- Yeah.
- Nothing.

10:33.433 --> 10:34.832
Ooh, I love it.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.027
-(sniffs) Smells just like
my soap. -(Potsie laughs)

10:37.170 --> 10:38.831
Did I lie, girls?

10:38.972 --> 10:41.099
Isn't this everything
I said it would be?

10:41.241 --> 10:42.401
Better.

10:42.542 --> 10:43.941
- Oh, look, a piano.
- Oh.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.601
Yeah, yeah, I play.

10:45.745 --> 10:48.214
Oh, so do we,
but not on the first date.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.841
-(laughter)
- That sounds great.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.511
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

10:54.654 --> 10:55.712
- Hey.
-(indistinct chatter)

10:55.855 --> 10:57.550
- Hi, guys. -Hey.
- Hey, Rich.

10:57.690 --> 10:59.317
- Buddy boy, how you doing?
- I'm fine.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.518
Look, uh, we-we got to talk,
maybe over at the punch bowl...

11:01.661 --> 11:03.493
Wait a minute, Rich. I want you
to meet Claudia and Darlene.

11:03.630 --> 11:04.494
Hi.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.689
- Hello.
- Hi.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.061
Yeah, they work
at the Blue Bird Diner.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.395
Some dishes, huh?

11:08.535 --> 11:09.934
Dishes, diner. Get it?

11:10.069 --> 11:12.061
- Yeah.
- I still got it.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.674
We work the steam table.

11:14.807 --> 11:17.208
Yeah, that's how come
we got frizzy hair. See?

11:17.343 --> 11:18.606
Oh, yeah, frizzy.

11:18.745 --> 11:19.974
I see. It's-it's nice.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.046
Oh, thanks.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.409
Uh, look, would you mind

11:22.549 --> 11:24.676
if we left you girls alone
for just a minute?

11:24.817 --> 11:28.185
Oh, sure.
We'll, uh... hold the order?

11:28.321 --> 11:29.914
Hold the order.
That's great.

11:30.056 --> 11:32.525
- Come on, guys.
- Be back in a minute.

11:32.659 --> 11:33.785
Over at the punch table here.

11:33.927 --> 11:34.951
- See you later, yeah.
- See you later, right.

11:35.094 --> 11:36.153
Aren't they great?

11:36.296 --> 11:37.786
- Aren't they terrific?
- Don't worry.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.527
Uh, guys,

11:40.667 --> 11:42.533
-why in the world did you
bring dates? -Thanks, Ralph.

11:42.669 --> 11:45.001
Well, we owe 'em, Rich.
They gave us extra flapjacks.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.766
Yes, so we told 'em we'd bring
them to our first frat dance.

11:47.907 --> 11:49.705
Right, what's two girls
more or less?

11:49.842 --> 11:52.038
It's got the fraternity guys
very upset.

11:52.178 --> 11:54.238
They think it's an insult
to the Iota girls.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.110
It's supposed
to be a closed party.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.546
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

11:57.684 --> 11:59.083
Well, what are we gonna do?

11:59.218 --> 12:00.550
We can't toss the girls out.

12:00.687 --> 12:03.383
POTSIE: No kidding. Darlene's
the bouncer at the diner.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.082
Hello, pledges.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.853
POTSIE, RALPH & RICHIE:
Hello, brother Donnelly, sir.

12:07.994 --> 12:11.623
I notice you don't have
your pledge books with you.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.563
Oh, Tom, no pledge books here.

12:14.701 --> 12:16.259
No books?

12:16.402 --> 12:18.837
Oh, you guys must think
you know everything, huh?

12:18.972 --> 12:20.098
Most of it, sir.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.606
The Greek alphabet, Cunningham.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.642
Oh. Alpha, beta, gamma, delta...

12:24.777 --> 12:26.006
All right, all right,
Cunningham.

12:26.145 --> 12:27.477
You, Malph.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.639
- Alpha, beta, gamma...
- TOM: Uh...

12:29.782 --> 12:31.512
- Backwards.
- RALPH: Backwards?

12:31.651 --> 12:33.141
Backwards, Malph.

12:35.021 --> 12:38.218
Alpha, beta, gamma, delta...

12:39.659 --> 12:41.855
Enough, Malph, enough.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.395
Get it? Get it? Backwards.
I thought that was pretty good.

12:44.530 --> 12:47.125
You're gonna have
a funny guy here.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.666
You guys must
really like parties.

12:48.801 --> 12:49.996
- ALL: Oh, yeah.
- Oh, have I got

12:50.136 --> 12:52.195
-a party for you.
- Great, great! -Oh, great!

12:52.338 --> 12:53.931
A work party.

12:54.073 --> 12:56.269
- More fun!
- You'll see.

12:56.409 --> 12:57.934
- And now you, Weber.
- Y-Yes, sir.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.670
Have you learned
the fraternity song?

12:59.812 --> 13:00.677
Oh, yes, sir.

13:00.813 --> 13:03.009
Everyone, gather round!

13:03.149 --> 13:05.208
Pledge Weber
is going to entertain us

13:05.351 --> 13:07.945
with his rendition
of our fraternity song.

13:08.087 --> 13:11.353
And, uh, Weber,
it better be perfect.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.960
Uh, yes, sir. Come on, Malph.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.619
Hey, guys, look, sideways.

13:16.763 --> 13:19.630
Alpha, beta, gamma...

13:19.766 --> 13:22.599
What a prize you guys
are getting, fun and music.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.169
Come on, girls.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.205
- Somebody get the lights.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.145
Boy, what laughs
we're having, huh?

14:41.280 --> 14:44.478
- Yeah, scrubbing floors
with a toothbrush. -(chuckling)

14:44.617 --> 14:47.211
- And I thought I'd miss
high school. -Yeah.

14:47.353 --> 14:49.686
I'm just glad we don't have
to brush after each meal.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.291
(chuckles)
Ah, it's worth it, Rich.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.450
I wonder how long
we get to do this.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.619
Oh, probably till they're done
with their meeting.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.128
I wonder
what they're meeting about.

14:58.264 --> 14:59.925
No doubt deciding
what to give me

15:00.066 --> 15:02.228
-for being the funniest pledge.
- Yeah, right?

15:06.272 --> 15:07.637
Good work, pledges.

15:07.774 --> 15:10.174
- You can stop scrubbing now.
- Oh, good.

15:10.309 --> 15:13.279
- I was wrecking
my new toothbrush. -Yeah.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.278
- Uh, Cunningham.
- Yes, sir.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.905
We ran out of stamps.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.415
Would you deliver this letter
for us, please?

15:18.551 --> 15:20.076
Oh, yes, sir.

15:20.219 --> 15:22.779
Oh, this goes to Oshkosh.
That's 40 miles away.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.323
I know. So you'd better
take it airmail.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.324
Uh... (mumbles)

15:27.460 --> 15:29.451
(mimics buzzing airplane engine)

15:32.098 --> 15:33.759
You got one for me?
I fly in fog.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.891
-(chuckles)
- No letter, Malph.

15:36.035 --> 15:37.628
Oh, you want to break eggs
on our heads again.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.965
That was great.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.436
That's not it.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.269
We've decided to let you join
another fraternity.

15:43.409 --> 15:46.572
(laughs)
Thanks, but this one's fine.

15:46.712 --> 15:49.910
You fraternity guys crack me up.
You're just like me.

15:50.049 --> 15:52.484
- They're such kidders, Pots.
- I know. -No kidding, Malph.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.985
You and Weber
are not PKN material.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.611
You've been blackballed.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.837
<i>RALPH:
Don't worry, Boom Boom.</i>

16:15.975 --> 16:17.841
<i>Fonzie will be out
of his office in a minute.</i>

16:17.977 --> 16:19.843
Uh... hi, guys.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.845
- RALPH a POTSIE: Hey, Rich.
- Hi.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.780
So, uh, what's new?

16:24.917 --> 16:26.783
Uh, no, uh...
(clears throat)

16:26.919 --> 16:29.388
Hey, guys, uh,
want to go out and, uh,

16:29.522 --> 16:32.389
play a little blackball?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.391
Uh, basketball.
You know, I meant

16:34.527 --> 16:36.051
maybe we could shoot
a few baskets. We could...

16:36.195 --> 16:39.062
- I'm not in the mood.
- Uh, no basketball, Rich.

16:39.198 --> 16:43.158
Okay, could you, uh... could you
excuse us for just a minute?

16:46.472 --> 16:47.803
(sighs heavily)

16:49.408 --> 16:51.536
Hey, Rich, ask her again.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.202
Just for a minute.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.337
Thanks.

16:57.383 --> 17:00.011
Okay, I heard
about what happened.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.986
They dumped us, Rich.
Can you beat that?

17:03.122 --> 17:05.989
And we really worked hard.
It's just not fair.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.593
I think it's terrible.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.387
And that's why, uh...

17:09.528 --> 17:12.589
I'm-I'm thinking about quitting.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.256
- Quitting?
- Yeah.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.596
W-Wait a minute, Rich,
no, why should you quit?

17:16.736 --> 17:18.396
We broke the rules, not you.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.936
Yeah, PKN is good for you.

17:20.071 --> 17:22.165
Look, we'll find
another fraternity.

17:23.675 --> 17:27.203
Oh, man, that's-that's
really nice of you guys.

17:27.346 --> 17:30.680
Besides, Fonzie thinks
all PKNs are nerds.

17:30.816 --> 17:33.012
Yeah...

17:33.152 --> 17:34.677
Fonzie said what?

17:34.820 --> 17:36.220
You know, nerds.

17:36.355 --> 17:38.221
He called the PKNs nerds?

17:38.357 --> 17:40.053
I'm a PKN.

17:40.192 --> 17:42.218
That's frat biz.

17:42.361 --> 17:45.524
If he's calling PKNs nerds,
then he's calling me a nerd.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.394
You might say that.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.729
Well, he can't go around
calling PKNs nerds!

17:49.869 --> 17:51.666
Well, don't yell at us.
Yell at him.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.068
Well, he's just lucky
that he's not here.

17:54.206 --> 17:55.504
He's in his office.

17:56.609 --> 17:57.701
Oh, you probably think
I'm afraid.

17:57.843 --> 17:59.675
You think I'm scared
to go in there, huh?

18:00.713 --> 18:02.909
Ha!

18:03.049 --> 18:05.574
The PKNs are not nerds!

18:05.718 --> 18:07.709
Why, you've read the bylaws.
It says you must defend

18:07.853 --> 18:09.879
your fraternity brothers
against all interlopers!

18:10.022 --> 18:11.490
Well, I'll tell you
something, buckos,

18:11.624 --> 18:13.490
I'm defending
my fraternity brothers!

18:13.626 --> 18:15.890
...except this time,
will you send me a clean one?

18:16.028 --> 18:18.088
You know what happened the last
time I tried to put it in?

18:18.230 --> 18:19.755
All right, Fonzarelli,
will you get off the phone?

18:19.899 --> 18:21.423
You and I have something
to talk about!

18:21.567 --> 18:23.558
Look, all right, I'm gonna send
somebody over there.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.103
I know it's on Main and Elm.
Thank you very much.

18:26.238 --> 18:28.935
I'm off the phone. You see that?
I'm off the phone!

18:29.075 --> 18:30.668
All right, now,
what are you yelling at?

18:30.810 --> 18:33.074
I'm yelling because...
What are you doing on skates?

18:33.212 --> 18:35.408
I don't know!
I get nutso sometimes.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.574
I mean, Boom Boom's on skates.
I'm trying to keep up with her.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.187
Now, what are you yelling about?
What is all this?

18:41.320 --> 18:42.720
I'm yelling
because you called me a nerd.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.255
I have known you
all these years, Fonz.

18:44.390 --> 18:45.789
You have never, ever
called me that.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.051
Well, I'm not calling you
a nerd now.

18:47.193 --> 18:48.456
I called PKNs nerds.

18:48.594 --> 18:50.085
If the shoe fits.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.357
- Heyyy.
- What? If the shoe fits?

18:52.498 --> 18:54.364
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- Oh!

18:54.500 --> 18:56.025
I'm telling you something,
Fonzie.

18:56.168 --> 18:58.364
- You don't know anything
about fraternities. -Oh, yeah?

18:58.504 --> 19:00.370
- I know something...
Where are you now? -I'm in here.

19:00.506 --> 19:02.975
Well, then get out here!
I can't skate in there.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.578
- I'm out! I'm out.
- All right.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.975
Now, look, what is your problem?

19:08.114 --> 19:09.479
Who are you yelling at?

19:09.615 --> 19:11.481
I am not yelling!

19:11.617 --> 19:13.381
It's an echo.

19:15.621 --> 19:17.612
Whoa.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.825
There's no echo in here.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.326
Now, what's your problem?

19:23.462 --> 19:26.523
Fonzie, you do not understand
the way a fraternity works.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.190
I might not understand
fraternities,

19:28.334 --> 19:30.700
but I understand
dumping friends.

19:30.836 --> 19:31.860
I didn't dump anybody.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.335
Ralph and Potsie
are still my friends.

19:33.472 --> 19:34.735
Th-They're behind me.

19:34.874 --> 19:38.207
Oh, sure, as long as they don't
get in your frat way.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.640
Whoa.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.074
Fonzie, I don't have
to spend every minute with them.

19:45.217 --> 19:46.913
We are not joined at the hips.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.577
All I wanted to find out, Red,

19:48.721 --> 19:51.053
was whether you were dumping
Ralph and Potsie.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.248
That is all.

19:52.391 --> 19:54.223
That's all?

19:54.360 --> 19:55.623
That's it.

19:55.761 --> 19:57.957
Oh, well,
then I-I'm sorry I yelled. I...

19:58.097 --> 19:59.622
It's all right.

19:59.765 --> 20:02.029
I guess I'm kind of upset
about this, too.

20:02.168 --> 20:04.295
Ralph and Potsie and...

20:04.437 --> 20:06.837
PKN's nerds...

20:06.972 --> 20:11.034
Fonzie, see, I-l really
don't want to quit PKNs.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.509
Why? 'Cause PKN are...
they're cool?

20:13.646 --> 20:15.910
- Yeah, PKN is cool.
- Let me tell you something, Red.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.573
Organizations aren't cool.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.844
People are cool.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.446
Well... right,
I-l realize that, Fonz.

20:24.590 --> 20:26.456
But th-this could be
so good for me.

20:26.592 --> 20:27.992
I don't understand
what you're talking about there,

20:28.127 --> 20:30.255
but you got to do
what you got to do, so go do it.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.488
- Uh...
- Do me a favor, all right?

20:31.630 --> 20:32.598
- Yeah, sure.
- Now, look,

20:32.732 --> 20:34.666
tell Boom Boom to go down
to Main and Elm

20:34.800 --> 20:38.361
to Greasy Glen's Garage
and pick me up a carburetor.

20:38.504 --> 20:39.972
- Greasy Glen's. I got it.
- Yeah.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.698
And I'll just tell her.
You know, I won't yell.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.035
I'm not yelling anymore.

20:43.175 --> 20:44.700
- PKNs don't yell, Fonz.
- Whoa!

20:44.844 --> 20:46.835
All right.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.038
Kids.
(chuckles)

20:53.052 --> 20:55.043
Whoa!

20:55.187 --> 20:56.587
What?

20:56.722 --> 21:00.249
<i>"Nfimero, por favor"?</i>

21:00.392 --> 21:04.454
I must have hit it too hard.
I got long distance.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.463
- Okay...
- Cunningham.

21:06.599 --> 21:10.001
Uh, you all set to decorate for
the initiation party tonight?

21:10.136 --> 21:13.663
Oh, yes, sir. I've, uh,
got the crepe paper in my car.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.332
I'll see you guys later,
all right?

21:16.475 --> 21:18.000
- Richie.
- Huh?

21:18.144 --> 21:20.009
We have a problem here.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.671
Oh, is there something wrong?

21:22.815 --> 21:25.250
- Tell him, Tom.
- It's...

21:25.384 --> 21:27.409
it's those guys, Cunningham.
We blackballed 'em.

21:27.553 --> 21:28.952
And-and here you are
sitting with them.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.954
It doesn't look good for us
if you're hanging around

21:31.090 --> 21:32.614
with pledges we dumped.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.859
Well, th-they're
my friends, though.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.519
Oh, Rich,
we're your friends now.

21:37.663 --> 21:40.189
Maybe it's time you outgrew
your high school buddies.

21:40.332 --> 21:42.358
<i>Outgrew'?</i>

21:42.501 --> 21:44.470
Oh, look, uh...

21:44.603 --> 21:47.869
Tom, Brad, I-l really want
to be in PKN,

21:48.007 --> 21:50.806
but I want to be able
to keep my old friends.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.934
It shouldn't have
to totally dominate my life.

21:53.078 --> 21:54.603
Other fraternities
don't do that.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.238
Rich, that's exactly why we're
number one and they're not.

21:57.383 --> 21:59.078
Rich, you're still
a freshman, immature.

21:59.218 --> 22:00.845
You're like a piece of clay,

22:00.986 --> 22:04.923
but we'll mold and shape you
into a real PKN.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.130
Come on, Cunningham.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.670
Hold it just a minute!

22:23.475 --> 22:25.341
Telling me
who I can have for friends?

22:25.477 --> 22:27.343
Th-That's supposed
to be shaping me?

22:27.479 --> 22:29.471
- Rich... -Next thing you're
gonna do, you're gonna tell me

22:29.615 --> 22:31.140
I can't talk
to my friend Fonzie here?

22:31.283 --> 22:32.808
Or my sister Joanie

22:32.952 --> 22:34.977
-because she's not an Iota?
- Cunningham...

22:35.120 --> 22:36.782
Maybe I don't want
to be number one.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.217
Maybe not at those prices.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.723
Cunningham, do you know
what you're doing?

22:40.860 --> 22:42.259
Yes, sir.

22:42.394 --> 22:44.920
I'm dumping you, sir.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.532
Phi Kappa Nu. People-shaping.

22:48.667 --> 22:52.035
The whole duck-quacking,
feathered peanut-pushing thing.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.367
I am Richie Cunningham,

22:54.506 --> 22:56.975
and these are my friends.

23:03.482 --> 23:06.349
So you can just put that
in your Phi Kappa and...

23:56.235 --> 23:58.636
Oh, yeah, sure.

23:58.771 --> 24:03.936
Dad, you know that I-l am sorry
about not getting in the PKNs.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.272
Well, I think you made
the right choice, Richard.

24:06.412 --> 24:09.973
From what you told me, the old
PKN is not what it used to be.

24:10.115 --> 24:13.415
No. I-l hope I can get
into another fraternity, though.

24:13.552 --> 24:15.418
It doesn't really matter,
you know.

24:15.554 --> 24:18.148
I didn't become a PKN
till I was a junior.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.623
It's really up to you.
But just...

24:20.759 --> 24:24.161
don't join a fraternity to
become part of the crowd, huh?

24:24.296 --> 24:26.162
Yeah. Thanks, Dad.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.164

the pigskin. -Right.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.825

24:29.969 --> 24:32.199

Well, let's get down there.

quacking)

24:40.279 --> 24:42.475
Oh, Dad,

24:42.614 --> 24:44.742
I-I'm not trying
to be part of the crowd.

24:44.883 --> 24:47.148
