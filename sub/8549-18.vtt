13:39.987 --> 13:42.122
I CAN'T HOLD ON

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:07.414 --> 14:09.116
TIGHTROPE WALKING.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.684
DO YOU KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT?

14:11.751 --> 14:13.486
NO.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.841
AAH! AAH!

14:34.908 --> 14:36.576

TALKING ABOUT?

15:23.991 --> 15:26.293
PROBABLY THE BOOZE
IN MY COAT.

IS STEVE OKAY?

15:33.967 --> 15:35.935
YEAH. RACHEL'S
TAKING HIM HOME.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.438
SEE, OFFICER?
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.307
WE WERE JUST
HAVING A LITTLE FUN.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.875
FUN? STEVE COULD
HAVE BEEN KILLED.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.645
BUT HE WASN'T.
SO CHILL OUT, OKAY?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.982
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.850
YOU THINK IT'S COOL
COMING TO A PARTY

15:50.917 --> 15:52.385
WITH A MINIBAR
IN YOUR COAT?

15:52.452 --> 15:54.654
YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY
TO SPIKE SOMEBODY'S PUNCH

15:54.721 --> 15:56.689
AND WATCH THEM
ACT LIKE A FOOL?

15:56.756 --> 15:58.458
WELL, IT'S NOT COOL.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.527
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
IT'S DANGEROUS.

16:02.229 --> 16:05.132
IT'S ALSO
AGAINST THE LAW.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.000
WHERE WE GOING,
WILLIE?

16:08.535 --> 16:09.569
JAIL, I GUESS.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.139
JUVENILE HALL UNTIL YOUR PARENTS
PICK YOU UP.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.606
WE GET
A PHONE CALL?

16:13.673 --> 16:16.209
ONE CALL.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.411
CAN IT BE A 976 NUMBER?

16:30.923 --> 16:32.225
IT'S CONFIRMED--

16:32.292 --> 16:35.695
SIX DAYS AND FIVE NIGHTS
AT LAKE GENEVA.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.198
CARL WILL BE HAPPY.

16:38.265 --> 16:41.368
I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL HIM
THE GOOD NEWS.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.538
HI, SWEETIE.
HI, MA.

16:45.605 --> 16:46.806
HI, HONEY.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.041
OH, CARL,

16:48.108 --> 16:50.110
WE'VE DECIDED WHERE
TO GO ON OUR VACATION.

16:52.212 --> 16:55.082
OH, YOU HAVE, HAVE YOU?

16:58.118 --> 17:02.089
I COME HOME FROM A HARD DAY
OF FIGHTING CRIME,

17:02.155 --> 17:04.391
AND DO I HEAR,
"HI, CARL.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.526
COULD I GET YOU
SOME TRAIL MIX?"

17:06.593 --> 17:09.929
NO, I DO NOT.

17:09.996 --> 17:14.201
WELL, I GUESS MY VOTE DOESN'T
COUNT AROUND HERE,

17:14.267 --> 17:16.369
BUT MAY I
REMIND YOU TWO

17:16.436 --> 17:20.740
THAT I BRING HOME
DARN CLOSE TO 50%

17:20.807 --> 17:22.275
OF THIS FAMILY'S
BACON?

17:22.342 --> 17:24.677
AND YOU EAT
DARN CLOSE TO 90%.

17:27.947 --> 17:31.151
WELL, THANK YOU FOR THOSE KIND
WORDS, MOTHER.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.653
BUT I'M MERELY
TRYING TO POINT OUT

17:33.720 --> 17:37.657
THAT WHENEVER VACATION TIME
ROLLS AROUND...

17:39.926 --> 17:41.828
MY DESIRES,

17:41.894 --> 17:43.863
MY WISHES,

17:43.930 --> 17:46.666
ARE NEVER
EVEN CONSIDERED.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.000
CARL--
AND WHY?

17:48.067 --> 17:51.171
BECAUSE I DON'T MATTER,
DO I, HARRIETTE?

17:51.238 --> 17:55.142
I DON'T MATTER.
ONCE, JUST ONCE,

17:55.208 --> 17:57.244
CAN WE GO WHERE
I'D LIKE TO GO?

17:57.310 --> 18:01.848
ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS
ONE MEASLY, LITTLE WEEK

18:01.914 --> 18:05.218
AT ONE MEASLY,
LITTLE LAKE.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.253
BUT THAT'S
TOO MUCH.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.687
CARL!
WHAT?

18:07.754 --> 18:08.988
CORK IT!

18:09.055 --> 18:11.524
WE ALREADY MADE
A RESERVATION.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.726
YOU ALREADY MADE
A RESERVATION.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.096
TYPICAL.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.366
WELL, LET'S SEE
WHAT HELLHOLE

ME TO THIS TIME.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.573

18:28.741 --> 18:29.976
YES.

18:30.042 --> 18:33.045
WE ALL DECIDED
THAT IT WOULD BE NICE

18:33.112 --> 18:36.983
IF FOR ONCE WE WENT
WHERE YOU WANTED TO GO.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.118
WELL...

18:39.186 --> 18:41.020
GEE, THANKS, GUYS.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.555
THAT'S SWELL.

18:44.657 --> 18:48.060
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN SO GRACIOUS

18:48.127 --> 18:50.463
ABOUT NOT GETTING
YOUR OWN WAY.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.501
WELL, THAT'S JUST
THE KIND OF GUY I AM.

18:59.105 --> 19:04.444
I THINK I'L GO TO THE KITCHEN
AND MAKE US ALL SOME TRAIL MIX.

19:30.437 --> 19:33.172
MY WHOLE BODY HURTS.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.575
EVEN MY EYELASHES HURT.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.278
AND I THINK MY TONGUE
NEED A SHAVE.

19:40.146 --> 19:42.215
OH, BUCK UP STEVE.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.784
I AM FIXING YOU
A SURE-FIRE HANGOVER REMEDY.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.554
THIS WILL EITHER KILL YOU,
OR KILL YOU.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.223
EITHER WAY, I'LL BE BETTER OFF.

[BLENDER ROARS]

19:53.226 --> 19:54.494

OH! OH!

19:57.063 --> 19:59.766
SORRY.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.268
OHH.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.071
STEVE,
YOU HAVE MY SYMPATHY.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.506
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

20:06.573 --> 20:09.576
REALLY? TELL ME
ABOUT IT, CARL.

20:09.642 --> 20:10.643
WELL--

20:10.710 --> 20:11.944
QUIETLY.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.616
THE NIGHT I GRADUATED FROM
THE POLICE ACADEMY,

20:16.683 --> 20:19.419
ME AND MY BUDDIES
DECIDED TO TIE ONE ON.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.688
WELL, MOST OF
THE NIGHT IS A BLUR,

20:21.754 --> 20:23.356
BUT DAWN FOUND ME

20:23.423 --> 20:25.725
RIDING A COW DOWN

20:30.930 --> 20:31.931
OHH.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.836
NEVER SNORT
WITH A HANGOVER.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.473
I JUST BLEW MY ADENOIDS
OUT THE BACK OF MY HEAD.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.610
AS GOD
IS MY WITNESS,

20:43.676 --> 20:46.012
LIQUOR WILL NEVER TOUCH
THESE LIPS AGAIN.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.514

20:53.353 --> 20:54.687
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
CARL.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.222
IT SMELLS RANCID.

20:56.289 --> 20:57.590
WELL, THAT MEANS
IT'S READY.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.759
GO AHEAD.
DOWN THE HATCH.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.304

21:12.872 --> 21:13.940
YEAH.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.476

THE VERDICT?

21:19.779 --> 21:22.515
HEY, NOT BAD.

21:24.216 --> 21:25.785
RATHER TASTY.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.656

IT DID THE TRICK.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.528
UH-OH.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.530
STEVE,
WHAT'S WRONG?

21:37.597 --> 21:39.532
I THINK IT JUST
DID ANOTHER TRICK.
