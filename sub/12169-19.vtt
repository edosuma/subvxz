00:01.367 --> 00:03.085
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis :</i>

00:03.247 --> 00:05.317
What’s the nature
of Major Sheppard’s injury ?

00:05.487 --> 00:08.285
Some sort of funky alien bug
attached itself to his neck.

00:08.447 --> 00:10.278
Part of Ellia is human...

00:10.447 --> 00:12.915
... part of her
comes from the Iratus bug.

00:13.087 --> 00:14.918
- She took the retrovirus.
- It wasn’t ready.

00:15.087 --> 00:16.964
It’s not. Not by a long shot.

00:17.967 --> 00:20.481
You’ve been infected
with the Iratus bug retrovirus.

00:20.647 --> 00:22.046
It’s beginning to alter his DNA.

00:22.207 --> 00:24.482
He’Il devolve into a creature
similar to Ellia.

00:24.647 --> 00:26.638
l’m not safe to be around anymore.

00:30.247 --> 00:33.717
<i>Eyes straight ahead. Focus on me.</i>

00:34.287 --> 00:37.882
Never, ever look away
from your enemy.

00:38.047 --> 00:41.278
Shows weakness. Are you weak ?

00:43.167 --> 00:46.955
- No ?
- Good. Are you ready ?

00:50.007 --> 00:52.601
McKay, what did l say ?
Don’t take your eyes off of me.

00:52.767 --> 00:55.156
Gotta anticipate the next move.

00:55.647 --> 00:57.126
You all right ?

00:57.287 --> 01:00.040
Yeah, well, l’m trying to ease up
so l don’t hurt you.

01:00.567 --> 01:02.319
- You’re getting better.
- Really ?

01:03.007 --> 01:04.679
No.

01:07.847 --> 01:10.998
- How’re the ninja lessons going, Jet Li ?
- What do you want ?

01:11.447 --> 01:14.883
- We lost contact with the Taranans.
- You mean the volcano people ?

01:15.047 --> 01:17.083
- Super volcano people.
- What happened to them ?

01:17.687 --> 01:21.282
- Well, we don’t know.
- Seeing how we lost contact with them.

01:21.447 --> 01:23.915
They check in from time to time
from their settlement.

01:24.087 --> 01:26.317
We’ve been sending them food,
medical supplies.

01:26.487 --> 01:29.684
<i>It’s the least we can do
since getting the Orion blown up.</i>

01:29.847 --> 01:31.485
We haven’t heard from them
in months.

01:31.647 --> 01:33.922
l tried to contact them by radio,
but no response.

01:34.087 --> 01:35.600
- So send a M.A.L.P.
- We just did.

01:35.767 --> 01:38.281
Looks okay, but the settlement’s
a couple kilometers...

01:38.447 --> 01:40.483
... from the gate,
so we don’t know anything.

01:40.967 --> 01:43.800
- l want you to check it out.
- What ?

01:49.087 --> 01:51.043
Eyes, yes.

01:51.207 --> 01:53.437
May wanna change first.

02:07.807 --> 02:10.082
They got a lot done
in the time they’ve been here.

02:10.247 --> 02:11.521
They’re hard-working people.

02:11.687 --> 02:14.599
l’ve made several trips
to assist them in getting settled.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.997
This is Lieutenant John Sheppard
from Atlantis...

02:17.167 --> 02:21.319
... calling anyone in
the Taranan settlement. Please respond.

02:24.167 --> 02:28.160
l thought l’d give it a shot.
All right, let’s go.

02:40.487 --> 02:42.796
Anybody home ?

02:42.967 --> 02:45.435
Well, it looks like
they abandoned the place.

02:45.607 --> 02:48.041
Well, maybe they found
somewhere better to live.

02:48.207 --> 02:51.199
They left everything behind.
Why would they do that ?

02:51.367 --> 02:53.278
Let’s get
these workstations powered up.

02:53.447 --> 02:56.120
Maybe we can figure out
where these people went.

02:57.527 --> 03:01.042
- l got something. A single life sign.
- Where is it ?

03:01.207 --> 03:03.163
It’s below us.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.677
- Quite a way below us.
- They built underground ?

03:08.847 --> 03:10.883
No. One of the previous
civilizations here...

03:11.047 --> 03:13.242
... was similar to the Genii,
living below surface...

03:13.407 --> 03:14.556
... to avoid detection by the Wraith.

03:14.727 --> 03:16.922
They left behind several
underground passages...

03:17.087 --> 03:20.204
- ... but the Taranans didn’t utilize them.
- Well, someone is.

03:21.527 --> 03:22.801
How do we get there ?

03:33.927 --> 03:35.599
Rodney ?

04:05.367 --> 04:06.356
Wait.

04:09.887 --> 04:13.118
- What is that ?
- It looks like a cocoon of some sort.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.322
What’s inside it ?

04:15.367 --> 04:20.315
Well, whatever it is,
it’s not inside anymore.

05:36.407 --> 05:38.716
Has Sheppard’s team
dialed in with a status report ?

05:38.887 --> 05:41.082
Not yet, but they haven’t been
gone that long.

05:41.247 --> 05:43.317
Go ahead and dial them.

05:46.607 --> 05:47.926
<i>How’s it going there ?</i>

05:48.087 --> 05:50.806
Well, l think l know
why we lost contact with the Taranans.

05:50.967 --> 05:52.844
<i>- Why ?
- They’re gone.</i>

05:53.007 --> 05:55.965
<i>- What ? All of them ?
- Looks like it.</i>

05:56.127 --> 05:57.719
The entire settlement is deserted.

05:57.887 --> 06:00.481
Rodney’s picked up a life sign
underneath the tunnel...

06:00.647 --> 06:03.400
... but we’re tracking it.
We don’t think it’s human, though.

06:04.247 --> 06:06.397
<i>- Why not ?
- We discovered a large cocoon...</i>

06:06.567 --> 06:08.046
<i>... in one of the rooms underneath.</i>

06:08.207 --> 06:10.880
We think whatever hatched from it
is what we’re detecting.

06:11.447 --> 06:12.880
Did you just say cocoon ?

06:13.047 --> 06:15.436
- Yeah, it’s like a big slimy--
- It’s a pod.

06:15.607 --> 06:18.963
l was gonna say egg,
but who knows what the hell it is.

06:19.527 --> 06:21.643
<i>- l’m sending in backup.
- We can handle it.</i>

06:21.807 --> 06:24.002
l know you can,
but l’d rather be safe than sorry.

06:24.167 --> 06:25.919
l’Il send a team of Marines to assist.

06:26.087 --> 06:30.000
- All right, if you feel the need.
- l feel the need. Weir out.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.602
It’s a hell of a complex down here.

06:36.767 --> 06:37.882
It’s like a maze.

06:38.047 --> 06:40.277
- We’re closer.
- How far ?

06:40.447 --> 06:43.598
Forty meters. It stopped moving,
so we’re gaining ground.

06:43.767 --> 06:47.123
All right, good.
Look, if it makes any sudden moves...

06:47.287 --> 06:49.562
... l want you to make sure that--

06:51.167 --> 06:53.078
Where’s Ronon ?

06:53.767 --> 06:57.157
- Ronon.
- In here.

07:06.447 --> 07:08.358
Oh, my God.

07:10.847 --> 07:11.836
Taranans.

07:19.767 --> 07:23.442
Wounds on their neck. All of them.

07:25.047 --> 07:29.199
- Does this look familiar ?
- Looks disturbingly familiar.

07:29.367 --> 07:31.517
You don’t think--

07:35.767 --> 07:36.756
Ronon ?

07:37.967 --> 07:39.525
Oh, for God’s sakes.

07:39.687 --> 07:42.485
- Ronon.
- In here.

07:45.127 --> 07:48.676
You can’t wander off like that.
You gotta--

07:50.167 --> 07:51.759
Oh, no.

07:52.487 --> 07:53.522
The Iratus bug.

07:53.687 --> 07:55.166
l hate those things.

07:55.327 --> 07:57.477
That explains why the wounds
look so familiar.

07:57.647 --> 08:00.480
What’s it doing here ? Iratus
aren’t indigenous to this planet.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.682
Somebody brought it.

08:01.847 --> 08:03.838
Let’s hope it’s the only bug
they brought.

08:04.367 --> 08:06.597
So some kind of a Wraith experiment ?

08:06.767 --> 08:08.678
l doubt the Taranans
did it to themselves.

08:08.847 --> 08:11.441
l do not sense
any Wraith in the settlement.

08:11.607 --> 08:13.802
Oh, our little friend is on the move.

08:13.967 --> 08:15.764
- It’s headed right for us.
- How fast ?

08:15.927 --> 08:17.406
- Very fast.
- It knows we’re here.

08:17.567 --> 08:18.795
Ronon, stun.

08:18.967 --> 08:20.639
- Why ?
- Stun.

08:36.647 --> 08:38.638
<i>Colonel Sheppard, come in.</i>

08:41.287 --> 08:44.039
Colonel Sheppard,
this is Lieutenant Negley. Do you copy ?

08:44.887 --> 08:46.206
Yes, lieutenant.

08:46.367 --> 08:48.005
My team has come through the gate...

08:48.167 --> 08:49.725
... and we’re proceeding
to the settlement--

08:49.887 --> 08:50.876
<i>Great, terrific.</i>

08:51.047 --> 08:52.685
We’Il meet you there.

08:52.847 --> 08:56.522
Right now l need radio silence.
Sheppard out.

08:57.687 --> 08:58.802
It stopped.

09:00.087 --> 09:02.203
- Why ?
- How am l supposed to know ?

09:02.367 --> 09:05.200
- Where is it ?
- Well, l think it’s out in the tunnel.

09:25.887 --> 09:27.684
It’s close.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.719
- Are you all right ?
- Yeah, l’m good.

10:15.887 --> 10:19.721
- What the hell was that thing ?
- What is that ?

10:22.487 --> 10:24.557
That’s a piece of an arm, it looks like.

10:24.727 --> 10:26.797
Let’s hope that slows him down.

10:26.967 --> 10:31.279
- Well, maybe it’Il bleed to death.
- Or just grow another arm.

10:40.487 --> 10:41.806
Dart.

10:47.407 --> 10:48.726
Still moving away from us.

10:48.887 --> 10:51.481
Let’s hope losing
a chunk of his arm slows him down.

10:51.647 --> 10:54.844
- We need to finish it off to make sure.
- Couldn’t agree with you more.

10:55.007 --> 10:56.122
How are we gonna do that ?

10:56.287 --> 10:58.403
l noticed that our bullets
had no effect on it.

10:58.567 --> 11:00.364
It appears to have a shell on its back.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.883
Set that thing to » kill » again.
Lieutenant Negley, this is Sheppard.

11:04.047 --> 11:06.277
How far away
from the settlement are you ?

11:07.407 --> 11:09.637
Negley, this is Sheppard. Come in.

11:09.807 --> 11:14.244
- You did say radio silence.
- Negley, respond.

11:15.847 --> 11:17.644
Great.

11:19.727 --> 11:21.683
It’s through that doorway.

11:55.607 --> 11:57.916
This is not good.

12:02.207 --> 12:04.437
Dr. Weir, we just received
a data transmission...

12:04.607 --> 12:06.040
... from the Taranan settlement.

12:06.207 --> 12:08.801
- Lieutenant Negley checking in.
- And how are they doing ?

12:08.967 --> 12:10.958
They’ve contacted
Colonel Sheppard’s team...

12:11.127 --> 12:13.516
... who are 10 kilometers
inland from the settlement.

12:13.687 --> 12:15.837
Negley’s on his way
to meet up with them.

12:16.007 --> 12:18.157
Ten kilometers inland ?
What are they doing there ?

12:18.327 --> 12:19.396
They found the Taranans.

12:19.567 --> 12:22.559
They’ve abandoned their settlement
for a better location inland.

12:22.727 --> 12:25.446
What about the cocoon,
and the life sign they were tracking ?

12:25.607 --> 12:28.599
There’s no mention about it.
It was a brief transmission.

12:28.767 --> 12:32.362
- They were almost out of range.
- Okay, good. Keep me posted.

12:38.127 --> 12:40.721
We searched the whole room.
That thing ain’t in there.

12:40.887 --> 12:42.923
- Just a bunch of unhatched eggs.
- Pods.

12:43.087 --> 12:45.555
- Whatever.
- Is there another way out ?

12:45.727 --> 12:47.445
No, that’s the only door to the room.

12:47.607 --> 12:50.997
Well, they must’ve found another
way out, because it is still on the move.

12:51.167 --> 12:52.395
<i>Alien.</i>

12:55.207 --> 12:57.118
<i>The movie Alien.
They use the air shafts...</i>

12:57.287 --> 12:59.243
- ... to move around.
- And then killed...

12:59.407 --> 13:01.682
... the crew, one by one.
Thanks for bringing it up.

13:01.847 --> 13:02.996
It didn’t kill them all.

13:03.167 --> 13:05.806
- What do we do now ?
- Track this thing down and kill it.

13:05.967 --> 13:09.039
Agreed, but first things first.

13:15.727 --> 13:22.075
- The structure is very peculiar.
- Yeah. l believe the word is » disgusting. »

13:37.567 --> 13:39.922
Go, go, go.
Sheppard, they’re hatching !

13:40.087 --> 13:41.406
We’re good. Let’s go.

13:44.647 --> 13:46.239
Shut the door.

13:54.247 --> 13:55.316
Fire in the hole.

14:02.367 --> 14:04.085
- Everyone okay ?
- Yes.

14:04.247 --> 14:07.922
- l’m good.
- l think you singed my eyebrows.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.923
Think you used
enough dynamite there, Butch ?

14:24.487 --> 14:26.045
Rodney ?

14:27.407 --> 14:30.205
- l think we got them all.
- Well, that’s good.

14:30.367 --> 14:32.801
Except for our armless friend.
He’s still on the move.

14:32.967 --> 14:34.685
Let’s go get him.

14:43.527 --> 14:46.678
Lieutenant Negley, this is Sheppard.
Do you read ?

14:47.807 --> 14:50.685
Negley, respond.

14:51.407 --> 14:53.967
- Damn it.
- Perhaps they encountered the creature.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.118
- And what, killed all four of them ?
- No way.

14:56.287 --> 14:58.403
One creature
isn’t gonna take out four Marines.

14:58.567 --> 15:00.956
- It almost killed all of us.
- But it didn’t.

15:01.127 --> 15:03.163
- We need to find them.
- If they were alive...

15:03.327 --> 15:05.238
... we’d see them
on the life-sign detector.

15:05.407 --> 15:06.522
Not if they didn’t make it
to the settlement.

15:06.687 --> 15:09.804
- This thing has a range of 100 meters.
- Where’s the creature now ?

15:10.447 --> 15:12.039
Wait a minute.

15:13.447 --> 15:15.642
- It’s back that way.
- Behind us ?

15:15.807 --> 15:17.559
- You just said it was that way.
- l did.

15:17.727 --> 15:19.718
Well, it was,
but it must’ve doubled back.

15:19.887 --> 15:21.161
Damn air shafts.

15:21.327 --> 15:23.716
It knows its way around this place
better than we do.

15:23.887 --> 15:25.718
We should consider
returning to the gate.

15:26.167 --> 15:28.476
- What, you mean give up ?
- No, not give up.

15:28.647 --> 15:31.719
Find out what happened to the Marines,
request additional backup...

15:31.887 --> 15:33.605
... so that we may do a proper search.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.997
l like this plan.
l mean, if we’re taking a vote.

15:36.167 --> 15:38.761
- Sounds like giving up to me.
- Teyla’s right.

15:38.927 --> 15:40.519
Enough of this. We’re better off...

15:40.687 --> 15:43.963
- ... doing a full-scale sweep of this area.
- Including the air shafts.

15:44.127 --> 15:47.563
- All right, how do we get out of here ?
- This way.

15:50.727 --> 15:54.037
In all the worlds l’ve been to,
l’ve never encountered anything like it.

15:54.207 --> 15:55.925
Did anybody get a look at that thing ?

15:56.087 --> 15:59.318
Aside from its severed appendage, no.
That thing moved incredibly fast.

15:59.487 --> 16:00.886
It looked almost like a human.

16:01.047 --> 16:04.244
If by human you mean clad in a
grotesquely proportioned exoskeleton...

16:04.407 --> 16:05.681
... yes, very human.

16:05.847 --> 16:07.838
It looked like
it had two arms and two legs.

16:08.007 --> 16:10.885
It looked like a giant bug to me.
l hate those things.

16:11.047 --> 16:12.844
If it was indeed a Wraith experiment...

16:13.007 --> 16:15.441
... perhaps it was created
by combining the elements...

16:15.607 --> 16:17.359
... of the Iratus bug
with the Taranans.

16:17.527 --> 16:19.916
Which is, as we know,
exactly how the Wraith evolved.

16:20.087 --> 16:22.840
The Iratus bug bites human,
human DNA mixes with theirs...

16:23.007 --> 16:24.599
... a thousand years go by, Wraith.

16:24.767 --> 16:26.564
So they’re trying
to create more Wraith ?

16:26.727 --> 16:29.161
Doesn’t make sense.
If they wanted to create Wraith...

16:29.327 --> 16:32.160
... wouldn’t it be easier
to get a male and female, get a room ?

16:32.327 --> 16:34.158
It doesn’t work that way
with the Wraith.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.840
At least, we don’t think it does.

16:36.007 --> 16:38.919
We’re not entirely sure
as to the Wraith’s reproductive methods.

16:39.087 --> 16:41.123
l don’t wanna be around
to watch that film.

16:41.287 --> 16:42.925
Anyway, look.

16:43.087 --> 16:46.318
It’s probably less likely they were
trying to create another Wraith...

16:46.487 --> 16:49.001
... than they were trying to create
a hybrid creature...

16:49.167 --> 16:54.560
- ... probably to use as a weapon.
- Super Wraith ? That’s all we need.

16:57.207 --> 16:59.402
That’s the whole distance
from the settlement...

16:59.567 --> 17:01.478
... and l don’t see any sign
of the Marines.

17:01.647 --> 17:04.638
- Maybe they went back to Atlantis.
- No, they would’ve radioed us.

17:04.807 --> 17:06.205
They encountered the creature.

17:06.367 --> 17:08.800
There’s no explanation
for why they’re not responding.

17:08.967 --> 17:13.085
If that thing took them all out,
then that is one nasty bug person.

17:13.247 --> 17:15.840
- Dial us out.
- Right.

17:20.047 --> 17:21.366
- No.
- What ?

17:21.527 --> 17:24.564
No, no, no.

17:24.727 --> 17:28.640
- Rodney ?
- The control crystal’s missing.

17:29.167 --> 17:30.805
- Missing ?
- We can’t dial out ?

17:30.967 --> 17:35.358
- Well, fix it.
- This is not a matter of fixing, okay ?

17:35.527 --> 17:36.846
The crystal is just gone.

17:37.007 --> 17:39.840
Someone has removed it
to prevent anyone from dialing out.

18:19.447 --> 18:20.436
Stay here ?

18:20.607 --> 18:22.802
Élizabeth will wonder
why we haven’t checked in.

18:22.967 --> 18:24.878
She’Il dial up,
we can request backup...

18:25.047 --> 18:26.560
... also, a Puddle Jumper to come.

18:26.727 --> 18:28.843
We don’t know how long it’d be.
Could be hours.

18:29.007 --> 18:32.079
We’Il be safe. The detector
will alert us if the creature’s nearby.

18:32.247 --> 18:35.637
Right. We can set up a-- What do you
call it ? A perimeter. Wait it out.

18:36.967 --> 18:39.003
We’re not leaving
without those Marines.

18:40.647 --> 18:42.319
Let’s go back to the settlement.

18:59.367 --> 19:02.040
- What ?
- l am sensing something.

19:02.207 --> 19:04.675
- Wraith ?
- l cannot be certain.

19:04.847 --> 19:06.485
Rodney ?

19:08.127 --> 19:12.962
No, l’ve still just got the one reading.
He’s still on the move, heading-- No.

19:14.167 --> 19:17.284
No, l’m picking up another life sign.
It’s popped up out of nowhere.

19:17.447 --> 19:20.007
- How is that possible ?
- Maybe one of those eggs hatched.

19:20.167 --> 19:22.635
Maybe. That,
or part of the settlement is shielded.

19:22.807 --> 19:26.595
- Maybe it’s one of the Marines.
- Well, if it is one of those Marines...

19:26.767 --> 19:30.203
... that something Teyla’s sensing
is heading right toward him.

19:42.407 --> 19:43.396
We’re close.

20:10.087 --> 20:11.918
What was that ?

20:12.087 --> 20:15.124
- Teyla.
- Teyla.

20:25.887 --> 20:27.559
Ronon.

20:31.567 --> 20:33.319
John.

21:12.207 --> 21:13.765
Where’d she go ?

21:15.087 --> 21:17.317
l’m reading two life signs
moving away from us...

21:17.487 --> 21:20.001
... but one floor up, l think.
That, or more air shafts.

21:20.167 --> 21:21.600
Let’s go.

21:23.127 --> 21:24.606
Wait.

21:25.527 --> 21:27.199
They disappeared.

21:27.727 --> 21:29.365
- What ?
- The life signs just vanished.

21:29.527 --> 21:32.166
l was right. Part of this settlement
must be shielded.

21:32.327 --> 21:35.000
Wait. No, we won’t be able
to track them.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.957
- What-- ?
- This will proceed much more quickly...

21:51.127 --> 21:53.004
... if you don’t resist.

21:53.167 --> 21:54.919
Michael ?

21:56.047 --> 21:57.958
Hello, Teyla.

22:00.207 --> 22:02.357
Aim for the stomach.
Seems more vulnerable.

22:02.527 --> 22:03.562
It’s a soft underbelly.

22:03.727 --> 22:06.525
- You were able to kill it there before.
- Thanks.

22:07.007 --> 22:07.996
Which way ?

22:08.167 --> 22:11.239
l don’t know, it’s not
showing me anything. It’s useless.

22:11.407 --> 22:13.796
- Yeah.
- This way.

22:16.287 --> 22:20.565
- You are the one who’s done all this ?
- All this ?

22:20.727 --> 22:24.561
This experiment.

22:25.367 --> 22:28.723
You murdered those people.
You allowed those bugs to feed on them.

22:28.887 --> 22:31.117
A necessary step in the process.

22:31.927 --> 22:35.761
To create these creatures ?
Why are you doing this ?

22:36.767 --> 22:38.917
Do you not recall our last encounter ?

22:39.767 --> 22:42.679
How you left me to die
on that desolate planet ?

22:43.167 --> 22:48.241
The hive that finally rescued me,
they could tell something was different.

22:48.407 --> 22:50.523
They sensed the human in me.

22:50.687 --> 22:55.283
To them l was unclean.

23:00.007 --> 23:02.965
l barely escaped that hive with my life.

23:06.847 --> 23:10.317
So now l find myself hunted
by both humans and Wraith...

23:12.567 --> 23:16.480
... so you can understand
my need to protect myself...

23:16.647 --> 23:20.003
... to survive.

23:22.127 --> 23:26.564
It did not have to be like this.
You could have lived with us.

23:27.047 --> 23:28.400
As a human ?

23:29.487 --> 23:33.844
My consciousness erased
by your retrovirus ? No.

23:34.327 --> 23:37.000
l will live the rest of my life
as l choose...

23:38.527 --> 23:39.960
... but l can’t do it alone.

23:40.647 --> 23:42.842
So having taken my cue...

23:43.007 --> 23:46.204
... from the experiment
your people performed on me...

23:47.607 --> 23:50.644
... l figured out
how to reverse the process.

23:50.807 --> 23:55.722
To create a being
even more formidable than a Wraith.

23:56.327 --> 23:58.079
It began with the feeding.

24:01.247 --> 24:03.636
<i>I allowed the bug to gorge itself...</i>

24:03.807 --> 24:07.004
<i>... to absorb as much human DNA
as possible.</i>

24:07.807 --> 24:11.766
<i>This, of course,
led to the death of the subject.</i>

24:13.327 --> 24:15.443
<i>The timing of the feeding
was critical...</i>

24:15.607 --> 24:18.405
<i>... ensuring that the bug
laid its next egg quickly...</i>

24:18.567 --> 24:22.446
<i>... before the genetic material
could filter out of its body.</i>

24:27.967 --> 24:32.119
<i>The embryo then contained enough
human DNA for me to manipulate.</i>

24:36.567 --> 24:38.523
<i>I accelerated the development...</i>

24:38.687 --> 24:41.884
<i>... augmenting the complexity
of its physiology.</i>

24:42.607 --> 24:47.397
<i>There were several adjustments,
several mistakes...</i>

24:48.007 --> 24:50.123
<i>... until I finally found
the perfect balance...</i>

24:50.287 --> 24:55.919
<i>... between strength, agility
and resilience.</i>

24:59.287 --> 25:02.518
A perfect animal to do my bidding.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.439
Must be some kind
of security lockdown.

25:22.607 --> 25:24.086
Whoever took Teyla triggered it.

25:24.247 --> 25:26.397
- We gotta open this up.
- Stand back.

25:26.567 --> 25:29.206
Jeez, you mind giving us
a little more heads up...

25:29.367 --> 25:31.881
... before you start blasting everything ?

25:34.087 --> 25:36.043
You got any more C-4 ?

25:37.527 --> 25:41.725
l saw how you and your team
destroyed the incubation room.

25:42.687 --> 25:45.645
But don’t think
that’s the only one in this complex.

25:45.807 --> 25:47.684
Don’t think this is the only planet...

25:47.847 --> 25:50.407
... from which l’m conducting
this experiment.

25:51.127 --> 25:52.355
That’s right.

25:52.527 --> 25:55.485
Soon, hundreds of these creatures
will be at my disposal...

25:55.647 --> 25:58.115
... and their numbers
will continue to grow...

25:58.287 --> 26:01.245
... so long as l have
human subjects in supply.

26:01.407 --> 26:05.719
And now that you’re here, l do.

26:15.567 --> 26:19.845
All right, that’s the last of the C-4.
Let’s hope it’s enough.

26:20.007 --> 26:21.440
Ready ?

26:23.847 --> 26:25.439
What happened ?

26:32.487 --> 26:34.796
All right, let’s go.

26:44.287 --> 26:46.596
- Serious energy spike.
- What does that mean ?

26:46.767 --> 26:49.725
We probably just entered
the shielded section of the settlement.

26:59.447 --> 27:01.802
Your friends are coming for you.

27:06.047 --> 27:09.244
They’Il meet the same fate as you,
one by one.

27:09.407 --> 27:10.920
Others will come for us.

27:11.087 --> 27:13.760
- Weir will send--
- Don’t concern yourself with Dr. Weir.

27:14.367 --> 27:18.076
She thinks your team has met up
with the Taranan people and all is well.

27:19.207 --> 27:21.482
One of the Marines
she sent to help you was...

27:23.287 --> 27:26.836
... kind enough to assist me in
transmitting a message back to Atlantis.

27:29.487 --> 27:32.718
Michael, please don’t do this.

27:33.167 --> 27:39.117
After what you did to me, twice,
how could you expect anything less ?

27:40.007 --> 27:42.805
- What happened back on the planet--
- No more excuses.

27:42.967 --> 27:46.482
Your experiment failed,
you decided to kill us.

27:46.647 --> 27:48.444
We believed we were left
with no choice.

27:48.607 --> 27:50.643
And now l’m in the same position.

27:52.447 --> 27:53.960
You drove me to this.

28:05.167 --> 28:07.123
Oh, my God.

28:15.167 --> 28:16.919
Where are the others ?

28:21.727 --> 28:23.877
Sheppard, over here.

28:37.767 --> 28:38.756
You hear that ?

28:41.247 --> 28:43.841
Oh, it sounds like bugs.

28:44.007 --> 28:45.599
Come on.

28:55.767 --> 28:56.756
Put that thing away.

28:56.927 --> 28:58.645
You said it didn’t work in this area.

28:58.807 --> 29:01.605
l thought l could recalibrate it
to take into effect the--

29:22.367 --> 29:24.005
It’s dead.

29:34.887 --> 29:36.525
John.

29:37.807 --> 29:39.638
John !

29:42.247 --> 29:44.238
Nice shot. You okay ?

29:44.407 --> 29:46.796
Yes. It’s Michael.
He’s the one doing this.

29:46.967 --> 29:48.480
Michael ? Our Michael ?

29:48.647 --> 29:50.046
- He’s alive ?
- Yes.

29:50.207 --> 29:52.880
He created creatures.
He’s attempting to build an army.

29:53.047 --> 29:54.036
- Where is he ?
- l don’t know.

29:54.207 --> 29:57.438
- He ran off when he heard the gunfire.
- We need to come up with a plan.

29:57.607 --> 29:59.245
- Best plan is to kill him.
- Hang on.

29:59.407 --> 30:01.875
l should check out these stations.
Might be intel.

30:02.047 --> 30:03.844
- No time.
- Such as how many creatures...

30:04.007 --> 30:05.360
... he created,
if they have weaknesses...

30:05.527 --> 30:07.358
... that we might be able to exploit.

30:07.887 --> 30:09.798
All right. Teyla, you stay with Rodney.

30:09.967 --> 30:11.639
Ronon and l are going after Michael.

30:11.807 --> 30:13.604
- Stay in touch on the radio.
- Can’t.

30:13.767 --> 30:15.405
Shielded, remember ?

30:15.567 --> 30:17.762
The energy spike,
it fouls the communications.

30:17.927 --> 30:20.760
Well, then unshield it. Let’s go.

30:27.007 --> 30:28.599
You go that way, l’Il go the other.

30:28.767 --> 30:31.406
- Oh, hey, wait. Set your gun to » stun. »
- What ?

30:31.567 --> 30:33.205
We’re gonna need to question him.

30:33.367 --> 30:34.595
No talking, no questioning.

30:34.767 --> 30:36.598
l’m gonna do
what we should’ve done the first time.

30:36.767 --> 30:38.837
- Ronon, listen to me--
- No, you listen to me.

30:39.007 --> 30:42.124
The retrovirus was a mistake.
l said it then, no one listened to me.

30:42.287 --> 30:44.847
- It was a bad idea.
- We had to try.

30:45.007 --> 30:47.965
- If it worked, we wouldn’t have--
- But it didn’t work.

30:48.127 --> 30:52.325
Admit it, it just made things worse.

30:52.487 --> 30:55.524
How long
do you wanna keep paying for it ?

31:00.127 --> 31:01.446
It’s amazing how much work...

31:01.607 --> 31:04.167
... he’s been able to get done
in a short amount of time.

31:04.327 --> 31:08.115
He’s quite the industrious little fella,
or Wraith, or whatever.

31:08.287 --> 31:10.801
What does he look like now ?
Is he full-on Wraith again ?

31:10.967 --> 31:12.161
Not quite.

31:12.327 --> 31:14.966
There are still human characteristics
present in him.

31:15.127 --> 31:18.119
No doubt it’s why l was confused
when l first felt his presence.

31:18.687 --> 31:22.316
You would think that the human side of
him would temper his aggression a bit.

31:22.487 --> 31:24.921
Yes, because we humans
aren’t aggressive at all.

31:25.087 --> 31:30.286
Well, certainly less aggressive than--
Oh, sarcasm. Yeah. Nice.

31:30.447 --> 31:32.722
What Michael is doing right now
must be stopped...

31:32.887 --> 31:35.481
... and he can’t be allowed to escape.
He’s too dangerous.

31:35.647 --> 31:38.923
- Preaching to the choir, my dear.
- But l understand his anger.

31:39.887 --> 31:43.675
His life has been destroyed.
He no longer has a home, or family.

31:43.847 --> 31:46.407
- He had a family ?
- l don’t know.

31:46.567 --> 31:49.445
l’ve wondered what he left behind
when he was captured by us.

31:49.607 --> 31:52.724
We know nothing of his past,
other than he was a Wraith.

31:52.887 --> 31:56.721
- A very smart Wraith.
- Perhaps he was a scientist.

31:56.887 --> 31:59.242
Yeah, sure, probably. Why not ?

31:59.407 --> 32:02.319
- One of their very best, l would wager.
- Like you.

32:04.167 --> 32:06.965
Right. Wait a minute.

32:07.607 --> 32:09.006
- What is it ?
- l think...

32:09.167 --> 32:12.955
... l figured out how to disable the EM
interference that is causing the shielding.

32:13.127 --> 32:15.641
- Sheppard, you there ?
- Yeah, l’m here.

32:15.807 --> 32:19.516
<i>- I got the shielding disabled.
- So l see.</i>

32:20.367 --> 32:23.837
- Any luck finding Michael ?
- No sign of him yet.

32:24.007 --> 32:27.602
- That life-sign detector working yet ?
- Of course.

32:31.807 --> 32:34.605
- Oh, my God.
- What ?

32:35.607 --> 32:37.643
l’m reading
a ton of life signs near you.

32:37.807 --> 32:40.719
Well, define » ton, » and define » near. »

32:41.167 --> 32:43.761
A few dozen ?
l mean, they’re all bunched together.

32:44.247 --> 32:47.557
- Prisoners in a holding cell, maybe ?
- Or worse.

33:03.247 --> 33:05.442
Whatever they are,
someone just released them...

33:05.607 --> 33:09.122
- ... and they’re headed your way.
- Oh, crap.

33:37.447 --> 33:39.244
Keep going. Straight up the tunnel.

33:39.687 --> 33:42.838
<i>Ronon should be coming around
the corner towards you now.</i>

33:46.207 --> 33:47.799
It’s not Ronon.

33:49.127 --> 33:52.244
- It’s one of the bugs ?
- Michael.

33:57.567 --> 33:58.966
Colonel Sheppard.

33:59.127 --> 34:02.085
No offense, but l was kind of hoping
never to see you again.

34:02.247 --> 34:06.479
- l had hoped just the opposite.
- Well, then.

34:06.647 --> 34:10.925
You’ve seen me.
Now, say your goodbyes...

34:11.487 --> 34:15.525
... but first, give me
the control crystals to the DHD.

34:16.127 --> 34:19.199
- l don’t think so.
- Or l can just kill you.

34:19.367 --> 34:21.641
Unless l stun you first.

34:25.206 --> 34:27.516
As much as l’d like
to sit around chatting--

34:27.687 --> 34:30.645
They’re extraordinary, aren’t they ?

34:31.087 --> 34:33.043
Your army of bug people ?

34:33.206 --> 34:36.358
- l thought you’d be impressed.
- Not so much.

34:36.527 --> 34:40.679
After all, l’m merely continuing
the experiment your people began.

34:40.847 --> 34:43.998
What then ?
Take over the entire galaxy ?

34:44.167 --> 34:46.203
That’s a little too Dr. Évil,
if you ask me.

34:46.367 --> 34:49.757
Sheppard, the creatures are closing in
on you fast. You better get moving.

34:49.927 --> 34:52.202
You and Teyla go to the gate.
l’Il meet you there.

34:52.367 --> 34:53.800
<i>Right.</i>

34:58.127 --> 35:02.200
- Give me the control crystal.
- l can’t do that, colonel.

35:03.647 --> 35:08.437
Just so we’re clear,
l have no problem killing you.

35:17.287 --> 35:20.165
And l have no problem with dying...

35:20.607 --> 35:23.280
... because even
if you kill me right now...

35:24.567 --> 35:29.322
... l’Il die knowing that you and your
team did not get off this planet alive.

35:46.967 --> 35:48.320
Go.

35:50.167 --> 35:51.885
Climbing’s the reason l got bronze...

35:52.047 --> 35:55.403
- ... instead of silver in the program.
- What ?

35:57.047 --> 35:59.277
Hurry, they’re coming.

36:14.127 --> 36:16.118
This is messed up.

36:19.647 --> 36:22.320
- This must be where they got up.
- What ?

36:22.487 --> 36:26.036
Air shafts.
It’s about time we used them.

36:49.127 --> 36:51.243
- Michael’s ?
- No doubt.

36:51.407 --> 36:52.840
You thinking what l’m thinking ?

36:53.007 --> 36:57.603
l fly it, pick you, Rodney and Teyla up.
We use the Dart’s DHD to dial the gate.

36:57.767 --> 37:01.521
l was thinking blow it up,
but your idea’s better. Get moving.

37:28.727 --> 37:30.399
Sheppard !

37:48.407 --> 37:49.556
- Wait.
- What is it ?

37:49.727 --> 37:52.480
- Life signs up ahead.
- Colonel Sheppard ? Ronon ?

37:52.647 --> 37:54.717
Doesn’t sound like it.

37:57.207 --> 38:00.165
Life signs behind us too.
It’s closing in fast.

38:00.327 --> 38:02.238
Oh, God.

38:03.527 --> 38:05.324
We’re surrounded.

38:33.007 --> 38:34.998
Incoming wormhole.

38:37.247 --> 38:40.319
- Colonel Sheppard’s IDC.
- Lower the shield.

38:49.367 --> 38:52.006
Are you all right ?
Where are the Marines ?

38:52.167 --> 38:53.805
- Didn’t make it.
- What ?

38:53.967 --> 38:55.320
We barely made it ourselves.

38:55.487 --> 38:57.443
Had to commandeer
a Wraith Dart to dial out.

38:57.607 --> 38:59.086
We ditched it on another planet.

38:59.247 --> 39:01.283
Didn’t wanna risk
damaging the control room.

39:01.447 --> 39:04.803
<i>- Daedalus can pick it up later.
- What happened to the Taranans ?</i>

39:04.967 --> 39:06.480
They’re dead. All of them.

39:08.207 --> 39:10.038
Wait, Lieutenant Negley
sent a message...

39:10.207 --> 39:12.243
... saying they relocated
to a new settlement.

39:12.407 --> 39:13.442
No, it was Michael.

39:13.607 --> 39:16.644
He sent the transmission.
He’s the one that killed the Taranans.

39:16.807 --> 39:18.559
- Michael ?
- We’Il tell you about it...

39:18.727 --> 39:22.197
<i>- ... but first, is the Daedalus here yet ?
- It’s still a few days out. Why ?</i>

39:22.367 --> 39:25.200
We’re gonna need it
to make another stop on the way.

39:25.367 --> 39:26.766
Okay.

39:40.687 --> 39:43.281
- Élizabeth ?
- l just came from McKay’s lab.

39:43.447 --> 39:45.085
He’s been examining the research...

39:45.247 --> 39:47.761
... he was able to upload
from Michael’s experiment.

39:47.927 --> 39:51.158
Has he been able to determine just
how many more of those creatures...

39:51.327 --> 39:52.726
... Michael was able to create ?

39:52.887 --> 39:55.924
Not an exact figure, but Rodney
believes it’s into the hundreds.

39:56.567 --> 40:01.402
Yeah, and it appears Michael has similar
labs on at least three different planets.

40:02.767 --> 40:07.477
It’s amazing how quickly he’s been able
to incorporate our science into his.

40:09.607 --> 40:12.041
- What is it ?
- Michael found out about...

40:12.207 --> 40:14.402
... the Taranan settlement
through information...

40:14.567 --> 40:16.398
... the Wraith hacked
from our database...

40:16.567 --> 40:19.127
... during our brief alliance
with them last year.

40:20.207 --> 40:22.675
We led Michael straight to them.

40:33.527 --> 40:36.803
Colonel Caldwell just radioed.
They did a full sweep of the planet.

40:36.967 --> 40:39.481
No life signs.
They searched the settlement...

40:39.647 --> 40:41.842
... no Michael, no creatures.

40:42.007 --> 40:44.043
- He already dialed out.
- Yeah.

40:44.927 --> 40:46.963
Got the control crystal back
in the DHD.

40:47.127 --> 40:49.925
Rodney’s trying to figure out
the last address dialed...

40:50.087 --> 40:51.805
... but you know how long that takes.

40:51.967 --> 40:55.118
l’m sure Michael immediately
dialed elsewhere to cover his tracks.

40:55.287 --> 40:58.962
- Yeah, you can count on that.
- We need to find him.

40:59.127 --> 41:00.924
He’s already too dangerous.

41:01.087 --> 41:04.124
And l’m sure
we’re number one on his hit list.
