01:23.516 --> 01:25.183
Hello,
                    Arlene.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.819
Hello,
                           Jose.

01:27.887 --> 01:29.687
Hello, Dwayne.

01:29.755 --> 01:32.557
Hello, Billy.

01:32.625 --> 01:35.493
Hello,
                           Ruby.

01:37.863 --> 01:40.465
A man is nothing
        without friends.

01:41.968 --> 01:43.735
Boy, are you
         in a good mood

01:43.803 --> 01:45.537
today.
                    Yes.

01:45.604 --> 01:46.938
You know that nagging

01:47.006 --> 01:49.774
multiple personalities
         problem I had?

01:49.842 --> 01:50.875
TONY:
Yeah.
             Yeah.

01:50.943 --> 01:53.011
It is gone. I am cured.

01:53.079 --> 01:53.711
You sure, Latka?

01:53.846 --> 01:55.213
Yes.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.914
I knew you would be skeptical,

01:56.982 --> 02:00.084
so I brought my therapist
     so she could meet you.

02:00.152 --> 02:01.019
Yeah?
                      (chuckles)

02:01.087 --> 02:02.287
Please... therapist.

02:02.355 --> 02:03.454
It's probably a witch doctor.

02:03.522 --> 02:05.122
ALEX:
This guy goes to
a therapist like...

02:05.190 --> 02:07.025
Look what you gave me--
          three twos.

02:08.060 --> 02:09.961
ELAINE:
Yikes!

02:13.966 --> 02:14.933
This is
                    Elaine.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.133
Hello.

02:16.201 --> 02:18.236
Hello. I'm Dr. Joyce Brothers.

02:18.303 --> 02:20.137
And this
        is Tony.

02:20.205 --> 02:21.305
Hi, Tony.

02:21.374 --> 02:22.474
And this
is Alex.

02:22.541 --> 02:23.641
Well,
    hello there.

02:23.709 --> 02:24.809
Nice to meet you, Alex.

02:24.877 --> 02:27.245
It is!
        It is!

02:27.312 --> 02:29.146
It's Dr. Joyce
        Brothers!

02:29.215 --> 02:30.248
I got to thank you.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.817
You helped me
get through puberty.

02:32.885 --> 02:33.951
Dr. Brothers,
    sit down, please.

02:34.019 --> 02:35.220
I'd love to,
           thank you.

02:35.288 --> 02:36.388
Join us.

02:36.455 --> 02:37.789
Latka loves you
          all so much.

02:37.856 --> 02:39.424
He wanted me
          to meet you.

02:39.491 --> 02:41.559
How did you come
to treat Latka?

02:41.661 --> 02:44.629
Well, I was on a phone-in
  talk show, and Latka called.

02:44.696 --> 02:46.831
Since I'd
                   never treated
                  his particular

02:46.833 --> 02:48.399
dissociative personality
        disorder before,

02:48.467 --> 02:50.435
I offered to see him regularly.

02:50.502 --> 02:51.703
Huh.
DR. BROTHERS:
I am

02:51.804 --> 02:55.073
very confident that Latka
has the situation under control.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.608
All right, Latka.
                 Way to go, Doc!
                      Fantastic!

02:56.675 --> 02:58.042
Way to go!
           Oh, we're so grateful
           to you, Dr. Brothers.

02:58.110 --> 02:59.310
Well, thank you.

02:59.377 --> 03:01.512
Come on. I will show
               you where I work.

03:01.580 --> 03:02.914
I'd love
                      to see it.

03:02.982 --> 03:05.483
TONY:
                  This is great.
                       Sit down.

03:08.988 --> 03:09.955
(growling)

03:10.022 --> 03:11.222
DR. BROTHERS:
              I'd best be going.

03:12.258 --> 03:14.492
Latka, you have
my telephone number.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.328
Use it whenever
you want to speak to me.

03:17.395 --> 03:18.062
Nice meeting
          all of you.

03:18.197 --> 03:19.363
ELAINE:
                Nice to see you.
Yeah.

03:19.431 --> 03:20.364
LATKA:
Bye-bye.

03:20.432 --> 03:21.499
ALEX:
Dr. Brothers.

03:37.617 --> 03:39.583
Dr. Joyce Brothers?

03:39.652 --> 03:40.985
That's right.

03:41.053 --> 03:42.153
Whoo!

03:42.220 --> 03:43.587
(clears throat)

03:43.655 --> 03:46.357
I have a question
                     to ask you.

03:46.425 --> 03:48.326
What is it?

03:50.463 --> 03:53.130
Are you visiting
                     the garage,

03:53.198 --> 03:56.801
or am I on <i>The</i>
              <i>Merv Griffin show?</i>

03:58.771 --> 04:01.673
We're in the garage.

04:01.740 --> 04:04.208
That's too bad.

04:04.277 --> 04:06.278
'Cause I have a story

04:06.345 --> 04:09.046
that Merv would've loved.

04:15.488 --> 04:17.555
Oh, Latka, it's so good

04:17.623 --> 04:19.255
to have you back
    with us full time.

04:19.324 --> 04:20.423
Yeah. Latka.

04:20.493 --> 04:21.591
Come on,
                       sit down.

04:21.660 --> 04:22.961
TONY:
                          Latka!

04:23.028 --> 04:26.431
You know, eh, Dr. Brothers
     told me it's okay now.

04:26.532 --> 04:28.566
I can lead a normal life,

04:28.634 --> 04:32.303
and, uh, I can go to the job,
  and I can make new friends.

04:33.672 --> 04:35.607
As a matter of fact,

04:35.674 --> 04:39.343
I am going to ask Simka
          to marry me.

04:39.411 --> 04:40.412
Yeah! Yeah!
               That's wonderful.

04:40.479 --> 04:42.113
I love her. She...

04:42.148 --> 04:43.714
ELAINE:
                  Ooh, now, wait
                       a minute.

04:43.782 --> 04:46.017
How come you
             don't look happier?

04:46.085 --> 04:48.019
Because I am not American,

04:48.087 --> 04:50.755
where the wedding is nothing
       but a celebration

04:50.822 --> 04:53.624
for two people
       to being together.

04:53.692 --> 04:55.927
Simka and I are orthodox.

04:55.961 --> 04:58.829
By tradition,
demands

04:58.898 --> 05:01.332
that we go through
       from the proposal

05:01.367 --> 05:03.467
to the last moment
       of the ceremony--

05:03.535 --> 05:05.637
we have to go through a series
           of tests.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.872
And if we
                       fail even

05:07.940 --> 05:10.475
one test,
    we never to be married.

05:10.543 --> 05:12.210
TONY:
                 You're kidding.
             So, why do you guys

05:12.311 --> 05:14.245
put up with this?
LATKA:
Well, because

05:14.313 --> 05:17.115
in my country, there is
   a belief, and rightly so,

05:17.182 --> 05:19.550
that the only thing
       that separates us

05:19.618 --> 05:22.153
from the animals
   are mindless superstition

05:22.220 --> 05:23.955
and pointless rituals.

05:28.126 --> 05:30.595
Well, I don't care
      what you say, Latka.

05:30.662 --> 05:32.830
I think it's great
    you're getting married.

05:32.898 --> 05:34.165
Yeah. Me, too.
Me, too. Yeah!
Great. It's great.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.199
ELAINE:
                      Fantastic.

05:35.267 --> 05:37.368
Good. Then you can
                be my <i>Gewirtzal.</i>

05:37.370 --> 05:38.803
Your <i>Gewirtzal?</i>
                            Yes.

05:38.871 --> 05:40.738
I'd be proud
     to be your <i>Gewirtzal.</i>

05:40.806 --> 05:42.606
What is that? Like a best man?

05:42.674 --> 05:44.842
No, it is the one
   who has to propose for me.

05:44.910 --> 05:46.177
Oh.

05:46.244 --> 05:49.047
Usually it's an old hag
or a leper or the village idiot.

05:49.148 --> 05:51.115
But you'll do
                     in a pinch.

06:00.059 --> 06:02.093
Latka, I just hope
          I remember everything.

06:02.161 --> 06:04.762
I mean, I had to
             learn a lot of, uh,

06:04.830 --> 06:06.998
ancient ritual
               in just one week.

06:07.032 --> 06:08.599
Hmm. Don't worry.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.468
You'll be fine.

06:10.535 --> 06:12.603
Once Simka knows
    that you are proposing,

06:12.671 --> 06:15.640
she will know what to do,
     and she will help you.

06:15.707 --> 06:16.774
Yeah,
                      I hope so.
        (knocking)

06:16.841 --> 06:18.008
Hey, wait
                       a minute.

06:18.077 --> 06:19.243
She's early,
                      isn't she?

06:19.310 --> 06:20.545
That's early,
                       isn't it?

06:20.612 --> 06:21.845
Yes.

06:21.913 --> 06:25.116
Uh, listen, Latka,
                  uh... I, uh...

06:25.184 --> 06:27.851
Good luck, uh,
                  to both of us.

06:34.193 --> 06:36.327
Hello, Latka.

06:40.532 --> 06:43.067
I'm ready
                   for our date.

06:43.135 --> 06:45.002
Hello, Simka.

06:47.172 --> 06:49.340
I have a special
surprise for you.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.142
Oh, boy. What is it?

06:51.209 --> 06:53.077
I will show it
to you now.

06:53.145 --> 06:54.979
Oh, goody.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.783
(clears throat)

06:59.685 --> 07:01.319
That's it?

07:01.387 --> 07:03.821
You're just going
                to <i>grepse</i> at me?

07:05.224 --> 07:07.391
(banging, bells jingling)

07:26.778 --> 07:30.214
Uh... <i>iska bedesko,</i>
          <i>iska bedasko.</i>

07:32.618 --> 07:34.585
(sighs)

07:34.687 --> 07:37.321
(speaking native language)

07:47.599 --> 07:51.735
(yelling)

07:53.772 --> 07:56.974
<i>Bushky, bushky.</i>

07:57.042 --> 07:58.743
<i>Da.</i>

08:02.214 --> 08:03.514
Oh.

08:05.817 --> 08:08.452
Oh.

08:09.421 --> 08:11.422
<i>Yiskuk. Yiskuk.</i>

08:11.489 --> 08:13.424
<i>Yis... kuk!</i>

08:16.795 --> 08:19.763
Uh... Uh, Simka, I, uh...

08:19.831 --> 08:21.098
I-I really don't know
         your language,

08:21.166 --> 08:23.401
so, uh, I'm gonna have
   to do the rest in English.

08:23.435 --> 08:24.701
Is that all right?

08:24.769 --> 08:26.070
Oh, that's okay.

08:26.138 --> 08:28.205
You do it in any language
           you want.

08:28.273 --> 08:30.341
I'm just glad
      you're not a leper.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.683
There is our fine
                   young prince.

08:40.753 --> 08:41.818
You have to sing it.

08:41.885 --> 08:43.320
Sing it? I
                  can't sing it.

08:43.388 --> 08:45.489
You have to. You have
to do it beautiful,

08:45.557 --> 08:46.690
or else she won't accept.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.126
I can't sing.
You have to.

08:48.193 --> 08:49.593
I can't!
        Sing it.

08:53.766 --> 08:55.466
ALEX:
Oy...

08:55.533 --> 08:57.268
(whimpering)

09:00.772 --> 09:04.175
Â¶ There is a fine
                  young prince Â¶

09:04.243 --> 09:08.412
Â¶ He has mounted
Cossacks... Â¶

09:08.480 --> 09:11.081
I am going to die
a bachelor.

09:12.151 --> 09:14.752
Oh, Simka,
      Simka, listen to me.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.254
Latka is the... is...

09:16.321 --> 09:17.755
He's the hardest-working,
         most sincere,

09:17.822 --> 09:19.457
most loving man I've ever met.

09:19.525 --> 09:21.292
Have you ever noticed
how his face lights up

09:21.359 --> 09:22.794
just when you walk
in a room?

09:22.861 --> 09:26.063
If-If you
                    marry Latka,

09:26.131 --> 09:28.633
your lives will be very happy,
because you love each other,

09:28.700 --> 09:30.234
and you're both sweet,
wonderful people.

09:30.302 --> 09:32.937
And he'll be devoted to you
   for the rest of your life.

09:33.004 --> 09:34.138
Simka,

09:34.206 --> 09:35.373
I've never met
two people

09:35.440 --> 09:37.875
more suited to each other
than you and Latka.

09:37.942 --> 09:39.710
What do you say?

09:39.778 --> 09:41.145
What do you say?

09:54.359 --> 09:57.861
You... You have grabbed the nose
        of the <i>Gewirtzal</i>

09:57.929 --> 10:01.432
and made me
    the happiest man alive.

10:03.569 --> 10:05.570
And you?

10:05.637 --> 10:07.572
Of course.

10:16.448 --> 10:17.448
(knocking at door)

10:17.516 --> 10:18.883
Oh. Continue to wait.

10:18.950 --> 10:21.285
SIMKA:
                           Okay.

10:21.353 --> 10:23.488
Mama, you will give us
your blessing tonight,

10:23.555 --> 10:24.722
won't you?

10:24.790 --> 10:27.125
Latka, you
                    know better.

10:27.192 --> 10:29.260
It all depends on
                  how she reacts

10:29.327 --> 10:31.129
when I tell
                 her the <i>murzik.</i>

10:31.196 --> 10:32.630
You are still
                        waiting?

10:32.697 --> 10:33.998
SIMKA:
          You betcha.

10:34.065 --> 10:35.566
Ah.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.501
Latka, go now.

10:37.569 --> 10:40.104
You know, no man has ever
          been allowed

10:40.171 --> 10:42.506
to hear what I'm about
          to tell her.

10:45.611 --> 10:47.578
Hmm.

11:04.563 --> 11:06.229
Simka Dahblitz?

11:06.297 --> 11:09.032
Greta Gravas?

11:18.910 --> 11:23.347
So, you want
       to marry my Latka?

11:23.415 --> 11:25.383
Yes, Mrs. Gravas.

11:25.450 --> 11:28.151
Oh, I love him!

11:28.187 --> 11:29.453
Love. (laughs)

11:29.521 --> 11:31.522
Mrs. Gravas,

11:31.589 --> 11:34.892
I want so much
                 to marry Latka,

11:34.959 --> 11:36.794
and I want

11:36.862 --> 11:40.931
so much to hear the wisdom
         of my culture.

11:40.999 --> 11:44.101
Please, tell me the <i>murzik.</i>

11:44.203 --> 11:47.738
Listen carefully
    to me, my child.

11:47.806 --> 11:51.509
I will tell you the <i>murzik.</i>

11:54.179 --> 11:59.283
Men are nothing
but lazy lumps of drunken flesh.

12:03.255 --> 12:06.423
They crowd you in bed,
get you all worked up,

12:06.491 --> 12:08.793
and then before you can say,
"Is that all there is?"

12:08.860 --> 12:10.961
that's all there is.

12:14.666 --> 12:16.033
They pass out smokes

12:16.100 --> 12:19.703
when you are still whimpering
from pain of delivery.

12:19.771 --> 12:24.475
Your flaxen hair will
become like dead grass,

12:24.543 --> 12:27.644
and your once firm breasts

12:27.712 --> 12:29.713
will fall to the floor.

12:36.921 --> 12:38.989
Thank you.

12:41.794 --> 12:45.463
I will store that away.

12:45.530 --> 12:49.833
Do you still want to marry
         my son Latka?

12:50.769 --> 12:53.704
Almost more than ever.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.572
Very well.

12:55.641 --> 12:58.676
But before I can give you
          my blessing

12:58.743 --> 13:01.679
to marry my beloved son,

13:01.746 --> 13:04.749
you must first kiss
       your mother-in-law

13:04.816 --> 13:06.416
on the cheek.

13:06.484 --> 13:08.319
Okay.

13:17.629 --> 13:18.495
(grunts)

13:20.198 --> 13:21.965
(sighs)

13:25.871 --> 13:28.772
You cannot walk
on my son's furniture.

13:36.582 --> 13:39.050
(sighs)

13:39.117 --> 13:41.152
You won't bend?

13:43.155 --> 13:45.322
Mothers-in-law are forbidden

13:45.390 --> 13:47.424
by tradition to bend.

13:51.196 --> 13:52.196
(groans)

13:54.232 --> 13:57.134
(traditional music plays)

14:00.138 --> 14:02.373
This place certainly
            looks more cheerful.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.041
I hardly recognize it.

14:04.109 --> 14:05.175
Yeah, well I do.

14:05.243 --> 14:08.178
Be it ever so humble,
there's no place like hell.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.881
A sense of humor
                 can cushion you

14:10.949 --> 14:13.751
from the harsh realities
                        of life.

14:13.819 --> 14:16.720
It can also make you seem
             like a real bummer.

14:16.855 --> 14:18.755
Don't take me
                      seriously.

14:18.824 --> 14:20.358
I'm flirting
                       with you.

14:20.425 --> 14:21.525
Oh.

14:21.592 --> 14:23.394
Of course, I'm happily
                        married,

14:23.462 --> 14:26.897
but an innocent flirtation can
       be harmless and pleasant,

14:26.965 --> 14:29.766
and can reinforce our
              sexual identities.

14:33.271 --> 14:37.040
She's fun when she lets her
           hair down, isn't she?

14:37.075 --> 14:38.775
Hey, I can't believe it.

14:38.844 --> 14:40.044
After all the problems,

14:40.111 --> 14:41.879
Latka and Simka are finally
       gonna get married.

14:41.947 --> 14:43.881
What a great day this must be
         for them, huh?

14:43.949 --> 14:44.915
ALEX:
                           Yeah.
             Geez.

14:44.983 --> 14:46.183
(women crying)
             <i>Salud.</i>

14:49.554 --> 14:50.888
Oh, my gosh.

14:50.956 --> 14:52.890
Excuse me, can I ask you
          a question?
                      Certainly.

14:52.958 --> 14:55.059
Well, why are those women
          so unhappy?

14:55.127 --> 14:57.695
Oh, they are lamenting
              the bride's future

14:57.762 --> 15:00.363
as slave to her husband

15:00.431 --> 15:03.300
and the groom's burden of
           family responsibility

15:03.368 --> 15:05.368
which will eventually
                      crush him.

15:08.974 --> 15:11.074
You must be Latka's
               American friends.
Mm-hmm.

15:11.109 --> 15:12.809
Yes.
                I am Mascha from
                Latka's country.

15:12.878 --> 15:14.144
Hey, Masch, how are ya?

15:14.212 --> 15:15.746
Nice to meet ya.

15:15.813 --> 15:17.414
What about your accent?

15:17.482 --> 15:18.582
Oh, I live in London

15:18.650 --> 15:21.585
where I work as a
         weatherman for the BBC.

15:21.653 --> 15:24.521
I'll be translating
                   the ceremony.

15:24.589 --> 15:25.656
Do you have any
                      questions?

15:25.757 --> 15:26.924
Uh, I can't think of any.

15:27.025 --> 15:29.226
What about "What is the
              most unusual thing

15:29.294 --> 15:30.661
about our ceremony?"

15:30.728 --> 15:31.895
Well, that's a good one.

15:31.963 --> 15:33.864
The most unusual
                        thing is

15:33.932 --> 15:36.733
that it is rather a test
                than a ceremony.

15:36.802 --> 15:38.735
Um, if the bride
                  and groom fail

15:38.804 --> 15:40.905
to answer any of the
                  key questions,

15:40.972 --> 15:42.606
they can never
                     be married.

15:42.674 --> 15:44.541
ALEX:
Hmm.
                    Well, thanks
                     for asking.

15:46.545 --> 15:49.313
(man shouting)

15:49.381 --> 15:52.149
Aha, the priest is ready.

15:52.217 --> 15:55.152
Would everybody please
           be seated?

15:58.522 --> 16:01.726
Let the wedding of Latka
        and Simka begin.

16:03.695 --> 16:06.830
The Honorable H.L. Gorki
           presiding.

16:06.898 --> 16:09.633
(accordion plays
       traditional tune)

16:23.748 --> 16:25.983
And now the bride.

16:26.084 --> 16:27.784
Â¶

16:30.288 --> 16:33.757
Oh, she looks so beautiful
in her costume.

16:33.825 --> 16:35.759
You're not gonna cry.

16:35.827 --> 16:38.261
I don't think I can
                  help it, Alex.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.898
MASCHA:
             To truly understand
                    the feelings

16:40.965 --> 16:42.800
and emotions of
                     their mate,

16:42.867 --> 16:44.802
the bride and groom
                      must marry

16:44.870 --> 16:47.671
in each other's
                        clothes.

16:47.773 --> 16:50.407
And now the groom.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.476
Â¶

17:03.054 --> 17:05.856
You don't know how
              long I have waited

17:05.924 --> 17:08.858
to see you in your father's
                  wedding dress.

17:22.606 --> 17:25.075
The priest...

17:25.142 --> 17:28.145
will now place
                  a crown of rue

17:28.213 --> 17:30.648
on the bride's head.

17:30.715 --> 17:32.883
If she can walk
                      amongst us

17:32.984 --> 17:34.184
without it falling,

17:34.186 --> 17:36.152
she will be proven
                       a virgin,

17:36.254 --> 17:39.189
and the ceremony
                   may continue.

17:57.776 --> 18:00.710
My beloved family
         and friends...

18:00.779 --> 18:03.814
this was just a horrible
           accident.

18:03.881 --> 18:06.549
You must believe

18:06.617 --> 18:08.551
that never have I,

18:08.619 --> 18:12.055
this innocent, untried girl,

18:12.123 --> 18:14.557
ever been with a man.

18:14.625 --> 18:18.795
Never have I felt a man's warm,

18:18.863 --> 18:22.299
moist lips pressing

18:22.367 --> 18:25.802
against my waiting mouth.

18:25.870 --> 18:28.805
Nor have I felt the hot flesh

18:28.873 --> 18:31.808
of a lover...

18:31.876 --> 18:34.144
turning at night,

18:34.212 --> 18:39.049
his muscular arm resting
      against my stomach,

18:39.117 --> 18:41.485
my breath coming quick,

18:41.553 --> 18:45.189
senses heightened,

18:45.256 --> 18:47.157
the air humid...

18:47.292 --> 18:48.692
Simka!

18:48.793 --> 18:50.727
Simka!

18:53.999 --> 18:55.732
Oh.

18:55.767 --> 18:58.669
I'm finished.

18:58.736 --> 19:00.503
(priest speaking native
           language)

19:02.473 --> 19:04.174
(sneezing)

19:05.877 --> 19:08.979
The priest has given
                 his blessing...

19:09.848 --> 19:12.282
...and has signaled

19:12.350 --> 19:14.751
for the ritual of
             questions to begin.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.052
<i>Abee.</i>

19:16.188 --> 19:18.121
Question number one.

19:18.190 --> 19:21.124
(speaking native language)

19:21.193 --> 19:23.126
Who is it who is not
                 your brother...

19:23.195 --> 19:25.128
(speaking native language)

19:25.197 --> 19:27.531
...yet he is your
                   father's son?

19:28.533 --> 19:31.535
(speaking native language)

19:34.839 --> 19:36.006
(speaking native language)

19:36.074 --> 19:37.207
It is me.

19:37.274 --> 19:38.876
<i>Ibbida.</i>
                  That is right!

19:38.943 --> 19:41.211
(cheering and applause)

19:41.279 --> 19:42.379
(priest speaking native
           language)

19:42.447 --> 19:44.348
MASCHA:
                     Number two.

19:44.416 --> 19:46.116
(speaking native language)

19:46.184 --> 19:48.451
MASCHA:
   What is the greatest gift

19:48.520 --> 19:50.587
one person can give
                     to another?

19:50.655 --> 19:52.255
(speaking native language)

19:52.323 --> 19:55.124
She said $5,100.

19:55.193 --> 19:56.292
(all sighing)

19:56.328 --> 19:58.028
(speaking native language)

19:58.129 --> 19:59.329
<i>Ibbida.</i>

19:59.397 --> 20:02.032
MASCHA:
                  That is right.

20:02.099 --> 20:03.500
(cheering and applause)

20:07.172 --> 20:09.673
(speaking native language)

20:09.741 --> 20:11.675
You now have
                      two right.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.176
(speaking native language)

20:13.245 --> 20:14.645
Get this next
                    one right...

20:14.746 --> 20:15.879
(priest speaking native
           language)

20:15.947 --> 20:18.015
...and I can pronounce
               you man and wife.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.416
(speaking native language)

20:19.484 --> 20:22.852
And the joyful dance of
         the <i>plumitz</i> will begin.

20:24.889 --> 20:26.490
Latka!

20:26.557 --> 20:28.492
Latka!

20:38.636 --> 20:40.570
Latka!

20:47.144 --> 20:49.413
(speaking native language)

20:49.480 --> 20:51.615
There is a beautiful
                           baby.

20:51.682 --> 20:52.582
(priest speaking native
           language)

20:52.650 --> 20:53.950
MASCHA:
             And there is Simka.

20:54.018 --> 20:56.520
(speaking native language)

20:56.587 --> 20:57.987
(speaking native language)

20:58.056 --> 20:59.523
(speaking native language)

20:59.590 --> 21:02.526
A wild boar is
                       charging.

21:02.593 --> 21:05.195
(speaking native language)

21:05.263 --> 21:06.696
You can save only one.

21:06.764 --> 21:07.697
(speaking native language)

21:07.765 --> 21:08.965
Who do you save?

21:10.068 --> 21:11.801
(whispering)

21:11.869 --> 21:13.036
The kid.

21:13.104 --> 21:14.504
(overlapping chatter)
             LOUIE:
           Yourself!

21:14.572 --> 21:18.408
(clamoring)

21:18.476 --> 21:20.611
Latka?

21:20.712 --> 21:22.512
(clamoring stops)

21:22.580 --> 21:24.514
Uh...

21:24.582 --> 21:26.516
(speaking native language)

21:26.584 --> 21:27.850
...Simka.

21:27.919 --> 21:30.621
(speaking native language)

21:31.656 --> 21:34.992
(priest speaking native
           language)

21:39.063 --> 21:40.764
That was the wrong
                         answer.

21:40.832 --> 21:42.365
You have failed
                       the test.

21:42.433 --> 21:43.934
There will be
                     no wedding.

21:44.001 --> 21:45.936
<i>Grechnipa.</i>
                       Good-bye.

21:47.772 --> 21:49.272
(all moaning)

21:49.307 --> 21:52.509
Wait! I will not allow this!

21:54.479 --> 21:58.448
What do some ancient
      questions have to do

21:58.483 --> 22:01.284
with two people
      who love each other?

22:03.321 --> 22:06.123
Latka's my life.

22:07.591 --> 22:10.527
If you will not marry us,

22:10.594 --> 22:13.530
then we will marry
        someplace else.

22:14.732 --> 22:17.400
We must be together.

22:17.469 --> 22:19.202
(whispering)

22:21.873 --> 22:23.807
(speaking native language)

22:23.875 --> 22:27.010
That is exactly what the
          priest wanted to hear.

22:27.845 --> 22:29.613
(priest speaking native
           language)

22:29.681 --> 22:32.683
MASCHA:
                    That was the
                     final test.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.117
(speaking native language)

22:34.185 --> 22:35.618
One of them had
                     to stand up

22:35.686 --> 22:36.886
and demand to
                     be married.

22:41.492 --> 22:44.328
Latka, Simka...

22:47.699 --> 22:50.333
(speaking native language)

22:50.401 --> 22:52.435
May the stars shine
                       upon you.

22:52.470 --> 22:54.037
(priest speaking native
           language)

22:54.105 --> 22:56.039
And grant you
                  many children.

22:56.107 --> 22:57.708
(priest speaking native
           language)

22:57.776 --> 23:00.043
You are now husband
                       and wife.

23:00.111 --> 23:01.578
(all cheering)

23:01.679 --> 23:03.413
PRIEST:
                        <i>Plumitz!</i>

23:03.481 --> 23:06.116
<i>Plumitz, plumitz, plumitz!</i>

23:06.184 --> 23:07.917
(sprightly accordion tune plays)

23:11.689 --> 23:13.623
(rhythmic clapping)

23:27.539 --> 23:29.606
(theme song playing)

23:53.531 --> 23:54.765
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:54.832 --> 23:55.832
(man grumbling)

23:56.305 --> 24:02.804
