00:01.169 --> 00:03.036
GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.071 --> 00:05.139
-We're getting married.
-Did you know about this?

00:05.173 --> 00:08.208
He said he couldn't imagine
the rest of his life without me.
And then he gave me this.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.178
-Ante up.
-(mewing)

00:10.211 --> 00:13.047
You play for kittens?

00:13.080 --> 00:15.648
Have you spoken to Dawn about
that incident at Halloween?

00:15.682 --> 00:17.417
I thought you took care of that.

00:17.451 --> 00:20.153
-Right.
-What would I do without you?

00:20.187 --> 00:22.089
Willow, you're using
too much magic.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.658
What do you want me to do,
just sit back
and keep my mouth shut?

00:24.692 --> 00:25.992
Well, that'd be a good start.

00:26.025 --> 00:29.028
Shh, forget it
ever happened.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.033
Forget.

00:34.067 --> 00:36.503
But I think I was in heaven.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.439
I was torn out of there,

00:38.472 --> 00:40.807
pulled out by my friends.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.299
Can we talk?

01:06.334 --> 01:08.236
Vocal cord-wise? Yes.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.003
With each other? No.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.275
We have to talk.
(sighs)

01:14.307 --> 01:15.509
About what?

01:17.411 --> 01:19.146
We kissed, Buffy.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.281
So?

01:21.448 --> 01:23.551
We-- We kissed.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.120
You and me.
All Gone With the Wind,

01:26.153 --> 01:28.256
with the rising music
and the rising...

01:29.456 --> 01:30.924
music.
And was that, Buffy?

01:30.957 --> 01:34.328
A spell?
Oh, don't get all
prim and proper on me.

01:34.361 --> 01:36.996
I know what kind of girl
you really are.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.168
Don't I?

01:40.200 --> 01:42.069
What we did is done.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.139
But I will
never kiss you, Spike,
never touch you ever,

01:45.173 --> 01:47.207
ever again.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.110
(Buffy grunts)

01:53.213 --> 01:55.915
Now, easy, boys.

01:55.948 --> 01:59.686
No need
to get physical, eh?
(chuckling)

01:59.719 --> 02:01.921
Is there, Mr. Spike?

02:01.954 --> 02:03.956
You know
this guy?

02:03.990 --> 02:06.260
Yeah.
What do you want?

02:06.293 --> 02:11.764
Uh, me? Uh, there are
a lot of things
I would like, Mr. Spike.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.167
(grunts)

02:13.200 --> 02:18.171
A house in Bel Air
with a generously sized
swimming pool,

02:18.205 --> 02:22.876
and, of course,
the 40 Siamese
that you owe me.

02:22.909 --> 02:24.444
Take it easy.
You'll get your kittens.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.848
Oh, I trust you, Mr. Spike.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.783
Oh, God. What is it
with you guys?
Why kittens?

02:30.818 --> 02:33.820
-Why can't you just use money
like everybody else?
-(chuckles)

02:33.853 --> 02:36.490
She's funny.
I like funny in a girl.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.057
I just need
a little more time.

02:38.091 --> 02:43.796
Oh, time, time, time
is what turns kittens into cats.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.066
Look, I don't want to
see anyone get hurt.

02:46.098 --> 02:48.168
Boys.

02:53.039 --> 02:54.074
Then you'd better
close your eyes.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.844
(growls, groans)

03:00.381 --> 03:03.217
I said she was
the Slayer, boss.

03:03.251 --> 03:06.086
Ah, good for you.

03:06.118 --> 03:09.088
The Vampire Slayer.

03:09.122 --> 03:13.193
Have you ever given any thought
to, uh, freelance work?
Debt collecting, perhaps?

03:13.227 --> 03:16.663
(chuckling)
No, thank you.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.533
Boss, he's gone.
Spike has split.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.936
Ah, well, that's what
I get for socializing.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.504
All right, come on, boys.

03:24.538 --> 03:30.544
We'll locate Mr. Spike and,
uh, ta to him a little more.

03:30.578 --> 03:34.448
Oh, it was
a genuine pleasure.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.584
(growls, snarls)

03:38.050 --> 03:39.853
(sighs)

03:39.887 --> 03:44.258
If I would just stop
saving his life, it would
simple things up so much.

03:46.593 --> 03:48.628
(theme music playing)

04:43.115 --> 04:46.119
Do you think she
walked around on clouds...

04:46.153 --> 04:50.490
wearing, like, Birkenstocks
and played a harp?

04:50.524 --> 04:53.793
'Cause those are
just not flattering.

04:53.826 --> 04:57.798
You know, the clunky sandals,
not a harp.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.199
I mean, who doesn't
look good with a harp?

05:06.072 --> 05:08.875
What? I-I'm just saying
what everyone's thinking.

05:08.908 --> 05:11.043
Right, baby?

05:11.077 --> 05:14.648
You are attractive and
have many good qualities.

05:14.682 --> 05:15.983
It's totally not stupid

05:16.016 --> 05:18.185
to wonder what
it was like for Buffy.

05:18.218 --> 05:21.521
But it could have been
any one of a zillion
heavenly dimensions.

05:21.555 --> 05:26.192
All we know is that
it was a good place
and she was happy there.

05:26.225 --> 05:29.697
We took her away from that.
We wrecked it for her.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.199
We didn't wreck.
We didn't know.

05:32.231 --> 05:34.033
We didn't want to know.

05:35.569 --> 05:39.072
We were so selfish.
I was so selfish.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.377
Maybe we were.

05:44.411 --> 05:47.180
I just feel weird feeling bad
that my friend's not dead.

05:47.213 --> 05:49.417
It's too mind-boggling.

05:49.449 --> 05:52.252
So I've decided
to simplify the whole thing.

05:52.284 --> 05:54.353
Me like Buffy.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.689
Buffy's alive, so me glad.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.992
Not to be Miss Psycho Pep Squad,

05:59.026 --> 06:01.528
but we have got to stop
obsessing about what we did

06:01.562 --> 06:03.730
and start trying to
make things better
for Buffy.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.365
I'm with
Miss Psycho Pep Squad.

06:06.399 --> 06:07.867
We need to spend
more time with her,

06:07.901 --> 06:09.403
you know, just hang out.

06:09.437 --> 06:12.740
Maybe have
weekly dinners over here,

06:12.773 --> 06:16.444
or a book club--
short books-- videos.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.911
I can fix it.
I know a spell.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.281
No. No more spells.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.384
Then what?
This isn't something

06:24.418 --> 06:26.786
that's gonna be fixed
by a video club.

06:26.819 --> 06:30.790
I know I messed up, okay,
and I wanna fix it.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.427
I can't believe that we are
talking about this again.

06:33.461 --> 06:36.096
You know how powerful magic is,
how dangerous.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.865
You could hurt someone.
You could hurt yourself.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.802
But I know a spell
that will make her forget
she was ever in heaven.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.605
God, what is wrong
with you?

06:44.637 --> 06:47.908
I'm gonna go get that phone.
You probably don't hear it.

06:47.941 --> 06:51.244
High-pitched ring.
Ears like a dog.
I'm gonna help you with that.

06:53.613 --> 06:56.283
Do you think
I'm stupid?

06:56.316 --> 06:58.151
I know you used
that spell on me.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.954
Tara, I'm sorry, I--

07:00.987 --> 07:03.923
Don't. Just... don't.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.793
There's nothing you can say.

07:06.826 --> 07:10.096
Tara, I didn't mean to--
To what?

07:10.129 --> 07:12.264
Violate my mind like that?

07:14.201 --> 07:15.334
How could you, Willow?

07:17.103 --> 07:20.240
How could you
after what Glory did to me?

07:20.273 --> 07:22.810
Violate you? I--

07:22.843 --> 07:25.312
I didn't mean
anything like that.

07:25.345 --> 07:29.348
I-I just wanted us
not to fight anymore.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.519
I love you.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.521
If you don't want to fight,
you don't fight.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.290
You don't use magic
to make a fight disappear.

07:37.324 --> 07:41.661
But I-- I just wanted
to make things better--
better for us.

07:41.694 --> 07:44.665
But y don't get to decide
what is better for us, Wil.

07:44.697 --> 07:48.168
We're in a relationship.
We are supposed to
decide together.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.202
Okay.

07:50.237 --> 07:53.273
I realize that I--
I did it wrong.

07:53.305 --> 07:55.475
You did it the way
you're doing everything.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.343
When things get rough,
you--

07:58.911 --> 08:00.947
(sighs)
You don't even consider
the options.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.315
You just--
You just do a spell.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.319
It's not good for you,
Willow.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.223
And it's not
what magic is for.

08:10.257 --> 08:13.894
But I--
I just wanna help people.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.730
Maybe that's how it started,
but...

08:16.764 --> 08:19.600
you're helping yourself now,
fixing things to your liking.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.401
Including me.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.370
Tara, no.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.346
I don't think
this is gonna work.

08:35.582 --> 08:36.616
Hey.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.888
It is.
It-- It's working.

08:44.290 --> 08:47.827
Tara, please.
I-- I need you, baby.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.897
I-- I need you.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.530
I-I don't need magic.

08:51.565 --> 08:55.201
I-I don't. I--
Let me prove it to you.
Okay?

08:55.235 --> 08:57.203
I-I will go a month

08:57.236 --> 08:59.038
without doing any magic.

08:59.072 --> 09:02.142
I-I won't do
a single spell.
I swear.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.615
Go a week.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.583
One week without magic.

09:10.618 --> 09:13.485
Fine. Fine.
That's easy.

09:16.088 --> 09:17.890
Go a week,
and then we'll see.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.461
I don't know, I just--

09:22.995 --> 09:25.899
I think we both need some,
I don't know, space.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.370
(sighs)
I can't believe
I'm saying this.

09:31.403 --> 09:34.106
Are you saying
you're gonna leave me?

09:35.408 --> 09:36.509
I have to.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.347
Uh-huh.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.220
GILES:
You have to be strong.

09:47.254 --> 09:52.158
-I-I'm trying to--
-Trying to-- to what? Desert me?

09:52.192 --> 09:56.328
Abandon me?
Leave me all alone
when I really need somebody?

09:59.165 --> 10:00.332
I don't want to leave.

10:00.366 --> 10:01.368
So don't.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.705
Please don't.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.841
I can't do this
without you.

10:07.875 --> 10:11.077
You can.
That's why I'm going.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.346
As long as I stay,
you will always
turn to me

10:13.379 --> 10:16.115
if something comes up
that you feel
you can't handle,

10:16.149 --> 10:18.284
and I'll step in,
because--

10:18.317 --> 10:20.352
(sighs)

10:20.386 --> 10:22.789
because I can't bear
to see you suffer.

10:23.856 --> 10:26.625
Me too.
Hate suffering.

10:26.659 --> 10:28.528
Had about as much of it
as I can take.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.163
Believe me,

10:30.263 --> 10:32.631
I'm loathe
to cause you more,
but this--

10:35.235 --> 10:37.705
I've taught you all I can
about being the Slayer,

10:37.738 --> 10:40.206
and your mother
taught you what you needed
to know about life.

10:41.207 --> 10:42.209
You...

10:44.076 --> 10:47.246
You're not gonna trust that
until you're forced
to stand alone.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.149
But why now?

10:50.182 --> 10:53.019
Now that you know
where I've been,
what I'm going through?

10:53.052 --> 10:55.989
Now more than ever.

10:56.023 --> 10:59.125
The temptation to give up
is going to be overwhelming,
and I can't let--

10:59.158 --> 11:02.730
So I won't.
No giving up.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.398
You can be here,
and I can still be strong.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.470
Buffy,
I've thought this over

11:10.503 --> 11:12.004
and over.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.876
I believe it's
the right thing to do.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.248
You're wrong.

11:25.217 --> 11:27.254
(door opens, closes)

11:31.457 --> 11:34.094
Willow, come on.
You ready?

11:34.126 --> 11:36.062
Not so much.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.899
You go ahead.
Tell Giles to hold up.
I'll be there in a sec.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.100
Fine.

11:41.134 --> 11:45.038
Hurry up.
You don't wanna miss the lowdown
on our latest featured creature.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.211
(magical hum)

12:10.263 --> 12:13.633
For Buffy and Tara
this I char.

12:13.666 --> 12:17.971
Let Lethe's Bramble
do its chore.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.572
Purge their minds
of memories grim,

12:20.606 --> 12:24.977
of pains from recent
slights and sins.

12:25.011 --> 12:28.380
When the fire goes out,
when the crystal turns black,

12:28.414 --> 12:30.250
the spell will be cast.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.753
Tabula rasa.
Tabula rasa.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.822
Tabula rasa.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.163
DAWN: So, what do we got?
GILES: Sorry?

12:45.131 --> 12:47.167
What kind of
ooglie-booglies?

12:47.200 --> 12:51.303
Lizardy types, or zombies,
or vampires, or what?

12:52.371 --> 12:54.540
There are no
ooglie-booglies, Dawn.

12:56.209 --> 12:59.778
Thanks for the jacket.
It's cold out there.

12:59.812 --> 13:02.381
Not a problem.
The cold only makes me
stronger and more macho-like.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.519
I'm glad you're here.
Um--

13:09.621 --> 13:11.758
I have something
I really have to tell you all.

13:11.791 --> 13:15.461
Um, I know it feels like we've
been through this before.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.999
Why don't you
just jump to the chase.
Tell them that you're--

13:19.032 --> 13:20.533
(sizzling)

13:22.701 --> 13:24.871
-Spike?
-Holy Moly!

13:24.904 --> 13:27.706
-You need to give me asylum.
-I'll say.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.943
No need to get cute.
It's a disguise.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.679
Happens there's a bloke
I'd rather not see just now.

13:36.415 --> 13:39.385
You met him, I believe.
Toothy bloke
with the baby seal breath.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.788
Nasty fellow, him,
and ugly too.

13:41.821 --> 13:45.158
He's got a mouthful of choppers
just waiting to be yanked out
and worn as necklaces.

13:53.900 --> 13:59.139
Well, now we've recovered
from Spike's sartorial humor,

13:59.172 --> 14:01.942
I'll jump...
to the chase.

14:03.275 --> 14:05.378
Um,

14:05.412 --> 14:07.379
I'm headed
back to England,

14:07.413 --> 14:09.448
and I plan to stay...

14:10.716 --> 14:13.552
indefinitely.
XANDER: Now?

14:13.586 --> 14:17.157
Not now. I mean,
not after... everything.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.758
Yes, now.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.692
For real this time?

14:20.726 --> 14:24.230
'Cause, honest to Pete,
a young shopkeeper's heart
can only take so much.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.433
-Not that I want you to go.
-I can't do this. I just--

14:27.466 --> 14:30.870
-I-I need to--
-Buffy. Listen.

14:32.772 --> 14:37.710
I know this must be
awful for you,
and I'm sorry.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.446
I-- I'm so sorry
for what we--

14:39.479 --> 14:41.780
"I'm sorry."
Everybody's sorry.

14:43.917 --> 14:47.720
I know that you guys
are just trying to help,
but it's just-- it's too much.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.289
And-- And I--
I can't take it
anymore.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.393
If you guys--

14:54.760 --> 14:57.264
If you guys
understood how it felt--

14:57.297 --> 14:58.597
how it feels--

15:00.000 --> 15:01.934
it's like I'm dying in--

15:46.778 --> 15:47.813
Huh?

15:58.125 --> 15:59.892
(gasps)
(gasps)

16:02.162 --> 16:05.631
-Hey.
-Hey?

16:17.677 --> 16:20.379
-Hello?
-(Spike groans)

16:20.413 --> 16:22.649
-Aaah!
-(screams)

16:28.254 --> 16:29.889
Who--

16:29.922 --> 16:32.292
Who are you people?
(gasps)

16:32.325 --> 16:36.028
-Don't worry.
-Please don't hurt me.

16:36.062 --> 16:38.898
Oh, it's okay.
I don't know anyone here either.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.534
Yeah? Who are you?

16:43.536 --> 16:45.837
I, uh--

16:47.874 --> 16:50.309
Okay, who are you freaks?

16:50.342 --> 16:52.044
You don't know me?

16:52.078 --> 16:55.648
Not a clue.
But you were just all,
like, "Oh, hey."

16:55.682 --> 16:58.085
Yeah, 'cause I thought
you were a girl
and I'd remember, but--

16:58.118 --> 17:04.490
Well, I am a girl.
I'm not sure who I am
exactly, but--

17:04.522 --> 17:07.394
Why was I on the ground?
And why are you all
staring at me?

17:07.425 --> 17:11.364
-Is this some psych test?
Am I getting paid for this?
-It's not just you.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.933
Does anyone
remember anything?

17:16.603 --> 17:18.605
Nope.

17:18.637 --> 17:22.709
Maybe we all got
terribly drunk, and this is
some sort of blackout.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.678
I don't think I drink.

17:25.711 --> 17:30.317
I don't see any booze.
I don't feel any head bumps.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.552
-I don't see Allen Funt.
-Who?

17:33.586 --> 17:36.955
Okay, I'm not panicking.
I'm not. I'm not.

17:36.989 --> 17:40.227
-Stop looking at me
like I'm panicking.
-BUFFY: Take it easy, guy.

17:40.259 --> 17:42.194
Okay, no one's hurt.
Right?

17:42.229 --> 17:44.931
And none of us look
all hatchety-murdery,

17:44.963 --> 17:47.799
so we're probably
safe here.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.970
Wherever here is.

17:51.002 --> 17:52.971
Look at the stuff
on these shelves.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.276
Weird jars
of weird stuff.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.912
Weird books
with weird covers.

17:59.945 --> 18:03.048
Like Magic for Beginners--
Oh!

18:03.082 --> 18:06.252
This is a magic shop.
A real magic shop.

18:06.286 --> 18:09.422
Maybe that's it.
Maybe something magic happened.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.458
Magic?
(snickers)

18:11.490 --> 18:14.260
Magic's all balderdash
and chicanery.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.163
I'm afraid we don't know
a bloody thing.

18:17.529 --> 18:21.800
Except I seem to be
British, don't I?
And a man.

18:21.834 --> 18:25.238
With glasses.
Well, that narrows it down
considerably.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.407
I don't like this.
It's okay.
Don't worry.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.277
We'll take care
of each other.

18:30.309 --> 18:33.279
We'll get our memory back,
and it'll all be
right as rain.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.448
SPIKE:
Oh, listen
to Mary Poppins.

18:35.481 --> 18:38.484
He's got his crust
all stiff and upper
with that nancy-boy accent.

18:38.518 --> 18:41.453
You Englishmen
are always so--

18:42.989 --> 18:44.156
Bloody hell.

18:44.191 --> 18:47.493
Sodding. Blimey.
Shagging. Knickers. Bollocks.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.362
Oh, God.
I'm English.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.530
Welcome to
the nancy tribe.

18:51.564 --> 18:55.801
You don't suppose you and I--
We're not related, are we?

18:55.835 --> 18:57.970
There is a ruggedly
handsome resemblance.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.541
And you do inspire a--

19:02.575 --> 19:07.046
well, a particular
feeling of familiarity

19:07.078 --> 19:09.215
and... disappointment.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.553
-Older brother?
-Father.

19:13.586 --> 19:17.022
Oh, God,
how I must hate you.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.826
-What did I do?
-There's always something.
And what's with the trollop?

19:19.858 --> 19:21.794
Hey.
Her?

19:21.827 --> 19:24.830
-I saw you sleeping together.
-Resting together.

19:24.864 --> 19:28.067
ANYA:
Look! It's okay.

19:28.099 --> 19:30.903
We're engaged.
Oh.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.971
It's a lovely ring.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.508
Oh, great. A tarty stepmom
who's half old Daddy's age.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.175
Tarty?
Old? You little twerp.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.378
I'm young enough
to still get carded.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.748
Carded!
Driver's licenses!

19:47.052 --> 19:50.423
It's me.
Alexander Harris.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.759
Cute picture.
Hey, I exist.

19:52.791 --> 19:55.761
I'm Willow Rosenberg.
(chuckles) Willow.

19:55.795 --> 19:58.330
-Funny name.
-I think it's pretty.

19:58.365 --> 20:01.099
-What do you got?
-Tara.

20:01.133 --> 20:04.103
-And look, I'm a student
at UC Sunnydale.
-Me too.

20:04.135 --> 20:06.772
Hey, maybe we're study buddies.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.040
I don't have a wallet.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.510
Don't worry.
Me neither.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.180
But here, look.

20:14.212 --> 20:16.516
You're Dawn.
(giggles)

20:16.548 --> 20:18.183
Or "Umad."

20:18.217 --> 20:21.053
I'm, uh, called
Rupert Giles.

20:21.086 --> 20:22.788
Rupert.
(giggling)

20:22.821 --> 20:25.857
Rupert?
(giggling)

20:25.892 --> 20:29.729
You're not too old to put
across my knee, you know, sonny.

20:29.761 --> 20:31.763
Anyway,
what did I call you?

20:31.798 --> 20:33.766
Um--

20:37.103 --> 20:39.105
"Made with care
for Randy."

20:41.007 --> 20:42.974
Randy Giles?

20:43.009 --> 20:47.413
Why not just call me
Horny Giles,
or Desperate-For-A-Shag Giles?

20:47.447 --> 20:49.382
I knew there was a reason
I hated you.

20:49.415 --> 20:52.585
Randy's a family name,
undoubtedly.

20:52.618 --> 20:56.556
Oh, hey, I have a name
on my jacket.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.590
"Harris."
XANDER: Harris?

20:58.625 --> 21:01.928
That's my last name.
Maybe I have a brother,
and you go out with him.

21:03.194 --> 21:05.131
Or maybe
you go out with me.

21:05.163 --> 21:08.835
Well, we did wake up
all snuggly-wuggly.

21:08.867 --> 21:11.471
Maybe you're my boyfriend.

21:11.503 --> 21:14.073
Either that, or I got
one pissed-off brother
out there somewhere.

21:14.105 --> 21:15.442
AYNA:
I'm "Ay-nya"!

21:15.474 --> 21:18.243
Um, this key fits this lock,

21:18.277 --> 21:21.247
and the forms
next to the cash register...

21:21.279 --> 21:23.982
say that Rupert and Anya
own the shop together.

21:24.016 --> 21:27.118
This is our magic shop?

21:27.153 --> 21:30.623
Well, that's-- that's very,
um, uh, progressive of me.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.991
So, you don't
have a name?

21:33.025 --> 21:37.262
Of course I do.
I just don't happen to know it.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.030
You want me to name you?

21:39.065 --> 21:41.901
Oh, that's sweet,
but I think I can name myself.

21:43.502 --> 21:46.373
I'll name me... Joan.

21:46.405 --> 21:47.574
Ugh.

21:48.540 --> 21:51.877
What? Did you
just "ugh" my name?

21:51.911 --> 21:54.313
No, I just--

21:54.346 --> 21:57.517
I mean, it's so blah.
Joan?

21:57.549 --> 21:58.718
I like it.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.953
I feel like a Joan.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.790
(chuckles)
Fine. That's your
"purgative."

22:04.824 --> 22:07.359
Prerogative.
Whatever, Joan.

22:07.394 --> 22:09.496
Whatever, Umad.

22:09.528 --> 22:11.196
Boy, you're bossy--
Boy, you're a pain in the--

22:12.565 --> 22:15.634
Do you think we're--
Sisters?

22:15.667 --> 22:18.269
(giggles)
You never showed me affection
like that...

22:19.838 --> 22:20.839
I'd wager.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.075
We need to figure out
what's going on.

22:23.108 --> 22:24.242
We need to get help.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.077
Looks like Joan
fancies herself the boss.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.747
We have a kid here--

22:27.779 --> 22:30.048
A teenager.
A teenager.

22:30.082 --> 22:32.984
And we have no idea
what's wrong with us.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.822
-I think a hospital's
our best bet.
-Uh, yes. Let's--

22:35.855 --> 22:38.490
Let's head out.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.992
BUFFY:
Any suggestions on how
we're gonna get there?

22:41.027 --> 22:42.494
Dad can drive.

22:42.528 --> 22:45.197
He's bound to have
some classic
midlife crisis transport.

22:45.230 --> 22:47.599
Something red, shiny,
shaped like a penis.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.837
-(snarling)
-(screaming)

22:51.871 --> 22:55.575
-Oh, my God!
Did you guys see that?
-Vampires!

22:55.607 --> 22:57.777
-Maybe it's Halloween.
-It doesn't feel like Halloween.

22:57.809 --> 23:01.614
Even if it is, those guys
are not kids, and those
are definitely not costumes.

23:01.647 --> 23:04.215
Randy's right.
Looks like we have vampires.
(banging on door)

23:04.250 --> 23:06.952
-VAMPIRE: Slayer!
-And they're definitely
not knocking for candy.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.755
Okay, doors.
We need to check to see

23:08.788 --> 23:10.522
if there's other doors,
make sure they're locked,

23:10.557 --> 23:12.825
and then put large objects
in front of them. Come on.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.295
Monsters are real?
Did we know this?

23:16.327 --> 23:18.464
I don't know, but we need
our memories back.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.066
We have to get to
a hospital.

23:20.098 --> 23:23.301
As, uh, proprietor
of a magic shop,
I propose we fight them.

23:23.335 --> 23:26.939
We can use things
here in the shop--
magic tricks or whatever.

23:26.972 --> 23:29.442
-(banging continues)
-Send out Spike!

23:31.109 --> 23:32.912
They seem to want spikes.

23:32.944 --> 23:34.614
Oh!

23:35.847 --> 23:38.017
-(Dawn whimpers)
-(banging continues)

23:39.451 --> 23:40.720
Here. Let's give 'em these.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.153
GILES:
Oh, well done.

23:43.789 --> 23:45.892
But wait, what are they
going to do with them?

23:45.924 --> 23:49.295
VAMPIRE: Slayer,
come out and play!
TARA: "Slay her."

23:49.327 --> 23:51.931
That's just what
they said before.

23:51.963 --> 23:54.567
TARA: Th-They're gonna use
the spikes to--
To slay someone?

23:54.601 --> 23:56.402
BUFFY:
A female someone.

23:56.434 --> 23:58.605
Who do those jerks
think they are?
ANYA: Bloodsuckers.

23:58.637 --> 24:01.406
They kill by sucking blood.
Take it easy, Joan.

24:01.440 --> 24:05.076
-WILLOW: You guys!
-There's a trap door
in the basement.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.445
-It seems to lead to the sewer.
-Let's go.

24:09.147 --> 24:11.250
(snarling)

24:11.282 --> 24:13.553
(all screaming)

24:17.388 --> 24:20.492
Hey, I'm not sure what I am,
so bear with me here.

24:20.527 --> 24:23.194
Now I lay me down to sleep--
(praying in Hebrew)
(Buffy screaming)

24:23.229 --> 24:24.864
Omm. Omm--

24:27.799 --> 24:31.671
-You owe us!
-Fine. Take your damn spikes.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.540
Don't be stupid!

24:34.574 --> 24:36.474
Get your hands
off me, you son of a--

24:36.509 --> 24:38.009
VAMPIRE:
I said, you owe us.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.346
Who, me?
You've got
the boss's kittens.

24:40.378 --> 24:42.048
-Kittens?
-(grunting, shouting)

24:43.182 --> 24:44.817
(blows landing)

24:46.251 --> 24:48.354
-Bitch.
-Hey! Stay away from Randy!

24:48.386 --> 24:50.522
(screaming)

24:51.824 --> 24:54.661
-Whoa!
-What did you just do?

24:55.827 --> 24:57.663
-Uh, I--
-(snarls)

24:59.865 --> 25:01.166
I don't know,

25:02.835 --> 25:04.202
but it was cool.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.740
The boss ain't gonna like this.
I'll be back.

25:07.773 --> 25:09.208
And I won't be
alone!

25:13.846 --> 25:16.915
I think I know why
Joan's the boss.

25:16.949 --> 25:19.184
I'm like a superhero
or something.

25:22.721 --> 25:25.657
The boys wanna taste blood,
boss.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.594
They wanna
break down the door.

25:27.626 --> 25:29.895
The boys are barbarians.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.998
There's no need to do that.

25:32.030 --> 25:34.733
The humans will turn on him
soon enough.

25:34.767 --> 25:37.769
And if they don't,
we'll burn the place
to the ground.

25:37.804 --> 25:40.673
-Okay, I've got a plan.
-I'm all ears.

25:40.707 --> 25:43.275
They seem to want Randy,
and I seem to be
pretty strong.

25:43.308 --> 25:44.876
Wicked strong.

25:44.911 --> 25:47.278
So you guys
go through the sewers
to get to the hospital.

25:47.378 --> 25:49.214
Randy and I'll give the monsters
a run for their money.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.617
-That's your plan?
-Yes.

25:51.651 --> 25:54.185
-Right.
-I'm not leaving the shop.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.423
I have to
protect the cash register
and... do some spells.

25:57.455 --> 26:00.692
Well, magic might help.
It's worth a shot.

26:00.727 --> 26:03.863
All right,
you work on that then.
We need to go.

26:03.895 --> 26:06.265
-Ready, Randy?
-Ready, Joan.

26:06.298 --> 26:07.499
Um, s-s-son?

26:08.601 --> 26:10.869
Come here, um, please.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.439
-Oh, uh, uh--
-Yes, um--

26:13.471 --> 26:15.807
Yes, well--

26:15.842 --> 26:17.743
Right.
Good, then.

26:19.010 --> 26:20.980
(vampires muttering)

26:21.012 --> 26:24.115
-(grunting)
-Get 'em!

26:32.324 --> 26:35.326
-Randy!
-Hey! I'm a superhero too!

26:38.865 --> 26:40.967
-(screaming)
-Joan, where are you going?

26:49.474 --> 26:51.442
-(snarling)
-(grunting)

27:01.019 --> 27:02.721
Hey! Joan!

27:03.722 --> 27:05.090
Wait up!

27:05.124 --> 27:06.992
Almost there.
Come on.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.294
Here we go.

27:10.229 --> 27:13.632
There you go.
(giggles)
Thanks.

27:25.744 --> 27:29.715
* The ants go marching
one by one,
Hurrah, hurrah *

27:29.749 --> 27:31.650
-* The ants
go marching one by-- *
-(snarling)

27:31.683 --> 27:35.221
(gasps, screaming)

27:39.090 --> 27:40.692
This must be nice
for us.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.363
Hmm? Sorry?

27:44.395 --> 27:48.701
I mean,
I know there's
the vampire problem,

27:48.734 --> 27:50.869
and our memory loss
and all that,

27:50.903 --> 27:52.671
but still,

27:52.704 --> 27:54.807
to spend this time
together, alone,

27:54.840 --> 27:56.174
must be nice.

27:58.176 --> 28:01.079
Uh, yes, yes, um, uh...
I'm sure that's right.

28:01.113 --> 28:03.883
Um, which, uh, which book
shall we start with?

28:07.618 --> 28:09.888
This is the book
for us.
Oh, good.

28:09.922 --> 28:13.224
Does it focus on mind control
or-or memory loss?

28:13.259 --> 28:14.559
Not exactly.

28:14.593 --> 28:18.529
I just, um--
My intuition tells me
this is the book.

28:18.564 --> 28:21.700
And I figure,
being a magic shop owner and
a natural at the supernatural,

28:21.733 --> 28:24.002
I should trust
my intuition.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.505
That's fine,
but as you recall,

28:26.538 --> 28:28.941
I, too, am
a magic shop owner.

28:28.974 --> 28:33.211
True, but my intuition
says you're not so much
the magic guy...

28:33.244 --> 28:35.748
and more
of a paperwork type.

28:35.781 --> 28:39.018
Okay, here we go.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.788
Wh-- You don't even know--
Bara-bara,
himble jemination.

28:41.820 --> 28:43.890
(screams)

28:43.923 --> 28:46.458
Wait up!

28:50.797 --> 28:53.398
Oh, bloody hell!
What are you doing?

28:53.432 --> 28:55.534
You don't know who you are.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.536
Right. None of us do.

28:57.568 --> 28:59.771
-And we're being chased by--
-You're a vampire.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.340
How can you say--

29:03.776 --> 29:05.277
I? Me, a vampire? No.

29:05.310 --> 29:07.278
Check the lumpies
and the teeth.

29:16.188 --> 29:17.789
I kill your kind.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.125
And I bite yours.

29:21.359 --> 29:22.994
So, how come
I don't want to bite you?

29:24.329 --> 29:26.164
And why am I
fighting other vampires?

29:30.936 --> 29:32.438
I must be a noble vampire.

29:33.704 --> 29:36.174
A good guy
on a mission of redemption.

29:37.343 --> 29:39.144
I help the helpless.

29:39.177 --> 29:42.949
-I'm a vampire with a soul.
-A vampire with a soul?

29:43.950 --> 29:46.152
Oh, my God.
How lame is that?

29:46.184 --> 29:49.087
Perhaps we should try
another book.
ANYA: No.

29:49.121 --> 29:52.858
This book
made the little fluffers.
This book's gonna send 'em back.

29:52.892 --> 29:55.126
I've got it this time.
Okay?

29:55.161 --> 29:57.864
Himbala bree,
 a bree voyant.

29:59.730 --> 30:00.833
Yes, dear.

30:02.233 --> 30:04.135
I'm a hero, really.

30:04.170 --> 30:07.272
I mean, to be cast
such an ugly lot in life
and then to rise above it,

30:07.306 --> 30:10.608
to seek out better,
nobler things--
it's inspirational, innit?

30:10.642 --> 30:13.378
And the two of us--
natural enemies
thrown together

30:13.412 --> 30:15.480
to stand against
the forces of darkness.

30:15.513 --> 30:19.617
A lot of trust.
No thought of me biting you.
No thought of you staking me.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.287
Depends on how long
you keep on yapping.

30:21.319 --> 30:23.422
(snarling)

30:33.332 --> 30:35.201
(snarls)

30:37.836 --> 30:40.605
Come on. This way.
Up the ladder.

30:53.719 --> 30:57.522
-(snarling continues)
-He's coming.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.509
Clearly, that is not
a helpful book, darling.

31:18.544 --> 31:21.846
Come down, and we will
go about fixing this
in a sensible fashion.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.182
Sensible?
You think it's sensible

31:23.214 --> 31:25.616
for me to go down into that
pit of cotton-top hell

31:25.651 --> 31:27.786
and let them hippity-hop
all over my vulnerable flesh?

31:27.818 --> 31:30.521
Fine. Then just stay up there
and keep making bunnies.

31:30.556 --> 31:31.890
It's a capital plan.

31:31.923 --> 31:34.526
What capital? I never know
what you're talking about.

31:34.559 --> 31:37.063
Loo? Shag? Brolly?
What the hell
is all that?

31:37.096 --> 31:39.397
What? There's no way
you could remember me
saying any of those words.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.833
Ah, bugger off,
you brolly.

31:51.978 --> 31:54.012
Note to self:
learn to duck.

32:07.358 --> 32:09.194
(growling, yelling)

32:23.442 --> 32:25.510
Get a different book!

32:25.544 --> 32:28.680
(grunting)
Put that book down!
Do you hear?

32:28.713 --> 32:30.682
Not that book!

32:37.288 --> 32:39.290
How you doing, Dawn?

32:39.325 --> 32:42.028
Uh, I'm okay.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.362
It's scary...

32:44.329 --> 32:47.965
but weirdly
kind of familiar.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.036
I know what you mean.

32:52.371 --> 32:53.372
How are you?

32:55.207 --> 32:57.276
A little confused.

32:57.308 --> 33:01.380
I mean, I'm, uh,
all sweaty and trapped,

33:01.413 --> 33:02.948
no memory,

33:02.980 --> 33:05.817
hiding in a pipe
from a vampire.

33:07.885 --> 33:09.887
And I think I'm kinda gay.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.492
(creature roaring)

33:14.526 --> 33:17.628
(whispering)
Look what you've done,
you lunatic woman.

33:17.663 --> 33:20.231
(whispering) Don't blame me,
you snobby, snotty,

33:20.266 --> 33:22.401
thinks-he's-so-great
kinda jerk.

33:22.433 --> 33:25.203
And I feel compelled
to take some vengeance
on you.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.306
Oww!

33:27.338 --> 33:29.840
God, no wonder
I'm leaving you!

33:29.875 --> 33:32.144
What?

33:32.177 --> 33:36.082
Look.
A one-way ticket to London
and out of this engagement.

33:37.115 --> 33:39.218
(roaring continues)

33:40.086 --> 33:41.886
Of all the nerve.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.824
(jingling)

33:45.856 --> 33:47.659
(roaring continues)

33:47.692 --> 33:51.529
Now look at what you've done.
That thing is gonna
eat my ring.

33:56.567 --> 33:59.438
I smell fear,
and it smells good.

34:12.318 --> 34:14.619
(both grunting)

34:23.829 --> 34:26.764
Vartas... fenga...

34:26.797 --> 34:29.635
montah... warray.

34:29.668 --> 34:31.469
(thunderclap)

34:41.813 --> 34:43.215
Oh.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.750
Well, that's better.

34:50.489 --> 34:53.224
(sighs)
Thank goodness.

34:53.259 --> 34:55.092
I'm so sorry, dear.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.963
No, Rupy, I'm sorry.

34:58.996 --> 35:00.666
You were right.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.802
That was the wrong book.

35:03.835 --> 35:05.971
Oh, um--

35:06.972 --> 35:09.775
Uh, y-yes, it was.

35:09.807 --> 35:11.777
But I'm still sorry.

35:11.809 --> 35:13.144
Don't leave me.

35:15.646 --> 35:16.782
Oh, Anya.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.927
-(growls)
-(screams)

35:29.960 --> 35:34.300
XANDER:
Over here, big guy. Check out
this throbbing jugular.

35:48.646 --> 35:50.581
Alex!

35:51.916 --> 35:54.253
(groans, roars)

36:33.023 --> 36:34.793
Don't mess with Joan of--

36:45.971 --> 36:48.039
(snarling)
(groaning)

36:49.740 --> 36:51.376
Buffy! Buff--

37:16.467 --> 37:19.804
(laughing)

37:19.838 --> 37:22.907
Sorry. I just got back
the memory of seeing
 King Ralph.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.679
We should get back.

37:54.806 --> 37:57.074
Well, this place certainly
needs a good tidying.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.677
Oh, yes. Yes.

37:59.710 --> 38:00.846
Yes.

38:02.112 --> 38:04.014
(Spike snarling, grunting)
(blows landing)

38:06.150 --> 38:07.952
From dust...

38:07.985 --> 38:09.655
(screams)
to dust.

38:11.690 --> 38:15.260
You're an odd duck,
Mr. Spike.

38:15.293 --> 38:19.264
Fighting your own kind,
palling around with a Slayer.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.367
And, oh, that suit!

38:21.400 --> 38:24.969
Chutzpah must be
your middle name.

38:25.003 --> 38:29.440
Uh, hey, look, uh,
about our little debt problem,
it's okay.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.476
I don't need the kittens.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.614
You'll get paid.
I'm no welcher.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.682
(chuckling)
Right. Sure.

38:37.715 --> 38:40.150
You're good for it.
I know that.
(laughing)

38:40.184 --> 38:43.822
I'm just going to, uh--
Yeah. (clears throat)

38:45.690 --> 38:47.693
(sighs)

38:47.726 --> 38:50.161
(panting)

38:53.364 --> 38:54.833
You all right?

39:06.378 --> 39:08.278
(sighs)

39:11.617 --> 39:15.420
* A lot of things
I believed in *

39:18.123 --> 39:22.561
* And just wanna
get it over with *

39:24.094 --> 39:27.331
* Tears form
behind my eyes *

39:27.364 --> 39:31.836
* But I do not cry

39:31.869 --> 39:36.041
* Countin' the days
that pass me by *

39:38.976 --> 39:44.282
* I've been searchin'
deep down in my soul *

39:45.617 --> 39:47.552
* Words that I'm hearin'

39:47.585 --> 39:52.056
* Are starting to get old

39:52.090 --> 39:54.793
* Feels like I'm startin'

39:54.826 --> 39:58.429
* All over again

39:58.463 --> 40:02.601
* The last three years
were just pretend *

40:02.634 --> 40:06.036
* And I said

40:06.070 --> 40:10.375
* Good-bye to you

40:10.407 --> 40:13.744
* Good-bye to everything

40:13.778 --> 40:17.014
* That I knew

40:18.182 --> 40:20.251
* You were the one

40:20.284 --> 40:22.387
* I loved

40:22.420 --> 40:24.556
* The one thing
that I tried *

40:24.590 --> 40:29.027
* To hold on to

40:36.001 --> 40:38.168
* I used to get lost

40:38.202 --> 40:40.838
* In your eyes

40:42.673 --> 40:45.744
* And it seems
that I can't live *

40:45.777 --> 40:49.313
* A day without you

40:49.347 --> 40:51.849
* Closin' my eyes

40:51.882 --> 40:55.286
* And you chase
my thoughts away *

40:55.320 --> 40:59.925
* To a place where I am
blinded by the light *

40:59.958 --> 41:02.927
* But it's not right

41:02.960 --> 41:07.431
* Good-bye to you

41:07.465 --> 41:10.802
* Good-bye to everything

41:10.835 --> 41:13.804
* That I knew

41:15.139 --> 41:16.807
* You were the one

41:16.842 --> 41:19.376
* I loved

41:19.409 --> 41:24.983
* The one thing that I tried
to hold on to *

41:31.255 --> 41:34.425
* Ohhh-ohh-ohh

41:38.262 --> 41:41.532
* It hurts to want
everything *

41:41.567 --> 41:45.235
* And nothin'
at the same time *

41:45.269 --> 41:47.005
* I want what's yours

41:47.038 --> 41:50.909
* And I want what's mine

41:53.911 --> 41:55.380
* I want you

41:55.413 --> 41:58.048
* But I'm not givin' in
this time *

41:58.083 --> 42:03.088
* Good-bye to you

42:03.121 --> 42:06.423
* Good-bye
to everything *

42:06.456 --> 42:09.594
* That I knew

42:10.862 --> 42:15.365
* You were the one
I loved *

42:15.400 --> 42:21.338
* The one thing that I tried
to hold on to *

42:21.371 --> 42:26.878
* The one thing that I tried
to hold on to *

42:28.614 --> 42:32.851
* Good-bye to you

42:32.884 --> 42:36.420
* Good-bye to everything

42:36.454 --> 42:39.489
* That I knew

42:40.826 --> 42:44.262
* You were the one
I loved *

43:17.327 --> 43:19.764
Grr! Arrgh!
