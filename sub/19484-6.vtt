[Paula] <i>I walk outside</i>
<i>and I see typography everywhere.</i>

00:20.895 --> 00:22.897
<i>New York City is a city of signs.</i>

00:24.691 --> 00:26.359
<i>Sometimes things written by hand,</i>

00:27.068 --> 00:28.069
<i>mismatched,</i>

00:28.570 --> 00:30.155
<i>hung up in some peculiar way.</i>

00:31.489 --> 00:34.534
<i>You think, "Oh my God, can I get up there</i>
<i>and please readjust that sign?</i>

00:34.617 --> 00:36.536
<i>That's just absolutely awful!"</i>

00:37.203 --> 00:41.416
<i>The way numbers are on doors.</i>
<i>No two the same down the block.</i>

00:42.834 --> 00:45.545
<i>All messages are different,</i>
<i>and they're everywhere.</i>

00:47.547 --> 00:50.800
<i>Typography is painting with words.</i>

00:52.302 --> 00:53.678
<i>That's my biggest high.</i>

00:54.179 --> 00:55.555
It's my crack.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.140
[funky music playing]

01:05.440 --> 01:08.943
[Lupton] <i>Paula Scher</i>
<i>is the goddess of graphic design.</i>

01:10.028 --> 01:12.238
<i>Her stuff is everywhere!</i>

01:17.410 --> 01:19.621
[Bierut] <i>Paula's been able to come up with</i>

01:19.704 --> 01:23.166
<i>more ways to make type talk</i>
<i>than anyone else,</i>

01:23.249 --> 01:26.377
<i>and to create a distinctive body of work</i>
<i>just with letters.</i>

02:20.682 --> 02:22.308
[Paula] <i>When I go to work every day,</i>

02:22.809 --> 02:27.230
<i>I feel like I'm navigating myself</i>
<i>through a maze.</i>

02:27.313 --> 02:28.731
-Hey.
-[colleague] How are you?

02:33.278 --> 02:35.697
Look at this! A real type book!

02:36.406 --> 02:38.741
-Can you bring this to Courtney?
-[colleague] Yeah.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.244
[Paula] <i>I sit nose to nose</i>
<i>with my partners.</i>

02:41.327 --> 02:42.871
<i>My team is on the fourth floor.</i>

02:42.954 --> 02:45.206
<i>I have to run up and down steps</i>
<i>to see them.</i>

02:45.290 --> 02:48.042
I actually like this.
I think you should move 'em lower.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.752
<i>It's very quick paced.</i>

02:49.836 --> 02:51.963
You're seeing something
that looks like this.

02:52.046 --> 02:54.299
<i>I'm solving things on scraps of paper.</i>

02:55.133 --> 02:57.135
<i>Starting something, getting interrupted...</i>

02:57.218 --> 02:58.511
-[colleague] Paula?
-Yeah?

02:58.595 --> 03:00.138
<i>The interruption is great.</i>

03:00.221 --> 03:04.183
I like the way the icons
also interrelate with the thing.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.603
<i>Pentagram is a design cooperative.</i>

03:06.686 --> 03:08.563
There's the benefit of a large firm,

03:08.646 --> 03:10.940
but everybody gets to act
like they're an individual.

03:11.649 --> 03:14.068
<i>There's no boss. Just friends.</i>

03:14.694 --> 03:18.406
[Bierut] <i>Pentagram's a supergroup</i>
<i>of the most famous designers in the world</i>

03:18.489 --> 03:20.241
<i>doing the best work in the world.</i>

03:20.325 --> 03:25.371
It's like an all-star team, and Paula is
the indispensable player on that team.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.790
That one's my favorite so far.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.418
[Bierut] <i>We all have</i>
<i>our own individual style,</i>

03:30.501 --> 03:31.836
<i>individual way of working.</i>

03:33.963 --> 03:37.550
[Paula] <i>I could never walk into an office</i>
<i>and sit down at my desk to design,</i>

03:37.634 --> 03:38.927
<i>I would accomplish nothing.</i>

03:39.761 --> 03:41.930
<i>I can sit down at my desk</i>
<i>to read my e-mail.</i>

03:42.513 --> 03:43.806
<i>You go through your junk mail...</i>

03:43.890 --> 03:44.724
A lot of crap.

03:44.807 --> 03:47.227
<i>You throw it all out,</i>
<i>you make a little order on your desk,</i>

03:47.810 --> 03:50.813
<i>and then you go, "Oh, my God,</i>
<i>how am I going to solve this problem?"</i>

03:52.857 --> 03:54.275
<i>Then, you walk up the stairs,</i>

03:54.359 --> 03:57.570
<i>go into the ladies' room,</i>
<i>put on your lipstick and figure it out.</i>

04:01.866 --> 04:02.700
[colleague] It's...

04:02.784 --> 04:05.620
I love it like that. It's very slurpy.

04:05.703 --> 04:07.497
-Slurpy, yeah.
-Don't you think?

04:07.580 --> 04:08.539
Yeah, I like that.

04:08.998 --> 04:12.001
[Paula] <i>Ideas can be triggered</i>
<i>by working with my team.</i>

04:12.085 --> 04:13.253
[Paula] ...optical illusion.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.756
<i>I see more than I would see</i>
<i>if I was just doing it all by myself.</i>

04:16.839 --> 04:17.966
<i>It's fantastic.</i>

04:18.466 --> 04:22.136
I think that you have to make
"Girls" and "Boys" the same weight,

04:22.220 --> 04:24.389
with the exception of the pointy things.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.725
And then figure out
how the other type intersects.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.560
And then we gotta figure out color.

04:30.311 --> 04:34.440
<i>We're working on the Summer Festival</i>
<i>posters for the Public Theater.</i>

04:34.524 --> 04:38.152
They put on free Shakespeare
in Central Park every summer.

04:38.236 --> 04:43.366
So, like here it says,
<i>Taming of the Shrew </i>inside the wrap.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.660
You don't have to do that work
with the whole name.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.912
You're putting this
in a kind of lozenge shape.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.248
-I think it'll be cool.
-Yeah, it looks really fun.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.083
So, give it a shot!

04:57.547 --> 05:00.800
<i>I've been designing</i>
<i>for the Public Theater since 1994.</i>

05:02.176 --> 05:05.596
<i>My first project was</i>
<i>creating an identity for the Theater.</i>

05:06.556 --> 05:09.225
<i>When they hired me,</i>
<i>they had a name issue.</i>

05:10.226 --> 05:12.645
[Wolfe] <i>One of the things</i>
<i>that was very challenging</i>

05:12.729 --> 05:14.480
about the Public Theater,
it had multiple identities:

05:14.564 --> 05:15.606
it was the Public Theater,

05:16.190 --> 05:19.277
<i>and then some people called it</i>
<i>the Joseph Papp Public Theater,</i>

05:19.360 --> 05:21.362
<i>and then there was</i>
<i>Shakespeare in Central Park.</i>

05:21.863 --> 05:25.283
I wanted everything
to feel like it was of one.

05:25.366 --> 05:28.328
<i>That it was breathing fully</i>
<i>as an institution.</i>

05:29.162 --> 05:31.247
[Paula] <i>It had to be populous.</i>

05:31.331 --> 05:36.169
I knew it had to be New Yorkish,
meaning it had to be loud and proud.

05:41.966 --> 05:45.386
I was flipping through one of my books

05:45.470 --> 05:47.055
on American wood type.

05:47.138 --> 05:53.227
I like American wood type because
it's powerful, and it has many forms.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.440
On this particular page were these Rs,

05:57.523 --> 06:01.402
and they go back to the skinniest form
or to the widest form,

06:01.486 --> 06:07.241
and I realized I could make the word
"Public" in the same kind of weights,

06:07.325 --> 06:10.536
and it would symbolize all of New York.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.539
Every type of weight was included.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.919
<i>You can create</i>
<i>an identity for a whole place</i>

06:18.503 --> 06:21.047
<i>based on a recognizability of type.</i>

06:24.717 --> 06:29.555
[Wolfe] <i>Paula's work pulled people in.</i>
<i>You instantly knew, "The Public."</i>

06:30.139 --> 06:35.311
<i>It's a language that could be dissected,</i>
<i>taken apart, put back together.</i>

06:35.394 --> 06:38.022
That's one the things
I think is thrilling about it.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.944
[Paula] <i>Typography can create</i>
<i>immense power.</i>

06:43.778 --> 06:46.739
<i>You're working with things</i>
<i>that create character.</i>

06:46.823 --> 06:48.491
<i>You're working with weight.</i>

06:48.574 --> 06:50.535
<i>You're working with height.</i>

06:50.993 --> 06:53.663
<i>If you take an E,</i>

06:53.746 --> 06:57.792
<i>and the middle bar is the same length</i>
<i>as the ends of the E's,</i>

06:57.875 --> 07:01.879
<i>it feels different than if the little bar</i>
<i>is half the length of the E's.</i>

07:02.588 --> 07:05.675
<i>If you lift the little bar up higher,</i>

07:05.758 --> 07:09.971
<i>it will make the typeface look</i>
<i>like it was drawn in the 1930s.</i>

07:10.054 --> 07:12.723
<i>The same thing as</i>
<i>if you drop the middle bar lower,</i>

07:12.807 --> 07:14.475
<i>it will look moderne.</i>

07:14.559 --> 07:19.355
<i>If a font is heavy and bold,</i>
<i>it may give you a feeling of immediacy.</i>

07:19.439 --> 07:24.777
<i>If a font is thin and has a serif form,</i>
<i>it may feel classical.</i>

07:25.528 --> 07:30.366
So that, before you even read it,
you have sensibility and spirit.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.911
And that, if you combine that
with a meaning,

07:34.495 --> 07:36.038
<i>then that's spectacular.</i>

07:40.209 --> 07:42.003
<i>When I did the High Line logo,</i>

07:42.086 --> 07:45.673
<i>the goal was to make it look more like</i>
<i>a railroad track than an H.</i>

07:46.299 --> 07:50.136
<i>If you take the kind of weight that</i>
<i>might make the line for a railroad track,</i>

07:50.219 --> 07:54.182
<i>and you put two horizontal bars across it,</i>

07:54.265 --> 07:56.309
<i>it begins to look fairly industrial.</i>

07:57.143 --> 07:59.145
<i>It totally changes the spirit</i>

07:59.228 --> 08:02.940
<i>without having to create</i>
<i>any kind of illustrative narrative.</i>

08:20.374 --> 08:24.712
<i>I used to paint my fonts by hand,</i>
<i>when I was a young designer,</i>

08:24.795 --> 08:26.547
<i>and I really miss it.</i>

08:28.424 --> 08:31.886
<i>When we became fully computerized</i>
<i>in the late '90s,</i>

08:31.969 --> 08:34.972
<i>I didn't touch anything</i>
<i>and I didn't use my hands.</i>

08:35.056 --> 08:39.519
In the past, I cut things up,
I ripped things, I pasted things.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.230
<i>I touched art supplies.</i>

08:43.272 --> 08:47.652
<i>That physical loss was huge for me,</i>
<i>and that's why I started painting.</i>

08:48.236 --> 08:50.112
Uh-oh. That's Utah.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.783
<i>I deliberately began painting the maps</i>

08:53.866 --> 08:57.578
<i>because they would take me</i>
<i>a long time to accomplish,</i>

08:57.662 --> 08:59.914
<i>in some very rote way,</i>

08:59.997 --> 09:02.416
<i>and that's actually everything</i>
<i>that went away.</i>

09:03.501 --> 09:08.339
These dotted lines are the distances
between two given points

09:08.422 --> 09:11.133
and the background is the zip codes.

09:11.842 --> 09:14.428
It's not factual, it's emotional.

09:14.512 --> 09:17.348
Like Wyoming doesn't have
very many people in it,

09:17.431 --> 09:19.433
but you feel it instead of know it.

09:23.437 --> 09:27.608
<i>I'm not making</i>
<i>something designed to answer questions,</i>

09:27.692 --> 09:29.360
<i>it's more a design to raise them.</i>

09:30.570 --> 09:33.406
This painting is
counties and zip codes.

09:35.032 --> 09:38.369
<i>Why do some little states</i>
<i>have a million counties,</i>

09:38.452 --> 09:40.454
<i>and some big states have very few?</i>

09:43.082 --> 09:46.210
Now this one is a demographic map:

09:46.294 --> 09:49.922
<i>average age of people,</i>
<i>racial and ethnic breakdowns.</i>

09:50.548 --> 09:53.884
<i>To actually have any sense of it,</i>
<i>you actually have to sit and read it.</i>

09:53.968 --> 09:57.805
But, the information is
equivalently complicated and ridiculous.

10:06.606 --> 10:10.651
I used to make complicated,
nonsensical charts

10:10.735 --> 10:12.737
and diagrams that were satirical.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.533
<i>Silly information. Fractured information.</i>

10:17.617 --> 10:19.910
<i>And I did it to make points.</i>

10:21.495 --> 10:25.291
<i>Then I started charting</i>
<i>things that were not chartable.</i>

10:26.292 --> 10:28.878
<i>Mostly denigrating</i>
<i>my own physical appearance.</i>

10:30.379 --> 10:32.506
<i>I find it funny.</i>

10:32.840 --> 10:35.635
<i>Sometimes they're pithy</i>
<i>and more meaningful,</i>

10:35.718 --> 10:38.387
<i>like all my numbers on my credit cards,</i>

10:38.471 --> 10:41.182
<i>just to show how many numbers</i>
<i>were attached to my name</i>

10:41.265 --> 10:43.267
<i>and they're</i>
<i>in some computer somewhere.</i>

10:44.310 --> 10:46.228
<i>Later, they became political.</i>

10:46.812 --> 10:48.397
<i>Or nonsensical.</i>

10:49.607 --> 10:51.942
<i>Ultimately, it turned into my paintings.</i>

10:53.444 --> 10:56.530
That one has a period,
maybe they should have periods.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.783
[director] So Paula, these paintings,

10:58.866 --> 11:01.786
they seem to have
a little obsessional quality to them.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.538
Yeah, I think they're quite obsessive.

11:05.122 --> 11:10.086
<i>It's the act of weaving little bits</i>
<i>of information to make a bigger thing.</i>

11:10.169 --> 11:13.756
That's definitely stronger than that.
This one needs to be stronger over here.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.216
<i>It started when I was very young.</i>

11:16.759 --> 11:21.347
<i>I had this very high IQ score in something</i>
<i>called quantitative reasoning.</i>

11:21.430 --> 11:23.641
<i>My family thought it was going to be Math,</i>

11:23.724 --> 11:24.767
but it wasn't.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.436
It was the ability to synthesize a lot
of information

11:27.520 --> 11:28.813
and come to a conclusion.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.815
A self-portrait.

11:31.273 --> 11:34.443
<i>And I was happiest</i>
<i>when I was making things.</i>

11:34.527 --> 11:36.737
<i>1956, orthopedic shoes,</i>

11:36.821 --> 11:40.032
<i>1959, developed a contempt</i>
<i>for Girl Scouts,</i>

11:40.116 --> 11:42.326
<i>1953, discovered I'm Jewish.</i>

11:42.410 --> 11:44.161
<i>Every hairdo I ever had:</i>

11:44.245 --> 11:46.497
<i>the Blunt Cut, the Sassoon, the Shag,</i>

11:46.580 --> 11:49.875
<i>the Summer Blonde, the Platinum Blonde,</i>
<i>the Streaked Blonde, the Reddish Blonde,</i>

11:49.959 --> 11:51.168
<i>and No Blonde.</i>

11:52.002 --> 11:55.548
<i>I didn't really fit in very well</i>
<i>in high school.</i>

11:56.090 --> 11:58.175
<i>I mean, I was</i>
<i>a person who went to art classes</i>

11:58.259 --> 12:00.094
<i>instead of going to the football games.</i>

12:00.177 --> 12:02.179
<i>There's something wrong with you</i>
<i>if you do that.</i>

12:04.932 --> 12:08.728
<i>Then I was at the Tyler School of Art</i>
<i>studying Illustration,</i>

12:09.103 --> 12:12.565
<i>and I fell in love with typography</i>
<i>in a way I didn't expect to.</i>

12:14.650 --> 12:17.194
I was influenced by contemporary culture.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.946
<i>Zig-Zag rolling papers,</i>

12:19.029 --> 12:20.197
<i>Zap comics,</i>

12:20.281 --> 12:23.742
<i>underground newspapers</i>
<i>and magazines and record covers.</i>

12:23.826 --> 12:25.202
<i>Especially record covers.</i>

12:25.286 --> 12:27.913
Those were the things
that I really wanted to do.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.123
They spoke to me.

12:36.547 --> 12:40.301
<i>I got a job designing record covers</i>
<i>at CBS Records in the '70s.</i>

12:43.596 --> 12:45.347
<i>I'd combine the illustration</i>

12:45.431 --> 12:49.477
<i>with typography that related</i>
<i>to the illustration or contrasted it.</i>

12:50.519 --> 12:54.106
[Bierut] <i>I first became aware of</i>
<i>Paula's name in high school in the '70s.</i>

12:55.483 --> 12:57.776
<i>I'd spend three hours in a record store.</i>

12:57.860 --> 13:00.404
I'd stand at those racks
and look at the covers.

13:00.488 --> 13:03.407
<i>I'd be like, "Wow,</i>
<i>I really like the way that cover looks."</i>

13:03.491 --> 13:06.619
<i>I'd turn it over</i>
<i>and see Paula Scher's name,</i>

13:06.702 --> 13:07.745
<i>over and over again.</i>

13:08.454 --> 13:12.374
[Paula] <i>I was a kid with the best job</i>
<i>in New York City.</i>

13:13.167 --> 13:15.169
<i>I had recording artists</i>
<i>and their managers,</i>

13:15.252 --> 13:17.379
<i>all these people</i>
<i>coming in and out of my office.</i>

13:17.463 --> 13:20.132
<i>And always trying</i>
<i>to keep these balls in the air</i>

13:20.216 --> 13:25.179
<i>to get them to agree to some design</i>
<i>and get it to come to fruition.</i>

13:25.262 --> 13:26.972
<i>And I just became very good at it.</i>

13:34.313 --> 13:38.400
<i>Big recording artists were the things</i>
<i>the company cared about the most.</i>

13:39.318 --> 13:44.198
So I would do pretty much what
the recording artists wanted me to do.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.825
Like for example,
here on this Bruce Springsteen cover.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.495
It was shot by a friend of his
who was a butcher,

13:49.578 --> 13:51.956
and I put
this typewriter typography on it.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.500
Cheap Trick<i> </i>was a little bit different.

13:54.583 --> 13:58.462
They weren't as big as Bruce Springsteen,
so I had a bit more control.

13:59.046 --> 14:02.174
With jazz artists,
they got to be a little artier.

14:02.258 --> 14:06.428
Like, this is a series of covers I did
for Bob James's label,

14:06.512 --> 14:07.763
Tappan Zee Records,

14:07.846 --> 14:12.393
<i>and they were all single objects</i>
<i>that were blown up out of scale.</i>

14:12.476 --> 14:14.395
My favorite was always this matchbook.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.024
And then, of course,
the monster illustration,<i> Boston</i>.

14:19.733 --> 14:23.320
Six million copies, I think,
in the first month of sales.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.072
It was quite something.

14:26.782 --> 14:30.369
<i>They wanted it to be something futuristic,</i>

14:30.452 --> 14:34.999
<i>so we came up with this half-baked idea</i>
<i>that the Earth was blowing up</i>

14:35.332 --> 14:38.168
<i>and all these spaceships were escaping.</i>

14:38.252 --> 14:40.170
<i>Guitar-shaped spaceships.</i>

14:40.254 --> 14:43.132
And they left the planet Earth
and went up in the heavens.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.343

14:46.427 --> 14:50.472

<i>They used to play ♪</i>

14:50.556 --> 14:51.599
[song stops abruptly]

14:51.682 --> 14:53.976
The<i> </i>Boston cover is dumb.

14:54.560 --> 15:00.190
<i>I am still mystified by how something</i>
<i>like that really resonates in culture.</i>

15:00.274 --> 15:02.192
<i>I mean, it predated </i>Star Wars<i>.</i>

15:02.276 --> 15:06.155
<i>So we must have hit a zeitgeist</i>
<i>that was about to happen.</i>

15:06.238 --> 15:10.534
But when I die, it will say,
"Designed the Boston cover,"

15:10.618 --> 15:13.370
and I've lived
with this horror ever since,

15:13.454 --> 15:15.581
and I think it may wind up being true.

15:16.290 --> 15:21.295
However, if nobody cared about the album,
that's where I did typography.

15:21.879 --> 15:25.716
And that was what I liked doing most
because I was the artist,

15:25.799 --> 15:29.762
I was the one that controlled
what these things looked like.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.097
So, Charles Mingus, <i>One </i>and <i>Two,</i>

15:32.181 --> 15:34.224
and he didn't care what was on the cover.

15:34.308 --> 15:38.479
This was a reissue of a whole pile
of Yardbird songs,

15:38.562 --> 15:41.565
and these things
I really, really loved making.

15:44.151 --> 15:46.820
<i>Over a period of four or five years,</i>

15:47.321 --> 15:50.366
<i>the typography came forward</i>
<i>and the images moved to the background.</i>

15:51.909 --> 15:54.036
<i>I had made this radical shift</i>

15:54.536 --> 15:58.290
<i>and developed the way I would work</i>
<i>for the next 30 years.</i>

15:59.583 --> 16:03.712
<i>I'd learned so much about typography,</i>
<i>and became known for it.</i>

16:11.929 --> 16:16.558
[Lupton] <i>Paula was always</i>
<i>part of popular culture,</i>

16:16.642 --> 16:21.689
but bringing a unique
graphic design voice to that,

16:21.772 --> 16:25.651
very much embodied
in her use of typography.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.489
[Paula] <i>Ideas come all kinds of ways.</i>

16:32.032 --> 16:35.828
<i>I get my best ideas in taxicabs, you know,</i>
<i>like sitting in traffic, drooling.</i>

16:40.290 --> 16:43.002
<i>I'm allowing my subconscious to take over,</i>

16:45.212 --> 16:47.631
<i>so that I can free associate.</i>

16:50.134 --> 16:52.011
You have to be
in a state of play to design.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.305
<i>If you're not in a state of play,</i>
<i>you can't make anything.</i>

17:07.985 --> 17:10.487
It should really start
like almost with that bar,

17:10.571 --> 17:13.115
like if you drop it down
about a sixteenth of an inch

17:13.198 --> 17:16.410
and then, when you put "Pier"
on the end of it, it's really nice.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.494
Mm-hmm.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.456
This is an identity for Pier 55,

17:20.539 --> 17:24.251
which is the park they're building
in the Hudson River.

17:24.334 --> 17:27.463
<i>It is going to have three theaters on it,</i>

17:27.546 --> 17:30.924
<i>and the theaters are going to be</i>
<i>outdoor festival spaces.</i>

17:31.425 --> 17:33.218
We started working with these fives

17:33.302 --> 17:36.430
and some of the fives are just made up
of geometric shapes

17:36.513 --> 17:38.932
that come from the park itself.

17:39.558 --> 17:43.103
For example, the forms come from
the amphitheater

17:43.187 --> 17:45.773
and then they create the 55s.

17:46.356 --> 17:51.028
This notion actually came from the fact
that the park sits up on these pillars.

17:51.111 --> 17:52.738
So these are the original sketches.

17:52.821 --> 17:53.822
Somewhere I knew

17:53.906 --> 17:57.159
that I wanted this thing to feel
like it was on water or underwater.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.079
Built these platforms
that this island's sitting on.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.664
This is actually a more literal
translation of them here.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.542
And then it started to abstract
and become open.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.253
These are really good sketches.

<i>and lots of ways.</i>

18:26.230 --> 18:29.441
<i>I generally try to want to push something</i>
<i>as far as it can be pushed.</i>

18:31.401 --> 18:33.153
<i>For me, that's the fun.</i>

18:41.662 --> 18:45.415

18:47.668 --> 18:49.336

18:51.046 --> 18:52.965
<i>It's hard to make that a guess,</i>

18:53.048 --> 18:56.385
<i>and so you want to design something</i>
<i>that can be adapted to its time.</i>

18:58.887 --> 19:02.349
<i>I've redesigned the Public Theater logo</i>

<i>would be the Palm Beach Ballot of 2001.</i>

26:39.014 --> 26:42.183
<i>I actually did an article</i>
<i>on the Op-Ed page of the </i>New York Times

26:42.267 --> 26:46.104
<i>where I made a little diagram that showed</i>
<i>why the ballot design was wrong.</i>

26:49.524 --> 26:52.736
[man on TV] <i>For the woman who designed</i>
<i>Palm Beach County, Florida's ballot,</i>

26:52.819 --> 26:53.903
<i>life has changed.</i>

26:53.987 --> 26:55.196
<i>I keep thinking it's a nightmare</i>

26:55.280 --> 26:57.741
<i>and I'm going to wake up one day,</i>
<i>and it's gonna be gone.</i>

26:59.326 --> 27:01.286
[Paula] <i>It was a butterfly ballot.</i>

27:02.203 --> 27:05.874
<i>The list of the names broken</i>
<i>into two columns.</i>

27:06.374 --> 27:09.878
<i>The designer could not make</i>
<i>one long vertical list</i>

27:09.961 --> 27:12.088
<i>because the names would be too small,</i>

27:12.172 --> 27:15.508
<i>and in the area of Palm Beach County,</i>
<i>there are a lot of elderly people,</i>

27:15.592 --> 27:17.469
<i>and they wouldn't be able</i>
<i>to read small text.</i>

27:18.261 --> 27:20.889
<i>So she thought she was doing a service.</i>

27:21.765 --> 27:26.561
<i>In the first column, George Bush was first</i>
<i>and Al Gore was second.</i>

27:26.645 --> 27:29.147
<i>And then on the other side</i>
<i>was Pat Buchanan.</i>

27:29.230 --> 27:32.609
She had the holes that you punched
in the center,

27:33.193 --> 27:36.154
<i>except for the holes weren't</i>
<i>where you thought they were going to be.</i>

27:36.780 --> 27:42.035
<i>You assume that if the first hole</i>
<i>belonged to George Bush,</i>

27:42.118 --> 27:45.497
<i>that the second hole, right below it,</i>
<i>would belong to Al Gore.</i>

27:46.081 --> 27:50.668
<i>But in fact, it belonged to Pat Buchanan,</i>
<i>because the holes were staggered.</i>

27:51.002 --> 27:53.171
<i>So in Palm Beach County,</i>

27:53.254 --> 27:55.882
one of the biggest
Jewish residences in the world,

27:55.965 --> 27:59.260
a big part of the population
voted for an anti-Semite.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.054
<i>I can't go back and say,</i>

28:01.137 --> 28:04.015
<i>"Well, you know, if I would have done</i>
<i>something else differently,</i>

28:04.099 --> 28:06.393
<i>maybe the election</i>
<i>would have been different,"</i>

28:06.476 --> 28:08.520
<i>because you don't know.</i>

28:08.603 --> 28:10.939
Absolutely.
Graphic Design threw an election.

28:20.824 --> 28:24.369
Right now, because I'm trying
to make an exhibit opening,

28:24.911 --> 28:26.538
I'm working really intensely.

28:26.621 --> 28:31.084
Like, I'll typically start
around nine in the morning,

28:31.167 --> 28:33.753
and I can work till midnight
or one or two in the morning.

28:38.174 --> 28:41.803
I used to paint to jazz
and I got sick of all my records.

28:41.886 --> 28:45.432
So then I started playing
old movies on television.

28:45.515 --> 28:49.269
I can do the dialogue right along with it.
It's sort of like singing while you work.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.479
[TV and Paula]
"When a man's partner's killed,

28:51.563 --> 28:53.690
he's supposed to do something about it."

28:54.441 --> 28:57.235
<i>All About Eve</i>. Fantastic!

28:57.819 --> 29:01.948
[TV and Paula] "Fasten your seat belts,
it's going to be a bumpy night."

29:03.032 --> 29:05.660
<i>The Women,</i> that's really good,
it's really good.

29:05.744 --> 29:06.911
Really good dialogue.

29:07.495 --> 29:09.330
<i>When anything I wear</i>
<i>doesn't please Steven...</i>

29:09.414 --> 29:11.166
[TV and Paula] "... I take it off!"

29:14.461 --> 29:16.838
<i>There were no artist models in my family.</i>

29:17.714 --> 29:20.425
<i>The family was very well educated.</i>

29:20.508 --> 29:22.510
<i>All the women were schoolteachers.</i>

29:23.344 --> 29:26.347
<i>And my father was actually a mapmaker.</i>

29:29.434 --> 29:34.105
<i>He invented a measuring device</i>
<i>so that maps would be more accurate.</i>

29:37.859 --> 29:42.697
<i>When I was a little girl,</i>
<i>he taught me that maps were distorted,</i>

29:42.781 --> 29:45.867
<i>that they never accurately depict a place.</i>

29:48.953 --> 29:54.334
My father actually thought art was stupid
and serious people became engineers.

30:02.175 --> 30:04.928
[upbeat piano music playing]

30:25.073 --> 30:29.536
[Lupton] <i>Paula has created</i>
<i>a typographic language</i>

30:29.619 --> 30:36.459
<i>that is popular, it's American,</i>
<i>it's New York,</i>

30:36.543 --> 30:38.837
that makes sense to people.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.589
And it's part of everyday life.

30:41.673 --> 30:46.427
<i>It's not an art form that is</i>
<i>in some other place.</i>

30:47.136 --> 30:51.683
<i>It's in the street,</i>
<i>it's on the shelf at the supermarket.</i>

30:51.766 --> 30:57.522
Paula is the most influential
woman graphic designer on the planet.

30:59.274 --> 31:02.068
[Paula] <i>I never thought about myself</i>
<i>as a feminist.</i>

31:03.278 --> 31:06.072
<i>Yet, when I was working</i>
<i>at CBS Records in the '70s,</i>

31:06.155 --> 31:10.076
<i>women in the design business</i>
<i>at that time were agents, they were reps.</i>

31:11.703 --> 31:14.539
<i>You'd sit there and think, "Oh, my God,</i>
<i>what are they going to do with me?</i>

31:14.622 --> 31:16.040
<i>What am I going to do with them?"</i>

31:18.084 --> 31:20.879
<i>It's quite wild when you see it firsthand.</i>

31:20.962 --> 31:24.299
All of a sudden, you turn around
and you go, "Oh, my God, that was sexism!"

31:24.382 --> 31:25.633
You know, there it is.

31:25.717 --> 31:29.095
And it's like any other -ism.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.935
<i>If I'm sitting with a new client,</i>
<i>I can see in the first glance</i>

31:36.019 --> 31:38.396
that he's wondering
why he's got this old lady.

31:41.232 --> 31:44.986
I mean, I just thought,
"I'm a designer. Look at it."

31:47.530 --> 31:51.117
Hi! Nice to meet you on the phone.

31:52.118 --> 31:55.204
I got your materials
that I've been looking at.

31:55.705 --> 31:58.249
What are you looking to do now?

31:59.918 --> 32:04.088
<i>I have an overall plan</i>
<i>about how I'd approach work.</i>

32:04.172 --> 32:07.216
<i>Some of it is strategic</i>
<i>and some of it is intuitive.</i>

32:07.300 --> 32:10.637
Are you promoting the institution
or are you promoting the show?

32:11.387 --> 32:15.475
<i>The strategic part</i>
<i>is absorbing information from the client.</i>

32:15.558 --> 32:18.102
How many plays do you put on in a season?

32:19.270 --> 32:23.149
And do you have other kinds of festivals,
or smaller programs,

32:23.232 --> 32:25.151
or things like under the radar, or...?

32:26.402 --> 32:29.822
<i>I want to understand</i>
<i>why they look the way they look.</i>

32:30.323 --> 32:33.701
What's interesting is you seem,
from what I see here,

32:33.785 --> 32:36.412
to be a little bit all over the map.

32:36.496 --> 32:39.332
I think you should develop
a visual language.

32:39.415 --> 32:41.751
That's what we did
with The Public and Atlantic.

32:41.834 --> 32:43.795
You don't need
to see the logo to know what it is.

32:45.630 --> 32:49.717
You should be as powerful,
visible, understandable,

32:49.801 --> 32:52.095
recognizable as anything in town.

32:54.555 --> 32:56.641
<i>You're not changing somebody.</i>

32:56.724 --> 33:00.269
<i>You're making them a more perfect vision</i>
<i>of where they started.</i>

33:00.353 --> 33:03.982
<i>So the job is to traverse</i>
<i>these different roads</i>

33:04.065 --> 33:06.567
and try to get either an individual,
a group of people,

33:06.651 --> 33:09.487
or a whole corporation to be able to see.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.823
[applause]

33:14.200 --> 33:20.915
[Paula] <i>In 1998, Citibank was merging</i>
<i>with Travelers Insurance Company.</i>

33:21.499 --> 33:25.211
<i>They wanted a logo</i>
<i>that reflected the merger</i>

33:25.294 --> 33:27.630
and they wanted to launch it
in the newspaper

33:27.714 --> 33:30.258
three weeks after hiring us to do it.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.219
<i>Travelers Insurance Company</i>
<i>had a red umbrella.</i>

33:33.302 --> 33:37.181
<i>Citibank had type</i>
<i>that was in italic form.</i>

33:37.640 --> 33:40.560
<i>It took only a moment of time</i>
<i>to design the logo.</i>

33:41.144 --> 33:42.061
There's a T.

33:42.145 --> 33:45.690
The bottom of a lowercase T
has a little hook on the bottom.

33:45.773 --> 33:46.899
It's a straight line.

33:46.983 --> 33:50.153
If you put an arc on the top,
that's an umbrella.

33:50.236 --> 33:51.779
There are two Is in Citi.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.615
It means the edge of the arc
can line up with the two Is.

33:55.324 --> 33:58.244
<i>There were a million meetings</i>
<i>trying to get by 'em.</i>

33:58.327 --> 34:00.246
<i>"What if you do it this way, or that way?</i>

34:00.329 --> 34:02.540
<i>Show it to me on stationery,</i>
<i>show it to me on a card.</i>

34:02.623 --> 34:04.917
<i>It's got to be red on top</i>
<i>and blue on the bottom.</i>

34:05.001 --> 34:07.795
<i>What do you do with the blue wave?</i>
<i>Is it something you use in retail?</i>

34:07.879 --> 34:09.797
<i>What if you put that</i>
<i>back on the credit card?"</i>

34:09.881 --> 34:12.800
Those were all the things
that were being worked out

34:12.884 --> 34:15.678
for nearly, I think, two years
before the thing launched.

34:17.555 --> 34:21.976
<i>The design of the logo is never really</i>
<i>the hard part of the job.</i>

34:22.060 --> 34:24.228
It's persuading
a million people to use it.

34:33.571 --> 34:35.823
So this is a diagram of a meeting.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.451
You are giving a presentation.

34:39.494 --> 34:45.208
This line is the line of the reasonable
level of expectation that everyone has

34:45.291 --> 34:47.210
when you walk into the room.

34:47.293 --> 34:51.380
I got to say that, to my surprise,
I very much like the black and white.

34:52.298 --> 34:53.591
[Paula] <i>You begin to present,</i>

34:54.550 --> 34:57.345
and you come above
the reasonable level of expectation.

34:57.428 --> 35:01.599
<i>Everybody gets enthusiastic,</i>
<i>people begin to start asking questions.</i>

35:01.682 --> 35:07.730
...a whole extra outline, right?
The others only have three.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.607
<i>And about right here,</i>

35:09.690 --> 35:12.401
<i>you've reached the height</i>
<i>of the appreciation</i>

35:12.485 --> 35:14.904
<i>that you're gonna get</i>
<i>for this presentation.</i>

35:15.446 --> 35:19.075
You will be putting them
on top of images where they create labels.

35:19.158 --> 35:22.203
So it's like a label
smacked over a photograph.

35:22.578 --> 35:26.082
That's the... And we have...
The buses are behind you.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.417
<i>And at this point,</i>

35:29.377 --> 35:32.588
somebody's going to make
a rebuttal to your presentation.

35:32.672 --> 35:39.637
The contrast between the two
is more fun for me here than it is here,

35:39.720 --> 35:42.849
because it's just...
I feel the separation more.

35:42.932 --> 35:45.685
This, I kind of don't notice the contrast.

35:46.144 --> 35:49.730
[Paula] <i>You're going to sink a little bit</i>
<i>below that line of expectation.</i>

35:50.356 --> 35:53.317
You grab it back
and you make some concessions.

35:53.401 --> 35:56.529
You know,
I may have to pull this down a bit.

35:56.612 --> 35:58.781
Maybe it just has to touch it.

35:58.865 --> 36:02.118
The thing is that the horizontal read
is always better.

36:02.201 --> 36:05.788
Yes, see these are great,
the horizontal pops. I love that.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.624
[Paula] <i>And you get up to about here.</i>

36:08.708 --> 36:12.712
And at this point, this is as high
as you're ever gonna get.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.716
It's not as high as here, but it's good.

36:16.799 --> 36:18.718
Will this actually play in this color?

36:19.552 --> 36:22.013
-[Paula] What, you don't think--
-I mean, I love it.

36:22.096 --> 36:23.806
But I'm worried
you're going to change it

36:23.890 --> 36:25.224
when you actually do it.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.559
No, I wanted that.

36:26.642 --> 36:29.687
Just to say, that's the thing
I'm most concerned about.

36:29.770 --> 36:31.647
I just think it needs to be larger.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.524
The meeting must end here,

36:33.608 --> 36:36.861
because what will happen
is a counter-rebuttal to your offer,

36:36.944 --> 36:40.489
it will go down
below the reasonable level of expectation,

36:40.573 --> 36:43.075
and then come back only nearly above it

36:43.159 --> 36:46.579
and will continue on,
until you reach sudden death.

36:47.872 --> 36:51.417
<i>They want proof that this is really,</i>
<i>really gonna work.</i>

36:51.792 --> 36:53.753
<i>The problem is there isn't proof.</i>

36:54.545 --> 36:57.673
<i>It's how do people see and perceive</i>
<i>and accept things.</i>

36:58.299 --> 37:01.260
I feel like, as usual,
once I sit with them for a while,

37:01.344 --> 37:04.972
they really start to shout
in a very specific way

37:05.056 --> 37:07.516
and it just feels like, of course,
this is The Public.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.686
Of course, it's grabbing the attention
that Shakespeare in the Park always does.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.521
-I think they're awesome.
-Fantastic.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.190
It's going to be a black summer.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.274
[laughter]

37:16.275 --> 37:17.902
-All right. Bye.
-Good to see you.

37:18.444 --> 37:20.655
-Terrific. Good work. Thank you.
-Thanks.

37:21.697 --> 37:23.241
-[Patrick] Perfect.
-Thank you.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.544
[Paula] <i>I notice it more and more</i>
<i>as I get older.</i>

37:36.212 --> 37:40.258
<i>How important</i>

<i>My father saw two of the paintings I did</i>

37:51.102 --> 37:52.812

<i>because, of course,</i>
<i>it's totally inaccurate.</i>

37:56.482 --> 37:58.401
And I brought him in
and showed him the map

37:58.484 --> 38:00.653
and I said, "I guess you think I'm crazy,"

38:00.736 --> 38:03.906
and he said,
"No, I never did anything that creative."
