WEBVTT

00:05.606 --> 00:06.507
ACE:
So, we're trying

00:06.640 --> 00:08.509
to figure out who currently

00:08.642 --> 00:11.179
has Charity's soul pieces
inside their body.

00:11.312 --> 00:15.283
Nancy and Park think that the
soul passes on generationally.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.618
The FBI field office
in Boston is

00:17.751 --> 00:20.020
prioritizing a search
for firstborn

00:20.154 --> 00:21.989
descendants of
Gettysburg survivors

00:22.123 --> 00:24.292
who might have passed it on
to next of kin.

00:24.425 --> 00:25.593
Sounds impressive.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.095
Oh, well,
I can beat it.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.829
According to
genealogy theory,

00:28.962 --> 00:33.101
both Jake Cazine and Matthew
Burke inherited Charity's soul

00:33.201 --> 00:35.269
from an ancestor, right?

00:35.369 --> 00:37.004
So I looked
into their family trees,

00:37.138 --> 00:39.173
and they each had a grandparent
who lived to be over 100.

00:39.307 --> 00:42.776
Yeah.
What if having been a vessel

00:42.876 --> 00:44.812
for Charity's soul
actually makes you live longer?

00:44.945 --> 00:47.615
Like the opposite effect
of Odette?
Exactly.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.117
She wants to stay on this plane,

00:49.217 --> 00:50.884
she's got
to keep the host alive.
Mm.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.487
So, my algorithm is
searching

00:53.621 --> 00:55.556
for descendants of Gettysburg
survivors who lived to be 100.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.859
Huh. Equally
impressive.
Thanks.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.494
Uh, I got to get
to this jury duty.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.131
(scoffs)
Worst timing ever
with these kids.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.966
Wait. At the youth center?
What's happening with the kids?

01:06.066 --> 01:08.236
Um, you know,

01:08.369 --> 01:10.971
emotions, pre-teens.
I'll be back by lunch.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.806
Wait. How can you be
so sure?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.642
Well,
I have a bulletproof excuse.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.244
When they ask if I was ever
convicted of a crime,

01:16.377 --> 01:18.846
which they always do,
I say, "Yes."

01:18.979 --> 01:20.848
No one wants a criminal
on their jury.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.350
You were a juvenile.
Aren't your records sealed?

01:22.483 --> 01:24.385
Yeah, doesn't matter.

01:24.518 --> 01:28.256
Truth is, I get asked,
I was convicted.

01:28.389 --> 01:31.425
(entry bell jingles)

01:31.559 --> 01:33.761
(indistinct crowd chatter)
WOMAN:
Order up.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.396
(bell dings)

01:35.529 --> 01:36.930
Thanks for the coffee.
Thank you

01:37.064 --> 01:38.599
for caring.
Yeah, of course I care.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.835
I want to protect this town.
That's why I'm here.

01:43.204 --> 01:46.540
Can you describe how Jake was
acting before he died?

01:46.674 --> 01:49.076
You said his behavior
was a bit erratic?

01:49.210 --> 01:51.078
He was fidgety.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.080
He kept tapping
random objects.

01:53.214 --> 01:56.517
A pen, a rolling pin,
a coffee tamper.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.287
And he kept the temperature
in here at 58 degrees.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.921
It gets freakier.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.056
He started quoting the
Bible out of nowhere.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.792
And he kept
talking about dreams

02:04.925 --> 02:07.695
where he's covered in blood
on a wooded hilltop.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.198
We all have crazy dreams.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.366
When did the behavior start?

02:12.466 --> 02:13.967
After the guy was found

02:14.101 --> 02:15.936
with his chest frozen
at the town carnival.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.872
Jake was in a terrible mood
the whole next day.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.441
I-I thought he was hungover.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.543
And...

02:22.643 --> 02:24.745
he started making these diagrams

02:24.878 --> 02:26.447
on our take-out menus.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.552
MAN: Hey, Kiran,
one more coffee?

02:31.652 --> 02:35.323
Hey. Oh, one last thing.

02:35.456 --> 02:38.759
He had some sort of obsession
with the Hudson family.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.929
With Ryan... and with you.

02:42.062 --> 02:43.664
Sorry if that's weird.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.799
No, that's okay.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.101
(quietly):
Not weird at all.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.637
(phone buzzing)

02:49.770 --> 02:51.171
Hey.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.673
I was actually
just thinking about you.

02:52.806 --> 02:55.943
Same.
Just met with an estate planner.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.945
They're in the middle
of dissolving the last bit

02:58.078 --> 02:59.613
of Hudson Enterprises,

02:59.747 --> 03:02.082
and they found some boxes
of family heirlooms.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.784
So, uh, you know, I don't know.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.786
I thought maybe...
maybe you'd want

03:05.919 --> 03:08.289
to come by, take a look
before they get auctioned off,

03:08.422 --> 03:11.792
see if there's anything
you want to hold on to.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.327
Oh, end of the empire, huh?

03:13.461 --> 03:14.628
Yeah.

03:14.762 --> 03:17.631
Not with a bang,
but more like a whimper.

03:17.765 --> 03:20.668
Yeah, I could stop by for a bit.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.836
Good.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.840
(sighs)

03:29.810 --> 03:32.846
I didn't know
that you run for fun.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.848
Uh, only for charity
and free mugs.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.317
(laughs)

03:36.450 --> 03:38.486
My sister has a cabin
at Winter Harbor.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.954
It is very pretty there
this time of year.
Mm.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.956
We should head up there
sometime.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.892
It'd be nice to get away,
just the two of us.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.695
Well, I can't remember
the last time I took a vacation.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.063
It has been nonstop at work.

03:50.197 --> 03:52.566
142 cases this month alone.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.568
Yeah, I've been slammed, too.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.804
I just got handed
this case two days ago.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.873
I was surprised to get
your substitution of attorney.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.343
It's my first time up against,
in person,

04:02.476 --> 04:05.078
the-the great Carson Drew.

04:05.212 --> 04:06.547
Lucky me.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.582
I don't know how lucky you are.

04:08.716 --> 04:09.817
I've been on a winning streak.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.819
(laughs)
Well, we could leave

04:11.919 --> 04:13.854
for Winter Harbor tonight
if you take a plea.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.523
Why would I do that?

04:15.656 --> 04:17.758
My client is innocent. You...

04:17.891 --> 04:20.828
could drop the charge to a
misdemeanor instead of a felony.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.730
Your client is
a repeat offender.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.733
One charge of petty
theft, as a minor.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.602
He's an 18-year-old kid
accused of stealing a laptop.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.237
You know yourself
the only reason

04:30.371 --> 04:31.772
this case has even seen
the light of day is

04:31.905 --> 04:33.541
because the victim
is a one-percenter.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.509
Theft is theft.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.946
You know, my college roommate
was accused of petty theft.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.882
He went on to help build
the first electric car.

04:42.015 --> 04:45.719
Really? Well...

04:45.853 --> 04:49.122
My first year as a prosecutor,
I chose not to press charges

04:49.256 --> 04:51.191
against someone
for disorderly conduct.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.794
A week later, he got
into a fight with his wife,

04:53.927 --> 04:55.463
he pushed her down the stairs.

04:55.596 --> 04:58.131
She broke three ribs
and almost died.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.100
You couldn't have known.
No.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.803
Not until experience taught me.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.105
See you in court.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.640
Mm-hmm.
(laughs)

05:07.641 --> 05:08.776
(door opens)

05:08.909 --> 05:09.977
(phone buzzes)

05:10.110 --> 05:11.912
(door closes)

05:15.315 --> 05:18.251
(sighs)

05:19.252 --> 05:20.888
BESS:
Think I got

05:20.988 --> 05:22.656
everything of yours
from Nick's loft,

05:22.790 --> 05:24.124
but we should
double-check.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.293
Thank you for
doing this, Bess.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.397
No, hey, it's good
to reclaim your stuff.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.231
You know, set
some boundaries.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.802
Oh. Assume yours.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.269
Technically, his.

05:36.404 --> 05:39.407
Uh, he bought that
for the proposal.

05:39.507 --> 05:43.176
Technically, I did, in case that
makes keeping it any easier.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.178
(scoffs)
Bess.

05:45.312 --> 05:48.482
You know, I thought
that I would feel angry.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.283
I'm good at angry.

05:50.418 --> 05:53.153
But instead, I feel...

05:53.286 --> 05:55.155
I feel empty.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.858
And I never knew that empty
could hurt so much. It's like,

05:57.991 --> 06:01.261
when he talks to me,
his voice is different,

06:01.361 --> 06:04.331
like...
like I'm just some person,

06:04.465 --> 06:05.799
not his person.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.968
(sighs)
Hey.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.639
Scar tissue is
the toughest thing

06:11.772 --> 06:13.273
that our bodies create, so...

06:13.373 --> 06:15.275
No, man.
That's tooth enamel.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.710
That's the toughest
thing we make.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.112
(phone buzzing)

06:19.212 --> 06:21.515
(sighs)

06:21.649 --> 06:23.884
Hold on a second.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.219
Hey, Carson, what's-what's up?

06:26.353 --> 06:27.721
George. Hey.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.190
I have kind of a random favor.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.860
I'm working with a client
who's accused of theft.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.862
His friend was his alibi,

06:34.995 --> 06:38.131
but that friend is now refusing
to take the stand,

06:38.231 --> 06:39.633
and I can't track down any

06:39.733 --> 06:41.802
of my client's family
to vouch for him.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.804
How can I help?
Would I know him?
CARSON: Well, I hope so.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.839
My client is Peter Tombar.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.475
His friend is Felix Raybolt

06:47.575 --> 06:49.477
and he works in the kitchen
at Alunni's.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.878
Have you ever heard of him?

06:51.011 --> 06:52.913
BESS (whispering):
George! George!

06:53.046 --> 06:54.848
Hey.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.986
Actually,
why don't I track down Felix

06:59.086 --> 07:00.754
and convince him to testify?

07:00.888 --> 07:03.591
Sure, yeah,
if-if you're not too busy.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.893
No. Not busy at all.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.260
Okay, great.

07:07.394 --> 07:09.597
That's great.
So, if you can get him

07:09.730 --> 07:11.865
to tell you what happened
and write it down,

07:11.999 --> 07:13.567
I can submit that as evidence.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.503
Wait. That'll fly?
Just my words?

07:15.603 --> 07:16.570
Yes.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.105
It's called a declaration.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.873
I can use it in lieu
of in-person testimony.

07:20.007 --> 07:23.243
On it. I will get you
that declaration.

07:23.376 --> 07:26.714
Uh, did you get a chance
to speak to Nancy yet?

07:26.847 --> 07:28.448
No.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.551
Okay, well, you know, as
your platanchor, best friend,

07:30.684 --> 07:33.086
and romance enthusiast,
I'm required to ask.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.455
George and Nick just broke up.

07:35.589 --> 07:38.358
I feel like the energy in
the friend group's a little off.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.793
I don't need
to rock the boat right now.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.261
Yeah, well, we have, uh,

07:41.394 --> 07:42.730
almost all died together
multiple times,

07:42.863 --> 07:43.964
so I think the friend
group can sustain.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.099
I saw Nancy and Park making out

07:46.233 --> 07:47.935
at the historical society.

07:48.068 --> 07:51.204
What? So you're afraid
of a little competition?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.206
Park is an Ivy League grad.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.543
He was one of the youngest
in his class at Quantico.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.211
He speaks eight languages.
I only speak three languages.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.880
Well, it's good
that, you know,

07:59.980 --> 08:03.283
there's no language
requirement to date Nancy.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.819
I wash dishes for a living,

08:05.953 --> 08:08.255
sleeping on Nick's couch.
I got that going for me.

08:08.388 --> 08:12.292
Yeah, Ace, that
really doesn't matter.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.461
If we got the soul-splitter back

08:14.595 --> 08:16.163
from Temperance,
do you think you could

08:16.296 --> 08:18.632
separate out Charity's soul
from the next Copperhead victim?

08:18.766 --> 08:20.934
(laughing):
Okay, now you're
changing the subject.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.335
No, I'm serious.
We're gonna need a way

08:22.469 --> 08:24.237
to get Charity's soul
out of the victim,

08:24.337 --> 08:25.606
ideally without harming them,

08:25.739 --> 08:27.074
and you've already
used the soul-splitter

08:27.174 --> 08:29.309
on George and Odette.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.813
Yeah, but I...
but I lost Odette.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.749
I don't... I don't know
if there's a way of doing it

08:35.849 --> 08:38.185
without either
destroying Charity

08:38.318 --> 08:40.654
or her unfortunate host.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.595
Ugh. This light is brutal.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.262
You feel that?

08:49.362 --> 08:50.964
Did I miss an
earthquake again?

08:51.098 --> 08:52.966
It's the raw energy
of our voices coming together

08:53.100 --> 08:55.035
to enact justice.
(chuckles)

08:55.168 --> 08:57.104
The sweet smell of civic duty.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.773
I think that's disinfectant.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.776
I hope we get a murder.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.551
(elevator bell dings)

09:17.891 --> 09:19.793
It's Gettysburg.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.995
Uh, excuse me?

09:22.129 --> 09:24.131
Did-did... did
someone drop this?
Keep it moving.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.833
I just... I just...
I just really need

09:25.966 --> 09:27.234
to find out who this belongs to.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.402
Ask later.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.173
(phone buzzes)

09:34.207 --> 09:36.509
You finished jury duty already?
NICK:
No.

09:36.644 --> 09:37.911
I think the Copperhead's
next victim is

09:38.045 --> 09:39.680
in the courthouse with me
right now.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.682
Wait. You found the next victim?

09:41.815 --> 09:43.751
Uh, what are you gonna do?

09:43.884 --> 09:46.319
Let's go!

09:46.419 --> 09:49.022
I'm gonna get on that jury.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.358
*

10:05.839 --> 10:07.540
It was a gift
to Everett from the pope.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.342
Yeah, the pope needs
better friends.
(chuckles)

10:09.442 --> 10:13.714
Hey, this is, um,
some of Celia's jewelry.

10:13.847 --> 10:17.250
She'd want you to have it,
so just take whatever you like.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.194
Wow. It's heavy.
(laughs softly)

10:27.294 --> 10:31.431
So I got a job interview
for a consulting firm.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.234
I-It would be the first time
that I ever worked for somebody

10:34.367 --> 10:37.204
whose last name
isn't "Hudson," so...

10:37.304 --> 10:39.206
fresh start, here I come.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.441
Congrats. You deserve it.

10:41.574 --> 10:44.144
Thank you.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.280
Ah.

10:47.414 --> 10:48.916
"CHD."

10:49.049 --> 10:51.719
It's Charity Hudson Dow.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.887
It's, uh, Temperance's
daughter.

10:56.623 --> 10:59.259
Man, I cannot imagine

10:59.392 --> 11:00.761
what it would be like
to lose a kid.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.130
I know. It gutted her.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.638
It's a letter

11:11.772 --> 11:13.640
from Charity to Cora Dow.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.009
That's Beckett's mom.

11:16.143 --> 11:19.079
"If my soul is able
to cross over,

11:19.179 --> 11:22.582
"resurrection at the hands
of my vengeful mother will lead

11:22.682 --> 11:26.486
"to a flood of
devastation without end.

11:26.619 --> 11:29.322
"She has shared with
me a wretched plan

11:29.456 --> 11:31.591
of which I desire no part."

11:35.162 --> 11:37.330
Charity didn't ask Beckett
to split her soul

11:37.464 --> 11:39.933
so they could
reunite in death.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.136
She did it to keep
her mother away forever.

11:44.872 --> 11:48.041
This's why Cora and the Women
in White set up the barrier

11:48.175 --> 11:50.677
outside Horseshoe Bay
to keep Temperance out.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.345
And then Beckett
became the Copperhead

11:52.479 --> 11:53.847
in case she ever
broke through.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.715
And the keepers of the
historical society got roped

11:55.849 --> 11:58.351
into it, too, just to protect
the town from Temperance.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.353
I fell for her story

12:00.487 --> 12:02.389
about being a grieving mother

12:02.522 --> 12:04.657
who just wanted to
reconnect with her daughter.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.794
I'm such an idiot.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.829
There's no way

12:08.962 --> 12:11.865
that she's gonna get the last
two pieces of Charity's soul.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.968
Have you ever had
your car broken into?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.503
No, ma'am.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.505
Have you ever been
the victim of a crime?

12:18.638 --> 12:22.475
The victim?
Um, uh, no, I have not.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.477
Mr. Nickerson, I'm aware
that you work at the Claw

12:24.577 --> 12:26.479
with the defense attorney's
daughter Nancy.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.081
I assume that you know

12:28.215 --> 12:29.749
Mr. Drew, as well?

12:29.883 --> 12:32.552
Yes. But I understand the law

12:32.685 --> 12:34.554
and can apply it with merit,

12:34.687 --> 12:37.090
regardless
of personal relationships.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.528
Counselor?

12:41.661 --> 12:44.264
CARSON:
Mr. Nickerson,

12:44.397 --> 12:47.434
you believe you are able
to be fair and impartial?

12:47.567 --> 12:50.070
Yes, absolutely, sir.
Thank you very much.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.007
Good morning.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.009
Have a few
questions for you.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.611
Do you understand the burden of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt,

12:58.745 --> 13:00.848
and do you think that
you can apply that law?

13:00.948 --> 13:03.516
GEORGE:
I'm here
about your friend Peter.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.385
Sorry. I'm slammed right now.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.021
All you have to do is tell me
if he was here.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.622
I don't want to get involved.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.591
Look, I know this might be
inconvenient for you,

13:11.724 --> 13:13.193
but Peter could literally
go to jail

13:13.293 --> 13:14.761
for something
that he did not do.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.930
Was he here or not?

13:19.299 --> 13:21.134
Fine.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.405
(whispering):
Come on, come on.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.925
Are these leftovers
all from the restaurant?

13:45.058 --> 13:47.660
Sometimes they order too much.

13:47.794 --> 13:50.230
Our boss tells us to toss it,
but I can't do that

13:50.330 --> 13:52.399
knowing
there are hungry kids out there.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.003
Like Peter.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.770
He's not the only one.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.908
So he was here that day,
picking up food.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.143
Hey,

14:03.276 --> 14:04.677
I get it.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.446
If it weren't
for Claw leftovers,

14:06.579 --> 14:08.681
my family would've skipped
a lot of dinners.

14:08.815 --> 14:11.118
So you understand why
I can't say anything.

14:11.251 --> 14:14.354
There are rules. The restaurant
could get shut down.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.523
Too many people count
on this food.

14:18.158 --> 14:21.161
Don't worry. I got you.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.464
JEAN:
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

14:24.597 --> 14:26.666
we have an eyewitness
who saw the defendant

14:26.799 --> 14:29.536
break into a car
and steal the laptop.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.538
This same laptop was
later found discarded

14:31.671 --> 14:35.976
in an alley next to a young man
who is currently in a coma.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.845
The defendant stole the laptop
with the intent to sell.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.480
The sale went poorly,

14:40.613 --> 14:43.850
setting in motion
a tragic chain of events.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.186
The defense is going
to tell you a sob story

14:46.319 --> 14:50.490
about how the defendant
has a bright future.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.026
Don't be swayed
by emotional manipulation.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.628
Peter Tombar is

14:55.728 --> 14:57.564
a repeat offender,

14:57.697 --> 15:01.334
and he is causing chaos
in our streets.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.341
CARSON:
To be clear,

15:08.475 --> 15:13.046
my client has not been charged
with any act of violence.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.016
Don't be confused by the D.A.'s
unfounded insinuations.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.584
This case

15:17.717 --> 15:21.188
is one on a docket
of 142 for her.

15:21.321 --> 15:24.524
The prosecution
is creating a fiction

15:24.657 --> 15:28.195
to make up for the fact that
they have no hard evidence,

15:28.328 --> 15:30.230
which leaves plenty of room

15:30.363 --> 15:32.399
for reasonable doubt.

15:32.532 --> 15:35.402
Counsel,
please approach the bench.

15:38.105 --> 15:41.208
Nice try framing my humanity
as emotional manipulation.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.210
Well, nice try
undercutting my work ethic.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.911
Cheap and ineffective.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.513
Cheap is trying
to tie my client

15:46.613 --> 15:48.381
to an assault
he has no connection to.
Oh.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.017
Are you two in a relationship?

15:50.117 --> 15:52.185
My clerk saw

15:52.285 --> 15:54.354
a new post
from @HorseshoeBaes

15:54.454 --> 15:56.623
that says you two are dating.

15:56.756 --> 16:00.527
You're practically having
a lover's quarrel out there.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.429
Whatever our personal
relationship is,

16:02.562 --> 16:04.431
I can assure you
it has no bearing

16:04.564 --> 16:07.034
in this courtroom,
Your Honor.
None whatsoever.

16:07.134 --> 16:11.238
This post has 746 likes
and several sub-posts.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.073
A lot of people have opinions

16:13.206 --> 16:15.608
about the D.A. dating
a defense attorney.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.645
I don't want this case to be
influenced by outside gossip.

16:18.778 --> 16:23.283
Out of extreme caution,
I'm sequestering the jury.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.986
(gallery murmuring)

16:27.120 --> 16:28.588
Maybe it isn't
such a good idea

16:28.721 --> 16:30.257
for us to go
away right now.

16:30.390 --> 16:33.293
I could not agree
with you more.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.762
(whispering):
Carson? Here.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.273
Your Honor,
may I request a brief recess?

16:46.406 --> 16:48.341
Five minutes.

16:48.475 --> 16:51.311
(gavel bangs)

16:53.746 --> 16:56.483
I would have kept your secret
about the restaurant safe.

16:56.616 --> 17:00.087
I didn't beat up the guy
they found with the laptop.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.622
I knew him, but I-I-I
didn't touch him.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.924
Don't worry. That's not
what you're on trial for here.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.627
The truth is, their star witness
is a security guard

17:07.760 --> 17:10.029
with no real proof
that he saw you.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.765
All he has is a story,
which we can unwind.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.767
I can do some digging.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.105
Always happy to have
an extra set of eyes.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.809
Temperance is using
Charity's soul

17:22.942 --> 17:25.278
to unleash a flood
of devastation.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.514
Take it you are no longer
Team Temperance.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.682
Hard no.
Park's team is keeping an eye

17:29.816 --> 17:32.018
on her at Stonerock Manor
in New York.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.786
We have no idea
when she'll be back,

17:33.886 --> 17:35.788
but it should buy us some time,
at least,

17:35.888 --> 17:37.790
while we look for
the Copperhead's next victim.
(phone chimes)

17:37.890 --> 17:40.360
(phone chimes)
(sighs)

17:40.493 --> 17:43.630
Breaking news! "Carson Drew,
top lawyer in town,

17:43.730 --> 17:45.398
is in a relationship
with D.A. Jean Rosario."

17:45.532 --> 17:47.167
Okay, well, since when
does social media care

17:47.300 --> 17:49.636
about Carson's love life?
Yeah, I leaked that.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.404
Nick asked me
for a favor.

17:51.538 --> 17:52.839
He was looking for a way
to get sequestered.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.641
I had to think fast.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.177
Okay, he thinks the next victim
is on the jury with him.

17:58.645 --> 18:02.649
The piece of Charity's soul
inside Jake began to awaken

18:02.749 --> 18:05.152
and show symptoms
as soon as Matthew died.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.753
Whoever that person is,

18:06.886 --> 18:09.055
they should be
exhibiting symptoms right now.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.029
Jury duty
sure is draining, huh?

18:17.164 --> 18:19.332
I'm legit a zombie right now.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.701
I was teaching
Smash Up at 5:00 a.m.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.237
At the community
fitness center?

18:24.371 --> 18:26.939
It's cardio boxing.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.775
NICK:
Oh, uh,

18:28.908 --> 18:31.378
got a favorite
passage in there?

18:31.511 --> 18:33.446
Revelation 1:8.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.947
"I am Alpha and Omega,

18:35.081 --> 18:36.749
"the beginning and the ending,
saith the Lord,

18:36.883 --> 18:39.386
which is, and which was, and
which is to come, the Almighty."

18:39.519 --> 18:41.921
God is totally a woman.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.224
Didn't he steal
Ryan Hudson's baby?

18:44.357 --> 18:46.459
Oh. Oh, no. I wouldn't
say it like that.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.228
Ryan Hudson is fine.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.198
The day he followed me on Insta,
I was dead, just obsessed.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.865
Ugh. I want my phone.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.369
Hey, have you had any...
weird dreams lately?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.905
Perhaps about war?
Yeah, actually.

18:59.038 --> 19:00.640
I chalked it up
to too many late nights

19:00.773 --> 19:02.642
playing Call of Duty
with my roommates.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.645
Wait. Why do you care
about my life?

19:05.778 --> 19:08.114
Are you hitting on me?
At jury duty?

19:08.248 --> 19:09.782
Not interested.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.285
No. I...

19:12.419 --> 19:14.787
I am.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.430
Hey! Hey, George!

19:23.563 --> 19:24.831
Move along.

19:24.964 --> 19:28.835
Let's, uh... let's
grab lunch sometime.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.938
GEROGE:
Why didn't anyone tell me

19:32.071 --> 19:33.773
that Nick was
on Carson's trial?

19:33.906 --> 19:36.843
He gave me the weirdest look.
I hate this.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.445
Yeah, something is weird.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.146
We just got a phone call
from the court officer

19:40.280 --> 19:41.681
assigned to Nick's jury.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.183
She placed a huge
lunch order at the Claw.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.320
Nick asked for Bolognese.
He knows we don't serve that.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.155
And he sent credit card info.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.291
I mean, doesn't the court pay
for the lunch?

19:51.424 --> 19:52.925
It was a code.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.596
"Let's get lunch."
It was a signal.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.665
He knew I would understand.

19:58.798 --> 20:03.770
"Daniela teach. HBCFC."

20:03.870 --> 20:07.173
Nick is remarkably
level-headed under pressure.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.777
BESS:
Daniela Pino. She teaches

20:10.877 --> 20:13.280
Speed Freak, Shred Tread
and Smash Up.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.316
She sounds fun.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.619
Order Nick a tuna melt.
I got to go.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.059
(horn honking)
Whoa!

20:28.194 --> 20:29.962
Are you kidding?

20:30.062 --> 20:33.032
Okay. What are you gonna do?

20:33.165 --> 20:35.034
Hey, you!

20:35.167 --> 20:37.236
Yes?
What are you doing?

20:37.370 --> 20:39.906
Um, nothing.
I-I didn't see the car.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.474
I asked what you were doing.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.876
I was Walking,
and now I'm walking away.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.846
Let me see your bag.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.715
Excuse me?

20:48.848 --> 20:51.584
There have been instances of
theft around here recently.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.986
Yo, don't touch me!

20:54.086 --> 20:56.856
Good afternoon, Ms. MacCorkle.
Can I help you with those?

20:57.857 --> 21:00.159
How was your
day today?

21:00.259 --> 21:02.329
Daniela is a match.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.331
Her ancestor

21:04.431 --> 21:06.399
fought for the Union Army
in the Civil War,

21:06.533 --> 21:09.068
and her grandmother lived
to be 101.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.270
Park's guys are running the
name, too, just to double-check.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.540
Awesome.
BESS:
Okay.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.207
So, how are we gonna
protect Daniela?
Well,

21:15.342 --> 21:17.009
the Copperhead targets people
with Charity's soul.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.545
It's able
to identify them somehow.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.012
Well, you're the only one of us

21:20.112 --> 21:21.381
who's seen the bloody thing
up close.

21:21.514 --> 21:24.216
What do you remember?

21:25.952 --> 21:28.287
It could sense
I had Charity's doll.

21:28.421 --> 21:31.090
Almost like it was using that
as a guide to find me.

21:31.223 --> 21:33.292
Like a bloodhound
sniffing a scent?
The doll

21:33.426 --> 21:36.729
could have created an
odor image. Yeah. Maybe

21:36.863 --> 21:39.198
the Copperhead's using that
to find her soul.
BESS: Right.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.568
Okay, so if it knows
what Charity smells like,

21:41.701 --> 21:44.270
it must be able to detect
the scent of the host, too.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.473
Maybe we throw the Copperhead
off the Daniela trail

21:46.606 --> 21:48.375
by spreading her scent
around town.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.142
We just need some
personal effects of Daniela's.

21:50.276 --> 21:51.578
Okay.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.813
Um, and what about Temperance?

21:53.946 --> 21:55.314
If Temperance knew
where Charity's soul was,

21:55.448 --> 21:56.816
she would have all the pieces
already.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.285
She's trying
to figure it out, same as us.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.754
We just have
to beat her to the punch.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.062
As I crossed the lot, I saw
a man emerging from a Ferrari.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.564
I chased him
as far as I could,

22:11.664 --> 22:14.100
but I couldn't leave the lot
unattended.

22:14.233 --> 22:16.168
Thank you. And is the man
you saw running away

22:16.302 --> 22:17.604
in the courtroom right now?

22:17.737 --> 22:19.238
He sure is.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.574
In the green shirt.
JEAN:
Thank you.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.511
No further questions,
Your Honor.

22:24.644 --> 22:27.079
JUDGE:
We'll resume
cross-examination

22:27.179 --> 22:29.015
after a five-minute recess.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.450
(gavel bangs)

22:30.583 --> 22:31.951
GEORGE:
The whole time,

22:32.084 --> 22:33.953
that security guard
was giving me side-eye.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.789
And for literally no reason,
he demanded he sees my bag.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.991
But then a fancy lady walks by,
and he's all,

22:39.125 --> 22:40.827
"Oh, let me get the door
for you."

22:40.960 --> 22:42.462
Was he perhaps profiling you

22:42.595 --> 22:44.363
because he saw you spying
on him?
No.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.098
He was just being a dick.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.967
There's absolutely no way
that guy saw me spying on him.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.802
What makes you
say that?

22:49.936 --> 22:51.203
He was wearing sunglasses, and
he jumped when I approached,

22:51.337 --> 22:52.872
like he didn't see me coming.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.807
You know, Victoria used
to wear sunglasses

22:54.941 --> 22:57.143
when she was hungover
and sleeping in public.

23:02.314 --> 23:05.384
Defendant's exhibit one is
a photo taken the day

23:05.518 --> 23:07.520
of the alleged crime.

23:07.654 --> 23:13.125
Randall, what are you wearing
on your eyes in that photo?

23:13.225 --> 23:14.794
Sunglasses?

23:14.894 --> 23:16.829
The same sunglasses
on your collar?

23:17.830 --> 23:19.566
Yeah.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.734
Would you put those on for us?

23:35.381 --> 23:38.050
What does the top line say?

23:40.386 --> 23:41.888
I...

23:42.021 --> 23:43.856
I can't read it.
Because

23:43.990 --> 23:47.426
you can't see without
your prescription glasses,

23:47.560 --> 23:49.762
which you did not have on
the day you accused my client

23:49.896 --> 23:51.197
of stealing the laptop.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.399
There's no way
you could have seen his face

23:53.533 --> 23:54.867
across that lot.
Objection!

23:55.001 --> 23:56.368
Calls for speculation.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.505
Withdrawn, Your Honor.

24:05.377 --> 24:08.447
Mm. Hey, Jake's co-worker said

24:08.581 --> 24:10.517
that he turned
the cafe temperature down

24:10.617 --> 24:12.585
to 58 degrees before he died.

24:12.719 --> 24:16.923
But Daniela's thermostat is set
at a balmy 70.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.091
(phone buzzes)

24:23.930 --> 24:26.799
Hmm. Kind of weird.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.935
Park's team searched
Daniela Pino multiple times,

24:29.068 --> 24:30.570
and didn't get any hits.

24:30.703 --> 24:33.740
Maybe Park's wrong.
(phone buzzes)

24:34.807 --> 24:36.776
What's he saying now?

24:36.909 --> 24:39.311
Oh, nothing.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.882
(Nancy sighs happily)

24:42.982 --> 24:45.384
So what's up with you two?
I don't know.

24:45.484 --> 24:49.321
We haven't put a label
on it yet, but...

24:49.455 --> 24:52.124
he surprised me in a good way.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.229
Daniela wasn't in Horseshoe Bay

24:57.329 --> 25:00.266
when Jake Cazine's death would
have triggered the curse.

25:00.399 --> 25:02.902
She was in Milwaukee
at her sister Jackie's wedding.

25:08.575 --> 25:10.643
Jackie's her older sister.

25:10.777 --> 25:11.811
But Charity's soul passed down

25:11.944 --> 25:13.512
generationally
to the firstborn.

25:13.646 --> 25:16.248
So, if Daniela has
an older sister,

25:16.348 --> 25:18.417
then she can't be the host.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.754
The victim is
a different juror.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.523
Your Honor, the prosecution
would like to offer

25:24.657 --> 25:26.192
into evidence the
cell phone records

25:26.325 --> 25:28.294
of Tony Wassell,
the man found comatose

25:28.427 --> 25:30.329
in the vicinity of
the stolen laptop.

25:30.462 --> 25:32.965
Hey.
We can still
save his leg, Doctor!

25:33.099 --> 25:34.466
JUDGE:
Juror number two,

25:34.601 --> 25:37.369
we're in the middle
of cross-examination.

25:37.503 --> 25:40.439
Stop talking now,
or I'll have you removed.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.975
Understood?
Uh-huh.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.816
(whispering):
You okay?

25:49.949 --> 25:52.384
I just had
the strangest nightmare.

25:52.518 --> 25:55.121
I was standing on the grass
in the middle of a battlefield.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.890
(exhales)

26:02.061 --> 26:03.963
(entry bell jingles)

26:04.063 --> 26:06.298
Park subpoenaed the list
of jury members.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.836
His team got a match with
the name "Lev J. Stern."

26:09.969 --> 26:11.337
Go, Park!

26:11.470 --> 26:13.673
There's no residence,
though, only a P.O. box.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.141
Lev lives
off the grid.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.843
Well, it's almost the end
of the day.

26:16.976 --> 26:19.646
The jury's gonna be heading to
a hotel for sequestering soon.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.247
Right. We just have to figure
out which one they'll be at.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.649
CARSON:
Your Honor,

26:22.749 --> 26:24.884
a vague text exchange

26:25.017 --> 26:27.419
in no way proves that my client
is guilty of stealing a laptop.

26:27.553 --> 26:30.156
(crying):
My love, I shall always
be with you.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.692
My love, I shall
always be with you.
Juror number two,

26:32.825 --> 26:34.226
since you can't follow the
rules of the courtroom,

26:34.360 --> 26:35.728
I shall always be with you.
I'll always be with you.

26:35.862 --> 26:36.863
...I deem you unfit
to serve on this jury.

26:36.996 --> 26:39.198
You are excused!
(Lev gasps)

26:50.710 --> 26:52.111
(door opens, closes)

26:52.244 --> 26:54.246
Oh.

26:54.380 --> 26:58.450
Okay, no cell phone,
no Internet,

26:58.584 --> 27:02.188
no... owl.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.090
What am I supposed to do?
Send a freaking smoke signal?

27:04.223 --> 27:07.059
(footsteps approaching,
knocking)

27:08.728 --> 27:11.063
Hi! We are

27:11.197 --> 27:13.365
so sorry about the
leak in your bathroom,

27:13.465 --> 27:15.267
so we set you up in Room 413,

27:15.401 --> 27:17.303
with the court's permission,
of course.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.305
Oh, why, thanks.

27:19.438 --> 27:22.441
I'll just, uh...
I'll grab my things.

27:25.244 --> 27:28.114
You know
this place is haunted, right?

27:34.887 --> 27:37.089
(sighs)

27:38.657 --> 27:40.326
Oh.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.228
Murder room
for the win.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.563
Hi.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.566
Okay, okay, so, uh, I was
wrong about Daniela being

27:47.666 --> 27:49.568
the Copperhead's
next target. It's, uh...

27:49.668 --> 27:52.304
Lev J. Stern. We know.
Do you know which room he's in?

27:52.438 --> 27:54.306
No. He had
a Copperhead-induced meltdown,

27:54.440 --> 27:56.075
got excused from the jury
and took off.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.144
He's not here.
Okay, so how are we gonna
find him?

27:58.277 --> 28:01.848
Oh, I might...

28:01.981 --> 28:04.016
have an idea.

28:07.286 --> 28:08.788
LEV:
So...

28:08.921 --> 28:10.957
I'm hosting one-fourth
of the soul of a woman

28:11.090 --> 28:12.992
who died
in the Battle of Gettysburg,

28:13.125 --> 28:16.528
and a supernatural entity is
trying to hunt me down?

28:16.662 --> 28:19.932
Yup, that about
sums it up.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.368
At least I have a reason
for why I've been so scattered.

28:22.501 --> 28:25.537
One moment, I'm myself,

28:25.671 --> 28:28.274
and others, I'm not.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.810
I'm sorry. I know how
much that must suck.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.278
Yeah. I've always believed

28:32.378 --> 28:34.313
that there was something more
out there

28:34.446 --> 28:36.315
than what we've been told.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.184
And I don't fear death.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.953
No one's gonna die
on our watch.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.790
Uh, Lev, we think
we might have

28:43.890 --> 28:46.058
a plan to keep you safe.
(quietly):
Hey, um...

28:46.192 --> 28:47.726
But we're gonna need
access to your room,

28:47.860 --> 28:50.329
and some of your stuff,
if that's okay.

28:50.462 --> 28:54.466
Uh, I looked at the
coroner's reports again.
Mm-hmm.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.969
Jake and Matthew both
wore wristwatches

28:57.069 --> 28:59.171
that were frozen at
the exact same time--

28:59.305 --> 29:00.639
11:57 p.m.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.408
It's their recorded
time of death.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.476
That's the darkest part
of the night.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.346
And Matthew Burke wrote
about the Great Darkness

29:07.479 --> 29:09.015
in his journal.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.050
We have two hours
until 11:57.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.684
Our-our plan can still work.

29:12.819 --> 29:15.487
Each of us just
gathers Lev's scent

29:15.587 --> 29:19.191
and we spread it around as far
as we can as fast as we can.

29:20.192 --> 29:22.761
Hmm.

29:53.259 --> 29:56.095
(breath quivering)

30:00.632 --> 30:02.634
(lights clack off)

30:03.903 --> 30:07.073
(door opens, creaks)

30:09.708 --> 30:12.278
(heavy footsteps approaching)

30:12.411 --> 30:14.446
(low growling)

30:14.580 --> 30:16.615
(metallic scratching)

30:22.088 --> 30:24.123
(low growling)

30:30.796 --> 30:33.232
(low growling continues)

30:33.332 --> 30:35.601
(metal clattering,
glass breaking)

30:39.405 --> 30:41.440
(low growling)

30:53.953 --> 30:56.788
(low growling)

31:06.698 --> 31:09.468
(inhales quietly)

31:12.804 --> 31:14.873
(soft growling)

31:19.778 --> 31:21.313
(low growling continues)

31:21.447 --> 31:23.782
(door opens, closes)

31:23.882 --> 31:25.985
(exhales) Oh.

31:26.118 --> 31:29.655
Hey. Lev, it's us.
We're just checking in.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.027
(door creaks)

31:36.862 --> 31:38.630
He's gone.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.044
Lev? Lev?!

31:58.150 --> 32:02.021
(Lev hums "The Battle Hymn
of the Republic")

32:03.389 --> 32:05.324
Looks like
he's in some kind of trance.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.359
Lev?

32:07.493 --> 32:09.595
Lev? Can you hear me?

32:11.897 --> 32:12.831
(groans)

32:12.931 --> 32:14.433
(Bess gasps)

32:14.566 --> 32:16.035
(groaning)
Come on.

32:16.168 --> 32:17.403
Oh, my God.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.605
Okay, I have an idea
to break his trance.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.507
A protection
ritual, modified.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.409
Okay.

32:27.946 --> 32:31.017
Where am I?

32:31.117 --> 32:32.784
What's going on?

32:32.918 --> 32:34.953
Run!

32:42.128 --> 32:43.762
What?

32:43.895 --> 32:46.065
It's 11:58 p.m.

32:46.198 --> 32:50.436
(low growling)

32:52.438 --> 32:55.874
(eerie whooshing)

33:03.149 --> 33:06.052
11 guilty,

33:06.152 --> 33:07.819
one not.

33:07.953 --> 33:09.388
(scoffs)

33:09.488 --> 33:11.323
I just think
we should go over the evidence

33:11.457 --> 33:13.759
before we potentially
send a kid to jail.

33:13.892 --> 33:16.728
He stole because he's poor.
What more evidence do you need?

33:16.828 --> 33:19.565
Plus, why can't
anyone alibi him?
Yeah.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.101
He has no friends? No family?

33:22.234 --> 33:24.503
I know his family.
Mom ran off with the neighbor.

33:24.636 --> 33:27.005
And his dad fixed the roof of my
uncle's house a few years ago,

33:27.139 --> 33:30.242
asked for payment up front,
did a crap job and dipped.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.778
See? If the family's no good,
the kid's no good.

33:32.911 --> 33:34.913
Okay.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.948
Can I ask?
What's your family like?
Great.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.950
My parents
are doctors.
Oh.

33:39.085 --> 33:41.253
Lucky you.
Are you a doctor, too?
No.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.455
I run a nail salon.
So,

33:43.589 --> 33:45.624
growing up, did people ask you

33:45.757 --> 33:47.359
if you were gonna be a doctor
like Mom and Dad?

33:47.493 --> 33:49.595
All the time.
It was annoying. Why?

33:49.695 --> 33:51.930
If you didn't like being judged
based on your parents,

33:52.030 --> 33:53.999
why would you do that to Peter?

33:54.133 --> 33:55.767
JUROR SEVEN:
Okay, fine.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.769
What about the kid they
found next to the laptop?

33:57.869 --> 33:59.538
The one who's
been in a coma?

33:59.671 --> 34:01.640
He's got nothing
to do with this case.
Yes, he does.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.675
Peter stole the laptop
to sell to the kid,

34:03.809 --> 34:05.344
then beat the kid up
when the deal went bad,

34:05.477 --> 34:07.045
left him for dead
in an alley.

34:07.179 --> 34:08.814
That is not what he's being
charged with,

34:08.947 --> 34:12.484
and there is zero proof that
Peter was ever with that kid.

34:12.618 --> 34:13.885
But they exchanged
text messages

34:14.019 --> 34:15.521
about a payment,
so it's possible.

34:15.654 --> 34:18.724
Possible assumes
reasonable doubt.

34:18.857 --> 34:21.727
Peter was arrested
before, for stealing.
True.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.995
But this is a separate case.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.831
Horseshoe Bay used
to be a nice place.

34:25.964 --> 34:28.134
Now there's three men
with their hearts ripped out.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.236
We can't take chances.

34:30.369 --> 34:31.970
The safety
of the town is at stake.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.240
Why do you care so much, anyway?

34:34.373 --> 34:36.675
Kid pays a fine,
does time, whatever.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.177
He's no saint.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.711
Maybe this shakes him up.

34:39.845 --> 34:43.081
It's not on us to shake him up.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.587
Our job is
to look at the facts.

34:49.888 --> 34:53.525
And...
and if we were better people,

34:53.659 --> 34:55.427
we'd be talking
about how messed up it is

34:55.561 --> 34:57.529
that we care more
about this laptop

34:57.663 --> 34:59.898
than the kids struggling
in our community.
DANIELA: I'm tired of

35:00.031 --> 35:02.434
having to feel sorry for people
who can't get it together.

35:02.568 --> 35:05.237
I was kicked out of my house
at 16. I figured it out.

35:05.371 --> 35:08.240
Well, maybe
Peter's trying to figure it out.

35:08.374 --> 35:11.777
And he happened to be in the
wrong place at the wrong time,

35:11.910 --> 35:14.546
and now this sets him back,
we set him back.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.048
And not, not because
of hard evidence, but...

35:18.717 --> 35:21.086
Not because

35:21.220 --> 35:25.457
of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.361
But because of our opinions.

35:32.063 --> 35:33.365
(scoffs)

35:33.465 --> 35:37.102
Because...
we feel a certain way.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.612
Should we take another vote?

35:57.289 --> 35:58.390
JUDGE:
Members of the jury,

35:58.490 --> 36:00.559
have you reached a verdict?

36:02.628 --> 36:04.496
We, the jury,

36:04.630 --> 36:08.133
find the defendant
as to count one, grand theft...

36:08.267 --> 36:11.403
not guilty.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.672
Oh.

36:13.805 --> 36:16.342
(quietly):
Yes.

36:23.282 --> 36:25.851
Oh. Yes.
Oh, my God.

36:25.984 --> 36:29.788
* Dazed and hazy,
lost my way through the maze *

36:29.921 --> 36:31.790
* Just I don't care,
I don't care... *

36:31.923 --> 36:35.661
George, thank you
for your help.

36:35.794 --> 36:38.364
You were a rock star.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.799
Yeah, it was actually fun.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.802
Being a lawyer was always a pipe
dream of mine when I was a kid.

36:43.935 --> 36:46.672
Victoria always said
I was great at arguing.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.274
Well, why didn't you pursue it?

36:48.374 --> 36:49.975
I could never afford
law school.

36:50.108 --> 36:52.110
And I suck at test-taking.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.446
I failed the bar
my first time out.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.049
Don't sell yourself short.

36:59.985 --> 37:01.620
All right.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.956
Well, if you need help again,
I'll be around.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.459
Good to know.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.633
Tony Wassell woke up.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.702
He ID'd his attacker.

37:16.835 --> 37:19.405
It wasn't Peter.
Hmm.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.873
Can't say I'm surprised.

37:22.007 --> 37:24.009
I was sure
the two were connected.

37:24.142 --> 37:26.345
You were doing your job.

37:26.478 --> 37:29.047
They say "fair and impartial,"

37:29.180 --> 37:31.583
but it's impossible
to be impartial.

37:31.717 --> 37:33.652
We're human.

37:33.752 --> 37:37.222
The people of Horseshoe Bay
don't know how lucky they are

37:37.356 --> 37:38.857
to have you looking out
for them.

37:40.726 --> 37:42.828
Also, my sister's cabin

37:42.928 --> 37:45.831
in Winter Harbor is available
this weekend

37:45.931 --> 37:48.767
if you're still around.

37:48.900 --> 37:52.404
I just might be.

37:52.538 --> 37:54.773
BESS:
Hey.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.175
You're not gonna
tell her, are you?

37:57.275 --> 37:59.177
The last time I tried,

37:59.277 --> 38:01.179
I got sucked
into a liminal space,

38:01.279 --> 38:03.915
and she hooked up with Park.
I think that's a sign.

38:04.049 --> 38:06.585
I know signs.
That is not a sign.

38:06.718 --> 38:09.921
Park isn't the problem, okay?
The problem is you.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.791
You-you're afraid the idea will
be better than the thing itself.

38:12.924 --> 38:15.361
It would change everything.
So?

38:15.461 --> 38:20.231
Yeah, love is-is painful
and messy and stupid,

38:20.366 --> 38:25.404
but it-it's also beautiful
and perfect and worth it.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.377
(sighs)

38:33.779 --> 38:36.915
Park arranged a police
surveillance detail for Lev

38:37.048 --> 38:38.917
and an escort
for protection during the day

38:39.050 --> 38:40.486
till we figure out a plan.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.888
On the plus side,
Lev still seems pretty Zen.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.591
(exhales loudly)

38:45.724 --> 38:48.394
Or he's disassociating.
Hey, Lev?

38:48.494 --> 38:51.229
How you doing, buddy?

38:51.329 --> 38:54.766
Honestly, I feel grateful to be
a vessel for Charity's soul.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.969
When I was under
the Copperhead's trance,

38:58.103 --> 39:01.740
I actually felt the pull
of its love for her.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.610
What a gift to experience that,
if only briefly.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.745
(knocking)

39:06.845 --> 39:09.981
Hi.

39:10.115 --> 39:13.452
Lev, HBPD is here
for your protection.

39:13.585 --> 39:15.954
So, keep your phone
on you, and we'll...

39:16.087 --> 39:18.757
We'll be in contact soon, okay?

39:19.758 --> 39:21.192
Whenever you're ready.

39:21.326 --> 39:23.695
(garbled radio transmission)
Thank you.

39:24.696 --> 39:28.767
Well, I don't know about
you guys, but I am starving.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.637
Regroup at the Claw?
Yeah, I'm just gonna
grab my bag.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.444
Can I talk to you
for a second?

39:38.544 --> 39:40.612
Yeah.

39:48.454 --> 39:51.189
You look like you're about
to tell me my dog just died.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.194
I have feelings for you.

39:57.195 --> 40:00.298
I've had feelings for
you for a long time.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.470
Seeing you with Park made me
realize I've...

40:04.570 --> 40:06.037
(sighs)

40:06.171 --> 40:08.474
I've been an idiot
for not saying something sooner.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.077
I know that
you guys are together now,

40:12.210 --> 40:15.080
and it's probably too late, but
I-I just needed to tell you.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.752
So I told you.

40:20.886 --> 40:23.755
I don't know what to say.
(door opens)

40:23.889 --> 40:28.694
Hey, something really weird just
happened at the estate auction.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.496
You guys are never
gonna believe this.

40:30.596 --> 40:32.063
Oh, hey. What's up, Ace?
Hey.

40:32.197 --> 40:33.599
So you know the stuff
that belongs

40:33.732 --> 40:35.100
to-to Charity-- this medic kit

40:35.233 --> 40:37.235
and all?
I'm gonna go.

40:37.368 --> 40:39.104
Yeah, okay.
Later, dude.
ACE: Bye.

40:39.237 --> 40:41.673
So, this kit just
drew the highest bid.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.709
Some anonymous donor
offered a ton of money

40:43.842 --> 40:46.211
for Charity's belongings, which
I thought was weird, right?

40:46.344 --> 40:47.879
'Cause of the whole
Temperance-Charity beef.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.515
So, I took it all back.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.416
You know, I didn't
let anyone buy it.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.785
Yeah, good looking out.
Right? Thanks.
You're welcome.

40:53.919 --> 40:56.187
Um, but then, as I was leaving,

40:56.287 --> 40:59.257
the auctioneer handed me this,

40:59.390 --> 41:01.760
said it was for you.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.863
Temperance.

41:05.597 --> 41:09.100
The hanged man
is the card of sacrifice.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.136
So who's the sacrifice?

41:13.805 --> 41:16.474
