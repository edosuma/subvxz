Mr. Lantz!
[ Screaming Continues ]

17:37.700 --> 17:40.933
Help! Mr. Lantz!
Help!

[ Screaming Continues ]

17:43.500 --> 17:46.367
Stop! Mr. Lantz!

Stop!
[ Echoing ]

[ Knocking At Door ]

17:51.867 --> 17:54.500
Dave, wake up
or you'll be late for school.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.067
Oh, did you sleep
in your clothes again?

18:00.067 --> 18:02.067
[ Door Closes ]

18:06.467 --> 18:09.633
Man, that was a bad dream.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.400
[ Tapping On Wall ]

18:21.400 --> 18:23.733
It must have been a dream.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.733
What's going on here?

18:35.733 --> 18:38.767
It's called breakfast,
in case you forgot.

18:40.767 --> 18:42.267
Huh?

18:43.067 --> 18:45.833
Hey, don't be a pig! That's more
than I get in a whole week.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.500
Andrea's right, Dave. This is
no time to start changing rations.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.467
You put some of that back.

18:59.433 --> 19:01.433
What the--

19:04.300 --> 19:06.200
Are you okay?

19:06.200 --> 19:10.433
Yeah, I'm fine. I just didn't
get much sleep last night.

19:10.433 --> 19:12.333
Had the weirdest dream.

19:12.333 --> 19:15.200
[ Beeping ]

19:15.200 --> 19:16.300
I'll get the shovel.

19:16.300 --> 19:19.933
Don't just stand there, Dave!
Go on! Go get some buckets!

Come on, David! Hurry up!

19:31.833 --> 19:35.333
- Let go!
- [ Chattering ]

19:35.333 --> 19:37.333
- It's mine!
- Give it to me!

19:37.833 --> 19:39.333
Ben!

19:39.333 --> 19:43.367
Oh, hey, Dave. Catch you later.
I'm kinda busy right now.

[ Roaring ]

19:53.667 --> 19:56.300
- I know what you're thinking.
- Mr. Lantz!

19:56.300 --> 20:00.067
You're thinking if things had been
maybe just a little bit different,

20:00.067 --> 20:03.200
we'd be the dominant
species instead of them.

20:04.267 --> 20:05.233
I dreamt
that things were different,

20:05.733 --> 20:08.867
and ants were so small you could
fit a thousand of them in one hand.

20:09.367 --> 20:11.867
- And it was your job to kill them.
- [ Laughing ]

20:11.867 --> 20:14.633
Don't let them
hear you say that.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.500
It seemed so real,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.867
I started to believe it myself.

20:20.867 --> 20:24.867
Better gather some food
before it's all gone.
