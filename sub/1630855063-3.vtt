WEBVTT

01:12.614 --> 01:14.575
<i>Folks, we're starting
our initial descent into Austin,</i>

01:14.575 --> 01:16.910
<i>so we're gonna ask you to return
to your seats now.</i>

01:17.411 --> 01:19.955
<i>We should have you on the ground
in about 15 minutes.</i>

01:21.206 --> 01:22.040
<i>You okay?</i>

01:23.250 --> 01:25.043
<i>You sure this is a good idea?</i>

01:33.135 --> 01:34.636
Here you go, Bailey.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.096
One for you, Suz.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.639
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.767
We could have shared popcorn.
Two is so extra.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.820
- You okay?
- Apparently, I'm extra.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.199
I've been extra eight
or nine times this week.

01:55.199 --> 01:57.743
I'm starting
to think of it as a compliment.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.330
You sure this is a good idea?

02:02.539 --> 02:05.334
<i>Yeah. I'm pretty sure.</i>

02:06.001 --> 02:08.878
I mean, separating what they want
from what you want

02:08.878 --> 02:13.050
from what's actually best for them
makes for a lot of tricky decisions.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.511
You weren't one of them.

02:15.511 --> 02:17.012
I find that hard to believe.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.890
Yeah, it's 'cause I know
something you don't know.

02:20.432 --> 02:21.558
Oh, yeah? What's that?

02:22.518 --> 02:25.646
You are absolutely gonna be
what's best for her.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.236
And, you know, me.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.154
Do you want my jacket?

03:16.947 --> 03:17.948
No.

03:19.908 --> 03:20.909
Thanks.

03:24.496 --> 03:25.914
Jesus.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.710
We're gonna figure this out.

03:30.752 --> 03:31.753
Uh-huh.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.801
I was thinking we should start
at the stadium.

03:37.801 --> 03:41.597
- What?
- I've been researching childhood memories.

03:41.597 --> 03:42.806
Okay.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.975
And it seems that if we go
to the stadium, it might--

03:46.059 --> 03:48.520
You might be able
to remember more details.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.565
You get this from one of your hippie
woodworking clients?

03:51.565 --> 03:56.612
It's wood turning, and this is
a real thing. I read about it in Psych--

03:56.612 --> 03:59.781
Please tell me this whole adventure
doesn't hinge on me

03:59.781 --> 04:02.284
remembering stuff from, like,
a zillion years ago.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.828
- Hey, y'all. Seat belts fastened?
- Yeah, they're fastened.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.709
I get it. I have a teenager myself.

04:10.709 --> 04:11.793
I'm not hers.

04:32.314 --> 04:36.485
<i>Hey, it's me.
Figured I could give you a ride.</i>

04:36.485 --> 04:39.530
<i>But you probably already left.</i>

04:39.530 --> 04:42.115
You getting any service?
I still have no bars.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.953
- Maybe someone's tracing your phone.
- What?

04:47.496 --> 04:48.497
I was kidding.

04:49.248 --> 04:51.416
Try clicking it in and out
of airplane mode.

04:54.670 --> 04:56.672
You didn't miss anything, by the way.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.173
Dad didn't call.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.013
Welcome to Town Hotel.

05:05.013 --> 05:08.141
- You ladies need a bellhop?
- We're good, thanks.

05:24.992 --> 05:25.993
You coming?

05:29.037 --> 05:32.416
Go ahead. I'll be right there.
Just get in line.

05:47.097 --> 05:50.392
<i>Hey, it's Jake. I need to talk
to you, and the sooner, the better.</i>

05:50.392 --> 05:52.352
<i>The FBI wants to set up formal interview,</i>

05:52.352 --> 05:54.813
<i>which means either they know more
about Owen than they're saying,</i>

05:54.813 --> 05:57.399
<i>or they think they have something on you.</i>

05:57.399 --> 05:59.610
<i>Point is, I don't get you
in front of them soon,</i>

05:59.610 --> 06:01.445
<i>they're gonna start treating you like
a hostile witness.</i>

06:01.445 --> 06:04.448
<i>So I need you to call me back, like, now.</i>

06:36.146 --> 06:38.899
- Who called?
- Just a friend in LA.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.692
- A friend?
- Hi, y'all!

06:40.692 --> 06:42.861
Welcome to Austin.
What can I help you with?

06:42.861 --> 06:45.197
Just checking in for Max Parnes.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.284
Did you bring wigs
and a fake mustache too?

07:45.966 --> 07:49.178
So, he has been
our team mascot since 1916.

07:49.178 --> 07:53.182
Pop quiz. Does anyone know
what the mascot was before Bevo?

07:53.182 --> 07:54.933
I think it was a dog.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.394
Eighth largest stadium in the world.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.354
- At least that's what Wikipedia says.
- An owl.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.064
Wow, are you on a TLC show?

08:01.565 --> 08:03.066
What's going on over here, sir?

08:03.066 --> 08:04.735
Yeah, I see you with the Rice Owls shirt.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.069
What's going on there?

08:06.069 --> 08:08.113
Who let this guy on the tour, huh?

08:08.113 --> 08:09.198
Let's latch on with them.

08:10.199 --> 08:13.118
- It's hot and this is dumb.
- Okay, maybe, but--

08:13.118 --> 08:15.245
Just saying,
this all feels like a waste of time.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.914
Would you rather be in school?

08:18.123 --> 08:20.626
Will you just try coming inside?
Can we start there?

08:20.626 --> 08:21.752
Do I have a choice?

08:22.753 --> 08:24.922
Yes. Always. With me, you always do.

08:24.922 --> 08:28.175
All righty, and if you follow me,
we'll make our way to the field.

08:30.093 --> 08:34.181
That means you too, Mr. Owl. I'll show you
what a real stadium looks like.

08:37.893 --> 08:41.063
That big enclosure y'all saw
on the way in is where we keep Bevo.

08:41.063 --> 08:46.360
So I'm supposed to-- What?
Close my eyes and chant something?

08:47.694 --> 08:50.906
The articles I read just said to try
to take the place in.

08:51.406 --> 08:54.743
Just feel what it's like now
so you can remember what it was like then.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.328
Where'd you get these articles?

08:56.912 --> 08:58.330
Psychology Today.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.542
Max sent an article
in Scientific American.

09:34.950 --> 09:38.453
I'm not feeling anything. Shocker, right?

09:40.497 --> 09:42.082
Maybe we should try somewhere else.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.376
It's the eighth largest stadium
in the world, Hannah.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.044
There are thousands of seats here.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.338
- I'm not saying we should try all of them.
- Good.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.442
Bailey?

10:55.030 --> 10:56.865
I think it was, I--

10:57.866 --> 10:59.576
- I think I was--
- You were here.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.328
Yeah.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.541
But my dad, he was wearing a suit.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.334
At a football game?

11:07.334 --> 11:11.713
Yeah, it's weird, right? I--
It doesn't make any sense.

11:12.422 --> 11:16.593
But it's funny, I remember being
kind of uncomfortable too,

11:16.593 --> 11:20.013
like, itchy, like I was in a dress.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.391
You said you were visiting friends here.

11:22.391 --> 11:26.520
Were you coming from somewhere else,
a party, or something?

11:26.520 --> 11:31.316
I think we were at a party.
A wedding, maybe?

11:32.025 --> 11:34.069
I think we walked here from there.

11:34.570 --> 11:36.029
- From the wedding?
- Yeah.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.034
No, I-- I'm not--

11:41.034 --> 11:42.244
I'm not sure.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.417
<i>Two in section 40-C.</i>

11:48.417 --> 11:50.377
- Yeah, I see them.
- Let's go.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.629
<i>If you walked here,
the church could be close.</i>

11:52.629 --> 11:54.298
Okay, but I--

11:55.007 --> 11:56.008
What?

11:56.717 --> 11:59.136
My dad, it was like he loved it.

12:00.137 --> 12:02.514
- The game?
- Yeah. The game, the team, the stadium.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.349
All of it. But--

12:04.349 --> 12:05.851
Your dad doesn't like football.

12:07.144 --> 12:08.145
No.

12:18.989 --> 12:20.365
Okay, great. Thanks, guys.

12:22.451 --> 12:24.620
Hey. Making any progress?

12:24.620 --> 12:27.372
<i>Maybe.
Bailey thinks she was here for a wedding.</i>

12:27.372 --> 12:28.749
I thought if I can find the church,

12:28.749 --> 12:31.210
I might be able to figure out
whose wedding it was,

12:31.210 --> 12:34.171
- and maybe talk to them and--
- Okay. How can I help?

12:34.171 --> 12:37.883
My Internet is spotty. Can you get
me a list of all the churches near DKR?

12:37.883 --> 12:39.593
Bailey thinks they walked here,

12:39.593 --> 12:42.095
so maybe all the churches
in a two mile radius?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.972
Slow down. Slow down.
Let me get to my desk, okay?

12:43.972 --> 12:45.182
<i>Yeah, yeah. Thanks.</i>

12:47.559 --> 12:50.812
<i>Okay. I'm at my computer.
All churches within two miles of DKR?</i>

12:50.812 --> 12:54.525
And a list of the weekend home games
during the 2011 season.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.568
- Would that be hard to find?
- You know how many sports sites

12:56.568 --> 12:58.403
are out there for all
the fantasy stat nerds?

12:58.403 --> 13:00.531
<i>Hi, I'm Hannah. Have we met?</i>

13:00.531 --> 13:02.324
Okay, a lot, all right?
There are a lot.

13:02.324 --> 13:03.700
<i>Okay. So not hard?</i>

13:03.700 --> 13:06.578
- Nope. Just 2011?
- I think so.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.789
Bailey's pretty sure her mom
was at the wedding.

13:08.789 --> 13:12.543
So, the game had to be before 2012.

13:12.543 --> 13:14.920
And in 2010,
she would've been barely three, so--

13:14.920 --> 13:17.381
So 2011's the only year
she would remember.

13:17.381 --> 13:19.341
- Yeah. I think so.
- Okay. Got it.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.719
Hey, Han. It's Max. How's Bailey?

13:23.846 --> 13:28.684
Not great. You think I'm crazy
for bringing her down here, don't you?

13:29.184 --> 13:31.061
I think it's much better
you're out of town.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.688
Story's only getting worse here.

13:32.688 --> 13:33.772
<i>Worse how?</i>

13:33.772 --> 13:36.400
Well, my sources are saying
that the scope of the investigation

13:36.400 --> 13:37.943
<i>is changing by the hour.</i>

13:37.943 --> 13:40.737
<i>Last I heard,
all senior staff could be indicted.</i>

13:41.738 --> 13:44.157
I haven't heard Owen's name yet,
but it's--

13:45.367 --> 13:47.828
- I'm assuming, you know, he's--
- Guys, I gotta call you back.

13:48.620 --> 13:49.454
Bailey?

13:51.498 --> 13:52.332
Bailey?

14:01.008 --> 14:02.092
Bailey!

15:04.655 --> 15:06.073
Jesus.

15:06.657 --> 15:08.116
I had no idea where you went.

15:08.116 --> 15:11.578
I texted you. You were on the phone.
I texted you I was coming in here.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.373
Bailey, it doesn't matter.
You cannot disappear like that.

15:14.373 --> 15:15.541
Okay. Can you just chill?

15:15.541 --> 15:19.002
Bailey, listen to me. With everything
going on, you have to stay with me.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.712
We need to stay together.

15:30.514 --> 15:32.683
I was supposed to block my solo today.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.436
I had all these ideas.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.231
And I-- I'd started talking
to Mr. K. about it,

15:39.231 --> 15:43.026
and he kept saying he was really
looking forward to it and...

15:46.488 --> 15:49.074
guess that's a stupid thing
to care about now.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.076
No, it's not.

15:52.536 --> 15:56.290
And we'll get back to that, Bailey.
All of it. I promise.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.085
What if he doesn't come back?

16:01.295 --> 16:02.337
He's coming back.

16:04.715 --> 16:05.799
How do you know?

16:06.466 --> 16:08.468
You're here, for starters.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.894
That's Jules.
She's working on the list of churches.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.813
Let's take it one step at a time.

16:23.901 --> 16:25.777
<i>Hey, everything okay?</i>

16:25.777 --> 16:27.237
Yeah. Sorry about that.

16:27.237 --> 16:30.073
- No worries. I just sent you a list.
- Great.

16:30.073 --> 16:32.075
<i>You have to know, there are a bunch.</i>

16:32.075 --> 16:34.328
That's all right.
I think we could use the distraction.

16:34.328 --> 16:35.412
<i>Okay, well,</i>

16:36.538 --> 16:38.415
- keep me posted, all right?
- Thanks.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.921
This isn't gonna get any better for them,
is it?

16:45.088 --> 16:46.256
Not anytime soon.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.679
First one's just down the block.

16:53.305 --> 16:54.306
How many are there?

16:54.306 --> 16:56.099
There's about a dozen,
but only three or four

16:56.099 --> 16:59.811
that are a reasonable walk to the stadium,
especially with a four-year-old.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.733
- You gonna get that?
- Yeah.

17:07.236 --> 17:08.362
Hello?

17:08.362 --> 17:09.570
<i>Hannah? It's me.</i>

17:11.781 --> 17:13.200
Not Dad, huh?

17:13.200 --> 17:14.535
Hannah, you there?

17:15.035 --> 17:17.579
- Hey, Belle.
- Hannah, I've been trying to reach you.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.373
<i>It's not really a great time to talk.</i>

17:19.373 --> 17:21.666
Yes, I know. That's why we're calling.

17:21.666 --> 17:22.751
She's on.

17:24.920 --> 17:25.921
<i>Hey, Hannah.</i>

17:26.547 --> 17:27.548
Avett.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.258
<i>I've been trying to reach your husband.</i>

17:29.258 --> 17:31.218
<i>I was hoping you could help me
out with that.</i>

17:31.218 --> 17:33.887
- I'll let him know you called.
- Great.

17:33.887 --> 17:37.975
This whole thing is gonna shake out.
We're innocent. You know that, Hannah.

17:38.475 --> 17:41.895
I mean, I'm-- Hell, I'm an entrepreneur,
and your husband's a genius.

17:41.895 --> 17:45.566
I don't have to tell you that.
After all, it is his tech.

17:45.566 --> 17:48.026
I think you mean the company's tech.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.736
<i>Of course. Of course.</i>

17:49.736 --> 17:53.282
My point is that this whole thing
is clearly a setup.

17:53.782 --> 17:57.327
Okay, and who exactly is setting you up?

17:57.327 --> 18:00.330
How the hell should I know?
The government? A competitor?

18:00.330 --> 18:04.793
But we gotta beat this, 'cause I have
worked too damn hard for too damn long

18:04.793 --> 18:07.504
to be taken down
by some accounting mishap.

18:07.504 --> 18:11.758
Wait, so is it an accounting mishap
and not a setup?

18:11.758 --> 18:14.553
Are you just saying whatever
you think will get you off the hook?

18:15.137 --> 18:16.221
Excuse me?

18:16.722 --> 18:19.349
<i>Just trying to figure out
what you want here, Avett.</i>

18:20.475 --> 18:22.561
I am trying to help here, Hannah.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.606
The FBI is coming for Owen next,

18:25.606 --> 18:28.525
and I know he does not wanna be
on the wrong side of this.

18:28.525 --> 18:29.818
Not with his history.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.323
- What history?
- Just have Owen get in touch.

18:34.323 --> 18:36.742
My lawyers have been trying to reach him
and we wanna make sure

18:36.742 --> 18:38.952
that he talks to them
before he talks to anybody else.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.580
<i>We both know that is
in Owen's best interest.</i>

18:41.580 --> 18:45.292
No, I don't know.
I'm not following, Avett. What history?

18:45.876 --> 18:49.546
You really don't know?
Then why'd you skip town, Hannah?

18:50.380 --> 18:51.673
Who says I skipped town?

18:51.673 --> 18:54.092
<i>Just tell Owen he needs to call me.</i>

18:55.636 --> 18:56.803
What was that about?

18:58.805 --> 19:00.015
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.850
You know I could actually hear Avett, so--

19:01.850 --> 19:04.269
I'm just trying to protect you
from this stuff, Bailey.

19:05.521 --> 19:08.065
You can't. No one can.

19:09.650 --> 19:12.277
So how about you just tell me the truth?

19:14.446 --> 19:19.117
I think Avett was calling
to threaten me. To threaten us.

19:19.117 --> 19:22.871
He sounded guilty, or at least like
he's trying to cover something up.

19:23.372 --> 19:28.210
And he seemed surprised that your dad
disappeared instead of holing up with him.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.295
So he said my dad was guilty?

19:31.505 --> 19:33.173
Certainly wants us to think that.

19:34.007 --> 19:37.469
And to think he had something
over your father.

19:41.640 --> 19:45.602
Bailey, Avett is just--
he's just trying to cover his own ass.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.939
And for the record, the more people try
to convince me your dad's guilty,

19:48.939 --> 19:52.484
the more I believe he isn't.
Maybe that's naive, but I don't know,

19:52.484 --> 19:54.695
there's something in my gut
that says he's--

19:55.654 --> 20:00.075
he's doing whatever he's doing for us.
For you.

20:06.790 --> 20:09.418
You know, when I said,
to tell me the truth,

20:09.418 --> 20:13.255
I just meant, like,
don't lie about who's on the phone.

20:14.131 --> 20:15.132
Right.

20:16.800 --> 20:17.801
So that was extra?

20:19.469 --> 20:20.470
Yeah.

20:22.514 --> 20:23.724
But in a good way.

21:24.868 --> 21:27.287
- What?
- Something about that tower.

21:27.287 --> 21:30.457
- Does it look familiar?
- More than the last two.

21:50.811 --> 21:52.396
I thought it looked familiar, but...

21:53.897 --> 21:56.775
- where's the next one?
- We should take a break.

21:56.775 --> 21:59.653
Let's go back to the hotel
and get a fresh start tomorrow.

21:59.653 --> 22:03.448
Fresh start on what, Hannah?
We're nowhere.

22:03.949 --> 22:06.285
We're not nowhere.
Look at what you've already remembered.

22:06.285 --> 22:07.786
What, Hannah? What have I remembered?

22:07.786 --> 22:10.080
That I went to a football game
with my father.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.623
That doesn't tell us anything.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.042
And for all we know,
I might be remembering it wrong.

22:14.042 --> 22:15.127
It could've been anywhere.

22:48.994 --> 22:49.995
Bailey.

23:29.618 --> 23:30.869
I think it was here.

23:35.249 --> 23:38.252
- You wanna know what now?
- We just need a list of the weddings

23:38.252 --> 23:42.631
that your pastor performed on game days
during the 2011 football season.

23:42.631 --> 23:46.718
I've already handled most of the legwork.
I've got the dates right here.

23:46.718 --> 23:48.679
There were only five home games.

23:50.806 --> 23:55.477
Uh-huh. Yeah. I'm not
at liberty to give out that information.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.813
You're not at liberty? Really?

24:00.566 --> 24:03.986
I think what Bailey is trying to say is
these are pretty unusual circumstances.

24:03.986 --> 24:07.114
- Maybe you could make an exception.
- I am sorry

24:07.114 --> 24:11.118
that your husband is missing,
and I'm sure you're going through a lot.

24:12.369 --> 24:14.705
But that's just not something we do.

24:14.705 --> 24:16.999
We could sit here and read the names.

24:16.999 --> 24:18.333
Nothing would leave this room.

24:18.333 --> 24:22.296
I'm afraid we have to protect the privacy
of our congregants.

24:22.296 --> 24:25.549
You cannot be serious.
Jesus, who do you think we are?

24:25.549 --> 24:28.051
I'm going to need to excuse myself, friends.

24:28.051 --> 24:31.805
We have a Bible study group starting up,
and I need to prepare for that.

24:31.805 --> 24:33.724
Ms. McGovern,
Bailey didn't mean to be rude.

24:33.724 --> 24:36.810
But you heard
what's going on with her father

24:37.561 --> 24:39.229
and family means everything to us.

24:39.229 --> 24:41.356
You understand that, don't you?

24:42.858 --> 24:44.860
If you were standing here,

24:45.777 --> 24:46.945
what would you hope I'd do?

24:46.945 --> 24:49.031
Because I know I would try
to help you out.

24:55.037 --> 24:56.747
It would be an act of true kindness.

25:06.089 --> 25:07.382
The names can't leave this room.

25:08.383 --> 25:09.760
Go on, have a seat.

25:09.760 --> 25:11.261
Thank you, seriously.

25:11.261 --> 25:13.430
Don't thank me. Thank your stepmother.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.480
Hey, I gotta take this.

25:24.191 --> 25:25.901
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

25:25.901 --> 25:26.985
Sorry, it's been--

25:26.985 --> 25:29.905
<i>You can't ask for my help
and then just disappear.</i>

25:29.905 --> 25:31.490
<i>I got it. What's up?</i>

25:31.990 --> 25:33.742
The Shop COO just got indicted.

25:36.161 --> 25:40.082
- Jordan?
- How closely did Owen work with him?

25:40.791 --> 25:42.376
Jordan was Avett's number two, so...

25:42.960 --> 25:44.211
- Closely.
- Yeah.

25:45.295 --> 25:48.298
Hannah, I gotta be honest.
It's not looking real good for Owen.

25:48.298 --> 25:50.342
- If I were his lawyer--
- Well, you're not.

25:51.301 --> 25:54.763
Yep, you're right. And frankly,
I don't give a shit about your husband.

25:55.472 --> 25:59.434
But I do care about you.
You need to protect yourself here.

25:59.434 --> 26:03.272
<i>The FBI is asking for an interview.
You have to sit with them.</i>

26:03.272 --> 26:07.401
I know. I just--
I need you to buy me one more day, Jake.

26:10.320 --> 26:13.115
Pissing off the FBI is not a good idea.

26:13.115 --> 26:15.242
<i>I know how they operate
in cases like this.</i>

26:15.242 --> 26:17.035
They could charge you with obstruction.

26:17.035 --> 26:19.454
They could try and charge you
as an accessory.

26:19.454 --> 26:21.290
Not to mention leaving Owen's kid vulnerable

26:21.290 --> 26:23.166
to a custody claim from extended family.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.294
No. Owen doesn't have extended family.

26:26.086 --> 26:27.087
That you know of.

26:28.255 --> 26:30.382
Have you heard anything
from your private investigator?

26:30.382 --> 26:32.759
<i>He said he'd have something
by the end of day.</i>

26:32.759 --> 26:33.969
Avett called.

26:35.220 --> 26:37.764
He made it seem like he knew
something damaging about Owen.

26:37.764 --> 26:40.184
About his history, I mean.

26:40.184 --> 26:44.605
<i>This is exactly what I'm saying.
If Owen was involved in something shady,</i>

26:44.605 --> 26:48.317
you need to make it obvious to the Feds
that you didn't have the slightest idea.

26:48.317 --> 26:51.111
<i>You need to cooperate,
so they believe you're telling the truth</i>

26:51.111 --> 26:52.571
<i>no matter what comes out.</i>

26:52.571 --> 26:53.822
I am telling the truth.

26:53.822 --> 26:56.700
Then let me set something up
with them for tomorrow morning.

26:57.659 --> 27:00.370
I can come up to SF
if you want counsel in person.

27:00.370 --> 27:03.040
You want me
to make up numbers and dates?

27:03.040 --> 27:04.291
- No, it's not--
- I gotta go.

27:04.291 --> 27:06.293
- Wait, Hannah--
- Get me one more day, Jake.

27:06.293 --> 27:07.544
- Please.
- Please lower your voice.

27:07.544 --> 27:09.296
- This is wrong.
- Could you check your tone?

27:09.296 --> 27:11.381
It doesn't make sense.
Check in another book.

27:11.381 --> 27:12.841
- No, the book is not wrong.
- I was here.

27:12.841 --> 27:15.177
- Look at every one of these dates, you--
- Can you check it again?

27:15.177 --> 27:16.929
- What's going on?
- No. I checked it twice.

27:16.929 --> 27:19.264
It doesn't make any sense. I was here.

27:19.264 --> 27:21.558
According to my records, we were closed

27:21.558 --> 27:23.894
for construction in the fall of 2011.

27:23.894 --> 27:28.148
Our doors shut on September 1st
and they didn't reopen until March.

27:28.148 --> 27:30.859
There was no services,
no ceremonies, no weddings.

27:30.859 --> 27:32.819
I was here. I know I was here.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.530
Well, maybe you have the year wrong.

27:34.530 --> 27:36.240
No, we don't have the year wrong.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.784
- It had to have been 2011.
- Then it wasn't here.

27:38.784 --> 27:40.994
Are there any other churches
that look like this nearby?

27:40.994 --> 27:42.538
I don't think so.

27:47.751 --> 27:49.127
Why don't you leave me your number,

27:49.127 --> 27:50.963
and I'll call you if I remember anything.

27:50.963 --> 27:52.589
Like you're gonna remember anything.

27:52.589 --> 27:55.342
- Bailey.
- Whatever. I'm so done with this.

28:02.182 --> 28:05.936
- I'm sorry. I appreciate your help.
- It's fine.

28:05.936 --> 28:07.646
I know it isn't me she's angry with.

28:09.690 --> 28:14.319
If you think of anything,
even if it feels unimportant, please call.

28:14.319 --> 28:15.404
I will.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.325
Who does this to his family?

28:21.535 --> 28:22.786
Someone without a choice.

28:51.565 --> 28:54.401
- What you doing there, pal?
- Who the fuck are you?

29:00.991 --> 29:03.285
- I'm a friend of Owen's.
- You're a friend.

29:04.411 --> 29:05.662
Colleague, more like.

29:07.372 --> 29:09.917
Eric Cousins.
Head of security for The Shop.

29:09.917 --> 29:11.293
So Avett sent you?

29:11.293 --> 29:13.545
He's just concerned
about Owen's well-being.

29:14.671 --> 29:15.964
Is that what he's concerned about?

29:17.299 --> 29:18.383
I'll tell you what.

29:18.383 --> 29:20.802
Why don't you let Avett know
that if he sends anyone else,

29:20.802 --> 29:23.013
I'll see to it that Judge Bari
revokes his bail.

29:27.935 --> 29:29.978
Now, go on. Get going.

30:50.809 --> 30:52.644
Where'd you go, Hannah?

31:27.137 --> 31:28.180
Jesus.

31:43.695 --> 31:46.156
Do you know the secret
of a good grilled cheese?

31:46.156 --> 31:48.951
Coating the bread in mayo
instead of butter.

31:50.077 --> 31:52.287
Please tell me that's not how you make
grilled cheese at home.

31:53.121 --> 31:54.122
Afraid so.

31:54.122 --> 31:57.000
That was the one thing I actually liked
about you.

32:00.128 --> 32:01.964
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

32:04.967 --> 32:07.678
So, I know the churches were a bust...

32:09.346 --> 32:12.558
but I was thinking maybe we can still
find a record of the wedding.

32:13.141 --> 32:15.435
- We could head down to the Statesman.
- The Statesman?

32:15.435 --> 32:17.437
It's a local paper. Jules has a contact.

32:17.437 --> 32:19.940
I thought we could go through the archives

32:19.940 --> 32:22.276
and look at
the wedding announcements in 2011.

32:22.276 --> 32:25.404
No. We're not gonna find anything here.

32:25.404 --> 32:28.282
Well, at the very least,
I want to go to the US Marshals' office.

32:28.282 --> 32:31.285
Ask someone what Deputy Bradford
was doing on our doorstep.

32:31.952 --> 32:34.121
Why?
What difference is it gonna make, Hannah?

32:34.121 --> 32:37.332
Dad's gone. He hasn't
called or emailed or anything.

32:37.332 --> 32:38.667
He doesn't wanna be found.

32:38.667 --> 32:42.588
Okay,
but there may be a good reason for that.

32:42.588 --> 32:44.256
Something we need to find out.

32:44.256 --> 32:46.717
No, you're just making shit up now
to make yourself feel better.

32:46.717 --> 32:49.178
But we're not gonna feel better,
'cause this fucking sucks.

32:50.137 --> 32:53.390
Whatever's going on, he clearly was
into something he didn't tell us about.

32:53.390 --> 32:56.310
And me and you playing Encyclopedia Brown
isn't going to change anything.

32:56.310 --> 32:57.686
- Don't you get that?
- Slow down.

32:57.686 --> 33:00.606
No, no. You're not hearing me.
I just-- I wanna go home.

33:01.607 --> 33:02.691
<i>No, Dad.</i>

33:02.691 --> 33:03.859
You're not hearing me.

33:11.909 --> 33:13.118
<i>What's going on?</i>

33:13.619 --> 33:16.830
Bobby's parents invited Bailey
on their boat.

33:16.830 --> 33:17.915
You said "no."

33:18.457 --> 33:23.337
About as quickly as you can say it.
I mean, she's barely 16.

33:23.337 --> 33:25.172
They'll have minimal supervision.

33:25.672 --> 33:26.673
On a boat?

33:28.717 --> 33:29.718
It's a big boat.

33:31.303 --> 33:33.222
Well,
I think that's a reasonable decision.

33:33.722 --> 33:34.723
Yeah.

33:36.183 --> 33:39.019
So why are you down here
sitting in the dark,

33:39.019 --> 33:40.771
clutching her piggy bank?

33:43.482 --> 33:46.985
Her grandmother
bought her this the day she was born.

33:52.282 --> 33:54.868
Soon I'm not going to be able
to tell her "no."

33:56.578 --> 33:58.830
She's gonna leave,
do exactly what she wants,

33:58.830 --> 34:03.794
and I don't think I ever
fully thought about that.

34:05.462 --> 34:07.256
Or maybe I just didn't let myself.

34:09.091 --> 34:10.592
Ah, man.

34:18.266 --> 34:21.978
There's gonna come a time when
I won't be able to keep her safe anymore.

34:24.231 --> 34:25.524
Not from anything.

34:31.530 --> 34:32.406
Hey.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.324
How'd the churches pan out?

34:35.033 --> 34:38.829
Not so great. I think we're
gonna head home tomorrow.

34:38.829 --> 34:40.496
<i>Well, I'll be happy to see you.</i>

34:42.416 --> 34:44.960
- What?
- I just--

34:45.710 --> 34:49.130
Bailey is so out of sorts here.
Makes me wonder.

34:49.130 --> 34:52.176
I'm pretty sure Bailey would be
out of sorts wherever she was.

34:53.051 --> 34:55.846
I don't know. I think maybe it's
because we're onto something.

34:58.223 --> 35:01.852
Then again, maybe I'm just trying to avoid
dealing with the shit show back there.

35:01.852 --> 35:03.812
<i>You know, you have pretty good instincts.</i>

35:03.812 --> 35:07.024
Which is why I haven't spoken
to my husband in three days.

35:07.024 --> 35:08.942
<i>Go easy on yourself, would you?</i>

35:08.942 --> 35:11.945
Not in my nature. Are you still at work?

35:11.945 --> 35:13.280
I just left. Why?

35:13.780 --> 35:17.910
Could you stop at my place on your way
home? I'm sure it's nothing,

35:17.910 --> 35:21.747
but there's a piggy bank in Bailey's room
I want you to look at.

35:22.414 --> 35:25.292
Piggy bank?
Is that some kind of tech bro euphemism?

35:25.959 --> 35:27.127
I wish.

35:27.127 --> 35:30.589
No, there was this weird file on Owen's
laptop that was password-protected,

35:30.589 --> 35:34.510
and the hint was "L. Paul." Lady Paul,

35:35.469 --> 35:38.597
which I think is also
the name on the piggy bank.

35:39.890 --> 35:43.519
And I stopped believing in coincidences
about 48 hours ago.

35:43.519 --> 35:45.646
Okay, I'll head there now.

35:46.230 --> 35:47.272
<i>I don't deserve you.</i>

35:47.773 --> 35:48.899
<i>Nobody does.</i>

35:49.608 --> 35:50.984
<i>Call you when I get there.</i>

36:20.597 --> 36:21.723
- Bails?
- Hey.

36:23.809 --> 36:26.270
So, the s'mores worked. Noted.

36:26.937 --> 36:29.189
- What?
- Are you at home?

36:29.857 --> 36:30.983
Open your front door.

36:30.983 --> 36:34.027
I'm actually in Austin.

36:34.027 --> 36:35.904
<i>Austin? Why?</i>

36:36.488 --> 36:40.951
<i>Good question. I don't know.
Hiding out from all my fans.</i>

36:42.578 --> 36:46.331
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but you're no longer trending.

36:46.915 --> 36:48.208
- Really?
- Yep.

36:48.208 --> 36:52.296
Livvy and Alex ended things
in pretty spectacular fashion.

36:53.005 --> 36:54.298
<i>What happened?</i>

36:54.298 --> 36:56.049
Let's just say it involved a large bottle
of Diet Coke

36:56.049 --> 36:57.926
<i>being poured over Alex's head.</i>

36:59.428 --> 37:02.347
I have never been so relieved
to not matter.

37:03.599 --> 37:08.896
Good. So, should I come
rescue you from your wicked stepmother?

37:10.898 --> 37:12.941
She's maybe not the worst person ever.

37:13.775 --> 37:17.738
I'm sorry,
thought I was talking to Bailey Michaels.

37:39.718 --> 37:40.719
Hello?

38:24.513 --> 38:25.889
What the fuck is this?

38:51.206 --> 38:54.334
Whoever's in here, I just called 911!

38:55.294 --> 38:56.545
Jules?

39:01.800 --> 39:03.177
What the hell are you doing here?

39:03.760 --> 39:04.887
I need to talk to Hannah.

39:04.887 --> 39:07.014
What, so you just let yourself
into her house?

39:07.014 --> 39:09.558
Well, the door was wide open.
But it's great to see you too.

39:11.476 --> 39:14.563
- Is she here?
- No. She's not here.

39:15.647 --> 39:18.483
- Well, I need to talk to her.
- God. About what?

39:20.235 --> 39:22.112
I need to tell her directly.

39:23.197 --> 39:25.824
Well, you're going to have to tell me
directly first, Jake.

39:26.325 --> 39:28.243
'Cause I'm the only one who knows
where she is.

40:38.522 --> 40:40.232
Hey. Did you find the piggy bank?

40:40.858 --> 40:41.859
<i>Yeah.</i>

40:43.110 --> 40:44.111
But...

40:46.071 --> 40:47.322
can Bailey hear you?

40:48.323 --> 40:50.951
No, she's asleep. Why? What's going on?

40:52.369 --> 40:54.246
Jake's here. I'm gonna put him on.

40:54.246 --> 40:56.290
<i>What? Why is Jake there?</i>

40:56.290 --> 40:57.374
<i>Hey.</i>

40:58.292 --> 41:00.043
What are you doing in my house?

41:01.420 --> 41:06.216
I wanted to be here.
I needed to tell you this in person.

41:07.134 --> 41:09.094
Tell me what? Jake.

41:09.887 --> 41:15.350
I heard back from my investigator.
It took him a minute because, well,

41:16.351 --> 41:20.022
<i>Owen and Bailey's histories
are inconsistent.</i>

41:21.315 --> 41:23.192
What do you mean inconsistent?

41:23.859 --> 41:27.279
<i>There are several Owen Michaels
who grew up in Newton, Massachusetts,</i>

41:27.279 --> 41:29.865
<i>and a few who graduated
from Princeton University.</i>

41:29.865 --> 41:34.411
But the only Owen Michaels who's
from Newton and went to Princeton

41:34.411 --> 41:37.164
is 78 years old
and now lives with his partner,

41:37.164 --> 41:40.876
Theo Silverstein,
in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

41:41.668 --> 41:42.669
That's not possible.

41:43.170 --> 41:46.507
<i>My guy couldn't find a marriage license
for Owen Michaels or Olivia Miller.</i>

41:46.507 --> 41:49.051
He also couldn't find any evidence

41:49.051 --> 41:52.095
that Owen and Olivia ever owned
a home in Seattle.

41:53.180 --> 41:54.848
Wait, I don't understand, I--

41:55.933 --> 41:57.893
He couldn't find anything on Bailey, either.

41:58.477 --> 42:02.189
<i>No Seattle birth certificate of
a Bailey Michaels born in the early 2000s.</i>

42:02.189 --> 42:06.109
No hospital birth records.
No preschool registration.

42:06.944 --> 42:08.862
My guy is pretty sure there's
no record of any kind

42:08.862 --> 42:12.366
for either Owen or Bailey prior
to Sausalito.

42:12.950 --> 42:13.951
Really?

42:14.701 --> 42:20.040
<i>Basically,
Owen and Bailey Michaels don't exist.</i>

42:33.679 --> 42:34.805
Hannah?
