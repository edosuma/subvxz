This next patient is interesting.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.590
I've been following
the case for years.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.793
A 29-year-old female,

14:39.212 --> 14:41.761
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.012
The usual indicators:
depression, anxiety,

14:44.217 --> 14:46.766
violent acting out,
delusions of persecution.

14:53.434 --> 14:56.563
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

14:56.771 --> 14:59.615
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator,

14:59.816 --> 15:01.033
which looked human, of course,

15:01.234 --> 15:03.828
was sent back through time
to kill her.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.154
That's original.

15:05.363 --> 15:08.082
And also,
that the father of her child

15:08.282 --> 15:11.126
was a soldier
sent back to protect her.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.625
- No?
- He was from the future too.

15:13.830 --> 15:18.631
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.712
And here we are.

15:21.546 --> 15:22.593

15:27.051 --> 15:30.897
Good morning, Dr Silberman.
How's the knee?

15:32.807 --> 15:34.684
Fine, Sarah.

15:35.893 --> 15:41.070
She, er... stabbed me in the kneecap
with my pen a few weeks ago.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.242

15:53.578 --> 15:55.672

15:56.914 --> 15:59.508
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.804
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.435
Time to take you meds, Connor.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.987
You take it.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.359
You gotta be good.
You're up for review this afternoon.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.360
I'm not taking it.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.822
- I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't no trouble...

16:35.203 --> 16:36.170
Yeah, zap her.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.553
Last call, sugar.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.190
Sweet dreams.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.506
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

17:29.298 --> 17:31.676
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

17:32.510 --> 17:35.229
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.148
He took off on his bike this morning
so he could be anywhere.

17:38.349 --> 17:41.853
- Do you have a photograph of John?
- Yeah. Hold on.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.158
You gonna tell me what this is about?

17:47.358 --> 17:49.235
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.700
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

17:54.907 --> 17:58.161
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him, too.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.087
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.211
Has that got something
to do with this?

18:04.625 --> 18:08.471
No. I wouldn't worry about him.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.391
Thanks for your cooperation.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.137
Please insert
your stolen card now.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.404
PIN number.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.240
Hurry up.
This is taking too long.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.818
Go, baby. Go, baby.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.870
All right!

18:33.070 --> 18:36.574
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

18:36.782 --> 18:39.205
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

18:40.369 --> 18:43.498
Withdraw three-zero-zero bucks.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.425
Come on, baby. Come on! Come on!

18:46.626 --> 18:48.720
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

18:48.919 --> 18:52.469
All right. Easy money. Come on!

18:55.092 --> 18:57.094
Yes! Piece of cake.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.482
- Is that her?
- Yes.

19:05.686 --> 19:09.736
- She's pretty cool, huh?
- No, she's a complete psycho.

19:09.940 --> 19:13.570
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute, OK?

19:14.445 --> 19:16.322
She tried to blow up
a computer factory,

19:16.530 --> 19:17.827
but she got shot and arrested.

19:18.032 --> 19:19.500
No shit.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.624
She's a total loser.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.422
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

19:51.691 --> 19:52.817
Sarah.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.870
Sarah, wake up.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.083
Kyle?

20:08.290 --> 20:09.291
You're dead.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.381
Where's our son, Sarah?

20:12.461 --> 20:14.555
They took him away from me.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.009
- He's the target now.
- I know!

20:18.217 --> 20:20.094
He's alone.
You have to protect him.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.599
I know.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.561
You tell me how I am supposed
to do that.

20:25.349 --> 20:26.976
He doesn't even
believe me anymore.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.319
I've lost him.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.272
You're strong, Sarah.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.824
- Stronger than you ever thought.
- No.

20:35.276 --> 20:36.619
On your feet, soldier!

20:38.779 --> 20:41.248
I love you. I always will.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.712
- I need you.
- I'll always be with you.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.840
Remember the message?

20:54.545 --> 20:56.013
"The future is not set.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.851
"There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves."

21:21.197 --> 21:22.449
Stay with me.

21:23.657 --> 21:26.080
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.552
KWQ, don't go!

21:47.765 --> 21:49.017
Kyle!

23:01.672 --> 23:04.926
It's like a giant strobe light,

23:05.634 --> 23:07.511
burning right to my eyes.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.151
Somehow I can still see.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.874
We know
the dream's the same every night.

23:29.241 --> 23:32.415
- Why do I have to...
- Please continue.

23:36.332 --> 23:38.835
Children look like burnt paper.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.054
Black.

23:43.005 --> 23:44.632
Not moving.

23:46.550 --> 23:49.394
And then the blast wave hits them.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.777
And they fly apart like leaves.

24:02.733 --> 24:07.910
Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world are very common.

24:09.907 --> 24:14.003
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.

24:14.203 --> 24:17.958
- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels very real to you.

24:18.165 --> 24:23.262
On August 291997, it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you, too!

24:24.546 --> 24:26.924
Anybody not wearing
two-million sunblock

24:27.132 --> 24:29.635
is gonna have
a real bad day. Get it?

24:30.135 --> 24:32.854
God! You think you're safe and alive.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.228
You're already dead. Everybody!

24:35.432 --> 24:37.855
Him. You. You're dead already.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.813
This whole place,
everything you see is gone!

24:41.021 --> 24:43.991
You're the one
living in a fucking dream, Silberman!

24:44.191 --> 24:44.987
Cos I know it happened!

24:45.192 --> 24:46.785
It happened!

24:58.080 --> 25:00.003
I feel much better now.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.960
Clearer.

25:03.168 --> 25:08.516
Yes, your attitude has been
much improved lately.

25:17.725 --> 25:20.069
It's helped me to have a goal,

25:20.853 --> 25:23.322
something to look forward to.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.569
What is that?

25:25.441 --> 25:30.914
Well, you said that if I showed
improvement after six months,

25:31.113 --> 25:33.662
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing

25:33.866 --> 25:36.961
and I could have visitors.

25:38.245 --> 25:41.545
Well, it's been six months and...

25:43.459 --> 25:45.587
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.297
I see.

25:51.467 --> 25:56.564
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

25:56.764 --> 26:00.018
Now you think they don't exist?

26:00.225 --> 26:02.444
They don't exist.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.237
I know that now.

26:04.438 --> 26:06.236
But you've told me
on many occasions

26:06.440 --> 26:09.785
about how you crushed one
in a hydraulic press.

26:11.153 --> 26:14.157
If I had, there would have been
some evidence.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.662
They would have found something
at the factory.

26:16.867 --> 26:18.869
I see.

26:19.078 --> 26:22.924
So, you don't believe any more
that the company covered it up?

26:25.084 --> 26:27.553
No. Why would they?

26:28.462 --> 26:30.715
Let's try a new position right there.

26:30.923 --> 26:35.099
The neuronal sensors are correct,
because it works.

26:35.302 --> 26:37.805
- Right.
- Those neurons are all centred.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.682
Maybe
the inhibitor circuits failed...

26:40.891 --> 26:41.983
Mr Dyson?

26:42.810 --> 26:45.859
Mr Dyson, the materials team
is running another...

26:47.022 --> 26:48.569
- Mr Dyson.
- Yes?

26:48.774 --> 26:51.618
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

26:51.819 --> 26:54.663
You have to sign for the...
Er... it.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.787
- You have to sign it out.
- OK. Come on. I'll get it.

26:59.576 --> 27:00.623
Mr Dyson,

27:00.828 --> 27:02.671
I know I haven't been here long, but
I was wondering if you could tell me,

27:02.871 --> 27:05.044
- I mean, if you know...
- Know what?

27:05.249 --> 27:07.798
Well, if you know
where "it" came from.

27:08.001 --> 27:11.301
I asked them that very same question
once. You know what they told me?

27:11.505 --> 27:12.677
"Don't ask."

27:19.388 --> 27:21.482
- Good morning, Mr Dyson.
- How's it going?

27:22.474 --> 27:23.771
Insert key.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.946
Left on three, two, one, turn.

27:30.858 --> 27:32.610
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

27:32.818 --> 27:33.990
There you go.

28:01.805 --> 28:04.274
So,
what do you think, Doctor?

28:05.350 --> 28:07.102
I have shown improvement, haven't I?

28:08.478 --> 28:11.527
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.068
I know how smart you are.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.786
I think you're just telling me
what I want to hear.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.624
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

28:20.908 --> 28:22.626
I think if I put you
in minimum security,

28:22.826 --> 28:24.828
you'll just try to escape again.

28:29.917 --> 28:32.511
You have to let me see my son.

28:33.462 --> 28:34.964
Please.

28:36.465 --> 28:37.762
Please.

28:39.051 --> 28:42.931
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.890
If I could just make a phone call...

28:45.098 --> 28:48.022
Afraid not. Not for a while.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.239
I don't see any choice
but to recommend to the review board

28:52.439 --> 28:54.737
that you stay here
for another six months.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.822
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

29:02.407 --> 29:05.661
- Get her off of me!
- You son of a bitch!

29:05.869 --> 29:08.122
10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!

29:09.790 --> 29:12.418
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

29:15.170 --> 29:17.798
You don't know what you're doing!

29:22.219 --> 29:24.267
Model citizen.

30:03.635 --> 30:06.229
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.023
He said he was going to the galleria?

30:08.223 --> 30:09.270
Yeah.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.101
The galleria?

30:57.147 --> 30:59.525
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

31:14.581 --> 31:17.209
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

31:17.417 --> 31:18.919
No.

31:21.088 --> 31:24.968
- Hey, do you know this guy?
- Nah, I don't know him.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.149
- John.
- Not now.

31:33.350 --> 31:36.194
Hey, there's this cop
scoping for you. Check it out.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.571
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.698
- Just go.
- Yeah.

31:48.949 --> 31:49.950
I saw that kid...

31:50.158 --> 31:51.284
Hey!

32:05.632 --> 32:07.350
Hey! You're not supposed
to be in here!

32:25.527 --> 32:27.074
Hey!

32:33.201 --> 32:34.248
Get down.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.196
Mister, are you all right?

34:05.043 --> 34:06.090
Come on!

34:46.333 --> 34:47.677
Goddamn!

38:10.205 --> 38:11.627
Agh!

39:26.823 --> 39:29.201
OK. Time out. Stop the bike.

39:29.409 --> 39:31.332
Time out. Come on, stop the bike.

39:45.174 --> 39:47.768
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

39:47.969 --> 39:50.017
- But you are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

39:50.221 --> 39:54.067
- Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
- No?

40:04.777 --> 40:08.873
Holy shit! You're really real.

40:11.284 --> 40:12.752
I mean...

40:15.413 --> 40:19.793
You're like a machine underneath,
right? But sort of alive outside?

40:20.001 --> 40:21.799
I'm a cybernetic organism:

40:22.003 --> 40:24.552
living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.485
This is intense.

40:41.689 --> 40:44.408
Get a grip, John. OK.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.072
You're not here to kill me.

40:49.280 --> 40:53.205
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

40:53.409 --> 40:56.003
My mission is to protect you.

40:56.204 --> 40:58.707
Yeah? Who sent you?

40:59.999 --> 41:01.000
You did.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.552
35 years from now,

41:02.752 --> 41:06.131
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here, in this time.

41:06.339 --> 41:09.092
Oh, this is deep.

41:31.698 --> 41:34.542
This other guy,
he's a terminator like you, right?

41:34.742 --> 41:38.212
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

41:39.914 --> 41:44.340
- More advanced than you are?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

41:45.253 --> 41:47.676
- What the hell does that mean?
- Liquid metal.

41:49.424 --> 41:50.550
Where are we going?

41:50.758 --> 41:52.510
We have to get out of the city
immediately

41:52.719 --> 41:53.971
and avoid the authorities.

41:54.762 --> 41:57.436
Listen, I got to stop by my house.
I want to pick up some stuff.

41:57.640 --> 42:01.611
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

42:01.811 --> 42:04.485
- You sure?
- I would.

42:15.241 --> 42:17.835
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

42:20.163 --> 42:21.506
...but I gotta warn them.

42:21.706 --> 42:24.050
Shit! You got a quarter?

42:32.884 --> 42:35.763
- Hello.
- 'Janelle, it's me.'

42:35.970 --> 42:38.189
- John?
- 'Yeah. Is everything all right?'

42:38.389 --> 42:40.687
- Are you guys OK?
- 'Sure, honey, everything's OK.'

42:40.892 --> 42:43.896
- Are you all right?
- 'Yeah, I'm fine.'

42:44.103 --> 42:47.573
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

42:47.774 --> 42:50.323
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

42:50.526 --> 42:51.948
I'm making beef stew.

42:52.153 --> 42:54.247
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

42:54.447 --> 42:56.825
John, where are you?

42:57.033 --> 42:59.786
What the hell is the goddamn dog
barking at?

42:59.994 --> 43:03.123
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

43:03.331 --> 43:04.674
The dog's really barking.

43:04.874 --> 43:06.968
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that fucking mutt.

43:11.005 --> 43:13.633
John, honey, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

43:13.841 --> 43:17.846
- Could he already be there?
- Honey, are you OK?

43:18.054 --> 43:20.227
I'm right here. I'm fine.

43:20.431 --> 43:21.933
'Are you sure you're all right?'

43:22.141 --> 43:24.940
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

43:25.561 --> 43:27.780
Janelle, what's wrong
with Wolfie?

43:27.980 --> 43:30.449
I can hear him barking. Is he OK?

43:30.650 --> 43:33.324
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

43:34.654 --> 43:36.156
Where are you?

43:37.949 --> 43:39.826
Your foster parents are dead.

44:16.821 --> 44:18.823
No, no. I need a minute here.

44:19.031 --> 44:23.207
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

44:23.411 --> 44:25.755
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

44:25.955 --> 44:27.753
Get real.

44:27.957 --> 44:31.587
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

44:31.794 --> 44:33.467
No, only an object of equal size.

44:33.671 --> 44:36.094
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

44:36.299 --> 44:40.020
It can't form complex machines.
Guns, explosives have chemicals,

44:40.219 --> 44:42.392
moving parts.
It doesn't work that way.

44:42.597 --> 44:44.190
But it can form solid metal shapes.

44:44.390 --> 44:47.234
- Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

46:44.885 --> 46:47.138
These were taken
by a video surveillance camera

46:47.346 --> 46:50.691
at the West Highland police station
in 1984.

46:52.184 --> 46:55.108
He killed
17 police officers that night.

46:56.731 --> 46:58.859
Men with families...

47:00.234 --> 47:01.827
...children.

47:03.321 --> 47:07.667
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda today.

47:09.035 --> 47:12.960
Miss Connor,
we know you know who this guy is.

47:15.124 --> 47:19.425
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing.

47:19.628 --> 47:21.505
That the foster parents
have been murdered.

47:21.714 --> 47:23.967
We know this guy's involved.

47:25.176 --> 47:29.022
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

47:33.392 --> 47:39.525
- We're wasting our time. Let's go.
- Sorry, guys.

47:39.732 --> 47:42.235
She's grown more and more
disconnected from reality

47:42.443 --> 47:43.945
as time goes on.

47:44.153 --> 47:45.826
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

47:46.030 --> 47:49.705
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

47:49.909 --> 47:51.252
Sure.

47:51.452 --> 47:54.205
Douglas,
take her back to her room, please.

47:54.413 --> 47:55.505
Yes, sir.

47:57.166 --> 47:59.214
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

47:59.418 --> 48:04.390
You see, we spent a lot of time
in Nicaragua and places like that.

48:06.509 --> 48:10.139
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy

48:10.429 --> 48:11.555
running guns.

48:11.764 --> 48:14.608
Then there were some other guys.

48:14.809 --> 48:16.561
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from

48:16.769 --> 48:19.989
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

48:21.857 --> 48:23.780
Then she gets busted.

48:23.984 --> 48:27.488
It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

48:29.824 --> 48:31.747
It's like everything
I'd been brought up to believe

48:31.951 --> 48:33.703
was all made-up bullshit.

48:33.911 --> 48:36.334
I hated her for that.

48:39.667 --> 48:42.295
But everything she said was true.

48:43.671 --> 48:45.548
She knew.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.802
And nobody believed her.

48:51.637 --> 48:53.480
Not even me.

48:55.516 --> 48:57.268
Listen,
we gotta get her out of there.

48:57.476 --> 49:00.821
Negative. The T-1000's
highest probability for success now

49:01.021 --> 49:02.238
will be to copy Sarah Connor

49:02.440 --> 49:03.942
and wait for you
to make contact with her.

49:04.150 --> 49:06.118
Great. What happens to her?

49:06.318 --> 49:09.071
Typically, the subject
being copied is terminated.

49:09.280 --> 49:12.250
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

49:12.450 --> 49:14.578
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

49:14.785 --> 49:16.787
Fuck you! She's a priority to me!

49:18.664 --> 49:21.508
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Damn it!

49:21.709 --> 49:24.553
- Help! Help!
- This does not help our mission.

49:24.753 --> 49:27.097
Get this psycho off of me! Help!

49:27.298 --> 49:30.222
Help! I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

49:30.426 --> 49:31.348
Let me go!

49:36.015 --> 49:39.645
- Why the hell did you do that?
- Because you told me to.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.153
What?

49:48.986 --> 49:50.954
You have to do what I say, huh?

49:51.155 --> 49:53.249
That's one of my mission parameters.

49:54.533 --> 49:58.037
Prove it. Stand on one foot.

50:00.247 --> 50:01.590
Yes!

50:03.792 --> 50:07.387
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

50:08.881 --> 50:11.600
- You OK, kid?
- Take a hike, bozo.

50:11.800 --> 50:16.226
- Let's get outta here, man.
- Fuck you, you little dipshit!

50:17.056 --> 50:18.649
Dipshit?

50:20.684 --> 50:22.686
Put your leg down.

50:22.895 --> 50:27.571
- Did you call moi dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

50:27.775 --> 50:30.028
Grab this guy.
I can't believe he called me...

50:30.236 --> 50:32.864
Agh! God! Get him off of me!

50:33.072 --> 50:36.121
Now who's the dipshit,
you jock douche bag?

50:36.325 --> 50:37.542
Get off me!

50:43.749 --> 50:44.875
No!

50:46.126 --> 50:48.424
Put the gun down, now!

50:48.629 --> 50:51.803
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

50:58.806 --> 51:00.649
Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!

51:00.849 --> 51:02.851
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

51:05.187 --> 51:07.736
Listen to me very carefully, OK?

51:07.940 --> 51:11.160
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

51:11.360 --> 51:13.454
You got that?

51:13.654 --> 51:15.998
You just can't go around
killing people.

51:16.198 --> 51:17.074
Why?

51:18.033 --> 51:20.206
What do you mean, why?
Cos you can't.

51:20.411 --> 51:21.253
Why?

51:21.453 --> 51:24.127
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

51:30.170 --> 51:33.640
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.

51:33.841 --> 51:37.266
And I order you to help me.

52:43.452 --> 52:45.204
Hm!

54:02.990 --> 54:04.037
Hi!

54:04.241 --> 54:08.291
- You have a Sarah Connor here?
- You're running late, aren't you?

54:08.495 --> 54:10.748
They've been in there for an hour.

54:10.956 --> 54:13.300
Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.

54:15.169 --> 54:17.797
Oh, here come your friends now.

54:37.483 --> 54:39.406
Well, that was productive.

55:20.859 --> 55:23.863
- Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

55:24.613 --> 55:25.614
How 'bout a beer?

55:25.823 --> 55:27.245
Yeah, right!

55:51.306 --> 55:54.776
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Lewis.

55:54.977 --> 55:56.900
Must be my lucky day.

58:19.579 --> 58:21.957
I think you're right
about number 24.

58:22.165 --> 58:24.884
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

58:25.085 --> 58:27.304
- Same time?
- Mm-hmm.

58:41.309 --> 58:43.482
You!

58:47.816 --> 58:49.614
You broke my arm.

58:49.818 --> 58:52.412
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

58:52.612 --> 58:55.161
That's one. Now, don't move.

59:01.163 --> 59:02.836
What are you gonna do?

59:06.460 --> 59:08.508
Why do we stop now?

59:09.838 --> 59:13.559
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

59:13.759 --> 59:16.228
- Right.
- Swear?

59:16.428 --> 59:17.805
What?

59:18.013 --> 59:21.017
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

59:22.184 --> 59:26.064
- I swear I will not kill anyone.
- All right. Let's go.

59:33.236 --> 59:36.991
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,
Monday through Friday.

59:41.286 --> 59:45.041
- What the hell are you doing?
- You son of a bitch! You shot me!

59:46.708 --> 59:48.176
You crazy bastard!

59:52.589 --> 59:54.717
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

59:58.512 --> 01:00:00.014
He'll live.

01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:16.863
Son of a bitch!

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:19.662
Let's try to remain calm.

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:21.664
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:23.791
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:26.123
Open the door.
It ain't gonna happen.

01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:28.174
Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:30.002
It won't work, Sarah.
You're no killer.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.553
I don't believe you can do it.

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:33.005
You're already dead, Silberman.

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:34.635
Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.470
- So don't fuck with me!
- Open the door. Open the door.

01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:46.985
Back off!

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:48.482
Get back!

01:00:48.687 --> 01:00:50.485
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

01:00:52.357 --> 01:00:53.904
Don't move!

01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:58.205
- Drop the shit!
- Do it! Do it!

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.078
Get in the office.
On the floor, face down.

01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:02.375
Not you!

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:04.078
Open the door.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.333
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:28.060
Get her! Get her!

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:55.841
Sarah!

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:58.890
- Hurry up! Open the door!
- The door's locked!

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.851
Let's go! Open it!

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:02.848
Get the other door!

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:06.314
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:14.026
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:40.719
No!

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:42.267
No!

01:02:44.344 --> 01:02:47.314
- No!
- Mom, wait!

01:02:47.514 --> 01:02:48.811
Mom!

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:57.987
- Come back here!
- No! No!

01:02:58.608 --> 01:02:59.700
No!

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:01.403
- Help her!
- Wait here.

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:03.113
Hurry UP!

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:05.289
He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:06.582
Hold her.

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:09.832
He'll kill us all!

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:33.727
Mom, are you OK? Mom!

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.738
Come with me, if you want to live.

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:43.161
It's OK, Mom. He's here to help.
It's OK.

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:09.095
Go.

01:04:41.586 --> 01:04:43.964
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:00.238
Get down.

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:18.548
No! Mom!

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:38.060
Out of the car!

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:40.649
Right now!

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:07.135
Go!

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:18.604
I'm out.

01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:27.317
- Come on.
- Here.

01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:31.951
Reload.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:42.882
Last one!

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.633
Hang on.

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:19.244
Ready!

01:07:24.832 --> 01:07:26.175
John!

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:34.885
Here, drive.

01:08:28.563 --> 01:08:30.564
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:32.946
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:38.493
- Can you even see anything?
- I see everything.

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:43.127
Cool.

01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:48.420
Come here.

01:08:54.546 --> 01:08:56.174
I said I was OK.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:09:00.103
John,
it was stupid of you to go there.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.348
God damnit! You have to be
smarter than that.

01:09:03.555 --> 01:09:05.024
You almost got yourself killed.

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:07.984
What were you thinking?

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.523
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:13.073
Do you understand?

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:17.450
You're too important.
Do you understand?

01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:21.448
But...

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:26.879
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:30.466
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:39.301
What's wrong with your eyes?

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:42.812
Nothing.

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:55.112
So, what's your story?

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:06.749
You OK?

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:08.375
Fine.

01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:13.384
Say, that's a nice bike.

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:37.526
Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.

01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:48.336
Listen,
do you know what you're doing?

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:51.380
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:57.303
I bet! Makes you
a more efficient killer, right?

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:58.550
Correct.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.558
Does it hurt when you get shot?

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:11.442
I sense injuries. The data
could be called pain.

01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:15.730
John, help me with the light.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.948
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:21.616
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:25.323
How long do you live,
I mean "last", whatever?

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:28.243
120 years with
my existing power cell.

01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:31.212
Can you learn stuff you
haven't been programmed with?

01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:36.380
So you can be...
you know, more human?

01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:38.803
Not such a dork all the time?

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:46.136
My CPU is a neural-net processor,
a learning computer,

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:49.389
hat Skynet presets to READ
only when we are sent out alone.

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:54.185
Doesn't want you
to do too much thinking.

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:55.774
No.

01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:59.281
Can we reset the switch?

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:21.345
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:28.686
Do it.

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:39.147
Now open the port cover.

01:12:42.567 --> 01:12:44.615
Pull to break the seal.

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:52.118
Good, now remove
the shock damping assembly.

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:57.958
You can now access the CPU.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:00.843
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.588
Pull the CPU by its base tap.

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:06.344
Pull.

01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:45.595
Can you see the pin switch?

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:47.424
No!

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:51.098
- Out of my way, John!
- Don't kill him!

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:54.893
"It", John, not "him".

01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:58.063
Okay, "it". But we need "it".

01:13:58.893 --> 01:14:00.486
Listen to me. Listen.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.022
We're better off on our own.

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:06.780
He's the only proof of
the future, the war and that.

01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:09.327
Maybe.

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.533
I don't trust it.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:15.702
But he's my friend, alright?

01:14:16.827 --> 01:14:19.171
You don't know what it's like
to kill these things.

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:22.504
If something goes wrong,
this could be our last chance.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:25.302
If I'm supposed to
be this military leader,

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:28.552
maybe you start listening
to my ideas once in a while.

01:14:32.259 --> 01:14:35.889
'Cause if my own mother won't,
how do you expect anyone else to?

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:54.039
Alright, play it your way.

01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:03.541
Was there a problem?

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:05.126
No problem.

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:08.053
None whatsoever.

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:43.206
Are we learning yet?

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:59.188
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:04.943
Just head south.

01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:14.954
Keep it under 65.

01:16:15.154 --> 01:16:17.782
- We don't wanna be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:23.497
No, no, no. You gotta listen
to the way people talk.

01:16:23.704 --> 01:16:27.129
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:29.506
<i>You say, "No problemo."</i>

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:33.510
And if someone comes up to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:37.844
And if you want to shine them on,
it's <i>"Hasta</i> la vista, baby."

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:40.471
<i>Hasta</i> la vista, baby.

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:43.232
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:46.231
And if someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:50.861
- Or you can do combinations.
- Chill out, dick-wad.

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:53.697
That's great. See? You're getting it.

01:16:53.901 --> 01:16:55.824
<i>No problemo.</i>

01:17:06.163 --> 01:17:09.383
- You got any cash?
- I got a couple of hundred bucks.

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:10.925
I'll give you half.

01:17:11.919 --> 01:17:13.045
Mom!

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:15.802
Get some food.

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:20.265
No sense of humor.

01:17:26.267 --> 01:17:27.940
And that's another thing:

01:17:28.269 --> 01:17:29.771
lighten up a bit.

01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:34.867
This severe routine is getting old.
You're acting like such a geek.

01:17:35.109 --> 01:17:36.577
Smile once in a while.

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:38.162
Smile?

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:40.865
Yeah. You know, smile.

01:17:41.198 --> 01:17:42.245
Watch.

01:17:43.742 --> 01:17:47.042
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

01:17:47.955 --> 01:17:49.423
Gimme a break.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:53.427
Okay. Bad example.

01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:57.265
See that guy over there?
That's a smile.

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:18.573
That's good.

01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:21.948
You could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:30.665
Want some of my fries?

01:18:41.425 --> 01:18:42.551
Do you need any help?

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:44.227
No.

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:46.146
- Got you!
- No, you didn't!

01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:47.815
- Got you!
- No, you didn't!

01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:56.862
We're not gonna make it, are we?

01:18:59.526 --> 01:19:00.778
People, I mean.

01:19:03.781 --> 01:19:05.783
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

01:19:06.951 --> 01:19:09.579
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

01:19:09.787 --> 01:19:12.666
Break it up
before I wring both of your necks.

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:19.138
I need to know how Skynet gets built,
who's responsible.

01:19:19.338 --> 01:19:22.808
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

01:19:23.717 --> 01:19:24.843
Who is that?

01:19:25.052 --> 01:19:28.181
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

01:19:31.475 --> 01:19:33.102
Why him?

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:35.563
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:37.023
of microprocessor.

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:41.027
- Go on. Then what?
- In three years,

01:19:41.235 --> 01:19:43.203
Cyberdyne will become the largest
supplier

01:19:43.404 --> 01:19:44.656
of military computer systems.

01:19:45.656 --> 01:19:48.455
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers,

01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:50.002
becoming fully unmanned.

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:53.331
Afterwards, they fly
with a perfect operational record.

01:19:53.539 --> 01:19:55.917
The Skynet Funding bill is passed.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:59.425
The system goes on-line
on August 41997.

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:02.552
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defence.

01:20:02.756 --> 01:20:05.475
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:09.852
It becomes self-aware at 02:14am
Eastern time, August 29.

01:20:11.015 --> 01:20:13.359
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

01:20:14.685 --> 01:20:16.904
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:19.607
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:22.864
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:25.321
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack

01:20:25.529 --> 01:20:27.327
will eliminate its enemies over here.

01:20:27.531 --> 01:20:29.033
Jesus!

01:20:32.453 --> 01:20:33.625
How much do you know about Dyson?

01:20:36.415 --> 01:20:38.088
I have detailed files.

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.136
Want to know everything.

01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:46.134
What he looks like.
Where he lives. Everything.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.272
Miles!

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:24.714
- You going to work all day?
- I'm sorry, baby.

01:21:25.172 --> 01:21:26.924
This thing
is kicking my ass.

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:31.138
It's Sunday. You promised to take
the kids to Raging Waters today.

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:36.275
I can't. I'm on a roll.

01:21:50.114 --> 01:21:53.368
This is gonna blow 'em away.
It's a neural-net processor.

01:21:53.617 --> 01:21:55.085
I know. You told me.

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:58.080
It thinks and learns like we do.

01:21:58.539 --> 01:22:00.962
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:05.179
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:09.137
Why is that so important?

01:22:09.383 --> 01:22:11.852
I need to know,
'cause sometimes I feel like

01:22:12.302 --> 01:22:14.430
I'm going crazy here.

01:22:15.973 --> 01:22:17.896
Baby, I am this close.

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:19.981
Come here.

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:26.158
Imagine a jet airliner
with a pilot that never gets tired,

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.574
never makes mistakes,
never shows up with a hangover.

01:22:32.072 --> 01:22:33.915
Meet the pilot.

01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:38.667
Why did we get married?
Have children? You don't need us.

01:22:39.413 --> 01:22:42.587
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:45.089
But it doesn't love you like we do.

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:55.933
I'm sorry. Really.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:00.275
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:05.030
- Raging Waters?
- Yeah!

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.887
Wait in the car.

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:57.324
Enrique!

01:23:57.533 --> 01:23:59.877
Are you here?

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:16.643
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:24.857
And you... are always like a snake.

01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:28.981
It's great
to see you, Connor!

01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:30.236
I told you I would be back.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:33.159
I knew you would.
It's good to see you.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.202
Jolanda!

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:37.623
Get out here, we got company.
And bring some tequila.

01:24:37.823 --> 01:24:40.952
- Hey, big John. Como te va?
- What's up?

01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:42.877
Who's this big guy?

01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:48.050
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me. He's, er... Uncle Bob.

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.093
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

01:24:50.294 --> 01:24:52.717
Uncle Bob, huh?

01:24:53.297 --> 01:24:55.800
OK. OK!

01:24:57.175 --> 01:24:58.267
How are you?

01:24:58.468 --> 01:25:01.768
How are you?
You've grown so much.

01:25:01.972 --> 01:25:03.474
Drink?

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:09.021
Uncle Bob?

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:14.110
Hey, Sarita! You're pretty
famous, all over the goddamn TV.

01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:16.867
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:19.789
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

01:25:22.701 --> 01:25:23.827
I just came for my stuff.

01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:26.505
I need clothes,
food and one of your trucks.

01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:28.673
How about the fillings
out of my fucking teeth?

01:25:28.874 --> 01:25:31.377
Now, Enrique!

01:25:32.419 --> 01:25:36.219
- You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:59.533
One thing about my mom...

01:26:01.365 --> 01:26:03.493
...she always plans ahead.

01:26:14.044 --> 01:26:15.011
Excellent.

01:26:26.223 --> 01:26:29.773
This is the best truck I got,
but the starter is gone.

01:26:29.976 --> 01:26:32.820
- You got the time to change it out?
- Yeah.

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.944
I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

01:26:35.065 --> 01:26:38.069
Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.988
- You get out tonight too, okay?
- Sure.

01:26:42.489 --> 01:26:45.868
Just drop by any time
and totally fuck up my life.

01:26:51.456 --> 01:26:54.209
See, I grew up in places like this,

01:26:54.543 --> 01:26:57.217
so I thought
that's how people lived:

01:26:57.879 --> 01:27:01.133
riding around in helicopters,

01:27:01.675 --> 01:27:03.769
learning how to blow shit up.

01:27:05.595 --> 01:27:10.351
But then, when my mom got busted,
I got put in a regular school.

01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:14.196
The other kids were into Nintendo.

01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:30.500
Are you ever afraid?

01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:32.043
No.

01:27:36.293 --> 01:27:37.510
Not even of dying?

01:27:38.587 --> 01:27:39.679
No.

01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:48.601
You don't feel any emotion about it
one way or another?

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:51.475
No.
I have to stay functional

01:27:51.725 --> 01:27:53.773
until the mission is complete.

01:27:58.356 --> 01:28:00.324
Then it doesn't matter.

01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:04.367
Yeah. I have to stay functional too.
I'm "too important".

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.597
That's definitely you.

01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:36.979
Most of the guys my mom
hung round with were geeks.

01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:40.862
But there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

01:28:41.066 --> 01:28:44.240
- He taught me engines.
- Hold here.

01:28:45.195 --> 01:28:47.618
Mom screwed it up, of course.

01:28:47.823 --> 01:28:49.871
She'd always tell 'em about
Judgment Day

01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:52.453
and me being this world leader.

01:28:53.245 --> 01:28:57.250
- That'd be all she wrote.
- Torque wrench, please.

01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:00.760
Here.

01:29:01.795 --> 01:29:06.221
- I wish I could've met my real dad.
- You will.

01:29:06.424 --> 01:29:11.021
Yeah, I guess.
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

01:29:12.305 --> 01:29:15.479
I sent him back through time
to 1984.

01:29:16.309 --> 01:29:17.561
Man!

01:29:19.271 --> 01:29:21.569
He hasn't even been born yet.

01:29:23.316 --> 01:29:25.284
It messes with your head.

01:29:27.904 --> 01:29:30.532
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:40.922
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

01:29:41.126 --> 01:29:46.303
She still loves him, I guess.
I see her crying sometimes.

01:29:46.506 --> 01:29:47.928
She denies it totally, of course,

01:29:48.133 --> 01:29:50.932
like she got something
stuck in her eye.

01:29:55.181 --> 01:29:56.683
Why do you cry?

01:29:57.809 --> 01:29:59.607
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:02.280
I don't know. We just cry.

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:05.575
You know, when it hurts.

01:30:11.865 --> 01:30:16.871
- Pain causes it?
- Er... no. It's different.

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:20.048
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyways.

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:21.670
- Get it?
- No.

01:30:23.043 --> 01:30:24.636
All right, my man!

01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:28.056
- No prob/em o-
- Give me five.

01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:32.515
Just put out your hand, like this.

01:30:33.887 --> 01:30:37.608
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:39.855
All right!

01:30:42.771 --> 01:30:45.115
OK, that's good. Up high! High five!

01:30:46.232 --> 01:30:47.358
Five low.

01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:49.069
Too slow.

01:30:52.238 --> 01:30:54.366
I'm just kidding. One more time.

01:30:54.574 --> 01:30:56.668
Good. Now try it. Good!

01:30:56.868 --> 01:30:58.620
Now do me. Give me five.

01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:02.332
'Watching John
with the machine,

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:04.713
it was suddenly so clear.

01:31:04.918 --> 01:31:07.888
'The Terminator would never stop.

01:31:08.088 --> 01:31:11.763
'It would never leave him
and it would never hurt him,

01:31:11.967 --> 01:31:15.392
'never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him

01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:17.893
'or say it was too busy
to spend time with him.

01:31:18.932 --> 01:31:23.654
'It would always be there
and it would die to protect him.

01:31:25.397 --> 01:31:28.401
'Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years,

01:31:28.608 --> 01:31:32.954
'this thing, this machine,
was the only one who measured up.

01:31:33.947 --> 01:31:38.373
'In an insane world,
it was the sanest choice.'

01:32:11.401 --> 01:32:16.248
Come here, darling.

01:33:16.007 --> 01:33:18.226
Hey, let's try this one.

01:33:23.598 --> 01:33:25.145
There we go.

01:35:11.372 --> 01:35:13.795
She said you go south
with him like you planned.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.004
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

01:35:17.212 --> 01:35:18.964
Mom, wait!

01:35:34.437 --> 01:35:36.155
"No fate".

01:35:37.482 --> 01:35:39.701
"No fate, but what we make."

01:35:41.861 --> 01:35:43.488
My father told her this.

01:35:46.491 --> 01:35:51.088
I mean, I made him memorise it
in the future as a message to her.

01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:57.507
Never mind.
Now, OK, the whole thing goes...

01:35:57.710 --> 01:36:00.338
The future's not set.

01:36:00.546 --> 01:36:03.971
There's no fate,
but what we make for ourselves.

01:36:04.175 --> 01:36:08.681
- She intends to change the future.
- Yeah, I guess.

01:36:10.139 --> 01:36:11.857
Oh, shit!

01:36:12.058 --> 01:36:13.856
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:17.439
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

01:36:17.647 --> 01:36:19.524
She's gonna blow him away.

01:36:19.732 --> 01:36:21.609
Come on! Let's go!

01:36:21.818 --> 01:36:23.491
Let's go! Come on!

01:36:34.247 --> 01:36:37.251
- This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:41.213
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do. It knows what I know.

01:36:41.421 --> 01:36:45.927
- It might anticipate this move.
- I don't care. We gotta stop her.

01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:48.512
Killing Dyson might prevent the war.

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.438
I don't care!

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:52.436
Haven't you learned anything yet?

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.813
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

01:36:57.687 --> 01:37:00.531
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die.

01:37:00.773 --> 01:37:03.822
But everybody's not like that!
We have feelings.

01:37:04.027 --> 01:37:05.950
We hurt. We're afraid.

01:37:08.531 --> 01:37:12.786
You gotta learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.080
Danny, I told you
to go to bed. I'm not kidding.

01:37:53.284 --> 01:37:55.286
Just a couple of minutes,
Mom!

01:38:12.637 --> 01:38:14.810
Danny, your time is up.

01:38:14.972 --> 01:38:17.691
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

01:38:46.337 --> 01:38:47.554
Danny!

01:38:49.006 --> 01:38:50.633
Ugh!

01:38:59.308 --> 01:39:03.063
- Daddy!
- Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:05.819
Miles?

01:39:09.569 --> 01:39:10.991
Miles!

01:39:11.195 --> 01:39:13.493
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

01:39:20.705 --> 01:39:22.628
Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!

01:39:22.832 --> 01:39:23.958
Run!

01:39:24.167 --> 01:39:25.794
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

01:39:45.146 --> 01:39:47.240
Daddy!
' Danny! Danny!

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.944
- Nobody fucking move!
- Don't hurt my daddy!

01:39:51.152 --> 01:39:54.827
Get down on the floor, bitch.
Get down now!

01:39:55.031 --> 01:39:56.783
Get out of the way.

01:39:56.991 --> 01:39:58.584
Don't hurt him!

01:40:00.286 --> 01:40:01.833
Get on the floor now!

01:40:04.123 --> 01:40:06.592
Just let the boy go.

01:40:06.792 --> 01:40:09.636
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:12.306
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

01:40:12.507 --> 01:40:14.635
- It's all your fault!
- What?

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:16.844
I'm not gonna let you do it.

01:40:35.488 --> 01:40:36.614
Shhh!

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:42.085
Shhh.

01:41:08.938 --> 01:41:11.316
Shit! We're too late!

01:41:15.528 --> 01:41:16.529
Check them.

01:41:20.241 --> 01:41:23.745
Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?

01:41:24.704 --> 01:41:26.251
Look at me.

01:41:28.249 --> 01:41:30.217
I almost...

01:41:30.418 --> 01:41:32.341
I almost...

01:41:42.138 --> 01:41:46.188
It'll be OK. It's gonna be OK.
We'll figure something out. OK?

01:41:48.144 --> 01:41:49.487
I promise.

01:41:53.357 --> 01:41:58.534
- You came here to stop me.
- Yeah, I did.

01:42:01.616 --> 01:42:03.414
I love you, John.

01:42:05.328 --> 01:42:07.422
I always have.

01:42:08.873 --> 01:42:10.716
I know.

01:42:17.173 --> 01:42:19.221
Deep penetration.

01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:22.766
No shattered bone.

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:25.769
You hold here. The pressure
should stop the bleeding.

01:42:36.692 --> 01:42:39.866
- Who are you people?
- Show him.

01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:47.207
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

01:43:00.257 --> 01:43:03.386
Oh, God! No!

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:18.154
Oh, my God!

01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:28.912
Oh, my God.

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:31.589
Now, listen to me very carefully.

01:43:33.999 --> 01:43:37.378
Nuclear winter effects
caused massive cooling...

01:43:37.586 --> 01:43:41.636
'Dyson listened while
the Terminator laid it all down.

01:43:41.841 --> 01:43:45.436
'Skynet. Judgment Day.

'He took it pretty well.'

01:43:59.150 --> 01:44:01.744
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

01:44:08.242 --> 01:44:12.839
You're judging me
on things I haven't even done yet.

01:44:16.584 --> 01:44:19.212
How were we supposed to know?

01:44:21.297 --> 01:44:22.924
Yeah!

01:44:23.132 --> 01:44:24.634
Right.

01:44:25.551 --> 01:44:28.646
How were you supposed to know?

Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

Men like you thought it up.

01:44:40.649 --> 01:44:43.698
You think you're so creative.

01:44:43.903 --> 01:44:46.952
You don't know what it's like
to really create something,

01:44:47.156 --> 01:44:50.751
to create a life,
to feel it growing inside you.

01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:53.204
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

01:44:53.412 --> 01:44:54.789
Mom!

01:44:55.748 --> 01:44:59.378
We need to be a little more
constructive here. OK?

01:44:59.585 --> 01:45:01.553
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

01:45:01.754 --> 01:45:03.472
But I thought...

01:45:04.673 --> 01:45:08.519
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

01:45:08.719 --> 01:45:12.269
That's right. There's no way
I'm gonna finish the new processor.

01:45:12.473 --> 01:45:15.147
Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.

01:45:15.351 --> 01:45:18.946
- I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
- That's not good enough.

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:22.150
- No one must follow your work.
- Right.

01:45:23.234 --> 01:45:27.080
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab:

01:45:27.279 --> 01:45:31.705
the files, the disk drives,
everything, everything here.

01:45:32.535 --> 01:45:35.379
Everything. I don't care.

01:45:37.373 --> 01:45:38.169
The chip.

01:45:38.791 --> 01:45:40.338
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

01:45:40.543 --> 01:45:42.045
They keep it in a vault
at Cyberdyne.

01:45:42.253 --> 01:45:43.505
It must be from
the other one like you.

01:45:43.712 --> 01:45:48.092
- The CPU from the first Terminator.
- Son of a bitch! I knew it!

01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:50.894
They told us
not to ask where they got it.

01:45:51.095 --> 01:45:53.314
Those lying motherfuckers.

01:45:53.514 --> 01:45:55.187
It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.

01:45:55.391 --> 01:45:57.519
I mean,
it was smashed, it didn't work,

01:45:57.726 --> 01:45:59.103
but it gave us ideas,

01:45:59.311 --> 01:46:02.190
took us in new directions,
things we would've never th...

01:46:04.441 --> 01:46:06.443
All my work was based on it.

01:46:06.652 --> 01:46:08.325
It must be destroyed.

01:46:10.656 --> 01:46:13.626
Can you get us in? Past security?

01:46:13.826 --> 01:46:16.750
I think so, yeah. When?

01:46:20.791 --> 01:46:21.758
Now?

01:46:26.005 --> 01:46:28.679
'The future,
always so clear to me,

01:46:28.883 --> 01:46:31.807
'had become
like a black highway at night.

01:46:32.011 --> 01:46:37.563
'We were in uncharted territory now,
making up history as we went along.'

01:47:13.010 --> 01:47:17.516
Hi. Er... Carl, right?

01:47:19.266 --> 01:47:21.109
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

01:47:21.518 --> 01:47:22.360
Hi!

01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:24.647
...take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

01:47:24.855 --> 01:47:28.029
Mr Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

01:47:28.233 --> 01:47:30.235
I need written authorisation...

01:47:31.445 --> 01:47:35.166
- I insist.
- Don't even think about it.

01:47:46.126 --> 01:47:47.673
Come on. It's OK.

01:47:49.088 --> 01:47:50.465
It takes two keys to open the vault.

01:47:50.673 --> 01:47:52.266
They have
to be turned simultaneously.

01:47:52.466 --> 01:47:55.140
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

01:47:56.762 --> 01:47:58.014
Gibbons?

01:48:01.266 --> 01:48:05.942
Gibbons! Come on, man!
You can't leave the desk like that!

01:48:08.232 --> 01:48:09.484
Gibbons!

01:48:10.985 --> 01:48:12.282
Oh, shit.

01:48:30.254 --> 01:48:32.302
My card should access this.

01:48:36.010 --> 01:48:38.138
- What? What is it?
- Damn it.

01:48:39.388 --> 01:48:41.186
The silent alarm's been tripped.

01:48:47.312 --> 01:48:50.111
It's neutralised all the codes
in the entire building.

01:48:50.315 --> 01:48:53.910
Nothing will open anywhere now.
We have to abort.

01:48:55.154 --> 01:48:56.576
No.

01:48:58.282 --> 01:49:01.456
We go all the way. OK?

01:49:03.746 --> 01:49:07.421
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

01:49:07.624 --> 01:49:09.046
I think it's that guy from the mall.

01:49:09.251 --> 01:49:10.173
It is!

01:49:10.377 --> 01:49:12.550
It's him and the woman.

01:49:13.881 --> 01:49:16.725
Look, just send everything
you got in the area right now.

01:49:19.303 --> 01:49:22.557
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

01:49:27.227 --> 01:49:29.400
- It's no good.
- Let me try mine.

01:49:34.651 --> 01:49:36.619
John, fire in the hold!

01:49:48.791 --> 01:49:53.467
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the halon system.

01:50:00.761 --> 01:50:03.105
You have
to wait until the gas clears.

01:50:05.724 --> 01:50:06.850
Put this on.

01:50:21.115 --> 01:50:23.368
All right, let's get to work.

01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:48.229
All units in the vicinity,
all units able to respond:

01:50:48.433 --> 01:50:52.939
A 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer
Street, the Cyberdyne building.

01:50:53.272 --> 01:50:55.195
Suspect 1 is white, female,

01:50:55.399 --> 01:50:58.403
identified as: last name Connor,
first name Sarah,

01:50:58.610 --> 01:51:01.238
escaped from
Pescadero State Hospital.

01:51:01.738 --> 01:51:03.035
Suspect 2: white, male...

01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:11.377
All the disks in my office. All the
disks in that office over there.

01:51:11.623 --> 01:51:13.591
Everything behind my desk.

01:51:13.834 --> 01:51:15.836
All the processors on my left.

01:51:16.086 --> 01:51:18.339
We'll blow it up with the CP4.

01:51:32.144 --> 01:51:33.521
Could I...

01:51:34.021 --> 01:51:35.568
Excuse me...

01:51:37.774 --> 01:51:39.902
Could I borrow that thing?

01:51:49.244 --> 01:51:51.667
I worked a lot
of years on this thing.

01:51:55.709 --> 01:51:59.964
- Give me that location again.
- 2111, Kramer.

01:52:00.214 --> 01:52:03.844
The suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.

01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:56.733
All right!

01:52:56.937 --> 01:52:58.564
7-2-5-6.

01:53:00.148 --> 01:53:01.070
Yes!

01:53:05.862 --> 01:53:07.159
Easy money.

01:53:11.952 --> 01:53:13.295
Uh-oh.

01:53:15.998 --> 01:53:18.296
Oh, shit! Not good.

01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:19.672
Not good!

01:53:23.505 --> 01:53:26.759
- How we doing?
- Primer cord is set.

01:53:26.967 --> 01:53:29.220
One more barrel, two more minutes.

01:53:31.263 --> 01:53:36.110
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:38.563
Piece of cake.

01:53:38.770 --> 01:53:40.192
- We got company.
- Police?

01:53:40.397 --> 01:53:43.617
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

01:53:43.817 --> 01:53:45.740
Go. I'll finish here.

01:53:47.195 --> 01:53:48.492
Come on.

01:53:49.698 --> 01:53:52.872
- I'll take care of the police.
- Wait! You swore!

01:53:55.996 --> 01:53:57.248
Trust me.

01:54:10.677 --> 01:54:12.554
'You at the window!

01:54:12.763 --> 01:54:15.733
'Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!'

01:54:17.184 --> 01:54:20.484
- Holy shit!
- That's a damn mini-gun!

01:54:42.959 --> 01:54:45.132
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

01:54:45.337 --> 01:54:46.714
Go! Go! Go!

01:55:34.428 --> 01:55:35.805
Fire!

01:55:53.113 --> 01:55:54.865
We go same time, to the left.

01:55:55.073 --> 01:55:57.667
One, two, three, go.

01:56:09.588 --> 01:56:12.137
All right, in order to get that out,
you have to...

01:56:19.848 --> 01:56:23.478
We got Skynet by the balls now,
don't we? Come on, let's book.

01:56:24.853 --> 01:56:26.196
Hold your fire!

01:56:51.838 --> 01:56:54.091
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

01:56:57.594 --> 01:57:00.222
Time to go. Now.

01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:03.229
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

01:57:03.433 --> 01:57:06.403
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

01:57:31.002 --> 01:57:33.425
Mom! Mom!

01:58:11.376 --> 01:58:13.003
Aagh!

01:58:18.091 --> 01:58:18.887
Shit!

01:58:20.468 --> 01:58:23.347
Shit! She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

01:58:33.523 --> 01:58:34.399
Get down!

01:58:41.656 --> 01:58:42.908
Here.

01:59:08.642 --> 01:59:11.441
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

01:59:16.274 --> 01:59:18.993
Fall back! Everybody out!

01:59:19.194 --> 01:59:20.946
Fall back now! Go! Go! Go!

01:59:57.107 --> 01:59:58.324
'We got a war zone
down here!

02:00:30.765 --> 02:00:32.267
Shut your eyes.

02:00:38.732 --> 02:00:41.736
Stay here. I'll be back.

02:00:49.951 --> 02:00:51.874
Get down on the floor, face down!

02:00:55.123 --> 02:00:56.170
Down on the floor now!

02:00:58.668 --> 02:01:00.011
OK, drop him!

02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:39.717
Agh!

02:02:20.041 --> 02:02:21.793
Here, hold this.

02:02:34.097 --> 02:02:35.895
I think it's him!

02:02:38.268 --> 02:02:39.736
Holy shit!

02:02:55.368 --> 02:02:56.244
Go!

02:03:35.325 --> 02:03:36.417
Shit!

02:03:49.505 --> 02:03:50.882
Get out.

02:03:53.343 --> 02:03:54.845
Aagh!

02:04:10.234 --> 02:04:14.034
Listen. No matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

02:04:14.238 --> 02:04:15.660
- You got it?
- Yeah.

02:04:15.865 --> 02:04:17.367
All right.

02:04:31.589 --> 02:04:33.887
- Chopper's coming in!
- It's him.

02:05:31.816 --> 02:05:33.033
Yeah!

02:05:35.403 --> 02:05:37.076
John! Stay down!

02:06:02.722 --> 02:06:04.190
Aagh!
" Mom!

02:06:45.348 --> 02:06:46.224
Hello?

02:06:52.313 --> 02:06:54.407
Goddamn! You all right...?

02:07:01.948 --> 02:07:03.916
Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.

02:07:06.410 --> 02:07:08.162
- Take the shotgun.
- OK.

02:07:10.289 --> 02:07:11.085
- Agh!

02:07:12.208 --> 02:07:13.425
Are you hurt?

02:07:26.264 --> 02:07:30.064
- Holy shit! Come on, Mom. Come on!
- We need your truck.

02:07:30.768 --> 02:07:31.610
Hurry!

02:07:36.774 --> 02:07:39.618
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

02:07:40.361 --> 02:07:43.365
Come on! Go!

02:07:49.495 --> 02:07:51.372
What the hell...?

02:07:57.837 --> 02:08:00.010
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

02:08:02.008 --> 02:08:03.305
Here. This'll work.

02:08:09.599 --> 02:08:11.351
He's gaining.

02:08:13.311 --> 02:08:16.110
- Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

02:08:16.314 --> 02:08:18.362
I can run faster than this!

02:08:28.701 --> 02:08:29.998
Coming up, to the right.

02:08:32.663 --> 02:08:34.006
Watch it! Watch it!

02:08:56.938 --> 02:08:58.690
- Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

02:09:06.572 --> 02:09:08.119
Take the off-ramp.

02:09:18.167 --> 02:09:18.963
Shit!

02:09:23.005 --> 02:09:23.881
Hold on!

02:10:09.885 --> 02:10:10.681
Don't stop!

02:10:19.437 --> 02:10:20.609
Go straight!

02:10:22.690 --> 02:10:24.158
- Look out!
- Duck!

02:10:39.415 --> 02:10:40.917
Get the hell outta here!

02:10:46.881 --> 02:10:49.555
Get outta here! Let's go!

02:12:06.752 --> 02:12:08.925
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

02:12:59.013 --> 02:12:59.980
We don't have much time.

02:13:23.078 --> 02:13:23.874
Let's go.

02:13:25.164 --> 02:13:26.711
Come on, Mom.
We gotta get outta here.

02:13:26.916 --> 02:13:28.884
Come on! Get up!

02:13:42.765 --> 02:13:44.187
Hand me the shotgun.

02:13:49.146 --> 02:13:51.274
Put your weight on me, Mom.

02:13:52.358 --> 02:13:53.985
Hurry!

02:13:57.696 --> 02:13:59.198
Come on, Mom.

02:14:05.788 --> 02:14:08.007
- Agh!
- Come on, Mom. Get up! Come on!

02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:39.947
This way. Come on!

02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:12.109
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

02:15:12.313 --> 02:15:13.439
Go back.

02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:23.908
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

02:15:24.533 --> 02:15:26.001
John, you've got to go now.

02:15:26.201 --> 02:15:28.203
- John!
- Go! Now!

02:15:28.412 --> 02:15:29.755
No!

02:16:43.028 --> 02:16:44.655
Get up the steps.

02:16:46.656 --> 02:16:47.829
Go on.

02:16:54.289 --> 02:16:56.290
Come on, Mom.
I got you. Come on.

02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:22.696
No!

02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:33.170
Grab the chain. Grab it.

02:17:34.538 --> 02:17:37.165
Grab it. Go. Go!

02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:50.805
Mom, come on! Mom! Mom!

02:17:51.013 --> 02:17:52.481
Come on!

02:17:53.389 --> 02:17:54.983
Mom!

02:17:55.183 --> 02:17:57.357
Mom! Mom! Mom!

02:18:33.430 --> 02:18:34.852
Agh!

02:18:40.478 --> 02:18:41.401
Call to John.

02:18:43.397 --> 02:18:44.523
No!

02:18:45.066 --> 02:18:46.284
I know this hurts.

02:18:47.277 --> 02:18:49.745
- Ugh!
- Call John.

02:19:07.172 --> 02:19:09.094
Call to John now.

02:19:11.218 --> 02:19:12.514
Fuck you!

02:22:24.327 --> 02:22:27.877
John? John!

02:22:29.249 --> 02:22:31.468
John? Help!

02:22:34.212 --> 02:22:35.589
John!

02:22:39.384 --> 02:22:41.057
John?

02:22:43.388 --> 02:22:44.731
John!

02:22:46.850 --> 02:22:48.067
John.

02:22:49.019 --> 02:22:50.521
John.

02:22:53.106 --> 02:22:54.733
- Mom.
- Help me.

02:22:56.026 --> 02:22:57.778
Help me.

02:22:59.321 --> 02:23:00.322
Help me.

02:23:00.530 --> 02:23:01.656
Out of the way, John!

02:23:05.243 --> 02:23:06.119
<i>Shoo“</i>

02:23:49.871 --> 02:23:51.293
Mom!

02:24:01.049 --> 02:24:02.517
Get down!

02:24:34.249 --> 02:24:35.717
No!

02:25:36.895 --> 02:25:39.114
Get up. Come on.

02:25:41.316 --> 02:25:42.863
Holy shit!

02:25:43.068 --> 02:25:44.741
I need a vacation.

02:25:59.251 --> 02:26:02.926
- Is it dead?
- Terminated.

02:26:06.466 --> 02:26:08.059
Will this melt in there?

02:26:11.304 --> 02:26:12.897
Yes. Throw it in.

02:26:17.769 --> 02:26:18.611
<i>A 070's!</i>

02:26:20.647 --> 02:26:22.820
And the chip.

02:26:37.289 --> 02:26:38.711
It's over.

02:26:41.251 --> 02:26:42.298
No.

02:26:45.839 --> 02:26:47.216
There's one more chip.

02:26:52.220 --> 02:26:54.188
And it must be destroyed also.

02:26:59.853 --> 02:27:01.230
Here.

02:27:01.438 --> 02:27:05.443
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

02:27:11.072 --> 02:27:12.619
No.

02:27:13.908 --> 02:27:14.704
No.

02:27:18.079 --> 02:27:20.457
- I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.
- No!

02:27:20.665 --> 02:27:22.667
No, it'll be OK. Stay with us.

02:27:22.876 --> 02:27:24.753
- It'll be OK.
- I have to go away.

02:27:24.961 --> 02:27:27.430
No, don't do it. Please, don't go.

02:27:27.630 --> 02:27:30.383
- I must go away, John.
- No!

02:27:31.051 --> 02:27:32.143
No, wait.

02:27:32.344 --> 02:27:35.097
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry.

02:27:36.264 --> 02:27:38.312
No, don't do it! Don't go!

02:27:38.767 --> 02:27:40.314
It has to end here.

02:27:41.644 --> 02:27:44.818
I order you not to go!
I order you not to go!

02:27:45.023 --> 02:27:46.525
I order you not to go!

02:27:53.073 --> 02:27:54.825
I know now why you cry.

02:27:57.327 --> 02:27:59.500
But it's something I can never do.

02:28:34.614 --> 02:28:36.207
Good bye.

02:30:15.673 --> 02:30:19.894
<i>August 29, 1997, came and went.</i>

02:30:20.220 --> 02:30:21.847
<i>Nothing much happened.</i>

02:30:22.055 --> 02:30:24.308
<i>Michael Jackson turned 40.</i>

02:30:24.724 --> 02:30:26.317
<i>There was no Judgment Day.</i>

02:30:27.310 --> 02:30:29.904
<i>People went to work
as they always do.</i>

02:30:30.271 --> 02:30:31.898
<i>Laughed, complained,</i>

<i>watched TV, made love.</i>

02:30:35.902 --> 02:30:38.155
<i>I wanted to run
through the street yelling</i>

02:30:38.363 --> 02:30:39.956
<i>to grab them all and say,</i>

02:30:40.198 --> 02:30:43.577
<i>(( Every day

<i>Instead, I got drunk.</i>

02:30:48.540 --> 02:30:50.918
<i>That was 30 years ago.</i>

02:30:51.459 --> 02:30:55.680
But the dark future which never came
still exists for me.

02:30:56.172 --> 02:30:59.551
And it always will,
like the traces of a dream.

02:31:02.178 --> 02:31:05.603
John fights the war differently
than it was foretold.

02:31:06.099 --> 02:31:08.477
Here, on the battlefield
of the Senate

02:31:08.851 --> 02:31:11.024
his weapons are common sense

02:31:11.980 --> 02:31:13.072
and hope.

02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:17.743
Tie me, Grandma. Tie me!

02:31:25.285 --> 02:31:26.127
How's that?

02:31:26.327 --> 02:31:27.203
Thank you, Grandma.

02:31:31.416 --> 02:31:33.009
<i>The luxury of hope</i>
