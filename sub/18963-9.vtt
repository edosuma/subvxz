00:55.756 --> 00:56.756
Zelda!

00:59.760 --> 01:00.794
Zelda!

01:06.934 --> 01:09.237
- Zelda.
- Hello, baby.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.540
Mama.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.475
Ohh.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.844
Daddy.
What are you doin' here?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.412
Oh, a surprise.

01:18.479 --> 01:19.847
You're supposed to be
at Tildy's.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.949
Oh, she sends her love.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.152
Her new baby's a crier.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.723
Come on in.
It's like Grand Central
around here.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.592
My, what a lovely house.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.261
Where did you find this place?

01:33.327 --> 01:35.296
It's in the middle of nowhere.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.565
The roads in this state
are abysmal.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.533
- Now, dear.
- No, you're right, Daddy.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.702
They are awfully bumpy.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.712
Well, hate to drunk and run.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.014
- Love you, Zelda, honey.
- And I actually have to work.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.383
Oh, bye.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.818
Roaring good party.
See you next weekend.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.020
Bye.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.689
Friends, up from the city.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.457
They, uh, have to
get back for work.

02:03.524 --> 02:07.428
Uh, so it's proof that
all roads lead to Westport.

02:07.495 --> 02:10.330
The Sayres from Montgomery
are at our door.

02:10.398 --> 02:11.665
They just surprised us.

02:11.732 --> 02:14.435
Yes, that'd be
Mrs. Sayre.

02:14.502 --> 02:18.372
And the right honorable
Judge Anthony Sayre.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.741
This is the right
honorable Tana.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.844
Houseboy, chief cook,
bartender and...

02:24.945 --> 02:26.680
All out master of many trades.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.982
I'm sincerely happy to
make your acquaintance.

02:29.049 --> 02:33.387
- Thank you.
- Uh, very nice to
meet you, too.

02:33.454 --> 02:36.089
Tana has been so helpful, Daddy.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.292
Really a Godsend.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.962
He's from the Japanese
Reliable Employment Agency.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.597
Japanese what?

02:43.664 --> 02:45.933
Tildy said you needed
a few things,

02:45.999 --> 02:47.301
some sheets, some towels.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.969
Oh, yes, thank you, Mama.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.304
- Uh, Scott.
- Yes?

02:50.371 --> 02:52.039
Would you take Mama
and the bags upstairs.

02:52.105 --> 02:55.142
Oh, certainly. Tana,
can you show Mrs. Sayre
up to the guest room.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.278
Sweetheart.
I asked you.

02:57.345 --> 03:00.514
Yes, but this is exactly
the sort of thing that
Tana excels at.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.816
- Yes, of course it is, but...
- It's fine, Zelda.

03:02.883 --> 03:06.854
- Gives me a chance
to get to know...
- This way please, missus.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.828
Daddy, let me take your jacket.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.431
No, I'm fine.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.066
Where's the lavatory?

03:19.132 --> 03:20.468
It's right through there.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.477
Why are you being like this?

03:29.543 --> 03:33.180
I know you're upset
about Max and the diary...

03:33.281 --> 03:35.148
My parents are here.

03:35.283 --> 03:36.950
What are they gonna
think about all this?

03:37.017 --> 03:39.420
This is the first time
they've seen us married.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.121
Firs time they seen us
in a home.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.757
Since when did you care
what they think?

03:43.824 --> 03:45.426
Your father hates me.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.127
They didn't want to
come to the wedding.

03:47.194 --> 03:48.738
They didn't even
see you off at the train.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.297
You might not want to claim them

03:50.298 --> 03:52.566
like you claim
everything else about me,

03:52.633 --> 03:54.468
but they are still my parents.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.615
When my daddy gets
out of the bathroom,

03:58.639 --> 04:00.641
the least you can do
is offer him a drink.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.638
Mrs. Sayre, please,
come this way.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.678
Borrow this towel?
It's okay, it's okay.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.753
I will make you some tea.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.761
You, pry this sorry ass
up off of here

04:53.827 --> 04:57.364
and call a cab.
Call lots of cabs.

04:57.365 --> 05:00.401
I got another one
for you over here.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.370
- Tallulah, Eugenia...
- Hmm?

05:02.403 --> 05:05.205
Can you please get rid of, uh...

05:05.272 --> 05:08.709
- Who is that?
- Not Scott Joplin,
I can tell you that.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.711
My parents,

05:10.778 --> 05:12.846
Mama and the judge
have decided to surprise us.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.915
- They're here?
- Oh, glory be, what fun.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.393
No, no. We've gotta
clear this place out.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.218
They'll be horrified.

05:18.285 --> 05:20.854
Oh, yes,
perhaps this is a bit
trop pour la famille.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.991
We'll help you, Zelda.
Anything for a
Montgomery sister.

05:24.057 --> 05:27.461
Gird your loins, Beadsie.
We can handle the piano man.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.996
Thank you.

05:30.731 --> 05:36.103
Tell him, Max.
20,000 copies sold
in the first two weeks.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.169
Yes, indeed.

05:37.204 --> 05:39.306
Sounds quite good.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.475
Yes. I do tell Max,
however,

05:41.542 --> 05:43.411
that the next printing
should be larger.

05:43.444 --> 05:46.747
And I tell our authors
they should stick to
the writing.

05:46.814 --> 05:50.150
Well, what other authors
do you work with, Mr. Perkins?

05:50.217 --> 05:52.219
Henry James.
Edith Wharton.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.022
Oh, my goodness,
those are two of our
finest writers.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.858
I certainly enjoyed
"The Portrait of a Lady"

05:57.925 --> 06:00.761
and Henry James, he is a genius.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.830
- Some of my favorites.
- Ah, Vincent.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.198
Here, let me introduce you
to my father-in-law.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.868
And I really must be going.
Good to meet you, Judge Sayre.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.670
Likewise, Mr. Perkins.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.139
- Pages, my boy, pages.
- Yes.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.507
Call me.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.208
Judge Anthony Sayre,

06:15.275 --> 06:18.111
the poet
Edna St. Vincent Millay.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.849
- Pleasure.
- Entirely mine.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.686
Townsend, would you please help?

06:25.753 --> 06:27.555
These guests are like cicadas,

06:27.621 --> 06:29.790
loud and shrill and
constantly under foot.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.358
We have to get rid of them.

06:31.459 --> 06:34.528
Of course I will help,
just as soon as I finish
this batch.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.565
Damnit, Townsend.
No one cares about pancakes.

06:38.932 --> 06:39.867
What?

06:39.933 --> 06:42.670
You know what I mean.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.638
I know you're wrong.
I think people care

06:44.705 --> 06:46.039
a great deal about pancakes.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.576
- Oh, you do, do you?
- Um, yes, I do. Yes.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.143
Yes, yes, I do.

06:52.145 --> 06:56.850
So, you come down to
these kinds of parties
often then, do you?

06:59.019 --> 07:02.089
Yes. I thought so.

07:03.491 --> 07:04.492
Excuse me?

07:04.558 --> 07:06.560
Your poetic soul.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.762
I saw it the moment we met.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.331
Not something all men have.

07:11.398 --> 07:14.602
When one does, one does.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.637
Do you know what I mean?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.942
I should join my wife.

07:22.009 --> 07:27.180
Perhaps, yet,
should she not be allowed
a journey of her own?

07:28.982 --> 07:32.720
Well, again, it, uh,
was a pleasure to meet you.

07:34.354 --> 07:37.591
Bid adieu to your
darling daughter,
won't you?

07:43.330 --> 07:45.532
You're the one
that was bored,
remember, Zelda?

07:45.533 --> 07:48.301
"Well, let's invite
everyone out,
let's have a party."

07:48.368 --> 07:50.246
- Yes, but I do think...
- All I wanted to do
was write.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.371
This is what you wanted.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.373
Scott, my parents are here.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.043
What does it matter
what I might have wanted
a week ago?

07:56.109 --> 07:58.245
What is wrong with you?

07:59.379 --> 08:00.748
Where's Daddy?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.558
Daddy.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.893
Daddy.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.061
Daddy, wait.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.835
Daddy.
I'm so sorry.

08:23.303 --> 08:26.139
I don't know how a person,
much less my own daughter,

08:26.206 --> 08:27.206
can live like this.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.109
We don't live like this.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.578
It's just a few friends.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.714
Oh, there's nothing few
or friends about it.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.818
I know you didn't want
a life in Montgomery,

08:37.885 --> 08:41.054
but I could never
have imagined
you wanted this.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.590
I don't want this.

08:43.591 --> 08:47.594
We came here because
Scott needed to write.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.597
Yeah, you call that writing?

08:49.663 --> 08:51.599
No, no, of course not.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.100
But I was so...

08:55.736 --> 08:57.470
It was just so quiet.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.607
What are you
talking about, quiet?

08:59.673 --> 09:02.009
Scott's really tryin'.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.077
He is really tryin'.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.413
And I am, too.
We have the water and...

09:06.479 --> 09:09.382
I love it.
I swim every day.

09:09.449 --> 09:12.620
I thought, oh,
that's where I belong.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.521
But then I have to come out.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.925
I have to come out, don't I?

09:17.991 --> 09:22.195
Oh, yes, yes, of course, you do.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.431
People come out of things.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.266
People come out of things,
don't they?

09:29.436 --> 09:32.339
Well, you'll always have us.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.746
And I'll always have Scott.

09:42.049 --> 09:46.954
Maybe...
Maybe you could, uh,
talk to him later.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.176
Oh, Tallulah, Eugenia.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.478
It's sensational.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.114
- What's it called again?
- Between the Sheets.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.549
Oh, well, this is
just what I needed.

10:17.918 --> 10:21.722
Oh, it is so comforting
to be among friends.

10:21.789 --> 10:25.258
Montgomery certainly
misses you two.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.094
That'll have to be
their cross to bear,

10:27.160 --> 10:29.562
because I do not miss
Montgomery.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.964
I do.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.133
- God, Beadsie.
- I do.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.268
I miss everything
about the south.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.504
The humidity is
so much better for my skin.

10:37.570 --> 10:40.373
The gentlemen are more...
gentlemanly.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.175
I prefer the north.

10:42.242 --> 10:45.278
Women are far more beguiling.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.014
Well, how curious.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.982
I have no experience with them.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.184
You're missing
everything, darling.

10:51.251 --> 10:55.055
Oh, then I suppose I shall
have to get to know some.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.655
Here, here.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.827
Here, here.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.998
Mm.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.233
Mm.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.904
I haven't thrown a dart
since I was a young man.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.073
It's like riding a bicycle.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.889
So, did Zelda mention
the family supper?

11:28.956 --> 11:32.259
Yes. Yes, she did.

11:32.325 --> 11:35.428
Just the four of us, I'm told.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.998
My wife will be pleased.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.769
So, this is where
you come to work,

11:41.835 --> 11:44.137
or write, I should say.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.807
Yes.

11:46.874 --> 11:49.476
And, uh, how is that going?

11:51.578 --> 11:53.146
Well...

11:53.213 --> 11:56.683
We came every bit as much
for Zelda.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.685
She loves the water, you know.

11:58.786 --> 12:03.356
I guess there's real value
in that arrangement then,
isn't there?

12:05.625 --> 12:08.228
There's only real value,
your honor,

12:08.295 --> 12:09.296
in doing things.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.932
Mm-hm, doing things.

12:11.999 --> 12:16.603
Yes, for instance,
writing a novel.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.471
Well, I am the only judge

12:18.538 --> 12:20.173
in the history of
the state of Alabama

12:20.240 --> 12:22.209
who has never been overruled,

12:22.275 --> 12:24.677
and frankly, it eludes me

12:24.812 --> 12:27.314
how indulging in
scribbling something

12:27.380 --> 12:29.917
maybe a few thousand people
will read

12:29.983 --> 12:32.719
measures up to those rulings.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.822
Rulings which will
stand the test of time.

12:37.657 --> 12:40.027
Well, you were right.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.962
Just like riding a bicycle.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.406
So, you don't think my novel
will stand the test of time?

12:54.942 --> 12:58.078
Well, I couldn't say.
I haven't read it.

13:05.853 --> 13:08.155
I just never knew how much fun

13:08.221 --> 13:10.257
Tallulah and Eugenia could be.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.092
They asked me if
I wanted to join them

13:12.159 --> 13:13.994
for an after dinner liqueur.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.328
Why, I don't know.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.697
Well, you're havin' fun,
Mama, why not?

13:17.764 --> 13:22.035
Yes, why not drink
as much and as often
as you can?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.140
We should get started.
It's getting late.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.309
No, we should wait.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.179
- Hey, Fitz.
- Yes, give me a minute.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.682
You don't have to wait on me.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.350
It's a family dinner.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.921
Well, in that case, cheers.

13:42.622 --> 13:46.359
What, uh, glorious bounty
are we to feast upon tonight,
Tana?

13:46.426 --> 13:50.563
Crown roast of lamb,
roasted potatoes,
and baby carrots.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.665
Shall I serve?

13:52.732 --> 13:53.800
Oh, goodness, yes.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.003
I think we're all ready.
Right?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.344
I hope we don't run out.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.047
Never, darling.

14:07.114 --> 14:10.483
From this day forth,
to have and to hold,

14:10.550 --> 14:13.386
I promise to always
keep you in gin.

14:14.922 --> 14:17.057
If ever there was
a promise to keep.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.327
Thank you, Mr. Tana.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.930
It's Tana,
not Mr. Tana.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.832
Just being respectful.

14:25.933 --> 14:29.436
Well, there's
nothing respectful
in being wrong.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.205
I do not mind,
Mr. Scott.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.974
Daddy's just tryin' to be nice.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.109
If Daddy wanted to be nice,

14:36.176 --> 14:37.344
he could have read my book.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.952
Could you pass the carrots
please, Scott?

14:44.985 --> 14:46.954
Scott, the carrots.

14:46.987 --> 14:47.987
What about them?

14:48.021 --> 14:49.489
That's enough.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.191
It is more than enough.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.093
- Oh, dear, please don't.
- Well, it is.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.529
He just keeps on drinking
and flying off the handle.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.299
I'm not gonna be
flying anywhere with this.

14:59.366 --> 15:03.003
Tana, can you get the gin
in the cabinet, please?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.637
Scott, please.

15:04.704 --> 15:05.972
That'll be all, Tana.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.074
Thank you.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.109
Why are you sending Tana away?

15:09.176 --> 15:10.978
You didn't want to do
any of this.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.282
Fine, I'll get it myself.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.417
We have to stop this,
both of us.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.120
No, we don't.
We're just getting started.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.990
- Damnit all, Scott.
- Zelda, please, honey.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.392
- Just put it down.
- What are you doing?

15:25.458 --> 15:26.993
Scott, stop it.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.361
Both of you sit down.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.196
Zelda, honey.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.697
Just give me the bottle!

15:30.763 --> 15:31.864
Fine!

15:33.200 --> 15:34.801
Zelda, are you all right?

15:34.867 --> 15:36.012
- Zelda.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.204
Stop it.

15:49.682 --> 15:53.053
You need me to
write this one up
in my diary for ya,

15:53.120 --> 15:55.688
or you think you got
this covered on your own?

16:30.257 --> 16:31.257
Oh.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.944
They're gonna use each other up.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.287
Mama.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.124
Daddy.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.176
They're gone, Scott.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.878
My parents are gone.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.347
What?

18:00.413 --> 18:02.749
They didn't even stay
the goddamn night.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.389
Zelda.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.745
Zelda!

18:38.485 --> 18:39.485
Zelda!

18:41.921 --> 18:43.190
Zelda!

18:47.594 --> 18:49.196
Zelda!

18:50.563 --> 18:51.798
Zelda!

19:01.941 --> 19:03.376
Zelda!

19:17.224 --> 19:19.226
I'm sorry about
your parents leaving.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.632
I think I'm gonna
write them a letter.

19:25.698 --> 19:29.001
Let them know exactly
how I feel about all this.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.833
I'd play you a tune but...

20:33.900 --> 20:35.535
my ukulele's gone bust.

20:35.602 --> 20:38.905
Hm. I don't think
a tune would do it.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.418
Thank you, Townsend.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.091
Guess I should
get back in there.

20:59.158 --> 21:00.327
Yes.

22:31.951 --> 22:32.985
Zelda.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.253
Zelda!

22:34.320 --> 22:36.423
- What are you doing?
- Just what it looks like.

22:36.489 --> 22:37.757
I'm leavin'.

22:37.824 --> 22:40.126
Please, please stay.
I need you to stay.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.161
How can you even say that to me?

22:42.228 --> 22:43.663
I'm done.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.465
What are you even talking about?

22:45.532 --> 22:47.433
I can't do this anymore.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.268
Not Westport, not New York,

22:49.335 --> 22:51.704
none of it.

22:51.771 --> 22:55.908
I feel like I'm
losing everything.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.977
I need to go home.

23:03.115 --> 23:05.718
I know you do, Zelda.

23:07.186 --> 23:08.655
I know you do.
