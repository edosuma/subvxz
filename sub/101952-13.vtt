eye roll GIF I sent

10:28.827 --> 10:30.008
wasn't clear enough for you?

10:30.108 --> 10:33.011
- I've been doing
a lot of think, Mo.

10:33.111 --> 10:35.493
About how I see myself
in the world,

10:35.593 --> 10:37.054
and the kinds of messages
I wanna send out there

10:37.154 --> 10:39.656
for my children.

10:39.756 --> 10:41.978
And I don't want my baggage
to get in the way of us--

10:42.078 --> 10:43.820
- I'm sorry, I'm not about to
do this with you.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.221
The guests of honors
are on their way, so.

10:45.321 --> 10:47.343
- Fine.

10:47.443 --> 10:49.605
But I'm not leaving
until you talk to me.

10:50.766 --> 10:52.387
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:52.487 --> 10:53.588
I just wanted to let you know,

10:53.688 --> 10:55.190
I actually haven't told anyone

10:55.290 --> 10:57.352
about you and I
except for Mo.

10:57.452 --> 10:58.953
Oh, and my mom.
- Wow, all right.

10:59.053 --> 11:00.314
Well, maybe it's best
we keep it that way

11:00.414 --> 11:01.955
just for tonight for them.

11:02.055 --> 11:03.437
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I agree.
- Yeah.

11:03.537 --> 11:04.798
- Let's not makes
tonight about us

11:04.898 --> 11:06.119
for Max and Rose's sake.

11:06.219 --> 11:07.440
Oh, there they are.

11:07.540 --> 11:09.482
Wow, you guys look great.

11:09.582 --> 11:10.643
- Thanks.

11:10.743 --> 11:12.484
- Simon and I broke up.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.446
- What?

11:14.546 --> 11:17.369
- Yeah. We sure did.

11:17.469 --> 11:20.031
It's the perfect time
for me to grab a drink.

11:21.392 --> 11:22.773
- Are you okay?

11:22.873 --> 11:25.055
- Uh, yeah, sorry, that...

11:25.155 --> 11:26.537
it just slipped out,
but you guys

11:26.637 --> 11:27.597
probably would have
found out anyway.

11:27.677 --> 11:29.779
- I'm sure we would have.

11:29.879 --> 11:31.140

11:32.441 --> 11:34.443
It's cute.

11:38.086 --> 11:39.548
- Stay positive, Zoey.

11:39.648 --> 11:40.949
It's okay.
That is great too.

11:41.049 --> 11:42.550
Thank you so much.

11:42.650 --> 11:44.392
Mo, is it just me

11:44.492 --> 11:46.714
or there is some weird vibes
to this party.

11:46.814 --> 11:49.256
Maybe there's something
in the tequila.

11:50.737 --> 11:51.918
- Mm-mmm.
That's wonderful.

11:52.018 --> 11:53.359
- Good.
Yeah, that's good.

11:53.459 --> 11:55.681
- Danny!
So good to see you.

11:55.781 --> 11:57.803
I can't believe this is the
first time you've been here.

11:57.903 --> 12:00.085

really zhuzh.

12:02.627 --> 12:03.969
So, when are you guys opening?

12:04.069 --> 12:05.250
- Literally months ago.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.171
- Sorry, I'm just distracted--

12:07.271 --> 12:08.813
both: Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

12:08.913 --> 12:11.015
I'm distracted because
word got out

12:11.115 --> 12:13.457
about the late-night ayahuasca
hikes I've been taking,

12:13.557 --> 12:14.858
and the media's having
a field day.

12:14.958 --> 12:16.699

on day one,

19:08.511 --> 19:10.493
you, uh,

19:10.593 --> 19:12.975
you were always such
a good friend to me.

19:13.075 --> 19:15.177

the job over Max.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.734

there's still
