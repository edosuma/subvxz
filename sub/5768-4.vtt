WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:05.562
*

00:24.150 --> 00:26.584
PETER:
The doctor said the stroke
did no permanent damage,

00:26.620 --> 00:27.587
so if you just keep taking...

00:27.620 --> 00:29.326
So, where am I going?

00:29.360 --> 00:32.158
The luncheon, remember?

00:32.200 --> 00:33.622
Yes, where am
I going afterwards?

00:33.660 --> 00:36.595
Oh, home-- I set up
a room for you upstairs.

00:36.630 --> 00:37.597
Your house?

00:37.630 --> 00:39.393
Yeah.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.431
Won't Alicia have
a problem With that?

00:41.470 --> 00:42.698
I don't think so.

00:42.740 --> 00:45.061
Mr. Gold.
Oh.

00:45.110 --> 00:46.134
Eli?

00:46.180 --> 00:47.272
Hold on.

00:47.310 --> 00:48.436
One second, Mom.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.641
How's she doing?

00:50.680 --> 00:52.443
ELI:
Well, she's getting him to
commit to a timeline.

00:52.480 --> 00:53.640
Good, uh, anything more

00:53.680 --> 00:56.183
on that campaign worker--
what's her name?

00:56.220 --> 00:57.118
Indira Starr.

00:57.150 --> 00:58.686
I have the investigator
on the other line,

00:58.720 --> 01:00.119
double-checking the dates.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.752
Oh, good.
Who's the investigator?

01:01.790 --> 01:03.587
Kalinda.

01:03.630 --> 01:05.325
Should I not?

01:05.360 --> 01:06.554
Uh, no, no, no, it's fine.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.249
So, how are we doing
on the straw poll?

01:08.300 --> 01:09.699
Uh, you'll win it.
It's just a question

01:09.730 --> 01:11.823
of whether the press think
you've won it by enough.

01:11.870 --> 01:13.360
Okay, well, keep me in the loop.

01:14.470 --> 01:16.768
Well, let's get you
to that luncheon.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.698
Peter, what's going on?

01:18.740 --> 01:20.605
Nothing's the matter, Mom.

01:20.640 --> 01:21.732
It's obviously something.

01:21.780 --> 01:23.338
It's just a story

01:23.380 --> 01:26.213
we want to keep from
being written, that's all.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.218
Somebody... is lying about me.

01:28.250 --> 01:31.219
About you and
some campaign worker?

01:31.250 --> 01:32.888
Yeah.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.888
And Alicia's hurting you?

01:34.920 --> 01:36.319
No-- what are you
talking about? No.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.578
I don't believe you.

01:38.630 --> 01:41.394
Mother, Alicia has been great.

01:41.430 --> 01:43.159
She's with the press right now,

01:43.200 --> 01:45.168
trying to keep the story
from being printed.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.162
And this happened when?

01:49.510 --> 01:51.307
You seem to answer

01:51.340 --> 01:53.205
questions with questions,
Mrs. Florrick.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.537
Yes, only to help clarify.

01:54.580 --> 01:56.707
RICHARD:
To the best of her
recollection, she said

01:56.750 --> 01:59.913
it happened
on August 21, 2012.

01:59.950 --> 02:02.748
Indira Starr says she was
in my apartment August 21, 2012?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.143
MANDY:
Yes.

02:04.190 --> 02:05.509
Sleeping with your husband.

02:08.760 --> 02:10.625
And she said that I found her
hiding in my bathroom

02:10.660 --> 02:12.753
and that I told her Peter
and I had an open marriage?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.119
RICHARD:
Yes.

02:15.400 --> 02:19.439
Well, Peter and I
were separated then,

02:19.470 --> 02:21.358
so that's impossible.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.469
Another lie.

02:22.510 --> 02:25.707
At a certain point,
the story just crumbles, Mandy.

02:25.740 --> 02:27.833
Indira Starr says she slept
with Peter on September 30

02:27.880 --> 02:29.677
at the St. Martin Hotel
and afterward,

02:29.710 --> 02:32.372
she heard him call you to
discuss picking up the kids.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.569
Is that not true?

02:33.620 --> 02:35.474
What time was that exactly?

02:35.520 --> 02:37.647
So Eli can double
check her story?
No.

02:37.690 --> 02:40.659
So, I can refresh my memory.

02:40.690 --> 02:42.385
You really are a lavwer.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.284
Yes, and I am late for court.

02:44.330 --> 02:48.528
She said she heard
the call at 11:30 pm.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.699
Approximately.
ALICIA:
No. To the best

02:50.730 --> 02:52.334
of my memory, Peter and I
didn't talk that night.

02:52.370 --> 02:57.398
Well, thank you for
your time, Mrs. Florrick.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.407
It's much appreciated.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.407
You're welcome.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.431
Hope you kill the story.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.742
I don't like being lied about.

03:02.780 --> 03:03.769
No one does.

03:05.510 --> 03:06.613
I could kiss you.

03:06.650 --> 03:09.915
Well, that would give them
something to write about.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.281
Hey, you got a pen?

03:11.320 --> 03:14.255
Yeah, Eli, I have a pen.

03:14.290 --> 03:17.453
She claims Peter made a call at
11:30, immediately after sex.

03:17.490 --> 03:18.650
At the St. Martin Hotel?

03:18.690 --> 03:20.453
Mm-hmm. 15th floor.

03:20.500 --> 03:24.789
Indira Starr was in room 803
and then she went up to Peter's.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.434
You might check.

03:26.470 --> 03:29.598
I think I was in the
adjoining room that night.

03:29.640 --> 03:33.474
The 15th... with the door open.

03:33.510 --> 03:36.377
This is Tre Lawson.

03:36.410 --> 03:41.018
Tre was a 19-year-old college
freshman, living his dream:

03:41.050 --> 03:45.316
attending Chicago Polytech
on a water polo scholarship.

03:45.350 --> 03:49.013
Until one day,
he was hazed to death by...

03:49.060 --> 03:50.584
MAN:
This man.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.359
His teammate, Wayne Crockett.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.498
He is the one who taunted Tre,

03:57.530 --> 04:01.034
bullied him
and eventually drowned him.

04:01.070 --> 04:04.437
Wayne Crockett plead
guilty to the drowning.

04:04.470 --> 04:07.268
He is serving
eight years in prison.

04:07.310 --> 04:10.746
And yet, Ms. Lockhart
isn't satisfied.

04:10.780 --> 04:12.418
She is suing...

04:12.450 --> 04:14.372
The university

04:14.420 --> 04:16.741
_ where this
heinous crIme took place--

04:16.790 --> 04:18.280
Chicago Polytech.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.311
They are the ones
who let the bullying

04:20.360 --> 04:23.056
at this yearly water polo party
get out of hand.

04:23.090 --> 04:25.923
And as much as my learned
colleague Mr. Andrews

04:25.960 --> 04:28.599
would like to make this
case about Mr. Crockett,

04:28.630 --> 04:29.995
it is actually about

04:30.030 --> 04:32.533
the university...

04:32.570 --> 04:35.664
turning a blind eye
to a vicious student ritual

04:35.700 --> 04:40.535
that cost Mr. and Mrs. Lawson
their son.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.377
(all cheering and yelling)

04:48.050 --> 04:49.347
DIANE:
And what is this,

04:49.390 --> 04:50.516
Coach Shank?

04:50.550 --> 04:52.552
The Dunk.
And "The Dunk"

04:52.590 --> 04:54.558
is a yearly party
the water polo team has

04:54.590 --> 04:56.478
the night before
its first match?

04:56.530 --> 05:00.091
Yeah, um, but it's not
approved by the school or me.

05:00.130 --> 05:01.529
But, you've been to one before?

05:01.560 --> 05:03.494
Uh, yeah, a few years
ago, but when I saw

05:03.530 --> 05:05.020
what was happening, I left.

05:05.070 --> 05:07.436
So, could you describe
what is happening here?

05:09.540 --> 05:11.405
It's the first year
players, they're...

05:11.440 --> 05:12.839
being held under by
the veteran players.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.801
I see.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.946
For as long as they
can hold their breath?

05:16.980 --> 05:19.847
Yeah, but again,

05:19.880 --> 05:20.949
the school doesn't approve.

05:20.980 --> 05:21.947
(screaming on video)

05:21.980 --> 05:24.414
He's drowning!

05:24.450 --> 05:27.556
Get him out, get him
out of the pool!

05:27.590 --> 05:29.581
(clamoring, screaming)

05:35.430 --> 05:36.863
(turns off video)

05:36.900 --> 05:39.596
In fact, didn't
you tell the team

05:39.640 --> 05:40.937
not to do the Dunk
this year?

05:40.970 --> 05:42.528
Yes, I did; I thought
it was wrong.
But the team

05:42.570 --> 05:46.404
did it anyway and they
took it off campus.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.931
Yeah, at one of the houses
of one of the team members.

05:48.980 --> 05:50.470
So, how could anyone
possibly conclude

05:50.510 --> 05:53.673
this was sanctioned
by the unIverSIty?

05:53.720 --> 05:54.778
YOUNG MAN:
They knew about it.

05:54.820 --> 05:57.482
It's been an institution
at this school for 50 years.

05:57.520 --> 06:00.512
And did the university have a
"wink-wink" attitude towards...

06:00.560 --> 06:01.879
Objection, Your Honor.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.023
I will sustain that.

06:03.060 --> 06:06.052
ALICIA:
Now, Coach Shanks stated
that he told the team

06:06.090 --> 06:07.899
not to have the dunk
this year, is that true?

06:07.930 --> 06:09.124
Yeah, but they say
that every year.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.422
And you received a text

06:10.470 --> 06:11.960
from Coach Shank
the night of the Dunk?

06:12.000 --> 06:12.830
Yes, I did.

06:12.870 --> 06:14.531
Could you read the text?

06:14.570 --> 06:17.437
"Don't get too drunk
at the Dunk.

06:17.470 --> 06:18.539
Have match tomorrow."

06:21.940 --> 06:23.578
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, Mr. Sultan.

06:31.650 --> 06:33.515
He offered 500,000.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.586
I told him we're not
budging from six million, right?

06:36.630 --> 06:38.757
Yes, this has been hard,
hearing him say we're greedy.

06:38.790 --> 06:39.950
The more they call you names,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.149
the more you
know you're winning.

06:41.200 --> 06:41.996
(phone buzzing)

06:42.030 --> 06:43.861
Oh, would you
excuse me a second?

06:43.900 --> 06:45.527
You almost done?

06:45.570 --> 06:47.936
Yup, in another ten minutes,

06:47.970 --> 06:50.507
we'll no longer occupy
the 27th floor.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.609
How'd it look?

06:51.640 --> 06:52.538
Sad.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.729
We'll get it back, Will.

06:53.780 --> 06:54.735
I know.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.202
You retreat to advance.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.468
It just feels like we've been

06:57.510 --> 06:58.772
retreating for four years now.

06:58.810 --> 07:00.539
We're still standing.

07:00.580 --> 07:02.616
Every other firm that started
out when we did, they're gone.

07:02.650 --> 07:03.480
I know.

07:03.520 --> 07:04.817
But, if you ever
want to be motivated,

07:04.850 --> 07:06.181
just come on down to the 27th.

07:06.220 --> 07:09.109
It's a kick in the ass.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.981
Thank you so much for having me.

07:12.030 --> 07:14.919
I imagine you'll
forgive a mother

07:14.960 --> 07:16.825
for singing the praises
of her son.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.565
He's handsome.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.567
(audience laughs)

07:19.600 --> 07:22.160
Now, I know that might
not be the best reason

07:22.200 --> 07:23.406
to vote for a governor,

07:23.440 --> 07:28.230
but there will always be some
women who will come forward

07:28.280 --> 07:32.546
saying my son flirted with them
or-or-or touched them...

07:32.580 --> 07:33.672
(snorts, coughs)

07:33.720 --> 07:36.484
...but I want you to know
Peter has always struggled

07:36.520 --> 07:38.841
with women coming after him.

07:38.890 --> 07:40.858
Even in grade school.
MOODY:
Hey, Eli.

07:40.890 --> 07:43.859
You know, just checking in.

07:43.890 --> 07:47.792
Having a good time here at the
Alliance for Retired Americans.

07:47.830 --> 07:50.697
With, uh, your girl
Jackie and would you

07:50.730 --> 07:51.924
like to know what she just said?

07:51.970 --> 07:53.665
JACKIE:
Well, I told Peter you just have

07:53.700 --> 07:55.497
to beat them off with a stick.

07:55.540 --> 07:56.529
Stop her!

07:56.570 --> 07:58.265
How would you suggest I do that?

07:58.310 --> 07:59.572
Use a 2x4 if you have to.

07:59.610 --> 08:01.828
And Peter is
an absolute gentleman,

08:01.880 --> 08:04.747
women think
he's being nice and, uh,

08:04.780 --> 08:06.771
try to take
advantage of him-- yes?

08:06.820 --> 08:08.674
Eli would like to talk to you.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.712
I'm supposed to tackle
you if you say no.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.218
JACKIE:
Hello, Eli.

08:14.260 --> 08:17.980
Jackie, I need you to excuse
yourself from the speech

08:18.030 --> 08:19.588
and let Mr. Moody
drive you over here.

08:19.630 --> 08:20.722
I'm in the middle of my remarks.

08:20.760 --> 08:21.829
Jackie!

08:21.860 --> 08:23.725
You're gonna apologize
to the room

08:23.770 --> 08:25.658
and tell them that
your stroke has left you

08:25.700 --> 08:26.837
weak and then
you're gonna get...

08:29.640 --> 08:31.528
(anxious chuckle)

08:31.570 --> 08:33.606
(laughs)

08:35.310 --> 08:37.039
Just a few more questions,
Mr. Sultan.

08:37.080 --> 08:41.016
You were the best friend of
the killer, Wayne Crockett?

08:41.050 --> 08:42.210
Well, I don't know about "best."

08:42.250 --> 08:43.615
But you were friends?

08:43.650 --> 08:45.845
He texted you?
Yes.

08:45.890 --> 08:49.656
And could you read this
text he wrote you there?

08:49.690 --> 08:51.328
It's right there, that one.

08:51.360 --> 08:52.224
"Is Mary bringing the brews?"

08:52.260 --> 08:54.728
This was referring to
the party, the Dunk?

08:54.760 --> 08:56.591
Yeah.

08:56.630 --> 08:58.120
And who's Mary?

09:01.200 --> 09:02.599
HORACE:
Mary?

09:02.640 --> 09:03.709
It's no one.

09:03.740 --> 09:05.628
(laughs)

09:05.670 --> 09:08.798
Mary is no one.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.649
Uh, well, uh, here's
an easier question:

09:10.680 --> 09:12.739
Who brought the brews
that night?

09:14.150 --> 09:15.242
Tre.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.316
Ah, Tre Lawson, the victim.

09:17.350 --> 09:22.185
So, was Mr. Crockett
referring to Tre as a "Mary"?

09:22.220 --> 09:24.688
Your Honor, objection.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.857
I'm not quite sure what
Mr. Andrews finds relevant here.

09:26.900 --> 09:27.855
Yes, I'm intrigued,

09:27.900 --> 09:30.767
Mr. Andrews, but confused.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.189
"Mary" is a derogatory term for
someone who's gay, Your Honor.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.093
Objection!
Objection!

09:35.740 --> 09:37.867
(all three arguing
over each other)

09:37.910 --> 09:40.936
Okay, okay,
okay, thank you.

09:40.980 --> 09:43.278
Mr. Andrews?
We would agree the

09:43.310 --> 09:45.369
plaintiff has proved
the university was aware

09:45.410 --> 09:47.617
of the Dunk, but
it is my contention

09:47.650 --> 09:49.072
that the university could
not have controlled

09:49.120 --> 09:50.485
the killer because this
was a hate crime.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.659
Your Honor, it has no bearing...
No, that is completely
irrelevant...

09:52.690 --> 09:53.850
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

09:53.890 --> 09:55.983
Mr. Andrews, are you saying
the university isn't liable

09:56.020 --> 09:58.659
if Mr. Crockett killed Tre
because he was gay?

09:58.690 --> 09:59.918
ANDREWS:
Yes.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.359
If the murder was not

10:01.400 --> 10:03.095
an inevitable consequence
of the Dunk...

10:03.130 --> 10:05.291
If-if it was not inevitable,
then the university

10:05.330 --> 10:07.264
could not have
foreseen the murder.

10:07.300 --> 10:09.029
The killer was never charged
with a hate crime.

10:09.070 --> 10:10.105
Yes, but that

10:10.140 --> 10:12.233
should not impede
Mr. Andrews' theory of the case.

10:12.270 --> 10:15.171
You say the university
is liable

10:15.210 --> 10:17.770
because it knew about the
hazing and didn't stop it.

10:17.810 --> 10:20.142
He's saying the murder
went beyond the hazing

10:20.180 --> 10:21.670
because it was a hate crime,

10:21.720 --> 10:25.838
And, therefore, the university
isn't liable.

10:25.890 --> 10:28.779
Well, I'll let both theories
contend and let the jury decide.

10:28.820 --> 10:30.788
So, come back tomorrow,

10:30.830 --> 10:32.991
ready to argue whether
this is a hate crime or not.

10:56.850 --> 10:58.841
(elevator bell dings)

11:10.430 --> 11:11.863
(elevator bell dings)

11:11.900 --> 11:14.892
(people talking indistinctly,
phones ringing)

11:24.310 --> 11:26.244
Our son isn't gay.
Good.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.042
Anything you can do
to help us.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.411
It's a lie
and he's gonna keep on

11:28.450 --> 11:29.348
lying as long as we hold out.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.814
No, sir, he is lying
to make you settle.

11:31.850 --> 11:33.283
You told us this was
gorng to be an easy...

11:33.320 --> 11:34.548
What I told you, sir,
is that the defense will try

11:34.590 --> 11:37.753
anything in its power to shake
your confidence in this case.

11:37.790 --> 11:39.155
Can you promise me

11:39.190 --> 11:40.896
you can win this still?

11:40.930 --> 11:42.420
No.

11:42.460 --> 11:44.997
I can promise you that we
will work even harder now

11:45.030 --> 11:46.895
because I am angry...

11:46.940 --> 11:48.760
and this should make you
angry, too.

11:52.810 --> 11:53.902
Okay.

11:53.940 --> 11:55.771
Okay, if he's not gay,
let's prove it.

11:55.810 --> 11:56.879
Get Kalinda on it.

11:56.910 --> 11:58.468
I'll review the _case law
on hate crimes,

11:58.510 --> 11:59.670
then we'll talk again
in two hours.

11:59.710 --> 12:02.019
WILL: It's not about comfort;
we're the named partners.

12:02.050 --> 12:03.984
Yes, and I'm the
creditors' trustee.

12:04.020 --> 12:04.816
I can veto your decisions.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.386
WILL: Not on this.
Not on office space.

12:06.420 --> 12:07.910
CLARKE: I'm not saying
I can on office space.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.188
I am saying
I have more clout

12:09.220 --> 12:10.824
and I'm willing to take
a smaller office.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.384
Which is your choice.

12:12.430 --> 12:14.352
And what is the topic
under discussion?

12:14.400 --> 12:15.890
He wants to put a wall in here;
right there.

12:15.930 --> 12:17.158
And you and I will
share the space.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.122
CLARKE: We lost
the 27th floor.

12:19.170 --> 12:20.068
We have to double up,

12:22.470 --> 12:24.108
That will undercut morale,

12:24.140 --> 12:26.973
so it's incumbent upon
leadership to sacrifice.

12:27.010 --> 12:28.830
True.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.871
But we're not gonna do it.

12:30.910 --> 12:32.138
We're bringing
this firm back,

12:32.180 --> 12:34.068
and we're doing it in
the offices we have now.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.418
And unless you want to go to
the bankruptcy judge on this,

12:36.450 --> 12:38.941
Mr. Hayden,
I suggest you back off!

12:41.890 --> 12:44.882
At some point, you'll realize

12:44.930 --> 12:47.455
I'm trying to save you
from yourself.

12:51.530 --> 12:53.031
What got into you?

12:53.070 --> 12:54.560
Wheaties.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.160
Mr. Gold, I was only trying
to help you.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.165
Don't.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.973
I am trying to kill
anadmb

13:00.010 --> 13:01.932
about Peter sleeping
with a campaign worker,

13:01.980 --> 13:04.141
and every time you talk about
women chasing him,

13:04.180 --> 13:05.408
you make that the story.

13:05.450 --> 13:07.270
Don't bark at me, Mr. Gold.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.810
Oh, Jackie, that wasn't barking.

13:08.850 --> 13:09.817
This is barking!

13:09.850 --> 13:12.182
When you've calmed down,

13:12.220 --> 13:14.108
we can discuss my schedule.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.809
Your schedule's changed, Jackie.

13:15.860 --> 13:17.327
You're in Double-A ball now.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.021
I have no idea what that means.

13:19.060 --> 13:20.027
That means that,

13:20.060 --> 13:21.596
until you behave,

13:21.630 --> 13:24.190
you'll be speaking at
the Regional Senior Center

13:24.230 --> 13:25.561
of Greater Morton Grove.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.067
I've never heard of that.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.089
Exactly.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.960
Miss Hayward.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.102
MADDIE:
Mr. Gold.

13:31.140 --> 13:32.937
You seem busy.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.403
Yes, we're preparing for
a straw poll this weekend.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.976
It means everything and nothing.

13:37.010 --> 13:38.170
Why everything?

13:38.210 --> 13:41.316
Well, the straw poll votes

13:41.350 --> 13:43.011
don't actually count
for anything,

13:43.050 --> 13:45.245
but if we don't get them,
the press will say we're...

13:45.290 --> 13:47.053
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

13:47.090 --> 13:48.352
Aanay, what can I
do for you?

13:48.390 --> 13:51.029
Um...

13:51.060 --> 13:53.199
Hey! Out.

13:57.400 --> 14:02.064
I'm hearing rumors
that trouble me, as a donor.

14:02.100 --> 14:05.001
Well, if they trouble you,
they trouble me.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.200
What are they?

14:06.240 --> 14:07.434
That there's another shoe
about to drop.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.948
You understand, Eli,
I agreed to contribute--

14:09.980 --> 14:13.438
that was dependent on Peter
keeping his pants zipped.

14:15.450 --> 14:17.088
Where are you hearing this?

14:17.120 --> 14:19.042
The Women's Leadership Forum.

14:19.090 --> 14:21.012
I was encouraging
other donors to give,

14:21.060 --> 14:23.585
and there was some, uh...
(wry laugh)

14:23.630 --> 14:24.927
reluctance.

14:24.960 --> 14:28.259
Well, Peter has
done nothing untoward.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.392
(phone buzzing)

14:29.430 --> 14:31.625
But his political enemies
will still lie about him.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.160
I have to go.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.031
Have I assuaged your concerns?

14:35.070 --> 14:38.062
I'm not sure.

14:41.180 --> 14:43.171
Cary, thank you
for stepping in.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.075
Very good job
on the copyright suit.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.338
Uh, thank you, sir.

14:46.380 --> 14:48.974
No court time,
and they settled for $80,000.

14:49.020 --> 14:52.012
Well, if the firm can
avoid court, we win.

14:54.020 --> 14:57.956
I feel you've been without an
office for much too long, Cary.

14:57.990 --> 14:59.059
You've been here...

14:59.090 --> 15:00.193
Uh, two months.

15:00.230 --> 15:02.960
And everyone
speaks highly of you.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.991
So I'd like to move you
into an office

15:05.030 --> 15:08.090
by the end of the day.

15:08.140 --> 15:09.038
(wry laugh)

15:09.070 --> 15:10.059
Thank you.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.066
And I want you to come to me
when you need to.

15:12.110 --> 15:14.078
When I...?

15:14.110 --> 15:15.577
If there's anything
you think can be...

15:15.610 --> 15:20.411
improved... please feel free
to contact me.

15:20.450 --> 15:24.409
You mean... like... anything?

15:24.450 --> 15:26.111
Like, the lunchroom or...

15:26.150 --> 15:26.980
Well...

15:27.020 --> 15:30.979
people, cases,
management decisions...

15:31.030 --> 15:32.054
anything.

15:32.090 --> 15:34.092
I'd hate to limit
your scope.

15:36.430 --> 15:39.558
Beth Alexander, and I...

15:39.600 --> 15:41.067
What was the second question?

15:41.100 --> 15:42.135
Your address.

15:42.170 --> 15:43.137
Oh. Sorry.

15:43.170 --> 15:44.137
(anxious laugh)

15:44.170 --> 15:45.137
I'm nervous.

15:45.170 --> 15:46.307
On campus. Van de Beek dorms.

15:46.340 --> 15:47.409
Thank you, Beth.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.147
And you were a classmate
and friend of the victim Tre?

15:50.180 --> 15:51.101
Yeah.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.072
In fact, you were
more than that, weren't you?

15:53.120 --> 15:53.870
What do you mean?

15:53.920 --> 15:55.979
You dated.
Objection, Your Honor.

15:56.020 --> 15:58.079
Relevance-- one can be gay
and still date women.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.054
Then let the defense make that
argument In closmg, Your Honor.

16:00.090 --> 16:01.182
This is not the time...
Excuse me...

16:01.220 --> 16:03.085
(both talking at once)

16:03.130 --> 16:05.758
Hold on, now, both of you!

16:05.790 --> 16:07.052
Sit down, Ms. Lockhart.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.226
Mr. Andrews is correct.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.194
You are not
the questioning attorney.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.666
Mrs. Florrick, do you have
the same argument

16:13.700 --> 16:15.395
against Mr. Andrews'
objection?
Yes, Your Honor.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.305
Then, Mr. Andrews,
I overrule your objection.

16:17.340 --> 16:20.309
Let's not argue our case
through objections.

16:20.340 --> 16:22.035
Please.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.241
Made me break my paperweight.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.577
Mrs. Florrick, you may continue.

16:27.580 --> 16:30.242
Thank you.

16:30.290 --> 16:34.181
Now, Beth, um,
I hate to be blunt...

16:34.220 --> 16:36.108
but did you have sex with Tre?

16:36.160 --> 16:37.388
Yeah.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.580
On many occasions?

16:39.630 --> 16:41.154
Yeah, on many.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.259
And to your knowledge,
did he ever sleep with men?

16:43.300 --> 16:45.598
No! Tre was from
a religious family.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.360
He never...

16:48.400 --> 16:50.106
Sorry, Mr. and
Mrs. Lawson.

16:50.140 --> 16:52.358
He never slept with men.

16:52.410 --> 16:53.206
Good.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.208
Thank you, Beth.
No further questions.

16:55.240 --> 16:58.778
Did you hear the rumor on campus
that Tre was gay?

16:58.810 --> 17:00.175
Objection, Your Honor.
Hearsay.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.346
Ms. Lockhart, again?

17:01.380 --> 17:03.587
Objection, Your Honor.
Hearsay.

17:03.620 --> 17:04.689
No, Ms. Florrick.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.789
And by extension, Ms. Lockhart.

17:08.260 --> 17:10.228
The question is whether
she heard the rumor. That's all.

17:10.260 --> 17:11.022
She can answer yes or no.

17:11.060 --> 17:13.290
Did I hear the rumor
he was gay?

17:13.330 --> 17:14.297
Mm-hmm.

17:14.330 --> 17:15.149
Yeah.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.451
Because he had a lisp?

17:16.500 --> 17:17.524
Well, I don't know why.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.219
It was probably
just the way he was.

17:19.270 --> 17:20.669
You mean... effeminate?

17:23.440 --> 17:24.839
ANDREWS: _
So, anyone not knowmg

17:24.870 --> 17:26.701
you were dating Tre
might think he was gay.

17:26.740 --> 17:27.968
Objection!

17:28.010 --> 17:30.171
That is irrelevant...
That is exactly my
point, Your Honor.

17:30.210 --> 17:31.177
Defense is just pushing...

17:31.210 --> 17:32.677
But that's my point,
Your Honor.

17:32.710 --> 17:34.678
Hate crime is not about
whether the victim

17:34.720 --> 17:37.439
was gay or not, it is whether
the killer thought he was gay.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.640
Your Honor, this lawsuit
has gone far afield.

17:39.690 --> 17:41.157
Yes, Ms. Lockhart.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.714
But the point is well-taken.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.227
The reality of the victim's

17:44.260 --> 17:46.626
sexual orientation
is immaterial.

17:46.660 --> 17:48.298
I might seem gay to someone.

17:48.330 --> 17:50.195
Until they found out
I had a wife.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.288
So, unless you have evidence

17:54.340 --> 17:57.104
as to the mental state
of the killer, I will allow.

18:01.310 --> 18:02.538
(elevator bell dings)

18:02.580 --> 18:05.469
You get to Kalinda; ask her to
talk to the killer in prison.

18:05.510 --> 18:06.738
He has reason
to help us.

18:06.780 --> 18:09.749
Got it.

18:09.780 --> 18:11.714
I need your help.

18:11.750 --> 18:14.150
Oh, and why should today
be any different?

18:14.190 --> 18:16.181
This is the new Eli.
The thankful Eli.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.653
So thank you.

18:17.690 --> 18:19.282
Now I need
something else.

18:19.330 --> 18:20.297
CLARKE:
Mrs. Florrick.

18:20.330 --> 18:21.354
A quick matter?

18:22.730 --> 18:24.266
I know you're having
drinks with Maddie tonight.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.188
You do?
I make it my
business to know.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.367
(sighs heavily)

18:27.400 --> 18:28.196
That is a scary thought.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.798
She's heard the rumors
about Peter

18:29.840 --> 18:32.308
and she needs to know
it's a lie.
So tell her.

18:32.340 --> 18:34.604
No, she needs to hear
it from his wife.

18:34.640 --> 18:35.709
She knows I lie
for a living.

18:35.740 --> 18:36.832
If you tell her,
she'll believe you.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.302
This is a friendly drink, Eli.

18:38.350 --> 18:40.318
I'm not going to turn this
into a political thing.

18:40.350 --> 18:41.248
Then don't.
Tell her as a friend.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.838
(knocking)

18:42.880 --> 18:44.347
Okay, here's what
I'm gonna do:

18:44.390 --> 18:47.450
If she brings it up,
I will confirm that it is a lie,

18:47.490 --> 18:50.152
but I'm not going to
bring it up out of the blue.

18:50.190 --> 18:51.384
Alicia, please.

18:51.430 --> 18:52.556
She will not bring it up.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.592
Take what you can get, Eli.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.191
What do you think
of Cary Agos?

18:58.230 --> 18:59.788
What do I think?
I think he's great.

18:59.830 --> 19:01.559
You like him?

19:01.600 --> 19:02.498
Yes. Very much.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.735
I'm the one who suggested
the firm hire him.

19:04.770 --> 19:06.362
Good. That's all.

19:06.410 --> 19:10.608
Is there anyone else you'd like
to talk about, Mr. Hayden?

19:10.650 --> 19:12.277
No, just Cary.

19:13.650 --> 19:15.470
Here we go, Cary.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.579
Your new office.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.918
My office-- this is
Alicia's office.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.258
It wa Alicia's office.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.326
Now it's both of yours.

19:23.360 --> 19:26.249
Hello, Alicia.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.349
Hello.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.321
Hi, Cary.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.463
Alicia.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.967
CLARKE: So, this should
work out fine.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.663
Thank you for understanding.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.361
Welcome.

19:38.410 --> 19:39.365
I-I didn't ask for this.

19:39.410 --> 19:40.229
I know.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.840
(phone ringing)
Really. Welcome, Eli.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.199
Cary.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.672
I'm... losing my mind.

19:45.710 --> 19:46.938
It probably isn't for me.

19:46.980 --> 19:48.618
Alicia Florrick.

19:48.650 --> 19:49.844
(phone ringing)
Oh, yes, Kalinda.

19:51.120 --> 19:54.283
Wayne Crockett, find out whether
he knew the victim was gay.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.618
He's at Tamms.
Cary Agos.

19:56.660 --> 19:58.582
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, good.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.450
When can you meet?
We're not going
at him too late.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.455
No, we'll make him see
he's bitten off

20:01.500 --> 20:02.524
more than he can chew.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.266
He doesn't want
a hate crime charge

20:04.300 --> 20:05.369
any more than we do.
Look, I'm gonna try...

20:05.400 --> 20:06.697
What?

20:06.730 --> 20:09.631
I was just saying
I had to get a key.

20:09.670 --> 20:11.331
Oh. Thanks.

20:11.370 --> 20:12.962
ALICIA: Where are you, Kalinda?
What case?

20:13.010 --> 20:14.307
Nothing, it's just
something old.

20:15.640 --> 20:16.868
I'll speak to you later.
Bye.

20:16.910 --> 20:18.309
Would you like
to see the room?

20:18.350 --> 20:19.146
Yes, please.

20:19.180 --> 20:22.343
Look, were you here
on September 30?

20:22.380 --> 20:23.347
I was.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.483
It looks like
I checked them in.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.283
Oh, good. Great.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.311
Oh, this woman--
do you recognize her?

20:29.360 --> 20:30.759
No. Who is it?

20:30.790 --> 20:31.825
Indira Starr.

20:31.860 --> 20:34.829
She said she spent the night
in the 15th floor suite.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.498
Are you sure you don't
recognize her?

20:36.530 --> 20:39.499
I am sure, but...

20:39.530 --> 20:40.997
I don't check in everyone.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.406
Shall we?

20:43.440 --> 20:45.499
Mr. Gold was staying in the room
next to Mr. Florrick,

20:45.540 --> 20:46.939
but the door between
them was open,

20:46.970 --> 20:48.835
and I just wanted to see
if he had

20:48.880 --> 20:51.474
an unobstructed
view of the bedroom.

20:51.510 --> 20:53.512
Uh, actually...

20:53.550 --> 20:55.768
the connecting door
wasn't open.

20:55.820 --> 20:58.038
It wasn't?

20:58.090 --> 20:59.387
Uh-uh.

20:59.420 --> 21:00.785
What do you mean?

21:00.820 --> 21:03.527
I mean our staff has to open
the door connecting the rooms,

21:03.560 --> 21:05.448
and there was no request.

21:05.490 --> 21:07.492
Can't the occupants
open it on their own?

21:07.530 --> 21:09.725
No, I'm sorry.

21:11.530 --> 21:12.667
I've disappointed you.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.032
No, um, it's just not
what I expected.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.367
(elevator bell dings)

21:16.400 --> 21:18.459
Still want
to see the room?

21:18.510 --> 21:20.501
Yeah, sure.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.901
What did you just do?

21:28.950 --> 21:32.511
Well, the 15th floor
is the concierge floor.

21:32.550 --> 21:35.383
The guests are given
a keycard to access it.

21:35.420 --> 21:38.958
And someone on a lower floor
isn't given such a card?

21:38.990 --> 21:40.548
Concierge card? No.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.692
They have to pay for it.

21:41.730 --> 21:42.924
Why?

21:42.960 --> 21:44.791
Well, the campaign worker,
Indira Starr,

21:44.830 --> 21:46.422
who was on the eighth floor,

21:46.470 --> 21:48.836
she said she went up
to the 15th floor.

21:48.870 --> 21:50.406
Is that possible?

21:50.440 --> 21:52.431
If she was given
a concierge key,

21:52.470 --> 21:54.472
yes.

21:57.610 --> 21:58.679
I seem to have pleased you now.

21:58.710 --> 22:01.611
You sure have, Ms. Ledger.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.578
Pedro Almodvar.
Pedro... Manovedar.

22:07.620 --> 22:10.111
(laughing)
Pedro Am... Am...

22:10.160 --> 22:11.525
You're drunk.

22:11.560 --> 22:12.754
No, I don't...

22:12.790 --> 22:14.621
I've never said
that name before.

22:14.660 --> 22:15.957
Did we order these?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.399
No.

22:17.430 --> 22:19.125
They just bring them.

22:19.170 --> 22:21.468
They give rich people
free things.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.728
They just give...
Yes.

22:22.770 --> 22:23.702
Uh-huh.
They do.

22:23.740 --> 22:26.903
Um, apartment rooms,
food, free computers...

22:26.940 --> 22:28.532
Apartment rooms?

22:28.580 --> 22:30.502
Oh, wait, no.
Hotel rooms, I meant.
(laughing)

22:30.550 --> 22:32.905
Free hotel rooms,
cars, even.

22:32.950 --> 22:34.144
It's really very wrong.

22:34.180 --> 22:35.818
Poor people have to
pay for everything,

22:35.850 --> 22:37.989
and I am given stuff
I could buy a hundred of.

22:38.020 --> 22:39.146
Oh, no, no, no, no.

22:39.190 --> 22:40.555
I won't make it home.

22:40.590 --> 22:41.579
Well, my driver
can take you.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.882
Why do you want
to be my friend?

22:46.930 --> 22:48.557
(laughing):
What?

22:48.600 --> 22:52.627
Why do you want this,
why are we here?

22:52.670 --> 22:54.433
Um...

22:54.470 --> 22:57.962
I don't know,
do you not want to be here?

22:58.010 --> 22:59.807
Ijust... I'm...

22:59.840 --> 23:01.535
I'm not very interesting.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.172
(laughs):
Oh, my God.

23:03.210 --> 23:05.007
(laughing)

23:05.050 --> 23:07.041
I'm...

23:10.120 --> 23:11.712
What?

23:11.750 --> 23:13.012
What?

23:13.050 --> 23:14.517
You were gonna say
something. What?
No, no.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.959
I, um... I don't know.

23:15.990 --> 23:17.457
I'm... I'm just an idiot.

23:17.490 --> 23:19.629
Oh, no, now you just
have to say it.

23:22.660 --> 23:26.426
Thank you for giving, um,
to Peter's campaign.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.062
You're welcome.

23:30.100 --> 23:31.465
Was that it?

23:33.510 --> 23:35.899
I was questioned
by a reporter

23:35.940 --> 23:38.943
about Peter having an affair
with a campaign worker.

23:38.980 --> 23:41.869
And _there were lots of
questions about me, too.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.741
Things like... how I supposedly

23:44.790 --> 23:48.112
approved of the affair.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.082
So Ijust...

23:50.120 --> 23:53.453
I wanted you to know
what I'm going through.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.128
I'm sorry.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.889
That must be hard.

23:58.930 --> 24:00.192
It is.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.788
Is there anything
I can do?

24:01.840 --> 24:03.068
No, no, no. No. No.

24:03.100 --> 24:06.001
I think, um, we've convinced the
magazine that the story's false.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.132
Good.

24:12.180 --> 24:15.069
Did Eli tell you
to say that?

24:15.120 --> 24:15.973
Did... what do you mean?

24:16.020 --> 24:19.239
Well, I expressed
my concerns to him.

24:19.290 --> 24:21.918
Did he ask you
to speak to me?

24:21.960 --> 24:24.520
Yes.

24:26.060 --> 24:28.153
But I wanted to tell you anyway.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.725
I-I did.

24:36.070 --> 24:38.231
Okay.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.547
(buzzer sounds)

24:48.580 --> 24:50.138
(door opens, closes)

24:52.290 --> 24:54.258
Guard says you're
with the Lawsons.

24:54.290 --> 24:56.952
They're the reason I'm in here.
Why am I gonna help them?

24:56.990 --> 25:00.187
So you don't spend another 20
years in prison on a hate crime.

25:01.230 --> 25:03.221
Maybe they haven't told you.

25:03.260 --> 25:04.568
I've already been convicted.

25:04.600 --> 25:05.965
They can't charge me again.
No.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.763
Maybe they haven't told you.

25:07.800 --> 25:10.291
Hate crime is a federal charge.

25:10.340 --> 25:11.807
They can charge you again.

25:14.310 --> 25:17.279
Look, the school is saying
that you killed Tre

25:17.310 --> 25:19.005
because he was gay.

25:19.050 --> 25:20.005
Is that true?

25:20.050 --> 25:21.017
No.

25:21.050 --> 25:22.813
Tre wasn't gay.
Good.

25:22.850 --> 25:25.580
And you'll swear
to that in court?

25:25.620 --> 25:27.759
No, I'm not getting
on a witness stand.

25:27.790 --> 25:29.087
Why not?

25:29.120 --> 25:30.587
My lawyers don't want me to.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.188
There's more that can
go wrong than right.

25:33.230 --> 25:36.324
Then help us.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.725
Who can we speak to?

25:40.600 --> 25:41.589
Chad Minson.

25:41.640 --> 25:42.834
I'm a friend of
Wayne Crockett's.

25:42.870 --> 25:44.007
DIANE:
And what happened on the night

25:44.040 --> 25:46.634
of August 26, 2011, Chad?

25:46.670 --> 25:49.230
Wayne and I were in my room,
playing Call of Duty.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.999
We left about 3:00 in the
morning to go to a diner.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.779
And did you have occasion to
see Tre Lawson at that time?

25:53.820 --> 25:54.912
Yes.

25:54.950 --> 25:56.872
He was coming out of
Beth Alexander's room.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.148
They were kissing.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.317
And both you and
Mr. Crockett saw this?

26:00.350 --> 26:01.453
Objection as to what
Mr. Crockett saw.

26:01.490 --> 26:04.220
Uh, Mr. Minson, how do you know
what Mr. Crockett saw?

26:04.260 --> 26:05.682
'Cause we laughed about it.

26:05.730 --> 26:09.097
Beth was hot,
and Tre had no game, so...

26:09.130 --> 26:11.064
we didn't know
how he pulled that.

26:11.100 --> 26:12.067
Overruled.

26:12.100 --> 26:13.829
DIANE:
Mr. Minson...

26:13.870 --> 26:16.236
what is your sexual preference?

26:16.270 --> 26:17.567
I'm gay.

26:18.870 --> 26:20.064
And does Mr. Crockett know that?

26:20.110 --> 26:21.930
Objection as to
what Mr. Crockett knows.

26:21.980 --> 26:23.641
I'll allow it.
CHAD:
Yes.

26:23.680 --> 26:24.999
When I came out
in tenth grade,

26:25.050 --> 26:27.143
he was one of
the first people I told.

26:27.180 --> 26:28.875
And does Mr. Crockett...
hate you?

26:28.920 --> 26:29.875
(laughing):
No.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.615
So does the accusation

26:31.650 --> 26:33.117
that Wayne killed Tre
because he was gay

26:33.150 --> 26:34.356
seem odd to you?

26:34.390 --> 26:35.357
Objection!
JUDGE:
Sustained.

26:35.390 --> 26:36.459
No further questions.

26:36.490 --> 26:39.379
I think that puts this
hate crime insanity to rest.

26:39.430 --> 26:40.897
No need to object.
I'll withdraw.

26:47.100 --> 26:51.104
JACKIE:
Thank you for inviting me
to the Regional Senior Center

26:51.140 --> 26:53.267
of Greater Morton Grove.

26:53.310 --> 26:56.074
Your work here is...

26:57.110 --> 26:58.668
...extraordinary.

26:58.710 --> 27:02.771
And I know that my son,
in his many years at...

27:10.730 --> 27:14.325
...in his years at

27:14.360 --> 27:15.918
the State's Attorney's Office

27:15.960 --> 27:18.326
has thought often of the

27:18.370 --> 27:22.659
good people of Greater Morton
Grove, especially...

27:28.280 --> 27:30.840
...especially...

27:33.780 --> 27:36.419
Uh, especially the seniors.

27:36.450 --> 27:39.442
And we're going to need
everybody's help this weekend

27:39.490 --> 27:41.811
to make this straw poll
a success.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.725
It's-it's not just the...

27:45.230 --> 27:50.190
* When I turn on the radio...

27:50.230 --> 27:52.369
It's not just...

27:52.400 --> 27:55.836
It's...

27:55.870 --> 27:58.361
it's not just the most
dedicated voters

27:58.410 --> 28:01.038
who-who matter at a...

28:01.080 --> 28:03.139
at a straw poll.

28:05.010 --> 28:06.204
What is she doing?

28:06.250 --> 28:07.205
It's... it's a...

28:07.250 --> 28:09.218
She did that throughout
the whole thing?
Yeah.

28:09.250 --> 28:10.046
Odd, huh?

28:10.080 --> 28:12.241
This is because
I cut her schedule.

28:12.290 --> 28:13.882
She's getting back at me.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.410
I need to talk to that stupid...

28:15.460 --> 28:17.485
That was a terrific crowd.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.488
Oh. There's Mom.

28:19.530 --> 28:21.191
What's she doing?
Is that the luncheon?

28:21.230 --> 28:22.925
No, that's something
from today.

28:22.960 --> 28:25.121
JACKIE:
I've lost my place.

28:25.170 --> 28:26.489
Yeah. How's she doing?

28:26.530 --> 28:27.758
The straw poll...

28:27.800 --> 28:30.030
Well, um...

28:30.070 --> 28:31.469
struggling.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.774
Well, she needs to
get her sea legs back.

28:33.810 --> 28:35.732
By the way, she said you
cut her speaking schedule.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.475
Why don't I head out?

28:39.450 --> 28:41.077
Did you?
Did you, uh...

28:41.120 --> 28:42.314
cut her schedule down?

28:42.350 --> 28:43.419
Yes.

28:43.450 --> 28:46.783
Jackie has...

28:46.820 --> 28:49.789
tanked a few speeches.

28:49.820 --> 28:51.082
Really?
I thought she seemed good.

28:52.130 --> 28:54.394
Peter, we discussed this
at the beginning.

28:54.430 --> 28:56.796
I am the strategist.

28:56.830 --> 28:59.025
I have to be given leeway
to decide strategy.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.219
Yes, and I'm the candidate.

29:00.270 --> 29:02.033
And my mother's had a stroke,

29:02.070 --> 29:03.469
and she wants to be involved.

29:03.500 --> 29:04.933
Involve her.

29:05.970 --> 29:08.131
I'll see what I can do.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.136
ANDREWS:
Mr. Minson.

29:10.180 --> 29:14.514
You testified that Mr. Crockett
had no problem with gay people.

29:14.550 --> 29:17.110
Do you know if he had any
gay friends besides you?

29:17.150 --> 29:18.913
I don't know.
I never met any.

29:18.950 --> 29:20.417
Could it be he didn't
really view you as

29:20.450 --> 29:23.010
a gay friend, he viewed you
as a childhood friend?

29:23.060 --> 29:24.789
I guess.

29:24.830 --> 29:27.856
You said that, uh, Tre had
"no game" when it came to women.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.128
What did you mean by that?

29:29.160 --> 29:32.288
CHAD:
He... he wasn't
exactly a man's man.

29:32.330 --> 29:33.319
_ ANDREWS: _
Meaning he was effeminate.

29:33.370 --> 29:35.361
You could say that.
Did Wayne Crockett say that?

29:35.400 --> 29:37.095
Objection. Hearsay.

29:37.140 --> 29:38.562
I'll rephrase.

29:38.610 --> 29:42.330
Did you ever see Wayne
mock Tre for being girlish?

29:43.380 --> 29:46.178
Yes, but Wayne was just
busting balls, you know?

29:46.210 --> 29:48.269
Did Wayne make fun of other
men for being girlish?

29:48.320 --> 29:49.844
Your Honor, objection.

29:49.880 --> 29:50.847
(talking over each other)

29:50.890 --> 29:51.879
JUDGE:
One at a time.

29:51.920 --> 29:52.989
This has become absurd.

29:53.020 --> 29:54.180
What happened to liability?

29:54.220 --> 29:55.209
ANDREWS:
Liability is dependent

29:55.260 --> 29:56.818
on whether it's
a hate crime or not.

29:56.860 --> 29:58.851
But you keep changing
the nature of the hate.

29:58.890 --> 30:00.926
First it_ was a hate crime
against a gay man,

30:00.960 --> 30:02.996
and now it's a hate crime
against men who are...

30:04.570 --> 30:06.595
I shouldn't put words
in your mouth, Mr. Andrews.

30:06.630 --> 30:07.995
How would you put it?

30:08.040 --> 30:09.894
Swishy.
Ah.

30:09.940 --> 30:11.532
So now it's a hate crime
against "SWIShy" people,

30:11.570 --> 30:12.969
who are not gay.

30:13.010 --> 30:14.978
I'm alluding to
effeminate mannerisms

30:15.010 --> 30:16.602
which the jury
is entitled to conclude

30:16.640 --> 30:18.574
are a proxy for homosexuality.

30:18.610 --> 30:20.271
Your Honor, a mannerism
is not a protected class.

30:20.310 --> 30:22.574
DIANE:
There are effeminate
heterosexuals,

30:22.620 --> 30:23.769
and effeminate homosexuals,

30:23.820 --> 30:26.914
which is why the essence of
gayness is an actual sexual act.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.350
ANDREWS:
So there's no such thing
as an abstinent gay man?

30:29.390 --> 30:31.358
Or a gay man
who marries a woman?

30:33.960 --> 30:36.121
If an effeminate man

30:36.160 --> 30:38.390
marries a woman
and doesn't sleep With men,

30:38.430 --> 30:39.499
then yes, that man
is not gay.

30:39.530 --> 30:41.532
ANDREWS:
And if someone kills
an abstinent gay man,

30:41.570 --> 30:44.300
you're saying that's
not a hate crime?

30:44.340 --> 30:45.864
We're saying that you
can't commit a hate crime

30:45.910 --> 30:47.138
against a mannerism.

30:47.170 --> 30:50.276
But you can if that mannerism is
a prom for a protected class.

30:50.310 --> 30:51.572
JUDGE:
Okay.

30:51.610 --> 30:53.009
Very provocative, Mr. Andrews.

30:53.050 --> 30:54.540
But as a matter of law,

30:54.580 --> 30:56.411
I don't know if that's true.

30:56.450 --> 30:58.611
As my wife would say,

30:58.650 --> 31:00.242
"The law can't address
everything."

31:00.290 --> 31:02.884
ANDREWS:
Yes, but when the law can't,

31:02.920 --> 31:04.387
the jury must.

31:04.430 --> 31:07.081
Yes. True.

31:07.130 --> 31:08.620
My wife would agree
with that, too.

31:08.660 --> 31:10.628
I'm willing to say

31:10.660 --> 31:12.628
it's a question of fact,
and the province of the jury.

31:12.670 --> 31:13.625
I'll allow.

31:13.670 --> 31:15.228
What?

31:15.270 --> 31:16.294
I said, I'll allow.

31:16.340 --> 31:17.659
ANDREWS:
Thank you, Your Honor.

31:17.700 --> 31:21.079
Is that a picture
of your wife, there?

31:21.110 --> 31:22.509
No.

31:23.540 --> 31:25.599
Sorry. Thank you.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.641
So. "Swishiness."

31:33.590 --> 31:34.249
No.

31:34.290 --> 31:36.178
But Jackie won't listen to me.

31:36.220 --> 31:38.359
I'm not talking to her
about campaign events.

31:38.390 --> 31:39.220
Alicia...

31:39.260 --> 31:41.228
CARY:
They're not gonna pursue this.

31:41.260 --> 31:42.420
IfI have a record,

31:42.460 --> 31:44.496
I'm never gonna be able
to get a nursing job.

31:44.530 --> 31:46.191
Prostitution is
a class four felony.

31:46.230 --> 31:49.267
Because you have
no priors...

31:49.300 --> 31:50.437
Look, I'm just asking you

31:50.470 --> 31:52.358
to help me keep her
on the reservation.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.536
I have no leverage
over her; you do.

31:53.570 --> 31:55.231
When did all these favors
start multiplying?

31:55.280 --> 31:57.202
Oh, right.
How'd it go with Maddie?

31:57.240 --> 31:59.049
Okay. I have to work.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.116
You want to keep Jackie in line,
give her something.

32:01.150 --> 32:02.674
What do you mean?

32:02.720 --> 32:04.187
Something that makes
her feel valued.

32:04.220 --> 32:05.539
Important. Useful.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.012
But she is none
of those things.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.711
A point you made clear to her.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.648
Now... un-make it.

32:10.690 --> 32:12.658
(phone rings,
cell phone buzzes)

32:12.690 --> 32:15.022
Yeah, who's this?
Alicia Florrick's desk.

32:15.060 --> 32:16.027
We'll get you probation.
ELI:
What?

32:16.060 --> 32:17.197
Okay.
You keep your nose clean.

32:17.230 --> 32:18.720
No, no, Kalinda's on it.
That's great!

32:18.770 --> 32:20.567
You wait a few years,
you come back...
Just make sure
you get it on tape.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.535
And get the file over to me as
soon as you can.
It'll be like
the arrest never happened.

32:24.570 --> 32:25.969
No, he should be cooperative.
Yes, of course,
not a problem.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.136
He doesn't want a...
What?

32:27.170 --> 32:29.479
Do you need me
to talk louder?

32:29.510 --> 32:30.408
No, this should
pick it up.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.499
Um, thanks, this really
helps with my notes.

32:32.550 --> 32:34.643
Oh, no problem.
I have nothing to hide.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.170
You said you slept with

32:36.220 --> 32:39.610
Peter Florrick at his suite
at the St. Martin Hotel

32:39.650 --> 32:42.255
on September the 30th.
Yes.

32:42.290 --> 32:44.622
And how did you guys meet?
Well, there was a rally

32:44.660 --> 32:46.287
at the Springfield
Fairgrounds that day,

32:46.330 --> 32:47.581
I volunteered to
register voters.

32:47.630 --> 32:50.258
Peter and I just kind
of... hit it off.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.029
What did you talk about?

32:52.070 --> 32:53.389
Oh, stuff.

32:53.430 --> 32:55.091
I said I was hoping
to go to law school.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.596
He gave me his room number,

32:56.640 --> 33:00.007
told me to swing by after 10:00
to discuss career options.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.508
And this is was room
on the 15th floor?

33:02.540 --> 33:03.507
Yes.
And you're on?

33:03.540 --> 33:06.145
Oh, the eighth floor.
A” the workers were.

33:06.180 --> 33:09.638
Okay. So you went up
to his suite at what time?

33:09.680 --> 33:11.181
Around 11:00, I guess.

33:11.220 --> 33:13.711
And did you have a key
to hisN room?
0.

33:13.750 --> 33:15.559
The plan was just
to knock on his door,

33:15.590 --> 33:17.114
and he would let me in.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.422
Okay, good.

33:18.460 --> 33:20.678
Oh, uh, was anybody else
with you in the elevator

33:20.730 --> 33:22.095
when you went up?

33:22.130 --> 33:23.688
No, I made sure I was alone.

33:23.730 --> 33:25.698
I didn't want anyone
else to see me.

33:25.730 --> 33:26.594
Of course.

33:26.630 --> 33:30.760
Uh, how did you get
the concierge key?

33:30.800 --> 33:34.201
How did I...?
What do you mean?

33:34.240 --> 33:37.038
The concierge key--
how-how did you get it?

33:37.080 --> 33:39.640
I don't know what that is.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.409
You pushed
for the 15th floor, right?

33:41.450 --> 33:44.214
When you went into the elevator,
you didn't do anything else.

33:44.250 --> 33:46.138
Right.
See, the problem is,

33:46.190 --> 33:48.283
Mr. Florrick was staying on
the concierge floor,

33:48.320 --> 33:50.515
and you can't gain access
to that floor

33:50.560 --> 33:52.152
unless you have
a special card key,

33:52.190 --> 33:55.159
or unless you went up with
someone in the elevator who did.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.760
But I was there.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.667
No, you weren't.
You couldn't have been.

34:00.700 --> 34:02.759
Well, wait, maybe there was
someone else on the elevator,

34:02.800 --> 34:04.768
going to the 15th floor.

34:04.810 --> 34:07.665
Indira, you're lying.
No, I'm not.

34:07.710 --> 34:09.177
Yes, you are.

34:09.210 --> 34:10.632
Okay, you know what?

34:10.680 --> 34:12.602
I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

34:12.650 --> 34:15.118
I think it's fairly clear

34:15.150 --> 34:17.243
that Ms. Starr has
fabricated this story.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.441
Or she simply forgot about
the concierge key.

34:19.490 --> 34:21.378
Or she's really an alien
impersonating Miss Starr.

34:21.420 --> 34:22.853
Either way,
I think you're

34:22.890 --> 34:25.085
a little too close
to this story, Mandy.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.051
So are you.

34:26.090 --> 34:28.422
RICHARD: The tape's not
conclusive either way.

34:28.460 --> 34:32.226
Ms. Sharma, what did you observe
about Ms. Starr's demeanor?

34:32.270 --> 34:33.259
She was nervous.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.734
Covering for an obvious gap
in the narrative.

34:35.770 --> 34:36.794
So in your opinion?

34:36.840 --> 34:37.693
She was lying.

34:37.740 --> 34:39.708
I don't have any doubt it.
MANDY:
I do.

34:39.740 --> 34:41.833
There are other indicia
of reliability here.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.769
Merely because an investigator
with an agenda

34:44.810 --> 34:46.641
catches a young girl up
in an inconsistency...

34:46.680 --> 34:49.717
Richard, can I have a word?

34:49.750 --> 34:51.889
Look, I played ball.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.410
I made the Florricks
available.

34:53.450 --> 34:55.486
Peter sat down with Mandy twice.

34:55.520 --> 34:56.589
We appreciate that.

34:56.620 --> 34:58.827
Then you should appreciate
that they denied the affair.

34:58.860 --> 34:59.827
At the end of the day,
all you have is

34:59.860 --> 35:02.249
some young woman's
uncorroborated allegations

35:02.300 --> 35:03.892
which we have gutted.

35:03.930 --> 35:05.625
Here's where you tell me

35:05.670 --> 35:07.467
you have a lawsuit waiting
in the wings.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.694
Oh, I wouldn't
insult you, Richard.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.833
This isn't your first time
at the rodeo.

35:10.870 --> 35:12.235
And it's not mine.

35:12.270 --> 35:15.376
What this comes down to
is facts.

35:15.410 --> 35:17.537
And you don't have them.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.810
ALICIA:
So you're serving time
for drowning Tre Lawson?

35:24.850 --> 35:26.283
CROCKE'I'I':
Yes.

35:26.320 --> 35:27.844
Your friend says
you didn't like him.

35:27.890 --> 35:30.381
Yes, it's true,
I didn't like Tre.

35:30.420 --> 35:31.557
Why not?

35:31.590 --> 35:32.557
He was cheap.

35:32.590 --> 35:34.854
He'd make snide comments
about people's clothing.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.356
Whine about
two-a-day practices.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.753
Anything else?

35:37.800 --> 35:38.619
He was arrogant.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.366
Treated me like
I wasn't black enough.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.469
What does that mean?

35:42.500 --> 35:43.637
I come from
the suburbs.

35:43.670 --> 35:45.661
He's from
the South Side of Chicago.

35:45.710 --> 35:49.407
He'd call me an Oreo.
Say I'm not authentic.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.704
Did any of your hostility
towards him stem from

35:51.750 --> 35:55.379
behavior you thought
was eflf\leminate?
o.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.810
My only problem with Tre
was that he was a jerk.

35:58.850 --> 35:59.942
Thank you.

35:59.990 --> 36:02.208
ANDREWS:
"Oreo."

36:02.260 --> 36:04.956
Used like that, it's mighty
offensive, isn't it?

36:04.990 --> 36:06.457
Yeah.

36:06.490 --> 36:09.197
Which fraternity
did you belong to?

36:09.230 --> 36:11.323
Omega Delta Omega.

36:11.370 --> 36:12.689
The black fraternity, right?

36:12.730 --> 36:13.628
Yes.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.490
Would you say the kids
in your fraternity

36:15.540 --> 36:18.304
are light-skinned like
you or dark-skinned like Tre?

36:18.340 --> 36:19.534
DIANE:
Your Honor, objection.

36:19.570 --> 36:22.778
What hate crime is the defense
selling today?

36:22.810 --> 36:23.970
Black-on-black.

36:24.010 --> 36:25.978
Wow, they're
just relentless.

36:26.010 --> 36:27.602
He has a theory of the case

36:27.650 --> 36:29.538
and he's looking for the facts
to satisfy it.

36:29.580 --> 36:30.569
Unfortunately,
thejudgeis

36:30.620 --> 36:32.281
letting him run
with it.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.208
So black-on-black
hate crime? Hmm.

36:34.260 --> 36:35.716
And you think
there's truth to it?

36:35.760 --> 36:36.852
They were in
rival fraternities,

36:36.890 --> 36:38.323
and _there_were
preVIous fights.

36:38.360 --> 36:41.750
But that's good.
Why? What do you mean?

36:41.800 --> 36:42.994
It's good that
there were fights.

36:43.030 --> 36:44.429
You're losing me.

36:44.470 --> 36:45.823
This isn't about
a hate crime.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.361
This is about liability.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.935
Put the coach back on the stand.

36:53.970 --> 36:56.370
I'll take him.

37:04.490 --> 37:06.378
Coach Shank,
in its 50-year existence,

37:06.420 --> 37:09.287
the water polo team
never had members of both

37:09.320 --> 37:12.687
Omega Delta Omega
and Pi Gamma Phi on its roster

37:12.730 --> 37:14.459
at the same time.
Why is that?

37:14.500 --> 37:17.492
We've only had a handful
of black athletes

37:17.530 --> 37:18.963
in the program's history.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.592
So you weren't aware
of animosity

37:20.630 --> 37:22.268
between these two fraternities?

37:22.300 --> 37:22.891
I was not.

37:22.940 --> 37:25.636
This is a 2008 report

37:25.670 --> 37:28.901
by CPT's J.A.
citing Pi Gamma Phi

37:28.940 --> 37:31.738
and Omega Delta Omega
for their role in

37:31.780 --> 37:33.805
a bowling alley brawl.

37:33.850 --> 37:36.876
Is that you on
the distribution list?

37:36.920 --> 37:39.639
Yeah. But I don't remember
receivmg it.

37:39.690 --> 37:40.748
Were you aware

37:40.790 --> 37:43.418
that Wayne Crockett was a member
of Omega Delta Omega?

37:43.460 --> 37:45.428
Yes.
Were you aware that

37:45.460 --> 37:48.918
Tre Lawson pledged Pi Gamma Phi
a week before his death?

37:48.960 --> 37:50.689
No.

37:50.730 --> 37:52.698
This picture

37:52.730 --> 37:58.600
was posted on Tre Lawson's
Facebook memorial page.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.507
It's a photo of a recent
team practice, right?

38:01.540 --> 38:02.973
Yeah.

38:03.010 --> 38:05.843
The person just to your left
is Tre Lawson.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.745
Could you tell the jury

38:07.780 --> 38:10.340
what the insignia
on his shirt says?

38:12.750 --> 38:14.411
Pi Gamma Phi.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.883
Your Honor, I'm not sure what
Ms. Lockhart's point is.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.320
Mr. Andrews convinced the
court to let him present

38:19.360 --> 38:22.591
his black-on-black hate
crime theory to the jury.

38:22.630 --> 38:24.097
So if Coach Shank knew

38:24.130 --> 38:25.791
that the victim and
perpetrator belonged

38:25.830 --> 38:26.922
to_ rival
organizations...

38:26.970 --> 38:27.959
Wait a minute.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.332
You can't prove Mr. Crockett
drowned Mr. Lawson

38:30.370 --> 38:31.564
because he was black.

38:31.610 --> 38:32.736
Actually, Mr. Andrews,

38:32.770 --> 38:34.977
you already did.

38:35.010 --> 38:37.376
A|| Ms. Lockhart proved

38:37.410 --> 38:39.378
was that the university knew
about the animus.

38:41.450 --> 38:43.077
Step back.

38:46.620 --> 38:48.986
(quietly):
How much?

38:49.020 --> 38:51.557
$6 million.
Our original ask.

38:54.660 --> 38:56.491
(sighs)

38:56.530 --> 38:58.566
WILL:
You seem pretty happy
with yourself.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.694
I like the law.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.935
(chuckles)

39:03.970 --> 39:06.006
We're gonna get
our firm back.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.975
Then we're gonna go after
Louis Canning's firm,

39:09.010 --> 39:10.978
then we're gonna open up
a branch in New York

39:11.010 --> 39:12.978
and DC

39:13.010 --> 39:15.672
It feels pretty good,
doesn't it?

39:15.720 --> 39:17.870
What's that, winning?

39:17.920 --> 39:18.989
No. Nothing to lose.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.718
Welcome to the lifeboat.

39:28.630 --> 39:30.029
(sighs)

39:33.030 --> 39:36.466
(rock and roll music playing)

39:44.040 --> 39:45.940
ELI:
Okay, you hand them
the T-shirts,

39:45.980 --> 39:47.572
you give them the tickets,

39:47.610 --> 39:49.441
you walk them to the
ballot. Understand?

39:49.480 --> 39:51.072
Do not take anyone
for granted.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.417
WOMAN:
Eli, it's Mandy.

39:52.450 --> 39:53.849
You walk them all the way.

39:53.890 --> 39:55.517
Okay, spread out.

39:57.820 --> 39:59.651
Two months I worked
on that story, Eli.

39:59.690 --> 40:02.056
You managed to kill it with
one conversation. Nice work.

40:02.100 --> 40:05.422
Oh, Mandy, I know you think
I must relish this moment,

40:05.470 --> 40:07.768
but it gives me no pleasure
wasting my time

40:07.800 --> 40:09.961
to prove you wasted yours.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.501
(elevator bell dings)
Here, have a sausage.

40:11.540 --> 40:12.939
She was a naive
25-year-old,

40:12.970 --> 40:14.039
who was overcome
by the occa5ion.

40:14.070 --> 40:16.072
I still stand
by my story.

40:16.110 --> 40:17.099
Mm-hmm. Really?
I gotta go.

40:19.650 --> 40:22.710
Hello, Alicia.

40:22.750 --> 40:23.944
Jackie.

40:23.980 --> 40:25.538
The two of us, I know

40:25.590 --> 40:28.150
we haven't always
seen eye to eye,

40:28.190 --> 40:31.626
but I just want you
to know how much...

40:31.660 --> 40:34.891
I'm sorry I doubted
you, Alicia.

40:34.930 --> 40:36.795
Standing by Peter
the way you're doing.

40:36.830 --> 40:38.149
He needs you now.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.724
(voice breaks):
And I'm just...

40:39.770 --> 40:40.998
I'm just so glad
you're there for him.

40:41.030 --> 40:44.830
Thank you... Jackie.

40:52.010 --> 40:53.170
Jackie?

40:53.210 --> 40:56.008
What?

40:56.050 --> 40:57.176
Are you okay?

41:00.990 --> 41:03.652
(phone buzzes)

41:06.860 --> 41:07.929
Hello?

41:07.960 --> 41:09.825
MAN:
Mr. Eli Gold?
Who's this?

41:09.860 --> 41:12.260
Jimmy V.
I run a political blog.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.222
Oh, well, let me get you
our press secretary.

41:14.270 --> 41:15.897
No, that's all right.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.168
I'm about to publish
a story saying

41:17.200 --> 41:19.031
a national magazine
is sitting on a piece

41:19.070 --> 41:22.233
accusing Peter Florrick of
sleeping with a campaign worker.

41:22.280 --> 41:26.842
I'd like to get a quote
from the campaign.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.973
Did I lose you?
No.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.146
Where are you getting this?

41:30.180 --> 41:33.513
An anonymous tip.
I see.

41:33.550 --> 41:37.213
Well, it's a lie
and it's defamatory.

41:37.260 --> 41:39.228
And if I were you, Jimmy V.,

41:39.260 --> 41:42.093
I would take a breath before
you post anything actionable.

41:42.130 --> 41:44.052
Is that your quote?

41:44.100 --> 41:45.226
What's the blog?

41:45.270 --> 41:47.226
PoorAnarchy.com.
All one word.

41:47.270 --> 41:48.532
Never heard of it.

41:48.570 --> 41:50.765
You will.
In about one hour.
