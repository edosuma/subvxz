WEBVTT

00:01.479 --> 00:03.612
- I know what Jeremy is doing.
- Alcohol is not illegal.

00:03.655 --> 00:04.961
- Dealing Oxy is.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.354
- What can you tell me
about my mom?

00:06.397 --> 00:07.964
She was from Deep Lake,
that's all I know

00:08.008 --> 00:09.966
about my birth parents.
- I was barely 17.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.316
Then I got pregnant.
I had to walk away from Jeremy.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.883
But in the end,
it didn't matter,

00:13.926 --> 00:16.581
because 8 weeks in,
I had a miscarriage.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.714
- I'm so sorry Devon,
but I can't marry you.

00:18.757 --> 00:21.108
- I get why you came
up here now.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.065
You're running from something.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.154
- My Mom died of cancer.

00:24.198 --> 00:25.938
I have the BRCA1 gene.

00:25.982 --> 00:28.071
I don't think I can run anymore.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.030
- You're gonna keep hurting
people until you deal with it.

00:33.337 --> 00:34.860
- Come on, Ems.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.906
We could both use a night out
that doesn't involve boys.

00:37.602 --> 00:40.344
Boys that we already know.
[chuckling]

00:41.867 --> 00:44.305
[country music]

00:44.827 --> 00:47.177
I heard you have a shot here
that brings good luck.

00:47.221 --> 00:48.831
We could use some.

00:54.358 --> 00:56.143
Um, what is that?

00:56.186 --> 00:58.449
- Buckey's thumb.
Prohibition rum running.

00:58.493 --> 01:01.539
Had horseshoes up his ass
'till he lost that thumb.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.541
Good luck if you let it touch
your lips.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.288
- Ugh.

01:12.376 --> 01:13.247
- Oh.

01:14.683 --> 01:15.771
It's not that bad.

01:15.814 --> 01:19.253
- Yeah, alcohol kills leprosy,
right?

01:20.471 --> 01:21.951
[laughing]

01:27.826 --> 01:29.393
[grunts]

01:29.437 --> 01:31.700
Okay, I know why
I need better luck.

01:31.743 --> 01:35.878
Why do you? Is it a boy?
Is it Bodie?

01:36.792 --> 01:37.619
- I'm...

01:38.707 --> 01:40.100
I'm waiting for
some test results.

01:41.579 --> 01:42.841
I haven't seen Bodie since--

01:42.885 --> 01:44.147
[gasping]

01:44.191 --> 01:46.018
- Oh, God, he swallowed
the thumb!

01:47.411 --> 01:49.979
My name's Emma, I'm a nurse.
You need the Heimlich maneuver.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.983
- He's cyanotic!
He's passing out.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.855
- Starting chest compressions.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.509
Call 911!
- There's no time.

01:58.553 --> 02:00.990
He needs an emergency
cricothyrotomy.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.644
- Here?

02:02.687 --> 02:03.906
- This is the North, Emma.

02:03.949 --> 02:06.213
We make do with what we have
or people die.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.434
We need a sterile blade
and a straw.

02:12.697 --> 02:16.092
Okay, now we just need to make
a half inch vertical incision

02:16.136 --> 02:17.311
under his Adam's apple.

02:17.354 --> 02:18.790
- Are we sure we should
be doing this?

02:18.834 --> 02:20.488
- Indecision kills.

02:22.185 --> 02:25.101
[suspenseful music]

02:25.754 --> 02:27.582
- Okay, the yellow membrane.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.236
That's the cricothyroid
membrane.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.151
We'll have to slice
it horizontally.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.765
- Okay.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.289
Okay. Now put this straw
into the trachea.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.948
Now we need to administer
two steady breaths,

02:45.991 --> 02:47.167
about a second each.

02:53.956 --> 02:55.784
[gasping]

02:55.827 --> 02:57.873
[applause]

02:57.916 --> 03:01.703
- Holy crap, Hayley.
We just did a cric.

03:01.746 --> 03:02.878
- Told you it was lucky.

03:06.229 --> 03:09.101
[epic music]

03:16.239 --> 03:18.720
[upbeat music, laughing]

03:20.635 --> 03:22.463
- Would you call
that decorticate,

03:22.506 --> 03:24.334
or decerebrate posturing?

03:24.378 --> 03:26.118
- Whoa, if you do not know that,

03:26.162 --> 03:27.772
you are not ready for
your interview.

03:28.643 --> 03:31.167
We call that posturing...
perfection.

03:31.907 --> 03:35.389
- Dang. I was hoping for
your sake it was involuntary.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.741
- Hey. You're gonna crush it,
Crys.

03:40.524 --> 03:43.353
You're exactly the kind
of smart, talented

03:43.397 --> 03:45.094
future med student U of M
is looking for.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.835
- Wanna fly out to Winnipeg
with me and just keep

03:46.878 --> 03:49.011
repeating all that?
- Oh, come on.

03:52.362 --> 03:55.235
Listen. Winnipeg Memorial's
been trying to poach me

03:55.278 --> 03:56.279
for a while now.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.412
They have a pretty good ER.

03:58.455 --> 03:59.978
And it would be nice
to live somewhere

04:00.022 --> 04:02.154
with more than
one grocery store again.

04:06.115 --> 04:07.638
Maybe we can make
the move together.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.598
- This will be great Bodes,
just like old times.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.382
- Didn't make sense to keep
a lease on the house

04:12.426 --> 04:13.688
without Madison, so...

04:14.384 --> 04:15.603
Does everyone know about...

04:16.560 --> 04:17.648
what happened?

04:17.692 --> 04:19.259
- Oh, come on.
Nobody cares about that.

04:19.737 --> 04:23.219
Most people don't care
about that, just, look,

04:23.263 --> 04:25.221
we're happy to have you back,
Bodie. Alright?

04:27.571 --> 04:29.965
- Shit. I forgot...

04:30.008 --> 04:31.401
- That's okay. Look...

04:31.445 --> 04:33.882
your heating vent works
a little too well in there,

04:33.925 --> 04:35.013
I was sweating my ass off.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.407
It's all good, I'm gonna move
back to my room,

04:37.451 --> 04:38.408
it'll be more comfy.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.409
- Chops.

04:41.716 --> 04:42.934
Thank you, man.

04:43.544 --> 04:46.329
- Yeah.
- Does anybody want a latte?

04:46.373 --> 04:48.549
I splurged on the fanciest beans
they had at the Tiger,

04:48.592 --> 04:51.813
so it is medium roast lattes
all around...

04:56.774 --> 05:02.258
Um... I think I forgot
the milk in the car.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.783
- I thought everyone knew
I was moving back?

05:08.917 --> 05:10.266
- Emma broke off her engagement.

05:13.574 --> 05:14.618
- Because of...

05:15.793 --> 05:17.186
You call her?
- No.

05:17.229 --> 05:19.144
What am I gonna say, "Sorry I
ruined your wedding,

05:19.188 --> 05:20.320
let's grab a pizza?"

05:21.408 --> 05:23.105
[sighs]
- Relationships suck.

05:23.148 --> 05:24.585
- Mm. Relationships
in Thompson suck.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.935
- Thompson sucks.

05:27.762 --> 05:30.460
- I need that omelette
for table 3.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.984
And we need the guy to come fix
the cappuccino machine.

05:35.770 --> 05:36.597
- Um, Madison.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.815
[sighs]

05:38.947 --> 05:40.601
I was hoping we could talk.

05:40.644 --> 05:41.863
Look, I'm sorry

05:41.906 --> 05:45.214
for what Bodie and I, um...

05:46.520 --> 05:48.217
For what I did.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.262
It was a mistake
and I feel awful.

05:50.306 --> 05:51.263
- Screw off.

05:53.091 --> 05:54.397
- What?

05:54.441 --> 05:56.312
- Screw. Off.

05:57.226 --> 05:58.314
I'm trying to clean up
my language

05:58.358 --> 05:59.446
before the baby gets here.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.056
- Look, I'm trying
to apologize--

06:01.099 --> 06:02.318
- No you aren't.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.277
You wanna apologize for you.

06:06.278 --> 06:08.019
So that you feel better.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.413
[scoffs]

06:10.457 --> 06:14.156
If you really gave a crap
about me or how I'm feeling,

06:14.199 --> 06:15.723
you wouldn't be here
putting me through this

06:15.766 --> 06:19.596
at work making it all about you.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.381
Well guess what, Hayley?

06:21.424 --> 06:23.600
I don't give a shit
if you feel better.

06:30.085 --> 06:32.304
- Hey, Nowak. Got three more
orders here.

06:33.654 --> 06:34.916
- Hey.
- Gin and tonic.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.614
That's not what you ordered,
is it?

06:39.007 --> 06:42.489
Sorry, picking up doubles
at the bar and working

06:42.532 --> 06:44.229
extra in the medevac.

06:46.841 --> 06:48.059
- No Bodie tonight?

06:48.103 --> 06:50.235
- No, he's uh...
settling in his old room.

06:56.894 --> 06:57.982
Sorry, I--

06:59.375 --> 07:01.072
[chuckles]
- Hey.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.117
- Emma.

07:02.509 --> 07:05.207
You're... Emma.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.948
In Thompson.

07:06.991 --> 07:09.690
- Yeah. I'm on my days off,
Hayley invited me

07:09.733 --> 07:11.169
to stay at the crew house, so.

07:11.213 --> 07:13.737
- I, uh, I must have just
missed you, I...

07:14.738 --> 07:16.523
I got in late last night.

07:16.566 --> 07:19.613
- Um, were you out with someone?

07:20.788 --> 07:23.921
- You know, Cassiopeia.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.706
[laughing]

07:25.749 --> 07:27.490
- Yeah, it's kind of hard
to compete with her.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.102
- So, how's single life
treating you?

07:31.146 --> 07:33.714
- It's great. It's...

07:34.976 --> 07:36.804
kind of boring actually.

07:38.109 --> 07:43.114
Just have all this free time
with nothing to do, so...

07:45.726 --> 07:48.468
[upbeat music]

08:07.617 --> 08:09.576
- Hey. You okay?

08:11.839 --> 08:14.363
- Had my med school
interview today.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.975
Went... really well.

08:18.715 --> 08:21.762
- No offence, Crys,
but if this is how you look

08:21.805 --> 08:23.198
when things go really well...

08:24.678 --> 08:26.070
- Doing this means leaving.

08:27.376 --> 08:31.467
Again. And for much longer.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.557
And... Trevor wants to make
the move together.

08:35.819 --> 08:40.084
- Ugh. God. Super hot doctor
who wants to commit?

08:40.128 --> 08:42.260
[scoffs]
The worst.

08:43.000 --> 08:43.871
- It's...

08:44.785 --> 08:46.047
it's just a lot of change.

08:46.874 --> 08:48.092
- You worked hard for this,
Crys.

08:48.832 --> 08:51.661
Maybe take one second
to celebrate.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.494
- You hear back about
your MRI yet?

08:59.843 --> 09:00.801
- No.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.848
They don't have champagne here,
but I'm gonna get us

09:04.892 --> 09:07.155
two pints of their bubbliest
draft and we are gonna

09:07.198 --> 09:08.765
make a toast to you,
Dr. Highway.

09:11.202 --> 09:12.073
- Was that okay?

09:13.248 --> 09:14.379
God, Chopper, of course,
it wasn't okay,

09:14.423 --> 09:15.990
you just did it in a bathroom.

09:16.033 --> 09:16.904
[sighs]

09:17.426 --> 09:20.472
- That... was awesome.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.823
I've always wanted to,
you know...

09:22.866 --> 09:24.607
In like somewhere...

09:26.957 --> 09:28.263
- Uh, public?

09:30.352 --> 09:33.398
Wait... you haven't
hooked up anywhere?

09:33.442 --> 09:35.923
Like a concert or a car or...

09:35.966 --> 09:37.011
- Nope.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.100
Devon and I got together
really young.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.147
So I was thinking, maybe we
could do something like...

09:43.191 --> 09:44.279
Like a bucket list!

09:45.062 --> 09:46.455
- I could be into that.

09:46.498 --> 09:50.633
Why don't we go to dinner
and talk about it there?

09:51.895 --> 09:54.898
- I was thinking something
a little more casual.

09:54.942 --> 09:57.771
It's just, I just got out of
an engagement and...

09:59.424 --> 10:00.774
I don't think I could
really handle anything

10:00.817 --> 10:02.079
more serious right now.

10:03.124 --> 10:06.301
- Yeah, no, yeah. That's right.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.608
- But hey, that doesn't mean
you have to do this.

10:09.696 --> 10:12.220
If you're not down for it.
- No, no.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.527
I am down. For sure.

10:15.571 --> 10:17.225
- Really? Yeah?

10:17.921 --> 10:19.444
Because I wanna try...

10:26.930 --> 10:28.279
[sighs]

10:36.113 --> 10:37.332
- We're about ten away.

10:38.986 --> 10:40.335
If I'm lucky I'll get my sleep
requirements before I'm on call.

10:40.378 --> 10:44.078
- Not until I get some details
from tonight.

10:44.121 --> 10:46.123
I heard someone was hooking up

10:46.167 --> 10:47.777
in the Whiskey Hatch bathroom.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.866
- No idea, I didn't see a thing

10:49.910 --> 10:51.476
past the taps and the tip jar.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.782
- Well, it wasn't Bodie.

10:53.304 --> 10:54.566
Neither Madison or Hayley

10:54.610 --> 10:56.046
are talking to him.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.831
They're not talking to each
other either.

10:58.396 --> 11:01.922
Which is sad. I like Madison.
She was fun to have around.

11:04.838 --> 11:05.665
Nowak?

11:06.535 --> 11:07.362
Babe?

11:08.276 --> 11:09.320
[glass shattering]

11:09.799 --> 11:10.887
Nowak?!

11:11.671 --> 11:12.715
Nowak!

11:13.803 --> 11:16.676
[suspenseful music]

11:29.558 --> 11:31.255
[grunts]

11:32.996 --> 11:35.433
[panting]

11:40.656 --> 11:42.658
[grunting]

11:46.618 --> 11:48.795
[suspenseful music]

12:09.337 --> 12:12.427
- Oh God, he went off the road!
Nowak!

12:12.470 --> 12:14.081
- Nowak!

12:15.343 --> 12:16.431
- I'm over here!

12:17.214 --> 12:19.129
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.873
- You can't get the door open?

12:24.178 --> 12:25.614
We've got you, man.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.182
- Okay, okay, we're coming
for you, bro.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.967
[grunting]

12:32.229 --> 12:33.709
- Lexi... my seatbelt.

12:35.406 --> 12:36.886
I'm stuck.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.194
- I got it. Tristan.

12:40.237 --> 12:42.500
- Where are you hurt?
- My shoulder.

12:44.285 --> 12:45.808
- Do you have any neck
or back pain?

12:45.852 --> 12:46.722
- No.

12:47.549 --> 12:48.637
- I got you.

12:49.725 --> 12:53.381
Come on. Come on. Almost out.

12:55.557 --> 12:56.688
Okay.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.082
Oh my God.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.302
- I'm okay.

13:01.345 --> 13:02.825
I'm okay.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.827
- Okay, you've got
a dislocated shoulder,

13:04.871 --> 13:06.002
it's painful but it can wait.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.874
Let me get a good look at you.
- No, no.

13:07.917 --> 13:10.224
No, I got it, I got it.
- Nowak, I can't do

13:10.267 --> 13:12.182
a reduction, you need
to go to the hospital.

13:12.226 --> 13:13.575
- It's happened before,
I got it.

13:13.618 --> 13:14.794
- What are you talking about?

13:16.360 --> 13:17.274
What are you doing?

13:17.318 --> 13:18.623
[grunts]

13:18.667 --> 13:19.842
Oh my God!

13:20.625 --> 13:22.323
- So that's how
we're playing it, huh?

13:23.019 --> 13:25.500
I'll call an ambulance
and a tow truck.

13:25.543 --> 13:28.068
- It's already off the road,
the tow truck can wait.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.853
- What about the ambulance?
- I just...

13:30.897 --> 13:34.117
I'm fine. I just wanna go
home and sleep.

13:34.988 --> 13:35.902
- Are you serious?

13:36.728 --> 13:37.991
Are you serious?!

13:47.261 --> 13:49.089
On the bed.
[groaning]

13:51.308 --> 13:53.702
- I'm digging the butch vibes.
- Sit still, since you're

13:53.745 --> 13:55.269
too stubborn to go
to the hospital.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.445
Look at me,
we need to check you out.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.664
- You know you're adorable
when you're angry.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.712
- You've been working
crazy hours.

14:03.755 --> 14:05.061
It's catching up to
you.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.586
[soft music]

14:10.762 --> 14:11.720
- Tris...

14:12.852 --> 14:15.811
I'm fine. Okay?

14:17.421 --> 14:18.596
All good.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.035
Daj mi buzi?

14:23.253 --> 14:26.735
- You're not dying.
You're just annoying.

14:26.778 --> 14:27.867
[laughing]

14:32.741 --> 14:34.003
- I'm gonna shower.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.027
[suspenseful music]

15:02.249 --> 15:05.556
[accelerating heart rate]

15:07.297 --> 15:09.647
- Did you manage to sleep at all
when we got home last night?

15:09.691 --> 15:11.867
I'm tired and I didn't
even wreck my car.

15:13.129 --> 15:15.697
- Hey, you know me.
Strong like bull.

15:17.960 --> 15:18.961
- What's this?

15:19.005 --> 15:20.180
[beeping]

15:20.223 --> 15:21.659
- Stop touching things.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.185
[sighs]

15:30.016 --> 15:31.191
- Come on, tell me a story.

15:31.974 --> 15:32.975
Entertain me.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.499
- It was a quiet flight.
The end.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.992
- How you doin', Jer?
- Not...

15:50.036 --> 15:51.646
Whoa! Better than you,
apparently.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.213
What's this? What happened?

15:53.256 --> 15:55.302
- Stunt on my snow cat. I need
a little bit more practise.

15:55.345 --> 15:57.130
- Hey, be more careful
than this one, huh?

15:57.173 --> 15:59.088
I don't need two patients
on my hands.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.569
- You wanna play some
Super Smash Bros later?

16:01.612 --> 16:04.180
- Yeah. Am I gonna come to find
you ate all my chips playing it

16:04.224 --> 16:06.182
while I was gone?
[laughing]

16:06.966 --> 16:08.097
Yeah, come.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.794
Come by later,
I'll go easy on ya.

16:09.838 --> 16:10.926
- Alright.
- Alright, Lefty?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.058
[chuckling]

16:13.668 --> 16:16.497
- Come on, Crys. Chew me out
for not getting out of Dodge,

16:16.540 --> 16:18.934
alright, throw something,
call me an asshole,

16:18.978 --> 16:20.283
anything, just...

16:20.327 --> 16:22.024
But the silent treatment,
it isn't you.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.072
- I'm leaving.

16:28.813 --> 16:31.773
I applied to med school.
And if I get in, I'm going.

16:33.166 --> 16:33.993
- Wow.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.084
So just like that, huh?

16:39.694 --> 16:40.738
You're running away again.

16:46.179 --> 16:47.397
- I'm not running away.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.444
I'm doing this
so I can come back.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.795
As a doctor for the community.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.144
- Yeah, am I supposed
to be what?

16:55.188 --> 16:57.407
Grateful that you're telling
me this time?

16:57.451 --> 16:59.496
Instead of just running away
in the middle of the night?

16:59.540 --> 17:01.672
- No, I didn't--
- You did.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.065
One minute we were having
a baby together,

17:03.109 --> 17:05.850
and the next, you were gone.

17:11.639 --> 17:14.424
After what we lost.
You've just...

17:16.296 --> 17:17.123
You left.

17:24.521 --> 17:25.522
- No, we were...

17:26.480 --> 17:28.786
We were never having
a baby together.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.833
I was having a baby.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.923
And you were just the guy
who got me pregnant.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.709
[sombre music]

17:46.108 --> 17:49.938
You were 17, partying too hard.
And smuggling bootleg.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.114
Like, who do you think
was gonna raise our kid?

18:06.346 --> 18:07.999
- That day you told me
you were pregnant...

18:09.697 --> 18:12.830
I went down to Prospect River
and I applied

18:12.874 --> 18:14.354
at the nickel mine

18:14.397 --> 18:16.095
for a real job.

18:18.706 --> 18:19.707
For you.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.625
It's always been you, Crys.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.932
- Jer...
- Even when you're not here,

18:27.976 --> 18:29.064
even when you're mad at me.

18:31.936 --> 18:32.763
It's you.

18:58.049 --> 19:01.401
[dramatic music]

20:08.468 --> 20:11.253
- Wow. An actual
sex bucket list.

20:13.690 --> 20:14.517
Whoa.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.174
- I'd like to call
your attention to number four.

20:20.697 --> 20:21.524
And 11.

20:22.699 --> 20:25.180
- Hey, do you want
to order some food?

20:26.616 --> 20:29.010
There's a new dumpling place
in town and I was thinking

20:29.053 --> 20:31.230
we could eat dinner in bed.

20:32.927 --> 20:36.365
- Um, thanks, but I'm gonna
crash with Hayley.

20:36.409 --> 20:37.975
I have an early start
tomorrow, so--

20:38.019 --> 20:39.803
- Yeah, no, cool.
[chuckles]

20:40.717 --> 20:42.066
Well, uh...

20:43.154 --> 20:45.896
Thank you. For that.

20:49.813 --> 20:50.858
- Number six tomorrow?

21:00.346 --> 21:03.305
- She finally ditched the zero
to get with the hero, huh?

21:03.349 --> 21:05.525
That's great, man. I knew you
liked her for a while.

21:05.568 --> 21:09.311
- Uh, no, it's not like that.
It's casual, you know?

21:11.835 --> 21:12.662
- Cool.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.362
- What?
- Nothing.

21:16.405 --> 21:17.276
I just...

21:18.973 --> 21:20.583
didn't think that's
what you wanted.

21:20.627 --> 21:23.064
- Yeah, no,
it's what we're doing.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.762
It's what we both want.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.082
[suspenseful music]

21:44.955 --> 21:46.043
- Donny, you there?

21:48.394 --> 21:49.395
- Oh shit.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.054
- Hey, Donny,
I don't feel so good.

21:57.098 --> 21:59.013
- You do this every year,
you get drunk,

21:59.056 --> 22:01.015
you go on about animal rights
and you embarrass me

22:01.058 --> 22:04.453
in front of all my friends.
- I only had one beer.

22:04.497 --> 22:07.064
- Maybe we should take
separate vacations.

22:07.108 --> 22:09.589
Maybe we should just
be separate.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.896
[groaning]

22:12.940 --> 22:14.376
[suspenseful music]

22:14.420 --> 22:15.595
[muffled]: Help.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.167
- Okay Brendan. I know
this is gonna be hard,

22:23.211 --> 22:25.561
but I need you to try
and hold still.

22:25.605 --> 22:28.085
- She said not to move.
- Uh-huh! Uh-huh.

22:28.129 --> 22:29.913
- Your face is numb?
- Uh-huh.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.262
- Do you have any numbness
anywhere else?

22:31.306 --> 22:32.742
- Uh...
- He's drunk.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.918
He said he only had one beer
but he could barely stand.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.267
He hates coming up here.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.182
[indistinct chatter]
- Okay, it's okay.

22:38.226 --> 22:40.620
Just don't try to talk.

22:41.838 --> 22:44.363
I can't pull him off without
causing further injury.

22:44.406 --> 22:48.454
- This is like murder Jenga...
It's all interlocked.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.804
- I mean, we could
try using a saw.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.371
- No saw!

22:53.502 --> 22:55.286
- Um, do you have
a wire coat hanger?

22:55.896 --> 22:57.637
[indistinct chatter]

22:58.812 --> 23:01.510
Alright, look. The antlers
aren't like bone,

23:01.554 --> 23:03.512
they're more like fingernails.

23:04.078 --> 23:04.948
Which means...

23:07.690 --> 23:08.865
...We can burn through them.

23:14.915 --> 23:15.742
- It's working.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.875
- Oh...
- Oh!

23:18.919 --> 23:20.703
Oh my God, Chopper!

23:20.747 --> 23:22.009
[coughing]

23:22.052 --> 23:24.054
Oh my God. Chopper.

23:24.968 --> 23:27.449
- Mm-hmm. Science.

23:28.189 --> 23:29.408
[grunting]

23:33.977 --> 23:37.372
- I know. That burning antler
gave me a headache too.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.287
- I've been trying to get
this smell out of here.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.076
- Alright Brendan, can you...

23:47.382 --> 23:48.557
...give my hand a squeeze?

23:49.993 --> 23:51.908
Okay Brendan, give me
a big old squeeze.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.040
- He wouldn't hold
my hand either.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.389
I thought he was just mad at me.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.394
- Right-sided hemiparesis.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.439
Ataxia, facial numbness,
slurring...

24:02.789 --> 24:04.399
I don't think he's drunk.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.922
- What is it? What's happening?

24:05.966 --> 24:07.837
- I think your partner
had a stroke.

24:07.881 --> 24:09.665
[grunting]
- Stroke?

24:10.231 --> 24:11.885
- Oh God. Brendan!
- Careful! Watch the antler.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.843
- No. Ugh!
- His jacket.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.064
- Winnipeg centre,
this is SkyMed 911 Medevac.

24:17.107 --> 24:20.154
We have a mechanical issue
on board the aircraft

24:20.197 --> 24:21.764
and need to divert
to Prospect River.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.898
[panting]

24:27.161 --> 24:28.031
[sighs]

24:30.556 --> 24:32.732
- Please, please. I know
I was a jerk before,

24:32.775 --> 24:33.863
but he has to be okay.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.038
- We're gonna get him
to Thompson

24:35.082 --> 24:36.387
as soon as we can, okay?

24:36.431 --> 24:37.824
But if the feathers had gotten
behind the panels

24:37.867 --> 24:39.782
and into the wiring,
it could have caused a fire

24:39.826 --> 24:41.436
and taken the whole plane down.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.177
We had to divert and we're
waiting for a different

24:43.220 --> 24:44.265
Medevac, okay?

24:45.919 --> 24:47.224
- Spare from the plane.

24:47.268 --> 24:48.487
[groaning]

24:48.530 --> 24:50.924
- I'm here. I'm so sorry.

24:51.707 --> 24:52.882
I know you hate these trips,

24:52.926 --> 24:54.928
I don't know why
I drag you up here.

24:54.971 --> 24:57.060
I don't know why I come up here.

24:58.409 --> 24:59.933
I never actually shot anything,

24:59.976 --> 25:03.806
I look at them and I see
their wet little eyes...

25:05.678 --> 25:07.680
I've been friends with
these guys since college.

25:07.723 --> 25:10.770
I thought this is what I had
to do to spend time with them,

25:10.813 --> 25:13.033
but I don't like
who I am with them.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.904
I like who I am with you.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.038
I'm sorry I made you think
that you had to do something

25:18.081 --> 25:20.388
you were uncomfortable with
to be with me.

25:20.431 --> 25:22.172
[grunting]

25:22.216 --> 25:23.522
[muffled]: I love you.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.175
- I love you too.

25:25.219 --> 25:30.485
- Whoa. Would we call this
an emergency touch down?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.748
- We wouldn't
if we read the room.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.489
- Patient needs a CT scan
as soon as possible.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.838
He's in the 4 hour window
for tPA.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.623
- Okay, we need to get him
hooked up the ECG

25:37.666 --> 25:39.538
and in the air.
- Bodes.

25:40.974 --> 25:42.802
Ready? Three, two...

25:44.064 --> 25:44.934
- Over here.

25:46.283 --> 25:47.154
This way.

25:48.459 --> 25:49.765
- 38-year-old male presenting
with a stroke,

25:49.809 --> 25:51.245
LAMS score of four
and a foreign object impaled

25:51.288 --> 25:52.812
through floor of mouth
behind the mandible.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.335
[ringing]

25:56.946 --> 25:58.078
- I got to...

25:58.948 --> 26:00.254
- Hey.

26:00.297 --> 26:01.298
Hey, are you okay?

26:03.474 --> 26:04.693
- Is he gonna be okay?

26:04.737 --> 26:07.000
- They're gonna do everything
that they can.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.958
[gasping]
- My chest hurts.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.830
- It's okay.
I got you, I got you.

26:11.352 --> 26:12.875
[panting]

26:12.919 --> 26:14.877
I knew I should have examined
you after the car accident.

26:14.921 --> 26:16.662
HR's high.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.272
[panting]

26:18.315 --> 26:20.056
Sats are good.

26:20.100 --> 26:23.886
Nowak, look at me. Look at me,
I need you to breathe, okay?

26:23.930 --> 26:25.453
In...

26:25.496 --> 26:26.976
and out.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.500
Slow, deep breaths, okay?

26:30.676 --> 26:34.680
- What's wrong with me? I felt
like my chest was gonna burst.

26:34.723 --> 26:35.985
- This can happen after
a car accident.

26:36.029 --> 26:36.986
Panic attacks are totally
normal--

26:37.030 --> 26:38.379
- Panic attack?

26:40.729 --> 26:44.385
No. I'm a pilot,
for Christ's sake.

26:45.952 --> 26:47.997
- Funny how pilots
are humans too, huh?

26:50.391 --> 26:53.612
I'm sending you the information
for a counsellor.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.614
He can talk you through
some coping techniques.

26:55.657 --> 26:58.791
Call him. Set up an appointment.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.096
It's not a big deal, okay?

27:00.140 --> 27:02.708
[soft music]

27:05.580 --> 27:07.495
- Why are we here?
I thought you were gonna

27:07.538 --> 27:09.105
tell me more about my mom.

27:09.149 --> 27:11.281
- Well, this is where
Jolene grew up.

27:13.370 --> 27:14.937
Wish I could tell ya' more.

27:14.981 --> 27:17.592
Tried looking for her.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.725
Wherever she went
after you were born...

27:19.768 --> 27:21.204
She doesn't want to be found.

27:21.770 --> 27:23.119
- How did you know her?

27:24.033 --> 27:25.121
- I'm your uncle.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.910
Jo didn't have family
growing up.

27:30.953 --> 27:32.389
My parents took her in.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.347
Raised her.

27:34.174 --> 27:35.654
- So, you're not really
my uncle?

27:35.697 --> 27:38.091
- Well, it's not really the way
it works up here, Bodie.

27:38.831 --> 27:41.660
It's more about community.
More than just blood.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.227
Maybe you didn't grow up here,

27:44.271 --> 27:46.752
but you're Anishinaabe.
You belong.

27:47.448 --> 27:48.579
And you're always welcome.

27:51.017 --> 27:52.714
- What's all that?
- Building a hockey rink

27:52.758 --> 27:54.542
for the kids. You play?

27:55.325 --> 27:58.764
- Baseball.
Um, but I can swing a hammer.

28:00.417 --> 28:01.418
- Let's go, then.

28:03.812 --> 28:06.510
Ah, crap. A bunch
of this wood is rotten.

28:08.599 --> 28:10.819
Those assholes in Winnipeg
screwed us.

28:11.472 --> 28:14.083
They sent us cheap wood because
they know we can't send it back.

28:15.781 --> 28:16.869
[sighs]

28:16.912 --> 28:18.653
- We have enough to finish
the rink?

28:18.697 --> 28:20.481
- No, wood's expensive,
hard to get up here.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.051
You know what? Jo, she...

28:26.139 --> 28:27.488
hated skating.

28:27.531 --> 28:28.445
She liked to sing.

28:30.056 --> 28:33.015
She loved to dance.
Especially at pow wows,

28:33.059 --> 28:34.625
to the drum.

28:34.669 --> 28:36.584
You know, that's why she went
to Toronto, to be a dancer.

28:36.627 --> 28:38.760
That's where she met your Dad.
- He was Jamaican.

28:39.152 --> 28:40.240
That's all I know about him.

28:41.632 --> 28:43.722
- Yeah, she never told me what
happened with him,

28:43.765 --> 28:45.158
but when she got pregnant,

28:45.201 --> 28:46.725
she was determined to keep you.

28:49.292 --> 28:50.511
Yeah, she loved you.

28:52.469 --> 28:53.775
Right from the start.

28:53.819 --> 28:56.822
But when Jo went into labour...

28:58.127 --> 29:01.087
A 17-year-old Anishinaabe girl,
far from home, alone,

29:01.130 --> 29:02.349
with no support...

29:07.093 --> 29:11.488
The social worker
made her give you up.

29:11.532 --> 29:13.490
[sombre music]

29:14.840 --> 29:17.538
- She chose to give me up.

29:17.843 --> 29:21.716
- No. The social worker
pressured her.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.978
Broke her down.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.459
You know, they're always
looking for ways to take

29:25.502 --> 29:27.200
our children away from us.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.637
- Nah, look man,
you're full of shit.

29:29.985 --> 29:31.247
- No, Bodie. Bodie.

29:34.163 --> 29:34.990
[sighs]

29:44.043 --> 29:47.568
- Celebratory wine and donuts
for your awesome interview.

29:48.830 --> 29:51.137
Hey, you okay?

29:53.139 --> 29:56.533
- No. Sorry. I...

29:57.621 --> 30:00.363
You're... You're amazing.

30:00.407 --> 30:01.974
[chuckles]
Trevor, you're...

30:02.017 --> 30:05.629
You're smart, funny and sweet.

30:05.673 --> 30:09.808
And... no one has ever
believed in me

30:09.851 --> 30:12.419
as much as I believe in myself.

30:13.376 --> 30:14.856
Except my Kookum.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.425
Uh, I, uh...

30:20.557 --> 30:25.214
Something changed yesterday
and I think that--

30:25.258 --> 30:26.781
- Jeremy?

30:30.263 --> 30:31.568
[sighs]

30:32.569 --> 30:33.483
Wow.

30:36.617 --> 30:38.271
I thought things
between us were--

30:38.314 --> 30:39.663
- They were.

30:39.707 --> 30:41.578
You push me,
you see my potential--

30:41.622 --> 30:42.841
- You don't want that?

30:42.884 --> 30:43.754
- I do.

30:44.538 --> 30:45.931
[chuckles]
I do.

30:49.238 --> 30:50.109
You...

30:51.588 --> 30:54.156
You want me to go to med school
so I can leave here.

30:55.766 --> 30:58.030
And I wanna go
so I can come back.

31:01.207 --> 31:03.644
North House...
North House is my heart.

31:06.821 --> 31:07.866
- And Jeremy?

31:11.695 --> 31:12.871
- He is too.

31:16.222 --> 31:17.092
I'm sorry.

31:18.006 --> 31:20.966
[soft music]

31:33.152 --> 31:34.196
[sighs]

31:47.079 --> 31:48.210
Maskwa?!

31:50.125 --> 31:51.257
Oh, God, Maskwa.

31:54.564 --> 31:55.826
- What happened?

31:55.870 --> 31:57.437
- You brought this shit
into the community?

31:58.612 --> 31:59.918
- No, uh, is he gonna be okay?

32:00.396 --> 32:02.050
Move him.
- You son of a bitch.

32:02.877 --> 32:03.704
You lied to me.

32:04.487 --> 32:06.054
[dramatic music]

32:11.494 --> 32:12.452
[grunts]

32:13.148 --> 32:15.020
Opioid overdose,
agonal breathing,

32:15.063 --> 32:16.282
pupils are pinpoint.

32:16.325 --> 32:17.979
- I was just chopping wood,

32:18.023 --> 32:19.415
I didn't even know
he was in there.

32:26.901 --> 32:27.902
[gasps]

32:28.859 --> 32:29.860
Oh my God.

32:30.339 --> 32:31.688
I'm so sorry, buddy.

32:31.732 --> 32:33.038
- Do you remember what happened?

32:33.081 --> 32:34.430
What did you take?

32:34.474 --> 32:37.564
- My arm started to hurt.
I knew you had ibuprofen.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.394
I found it in the black
and yellow box.

32:43.396 --> 32:44.397
- How many did you take?

32:44.963 --> 32:45.789
- Two.

32:47.139 --> 32:48.618
- Just two?

32:48.662 --> 32:50.620
Must be laced with fentanyl.
- Fentanyl?

32:52.013 --> 32:53.232
Those bastards.

32:54.363 --> 32:55.756
- Radio dispatch,
he needs a medevac ASAP,

32:55.799 --> 32:57.018
and try to find his parents.

32:57.062 --> 32:58.063
- Okay.

32:59.499 --> 33:00.500
- Is he going to be okay?
He's gonna be okay, right?

33:01.457 --> 33:02.850
- I asked you.

33:04.460 --> 33:08.029
I asked if you were selling Oxy
and you told me to my face

33:08.073 --> 33:09.509
that you weren't--

33:09.552 --> 33:11.467
- I would never sell it here--
- But you brought it!

33:11.511 --> 33:13.556
- I didn't! I didn't.
I didn't, okay?

33:15.210 --> 33:16.690
Some bikers in Winnipeg,
they found out

33:16.733 --> 33:18.257
about my pipeline, okay?

33:18.300 --> 33:19.867
That day I got stabbed,
they wanted me

33:19.910 --> 33:21.173
to sell their shit,
and I said no.

33:21.216 --> 33:23.697
They started sending it
anyway and...

33:23.740 --> 33:26.047
But I wouldn't sell it.
Okay? I wouldn't sell it.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.440
That's why Brad hit me
with his car,

33:27.483 --> 33:29.050
because I was sitting on it
instead of selling it.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.878
- And what? You expect me
to be glad?

33:30.921 --> 33:32.401
That you weren't making money?

33:32.445 --> 33:34.447
You were just bringing it here
where a kid could find it?

33:36.101 --> 33:37.145
- That's not fair.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.715
- Do you know how bad this
could have turned out?

33:43.021 --> 33:44.587
How bad it usually turns out?

33:44.631 --> 33:47.155
It's a miracle Emma
even had a kit.

33:48.461 --> 33:52.160
So many of our people die
because they can't get naloxone.

33:52.204 --> 33:54.075
- Crys--
- No, fentanyl

33:54.119 --> 33:56.643
is devastating our communities.

33:56.686 --> 34:00.342
And we worked hard to stop
this crap from coming up here.

34:00.386 --> 34:02.257
To prevent things like this
from happening--

34:02.301 --> 34:03.911
- Well, I could go
to the hospital, okay?

34:03.954 --> 34:05.434
I can help.
- No, no.

34:05.478 --> 34:06.870
No. You've done enough.

34:11.658 --> 34:14.748
[dramatic music]

35:03.188 --> 35:05.712
- We'll monitor his condition,
keep him under observation

35:05.755 --> 35:07.192
to make sure his symptoms
don't return.

35:07.975 --> 35:09.368
- That can happen sometimes
with naloxone.

35:09.411 --> 35:10.978
But he's in good hands.

35:11.021 --> 35:13.459
- Um, your son should make
a full recovery.

35:14.373 --> 35:16.288
- I'm looking for Maskwa Thomas.

35:18.594 --> 35:20.640
- Family social services.
- Why are they here?

35:20.683 --> 35:23.382
- Any overdose involving a minor
requires an official review

35:23.425 --> 35:25.906
to ensure the child's safety
at home.

35:25.949 --> 35:27.342
- It was an accident.

35:28.952 --> 35:32.391
- Any overdose involving a minor
requires an official review.

35:32.434 --> 35:34.175
[scoffs]
Maskwa will be removed

35:34.219 --> 35:36.264
to foster care until we complete
our review.

35:39.876 --> 35:41.269
- Did you know I was taken?

35:42.531 --> 35:43.445
- What?

35:44.185 --> 35:45.491
- My birth mother, Jolene.

35:45.534 --> 35:47.580
Did you know that
she wanted to keep me?

35:48.972 --> 35:52.019
- It wasn't like that, Austen.
It was a private adoption,

35:52.062 --> 35:53.063
she made a choice.

35:53.107 --> 35:54.500
- She didn't have a choice!

35:54.543 --> 35:56.241
The social worker pressured her,

35:56.284 --> 35:57.938
told her that she had
to give me away!

36:00.158 --> 36:01.942
Did you know?

36:06.729 --> 36:11.256
- Austen, we always assumed that
the adoption was consensual.

36:12.561 --> 36:15.260
But we wanted a child so badly.

36:15.303 --> 36:17.131
We didn't ask many questions.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.134
We should have asked more.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.876
[sombre music]

36:22.919 --> 36:24.443
Austen, sweet...
[beep!]

36:33.191 --> 36:34.148
[sighing]

36:46.726 --> 36:48.075
- Hey. How's Maskwa?

36:48.118 --> 36:49.207
- Okay.

36:57.302 --> 36:58.955
FSS is investigating.

37:00.609 --> 37:02.176
- Shit, Crys.

37:03.308 --> 37:04.483
I'm sorry.

37:06.659 --> 37:07.747
- Jeremy and I...

37:10.358 --> 37:11.403
We were...

37:15.015 --> 37:16.016
God...

37:17.104 --> 37:18.801
You must think I'm an idiot.

37:20.412 --> 37:22.327
Falling for his bullshit again.

37:23.937 --> 37:25.243
- I don't think that at all.

37:26.896 --> 37:29.072
- You know what, I should have
let you report him to the police

37:29.116 --> 37:30.465
after he got stabbed.

37:33.381 --> 37:34.904
- You couldn't have known
this would happen.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.430
No one could have.
- But it did.

37:39.866 --> 37:41.259
It did.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.394
[phone ringing]

37:47.221 --> 37:48.570
Trevor's calling.

37:52.357 --> 37:53.880
Maskwa?

37:53.923 --> 37:56.186
- I pulled some strings
with the contact at FSS.

37:56.230 --> 37:57.753
He won't be taken
from the community.

37:58.363 --> 37:59.233
[sighs]

38:02.758 --> 38:03.672
- Thank you.

38:04.891 --> 38:06.588
- It was the right thing to do.

38:07.415 --> 38:08.764
For Maskwa.

38:12.202 --> 38:13.987
- Trevor. I, um...

38:14.030 --> 38:15.031
- Goodbye, Crystal.

38:19.819 --> 38:22.604
[sombre music]

38:35.965 --> 38:38.577
[indistinct chatter]

38:43.669 --> 38:46.976
- What's all this?

38:47.020 --> 38:48.195
- I can get some more.

38:49.892 --> 38:51.677
- How'd ya' do it?
- Bought it.

38:52.765 --> 38:54.201
Rich adoptive parents.

38:54.854 --> 38:56.682
Gotta be good for something,
right?

38:58.988 --> 38:59.989
- You did good, Bodie.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.818
- I just wanted them
to be able to play.

39:03.123 --> 39:03.993
You know.

39:06.431 --> 39:07.954
- Let's get to work, then.

39:11.131 --> 39:12.001
Let's go.

39:12.393 --> 39:13.568
Come on. Light it up here.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.618
- Morning, sunshine.
How ya' feeling?

39:19.661 --> 39:21.184
- Like a whole new man.

39:25.145 --> 39:28.409
- Did you call and make an
appointment with that counselor?

39:28.453 --> 39:30.672
- Next week, boss. Hm.

39:31.804 --> 39:34.110
- I'm proud of you.

39:34.154 --> 39:36.417
- Hey. Thank you...

39:37.636 --> 39:38.767
for having my back.

39:41.248 --> 39:42.205
- Daj mi buzi?

39:42.249 --> 39:43.119
[chuckles]

39:50.518 --> 39:52.302
Alright. I gotta go.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.219

39:57.482 --> 39:58.961
[door shuts]

40:03.270 --> 40:05.881
[pensive music]

40:21.984 --> 40:23.029
- Ready for number six?

40:27.642 --> 40:29.688
- Uh, Em.

40:32.517 --> 40:35.345
This isn't working for me.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.478
- Okay. We could just skip
to number eight.

40:39.175 --> 40:41.177
- My ex didn't want
me to be a pilot.

40:43.136 --> 40:47.096
She wanted me to give up flying.

40:49.882 --> 40:50.883
- That's not cool.

40:50.926 --> 40:52.232
- Yeah, but I did it.

40:53.581 --> 40:54.539
For her.

40:55.540 --> 40:58.281
And she left anyway.

41:01.371 --> 41:04.287
I was trying so hard

41:04.331 --> 41:05.811
to make someone else happy...

41:08.335 --> 41:10.598
even though I was miserable.

41:12.295 --> 41:14.515
Look, I really, really like you.

41:14.559 --> 41:16.212
But I can't do that again.

41:18.954 --> 41:20.478
- I like you too.

41:21.435 --> 41:25.439
But after Devon, you really
can't ask me for more right now.

41:27.093 --> 41:28.790
- I know.

41:42.021 --> 41:42.978
[door closing]

41:45.328 --> 41:48.331
[pensive music]

41:54.599 --> 41:56.296
- There it is.
[chuckles]

41:56.339 --> 42:00.082
Cassiopeia was more beautiful
than all of nereids.

42:00.126 --> 42:02.476
So, Poseidon got mad
and chained her daughter

42:02.520 --> 42:03.651
to a rock under the sea.

42:05.348 --> 42:06.306
It was a thing.

42:07.655 --> 42:09.352
But she's pretty bright
this time of the year.

42:12.268 --> 42:14.096
- How come you never brought me
out here before?

42:15.489 --> 42:16.882
- Seemed like
you needed it tonight.

42:18.797 --> 42:20.102
- I needed it tonight.

42:23.628 --> 42:24.498
Emma?

42:25.717 --> 42:28.328
- You were right.
It's not what I wanted.

42:30.460 --> 42:31.679
Do you know what you do want?

42:34.073 --> 42:35.857
- Same thing I've wanted
since I was ten.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.034
To be an astronaut.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.037
About as likely
as me and Emma, huh?

42:44.649 --> 42:47.565
- You're an amazing pilot,
Chops. And an engineer.

42:48.130 --> 42:49.784
Aren't those pretty much
the requirements?

42:52.047 --> 42:54.484
[soft music]

42:56.051 --> 42:57.879
[phone ringing]

42:57.923 --> 43:01.491
[dramatic music]

43:03.842 --> 43:04.973
- Hello?

43:05.017 --> 43:06.148
- Hayley Roberts?

43:07.628 --> 43:08.890
- Yes.

43:08.934 --> 43:10.892
- It's Dr. Allen's
office calling,

43:10.936 --> 43:12.285
we have your MRI results.

43:15.897 --> 43:18.726
Subtitling: difuze
