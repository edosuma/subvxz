00:03.264 --> 00:06.919
Chen Yu-Lan,
meet your future patron.

00:07.094 --> 00:09.792
What the hell is this?
This is nuts.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.576
Come here.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.974
This isn't about
microchips anymore.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.280
This is kidnapping.

00:19.454 --> 00:21.151
In what stretch
of reality

00:21.325 --> 00:22.674
would kidnapping become
part of the plan?

00:22.848 --> 00:25.286
The plan failed,
so I came up
with a better plan.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.114
SCG segregates
each department

00:27.288 --> 00:28.811
so no one person
knows the secret

00:28.985 --> 00:30.117
of how to make
its precious chip.

00:30.291 --> 00:31.727
No one except
dear Mr. Chen.

00:31.901 --> 00:34.425
Please help us.
Please, sir, please.

00:34.599 --> 00:36.514
Oh, my God.
- This is just insanity.
- Not at all.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.168
SCG makes
a critical supply

00:38.342 --> 00:40.257
of the world's
most advanced microchip.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.780
We don't want
to corner the market.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.347
Many of the cars your
employers make aren't running

00:43.521 --> 00:45.697
because they can't acquire
enough chips to make them run.

00:45.871 --> 00:48.091
I'm offering them
an endless supply.

00:48.265 --> 00:49.832
You know what?

00:50.006 --> 00:51.616
We don't want anything
to do with this.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.401
Good.
A state actor, then?

00:53.575 --> 00:57.492
A superpower with the vision
that you clearly lack.

00:57.666 --> 01:00.799
And what about Mr. Chen
and his family?

01:00.973 --> 01:02.323
Well, they're no longer
your concern.

01:04.325 --> 01:06.675
No!

01:06.849 --> 01:08.851
I think we know the moral
to that story.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.464
Do as I say

01:13.638 --> 01:16.206
so I won't have to do
as I do.

01:19.079 --> 01:19.992
Understood?

01:22.821 --> 01:24.345
Yes, no?

01:31.265 --> 01:34.006
Plan "B."

01:34.181 --> 01:35.312
You're gonna die
when you hear it.

01:46.584 --> 01:47.977
It's the only way
this works.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.109
Then it's not gonna work.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.762
- I can't go in.
- Why?

01:50.936 --> 01:51.981
'Cause you're
still wounded?

01:52.155 --> 01:53.113
Because we don't have
a warrant yet.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.418
I can't enter without one.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.420
Oh, but, so, you can't,
but I can?

01:56.594 --> 01:59.989
I'm an FBI agent.
You're not.

02:00.163 --> 02:01.860
Look, Anderson abducted
a family,

02:02.034 --> 02:03.862
a husband, a wife,
an 11-year-old daughter.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.734
We have probable cause
to enter his home.

02:05.908 --> 02:08.606
And I will, as soon
as Park gets the warrant.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.131
Otherwise, anything I find
that proves his guilt

02:11.305 --> 02:12.393
will get tossed
out of court.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.569
Hey, I know
the rules of evidence.

02:14.743 --> 02:17.093
But I'm not just gonna
- sit there waiting.
- Then don't.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.703
We're legally
on thin ice anyway.

02:18.877 --> 02:21.097
You're arguably acting
as an agent of the Bureau.

02:21.271 --> 02:24.013
So, you're the Good Cop
and I'm the Bad Guy now?

02:25.841 --> 02:28.148
Oh, this
just gets better and better.

02:45.077 --> 02:48.168
You said the place
was upscale,
but not lived in.

02:48.342 --> 02:49.604
Raymond has places
like that.

02:49.778 --> 02:50.735
Why?

02:52.041 --> 02:53.260
Because he can.

02:53.434 --> 02:54.826
Because he has resources,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.742
which means
The Skinner does, too.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.657
Resources we can't match.

03:02.094 --> 03:03.705
So, why'd you become
an agent?

03:03.879 --> 03:05.707
I mean, Reddington always has
some secret agenda.

03:05.881 --> 03:07.099
What's yours?

03:09.319 --> 03:13.280
What you found is that
we're outmatched,

03:13.454 --> 03:15.456
that unless we get help,
we'll never find
the hostages

03:15.630 --> 03:17.240
or avenge the death
of my partner,

03:17.414 --> 03:18.459
not that you care much.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.158
Third degree burns,

03:22.332 --> 03:24.073
and the biggest pain
I've got is you.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.301
Yeah, it's me.

03:34.475 --> 03:35.867
I think you need to reach out
to the senator.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.354
Cynthia.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.878
That's "Senator Cynthia"
to you.

03:47.052 --> 03:48.793
To what do I owe
the displeasure?

03:48.967 --> 03:50.752
And I thought absence
made the heart grow fonder.

03:50.926 --> 03:52.580
I am found of you
when you're absent.

03:52.754 --> 03:56.366
Up close, I vacillate
between fear and loathing.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.107
Your briefing with
the Secretary has to wait.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.500
Aren't you
a talking head now?

03:59.674 --> 04:01.850
Chitchatting about crime
and terrorism

04:02.024 --> 04:03.547
till you're booted
for the segment

04:03.721 --> 04:05.767
on how to make
the perfect hot wing?

04:05.941 --> 04:07.464
This is important,
Senator.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.553
I'm sure it is, Harold.

04:09.727 --> 04:12.164
That's what I'm afraid of.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.862
I'm sure you know about
the attempted theft

04:14.036 --> 04:15.559
of the SCG microchips.

04:15.733 --> 04:17.909
What you may not know
is that Dembe Zuma

04:18.083 --> 04:19.041
is the reason
they weren't taken.

04:19.215 --> 04:20.564
I heard he was
with the Bureau.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.000
I can only imagine
what heartstring

04:22.174 --> 04:23.611
you had to pull
to make that happen.

04:23.785 --> 04:26.614
He's been badly hurt,
his partner killed.

04:26.788 --> 04:27.963
For his troubles,
he's been benched

04:28.137 --> 04:29.051
pending an investigation.

04:29.225 --> 04:30.835
So, he turned to you.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.359
And I got the band
back together.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.752
What band?
There is no band.

04:34.926 --> 04:36.058
I disbanded the band.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.408
Voided Reddington's
immunity agreement.

04:38.582 --> 04:40.976
- He's given us a lead.
- A lead on what?

04:41.150 --> 04:43.805
The microchips
weren't taken,
but the engineer,

04:43.979 --> 04:46.851
Chen Yu-Lan, who knows
how to make them, was.

04:47.025 --> 04:49.245
Imagine that information
in the hands of our enemies.

04:49.419 --> 04:52.379
Technology that powers
your phone, your car,

04:52.553 --> 04:54.163
the Internet.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.034
And once they have it,
imagine them

04:56.208 --> 04:57.601
cutting us off
from getting it.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.037
I haven't heard about
any abduction.

04:59.211 --> 05:01.170
Is anyone claiming
responsibility?

05:01.344 --> 05:04.565
Yes, a 700-year-old pirate.

05:04.739 --> 05:07.524
Does Reddington know any
run-of-the-mill criminals?

05:07.698 --> 05:10.919
The Skinner is the latest
in a long line of brigands,

05:11.093 --> 05:13.791
a nom de guerre passed
from one generation
to the next.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.576
The current Skinner
is Graeme Anderson.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.535
He abducted the engineer
and his family.

05:18.709 --> 05:21.277
We can't solve this case
without your help.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.372
If, hypothetically speaking,

05:29.546 --> 05:32.549
I was to help,

05:32.723 --> 05:33.985
what would you need?

05:50.132 --> 05:52.917
Panabaker sliced us
a small piece
of black ops funding

05:53.091 --> 05:55.006
and a promise for tactical
assistance if needed.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.922
What about
access to CODIS
and Bureau databases?

05:58.096 --> 06:00.229
They're ours as soon
as you and Agent Park
access the system.

06:06.975 --> 06:07.671
Agent Park.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.501
We're on a clock.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.111
Right. Sorry.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.600
What are you doing?

06:23.774 --> 06:25.254
Perseverating.

06:27.038 --> 06:29.432
About what you said.

06:29.606 --> 06:32.130
About honoring Elizabeth.

06:32.304 --> 06:35.612
I mean, what are you doing
here in her office?

06:35.786 --> 06:38.702
I believe I already answered
that question, Donald.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.185
You're back.

06:43.359 --> 06:44.926
For the moment.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.493
Let me bring you
up to speed.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.538
How about we do that
in your office?

07:00.028 --> 07:01.986
Just go slowly.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.858
It'll come.

07:04.032 --> 07:05.512
What'll come?

07:05.686 --> 07:07.209
I don't know.

07:07.383 --> 07:10.299
Whatever it is.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.083
Tomorrow, I suppose.

07:24.139 --> 07:25.923
This is just
a satellite office.

07:26.097 --> 07:27.969
Please.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.232
- Your plan will not work.
It has to work.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.321
I have bidders lined up
for the processing software

07:32.495 --> 07:34.541
and the man
who can run it.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.717
You're the man,
and now you're gonna
get me that software.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.459
The program you want
is only kept in Taiwan.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.069
I'm not an idiot,
Mr. Chen.

07:41.243 --> 07:42.766
There's computers
in that building

07:42.940 --> 07:44.420
that can access
the SCG mainframe in Taipei.

07:44.594 --> 07:45.726
Am I wrong?

07:45.900 --> 07:46.901
There are
security protocols.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.990
Well, you're the CTO.

07:49.164 --> 07:51.688
If anyone can bypass them,
I'm betting you can.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.995
And when I do,

07:54.169 --> 07:56.998
you will
let my family go?

07:57.172 --> 07:58.913
Whatever happens to them
is entirely in your hands.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.436
You have until 5:00.

08:02.090 --> 08:03.526
Oh, and, Mr. Chen,

08:03.700 --> 08:05.006
I have someone
on the inside.

08:05.180 --> 08:08.052
Everything you say or do,
I'll know.

08:16.713 --> 08:17.888
You hungry?

08:18.062 --> 08:20.021
I want a omelet
from Tempo.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.502
The fluffy kind
that makes you feel like
you're eating a cloud.

08:22.676 --> 08:23.807
Or we could rob
a convenience store,

08:23.981 --> 08:25.330
or take candy from a baby.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.158
Something to pass
the time, hmm?

08:30.031 --> 08:31.162
Chen's got a nice family.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.339
I hope he gets
what I need.

08:39.997 --> 08:43.131
We know The Skinner
abducted Chen and his family.

08:43.305 --> 08:45.525
We don't know if anyone
hired him to do it.

08:45.699 --> 08:46.743
There's nothing
from State or Langley

08:46.917 --> 08:48.353
to suggest The Skinner
is working

08:48.528 --> 08:52.096
for Russia, China,
or North, um...

08:52.270 --> 08:54.621
I'm, I'm sorry, but, uh,
what happened to your hair?

08:54.795 --> 08:56.361
Oh.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.189
Straight razor.

08:58.363 --> 09:01.845
Weecha does my face
and my head in one fell swoop.

09:02.019 --> 09:04.674
We don't have enough
electricity where we live

09:04.848 --> 09:08.635
to waste any on clippers
or other electronics.

09:08.809 --> 09:11.594
Just the fridge
and the CD player.

09:11.768 --> 09:13.291
But I can tell you,

09:13.465 --> 09:15.337
one of life's
great simple pleasures

09:15.511 --> 09:17.644
is seeing a woman, naked,
out on the porch,

09:17.818 --> 09:19.254
with a bowl of hot water

09:19.428 --> 09:21.430
shaving her legs
with a straight razor.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.127
It's captivating.

09:23.301 --> 09:25.565
Bastards took my Scotch.

09:25.739 --> 09:26.653
I've been drinking
a lot of rum.

09:26.827 --> 09:29.090
Slow-aged in the mountains.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.092
Rich and delicious.

09:31.266 --> 09:32.789
We get barrels of the stuff

09:32.963 --> 09:35.357
from Weecha
and Mierce's family.

09:35.531 --> 09:37.098
Cool. Uh, there's nothing
in the Bureau's database

09:37.272 --> 09:38.969
about Chen's disappearance,

09:39.143 --> 09:41.015
and SCG hasn't
reported him missing.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.451
That's all we have.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.279
I know not to ask you
how you can help us,

09:44.453 --> 09:46.368
but I know you can,
and I hope

09:46.542 --> 09:48.152
your being here
means you will.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.333
Donald paid me
a visit recently.

09:55.507 --> 09:59.642
He reminded me that
Elizabeth only agreed

09:59.816 --> 10:02.602
to take over my affairs
because she...

10:04.952 --> 10:07.563
...felt duty-bound
to continue the Blacklist.

10:13.134 --> 10:16.616
That's why she was there
that night.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.447
Doing her duty.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.586
I'm not here
just to help you, Harold.

10:30.760 --> 10:34.634
I'm here because
it's what she would want.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.424
I'll bring you a case
of that rum.

10:44.339 --> 10:47.516
It's a swift kick to the head,
and no headache.

10:53.391 --> 10:56.307
If you ever want to talk about
what he likes or dislikes...

10:56.481 --> 10:57.657
I know what he likes
and dislikes.

11:01.443 --> 11:04.228
Dembe, I'm glad
you're feeling better.

11:04.402 --> 11:07.449
Agent Park, congratulations
on your marriage.

11:07.623 --> 11:09.843
Not so much on your
recent freelance work.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.455
How do you know
- about that?
- I pay attention.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.892
Or pay people
to pay attention for me.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.589
Nasty bit of business.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.288
But your Peter seems like
a ray of sunshine.

11:27.251 --> 11:29.863
I found Chen.
He's here in DC, at work.

11:30.037 --> 11:32.387
The company has
a satellite office
across the river.

11:32.561 --> 11:33.649
Chen showed up
for his meetings
this morning

11:33.823 --> 11:35.216
like nothing ever happened.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.218
Aram, Agent Park,
get to that office.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.350
If Chen's okay,
then maybe his family is, too.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.526
If they're not,
then he's pretending.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.919
I want to know why.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.049
You said
you'd take care of it.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.485
I told you
where to find him.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.661
I teed him up,
and you shanked it.

13:14.619 --> 13:17.797
Now you've come to my club
and put me off my game.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.320
I was once
struck by lightning

13:19.494 --> 13:21.539
on a golf course

13:21.713 --> 13:23.715
while playing in Tripoli.

13:23.890 --> 13:27.545
Gaddafi was dead,
and to honor
the small part I played

13:27.719 --> 13:30.418
in his unceremonious demise,

13:30.592 --> 13:34.378
the leader of the NTC
invited me to play a round

13:34.552 --> 13:37.294
on the dictator's
private course.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.775
One minute, I'm standing
on the 12th green,

13:39.949 --> 13:42.212
the next, I'm in
a desert encampment

13:42.386 --> 13:45.128
with a lovely raven-haired
freedom fighter

13:45.302 --> 13:47.957
who's administering
to my burns

13:48.131 --> 13:50.699
with the touch
of a lover's stroke.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.179
I'm not calling him.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.572
This Skinner
is your successor.

13:54.746 --> 13:56.792
You hand-picked him

13:56.966 --> 13:58.838
to take over
when you retired.

13:59.012 --> 14:01.014
Now he's killed
an FBI agent,

14:01.188 --> 14:02.972
abducted the CTO

14:03.146 --> 14:06.454
of the world's largest
microchip manufacturer,

14:06.628 --> 14:09.936
and he's threatening to create
an international incident

14:10.110 --> 14:14.592
that will ruin
your historic reputation.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.377
Why do you care
about our reputation?

14:16.551 --> 14:19.206
Anderson is
the 22nd Skinner,

14:19.380 --> 14:22.165
twenty-two generations
of torch-passing.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.776
I couldn't do it once.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.735
I admire what you all
have built.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.389
I don't want
to see it ruined.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.652
I'm retired, not senile.

14:30.826 --> 14:33.176
What aren't you telling me?

14:33.350 --> 14:35.396
I'll tell you after
you talk him off the ledge.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.702
I'm the president
of my condo association.

14:37.877 --> 14:38.965
Garbage pick-up.

14:39.139 --> 14:41.010
Grounds management.

14:41.184 --> 14:42.664
That's what I do now,
argue about yard signs

14:42.838 --> 14:44.840
with snowbirds,

14:45.014 --> 14:47.060
not try and talk sense
to a lunatic.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.497
The charter, then.

14:49.671 --> 14:51.760
I know you have the power
to invoke it.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.414
Even if I wanted to,
and I'm not saying I do,

14:53.588 --> 14:55.285
because I don't,

14:55.459 --> 14:57.157
I couldn't do it
without my predecessor.

14:57.331 --> 14:58.810
The Captain.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.682
Is it true
that she had affairs

15:00.856 --> 15:02.553
during the Paris Peace Talks

15:02.727 --> 15:05.034
with both Kissinger
and Le Duc Tho?

15:05.208 --> 15:07.210
The charter's
never been invoked.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.038
Not once in 700 years.

15:10.561 --> 15:13.608
Then it'll be
a bolt out of the blue.

15:13.782 --> 15:16.480
I lived to tell about
my rather gentle
lightning strike.

15:16.654 --> 15:19.570
If we do this right,
Anderson won't be so lucky.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.000
What am I missing?

15:58.174 --> 15:59.436
Why would The Skinner
abduct Chen

15:59.610 --> 16:01.221
only to release him
a day later?

16:01.395 --> 16:03.745
Maybe he escaped,
but if he did,

16:03.919 --> 16:05.790
why go to work
and not the police?

16:07.836 --> 16:09.533
Check it out.
That's him.

16:13.450 --> 16:14.930
Shoot.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.388
You're not here.
We're not doing this.

16:38.562 --> 16:39.911
Uh, but, uh, we are.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.739
I'm pretty sure
Pete deserves to know.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.742
- Hi, sweetie.
<i>Hey.</i>

16:44.916 --> 16:45.874
<i>Any chance
we could have lunch?</i>

16:46.048 --> 16:47.745
-<i>Talk things over?
- I wish.</i>

16:47.919 --> 16:49.486
But I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

16:49.660 --> 16:50.618
<i>The case.</i>

16:50.792 --> 16:52.054
Pete, I'm not
a field agent.

16:52.228 --> 16:53.012
I'm doing a friend
a favor.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.230
One. <i>One?</i>

16:54.404 --> 16:56.450
One, and not a risky one.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.541
I promise.
A walk in the park.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.238
But we'll talk about it
tonight, okay?

17:02.412 --> 17:03.283
I have to go. <i>Okay.</i>

17:03.457 --> 17:04.893
<i>Be safe.</i>

17:06.677 --> 17:08.201
Um, okay, uh, the street,
it's down there.

17:10.507 --> 17:11.682
Oh, Alina! Car!

17:11.856 --> 17:13.597
Car! Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Oh!

17:16.731 --> 17:18.080
Okay.

17:37.447 --> 17:39.667
Oh,
okay. Phew!

17:39.841 --> 17:40.320
I'm driving next time.

17:40.494 --> 17:41.625
- Seriously.
- Ah.

17:42.713 --> 17:43.758
FBI!

17:43.932 --> 17:45.455
Hands on the wheel, now.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.504
Just a walk in the park.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.948
You don't know the address,
but can you describe
the building?

18:00.122 --> 18:02.081
What part
of the city it... I was blindfolded.

18:02.255 --> 18:04.387
In and out.
All I have is a number.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.607
To a burner phone,
which is untraceable.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.696
Which is why
you have to let me go,

18:08.870 --> 18:10.959
so I can call
and free my family.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.482
That's it, then,
you give him this,

18:12.656 --> 18:13.918
and he lets you
and your family go.

18:15.790 --> 18:16.878
My family, yes.

18:18.793 --> 18:19.663
Your family,
but not you.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.320
That's it, isn't it?

18:26.496 --> 18:27.976
You're trading your life
for theirs.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.021
I don't care
what happens to me.

18:30.196 --> 18:33.112
My wife and my daughter...

18:33.286 --> 18:34.939
They're all that matter.

18:36.550 --> 18:37.986
Good to see you,
Mr. Beauregard.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.640
- It's been a while.
- Good to see you,
too, Ernesto.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.076
I've been in California,

18:41.250 --> 18:42.773
on trial
in the Central District.

18:42.947 --> 18:44.166
Quite the drama.

18:44.340 --> 18:45.602
Yeah, well,
this client of yours

18:45.776 --> 18:47.300
is no stranger
to drama, either.

18:47.474 --> 18:48.910
- Alberta?
- She's been in
a state all morning.

18:49.084 --> 18:51.217
Well, what's the trouble?

18:51.391 --> 18:52.870
I'll tell you
the trouble.

18:53.044 --> 18:55.438
One of these bastards
stole my phone!

18:55.612 --> 18:57.353
- Your cellphone?
- Yeah, that's right.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.529
Look away.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.445
I am not crazy.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.360
I had it right here,
and now it's gone.

19:04.534 --> 19:05.579
Easy, dear.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.320
How do you feel?

19:07.494 --> 19:09.713
Like beating to death
anybody who asks me
how I feel.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.500
Who's this?

19:13.674 --> 19:15.676
Ms. Gilbert,
or Alberta.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.068
May I call you Alberta?

19:17.243 --> 19:18.113
Oh, thank goodness
I caught you.

19:18.287 --> 19:19.245
- Mr. Beauregard?
- Hmm?

19:19.419 --> 19:21.072
Margaret Collins.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.422
I'm the new Director
of Resident Relations.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.989
You look concerned, dear.
Not to worry.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.949
Nobody's having relations
with the residents.

19:28.123 --> 19:30.995
But if I could
just have a word
with you privately?

19:33.476 --> 19:34.956
I know you called ahead
to say you'd like

19:35.130 --> 19:36.305
to take Alberta out
for the afternoon.

19:36.479 --> 19:38.742
Same as always.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.309
Well, unfortunately,
things aren't quite
the same as always.

19:40.483 --> 19:43.225
I'm sorry to say,
Alberta's had
a small setback.

19:43.399 --> 19:45.227
- What kind of setback?
- We're not sure yet.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.838
I can't share
medical information,

19:48.012 --> 19:50.276
but as you're her attorney,
I feel comfortable saying

19:50.450 --> 19:52.234
her dementia appears
to be progressing.

19:52.408 --> 19:53.975
I'm afraid
her nephew Douglas

19:54.149 --> 19:56.064
has left strict instructions

19:56.238 --> 19:57.196
that Alberta is not
to leave the grounds

19:57.370 --> 19:58.806
under any circumstances.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.895
He's been trying
to reach a specialist

20:01.069 --> 20:02.766
about evaluating
her condition.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.159
If...
I'm sorry.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.247
I'm Walter Brenneman.

20:05.421 --> 20:06.509
Or Dr. Brenneman,

20:06.683 --> 20:07.902
but, please,
call me Walter.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.296
Oh, uh,
- you're a doctor?
- I am.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.254
I couldn't help
but overhear.

20:12.428 --> 20:14.256
In fact,
I'm the very specialist

20:14.430 --> 20:16.127
you were just referring to.

20:16.302 --> 20:19.087
Uh, Norm here and I
are old golfing buddies,

20:19.261 --> 20:20.697
and he asked if I'd come

20:20.871 --> 20:23.222
and spend some time
with Alberta.

20:23.396 --> 20:26.355
I'm a neuroscientist,
first and foremost.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.270
Normally, of course,
I wouldn't be available

20:28.444 --> 20:30.359
to take on new patients.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.927
My research
at Mayo is... The Mayo Clinic?

20:33.101 --> 20:34.320
- Yes.
- Wow, Wow.

20:34.494 --> 20:36.104
That is wonderful.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.411
So, you knew about
Alberta's setback?

20:38.585 --> 20:41.849
I did. Uh,
Douglas and I spoke.
He sounded distraught,

20:42.023 --> 20:43.764
so I promised
to pull a few strings.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.635
Let me get Doug
on the phone.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.289
Yeah, hi,
Norman Beauregard.

20:47.463 --> 20:48.812
Is he available?

20:48.986 --> 20:51.206
Oh, darn.
Yeah, I see.

20:51.380 --> 20:54.470
Well, have him call me
right away.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.298
He's in off-site meetings
all afternoon.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.387
Ouch.

20:58.561 --> 21:01.738
I mean, I could try
and come back another day.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.653
Oh, no, I'm in Brussels
next week for a conference.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.786
No, no, we appreciate you
taking the time.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.266
I'm sure it would be fine

21:07.440 --> 21:09.137
under Mr. Beauregard's
supervision.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.399
And since you spoke
with Douglas...

21:10.573 --> 21:11.574
Hmm. Yes?

21:11.748 --> 21:13.576
Wonderful.
Okeydoke.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.581
Where are we going?

21:18.755 --> 21:20.844
I want to invoke the charter
to remove Anderson.

21:21.018 --> 21:22.063
I can't do that
without you.

21:22.237 --> 21:23.586
What's wrong
with Anderson?

21:23.760 --> 21:25.501
He's noticeable.

21:25.675 --> 21:28.243
Your legacy survives
because it isn't.

21:28.417 --> 21:29.984
Who the hell is this guy?

21:30.158 --> 21:31.768
That's Raymond Reddington.

21:31.942 --> 21:32.856
No.

21:34.423 --> 21:35.859
You.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.165
Come closer.

21:39.123 --> 21:42.301
I'll be damned.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.041
Give me a kiss.

21:44.215 --> 21:47.131
- A good one.
- We're in a bit of a rush.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.133
You want my help,
it's the cost
of doing business.

21:51.962 --> 21:54.269
Open-mouth.

21:54.443 --> 21:56.097
We're parked
in a fire lane.

21:56.271 --> 21:59.318
No tongue, no invoking
the charter.

22:12.156 --> 22:13.897
Let's blow this
Popsicle stand.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.162
Microchips are like
coated wafers.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.601
The idea is to cram on
the microscopic
subatomic features

22:21.775 --> 22:23.733
that are the basis
of the chip's performance.

22:23.907 --> 22:27.084
Now, this software is a guide
for manipulating atoms

22:27.258 --> 22:30.479
one-tenth the size
of a human hair or less.

22:30.653 --> 22:31.828
And Chen knows
how to operate it.

22:32.002 --> 22:33.830
Meaning The Skinner has
two key ingredients

22:34.004 --> 22:34.962
for making the chips.

22:35.136 --> 22:36.355
SCG chips.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.705
The most advanced
in the world.

22:38.879 --> 22:40.794
So advanced that,

22:40.968 --> 22:43.144
and this is one of those
impossible but true factoids,

22:43.318 --> 22:46.495
no one in Silicon Valley
or Zhongguancun

22:46.669 --> 22:49.019
or anywhere else on Earth
knows how to make them.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.457
So, an already
vulnerable market

22:51.631 --> 22:54.547
susceptible to
catastrophic disruptions
in the supply chain

22:54.721 --> 22:57.506
can be controlled by whoever
has Chen and the software?

22:57.680 --> 22:59.595
Which, at the moment,
is us.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.118
We don't control anything.

23:01.292 --> 23:02.903
We don't,
but America could.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.687
Only if we got Chen
to cooperate

23:04.861 --> 23:05.862
and give the government
a hard drive

23:06.036 --> 23:07.081
that doesn't belong to us.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.256
We're talking
about technology

23:08.430 --> 23:09.605
that makes the world
go 'round.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.781
Which is why
we shouldn't steal it.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.957
When you and Reddington
took something,
it was stealing.

23:14.131 --> 23:16.699
When America does it,
it's manifest destiny.

23:16.873 --> 23:19.267
The only people whose destiny
I'm concerned with right now

23:19.441 --> 23:21.225
are Chen's wife
and daughter.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.489
Chen was supposed to call
The Skinner when he gets
the software.

23:23.663 --> 23:24.968
Then that's exactly
what he's going to do.

23:27.841 --> 23:30.496
I have it, the software.

23:30.670 --> 23:33.237
Do you? I wonder. <i>I can bring it to you.</i>

23:33.412 --> 23:35.544
I just need to talk
to my wife first.

23:35.718 --> 23:36.371
<i>I haven't heard
from my inside man.</i>

23:36.545 --> 23:37.807
<i>Why is that?</i>

23:37.981 --> 23:39.243
<i>I just need
to talk to Wei.</i>

23:45.075 --> 23:46.076
Yu-Lan.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.165
Wei!

23:54.868 --> 23:57.305
One hour.
2440 Junior Terrace.

24:02.179 --> 24:03.354
What do we do now?

24:05.356 --> 24:06.662
Get your family back.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.326
I'm not giving him
the program?

24:18.500 --> 24:20.546
- Not the real one, no.
- I have to give it to him!

24:20.720 --> 24:22.678
We can't risk the real one
falling into enemy hands.

24:22.852 --> 24:25.072
And I can't risk him
killing my family!

24:25.246 --> 24:26.552
Of course not,
which is why

24:26.726 --> 24:28.597
we've only made
a few modifications,

24:28.771 --> 24:31.731
imperceptible changes
in millions of lines of code.

24:31.905 --> 24:34.473
Only a handful of experts
in the entire world

24:34.647 --> 24:35.996
would have any clue that
it's not the genuine article.

24:36.170 --> 24:37.606
We know
what we're doing.

24:37.780 --> 24:40.087
I know it's hard,
but, please, trust us.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.356
Tell me again.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.837
The meeting point
is likely a pick-up.

24:51.011 --> 24:53.143
Wherever they take you,
we will track you with these.

24:53.317 --> 24:54.884
Totally undetectable.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.365
The listening components
are baked into the frame.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.019
We're gonna be with you
the entire time,

24:59.193 --> 25:01.587
and <i>when</i> he releases
your family,

25:01.761 --> 25:03.284
the SWAT team will hit
the building,

25:03.458 --> 25:07.462
save you,
and arrest the others.

25:07.636 --> 25:10.204
- We have the engineer.
- The one who knows how
to make the microchips

25:10.378 --> 25:12.336
as well as
the processing software

25:12.511 --> 25:13.642
he needs to make them?

25:13.816 --> 25:15.296
The proprietary
software, yes.

25:19.039 --> 25:21.607
Look around, Harold.

25:21.781 --> 25:23.783
What do you see?

25:23.957 --> 25:26.437
What you see
is me out on a limb

25:26.612 --> 25:28.788
calling in favors
to get you this office,

25:28.962 --> 25:31.834
to put this God-forsaken
task force back in business.

25:32.008 --> 25:34.881
What you see is a senator
you should thank

25:35.055 --> 25:36.926
while giving me the program
this country needs

25:37.100 --> 25:39.363
to make its own
high-end semiconducting chips

25:39.538 --> 25:40.582
without relying
on a foreign power.

25:40.756 --> 25:42.628
So we should steal it?

25:42.802 --> 25:44.064
How does that
make us any better
than Graeme Anderson?

25:44.238 --> 25:46.893
Anderson's a criminal
looking to turn a profit.

25:47.067 --> 25:49.635
We're patriots
with an obligation
to safeguard this nation.

25:51.419 --> 25:53.856
- Where is it now?
- I won't answer that.

25:54.030 --> 25:56.337
We're talking international
politics, Harold.

25:56.511 --> 25:58.948
Spycraft, war.

25:59.122 --> 26:01.168
It's more complicated
than right and wrong.

26:02.517 --> 26:04.345
Not to me, it isn't.

26:26.541 --> 26:29.196
Maybe I was wrong.

26:29.370 --> 26:30.676
For reaching out to you
in Detroit.

26:30.850 --> 26:33.853
Maybe it's too much
being here.

26:34.027 --> 26:35.594
If it is... But it's not.

26:37.508 --> 26:40.903
If it is,
we'd all understand.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.561
It's time to meet.

26:46.735 --> 26:47.736
All right, let's do it.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.869
Look, I'm good.

26:50.043 --> 26:51.000
Then roll out.

27:05.058 --> 27:06.320
Show me the drive.

27:27.384 --> 27:29.604
Hey, Aram,
- are you seeing this?
<i>All over it.</i>

27:29.778 --> 27:31.954
The building looks like
some kind of
shipping warehouse.

27:32.128 --> 27:34.435
Public records show
just over 58,000 square feet

27:34.609 --> 27:36.872
for the complex,
owned by a shell company

27:37.046 --> 27:39.005
<i>called Goldenshore Industries.</i>

27:39.179 --> 27:40.659
We can't cover
that kind of space

27:40.833 --> 27:42.008
- with just us.
<i>Way ahead of you.</i>

27:42.182 --> 27:44.488
SWAT units have been
dispatched to that location.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.273
Tell me you got it.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.061
I knew you could do it.

27:52.235 --> 27:53.410
Now that it's done,
I can tell you

27:53.584 --> 27:54.455
all these guys
bet against you but me.

27:54.629 --> 27:55.891
Total confidence.

27:56.065 --> 27:57.284
That's Anderson.

27:57.458 --> 27:58.764
We sit tight
until he releases

27:58.938 --> 28:00.809
Chen's wife and daughter.

28:00.983 --> 28:02.985
My family,
- where are they?
- Comfortable.

28:03.159 --> 28:04.683
Having sodas and snacks
down the hall.

28:04.857 --> 28:06.685
You said
you'd let them go.

28:06.859 --> 28:07.947
No, Yu-Lan,
that's not what I said.

28:08.121 --> 28:09.775
I think you're
forgetting an "if."

28:09.949 --> 28:11.211
I'm pretty sure I said
I'd let them go

28:11.385 --> 28:12.386
if you did what I asked.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.301
I got you the program.

28:14.475 --> 28:15.955
Well, I know you say
you got me the program,

28:16.129 --> 28:17.521
but how the hell
would I know?

28:17.696 --> 28:18.958
I mean, I'm a sharp guy,
but I don't know

28:19.132 --> 28:21.003
a damn thing
about software code.

28:21.177 --> 28:23.005
Which is why I went
and kidnapped an expert.

28:23.179 --> 28:24.833
We're fine. I mean,
there are maybe

28:25.007 --> 28:26.008
five people on the planet
who have the skill

28:26.182 --> 28:27.706
to assess that code
in under three days.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.360
This is Mr. Sato Akimasa,

28:30.534 --> 28:32.232
<i>professor in the field
of information technology.</i>

28:32.406 --> 28:33.668
And he's one of them.

28:40.414 --> 28:42.459
You okay, Mr. Chen?
You don't look so good.

28:42.633 --> 28:43.939
He's cracking.

28:44.113 --> 28:45.071
I'm telling you,
he won't hold up.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.857
It wasn't my idea.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.990
<i>I wanted to give you
the program, but they refused!</i>

28:51.164 --> 28:53.557
What wasn't your idea?
Who refused?

28:55.385 --> 28:56.778
The FBI.

28:56.952 --> 28:58.084
<i>They're outside now.</i>

28:59.955 --> 29:01.827
They're listening.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.179
We're going in.

29:10.574 --> 29:12.881
Sir, there's
only three of them.
They cannot go in blind.

29:13.055 --> 29:14.535
We do not know
how many of them
they're up against.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.635
This place is massive.
Where the hell are they?

29:27.809 --> 29:29.289
Aram, we're gonna need
some help here.

29:29.463 --> 29:30.681
Working on it,
I'm trying to access

29:30.856 --> 29:33.032
any blueprints on file
with the city.

29:33.206 --> 29:35.121
Now, Chen's family
may not have
that kind of time.

29:35.295 --> 29:36.644
Dembe took the east side
of the building.

29:36.818 --> 29:37.993
We can't stay here.
We have to keep moving.

29:39.429 --> 29:40.866
What did you do?

29:41.040 --> 29:41.867
I warned you
- what would happen.
- No!

29:42.041 --> 29:43.869
I didn't go to them!

29:52.225 --> 29:53.617
Bring 'em out,
let's go.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.663
Apparently, we have
some company!

29:55.837 --> 29:57.360
- I hear Anderson.
- It's time to greet
our guests!

29:57.534 --> 29:58.622
- Southeast corner.
- All right.
On our way.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.409
Olly Olly Oxen Free!

30:05.716 --> 30:07.240
Nobody wants to play?

30:10.591 --> 30:14.290
Well, perhaps I can provide
motivation to participate.

30:14.464 --> 30:15.770
Wei! Wei!

30:15.944 --> 30:17.467
Who's firing?
Report.

30:17.641 --> 30:19.034
He just shot Chen's wife
in the leg.

30:24.213 --> 30:26.041
I can't kill Chen.

30:26.215 --> 30:28.174
He's the golden goose!

30:28.348 --> 30:31.177
But the others
are entirely up for grabs.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.658
Show yourselves.

30:37.836 --> 30:38.967
Show yourselves!

30:40.751 --> 30:43.058
I believe
- he'll kill them.
- So do I.

30:43.232 --> 30:44.843
Cooper, how do you want
to play this?

30:45.017 --> 30:46.670
Don't give up your weapons.
Hold your position.

30:48.237 --> 30:49.848
Still no takers?

30:50.022 --> 30:51.327
Come out!

30:51.501 --> 30:52.894
I told them you're here!

30:53.068 --> 30:55.331
Agent Zuma!

30:55.505 --> 30:56.855
Agent Zuma.

30:57.029 --> 30:58.900
Well, look at that.

30:59.074 --> 31:00.902
You found me.

31:02.251 --> 31:04.601
I'd say I'm about
to find you.

31:04.775 --> 31:05.864
- No!
- No! No!

31:06.038 --> 31:08.344
The next one... No!

31:08.518 --> 31:09.693
-...goes in the girl.
- No!

31:09.868 --> 31:10.956
He's gonna kill her.

31:11.130 --> 31:12.435
Ressler,
stay where you are.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.308
Please!

31:18.746 --> 31:19.660
Please!

31:20.791 --> 31:22.184
All right, all right!

31:22.358 --> 31:23.533
I'm coming out.

31:23.707 --> 31:24.970
All right,
just hold your fire.

31:29.104 --> 31:29.888
That's one.

31:31.628 --> 31:33.413
Agent Zuma.

31:33.587 --> 31:36.851
You and whoever's with you
has about three seconds

31:37.025 --> 31:38.940
before things end badly.

31:39.114 --> 31:40.986
No!
No!

31:41.160 --> 31:44.163
Wait, no!
Please, please, please!

31:44.337 --> 31:46.034
- Please!
- I'm sorry, Harold.

31:46.208 --> 31:47.818
- No!
- The only move now
is to buy time.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.385
<i>Get backup here
as soon as you can.</i>

31:49.559 --> 31:51.213
Please!

31:51.387 --> 31:53.737
No, no!

31:55.870 --> 31:57.306
Please.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.742
No.

32:02.877 --> 32:04.270
I warned you
not to pursue this.

32:04.444 --> 32:06.315
FBI SWAT's on their way.

32:06.489 --> 32:07.229
Great, thanks
for the heads-up.

32:07.403 --> 32:08.448
We'll be sure
to kill you quickly.

32:08.622 --> 32:09.797
That won't change anything.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.407
The Bureau knows
who you are.

32:11.581 --> 32:13.322
I'll take my chances.

32:13.496 --> 32:14.671
Take Chen and the family
out of here.

32:14.845 --> 32:17.370
- I'll deal with them later.
No! No!

32:17.544 --> 32:19.198
Sir, we got a situation
- at the front entrance.
- Hold them off.

32:19.372 --> 32:20.808
It's not the FBI.

32:20.982 --> 32:21.983
Mr. Anderson!

32:24.203 --> 32:25.595
What the hell is this?

32:25.769 --> 32:26.901
We haven't met.

32:27.075 --> 32:28.468
Y-You're familiar,
of course,

32:28.642 --> 32:30.383
with Vincent Duke
and The Captain.

32:32.646 --> 32:34.474
You're Raymond Reddington.

32:34.648 --> 32:37.129
Imagine, the three of you
in one room.

32:37.303 --> 32:40.045
Somebody get a cat.
Let's see how many Skinners
it takes to...

32:40.219 --> 32:42.482
Not in the mood for jokes?
Fair enough.

32:42.656 --> 32:45.354
It has been a long day
all around.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.748
What are you doing here?
How'd you find me?

32:47.922 --> 32:49.445
We issued a Code Red,

32:49.619 --> 32:51.230
which, if you'd bothered
to read the bylaws,

32:51.404 --> 32:52.971
gives former Skinners access

32:53.145 --> 32:55.234
to when, where, and what
their successor is doing.

32:55.408 --> 32:58.498
Or, in this case,
doing badly.

32:58.672 --> 33:00.674
I don't mind ruthless.

33:00.848 --> 33:03.764
In fact, I'm quite
aroused by it.

33:03.938 --> 33:06.723
It's stupidity that dries me
like the Sahara.

33:06.897 --> 33:08.856
And killing a federal agent

33:09.030 --> 33:10.901
and snatching
an innocent family,

33:11.076 --> 33:12.729
that's about as stupid
as you can get.

33:12.903 --> 33:15.515
I already told you,
it's not your
brand anymore.

33:15.689 --> 33:19.084
Unfortunately for you,
it's not yours, either.

33:19.258 --> 33:20.955
What are you
talking about?

33:21.129 --> 33:22.217
You're a caretaker.

33:22.391 --> 33:23.740
A steward.

33:23.914 --> 33:27.092
A trustee in a long line
of trustees,

33:27.266 --> 33:29.746
and if you violate that trust,
there is a charter

33:29.920 --> 33:32.010
that details how
you can be removed.

33:32.184 --> 33:33.272
By us.

33:33.446 --> 33:34.751
If two former leaders vote

33:34.925 --> 33:36.666
to remove the current
Skinner, he's out,

33:36.840 --> 33:38.538
effective immediately.

33:38.712 --> 33:40.844
You can't be serious.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.324
- I vote you out.
- I agree.

33:42.498 --> 33:44.631
- Out you go.
- This isn't
student government.

33:44.805 --> 33:45.980
You can't remove me
because I decided

33:46.154 --> 33:48.113
not to serve ice cream
in the cafeteria.

33:48.287 --> 33:49.375
You didn't serve
ice cream?

33:49.549 --> 33:50.941
Oh, my gosh,
if they'd known.

33:51.116 --> 33:51.942
Forget about it.

33:52.117 --> 33:53.466
Shoot them.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.120
Shoot them all.

33:57.687 --> 33:58.862
Did you hear me?

33:59.037 --> 34:00.168
That was an order.

34:00.342 --> 34:02.344
Sir.

34:02.518 --> 34:04.259
Fine. I'll do it myself.

34:07.175 --> 34:09.264
Sir, drop your weapon,

34:09.438 --> 34:10.700
or I will fire.

34:10.874 --> 34:12.528
What are you talking about?

34:12.702 --> 34:14.269
You're listening to them?

34:14.443 --> 34:16.097
You work for me.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.578
No, we work
for the organization.

34:18.752 --> 34:20.623
The organization
has rules.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.190
We follow them.

34:22.364 --> 34:23.626
And so do they.

34:24.801 --> 34:25.846
Yeah?

34:27.978 --> 34:29.067
Well, sometimes rules
are meant to be broke...

34:32.766 --> 34:34.898
We should go
before the cavalry arrives.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.161
Make sure
the family's safe.

34:36.335 --> 34:37.553
Once we're gone,
let everyone go.

34:37.727 --> 34:39.599
It's good
to have you back, sir.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.601
Once he was
off the ledge,

34:41.775 --> 34:43.081
you said you'd explain
your interest

34:43.255 --> 34:44.386
in our organization.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.388
So, explain it.

34:46.562 --> 34:49.130
The line of succession.

34:49.304 --> 34:50.784
I hadn't thought about it
coming back to me.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.612
Taking over again.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.570
I can't think of anything
that sounds worse.

34:54.744 --> 34:56.181
It's like meeting
the First Lady

34:56.355 --> 34:57.704
after you've slept
with the President.

34:57.878 --> 35:00.837
Do you want
to run things, Vincent?

35:01.011 --> 35:03.884
The only thing I want to run
is my condo association.

35:04.058 --> 35:05.886
In that case,
I have a suggestion.

35:06.060 --> 35:07.583
Ah, that's it.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.759
You want to pick
my successor.

35:09.933 --> 35:12.327
The Skinners are legendary.

35:12.501 --> 35:14.721
With the right person
in charge,

35:14.895 --> 35:18.116
I don't think there's a limit
to their reach and power.

35:18.290 --> 35:20.248
And as luck would have it,

35:20.422 --> 35:22.990
I think I know who
the right person would be.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.346
You did
what you came for.

35:33.609 --> 35:35.829
There is nothing here
but heartbreak.

35:36.003 --> 35:37.874
I don't believe that.

35:39.049 --> 35:40.616
I can't believe it.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.490
One more stop.

35:44.664 --> 35:47.014
If I don't get the answer
I'm looking for, we'll go.

36:05.598 --> 36:07.817
What are you doing here?

36:07.991 --> 36:13.040
Thinking about
that beautiful,
sad Wyeth painting

36:13.214 --> 36:15.434
you have
in the next room.

36:15.608 --> 36:18.219
I didn't know
you were so melancholy,

36:18.393 --> 36:21.483
with all your
little colloquialisms

36:21.657 --> 36:24.269
and snappy repartee.

36:24.443 --> 36:26.967
- What do you want?
- Something you can't give me.

36:27.141 --> 36:31.276
But which I can't get
without your help.

36:31.450 --> 36:35.628
So, I thought perhaps
we might help each other.

36:40.110 --> 36:42.025
We're just relieved
you and your family are safe.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.506
And Kuo Pai-Han?
My associate in Taiwan?

36:44.680 --> 36:46.378
We spoke to
the authorities in Taipei.

36:46.552 --> 36:48.162
He's being released.

36:48.336 --> 36:49.816
Both he and his family
will be fine.

36:52.122 --> 36:53.254
I believe
this belongs to you.

36:54.864 --> 36:56.605
You're giving it back?

36:56.779 --> 36:58.955
Your government doesn't
insist on keeping it?

36:59.129 --> 37:00.696
Oh, they do,
but our objective

37:00.870 --> 37:01.915
was to prevent it
from falling

37:02.089 --> 37:04.483
into the wrong hands,
including ours.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.314
Thank you.

37:09.488 --> 37:11.490
Your daughter's
with your wife
at the hospital.

37:11.664 --> 37:13.318
Agents are waiting
to take you there.

37:14.667 --> 37:17.191
Mr. Chen,
I'm Agent Soto.

37:17.365 --> 37:19.324
Okay, that was so fun.

37:19.498 --> 37:20.629
Which part?

37:20.803 --> 37:22.283
Rescuing Chen
and nearly dying,

37:22.457 --> 37:24.285
or driving down
a one-way street

37:24.459 --> 37:26.331
into oncoming traffic
and nearly dying?

37:26.505 --> 37:28.768
It was purposeful.

37:28.942 --> 37:32.119
We did something.

37:32.293 --> 37:33.990
Something good.

37:34.164 --> 37:35.340
That's what's cool
about it.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.517
You really miss it,
don't you?

37:38.691 --> 37:40.519
Don't you?

37:40.693 --> 37:42.303
I was positive I didn't.

37:42.477 --> 37:43.696
And now...

37:47.177 --> 37:48.657
Now I'm not so sure.

37:48.831 --> 37:50.137
Pete would kill me
if he heard me say it,

37:50.311 --> 37:52.574
but I wish
we were back full time.

37:54.184 --> 37:55.490
Everyone?

37:55.664 --> 37:57.013
You did a good job.

37:57.187 --> 37:59.494
More than that,

37:59.668 --> 38:01.757
you reminded me
of all the good we did.

38:01.931 --> 38:05.413
I don't know about you,
but I needed that.

38:05.587 --> 38:08.851
I never got to see
the task force
from the inside.

38:09.025 --> 38:12.290
Thank you for doing this

38:12.464 --> 38:14.074
for my partner
and for me.

38:21.081 --> 38:22.038
Good Lord.

38:22.212 --> 38:24.998
If this is how you look
in victory,

38:25.172 --> 38:27.261
I'd hate to see
what you look like
in defeat.

38:27.435 --> 38:28.871
Thought you said
you were going?

38:29.045 --> 38:30.525
I also promised
to bring Harold

38:30.699 --> 38:32.353
a case of Weecha's hooch.

38:35.008 --> 38:37.010
You could probably drink me
under the table,
couldn't you?

38:37.184 --> 38:38.838
Harold, if I might
have a word?

38:39.012 --> 38:41.275
Oh, by the way,
my immunity deal

38:41.449 --> 38:42.755
has been reinstated.

38:42.929 --> 38:44.583
What? By who?

38:44.757 --> 38:48.456
Senator Panabaker agreed
to wave her magic wand.

38:48.630 --> 38:52.155
She's offering
to reconstitute
the task force

38:52.330 --> 38:57.291
and to let Harold,
Donald, and Aram
return to the FBI fold.

38:57.465 --> 38:59.206
Now, why would she want
to do that?

38:59.380 --> 39:01.382
I imagine she likes
the work we do.

39:01.556 --> 39:04.907
- Do or did?
- Mmm, both.

39:05.081 --> 39:06.909
And if you do, as well,

39:07.083 --> 39:09.651
you're welcome to hop back
on the merry-go-round.

39:09.825 --> 39:11.740
If not, <i>a bientot.</i>

39:11.914 --> 39:13.133
Harold?

39:15.004 --> 39:17.659
Did he just say
what I think he just said?

39:17.833 --> 39:20.009
I don't know,
what's <i>"a bientot" mean?</i>

39:21.576 --> 39:23.230
"See you soon."

39:23.404 --> 39:26.146
Which means, be careful
what you wish for.

Care to share

40:10.799 --> 40:12.975
Raymond admires you.

40:13.149 --> 40:16.457
Not because of what you do,
but because of who you are.

40:51.884 --> 40:53.712
and you know how
I feel about that.

40:53.886 --> 40:55.757
What's another?

40:55.931 --> 40:58.499
Unfinished business.

40:58.673 --> 41:00.196
Why do I think
they're connected?

41:02.590 --> 41:03.896
Take the win, Harold.

41:31.576 --> 41:35.710
I have a feeling the next part
of this journey of ours

41:35.884 --> 41:38.539
will be filled
with new surprises.

41:39.975 --> 41:41.586
It's good to be back,
