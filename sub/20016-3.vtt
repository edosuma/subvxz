               [bleep] thing.

21:27.220 --> 21:28.753
I know it gets really
    discouraging

21:28.822 --> 21:30.354
    when you take
    a step back.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.227
    Chin up, man.
You got to get going

21:36.229 --> 21:38.763
  and get some crab
    in the boat.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.834
I'm afraid to, you know,
    I don't want you

21:42.969 --> 21:46.103
to run around the spots
  if you can't do it.

21:46.172 --> 21:47.572
    I might have
  some gear for you

21:47.574 --> 21:50.775
 if you want to take
  advantage of it.

21:50.777 --> 21:53.310
      Sig throws a lifeline
         to his protege,

21:53.379 --> 21:55.679
        a chance to fish
        some of his gear.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.515
              Hell yeah, I do.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.117
                  I'll take
              whatever you got.

21:59.252 --> 22:00.651
    Eighty pots,
     all the way

22:00.653 --> 22:02.853
to the west where you
 and I are together.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.189
  I'll reset them.
  You pick them up,

22:05.191 --> 22:06.524
   get a pick out
  of these things,

22:06.593 --> 22:09.126
  you take them in.
That's going to work.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.594
          Sig's price:

22:10.630 --> 22:12.530
         Jake will have
        to haul the pots

22:12.532 --> 22:15.533
     back to town at the end
         of the season.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.402
            Yeah. That would be,
            actually, fantastic.

22:20.874 --> 22:22.540
      Any time.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.809
Forget all the stuff
that happened today.

It's game-changing time
  for jake anderson.

        to work with me.

24:19.259 --> 24:23.160
           Well, I spent a while
   at the hospital back in April

24:23.196 --> 24:29.600

               for something.

that my white blood cell count's

            of what the doctor's
              going to tell me.

24:50.356 --> 24:52.156

       I just feel myself
         being confident

27:09.662 --> 27:11.962
  because I'm feeling confident
       that we pretty much

28:40.786 --> 28:42.419
       He must be feeling
          really sick.

 When you went through,
 did you see anything different?

32:47.199 --> 32:49.800
              Nothing.
     I have nothing in the gear.

Nothing in the gear?

  Where -- oh, boy.

32:56.208 --> 32:59.209
              They were rough,

      Everything's
starting to change then,

33:03.883 --> 33:05.749

 we were doing like
70 average and stuff.

33:14.193 --> 33:17.094
            Yeah. It just didn't
               pan out for me.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.298
      Okay, man. I'm really glad
           I talked to you.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.099
        I really thought you did
            that on purpose.

33:23.135 --> 33:25.702
                And I was all
            [bleep] bumming out.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.642
If you're questioning
the pots that we gave you,

33:31.777 --> 33:33.577
then that's really [bleep]
       stupid, jake.

33:33.646 --> 33:34.912
Thanks for throwing me
    under the bus.

33:34.914 --> 33:36.579
   Appreciate it.
            No, yeah.

33:36.615 --> 33:40.451
        I didn't know. I thought
    you were [bleep] playing me.

33:40.586 --> 33:41.985
             Oh.
So now I look like a [bleep].

33:43.322 --> 33:45.389
      -No. I didn't mean --
   -we left you good fishing.

33:45.524 --> 33:46.723
Or we thought we did.

33:46.759 --> 33:48.391
                   No, no.
                I said -- no.

             anything like that.

how the offload goes.

35:01.166 --> 35:05.368
       14,000 pounds away
    from covering his quota.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.304
        We're going to be

 Maybe the only one on the boat
     looking forward to it.

            Narrator:
  ...With or without his crew.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.988
   Sounds like 2 weeks of cod
             fishing

35:25.123 --> 35:27.124
         is going to be
       too much for tirey.

35:27.259 --> 35:30.694
    That's pretty surprising.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.462
Tirey: We should be pretty close
         on our numbers.

35:32.598 --> 35:36.166
      We're going to start
      to stack on our pots

35:36.168 --> 35:39.002
       and get the [bleep]
          out of here.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.672
         I mean, I could
     find another engineer.

But he keeps his car in my shop.

           in seattle.

    He's pretty much devoted
   his whole life to the boat.

35:55.754 --> 35:59.822
    And he's willing to throw
   that away over cod fishing?

35:59.858 --> 36:01.491
       Bluff away, my man.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.560
 I'm not going to cater to him.

I just hope that tirey's [bleep]
 attitude towards this cod thing

36:07.966 --> 36:10.100

  as to why he's going to stick
      around and cod fish.

      You know, and I don't want
             to do it by myself.

It's an extra variable
