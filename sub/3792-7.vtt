01:26.200 --> 01:28.500
That's what I call
a service with a smile.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.200
More like a smile I'd like to service.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.800
She's pretty cute, E.
The whole time she smiled at you,

01:33.900 --> 01:35.000
you should get her number.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.600
I don't wanna go out with a waitress.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.600
You believe this guy?
A few years out of Queens,

01:38.700 --> 01:40.400
and he thinks
he's above the working class.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.600
My mother used to wait tables.
I respect them.

01:42.700 --> 01:45.700
I just don't want a relationship with
one of them, They keep shitty hours.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.900
Who said anything about a relationship?

01:48.400 --> 01:52.300
Why do you have to look at everygirl
as a potential relationship?

01:52.500 --> 01:55.200
'Cause I don't wanna spend
my twilight years alone, like you.

01:55.300 --> 01:56.900
E loves falling in love.

01:57.100 --> 01:58.900
E's a nesting creature,
what's the big deal?

01:59.000 --> 02:02.200
'Cause it's not natural for a male,
is the big deal.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.100
I'm not a nesting creature.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.500
Really?

02:06.700 --> 02:10.800
Name one girl
you've ever had unemotional sex with.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.300
Ever.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.400
Lori Wolcott.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.700
You sent her flowers and chocolates
and refused to leave your house

02:19.700 --> 02:22.000
- 'cause she wouldn't be your Valentine.
- I didn't leave

02:22.100 --> 02:24.600
- 'cause I had chicken pox, you loser.
- Wolcott don't count.

02:24.700 --> 02:27.200
All right. What about
the perfect 10 model from Australia?

02:27.300 --> 02:29.900
If I'm not mistaken,
you didn't fuck her. She fucked you.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.000
Not to mention
you called her 2 months after

02:32.200 --> 02:34.600
and the only reason's
'cause you couldn't get a citizenship.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.500
I don't have to prove anything
to you guys.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.500
Don't be mad. It's not our fault.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.900
You were born
without the sport fucking gene.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.800
Come on, guys. I can't just stand here
and let you harass my boy.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.100
I know he can have unemotional sex.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.800
He just chooses not to.
In fact,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.400
I bet he can get some
before the both of you two.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.400
Please, I'm a celebrity again, bro.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.000
I could get laid at a funeral.

02:55.100 --> 02:57.600
And that would be unemotional
for you or the dead girl?

02:57.900 --> 02:58.900
Funny, E.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.200
Be a student of human nature,
no leopard can change its spots.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.100
I've come to accept you
for what you are.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.400
- What's that?
- A pussy.

03:05.500 --> 03:06.700
You're such a pussy in fact,

03:06.900 --> 03:08.700
I bet Turtle can close a broad quicker.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.600
That's it. You're saying Turtle
can get laid quicker than I can?

03:12.700 --> 03:15.800
No, I think he can bring himself
to do it quicker than you can.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.500
I'm so positive in fact,

03:17.700 --> 03:20.400
I'm willing to wage you
5 of my hard-earned G's

03:20.500 --> 03:23.200
that Turtle can close a girl
today before you.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.600
Johnny, are you serious?

03:26.400 --> 03:28.000
These eyes look like I'm bluffing, bro?

03:28.100 --> 03:30.100
You're on.
Come on. I'm taking E. under my wing.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.300
Then I'm taking Turtle under mine.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.000
I ain't betting on this.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.200
And I'm not searching out a girl
just to fuck her.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.600
- Why not?
- 'Cause it's mean.

03:39.500 --> 03:43.900
Mean is when I made Jess Mancini ride
her bike home after I ass fucked her.

03:45.300 --> 03:48.300
Trust me, if you're able to find a girl
who's willing to day fuck you,

03:48.500 --> 03:50.500
she's using you
as much as you're using her.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.600
It's 2007, wake up, pussy.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.400
Oh, he's up. And he's in.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.800
- Whatever.
- So what are the rules?

03:57.300 --> 03:59.000
It's gotta be a complete stranger,

03:59.200 --> 04:01.300
- and E can't call her after.
- It's gotta be free,

04:01.500 --> 04:02.700
he can't pay or bought her.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.600
- Jesus.
- Sorry, Turtle.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.800
On the good chase name, man.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.500
On the good chase name.
Come on, E.

04:08.700 --> 04:10.000
Let's go win us a ribbon.

04:11.600 --> 04:12.600
Catch you guys later.

04:12.700 --> 04:14.900
How am I supposed to get laid
by tonight?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.600
Relax, Turtle. Old Johnny boy's
gonna take you to a place

04:17.700 --> 04:19.600
where even an one-eye leper
can get laid.

04:19.700 --> 04:20.700
Where is that?

04:20.899 --> 04:21.899
Craig's List.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.000
Good to see you.
All right, high five.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.800
All right, so I'm gonna pick you up
after soccer practice,

04:30.900 --> 04:33.200
call me, I brought my cellphone
if you're running late.

04:33.300 --> 04:35.800
- Great, thank you. Bye, Daddy.
- Later, traitor.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
- Ari.
- Daddy.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.000
- I'm kidding, I love you.
- I know you do.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.800
I could so jump this curb right now.

04:40.900 --> 04:44.000
Well, Ari, you may hate this place,
but our daughter still has to go there.

04:46.700 --> 04:47.900
Mr. Preston!

04:49.200 --> 04:51.100
Oh, Mr., Mrs. Gold! How are you?

04:51.200 --> 04:52.600
Well, not so good.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.600
Our son got rejected
from every private school in town.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.100
I'm sorry to hear that.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.100
They didn't happen
to call you about us, did they?

05:01.300 --> 05:02.900
We all stay in touch.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.500
I'm asked questions
and I answer them honestly.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.800
'Course you do.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
All right,
we're up to see another public school.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.200
It's not so bad, you know.

05:10.300 --> 05:12.200
I'm a product
of the public school system.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.300
Me too.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.700
So far I just blackboned
a little cunt, fag, bitch...

05:15.800 --> 05:19.200
- A nice day to both of you.
- ... mother fucker, asshole, fuck me...

05:28.300 --> 05:29.400
Same spot as usual?

05:29.500 --> 05:31.100
- That'd be good. Thanks.
- Awesome.

05:31.300 --> 05:32.600
So, what do you think?

05:32.700 --> 05:34.900
I think this is retarded.
I really do.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.700
I mean, who hits on girls on week days?

05:36.800 --> 05:38.500
E, it's L.A.
Every day's a week-end.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.400
Now just relax, look around.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.400
And let the game come to you.

05:43.700 --> 05:46.100
Those girls over there
would like to buy you guys a drink.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.300
Or to me,
and then to you through me.

05:49.700 --> 05:52.100
- Thank you. That'd be great.
- All right.

05:55.300 --> 05:58.800
Horny heifer seeks back door lover.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.000
- Pass!
- What do you mean, pass?

06:01.100 --> 06:02.500
This isn't about having fun.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.000
- It's about winning the cash.
- How much am I getting?

06:05.100 --> 06:07.700
- For her, 20%.
- Pass.

06:08.100 --> 06:11.400
How about a chick
with a plus-size clit for 30?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.200
It's pass.

06:13.700 --> 06:14.700
What the--

06:14.900 --> 06:16.200
Slide over, let me scroll.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.200
See, this is a little more my speed.

06:22.400 --> 06:26.400
Prom Queen hottie seek
short, cute and cuddly 20-something

06:26.500 --> 06:27.800
to fulfill her fantasies.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.000
Sounds perfect.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.100
Yes, too perfect. She must be a pig.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.100
Call her or I'm calling the heifer.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.100
Put it on speaker.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.600
Is this Kelsey?

06:44.900 --> 06:46.200
<i>Yes, who is this?</i>

06:46.500 --> 06:47.700
I'm calling about your ad.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.000
<i>What about it?</i>

06:49.600 --> 06:51.500
I think I can fulfill your needs.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.600
<i>- What do you look like?
- What do you look like?</i>

06:54.700 --> 06:56.200
Time is of the essence, Turtle.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.500
<i>How many of you are there?</i>

06:58.500 --> 06:59.600
Just me.

06:59.700 --> 07:02.000
<i>'Cause, you know,
I'm not looking for gang bang.</i>

07:02.500 --> 07:05.800
It's just me,
one short cuddly twenty something.

07:05.900 --> 07:07.200
Just what you said you wanted.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.900
<i>Be at Café Primo on Sunset and 30.</i>

07:10.500 --> 07:12.500
<i>Wear a red hat. If I like what I see,</i>

07:12.700 --> 07:14.400
<i>- I'll say hi.
- And if you don't?</i>

07:14.900 --> 07:15.900
Then I won't.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.600
- This is a nightmare.
- No, it's perfect.

07:19.900 --> 07:22.900
And if you close her on the parking lot,
the lattes are on me. Come on!

07:38.200 --> 07:39.300
You gotta be kidding me.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.900
It's play to them,
this is what kids do when they play.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.800
This is what inmates do
when they're gonna overtake the guards.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.200
I mean, is there even a teacher here
or did they lose him the cutbacks?

07:49.300 --> 07:50.300
I know karate.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.600
I saw you kicking
that little redhead boy over there

07:52.700 --> 07:54.600
when he wasn't looking.
That was a very--

07:58.200 --> 08:01.400
No way is my son going to that school.
No way!

08:01.800 --> 08:03.700
Well, Ari, we don't have much choice.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.300
So stop being so dramatic.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.000
Dramatic? Why should I be dramatic?

08:07.200 --> 08:11.500
It's every father's dream to have a son
participate in a kindergarten fatwa.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.600
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking care of business

08:13.700 --> 08:16.100
the way I should've taken
care of business from the start.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.400
Call our special friend
and set the usual meeting place.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.900
- Who is it?
- Don't worry,

08:21.000 --> 08:22.300
I'm not gonna get a...

08:24.300 --> 08:25.300
You girls are from London

08:25.500 --> 08:27.800
and that happens to be
E's favorite city.

08:27.900 --> 08:28.900
Really?

08:29.800 --> 08:31.300
I mean, it just beat out Düsseldorf.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.200
I love Dusseldorf.
Where do you stay when you're there?

08:34.400 --> 08:36.500
I'm only kidding,
I've never been to Düsseldorf.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.500
- But you've been to London?
- Several times,

08:40.600 --> 08:42.400
we stay at the Maria. It's pretty cool.

08:44.900 --> 08:45.900
So...

08:46.400 --> 08:47.600
What are you doing here?

08:47.700 --> 08:48.900
We're here on business.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.200
- What kind of business are you?
- I design linens.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.700
And I'm her top salesrate.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.000
Nice.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.800
They're incredibly soft, the linen.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.700
I could show them to you,

08:59.800 --> 09:02.000
perhaps if you like them,
you could spread the word.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.400
You know, it never hurts
to have a celebrity endorser.

09:04.700 --> 09:07.400
I could never endorse a product
that I didn't actually use.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.500
You would use these, I'm sure.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.500
Come, I'll show you a sample.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.200
- You okay?
- That's fine.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.100
Heather runs my entire company.

09:17.300 --> 09:19.900
She can certainly look
after one shy American boy.

09:20.300 --> 09:21.400
- Shy!
- Ta-ta.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.600
I'm not shy.

09:23.800 --> 09:24.800
No?

09:25.500 --> 09:26.900
How would you describe yourself?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.400
Maybe a little shy.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.200
That's okay.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.500
It's adorable.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.200
Excuse me.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.200
You wouldn't happen to be Kelsie?

09:39.400 --> 09:40.900
Even if I was, I'd say no.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.600
That's just rude, honey.

09:45.900 --> 09:46.900
That ain't her.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.600
Who the hell is she?

09:48.800 --> 09:51.500
You could have railed the heifer
and the plus-sized clit by now.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.100
You Turtle ?

09:54.100 --> 09:55.100
I'm Kelsie.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Who's he?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.500
He's my driver.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.000
Could he wait in the car.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.400
The way he's staring at me,
it's giving me the willies.

10:04.700 --> 10:05.800
Run along.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.200
So... what we do now?

10:11.200 --> 10:12.800
Well, I like what I see.

10:13.100 --> 10:14.100
Really?

10:16.300 --> 10:18.400
Got good padding. You do just fine.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.500
So... what kind of fantasies
are we gonna be fulfilling?

10:22.700 --> 10:23.700
You'll find out later.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.800
First, go to Fazio Cleaners on Rexford.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Pick that up for me.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.100
You want me
to pick up your dry cleaning?

10:29.300 --> 10:30.400
- Is that a problem?
- No.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.800
If we're really gonna be living out
some kind of fantasy

10:33.000 --> 10:34.900
it won't be a problem
to clean your whole house.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.500
Don't be desperate, it's gross.

10:37.800 --> 10:38.800
Here's my adress.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.700
Be there at 9 p.m.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.900
And don't be late, I hate tardiness.

10:56.900 --> 10:57.900
You know, Ari...

10:58.400 --> 11:00.700
We meet so often,
that if another PI was following me,

11:00.800 --> 11:02.100
he'd think we were fucking.

11:02.300 --> 11:05.200
If another PI was following you,
then I would be fucked.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.400
So what can I do for you today?

11:07.700 --> 11:09.700
I need one of your 24/7 tails.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.800
This one has to be on the extreme,
extreme D.L.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.800
So you mean more extreme than
when you had me follow Kate Beckinsale

11:16.000 --> 11:17.600
to see if she was gonna fire her agent?

11:17.700 --> 11:19.600
More extreme, and more discrete.

11:19.800 --> 11:23.200
If anyone finds out about this,
it could be very, very embarrassing.

11:23.800 --> 11:24.800
All right.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.100
Who's the subject?

11:27.700 --> 11:28.900
Andrew Preston.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.900
He is the head administrator
of the Briar Country Day school.

11:38.300 --> 11:41.000
Do you think it was rude of us
living them alone like that?

11:41.400 --> 11:43.500
Are you kidding?
The way they were hitting it off,

11:43.700 --> 11:45.100
it would've been rude of us to stay.

11:45.300 --> 11:46.400
Good point.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.000
So, you guys have a suite?

11:52.100 --> 11:56.100
Yeah, it sucks. Juliette and I have
to share a tiny little bed together.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.300
Really?

11:57.900 --> 11:59.000
Does that turn you on?

11:59.700 --> 12:00.700
I was just--

12:01.100 --> 12:02.600
We are here on business, Eric,

12:02.700 --> 12:04.600
the company pay for my own room
and everything.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.500
I wasn't saying that,
I was just asking, I'm sorry.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.900
No, I'm just playing,
there's no need to apologise.

12:10.100 --> 12:11.200
I'm sorry.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.300
Do I make you nervous?

12:16.700 --> 12:18.600
So you are just nervous usually.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.500
- Do I seem nervous to you?
- You do.

12:20.600 --> 12:23.000
I have a very stressful job.
I actually need another drink,

12:23.200 --> 12:25.000
I haven't seen the waitress around
forever.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.400
- Do you need anything?
- Yeah. You want another drink?

12:28.500 --> 12:30.300
- Four shots of Tequila.
- With limes.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.800
- Of course.
- Laugh at me,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.200
I may use limes,
but I will drink you under the table.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.700
Now we're getting somewhere.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.100
Holy shit.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.500
Oh, Jesus.

12:40.900 --> 12:43.000
Oh, my God. Let me call you back.

12:43.300 --> 12:44.600
I'll be right back.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.300
- You are back.
- Yeah, for a few weeks.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.400
- I didn't know.
- Well,

12:55.500 --> 12:58.100
I figured I shouldn't call you,
you told me not to call, so...

13:01.400 --> 13:03.500
- I'm sorry, hi.
- Hi.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.200
You know what? That's my bad.
Sloan, this is Juliette.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.300
- Heather.
- Really.

13:08.700 --> 13:12.900
Juliette is Heather's friend
and she's with Vince somewhere.

13:14.700 --> 13:17.000
- Right, nice to meet you.
- Me too.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.800
I should get going.
Good to see you, Eric.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.400
I'll see you soon, right?
Okay.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.600
- Bye.
- See you.

13:30.700 --> 13:31.800
Your ex?

13:32.700 --> 13:33.900
Is it that obvious?

13:34.400 --> 13:35.600
She's pretty.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.500
Why did you guys break up?

13:38.300 --> 13:39.600
'Cause I'm an idiot.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
What kind of fantasy involves me
picking up her dry cleaning?

13:47.500 --> 13:49.400
Maybe she wants me
to be her little errand boy.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.400
I don't know,
but I bet she'll be disappointed

13:51.600 --> 13:53.500
when she finds out
you're already Vince's.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.900
Maybe she's into S&M.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.300
Maybe she's even a dominatrix.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.400
You better hope not, Turtle.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.700
Because dominatrix don't fuck.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.500
If you don't get laid,
I don't get paid.

14:04.700 --> 14:05.900
Drama, don't you worry.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.600
Unless she wants to shit on me,

14:07.700 --> 14:10.600
there's no fetish that'll keep me
from getting with that little hottie.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.000
That's the spirit.

14:13.700 --> 14:15.600
- What the fuck is this?
- Yes, I love it.

14:15.700 --> 14:16.900
My bet is safe.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.900
Oh this means something to you?

14:19.100 --> 14:20.100
Oh yeah.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.900
It means you got a furry, bro.

14:22.700 --> 14:23.900
What the fuck's a furry?

14:24.600 --> 14:27.700
Someone who wants to fuck you
like you're a stuffed animal.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.400
Jesus, baby, what's wrong?

14:32.500 --> 14:35.500
<i>You sound worse than when Harry Hamlin
got voted off Dancing with the stars.</i>

14:35.600 --> 14:37.500
Audra Hornig's son
just got accepted to Briar.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.400
Is that the kid
that already has chest hairs?

14:39.600 --> 14:40.700
He's your son's best friend.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.800
He'll be devastated when he finds out
they're not going to school together.

14:43.900 --> 14:45.900
Don't worry. They'll be
going to school together.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.600
- Your man is handling it.
- My man is gonna be handling himself

14:48.800 --> 14:51.100
for the next decade if he doesn't stop
playing it so cool

14:51.200 --> 14:52.500
<i>and tell me what he's up to.</i>

14:52.700 --> 14:54.500
<i>This is like The Godfather, baby.</i>

14:54.600 --> 14:57.100
There're certain times you just
can't ask me about my business.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.600
<i>- But please, don't worry.
- Don't tell me not to worry.</i>

14:59.600 --> 15:01.100
Our special friend is on the phone.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.200
I gotta go. It's all good, baby.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.200
Ari, you are such a fucker!

15:09.100 --> 15:10.100
Talk to me, Eddie.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.300
<i>- Can you come to my office?
- On my way.</i>

15:16.200 --> 15:18.200
- Good news?
- Don't ask questions, Lloyd,

15:18.300 --> 15:20.700
not until you stop
dressing like Paula Poundstone.

15:22.900 --> 15:24.300
Who is Paula Poundstone?

15:26.200 --> 15:28.000
Yeah well, you know nothing gets a girl

15:28.100 --> 15:30.100
hot like listening to a guy
mope about his ex.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.400
Hey, she was a good listener.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.800
So what do we tell the boys?

15:32.900 --> 15:34.900
Tell'em if not for unforeseen events,
I had her.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.200
- It was a done deal.
- I don't think that counts as a win.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.800
- Whatever, it would have been.
- So you're not gonna call her?

15:39.900 --> 15:41.000
Who, sloan or Heather?

15:41.100 --> 15:42.700
- Why Sloan?
- I don't know, to talk.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.200
It seemed she wanted to.
We leave things a little unfinished.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.500
When you broke up with her,
I think it was finished.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.500
- She broke up with me.
- But you made her.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.300
You're feeling bad about it now?

15:51.500 --> 15:52.800
I've been feeling bad for months.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.200
E, what has this day been all about?

15:56.200 --> 15:57.600
I don't know.
You tell me.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.800
Your inability to be unemotional.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.300
You just ran into Sloan
and you're feeling things.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.100
Maybe real, maybe not.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.800
You really want to win this bet, huh?

16:05.800 --> 16:07.500
No, look, forget about the bet.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.900
What you need is a night
to think about what you want.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.300
So sleep on it.
Or sleep on Heather.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.300
- Your choice.
- She was hot.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.900
There you go.
See, why don't I call Juliette

16:17.100 --> 16:19.200
and the four of us will go out
and have a good time?

16:19.200 --> 16:21.200
You're gonna call a girl
after you've fucked her?

16:21.400 --> 16:22.400
Look, I liked her.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.700
And I'm not in on the bet.

16:24.700 --> 16:27.300
I feel like a moron.
This thing doesn't even fit!

16:27.500 --> 16:29.300
I'm supposed to put my dick
through this hole?

16:29.500 --> 16:31.300
- What if it gets stuck?
- What, is it easter?

16:31.500 --> 16:33.200
Maybe we weren't clear on the rules,

16:33.400 --> 16:35.700
but role-playing and fucking each other
doesn't count.

16:36.400 --> 16:40.000
Please, my man here is getting ready
to fuck a real live woman.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.500
Win me five G's.

16:42.300 --> 16:45.000
Unless by some miracle,
E already got laid.

16:45.300 --> 16:46.700
Please tell me you got laid, E.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.900
- It's in the works.
- Jesus!

16:49.000 --> 16:51.200
Quit your whining,
and consider yourself lucky.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.600
A girl like that is a goddess
in the furry community.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.900
You're gonna fuck in that?

16:55.100 --> 16:57.700
Actually, furr-ophiles
refer to it as "boinking."

16:58.800 --> 17:01.500
Wow, Turtle,
this is freaky even for me.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.599
Don't let 'em get in your head.
Furries are people, too.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.800
And all people need to get laid.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.000
Except that whack job,

17:09.099 --> 17:12.000
who only needs a good book,
a cup of tea and a nice long hug.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.500
You're helping Bugs Bunny
string his dick through a hole

17:14.599 --> 17:15.700
and I'm a whack job?

17:16.400 --> 17:18.500
Why don't you just tell us
what you have in the works

17:18.700 --> 17:21.599
that's gonna win this bet before my
"plushious" little friend here.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.800
E's got a hot British chick
just waiting for him to call.

17:25.300 --> 17:28.300
British? Please.
They're too stuffy to fuck that fast.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.600
Well her friend wasn't.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.900
- You got laid, vin?
- Yeah, I had a nice afternoon.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.600
So how come E couldn't close, then?

17:34.800 --> 17:37.200
He hit a little road bump,
but he's coming back from it.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.700
Actually, no I'm not.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.400
- You're gonna call Sloan?
- Yep.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.400
He can't fuck Sloan.
That's against the rules.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.700
No, he ran into her
when he was talking to the brit.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.900
The kid's got some shit luck.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.800
- So this  means the bet's off.
- Off?

17:49.100 --> 17:51.600
It's a forfeit,
and a forfeit results in a loss,

17:51.700 --> 17:53.900
and a loss
is gonna cost you five G's, bro.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.100
All right, Johnny.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.200
I couldn't possibly let Turtle
go through with it anyway.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.600
Love you, Vin.

18:01.300 --> 18:03.700
You do realize
you forfeit your cut too, Turtle.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
How are you?

18:14.800 --> 18:16.200
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

18:20.100 --> 18:21.700
Look, I just wanted to explain...

18:22.300 --> 18:23.500
that today at the pool,

18:23.800 --> 18:26.000
I just met that girl.
I don't even know her.

18:26.500 --> 18:30.200
We're not together anymore
so you don't owe me any explanations.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.300
I know, I know.
I was just...

18:33.200 --> 18:34.300
I was just thinking.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
About what?

18:37.400 --> 18:38.400
About us.

18:38.600 --> 18:42.500
I told you there would be no more us
if you went to Italy for three months

18:42.700 --> 18:44.500
after being away on the movie for six.

18:44.600 --> 18:45.600
<i>I know, I screwed up.</i>

18:45.900 --> 18:48.300
But we could go to dinner
or something, talk about it?

18:52.500 --> 18:53.600
I met someone.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.400
Really?

19:02.400 --> 19:04.600
There he is!
The baddest dick Johnny Wad.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.800
I want to introduce you to one of our
associates. This is Frank Giovanella.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.700
What do I got here. Two dicks
for the price of one. I love it.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.000
Listen. As it turns out,

19:14.100 --> 19:16.300
FranK over here
was hired by another unhappy couple

19:16.500 --> 19:18.400
to dig up the dirt
on your headmaster Preston.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.400
and he's been tailing him
for a couple weeks.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.500
Wonderful. Maybe
we can split the bill, huh?

19:22.600 --> 19:23.700
What do you got?

19:23.900 --> 19:25.500
Unfortunately, sir, I've got nothing.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.100
- What do you mean?
- The guy's clean.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.200
There's no such thing.
Everyone’s got something.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.800
Well, apparently, not this guy.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.400
The guy's a model human.

19:33.700 --> 19:34.800
Look for yourself.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.900
That's him coaching soccer.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.800
Volunteering in a soup kitchen.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.800
Making dinner for his family.

19:41.300 --> 19:42.800
- Jesus...
- Yeah.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.400
He still screws his wife.
She's hot, too.

19:46.100 --> 19:47.100
I gotta tell you,

19:47.300 --> 19:48.800
in all my years in this business,

19:49.000 --> 19:50.500
we've never failed to find the dirt.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.900
I'm sorry.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.700
Hey family, I'm home.

20:15.100 --> 20:16.400
How are you, sweetheart?

20:17.200 --> 20:19.100
- Good.
- I come bearing gifts. Follow.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.300
What happened? I've been calling.
You don't answer your cell.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.700
I was at the bookstore.
I got some great ones for Jonah.

20:24.900 --> 20:27.000
<i>James and the Giant Peach.
One fish, two fish.</i>

20:27.400 --> 20:28.700
<i>And Everyone Poops.</i>

20:29.000 --> 20:30.200
Where's my boy?
Jonah!

20:30.500 --> 20:32.400
- What happened with your friend?
- Nothing.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.400
He did offered to doctor
some photos of Preston

20:34.600 --> 20:37.000
and make him look like he had
a young Filipino boyfriend.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.900
But when he did it,
it made me feel dirty and it hit me:

20:40.000 --> 20:42.700
what school our son goes to
doesn't matter.

20:42.900 --> 20:45.000
It's what type of environment
he comes home to.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.400
That's why I wanna make this
the best place ever.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.300
He's really not getting in, is he?

20:49.500 --> 20:50.600
No, he's not, baby.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.500
But I'm going to read
to him every night.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.200
And we're gonna have
family diners, now.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.800
6 pm, seven nights a week,
no exceptions.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.400
- And no TV.
- Double Ew!

20:59.500 --> 21:02.500
I want to be a better man.
A better father and a better husband.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.700
- How's my little man?
- Good.

21:09.800 --> 21:13.000
You know, Daddy came home early,
just to read to his buddy,

21:13.400 --> 21:15.400
<i>How do dinosaurs say good night?
Is that cool?</i>

21:16.500 --> 21:17.900
- Daddy?
- Yeah, buddy?

21:18.100 --> 21:21.200
Am I going to school with Darrin Hornig
next year?

21:23.100 --> 21:25.100
'Cause I really, really want to.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.100
That would be...
twenty one hundred.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.900
crisp, easily earned dollars.

21:38.100 --> 21:39.500
Twenty two hundred

21:39.700 --> 21:41.500
crisp, easily earned dollars.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.300
I'm out of here.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.500
Go to see Sloan?

21:44.800 --> 21:45.900
Of course, he is.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.500
Just to show my appreciation
for your predictability,

21:49.100 --> 21:51.900
I'm gonna take some of my winnings
to buy you a nice gift certificate

21:52.100 --> 21:54.700
to a farm
that'll help you grow some balls.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.600
That's funny. I appreciate that.
But I'm not going to Sloan's

21:58.700 --> 22:01.500
but to the hotel to fuck that British
chick I met at the pool today.

22:01.700 --> 22:03.400
So Vince, I'd put your cash away.

22:04.700 --> 22:06.300
Looks like the bet still on.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.500
Get your suit on!

22:11.500 --> 22:12.900
Come on, come on!

22:37.300 --> 22:38.300
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.100
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, is Mr. Preston here?

22:41.500 --> 22:42.600
I'm here, honey.

22:43.300 --> 22:44.600
- Everything okay?
- It's fine.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.700
Just tell the kids I'll be right in
and lock the door behind you.

22:48.600 --> 22:49.800
You have a lovely home.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.700
Thank you.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.100
What is the meaning of this?

22:58.200 --> 22:59.800
Well, there's something that I needed...

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
That I'd like to... say to you.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.100
Something different
than what you muttered at me

23:04.300 --> 23:05.600
under your breath this morning?

23:06.100 --> 23:07.200
You heard that?

23:07.500 --> 23:08.700
What do you want, Mr. Gold?

23:08.900 --> 23:12.400
Just a moment of your time
so that I can say to you that through...

23:13.300 --> 23:14.500
this process,

23:14.800 --> 23:16.700
I have learned from you, Mr. Preston.

23:17.300 --> 23:20.600
You are an educator
and you've educated me about...

23:21.700 --> 23:23.300
being a man,
about being a father,

23:23.600 --> 23:25.700
and I know that you can't be bought.

23:27.100 --> 23:30.000
I tried.
I know that you can't be blackmailed.

23:30.300 --> 23:31.600
Because you're too perfect.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.900
But I guess I want to know,
can you be compassionate?

23:37.300 --> 23:38.600
Because, I am...

23:39.400 --> 23:41.700
coming to you, hat and hands,
to ask you...

23:42.400 --> 23:43.700
To beg you

23:44.400 --> 23:46.700
to let my son have a proper education.

23:47.400 --> 23:50.300
And don't make him suffer because
he has a way too aggressive father

23:50.500 --> 23:52.100
that won't shut up on the soccer field.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.100
Please, sir.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.200
Look at you.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.400
Did you ever think
given your high power status

24:04.900 --> 24:07.500
that you'd ever be reduced
to begging and pleading?

24:09.500 --> 24:10.800
No sir, I didn't.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.400
I didn't.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.700
I suppose
there's a first time for everything.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.600
I myself never asked anybody
for anything until now.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.500
Is there something you need?

24:27.300 --> 24:28.400
I have a son,

24:28.600 --> 24:29.800
a special boy,

24:30.400 --> 24:32.400
who works in the mail room at Abraham's.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.100
I think he can do better.

24:35.300 --> 24:36.400
How special?

24:37.800 --> 24:39.700
'Cause, I love special.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.800
Half my lit' department
has an IQ under 65.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.700
So, why don't you tell your boy,

24:46.800 --> 24:49.000
that come Monday,
he's got a desk,

24:49.500 --> 24:52.100
in a real agency
with a real salary.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.700
All right?

24:54.800 --> 24:56.700
The things that we do
for our children, huh?

24:59.100 --> 25:00.400
You tell Jonah,

25:01.100 --> 25:03.200
I'm looking forward to his first day,

25:04.100 --> 25:05.600
at Briar Country Day.

25:06.100 --> 25:08.500
But I still don't want to see you
at any soccer games.

25:13.300 --> 25:14.500
I love this town!

25:28.100 --> 25:31.200
I feel like I'm dropping my kid off
to go trick-or-treating.

25:33.100 --> 25:34.300
Can't do it, Drama.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.800
- Of course, you can.
- No, I can't.

25:38.200 --> 25:41.400
It's bad enough I gotta wear this thing,
but who knows what she'll be wearing?

25:42.100 --> 25:44.400
Who cares
if she's dressed like Godzilla.

25:44.600 --> 25:45.700
Close your eyes.

25:45.900 --> 25:49.300
Like you used to do when you banged that
ugly chick Judy Lipnick in high school.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.200
You thought Judy was ugly?

25:51.800 --> 25:52.900
Is that debatable?

25:53.100 --> 25:54.700
Whatever, I'm not going in.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.500
Fifty percent.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.200
- Sixty.
- You can give me the whole thing,

26:01.300 --> 26:02.600
I just can't do it.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.600
Give me the suit, dick!

26:08.900 --> 26:10.400
What? What are you gonna do?

26:10.600 --> 26:12.100
If I'm dropping five G's,

26:13.200 --> 26:14.800
at least, get me some pussy.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.700
What, am I supposed to sit here?

26:40.300 --> 26:41.500
Should we go?

26:41.700 --> 26:43.100
What do you say if I said:

26:43.300 --> 26:45.200
"let's blow off the restaurant
and order in?"

26:45.800 --> 26:47.400
I'd say: "Come inside!"

26:48.305 --> 26:54.359
