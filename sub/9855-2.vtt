00:02.487 --> 00:04.699
<i>Like all good stories.</i>

00:05.050 --> 00:07.435
<i>This one starts</i>
<i>with a beautiful woman,</i>

00:07.486 --> 00:12.557

00:39.751 --> 00:42.420
Ah!

00:54.433 --> 00:57.535
Help me!

01:32.638 --> 01:35.156
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>this story also starts</i>

01:35.191 --> 01:37.275
<i>with the end of that life...</i>

01:37.309 --> 01:39.160
<i>With her murder.</i>

01:54.460 --> 01:58.162
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning.

01:58.180 --> 01:59.297
Morning, major.

01:59.331 --> 02:01.349
Good morning.

02:01.383 --> 02:03.635
What are you doing here, Louis?

02:03.669 --> 02:05.353
It's Major Daniel,

02:05.387 --> 02:06.888
and I'm here because

02:06.939 --> 02:09.357
I am a member of
the National Police.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.725
Did you send her?

02:10.776 --> 02:11.726
No.

02:11.777 --> 02:13.177
But she's with me.

02:13.695 --> 02:16.447
You are no longer
in the 36, major.

02:16.481 --> 02:18.348
I'm in charge now.

02:18.366 --> 02:20.735
When I was in charge,

02:20.786 --> 02:23.788
I didn't feel the need
to tell everyone.

02:32.131 --> 02:33.298
You were right.

02:33.332 --> 02:34.882
This was the same killer.

02:52.094 --> 02:54.235
Ah!

03:05.564 --> 03:07.415
<i>I was not in a good way.</i>

03:07.449 --> 03:09.250
<i>The truth is,</i>

03:09.285 --> 03:12.086
<i>there were days,</i>
<i>I thought about just giving up.</i>

03:12.121 --> 03:14.505
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>keeping me alive was anger</i>

03:14.540 --> 03:15.540
<i>and morphine.</i>

03:18.594 --> 03:20.044
Commissaire Laveaux.

03:20.078 --> 03:21.245
I need you to keep
this scene sealed

03:21.263 --> 03:22.513
for a couple of days.

03:22.548 --> 03:23.715
Then you have no authority

03:23.749 --> 03:24.882
to seal the scene.

03:24.916 --> 03:26.684
I'm not ordering you.

03:26.719 --> 03:27.935
I'm asking you,

03:27.970 --> 03:29.937
because this may not
be the first victim.

03:29.972 --> 03:32.724
I've had no notification
of any other murder.

03:32.758 --> 03:34.993
That's because she's
the first French victim.

03:35.027 --> 03:37.928
A serial killer is in France.

03:37.946 --> 03:39.564
You have a chance to catch him.

03:39.598 --> 03:40.865
Me?

03:40.899 --> 03:43.100
I need a few days,
and, at the right moment,

03:43.118 --> 03:45.236
I will turn everything

03:45.270 --> 03:46.237
over to you.

03:46.271 --> 03:47.772
You'll take no credit?

03:47.790 --> 03:49.106
No.

03:49.124 --> 03:51.709
Two days.

03:51.744 --> 03:53.961
And I want to be kept informed

03:53.996 --> 03:55.330
of any progress.

03:55.381 --> 03:56.781
Thank you.

03:58.217 --> 04:00.451
The scene will be kept closed.

04:01.446 --> 04:03.175
Where are you going?

04:03.295 --> 04:04.891
Amsterdam.

04:08.927 --> 04:12.563
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>how much that poor young girl,</i>

04:12.598 --> 04:14.816
<i>dead in a park</i>
<i>in the middle of Paris,</i>

04:14.850 --> 04:17.735
<i>was about to change my life.</i>

04:33.369 --> 04:35.002
What the hell
do you mean, "no"?

04:35.037 --> 04:36.087
It's okay,
darling. We can...

04:36.121 --> 04:37.372
Guess
my wife's weight!

04:37.423 --> 04:39.040
I don't do that.

04:39.091 --> 04:40.324
I paid my money!

04:40.342 --> 04:41.592
I read cards.

04:41.627 --> 04:43.544
I can tell you some things
about yourself

04:43.595 --> 04:45.129
and maybe give you
some insight into...

04:45.163 --> 04:46.097
I paid my money.

04:46.131 --> 04:47.632
Now guess her weight!

04:47.666 --> 04:49.550
Hey, why don't you
just leave her alone, pal?

04:50.886 --> 04:53.805
Why don't you mind
your own business?

04:55.057 --> 04:57.024
Hey, you got a problem?

04:59.010 --> 05:00.361
Go to hell.

05:02.064 --> 05:03.347
You want to know
something about yourself?

05:03.365 --> 05:05.867
I'll tell you
something about yourself.

05:05.901 --> 05:07.285
You got soft hands
and no muscle tone,

05:07.319 --> 05:09.237
which mark you for white-collar,

05:09.288 --> 05:10.905
but your eyes
have no spark of intelligence,

05:10.956 --> 05:14.208
and you obviously can't decipher
a simple sign, so guess what?

05:14.243 --> 05:16.160
You're not management.

05:16.194 --> 05:18.529
My guess is you're a drone.
You're a worker-bee.

05:18.547 --> 05:20.364
Top buttonhole's
pulled wide and frayed.

05:20.382 --> 05:21.632
You're fatter
than you used to be,

05:21.667 --> 05:22.867
and you can't afford
a new shirt.

05:22.885 --> 05:24.535
You're not even
a successful worker-bee.

05:24.553 --> 05:25.753
But maybe there's another reason

05:25.804 --> 05:27.805
that you can't afford
a new shirt. Huh?

05:29.425 --> 05:31.225
It's a girlfriend, yeah?

05:31.260 --> 05:33.010
- Hey...
- A mistress? Huh?

05:33.044 --> 05:35.680
But not just any mistress.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

05:35.714 --> 05:37.432
A mistress with a baby.

05:37.483 --> 05:39.550
Your baby. Your baby!

05:39.568 --> 05:41.235
Perhaps you know her, madam?

05:41.270 --> 05:42.737
She's got long blonde hair?

05:42.771 --> 05:44.388
You!

05:44.406 --> 05:45.990
You said you wouldn't
see her anymore!

05:46.024 --> 05:47.725
And now there's a baby?

05:47.743 --> 05:49.610
No, no. Bette!
Let me explain this!

05:49.661 --> 05:50.912
I think it's a boy.

05:50.946 --> 05:54.198
In pounds, I'd say your wife
is 140, 145?

05:54.232 --> 05:56.868
I'm not sure what that is
in kilos, but...

05:56.902 --> 05:58.703
You bastard!

06:00.155 --> 06:02.824
He is a bastard,
but you are not hitting him.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.126
Your wife is getting away.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.544
Go.

06:10.115 --> 06:11.749
You haven't lost your way
with people.

06:11.783 --> 06:14.886
It'd be a better world
without them, yes.

06:14.920 --> 06:18.222
How could you possibly figure
the mistress and the baby?

06:18.257 --> 06:21.509
Why are you at a carnival
in Amsterdam, Louis?

06:26.014 --> 06:29.767
That's what you're doing
with your skills, Carl?

06:29.801 --> 06:33.237
Why are you here?

06:33.272 --> 06:35.639
Do you have somewhere
private we can talk?

06:36.870 --> 06:38.538
Yeah.

06:48.337 --> 06:49.453
How many?

06:49.487 --> 06:50.922
Four.

06:50.956 --> 06:52.489
Including the one in Paris.

06:53.675 --> 06:55.676
A lot of cutting.

06:55.711 --> 06:58.129
He's a bad one.

06:59.664 --> 07:01.432
Carl, do you miss the job?

07:03.685 --> 07:05.686
Still haven't told me
why you're here, Louis.

07:08.607 --> 07:11.008
If you want to
feel like a cop again,

07:11.043 --> 07:14.695
I have a job for you.

07:30.803 --> 07:31.945
Doesn't the I.C.C.

07:32.065 --> 07:33.431
Do war crimes and genocides?

07:33.551 --> 07:35.629
For now, we are going to
try something.

07:35.749 --> 07:36.934
"We"?

07:37.085 --> 07:40.254
I chose a team of cops
from all over the Eurozone.

07:40.272 --> 07:42.357
Each has a special skill.
Like you.

07:42.391 --> 07:44.142
I'm not a cop anymore.

07:44.193 --> 07:46.444
Then I won't have to
pay you much.

07:49.031 --> 07:51.566
Where are we goin'?

07:51.600 --> 07:52.867
If you're gonna shoot me,

07:52.901 --> 07:54.285
you could've done that
in Amsterdam.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.903
Hell, I'd have loaded the gun.

07:55.937 --> 07:57.104
Not with your hand.

07:57.122 --> 07:59.624
Good point.

07:59.658 --> 08:01.456
Can't grip anything
heavier than my joint

08:01.576 --> 08:02.793
without screaming.

08:02.828 --> 08:04.662
"Joint"?

08:04.713 --> 08:07.117
You know... Johnson.

08:07.672 --> 08:08.730
Pecker.

08:08.850 --> 08:09.619
Joint.

08:09.739 --> 08:12.086
Ah... "Braquemard."

08:12.620 --> 08:15.255
You French make everything
sound like a sauce.

08:16.975 --> 08:18.225
But you're still
able to function?

08:18.259 --> 08:21.094
Depends on
your definition of function.

08:21.128 --> 08:23.597
You're very lucky, you know?

08:23.631 --> 08:25.465
Lucky?

08:25.483 --> 08:27.934
That you were born
with a light "joint."

08:32.807 --> 08:34.274
Inspector Sienna Pride.

08:34.308 --> 08:36.076
Scotland Yard.

08:36.110 --> 08:37.410
Interrogation specialist.

08:38.863 --> 08:42.082
Investigator Sebastian Berger,
tech genius.

08:42.116 --> 08:45.285
Polizei Berlin, Germany.

08:45.319 --> 08:49.423
Eva Vittoria, sergeant,
anti-mafia.

08:49.457 --> 08:52.492
Undercover
and covert operations.

08:52.510 --> 08:55.379
Detective Tommy McConnell,

08:55.430 --> 08:58.382
Police Services
Northern Ireland,

08:58.433 --> 09:00.100
weapons and tactical expert.

09:00.134 --> 09:03.921
And Detective Sergeant
Anne-Marie San.

09:04.041 --> 09:07.441
Criminal analyst,
trafficking crimes specialist.

09:08.943 --> 09:11.511
Team, may I present...

09:11.529 --> 09:13.346
Detective First-Grade
Carlton Hickman.

09:13.381 --> 09:14.981
- You prefer "Carl."
- NYPD.

09:15.015 --> 09:17.034
<i>Former NYPD.</i>

09:17.068 --> 09:19.352
Led the department in arrests
six years running.

09:19.370 --> 09:21.187
In convictions, too.

09:21.205 --> 09:23.657
Four years as NYPD liaison

09:23.691 --> 09:25.042
in Europol after 9/11.

09:25.076 --> 09:27.327
Then back to New York,
where you led the department

09:27.361 --> 09:28.912
in arrests again.

09:28.963 --> 09:30.080
Until you were shot
in the hand.

09:30.131 --> 09:31.364
Chasing
a child abduction suspect.

09:31.382 --> 09:34.584
- Who got away.
- But you saved the child.

09:34.635 --> 09:37.213
Impressive use of Google.

09:38.065 --> 09:42.041
Well, here's one thing
I couldn't find on Google.

09:42.060 --> 09:44.261
If you're so bloody good,

09:44.312 --> 09:47.046
why'd the NYPD sack you?

09:48.766 --> 09:52.152
I'm only here because...

09:53.738 --> 09:55.221
Louis asked me to come...

09:55.239 --> 09:57.741
If I'm so bloody good...

10:01.228 --> 10:03.864
You can kiss my ass
in Macy's window.

10:07.285 --> 10:08.452
Macy's window?

10:08.503 --> 10:10.454
It's a shop in New York.

10:10.505 --> 10:12.005
You would know that.

10:12.039 --> 10:14.257
Well, it's not just in New York,
it's all over America.

10:14.292 --> 10:16.626
Why would his "ass"
be in the window?

10:16.677 --> 10:18.295
Waiting to be kissed
by Tommy McConnell.

10:23.551 --> 10:25.585
Carl, please.

10:27.021 --> 10:28.588
I don't need this.

10:28.606 --> 10:30.640
NYPD betrayed you.

10:30.691 --> 10:31.858
It's not fair.

10:31.893 --> 10:33.360
I don't see you

10:33.394 --> 10:36.530
ending up as a garbage man
in a carnival.

10:36.564 --> 10:38.148
I saw you today with that man.

10:38.199 --> 10:40.099
Your mind is sharp as ever.

10:40.118 --> 10:43.737
We have a chance
to stop a killer.

10:43.771 --> 10:45.071
A bad one.

10:45.105 --> 10:46.706
You don't want that?

10:46.741 --> 10:48.742
That's not what you need?

10:57.552 --> 10:59.336
I was sacked

10:59.387 --> 11:01.471
because my bosses were

11:01.506 --> 11:03.590
bastards
who stabbed me in the back.

11:03.624 --> 11:05.458
Also, I'm on
permanent heavy meds,

11:05.476 --> 11:07.894
and I have a useless right hand,

11:07.929 --> 11:10.630
the hand that I write
and shoot with,

11:10.648 --> 11:14.762
so I can't fill out a report
or hold a gun.

11:17.304 --> 11:19.523
Any other questions?

11:21.308 --> 11:22.526
Not right now.

11:22.577 --> 11:23.743
Good.

11:23.778 --> 11:25.245
So let's stop a monster

11:25.279 --> 11:27.146
before he kills another woman.

11:30.638 --> 11:34.753
So, the first victim was in Rome
seven months ago.

11:34.906 --> 11:37.040
A young girl in
Villa Borghese Park,

11:37.074 --> 11:38.241
in the woods.

11:38.292 --> 11:39.659
Same thing in Dublin,
three months later.

11:39.693 --> 11:40.877
Phoenix Park.

11:40.912 --> 11:42.412
London's Richmond Park,
one month ago.

11:42.463 --> 11:45.966
And, night before last,
Parc de Saint-Cloud in Paris.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.467
Each killed in a large park

11:47.501 --> 11:49.202
in a capital city.

11:49.220 --> 11:50.554
He's putting on a show.

11:50.588 --> 11:52.155
Tosser like this always is.

11:52.190 --> 11:53.640
Three months
between the first and second,

11:53.674 --> 11:55.392
three months
between the second and third,

11:55.426 --> 11:57.510
but now only one month
before the fourth.

11:57.544 --> 11:59.346
The time between victims
is getting shorter.

11:59.380 --> 12:01.648
Have any of the women
been identified?

12:01.682 --> 12:03.516
There is nothing
to identify them with.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.819
He did so much damage
to the faces and jaw lines,

12:05.853 --> 12:08.721
it's impossible to compare them
with photographs

12:08.739 --> 12:10.323
or dental records,

12:10.358 --> 12:12.075
and the fingerprints are gone.

12:12.109 --> 12:14.394
Ground off.
Like with sandpaper.

12:14.412 --> 12:16.229
He brings tools.

12:16.247 --> 12:20.250
None of the victims match
any open missing-persons report

12:20.284 --> 12:22.068
as far as height
and hair color.

12:22.086 --> 12:24.537
He also removes
clothing, jewellery,

12:24.571 --> 12:26.623
anything we can use
for secondary identification.

12:26.674 --> 12:28.741
He didn't just conceal
their identities,

12:28.759 --> 12:29.843
he erased them.

12:29.877 --> 12:31.711
He'll mess up.
They always do.

12:31.745 --> 12:33.930
Prostitutes
sometimes go missing.

12:33.965 --> 12:36.299
These women
don't look like, uh...

12:36.350 --> 12:37.917
They're not the street types.

12:37.935 --> 12:40.387
They seem healthy,
in relatively good shape.

12:40.421 --> 12:41.388
No signs of drug use.

12:41.422 --> 12:43.723
How can four
young girls be dead

12:43.757 --> 12:44.608
and no one is
looking for them?

12:44.642 --> 12:46.977
We've got nothing at all

12:47.028 --> 12:49.062
but four faceless,
nameless bodies.

12:49.096 --> 12:51.481
That's not necessarily true.

12:53.651 --> 12:55.619
Every fact has a reverse.

12:55.653 --> 12:58.238
Having no identifying
information means...

12:58.272 --> 12:59.823
Could mean...

12:59.874 --> 13:02.158
That he went to a lot of trouble
to keep them unidentified.

13:02.209 --> 13:04.777
Bastard...

13:04.795 --> 13:05.962
Why do that?

13:05.997 --> 13:08.832
If they were connected to him.

13:09.717 --> 13:11.451
If we I.D. them...

13:12.666 --> 13:15.088
It probably would lead
directly to him.

13:15.122 --> 13:16.456
So, job one,

13:16.474 --> 13:17.724
who are all these women?

13:17.758 --> 13:21.094
Sienna and Tommy,
go to the Paris morgue

13:21.128 --> 13:22.312
and follow up with the body.

13:22.346 --> 13:23.396
Straight away, sir.

13:23.431 --> 13:24.630
Anne-Marie, take Hickman

13:24.649 --> 13:26.966
to the Parc de Saint-Cloud
crime scene.

13:26.984 --> 13:29.352
Sebastian, go as well,
and use your new equipment.

13:29.403 --> 13:31.137
Very good, sir.

13:31.155 --> 13:32.238
We should be able
to join you all

13:32.273 --> 13:34.328
in Paris by nightfall.
All right?

13:40.481 --> 13:42.699
Got a ticket in my name?

13:42.750 --> 13:44.117
Pretty confident I'd join up.

13:45.169 --> 13:46.619
Eva, you're with me.

13:46.653 --> 13:48.672
Okay.

14:16.534 --> 14:18.184
How much of that do you take?

14:19.320 --> 14:21.321
I follow the directions.

14:21.355 --> 14:24.290
Can we trust
your brain on that?

14:24.325 --> 14:26.376
I probably wouldn't.

14:26.410 --> 14:27.794
Drink?

14:27.828 --> 14:28.795
No.

14:29.579 --> 14:33.082
Irishman refuses a drink.

14:33.116 --> 14:35.634
Alert the media.

14:35.669 --> 14:37.002
A cocky American.

14:37.053 --> 14:38.620
Who saw that coming?

14:40.474 --> 14:42.092
Whiskey?

14:42.143 --> 14:43.727
Six Euros.

14:46.180 --> 14:47.847
How much did you win
in your last fight?

14:49.550 --> 14:52.852
Or was it just a feud thing?

14:56.574 --> 14:58.441
This your way of impressing me?

14:58.492 --> 15:00.226
You reckon I'll go all chilly

15:00.244 --> 15:03.029
'cause you deduced
I bare-knuckle fight?

15:06.283 --> 15:08.251
Broken 51 times,

15:08.285 --> 15:09.536
grew back wanky.

15:09.570 --> 15:11.204
Anyone can see it.

15:11.238 --> 15:12.872
Not too many ways that happens,

15:12.906 --> 15:14.340
past punching things
without gloves on.

15:14.375 --> 15:16.742
My less-than-posh
Irish background

15:16.761 --> 15:18.795
points to bare-knuckle
clan fighting,

15:18.846 --> 15:22.182
and my still-pretty face
says I usually win.

15:24.418 --> 15:28.921
You're no smarter than me,
super-detective.

15:28.939 --> 15:31.357
You're an angry guy, Tommy.

15:32.893 --> 15:35.111
That's gonna get in your way.

15:35.146 --> 15:37.363
You saying you're not angry?

15:38.566 --> 15:40.150
I'm saying

15:40.201 --> 15:43.069
the last person in the world
you want to end up like is me.

15:55.606 --> 15:56.983
All right.

15:59.456 --> 16:02.375
Sergeant Vittoria
of the N.O.C.S. in Rome.

16:02.409 --> 16:03.676
This is...

16:03.711 --> 16:06.462
Mikael Lechnya Dorn.

16:06.513 --> 16:07.680
I'm honored, sir.

16:07.715 --> 16:09.415
I know of your work

16:09.433 --> 16:11.217
with the International
Criminal Court.

16:11.251 --> 16:13.269
"Sir?"

16:13.304 --> 16:16.022
I'm Dorn. Just Dorn.

16:17.891 --> 16:19.859
They refused
to sanction your team.

16:19.893 --> 16:21.027
What?

16:21.061 --> 16:22.362
I warned you, Louis.

16:22.396 --> 16:24.781
My hands are pretty much tied.

16:24.815 --> 16:27.600
They're very cautious,
those men in there.

16:27.618 --> 16:28.735
They don't seek

16:28.769 --> 16:31.237
fame, money, ambition.

16:31.271 --> 16:33.106
They're incorruptible,

16:33.140 --> 16:34.374
which means it's
very difficult

16:34.408 --> 16:35.941
to make a deal with them.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.994
Did they give
a reason for refusal?

16:38.045 --> 16:39.712
Yeah. They're concerned
that they would be,

16:39.747 --> 16:42.832
or would appear to be,
usurping the power

16:42.883 --> 16:44.250
of sovereign states.

16:44.284 --> 16:45.785
I'm not asking for power,
I just want to do my job.

16:45.803 --> 16:48.004
Well...

16:48.055 --> 16:51.424
You're going to have to find
another way to do your job.

16:51.458 --> 16:52.809
I don't understand.

16:52.843 --> 16:55.478
The workings of the court
are very complicated...

16:55.512 --> 16:56.929
Not them.

16:56.963 --> 16:58.097
You.

16:59.016 --> 17:01.934
I don't understand you.

17:01.968 --> 17:04.237
I beg your pardon?

17:05.321 --> 17:08.185
I read something
you wrote once,

17:08.306 --> 17:11.031
in a report on Kosovo.

17:11.702 --> 17:16.003
"The mothers and wives
of missing Serbs

17:16.124 --> 17:18.578
are begging for
their loved ones to be found,

17:18.698 --> 17:20.481
but they never will be.

17:21.922 --> 17:22.872
This court is..."

17:22.923 --> 17:25.458
"Is the only place
for them to turn.

17:25.492 --> 17:28.160
We weep

17:28.178 --> 17:30.463
for those
no one else weeps for."

17:32.016 --> 17:35.034
Exactly.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.856
Four women have been butchered
by the same man

17:39.890 --> 17:42.058
in four different countries.

17:42.109 --> 17:44.060
That man will never be caught

17:44.111 --> 17:45.445
because the authorities in Rome

17:45.479 --> 17:47.780
don't talk to Dublin,
who don't talk to Paris,

17:47.815 --> 17:49.866
who don't talk to London.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.984
I mean,
I-it's not their fault,

17:52.018 --> 17:54.287
but that's the way it worked

17:54.321 --> 17:57.323
until Major Daniel
brought us together.

17:58.559 --> 18:00.910
Maybe one day,
we won't need it,

18:00.961 --> 18:02.412
but right now,

18:02.463 --> 18:05.131
this court is the only place

18:05.165 --> 18:07.050
for these women to turn.

18:07.084 --> 18:10.753
No one else weeps for them.

18:10.804 --> 18:13.139
No one.

18:15.142 --> 18:17.260
We're adjourned.

18:17.311 --> 18:19.479
It's a crime of aggression

18:19.513 --> 18:22.715
that is ongoing, systematic
and cross-border.

18:22.733 --> 18:25.485
This is exactly
what the I.C.C. does.

18:28.072 --> 18:30.990
Sorry.

18:31.024 --> 18:33.276
No. It's fine.

18:34.394 --> 18:39.248
What man doesn't like a woman
to tell him how brilliant he is?

18:41.168 --> 18:43.252
Get ready to travel.

18:43.287 --> 18:44.921
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

18:56.750 --> 18:58.718
I.C.C. team
from The Hague?

18:58.752 --> 19:00.186
<i>- Ca va?</i>
<i>- Ca va.</i>

19:00.220 --> 19:02.021
Major Daniel said
two cars would be sufficient.

19:02.055 --> 19:03.022
<i>C'est les deux-la.</i>

19:03.056 --> 19:04.273
- Okay.
<i>- D'accord.</i>

19:04.308 --> 19:05.758
- Merci, Detective Moreau.
<i>- Avec plaisir.</i>

19:05.776 --> 19:06.893
That's service.

19:06.927 --> 19:07.944
I.C.C. team?

19:07.978 --> 19:09.112
I didn't know we had a name.

19:09.146 --> 19:10.897
It's like we're
the Justice League

19:10.931 --> 19:13.149
or something.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.200
"Justice League?"

19:14.234 --> 19:15.485
It's an American comic book

19:15.536 --> 19:16.953
about a team
of super-heroes.

19:16.987 --> 19:18.204
How do you lot not know that?

19:18.238 --> 19:19.789
What did you read
when you were kids?

19:19.823 --> 19:21.124
- Biographies.
- Encyclopedias.

19:21.158 --> 19:22.625
Things with
grown-up words.

19:22.659 --> 19:24.744
Guess I didn't get
the same books

19:24.778 --> 19:26.662
as you Cheltenham
Girls' School lot.

19:26.713 --> 19:28.047
Cheltenham "ladies," actually.

19:28.081 --> 19:29.048
All right, ladies, is it?

19:29.082 --> 19:30.333
We'll see you
at the crime scene.

19:30.384 --> 19:32.135
Tommy!

19:32.169 --> 19:33.753
Hey, I drive.

19:33.787 --> 19:35.054
Oh, grow up.

19:45.913 --> 19:47.853
Ah, stay, stay, stay.

19:51.605 --> 19:54.791
The magistrate is
writing up an order,

19:54.826 --> 19:57.244
authorizing you to investigate

19:57.278 --> 19:58.444
this crime series.

19:58.463 --> 19:59.246
This series only.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.630
Thank you, Dorn.

20:00.665 --> 20:02.598
Thank Sergeant Vittoria.

20:04.085 --> 20:06.670
It's always the same.

20:06.721 --> 20:09.139
A woman's mind is...

20:09.173 --> 20:12.626
quite extraordinary.

20:12.660 --> 20:14.794
Here.

20:17.097 --> 20:19.548
You are doing this
for the right reasons,

20:19.566 --> 20:20.766
aren't you, Louis?

20:21.902 --> 20:24.219
This is about the women,
about the job, yes?

20:24.238 --> 20:26.739
You are not using everyone

20:26.773 --> 20:28.608
to further another end,
are you?

20:28.659 --> 20:31.060
What do you want me to say?

20:31.078 --> 20:33.246
The truth.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.397
I don't know.

20:40.837 --> 20:43.039
How is Rebecca?

20:43.073 --> 20:45.591
The same.

20:45.626 --> 20:47.242
Thank you.

20:49.296 --> 20:51.347
Your order.

20:53.433 --> 20:55.551
Be wary, my friend.

20:55.585 --> 20:58.137
"Those to whom
evil is done..."

20:59.640 --> 21:02.525
"...do evil
in return."

21:02.559 --> 21:03.726
You quote Auden to me?

21:06.446 --> 21:09.231
Serves you right.
You gave him to me.

21:09.265 --> 21:10.533
Yeah.

21:10.567 --> 21:14.287
It also says
"We must love each other..."

21:14.321 --> 21:16.489
"...Or die."

21:16.540 --> 21:18.074
I can assure you

21:18.108 --> 21:21.327
that those
conventional authorities

21:21.378 --> 21:23.079
in those countries

21:23.113 --> 21:25.247
will not love you.

21:25.281 --> 21:26.632
Probably not.

21:27.884 --> 21:29.919
Thank you.

22:04.105 --> 22:05.088
Afternoon, detective.

22:05.106 --> 22:06.890
Bonjour, Officer Laffont.

22:06.924 --> 22:08.803
This is Detective Hickman.

22:11.262 --> 22:12.729
Are the neighbours
giving you a hard time?

22:12.763 --> 22:14.597
I can't really blame them.

22:14.615 --> 22:15.899
They just want to
use their park.

22:15.933 --> 22:17.651
Yeah. We'll try to
finish up by today, okay.

22:17.702 --> 22:18.985
Is it true, ma'am?

22:19.036 --> 22:20.704
Commissaire Laveaux
of the crime squad

22:20.738 --> 22:22.823
is calling him another ripper,
like the one in London.

22:22.874 --> 22:24.241
There's a difference.

22:24.275 --> 22:25.942
This one's gonna be caught.

22:25.960 --> 22:29.463
Merci. Shall we?

22:37.778 --> 22:39.627
Is that a Compass Rose?

22:40.489 --> 22:42.374
Mind your business.

22:42.425 --> 22:44.542
Oh, it's something
you want to hide?

22:45.795 --> 22:49.431
Why get a tattoo
you need to hide?

22:49.465 --> 22:51.466
You interrogating me?

22:55.137 --> 22:57.222
I'm ready.

22:58.858 --> 23:02.110
We'll finish this.
Later.

23:02.144 --> 23:04.229
No. We won't.

23:04.280 --> 23:08.015
Do you really think
we'll catch this ripper?

23:08.034 --> 23:09.784
Don't call him that.

23:09.819 --> 23:11.686
Jack the ripper
killed five women

23:11.704 --> 23:13.538
in five completely
different locations.

23:13.572 --> 23:17.625
Every scene was more brutal
than the last.

23:18.828 --> 23:22.247
He took prizes, body parts.

23:22.298 --> 23:23.665
Everything for him
was post-kill.

23:23.699 --> 23:25.333
This guy

23:25.367 --> 23:28.086
does the same thing every time,
in the same type of place.

23:28.137 --> 23:31.639
He seems to have
some sort of ritual

23:31.674 --> 23:33.797
that plays out
before the murder.

23:33.917 --> 23:34.921
Everything after

23:35.041 --> 23:36.806
is to conceal the crime.

23:36.926 --> 23:40.181
They couldn't be
more different.

23:40.951 --> 23:41.984
Any idea how he got her here?

23:42.002 --> 23:44.537
No vehicle tracks,
if that's what you mean.

23:44.588 --> 23:47.229
That's what I mean.
Footprints?

23:47.349 --> 23:49.130
This park
is very well-travelled.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.582
We even tried focusing
on only the barefoot prints,

23:51.702 --> 23:53.044
but there are just too many.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.998
What's that?

23:56.016 --> 23:59.802
It's a variation on
a virtual autopsy device.

23:59.836 --> 24:02.638
It uses
light-amplification beams

24:02.672 --> 24:05.441
to scan a scene
thousands of times

24:05.475 --> 24:08.143
so we can recreate it
later, holographically.

24:08.177 --> 24:10.279
I call it "Scangen,"

24:10.313 --> 24:13.015
because it, well,
it generates scans.

24:24.995 --> 24:27.162
This guy is very short.

24:27.196 --> 24:28.998
Maybe 5'5", at the most.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.049
How do you know that?

24:31.468 --> 24:33.636
See the blood splatter
from the knife

24:33.670 --> 24:35.704
on the bottom of the leaves?

24:35.722 --> 24:37.706
Yeah?

24:38.875 --> 24:42.044
That's the upstroke.
Goes way up there, right?

24:42.062 --> 24:43.729
But now look at
the tops of the leaves.

24:45.214 --> 24:47.099
The splatter
from the downstroke

24:47.150 --> 24:48.734
is at six-feet or below.

24:48.768 --> 24:50.719
A man with his arm
raised above head

24:50.737 --> 24:52.771
usually picks up the length of
his lower arm in height.

24:52.822 --> 24:53.822
My height...

24:53.857 --> 24:55.908
His height.

24:58.161 --> 25:00.613
Now, what does this new fact
tell you that you didn't know?

25:00.664 --> 25:02.364
Small feet.

25:02.398 --> 25:03.916
Small feet. Yeah.

25:13.376 --> 25:15.010
<i>Hello.</i>

25:15.045 --> 25:16.078
<i>This is the Daniel family.</i>

25:16.096 --> 25:18.764
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

25:19.916 --> 25:22.584
<i>Rebecca, it's me again.</i>

25:22.602 --> 25:24.586
<i>Please...</i>

25:24.604 --> 25:26.939
<i>I just want to talk.</i>

25:33.746 --> 25:34.746
Are you ready, sir?

25:34.780 --> 25:36.781
Yes. I'm ready.

25:41.204 --> 25:42.788
Scanning.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.547
Two sets going north.

25:51.581 --> 25:52.681
One barefoot...

25:52.716 --> 25:54.383
One wearing small boots
or work shoes.

25:54.417 --> 25:55.301
The strides are fairly long.

25:55.335 --> 25:56.284
They were running.

25:56.303 --> 25:58.137
Well, he was chasing her.

25:58.171 --> 26:00.506
Then, just this set
of small tracks

26:00.557 --> 26:02.007
goes back South.

26:03.510 --> 26:05.594
Hickman.

26:05.628 --> 26:07.629
Look. There's blood, too.

26:07.647 --> 26:12.651
She was already bleeding
when he was chasing her?

26:12.686 --> 26:14.186
Maybe he attacked her
somewhere else, and she escaped.

26:14.237 --> 26:16.405
A secondary crime scene
would be valuable.

26:18.575 --> 26:20.442
Oh, hold on. Look. Look.

26:21.477 --> 26:22.811
Yeah.

26:22.829 --> 26:24.980
Why do his return tracks
criss-cross like that?

26:24.998 --> 26:27.315
Looks like he was lost
after he killed her.

26:27.334 --> 26:28.117
Or looking for something.

26:28.151 --> 26:29.668
Something important enough

26:29.703 --> 26:31.920
to take the chance of being
discovered with a dead body

26:31.955 --> 26:33.422
in the clearing.

26:33.456 --> 26:34.840
Important enough to look for,
instead of escaping.

26:34.874 --> 26:36.041
Evidence.

26:36.092 --> 26:38.344
<i>There are multiple</i>
<i>deep lacerations</i>

26:38.378 --> 26:40.462
from a large bladed weapon, ,,

26:40.496 --> 26:42.464
was she dead
when her face was damaged?

26:42.498 --> 26:44.166
Oh, probably.

26:44.184 --> 26:46.018
The angle of those wounds
indicate she was already prone.

26:46.052 --> 26:47.770
Looks very angry.

26:47.804 --> 26:49.171
But also methodical.

26:49.189 --> 26:50.389
At key points,

26:50.440 --> 26:52.141
there are shallow
puncture wounds...

26:52.175 --> 26:55.144
At the wrist,
in her inner thighs...

26:55.178 --> 26:56.228
On arteries.

26:56.279 --> 26:58.147
He cut her wrists?

26:58.181 --> 26:59.565
Ah, he punctured them.

26:59.616 --> 27:01.734
She bled, but not quickly.

27:01.785 --> 27:03.869
It would be a...
A steady ooze.

27:03.903 --> 27:06.488
And these appear to have been
the first wounds made.

27:06.522 --> 27:09.041
Why would he do that?

27:09.075 --> 27:11.076
To weaken her.

27:12.078 --> 27:13.912
Like a jab for a fighter.

27:13.963 --> 27:15.297
Bloody him up first

27:15.331 --> 27:17.866
before you get in close
and finish him off.

27:20.837 --> 27:22.421
Excuse me.

27:25.308 --> 27:28.010
How long have you been
a detective in Paris?

27:28.044 --> 27:29.895
I'm not.

27:29.929 --> 27:32.147
I work mainly

27:32.182 --> 27:34.817
on border crimes
out of offices in Lyon.

27:34.851 --> 27:37.102
It was Major Daniel
who brought me here.

27:37.153 --> 27:38.904
Really?

27:38.938 --> 27:40.239
That surprises you?

27:40.273 --> 27:41.657
We've talked

27:41.691 --> 27:43.492
to two Parisian police officers
since we arrived,

27:43.526 --> 27:44.893
neither of them had nametags,

27:44.911 --> 27:46.779
yet you called them both
by name.

27:46.830 --> 27:49.832
Oh, that's...
that's something I have.

27:49.866 --> 27:51.617
I remember.

27:51.668 --> 27:53.589
You're eidetic?

27:55.588 --> 27:58.073
My doctors call it
hyperthymesia.

27:58.091 --> 27:59.341
Doctors?

27:59.375 --> 28:00.843
Yeah. My mother's a physician.

28:00.877 --> 28:01.960
Oh.

28:02.011 --> 28:03.178
When I was a child,

28:03.213 --> 28:05.380
she thought
I might be autistic,

28:05.414 --> 28:07.249
so she had an MRI
done of my brain,

28:07.267 --> 28:08.767
and they found
an enlarged temporal lobe

28:08.802 --> 28:09.885
and Caudate Nucleus.

28:11.020 --> 28:12.087
That's a mouthful.

28:12.105 --> 28:15.590
It's found in people
with O.C.D.

28:16.609 --> 28:17.726
Sorry.

28:19.062 --> 28:20.729
Anne-Marie San.

28:22.365 --> 28:25.379
That would make sense
with what we're finding here.

28:25.499 --> 28:27.101
Yeah. We're here.

28:28.203 --> 28:29.185
That was Sienna.

28:29.220 --> 28:30.353
The coroner says

28:30.387 --> 28:31.688
he might have
wounded her first.

28:31.722 --> 28:33.223
Some arteries were nicked.

28:33.257 --> 28:36.309
Started her bleeding,
and then...

28:36.360 --> 28:37.894
Then let her run.

28:37.928 --> 28:39.062
Son of a bitch hunted her.

28:40.363 --> 28:42.148
He's a sadist.

28:42.199 --> 28:45.935
She was dead
the moment she showed him fear.

28:47.037 --> 28:48.404
Is there something else?

28:48.438 --> 28:50.439
It's just a bit odd

28:50.458 --> 28:53.076
for a sadist to put on a show
like this.

28:53.110 --> 28:54.461
They're usually...

28:54.495 --> 28:57.057
Usually a bit more...

28:57.177 --> 28:58.706
Private.

29:03.755 --> 29:04.555
Look.

29:04.589 --> 29:08.509
She had one shoe on...

29:08.543 --> 29:10.427
When she got to this root,

29:10.478 --> 29:12.129
and then she was barefoot.

29:14.482 --> 29:15.349
She lost a shoe.

29:18.603 --> 29:19.553
Look at her tracks.

29:19.571 --> 29:20.604
He found it.

29:20.655 --> 29:21.721
He was looking for her shoes?

29:21.740 --> 29:25.892
He found one,
maybe not the other.

29:25.910 --> 29:28.028
Just needed some water.

29:30.949 --> 29:34.668
It's not the blood
or the damage,

29:34.702 --> 29:36.537
it's the smell in
these places, you know?

29:36.571 --> 29:38.905
You never hear of
olfactory fatigue?

29:40.458 --> 29:43.293
Take a couple of deep breaths.
You won't notice it soon enough.

29:43.344 --> 29:46.213
I'm saying
the smell bothers me,

29:46.247 --> 29:47.464
you're saying
suck up more of it?

29:47.515 --> 29:48.632
It works.

29:50.251 --> 29:51.301
What, growing up
in Traveller Camps,

29:51.352 --> 29:52.386
you never got used to
bad smells?

29:52.420 --> 29:54.087
I mean, that's
the tattoo, right?

29:54.105 --> 29:55.305
The compass rose?

29:55.356 --> 29:56.473
You're an Irish Traveller.
Your family are criminals.

29:56.524 --> 29:58.308
Wow.

29:58.343 --> 29:59.726
We're showing
our true colours now,

29:59.760 --> 30:00.778
aren't we?

30:01.896 --> 30:03.397
Inspector Pride.

30:23.134 --> 30:25.886
What have you done?

30:25.920 --> 30:28.222
What have you done?

30:36.130 --> 30:38.065
<i>Major Daniel?</i>

30:38.733 --> 30:39.799
Major Daniel?

30:39.818 --> 30:40.984
You okay?

30:42.987 --> 30:44.571
Y-yeah.

30:44.606 --> 30:45.472
Yeah.

30:45.490 --> 30:46.907
You sure?

30:46.941 --> 30:49.359
Yes, I'm fine now.

30:49.410 --> 30:51.995
Okay.

30:52.831 --> 30:55.165
She had on both shoes here.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.983
Look.

30:57.001 --> 30:58.485
One shoe here.

31:00.154 --> 31:02.539
Okay... okay... this... this...

31:02.590 --> 31:03.290
Search...

31:03.324 --> 31:04.508
Ah!

31:04.542 --> 31:05.459
Hickman! Are you okay?

31:05.493 --> 31:07.261
Oh!

31:07.295 --> 31:08.662
I'm fine.

31:08.680 --> 31:09.880
Let's just look.

31:12.333 --> 31:15.352
It's okay! It's okay.
I'll... I'll do it.

31:21.676 --> 31:23.894
Oh, wait.

31:37.542 --> 31:38.858
It says, uh...

31:38.877 --> 31:40.577
"C. G."

31:40.628 --> 31:41.962
That's "Charles Gallant."

31:41.996 --> 31:44.698
A pair of shoes costs
more than 1,500 pounds.

31:44.716 --> 31:46.750
That's almost 2,000 Euros.

31:46.801 --> 31:49.586
If she is a pro,
she's a good one.

31:52.014 --> 31:54.878
First piece of actual evidence
he's left behind.

31:54.888 --> 31:56.272
Hard to believe we're
looking at wealthy victims.

31:56.323 --> 31:58.408
- Who no one's looking for?
- Exactly.

31:58.442 --> 32:00.226
And yet, it's odd.

32:01.445 --> 32:03.580
It's actually a very old style.

32:03.614 --> 32:04.998
Inspector Pride has
a fashion criticism

32:05.032 --> 32:06.399
for the victim.

32:06.417 --> 32:07.951
- What do you mean by "old"?
- It looks vintage.

32:08.002 --> 32:09.953
It's unusual
for Charles Gallant.

32:10.004 --> 32:12.622
Do you think
he sells a lot of these?

32:12.673 --> 32:14.791
I don't know many people
who can afford them.

32:14.842 --> 32:16.676
Don't.

32:16.710 --> 32:17.961
If I sold shoes like these,

32:18.012 --> 32:19.512
I'd want to keep track
of who bought them,

32:19.547 --> 32:20.746
so I could sell them more.

32:20.765 --> 32:22.465
Which means a database.

32:22.516 --> 32:23.800
The main dealer's
here in Paris.

32:25.136 --> 32:26.252
I'll make a call.

32:29.557 --> 32:31.307
Allo, bonjour,
this is Detective San.

32:31.358 --> 32:33.393
Do you keep a record
of your clients?

32:33.427 --> 32:36.146
Can we come and see you? Now?

32:36.197 --> 32:38.364
Thank you.
We'll be right there.

32:40.534 --> 32:42.819
So, not only do they keep track
of their customer base,

32:42.870 --> 32:44.270
but the shoes are handmade.

32:44.288 --> 32:46.322
There's a serial number
in the sole of each shoe

32:46.373 --> 32:47.824
that corresponds
to the customer.

32:47.875 --> 32:49.075
Which means a name.

32:49.109 --> 32:50.326
Yeah. The store's
about to close,

32:50.377 --> 32:51.944
but the manager's
waiting for us.

32:51.962 --> 32:54.297
Let's go.

32:54.331 --> 32:58.001
You three wait for Louis
at the crime scene. We'll go.

33:03.290 --> 33:07.510
Eva, I want to apologize
for what happened on the train.

33:07.561 --> 33:10.814
No good cop
can sleep well, sir.

33:11.849 --> 33:12.765
Yeah. Major Daniel.

33:12.799 --> 33:15.318
Hey. Well,
it's like I said, Louis.

33:15.352 --> 33:18.488
They're not happy
with your change in assignment.

33:18.522 --> 33:20.323
The French are up in arms.

33:20.357 --> 33:21.608
Which French?

33:21.642 --> 33:22.492
36.

33:22.526 --> 33:25.028
Laveaux. Thank you, Dorn.

33:26.030 --> 33:28.147
Can you go faster, please?

33:28.165 --> 33:30.250
Is there something wrong?

33:30.284 --> 33:31.668
36 is angry.

33:31.702 --> 33:33.286
Who's 36?

33:33.320 --> 33:35.455
The Direction Regionale
de Police Judiciaire de Paris.

33:35.489 --> 33:37.373
We call it "36"

33:37.424 --> 33:39.158
because of their
headquarters' address,

33:39.176 --> 33:40.543
and they are very territorial.

33:40.594 --> 33:42.178
We have authorization, though.

33:42.213 --> 33:43.546
We do.

33:43.597 --> 33:46.599
But the team doesn't,
and they are in the park.

33:46.634 --> 33:48.468
What's going on?

33:48.502 --> 33:50.603
A young boy found
a dead dog up there.

33:50.638 --> 33:52.105
Oh?

33:52.139 --> 33:54.023
What sort of dog was it?

33:54.058 --> 33:55.642
Anne-Marie?

33:55.676 --> 33:56.842
Uh, sorry.

33:56.861 --> 33:59.062
We're almost done here.
Merci beaucoup.

34:12.877 --> 34:14.960
So this entire crime scene
can be reproduced now?

34:14.995 --> 34:16.629
In holographic form.

34:16.664 --> 34:17.964
That's unbelievable.

34:17.998 --> 34:20.699
We first used it
on a case in Sittensen,

34:20.717 --> 34:22.034
near Hamburg.

34:22.052 --> 34:24.387
Asian triads killed
a number of civilians

34:24.420 --> 34:26.339
in a Chinese restaurant,
a massacre.

34:26.373 --> 34:27.873
We were able to show the jury

34:27.891 --> 34:30.092
exactly where each of
the shooters had been standing,

34:30.143 --> 34:31.226
and who they actually killed.

34:31.262 --> 34:33.096
- That's an impressive toy.
- Yeah.

34:33.147 --> 34:34.514
We could even use it
to find any evidence

34:34.547 --> 34:36.065
missed the first time.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.650
Are you saying
we missed something?

34:37.685 --> 34:38.650
No, I meant...

34:38.686 --> 34:39.652
Who are you all?

34:39.687 --> 34:40.937
We're police officers with...

34:40.987 --> 34:43.106
- We're investigating a mur...
- Investigating?

34:43.157 --> 34:45.858
What the hell are three
foreign officers doing

34:45.891 --> 34:46.943
inside a Parisian crime scene?

34:46.994 --> 34:48.226
Well, it's kind of
hard to explain,

34:48.245 --> 34:49.579
but Major Daniel
will be on his way to...

34:49.612 --> 34:52.415
Good. He can come collect you
at headquarters.

34:52.449 --> 34:54.567
What?

34:54.585 --> 34:56.369
Will handcuffs be necessary?

35:14.188 --> 35:15.755
We're here.

35:15.773 --> 35:17.440
Go ahead in.
I need a minute.

35:18.943 --> 35:19.925
Alone.

35:19.944 --> 35:21.611
Okay.

35:21.645 --> 35:23.929
Probably take 'em a few minutes
to look it up, anyway.

35:23.948 --> 35:26.098
I just...
I just need a minute.

35:26.116 --> 35:28.267
No trouble.
Take your time.

35:58.399 --> 35:59.399
Hello?

35:59.433 --> 36:01.517
Anne-Marie?

36:05.072 --> 36:08.140
Anybody here?

36:24.425 --> 36:26.676
Ah!

36:28.462 --> 36:31.330
Anne-Marie!

36:34.301 --> 36:35.351
Anne-Marie!

36:35.386 --> 36:38.271
Anne-Marie!

36:42.897 --> 36:45.036
<i>Where's my phone?</i>

36:46.025 --> 36:48.525
Where's my phone?

36:50.496 --> 36:53.481
Come on! Come on!

36:55.534 --> 36:56.368
No!

36:58.204 --> 37:00.872
Paris emergency!

37:00.923 --> 37:02.507
Paris emergency...

37:02.541 --> 37:05.827
17! 17... 17.

37:05.845 --> 37:08.013
Keep it quiet.

37:09.164 --> 37:10.915
- Are these their phones?
- Yes, sir.

37:10.950 --> 37:12.500
Copy their contact names.

37:12.518 --> 37:13.618
How do you turn it on?

37:13.653 --> 37:15.020
I'd really rather you didn't.

37:15.054 --> 37:17.355
I didn't mean
Traveller Camps smell.

37:17.390 --> 37:18.356
Idiot.

37:18.391 --> 37:20.508
I only meant that
you living like that,

37:20.526 --> 37:22.677
living in a camp with
a lot of other families,

37:22.695 --> 37:24.229
you must've...

37:24.280 --> 37:25.530
Come across

37:25.564 --> 37:27.882
bad smells.

37:27.917 --> 37:29.818
Is this an apology?

37:29.852 --> 37:32.186
It's meant to be.

37:34.940 --> 37:36.024
You're an only child, right?

37:36.058 --> 37:38.476
Parents like yours,

37:38.511 --> 37:40.245
a solicitor and an MP,

37:40.296 --> 37:42.063
they don't go in
for a mess of kids.

37:42.098 --> 37:43.798
What's your point?

37:43.833 --> 37:45.250
You're a cliche.

37:45.301 --> 37:48.536
I'm proud I grew up Pavee.

37:48.554 --> 37:51.673
Four brothers and three sisters,

37:51.707 --> 37:53.425
and we didn't have Jack...

37:55.194 --> 37:57.262
But we had a family.

37:57.313 --> 38:00.732
No!
Don't press that button!

38:00.766 --> 38:02.216
I haven't downloaded
the images from the park yet.

38:02.234 --> 38:04.819
Images?
From my crime scene?

38:04.854 --> 38:05.854
Your crime scene?

38:05.888 --> 38:07.555
- Tommy.
- His crime scene?

38:07.573 --> 38:09.657
They missed the wounds
on the wrists and thighs...

38:09.692 --> 38:12.911
What? They missed
the blood spatters in the trees,

38:12.945 --> 38:14.279
and they missed the shoe!

38:14.330 --> 38:16.414
- Shoe?
- Major Daniel can explain.

38:16.449 --> 38:17.565
Major Daniel?

38:17.583 --> 38:19.534
He was supposed to keep me
informed. He didn't.

38:19.568 --> 38:20.785
You have every right
to be angry.

38:20.836 --> 38:23.922
I am deeply sorry
we've offended you.

38:23.956 --> 38:25.090
We should've asked
your permission

38:25.124 --> 38:26.875
before we entered
your jurisdiction,

38:26.909 --> 38:28.710
but it was an oversight,

38:28.744 --> 38:30.545
not an intentional slight.

38:32.131 --> 38:33.381
What shoe?

38:36.418 --> 38:38.887
If you removed evidence
from a crime scene,

38:38.921 --> 38:41.422
I'll have you all brought up
in front of a judge.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.607
You went through us

38:42.641 --> 38:44.258
like we was virgins
on our wedding night.

38:44.276 --> 38:46.094
Didja find any evidence?

38:46.112 --> 38:48.563
You put them in the cage?

38:48.597 --> 38:50.031
These foreigners
were trespassing.

38:50.066 --> 38:51.316
This is an order
from the I.C.C.,

38:51.367 --> 38:53.434
directing my team

38:53.452 --> 38:56.204
to investigate
a series of murders.

38:56.238 --> 38:57.455
So, now, Laveaux,

38:57.490 --> 38:59.324
you are interfering
in my investigation.

38:59.375 --> 39:00.542
Right?

39:00.576 --> 39:01.493
Open it.

39:01.544 --> 39:03.444
Hi, guys.

39:03.462 --> 39:05.780
I brought
identification and guns.

39:05.798 --> 39:06.447
There you go.

39:06.465 --> 39:07.632
Ah.

39:07.666 --> 39:08.783
Welcome home, girls.

39:08.801 --> 39:10.451
Talking of cliches.

39:10.469 --> 39:11.953
- Commissaire Laveaux?
- What?

39:11.971 --> 39:14.288
An American is reporting
a murdered man in a shoe store

39:14.306 --> 39:15.623
and an officer missing.

39:16.725 --> 39:18.126
- What shoe store?
- Charles Gallant.

39:23.132 --> 39:25.183
Hickman...

39:25.234 --> 39:26.267
Are you okay?

39:26.301 --> 39:30.905
You shouldn't have
brought me here, Louis.

39:30.940 --> 39:32.974
I wasn't...

39:32.992 --> 39:34.859
I'm not...
I'm not ready.

39:34.910 --> 39:36.861
I'm not <i>right.</i>

39:36.912 --> 39:37.862
What do you mean,
you're "not right"?

39:37.913 --> 39:39.831
The drugs, my head... I'm not...

39:39.865 --> 39:42.417
I'm not thinking clearly,
anymore!

39:42.451 --> 39:44.152
There's nothing wrong
with your head.

39:44.170 --> 39:45.537
Carl, listen to me.

39:45.588 --> 39:46.838
I was watching you,

39:46.872 --> 39:48.456
when you read that man
at the carnival.

39:48.490 --> 39:50.592
You even knew about
the mistress and the baby!

39:50.626 --> 39:52.510
I saw him! Okay?

39:52.545 --> 39:54.162
I saw him.
The day before.

39:54.180 --> 39:56.381
He was at the carnival with
the girl, with the girlfriend.

39:56.432 --> 39:57.999
And the baby!

39:58.017 --> 39:59.384
There was no reading involved,
there was no...

39:59.435 --> 40:01.102
no deduction or nothin'.

40:01.137 --> 40:05.673
I just... I saw him.

40:05.691 --> 40:08.176
I saw him.

40:16.735 --> 40:19.320
This is not your fault.

40:25.779 --> 40:30.783
I let her come in alone.

40:30.801 --> 40:34.787
I stayed in the car
for a few minutes.

40:34.805 --> 40:38.641
Because I had to do something.

40:38.675 --> 40:39.792
I let her come in alone.

40:42.062 --> 40:43.763
We have roadblocks

40:43.797 --> 40:46.131
on every major road
leaving Paris.

40:48.301 --> 40:51.737
We'll find her.

41:25.939 --> 41:30.309
Diplomatic plates.
U.S. Embassy.

41:32.062 --> 41:33.863
Let him through.

41:33.897 --> 41:37.300
Okay, this way.
This way. Move on.

41:50.982 --> 41:52.604
<i>I never should have done this.</i>

41:52.724 --> 41:54.127
<i>I wasn't ready.</i>

41:59.189 --> 42:01.524
<i>I let her go in by herself.</i>

42:03.493 --> 42:06.078
<i>I left her alone.</i>

42:06.113 --> 42:08.447
<i>I never should have done this.</i>

42:08.498 --> 42:11.400
<i>I never</i>
<i>should have done this...</i>

42:14.371 --> 42:18.574
There she is.

42:35.442 --> 42:38.144
<i>Bastardo.</i>

42:38.195 --> 42:39.428
You couldn't have known.

42:39.446 --> 42:40.596
No! I should've known.

42:40.614 --> 42:43.532
And if I were clear-headed,
I would have known!

42:43.567 --> 42:44.867
Carl, I need you.

42:44.901 --> 42:46.035
Why do you need

42:46.069 --> 42:48.571
a guy who lets his partner
walk into an ambush?

42:48.605 --> 42:50.573
What exactly am I...

42:50.607 --> 42:51.791
What am I giving to your team?

42:51.825 --> 42:53.125
So you're running away?

42:53.160 --> 42:54.961
Accepting my limitations
isn't running away.

42:54.995 --> 42:58.080
I'm not risking any more cops

42:58.114 --> 43:00.082
pretending that I can
still do the job again.

43:00.116 --> 43:01.467
You know what?

43:01.501 --> 43:03.469
When this is over,
I don't give a damn what you do,

43:03.503 --> 43:06.806
but I gave you the authority
to be a cop again,

43:06.840 --> 43:08.557
so do it!

43:08.592 --> 43:10.843
After, you can crawl
back to your carnival.

43:10.894 --> 43:12.011
I don't care,

43:12.062 --> 43:14.430
but this is your mess
to clean up!

43:18.568 --> 43:21.654
If we find this girl alive...

43:22.656 --> 43:23.939
I'm out.

43:23.973 --> 43:25.024
You understand?

43:29.979 --> 43:30.979
Fine.

43:34.951 --> 43:36.502
See what he does?

43:36.536 --> 43:38.170
Come here.

43:40.507 --> 43:42.625
He pushed the body
way back there,

43:42.659 --> 43:43.793
and then he goes to hide.

43:43.827 --> 43:45.895
So, when Anne-Marie
comes in,

43:45.929 --> 43:48.163
she's drawn towards the body?

43:51.468 --> 43:53.853
Then he grabs
the evidence bag with the shoe

43:53.887 --> 43:54.970
and doesn't even look at it.

43:55.004 --> 43:58.507
Like he already knew
what was in it.

43:58.525 --> 43:59.725
And who was coming.

43:59.776 --> 44:01.527
He did.

44:01.561 --> 44:03.446
He knew that shoe
was out there somewhere.

44:03.480 --> 44:05.197
We found tracks where
he was searching for it.

44:05.232 --> 44:08.067
He was there...

44:08.118 --> 44:09.568
Waiting for us
to find something,

44:09.619 --> 44:10.653
or the scene to open up.

44:10.687 --> 44:15.908
This guy is methodical,
thorough and smart.

44:15.959 --> 44:16.876
Smarter than us.

44:16.910 --> 44:18.077
You speak for yourself.

44:18.128 --> 44:19.462
I am.

44:19.496 --> 44:21.580
We have the customers' database.
It may be helpful.

44:21.631 --> 44:23.549
- Look for male names.
- Male?

44:23.583 --> 44:24.700
He may have seen us

44:24.735 --> 44:26.502
find the shoe...

44:28.555 --> 44:31.474
But how would he have known
that this is the store?

44:31.508 --> 44:32.308
This is the very store!

44:32.342 --> 44:36.979
Did he not show up here first?

44:37.013 --> 44:38.046
He bought them.

44:38.065 --> 44:40.182
Son of a bitch.

44:40.216 --> 44:42.685
My Scangen.

44:42.719 --> 44:44.904
If he was there
the whole time...

44:44.938 --> 44:46.889
I used the lasers at the scene.

44:46.907 --> 44:48.607
Are you saying you might have
a picture of him?

44:48.658 --> 44:51.694
Well, not a picture exactly,
but an image. It's possible.

44:51.728 --> 44:52.661
I need a face.

44:52.696 --> 44:54.747
Well... scanner's
at the crime squad.

44:54.781 --> 44:56.582
That's where we start.

45:06.543 --> 45:08.544
No... I tried!

45:08.578 --> 45:12.798
It's too fast!
Do you understand?

45:12.849 --> 45:15.267
No! I tried! I tried.

45:15.302 --> 45:18.086
I did! I did...

45:18.105 --> 45:20.106
I need time to think, okay?

45:20.140 --> 45:21.724
I just need
a little time to th...

45:26.279 --> 45:28.864
This is Gerald.

45:28.899 --> 45:30.883
Hi, yes, ma'am.

45:30.917 --> 45:32.818
No, no, no, no, no.

45:32.869 --> 45:34.820
Everything's completely
taken care of in Paris.

45:34.871 --> 45:37.223
Yes, you know I never
leave things half-completed.

45:37.257 --> 45:39.158
Of course. Of course.

45:39.209 --> 45:41.610
I always have
my cell phone with me.

45:41.628 --> 45:43.779
Yes, ma'am. I will.

45:43.797 --> 45:45.714
Thank you.

45:47.283 --> 45:49.635
Will I have my phone with me?

45:49.669 --> 45:51.921
Don't I always,
you ridiculous bitch?

45:53.223 --> 45:56.809
Have I ever, even once,

45:56.843 --> 45:59.628
not had my phone with me

45:59.646 --> 46:02.598
when you call, over and over?

46:02.632 --> 46:06.435
Yes! I have my phone!
I have my phone!

46:06.469 --> 46:08.637
- Where do we go?
- Upstairs.

46:08.655 --> 46:10.272
Eva, can you bring
the blue bag?

46:10.306 --> 46:11.657
Anything from the checkpoints?

46:11.691 --> 46:12.658
Nothing so far,

46:12.692 --> 46:14.577
but we'll keep them up
as long as it takes.

46:14.611 --> 46:16.579
Uh, you'll say this was
your operation, right?

46:18.448 --> 46:20.866
Yeah. It was
my responsibility.

46:23.453 --> 46:24.987
You do know the killer
must've gotten past

46:25.005 --> 46:26.505
any checkpoints by now.

46:26.540 --> 46:28.958
This guy can't stop
every route out of Paris.

46:28.992 --> 46:30.659
Yes. I know.

46:30.677 --> 46:33.679
He's keeping them up
to cover himself.

46:35.098 --> 46:36.832
Excuse me?

46:38.768 --> 46:39.718
Dorn?

46:39.769 --> 46:40.936
I'm in Paris.

46:40.971 --> 46:42.638
I need to speak with you.

46:42.672 --> 46:44.023
No, I can't.

46:44.057 --> 46:45.774
I didn't say it would be
nice to speak with you,

46:45.809 --> 46:47.443
I said I need to.

46:47.477 --> 46:49.361
About?

46:49.396 --> 46:50.512
Your son, Etienne.

46:50.530 --> 46:53.515
Okay.

46:53.533 --> 46:55.534
So the room back there's okay?

46:55.569 --> 46:56.869
To the left.

46:56.903 --> 46:58.621
Can I help you?

47:00.690 --> 47:01.657
Carl, I need to go somewhere.

47:01.691 --> 47:03.459
Meet with a source.

47:03.493 --> 47:05.360
Yeah. Yeah, I got this.

47:08.048 --> 47:10.382
Hickman.

47:10.417 --> 47:12.334
The crime scene photos.

47:12.368 --> 47:13.485
Paris.

47:13.520 --> 47:14.520
London.

47:14.554 --> 47:16.755
Rome. Dublin.
Every scene, every body.

47:16.806 --> 47:20.559
You're Scotland Yard, right?

47:20.594 --> 47:22.394
We call it The Met, but, yeah.

47:22.429 --> 47:23.762
You have access
to their databases?

47:23.813 --> 47:24.763
Yeah.

47:24.814 --> 47:26.381
We know
this guy is mobile, right?

47:26.399 --> 47:27.983
Four bodies,
four different countries.

47:28.018 --> 47:29.435
But what if the women missing

47:29.486 --> 47:31.103
aren't from the country
they were found in?

47:31.154 --> 47:33.489
What if the missing women
are from the previous one?

47:33.523 --> 47:34.740
You mean like
the girl we found in Paris

47:34.774 --> 47:36.909
could be from London?

47:36.943 --> 47:38.494
Yeah.

47:38.528 --> 47:40.395
Maybe your friends at the Yard

47:40.413 --> 47:42.948
could recheck our Paris girl...

47:42.999 --> 47:44.450
With missings
from the U.K.?

47:44.501 --> 47:46.401
Yeah. Yeah, that might work.

47:47.904 --> 47:49.922
Hang on, Anne-Marie.

48:03.019 --> 48:04.603
Okay. Okay...

48:04.638 --> 48:07.422
Okay, that happened.

48:07.440 --> 48:08.958
I need to think.

48:15.098 --> 48:16.448
This is what happens, Gerald.

48:16.483 --> 48:18.617
This is what happens
without control.

48:52.635 --> 48:54.687
I thought you'd be awake.

48:58.858 --> 49:01.076
Padma! Can you hold on a sec?

49:05.248 --> 49:07.583
Hi!

49:07.617 --> 49:09.451
Oh...

49:09.485 --> 49:10.836
That's sweet of you
to remember.

49:10.870 --> 49:15.040
Uh, no, actually,
I'm in Paris on a case.

49:15.091 --> 49:17.492
You know I don't really like
to celebrate anyway.

49:17.510 --> 49:20.929
Thanks, Padma.
I miss you, too.

49:20.964 --> 49:25.017
Cheers.
Thanks for the call.

49:32.108 --> 49:33.675
Okay, guys, it's ready.

49:33.693 --> 49:36.028
Here goes.

49:37.680 --> 49:39.514
Wow.

49:39.532 --> 49:40.816
That is
pretty impressive, Sebastian.

49:40.850 --> 49:42.684
In a more
controlled environment,

49:42.702 --> 49:45.187
we could even look for evidence
that was missed.

49:45.205 --> 49:47.522
Right, now what we need is
an image of one wanker.

49:47.540 --> 49:49.858
This guy would've gotten
as close as possible

49:49.876 --> 49:51.160
without attracting attention.

49:51.194 --> 49:53.662
Yeah. Outside the tape, right?
That's a good distance.

49:53.696 --> 49:57.132
Let me widen it out
to the limit of the scan.

50:10.180 --> 50:12.047
Okay, am I missing something?

50:12.065 --> 50:13.232
If you are, I am, too.

50:16.686 --> 50:19.104
What's that?

50:22.225 --> 50:23.609
Oh, that's the entrance
to the crime scene.

50:23.660 --> 50:24.693
Wasn't there a guard there?

50:24.727 --> 50:25.744
Let's have a closer look.

50:28.865 --> 50:29.998
Yeah. I remember him.

50:30.033 --> 50:31.917
- Young guy.
- And anyone trying...

50:31.951 --> 50:34.253
To get into the scene
would've had to talk to him.

50:34.287 --> 50:35.954
So this makes

50:36.005 --> 50:38.006
this guard potentially
our first eye-witness.

50:38.041 --> 50:39.842
Anne-Marie knew him.
His name was...

50:39.876 --> 50:40.926
Laffont.

50:42.629 --> 50:44.680
Cadet Antoine Laffont.

50:44.714 --> 50:47.099
All right,
well, I'll go and talk to him.

50:47.133 --> 50:49.218
I'll go with you.
We should stay paired up.

50:50.887 --> 50:52.688
I'm starting
to think we need to rely on

50:52.722 --> 50:54.056
the worst thing a cop
ever has to...

50:56.759 --> 50:58.260
Luck.

51:29.247 --> 51:31.135
- Bonsoir, monsieur.
- Bonsoir.

51:31.169 --> 51:32.136
Though I warn you,

51:32.171 --> 51:33.571
that is close to
the limit of my French.

51:33.605 --> 51:34.606
American?

51:34.640 --> 51:38.660
Guilty.
I'm with the diplomatic corps.

51:38.711 --> 51:40.662
This is an embassy vehicle.

51:40.713 --> 51:43.581
I see the plates.

51:43.615 --> 51:45.800
I had a flat I fixed,

51:45.834 --> 51:46.918
and I'm sort of in a hurry.

51:46.952 --> 51:49.137
Where'd the blood come from?

51:52.841 --> 51:54.175
This is so funny.

51:54.226 --> 51:55.176
I was, uh...

51:55.227 --> 51:57.795
I was tightening the bolts,

51:57.813 --> 52:01.799
and my hand slipped,
and I hit myself in the face.

52:01.817 --> 52:04.485
My nose is very sensitive.

52:04.520 --> 52:05.987
It bleeds very easily.

52:06.021 --> 52:08.072
See?

52:08.107 --> 52:10.491
I don't mean to be
disrespectful,

52:10.526 --> 52:13.244
but I really should be
getting back on the road.

52:19.835 --> 52:22.153
Merci.

52:29.561 --> 52:30.728
I'll help.

52:30.762 --> 52:32.563
No, no, no, no, no, no!

52:32.597 --> 52:34.315
I... it's...
As I said, it's fixed.

52:34.366 --> 52:36.099
Open the trunk.

52:36.117 --> 52:37.618
No! Um...

52:37.652 --> 52:40.437
I'd rather you put it
in the back seat.

52:40.455 --> 52:42.540
It will tear your leather.

52:42.574 --> 52:45.659
The... the ambassador's suitcases

52:45.710 --> 52:48.078
and personal items
are in that trunk.

52:48.112 --> 52:49.780
I cannot allow them
to be damaged.

52:49.814 --> 52:52.333
I would rather damage
these seats

52:52.367 --> 52:54.618
than the ambassador's
hat boxes.

52:54.652 --> 52:55.870
The rich cow...

52:55.921 --> 52:59.673
She would have me sacked
within the hour.

53:12.170 --> 53:13.187
Thank you so much, officer.

53:13.221 --> 53:14.638
That is very kind of you.

53:14.672 --> 53:17.141
<i>Merci. Merci beaucoup.</i>

53:17.175 --> 53:20.344
<i>- Bonsoir.</i>
<i>- Bonsoir.</i>

53:31.706 --> 53:34.158
He's a Russian.

53:34.192 --> 53:35.876
An ex-colonel of the army.

53:35.911 --> 53:39.663
Went underground
about 20 years ago...

53:39.697 --> 53:40.831
Took an armory

53:40.865 --> 53:44.385
and a cadre of very loyal
officers with him.

53:46.755 --> 53:47.922
Dimitrov.

53:47.973 --> 53:50.724
Alexander Dimitrov.

53:50.759 --> 53:52.559
You're sure?

53:52.594 --> 53:56.680
I have known my source
for a very long time...

53:56.714 --> 53:57.731
And they are sure.

53:57.766 --> 53:59.316
Do you trust them?

53:59.351 --> 54:02.486
Yes.

54:02.520 --> 54:04.605
But more than that, Louis...

54:04.656 --> 54:05.722
I trust fear,

54:05.740 --> 54:07.391
because, if there is anything
in this world

54:07.409 --> 54:08.909
that I know anything about,

54:08.944 --> 54:12.379
it's fear,

54:12.414 --> 54:14.498
and these people
fear that man,

54:14.532 --> 54:16.617
and they want him stopped
almost as much as you do.

54:16.668 --> 54:18.502
"Almost."

54:20.538 --> 54:25.342
I was able to obtain everything
you asked me to get for you,

54:25.377 --> 54:27.378
but I want you
to think about it.

54:27.412 --> 54:29.746
If you let me take
this envelope,

54:29.764 --> 54:32.299
unopened...

54:32.350 --> 54:34.718
I will use its contents

54:34.752 --> 54:38.889
to make him pay
for what he did to Etienne,

54:38.923 --> 54:40.891
for what he did to you
and Rebecca.

54:40.925 --> 54:43.310
I don't understand.

54:43.361 --> 54:44.478
I will find him

54:44.529 --> 54:47.264
and I will bring him to justice
in the courts.

54:47.282 --> 54:49.984
You've killed before,
but you won't kill him?

54:50.035 --> 54:51.568
Well, I've never
murdered anyone.

54:51.602 --> 54:52.569
It's not the same.

54:52.603 --> 54:54.771
So why unopened?

54:54.789 --> 54:59.827
Because it contains everything
you need to know to find him,

54:59.878 --> 55:02.296
and I will not
have you hunting for him

55:02.330 --> 55:04.281
while I am.

55:05.717 --> 55:07.918
I need to think about it.

55:12.724 --> 55:14.341
How is your case going?

55:14.392 --> 55:16.343
We'll get him.

55:16.394 --> 55:18.429
I have no doubt.

55:28.023 --> 55:31.308
Laffont gets off shift
in five minutes.

55:37.999 --> 55:38.815
Hold on.

55:42.937 --> 55:44.688
You know all that bollocks
I said earlier,

55:44.723 --> 55:47.007
about how great
havin' a big family is?

55:47.042 --> 55:48.926
That was bollocks, was it?

55:48.960 --> 55:51.678
My da...

55:53.565 --> 55:55.315
My da actually has
a hit out on me.

55:56.351 --> 55:57.317
A paid-for hit.

55:58.803 --> 55:59.937
You're serious?

55:59.971 --> 56:03.657
10,000 pounds.

56:03.691 --> 56:05.442
I don't even know
where he got 10,000 pounds.

56:05.476 --> 56:07.477
But he put it up

56:07.495 --> 56:09.446
when I joined
the police services.

56:09.480 --> 56:10.748
Now I'm a target

56:10.782 --> 56:12.533
for any Traveller
who might come across me.

56:12.584 --> 56:15.486
Your family wants you dead?

56:15.520 --> 56:18.372
Very.

56:18.423 --> 56:19.339
Why are you telling me this?

56:19.374 --> 56:23.377
Because, if we're to be...

56:23.411 --> 56:25.662
gonna be partnered,

56:25.680 --> 56:26.747
then...

56:26.781 --> 56:29.099
You should know
what you're dealing with.

56:30.535 --> 56:31.685
I guess I'm just saying

56:31.719 --> 56:34.838
that, you know, having
a great, big family's...

56:37.342 --> 56:40.761
Not always such a good thing.

56:46.451 --> 56:47.734
Here's our guy.

57:06.754 --> 57:07.721
<i>Go ahead.</i>

57:07.755 --> 57:09.056
I need a minute.

57:09.090 --> 57:10.591
No trouble. Take your time.

57:10.642 --> 57:12.926
Anne-Marie!

57:49.075 --> 57:50.108
Thanks.

57:50.143 --> 57:52.694
We'll let you know
as soon as we know more.

57:52.728 --> 57:54.780
- It's not her.
- Thank God.

57:54.831 --> 57:56.198
- The body in the woods...
- It's an overdose.

57:56.232 --> 57:57.232
A known local junkie.

57:58.401 --> 58:01.036
Let's go back to the beginning.

58:02.372 --> 58:03.755
I've been looking at
the crime scenes.

58:03.790 --> 58:05.707
They aren't exact matches,

58:05.741 --> 58:06.692
but look at that.

58:06.726 --> 58:08.377
Isn't everything
just a bit too similar?

58:08.411 --> 58:09.945
You mean staged?

58:09.979 --> 58:11.129
Chasing them
through the woods

58:11.180 --> 58:12.881
is part of his thing, right?

58:12.915 --> 58:14.349
The similarities
could be coincidence.

58:14.384 --> 58:15.851
I'm thinking
that he's recreating something.

58:15.885 --> 58:18.253
We all said that we thought
he was putting on a show.

58:18.271 --> 58:19.771
It's not a show.
It's a ritual.

58:19.806 --> 58:21.139
He doesn't hide the bodies.

58:21.190 --> 58:23.758
So if she's not found soon,
it's a good thing?

58:23.776 --> 58:25.277
She probably survived
the night.

58:25.311 --> 58:27.896
Which means he could
get back on script,

58:27.930 --> 58:29.731
back on ritual.

58:29.765 --> 58:32.234
Which means he will take her
to a capital city.

58:32.268 --> 58:36.154
Great. So, by tonight,
he could be anywhere from, uh...

58:36.205 --> 58:39.124
Oslo to Athens.

58:39.158 --> 58:41.209
All right.
Let me arrange something.

58:44.780 --> 58:46.448
He spoke to a lot of people,

58:46.466 --> 58:48.467
but can't remember any of them.

58:48.501 --> 58:49.968
Look at him.

58:50.002 --> 58:50.969
The way his eyes dart

58:51.003 --> 58:52.053
and his eyebrows are raised,

58:52.088 --> 58:54.089
his mouth, the corners
are pulled back.

58:54.123 --> 58:55.340
You see all that?

58:55.391 --> 58:56.892
He's afraid.

58:56.926 --> 58:58.460
You mean
like in "suspect" afraid?

58:58.478 --> 59:00.795
No.

59:00.813 --> 59:02.797
Laveaux bullies
all his officers.

59:02.815 --> 59:04.900
There has to be a way
to get him past that

59:04.934 --> 59:06.184
and remember.

59:06.235 --> 59:08.186
I could try something.

59:09.939 --> 59:12.240
I'm sorry. I've tried.

59:12.275 --> 59:14.993
I can't remember
any specific details.

59:15.027 --> 59:17.195
Nobody thinks
you haven't tried.

59:17.230 --> 59:18.413
Nobody thinks

59:18.448 --> 59:19.915
that you haven't told us

59:19.949 --> 59:21.783
everything
that you consciously know.

59:21.817 --> 59:23.985
Please... sit.

59:27.764 --> 59:31.510
You said "consciously"?

59:31.544 --> 59:33.795
Well, sometimes,

59:33.829 --> 59:35.163
attempting to retrieve a memory

59:35.181 --> 59:36.331
is almost impossible,

59:36.349 --> 59:39.000
in the traditional way.

59:39.018 --> 59:41.470
It could be because of trauma,

59:41.504 --> 59:43.288
it could be because of fear,

59:43.322 --> 59:45.753
or it could be

59:45.873 --> 59:48.527
because we're under so much
pressure to get it right,

59:48.561 --> 59:51.096
that we freeze up.

59:51.130 --> 59:52.397
But I've told you everything.

59:52.448 --> 59:53.448
Not everything.

59:53.483 --> 59:54.516
Yes.

59:54.534 --> 59:55.567
You haven't told me
if it was warm.

59:55.618 --> 59:57.986
Excuse me?

59:58.020 --> 59:59.371
Was it warm?

59:59.405 --> 01:00:00.906
How is it related to...?

01:00:00.957 --> 01:00:03.542
Just...

01:00:03.576 --> 01:00:04.826
tell me.

01:00:06.629 --> 01:00:08.580
I think it was around 24 or 25.

01:00:08.631 --> 01:00:10.832
No, no, no.

01:00:10.866 --> 01:00:13.351
Were you warm?

01:00:13.386 --> 01:00:16.471
Don't give me the fact,
give me the feeling.

01:00:16.506 --> 01:00:19.841
Yes, I was warm.

01:00:19.876 --> 01:00:23.061
Most of the day...

01:00:23.095 --> 01:00:24.379
It was cooler

01:00:24.397 --> 01:00:28.483
when the sun
went behind the clouds.

01:00:28.518 --> 01:00:31.219
Good.

01:00:31.237 --> 01:00:33.154
Now what do you smell?

01:00:34.524 --> 01:00:36.057
Leaves.

01:00:36.075 --> 01:00:37.275
Damp leaves.

01:00:37.326 --> 01:00:41.112
And they cut the grass
yesterday.

01:00:42.498 --> 01:00:45.617
Now, what do you hear?

01:00:47.453 --> 01:00:49.237
Antoine?

01:00:49.255 --> 01:00:51.223
What do you hear?

01:00:51.257 --> 01:00:52.574
It's what I don't hear.

01:00:52.608 --> 01:00:54.626
I'm sorry?

01:00:54.677 --> 01:00:58.363
There should be children
in a park.

01:00:58.397 --> 01:01:00.215
And there's no children?

01:01:00.249 --> 01:01:02.234
No.

01:01:02.268 --> 01:01:04.336
They can't play
because of the crime scene.

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:07.939
I hear the people complaining.

01:01:07.974 --> 01:01:10.442
People want their park back.

01:01:10.476 --> 01:01:12.227
And how does that
make you feel?

01:01:12.261 --> 01:01:14.479
I wish they could have
their picnics,

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:17.482
and play in the playgrounds
and walk their...

01:01:19.318 --> 01:01:20.652
What is it?

01:01:23.039 --> 01:01:23.938
There was a man...

01:01:23.956 --> 01:01:25.240
He had a dog.

01:01:25.274 --> 01:01:26.941
The dog!

01:01:26.959 --> 01:01:28.577
The dog?

01:01:28.611 --> 01:01:32.264
The dog that was dead later
in the park.

01:01:32.298 --> 01:01:33.915
He killed it!

01:01:33.949 --> 01:01:35.417
What do we know about this dog?

01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:36.384
There was a dead dog.

01:01:36.419 --> 01:01:38.970
We didn't know
that someone killed him.

01:01:39.005 --> 01:01:41.556
Eva, Sebastian, details.

01:01:41.591 --> 01:01:43.174
This man...

01:01:43.225 --> 01:01:45.126
Can you describe him?

01:01:48.731 --> 01:01:52.100
Only that he was very short.

01:01:53.319 --> 01:01:54.391
She's good.

01:01:54.511 --> 01:01:56.321
Yeah. You all are.

01:01:57.757 --> 01:01:59.541
If Anne-Marie were dead,

01:01:59.575 --> 01:02:01.910
she would have
been found by now.

01:02:01.928 --> 01:02:03.962
What does it mean for her?

01:02:05.598 --> 01:02:07.082
If he has somewhere to go...

01:02:08.635 --> 01:02:10.052
To be alone with her...

01:02:10.086 --> 01:02:13.255
To have time
to get his ritual back...

01:02:15.892 --> 01:02:21.947
<i>Then who and what she is</i>
<i>will mean less and less.</i>

01:02:21.981 --> 01:02:24.733
<i>She'll just become</i>
<i>another of his fantasies...</i>

01:02:28.121 --> 01:02:30.122
<i>Until tonight.</i>

01:02:33.635 --> 01:02:35.393
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:02:35.513 --> 01:02:37.419
Paris Animal Control collected
the dog corpse.

01:02:37.492 --> 01:02:38.801
It had a microchip in it,

01:02:38.828 --> 01:02:40.629
registered
to a local animal shelter.

01:02:40.663 --> 01:02:42.631
Eva and Sebastian
are headed there now.

01:02:42.665 --> 01:02:44.582
Antoine's description's
at all the checkpoints now,

01:02:44.616 --> 01:02:45.800
but I don't hold out much hope.

01:02:45.835 --> 01:02:48.270
The distinctive part
of the description is his height

01:02:48.304 --> 01:02:50.171
and he's gonna be in a car,
sitting down.

01:02:50.206 --> 01:02:51.789
The Met came through.

01:02:51.807 --> 01:02:53.391
They identified her?

01:02:53.426 --> 01:02:54.592
The girl found in Paris

01:02:54.626 --> 01:02:56.511
appears to be a missing
from southeast London,

01:02:56.562 --> 01:02:58.179
named Sasha Quinn.

01:02:58.230 --> 01:03:00.098
Same height, same hair color,

01:03:00.132 --> 01:03:01.099
and she was reported

01:03:01.133 --> 01:03:03.184
the very night
the Paris body was found.

01:03:03.235 --> 01:03:05.487
They're getting DNA information
from her parents,

01:03:05.521 --> 01:03:07.489
but they have to be
a bit sensitive,

01:03:07.523 --> 01:03:09.140
because, it seems,
she was an escort.

01:03:09.158 --> 01:03:10.775
Try the agency.

01:03:10.809 --> 01:03:13.828
They keep information
on their clients.

01:03:13.863 --> 01:03:15.530
I'm thinking...
Her being an escort

01:03:15.581 --> 01:03:17.165
makes the choice of shoe
even more peculiar.

01:03:17.199 --> 01:03:18.583
What do you mean?

01:03:18.617 --> 01:03:21.819
It's heavy. The heel is short,
it's vintage, unflattering.

01:03:21.837 --> 01:03:23.488
Not sexy enough?

01:03:23.506 --> 01:03:24.673
No, I wouldn't think so.

01:03:24.707 --> 01:03:26.591
If you don't want them sexy...

01:03:28.511 --> 01:03:31.496
Are you dressing them
completely?

01:03:44.777 --> 01:03:45.843
Where are we?

01:03:45.861 --> 01:03:48.179
In a lovely apartment

01:03:48.197 --> 01:03:51.182
the diplomatic corps keeps
for advanced workers.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.683
Diplomatic?

01:03:52.702 --> 01:03:54.369
It's very cozy...

01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:58.523
It's very private.

01:03:58.541 --> 01:03:59.857
Discreet.

01:04:05.915 --> 01:04:07.916
I'm an officer of
the French National Police.

01:04:07.967 --> 01:04:10.502
If you let me go, I...

01:04:10.536 --> 01:04:11.702
I will speak to the magistrate

01:04:11.721 --> 01:04:13.304
and I will tell him
you were very compassionate.

01:04:13.339 --> 01:04:15.173
You know, I'd normally
let you do this yourself,

01:04:15.207 --> 01:04:16.808
but this is all very different,
isn't it?

01:04:16.842 --> 01:04:19.344
There's still a chance for you!

01:04:19.378 --> 01:04:21.596
Completely different.

01:04:21.647 --> 01:04:22.931
I don't mean anything untoward,

01:04:22.982 --> 01:04:24.482
but...

01:04:24.517 --> 01:04:25.850
But it's time.

01:04:27.937 --> 01:04:28.903
Time?

01:04:28.938 --> 01:04:31.439
Time to change.

01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:34.492
Okay. So we have a name
and we may have a picture.

01:04:34.527 --> 01:04:38.913
The dog was adopted yesterday by
<i>a man called "John Smith."</i>

01:04:38.948 --> 01:04:40.865
It's about as anonymous a name
as you could use...

01:04:40.899 --> 01:04:42.500
- But in America.
- Yeah, Britain, too.

01:04:42.535 --> 01:04:45.537
Yeah, but they have
CCTV cameras here.

01:04:45.571 --> 01:04:46.788
I think I've got him!

01:04:46.839 --> 01:04:48.706
Do you have him?

01:04:56.465 --> 01:04:57.748
Sending now.

01:05:01.604 --> 01:05:02.854
Got you.

01:05:02.888 --> 01:05:04.556
Get that face
to every cop in Europe.

01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:06.257
I want it on P.D.A.'s,

01:05:06.275 --> 01:05:08.810
cell phones,
any device anyone might have.

01:05:08.861 --> 01:05:10.979
I want to know who he is.

01:05:20.156 --> 01:05:21.907
I didn't want
to do it this way, but...

01:05:24.794 --> 01:05:26.161
No!

01:05:26.212 --> 01:05:27.996
There's still a chance... there's
still a chance to do it right!

01:05:28.116 --> 01:05:29.014
I really wish
you'd cooperate.

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:30.281
No, no, no, no, no!

01:05:39.291 --> 01:05:42.978
The escort agency says
Sasha's last client was a man

01:05:43.012 --> 01:05:44.179
named...

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:45.847
John Smith.
So he's British?

01:05:45.898 --> 01:05:47.766
Well, not necessarily.
They also said

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:50.301
that she only handled
international clients.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.853
I just hung up with Interpol.

01:05:51.904 --> 01:05:53.271
Tell me you have his name?

01:05:53.305 --> 01:05:56.474
And it's been verified
through another agency.

01:05:56.492 --> 01:05:58.443
- Which agency?
- The State Department.

01:05:58.477 --> 01:06:00.078
His name is Gerald Wilhoit.

01:06:00.113 --> 01:06:03.115
He's a traveling
advance secretary

01:06:03.149 --> 01:06:05.367
from the U.S. Diplomatic Corps.

01:06:05.418 --> 01:06:07.318
That's how
he got around so easily.

01:06:07.337 --> 01:06:09.454
And why nobody
stopped him at any checkpoints.

01:06:09.488 --> 01:06:11.456
He's an American?

01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:12.824
With diplomatic immunity.

01:06:12.842 --> 01:06:15.010
We have a hit on the photo!
Highway patrol.

01:06:15.044 --> 01:06:16.545
A gendarme pulled over
to assist a motorist

01:06:16.596 --> 01:06:18.964
with a flat tire
in the middle of the night.

01:06:18.998 --> 01:06:21.099
He says he's sure from the photo
it's our guy.

01:06:21.134 --> 01:06:23.001
Where?

01:06:23.019 --> 01:06:24.970
E50, 25 kilometers
outside Metz,

01:06:25.004 --> 01:06:26.321
heading east.

01:06:26.356 --> 01:06:28.840
- He's going to Germany?
- He's taken her to Berlin.

01:06:49.782 --> 01:06:52.156
_

01:06:53.317 --> 01:06:57.323
_

01:06:59.254 --> 01:07:00.254
You don't keep one in the pipe?

01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:03.040
Had them jam
too much that way.

01:07:03.074 --> 01:07:05.927
I'll take my chances with
a piece that's ready to go.

01:07:05.961 --> 01:07:07.211
Hmm.

01:07:07.245 --> 01:07:08.679
Wouldn't need to,
if you were fast.

01:07:08.977 --> 01:07:11.732
_

01:07:18.857 --> 01:07:21.192
Do you even have a gun?

01:07:21.226 --> 01:07:22.727
Never really needed one.

01:07:22.761 --> 01:07:23.761
Brits.

01:07:23.779 --> 01:07:25.780
<i>Danke.</i>

01:07:25.814 --> 01:07:28.282
GSG9 is gonna meet us
wherever we say.

01:07:28.317 --> 01:07:29.283
GSG9?

01:07:29.318 --> 01:07:30.601
You say "SWAT."

01:07:30.619 --> 01:07:32.937
Tell me about
the parks in Berlin.

01:07:32.955 --> 01:07:34.655
There are several large ones.

01:07:34.706 --> 01:07:36.324
Remember the scene,
remember the bad guy.

01:07:36.375 --> 01:07:38.876
We're looking
for a wooded area.

01:07:38.911 --> 01:07:41.712
Busy during the day,
but not at all at night.

01:07:41.747 --> 01:07:42.880
Somewhere near
the center of the city.

01:07:42.915 --> 01:07:45.282
Tiergarten's
the right kind of park.

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:49.337
But there's also
Volkspark Friedrichshain.

01:07:49.388 --> 01:07:50.888
Sebastian, we don't
have time to be wrong.

01:07:50.923 --> 01:07:52.590
Which park is it?

01:07:52.624 --> 01:07:55.760
Tiergarten or Volkspark?
Which one?

01:08:00.649 --> 01:08:02.233
Tiergarten.

01:08:05.303 --> 01:08:07.104
All right.
Be cautious with Wilhoit.

01:08:07.138 --> 01:08:08.823
He's not only dangerous,

01:08:08.857 --> 01:08:10.741
he has diplomatic immunity.

01:08:10.776 --> 01:08:12.109
So, if you find him,

01:08:12.143 --> 01:08:14.144
make sure Detective Hickman
gets over there,

01:08:14.163 --> 01:08:15.163
unless you want him

01:08:15.197 --> 01:08:16.948
to have grounds
for beating his arrest.

01:08:27.009 --> 01:08:27.992
Stay in your grid.

01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:29.326
Stay in contact.

01:08:29.344 --> 01:08:31.161
Be ready on my signal.
All right?

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.965
We move out in two minutes.

01:08:33.999 --> 01:08:35.383
Do you know how to use this?

01:08:35.434 --> 01:08:37.835
I said I never needed one,

01:08:37.853 --> 01:08:38.886
not that I didn't know how.

01:08:40.671 --> 01:08:41.939
Who's Padma?

01:08:44.009 --> 01:08:45.009
It's your birthday, right?

01:08:45.027 --> 01:08:47.812
She called you
for your birthday?

01:08:47.845 --> 01:08:50.314
She's my nanny.

01:08:50.348 --> 01:08:53.651
She always calls me
for my birthday.

01:08:53.685 --> 01:08:54.986
But your parents haven't.

01:08:56.688 --> 01:08:58.022
I've been with you
for the last two days.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.857
No one else called.

01:08:59.875 --> 01:09:02.910
Well, they're...
very busy.

01:09:02.961 --> 01:09:04.962
They're important people
with important jobs.

01:09:04.997 --> 01:09:06.796
Sienna.
We don't make a big deal...

01:09:06.832 --> 01:09:07.999
of birthdays
in my family anyway.

01:09:08.033 --> 01:09:09.366
Sienna!

01:09:09.384 --> 01:09:11.085
All I'm saying is,

01:09:11.136 --> 01:09:13.703
it doesn't matter
that they haven't called.

01:09:13.721 --> 01:09:15.805
All our families
are messed up.

01:09:15.841 --> 01:09:19.209
All I'm trying to say is...

01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:21.211
cheers.

01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:23.898
Cheers, and...

01:09:23.932 --> 01:09:26.367
Happy Birthday.

01:09:40.916 --> 01:09:43.451
Remember what I said
outside the morgue?

01:09:43.502 --> 01:09:45.703
Take deeper breaths?

01:09:48.073 --> 01:09:51.075
I said,
"We'll finish this... later."

01:09:51.093 --> 01:09:53.844
Yes, ma'am, inspector Pride.

01:09:53.879 --> 01:09:55.463
We'll finish this later.

01:09:59.051 --> 01:10:00.885
Come on! Let's go!

01:10:11.363 --> 01:10:13.447
Don't move,
or it'll be too deep.

01:10:20.438 --> 01:10:22.790
It's all over, it's done.

01:10:22.824 --> 01:10:24.792
What... what's done?

01:10:24.826 --> 01:10:26.243
You're dying.

01:10:26.277 --> 01:10:29.330
No!

01:10:31.917 --> 01:10:33.467
You have one chance.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.387
Run.

01:10:43.243 --> 01:10:45.261
Run!

01:10:46.746 --> 01:10:48.197
<i>Son of a bitch hunted her.</i>

01:10:48.215 --> 01:10:49.965
Run!

01:10:52.385 --> 01:10:55.254
<i>She was dead the moment</i>
<i>she showed him fear.</i>

01:11:05.515 --> 01:11:06.715
No.

01:11:06.733 --> 01:11:09.051
What did you say?

01:11:10.604 --> 01:11:12.247
I said run!

01:11:12.367 --> 01:11:13.280
No.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.608
I'll kill you right here!

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.519
I'm not afraid of you.

01:11:18.639 --> 01:11:20.715
- Run!
- No!

01:11:22.032 --> 01:11:23.666
Ah!

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.584
Run, you bitch!

01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:34.627
No.

01:11:34.678 --> 01:11:36.512
I am in charge here!

01:11:36.546 --> 01:11:40.015
Who am I supposed to be,
Gerald? Huh?

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:42.968
Who did you think
you were talking to,

01:11:43.019 --> 01:11:45.970
when you were alone
in the front seat, Gerald?

01:11:48.141 --> 01:11:49.558
Run!

01:11:50.944 --> 01:11:54.510
<i>He seems to have some sort</i>
<i>of ritual that plays out...</i>

01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:56.480
<i>before the murder.</i>

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:58.750
No! It's all a fantasy...

01:11:58.801 --> 01:12:01.336
The park, the...
the hunting!

01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:03.305
<i>He didn't just conceal</i>
<i>their identities,</i>

01:12:03.339 --> 01:12:05.841
<i>he erased them.</i>

01:12:05.875 --> 01:12:09.394
You dressed me up! Who am I?
Who am I supposed to be?

01:12:09.428 --> 01:12:11.379
- Run!
- No!

01:12:11.397 --> 01:12:12.848
- Run!
- No!

01:12:12.882 --> 01:12:14.099
- You bitch.
- No!

01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:15.817
You do what I say. Yes!

01:12:15.852 --> 01:12:20.689
You do it,
and you do it now! Okay? Run!

01:12:22.275 --> 01:12:25.610
<i>It's odd, it's actually</i>
<i>a very old style.</i>

01:12:25.661 --> 01:12:27.195
Gerald...

01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:28.363
Gerald, please.

01:12:28.397 --> 01:12:29.331
Is it your mother?

01:12:30.917 --> 01:12:31.900
Is it your mother?

01:12:31.918 --> 01:12:33.835
The older shoes,
the older dress?

01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:36.705
I'm not your mother!

01:12:36.739 --> 01:12:39.925
I'm a detective
in the French National Police.

01:12:39.959 --> 01:12:42.627
You've taken a police officer.

01:12:42.678 --> 01:12:44.296
Anne-Marie!

01:12:46.632 --> 01:12:48.183
Gerald, they know
who you are.

01:12:48.217 --> 01:12:50.051
- Who?
- The police.

01:12:50.085 --> 01:12:51.520
Anne-Marie!

01:12:53.065 --> 01:12:54.602
I am Detective San.

01:12:54.722 --> 01:12:55.689
You are sick,

01:12:55.723 --> 01:12:57.674
and I can help you,
and I can...

01:12:59.611 --> 01:13:00.894
I am not sick!

01:13:00.945 --> 01:13:04.364
You filthy bitch!

01:13:05.850 --> 01:13:07.851
Anne-Marie!

01:13:07.869 --> 01:13:09.486
Over here!

01:13:10.688 --> 01:13:13.373
Anne-Marie!

01:13:13.408 --> 01:13:15.358
Are you okay?

01:13:15.376 --> 01:13:17.578
- Get her up! Get her up!
- She's bleeding!

01:13:17.629 --> 01:13:20.547
- Medic! Medic!
- Over here!

01:13:20.582 --> 01:13:21.965
I wouldn't run.
I wouldn't show fear.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.501
You did good.
You did really good.

01:13:24.535 --> 01:13:26.470
You got her? Hold her!

01:13:26.504 --> 01:13:29.339
- Come on, get her.
- Over here.

01:13:31.509 --> 01:13:33.108
Give me your gun.

01:13:33.794 --> 01:13:35.498
Give me your gun.

01:13:38.451 --> 01:13:39.951
- Hickman.
- What?

01:13:41.821 --> 01:13:42.704
Do you need this?

01:13:42.755 --> 01:13:46.823
No... no!

01:14:31.804 --> 01:14:33.171
Careful with that little thing.

01:14:33.205 --> 01:14:34.973
It might raise
a nasty bruise on me.

01:14:35.007 --> 01:14:36.842
It's your gun.

01:14:36.876 --> 01:14:38.260
You kind of look cute
with it, though.

01:14:39.645 --> 01:14:41.913
<i>Tommy, come in.</i>
<i>We have Anne-Marie.</i>

01:14:41.948 --> 01:14:44.182
<i>Repeat. We have Anne-Marie.</i>
<i>She's safe.</i>

01:14:44.216 --> 01:14:45.183
She's alive!

01:14:45.217 --> 01:14:46.234
Sienna!

01:14:51.407 --> 01:14:54.058
Sorry.

01:14:54.076 --> 01:14:57.329
Didn't see him...
I didn't see him...

01:14:57.363 --> 01:15:02.033
Officer down! Officer down!
Help me now!

01:15:06.422 --> 01:15:07.789
Anne-Marie...

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.257
She's fine, she's fine.

01:15:09.292 --> 01:15:11.743
She's safe.
She's safe.

01:15:11.761 --> 01:15:14.012
Help me!

01:15:15.748 --> 01:15:18.016
We did good.
We did good.

01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:21.436
Shh, don't talk now.
Just shush. You'll be fine.

01:15:22.855 --> 01:15:26.308
Tell them...
I did good?

01:15:26.359 --> 01:15:30.278
You did so good.
You did amazing.

01:15:30.313 --> 01:15:31.980
No, no, no, no, no!

01:15:32.031 --> 01:15:34.983
No. Wait, wait, wait!

01:15:35.034 --> 01:15:35.984
Sienna!

01:15:36.035 --> 01:15:37.652
Tommy!

01:15:37.703 --> 01:15:39.871
He stabbed her!
He came from nowhere.

01:15:39.906 --> 01:15:43.074
I couldn't do anything!

01:15:43.108 --> 01:15:44.125
Where did he go?

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.877
Tommy! Where did he go?

01:15:45.912 --> 01:15:48.713
That way!
He went that way!

01:15:48.748 --> 01:15:50.448
- Stay here.
- I'm gonna kill him!

01:15:50.466 --> 01:15:53.919
Do not leave her alone!

01:15:58.341 --> 01:16:02.093
Sienna... Sienna! Sienna?

01:16:11.153 --> 01:16:12.938
Anne Wilhoit.

01:16:12.972 --> 01:16:16.107
Found 28 years ago
in Central Park.

01:16:16.141 --> 01:16:17.809
Someone chased her

01:16:17.827 --> 01:16:19.578
and stabbed her
over a hundred times.

01:16:19.612 --> 01:16:20.829
You don't know
anything about her.

01:16:20.863 --> 01:16:22.197
They could never
prove it was you.

01:16:22.248 --> 01:16:24.249
You were the prime suspect,
they just couldn't close it.

01:16:24.283 --> 01:16:25.951
Why would I kill my mother?

01:16:25.985 --> 01:16:27.986
Why do guys like you
ever kill their mothers?

01:16:28.004 --> 01:16:29.120
She belittled you

01:16:29.154 --> 01:16:31.206
and made you clean your room,
do your homework.

01:16:31.257 --> 01:16:33.091
You're done now.
Don't move your hands.

01:16:33.125 --> 01:16:36.127
I'm a member of the United
States Diplomatic Corps.

01:16:36.162 --> 01:16:37.996
Put your hands
on top of your head.

01:16:38.014 --> 01:16:39.831
I have immunity!
I demand to see...

01:16:39.849 --> 01:16:41.716
- the ambassador!
- Put you hands on top of your head!

01:16:47.306 --> 01:16:48.523
You don't keep one in the pipe?

01:16:48.557 --> 01:16:50.692
They jam too much that way.

01:16:54.647 --> 01:16:57.115
I saw you in the Paris park!

01:16:57.149 --> 01:16:59.017
You're a cripple, aren't you?

01:17:00.352 --> 01:17:01.352
Damn!

01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:04.789
She liked to be called "Annie,"
not Anne.

01:17:04.824 --> 01:17:07.158
I hated that.

01:17:07.192 --> 01:17:10.045
What kind of mother
calls herself "Annie"?

01:17:10.079 --> 01:17:12.080
It's so inappropriate.

01:17:12.131 --> 01:17:13.248
Sometimes,

01:17:13.299 --> 01:17:15.917
even killing someone
doesn't shut them up.

01:17:15.968 --> 01:17:18.920
You say hello to her
for me, would ya?

01:17:31.383 --> 01:17:34.352
Let me take it.

01:17:38.157 --> 01:17:39.991
I took the shot.

01:17:40.026 --> 01:17:42.060
I took the shot.

01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:57.092
Anne-Marie, we'll
come by the hospital

01:17:57.126 --> 01:17:58.093
when we finish here.

01:17:58.127 --> 01:18:00.378
Thank you, major.

01:18:00.412 --> 01:18:03.131
I told you before,
call me Louis.

01:18:09.421 --> 01:18:10.939
Did you know
he was an American?

01:18:12.591 --> 01:18:16.427
Is that why you needed me?

01:18:16.445 --> 01:18:19.147
To avoid
the international incident?

01:18:19.198 --> 01:18:24.652
Only one person in the world
could've figured it out.

01:18:29.041 --> 01:18:30.241
Thank you.

01:18:34.997 --> 01:18:37.716
Hickman?

01:18:39.835 --> 01:18:41.503
Hickman!

01:18:43.055 --> 01:18:44.255
Would you come with me?

01:18:47.093 --> 01:18:49.060
Absolutely.

01:20:06.055 --> 01:20:08.539
George said you were back.

01:20:08.557 --> 01:20:12.510
Please. Please.
Come in.

01:20:14.513 --> 01:20:17.816
Sorry about the mess.

01:20:17.850 --> 01:20:20.768
Listen. The man
you asked me about?

01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:21.986
Phillip Genovese?

01:20:22.021 --> 01:20:23.488
Yeah?

01:20:23.522 --> 01:20:24.823
He's back, too.

01:20:24.857 --> 01:20:27.358
Did he have any kids with him?

01:20:27.392 --> 01:20:29.694
I didn't see any.
Not this time.

01:20:31.997 --> 01:20:34.332
Is he staying
in the same trailer?

01:20:34.366 --> 01:20:35.900
Always.

01:20:39.839 --> 01:20:41.339
Did he do this to you?

01:20:43.042 --> 01:20:44.575
Is he the one from New York?

01:20:44.593 --> 01:20:46.344
The one you were chasing?

01:20:50.299 --> 01:20:51.933
I knew a man
like you doesn't just

01:20:51.967 --> 01:20:53.885
show up one day
to clean garbage.

01:20:53.919 --> 01:20:55.520
A man like me?

01:20:55.554 --> 01:20:57.105
A man of substance.

01:21:00.276 --> 01:21:01.809
Cleaning up garbage

01:21:01.861 --> 01:21:02.810
is something
I've always been good at.

01:21:02.862 --> 01:21:05.263
Garbage like Genovese?

01:21:05.281 --> 01:21:07.815
Just like that.

01:21:09.935 --> 01:21:11.569
Are you going to
kill him for it?

01:21:13.455 --> 01:21:14.873
No. Not for this.

01:21:17.743 --> 01:21:18.743
I never thanked you properly

01:21:18.777 --> 01:21:21.445
for coming to my defense
the other day.

01:21:21.463 --> 01:21:24.549
Not necessary.

01:21:27.253 --> 01:21:28.887
Are you sure?

01:21:42.467 --> 01:21:43.985
I'm sure.

01:21:46.906 --> 01:21:49.691
Story of my life.

01:22:16.619 --> 01:22:19.004
I'm not going to feed you.

01:22:19.038 --> 01:22:20.172
It's against the law here.

01:22:20.206 --> 01:22:23.041
Those upon who you depended
for sustenance

01:22:23.075 --> 01:22:24.343
have turned against you

01:22:24.377 --> 01:22:27.929
and deemed you a toxic blight
upon society.

01:22:29.298 --> 01:22:31.383
And that means empty bellies
for you chaps.

01:22:36.055 --> 01:22:38.056
You're talking philosophy
to pigeons.

01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:39.369
And they don't listen.

01:22:39.489 --> 01:22:44.146
Well, I'm beginning to know
how that feels.

01:22:45.314 --> 01:22:47.349
I'm sorry about
Inspector Pride.

01:22:47.383 --> 01:22:51.203
Thank you.

01:22:51.237 --> 01:22:54.539
They're not
very subtle, your team.

01:22:54.574 --> 01:22:56.208
Pictures, headlines...

01:22:56.242 --> 01:22:57.459
Everything, everywhere.

01:22:59.779 --> 01:23:01.797
An American diplomat

01:23:01.831 --> 01:23:05.417
shot and killed by
a former American policeman.

01:23:05.451 --> 01:23:06.785
Lucky you had him with you.

01:23:06.803 --> 01:23:09.588
Lucky. Yes. Very.

01:23:09.622 --> 01:23:12.152
You think of everything,
don't you, Louis?

01:23:22.097 --> 01:23:23.298
It's unopened.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.016
I can see that.

01:23:27.757 --> 01:23:29.658
You asked me about Rebecca.

01:23:32.278 --> 01:23:35.146
She's not good, you know.

01:23:39.419 --> 01:23:42.120
We may never be...

01:23:42.154 --> 01:23:43.338
I'm sorry.

01:23:43.372 --> 01:23:45.006
Go home, Louis.

01:23:45.041 --> 01:23:47.125
Be with her.

01:23:47.159 --> 01:23:49.159
Be together.

01:23:58.855 --> 01:24:00.722
You still here?

01:24:00.773 --> 01:24:04.175
So much for the wise words
of an old man.

01:24:05.311 --> 01:24:08.179
Well, maybe some old lady
will come by and feed you.

01:24:08.197 --> 01:24:10.515
Me...

01:24:10.533 --> 01:24:13.401
I have no bread.
