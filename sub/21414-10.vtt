00:06.836 --> 00:09.002
( theme music playing )

00:32.544 --> 00:34.627
( clattering )

00:35.918 --> 00:37.836
Man:
It's dusty.

00:41.085 --> 00:43.460
Just hot air.

00:44.794 --> 00:46.168
What?

00:47.252 --> 00:49.002
You okay?

00:50.377 --> 00:52.377
Yeah.
What time is it?

00:53.836 --> 00:55.502
9:40.

00:57.419 --> 00:58.836
Are you thirsty?

01:00.085 --> 01:01.836
( sizzles )

01:06.085 --> 01:08.544
We shouldn't have stopped.
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

01:10.377 --> 01:13.043
Like I said,
I just always thought
I'd go there someday,

01:13.043 --> 01:15.586
so it seemed like
maybe a...

01:15.586 --> 01:17.210
It's okay.

01:18.377 --> 01:20.210
We have time.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.335
You have the phone ready?

01:25.377 --> 01:29.085
My dad and I
used to go to games
at Lambeau when I was little.

01:30.544 --> 01:31.877
You know,
the Packers are the only

01:31.877 --> 01:34.252
community-owned team
in the NFL.

01:35.794 --> 01:37.168
Well, the owner
of the Padres

01:37.168 --> 01:38.627
tried to
donate the team

01:38.627 --> 01:40.460
to the city of San Diego
in 1984,

01:40.460 --> 01:43.002
but the league
wouldn't allow it.

01:43.002 --> 01:46.252
The system
prevented it.

01:47.544 --> 01:49.419
You have the phone ready?

01:49.419 --> 01:52.210
Yeah, I gave it
60 seconds before it goes,

01:52.210 --> 01:54.085
you know,
after the call arms it.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.586
Hey, um,
mind if I come in?

02:07.586 --> 02:09.669
- Come in?
- Yeah.

02:09.669 --> 02:12.294
Yeah, no,
I'm working.

02:12.294 --> 02:15.669
Maybe take a break
just for a minute.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.502
We don't have
a minute.

02:17.502 --> 02:20.127
- You said we have time.
- Not if we take a break.

02:21.627 --> 02:23.335
- I'm coming in.
- No!

02:23.335 --> 02:25.960
- Oh, Jesus, be careful!
- Look, it'll relax me, okay?

02:25.960 --> 02:27.460
Just...

02:31.794 --> 02:33.127
Get out.

02:36.502 --> 02:38.627
Do you know
how delicate this is?

02:38.627 --> 02:40.794
Of course.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.669
You wanna
get us both killed?

02:42.669 --> 02:44.419
Look,
I'll be careful.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.002
( zipper zipping )

02:52.918 --> 02:54.127
( sighs )

02:54.127 --> 02:56.460
It's even hotter
in here.

02:57.794 --> 03:00.377
Sorry I couldn't get
the AC going.

03:04.168 --> 03:06.460
So what do we do
with the tent?

03:06.460 --> 03:08.043
I mean,
when we're done.

03:08.043 --> 03:10.669
- Burn it?
- Why would we burn it?

03:10.669 --> 03:12.502
DNA.
Evidence.

03:12.502 --> 03:14.836
That's why we're
in here, right?

03:14.836 --> 03:18.002
- A tent can be washed.
- Right.

03:19.127 --> 03:20.627
What if they
check the bag, you know,

03:20.627 --> 03:22.335
before we get
to the sot?

03:23.502 --> 03:26.294
- Stick to the story.
- Right.

03:26.294 --> 03:28.085
- Short and simple.
- Right.

03:28.085 --> 03:31.377
- Two sentences,
remember?
- Yes.

03:31.377 --> 03:34.043
You'll be fine.

03:37.252 --> 03:38.586
What's your name?

03:41.294 --> 03:42.877
Sorry.

03:42.877 --> 03:44.377
I just...
( sighs )

03:44.377 --> 03:46.711
I mean, at this point,
what does it matter?

03:55.794 --> 03:57.711
Tell me
about the Packers.

03:57.711 --> 04:00.168
First game
you went to.

04:00.168 --> 04:02.544
Oh, you don't have to
Jedi mind trick me.

04:02.544 --> 04:04.210
I'm fine.

04:12.711 --> 04:13.918
I was eight.

04:16.419 --> 04:17.918
And I didn't realize it then,
but historically,

04:17.918 --> 04:19.918
it was a really
significant game.

04:19.918 --> 04:22.586
Have you ever heard
of the Lambeau Leap?

04:24.918 --> 04:28.627
R-Reggie White recovered
a fumble from the Raiders

04:28.627 --> 04:31.752
and he lateraled it
to LeRoy Butler

04:31.752 --> 04:35.085
who took it in 25 yards
for the touchdown.

04:36.502 --> 04:39.586
And to celebrate, he jumped
into the first row of stands

04:39.586 --> 04:42.252
and a bunch
of the fans,

04:42.252 --> 04:44.877
I mean, old men,
grown men,

04:44.877 --> 04:47.877
they just hugged him
and patted him on the back.

04:49.127 --> 04:51.210
The Lambeau Leap.

04:54.960 --> 04:59.294
( chuckles ) Probably
the first time any of them
had ever touched a black man...

05:01.252 --> 05:03.252
my dad included.

05:09.752 --> 05:11.460
What if
he doesn't win?

05:16.960 --> 05:18.794
I'm gonna throw up.

05:24.002 --> 05:26.419
( vomiting )

05:29.377 --> 05:31.168
Drink some water.

05:31.168 --> 05:32.960
I'm almost done.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.627
( toilet flushes )

05:40.460 --> 05:42.043
You okay?

05:44.419 --> 05:46.002
Mind if I
turn on the TV?

05:47.294 --> 05:50.335
If it makes you
feel better, go ahead.

05:50.335 --> 05:52.294
( TV turns on )

05:52.294 --> 05:55.168
Reporter:
...our correspondent is live
at the convention center...

05:55.168 --> 05:57.294
( scoffs )

05:57.294 --> 05:59.043
Really?

05:59.043 --> 06:00.335
Reporter:
There's a big crowd...

06:00.335 --> 06:01.836
You can't do better
than this?

06:01.836 --> 06:03.669
( crowd cheering )

06:12.252 --> 06:13.836
( sighs )

06:17.168 --> 06:18.960
You getting dressed?

06:18.960 --> 06:22.419
You might wanna shower first.
It's like a swamp in here.

06:25.544 --> 06:28.794
Reporter #2: Gonna be a wild one
down there tonight as Smith
works the delegates...

06:28.794 --> 06:33.294
Supporters believe tonight
is the chance to talk
to his base,

06:33.294 --> 06:35.377
but the truth is
tonight should be all about

06:35.377 --> 06:38.627
convincing people
that he can do the job
and be presidential.

06:38.627 --> 06:40.711
Can people picture him
in the White House?

06:40.711 --> 06:42.252
That's the question.

06:42.252 --> 06:44.794
Will his message resonate
with undecided voters?

06:44.794 --> 06:47.711
The spotlight will
be on him tonight
for about an hour

06:47.711 --> 06:50.460
to see if, you know,
he can accomplish just that.

06:50.460 --> 06:53.252
Reporter #3:
There's some good
points here, Michael.

06:53.252 --> 06:55.043
Definitely a big finale
to a long week.

06:55.043 --> 06:57.711
I think it's important
to know that each convention

06:57.711 --> 06:59.252
has its own
story to tell,

06:59.252 --> 07:01.752
from the opening gavel
to the final balloon drop.

07:01.752 --> 07:03.460
- Fuck!
- They're trying
to create the narrative

07:03.460 --> 07:05.752
of conventions
as people.

07:05.752 --> 07:10.127
What's happening here is
that people are proving to be
unpredictable in the polling.

07:10.127 --> 07:13.085
Reporter:
...is one of the most
critical speeches of his life.

07:13.085 --> 07:17.252
One delegate told me
a considerable portion
of the electorate

07:17.252 --> 07:19.377
simply did not see him
as presidential.

07:19.377 --> 07:21.586
His challenge
is to reveal himself

07:21.586 --> 07:23.544
as someone who can
lead a nation.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.544
He cannot be all things
to all people,

07:25.544 --> 07:28.085
but his task will be
to convince millions

07:28.085 --> 07:29.877
that he's up for the job.

07:31.085 --> 07:33.210
( crowd cheering on TV )

07:36.960 --> 07:38.794
Reporter #3:
There's been
some concern that if someone

07:38.794 --> 07:40.960
wanted to make a statement
or do something,

07:40.960 --> 07:43.210
that today
might be that day,

07:43.210 --> 07:45.794
- so we are seeing
a lot of police presence.
- ( knocking on door )

07:49.544 --> 07:52.627
( reporter speaking
on TV )

08:01.794 --> 08:03.794
Reporter:
It's definitely
in his best interest to.

08:03.794 --> 08:05.960
- Reporter #2:
I agree, but...
- Holy shit!

08:05.960 --> 08:07.335
Oh, my God.
( sighs )

08:07.335 --> 08:09.419
- I'm so sorry.
- What the hell?!

08:09.419 --> 08:12.127
- The maid let me in.
- Reporter #2: He's the only one
who can fix it.

08:12.127 --> 08:13.627
- ( door slams )
- We knocked,

08:13.627 --> 08:16.210
but this TV is so...

08:16.210 --> 08:18.294
- Reporter #2: He's had
a lot of things on his...
- ( TV turns off )

08:18.294 --> 08:20.794
Could you just
come back later?

08:20.794 --> 08:23.085
Um, I didn't mean
to alarm you.

08:23.085 --> 08:25.669
I'll be done
in a minute here.

08:25.669 --> 08:30.127
It's my last one, and then
I can get out of your hair.
( chuckles )

08:30.127 --> 08:32.002
Go home.

08:42.002 --> 08:45.502
I'm sorry
we couldn't come sooner,
but we're a man short today.

08:45.502 --> 08:48.502
I'm actually
on my way out.

08:48.502 --> 08:51.502
Could you give me 10 minutes
to pack up my stuff?

08:51.502 --> 08:54.002
Uh, 10 minutes?
I'll be done in five.

08:54.002 --> 08:58.210
- I'm running late.
- Well, don't let me stop you.
Do what you gotta do.

08:59.918 --> 09:02.294
Isn't it a little late
for this?

09:02.294 --> 09:05.210
Yeah, it is.
Sorry about that.

09:05.210 --> 09:06.960
It's been
a crazy day.

09:06.960 --> 09:10.168
Traffic in the city is a mess
with this convention in town.

09:10.168 --> 09:13.627
I had to drive
through the thick of it
three times already.

09:13.627 --> 09:16.460
Innerbelt's
down to one lane

09:16.460 --> 09:18.043
and you can forget
about Prospect.

09:18.043 --> 09:20.711
I finally think
I got a hold on
all these road closures

09:20.711 --> 09:24.711
and, pfft, come out here
and hit another massive jam.

09:24.711 --> 09:27.877
Bunch of rowdy kids
protesting,

09:27.877 --> 09:32.043
getting into the street,
messing up traffic.

09:32.043 --> 09:35.627
( sighs )
Look, if I'm being
honest with you,

09:35.627 --> 09:37.627
I'm at the tail end
of a 12-hour day,

09:37.627 --> 09:39.043
I would just love
to get home

09:39.043 --> 09:41.711
and see the rest
of that speech with my wife.

09:44.294 --> 09:46.377
Please hurry.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.960
I do appreciate it.

09:49.335 --> 09:51.252
Anyway,

09:51.252 --> 09:53.752
don't know how
you could take this heat
a minute longer.

09:57.294 --> 10:00.210
- You in town for
the convention?
- Hmm?

10:00.210 --> 10:02.544
I saw your, uh,
thingy over there.

10:05.043 --> 10:08.252
Oh, uh, yeah.

10:08.252 --> 10:11.460
Yeah, I'm, uh, in town
for the convention, yes.

10:11.460 --> 10:14.419
Well, I guess
you are running late.

10:14.419 --> 10:17.711
I'll have this done
in a minute, I promise.

10:20.085 --> 10:23.419
I kind of have a rule
not to discuss politics
with the customers,

10:23.419 --> 10:26.127
but I figured
you got it on the TV, so.

10:27.502 --> 10:30.127
Yeah, elephant in the room,
so to speak.

10:30.127 --> 10:33.085
Yeah, he's
some kind of elephant,
that's for sure.

10:34.918 --> 10:36.752
Tough to ignore.

10:36.752 --> 10:37.960
Is that what you mean?

10:39.794 --> 10:41.460
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Well...

10:41.460 --> 10:45.127
He really gets
the juices flowing,
you know?

10:45.127 --> 10:46.460
Uh-huh.

10:49.002 --> 10:51.460
You're not
a delegate, are you?

10:53.960 --> 10:57.210
I mean, if you were,
you'd be in that arena
right now, right?

10:57.210 --> 10:59.752
I'm just going to
the after party.

10:59.752 --> 11:01.460
Oh, very nice.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.960
- Some kind of big shot?
- No.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.960
( chuckles )
I hear ya.

11:05.960 --> 11:09.460
Friend of a friend
of a big shot, am I right?

11:11.252 --> 11:13.002
Yeah, like I said,

11:13.002 --> 11:16.043
I usually don't
talk politics with customers,

11:16.043 --> 11:20.335
but it's all anybody wants
to talk about in this town
these days.

11:20.335 --> 11:23.085
Politics and sports.

11:23.085 --> 11:27.127
( chuckles )
I mean, can't we just
vote for LeBron James?

11:28.335 --> 11:30.627
I'm not gay,
but, boy,

11:30.627 --> 11:33.502
I'd have to give it
some serious consideration

11:33.502 --> 11:35.335
if LeBron
asked me to marry him.

11:35.335 --> 11:40.460
I might have to rethink
my whole position on that
gay marriage thing.

11:40.460 --> 11:42.210
( chuckles )

11:42.210 --> 11:44.794
I'm just kidding,
of course.

11:46.502 --> 11:48.043
That's funny.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.127
Hot as the devil
in here.

11:53.127 --> 11:54.586
Yeah.

11:56.544 --> 11:57.836
Where's your
little one?

11:59.377 --> 12:00.419
Little one?

12:00.419 --> 12:01.752
When my boys
were young,

12:01.752 --> 12:05.586
they used to build forts
in the living room,

12:05.586 --> 12:08.168
usually with blankets
and sheets.

12:08.168 --> 12:12.127
Can't say they ever used
an actual tent, though.

12:12.127 --> 12:16.377
Yeah, no, um, ever since
we took him camping,

12:16.377 --> 12:19.085
he's been
obsessed with it.

12:19.085 --> 12:22.002
You know, living room,
backyard, roof.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.502
I'm so accustomed
to seeing it around,

12:23.502 --> 12:25.794
I barely even
notice it anymore.

12:25.794 --> 12:28.252
- How old is he?
- Seven.

12:30.836 --> 12:32.294
Really?

12:32.294 --> 12:34.210
You seem so young.

12:36.210 --> 12:38.586
Started early,
I guess.

12:38.586 --> 12:42.168
Yeah, well,
mine are 18 and 22.

12:42.168 --> 12:45.043
- Wow.
- Yeah, crazy,
little bastards.

12:45.043 --> 12:47.294
Of course, they're not
so little anymore,

12:47.294 --> 12:50.752
so I guess they're just
crazy bastards now.

12:50.752 --> 12:52.294
( chuckles )

12:52.294 --> 12:54.918
Curtis, my older one,
he goes to college.

12:54.918 --> 12:58.586
He's a women's studies major,
God help us.

12:58.586 --> 13:01.918
The younger one,
he's still in high school.

13:01.918 --> 13:05.627
He's a basketball player,
all-state.

13:07.335 --> 13:12.586
Well, truth be told,
they're both great kids.

13:12.586 --> 13:14.419
You know,
really gets you thinking

13:14.419 --> 13:17.460
when they leave the house,
I'll tell you that.

13:17.460 --> 13:19.627
Just don't know
how they're gonna turn out.

13:20.918 --> 13:25.002
Just do your best
and let 'em go,

13:25.002 --> 13:26.960
cross your fingers.

13:29.168 --> 13:31.002
( clattering )

13:34.544 --> 13:36.960
Where'd you say
your boy was?

13:36.960 --> 13:40.252
At home
with my wife.

13:47.377 --> 13:49.794
Right, um,

13:49.794 --> 13:52.960
I know
it looks weird,

13:52.960 --> 13:55.627
but I like to
bring it with me
when I travel.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.210
It makes me
miss him less.

14:00.836 --> 14:03.335
That's--
that's sweet.

14:05.377 --> 14:06.877
( grunts )

14:10.294 --> 14:14.127
- How's it going?
- A few more minutes and...

14:14.127 --> 14:16.168
I'll be
out of your way.

14:16.168 --> 14:18.127
Great.

14:29.627 --> 14:31.210
( exhales )

14:32.836 --> 14:34.085
You want some?

14:34.085 --> 14:36.669
I better not.

14:36.669 --> 14:37.877
Thanks, though.

14:44.502 --> 14:46.836
You think he can win?

14:49.544 --> 14:51.918
He's made it this far.

14:51.918 --> 14:53.877
Yeah.

14:53.877 --> 14:58.335
I just wonder if
this country's ready
for someone so real.

14:59.752 --> 15:01.502
Mm-hmm.

15:01.502 --> 15:04.419
But come November,
he's got my vote.

15:04.419 --> 15:06.043
Good to hear.

15:06.043 --> 15:10.502
Immigration, NAFTA,
the whole mess in
the Middle East.

15:10.502 --> 15:13.419
Oh, your guy really
tells it like it is.

15:13.419 --> 15:15.335
My guy?

15:15.335 --> 15:17.377
I'll tell you what,
though.

15:17.377 --> 15:23.085
Whoever wins, there's gonna be
an army of pissed off people
roaming in the streets.

15:23.085 --> 15:24.752
Fucking Christ!

15:24.752 --> 15:26.252
Careful, would ya?!

15:34.460 --> 15:35.918
I'm sorry.

15:37.502 --> 15:39.419
No, um,

15:39.419 --> 15:42.586
I just--
I overreacted.

15:42.586 --> 15:44.419
I'm sorry.

15:44.419 --> 15:47.586
Ah, it's-- it's okay.

15:47.586 --> 15:50.002
I'd be on edge, too.

15:50.002 --> 15:52.419
It's a big night
for you.

15:53.627 --> 15:55.043
I'll just
finish up here

15:55.043 --> 15:57.085
and then I'll--
I'll be on my way.

16:06.627 --> 16:09.085
That offer still stand?

16:12.294 --> 16:14.085
Ah, I hate to be
that guy,

16:14.085 --> 16:17.877
but I'm kind of
a germ freak.
( chuckles )

16:17.877 --> 16:20.669
Think you could
get me a cup?

16:20.669 --> 16:22.460
Sure.

16:22.460 --> 16:25.502
( music playing )

16:36.294 --> 16:38.877
Ah, here you go!

16:38.877 --> 16:40.627
Here you go.

16:45.794 --> 16:47.836
Phew.

16:47.836 --> 16:50.377
It's been
a long day.

16:52.669 --> 16:55.002
Oh, nice.

16:55.002 --> 16:56.836
That is very nice.
Thank you.

16:56.836 --> 16:59.502
- Small batch bourbon.
- Hmm?

16:59.502 --> 17:01.752
A friend of mine
distills it in Kentucky

17:01.752 --> 17:05.002
and sells it to
hipsters in Brooklyn
for $100 a bottle.

17:05.002 --> 17:07.502
A hundred bucks?
( chuckles )

17:07.502 --> 17:10.460
Wow, everybody's got
an angle, I guess.

17:10.460 --> 17:11.836
Don't they?

17:42.544 --> 17:45.043
( phone beeping )

17:54.711 --> 17:56.586
Excuse me.

18:11.252 --> 18:13.377
Everything okay
in there?

18:13.377 --> 18:16.294
Yeah, just, uh,
give me a second.

18:28.127 --> 18:31.877
- An LG burner,
am I right?
- Yep.

18:31.877 --> 18:35.210
Yeah, I spent a few years
in phone repair.

18:37.252 --> 18:39.085
Want me
to have a look?

18:39.085 --> 18:40.419
No.

18:46.502 --> 18:47.960
You sure?

18:57.294 --> 18:59.002
( inhales )

19:01.168 --> 19:03.460
( beeping ends )

19:03.460 --> 19:07.294
- There you go.
- ( exhales )

19:09.043 --> 19:11.460
( deep breathing )

19:40.460 --> 19:42.002
Everything okay?

19:52.544 --> 19:54.502
If you had
a time machine...

19:55.752 --> 19:57.335
and you could
go back in time

19:57.335 --> 19:59.711
and prevent Hitler
from becoming Hitler...

20:01.043 --> 20:03.127
you have to
do it, right?

20:04.918 --> 20:07.002
A time machine?

20:07.002 --> 20:11.377
Yeah, like
"Back to the Future."

20:11.377 --> 20:13.377
A DeLorean.

20:13.377 --> 20:16.960
88.8 miles per hour,
you can go back in time,

20:16.960 --> 20:21.252
specifically, you go back
to Germany circa 1930,

20:21.252 --> 20:23.794
you're in the same city
as Hitler,

20:23.794 --> 20:27.711
same room,
you have a gun.

20:29.043 --> 20:30.252
Do you do it?

20:35.043 --> 20:36.669
Yeah.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.918
- I guess I would.
- You would?

20:38.918 --> 20:40.419
Yeah.

20:40.419 --> 20:42.252
I mean,
murder is murder.

20:42.252 --> 20:44.877
It'd still be a sin,
I suppose,

20:44.877 --> 20:47.960
but that one
would seem justifiable.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.377
I'd like to think
I'd have the guts to do it.

20:51.460 --> 20:52.544
Right.

20:52.544 --> 20:53.794
Get pretty sticky,
though,

20:53.794 --> 20:55.502
if that time machine
broke down.

20:55.502 --> 20:57.294
I mean,
after you killed Hitler.

20:57.294 --> 21:00.419
It'd be a tough one
to explain to the folks
in the moment.

21:00.419 --> 21:04.586
"Believe me, people, he was
gonna do some bad things."
( chuckles )

21:04.586 --> 21:07.085
I think it'd be
worth the sacrifice,

21:07.085 --> 21:09.794
knowing you prevented
the Holocaust.

21:09.794 --> 21:11.586
I could sleep at night.

21:11.586 --> 21:14.877
But who's to say
another Hitler wouldn't
be waiting in the wings?

21:14.877 --> 21:17.711
You know,
a different Holocaust?

21:17.711 --> 21:20.586
I mean,
one person alone
didn't kill two million Jews.

21:20.586 --> 21:24.085
- Six million.
- Okay, more to my point.

21:24.085 --> 21:28.918
So we somehow associate
this one man with all these
millions of deaths...

21:28.918 --> 21:31.960
- Murders.
- ...but he wasn't
the one pulling the triggers.

21:31.960 --> 21:34.752
Right?
He wasn't the one
dropping the bombs.

21:36.127 --> 21:38.586
Eh, I don't know.

21:38.586 --> 21:42.335
I'm rethinking this now.
Maybe I wouldn't.

21:42.335 --> 21:45.294
- You wouldn't?
- No.

21:45.294 --> 21:48.127
So you're saying you wouldn't
take out the person

21:48.127 --> 21:50.043
who devised and implemented
the destruction

21:50.043 --> 21:52.085
of 11 million
human lives?

21:52.085 --> 21:53.419
You said six million.

21:53.419 --> 21:55.460
Six million Jews,
five million others.

21:55.460 --> 21:59.794
Well, if I knew that it would
prevent those deaths,
then, yeah, sure,

21:59.794 --> 22:01.794
but what I'm saying is
what if it didn't?

22:01.794 --> 22:03.544
And anyway,
it's easy to say,

22:03.544 --> 22:06.252
"If I could've
met Hitler, I would've..."
blah, blah, blah,

22:06.252 --> 22:08.043
but nobody ever did.

22:08.043 --> 22:11.002
So that means
a whole lot of people
must've agreed with him.

22:11.002 --> 22:12.918
You think so?

22:12.918 --> 22:15.460
Maybe they hated
the Jews, too.

22:15.460 --> 22:18.794
- Enough to kill
six million of them?
- Enough to go along with it.

22:21.002 --> 22:24.711
I don't know,
could be they were
living in hateful times.

22:28.544 --> 22:29.836
Right.

22:29.836 --> 22:32.043
Like I said,
it's easy to look back

22:32.043 --> 22:34.002
and say
you would've been better.

22:34.002 --> 22:37.168
- That we'd resist.
- Yeah.

22:37.168 --> 22:39.711
- That we'd do something.
- Sure.

22:39.711 --> 22:42.460
Thing is, we don't have
a time machine, do we?
( chuckles )

22:43.918 --> 22:46.502
You didn't see my DeLorean
parked out front?

22:53.627 --> 22:56.419
( phone ringing )

22:56.419 --> 22:57.836
Sorry.

22:59.960 --> 23:02.377
Uh, it's my wife.
I have to take this.

23:02.377 --> 23:05.836
I really am almost done.
I'll-- I'll be right back.

23:09.586 --> 23:12.210
- Hey, honey.
- ( door closes )

23:12.210 --> 23:14.544
( music playing )

23:39.752 --> 23:42.335
( door opens )

23:42.335 --> 23:46.043
Whoa, looking sharp!

23:46.043 --> 23:50.711
I should really get going,
but feel free to stay
and finish up.

23:50.711 --> 23:55.168
All right, well, room will
be nice and cool for you
when you get back.

23:55.168 --> 23:56.794
Thanks.

23:56.794 --> 24:00.419
By the way, you might
run into my son.
( sighs )

24:00.419 --> 24:01.752
He's part
of a school group

24:01.752 --> 24:03.252
that's been at
the convention all week,

24:03.252 --> 24:04.752
and my wife
just told me

24:04.752 --> 24:06.836
they got invited
to that party tonight.

24:06.836 --> 24:09.252
So he's pretty
jazzed about it.

24:09.252 --> 24:11.085
His name's Gerry.

24:11.085 --> 24:13.794
Not that you'll
run into him,
but who knows?

24:13.794 --> 24:15.752
- Gerry.
- Yeah.

24:15.752 --> 24:17.419
I'm Steve.

24:17.419 --> 24:19.210
Nice chatting
with you.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.294
Alex.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.210
Good to meet you,
Alex.

24:24.210 --> 24:25.669
Have fun tonight,

24:25.669 --> 24:27.960
and good luck
in November.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.627
Thank you.

24:32.752 --> 24:36.377
I'm actually gonna
hit the bathroom
one more time.

24:36.377 --> 24:38.335
( music playing )

24:49.043 --> 24:50.502
( sighs )

25:42.502 --> 25:44.544
All done!

25:44.544 --> 25:46.794
- Great.
- Yeah.

25:46.794 --> 25:48.043
Check it out.

25:49.043 --> 25:51.586
Nah, I--
I should go now.

25:51.586 --> 25:53.752
Stand where
I'm standing, Alex.

25:53.752 --> 25:55.544
See how it feels.

25:57.544 --> 25:59.252
I'm late.

25:59.252 --> 26:01.127
You're sweating.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.419
Come on.

26:06.294 --> 26:08.419
( sighs )

26:08.419 --> 26:09.419
Come on.

26:11.627 --> 26:14.210
Believe me,
you'll thank me later.

26:15.752 --> 26:18.335
- I should really--
- Sit down.

26:25.711 --> 26:27.460
( sighs )

26:35.877 --> 26:38.586
Still got
that thing in there?

26:50.960 --> 26:52.544
Oh, your cup.

27:02.252 --> 27:04.252
