00:00.120 --> 00:03.680
'The men holding Bratton
used this boy as a suicide bomber.'

00:03.680 --> 00:06.240
It's him, isn't it?
It looks like him.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.560
He owes me a debt of honour.

00:08.560 --> 00:11.600
'I demand the release of my brother,
Mohammed Jassim Ali.'

00:11.600 --> 00:15.520
'Unless this holy warrior is freed,
the hostage will be executed.'

00:15.520 --> 00:18.560
'Tell Porter he's been reactivated.'

00:47.800 --> 00:52.040
"Porter's gone AWOL, sir." Have you
any idea where he might be headed?

00:52.040 --> 00:56.320
"The tracker in his tooth
has him 35 clicks east of here."

00:56.320 --> 01:02.200
"30 degrees, 30.24 minutes north.
47 degrees, 49 point..."

01:02.200 --> 01:06.000
..at a safe house in an
apartment block in Basra City.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.120
Go, go, go!

01:09.400 --> 01:13.000
"It's a southern suburb of Basra -"
Yes!

01:13.000 --> 01:17.480
I know it. Porter's chasing
the only lead he has.

01:19.240 --> 01:22.720
He's outside the safe house that
was used to hold Kenneth Bratton.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.320
Do you want me to contact Basra
police, have them intercept Porter?

01:38.320 --> 01:41.000
No.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.720
He's waited seven years for
a second chance. Let him have it.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.600
'Shoot him! John, shoot him!'

03:21.600 --> 03:26.000
It's OK.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.040
Hakim Al Nazeri.

04:38.440 --> 04:41.200
Hakim Al Nazeri!

04:50.520 --> 04:53.360
Hakim Al Nazeri.

05:01.640 --> 05:04.160
Hakim Al Nazeri.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.560
Hakim Al Nazeri.

05:30.280 --> 05:34.280
We're both gonna have a much easier
time if you can speak English.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.400
I speak English.
Good.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.640
Where is Hakim Al Nazeri?
I don't know what you're talk...

05:39.640 --> 05:41.560
Aaaargh! Aieee!

05:43.400 --> 05:47.240
Alright. Let's try that again,
shall we?

05:47.240 --> 05:50.800
Point one, our friends there came
running after hearing his name.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.400
Point two, before the invasion this
place was a safe house for a hostage.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.080
I know that,
I was sent to get him out.

05:57.080 --> 06:02.200
Point three, I'm gonna start using
this knife in more inventive ways

06:02.200 --> 06:04.960
unless you tell me where
they're holding

06:04.960 --> 06:07.920
the remaining 95 percent
of the English infidel.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.920
They will kill you, my friend.
Maybe.

06:10.920 --> 06:13.600
Or maybe they'll hear what I've got
to trade.

06:13.600 --> 06:18.200
You need to ask yourself how much
Hakim wants Jassim out of Belmarsh.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.080
Who is this?
Do you miss me?

06:25.080 --> 06:27.280
"Porter!"
I contacted Sword of Islam.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.080
I'm off to rendezvous
with my pet theory. Hakim?

06:30.080 --> 06:33.280
Could be a trap,
could be a wild goose chase.

06:33.280 --> 06:37.040
I'm gonna have to hang up now.
Porter, keep this line open.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.160
Porter?! Shit!

06:42.160 --> 06:45.800
So, now we can't be traced, OK?

06:45.800 --> 06:48.720
Take the next left.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.480
What are you doing?
Call of nature.

07:35.440 --> 07:38.400
This road better be flat.

07:43.240 --> 07:46.360
Is this it?
You'll soon find out.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.080
Out!

07:56.440 --> 07:58.960
Aaargh! It hurts!

08:00.240 --> 08:02.760
We really can't go on like this.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.320
All yours, hero.

08:47.160 --> 08:51.480
Who are you? I'm sorry, sir,
I can't answer that question.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.560
We've just lost Porter.
We've lost him, too. Shit!

11:10.200 --> 11:15.880
We lost contact with Bravo team
at 15:21 GMT, 18:21 local time.

11:17.400 --> 11:21.040
In our last communication he claimed
to be heading to a rendezvous

11:21.040 --> 11:24.840
with a former Mukhabarat colonel,
Hakim Al Nazeri,

11:24.840 --> 11:28.120
a man we believe might be the
commander of Sword of Islam.

11:28.120 --> 11:32.680
This satellite image of Al Kanan
was Porter's last known position.

11:32.680 --> 11:35.680
It was taken at 18:36 local time

11:35.680 --> 11:39.680
and shows four vehicles outside the
building. Track the vehicles?

11:39.680 --> 11:44.080
No. By the time we got a second
satellite image an hour ago,

11:44.080 --> 11:48.200
the vehicles were gone. And Porter.
We have Charlie team on standby.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.160
We can have then on the ground
in Basra in five hours.

11:51.160 --> 11:55.080
And a helicopter to where they might
find clues to Katie's whereabouts.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.880
Or a booby-trap.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.840
We have less than 52 hours
before they execute Katie.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.880
If we delay - Hugh, count yourself
lucky the Sword of Islam

12:11.880 --> 12:15.960
haven't already posted pictures of
dead soldiers on their website.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.120
Authorisation denied.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.400
We've lost five men in 25 hours.

12:36.400 --> 12:40.320
What did you expect? Sir, Porter has
given us this location.

12:40.320 --> 12:44.600
We can't let these men's deaths be
in vain. I've no intention of that.

12:44.600 --> 12:49.440
You find me another mission as
cover... and you've got Charlie team.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.400
Sir.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.160
Hi, Alexandra.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.320
Is your mother here?

13:19.360 --> 13:20.800
Mum!

13:26.760 --> 13:29.200
This is about my dad, isn't it?

13:30.600 --> 13:32.520
Hugh.
Diane.

13:34.400 --> 13:38.080
GCHQ monitoring recorded John
has a lost signal.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.680
Please speak English.
Alex.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.800
Your father volunteered for a
dangerous mission in Iraq.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.800
Who sent him?
You know I can't tell you that.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.760
You. You sent him, didn't you?

13:53.760 --> 13:57.480
I can't go into detail but the
manner in which we lost contact

13:57.480 --> 14:00.920
with John makes us feel that -
Don't you dare! Don't you dare!

14:00.920 --> 14:03.240
My dad's not..

14:04.480 --> 14:07.360
I'm so sorry.
No, get off me!

14:07.360 --> 14:09.760
You're a liar!
Alex...

14:15.600 --> 14:17.560
Listen, um...

14:19.600 --> 14:22.440
..I know how much you've done
for John. Thank you.

14:22.440 --> 14:25.920
But... the truth is, Er...

14:27.160 --> 14:29.600
..we're all better off without him.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.520
Diane, he was -
No, you're better off too.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.560
Whatever it was that made you
look out for him...

14:39.120 --> 14:41.480
..it's gone. You're free.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Who are you?
Katie...

16:10.760 --> 16:13.240
My name's John.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.080
I'm SAS.

16:20.760 --> 16:23.120
It's alright, don't be frightened.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.400
Katie...

16:27.760 --> 16:30.640
..we're gonna get you out of here.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.080
OK?

16:33.400 --> 16:37.400
You're a brave girl.
 Brave girl.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.320
Brave girl.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.440
Shh. It's OK.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.520
It's OK.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.960
Shh.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.880
Katie, look at me. Look at me.
Whatever happens, trust me!

17:07.880 --> 17:10.040
You trust me!

17:36.760 --> 17:39.560
You said you were here to negotiate.

17:39.560 --> 17:43.640
Is that true? Sorry, sir,
I can't answer that question.

17:45.200 --> 17:49.400
What is your mission? I'm sorry,
sir, I can't answer that question.

18:13.800 --> 18:17.800
By what means do the British plan
to rescue the hostage?

18:17.800 --> 18:21.080
I'm sorry, sir,
I can't answer that question.

18:33.560 --> 18:36.000
No! No! No, no!

18:36.000 --> 18:37.960
What are you doing?! No!

18:48.760 --> 18:50.720
Tell me.

18:51.960 --> 18:55.960
Let me talk to her! If she wants me
to talk, she can tell me.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.400
Katie. Katie, look at me.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.360
Look at me.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.560
Trust me.

19:17.200 --> 19:21.680
Just so you know, I'm gonna kill
every single of of these bastards.

19:22.560 --> 19:26.160
Tell me! I'm sorry, sir,
I can't answer that question.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.640
Tell me!

19:28.640 --> 19:32.000
I'm sorry, sir, I can't answer
that question.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.080
Leave her alone, you fucker!

19:48.440 --> 19:50.360
Leave her alone!

20:20.760 --> 20:24.400
You let her suffer... to resist me.

20:24.400 --> 20:28.800
You're not gonna kill her. Not while
you still have her to bargain with.

20:31.800 --> 20:36.040
Katie Dartmouth's death was
inevitable the moment I took her.

20:38.640 --> 20:41.480
But because of you, I'm forced to

20:41.480 --> 20:44.880
bring forward the deadline
for her execution.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.720
We will kill her tomorrow at dawn.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.920
And you will be first.

21:40.440 --> 21:43.180
"Charlie Team have been
deployed undercover

21:43.180 --> 21:46.580
of a joint operation
with our American friends."

21:46.580 --> 21:49.820
"How quickly can you be
where we lost Porter's signal?"

21:49.820 --> 21:52.820
We can be airborne immediately.
Good work.

22:18.780 --> 22:23.020
Shh. It's OK. It's OK.
It's only me. It's John.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.940
We're gonna get through this.
You and me.

22:42.620 --> 22:45.060
You know that, don't you?

22:46.100 --> 22:48.260
Yes.

22:48.260 --> 22:50.780
Good girl.

22:50.780 --> 22:54.700
I'm just gonna loosen these ropes
to make you more comfortable.

22:58.020 --> 23:00.300
Is that better?
Yeah.

23:01.540 --> 23:04.020
How does that arm feel?

23:04.020 --> 23:06.060
Just numb.

23:09.620 --> 23:12.500
I need to have a look at it.
Is that OK?

23:14.620 --> 23:16.860
Yeah. OK.

23:43.260 --> 23:45.340
Clear!

23:47.860 --> 23:50.100
'Clear!'

23:53.860 --> 23:55.740
'Clear!'

24:00.180 --> 24:05.340
How did you find me? The photo
you took of the young man...

24:06.580 --> 24:09.460
..led me to you.

24:11.060 --> 24:14.300
Really, I just wanted an autograph.

24:18.100 --> 24:20.580
Looks good.

24:20.580 --> 24:23.020
There's no infection.

24:24.660 --> 24:28.020
Now listen.

24:28.020 --> 24:30.660
They'll come for me first.

24:30.660 --> 24:35.540
That's our chance. I'll overpower
them. Then I'll come back for you.

24:37.820 --> 24:40.260
Gonna get you home, Katie.

24:44.780 --> 24:48.620
I'll need to put this hood back on.
I'm sorry.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.820
I understand.

24:57.020 --> 24:58.980
OK.

25:04.420 --> 25:07.220
OK.
Oh, please don't go.

25:07.220 --> 25:11.220
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm right here. I'm right here.

25:11.220 --> 25:15.860
OK. OK.

25:31.220 --> 25:34.340
'I think Porter
might still be alive.'

25:34.340 --> 25:37.820
'They've cleaned out, left the body
of one of their soldiers.'

25:37.820 --> 25:40.180
My guess is he's the man
who led Porter to them.

25:40.180 --> 25:43.620
If they left his body, Porter's
would be there. It stands to reason.

25:43.620 --> 25:48.060
There's a chance he's alive. We can
effect a rescue. Sir. One moment.

25:48.060 --> 25:52.700
All Islam locations are within
30 kilometres of each other.

25:52.700 --> 25:56.260
If we centre a radius
from the point of abduction,

25:56.260 --> 26:00.580
we narrow the search to specific
sites. Know the car he was driving?

26:00.580 --> 26:04.700
Yeah, a Range Rover. "Get back
to base but be airborne by dawn."

26:04.700 --> 26:08.340
We'll give you new coordinates
for an aerial search.

26:08.340 --> 26:11.780
You've got 25 hours, Layla.
There's still time.

26:30.180 --> 26:33.580
"This is Alpha.
Resuming search. Over."

26:47.100 --> 26:50.140
Don't move.

26:52.140 --> 26:54.700
What? What are we...?

26:54.700 --> 26:58.260
Where are you taking me? John!
John, where are they taking me?

26:58.260 --> 27:03.340
Oh, God! No!
Don't be frightened! Trust me.

27:03.340 --> 27:06.740
Help me! You bastard!
You said you'd take me first!

27:09.060 --> 27:11.220
I lied.

27:31.060 --> 27:33.580
Just coming up now, sir.

27:38.820 --> 27:43.540
Our demand for the release
of our brother has gone unheeded.

27:43.540 --> 27:47.980
They have shown no intention
of negotiating in good faith.

27:47.980 --> 27:52.140
That is why we shall execute Katie
Dartmouth in a few short minutes.

27:52.140 --> 27:56.980
Layla, they've brought it forward.
They'll execute Katie this morning.

28:21.940 --> 28:24.220
No! No!

28:24.220 --> 28:26.700
No! Don't!

28:35.180 --> 28:37.980
No! No! No!

28:37.980 --> 28:40.940
No! No!

28:53.300 --> 28:56.260
Oh, God! No!

29:06.620 --> 29:09.100
Katie!

30:42.260 --> 30:45.780
Don't shoot him. Don't. You know
why I have to kill you, don't you?

30:45.780 --> 30:48.700
Please!
I wanna hear you say it!

30:50.700 --> 30:53.900
John, think.
He could have shot you.

30:53.900 --> 30:56.460
This is for killing
Mike and Keith and for Steve.

31:01.460 --> 31:04.380
He says it wasn't him.
He says it wasn't him.

31:04.380 --> 31:08.220
No shit. He's got a gun in his face!
Does he look like a killer?

31:12.700 --> 31:16.180
He swears he didn't kill your
friends. Who did? Tell me that.

31:23.740 --> 31:26.220
We have to go now.
Move!

31:27.580 --> 31:31.420
Go! Move! Move!

31:37.260 --> 31:38.940
Go.

31:58.700 --> 32:00.700
"Heading north."

32:02.420 --> 32:04.740
"Continuing towards the radius."

32:04.740 --> 32:07.740
"Any developments?" They haven't
uploaded the execution.

32:07.740 --> 32:11.020
Until we hear otherwise,
assume Katie and Porter are alive.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.180
Hold on!

32:37.200 --> 32:40.400
John.
Yep.

32:47.540 --> 32:51.660
Give me a shout
if you see a phone box. Telephone?

32:55.220 --> 32:57.460
John.

32:57.460 --> 32:59.620
Fuck.

33:08.260 --> 33:10.580
Come on, pick up.

33:12.540 --> 33:16.900
"This is Lieutenant Thompson. Please
leave a message." Shit. Redial. OK.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.780
Hold on!

33:23.500 --> 33:25.660
We need to get off this road.

33:57.460 --> 34:00.100
Hello?
Hello? John!

34:00.100 --> 34:02.780
Layla? Layla, it's Porter.

34:02.780 --> 34:07.340
Porter, thank God! Sir,
we have contact from Bravo Team.

34:08.260 --> 34:10.739
Hold on, Layla.

34:11.940 --> 34:14.340
Right, get out,
get down behind the wheels.

34:14.340 --> 34:19.179
We have to make a stand. I have the
hostage. We now have the hostage.

34:20.340 --> 34:23.820
Bravo has Dartmouth, sir.
She's alive.

34:23.820 --> 34:27.820
What's your position?
Repeat, what's your position, Bravo?

34:27.820 --> 34:31.739
Just turned off a desert highway
heading southwest

34:31.739 --> 34:35.219
at an intersection of high voltage
pylons running north-south.

34:35.219 --> 34:37.699
Two vehicles in pursuit.

34:42.020 --> 34:46.739
"Found you. On our way. ETA
four minutes. Repeat, four minutes."

34:50.340 --> 34:51.980
Fuck.

34:53.500 --> 34:58.260
Pass me that. I also have Scarface.
Repeat, I also... Layla?

34:58.260 --> 35:00.900
"Porter?"
Layla!

35:00.900 --> 35:03.460
"Porter, can you hear me?"

35:10.140 --> 35:12.580
Shit.
"We have a visual on the pylons."

35:12.580 --> 35:16.220
"15km from target.
ETA three minutes."

35:25.100 --> 35:26.580
Fuck.

35:27.820 --> 35:29.900
Shit.

35:29.900 --> 35:32.340
I'm sorry.
Don't be.

35:53.580 --> 35:57.700
No! Hold position!

35:57.700 --> 36:00.660
There's someone else with Bravo,
sir!

36:00.660 --> 36:02.740
It's Scarface, sir!

36:02.740 --> 36:04.940
"I'll put you on head-cam."

36:08.980 --> 36:14.580
"Confirm, Bravo has the SOI soldier,
designation Scarface!"

36:14.580 --> 36:17.180
"Do we extract new contact?"

36:26.500 --> 36:29.140
"Do you copy?"

36:29.140 --> 36:33.220
"Do we extract new contact
with Bravo and hostage?"

36:33.220 --> 36:35.740
Extraction denied.

36:35.740 --> 36:38.860
Repeat, do not extract Scarface.

36:44.700 --> 36:47.740
Copy.
"Landing now."

36:59.260 --> 37:01.260
Stay low.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.180
Head down!

37:06.180 --> 37:09.700
Not you! On your knees!

37:11.020 --> 37:13.180
Katie, sit here.

37:16.540 --> 37:20.420
"This is 28 Alpha.
Hostage secure. Moving now."

37:20.420 --> 37:24.780
What? What are you doing?
Wait! As'ad!

37:26.180 --> 37:28.460
John, they're leaving him!

37:32.180 --> 37:35.500
Layla, we need to go back now!
Orders from Collinson!

37:35.500 --> 37:38.140
They'll kill him!

37:41.100 --> 37:44.620
No! Collinson, we need to go back!
Now!

37:44.620 --> 37:46.780
"Collinson, just give the order!"

37:46.780 --> 37:49.620
"Zero, this is 28 Alpha.
Do we return?"

37:49.620 --> 37:52.340
"Repeat, do we return? Over."

37:53.660 --> 37:56.180
"Collinson, don't do this!"

37:58.060 --> 38:02.460
"Collinson, you bastard! Collinson!
Collinson!"

38:50.060 --> 38:53.180
"The abducted television journalist
Katie Dartmouth

38:53.180 --> 38:57.780
is recovering in a US air base after
a daring rescue..."

38:57.780 --> 39:00.800
"Although no details have been
released by the Ministry of Defence,

39:00.800 --> 39:03.880
sources have told us that
the rescue came moments before

39:03.880 --> 39:06.640
the deadline was announced
for her execution."

39:06.640 --> 39:10.080
"Miss Dartmouth is expected
to fly home tomorrow morning."

39:10.080 --> 39:12.720
"We have this report..."
Oh, my God!

39:14.880 --> 39:19.000
Dad! Dad!

39:43.080 --> 39:46.200
Yeah?

39:53.680 --> 39:55.240
John.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.960
That's very kind.

40:16.480 --> 40:19.800
I'm one of the lucky ones.
I came home.

40:22.800 --> 40:26.840
My father supported the invasion
and the war that followed,

40:26.840 --> 40:30.200
an extension of which
is still going on in Afghanistan.

40:32.880 --> 40:35.600
My family have had a taste
of what British forces

40:35.600 --> 40:39.280
and Iraqi families have gone through
these past few years.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.840
And we are humbled by it.

40:45.760 --> 40:49.720
My heart goes out to those families
on both sides

40:49.720 --> 40:52.440
whose loved ones
will never come home.

41:09.080 --> 41:11.360
I owe you an apology.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.280
Oh?

41:16.680 --> 41:19.040
You did an extraordinary thing
out there.

41:22.200 --> 41:25.240
Not gonna kiss me, are you?
No.

41:26.360 --> 41:29.800
Don't get all sentimental on me
like that.

41:29.800 --> 41:32.240
I think I preferred you
with low self-esteem.

41:36.480 --> 41:38.960
What will you do now?

41:40.240 --> 41:42.720
I'm gonna see a man about a job.

41:46.240 --> 41:48.600
I'm glad you came in.

41:48.600 --> 41:53.040
As a friend, I owe you
an explanation about Scarface.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.720
As'ad.
Yes.

41:58.760 --> 42:00.800
As'ad.

42:01.880 --> 42:04.400
I was forced to weigh
the intelligence value

42:04.400 --> 42:07.480
he might have been able to provide
against the risk he posed

42:07.480 --> 42:11.680
as a known terrorist.
Suppose he'd had a change of heart

42:11.680 --> 42:14.000
and tried to bring down
the helicopter?

42:14.000 --> 42:17.960
We could've lost Katie on the very
brink of getting her to safety.

42:17.960 --> 42:22.600
Katie,... I need you to tell me

42:22.600 --> 42:25.360
everything As'ad said to you.

42:28.680 --> 42:32.240
About what happened
the night you saved his life? Yeah.

42:36.200 --> 42:37.960
He said...

42:40.240 --> 42:44.200
He said that the man who killed
your friends was another soldier.

42:45.640 --> 42:47.760
An Iraqi soldier...

42:52.360 --> 42:54.720
..or a British soldier?

42:58.560 --> 43:00.800
You do understand, don't you, John?

43:02.320 --> 43:04.480
Of course.

43:04.480 --> 43:08.160
I would've done exactly the same
thing if I was in your shoes.

43:08.160 --> 43:10.120
Good.

43:11.280 --> 43:12.920
Good.

43:14.400 --> 43:17.120
So, have you come to a decision?

43:20.320 --> 43:22.960
About our offer to join Section 20?

43:24.000 --> 43:26.040
Yeah.

43:28.280 --> 43:30.520
Yes, I have.
