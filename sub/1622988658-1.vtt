WEBVTT

00:59.589 --> 01:02.589
- What the fuck is taking
so long, man?

01:04.693 --> 01:09.134
God, this is taking forever!

01:09.203 --> 01:12.137
Does anything fucking
work right anymore?

01:13.372 --> 01:17.439
I got somewhere to be!
I got a meeting!

01:20.511 --> 01:21.877
Oh.

01:21.946 --> 01:23.145
I'm just fucking with you.
I don't have anywhere to be.

01:23.214 --> 01:27.152
I don't have a meeting.
I don't even have a job.

01:30.983 --> 01:32.454
Hey, what about you there,
Miss Lonely Heart?

01:32.523 --> 01:33.653
You got a job?

01:38.628 --> 01:42.365
You remind me
a lot of my mother.

01:44.766 --> 01:47.700
It's okay, I get it.

01:49.375 --> 01:52.639
You're a sick puppy,
aren't you?

03:16.330 --> 03:20.023
Something's not right.

03:21.665 --> 03:25.798
Some kind of bug.

03:35.877 --> 03:38.217
Let's explore it.

04:01.573 --> 04:04.639
True tactile displacement.

04:15.785 --> 04:19.819
Experiencing
powerful resistive force.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.578
Experiencing haptic feedback
in the mouth.

05:11.038 --> 05:14.808
Experiencing haptic feedback.

06:16.906 --> 06:20.940
-

06:38.763 --> 06:43.160
- Hey.
What are you doing?

06:43.229 --> 06:45.602
- Working.
- On a Saturday night?

06:45.671 --> 06:47.170
- What do you want, Mom?

06:47.239 --> 06:50.134
- I just saw a mouse
in my living room.

06:50.203 --> 06:52.103
- It's the heat.

06:52.172 --> 06:53.204
- In the summer,
it's the heat.

06:53.273 --> 06:54.272
In the winter, it's the cold.

06:54.341 --> 06:55.840
- They always have
their reasons.

06:55.909 --> 06:59.550
- Yep, I-I saw it crawling in
out of my vent.

06:59.619 --> 07:01.112
- That's how they travel,
through vents.

07:01.181 --> 07:02.313
It's like that movie "Alien."

07:02.382 --> 07:05.490
- Yeah.
Well, I sealed the hole.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.723
- He'll find another hole.

07:07.792 --> 07:10.121
- Well, what, then,
set a trap?

07:10.190 --> 07:12.563
- No, what if it gets trapped
in a place you can't find it

07:12.632 --> 07:15.093
and then it sits there and rots
and stinks up the place?

07:15.162 --> 07:18.635
- I'll just set the trap
somewhere I can reach it.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.736
- What if it's a mouse
with a lot of fight in it

07:20.805 --> 07:23.167
and it doesn't die right away
and it runs to a place

07:23.236 --> 07:24.602
you can't find it
and it dies there?

07:24.671 --> 07:27.743
- Oh, dear God.
How would you kill it?

07:27.812 --> 07:29.107
- I'd shoot it,
cut off its head,

07:29.176 --> 07:32.880
and stick it on the lawn.

07:32.949 --> 07:35.146
- You always take things
too far, Jean.

07:35.215 --> 07:36.781
- Make an example of it.

07:36.850 --> 07:38.583
- This is why
you don't have a boyfriend.

07:38.652 --> 07:41.425
I tell all my friends
it's because you're so smart.

07:41.494 --> 07:42.860
Men don't like smart women.
I would know.

07:42.929 --> 07:45.222
- That's not the reason
I don't have a boyfriend, Mom.

07:45.291 --> 07:46.757
- You need to get out more.

07:46.826 --> 07:49.996
Working from home
is no way to live.

07:50.065 --> 07:52.163
- Well, maybe by the time
I finish my work,

07:52.232 --> 07:53.331
your girlfriends
won't have to rely

07:53.400 --> 07:55.639
on their drunk,
abusive husbands anymore.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.168
Maybe neither will you.

07:57.237 --> 08:00.644
- That's enough.

08:00.713 --> 08:02.346
- I got to go, Mom.

08:02.415 --> 08:05.176
- You know, I just read
an interesting article online.

08:05.245 --> 08:07.750
It says it's not too late
for women over 35

08:07.819 --> 08:10.115
who are thinking
about freezing their eggs.

08:10.184 --> 08:14.988
It's very mainstream now,
especially in your industry.

08:17.730 --> 08:20.961
No matter
what goes wrong

09:59.865 --> 10:04.735
There was real contact...

10:04.804 --> 10:07.771
and then I went offline.

10:07.840 --> 10:12.006
There was some kind of glitch.

10:12.075 --> 10:15.339
My avatar froze.

10:15.408 --> 10:17.682
It just froze.

10:34.999 --> 10:38.703
-

10:59.826 --> 11:02.089
- I lost all sense
of orientation.

11:03.896 --> 11:07.358
I was frozen, but...

11:07.427 --> 11:09.360
it kept going.

11:34.993 --> 11:36.486
-

11:38.223 --> 11:41.194
- It was like I was watching
this thing happen to me

11:41.263 --> 11:43.460
and I couldn't do
anything about it.

18:47.656 --> 18:51.459
-

23:58.571 --> 24:02.000
-

24:15.753 --> 24:19.523
your kind of love

24:32.770 --> 24:35.198
at home--

24:54.385 --> 24:55.922
- Jean?

24:58.026 --> 24:59.926
Why are you calling me?

25:03.031 --> 25:04.568
What's wrong?

25:11.908 --> 25:14.204
Jean...

25:14.273 --> 25:16.547
talk to me.

25:20.312 --> 25:22.685
I'm right here.

25:30.355 --> 25:31.921
Oh, honey, one day,
God willing,

25:31.990 --> 25:33.523
you'll be a mother,
and you'll understand

25:33.592 --> 25:37.601
what it means to worry
about your child.

25:42.906 --> 25:46.137
Well, speaking of which,
did you--

25:46.206 --> 25:48.370
did you open that link
that I sent you

25:48.439 --> 25:50.845
about freezing your eggs?

25:53.345 --> 25:55.014
Jean?

25:56.953 --> 25:59.084
I'm sorry, honey.
I--

25:59.153 --> 26:02.725
We can talk tomorrow.

28:27.235 --> 28:30.906
your love away

28:43.119 --> 28:47.087
your love away

28:47.156 --> 28:49.320
- I got somewhere to be!
I got a meeting!

28:57.401 --> 28:59.836
I'm just fucking with you.
I don't have a meeting.

28:59.905 --> 29:02.069
I don't even have a job.

29:02.138 --> 29:03.532
What about you there,
Miss Lonely Heart?

29:03.601 --> 29:05.908
You got a job?

29:05.977 --> 29:09.241
You remind me
a lot of my mother.

29:09.310 --> 29:11.144
It's okay.
I get it.

29:11.213 --> 29:13.509
You're a sick puppy,
aren't you?

29:13.578 --> 29:15.852
I'm a sick puppy, too.

29:15.921 --> 29:17.953
That's why I'm gonna spare you,

29:18.022 --> 29:21.088
even though you are
pretty fucking ungrateful.

29:21.157 --> 29:23.926
Hey, guess what.

29:23.995 --> 29:25.928
I'm so fucking full of love,
I feel like I'm--

29:35.171 --> 29:39.843
I keep having
this recurring dream.

29:42.013 --> 29:44.243
I'm a fetus in the womb.

29:44.312 --> 29:48.181
I've got a sword
and a dog named Ringo,

29:48.250 --> 29:51.250
like Toto from...

29:51.319 --> 29:52.922
"The Wizard of Oz"
or something.

29:55.422 --> 29:59.390
And my mother is nine months
pregnant with me,

29:59.459 --> 30:02.558
and she's trying to abort me...

30:02.627 --> 30:06.133
like, stabbing herself
all over,

30:06.202 --> 30:08.366
And--and Ringo's barking,
trying to get her to stop,

30:08.435 --> 30:10.940
and I'm in the womb,
like, sword in hand,

30:11.009 --> 30:14.405
skillfully defending myself,
and...

30:14.474 --> 30:17.606
I escape from the womb...

30:17.675 --> 30:21.247
and my mother...

30:21.316 --> 30:23.414
she's dead.

30:27.058 --> 30:28.991
And then I wake up.

30:35.594 --> 30:38.000
You must have been Ringo.

31:05.461 --> 31:09.064
- So when do you have
to bring this in?

31:09.133 --> 31:13.068
- They want me to put it
on tape for tomorrow.

31:13.137 --> 31:16.269
- What's your point of view?
-

31:17.669 --> 31:21.142
- What are you coming in with?

31:23.345 --> 31:25.311
- I mean...

31:29.615 --> 31:34.056
Like, self-loathing,
self-hate, um...

31:37.326 --> 31:41.228
No? No?

31:41.297 --> 31:44.066
- Self-hate...

31:44.135 --> 31:46.497
needs to be fuller.

31:54.112 --> 31:57.442
It's a mother-daughter
story moment.

32:02.186 --> 32:05.384
I know you understand that.

32:08.357 --> 32:10.059
I know you do.

32:12.064 --> 32:15.658
You're just
not connected to it.

32:15.727 --> 32:19.332
- Yeah, I thought I was.
- Mm-mm.

32:19.401 --> 32:22.203
These aren't your words.

32:24.307 --> 32:28.275
The words must be
like gasoline.

32:29.741 --> 32:34.248
Say it like it will
set you on fire.

32:34.317 --> 32:36.547
Say it like you have shit

32:36.616 --> 32:39.957
in your mouth.

32:43.194 --> 32:45.655
Do you understand?

32:45.724 --> 32:48.625
- Mm-hmm.

32:48.694 --> 32:50.396
Mm-hmm.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.071
Yeah, I think--
I think so.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.238
- Don't think.

32:59.375 --> 33:01.242
Do.

34:16.716 --> 34:18.220
- Hi, you guys.

34:18.289 --> 34:21.256
I'm so excited to be

34:21.325 --> 34:22.884
having the season finale
with you guys tonight.

34:22.953 --> 34:25.293
We will be watching.
We'll be live-tweeting.

34:25.362 --> 34:28.263
Thank you, thank you, thank you
so much for supporting us,

34:28.332 --> 34:31.233
for loving on us,
for watching with us.

34:31.302 --> 34:35.435
So tonight 9:00, 8:00 Central,
be there or be square.

34:35.504 --> 34:36.601
Bam.

35:05.402 --> 35:07.797
I escape from the womb,

35:07.866 --> 35:11.141
and my mother...

35:13.938 --> 35:15.937
She's dead,

35:16.006 --> 35:18.577
and then I wake up.

35:18.646 --> 35:21.580
You must have been Ringo.

35:25.554 --> 35:26.948
- Okay.

35:27.017 --> 35:28.884
- Was that weird?

35:28.953 --> 35:32.525
Yeah, no,
it felt a little off, right?

35:32.594 --> 35:34.527
- I just don't want
to overstep, you know?

35:34.596 --> 35:36.628
- No, no, no, please.

35:36.697 --> 35:38.432
- I mean, it's not how
I would play it,

35:38.501 --> 35:40.335
but that could just be me.

35:44.342 --> 35:48.211
- Okay, okay, um...

35:48.280 --> 35:51.478
I just thought that,
you know, this is a difficult--

35:51.547 --> 35:52.579
- Mm-hmm.

35:52.648 --> 35:54.712
- A difficult conversation
for her to have,

35:54.781 --> 35:58.353
and, you know, it's--it's hard
for her to talk about,

35:58.422 --> 35:59.816
so I didn't want to go crazy.

35:59.885 --> 36:01.323
- I know.

36:01.392 --> 36:04.755
- And I mean,
it's--it's--

36:04.824 --> 36:05.823
Her mom is trying to kill her,

36:05.892 --> 36:08.330
but in the end,
she has to kill her mom.

36:09.829 --> 36:12.466
I mean, that's...

36:12.535 --> 36:14.600
It's horrible.

37:01.353 --> 37:05.453
- They have you reading
for the sister now?

37:05.522 --> 37:08.324
- Yep.

37:12.892 --> 37:15.364
- Everything okay?

37:15.433 --> 37:17.498
- Everything's fine.

37:19.536 --> 37:21.865
- You don't have to say
everything's fine

37:21.934 --> 37:23.537
when it's not.

37:29.975 --> 37:32.282
- Uh...

37:34.518 --> 37:38.849
Soldiers,
when they get back from war,

37:38.918 --> 37:43.084
then they have PTSD.

37:43.153 --> 37:46.362
You ever wonder why?

37:46.431 --> 37:47.990
Because there's no time
for feeling

37:48.059 --> 37:51.763
when all you're trying to do
is not get shot.

37:51.832 --> 37:55.833
You are dark-skinned...

37:55.902 --> 37:59.738
Black woman in America.

37:59.807 --> 38:01.740
Just right out of the gate,
you're at war,

38:01.809 --> 38:05.040
trying to survive.

38:05.109 --> 38:08.417
- Are you saying
I have PTSD?

38:08.486 --> 38:12.113
- I'm saying for you
to get to this point,

38:12.182 --> 38:17.118
you've overcome real pain.

38:17.187 --> 38:21.859
But overcoming and dealing
is not the same thing.

38:30.541 --> 38:33.134
When was the last time

38:33.203 --> 38:35.906
you spoke to your mom?

38:35.975 --> 38:38.447
- We text.

38:40.584 --> 38:42.748
- You need to talk to her.

40:37.635 --> 40:39.260
- Video hit subscri--
- He had--

40:39.329 --> 40:41.196
- Like, flung around
and was, like--

40:50.615 --> 40:56.277
why he moves me

41:27.579 --> 41:32.148
does he love me, too?

42:12.191 --> 42:13.557
- No!

42:13.626 --> 42:15.994
And you knew
all the time

42:47.061 --> 42:49.225
- You're beginning
to catch the anger,

42:49.294 --> 42:51.964
but...
-

42:52.033 --> 42:55.231
- You need to go deeper.

42:55.300 --> 42:58.366
What's underneath the anger?

42:58.435 --> 43:01.039
- Are you kidding me?
- Mona...

43:01.108 --> 43:05.648
your look,
it will get you into the room,

43:05.717 --> 43:09.278
but your ability
to reveal yourself,

43:09.347 --> 43:10.785
that will keep you there.

43:10.854 --> 43:13.117
- How can you even say
that to me, Wanda?

43:13.186 --> 43:16.989
- Mm-mm-mm, you need to live
in your pain.

43:17.058 --> 43:18.287
- Oh.

43:18.356 --> 43:19.255
- You need to live
in the trauma.

43:19.324 --> 43:20.389
- Look, don't, okay?
Don't.

43:20.458 --> 43:24.667
- Okay, Mona, Mona, hey--
just breathe.

43:24.736 --> 43:25.902
You are fine.

43:25.971 --> 43:27.670
This has nothing to do
with you personally.

43:27.739 --> 43:29.364
This is not about
your sense of self

43:29.433 --> 43:31.399
or your being
or your worth, even.

43:31.468 --> 43:34.875
You just need to live
in the--look!

43:36.110 --> 43:39.682
I am not your mother.

43:39.751 --> 43:41.816
The casting director's
not your mother.

43:41.885 --> 43:44.687
The director
is not your mother.

43:44.756 --> 43:47.723
Do not get us confused.

43:49.222 --> 43:52.629
You're not under attack.

43:56.031 --> 43:57.700
I don't think

43:57.769 --> 43:59.801
I can do this much longer.

44:05.909 --> 44:08.271
- Well, maybe you shouldn't.

44:08.340 --> 44:12.242
Have you thought
about going back?

44:12.311 --> 44:15.817
Being a minister again?

44:22.321 --> 44:24.353
Mona.

44:32.001 --> 44:35.936
What this world
has to offer you is temporary.

44:38.007 --> 44:43.471
What Jehovah has
for us...

44:43.540 --> 44:44.747
is forever.

44:44.816 --> 44:46.474
- Stop it.
- Mm-mm.

44:46.543 --> 44:47.709
I'm not gonna argue
with you, Mona.

44:47.778 --> 44:51.017
- Me neither.
- We have a meeting tonight.

44:51.086 --> 44:55.824
I am going to get prepared.
You are going to get ready.

45:03.428 --> 45:06.098
Come with me, Mona.

45:07.333 --> 45:09.101
- Right.

45:10.402 --> 45:11.768
Because God forbid

45:11.837 --> 45:14.304
something conflicts with your
fucking meeting, right?

45:14.373 --> 45:16.042
- Okay, we're not gonna have
that type of language

45:16.111 --> 45:17.780
in my house.
- What, what's the problem?

45:17.849 --> 45:19.210
Yes, Mom, I curse now!

45:19.279 --> 45:20.783
- Oh, and how does that
make you feel?

45:20.852 --> 45:22.543
- Great.
I am proud of it, yeah.

45:22.612 --> 45:26.921
I am so proud, and I am done
trying to make you proud of me.

45:26.990 --> 45:28.318
- And how does that
make you feel?

45:28.387 --> 45:29.519
- Oh, it's great.

45:29.588 --> 45:30.654
- Is it great?
- I'm a working actor now.

45:30.723 --> 45:34.060
- Oh, mm-hmm.
- Yeah, on a big TV show.

45:34.129 --> 45:36.425
- You were!

45:36.494 --> 45:38.361
- Right.

45:38.430 --> 45:41.870
But how would you know
since you refused to watch it?

45:41.939 --> 45:43.531
- Oh, I could barely watch
such a horrible show!

45:43.600 --> 45:45.434
- Well, it saved me from you.

45:45.503 --> 45:47.469
- Oh, come to meeting.

45:47.538 --> 45:51.473
Your congregation praying and
crying for you to come back.

45:51.542 --> 45:52.508
- Do you hear yourself?

45:52.576 --> 45:54.377
You always have
to be in control.

45:54.446 --> 45:56.379
It always has to be your way.

45:56.448 --> 45:57.480
- Oh, sounds like
someone I know.

45:57.549 --> 45:59.349
- Even when it is your way,
okay?

45:59.418 --> 46:00.550
Even when I give it to you!

46:00.619 --> 46:01.451
You want me to be
in the full-time ministry,

46:01.520 --> 46:02.886
I become a full-time minister.

46:02.955 --> 46:07.225
That was not enough for you.
I am never enough for you!

46:07.294 --> 46:08.660
- I gave you everything!

46:08.729 --> 46:10.128
I gave you everything
that I could possibly give you,

46:10.197 --> 46:13.495
and now you still come to me
and say that wasn't enough?

46:13.564 --> 46:14.936
What can I do?

46:15.005 --> 46:17.367
- You can love me.

46:19.570 --> 46:22.911
You can love me.

46:22.980 --> 46:26.178
You can love me, Mom.

46:28.920 --> 46:31.546
- Enough.
- No, no!

46:31.615 --> 46:33.515
You don't get to say enough!

46:33.584 --> 46:36.287
You don't get to decide!

46:40.657 --> 46:42.161
- What do you want
from me, Mona?

46:42.230 --> 46:44.559
- Look at me.

46:44.628 --> 46:47.133
Look at me.

46:47.202 --> 46:49.102
Look at me!

46:51.503 --> 46:55.570
My father chose another family,
and my mother chose God,

46:55.639 --> 46:58.243
so what am I supposed to do?

46:58.312 --> 47:00.949
How am I supposed
to walk in the world

47:01.018 --> 47:03.985
when the two people
who are supposed to love me

47:04.054 --> 47:08.121
choose something else?

47:08.190 --> 47:11.190
Hmm?

47:14.724 --> 47:17.196
- I'm so sorry, Mona.

47:17.265 --> 47:21.629
- Oh, G--

47:21.698 --> 47:25.270
- Okay.
Okay.

47:33.578 --> 47:36.248
Okay.

47:52.663 --> 47:55.069
- I think we're done here.

49:09.773 --> 49:13.279
- Just trying to be nice,
you know?

49:13.348 --> 49:14.414
- Sorry?

49:14.482 --> 49:17.316
- What the hell have you
ever been sorry for?

49:25.261 --> 49:28.360
What the hell could you
possibly be so worried about?

49:30.497 --> 49:34.168
You're wearing
a $10,000 Cartier watch.

49:36.140 --> 49:39.239
I don't have anything
in common with you anyway.

49:47.745 --> 49:52.285
What the fuck is taking
so long, man?

49:54.620 --> 49:55.619
God damn!

49:55.688 --> 49:59.061
Does anything fucking work
right anymore?

49:59.130 --> 50:02.394
I got somewhere to be!
I got a meeting!

50:02.463 --> 50:05.199
I'm just fucking with you.
I don't have a meeting.

50:05.268 --> 50:08.268
I don't even have a job.

50:08.337 --> 50:09.797
What about you,
Miss Lonely Heart?

50:09.866 --> 50:12.173
You got a job?

50:46.441 --> 50:47.974
- I believe the money I make
belongs to me and my family,

50:48.043 --> 50:50.574
not some mid-level
government bureaucrat.

50:50.643 --> 50:51.942
This is America, okay?

50:52.011 --> 50:54.215
I think owning a gun
doesn't make me a bad person.

50:54.284 --> 50:55.483
It makes me
a responsible parent,

50:55.552 --> 50:59.121
and I think being
a minority or gay or whatever

50:59.190 --> 51:01.156
doesn't make you
noble or a victim

51:01.225 --> 51:02.718
or entitled to anything.

51:02.787 --> 51:03.919
Sorry.

51:03.988 --> 51:05.821
- Okay.
- No, you know what?

51:05.890 --> 51:08.597
I'm not sorry--there's nothing
wrong with what I'm saying.

51:08.665 --> 51:10.165
There's something wrong
with people who think

51:10.234 --> 51:12.033
there's something wrong
with what I'm saying,

51:12.102 --> 51:14.233
and I'm not just gonna sit
here and let the sick liberal

51:14.301 --> 51:16.336
New York City school system
brainwash my kid

51:16.405 --> 51:17.471
into thinking there's
something wrong with him

51:17.539 --> 51:19.867
just because he's
a white "cisgender male."

51:19.936 --> 51:21.169
No, fuck, no!

51:21.237 --> 51:23.574
- You're rambling.
Explain to me what happened.

51:23.643 --> 51:25.279
- Did I tell you
that one of his classmates

51:25.348 --> 51:26.775
came out as being a lesbian?

51:26.844 --> 51:28.243
- Yeah, so what?
- She's ten years old.

51:28.312 --> 51:30.416
I mean, my kid has to come home
and ask me about things

51:30.485 --> 51:32.318
he's not even old enough
to understand.

51:32.387 --> 51:34.882
I mean, they can't just stick
this shit in my kid's face.

51:34.951 --> 51:38.160
- Did he hurt her?
- What? No.

51:38.229 --> 51:39.392
She just said that
he said something

51:39.461 --> 51:40.723
that made her uncomfortable.

51:40.792 --> 51:42.191
- What'd he say?
- Nothing.

51:42.260 --> 51:45.200
He just repeated something
that some other kids had said,

51:45.269 --> 51:46.602
something stupid
that some kid said.

51:46.670 --> 51:49.336
I mean, kids say stupid things.
That's what kids do.

51:49.405 --> 51:51.437
- Right, but what
was it he said?

51:51.506 --> 51:53.175
- Nothing.
It was a separate incident.

51:53.244 --> 51:54.869
It had nothing to do with it.

51:54.938 --> 51:56.574
- There was more
than one incident?

51:56.643 --> 51:58.741
- No, just two.

51:58.810 --> 51:59.976
- Why was he suspended, Ruth?

52:00.045 --> 52:01.411
- I don't really have
an answer, you know.

52:01.479 --> 52:04.846
I don't--the principal
wouldn't tell us what happened.

52:04.915 --> 52:06.947
The other kid's parents
don't want it to be public.

52:07.016 --> 52:09.620
- Well, what does Jared say
when you ask him what happened?

52:09.689 --> 52:11.919
- He says they were just
horsing around.

52:11.988 --> 52:13.287
I don't know.
He doesn't really remember.

52:13.356 --> 52:16.330
I mean, it's all been
extremely traumatic for him

52:16.399 --> 52:19.498
and for me and David,
all of us.

52:19.567 --> 52:22.633
It would be really nice
if you came over for lunch.

52:23.934 --> 52:26.736
- I got work to do.
- It would mean a lot to Jared.

52:26.805 --> 52:28.309
- Why do I always have
to come to you?

52:28.378 --> 52:29.871
- Because you don't
have children.

52:29.940 --> 52:31.444
- All right,
it's an hour on the train

52:31.513 --> 52:33.710
to get to you and an hour back.

52:33.779 --> 52:35.778
That's two hours of my life
spent in a subway system

52:35.847 --> 52:38.484
that is in total soul-crushing
disrepair and decline.

52:38.553 --> 52:40.849
- Uber--I'll pay for it.
- Thanks.

52:40.918 --> 52:44.325
I'd rather pay some mid-level
government bureaucrat.

52:44.394 --> 52:48.230
Might put that money back
in the city and fix the train.

52:48.299 --> 52:51.761
- It would mean a lot to me.

53:09.683 --> 53:11.451
Hi.
- Hey.

53:11.520 --> 53:14.388
Oh, hey, Mariah.
Hey, crazy girl.

53:14.457 --> 53:17.259
- Mariah Carey, the dog's name
is Mariah Carey.

53:17.328 --> 53:18.627
- I'm not calling her that.

53:18.696 --> 53:19.895
You can't name a black
and white dog Mariah Carey.

53:19.964 --> 53:22.726
- It's an homage.
Come help me set up the table.

53:22.795 --> 53:24.629
- Shame he hung himself.

53:24.698 --> 53:27.929
Poor guy.
What for?

53:27.998 --> 53:29.568
- He always struggled
with depression.

53:29.637 --> 53:30.636
- Depression?

53:30.705 --> 53:33.836
She was sleeping
with half of France.

53:33.905 --> 53:35.541
- Come.
- Hi, Gabe.

53:35.610 --> 53:36.971
- Hi, David.

53:37.040 --> 53:38.273
I can't.

53:38.341 --> 53:41.415
- What, what now?
- Every day it's something new.

53:41.484 --> 53:43.450
- What happened?
- Jared says--comes to me.

53:43.519 --> 53:47.289
He says, "Mommy, did Daddy
make Black people into slaves?"

53:47.358 --> 53:48.686
- It's not funny.

53:48.755 --> 53:50.325
It's actually
pretty depressing.

53:50.394 --> 53:52.657
- Well, what do you say
when he asks you that?

53:52.726 --> 53:56.727
- I tell him no,
Daddy did no such thing.

53:56.796 --> 53:57.893
- That's it?

53:57.962 --> 53:59.295
- What do you mean
that's it?

53:59.363 --> 54:01.567
I tell him, "Don't listen to
what they teach you in school."

54:01.636 --> 54:05.439
So then he says to me,
"Mommy, did I do something bad?

54:05.508 --> 54:07.837
Did I do something bad
to the Blacks?"

54:07.906 --> 54:09.509
- And what do you say to that?

54:09.578 --> 54:12.446
- I tell him, of course, no,
he did nothing wrong.

54:12.515 --> 54:13.942
He has nothing
to be ashamed of.

54:14.011 --> 54:15.581
- Yeah, but do you
explain to him

54:15.650 --> 54:19.585
what he's really asking about,
the history?

54:19.654 --> 54:21.422
- What history?

54:21.491 --> 54:23.391
- You know what history
I'm talking about.

54:23.460 --> 54:24.854
- The one about how
the Great Society destroyed

54:24.923 --> 54:27.989
the Black family--
that history?

54:28.058 --> 54:30.090
Do I talk to him about
how before 1965,

54:30.159 --> 54:32.730
when LBJ started subsidizing
single mothers,

54:32.799 --> 54:34.732
the out-of-wedlock birth rate
among Black people in America

54:34.801 --> 54:36.965
was at 20%
and that now it's at 70%?

54:37.034 --> 54:39.671
- Where do you get this shit?
- I do talk to him about that.

54:39.740 --> 54:41.409
- You talk--you talk
about out-of-wedlock birth

54:41.478 --> 54:42.707
with your ten-year-old?

54:42.776 --> 54:43.942
- I don't have to
defend myself.

54:44.011 --> 54:46.513
I don't have a problem
with anyone, gay, Black.

54:46.582 --> 54:49.010
I named my dog Mariah Carey
because I love Mariah Carey,

54:49.079 --> 54:51.617
and I'm pretty sure my dog
is gay, and I love my dog.

54:51.686 --> 54:54.785
What I have a problem with
is everyone telling me

54:54.854 --> 54:56.853
how bad my son is, everything
that's wrong with him.

54:56.922 --> 54:58.789
- He's just--

54:58.858 --> 55:02.056
he's hearing different things
in here and out there,

55:02.125 --> 55:04.861
and--and that's clearly
confusing him.

55:04.930 --> 55:05.962
That's causing him to lash out,

55:06.031 --> 55:07.564
and--and that's alienating him
from people.

55:07.633 --> 55:10.900
- It is not my fault that right
now we're living in this moment

55:10.969 --> 55:15.377
of groupthink social justice
fucking warrior mob nonsense.

55:15.446 --> 55:16.679
- Groupthink?

55:16.747 --> 55:18.039
- And that that's what
the school is teaching.

55:18.108 --> 55:19.207
That is not my fault.

55:19.276 --> 55:21.141
- So he was suspended
from school for two days

55:21.210 --> 55:22.342
because of groupthink?

55:24.521 --> 55:26.014
- Why do you have empathy
for everyone in the world

55:26.083 --> 55:28.951
except for me?

55:29.020 --> 55:31.723
- Why do you care what I think?

55:31.792 --> 55:33.857
- Do you hate me?

55:33.926 --> 55:35.727
- Why would you say that?

55:46.169 --> 55:47.970
- If you think you have
all the answers,

55:48.039 --> 55:49.136
why don't you go talk to him?

55:49.205 --> 55:50.204
He's upstairs.

55:54.518 --> 55:57.419
Just try to keep your agenda
out of it, okay?

55:57.488 --> 56:01.082
Just try to make it about him?

56:04.055 --> 56:05.691
- I just landed in a ship,

56:05.760 --> 56:07.093
and this guy
was, like, a snowman.

56:07.161 --> 56:08.925
There's another one.
See, that's what it looks like.

56:08.994 --> 56:10.124
And then--oh, that one.

56:10.193 --> 56:12.995
Great, yes.

56:13.064 --> 56:14.163
Too close, too close.

56:14.232 --> 56:17.967
There's a guy up there.
There's a guy.

56:18.036 --> 56:20.871
Hey, are you a pescatarian?

56:20.940 --> 56:23.038
- I am.

56:23.107 --> 56:25.645
- Why?

56:25.714 --> 56:27.845
- I just don't like
to eat meat.

56:31.247 --> 56:33.180
- How come you don't have
a girlfriend?

56:36.692 --> 56:38.922
My mom says it's because
you don't have a job.

56:38.991 --> 56:42.057
I think it's because
you're better than everyone.

56:42.126 --> 56:43.828
- You're a good kid, Jared.

56:43.897 --> 56:48.162
- That's not what my English
teacher says.

56:48.231 --> 56:49.801
- Yeah?

56:49.870 --> 56:52.738
What does
your English teacher say?

56:52.807 --> 56:55.939
- My English teacher's
just terrible.

56:56.008 --> 56:57.875
- Why--why is your
English teacher terrible?

56:57.944 --> 56:59.910
- Just...

56:59.979 --> 57:03.111
He's inappropriate,
very inappropriate.

57:03.180 --> 57:07.522
- In what way?
- The way he acts.

57:07.591 --> 57:09.623
- How's he act?
- He talks.

57:09.692 --> 57:12.857
Like, it's weird--
whoa, whoa.

57:12.926 --> 57:17.598
- What--what's weird
about the way he talks?

57:17.667 --> 57:19.864
- He's, like, really gay.

57:21.704 --> 57:24.000
Go, go.
- Oh.

57:24.069 --> 57:26.904
- He sits with his,
like, legs crossed.

57:26.973 --> 57:31.172
Oh!
- I-I see.

57:31.241 --> 57:34.846
- Why's he have
to act like that?

57:34.915 --> 57:36.782
- Um...

57:36.851 --> 57:40.049
- Why does he have to stick
that in our faces? Gross.

57:40.118 --> 57:43.624
Also, he's, like, Black, so
it's, you know, even weirder.

57:43.693 --> 57:45.659
- Hey.

57:45.728 --> 57:48.992
- Zone, zone, zone.
Zone, zone, zone!

57:49.061 --> 57:51.060
- Hey, Jared--
- Behind these trees--

57:51.129 --> 57:52.534
- Jared.
- What?

57:52.603 --> 57:53.766
- It's okay.
- Where'd he go?

57:53.835 --> 57:56.934
- You can talk to me.
-

57:57.003 --> 57:58.771
He sent me
to the principal's office.

57:58.840 --> 58:00.872
- Why'd he send you
to the principal's office?

58:00.941 --> 58:03.138
- He hates me.

58:03.207 --> 58:05.943
Everyone at school hates me.

58:06.012 --> 58:08.913
- Why don't--
- I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.

58:08.982 --> 58:10.684
- Why don't you tell me
what happened?

58:10.753 --> 58:11.986
- I don't really remember.

58:12.054 --> 58:16.283
- Jared, what did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

58:16.352 --> 58:17.823
- How do you know you
didn't do anything--

58:17.892 --> 58:18.824
How do you know
you didn't do anything

58:18.893 --> 58:20.092
if you don't remember
what happened?

58:20.161 --> 58:22.564
- Oh, someone's there!
Someone's there! Yes!

58:22.633 --> 58:23.866
- All right, all right, Jared.
- Eliminated.

58:23.934 --> 58:25.600
There's another guy behind me.
There's another guy.

58:25.669 --> 58:28.064
- Jared, look at me.

58:28.133 --> 58:31.001
- Don't hate me, Gabe.

58:31.070 --> 58:33.938
- Lunch is ready.

58:34.007 --> 58:36.644
- No!
He was right behind me.

58:36.713 --> 58:40.076
Mom, he was right behind me.
I could have killed him!

58:40.145 --> 58:42.078
I could have killed him!

59:01.903 --> 59:04.298
- So, Gabe,
what's new with you?

59:04.367 --> 59:07.741
- I'm making a documentary.

59:07.810 --> 59:11.041
- What about?
- Police brutality.

59:11.110 --> 59:13.076
- Oh, boy.

59:16.181 --> 59:17.347
Easy, now.

59:17.416 --> 59:20.347
Can we maybe not talk
about politics for once?

59:20.416 --> 59:22.250
- Actually meeting
a regional organizer

59:22.319 --> 59:23.955
for Black Lives Matter
tomorrow.

59:24.024 --> 59:25.990
- Oh.

59:27.456 --> 59:30.027
- How's that feel?

59:30.096 --> 59:31.864
- How's what feel?

59:31.933 --> 59:33.393
- Being
a cultural appropriator.

59:33.462 --> 59:35.329
Touché.

59:35.398 --> 59:36.935
- See, this is what
your side loves to do.

59:37.004 --> 59:38.266
You avoid dealing
with the message

59:38.335 --> 59:39.467
by bullying the messenger.

59:39.536 --> 59:41.401
- Black Lives Matter
is a racist message.

59:41.470 --> 59:42.736
- All lives matter.

59:42.805 --> 59:44.173
- Yeah, Gabe, why don't you
make a movie about that?

59:44.242 --> 59:45.944
Mariah Carey, no.

59:46.013 --> 59:48.749
- Can I make that one?
- Yeah, might as well.

59:48.818 --> 59:50.652
- It's just so adversarial,

59:50.721 --> 59:52.753
as if our lives don't matter.

59:52.822 --> 59:54.986
Hey, hey, hey!
- Down!

59:55.055 --> 59:57.758
Mariah Carey.
Mariah Carey, down, down.

59:57.827 --> 59:59.727
- No one's saying your life
doesn't matter, David.

59:59.796 --> 1:00:01.029
- It's just bad marketing.

1:00:01.097 --> 1:00:03.665
- Unarmed innocent people
keep getting killed by cops,

1:00:03.734 --> 1:00:04.900
and you're talking
about marketing.

1:00:04.969 --> 1:00:07.229
- Who's innocent?
- Oscar Grant was innocent.

1:00:07.298 --> 1:00:08.297
- Oscar Grant had a record,

1:00:08.366 --> 1:00:09.498
illegal possession
of a handgun.

1:00:09.567 --> 1:00:11.066
Don't tell me
these people are innocent.

1:00:11.135 --> 1:00:14.005
- He was shot in the back lying
facedown on a subway platform.

1:00:14.074 --> 1:00:16.711
- It was a freak accident.
- Except it keeps happening.

1:00:16.780 --> 1:00:18.075
Trayvon Martin was also
a freak accident?

1:00:18.144 --> 1:00:19.510
- Trayvon Martin
wasn't killed by a cop.

1:00:19.579 --> 1:00:22.816
He was killed by an idiot.
- Tamir Rice, Eric Garner--

1:00:22.885 --> 1:00:23.884
- Eric Garner is dead
because he was selling

1:00:23.953 --> 1:00:26.347
untaxed cigarettes
and resisting arrest.

1:00:26.416 --> 1:00:27.887
The guy was the size
of a Mack truck.

1:00:27.956 --> 1:00:29.790
It took five cops
to restrain him.

1:00:29.859 --> 1:00:31.092
How could anyone know
that he had asthma?

1:00:31.160 --> 1:00:33.695
- Because he was screaming,
"I can't breathe."

1:00:33.764 --> 1:00:35.063
- See,
even the marketing there,

1:00:35.132 --> 1:00:37.798
the "I can't breathe" shirts,
it's just so accusatory,

1:00:37.867 --> 1:00:38.999
pointing a finger at me

1:00:39.068 --> 1:00:40.702
as if I was the one
who was choking him.

1:00:40.771 --> 1:00:41.670
- You keep--
- Down.

1:00:41.739 --> 1:00:43.837
- You keep talking
about marketing.

1:00:43.906 --> 1:00:45.305
- Well, because it is marketing

1:00:45.374 --> 1:00:48.171
that is driving the culture
wars in this country, Gabe.

1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:50.371
- We created the conditions
in these neighborhoods,

1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:51.739
and then we send cops to them,

1:00:51.808 --> 1:00:52.874
and you sit here and defend
them when they kill a kid

1:00:52.942 --> 1:00:54.242
that could just as well
have been yours,

1:00:54.311 --> 1:00:56.550
and that makes you complicit,
so yes, yes, David,

1:00:56.619 --> 1:00:57.751
the marketing is pointing
a finger at you.

1:00:57.820 --> 1:01:00.986
- Okay, we didn't create
these conditions, Gabe.

1:01:01.055 --> 1:01:04.187
We're Jewish.
We came from ghettos, too.

1:01:04.256 --> 1:01:06.090
- Jews enjoy the privileges
of being white.

1:01:06.159 --> 1:01:07.558
- Only in New York.

1:01:07.627 --> 1:01:09.896
- What's happening is that
people like you and the media

1:01:09.965 --> 1:01:12.228
are using people like
Eric Garner,

1:01:12.297 --> 1:01:14.494
isolated incidents,
to justify your agenda.

1:01:14.563 --> 1:01:16.771
- Freddie Gray
was an isolated incident?

1:01:16.840 --> 1:01:18.399
Mike Brown was
an isolated incident?

1:01:18.468 --> 1:01:19.667
- Freddie Gray had a knife.

1:01:19.736 --> 1:01:23.437
Mike Brown was fighting a cop
over control of a gun.

1:01:23.506 --> 1:01:25.208
If you do that,
you might get shot.

1:01:25.277 --> 1:01:28.750
- 12 times?
Unarmed kid shot 12 times?

1:01:28.819 --> 1:01:30.213
- Okay, relax.
- Don't tell me to relax.

1:01:30.282 --> 1:01:31.753
- I just don't think that
you're appreciating

1:01:31.822 --> 1:01:33.121
how difficult it is
to be a policeman

1:01:33.190 --> 1:01:34.921
in these neighborhoods.
- Try being Black in them.

1:01:34.990 --> 1:01:36.252
- Because you would know.

1:01:36.321 --> 1:01:37.891
- We know what it's like to be

1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:39.255
part of a persecuted minority.

1:01:39.324 --> 1:01:41.026
- Yes, which is exactly why

1:01:41.095 --> 1:01:43.094
we, of all people,
should understand.

1:01:43.163 --> 1:01:46.328
- Gabe, we picked ourselves up
as a people

1:01:46.397 --> 1:01:47.563
because of strong family values

1:01:47.632 --> 1:01:49.496
and a culture
that prioritizes education,

1:01:49.565 --> 1:01:51.498
not because we said
our lives matter.

1:01:51.567 --> 1:01:52.906
- When these kids are
playing basketball,

1:01:52.975 --> 1:01:54.007
my kid is doing his homework.

1:01:54.076 --> 1:01:56.305
- Okay, I don't even--
That's just racist.

1:01:56.374 --> 1:01:58.978
- Oh, my God, racist, really?
- Racist--that's not racist.

1:01:59.047 --> 1:02:01.112
- First of all, there's nothing
wrong with playing basketball.

1:02:01.181 --> 1:02:02.480
- You're gonna play
the race card?

1:02:02.549 --> 1:02:05.050
- Second, you're not taking
into account the history.

1:02:05.119 --> 1:02:07.019
- There's your history,
and there's my history.

1:02:07.088 --> 1:02:08.449
- You're a numbers guy,
right, David?

1:02:08.518 --> 1:02:09.550
- Sure.

1:02:09.619 --> 1:02:10.918
- Kid born in
a poor neighborhood

1:02:10.987 --> 1:02:13.861
with high levels of crime
is less likely to go to college

1:02:13.930 --> 1:02:16.061
and more likely to end up
in jail or shot by a cop

1:02:16.130 --> 1:02:17.524
than a kid born
in this neighborhood.

1:02:17.593 --> 1:02:18.625
- The Black people
who work for me,

1:02:18.694 --> 1:02:19.960
they would be so annoyed
by this argument.

1:02:20.029 --> 1:02:23.167
- They're more likely to end up
in jail or shot by a cop

1:02:23.236 --> 1:02:25.466
than a kid born
in this neighborhood,

1:02:25.535 --> 1:02:26.634
than a kid born in this house.

1:02:26.703 --> 1:02:28.205
That has nothing to do
with your family values.

1:02:28.274 --> 1:02:29.406
That's--that's just math.

1:02:29.475 --> 1:02:30.641
- There's your math,
and there's my math.

1:02:30.710 --> 1:02:32.946
- No, there's not--
you can't have your own math,

1:02:33.015 --> 1:02:35.179
your own history,
fucking alternative facts.

1:02:35.248 --> 1:02:36.950
What's the point of even trying
to fucking talk about it?

1:02:37.019 --> 1:02:38.252
- Don't curse
in front of my kid.

1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:40.481
- Right, cursing,
because that's his problem.

1:02:40.550 --> 1:02:41.783
- What do you know
about problems?

1:02:41.851 --> 1:02:44.254
You generate no income.
You're responsible to no one.

1:02:44.323 --> 1:02:46.355
- I have an income, but it's
not your kind of income.

1:02:46.424 --> 1:02:47.823
I volunteer.

1:02:47.892 --> 1:02:49.125
I'm responsible to people,
just not your kind of people.

1:02:49.193 --> 1:02:50.459
- Oh, we should put a statue
of you up in Central Park.

1:02:50.528 --> 1:02:52.900
Why don't we knock down
the one of Christopher Columbus

1:02:52.969 --> 1:02:53.868
and put one of you instead?

1:02:53.937 --> 1:02:54.969
- My teacher says

1:02:55.038 --> 1:02:56.237
Christopher Columbus
was a bad man.

1:02:56.306 --> 1:02:57.238
- Your teacher's right.
- Ignore your uncle.

1:02:57.307 --> 1:02:59.271
- Stop it.
- He's my brother,

1:02:59.339 --> 1:03:00.405
and I love him,
but he's a loser,

1:03:00.474 --> 1:03:01.440
and these ideas
encourage him to be one.

1:03:01.508 --> 1:03:03.339
- I'd rather be a loser
than a bigot.

1:03:03.408 --> 1:03:04.340
- Go upstairs, Jared.

1:03:04.409 --> 1:03:05.174
- You should hear
some of the things

1:03:05.243 --> 1:03:06.409
he was saying to me upstairs.

1:03:06.478 --> 1:03:08.742
- What do you mean?
What were you saying?

1:03:08.810 --> 1:03:10.984
- Seriously, what do you
have him reading, "Mein Kampf"?

1:03:11.053 --> 1:03:13.514
- Loser.
- I'm a loser?

1:03:13.583 --> 1:03:14.615
You talk about money

1:03:14.684 --> 1:03:15.917
as if you've ever made any--
get a job.

1:03:15.985 --> 1:03:19.586
- I'm raising a child.
Raising a child is a job, Gabe.

1:03:19.655 --> 1:03:21.863
- Guys!

1:03:21.932 --> 1:03:23.359
- How does it feel, Gabe?

1:03:23.428 --> 1:03:25.559
How does it feel to be
a complete disappointment?

1:03:25.628 --> 1:03:26.727
- Well, you didn't turn out

1:03:26.796 --> 1:03:27.962
the way you were
supposed to either, so...

1:03:28.030 --> 1:03:29.196
- Is that why you don't
have a girlfriend?

1:03:29.265 --> 1:03:31.532
- Okay, enough.
- Because you're a faggot?

1:03:31.601 --> 1:03:33.204
- Jared.
- Jared.

1:03:34.340 --> 1:03:35.910
Jesus!

1:03:35.979 --> 1:03:38.539
Are you serious?

1:03:38.608 --> 1:03:40.442
Get out!
Now!

1:03:40.511 --> 1:03:43.214
Get the fuck out of here!
Let me see your face.

1:03:43.283 --> 1:03:45.986
Oh, my God, are you bleeding?
Let's go upstairs, come on.

1:03:46.055 --> 1:03:48.087
Come on, you'll be okay.

1:03:48.156 --> 1:03:49.517
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:04:16.580 --> 1:04:19.448
- Okay.

1:04:19.517 --> 1:04:21.615
Sit down.

1:04:21.684 --> 1:04:25.454
It's a little cold.
Let me see it.

1:04:25.523 --> 1:04:28.424
Oh, God.
Oh.

1:04:28.493 --> 1:04:31.064
It's still pretty red.

1:04:31.133 --> 1:04:34.628
Does it still hurt?

1:04:34.697 --> 1:04:35.963
- Yeah.

1:04:36.032 --> 1:04:40.271
- Okay, I'm gonna go
get you something for the pain.

1:04:45.543 --> 1:04:47.443
- Mom.

1:04:49.151 --> 1:04:53.086
- Tell me right now.

1:04:53.155 --> 1:04:55.352
- What?

1:04:55.421 --> 1:04:58.091
- What happened?

1:04:58.160 --> 1:04:59.686
- What are you talking about?

1:04:59.755 --> 1:05:02.227
- I don't want to hear
you don't remember.

1:05:02.296 --> 1:05:05.362
- But I don't.

1:05:05.431 --> 1:05:09.267
- Tell me right now, or you're
never playing "Fortnite" again.

1:05:14.572 --> 1:05:16.109
- Mom!

1:05:22.085 --> 1:05:24.986
- You better tell me
what happened, Jared,

1:05:25.055 --> 1:05:27.417
and it better be the truth.

1:05:28.718 --> 1:05:30.959
- Mom, I'm scared.

1:05:43.568 --> 1:05:46.337
- Um...

1:05:57.813 --> 1:06:01.055
Where are you going?

1:06:01.124 --> 1:06:03.024
- To see my brother.

1:19:31.164 --> 1:19:33.559
- Hello?

1:19:33.628 --> 1:19:35.935
Hello?

1:27:26.771 --> 1:27:28.308
- Aah!

1:33:55.159 --> 1:33:57.895
Huh?

1:37:40.318 --> 1:37:43.384
- We used to do patrol
in the morning in Kabul.

1:37:43.453 --> 1:37:45.320
And the rule is, like,
whoever's driving

1:37:45.389 --> 1:37:46.585
got to pick the music.

1:37:46.654 --> 1:37:50.193
And, uh,
I had this buddy Booth.

1:37:50.262 --> 1:37:53.691
He was from Little Rock,
Black dude.

1:37:53.760 --> 1:37:56.199
He would play, like...

1:37:56.268 --> 1:37:58.498
like, Masta Ace and Goodie Mob.

1:37:58.567 --> 1:38:01.369
Some Wu-Tang.
That was good.

1:38:03.374 --> 1:38:05.978
Wu-Tang is good driving
around...

1:38:06.047 --> 1:38:07.914
and shooting.

1:38:18.125 --> 1:38:20.454
Hey, you know, I'm just
trying to be a nice guy.

1:38:20.523 --> 1:38:23.127
You don't have to be all, like,
"ugh," about it, you know?

1:38:34.075 --> 1:38:36.107
You know, I can tell
you have no clue who I am,

1:38:36.176 --> 1:38:38.175
but you don't have
to ignore people.

1:38:40.576 --> 1:38:43.642
You know, even if
I'm just somebody or nobody,

1:38:43.711 --> 1:38:45.710
like, today's Mr. So-and-So

1:38:45.779 --> 1:38:48.152
could be
a big deal tomorrow.

1:38:52.588 --> 1:38:54.521
The tables turn pretty fast
in this world,

1:38:54.590 --> 1:38:56.226
you know what I mean?

1:39:09.176 --> 1:39:12.176
I'm just trying to be nice,
you know?

1:39:12.245 --> 1:39:14.211
- Sorry?

1:39:26.424 --> 1:39:28.225
- What the hell have you
ever been sorry for?

1:39:28.294 --> 1:39:30.260
- I beg--I beg your pardon?

1:39:35.268 --> 1:39:38.136
- What the hell are you
so worried about?

1:39:38.205 --> 1:39:41.007
You're wearing
a $10,000 Cartier watch.

1:39:51.713 --> 1:39:54.383
I don't have anything
in common with you anyway.

1:39:59.193 --> 1:40:02.160
What the fuck
is taking so long, man?

1:40:04.462 --> 1:40:06.164
God damn!

1:40:06.233 --> 1:40:08.496
I got to be somewhere!

1:40:08.565 --> 1:40:11.136
This is taking forever!

1:40:11.205 --> 1:40:13.798
Does anything fucking work
right anymore?

1:40:13.867 --> 1:40:16.702
I got somewhere to be!
I got a meeting!

1:40:21.743 --> 1:40:23.478
I'm just fucking with you.
I don't have anywhere to be.

1:40:23.547 --> 1:40:26.580
I don't have a meeting.
I don't even have a job.

1:40:30.323 --> 1:40:31.783
Hey, what about you there,
Miss Lonely Heart?

1:40:31.852 --> 1:40:33.752
You got a job?

1:40:37.363 --> 1:40:39.626
You remind me
a lot of my mother.

1:40:52.774 --> 1:40:55.741
It's okay.
I get it.

1:40:55.810 --> 1:40:58.183
You're a sick puppy,
aren't you?

1:41:02.256 --> 1:41:05.190
I'm a sick puppy, too.

1:41:07.921 --> 1:41:12.494
That's why
I'm gonna spare you...

1:41:12.563 --> 1:41:15.530
even though you are
pretty fucking ungrateful.

1:41:19.504 --> 1:41:21.239
Hey, guess what.

1:41:25.609 --> 1:41:27.278
I'm so fucking full of love,
I feel like--

1:41:27.347 --> 1:41:29.379
- He's got a gun!
- Whoa!

1:42:22.534 --> 1:42:26.700
meant to be

1:43:12.551 --> 1:43:18.224
too slow

1:44:17.781 --> 1:44:22.046
meant to be

1:44:52.420 --> 1:44:57.455
over me
