01:38.390 --> 01:40.990
Heave the starboard line!

01:43.710 --> 01:45.270
Heave the port line.

01:49.870 --> 01:52.710
Make fast starboard line.

01:58.590 --> 02:01.790
Hi. Looks like
more passengers this trip.

02:01.870 --> 02:05.190
Keep your fingers crossed.
We may have some luck.

02:10.470 --> 02:13.590
- What did you say?
- Pardon. The boat sails at 4:00.

02:13.630 --> 02:14.870
Hi, Rafael.

02:16.990 --> 02:19.230
Here you are.
Two sacks this time.

02:19.310 --> 02:22.510
- How's the talent this trip?
- Very bad.

02:22.590 --> 02:24.830
- Not much to choose from, huh?
- You can have my shares.

02:24.910 --> 02:28.510
- This all you've got on board?
- There's not one you'd give that for.

02:33.230 --> 02:35.590
Wait a minute!
Look at that!

02:35.670 --> 02:38.470
- What a pretty mouse!
- Who hung that on you?

02:38.550 --> 02:43.630
Oh, no. We have had some bad weather.
I fell against a doorknob.

02:43.710 --> 02:46.430
You oughta cut its fingernails.

02:48.990 --> 02:52.310
- Boat leaves at 4:00 in the morning.
- I'll be here.

03:00.870 --> 03:04.430
- I thought you said...
- You chump. That's the doorknob.

03:04.510 --> 03:06.470
We've got work to do.

03:08.350 --> 03:10.310
Be careful, boys.

03:43.910 --> 03:46.150
Wait a minute.
Take it easy.

04:51.790 --> 04:55.510
- There's a strong character for you.
- Probably the wrong approach.

04:55.550 --> 04:57.990
- Come on, we'll try again.
- Easy does it.

05:06.950 --> 05:09.150
- Lady, we've decided to appeal to...
- What?

05:09.230 --> 05:11.430
It wasn't me, lady.
He thought it up by himself.

05:11.510 --> 05:15.270
- We were just gonna buy you a drink.
- Are you Americans?

05:15.350 --> 05:18.110
I thought you were a couple of...

05:18.150 --> 05:22.150
Gee-willikers! Why didn't you say so?
I'm gonna buy you a drink!

05:22.230 --> 05:25.510
- Then you won't need this.
- Come on.

05:25.590 --> 05:30.030
Sure good to hear something that doesn't
sound like pig latin. Where're you from?

05:30.110 --> 05:33.030
He's Les Peters and I'm Joe Souther.
New York and Kansas.

05:33.110 --> 05:34.950
- What's your name?
- Lee.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.270
- Lee what?
- Bonnie Lee from Brooklyn.

05:37.310 --> 05:38.550
Look out.

05:48.190 --> 05:50.790
- What was that?
- Fifth Avenue bus line.

05:54.390 --> 05:56.350
Too bad you didn't break your neck.

05:56.430 --> 05:58.510
Who saw her first?

06:02.990 --> 06:05.110
Here you are, Dutchy.

06:05.150 --> 06:07.470
- Meet Miss Lee.
- How do you do?

06:07.550 --> 06:12.030
Miss Lee, this imposing gentleman is
the postmaster and banker of Barranca.

06:12.110 --> 06:13.950
I've always wanted...

06:14.030 --> 06:16.670
Also the owner of this general store
on your right...

06:16.750 --> 06:19.590
proprietor of the bar on your left...

06:19.670 --> 06:24.830
and chief cook and bottle washer
of this hotel and restaurant you see.

06:24.910 --> 06:26.830
That hardly seems enough, Mr...

06:26.910 --> 06:30.190
John Vanrider is the name.
Please don't pay any attention to...

06:30.270 --> 06:32.350
- How 'bout a drink?
- Sure! Sit down.

06:32.430 --> 06:36.030
Make yourself at home.
What are you going to have?

06:36.110 --> 06:38.750
- How's the local Scotch?
- I carry only the best, eh, boys?

06:38.830 --> 06:41.150
- Make mine bourbon.
- Me, too.

06:41.190 --> 06:42.590
Well me, too.

06:42.630 --> 06:45.310
My Scotch is good.
I drink it myself.

06:45.390 --> 06:47.230
Why don't you have one with us?

06:47.310 --> 06:49.150
I will.

06:49.190 --> 06:52.990
Does it seem good
to be off that boat!

06:55.790 --> 06:58.350
What are you looking at?
What's the matter with me?

06:58.430 --> 07:01.310
Nothing.
You're sure easy on the eyes.

07:01.390 --> 07:03.870
You mug! You heard me use that
two weeks ago.

07:03.950 --> 07:07.470
It still sounds good.
What are you fellas doing down here?

07:07.550 --> 07:10.430
Same as everybody else,
working for the Dutchman.

07:10.510 --> 07:13.590
- What's that?
- We fly mail and things here and there.

07:13.670 --> 07:17.030
Fliers! I was wondering why
you were carrying those guns.

07:17.110 --> 07:19.870
Do you think we're a couple
of banana cowboys?

07:19.910 --> 07:23.910
- Where's the flying field down here?
- Right outside the door.

07:23.990 --> 07:27.150
- Skoal!
- To us.

07:27.230 --> 07:29.590
- Down the hatch.
- Happy landings.

07:32.230 --> 07:35.350
What are you doing down here?
On your way back to the States?

07:35.430 --> 07:38.270
- Yep, if I don't get a job in Panama.
- A professional!

07:38.310 --> 07:40.670
I quit a show at Valparaiso.
These are on me.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.710
- Don't do that.
- I said I wanted to buy you a drink.

07:43.790 --> 07:47.510
- I'm paying for these.
- You better let him pay.

07:47.550 --> 07:52.150
Wait a minute. If you take his money,
I'll never step foot in this place.

07:52.230 --> 07:54.230
Joe, where are you going to eat?

07:54.270 --> 07:56.350
I'll starve, but I won't
come in here again.

07:56.430 --> 07:58.390
I better take his money.

07:58.430 --> 08:01.390
If you take his money, I'll never
come in again. Who asked first?

08:01.470 --> 08:04.390
- I'm going to pay.
- He asked first.

08:04.470 --> 08:06.630
- I meant what I said.
- So did I.

08:06.710 --> 08:08.070
Where you...

08:08.150 --> 08:11.790
The drinks are on the house!
Satisfied?

08:12.830 --> 08:15.230
- Very well satisfied.
- That's a shame. He's so cute.

08:15.310 --> 08:18.150
Dutchy, come on back.
No more monkey business.

08:18.230 --> 08:20.630
- Bring a bottle.
- No, you better take it easy.

08:20.670 --> 08:23.350
- What for?
- One of you has to fly the mail tonight.

08:23.430 --> 08:26.790
- I thought Tony was first out.
- Tony has a touch of fever.

08:26.870 --> 08:31.030
- It's either you or Joe.
- Can you beat that?

08:31.070 --> 08:32.950
Dutchy, pick a number.

08:32.990 --> 08:35.190
- What for?
- Anything up to ten.

08:35.230 --> 08:37.750
One to ten? Number?

08:38.750 --> 08:41.429
Oh, no. Not me.

08:41.510 --> 08:45.590
If you want to gamble on who goes up
in that weather, pick someone else.

08:45.630 --> 08:48.550
- All right, Bonnie.
- Anything up to ten.

08:48.630 --> 08:51.030
Not me.
I feel the same way he does.

08:51.110 --> 08:54.070
Nobody's worrying about who's going up.
We're worrying about...

08:54.150 --> 08:57.190
Who's gonna take you to dinner.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.110
Who said anything about staying
for dinner?

08:59.190 --> 09:02.230
We'll send you a formal invitation.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.270
Les, odd or even?

09:06.430 --> 09:07.830
Odd.

09:09.270 --> 09:11.110
That's too bad.

09:11.190 --> 09:14.070
Well, Bonnie,
how do you like your steak?

09:14.110 --> 09:16.510
I don't know if...

09:16.550 --> 09:18.750
You mean real American steak?

09:18.830 --> 09:23.310
I don't want to brag, but how do
you think I keep those boys down here?

09:23.390 --> 09:26.590
- I guess I'm staying for dinner.
- That's the girl!

09:26.670 --> 09:30.190
Why do I always say "odd,"
and it always comes out...

09:33.190 --> 09:35.750
I hate that noise.

09:37.150 --> 09:41.110
Joe Souther,
you're up next.

09:41.150 --> 09:44.190
- That's you, Les.
- Joe Souther.

09:45.230 --> 09:47.190
Sorry, kid.

09:49.030 --> 09:51.670
Joe, stand by.
Tex says it's clearing.

09:51.750 --> 09:56.030
Not me. Les lost.
I'm having dinner with Miss Lee.

09:56.110 --> 09:58.350
- Miss Lee, Mr. Carter.
- How do you do?

09:58.430 --> 10:00.070
Hello, Miss Lee.

10:00.150 --> 10:02.910
Sorry, Joe, but the mail goes out
on schedule. So do the pilots.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.630
Since when, Geoff?

10:04.710 --> 10:08.510
I want Les to check over that stuff
that came in on the boat today.

10:08.550 --> 10:11.390
- When did you think that up?
- Just now.

10:12.350 --> 10:15.910
Geoff, the boys gambled and he lost.
Let him go.

10:17.110 --> 10:20.990
- Is that an order?
- Yeah! No, no...

10:21.070 --> 10:23.270
Who is running things here anyway?

10:23.350 --> 10:26.990
- That's what I mean. Joe, get going.
- Miss Lee and I were having dinner.

10:27.070 --> 10:29.750
Don't worry about Miss Lee.
I'll take up where you left off.

10:29.790 --> 10:34.110
Look here, mister.
I've got something to say about this.

10:34.190 --> 10:35.670
Chorus girl?

10:35.710 --> 10:38.110
No, I do a specialty.

10:40.150 --> 10:43.110
So much the better. Pick up that stuff
on your way back from Las Cruces.

10:43.190 --> 10:47.230
- See you later, Miss Lee.
- You will, will you? I might have...

10:50.230 --> 10:53.230
Who does that guy think he is?

10:53.310 --> 10:55.430
- That's the boss.
- As you may have gathered.

10:55.510 --> 10:59.870
- He's not my boss and...
- Bonnie, I hope you win.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.830
- I'll be seein' ya.
- Good-bye, Joe.

11:01.910 --> 11:04.150
Be careful. No chances.

11:04.190 --> 11:08.790
- Dutchy, find something to worry about.
- That's what you should be doing.

11:14.310 --> 11:16.470
Hi, Lily.

11:23.270 --> 11:25.670
I've got to go.
I'll be back soon.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.510
- So long.
- Bye, darling.

11:33.630 --> 11:35.670
How can he fly in this fog?

11:35.750 --> 11:39.830
It's just on the ground. He'll pull up
through it. Only 200, 300 feet thick.

11:39.910 --> 11:43.150
What he's waiting for is the heavy stuff
farther up in the pass.

11:43.230 --> 11:46.070
- Sounds like double-talk.
- I guess it does.

11:46.150 --> 11:48.990
The only way inland from here
is through a deep pass.

11:49.030 --> 11:51.230
It's up...
You can't see it.

11:51.310 --> 11:55.070
It's 14,000 feet at the low spot.
Wind and clouds make it a bad place.

11:55.110 --> 11:57.950
That's why we keep a lookout part way
through to tell us when it clears.

11:58.030 --> 11:59.990
Calling Barranca.

12:00.070 --> 12:01.470
Here it comes.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.190
Go ahead, Tex.

12:03.230 --> 12:05.950
Stand by. She's moving fast.
How's it look down there?

12:06.030 --> 12:07.870
All right if the wind doesn't shift.

12:07.950 --> 12:10.270
Hold on.
I'll take a look outside.

12:15.550 --> 12:18.710
Big breaks now.
This looks like the last of it.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.630
Okay, she's open.

12:20.670 --> 12:22.070
Let 'em fly!

13:04.150 --> 13:07.310
Oh, it's the most wonderful thing
I've ever seen.

13:07.390 --> 13:10.830
Yes. Reminded you of a great big
beautiful bird, didn't it?

13:10.910 --> 13:13.590
No, it didn't.
That's why it's so wonderful.

13:13.630 --> 13:15.670
It's really a flying human being.

13:17.910 --> 13:21.430
You're right about one thing. A bird
has too much sense to fly in that muck.

13:25.790 --> 13:28.550
Joe Souther.
Calling Joe Souther.

13:28.630 --> 13:31.070
Go ahead, Geoff.

13:31.150 --> 13:34.710
- Radio check. One. Two. Three. Four...
- Four. Five. Six.

13:34.750 --> 13:37.750
Seven. Eight.
Clear as a bell, Papa.

13:37.830 --> 13:41.070
On top at 400 between layers.

13:41.150 --> 13:46.430
Geoff, there's a heavy fog bank
laying off the coast. Anything else?

13:46.510 --> 13:49.350
No, that's all.
All right, Joe.

14:04.990 --> 14:06.710
Hi, Les.

14:08.110 --> 14:10.070
- Geoff.
- Hello, Kid.

14:10.150 --> 14:13.030
The wind's swung around.
It's bringing that fog bank in.

14:13.110 --> 14:15.230
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:19.470 --> 14:21.910
Calling Lookout. Calling Lookout.
How much time?

14:21.950 --> 14:24.030
- Better move fast.
- Go ahead, Geoff.

14:24.110 --> 14:26.950
- How's it look up there?
- I was going to call. Better hold Joe.

14:27.030 --> 14:29.270
I can't. He's already gone.
You ought to see him by now.

14:29.310 --> 14:31.190
I can't see the tip of my nose.

14:31.230 --> 14:33.670
It's closing in again.
You can't fell whaf this stuff will do.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.750
Stand by to put out a flare.

14:35.830 --> 14:38.870
Never mind the flare.
Joe heard every word.

14:38.950 --> 14:41.430
What'll I do? Come back?

14:41.470 --> 14:46.470
Yeah. It's thick down here. When you
get over the fog, I'll line you up.

14:46.550 --> 14:51.190
Geoff, tell that beautiful blonde
I'm still in the running.

14:51.270 --> 14:52.750
Stick to business!

14:52.830 --> 14:56.110
I want fo order two steaks for dinner.
How 'bout it, Dufchy?

14:56.190 --> 15:00.030
- I heard you. Tell him it's all right.
- It's all right with me, too.

15:01.270 --> 15:03.110
Joe, you're all set.

15:03.190 --> 15:05.310
Okay, here I come.

15:09.910 --> 15:13.350
- Plug in the field set. Get going!
- Yes, sir.

15:21.470 --> 15:24.590
Get the big light ready.
Turn it straight up.

15:24.670 --> 15:27.630
- It's cold out here.
- Light those tubs!

15:29.150 --> 15:30.550
Joe Souther.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.230
Okay, Geoff. Coming down.

15:34.310 --> 15:37.150
On fop of fhe fog af 1500.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.070
Higher than I thought.

15:39.150 --> 15:40.990
Watch. We're turning on the lights.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.910
- Turn 'em on.
- Here they go.

15:47.870 --> 15:49.870
Can you see them?

15:49.950 --> 15:53.590
No, not a thing.
I can't even see the glow.

15:54.590 --> 15:57.470
- Must be thicker than it looks.
- Won't hurt to take a stab at it.

15:57.550 --> 16:00.830
- Baldy, shut off that piano.
- Yes, sir.

16:00.870 --> 16:03.470
- Keep it quiet back there!
- Yes, sir.

16:17.550 --> 16:19.310
Yeah.

16:19.390 --> 16:23.030
Joe, pay attention.
It's closed in down here.

16:23.070 --> 16:25.830
You're west of the field.

16:25.910 --> 16:28.470
Fly due east.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.630
Flying at 1500 due east.

16:39.710 --> 16:42.670
Due east at 1500.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.830
Joe, blimp your motor.

16:46.790 --> 16:48.710
Joe, you're passing over the field.

16:48.790 --> 16:52.710
Go one mile, turn 180 degrees
and start letting down.

16:52.790 --> 16:54.910
And watch out
for the lights!

16:54.990 --> 16:56.950
Sounds a little that way.

16:57.030 --> 17:00.750
Yeah. Joe, you're a little south.
A little south.

17:00.830 --> 17:04.630
Okay, Papa, turning north.

17:04.710 --> 17:06.670
Turn off that light.

17:06.750 --> 17:09.109
Keep it quiet back there!

17:14.990 --> 17:17.270
Here I come.

17:17.310 --> 17:18.710
Twelve hundred.

17:20.349 --> 17:21.710
A fhousand.

17:23.069 --> 17:24.430
Eight hundred.

17:25.510 --> 17:26.910
Six hundred.

17:27.710 --> 17:31.710
Joe, you're coming in too high!
You'll overshoot the field!

17:32.790 --> 17:34.990
Make a turn, Joe.

17:35.070 --> 17:37.350
Go further back and try it again.

17:37.430 --> 17:39.830
Okay, I'm turning.

17:39.910 --> 17:42.270
Can't you see the lights?

17:42.350 --> 17:45.350
Nothing that even looks like
a dim candle.

17:47.190 --> 17:49.030
His line was okay.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.830
Yeah.

17:50.910 --> 17:54.870
Joe, your direction was perfect.
Be sure to keep the same line.

17:54.950 --> 17:58.830
All right. I'm turning.

17:58.910 --> 18:02.190
Here I come.
Six hundred.

18:02.270 --> 18:04.950
Cut it up in hundreds.

18:04.990 --> 18:06.390
Five hundred.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.190
Four hundred.

18:10.270 --> 18:12.790
Take it easy, sonny.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.190
Three hundred.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.310
Gun her, Joe!

18:18.270 --> 18:20.150
I'm down to 100 now.

18:20.190 --> 18:22.390
That doesn't sound like...

18:22.470 --> 18:24.670
Joe, pull up!

18:30.670 --> 18:33.270
Say, that wasn't right, was it?

18:33.310 --> 18:34.870
No, not quite.

18:38.350 --> 18:41.430
Joe, you had the wrong line.
You're way off...

18:41.510 --> 18:43.510
Okay, Geoff.

18:43.550 --> 18:46.230
I saw the lights.
I'll get it next time.

18:46.270 --> 18:49.950
Nothing doing. Don't take more chances.
You've got three hours of gas...

18:50.030 --> 18:54.070
Three hours? She'll almosf be
on fhe boat by then.

18:54.110 --> 18:56.390
I told you to stick to business.

18:56.470 --> 18:59.590
Get on top and cruise around
until it opens up here.

18:59.670 --> 19:01.510
Right. Don't let him do it.

19:01.590 --> 19:05.590
Geoff, give me one more chance.
I fhink I see a hole.

19:05.630 --> 19:07.790
Yeah, I do see one!
I'm coming down.

19:07.870 --> 19:09.710
- Joe, please don't!
- Stop.

19:09.790 --> 19:12.790
Joe, you've got your orders.
Stay up there and do as I tell you.

19:12.870 --> 19:14.750
Quit worrying about that blonde.

19:14.790 --> 19:18.990
It's all righf. I see fhe lights.
I'll make it easy.

19:19.070 --> 19:21.590
- There he is!
- Joe, pull up!

19:33.670 --> 19:37.710
Mike, get the wagon. Take big shears
in case you have to cut him out.

19:37.790 --> 19:39.990
Les, get the mail.

19:41.110 --> 19:45.430
Baldy, telephone the police.
Have them clear the field. Hurry up.

20:00.830 --> 20:03.510
Well, you did all you could.

20:04.950 --> 20:06.310
Yeah.

20:08.030 --> 20:09.510
Mr. Wise Guy.

20:12.870 --> 20:16.630
Oh, do something! He may be alive!
Don't just stand there!

20:16.670 --> 20:18.790
Pull yourself together!
Haven't you caused enough trouble?

20:18.870 --> 20:21.110
Calling Barranca. Calling Barranca.

20:25.630 --> 20:27.030
Go ahead, Tex.

20:27.070 --> 20:31.030
Geoff, did you get Joe down all right?

20:31.110 --> 20:33.870
All except for one tree
that stuck up too high.

20:34.910 --> 20:36.830
Oh. Sorry.

20:44.070 --> 20:47.630
Joe, you crazy fool!

20:47.710 --> 20:50.910
Nobody could tell you anything.
You knew it all.

20:50.990 --> 20:54.590
It serves you right.
I don't feel sorry for you. Not a bit.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.110
No skin off my nose.

20:57.190 --> 21:00.590
If you can take it, I can.

21:06.750 --> 21:08.590
I'll take a look over there.

21:08.670 --> 21:10.030
Okay, Kid.

21:26.310 --> 21:30.230
Sparks, I forgot to tell Les.
Have the mail put in #7.

21:31.230 --> 21:33.270
Get it out and warm it up.

21:34.950 --> 21:37.750
Calling Lookout.

21:37.790 --> 21:39.510
Go ahead.

21:39.550 --> 21:40.870
Any change, Tex?

21:40.950 --> 21:43.830
No, just about the same.

21:43.910 --> 21:46.550
All right.
We're all set to go down here.

21:46.590 --> 21:48.910
Okay.
I'll let you know.

21:48.990 --> 21:51.470
Wait a minute.

21:51.550 --> 21:54.190
- What?
- You're not going to...

21:54.270 --> 21:56.510
Go ahead and say it.

21:56.590 --> 22:00.150
When you got me
into this flying business...

22:00.230 --> 22:02.110
I was doing pretty good.

22:02.190 --> 22:05.950
I made good money, I ate good.
I slept good nights.

22:05.990 --> 22:08.390
In a week, you'll either collect
or lose your shirt.

22:08.470 --> 22:10.830
I'm not thinking about that.

22:10.910 --> 22:15.670
I can't go on killing nice kids.
Not if I lose a dozen shirts!

22:18.070 --> 22:20.310
Think you're the only one
that feels that way?

22:20.350 --> 22:23.510
Then why do you send them up
in that kind of weather?

22:23.550 --> 22:25.910
Because I'm running an airline!

22:25.950 --> 22:29.590
And I'm not running it any different
than anybody I ever flew for.

22:29.630 --> 22:31.030
Look, Dutchy...

22:33.110 --> 22:35.190
Joe died flying, didn't he?

22:35.270 --> 22:38.190
That was his job.

22:38.270 --> 22:42.470
He just wasn't good enough.
That's why he got it.

22:42.550 --> 22:47.030
I ain't built like you are.
I shouldn't be in such a business.

22:47.110 --> 22:49.190
We can't go on like that.

22:49.270 --> 22:53.430
Why not? You've got another pilot
coming in on the next boat.

22:53.470 --> 22:54.910
Oh, Geoff!

22:57.150 --> 23:00.150
You're a hard man.
Much too hard.

23:01.150 --> 23:03.470
Cut it out. Cut it out!

23:07.870 --> 23:13.230
Look. What's the use feeling bad
about something that couldn't be helped?

23:13.310 --> 23:15.150
Give me a match, will ya?

23:16.670 --> 23:19.550
I told you,
Joe just wasn't good enough.

23:19.590 --> 23:22.670
If he hadn't got it tonight,
he was bound to get it sooner or later.

23:22.750 --> 23:26.510
Then you had no business
to let him fly.

23:27.870 --> 23:30.070
What, ground that kid?

23:30.110 --> 23:32.750
He'd sooner be where he is
than quit.

23:34.310 --> 23:35.710
Here.

23:41.510 --> 23:42.910
Look, Dutch...

23:44.030 --> 23:46.390
Joe had a sister in the States,
didn't he?

23:46.430 --> 23:47.990
Yes.

23:48.030 --> 23:50.630
I owed him $100.

23:50.710 --> 23:52.870
Here. Send it to her.

23:52.950 --> 23:55.670
You don't owe him no money.

23:55.750 --> 23:58.870
- How do you know?
- Well, l...

23:59.950 --> 24:03.190
Because he's got two months' pay coming,
why should he loan from you?

24:05.910 --> 24:08.910
All right, if you've got so much dough
to throw around...

24:08.990 --> 24:11.670
why don't you get that plane
out of hock?

24:11.710 --> 24:13.110
Well...

24:14.390 --> 24:16.750
Take it easy, fella.
We'll get along.

24:19.870 --> 24:24.430
- How 'bout that food?
- Make it snappy. We're hungry.

24:25.510 --> 24:28.630
- Kid, how is it out there?
- Everything's all right.

24:28.670 --> 24:31.190
Yeah? Come on,
let's get a drink.

24:33.230 --> 24:35.670
Baldy, I'll take those.

24:35.750 --> 24:38.030
- Hello, Pancho.
- Hello, Geoff.

24:39.470 --> 24:42.030
Just a minute.
I can use that.

24:43.070 --> 24:45.790
- Gangway, Charlie.
- Hello, Geoff.

24:45.870 --> 24:47.230
Mr. Carter.

24:49.150 --> 24:51.350
Do you really think...

24:51.390 --> 24:54.430
Do you really think it was my fault
what happened?

24:54.510 --> 24:57.230
Sure, it was your fault.
You were gonna have dinner with him.

24:57.310 --> 24:59.670
The Dutchman hired him.
I sent him up on schedule.

24:59.750 --> 25:02.470
The fog came in.
A tree got in the way.

25:02.550 --> 25:04.430
All your fault.

25:04.510 --> 25:06.710
Forget it,
unless you want the honor.

25:10.110 --> 25:12.510
- Hello, Lily.
- Oh, Mr. Geoff!

25:12.590 --> 25:15.510
Throw this down. You'll feel better.
Bottoms up. Salud.

25:15.590 --> 25:16.910
Salud.

25:16.990 --> 25:19.670
It's pretty good.
The best I've ever seen.

25:19.710 --> 25:22.190
Bonnie, look at this.
Hiya, Gent.

25:23.510 --> 25:27.110
All right, meet Miss Lee.
Gent Shelton.

25:27.190 --> 25:28.910
- Hello.
- How do you do?

25:28.990 --> 25:30.390
Fine. How are you?

25:30.430 --> 25:33.070
- Where you been?
- At the warehouse checking spare parts.

25:33.150 --> 25:37.150
- Oh, I get it.
- Did I send you down there?

25:37.230 --> 25:39.350
You'll think up some other job
to get rid of me.

25:39.430 --> 25:41.950
- I missed the excitement around here.
- You did.

25:42.030 --> 25:44.190
- Haven't seen a better one.
- She's a good one.

25:44.270 --> 25:46.710
- What'll you have to drink?
- Anything. You name it.

25:46.790 --> 25:49.430
- How about you, Miss Lee?
- What did you say?

25:49.510 --> 25:51.590
- You want a drink?
- No, I don't want any.

25:51.670 --> 25:54.110
- Have one anyway. Pancho?
- I'll have one, too.

25:54.190 --> 25:55.990
Send over some drinks.

25:56.030 --> 25:59.190
- Right.
- Gangway, please.

25:59.270 --> 26:01.150
Here's your steak, miss.

26:01.190 --> 26:04.790
- Here's the other one. Who wants it?
- I'll take it over here.

26:04.830 --> 26:07.630
- Give me some coffee.
- You want some coffee, miss?

26:07.710 --> 26:10.670
- That looks all right.
- You're here in time for the fireworks.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.270
How can you do that?

26:13.310 --> 26:15.230
- What?
- Eat that steak?

26:15.310 --> 26:17.670
- What's the matter with it?
- It was his!

26:20.270 --> 26:22.350
Want me to have it stuffed?

26:22.430 --> 26:25.030
Don't you realize he's dead?

26:27.110 --> 26:30.230
- Who's dead?
- Yeah, who's dead?

26:30.310 --> 26:32.470
- Who's Joe?
- Anybody know Joe?

26:32.550 --> 26:36.790
What's the matter? He was talking
and laughing with us, and now he's...

26:36.830 --> 26:39.510
Let's break fhe news to Mother

26:39.590 --> 26:43.190
And tell her there's no other

26:43.230 --> 26:44.590
You...

26:44.670 --> 26:46.510
How do you like that?

26:47.710 --> 26:50.870
Wait a minute, you little fool.
Why don't you use your...

26:52.230 --> 26:53.590
Stop it.

26:53.670 --> 26:55.830
I don't know how you can act like this
when that poor kid...

26:55.870 --> 26:57.750
- I know. He's dead.
- Yes, he's dead!

26:57.790 --> 26:59.670
That's right.
He's been dead 20 minutes.

26:59.710 --> 27:04.070
And all the weeping won't make him
any deader 20 years from now.

27:04.150 --> 27:07.030
If you feel like bawling,
how do you think we feel?

27:07.110 --> 27:12.470
Go outside and walk around. Stay there
until you put all that together.

27:20.550 --> 27:22.830
Was that you
they were razzing in there?

27:24.990 --> 27:27.590
Don't feel too bad about it.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.590
I did the same thing
when I first came.

27:33.110 --> 27:37.990
- Mister, can you kick real hard?
- Maybe you won't need it.

27:38.070 --> 27:40.110
I think I'd feel better.

27:40.190 --> 27:42.190
All my life,
I've hated funerals.

27:42.270 --> 27:44.550
The fuss and bother
never brings anybody back.

27:44.630 --> 27:47.350
It just spoils remembering them
as they really are.

27:47.430 --> 27:52.150
When I see people actually facing it
that way, I have to act like a sap.

27:52.190 --> 27:54.190
This flying business is new to me.

27:55.270 --> 27:58.150
You have to have some crazy way
of looking at it to go on.

27:58.230 --> 28:00.830
Does this sort of thing happen often?

28:00.910 --> 28:03.350
That depends on weather and luck.

28:03.430 --> 28:07.590
We've drawn space twice in the last
three months, not counting this one.

28:07.670 --> 28:09.670
I suppose they'll
be at it again tomorrow.

28:09.750 --> 28:12.110
Tonight if it clears.

28:12.190 --> 28:16.430
- They must love it, flying, I mean.
- Why do you think they come here?

28:16.510 --> 28:18.790
It's like being in love
with a buzz saw.

28:18.870 --> 28:20.270
Not much future.

28:20.350 --> 28:22.470
What is there about it
that gets them?

28:22.550 --> 28:25.310
I'm not a flier.
You better ask the Kid.

28:25.390 --> 28:29.230
Miss Lee, Mr. Dabb.
She wants to know why you like flying.

28:29.310 --> 28:34.230
I been in it 22 years. I couldn't give
you an answer that would make sense.

28:35.910 --> 28:37.870
What's so funny?

28:37.950 --> 28:40.470
- That's what my dad used to say.
- Flier?

28:40.550 --> 28:43.350
No, trapeze. High stuff.
He wouldn't use a net.

28:44.070 --> 28:45.950
Not much future in that, either.

28:45.990 --> 28:49.390
Yes. We found that out.

28:52.030 --> 28:56.030
Tell me about this headman, Geoff.
Does he go up, too?

28:56.110 --> 28:59.110
Only when he thinks it's too tough
for anyone else.

28:59.190 --> 29:02.190
Well, just goes to show you
how wrong you can be.

29:02.270 --> 29:04.910
The Kid could tell ya.
He's Geoff's best friend.

29:04.990 --> 29:09.750
I can tell you, he's a good guy
for gals to stay away from.

29:10.910 --> 29:12.790
Thank you.
I'll remember that.

29:17.510 --> 29:20.550
- What's it gonna be?
- How about "Some of These Days"?

29:20.630 --> 29:22.270
How's it go?

29:29.710 --> 29:32.590
There's no B flat.
It goes like that.

29:32.670 --> 29:35.790
- What do you want?
- I came for that drink you offered me.

29:35.870 --> 29:38.870
- Oh. Grown up yet?
- Hope so.

29:38.910 --> 29:40.790
- Charlie?
- Yes, sir.

29:40.830 --> 29:42.750
Go ahead, Gent.

29:44.470 --> 29:46.950
You're gonna miss your baby

29:47.030 --> 29:50.350
That's awful!
Can't you hear that?

29:50.430 --> 29:53.350
Yes, I know. Will you go away please?
We'll get it.

29:53.430 --> 29:55.110
You want to hear
how it really goes?

29:55.190 --> 29:57.030
- Sure.
- Move over.

29:57.110 --> 29:59.550
- You better be good.
- Won't be as corny as you.

29:59.630 --> 30:03.550
Boys, you take the pickup
with the horn. Make it slow and easy.

30:03.630 --> 30:06.870
Rest of you watch for the breaks.
Ready now? Here we go.

30:25.550 --> 30:27.190
I'll take it!

30:52.670 --> 30:55.990
- Hello, professional.
- It's part of the specialty.

30:56.070 --> 30:58.070
- Yeah?
- Here's to you.

31:02.630 --> 31:05.190
- Got a match?
- Yes.

31:05.270 --> 31:06.750
Thanks.

31:11.390 --> 31:14.230
- Who's Joe?
- Never heard of him.

31:14.270 --> 31:17.150
- Anyone know "The Peanut Vendor"?
- Yes, sir!

31:17.190 --> 31:19.270
Give me those, honey.

31:24.670 --> 31:27.910
Peanufs

31:39.870 --> 31:41.750
So long.

31:50.310 --> 31:52.190
I'll take care of it.

31:52.230 --> 31:54.110
All right, Mike.
Good night.

31:56.270 --> 31:58.750
Here's all the stuff
that was turned in.

31:58.830 --> 32:01.870
I gave his clothes
to the men on the field.

32:01.950 --> 32:03.310
Yeah.

32:04.910 --> 32:08.310
He didn't have much to show
for all...

32:09.630 --> 32:11.270
Take your pick.

32:11.350 --> 32:14.070
I got a drawerful
of that junk already.

32:14.110 --> 32:16.630
I'm gonna get some sleep.
The Kid's sitting in for me.

32:16.710 --> 32:18.750
- Good night.
- Good night, Sparks.

32:21.630 --> 32:23.790
See anything you'd like to have?

32:23.870 --> 32:26.950
I don't need anything
to remember him by.

32:27.030 --> 32:29.390
You want a drink, help yourself.

32:33.110 --> 32:35.270
- Good-bye, Miss Lee.
- Good-bye, Dutchy.

32:35.350 --> 32:39.190
- Drop in again when you come this way.
- Thank you. I will.

32:51.270 --> 32:54.750
Well, good-bye, mister. It's too bad
Barranca's so far from Brooklyn.

32:54.830 --> 32:59.430
What's your hurry? It's a few minutes
past 12:00. Your boat leaves at 4:00.

32:59.510 --> 33:00.910
Here. Say when.

33:00.990 --> 33:03.430
When are you gonna get some sleep?

33:03.510 --> 33:06.070
After your boat sails.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.390
Aren't you wasting your time?

33:08.470 --> 33:10.670
That's a point
that's open to argument.

33:10.750 --> 33:13.430
That's what I'm afraid of.
Those arguments.

33:13.510 --> 33:16.950
- What's the matter with 'em?
- They're too one-sided.

33:17.030 --> 33:19.030
No hard feelings.

33:19.070 --> 33:21.310
Your apology is accepted.

33:23.950 --> 33:26.710
How 'bout taking along
a souvenir?

33:29.870 --> 33:31.230
Why not?

33:32.070 --> 33:34.430
Help yourself.

33:35.430 --> 33:38.150
You've got a good eye, lady.

33:40.350 --> 33:44.110
Somebody must've given you
an awful beating once.

33:52.350 --> 33:53.510
Go home.

33:58.350 --> 33:59.710
Good night.

34:14.989 --> 34:18.110
- You're a queer duck.
- So are you!

34:18.190 --> 34:20.190
I can't make you out.

34:20.270 --> 34:23.350
Same here.
What was she like, anyway?

34:23.429 --> 34:26.030
- Who?
- That girl that made you act this way.

34:26.830 --> 34:31.310
A whole lot like you.
Just as nice, almost as smart.

34:32.350 --> 34:35.350
- Chorus girl?
- Only by temperament.

34:35.389 --> 34:38.150
At least you're true
to the type.

34:38.230 --> 34:41.550
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

34:41.630 --> 34:44.469
Still carrying the torch for her,
aren't you?

34:44.510 --> 34:48.190
- Got a match?
- Don't you ever have any?

34:48.270 --> 34:51.150
Nope. Don't believe of laying in
a supply of anything. Thanks.

34:51.230 --> 34:53.989
- Matches, marbles, money or women.
- That's right.

34:54.070 --> 34:57.550
No looking ahead, no tomorrows.
Just today.

34:57.630 --> 34:59.990
Is that why
she gave you the air?

35:00.070 --> 35:02.590
- Who?
- That girl.

35:02.670 --> 35:06.110
I wouldn't ask any woman to...

35:06.190 --> 35:09.270
You can think up more questions!
Here.

35:10.750 --> 35:13.510
- What wouldn't you?
- What?

35:13.590 --> 35:15.670
Ask anybody to do.

35:17.110 --> 35:20.910
Did you ever know a woman
that didn't want to make plans?

35:20.990 --> 35:24.150
Map out everything?
Get it all set?

35:25.150 --> 35:27.470
I don't blame them, I guess.

35:27.550 --> 35:30.630
It's the only way
they can run a home and have kids.

35:30.710 --> 35:34.150
I suppose you think that's easier,
less dangerous than flying.

35:34.230 --> 35:37.830
- I don't know. I never tried it.
- Didn't you ask her to?

35:37.910 --> 35:39.790
- Who?
- That girl!

35:39.870 --> 35:42.230
I told you.
I wouldn't ask any woman.

35:42.270 --> 35:45.270
What if she were willing?

35:45.350 --> 35:47.830
That's what they all say.

35:47.910 --> 35:50.990
Women think they can take it,
but they can't.

35:52.030 --> 35:54.590
The minute you get up in the air,
they start calling the airport.

35:54.670 --> 35:58.870
When you get down, they're waiting for
you so scared, they hate your insides.

35:58.950 --> 36:01.990
What if she were the type
that didn't scare so easily?

36:02.070 --> 36:03.910
There's no such animal.

36:03.990 --> 36:05.910
How do you know?

36:05.990 --> 36:10.830
The girl I was telling you about
came as close to it as anybody I met.

36:10.910 --> 36:15.270
One night when I was lost in a fog,
I was glad to get my feet on the ground.

36:15.350 --> 36:18.950
What do you think the "welcome home"
speech was? She was hoping I'd crashed.

36:19.990 --> 36:21.190
What?

36:21.270 --> 36:25.590
She couldn't stand the gaff. She'd
rather see me dead, have it over with.

36:25.670 --> 36:28.310
Told me if I didn't quit flying,
it was all off.

36:29.710 --> 36:33.910
- You wouldn't, would you?
- I'm still flying.

36:33.990 --> 36:35.950
Wonder what happened to her.

36:36.030 --> 36:37.390
Who?

36:38.590 --> 36:42.070
I don't know for sure.
I heard she married another flier.

36:43.910 --> 36:46.910
Is there anything else
you'd like to know about me?

36:46.990 --> 36:49.750
Would you like to go over
to my room?

36:49.790 --> 36:52.790
Got the letters from home.
Pictures of my father and mother.

36:52.830 --> 36:55.110
Pictures of me the first time
I went up in the air.

36:55.190 --> 36:57.350
Pictures of my first crash.

36:57.430 --> 36:59.310
Any pictures
when you were a baby?

37:00.670 --> 37:03.510
I don't remember.
Want to go and look?

37:06.590 --> 37:07.950
Sure.

37:19.350 --> 37:20.390
Bonnie.

37:21.950 --> 37:25.230
Keep going. Follow your nose.
It'll take you to the boat.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.190
I've got to stick around here.

37:28.230 --> 37:30.790
So that's where we were going.

37:31.710 --> 37:34.590
Take care of yourself.
What?

37:34.630 --> 37:37.710
Tex just called from the Lookout.
He says the pass is clearing.

37:37.790 --> 37:41.350
- Did you wake Les up?
- No, because...

37:41.430 --> 37:43.670
Tex says it's nobody's picnic.

37:43.710 --> 37:46.590
All right. Wind up #7.
Put some coffee in it.

37:46.630 --> 37:48.510
I already did.

37:52.550 --> 37:55.350
So long, Bonnie.
Have a nice trip.

37:55.390 --> 37:57.510
Wait a minute.
You're going up yourself?

37:57.590 --> 37:59.910
- Sure.
- When will you be back?

37:59.990 --> 38:03.910
Takes three hours each way. Won't
be back till after your boat sails.

38:03.990 --> 38:05.830
I'll look you up in New York.

38:05.910 --> 38:07.830
- What?
- What?

38:07.910 --> 38:11.230
- You'll look me up in New York?
- Sure.

38:11.270 --> 38:13.470
I'll see you there.
What did you say?

38:13.550 --> 38:15.750
When are you coming?

38:15.830 --> 38:18.190
Next week, 2:00.

38:18.270 --> 38:20.830
I like that saying good-bye.
Let's try again, huh?

38:21.910 --> 38:23.270
So long.

38:29.110 --> 38:32.510
Things happen awful fast
around here.

38:56.350 --> 38:59.070
Is it going to be dangerous?

38:59.150 --> 39:03.070
What do you want to do,
put a net under him?

39:06.190 --> 39:09.950
Well, lady, you're really
better off this way.

39:11.470 --> 39:13.790
Sure, I guess...

39:15.110 --> 39:17.910
Look, I hardly know the man!

39:17.950 --> 39:20.190
Sure. But you'll get over it.

39:21.790 --> 39:25.670
Good-bye, Miss Lee.
I gotta keep tabs on him.

39:25.750 --> 39:27.110
Bye.

40:16.990 --> 40:19.510
Calling Lookout.

40:19.590 --> 40:22.030
Hello, Kid.
Did Geoff get down all right?

40:22.110 --> 40:23.950
Sure. He's all right.

40:24.030 --> 40:26.710
That's good. I couldn'f see him
when he passed here.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.950
Signing off.

40:44.550 --> 40:46.870
That was a pretty quick trip
you made.

40:50.790 --> 40:52.790
I still say it was
a pretty quick trip.

40:52.870 --> 40:55.670
- Shut up.
- It wasn't slow.

40:57.510 --> 41:00.430
Morning, Charlie.
How 'bout a hot cup of...

41:05.310 --> 41:07.710
- What are you doing here?
- Having my breakfast.

41:07.790 --> 41:10.150
Is your boat still here?

41:10.230 --> 41:13.510
Has it sailed?
How'd you get left behind?

41:13.590 --> 41:14.950
I just...

41:16.870 --> 41:19.670
- Go on.
- I just told the man.

41:19.750 --> 41:21.510
Told him what?

41:21.590 --> 41:23.990
Put my trunk on the dock.

41:24.070 --> 41:27.350
- Why?
- Well...

41:27.430 --> 41:31.190
I couldn't stay over without having
anything to wear. Could I?

41:31.270 --> 41:33.350
What's so strange about that?

41:33.430 --> 41:36.110
- Doesn't it seem strange to you?
- What?

41:36.190 --> 41:38.830
Getting off that boat.
Doesn't it?

41:40.470 --> 41:42.830
I don't know.

41:42.910 --> 41:46.670
The girl that got off that boat's
the perfect stranger to me.

41:46.750 --> 41:48.150
I don't know.

41:48.190 --> 41:51.070
I don't know whether this is me
or another fella.

41:51.110 --> 41:55.670
By all rights, Bonnie Lee oughta be
asleep on that boat far out to sea.

41:55.710 --> 41:58.830
She's not so far out to sea
as you think.

41:58.910 --> 42:00.750
- Who?
- The boat.

42:00.830 --> 42:02.870
Kid, put some more gas in #7.

42:02.950 --> 42:05.870
Have Santa Maria hold the boat
until we get there.

42:05.950 --> 42:08.230
Where's your luggage?
Where is it?

42:08.310 --> 42:09.830
- Over there.
- Good.

42:09.910 --> 42:11.990
What are you waiting for, Kid?

42:12.070 --> 42:15.150
- Boat doesn't stop at Santa Maria.
- Why not?

42:15.230 --> 42:17.430
- They have no bananas.
- "They have no bananas"?

42:17.510 --> 42:19.830
Yes, they have no bananas.

42:19.870 --> 42:21.910
Oh, shut up.

42:21.990 --> 42:26.590
Don't worry, mister. You don't have
to bother about me. I'm cured.

42:26.670 --> 42:29.950
- There's a first time for everything.
- What do you mean?

42:30.030 --> 42:33.990
I've never quite made such a chump
out of myself. I'm sorry.

42:34.070 --> 42:35.590
I'm sorry l...

42:37.110 --> 42:41.030
- No, I'm not either. I'm glad.
- You're not making sense.

42:41.110 --> 42:42.710
You're telling me.

42:42.790 --> 42:46.670
If I'd taken that boat,
I'd have gone remembering a swell guy.

42:46.750 --> 42:50.950
Someone who lived up to a screwy ideal
that l... I don't know.

42:51.030 --> 42:52.910
I wouldn't ask any woman...

42:52.990 --> 42:54.910
You wouldn't ask any woman
to do anything.

42:54.990 --> 42:57.510
That's right.
There's something else I wouldn't do.

42:57.590 --> 42:58.950
What?

42:59.030 --> 43:01.830
Get burned twice in the same place.

43:01.910 --> 43:04.790
- There's another boat leaving next week.
- I'll be on it.

43:04.870 --> 43:07.430
Good. I'm gonna get some sleep.

43:19.190 --> 43:24.190
Well, if you're gonna be here, we've got
to find someplace for you to park.

43:24.270 --> 43:26.630
Yeah. I guess so.

43:26.710 --> 43:28.790
Can I have a nice room with a bath?

43:28.870 --> 43:30.710
I'll see what I can do.

43:31.510 --> 43:35.910
You know,
I always did like a bath...

43:35.990 --> 43:38.350
better than a shower.

43:48.550 --> 43:50.710
Morning, Doc.

43:50.790 --> 43:52.710
What are you doing here?

43:52.790 --> 43:55.030
What are you...

44:03.550 --> 44:05.790
Yeah. Thanks, Doc, thanks.

44:07.270 --> 44:09.230
What's he saying?

44:09.310 --> 44:11.670
He's waiting for a call
from a San Felipe mine.

44:11.750 --> 44:13.990
Hartword's son's had an accident.

44:14.070 --> 44:16.950
- How bad?
- We're waiting to find out.

44:17.030 --> 44:19.270
Can't take a chance of putting
a plane there.

44:19.350 --> 44:22.070
It's worse than getting a piano
over a transom.

44:22.150 --> 44:23.510
Come on in.

44:25.070 --> 44:27.870
- Who's gonna meet the southbound boat?
- Why don't you send Les?

44:27.950 --> 44:30.070
Better go yourself.
You've got that new flier coming in.

44:30.110 --> 44:32.630
- What's his name?
- Mac something. What is it, Sparks?

44:32.710 --> 44:35.590
- MacPherson.
- What is it?

44:35.670 --> 44:38.390
What's the difference
as long as he can fly?

44:38.470 --> 44:40.830
Can't afford to be fussy down here.

44:40.910 --> 44:44.470
- Go on. Go and meet the flier.
- All right.

44:44.510 --> 44:47.790
- Tell Charlie to get me some breakfast.
- Yes, sir.

44:51.310 --> 44:54.510
Sparks, try Hartword again, will you?

45:00.070 --> 45:02.270
Here's the mail.

45:02.350 --> 45:04.470
And his name is MacPherson.

45:04.550 --> 45:07.830
- How'd you find that out?
- He told me.

45:07.870 --> 45:11.350
- Where is he?
- Putting his things in his room.

45:11.390 --> 45:13.390
- I'll be out in a minute.
- All right.

45:13.470 --> 45:15.670
- Don't strain yourself.
- Yes, sir.

45:23.230 --> 45:27.830
- Your room all right, Mr. MacPherson?
- It'll do.

45:27.910 --> 45:30.350
Let's get you acquainted around here.

45:30.430 --> 45:33.270
Boys, this is Mr. MacPherson,
our new flier.

45:33.310 --> 45:35.470
- Welcome to our fair city.
- Les Peters.

45:35.550 --> 45:37.750
- This is Gent Shelton.
- How do you do?

45:37.790 --> 45:41.270
Mike, this is Mr. MacPherson.
Our head mechanic.

45:41.350 --> 45:43.510
- How are ya?
- How are ya?

45:43.590 --> 45:45.870
- Too early to buy a drink?
- I guess not. Let's sit down.

45:45.950 --> 45:47.830
- Where are you from?
- Mexico City.

45:47.870 --> 45:51.030
- What kind of stuff they using there?
- The same old...

45:51.070 --> 45:53.350
Well, well, look who's here!

45:53.430 --> 45:56.950
Felicia! Elena!
I didn't know you came in that boat.

45:56.990 --> 45:59.950
Mac, you'll have to buy more drinks.

46:00.030 --> 46:03.270
This is Elena Silva
and Felicia Torres.

46:03.350 --> 46:06.790
Mr. MacPherson, this is Mike.

46:06.870 --> 46:08.790
- Get a good sleep?
- No!

46:08.870 --> 46:12.950
- Geoff, Mr. MacPherson is here.
- Glad to see you.

46:12.990 --> 46:15.030
Excuse me. Hello!

46:16.350 --> 46:19.710
- How are you, Lola?
- Not Lola. Felicia.

46:19.790 --> 46:23.150
That's right.
Felicia, how's Panama?

46:23.230 --> 46:26.070
Geoff, it was Puerto Rico.

46:26.110 --> 46:28.350
- Is that where it was?
- Yes.

46:28.430 --> 46:31.270
I can't remember names.
I'm better at faces.

46:35.430 --> 46:37.870
Your name's not MacPherson.
It's Kilgallen.

46:40.950 --> 46:44.070
You're not so bad on names after all.

46:44.150 --> 46:45.830
You heard him.

46:45.910 --> 46:49.030
- Bat Kilgallen.
- That's right.

46:49.110 --> 46:53.230
What about it? He's not the first guy
to come here under a different name.

46:53.310 --> 46:56.110
No, but he's the first pilot
who bailed out of his plane...

46:56.190 --> 46:58.830
and let his mechanic crash.

46:58.910 --> 47:01.430
Habit of yours, being right,
isn't it?

47:01.510 --> 47:04.150
- Look...
- Cut it out, Les.

47:04.230 --> 47:08.710
Hey, did you know the Kid
was working down here?

47:08.790 --> 47:11.670
- What?
- He is.

47:13.830 --> 47:16.550
I don't think there's anything funny
about that.

47:16.630 --> 47:18.510
You're right, there isn't.

47:18.590 --> 47:21.550
But I had to come a long way
to find it out.

47:21.630 --> 47:24.150
- Of all the cast-iron crust.
- Don't flatter me.

47:24.230 --> 47:26.390
What's the Kid got to do with it?

47:26.430 --> 47:28.910
Nothing, except it was the Kid's
younger brother that was killed...

47:28.990 --> 47:31.150
when this guy took
to his parachute.

47:33.190 --> 47:35.430
- I've had enough of this.
- Me, too.

47:35.510 --> 47:37.870
Elena, we're gonna move.

47:40.870 --> 47:42.390
Coming, Geoff?

47:43.390 --> 47:47.070
- No, this is good enough for me.
- Not so particular, huh?

47:47.150 --> 47:49.430
I don't think even you
can spoil good liquor.

47:49.510 --> 47:53.230
Thanks. I'm not used
to these small favors.

47:53.310 --> 47:57.070
I'm sorry I said it. I'm not used
to being around people like you.

48:06.430 --> 48:09.030
Here it goes.
That's the Kid coming in now.

48:09.110 --> 48:12.350
Quiet, Dutch.
You better make yourself scarce.

48:12.430 --> 48:15.510
For your information,
the Kid carries a gun.

48:15.550 --> 48:18.990
- Aren't you getting careful of me?
- I'm not worrying about you.

48:19.070 --> 48:21.630
It'll be inconvenient for me
if they slap the Kid in the hoosegow.

48:21.710 --> 48:23.590
I have to meet him sooner or later.

48:23.670 --> 48:26.870
Maybe you're right.
Well, it's your funeral.

48:29.310 --> 48:31.790
All passengers aboard the boat.

48:37.470 --> 48:39.750
I remember.
It was Puerto Rico.

48:39.830 --> 48:41.190
So long.

48:43.550 --> 48:47.830
Whew! It's hot on the ground.
Give me some cold water.

48:47.870 --> 48:49.910
Who's got a match?

48:51.430 --> 48:53.270
What's the matter?

48:53.350 --> 48:55.790
It's like walking in a graveyard.

48:56.830 --> 49:00.950
Hello! You the new guy?
Welcome to our city.

49:00.990 --> 49:02.630
My name's...

49:05.510 --> 49:07.030
Hello, Kilgallen.

49:08.470 --> 49:10.310
Long time, no see.

49:12.390 --> 49:13.710
That's right.

49:17.670 --> 49:20.230
I thought there was some...

49:23.150 --> 49:24.510
Look, you...

49:30.150 --> 49:32.470
I'm all right.

49:34.270 --> 49:37.350
Two years ago,
I'd have broke your...

49:40.030 --> 49:43.790
Keep out of my sight.
I may still do it.

49:51.430 --> 49:54.230
It's none of my business,
but I don't know why you stopped him.

49:54.310 --> 49:56.750
You're right.
It's none of your business.

50:00.990 --> 50:04.590
Judy, I want you
to meet these people.

50:04.670 --> 50:07.390
Gentlemen, this is Mrs. MacPherson.

50:07.470 --> 50:10.790
- Mr...
- My name is Shelton.

50:10.870 --> 50:14.190
This is Les Peters,
and this is Mr. Vanrider, our boss.

50:14.270 --> 50:16.230
Mr. Vanrider met us
at the boat.

50:16.310 --> 50:18.950
And Geoff Carter.

50:19.030 --> 50:20.790
Mrs. MacPherson.

50:20.830 --> 50:22.230
Mr. Carter.

50:23.070 --> 50:25.990
I'm sorry, Bat, but I forgot
to ask you for the trunk keys.

50:26.070 --> 50:27.670
Yes, you did.

50:27.750 --> 50:30.070
- I'm afraid I interrupted something.
- Not at all.

50:30.110 --> 50:32.790
There you are.
I'll see you in a few minutes.

50:32.870 --> 50:34.990
I'm glad to have met everyone.

50:42.870 --> 50:45.270
No, she doesn't know about me.

50:47.190 --> 50:48.950
Come on.

50:48.990 --> 50:52.030
- You're not gonna put this guy to work.
- That, too, is none of your business.

50:52.110 --> 50:54.510
- Who's running this airline?
- You are.

50:54.590 --> 50:57.350
- That's what I mean.
- You don't seem to remember that.

50:59.710 --> 51:03.110
- Did you get old man Hartword yet?
- No, the line's still busy.

51:05.190 --> 51:09.310
- You do some queer things, Kilgallen.
- MacPherson's the name.

51:09.390 --> 51:12.350
That's what I'm saying. Why didn't
you tell her what you've done?

51:12.430 --> 51:15.270
Let's get this over with.
When does the next boat leave?

51:15.350 --> 51:18.670
Have you got enough dough
for your passages?

51:20.710 --> 51:22.070
That's fine.

51:30.750 --> 51:33.510
- I wonder if I could.
- What?

51:33.590 --> 51:36.630
- Cram you down their throats.
- That bunch in there?

51:36.670 --> 51:38.070
Yeah.

51:38.150 --> 51:40.110
I wouldn't mind choking a few of 'em.

51:44.670 --> 51:47.470
Hello? Yes, Mr. Hartword,
I've been trying to get you.

51:47.550 --> 51:51.110
I've got to get my boy out of here,
or bring a doctor in.

51:51.190 --> 51:53.990
I'd like to help you, but I can't
take a chance on losing a plane.

51:54.070 --> 51:58.110
The Dutchman's hard up. You get a doctor
here, you can write your own ticket.

51:58.190 --> 52:00.270
I'll take responsibility
for the plane.

52:00.350 --> 52:03.430
Yeah? Wait a minute.
Fella?

52:03.510 --> 52:06.470
- Want a chance?
- What do you think?

52:06.550 --> 52:09.510
I'm not promising you a job,
but you'll make your passage home.

52:09.590 --> 52:13.030
- That's all right with me.
- You got a deal.

52:13.110 --> 52:16.590
Right away. Put up some smoke
so we can tell about the wind.

52:16.670 --> 52:18.510
Sure. Good-bye.

52:18.590 --> 52:22.270
Sparks, get the doctor. You're taking
a doctor to a boy who's hurt.

52:22.350 --> 52:24.190
It's a bad place to get into,
worse to get out.

52:24.270 --> 52:27.870
- Have you got a map?
- I'll get you one. Here we are.

52:27.950 --> 52:29.750
- Here he is.
- Hello, Doc.

52:29.830 --> 52:33.710
Tell the doctor this is no cinch.
He doesn't have to go.

52:36.310 --> 52:41.030
Here we are, and here's the mine.
It's situated on a small plateau...

52:42.390 --> 52:44.070
Sure, Doc.

52:54.270 --> 52:55.630
Sure.

52:56.470 --> 52:58.590
- That's right.
- I go!

53:03.790 --> 53:05.830
- He's evidently going.
- You hurt his feelings.

53:05.910 --> 53:07.110
Why?

53:07.190 --> 53:10.990
He was quoting Shakespeare
from Henry IV, I think.

53:11.070 --> 53:14.870
He said, "A man can die but once.
We owe God a debt.

53:14.950 --> 53:17.910
If we pay it today,
we don't owe it tomorrow."

53:19.270 --> 53:21.110
He's no fool.

53:21.190 --> 53:24.030
Get going. They'll be waiting for you
after you say good-bye to your wife.

53:24.110 --> 53:26.630
- How do you get over this stuff?
- Where?

53:26.710 --> 53:29.070
There's a pass there, 14,000 feet.
See it?

53:29.150 --> 53:31.150
Right.

53:31.230 --> 53:35.670
When you land, come in short or you'll
run out of ground. There's a big drop.

53:35.750 --> 53:37.870
- Thanks.
- Okay. For what?

53:37.950 --> 53:39.830
I'll get things ready for him.

53:39.870 --> 53:42.390
- Tell the Kid I want to see him.
- All right.

53:49.710 --> 53:52.430
Hello, Kid.
Put down those shades, will ya?

53:52.510 --> 53:56.630
Hey, what about
this guy Kilgallen, MacPherson?

53:56.670 --> 53:58.750
Come over here.

53:58.830 --> 54:02.190
- Not putting him to work, are you?
- We'll talk about that later.

54:02.270 --> 54:03.590
Sit down.

54:04.630 --> 54:07.470
- Giving me an eye test?
- Yeah. Read that fourth line.

54:07.550 --> 54:11.310
- You're not worried about my eyes?
- I have been for some time.

54:11.350 --> 54:14.830
- Because I didn't know him right off?
- Quit stalling. Go ahead.

54:14.910 --> 54:16.590
L-P-E-D.

54:16.670 --> 54:19.830
That's very good.
Stay there.

54:19.910 --> 54:21.870
I got a new one for you.

54:27.630 --> 54:29.470
Fourth line on this.

54:30.870 --> 54:32.430
P-T-E-O.

54:33.150 --> 54:35.310
Try the fifth.

54:35.350 --> 54:37.110
F-Z-B-D-E.

54:38.870 --> 54:41.030
Now read it backwards.

54:43.350 --> 54:45.950
E-D-B-Z-F.

54:46.030 --> 54:48.230
- That's better than I can do.
- What about this guy...

54:48.310 --> 54:50.230
Wait, you're not through.

54:52.430 --> 54:54.630
Take a shot at this.

54:54.710 --> 54:58.390
- Where'd you get that?
- Mike made it.

54:58.430 --> 55:00.630
Here you are.

55:02.310 --> 55:03.670
Line them up.

55:23.590 --> 55:25.110
They're together now.

55:25.190 --> 55:27.030
Yeah.

55:32.270 --> 55:33.550
How'd I do?

55:35.230 --> 55:36.950
Not bad.

55:37.030 --> 55:39.350
What about Kilgallen?

55:39.430 --> 55:41.310
He's not staying here, is he?

55:41.390 --> 55:43.870
- Why not?
- Why not?

55:43.950 --> 55:46.350
I thought you'd be the last guy
to ask me that. He's no good.

55:46.390 --> 55:48.310
Take it easy, Kid.

55:49.430 --> 55:53.630
Think he's any worse than a guy
who'd double-cross his best friend?

55:53.710 --> 55:57.310
I don't care about myself.
Anything you do is all right with me.

55:57.390 --> 55:59.790
But if the Dutchman loses
another plane, he's cooked.

55:59.870 --> 56:01.910
Cooked? I thought
he was rolling in dough.

56:04.590 --> 56:07.830
Why do you think the new trimotor
is still at the dock?

56:07.870 --> 56:10.190
I did wonder about that.

56:11.590 --> 56:18.350
Look, Kid, here it is.
Dutchy made an agreement.

56:18.430 --> 56:20.430
He'd get a long contract
and a subsidy.

56:20.510 --> 56:23.030
You know what that would mean?
Plenty of money around here.

56:23.110 --> 56:26.190
No more secondhand junk to fly,
no more pass to monkey with.

56:26.270 --> 56:29.910
These new jobs can get over the top
of those peaks in any kind of weather.

56:29.950 --> 56:32.310
That would be nice.

56:32.350 --> 56:34.510
- When did the schedules start?
- Six months ago.

56:34.550 --> 56:36.790
- Then you're...
- Only one more week.

56:36.830 --> 56:39.470
Or until the northbound boat arrives.

56:39.510 --> 56:42.630
That's why you've
been forcing things, huh?

56:42.710 --> 56:45.070
Why didn't you tell a fella?

56:45.150 --> 56:48.070
- Dutchy.
- Dutchy? How?

56:48.150 --> 56:50.750
He was afraid if you guys knew
the spot he was in...

56:50.830 --> 56:52.670
you'd take unnecessary chances.

56:55.230 --> 56:57.110
What a guy.

57:00.230 --> 57:02.150
Yeah.

57:07.190 --> 57:08.550
Yeah.

57:10.310 --> 57:12.630
You were right about my eyes.

57:15.310 --> 57:17.550
I couldn't read those cards.

57:17.590 --> 57:19.990
I learned it by heart.

57:20.070 --> 57:22.190
What about the new one?

57:22.230 --> 57:24.590
Dutchy told me where you hid it.

57:26.710 --> 57:29.150
The old fool.
Double-crossing himself.

57:29.230 --> 57:31.150
He wasn't thinking about that.

57:31.230 --> 57:34.030
He was thinking how you'd feel
grounding me.

57:40.470 --> 57:42.390
You're through flying, Kid.

57:45.390 --> 57:47.270
After 22 years.

57:49.630 --> 57:52.470
Well, I guess that's long enough
for anybody.

57:57.470 --> 58:00.990
You're gonna need that Kilgallen,
aren't you?

58:01.950 --> 58:03.350
I might.

58:06.030 --> 58:08.350
Well, if you do...

58:08.430 --> 58:10.750
you can forget
how I feel about him.

58:12.030 --> 58:14.030
Thanks.

58:14.110 --> 58:15.510
Kid?

58:16.430 --> 58:18.990
There's a lot of things you can do
around here to help me.

58:19.030 --> 58:21.470
Sure, I know.

58:21.550 --> 58:23.430
I can help Mike.

58:23.830 --> 58:25.230
I can...

58:28.790 --> 58:30.150
Sure.

59:08.630 --> 59:11.030
Calling MacPherson.

59:14.195 --> 59:15.155
Go ahead.

59:15.235 --> 59:16.355
Radio check.

59:16.395 --> 59:19.315
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

59:19.395 --> 59:21.235
Okay. Report when you get there.

59:58.115 --> 59:59.475
Fasten your belt.

01:00:01.475 --> 01:00:02.835
Your belt.

01:01:24.075 --> 01:01:25.435
Calling Barranca.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.635
- Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead.

01:01:27.715 --> 01:01:31.555
MacPherson speaking.
We got down all right.

01:01:31.635 --> 01:01:34.595
The doctor says we got to get
this fellow to the hospital right away.

01:01:34.675 --> 01:01:37.995
They're loading him in now.
His father's coming along, too.

01:01:39.835 --> 01:01:42.195
Can you get out of there
with that extra weight?

01:01:42.275 --> 01:01:44.995
I got a little help from the wind.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:48.395
I'll go off the ledge, and use
the canyon to pick up flying speed.

01:01:50.475 --> 01:01:52.795
Let me know if you make it.

01:01:56.235 --> 01:01:59.435
Brace yourselves and hang on to him.
This will be quite a drop.

01:02:47.955 --> 01:02:51.115
- Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead.

01:02:51.195 --> 01:02:54.875
MacPherson speaking. We got out
all right, all in one piece.

01:02:57.995 --> 01:03:00.755
What'd you want me to do,
pat you on the back?

01:03:00.835 --> 01:03:02.195
Signing off.

01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:11.635
Come in.

01:03:13.395 --> 01:03:15.755
Busy?

01:03:23.475 --> 01:03:24.995
It seems very natural.

01:03:25.075 --> 01:03:27.275
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

01:03:28.075 --> 01:03:31.355
- Like my hair this way?
- I thought it was different.

01:03:31.435 --> 01:03:33.915
I could hardly believe my eyes.
I had no idea...

01:03:33.995 --> 01:03:35.515
It's a small world.

01:03:35.595 --> 01:03:37.675
- Hello, Geoff.
- Hello, Judy.

01:03:38.755 --> 01:03:41.595
I'm not so sure
we should've done that.

01:03:43.395 --> 01:03:45.795
Same old goo.
You haven't changed a bit.

01:03:49.595 --> 01:03:52.155
Were you surprised
to find me married?

01:03:53.035 --> 01:03:56.595
No, somebody wrote me
something about it.

01:03:57.675 --> 01:04:00.995
I thought you'd had enough
of fliers.

01:04:01.075 --> 01:04:02.355
So did I.

01:04:02.435 --> 01:04:04.275
You getting along all right?

01:04:04.355 --> 01:04:06.195
I'm very happy.

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:11.875
Did you tell him about us?

01:04:13.595 --> 01:04:15.475
He never asked me.

01:04:18.235 --> 01:04:21.435
Judy, I wish you luck.
If there's anything I can do for you...

01:04:21.515 --> 01:04:24.115
While you're in the mood, would you
do something about our room?

01:04:24.195 --> 01:04:25.795
What's the matter with it?

01:04:25.835 --> 01:04:28.275
Remember the one I had
at Catalina?

01:04:28.355 --> 01:04:30.635
It's even smaller than that,
and no bath.

01:04:31.995 --> 01:04:34.635
Well, I'll do what I can.

01:04:39.395 --> 01:04:40.795
Mrs. MacPherson, Miss Lee.

01:04:40.875 --> 01:04:45.075
Miss Lee has to know everything. She'd
probably like to ask you some questions.

01:04:45.155 --> 01:04:47.075
I would not!

01:04:48.955 --> 01:04:50.315
Never mind!

01:04:54.035 --> 01:04:55.915
Still at it,
aren't you, Geoff?

01:04:55.955 --> 01:04:57.715
What?

01:04:57.795 --> 01:04:59.795
Oh, you mean...

01:04:59.875 --> 01:05:02.955
No, no. She's stopping over
between boats.

01:05:03.035 --> 01:05:06.195
- At your invitation?
- My invitation? I wouldn't ask any...

01:05:06.275 --> 01:05:08.235
Any woman to do anything.

01:05:09.035 --> 01:05:11.475
I've heard that before.

01:05:11.555 --> 01:05:13.755
You can't keep that up forever.

01:05:13.835 --> 01:05:16.315
You'll meet someone sometime
you'll have to ask.

01:05:16.395 --> 01:05:17.755
I haven't so far.

01:05:23.715 --> 01:05:26.035
Cut it out! Cut it out!

01:05:30.555 --> 01:05:31.915
You all right?

01:05:31.995 --> 01:05:33.475
Yeah, sure.

01:05:33.515 --> 01:05:35.675
- Take him in there.
- Come on, Kid.

01:05:37.955 --> 01:05:39.795
- You'll do.
- Thanks.

01:05:39.875 --> 01:05:42.635
Why don't you two pick on somebody
you can handle?

01:05:42.675 --> 01:05:45.515
- I think it's busted.
- Yeah?

01:05:46.675 --> 01:05:48.555
Try to move your fingers.

01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:51.515
Not a wiggle.

01:05:51.595 --> 01:05:53.435
That's fine. What started this?

01:05:53.515 --> 01:05:55.955
The Kid came in,
had a couple of drinks.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.675
Gent and I got to squawking
about working with this fellow Bat.

01:05:58.755 --> 01:06:00.595
- One thing led to another...
- Gonna quit?

01:06:00.675 --> 01:06:03.235
- That was the main idea.
- Next thing, I wound up on the floor.

01:06:03.275 --> 01:06:06.275
- That guy acted like he was crazy.
- You'd be crazy, too.

01:06:06.355 --> 01:06:09.955
- Why?
- I had to ground him.

01:06:09.995 --> 01:06:11.915
He's through flying.

01:06:13.395 --> 01:06:15.675
- Oh.
- His eyes?

01:06:17.995 --> 01:06:19.515
That's tough.

01:06:19.595 --> 01:06:21.515
No wonder he went nuts.

01:06:21.595 --> 01:06:25.835
- You better take that to the hospital.
- Just a minute. I want to talk to Kid.

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:27.275
Me, too.

01:06:27.995 --> 01:06:29.835
Mr. Peters?

01:06:29.875 --> 01:06:32.835
What did you say
about working with my husband?

01:06:32.875 --> 01:06:35.435
- I didn't say anything, did I?
- Why should you?

01:06:35.515 --> 01:06:37.915
I guess you misunderstood, lady.

01:06:46.315 --> 01:06:47.715
Look, Kid.

01:06:49.155 --> 01:06:53.515
We didn't know anything about...
Geoff just told us the bad news.

01:06:53.595 --> 01:06:55.915
Yeah? Still figure on quitting?

01:06:55.955 --> 01:06:59.275
I guess if you can stand that guy,
we've got no right to kick.

01:06:59.355 --> 01:07:01.555
Okay, forget it.

01:07:03.915 --> 01:07:06.715
I just didn't pick out
a good place to land.

01:07:06.795 --> 01:07:09.955
I'm sorry about that other thing.

01:07:09.995 --> 01:07:12.795
What about me? I didn't get this
by walking into a door.

01:07:12.875 --> 01:07:15.075
Kiss it and make it well.

01:07:15.115 --> 01:07:16.515
It's better already.

01:07:16.555 --> 01:07:20.035
Les, get that arm
down to the hospital right away.

01:07:20.115 --> 01:07:23.555
Well, you're another guy short.

01:07:23.635 --> 01:07:25.715
That's how it goes.

01:07:25.795 --> 01:07:28.475
I certainly am a great help to you.

01:07:28.555 --> 01:07:32.395
We'll get along all right.
Maybe I could teach Dutchy to fly.

01:07:32.475 --> 01:07:35.275
Who, me? No, no.
I don't want to.

01:07:35.355 --> 01:07:37.195
Who's running this airline?

01:07:37.275 --> 01:07:40.475
Geoff, please.
Include me out.

01:07:40.555 --> 01:07:43.035
It's not a bad idea.

01:07:43.115 --> 01:07:45.115
Geoff, I don't want to fly.

01:07:46.075 --> 01:07:47.795
Cheer up.

01:08:13.275 --> 01:08:16.875
Hartword said to give you this check.
If it's not satisfactory, let him know.

01:08:16.955 --> 01:08:19.595
Wait a minute.

01:08:19.675 --> 01:08:21.875
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

01:08:21.955 --> 01:08:25.675
- What about my passage money?
- You don't need it. You got the job.

01:08:32.115 --> 01:08:34.035
Maybe I oughta pat you on the back.

01:08:35.835 --> 01:08:38.635
You don't have to.
Just do what I tell you to do.

01:08:38.675 --> 01:08:42.715
You mean, anything that's a little
too tough for somebody else?

01:08:42.795 --> 01:08:46.354
Yeah. Yeah, that's about it.

01:08:46.435 --> 01:08:49.035
Look, I'm knee-deep in friends
around here...

01:08:49.075 --> 01:08:52.154
but you're one guy I can send out
in any kind of weather, on any job...

01:08:52.234 --> 01:08:54.515
and only worry about
the ship getting back.

01:08:55.595 --> 01:08:57.955
On those terms,
you still want the job?

01:08:59.915 --> 01:09:03.314
- I don't know any other way I'd want it.
- Good.

01:09:03.395 --> 01:09:05.795
Go out and look around the field.
Get acquainted.

01:09:05.835 --> 01:09:08.115
Anything you want to know,
ask Mike.

01:09:08.194 --> 01:09:11.795
And if he won't talk to you,
tell him it's orders.

01:09:13.194 --> 01:09:14.555
Yes, sir.

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:19.435
Dutch, come and get it.

01:09:19.475 --> 01:09:21.475
Now you can get that ship
out of hock.

01:09:21.555 --> 01:09:24.234
I'm afraid we need more than...

01:09:24.274 --> 01:09:27.435
- Isn't that too much?
- Not for that kind of flying.

01:09:27.515 --> 01:09:29.435
Geoff, I don't know.

01:09:29.515 --> 01:09:31.635
If you want to thank somebody,
thank him.

01:09:31.715 --> 01:09:33.995
One way you can do that
is to get him a decent room.

01:09:34.075 --> 01:09:36.715
- I haven't got a thing.
- What about the one on the balcony?

01:09:36.795 --> 01:09:39.234
Miss Lee is in that.

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:41.435
- Right next to me?
- I thought you...

01:09:41.515 --> 01:09:44.234
- Stop thinking. Get her out of there!
- If you want.

01:09:44.314 --> 01:09:47.274
- I do. But get the ship first.
- Yes.

01:09:47.354 --> 01:09:49.515
- Get it here as fast as you can.
- Sure.

01:10:01.355 --> 01:10:04.195
- Hello.
- Hello, Bonnie. How you doing?

01:10:04.235 --> 01:10:07.315
Oh, not bad...

01:10:07.395 --> 01:10:10.755
after spending the night in that
mouse auditorium I'm sleeping in.

01:10:10.835 --> 01:10:13.035
Just about enough room for me
and a flint gun.

01:10:13.115 --> 01:10:16.555
- I thought we'd fixed you up good.
- You did.

01:10:16.635 --> 01:10:19.515
Mr. Carter had other ideas.

01:10:20.235 --> 01:10:22.075
Well, you warned me.

01:10:23.795 --> 01:10:28.675
Say, isn't that girl the one
he used to be in love with?

01:10:28.755 --> 01:10:32.115
When it rains, every third drop
falls on one of them.

01:10:33.755 --> 01:10:37.195
I can believe that all right.
They come right out of the woodwork.

01:10:38.315 --> 01:10:39.675
More power to him.

01:10:39.755 --> 01:10:41.115
Oh, sure.

01:10:43.395 --> 01:10:46.195
You don't think I care anything
about that, do you?

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:48.155
Well, I don't. See?

01:10:50.035 --> 01:10:52.355
I'd like to tell him
what I think of him, that's all.

01:10:52.395 --> 01:10:55.395
All you have to do
is raise your voice a little.

01:10:58.315 --> 01:11:00.795
- Is that him?
- The old master himself.

01:11:04.315 --> 01:11:05.795
What's he doing?

01:11:05.835 --> 01:11:09.995
Testing a smashed-up plane that Mike
stuck together with a little glue.

01:11:10.035 --> 01:11:12.995
Or did you use baling wire this time?

01:11:13.075 --> 01:11:15.195
Don't worry.
Those wings will stay on.

01:11:15.275 --> 01:11:17.595
We'll soon find out.

01:11:52.235 --> 01:11:54.115
He's not trying to do that.

01:11:54.155 --> 01:11:56.675
- I can't see. What's happened?
- She's out of control.

01:12:12.635 --> 01:12:15.435
- He's out of it.
- There's your chance. Get out of her.

01:12:15.475 --> 01:12:17.595
Jump. What's he doing?

01:12:17.675 --> 01:12:20.235
- He's going to try to land.
- He can't make it.

01:12:20.315 --> 01:12:22.475
Get set for the crash, Mike!

01:12:22.555 --> 01:12:25.835
- Why doesn't he jump?
- Why should he? He's made of rubber.

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:28.475
- He wants to see how high he can bounce.
- Shut up!

01:12:46.635 --> 01:12:48.635
I'm getting too old for...

01:12:50.155 --> 01:12:52.355
What's the matter?

01:12:52.395 --> 01:12:54.075
I don't know.

01:12:54.155 --> 01:12:55.515
L...

01:13:06.395 --> 01:13:08.715
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

01:13:10.315 --> 01:13:11.675
Here.

01:13:12.875 --> 01:13:14.955
This is good for the stomach.

01:13:18.595 --> 01:13:20.515
It won't help
for what ails you.

01:13:20.595 --> 01:13:22.835
You didn't tell him
what a baby I was?

01:13:22.915 --> 01:13:24.995
No, I skipped that one.

01:13:25.875 --> 01:13:27.755
You won't tell him, will you?

01:13:27.835 --> 01:13:31.555
After that sample, have you still got
your chin stuck out for more?

01:13:31.595 --> 01:13:36.755
I know I'm a fool,
but I can't do anything about it.

01:13:36.835 --> 01:13:42.355
- He won't quit flying, Bonnie.
- I wouldn't ask him to.

01:13:42.435 --> 01:13:44.715
You don't believe that, do you?

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:47.195
You'll have a hard time
making him believe it.

01:13:47.275 --> 01:13:50.075
Think you can take that sort of thing
day after day?

01:13:53.555 --> 01:13:56.155
You love him, don't you?

01:13:57.915 --> 01:13:59.915
Yes, I guess I do.

01:13:59.995 --> 01:14:01.915
Why can't I love him
the way you do?

01:14:01.995 --> 01:14:05.115
Why couldn't I sneer
when he tries to kill himself...

01:14:05.195 --> 01:14:07.275
feel proud when he doesn't?

01:14:07.355 --> 01:14:10.715
Why couldn't I be there to meet him
when he gets back? Why couldn't l...

01:14:13.555 --> 01:14:17.075
What do you do when he doesn't come back
when you expect him to?

01:14:18.115 --> 01:14:20.035
I go nuts.

01:14:23.035 --> 01:14:26.435
Gee whiz, you're a great help.

01:14:34.555 --> 01:14:36.915
- That's fine.
- What's up?

01:14:36.995 --> 01:14:41.515
They report a low formed over the ocean.
It's going to bring that storm here.

01:14:41.555 --> 01:14:44.595
- When do they expect it?
- We might get the first tonight.

01:14:44.675 --> 01:14:46.955
- How big?
- Don't know. I'll get more dope later.

01:14:46.995 --> 01:14:49.915
Fine time for dirty weather.
Poor Dutchy.

01:14:49.995 --> 01:14:53.515
No use moaning about that.
Help Mike and Pancho with that new ship.

01:14:53.595 --> 01:14:56.355
- What good is that if the storm hits?
- Tell them to stay with it all night.

01:14:56.395 --> 01:14:59.235
Someday I'll get a straight answer,
and I won't know what to do with it.

01:14:59.275 --> 01:15:01.155
Geoff, wait a minute.

01:15:01.195 --> 01:15:03.755
- What?
- They're loading #8 with nitroglycerin.

01:15:03.835 --> 01:15:07.915
You're taking it to the oil fields.
Baldy, anything you've got.

01:15:07.955 --> 01:15:11.315
- We shouldn't fly that with the mail.
- I know.

01:15:11.395 --> 01:15:13.675
Nothing in my contract says
I'll fly nitroglycerin.

01:15:13.755 --> 01:15:16.995
- You get a buck and a half to do it.
- Not me.

01:15:17.035 --> 01:15:21.235
- What?
- Listen, I saw a guy blow a tire once.

01:15:21.315 --> 01:15:24.155
I was down the other end of the field,
and it broke a bottle in my pocket.

01:15:24.235 --> 01:15:26.275
Where's your map?

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.555
- I don't like that stuff.
- Who does?

01:15:28.635 --> 01:15:31.435
- I'll do anything else.
- I know.

01:15:32.475 --> 01:15:34.515
Here you are, MacPherson.

01:15:39.955 --> 01:15:43.275
Once you're through the pass,
the oil fields are 200 miles north.

01:15:47.515 --> 01:15:49.435
Give me a match, Dutch.

01:15:51.995 --> 01:15:54.875
You weren't kidding me the other day,
were you?

01:15:58.875 --> 01:16:02.675
- Dutch, figure out Gent's time.
- What?

01:16:02.755 --> 01:16:04.995
- You're through.
- What's the matter with you?

01:16:05.035 --> 01:16:08.715
- You can't blame that boy.
- I'm not blaming him. He's fired.

01:16:08.755 --> 01:16:12.675
- Sorry, Gent.
- No, I don't like that. The way...

01:16:12.715 --> 01:16:16.475
How about clearing the field
before MacPherson takes off?

01:16:16.555 --> 01:16:17.915
Nitro.

01:16:17.995 --> 01:16:20.235
My goodness, yes!
You said it.

01:16:20.315 --> 01:16:22.995
I didn't think of that at all.

01:16:28.075 --> 01:16:31.115
- How's this stuff packed?
- All in rubber.

01:16:31.155 --> 01:16:33.755
Here's a trap door
if you want to get rid of it.

01:16:33.835 --> 01:16:35.195
Thanks.

01:17:49.435 --> 01:17:51.555
None of that stuff for me.

01:18:01.195 --> 01:18:03.715
- Watch it for a minute, will you?
- Sure.

01:18:06.275 --> 01:18:09.195
- Hello, Judy.
- I'd like to talk to you.

01:18:09.275 --> 01:18:13.155
- What's on your mind?
- Bat. He's carrying nitroglycerin.

01:18:13.235 --> 01:18:17.555
- Don't worry about it. He's good.
- I know, but it's dangerous.

01:18:17.635 --> 01:18:20.555
Not while he's in the air it isn't.
Run along. Let Bat do the worrying.

01:18:20.635 --> 01:18:23.195
Don't be like that with me.

01:18:23.275 --> 01:18:26.675
Why does he always get things
like this to do? Please, Geoff!

01:18:26.755 --> 01:18:31.555
I told you I was happy, but I lied.
Why don't people want to work with him?

01:18:31.635 --> 01:18:34.715
What's he done that makes people act
the way they do?

01:18:34.795 --> 01:18:36.835
- Why ask me?
- You're the only one I can.

01:18:36.915 --> 01:18:38.915
Please! I've got to know.

01:18:38.995 --> 01:18:42.195
- Can't you see what...
- Calling Barranca.

01:18:42.275 --> 01:18:44.355
- Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead.

01:18:44.435 --> 01:18:48.755
Wind's coming up. Doesn't look good.
It's closing in fast.

01:18:48.835 --> 01:18:50.875
Yeah? Have you seen MacPherson yet?

01:18:50.955 --> 01:18:53.195
Went by a couple minutes ago.

01:18:53.275 --> 01:18:56.435
All right. Calling MacPherson!

01:18:56.515 --> 01:18:59.755
- You'd better run along.
- No, I'm staying.

01:18:59.795 --> 01:19:01.195
Calling MacPherson.

01:19:06.635 --> 01:19:10.035
- Is your weather good or bad?
- There's a chance to get through.

01:19:10.115 --> 01:19:11.995
I didn't ask that.
Is it good or bad?

01:19:12.075 --> 01:19:13.915
- Bad.
- Turn around and come back.

01:19:23.035 --> 01:19:24.955
When you're in the clear,
dump that nitro.

01:19:25.035 --> 01:19:27.315
I can get this down all right.

01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:30.355
You heard me. I said dump it! And
watch yourself while you're doing it.

01:19:30.435 --> 01:19:32.795
There's a flock of birds in the pass.

01:19:32.875 --> 01:19:35.715
Look like condors. Why not have him
drop that soup on them?

01:19:35.755 --> 01:19:38.475
- Not a bad idea. You hear, MacPherson?
- Yeah.

01:19:38.555 --> 01:19:40.515
Tex will line you up.

01:19:42.155 --> 01:19:45.475
- Feeling better, Judy?
- Thanks, Geoff.

01:19:45.515 --> 01:19:48.875
Now will you tell me
what he's done?

01:19:48.955 --> 01:19:51.635
No, you'll have to ask him.

01:19:54.315 --> 01:19:56.635
You think that'll be easy to do?

01:20:20.635 --> 01:20:24.075
Keep on the left, and start dropping
after you pass that second peak.

01:20:35.355 --> 01:20:38.635
That oughta move 'em!
Drop the rest before you get back.

01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:57.435
Too bad I couldn't get through.
I left the mail on the ship.

01:20:57.515 --> 01:21:00.555
Stand by. You're taking it up again
as soon as Tex clears you.

01:21:13.515 --> 01:21:16.875
Calling Lookout.

01:21:17.795 --> 01:21:19.155
Go ahead.

01:21:19.235 --> 01:21:21.115
MacPherson speaking.

01:21:21.195 --> 01:21:24.115
An hour out of Las Cruces.
Clear ahead.

01:21:24.195 --> 01:21:26.915
- Clear here.
- Signing off.

01:21:26.955 --> 01:21:30.315
Calling Barranca.

01:21:30.395 --> 01:21:33.155
- Go ahead.
- MacPherson coming back.

01:21:33.195 --> 01:21:36.395
- An hour out of Las Cruces.
- Okay, Tex.

01:21:36.435 --> 01:21:39.115
When he gets back, only one more trip
and you've got your contract.

01:21:39.195 --> 01:21:41.035
Yeah, only one more trip.

01:21:41.115 --> 01:21:43.555
If this rain keeps up,
we're gonna need pontoons.

01:21:44.915 --> 01:21:47.115
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

01:21:47.195 --> 01:21:50.035
Get those motors ready.
I want to run a test on 'em.

01:21:56.075 --> 01:21:57.435
Hello.

01:21:59.755 --> 01:22:02.555
- What are you doing here?
- Just looking for a corkscrew.

01:22:02.635 --> 01:22:04.955
Don't you think
you'd better get some sleep?

01:22:05.035 --> 01:22:07.755
Seems like an excellent suggestion.

01:22:07.795 --> 01:22:10.195
Look what I won on the punchboard.
We'll make a nightcap out of it...

01:22:10.275 --> 01:22:13.155
as soon as I can find a corkscrew.

01:22:15.595 --> 01:22:17.715
Lock the doors.
Judy's lost her equilibrium.

01:22:19.755 --> 01:22:23.515
Yeah. You're apt to lose something else
if you put that stuff on top of it.

01:22:23.595 --> 01:22:26.315
I don't care.
I'm getting used to losing things.

01:22:27.835 --> 01:22:29.835
Did you ask him?

01:22:29.915 --> 01:22:31.875
That why you're celebrating?

01:22:33.355 --> 01:22:36.355
He wouldn't tell me.
Said it had nothing to do with us.

01:22:36.435 --> 01:22:38.475
It's seems that that's that.

01:22:38.555 --> 01:22:40.755
It's all over.

01:22:40.835 --> 01:22:44.035
You're going to let him go it
all by himself, huh?

01:22:44.075 --> 01:22:45.955
Did you ever hear the word "trust"?

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:50.155
I did once, but I forgot it.

01:22:51.235 --> 01:22:54.115
I don't blame him
for not telling you.

01:22:54.155 --> 01:22:56.955
Maybe he wanted to find out
what he'd got.

01:22:57.035 --> 01:22:59.395
You're no good, and you never were.
Give me that thing.

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:02.035
Give me that
before you cut your hand.

01:23:02.115 --> 01:23:05.875
I used to wonder if I was right
when we broke up.

01:23:05.955 --> 01:23:07.795
I don't have to worry
about it anymore.

01:23:07.875 --> 01:23:09.355
What did I do?

01:23:09.435 --> 01:23:11.675
You don't know what
I'm talking about, do you?

01:23:11.755 --> 01:23:14.875
You've got some listening to do, and I'm
gonna make sure you hear every word.

01:23:21.475 --> 01:23:24.155
It'll do you good.

01:23:24.235 --> 01:23:27.115
What do you care what he did?
Why do you have to know all about it?

01:23:27.195 --> 01:23:29.395
Come here. Wipe your eyes.

01:23:29.475 --> 01:23:31.675
If it's so bad he can't tell you,
how do you think he feels?

01:23:31.755 --> 01:23:33.755
Why don't you think
of his side of it?

01:23:33.835 --> 01:23:36.635
You're just like all the rest.
You don't know what it means to stick.

01:23:36.715 --> 01:23:39.035
Blow your nose.
You're all right.

01:23:42.195 --> 01:23:44.315
Go to bed.

01:24:04.515 --> 01:24:07.195
Hey, you! Don't come in!

01:24:07.275 --> 01:24:10.715
- What are you doing here?
- Taking a bath.

01:24:10.795 --> 01:24:13.635
I know that.
You've got a nerve!

01:24:13.675 --> 01:24:17.475
- You can't take a bath in a wash basin.
- Why pick my room?

01:24:17.555 --> 01:24:20.035
It's the only clean one I could find.
I'll be out in a minute.

01:24:20.115 --> 01:24:22.795
- Hurry it up, will ya?
- I'm hurrying.

01:24:22.835 --> 01:24:24.715
- What's all this?
- What?

01:24:24.755 --> 01:24:27.875
- All this cooking!
- That's coffee.

01:24:27.915 --> 01:24:30.435
Don't touch it. It's hot.
You'll burn yourself.

01:24:30.515 --> 01:24:32.875
- I told you. Let me see.
- Go away. Go away.

01:24:32.915 --> 01:24:37.155
- That is a burn. Put butter on it.
- I don't want butter on it!

01:24:37.195 --> 01:24:41.195
- My grandmother always used butter.
- I don't care. It's still boiling.

01:24:42.675 --> 01:24:45.355
- What's this all about?
- I wanted a nice cup of coffee.

01:24:45.435 --> 01:24:48.435
It's cold and rainy outside,
and nice and warm and cozy in here.

01:24:48.515 --> 01:24:51.635
- Wouldn't you like to have one?
- No, I wouldn't. Get out of here.

01:24:51.715 --> 01:24:54.515
- Take this thing with you.
- Oh, don't...

01:24:56.235 --> 01:24:58.715
- I thought you never did that.
- Did what?

01:24:58.795 --> 01:25:01.115
Got burned twice in the same place.

01:25:09.275 --> 01:25:11.115
Geoff, I want...

01:25:11.195 --> 01:25:14.435
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'll go.
- It's all right.

01:25:15.875 --> 01:25:18.515
- Maybe I'd better go.
- No, please don't.

01:25:19.515 --> 01:25:21.355
I didn't intend to.

01:25:21.435 --> 01:25:24.275
You don't understand.
I wanted to thank Geoff for something.

01:25:24.355 --> 01:25:26.955
There's no reason for you
not to know.

01:25:27.035 --> 01:25:29.195
You were right. I'm no good.

01:25:29.275 --> 01:25:32.755
I was only thinking of myself,
not how to help him.

01:25:34.435 --> 01:25:37.235
I'm glad you didn't tell me what
he's done. I don't ever want to know.

01:25:37.315 --> 01:25:40.395
- I just want another chance.
- Why don't you tell him that?

01:25:40.475 --> 01:25:44.235
- I will. When will he be back?
- Two or three hours.

01:25:44.315 --> 01:25:46.275
That's a long time.

01:25:46.355 --> 01:25:49.515
If it's too long, tell Sparks I said
you could talk to him on the radio.

01:25:49.595 --> 01:25:50.795
Thanks.

01:26:02.795 --> 01:26:04.755
I knew you ran everything here...

01:26:04.835 --> 01:26:08.115
but I didn't know you had
a matrimonial agency on the side.

01:26:09.475 --> 01:26:11.835
Just goes to show you
how wrong you can be.

01:26:14.595 --> 01:26:16.435
Where do you keep those pictures?

01:26:17.995 --> 01:26:19.395
What pictures?

01:26:19.435 --> 01:26:21.955
Those pictures of you
when you were a baby.

01:26:23.755 --> 01:26:25.635
We're right back
where we started.

01:26:25.675 --> 01:26:27.955
That was a million years ago.
I know you better now.

01:26:28.035 --> 01:26:31.115
- What's the matter with your foot?
- I slipped on the porch.

01:26:31.155 --> 01:26:35.555
- Don't walk around on it.
- There's nothing the matter with it.

01:26:35.595 --> 01:26:37.475
- Let me put you down.
- It's not sprained.

01:26:37.515 --> 01:26:40.235
I just lost the heel
off my slipper, that's all.

01:26:41.075 --> 01:26:42.955
Why didn't you say so?

01:26:42.995 --> 01:26:46.555
Don't I have the darndest luck,
losing one heel right after another?

01:26:47.635 --> 01:26:50.515
- You're a queer duck.
- So are you.

01:27:02.595 --> 01:27:05.395
Geoff, you don't have to be
afraid of me anymore.

01:27:06.635 --> 01:27:09.515
I'm not trying to tie you down.

01:27:09.595 --> 01:27:12.675
I don't want to plan or look ahead.

01:27:12.715 --> 01:27:15.715
I don't want you to change anything.

01:27:15.795 --> 01:27:18.235
I love you, Geoff.
There's nothing I can do about it.

01:27:18.315 --> 01:27:20.155
I just love you.

01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:24.675
I feel the way about you that Kid does.
Anything you do is all right with me.

01:27:24.715 --> 01:27:26.235
The Kid?

01:27:26.315 --> 01:27:31.235
He doesn't ask you for anything, or
get in your way or bother you, does he?

01:27:31.275 --> 01:27:33.155
Drives me nuts.

01:27:34.555 --> 01:27:35.915
Hey, Geoff!

01:27:40.275 --> 01:27:42.155
Oh, sure. Come in.

01:27:43.435 --> 01:27:45.035
Sorry.

01:27:45.115 --> 01:27:48.715
Sure, come in. We might as well be
in Grand Central Station.

01:27:48.755 --> 01:27:51.475
I could've made a fortune
with a hot dog stand right here.

01:27:51.555 --> 01:27:54.435
I'm sorry. The boys are ready
to test those motors.

01:27:54.475 --> 01:27:56.075
Oh, all right.

01:27:56.155 --> 01:27:59.395
Will you have yours with mustard?
Or perhaps mustard and no hot dog.

01:27:59.435 --> 01:28:01.755
This has got to be done, Bonnie.

01:28:01.835 --> 01:28:05.075
Here you are. See if you can find it.
It's somewhere in that box.

01:28:05.155 --> 01:28:08.555
- What?
- That picture we were talking about.

01:28:08.635 --> 01:28:11.715
And keep the coffee warm, will ya?

01:28:11.755 --> 01:28:14.075
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

01:28:35.115 --> 01:28:38.155
- Boat's in.
- Thanks. I heard it.

01:28:38.235 --> 01:28:39.595
Calling Lookout.

01:28:39.675 --> 01:28:41.035
Calling Lookout.

01:28:45.835 --> 01:28:48.075
- Go ahead.
- Stand by. The boat's here.

01:28:48.115 --> 01:28:51.795
- #4 taking off when the mail comes.
- You can't get through this stuff.

01:28:51.875 --> 01:28:56.035
- We'll try to go over the top.
- That doesn't sound good to me.

01:28:56.075 --> 01:28:58.955
I almost forgot.
I need another generator belt.

01:28:58.995 --> 01:29:01.595
- What happened?
- Napoleon ate a piece out of the spare.

01:29:01.675 --> 01:29:03.315
What's he doing in there?

01:29:03.395 --> 01:29:05.835
I brought him in
to keep him from blowing away.

01:29:05.915 --> 01:29:08.555
- Rig up something yourself.
- With what?

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:11.435
Don't ask me.
Take a piece out of Napoleon's hide.

01:29:11.475 --> 01:29:13.355
Okay, I'll find something.

01:29:14.795 --> 01:29:17.115
- All set out there?
- All ready.

01:29:17.195 --> 01:29:20.955
Can't do any more. Took out
all the seats, stripped it clean.

01:29:21.035 --> 01:29:24.315
- Fine.
- Yeah, I got 400 pounds.

01:29:24.395 --> 01:29:26.955
You know, that's more than twice
what I weigh.

01:29:28.395 --> 01:29:30.235
Oh, yeah.

01:29:30.315 --> 01:29:32.395
I don't suppose
there's anything else you can do.

01:29:32.475 --> 01:29:35.115
- Now, look here, Geoff.
- I heard you the first time.

01:29:35.155 --> 01:29:37.515
- You're not going. Forget it.
- Why not?

01:29:37.555 --> 01:29:40.515
I'll toss you a coin for it.
Heads, I go.

01:29:42.835 --> 01:29:44.235
Everybody off.

01:29:46.155 --> 01:29:47.635
Wait. Go away.

01:29:48.755 --> 01:29:51.595
- Why are you so anxious about this?
- I'm not anxious.

01:29:57.715 --> 01:29:59.955
How do you like that?
Heads on both sides.

01:30:00.035 --> 01:30:01.915
Really? No kidding?

01:30:06.075 --> 01:30:08.515
- That's right, it is.
- "That's right, it is."

01:30:08.595 --> 01:30:11.115
No wonder I'll be buying you drinks
all year.

01:30:12.635 --> 01:30:16.355
I wanna go with you, Pop.
Please.

01:30:20.235 --> 01:30:23.235
- Okay, if you feel that way about it.
- Gimme, gimme.

01:30:24.515 --> 01:30:26.795
Put another bottle of oxygen
in the ship.

01:30:26.835 --> 01:30:28.995
I already did.

01:30:32.075 --> 01:30:34.195
- I'll take a cup of that, Charlie.
- Yes, sir.

01:30:35.395 --> 01:30:38.835
- Who went down to meet the boat?
- Why ask me?

01:30:38.915 --> 01:30:42.275
What have I got to do with it? You are
running this airline, aren't you?

01:30:42.315 --> 01:30:44.195
- MacPherson's gone to pick up the mail.
- Good.

01:30:44.235 --> 01:30:46.555
For your information,
I want to ask you a question.

01:30:46.635 --> 01:30:49.675
Don't you think you're crazy
to fly in that kind of weather?

01:30:49.755 --> 01:30:52.675
- Get the lights ready on the field.
- I told you so many times I don't...

01:30:52.755 --> 01:30:56.115
Whatever you do, don't think
you have to do it for me.

01:30:56.195 --> 01:30:59.235
I know what it means,
but I'd rather be broke.

01:30:59.315 --> 01:31:01.675
I don't care whether we get
that contract or not. Understand?

01:31:01.715 --> 01:31:03.835
Don't strain yourself, Dutch. Here.

01:31:03.915 --> 01:31:05.275
What's the use?

01:31:16.075 --> 01:31:17.435
Hello, Bonnie.

01:31:22.835 --> 01:31:24.235
What's this?

01:31:24.275 --> 01:31:26.755
I started that lunch wagon
we were talking about.

01:31:26.795 --> 01:31:29.435
Be careful of the coffee.
It was hot when I put it in...

01:31:29.515 --> 01:31:32.115
so don't burn yourself again.

01:31:32.195 --> 01:31:33.675
Thanks, Bonnie.

01:31:33.755 --> 01:31:35.675
Have a nice trip, Geoff.

01:31:36.555 --> 01:31:38.595
See you next week, 2:00.

01:31:38.635 --> 01:31:40.035
Yeah.

01:31:41.435 --> 01:31:43.315
- Where're you going?
- To the room.

01:31:43.395 --> 01:31:45.075
What for?

01:31:45.155 --> 01:31:47.595
My boat's in.
I've got to finish packing.

01:31:49.315 --> 01:31:50.675
Oh, yeah.

01:31:58.915 --> 01:32:01.235
Isn't that the outfit
you came ashore in?

01:32:01.315 --> 01:32:03.235
How'd you remember that?

01:32:06.115 --> 01:32:08.115
Got a match?

01:32:08.195 --> 01:32:11.435
Don't you think it's about time
you started carrying some?

01:32:20.075 --> 01:32:23.195
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to be so silly.

01:32:23.275 --> 01:32:26.155
I wanted to do this
just the way you do.

01:32:27.235 --> 01:32:30.515
I was all right until you asked
for that match, wasn't I?

01:32:30.595 --> 01:32:33.915
- You sure were.
- Just remember it up till then.

01:32:35.275 --> 01:32:40.075
Look, Bonnie, are you sorry
about anything?

01:32:40.155 --> 01:32:42.035
- Are you?
- No.

01:32:42.115 --> 01:32:43.475
I'm not.

01:32:46.435 --> 01:32:48.315
So long, Bonnie.

01:32:50.715 --> 01:32:53.835
Geoff, I can't let you go.

01:32:53.875 --> 01:32:55.835
This has got to stop.

01:32:55.915 --> 01:32:57.515
No, I can't.

01:32:57.595 --> 01:32:59.115
Come on.

01:32:59.195 --> 01:33:01.275
I won't let you go.

01:33:02.875 --> 01:33:05.035
You're not going to go.
You're going to stay right here.

01:33:05.115 --> 01:33:07.195
I won't let you kill yourself.

01:33:08.195 --> 01:33:10.635
You're going to do it
to keep me from doing it?

01:33:11.595 --> 01:33:13.595
You're just like all the rest.

01:33:13.675 --> 01:33:15.035
No, I'm not!

01:33:21.315 --> 01:33:23.875
- What have I done?
- Go away, Bonnie!

01:33:23.955 --> 01:33:27.395
- Darling, I didn't mean to.
- I know. It's my own fault.

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:29.835
- What's going on?
- He's shot.

01:33:31.355 --> 01:33:34.435
- Where's the first aid kit?
- Over in the corner. Does this hurt?

01:33:37.675 --> 01:33:40.115
Did you send for the doctor?
Get him right away.

01:33:40.195 --> 01:33:42.075
- Who did this?
- I did.

01:33:42.155 --> 01:33:44.635
- How'd it happen?
- I didn't want him to go.

01:33:44.715 --> 01:33:48.435
- Well, he's not likely to now.
- That sure looks bad.

01:33:48.515 --> 01:33:51.155
What is this, a sideshow?
Clear out of here. Go on.

01:33:51.235 --> 01:33:54.035
Don't get excited.
Get me a drink, will ya?

01:33:54.115 --> 01:33:57.875
Put some water on the stove.
Hold that, Sparks.

01:33:57.955 --> 01:34:00.475
It didn't come through.
It's still in there.

01:34:00.555 --> 01:34:03.955
- Here you are, Geoff.
- Thanks. What do you say, Kid?

01:34:04.035 --> 01:34:06.795
It's all right, but you're not
gonna do much flying with it.

01:34:06.835 --> 01:34:09.675
- You're crazy.
- Am I? Try to move it.

01:34:10.915 --> 01:34:14.155
- You've joined the rest of us cripples.
- Soon there'll be none of us left.

01:34:14.235 --> 01:34:16.035
Perfect.

01:34:16.075 --> 01:34:18.435
You don't think I can fly her alone,
do you?

01:34:18.475 --> 01:34:20.475
You're not good enough alone.

01:34:28.355 --> 01:34:30.555
I'm a lot better than anyone
you've got left.

01:34:37.515 --> 01:34:41.795
- How you gonna get through that stuff?
- Over the top in the new trimotor.

01:34:41.835 --> 01:34:44.035
- Will she go that high?
- I don't know.

01:34:44.075 --> 01:34:46.035
I'll see that you find out.

01:34:46.115 --> 01:34:47.955
Kid was going with me.

01:34:48.035 --> 01:34:52.515
- You think I might get lost, don't you?
- I'll see that you don't.

01:34:52.555 --> 01:34:55.795
You don't have to go.
It's not that kind of job.

01:34:55.875 --> 01:34:58.275
That's fair enough.

01:34:58.355 --> 01:35:01.035
There's the mail. I'll see you
on the field in five minutes.

01:35:01.075 --> 01:35:02.875
I'll be waiting for you.

01:35:15.995 --> 01:35:18.315
There's a parachute, if you want it.

01:35:26.835 --> 01:35:28.235
It's okay.

01:35:38.475 --> 01:35:39.875
All clear.

01:36:12.715 --> 01:36:14.635
He'd rather take that out
at the hospital.

01:36:14.715 --> 01:36:18.235
- Tell him to probe for it here.
- Calling Barranca.

01:36:18.315 --> 01:36:19.675
Calling Barranca.

01:36:21.595 --> 01:36:23.515
All right. Go ahead.

01:36:23.595 --> 01:36:25.635
Thirty-five hundred.

01:36:27.915 --> 01:36:30.995
Still on instruments.

01:36:57.755 --> 01:36:59.155
Calling Barranca.

01:37:02.275 --> 01:37:03.635
Eight thousand.

01:37:05.715 --> 01:37:07.595
On top first layer.

01:37:25.355 --> 01:37:26.755
Calling Barranca.

01:37:28.875 --> 01:37:31.675
Fourteen thousand.

01:37:31.755 --> 01:37:36.115
Picking up a little ice.
Free to climb three-twenty.

01:38:24.155 --> 01:38:27.675
Barranca. Calling Barranca.

01:38:27.755 --> 01:38:30.395
Fifteen thousand, six hundred.

01:38:30.635 --> 01:38:32.995
Fair sailing.

01:38:35.035 --> 01:38:39.675
Okay, Papa. Never saw one of these yet
could go through the side of a mountain.

01:38:48.155 --> 01:38:49.515
There she goes!

01:39:05.315 --> 01:39:07.195
What have we got under us?

01:39:07.275 --> 01:39:09.635
You're safe till 6,000.

01:39:09.715 --> 01:39:12.075
I'll wait till the air's heavier.

01:39:35.115 --> 01:39:38.315
- You want me to try it again?
- No use.

01:39:38.355 --> 01:39:41.235
She's not good enough
by more than a thousand feet.

01:39:42.955 --> 01:39:44.355
Calling Barranca.

01:39:44.395 --> 01:39:46.275
- Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead.

01:39:46.315 --> 01:39:50.755
Tell Geoff we couldn't make it.
Gof to 16,000 and the bottom fell out.

01:39:50.835 --> 01:39:53.995
- Tell them to come back.
- Heard you. Not coming back.

01:39:54.035 --> 01:39:55.995
Going through fhe pass.

01:39:56.075 --> 01:39:58.355
Don't be a fool.
Tex says it's closed in tight.

01:39:58.435 --> 01:40:01.555
I've been flying in a blind
for two months.

01:40:01.635 --> 01:40:04.075
Won't do any harm
to do it once more.

01:40:04.155 --> 01:40:08.035
- Come back. Those are orders. Hear?
- No dice.

01:40:08.075 --> 01:40:09.475
Signing off.

01:40:10.435 --> 01:40:12.555
- Tell Tex to watch for 'em.
- Calling Lookout.

01:40:12.635 --> 01:40:15.635
- Go ahead.
- Watch for #4. They'll try the pass.

01:40:15.715 --> 01:40:17.795
They can't make it.
It's closed in thicker than glue.

01:40:17.875 --> 01:40:20.075
All clear below.

01:40:20.155 --> 01:40:22.635
Get in one of those chutes and jump.

01:40:27.195 --> 01:40:30.235
Is there any reason I can't go, too?

01:40:30.315 --> 01:40:32.155
You don't have to.

01:40:34.355 --> 01:40:36.715
Which way is the pass from here?

01:40:37.835 --> 01:40:40.315
Ten degrees north...

01:40:40.395 --> 01:40:42.275
three thousand up.

01:41:03.955 --> 01:41:06.635
I can hear 'em.
They're starting through.

01:41:06.715 --> 01:41:08.555
They're in the pass now.

01:41:22.155 --> 01:41:23.995
Kid, answer.

01:41:26.955 --> 01:41:28.875
- Calling Barranca.
- Go ahead.

01:41:28.955 --> 01:41:32.675
They just went by, feeling their way.
I tried to falk fo them, but no answer.

01:41:32.715 --> 01:41:34.715
Keep trying.

01:42:03.555 --> 01:42:05.475
Kid! Kid!

01:42:27.755 --> 01:42:30.635
- Yeah?
- Get out quick and jump!

01:42:31.955 --> 01:42:34.715
Something broken. Can't move.

01:42:35.675 --> 01:42:37.035
Jump yourself.

01:42:37.115 --> 01:42:38.475
Not this time.

01:42:39.715 --> 01:42:41.635
Oh, you fool!

01:42:49.035 --> 01:42:52.115
Geoff, #4's on fire.
Left outboard and nose motor.

01:42:52.195 --> 01:42:54.115
I don't think they can make it.

01:42:54.155 --> 01:42:57.555
Plug in that outside set.
Give me a coat!

01:43:04.075 --> 01:43:06.875
Turn on the lights to the field.

01:43:11.555 --> 01:43:13.435
Calling #4.

01:43:18.675 --> 01:43:20.555
- Calling #4.
- Look, there they are!

01:43:23.475 --> 01:43:25.835
She's coming down!

01:43:25.875 --> 01:43:28.155
#4, jump! Bail out!

01:43:47.635 --> 01:43:50.595
- Get the mail!
- All right. Grab this mail.

01:43:52.235 --> 01:43:54.395
Take it easy. He's hurt bad.

01:44:26.155 --> 01:44:27.555
Come on.

01:44:33.355 --> 01:44:35.675
Okay, Doc, that's fine.

01:44:35.755 --> 01:44:37.515
Cut it out. Come on.

01:44:37.595 --> 01:44:40.675
Tell this guy to stop fussing with me.
I'm all right.

01:44:40.715 --> 01:44:42.915
Let him alone, Doc.

01:44:43.555 --> 01:44:45.155
Cigarette, Papa?

01:44:45.235 --> 01:44:46.755
Sure. Here.

01:44:51.795 --> 01:44:54.075
How's the other guy?

01:44:54.155 --> 01:44:56.355
Hands burned,
and one side of his face.

01:44:56.395 --> 01:44:58.275
He's all right, Geoff.

01:44:58.315 --> 01:45:00.355
Could've jumped but he didn't.

01:45:00.435 --> 01:45:03.475
Just sat right there. Took it
like it was an ice cream soda.

01:45:05.035 --> 01:45:07.835
- Buy him a drink for me, will ya?
- Sure, I will.

01:45:09.835 --> 01:45:12.235
Hadn't been for those birds,
we'd have made it.

01:45:12.315 --> 01:45:14.195
Sure you would.

01:45:14.275 --> 01:45:19.155
I'd make a windshield at an angle,
and they'd bounce off.

01:45:19.235 --> 01:45:20.675
Not a bad idea.

01:45:20.715 --> 01:45:23.315
Make you a present of the profit.

01:45:23.395 --> 01:45:25.955
When I get on my feet,
we'll work it out.

01:45:28.675 --> 01:45:30.035
L...

01:45:33.395 --> 01:45:35.275
Your neck's broken, Kid.

01:45:38.315 --> 01:45:39.675
Funny.

01:45:41.715 --> 01:45:45.555
Wondered why
I couldn't feel anything.

01:45:47.915 --> 01:45:51.835
Well, guess this is it.

01:45:57.195 --> 01:45:58.555
That's...

01:46:01.755 --> 01:46:04.555
- What is it?
- Get that bunch out of here quick!

01:46:04.595 --> 01:46:06.675
Get out, hurry up.

01:46:06.755 --> 01:46:08.675
You, too, Doc.
Use both feet.

01:46:12.555 --> 01:46:15.635
What is it, fella?
Come on, you can tell me.

01:46:15.715 --> 01:46:18.555
- I didn't want them to see me.
- Sure, sure.

01:46:18.635 --> 01:46:20.715
- I'm not scared, Geoff.
- Of course you're not.

01:46:20.795 --> 01:46:22.635
It's just that...

01:46:23.675 --> 01:46:26.035
it's like doing something new...

01:46:27.395 --> 01:46:30.835
like when I made
my first solo.

01:46:32.075 --> 01:46:34.395
I didn't want anybody
watching then, either.

01:46:34.475 --> 01:46:35.835
Yeah.

01:46:36.635 --> 01:46:39.155
I don't know how good
I'm gonna be at this.

01:46:40.835 --> 01:46:42.675
Do you want me to go, too?

01:46:43.955 --> 01:46:46.675
I'd hate to pull a boner
in front of you, Geoff.

01:46:48.755 --> 01:46:51.275
Sure.
Sure, I know.

01:46:51.355 --> 01:46:53.195
Here you are.

01:46:58.875 --> 01:47:00.235
So long, Kid.

01:47:00.315 --> 01:47:01.675
So long, Geoff.

01:47:20.595 --> 01:47:21.995
Hi, Dutch.

01:47:32.075 --> 01:47:34.035
Got a match?

01:47:55.955 --> 01:47:57.355
Well, this...

01:48:00.675 --> 01:48:02.635
Here. The final paychecks.

01:48:03.755 --> 01:48:05.875
The field is closed down.

01:48:05.955 --> 01:48:07.555
We are licked.

01:48:07.635 --> 01:48:09.035
Okay, Dutchy.

01:48:15.475 --> 01:48:18.115
Calling Lookout.

01:48:18.195 --> 01:48:19.675
Go ahead, Geoff.

01:48:19.755 --> 01:48:22.675
Let me know when it clears, Tex.
We're all set down here.

01:48:22.755 --> 01:48:25.475
Whaf about fhe Kid, Geoff?

01:48:25.515 --> 01:48:28.555
Broke his neck.
Took off a few minutes ago.

01:48:42.635 --> 01:48:44.555
- Deal me in.
- Get a seat.

01:48:48.035 --> 01:48:50.555
I took care of everything
out on the field.

01:48:50.635 --> 01:48:52.675
Thanks, fella.
Give me a drink.

01:49:01.075 --> 01:49:02.955
You send for me, Carter?

01:49:04.715 --> 01:49:08.915
Yes. The Kid asked me
to buy you a drink.

01:49:11.875 --> 01:49:13.235
Thanks.

01:49:14.075 --> 01:49:17.075
- Baldy, put it on the table.
- Wait a minute.

01:49:17.155 --> 01:49:20.355
- Why not have it with us?
- Sure. Why not? How about you, Judy?

01:49:20.395 --> 01:49:22.395
- Thanks.
- Come on, boys, set 'em up.

01:49:22.475 --> 01:49:23.875
Cigarette?

01:49:23.915 --> 01:49:25.955
How are the hands coming?

01:49:25.995 --> 01:49:27.395
Not bad.

01:49:30.395 --> 01:49:32.875
- Here you are, fella.
- Look out. You'll spill it.

01:49:32.955 --> 01:49:35.755
- Got it?
- Okay now?

01:49:35.795 --> 01:49:37.675
- Can you make it?
- I'll be all right.

01:49:39.315 --> 01:49:41.435
- Here you are, Judy.
- Thanks.

01:49:41.515 --> 01:49:43.955
- Come on, drink hearty.
- Here's how.

01:50:21.715 --> 01:50:24.155
Here's everything I could find.

01:50:27.275 --> 01:50:28.995
Help yourself.

01:50:29.075 --> 01:50:31.035
No, I don't want any.

01:50:40.315 --> 01:50:42.635
Not much to show for 22 years.

01:51:13.395 --> 01:51:15.715
So long, Sparks.

01:51:15.755 --> 01:51:17.315
Going, Bonnie?

01:51:17.395 --> 01:51:19.275
Nobody asked me to stay.

01:51:20.235 --> 01:51:22.755
Imagine, all the things happening to me
in the last few days...

01:51:22.795 --> 01:51:26.235
and I haven't got a picture
to show for it.

01:51:26.315 --> 01:51:28.355
Aren't you gonna say good-bye
to him?

01:51:30.115 --> 01:51:32.035
I think you ought to.

01:51:33.315 --> 01:51:34.675
You do?

01:51:35.635 --> 01:51:37.795
I think he'd want you to.

01:51:39.715 --> 01:51:41.555
Are you sure?

01:51:41.635 --> 01:51:45.195
He might not act like it,
but I think he would.

01:51:47.155 --> 01:51:49.675
Well, if you think I ought to.

01:51:49.755 --> 01:51:52.115
I think you should.

01:51:56.235 --> 01:51:59.355
I don't mind doing it
if you say so.

01:51:59.435 --> 01:52:01.475
- I do say so.
- You do?

01:52:02.995 --> 01:52:07.515
Well, I guess I'd better go ahead
and do it, then.

01:52:21.995 --> 01:52:23.395
Hello, Geoff.

01:52:23.435 --> 01:52:25.155
Hello, Bonnie.

01:52:25.195 --> 01:52:28.355
I just thought I wanted to...

01:52:28.395 --> 01:52:29.795
Well...

01:52:30.955 --> 01:52:34.315
Sparks thought that before I go,
I better...

01:52:35.995 --> 01:52:37.835
I don't know.

01:52:39.395 --> 01:52:42.275
That's all I wanted to say.
Just...

01:52:42.315 --> 01:52:45.475
He said you'd like it,
but I don't know. You never...

01:52:54.995 --> 01:52:56.875
Oh, Geoff, you're crying.

01:52:58.595 --> 01:52:59.955
Please, don't.

01:53:03.555 --> 01:53:05.475
I'll never be able to...

01:53:06.675 --> 01:53:08.675
Never be able to what, Bonnie?

01:53:08.715 --> 01:53:10.995
I'll never be able to say it
if you...

01:53:11.075 --> 01:53:12.435
Say what?

01:53:13.995 --> 01:53:16.355
I was going to say good-bye.

01:53:19.035 --> 01:53:23.555
Geoff, do you want me to stay
or don't you?

01:53:24.875 --> 01:53:26.795
- Well, Bonnie...
- Calling Barranca.

01:53:27.995 --> 01:53:30.195
Calling Barranca.
What's the matter down there?

01:53:30.275 --> 01:53:32.435
- Calling Barranca!
- Go ahead.

01:53:32.515 --> 01:53:35.915
Geoff, storm's breaking up.
Wind's dropping down to a whisper.

01:53:35.995 --> 01:53:38.195
Yeah? Wait a minute.
Hey, Sparks!

01:53:38.275 --> 01:53:40.355
Sparks! Get him, will you?

01:53:40.435 --> 01:53:43.315
- How's the pass?
- Clearing fast as a cat licking cream.

01:53:43.395 --> 01:53:45.955
- What do you want?
- Wind up #7. The pass is clearing.

01:53:46.035 --> 01:53:47.435
How 'bout it?

01:53:47.475 --> 01:53:49.835
Stand by. It won't be long now.

01:53:53.875 --> 01:53:55.435
Moon's breaking through.

01:53:55.515 --> 01:53:58.955
Here she comes.
She's shinin' harder than $700.

01:53:59.035 --> 01:54:00.395
Let 'em come!

01:54:00.475 --> 01:54:02.435
- We're coming. How 'bout it?
- You and me?

01:54:02.475 --> 01:54:05.115
- Why not?
- Let's get going.

01:54:05.195 --> 01:54:07.035
- What do you think of that?
- What is?

01:54:07.115 --> 01:54:09.875
The pass is clearing.
We've just got time to make it.

01:54:09.955 --> 01:54:12.075
- How are you going to fly?
- I've got one good arm.

01:54:12.155 --> 01:54:13.955
- And I've got another.
- I don't know...

01:54:13.995 --> 01:54:16.035
Cheer up, Dutchy.
Our contract's as good as in the bag.

01:54:16.995 --> 01:54:20.155
- Come on.
- So long. Keep that coffee warm.

01:54:20.235 --> 01:54:22.715
I won't be here.
I'm going on the boat.

01:54:22.795 --> 01:54:25.635
- Nobody asked me to stay.
- They haven't?

01:54:25.675 --> 01:54:28.155
No. And you wouldn't ask anybody
to do anything, would you?

01:54:28.235 --> 01:54:29.595
That's right.

01:54:29.675 --> 01:54:32.235
Here, we'll flip the coin for it.
Tails you go, heads you stay.

01:54:33.435 --> 01:54:36.235
- Heads. What about it?
- I won't stay that way.

01:54:36.275 --> 01:54:38.275
You won't?

01:54:38.355 --> 01:54:41.475
I'm hard to get, Geoff.
All you have to do is ask me.

01:54:42.795 --> 01:54:46.595
Here's a souvenir for you.
I like that saying good-bye.

01:54:46.635 --> 01:54:48.035
So long, Bonnie.

01:54:53.475 --> 01:54:55.315
Son of a gun.

01:55:06.715 --> 01:55:08.075
Hey, Geoff!
