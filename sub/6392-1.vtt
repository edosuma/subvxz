DIVORCE ITALIAN STYLE

00:28.758 --> 00:31.550
Directed by

02:34.800 --> 02:36.342
- Roast beef, sir?
- Yes.

02:36.425 --> 02:38.008
- Potatoes?
- Two.

02:39.508 --> 02:41.175
That's enough.

03:09.050 --> 03:11.217
<i>The serenades of the south.</i>

03:11.342 --> 03:14.675
<i>The sweet, warm, exhausting
Sicilian nights.</i>

03:14.758 --> 03:17.092
<i>The whole time I'd been away,</i>

03:17.217 --> 03:20.758
<i>the memory of those nights...
or rather, of one particular night...</i>

03:20.883 --> 03:25.092
<i>had filled my days with longing
and nostalgia.</i>

03:26.050 --> 03:28.217
<i>Agramonte: 18,000 souls,</i>

03:28.342 --> 03:29.967
<i>4,300 of them illiterate.</i>

03:30.092 --> 03:33.300
<i>1,700 either partially or fully
unemployed.</i>

03:33.425 --> 03:36.258
<i>Twenty-four churches,
if I'm not mistaken,</i>

03:36.383 --> 03:40.258
<i>including a few distinguished
Baroque specimens of the late 1600s.</i>

03:42.717 --> 03:44.633
<i>This is the Cefalù palace,</i>

03:44.758 --> 03:46.800
<i>and this is my ancestors'
coat of arms.</i>

03:46.925 --> 03:50.175
<i>Practically the only thing
my father had not yet sold.</i>

03:50.258 --> 03:51.758
<i>Papa's dissolute ways,</i>

03:51.842 --> 03:54.175
<i>whose nature I won't disclose
out of respect for Mama,</i>

03:54.258 --> 03:57.342
<i>had reduced us to living
in a single wing of the palace,</i>

03:57.425 --> 04:01.883
<i>while the other wing was occupied
by my Uncle Calogero and his family.</i>

04:02.050 --> 04:05.800
<i>But of this fateful cohabitation and
its consequences, I'll speak more later.</i>

04:06.842 --> 04:09.758
<i>Here's my father,
Baron Don Gaetano Cefalù.</i>

04:09.883 --> 04:11.675
<i>And these are his friends
from the social club.</i>

04:11.758 --> 04:14.592
- You're looking well, Baron.
- My respects, Don Gaetano.

04:14.717 --> 04:17.717
<i>For five seconds
he was the object of their gossip.</i>

04:17.842 --> 04:21.592
<i>But here they are, once again engrossed
in their favorite topic: Women.</i>

04:21.717 --> 04:23.675
<i>An inexhaustible subject.</i>

04:23.758 --> 04:26.008
<i>In the vivid imagination
of my townsmen,</i>

04:26.092 --> 04:28.383
<i>women took on mythical status.</i>

04:28.508 --> 04:30.175
<i>The marvelous, invisible women
of Agramonte,</i>

04:30.258 --> 04:33.050
<i>who hid their beauty and ardor
behind the grating...</i>

04:33.175 --> 04:36.092
<i>Pardon me... behind the slats
of bashful shutters.</i>

04:37.050 --> 04:38.842
<i>Meanwhile, Agramonte's working class</i>

04:38.925 --> 04:41.342
<i>marched inexorably on
toward progress.</i>

04:48.758 --> 04:52.133
<i>This progress may have been
a tad slow... indeed.</i>

04:52.258 --> 04:54.550
<i>But the audacious trumpets
of the working class</i>

04:54.633 --> 04:57.925
<i>were answered by
the equally loud bells of San Filmino.</i>

05:02.550 --> 05:05.717
Therefore, my faithful
and beloved fellow citizens,

05:05.883 --> 05:11.050
I exhort you to vote for a party
that is of the people

05:11.175 --> 05:13.883
and therefore democratic,

05:14.008 --> 05:16.550
and therefore respectful of our
Christian faith.

05:16.675 --> 05:19.092
A party, in a word,

05:19.175 --> 05:22.592
both democratic and Christian.

05:35.342 --> 05:37.133
<i>My wife, Rosalia.</i>

05:38.092 --> 05:40.383
<i>Twelve years of marriage.</i>

05:43.717 --> 05:45.675
<i>Donna Matilde, my mother.</i>

05:48.967 --> 05:51.592
<i>My sister Agnese,
unmarried and still dependent,</i>

05:51.717 --> 05:55.508
<i>officially compromised...
i.e., engaged... to Rosario Mulè,</i>

05:55.592 --> 05:58.592
<i>of the respected firm Mulè and Sons,</i>

05:58.675 --> 06:00.592
<i>a funeral parlor.</i>

06:05.342 --> 06:07.258
<i>And this is Don Calogero,</i>

06:07.342 --> 06:09.092
<i>intruder in the Cefalù Palace,</i>

06:09.217 --> 06:11.967
<i>husband of Aunt Fifidda,
my father's sister.</i>

06:12.092 --> 06:15.175
<i>In a mere 15 years, this former farmer</i>

06:15.175 --> 06:17.800
<i>had paid off a number
of my father's rash gambling debts,</i>

06:17.925 --> 06:21.342
<i>enabling him to snatch up
our best plots of land.</i>

06:22.883 --> 06:24.800
<i>And finally we come to Angela,</i>

06:25.592 --> 06:28.758
<i>daughter of Calogero and Fifidda
and thus my first cousin.</i>

06:28.883 --> 06:30.925
<i>Angela attended high...</i>

06:32.342 --> 06:36.758
<i>Attended a high school
run by nuns in Catania.</i>

06:36.883 --> 06:39.467
<i>She spent her summer vacations
at home.</i>

06:51.425 --> 06:53.217
<i>I loved Angela.</i>

06:55.508 --> 06:59.050
- Good night, Don Ferdinando.
- Regards to Donna Rosalia.

06:59.133 --> 07:00.842
- Good night.
- Rest well.

07:01.758 --> 07:03.050
Good night.

07:39.925 --> 07:40.925
<i>Fefè.</i>

07:41.925 --> 07:45.175
<i>- You feeling all right?
- I'm fine. Good night.</i>

08:28.592 --> 08:29.592
Fefè.

08:30.675 --> 08:31.633
Yes?

08:31.758 --> 08:34.425
<i>- What is it? Aren't you well?
- I'm fine.</i>

08:34.550 --> 08:36.050
What is it?

08:36.175 --> 08:38.717
Do you need anything? Some warm chamomile?

08:38.842 --> 08:42.133
I don't want anything. Go to bed.

08:42.633 --> 08:44.550
<i>Go to bed.</i>

09:16.508 --> 09:19.300
<i>- Who's in there?
- It's me, Papa.</i>

09:19.425 --> 09:22.050
Hurry up, please.

09:22.592 --> 09:23.800
All right.

09:27.050 --> 09:30.050
Gaetano, do you need me?

09:30.175 --> 09:33.050
No, go to bed.

09:33.175 --> 09:34.925
Get out of here!

09:43.675 --> 09:45.300
Sorry.

10:11.258 --> 10:14.550
I knew the garlic in the peppers
wouldn't agree with you.

10:15.425 --> 10:17.342
I told your mother so.

10:17.425 --> 10:20.800
She says you can't cook peppers
without garlic.

10:20.925 --> 10:24.217
It's true that they're not
as good without garlic.

10:25.175 --> 10:27.675
But she should understand,

10:27.758 --> 10:31.717
there are some things a wife understands
better than a mother.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.217
It's a matter of...

10:34.592 --> 10:36.217
I don't know.

10:36.592 --> 10:39.175
It's nothing I can spell out.

10:42.633 --> 10:44.217
Don't you agree, Fefè?

10:50.758 --> 10:54.758
I'm a little chilly.
It's so cold tonight.

10:54.883 --> 10:57.092
Rosalia, are you sick or something?

10:57.217 --> 11:00.092
The thermometer at the club read
90º today.

11:00.758 --> 11:03.883
Fefè, do you really love me?

11:03.967 --> 11:06.008
Of course I do.

11:07.008 --> 11:09.592
How much, Fefè, how much?

11:13.675 --> 11:17.133
Your feet are so nice and cool.

11:49.842 --> 11:53.050
<i>And yet... she had looked in
my direction.</i>

12:15.300 --> 12:17.175
You know what I was thinking?

12:17.258 --> 12:20.883
I was wondering,
why is it we're alive?

12:24.258 --> 12:27.842
Have you ever wondered
what the purpose of our lives is?

12:27.925 --> 12:30.467
- No. What is it?
- To love.

12:31.592 --> 12:34.342
To love. We live to love.

12:34.425 --> 12:37.717
- If we wasn't to love...
- "Weren't". If we weren't to love.

12:37.842 --> 12:43.258
Yes, we would wilter,
like so many wiltered flowers.

12:44.758 --> 12:46.967
I mean, wilt... that's the word.

12:47.258 --> 12:49.092
This abysmal heat!

12:54.175 --> 12:55.758
Do you need anything?

12:55.925 --> 12:57.508
No. Go to sleep.

13:07.258 --> 13:09.675
Baroness, tell him to keep
his hands to himself!

13:09.758 --> 13:12.258
You watch out,
or I'll tell your father.

13:12.342 --> 13:13.967
You know how he is.

13:14.092 --> 13:17.717
- What can I do?
- Be quiet! You're a tease.

13:17.842 --> 13:20.675
Last night I pushed my dresser up
against the door,

13:20.758 --> 13:23.467
but the minute I turned my back...

13:23.592 --> 13:26.675
Don Fefè, you tell him.
- So don't turn your back.

13:29.133 --> 13:30.758
Oh, my God, someone's coming!

13:34.592 --> 13:36.217
Don Ferdinando!

13:36.342 --> 13:38.008
Agnese, please.

13:38.842 --> 13:41.633
Don Ferdinando,
Agnese and I must get married.

13:41.758 --> 13:43.925
Soon. Before Christmas.

13:44.050 --> 13:47.467
Yes, we'll discuss it,
but there's still plenty of time.

13:47.592 --> 13:51.133
But first I have to finish
mourning my poor grandfather.

13:51.258 --> 13:55.383
Don't get any ideas.
Rosario has always respected me.

13:55.675 --> 13:57.300
I swear!

13:59.092 --> 14:02.717
Well, I'll be going.

14:03.508 --> 14:05.217
Excuse me.

14:12.758 --> 14:17.217
<i>Well, I guess I am a rather
interesting man...</i>

14:17.300 --> 14:20.383
<i>refined, intelligent.</i>

14:22.675 --> 14:25.383
<i>But that stomach!</i>

14:26.592 --> 14:31.092
<i>I'll have to cut out fats,
sugars and starches.</i>

14:31.217 --> 14:33.175
<i>I'll have to cut out everything!</i>

14:49.383 --> 14:52.633
I brought you your coffee,
freshly brewed.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.383
- Were you resting?
- Yes.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.383
Not so much. Just a bit.

15:10.467 --> 15:13.383
What do you mean? You like it sweet.

15:13.467 --> 15:14.925
Not anymore.

15:16.425 --> 15:20.717
Fefè, can I have a sip?
Just a tiny sip.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.425
- There's a potful right there.
- No, from your cup.

15:37.425 --> 15:39.467
- Are you crazy?
- A gray hair.

15:40.258 --> 15:43.133
Now that I've pulled one out,
seven more will grow in.

15:43.425 --> 15:47.217
Gray temples are so distinguished.
Did you know that?

15:55.258 --> 15:57.967
Sisina, watch the wind!

15:58.092 --> 15:59.592
The house is filling with smoke!

15:59.717 --> 16:01.550
How many times must I tell you, idiot!

16:01.633 --> 16:02.842
I can't help that.

16:05.508 --> 16:08.717
You have to talk to your mother,
for crying out loud!

16:08.800 --> 16:12.592
We made soap on the 18th of last month,
and it's only the 11th!

16:12.758 --> 16:14.675
Do you know what we spend
in a month just on soap?

16:14.758 --> 16:17.342
Please, don't start this again.

16:17.467 --> 16:18.550
What?

16:18.675 --> 16:21.800
Can't you buy ready-made soap
at the store?

16:22.758 --> 16:27.383
If we used our heads more,
we could save some real money.

16:27.508 --> 16:31.133
Believe me, your mother's
going to hear about this!

16:47.050 --> 16:50.008
<i>Couldn't you find some other
time to make soap?</i>

16:50.092 --> 16:52.550
- We have to make it.
- The house is filling with smoke!

16:52.633 --> 16:54.758
We're suffocating!

16:54.883 --> 16:57.300
<i>Good girl, Sisina.</i>

18:15.758 --> 18:20.092
<i>Sometimes we'd go to the beach
in the summer.</i>

18:21.092 --> 18:25.300
<i>Rosalia would bury herself
in the sand for her arthritis.</i>

18:39.092 --> 18:40.967
Would you move my umbrella?

19:25.467 --> 19:27.425
<i>Oh, my God, someone's coming!</i>

19:29.050 --> 19:32.383
- Warm day.
- Yes, quite.

19:32.758 --> 19:35.633
We weren't doing anything wrong.
I swear.

19:35.800 --> 19:36.883
I know.

19:37.092 --> 19:40.592
Baron, we never had that talk.
I'm ready when you are.

19:40.758 --> 19:43.425
- Christmas is still a ways off.
- Right, well...

19:43.550 --> 19:45.133
Excuse us.

19:57.925 --> 20:00.342
<i>Angela!</i>

20:27.425 --> 20:29.925
Angela, what are you doing?

20:30.883 --> 20:35.008
Picking flowers in honor
of the Immaculate Conception.

20:35.092 --> 20:37.717
I felt like picking flowers too.

20:39.258 --> 20:42.883
I just wouldn't know who to give
them to.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.800
You know what I mean, don't you?

20:52.258 --> 20:53.800
Yes.

21:00.925 --> 21:02.592
They smell so nice!

21:05.092 --> 21:07.342
The other day as you were leaving church,

21:08.342 --> 21:10.342
you looked at me.

21:10.425 --> 21:12.425
Why did you look at me that way?

21:14.383 --> 21:17.758
So you've thought about it, eh?

21:25.717 --> 21:28.008
- Wait.
- Here.

21:40.092 --> 21:43.092
There he is. My beloved son
was off picking flowers.

21:43.217 --> 21:45.758
Got some real flowers too
while he was at it.

21:45.925 --> 21:47.883
Papa, you know how to ruin
a poetic moment.

21:48.008 --> 21:50.008
Rosalia is right.

21:53.717 --> 21:56.633
Fefè, what lovely flowers.

21:59.550 --> 22:02.050
Thank you, my son.

22:06.092 --> 22:08.633
- How nice. Where'd you find them?
- Over there.

22:45.258 --> 22:47.675
Bring them closer so I can smell them.

22:50.925 --> 22:52.550
So pretty.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.258
MAN ORBITS EARTH

23:29.092 --> 23:32.883
Fefè, I feel a strange dissatisfaction
deep inside.

23:33.008 --> 23:35.258
For instance, you know
how much I like grapes.

23:35.383 --> 23:38.592
Well, I like grapes most
when we have none.

23:38.717 --> 23:42.175
When we have grapes,
I feel like eating pears.

23:43.133 --> 23:47.050
<i>Last year in Agramonte, the homicide
rate was 2. 1%. That's something.</i>

23:47.133 --> 23:50.717
At your service, Baron. Baroness.

23:52.758 --> 23:56.508
- Anyway, where was I?
- You look like a princess!

23:58.425 --> 24:02.092
<i>Don Ciccio Matara,
Natalino Urso's henchman,</i>

24:02.258 --> 24:04.550
<i>the man who torched
the Mazzalorso family's land.</i>

24:04.675 --> 24:07.383
<i>Horrible things were said
about Don Ciccio.</i>

24:07.508 --> 24:09.717
<i>Two years ago they killed
that woman Cesira,</i>

24:09.842 --> 24:11.467
<i>right here on her way to church.</i>

24:11.592 --> 24:13.050
<i>And no one saw a thing.</i>

24:20.342 --> 24:23.050
<i>But to be beholden forever
to Don Ciccio Matara...</i>

24:23.175 --> 24:25.300
<i>no, no, no.</i>

24:25.425 --> 24:27.133
See you tonight, then.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.175
- Where was I, Fefè?
- Pears.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.883
Right. For me it's not
the grapes in themselves,

24:35.008 --> 24:36.925
as much as my desire for them.

24:37.008 --> 24:38.967
Like that poem I like so much,

24:39.092 --> 24:42.883
that says Saturdays are so much
better than Sundays.

24:42.967 --> 24:44.883
Hello again.

24:54.050 --> 24:56.550
<i>I'll kill her!</i>

25:00.883 --> 25:03.092
- Gaetano!
- Shut up!

25:07.258 --> 25:08.550
<i>I don't deserve this!</i>

25:08.717 --> 25:10.467
<i>I didn't know it yet.</i>

25:10.592 --> 25:13.800
<i>But that night would mark
a turning point in my life.</i>

25:15.175 --> 25:16.967
I'll kick him out of this house!

25:17.092 --> 25:18.883
Stop your father!

25:18.967 --> 25:20.133
Papa, what is it?

25:20.258 --> 25:25.092
He had the nerve to wave two
25,000-lire notes in my face!

25:25.217 --> 25:28.300
Aunt Fifidda was calling for help.
What do notes have to do with it?

25:28.425 --> 25:31.092
I don't know. I think
he's beating his daughter.

25:32.925 --> 25:36.133
Come here, you hussy!

25:36.925 --> 25:39.425
Fifidda, open up! It's me!

25:39.592 --> 25:40.842
What's the scoundrel's name?

25:40.967 --> 25:44.133
- He'll kill the poor child!
- Let me in!

25:44.258 --> 25:45.633
His name!

25:46.217 --> 25:48.383
I'll never tell you!

25:48.467 --> 25:51.258
Tell me the name of that scoundrel!

25:51.592 --> 25:54.467
Stop it! Calm down!

25:56.300 --> 25:58.592
Cover yourself up, you hussy!

26:11.425 --> 26:13.258
Come on, let's go.

26:15.425 --> 26:17.467
The hussy!

26:19.383 --> 26:21.092
Excuse me.

26:29.842 --> 26:32.592
No, not her!

26:33.258 --> 26:34.925
What's the midwife doing here?

26:35.050 --> 26:36.925
- I want to know her condition.
- Why?

26:37.050 --> 26:38.258
She has a lover.

26:38.383 --> 26:42.050
Yes. Her diary's right here.

26:42.383 --> 26:45.217
Read for yourself.

26:45.592 --> 26:48.050
I'll kill her with my own hands!

26:49.092 --> 26:53.133
<i>Today it finally happened.
Surrounded by all those flowers...</i>

26:53.258 --> 26:56.550
- Fefè, what happened?
- Nothing. They're all in the next room.

26:56.633 --> 26:58.592
I'll go take a look.

27:04.925 --> 27:09.550
<i>Today it finally happened.
Surrounded by all those flowers...</i>

27:11.133 --> 27:13.092
<i>we met, and...</i>

27:14.133 --> 27:17.008
<i>But it's too marvelous for words.</i>

27:17.258 --> 27:20.467
<i>Now I'm his forever!</i>

27:27.758 --> 27:29.633
<i>My sweet love...</i>

27:30.508 --> 27:35.300
<i>beaten, humiliated, examined.</i>

27:36.092 --> 27:40.300
<i>The smile on that witch's face
when she said to your father,</i>

27:41.258 --> 27:43.008
<i>"Undefiled".</i>

27:44.758 --> 27:46.675
<i>Undefiled.</i>

27:48.592 --> 27:50.258
<i>My poor Angela.</i>

27:50.758 --> 27:52.008
<i>You're a flower.</i>

27:52.800 --> 27:55.050
<i>A delicate lily.</i>

30:09.217 --> 30:10.758
Why are you crying?

30:13.092 --> 30:14.717
Why?

30:15.925 --> 30:17.592
Aren't you cold?

30:20.717 --> 30:22.967
Look what he did to me.

30:25.217 --> 30:28.467
But I didn't say a word about us.

30:28.592 --> 30:30.175
My love.

30:30.258 --> 30:32.342
I'm leaving. I'm going away.

30:32.925 --> 30:35.383
They're sending me back to school.

30:37.425 --> 30:39.925
No, we mustn't.

30:45.592 --> 30:48.675
Angela, you're mine!

31:19.300 --> 31:21.883
<i>She left the next day
on the 10:20 bus,</i>

31:22.758 --> 31:26.300
<i>accompanied by two nuns from
the Convent of the Seven Sorrows.</i>

31:30.592 --> 31:33.425
Good-bye, my love.

31:50.133 --> 31:52.425
<i>That same week, in Catania,</i>

31:52.550 --> 31:54.508
<i>the trial of Mariannina Terranova
was starting,</i>

31:54.592 --> 31:57.800
<i>who had committed a crime of passion.</i>

31:57.925 --> 32:01.383
<i>I'm sure you remember
the hullabaloo in the press.</i>

32:01.925 --> 32:05.592
<i>The two-timing victim,
Vito Cafiero, a 24-year-old student.</i>

32:05.717 --> 32:08.758
<i>The pathetic figure of the killer,
Mariannina Terranova,</i>

32:08.883 --> 32:10.758
<i>his 26-year-old common-law wife.</i>

32:10.883 --> 32:13.050
<i>Mariannina had taken a train</i>

32:13.133 --> 32:16.092
<i>and gone to empty her gun
into the body of her beloved</i>

32:16.175 --> 32:18.300
<i>as he left a movie theater
in Catania.</i>

32:18.425 --> 32:22.175
<i>The collective honor of the south
had found its heroine.</i>

32:30.092 --> 32:34.800
Mariannina Terranova,
where did you get the murder weapon?

32:36.092 --> 32:38.633
- He gave it to me.
- Who's "he"?

32:39.300 --> 32:44.008
Him. He said: "If I ever cheat on you,
kill me with this".

32:44.092 --> 32:45.258
And then?

32:45.967 --> 32:47.008
And then?

32:49.425 --> 32:52.217
And then... he destroyed my honor.

32:52.342 --> 32:55.008
Good for you, Mariannina!

32:55.133 --> 32:57.508
Remove that woman!

33:03.133 --> 33:04.717
Gentlemen of the jury.

33:09.967 --> 33:13.008
"Lips once kissed long for more".

33:13.717 --> 33:17.508
But I say, paraphrasing
a much more lofty and sacred text,

33:18.300 --> 33:21.008
"He who looks at a woman with desire

33:21.092 --> 33:23.758
has already sinned in his heart".

33:24.092 --> 33:29.467
So while the train carried Mariannina
Terranova to her fateful destination,

33:29.592 --> 33:35.008
unstoppable as the destiny
that drove her on.

33:35.133 --> 33:37.550
This poor, diminutive creature
of the south.

33:37.633 --> 33:39.883
Wrapped in the age-old dark shawl,

33:39.967 --> 33:42.133
symbol of our women's modesty,

33:42.258 --> 33:44.592
wringing her hands in her lap,

33:44.717 --> 33:47.383
her womb condemned by God

33:47.508 --> 33:51.175
to suffer the divine pangs
of motherhood,

33:51.258 --> 33:55.550
while the train raced on
as in an inescapable nightmare,

33:55.633 --> 33:59.383
the rhythmic thrust
of the pistons pounding

33:59.467 --> 34:02.758
in the delirious ears
of poor, ruined Mariannina...

34:02.883 --> 34:04.967
"Dishonored, dishonored, dishonored".

34:14.342 --> 34:18.050
<i>Honor, my friends. What is honor?</i>

34:18.717 --> 34:22.050
<i>Shall we accept the definition
given by the venerable Tomaseo</i>

34:22.133 --> 34:24.508
<i>in his monumental dictionary
of the Italian language:</i>

34:24.592 --> 34:30.425
<i>"The moral and civic attributes
that render a man respectable</i>

34:30.550 --> 34:33.758
<i>and respected in the society
in which he lives"?</i>

34:33.925 --> 34:38.467
<i>Or shall we throw that out
like some worn-out, useless thing?</i>

34:39.592 --> 34:43.342
<i>Letters! Letters written by anonymous
but symbolic hands.</i>

34:43.425 --> 34:47.008
Illegible letters that would offend
the dignity of this courtroom.

34:47.092 --> 34:49.883
<i>Blunt and concise, like this one,</i>

34:50.008 --> 34:52.758
<i>which in one word renders poor
Mariannina's fate:</i>

34:52.883 --> 34:54.467
"Cuckoldess"!

34:54.592 --> 35:00.383
<i>Or this one, which uses a crude image
to express the nefarious thought.</i>

35:01.425 --> 35:05.342
<i>Cuckold! Dishonored!</i>

35:05.467 --> 35:11.217
<i>The Cefalù family name,
my lineage, sullied by a tramp!</i>

35:13.758 --> 35:15.258
Tramp.

35:18.133 --> 35:21.592
<i>Let's take a look.</i>

35:32.342 --> 35:33.633
<i>Here we are.</i>

35:34.092 --> 35:37.175
<i>Article 587 of the Penal Code:</i>

35:37.258 --> 35:40.050
<i>"He who causes the death
of spouse, daughter or sister</i>

35:40.217 --> 35:43.133
<i>upon discovering her
in illegitimate carnal relations</i>

35:43.258 --> 35:47.175
<i>and in the heat of passion
caused by the offense to his honor</i>

35:47.258 --> 35:49.925
<i>or that of his family will be sentenced
to three to seven years".</i>

35:50.258 --> 35:52.467
<i>Three to seven years. Let's see.</i>

35:52.758 --> 35:55.550
<i>I'm 37 years old.
Seven more makes 44.</i>

35:55.633 --> 35:58.508
<i>Angela is 16, plus seven...</i>

36:01.008 --> 36:02.592
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

36:02.800 --> 36:04.675
<i>Seven years is the maximum.</i>

36:04.758 --> 36:07.842
<i>Terranova... No, her crime
can't be considered the same.</i>

36:07.883 --> 36:11.758
<i>The law is clear. It considers
the jealousy of the woman,</i>

36:11.925 --> 36:13.717
<i>but it doesn't protect her honor.</i>

36:14.425 --> 36:16.842
EIGHT YEARS FOR MARIANNINA
MORAL INSULT MITIGATES SENTENCE

36:16.925 --> 36:18.925
FOR NATIVE OF AGRAMONTE
WHO WAS SEDUCED AND ABANDONED

36:20.092 --> 36:21.758
<i>Eight years.</i>

36:21.967 --> 36:24.258
<i>That's certainly
quite a stretch of time,</i>

36:24.383 --> 36:26.050
<i>but she's a bricklayer's daughter.</i>

36:26.175 --> 36:28.967
<i>She's vulgar, ignorant, ugly.
A common-law wife!</i>

36:29.425 --> 36:32.925
<i>Whereas I'm a gentleman,
with a college degree,</i>

36:33.050 --> 36:35.383
<i>an exemplary husband
of almost 15 years.</i>

36:35.592 --> 36:37.050
<i>An aristocrat!</i>

36:37.133 --> 36:39.675
<i>Yes, gentlemen of the jury,
an aristocrat.</i>

36:39.758 --> 36:44.592
<i>These are dark times, full of greed
and cynical scientific materialism.</i>

36:44.717 --> 36:48.675
<i>But aristocrats are not
aristocrats for nothing. No, sir!</i>

36:48.758 --> 36:52.800
<i>But I'm certainly not going
to hark back to the Crusades.</i>

36:52.925 --> 36:55.633
<i>No, let's stick to the facts.</i>

36:57.758 --> 36:59.758
<i>Gentlemen of the jury,</i>

36:59.883 --> 37:02.342
<i>is there anything
in the letter of the law</i>

37:02.425 --> 37:05.800
<i>that does not perfectly fit
this man's tragic situation?</i>

37:05.925 --> 37:09.217
<i>Was there not the heat of passion?
Was his honor not offended</i>

37:09.300 --> 37:11.550
<i>the instant he discovered
his beloved spouse</i>

37:11.675 --> 37:14.592
<i>swooning in her lover's arms?</i>

37:15.258 --> 37:19.342
<i>A lover for Rosalia... who could it be?</i>

37:19.467 --> 37:22.050
<i>He'd have to be hand-picked.</i>

37:22.592 --> 37:25.883
<i>Someone I could bring
into the house. Into her bed.</i>

37:25.967 --> 37:29.800
<i>But who could it be?</i>

37:34.883 --> 37:36.717
<i>I bought her that dress in Catania,</i>

37:36.842 --> 37:39.800
<i>and took her for a stroll
for a specific reason.</i>

37:39.925 --> 37:41.842
- Baroness.
- Professor.

37:41.925 --> 37:44.842
<i>- My respects.
- No, the professor won't work.</i>

37:45.092 --> 37:48.967
- Fefè, everyone's looking at me.
- No, they're not.

37:49.092 --> 37:50.925
<i>I wanted to see if those
well-rounded hips,</i>

37:51.050 --> 37:53.383
<i>that had clinched my proposal
of marriage...</i>

37:53.717 --> 37:55.592
<i>I was young and inexperienced then.</i>

37:55.717 --> 38:00.383
<i>Anyway, I wanted to see if Rosalia's hips
still attracted men's attention,</i>

38:00.508 --> 38:04.425
<i>and in effect,
it seemed they did indeed.</i>

38:06.717 --> 38:08.967
You must be warm.

38:29.092 --> 38:32.092
<i>No, not the marshal.
Certainly no one related to the law.</i>

38:46.300 --> 38:48.467
<i>Absolutely not Don Ciccio Matara.</i>

38:49.717 --> 38:52.175
I can feel a draft.

39:14.675 --> 39:16.258
<i>Perhaps an artistic type,</i>

39:17.050 --> 39:18.550
<i>a soul mate.</i>

39:20.550 --> 39:24.383
<i>I wonder if Tonino Gambacurta
would be suitable.</i>

39:48.717 --> 39:51.800
What a lovely voice Tonino has.

39:51.925 --> 39:53.008
What?

39:55.300 --> 39:56.592
Poor boy.

39:59.550 --> 40:01.425
Why "poor boy"?

40:01.925 --> 40:03.842
Don't you know?

40:23.675 --> 40:27.300
<i>Definitely not Tonino.</i>

40:41.342 --> 40:42.675
Good night.

41:05.092 --> 41:09.258
If you don't say it,
I can't go to sleep.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.883
Yes, I love you. Good night.

41:12.175 --> 41:14.758
How much, Fefè?

41:26.300 --> 41:27.925
Why?

41:30.508 --> 41:31.675
Enough!

42:46.883 --> 42:48.008
<i>Ferdinando.</i>

42:48.092 --> 42:50.008
Mama's brought you some breakfast.

42:51.133 --> 42:53.258
- Do it for me.
- Go away!

42:56.925 --> 42:59.925
- Be patient.
- I always have to suffer.

43:00.050 --> 43:04.175
One day he's all sugar and honey,
and then all of a sudden...

43:05.925 --> 43:09.925
Rosalia, keep one thing in mind:
He loves you.

43:10.050 --> 43:11.883
That much is certain.

43:21.258 --> 43:23.717
What are you yelling about?
Go away!

43:25.342 --> 43:26.967
Animal.

43:30.383 --> 43:32.467
What are you looking at?
I'm talking to you.

43:32.592 --> 43:33.633
Idiot!

43:52.842 --> 43:54.467
Carmelino.

46:18.092 --> 46:21.842
<i>I saw you yesterday, Rosalia,
during the procession.</i>

46:22.133 --> 46:24.425
<i>You were as beautiful
and pure as the Virgin Mary.</i>

46:30.342 --> 46:32.217
<i>I wanted to die on the spot.</i>

46:32.300 --> 46:36.008
<i>To die with that image
of you in my soul,</i>

46:36.092 --> 46:38.217
<i>with this immense desire
to know you were mine,</i>

46:38.342 --> 46:41.425
<i>which life will never grant me.</i>

46:43.883 --> 46:47.217
<i>Believe me, Rosalia.
I'm afraid I'll lose my faith.</i>

46:47.383 --> 46:48.883
<i>No, I'm not blaspheming.</i>

46:49.050 --> 46:51.633
<i>But yesterday, when I saw you,
so beautiful and bold...</i>

46:51.758 --> 46:54.258
<i>Like a young pagan goddess...</i>

47:07.092 --> 47:12.175
<i>Desert of El Alamein,
Saturday, May 29, 1942,</i>

47:12.258 --> 47:14.967
<i>20th year of the fascist era.</i>

47:15.258 --> 47:19.342
<i>Rosalia, I swear if I make it out
of this hell alive,</i>

47:19.467 --> 47:23.883
<i>if this rotten war spares me
and I make it back,</i>

47:24.092 --> 47:26.008
<i>you'll be mine forever.</i>

47:27.383 --> 47:31.467
<i>Carmelo Patanè. Of course!
Declared missing in Africa.</i>

47:31.633 --> 47:35.383
<i>He was even listed on the monument
to the fallen in the piazza,</i>

47:35.467 --> 47:37.508
<i>but his name was later removed.</i>

47:37.592 --> 47:40.425
<i>Carmelo Patanè, godson of the old priest.</i>

47:41.133 --> 47:42.675
<i>Tramp!</i>

48:18.967 --> 48:20.717
Good morning.

48:21.008 --> 48:23.842
- The service is over.
- But I just saw someone go in.

48:23.925 --> 48:29.342
A painter restoring some works of art.
But if it's urgent, I suppose...

48:29.633 --> 48:31.425
Just a few minutes. A quick visit.

48:31.633 --> 48:33.092
Go ahead.

48:55.758 --> 48:58.383
That section was completely ruined.

49:03.383 --> 49:05.550
Look, Don Ferdinando.
That rosette merits restoring.

49:10.258 --> 49:11.967
And look over there.

49:17.425 --> 49:19.800
- He's quite good.
- Yes, he's very good.

49:28.175 --> 49:31.633
<i>By flattering Patanè's silly vanity,</i>

49:31.758 --> 49:33.717
<i>it was easy to lure him to my house</i>

49:33.842 --> 49:35.925
<i>on the pretext of requesting
his expert advice</i>

49:36.092 --> 49:39.425
<i>on some crusty old frescoes
on the living room ceiling.</i>

49:43.008 --> 49:45.633
Just as I suspected.

49:46.342 --> 49:50.508
Some ignorant 19th-century iconoclast,
with a view to...

49:50.592 --> 49:53.717
How can I say... improving his abode,

49:53.842 --> 49:59.758
had someone paint over
the original 17th-century decorations

49:59.883 --> 50:03.092
with these... if you'll forgive me...

50:03.258 --> 50:09.675
These absurd and quite revolting
scenes of hunting and feasting.

50:10.550 --> 50:12.300
Yes, that makes sense.

50:12.425 --> 50:16.175
They say the Cefalùs were
avid hunters, avid eaters,

50:16.258 --> 50:18.425
and avid... well, just avid.

50:19.008 --> 50:23.258
With all due respect, Baron, it was
sacrilegious on your ancestors' part.

50:23.383 --> 50:25.550
- I hope it can be fixed.
- Perhaps.

50:25.633 --> 50:27.758
You've gone mad, Fefè. It's all junk!

50:27.883 --> 50:31.050
No. Actually, I had in mind...

50:31.133 --> 50:35.175
I mean, if he thinks it's worth it.
- Well, it's a matter of...

50:43.758 --> 50:45.467
Pardon me.

50:50.425 --> 50:54.967
As I was saying.
They would be of great value,

50:55.092 --> 50:56.717
if properly restored.

50:57.842 --> 50:59.425
<i>Idiot!</i>

51:00.092 --> 51:03.550
<i>But they had pretended
not to know each other.</i>

51:04.592 --> 51:07.592
<i>Perhaps the time had come
for me to make up with Rosalia.</i>

51:30.092 --> 51:31.717
<i>Come in.</i>

51:37.133 --> 51:40.300
Rosalia, it's me. I'm sorry.

52:20.425 --> 52:23.133
Forgive me. Be patient with me.

52:42.967 --> 52:46.592
You really must excuse me.
I have a terrible headache.

52:46.717 --> 52:50.092
Oh, I'm sorry. Just a kiss, then.

52:51.258 --> 52:53.050
Good night.

52:54.467 --> 52:56.467
<i>Carmelo is fine.</i>

52:56.800 --> 52:58.758
<i>Perfect.</i>

53:07.675 --> 53:12.133
<i>The next day, on the pretext
of taking care of some old taxes,</i>

53:12.258 --> 53:14.092
<i>I went to Catania.</i>

53:14.217 --> 53:17.300
<i>I was dying to see Angela.</i>

53:17.425 --> 53:18.925
<i>I also had to make a very
important purchase.</i>

53:19.050 --> 53:21.175
Let's try recording something.

53:21.258 --> 53:23.550
- Say something.
- I don't know what to say.

53:23.675 --> 53:26.008
The first thing that comes to mind.

53:26.133 --> 53:27.883
Go ahead!

53:28.092 --> 53:32.217
- Your Honor, gentlemen of the jury.
- You're not a lawyer, are you?

53:32.342 --> 53:35.675
Now listen to this gem. It's perfect.

53:35.967 --> 53:37.342
Just listen.

53:45.217 --> 53:46.717
Perfect, isn't it?

54:02.883 --> 54:03.842
Waiter.

54:06.050 --> 54:08.633
Take a nice bottle of wine
to the attorney.

54:10.467 --> 54:14.050
<i>Fate seemed to lay one favorable sign
after another at my feet.</i>

54:14.175 --> 54:18.050
<i>"Your Honor, gentlemen of the jury".</i>

54:30.258 --> 54:31.717
Thank you, my friend!

54:36.925 --> 54:38.258
<i>What a nice man.</i>

54:38.842 --> 54:40.717
<i>What a great face.</i>

54:40.800 --> 54:42.883
<i>So handsome.</i>

54:56.050 --> 54:58.217
Good day, my dear friend!

55:11.800 --> 55:13.050
Sister.

55:16.092 --> 55:18.675
Angela, what an unexpected pleasure.

55:20.758 --> 55:23.383
How are you? You've grown.

55:23.467 --> 55:25.217
A terrible thing has happened.

55:25.300 --> 55:27.675
Papa was here yesterday.
I wrote you a letter.

55:27.758 --> 55:29.883
Good morning, Sister.

55:30.008 --> 55:32.925
- Mother, this is my uncle.
- I'm her mother's brother. May I...

55:33.050 --> 55:35.217
I'm sorry, but not in public.

55:35.300 --> 55:37.758
Come to the institute
Sundays or Thursdays.

55:37.883 --> 55:39.175
Let's go.

55:39.300 --> 55:41.717
In line, girls. Move!

55:41.800 --> 55:43.800
Is she studying hard?

55:56.425 --> 55:59.383
Sisina? Is there any mail?

56:04.925 --> 56:06.592
Mama! Rosalia!

56:10.967 --> 56:12.592
Where is everybody?

56:15.800 --> 56:17.217
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

56:18.508 --> 56:20.092
Don Ferdinando, despite how it looks...

56:20.258 --> 56:22.633
- Is nobody home today?
- They're all at Aunt Fifidda's.

56:22.758 --> 56:24.717
- They've been fighting all day.
- Why?

56:26.800 --> 56:30.675
<i>She's my sister, you understand?
Keep your hands off her!</i>

56:30.758 --> 56:32.675
She's my wife too. And she's killing me!

56:32.758 --> 56:34.383
I'll do as I please in my house.

56:34.508 --> 56:37.467
It'll be yours when you pay for it.
Scoundrel!

56:41.425 --> 56:44.508
As long as I'm here it's mine.
And I'll do as I like.

56:44.592 --> 56:46.175
I'll take care of my own affairs.

56:46.300 --> 56:49.217
I decide about my daughter's life!

56:49.342 --> 56:53.258
You're a greedy scoundrel!
You want to marry her off for money!

56:53.383 --> 56:55.633
His own daughter! Disgusting!

56:55.758 --> 56:57.842
- Coward!
- Money grabber!

56:57.967 --> 56:59.800
You're just a coward!

57:14.508 --> 57:18.133
<i>But I'll be yours or no one's.</i>

57:19.008 --> 57:21.175
<i>Ferdinando, my beloved.</i>

57:22.758 --> 57:28.133
<i>If our love cannot be,
no other will ever take its place.</i>

57:30.383 --> 57:34.300
<i>In my heart I'll always be yours.</i>

57:35.092 --> 57:37.342
<i>I'll pray for you as long as I live.</i>

59:41.258 --> 59:44.175
<i>Who, gentlemen of the jury,</i>

59:44.467 --> 59:46.508
<i>in this rapid summary of the facts,</i>

59:46.633 --> 59:50.883
<i>could even vaguely imagine
the horror caused</i>

59:50.967 --> 59:54.925
<i>by the spectacle of the two
lovers lying there,</i>

59:55.050 --> 59:59.217
<i>disgustingly entwined in the
vile enactment of their sin.</i>

59:59.300 --> 1:00:02.592
<i>There, on the couch,
in his very own house!</i>

1:00:03.425 --> 1:00:08.300
<i>He was shocked.
He searched for an explanation.</i>

1:00:08.383 --> 1:00:13.508
<i>Perhaps he hoped for a miracle
to erase the sight from his eyes!</i>

1:00:13.592 --> 1:00:16.050
<i>Or perhaps he searched for words...</i>

1:00:16.217 --> 1:00:20.092
<i>Words that could express his pain.</i>

1:00:21.342 --> 1:00:23.758
<i>Instead, he found a weapon.</i>

1:00:23.883 --> 1:00:29.092
<i>An old pistol, forgotten for who knows
how long in some side table...</i>

1:00:36.925 --> 1:00:39.008
<i>Instead, he found a weapon.</i>

1:00:39.175 --> 1:00:42.800
<i>An old pistol,
forgotten for who knows how long</i>

1:00:42.925 --> 1:00:45.217
<i>in an old rococo credenza</i>

1:00:45.300 --> 1:00:49.217
<i>of 18th-century Neapolitan design,
perhaps rebuilt in the 19th.</i>

1:01:02.008 --> 1:01:06.925
<i>Carmelo Patanè began work
at 10:00 a.m. on July 12.</i>

1:01:07.258 --> 1:01:10.092
<i>It felt almost like a solemn ceremony,</i>

1:01:10.217 --> 1:01:12.550
<i>with her, him and me,</i>

1:01:12.717 --> 1:01:14.717
<i>all of us very excited but restrained.</i>

1:01:14.883 --> 1:01:17.050
<i>And Sisina was there, too.</i>

1:01:26.592 --> 1:01:30.592
Well, I guess I'll put on my smock.

1:01:30.717 --> 1:01:33.217
Will you excuse me?

1:01:33.550 --> 1:01:36.883
Yes, but first drink your coffee.
Please sit down.

1:01:37.092 --> 1:01:38.383
Thank you. With pleasure.

1:01:41.300 --> 1:01:42.717
- Sugar?
- Thank you.

1:01:42.842 --> 1:01:44.842
- One or two?
- Two.

1:01:47.717 --> 1:01:50.258
- Would you like a pastry?
- No, thank you.

1:01:50.425 --> 1:01:53.175
They're homemade. Very special.
My wife made them.

1:01:53.717 --> 1:01:55.842
In that case, I'd love one.

1:01:55.967 --> 1:01:57.092
Sisina, go on.

1:01:58.425 --> 1:02:00.008
Get going.

1:02:32.717 --> 1:02:34.217
Well, I'll excuse myself.

1:02:34.550 --> 1:02:36.675
Please finish your coffee.

1:02:36.758 --> 1:02:39.217
Besides, you haven't had your pastry.
Excuse me.

1:03:42.383 --> 1:03:45.592
You're looking well, Rosalia.

1:03:47.258 --> 1:03:49.175
So are you, Carmelo.

1:03:57.342 --> 1:03:59.842
<i>It's been so long.</i>

1:03:59.925 --> 1:04:02.842
<i>Yes, it has.</i>

1:04:03.842 --> 1:04:05.467
BARON CEFALÙ, OPEN YOUR EYES!

1:04:05.592 --> 1:04:08.133
YOUR WIFE IS CHEATING ON YOU
UNDER YOUR VERY OWN ROOF!

1:04:08.342 --> 1:04:09.467
A FRIEND.

1:04:35.258 --> 1:04:38.592
<i>Premature, I know.
But I was hoping for the best.</i>

1:04:44.092 --> 1:04:46.675
<i>Patanè was a very shy man.</i>

1:04:46.883 --> 1:04:49.717
<i>And Rosalia was disgustingly faithful.</i>

1:04:49.800 --> 1:04:52.300
<i>In three meetings,
nothing at all had happened.</i>

1:04:52.592 --> 1:04:54.467
<i>Or practically nothing.</i>

1:05:14.842 --> 1:05:18.592
<i>You know, I'd like to...
Perhaps I'm being foolish.</i>

1:05:18.717 --> 1:05:22.883
<i>Perhaps I could... I don't know...
help you a little.</i>

1:05:22.967 --> 1:05:25.300
<i>You could help me a lot, Rosalia.</i>

1:05:25.425 --> 1:05:28.008
<i>But please understand:</i>

1:05:28.092 --> 1:05:29.675
<i>Just as friends.</i>

1:05:29.967 --> 1:05:33.883
<i>I'd like to sit here and watch
while you work.</i>

1:05:34.592 --> 1:05:36.675
<i>Why that sad look now?</i>

1:05:36.800 --> 1:05:38.258
<i>It's nothing.</i>

1:05:44.467 --> 1:05:45.967
<i>Yes, Rosalia.</i>

1:05:46.092 --> 1:05:51.550
<i>The tempera mixture
with the water color and the oil-</i>

1:05:57.258 --> 1:05:58.508
<i>Why are you laughing?</i>

1:05:58.717 --> 1:06:01.675
<i>Please, don't laugh.
You're driving me mad.</i>

1:06:02.800 --> 1:06:04.133
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1:06:04.592 --> 1:06:06.383
<i>Won't you forgive me?</i>

1:06:06.467 --> 1:06:08.717
<i>I'd better not come here anymore.</i>

1:06:09.008 --> 1:06:10.467
<i>Believe me, it's better.</i>

1:06:44.050 --> 1:06:46.092
Sisina, take this plate away.

1:06:51.050 --> 1:06:54.342
<i>Nothing concrete happened
that day either.</i>

1:06:55.050 --> 1:06:57.050
<i>But Rosalia had changed.</i>

1:06:57.383 --> 1:07:00.217
<i>She was especially kind to me,</i>

1:07:00.467 --> 1:07:03.425
<i>almost as if already asking</i>

1:07:03.675 --> 1:07:05.092
<i>forgiveness for something.</i>

1:07:09.342 --> 1:07:11.758
Rosalia, the head.

1:07:12.050 --> 1:07:14.092
No, thank you. I don't feel like it.

1:07:14.425 --> 1:07:16.592
Too bad. You like it so much.

1:07:16.717 --> 1:07:18.633
Aren't you feeling well?

1:07:18.925 --> 1:07:21.425
<i>Rosalia saying no to a fish head?</i>

1:07:21.717 --> 1:07:24.342
<i>A sign of definite progress!</i>

1:07:45.717 --> 1:07:47.383
Does your head still hurt?

1:07:48.008 --> 1:07:51.508
The doctor says this migraine
could become chronic.

1:07:51.842 --> 1:07:53.842
Too bad. Good night.

1:07:59.467 --> 1:08:01.883
<i>This is good, very good.
But be careful.</i>

1:08:01.967 --> 1:08:06.008
<i>Mustn't appear too resigned.
I'll let out a sigh.</i>

1:08:09.258 --> 1:08:13.425
- I'm sorry, Fefè.
- It's all right. Sleep.

1:08:18.217 --> 1:08:19.967
It's so hot today,

1:08:20.050 --> 1:08:22.592
but it's nice and cool in here.

1:08:23.592 --> 1:08:25.258
Why do you look at me like that?

1:08:28.717 --> 1:08:32.550
I'd like to paint your portrait one day.

1:08:33.425 --> 1:08:37.050
<i>Paint you as a madonna.</i>

1:08:38.258 --> 1:08:41.050
Or a harem girl.

1:08:44.758 --> 1:08:48.175
Have you never painted me
from memory?

1:08:49.467 --> 1:08:51.300
<i>Yes, a thousand times.
Everywhere I go.</i>

1:08:52.383 --> 1:08:55.508
During these long years,
no matter where I was.

1:08:56.883 --> 1:09:00.175
I even made a quick sketch of you
at Eptismania,

1:09:00.425 --> 1:09:02.383
on a Corinthian capitol, I remember.

1:09:02.508 --> 1:09:04.300
<i>All over the place, really:</i>

1:09:04.425 --> 1:09:08.133
<i>On marble tabletops,
in coffee shops and bars.</i>

1:09:08.217 --> 1:09:12.883
I did one in Panarea,
where I get away now and then.

1:09:13.008 --> 1:09:17.050
<i>It's still there,
in an old fisherman's hut.</i>

1:09:17.175 --> 1:09:18.758
Do you know Panarea?

1:09:18.883 --> 1:09:20.550
No. Is it pretty?

1:09:20.633 --> 1:09:22.925
Sea. Rocks. Nature.

1:09:24.508 --> 1:09:27.217
I'd love to see those portraits.

1:09:27.550 --> 1:09:29.675
A journey back in time.

1:09:29.967 --> 1:09:32.342
In search of lost dreams.

1:09:35.050 --> 1:09:36.383
<i>I beg of you, Carmelo.</i>

1:09:39.425 --> 1:09:40.592
Who is it?

1:09:42.342 --> 1:09:43.967
I've brought you some lemonade.

1:09:46.050 --> 1:09:47.175
Good.

1:09:47.258 --> 1:09:50.133
That idiot's always in the way!

1:09:57.050 --> 1:09:58.592
Warm, isn't it?

1:09:59.300 --> 1:10:01.217
I imagine everyone's asleep.

1:10:01.383 --> 1:10:04.217
<i>The baron and baroness
are sleeping, aren't they?</i>

1:10:05.050 --> 1:10:06.425
At this hour everyone's asleep.

1:10:06.592 --> 1:10:08.925
- Good.
- Except me.

1:10:11.883 --> 1:10:14.925
- Don't you ever nap after lunch?
- Never.

1:10:15.550 --> 1:10:17.717
I used to, once in a while,

1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:19.800
after straightening up the kitchen.

1:10:20.342 --> 1:10:21.717
But now...

1:10:22.758 --> 1:10:23.717
Now?

1:10:24.050 --> 1:10:27.008
I can't sleep anymore...

1:10:28.133 --> 1:10:29.633
even at night.

1:10:35.133 --> 1:10:36.550
<i>Let me look at you.</i>

1:10:38.467 --> 1:10:40.758
Antonello da Messina.

1:10:45.133 --> 1:10:49.050
Those adolescent martyrs
typical of Antonello.

1:10:49.133 --> 1:10:51.675
<i>Come on. Hold still.</i>

1:10:51.758 --> 1:10:55.717
Is that scoundrel trying
to corrupt my servant?

1:10:55.800 --> 1:10:58.175
I'd like to paint your portrait someday.

1:11:00.383 --> 1:11:03.133
Sisina, go to the drugstore
and get me some aspirin.

1:11:09.592 --> 1:11:11.925
How's the work going, Professor?

1:11:12.050 --> 1:11:14.175
It's going well. Not bad.

1:11:14.300 --> 1:11:17.550
Good. Keep it up.

1:11:17.633 --> 1:11:19.383
Thank you, Baron. Thank you.

1:11:32.758 --> 1:11:35.925
- In the name of the Father...
- Father, I've committed a grave sin.

1:11:36.050 --> 1:11:37.592
And the Holy Ghost.

1:11:38.342 --> 1:11:40.633
Now, who is he?

1:11:41.092 --> 1:11:44.633
Father, do you know Antonello?

1:11:44.717 --> 1:11:46.508
Antonello who?

1:11:46.633 --> 1:11:48.675
No, must not be from this parish.

1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:50.883
No, Father. He's from Messina.

1:11:51.050 --> 1:11:54.383
You had to go all that way
to get into trouble?

1:11:54.717 --> 1:11:58.550
- No, Father, I don't know him.
- So who is this Antonio?

1:11:58.633 --> 1:12:00.300
Antonello.

1:12:00.467 --> 1:12:03.800
No, the professor mentioned him to me.

1:12:03.883 --> 1:12:05.092
What professor?

1:12:05.383 --> 1:12:07.675
Don Carmelino, your godson.

1:12:07.758 --> 1:12:10.342
Let me see if I understand.
"He" is Carmelino?

1:12:10.425 --> 1:12:11.675
Yes, Father.

1:12:11.758 --> 1:12:15.550
You wretched girl!
He's married, with three kids!

1:12:17.383 --> 1:12:19.883
Why weren't you wearing a ring?

1:12:20.050 --> 1:12:21.550
Impostor!

1:12:21.883 --> 1:12:24.883
Calm down, Sisina. Stop shouting.

1:12:25.633 --> 1:12:29.008
I don't wear a ring because it's
unfashionable in the city.

1:12:29.592 --> 1:12:34.133
If you're married you should wear a ring.
How's a girl to know?

1:12:34.217 --> 1:12:35.342
Calm down.

1:12:35.467 --> 1:12:37.217
<i>Don't yell, Sisina.</i>

1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:40.342
<i>Calm down, please.</i>

1:12:41.883 --> 1:12:45.133
<i>Married with three children.
Keep calm.</i>

1:12:46.050 --> 1:12:49.300
<i>Let's consider things
in light of these new developments.</i>

1:12:49.758 --> 1:12:52.717
<i>He knows that the servant knows,
therefore he's nervous.</i>

1:12:52.842 --> 1:12:54.175
<i>Let's see.</i>

1:12:54.883 --> 1:12:57.592
<i>Let me put myself in his shoes
for a moment.</i>

1:12:57.842 --> 1:12:59.717
<i>Just for a moment.</i>

1:13:04.092 --> 1:13:06.550
I have to tell you something right now.

1:13:07.050 --> 1:13:10.508
I've hesitated to tell you.
But it's very important.

1:13:14.550 --> 1:13:16.675
What is it? Are you ill?

1:13:16.883 --> 1:13:19.383
Come, lie down on the couch.

1:13:21.842 --> 1:13:24.550
Rosalia, I'm unworthy of your love.
I've lied to you.

1:13:24.717 --> 1:13:27.050
I let you think I was a free man.

1:13:30.342 --> 1:13:32.717
I'm not single, Rosalia.

1:13:33.092 --> 1:13:34.883
I'm married just like you.

1:13:35.175 --> 1:13:38.883
I've betrayed the solemn oath
I took 12 years ago.

1:13:39.717 --> 1:13:41.092
Forgive me.

1:13:41.217 --> 1:13:44.675
But the man you see before you
is still the loneliest man alive.

1:13:44.883 --> 1:13:46.508
I swear it!

1:13:47.550 --> 1:13:49.883
My poor Carmelino.

1:14:00.383 --> 1:14:01.633
<i>My love!</i>

1:14:03.842 --> 1:14:05.342
Yes, Papa.

1:14:05.967 --> 1:14:07.592
<i>Is someone in there with you?</i>

1:14:08.425 --> 1:14:11.467
No. Why would anyone be in here with me?

1:14:11.550 --> 1:14:13.175
I thought I heard...

1:14:13.258 --> 1:14:15.717
Go to bed, Papa. Sleep well.

1:14:40.633 --> 1:14:42.258
Damn it.

1:15:01.342 --> 1:15:04.133
Matilde. Donna Rosalia. Baron.

1:15:04.717 --> 1:15:06.050
Good-bye once again.

1:15:54.258 --> 1:15:55.342
<i>My love!</i>

1:15:57.592 --> 1:16:00.050
No, don't go! Come here.

1:16:00.133 --> 1:16:01.675
<i>I love you!</i>

1:16:01.717 --> 1:16:03.842
You're mine.

1:16:04.258 --> 1:16:06.883
Nothing in this world can stop our love.

1:16:09.050 --> 1:16:11.467
You and I are alone. Alone!

1:16:11.550 --> 1:16:14.842
We've waited 12 years for this
moment without knowing it.

1:16:15.217 --> 1:16:16.592
- Admit it.
- Yes!

1:16:16.717 --> 1:16:18.342
Well, then? My life!

1:16:20.217 --> 1:16:22.592
<i>Not like this. Tomorrow.</i>

1:16:22.592 --> 1:16:25.592
Tomorrow. But first promise me something.

1:16:26.092 --> 1:16:29.550
Anything at all. But why tomorrow?

1:16:29.842 --> 1:16:31.842
Tomorrow is Thursday, isn't it?

1:16:32.467 --> 1:16:35.050
I was thinking that tomorrow...

1:16:45.342 --> 1:16:48.092
<i>Tomorrow... a promise.</i>

1:16:49.217 --> 1:16:52.842
<i>What promise? And why tomorrow?</i>

1:16:53.217 --> 1:16:55.508
TOMORROW

1:16:55.592 --> 1:16:57.383
TODAY

1:16:59.217 --> 1:17:03.633
<i>Preceded by scandal, controversy,
protest, critical outcry and hosannas,</i>

1:17:03.717 --> 1:17:06.425
<i>a sensational film had opened in town.</i>

1:17:07.133 --> 1:17:10.175
<i>The priest of San Filmino
railed against it,</i>

1:17:10.300 --> 1:17:12.925
<i>warning his flock to boycott it,</i>

1:17:13.050 --> 1:17:14.925
<i>but to little effect.</i>

1:17:15.050 --> 1:17:17.217
Orgies worthy of Tiberius!

1:17:17.300 --> 1:17:20.842
Wife-swapping! Striptease!
Let's go, guys!

1:17:25.008 --> 1:17:27.467
<i>We'd never seen anything like it.</i>

1:17:27.550 --> 1:17:30.217
<i>Not even all the chairs from the bar
piled into the theater</i>

1:17:30.342 --> 1:17:33.592
<i>could hold the huge audience
that assembled.</i>

1:17:35.092 --> 1:17:36.925
<i>They even came from the countryside,</i>

1:17:37.050 --> 1:17:39.717
<i>riding for miles on horseback,</i>

1:17:39.800 --> 1:17:43.467
<i>making the gentlemen of Agramonte
anxious for their wives' virtue.</i>

1:17:43.925 --> 1:17:47.008
<i>Finally, Don Ciccio Matara took over
organization of the event,</i>

1:17:47.133 --> 1:17:50.092
<i>and with great efficiency,
I might add.</i>

1:17:50.217 --> 1:17:54.050
Papa, three hours locked up
with all those people?

1:17:54.383 --> 1:17:56.550
I just couldn't bear it.

1:17:57.217 --> 1:17:59.425
Have you really got another headache?

1:17:59.842 --> 1:18:03.092
Then I'll stay home too.
- No, there's no need.

1:18:03.425 --> 1:18:05.925
I'll just take an aspirin
and go to bed.

1:18:06.050 --> 1:18:07.758
You go ahead.

1:18:08.383 --> 1:18:10.467
Oh, what a headache.

1:18:10.550 --> 1:18:14.300
- Pickles get you too excited.
- And you should know.

1:18:14.383 --> 1:18:16.508
The older you get,
the dirtier your mind gets!

1:18:16.633 --> 1:18:19.217
Sisina, take these away.

1:18:19.342 --> 1:18:22.842
Leave your door open tonight
and I'll tell you all about the movie.

1:18:23.133 --> 1:18:25.425
Let's go, Gaetano.

1:18:25.842 --> 1:18:27.467
Good-bye, Rosalia.

1:18:29.342 --> 1:18:30.883
Good evening, Baroness.

1:18:31.633 --> 1:18:35.258
Did you ask Sisina to stay home
and keep you company?

1:18:35.550 --> 1:18:37.800
No, I'd rather she didn't.

1:18:38.092 --> 1:18:40.592
But the idiot says she's made
some kind of vow.

1:18:41.175 --> 1:18:44.300
- Minors under 16 can't get in anyway.
- That's right.

1:18:44.925 --> 1:18:47.467
- Take care of yourself, okay?
- Yes, dear.

1:18:47.550 --> 1:18:48.883
Good night.

1:18:49.008 --> 1:18:51.508
And have a good time.

1:19:01.967 --> 1:19:03.008
I'm coming.

1:19:03.133 --> 1:19:04.550
<i>Let's go, Fefè!</i>

1:19:05.050 --> 1:19:06.633
My cigarettes.

1:19:21.175 --> 1:19:25.175
<i>It has to happen here.
Not in our room.</i>

1:19:25.258 --> 1:19:27.425
<i>She wouldn't be capable of that.</i>

1:20:45.175 --> 1:20:47.383
A great-looking specimen.

1:20:47.675 --> 1:20:49.758
But I can tell she has no soul.

1:21:23.217 --> 1:21:29.133
<i>The odious images conjured up
by that anonymous letter tormented him.</i>

1:21:29.217 --> 1:21:31.717
<i>With great reluctance,
he gave in to the impulse</i>

1:21:31.800 --> 1:21:33.592
<i>to run home and see for himself.</i>

1:21:33.717 --> 1:21:37.383
<i>Though he felt it too insulting
to his beloved life companion,</i>

1:21:37.508 --> 1:21:41.633
<i>a gnawing suspicion had taken
hold of his tortured mind.</i>

1:21:41.717 --> 1:21:46.175
<i>His hesitant and uncertain steps led him
along the fateful path to his home,</i>

1:21:46.300 --> 1:21:50.717
<i>where all seemed normal,
tranquil and peaceful.</i>

1:21:51.008 --> 1:21:54.217
<i>What if he's already inside?
Those snakes!</i>

1:22:02.092 --> 1:22:03.758
<i>Good heavens! Where's she going?</i>

1:22:05.717 --> 1:22:08.342
<i>And why does she have a suitcase?</i>

1:22:10.675 --> 1:22:12.467
<i>The 9:43 train!</i>

1:22:13.217 --> 1:22:14.508
<i>The gun!</i>

1:22:14.717 --> 1:22:16.467
<i>Curse them!</i>

1:22:19.675 --> 1:22:20.883
<i>To the station!</i>

1:22:21.050 --> 1:22:23.592
<i>I could catch them
with suitcases at the station.</i>

1:22:23.717 --> 1:22:25.592
<i>That could count as catching
them in the act.</i>

1:22:25.717 --> 1:22:28.175
<i>It has to count. It has to!</i>

1:22:28.592 --> 1:22:32.092
<i>He'd found the house empty,
the nest deserted.</i>

1:22:32.217 --> 1:22:36.508
<i>Overtaken by a natural impulse
for revenge, he ran like a madman</i>

1:22:36.592 --> 1:22:39.383
<i>toward the station.
Faster and faster. On and on!</i>

1:22:39.508 --> 1:22:41.508
<i>To kill... perhaps.</i>

1:22:41.592 --> 1:22:45.300
<i>But perhaps also in desperate hope
of catching his unfaithful spouse</i>

1:22:45.383 --> 1:22:47.717
<i>and stopping her from leaving.
Who knows?</i>

1:22:49.342 --> 1:22:52.300
<i>But when he saw them there together,</i>

1:22:52.425 --> 1:22:54.508
<i>her and her lover...</i>

1:22:57.175 --> 1:23:01.217
<i>The 9:43 train. Right on time.</i>

1:23:01.717 --> 1:23:02.633
<i>Curse them!</i>

1:23:08.425 --> 1:23:11.592
<i>The next day, a sleepy calm
reigned in Agramonte,</i>

1:23:11.717 --> 1:23:13.342
<i>as if nothing had happened.</i>

1:23:13.800 --> 1:23:17.342
<i>The adulterers' elopement
had unhinged part of my plan.</i>

1:23:17.800 --> 1:23:20.550
<i>"He who causes the death
of spouse, daughter or sister,</i>

1:23:20.633 --> 1:23:23.217
<i>upon discovering her
in illegitimate carnal relations,</i>

1:23:23.342 --> 1:23:26.717
<i>and in the heat of passion caused
by the offense to his honor, etc."</i>

1:23:26.883 --> 1:23:30.133
<i>The law was exceptionally clear
on this matter.</i>

1:23:30.342 --> 1:23:33.800
<i>"Heat of passion" equals "catching them
in the act" plus "offended honor".</i>

1:23:34.133 --> 1:23:36.800
<i>Therefore, having failed
to catch them in the act,</i>

1:23:36.883 --> 1:23:39.217
<i>I'd have to lay it on thick
with the offended honor,</i>

1:23:39.342 --> 1:23:43.717
<i>so the heat of passion could reach
the intensity required by the law.</i>

1:23:44.383 --> 1:23:48.925
<i>I then remembered a few tricks
I'd learned in the military.</i>

1:23:56.592 --> 1:23:58.092
104.

1:24:07.508 --> 1:24:08.633
Why?

1:24:09.883 --> 1:24:12.883
Why did you abandon me?

1:24:20.092 --> 1:24:23.008
<i>Dr. Talamone was the biggest
gossip in town.</i>

1:24:23.342 --> 1:24:26.342
<i>Public opinion held my stock
in a definite decline.</i>

1:24:26.425 --> 1:24:28.258
<i>In fact, it took a nosedive.</i>

1:24:41.633 --> 1:24:43.633
<i>My friends from the social club</i>

1:24:43.717 --> 1:24:47.800
<i>at first adopted an attitude
of pained and vivid compassion.</i>

1:24:48.008 --> 1:24:49.675
<i>But only at first.</i>

1:25:23.258 --> 1:25:25.925
He's locked himself in there
since that tragic day.

1:25:26.050 --> 1:25:30.300
He won't see anyone or eat anything.
My poor son.

1:25:37.092 --> 1:25:40.883
<i>If this man had discovered his wife
in flagrant adultery,</i>

1:25:41.050 --> 1:25:44.925
<i>then yes, gentlemen of the jury,
he might have killed.</i>

1:25:45.050 --> 1:25:47.717
<i>But not after the fact.
Not in cold blood.</i>

1:25:47.842 --> 1:25:50.883
<i>He couldn't give chase
to the adulterers</i>

1:25:51.092 --> 1:25:53.175
<i>inflamed with hatred.</i>

1:25:53.383 --> 1:25:55.342
<i>No, gentlemen of the court.</i>

1:25:55.550 --> 1:25:58.175
<i>He lay there</i>

1:25:58.300 --> 1:26:02.050
<i>in a state of dumb despondency
that numbed his senses.</i>

1:26:02.217 --> 1:26:06.800
<i>Fefè, eat something for your mama.</i>

1:26:07.092 --> 1:26:09.383
No, go away.

1:26:09.883 --> 1:26:11.800
Leave me alone.

1:26:16.925 --> 1:26:20.383
<i>Meanwhile, rumors spread
through town like an oil spill.</i>

1:26:20.508 --> 1:26:22.008
<i>All sorts of things were said,</i>

1:26:22.175 --> 1:26:25.550
<i>the substance of which
could be summed up a single word:</i>

1:26:25.633 --> 1:26:27.175
<i>Cuckold.</i>

1:26:31.258 --> 1:26:35.133
Now we see the results of such
shameless pictures.

1:26:35.467 --> 1:26:38.092
Unworthy mystifications of art,

1:26:38.217 --> 1:26:43.175
that flaunt and exalt sin.
Debauchery and immorality.

1:26:47.258 --> 1:26:51.508
It's a point of fact that historically,
even here in the south,

1:26:51.592 --> 1:26:55.050
which I'm pleased to visit for
the first time,

1:26:55.217 --> 1:26:58.508
the moment's come to face the age-old
problem of women's emancipation

1:26:58.592 --> 1:27:01.592
as it's been confronted
and solved, for example,

1:27:01.717 --> 1:27:03.758
by our Chinese brothers.

1:27:03.883 --> 1:27:08.508
Therefore, I invite you to express
your democratic opinion on these facts.

1:27:08.592 --> 1:27:09.717
In other words,

1:27:09.842 --> 1:27:14.050
what is the calm, objective
judgment that Mrs. Cefalù deserves?

1:27:14.717 --> 1:27:16.717
Whore!

1:27:25.217 --> 1:27:27.883
<i>Finally, the anonymous letters began.</i>

1:27:28.592 --> 1:27:31.800
<i>In Agramonte the anonymous letter
is a prized handicraft.</i>

1:27:32.175 --> 1:27:34.758
<i>We start practicing as children
on sheets torn from notebooks,</i>

1:27:34.883 --> 1:27:37.842
<i>graduating to polished specimens
forged by expert adult hands.</i>

1:27:38.258 --> 1:27:41.050
<i>In this orgy of accusation,
mockery and defamation,</i>

1:27:41.133 --> 1:27:42.967
<i>we'd all been lumped together.</i>

1:27:43.175 --> 1:27:47.800
<i>Not only had I been dishonored,
but the entire Cefalù household:</i>

1:27:47.883 --> 1:27:51.467
<i>Living members, future descendants,
and anyone associated with us.</i>

1:27:51.550 --> 1:27:56.175
<i>Even future generations
in any way related to the Cefalù name</i>

1:27:56.383 --> 1:27:59.383
<i>saw their very existence threatened.</i>

1:27:59.467 --> 1:28:02.675
<i>In short, everyone was brought into it,
without exception,</i>

1:28:02.758 --> 1:28:04.217
<i>including the servants.</i>

1:28:05.550 --> 1:28:09.508
<i>But for me, those letters
were worth their weight in gold.</i>

1:28:09.842 --> 1:28:13.050
<i>I cataloged them
in the most meticulous fashion.</i>

1:28:14.925 --> 1:28:16.717
"Cuckold".

1:28:23.217 --> 1:28:25.008
"Cuckold". Good.

1:28:29.383 --> 1:28:31.508
"We stand behind you".

1:28:38.550 --> 1:28:40.092
<i>"Mulè and Sons regrets..."</i>

1:28:40.217 --> 1:28:42.842
I'll let him know he's a coward!

1:28:44.008 --> 1:28:46.550
- Coward!
- Calm down.

1:28:46.675 --> 1:28:48.800
Forget that gravedigger!

1:28:49.092 --> 1:28:51.508
No one will want his sister now!

1:28:51.800 --> 1:28:53.967
He's dishonored us all!

1:28:54.258 --> 1:28:56.342
Coward!

1:28:58.883 --> 1:29:00.425
My son!

1:29:01.467 --> 1:29:03.883
- Rosario left you.
- Yes, he left me.

1:29:04.217 --> 1:29:05.592
Did he tell you in person?

1:29:05.883 --> 1:29:09.217
No, he sent this letter. Read it.

1:29:19.717 --> 1:29:23.175
I'm sorry, Agnesina. I'm really sorry.

1:29:27.842 --> 1:29:30.800
You're a cuckold, and proud of it!

1:29:35.883 --> 1:29:38.842
<i>Lower, ever lower.</i>

1:29:40.217 --> 1:29:44.717
<i>Let's sink into the mud
up to our necks.</i>

1:29:46.842 --> 1:29:49.342
<i>Everyone shunned him openly</i>

1:29:49.467 --> 1:29:52.342
<i>because he'd been branded
by the most vile disgrace possible.</i>

1:29:56.550 --> 1:30:00.217
<i>I was a leper. I might as well
have had the plague,</i>

1:30:00.383 --> 1:30:02.883
<i>like a character
from a novel by Manzoni.</i>

1:30:13.592 --> 1:30:15.842
<i>Hear the latest news
on the cuckold front!</i>

1:30:18.717 --> 1:30:20.883
My respects, Don Ferdinando.

1:30:41.508 --> 1:30:42.967
<i>Interesting.</i>

1:30:43.092 --> 1:30:45.550
<i>Up until then, no one
had bothered telling me</i>

1:30:45.675 --> 1:30:48.175
<i>where the hell the two runaways
had holed up.</i>

1:30:48.800 --> 1:30:52.508
<i>And this was rather annoying,
because I, the wounded party.</i>

1:30:52.800 --> 1:30:55.717
<i>Couldn't go about openly
gathering information.</i>

1:30:55.800 --> 1:30:58.217
<i>I was supposed to just suddenly
up and disappear.</i>

1:30:59.008 --> 1:31:02.508
<i>Don Ciccio Matara,
with his circle of mysterious friends,</i>

1:31:02.633 --> 1:31:04.425
<i>might be able to help me.</i>

1:31:05.008 --> 1:31:07.883
<i>But the initiative clearly
had to come from him.</i>

1:31:08.425 --> 1:31:13.883
<i>To be honest, that day I got the feeling
he might be leaning in that direction.</i>

1:31:25.133 --> 1:31:26.967
<i>Dear Papa and Mama,</i>

1:31:27.258 --> 1:31:32.425
<i>today I took my Latin exam,
and it went quite well.</i>

1:31:33.258 --> 1:31:35.383
"Dear Papa and Mama".

1:31:39.842 --> 1:31:41.133
That means...

1:31:45.217 --> 1:31:46.467
<i>Help!</i>

1:31:47.092 --> 1:31:49.133
<i>Matilde, help!</i>

1:31:50.717 --> 1:31:52.633
Calogero!

1:31:54.217 --> 1:31:55.675
Help!

1:31:58.883 --> 1:32:00.050
Carmela!

1:32:02.217 --> 1:32:04.175
It's Calogero!

1:32:05.925 --> 1:32:08.675
Gaetano! Matilde!

1:32:11.092 --> 1:32:13.383
<i>Call the doctor, quick!</i>

1:32:22.300 --> 1:32:23.342
You slug!

1:32:24.342 --> 1:32:25.342
Me?

1:32:25.467 --> 1:32:26.842
Why?

1:32:44.717 --> 1:32:46.050
Holy Mother of God!

1:32:47.092 --> 1:32:49.383
Quick, a glass of water!

1:32:51.175 --> 1:32:54.092
- What is it?
- Something terrible's happened.

1:33:20.550 --> 1:33:22.550
<i>Ferdinando, my love,</i>

1:33:22.675 --> 1:33:25.592
<i>a friend told me what happened to you.</i>

1:33:26.175 --> 1:33:30.550
<i>My love, I wish I were there
to share your every pain.</i>

1:33:30.633 --> 1:33:32.092
<i>But it can't be.</i>

1:33:32.550 --> 1:33:35.175
<i>Perhaps we're being punished
for our sin.</i>

1:33:35.550 --> 1:33:40.092
<i>Perhaps this is a sign our love
will never be blessed.</i>

1:33:41.342 --> 1:33:46.550
<i>Forever yours no matter what happens...
Angela.</i>

1:34:40.842 --> 1:34:42.217
What a tragedy.

1:34:42.550 --> 1:34:44.633
Poor guy's heart just gave out.

1:34:44.883 --> 1:34:46.717
But you mustn't take it too hard.

1:34:46.883 --> 1:34:51.467
We all knew Don Calogero had a
heart condition.

1:34:52.717 --> 1:34:55.717
Now it's time for you
to make a move, Don Fefè.

1:34:55.842 --> 1:35:00.217
Your family was well respected.
The entire town is waiting.

1:35:00.342 --> 1:35:03.133
Couldn't you...
Do I make myself clear?

1:35:03.383 --> 1:35:06.092
We've called certain friends into action.

1:35:06.217 --> 1:35:07.717
Give me 24 hours.

1:35:08.050 --> 1:35:11.092
We'll find out where they are.

1:35:23.883 --> 1:35:25.717
Have courage.

1:35:48.383 --> 1:35:50.883
Are you Baron Don Ferdinando Cefalù?

1:35:51.217 --> 1:35:52.675
My name is Immacolata Patanè.

1:35:54.592 --> 1:35:56.175
I'm his wife.

1:35:57.300 --> 1:36:01.050
I came all the way from Catania
to find out what you intend to do.

1:36:01.675 --> 1:36:03.300
I really don't...

1:36:14.967 --> 1:36:18.383
<i>Yes, now I'd been provoked.</i>

1:36:18.508 --> 1:36:21.467
<i>Gravely provoked, I might add.</i>

1:36:44.758 --> 1:36:48.842
<i>Don Ciccio Matara had kept his promise.</i>

1:37:26.967 --> 1:37:27.925
Immacolata!

1:37:54.883 --> 1:37:56.842
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

1:37:57.383 --> 1:37:58.883
I avenged my honor.

1:38:03.092 --> 1:38:04.675
But...

1:38:05.883 --> 1:38:07.967
What about mine?

1:38:43.842 --> 1:38:48.258
BARON CEFALÙ KILLS WIFE
CAUGHT HIDING OUT WITH LOVER

1:38:59.008 --> 1:39:04.342
<i>In this picturesque corner of Sicily,
many have died in the name of honor.</i>

1:39:05.133 --> 1:39:07.258
<i>Poor Rosalia, you didn't deserve it.</i>

1:39:07.592 --> 1:39:12.925
<i>But I know you rest in peace,
with your naïve little dreams.</i>

1:39:13.217 --> 1:39:16.467
<i>I really did love you in my own way.</i>

1:39:16.758 --> 1:39:19.175
<i>But you were too much.</i>

1:39:19.258 --> 1:39:21.842
<i>You would ask,
"How much do you love me?"</i>

1:39:22.133 --> 1:39:24.592
<i>You were hungry for love,
my poor Rosalia.</i>

1:39:24.883 --> 1:39:27.800
<i>Too hungry.</i>

1:39:29.883 --> 1:39:31.550
ONE LAW FOR ALL

1:39:31.842 --> 1:39:36.342
<i>There's not much to say about the trial.
It went much as I expected.</i>

1:39:36.883 --> 1:39:38.467
Gentlemen of the jury...

1:39:42.925 --> 1:39:46.717
<i>The attorney, De Marzi, was brilliant,
impassioned and sarcastic.</i>

1:39:46.800 --> 1:39:48.092
<i>Moving and moved.</i>

1:39:48.217 --> 1:39:52.633
<i>He played the entire scale of emotions
with confident precision.</i>

1:39:52.883 --> 1:39:55.258
<i>He didn't go so far as to
mention the Crusades,</i>

1:39:55.425 --> 1:39:58.300
<i>but he did cite Othello
and our countryman Turiddu.</i>

1:39:58.717 --> 1:39:59.925
<i>Mama was there.</i>

1:40:00.050 --> 1:40:02.717
<i>Crying, the poor soul.</i>

1:40:02.842 --> 1:40:06.633
<i>Yes, even I was close to tears.</i>

1:40:06.717 --> 1:40:08.550
<i>Then he brought my father into it:</i>

1:40:08.717 --> 1:40:10.758
<i>A debauched corrupter of innocents,</i>

1:40:10.883 --> 1:40:13.925
<i>undoubtedly infected with some
unmentionable disease,</i>

1:40:14.050 --> 1:40:16.008
<i>producer of debts and bastards galore.</i>

1:40:16.092 --> 1:40:18.133
<i>Clearly, grave hereditary dysfunction</i>

1:40:18.217 --> 1:40:20.925
<i>could be added to my wounded honor.</i>

1:40:21.050 --> 1:40:23.258
<i>Finally, he produced the widow Patanè.</i>

1:40:23.550 --> 1:40:26.175
<i>He couldn't produce her children,
as they were still very young.</i>

1:40:26.300 --> 1:40:28.467
<i>And the penal code forbade it.</i>

1:40:28.550 --> 1:40:30.133
<i>But he showed us their pictures.</i>

1:40:30.217 --> 1:40:33.675
<i>The image of those poor orphans
helped my case to no end.</i>

1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:35.342
<i>I don't really know why.</i>

1:40:35.425 --> 1:40:37.508
<i>Perhaps because in Italy, children...</i>

1:40:38.217 --> 1:40:40.092
<i>Well, children will always be children.</i>

1:40:41.092 --> 1:40:43.258
Silence! His Honor is entering
the courtroom.

1:40:53.925 --> 1:40:55.717
In the name of the Italian people...

1:40:57.050 --> 1:40:59.342
<i>Three years. The minimum.</i>

1:40:59.592 --> 1:41:03.175
<i>Actually, a little less than the minimum.
I received a small pardon.</i>

1:41:03.258 --> 1:41:06.550
<i>I won't say I'd predicted it,
but I was sort of counting on it.</i>

1:41:06.758 --> 1:41:10.217
<i>On average there's a pardon
every three years, so it was my due.</i>

1:41:11.092 --> 1:41:15.592
<i>I can't say it was a pleasant three years,
but it's behind me now.</i>

1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:25.842
<i>I was suddenly seized by a strange fear.</i>

1:41:27.050 --> 1:41:30.133
- Waiter, take care of the bill.
- Thank you, sir.

1:41:32.758 --> 1:41:35.717
<i>During those months
I'd received letters from Angela.</i>

1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:38.342
<i>But only a few.
And they were rather vague.</i>

1:41:38.467 --> 1:41:42.092
<i>She always said she prayed for me
and made constant vows.</i>

1:41:42.217 --> 1:41:46.050
<i>Perhaps it was the natural shyness
of our southern women.</i>

1:41:46.508 --> 1:41:47.717
<i>Or perhaps...</i>

1:41:47.925 --> 1:41:50.842
<i>No, it couldn't be.
That would be too unfair.</i>

1:41:56.967 --> 1:41:58.508
He's here!

1:42:02.050 --> 1:42:03.675
He's here!

1:42:25.550 --> 1:42:27.925
My beloved son!

1:43:26.383 --> 1:43:29.717
A FEW MONTHS LATER

1:44:05.092 --> 1:44:08.883
<i>Yes, life begins at 40.</i>

1:44:09.383 --> 1:44:11.300
<i>It really is true.</i>
