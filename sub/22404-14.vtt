is activate this.

and then uh...

the nuclear pulse generator,

- Then that goes there.
Then I, right there...

17:38.223 --> 17:40.684
- Making sure that the nuclear
variance is stabilized...

- And uhh...the thing,
and the thing.

and the Asian countries...

- Now we lock it
onto the dinner table...

- And I do this.

- Oh Roger!
- That's right.

18:59.304 --> 19:02.766
- Really, Lacey?
You'd respect a man

19:02.850 --> 19:04.017
who'd steal someone
else's invention

19:04.101 --> 19:06.979
and pretend
like it was his?!?

- Shut up.

to teleport ourselves
to England.

you guys.

19:30.669 --> 19:31.962

- Tell 'em, tell 'em,
tell 'em.

- Uh, hey hey Roger...
uh...

19:36.008 --> 19:38.844
look, my maid just reminded me

19:38.927 --> 19:40.888
that the teleporter
hasn't been perfected yet.

19:40.971 --> 19:44.016
- Yeah, it can't transport two
people at the same time.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.767
- Yeah and If you try it,

19:45.851 --> 19:48.020
it might do something terrible.

- Oh Ray, you always
were a terrible liar.

what's going on...
what is that?

- M'm'my device...
it took Lacey and Roger

20:37.819 --> 20:41.740
and it turned them
into this...one...thing.

20:48.413 --> 20:51.291
- Well, what do we
do with them? It.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.173
- Schwoz, do...do you know
a way to separate them,

20:58.256 --> 20:59.675
y'know turn them back
into two normal people?

20:59.758 --> 21:03.011
- Do I?!?
No.

- What? Do we take
'em to the hospital? I mean...
