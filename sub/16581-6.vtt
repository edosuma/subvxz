WEBVTT

00:12.263 --> 00:15.096
[vehicle approaching,
horn blaring]

00:26.444 --> 00:27.650
[engine shuts off]

00:28.738 --> 00:29.648
Where were you?

00:30.781 --> 00:31.861
What?

00:32.074 --> 00:33.280
You missed
our first deposition.

00:33.493 --> 00:35.324
Didn't you say you wanted to be
there, you wanted to fight?

00:36.078 --> 00:37.238
Idid.
Ido.

00:37.455 --> 00:39.787
Well, a key part of fighting
is showing up,

00:39.999 --> 00:42.160
you know,
for the actual fight.

00:42.627 --> 00:43.742
l was working.

00:43.961 --> 00:46.543
You realize this is our only chance
to question the witnesses

00:46.756 --> 00:48.712
that Barlow's attorney
is calling to the stand, right?

00:48.925 --> 00:50.506
It's the only time
we get to hear

00:50.718 --> 00:52.800
what they're gonna say in court
and get it on the record.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.968
I mean, these
depositions are crucial,

00:55.181 --> 00:57.217
because if the witnesses change
their story later,

00:57.433 --> 00:59.173
I can discredit them
in front of a jury,

00:59.393 --> 01:02.260
which I would have liked to do
with that obnoxious P.|. Monte,

01:02.480 --> 01:04.220
who I deposed today.

01:05.316 --> 01:06.271
Alone.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.774
-|'|| be at the next one.
-I hope so.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.069
Because while I know
what questions to ask,

01:12.281 --> 01:14.738
you know, I don't know
if they're telling the truth.

01:15.368 --> 01:16.949
Not unless you're there
with me.

01:18.037 --> 01:21.871
Also, Barlow's lawyer has added
two new witnesses.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.199
I didn't think you could add
witnesses this late in the day.

01:24.418 --> 01:28.252
Yeah, he can't, unless
new evidence has come to light

01:28.422 --> 01:32.836
or unless he's Tucker Baggett
and best buddies with the judge,

01:33.052 --> 01:35.293
who happens to be
his old fraternity brother

01:35.513 --> 01:37.094
and godfather
to his twin boys.

01:37.306 --> 01:39.297
-Want a beer?
-Uh, yeah.

01:39.517 --> 01:41.883
Who are these two new witnesses
he's calling in?

01:42.103 --> 01:46.187
Well, uh, the first is...
Victoria Moretti.

01:47.984 --> 01:50.020
He's calling Vic?
[telephone ringing]

01:50.236 --> 01:52.192
I thought we were calling her
as a character witness.

01:52.405 --> 01:53.815
Why would Tucker
call her in?

01:54.657 --> 01:55.897
I don't know.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.483
That's why I need you
at the depositions.

01:58.703 --> 02:00.534
My hunch is that he's gonna
manipulate her

02:00.746 --> 02:02.532
into saying defamatory
things about you.

02:02.748 --> 02:03.908
[ringing continues]

02:04.125 --> 02:05.956
But you said you have a good
relationship.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.250
[answering machine
beeps, clicks]
She likes you, right?

02:08.462 --> 02:09.713
Happy employee?

02:09.922 --> 02:11.753
[Vic]
Damn it, Walt. Pick up.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.172
It's me -- Vic.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.963
Are you screening your calls?

02:16.178 --> 02:17.463
Come on, Walt.
Pick up.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.295
I know you're there.

02:19.515 --> 02:20.630
-Hey, Vic.
-Hey.

02:20.850 --> 02:21.930
So, the FBI called.

02:22.143 --> 02:23.679
Ferg hasn't shown up
with the prisoner.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.976
-You haven't been able
to reach Ferg?
-No.

02:26.188 --> 02:28.600
And unlike some people,
he always answers his phone.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.315
There's only one way
he could have gone.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.064
-Dahill Road.
-Yeah. Yeah.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.066
l'll retrace his steps,
see if I can find anything.

02:39.118 --> 02:41.325
[siren wails]

02:44.165 --> 02:46.156
[engine shuts off]

03:59.699 --> 04:00.404
[bottles clink]

04:02.368 --> 04:03.574
[door opens]

04:03.786 --> 04:06.118
[Panting]

04:06.414 --> 04:07.950
[indistinct shouting]
You got to help me.

04:08.165 --> 04:10.656
You -- He's really gonna kill me
this time.

04:10.876 --> 04:11.706
-Who?
-Shit!

04:11.919 --> 04:13.375
-What?
-Shit!

04:14.171 --> 04:16.913
[man] Think I won't find you?!
Oh, I'll find you, bitch!

04:17.133 --> 04:18.623
-You know I will!
-Please. Please.

04:18.843 --> 04:20.379
He will find me,
and he will kill me.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.800
Here.
Stay in here.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.219
Stay, stay, stay.

04:25.224 --> 04:27.215
[man] God damn it, Mandy!
You get back here!

04:28.269 --> 04:29.554
You know I'm gonna find you!

04:30.187 --> 04:31.393
You get out here right now!

04:32.523 --> 04:35.435
-You know I'll find you, bitch!
-Hey. Hey. What's going on?

04:35.985 --> 04:37.725
You see a lying,
stealing Indian girl?

04:40.197 --> 04:41.403
but I did see a
woman run by.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.071
She looked like
she was in trouble.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.364
Yeah, she's in
trouble, all right.

04:44.577 --> 04:46.738
The bitch is a goddamn thief.
Which way did she go?

04:47.580 --> 04:48.444
Which way?!

04:49.498 --> 04:50.829
I think she went that way.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.244
Shit.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.452
[footsteps fading]

04:59.383 --> 05:00.884
Anyone from the
state police call?

05:01.093 --> 05:02.924
No.But"

05:03.137 --> 05:04.627
Eddie Harp is a very important
witness to us.

05:04.847 --> 05:06.212
Where the hell is he?

05:06.432 --> 05:07.672
Call the phone company.

05:07.892 --> 05:09.302
Maybe they can put a trace
on Ferg's cell.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.554
Oh, well, I'm happy to hear
that the phone company

05:11.771 --> 05:13.932
has a better chance of finding
my prisoner than the sheriff.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.308
You're worried
about your prisoner.

05:15.524 --> 05:16.934
I'm worried
about my deputy.

05:18.027 --> 05:20.518
I found Ferg's, uh, Charger
abandoned on Dahill Road.

05:20.738 --> 05:23.901
Bullet casings everywhere,
no bodies, hardly any blood.

05:24.116 --> 05:24.741
What?

05:26.160 --> 05:27.775
This wasn't a difficult
assignment.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.111
Transporting a prisoner
should not result

05:30.331 --> 05:31.741
in a total shit show.
[Ruby] Walter.

05:35.169 --> 05:35.828
Where are you going?

05:36.045 --> 05:37.205
We're in the middle
of something.

05:37.963 --> 05:41.000
-I need to take this.
-Are you kidding me? Sheriff!

05:43.344 --> 05:44.333
Hello?

05:44.553 --> 05:46.805
Jesus Christ.
Can't believe this.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.424
Who is Eddie Harp,

05:48.641 --> 05:49.972
and why didn't you tell us
how dangerous he is?

05:50.184 --> 05:52.095
-You didn't think to ask.
-l'm asking now.

05:52.770 --> 05:53.634
You know what?

05:53.854 --> 05:56.140
A 13-year-old girl
caught shoplifting in a mall

05:56.357 --> 05:58.723
would be too dangerous for
Deputy Ferguson to deal with.

05:58.943 --> 06:01.059
I can't believe the sheriff
let him transport my prisoner.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.984
Ferg is a damn
good cop, all right?

06:03.197 --> 06:04.482
-You should have told us.
-l'm amazed.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.279
You know, I am truly amazed

06:06.492 --> 06:08.699
at the decisions
that your sheriff makes.

06:08.911 --> 06:11.152
This is reckless endangerment
of the people.

06:12.665 --> 06:14.496
Doesn't Sheriff Longmire
have a civil suit against him

06:14.708 --> 06:15.743
for a wrongful death?

06:16.210 --> 06:17.950
Yeah.
That the FBI cleared him of.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.832
Yeah. Well, I certainly didn't,
'cause I would --

06:22.466 --> 06:23.672
Are you kidding me?

06:24.844 --> 06:25.833
[engine starts]

06:26.053 --> 06:27.338
What the hell is he doing?

06:27.555 --> 06:29.637
[engine revs, tires squeal]

06:40.276 --> 06:41.982
Hey.
He's gone.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.144
He didn't see you walk
back here, did he?

06:45.406 --> 06:47.943
No. I waited out front
for 15 minutes just to be sure.

06:48.701 --> 06:49.690
Right.

06:51.412 --> 06:54.199
So, uh, what's up
with this place, anyway?

06:54.415 --> 06:56.076
I thought I was running
into the Dalts' house.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.877
Cool-ass family.
They used to always help me out.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.292
Yeah, the --
Yeah, the Dalts.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.953
They, um, they moved.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.629
[laughs] They moved?

07:04.842 --> 07:06.628
They can't move anywhere.
They're broke as shit.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.175
Their house
got foreclosed on.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.382
-Well, that sucks.
-But there's a bright side.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.343
I'm opening a
legal-aid center here

07:13.559 --> 07:16.016
to help people in trouble
on the res.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.183
That's cute.

07:17.521 --> 07:20.058
So, uh, can I hang here
for a little bit longer?

07:20.274 --> 07:21.764
J.P.'s probably had a beer
and a shot by now,

07:21.984 --> 07:23.895
and it usually takes him three
to calm him down.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.612
You know the guy
who was chasing you?

07:25.821 --> 07:27.652
Yeah. J.P.

07:28.324 --> 07:29.234
Is he your boyfriend?

07:29.450 --> 07:31.315
[laughs] No.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.785
Ex.
Thank God.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.490
Now he's
someone else's problem.

07:37.333 --> 07:38.413
So, why is he chasing you?

07:38.626 --> 07:40.662
Well, l-l thought I lost
this necklace,

07:40.878 --> 07:43.790
and then I see it on the neck
of J.P.'s new wife.

07:44.548 --> 07:45.708
-Yeah.
-Whoa.

07:45.925 --> 07:48.667
That asshole stole it from me
and gave it to another woman.

07:48.886 --> 07:49.716
Right?

07:50.220 --> 07:52.472
So, l-l saw them
at the Blind Tiger just now

07:52.681 --> 07:54.091
and I took it back.

07:54.308 --> 07:56.469
You stole it
right off of his wife's neck.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.677
No, I didn't steal it.
It's mine.

07:59.897 --> 08:02.229
-| just took it back.
-Right.

08:02.441 --> 08:04.432
Oh, you can't --
you can't smoke in here.

08:04.652 --> 08:05.311
Mm.

08:06.612 --> 08:07.772
Crack a window.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.277
[engine shuts off]

08:25.255 --> 08:26.290
[bell chimes]

08:27.049 --> 08:29.256
[indistinct conversations]

08:44.900 --> 08:46.265
I'd give you my badge
and my gun,

08:46.485 --> 08:48.817
but...l don't have them
anymore.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.189
[chuckles]

08:51.031 --> 08:52.532
Ferg, what happened
out there?

08:57.037 --> 08:58.243
I'm on Dahill Road.

08:59.581 --> 09:04.245
And, uh, I see an 18-wheeler
blocking the road up ahead.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.083
But before I could back up,

09:09.299 --> 09:10.755
another vehicle pulls up
behind me.

09:11.468 --> 09:12.799
I knew something was off.

09:17.850 --> 09:19.841
[guns cocking]

09:29.653 --> 09:32.690
They, uh --
they pulled me out of the car.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.771
[guns cocking]

09:37.327 --> 09:43.118
They grabbed my gun and my phone
and my keys.

09:48.213 --> 09:53.458
And then they grab Eddie out of
the back seat and uncuff him.

09:56.472 --> 09:57.882
Can you describe
any of the men?

10:00.017 --> 10:01.473
[man] Look at me, buckaroo.
[groans]

10:01.685 --> 10:02.720
Look at me.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.219
You want to live, yeah?

10:05.898 --> 10:07.138
Mm-hmm.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.517
Then you'll forget
our faces.

10:16.825 --> 10:17.985
[Walt] Ferg.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.113
What'd they look like?

10:27.795 --> 10:29.535
It's all
just a little cloudy.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.715
Maybe I just need
some time to...

10:37.179 --> 10:40.763
you know,
just...clear my head...

10:42.851 --> 10:43.966
...get things straight.

10:45.104 --> 10:46.014
Yeah.

10:56.198 --> 10:57.404
This is ice-cold.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.357
How long
you been sitting here?

11:01.203 --> 11:02.238
For a while.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.123
lcouldn't call you.

11:15.592 --> 11:16.877
[Towson]
And what did you do next?

11:17.177 --> 11:18.678
I called Walt from the diner.

11:20.055 --> 11:24.048
Well, Deputy Ferguson,
your story is unassailable.

11:24.268 --> 11:27.476
It's almost like...
you were prepped.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.223
You know, maybe by a sheriff

11:29.439 --> 11:32.397
who strolled out of here
without letting anyone know,

11:32.609 --> 11:34.224
only to return an hour later

11:34.444 --> 11:36.901
with a missing deputy
and a bulletproof story.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.697
Let me ask you this,
Deputy.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.324
Why did it take you so long
to call it in?

11:43.537 --> 11:44.868
They took his phone.

11:45.330 --> 11:48.822
And then I had to walk
five miles to get to that diner.

11:51.336 --> 11:52.951
Did you have
a piece of apple pie

11:53.172 --> 11:54.537
from the diner's
glass dessert case

11:54.756 --> 11:56.166
before you decided
to check in?

11:57.009 --> 12:00.217
See, the bigger question is
why didn't they kill you?

12:01.096 --> 12:04.884
Or maybe I should ask
how much did they pay you

12:05.100 --> 12:07.216
to give them those extra hours
to get away?

12:07.394 --> 12:08.725
Why would they pay me?

12:08.937 --> 12:10.438
Because they're
the goddamn mob.

12:14.860 --> 12:18.102
And most people
don't get to enjoy apple pie

12:18.322 --> 12:20.278
after crashing
into the Irish Mob,

12:20.490 --> 12:22.401
not unless they made some kind
of deal.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.233
I didn't make
any kind of deal.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.073
I don't think
you understand.

12:27.289 --> 12:28.870
I don't think
you understand.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.822
The FBI worked long
and hard

12:31.043 --> 12:32.908
to catch the head
of the Irish Mob.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.790
We cut the head off the snake,
but now, for some reason,

12:36.006 --> 12:38.588
the whole operation
has started up again.

12:39.551 --> 12:40.461
You don't know
who's running it now?

12:40.677 --> 12:43.339
No, but we thought,
having Eddie Harp in custody,

12:43.555 --> 12:44.886
he'd be able
to give us a name.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.089
But you pissed all over that,
Deputy Ferguson.

12:47.309 --> 12:49.641
And now Eddie's gone,
along with our best chance

12:49.853 --> 12:52.139
at finding out
who this new mob boss is.

12:59.488 --> 13:00.102
Ferg?

13:03.242 --> 13:04.197
[sighs]

13:09.122 --> 13:10.328
You know,
nobody would blame you

13:10.540 --> 13:12.451
if you made a deal
to save your life.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.668
You really believe
that I took money?

13:17.464 --> 13:21.252
I wouldn't hold it against you
in a situation like that.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.094
They didn't pay me.

13:24.388 --> 13:26.128
And I don't know
why they didn't kill me.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.551
Probably 'cause
I'm a worthless piece of shit

13:28.767 --> 13:29.847
that isn't worth killing.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.727
Why don't you take
a few days off?

13:36.233 --> 13:37.518
Get some rest.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.366
You know,
I remember a number.

13:52.791 --> 13:56.659
328...1204.

13:57.296 --> 13:58.411
It's a D.O.T. number.

13:59.381 --> 14:00.416
Well, that's something.

14:02.426 --> 14:04.462
Any of those faces
come back to you yet?

14:06.430 --> 14:07.294
No.

14:08.890 --> 14:10.016
Okay.

14:11.601 --> 14:15.765
Before you head home,
let's go look into that number.

14:23.989 --> 14:29.825
You can enjoy 401(k) packages,
profit sharing, paid vacations.

14:30.287 --> 14:33.950
And at Four Arrows, uh, there
are advancement opportunities.

14:34.166 --> 14:37.499
Our dealers have become
pit bosses and managers.

14:37.711 --> 14:42.000
And the majority of them
didn't have a college degree.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.127
Maybe best of all,
it's recession-proof.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.460
The casino gaming industry
is one of the fastest-growing

14:48.680 --> 14:51.717
multibillion-dollar industries
in this country.

14:51.933 --> 14:53.594
You can look it up.
So...

14:53.810 --> 14:55.721
[applause]

14:55.896 --> 14:57.511
Anyway, before you leave
the career fair,

14:57.731 --> 14:59.141
you just drop on
by our table there.

14:59.358 --> 15:00.973
We'll set you up with
appHcaﬁons

15:02.611 --> 15:05.569
And, remember,
the lack of a college degree

15:05.781 --> 15:07.863
shouldn't stop you
from going after a lucrative

15:08.075 --> 15:09.611
and fulfilling career.

15:09.826 --> 15:10.941
All right?
[woman] Yeah!

15:11.161 --> 15:12.867
Yeah!
Come on.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.446
[applause]

15:15.665 --> 15:18.077
[indistinct conversations]

15:20.212 --> 15:24.251
So, you're encouraging students
to work at a casino

15:24.466 --> 15:25.546
rather than go to college.

15:26.635 --> 15:30.344
College isn't an option
for most of these kids.

15:31.390 --> 15:33.802
So, uh, why not give them
the option

15:34.017 --> 15:37.100
of getting up close and personal
with the heroin trade

15:37.646 --> 15:38.806
and organized crime?

15:39.898 --> 15:41.138
What are you talking about?

15:41.358 --> 15:45.442
Well, I just arrested
a heroin dealer

15:46.238 --> 15:48.229
who also happens to be
a murderer,

15:48.782 --> 15:50.773
who's connected
to the Irish Mob.

15:51.535 --> 15:52.650
And when my deputy

15:53.412 --> 15:55.573
was transporting him
out of the county,

15:55.789 --> 15:59.077
they were ambushed by gunmen
in an 18-wheeler,

16:00.168 --> 16:01.248
who took my prisoner.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.248
That's quite a story.
What's it have to do with me?

16:04.881 --> 16:07.918
The D.O.T. on the truck
is linked to a travel agency.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.342
You ever heard of a travel
agency that owns 18-wheelers?

16:12.305 --> 16:13.431
No, I haven't.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.471
Well, actually, Jacob,
you have.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.720
Manifest Destinations.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.886
The same travel agency
that books blocks of rooms

16:21.106 --> 16:24.018
at your hotel,
like room 503.

16:24.234 --> 16:28.227
Turns out Manifest Destinations
is a front for the mob...

16:29.239 --> 16:31.025
and their heroin operation.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.482
But you already knew that.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.240
That's why you lied
about it

16:37.456 --> 16:39.242
when we looked into
those rooms earlier.

16:40.542 --> 16:41.577
Oh, okay.

16:42.419 --> 16:43.829
Let me get this straight.

16:44.713 --> 16:47.420
By, uh, your logic,

16:48.049 --> 16:50.756
if an oil executive books
a room in my hotel,

16:50.969 --> 16:53.551
that makes me responsible
for global warming.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.675
I want this murderer,
I want his boss,

16:56.892 --> 16:59.304
and I want his heroin
out of my county.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.474
Dear God, Walt.

17:00.687 --> 17:04.305
Is there no crime anywhere
you won't try to blame on me?

17:05.025 --> 17:07.641
Who do you work with
at Manifest Destinations, Jacob?

17:07.861 --> 17:09.476
And where can I find him?

17:10.530 --> 17:13.863
Well, you know,
I can't answer those questions,

17:14.075 --> 17:15.531
but here are a couple
of questions

17:15.744 --> 17:16.859
and answers I can provide.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.909
Did I invite Manifest
Destinations here?

17:19.122 --> 17:20.783
No, I did not.

17:21.416 --> 17:22.781
Did I know about

17:23.001 --> 17:24.832
or have anything to do with
a heroin operation?

17:25.045 --> 17:26.831
No, I did not.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.580
And if you have
any other baseless accusations

17:29.799 --> 17:31.209
you need to level
against me,

17:31.426 --> 17:33.758
I suggest you save them
for the deposition.

17:43.855 --> 17:45.356
Yeah. Right.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.726
It's a Department
of Transportation I.D.

17:49.528 --> 17:50.392
Uh-huh.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.438
Yeah.

17:59.663 --> 18:01.244
Okay.
Thanks.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.002
I thought Walt gave you
the day off.

18:10.048 --> 18:10.912
He did.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.748
I just didn't know what to do
with myself.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.097
I just talked to the state
police.

18:25.313 --> 18:26.428
There's no sign
of the semi,

18:26.648 --> 18:27.933
so I'm guessing
that they ditched it

18:28.149 --> 18:30.686
and transferred Eddie
into another vehicle.

18:33.154 --> 18:34.280
Should I resign?

18:34.823 --> 18:35.687
What?

18:36.533 --> 18:38.023
I don't deserve
to be here.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.858
I screwed this up.

18:40.078 --> 18:42.569
Ferg, you were mugged,
Wyoming style.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.654
It could have happened
to any one of us.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.661
You did nothing wrong.
Okay?

18:49.838 --> 18:55.003
Walt just has this stupid policy
about transporting prisoners.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.756
If anything screwed this up,
it was that, not you.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.756
You might not want to mention
Walt's stupid policy

19:02.976 --> 19:04.136
at your deposition.

19:07.439 --> 19:08.599
Have you told him?

19:10.525 --> 19:11.560
He's got to know.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.982
I mean, you know,
how could he not know?

19:20.535 --> 19:22.651
[Dave] Thank you for making
the time for this deposition.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.161
I promise it will be quick
and painless.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.750
So, Mr. Nighthorse,

19:28.585 --> 19:30.576
Sheriff Longmire arrested you
for conspiracy

19:30.795 --> 19:32.877
in the attempted murder
of his deputy, Branch Connally?

19:33.465 --> 19:34.329
Yeah.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.837
And when he was unable
to convict you of that charge,

19:38.053 --> 19:39.418
he released you, right?

19:39.638 --> 19:40.798
Not exactly.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.800
-We made a deal first.
-Okay.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.428
But what happened
after you made the deal?

19:46.144 --> 19:47.133
He released me.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.514
And then he shot at you.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.436
[Walt] No.
No, I did not.

19:50.940 --> 19:51.850
Barlow did that.

19:52.067 --> 19:55.184
Says who?
Says you? [chuckles]

19:55.403 --> 19:58.395
Barlow shot at him
right before you shot Barlow.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.401
Well, now. [chuckles]
That is convenient.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.448
[laughs]

20:02.661 --> 20:04.743
Now, Jacob,
I can appreciate

20:04.954 --> 20:07.286
that you don't want to pile on
to the sheriff here,

20:07.499 --> 20:09.706
but everybody knows
that the sheriff isn't a big fan

20:09.918 --> 20:11.158
of your casino.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.494
-Mm.
-Ever since Four Arrows opened,

20:13.713 --> 20:15.374
haven't you been
a constant victim

20:15.590 --> 20:17.672
of aggressive harassment
by his department?

20:17.884 --> 20:22.344
In fact, didn't Sheriff Longmire
accuse you, at gunpoint,

20:22.555 --> 20:24.341
of killing both his deputy
and his wife?

20:24.557 --> 20:28.891
Now, hold on. Tucker, you have
quite a flair for drama.

20:29.104 --> 20:30.685
I'd buy tickets to your show.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.558
But let's get real.

20:32.774 --> 20:35.732
Mr. Nighthorse, you can't really
think Walt is that bad a man.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.147
You must find something
trustworthy in the Longmire name

20:38.363 --> 20:40.570
if you've gone out and hired
his daughter as a lawyer.

20:40.782 --> 20:43.819
I'll tell you why he hired her.
To buy my silence.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.822
He's trying to manipulate me
by recruiting Cady

20:47.038 --> 20:49.950
so I don't take him down
for bringing the mob and heroin

20:50.166 --> 20:52.373
into my county
through his casino.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.086
Gentlemen.
[chuckles]

20:54.295 --> 20:55.831
I do believe
that Sheriff Longmire here

20:56.047 --> 20:59.084
is doing his damndest to try
and intimidate my witness.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.916
So I think it's about time we
took ourselves a little break.

21:02.137 --> 21:04.378
Why don't you go on back
in my study, okay?

21:06.516 --> 21:07.346
Sheriff.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.925
[clears throat, chuckles]

21:13.773 --> 21:16.981
I think --
Could you excuse us a minute?

21:17.193 --> 21:18.148
Thank you.

21:21.740 --> 21:24.982
I-I think we need to find
a middle ground

21:25.201 --> 21:30.241
between not showing up
and...whatever that was.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.539
Look, you took
Tucker's bait.

21:32.751 --> 21:35.163
Losing your temper gives him
ammunition in his case.

21:35.378 --> 21:38.962
Don't dig your
own grave here, Walt.

21:45.555 --> 21:46.180
Huh.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.468
[clicking]

21:49.642 --> 21:52.509
[rock music playing on radio]

21:53.104 --> 21:55.140
Oh, yeah.
You're really good at this.

21:55.356 --> 21:57.733
No, I'm a freakin' superstar
at this.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.855
All right. Come on.
I want to see your skills.

22:02.781 --> 22:03.896
No.
I don't have any.

22:04.783 --> 22:06.774
Well, that's not true.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.497
I'm so proud of you.

22:12.373 --> 22:13.749
Proud?

22:13.958 --> 22:15.118
I failed.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.166
No, you survived.

22:18.213 --> 22:19.794
There could have been
a very different ending

22:20.006 --> 22:23.248
to what happened out there
on that road, but here you are.

22:23.468 --> 22:24.878
You're standing next to me.

22:26.179 --> 22:27.715
I'm really happy
about that.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.057
It happened.

22:30.266 --> 22:31.472
Simple as that.

22:32.352 --> 22:33.842
Now you get to decide
what you're gonna do

22:34.062 --> 22:34.972
about what happened.

22:37.649 --> 22:38.729
Come on.
It's your turn.

22:38.942 --> 22:41.399
Give it a shot.
Come on.

22:41.611 --> 22:42.771
-You sure?
-Mm-hmm.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.693
I mean, I know
you're a superstar,

22:44.906 --> 22:48.194
but I did get a
perfect score of 300

22:48.409 --> 22:50.195
on my last handgun
qualification, so...

22:50.411 --> 22:51.867
All right.
[laughs]

22:52.080 --> 22:54.287
-Can we have two more?
-Mm-hmm.

22:54.499 --> 22:56.581
[Mandy] So I'm not putting up
with that bullshit. I quit.

22:57.669 --> 22:58.624
Thanks.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.582
It's his piece-of-shit car.
He can pay for it himself.

23:03.216 --> 23:04.922
Give me my necklace back!

23:05.134 --> 23:06.965
And you stay the
hell away from us!

23:08.513 --> 23:10.128
-This is mine.
-Oh, you have no clue.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.964
-And J.P. is mine, bitch.
-Hey, hey, hey.
What's the problem over here?

23:13.184 --> 23:14.344
Hey! Hey!

23:14.561 --> 23:16.051
-You and your husband...
-Break it up.

23:16.271 --> 23:18.136
-...are liars and thieves!
-Break it up!

23:18.356 --> 23:19.971
-Break it up!
-Get the hell off me!

23:20.191 --> 23:22.523
-Get this bitch off me!
-Shut up!

23:22.735 --> 23:24.350
You're just jealous
that I'm the one he married!

23:24.571 --> 23:25.811
-So shut the hell up!
-Enough!

23:26.030 --> 23:27.065
Enough!

23:27.866 --> 23:28.901
Get off of me!

23:29.868 --> 23:30.983
Ha!

23:31.202 --> 23:32.282
[grunts]

23:33.079 --> 23:35.570
[music continues]

23:41.462 --> 23:42.747
So, what happened here?

23:42.964 --> 23:44.704
Oh, just a bar fight.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.789
Archie broke it up.

23:49.846 --> 23:50.710
Oh.

23:51.764 --> 23:52.674
Okay.

23:53.975 --> 23:56.091
You seen Henry...Archie?

23:56.311 --> 23:58.176
N Go and get you some J‘J‘

23:58.396 --> 24:01.934
N Go and get you some, uh-huh J‘J‘

24:14.996 --> 24:15.860
[knock on door]

24:16.748 --> 24:19.535
Hey, Henry,
you remember those tourists

24:19.751 --> 24:21.582
you were cooking fish for
the other day?

24:23.963 --> 24:24.952
Come in.

24:25.882 --> 24:27.497
They weren't tourists.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.207
One of them, Eddie Harp,

24:29.427 --> 24:31.668
is a murderer and a drug dealer
with the Irish Mob

24:31.888 --> 24:33.424
who just escaped
from custody.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.757
Don't know who the other guy is,
but, uh, I got to find him.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.467
You, uh -- you remember
seeing them before or since?

24:40.563 --> 24:41.313
No.

24:41.522 --> 24:42.978
You remember anything
about them?

24:43.191 --> 24:45.853
Like, they seem like friends
or colleagues?

24:46.611 --> 24:49.478
The redhead was deferential,
like the other guy was his boss.

24:50.573 --> 24:51.779
And the boss paid.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.402
With a credit card.

24:54.619 --> 24:55.734
You have that receipt?

24:59.457 --> 25:02.415
[rock music playing on radio]

25:03.461 --> 25:05.201
He paid with a corporate
credit card --

25:06.172 --> 25:07.708
Manifest Destinations.

25:08.508 --> 25:11.170
Manifest Destinations
is a sham travel agency.

25:11.386 --> 25:13.422
It's actually a front
for the mob.

25:14.639 --> 25:16.721
Just trying to make out
a signature.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.675
Connor O'Brien.

25:20.478 --> 25:21.593
[Ruby]
Okay. Thanks.

25:22.146 --> 25:23.852
[receiver rattles]
Ferg.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.230
That was the phone company.

25:26.442 --> 25:27.727
They located your phone.

25:27.944 --> 25:29.559
Maybe that will lead us
to Connor O'Brien.

25:29.779 --> 25:31.610
Nope.
Not unless he stood still.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.566
The phone was pinged
on Dahill Road,

25:33.783 --> 25:35.114
right where the Charger
was left.

25:35.326 --> 25:36.361
Thanks.

25:36.995 --> 25:40.328
So, a lab in Cheyenne
lifted a print

25:40.540 --> 25:42.997
from the heroin syringe that was
used to murder Joey Takoda.

25:43.209 --> 25:46.201
Great. So we have Eddie Harp's
fingerprint on the murder weapon

25:46.421 --> 25:48.582
but...not Eddie.

25:49.257 --> 25:50.838
We have Eddie's fingerprints
on file, though.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.166
We can try and match them
to the syringe print.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.217
And when we find Eddie,
we'll have concrete evidence

25:55.430 --> 25:56.636
to convict him.

25:56.848 --> 25:58.463
[Vic]
Hey, Walt, uh,

25:58.683 --> 26:00.093
Eddie was transferred
before we booked him,

26:00.309 --> 26:01.560
so we don't have his prints.

26:04.689 --> 26:05.553
[sighs]

26:05.773 --> 26:09.766
And, uh, Connor O'Brien,
your potential mob boss,

26:10.236 --> 26:12.522
has been dead
for 40 years, so...

26:16.784 --> 26:18.160
Uh, Vic, uh...

26:18.369 --> 26:19.654
Yeah?
[clears throat]

26:21.330 --> 26:22.991
-Where are you going?
-I thought you knew.

26:23.207 --> 26:25.198
I'm -- I'm headed
to your deposition.

26:25.418 --> 26:26.498
Right, right.

26:26.711 --> 26:28.622
Well, uh, no use taking
two cars.

26:28.838 --> 26:29.873
I'll drive you.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.084
Oh, you're gonna go?

26:33.259 --> 26:34.009
Yep.

26:34.635 --> 26:36.136
My lawyer thinks
it's a good idea, so...

26:36.345 --> 26:37.505
Yeah.

26:37.722 --> 26:39.178
It's a good idea.
It's great.

26:47.982 --> 26:49.188
Hey.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.027
Here you go.
The usual.

26:52.236 --> 26:53.737
You can put it on my desk.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.616
[door closes]

27:03.915 --> 27:05.405
So...

27:07.126 --> 27:08.741
Manifest Destinations.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.706
[wood clatters]

27:14.258 --> 27:17.750
Have you found anything
in Malachi's books about them?

27:20.640 --> 27:24.132
Or a reference to someone
named...

27:25.978 --> 27:27.809
...Shane Muldoon?

27:28.022 --> 27:29.558
Who is Shane Muldoon?

27:29.774 --> 27:32.891
That's the person Malachi
might be doing business with.

27:34.695 --> 27:36.822
Jacob, if we are dealing
with the Irish Mob here,

27:37.031 --> 27:38.817
then it is time to talk
to Walt Longmire.

27:39.033 --> 27:40.819
This is getting bigger
than us.

27:42.703 --> 27:45.536
I never mentioned the Irish Mob
to you, Henry.

27:47.708 --> 27:50.620
The name Shane Muldoon
kind of announces itself.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.498
It is not a hard deduction.

27:55.842 --> 27:59.960
Have you already been
talking to Walt?

28:01.222 --> 28:03.383
Because he's suddenly aware
of a connection

28:03.599 --> 28:07.183
between Manifest Destinations
and the Irish Mob.

28:07.395 --> 28:11.138
Makes me wonder...
who told him about it.

28:11.357 --> 28:12.597
You should ask him.

28:13.609 --> 28:18.774
How much have you shared
with Walt about our deal?

28:19.699 --> 28:20.529
Nothing.

28:20.867 --> 28:23.153
And do we still have a deal?

28:24.453 --> 28:26.239
I find it strange

28:26.998 --> 28:31.458
you found those fake
Red Pony ledgers so fast...

28:32.211 --> 28:35.123
...and yet you haven't been able
to locate Malachi's real books

28:35.339 --> 28:36.328
for weeks.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.915
l have been a
little busy lately.

28:39.135 --> 28:41.342
My life is not my own
anymore.

28:41.554 --> 28:44.717
I have too many puppet masters
pulling my strings.

28:44.932 --> 28:49.517
Believe me, I would like
nothing more than to have my bar

28:49.729 --> 28:52.846
and my independence
and my dignity back.

29:02.491 --> 29:03.150
[door closes]

29:03.784 --> 29:06.321
[Vic] Ever since Walt hired me,
I've only ever known him

29:06.537 --> 29:09.654
to be ethical, honorable,
and effective.

29:10.124 --> 29:11.239
Thank you,
Deputy Moretti.

29:11.459 --> 29:14.166
You said
ever since Walt hired you.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.251
Now, Ms. Moretti,
could you talk to us

29:16.464 --> 29:18.750
about being hired
by Sheriff Longmire?

29:18.966 --> 29:21.173
About how you were evaluated.

29:21.385 --> 29:22.841
Oh, yeah.
Um, I was --

29:23.054 --> 29:25.170
Because Monte,
my private investigator,

29:25.389 --> 29:27.721
he tells me that Sheriff
Longmire's hiring practices

29:27.934 --> 29:31.392
can be quite, um,
well, original.

29:33.856 --> 29:35.141
Can I speak now or...

29:35.358 --> 29:37.144
Oh, yes.
Why, please do.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.608
I don't know about original.

29:39.820 --> 29:42.948
I find him to be thoughtful
and observant.

29:43.157 --> 29:44.863
Did he ask you
about why you left Philadelphia?

29:45.409 --> 29:47.240
-No.
-ReaHy?

29:47.453 --> 29:49.535
He didn't ask you
about the scandal

29:49.747 --> 29:51.078
surrounding your dismissal?

29:52.375 --> 29:53.410
No.

29:53.626 --> 29:57.369
Well, that's probably because
he found you to be unhirable,

29:57.588 --> 29:59.579
an outcast,
desperate for a job

29:59.799 --> 30:02.165
and willing to do anything
he wanted.

30:02.385 --> 30:05.752
And in exchange,
he'd give you your badge back.

30:07.056 --> 30:09.092
[clears throat]
That's not who Walt is.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.593
Well, how would
you know?

30:10.810 --> 30:13.267
Walt Longmire is a very
secretive man, it seems.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.640
At least that's what your
colleague, Deputy Ferguson,

30:15.856 --> 30:17.357
-to|d Monte.
-Okay.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.648
Just so you know,
I blew the whistle on a cop

30:19.860 --> 30:21.111
-who was breaking the law.
-Mm-hmm.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.026
I'm not exactly
the type of person

30:23.239 --> 30:25.230
that a corrupt sheriff
would want to keep around.

30:26.284 --> 30:27.114
Jesus.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.702
Now, excuse me, young lady,

30:28.911 --> 30:31.197
but there's no need
for such coarse language.

30:32.915 --> 30:34.451
Are we done here?

30:34.667 --> 30:35.827
I do believe we are.

30:40.423 --> 30:44.587
Although...l do have
just one more question.

30:44.802 --> 30:47.009
You're kidding me. You're --
You're pulling a Columbo?

30:47.221 --> 30:48.802
[laughs]

30:49.015 --> 30:53.224
Ms. Moretti, uh,
did you recently get divorced?

30:53.436 --> 30:54.926
Now, wait a second.
Objection.

30:55.146 --> 30:56.886
Her personal life has nothing
to do with any of this.

30:57.106 --> 31:00.849
Well, you're probably right,
but I-I just got to ask.

31:04.113 --> 31:05.649
You serious?
I got to answer his question?

31:05.865 --> 31:07.730
-You objected.
-Yeah, but that's
just for the record.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.156
You still have to answer.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.574
I can try to get it
disallowed in court.

31:11.203 --> 31:11.908
[clears throat]

31:14.123 --> 31:14.908
Yeah.

31:15.541 --> 31:16.781
I recently got divorced.

31:17.543 --> 31:20.626
And did your recent divorce
have anything to do

31:20.838 --> 31:25.753
with your relationship
with the ethical Walt Longmire?

31:30.181 --> 31:32.046
So, can you explain to us

31:32.266 --> 31:37.681
why, um, somebody
at the Durant Regional Hospital

31:37.897 --> 31:40.980
recently reported
that you and the sheriff were...

31:41.192 --> 31:42.227
[clears throat]

31:42.443 --> 31:45.355
..."locked in a
passionate kiss"?

31:58.459 --> 31:59.824
I'm sorry.

32:01.545 --> 32:06.790
That, uh...didn't go the way
that I expected it to.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.339
It's fine.

32:12.807 --> 32:15.048
If it wasn't that,
it'd have been something else.

32:16.060 --> 32:18.802
If they're willing
to misconstrue an entire career,

32:19.814 --> 32:23.398
they're not gonna have a problem
misconstruing a...moment.

32:25.027 --> 32:27.689
Meantime, nobody's tending
to the county.

32:28.447 --> 32:32.565
As long as I still have a job,
we need to find this murderer

32:32.785 --> 32:34.366
and the head
of the Irish Mob.

32:35.704 --> 32:37.240
You do everything you can

32:37.456 --> 32:39.287
to find out
about Manifest Destinations.

32:40.793 --> 32:42.078
I'll do the same.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.127
By the way,

32:50.261 --> 32:54.129
if you were unhirable,
I wouldn't have hired you.

33:07.695 --> 33:09.686
[engine shuts off]

33:14.034 --> 33:15.820
-We've got to get her
out of here.
-Who?

33:16.036 --> 33:17.651
-The bitch who stole my shit.
-She came in your house?

33:17.872 --> 33:19.408
No. She lives here.
Come on.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.123
She's in here.

33:24.003 --> 33:25.118
Come on!
Hurry up!

33:26.172 --> 33:26.831
Hey.

33:28.841 --> 33:30.251
Oh, my God. We need to call
an ambulance now.

33:30.468 --> 33:32.254
No, no, no.
She's totally breathing.

33:32.470 --> 33:34.301
I-I threw cold water on her,
and I slapped her up.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.014
We just got to get her in --
in your car, okay?

33:36.223 --> 33:37.929
-No, we need to get her
to a hospital.
-No.

33:38.142 --> 33:39.882
If we take her to the hospital,
they're gonna call the cops.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.343
The cops are gonna come along
and think that I did this shit.

33:44.064 --> 33:45.224
Why would they think
you did this?

33:45.399 --> 33:46.935
Maybe it's because
I broke in here

33:47.151 --> 33:48.891
to get my necklace back
after this knocked-out bitch

33:49.111 --> 33:50.191
yanked it off my neck
yesterday

33:50.362 --> 33:52.023
in a bar fight
that everybody saw.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.029
Come on.

33:55.242 --> 33:56.027
Mandy.

33:56.243 --> 33:57.358
Wake up.

33:57.578 --> 33:58.488
-Wake up.
-Hey, Mandy.

33:58.704 --> 33:59.659
What?

33:59.872 --> 34:01.032
Did you do this?

34:03.167 --> 34:05.078
No.
No, I did not.

34:05.294 --> 34:06.534
But this is what I'm trying to
tell you

34:06.754 --> 34:08.244
is that I'm gonna take the blame
for it

34:08.464 --> 34:10.955
when it was her asshole husband
who did this shit.

34:11.509 --> 34:12.498
He did it.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.583
This was all him.
Trust me. I know.

34:14.803 --> 34:17.510
So we got to get her out of here
before he comes back.

34:17.723 --> 34:18.758
You got to help me.

34:18.974 --> 34:20.680
Come on!
Help me!

34:20.893 --> 34:23.350
Come on!
Don't just stand there!

34:30.194 --> 34:31.684
[engine shuts off]

34:51.549 --> 34:53.961
[chucang]
It is a nice costume.

34:55.844 --> 34:56.879
Ferguson.

35:02.518 --> 35:04.054
[badge rattles]

35:36.677 --> 35:37.883
[elevator bell chimes]

35:41.849 --> 35:43.055
[knock on door]

35:45.728 --> 35:47.810
You need to
invite me in -- now.

35:49.106 --> 35:50.312
I don't think
that's a good idea.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.859
Tom, it's a very good idea.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.445
Another idea
is that I call your wife.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.152
What the hell?

36:04.121 --> 36:07.864
Uh, there's a, um,
FBI agent in my office.

36:08.626 --> 36:10.617
Be very interested
in what's going on here.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.499
I never saw you, Tom.

36:24.475 --> 36:25.681
Are you dressed?

36:26.727 --> 36:27.933
[Shawna] Yes.

36:32.191 --> 36:33.772
So we know
you're not a travel agent,

36:33.984 --> 36:35.975
so let's start over
with the truth,

36:36.195 --> 36:37.401
if you don't want me
to turn you in.

36:38.364 --> 36:40.320
Who do you deal with
here at the casino?

36:41.158 --> 36:42.113
Different people.

36:42.951 --> 36:43.861
Him?

36:44.578 --> 36:46.910
I've seen him on
the floor, but no.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.786
Where are you from?

36:49.291 --> 36:50.201
Boston.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.290
Were you a prostitute
in Boston?

36:52.711 --> 36:56.203
No. I was a waitress at The
Shamrock and Plough for years.

36:56.423 --> 36:57.833
What made you come here?

36:58.050 --> 37:00.166
The bartender there,
actually.

37:00.386 --> 37:01.717
He approached me

37:01.929 --> 37:04.170
and said that the owner
wanted me to come to Wyoming.

37:04.390 --> 37:07.803
Said I'd make five times what I
made at The Shamrock and Plough,

37:08.018 --> 37:09.098
and he was right.

37:09.311 --> 37:11.472
-Who's the owner?
-Connor O'Brien.

37:12.523 --> 37:14.138
Can you tell me
what he looks like?

37:14.650 --> 37:17.483
No. I've never
seen the guy.

37:19.947 --> 37:22.734
You should probably come to the
clinic for some X-rays.

37:24.785 --> 37:26.400
I think you might have
a broken rib.

37:27.830 --> 37:30.993
Asha, do you want
to press charges?

37:31.208 --> 37:32.163
Against her?

37:33.252 --> 37:34.958
Me? Why would you press charges
against me?

37:35.170 --> 37:36.706
I'm the one who saved
your stupid ass.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.128
What were you doing
in my house?

37:38.882 --> 37:41.919
Cady and l were walking by,
and we heard a fight.

37:42.136 --> 37:44.297
And then we saw
that asshole leave.

37:44.513 --> 37:45.719
I saw that nasty look
in his eyes,

37:45.931 --> 37:47.512
and I knew
something was wrong.

37:49.351 --> 37:51.342
Cady didn't want to go in,
but I knew we had to.

37:51.562 --> 37:54.053
And then I found you --
out cold.

37:54.273 --> 37:55.763
Do you want to call
the police?

37:55.983 --> 37:58.645
[scoffs]
Call the police.

37:59.111 --> 38:01.318
You know, the first
time J.P. beat me,

38:01.530 --> 38:02.690
he called the police.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.316
Yeah, that's right.

38:04.533 --> 38:07.149
He called the tribal police
to report himself,

38:07.327 --> 38:08.487
just to rub it in my face

38:08.704 --> 38:10.365
that there's nothing
they could do about it.

38:10.581 --> 38:11.821
He's white.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.576
When was the first time
that he beat you?

38:15.377 --> 38:16.241
Last year.

38:17.171 --> 38:18.411
Well, the law's changed
since then.

38:19.256 --> 38:20.291
Now the tribal police

38:20.507 --> 38:23.249
can arrest a white guy
for abusing a Native woman,

38:23.469 --> 38:26.051
as long as the woman is his wife
or girlfriend.

38:26.263 --> 38:28.754
I didn't know that.
Somebody should tell people.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.430
Asha, you got to put him in jail.
You got to make him pay --

38:30.642 --> 38:33.258
I don't want him in jail.
I just want him to stop.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.720
If he goes to jail, he's
just gonna come back angrier.

38:35.939 --> 38:38.146
He's gonna walk right back
through that door and he's --

38:38.358 --> 38:39.643
Bitch, don't you get it?

38:39.860 --> 38:41.521
You have to leave him.

38:42.154 --> 38:44.736
I may not like you,
but I hate him.

38:45.282 --> 38:46.738
And I know
you hate him, too.

38:47.117 --> 38:49.699
And trust me -- I got a lot
on my plate, and feeling guilty

38:49.912 --> 38:52.619
when you show up dead is not
something that I want to add.

38:58.378 --> 38:59.083
Okay.

38:59.296 --> 39:00.832
I'll do whatever you want.

39:01.799 --> 39:03.505
I just don't want him in jail.

39:05.636 --> 39:06.967
And I want to be safe.

39:07.179 --> 39:08.840
I think there's a way
we can do that.

39:15.103 --> 39:17.435
Manifest Destinations
doesn't have a website

39:18.232 --> 39:19.938
or a single Yelp review.

39:22.152 --> 39:26.191
So, uh...
how did the deposition go?

39:26.406 --> 39:27.942
Not great.

39:29.451 --> 39:35.321
Well, these things always have
a way...of working out.

39:37.793 --> 39:39.329
You've had a turnaround.

39:39.962 --> 39:41.327
What are you doing
over there?

39:41.547 --> 39:43.629
Well, you know
how we couldn't compare

39:43.841 --> 39:47.049
the fingerprint on the syringe
with Eddie Harp's fingerprints

39:47.261 --> 39:48.171
'cause we didn't have them?

39:50.472 --> 39:52.053
Now we do.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.433
[Ferg]
Eddie Harp's file.

40:04.653 --> 40:06.314
My deputy lifted
one of Eddie Harp's fingerprints

40:06.530 --> 40:07.610
from his badge.

40:07.823 --> 40:09.939
Eddie grabbed it
during the ambush.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.898
I matched the print
from my badge

40:12.119 --> 40:14.906
to the heroin syringe that Eddie
used as the murder weapon.

40:15.622 --> 40:18.785
So while you were here gambling,
we were solving a murder

40:19.001 --> 40:22.038
that gives you serious leverage
to use against Eddie Harp

40:22.254 --> 40:23.369
should you catch him.

40:24.214 --> 40:26.375
Probably enough
to get him to give up the name

40:26.592 --> 40:29.174
of the mystery man who's running
heroin and prostitution

40:29.386 --> 40:30.922
right out of this casino.

40:32.556 --> 40:33.671
And one more thing.

40:34.892 --> 40:37.349
There's no way that anyone from
the mob would have known,

40:37.561 --> 40:38.550
through my office,

40:38.770 --> 40:41.182
that we had custody
of Eddie Harp

40:41.398 --> 40:43.104
or that we were
transporting him.

40:43.317 --> 40:45.228
I never gave Eddie
a phone call.

40:45.444 --> 40:47.355
So you may just want to check
your own house,

40:47.571 --> 40:49.107
see if you got a leak.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.446
Good day, sir.

41:11.470 --> 41:13.586
Well, better late than
never, I guess.

41:13.805 --> 41:14.840
Yeah.

41:15.057 --> 41:16.137
-Sorry.
-Are you?

41:16.350 --> 41:18.136
Uh, I feel like
you're not.

41:18.352 --> 41:20.308
Who's the second witness
that Tucker added?

41:25.943 --> 41:28.355
You know what he's gonna say,
I assume.

41:29.738 --> 41:30.568
Yep.

41:31.490 --> 41:32.525
Is it true?

41:33.533 --> 41:34.613
It's complicated.

41:37.079 --> 41:38.865
Nice of you to join us.

41:39.081 --> 41:40.696
We were just getting ready
to pack it up.

41:42.376 --> 41:44.913
You know, Counselor,
it seems a little much to keep

41:45.128 --> 41:47.039
my witness waiting, seeing as
how he came all the way --

41:47.255 --> 41:48.085
Tucken

41:50.676 --> 41:52.632
I prefer the sheriff didn't know
where I lived.

41:53.762 --> 41:56.344
He's got a nasty habit
of tracking me down

41:56.556 --> 42:00.265
and shooting me
or assaulting me.

42:00.477 --> 42:02.638
Well, since you're in
such a hurry,

42:02.854 --> 42:06.096
why don't we just
get right to it?

42:06.316 --> 42:07.305
Sheriff.

42:07.526 --> 42:09.232
So.
[clears throat]

42:09.444 --> 42:11.935
Mr. Browning,
I've read your statement.

42:12.155 --> 42:15.363
But isn't it true that when you
had your run-in with the sheriff

42:15.575 --> 42:17.076
out there in those woods,

42:17.285 --> 42:21.028
you were actually hunting down
a girl named Gabriella Langton?

42:21.248 --> 42:22.408
You were gonna kill her

42:22.582 --> 42:23.958
so she couldn't charge
your men with rape.

42:24.167 --> 42:26.954
Walt shot at you
strictly out of self-defense.

42:27.170 --> 42:28.706
Isn't that
what really happened?

42:28.922 --> 42:32.085
Sounds like you, uh,
you haven't read my statement.

42:32.300 --> 42:37.135
I was out in those woods hiking
with my friend, Trot Simic.

42:37.347 --> 42:39.053
-With guns.
-Yeah, with guns.

42:39.266 --> 42:41.848
It's grizzly country.
It's dangerous up there.

42:42.060 --> 42:45.552
And then on our hike,
the sheriff ambushed us,

42:47.107 --> 42:50.349
had my friend shot and killed,
nearly killed me.

42:51.361 --> 42:53.067
Bet you're wishing
you would've finished me off

42:53.280 --> 42:55.020
when you had the chance,
huh, Sheriff?

42:56.074 --> 42:58.156
He's lying under oath.

42:58.368 --> 43:01.405
[Tucker] Mr. Browning
has received impeccable reviews

43:01.621 --> 43:02.872
from his employers.

43:03.081 --> 43:04.821
He's revered by his peers.

43:05.667 --> 43:06.702
And he maintains his cool

43:06.918 --> 43:09.751
in the presence of somebody
who tried to kill him --

43:09.963 --> 43:13.205
not once, but twice, apparently.

43:14.051 --> 43:16.633
Seems to me
to be a reliable witness.

43:17.387 --> 43:19.764
Truth is I have just as many
people willing to attest

43:19.973 --> 43:21.429
to his good character

43:21.641 --> 43:23.472
as I have people
willing to testify

43:23.685 --> 43:25.141
to your questionable character.

43:25.353 --> 43:26.388
I'm leaving.

43:27.189 --> 43:29.475
-This is bullshit.
-Well, just for the record,

43:29.691 --> 43:31.932
I think I have
an alternate explanation

43:34.029 --> 43:37.692
Rather than be offended
by the aforementioned bullshit,

43:37.908 --> 43:40.194
it could be that the sheriff
has to face the fact

43:40.410 --> 43:43.152
that I found another victim
who was shot at,

43:43.371 --> 43:44.872
without any witnesses,

43:45.082 --> 43:47.994
simply because the sheriff
couldn't make his charges stick.

43:49.252 --> 43:50.992
The exact same pattern
of behavior

43:51.213 --> 43:54.671
that led to the tragic death
of my client, Barlow Connally.

43:56.885 --> 43:58.876
Oh, but now listen to me go on.

44:00.263 --> 44:02.640
This is your deposition,
ain't it, Counselor?

44:02.849 --> 44:04.134
Hmm?

44:04.309 --> 44:07.142
Please, fire away.

44:09.898 --> 44:10.648
Henry.

44:12.275 --> 44:14.891
[rock music playing on radio]

44:21.493 --> 44:23.279
I just brought you one
30 seconds ago.

44:23.495 --> 44:24.735
What is going on?

44:36.758 --> 44:37.918
Yeah.

44:38.135 --> 44:39.124
[chuckles]

44:39.344 --> 44:41.585
You know,
I'm in all this trouble

44:41.805 --> 44:44.842
for trying to do
my job well, and...

44:46.643 --> 44:48.099
and I have to ask myself --

44:48.311 --> 44:52.179
Am I actually doing my
job well with the --

44:53.233 --> 44:57.272
with the mob bringing
prostitutes and murderers

44:57.487 --> 45:01.400
and...heroin into my county?

45:03.076 --> 45:06.443
Then when I think I've found
the guy that's behind it,

45:06.663 --> 45:09.120
turns out the guy's been using
a fake name.

45:09.332 --> 45:13.621
Connor O'Brien has been
dead for 40 years.

45:14.629 --> 45:15.914
Rest in peace.

45:21.428 --> 45:22.759
What if I have
the real name?

45:25.307 --> 45:26.513
Shane Muldoon.

45:30.854 --> 45:33.220
-How do you know that?
-I cannot say.

45:34.107 --> 45:35.347
Well, I'll ask you again.

45:36.234 --> 45:37.519
How do you know that?

45:37.736 --> 45:39.397
Wait, I wanted to help you.
Now I have.

45:39.613 --> 45:41.149
-I do not want --
-Henry.

45:42.532 --> 45:44.568
What have you
gotten yourself into?

45:45.535 --> 45:47.400
Who gave you the name
Shane Muldoon?

45:54.169 --> 45:55.454
Nighthorse.

45:56.504 --> 46:00.668
So Nighthorse has a relationship
with this guy,

46:00.884 --> 46:02.169
the head of the Irish Mob.

46:02.385 --> 46:04.250
Malachi may be more crooked here
than Nighthorse.

46:04.429 --> 46:06.670
Nighthorse hired Malachi.

46:06.890 --> 46:08.972
Whatever Malachi does
is on Nighthorse.

46:09.184 --> 46:10.094
He's got to know.

46:10.310 --> 46:11.925
You know the one thing
I've learned

46:12.145 --> 46:13.681
through all these
depositions?

46:14.356 --> 46:17.473
If you're at the top,
you're held responsible.

46:18.443 --> 46:19.944
Nighthorse is going down.

46:20.153 --> 46:21.563
You cannot
bring him down yet.

46:23.198 --> 46:24.153
Why not?

46:26.201 --> 46:28.783
He promised
to get me my bar back.

46:31.665 --> 46:32.905
Oh, Henry.

46:35.085 --> 46:36.416
Please.

46:39.756 --> 46:41.337
Well, I can't wait long.

46:42.425 --> 46:44.040
You figure it out fast.

46:51.893 --> 46:53.554
Moving forward,
we need to be sure

46:53.770 --> 46:55.726
all the witnesses we call
have detailed accounts --

46:55.939 --> 46:57.145
Dave.

46:57.357 --> 46:58.221
Yeah?

46:58.441 --> 46:59.692
This civil suit

46:59.901 --> 47:03.109
is not about whether or not
I did the right thing.

47:03.321 --> 47:07.405
It's... It's about
negotiating lies.

47:07.617 --> 47:09.403
I don't know how to play
that game.

47:10.954 --> 47:11.989
I want to settle.

47:13.373 --> 47:17.207
Walt, don't be thrown
by these depositions.

47:17.419 --> 47:19.831
I mean, Tucker Baggett
just delayed those witnesses

47:20.046 --> 47:22.423
to put pressure on you
so that you would settle.

47:22.632 --> 47:24.793
You're the one who told me to
settle in the first place, Dave.

47:25.010 --> 47:26.750
Well, that was
before I saw Tucker's game.

47:26.970 --> 47:29.131
I-I can't stand
his good-old-boy bullying.

47:29.973 --> 47:31.929
Walt, I'm very good
at what I do.

47:32.142 --> 47:34.053
And now that I see
how this is gonna be played,

47:34.269 --> 47:35.554
I think we
should keep fighting.

47:35.770 --> 47:38.386
-I think we can win.
-I don't care about winning.

47:39.190 --> 47:41.681
I care about being able
to get back to doing my job.

47:42.694 --> 47:44.309
This lawsuit
is a restraining order

47:44.529 --> 47:46.770
that's keeping me
from being effective.

47:46.990 --> 47:48.480
We can do this
and get you back --

47:48.700 --> 47:51.783
These people did not elect me
to protect myself, Dave.

47:51.995 --> 47:53.610
I'm here to protect them.

47:53.830 --> 47:57.118
Right now, heroin is pouring
into my county,

47:57.334 --> 47:59.120
a murderer is on the loose,

47:59.336 --> 48:01.497
and a mob boss
thinks he can move in.

48:02.297 --> 48:03.457
I have work to do.

48:05.008 --> 48:07.545
If that's
what you really want.

48:08.219 --> 48:09.345
It is.

48:09.554 --> 48:10.839
All right then.

48:12.015 --> 48:15.223
Well, you're insured
by Absaroka County for $250,000.

48:15.935 --> 48:18.472
That's $250,000 more

48:18.688 --> 48:20.804
than the Barlow Connally estate
deserves, but...

48:22.692 --> 48:24.193
...so be it.

48:24.402 --> 48:25.733
-Dave.
-Yeah?

48:30.450 --> 48:32.065
Thanks,bud.

48:38.666 --> 48:39.917
[door closes]

49:00.146 --> 49:02.011
[sighs]

49:02.232 --> 49:03.938
[footsteps approaching]

49:04.150 --> 49:06.061
[knock, door opens]

49:06.778 --> 49:07.642
Hey.

49:08.822 --> 49:10.687
So, I've scoured
the whole damn World Wide Web,

49:10.907 --> 49:13.114
and there is nothing
on Manifest Destinations,

49:13.326 --> 49:14.611
so I did
a Google Street View

49:14.828 --> 49:16.614
of the address
that matches the credit card,

49:16.830 --> 49:19.492
and it's just a vacant lot
and a bar.

49:19.666 --> 49:21.827
[sniffs, sighs]

49:26.214 --> 49:27.624
Uh...

49:32.303 --> 49:34.840
Tell Ruby I'm gonna take
the next couple of days off.

49:42.355 --> 49:44.812
[telephone rings]

49:47.444 --> 49:48.854
Hey, Punk.

49:49.070 --> 49:51.527
Dad. Hi.
I have a favor to ask you.

49:51.739 --> 49:53.445
[laughs]
What's that?

49:53.658 --> 49:55.944
You want to come and deliver
a restraining order with me?

49:56.161 --> 49:58.026
There's a white guy
who lives on the res, and he --

49:58.246 --> 49:59.702
-Why do you need me?
-I think it --

49:59.914 --> 50:02.075
it might have more impact
coming from a sheriff.

50:03.501 --> 50:05.833
Well, I have a
better idea, Cady.

50:06.045 --> 50:07.296
You should quit.

50:09.424 --> 50:10.459
Dad, come on.

50:11.092 --> 50:13.674
You know, you can run errands
for Nighthorse.

50:13.887 --> 50:14.967
I won't.

50:15.180 --> 50:17.512
I'm really trying to
help people here.

50:17.724 --> 50:19.715
You do know you're being paid
with dirty money.

50:20.602 --> 50:23.264
Money from drugs
and prostitution.

50:23.480 --> 50:26.187
Wow. Those are some pretty big
accusations.

50:26.357 --> 50:27.813
Do you have any proof
of that?

50:28.026 --> 50:29.266
Spoken like a true lawyer.

50:29.486 --> 50:30.771
Listen, uh,
I'll talk to you later.

50:30.987 --> 50:32.488
l have something
I have to do.

50:33.656 --> 50:34.406
[telephone beeps]

50:37.744 --> 50:38.494
[telephone beeps]

50:56.513 --> 51:01.598
l have some news which I'm sure
you'll be happy to hear.

51:01.809 --> 51:03.310
What's that, Counselor?

51:04.187 --> 51:08.897
My client, Walt Longmire,
wants to settle.

51:09.108 --> 51:11.144
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah, it dawned on Walt

51:11.361 --> 51:13.602
what a pain in the ass
this Iawsuit's gonna be.

51:13.821 --> 51:15.322
It's not worth his time.

51:15.532 --> 51:18.319
You want maximized value
for the estate you represent,

51:18.535 --> 51:20.491
and Walt just wants
to get back to work.

51:20.703 --> 51:22.989
-What number were you thinking?
-$250,000.

51:24.040 --> 51:26.122
[chuckles] That's exactly
what the county's covered for

51:26.334 --> 51:28.495
-under their insurance policy.
-Right.

51:28.711 --> 51:29.917
Everybody wins.

51:30.129 --> 51:33.087
So I'll draft the paperwork
and get --

51:33.299 --> 51:34.414
Don't bother.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.170
Pardon?
You heard me.

51:37.387 --> 51:38.547
I said don't bother.

51:39.222 --> 51:41.838
Walt Longmire's not concerned
about the hassle.

51:42.058 --> 51:43.764
He's concerned about losing.

51:43.977 --> 51:46.719
And now you both understand
the case that I have,

51:46.938 --> 51:49.554
you both understand
that I can get a lot more money.

51:50.650 --> 51:52.140
So the settlement's
off the table.

51:53.236 --> 51:55.943
The good people of Absaroka
deserve to hear this evidence

51:56.155 --> 51:58.817
in court,
and the citizens of this county

51:59.450 --> 52:01.657
deserve to know what kind
of sheriff they elected.

52:01.869 --> 52:03.700
And when they do,
they're gonna realize

52:03.913 --> 52:05.449
that poor Barlow Connally

52:05.665 --> 52:09.658
deserves a hell of a lot more
than $250,000.

52:10.837 --> 52:14.204
So if you'll excuse me,
Counselor, I need to practice.

52:42.243 --> 52:43.699
[horn honks in distance]

52:45.788 --> 52:48.575
[indistinct conversations]

52:53.421 --> 52:55.753
[siren wailing in distance]

52:59.886 --> 53:02.844
[rock music playing on radio]

53:03.056 --> 53:05.593
N You got a whole lot of nerve
now J‘J‘

53:05.808 --> 53:08.641
N You got to open up your eyes J‘J‘

53:08.853 --> 53:10.434
J‘J‘ And in case
you haven't heard J‘J‘

53:10.647 --> 53:14.515
J‘J‘ Well, here's a word
to the wise J‘J‘

53:14.734 --> 53:16.850
J‘J‘ Don't get on my bad side J‘J‘

53:17.070 --> 53:19.732
J‘J‘ Don't want to find out why If

53:19.906 --> 53:22.943
J‘J‘ Don't get on my bad side J‘J‘

53:29.874 --> 53:31.159
Brought you these fish.

53:32.543 --> 53:35.785
Now there's no reason for you
to come back to Absaroka.

53:37.507 --> 53:41.045
I'm gonna be very polite
but very clear.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.176
I want you out of my county.

53:45.098 --> 53:46.338
I know who you are.

53:46.557 --> 53:48.548
The FBI does not.

53:48.768 --> 53:50.053
Not yet.

53:50.937 --> 53:54.179
You came all the way across
the country to threaten me?

53:54.399 --> 53:55.229
No.

53:56.109 --> 53:57.645
No, I came to help you.

53:58.194 --> 54:00.025
I'm giving you a heads-up.

54:00.238 --> 54:01.774
I just gave the FBI evidence

54:01.989 --> 54:05.948
that connects your man,
Eddie Harp, to a murder.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.445
If they catch him,

54:07.662 --> 54:09.448
what do you think
Eddie's gonna choose?

54:09.664 --> 54:12.997
Life sentence for murder
or a deal from the feds?

54:13.209 --> 54:17.043
Your name in exchange
for protective custody.

54:17.255 --> 54:19.371
I'm sure you already know
that Eddie's quite a talker.

54:19.590 --> 54:21.091
Are you telling me
to kill him?

54:21.300 --> 54:23.427
I don't tell people
how to run their business.

54:25.555 --> 54:27.546
I'm just trying to help you
stay out of prison.

54:29.559 --> 54:36.055
I also strongly encourage you
and your drugs

54:36.899 --> 54:41.017
and your prostitutes
to stay out of my county.

54:42.029 --> 54:46.693
If you don't,
I'll tell the FBI who you are.

54:46.909 --> 54:48.285
What makes you think
I won't kill you

54:48.494 --> 54:52.078
in the middle of the night,
Sheriff Longmire?

54:52.290 --> 54:53.746
Others have tried.

54:55.585 --> 54:56.700
Look me up.

54:57.754 --> 54:59.836
You'll find I have
quite a reputation.

55:08.014 --> 55:09.094
I know he has a gun.

55:10.683 --> 55:13.675
Before you signal him
to kill me, know this --

55:13.895 --> 55:16.682
if I don't come home,
I've left instructions

55:16.898 --> 55:19.514
for my deputy to give
an envelope to the FBI.

55:20.735 --> 55:21.975
It's got your name in it.

55:23.571 --> 55:25.311
Shane Muldoon.

55:30.077 --> 55:32.784
ls Absaroka County really worth
your time?

55:35.208 --> 55:36.414
And your life?

55:40.755 --> 55:42.040
Enjoy the fish.
