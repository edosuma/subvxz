Give me the bill.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.177
Hello.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.578
So, I was just going
through our bill,

19:07.580 --> 19:11.082
and we will not be paying
any of your hidden fees.

19:11.084 --> 19:13.985
Ma'am, you can't choose
what part you pay.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.453
Yes, I can.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.255
Tell them
what happened, baby.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.125
I was running
by the pool

19:21.127 --> 19:23.094
'cause there's no lifeguard
on duty.

19:23.096 --> 19:26.164
And no posted signage.
And no posted signage.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.532
And I fell.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.201
And my tooth was knocked
out of my head.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.602
[ Gasps ]
Oh, my God.

19:31.604 --> 19:36.174
Your bill didn't include
my child-disfigurement fee.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.944
And that's
how<i> I</i> get<i> you.</i>

19:41.014 --> 19:44.515
Oh, we also have AAA,
so it's another 10% off.

19:44.517 --> 19:48.219
I can't believe you got
the hotel charges reduced.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.021
You are
on a different level.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.223
Good job, my baby.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.791
Thanks, mommy.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.860
The baby is back.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.229
Was that true? Did you
really fall by the pool
and lose your tooth?

19:58.231 --> 20:00.731
No. Mom ripped it out
with her hands.

20:00.733 --> 20:01.899

20:16.382 --> 20:19.584
I died,

Aw, hell no!

20:22.222 --> 20:23.988
[ Screaming continues ]

20:28.561 --> 20:30.161
So, we were cliff-diving
off the coast

20:30.163 --> 20:32.163
when I saw them in the water --
sharks.

20:32.165 --> 20:33.197
I grabbed my harpoon --

20:33.199 --> 20:35.499
dude, that's, like,
a baby tooth.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.168
What? No.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.070
It's a tooth
from a hammerhead shark.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.671
They're smaller
a-and flatter.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.106
More like
a "babyhead" shark.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.843
[ Sighs ]
Okay, fine.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.345
I didn't do anything
this summer

20:47.347 --> 20:49.046
except for sit around
and play video games.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.449
That's cool.
Nicole?

20:51.451 --> 20:52.450
What are you
doing here?

20:52.452 --> 20:54.285
I have to repeat
the 8th grade.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.387
Partied too much with my mom
and blew off summer school.

20:56.389 --> 20:57.822
Wish I'd done nothing
like you.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.125
You know this kid?

21:01.127 --> 21:02.426
Yeah, he's my friend.

21:04.731 --> 21:08.199
You just chilled at home.
I like it.

21:09.202 --> 21:11.135

21:17.243 --> 21:19.744
No, what -- no.
It's...
