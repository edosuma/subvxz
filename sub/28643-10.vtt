1:03:35.259 --> 1:03:37.054
- And I was just really
impressed with Luke today.

1:03:37.089 --> 1:03:39.988
- What is up?
- [laughs]

1:03:40.023 --> 1:03:41.541
I was like, "Whoa.
Like,

1:03:41.576 --> 1:03:44.234
this is the guy that
I've been waiting for."

1:03:44.268 --> 1:03:46.581
How are you?
- How are you doing?

1:03:46.615 --> 1:03:49.446
He knows without a doubt
that he is in love with me,

1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:52.311
and he wants me to be his wife
one day and can see that.

1:03:52.345 --> 1:03:53.864
- Oh, look at this.

1:03:53.899 --> 1:03:55.417
- I know.

1:03:55.452 --> 1:03:56.936
- Oh, this is darling.

1:03:56.971 --> 1:03:59.766
- And I feel like we're
starting to turn the page

1:03:59.801 --> 1:04:02.769
and enter into a new chapter
of our relationship.

1:04:02.804 --> 1:04:04.910
Um, I had so much fun today.

1:04:04.944 --> 1:04:06.049
- That makes me so happy.

1:04:06.083 --> 1:04:07.774
- Yeah.
- Seriously, like,

1:04:07.809 --> 1:04:09.673
I am honored
that you chose me...

1:04:09.707 --> 1:04:11.778
- Mm-hmm.
- To go on the date

1:04:11.813 --> 1:04:15.299
that checks off another one of
your bucket list locations.

1:04:15.334 --> 1:04:18.233
That's--that's a big deal.
- Yeah.

1:04:18.268 --> 1:04:20.373
- You get so cute.
Whenever I start talking about

1:04:20.408 --> 1:04:21.616
my feelings for you,

1:04:21.650 --> 1:04:23.790
you, like, start
inching a little closer,

1:04:23.825 --> 1:04:25.447
and you have,
like, laser focus.

1:04:25.482 --> 1:04:28.243
Seriously, it's--
it's so attractive.

1:04:28.278 --> 1:04:29.486
It made me feel really good.

1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:31.005
- Well, I'ma make a toast.

1:04:31.039 --> 1:04:32.972
- Yes.

1:04:33.007 --> 1:04:39.289
- Cheers to a beautiful day
in Santorini.

1:04:39.323 --> 1:04:40.531
- Mm.

1:04:40.566 --> 1:04:44.466
- And being at this place
in our relationship

1:04:44.501 --> 1:04:47.538
and where we've come from
to where we are now.

1:04:47.573 --> 1:04:49.299
- Yes.
- Cheers.

1:04:49.333 --> 1:04:50.541
- I'll cheers to that.
[glasses clink]

1:04:53.303 --> 1:04:57.824
No, you're not lying.
Today was absolutely beautiful.

1:04:57.859 --> 1:05:00.344
- Mm-hmm.
- But I'll say this.

1:05:00.379 --> 1:05:02.415
'Cause you know,
there are things

1:05:02.450 --> 1:05:03.900
that I do want to
talk to you about.

1:05:03.934 --> 1:05:05.902
- Mm-hmm.
- We're talking about marriage.

1:05:05.936 --> 1:05:07.282
This is--this is a huge deal.

1:05:07.317 --> 1:05:08.939
- Yeah.
- And,

1:05:08.974 --> 1:05:11.114
you know, forever
shouldn't be taken lightly.

1:05:11.148 --> 1:05:12.218
- Yeah.

1:05:12.253 --> 1:05:14.669
- And there's
so many things that,

1:05:14.703 --> 1:05:17.983
you know, I want for myself

1:05:18.017 --> 1:05:19.674
in my future wife,
my future...

1:05:19.708 --> 1:05:21.676
- Mm-hmm.
- That, you know,

1:05:21.710 --> 1:05:24.921
I want it the way I want it,
you know what I mean?

1:05:24.955 --> 1:05:26.198
- Yeah.

1:05:26.232 --> 1:05:29.856
- You brought up something
on hometowns, like,

1:05:29.891 --> 1:05:32.135
you've been a spiritual leader
in your household.

1:05:32.169 --> 1:05:33.136
- Uh-huh.
- That's something

1:05:33.170 --> 1:05:34.413
that I can totally relate to.

1:05:34.447 --> 1:05:36.380
I have been a spiritual leader
in my household.

1:05:36.415 --> 1:05:38.037
You know how that is.
- Mm-hmm.

1:05:38.072 --> 1:05:39.866
- It's not the easiest
all the time.

1:05:39.901 --> 1:05:45.182
- Mm-hmm.
- But I'm so ready to, like,

1:05:45.217 --> 1:05:47.426
make history in my family.

1:05:47.460 --> 1:05:49.186
I want to make sure
that from now on,

1:05:49.221 --> 1:05:51.948
things are known
how they're supposed to be.

1:05:51.982 --> 1:05:54.053
So let's talk about sex.
- Okay.

1:05:54.088 --> 1:05:55.813
- Um...

1:05:55.848 --> 1:05:58.713
You know,
sex is an incredible thing.

1:05:58.747 --> 1:06:01.888
- Mm-hmm.
- And it's a beautiful thing.

1:06:01.923 --> 1:06:05.720
Well, only, you know,
when it's in the--

1:06:05.754 --> 1:06:07.549
within the guidelines
of marriage.

1:06:07.584 --> 1:06:10.449
This whole process,
I've been studying Hebrews,

1:06:10.483 --> 1:06:14.177
and talks about how marriage
should be honored by everybody

1:06:14.211 --> 1:06:16.903
and how the marriage bed
should be kept pure.

1:06:16.938 --> 1:06:18.491
I know you're not a virgin.
- Mm-hmm.

1:06:18.526 --> 1:06:20.907
- We've had the talk.
You know I'm not.

1:06:20.942 --> 1:06:22.909
I've been abstaining myself
from sex

1:06:22.944 --> 1:06:24.842
for, like,
3 1/2 to 4 years now...

1:06:24.877 --> 1:06:26.430
- Mm-hmm.
- And I know that

1:06:26.465 --> 1:06:28.570
regardless of
what I've done in the past,

1:06:28.605 --> 1:06:31.228
I am saving myself
for marriage.

1:06:31.263 --> 1:06:36.061
And, you know,
I am very confident

1:06:36.095 --> 1:06:40.410
that we're on the same page
with, you know, our morals.

1:06:40.444 --> 1:06:43.137
And I just--I want to
hear it from your mouth.

1:06:43.171 --> 1:06:45.967
You know, like, there's
a lot of people that say

1:06:46.002 --> 1:06:47.865
they believe in some things
but yet, like,

1:06:47.900 --> 1:06:50.523
they live or do things
completely differently.

1:06:50.558 --> 1:06:51.662
- Mm-hmm.

1:06:51.697 --> 1:06:54.079
- And thinking about
Fantasy Suites,

1:06:54.113 --> 1:06:56.771
like, I've heard people
proclaim their faith

1:06:56.805 --> 1:06:58.669
but yet they've said things
like, you know,

1:06:58.704 --> 1:07:00.430
"I'm excited
for Fantasy Suites.

1:07:00.464 --> 1:07:02.604
"I want to explore
this relationship

1:07:02.639 --> 1:07:04.779
"on a sexually intimate level,

1:07:04.813 --> 1:07:08.231
and that's what
I'm looking forward to."

1:07:08.265 --> 1:07:10.336
And, to me, that's, like,
"Whoa, what?"

1:07:10.371 --> 1:07:12.235
- Mm-hmm.
- "Excuse me?"

1:07:12.269 --> 1:07:14.478
There's something
I'm missing here.

1:07:14.513 --> 1:07:16.377
Like, I don't believe
that's something

1:07:16.411 --> 1:07:17.792
that you should be doing.

1:07:17.826 --> 1:07:21.968
And I just want to make sure
you're not going to be,

1:07:22.003 --> 1:07:25.662
you know, sexually intimate
with, you know,

1:07:25.696 --> 1:07:28.182
the other relationships here.

1:07:28.216 --> 1:07:29.700
- Okay.

1:07:29.735 --> 1:07:31.840
- Like, I totally have all
the trust in the world for you.

1:07:31.875 --> 1:07:33.118
But at the same time,

1:07:33.152 --> 1:07:35.120
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

1:07:35.154 --> 1:07:36.293
Like, if I--I mean, if I--

1:07:36.328 --> 1:07:37.984
if you told me
you're having sex

1:07:38.019 --> 1:07:42.368
or you had sex with
one or multiple of these guys,

1:07:42.403 --> 1:07:44.474
I'd be wanting to go home.
- Mm-hmm.

1:07:44.508 --> 1:07:45.923
- 100%.
- Mm-hmm.

1:07:45.958 --> 1:07:48.098
- But if that's something
you're not going through,

1:07:48.133 --> 1:07:49.824
then I'm just gonna continue

1:07:49.858 --> 1:07:53.483
to grow the relationship
and move on.

1:07:53.517 --> 1:07:54.898
- Um...

1:07:57.866 --> 1:08:01.111
Like, sex is
a very big deal to me.

1:08:01.146 --> 1:08:05.495
And I've said,
like, I've had sex

1:08:05.529 --> 1:08:07.186
with two people in my life.

1:08:07.221 --> 1:08:09.326
And it was long relationships

1:08:09.361 --> 1:08:13.019
I thought were gonna be
my husband.

1:08:13.054 --> 1:08:15.194
But some of the things
that you said,

1:08:15.229 --> 1:08:18.301
like, I don't agree with
at all.

1:08:18.335 --> 1:08:23.271
And honestly, like,

1:08:23.306 --> 1:08:25.342
I'm, like, kind of mad,

1:08:25.377 --> 1:08:28.621
because, like,

1:08:28.656 --> 1:08:32.108
the way that
you just said that is like,

1:08:32.142 --> 1:08:33.695
why do you
have the right to do that?

1:08:33.730 --> 1:08:36.871
Because you're not my husband.
And you're not--

1:08:36.905 --> 1:08:38.044
- Can I cut you off
for a second?

1:08:38.079 --> 1:08:39.391
- No.
- Okay.

1:08:39.425 --> 1:08:41.462
- It's just that you're--
that you're questioning me,

1:08:41.496 --> 1:08:43.188
that you're judging me
and feel like

1:08:43.222 --> 1:08:47.088
you have the right to
when you don't at this point.

1:08:48.503 --> 1:08:52.852
And I get when you,
like, care for somebody

1:08:52.887 --> 1:08:55.027
that you don't want to
think about somebody

1:08:55.061 --> 1:08:57.961
being intimate with
another person, but guess what.

1:08:57.995 --> 1:08:59.273
Sex might be a sin out of
marriage;

1:08:59.307 --> 1:09:01.067
pride is a sin too.

1:09:01.102 --> 1:09:03.863
And I feel like this is
like a pride thing.

1:09:03.898 --> 1:09:05.900
- So...

1:09:05.934 --> 1:09:07.626
[sighs]

1:09:09.248 --> 1:09:12.527
I do want to take a step back
to things I have said already.

1:09:12.562 --> 1:09:16.566
And I want you to know that...

1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:19.914
just reassessing
what I've told you, like,

1:09:19.948 --> 1:09:22.227
Hannah...

1:09:22.261 --> 1:09:24.574
I don't take it lightly when
I tell you that I love you.

1:09:28.129 --> 1:09:30.442
Let's say I am the last date.

1:09:30.476 --> 1:09:33.583
And let's say
you have had sex--

1:09:33.617 --> 1:09:34.929
throwing a crazy scenario
at you--

1:09:34.963 --> 1:09:36.033
let's say you've had sex

1:09:36.068 --> 1:09:38.174
with all these
other relationships.

1:09:38.208 --> 1:09:39.796
All of 'em.

1:09:41.142 --> 1:09:44.283
I--I'm willing to do or work
through anything.

1:09:44.318 --> 1:09:45.388
You're right.

1:09:45.422 --> 1:09:46.872
I don't have the right
to ask you that,

1:09:46.906 --> 1:09:48.322
but to me, I just want to know
what's going on, because--

1:09:48.356 --> 1:09:50.116
- But you did, and--
- You're right.

1:09:50.151 --> 1:09:51.463
Because of the trust.
- Let me talk!

1:09:51.497 --> 1:09:52.843
You did--
- You got the floor.

1:09:52.878 --> 1:09:54.914
- You did ask.

1:09:54.949 --> 1:09:56.606
And the words
that you just used were

1:09:56.640 --> 1:09:59.367
will--You're "willing
to work through this."

1:10:01.300 --> 1:10:03.613
I'm a grown woman
and can make my own decisions.

1:10:03.647 --> 1:10:05.960
And I don't--I'm not
strapped to a man right now.

1:10:05.994 --> 1:10:06.961
Like--

1:10:06.995 --> 1:10:08.790
- See... [laughs]
Uh...

1:10:08.825 --> 1:10:10.378
I don't want to get into the--

1:10:10.413 --> 1:10:12.622
being misconstrued
and being misunderstood

1:10:12.656 --> 1:10:13.968
thing again.

1:10:14.002 --> 1:10:15.556
'Cause this happened a lot

1:10:15.590 --> 1:10:16.798
with me
throughout this process.

1:10:16.833 --> 1:10:18.835
- No, it's what you said.
- You're right, but,

1:10:18.869 --> 1:10:21.355
to me, okay, like,

1:10:21.389 --> 1:10:24.047
just being real, like--
- Yeah, be real.

1:10:24.081 --> 1:10:26.636
- I can understand
a slip-up.

1:10:26.670 --> 1:10:28.914
But, like, with all of 'em?

1:10:28.948 --> 1:10:30.743
I mean, that's kind of where
I was going with that.

1:10:30.778 --> 1:10:32.400
If, like, you were just like,
"You know what?

1:10:32.435 --> 1:10:33.470
"I want to just
have sex with everyone

1:10:33.505 --> 1:10:35.817
and see what it's like,"

1:10:35.852 --> 1:10:37.992
then, yeah, I would be like,

1:10:38.026 --> 1:10:39.821
"Okay...
I'ma talk to you,

1:10:39.856 --> 1:10:41.409
but you know what?
Like, I'm out of here."

1:10:41.444 --> 1:10:42.652
- So what would that--
- But if you had, like--

1:10:42.686 --> 1:10:43.825
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:10:43.860 --> 1:10:46.483
Honestly, like,
what you're saying,

1:10:46.518 --> 1:10:51.005
the words that you're saying
are just like really not okay.

1:10:51.039 --> 1:10:52.869
They're just not okay.

1:10:52.903 --> 1:10:57.391
And the closest thing
that I've ever felt to...

1:10:57.425 --> 1:11:00.325
love at first sight
was probably with you.

1:11:00.359 --> 1:11:05.675
And our relationship,
from the beginning,

1:11:05.709 --> 1:11:09.057
gave me so much hope

1:11:09.092 --> 1:11:13.130
and then it was like,
all this [bleep]...

1:11:13.165 --> 1:11:15.685
- Yeah.
- Kept happening.

1:11:15.719 --> 1:11:18.204
And honestly, like,
you have already

1:11:18.239 --> 1:11:21.277
broken my heart through this,
like, truly.

1:11:21.311 --> 1:11:24.038
And I have broken
my own heart

1:11:24.072 --> 1:11:27.041
'cause I've allowed everything.

1:11:27.075 --> 1:11:29.215
And...

1:11:29.250 --> 1:11:34.151
to ignore all the red flags
for how I feel,

1:11:34.186 --> 1:11:37.879
to have this

1:11:37.914 --> 1:11:40.365
and to have you
say this about me

1:11:40.399 --> 1:11:43.057
and make me feel like I--

1:11:43.091 --> 1:11:46.716
you would look at me
any differently and judge me

1:11:46.750 --> 1:11:51.893
or make me feel like
you would not

1:11:51.928 --> 1:11:54.448
think of me
as a woman of faith like I am

1:11:54.482 --> 1:11:56.346
and that we weren't
on the same page,

1:11:56.381 --> 1:11:57.382

1:22:15.516 --> 1:22:16.932
This isn't over for me yet.

1:22:16.966 --> 1:22:18.761
This is my heart
we're talking about here.

1:22:18.795 --> 1:22:20.418
- It's--
this is not about your heart.

1:22:20.452 --> 1:22:21.660
[bleep]--leave!

1:22:21.695 --> 1:22:22.834
- Why are you still here?

1:22:22.868 --> 1:22:23.904
- She said no.

1:22:23.939 --> 1:22:25.354
How many more "no's"
do you need?

1:22:25.388 --> 1:22:27.011
- Lay your hands off me.

1:22:27.045 --> 1:22:28.184
- Or what?

1:22:28.219 --> 1:22:30.083
- Yeah, what are you gonna do?

1:22:30.117 --> 1:22:32.085
- And then...

1:22:32.119 --> 1:22:33.949
- ♪ All the other dudes
got me feeling so spressed ♪

1:22:33.983 --> 1:22:36.296
♪ So I say all aboard,
hotness express ♪

1:22:36.330 --> 1:22:37.642
Oh!
[crowd cheers]

1:22:37.676 --> 1:22:39.437
- It's a very special
"Men Tell All"...

1:22:39.471 --> 1:22:41.715
- You can honestly just go
[bleep] yourself, dude.

1:22:41.749 --> 1:22:44.580
- When all the guys you've
loved this season return...

1:22:44.614 --> 1:22:46.133
- Your story has changed.

1:22:46.168 --> 1:22:48.308
- What did you say, dude?
Just what did you say?

1:22:48.342 --> 1:22:50.862
- Including the guys
you love to hate.

1:22:52.139 --> 1:22:53.623
- You're violent.
You're aggressive.

1:22:53.658 --> 1:22:55.280
You are a psychopath.

1:22:55.315 --> 1:22:58.249
- Karma is a bitch,
and you're gonna get yours.

1:22:59.422 --> 1:23:00.976
- What will Luke do now?

1:23:01.010 --> 1:23:02.978
- I've already given you
a piece of my heart.

1:23:03.012 --> 1:23:05.290
But I hope in the future,

1:23:05.325 --> 1:23:07.465
I can give you all of it.

1:23:07.499 --> 1:23:09.018
- Find out next week.

1:23:09.605 --> 1:23:11.883
And then, in two weeks...

1:23:11.917 --> 1:23:13.747
- [bleep] me.

1:23:13.781 --> 1:23:16.750
This is why you don't date
two people at the same time.

1:23:16.784 --> 1:23:19.339
- It's an unbelievable
season finale...

1:23:19.373 --> 1:23:20.857
- I can tell you have concerns.

1:23:20.892 --> 1:23:22.238
So just--
will you just say 'em?

1:23:22.273 --> 1:23:24.033
- When Hannah
faces the decision

1:23:24.068 --> 1:23:25.724
that will change her life.

1:23:25.759 --> 1:23:27.416
- This is really [bleep] up.

1:23:27.450 --> 1:23:29.935
Now I'm freaking out.

1:23:29.970 --> 1:23:31.799
- I want somebody
that will love you

1:23:31.834 --> 1:23:33.836
like I know
you should be loved.

1:23:33.870 --> 1:23:37.736
[dramatic music intensifies]

1:23:37.771 --> 1:23:40.739
- It's all coming up
on "The Bachelorette."

1:23:41.257 --> 1:23:42.948
- Fruit and chocolate cake,

1:23:42.983 --> 1:23:44.398
Fantasy Suite with my girl:

1:23:44.433 --> 1:23:46.090
Does it get any better
than this?

1:23:46.124 --> 1:23:47.953
- Mmm.
- I don't think so.

1:23:47.988 --> 1:23:50.232
All right, let's see
if we got any better.

1:23:50.266 --> 1:23:51.612
- Oh, okay.
- You ready for this?

1:23:51.647 --> 1:23:54.788
All right, three, two, one.

1:23:54.822 --> 1:23:56.617
- [grunts]
- Oh, I thought we got it.

1:23:56.652 --> 1:23:57.756
- I thought we did too.
- It, like, disappeared.

1:23:57.791 --> 1:23:59.896
- Okay. Go again.
- All right, ready?

1:23:59.931 --> 1:24:01.450
Two.

1:24:01.484 --> 1:24:03.348
- God--
Peter, that was in my hair.

1:24:03.383 --> 1:24:04.349
That was not--
- That was not in your hair.

1:24:04.384 --> 1:24:05.419
- That was like right here.

1:24:05.454 --> 1:24:06.558
- You're putting this
on me now?

1:24:06.593 --> 1:24:07.939
Okay.
- I'm, like, over here.

1:24:07.973 --> 1:24:09.492
Get into the light.

1:24:09.527 --> 1:24:11.563
We gotta get this.
This is making me mad.

1:24:11.598 --> 1:24:12.702
- I know.
[laughs]

1:24:13.669 --> 1:24:15.119
- [bleep]!
- That was not my fault.

1:24:15.153 --> 1:24:17.293
- Okay, do it again.
- [mimics plane droning]

1:24:17.328 --> 1:24:18.812
- No, I want to--
I gotta get it.

1:24:18.846 --> 1:24:20.400
- Three, two...

1:24:20.434 --> 1:24:21.470
- Peter!
- It's--

1:24:21.504 --> 1:24:22.816
you try throwing it.
Look--

1:24:22.850 --> 1:24:25.094
look how it gets stuck
with the chocolate.

1:24:25.129 --> 1:24:26.130
- [laughs]
- See?

1:24:26.164 --> 1:24:27.476
It, like, veers off.

1:24:27.510 --> 1:24:29.271
You can't put it straight.
- Let me try it again.

1:24:29.305 --> 1:24:30.651
- We're gonna be here all
night.

1:24:30.686 --> 1:24:33.413
- I will not go upstairs
unless--

1:24:33.447 --> 1:24:35.139
- Until we get this
in the mouth.

1:24:35.173 --> 1:24:36.657
- [gasps]

1:24:36.692 --> 1:24:38.556
That one was--
- Hannah.

1:24:38.590 --> 1:24:39.626
You put it in my shirt.
- [laughs]

1:24:39.660 --> 1:24:41.041
- How did--
how did you do that?
