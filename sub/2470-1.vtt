04:42.443 --> 04:43.375
Good night, Pat.

04:43.444 --> 04:44.638
Good night.

04:47.448 --> 04:50.383
What happened to the old bank?
It was beautiful.

04:50.451 --> 04:51.884
People kept robbing it.

04:51.953 --> 04:54.786
That's a small price to pay
for beauty.

05:01.029 --> 05:02.053
Hit me.

05:06.401 --> 05:07.629
Again.

05:11.005 --> 05:11.937
Bust!

05:13.007 --> 05:15.441
Give me credit,
Mr. Macon?

05:15.510 --> 05:18.536
You know my rules, Tom.

05:20.415 --> 05:23.350
Well, it looks like
you just about

05:23.418 --> 05:24.851
cleaned everybody out,
fella.

05:24.919 --> 05:27.854
You haven't lost a hand
since you got the deal.

05:27.922 --> 05:30.356
What's the secret
of your success?

05:33.428 --> 05:34.360
Prayer.

05:35.863 --> 05:37.854
Let's just
you and me play.

05:54.949 --> 05:56.007
Hit it.

06:00.888 --> 06:01.946
Bust.

06:05.126 --> 06:08.562
Yeah, you're a hell of
a card player, fella.

06:08.629 --> 06:12.565
I know, 'cause I'm
a hell of a card player,

06:12.633 --> 06:16.034
and I can't even spot
how you're cheating.

06:29.750 --> 06:32.082
The money stays,
and you go.

06:34.922 --> 06:36.355
Well, we seem to be

06:36.424 --> 06:38.358
a little short
on brotherly love

06:38.426 --> 06:39.552
around here.

06:39.627 --> 06:42.357
If you're with him,
you better get out of here.

06:42.430 --> 06:43.863
We're on our way.

06:43.930 --> 06:45.363
I wasn't cheating.

06:45.432 --> 06:46.364
Come on.

06:46.433 --> 06:47.866
I wasn't cheating!

06:47.934 --> 06:50.368
You can die.
You can both die.

06:50.437 --> 06:51.870
You hear that?

06:51.938 --> 06:54.873
If he invites us
to stay, then we'll go.

06:54.941 --> 06:57.375
He's got to invite us
to stick around.

06:58.445 --> 06:59.878
He'll draw on you.

06:59.946 --> 07:02.506
You don't know
how fast he is.

07:10.390 --> 07:13.325
I'm over the hill,
but it can happen to you.

07:13.393 --> 07:15.827
That's just
what I want to hear.

07:15.896 --> 07:18.330
Every day you get older.
That's a law.

07:27.908 --> 07:29.341
What would you think about

07:29.409 --> 07:31.843
maybe asking us
to stick around?

07:31.912 --> 07:32.879
What?

07:32.946 --> 07:35.346
You don't have to mean it
or anything.

07:35.415 --> 07:37.849
Just ask us to stick around.
I promise...

07:45.425 --> 07:47.359
I can't help you,
Sundance.

07:58.638 --> 08:01.072
I didn't know you were
the Sundance Kid

08:01.141 --> 08:03.006
when I said
you were cheating.

08:05.745 --> 08:08.680
I draw on you,
you'll kill me.

08:08.748 --> 08:11.216
There's that
possibility.

08:12.385 --> 08:13.818
You'd be killing yourself.

08:13.887 --> 08:17.288
Why don't you just invite us
to stick around?

08:19.459 --> 08:20.892
You can do it...

08:20.961 --> 08:22.394
and easy.

08:22.462 --> 08:24.623
Come on.

08:27.532 --> 08:29.432
Come on.

08:30.402 --> 08:32.461
Why don't you
stick around?

08:32.537 --> 08:35.631
Thanks, but we
got to get going.

08:42.380 --> 08:43.438
Hey, Kid.

08:43.515 --> 08:46.279
Hey, Kid,
how good are you?

08:57.929 --> 08:59.863
Like I been
telling you...

08:59.931 --> 09:01.193
over the hill.

09:56.921 --> 09:58.183
Boy, you know,

09:58.256 --> 10:00.349
every time I see
Hole-In-The-Wall,

10:00.425 --> 10:02.859
it's like seeing it
for the first time.

10:02.927 --> 10:05.862
Every time, I ask myself
the same question...

10:05.930 --> 10:10.094
how can I be so damn stupid
to keep coming back?

10:16.441 --> 10:18.375
What's your idea
this time?

10:18.443 --> 10:19.569
Bolivia.

10:22.180 --> 10:23.112
What's Bolivia?

10:23.181 --> 10:25.877
Bolivia... that's
a country, stupid.

10:25.950 --> 10:27.383
Central or
South America.

10:27.452 --> 10:29.477
One or the other.

10:29.554 --> 10:31.488
Let's go to Mexico
instead.

10:31.556 --> 10:33.990
All they got in Mexico
is sweat.

10:34.058 --> 10:35.992
There's too much
of that here.

10:36.060 --> 10:39.996
If we'd been in business
during the California gold rush,

10:40.064 --> 10:42.498
where would we have gone?
California, right?

10:42.567 --> 10:45.195
When I say Bolivia,
you just think California.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.703
You wouldn't believe
what they're finding

10:47.771 --> 10:49.705
in the ground down there.

10:49.773 --> 10:51.206
They're just
falling into it.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.709
Silver mines,
gold mines, tin mines.

10:53.777 --> 10:57.713
Payrolls so heavy we'd strain
ourselves stealing them.

11:00.317 --> 11:02.182
You just keep thinking,
Butch.

11:02.252 --> 11:04.186
That's what you're good at.

11:04.254 --> 11:05.687
Boy, I got vision,

11:05.756 --> 11:08.691
and the rest of the world
wears bifocals.

11:30.447 --> 11:32.278
Hi, News.
What you doing?

11:32.349 --> 11:36.843
Aw, howdy, Butch.
Uh, nothing.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.353
Nothing.

11:38.422 --> 11:39.753
Howdy, Sundance.

11:39.823 --> 11:41.757
You sure are. You're
doing something. What?

11:44.828 --> 11:47.763
<i>Just fixing to rob
the Union Pacific Flyer, Butch,</i>

11:47.831 --> 11:50.959
like what we had in mind.

11:51.034 --> 11:55.437
You fellas got everything
I told you all wrong.

11:55.505 --> 11:57.598
<i>Sure, we might
hit the Flyer,</i>

11:57.674 --> 12:00.609
but even if we do,
it won't be this run.

12:00.677 --> 12:03.043
It'll be the next one,
the return.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.547
Sundance and me,
we been checking the banks.

12:05.616 --> 12:06.640
No banks.

12:06.717 --> 12:07.706
What?

12:08.785 --> 12:10.275
<i>The Flyer, Butch.</i>

12:12.322 --> 12:15.257
Fellas, bad as they are,
banks are better than trains.

12:15.325 --> 12:17.259
They don't move.
They stay put.

12:17.327 --> 12:19.261
You know
the money's in there.

12:19.329 --> 12:20.990
When I left,
I gave orders.

12:21.064 --> 12:22.998
New orders
been given.

12:23.066 --> 12:25.000
I run things here,
Harvey.

12:25.068 --> 12:27.002
Used to you did.

12:27.070 --> 12:28.662
Me now.

12:30.707 --> 12:32.072
This don't concern you.

12:34.678 --> 12:36.771
You tell him
to stay out.

12:36.847 --> 12:39.509
Well, he goes his own way,
like always.

12:39.583 --> 12:41.517
What's the matter
with you guys?

12:41.585 --> 12:43.018
When I came here,

12:43.086 --> 12:45.020
you were nothing.
I formed you.

12:45.088 --> 12:46.020
Who says?

12:46.089 --> 12:48.023
Read them
a clipping, News.

12:48.091 --> 12:49.023
Which one?

12:49.092 --> 12:50.320
Any of them.

12:55.899 --> 12:58.834
<i>This one here's
from Salt Lake Herald.</i>

12:58.902 --> 13:01.132
"Butch Cassidy's
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang..."

13:01.204 --> 13:02.193
That's me!

13:02.272 --> 13:04.706
You want Harvey
to do your planning?

13:04.775 --> 13:07.710
Want him to do your
thinking for you?

13:07.778 --> 13:09.712
You want him
to run things?

13:09.780 --> 13:11.611
Shut up now, News.

13:11.682 --> 13:14.116
Not till I get
to the good part.

13:14.184 --> 13:16.618
"Also known to have
participated in the holdup

13:16.687 --> 13:19.121
are Flat Nose Curry
and News Carver."

13:19.189 --> 13:22.454
I just love to read my name
in the paper, Butch.

13:22.526 --> 13:25.461
So we just forget
about Logan taking over,

13:25.529 --> 13:26.655
OK, Flat Nose?

13:26.730 --> 13:28.163
You always said

13:28.231 --> 13:30.358
that any one of us
could challenge you.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.868
'Cause I figured
no one would do it.

13:32.936 --> 13:34.301
Figured wrong, Butch.

13:34.371 --> 13:36.532
You guys
can't want Logan!

13:38.241 --> 13:40.175
At least
he's with us.

13:40.243 --> 13:42.677
You been spending
a lot of time gone.

13:42.746 --> 13:44.680
Well, that's because
everything's different now.

13:44.748 --> 13:46.181
Guns or knives, Butch?

13:46.249 --> 13:48.683
You got to plan more,
prepare more.

13:48.752 --> 13:50.083
Guns or knives?

13:50.153 --> 13:51.051
Neither.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.110
Pick!

13:52.189 --> 13:55.386
I don't want to shoot
with you, Harvey.

13:55.459 --> 13:57.791
Anything you say, Butch.

14:13.677 --> 14:18.341
Maybe there's a way
to make a profit in this.

14:18.415 --> 14:19.939
Bet on Logan.

14:20.016 --> 14:22.951
I would,
but who'd bet on you?

14:23.019 --> 14:24.179
Sundance...

14:25.422 --> 14:28.357
when we're done
and he's dead,

14:28.425 --> 14:30.689
you're welcome to stay.

14:30.761 --> 14:33.195
I don't mean to be
a sore loser,

14:33.263 --> 14:36.096
but when it's done,
if I'm dead, kill him.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.565
Love to.

14:46.943 --> 14:48.376
No, no. Not yet.

14:48.445 --> 14:50.207
Not until me and Harvey

14:50.279 --> 14:51.974
get the rules
straightened out.

14:52.047 --> 14:54.379
Rules in a knife fight?

14:54.450 --> 14:56.281
No rules.

14:56.352 --> 14:58.820
If there ain't any rules,
let's get started.

14:58.888 --> 15:00.753
Someone count
1, 2, 3, go.

15:00.823 --> 15:01.721
1, 2, 3, go.

15:05.861 --> 15:08.796
I was really rooting
for you, Butch.

15:08.864 --> 15:10.593
Well, thank you,
Flat Nose.

15:10.666 --> 15:13.999
That's what sustained me
in my time of trouble.

15:15.404 --> 15:17.838
<i>Hey, what's this
about the Flyer?</i>

15:17.907 --> 15:19.340
Harvey said we'd hit it

15:19.408 --> 15:21.342
both this run
and the return.

15:21.410 --> 15:23.844
<i>Nobody's done that
to the Flyer before.</i>

15:23.913 --> 15:26.347
No matter how much
we got at first,

15:26.415 --> 15:28.610
they'd figure
the return was safe

15:28.684 --> 15:30.345
and load it up
with money.

15:30.419 --> 15:31.852
Harvey thought of that?

15:31.921 --> 15:33.354
Yes, sir, he did.

15:33.422 --> 15:35.356
I'll tell you something,
fellas.

15:35.424 --> 15:37.915
That's exactly what
we're going to do.

16:14.863 --> 16:15.887
Stop it.

16:15.964 --> 16:17.795
Where?

16:17.866 --> 16:20.300
Up ahead there.

16:20.369 --> 16:22.462
Bet that's old Butch
himself.

16:29.878 --> 16:31.345
Hold it there.

16:32.915 --> 16:34.348
Just thought I'd watch.

16:34.416 --> 16:36.850
Bring the kids,
why don't you?

16:36.919 --> 16:38.352
Stick your heads in.

16:38.420 --> 16:41.878
You're just going to
get yourself blown up

16:41.957 --> 16:43.891
you don't open
that door.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.894
I can't do that.
I work for Mr. E.H. Harriman

16:46.962 --> 16:48.896
of the Union Pacific
Railroad. He...

16:48.964 --> 16:50.898
Shut up about
that E.H. Harriman stuff

16:50.966 --> 16:51.898
and open up.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.400
What's going on?

16:53.469 --> 16:55.403
We got a patriot
in there.

16:55.471 --> 16:57.405
That's young Woodcock.
He's awful dedicated.

16:57.473 --> 16:58.405
Woodcock?

16:58.474 --> 16:59.406
Yes, sir.

16:59.475 --> 17:01.602
You know who we are?

17:01.677 --> 17:04.612
You're the Hole-In-The-Wall
Gang, Mr. Cassidy.

17:04.680 --> 17:06.113
I understand that,

17:06.181 --> 17:10.174
but Mr. E.H. Harriman
himself give me this job.

17:10.252 --> 17:12.185
I got to do my best.

17:12.253 --> 17:14.688
Your best don't include
getting yourself killed.

17:14.757 --> 17:15.815
Dynamite's ready.

17:15.891 --> 17:18.189
Mr. E.H. Harriman himself
had the confidence...

17:18.260 --> 17:20.523
Open the door,
or that's it.

17:20.596 --> 17:22.029
You think
E.H. Harriman

17:22.097 --> 17:24.327
would get himself
killed for you,

17:24.398 --> 17:25.525
Woodcock?

17:25.601 --> 17:28.035
I work
for Mr. E.H. Harriman

17:28.103 --> 17:30.037
of the Union Pacific
Railroad,

17:30.105 --> 17:31.663
and he entrusted me...

17:47.422 --> 17:48.354
Hey, Woodcock.

17:48.423 --> 17:50.357
Woodcock,
you all right?

17:50.425 --> 17:51.858
Hey.

17:51.927 --> 17:53.588
Hmm?

17:58.433 --> 18:01.197
Whatever Harriman's
paying you ain't enough.

18:10.379 --> 18:13.314
There ain't what I'd call
a fortune in there, Butch.

18:13.382 --> 18:15.816
Well, just so
we come out ahead.

18:15.884 --> 18:17.545
That's the main thing.

18:17.619 --> 18:18.800
The Hole-In-The-Wall Gang

18:18.835 --> 18:19.981
The Hole-In-The-Wall Gang

18:20.055 --> 18:24.014
<i>just robbed the Flyer
right outside of our town,</i>

18:24.092 --> 18:26.526
so that makes it
our responsibility

18:26.595 --> 18:29.120
to get out there
and get after them.

18:29.198 --> 18:31.632
You'll have to bring
your own horses.

18:31.700 --> 18:34.863
How many of you
can bring your own guns?

18:37.906 --> 18:42.172
How many of you will want me
to supply you with guns?

18:46.415 --> 18:47.541
Well... come on now.

18:47.616 --> 18:50.847
I think it's up to us
to do something, don't you?

18:50.919 --> 18:52.511
What's the point?

18:52.587 --> 18:53.849
They're probably
halfway

18:53.921 --> 18:55.513
to Hole-In-The-Wall
already.

18:55.590 --> 18:58.024
That's exactly
why we have got to hurry.

18:58.092 --> 19:00.026
If we mount up
right now

19:00.094 --> 19:01.959
and get out there
after them,

19:02.029 --> 19:03.963
maybe we can head them off.

19:04.031 --> 19:06.465
If we did that,
they'd kill us.

19:06.534 --> 19:10.470
We don't want to let them
get away with this.

19:11.572 --> 19:14.973
Boy, I just eat this up
with a spoon.

19:15.042 --> 19:17.977
All right, youse two,
I want you at my party.

19:18.045 --> 19:18.977
What party?

19:19.046 --> 19:20.980
I'm losing
my piano player.

19:21.048 --> 19:23.482
He's going off
to fight the war.

19:23.551 --> 19:25.212
What war?

19:25.286 --> 19:27.117
The war
with the Spanish.

19:27.188 --> 19:29.315
<i>Remember
the Maine.</i>

19:29.390 --> 19:30.823
Who can forget it?

19:30.892 --> 19:33.656
I'm giving him a send-off.
so come on.

19:45.506 --> 19:47.440
When I was a kid,

19:47.508 --> 19:50.341
I always thought
I would grow up

19:50.411 --> 19:51.742
to be a hero.

19:51.812 --> 19:53.245
It's too late now.

19:53.314 --> 19:55.942
Why'd you say something
like that?

19:56.017 --> 19:58.383
You didn't have to say
something like that.

19:58.452 --> 20:00.386
You want me
to go alone

20:00.454 --> 20:02.888
and fight
the Hole-In-The-Wall Gang?

20:02.957 --> 20:04.390
That's fine with me.

20:04.458 --> 20:07.393
If you want your kids
to know you let me,

20:07.461 --> 20:09.190
<i>that's fine with me,</i>

20:09.263 --> 20:12.824
but I don't think
that's what you want.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.162
Is it?

20:18.806 --> 20:21.240
Why don't we enlist,
go fight the Spanish?

20:21.309 --> 20:23.243
You and me in the war.

20:23.311 --> 20:26.246
We got a lot of things
going for us...

20:26.314 --> 20:27.747
experience, maturity,
leadership.

20:27.815 --> 20:30.249
I'll bet
we end up officers.

20:30.318 --> 20:32.513
I'd be Major Parker.

20:34.021 --> 20:36.182
Parker?

20:36.257 --> 20:38.282
Yeah.
That's my real name.

20:40.161 --> 20:41.594
Robert Leroy Parker.

20:41.662 --> 20:43.095
No fooling?

20:43.164 --> 20:44.392
No.

20:48.970 --> 20:50.130
Mine's Longbaugh.

20:50.204 --> 20:51.796
No fooling.

20:51.872 --> 20:53.362
Long what?

20:53.441 --> 20:55.409
Harry Longbaugh.

20:55.476 --> 20:57.410
So you'd be
Major Longbaugh.

20:57.478 --> 20:58.911
What do you say?

21:03.417 --> 21:05.351
You just keep thinking,
Butch.

21:05.419 --> 21:07.353
That's what you're good at.

21:07.421 --> 21:08.854
<i>But you're not frightened.</i>

21:08.923 --> 21:09.855
<i>No, sir.</i>

21:09.924 --> 21:11.858
<i>You have got respect for me,</i>

21:11.926 --> 21:14.326
<i>and I have got
respect for you.</i>

21:14.395 --> 21:17.364
That's why you
and you and you

21:17.431 --> 21:19.422
are riding with me.
Am I right?

21:21.402 --> 21:23.962
Well, what do you say?

21:24.038 --> 21:26.063
I say this.

21:26.140 --> 21:30.042
I say, ladies
and gentlemen,

21:30.111 --> 21:32.375
boys and girls,
friends and enemies,

21:32.446 --> 21:33.879
meet the future!

21:33.948 --> 21:35.381
The future what?

21:35.449 --> 21:37.383
The future mode
of transportation

21:37.451 --> 21:39.646
for this weary
Western world.

21:39.720 --> 21:43.156
Now, I'm not going to make
a lot of extravagant claims.

21:43.224 --> 21:46.159
Sure, it'll change your
whole life for the better,

21:46.227 --> 21:47.660
but that's all.

21:47.728 --> 21:50.162
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

21:50.231 --> 21:51.664
You got the crowd together,

21:51.732 --> 21:54.166
so I thought I'd do
a little selling.

21:54.235 --> 21:56.669
I'm trying to raise
a posse here.

21:56.737 --> 21:58.170
A short presentation.

21:58.239 --> 21:59.672
The horse is dead.

21:59.740 --> 22:01.503
This item sells itself.

22:01.575 --> 22:05.011
<i>Are you going to listen
to him or come with me?</i>

22:05.079 --> 22:08.014
Butch, Fanny says to
come into her party

22:08.082 --> 22:09.049
right now.

22:09.116 --> 22:12.552
<i>No oats, no mess,
no kicks, no bites,</i>

22:12.620 --> 22:15.054
<i>no running away,
no stepping on your foot.</i>

22:15.122 --> 22:18.057
Well, I think
I'll get saddled up

22:18.125 --> 22:20.889
and go looking
for a woman.

22:20.961 --> 22:22.986
Good hunting.

22:24.932 --> 22:28.231
Shouldn't take more
than a couple of days.

22:32.440 --> 22:33.907
I'm not picky...

22:35.443 --> 22:37.377
as long as she's smart,

22:37.445 --> 22:39.072
pretty...

22:39.146 --> 22:40.636
sweet...

22:42.450 --> 22:44.213
gentle, and...

22:44.285 --> 22:47.550
tender and refined...

22:49.156 --> 22:50.384
lovely...

22:50.458 --> 22:52.016
carefree.

23:56.289 --> 23:57.347
Aah!

24:00.326 --> 24:02.487
Keep going,
teacher lady.

24:10.069 --> 24:12.799
It's OK Don't mind me.
Keep on going.

24:40.299 --> 24:42.358
Let down your hair.

24:54.380 --> 24:56.041
Shake your head.

26:05.485 --> 26:07.680
Do you know
what I wish?

26:07.754 --> 26:10.689
That once you'd get here
on time.

26:13.593 --> 26:16.585
You are mine,
Etta Place.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.596
Mine.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.097
You hear me?

26:20.166 --> 26:21.656
Mine.

26:21.734 --> 26:23.725
All mine.

26:27.306 --> 26:30.366
Your soft white flesh
is mine.

26:30.443 --> 26:31.740
Soft...

26:31.811 --> 26:33.403
white...

26:33.479 --> 26:35.709
bwhaa!

26:42.622 --> 26:44.055
Meet the future.

26:45.258 --> 26:47.692
Do you know
what you're doing?

26:47.760 --> 26:48.692
Theoretically.

26:48.761 --> 26:49.989
Aah!

30:07.959 --> 30:10.393
<i>You've come to get him
for the Flyer?</i>

30:10.462 --> 30:12.396
Would you believe
I'm broke already?

30:12.464 --> 30:14.898
Why is there never
any money, Butch?

30:14.966 --> 30:16.900
I swear, Etta,
I don't know.

30:16.968 --> 30:19.903
I've been working
like a dog all my life,

30:19.971 --> 30:22.906
and I can't get
a penny ahead.

30:22.974 --> 30:25.408
Sundance says it's because
you're a soft touch

30:25.477 --> 30:27.411
and always taking
expensive vacations,

30:27.479 --> 30:28.912
buying drinks
for everyone,

30:28.980 --> 30:30.914
and you're
a rotten gambler.

30:30.982 --> 30:33.416
That might have
something to do with it.

30:47.599 --> 30:48.531
Butch.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.567
Hmm?

30:49.634 --> 30:52.034
Do you ever wonder
if I'd met you first

30:52.103 --> 30:54.503
we'd been the ones
to get involved?

30:54.572 --> 30:57.541
We are involved, Etta.
Don't you know that?

30:59.611 --> 31:01.544
You are riding
on my bicycle.

31:01.612 --> 31:02.977
In some Arabian countries,

31:03.047 --> 31:04.981
that's the same
as being married.

31:09.887 --> 31:11.616
Hey.

31:12.689 --> 31:13.986
What are you doing?

31:14.058 --> 31:15.491
Stealing your woman.

31:18.896 --> 31:19.828
Take her.

31:19.897 --> 31:21.296
Take her.

31:22.566 --> 31:24.500
Well, you're
a romantic bastard.

31:24.568 --> 31:26.269
I'll give you that.

31:35.745 --> 31:37.679
OK, open up
in there.

31:37.747 --> 31:40.181
I work for
Mr. E.H. Harriman...

31:40.249 --> 31:41.682
Hey, Woodcock!

31:41.751 --> 31:43.184
Butch?

31:43.252 --> 31:44.310
You OK?

31:44.387 --> 31:45.820
Uh, well, sort of.

31:45.888 --> 31:48.823
Hey, that's wonderful.
Let's take a look at you.

31:50.092 --> 31:51.525
Well, now, Butch,

31:51.594 --> 31:54.028
you've got to have
more respect for me

31:54.096 --> 31:57.031
than to think I'd fall
for a stunt like that.

32:00.102 --> 32:02.662
You can't want to
get blown up again?

32:02.738 --> 32:05.673
Uh, Butch, you know
if it were my money,

32:05.741 --> 32:08.175
there's nobody I'd
rather have steal it

32:08.244 --> 32:09.176
than you.

32:09.245 --> 32:11.179
But I'm still
in the employ

32:11.247 --> 32:12.680
of Mr. E.H. Harriman

32:12.748 --> 32:14.682
of the Union Pacific
Railroad.

32:14.750 --> 32:16.149
Start this train!

32:16.218 --> 32:17.651
Get back inside,
lady.

32:17.720 --> 32:19.153
I'm not afraid of you.

32:19.221 --> 32:20.654
I'm not afraid
of anything.

32:20.723 --> 32:22.657
I'm a grandmother
and a female,

32:22.725 --> 32:24.158
and I've
got my rights.

32:24.226 --> 32:26.160
We got no time
for this.

32:26.228 --> 32:28.662
You can bull the others,
but not me.

32:28.731 --> 32:31.165
I've fought whiskey,
and I've fought gambling...

32:31.233 --> 32:33.565
We got no time
for this.

32:33.636 --> 32:36.070
What are you doing?
Let go!

32:36.138 --> 32:38.572
What are you
going to do to her?

32:38.641 --> 32:40.074
Well,
leave her alone.

32:40.142 --> 32:41.575
You're after
the money,

32:41.644 --> 32:43.077
and the money's
in here.

32:43.145 --> 32:44.578
Please! All I want

32:44.647 --> 32:46.581
is for somebody to
start this train.

32:46.649 --> 32:47.581
Somebody, please!

32:47.650 --> 32:49.083
Open the door,
Woodcock,

32:49.151 --> 32:50.584
or tell her
goodbye.

32:50.653 --> 32:53.087
Our Father,
who art in heaven,

32:53.155 --> 32:55.089
hallowed be Thy name,

32:55.157 --> 32:57.091
Thy kingdom come,

32:57.159 --> 32:59.093
Thy will be done,

32:59.161 --> 33:02.028
on earth
as it is in heaven.

33:02.098 --> 33:05.033
What am I going to tell
poor Mr. Harriman?

33:07.203 --> 33:10.138
Woodcock, what'd
you have to go and do

33:10.206 --> 33:11.639
something like that for?

33:11.707 --> 33:14.471
Well, Butch, you blew
the last one so easy,

33:14.543 --> 33:16.636
I just had to,
um, do something.

33:16.712 --> 33:19.647
Give me that
and get some more,

33:19.715 --> 33:21.080
a lot more!

33:22.885 --> 33:24.910
Well, that
ought to do it.

33:45.574 --> 33:48.008
Think you used enough
dynamite there, Butch?

33:51.080 --> 33:53.241
Ha ha ha ha.

34:43.132 --> 34:45.225
What the hell is that?

35:08.189 --> 35:10.555
Whatever they're selling,
I don't want it.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.765
Will you leave it?

35:28.543 --> 35:29.475
Come on!

35:29.544 --> 35:30.636
Hyah!

35:48.930 --> 35:49.862
Hey, Butch!

35:49.931 --> 35:50.989
What?

35:51.065 --> 35:52.464
They're very good!

35:54.903 --> 35:56.495
Split up!

36:09.017 --> 36:11.451
How many of 'em
are following us?

36:11.519 --> 36:12.952
All of 'em.

36:13.021 --> 36:14.283
All of 'em?

36:14.355 --> 36:17.119
What's the matter
with those guys?

36:17.191 --> 36:18.818
Hyah!

37:46.481 --> 37:49.973
I think we lost 'em.
Do you think we lost 'em?

37:50.051 --> 37:51.882
No.

37:51.953 --> 37:54.046
Neither do I. Hyah!

38:10.638 --> 38:12.970
Take our horses out
back. Feed 'em good.

38:13.040 --> 38:13.972
Where's Sweetface?

38:14.041 --> 38:15.474
Just inside.
Trouble?

38:15.543 --> 38:16.475
Listen,
you dirty old man,

38:16.544 --> 38:18.478
I know you're
a lying thief

38:18.546 --> 38:19.979
and so do you,

38:20.047 --> 38:22.481
but who'd know it
to look at you?

38:22.550 --> 38:23.983
Get yourself
out front fast.

38:24.051 --> 38:25.484
You seen us
ride through

38:25.553 --> 38:26.986
not five minutes
ago.

38:27.054 --> 38:28.487
Do this right,

38:28.556 --> 38:30.490
I'll get you
an old dog to kick.

38:30.558 --> 38:32.992
Here, room 9.
Top of the stairs.

38:46.741 --> 38:49.175
Hey, you realize
you're driving me crazy

38:49.243 --> 38:51.177
staring out
the window like that?

38:51.245 --> 38:53.475
I swear, Sweetface
can handle it, easy.

38:53.548 --> 38:55.482
He wouldn't dare
louse me up.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.984
He's that scared of me.

39:03.090 --> 39:05.923
Hey, kid, how can I
give Agnes

39:05.993 --> 39:07.425
the concentration
she deserves

39:07.494 --> 39:10.429
with you staring out
the window like that?

39:10.497 --> 39:11.930
Butch, you're
really something,

39:11.998 --> 39:13.556
you know that?

39:13.633 --> 39:16.101
Could you be
a little more specific

39:16.169 --> 39:17.431
about that, Agnes?

39:18.505 --> 39:19.437
Butch!

39:26.012 --> 39:28.947
OK, Sweetface,
give them a nice smile.

39:29.015 --> 39:30.448
Come on.

39:32.519 --> 39:33.952
That's a nice touch.

39:34.020 --> 39:35.954
<i>I swear, if he told me</i>

39:36.022 --> 39:38.456
I rode out of town
10 minutes ago,

39:38.525 --> 39:39.787
I'd believe him.

39:41.528 --> 39:43.359
And there they go.

39:52.038 --> 39:53.471
No, no.

39:53.540 --> 39:55.474
Don't ask me
to stay.

40:03.516 --> 40:05.984
You're the only
real man I ever met.

40:06.052 --> 40:07.986
You know that, Butch?

40:08.054 --> 40:10.488
It's not just 'cause
of all that money

40:10.557 --> 40:13.492
you got to spend
on people. It's you.

40:13.560 --> 40:14.993
The way you're always

40:15.061 --> 40:17.495
looking to see
am I happy or not?

40:17.564 --> 40:19.498
A lot of
the other girls,

40:19.566 --> 40:21.500
they... they
might want you

40:21.568 --> 40:24.002
for when you
got lots of money

40:24.070 --> 40:25.002
to spend on people.

40:25.071 --> 40:28.006
Me, I... I
don't care about...

40:28.074 --> 40:31.510
clothes and
money and jewels...

40:32.579 --> 40:35.013
and furs,

40:35.081 --> 40:37.015
and
things like that.

40:37.083 --> 40:39.517
Lots of the other
girls do,

40:39.586 --> 40:41.520
but I never did.

40:41.588 --> 40:43.556
I always said,
"Agnes..."

41:01.608 --> 41:04.236
Don't move.

41:04.310 --> 41:05.470
Stand up.

41:05.545 --> 41:07.479
Put your hands up.

41:07.547 --> 41:08.639
Higher.

41:10.550 --> 41:12.484
Now turn around
and start...

41:17.557 --> 41:20.617
Get our horses and
come on back here.

41:28.568 --> 41:29.500
Hyah!

41:29.569 --> 41:31.833
Get out of here!

41:31.905 --> 41:32.929
Get out!

41:36.076 --> 41:37.509
Go on!

41:37.577 --> 41:40.011
Get out of here,
you fat-headed beast!

41:41.581 --> 41:42.605
Come on!

41:42.682 --> 41:45.583
You're the fat-headed beast.
Quit shouting!

41:45.652 --> 41:47.950
Boy, somebody
sure trained 'em.

42:17.450 --> 42:18.576
Which way?

42:18.651 --> 42:20.710
Well,
it doesn't matter.

42:20.787 --> 42:22.721
I don't know where
we've been,

42:22.789 --> 42:24.222
and I've just
been there.

42:24.290 --> 42:26.053
They can't follow us.
We're safe.

42:26.126 --> 42:27.320
You really think so?

42:27.393 --> 42:29.293
I will if you will.

42:58.591 --> 43:01.958
How long you figure
we've been watching?

43:02.028 --> 43:03.859
Oh, a while.

43:16.508 --> 43:20.444
How long before you figure
they're not after us?

43:20.512 --> 43:21.979
A while longer.

43:24.550 --> 43:26.711
How come you're
so talkative?

43:28.387 --> 43:30.719
Just naturally
blabby, I guess.

43:33.992 --> 43:36.426
Ohh! I haven't done
so much riding

43:36.495 --> 43:37.928
since I quit rustling.

43:37.996 --> 43:39.930
That's a miserable
occupation.

43:39.998 --> 43:42.990
Dusk to dawn,
no sleep, rotten food.

43:47.573 --> 43:49.507
Hey.

43:49.575 --> 43:51.042
I see it.

43:55.581 --> 43:57.515
Torches you think?

43:57.583 --> 43:59.016
Yeah, maybe.

43:59.084 --> 44:00.517
Maybe lanterns.

44:01.587 --> 44:03.452
They're
following our path.

44:05.023 --> 44:07.423
Dead on it.

44:07.492 --> 44:09.926
I couldn't do that.
Could you do that?

44:09.995 --> 44:11.929
How can they do that?

44:13.165 --> 44:14.962
Who are those guys?

44:27.346 --> 44:29.280
You sure
this'll work?

44:29.348 --> 44:30.280
It'll work.

44:30.349 --> 44:32.283
That's what you said
about Sweetface.

44:32.351 --> 44:33.784
This'll work.

44:57.576 --> 44:59.510
Once they divide up,

44:59.578 --> 45:02.445
we take them,
no trouble, right?

45:02.514 --> 45:03.913
Maybe.

45:03.982 --> 45:05.415
Boy, for a gunman,

45:05.484 --> 45:07.452
you're one hell
of a pessimist.

45:08.520 --> 45:09.953
They ought to get

45:10.022 --> 45:14.789
to where we split up
any time.

45:14.860 --> 45:16.760
They're
just about there.

45:19.230 --> 45:23.564
How many of them do you
think will come our way?

45:23.634 --> 45:25.568
Oh, I wish
we had rifles.

45:25.636 --> 45:27.467
I mean,
they got rifles.

45:27.538 --> 45:29.972
But we got surprise
on our side, right?

45:35.546 --> 45:38.208
So far, they're
doing what we want.

45:42.553 --> 45:45.488
You think we ought to
take them from up here?

45:50.561 --> 45:53.496
Kid, look, you know this
work better than I do.

45:53.564 --> 45:54.997
Is it best here,

45:55.066 --> 45:57.330
or maybe down there,
closer to the trail?

45:59.770 --> 46:01.260
Uh...

46:03.407 --> 46:04.499
Damn it!

46:07.512 --> 46:10.447
They're not
going for it.

46:12.517 --> 46:14.712
Who are those guys?

46:14.785 --> 46:17.720
I don't know.

46:17.788 --> 46:18.948
I don't know.

46:19.023 --> 46:21.457
We got to do something
and shake them.

46:21.526 --> 46:23.460
Whatever
you come up with

46:23.528 --> 46:24.961
is fine with me,

46:25.029 --> 46:27.463
but whatever it is,
it better be now!

46:39.010 --> 46:40.944
What are you
doing here?

46:41.012 --> 46:42.445
Easy, Ray. Easy.

46:42.513 --> 46:45.448
What the hell do you mean,
take it easy?

46:45.516 --> 46:47.848
You promised you'd never
come into my territory.

46:47.919 --> 46:48.851
And we haven't.

46:48.920 --> 46:50.353
Just because
we were friendly

46:50.421 --> 46:52.855
doesn't give you
the right to break in.

46:52.924 --> 46:54.551
What if we was
seen together?

46:54.625 --> 46:57.560
I'm too old
to find another job.

46:57.628 --> 47:00.495
At least have the decency
to draw your guns.

47:00.565 --> 47:02.999
Listen, Butch is trying
to tell you something.

47:03.067 --> 47:05.501
All right.
What do you want?

47:05.570 --> 47:07.003
A couple of things.

47:07.071 --> 47:09.005
We want to enlist, Ray.

47:09.073 --> 47:10.938
In the army.
Right away.

47:11.008 --> 47:12.669
Go fight the Spanish.

47:17.781 --> 47:20.215
Oh, you're crazy.
You are crazy.

47:20.283 --> 47:22.717
You are,
both of you, crazy!

47:22.786 --> 47:27.223
They'd throw you in jail
for a thousand years each.

47:32.495 --> 47:35.726
Come on, Sundance.
Start trussing my feet.

47:38.101 --> 47:40.535
Here. You seen these
before. Come on!

47:40.604 --> 47:42.538
I'm not taking
the chance

47:42.606 --> 47:44.471
that someone
saw you coming in.

47:44.541 --> 47:45.974
We're serious about this.

47:46.042 --> 47:47.475
You are known outlaws.

47:47.544 --> 47:48.476
We'd quit.

47:48.545 --> 47:50.979
That's the point.
Is that on tight?

47:51.047 --> 47:51.979
That's all right.

47:52.048 --> 47:53.982
There's some hankies
in the drawer

47:54.050 --> 47:55.984
you can use
to gag me.

47:56.052 --> 47:57.679
I swear,
this'd work, Ray.

47:57.754 --> 48:00.188
You trust us.
The government trusts you.

48:00.257 --> 48:02.418
Anything you tell them
they gotta believe, right?

48:02.492 --> 48:05.427
You've never done
a dishonest thing ever,

48:05.495 --> 48:07.429
and you're pushing 60.
We'd quit.

48:07.497 --> 48:09.431
They'd drop the charges
against us,

48:09.499 --> 48:11.433
we'd fight till
the war is over.

48:11.501 --> 48:13.901
They don't even have
to make us officers.

48:13.970 --> 48:15.232
That's some proposition.

48:15.305 --> 48:17.102
They forget
all about the years

48:17.173 --> 48:18.435
of thieving and robbing.

48:18.508 --> 48:20.271
They take you
into the army,

48:20.343 --> 48:24.541
which is what you want
in the first place.

48:24.614 --> 48:26.047
There's something
out there

48:26.116 --> 48:28.277
that scares you, huh?

48:30.020 --> 48:31.453
But it's too late.

48:31.521 --> 48:33.455
You should've let
yourself get killed

48:33.523 --> 48:35.423
while you had
the chance.

48:35.492 --> 48:38.928
You may be the biggest
thing to hit this area,

48:38.995 --> 48:41.429
but you're still
two-bit outlaws.

48:41.498 --> 48:44.934
I never met a soul more
affable than you, Butch,

48:45.001 --> 48:46.434
or faster than the Kid.

48:46.503 --> 48:48.437
But you're still
two-bit outlaws

48:48.505 --> 48:49.437
on the dodge.

48:49.506 --> 48:51.736
It's over!
Don't you get that?

48:51.808 --> 48:53.241
Your times is over,

48:53.310 --> 48:55.244
and you're gonna
die bloody,

48:55.312 --> 48:58.406
and all you can do
is choose where.

48:58.481 --> 48:59.413
I'm sorry,

48:59.482 --> 49:02.246
I'm getting mean
in my old age.

49:02.319 --> 49:04.753
Come on. Shut me up,
Sundance.

51:24.827 --> 51:27.125
Ah, you're wasting
your time.

51:27.196 --> 51:29.630
They can't track us
over rock.

51:29.698 --> 51:31.131
Tell them that.

51:57.259 --> 51:59.693
They're beginning
to get on my nerves.

52:01.263 --> 52:03.356
Who are those guys?

52:05.400 --> 52:06.833
You remember the time

52:06.902 --> 52:09.336
you, me, and Etta
went to Denver

52:09.404 --> 52:10.336
for a vacation?

52:10.405 --> 52:12.839
I'm glad you
brought that up, Kid.

52:12.908 --> 52:15.342
That's an important topic,
considering our situation.

52:15.410 --> 52:17.344
The night we went
gambling, remember?

52:17.412 --> 52:19.346
We had dinner
at the hotel.

52:19.414 --> 52:21.848
Etta had roast beef,
and I had chicken.

52:21.917 --> 52:23.851
If I can remember
what you had,

52:23.919 --> 52:25.147
I'll die happy.

52:25.220 --> 52:26.152
Look out there.

52:26.221 --> 52:27.688
What?

52:27.756 --> 52:30.452
I got to talking to
some gambler that night.

52:30.526 --> 52:32.460
He told us
about an Indian...

52:32.528 --> 52:33.654
full-blooded Indian,

52:33.729 --> 52:35.458
except he used
an English name,

52:35.531 --> 52:37.328
Sir... somebody.

52:37.399 --> 52:38.388
Lord Baltimore?

52:38.467 --> 52:41.402
That's right, and he
could track anybody

52:41.470 --> 52:43.495
over anything
day or night.

52:43.572 --> 52:45.506
So?

52:45.574 --> 52:48.771
The guy on the ground,
I think it's him.

52:54.082 --> 52:56.016
No. Baltimore works
out of Oklahoma.

52:56.084 --> 52:57.711
He's strictly
an Oklahoma man.

52:57.786 --> 53:00.220
I don't know
where we are,

53:00.289 --> 53:01.722
but it isn't Oklahoma.

53:01.790 --> 53:03.655
Ah, it couldn't be him.

53:08.764 --> 53:10.322
It couldn't be him.

53:12.034 --> 53:13.194
I guess.

53:15.537 --> 53:16.970
Whoever it is,

53:17.039 --> 53:19.872
it sure the hell
is somebody.

53:49.637 --> 53:50.968
Damn it!

53:51.039 --> 53:54.475
Don't they get tired?
Don't they get hungry?

53:54.542 --> 53:55.975
They've gotta be.

53:56.044 --> 53:57.671
Why don't they
slow up?

53:57.745 --> 53:59.372
They could even
go faster.

53:59.447 --> 54:01.472
At least that'd
be a change.

54:01.549 --> 54:03.414
They don't even
break formation.

54:03.484 --> 54:04.416
Do something!

54:38.953 --> 54:40.614
Kid.

54:40.688 --> 54:42.485
What?

54:42.557 --> 54:44.081
Who's the best
lawman?

54:46.094 --> 54:47.061
Best? How?

54:47.128 --> 54:50.291
You mean toughest
or easiest to bribe?

54:50.365 --> 54:52.629
Toughest.

54:52.700 --> 54:55.635
Joe LeFors.

54:55.703 --> 54:57.637
Gotta be.

55:01.809 --> 55:04.175
LeFors never leaves
Wyoming. Never.

55:04.245 --> 55:06.145
You know that.

55:06.214 --> 55:08.148
He always wears
a white skimmer.

55:08.216 --> 55:10.480
That's how you tell
it's Joe LeFors,

55:10.551 --> 55:13.816
'cause he wears
a white straw hat.

55:13.888 --> 55:17.585
Look at that guy
out front.

55:36.576 --> 55:38.976
Jesus, who are those guys?

55:43.917 --> 55:44.849
Hyah!

55:44.918 --> 55:46.647
Come on now.

55:46.720 --> 55:48.415
Here you go, Kid.

56:32.532 --> 56:34.966
Go on! Get out of here!
Go on!

56:36.369 --> 56:38.633
What if they don't
follow the horse?

56:38.705 --> 56:40.036
You're the brains,
Butch.

56:40.107 --> 56:42.371
You'll think
of something.

58:09.229 --> 58:10.594
Damn it!

58:25.011 --> 58:26.444
The way I figure it,

58:26.513 --> 58:28.413
we can either fight
or give.

58:28.481 --> 58:30.415
If we give,
we go to jail.

58:30.483 --> 58:31.780
I've been there already.

58:31.852 --> 58:33.114
If we fight,

58:33.186 --> 58:34.778
they can stay
where they are

58:34.855 --> 58:36.186
and starve us out...

58:36.256 --> 58:38.486
or go for position,
shoot us.

58:38.558 --> 58:40.822
Might even get
a rock slide started.

58:40.894 --> 58:42.521
What else can they do?

58:42.596 --> 58:44.223
They could surrender to us,

58:44.297 --> 58:46.731
but I wouldn't
count on that.

58:46.800 --> 58:48.665
They're going for
position, all right.

58:48.735 --> 58:51.761
Better get ready.

58:54.908 --> 58:56.842
Kid, the next time
I say

58:56.910 --> 58:58.844
let's go someplace
like Bolivia,

58:58.912 --> 59:00.345
let's go someplace
like Bolivia.

59:00.413 --> 59:01.710
Next time.

59:03.516 --> 59:04.676
Ready?

59:06.820 --> 59:08.287
No. We'll jump.

59:12.993 --> 59:14.654
Like hell we will.

59:14.728 --> 59:16.161
No. It'll be O.K.

59:16.229 --> 59:17.856
if the water's
deep enough

59:17.931 --> 59:19.899
and we don't get
squished to death.

59:19.966 --> 59:21.297
They'll never follow us.

59:21.368 --> 59:22.595
How do you know?

59:22.668 --> 59:25.102
Would you jump that
if you didn't have to?

59:25.170 --> 59:27.104
I have to,
and I'm not gonna.

59:27.172 --> 59:29.106
We got to.
Otherwise we're dead.

59:29.174 --> 59:30.141
Come on.

59:30.209 --> 59:32.609
Just one clear shot...
that's all I want.

59:32.678 --> 59:34.612
I want to fight them!

59:34.680 --> 59:36.113
They'll kill us.

59:36.181 --> 59:37.113
Maybe.

59:37.182 --> 59:38.615
You want to die?

59:38.684 --> 59:40.982
Do you?

59:41.053 --> 59:43.317
All right,
I'll jump first.

59:43.389 --> 59:44.321
No.

59:44.390 --> 59:45.823
Then you jump first.

59:45.891 --> 59:46.823
No, I said.

59:46.892 --> 59:47.881
What's the matter?

59:47.960 --> 59:49.587
I can't swim!

59:59.538 --> 01:00:00.971
Why, you crazy?

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.474
The fall will
probably kill you.

01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:14.482
Oh-oh...

01:00:14.553 --> 01:00:16.748
ohhh...

01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:19.484
shiiiit!

01:00:26.765 --> 01:00:28.096
Hang on to me.

01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:29.361
You're drowning me!

01:00:29.435 --> 01:00:31.300
I can't help it.
I can't swim.

01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:32.803
You're choking me!

01:00:32.871 --> 01:00:34.304
I can't swim!

01:00:34.373 --> 01:00:35.635
I'm telling you,
if I drown,

01:00:35.708 --> 01:00:38.370
I swear to God
I'll kill you.

01:00:38.444 --> 01:00:40.742
Never said I was
a great swimmer.

01:00:43.615 --> 01:00:46.550
Oh! You're choking me!

01:00:46.618 --> 01:00:49.382
Oh! I'm choking!

01:00:49.455 --> 01:00:50.888
Let go of me.

01:00:50.956 --> 01:00:53.424
I'm choking!

01:00:53.492 --> 01:00:55.460
Let go of my throat.

01:01:22.955 --> 01:01:24.923
The papers said
they had you.

01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:28.187
Was it LeFors?
Did they say?

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.852
Joe LeFors?

01:01:29.929 --> 01:01:31.362
I think so.

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:32.863
And their tracker?

01:01:32.932 --> 01:01:33.864
Tracker?

01:01:33.933 --> 01:01:35.366
Was it Lord Baltimore?

01:01:35.434 --> 01:01:36.867
I think so.

01:01:36.936 --> 01:01:38.369
The paper's inside.

01:01:45.144 --> 01:01:47.578
You got enough
to feed us?

01:01:47.646 --> 01:01:50.376
Don't you know I do?

01:01:50.449 --> 01:01:52.178
They said you were dead.

01:01:52.251 --> 01:01:55.186
Don't make a big thing
out of it.

01:01:57.690 --> 01:02:00.625
No. Make a big thing
out of it.

01:02:05.164 --> 01:02:07.098
Hey.

01:02:07.166 --> 01:02:10.499
It was Baltimore
and LeFors.

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:20.237
You know who else?

01:02:20.312 --> 01:02:21.279
Who?

01:02:21.347 --> 01:02:22.780
Jeff Carr,
George Hiatt...

01:02:22.848 --> 01:02:23.780
Hiatt?

01:02:23.849 --> 01:02:25.282
T.T. Kelliher.

01:02:29.121 --> 01:02:31.612
We lucked out getting away.

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:32.987
You know that?

01:02:34.994 --> 01:02:36.518
Why would these guys
join up

01:02:36.595 --> 01:02:38.119
and take after us, though?

01:02:38.197 --> 01:02:40.131
Forget it.
Bunch like that

01:02:40.199 --> 01:02:41.530
won't stay together
long.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.532
They will...

01:02:42.601 --> 01:02:44.967
if Mr. Harriman
has his way.

01:02:45.037 --> 01:02:45.969
Who?

01:02:46.038 --> 01:02:47.096
Mr. E.H. Harriman

01:02:47.172 --> 01:02:48.537
of the Union Pacific
Railroad.

01:02:48.607 --> 01:02:51.542
He resents the way you've
been picking on him,

01:02:51.610 --> 01:02:53.544
so he's outfitted
a special train

01:02:53.612 --> 01:02:55.546
and hired
special employees.

01:02:55.614 --> 01:02:57.548
You've been avoiding them
for two days.

01:02:57.616 --> 01:02:59.049
It's really
sort of flattering

01:02:59.118 --> 01:03:01.552
if you want to think
about it that way.

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:03.554
A setup like that
costs more

01:03:03.622 --> 01:03:05.055
than we ever took.

01:03:05.124 --> 01:03:06.557
Apparently
he can afford it.

01:03:09.128 --> 01:03:10.720
That crazy Harriman.

01:03:13.132 --> 01:03:14.565
That's bad business.

01:03:14.633 --> 01:03:15.998
How long
do you think

01:03:16.068 --> 01:03:17.501
I'd stay
in operation

01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:19.504
if every job
cost me money?

01:03:19.572 --> 01:03:22.006
If he'd just pay me
what he's spending

01:03:22.074 --> 01:03:24.008
to make me
stop robbing him,

01:03:24.076 --> 01:03:25.508
I'd stop
robbing him.

01:03:28.079 --> 01:03:31.014
You probably inherited
every penny you got!

01:03:31.082 --> 01:03:32.014
Inherited guys,

01:03:32.083 --> 01:03:34.017
what the hell
do they know?

01:03:34.085 --> 01:03:36.349
You say they were
hired permanent?

01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:39.356
No. Just till
they kill you.

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:51.864
That means they're still
after us, Butch,

01:03:51.936 --> 01:03:54.234
and it's going to be
the same thing

01:03:54.305 --> 01:03:55.704
all over again.

01:03:59.611 --> 01:04:01.545
They'll show up here...

01:04:01.613 --> 01:04:03.046
sooner or later.

01:04:20.064 --> 01:04:20.996
Hey, Etta.

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:24.501
I'll get you
some more.

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:28.005
Butch and me have been
talking it all over.

01:04:28.072 --> 01:04:30.006
Wherever the hell
Bolivia is,

01:04:30.074 --> 01:04:32.008
that's where we're off to.

01:04:32.076 --> 01:04:34.510
We'll go down there
and play it safe,

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:37.013
maybe keep our hand in
a little bit.

01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:38.514
Butch speaks some Spanish.

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:41.017
I can wrestle
with a menu O.K.

01:04:41.085 --> 01:04:43.019
And you speak it good.

01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:48.025
And it'd be good cover
going with a woman.

01:04:48.092 --> 01:04:50.026
No one expects it.

01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:53.530
Then we could
travel safer.

01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:56.532
What I'm saying is,

01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:58.034
if you want to go,

01:04:58.102 --> 01:04:59.535
I won't stop you,

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:01.538
but the minute
you start to whine

01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:03.039
or make a nuisance,

01:05:03.107 --> 01:05:05.041
I don't care
where we are,

01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:06.542
I'm dumping you flat.

01:05:06.611 --> 01:05:08.545
Don't sugarcoat it
like that, Kid.

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:10.046
Tell her straight.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.485
I'm 26, and I'm single

01:05:17.555 --> 01:05:18.988
and a schoolteacher,

01:05:19.057 --> 01:05:21.992
and that's the
bottom of the pit.

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:23.994
And the only excitement
I've known

01:05:24.062 --> 01:05:25.495
is here with me now.

01:05:25.563 --> 01:05:26.996
So I'll go with you,

01:05:27.065 --> 01:05:28.498
and I won't whine,

01:05:28.566 --> 01:05:29.999
and I'll sew
your socks,

01:05:30.068 --> 01:05:32.502
and I'll stitch you
when you're wounded,

01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:35.004
and I'll do anything
you ask of me

01:05:35.073 --> 01:05:36.506
except one thing.

01:05:36.574 --> 01:05:38.508
I won't watch you die.

01:05:38.576 --> 01:05:40.009
I'll miss that scene,

01:05:40.078 --> 01:05:41.511
if you don't mind.

01:06:15.613 --> 01:06:16.978
The future's all yours,

01:06:17.048 --> 01:06:18.982
you lousy bicycles.

01:11:23.519 --> 01:11:26.454
Well, you know,
it could be worse.

01:11:26.522 --> 01:11:30.151
You get a lot more
for your money in Bolivia.

01:11:30.225 --> 01:11:31.658
I checked on it.

01:11:31.726 --> 01:11:33.159
What could they have here

01:11:33.228 --> 01:11:36.459
that you could possibly
want to buy?

01:11:40.535 --> 01:11:42.969
Jeez, all Bolivia
can't look like this.

01:11:43.038 --> 01:11:44.630
How do you know?

01:11:44.706 --> 01:11:46.970
This might be
the garden spot

01:11:47.042 --> 01:11:48.475
of the whole country.

01:11:48.543 --> 01:11:50.477
People may travel
hundreds of miles

01:11:50.545 --> 01:11:52.479
just to get to this spot

01:11:52.547 --> 01:11:53.809
where we're standing now.

01:11:53.882 --> 01:11:55.816
This might be
the Atlantic City, New Jersey,

01:11:55.884 --> 01:11:57.818
of all Bolivia
for all you know.

01:11:57.886 --> 01:11:59.319
I know more
about Bolivia

01:11:59.387 --> 01:12:01.321
than you know about
Atlantic City, New Jersey,

01:12:01.389 --> 01:12:02.720
I can tell you that.

01:12:02.791 --> 01:12:04.986
Aha!

01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:07.494
You do, huh?

01:12:07.562 --> 01:12:09.496
I was born there.

01:12:09.564 --> 01:12:11.998
I was born
in New Jersey...

01:12:12.067 --> 01:12:14.035
brought up there, so...

01:12:14.102 --> 01:12:15.592
I didn't know that.

01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:18.002
The total tonnage
of what you don't know

01:12:18.073 --> 01:12:19.506
is enough to shatter...

01:12:19.574 --> 01:12:20.734
We're not
accomplishing

01:12:20.809 --> 01:12:22.003
as much as we might.

01:12:22.077 --> 01:12:24.511
Listen, your job
is to back me up,

01:12:24.579 --> 01:12:26.274
because you'd starve
without me.

01:12:27.749 --> 01:12:30.013
And you,
your job is to shut up.

01:12:34.589 --> 01:12:36.022
He'll feel a lot better

01:12:36.091 --> 01:12:38.525
after he's robbed
a couple of banks.

01:12:39.761 --> 01:12:42.025
Ha ha ha ha!

01:12:44.099 --> 01:12:45.532
Bolivia.

01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:56.543
Hell,
it's just a bank

01:12:56.611 --> 01:12:58.044
like any other bank.

01:12:58.113 --> 01:13:00.047
You got to
move in slowly,

01:13:00.115 --> 01:13:01.548
check out
everything.

01:13:01.616 --> 01:13:03.049
The thing
to remember...

01:13:03.118 --> 01:13:05.552
Don't tell me
how to rob a bank.

01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:08.054
I know how
to rob a bank.

01:13:08.123 --> 01:13:10.557
A few dark clouds
appear on your horizon,

01:13:10.625 --> 01:13:13.560
and you just go all
to pieces, don't you?

01:13:33.081 --> 01:13:34.514
<i>Buenos días, señores.</i>

01:13:34.582 --> 01:13:36.072
<i>¿Les puedo servir
en algo?</i>

01:13:36.151 --> 01:13:39.018
<i>Ordenen para atenderlos
por favor inmediatamente.</i>

01:13:41.089 --> 01:13:43.023
<i>¿Quieren hacer
algún depósito?</i>

01:13:45.093 --> 01:13:46.526
<i>¿Quieren abrir
una cuenta?</i>

01:13:46.594 --> 01:13:49.028
<i>Bien, el cajero los
atienda inmediatamente.</i>

01:13:49.097 --> 01:13:51.031
<i>Los atendemos por todo.</i>

01:13:57.105 --> 01:13:58.538
<i>Señor?</i>

01:14:09.884 --> 01:14:11.044
<i>Adiós.</i>

01:14:12.554 --> 01:14:14.545
This is a robbery.

01:14:14.622 --> 01:14:16.988
<i>Esto es un robo.</i>

01:14:17.058 --> 01:14:19.993
<i>Esto es un robo.</i>

01:14:25.066 --> 01:14:27.500
This is supposed to be
a unison recitation.

01:14:27.569 --> 01:14:30.003
Why do I have to
do any of this?

01:14:30.071 --> 01:14:31.504
He's the one

01:14:31.573 --> 01:14:33.507
who claimed he knew
the language.

01:14:33.575 --> 01:14:35.509
Your line of work requires
a specialized vocabulary.

01:14:35.577 --> 01:14:38.239
I got nervous. I forgot
the words. Shoot me.

01:14:38.313 --> 01:14:40.372
You've had
worse ideas lately.

01:14:40.448 --> 01:14:42.006
Raise
your hands.

01:14:43.585 --> 01:14:46.019
<i>Uh... las manos arriba.</i>

01:14:46.087 --> 01:14:47.520
Raise them.

01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:50.523
<i>Arriba.</i>

01:14:50.592 --> 01:14:53.527
All of you back
against the wall.

01:14:53.595 --> 01:14:58.032
<i>Todos ustedes, um...</i>

01:14:58.099 --> 01:15:01.535
<i>arrímense a la pared.</i>

01:15:01.603 --> 01:15:03.537
Give me the money.

01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:11.772
Give me the money.

01:15:11.846 --> 01:15:14.041
Give me the money.

01:15:14.115 --> 01:15:15.980
This is not
going to work,

01:15:16.050 --> 01:15:18.484
and we're going to be
up all night

01:15:18.553 --> 01:15:19.986
until you get this.

01:15:20.054 --> 01:15:21.988
Now give me the money.

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.994
It's on the tip
of my tongue, Etta.

01:15:28.062 --> 01:15:29.495
I swear it.

01:15:31.566 --> 01:15:34.056
Butch, are you still
thinking in there?

01:15:34.134 --> 01:15:37.103
What the hell else
is there to do?

01:15:37.171 --> 01:15:39.503
Try this one.

01:15:39.573 --> 01:15:42.201
Where is the safe?
Open it.

01:15:42.276 --> 01:15:44.005
<i>Dónde es...</i>

01:15:48.081 --> 01:15:50.515
Uh, that's a hard one.

01:15:53.086 --> 01:15:55.748
<i>¿Dónde está la caja?
¡Ábrala!</i>

01:15:55.822 --> 01:15:58.586
That's very good, Butch.

01:15:58.659 --> 01:16:01.025
You're a good teacher,
Etta.

01:16:02.663 --> 01:16:04.096
<i>¡Esto es un robo!</i>

01:16:10.037 --> 01:16:12.505
<i>Manos a...</i>

01:16:12.573 --> 01:16:14.473
<i>Manos, um...</i>

01:16:21.381 --> 01:16:23.246
<i>¡Manos arriba!</i>

01:16:23.317 --> 01:16:25.114
They got them up!
Skip down!

01:16:25.185 --> 01:16:26.777
<i>- ¡Arriba!
- Skip on down!</i>

01:16:26.853 --> 01:16:30.311
<i>Todos ustedes arrísmense
a la pared.</i>

01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:32.449
They're against
the wall already!

01:16:32.526 --> 01:16:33.458
<i>Dónde es...</i>

01:16:33.527 --> 01:16:34.960
Oh, you're so damn smart,

01:16:35.028 --> 01:16:36.495
you read it.

01:16:45.239 --> 01:16:46.672
A goddamn crib sheet.

01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:48.173
You almost blew it.

01:16:48.242 --> 01:16:49.675
You sure didn't help much.

01:16:49.743 --> 01:16:52.678
You can't do anything
without a crib sheet.

01:17:08.128 --> 01:17:11.029
For God's sake,
don't drop the money!

01:17:11.098 --> 01:17:13.066
I won't drop the money!

01:17:13.133 --> 01:17:14.532
<i>Voy a traer
el comisario.</i>

01:17:14.601 --> 01:17:15.829
<i>Sí, vamos.</i>

01:17:15.902 --> 01:17:16.766
<i>Ay, nombre.</i>

01:17:16.837 --> 01:17:17.769
<i>Evarista.</i>

01:17:17.838 --> 01:17:18.964
<i>¿Evarista qué?</i>

01:17:19.039 --> 01:17:20.301
<i>Señor comandante,</i>

01:17:20.374 --> 01:17:22.968
<i>dos hombres acometen
y asaltan el banco.</i>

01:17:23.043 --> 01:17:24.806
<i>Dos yanquis
y una muchacha</i>

01:17:24.878 --> 01:17:26.641
<i>se fueron por la cañada.</i>

01:17:26.713 --> 01:17:28.977
<i>Se llevaron mi pistola
y todo el dinero.</i>

01:17:29.049 --> 01:17:29.981
<i>Vámanos!</i>

01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:30.982
<i>A caballos!</i>

01:18:23.437 --> 01:18:25.234
Isn't that
a pretty sight?

01:18:28.141 --> 01:18:30.473
Well, we're back in business,
boys and girls,

01:18:30.544 --> 01:18:31.977
just like the old days.

01:22:59.711 --> 01:23:01.542
Let's stay here
and get him

01:23:01.613 --> 01:23:03.046
and be done with it.

01:23:03.114 --> 01:23:04.547
But what if
we lose?

01:23:04.616 --> 01:23:06.550
We saw him
with two guys.

01:23:06.618 --> 01:23:08.051
What if he's got 20?

01:23:08.119 --> 01:23:10.553
You don't know for sure
it's LeFors.

01:23:10.622 --> 01:23:12.556
I'm a hell of a guesser.

01:23:12.624 --> 01:23:14.558
He can't arrest you.
It's a foreign country.

01:23:14.626 --> 01:23:15.991
He can't take you back.

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:17.994
He's not going to
take anybody back.

01:23:18.062 --> 01:23:19.996
He's going to
wait for us

01:23:20.064 --> 01:23:21.497
to pull
another job

01:23:21.566 --> 01:23:22.999
and then
hunt us down.

01:23:23.067 --> 01:23:24.500
Let's finish it now,
Butch,

01:23:24.569 --> 01:23:26.002
one way
or the other.

01:23:27.572 --> 01:23:29.506
He's got to wait for us

01:23:29.574 --> 01:23:31.007
to pull another job.

01:23:32.577 --> 01:23:35.011
Well, what if there isn't
another job?

01:23:35.079 --> 01:23:36.512
He can't arrest us,

01:23:36.581 --> 01:23:39.014
and he can't take us
out of here.

01:23:39.082 --> 01:23:40.515
We'll drive him crazy.

01:23:40.584 --> 01:23:42.017
We'll outlast
the bastard.

01:23:42.085 --> 01:23:43.347
We'll go straight.

01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:45.513
So you want jobs.

01:23:45.589 --> 01:23:48.524
You're from the U.S. of A.,

01:23:48.592 --> 01:23:51.026
and you are seeking
after employment.

01:23:51.094 --> 01:23:53.028
Well, you couldn't
have picked

01:23:53.096 --> 01:23:55.530
a more
out of the way place

01:23:55.599 --> 01:23:57.032
in all of Bolivia,

01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:58.533
I'll tell you that.

01:23:58.602 --> 01:24:00.536
<i>Gracias, Jesús.</i>

01:24:00.604 --> 01:24:03.539
Ordinarily
you've got to wait

01:24:03.607 --> 01:24:05.541
to work for
Percy Garrison,

01:24:05.609 --> 01:24:07.543
but this ain't
ordinarily.

01:24:07.611 --> 01:24:08.543
Bingo.

01:24:08.612 --> 01:24:10.546
You mean there are jobs.

01:24:10.614 --> 01:24:12.047
Yes, there are jobs.

01:24:12.115 --> 01:24:13.548
There are lots
of jobs.

01:24:13.617 --> 01:24:15.551
Don't you want to
know why?

01:24:15.619 --> 01:24:16.677
Yeah, why?

01:24:17.854 --> 01:24:19.481
Damn it.

01:24:19.556 --> 01:24:22.992
Because I cannot
promise to pay you.

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:25.324
Don't you want to
know why?

01:24:26.463 --> 01:24:27.987
OK, why?

01:24:29.566 --> 01:24:32.501
On account of
the payroll thieves,

01:24:32.569 --> 01:24:34.002
fellow citizens.

01:24:34.071 --> 01:24:36.005
You see,
every mine around

01:24:36.073 --> 01:24:38.007
gets its payroll

01:24:38.075 --> 01:24:39.508
from La Paz.

01:24:39.576 --> 01:24:41.009
And every
mine around

01:24:41.078 --> 01:24:43.512
gets its payroll
held up.

01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:49.018
Some say it's the
Bolivian Bandits,

01:24:49.086 --> 01:24:50.519
and some say

01:24:50.587 --> 01:24:54.023
<i>that it's the
bandidos yanquis.</i>

01:24:54.091 --> 01:24:55.524
Could I see that?

01:24:58.895 --> 01:25:01.022
Mm-hmm.

01:25:01.098 --> 01:25:03.032
Fairly nice-looking
piece.

01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:05.534
Can you hit
anything?

01:25:05.602 --> 01:25:07.035
Sometimes.

01:25:16.046 --> 01:25:17.513
Hit that.

01:25:23.553 --> 01:25:25.487
No, no, son.
No, son.

01:25:25.555 --> 01:25:27.489
I just want to know,

01:25:27.557 --> 01:25:29.991
can you shoot
your piece?

01:25:32.729 --> 01:25:33.661
Shoot.

01:25:44.808 --> 01:25:46.503
Damn it.

01:25:46.576 --> 01:25:48.510
Can I move?

01:25:48.578 --> 01:25:49.510
Move?

01:25:49.579 --> 01:25:52.070
What the hell
you mean, move?

01:25:57.087 --> 01:25:59.021
I'm better
when I move.

01:25:59.089 --> 01:26:00.351
Yeah.

01:26:01.591 --> 01:26:03.525
Well, considering
that I'm desperate

01:26:03.593 --> 01:26:06.027
and you're just what
I'm looking for,

01:26:06.096 --> 01:26:07.529
on top of which

01:26:07.597 --> 01:26:10.031
you stem
from the U.S. of A.,

01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:11.533
we start
tomorrow morning.

01:26:11.601 --> 01:26:13.535
You mean we got jobs.

01:26:13.603 --> 01:26:15.036
Payroll guard.

01:26:15.105 --> 01:26:15.969
Damn.

01:26:16.039 --> 01:26:17.973
<i>Vámanos
a trabajar!</i>

01:26:18.041 --> 01:26:19.303
Hey, Chucho!

01:26:19.376 --> 01:26:20.468
Chucho!

01:26:52.275 --> 01:26:54.505
I think they're in
the trees up ahead.

01:26:54.578 --> 01:26:56.512
In the bushes
on the left.

01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:58.514
They're in the trees
up ahead.

01:26:58.582 --> 01:27:00.015
You take the trees,

01:27:00.083 --> 01:27:01.516
I'll take
the bushes.

01:27:01.585 --> 01:27:04.179
Will you two beginners
cut it out?

01:27:04.254 --> 01:27:07.052
Well, we're just trying
to spot an ambush.

01:27:07.123 --> 01:27:09.023
Morons.

01:27:09.092 --> 01:27:12.027
I've got morons
on my team.

01:27:12.095 --> 01:27:14.529
Nobody is going to
rob us

01:27:14.598 --> 01:27:15.963
going down the mountain.

01:27:16.032 --> 01:27:17.966
We have got no money

01:27:18.034 --> 01:27:19.503
going down the mountain.

01:27:19.636 --> 01:27:22.469
When we have got
the money

01:27:22.539 --> 01:27:24.336
on the way back,

01:27:24.407 --> 01:27:25.965
then you can sweat.

01:27:26.042 --> 01:27:27.600
Bingo.

01:27:27.677 --> 01:27:28.974
Move it out!

01:27:30.046 --> 01:27:31.013
Move it!

01:27:54.069 --> 01:27:57.004
We hit this place
in June, didn't we?

01:28:09.385 --> 01:28:11.012
Jones!

01:28:11.086 --> 01:28:13.350
Give me a hand
over here.

01:28:13.422 --> 01:28:15.947
Who am I,
Smith or Jones?

01:28:16.025 --> 01:28:17.458
Live.

01:28:34.543 --> 01:28:36.477
About
a half hour more,

01:28:36.545 --> 01:28:38.979
and we can start
to worry...

01:28:39.048 --> 01:28:40.481
as soon as we get

01:28:40.549 --> 01:28:41.982
to that pass
up there.

01:28:42.051 --> 01:28:44.485
We'll be all right
till then.

01:28:44.553 --> 01:28:46.487
They might
try something here.

01:28:46.555 --> 01:28:48.523
No. Better cover
up there.

01:28:50.559 --> 01:28:52.993
You got to relax,
you fellas.

01:28:53.062 --> 01:28:56.156
You got to get used
to Bolivian ways.

01:28:56.231 --> 01:28:58.165
You got to go easy.

01:28:58.233 --> 01:28:59.165
Damn it!

01:28:59.234 --> 01:29:00.667
Like I do.

01:29:00.736 --> 01:29:03.671
Of course, you probably
think I'm crazy,

01:29:03.739 --> 01:29:05.502
but I'm not.

01:29:05.574 --> 01:29:07.007
Bingo.

01:29:07.076 --> 01:29:08.008
I'm colorful.

01:29:08.077 --> 01:29:09.510
That's what happens

01:29:09.578 --> 01:29:12.172
when you live 10 years
alone in Bolivia.

01:29:12.247 --> 01:29:13.874
You get colorful.

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:34.968
Where are they?

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.065
I can't see them.

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:56.023
Let's get
out of here.

01:31:29.384 --> 01:31:32.319
Tell them to leave
the money and go.

01:31:33.655 --> 01:31:36.283
<i>Dijen el dinoro...</i>

01:31:36.358 --> 01:31:38.792
<i>Dinero...
and, uh...</i>

01:31:38.861 --> 01:31:40.385
<i>y váyanese.</i>

01:31:42.097 --> 01:31:45.065
<i>¿Que dejemos el dinero
y nos vayamos?</i>

01:31:45.133 --> 01:31:46.896
Tell them
we were hired

01:31:46.968 --> 01:31:50.131
to take it back.
It's our job.

01:31:50.204 --> 01:31:52.638
Tell them the money
isn't ours.

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:55.674
<i>El dinero...</i>

01:31:55.743 --> 01:31:57.370
<i>no es nuestro.</i>

01:31:57.445 --> 01:31:59.879
<i>No, ya no es de ustedes.</i>

01:31:59.947 --> 01:32:01.380
<i>Ahora es de nosotros.</i>

01:32:01.449 --> 01:32:02.575
<i>Claro.</i>

01:32:04.385 --> 01:32:07.286
We'll try
telling them again.

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:11.451
It's our job.
The money isn't ours.

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:14.825
<i>El dinero
no es nuestro.</i>

01:32:14.896 --> 01:32:16.625
<i>Lo necesitamos.</i>

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:19.188
<i>También nosotros
necesitamos.</i>

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:22.068
What do you think?

01:32:22.136 --> 01:32:23.603
Not so good.

01:32:23.671 --> 01:32:25.571
Can you take the two
on the right?

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:28.768
Kid, there's something
I think I ought to tell you.

01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:30.777
I never shot
anybody before.

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:38.777
One hell of a time
to tell me.

01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:46.426
Try for the two
on the right

01:32:46.494 --> 01:32:47.426
dead center.

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:49.429
That way, if you
miss a little,

01:32:49.497 --> 01:32:50.930
you'll still
hit something.

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:52.795
Go.

01:32:52.867 --> 01:32:53.799
Please.

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:55.392
<i>¿Qué?</i>

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:56.731
<i>Por favor.</i>

01:32:56.804 --> 01:32:58.328
<i>¿Por favor?</i>

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:10.748
Aah!

01:33:46.487 --> 01:33:48.546
Well,
we've gone straight.

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:54.022
What'll we try now?

01:34:11.311 --> 01:34:14.246
There are other ways of
going straight, you know.

01:34:28.628 --> 01:34:31.062
There are other ways
of going straight.

01:34:34.501 --> 01:34:35.763
There's farming.

01:34:39.172 --> 01:34:41.106
We could buy a place.

01:34:42.375 --> 01:34:44.809
I don't know
how to farm.

01:34:48.348 --> 01:34:50.282
What about a ranch,
then?

01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:52.409
I don't know.

01:34:52.485 --> 01:34:54.919
The last time
we tried ranching

01:34:54.988 --> 01:34:56.922
was during
our rustling days.

01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.922
Even then,

01:34:57.991 --> 01:35:00.425
we weren't much good
at it.

01:35:00.493 --> 01:35:02.427
It's hard.
Hours are brutal.

01:35:02.495 --> 01:35:04.929
No, you got to be
a kid

01:35:04.998 --> 01:35:06.431
to start a ranch.

01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:22.348
Hey.

01:35:22.415 --> 01:35:23.439
Hmm?

01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:30.155
I might go back
ahead of you.

01:35:36.563 --> 01:35:38.360
You mean home?

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.334
I was thinking of it.

01:35:47.873 --> 01:35:49.602
Whatever you want, Etta.

01:35:54.279 --> 01:35:55.712
Maybe I'll go.

01:36:05.357 --> 01:36:06.688
Hey.

01:36:06.759 --> 01:36:07.953
Hmm?

01:36:08.026 --> 01:36:09.459
Etta's thinking of, uh,

01:36:09.528 --> 01:36:11.655
maybe going home
ahead of us.

01:36:15.167 --> 01:36:16.725
Whatever she wants.

01:36:19.304 --> 01:36:20.737
I'll go, then.

01:36:59.011 --> 01:37:00.444
<i>¡Manos arriba!</i>

01:37:01.513 --> 01:37:02.946
How much you got?

01:37:03.015 --> 01:37:05.449
It's hardly worth it.
Alpoca mine.

01:37:05.517 --> 01:37:07.951
I tell you, no more
jungle work for me.

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:10.454
You're getting
to be an old maid.

01:37:10.522 --> 01:37:12.956
Keep your old maid
remarks to yourself.

01:37:13.025 --> 01:37:15.459
I'll work in the city,
in the mountains,

01:37:15.527 --> 01:37:18.155
but from now on
jungle work is out.

01:37:18.230 --> 01:37:19.162
<i>¿Bandidos yanquis?</i>

01:37:19.231 --> 01:37:20.289
Mm-hmm.

01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:23.434
Tell them to be quiet.

01:37:23.502 --> 01:37:24.935
What's the word?

01:37:25.003 --> 01:37:25.935
<i>Quietas.</i>

01:37:26.004 --> 01:37:26.936
<i>Quietas.</i>

01:37:36.915 --> 01:37:38.348
I tell you,

01:37:38.417 --> 01:37:40.851
the jungle's a better
cover for payrolls.

01:37:40.919 --> 01:37:43.353
Kid, I got a right
to my opinion,

01:37:43.422 --> 01:37:44.855
and in my opinion,

01:37:44.923 --> 01:37:46.356
there are snakes
in the jungle.

01:37:46.425 --> 01:37:47.983
I don't work
around snakes.

01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:49.493
What is this place?

01:37:50.796 --> 01:37:51.990
I don't know.

01:37:52.064 --> 01:37:53.725
San Vincente,
I think.

01:37:53.799 --> 01:37:54.731
<i>¿Comer?</i>

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:55.732
<i>Si, Señor.</i>

01:37:55.801 --> 01:37:57.234
<i>Pasen.
Juan, ven.</i>

01:37:57.302 --> 01:37:59.736
<i>Llévate los caballos.</i>

01:38:24.997 --> 01:38:27.431
I don't enjoy jungles.
I don't enjoy swamps.

01:38:27.499 --> 01:38:28.932
I don't like snakes.

01:38:29.001 --> 01:38:30.935
I don't much care
for night work.

01:38:31.003 --> 01:38:32.265
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

01:38:33.472 --> 01:38:34.439
<i>¡Capitán! ¡Capitán!</i>

01:38:34.506 --> 01:38:36.440
<i>Capitán,
allá en la plaza,</i>

01:38:36.508 --> 01:38:39.443
<i>hay una mula
de las minas de Alpoca.</i>

01:38:39.511 --> 01:38:40.944
<i>¿Las minas de Alpoca?</i>

01:38:41.013 --> 01:38:42.446
<i>Sí, sí. Allí están.</i>

01:38:42.514 --> 01:38:44.448
<i>Dos hombres la acaban
de traer.</i>

01:38:44.516 --> 01:38:46.211
<i>Están comiendo en el
restaurante de mi papá.</i>

01:38:46.285 --> 01:38:48.879
<i>El guisado
está delicioso.</i>

01:38:48.954 --> 01:38:51.388
<i>Para chuparse
los dedos.</i>

01:38:51.456 --> 01:38:54.391
<i>Si quieren mas, es
la especialidad de la casa,</i>

01:38:54.459 --> 01:38:55.892
<i>si quieren mas,</i>

01:38:55.961 --> 01:38:57.394
<i>no tengan pena
y díganmelo.</i>

01:38:57.462 --> 01:38:59.396
<i>Yo estoy aquí
para servirles.</i>

01:38:59.464 --> 01:39:04.424
<i>Agradezco la visita de tan
distinguidos caballeros.</i>

01:39:04.503 --> 01:39:05.435
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

01:39:05.504 --> 01:39:06.872
<i>Para servirles.</i>

01:39:07.005 --> 01:39:07.801
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

01:39:07.873 --> 01:39:08.805
<i>Sí.</i>

01:39:11.977 --> 01:39:13.911
The specialty
of the house,

01:39:13.979 --> 01:39:15.412
and it's
still moving.

01:39:22.454 --> 01:39:23.887
Well, that settles it.

01:39:23.955 --> 01:39:26.389
This place gets no more
of my business.

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:36.662
Hey.

01:39:36.735 --> 01:39:37.759
What?

01:39:37.836 --> 01:39:41.135
What do you think?
I bet it's just one guy.

01:39:49.614 --> 01:39:52.810
Don't you get sick of
being right all the time?

01:40:22.212 --> 01:40:23.509
Reloading.

01:40:26.717 --> 01:40:28.150
That's all I got.

01:40:32.122 --> 01:40:33.555
We're going to run out

01:40:33.624 --> 01:40:37.355
unless we can get to that
mule and get some more.

01:40:41.732 --> 01:40:43.063
I'll go.

01:40:43.133 --> 01:40:46.261
This is no time for bravery.
I'll let you.

01:40:48.605 --> 01:40:49.594
Loaded.

01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:57.777
Hell!

01:40:57.848 --> 01:41:00.282
I'm the one
that has to go.

01:41:01.719 --> 01:41:02.947
Why you?

01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:05.250
'Cause I could never
give you cover.

01:41:05.322 --> 01:41:07.256
You can cover me.

01:41:08.959 --> 01:41:11.951
You can see I'm right,
can't you?

01:41:19.136 --> 01:41:20.694
You go.

01:41:20.771 --> 01:41:23.467
Yeah, why am I always
so damn smart?

01:41:30.247 --> 01:41:31.179
Here.

01:41:39.323 --> 01:41:40.255
Go.

01:41:57.975 --> 01:41:58.907
O.K.

01:42:38.782 --> 01:42:39.714
Go.

01:43:40.577 --> 01:43:41.509
Ah!

01:44:25.454 --> 01:44:28.821
Is... Is that what you call
giving cover?

01:44:28.891 --> 01:44:31.826
Is that what
you call running?

01:44:31.894 --> 01:44:34.829
If I knew you were
going to stroll...

01:44:35.898 --> 01:44:37.331
You never could shoot,

01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:39.334
not from
the very beginning.

01:44:45.374 --> 01:44:47.308
And you are all mouth.

01:44:56.018 --> 01:44:57.849
<i>Jefe, llega el ejército.</i>

01:45:09.599 --> 01:45:10.531
<i>Mi capitán.</i>

01:45:12.335 --> 01:45:13.267
<i>¿Dónde están?</i>

01:45:13.336 --> 01:45:14.769
<i>Allí en la plaza.</i>

01:45:14.837 --> 01:45:16.202
<i>¿Cuántos hombres son?</i>

01:45:16.272 --> 01:45:17.204
<i>Dos hombres.</i>

01:45:17.273 --> 01:45:18.205
<i>¿Dos hombres?</i>

01:45:18.274 --> 01:45:19.707
<i>Mi capitán,
por favor...</i>

01:45:19.775 --> 01:45:20.707
<i>¿Dos?</i>

01:45:20.776 --> 01:45:21.970
<i>Bandidos yanquis.</i>

01:45:22.044 --> 01:45:23.477
<i>¿Bandidos yanquis, eh?</i>

01:45:23.546 --> 01:45:24.979
<i>Sí, mi capitán.</i>

01:45:25.047 --> 01:45:25.979
Hmm.

01:45:26.048 --> 01:45:27.481
<i>Sargento Rico,</i>

01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:29.017
<i>desmonten 20 hombres</i>

01:45:29.085 --> 01:45:30.985
<i>y vayan con el teniente.</i>

01:46:44.661 --> 01:46:47.596
I've got a great idea
where we should go next.

01:46:47.664 --> 01:46:49.598
I don't want
to hear it.

01:46:49.666 --> 01:46:51.099
You'll change your mind.

01:46:51.167 --> 01:46:52.099
Shut up!

01:46:52.168 --> 01:46:53.100
OK, O.K.

01:46:53.169 --> 01:46:54.602
Your ideas
got us here.

01:46:54.671 --> 01:46:55.763
Forget it!

01:46:55.839 --> 01:46:58.774
I never want to hear
another of your ideas.

01:46:58.842 --> 01:46:59.774
All right.

01:46:59.843 --> 01:47:00.775
O.K.

01:47:10.253 --> 01:47:11.481
Australia.

01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:17.257
I figured secretly
you wanted to know,

01:47:17.327 --> 01:47:18.760
so I told you.

01:47:18.828 --> 01:47:19.954
Australia.

01:47:21.698 --> 01:47:23.131
That's your great idea?

01:47:23.199 --> 01:47:25.133
Oh, boy,
it's the latest in...

01:47:25.201 --> 01:47:26.634
in a long line.

01:47:26.703 --> 01:47:28.637
Australia's
no better than here.

01:47:28.705 --> 01:47:30.138
Aw, that's all you know.

01:47:30.206 --> 01:47:31.639
Name me one thing.

01:47:31.708 --> 01:47:33.642
They speak English
in Australia.

01:47:33.710 --> 01:47:34.642
They do?

01:47:34.711 --> 01:47:36.144
That's right, smart guy.

01:47:36.212 --> 01:47:37.645
So we wouldn't be
foreigners.

01:47:39.082 --> 01:47:40.515
They got horses in Australia.

01:47:40.583 --> 01:47:44.019
They got thousands of miles
we could hide out in.

01:47:44.087 --> 01:47:46.021
And a good climate,
nice beaches.

01:47:46.089 --> 01:47:47.522
You could learn to swim.

01:47:47.590 --> 01:47:48.522
No!

01:47:48.591 --> 01:47:50.149
Swimming
isn't important.

01:47:52.962 --> 01:47:55.624
What about the banks?

01:47:55.698 --> 01:47:57.358
They're easy.

01:47:57.432 --> 01:47:59.093
Easy, ripe,
and luscious.

01:48:03.071 --> 01:48:05.005
The banks
or the women?

01:48:05.073 --> 01:48:08.008
Well, once you've got one,
you've got the other.

01:48:10.712 --> 01:48:12.646
It's a long way,
isn't it?

01:48:12.714 --> 01:48:15.148
Aw! Everything's
got to be perfect with you.

01:48:15.217 --> 01:48:17.082
I don't want
to get there

01:48:17.152 --> 01:48:18.585
and find out
it stinks.

01:48:18.654 --> 01:48:19.985
At least
think about it.

01:48:22.758 --> 01:48:23.952
All right.

01:48:25.327 --> 01:48:26.760
I'll think about it.

01:48:31.767 --> 01:48:32.699
Hey.

01:48:34.736 --> 01:48:36.226
When we get outside...

01:48:36.305 --> 01:48:38.739
and we get to the horses,

01:48:38.807 --> 01:48:40.240
just remember one thing.

01:48:44.313 --> 01:48:45.746
Hey, wait a minute.

01:48:45.814 --> 01:48:47.441
What?

01:48:47.516 --> 01:48:50.451
You didn't see LeFors
out there, did you?

01:48:50.519 --> 01:48:51.577
LeFors?

01:48:52.754 --> 01:48:54.688
No.

01:48:54.756 --> 01:48:56.883
Oh, good.

01:48:56.959 --> 01:48:58.392
For a moment there,

01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:00.894
I thought we were
in trouble.

01:49:06.935 --> 01:49:07.765
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

01:49:10.205 --> 01:49:11.229
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

01:49:14.376 --> 01:49:15.570
<i>¡Fuego!</i>
