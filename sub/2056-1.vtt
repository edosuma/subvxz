04:07.480 --> 04:09.007
It's time
to get out.

07:38.691 --> 07:40.591
Don't bleed
to death.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.099
- Hello, Mitchell.
- Bond.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.725
The Americans are gonna be
none too pleased about this.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.770
I promised them Le Chiffre,
and they got Le Chiffre.

07:51.871 --> 07:53.270
They got his body.

07:53.372 --> 07:57.433
If they'd wanted his soul, they should
have made a deal with a priest.

07:57.543 --> 07:59.909
- Has he said anything?
- No.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.812
I'm going to check the perimeter, ma'am.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.542
You look like hell.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.916
When's the last time you slept?

08:09.055 --> 08:10.886
Vesper's boyfriend, Yusef Kabira,

08:10.957 --> 08:14.222
the one who was abducted in Morocco,
the one she was trying to save.

08:14.293 --> 08:16.625
His body was washed up
on a beach in Ibiza.

08:16.729 --> 08:19.391
We're meant to believe
the fish did that to his face.

08:19.465 --> 08:21.262
His wallet and ID were in his pocket.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.063
- Well, that's convenient.
- Quite.

08:23.135 --> 08:27.299
Which is why I did a DNA check on a lock
of his hair found in Vesper's apartment.

08:27.406 --> 08:28.464
It's not him.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.269
A lock of his hair?

08:30.343 --> 08:33.140
I wouldn't have thought
Vesper the sentimental type.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.806
Well, we never really know anyone,
do we?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.644
But I do need to know, Bond.

08:40.019 --> 08:42.647
I need to know that I can trust you.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.581
And you don't?

08:44.657 --> 08:46.022
Well, it'd be a pretty cold bastard

08:46.125 --> 08:48.992
who didn't want revenge
for the death of someone he loved.

08:49.095 --> 08:51.154
You don't have to worry about me.

08:51.264 --> 08:54.495
I'm not gonna go chasing him.
He's not important.

08:56.769 --> 08:58.498
And neither was she.

08:59.505 --> 09:00.836
It's clear, ma'am.

09:00.940 --> 09:03.170
- Thanks, Mitchell.
- Shall we?

09:22.361 --> 09:24.989
Are you gonna tell us who you work for?

09:25.064 --> 09:28.295
I was always very interested to meet you.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.733
I'd heard so much about you from Vesper.

09:30.836 --> 09:33.964
The real shame is that
if she hadn't killed herself,

09:34.040 --> 09:35.974
we would have had you, too.

09:36.042 --> 09:39.375
I think you would have done
anything for her.

09:39.478 --> 09:42.970
Well, you know you're not in Britain,
and God knows where you'll be tomorrow.

09:43.049 --> 09:44.482
Which should tell you that eventually

09:44.550 --> 09:47.678
you will tell us about
the people you work with,

09:47.753 --> 09:51.348
and the longer it takes,
the more painful we'll make it.

09:53.693 --> 09:56.560
You really don't know anything about us.

10:00.366 --> 10:04.200
It's so amusing because
we are on the other side, thinking,

10:04.270 --> 10:07.000
"The Ml6, the CIA,
they're looking over our shoulders.

10:07.073 --> 10:08.870
"They're listening to our conversations."

10:08.941 --> 10:12.069
And the truth is
you don't even know we exist.

10:12.178 --> 10:15.614
Well, we do now, Mr. White,
and we're quick learners.

10:17.183 --> 10:18.673
Oh, really?

10:19.719 --> 10:21.949
Well, then, the first thing
you should know about us

10:22.054 --> 10:24.545
is that we have people everywhere.

10:25.391 --> 10:26.756
Am I right?

15:41.373 --> 15:42.704
Anything?

15:43.709 --> 15:46.200
Craig Mitchell worked for me
for eight years.

15:46.278 --> 15:49.736
He passed a full security check
and lie detector test every year.

15:49.848 --> 15:52.442
Didn't leave so much as a scrap of
paper to explain any of it.

15:52.551 --> 15:55.520
Eight years!
Five as my personal bodyguard.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.919
I found this and three other
bloody Christmas presents

15:58.023 --> 15:59.217
I bought him about the house.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.781
I don't think he smoked.

16:01.393 --> 16:02.860
And you had to kill him.

16:02.928 --> 16:06.125
Couldn't bring him in for questioning so
that we might actually learn something.

16:06.231 --> 16:09.394
When someone says we got people everywhere,
you expect it to be hyperbole.

16:09.468 --> 16:12.460
Lots of people say that.
Florists use that expression.

16:12.571 --> 16:16.405
Doesn't mean that they've got somebody
working for them inside the bloody room.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.739
What the hell is this organization, Bond?

16:18.811 --> 16:22.440
How can they be everywhere
and we know nothing about them?

16:23.482 --> 16:26.451
- I assume we found no trace of White.
- No.

16:26.552 --> 16:27.814
The agent guarding the door in the garage

16:27.920 --> 16:29.785
was dead before you passed him
on the stairs.

16:29.888 --> 16:31.651
I passed him on the stairs? Christ!

16:31.757 --> 16:34.624
Mitchell must have killed him when he
went out to check the perimeter.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.422
You're lucky to be here.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.053
Do you think White's still alive?

16:38.130 --> 16:39.927
- Yes, I do.
- What is it?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.899
Craig Mitchell, 45 years old.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.401
No living family.
Gave generously to charity.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.233
Tell me you know more than that.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.899
Our moneymen went through
every bill in Mitchell's wallet and house.

16:48.974 --> 16:52.000
- How much did he have?
- Less than 100 pounds,

16:52.111 --> 16:54.079
and about the same in euros and dollars.

16:54.146 --> 16:55.636
Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.

16:55.748 --> 16:59.013
We've done a complete forensic analysis
of every note and its traceable history.

16:59.118 --> 17:00.779
Not in the mood.

17:02.521 --> 17:03.920
After you.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.691
This particular note from
Mitchell's wallet may be of interest.

17:06.791 --> 17:07.816
<i>Scanning.</i>

17:07.925 --> 17:10.917
We introduced tagged bills into
Le Chiffre's money-laundering operation

17:10.996 --> 17:13.156
by intercepting illegal payoffs.

17:13.265 --> 17:16.257
We traced money through several of
his bank accounts around the world.

17:16.335 --> 17:17.597
That's pretty thin.

17:17.669 --> 17:18.863
At the rate money changes hands,

17:18.971 --> 17:21.098
you could probably find a tenner
in my wallet with a tag.

17:21.173 --> 17:23.266
That's true, ma'am.
A single bill could be a coincidence,

17:23.342 --> 17:25.105
but what about a whole stack?

17:25.176 --> 17:27.441
These bills,
from the same series as Mitchell's,

17:27.512 --> 17:30.505
were just scanned at a bank
in Port-au-Prince, Haiti,

17:30.616 --> 17:33.483
deposited in the account of a Mr. Slate.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.179
Impress me.

17:35.287 --> 17:37.346
We have a Mr. Edmund Slate
returning to Port-au-Prince

17:37.456 --> 17:39.549
from Heathrow this morning.

17:39.658 --> 17:43.389
His entry documents have him staying
at the Hotel Dessalines.

17:43.495 --> 17:45.326
He's in room 325.

17:54.873 --> 17:57.000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.638
Do you have any messages for 325?

20:09.808 --> 20:11.969
No, sir.
The only message was about the briefcase

20:12.044 --> 20:13.534
that was delivered earlier.

20:13.645 --> 20:16.478
- Did you want us to continue holding it?
- No. No, I'll take that now.

20:16.548 --> 20:17.845
Yes, sir.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.848
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:31.463 --> 20:32.691
Get in!

20:33.298 --> 20:34.959
- What?
- Get in.

20:37.803 --> 20:38.997
All right.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.700
You're late.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.834
I got pulled into a meeting.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.344
Who with?

20:47.412 --> 20:49.505
A friend of Mr. White's.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.376
Don't think I know him.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.314
It's funny.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.357
You don't look at all like I expected.

20:59.691 --> 21:01.659
Really? What were you expecting?

21:01.727 --> 21:04.195
I didn't think geologists looked so...

21:04.263 --> 21:05.423
So?

21:08.734 --> 21:10.725
A friend of yours?

21:10.836 --> 21:12.861
I don't have any friends.

21:19.878 --> 21:22.176
Get out of the way! Move!

21:34.059 --> 21:35.959
We didn't settle on a price.

21:36.061 --> 21:37.722
Make me an offer.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.459
We can work it out later, over drinks.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.731
Dominic didn't give you any trouble,
did he?

21:46.805 --> 21:48.067
No.

21:52.544 --> 21:54.444
What the hell is this?

21:54.546 --> 21:57.037
I think someone wants to kill you.

22:03.221 --> 22:05.121
That wasn't very nice.

22:08.260 --> 22:11.423
- You were supposed to shoot her.
- Well, I missed.

22:22.107 --> 22:23.472
Get Bond.

22:24.776 --> 22:28.109
- Where is he now?
- Approaching the docks, Kings Quay.

22:31.416 --> 22:33.111
<i>- Connecting.</i>
<i>- Tanner.</i>

22:33.185 --> 22:34.243
I've got Bond.

22:34.319 --> 22:35.445
Ask him about Slate.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.147
<i>She wants to know about Slate.</i>

22:37.255 --> 22:38.813
Tell her Slate was a dead end.

22:38.924 --> 22:39.982
Slate was a dead end.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.320
<i>Connection terminated.</i>

22:41.426 --> 22:43.121
Damn him. He killed him.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.162
Touch me and I'll break your wrist.

23:29.508 --> 23:30.805
Camille.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.675
How nice to see you.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.873
Alive, you mean?

23:37.182 --> 23:40.208
I knew we shouldn't have slept together.

23:40.318 --> 23:42.718
I think I'm starting to like you.

23:42.821 --> 23:45.585
So you did just try and have me killed.

23:46.525 --> 23:50.484
And that made me very sad
thinking I would never see you again.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.193
But here you are.

23:53.265 --> 23:56.098
Damn it, Dominic!
I was trying to help you.

23:59.604 --> 24:02.038
I was trying to uncover a leak.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.268
And you, you sent someone to kill me?

24:04.376 --> 24:07.243
Please don't talk to me like I'm stupid!

24:08.880 --> 24:10.541
It's unattractive.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.613
Come. I wanna show you something.

24:17.722 --> 24:18.882
Come.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.619
There's nothing that makes me
more uncomfortable

24:21.726 --> 24:24.126
than friends talking behind my back.

24:24.229 --> 24:25.890
It feels like

24:26.731 --> 24:28.699
ants under my skin.

24:29.634 --> 24:32.102
It's been that way forever.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.229
I remember when I was 15,

24:34.873 --> 24:38.365
I had a crush on
one of my mother's piano students.

24:39.077 --> 24:43.741
Somehow I overheard her saying
very nasty things about me.

24:44.983 --> 24:46.746
I got so angry.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.715
I took an iron.

24:53.124 --> 24:54.557
Is that him?

24:55.427 --> 24:57.895
I... We only spoke on the phone.

25:00.499 --> 25:04.128
It's such a shame
because he's one of my best geologists.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.570
He said you asked to buy information.

25:08.673 --> 25:11.972
No. He called me
and offered to sell me information.

25:14.079 --> 25:16.980
Why would I come back here
if I was lying?

25:17.816 --> 25:19.249
Because you love me.

25:19.317 --> 25:21.444
I was doing it for you.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.954
To stop him from betraying you.

25:25.657 --> 25:29.093
You know what burns more
than all your bullshit?

25:29.928 --> 25:33.364
Is that I always got the feeling
that you were only sleeping with me

25:33.465 --> 25:35.626
to get to General Medrano.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.294
Is that him?

25:40.138 --> 25:43.198
You know how these
deposed dictators are,

25:43.308 --> 25:45.333
jealous of their safety.

25:47.312 --> 25:48.870
Stick around.

25:49.648 --> 25:51.445
I'll introduce you.

25:53.485 --> 25:55.112
Do you see the girl
that just walked in here?

25:55.186 --> 25:58.280
Could you give her that?
Tell her to call me.

26:16.541 --> 26:21.001
<i>You've reached Universal Exports.</i>
<i>Our offices are currently closed.</i>

26:28.753 --> 26:31.153
And you can do all this for me?

26:32.157 --> 26:35.149
Well, look at what we
did to this country.

26:35.226 --> 26:36.659
The Haitians elect a priest

26:36.728 --> 26:41.358
who decides to raise the minimum wage
from 38 cents to $1 a day.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.036
It's not a lot,
but it's enough to upset the corporations

26:45.103 --> 26:48.561
who were here making T-shirts
and running shoes.

26:48.673 --> 26:52.734
So they called us,
and we facilitated a change.

26:52.844 --> 26:53.902
The difference is,

26:54.012 --> 26:58.176
my country's not some flyspeck
in the middle of the Caribbean.

26:58.249 --> 27:01.685
But we've already begun
destabilizing the government.

27:01.753 --> 27:04.187
We'll supply the private security.

27:04.255 --> 27:06.416
We'll pay off the right officials,

27:06.524 --> 27:10.460
and we have 26 countries
ready to officially recognize

27:10.562 --> 27:13.030
your new Bolivian government.

27:14.032 --> 27:16.262
You want your country back.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.968
My organization can give it to you
within the week.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.701
You've been busy.

27:24.075 --> 27:26.543
And in return you want what?

27:27.712 --> 27:29.111
A desert.

27:36.221 --> 27:38.781
- This part.
- This land is worthless.

27:40.759 --> 27:42.784
So you're getting a great deal.

27:42.894 --> 27:44.828
You won't find oil there.

27:44.929 --> 27:46.954
Everyone has tried.

27:47.065 --> 27:49.397
Maybe, maybe not.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.236
But we own whatever we find.

28:00.745 --> 28:03.612
Did you know Ernesto Montes?

28:03.682 --> 28:06.116
A very powerful man in his day.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.652
He had a beautiful Russian wife.

28:09.587 --> 28:10.918
A dancer.

28:11.756 --> 28:14.190
Well, his daughter works for me.

28:14.793 --> 28:16.090
Or did.

28:16.761 --> 28:18.251
She's lovely,

28:18.797 --> 28:20.924
but I don't see the resemblance.

28:20.999 --> 28:24.799
Why don't you consider her
as something to sweeten the deal?

28:27.706 --> 28:31.642
Just promise me to drop her
over the side when you're done.

28:33.278 --> 28:35.940
Camille, General Medrano.

28:51.796 --> 28:54.560
Be careful what you wish for, my dear.

29:03.808 --> 29:05.070
Have fun, you two.

30:24.255 --> 30:25.279
What the hell are you doing?

30:25.390 --> 30:27.415
- You're welcome!
- You idiot! Take me back!

30:27.492 --> 30:30.086
You know, maybe I'll do that later.

30:33.598 --> 30:35.759
You're not one of Greene's.

30:36.935 --> 30:38.493
Dominic Greene?

30:42.073 --> 30:43.404
Get down!

31:08.266 --> 31:10.496
- Give me the wheel!
- Navigate!

31:16.608 --> 31:17.700
Left!

31:28.720 --> 31:30.950
- What are you doing?
- Hold on!

31:47.805 --> 31:49.136
Get down!

33:08.920 --> 33:10.410
Excuse me.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.649
Thank you. She's seasick.

33:45.256 --> 33:46.689
It's Bond.

33:46.791 --> 33:48.850
- Connect Bond.
<i>- Connecting 007.</i>

33:48.960 --> 33:49.984
Yes?

33:50.094 --> 33:52.255
Name check, Dominic Greene.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.127
<i>G- R-E-E-N-E.</i>

33:56.768 --> 33:57.792
I might need a little more than that.

33:57.869 --> 33:58.927
There are a lot of Dominic Greenes.

33:59.003 --> 34:00.994
Do you have a social security
or passport number?

34:01.105 --> 34:02.367
No.

34:02.473 --> 34:03.804
<i>Scanning DGSE databases.</i>

34:03.875 --> 34:06.844
<i>- Anything?</i>
<i>- Scanning KGB databases.</i>

34:06.944 --> 34:09.139
Do you have anything?
Will you put her on, please?

34:09.213 --> 34:11.806
I am on, Bond. What happened to Slate?

34:11.882 --> 34:13.110
I'm not dwelling on the past.

34:13.184 --> 34:15.311
- I don't think you should, either.
- You killed him.

34:15.386 --> 34:18.378
Largest hit, Dominic Greene,
CEO of Greene Planet.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.353
It's a utility company,

34:20.425 --> 34:22.893
but Greene's been doing
a lot of philanthropic work,

34:22.994 --> 34:25.724
buying up large tracts of land
for ecological preserves.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.822
<i>You should be getting
his picture now.</i>

34:28.900 --> 34:30.527
Yep, that's him.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.264
I'm afraid there's a firewall
around his other corporate holdings,

34:33.371 --> 34:34.565
so we have no other information.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.105
Get me the Americans.

34:36.206 --> 34:37.606
<i>Connecting.</i>

34:37.708 --> 34:38.732
<i>Go ahead.</i>

34:38.842 --> 34:41.505
Interest in Dominic Greene,
Greene Planet.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.342
<i>Transferring you now.</i>

34:45.248 --> 34:47.513
<i>Hold for Gregory Beam, please.</i>

34:48.418 --> 34:49.443
<i>Thank you.</i>

34:49.554 --> 34:51.454
<i>Hi, this is Gregory Beam, ma 'am.</i>

34:51.556 --> 34:53.183
Hello, Mr. Beam.

34:53.257 --> 34:56.851
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
We have no interest in Mr. Greene.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.361
Thank you, Mr. Beam.

34:58.429 --> 34:59.521
<i>Connection terminated.</i>

34:59.597 --> 35:01.360
He's a person of extreme interest.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.866
- But he just said that he wasn't...
- Tanner, I asked about the man

35:03.935 --> 35:06.563
and she transferred me
to the section chief of South America.

35:06.637 --> 35:08.867
How would she know to do that
if they weren't tracking him?

35:14.212 --> 35:16.646
<i>Bond, we have your location</i>
<i>as approaching an airfield.</i>

35:16.747 --> 35:18.578
<i>- Is Greene on the move?</i>
- Yeah.

35:18.649 --> 35:21.880
I've got a tail number,
Golf-Zero-Charlie-Sierra-Charlie.

35:21.953 --> 35:22.977
<i>Get me a destination.</i>

35:26.724 --> 35:28.214
It's a private charter

35:28.292 --> 35:31.386
going to Bregenz, Austria,
leaving immediately.

35:31.929 --> 35:34.557
Tanner, authorize a charter for 007.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.163
And, Bond, if you could avoid killing
every possible lead,

35:39.270 --> 35:40.464
it would be deeply appreciated.

35:41.005 --> 35:43.235
Yes, ma'am. I'll do my best.

35:43.774 --> 35:45.401
<i>Connection terminated.</i>

35:45.476 --> 35:46.738
I've heard that before.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.111
- Hello.
- Hi.

35:51.582 --> 35:53.174
Welcome aboard.

35:56.420 --> 35:58.183
Come. Have a seat.

35:58.923 --> 36:01.016
Charlie-Sierra-Charlie.

36:16.274 --> 36:17.434
Jeez.

36:17.942 --> 36:19.273
Sorry.

36:22.947 --> 36:24.812
How much longer?

36:26.984 --> 36:29.043
So do we have an understanding?

36:30.154 --> 36:31.178
Yeah.

36:31.289 --> 36:33.655
We do nothing to stop a coup in Bolivia,
and in exchange,

36:33.724 --> 36:38.218
the new government gives America
the lease to any oil found.

36:39.664 --> 36:41.655
If it's oil you want.

36:42.700 --> 36:45.567
Well, you didn't find diamonds, did you?

36:51.075 --> 36:54.636
Drilling underground, you kept off
everybody's radar for a very long time,

36:54.712 --> 36:58.876
but you can't buy that much piping
without somebody getting curious.

36:59.984 --> 37:01.975
We'll have to verify the find.

37:02.053 --> 37:06.490
I'm not even admitting there is one.
You are getting this for free.

37:07.491 --> 37:10.324
Venezuela, Brazil, now Bolivia.

37:10.394 --> 37:15.058
With you tied up in the Middle East,
South America is falling like dominoes.

37:16.500 --> 37:21.335
You don't need another Marxist giving
national resources to the people, do you?

37:22.006 --> 37:24.031
Well, we can hardly be expected
to do something about a coup

37:24.108 --> 37:26.042
we know nothing about.

37:29.513 --> 37:31.674
And I have a pest.

37:33.351 --> 37:34.511
This.

37:37.722 --> 37:40.190
You have any idea who that is?

37:50.268 --> 37:51.599
Sorry.

37:54.038 --> 37:56.768
It's James Bond, British Secret Service.

37:57.742 --> 38:00.643
I don't know how I
could have missed that.

38:02.213 --> 38:04.977
I will need you to get rid of him for me.

38:05.082 --> 38:07.710
Yeah. That's not gonna be a problem.

38:24.502 --> 38:26.663
You know who Greene is
and you wanna put us in bed with him.

38:26.771 --> 38:28.739
You are kidding, right?

38:28.806 --> 38:32.139
Yeah. You're right.
We should just deal with nice people.

38:32.243 --> 38:34.939
I need to know you're on the team, Felix.

38:35.012 --> 38:37.606
I need to know you value your career.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.848
Dominic Greene.

40:10.574 --> 40:12.371
- Good to see you. Good.
- How are you?

40:12.443 --> 40:13.876
Thank you.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.804
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

40:50.915 --> 40:54.373
<i>tonight's performance</i> of Tosca
<i>will begin shortly.</i>

40:54.452 --> 40:56.443
<i>Please take your seats.</i>

41:51.041 --> 41:53.805
<i>What else does General
Medrano require?</i>

42:15.966 --> 42:18.400
<i>Anything further</i>
<i>from Canadian intelligence?</i>

42:18.502 --> 42:20.561
<i>We'll discuss that later.</i>

42:21.071 --> 42:23.437
<i>How much more pipeline do we need?</i>

42:23.541 --> 42:26.066
Ideally, 2,000 kilometers.

42:26.544 --> 42:28.603
<i>Are there any objections?</i>

42:29.747 --> 42:30.771
<i>No.</i>

42:30.881 --> 42:32.212
<i>Not here.</i>

42:32.283 --> 42:33.682
<i>No objections.</i>

42:34.351 --> 42:37.514
Transfer the funds
from our Siberian holdings.

42:37.588 --> 42:38.885
<i>Done.</i>

42:42.426 --> 42:44.417
Where do the Americans stand?

42:44.528 --> 42:48.897
Well, the CIA doesn't care about another
dictator as long as they get their end.

42:48.966 --> 42:51.526
But when they find out
that they've been duped?

42:51.602 --> 42:53.570
I'm working on that.

42:53.637 --> 42:57.266
<i>I'm still not sure that the Tierra Project</i>
<i>is the best use of Quantum 's time.</i>

42:57.374 --> 42:59.740
<i>Perhaps we should shift</i>
<i>our focus to the Canadian.</i>

42:59.810 --> 43:02.540
<i>This is the world's</i>
<i>most precious resource.</i>

43:02.613 --> 43:05.878
<i>We need to control as much</i>
<i>of it as we can.</i>

43:05.950 --> 43:08.214
Bolivia must be top priority.

43:08.285 --> 43:10.219
Can I offer an opinion?

43:12.556 --> 43:16.458
I really think you people
should find a better place to meet.

43:22.099 --> 43:24.659
Where do you think you're going?

43:45.322 --> 43:46.914
Thank you.

43:56.834 --> 43:59.268
Well, <i>Tosca</i> isn't for everyone.

45:13.243 --> 45:14.676
Drop it.

45:18.215 --> 45:20.513
So who are you working for?

45:20.584 --> 45:21.846
Piss off.

45:22.186 --> 45:26.213
Get rid of anything we brought with us.
We've been compromised.

45:29.226 --> 45:31.922
I asked you who you were working for.

45:43.874 --> 45:46.274
- Is he one of ours?
- No.

45:46.376 --> 45:48.936
Then he shouldn't be looking at me.

45:57.588 --> 45:59.078
Get me M.

46:00.557 --> 46:01.888
It's your line.

46:01.959 --> 46:04.393
Thanks. Connect call.

46:04.461 --> 46:05.928
<i>Connecting Tanner.</i>

46:05.996 --> 46:07.463
<i>We've ID'd the pictures.</i>

46:07.564 --> 46:08.826
Show me.

46:08.932 --> 46:13.596
Gregor Karakov, former minister,
now owns most of the mines in Siberia,

46:13.670 --> 46:17.333
<i>Moishe Soref, former Mossad,</i>
<i>now telecom giant,</i>

46:17.441 --> 46:20.239
<i>and Guy Haines, special envoy</i>
<i>to the Prime Minister.</i>

46:20.310 --> 46:21.572
Get Bond.

46:21.645 --> 46:23.408
There's something else.

46:23.480 --> 46:27.576
<i>It appears Bond shot Haines'
bodyguard and threw him off a roof.</i>

46:31.622 --> 46:33.419
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Did you get my pictures?

46:33.490 --> 46:35.788
Was this a conversation?
Can you link these people?

46:35.859 --> 46:37.258
<i>Is that stress in your voice?</i>

46:37.327 --> 46:38.851
I need you to come in and debrief.

46:38.962 --> 46:42.125
- I don't have time.
<i>- Bond, you killed a man in Bregenz.</i>

46:42.199 --> 46:43.427
I did my best not to.

46:43.500 --> 46:45.365
<i>You shot him at point blank</i>
<i>and threw him off a roof.</i>

46:45.469 --> 46:47.437
I'd hardly call that showing restraint,

46:47.504 --> 46:49.335
especially since he was
a member of Special Branch.

46:53.477 --> 46:54.637
So who was he guarding?

46:54.711 --> 46:55.769
Bond, are you missing the fact

46:55.846 --> 46:57.336
that you killed a member
of Special Branch?

46:57.447 --> 46:59.381
I need you to come in.

46:59.483 --> 47:03.613
And I would, but right now I need to find
the man who tried to kill you.

47:03.687 --> 47:04.847
<i>Go back to sleep.</i>

47:04.955 --> 47:06.217
<i>Connection terminated.</i>

47:06.323 --> 47:07.722
Restrict Bond's movements.

47:07.825 --> 47:09.452
Cancel his cards.

47:09.526 --> 47:11.289
Put an alert on his passports.
All of them.

47:11.361 --> 47:13.625
And I want to know everything
we don't know about Haines.

47:13.697 --> 47:14.721
<i>Yes, ma 'am.</i>

47:14.832 --> 47:17.960
And, Tanner,
be careful who you trust with this.

47:18.035 --> 47:20.401
Hopefully, you're a better judge
of character than I am.

47:22.005 --> 47:24.473
You want to follow your friends
to La Paz, Bolivia?

47:24.541 --> 47:25.803
Please.

47:28.212 --> 47:29.804
I'm sorry, sir, but this doesn't work.

47:29.880 --> 47:32.212
Do you have another card?

47:32.316 --> 47:33.476
No.

47:38.889 --> 47:40.880
Could you do me a favor?

47:40.991 --> 47:42.822
You're gonna get a
phone call in a minute.

47:42.893 --> 47:46.329
Would you mind telling them
I'm headed for Cairo?

47:46.396 --> 47:48.762
- I'd be happy to.
- Thank you.

48:28.772 --> 48:30.103
Mathis.

48:30.908 --> 48:32.773
What do you want?

48:32.876 --> 48:34.537
Come to apologize?

48:36.947 --> 48:38.710
You know, Mathis,

48:39.249 --> 48:41.479
I think retirement suits you.

48:42.252 --> 48:43.776
None for him.

48:44.388 --> 48:46.652
Sorry. He's in a bad mood today.

49:10.180 --> 49:12.410
I need a passport
and matching credit cards.

49:13.317 --> 49:15.512
And Ml6 ran out of plastic?

49:16.920 --> 49:19.582
Well, oddly, right now,
you're the only person I think I can trust.

49:19.656 --> 49:21.351
That is odd.

49:21.458 --> 49:23.289
But I guess when one's young,

49:23.360 --> 49:27.091
it seems very easy to distinguish
between right and wrong.

49:27.164 --> 49:30.133
But as one gets older,
it becomes more difficult.

49:30.200 --> 49:33.192
The villains and the heroes
get all mixed up.

49:34.171 --> 49:36.605
I was sorry to hear about Vesper.

49:37.107 --> 49:38.972
I think she loved you.

49:40.110 --> 49:42.442
Right up until the moment
she betrayed me.

49:43.347 --> 49:45.008
She died for you.

49:47.117 --> 49:49.483
Why did you really want to see me?

49:51.121 --> 49:53.055
I need some information.

49:57.194 --> 50:01.460
You have some hard friends.
This man is some kind of facilitator.

50:01.531 --> 50:04.898
Fingers in many pies,
and they don't leave any prints.

50:05.002 --> 50:08.631
- These men were together?
- They're buying up oil pipeline.

50:08.705 --> 50:10.195
Something called the Tierra Project.

50:10.307 --> 50:12.673
- Do you know it?
- Destroy these.

50:12.743 --> 50:15.143
That's Guy Haines. You don't know him?

50:15.212 --> 50:17.146
- Should I?
- I suppose not.

50:17.214 --> 50:20.274
You haven't been keeping
secrets as long as I have.

50:20.384 --> 50:22.352
He keeps a very low profile,

50:22.419 --> 50:26.082
but he's one of the Prime Minister's
closest advisors.

50:26.189 --> 50:29.750
Well, they say you're judged
by the strength of your enemies.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.953
Do you know anything about Bolivia?

50:32.062 --> 50:35.259
I was stationed in South America
for seven years.

50:35.365 --> 50:38.198
- Well, do you have some contacts there?
- A few.

50:38.635 --> 50:40.762
What do you want to know?

50:41.638 --> 50:43.105
Come with me.

51:13.837 --> 51:15.600
You can't sleep?

51:16.173 --> 51:18.004
May I fix you a drink, sir?

51:18.108 --> 51:20.008
What are you drinking?

51:20.777 --> 51:22.802
I don't know. What am I drinking?

51:22.913 --> 51:26.349
Three measures of Gordon's gin,
one of vodka, half of...

51:26.450 --> 51:29.476
- Kina Lillet.
- Kina Lillet, which is not Vermouth,

51:29.586 --> 51:31.281
shaken well until it is ice-cold,

51:31.354 --> 51:34.653
then served
with a large thin slice of lemon peel.

51:35.192 --> 51:36.682
Six of them.

51:37.027 --> 51:38.688
That's impressive.

51:38.795 --> 51:41.195
They're good. You should have one.

51:41.298 --> 51:43.789
No, it'll just keep me awake.

51:48.205 --> 51:50.537
So what's keeping you awake?

51:53.276 --> 51:55.938
I was wondering why you came with me.

51:57.547 --> 52:00.778
It takes something
to admit you were wrong.

52:03.787 --> 52:06.153
- You want a sleeping pill?
- No.

52:06.223 --> 52:07.850
- Pain pill?
- No.

52:07.958 --> 52:10.051
I have pills for everything.

52:10.560 --> 52:12.528
Some make you taller.

52:13.630 --> 52:15.495
Some make you forget.

52:18.802 --> 52:21.236
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

52:21.338 --> 52:22.669
Good idea.

52:37.654 --> 52:39.053
Thank you.

52:39.523 --> 52:42.515
Mr. Bond, my name is Fields.
I'm from the consulate.

52:42.592 --> 52:43.650
Well, of course you are.

52:43.727 --> 52:45.024
And what do you do
at the consulate, Fields?

52:45.095 --> 52:46.392
That's not important.

52:46.496 --> 52:47.724
My orders are to turn you around

52:47.831 --> 52:49.856
and put you on the first plane
back to London.

52:49.933 --> 52:52.697
Do those orders include my friend Mathis?

52:52.769 --> 52:54.498
I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.

52:54.571 --> 52:57.734
You see that? Gone such a short time
and already forgotten.

52:57.841 --> 52:59.502
You're just saying that to hurt me.

52:59.609 --> 53:02.737
Mr. Bond, these orders come from
the highest possible authority.

53:02.846 --> 53:05.781
Taxi.
Fields, when is the next flight to London?

53:05.882 --> 53:07.281
Tomorrow morning.

53:07.384 --> 53:08.408
Well then, we have all night.

53:08.518 --> 53:10.042
If you attempt to flee,
I will arrest you,

53:10.120 --> 53:12.588
drop you off in jail
and take you to the plane in chains.

53:12.689 --> 53:15.180
- Understand?
- Perfectly. After you.

53:17.194 --> 53:20.027
- I think she has handcuffs.
- I do hope so.

53:28.805 --> 53:30.636
He blames the water shortage
on global warming.

53:31.942 --> 53:33.034
Hello, Carlos? Carlos.

53:37.814 --> 53:39.372
The Colonel who heads
the National Police.

54:04.741 --> 54:06.732
We have a reservation.

54:07.577 --> 54:09.067
<i>- Cómo está?</i>
- Very well, thank you.

54:09.145 --> 54:11.511
- Your name?
- Miss Fields.

54:16.253 --> 54:18.153
- You're going nowhere.
- So shoot me.

54:18.255 --> 54:19.279
I'd rather stay in a morgue.

54:19.356 --> 54:22.587
We are teachers on sabbatical.
This fits our cover.

54:22.659 --> 54:25.423
No, it doesn't. Get in. Get in!

54:51.821 --> 54:53.482
Follow me, please.

55:01.131 --> 55:03.691
- May I show you your room, <i>señor?</i>
- No, it's fine. Thank you.

55:21.651 --> 55:23.812
I can't find the...

55:24.587 --> 55:26.214
The stationery.

55:27.090 --> 55:29.285
Will you come and help me look?

55:43.540 --> 55:45.735
You've been invited to a party.

55:45.842 --> 55:48.436
I didn't know we had any friends here.

55:49.512 --> 55:51.002
Greene Planet.

55:52.215 --> 55:53.239
You're not coming?

55:53.350 --> 55:55.511
I'm having a drink
with my friend the Colonel.

55:55.585 --> 55:57.917
I'll see you there later.

56:02.859 --> 56:05.555
Do you know how angry I am at myself?

56:06.062 --> 56:07.859
I can't imagine.

56:10.567 --> 56:12.467
You must be furious.

56:19.042 --> 56:21.272
Do you want to go to a party?

56:21.911 --> 56:23.139
A party?

56:23.980 --> 56:26.107
But I have nothing to wear.

56:26.549 --> 56:27.573
We'll fix that.

56:47.237 --> 56:49.569
It might be useful to
know your real name.

56:49.639 --> 56:51.072
Fields.

56:53.676 --> 56:55.166
Just Fields.

56:56.179 --> 56:57.806
Fields it is, then.

56:57.914 --> 57:01.680
<i>We are in a spiral</i>
<i>of environmental decline.</i>

57:02.786 --> 57:08.918
<i>Since 1945, 17% of the
planet's vegetated surface</i>

57:08.992 --> 57:11.859
<i>has been irreversibly degraded.</i>

57:12.629 --> 57:18.033
<i>The Tierra Project is just one small part</i>
<i>of a global network of Eco Parks</i>

57:18.134 --> 57:20.159
<i>that Greene Planet has created</i>

57:20.270 --> 57:24.673
<i>to rejuvenate a world</i>
<i>on the verge of collapse.</i>

57:26.443 --> 57:30.607
<i>I hope that tonight you make
the decision to be part of that.</i>

57:32.649 --> 57:33.980
<i>Thank you.</i>

57:38.288 --> 57:39.778
<i>And have fun.</i>

57:40.323 --> 57:42.518
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

57:43.293 --> 57:45.318
Excellent speech and congratulations.

57:45.395 --> 57:47.522
Wonderful speech, Dominic.

57:47.630 --> 57:49.530
- We need you here.
- Thank you.

57:49.632 --> 57:52.897
Miss Fields, Mr. Bond, my friend Carlos.

57:53.002 --> 57:54.833
- Pleased to meet you.
- Ma'am.

57:55.905 --> 57:58.897
Mr. Bond, Mathis has spoken
a great deal about you.

57:59.008 --> 58:02.876
I want you to know my entire
police force is at your disposal.

58:03.246 --> 58:04.679
Well, that could be very useful.

58:04.747 --> 58:08.012
You know, there are people in this
country spending half their paycheck

58:08.084 --> 58:09.574
just to get clean water.

58:09.686 --> 58:10.710
What do you think of that?

58:10.820 --> 58:12.879
The Bolivian government is the problem.

58:12.989 --> 58:14.581
They cut down the trees,

58:14.691 --> 58:18.855
then act surprised when the water
and the soil wash out to sea.

58:18.928 --> 58:22.420
I couldn't agree more.
I hope this figure is to your liking.

58:22.532 --> 58:24.898
<i>Chéri,</i> you shouldn't tease.

58:25.001 --> 58:29.028
Why don't you tell them about all
the land you bought up outside Potosí?

58:29.105 --> 58:31.335
It's been a pleasure. Will you excuse me?

58:31.407 --> 58:32.738
Of course.

58:32.842 --> 58:33.934
Somehow the logging rights

58:34.043 --> 58:38.173
went to a multinational corporation
that cut down the forests,

58:38.248 --> 58:42.947
but only after our last government
sold the land to Greene Planet.

58:44.888 --> 58:48.289
- Or have I got my facts crossed?
- Yes, I think you did.

58:49.058 --> 58:50.958
You'll excuse us?

58:51.728 --> 58:53.696
What a wonderful night.

58:56.966 --> 58:59.594
You just cost me
quite a bit of money, darling.

58:59.702 --> 59:02.364
You can't put a price on integrity.

59:02.472 --> 59:03.803
I can try.

59:09.546 --> 59:10.877
Thank you.

59:10.947 --> 59:14.906
Tell me you didn't drop by tonight
just to piss on my parade.

59:15.018 --> 59:18.920
Or are you still after
this General's head for your mantel?

59:19.022 --> 59:20.512
A little of both.

59:20.590 --> 59:22.080
Tell me where Medrano is

59:22.191 --> 59:25.251
and maybe you won't lose
any more investors.

59:28.865 --> 59:33.234
You are really breaking my heart,
choosing an insect like that over me.

59:34.771 --> 59:36.534
Are you going to throw me over?

59:36.606 --> 59:39.871
No. You've been drinking,
so maybe you slipped.

59:40.710 --> 59:43.201
Just think how much you'd miss me.

59:48.651 --> 59:50.141
Good evening.

59:50.253 --> 59:51.777
There you are.

59:53.656 --> 59:55.624
Would you excuse me?

59:55.725 --> 59:57.056
Mr. Bond.

59:58.061 --> 59:59.722
What a pleasure.

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:04.059
Well, careful with this one.
She won't go to bed with you

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:06.829
unless you give her something
she really wants.

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:09.063
It's a shame
because she's really quite stunning

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:11.971
once you get her on her back.

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:14.737
I wish I could say
the feeling was mutual.

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:16.108
I'm sorry, Mr. Greene, but we have to go.

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:18.477
Please. My friends call me Dominic.

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:20.242
I'm sure they do.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.741
How much do you know
about Bond, Camille?

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:26.084
Because he's rather a tragic case.

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:29.090
As Ml6 says, he's difficult to control.

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:33.822
Nice way of saying that everything
he touches seems to wither and die.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:35.124
Shall we?

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:37.758
Doesn't bode well for you, I'm afraid.

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.927
You two do make
a charming couple, though.

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:42.938
You're both... What's the expression?

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:44.598
Damaged goods.

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:49.511
Oh, my gosh!

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.004
I'm so sorry.

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:56.945
Come on, lighten up.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.011
You're cramping my style.

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:01.957
So it's British intelligence now.

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:03.617
What the hell do you want from me?

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:06.457
You're gonna show me
Dominic Greene's Tierra Project.

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:08.554
- Are you up to it?
- Do I have a choice?

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.462
Do you want one?

01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:13.400
There's something horribly
efficient about you.

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:15.300
Is that a compliment?

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:33.020
Well, what's the bet that Dominic Greene
has friends in the police force?

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:45.691
Stay here.

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:09.217
Now, why would you want me to do that?

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.054
Mathis?

01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:46.986
There's a hospital
on the other side of town.

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.427
Please.

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:51.228
Stay with me.

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:53.564
Stay here, please.

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:55.734
Please.

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:57.504
Come here.

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:02.309
It's okay.

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:05.771
That's better.

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:07.845
That doesn't hurt.

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:13.080
Is Mathis your cover name?

01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:15.317
Yes.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.587
Not a very good one, is it?

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:27.463
Do we forgive each other?

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.274
I shouldn't have left you alone.

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:35.174
Vesper.

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:38.606
She gave everything for you.

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.349
Forgive her.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.284
Forgive yourself.

01:04:07.643 --> 01:04:10.134
Is that how you treat your friends?

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.242
He wouldn't care.

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:20.853
Let's go.

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:38.073
<i>The Foreign Secretary's
asking to see you.</i>

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:40.039
What don't I know?

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:43.101
<i>René Mathis has been
shot dead in Bolivia.</i>

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:45.945
<i>The police claim it was Bond.</i>

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:21.511
<i>How much did you pay him?</i>

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:24.917
<i>Well, he wanted you,</i>
<i>but I left him the car as collateral.</i>

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:27.922
<i>He'll make much more</i>
<i>when he sells us out.</i>

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:31.854
<i>Right.</i>

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:34.719
<i>Let's see if this thing'll fly.</i>

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:50.939
<i>Here.</i>

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:54.539
<i>All the information I found said</i>
<i>there was nothing of value there,</i>

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:57.780
<i>but Greene's geologist</i>
<i>had proof that there was.</i>

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:04.593
<i>My sources tell me</i>
<i>you're Bolivian Secret Service,</i>

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:07.289
<i>or used to be,</i>

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:11.631
<i>and that you infiltrated Greene's</i>
<i>organization by having sex with him.</i>

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:15.560
<i>- That offends you?</i>
<i>- No, not in the slightest.</i>

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:18.236
<i>So what's your interest in Greene?</i>

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:21.333
<i>Amongst other things,</i>
<i>he tried to kill a friend of mine.</i>

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:22.911
<i>- A woman?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:24.904
<i>But it's not what you think.</i>

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:27.814
<i>- Your mother?</i>
<i>- She likes to think so.</i>

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.679
<i>What's that down there?</i>

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:37.921
<i>That's a sinkhole.</i>

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.189
<i>There are a few around here.</i>

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:44.528
<i>Just for the record,</i>
<i>I wasn't with Greene for my...</i>

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:20.999
Damn it!

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:52.230
I think we lost him!

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:03.339
He's coming fast!

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:52.317
He's right behind you!

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:36.161
Here. Put that on!

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:22.481
Come on!

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:44.903
Camille!

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:06.593
According to the Bolivians,
it was a routine stop,

01:11:06.695 --> 01:11:09.493
and when they discovered Mathis' body,
Bond disarmed and shot them.

01:11:09.732 --> 01:11:11.859
Of course, there are no witnesses
to prove otherwise.

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.732
I need something.
I can't go in there unarmed.

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:16.930
I'm sorry. There's nothing.

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:20.706
Come in.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:25.569
What's today's excuse?
That Bond is legally blind?

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:26.841
No, Minister.

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:29.713
I don't think I need to tell you
how upset the PM is.

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:32.680
With respect, the PM has my direct line.

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:36.282
And he'd have used it
if he'd wanted to speak to you.

01:11:36.392 --> 01:11:38.860
I'm sorry, M. Things have changed.

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:42.123
We've had long discussions
with our cousins.

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:44.426
Mr. Greene's interests
and ours now align.

01:11:44.533 --> 01:11:48.970
Minister, this man is a major player in one
of the most dangerous organizations...

01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:50.936
We've never even heard of.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.373
Foreign policy cannot be conducted on
the basis of hunches and innuendo.

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:56.638
Then give us time
to gather enough evidence

01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:58.713
so you can make informed decisions.

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:00.078
Fine.

01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:04.309
Say you're right.
Say Greene is a villain.

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:08.914
If we refused to do business with villains,
we'd have almost no one to trade with.

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:12.154
The world's running out of oil, M.
The Russians aren't playing ball.

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:14.559
The Americans and Chinese
are dividing up what's left.

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:17.098
Right or wrong doesn't come into it.

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:19.566
We're acting out of necessity.

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:24.803
Bond is running wild.

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:28.770
Who's to say he hasn't been turned?

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:32.746
Pull him in
or the Americans will put him down.

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:38.011
I think I found a way out.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.917
You're freezing.

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:42.985
I'm fine.

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:02.543
So what is it that Greene has
that you want?

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:11.176
It's not Greene.
It's Medrano, the man he met in Haiti.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:16.222
My father worked for the military junta.

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:18.816
He was a very cruel man,

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:22.529
but he was my father.

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:28.294
When I was a small child

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:31.533
the opposition sent <i>general</i>
Medrano to our house.

01:13:33.842 --> 01:13:35.707
He shot my father.

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:39.411
He did things to my mother and my sister

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:43.249
and then strangled them while I watched.

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:47.882
I was too young to be any trouble,

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:51.317
so he just smiled at me

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.923
and set the house on fire.

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:00.328
He left his mark.

01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:05.866
So when I pulled you off the boat...

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:08.341
I waited years for that chance.

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:11.170
I apologize.

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:17.015
It seems we're both using Greene
to get to somebody.

01:14:18.053 --> 01:14:19.850
You lost somebody?

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:21.754
I did, yes.

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:24.783
You catch whoever did it?

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.194
No. Not yet.

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:30.560
Tell me when you do.

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:33.799
I'd like to know how it feels.

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.566
We should go.

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:42.405
You ready?

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:18.504
They used dynamite.

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:23.748
This used to be a riverbed.

01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:43.867
Greene isn't after the oil.
He wants the water.

01:15:45.173 --> 01:15:46.765
We can't leave it like this.

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:50.869
It's one dam. He's creating a drought.
He'll have built others.

01:17:21.003 --> 01:17:23.267
Excuse me, sir. Your wife left a message.

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:26.398
The English woman,
she left it for you this morning.

01:17:26.508 --> 01:17:27.873
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:31.776
What is it?

01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:35.549
Would you mind waiting down here?

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:38.049
I'll be outside.

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:58.897
So that's what she meant.

01:17:59.307 --> 01:18:00.740
I hope you can trust these men.

01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:03.243
Just a moment. It's Tanner.

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:05.406
Yes?

01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:07.880
We've got the girl downstairs.

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:10.144
She says to tell you she's sorry
but this is not her fight.

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:11.879
It isn't. Let her go.

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:13.887
She isn't our concern.

01:18:14.489 --> 01:18:16.218
Well, I'm disappointed.

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:17.782
You are?

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:19.986
How much oil
did the Americans promise you?

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:21.153
This isn't about oil.

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:24.426
- Well, that's good, because there isn't any.
- It's about trust.

01:18:24.499 --> 01:18:26.330
You said you weren't motivated
by revenge.

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:28.926
- I'm motivated by my duty.
- No.

01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:32.930
I think you are so blinded
by inconsolable rage

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:35.408
that you don't care who you hurt.

01:18:35.477 --> 01:18:39.675
When you can't tell your friends
from your enemies, it's time to go.

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:49.988
You might like to tell her your theory
about there being no oil.

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:52.185
Her lungs are full of it.

01:18:53.595 --> 01:18:56.120
- It was Greene.
- No doubt. But why?

01:18:57.632 --> 01:19:00.795
- It's just misdirection.
- I mean, why her, Bond?

01:19:00.869 --> 01:19:05.932
She was just supposed to send you home.
She worked in an office, collecting reports.

01:19:06.441 --> 01:19:09.137
Look how well your charm works, James.

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:12.277
They'll do anything for you, won't they?

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:14.482
How many is that now?

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:18.952
You're removed from duty and suspended
pending further investigation.

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:23.650
You'll give whatever weapons you have
to these men and leave with them now.

01:20:08.603 --> 01:20:10.594
Miss Fields showed true bravery.

01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:12.605
I want that mentioned in your report.

01:20:12.707 --> 01:20:15.676
- Now you and I need to see this through.
- There's nowhere to go.

01:20:15.744 --> 01:20:18.713
There's a capture or
kill order out on you.

01:20:19.414 --> 01:20:21.507
Who would have done that?

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:32.258
- Ma'am?
- Find out where he's going.

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.351
- He's on to something.
- Ma'am, the CIA is insisting...

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:36.954
I could give a shit about the CIA
or their trumped-up evidence.

01:20:37.065 --> 01:20:40.057
He's my agent, and I trust him. Go on.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.210
- Get in.
- Are you gonna try and shoot me?

01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:56.875
I said, get in.

01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:14.059
You're gonna get botulism
if you keep drinking that.

01:21:14.135 --> 01:21:16.000
It's bottled water.

01:21:17.072 --> 01:21:19.802
It probably came from some stream
just around the corner from here.

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:22.433
Bunch of little kids peeing in it.

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:25.079
That's why I eat the peppers.

01:21:25.146 --> 01:21:30.243
Well, all I'm saying is
you can't trust a damn thing around here.

01:21:36.591 --> 01:21:38.991
You know,
you should just answer, "CIA," Felix.

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:41.392
A taxi driver told me
where the office was.

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:45.661
Well, if we're so easy to find, James,
you really should come visit.

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:50.397
Or maybe you should come out
and see some more of the city.

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:12.292
I heard a rumor you'd gone native.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.622
Felix.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.030
You know, I was just wondering
what South America would look like

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:23.297
if nobody gave a damn
about coke or communism.

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:25.965
It's always impressed me the way
you boys have carved this place up.

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:29.169
I'll take that as a compliment
coming from a Brit.

01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:33.806
Are you sure you're playing
with the right side?

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:35.816
Regimes change once a week down here.

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:37.784
Medrano'll be no dirtier
than the next guy.

01:22:37.852 --> 01:22:39.877
Oh, you see, that's what I
like about U.S. intelligence.

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:41.387
You'll lie down with anybody.

01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:43.889
Including you, brother. Including you.

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:46.392
Do you know you're being played?

01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:48.223
Dominic Greene's gonna
suck this place dry,

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:49.797
and then he's gonna move on,
and you're gonna be left

01:22:49.864 --> 01:22:51.126
picking up the broken crockery.

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:54.066
What can I tell you?
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:56.069
Well, you see, Felix,
I don't think you're half as cynical

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:57.297
as you make out to be.

01:22:57.372 --> 01:22:59.169
You don't know me.

01:23:01.676 --> 01:23:04.543
Why? Just because you didn't come alone?

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:07.648
- How long have I got?
- Thirty seconds.

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:12.816
Well, that doesn't give us
a lot of time, does it?

01:23:13.855 --> 01:23:17.382
Medrano can't move until he pays off
the army and the police chief.

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:19.084
<i>Greene's bringing
him his money now.</i>

01:23:19.194 --> 01:23:21.560
A hotel called La Perla de las Dunas

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:23.187
in the desert.

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:25.359
Thank you, Felix.

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:27.526
James, move your ass.

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:30.364
Get down! Get down, now!

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.187
Move it! Move it!

01:23:53.528 --> 01:23:56.224
What the hell happened?
What did you tell him?

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:58.265
Just what we agreed.

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:24.014
What are you doing?

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.685
The slide's caught.

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:30.954
Maybe you should check your own.

01:25:31.025 --> 01:25:32.617
I will.

01:25:37.398 --> 01:25:39.628
Have you ever killed someone?

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:45.202
Your training will tell you that
when the adrenaline kicks in

01:25:45.306 --> 01:25:47.137
you should compensate.

01:25:48.176 --> 01:25:52.806
But part of you is not gonna believe
the training because this kill is personal.

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:55.379
Take a deep breath.

01:25:55.717 --> 01:25:57.480
You only need one shot.

01:25:57.552 --> 01:25:59.349
Make it count.

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:07.417
In euros,

01:27:08.389 --> 01:27:09.788
as requested.

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:12.519
The dollar isn't what it once was.

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:15.290
The cost of war.

01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:19.625
I am afraid that the corruption
in this current government

01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:21.964
can no longer be tolerated.

01:27:24.772 --> 01:27:26.069
And mine?

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:29.436
Right after you sign over my land.

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:47.084
My first official act.

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.764
And this, if you would.

01:27:54.836 --> 01:27:56.167
What is this?

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:57.431
As of this moment,

01:27:57.505 --> 01:28:02.499
my organization owns
more than 60% of Bolivia's water supply.

01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:06.273
So this contract states
that your new government

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:09.282
will use us as utilities provider.

01:28:10.084 --> 01:28:13.019
This is double what we are paying now.

01:28:16.591 --> 01:28:18.786
Well, then don't sign it.

01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:24.123
But you should know something
about me and the people I work with.

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:27.291
<i>We deal with the
left or the right,</i>

01:28:27.368 --> 01:28:30.997
with dictators or liberators.

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:34.267
If the current president
had been more agreeable,

01:28:34.342 --> 01:28:36.537
I wouldn't be talking to you.

01:28:36.644 --> 01:28:38.874
So, if you decide not to sign,

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.141
you will wake up
with your balls in your mouth

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:44.548
and your willing replacement
standing over you.

01:28:46.387 --> 01:28:48.685
If you doubt that, then shoot me,

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:52.021
<i>take that money</i>
<i>and have a good night's sleep.</i>

01:29:52.387 --> 01:29:54.855
You and I had a mutual friend.

01:32:44.892 --> 01:32:47.827
Sounds like you just lost another one.

01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:59.493
Not this way. Not this way.

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:02.125
I can't. I can't.

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:14.645
Come here.

01:34:19.754 --> 01:34:21.517
Like you said,

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:23.487
"Take a deep breath.

01:34:24.759 --> 01:34:26.351
"Make it count."

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.263
Close your eyes.

01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:44.108
Come on!

01:34:58.626 --> 01:35:00.150
Wait here.

01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:34.857
- You promised that you'd...
- Let you go?

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:37.728
I answered your questions.

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:40.562
I told you what you wanted
to know about Quantum.

01:35:40.668 --> 01:35:42.192
Yes, you did,

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:45.539
and your friends'd know that
so they're probably looking for you.

01:35:45.706 --> 01:35:49.335
But the good news is,
you're in the middle of a desert.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.377
Here.

01:35:56.250 --> 01:35:59.947
I bet you make it 20 miles before you
consider drinking that.

01:36:00.054 --> 01:36:01.954
Goodbye, Mr. Greene.

01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:43.096
Thank you.

01:36:43.831 --> 01:36:45.799
It's my pleasure.

01:36:46.934 --> 01:36:48.561
Are you all right?

01:36:48.969 --> 01:36:50.163
Fine.

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:52.970
But I keep thinking, "He's dead.

01:36:53.407 --> 01:36:54.772
"Now what?"

01:36:55.242 --> 01:36:57.676
Well, the dam we saw
will have to come down,

01:36:57.778 --> 01:36:58.802
and there'll be others, too.

01:36:58.913 --> 01:37:01.780
Someone who worked for Greene
might be of help.

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:04.481
Not a bad idea.

01:37:09.089 --> 01:37:11.990
Do you think they'll
be able to sleep now?

01:37:14.361 --> 01:37:17.353
I don't think the dead
care about vengeance.

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.995
I wish I could set you free.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.601
But your prison is in there.

01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:22.328
Fine. Anything for an easy life.

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:27.232
Sit down.

01:38:27.968 --> 01:38:29.333
Sit down!

01:38:30.671 --> 01:38:32.229
It's okay, baby.

01:38:49.089 --> 01:38:50.716
You're Canadian?

01:38:51.258 --> 01:38:53.658
You work in Canadian intelligence?

01:38:53.727 --> 01:38:55.922
It's all right. I know you do.

01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:58.330
And knowing this man,

01:38:58.399 --> 01:39:00.924
I'd guess you have access
to some very sensitive material

01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:03.094
which you're gonna be forced to give up.

01:39:03.203 --> 01:39:04.363
His life will be threatened,

01:39:04.438 --> 01:39:07.407
and because you love him,
you won't hesitate.

01:39:08.375 --> 01:39:10.366
It's a beautiful necklace.

01:39:11.078 --> 01:39:13.012
Did he give it to you?

01:39:14.915 --> 01:39:17.110
I have one just like it.

01:39:19.954 --> 01:39:22.422
He gave it to a friend of mine,

01:39:22.523 --> 01:39:24.457
someone very close to me.

01:39:28.228 --> 01:39:29.559
Your name is?

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:31.359
- Corrine.
- Corrine.

01:39:31.966 --> 01:39:33.456
Corrine, I suggest you leave now.

01:39:33.567 --> 01:39:36.035
You contact your people,
and you tell them to check their seals.

01:39:36.103 --> 01:39:37.934
They have a leak.

01:39:38.038 --> 01:39:39.801
Do it now, please.

01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:43.767
This man and I have
some unfinished business.

01:39:54.421 --> 01:39:55.786
Thank you.

01:40:00.461 --> 01:40:01.723
Please.

01:40:02.429 --> 01:40:03.987
Make it quick.

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:14.807
Is he still alive?

01:40:14.908 --> 01:40:16.102
He is.

01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:18.168
I'm surprised.

01:40:19.346 --> 01:40:21.177
Did you find what you were looking for?

01:40:21.281 --> 01:40:22.680
- Yes.
- Good.

01:40:24.118 --> 01:40:27.087
- I assume you have no regrets.
- I don't.

01:40:27.154 --> 01:40:28.849
What about you?

01:40:29.256 --> 01:40:32.157
Of course not.
That would be unprofessional.

01:40:33.127 --> 01:40:34.185
They found Greene dead

01:40:34.294 --> 01:40:37.024
in the middle of the Bolivian desert,
of all places.

01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:39.531
Two bullets in the back of his skull.

01:40:39.633 --> 01:40:42.329
They found motor oil in his stomach.

01:40:42.436 --> 01:40:44.370
Does that mean anything to you?

01:40:44.471 --> 01:40:46.098
Wish I could help.

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:49.199
You'll be glad to know, I straightened
things out with the Americans.

01:40:49.309 --> 01:40:51.174
Your friend Leiter's been promoted.

01:40:51.278 --> 01:40:52.643
He replaced Beam.

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:55.181
Well, then the right
people kept their jobs.

01:40:55.282 --> 01:40:57.011
Something like that.

01:40:58.552 --> 01:41:01.112
Congratulations. You were right.

01:41:01.188 --> 01:41:02.621
About what?

01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:04.782
About Vesper.

01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:08.492
Ma'am.

01:41:10.798 --> 01:41:12.060
Bond,

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.129
I need you back.

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:17.026
I never left.

01:43:17.027 --> 01:43:18.027
