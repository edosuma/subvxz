Let's go, let's go!

00:15.934 --> 00:17.882
MAN: Redcoats!
Redcoats are coming!

00:18.090 --> 00:20.173
REDCOAT:
Stop in the name of the throne!

00:26.818 --> 00:28.586
You're certain
this is the right place?

00:28.620 --> 00:31.222
Quite certain, Captain.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.740
Secure that door.

00:35.860 --> 00:37.508
What door?

00:40.365 --> 00:42.333
Man the door.

00:42.367 --> 00:44.635
Sir... with all due respect...

00:44.670 --> 00:46.170
General Washington's orders
were firm.

00:46.204 --> 00:49.307
Bring back the crate and you.
Alive.

00:49.341 --> 00:51.633
- Man the door.
- Captain, this way.

00:55.514 --> 00:58.649
In the name of the Virginia militia,
we claim this cargo.

00:58.684 --> 00:59.812
Step aside.

01:17.803 --> 01:20.471
CRANE: Surviving death,
separated by time,

01:20.505 --> 01:23.040
tests the bonds of love.

01:23.075 --> 01:24.709
The moment I saw her,

01:24.743 --> 01:29.680
I knew the bravest love
is born again with each new day.

01:29.715 --> 01:33.217
The kind of love that
makes the mundane a marvel,

01:33.251 --> 01:37.054
that bewilders with its magnificence.

01:39.057 --> 01:43.127
Until fate's cruel hand intervened.

01:43.161 --> 01:47.898
And in the blink of an eye,
Katrina was lost to me.

01:47.933 --> 01:52.056
WOMAN:
I am so, so sorry.

01:52.091 --> 01:56.140
I offer this tale, no matter how cruelly
he may have treated you,

01:56.174 --> 01:58.342
to suggest
that you do not give up.

01:58.377 --> 02:00.511
Nor give into anything
less than certainty

02:00.545 --> 02:01.979
in matters of the heart.

02:02.014 --> 02:04.982
No one's ever s-said it like that.

02:05.017 --> 02:06.384
Thank you.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.352
It is I who should thank you,
kind woman,

02:08.387 --> 02:11.021
for unlocking this vehicle from afar.

02:11.056 --> 02:12.490
And...

02:12.524 --> 02:16.093
showing me how the
entertainment system operates.

02:17.696 --> 02:21.332
Farewell, Yolanda.

02:21.366 --> 02:24.368
Thank you for calling
NorthStar Assistance.

02:46.458 --> 02:47.591
ABBIE:
Crane.

02:47.626 --> 02:49.560
Jenny escaped.

02:52.397 --> 02:54.932
IRVING:
You want me to call off the search

02:54.966 --> 02:56.367
and give your sister a head start?

02:56.401 --> 02:59.270
I'm asking you to give me a head start
so this doesn't escalate.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.373
She's been here a year and a half
with a release in six months.

03:02.407 --> 03:04.809
Why risk everything now
without a good reason?

03:05.911 --> 03:08.412
You're attributing reason?

03:08.447 --> 03:11.715
Jenny's psych reports characterize her
as disciplined and methodical.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.951
Jenny does not do random.

03:13.985 --> 03:16.720
Then for my money,
that makes her even scarier.

03:16.755 --> 03:19.723
You come visit your sister yesterday,

03:19.758 --> 03:21.492
Crane talks to her
for all of five minutes,

03:21.526 --> 03:24.295
and tonight she escapes.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.430
What the hell did you say to her?

03:26.465 --> 03:30.101
I merely informed the lady there'd been
a series of murders in Sleepy Hollow,

03:30.135 --> 03:33.571
and she might be helpful
to our investigation.

03:33.605 --> 03:34.805
Well, that is just great.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.407
My opinion, though admittedly

03:36.441 --> 03:38.909
not a professional one,
is that Miss Jennifer Mills

03:38.944 --> 03:40.511
is a brilliant misunderstood woman,

03:40.545 --> 03:43.781
haunted by a past
she's struggling to understand.

03:43.815 --> 03:47.251
Yet her past is precisely
what makes her valuable to us.

03:47.285 --> 03:49.253
Due respect, Crane,

03:49.287 --> 03:52.957
if I were her, you're the last guy
I'd want vouching for my sanity.

03:52.991 --> 03:55.292
ABBIE:
Sir, you want facts.

03:55.327 --> 03:56.861
We've had four dead bodies
in two weeks.

03:56.895 --> 03:59.296
That is a disturbing average
by anyone's count.

03:59.331 --> 04:02.333
And all of them barely explainable.

04:02.367 --> 04:05.369
And how does this relate
to your sister's escape?

04:05.403 --> 04:07.538
I don't know.

04:07.572 --> 04:08.939
But it does.

04:08.974 --> 04:10.674
And enough to make her run.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.476
That is why you need me.

04:12.511 --> 04:15.446
If I can get her to tell us
what she thinks is happening here,

04:15.480 --> 04:18.048
maybe we can get ahead of this.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.851
I just need you to buy me
a little bit of time.

04:20.886 --> 04:23.187
You got 12 hours.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.298
Then she's on a nationwide warrant.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.181
I think you earned this.

04:50.215 --> 04:51.515
I need my things, Wendel.

04:51.550 --> 04:52.983
Sure.

04:53.018 --> 04:55.418
Been burning a hole in my safe
since you left it.

05:01.560 --> 05:04.495
Thanks, I owe you one.

05:04.529 --> 05:05.930
You owe me nothing.

05:05.964 --> 05:08.766
Except an explanation would be nice.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.569
Remember when I told you one day
this town was gonna go straight to hell?

05:13.538 --> 05:15.539
I hate being right.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.713
Left hand down.

05:22.747 --> 05:24.715
Always the left hand will save you.

05:34.226 --> 05:37.394
Please continue from here...
The ninth measure.

05:37.429 --> 05:40.044
MALE VOICE:
Jennifer Mills has escaped.

05:40.106 --> 05:44.069
We have reason to believe she
knows where item 37 is located.

05:44.103 --> 05:47.205
You will find her
and then retrieve item 37.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.474
A cleanup crew will arrive
to assist your search.

05:50.508 --> 05:52.443
They have a list of
her known associates.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.079
Hang up if you understand.

06:05.475 --> 06:07.243
Can I help you?

06:09.191 --> 06:11.201
My associates and I seek a woman

06:11.236 --> 06:13.697
who may have entered
your establishment, yes?

06:15.867 --> 06:17.268
Jennifer Mills?

06:21.940 --> 06:24.241
Never heard of her, fella.

06:24.276 --> 06:26.243
A lot of women come in here.

06:26.278 --> 06:29.213
You guys got to go.

06:32.617 --> 06:36.020
Lies require commitment, Mr. Clark.

06:37.923 --> 06:40.624
Are you quite certain
you're committed to your course?

06:41.740 --> 06:44.187
I assure you I am.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.832
Well, I'll tell you what.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.004
You all walk out of here,

06:54.039 --> 06:57.574
and I won't redecorate
this place with your face.

07:09.921 --> 07:11.055
Son of a bitch.

07:11.089 --> 07:13.290
Jennifer Mills.

07:13.325 --> 07:15.159
She was here, yes?

07:16.661 --> 07:18.862
Yes, yes, she was here.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.732
Excellent start.

07:21.766 --> 07:24.535
However...

07:24.569 --> 07:28.505
progress requires suffering
to evolve.

07:28.540 --> 07:29.973
Go to hell.

07:31.009 --> 07:32.910
No need for that, Mr. Clark.

07:32.944 --> 07:36.747
In due time, hell will come to us.

07:39.751 --> 07:43.451
1.04 - The Lesser Key of Solomon
Sync and corrected by <font color="#FF0000">Elderfel</font>
www.addic7ed.com

08:13.164 --> 08:14.365
ABBIE:
No. Listen to me.

08:14.399 --> 08:16.800
I already have a copy
of the impound report.

08:16.835 --> 08:18.302
I haven't spoken
with the other officer,

08:18.336 --> 08:21.238
or I would've directed my questions
to them instead of you.

08:21.272 --> 08:24.041
Your sister bears an inglorious list
of prior convictions.

08:24.075 --> 08:25.642
Weapons charges.

08:25.677 --> 08:29.690
- Breaking and entering.
- She never did do anything halfway.

08:29.725 --> 08:31.509
I want to know
where she dumped the car,

08:31.550 --> 08:34.551
were there any recent GTAs in the area,
carjack reports,

08:34.586 --> 08:36.520
and what direction she was going.

08:36.554 --> 08:38.155
I'll hold.

08:38.188 --> 08:40.657
It seems
when she wasn't incarcerated,

08:40.692 --> 08:42.393
she was traveling the world.

08:42.427 --> 08:47.564
There are records of journeys
to Mexico, Guatemala, Nepal...

08:47.599 --> 08:50.033
someplace called Somalia.

08:50.068 --> 08:52.069
It's a country in Africa.

08:52.103 --> 08:55.205
Not exactly known
for its law and order.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.540
She would've fit right in.

08:56.574 --> 08:57.841
Why would someone travel

08:57.876 --> 09:00.043
to such exotic locales
and then return

09:00.078 --> 09:03.347
to Sleepy Hollow
if all that awaited her here

09:03.381 --> 09:04.715
- was potential incarceration?
- I don't know.

09:04.749 --> 09:07.717
It's not like she had to come back
for family reunions.

09:08.920 --> 09:12.289
A personal query, if I may.

09:12.323 --> 09:14.725
Where was your family
during all this?

09:14.759 --> 09:16.860
This is the perfect time
to ask me about my childhood.

09:16.895 --> 09:20.864
No, those dates were two weeks ago,
I need today.

09:20.899 --> 09:23.500
That is what I meant by "recently."
Call me back.

09:30.608 --> 09:32.943
Dad bailed when we were kids.

09:32.977 --> 09:35.646
Mom had a nervous breakdown
a few years later.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.981
Hospitalized.

09:38.016 --> 09:40.451
The state dumped us in foster care.

09:44.289 --> 09:46.423
So, question answered.

09:50.929 --> 09:54.398
After the age of 12,
you had one foster home

09:54.432 --> 09:56.900
and Miss Jenny had seven.

09:56.935 --> 09:59.903
I raise it merely to note
she resided in her last home

09:59.938 --> 10:01.271
for nearly a full year.

10:01.306 --> 10:04.007
Perhaps these charitable souls
possess...

10:04.042 --> 10:06.810
some information
that might help us locate her.

10:53.358 --> 10:54.391
Definitely not a robbery.

10:54.425 --> 10:55.492
Till's still loaded.

10:55.527 --> 10:58.462
There's a bank deposit bag
full of cash and last night's receipts.

10:58.496 --> 11:00.864
Whatever it was, it was personal.

11:00.899 --> 11:03.500
You might want to check
your breakfast, boss.

11:11.075 --> 11:12.876
What do you got up there?

11:12.911 --> 11:15.145
My guess is somebody
played a little hardball

11:15.179 --> 11:17.514
and then made a piñata
out of him.

11:17.549 --> 11:19.049
And a paperweight.

11:21.953 --> 11:24.054
Just like Corbin and the Reverend.

11:24.088 --> 11:26.590
No. The wounds aren't cauterized.

11:26.624 --> 11:28.958
Corbin's and the Reverend's were.

11:29.928 --> 11:33.485
Markings on the torso, face...

11:33.520 --> 11:35.392
This man was tortured first.

11:35.427 --> 11:38.099
Based on the blood pattern,
head was taken after the fact,

11:38.134 --> 11:39.619
not as the killing blow.

11:39.654 --> 11:42.839
Aside from the beheading,
the M.O. is completely different.

11:42.874 --> 11:44.608
I want to know the second
Forensics has anything,

11:44.642 --> 11:45.943
on my cell phone only.

11:45.977 --> 11:47.678
Let's stay off the radio on this one.

11:47.712 --> 11:49.012
You expecting more of this?

11:49.047 --> 11:50.347
In this town?

11:50.381 --> 11:51.848
What do you think?

11:54.119 --> 11:56.053
LUANNE: Jenny was trouble.
I remember that much.

11:56.087 --> 11:59.923
Someone push her buttons,
whoo-ee, she went off.

11:59.958 --> 12:02.059
And I had to plead her case

12:02.093 --> 12:04.361
to the school superintendent
or the sheriff.

12:04.395 --> 12:05.596
You spoke to Sheriff Corbin
about her?

12:05.630 --> 12:07.097
Ralphie, shut up!

12:08.766 --> 12:10.968
Corbin's the one
that caught her shoplifting.

12:11.002 --> 12:13.403
He let her off, though.

12:13.438 --> 12:15.038
She claimed they'd never met.

12:15.073 --> 12:17.374
To be honest,
maybe a little hard jail time

12:17.408 --> 12:18.809
would've straightened her out.

12:18.843 --> 12:23.413
Troubled kids,
they need discipline and order.

12:23.448 --> 12:24.915
That's what I give 'em.

12:24.949 --> 12:28.118
ABBIE: The government pays you
a monthly stipend for every child

12:28.152 --> 12:29.386
you take in, does it not?

12:29.420 --> 12:31.822
Trust me, it ain't enough.

12:31.856 --> 12:33.924
- Must be a hardship.
- If you're implying

12:33.958 --> 12:35.592
that I'm taking advantage
of the situation...

12:35.627 --> 12:37.661
I'm not implying, I'm declaring.

12:37.695 --> 12:39.056
That girl is sleeping on the floor

12:39.130 --> 12:41.451
in violation of your
conservatorship contract

12:41.489 --> 12:43.254
and about ten state laws.

12:43.301 --> 12:45.736
Bags under her eyes, dry skin,

12:45.770 --> 12:48.005
all symptoms of malnutrition,
and yet somehow you have

12:48.039 --> 12:51.518
enough money to put
a brand-new car in the driveway.

12:51.553 --> 12:52.809
How is that?

12:52.844 --> 12:56.780
I put a roof over your sister's head
when no one else would.

12:56.814 --> 12:58.715
Nobody wanted her.

13:01.352 --> 13:03.520
Lieutenant.

13:07.825 --> 13:10.293
You have one choice right now.

13:10.328 --> 13:12.863
That is to tell me something,
anything...

13:12.897 --> 13:15.032
that will help me find her,

13:15.066 --> 13:18.535
or so help me, I will rain
legal brimstone down on you

13:18.569 --> 13:21.004
so hard it will make God jealous.

13:23.741 --> 13:26.810
She used to take off
and go up to Trout Lake,

13:26.844 --> 13:29.895
about four miles north of here.
Said there was a cabin up there,

13:29.948 --> 13:32.149
- belonged to a friend.
- What friend?

13:32.183 --> 13:35.085
I got no idea.

13:36.754 --> 13:39.456
Expect a call from Family Services.

13:39.490 --> 13:40.957
Shutting you down.

13:40.992 --> 13:42.893
And get that girl some food.

13:42.927 --> 13:44.528
She told me about you.

13:44.562 --> 13:48.065
The "good" sister
that just walked away.

13:48.099 --> 13:51.401
Who you really mad at here, girly?

13:51.436 --> 13:53.770
Me or you?

14:40.226 --> 14:41.390
What are you doing?

14:41.425 --> 14:44.097
Old habits die hard.

14:44.898 --> 14:46.992
How fortuitous.

14:47.325 --> 14:49.426
An officer of the law
with a criminal past.

14:49.460 --> 14:50.861
Mm.

14:50.895 --> 14:52.896
Imagine the delinquency
we could perpetrate

14:52.930 --> 14:55.398
if we really put our minds to it.

15:31.669 --> 15:33.603
Lieutenant...

15:33.638 --> 15:36.873
This home belonged to Sheriff Corbin.

15:38.943 --> 15:40.477
Your sister?

15:42.647 --> 15:44.314
My God.

15:44.348 --> 15:46.467
I know. She lied to me.

15:46.502 --> 15:48.829
It appears they were quite close.

15:48.886 --> 15:51.048
You have no idea.

15:53.931 --> 15:55.238
- Put it down.
- You put it down.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.881
- I'm not gonna ask you twice.
- Neither am I.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.963
Well... this is awkward.

16:07.695 --> 16:09.996
- You gonna shoot me?
- Why do you think

16:10.030 --> 16:12.531
that we walk through the door
instead of the SWAT team?

16:12.566 --> 16:14.867
I bought you time.
You need to trust me.

16:14.902 --> 16:16.702
Trust is the last thing
you're getting from me.

16:16.737 --> 16:19.240
You have no idea
what we're dealing with here.

16:19.275 --> 16:21.799
- Jenny, I'm trying to make things right.
- Give me a break!

16:21.834 --> 16:24.669
It's so much easier for you
to stick your head in the sand,

16:24.711 --> 16:26.412
pretend what's right in front of you
isn't really happening.

16:26.447 --> 16:29.015
Maybe I ought to leave you here
so you can bury your damn self!

16:29.049 --> 16:30.383
JENNY:
Yeah, 'cause you're good at...

16:30.417 --> 16:31.717
Enough!

16:32.578 --> 16:35.413
If your familial ties
meant so little to you,

16:35.447 --> 16:38.015
you'd spend far less effort
baiting her into a fight

16:38.050 --> 16:40.684
just to stoke your misguided pride.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.221
And you...

16:43.255 --> 16:47.892
Do make some effort not
to be such an easy target.

16:47.926 --> 16:52.696
Now drop your weapons,
both of you.

16:59.805 --> 17:02.206
Nice to see you again, British Guy.

17:02.241 --> 17:04.608
My name is Ichabod Crane.

17:04.643 --> 17:07.779
How long was Sheriff Corbin
in your life?

17:07.813 --> 17:09.614
What, he didn't tell you?

17:09.647 --> 17:11.249
No, he did not.

17:11.282 --> 17:13.885
The man had secrets.

17:13.919 --> 17:16.454
I just never knew
you were one of them.

17:16.488 --> 17:19.656
Well, unlike certain people,
he believed me.

17:20.659 --> 17:23.391
I helped him obtain rare objects,

17:23.425 --> 17:27.080
dig for information and find answers.

17:27.116 --> 17:29.692
He sent you traveling? Why?

17:29.727 --> 17:32.256
I knew you especially wouldn't understand.

17:34.239 --> 17:36.107
Corbin sent me here.

17:36.141 --> 17:37.642
When?

17:37.676 --> 17:41.278
He came to visit me
the night before he died.

17:44.950 --> 17:47.652
Never saw him in such a state.

17:47.686 --> 17:51.189
He felt something
was coming for him.

17:53.192 --> 17:57.628
And when I asked him what,
all he said was "Death."

17:57.663 --> 17:59.797
My God.

18:03.969 --> 18:06.404
He told me that if it
turned out to be true,

18:06.438 --> 18:08.339
I had to come here
and get something,

18:08.373 --> 18:10.908
something that he needed me
to keep safe.

18:26.294 --> 18:29.647
A sextant.
For mapping sea travel.

18:29.762 --> 18:31.796
I never heard Corbin
talk about it before.

18:32.830 --> 18:36.099
Until the night before he died, right?

18:36.133 --> 18:38.969
JENNY: The man was scared.
That's all I know.

18:40.638 --> 18:42.472
Quite.

18:45.009 --> 18:47.310
May I?

18:47.345 --> 18:49.446
These markings, I've seen them.

18:49.480 --> 18:52.044
Before the war in Boston.

18:52.181 --> 18:54.995
We received word the Redcoats
had acquired a device...

18:55.086 --> 18:58.889
a weapon whose power could
turn the tide of the war

18:58.923 --> 19:01.359
- in favor of the British.
- Wait. Wait a minute.

19:01.393 --> 19:02.793
Is he kidding?

19:02.828 --> 19:05.372
Five-second recap.
Revolutionary soldier.

19:05.407 --> 19:06.831
His wife put a spell
on him and he wakes up

19:06.865 --> 19:08.900
two centuries later,
now he's here.

19:08.934 --> 19:11.669
How's that for believing?

19:12.938 --> 19:14.972
Which regiment?

19:15.007 --> 19:16.007
The 37th.

19:16.041 --> 19:17.008
Commanding officer?

19:17.042 --> 19:18.876
Colonel Jonathan Brewer,

19:18.911 --> 19:20.912
under the command of
General George Washington.

19:20.946 --> 19:24.882
If Washington knew the precise nature
of the weapon we were sent to steal,

19:24.917 --> 19:28.052
he certainly didn't tell us.

19:28.086 --> 19:30.821
We tracked the secret weapon
to a shipping warehouse

19:30.856 --> 19:33.224
at Boston Harbor.

19:33.258 --> 19:36.394
As the British import tax on tea
was at an all-time high,

19:36.428 --> 19:39.196
I devised a diversion to gain entry.

19:41.128 --> 19:42.853
The Boston Tea Party?

19:42.868 --> 19:45.002
You're not telling me this.

19:45.037 --> 19:50.585
With the help of a local politician
and ally in Boston, Mr. Samuel Adams.

19:50.776 --> 19:53.678
ABBIE: You invented
the Boston Tea Party

19:53.712 --> 19:56.080
so that you could steal something
from the British?

19:56.114 --> 19:58.883
At the time, it was referred
to as "The destruction of the tea."

19:58.917 --> 20:02.853
You've coined
a far more festive name.

20:02.888 --> 20:08.192
Unfortunately, my plans to acquire
the weapon did not proceed smoothly.

20:08.226 --> 20:09.994
Let's get what we came for.

20:13.866 --> 20:16.728
The soldier guarding it
was a Hessian.

20:16.763 --> 20:19.570
- ABBIE: Like the Horseman.
- JENNY: As in "the" Horseman?

20:19.604 --> 20:20.972
One story at a time.

20:21.006 --> 20:24.408
The Hessian took his own life
to protect the weapon.

20:24.943 --> 20:26.310
No!

20:28.947 --> 20:31.415
I alone was spared.

20:34.953 --> 20:37.822
I saw what it was
they sent us to claim.

20:37.856 --> 20:40.591
A chest made of stone,

20:40.625 --> 20:42.226
therefore protected from the blast,

20:42.260 --> 20:45.429
covered in markings identical to this.

20:45.464 --> 20:47.298
I summoned a detachment

20:47.332 --> 20:49.834
to ferry the chest back to Washington
in secret.

20:49.868 --> 20:52.670
That was the last I ever saw of it.

20:52.704 --> 20:56.073
- You never saw what was inside?
- Whatever it was,

20:56.108 --> 20:59.310
it warranted the deploying
of Hessians to guard it.

20:59.344 --> 21:02.179
German soldiers
loyal to the British crown,

21:02.214 --> 21:04.615
known for their ruthlessness
in combat.

21:04.649 --> 21:06.450
They sound fun.

21:06.485 --> 21:07.985
Why is the sextant
connected to that chest?

21:08.020 --> 21:10.621
Like many artifacts from my era,

21:10.655 --> 21:12.957
this sextant is much more
than it appears.

21:12.991 --> 21:15.993
A torch, a torch.

21:22.134 --> 21:23.968
Whoa.

21:24.002 --> 21:26.137
It's a projector...

21:26.171 --> 21:30.107
hidden within
the design of a sextant.

21:30.142 --> 21:34.452
Washington,
an avid cartographer himself,

21:34.487 --> 21:37.715
had them crafted to hide
weapons on the battlefield.

21:37.749 --> 21:39.784
Looks like an old survey map.

21:39.818 --> 21:41.352
Of Sleepy Hollow.

21:41.386 --> 21:42.987
But from my era.

21:44.523 --> 21:49.493
I believe it pinpoints the whereabouts
of our mystery chest.

21:51.663 --> 21:52.863
Get down!

22:34.940 --> 22:37.641
Don't move!

22:48.420 --> 22:50.653
The sextant.

22:50.989 --> 22:53.390
They've taken it.

22:59.531 --> 23:01.098
Uzi pistol...

23:01.132 --> 23:03.934
military specs.

23:03.968 --> 23:06.136
That's a lot of gun for Sleepy Hollow.

23:08.206 --> 23:09.773
What's in the chest?

23:12.143 --> 23:13.644
Answer me.

23:15.013 --> 23:17.981
Okay. Enough. My turn.

23:18.016 --> 23:20.299
- What the hell are you doing?
- This man tried to kill us.

23:20.334 --> 23:22.953
- I am telling you to back down!
- You want a feather?

23:22.987 --> 23:24.688
- We can tickle it out of him?
- Ladies.

23:42.975 --> 23:45.809
Like the Horseman before him,

23:45.844 --> 23:47.845
he's a Hessian.

23:49.748 --> 23:52.182
Still at it after two centuries.

23:52.217 --> 23:54.051
It appears time hasn't diminished

23:54.085 --> 23:56.887
the Hessian's fascination
with ancient artifacts.

24:02.060 --> 24:04.528
Your German is exceptional.

24:04.562 --> 24:07.231
As is your tenacity.

24:07.265 --> 24:08.866
What's in the box?

24:08.900 --> 24:11.135
A doorway...

24:11.169 --> 24:13.971
to the seventh circle of Hell,

24:14.005 --> 24:17.741
where 72 condemned souls
wait upon a shore

24:17.776 --> 24:19.543
of flaming sand.

24:19.577 --> 24:21.645
A flair for the dramatic, I see.

24:21.679 --> 24:24.348
The Book of Revelation is dramatic.

24:24.382 --> 24:26.049
For the two witnesses

24:26.084 --> 24:27.885
of what has to come.

24:27.919 --> 24:28.919
JENNY:
72 demons.

24:28.953 --> 24:33.223
The Lesser Key of Solomon.
That's what you're talking about, right?

24:33.258 --> 24:35.859
Are we all having the
same conversation here?

24:35.894 --> 24:37.594
It's a legend.

24:37.629 --> 24:40.831
About a book of black magic
written by King Solomon,

24:40.865 --> 24:42.599
filled with rituals

24:42.634 --> 24:45.335
that can conjure 72 demons
he trapped in Hell.

24:45.370 --> 24:49.573
Are we to understand
this book itself is a key?

24:49.607 --> 24:52.743
Capable of unleashing
these demons into our world?

24:52.777 --> 24:54.511
JENNY:
It was found 12 centuries later

24:54.546 --> 24:57.548
by the Knights Templar
during the Crusades.

24:57.582 --> 24:59.249
Hidden away somewhere.

24:59.284 --> 25:03.754
And thanks to your efforts,
within our grasp at last.

25:03.788 --> 25:05.189
That is never gonna happen.

25:05.223 --> 25:07.124
You continue to misunderstand.

25:07.158 --> 25:10.294
These hours are the final movements

25:10.328 --> 25:13.864
of a symphony written centuries ago.

25:13.898 --> 25:17.712
And all the while,
we've been hiding here in Sleepy Hollow.

25:17.747 --> 25:19.570
Living ordinary, quiet lives

25:19.604 --> 25:22.767
as we pass your manicured lawns

25:22.941 --> 25:24.107
smiling amicable smiles.

25:24.142 --> 25:26.810
One, two, three.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.713
We're your neighbors.

25:29.747 --> 25:32.816
Perhaps even your friends.

25:32.851 --> 25:35.719
Yet underneath the skin,

25:35.753 --> 25:39.056
unhindered by conscience,
compassion,

25:39.090 --> 25:40.491
remorse...

25:40.525 --> 25:42.682
Security video placed
the murder scene car at this address.

25:42.717 --> 25:45.629
Prints at the scene are a match
for the car and the premises.

25:45.663 --> 25:48.398
The man's a music teacher.

25:48.433 --> 25:50.734
What the hell is happening here?

25:50.768 --> 25:52.836
Detectives.

25:52.871 --> 25:54.671
How many of you are there?

25:56.674 --> 25:58.876
GUNTHER:
Even I don't know.

26:00.278 --> 26:02.516
And that's the whole point.

26:03.317 --> 26:07.578
But I assure you,
we are everywhere.

26:07.579 --> 26:09.443
Growing stronger...

26:09.692 --> 26:12.480
preparing for the inevitable...

26:12.581 --> 26:16.701
knowing our cause is just.

26:17.296 --> 26:19.796
Sleeper cells always
have someone at the top.

26:19.831 --> 26:21.598
One person who controls the board,

26:21.633 --> 26:24.268
who knows the endgame,

26:24.302 --> 26:26.270
who moves
all the chess pieces around.

26:26.304 --> 26:29.039
You have already met him...

26:29.073 --> 26:32.814
Miss Grace Abigail Mills.

26:34.812 --> 26:36.680
You all have.

26:36.681 --> 26:40.952
You, Miss Jennifer Mills...
and Mr. Ichabod Crane.

26:40.987 --> 26:42.619
How do you know my name?

26:42.654 --> 26:44.688
- He told me.
- Who?

26:44.722 --> 26:46.390
He's inside of you.

26:46.424 --> 26:49.660
In your hearts, in your minds.

26:49.694 --> 26:52.996
He's been there
since he appeared to you

26:53.031 --> 26:54.665
that day in the forest.

27:04.943 --> 27:07.678
He summoned the Horseman.

27:07.712 --> 27:11.648
And with each dark spirit
he brings into our world,

27:11.683 --> 27:15.519
his grand design gets stronger.

27:15.553 --> 27:17.688
He wants you to understand.

27:17.722 --> 27:19.022
Tell me his name!

27:19.057 --> 27:20.591
My brothers have the map,

27:20.625 --> 27:24.094
and soon the doorway will open,

27:24.128 --> 27:27.364
and my task will be completed.

27:37.108 --> 27:38.976
There's something in his mouth.

27:40.778 --> 27:41.878
There's something in his mouth!

27:41.913 --> 27:43.246
CRANE:
Hold him, hold him!

27:46.618 --> 27:48.151
CRANE:
No, no!

27:51.589 --> 27:52.723
ABBIE:
A cyanide pill.

27:56.094 --> 27:58.362
What did he say?

28:05.303 --> 28:08.438
It means, "Moloch shall rise."

28:12.673 --> 28:16.475
No cell phone, no wallet,
nothing to track him with.

28:16.509 --> 28:19.756
This is Lieutenant Mills.
I need Captain Irving immediately.

28:19.791 --> 28:21.083
This is a priority request...

28:21.118 --> 28:22.548
Have you lost your mind?

28:22.582 --> 28:24.416
You're talking on a cell phone
after what he just told us?

28:24.451 --> 28:26.652
ABBIE: This is a crime scene.
That is a dead body.

28:26.686 --> 28:28.053
His friends are already on their way.

28:28.088 --> 28:30.222
JENNY: There are others out there
just like him.

28:30.257 --> 28:32.358
We have to assume they are everywhere.
Trust no one.

28:32.392 --> 28:34.593
Not the cops, not your boss.

28:34.628 --> 28:35.895
This is out of control, Jenny.

28:35.929 --> 28:37.029
We can't do this by ourselves.

28:37.063 --> 28:38.197
No, look.

28:38.231 --> 28:39.431
They were tracking me.

28:39.466 --> 28:40.866
Abbie.

28:40.901 --> 28:42.701
You got to trust me on this, okay?

28:42.736 --> 28:44.169
We need to do this ourselves.

28:44.204 --> 28:45.838
That is not the way

28:45.872 --> 28:47.539
- that we are doing this.
- Come on.

28:47.574 --> 28:49.742
You cannot hide behind
your badge this time, okay?

28:49.776 --> 28:51.877
If it weren't for me, you would
have half the National Guard

28:51.912 --> 28:53.212
- on your ass right now.
- Maybe I do.

28:53.246 --> 28:54.680
- You need to rethink...
- Jenny...

28:54.714 --> 28:57.716
I'm trying to concentrate!

28:59.452 --> 29:01.253
Mill Pond.

29:03.090 --> 29:06.125
Philipsburg Manor House.

29:06.159 --> 29:07.927
Wh...

29:07.961 --> 29:09.728
You...

29:09.763 --> 29:11.263
You remember it?

29:11.298 --> 29:12.765
He has a photographic memory.

29:12.799 --> 29:14.600
Once I've seen an image,

29:14.634 --> 29:17.002
recalling it is a rather simple matter.

29:18.772 --> 29:19.872
- North was that way.
- JENNY: Mm-mm.

29:19.906 --> 29:22.241
No, north is by the river.

29:22.275 --> 29:24.543
Wait, I know where the river is.
We used to swim there every Sunday.

29:24.577 --> 29:26.145
I remember there was a church.

29:26.179 --> 29:27.780
The Dutch Reformed Church.

29:27.814 --> 29:30.282
Southwest... here.

29:30.317 --> 29:32.584
Here.

29:34.521 --> 29:37.855
The last known whereabouts
of the Lesser Key of Solomon.

29:38.491 --> 29:41.427
Let's go get this damn thing.

30:32.312 --> 30:33.979
Here.

30:55.568 --> 30:58.971
May I inquire where you received
your combat training?

30:59.005 --> 31:00.472
You're...

31:00.507 --> 31:02.041
quite gifted.

31:02.075 --> 31:04.410
Weapons and demo training in Mexico.

31:04.444 --> 31:06.545
Sent a drug czar home in a box.

31:06.579 --> 31:09.848
Insurgent tactics in South Sudan.

31:09.883 --> 31:12.184
Warlords were stealing people's food.

31:12.218 --> 31:13.919
And women.

31:13.953 --> 31:18.056
So you're... a freedom fighter, then?

31:19.192 --> 31:22.895
I kind of learned long ago
that if you don't fight

31:22.929 --> 31:27.098
for the things you stand for,
you don't really stand for them.

31:35.075 --> 31:36.341
Well, she does make a compelling...

31:36.376 --> 31:38.077
Don't.

33:31.291 --> 33:32.291
Back away!

33:35.295 --> 33:36.295
Show me your hands!

34:41.629 --> 34:44.007
Drop the book
or your sister dies!

34:44.764 --> 34:46.688
Don't do it, Abbie!
Don't do it!

34:46.734 --> 34:49.177
- Lieutenant!
- MAN: Drop the book!

34:51.713 --> 34:53.069
Now!

34:53.072 --> 34:54.940
You got it.

34:58.612 --> 34:59.412
No!

35:30.444 --> 35:33.145
They left without a farewell.

35:35.149 --> 35:36.682
How impolite.

35:53.267 --> 35:55.334
I never got a chance to ask.

35:55.369 --> 35:58.471
What's with you and Prince William?

36:03.844 --> 36:07.680
You remember how Mom
used to drag us to Bible study,

36:07.714 --> 36:09.448
make us memorize passages?

36:09.483 --> 36:11.283
Chapter and verse.

36:13.453 --> 36:17.156
How much do you remember
in Revelation?

36:17.191 --> 36:19.425
"And I will give power

36:19.459 --> 36:22.695
"to my two witnesses,

36:22.729 --> 36:27.767
and they will prophesy
for 1,260 days."

36:27.801 --> 36:30.670
Revelation, chapter 11.

36:30.704 --> 36:33.439
You're telling me
that's you and him.

36:33.473 --> 36:36.275
I know it's...

36:36.310 --> 36:37.977
it's impossible to believe, but...

36:38.011 --> 36:40.213
I believe everything.

36:40.247 --> 36:42.782
Here's one for you.

36:42.816 --> 36:45.451
Psalm 94:1.

36:45.485 --> 36:49.388
"O Lord, the God of vengeance,

36:49.423 --> 36:53.392
let your glorious justice shine forth."

36:53.427 --> 36:55.394
It's poetic, isn't it?

36:55.429 --> 36:57.663
You turn your back on everything,

36:57.698 --> 37:01.867
and now you're picked to fight
the good fight.

37:04.204 --> 37:06.405
Are you just gonna keep
punishing me forever?

37:06.440 --> 37:08.674
I plan on it, yeah.

37:09.910 --> 37:12.979
Maybe that's what this is.

37:13.013 --> 37:17.683
It's my punishment
for turning my back on you.

37:17.718 --> 37:21.554
People say that, 
things happen for a reason.

37:21.588 --> 37:24.724
I haven't found one yet.

37:24.758 --> 37:28.527
'Cause we lost everything
in the forest that day.

37:28.562 --> 37:30.696
Our childhood,

37:30.731 --> 37:34.233
for a while, our sanity.

37:34.268 --> 37:37.937
We lost each other, Jenny.

37:37.971 --> 37:42.341
And I need you to know...

37:42.376 --> 37:45.344
that...

37:45.379 --> 37:47.713
I see who you really are.

37:49.716 --> 37:52.151
And I'm proud of you.

37:57.157 --> 38:00.526
We're all the family that we have left.

38:00.560 --> 38:04.130
You and me.

38:04.164 --> 38:06.098
That's it.

38:08.101 --> 38:11.604
So...

38:11.638 --> 38:13.806
I can't take back what I did.

38:16.310 --> 38:18.811
But I can try to make it right.

38:21.148 --> 38:22.915
What is this?

38:22.949 --> 38:25.751
Paperwork granting me
limited conservatorship

38:25.786 --> 38:28.788
over you and your legal affairs.

38:28.822 --> 38:30.323
They'll appoint you an attorney.

38:30.357 --> 38:32.391
We have to go to court,

38:32.426 --> 38:35.227
but if they say yes,
I can get you...

38:35.262 --> 38:37.997
out of there
in less than six months.

38:41.001 --> 38:42.835
It's a psychiatric hospital.

38:42.869 --> 38:44.103
I escaped.

38:44.137 --> 38:45.971
What the hell are you gonna say

38:46.006 --> 38:47.640
that's gonna convince
anyone of anything?

38:47.674 --> 38:49.809
They can't afford to let the state know.

38:49.843 --> 38:52.611
Otherwise, it'd mean that
their security is incompetent,

38:52.646 --> 38:54.813
they can't control their patients.

38:56.116 --> 38:59.785
Long story short, you are a
problem that they do not need.

39:01.088 --> 39:06.258
And I believe that we
can work together...

39:06.293 --> 39:09.762
to get some answers,
some real answers,

39:09.796 --> 39:12.498
for once.

39:18.705 --> 39:21.640
Corbin said...

39:21.675 --> 39:24.143
that one day you'd be back.

39:24.177 --> 39:27.045
When you were ready.

39:27.615 --> 39:31.584
Asked me
to find a way to forgive you.

39:35.155 --> 39:37.923
I said I didn't think I could.

39:40.694 --> 39:43.729
I'm sorry that it took me
so long to find you.

40:00.881 --> 40:02.882
Miss Mills.

40:06.787 --> 40:11.157
The Hessian's final words were,
"Moloch shall rise."

40:11.191 --> 40:15.060
The name is referenced in
several theological texts,

40:15.095 --> 40:17.930
notably Milton's Paradise Lost.

40:19.900 --> 40:25.037
"First Moloch, horrid King
besmear'd with blood...

40:25.071 --> 40:28.707
of human sacrifice, and parents tears."

40:28.742 --> 40:32.378
So called as the God-Demon
of child sacrifice

40:32.412 --> 40:35.414
who led a revolt of fellow demons
against Heaven.

40:36.617 --> 40:39.798
This is the creature you saw
in the forest, Miss Mills.

40:39.812 --> 40:42.060
The one who controls the Horseman,

40:42.134 --> 40:44.669
who guards Katrina.

40:45.559 --> 40:48.326
And now we know his name.
