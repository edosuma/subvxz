WEBVTT

00:03.836 --> 00:06.157
To discuss taking the firm
international. I want you there.

00:08.642 --> 00:12.144
Shane, the statement that you gave the
police, it doesn't line up with Taylor's.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.546
You saw the girl
who was staying at the motel?

00:14.615 --> 00:16.648
Yeah, but not Taylor.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.984
It was another girl
that was staying there.

00:19.119 --> 00:22.287
- Meet your new cellmate.
- You got the top bunk.

00:24.258 --> 00:27.326
I know, it's a lot to process.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.261
Tim wants to get
Shane's testimony

00:29.263 --> 00:32.264
as soon as possible.
Shane's not well.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.535
- Nice out here?
- Sorry?

00:36.604 --> 00:38.470
Don't you think it's beautiful?

00:38.605 --> 00:40.739
I suppose if you can
get over the creepy.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.141
I guess I don't
see it as creepy.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.544
Remember when we came
here for Halloween?

00:45.613 --> 00:47.780
That was creepy though.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.216
We're here.

00:51.351 --> 00:53.619
I...

00:53.754 --> 00:56.822
I found this while I was
walking the dog.

00:56.891 --> 00:58.891
I thought you might
want to see it.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.093
- You just happened to pass by?
- Yeah,

01:01.162 --> 01:04.663
after a quick...
database search.

01:06.366 --> 01:07.899
Looks like
the Hanleys have been here

01:07.968 --> 01:09.901
a while.

01:09.937 --> 01:12.104
My grandparents.
I was working with my dad

01:12.173 --> 01:14.806
on the Oswalt Power
and Coal Harbour Energy merger

01:14.875 --> 01:17.843
in Toronto. He didn't even
come to the funeral.

01:17.912 --> 01:20.111
He just bought this.

01:20.147 --> 01:23.782
"Survived by their loving son
David Richard Hanley."

01:23.917 --> 01:25.850
Of course he'd put his name
on their grave.

01:25.886 --> 01:28.653
- In a really big font.
- Yeah.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.523
It's nice here.

01:31.592 --> 01:35.394
Not a bad place to be buried.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.395
Yeah, it is.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.498
It's far too nice for him.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.871
Let me get to the point.
Is a settlement

01:45.940 --> 01:48.006
out of the question?
We had offered

01:48.075 --> 01:51.343
the defense a more than generous settlement,
which, I'm sure you can remember,

01:51.412 --> 01:54.045
they decided to turn into
a public stunt, consequently

01:54.115 --> 01:57.015
wasting the court's time. I'm
sure Mr. Bennett would agree

01:57.084 --> 01:59.151
that forcing
an innocent young woman

01:59.286 --> 02:01.086
to four years of prison
hardly qualifies

02:01.221 --> 02:03.155
as a settlement offer
and perhaps

02:03.290 --> 02:05.224
alternatively, a threat.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.492
Save it for trial,
Ms. Chan. Has anything else

02:07.528 --> 02:10.961
magically materialized
since then?

02:11.031 --> 02:14.233
We'd be willing
to entertain a settlement

02:14.235 --> 02:17.102
if it included
a full withdrawal of charges.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.971
I bet you would.

02:19.106 --> 02:22.374
A simple "no" would have
sufficed. Alright,

02:22.509 --> 02:25.377
are we in agreement
that we are trying

02:25.512 --> 02:28.880
the murder
of David Richard Hanley?

02:28.916 --> 02:31.716
- Yes, Your Honour.
- Ms. Chan, are we in agreement

02:31.785 --> 02:33.718
that the victim was murdered?

02:33.754 --> 02:35.720
Yes, Your Honour.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.857
We won't be pursuing
a strategy of self-defense.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.860
And that the murder weapon was the
bottle found at the crime scene?

02:45.032 --> 02:48.934
Was the blow to the anterior
base of the skull? Yes?

02:49.003 --> 02:51.603
Alright, are there
any other witnesses to add

02:51.639 --> 02:53.605
to the slate?
I'd like to do that now.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.874
No surprises.

02:55.943 --> 02:59.911
- Not from us, Your Honour.
- No, Your Honour.

02:59.947 --> 03:02.780
I expect you both
to be efficient,

03:02.816 --> 03:06.084
respectful and to play
by the rules.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.219
If there's anything else
either of you wants to say,

03:08.255 --> 03:10.155
now is the time.

03:14.962 --> 03:18.130
Good luck, Counsellors.
There's no turning back now.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.118
You know, I was thinking

03:40.120 --> 03:43.255
- while I was pissing. Beer?
- No.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.523
Maybe they tracked me
when I was on the bus.

03:45.525 --> 03:47.625
I mean, I paid cash,

03:47.661 --> 03:50.795
but all those buses have cameras
now. You know that, right?

03:50.831 --> 03:52.497
Shane...

03:59.607 --> 04:02.474
I gotta get to work
for a bit, so...

04:02.476 --> 04:04.409
you lay off the beer.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.545
Yeah. Thank you, bro.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.549
Moosejaw. It fits the pattern.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.024
Hey! Hey!

04:20.060 --> 04:21.760
You're in my seat.

04:21.829 --> 04:25.430
Sorry.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.933
Don't worry about it, cupcake.

04:46.253 --> 04:49.121
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.989
I picked up the mail.

04:52.026 --> 04:54.059
- Thanks.
- It looks like

04:54.128 --> 04:56.595
- it's mostly junk.
- Yeah.

05:01.268 --> 05:04.803
So the pretrial conference
went as expected.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.405
Yeah. Thanks for that.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.674
Would have been great
to know what's going on

05:09.677 --> 05:12.878
with Shane's testimony.
Shane's not an option.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.013
But if what Owen said
about the hair sample's true,

05:15.049 --> 05:17.015
we can move
on evidence tampering.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.017
That's true.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.159
Look, if this is...

05:29.897 --> 05:31.896
If this is about the kiss,

05:31.965 --> 05:34.833
then I am... I didn't mean

05:34.968 --> 05:36.835
to force you. I am sorry. Don't.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.971
Don't apologize. It's not...

05:41.909 --> 05:44.843
I just have to focus
on the case.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.179
OK.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.384
Then we're running out of time.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.519
Shane's testimony
is our strongest move.

05:54.654 --> 05:56.721
Joanna, Shane's testimony
is no longer in play.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.057
Billy, what is going on?

06:06.567 --> 06:08.667
Hey.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.936
Slow down. Just...

06:11.972 --> 06:13.872
I hear you, but I left you

06:14.007 --> 06:16.674
five minutes ago. It's not...

06:16.744 --> 06:19.478
No, OK, fine.
I'll be right there.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.682
I'll be back.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.061
- Is that the way you think?!
- I'm not disagreeing.

07:10.130 --> 07:13.765
- Who sent you? Who sent you?!
- Easy, Shane! - Who sent you?!

07:13.900 --> 07:17.335
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, hey! That's Joanna.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.670
Joanna. You know Joanna.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.606
She shouldn't be here.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.775
You should not be here.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.956
Why didn't you tell me?

07:38.091 --> 07:40.625
I guess I was just

07:40.627 --> 07:42.727
hoping for it
to be anything else.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.298
I am so sorry, Billy.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.835
What's happening with Shane

07:49.970 --> 07:51.970
is brutal,
I can't even imagine...

07:53.607 --> 07:57.108
but Luna is on trial now,

07:57.110 --> 07:59.511
and she could go to prison
for the rest of her life.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.916
You're right. From here
on out, I'll be honest.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.654
Joanna, I need you
to be honest with yourself.

08:09.789 --> 08:12.790
This isn't just Luna's trial;
This is the trial

08:12.826 --> 08:14.793
for the murder of your father.
Don't.

08:14.928 --> 08:18.230
You're strong, but pretending
to be fine with this is crazy.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.212
I need to know you're good
and not just pretending to be;

08:22.236 --> 08:24.469
Otherwise it could jeopardize...
I'm good.

08:24.604 --> 08:27.150
What if you suddenly realize you're not
good right in the middle of the trial?

08:27.174 --> 08:28.807
No. I said, "I'm good,"
which means I'm good.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.476
Joanna, his ashes are still
in the trunk of your car.

08:35.815 --> 08:38.650
Joanna.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.752
You know,
I hadn't cried in years

09:47.887 --> 09:49.820
before I came back here,
and now it's like

09:49.856 --> 09:51.956
my eyes are permanently leaking.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.092
Millwood does have that effect.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.161
Although in fairness,
this last bout

09:56.163 --> 09:58.163
might have been the benzene.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.434
Too soon.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.705
Back where it all started.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.775
He was so horrible,

10:10.777 --> 10:12.777
to so many people.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.479
And for most of my life,

10:15.515 --> 10:17.649
he was my hero.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.187
Doesn't that make me horrible?

10:23.256 --> 10:24.456
No.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.460
He was your father.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.104
I miss him, Billy.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.541
And it sucks.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.977
- It does suck.
- I can't even put him to rest

10:45.979 --> 10:48.480
because the person on trial
for killing him didn't do it.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.951
We're out of options.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.820
We can still win this.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.933
No. We have to give the jury
someone better than Luna.

10:57.957 --> 10:59.958
We can't change strategies
this close to trial,

11:00.093 --> 11:03.094
that's suicide.
You have seen their case...

11:03.229 --> 11:05.497
we're going to lose.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.366
The only way left to clear Luna,
whether I like or not,

11:08.435 --> 11:10.568
is to get justice for my father.

11:10.637 --> 11:14.105
They know that we are
out of time, and I know

11:14.107 --> 11:16.441
it's a shot in the dark,
but it is our only shot.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.912
Luna's only real shot.

11:23.983 --> 11:26.450
Where are you going?

11:26.486 --> 11:29.421
Let's go find your girl
with the American ID.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.127
So you did test the DNA,

11:36.262 --> 11:38.663
and the hair was a non-match
to the accused?

11:38.665 --> 11:41.299
Refresh my memory,
who did you give the results to?

11:43.403 --> 11:45.970
That's what I thought.

11:47.774 --> 11:49.741
You're riding with me
today, Boone.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.543
- Yeah, but I'm...
- Let's go.

11:54.814 --> 11:57.214
Crime scene photos,
eyewitness statements...

11:57.250 --> 11:59.462
- We've already seen all this.
- We were looking for evidence

11:59.486 --> 12:01.685
of police negligence,
procedural loopholes,

12:01.722 --> 12:03.687
we were looking
for why Luna wasn't there;

12:03.724 --> 12:06.557
Now we look for who was.

12:06.626 --> 12:08.946
Alright, we know all the main
suspects that had something

12:09.028 --> 12:11.563
against your father.
Throw that list out.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.098
This wasn't premeditated.
Whoever did this used

12:14.134 --> 12:15.967
the bottle that he brought
into the room.

12:15.969 --> 12:19.070
It was... it was improvised.
They were surprised.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.406
Caught in the act?
Caught in the act of what?

12:25.078 --> 12:28.846
Is everything OK? Yeah. It's
not important right now.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.783
OK, so your father walked in
on them. They would have heard

12:31.852 --> 12:33.863
his key in the door and hid,
and the only place to hide

12:33.887 --> 12:36.454
is the bathroom. He had time
enough to put the bottle down,

12:36.589 --> 12:38.501
but not enough time to pour
himself a drink. And the fight

12:38.525 --> 12:40.725
didn't happen in the bathroom.
Wait. No, no fight.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.528
The strike happened at
the anterior base of the skull.

12:43.597 --> 12:46.464
He was hit from behind. Right.
So he walks into the room,

12:46.599 --> 12:48.666
puts down the bottle, and then
he has to turn to see...

12:48.668 --> 12:51.069
He sees something
that tips him off.

12:57.744 --> 13:00.011
This. His computer.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.213
- What about it?
- In corporate law,

13:02.215 --> 13:04.349
confidentiality is king;

13:04.484 --> 13:07.752
When my father went to go buy his Scotch,
he wouldn't have left his computer out

13:07.887 --> 13:09.865
on the table, let alone open,
which means someone else did.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.867
He knew someone was in
the room 'cause his computer

13:11.891 --> 13:13.903
wasn't where he left it.
He had a secure login key.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.327
So the only way to access his
files was through his computer.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.033
Wanted this.

13:22.102 --> 13:25.036
OK, so if it's that secure,
we're gonna need an expert.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.971
And Millwood's fresh
out of those,

13:27.106 --> 13:29.040
so we'll have to go to Winnipeg.

13:29.175 --> 13:31.242
- I think you should stay here.
- No way.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.644
This isn't a "I need
to do this on my own" thing.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.980
Shane needs help.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.382
Billy, trust me, don't wait
until it's too late.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.517
It's the 11th hour,
all hands on deck.

13:40.554 --> 13:43.921
I know a guy. I will be fine.

13:48.829 --> 13:52.130
- Good luck.
- You too.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.736
I need to talk to you.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.939
I'm sorry.

14:02.876 --> 14:05.677
I haven't always been
the best brother.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.612
You needed...

14:07.681 --> 14:10.748
more help, more than I was
willing to give.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.184
You're a good brother.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.220
- Trust me, I'm not.
- Well, you are

14:16.289 --> 14:19.223
the only one I have,
so only and best.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.793
Come with me
to see Dr. Faulkner.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.165
No.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.234
I'm fine, thank you.
Shane, look around,

14:29.369 --> 14:31.168
- this isn't fine.
- What?

14:31.170 --> 14:33.204
What isn't fine?
What isn't fine?!

14:33.273 --> 14:35.974
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down man.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.842
I'm working
through all of this shit,

14:37.977 --> 14:39.843
all of it, so I can
save your life!

14:39.880 --> 14:41.524
- Hey, I'm just trying to help.
- Listen to me.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.580
- I'm listening.
- No, you're listening,

14:43.617 --> 14:46.451
but you're not understanding everything
that's going on! OK! OK! OK!

14:50.156 --> 14:52.156
OK, I believe you.

14:54.794 --> 14:57.128
We're in trouble.

14:57.197 --> 15:00.131
What do you want to do? OK, there's
a campsite outside Selkirk.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.067
We go there, we lay low.

15:03.202 --> 15:05.370
- Shane, I can't do that.
- Why not?

15:08.208 --> 15:10.675
I have a client.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.878
He's "connected." Let me try
to set up a face-to-face,

15:14.013 --> 15:16.280
see if I could broker
some kind of peace.

15:16.349 --> 15:19.484
He's "connected"?

15:21.588 --> 15:23.687
And you think he would do that?

15:23.723 --> 15:25.623
Dude, I would never

15:25.758 --> 15:27.825
say anything about what I know.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.760
If... if they know
that I can be trusted...

15:29.829 --> 15:31.895
- Yeah.
- I would never say

15:31.932 --> 15:34.565
anything, you know that, right?
I know, Shane, I know.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.970
Yes, Billy boy.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.306
Yes, yes, yes! Do it.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.875
Do it this time. It's crazy.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.528
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

16:04.564 --> 16:06.597
I just...

16:06.599 --> 16:08.466
I'm not supposed to be in here.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.534
Well, get used to it.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.071
And don't ever let anyone

16:13.073 --> 16:15.539
see you cry. But I didn't do it.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.008
No one cares
if you're guilty or not.

16:18.044 --> 16:20.678
You're in here now,
so just deal with it!

16:20.747 --> 16:22.679
Why are you yelling at me?

16:28.154 --> 16:30.621
Stop crying, OK?

16:35.762 --> 16:37.462
Good.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.245
Wait here.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.981
I'll, I'll make sure it's safe.

16:57.050 --> 17:00.251
Careful, man. Billy...

17:00.253 --> 17:03.254
thank you. I know you're
sticking your neck out for me.

17:03.323 --> 17:06.057
Of course.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.159
You're my brother.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.732
Well, Billy, I'm hesitant

17:15.769 --> 17:18.068
to make a remote diagnosis,
but it sounds

17:18.104 --> 17:20.738
like schizophrenia.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.608
He thinks he's completely fine.

17:23.609 --> 17:25.542
You know, that's anosognosia.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.212
They... they believe
their delusions are real.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.715
There's a few in-patient units
I found in Winnipeg.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.596
They said he wouldn't have to stay there long
term, just 'til he got it under control.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.354
It's not that simple, you need
more than a diagnosis to get in.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.689
There's only enough beds
for the emergencies,

17:38.725 --> 17:41.292
so unless he's a danger
to himself

17:41.427 --> 17:43.360
or a danger to other people,

17:43.396 --> 17:45.374
then we're gonna have to find
other ways to treat him.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.533
- Alright, like that?
- Weekly sessions, medication.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.513
You don't understand.
He's completely lost touch.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.370
I know, Billy.

17:52.505 --> 17:56.173
Just take it one step
at a time. You go get Shane,

17:56.209 --> 17:58.375
and we'll see what we can do.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.191
Shane?

18:24.403 --> 18:27.605
Whoa! Hehe, Joanna, 'sup?

18:27.674 --> 18:29.607
What's up
with the secret bunker?

18:29.742 --> 18:31.654
- She shouldn't be here.
- But she needs our help.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.844
She wouldn't help us
when we needed her last time.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.258
- Well, we owe her a couple.
- No, you don't owe me anything,

18:36.282 --> 18:41.619
but I do need your help.
This is a mistake.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.491
Is that about
the security inquiry?

18:47.527 --> 18:49.693
I don't know. She needs
to blow off some steam.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.196
- How can I help you?
- Um...

18:54.434 --> 18:56.701
I need you to

18:56.703 --> 18:59.236
hack into this and tell me
if anything was taken.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.639
Yeah, that kind of goes

19:01.641 --> 19:04.375
against my whole privacy thing.
It was my father's.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.579
I think it's connected.
I have no idea how,

19:08.648 --> 19:10.714
but my gut says
it has something to do

19:10.750 --> 19:15.052
with what's in this computer.
I don't have time...

19:15.088 --> 19:18.656
I'm out of options, Noah.

19:18.658 --> 19:22.727
I get it, and I know this is
my sister, but we're talking

19:22.862 --> 19:24.662
about justice.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.731
How can you call yourself
a soldier for good

19:26.733 --> 19:30.067
if you stand by and watch
an innocent person go to jail

19:30.103 --> 19:31.936
for the rest of her life?
It's also against the law.

19:31.938 --> 19:35.405
Yeah, well,
sometimes, justice and the law

19:35.441 --> 19:37.408
aren't the same thing.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.284
Watch the Bombers' game
last night?

19:47.320 --> 19:50.154
- Highlights.
- Shame.

19:50.289 --> 19:52.757
Real shame.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.594
Out with it, Beckbie.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.831
I was looking
in the evidence locker,

20:00.833 --> 20:04.435
and something was missing.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.437
The hair sample
from the Hanley murder.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.574
I know you received
the test results.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.643
I know it was a non-match.

20:12.778 --> 20:14.712
Non-match doesn't mean anything.

20:14.847 --> 20:18.616
I think you brought it to Mercer,
and he told you to bury it.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.319
And why would he do that?

20:22.355 --> 20:25.656
Might not prove anything,
but it also doesn't fit

20:25.791 --> 20:28.960
his narrative, so best to keep
it out of the minds of the jury.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.898
But, Jason...

20:37.203 --> 20:40.938
I know you're
a good guy, good cop,

20:41.073 --> 20:44.275
but if you keep toeing the party line.
Careful what you accuse of.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.110
I'm just trying
to get to the truth.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.390
- Not gonna rat out another cop.
- Maybe you should think

20:48.414 --> 20:50.192
about why you became a cop
in the first place.

20:50.216 --> 20:52.483
And maybe you should think
about toeing the party line,

20:52.552 --> 20:55.419
for once. I am sick and tired

20:55.554 --> 20:58.555
of your holier-than-thou shtick.
You ever think we could do

20:58.557 --> 21:00.717
more good if we were all rolling
in the same direction?

21:08.434 --> 21:10.568
Get in the car!

21:10.703 --> 21:13.571
You need to see something.

21:32.258 --> 21:34.058
Beckbie, I...

21:38.598 --> 21:40.965
Pass here!

21:43.002 --> 21:44.935
- Hey, Owen!
- Hi!

21:48.474 --> 21:52.076
Hey, it's alright.
Hockey sticks!

21:52.078 --> 21:54.812
Alright, who wants a basketball? You want
a basketball? Soccer ball? Soccer ball?

21:54.814 --> 21:56.814
Here you go. That.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.150
You got this. There you go.

21:59.285 --> 22:00.785
- Thanks!
- Now, go play.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.627
I actually grew up
in this neighbourhood.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.896
We used to come running

22:12.965 --> 22:14.898
when the cops would come.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.700
They'd give us food,

22:16.769 --> 22:18.702
candy, toys sometimes,

22:18.771 --> 22:21.505
and they looked strong,

22:21.640 --> 22:23.441
kind.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.909
It's one of the reasons
why I wanted to become a cop.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.179
And now, I gotta

22:28.181 --> 22:30.714
hide my badge
just to come around here.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.254
Keep toeing
the party line, Jason...

22:37.256 --> 22:40.056
we'll see where it gets you.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.795
- I know.
- Look, this system is

22:44.797 --> 22:46.942
very sophisticated. It's even
gonna take me a while to...

22:46.966 --> 22:50.467
Got something.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.736
Last document was exported

22:52.805 --> 22:55.539
at 10 p.m.
The night he was killed.

22:58.244 --> 23:00.878
Looks like a contract from a...

23:00.880 --> 23:04.215
real estate company called
"Caron Property Group."

23:04.350 --> 23:07.218
This can't be right.

23:07.353 --> 23:08.885
What is it?

23:08.921 --> 23:11.422
It's a contract between
Caron Property Group and...

23:11.491 --> 23:13.624
Lovand.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.028
Are you saying
that my father's murder

23:18.164 --> 23:20.498
could be linked
to the Lovand case?

23:27.173 --> 23:30.641
Ir facial recognition
software into security cameras

23:30.710 --> 23:33.844
at two of the highest-traffic
malls in Toronto.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.980
And there are addendums
mentioning other contracts.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.916
A university,
a couple of private schools.

23:39.051 --> 23:42.185
It's all very hush-hush.
Every third word is NDA.

23:42.221 --> 23:43.987
I mean, they would do
practically anything

23:44.023 --> 23:45.923
to keep this quiet.
It'd ruin them.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.924
Keep what quiet?

23:47.960 --> 23:49.927
We actually found

23:49.996 --> 23:51.995
a contract
on Joanna's dad's computer.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.665
He was working
on a deal with Lovand.

23:54.734 --> 23:57.000
There. You got what
you wanted, now leave us alone!

23:57.069 --> 24:00.070
- I'm not finished yet.
- She's putting us in danger!

24:00.072 --> 24:02.673
I am seeing this through.
End of story!

24:02.675 --> 24:05.709
Just relax for a minute.

24:11.550 --> 24:14.018
The good news is
whoever is hacking in

24:14.153 --> 24:16.020
didn't have a chance
to cover their tracks.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.088
The security system
has a login menu

24:18.124 --> 24:20.084
that takes a picture
of whoever's trying to access

24:20.159 --> 24:22.759
the profile. The hacker must
have been interrupted

24:22.761 --> 24:24.962
before they saw that. Bad news?

24:25.031 --> 24:27.230
Bad news is the security
system's a lot harder

24:27.266 --> 24:29.706
to get into than the computer.
Software is gonna take a while.

24:29.835 --> 24:31.902
Look, Joanna, I'm sorry,

24:31.938 --> 24:33.849
OK, I should have known
that they would have done this.

24:33.873 --> 24:36.039
No, don't apologize.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.108
You may have given me
the evidence I need to free

24:38.110 --> 24:42.079
my sister.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.314
NO! Wait!

24:43.449 --> 24:45.716
Do not answer that.

24:45.785 --> 24:48.986
- Please?
- OK, I won't.

25:04.403 --> 25:07.004
Hey.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.873
Yeah. Sorry,
you think you can keep

25:09.876 --> 25:13.143
an eye out for my truck?

25:13.145 --> 25:15.078
Something like that.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.281
If your truck got stolen,
you need to call it in.

25:17.350 --> 25:20.150
Yeah... I need you
to keep this quiet.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.388
No, not yet. I'll let you know.

25:27.159 --> 25:30.160
Here, it's yours,

25:30.296 --> 25:32.229
you can take it.

25:41.374 --> 25:44.375
- I got a Frisbee!
- Nice!

25:45.844 --> 25:47.777
Let's get out of here.

25:47.813 --> 25:50.247
Even if what you think
might have happened did,

25:50.382 --> 25:52.249
there'd be no way to prove it.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.584
But if I were you,

25:54.620 --> 25:56.554
I'd look into Neil Bellegarde.

25:59.425 --> 26:01.858
Thank you, Jason.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.661
This explains
the new office space.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.596
- We were gonna call.
- But I told you

26:05.665 --> 26:08.666
I wasn't your lawyer anymore.
Look, you said

26:08.801 --> 26:11.201
that they would strike again,
and they did.

26:11.203 --> 26:13.382
They used their ties with the
government to make an example

26:13.406 --> 26:15.472
out of me. And once the Feds
make up their mind...

26:15.508 --> 26:17.207
You know I couldn't help you
evade the federal authorities.

26:17.209 --> 26:20.543
- I told you she's a problem.
- I am not the problem.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.724
You're part of the system,
so you play by their rules.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.816
The system is rigged,
and their rules are rigged.

26:27.987 --> 26:31.422
Joanna, do what you gotta do.

26:31.557 --> 26:34.091
You've already lost enough.

26:38.965 --> 26:41.031
Keep working
on the security system.

26:41.067 --> 26:44.301
I'll find what the Feds
have on you. If they have

26:44.436 --> 26:46.703
made a single misstep,
I will find it.

26:46.739 --> 26:49.707
- I can't ask you to do that.
- No, this is my choice.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.510
But I'm going to have
to make some calls.

26:59.985 --> 27:01.785
Hey, put that away.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.721
You can't be doing
that kind of thing.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.790
If you do what I say,
then you'll be OK,

27:06.925 --> 27:09.927
- you'll survive.
- Thanks,

27:10.062 --> 27:11.995
but I don't want to be like you.

27:12.031 --> 27:14.865
I know you think that you're
one of the good ones

27:15.000 --> 27:16.933
and maybe you used to be,

27:16.969 --> 27:19.402
but I don't want to be hard.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.404
I'm not tough,

27:21.440 --> 27:23.607
and I sure as hell
don't ever want

27:23.742 --> 27:25.943
to be OK with this place.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.011
I'm just trying to help you.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.948
I appreciate it, I do,

27:31.984 --> 27:34.818
but I don't need
that kind of help.

27:47.633 --> 27:50.033
Owen?

27:52.138 --> 27:54.038
Where?

27:56.108 --> 27:58.108
Got it. Thank you.

28:03.616 --> 28:06.717
OK, scrambled. They'll think
you're calling from Cambodia.

28:06.852 --> 28:09.152
- That was quick.
- Yeah, well...

28:09.188 --> 28:11.522
just get the charges dropped
and then leave.

28:11.657 --> 28:13.724
I will do my best.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.859
No, you have to do
better than that. The only way

28:15.994 --> 28:18.128
he's gonna survive is
if you get the charges dropped.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.130
- Anything can happen at trial.
- You don't get it;

28:20.166 --> 28:22.666
He's not going to trial.

28:28.507 --> 28:30.473
He's been
weirdly calm through all this.

28:30.509 --> 28:33.343
So I asked him about it,
and he said he'd die

28:33.479 --> 28:36.280
before he stepped foot
in a courtroom again.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.263
Joanna, you can't
go dark like that.

29:26.332 --> 29:29.800
I'm sorry. Just, funeral stuff.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.469
We are about to open
an office in Singapore,

29:32.604 --> 29:35.472
and you're supposed
to be the managing partner,

29:35.607 --> 29:38.208
so let me ask you, Joanna,
are you ready to plant

29:38.343 --> 29:40.611
the Steadman-Lavery flag
in Asia?

29:45.050 --> 29:48.485
Of course. Thank you.

29:48.554 --> 29:51.021
Has Noah checked in?

29:51.156 --> 29:53.089
No.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.094
I know.

29:57.096 --> 30:00.497
It would reflect
very poorly on us.

30:04.804 --> 30:08.244
- It's going to be fine! - No, it's definitely not fine!
- What are you talking about?!

30:10.276 --> 30:12.376
I'm leaving.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.378
Whoa, where are you going?

30:14.513 --> 30:16.647
- Out of my way! I'm leaving!
- OK, wait!

30:16.782 --> 30:19.216
Noah, did you find something?
I don't have time for this.

30:19.285 --> 30:22.218
Already.

30:22.254 --> 30:25.255
Shit!

30:25.291 --> 30:27.791
- They found us.
- We gotta leave now!

30:31.931 --> 30:34.431
No. No! No!

30:34.500 --> 30:37.501
- We should split up.
- Noah!

30:38.971 --> 30:41.438
Wait!

30:43.742 --> 30:45.375
Run!

31:03.796 --> 31:05.896
What the hell was that?
How did they find us?

31:05.965 --> 31:09.433
- It was you! - No, I didn't. I swear.
- We were fine until you

31:09.435 --> 31:11.835
showed up. Everything was fine
until you came into our lives.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.971
I didn't do this, Mara!

31:13.973 --> 31:16.039
I am trying to find out
who murdered my father,

31:16.174 --> 31:18.107
you know that's true.

31:18.143 --> 31:20.644
Why would I call the cops on
the one person who can help me?

31:26.485 --> 31:28.485
Thanks for grabbing that.

31:31.123 --> 31:32.890
Yeah, right.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.793
I could help you with that.

31:36.829 --> 31:39.062
With?

31:39.064 --> 31:42.332
Your father's computer,
I could help you get into it.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.334
Yeah, that'd be great,

31:44.370 --> 31:46.670
but shouldn't we find Noah?

31:46.739 --> 31:49.472
There's no way to trace him.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.408
- Track the phone.
- You think after

31:51.543 --> 31:53.810
all this time, he'd have
a phone we could track?

31:53.879 --> 31:55.578
No. Track my phone.

31:55.648 --> 31:58.615
It's in his bag.

31:58.750 --> 32:02.152
You know Bellegarde's death
was ruled accidental?

32:02.154 --> 32:05.221
Look at this.
They barely investigated.

32:05.257 --> 32:08.091
Don't. Don't feel sorry
for yourself.

32:08.226 --> 32:11.094
- You don't know what it feels like.
- You're right.

32:11.229 --> 32:13.096
And I never will,
but we can't keep

32:13.231 --> 32:15.310
having the same conversation
about the Millwood Police force.

32:15.334 --> 32:18.768
WHAT am I supposed to do? It's a
cop's word against a dead man!

32:18.837 --> 32:20.604
You're not gonna
solve it with rage.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.042
You need proof.

32:27.212 --> 32:30.647
How would you do it? I know,

32:30.716 --> 32:32.716
but if you were
that kind of cop,

32:32.785 --> 32:35.385
how would you do it?
I don't know.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.921
Come on, try.

32:37.923 --> 32:40.891
What would you do?

32:43.562 --> 32:45.462
I would have
followed him, I guess.

32:45.597 --> 32:46.796
OK.

32:46.832 --> 32:50.200
Waited for
some kind of violation.

32:50.269 --> 32:52.402
- Or a...
- Or...?

32:55.040 --> 32:58.408
I would have seen if he had any
outstanding warrants against him.

32:58.444 --> 33:01.611
Can you check
if they searched for anything?

33:01.613 --> 33:05.415
They log all the searches
at the station.

33:07.786 --> 33:09.552
You're the best.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.555
I know.

33:25.437 --> 33:28.305
- What are these?
- You're right, I can't help you

33:28.440 --> 33:31.775
be tough, and I can't help you
deal with this place

33:31.777 --> 33:36.179
because I am barely keeping
my own head above water,

33:36.248 --> 33:38.648
but this is what I can do.

33:40.285 --> 33:42.585
Criminal liability
consists of two parts

33:42.654 --> 33:44.754
The act and the intent.
Your public defender

33:44.823 --> 33:46.690
is gonna try and cop a deal
as soon as he can,

33:46.825 --> 33:48.725
and then you'll be stuck here.

33:48.794 --> 33:51.395
So if you want to get out
of this place

33:51.530 --> 33:55.064
before it changes you -
because it will -

33:55.100 --> 33:57.400
then it's up to you.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.269
Us.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.673
Who taught you all this?

34:05.344 --> 34:06.877
My sister.

34:13.552 --> 34:16.353
Don't worry, we'll find him.

34:19.424 --> 34:21.190
He's headed to the airport.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.911
Volunteering
for the night shift?

34:42.047 --> 34:44.714
Yeah. Couldn't sleep.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.783
Nothing puts me out
faster than paperwork.

34:48.786 --> 34:51.021
Tell me about it.

35:10.408 --> 35:13.944
One ticket to anywhere
leaving now.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.183
There!

35:25.224 --> 35:27.424
Noah. Noah...

35:27.426 --> 35:29.492
I don't get it,
it says he's still here!

35:59.391 --> 36:01.191
I'll sip a couple of Millbrews.

36:07.065 --> 36:08.665
Yo!

36:11.469 --> 36:12.936
Billy?

36:21.012 --> 36:22.946
What's up?

36:25.617 --> 36:27.750
Billy boy...

36:27.819 --> 36:29.519
what's up?

36:34.626 --> 36:36.359
You know I love you, right?

36:43.835 --> 36:46.869
Which is why
I've been covering your ass

36:46.905 --> 36:48.971
- your entire life.
- What?

36:49.007 --> 36:51.018
Hell, I've been trying
to protect you, but it's clear

36:51.042 --> 36:54.282
it's not helping. So I'm gonna tell you
something once, and I need you to hear me.

36:55.781 --> 36:58.048
Dad had a daughter
he could be proud of.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.050
He had me.

37:00.185 --> 37:02.986
We were good kids. But not you.

37:03.055 --> 37:04.820
You embarrassed him.

37:04.856 --> 37:06.790
- That's not true.
- You embarrassed him,

37:06.792 --> 37:09.192
and it is pathetic
watching you follow him around

37:09.327 --> 37:10.926
trying to get his approval.
Shut up.

37:10.963 --> 37:13.463
No, you listen. You listen

37:13.465 --> 37:15.398
to me, alright? He left 'cause

37:15.467 --> 37:17.600
you were too much to handle.
Shut your mouth.

37:17.603 --> 37:20.203
And you want to know why
I won't forgive him?

37:20.338 --> 37:22.272
Because he's stuck me with you!

37:22.341 --> 37:24.319
What are you doing, man?!
I don't know what you're doing!

37:24.343 --> 37:27.343
Hey, look at me! Look at me!
I've never agreed

37:27.379 --> 37:30.280
with Dad about anything,

37:30.282 --> 37:32.282
except you.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.651
- You're weak.
- No, I'm not.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.953
- Yeah? Prove it.
- No, I'm not!

37:36.955 --> 37:38.755
- Yeah? Come on, prove it!
- Stop it!

37:38.757 --> 37:40.590
Prove it!

37:40.592 --> 37:43.193
Prove it!

37:56.642 --> 37:58.942
You want some peas?

38:03.115 --> 38:06.849
Yo, I...

38:06.918 --> 38:08.852
You didn't mean
any of that, right?

38:08.987 --> 38:11.587
I just took it too far?

38:11.623 --> 38:14.124
I need you to know
that I love you, Shane.

38:14.126 --> 38:16.593
I do, man.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.995
I do and I'm sorry. I'll...

38:18.997 --> 38:20.996
I'll be better.
I'll be a better brother.

38:21.033 --> 38:24.200
Look, it's OK.

38:24.269 --> 38:27.537
I know you're just mad
'cause of the truck.

38:33.312 --> 38:35.245
Becks?

38:37.215 --> 38:39.949
What's he doing here?
What are you doing?

38:41.887 --> 38:44.321
Are you sure about this?

38:46.892 --> 38:49.091
Sure about what?

38:49.127 --> 38:50.893
What's going on?

38:50.929 --> 38:53.129
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Becks, Becks,
what are you doing, man?

38:53.164 --> 38:55.164
What are you doing?! Billy?

38:55.233 --> 38:57.100
Billy, what's going on, man?
Let's go.

38:57.169 --> 38:58.634
- Billy?
- Let's go.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.837
BILLY, WHAT'S
GOING ON, MAN? BILLY!

39:00.972 --> 39:04.106
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO
TO ME, BILLY?

39:04.142 --> 39:06.041
BILLY, IT'S NOT GOOD!

39:06.078 --> 39:08.378
THEY'RE GONNA TRY
AND KILL ME, BILLY!

39:08.513 --> 39:10.446
BILLY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

39:10.515 --> 39:12.982
Billy! Billy, please!

39:13.018 --> 39:15.151
Billy! No!

39:36.408 --> 39:40.143
I can't believe he's gone.
You must be pretty torn up.

39:41.646 --> 39:44.347
The movement's bigger than us.

39:44.482 --> 39:47.617
- I guess so.
- I can get started on your computer now.

39:47.686 --> 39:50.453
Unless you have another
computer expert in mind.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.422
No,

39:52.557 --> 39:55.291
I appreciate it, I just...

39:55.327 --> 39:57.694
didn't think you liked me much.

39:57.696 --> 40:00.830
What's that got to do
with anything?

40:00.899 --> 40:03.632
OK. Well, thank you.

40:03.668 --> 40:06.169
I mean it. You're helping
an innocent woman.

40:08.673 --> 40:10.440
It's my boss.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.442
It's OK. They were after Noah,

40:12.511 --> 40:14.444
and your phone's
still scrambled.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.424
I'm gonna go to the basement
and get some tools.

40:16.448 --> 40:18.648
OK. Hi.

40:18.783 --> 40:22.184
Joanna, I'm proud of you.

40:22.220 --> 40:24.120
For calling the Feds on Noah.

40:27.692 --> 40:29.659
I never called the Feds.

40:36.535 --> 40:40.069
Joanna? Joanna, can you hear me?

40:40.105 --> 40:43.139
I'm telling you

40:43.208 --> 40:45.675
I never called the Feds,
I only called you.

40:45.810 --> 40:48.211
OK, well, that's weird.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.880
Well, who... Did someone else
have your phone?

40:50.916 --> 40:53.683
The only other person was...

41:04.963 --> 41:08.163
This whole contract thing is
pretty strange, don't you think?

41:08.200 --> 41:10.633
Who would go that far

41:10.669 --> 41:14.370
to get the contract
off of his computer?

41:14.372 --> 41:16.439
Lovand.

41:16.441 --> 41:18.374
But they would have
their own copies,

41:18.443 --> 41:22.311
so why would they want
these ones?

41:22.380 --> 41:24.380
Maybe they were just
tying up loose ends.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.853
Maybe.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.860
Hey, what were you and Noah
arguing about?

41:37.929 --> 41:41.597
When the cops showed up,
I forgot to ask.

41:41.633 --> 41:43.967
Just about the cops.

41:47.272 --> 41:49.472
But that was
before they showed up.

41:50.942 --> 41:54.277
I mean
about the whole situation.

41:56.515 --> 41:58.515
That makes sense.

42:00.085 --> 42:02.451
You would have done
anything for him.

42:02.521 --> 42:05.288
For the movement.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.159
Of course.

42:10.295 --> 42:13.562
Of course, you would have
done anything for the movement.

42:31.349 --> 42:34.050
- Are you alright?
- You find anything?

42:36.321 --> 42:38.321
This is gonna take some time.

42:40.525 --> 42:44.193
Umm... I need
to get back to the office.

42:44.195 --> 42:46.462
Maybe I'll grab the computer
when I get back later.

42:46.598 --> 42:48.764
I thought you said
you were out of time.

42:48.800 --> 42:52.535
- Yes, I am.
- So I'll keep working on it and then we'll get it done faster.

42:56.874 --> 42:58.941
Of course.

42:58.944 --> 43:00.877
I will call you when I'm done.

43:00.879 --> 43:04.480
Fine.

43:11.890 --> 43:14.624
Pick up. Billy, pick up.
