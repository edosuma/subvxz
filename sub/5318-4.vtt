Look, she's smart.

38:12.749 --> 38:14.910
She wasn't gonna be
distracted for long.
(CELLPHONE BEEPING)

38:15.043 --> 38:16.954
We'll get another one.
We're running
out of time.

38:17.463 --> 38:18.452
(SIGHS)

38:19.047 --> 38:20.753
(BEEPING CONTINUES)

38:21.800 --> 38:23.040
(BEEPING STOPS)

38:23.177 --> 38:24.337
She's near
the building?

38:25.220 --> 38:27.552
Yeah, let me talk to her.
I'll get her to leave.

38:27.639 --> 38:28.719
Take care of it.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.513
No, you don't!
Tonkin, take it easy.

38:30.601 --> 38:32.262
You, stand down.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.975
Put that down.

38:36.106 --> 38:37.721
Tonkin?

38:41.445 --> 38:42.560
Okay.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.695
You wanna know
what we're doing?

38:49.912 --> 38:51.368
We're building
a portal.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.029
A lifeboat.

38:54.541 --> 38:55.826
To rescue our people.

38:55.918 --> 38:57.624
They escape our time,
they come here.

38:57.794 --> 39:01.036
Now, there's hundreds
of names on that list.
Take a look.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.006
Now you see?

39:06.261 --> 39:07.671
Emma Tonkin.

39:09.223 --> 39:11.054
My sister?
Yeah.

39:11.183 --> 39:14.300
And her two kids.
Your nephews.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.347
Just waiting
to come through.

39:16.438 --> 39:17.769
No.

39:17.898 --> 39:19.729
No, they died in
the Squamish massacre.

39:19.816 --> 39:21.397
No, they survived.

39:21.568 --> 39:22.557
All of them.

39:23.028 --> 39:26.737
But ifyou sabotage this,
they die for sure.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.820
Is that what you want?

39:34.706 --> 39:36.662
You let me handle
her my way.

39:45.801 --> 39:47.837
I thought
I'd been clear.

39:48.011 --> 39:49.592
"Clear" isn't exactly
the word lwould use.

39:49.680 --> 39:52.797
Did you really think
I wouldn't find out
you've been tracking me?

39:53.100 --> 39:55.807
I was trying to
keep you safe.
By protecting them?

39:56.186 --> 39:57.892
Maybe you've been
playing me since we met.

39:58.105 --> 39:59.311
What we have
was never false.

39:59.565 --> 40:01.556
Had. Past tense.

40:06.530 --> 40:08.566
The ground
keeps shifting.

40:08.824 --> 40:10.689
Maybe we don't want
the same things anymore.

40:10.784 --> 40:12.820
Maybe you should
just kill me.

40:14.162 --> 40:15.663
Isn't that what you
came here to do?

40:15.747 --> 40:16.736
Look.

40:16.832 --> 40:19.744
I swear, Kiera,
what is happening
is not dangerous.

40:19.835 --> 40:22.577
You need to walk away
and let us do what
we have to do.

40:22.671 --> 40:23.911
I can't.

40:25.007 --> 40:27.840
You hold the key to me
getting what I want.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.300
(GUN COCKING)
CARLOS: Put the gun down.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.307
That's not gonna happen.

40:34.391 --> 40:36.973
You came here
to kill her.
Now put it down.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.846
It's not that
simple, Carlos.

40:40.355 --> 40:42.311
He murdered
the other you.

40:42.399 --> 40:44.105
He's not your ally.
Open your eyes.

40:44.484 --> 40:48.068
Kiera, after everything
we've been through,
I need you to hear me.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.695
You get him out of here,
or he ends up like Lucas.

40:54.703 --> 40:57.194
I am sorry
I didn't tell you.

40:59.708 --> 41:01.289
I already knew.
Now get the hell
out of the way.

41:01.376 --> 41:05.745
It was something I wanted
so badly, I thought
I couldn't tell you.

41:11.928 --> 41:13.668
Maybe I can't trust him,

41:14.890 --> 41:16.426
but I need him.

41:22.397 --> 41:23.853
(RADlO CHATTER)

41:26.443 --> 41:27.899
KIERA: Figure that out.

41:29.071 --> 41:31.483
I didn't wanna
tell him where you were,
but he forced my hand.

41:31.573 --> 41:34.235
Alec, it's okay.
No more deception.

41:35.452 --> 41:37.113
Tell him what we know.

41:37.579 --> 41:39.570
Well, it's gonna be
news to you, too.

41:41.291 --> 41:43.907
Jason found the missing
piece of the puzzle.

41:44.044 --> 41:45.750
Everything's Changed.

41:46.588 --> 41:49.546
The energy patterns here?
They're not explosive.

41:49.633 --> 41:51.123
They're implosive.

41:51.301 --> 41:54.919
The device is literally
punching a hole in the
space-time continuum.

41:55.097 --> 41:56.507
And what is that?

41:57.182 --> 41:58.718
That's a tethered wormhole.

42:00.018 --> 42:01.599
Uh, you wanna try
explaining that to me

42:01.687 --> 42:03.803
like I don't have
a degree in physics?

42:03.897 --> 42:05.558
Sure.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

42:05.774 --> 42:09.767
It's like an elevator,
but instead of going up and
down, it moves through time.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.522
A time elevator?
(CHUCKLES)

42:11.613 --> 42:14.605
A portal through time
between now and the future.

42:15.575 --> 42:18.112
The energy provides
a stable, limited connection.

42:18.203 --> 42:20.819
That's why they needed
to build it in that
exact location.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.697
The two sides need
to be exactly the same
in both time periods

42:23.792 --> 42:25.123
or else it's not
gonna work.

42:25.794 --> 42:28.831
They are very likely bringing
people back from their future.

42:29.339 --> 42:32.251
The supplies
they've stolen?
Blood? Medicine?

42:32.342 --> 42:34.458
Those are the kinds of
things an army needs.

42:34.553 --> 42:36.509
Yeah, for an invasion.

42:37.264 --> 42:38.800
We have to stop it.

42:39.725 --> 42:41.306
Yeah, of course we do.

42:41.727 --> 42:44.764
But there's also
a very tiny silver lining
to this dark cloud.

42:45.647 --> 42:48.764
That's a temporal matrix
running within a cortex.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.436
It's a two-way street.

42:51.027 --> 42:52.608
With the time ball
and their power source,

42:52.696 --> 42:55.062
it may be possible
to hybridize it
so you could...

42:55.198 --> 42:56.779
Travel forward.

43:00.370 --> 43:02.486
You asked me
to send you home.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.082
With this machine
complete,

43:07.419 --> 43:10.035
I'm almost certain
I can do exactly that.
