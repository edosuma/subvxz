ANNIE: Who?

12:55.640 --> 12:57.005
JAKE: You'll find out.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.844
Intimidating, isn't it?

13:12.320 --> 13:13.890
You have any idea the people who have

13:13.960 --> 13:17.009
walked on these boards before you?

13:17.680 --> 13:20.160
Geraldine Page. Helen Hayes.

13:20.520 --> 13:24.491
Jason Robards. Marlon Brando.
And now Riggan Thomson.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.804
(CHUCKLES) Thanks for coming
in on such short notice, Mike.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.491
This is what I do.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.164
You wrote this adaptation?

13:31.400 --> 13:32.561
- I did, yeah.
- Ah.

13:32.800 --> 13:36.009
And you're directing and starring.
That's ambitious.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.321
Well, thanks.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.007
Well, it's a good theater.

13:40.640 --> 13:44.167
I can't speak for your play, but...
let's do a little bit of it.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.562
RIGGAN: Oh, I didn't expect
you to just jump right in.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.320
It's first preview tomorrow night.
Let's get to work.

13:49.560 --> 13:53.406
Well, feel free to take the script
up until you feel comfortable.

13:53.680 --> 13:56.160
No, let's just do some of it.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.521
Uh...

13:58.600 --> 13:59.931
Take a look at page 20.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.685
I'm good. I don't need it.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.126
I don't need the script.
Give me a cue.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.361
What?

14:04.600 --> 14:06.284
- Feed me a line.
- (STAMMERING)

14:06.520 --> 14:07.681
Feed me a line.

14:07.760 --> 14:08.841
Okay.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.362
Okay, uh, let me think.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.524
I'm the wrong person to ask.
I didn't actually know him.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.961
- I only heard his name mentioned in passing.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.644
You'd have to know
the particulars.

14:20.760 --> 14:24.048
But I think what you're
saying is love is absolute.

14:24.880 --> 14:28.282
Is that what I'm saying? Am I saying
love is absolute? (INHALES SHARPLY)

14:28.360 --> 14:30.203
Yes. Okay, yeah!
The kind of love

14:30.280 --> 14:31.884
I'm talking about is absolute.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.886
The kind of love I'm talking about,
you don't try to kill people!

14:36.120 --> 14:37.804
How do you know the lines?

14:38.360 --> 14:40.508
It's a thing I have.
I don't know, it's a gift.

14:40.534 --> 14:41.070
Wow.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.404
Come on. I've been helping
Lesley get off book for a month.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.041
- These lines are right here.
- That makes sense.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.970
That's good.
Give me my cue again.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.720
I'm the wrong person to ask.
I didn't actually know him.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.725
I only heard his name
mentioned in passing.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.406
You never know the particulars.
I think what--

14:58.640 --> 15:00.483
Can I make a suggestion?

15:00.560 --> 15:02.244
- Do you mind?
- No, not at all.

15:02.560 --> 15:06.087
No, no, forget that.
Just stay with me.

15:06.400 --> 15:10.086
"I'm the wrong person to ask,"
he says, but what's the intention?

15:10.320 --> 15:12.243
Is he fed up with the subject?

15:12.320 --> 15:14.004
Deflecting guilt over the marriage?

15:14.240 --> 15:16.447
And here's the thing--
you have four lines after that

15:16.560 --> 15:19.245
that all say the same thing.
"I didn't know him."

15:19.600 --> 15:21.807
"I only heard his name
mentioned in passing."

15:21.880 --> 15:23.086
"I wouldn't know."

15:23.320 --> 15:24.765
"You'd have to know
the particulars."

15:24.840 --> 15:27.002
"Particulars" sounds like my grandmother.

15:27.280 --> 15:30.921
The point is, you don't know the guy.
We fucking get it.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.611
Make it work with one line.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.762
"I didn't even know the man." Right?

15:35.120 --> 15:37.930
Wait-- You know my lines, too, huh?

15:38.280 --> 15:40.442
Can we not get hung up on knowing lines?

15:40.520 --> 15:42.602
Can we just work on this?
Tear it apart?

15:42.840 --> 15:45.127
So why don't you just give
me that same thing again,

15:45.200 --> 15:47.362
- but cut it down. Try it.
- Uh...

15:47.600 --> 15:48.965
I'm the wrong person to ask--

15:49.200 --> 15:52.124
Oh, no! That's the thing--
"I'm the wrong person to ask."

15:52.200 --> 15:53.201
I think it's, "Fuck you."

15:53.440 --> 15:55.807
"Fuck you. Don't put me on the spot."

15:56.040 --> 15:58.805
"Don't make me feel
self-conscious about my marriage"

15:58.880 --> 16:00.882
"while my wife is sitting..."

16:01.120 --> 16:02.804
- Right there.
- "...right there."

16:03.120 --> 16:05.487
- Can I sit down for this?
- Yeah, sit. Good idea.

16:05.800 --> 16:09.327
So just give it to me
as a "Fuck you." Lay it on me.

16:09.640 --> 16:10.971
Just do it. Give it to me.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.561
- Well, I'm thinking.
- Fuck me hard. Just give it.

16:13.800 --> 16:14.801
Come on! Just do it!

16:15.040 --> 16:17.088
Hey, I'm the wrong
person to ask!

16:17.160 --> 16:19.083
I don't even know him.
What's your point?!

16:19.320 --> 16:21.288
- What's my point?
- Yeah, what are you saying?

16:21.360 --> 16:22.486
- Spit it out!
- Oh! Oh!

16:22.720 --> 16:25.803
You're saying what?
You're saying love is absolute.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.570
Yes! Yes!

16:27.640 --> 16:30.769
The kind of love that I'm
talking about, it is absolute!

16:31.000 --> 16:32.570
(VOICE BREAKING)
The kind of love that I'm talking about,

16:32.640 --> 16:33.846
you don't...

16:35.000 --> 16:37.321
...you don't try to kill people.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.171
Yeah. Good.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.045
I don't know--
what do you think, boss?

16:44.120 --> 16:46.691
You want to do this with me?

16:47.160 --> 16:48.525
What do you think?

16:48.760 --> 16:51.445
Everybody's back.
Larry needs to see him for a fitting.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.286
I'll take that as a yes.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.365
So, who are you?

16:58.600 --> 17:00.921
- That's Sam, my daughter.
- Oh.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.691
Wow! That's amazing.
You don't look anything like each other.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.046
What do you do?

17:05.359 --> 17:07.521
- Um...
- She's my assistant. Works with me.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.525
And does she talk and speak?

17:10.880 --> 17:12.290
She does. Yeah.

17:12.359 --> 17:15.887
She can even sit or stay or roll
over, if you have any treats.

17:16.359 --> 17:17.724
Welcome aboard, Mike!

17:17.800 --> 17:19.040
Thank you, Captain.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.731
Um, I'm Mike...Shiner.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.290
Oh, I know who you are.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.928
I, uh, saw you in <i>Hothouse</i>
at the Geffen.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.047
You were great.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.771
Oh, thank you.
Your ass is great.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.721
Dude. Seriously?

17:35.720 --> 17:37.165
MIKE: That was just me--

17:37.400 --> 17:39.402
Larry? Larry?

17:39.880 --> 17:41.086
This is the theater, sweetheart.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.400
Don't be so self-conscious.

17:42.640 --> 17:43.721
He's here.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.241
Thank the Lord and pass the biscuits.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.321
I finally have an actor to dress.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.607
How are you, Larry?

17:48.680 --> 17:50.921
Better now you're here.
Take off your clothes.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.331
You're just going to stand there?

17:55.560 --> 17:58.086
This is the theater, honey.
Don't be so self-conscious.

17:58.320 --> 18:02.325
We have to start from scratch
with less than 24 hours.

18:02.600 --> 18:03.931
Here. Try these--

18:04.240 --> 18:06.607
Holy shi--!
Where are your underpants?

18:06.840 --> 18:09.002
Under the bed at home, I think.

18:09.160 --> 18:10.161
Uh...

18:10.760 --> 18:13.923
No. Okay, okay.
Everything's too small.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.611
- You're not kidding.
- Oh.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.490
LESLEY: Whoa. That's nice.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.927
Forgive him, Larry.
Mike's like my 5-year-old son.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.531
Neither of them has clean underwear.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.127
Or pubic hair, I imagine.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.680
I can alter the suit,

18:25.760 --> 18:28.081
but we're going to have to make
new trousers and shirts.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.446
And underwear.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.443
- What are you doing?
- Waiting on Larry.

18:32.680 --> 18:33.806
LARRY: I'm finished!

18:34.040 --> 18:36.361
Then I'm just standing
here with my cock out.

18:36.600 --> 18:37.601
Well, get dressed.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.291
Riggan's daughter is hanging around--
she might walk in here.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.766
You haven't seen her.

18:41.840 --> 18:45.640
She's always around, watching
everyone, like Little Miss Creepy.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.486
I don't know if drugs fried
her brain or what...

18:48.720 --> 18:50.882
but I don't want her
running to her father

18:50.960 --> 18:52.041
saying you showed her your junk.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.328
Then we should ask her to leave.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.810
- Oh, God. Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.484
- Sammy?
- SAM: It's Sam.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.722
Sam...Lesley.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.651
Listen, um, what I said--

19:02.880 --> 19:05.884
Oh, don't worry about it.
He's a handful, huh?

19:08.320 --> 19:11.403
How do you always manage to find
a new way to humiliate me?

19:11.640 --> 19:13.563
Oh, to be fair, you
make it really easy.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.171
What was she doing here?

19:15.400 --> 19:17.084
- She brought me down.
- And stayed?

19:17.320 --> 19:19.641
Well, she is a little...
something.

19:19.920 --> 19:22.844
This is Broadway.
And I'm here, finally.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.481
Now, please, do me a favor,
I'm begging you--

19:25.600 --> 19:26.761
don't fuck it up!

19:27.080 --> 19:28.241
Lesley.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.729
Come here. Come here.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.006
(SIGHS)

19:34.600 --> 19:36.443
(WHISPERING)
Play with my balls.

19:36.880 --> 19:39.087
- (GROANS) Don't do it. Ow!
- (LESLEY GRUNTING)

19:39.440 --> 19:40.441
RIGGAN: Just sign it.

19:40.600 --> 19:41.681
- JAKE: Listen...
- No, you listen to me!

19:41.920 --> 19:42.921
I can't afford to listen to you.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.411
LARRY: I have to go shopping again.

19:44.480 --> 19:45.766
Just sew something, you old fuck!

19:46.000 --> 19:47.365
Give him whatever he wants!

19:47.440 --> 19:48.680
It's four times what we paid
what's-his-name!

19:48.920 --> 19:50.251
Go into the reserve.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.766
It's gone! We spent it
on fog and fake trees...

19:53.040 --> 19:54.041
It's a dream sequence.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.645
And dancing midgets!

19:55.720 --> 19:57.131
You can't say "midget" anymore.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.691
The reserve is gone!

20:02.280 --> 20:04.282
You didn't see what I just saw.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.722
I'm telling you, this
guy's the real deal.

20:06.800 --> 20:07.961
I can feel it.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.889
He's the actor we've been waiting for.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.928
Come on. Just get the contract done.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.480
Please, Jake.
I'll get the money.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.970
Okay, I'll do it.

20:18.040 --> 20:20.202
Stop smiling.
You're freaking me out.

20:20.480 --> 20:21.811
Sorry. You're right.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.050
Is it true? Shiner?

20:25.320 --> 20:26.560
Holy shit. When can I meet him?

20:26.640 --> 20:27.801
He's with Larry now.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.923
I'm going to Starbucks.
Want anything?

20:30.040 --> 20:31.087
I'm good.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.800
She has a great ass.
I have news for you, too.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.162
Is it good or bad?
'Cause I really--

20:36.400 --> 20:38.402
I missed my last two periods.
(EXHALES)

20:39.320 --> 20:41.163
I think it's really happening.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.006
- (SIGHS)
- Wow.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.243
Is that good or bad? Riggan!

20:45.320 --> 20:47.163
It's good. It's great.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.323
- Say something else.
- Um...

20:51.000 --> 20:52.001
Uh...

20:52.080 --> 20:53.764
You sure it's mine?
(CHUCKLES)

20:54.160 --> 20:55.685
Well, you know, there's you,

20:55.760 --> 20:57.683
there's Jake, the masseur wore a condom...

20:57.920 --> 20:59.843
yeah, I'm pretty sure it's yours.
(CHUCKLES)

21:00.160 --> 21:01.366
Idiot.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.207
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.531
Me, too.

21:12.680 --> 21:14.523
You're not funny!

21:17.520 --> 21:19.887
What? Hey, what?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.968
(WOMAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

21:36.200 --> 21:38.407
First preview tomorrow.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.884
Here we go.

21:45.400 --> 21:48.244
MIKE: I rode with him
in the ambulance to the hospital.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.324
LESLEY: I will never get
that image out of my head.

21:51.560 --> 21:55.406
Right before he did it, his eyes
were so sad and lonely.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.324
LAURA: Did you have to treat him?

21:57.400 --> 21:59.004
MIKE: I didn't have to, but I did.

21:59.240 --> 22:02.562
ANNIE: Music out.
Cue 34, 35 ready.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.251
MIKE: He was in terrible shape.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.766
His head swelled to twice
the size of a normal head.

22:07.080 --> 22:09.082
- He's good, huh?
- He's incredible.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.243
I think he's drinking real gin.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.601
What?

22:13.600 --> 22:17.605
Ask Nick. I want you to ask
Nick if he thinks that's love.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.525
LESLEY: Oh, honey, can't

You don't know how he's been lately.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.162
He's been depressed.
I've been worried.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.771
You've been what?

22:29.920 --> 22:34.130
Let me tell you guys something about real
love. I'll tell you something.

what we're talking about...

Oh, for God's sake,
are you getting drunk?

22:42.760 --> 22:44.364
I don't have to be drunk
to say what I think.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.670
We're not drunk.
We're having a few drinks.

22:46.676 --> 22:47.351
Exactly.

Leave her alone. If you're not
drunk, don't talk like you are.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.805
...you want to know about real love,
there's this old couple...

23:09.960 --> 23:12.327
...had a car wreck,
out on the interstate.

23:13.480 --> 23:17.644

his old man's pickup...

23:18.320 --> 23:20.004
...right into their camper.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.960
By the time I got
down to the hospital, this kid,

23:23.040 --> 23:25.486
this fucking teenager, was dead.

23:26.640 --> 23:29.166
So we took the old couple up to the O.R.

23:29.480 --> 23:32.324
We worked like hell on them
through most of the night.

23:34.000 --> 23:38.005
By the time we were done
with them, we just, you know...

23:38.320 --> 23:41.688
...wrapped them in full body casts.

23:43.680 --> 23:46.001
The husband, the old man...

23:47.160 --> 23:49.527
...was depressed for the longest time.

23:49.760 --> 23:51.285
Even after I said to him,

23:51.360 --> 23:54.762
"Your wife's going to pull through",
he was still depressed.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.121

23:56.200 --> 24:00.524
So, I went up to the mouth
hole and I asked him.

24:02.200 --> 24:06.364
And he told me it
was because he couldn't see her...

24:07.040 --> 24:10.203
...through the eyes.
Couldn't see his wife.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.884
Can you imagine?

24:13.120 --> 24:16.841
I'm telling you, this guy's heart
was breaking because...

24:27.640 --> 24:29.324
I am so tired of this.
Is this water?

24:29.640 --> 24:30.880
It was killing him.
