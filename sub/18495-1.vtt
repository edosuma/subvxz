03:04.701 --> 03:07.705
Henry!

03:09.873 --> 03:13.276
Hen...

03:17.255 --> 03:19.678
Henry? Henry!

03:19.841 --> 03:22.685
Henry, what is it? Darling, wake up!

03:22.844 --> 03:25.472
Darling, what's the matter?

03:32.395 --> 03:35.899
- I'm fine.
- Darling, are you all right?

03:36.900 --> 03:39.028
Yes. Yes, I...

03:41.613 --> 03:44.457
I'm sorry to have woken you.

03:44.616 --> 03:47.244
- I'm fine.
- Henry?

03:52.541 --> 03:55.590
I'm fine. Go back... to sleep.

05:47.530 --> 05:49.532
Good morning, sir.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.131
Thank you, sir.

06:06.925 --> 06:11.522
- Good morning, Dr. Jekyll.
- Good morning, Mr. Stanton.

06:15.141 --> 06:16.751
Straight to the hospital, sir?

06:16.851 --> 06:20.064
- As usual.
- Very good, sir.

06:20.230 --> 06:22.232
Gee-up.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.769
You don't want to use morphine, as well?

06:55.932 --> 06:57.900
No need.

07:11.156 --> 07:16.003
You're a lucky man.
This is a new anesthetic.

07:16.161 --> 07:20.837
Your eye's going to become numb.
You won't feel any pain.

08:17.639 --> 08:20.062
If his eye had moved at all,
you'd have blinded him.

08:20.225 --> 08:22.853
But it did not move, did it?

08:23.269 --> 08:25.672
I suppose it could replace morphine
as a local.

08:25.772 --> 08:28.446
This drug has application
far beyond anesthesia.

08:28.650 --> 08:30.448
I have such energy, such exhilaration,

08:30.610 --> 08:32.846
almost euphoria sometimes,
and without distortion.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.573
- It's quite amazing.
- You're actually using it on yourself?

08:35.740 --> 08:37.267
Of course, I'm preparing a full study.

08:37.366 --> 08:41.020
Egglestone's pushing for me to present
it at the Vienna conference next month.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.624
Well, that's in two weeks.
Do you think it'll be ready?

08:43.789 --> 08:45.900
It could change our entire
approach to medicine.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.610
And the dreams, Lanyon.
Incredible, vivid...

08:47.710 --> 08:52.181
No, not dreams. More like memories
or experiences of another level.

08:52.340 --> 08:56.244
Jekyll, are you sure it's... safe?

08:56.470 --> 08:58.938
Primitive people have been using it
for centuries.

08:59.097 --> 09:02.292
Until now, man has been locked up
in the dark prison of the mind.

09:02.392 --> 09:04.611
I may have discovered
the secret to set him free.

09:04.769 --> 09:08.631
Excuse me, Dr. Jekyll.
There's a young woman in reception.

09:08.731 --> 09:12.201
- She says your wife sent her.
- My wife?

09:12.735 --> 09:15.158
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
I'll be right there.

09:15.321 --> 09:17.770
A charity case. Come with me.

09:39.387 --> 09:43.142
- No cough? Shortage of breath?
- No.

09:43.308 --> 09:47.358
Uh, could I ask you
to remove your shirt, please?

09:49.147 --> 09:51.650
Good Lord.

09:51.816 --> 09:54.319
Look at this, Jekyll.

09:55.153 --> 09:57.180
How did this happen? Were you beaten?

09:57.280 --> 09:59.328
It was me brothers, sir.

09:59.490 --> 10:03.165
But I thought you came from
the shelter, that you had no home.

10:03.328 --> 10:07.398
That's right, sir, but they came
to visit me, me brothers, that is,

10:07.498 --> 10:10.193
and then they beat me.

10:10.293 --> 10:13.968
- This looks like a rope burn.
- Oh, that's right.

10:14.130 --> 10:16.883
Well, they tied me up first, and then...

10:21.221 --> 10:23.849
Do you live in a nice house?

10:25.433 --> 10:28.027
It's all right, I suppose.

10:29.395 --> 10:32.023
I'll leave this to you, Lanyon.

10:33.608 --> 10:36.953
She's from the East End of London.
Prostitute.

10:37.362 --> 10:39.114
Come on, dear, let's have a look at you.

10:46.371 --> 10:50.842
Oh, look at this, Charlie.
Look what I've got for you.

10:51.334 --> 10:53.336
Come on.

11:01.803 --> 11:03.805
Mmm. It's good, isn't it?

11:05.556 --> 11:08.355
Darling, come and see this.

11:11.229 --> 11:15.884
Oh, Henry.
You haven't touched your supper.

11:15.984 --> 11:18.887
You know, I ought to take this food
down to the poor at Bethnal Green

11:18.987 --> 11:20.330
and let you starve.

11:20.488 --> 11:23.992
- I'll be finished in 10 minutes.
- That's what you said four hours ago.

11:24.450 --> 11:28.000
- I'm working on a new solution.
- At least, have a cup of tea.

11:28.162 --> 11:29.539
Watch.

11:30.248 --> 11:32.546
Oh, look at him eat that up.

11:35.670 --> 11:38.139
Good night, Dr. Jekyll.

11:40.049 --> 11:42.772
Pss, pss, pss, pss! Charlie!

12:17.670 --> 12:19.638
Charlie, what have you done?

13:50.096 --> 13:52.474
Henry?

13:54.100 --> 13:56.102
Henry?

14:02.233 --> 14:04.736
Henry?

14:07.238 --> 14:09.240
Come on, giddy up.

14:09.407 --> 14:13.002
Not too far now. Two streets ahead.

14:13.161 --> 14:16.356
Hope I didn't make a fool of myself.

14:16.456 --> 14:19.551
Don't be silly. It was very amusing, dear.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.525
Hello, love.
Looking for a naughty girl, then?

15:00.625 --> 15:03.845
What's your hurry, darling?

15:04.045 --> 15:06.798
Hello, sir. If you're looking
for a place to enjoy yourself,

15:06.964 --> 15:09.700
all you need is some
of that lovely stuff, money...

15:09.800 --> 15:11.702
You, sir, should be having a good time.

15:11.802 --> 15:15.682
But I am. I'm having a marvelous time.

15:18.017 --> 15:21.738
Ah, but, sir, you're not getting my drift.
I mean a real special time.

15:21.896 --> 15:25.049
- You can't do that alone, can you?
- I'm not alone, am I?

15:25.149 --> 15:28.244
Ah, they're all stupid peasants.
I wouldn't give a toss for them.

15:28.569 --> 15:31.948
Now, a gent like you should be having
a good time at Madam Flora's.

15:32.114 --> 15:34.267
That's why you're here.
Ain't I right, sir?

15:34.367 --> 15:35.869
Perhaps.

15:37.453 --> 15:40.002
You, uh, come this way, sir.

15:40.456 --> 15:42.834
I'm sure you must have heard
of Madam Flora's, sir.

15:43.042 --> 15:45.716
- I don't believe so.
- Lots of gentlemen come here, sir.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.113
It's quite famous.

15:47.213 --> 15:50.808
She has something to suit all tastes,
if you get my meaning.

15:51.300 --> 15:54.429
In here, sir. This way.

15:54.595 --> 15:56.597
Spare a copper, guvna.

16:06.857 --> 16:13.160
- So this is Madam Flora's?
- Well, sir, there you're quite right.

16:13.322 --> 16:15.370
This is Madam Flora.

16:20.329 --> 16:25.836
Hello, Johnny. I see you've brought us
a nice new gentleman for this evening.

16:26.043 --> 16:30.890
I bid you welcome, sir.
First time here, right?

16:32.550 --> 16:34.769
You can call me Flora.

16:37.763 --> 16:41.859
- And you're?
- Hyde. Jack Hyde.

16:42.852 --> 16:45.087
Johnny, show Mr. Hyde our selection.

16:45.187 --> 16:48.407
I'm sure we can find something
to tickle his fancy.

16:48.649 --> 16:50.242
Come on, sir. Come on.

17:16.385 --> 17:19.810
Uh, Mr. Hyde!
Hey, come on! What'll it be, eh?

17:19.972 --> 17:24.227
- Just a minute, sir. Just a minute.
- Mr. Hyde! Mr. Hyde!

17:42.745 --> 17:44.747
Get away!

18:05.226 --> 18:07.228
No!

18:26.706 --> 18:28.629
You bastard!

18:37.341 --> 18:40.766
Hello, handsome. Looking for someone?

18:42.972 --> 18:46.476
- Yes.
- Well, maybe you've found her.

18:47.935 --> 18:50.529
Ooh. Oh, yeah.

18:50.688 --> 18:53.541
I'll satisfy that smile of yours. Come on.

18:53.707 --> 18:54.608
Where?

18:54.775 --> 18:58.450
I got me own place. It's more private.

18:59.029 --> 19:02.329
- Let's go.
- You're in for a high time of it.

19:02.491 --> 19:07.338
Just keep smiling. It's not far.
Just along the street a bit.

19:14.128 --> 19:15.630
Got your own brew, eh?

19:16.046 --> 19:19.346
I had a sailor once.
Brought me some opium.

19:19.508 --> 19:22.603
That was nice. Dreamy, like.

19:22.970 --> 19:26.019
Helped cover up his ol' smell, too.

19:27.558 --> 19:29.443
A Turk.

19:30.394 --> 19:32.396
Well, come on, then.

19:54.001 --> 19:56.754
Gonna stand there all night?

20:00.257 --> 20:02.680
- What?
- Come on.

20:04.011 --> 20:06.355
Take your pleasure, sir.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.358
Hey! That's my good china!

20:13.270 --> 20:14.396
Shut up!

20:40.506 --> 20:43.385
Oh, God.

20:46.095 --> 20:50.771
Look at that. Look at that!

20:50.933 --> 20:53.607
Sure. Take a good look.

20:54.603 --> 20:56.480
Ooh.

20:56.647 --> 20:58.649
Ah!

20:59.608 --> 21:01.736
Got a bit of the Turk in you, too, eh?

21:14.248 --> 21:17.673
Well? You wanna look, do you?

21:25.384 --> 21:28.433
Look at it all. Look.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.897
- You'll like it.
- Yes.

21:34.059 --> 21:36.482
- You will.
- Yes.

21:36.645 --> 21:39.694
Come on. It likes you, see.

21:41.817 --> 21:45.993
- I can't.
- Oh, sure, you can.

21:46.155 --> 21:49.500
- Why not?
- Because I'm ba...

21:49.658 --> 21:52.036
Because I'm bad.

21:52.870 --> 21:54.872
Ooh!

21:57.374 --> 21:59.797
You are, are you?

22:01.879 --> 22:04.974
You don't seem
like such a bad fella to me.

22:06.967 --> 22:10.597
- Why'd ya say that now?
- You know.

22:10.763 --> 22:13.141
No. Why?

22:13.307 --> 22:16.436
- You know!
- No. What?

22:16.602 --> 22:18.855
Liar! You know, you slut!

22:19.021 --> 22:21.274
- Stop it!
- You see? I told you!

22:21.482 --> 22:24.782
I told you I was bad!

22:27.279 --> 22:29.748
Make me pray.

22:31.742 --> 22:33.769
- Make me pray!
- Yes, all right!

22:33.869 --> 22:38.215
Make me Pray!

22:39.708 --> 22:44.134
Holy Father, in heaven are You
and in heaven shall be all Thy children.

22:45.130 --> 22:48.600
Holy Father, bless me. Holy Father, Lo...

22:51.261 --> 22:53.480
Love me.

22:53.931 --> 22:57.526
Do you... love me?

22:58.435 --> 23:00.529
Yeah. Yeah.

23:00.688 --> 23:03.567
- Say it.
- I love you. I love you.

23:03.732 --> 23:07.157
- Say it again.
- I love you. I love you.

23:07.319 --> 23:10.698
- Forever?
- Yeah. Forever.

23:12.700 --> 23:15.670
You're a good girl, a very good girl.

23:16.912 --> 23:22.043
- Hope I haven't frightened you.
- That's all right. You just got excited.

23:22.209 --> 23:24.751
You don't really think I'm bad, do you?

23:24.920 --> 23:26.572
No.

23:27.089 --> 23:29.308
You're just having your pleasure.

23:29.508 --> 23:31.510
Do you still love me?

23:32.803 --> 23:35.431
Yeah. Of course I do.

23:36.724 --> 23:38.226
Liar.

23:56.535 --> 23:58.537
Good morning.

24:00.622 --> 24:03.216
Henry, time to get up.

24:04.918 --> 24:07.171
Come on, wake up.

24:10.841 --> 24:12.684
It's late.

24:13.052 --> 24:18.434
Just because you work all night
does not mean you can sleep all day.

24:21.435 --> 24:24.689
Oh! Elisabeth, please.

24:27.191 --> 24:31.265
Doctor? Doctor?

24:31.820 --> 24:35.700
I have an emergency.
My heart is missing. I can't find it.

24:35.866 --> 24:39.211
- Oh, no.
- Doctor.

24:39.369 --> 24:43.749
Will you help me look for it, please?

24:45.250 --> 24:48.220
Oh, God.

24:51.882 --> 24:55.978
Oh, yes, I remember where I lost it.

25:05.020 --> 25:07.239
Hmm.

25:07.397 --> 25:09.775
Well, I think you're awake.

25:10.234 --> 25:14.580
Come on, now. They'll be here soon.
Our picnic, remember?

25:17.908 --> 25:20.787
No, no, not today. I can't.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.813
What do you mean, you can't? You must.

25:22.913 --> 25:26.108
No. I must rest. I...

25:26.208 --> 25:28.711
It's out of the question.

25:28.877 --> 25:32.756
Henry, they're your friends.
You invited them.

25:32.915 --> 25:35.217
I'm busy, too, but I have
no choice, have I?

25:35.384 --> 25:39.139
My work isn't important enough
to allow me to be rude.

25:41.098 --> 25:42.124
Madam.

25:42.224 --> 25:46.274
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Underwood
is waiting in your office.

25:50.732 --> 25:53.611
Gabriel, you've been
my lawyer for 20 years.

25:53.777 --> 25:55.929
You know me better than any man alive.

25:56.029 --> 25:57.890
That's probably true.

25:57.990 --> 26:02.019
And yet I feel that sometimes
I don't even know myself.

26:02.119 --> 26:04.918
Henry, what's the matter?

26:05.122 --> 26:09.218
Suppose you found yourself
at the edge of a labyrinth,

26:10.002 --> 26:13.051
or, better still, a dark forest.

26:14.256 --> 26:17.284
And you believed there was
a great secret hidden inside,

26:17.384 --> 26:19.386
perhaps a wonderful secret.

26:19.636 --> 26:24.563
But there was a danger
that even if you discovered it,

26:25.517 --> 26:30.023
you might get lost
and never find your way out again.

26:31.023 --> 26:35.028
Would you go forward into the forest?

26:36.778 --> 26:41.909
It would just depend how worthwhile,
how valuable the prospect was,

26:42.075 --> 26:43.793
how great the risk.

26:45.245 --> 26:48.124
How can I help you?

26:48.540 --> 26:51.794
I don't know yet.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.088
But I will need your help.

26:56.131 --> 26:58.133
And soon.

27:00.052 --> 27:03.306
Show Inspector Newcomen
the body, will you?

27:03.764 --> 27:06.375
I see it says the throat was cut across

27:06.475 --> 27:09.775
to the extent of about six
or seven inches.

27:10.312 --> 27:12.506
Bloody barbarian.

27:12.606 --> 27:15.008
Must think he's making
cucumber sandwiches,

27:15.108 --> 27:17.907
everything's so precise and neat.

27:18.987 --> 27:23.016
- You sure he slit her throat first?
- Well, it's obvious, isn't it? He had to.

27:23.116 --> 27:25.539
Or the other cuts wouldn't be so clean.

27:25.744 --> 27:28.964
No struggling. Sick animal.

27:29.122 --> 27:31.875
- No hacking at all.
- Hacking? No.

27:32.042 --> 27:35.387
Three clean rips, I would say.

27:35.545 --> 27:41.518
He must have had the eye of an eagle
and a hand steady as steel.

27:41.718 --> 27:45.814
He ripped from down there
and opened her up to here.

27:45.973 --> 27:50.399
Rip! Clean as a codfish
from Billingsgate market.

27:50.560 --> 27:55.111
More than good eyes and nerves.
Obviously had a good brain, too.

27:55.732 --> 27:57.734
Someone who knows anatomy, right?

27:57.901 --> 28:01.201
Oh, makes Mickey there
look like a butcher's assistant.

28:15.419 --> 28:18.263
Whoa! Whoa!

28:18.422 --> 28:21.722
Thank you, Mrs. Jekyll,
for such a lovely day.

28:22.175 --> 28:23.927
It was fun, wasn't it?

28:25.137 --> 28:27.560
We must do it again.

28:28.890 --> 28:31.439
When I finish.

28:36.940 --> 28:39.238
Henry.

28:39.401 --> 28:44.498
I'm sorry I was so cross this morning.
I do know how important your work is.

28:45.198 --> 28:47.200
Thank you.

29:01.006 --> 29:04.601
You've never been
anything else but brilliant,

29:05.093 --> 29:10.441
but this discovery ought to be
the most significant milestone,

29:10.599 --> 29:14.149
not only for you but for the whole
of the British medical profession.

29:14.353 --> 29:18.199
It is vital that you announce it
at the Vienna conference.

29:18.357 --> 29:19.899
Yes, well...

29:21.276 --> 29:23.153
It will be ready.

29:23.320 --> 29:28.497
Of course, if they do send me off
to take over this job in Calcutta,

29:28.658 --> 29:34.631
there will be a vacancy on the board
of governors at the hospital here.

29:36.416 --> 29:41.217
Well, it would, of course,
mean extra responsibility,

29:41.380 --> 29:44.304
but it could also mean
the crowning glory of your career.

29:44.466 --> 29:46.660
Yes, yes, I know.

29:46.760 --> 29:49.354
Bollingham!

29:49.513 --> 29:52.483
Disease will be the least
of your problems then.

29:52.641 --> 29:55.485
Bollingham, good to see you relaxing.

29:55.644 --> 30:00.366
Once a week, Egglestone,
as regular as clockwork.

30:01.108 --> 30:05.079
- Oh, hello, Jekyll.
- Hello, sir. Good to see you again.

30:05.237 --> 30:08.707
Jekyll has come up with
the most amazing new anesthesia.

30:08.907 --> 30:11.330
The whole study's being presented
in Vienna next week.

30:11.493 --> 30:13.645
Really will be a feather in our cap.

30:13.745 --> 30:16.498
Really? I'd like to come by
and have a look.

30:16.665 --> 30:19.026
- There may be some side effects.
- Aah, nonsense.

30:19.126 --> 30:20.002
Yes, of course.

30:20.168 --> 30:24.639
I must be getting back to my work.
Good to see you again, sir.

30:26.925 --> 30:31.852
You see, we've been having
the most remarkable...

30:45.527 --> 30:49.282
If we take the Tuesday noon boat train,

30:49.448 --> 30:52.247
we could be at Lillian's
by noon Wednesday.

30:56.037 --> 30:59.107
Would it be better to arrive in Vienna
Saturday night or Sunday morning,

30:59.207 --> 31:01.551
do you think?

31:11.219 --> 31:13.221
Henry?

31:14.097 --> 31:16.475
Yes, that will be fine.

31:16.725 --> 31:18.523
Henry?

31:24.357 --> 31:26.405
Henry.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.002
Henry?

31:47.380 --> 31:49.382
What is it? What do you want?

31:49.549 --> 31:52.018
I just wanted to say good night.

31:52.636 --> 31:54.638
Good night.

31:55.972 --> 31:57.940
Good night, Charlie.

32:40.809 --> 32:43.358
How about us getting together?

32:48.483 --> 32:49.826
Too far away.

33:36.239 --> 33:39.459
You just wait here a minute, love.

33:42.329 --> 33:47.210
- Georgie, I need another room.
- Sorry, I'm closing up.

33:47.375 --> 33:50.754
Come on, Georgie. I've got a big spender.

33:50.920 --> 33:53.218
Please. Paid in advance.

33:53.715 --> 33:55.513
Maggie, why can't you quit work

33:55.675 --> 33:59.179
and go home at a decent hour,
like everybody else, hmm?

33:59.429 --> 34:03.104
This is why, stupid.
The same reason you don't.

34:07.771 --> 34:11.947
All right, go on, then.
Top floor. Number 18.

34:12.400 --> 34:17.998
Just don't be all bloody night. I've got
a wife and family at home, you know.

34:18.697 --> 34:21.702
Our lucky day.
He happened to have one available.

34:23.495 --> 34:28.170
Our... lucky day?

34:40.553 --> 34:42.897
That's a long climb.

34:43.056 --> 34:45.058
Let's see.

34:45.225 --> 34:47.443
Oh, 18.

34:50.355 --> 34:53.905
Here we are. Oh, cozy.

34:54.943 --> 34:57.137
Light the lamp, will you, love?

34:57.237 --> 34:59.911
Maybe we can warm this place up.

35:08.915 --> 35:10.917
Sir?

35:15.422 --> 35:17.682
Sir?

35:17.966 --> 35:20.515
Mister?

35:20.677 --> 35:23.601
Where'd you go?

35:27.308 --> 35:31.404
Come on, now.
You didn't pay for any games.

35:37.610 --> 35:39.032
Sir, are you up there?

35:41.823 --> 35:45.418
Come on, or else I'm going in a minute.

35:52.041 --> 35:56.797
Sir? It's too cold up there.
Come on in now, mister.

36:15.064 --> 36:16.190
Come out.

36:21.070 --> 36:24.119
Ooh, it's like the North Pole out here.

36:34.417 --> 36:38.593
- Your skin is so white.
- It'll be blue in a minute.

36:50.433 --> 36:51.730
He likes you.

36:55.897 --> 36:58.366
Where are you?

37:09.577 --> 37:11.875
Sit down.

37:20.380 --> 37:21.702
Ooh.

37:23.308 --> 37:25.931
- Look at those.
- Mmm.

37:27.178 --> 37:31.058
He likes them, too. He likes them, too.

37:44.571 --> 37:47.165
Lie back. Lie back.

37:58.251 --> 38:01.721
Lie back. Lie back. Yeah.

38:06.092 --> 38:10.188
Oh, yeah. He likes it, too.
He likes it, too.

38:11.723 --> 38:17.105
You do it. Come on. You do it, yeah.
You do it, yeah. That's right.

38:19.981 --> 38:20.903
Ooh.

38:21.941 --> 38:23.051
The guy watching you...

38:23.151 --> 38:26.513
And you, you rather like him,
too, don't you?

38:26.613 --> 38:28.160
Yes.

38:29.490 --> 38:31.492
But you like me more?

38:31.659 --> 38:33.661
Hmm.

38:37.665 --> 38:40.714
- You like me more?
- Yes.

38:42.462 --> 38:45.215
- You like me more?
- Yes, I do.

38:50.219 --> 38:52.972
Don't stop. Don't stop.

38:54.265 --> 38:56.859
That's right. Don't stop.

38:57.018 --> 38:59.771
Yes. Don't stop.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.531
Yes.

39:01.689 --> 39:03.236
Yes.

39:03.441 --> 39:04.818
Don't stop.

39:12.659 --> 39:15.208
Oh! Mmm.

39:17.413 --> 39:18.960
Oh.

39:20.875 --> 39:22.001
Bitch!

39:28.299 --> 39:30.301
Maggie?

39:31.052 --> 39:33.054
Maggie?

39:53.992 --> 39:58.088
God, I couldn't breathe.
I thought I was gonna die.

39:58.246 --> 40:01.420
Oh, you wouldn't wanna do that.

40:01.582 --> 40:05.678
Oh, God. This is going to be so horrible.

40:25.064 --> 40:27.066
Oh!

40:36.117 --> 40:38.119
Oh, Maggie!

40:46.044 --> 40:48.843
Nobody else was in the building,
on the roof, nothing?

40:49.005 --> 40:51.007
No, sir. One man in the next building

40:51.174 --> 40:54.599
said he thought he saw a woman
on the roof alone about one o'clock,

40:54.761 --> 40:58.856
but he didn't really notice anything out
of the ordinary, except she was there.

40:59.015 --> 41:02.460
And five minutes later,
the old man sees her neatly slit up

41:02.560 --> 41:04.813
and someone jumping off the roof.

41:04.979 --> 41:07.107
There's a panic started down there.

41:07.273 --> 41:10.677
All these injuries were performed
by a sharp instrument like a knife

41:10.777 --> 41:14.156
and from the left common carotid artery.

41:14.322 --> 41:18.372
The Home Secretary's going to issue
his statement this afternoon, sir.

41:18.576 --> 41:20.749
Yes, he sent it round.

41:20.912 --> 41:24.148
"Want the people of London
to rest assured that the Home Office

41:24.248 --> 41:26.109
is in control of the situation,

41:26.209 --> 41:31.340
already having several clues to the
murderer's identity and whereabouts."

41:32.048 --> 41:35.769
"I am sure that Scotland Yard will
have this insane criminal behind bars

41:35.927 --> 41:37.975
before he can murder again."

41:38.137 --> 41:40.515
Well, bully for the Home Secretary.

41:45.645 --> 41:49.195
I've made Henry promise we're going
to visit you at your new post in India.

41:49.357 --> 41:52.281
Provided they make
the whole trip by elephant.

41:54.362 --> 41:56.535
I imagine it's not so dangerous there now.

41:56.697 --> 42:00.201
It's got to be safer than the streets
of London these days.

42:00.409 --> 42:03.208
Now, now. There's no need
for you ladies to worry.

42:03.371 --> 42:05.840
But there is.
There's great need for worry.

42:05.998 --> 42:08.922
These poor women murdered
in the most barbarous fashion.

42:09.127 --> 42:12.631
Well, the police have doubled
their force all over the East End.

42:12.797 --> 42:16.367
Well, that didn't seem
to stop him the other night.

42:16.467 --> 42:20.222
I'm sure practically all of Calcutta
is like Whitechapel, Dr. Egglestone.

42:20.429 --> 42:23.228
You think that if conditions were altered,

42:23.391 --> 42:25.860
the inhabitants of Whitechapel
would be aware

42:26.018 --> 42:29.488
that civilization has
something better to offer?

42:29.689 --> 42:32.283
- Well, Reverend Fowler thinks so.
- Who is he?

42:32.483 --> 42:35.282
He's the reverend
at St. Michael's in Whitechapel.

42:35.444 --> 42:37.446
He's opened the church
as a refuge to the women.

42:37.655 --> 42:40.249
Prostitutes in the church?

42:40.408 --> 42:42.456
That's all very admirable, my dear,

42:42.660 --> 42:45.438
but they might want to be right back
on the streets

42:45.538 --> 42:47.165
the moment this ripper's caught.

42:47.331 --> 42:50.084
Exactly. Let them choose for themselves.

42:50.251 --> 42:52.253
But are they really capable of doing that?

42:52.420 --> 42:54.923
But what do we really know of freedom?

42:55.089 --> 42:57.717
By God, if real freedom were offered you,

42:57.884 --> 43:01.013
you'd run for cover,
you'd hide, you'd be terrified.

43:01.179 --> 43:03.682
But I thought I was free.

43:03.848 --> 43:06.101
I mean free to do whatever you pleased.

43:06.267 --> 43:08.520
What if I followed
my every instinct, completely?

43:08.686 --> 43:11.906
You mean absolutely no rules, no laws?

43:12.064 --> 43:14.692
No laws, no proprieties, no holds barred.

43:14.859 --> 43:17.954
I see a piece of food I want, I take it.

43:18.112 --> 43:19.614
Henry, please.

43:19.780 --> 43:22.158
I see a woman I want, I take her, as well.

43:22.366 --> 43:25.061
Hold on, Jekyll!

43:25.161 --> 43:27.271
You all act as if our manners,
our morality,

43:27.371 --> 43:29.044
were handed down to us by God.

43:29.207 --> 43:31.380
- But they are.
- No, madam, they're not.

43:31.542 --> 43:33.069
We made them up by mutual agreement.

43:33.169 --> 43:34.887
But what if I don't agree? What then?

43:35.046 --> 43:38.346
I clap you in irons
and throw you in prison straight off.

43:40.343 --> 43:43.017
You'll have to catch me first.

43:59.320 --> 44:01.322
Whoa!

44:07.453 --> 44:09.455
Gee-up! Come on!

44:19.966 --> 44:22.845
Thought you might like
some milk and brandy.

44:24.637 --> 44:27.060
I embarrassed you.

44:30.559 --> 44:34.689
You seem... different these days. Distant.

44:35.940 --> 44:41.197
- Perhaps you're working too hard.
- It's worth working hard.

44:41.362 --> 44:44.206
The other doctors seem to have time to...

44:44.365 --> 44:46.367
To...

44:47.451 --> 44:50.796
- You know how I worry about...
- Don't.

44:52.164 --> 44:55.318
Drink this. It'll make you sleep like a baby.

44:55.418 --> 44:58.046
Sleep? Dear God, I don't want to sleep.

45:00.589 --> 45:02.591
Henry.

45:03.592 --> 45:06.220
Do you really work at night?

45:06.387 --> 45:09.687
- Do I really work at night?
- I mean, where do you go?

45:10.016 --> 45:12.815
To gambling halls and opium dens.
Where would I go?

45:12.977 --> 45:14.979
- To the hospital!
- But why?

45:15.980 --> 45:19.234
I'm working with a very special patient.

45:19.400 --> 45:21.823
A man who can only visit me at night.

45:21.986 --> 45:24.865
He has a strange
sort of sleeping sickness,

45:25.031 --> 45:27.033
but I think I can help him.

45:27.575 --> 45:29.873
Why can't he come here to the laboratory?

45:30.077 --> 45:33.422
Elisabeth, I don't have
everything I need here!

45:33.581 --> 45:36.630
- Well, who is it?
- Who is it?

45:36.834 --> 45:38.945
Why do you want to know who it is?

45:39.045 --> 45:41.264
What earthly concern
is it of yours who it is?

45:41.881 --> 45:44.242
Are you going to conquer
the medical profession too?

45:44.342 --> 45:47.016
Are you opening your own hospital now?

45:47.511 --> 45:50.640
Henry, what's wrong with my asking?

45:52.391 --> 45:55.895
Nothing, my dear devoted wife.
Nothing. You should know.

45:56.062 --> 45:57.838
Yes.

45:57.938 --> 46:01.363
It's a Mr. Hyde, yes, a Mr. Jack Hyde.

46:01.525 --> 46:04.779
Why don't you see if you can find out
some more about him?

46:04.945 --> 46:07.306
Perhaps you could help him,
perhaps you could cure him.

46:07.406 --> 46:09.283
He desperately needs to be cured.

46:09.450 --> 46:13.500
I'm sorry. I know you're only doing
what you have to do.

46:13.662 --> 46:17.292
That's right. Oh, that's exactly right.

46:17.833 --> 46:22.885
- I do love you, you know.
- I know. I know.

46:23.464 --> 46:25.466
So, please...

46:26.759 --> 46:29.262
...try not to distract me now.

47:21.689 --> 47:24.112
Hello, Mr. Hyde.

47:25.234 --> 47:28.989
Hello, sir. I'm Susannah.

47:29.155 --> 47:34.457
You look ever so familiar.
Haven't we been together before?

47:35.077 --> 47:39.583
Not... together, but perhaps
we've seen each other.

47:39.790 --> 47:43.465
Mm-mm, want to get
a little bit closer tonight, right?

47:49.008 --> 47:50.351
Why not?

47:52.470 --> 47:54.472
Johnny.

48:01.479 --> 48:04.198
Would you get Mr. Hyde
some malt whisky, please?

48:04.356 --> 48:07.405
Hello, Mr. Hyde.
Becoming a real regular, eh?

48:07.568 --> 48:10.367
- Get on with it.
- Mr. Hyde, eh?

48:10.529 --> 48:12.657
Should I be Miss Seek?

48:12.823 --> 48:16.953
I used to play that game
when I was a little girl.

48:31.634 --> 48:34.137
Maybe I have been with you before.

48:34.303 --> 48:36.772
I've been with so many,
I can't even remember.

48:37.556 --> 48:38.624
You're new here?

48:38.724 --> 48:42.103
That's right, but I have got experience.

48:44.021 --> 48:46.115
Do you think I'm nice?

48:47.358 --> 48:51.329
Well, I don't know yet, do I?

48:53.072 --> 48:55.666
I'll do anything you want.

48:56.867 --> 48:58.995
Come on.

48:59.161 --> 49:01.755
Take my clothes off.

49:07.253 --> 49:09.506
Show me.

49:09.672 --> 49:14.178
Well, I'll just have to
take off yours, then, won't I?

49:31.443 --> 49:34.413
You're a big man, aren't you?

49:34.572 --> 49:39.499
Kinda like my stepdad.
If he could see me now.

49:39.660 --> 49:43.915
Gentlemen paying a pretty penny
for what he got free.

49:44.873 --> 49:50.050
I'll be the one in charge now.
He'd have to do just what I say.

49:50.588 --> 49:54.825
- What would you do?
- I'd make him kiss my bloody foot.

49:54.925 --> 49:58.225
No, my arse. And then I'd give him marks.

49:58.429 --> 49:59.351
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

50:00.014 --> 50:03.735
- How would you do that?
- Any way I could.

50:04.393 --> 50:07.046
But you couldn't punish him
if he was stronger than you.

50:07.146 --> 50:08.693
See, he wouldn't let you.

50:08.856 --> 50:14.408
You'd have to make sure that you
were stronger than he was, hmm?

50:17.656 --> 50:19.658
Hello.

50:28.626 --> 50:33.507
Susannah wants to do
unkind things to you, Johnny.

50:33.672 --> 50:37.097
Me? I never did anything
to the little tramp.

50:37.259 --> 50:38.181
Mmm.

50:40.095 --> 50:42.063
Aah!

50:44.266 --> 50:48.112
Don't talk to her like that,
you little shit.

50:52.149 --> 50:55.824
- You try it, Johnny. Come on, you try it.
- No. No. No!

51:03.577 --> 51:06.205
Take his trousers off.

51:24.390 --> 51:27.735
Tell her to take... to take hers off.
Go on, tell her.

51:27.893 --> 51:30.487
Take off your clothes.

51:34.066 --> 51:35.568
Whee!

51:35.734 --> 51:38.863
That's good. Now look at her good, Johnny.

51:39.238 --> 51:40.455
Ooh!

51:41.573 --> 51:43.917
- You like her, Johnny?
- Yeah.

51:48.914 --> 51:50.733
Ooh!

51:50.833 --> 51:53.928
Ooh, yeah. Do it, Johnny.

51:57.715 --> 52:01.310
Come on! Get on with it, you bitch!

52:05.389 --> 52:07.357
Yeah.

53:00.736 --> 53:04.411
Hello, Captain. Where are you going?

53:04.573 --> 53:06.642
Hello, handsome.

53:06.742 --> 53:08.744
What's the rush, sir?

53:10.871 --> 53:14.921
Don't go so fast, mister. You look like
you're running away from something.

53:15.083 --> 53:18.303
- Let me go.
- I know how it is to be in a hurry.

53:19.254 --> 53:22.508
I can be very fast.

53:22.883 --> 53:25.432
Come on, now.

53:25.594 --> 53:29.064
I'm sure you've got a minute to spare.

53:29.223 --> 53:34.586
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick,
Jack jumped over the candlestick.

53:48.033 --> 53:49.852
You see, we've ruled out that possibility

53:49.952 --> 53:52.626
because of the motor response
at all points on the leg.

54:08.679 --> 54:11.432
Would it simply be muscle atrophy
by this point?

54:11.598 --> 54:14.334
But haven't you understood
the correlation of the muscle fibers

54:14.434 --> 54:16.336
to the ganglial centers, Jenkins?

54:16.436 --> 54:18.609
Uh, well, sir, I...

54:18.772 --> 54:20.695
Henry!

54:28.031 --> 54:31.877
Henry!

54:32.995 --> 54:35.814
Hen...

54:35.914 --> 54:38.542
...destroyed, they could never regenerate.

54:38.709 --> 54:40.803
- They tricked me.
- What, sir?

54:41.670 --> 54:44.072
- Who did?
- Hmm?

54:44.172 --> 54:46.174
Who did, sir?

54:49.469 --> 54:52.473
What business is it of... of yours?

54:55.100 --> 54:57.148
I'm sorry.

54:58.061 --> 55:00.610
Thank you, gentlemen.
That'll be all for today.

55:00.814 --> 55:04.239
It's the most horrid thing
I've ever heard. Poor woman.

55:04.443 --> 55:06.821
No human being
should have to suffer like that.

55:06.987 --> 55:08.989
May God show mercy when my time comes.

55:09.156 --> 55:12.501
What's that you're talking about?
Something in the newspapers today?

55:12.659 --> 55:14.645
Newspapers? No, sir.

55:14.745 --> 55:19.216
My uncle's wife.
She finally slipped away last week.

55:19.416 --> 55:23.046
I'm sorry...
Please, carry on with your work.

55:32.095 --> 55:35.474
Well, I've never spent
so much time in a church.

55:35.641 --> 55:40.272
Better than on the street after the way
he ripped Vera Lockton up last night.

55:40.479 --> 55:44.950
Never... Never once had to take
a handout in me life.

55:45.108 --> 55:48.078
A girl could make a decent living
before there were murderers

55:48.236 --> 55:52.036
wanting to chop up every pretty
young thing on the streets.

55:52.199 --> 55:53.851
Well, then, in your case,

55:53.951 --> 55:56.625
I don't think there's anything
to worry about.

55:56.787 --> 55:59.256
Ha-ha. Very funny.

56:06.338 --> 56:10.013
Mrs. Jekyll, we have a cab for you.

56:10.467 --> 56:11.994
Thank you. I'll be there in a minute.

56:12.094 --> 56:16.395
Hey, Nelly, you should have gone
to the free hospital, like me.

56:16.598 --> 56:20.978
I asked the doctor for a flush,
and he did.

56:24.314 --> 56:29.828
Hey, Nell, want me and the girls
to give you a quick chimney sweepin'?

56:32.572 --> 56:34.574
Reverend Fowler!

56:35.242 --> 56:37.244
Reverend Fowler!

56:39.997 --> 56:40.898
I'll get a doctor.

56:40.998 --> 56:43.842
No, no, get the driver.
We must get her to the hospital.

56:53.218 --> 56:55.162
Hello. I'm Mrs. Jekyll.
Where's my husband?

56:55.262 --> 56:57.230
Dr. Jekyll? I don't know.

56:57.389 --> 56:59.333
Well, could you find him please?
It's an emergency.

56:59.433 --> 57:00.685
But he's not here, ma'am.

57:00.851 --> 57:04.151
- Well, where is he?
- I'm afraid, I don't know.

57:04.312 --> 57:05.589
He's never here at night.

57:05.689 --> 57:07.737
What do you mean?
He works here every night.

57:07.899 --> 57:10.677
No, Mrs. Jekyll,
that's the only open door,

57:10.777 --> 57:12.905
and the doctor's never come
through it, or we'd have noticed.

57:13.071 --> 57:16.701
- Well, he's probably in his office.
- No, ma'am. I just passed it.

57:16.867 --> 57:19.495
- He's with a Mr. Hyde.
- Who is Mr. Hyde?

57:19.661 --> 57:22.064
Quickly, please!
Someone outside needs help.

57:22.164 --> 57:24.667
Get a doctor.

57:30.297 --> 57:32.516
Well, well.

57:32.674 --> 57:34.768
Mr. Hyde.

57:34.926 --> 57:37.329
- At least, you're here.
- Where's Susannah?

57:37.429 --> 57:38.914
She's busy.

57:39.014 --> 57:43.752
What, with all these murders,
there's practically nobody here at all.

57:43.852 --> 57:46.776
What about little Liza? You'd like her.

57:48.273 --> 57:51.527
Susannah! Susannah!

57:51.693 --> 57:57.291
Mr. Hyde!
Here, you can't do that, Mr. Hyde!

57:58.658 --> 57:59.750
Susannah!

58:00.410 --> 58:02.754
Johnny, come over here, quick!

58:06.416 --> 58:09.386
Mr. Hyde, calm down, sir.

58:10.003 --> 58:11.154
Get out!

58:11.254 --> 58:13.949
Get the gun, under my table, quick.

58:14.049 --> 58:18.019
- Hey, I paid for the little bitch!
- Keep your slut!

58:21.973 --> 58:25.068
Help a blind man, sir.

58:25.227 --> 58:28.356
Help a blind man, sir.

58:28.563 --> 58:31.157
Spare a copper.

58:51.128 --> 58:54.428
Like to take a little spin, sir?

58:55.674 --> 58:57.768
Some place you've never been.

59:01.346 --> 59:06.477
It's nice and warm inside, but you
can see that, though, can't you?

59:20.699 --> 59:23.043
- What's your name, sir?
- Jack.

59:23.201 --> 59:26.831
Pleased to meet you, Jack. I'm Margot.

59:26.997 --> 59:29.876
Frank, take Jack and me back to my place.

59:30.041 --> 59:31.634
Right, ma'am.

59:33.753 --> 59:35.755
Hup!

59:54.649 --> 59:58.954
Jack doesn't think you're going
to make a very good servant, Frank!

59:59.112 --> 01:00:03.162
He said you probably don't know
how to take orders very well.

01:00:03.325 --> 01:00:06.061
- Do you?
- No.

01:00:06.161 --> 01:00:09.106
- Is that 'cuz you're such a little shit?
- No.

01:00:09.206 --> 01:00:13.712
- He is. He is a little shit.
- Let's go.

01:00:23.178 --> 01:00:26.022
I said, I don't take orders.

01:00:26.181 --> 01:00:29.105
Oh, yes? Is that right? Is that right?

01:00:29.267 --> 01:00:33.864
- Are you sure?
- I give 'em, you little shit.

01:00:36.274 --> 01:00:37.651
Aah.

01:00:40.028 --> 01:00:42.247
Oh, Jack.

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:44.874
Where's your house?

01:00:45.033 --> 01:00:47.832
Somewhere else, Jack.

01:00:47.994 --> 01:00:49.837
This is not my neighborhood.

01:00:50.956 --> 01:00:54.927
This is just where we unload the shit.

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:56.507
Oh.

01:00:59.381 --> 01:01:02.931
Frank, it's empty. He hasn't got a penny.

01:01:03.134 --> 01:01:04.477
Bastard!

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:10.127
What's this?

01:01:11.309 --> 01:01:13.311
Frank!

01:01:26.574 --> 01:01:28.827
The ripper.

01:01:30.078 --> 01:01:31.204
The ripper!

01:02:36.811 --> 01:02:38.813
Elisabeth.

01:02:42.317 --> 01:02:46.163
- I needed you.
- What are you doing there?

01:02:49.282 --> 01:02:51.956
I went to the hospital.

01:03:16.351 --> 01:03:19.921
There's no Mr. Hyde, is there?

01:03:20.021 --> 01:03:22.023
Yes, there is.

01:03:28.446 --> 01:03:30.665
What does he want from you?

01:03:30.865 --> 01:03:33.914
I think he just wants to stay alive.

01:03:35.036 --> 01:03:38.916
- Well, where is he? Where do you go?
- He's very sick, Elisabeth.

01:03:39.374 --> 01:03:41.968
But he needs me. I have to be with him.

01:03:42.127 --> 01:03:44.550
I need you.

01:03:48.508 --> 01:03:53.230
Henry, is there someone else?
Please tell me.

01:03:53.388 --> 01:03:55.140
No, there's no one.

01:03:55.306 --> 01:04:01.063
Then, promise me, promise me,
Henry, you'll be here when I need you.

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:32.595
Dr. Jekyll, there's an officer from
Scotland Yard here to see you, sir.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.183
Inspector Newcomen.

01:04:37.348 --> 01:04:39.626
The chemist said you'd been
working with a drug like this

01:04:39.726 --> 01:04:42.361
- and might be able to help us, doctor.
- Hmm.

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:46.946
I have only seen it used as an anesthesia,

01:04:47.108 --> 01:04:50.408
but this... this...

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:56.267
appears to have been
restructured somewhat.

01:04:56.367 --> 01:04:59.211
Those girls could have used
an anesthesia, Doctor,

01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:01.398
the way he butchered them.

01:05:01.498 --> 01:05:02.565
Butchered, you say?

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:06.715
I understood the man had a rather
precise grasp of human anatomy.

01:05:06.878 --> 01:05:09.697
- Why did you think that?
- Well, the newspapers.

01:05:09.797 --> 01:05:12.596
- Ah. Is that what they said?
- Yes.

01:05:12.759 --> 01:05:16.809
Yes, also that you had a witness,
someone who could identify this...

01:05:16.971 --> 01:05:18.939
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

01:05:19.098 --> 01:05:22.102
Surely, you don't believe
the killer is a doctor.

01:05:22.268 --> 01:05:27.320
It's certainly a possibility, I suppose,
but I was about to say, Doctor,

01:05:27.482 --> 01:05:30.782
that description the witness gave us
seems a bit confused to me.

01:05:31.778 --> 01:05:33.121
Oh?

01:05:33.279 --> 01:05:35.306
He says it was a gentleman,

01:05:35.406 --> 01:05:38.785
yet he describes someone
with the strength of a wild beast.

01:05:38.993 --> 01:05:40.290
Wild beast?

01:05:40.453 --> 01:05:44.708
And who calls himself Jack. Does that
describe any of your associates?

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:46.651
Well, of course, there are
practitioners all over London

01:05:46.751 --> 01:05:49.220
called John, Jonathan, Jack,

01:05:49.379 --> 01:05:52.883
but then doctors are not usually known
for their great physical abilities.

01:05:53.091 --> 01:05:55.185
- Especially you.
- Me?

01:05:55.343 --> 01:05:57.412
Looks like someone got the better of you.

01:05:57.512 --> 01:05:58.538
Aah, some glass exploded.

01:05:58.638 --> 01:05:59.747
- Hazard of the profession.
- Right.

01:05:59.847 --> 01:06:01.724
- Of course.
- Well, if I can be of any further help...

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:03.668
As a matter of fact, you could.

01:06:03.768 --> 01:06:05.520
The coroner would appreciate
a second opinion

01:06:05.687 --> 01:06:08.798
as to whether or not our Jack
has had any surgical training.

01:06:08.898 --> 01:06:09.899
Hmm.

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:12.535
Perhaps you could stop by and take a look.

01:06:12.694 --> 01:06:15.743
Certainly. I'd be delighted to.

01:06:22.036 --> 01:06:25.506
No doctor could have done this.

01:06:31.212 --> 01:06:32.822
They're waiting, madam.

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:35.016
Do I really have to go through with this?

01:06:35.174 --> 01:06:38.428
- But it's your sendoff, madam.
- You don't understand, Bernadette.

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.518
I'm not going with Dr. Jekyll to Vienna.

01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:47.195
Bernadette, make sure
that Dr. Jekyll gets my note.

01:06:47.353 --> 01:06:48.320
Yes, madam.

01:06:48.479 --> 01:06:51.073
Where's Henry? The roads are bedlam.

01:06:51.232 --> 01:06:54.657
- Henry can't come, I'm afraid.
- Can't come? He must.

01:06:54.819 --> 01:06:55.762
But why not?

01:06:55.862 --> 01:06:57.910
He has to finish preparing his speech.

01:06:58.114 --> 01:07:00.537
Oh, that's rot.
He can finish it on the boat.

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:05.376
We've reserved a table at Darcel's
afterwards. No, he must come.

01:07:05.538 --> 01:07:07.415
- Henry! Henry!
- Ann, please.

01:07:07.582 --> 01:07:10.882
Ann, that conference
is very important for him.

01:07:11.085 --> 01:07:14.739
But what could be more important
in London tonight than going to the opera?

01:07:14.839 --> 01:07:17.888
The soprano is said to be quite
magnificent, and the tenor...

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.658
Oh, Henry!

01:09:03.363 --> 01:09:06.082
Yes, it's me.

01:09:07.033 --> 01:09:12.416
- I know it's you.
- Elisabeth, this work, it's made me...

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:14.817
What?

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:18.888
Exhausted. A bit mad. Not myself, but...

01:09:20.423 --> 01:09:23.176
Now that it's over,
after the presentation,

01:09:23.341 --> 01:09:28.189
I promise everything will be
the way it was.

01:09:28.346 --> 01:09:31.567
No. No, it won't.

01:09:34.854 --> 01:09:37.256
You said you needed me.

01:09:37.356 --> 01:09:41.907
Well, now I need you. To make me strong.

01:09:42.069 --> 01:09:44.071
I can't.

01:09:45.238 --> 01:09:48.037
- Darling, I love you so much.
- Please, don't.

01:09:48.242 --> 01:09:51.041
It doesn't make any difference anymore.

01:09:51.703 --> 01:09:53.752
Why?

01:09:53.915 --> 01:09:58.216
Because I have to look after myself now.
You can do whatever you like.

01:09:58.377 --> 01:10:00.926
- Darling...
- Don't.

01:10:03.257 --> 01:10:06.077
There's only one thing I want.

01:10:06.177 --> 01:10:12.310
To be with the most beautiful woman
in Vienna. Forever.

01:10:13.726 --> 01:10:16.104
Oh, Henry!

01:10:23.903 --> 01:10:25.905
Vienna.

01:10:26.072 --> 01:10:29.246
- I don't know if I'll be able...
- Shh.

01:11:45.151 --> 01:11:47.153
Henry?

01:11:48.863 --> 01:11:51.491
Henry?

01:12:37.203 --> 01:12:39.831
Henry?

01:13:38.889 --> 01:13:39.936
Henry?

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:10.387
Henry?

01:14:15.735 --> 01:14:16.586
Henry!

01:14:52.046 --> 01:14:55.721
Hello, sir.
Do you wanna come with me, then?

01:14:58.969 --> 01:15:00.611
Oh, my God!

01:17:04.678 --> 01:17:06.396
- Yes.
- Here you are, sir.

01:17:08.849 --> 01:17:11.318
Here we go!

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.028
Another ripper murder!

01:17:24.615 --> 01:17:27.243
Another ripper murder!

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.043
Another ripper murder!

01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:38.885
Yes, you're quite right, Elisabeth.
His behavior is very strange.

01:17:39.046 --> 01:17:41.925
He was here.
He said the trip had been cancelled.

01:17:42.091 --> 01:17:45.766
He was very agitated... but determined.

01:17:45.928 --> 01:17:49.978
Determined? About what?
Why did he come here?

01:17:52.393 --> 01:17:55.567
Do you know a Jack Hyde?

01:17:55.771 --> 01:18:00.197
Hyde? Yes. He's a patient of Henry's.

01:18:00.359 --> 01:18:04.535
- He's sick. Something peculiar.
- Hmm. Very peculiar.

01:18:04.738 --> 01:18:08.083
Gabriel, for God's sake,
tell me what you know.

01:18:08.409 --> 01:18:13.085
Well, Henry came to see me,
to change his will.

01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:17.426
He wants to leave everything,
but everything, to this Hyde.

01:18:17.584 --> 01:18:23.808
He asked me, no, he ordered me,
to execute the papers while he waited.

01:18:25.926 --> 01:18:28.554
It's very peculiar.

01:18:31.223 --> 01:18:33.125
But there must be something you can do.

01:18:33.225 --> 01:18:35.102
This man has a terrible hold
over my husband.

01:18:35.269 --> 01:18:38.318
- If I could just find him...
- I need 50 more men.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.984
The ripper's in Hyde Park,
the ripper's on London Bridge...

01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:45.012
The ripper's everywhere
except where we can catch him.

01:18:45.112 --> 01:18:46.889
I know something awful
is happening to my husband.

01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:48.616
Please, help me find this man.

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:52.453
The ripper's been spotted in King's
Cross, sir, by a constable, sir.

01:18:52.619 --> 01:18:53.620
Check it.

01:18:53.787 --> 01:18:55.539
I'll get some men on it right away, sir.

01:18:55.706 --> 01:18:57.879
Where did you get that scarf?

01:18:58.042 --> 01:18:59.669
It was in the hand
of last night's victim. Why?

01:19:02.004 --> 01:19:04.632
Oh. Nothing.

01:19:04.882 --> 01:19:08.261
I have a report on the ripper
sneaking into the back of the palace.

01:19:08.427 --> 01:19:10.555
- Check it.
- The palace, sir?

01:19:10.721 --> 01:19:13.315
Check them all.

01:19:15.059 --> 01:19:16.276
Oh...

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:19.901
Look after these, Thy flock, O Lord.
Forgive them for their trespasses.

01:19:21.565 --> 01:19:24.239
Even Grace, she went back to her husband.

01:19:24.401 --> 01:19:26.495
Never thought I'd see that
after the way he treated her.

01:19:26.653 --> 01:19:30.241
Maybe he beat her,
but it's better than to be murdered.

01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:34.249
Do any of you know
someone called Mr. Hyde?

01:19:34.661 --> 01:19:38.256
Oh, please. Please, I beg of you.

01:19:38.415 --> 01:19:40.918
Me. I do.

01:19:41.085 --> 01:19:42.403
You know a Mr. Hyde?

01:19:42.503 --> 01:19:45.177
Yes. I mean, a friend of mine,
she knows him.

01:19:45.339 --> 01:19:48.513
- Well, who is she?
- Nobody special. Just a friend of mine.

01:19:48.675 --> 01:19:51.996
She always says she go when she find
a good man to take care of her.

01:19:52.096 --> 01:19:54.724
- And this Mr. Hyde does?
- Yes, he fancied her.

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:56.984
She has a way with herself.

01:19:57.601 --> 01:20:00.445
- Where does he live? Do you know?
- No, I'm sorry.

01:20:00.604 --> 01:20:03.733
- What about your friend?
- Susannah? Oh, yes.

01:20:03.941 --> 01:20:06.740
She live on Taurin Road,
right by Madam Flora.

01:20:06.944 --> 01:20:09.117
Except she's gone.
Otherwise, she'd be here.

01:20:10.072 --> 01:20:16.296
Can you take me there?
Please. Please. It's very important.

01:21:32.237 --> 01:21:34.615
The cradle will fall

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:41.038
Rock-a-bye baby

01:21:41.205 --> 01:21:44.004
On the treetop

01:21:44.166 --> 01:21:49.013
When the wind blows the cradle will...

01:22:00.807 --> 01:22:02.480
Oh, dear God.

01:22:07.981 --> 01:22:09.983
Hello, darling.

01:22:12.236 --> 01:22:13.738
Oh, my God! Henry...

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.505
What brings you to our little party?

01:22:23.914 --> 01:22:29.136
You're in great danger, Elisabeth.
You must leave here at once.

01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:32.014
Henry. Henry.

01:22:32.172 --> 01:22:34.891
Come with me.
This is the drug. This isn't you.

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:38.429
On the treetop

01:22:38.595 --> 01:22:40.973
It is me!

01:22:41.139 --> 01:22:44.018
Henry, no! Henry!

01:22:44.184 --> 01:22:47.438
- No!
- Get away!

01:23:01.952 --> 01:23:04.330
- Johnny.
- Henry, stop it!

01:23:06.832 --> 01:23:07.924
Henry!

01:23:11.753 --> 01:23:14.381
- Henry.
- Come on, Johnny.

01:23:17.718 --> 01:23:20.346
He told you! He told you!

01:23:20.512 --> 01:23:22.480
- No!
- He told you!

01:23:24.558 --> 01:23:27.232
Johnny!

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:32.487
Henry! Henry, help me!

01:23:37.904 --> 01:23:39.497
Henry!

01:23:40.324 --> 01:23:42.577
No!

01:26:06.344 --> 01:26:08.813
Henry.

01:26:08.972 --> 01:26:11.395
Henry. Henry!

01:26:12.693 --> 01:26:13.689
No!

01:26:18.565 --> 01:26:24.197
You didn't think I was... dead, did you?

01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:32.250
Henry, no. Henry, no.

01:26:37.167 --> 01:26:38.419
No, Henry!

01:26:40.921 --> 01:26:43.674
No! No!

01:26:57.187 --> 01:26:59.565
Must have been a terrible shock
for you, Dr. Jekyll,

01:26:59.731 --> 01:27:02.384
to come back here and find your wife
murdered in such a way.

01:27:02.484 --> 01:27:04.553
Oh, yes, Inspector.

01:27:04.653 --> 01:27:07.281
The maniac must have followed her
home from the East End.

01:27:07.447 --> 01:27:12.453
- What was she doing in the East End?
- Charitable work for the church.

01:27:12.619 --> 01:27:14.062
Women of the streets.

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:16.773
He certainly wrecked your office
and laboratory.

01:27:16.873 --> 01:27:19.501
- He must be quite mad.
- Hmm.

01:27:19.668 --> 01:27:23.093
I'd better get back to trying
to find this monster.

01:27:23.296 --> 01:27:26.175
Thank you for your help, Dr. Jekyll.

01:27:27.133 --> 01:27:30.808
Every woman in London is in danger
as long as he's out there.

01:27:30.971 --> 01:27:33.690
Oh, I'll get him. Don't you worry.

01:27:33.849 --> 01:27:35.567
If he's out there...

01:27:36.726 --> 01:27:38.444
I'll get him.

01:27:39.062 --> 01:27:41.064
Good day, sir.

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:50.494
Paper! Paper!

01:27:50.657 --> 01:27:55.163
Read all about it!
Another horrible murder!

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:57.773
Jack the Ripper murder!

01:27:57.873 --> 01:28:01.753
Paper! Read all about it!

01:28:01.918 --> 01:28:04.341
Another woman slain!

01:28:05.046 --> 01:28:08.095
If he's out there...
