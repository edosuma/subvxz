00:02.640 --> 00:04.839
NARRATOR: Previously
on Dance Academy.

00:04.879 --> 00:06.480
-How about we take
your ballet from

00:06.519 --> 00:07.719
embarrassing to competent?

00:07.759 --> 00:09.480
-So we're good, right?

00:09.519 --> 00:10.519
-We're good.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.599
-I didn't know what
leukemia meant.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.839
7 years worth of treatment late
I went into remission.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.160
That's when I stopped dancing.

00:17.199 --> 00:18.519
-I'm going to like you if I'm
going to like you, but there's

00:18.559 --> 00:19.359
nothing you can do about it.

00:19.399 --> 00:20.039
-Fine.

00:20.079 --> 00:21.239
Like me then.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.600
-Mom's moved back to Brisbane
to be with Dad.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.160
They're trying to
sort things out.

00:26.800 --> 00:27.519
-[singing]

00:27.559 --> 00:28.399
Let me have a voice.

00:28.440 --> 00:29.079
Let me speak and be heard.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.640
[theme music]

01:22.519 --> 01:23.640
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN):
Breakfast.

01:23.680 --> 01:27.400
One egg, one banana, one
tub low fat yogurt.

01:27.439 --> 01:28.599
40 minutes cardio.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.480
50 minutes Pilates.

01:30.519 --> 01:32.840
One hour warm up, loosen ITB.

01:32.879 --> 01:34.319
Lengthen quads.

01:34.359 --> 01:36.799
Strengthen feet.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.159
So I like routine.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.200
I like pushing myself.

01:43.239 --> 01:45.799
I like the plan I made with
mum when I was 7--

01:45.840 --> 01:47.200
to be the best.

01:47.239 --> 01:48.159
-Zach.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.159
I have my dentist appointment.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.319
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): Because
there's nothing worse than

01:55.359 --> 01:56.480
being ordinary.

02:02.719 --> 02:03.400
-Abigail.

02:03.439 --> 02:04.560
New schedule.

02:04.599 --> 02:06.159
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): I
don't like change.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.840
I don't like deviating
from the plan.

02:07.879 --> 02:08.400
-No.

02:08.439 --> 02:09.719
No.

02:09.758 --> 02:11.038
No more daytime rehearsals.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.159
I told you, this can't interfere
with ballet.

02:12.199 --> 02:12.759
-OK, OK.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.759
Just come warm up.

02:17.199 --> 02:20.400
-And I like this feeling.

02:20.439 --> 02:21.800
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): [singing]

02:45.599 --> 02:49.520
-Chloe, you've had six dentist
appointments in three weeks.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.400
And you don't eat sugar.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.439
I smell a boy.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.599
-Miss Armstrong.

03:00.639 --> 03:04.199
Good, I've been looking
for you.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.360
Wait for me in my office.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.319
I need to talk to you about
your attendance.

03:09.479 --> 03:10.639
-Nice.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.800
-That was approaching
company standard.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.319
-I think I could get there with
a few extra sessions.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.840
-Well, I can't fit you
in again this week.

03:34.879 --> 03:37.120
The in-laws are in town.

03:37.159 --> 03:40.400
[ringing]

03:40.439 --> 03:42.159
-Hello, Zach's social
secretary.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.680
Your wife.

03:47.719 --> 03:49.560
-Hey.

03:49.599 --> 03:52.680
Yeah, I can pick some
up on the way home.

03:52.719 --> 03:54.159
Well, I should be about
20 minutes.

04:03.879 --> 04:06.400
[new email alert]

04:31.240 --> 04:32.639
-You have some truly woeful
music in there.

04:38.439 --> 04:40.639
Again?

04:40.680 --> 04:43.680
-Yes, let's take it one more
time from the top.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.680
-You've read the email.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.639
Now get the t-shirt and
join the protest.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.040
-What email?

04:50.079 --> 04:52.240
-How the teachers ranked our
chances in the Nationals.

04:52.279 --> 04:53.160
Got leaked.

04:53.199 --> 04:54.399
-Ew, drama.

04:54.439 --> 04:57.800
-The front runners
with a big check.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.279
Miss Tara Tiara.

05:00.319 --> 05:03.199
And Disgrace.

05:03.240 --> 05:07.680
And our very own superstar,
Reeder.

05:07.720 --> 05:08.560
-This is stupid.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.040
-No false modesty, please.

05:12.639 --> 05:13.279
Arms up.

05:13.319 --> 05:15.720
There you go.

05:15.759 --> 05:18.560
-I don't think you're a
question mark, Ben.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.680
Oh, how was your blood test?

05:19.720 --> 05:22.439
-White blood cells just
as they should be.

05:22.480 --> 05:26.680
-And now out of the running
our low achieving

05:26.720 --> 05:28.160
Liebermeister.

05:28.199 --> 05:30.519
-I'm booking the studio every
available minute.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.639
I'm going to prove them wrong.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.040
-We are.

05:35.079 --> 05:36.480
Really.

05:36.519 --> 05:43.319
-And Abigail, it's time to
embrace your inner X. At least

05:43.360 --> 05:44.519
it's definitive.

05:47.360 --> 05:51.720
-It is reprehensible that a
student would violate a

05:51.759 --> 05:54.600
teacher's personal property.

05:54.639 --> 05:56.199
And when I unearth--

05:56.240 --> 05:57.759
-Sorry, so we're the bad guys
here because you guys were

05:57.800 --> 05:59.120
caught playing favorites?

05:59.160 --> 06:01.839
-It was a private email
between staff members.

06:01.879 --> 06:03.560
-And guys, you're taking
this out of context.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.519
-How can a question mark be
taken out of context?

06:06.560 --> 06:08.600
-The email was a reflection of
where we thought you were at

06:08.639 --> 06:10.319
the end of last week.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.399
A lot can happen between
now and the Nationals.

06:12.439 --> 06:15.639
[coughing]

06:15.680 --> 06:17.519
-Abigail.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.199
You have class in
five minutes.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.319
-What's the point?

06:21.360 --> 06:22.519
You've written me off already.

06:27.199 --> 06:27.560
Finn?

06:27.600 --> 06:28.759
It's me.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.319
I actually can make it
to rehearsals today,

06:31.360 --> 06:33.040
so I'm on my way.

06:35.680 --> 06:36.800
-Abigail Elizabeth.

06:36.839 --> 06:39.319
You're not sick again,
are you, sweetheart?

06:39.360 --> 06:39.680
-Mum.

06:39.720 --> 06:40.240
Hey.

06:40.279 --> 06:41.680
-Hi.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.279
We're going to have to give you
some multivitamins, baby.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.639
What are you doing here?

06:45.680 --> 06:46.800
Where's Paige?

06:46.839 --> 06:48.319
-Paige is in Brisbane
with your father.

06:48.360 --> 06:52.519
But I'm here now, standing by
to do whatever you need

06:52.560 --> 06:56.120
between now and the Nationals.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.399
Where are you going?

06:57.439 --> 07:01.600
-Oh, just to the chemists.

07:01.639 --> 07:03.480
-Did you check your
sent items?

07:03.519 --> 07:06.800
Because I would have to delete
and then double delete.

07:06.839 --> 07:08.480
These fingers are
speedy, but--

07:08.519 --> 07:10.399
-I have no doubt you're
capable of it, Grace.

07:10.439 --> 07:12.519
-So put me on detention.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.639
Oh, right.

07:14.680 --> 07:18.160
You're too busy with your
hectic social calendar.

07:18.199 --> 07:19.480
-I guess I just have
to find the time.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.759
-You're throwing you
arms away, Sammy.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.279
That's why it doesn't
look like anything.

07:28.319 --> 07:32.120
[ringing]

07:32.160 --> 07:33.720
-Maybe if we turn
the music down?

07:33.759 --> 07:36.079
-What are you, 90?

07:36.120 --> 07:38.839
It needs to look like this.

07:38.879 --> 07:43.800
-Hello, this is Question
Mark Man.

07:43.839 --> 07:44.759
Yeah, sorry.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.240
This is Ben.

07:47.279 --> 07:48.800
-You're not going to
get there today.

07:48.839 --> 07:51.399
But that's what we're
aiming for.

07:51.439 --> 07:52.480
-Um--

07:52.519 --> 07:54.839
I thought--

07:54.879 --> 07:56.199
all right, see you then.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.480
-All good?

08:00.519 --> 08:02.199
-Yeah, I've just
got this thing.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.839
-I think I'm done, too.

08:06.879 --> 08:07.800
-Time for your nana nap?

08:07.839 --> 08:10.360
-You see how I'm not laughing?

08:10.399 --> 08:11.279
That's probably a
good indication

08:11.319 --> 08:13.319
the joke's not funny.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.800
-Bad day for criticism?

08:14.839 --> 08:16.800
-I wouldn't care that I
got an X. I wouldn't

08:16.839 --> 08:19.439
expect anything else.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.079
You, on the other hand, could
try a little positive

08:21.120 --> 08:21.839
reinforcement.

08:21.879 --> 08:23.399
-I'm about the tough love.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.639
-I thought you were
doing Cupid.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.759
Don Quixote.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.600
-No, Zach made me change
it last week.

08:39.558 --> 08:42.159
-Darling, you can get your
leg higher on the en

08:42.200 --> 08:44.679
tournants ops doneur.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.799
-You tell her, Mrs. Armstrong.

08:46.840 --> 08:52.039
-That's always a problem in the
en turn on ops [mumbling]

08:52.080 --> 08:55.120
-Mom, meet Grace.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.799
She's damaged on account
of her dad never having

08:56.840 --> 08:59.320
any time for her.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.559
-Oh, nice to meet you.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.759
-You don't have that problem,
do you, sweetheart?

09:06.799 --> 09:08.480
I mean I know haven't
been around

09:08.519 --> 09:09.840
much, but you're eating.

09:09.879 --> 09:11.399
Not too much, but enough.

09:11.440 --> 09:11.840
-I'm fine.

09:11.879 --> 09:14.559
-OK, good.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.799
Then you can cope with me
telling you that this solo is

09:16.840 --> 09:18.759
not doing you justice.

09:18.799 --> 09:20.600
-Unlike?

09:20.639 --> 09:22.200
-Your Helen Keller.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.759
People still stop me in
the street about your

09:23.799 --> 09:24.799
interpretation.

09:24.840 --> 09:26.399
Blind, deaf, mute--

09:26.440 --> 09:30.200
poor, poor girl.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.600
-It's just, the Academy already

09:31.639 --> 09:33.120
approved this variation.

09:33.159 --> 09:36.440
-Yes, but, your Helen Keller
won you the Sunshine Coast

09:36.480 --> 09:38.399
Regional Eisteddfod.

09:38.440 --> 09:41.600
And it will win you
the Nationals

09:41.639 --> 09:42.840
at the Prix de Fonteyn.

09:59.639 --> 10:02.559
-Pretty early for a Sunday
morning sesh.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.120
-I didn't sleep.

10:11.159 --> 10:12.360
-I don't want to be here, too.

10:12.399 --> 10:13.159
I'm Christian.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.679
I'm too cool to care.

10:16.720 --> 10:17.480
-Sorry, what?

10:17.519 --> 10:18.559
-Just say it.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.039
You want to win the Nationals.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.200
-OK, I want to win
the Nationals.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.399
Feel better?

10:33.600 --> 10:35.200
-My side.

10:35.240 --> 10:36.440
Your side.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.240
-I'm driving Charlie's parents
down the coast,

10:43.279 --> 10:44.440
so I want it sparkling.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.240
I'll grab you some wax.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.600
[coughing]

10:52.600 --> 10:53.679
-Detention.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.039
For that email leak.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.360
-Gee, that's funny.

10:58.399 --> 11:02.240
Thought I did that.

11:02.279 --> 11:05.440
-But you're an X.

11:05.480 --> 11:08.000
-Wow, Abs, that's really
masochistic.

11:08.039 --> 11:10.360
-Yeah, as is detention for
something you didn't do.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.279
-You don't need to confess.

11:16.320 --> 11:17.519
I probably owe you this one.

11:26.399 --> 11:28.240
-It's a present from Ben.

11:28.279 --> 11:29.759
Second thing he's
ever given me.

11:29.799 --> 11:30.519
-Kat.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.200
I need your help.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.559
Mum's had me doing Helen
Keller since 6 AM.

11:35.600 --> 11:36.519
-Oh, that solo gives
me nightmares.

11:36.559 --> 11:39.320
Not to mention your mother.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.000
So what is it that you need?

11:41.039 --> 11:43.759
-She's gone back to the motel,
but she'll be here any minute.

11:43.799 --> 11:46.759
I have to go meet someone,
so can you please?

11:46.799 --> 11:49.759
-In the name of love,
I will distract her.

11:49.799 --> 11:51.120
-You're in love?

11:51.159 --> 11:52.039
Me too.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.320
[coughing]

11:55.360 --> 11:56.679
-Oh, and I'd advice no tongue.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.360
You give a guy the flu and they
hold that against you.

11:58.399 --> 12:00.159
OK.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.759
-I don't think Ben has germs.

12:17.120 --> 12:17.759
-Hi.

12:17.799 --> 12:18.799
You don't mind, do you?

12:35.200 --> 12:36.360
-Um, you need to get
more height.

12:43.399 --> 12:44.559
-Yeah?

12:47.799 --> 12:49.120
You mean like that?

13:04.320 --> 13:06.600
-No dancing, no criticisms.

13:06.639 --> 13:10.480
Today's all about you, Sammy.

13:10.519 --> 13:13.159
-OK, does this is
look all right?

13:13.200 --> 13:14.399
-It's really trans-seasonal.

13:20.240 --> 13:23.120
-Ah, yes.

13:23.159 --> 13:25.039
Air hockey.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.159
I have to admit, I'm a bit
of a minor celebrity.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.440
-Really?

13:28.480 --> 13:30.559
-Yeah, games night down
at the synagogue.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.759
-You'll have to teach
me your moves.

13:35.759 --> 13:37.759
-Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.

13:37.799 --> 13:42.759
Me, me ma, mini mine ma, mini
mini ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.

13:42.799 --> 13:44.320
-Abigail?

13:44.360 --> 13:45.600
-I'm sorry I missed yesterday.

13:45.639 --> 13:46.720
It's just--

13:46.759 --> 13:49.159
-You look like you
should be in bed.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.360
-No, this is where
I want to be.

13:53.039 --> 13:56.559
-Mini mini ma, mini mini
ma, mini mini ma ma ma.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.000
Mini mini ma, mini mini ma,
mini mini ma, ma, ma.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.639
-Ah, that's me again.

14:09.679 --> 14:13.440
-You're just too fast.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.639
-Hey man.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.360
-This guy, listen to
everything he says.

14:19.399 --> 14:20.759
No one's broken his record.

14:20.799 --> 14:22.120
-Yet.

14:24.159 --> 14:25.600
-Is that right?

14:25.639 --> 14:27.080
You know they're talking about
doing another championship.

14:27.120 --> 14:30.679
You need to be here.

14:30.720 --> 14:31.559
-All right, excuse me.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.799
I've got some stuff to do.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.200
-Sammy, please stay.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.240
[coughing]

14:50.639 --> 14:52.600
-Ben.

14:52.639 --> 14:55.279
Look, you're sick.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.120
Go lie down.

14:57.159 --> 14:57.559
-You lie down.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.440
I'm fine.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.559
-Take a look at yourself.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.200
What is that?

15:02.240 --> 15:03.559
-It's nothing.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.039
-Ben.

15:06.080 --> 15:06.519
-Dude, it's nothing.

15:06.559 --> 15:07.679
I'm fine.

15:15.840 --> 15:20.240
-One of my test came back
with elevated levels.

15:20.279 --> 15:24.440
They gave me a bone marrow
biopsy today.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.240
-So did you get the
results back, or--

15:26.279 --> 15:28.720
-Tomorrow.

15:28.759 --> 15:30.360
I'm not telling mum and
dad anything until--

15:30.399 --> 15:31.559
-Yeah.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.559
-Look, the thing is--

15:35.600 --> 15:38.399
I'm not out of my five years.

15:38.440 --> 15:42.000
And so it's more than likely
that the cancer's--

15:42.039 --> 15:43.039
-Ben.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.200
You don't know that,
all right?

15:47.840 --> 15:49.360
-I've had a question mark
over my entire life.

15:52.399 --> 15:53.559
I don't want it any more.

16:03.399 --> 16:05.320
-Like a regular sewing
day in here, huh?

16:08.639 --> 16:12.279
-As these magic knots entwine,
let thou heart

16:12.320 --> 16:13.440
be linked to mine.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.440
-Love spell.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.679
-Tara, how come you don't
have Sunday training

16:20.720 --> 16:23.039
sessions like Abigail?

16:23.080 --> 16:25.120
-Oh, um--

16:25.159 --> 16:27.120
I have to go bury this under an
oak tree for twelve hours.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.679
-What?

16:31.720 --> 16:33.120
-You know how Abigail is.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.440
She's just so much more
dedicated than

16:35.480 --> 16:36.600
everyone else here.

16:36.639 --> 16:39.200
It's always cardio this
or pilates that.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.600
Then training, then
more training.

16:42.639 --> 16:44.279
-And rehearsals.

16:44.320 --> 16:47.559
For Revue, a new independent
musical.

16:52.399 --> 16:54.480
-Well that's a curve ball.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.559
-I only want you to say
the words today, OK?

16:59.600 --> 17:00.759
Don't try to sing.

17:08.519 --> 17:09.759
-So, Mia.

17:09.799 --> 17:11.319
Why would you like to
be in our revue?

17:14.200 --> 17:17.680
-To look at me, you'd
think I'm just the

17:17.720 --> 17:20.279
sum of all my parts.

17:20.319 --> 17:24.519
A nameless face that moves
through space to move other

17:24.559 --> 17:26.759
peoples hearts.

17:26.799 --> 17:28.519
But listen through me.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.559
See into me.

17:36.599 --> 17:39.359
This is where it starts.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.640
Let me have a voice.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.440
Let me speak and be heart.

17:44.480 --> 17:49.279
Let my spirit be stirred
with each perfect word.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.440
It's my choice.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.759
-Oh, Abigail.

17:52.799 --> 17:54.519
That was extraordinary.

17:54.559 --> 17:56.119
It sets us up so--

17:56.160 --> 17:59.359
-I'm sorry to interrupt, but
Abigail has training.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.000
-I'm Finn, director
of the show.

18:01.039 --> 18:01.680
You must be Abigail's mum?

18:01.720 --> 18:02.799
-Yes.

18:08.559 --> 18:09.440
Good luck.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.799
Nice to meet you, Finn.

18:11.839 --> 18:13.200
Now.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.440
-When I used to come with my
mum, I'd try to predict.

18:21.480 --> 18:22.799
Will you get good news,
will you get bad news?

18:33.799 --> 18:34.799
I hate hospitals.

18:34.839 --> 18:36.200
-Benjamin Tickle.

18:39.799 --> 18:41.160
-What's your prediction
this time?

19:00.640 --> 19:01.799
-So I lied.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.160
-Yeah, I noticed.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.640
-I mean the cardigan.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.599
That's not trans-seasonal.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.440
It needs to be burned ASAP.

19:09.480 --> 19:12.440
-You're seriously kicking
me when I'm down?

19:12.480 --> 19:15.000
-I'm not great with
the sensitivity.

19:15.039 --> 19:16.240
I'm competitive.

19:16.279 --> 19:17.359
And if there's a joke,
I'm going to make it.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.839
-Fine.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.680
But when crap stuff happens, I
don't need you there telling

19:20.720 --> 19:21.599
me I'm crap.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.480
-So you did mind being an X.

19:23.519 --> 19:24.279
-Yeah, I did.

19:24.319 --> 19:24.759
I really did.

19:24.799 --> 19:25.519
I hate it.

19:31.839 --> 19:33.200
-Get up.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.960
-Who's that for?

19:51.000 --> 19:54.400
-That's for the teachers at
the Academy, for always

19:54.440 --> 19:55.599
overlooking me.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.400
-There you go.

20:03.039 --> 20:04.720
Yep.

20:04.759 --> 20:07.119
-And that, that's for my dad.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.960
-I'm in the Nationals at
the Prix de Fonteyn.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.160
Book a ticket.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.400
-The arabesque and en
tourand is too low.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.720
Get your leg higher.

20:22.759 --> 20:25.559
Higher.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.519
-It's en tournant
en dehors, Mom.

20:28.559 --> 20:30.400
I'm pretty sure it's meant
to be at 45 degrees.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.400
-Really.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.759
I've been teaching ballet since
before you were born.

20:34.799 --> 20:37.079
-Well, you've been teaching
it wrong.

20:37.119 --> 20:38.400
-Now I know this isn't
your garage studio.

20:38.440 --> 20:40.200
But this is the National
Academy.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.359
This isn't some little
regional Eisteddfod.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.240
This is the Prix--

20:43.279 --> 20:44.559
I'm not doing this dance.

20:44.599 --> 20:48.359
-Darling, you're just tired
and you are run down.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.559
No doubt from rehearsing that
ridiculous musical.

20:50.599 --> 20:53.240
-It's not ridiculous.

20:53.279 --> 20:55.759
And it makes me happy.

20:55.799 --> 20:58.160
-I know what makes you happy.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.240
I have sacrificed everything
for your happiness.

21:03.440 --> 21:06.279
-Mum, thank you so much
for coming up.

21:06.319 --> 21:09.079
But I don't need you
here right now.

21:09.119 --> 21:11.279
So go home and I'll--

21:11.319 --> 21:13.079
just go home and I'll call
you in a few days.

21:15.759 --> 21:17.079
Mum.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.079
-There is no home.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.119
Your father's selling
the house.

21:31.319 --> 21:33.279
Paige wants to live with him.

21:33.319 --> 21:35.400
-What?

21:35.440 --> 21:37.480
Why wouldn't anybody
tell me this?

21:37.519 --> 21:38.559
-Because you're busy, with your

21:38.599 --> 21:40.240
training and the Nationals.

21:45.480 --> 21:46.119
-Mum.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.039
-You're right.

21:48.079 --> 21:48.680
I am.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.720
I'm out of my depth.

21:50.759 --> 21:52.119
-I was just saying that
because I'm tired.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.319
I'm sorry.

21:54.359 --> 21:58.160
I want you to stay, OK?

21:58.200 --> 22:00.960
-Really?

22:01.000 --> 22:01.400
-Yes.

22:01.440 --> 22:02.079
Sorry.

22:02.119 --> 22:03.240
-I'm sorry.

22:03.279 --> 22:04.400
One cuddle.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.440
Now come on.

22:08.480 --> 22:11.400
Let's do it again, just
from the middle.

22:11.440 --> 22:12.559
Try not to cough.

22:12.599 --> 22:13.759
Let's go again.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.759
-Zach, I couldn't get
the rust out.

22:18.799 --> 22:20.640
But Dad's probably buying
me a car soon.

22:20.680 --> 22:24.720
So you can drive that in
exchange for lessons.

22:24.759 --> 22:26.079
-Look at you.

22:26.119 --> 22:27.960
You have that cold.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
-Yeah, you're right.

22:31.039 --> 22:32.599
I have a cold.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.720
That's all I have.

22:34.759 --> 22:36.119
-But if I'd known,
I could have--

22:36.160 --> 22:36.720
-I love colds.

22:36.759 --> 22:37.400
-What?

22:37.440 --> 22:38.200
-I love colds.

22:38.240 --> 22:39.440
Let me say it agian.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.480
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN):
Breakfast.

22:43.519 --> 22:49.599
One egg, one banana, one
tub of low fat yogurt.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.519
Shoulders down.

22:51.559 --> 22:52.559
Ribs in.

22:52.599 --> 22:54.640
Turn out, Abigail.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.599
Success is 90% hard work.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.119
10% raw talent.

23:00.640 --> 23:03.400
I'm not a cross.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.279
I am a tick.

23:05.319 --> 23:08.559
If I don't deviate, if I
don't lose focus, this

23:08.599 --> 23:10.079
will happen for me.

23:10.119 --> 23:11.279
It has to.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.400
-Miss Raine, may I please
be excused?

23:15.440 --> 23:16.200
Cough syrup.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.200
[cough]

23:34.160 --> 23:37.079
-Finn, hi, it's me.

23:37.119 --> 23:38.559
Um, you're going to have
to find a replacement.

23:38.599 --> 23:43.079
Just-- rehearsals were
interfering too much.

23:43.119 --> 23:44.559
Bye.

24:05.559 --> 24:07.119
[theme music]
