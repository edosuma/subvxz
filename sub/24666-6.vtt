imaginations

22:49.126 --> 22:51.956
and people come here in search
of that divine decadence.

22:51.991 --> 22:53.613
- Yeah.
- And it is here.

22:53.648 --> 22:57.548
It definitely is.

23:01.518 --> 23:03.209
During the Weimar years
and later,

23:03.243 --> 23:06.074
just before and after
the Wall came down,

23:06.108 --> 23:08.973
Berlin became a refuge
for artists, writers,

23:09.008 --> 23:13.150
and musicians at a crossroads
in their lives.

23:16.533 --> 23:21.158
Most notably, in 1976,
David Bowie came here.

23:21.192 --> 23:23.609
Have a seat.

23:23.643 --> 23:27.475
Well, there we go.
There we go.

23:27.509 --> 23:30.167
Jim Rakete is
a celebrated photographer

23:30.201 --> 23:33.066
known for
his intimate portraits.

23:33.101 --> 23:35.655
He began his career
as a photojournalist,

23:35.690 --> 23:40.004
and in '76, captured the first
moments of David Bowie

23:40.039 --> 23:44.492
stepping off the train
in West Berlin,

23:44.526 --> 23:46.735
a city he would live and work in

23:46.770 --> 23:49.082
for the next three years.

23:49.117 --> 23:51.602
Bowie was exhausted
and burned out

23:51.637 --> 23:55.019
and looking for a new way
to live and to work.

23:55.054 --> 23:57.574
And the music he created
during that time

23:57.608 --> 24:01.094
was something truly
groundbreaking and new.

24:01.129 --> 24:03.027
The result was both
a professional

24:03.062 --> 24:04.857
and personal rebirth

24:04.891 --> 24:07.584
and some of the most powerful
and influential recordings

24:07.618 --> 24:11.173
of all time.

24:11.208 --> 24:13.762
Classics which
I'd love to play here

24:13.797 --> 24:17.110
but cannot afford.

24:17.145 --> 24:18.940
He wasn't a big name
at the time,

24:18.974 --> 24:21.701
but it was a historical point

24:21.736 --> 24:25.671
because he came to Berlin
the week after

24:25.705 --> 24:27.673
he split with his band.

24:27.707 --> 24:30.676
And from I.A.,
he went to Berlin.

24:30.710 --> 24:31.787
He had to regenerate from...

24:31.815 --> 24:33.575
Well, I.A. had been
really bad.

24:33.610 --> 24:36.682
I mean, apparently existing
only on cartons of milk...

24:36.716 --> 24:37.786
Yeah.

24:37.821 --> 24:39.547
And cocaine, I think,

24:39.581 --> 24:40.962
and not much else.
Yeah.

24:40.996 --> 24:43.585
He essentially came to Berlin,

24:43.620 --> 24:45.622
oddly enough,
given his reputation,

24:45.656 --> 24:47.244
to clean up.
Yeah.

24:47.278 --> 24:49.660
Clearly in really bad health,

24:49.695 --> 24:50.730
in a really bad place.

24:50.765 --> 24:52.042
Mm-hmm.

24:52.076 --> 24:53.975
And yet the music
that he made here

24:54.009 --> 24:57.323
was very different than anything
he'd done before.

24:57.357 --> 24:59.601
What do you think he found here
that was good for him?

24:59.636 --> 25:02.604
Well, he lived a pretty
low-profile life in Berlin.

25:02.639 --> 25:05.883
I have to say that.

25:05.918 --> 25:07.298
He could be anonymous here.

25:07.333 --> 25:10.647
Like, everybody admired him,
but nobody talked to him.

25:10.681 --> 25:14.271
That's a big advantage.

25:14.305 --> 25:15.928
And a funny thing is

25:15.962 --> 25:20.829
when you have that sort of
visionary pregnancy

25:20.864 --> 25:22.762
that you say
something's gonna come,

25:22.797 --> 25:26.594
something's gonna
fall from the sky,

25:26.628 --> 25:28.872
it does.

25:31.875 --> 25:34.636
Now, back in the early '70s
when David Bowie arrived,

25:34.671 --> 25:36.804
a lot of people don't realize,
but Berlin was surrounded.

25:36.811 --> 25:39.779
I mean, it was
essentially an island

25:39.814 --> 25:40.853
during much of that period.

25:40.884 --> 25:42.782
Yes, yeah.

25:42.817 --> 25:45.233
Outside of
whatever Bowie was doing,

25:45.267 --> 25:46.717
what was... what was it like

25:46.752 --> 25:49.030
in West Berlin at that time?

25:49.064 --> 25:51.929
It was like pressure cooking.

25:51.964 --> 25:56.209
You know, it was like
pressure cooking.

25:56.244 --> 25:58.764
West Berlin was
surrounded by the Wall

25:58.798 --> 26:01.629
and there were just three
roads leading to West Berlin

26:01.663 --> 26:04.977
and they were controlled by
the Russians, basically.

26:05.011 --> 26:09.809
So why would a walled city

26:09.844 --> 26:12.329
surrounded by hostile forces

26:12.363 --> 26:16.333
be such a hothouse
for art, music,

26:16.367 --> 26:18.093
and free expression?

26:18.128 --> 26:20.924
West Berlin was always
very international.

26:20.958 --> 26:23.616
We had, like,
people were flying in

26:23.651 --> 26:24.997
from all walks of life.

26:25.031 --> 26:27.620
Artists from all genres
were here,

26:27.655 --> 26:31.244
and we were surrounded by East.

26:31.279 --> 26:34.938
The Wall was a solid resistance,

26:34.972 --> 26:37.423
and you need a strong enemy to
build a strong muscle.

26:37.457 --> 26:39.805
And people who were living here

26:39.839 --> 26:42.014
had to improvise a lot.

26:43.187 --> 26:46.639
It's what is seen by many as,

26:46.674 --> 26:48.676
you know, a golden period.

26:48.710 --> 26:50.332
The Weimar Era was in fact

26:50.367 --> 26:54.371
a hotbed for music
and culture and art

26:54.405 --> 26:56.718
in between two
