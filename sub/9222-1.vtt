00:36.321 --> 00:38.156
Hey, you!

00:40.742 --> 00:42.827
Hold on.

01:47.183 --> 01:50.019
- Hilary!
- What?

01:56.525 --> 01:58.402
Keys.

02:13.667 --> 02:17.671
- Hey! Whoo!
- You couldn't handle it.

02:17.754 --> 02:21.216
What's up?

02:21.341 --> 02:23.886
<i>Get out ofhere!</i>

02:29.683 --> 02:31.602
<i>Now, these are a collector's item.</i>

02:31.768 --> 02:34.187
<i>You've got me on hold
for 10 minutes already.</i>

02:34.313 --> 02:36.606
<i>Look at that.
There's only 39 left.</i>

02:36.732 --> 02:38.608
Oh, I love that hat.

02:41.236 --> 02:43.363
And Roger Callahan...

02:43.488 --> 02:45.449
and Misty Ryan...

02:45.574 --> 02:47.409
and the Kinsella boy...

02:47.576 --> 02:49.995
<i>and-and his sister...
what's her name?</i>

02:50.162 --> 02:52.747
<i>- Rosemary.
- Rosemary. Exactly.</i>

02:52.873 --> 02:56.001
Out of that whole gang,
you were the smartest.

02:56.126 --> 02:59.796
- You had the best report cards.
- The best report cards.

02:59.963 --> 03:02.007
<i>And now she's a Realtor.</i>

03:02.132 --> 03:06.469
<i>She has a Cadillac
with a sign on it.</i>

03:06.595 --> 03:10.724
<i>Hello. Hello?</i>

03:10.849 --> 03:15.729
Hmm. Could you at least put out
the cigarette while you eat?

03:15.895 --> 03:20.734
<i>Hello. Oh, look at that!
There's only 15 left.</i>

03:22.610 --> 03:24.738
<i>Well, how 'bout
the business course, then?</i>

03:24.863 --> 03:27.615
<i>You could go back. You could.</i>

03:27.782 --> 03:29.909
Then call Danny.

03:29.993 --> 03:32.162
<i>Tell...</i>

03:32.287 --> 03:36.082
- A guy cheats on you once.
- Don't.

03:36.249 --> 03:39.794
<i>And you walk out on him
like he shot somebody.</i>

03:39.961 --> 03:42.922
<i>Go back to him,
yell at him, holler at him...</i>

03:43.047 --> 03:46.759
but make something happen,
Hilary, for once in your life.

03:46.968 --> 03:50.179
<i>At least he supported you.</i>

03:52.307 --> 03:54.600
You missed it, Mom.

03:54.684 --> 03:58.104
Didn't know it was gonna happen quite
that fast, though. Isn't she something?

04:18.791 --> 04:20.625
16 Nob Hill?

04:20.793 --> 04:23.588
- Right up those stairs, miss.
- Thanks.

05:15.848 --> 05:18.684
Uh, straight back and to the right.

05:18.851 --> 05:20.727
Thank you.

05:22.813 --> 05:25.149
Will you please! You too! Here.

05:34.825 --> 05:36.743
Hi. What's happening?

05:36.910 --> 05:39.788
Take a seat.
Fill this out, please.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.057
Hi.

06:04.980 --> 06:07.858
Does anybody have a pen?

06:09.484 --> 06:11.987
Thank you for coming.
We'll be in touch with the agency.

06:14.072 --> 06:16.741
Ms. O'Neil.

06:18.827 --> 06:20.662
Hi.

06:20.829 --> 06:23.832
I know you're nervous. Yes.

06:23.957 --> 06:27.711
- Please, have a seat.
- Everything's in place, so relax.

06:27.877 --> 06:30.422
<i>Yes, bags are packed.
Plane is waiting. Hotel is waiting.</i>

06:30.547 --> 06:33.758
<i>All of Japan is waiting.</i>

06:33.883 --> 06:36.469
She's not on the agency list, David.

06:36.594 --> 06:38.972
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

06:39.097 --> 06:41.891
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

06:42.058 --> 06:45.853
- I have my personal briefs in the suitcase with my socks.
- You're not on the agency list.

06:46.020 --> 06:49.440
Oh, no.
I'm answering the ad.

06:49.566 --> 06:53.695
The very moment, Marvin,
the second. Yes, I promise.

06:55.405 --> 06:57.782
<i>Right. Listen, Marvin.</i>

06:57.949 --> 07:00.201
<i>I have to... I have to go.</i>

07:00.284 --> 07:03.913
<i>- Take a pill, Marvin, please.
I'll see you in Japan.</i>

07:04.038 --> 07:05.957
Excuse me.

07:29.689 --> 07:31.899
<i>- Ah, yes, Miss...
- O'Neil.</i>

07:32.024 --> 07:34.610
I'm afraid, Miss O'Neil...

07:34.735 --> 07:37.113
my son ran this ad...

07:37.238 --> 07:41.992
<i>and, uh, long story short,
I need a nurse for my son.</i>

07:42.159 --> 07:45.663
- Are you a nurse?
- No, but I thought that it said...

07:45.871 --> 07:48.541
- I mean, only a few things...
- I'm sorry.

07:48.707 --> 07:51.377
Thank you for coming.

07:51.544 --> 07:53.879
No, thank you for having me.

07:54.004 --> 07:56.715
<i>- Give her cab fare, David.
- I don't want cab fare.</i>

07:56.882 --> 08:00.344
<i>- Give her cab fare.
- I don't want your goddamn cab fare!</i>

08:01.971 --> 08:06.433
Give her cab fare and 
hire the last nurse we saw.

08:08.644 --> 08:11.438
Miss. Miss, please, come back.

08:13.315 --> 08:17.152
Miss, the farther we go down,
the farther we must go back up.

08:17.319 --> 08:19.571
I'm not going back up.

08:19.655 --> 08:21.490
Understand, this is my duty.

08:21.657 --> 08:25.410
If I'm required to chase you back to,
God forbid, Oakland, I will.

08:25.577 --> 08:27.955
Oh, what a marvelous day.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.207
Yes, all... all right.

08:30.332 --> 08:33.919
And I quote,
"There has been a terrible mistake.

08:34.044 --> 08:38.549
Would you please come back to the house
for an informal interview downstairs?"

08:41.301 --> 08:44.554
- Downstairs?
- Yes. Please?

08:58.151 --> 09:00.862
Go ahead. It's all right.

09:07.744 --> 09:10.205
<i>Yes. Please come in.</i>

09:17.754 --> 09:19.589
I'm Victor Geddes.

09:26.721 --> 09:29.891
<i>- Trapped.
- Hey, what's goin' on here?</i>

09:29.974 --> 09:31.976
No, no. I.. I'm sorry.

09:33.228 --> 09:36.398
A joke. Um, an icebreaker.

09:36.481 --> 09:40.318
Oh. Well, I can see
why the job's still open.

09:42.779 --> 09:46.074
<i>- Ms. O'Neil?
- Hilary. Yeah.</i>

09:46.199 --> 09:48.076
Hilary.

09:51.246 --> 09:53.164
<i>Good.</i>

09:56.709 --> 09:59.420
This is going very well.

10:02.882 --> 10:04.717
How old are you?

10:04.884 --> 10:07.637
<i>- Twenty-three.
- I'm 28.</i>

10:07.804 --> 10:10.348
<i>You are not a nurse.</i>

10:10.473 --> 10:15.269
<i>- No, I am not a nurse.
- But you were a candy striper?</i>

10:15.436 --> 10:17.730
Well, yeah, in school...

10:17.897 --> 10:20.191
<i>but I dropped out.</i>

10:22.860 --> 10:27.281
Well, I was in
Future Nurses of America.

10:27.406 --> 10:31.035
I was the vice president.
Alert the media.

10:31.202 --> 10:34.121
No, that's...

10:34.288 --> 10:38.000
<i>- What did you do?
- We went to the hospital after school.</i>

10:38.167 --> 10:41.087
<i>- Mercy?
- Uh, Our Lady.</i>

10:41.253 --> 10:44.173
- Oakland.
- It's where I'm from.

10:45.883 --> 10:47.718
<i>I interrupted.</i>

10:47.885 --> 10:51.180
<i>- Oh, right. I dropped out.
- You worked there?</i>

10:51.305 --> 10:54.892
Right. Well, the sisters...
You didn't go to Catholic school?

10:56.685 --> 10:59.772
<i>The sisters at the hospital talked
to the sisters at the school...</i>

10:59.855 --> 11:04.485
and if we did something like, um...

11:04.610 --> 11:08.364
wear a skirt too short
or committed some mortal sin...

11:08.530 --> 11:10.366
such as French kissing...

11:10.532 --> 11:11.825
Ah.

11:11.909 --> 11:14.703
<i>Then we got the terrific
duties at the hospital.</i>

11:14.912 --> 11:16.914
- Bed pans.
- Bed pans.

11:17.039 --> 11:18.874
Changing sheets.

11:19.041 --> 11:22.628
<i>Uh, cleaning all kinds of things.</i>

11:22.795 --> 11:25.714
But sometimes they let us
change the babies...

11:25.881 --> 11:30.427
and then point them out
to their parents through the glass...

11:30.594 --> 11:32.596
<i>hold them up.</i>

11:34.056 --> 11:35.891
That's about it.

11:38.810 --> 11:41.396
I have leukemia.

11:41.522 --> 11:44.524
I've had it for, uh, 10 years.

11:44.650 --> 11:47.861
I'm 28. Uh... I said that.

11:47.986 --> 11:50.697
<i>So, since high school.</i>

11:50.864 --> 11:53.283
<i>U- Uh, not the whole time.</i>

11:53.408 --> 11:57.496
<i>I've had remissions.
I've led a pretty normal life.</i>

11:57.621 --> 12:00.916
Been to Europe.

12:01.041 --> 12:04.795
Finished college. Ran the dash.

12:04.961 --> 12:07.547
<i>The hundred.</i>

12:09.841 --> 12:13.136
You're not the first woman
in my house.

12:13.261 --> 12:16.181
<i>I, uh...</i>

12:16.348 --> 12:19.184
<i>Do you know anything
about chemotherapy?</i>

12:20.602 --> 12:23.063
Well, I know it's a treatment for...

12:24.898 --> 12:29.194
They give me a course of it
every time I fail their blood test.

12:31.613 --> 12:33.657
It, uh...

12:33.740 --> 12:35.658
it's pretty...

12:38.620 --> 12:41.748
Well, I need help during it.

12:43.958 --> 12:46.419
Want the job?

12:46.544 --> 12:50.298
You make it sound so attractive.

12:53.968 --> 12:56.095
<i>Your father said...</i>

12:56.262 --> 12:58.056
Forget my father.

12:58.264 --> 13:01.851
<i>- Well, he said you needed a nurse.
- Forget what he said.</i>

13:02.018 --> 13:05.855
<i>- Well, if he's the one hiring...
- He's not hiring.</i>

13:06.022 --> 13:10.276
He is flying toJapan
in a luxurious airplane. I am hiring.

13:12.779 --> 13:15.698
Uh, if you choose
to take this job...

13:15.865 --> 13:18.910
you will be working for me,
not for my father.

13:21.287 --> 13:23.581
So why would you pick me?

13:26.375 --> 13:28.211
Oh...

13:28.377 --> 13:30.379
I got it.

13:31.714 --> 13:33.925
I had the shortest skirt, huh?

13:37.929 --> 13:41.515
Oh, actually, no, there was one
with a shorter skirt...

13:41.682 --> 13:45.770
but he was never a candy striper.

13:45.895 --> 13:48.272
<i>Anyway, um...</i>

13:48.439 --> 13:51.025
it's room and board...

13:51.150 --> 13:53.944
and, uh, $400 a week.

13:56.655 --> 13:58.574
Cash?

14:04.246 --> 14:06.457
This is your room.

14:16.467 --> 14:18.886
If you take the job.

14:21.513 --> 14:23.307
He's got a cold, or what?

14:23.515 --> 14:25.309
- How sick?
- Cancer.

14:25.517 --> 14:27.978
Oh, shit, Hils.
Maybe I don't want to hear this.

14:28.145 --> 14:29.980
- Okay. How's Jim?
- Jim's a prick.

14:30.147 --> 14:32.232
How's his prick, then?

14:32.357 --> 14:34.193
Mike, give us two beers.

14:34.359 --> 14:36.862
Okay, so what's this guy look like?

14:37.070 --> 14:40.282
- Upper classy, Nob Hill.
- Hmm. College snot.

14:40.407 --> 14:43.202
- I kinda get the feeling that he was...
- He was what, Hils?

14:43.410 --> 14:45.871
- Cute.
- Well, go ahead, girl.

14:45.996 --> 14:49.124
- You gonna take it?
- I don't know. The place isn't bad.

14:49.249 --> 14:51.793
Fancy antiques. I have
my own bathroom. It's not in the hall.

14:51.960 --> 14:55.047
- How much a week?
- Four hundred big ones.

14:55.130 --> 14:58.592
Fuck me! Not you.

14:58.759 --> 15:01.219
Grab it, Hils.
Your mom would go crazy.

15:01.345 --> 15:04.431
You could buy the Cadillac she's always
talkin' about, go shoppin' every day.

15:04.514 --> 15:07.059
You can buy the outfit for me...
What?

15:09.978 --> 15:13.356
Just be cool, girl.
Don't worry about it.

15:21.990 --> 15:23.783
Hey, hey, baby.
You need a walk home?

15:23.992 --> 15:25.827
Hey, watch it.

15:39.341 --> 15:41.593
Yeah, yeah.

15:50.643 --> 15:53.021
Ah. Welcome.

15:53.146 --> 15:55.398
- Thanks.
- Oh, let me...

15:55.523 --> 15:57.567
Uh, that'll be all.
Thank you, Malachi.

15:57.650 --> 15:59.485
Yes, sir.

16:01.404 --> 16:03.740
That'll be all, Malachi.

16:04.908 --> 16:06.784
Wait.

16:08.202 --> 16:11.456
You coming in this room
is not part of the deal.

16:12.957 --> 16:14.792
I never thought it was.

16:16.627 --> 16:18.421
<i>Pardon me.</i>

16:18.629 --> 16:20.423
Uh, yes.

16:20.590 --> 16:22.425
- How are you doing?
- My friend, how are you?

16:22.592 --> 16:25.094
<i>- Fine.
- This is, uh, Moamar.</i>

16:25.261 --> 16:27.472
Moamar Gadhafi.

16:27.597 --> 16:32.018
He, uh, drives me every Monday
morning to the, uh, chemo.

16:32.185 --> 16:34.312
- Hilary O'Connell.
- My honor.

16:34.437 --> 16:36.147
O'Neil.

16:36.355 --> 16:38.983
O'Neil. I'm sorry.

16:45.489 --> 16:48.284
<i>Peter Schmidt, 1886.</i>

16:51.495 --> 16:54.290
<i>Barth and Kenitzer, 1892.</i>

16:54.457 --> 16:58.044
Both of them stood up
to the earthquake.

16:58.210 --> 17:00.004
The incomparable Hiss and Weekes...

17:00.212 --> 17:02.047
<i>1910.</i>

17:03.799 --> 17:06.343
Oh, Ronald McDonald, 1986.

17:12.808 --> 17:15.895
You know, the chemicals
they inject me with, th...

17:16.020 --> 17:19.231
Actually, they're poison.

17:19.356 --> 17:21.483
<i>- Poison?
- Mmm.</i>

17:21.608 --> 17:23.944
Hiss and Weekes again, 1911.

17:24.111 --> 17:26.780
Yes, the idea is to kill the cancer...

17:26.989 --> 17:30.159
and, uh, not me.

17:31.327 --> 17:33.495
<i>So, anyway, there might be
some reaction.</i>

17:33.662 --> 17:37.291
<i>- What kind of...
- Oh, sweating.</i>

17:38.959 --> 17:41.128
Shaking and vomiting.

17:43.088 --> 17:45.799
Sometimes it makes me scream.

17:47.426 --> 17:50.095
<i>Ah, Mercy Hospital.</i>

17:50.262 --> 17:52.139
1936.

19:33.197 --> 19:35.032
- Miss O'Neil?
- What?

19:35.199 --> 19:37.243
- Do you want me to stay?
- I don't know. No.

19:37.326 --> 19:40.163
I'll give him a call tomorrow.

19:49.005 --> 19:51.757
Okay. Okay.

19:54.385 --> 19:56.554
It's okay.

19:58.681 --> 20:00.683
No, no. No.

20:02.685 --> 20:05.938
- How's that?
- Thank you. Thank you.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.654
Oh.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.616
Too loud!

20:17.783 --> 20:21.579
- Too loud!

20:21.745 --> 20:25.332
<i>It's up... too loud!</i>

20:28.127 --> 20:30.379
<i>Too loud.</i>

20:30.462 --> 20:32.840
Okay.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.175
It's okay. It's okay.

20:35.259 --> 20:37.094
Come on. Come on, come on.

20:37.261 --> 20:39.096
Let me wrap this around you.

20:39.263 --> 20:41.765
- Oh, much too loud.
- No, I turned it down.

20:41.932 --> 20:46.103
- Much too loud. It's much too loud.
- It's okay. I turned it down.

20:58.949 --> 21:01.159
Come on.
Let me get you into the bed.

21:01.285 --> 21:03.829
Okay? I've got you.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.831
I've got you. I've got...

21:08.500 --> 21:10.335
Okay.

21:36.570 --> 21:38.613
The room is humming.

21:40.615 --> 21:42.826
Go to sleep.

21:48.206 --> 21:50.041
Go to sleep.

22:49.183 --> 22:51.060
Shit.

23:03.030 --> 23:04.824
Shit.

23:05.032 --> 23:08.035
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

23:08.160 --> 23:11.664
I don't... I don't get it.
What do you mean, "poison"?

23:11.831 --> 23:14.083
I mean poison.

23:14.208 --> 23:18.671
I mean, I thought he was gonna die.

23:18.796 --> 23:22.925
I thought, one more time
and this guy is gonna fucking die.

23:26.303 --> 23:28.639
Shauna, I need help.

23:28.764 --> 23:32.643
I feel sorry for him. I do.

23:32.851 --> 23:35.521
I don't think anybody comes to see him.

23:37.147 --> 23:39.733
<i>I wish I knew how to care for him,
but I don't.</i>

23:39.900 --> 23:41.902
<i>He needs a nurse.</i>

23:42.027 --> 23:44.780
<i>He needs somebody who can...</i>

23:44.947 --> 23:48.575
<i>deal with this sort of thing.</i>

23:48.742 --> 23:51.620
I don't think I can deal with this.

23:55.833 --> 23:57.835
I don't.

24:00.712 --> 24:03.131
<i>I'll have to tell him tonight.</i>

24:24.194 --> 24:26.655
<i>No.</i>

24:29.825 --> 24:33.662
You've reached the home of Victor
Geddes. Leave a message after the tone.

24:35.831 --> 24:38.416
<i>This is your father.
Are you there?</i>

24:38.583 --> 24:40.418
<i>I know you're there.</i>

24:40.585 --> 24:43.004
<i>I'm calling to find out
how the chemo went.</i>

24:43.129 --> 24:44.965
<i>Are you all right?</i>

24:45.131 --> 24:48.593
<i>I understand you didn't hire the nurse
from the agency. You got that redhead.</i>

24:48.718 --> 24:50.720
I guess I don't have to ask why.

24:50.845 --> 24:54.015
<i>I'll be back in a couple of weeks.
I love you, Victor.</i>

25:01.648 --> 25:04.651
- Dinner.
- Thank you.

25:04.776 --> 25:08.363
<i>- Eggs.
- Thanks.</i>

25:08.530 --> 25:11.783
That's all this redhead could find.
There's no real food in the house.

25:11.950 --> 25:14.285
No. No.

25:15.787 --> 25:18.081
Unless you want a Twinkie omelet.

25:18.206 --> 25:20.667
Twinkie omelet.

25:23.169 --> 25:25.171
Uh... Oops.

25:25.296 --> 25:27.882
<i>Oh. Oh, I'm...
Oh, God, I'm sorry.</i>

25:28.049 --> 25:30.510
- No, that's all right. It's nothing.
- No, it's...

25:30.635 --> 25:33.054
I'm sorry. Is this important?
Is this your diary?

25:33.179 --> 25:35.973
<i>No, it's nothing.
It's, uh, notes.</i>

25:36.182 --> 25:38.726
I'm, uh...

25:38.893 --> 25:42.146
This is what I do.
It's my Ph. D. Thesis.

25:45.108 --> 25:47.527
I've been working on it for five years.

25:47.693 --> 25:50.738
<i>When I can, uh, I will finish it.</i>

25:50.863 --> 25:52.698
I'm determined to finish it.

25:52.865 --> 25:55.660
<i>- What's it on?
- Uh, art.</i>

25:55.826 --> 25:59.038
<i>Art history. Do you know
the German impressionists?</i>

25:59.163 --> 26:00.915
Do they live in Oakland?

26:06.629 --> 26:10.508
<i>Do... Like, um, Renoir?</i>

26:10.716 --> 26:14.428
<i>Or, uh, Monet? Gauguin?</i>

26:17.223 --> 26:20.476
Uh, van Gogh.

26:20.601 --> 26:22.937
<i>- The flowers?
- Sunflowers.</i>

26:23.104 --> 26:26.273
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:26.440 --> 26:28.442
Well, that's not who I'm doing.

26:28.567 --> 26:30.277
Oh.

26:35.032 --> 26:37.493
Would you like to see
who I'm doing?

26:41.413 --> 26:43.749
<i>Klimt.</i>

26:43.874 --> 26:45.709
<i>Gustav Klimt.</i>

26:47.294 --> 26:49.588
<i>He was obsessed with women.</i>

26:49.713 --> 26:52.758
<i>He needed them the way
most people need food.</i>

26:54.885 --> 26:57.012
<i>Valerie Neuzil.</i>

26:57.179 --> 26:59.264
<i>He called her "Wally."
She was 16.</i>

27:00.891 --> 27:03.602
For a while, she was
the embodiment of it all...

27:03.769 --> 27:05.979
beauty, love, sex...

27:06.104 --> 27:09.942
<i>until he got bored
and passed her on.</i>

27:11.568 --> 27:14.071
<i>She lived only another
five years, then died...</i>

27:14.238 --> 27:17.282
<i>it is said, of a broken heart.</i>

27:17.407 --> 27:20.243
Too late for spying, Malachi.

27:20.410 --> 27:24.414
- Never too late, sir.
- Good night, Malachi.

27:24.539 --> 27:26.416
<i>Good night, sir.</i>

27:29.044 --> 27:32.506
<i>Dante Gabriel Rossetti.</i>

27:32.672 --> 27:35.425
Also obsessed,
but with just one woman.

27:35.634 --> 27:40.055
<i>Elizabeth Siddell, his wife.</i>

27:40.222 --> 27:45.101
<i>She was only 28 when she killed herself
with a drug called laudanum.</i>

27:45.310 --> 27:47.354
Beautiful name for a drug.

27:48.939 --> 27:51.691
<i>Rossetti couldn't stop painting
her image over and over again.</i>

27:53.193 --> 27:56.488
Until he died just a few years later.

28:00.116 --> 28:02.327
Um, Klimt again.

28:02.452 --> 28:04.245
It's called "The Kiss."

28:09.501 --> 28:11.669
Did he use real gold?

28:18.718 --> 28:21.179
I should have explained
the, uh, chemo...

28:21.387 --> 28:23.181
more clearly to you.

28:23.389 --> 28:25.225
<i>It wasn't fair.</i>

28:25.433 --> 28:28.144
<i>So, if you... if you'd like,
I can pay you now.</i>

28:28.311 --> 28:30.104
For the week.

28:30.313 --> 28:32.398
Uh, you've earned
every penny of it.

28:34.233 --> 28:38.029
<i>And, uh, we can... we can just...</i>

28:39.614 --> 28:42.367
you know, we can just, uh...

28:45.495 --> 28:47.288
It's okay.

30:07.159 --> 30:09.328
Thank you, Moamar.

30:13.457 --> 30:16.585
I'll pull this back for just a second.

30:16.710 --> 30:20.339
I was reading today
that the survival rate...

30:20.547 --> 30:22.674
of adult onset leukemia...

30:22.799 --> 30:24.927
is now 50%...

30:25.052 --> 30:27.804
and it is even greater...

30:28.013 --> 30:30.265
with aggressive therapy.

30:32.225 --> 30:34.936
Here we go.

30:35.145 --> 30:38.023
Was therapy
aggressive enough for you?

30:39.858 --> 30:43.111
<i>This is gonna get warm
in just a minute, okay?</i>

31:36.748 --> 31:40.001
No. Victor, what can I do?

31:40.126 --> 31:42.378
- What can I do? What do you want me to do?
- Nothing. Nothing!

31:42.545 --> 31:45.798
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing!

31:45.923 --> 31:48.468
There's nothing you can do.

31:48.634 --> 31:51.429
Not a goddamn
motherfucking thing!

31:51.637 --> 31:54.766
<i>Fuck! Fuck!</i>

31:56.267 --> 31:58.728
<i>Fuck!</i>

31:58.895 --> 32:00.771
Fuck.

32:03.357 --> 32:06.027
I'm right here.

32:06.194 --> 32:09.071
I'm right here.

32:13.326 --> 32:15.870
I know. I know.

32:16.037 --> 32:18.748
I know.

32:18.914 --> 32:21.167
All gold. That's right. All gold.

32:21.334 --> 32:24.503
<i>- This is the epitome, you might say...
- Oh!</i>

32:24.670 --> 32:27.298
She has teeth. See?

32:27.506 --> 32:31.677
<i>That is so rare.
You never see that.</i>

32:31.844 --> 32:34.930
I mean, anybody can paint
a little closed mouth...

32:35.055 --> 32:38.184
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
Tell me that's not a snake.

32:38.350 --> 32:41.228
It's a part of a snake.
The whole snake's too expensive.

32:41.395 --> 32:43.814
- He eats that?
- He doesn't eat.

32:43.939 --> 32:46.817
Well, Hilary, honey, make him a ham.

32:47.026 --> 32:49.278
I mean, it's hot.
It sticks to the ribs.

32:49.403 --> 32:51.280
<i>Ham has too much fat
and too much salt.</i>

32:51.488 --> 32:53.991
You can get two or three dinners
out of it and some sandwiches.

32:54.158 --> 32:59.413
Your grandmother never ate Chinese
snake for lunch, for Goïs sakes.

32:59.580 --> 33:03.042
<i>- Or Aunt Elma, who lived to be what...
- 206?</i>

33:03.250 --> 33:05.294
Ninety-two years old,
thank you very much.

33:05.419 --> 33:09.840
<i>She smoked a pack of Luckys and drank
a pint of scotch every day ofher life.</i>

33:10.007 --> 33:13.177
God rest her soul.
Did he pay you yet?

33:13.302 --> 33:15.053
He offered.

33:15.220 --> 33:18.932
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
And you said, "It's okay."

33:19.099 --> 33:23.562
And I'm not married,
and Rosemary Kinsella has a Cadillac.

33:23.729 --> 33:27.274
- Do you do his wash too?
- No, Mom, I don't.

33:27.482 --> 33:30.110
The man has cancer and weighs
14 pounds, but I tell him...

33:30.319 --> 33:34.323
"You want clean slacks? Then get off
your skinny ass and wash them yourself."

33:34.448 --> 33:37.659
I just thought maybe you were a nurse
instead of a cleaning lady.

33:37.826 --> 33:40.370
Who makes a better wage
than I do, by the way.

33:40.537 --> 33:43.707
<i>And is it possible...
is it just possible...</i>

33:43.874 --> 33:48.503
that he wants a little more
than a... ham dinner, huh?

33:48.712 --> 33:50.547
Uh-huh. Huh?

34:08.188 --> 34:10.734
Sorry. Is the music too loud?

34:10.942 --> 34:13.027
Uh, no. May I come in?

34:15.071 --> 34:17.197
Um, just a second.

34:26.416 --> 34:30.210
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:30.420 --> 34:32.672
- Is everything all right?
- Mm-hmm.

34:32.839 --> 34:35.967
You have something, um...

34:36.134 --> 34:39.512
Oh. Thanks.

34:41.431 --> 34:44.266
Oh, uh, did I say thank you
for the other night?

34:45.601 --> 34:47.853
You said "fuck" a lot.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.815
Well, thank you.

34:51.940 --> 34:53.735
So it's almost 8:00.

34:55.152 --> 34:58.239
<i>And, uh, you're not going out.</i>

34:58.364 --> 35:01.534
Uh, I mean you could.
You can. You're allowed.

35:01.701 --> 35:03.995
You don't have to stay home.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.956
- It's not, uh, part of the deal.
- Thanks.

35:07.165 --> 35:09.041
But you're not.

35:10.751 --> 35:12.879
So, um...

35:12.962 --> 35:14.755
how 'bout a date?

35:19.802 --> 35:22.138
<i>Malachi.</i>

35:22.263 --> 35:26.142
<i>- I, uh, let myself in. Yes.
- Let yourself in, yes.</i>

35:28.185 --> 35:30.187
Shall I leave you two alone?

35:30.312 --> 35:34.108
It's not necessary, sir. Your mail.

35:34.316 --> 35:36.110
And your news.

35:36.318 --> 35:39.071
<i>- Thank you for the personal delivery.
- My pleasure, sir.</i>

35:39.238 --> 35:43.367
<i>One additional news item. Your father
is returning at the end of the week.</i>

35:43.492 --> 35:48.330
And may I assume from the intense odor
of mayonnaise in the air...

35:48.497 --> 35:50.624
<i>that, uh, we will be
dining in tonight?</i>

35:50.749 --> 35:52.543
Actually, no.
We're going out.

35:54.128 --> 35:57.464
<i>Aren't we? Going out?</i>

35:58.757 --> 36:00.551
Sure.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.636
We're going out.

36:11.395 --> 36:13.814
You look great.

36:13.939 --> 36:17.109
<i>The Chronicle, the food review,
said it was the best new place in town.</i>

36:17.234 --> 36:20.946
- The best, uh... Isn't this great?
- It's great.

36:21.113 --> 36:22.906
- Okay.
- Oh.

36:26.493 --> 36:28.704
Okay.

36:30.289 --> 36:32.749
<i>- Great. Thank you.
- Certainly, sir.</i>

36:32.916 --> 36:35.711
My mother said you don't
have to like everything...

36:35.919 --> 36:37.796
but you have to try everything.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.798
Oh.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.300
My mother always said,
"Pass the Velveeta."

36:44.302 --> 36:47.055
<i>- What is it?
- Raw cow.</i>

36:48.974 --> 36:50.517
Dead.

36:50.684 --> 36:52.477
What if I throw up?

36:53.770 --> 36:56.314
Then I'll take care of you.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.609
Go ahead.

37:02.529 --> 37:04.948
Carpaccio.

37:05.115 --> 37:06.908
Carpaccio.

37:07.117 --> 37:11.288
- Isn't that great?
- It's great.

37:11.413 --> 37:14.499
What do they, um, charge
for something like this?

37:14.624 --> 37:17.168
I don't know. Uh, 30, was it?

37:18.753 --> 37:20.839
Thirty? Wow.

37:21.965 --> 37:23.842
- Wow.
- What?

37:24.050 --> 37:26.469
No, it's great.

37:26.594 --> 37:29.639
This place is great.

37:37.355 --> 37:39.148
It's not great, is it?

37:42.068 --> 37:43.945
Victor...

37:59.544 --> 38:01.337
- Hi!
- Hey, hey! Hil!

38:01.546 --> 38:04.424
<i>Baby! What's goin'on?</i>

38:04.632 --> 38:06.884
This is Victor. This is Jim.

38:07.009 --> 38:09.303
- How are you doin', Jim?
- All right, all right.

38:09.429 --> 38:11.305
- Come on. Let's jam.
- Shall we dance?

38:11.514 --> 38:13.558
- No, no, I'm...
- Could you hold my jacket?

38:13.683 --> 38:16.352
- Yes. Of course.
- Don't be nervous.

38:20.856 --> 38:24.026
<i>Are you dancing
or taking up space?</i>

38:37.248 --> 38:39.875
<i>- Watch out. Coming through!
- Whoa!</i>

38:46.590 --> 38:49.093
Excuse me! Excuse me!

38:56.475 --> 38:58.310
Sorry, man.

39:13.951 --> 39:16.078
- Hi.
- You were great.

39:17.663 --> 39:20.207
Thanks.

39:20.374 --> 39:22.167
<i>Hey, look out!</i>

39:22.376 --> 39:26.255
This place isn't really
that great either, is it?

39:28.340 --> 39:32.594
- Shall we go back to the restaurant?
- No.

39:53.657 --> 39:55.450
Arthur Rubinstein.

39:55.659 --> 39:59.204
<i>He was almost 80 when he played this.
I met him.</i>

39:59.371 --> 40:02.082
My... My mother took me
to his apartment. I shook his hand.

40:02.290 --> 40:04.334
Size of a basketball player's.
This little, skinny man.

40:04.459 --> 40:05.961
How'd she know him?

40:06.127 --> 40:08.505
He was a client
of my father's law firm.

40:08.672 --> 40:12.759
- Oh. I'm impressed.
- My father is a very impressive man.

40:15.679 --> 40:19.808
- Do I get a cigarette if I drink this?
- No.

40:19.933 --> 40:21.810
How is this one?

40:22.018 --> 40:23.812
- Mmm.
- Mmm?

40:24.020 --> 40:27.065
Mm-hmm.
And the hits keep coming.

40:27.190 --> 40:31.027
- It's awfully late.
- One more. This is the best one.

40:31.236 --> 40:34.531
I'm sure you have a story to go with it
about some beautiful dead woman.

40:34.697 --> 40:36.741
Yes. My mother.

40:38.159 --> 40:40.703
<i>This was her favorite song.</i>

40:40.870 --> 40:45.041
<i>She died when I was nine. 
She was beautiful.</i>

40:46.501 --> 40:49.045
I'm sorry.

41:04.602 --> 41:06.437
Dance?

41:52.149 --> 41:54.026
Thanks for the date.

42:00.115 --> 42:02.201
I'm done with the chemotherapy.

42:02.284 --> 42:05.746
<i>- Uh, that was the last one.
- Really?</i>

42:05.955 --> 42:08.582
Yeah. It's a course. It's over.

42:08.791 --> 42:11.126
I thought you had to take a test.

42:11.293 --> 42:13.837
- Would you like to call my doctor?
- No.

42:14.004 --> 42:16.674
- Go ahead. The number's on the desk.
- I said no.

42:18.801 --> 42:20.678
I'm sorry.

42:22.137 --> 42:26.183
Uh, that's what you get
for saving my life.

42:27.643 --> 42:29.436
Believe me, it's done.

42:29.645 --> 42:32.898
And, uh, to celebrate,
we are going away.

42:34.316 --> 42:36.109
- Where?
- Up north.

42:36.318 --> 42:39.154
I haven't been out of here for years.

42:43.408 --> 42:46.828
<i>- What about your father?
- Uh, I'll call him in the morning.</i>

42:46.995 --> 42:49.081
A vacation.

42:49.206 --> 42:52.000
I need to finish my thesis.
The door buzzes every five minutes here.

42:52.209 --> 42:55.671
<i>- Once in two weeks.
- It'll be an adventure.</i>

42:55.837 --> 43:00.050
We deserve an adventure,
a safe adventure.

43:00.175 --> 43:03.553
<i>It's only a couple-hour drive
right back to the hospital.</i>

43:03.678 --> 43:06.056
Look, I will sign a contract, okay?

43:06.223 --> 43:09.226
I, Victor Geddes, promise to return
if anything happens.

43:09.351 --> 43:11.144
Anything. You name it.

43:11.353 --> 43:13.438
- Like you die?
- No.

43:13.605 --> 43:15.440
I'm not going to die.

43:17.317 --> 43:20.904
I'm going to recover,
but I can't do it without help.

43:22.614 --> 43:25.450
I can't do it without you.

43:47.472 --> 43:49.641
- It's a 55 zone.
- What?

43:49.766 --> 43:52.143
If you drive any faster,
this heap will blow up.

43:52.310 --> 43:53.853
This is not a heap.

43:54.020 --> 43:57.315
This is a 1974 Cadillac,
bought and paid for by yours truly.

43:57.440 --> 44:00.526
- Nice color too.
- It's a cool color. It's a cool car.

44:00.693 --> 44:02.487
Can you say that, Victor?
"Cool"?

44:02.695 --> 44:05.281
I can say "70 miles an hour."
I can say that.

44:05.448 --> 44:07.909
Well, then... why don't you drive?

44:08.076 --> 44:10.953
No! Please don't do that.
I can't. I can't drive. Hilary.

44:11.162 --> 44:13.748
- Are you kidding me?
- Thank you for your compassion.

44:13.915 --> 44:16.209
I'm sorry.

44:16.334 --> 44:19.087
My father had a driver.
I never learned how.

44:19.295 --> 44:22.465
- I think it's time you started to learn.
- No, please don't do that!

44:22.590 --> 44:24.425
- It's cool, huh?
- Take... Take the wheel.

44:24.592 --> 44:27.470
I'm helping you. I'm helping you
stay between the lines.

44:27.678 --> 44:30.431
There you go.
You're doing fine. There you go.

45:16.060 --> 45:18.771
<i>- I know why you like it here.
- Why?</i>

45:18.979 --> 45:21.690
<i>- 'Cause all these buildings
have dates on them.</i>

45:23.150 --> 45:26.278
Oh, look at that.
Don't look. Watch the road.

45:32.367 --> 45:35.245
- Goin' a little fast?
- What?

45:35.454 --> 45:38.916
I'm kidding.
You're driving, like, 23 miles an hour.

45:40.083 --> 45:41.919
Scared you?

46:02.022 --> 46:04.149
Thank you.

46:22.334 --> 46:24.127
Oh, look. Hi!

46:24.336 --> 46:26.838
<i>We just moved in!</i>

46:31.426 --> 46:34.012
Kind and friendly neighbor.

46:52.530 --> 46:54.324
Here, let me get that.

46:54.532 --> 46:56.743
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

47:03.583 --> 47:05.460
You okay?

47:28.274 --> 47:30.151
So beautiful.

47:38.117 --> 47:39.911
What is this?

47:40.119 --> 47:42.747
Those are ampules of morphine.

47:44.206 --> 47:47.418
<i>- For pain.
- Isn't a doctor supposed to do this?</i>

47:47.585 --> 47:50.713
Oh, I know precisely what to do.

47:51.881 --> 47:53.674
Years of experience.

47:53.883 --> 47:56.552
<i>- Do you need one?
- No, I won't need one.</i>

47:56.719 --> 47:59.597
Put them away.
I won't need one.

48:21.160 --> 48:22.953
Oh, I'm sorry.

48:23.162 --> 48:25.539
No, it's okay. I'm done.

49:16.757 --> 49:18.550
Come on.

49:18.758 --> 49:20.635
- They'll start by staring.
- No, they won't.

49:20.844 --> 49:23.221
Someone will ask,
"Hey, man, why ain't you got any hair?"

49:23.388 --> 49:26.057
- They'll be too busy drinking.
- I've been to places like this. They always ask.

49:26.224 --> 49:28.018
- Come on.
- They always ask.

49:37.902 --> 49:40.113
Two beers.

49:45.702 --> 49:48.079
Thanks. Save the glasses.

49:50.999 --> 49:53.668
- You moved into Demazian's place?
- Uh-huh.

49:53.877 --> 49:55.712
Bring your foul-weather gear?

49:55.920 --> 49:59.132
Geez, you're gonna fuckin'
freeze to death up there.

49:59.257 --> 50:01.634
Weather-strip it. That'll fix it.

50:01.801 --> 50:04.888
<i>I've weather-stripped
around 30 houses. Works every time.</i>

50:04.971 --> 50:08.266
You mean you stripped
in about 30 houses.

50:10.810 --> 50:12.604
Anyway, I'd do yours.

50:12.812 --> 50:14.856
- Cappy.
- Hilary.

50:14.981 --> 50:16.774
- Thank you.
- Victor.

50:16.983 --> 50:18.776
How do you do?

50:18.985 --> 50:21.946
<i>Hilary, beer's on the house.</i>

50:22.071 --> 50:25.491
<i>- You're kidding!
- So, Vic, how come you shaved your head?</i>

50:27.160 --> 50:28.953
Yeah.

50:29.162 --> 50:31.789
He's a Hare Krishna.

50:31.998 --> 50:34.834
- No, you know, at the airport, the guys in the yellow...
- Saffron.

50:35.042 --> 50:37.503
- Robes, passing out flowers.
- Daisies.

50:37.670 --> 50:41.382
- Take off.
- With his little cymbals, singing.

50:43.301 --> 50:45.469
- Sing.
- What?

50:45.595 --> 50:47.930
- Sing, hon.
- Yeah, give us a few notes.

50:48.055 --> 50:50.558
No, I can't.
I can't.

50:50.725 --> 50:52.977
- I left the order.
- Come on, come on.

50:53.102 --> 50:56.689
- I gave back my robe and cymbals.
- Why?

50:56.897 --> 50:59.150
Because the order is celibate.
We're like priests.

50:59.275 --> 51:01.736
<i>- No kidding.
- Yes. Stricter, really.</i>

51:01.902 --> 51:06.240
And, uh, I shouldn't be
telling you this, but...

51:06.407 --> 51:10.035
- That's all right. We're good for it.
- Very private.

51:10.202 --> 51:12.455
Well, the truth is,
Hilary came along.

51:12.621 --> 51:15.958
I was at the airport, at United, which,
as you know, is the best location.

51:16.125 --> 51:18.544
And, uh, I was stopping people...

51:18.711 --> 51:21.422
giving them a flower and saying,
"God is love. Have a nice day."

51:21.630 --> 51:23.757
Then I stopped Hilary.

51:25.884 --> 51:28.304
She turned to me, and I knew.

51:28.470 --> 51:31.890
I stopped shaving my head the next day,
and we got in the car and came here.

51:32.057 --> 51:34.727
Probably her favorite
vacation spot. Right, hon?

51:41.024 --> 51:44.403
<i>Nah!</i>

51:44.570 --> 51:47.072
- No, no, no, no.
- Nice try, kid.

51:47.239 --> 51:49.575
That'll be 2.50 for the beer.

51:52.703 --> 51:56.331
That's good. That's real good.

52:08.260 --> 52:10.053
Are you okay?

52:12.347 --> 52:14.558
Do you need me?

52:20.230 --> 52:22.023
<i>Sorry.</i>

52:22.232 --> 52:25.944
Yes, I need, uh...

52:28.822 --> 52:30.657
I can't sleep.

52:33.034 --> 52:35.912
I, uh...

52:36.121 --> 52:38.498
I need to, uh, lie down...

52:38.665 --> 52:41.209
Next to you.

52:41.376 --> 52:43.461
I mean, I need to...

52:43.586 --> 52:46.756
I want to sleep... in your bed.

52:46.881 --> 52:51.386
<i>Not... Believe me, I'm no threat.
Not after the chemotherapy. I just can't...</i>

52:51.553 --> 52:56.099
This is not part of the deal.
Tell me to leave.

52:58.560 --> 53:00.603
No, it's okay.

53:04.524 --> 53:06.693
Okay.

53:36.764 --> 53:39.016
What does your tattoo mean?

53:41.561 --> 53:44.355
Strength of heart.

53:50.444 --> 53:53.239
- Good morning.
- Morning.

53:53.447 --> 53:56.242
- If I drink this, can I have a cigarette?
- No.

53:56.450 --> 54:00.204
No, I didn't think so.
Wait a minute. Show you something.

54:00.371 --> 54:03.124
Feel it. Feel it.

54:04.917 --> 54:07.128
- It's coming in.
- Yeah.

54:07.253 --> 54:10.423
- No fever. Is there?
- No.

54:12.675 --> 54:14.468
Uh, wait a second.

54:16.345 --> 54:19.431
- I have an idea.
- That's okay.

54:19.557 --> 54:22.768
- I'd like to tell you about it, but...
- But what?

54:22.893 --> 54:25.938
- But don't get mad.
- Why?

54:26.063 --> 54:28.816
Well, it has something
to do with...

54:29.024 --> 54:31.068
something you're sensitive about.

54:31.151 --> 54:33.487
My cooking? My clothing? My hair?

54:33.654 --> 54:35.781
Your education.

54:35.906 --> 54:38.492
You know, I have spent
my entire life studying.

54:38.659 --> 54:41.245
Years of lying in a bed reading.
Not what you were doing.

54:41.412 --> 54:44.123
- Sleeping with construction workers.
- No. Living.

54:44.331 --> 54:48.460
I am trying to learn a bit about that from
you, and I want to give you something back.

54:48.585 --> 54:51.713
To, uh, teach you.
Not school, but, uh...

54:51.839 --> 54:54.007
I see in you...

54:54.174 --> 54:57.261
I don't care about
your little jokes or anything.

54:57.344 --> 54:59.388
I see interest...

54:59.513 --> 55:01.974
<i>about things.</i>

55:03.559 --> 55:06.019
Tell me I'm wrong.
Tell me to go to hell.

55:06.144 --> 55:09.690
- Go to hell.
- Tell me you're not interested.

55:11.733 --> 55:14.027
What would you teach me?

55:14.194 --> 55:17.990
Uh, well, you like Klimt, right?
We start with a book on modern art.

55:18.198 --> 55:20.659
<i>You take a look at it, you read it.</i>

55:20.826 --> 55:22.953
<i>Then, uh, we talk. That's all.</i>

55:23.078 --> 55:26.206
<i>- You talk.
- No. I won't. I promise.</i>

55:29.167 --> 55:32.671
Damn it. I know I do that.
You can hit me if I start.

55:32.838 --> 55:35.715
<i>I mean it. Strike me. Humble me.</i>

55:35.924 --> 55:37.884
I will.

56:23.012 --> 56:25.974
My hair looks good.
Don't touch my hair.

56:51.624 --> 56:54.085
<i>Read 'em and weep.</i>

56:57.463 --> 56:59.215
<i>- Check.
- Check.</i>

56:59.423 --> 57:01.676
<i>- I'll bet.
- Oh, man, you got nothin'.</i>

57:01.801 --> 57:04.470
<i>- Go fish.
- Hon, hon, you have zippo.</i>

57:04.637 --> 57:06.889
<i>- Two dollars.
- Oh, come on!</i>

57:07.056 --> 57:09.433
<i>You're bluffing.</i>

57:09.558 --> 57:11.686
Put up or shut up.

57:11.811 --> 57:15.022
<i>- Two bucks. Cards for the players.
- I'm in.</i>

57:15.147 --> 57:17.900
I think they should
just change the rules.

57:18.067 --> 57:21.737
For instance, you get like partial
credit for a four... a four-card flush.

57:21.904 --> 57:24.657
<i>Especially if you have an ace.
I had an ace. It was the best ace.</i>

57:24.865 --> 57:27.618
The biggest ace.
The ace of spades. It was fan...

57:27.785 --> 57:31.622
A big, bold card, and it deserves
to beat a pair of deuces.

57:33.958 --> 57:36.001
You want to dance?

57:36.126 --> 57:39.338
You really are well,
aren't you, Victor?

57:39.463 --> 57:41.590
Yes, thanks to you.

57:47.346 --> 57:49.515
<i>What?</i>

57:49.682 --> 57:54.853
I don't know. Um...
it feels like the deal's over.

57:55.020 --> 57:56.688
What do you mean?

57:56.855 --> 57:58.941
<i>Well, like, the chemo's done
and you're better...</i>

57:59.024 --> 58:02.611
and, uh... I'm still taking money.

58:02.778 --> 58:05.322
<i>- That's okay.
- It doesn't feel right.</i>

58:05.531 --> 58:08.033
Maybe we should just go back.

58:08.200 --> 58:12.788
Back? Why would you
want to go back?

58:14.539 --> 58:18.168
Well, l-I feel like there's
no job here for me anymore.

58:20.128 --> 58:22.172
Is there?

58:35.560 --> 58:37.687
I guess not.

58:41.566 --> 58:43.944
Okay.

58:46.238 --> 58:48.031
<i>Good night.</i>

58:48.240 --> 58:50.242
Good night.

59:40.792 --> 59:43.252
Mmm. Hi.

01:01:00.537 --> 01:01:03.123
I have a confession to make.

01:01:05.876 --> 01:01:08.337
- You awake?
- No.

01:01:08.462 --> 01:01:12.090
Good. Then it'll be easier.

01:01:12.257 --> 01:01:14.092
I lied.

01:01:17.012 --> 01:01:19.890
There were never any
other women in my house.

01:01:21.558 --> 01:01:24.019
That's okay. I lied too.

01:01:24.186 --> 01:01:28.523
I was never vice president
of the Future Nurses of America.

01:01:38.408 --> 01:01:40.952
What about the picture
of you and that girl?

01:01:41.077 --> 01:01:43.789
- What picture?
- The one in your apartment.

01:01:43.955 --> 01:01:46.666
Jean. Jean.

01:01:48.752 --> 01:01:50.587
College.

01:01:52.714 --> 01:01:54.841
She was...

01:01:54.925 --> 01:01:58.762
I was in remission and...

01:01:58.929 --> 01:02:01.097
we were in love, I guess.

01:02:01.222 --> 01:02:03.725
I don't know.

01:02:03.892 --> 01:02:07.687
I got sick, she left.

01:02:11.775 --> 01:02:14.819
Now you're leaving
because I'm well.

01:02:14.944 --> 01:02:19.324
No. I just told you I don't want
to take your money anymore.

01:02:19.449 --> 01:02:21.743
Okay, no more money.

01:02:23.995 --> 01:02:26.748
I have to give you
something then.

01:02:26.915 --> 01:02:30.543
Mmm. No more art history
lessons, please.

01:02:32.086 --> 01:02:34.797
Well...

01:02:34.964 --> 01:02:38.176
then I have only
one thing to give you.

01:02:41.346 --> 01:02:43.181
My heart.

01:02:48.186 --> 01:02:50.313
You can have my heart.

01:02:56.527 --> 01:02:58.863
I couldn't say that before.

01:02:58.988 --> 01:03:01.991
You can't say that
to someone when you're sick.

01:03:02.116 --> 01:03:04.702
Yes, you can.

01:03:04.911 --> 01:03:07.705
I love you, Hilary...

01:03:07.914 --> 01:03:10.708
and I don't want you to leave.

01:03:18.758 --> 01:03:22.345
You don't have to say anything.
It's all right.

01:03:25.931 --> 01:03:28.392
I do have to say something.

01:03:31.353 --> 01:03:33.564
I want to...

01:03:35.524 --> 01:03:37.735
I want to say, um...

01:03:40.613 --> 01:03:45.034
You're a pain in the ass.

01:03:45.159 --> 01:03:48.996
But I know the sweetness in you,
and I know that you've changed me.

01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:54.835
And I want to say...

01:03:57.129 --> 01:03:59.173
thank you.

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:05.763
I won't leave you.

01:04:07.264 --> 01:04:10.058
Oh! It's cold!

01:04:27.618 --> 01:04:30.454
Never dare a Geddes.

01:04:35.917 --> 01:04:38.670
Good morning, Mrs. Merkel.

01:05:54.537 --> 01:05:58.541
<i>Hello? Anybody home?</i>

01:05:58.708 --> 01:06:00.793
<i>Hello?</i>

01:06:02.086 --> 01:06:04.881
- Hey. Time to strip the windows.
- Hi.

01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:07.675
Sorry I've been so long.

01:06:07.884 --> 01:06:11.304
I've been working up at this winery
for this old lady, making barrels.

01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:16.058
<i>She's crazy. She's got three 
husbands buried out there.</i>

01:06:16.267 --> 01:06:20.354
And she reads tea leaves.
I'm not kiddin'.

01:06:20.479 --> 01:06:22.773
She's crazy.
You gotta meet her.

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:27.236
Here's where your problem is.
Comes right off the water and right in.

01:06:27.403 --> 01:06:29.196
Feel.

01:06:30.781 --> 01:06:32.575
- Feel it?
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:32.783 --> 01:06:35.953
- Hello, Gordon.
- Vic! Hey!

01:06:36.078 --> 01:06:38.622
<i>- Hi. How are you doing?
- All right.</i>

01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:41.083
Uh... what are you doing?

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:43.586
I got a surprise.

01:06:50.968 --> 01:06:54.471
- Well, it is freezing in here.
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:54.638 --> 01:06:57.433
Call me insane,
but I'd venture a guess...

01:06:57.641 --> 01:07:00.436
that Gordon would like to
warm you up in any way possible.

01:07:09.278 --> 01:07:11.488
Cappy told me
you didn't have a TV set.

01:07:11.655 --> 01:07:13.490
Yes. Uh, no.

01:07:13.699 --> 01:07:16.702
<i>I guess we never... ever...</i>

01:07:16.827 --> 01:07:18.912
Well, it's only black and white.

01:07:19.037 --> 01:07:21.623
I don't use it, so...

01:07:21.874 --> 01:07:24.877
- Oh, I, uh...
- Here.

01:07:25.043 --> 01:07:27.170
I'll put it on the table.

01:07:27.337 --> 01:07:29.131
<i>Oh, cripes.</i>

01:07:29.339 --> 01:07:32.968
"Cripes"?

01:07:33.176 --> 01:07:35.387
Be careful. God.

01:07:37.389 --> 01:07:40.767
- Oh, no. It works.

01:07:40.934 --> 01:07:42.811
<i>Thanks, Gordon.</i>

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:48.400
I don't think... We're not really
very big, uh, television watchers here.

01:07:48.567 --> 01:07:50.861
But thanks. We're not, uh...

01:07:51.027 --> 01:07:53.530
- What is nectar?
- Absolutely right.

01:07:53.738 --> 01:07:55.740
<i>- Oh, wait.
- The Jetsons!</i>

01:07:55.907 --> 01:07:58.368
<i>- Are you a big fan of The Jetsons now?
- Go back one.</i>

01:07:58.577 --> 01:08:01.288
- Belle of Amherst.
- Emily Dickinson.

01:08:01.496 --> 01:08:03.623
- Duncan.
- Who is Emily Dickinson?

01:08:03.748 --> 01:08:06.585
- Correct.
- "TR" for 400, please.

01:08:06.751 --> 01:08:09.504
Answer there:

01:08:09.713 --> 01:08:12.090
- Troika.
- What is a troika?

01:08:12.257 --> 01:08:15.385
<i>- Yes.
- What is a troika?</i>

01:08:15.552 --> 01:08:18.930
<i>- What is a troika?
- It's a light Russian sleigh pulled by three horses.</i>

01:08:19.096 --> 01:08:21.850
<i>Uh, Glass Menagerie.</i>

01:08:22.058 --> 01:08:24.310
<i>- Duncan.
- What is Glass Menagerie?</i>

01:08:24.477 --> 01:08:28.106
<i>- What is Glass Menagerie?
- College snot. College snot answer.</i>

01:08:28.314 --> 01:08:30.942
<i>The most beautiful play ever written.</i>

01:08:31.151 --> 01:08:33.736
- Oh, the Mertzes!
- Who are the Mertzes?

01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:36.738
<i>- Correct.
- Who are the Mertzes?</i>

01:08:36.948 --> 01:08:39.742
We're just incredible. We're
an intellectually wonderful couple.

01:08:39.951 --> 01:08:42.453
<i>- Oh, wait! Wiggle her nose.
- What is wiggle her nose?</i>

01:08:42.662 --> 01:08:45.122
<i>- "Television" for 300.
- Cripes.</i>

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.462
- What are they talking about?
- David Cassidy!

01:08:51.671 --> 01:08:55.258
- Is that the actor? No, they want the character.
- Oh, Partridge. Keith Partridge.

01:08:55.466 --> 01:08:58.051
Too late. Sorry.

01:08:58.261 --> 01:09:00.763
- Strict standards here on television.
- It's under the wire.

01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:03.724
<i>- What are springs?
- Oh, shit!</i>

01:09:03.933 --> 01:09:06.477
You have to be quiet
while we're trying to watch.

01:09:06.644 --> 01:09:10.356
"To the moon, Alice!"

01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:12.567
<i>What is "To the moon, Alice"?
- Zoom!</i>

01:09:12.692 --> 01:09:15.278
<i>- Were you people weaned on television?
- "American History" for 500.</i>

01:09:15.486 --> 01:09:18.072
The last clue in that column:

01:09:20.241 --> 01:09:22.368
- Buchanan.
- Who was Abraham Lincoln?

01:09:22.535 --> 01:09:24.828
- Ha! You got it wrong!
- Shh! Buchanan!

01:09:24.996 --> 01:09:27.206
- James Buchanan.
- Oh, yes!

01:09:27.331 --> 01:09:30.334
<i>Thank you very much.
Hello, Jeopardy people!</i>

01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:32.420
<i>Send my money
through the Pony Express.</i>

01:09:32.586 --> 01:09:35.171
<i>Bring me a check.
Put it in my furry little hand.</i>

01:09:39.468 --> 01:09:41.970
Watch this and don't be frightened.

01:09:42.138 --> 01:09:44.180
- Oh.
- Ha!

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:46.892
I expect you to be duly impressed.

01:10:00.155 --> 01:10:03.409
<i>- Hey!
- That's great you made it.</i>

01:10:03.534 --> 01:10:05.536
- How are you?
- Good.

01:10:05.661 --> 01:10:08.706
- Casks.
- Yeah.

01:10:11.834 --> 01:10:13.669
- Oak.
- Oak, right.

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:15.963
He's an expert.

01:10:17.214 --> 01:10:19.007
Is that the cask room?

01:10:19.216 --> 01:10:22.469
<i>Want a tour? Come on.</i>

01:10:22.636 --> 01:10:26.140
There's this crazy old lady
who owns this place.

01:10:26.306 --> 01:10:29.893
She'll do anything I ask
because she loves me.

01:10:30.102 --> 01:10:34.565
Yes. Like a mother
loves her idiot child.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:36.733
This is Estelle Whittier.

01:10:36.858 --> 01:10:38.193
<i>- Hilary.
- Hi.</i>

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.195
<i>- Hello.
- Victor.</i>

01:10:40.362 --> 01:10:43.448
- How do you do?
- Victor.

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:47.994
<i>Uh, well, we thought
we'd take you to lunch.</i>

01:10:48.203 --> 01:10:50.330
- Victor's driving.
- Pass.

01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:54.000
Well, have lunch with me.

01:10:54.209 --> 01:10:57.462
How are you doing over here?
Want some more wine?

01:10:57.587 --> 01:10:59.464
All right.

01:10:59.673 --> 01:11:01.675
- Thank you, Annabel.
- You're welcome.

01:11:03.635 --> 01:11:05.512
<i>What?</i>

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.889
- It's a maze.
- Yes!

01:11:08.056 --> 01:11:10.350
<i>- Very good.
- Tell him what's in it.</i>

01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:13.061
- What?
- My three husbands.

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:16.648
- Dead.
- Buried, he meant to say.

01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:19.609
<i>By me.
Each one in their turn.</i>

01:11:19.818 --> 01:11:21.444
Good men.

01:11:21.653 --> 01:11:23.863
<i>No one knows where.</i>

01:11:23.989 --> 01:11:29.285
<i>Sooner or later, everyone tries
to find them and get back out.</i>

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:32.872
- Not many succeed.
- It can't be that hard.

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:37.168
<i>Take my word for it.
Step inside, and you're lost.</i>

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.758
Brewer's yeast.
"Delightful nutty flavor."

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:46.094
<i>- I'm sure.
- It's good for iron.</i>

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:48.972
- Iron!
- Oh, Tiger's Milk. Ninety-five percent protein.

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.641
"Four heaping teaspoons
in a glass of milk."

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:54.102
Just enough
to choke an ostrich.

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:57.438
<i>Help me find, um,
Royal Jelly. I need Royal Jelly.</i>

01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:59.565
Do you know
what Royal Jelly does?

01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:01.984
Is this a quiz?

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.612
- What?
- You look sweaty.

01:12:04.779 --> 01:12:06.989
- It's hot in here.
- Let me.

01:12:07.115 --> 01:12:09.826
Tsk. Warm.

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:12.161
My lips are warm too.

01:12:38.062 --> 01:12:41.857
Just a little night sweats, Vic.
It's just a little night sweats.

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:45.027
<i>What, honey?</i>

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:50.783
It's okay, baby.
Go back to sleep.

01:12:58.249 --> 01:13:00.876
More tea, Mrs. Whittier?

01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:04.129
Uh, no, thank you, Annabel.
It's time to read the leaves.

01:13:04.296 --> 01:13:07.841
Little baby Gordon doesn't
have to have his read.

01:13:08.008 --> 01:13:10.844
<i>- Thank you.
- I've already read his.</i>

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:15.557
<i>Ladies first.
Thank you, dear.</i>

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:18.560
Dum, dum, dum, dum.

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:22.106
- Hmm.
- What?

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:27.820
<i>A scattering. A road. A rabbit.</i>

01:13:28.028 --> 01:13:30.739
<i>- A bunny!
- A "cwazy wabbit."</i>

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:33.367
Is that good or bad?

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:35.869
It means luck.

01:13:36.036 --> 01:13:37.871
Luck at the end of a journey.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.873
<i>Out of confusion.</i>

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:42.668
- Really?
- And now Victor.

01:13:44.294 --> 01:13:46.421
Uh...

01:13:52.052 --> 01:13:55.055
Uh, I can read my own leaves.

01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:58.266
Yes. Another one
of my many hidden talents...

01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:00.268
<i>along with bocci
and advanced masonry.</i>

01:14:00.477 --> 01:14:02.521
Hmm. I'd rather forget.

01:14:02.646 --> 01:14:04.773
<i>How about that?</i>

01:14:04.898 --> 01:14:08.109
My future, it's something...
It's short, difficult.

01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:11.571
<i>Lots ofblind curves.</i>

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:16.451
Oh, my God! Why, it's a maze!

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.995
Not yet. Wait till I get up there.

01:14:19.162 --> 01:14:20.956
All right, all right.
Okay, wait a minute.

01:14:21.164 --> 01:14:24.668
<i>- Wait.
- All right. All right. Okay?</i>

01:14:24.834 --> 01:14:28.630
- All right?
- All right. Wait, wait. Go, go!

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:44.395
My first husband
built the damn thing.

01:14:44.604 --> 01:14:46.981
He used to run through it naked.

01:14:49.817 --> 01:14:52.695
- Gordon, I think we should go get him.
- Oh, no. He's doin' fine.

01:14:59.786 --> 01:15:01.871
<i>One minute, Victor!</i>

01:15:01.996 --> 01:15:04.415
Yes, yes, Gordon.

01:15:04.582 --> 01:15:06.918
The clock is ticking!

01:15:07.085 --> 01:15:11.297
Okay, let's find the center here.
We'll go...

01:15:11.422 --> 01:15:14.634
Damn it.

01:15:14.759 --> 01:15:17.595
<i>- Three minutes, Victor!
- Yeah.</i>

01:15:17.804 --> 01:15:20.097
Yes!

01:15:20.223 --> 01:15:23.392
Are you lost? Want some help?

01:15:23.559 --> 01:15:25.603
I don't like this.
I'm gonna go get him.

01:15:25.728 --> 01:15:27.980
- No! No, no, no.
- Let her go.

01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:33.027
Victor? Victor?

01:15:38.908 --> 01:15:40.910
Victor!

01:15:42.745 --> 01:15:44.914
Lost my head there for a...

01:15:45.081 --> 01:15:47.041
Jesus.

01:15:47.166 --> 01:15:50.419
Okay, find the center here,
and we'll get out.

01:15:50.586 --> 01:15:53.672
Goddamn it!

01:15:53.798 --> 01:15:57.009
Eureka.

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.738
Victor?

01:16:17.905 --> 01:16:20.991
Oh, God. Oh, no.

01:16:21.158 --> 01:16:23.285
Oh, no.

01:16:23.410 --> 01:16:26.997
Victor. Victor!

01:16:27.206 --> 01:16:32.044
Please. Please. No.

01:16:32.252 --> 01:16:34.797
Victor!

01:16:35.005 --> 01:16:37.132
<i>Victor!</i>

01:16:41.553 --> 01:16:46.350
Victor! Victor!

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.854
Why are you screaming?
Come along. Time's a-wasting.

01:16:51.021 --> 01:16:53.690
- You scared me. Why didn't you answer me?
- Shh. Come along.

01:16:53.899 --> 01:16:56.276
- Why didn't you answer me?
- Oh! Ha-ha!

01:16:56.443 --> 01:16:58.695
- There's a grave site back there.
- 12:24.

01:16:58.862 --> 01:17:02.199
12:24! Victor victorious!

01:17:18.507 --> 01:17:21.343
<i>- Oh, Victor.
- Jesus. Yes. You scared me.</i>

01:17:21.551 --> 01:17:24.721
<i>- Sorry. Will you get an extra blanket for the bed because...
- What? Why?</i>

01:17:24.846 --> 01:17:27.891
<i>- It was really cold, and I really don't want you to...
- Oh, okay... Mom.</i>

01:17:28.058 --> 01:17:29.851
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

01:17:37.692 --> 01:17:40.487
Too bad the maze
wasn't any longer.

01:17:40.695 --> 01:17:42.947
We could still be inside.

01:17:43.073 --> 01:17:45.075
<i>There's always Versailles.</i>

01:17:46.534 --> 01:17:50.371
You know, I told Estelle
you have a terminal disease.

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:53.124
- What?
- Asshole-itis.

01:17:53.291 --> 01:17:55.877
Asshole-itis.
Very cute. Thank you.

01:17:56.044 --> 01:17:58.129
Mm-hmm.

01:18:02.842 --> 01:18:04.636
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

01:18:04.844 --> 01:18:09.057
- Victor. Hey.
- What? What?

01:18:09.182 --> 01:18:11.476
- Can you...
- What?

01:18:11.601 --> 01:18:14.937
- You know.
- Do it? No. I can't do it right now.

01:18:15.104 --> 01:18:17.815
- Because you're sick?
- No. Because...

01:18:18.024 --> 01:18:19.817
Because you're sick.

01:18:20.026 --> 01:18:23.029
Because I can't always do it
when you want, all right?

01:18:23.196 --> 01:18:26.532
Perhaps I'm just not as prolific
as your construction worker friends.

01:18:26.699 --> 01:18:29.076
<i>- Fuck you.
- Oh, Jesus.</i>

01:18:29.243 --> 01:18:32.413
Think we can get through this
without a "fuck you," Hilary?

01:18:43.007 --> 01:18:44.800
Hilary.

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:49.889
Hils.

01:18:56.604 --> 01:18:58.397
I'm sorry.

01:19:01.108 --> 01:19:03.152
Are you sick?

01:19:03.277 --> 01:19:05.404
No.

01:19:05.571 --> 01:19:07.990
Would you tell me if you were?

01:19:09.783 --> 01:19:11.577
Yes.

01:19:22.087 --> 01:19:23.881
It's all right.

01:20:06.173 --> 01:20:07.966
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:20:08.175 --> 01:20:10.594
<i>- How are you?
- Fine.</i>

01:20:10.761 --> 01:20:14.765
<i>Oh, guess what? Estelle gave me this great
white dress ofhers for the Christmas party.</i>

01:20:14.890 --> 01:20:19.519
It's beautiful. Want to see what I got
my mom for Christmas? It's not a doll.

01:20:24.566 --> 01:20:27.569
Did you call your father
to wish him a merry Christmas?

01:20:27.694 --> 01:20:29.446
Give it a rest, hon.

01:20:31.907 --> 01:20:34.117
He doesn't know
where you are, does he?

01:20:34.242 --> 01:20:36.911
<i>I'll call him in the morning, okay?</i>

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:46.463
I ran into Gordon in town today.

01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:49.382
<i>- Great.
- I invited him to dinner tonight.</i>

01:20:49.591 --> 01:20:52.594
He didn't have anybody
to spend Christmas Eve with.

01:21:50.943 --> 01:21:53.362
I'll get it, hon!

01:21:57.033 --> 01:21:59.326
- Honey, it's Gordon!
- Merry Christmas.

01:21:59.493 --> 01:22:01.996
Merry Christmas.

01:22:02.163 --> 01:22:05.166
- Good to see you.
- Merry Christmas!

01:22:05.291 --> 01:22:08.043
<i>- Merry Christmas.
- I'm knocked out you asked me.</i>

01:22:08.252 --> 01:22:10.796
<i>Well, we're knocked out you came.</i>

01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:15.926
- Nothing.
- Nope, nothing.

01:22:16.093 --> 01:22:19.889
<i>Excuse me, Gordon.
I do the garbage around here.</i>

01:22:20.097 --> 01:22:23.434
- Did you bring us some figgy pudding?
- No. Presents.

01:22:27.855 --> 01:22:30.524
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

01:22:30.733 --> 01:22:32.526
Open it.

01:22:35.446 --> 01:22:38.490
- Bubble bath.
- Yeah. That's not all.

01:22:38.657 --> 01:22:41.285
Ooh.

01:22:41.493 --> 01:22:43.787
Bubble bath.

01:22:43.996 --> 01:22:46.957
- Merry Christmas.
- Whiskey!

01:22:47.124 --> 01:22:50.961
- It's 52 months old.
- It won't get a day older.

01:22:55.007 --> 01:22:57.092
Let's have a toast.

01:22:58.677 --> 01:23:02.848
<i>Okay, this is to... how great this is.</i>

01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:06.810
Really.

01:23:15.193 --> 01:23:16.987
<i>Okay.</i>

01:23:22.576 --> 01:23:24.661
Well, this is not like my mother's.

01:23:24.786 --> 01:23:27.539
<i>- There's not enough lumps
in the potatoes.</i>

01:23:27.747 --> 01:23:29.875
<i>My mother was
the worst cook ever born.</i>

01:23:30.041 --> 01:23:31.418
<i>No. No, my mother.</i>

01:23:31.585 --> 01:23:33.587
What did she make you
for lunch in school?

01:23:33.753 --> 01:23:35.922
Wait. Did she give you
a bag or a pail?

01:23:36.089 --> 01:23:38.508
A pail? Are you kidding me?

01:23:38.675 --> 01:23:42.387
<i>I had a pail.
It had the Six Million Dollar Man on it.</i>

01:23:42.595 --> 01:23:45.974
<i>And every time you
opened it, it squeaked...</i>

01:23:46.141 --> 01:23:48.601
<i>and everybody would look.</i>

01:23:48.768 --> 01:23:52.313
Did she give you, uh, peanut butter
and banana sandwiches?

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:55.525
No. Fluffernutters.

01:23:55.650 --> 01:23:57.652
Fluffernutters?

01:23:57.777 --> 01:23:59.904
Van Gogh.

01:24:01.114 --> 01:24:02.782
Huh?

01:24:05.118 --> 01:24:07.412
Van Gogh is the answer.
What is the question?

01:24:07.579 --> 01:24:10.582
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

01:24:10.665 --> 01:24:14.085
<i>- Too late.
- No. Again. Go again.</i>

01:24:14.252 --> 01:24:16.045
<i>Youngest president.</i>

01:24:16.254 --> 01:24:18.840
<i>- No, you have to ask the question with an answer.
- Kennedy.</i>

01:24:19.007 --> 01:24:21.634
- T.R.
- Who?

01:24:21.801 --> 01:24:24.971
- Colors of the French flag.
- Red, white and blue.

01:24:25.138 --> 01:24:29.142
- Blue, white and red.
- Oh, come on.

01:24:29.308 --> 01:24:31.853
<i>- Sculpted the Pietø.
- Do sports.</i>

01:24:32.019 --> 01:24:34.313
Michelangelo.

01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:38.151
Executed by Elizabeth I.

01:24:38.317 --> 01:24:40.570
<i>Do sports, for Christ's sake.</i>

01:24:40.695 --> 01:24:43.406
<i>Mary, Queen of Scots.
The "S"in U.S. Grant.</i>

01:24:43.614 --> 01:24:45.950
All right, wait a minute.

01:24:46.117 --> 01:24:49.662
Simpson. Grant. Grant Wood.
Grant. Grant Wood.

01:24:49.829 --> 01:24:52.498
<i>Come on, honey.
You should know this one. Grant Wood.</i>

01:24:52.707 --> 01:24:56.335
<i>American Gothic, for Christ's sake, honey.</i>

01:24:56.544 --> 01:25:00.047
Whoa, contestant number one,
hold up, hold up.

01:25:00.214 --> 01:25:02.425
Aren't you gonna play, sweetheart?
Oh!

01:25:02.591 --> 01:25:05.344
Victor, we'll play
if you do sports or sitcoms.

01:25:05.553 --> 01:25:08.055
<i>- Okay, we'll do sitcoms. Sitcoms? Great, okay.
- Yeah, okay.</i>

01:25:08.264 --> 01:25:10.850
<i>Uh, he wrote Lysistrata.
Aristophanes.</i>

01:25:11.058 --> 01:25:13.102
<i>Sitcoms, Victor.
Come on. Like Mr. Ed.</i>

01:25:13.269 --> 01:25:16.647
<i>Shakespeare. That's a sitcom.
She Stoops to Conquer. Oliver Goldsmith.</i>

01:25:16.814 --> 01:25:19.567
<i>- This is no English class!
- They're all situationally comic.</i>

01:25:19.775 --> 01:25:23.779
Hils, what is he doing? What are you
doing, Victor? For Christ's sakes.

01:25:23.946 --> 01:25:26.907
<i>Jesus, come on!
Nine. All right. Nine.</i>

01:25:27.074 --> 01:25:30.411
Nine!

01:25:30.577 --> 01:25:32.871
Hello! Hello in there!

01:25:32.997 --> 01:25:35.290
Gordon, don't.

01:25:35.416 --> 01:25:39.003
Number of players
on a baseball team, Gordo.

01:25:39.211 --> 01:25:41.714
<i>Here, let me help him.</i>

01:25:44.341 --> 01:25:46.969
All right. Okay.

01:25:52.891 --> 01:25:57.396
Just take it easy, Victor.
You'll be all right.

01:25:57.563 --> 01:26:00.148
<i>Come on. You'll sleep it off.</i>

01:26:00.357 --> 01:26:03.819
<i>Put your head down.
You'll be okay.</i>

01:26:14.955 --> 01:26:18.083
<i>Sorry I brought the bottle.
I didn't know that, uh...</i>

01:26:18.208 --> 01:26:21.211
- Neither did I.
- If I can do anything...

01:26:23.088 --> 01:26:25.090
Good night.

01:26:27.134 --> 01:26:30.679
Um, remember, if you need me...

01:26:30.846 --> 01:26:32.639
Thanks.

01:27:07.465 --> 01:27:09.509
Ugh!

01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:27.568
You lied to me.

01:27:29.821 --> 01:27:31.823
I'm sorry.

01:27:33.574 --> 01:27:35.576
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:27:35.701 --> 01:27:38.704
<i>I've been so crazy,
I don't know what's going on.</i>

01:27:38.830 --> 01:27:44.168
I didn't want... I don't...
don't want it to end.

01:27:44.335 --> 01:27:46.337
That's all.

01:27:48.214 --> 01:27:50.967
<i>- But you're sick. We have to go back.
- No, listen.</i>

01:27:51.175 --> 01:27:53.594
Can't we just pretend that, um...

01:27:53.761 --> 01:27:56.347
<i>- Pretend?
- Yes.</i>

01:27:56.555 --> 01:27:59.558
Yeah, that it, um, um...
that I'm all right.

01:27:59.725 --> 01:28:02.186
But you're not all right.
You're sick.

01:28:02.353 --> 01:28:04.730
- No, no. No.
- And you're going back to the hospital.

01:28:04.897 --> 01:28:07.400
- Listen to me. Do you love me?
- What?

01:28:07.566 --> 01:28:11.862
Just tell me. I know it's difficult.
I'm sorry. Just tell me.

01:28:11.987 --> 01:28:14.532
- Tell me.
- I don't like this.

01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:16.534
All right, all right, all right.

01:28:16.742 --> 01:28:19.370
I'm not going back.
I am never going back.

01:28:19.578 --> 01:28:22.414
I did lie to you. I wasn't through
with the chemotherapy.

01:28:22.623 --> 01:28:25.251
- What!
- Shh. Shh. My beautiful, sweet girl.

01:28:25.459 --> 01:28:29.255
I'm sorry. I had to.
It was killing me.

01:28:29.463 --> 01:28:34.093
You saw it.
That's why I chose you.

01:28:34.301 --> 01:28:37.012
Not just to come up here
with me...

01:28:37.221 --> 01:28:39.932
but to stay with me
no matter what happens.

01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:41.850
- No matter what happens.
- No!

01:28:42.059 --> 01:28:44.853
Shh, shh, shh!

01:28:45.062 --> 01:28:48.107
Just to stay for good... or whatever.

01:28:49.983 --> 01:28:53.946
Just no more hospitals.
No more treatments.

01:28:54.071 --> 01:28:57.282
No more.

01:28:57.407 --> 01:28:59.827
It is enough, Hilary.

01:28:59.993 --> 01:29:02.788
Ten years is enough.

01:29:02.996 --> 01:29:06.833
That's no life. I need a life.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.294
I have a life with you.

01:29:11.171 --> 01:29:14.508
- If you love me, you'll help me.
- Do what?

01:29:14.675 --> 01:29:17.844
Let it happen.
Just let it happen.

01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:21.348
- Let you die?
- No.

01:29:24.768 --> 01:29:27.104
When you decide?

01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:30.524
<i>You don't ask me or anything.
You just decided?</i>

01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:34.361
And then you want me to say...
You want me...

01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:36.947
You want me to tell you I love you?

01:29:37.072 --> 01:29:40.659
Then you can say, "Well, great. Now
I'm gonna die and I'm gonna leave you."

01:29:40.825 --> 01:29:43.495
Hilary.

01:29:43.662 --> 01:29:47.666
And you let me believe
that we had...

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:51.336
that I was part of something real
for the first time in my life.

01:29:51.503 --> 01:29:54.089
And the whole goddamn thing
was a lie!

01:29:54.255 --> 01:29:56.841
No, Hilary, I believed it too.

01:29:58.677 --> 01:30:01.221
I thought that this time
I wouldn't get sick again.

01:30:01.388 --> 01:30:05.141
<i>- I thought you could...
- What? That I could what?</i>

01:30:09.187 --> 01:30:12.607
<i>Do you have any idea
what it's like for me here?</i>

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:16.861
You know, every day...

01:30:16.945 --> 01:30:20.990
every fucking day I wake up
to see if you're still alive.

01:30:21.115 --> 01:30:24.827
I watch to see if you eat,
to see if you shit.

01:30:25.036 --> 01:30:27.789
<i>And you knew that you were
getting sick again the whole time...</i>

01:30:27.997 --> 01:30:29.791
<i>and you didn't tell me.</i>

01:30:29.999 --> 01:30:33.169
<i>How was I supposed to know?
Because I'm not a nurse.</i>

01:30:33.336 --> 01:30:35.922
I'm not a fucking nurse!

01:30:36.089 --> 01:30:39.092
You think I don't feel something
because I'm stupid?

01:30:39.175 --> 01:30:41.636
Fuck you,
because I feel something!

01:30:41.761 --> 01:30:44.180
I feel everything,
and I can't watch you die!

01:31:39.944 --> 01:31:43.447
- Hello.
- M-Mr. Geddes, this is Hilary O'Neil.

01:31:43.614 --> 01:31:46.408
- I'm your son's...
- I know exactly who you are, Miss O'Neil.

01:31:46.617 --> 01:31:49.328
I must tell you
that if my son is in any danger...

01:31:49.495 --> 01:31:53.290
Uh... he is.
That's why I'm calling.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.212
He's very sick, and I think you
need to come get him now.

01:31:58.337 --> 01:32:02.216
Yes. All right.
Where? Where is he?

01:32:02.424 --> 01:32:05.427
He's, um...

01:32:05.552 --> 01:32:07.596
Miss O'Neil...

01:32:10.516 --> 01:32:12.309
please.

01:32:12.517 --> 01:32:15.270
3 Main Street, Mendocino.

01:32:15.479 --> 01:32:18.857
Okay. Okay, okay.

01:32:19.024 --> 01:32:22.152
You did the right thing.

01:32:22.277 --> 01:32:25.280
Oh, Victor. Shit!

01:32:28.408 --> 01:32:32.120
Okay, okay.

01:32:41.129 --> 01:32:43.548
Victor, Victor.

01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:57.729
<i>I had the police looking for you.
I hired two detectives to look for you.</i>

01:32:57.896 --> 01:33:02.609
I just don't understand why... I don't
know why you would sneak away like that.

01:33:02.817 --> 01:33:05.111
<i>Do you hate me that much?</i>

01:33:05.278 --> 01:33:08.698
No. No.

01:33:12.786 --> 01:33:15.914
You're my father.

01:33:17.290 --> 01:33:19.083
I love you.

01:33:20.793 --> 01:33:23.463
<i>But I am not a boy anymore...</i>

01:33:23.630 --> 01:33:27.217
and I just wanted to be alone
with Hilary, that's all.

01:33:28.801 --> 01:33:31.012
All right.

01:33:31.137 --> 01:33:33.222
Yes.

01:33:33.306 --> 01:33:36.559
But when you're through
with the treatment.

01:33:36.684 --> 01:33:42.148
I mean, Victor, God, how could you
walk away in the middle of it?

01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:56.370
I wanted... her
to see me with hair.

01:34:01.667 --> 01:34:04.086
So why didn't you tell me that?

01:34:07.048 --> 01:34:10.801
- You think I wouldn't understand?
- Would you have let me go?

01:34:13.929 --> 01:34:16.015
No.

01:34:16.098 --> 01:34:18.768
Victor, believe me,
believe me, believe...

01:34:18.934 --> 01:34:22.563
I would love to hide away here,
too, with a beautiful girl.

01:34:22.730 --> 01:34:25.191
- It's the enchanted cottage.
- It was.

01:34:25.316 --> 01:34:28.819
But I am taking you
back to the hospital now.

01:34:40.915 --> 01:34:45.044
Okay. Okay, but tomorrow.

01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:46.962
- No.
- I'll go back with you tomorrow.

01:34:47.171 --> 01:34:49.214
- Victor, listen to me.
- There's a party tonight.

01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:51.383
Well, you...

01:34:53.177 --> 01:34:55.929
I have to see her one last time.

01:34:59.266 --> 01:35:01.351
I have to.

01:35:06.899 --> 01:35:08.692
Please.

01:35:13.530 --> 01:35:15.908
All right.

01:35:24.833 --> 01:35:26.960
Somebody dropped
something over there.

01:35:27.085 --> 01:35:30.547
Sylvia, bring that stuff
and put it right over there.

01:35:37.179 --> 01:35:40.974
I'm sorry I can't come
to your party tonight, Estelle.

01:35:41.183 --> 01:35:46.146
Victor is very sick, and I had to
call his father to come get him.

01:35:46.271 --> 01:35:49.357
I know. Victor called.

01:35:49.441 --> 01:35:53.320
He and his father
are coming tonight.

01:35:53.528 --> 01:35:58.700
You know... people think it's funny
that I buried three husbands.

01:35:58.867 --> 01:36:01.328
It's a joke around here.

01:36:03.371 --> 01:36:05.165
I don't know why.

01:36:05.373 --> 01:36:08.585
<i>It isn't funny at all...</i>

01:36:08.752 --> 01:36:13.757
<i>watching someone you love
get sick, is it?</i>

01:36:13.882 --> 01:36:16.718
I don't give advice, love.

01:36:20.638 --> 01:36:23.141
But if I were you...

01:36:23.308 --> 01:36:25.810
I'd be at the party tonight.

01:36:31.274 --> 01:36:33.735
Merry Christmas.

01:37:58.068 --> 01:37:59.862
Hello. I'm Victor's father.

01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:02.448
Hi. Gordon.
Nice to meet you.

01:38:04.283 --> 01:38:08.620
Thank you, Miss O'Neil.
You saved his life.

01:38:10.789 --> 01:38:13.417
- Is he here?
- Yes.

01:38:13.584 --> 01:38:17.129
<i>Well, he was standing
right over there a second ago.</i>

01:38:17.337 --> 01:38:19.548
You want to dance?
Let's dance.

01:38:19.673 --> 01:38:22.801
<i>- No, I don't think I...
- Come on, let's dance.</i>

01:39:14.311 --> 01:39:17.063
What's the matter?

01:39:17.272 --> 01:39:19.774
Um... I'll be back.

01:39:19.941 --> 01:39:21.735
Hilary...

01:39:44.674 --> 01:39:46.467
Victor.

01:39:59.147 --> 01:40:01.816
I'm sorry.
I had to call your father.

01:40:07.864 --> 01:40:09.657
I'm going back with him.

01:40:09.866 --> 01:40:12.243
<i>- To the hospital?
- Yes.</i>

01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:14.495
Good.

01:40:14.662 --> 01:40:16.831
They'll take care of you there.

01:40:19.542 --> 01:40:22.169
Tell Gordon he better
damn well take care of you.

01:40:22.378 --> 01:40:24.672
No, it's not like that.

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:28.509
I'll be going back
to Oakland soon, and...

01:40:28.718 --> 01:40:30.928
and I'll visit you, if that's okay.

01:40:32.972 --> 01:40:36.183
I think we should just...

01:41:06.547 --> 01:41:08.424
Good-bye.

01:41:20.644 --> 01:41:23.438
Well, I remember them. Of course.

01:41:23.647 --> 01:41:26.650
<i>They've moved into the area,
and they would love to see you.</i>

01:41:26.817 --> 01:41:29.653
<i>- Why don't you stop in and see them?
- Next time I'll do that.</i>

01:41:29.862 --> 01:41:32.072
- Mr. Geddes. Hi.
- Hello.

01:41:32.197 --> 01:41:34.491
I thought Victor
was going back with you.

01:41:34.616 --> 01:41:36.702
He is. Tomorrow.

01:41:36.827 --> 01:41:40.455
He, uh, wanted
to spend the night alone.

01:41:40.622 --> 01:41:43.834
Now, don't worry.
He's safe now.

01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:48.839
He said he'd call me
in the morning.

01:41:48.964 --> 01:41:51.716
<i>- Thanks.
- Merry Christmas, Miss O'Neil.</i>

01:41:55.387 --> 01:41:57.389
Excuse me.

01:42:44.769 --> 01:42:46.604
- You running away?
- Jesus.

01:42:46.813 --> 01:42:50.900
I thought that was my trick.

01:42:54.195 --> 01:42:56.781
No more tricks, Hilary...

01:42:56.948 --> 01:42:59.659
and no more hospitals.

01:42:59.867 --> 01:43:02.662
<i>I don't want to hurt you anymore.</i>

01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:05.039
I never wanted to hurt you.

01:43:05.164 --> 01:43:08.292
<i>You know, you are the first person...</i>

01:43:08.418 --> 01:43:11.921
in 10 years that made me
forget that I was sick.

01:43:14.549 --> 01:43:17.343
I just wanted
to stay here with you.

01:43:18.803 --> 01:43:22.098
<i>- To make love with you.
- Then where are you going?</i>

01:43:22.223 --> 01:43:25.810
You gonna hide somewhere
till you die?

01:43:25.977 --> 01:43:29.272
I can't let you do that, Victor.
I can't let you give up.

01:43:29.438 --> 01:43:32.024
I gave up when you left me.

01:43:32.233 --> 01:43:35.277
No, you didn't.
You gave up before I left.

01:43:37.238 --> 01:43:41.575
Hilary... I don't want
to be sick anymore.

01:43:41.742 --> 01:43:44.787
I know. That's why I want you
to come back with me.

01:43:44.912 --> 01:43:46.497
<i>- I can't.
- Why?</i>

01:43:46.664 --> 01:43:50.459
<i>- I'll drive you to the hospital. I'll carry you.
- I cannot do it.</i>

01:43:50.668 --> 01:43:51.836
<i>- Why?
- I can't do it.</i>

01:43:51.961 --> 01:43:54.046
<i>- Tell me why.
- Because.</i>

01:43:54.171 --> 01:43:56.799
Because I am afraid.

01:43:57.007 --> 01:43:58.759
Afraid of what?

01:43:58.968 --> 01:44:01.387
Of hoping!

01:44:09.478 --> 01:44:12.481
It hurts to be around you, Hilary...

01:44:12.606 --> 01:44:14.441
because...

01:44:16.276 --> 01:44:20.406
you make me want to live...
so much.

01:44:20.531 --> 01:44:22.950
Then live, Victor.

01:44:23.117 --> 01:44:25.452
You don't know
what's gonna happen.

01:44:25.619 --> 01:44:28.831
You don't know when
you're gonna die. Nobody does.

01:44:28.997 --> 01:44:32.793
But we have right now.
So fight, Victor. Live with me.

01:44:33.001 --> 01:44:34.795
- I can't.
- Live with me.

01:44:35.003 --> 01:44:37.339
I can't do that.

01:44:37.506 --> 01:44:40.384
Look at you.

01:44:42.344 --> 01:44:46.682
You are so... young...

01:44:46.848 --> 01:44:50.102
and so beautiful and smart.

01:44:50.227 --> 01:44:55.107
You can do anything, Hilary.
Anything you want to do.

01:44:55.315 --> 01:44:57.818
Why do you want to do this?

01:44:57.984 --> 01:44:59.986
Because I love you.

01:45:00.153 --> 01:45:04.783
And if you come back with me
to the hospital and fight for us...

01:45:04.991 --> 01:45:08.203
if you fight for us,
I will never leave you, Victor.

01:45:08.370 --> 01:45:11.540
But you have to fight.
And if you get well...

01:45:11.706 --> 01:45:14.543
when you get well...
l- I'll be there with you.

01:45:14.751 --> 01:45:18.546
And if you, if you die,
I'll hold your hand.

01:45:20.548 --> 01:45:23.426
I'll hold your hand.

01:45:23.635 --> 01:45:27.889
And the last thing
you'd ever see would be me...

01:45:28.014 --> 01:45:30.016
because I love you.

01:45:32.769 --> 01:45:35.563
I do.

01:45:37.273 --> 01:45:39.609
Oh, God.

01:45:49.285 --> 01:45:51.079
I love you.
