00:25.867 --> 00:28.632
- Dick Strong reporting
for Channel Nine News.

00:28.633 --> 00:31.229
We're at the home of
Valentina, Casa Villa's

00:31.230 --> 00:33.584
most famous socialite.

00:33.585 --> 00:35.984
We're gonna see what the
future holds for Valentina

00:35.985 --> 00:38.430
now that she has nowhere to live.

00:38.431 --> 00:41.095
They've taken her cars as
she leaves down the road

00:41.096 --> 00:43.588
with exactly what she
came to this city with.

00:43.589 --> 00:44.923
Nothing.

00:44.924 --> 00:45.757
Well, here she is now.

00:45.758 --> 00:48.044
Valentina, Dick Strong, Channel Nine News.

00:48.045 --> 00:50.937
- Actually, the reporters are here.

00:50.938 --> 00:53.494
- Do you have anything you
want to say to the audience?

00:53.495 --> 00:55.745
(mumbling)

00:57.168 --> 00:58.983
Well, you might not want
to word it quite like that,

00:58.984 --> 01:01.055
however, we'd like to know
where you're going now.

01:01.056 --> 01:02.993
- Oh, yes, I'm Valentina.

01:02.994 --> 01:04.613
I am great actress.

01:04.614 --> 01:05.614
Loo loo loo.

01:07.197 --> 01:08.773
- Well, there it is, ladies and gentlemen.

01:08.774 --> 01:12.194
Dick Strong, Channel

01:12.195 --> 01:13.028

01:13.029 --> 01:15.059
(mumbles)

01:15.060 --> 01:18.691
- Some gringo tell the
story about Valentina.

01:18.692 --> 01:20.547
I take it from here.

01:20.548 --> 01:23.887
I met Valentina a long
time ago, back in...

01:23.888 --> 01:25.709
(uptempo flamenco music)

01:25.710 --> 01:26.710
Columbia.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.288
Hello, my friends.

01:33.289 --> 01:35.027
We found our Valentina growing up

01:35.028 --> 01:37.645
in the little town of Villa Lobos,

01:37.646 --> 01:39.766
better known to the people that live there

01:39.767 --> 01:42.620
as the Village (mumbles).

01:42.621 --> 01:46.038
(uptempo flamenco music)

03:39.776 --> 03:41.851
Valentina has taken upon herself

03:41.852 --> 03:43.895
to raise the money for the church,

03:43.896 --> 03:47.315
but you need to realize her
dreams have gone to America

03:47.316 --> 03:51.311
and becoming successful, rich and famous.

03:51.312 --> 03:55.479
(uptempo flamenco music)
(cheering)

04:09.736 --> 04:12.168
Valentina visits the church (mumbling)

04:12.169 --> 04:14.919
of her decision to go to America.

04:18.853 --> 04:22.504
Oh, by the way, you need
to understand Chicanos,

04:22.505 --> 04:24.814
we cannot afford Chicanos for this film.

04:24.815 --> 04:27.065
(mumbling)

04:32.417 --> 04:34.834
(soft music)

04:42.893 --> 04:45.476
- Mom, I have made my decision.

04:47.682 --> 04:49.585
I'm going to America.

04:49.586 --> 04:51.752
(speaking foreign language)

04:51.753 --> 04:53.253
I want to succeed.

04:55.654 --> 04:59.614
I want my (mumbles) to be so proud of me.

04:59.615 --> 05:02.698
- God, God bless you in America baby.

05:04.218 --> 05:05.792
- Thank you, Mom.

05:05.793 --> 05:08.210
(soft music)

05:13.334 --> 05:14.167
- I love you.

05:14.168 --> 05:15.938
- I love you, too, Mom.

05:15.939 --> 05:18.356

05:21.747 --> 05:24.862
- [Narrator] Valentina's
love and respect (mumbles)

05:24.863 --> 05:27.280
and now she will say goodbye.

05:28.180 --> 05:30.410
- [Children] Valentina!

05:30.411 --> 05:32.578
(yelling)

05:43.299 --> 05:46.716
(uptempo flamenco music)

06:01.513 --> 06:03.831
The only man besides
her father in her life

06:03.832 --> 06:07.061
was her childhood friend
she planned to marry.

06:07.062 --> 06:11.229
She knew saying goodbye to him (mumbling).

06:25.579 --> 06:27.018
(mumbling) she knows he loves her more

06:27.019 --> 06:29.908
than life itself, however, he's been

06:29.909 --> 06:31.901
patiently waiting for the day

06:31.902 --> 06:34.386
they marry and be together.

06:34.387 --> 06:37.804
(uptempo flamenco music)

06:50.075 --> 06:52.440
He truly is a lucky fella.

06:52.441 --> 06:55.632
It's not like (mumbles)
Valentina in that way.

06:55.633 --> 06:57.492
It's not like she didn't have a chance,

06:57.493 --> 07:00.772
however, they didn't
move in the same circle.

07:00.773 --> 07:01.830
I love her.

07:01.831 --> 07:03.664
I mean what I am okay.

07:12.381 --> 07:15.230
The last night before
Valentina was set to leave,

07:15.231 --> 07:18.421
she made the second biggest
decision of her life.

07:18.422 --> 07:20.922
If only he would wait for her.

07:23.594 --> 07:24.677
Romantic, no?

07:26.113 --> 07:28.696
(somber music)

07:32.087 --> 07:35.560
Valentina with others
visited her father's grave

07:35.561 --> 07:38.061
to talk to him, seek guidance.

07:39.812 --> 07:42.197
She truly believes he hears her.

07:42.198 --> 07:44.615
He is always with her spirit.

17:31.769 --> 17:35.084
with a special report, Eye On Valentina.

17:35.085 --> 17:37.935
When we originally brought
you the story Bad Actress,

17:37.936 --> 17:40.002
the story we thought was just beginning.

17:40.003 --> 17:43.471
We thought it was basically
a bleed and lead story,

17:43.472 --> 17:46.481
but we found out later
it was so much more.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.193
There was a human interest
aspect to this story

17:49.194 --> 17:51.110
that was completely missed.

17:51.111 --> 17:54.249
You know, not only was Valentina evicted

17:54.250 --> 17:56.258
from her mansion with no where to go

17:56.259 --> 17:58.958
after (mumbling) went after Florida's

17:58.959 --> 18:02.141
most wealthy businessmen
only to have him disappear

18:02.142 --> 18:05.552
and have her left completely
abandoned and alone

18:05.553 --> 18:07.943
and she was coming, going into America

18:07.944 --> 18:11.254
with exactly what she
came here with, nothing.

18:11.255 --> 18:13.269
Now, as this special report continues,

18:13.270 --> 18:15.917
you're gonna find out
that with a Bad Actress,

18:15.918 --> 18:19.604

everything is as it appears.

20:18.311 --> 20:20.525
- Million dollars!

20:20.526 --> 20:23.457
- That is, if she is the best actress.

20:23.458 --> 20:24.345
Here's my card.

20:24.345 --> 20:25.178
You should enter.

20:25.178 --> 20:26.178
- Yes, yes.

20:26.980 --> 20:28.147
Loo loo loo.

20:28.148 --> 20:30.604
- You know, you might not be
such a Bad Actress after all.

20:30.605 --> 20:34.605
You get more T.V. coverage
than the Kardashians.

20:36.743 --> 20:38.533
- [Narrator] Where's there's fire,

20:38.534 --> 20:42.701
there's Valentina bringing
down a bar and oh my God!

20:43.665 --> 20:46.852
Here comes that idiot Dick Strong.

20:46.853 --> 20:49.392
(mumbling)

20:49.393 --> 20:51.292
- Dick Strong, Channel Nine News.

20:51.293 --> 20:53.060
Valentina has claimed her first victim

20:53.061 --> 20:56.605
since her eviction, burning
down a local establishment.

20:56.606 --> 20:59.227
We'll keep you up to date
as this saga continues,

20:59.228 --> 21:01.990
however, do you think the fire department

21:01.991 --> 21:03.617
will ever show up?

21:03.618 --> 21:06.285
(alarm beeping)

21:11.573 --> 21:14.366
- [Woman] Dick, we are still live.

21:14.367 --> 21:15.367
- Whatever.

21:17.029 --> 21:19.779
(dramatic music)

21:32.658 --> 21:34.195
And we're back now.

21:34.196 --> 21:37.157
It appears that as the
movie and saga continues

21:37.158 --> 21:41.075
of the story of Valentina,
that the intricacies

21:42.308 --> 21:44.242
get deeper with the
character, and what we've

21:44.243 --> 21:45.768
finally found out is the Bad Actress

21:45.769 --> 21:48.505
came to America not for her own interest,

21:48.506 --> 21:51.110
but to help others and to save others

21:51.111 --> 21:52.524
and she ended up doing that.

21:52.525 --> 21:53.933
You know, most of you will see

21:53.934 --> 21:55.602
that she entered the contest,

21:55.603 --> 21:58.132
the Win a Part in a Movie Contest

21:58.133 --> 22:01.276
where the best actress
wins a million dollars,

22:01.277 --> 22:02.981
but we didn't know if
she would be the winner

22:02.982 --> 22:06.288
or who would be the
winner, but as the story

22:06.289 --> 22:09.127
went on, it started to work out for her

22:09.128 --> 22:11.561
because the end of the story

22:11.562 --> 22:14.619
is right up after these
commercial messages.

22:14.620 --> 22:16.183
- [Rosie Vajayjay] We're cut.

22:16.184 --> 22:18.909
Good Dick, you're pretty on fire.

22:18.910 --> 22:19.743
- Thanks so much.

22:19.743 --> 22:20.576
- [Rosie Vajayjay] It's so great,

22:20.577 --> 22:22.001
you're actually a good reporter.

22:22.002 --> 22:23.312
- Thank you so much.

22:23.313 --> 22:24.532
My dick is gettin' strong!

22:24.533 --> 22:26.268
- It's strong, very strong!

22:26.269 --> 22:29.040
- Alright, good, we're
ready for the next take.

22:29.041 --> 22:30.138
Ready?

22:30.139 --> 22:32.556
(soft music)

22:42.099 --> 22:45.932
(singing in foreign language)

24:00.904 --> 24:01.737
- [Valentina] Hi.

24:01.737 --> 24:02.570
- Hi, how are you?

24:02.570 --> 24:03.403
- Good.

24:03.404 --> 24:05.094
I want a mojito.

24:05.095 --> 24:06.107
- Absolutely.

24:06.108 --> 24:07.405
- [Valentina] Thank you.

24:07.406 --> 24:09.989
- [Barmaid] Give me one moment.

24:11.133 --> 24:12.800
Alright, here we go.

24:17.721 --> 24:19.320
- I need to put this in my drink because

24:19.321 --> 24:21.837
what if someone were to
poison Valentina, hmm?

24:21.838 --> 24:24.448
- I can put that on there
for you, no problem.

24:24.449 --> 24:25.449
- Yes, good.

24:27.808 --> 24:29.141
- There you are.

24:30.914 --> 24:31.914
Enjoy.

24:35.862 --> 24:37.083
- Loo loo loo.

24:37.084 --> 24:38.638
(chuckling)

24:38.639 --> 24:41.306
(calypso music)

25:21.601 --> 25:22.434
Hi.

25:22.435 --> 25:24.351
- Hi, how can I help you?

25:24.352 --> 25:27.122
- Well, I need an outfit for jungle.

25:27.123 --> 25:28.373
- [Clerk] Okay.

25:31.362 --> 25:33.195
- Can I have that one?

25:40.332 --> 25:41.332
Hi.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.992
Can I have the boots?

25:48.165 --> 25:49.462
Loo loo loo.

25:49.463 --> 25:52.181
- Wait a minute, you didn't pay me!

25:52.182 --> 25:53.182
Oh, crazy!

25:54.500 --> 25:56.657
- Valentina thinks she's
going back in the jungle,

25:56.658 --> 26:00.408
but my friends, things
aren't what they seem.

26:05.078 --> 26:09.245
The burning sea sand then
found its way to darkness

26:10.033 --> 26:13.996
and the lovely Valentina,
darkness isn't a friend.

26:13.997 --> 26:17.580
They are afraid to
watch what happens next.

26:18.617 --> 26:21.700
(uptempo beat music)

26:44.473 --> 26:45.473
- Hi.

26:46.381 --> 26:47.381
How are you?

26:48.636 --> 26:51.521
I need you, just, I was near the boat

26:51.522 --> 26:53.608
and I was trying to get to the town hall

26:53.609 --> 26:55.817
and so they left me behind,

26:55.818 --> 26:58.988
seems like everybody's gone, (mumbling).

26:58.989 --> 27:00.531
Hey!

27:00.532 --> 27:02.291
Are you paying attention to me?

27:02.292 --> 27:04.305
I just said hi.

27:04.306 --> 27:08.473
So, (mumbles) and so
I was telling you that

27:08.649 --> 27:10.899

28:28.884 --> 28:30.301
Everybody's gone!

28:35.895 --> 28:38.312
I'm here by myself in jungle.

28:40.365 --> 28:41.365
Oh my gosh.

28:46.589 --> 28:49.506

28:53.949 --> 28:56.095

28:56.096 --> 28:57.994
- Oh, what are you doing here?

28:57.995 --> 28:58.828
- Here?

28:58.829 --> 29:00.261
This is my island.

29:00.262 --> 29:02.355
- You missed the boat.

29:02.356 --> 29:03.356
- The boat!

29:04.253 --> 29:06.947
- Oh, what is your name?

29:06.948 --> 29:09.983
- I am Valentina, Bad Actress.

29:09.984 --> 29:11.110
Loo loo loo!

29:11.111 --> 29:13.741
- Oh, I gotta get security.

29:13.742 --> 29:14.575
Hello?

29:14.576 --> 29:16.126

- Yes.

29:39.180 --> 29:40.819
- The Dick, Dick Strong?

29:40.820 --> 29:43.824
He does not put my Bad
Actress on the T.V. anymore.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.028
How can I find my Bad Actress

29:45.029 --> 29:47.955
so I can put her in a Win
a Part in a Movie Contest?

29:47.956 --> 29:49.456
WTF, Channel Nine.

29:53.773 --> 29:56.373
- Darling, I know you.

29:56.374 --> 29:59.267
You're that win a part movie producer.

29:59.268 --> 30:01.473

Come in.

Martin, come in now.

31:02.249 --> 31:03.582

31:15.820 --> 31:17.941
- What are you...

31:17.942 --> 31:20.173
- I'm driving a red car.

31:20.174 --> 31:22.265
You gave me the key.

31:22.266 --> 31:23.148
- That's the wrong car.

31:23.149 --> 31:24.315
It's that one.

31:27.309 --> 31:28.756
- What's the difference?

31:28.757 --> 31:30.660
Both are red, loo loo loo.

31:30.661 --> 31:33.087

31:33.088 --> 31:36.595
- [Narrator] Valentina is
in her new stolen Ferrari

31:36.596 --> 31:39.351
and heads out on the
town with credit cards

31:39.352 --> 31:41.857
that someone left in the car.

31:41.858 --> 31:44.240
She's slaps deny in the face,

31:44.241 --> 31:46.888
takes what she can, when she can.

31:46.889 --> 31:50.109
Now, getting free isn't enough.

31:50.110 --> 31:54.017
What has America done
to our lovely Valentina

31:54.018 --> 31:56.018
to drive her to extreme.

32:04.660 --> 32:06.947
- I'm not gonna pay for this.

32:06.948 --> 32:09.781
My food has a cricket, oh my gosh!

32:11.295 --> 32:14.878
(mumbling) help me please.

32:17.180 --> 32:19.095
- Yes, ma'am?

32:19.096 --> 32:23.014
- Can you see there's
a cricket in my food.

32:23.015 --> 32:25.145
- I'd be happy to bring you
another one if you like.

32:25.146 --> 32:26.989
- No, no, no.

32:26.990 --> 32:29.157
I want ten meals for free.

32:33.019 --> 32:35.269
I'm Valentina, loo loo loo.

32:41.486 --> 32:44.236
(dramatic music)

32:58.506 --> 33:01.128
- And we're back now from
that special introductory

33:01.129 --> 33:03.284
break that used to be called commercials,

33:03.285 --> 33:05.391
but as this story goes on, the Bad Actress

33:05.392 --> 33:07.204
is anything but what you thought.

33:07.205 --> 33:09.066
After being evicted from her mansion,

33:09.067 --> 33:11.949
she burnt down a local establishment

33:11.950 --> 33:14.750
only to patronize different restaurants,

33:14.751 --> 33:17.742
put crickets in their
food, ten meals for free

33:17.743 --> 33:19.717
and different antics all over town

33:19.718 --> 33:21.317
and the Bad Actress ended up

33:21.318 --> 33:23.836
getting more coverage
than the Kardashians,

33:23.837 --> 33:25.664
but like I said earlier, there was

33:25.665 --> 33:27.871
a bigger story underneath and the story

33:27.872 --> 33:30.061
was completely different
than what we thought

33:30.062 --> 33:32.465
because the truth is, Bad Actress came

33:32.466 --> 33:35.215
to America for a completely
different reason.

33:35.216 --> 33:37.922
The reason is about to be untold

33:37.923 --> 33:40.896
right after these commercial messages.

33:40.897 --> 33:42.199
- [Rosie Vajayjay] And cut.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.265
That was great, Dick.

33:44.266 --> 33:45.430
- I'm doing better, huh?

33:45.431 --> 33:48.179
- Yeah, you're a rock star,
a crap rock star, that is.

33:48.180 --> 33:50.026
- Thanks so much.

33:50.027 --> 33:51.027
Alright.

33:52.116 --> 33:54.699

34:49.697 --> 34:52.530
- [Man] Would you like a cocktail?

34:54.460 --> 34:56.936
- Hey, would you like
to make that a double?

34:56.937 --> 34:59.520

35:22.284 --> 35:23.117

35:25.616 --> 35:26.449

35:27.282 --> 35:28.115
- What you do?

35:28.116 --> 35:30.053
- I have oil rigs in Mexico.

35:30.054 --> 35:30.887
- Really?

35:30.887 --> 35:31.720
- Yes.

35:31.721 --> 35:33.618
- Well, we should go out.

35:33.619 --> 35:36.691
As soon as I saw you, I knew
you were the one for me.

35:36.692 --> 35:37.692

36:41.361 --> 36:44.670
We find our Valentina figuring things out.

36:44.671 --> 36:47.532
She realized that she didn't lose anything

36:47.533 --> 36:49.494
and gained everything.

36:49.495 --> 36:51.611
Happens this isn't about money.

36:51.612 --> 36:53.787
It's about friends.

36:53.788 --> 36:54.788
Tata.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.487
I really can't believe
it's you here in America.

37:12.488 --> 37:15.813
So, tell me, what are you doing here?

37:15.814 --> 37:18.157
- I lost everything.

the Miami night life roars.

42:55.536 --> 42:59.368
All the stars in the heavens watch over us

42:59.369 --> 43:03.449
while lights roam streets and skyscrapers

43:03.450 --> 43:06.254
dancing in unison with the clouds

(melancholy music)

43:30.983 --> 43:33.650

44:13.648 --> 44:16.177
is about to take a nap.

44:16.178 --> 44:18.264
Who would think about her?

44:18.265 --> 44:21.418
After she had it all,
she has nowhere to go,

44:21.419 --> 44:23.005
no one to talk to.

44:23.006 --> 44:25.647
After she have everything, she has nothing

44:25.648 --> 44:28.155
to the point she has slept in a park.

This is a county park.

You're gonna have to leave.

Danny knows the way.

47:37.941 --> 47:40.158

47:40.159 --> 47:43.950
- Well, there is no
problem since I always get

47:43.951 --> 47:46.595

47:46.596 --> 47:50.763

48:06.873 --> 48:08.227

48:08.228 --> 48:09.852
Doesn't he have a migraine?

48:09.853 --> 48:11.617
- No, girl, Danny doesn't have a migraine.

48:11.618 --> 48:13.385
He just has a hangover.

48:13.386 --> 48:14.219
- How do you know?

48:14.220 --> 48:18.350
- Because he's gay and he

54:19.047 --> 54:22.021
How can that be name for grown man?

54:22.022 --> 54:24.098
In holy matrimony.

54:24.099 --> 54:26.681
If there's anybody here
who feels this wedding

54:26.682 --> 54:29.346
should not take place, let them speak now

54:29.347 --> 54:31.680
or forever hold their peace.

54:33.105 --> 54:34.105
All rise.

54:37.073 --> 54:38.073
All rise.

54:40.027 --> 54:42.309
- Hello, my friends.

54:42.310 --> 54:45.299
Finally Valentina gets her prince

54:45.300 --> 54:48.413
that she's been waiting
for her whole life.

54:48.414 --> 54:50.634
Let's see what happen.

54:50.635 --> 54:53.088
- Eh, there's something you should see

54:53.089 --> 54:55.006
over here on the floor.

54:55.861 --> 54:57.028
Over this way.

54:59.218 --> 55:03.385
Well now, you two, shut
up and empty your pockets!

55:03.618 --> 55:05.647
- This has got to be a joke.

55:05.648 --> 55:07.376
- No joke hee hee hee.

55:07.377 --> 55:08.710
- So you rob us?

55:09.882 --> 55:11.495
- Yes, that's what I'm doing

55:11.496 --> 55:13.563
and you have the ring, I believe?

55:13.564 --> 55:15.929
I'd like the ring, please.

55:15.930 --> 55:18.223
- I can't believe this.

55:18.224 --> 55:19.597
- Thank you very much.

55:19.598 --> 55:22.348
- I hope God punish you for this!

55:23.287 --> 55:25.620
- Yeah, maybe just a little.

55:27.943 --> 55:30.110
(buzzing)

55:34.289 --> 55:36.039
- Aaron, how are you?

55:38.383 --> 55:40.216
I'm just watching T.V.

55:42.662 --> 55:46.829
Thank you, but I told you, I
cannot go to Paris with you.

55:48.007 --> 55:51.407
Because I still love my husband

55:51.408 --> 55:55.575
and when Valentina
loves, she loves forever.

55:55.882 --> 55:57.632
Yes, that's so sweet.

55:59.101 --> 56:00.101
I know.

56:02.812 --> 56:04.735
What do you mean?

56:04.736 --> 56:05.736
They did?

56:06.534 --> 56:07.617
Oh, whatever.

56:09.924 --> 56:10.924
Bye.

56:24.421 --> 56:26.588
(buzzing)

56:30.726 --> 56:32.226
Aaron, I told you.

56:33.810 --> 56:34.810
Hotel?

56:37.130 --> 56:38.130
Again?

56:39.137 --> 56:40.137
Evicted?

56:42.838 --> 56:43.838
Me?

56:45.147 --> 56:46.147
No!

56:48.651 --> 56:50.818
Oh my gosh, no, not again.

56:52.940 --> 56:54.440
What I'm gonna do?

56:59.675 --> 57:02.425
(heels clacking)

57:05.349 --> 57:07.215
Skip, where are you going?

57:07.216 --> 57:09.625
You hardly stay home any more!

57:09.626 --> 57:10.866
- I told you.

57:10.867 --> 57:11.842
I have a work issue.

57:11.843 --> 57:13.455
- Issues every night?

57:13.456 --> 57:15.123
- This is so stupid.

57:16.025 --> 57:16.962
I don't wanna argue.

57:16.963 --> 57:18.032
- Excuse me?

57:18.033 --> 57:19.637
Are you seeing another woman?

57:19.638 --> 57:20.471
- No.

57:20.472 --> 57:21.583
How could you ask me that?

57:21.584 --> 57:23.424
- I don't know if I believe you.

57:23.425 --> 57:24.662
Maybe I should go.

57:24.663 --> 57:25.697
I'm not gonna stay with someone

57:25.698 --> 57:28.325
who doesn't even pay
attention to me anymore.

57:28.326 --> 57:29.429
- I do.

57:29.430 --> 57:31.023
Baby, please.

57:31.024 --> 57:33.333
You know there's no one else.

57:33.334 --> 57:35.427
Don't you believe me?

57:35.428 --> 57:37.678
I love you, but I gotta go.

57:42.308 --> 57:44.784
- You piece of crap.

57:44.785 --> 57:46.538
You cheat on me.

57:46.539 --> 57:50.160
I knew it and you think he was real.

57:50.161 --> 57:51.161
I hate you.

57:52.206 --> 57:53.206
I hate you.

57:55.062 --> 57:58.384
Since why she tried to
poison me in jungle.

57:58.385 --> 57:59.766
I knew it.

57:59.767 --> 58:01.173
I hate you.

58:01.174 --> 58:03.424
(thudding)

58:04.301 --> 58:05.801
I had a nightmare.

58:07.062 --> 58:09.812
(dramatic music)

58:24.081 --> 58:26.334
- Alright, we're back now from
these commercial messages.

58:26.335 --> 58:29.447
Now, when I first met Valentina, you know,

58:29.448 --> 58:31.701
I was totally a mess but you know,

58:31.702 --> 58:33.343
I found out through this story

58:33.344 --> 58:35.508
that I started to get better.

58:35.509 --> 58:38.688
I was falling apart in the
beginning but as the story

58:38.689 --> 58:41.986
went on, I got so much
better at my reporting.

58:41.987 --> 58:45.478
I started to become a
professional because I found out

58:45.479 --> 58:48.878
that the Bad Actress, it wasn't about her,

58:48.879 --> 58:50.423
it was all about others.

58:50.424 --> 58:52.341
She seemed like she was
only in it for herself,

58:52.342 --> 58:54.655
to help herself, but she was always there

58:54.656 --> 58:57.422
to help others and what we found out is

58:57.423 --> 59:01.236
that with the Bad Actress,
she was coming to America

59:01.237 --> 59:04.068
to bring something great
back to where you came from

59:04.069 --> 59:06.304
because you gotta realize, she came from

59:06.305 --> 59:10.472
a small village in South
America and it wasn't easy

59:10.897 --> 59:14.220
and as things went on, it really started

59:14.221 --> 59:18.040
to work out because Bad
Actress, you get it.

59:18.041 --> 59:22.208
She, I'll tell you right after
these commercial messages.

59:22.874 --> 59:24.856
- [Rosie Vajayjay] And cut.

59:24.857 --> 59:27.009
You might actually get laid tonight.

59:27.010 --> 59:28.719
- Thanks, I need some action.

59:28.720 --> 59:30.056
- [Rosie Vajayjay] Yeah.

59:30.057 --> 59:32.289
- Okay, good, I think we're

59:32.290 --> 59:34.133
bringing it on, now, right Rosie?

59:34.134 --> 59:35.563
Gimme some of that Vajayjay.

59:35.564 --> 59:37.167
Okay, here we go baby.

59:37.168 --> 59:40.251
(uptempo beat music)

59:48.407 --> 59:50.961
- Please, please, no
pictures, stop flashing.

59:50.962 --> 59:53.027
- [Man] Jean-Pierre, Access Tonight.

59:53.028 --> 59:55.563
We really wanna know who you chose

59:55.564 --> 59:56.965
to actually win the million dollars

59:56.966 --> 59:58.398
for your Win a Part in a Movie Contest.

59:58.399 --> 01:00:00.810
- Please, please, I have no comment.

01:00:00.811 --> 01:00:03.007
You'll all know in due time.

01:00:03.008 --> 01:00:05.340
Everybody wants to know who will be

01:00:05.341 --> 01:00:07.657
Jean-Pierre's next big star.

01:00:07.658 --> 01:00:09.907
Associated Press, Entertainment Tonight,

01:00:09.908 --> 01:00:12.825
Access, TMZ, Deco Drive, everybody,

01:00:14.136 --> 01:00:16.269
so please, do not ask me again

01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:19.613
but don't worry, you will
all know in due time.

01:00:19.614 --> 01:00:22.281
(uptempo music)

01:00:27.996 --> 01:00:29.070
Hi Zoe.

01:00:29.071 --> 01:00:31.337
I was wondering if the
Bad Actress has come by

01:00:31.338 --> 01:00:34.096
to enter in the Win a
Part in a Movie Contest?

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:37.412
I have not heard from her, and
I'm trying to track her down.

01:00:37.413 --> 01:00:38.381
- Bad what?

01:00:38.382 --> 01:00:40.138
- Bad actress.

01:00:40.139 --> 01:00:41.708
Don't you have the news?

01:00:41.709 --> 01:00:43.147
Don't you have the hearing?

01:00:43.148 --> 01:00:44.714
Don't you have the problem?

01:00:44.715 --> 01:00:46.569
But of course you do, you're American.

01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:49.025
Say it, Bad Actress.

01:00:49.026 --> 01:00:50.488
- Listen, Pepe LePew, I don't know

01:00:50.489 --> 01:00:53.489
what your problem is, but
no Bad Actress came in.

01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:55.268
- Track her down, vamoose.

01:00:55.269 --> 01:00:58.672
- Yeah, I'll totally track her down.

01:00:58.673 --> 01:01:00.959
Bad actress is just so dumb.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.627
(uptempo music)

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:10.571
- Valentina needs shoes.

01:01:10.572 --> 01:01:14.384
My husband, Skip, used to buy me shoes.

01:01:14.385 --> 01:01:16.747
- (mumbling) to Skip?

01:01:16.748 --> 01:01:18.559
- No, he skipped town.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.560
- Oh, let's go shopping.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.467
- That'll be $3,000.

01:01:28.979 --> 01:01:29.979
- Okay.

01:01:31.048 --> 01:01:32.048
Tree.

01:01:33.722 --> 01:01:34.722
Sand

01:01:35.621 --> 01:01:36.621
dollars.

01:01:41.234 --> 01:01:43.651
(beat music)

01:01:46.913 --> 01:01:48.741
- [Narrator] Valentina
has been dreaming of

01:01:48.742 --> 01:01:51.596
movie premieres, red carpets,

01:01:51.597 --> 01:01:55.328
crowds of adoring fans her whole life.

01:01:55.329 --> 01:01:59.496
Now it looks that dream
has finally come true.

01:01:59.965 --> 01:02:02.382
(beat music)

01:02:11.524 --> 01:02:14.390
- Have a main role, however,
this is my movie, too,

01:02:14.391 --> 01:02:16.427
because you guys, you are my people

01:02:16.428 --> 01:02:19.373
and I love you all and
I love The Movie Studio

01:02:19.374 --> 01:02:22.190
so thank you for the opportunity

01:02:22.191 --> 01:02:24.748
that you have given me and congratulations

01:02:24.749 --> 01:02:26.249
about your movies.

01:02:27.566 --> 01:02:28.844
- Your movies.

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:30.653
(laughing)

01:02:30.654 --> 01:02:32.597
Okay, I wanna ask you one more thing.

01:02:32.598 --> 01:02:36.348
Being the actress playing
such a strong role,

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.511
what obstacles did you encounter

01:02:39.512 --> 01:02:42.044
getting into character?

01:02:42.045 --> 01:02:45.410
- God, it's so easy for me
to do what I do, really,

01:02:45.411 --> 01:02:48.694
and I enjoy so much
because it's in my blood

01:02:48.695 --> 01:02:52.272
and my body and my head and my heart

01:02:52.273 --> 01:02:55.708
so I would say that I enjoy so much

01:02:55.709 --> 01:02:58.155
that I do not feel that I'm working.

01:02:58.156 --> 01:03:01.406
It's just that it's so fun and so nice,

01:03:02.267 --> 01:03:04.482
and I really appreciate
everybody out there

01:03:04.483 --> 01:03:07.822
that watch our movies and my English

01:03:07.823 --> 01:03:08.656
is a little bit...

01:03:08.656 --> 01:03:09.489
- [Interviewer] It's beautiful.

01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:11.500
- Not that good, I feel so bad.

01:03:11.501 --> 01:03:14.893
You know that I just came
back from Cannes Festival

01:03:14.894 --> 01:03:19.061
in Nice in France and we
had a wonderful time there

01:03:20.171 --> 01:03:22.214
doing a red carpet for our movie,

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:24.434
so I'm very excited about this year.

01:03:24.435 --> 01:03:28.410
Before this year and I
think we have to celebrate

01:03:28.411 --> 01:03:31.407
with God especially, with
energy and with everybody

01:03:31.408 --> 01:03:34.261
at The Movie Studio, so thank you so much.

01:03:34.262 --> 01:03:37.263
(uptempo beat music)

01:03:37.264 --> 01:03:40.014
(dramatic music)

01:03:53.237 --> 01:03:55.247
- Alright, we're back from
these commercial messages.

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:58.124
Now, we're finding out
that the Bad Actress,

01:03:58.125 --> 01:04:00.470
as I told you, had a surprise in store,

01:04:00.471 --> 01:04:01.846
and the surprise is this.

01:04:01.847 --> 01:04:03.684
She wasn't really a Bad Actress.

01:04:03.685 --> 01:04:05.578
She was the best actress.

01:04:05.579 --> 01:04:08.755
You're right, she won
the Best Actress award,

01:04:08.756 --> 01:04:10.720
the million dollar check and you know what

01:04:10.721 --> 01:04:12.668
she did with that, ladies and gentlemen?

01:04:12.669 --> 01:04:14.326
It wasn't for her.

01:04:14.327 --> 01:04:16.001
She didn't even keep the money.

01:04:16.002 --> 01:04:18.070
She brought it back to South America

01:04:18.071 --> 01:04:20.093
and she gave it to the Columbian School

01:04:20.094 --> 01:04:22.144
of Homeless Girls, that's right.

01:04:22.145 --> 01:04:25.109
After all her suffering,
after all her tragedy,

01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:28.193
she got better by giving it all away.

01:04:30.414 --> 01:04:32.664
(cheering)

01:04:46.094 --> 01:04:48.844
(dramatic music)

01:05:02.225 --> 01:05:04.690
Dick Strong, Channel Nine News reporting.

01:05:04.691 --> 01:05:07.213
Eye on Valentina, special report.

01:05:07.214 --> 01:05:09.182
As you've seen earlier in this segment

01:05:09.183 --> 01:05:11.658
this evening, this is
a human interest story,

01:05:11.659 --> 01:05:13.803
not just a special event story.

01:05:13.804 --> 01:05:15.623
It's not if it bleeds, it leads.

01:05:15.624 --> 01:05:18.201
The story Bad Actress is so much more,

01:05:18.202 --> 01:05:20.495
because in the end, the Bad Actress

01:05:20.496 --> 01:05:22.544
didn't just change so many lives,

01:05:22.545 --> 01:05:24.678
she changed my life, as well.

01:05:24.679 --> 01:05:26.677
She taught me I could be a better man,

01:05:26.678 --> 01:05:29.325
that if you love and care about others,

01:05:29.326 --> 01:05:31.682
you can make a difference in this world,

01:05:31.683 --> 01:05:33.661
because the thing with the Bad Actress,

01:05:33.662 --> 01:05:36.475
it made her the best
actress and she taught us

01:05:36.476 --> 01:05:38.818
the most one important thing in life

01:05:38.819 --> 01:05:42.060
is not what you have, it's who you are

01:05:42.061 --> 01:05:44.898
and if who are gives to
others more than what

01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:49.066
you get in return, that
message could change the world

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.389
one person at a time and you probably
