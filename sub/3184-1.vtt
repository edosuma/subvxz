01:24.750 --> 01:28.354
Is my cock exquisite?

01:35.042 --> 01:38.396
Oh, cos I think it's
fucking exquisite.

01:40.292 --> 01:44.351
I think it's a fucking work of art.

01:45.083 --> 01:47.686
Like a Renoir.

01:47.750 --> 01:50.148
Or a Picasso.

01:52.042 --> 01:57.148
The painting of my cock
should hang at the Louvre.

01:57.625 --> 02:00.457
They should study my
cock in art classes,

02:00.458 --> 02:02.435
spend whole courses...

02:02.458 --> 02:06.563
studying the splendid contours of
its exquisiteness, don't you think?

02:08.167 --> 02:11.624
They should also study
my cock in science class

02:11.625 --> 02:14.228
cos it defies nature.

02:15.167 --> 02:16.860
My cock is hard.

02:16.875 --> 02:20.332
It's metal, it's steel,
it's titanium.

02:20.333 --> 02:22.874
It does not break.
It does not weaken.

02:22.875 --> 02:25.444
My cock can stand all day

02:25.458 --> 02:29.768
like a good soldier trying
to impress his superiors.

02:29.833 --> 02:33.142
If my cock could win
a medal, it would.

02:33.167 --> 02:36.771
If they could name a school
after it, it should.

02:36.792 --> 02:40.271
If it could save small Somali
children from starving,

02:40.333 --> 02:44.166
it would and should, and it'll have
a Nobel fucking Peace Prize for it,

02:44.167 --> 02:47.350
the first such prize
ever given to a cock.

02:47.375 --> 02:52.561
My Nobel Prize-winning
cook's like a cheetah,

02:52.583 --> 02:55.874
all sleek and dangerous and deadly.

02:55.875 --> 03:00.276
Sonnets should be written about
how dangerous my cheetah cock is.

03:00.292 --> 03:01.564
Poems, plays.

03:01.583 --> 03:05.859
Wars should be won over it,
kingdoms fallen because of it.

03:05.875 --> 03:08.374
My cock is lightning. It is fire.

03:08.375 --> 03:14.153
It is a volcano brewing with
the sacred semen, lava...

03:16.375 --> 03:18.666
Sugar and spice and all things...

03:20.667 --> 03:22.485
nice.

03:22.625 --> 03:24.398
Sorry for the lack
of warning, dearie.

03:27.542 --> 03:29.457
Things happen.

03:29.458 --> 03:33.062
Sometimes you expect 'em,
sometimes you don't.

03:43.667 --> 03:47.291
I said, "Give me 200 quid, I'll light
my fag off two fucking fireworks."

03:47.292 --> 03:49.352
- Dickie nips off round the corner...
- Hemingway.

03:50.417 --> 03:51.666
I'm eating my pudding.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.291
I couldn't give a toss
about your pudding.

03:53.292 --> 03:54.894
Put your fork down
and get over 'ere.

03:55.083 --> 03:57.606
I'll put my fork down when I'm
ready to put my fork down.

03:57.625 --> 04:00.194
I'll finish my pudding when I'm
ready to finish my pudding.

04:00.208 --> 04:02.356
You wanna disrespect
me, disrespect me.

04:02.458 --> 04:04.777
But then I won't be able
to tell you what I know.

04:05.042 --> 04:07.041
And I know you'd like
to know what I know.

04:07.042 --> 04:09.291
- What would I like to know?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

04:09.292 --> 04:11.190
- I would like to know.
- Yeah, you would, wouldn't ya?

04:11.208 --> 04:12.730
- Tell me.
- Fork.

04:13.208 --> 04:14.730
Fuck.

04:16.291 --> 04:18.861
Oh, for Christ's sake, Dom,
just put the fork down.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.310
Tell me what it is
you have to tell me.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.693
Call came in.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.082
Call?

04:35.083 --> 04:36.184
The call.

04:38.500 --> 04:39.852
The call?

04:40.042 --> 04:41.359
Came in.

05:19.125 --> 05:23.810
Dom! Dom! Dom! Dom!

06:09.708 --> 06:11.749
Oi! Where's Sandy Butterfield?

06:11.750 --> 06:14.166
- Dom? Dom, is that you?
- Where's Sandy Butterfield?

06:14.167 --> 06:15.666
Dom, you really don't wanna...

06:15.667 --> 06:17.610
Where's Sandy Butterfield?

06:18.625 --> 06:19.772
Where?

06:20.417 --> 06:22.485
He's still working at the depot.

06:37.750 --> 06:41.104
- Hey, where are you going?
- Where's Sandy Butterfield?

06:41.125 --> 06:44.104
- Sir, I...
- Where's Sandy Butterfield?

07:04.667 --> 07:06.064
Sandy.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.986
So that's what you do, is it, mate?

07:20.042 --> 07:22.895
You fuck other men's wives
while they're in prison.

07:22.958 --> 07:24.685
That's what you do with yourself,

07:24.708 --> 07:27.457
how you conduct yourself, how
you conduct your business.

07:27.458 --> 07:30.482
- I don't know...
- She was my wife. My wife!

07:30.542 --> 07:33.942
- You were divorced and in jail!
- She was still my wife.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.082
Always my wife, you fuck.

07:36.083 --> 07:38.777
You fucker! My betrothed.

07:38.833 --> 07:42.707
You're nothing but a pestilence, an
uphill gardener with a weak chin.

07:42.708 --> 07:44.374
You're a filthafising thief,

07:44.375 --> 07:46.569
that's what you are. You
think you can steal from me?

07:46.750 --> 07:49.374
- From me? From Dom Hemingway?
- God...

07:49.375 --> 07:52.228
God!

08:25.833 --> 08:27.401
Hello, Billy.

08:28.167 --> 08:29.393
Andrew.

08:29.667 --> 08:32.645
Hello, Dom. Long time.

08:34.042 --> 08:35.143
Welcome home.

08:35.832 --> 08:37.559
Thanks.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.291
You good? Betty good?

08:39.292 --> 08:40.393
Yeah.

08:40.707 --> 08:43.402
Charlie just graduated university.

08:44.292 --> 08:47.817
Little Charlie with his hair all growing
in his eyes graduated university?

08:48.292 --> 08:50.440
Can you believe it?

08:57.875 --> 09:00.774
I should fucking kill you,

09:01.000 --> 09:02.977
but I fancy a pint instead.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.811
I've got anger issues,
Dickie, I just do.

09:13.125 --> 09:14.442
Always have, haven't I?

09:14.833 --> 09:18.483
I tried to work on 'em, you know,
in prison. Took some classes.

09:18.833 --> 09:22.642
I tried the yoga, inspirational
CDs, I did it all.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.318
But the anger's still inside of me.

09:26.625 --> 09:28.523
I just lost it, I guess.

09:28.792 --> 09:31.975
He married Keethy.
What's a man to do?

09:32.500 --> 09:34.523
Well, I broke his fucking nose.

09:34.625 --> 09:36.443
He wasn't so good-looking
to start with.

09:38.292 --> 09:39.457
He wet himself.

09:39.458 --> 09:40.582
He had it coming.

09:40.583 --> 09:42.105
Still...

09:44.000 --> 09:46.944
Er, sorry, Dom, you
can't smoke in here.

09:48.458 --> 09:51.812
- You what?
- They banned it, smoking.

09:52.542 --> 09:55.666
In a pub? You can't
smoke in a fucking pub?

09:55.667 --> 09:56.859
Bad for your health.

09:56.875 --> 09:59.791
Being a cunt is bad for your
health, I'm just smoking a fag.

09:59.792 --> 10:01.986
Got one for me while you're at it?

10:19.917 --> 10:21.858
He's expecting you
in France, you know,

10:21.958 --> 10:23.480
Mr Fontaine.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.935
He knows what you did for him.

10:27.667 --> 10:30.457
Mr Fontaine's a man who
doesn't forget his friends.

10:30.458 --> 10:33.107
- I'm his friend now?
- You did right by him.

10:33.208 --> 10:34.916
You'll get your due.

10:34.917 --> 10:36.916
12 years, Dickie.

10:36.917 --> 10:38.610
12 years of my life.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.853
I missed a lot doing right by him.

10:43.583 --> 10:45.651
Missed Keethy's funeral.

10:45.750 --> 10:48.228
Missed out on my
Evelyn's childhood.

10:48.667 --> 10:50.565
My daughter.

10:57.083 --> 10:58.423
You got to see her yet?

11:00.417 --> 11:02.315
I'm working up the marbles.

11:02.458 --> 11:04.457
You've had 12 years to
work up the marbles...

11:04.458 --> 11:07.892
I just made Bolognese out
of her stepfather's face.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.568
As if she didn't hate me enough.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.319
Mr Fontaine, he
bought them for you.

11:17.333 --> 11:20.403
A little welcome-home present,
if you're interested.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.986
- For me?
- For you.

11:40.167 --> 11:43.066
Oh, I love this fucking song!

11:45.458 --> 11:47.499
You hear that, Dickie?

11:47.500 --> 11:50.124
- Yeah, Dom.
- You hear that? You know what that is?

11:50.125 --> 11:51.416
What, Dom? What is it?

11:51.417 --> 11:53.940
That's the sound of
fucking freedom!

11:54.167 --> 11:55.707
Innit, Jeanie, eh?

11:55.708 --> 11:57.624
Oh, my love! Innit?

12:02.625 --> 12:04.523
Hello, ladies.

12:06.167 --> 12:08.361
- Whoa!
- Come on, then.

12:11.542 --> 12:14.020
No one call me for three days.

12:27.667 --> 12:31.271
Oh, my head's throbbing.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.440
It's fucking throbbing, Dickie.

12:34.833 --> 12:37.791
Like a disco in my head.
Like a fucking Manila disco

12:37.792 --> 12:40.975
full of transvestites
and suckling pigs.

12:41.333 --> 12:43.582
I've got a seizure in my brain.

12:43.583 --> 12:47.563
A diabolical seizure of
fucking and sucking coke.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.443
I did too much.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.649
I tried to make up for
too much lost time.

12:53.167 --> 12:55.110
I fucked myself to death.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.644
My head's gonna explode.

12:57.708 --> 13:00.687
Bits of my brain's
gonna go everywhere.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.457
I'm gonna ruin your blazer.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.207
You're gonna be all right, Dom.

13:04.208 --> 13:05.832
Fuck you. You don't know my head.

13:05.833 --> 13:08.457
You don't know the
revolution going on...

13:08.458 --> 13:09.957
inside of it.

13:09.958 --> 13:13.107
Fucking insurgents inside my brain.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.771
Cossacks sodomising my cranium.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.398
- Here.
- What's that? A hand grenade?

13:19.500 --> 13:22.809
- Hair of the dog.
- That dog shat on my soul.

13:23.167 --> 13:25.082
Drink it. It's mother's
little helper.

13:25.083 --> 13:27.902
My mother left me when I was
three. Fuck my mother.

13:32.625 --> 13:33.851
Oh...

13:38.875 --> 13:40.943
Fuck, I'm dying.

13:41.375 --> 13:43.898
I'm dying. I'm gonna
die on this train.

13:43.958 --> 13:46.902
If dying on this train will
shut you up, I'm all for it.

13:47.042 --> 13:49.270
Some fucking friend you are.

13:50.958 --> 13:54.332
You can't make up for 12
years in three days, Dom.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.060
Well, I tried.

14:01.583 --> 14:04.357
I fucking tried.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.397
Mr Hemingway?

14:21.792 --> 14:23.249
Mr Dom Hemingway?

14:23.250 --> 14:24.351
What?

14:24.417 --> 14:27.521
I've been sent by Monsieur
Fontaine. Follow me.

14:28.250 --> 14:29.351
Oi, lardo!

14:29.750 --> 14:32.820
If you're sent by Mr Fontaine,
then carry my fucking bag.

14:34.458 --> 14:37.061
Someone's feeling
his old self again.

14:37.667 --> 14:40.976
Damn right. Now let's go
get my fucking money.

14:50.542 --> 14:53.270
It's interesting, the
French countryside.

14:53.708 --> 14:57.017
Looks like a barmaid's snatch
after a Cup Final weekend.

15:01.292 --> 15:04.111
Fontaine better have
a well-stocked bar.

15:04.167 --> 15:07.874
He was raised in a Russian orphanage
and kills people for a living.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.649
Of course he has a
well-stocked bar.

15:40.458 --> 15:42.435
South of France.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.269
Afternoon.

16:09.458 --> 16:11.560
Dom, don't think what
you're thinking.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.777
That's Mr Fontaine's property.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.457
Property is a relative
term for a thief.

16:16.458 --> 16:19.061
- Still.
- I'm just looking.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.067
Admiring.

16:22.250 --> 16:24.624
- She's rather fit.
- Not her, not Paolina.

16:24.625 --> 16:27.228
- Fit to fiddle, I'd say.
- Dom!

16:27.625 --> 16:29.749
- You don't admire that.
- Bugger off, Dickie.

16:29.750 --> 16:33.434
I'll admire what I wanna admire,
think what I wanna think.

16:35.667 --> 16:38.316
Fiddle who I wanna fiddle.

16:42.958 --> 16:45.902
Domingo Hemingway!

16:46.833 --> 16:49.356
As I live and breathe,

16:49.625 --> 16:52.695
the Ghost of Christmas Past.

16:52.917 --> 16:54.610
Mr Fontaine.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.916
Call me Ivan. Are you crazy?

16:56.917 --> 16:59.666
Ivan Anatolivich Fontanov,
like the old days.

16:59.667 --> 17:03.397
I never called you Ivan
Anatoli in the old days.

17:03.792 --> 17:06.190
Well, you will now.

17:08.833 --> 17:10.560
Do you hunt, Dom?

17:10.916 --> 17:12.940
No, I don't, Ivan.

17:13.583 --> 17:15.624
I only use a gun to
hold up a place,

17:15.625 --> 17:18.694
or threaten someone, or rob 'em,

17:19.250 --> 17:21.207
or pistol-whip 'em, or scare 'em.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.606
- But, no, no hunting.
- Shame.

17:23.833 --> 17:26.106
It is the sport of princes.

17:26.416 --> 17:28.770
Well, I'm a peasant at heart.

17:28.958 --> 17:34.019
A petty serf with nice
hair and a strong liver.

17:37.250 --> 17:40.479
I'll eat what you hunt,
unless it's rabbit.

17:40.583 --> 17:42.560
Rabbits are pets. I don't eat pets.

17:42.625 --> 17:45.249
Oh, these French rabbits are
something else, though, Dom.

17:45.250 --> 17:46.624
I think you'll like 'em.

17:46.625 --> 17:48.443
They taste like a revolution.

17:48.792 --> 17:50.894
If that's an advert,
I'm not sure it's working.

17:52.958 --> 17:54.776
It's good to see you, Dom.

18:01.708 --> 18:03.105
Dom Hemingway is free!

18:03.542 --> 18:05.749
Dom Hemingway is free!

18:07.042 --> 18:09.691
Dom Hemingway is free!

18:28.083 --> 18:30.277
You look good, Dom, you really do.

18:31.417 --> 18:33.749
Well, what can I say?
I'm an handsome fucker.

18:37.292 --> 18:41.351
I see you've retained your vanity
and your sense of humour.

18:42.375 --> 18:44.148
Lefty was right.

18:45.042 --> 18:48.316
- Lefty?
- Yeah, Lefty, he was right.

18:49.958 --> 18:52.060
- Who's Lefty?
- Who's Lefty?

18:52.583 --> 18:54.356
You serious, Dom?

18:54.750 --> 18:56.227
You blind?

18:56.500 --> 18:58.193
You lost your eyesight in prison?

18:58.500 --> 18:59.582
What?

18:59.583 --> 19:03.438
Lefty! Lefty, your best friend,
Dickie, with one fucking hand.

19:06.333 --> 19:07.559
You lost your hand?

19:08.750 --> 19:10.147
Yeah, 'course.

19:10.542 --> 19:12.110
You lost your bloody hand?

19:12.833 --> 19:14.105
Yes, Dom.

19:14.292 --> 19:16.736
Why do you think I'm wearing
this black glove all the time?

19:17.417 --> 19:19.477
I thought it was a fashion
statement or something.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.317
Fashion statement?

19:22.458 --> 19:24.957
I've been in fucking prison
12 years. I missed a few things.

19:24.958 --> 19:27.060
I thought it was the latest
fashion. I don't know!

19:27.167 --> 19:30.942
You always were a bit of a clothes fag.
You lost your fucking hand?

19:31.542 --> 19:34.521
It was shot off three
years ago during a job.

19:34.958 --> 19:36.374
How do I not know that?

19:36.375 --> 19:39.354
They found his fingers strewn
all over the high street.

19:40.125 --> 19:42.023
Fucking hell, Dickie. I'm sorry.

19:42.625 --> 19:44.791
I'm good, Dom. It's all good.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.816
Yeah, Dickie's a good soldier.

19:47.833 --> 19:49.935
Mmm, tough guy.

19:51.083 --> 19:52.856
Stand-up man.

19:53.917 --> 19:55.564
So are you, Dom.

19:55.917 --> 19:58.019
The most stand-up man
I have ever met.

20:00.208 --> 20:01.810
- Dom is that.
- Yeah.

20:02.125 --> 20:04.899
Well, a rat is a rat
and a teat is a tit.

20:05.292 --> 20:08.362
Still, others would have broken.

20:08.917 --> 20:12.082
Those are others,
not Dom Hemingway.

20:12.083 --> 20:14.811
- No, not you.
- Not me.

20:24.750 --> 20:28.559
You've done all right for yourself
the last 12 years, Mr Fontaine.

20:28.667 --> 20:30.360
Ivan, please.

20:30.458 --> 20:33.437
Ivan. You've done all
right for yourself.

20:34.250 --> 20:37.433
The art, the house.

20:37.917 --> 20:41.957
Or estate. This is an estate, right?
That's what they call it. It's very nice.

20:41.958 --> 20:44.561
It's a villa, Dom, a holiday home.

20:45.167 --> 20:47.770
But thank you, thank you.
I appreciate it.

20:50.167 --> 20:52.645
Is Ivan short for Ivana?

20:56.125 --> 20:59.149
No, just Ivan.

21:00.708 --> 21:02.526
Could be Ivana, though, right?

21:03.958 --> 21:07.642
It's Ivan, Ivan
Anatolivich Fontanov.

21:09.167 --> 21:13.272
Ivan, sorry. Ivan. Sorry.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.147
It's OK.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.935
I could have ratted.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.318
I could have mentioned your name.

21:20.333 --> 21:24.374
I could have said Ivana Anatoli
Fontaine was the leader of the group.

21:24.375 --> 21:26.666
Maybe you are tired
from your trip, Dom?

21:26.667 --> 21:29.749
I kept my mouth shut and
I sat in that tiny cell

21:29.750 --> 21:33.229
while my wife died of cancer in the
arms of some other fucking bloke.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.318
I've heard about
that and I'm sorry.

21:35.958 --> 21:37.541
- Sorry?
- I'm sorry.

21:37.542 --> 21:38.957
- Try 12 years.
- I'm sorry, Dom...

21:38.958 --> 21:41.332
12 fucking years. Missed
my Evelyn growing up.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.435
I said I'm sorry.

21:43.542 --> 21:46.249
- Words are easy.
- And it's all I have.

21:46.250 --> 21:49.103
- You have something else.
- You are due and you will be paid.

21:49.333 --> 21:51.041
- Plus interest.
- Plus interest.

21:51.042 --> 21:52.815
Plus a present.

21:53.542 --> 21:55.736
- Present?
- For being so quiet.

21:56.083 --> 21:59.124
Those girls were a present.
Did you like them, Dom, huh'?

21:59.125 --> 22:00.874
The coke and the girls,
that was a present.

22:00.875 --> 22:05.526
Oh, you really think two birds and a
bit of blow are a worthy present?

22:06.042 --> 22:08.207
- After what I done for you?
- I was not suggesting...

22:08.208 --> 22:10.791
Cos that don't even come close
to a present, not even close.

22:10.792 --> 22:13.791
It's not even a stocking stuffer,
barely an opening act.

22:13.792 --> 22:16.975
Barely a fucking appetiser,
barely an <i>amuse-bouche.</i>

22:17.083 --> 22:20.999
It's nothing. It's nothing but a bit
of confetti in my ticker-tape parade,

22:21.000 --> 22:23.874
and I want the full fucking parade.

22:23.875 --> 22:26.166
My ticker-tape parade, Ivana.

22:26.167 --> 22:28.999
I want the fucking band.
I want the fucking float.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.666
I want the parade, the float,
the band and what you owe me.

22:31.667 --> 22:35.476
What you owe me
is what I fucking want!

22:37.083 --> 22:40.107
I said, you'll get what is yours.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.440
Plus a fucking present!

22:43.042 --> 22:44.874
- A real present.
- OK, Dom...

22:44.875 --> 22:47.194
Let's say, your girlfriend.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.740
The one with the bicycle.
What's her name?

22:51.875 --> 22:54.124
Paolina? I want her.

22:54.125 --> 22:56.124
Don't be crazy, Dom.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.582
I'm not crazy.

23:01.583 --> 23:04.166
I want her, naked,
like she likes it,

23:04.167 --> 23:05.707
with a little red
bow on her clitoris

23:05.708 --> 23:08.832
- for me to untie with my teeth.
- Enough. The joke is over.

23:08.833 --> 23:10.999
- I think you should sober up, OK?
- Joke's on you, Ivana.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.525
- Go rest. We'll see you at dinner.
- Ivana Anal-toli.

23:19.542 --> 23:22.166
I have been nothing but polite.

23:22.167 --> 23:25.291
Polite? Polite! Aren't
you the bee's knees?

23:25.292 --> 23:26.484
Cunt.

23:26.958 --> 23:28.401
Fucker.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.817
Cunt.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.353
You don't want me to get rough.

23:41.417 --> 23:42.541
Trust me, don't go there.

23:42.542 --> 23:44.394
Don't presuppose to
know what I want.

23:44.583 --> 23:46.749
You don't threaten me,
not with that girl's name.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.791
Not with that little
girl's name, Ivana.

23:48.792 --> 23:51.999
Ivana. Ivana? Ivana?
You don't scare me.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.523
You don't fucking
scare me, Anal-toli.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.811
I've seen death. I've seen evil.

23:56.958 --> 23:58.874
I've seen fire. I've seen rain.

23:58.875 --> 24:00.957
I've seen lonely days
I thought would never end.

24:00.958 --> 24:02.582
You don't fucking scare me.

24:02.583 --> 24:05.874
I eye-fuck you. I throat-fuck you!

24:05.875 --> 24:07.582
- Dom!
- Shut it, Dickie!

24:07.583 --> 24:11.438
You one-armed fuck. You freak.
You one-armed fucking fuck freak!

24:11.500 --> 24:15.480
No one's talking to you! No
one's ever talking to you!

24:36.708 --> 24:38.355
I'm fucking bored.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.568
I'm fucking drunk.

24:44.875 --> 24:47.694
I'm fucking drunk and
I'm fucking bored.

24:48.917 --> 24:51.611
I said what I wanted to say.
I said it and you heard it.

24:52.333 --> 24:53.855
Now I'm gonna take a nap.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.398
I'll see you wanks at dinner.

25:02.500 --> 25:05.228
And no fucking rabbit.

25:26.375 --> 25:27.897
Dom, you up?

25:31.042 --> 25:32.143
It's 6:30, it's dinner.

25:35.125 --> 25:36.727
Dom, mate!

25:42.500 --> 25:44.022
Dom?

25:53.625 --> 25:55.853
Jesus Christ.

25:59.875 --> 26:02.398
Dom! Dom!

26:02.750 --> 26:05.041
- Dom, are you fucking mad?
- I screwed it up, Dickie.

26:05.042 --> 26:06.291
I screwed everything up.

26:06.292 --> 26:09.111
Really? Cos I thought you
were just mentally retarded.

26:09.167 --> 26:11.124
Like those boys with the
bowl cuts on the telethons.

26:11.125 --> 26:13.541
- Dickie, I'm a mess. Look at me.
- I'm trying not to.

26:13.542 --> 26:17.416
I'm pathetic, I don't belong here.
I'm a monster. I'm a dinosaur.

26:17.417 --> 26:20.374
- Don't forget nudist, Dom. Don't forget that!
- I ought to be thrown away.

26:20.375 --> 26:23.374
Sent to a leper colony, forgotten
about, left to rot with the maggots.

26:23.375 --> 26:25.582
Jesus, Dom, you've got to
get control of yourself.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.481
You've got to beg
forgiveness of him.

26:27.708 --> 26:30.982
- You've got to put on trousers.
- I've been locked up for so long, Dickie.

26:31.250 --> 26:33.374
I see the light, the air.

26:33.375 --> 26:36.041
It's been so long since
I breathed clean air.

26:36.042 --> 26:37.374
I look at the clouds, I go nuts.

26:37.375 --> 26:40.604
You mix in the whisky, you mix
in the pussy, I go crazy.

26:40.708 --> 26:42.916
I'm a crazy man.
I'm a fucking nutter!

26:42.917 --> 26:45.332
- I mean, I'm afraid to see my own daughter.
- Really?

26:45.333 --> 26:48.357
But not too afraid to insult one of
the most dangerous men in Europe.

26:48.375 --> 26:51.604
Unfortunately, you had
the brass for that one.

26:57.250 --> 27:00.624
He's gonna kill me. I insulted
him in his own villa.

27:00.625 --> 27:03.194
- He'll forgive you.
- He's gonna fucking kill me, Dickie.

27:03.292 --> 27:06.316
He's gonna make Blinis out of
me balls and no one will care.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.457
- Fontaine's not gonna kill you.
- He could.

27:08.458 --> 27:10.541
No one would give a toss,
not even me own daughter.

27:10.542 --> 27:12.610
I would give a toss. She would too.

27:12.625 --> 27:16.275
12 years, Dickie, 12 years for
that money and I just blew it.

27:17.375 --> 27:18.852
You apologise to him.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.569
You be a gentleman and
he'll be a gentleman.

27:21.958 --> 27:23.275
It'll be all right.

27:23.917 --> 27:26.861
Yeah? You promise?

27:27.083 --> 27:30.374
Yes. But you don't insult his girl.

27:30.375 --> 27:33.166
You don't call him fucking Ivana,
you don't call him Anal-toli

27:33.167 --> 27:34.940
and you don't let him
see your pecker!

27:35.417 --> 27:37.291
You thank your goddamn lucky stars

27:37.292 --> 27:39.166
that he's a kind and gracious man.
Do you understand?

27:39.167 --> 27:40.291
- Yeah...
- Do you understand?

27:40.292 --> 27:42.770
- Yeah.
- Cos I ain't burying your body out here.

27:43.208 --> 27:46.187
I'm too fucking old and I
didn't bring the right shoes.

28:11.250 --> 28:12.772
Sorry I'm late.

28:14.542 --> 28:16.565
And sorry I was such a cunt.

28:22.208 --> 28:25.357
You must be Ivan's lady friend.

28:30.583 --> 28:33.562
You're a vision. You're an angel.

28:36.458 --> 28:38.981
Again, Ivan, Mr Fontaine,

28:39.417 --> 28:40.609
sorry.

28:40.667 --> 28:44.897
Me and, er, drink don't
always dance well together.

28:44.917 --> 28:47.145
I acted up. I acted outrageous.

28:47.667 --> 28:48.791
Sorry.

28:48.792 --> 28:52.476
Sorry I'm late for your dinner
and sorry about before.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.352
When you were a cunt?

28:55.625 --> 28:58.524
Yeah, when I was a cunt.

29:06.500 --> 29:10.605
Dom, it is water under the bridge.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.522
You are forgiven.

29:14.292 --> 29:16.861
- Thank you.
- Now, sit, sit.

29:18.875 --> 29:22.058
Dinner is ready. The
rabbit is getting cold.

29:31.167 --> 29:32.860
Fantastic.

29:33.375 --> 29:35.022
I'm starving.

29:45.500 --> 29:49.150
Everyone sit.
Get comfortable, please.

29:49.792 --> 29:52.270
Because you so enjoyed
the rabbit, Dom,

29:53.625 --> 29:55.477
I have a real treat for you.

30:06.458 --> 30:09.562
<i>♪ We were two friends in love</i>

30:15.917 --> 30:21.069

warm and sleepy in July</i>

30:25.708 --> 30:28.482
Isn't she great, Dom?

30:29.458 --> 30:34.234
She likes singing almost as
much as she likes my money.

30:35.792 --> 30:39.817
♪ Fanette each day

30:42.750 --> 30:46.525
You know I could have killed you for
saying what you did today, Dom?

30:47.750 --> 30:48.874
Yeah, I do.

30:48.875 --> 30:51.945

<i>♪ She was so beautiful

31:01.542 --> 31:03.110
When I was 14,

31:03.583 --> 31:05.936
my very best friend in the world

31:06.167 --> 31:09.624
was riding his bicycle and
he accidentally crashed

31:09.625 --> 31:11.898
into this girl I liked.

31:13.917 --> 31:16.361
Her name was Tatiana.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.519
We went to school together,

31:19.000 --> 31:21.194
though we hadn't ever talked.

31:21.667 --> 31:23.610
But I liked her from afar.

31:24.292 --> 31:29.353
Anyway, my best friend
accidentally crashed into her.

31:29.625 --> 31:31.693
She got banged up,

31:31.917 --> 31:35.726
got a black eye, crying,
the whole thing.

31:36.417 --> 31:41.068
I went over to my friend, took
the bike from him, lifted it up

31:41.417 --> 31:43.565
and smashed it over his head.

31:45.375 --> 31:51.437
Then I stomped on his hand with my
boot until every bone was broken.

31:51.583 --> 31:53.560
Then I took a rock

31:54.458 --> 31:57.641
and smashed it so
hard into his face,

31:57.750 --> 32:00.319
he not only lost most of his teeth

32:01.083 --> 32:03.481
but most of his jaw as well.

32:04.958 --> 32:06.560
This, Dom

32:07.583 --> 32:11.041
is what I did to my best friend
for having a fucking accident

32:11.042 --> 32:15.352
involving a girl I hadn't
even ever talked to.

32:19.208 --> 32:20.525
Now,

32:21.625 --> 32:26.606
do you know why I didn't do
anything to you today, Dom?

32:28.250 --> 32:29.647
Do you?

32:31.708 --> 32:33.230
Cos,

32:34.292 --> 32:36.065
you're a kind and gracious man.

32:37.333 --> 32:41.483
Yes, that, but really because

32:42.292 --> 32:46.772
after everything has
been said and done

32:49.875 --> 32:51.727
I do owe you, Dom.

32:54.792 --> 32:57.020
I do owe you.

33:09.958 --> 33:12.436
I'm going to make
right by you, Dom.

33:20.042 --> 33:22.645
- Would you turn around?
- What?

33:24.417 --> 33:26.499
In order to make right,
I need you to turn around.

33:26.500 --> 33:28.602
Oh, yeah, 'course.

33:30.625 --> 33:34.707
I know telling a safe-cracker to
turn around is kind of a funny thing

33:34.708 --> 33:37.231
when you're opening a safe, but...

33:44.250 --> 33:46.068
OK, Dom.

33:48.833 --> 33:51.607
Your share, plus interest.

33:52.125 --> 33:54.944
This is a quarter of
a million pounds.

33:58.417 --> 33:59.734
And this

34:01.792 --> 34:03.894
is another half a million.

34:06.333 --> 34:07.730
This, Dom.

34:08.667 --> 34:10.143
Is your present.

34:11.667 --> 34:15.442
Take it. Go on,
take it, it's yours.

34:36.458 --> 34:38.777
Oh, watch out!

34:41.958 --> 34:44.982
Oi, oh! Watch out!

34:45.958 --> 34:47.856
Ladies.

34:50.458 --> 34:52.356
Here, jump on.

34:52.625 --> 34:54.022
Whoo!

35:09.792 --> 35:11.109
Go, Dom!

35:44.000 --> 35:45.832
You're so bad!

35:45.833 --> 35:47.185
Whoo!

36:02.000 --> 36:03.898
You got a noble chin.

36:05.750 --> 36:09.935
Some people have weak
chins or sad chins.

36:09.958 --> 36:13.562
You got a very sturdy,
very noble chin.

36:15.833 --> 36:20.939
I know it's kind of a weird thing to say.
I mean, to just say out loud.

36:21.167 --> 36:24.124
But my mother told me there's
no better time for a compliment

36:24.125 --> 36:26.398
than the moment you think it, so...

36:26.500 --> 36:29.570
Well, you have very noble breasts.

36:30.750 --> 36:32.874
My name's Melody,

36:32.875 --> 36:36.149
though I've been told
I can't keep a melody.

36:36.542 --> 36:39.111
I'm gonna call you Lisa,
if that's OK with you.

36:39.250 --> 36:41.398
Lisa's the name of my cousin.

36:41.708 --> 36:43.481
Yeah, she's an actress.

36:43.625 --> 36:46.319
- I think she did a commercial.
- I acted once.

36:46.417 --> 36:50.147
Played the apothecary in Romeo
and Juliet. Reform school.

36:50.292 --> 36:53.441
I was pretty good, but I didn't
have the stomach for it,

36:53.792 --> 36:56.771
what was needed to
get the good parts.

36:57.083 --> 37:00.041
I didn't wanna have to
service the drama teacher,

37:00.042 --> 37:03.291
if you know what I mean. The
poor bastard who played Romeo,

37:03.292 --> 37:05.861
he was being tossed
since he was 13.

37:06.083 --> 37:09.249
The perv gave him all the good parts
even though he couldn't act a damn

37:09.250 --> 37:14.277
and his skin was volcanic
with pus and pimples.

37:14.375 --> 37:16.853
Ooh, I hate bad skin.

37:19.250 --> 37:23.400
- What's your name, anyway?
- I told you, Melody.

37:24.083 --> 37:29.644
Melody, Melody, with
a face so heavenly.

37:30.583 --> 37:32.332
What about you? What's your name?

37:32.333 --> 37:33.730
Me?

37:34.542 --> 37:37.316
I'm Dom. Didn't you know?

37:37.375 --> 37:38.476
Mmm-mmm.

37:39.208 --> 37:40.776
I'm Dom Hemingway.

37:41.083 --> 37:42.957
Dom Hemingway.

37:42.958 --> 37:46.541
I am Dom Hemingway!

37:59.792 --> 38:04.068
Oh, listen up, you owls and bears!

38:04.542 --> 38:08.582
You cocksuckers, plebeians
and moral cowards!

38:08.583 --> 38:12.733
You foxes, lions and paedophiles!

38:12.958 --> 38:18.110
Listen up, you freaks,
Philistines and otters!

38:18.375 --> 38:22.291
You queens, queers and
little-girl tears!

38:22.292 --> 38:25.896
I am Dom Hemingway!

38:26.083 --> 38:27.749
Dom Hemingway!

38:27.750 --> 38:30.749
And for my years of silence,

38:30.750 --> 38:34.749
I have been granted lordship
over everyone on the planet...

39:01.292 --> 39:05.416
12 fucking years
I kept my mouth shut.

39:05.417 --> 39:06.999
The most stand-up
man I have ever met...

39:07.000 --> 39:09.416
And I sat in that tiny cell
while my wife died of cancer.

39:09.417 --> 39:10.791
I do owe you.

39:10.792 --> 39:12.499
- Missed my Evelyn growing up.
- I do owe you.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.124
- 12 fucking years.
- Dom.

39:14.125 --> 39:15.624
Kept my mouth shut.
Missed my Evelyn growing up.

39:15.625 --> 39:16.957
You are due and you will be paid.

39:16.958 --> 39:18.981
Dom, can you wake up?

39:20.583 --> 39:21.980
Dom.

39:22.750 --> 39:24.568
Dom.

39:25.708 --> 39:27.401
Were you sleeping?

39:28.875 --> 39:31.582
Dom, where is the money?

39:31.583 --> 39:34.061
I want the money.

39:37.833 --> 39:38.934
The money.

39:41.208 --> 39:42.525
Oh...

39:44.833 --> 39:46.685
Oh, fuck.

39:48.542 --> 39:51.020
Oh, the money.

39:52.208 --> 39:54.310
Dom. Dom!

39:55.333 --> 39:58.061
My hand, I've lost my hand.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.568
I've got to find my hand.

40:06.125 --> 40:08.478
I think I have a splinter.

40:10.167 --> 40:11.332
What?

40:11.333 --> 40:14.186
I think I have a splinter in me.

40:15.333 --> 40:17.527
Do you know where Paolina is?

40:18.000 --> 40:19.727
Paolina!

40:20.000 --> 40:23.400
I think she might
have some tweezers.

40:23.708 --> 40:24.809
Paolina!

40:28.667 --> 40:30.690
Paolina!

40:30.750 --> 40:34.332
I think I'm just gonna wait
here and rest for a minute.

40:34.333 --> 40:38.017
All right, Ivan. Just rest.
Just rest.

40:45.250 --> 40:46.602
Fuck.

40:46.833 --> 40:49.311
Oh...

40:50.042 --> 40:51.519
Oh!

41:00.708 --> 41:01.809
Girl?

41:06.542 --> 41:07.894
Girl?

41:10.583 --> 41:12.060
Girl!

41:15.583 --> 41:17.560
Come on.

41:30.458 --> 41:31.901
Fucking...

41:33.250 --> 41:34.818
Fuck!

41:47.792 --> 41:49.519
Come on, girl.

41:49.750 --> 41:51.477
Come on, girl.

41:59.625 --> 42:02.979
Come on, girl. Come on!

42:03.542 --> 42:05.440
Come on, girl.

42:08.917 --> 42:10.109
Come on!

42:14.958 --> 42:17.652
Come on. Come on,
my love. Come on.

42:17.708 --> 42:20.607
Come on, love. Come on.
Come on, love.

42:20.708 --> 42:24.517
Come on, my love!
Come on! Come on!

42:24.542 --> 42:25.749
Come on.

42:28.375 --> 42:30.694
Come on, live!

42:35.750 --> 42:36.976
I found it, Dom.

42:37.125 --> 42:40.229
I found my hand. It was hiding
underneath one of the cars.

42:43.083 --> 42:45.356
Good on you, Dickie. Good on ya.

42:45.583 --> 42:48.027
- You saved my life.
- What?

42:50.208 --> 42:52.481
- You saved me.
- Nah.

42:53.792 --> 42:56.270
When you save a person's life,

42:56.667 --> 42:59.582
it means good luck
will smile down on you

42:59.583 --> 43:03.517
when you least expect
it and most need it.

43:08.417 --> 43:09.749
Thank you.

43:09.750 --> 43:11.648
I think everybody else is dead.

43:11.750 --> 43:14.649
Though I did see Paolina before.

43:14.917 --> 43:17.019
- Heading towards the road.
- The road?

43:17.167 --> 43:19.332
- Towards the villa.
- My money.

43:19.333 --> 43:21.832
- What about it?
- You wait here.

43:21.833 --> 43:24.186
For the police and the medics.

43:25.042 --> 43:28.146
But we weren't here. You
didn't fucking see us.

43:30.167 --> 43:32.269
My money's at the villa.

43:41.042 --> 43:42.832
Fuck me with a javelin!

43:42.833 --> 43:44.874
- Do you have a key?
- Why would I have a key?

43:44.875 --> 43:46.916
I don't know, you could
have asked Mr Fontaine.

43:46.917 --> 43:50.521
Mr Fontaine, with a
fender in his stomach?

43:53.708 --> 43:55.310
Poor man's key.

44:01.625 --> 44:03.541
- Where you going?
- To get into dry clothes.

44:03.542 --> 44:05.940
- Where are you going?
- To get my money!

44:15.417 --> 44:17.519
Fucking harlot.

44:22.292 --> 44:25.874
Fucking Romanian fucking harlot.

44:25.875 --> 44:27.832
What are you talking about, Dom?
You're frothing at the mouth.

44:27.833 --> 44:31.107
She come back and she took
my bag with the money.

44:31.417 --> 44:33.565
My fucking money.

44:34.542 --> 44:36.440
Paolina!

44:37.250 --> 44:41.150
Paolina! That was
my money you took!

44:41.625 --> 44:43.193
My money!

44:43.208 --> 44:44.810
Paolina!

44:49.125 --> 44:53.651
That was my money.
Mine, it was mine.

45:01.458 --> 45:03.686
I bled for that money.

45:05.750 --> 45:08.569
I bled for that money.

45:15.042 --> 45:16.439
Dom!

45:16.583 --> 45:17.684
Paolina!

45:22.417 --> 45:23.499
Shit!

45:23.500 --> 45:25.102
Paolina!

45:30.792 --> 45:32.735
Paolina!

46:36.833 --> 46:38.025
What?

46:45.625 --> 46:46.726
Why?

46:48.083 --> 46:52.063
Do I strike you as the type of
woman who wants to be poor?

47:38.000 --> 47:39.693
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

47:57.708 --> 47:59.435
Shh.

48:09.167 --> 48:10.814
What are you talking about?

48:10.875 --> 48:13.398
He says that wound on your
head is going to leave a scar.

48:13.792 --> 48:15.235
He a doctor, is he?

48:15.333 --> 48:17.276
He washes dishes at the
restaurant I work at.

48:17.792 --> 48:19.124
Oh, fucking hell.

48:20.958 --> 48:23.277
But he was a doctor in Senegal.

48:31.250 --> 48:33.291
He also says you are
one ugly bastard.

48:33.292 --> 48:35.666
Well, he's right there, ain't he?

48:37.250 --> 48:39.444
Not sure what happened to
you, but it wasn't pretty.

48:39.750 --> 48:41.227
Misfortune.

48:43.417 --> 48:45.519
Misfortune befell me.

48:51.958 --> 48:54.857
You need to rest now, Dom, OK?

49:30.417 --> 49:33.374
Evelyn said that as soon as
you could pee on two legs,

49:33.375 --> 49:34.647
you'd have to go.

49:37.167 --> 49:40.020
By the look of you,
I'd say that's today.

49:40.333 --> 49:43.166
- So she's not talking to me?
- She's at work.

49:43.167 --> 49:46.897
She's just throwing me out,
judge, jury and executioner.

49:47.833 --> 49:49.291
Just like that.

49:54.208 --> 49:56.527
- She hates me.
- She's mad at you.

49:56.958 --> 50:00.541
A lot of years of hurt. That
just doesn't go away like that.

50:00.542 --> 50:03.896
If anyone has the right
to be mad at life, it's me.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.024
I've had the shittiest luck in
the history of shitty luck.

50:07.667 --> 50:09.769
Look at me.

50:10.208 --> 50:11.730
I'm a mess.

50:14.250 --> 50:16.291
Face like an abortion.

50:16.292 --> 50:19.441
Broke as a teenager. Pissing
next to Afrika Bambaataa.

50:19.458 --> 50:21.356
You going there, Dom?

50:21.708 --> 50:23.435
Right. Sorry.

50:32.417 --> 50:33.518
Is that my grandson?

50:36.958 --> 50:40.062
I see your gene's a bit more
prominent, if you know what I mean.

50:40.125 --> 50:41.522
His name's Jawara.

50:42.833 --> 50:45.652
- You're kidding?
- It's Senegalese.

50:45.958 --> 50:49.232
- Diddle me with a voodoo doll.
- It means 'peace-loving'.

50:52.458 --> 50:56.938
I'm Dom. Dom's English for
'unlucky son of a bitch'.

50:59.208 --> 51:02.482
We're playing music tonight,
at Cargo. You know it?

51:02.708 --> 51:06.233
I can't guarantee anything,
but Evelyn will be there.

51:06.417 --> 51:08.690
- So maybe she'll talk with you then.
- You think?

51:09.333 --> 51:12.812
I don't really. But
it's worth a try.

51:16.250 --> 51:17.977
I'm scared.

51:18.833 --> 51:20.480
I would be too.

51:21.333 --> 51:23.106
She's a tough one.

52:19.750 --> 52:26.017
<i>♪ I wish I was a fisherman,
tumbling on the seas</i>

52:27.250 --> 52:32.777
<i>♪ Far away from dry land
and its bitter memories</i>

52:34.167 --> 52:39.945
<i>♪ Casting out my sweet line
with abandonment and love</i>

52:40.333 --> 52:46.520
<i>♪ No ceiling bearing down on
me save the starry sky above</i>

52:46.542 --> 52:49.111

52:54.625 --> 52:57.069

53:55.375 --> 53:57.068
Bloody fuck.

53:58.042 --> 53:59.999
- You all right, Dom?
- Fucking table.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.249
What's a fucking table doing there?
Anyone can knock into it.

54:03.250 --> 54:06.354
I'm gonna fucking burn
that table, I swear it.

54:17.250 --> 54:19.874
I take it, it didn't
go as planned tonight.

54:19.875 --> 54:22.082
It was just peachy, just peachy.

54:22.083 --> 54:23.916
Like one of them TV shows

54:23.917 --> 54:27.100
where everyone's all huggy
and kissy in the end.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.943
You didn't even say hello, then?

54:31.167 --> 54:32.860
God, I'm a shit.

54:33.250 --> 54:35.041
But you're her shit.

54:35.042 --> 54:37.486
I called her boyfriend
Afrika Bambaataa.

54:37.667 --> 54:39.440
That was smart.

54:39.792 --> 54:42.190
She don't want me, Dickie.

54:42.750 --> 54:44.666
Who can fucking blame her?

54:44.667 --> 54:47.646
Get near me, you're likely to die,

54:48.458 --> 54:50.731
or at least lose all your money.

54:54.458 --> 54:56.276
Oh, yeah, sorry.

55:01.417 --> 55:03.519
This wasn't how it
was supposed to be.

55:04.625 --> 55:06.102
I know.

55:09.333 --> 55:10.935
What are you gonna do, then?

55:12.708 --> 55:16.767
A man with no options suddenly
has all the options in the world.

55:18.125 --> 55:20.624
- What the hell does that mean?
- Don't know.

55:32.042 --> 55:33.485
Doomsday plan.

55:33.792 --> 55:36.065
- I gotta see Lestor Junior.
- No.

55:36.167 --> 55:37.359
Yeah.

55:37.458 --> 55:39.249
- Bugger.
- Fucker.

55:39.250 --> 55:41.523
Shit, Dom. The son's
worse than the father.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.773
Yeah. Shit, Dickie.

55:44.125 --> 55:46.648
But Fontaine ain't
exactly hiring, is he?

56:17.917 --> 56:19.564
All right, son?

56:24.167 --> 56:26.082
Dom, Dom Hemingway.

56:27.250 --> 56:29.207
I didn't think I'd recognise you...

56:29.208 --> 56:31.207
Seeing as I was barely a
teenager and everything.

56:31.208 --> 56:33.916
- That's right.
- But I did. I'm proud of myself.

56:35.208 --> 56:36.707
Fucking hell.

56:36.708 --> 56:39.061
Why did you kill my cat, Dom?

56:41.875 --> 56:45.400
You're gonna bring that
up after all these years?

56:45.958 --> 56:48.624
I am. What did that
cat ever do to you?

56:48.625 --> 56:49.916
It was your father's cat, Les.

56:49.917 --> 56:51.940
That was your father's cat.
He was competition.

56:52.167 --> 56:54.332
No matter. I loved that cat.

56:54.333 --> 56:56.356
That cat was my friend.

56:56.667 --> 56:59.270
Sorry, OK? I'm sorry.

56:59.542 --> 57:00.791
I bet you are.

57:00.792 --> 57:03.582
But you disrespected my cat
and I can't forgive that.

57:03.583 --> 57:05.957
I was just a little boy, you know.

57:05.958 --> 57:09.107
Well, I'm ready to put
the past to rest, huh?

57:09.333 --> 57:11.124
Let bygones be bygones.

57:11.125 --> 57:13.944
Thought maybe we could do
some business together.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.479
You're a killer of cats, Dom,
and I want nothing to do with you.

57:21.542 --> 57:22.734
I said I was sorry.

57:22.833 --> 57:26.062
I know you're sorry, but that
don't bring Bernard back to life.

57:26.958 --> 57:30.541
See, that's what I'm talking about.
Who calls their cat Bernard?

57:30.542 --> 57:33.065
'Course I killed your fucking cat.

57:41.625 --> 57:42.977
Come on.

57:43.958 --> 57:45.810
Damn it. Come on!

57:51.125 --> 57:53.523
You know I'm good at what I do.

57:53.958 --> 57:56.041
Your father wanted
me to work for him.

57:56.042 --> 57:59.225
But you never said yes, Dom.
You never said yes.

57:59.250 --> 58:01.624
I worked for Mr Fontaine.
I couldn't say yes.

58:01.625 --> 58:03.082
You could have, but you didn't.

58:03.083 --> 58:05.249
- I didn't cos I couldn't.
- You couldn't cos you wouldn't.

58:05.250 --> 58:07.191
I wouldn't cos I couldn't.
That's why I didn't.

58:07.250 --> 58:10.024
Fuck you! Couldn't,
wouldn't, shouldn't.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.068
I got the magic fingers.

58:14.917 --> 58:16.749
You know that, I always did.

58:16.750 --> 58:18.582
You must remember that.

58:18.583 --> 58:20.249
Magic fingers, Lestor.

58:20.250 --> 58:22.832
You could use that. Your
business could use that.

58:22.833 --> 58:24.332
I run clubs, Dom.

58:26.833 --> 58:29.124
Bullshit, Lestor. You
know what you do.

58:29.125 --> 58:32.024
It's no secret. It's
your family business.

58:32.667 --> 58:34.624
See, there's a part of me

58:34.625 --> 58:37.124
that wants to put you in the
trunk of my sister's Prius,

58:37.125 --> 58:40.916
drive you up to Canvey Island and bury
you up to your thick fucking neck,

58:40.917 --> 58:43.440
cover your fat fucking
face in hamburger patties

58:43.458 --> 58:46.707
and let the creatures of the night
eat you to death while I watch.

58:46.708 --> 58:49.416
That's what I want,
you eaten to death

58:49.417 --> 58:52.416
bite by fucking bite,
peck by fucking peck

58:52.417 --> 58:54.986
and fang by motherfucking fang.

58:58.042 --> 59:02.067
See, I heard Belly retired and
his replacement's disappointing.

59:03.042 --> 59:05.457
So you come to the son of the
man you was at war with?

59:05.458 --> 59:06.541
He was competition.

59:06.542 --> 59:10.082
You come to the little boy
whose pussy cat you murdered?

59:10.083 --> 59:11.560
You need me, Lestor.

59:12.250 --> 59:15.354
You're an old man, Dom.
You should retire, too.

59:21.333 --> 59:22.810
I meant to.

59:23.042 --> 59:25.110
Yeah, I bet you did.

01:00:02.167 --> 01:00:03.610
It's not like the old days, Dom.

01:00:04.125 --> 01:00:06.273
They've got electronics now.

01:00:09.208 --> 01:00:10.651
A safe's a safe.

01:00:10.875 --> 01:00:12.977
Until you can't open it.

01:00:13.792 --> 01:00:16.270
Come by my club tonight at 11:00.

01:00:16.417 --> 01:00:17.814
Sugarfix.

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:19.977
I have a new electronic safe there.

01:00:20.042 --> 01:00:23.249
If you can open it in 10 minutes,
you can come and work for me,

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:25.068
bygones be bygones.

01:00:25.417 --> 01:00:27.457
I'll have plenty of
solid business for you.

01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:30.107
However, if you can't open it,

01:00:30.333 --> 01:00:33.277
I'm gonna chop off your tiny
dick and use it as a doorjamb.

01:00:35.708 --> 01:00:38.527
It's your call, Dom.
Show up or not.

01:00:39.333 --> 01:00:41.310
Open the safe or not.

01:00:41.667 --> 01:00:43.986
Piss standing up again or not.

01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:47.350
Those are your options.
Those are your choices.

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.193
And that was for Bernard.

01:00:53.542 --> 01:00:56.249
- I thought that's what the last one was for.
- Nah, nah, nah.

01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:58.352
That was for my daddy.
This one is for Bernard.

01:00:58.583 --> 01:01:00.416
He was a good fucking cat

01:01:00.417 --> 01:01:02.957
and didn't deserve your ugly face
to be the last thing he saw.

01:01:21.333 --> 01:01:22.980
Thanks, Jeanie.

01:01:25.542 --> 01:01:27.916
Are you sure you should be
drinking like this, Dom?

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:29.269
I'm good, Mum.

01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:31.707
I'm serious.

01:01:31.708 --> 01:01:34.666
You've got to open a safe later and
you haven't opened one in 12 years.

01:01:34.667 --> 01:01:37.737
I'm steady as a trapeze
artist's cunt.

01:01:38.583 --> 01:01:40.651
- Let me see your hand.
- What?

01:01:40.708 --> 01:01:44.017
Your hand. I want to see
if you're really steady.

01:01:44.208 --> 01:01:47.291
Look at your own hand, Dickie,
if you haven't lost it again.

01:01:49.542 --> 01:01:53.067
Seriously, put out your hand,
Dom. Let me see it.

01:01:55.708 --> 01:01:56.809
Fucker.

01:01:57.917 --> 01:01:59.749
I could do surgery with this hand,

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:02.249
operate on your caper-sized brain,

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:04.978
finger a nun from five feet away.

01:02:05.208 --> 01:02:07.207
That safe don't scare me.

01:02:07.208 --> 01:02:10.642
Lestor McGreevy don't scare me.
Nothing scares me.

01:02:11.042 --> 01:02:13.941
Well, you're scaring me,
that much is true.

01:02:14.625 --> 01:02:16.193
I'm good.

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:20.482
You're penniless, homeless. You're
fast on your way to being pissed.

01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:23.041
Your wank's on the line

01:02:23.042 --> 01:02:25.736
and you haven't opened
a safe in 12 years,

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:28.148
and not an electronic
one, not ever.

01:02:28.208 --> 01:02:30.749
Aren't you the Easter
Bunny, hopping around,

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.898
spreading good cheer
wherever you go?

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:35.651
I'm just stating what I'm stating.

01:02:35.792 --> 01:02:39.457
- Stop stating what you're stating.
- I'm not gonna stop stating it.

01:02:39.458 --> 01:02:41.435
I'll state what I want to state
in whatever state I want to.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:43.231
State it again, I'll
knock your teeth out.

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:44.957
Knock my teeth out,
I'll cut your ear off.

01:02:44.958 --> 01:02:47.541
Cut my ear off, I'll carve
your eye out with my big toe.

01:02:47.542 --> 01:02:48.624
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

01:02:48.625 --> 01:02:49.726
Fuck you.

01:02:50.958 --> 01:02:53.527
You think I ain't gonna
be able to do this?

01:02:53.958 --> 01:02:55.957
Me, Dom Hemingway?
Think I can't do this?

01:02:55.958 --> 01:02:59.582
There hasn't been a safe I
ain't been able to open, ever.

01:02:59.583 --> 01:03:02.857
When I was four months old, I could
open a safe from my fucking pram.

01:03:03.208 --> 01:03:05.151
I'm just saying.

01:03:05.833 --> 01:03:07.606
Don't say nothing.

01:03:11.917 --> 01:03:15.066
I'm gonna do this, Dickie.
I'm gonna do this.

01:03:17.542 --> 01:03:19.485
I got no other choice.

01:03:50.042 --> 01:03:53.041
State of the art. Had it
installed four months ago.

01:03:53.042 --> 01:03:55.691
- Made in Japan.
- I'm big in Japan.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:04:00.041
You have 10 minutes. Do you
want me to start the timing now?

01:04:00.042 --> 01:04:03.942
Or do you want to say a little
prayer for your friend Tiny first?

01:04:03.958 --> 01:04:06.607
I just want another pint.
Is that OK?

01:04:07.125 --> 01:04:09.478
Another drink before we start.

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:12.694
Have all the beer you want, Dom.

01:05:08.833 --> 01:05:10.856
Right, let's get started.

01:05:11.917 --> 01:05:13.832
Clock says 11:35.

01:05:13.833 --> 01:05:16.561
It means you have until 11:45.

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.478
Easy-peasy lemon squeezy.

01:05:26.667 --> 01:05:28.144
What the fuck is that?

01:05:28.208 --> 01:05:29.730
Equipment.

01:05:33.333 --> 01:05:34.901
Bloody hell!

01:05:35.417 --> 01:05:38.145
Fuck you and fuck your cat.

01:05:38.208 --> 01:05:42.438
I said, open my safe,
not destroy my office.

01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:45.562
Fuck your office, fuck you,

01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:48.444
fuck your father and fuck your cat.

01:05:48.458 --> 01:05:52.142
In nine minutes your balls
are becoming trinkets.

01:05:52.167 --> 01:05:56.568
Fuck your trinkets, fuck
your cat, fuck your father,

01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:59.353
fuck your office and fuck you!

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:17.082
Not sure what you can do
in the time you have left,

01:06:17.083 --> 01:06:18.526
except maybe have a heart attack.

01:06:18.667 --> 01:06:20.485
I got to do a piss.

01:06:20.708 --> 01:06:23.527
- What?
- Piss. I got to.

01:06:23.542 --> 01:06:25.707
I'm not stopping the clock.

01:06:25.708 --> 01:06:28.778
'Course you aren't.
You're pond scum, Lestor.

01:06:28.833 --> 01:06:30.832
Garbage, refuse.

01:06:30.833 --> 01:06:33.356
Your father was a class
act compared to you.

01:06:33.417 --> 01:06:37.522
You're shit on my shoe.
You're a cunt in gold chains.

01:06:37.542 --> 01:06:41.727
A misery in size 10 Adidas. Now,
where's your fucking toilet?

01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:51.935
- Who designed this place, anyway?
- I did, actually.

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:54.832
It's like a brothel
by way of Elton John.

01:06:54.833 --> 01:06:56.901
Stick to thieving and nepotism.

01:07:03.708 --> 01:07:04.980
What are you looking at?

01:07:09.083 --> 01:07:10.560
Five minutes left, Dom.

01:07:10.708 --> 01:07:13.249
Might be the last time
you piss standing up.

01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:16.684
I assume the cables in
the back of the safe

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:19.861
are attached to some
security company.

01:07:19.917 --> 01:07:22.486
Yes. They promised a
five-minute response.

01:07:22.667 --> 01:07:24.666
I promised not to come
in your sister's mouth.

01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:26.916
We all make promises we can't keep.

01:07:38.542 --> 01:07:41.942
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
do anything to Lestor,

01:07:42.042 --> 01:07:44.236
as tempting as that may be.

01:08:04.667 --> 01:08:06.144
Four minutes,

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:08.457
or less if security comes.

01:08:08.458 --> 01:08:12.734
The fastest fingers guy I ever saw took
10, 12 minutes with a safe like this,

01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:15.332
and he had state-of-the-art
equipment with him.

01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:18.937
- I ain't like most finger guys.
- No, you're not.

01:08:19.167 --> 01:08:21.144
- You're old.
- I'm old-school.

01:08:21.207 --> 01:08:23.310
Old, old-school, same thing.

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:26.642
I got magic fingers,
Lestor. I told you.

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:28.850
So?

01:08:31.082 --> 01:08:32.526
So...

01:08:39.875 --> 01:08:41.272
Whoa!

01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:43.818
Yeah, yeah...

01:08:45.042 --> 01:08:48.191
- What the hell are you doing, man?
- Fuck you.

01:08:48.292 --> 01:08:52.272
You trying to screw the safe, Dom,
or are you trying to impregnate it?

01:08:52.542 --> 01:08:54.189
Do you want me to get
you guys a room?

01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:57.818
Seriously, what the hell
are you doing, man?

01:08:57.832 --> 01:08:59.207
I'm winning the bet.

01:08:59.207 --> 01:09:01.568
Japs sold you a cheap safe
and he's gonna win because of it.

01:09:01.875 --> 01:09:03.707
It wasn't fucking cheap.

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:06.249
Then you got ripped off, Lestor.

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:07.522
Fucking ripped off.

01:09:08.332 --> 01:09:09.832
Ha, ha, ha!

01:09:09.832 --> 01:09:11.666
So what's he trying to do, Dickie?

01:09:11.667 --> 01:09:14.207
Most safes, the cheap ones
at least, like yours,

01:09:14.207 --> 01:09:16.957
if you bounce them enough, there's
a moment when the pins are shaken

01:09:16.957 --> 01:09:19.152
and not lined up, even
the electronic ones.

01:09:19.167 --> 01:09:22.066
If you're pulling the handle
at that moment, it opens.

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:25.332
Well, nothing's happening here
except Dom getting a fucking hernia.

01:09:25.332 --> 01:09:29.768
And you've only got two...
No, one minute and 55 seconds left.

01:09:29.792 --> 01:09:32.770
<i>♪ God save</i>

01:09:33.167 --> 01:09:37.067
<i>♪ The Queen ♪</i>

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:45.193
Pints are on me!

01:09:47.332 --> 01:09:50.357
And that, my friends,

01:09:50.542 --> 01:09:52.814
is how you open a safe.

01:09:52.832 --> 01:09:55.027
You did it, Dom. You right did it.

01:09:55.125 --> 01:09:57.582
I knew I would. I told you I would.

01:09:57.583 --> 01:10:00.666
I knew I'd beat this
arsehole at his own game

01:10:00.667 --> 01:10:03.624
and prove to him what the
world already knows,

01:10:03.625 --> 01:10:09.653
that Dom Hemingway is the greatest
safe cracker known to mankind.

01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:12.353
That I am a legend, a myth.

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:17.811
A glorious tale to be handed down
from generation to generation.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.603
I am impressed, Dom, I must say.

01:10:20.667 --> 01:10:23.941
Fucking right, Lestor, Chestor,

01:10:24.042 --> 01:10:27.541
Chestor the molester, Uncle Fester.

01:10:27.542 --> 01:10:29.416
And only 52 seconds left.

01:10:29.417 --> 01:10:33.192
Exactly, Fester the
fucking court jester.

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:35.899
I won the bet. You owe me work.

01:10:36.042 --> 01:10:37.894
Big-paying work.

01:10:38.417 --> 01:10:41.236
Actually, you didn't win the bet.

01:10:45.833 --> 01:10:47.150
What are you talking about?

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:52.439
I'm saying, in 30 seconds
I'm cutting Little Dom off.

01:10:52.542 --> 01:10:54.861
I opened your safe.

01:10:54.958 --> 01:10:57.106
You opened a safe.

01:10:57.375 --> 01:11:00.749
But my safe, my safe is this.

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:03.148
You have eight seconds
to open it, seven...

01:11:03.167 --> 01:11:05.144
- That ain't fair.
- Fuck fair, it's the bet.

01:11:05.292 --> 01:11:08.066
Five, four, three,

01:11:08.208 --> 01:11:09.832
two, one.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.818
Poor Dom Hemingway.

01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:22.231
Poor, poor Dom Hemingway.

01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:27.560
All that time in prison, only to
come out and be humiliated

01:11:27.708 --> 01:11:30.778
by the son of the man
he always hated.

01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:37.541
You're not really gonna do
what you're saying, Lestor?

01:11:37.542 --> 01:11:39.041
If I were you,
I'd keep quiet, Dickie.

01:11:39.042 --> 01:11:42.442
You know I'll kill you too
and no one will give a shit.

01:11:42.458 --> 01:11:44.936
- Now, take off your trousers.
- Come on.

01:11:46.333 --> 01:11:48.527
- Lestor.
- I'm serious.

01:11:50.958 --> 01:11:52.935
Aw, fuck!

01:11:56.833 --> 01:11:59.732
A deal's a deal, a bet's a bet

01:11:59.958 --> 01:12:02.060
and a dick doorstop
is a dick doorstop.

01:12:02.542 --> 01:12:04.144
Lestor, come on.

01:12:04.292 --> 01:12:07.475
I hate you, Dom. I always
have. You killed Bernard.

01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:11.457
You can't out off my dick
because of a fucking cat.

01:12:11.458 --> 01:12:13.356
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

01:12:14.042 --> 01:12:17.396
OK, no, I can't, you're right,
but I can cut it off

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:20.832
cos you said you could open my
safe in 10 minutes and you didn't.

01:12:20.833 --> 01:12:22.731
- You rigged the bet.
- Semantics.

01:12:22.833 --> 01:12:26.624
- I played by the rules.
- People are dirty, Dom. You should know that.

01:12:26.625 --> 01:12:28.272
But I played by the rules.

01:12:28.625 --> 01:12:30.457
That's your problem.

01:12:30.458 --> 01:12:32.207
You're a fucking criminal.

01:12:32.208 --> 01:12:34.082
Criminals don't have rules.

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:36.311
There's a code of ethics. There is!

01:12:37.167 --> 01:12:39.457
And where did that code get you?

01:12:39.458 --> 01:12:44.332
12 years alone, a dead wife
and a daughter who hates you.

01:12:44.333 --> 01:12:45.980
You don't know!

01:12:47.083 --> 01:12:49.060
Everyone knows.

01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:55.071
You played by the rules in jail and
you got screwed when you got out.

01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:59.358
You played by the rules here
and you got screwed here.

01:13:01.708 --> 01:13:04.732
You're a dumb criminal,
Dom. A dumb man.

01:13:06.333 --> 01:13:08.124
Now take off your trousers.

01:13:11.542 --> 01:13:12.859
Lestor.

01:13:13.458 --> 01:13:14.810
Now.

01:13:34.833 --> 01:13:36.105
Now!

01:13:51.958 --> 01:13:53.560
Safe security.

01:14:19.708 --> 01:14:22.891
- I'll meet you at the place near the place.
- Right.

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:41.819
You can't fucking catch me.

01:14:53.958 --> 01:14:56.749
Oh, fu... Oh, fuck...

01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:58.477
Oh, fuck...

01:15:50.625 --> 01:15:53.228
Hey, you lot need a back-up
singer, I am available.

01:16:07.458 --> 01:16:08.855
What do you want, then?

01:16:09.583 --> 01:16:12.357
What? Nothing. I just
wanna say hello.

01:16:13.375 --> 01:16:16.416
You look like shit, but at least you're
standing up. That's an improvement.

01:16:16.417 --> 01:16:18.440
Yeah, I got that going.

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:23.374
Tell me something, Dom. You know
how old I was when you went away?

01:16:23.375 --> 01:16:26.874
Can your fogged-up, whisky-soaked
brain go back that far?

01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:28.477
Yeah, 'course.

01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:31.041
I remember being in my room

01:16:31.042 --> 01:16:33.783
and hearing mum yelling at you when
you left. Do you remember that?

01:16:34.792 --> 01:16:39.022
She was just pleading, begging
with you to strike a deal.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.832
If you'd have testified, you'd
have got two, maybe three years.

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:46.249
You'd have been out
before I was 13,

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:49.399
before mum got sick,
before mum died.

01:16:50.375 --> 01:16:52.332
I wanna make up for lost time.
That's why I'm here.

01:16:52.333 --> 01:16:53.685
I don't.

01:16:55.583 --> 01:16:58.277
Come on, now. I made a mistake.

01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:02.249
I'm a fucker and I'm a failure.

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:04.874
Oh, Dom, I'm leaving.
I have to go. I...

01:17:04.875 --> 01:17:07.819
I don't want you coming
round here any more.

01:17:08.167 --> 01:17:11.976
I don't want you coming round
my house or my son, OK?

01:17:12.583 --> 01:17:15.061
I don't want to see you.

01:17:20.208 --> 01:17:22.666
You have done very little
for me in my life, Dom.

01:17:22.667 --> 01:17:25.441
Please, just do that.

01:17:26.583 --> 01:17:29.766
It's Dad. It's Dad. It's not Dom.

01:17:40.542 --> 01:17:41.859
Evie.

01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:48.068
What, Dom?

01:17:49.042 --> 01:17:51.707
I'm gonna go and see your
mum's grave tomorrow morning.

01:17:51.708 --> 01:17:55.233
I wondered if you wanted
to come. I ain't seen it yet.

01:17:58.667 --> 01:18:01.416
What, the grave Sandy
Butterfield paid for,

01:18:01.417 --> 01:18:03.360
the guy you beat the shit out of?

01:18:05.292 --> 01:18:06.939
Yeah, that one.

01:18:08.458 --> 01:18:11.541
I thought it would be
nice if we went together.

01:18:11.542 --> 01:18:13.644
You could bring your boy.

01:18:13.708 --> 01:18:17.893
You know what would have been
nice? Having a real father.

01:18:18.417 --> 01:18:20.565
But I didn't get one, Dom.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.647
I only got you.

01:19:01.375 --> 01:19:02.692
Melody.

01:19:04.875 --> 01:19:05.976
Wait!

01:19:10.167 --> 01:19:11.268
Wait!

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:15.734
Melody!

01:19:17.708 --> 01:19:18.809
Melody!

01:19:24.083 --> 01:19:26.124
You said I'd have good luck.

01:19:26.125 --> 01:19:27.647
Dom Hemingway.

01:19:27.708 --> 01:19:30.527
I was so worried about you.

01:19:30.792 --> 01:19:32.082
But you're OK.

01:19:32.083 --> 01:19:34.291
No, I'm not... I'm not
doing very well, actually.

01:19:34.292 --> 01:19:37.582
You said I'd have good luck.
I've had nothing but shitty luck.

01:19:37.583 --> 01:19:39.916
I'm so sorry to hear that, Dom.

01:19:39.917 --> 01:19:41.166
If I hadn't stopped and helped you,

01:19:41.167 --> 01:19:44.146
I'd have had time to save
my money from being stolen.

01:19:44.167 --> 01:19:47.271
But you saved my life.
You stopped to save my life.

01:19:47.292 --> 01:19:49.895
- I know.
- You did the right thing.

01:19:50.083 --> 01:19:52.356
Not everyone would, but you did.

01:19:52.792 --> 01:19:56.457
I told you the good luck would
come when you really need it.

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.481
Well, I really need it.

01:19:58.542 --> 01:20:00.986
- Then it will be.
- How?

01:20:01.583 --> 01:20:03.916
What do you want
most in the world?

01:20:03.917 --> 01:20:06.145
My fucking money!

01:20:07.375 --> 01:20:09.819
- That's what you want most?
- Yes.

01:20:09.875 --> 01:20:11.898
- You sure?
- Yes!

01:20:13.667 --> 01:20:15.440
- Really?
- Yes.

01:20:17.667 --> 01:20:18.768
No.

01:20:26.458 --> 01:20:28.560
I want her to talk to me.

01:20:30.417 --> 01:20:31.894
Forgive me.

01:20:33.958 --> 01:20:35.560
My daughter.

01:20:37.375 --> 01:20:38.943
That seems a little better.

01:20:39.458 --> 01:20:41.026
Yeah, well...

01:20:41.292 --> 01:20:44.666
Just by picking her,
you've already shown

01:20:44.667 --> 01:20:47.566
that the pendulum of luck
is swinging your way.

01:20:47.708 --> 01:20:49.499
What the hell does that mean?

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:52.353
Love is what you make, Dom.

01:21:08.375 --> 01:21:10.352
Oh, Keethy.

01:21:15.125 --> 01:21:17.068
I fucked up, didn't I?

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:22.645
And not one of my
minor Dom fuck-ups.

01:21:23.458 --> 01:21:26.937
Like spending all our money
down the pub with Dickie.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:32.025
Going out to a football match
and staying away a week.

01:21:33.667 --> 01:21:37.166
Burning down that housing
estate in Leeds by accident.

01:21:39.958 --> 01:21:41.184
No.

01:21:43.583 --> 01:21:45.685
I fucked up royally.

01:21:48.292 --> 01:21:50.895
I didn't get to say goodbye to you.

01:21:53.292 --> 01:21:57.818
I never got to say goodbye and
kiss you goodbye, my sweet girl.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:03.166
Now all I got is this dirt,

01:22:03.167 --> 01:22:07.067
fucking grass and dirt in me
hands, and not your sweet face.

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:11.652
Your sweet, beautiful face.

01:22:19.667 --> 01:22:21.610
I was a stupid fool.

01:22:23.583 --> 01:22:25.151
I lost you.

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:30.194
I lost out on our
Evelyn's childhood.

01:22:31.792 --> 01:22:34.975
I lost the two most important
things in my life.

01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:38.693
And now you're gone...

01:22:39.958 --> 01:22:41.901
and our Evie...

01:22:44.792 --> 01:22:46.485
she hates me.

01:22:51.125 --> 01:22:52.898
Oh, Keethy...

01:22:54.458 --> 01:22:57.858
Beautiful, sweet Keethy. My life.

01:23:00.792 --> 01:23:02.269
My heart.

01:23:16.875 --> 01:23:19.728
I'm gonna try and make
things better with Evelyn.

01:23:19.958 --> 01:23:21.526
I really am.

01:23:23.625 --> 01:23:25.773
She hates me now

01:23:27.167 --> 01:23:29.315
but I'll wear her down,

01:23:29.667 --> 01:23:31.235
bit by bit.

01:23:33.583 --> 01:23:35.230
Day by day.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.559
Hour by hour, I'll seduce
her with my kindness.

01:23:41.042 --> 01:23:45.227
I'll blanket her in
warmth and security.

01:23:47.625 --> 01:23:50.478
I'll confound her with my decency.

01:23:52.667 --> 01:23:55.737
She'll resist my charms
for only so long.

01:23:57.583 --> 01:23:59.981
After all, I'm Dom Hemingway.

01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:04.693
I'm Dom Hemingway.

01:24:08.083 --> 01:24:09.810
I'm your Dom.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.353
Come here. Sit down.

01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:27.023
Give us your hand.

01:24:29.833 --> 01:24:33.358
That's your grandmother.
Keethy, or Katherine.

01:24:38.583 --> 01:24:43.314
She never much liked the dark ones, but
I think she'd have really liked you.

01:25:09.458 --> 01:25:11.166
I didn't think you'd come.

01:25:11.167 --> 01:25:13.541
Couldn't well take the
bus himself, could he?

01:25:16.375 --> 01:25:18.523
Can I walk with you a bit?

01:25:19.042 --> 01:25:21.065
In silence, I promise.

01:25:21.292 --> 01:25:23.582
Total silence, like... Like a mime.

01:25:23.583 --> 01:25:26.857
Like an old lady who lives
in an attic on her own

01:25:27.458 --> 01:25:30.107
and stuffs her cats
after they died.

01:25:36.667 --> 01:25:38.269
Not today.

01:25:45.375 --> 01:25:47.819
Someday, then, eh, maybe?

01:25:53.708 --> 01:25:56.402
You can walk Jawara to school
on Monday morning if you like.

01:25:57.875 --> 01:25:59.898
If you can wake up that early.

01:26:00.292 --> 01:26:02.986
Don't get too pissed
the night before.

01:26:09.167 --> 01:26:10.689
Right, then.

01:27:04.167 --> 01:27:06.816
Well, I'll be the Vatican's cunt.

01:27:12.083 --> 01:27:14.874
I'll see you later.
Right, let's go in.

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:37.686
Paolina! Hello, darling.

01:27:40.208 --> 01:27:43.332
Fancy seeing you here in London.
Why didn't you call me?

01:27:43.333 --> 01:27:44.957
We could have gone out for a drink,

01:27:44.958 --> 01:27:47.416
had a tone-deaf sing-along
to some old records.

01:27:47.417 --> 01:27:49.315
Paolina, who is this?

01:27:49.708 --> 01:27:51.685
I don't know who this man is.

01:27:51.958 --> 01:27:53.605
Oh...

01:27:54.083 --> 01:27:56.026
I'll tell you who I am.

01:27:56.250 --> 01:27:59.900
I'm the fucker who'll tear
your nose off with my teeth.

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:03.874
I'm the fucker who will gut
you with a dull cheese knife

01:28:03.875 --> 01:28:06.291
and sing Gilbert and
Sullivan while I do it.

01:28:06.292 --> 01:28:10.291
I'm the fucker who'll dump your
dead body in a freezing cold lake

01:28:10.292 --> 01:28:13.646
and watch you sink to the
bottom like so much shit.

01:28:14.583 --> 01:28:16.310
I am that fucker.

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:19.235
That's the fucker who I am.

01:28:20.375 --> 01:28:24.105
And if you say one word
when I remove my hand,

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:26.499
I'll do all that to you right now.

01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:30.957
You say one word and you'll be as useless
as a dried-up, fetid condom after bad sex.

01:28:30.958 --> 01:28:32.916
Do I make myself clear?

01:28:32.917 --> 01:28:34.707
Do my words translate to you?

01:28:34.708 --> 01:28:37.061
If you understand my words, nod.

01:28:39.292 --> 01:28:40.814
That's good.

01:28:42.292 --> 01:28:46.272
After much heartbreak and ruin,

01:28:47.542 --> 01:28:51.522
the pendulum of luck has finally
swung back to Dom Hemingway.

01:28:53.083 --> 01:28:56.767
And I intend to enjoy each
moment of its fickle pleasure,

01:28:57.042 --> 01:29:00.942
whether it lasts for a minute,
a day or a lifetime.
