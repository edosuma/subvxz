WEBVTT

00:40.874 --> 00:41.966
Whoo!

01:04.313 --> 01:05.907
Security breach in the gem room.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.434
Yes.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.151
Sweet, Renee. Awesome, Teresa.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.438
Hi, Barbie.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.864
Hey, Chelsea.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.775
That's my sister.

01:47.858 --> 01:50.452
You rock, Teresa. Whoo-hoo!

01:50.611 --> 01:51.703
Thanks, Mila.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.200
You go, Renee. Go, girl.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.036
Ha, ha. Oh, yeah.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.541
Thanks, Aunt Zoe.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.619
It's so sweet that she came.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.628
Actually, has she ever
missed a meet?

02:00.704 --> 02:01.956
Uh, probably not.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.965
Other than
watching TV and knitting,

02:04.041 --> 02:06.715
I don't think
she has much going on.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.719
<i>Athletes, take your places.</i>

02:12.841 --> 02:15.219
<i>The competition
will begin momentarily.</i>

02:18.055 --> 02:20.149
Go! Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

02:20.223 --> 02:22.021
Yeah, Barbie! Whoo!

02:22.184 --> 02:24.528
Um, but I'm not ready yet.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.235
I wanna practice
one more time, real quick.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.367
Relax, you'll be great.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.366
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

02:34.529 --> 02:37.999
<i>these are the golden cup
championship qualifying trials.</i>

03:11.066 --> 03:13.615
Wow, Patricia just
raised the bar.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.450
You know what that means.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.785
Time to bring our A game.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.916
Pandora's pyramid.

04:10.667 --> 04:14.092
Barbie! Barbie! Barbie!

04:14.171 --> 04:16.515
Barbie! Barbie! Barbie!

04:16.673 --> 04:18.346
Uh...

04:18.507 --> 04:20.851
Get it together, Barbie.

04:31.521 --> 04:36.197
Barbie! Barbie! Barbie!

04:39.446 --> 04:41.619
Oh! Whoa! Unh!

04:42.949 --> 04:45.168
Oh! Oh, no!

04:45.827 --> 04:48.330
Ugh. I totally
psyched myself out.

04:48.497 --> 04:52.047
Don't be so hard on yourself. We still
qualified for the championship.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.381
Barely.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.212
You just need to get
out of your head.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.346
Yeah. Stop worrying so much.

05:00.217 --> 05:03.562
Oh, it's Auntie Zoe.
Hey, Auntie Z. What's up?

05:03.720 --> 05:05.893
<i>How would
my three favorite gymnasts</i>

05:06.056 --> 05:09.026
<i>like to join me for
a relaxing picnic?</i>

05:09.643 --> 05:11.520
We do like picnics.

05:11.686 --> 05:12.983
Sure. Sounds like fun.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.155
<i>Oh, great.</i>

05:14.314 --> 05:17.534
<i>I know just the spot.
I'll text you the location.</i>

05:17.692 --> 05:19.569
Okay. See you.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.706
See'? Things are
looking up already.

05:30.914 --> 05:34.043
Wow, what an amazing view.

05:34.209 --> 05:37.839
Yeah, but it's kind of
in the middle of nowhere.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.677
It's exactly what she texted me.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.766
It is pretty perfect
for a picnic.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.352
Oh, come on, guys. You know
I like to be prepared.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.613
Um, you got any food in there?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.615
She's really late.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.201
Let's give her
a few more minutes.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.793
What?

06:11.955 --> 06:14.049
Whoa.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.466
What is this place?

06:15.625 --> 06:17.468
Come on. Let's check it out.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.588
Uh, why?

06:19.671 --> 06:20.968
Are you kidding?

06:21.131 --> 06:25.227
The Hollywood sign just opened up.
How can we not go inside?

06:26.261 --> 06:28.764
Well, if you put it like that...

06:30.473 --> 06:32.976
What about your aunt Zoe'? Ah!

06:37.314 --> 06:38.486
Now what?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.786
Um, what just happened?

06:46.865 --> 06:48.663
We just got body-scanned.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.087
Cool.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.341
Mmm, guys, I don't think
we should go in.

06:56.499 --> 07:00.254
Come on, what's the worst
that could happen?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.297
Where do you think it goes?

07:09.512 --> 07:10.684
Huh?

07:15.310 --> 07:17.153
Wow.

07:21.858 --> 07:24.031
Just try to blend in.

07:31.993 --> 07:35.998
Wow, that's
a fusion-powered jetpack.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.461
Aah. Whoa!

07:44.047 --> 07:45.219
Whoa.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.640
Zip-line backpack'? Cool!

07:49.844 --> 07:52.723
If I had that backpack,
I'd never walk again.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.354
Whoa.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.985
What a sweet ride.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.024
Oh! Awesome.

08:04.192 --> 08:08.163
- Is that a build-your-own-pizza bar?
- All you can eat.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.364
Huh?

08:09.447 --> 08:10.744
Open 24 hours.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.581
I see you've found
the picnic spot.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.537
Auntie Zoe?

08:15.620 --> 08:17.247
What are you doing here?

08:22.335 --> 08:23.975
Girls, welcome to I-3,

08:24.087 --> 08:27.387
the International Intelligence
and Innovation Agency.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.843
I didn't really bring you
here for a picnic.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.018
I brought you here

08:31.094 --> 08:33.972
because we have a very
important mission for you.

08:36.765 --> 08:41.111
Wait, you're the head of an
international intelligence agency?

08:41.270 --> 08:44.366
And you want us
to become secret agents

08:44.524 --> 08:46.447
'cause why?

08:46.609 --> 08:49.203
Allow me to explain.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.416
Wow.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.964
There have been five robberies
in the last five weeks,

09:00.123 --> 09:02.467
all involving
rare ancient gemstones.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.719
There are three
remaining gems that,

09:04.794 --> 09:07.547
if stolen and
assembled correctly,

09:07.714 --> 09:10.308
can be quite destructive.

09:10.467 --> 09:14.722
Many years ago, the agency developed
a gem-powered EMP weapon.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.232
Electromagnetic
pulse technology.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.644
But it was deemed too dangerous.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.032
We disbanded the program
and destroyed the tech.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.656
But it looks like
it's been reassembled.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.446
It is imperative
we stop the jewel thief

09:31.613 --> 09:34.992
before she steals
the three remaining gems.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.331
Why not just
get them yourselves?

09:37.494 --> 09:40.464
Well, for one, we think the
thief is working for someone.

09:40.622 --> 09:43.626
And you want us to find out who?

09:43.792 --> 09:45.794
How are we going to do that?

09:46.002 --> 09:49.973
As you can see, the suspect in
question is no ordinary thief.

09:50.131 --> 09:53.510
Our cat burglar displays a level
of athletic skill and agility

09:53.593 --> 09:57.143
that has made them
virtually uncatchable.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.182
Believe me, we've tried.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.693
But you girls
could change all that.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.320
Can we just back up for a sec?

10:04.479 --> 10:06.277
How long have you been British?

10:06.356 --> 10:08.484
Really? You're hung up on that?

10:08.650 --> 10:11.119
Uh, yeah. The Auntie Zoe I know

10:11.194 --> 10:13.993
loves to wear tracksuits
and knit cat clothing.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.534
Aunt Zoe is my cover, dear.
This is the real me.

10:18.201 --> 10:21.671
You think we can be secret
agents and catch this thief?

10:21.871 --> 10:23.714
Without question, my dear.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.547
I've been watching you compete
since you were little.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.553
I have never seen
such raw talent.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.389
Acrobatics and agility.

10:31.548 --> 10:32.891
Power and strength.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.722
Precision and focus.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.596
Of course, you'll need
some additional training.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.899
But I have no doubt that you're
exactly what the agency needs

10:41.057 --> 10:43.731
to apprehend the suspect.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.197
<i>Miss Z,
they need you in operations.</i>

10:48.356 --> 10:51.701
Excuse me, girls. This
should only take a moment.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.743
I can't believe it.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.658
We're gonna be secret agents.

10:58.825 --> 11:03.331
Uh, no, we're not. We're gymnasts.
We have curfews.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.896
We still sleep
with stuffed animals.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.004
Speak for yourself.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.091
Guys, seriously. Who doesn't
want to become a spy'?

11:10.253 --> 11:14.349
You get to wear disguises, travel
the world, have amazing adventures.

11:14.507 --> 11:18.262
That may sound great to you, Miss
Always-Up-for-Anything. But me?

11:18.428 --> 11:22.023
I like to avoid potentially
dangerous situations.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.106
Wait. Did you say
"dangerous"? I'm in.

11:25.268 --> 11:26.565
And besides,

11:26.644 --> 11:29.944
we're training for the championship.
We can't do both.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.861
Yes, we can. Teresa, the chance
to do something this cool

11:33.943 --> 11:37.038
and make a real difference
doesn't come along every day.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.240
We have to give it a shot.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.750
Come on. Please?

11:46.122 --> 11:47.419
Fine.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.960
So, what do you girls say?

11:50.585 --> 11:51.802
When do we get started?

11:51.878 --> 11:54.222
I knew I could count on you.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.224
Follow me. I'll get you set up.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.098
As if you don't still sleep
with stuffed animals.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.062
Shh.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.320
So, when do you think the thief
will make their next move?

12:08.478 --> 12:11.106
Based on our
threat-assessment experts' analysis,

12:11.272 --> 12:14.822
we expect the thief's next strike
to occur in the next 24 hours.

12:14.984 --> 12:18.830
So, we need to get you field
ready as quickly <i>as</i> possible.

12:18.988 --> 12:22.993
I'm sorry, but that accent is seriously
freaking me out, Auntie Zoe.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.786
You'll get used to it, dear.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.081
Oh, and while we're at work,

12:27.247 --> 12:31.502
I think it's best to call me
by my agency name, Miss Z.

12:35.672 --> 12:40.018
Now, it's important that we keep
the EMP's resurgence quiet.

12:40.176 --> 12:44.272
Letting the public know would
only spread panic and chaos.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.020
Yeah, we wouldn't
want any of that.

12:47.267 --> 12:51.693
Is that a 10-zettabyte server
housing a threat matrix analyzer?

12:51.854 --> 12:55.859
One hundred zettabytes. It
powers the agency worldwide.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.117
How did you...

12:57.193 --> 12:59.195
Heh. I read a lot
of <i>Wired</i> magazine.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.285
Don't believe
everything you read.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.833
Girls, this is Agent Dunbar.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.915
He will be your
training specialist.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.166
Nice to meet you.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.622
You too... Ah! CAT: Meow.

13:08.788 --> 13:12.042
Aw, so cute.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.960
<i>Hey there, robo-kitty .</i>

13:14.043 --> 13:15.215
What's your name?

13:15.378 --> 13:17.301
Violet. What's yours?

13:17.797 --> 13:20.892
A talking robot cat. Cool.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.894
Violet is actually
one of our tech bots.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.145
Quite indispensable

13:25.221 --> 13:28.816
when it comes to surveillance
and gadgetry in the field.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.528
So, the cat-lady thing
isn't just a cover, huh?

13:35.732 --> 13:38.576
Not entirely. All right, then.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.988
Agent Dunbar,
I believe it's time

13:41.070 --> 13:42.743
to get our new recruits started.

13:43.573 --> 13:47.749
Ahem. Ladies, this way.
There's a lot to see.

13:50.079 --> 13:54.209
Good luck, girls.
And welcome aboard.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.889
And that's our
disguise dispensary.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.889
Look at all the disguises.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.396
We could play
dress-up in there for days.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.277
Heh. Wow. Aah!

14:12.435 --> 14:14.108
Aw.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.945
Ooh. What happens in there?

14:18.107 --> 14:21.737
That is on a need-to-know basis,
and you do not need to know.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.446
Whoa.

14:24.739 --> 14:27.117
We're about to
enter the invention lab.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.373
Every gadget,
weapon and disguise

14:29.452 --> 14:34.128
utilized in the field is created,
tested and perfected in here.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.592
Whoa!

14:39.128 --> 14:41.597
Uh, sorry about that.

14:42.382 --> 14:46.228
Our young inventor apparently
finished robotics school

14:46.302 --> 14:49.272
two years ahead of his class.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.731
Sweet. Hmm.

14:57.897 --> 15:01.993
Hmm. Uh, anybody see my
"World's Best Inventor" mug?

15:02.151 --> 15:06.156
I used it to test out a new invisibility
spray, and now I can't find it.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.450
Lazslo. The new recruits.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.001
Right. I'm sorry.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.670
Ahem.

15:16.833 --> 15:21.509
Uh, hi, welcome. Everyone.
Welcome, everyone.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.845
Lazslo, didn't you have
something for the girls?

15:25.007 --> 15:28.307
Oh yes, of course.
Um, right this way, ladies.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.808
Hey, cool. Did you make this?

15:33.307 --> 15:36.732
Oh, yeah, that's one of
my security prototypes.

15:36.811 --> 15:40.361
I'm having a little trouble getting
it to meet durability standards.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.777
That, and his glide ratio is
only clocking in at 4-to-1.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.413
I was just thinking if I increase
the wingspan, it could change...

15:47.488 --> 15:50.992
Have you considered using a Graphene
metal composite coding for the build?

15:51.200 --> 15:53.453
Hey, that might work.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.624
You know about
this sort of thing?

15:58.207 --> 16:01.962
I've been toying with some
robot designs of my own.

16:04.547 --> 16:07.016
I think you have a fan.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.687
Right.

16:11.846 --> 16:14.395
Did you really
invent all this stuff?

16:14.557 --> 16:16.184
By yourself?

16:16.350 --> 16:18.068
Aren't you, like, 12?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.820
I'm 17, actually.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.732
I sort of had a knack for
biomechanics since I was little.

16:22.899 --> 16:26.620
Huh? Right. But you can't do
anything without a great team.

16:26.694 --> 16:30.699
This is my right-hand man...
Uh, hand.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.752
Speaking of teams...

16:34.827 --> 16:35.919
Right.

16:37.246 --> 16:40.671
This is your tech bot, Percy.

16:45.213 --> 16:50.720
And by "yours," I mean all three of you.
Not just you. Although...

16:50.885 --> 16:52.853
Aw, you are so cute.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.272
Who's a handsome boy?

16:54.430 --> 16:56.524
You are. Yes, you are.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.435
I know. I'm adorable.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.525
Now that we've got
that out of the way,

17:01.604 --> 17:04.278
what do you say
we lose the baby talk, eh?

17:04.523 --> 17:08.028
Huh? Oh, excuse us, uh, sir?

17:08.611 --> 17:12.080
You're sixth-generation
alpha series, aren't you?

17:12.240 --> 17:14.163
Well, if you're free later, I...

17:14.242 --> 17:16.118
Sorry, Whiskers, no can do.

17:16.285 --> 17:20.040
I'm on the clock 24/7, 365.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.084
Come on, Percy.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.795
I could combine your software
debugging appointments.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.589
I don't think so.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.891
All right, ladies.
Playtime's over.

17:30.091 --> 17:33.971
If they make it past training,
I'll send them back for the rest.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.148
Good luck!

17:44.146 --> 17:46.649
I found my invisible mug!

17:49.986 --> 17:52.580
The first rule of
being a secret agent

17:52.780 --> 17:55.659
is tell no one
you are a secret agent.

17:55.741 --> 17:56.867
Yes, sir.

17:56.951 --> 17:58.498
Roger that. Loud and clear.

17:58.661 --> 18:01.756
Would anyone like to take a
wild guess at the second rule?

18:01.956 --> 18:03.253
Uh...

18:03.457 --> 18:07.178
Don't bother. It's the same as the first.
The third rule is...

18:07.336 --> 18:09.009
Don't tell anyone
you're a secret agent.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.305
No.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.975
Know how to defend yourself.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.144
At ease. We'll get to that.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.100
Oh, heh.

18:21.309 --> 18:23.349
First I need
to assess your abilities.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.490
What happened to your body?

18:28.983 --> 18:32.032
I forgot to tell you. There's
a button on your belt

18:32.194 --> 18:33.571
that activates stealth mode.

18:33.654 --> 18:34.951
Awesome.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.366
Cool.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.626
I'm a floating
head, I'm a floating head.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.871
Hey, guys, look,
I totally blend.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.550
We so have to add this to our routine.
Ha, ha.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.046
Aw.

18:50.296 --> 18:53.516
Now, keep in mind
that becoming a great agent

18:53.674 --> 18:56.143
is not merely
about focus and talent.

18:56.344 --> 19:02.192
It is about determination,
concentration, stamina and teamwork.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.359
Not a problem, Agent Dunbar.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.353
Hmm.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.989
We'll see.

19:12.902 --> 19:17.078
Prepare yourselves,
ladies, for your first challenge.

19:17.323 --> 19:20.827
This might look easy,
but trust me, it's not.

19:23.913 --> 19:28.419
Don't worry. There's a device on your
utility belt to the left of your buckle.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.175
Hmm?

19:33.381 --> 19:34.678
Whoa.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.930
Sweet.

19:37.718 --> 19:38.765
Whoa.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.932
- They're rappelling backpacks.
- Hmm.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.652
Cool.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.029
Oh, awesome.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.864
Piece of cake.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.540
Uh, unless the rope breaks

19:59.615 --> 20:01.959
and we instantly
plunge to the ground.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.791
What are the odds
of that happening?

20:03.869 --> 20:05.462
5082-{0-1.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.295
And by instantly,
I'm talking three seconds.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.004
Maybe less, based on body mass,

20:10.084 --> 20:12.132
air temperature
and wind resistance.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.467
You're a real ray of
sunshine, aren't you?

20:14.630 --> 20:19.807
Teresa, you got this. You'll be fine.
Just breathe.

20:25.975 --> 20:30.981
Sure, the cat gets nap mode,
and I get this.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.233
Yes.

20:38.487 --> 20:41.661
Go, Renee! Whoo!

20:41.824 --> 20:42.825
Nice.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.835
- See, I told you. Piece of cake.
- Give me a high five.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.509
Oh.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.260
Save the celebrations, ladies.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.214
You still have two more
challenges and very little time.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.775
To successfully navigate
this laser field,

21:11.937 --> 21:16.363
you must maintain
concentration at all times.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.283
Oh, no.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.534
Ready, team?

21:21.697 --> 21:22.823
Uh...

21:22.907 --> 21:24.033
Unh.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.206
Hmm.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.213
You're up.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.807
Heh.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.510
Renee, you gotta slow down.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.428
Or you could speed up.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.230
Hmm.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.149
Guys, it's all good.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.648
We just gotta make it
through one more section.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.406
Ah! The handspring combo from our
routine should do the trick.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.575
Come on, Teresa.

22:10.746 --> 22:11.963
Yes!

22:12.039 --> 22:14.918
Ah. No alarms triggered.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.093
Hmm.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.183
Sometimes taking
the path less traveled

22:23.259 --> 22:26.729
is the best way to
apprehend a suspect.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.351
This one will be easy.

22:28.514 --> 22:32.519
Your training partners have been
programmed to attack, block

22:32.601 --> 22:35.445
and generally
make your lives difficult.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.781
Easy, huh?

22:51.537 --> 22:53.039
Um...

22:53.247 --> 22:55.215
Let's do this.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.404
Ah! Whoa.

23:45.132 --> 23:48.602
What are the odds of this ever being
the best way to get somewhere?

23:48.761 --> 23:51.605
Slim to absolute zero.

24:14.203 --> 24:15.705
Hmm.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.386
Look out!

24:26.215 --> 24:27.341
Seriously?

24:27.424 --> 24:28.904
Think of it like
playing a video game.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.152
Over here!

24:46.568 --> 24:47.911
Uh...

25:00.749 --> 25:02.171
Whoa.

25:10.843 --> 25:11.935
Whoo-hoo!

25:12.011 --> 25:13.058
Made it!

25:13.262 --> 25:16.516
Hmm, not bad, heh.
Not bad at all.

25:16.682 --> 25:20.277
You can say that again.
High five!

25:29.862 --> 25:31.455
Tough room.

25:31.613 --> 25:34.787
Congratulations, ladies. You're
cleared for your first mission.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.203
You may have only
a small amount of free time.

25:37.369 --> 25:40.748
I suggest you use it wisely.
Go get your gear.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.958
Yeah!

25:43.959 --> 25:45.632
Nicely done. High five! Whoo!

25:47.212 --> 25:50.136
That was amazing!
You were all...

25:50.299 --> 25:52.267
Hi-ya! Hi-ya!

25:52.426 --> 25:54.428
And tumble, tumble, tumble.

25:54.595 --> 25:56.939
And... Huh-ya!

26:01.977 --> 26:04.446
I saw it all on surveillance.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.494
Oh, yeah. Follow me.

26:12.446 --> 26:13.948
Graduation presents!

26:24.917 --> 26:26.294
Whoa. Cool.

26:26.502 --> 26:27.594
For you.

26:27.669 --> 26:28.670
Huh?

26:31.256 --> 26:34.430
Uh, not just you. All of you.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.812
Which obviously includes you.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.858
Uh, shall we?

26:42.643 --> 26:45.863
Wow. Whoa, cool.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.031
Careful with that.

26:48.190 --> 26:51.034
Seriously?
I'm a girl. It's lip gloss.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.282
Oops, sorry.

26:56.365 --> 26:57.833
Lip gloss, ha-ha-ha...

26:57.991 --> 27:00.210
Giggle, ha-ha-ha...

27:00.369 --> 27:02.167
Taser.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.878
I am so keeping this.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.969
Here. Try this one. It's safer

27:13.173 --> 27:14.550
for me.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.055
Hmm?

27:20.806 --> 27:22.900
Whoa.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.982
A mini-scanner. Ah!

27:26.145 --> 27:29.069
With infrared heat signatures!

27:31.066 --> 27:33.410
What's so special about this?

27:33.569 --> 27:36.197
Ooh, soft.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.204
What? Ls it not my color?
Ha, ha.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.079
Mmm, something like that.

27:44.246 --> 27:47.216
Uh, you might
wanna look in a mirror.

27:49.585 --> 27:53.886
Uh, no offense, Lazslo, but
this thing's adjustable, right?

27:54.089 --> 27:56.592
Yeah, sure.
That's just the prototype.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.936
Hmm.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.269
Phew.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.109
Huh?

28:12.065 --> 28:15.615
Oh. A stick. Cool.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.283
Still working on that, too?

28:17.529 --> 28:19.247
Not just a stick.

28:19.406 --> 28:22.910
A Gymnastic Launching
Innovative Spy Stick.

28:23.285 --> 28:24.537
<i>GLISS.</i>

28:24.703 --> 28:28.082
Oh. A super-high-tech,
weird-sounding stick.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.626
I don't know.
I think it sounds cool.

28:30.792 --> 28:32.794
Allow me to demonstrate.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.050
You're gonna love this.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.434
Stylish.

28:42.596 --> 28:46.726
The GLISS and the bracelet work together.
Here, give it a try.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.065
Whoa.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.942
This is cool.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.819
Wow. Whoa.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.326
Huh.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.243
So cool.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.124
Whoa. Ah!

29:06.328 --> 29:07.568
If you're wearing the bracelet,

29:07.621 --> 29:09.498
the GLISS will always
come back to you.

29:10.123 --> 29:11.466
Really?

29:15.963 --> 29:17.510
Awesome.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.346
Thanks, Lazslo.

29:19.508 --> 29:22.352
It does more the more
you use it, too.

29:22.970 --> 29:25.849
And you can send it messages
from these Keypad Nails.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.517
Whoa. Keypad Nails?

29:28.684 --> 29:30.311
Give them a try.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.697
Hey, Barbie. Incoming.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.496
Cool.

29:45.701 --> 29:48.545
Huh. I wonder if it would work
with synaptic interfacing.

29:48.704 --> 29:51.207
That's a great idea.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.550
You're so amazing.

29:53.709 --> 29:56.303
Uh, you are all amazing,
heh, heh.

29:56.461 --> 29:59.055
Thank you. Yeah, thanks
so much, Lazslo.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.182
Seriously. Wait.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.225
There's more.

30:44.426 --> 30:45.427
Huh?

30:54.186 --> 30:55.904
Whoa.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.780
Sweet, am I right?

31:02.277 --> 31:03.278
He's right.

31:03.528 --> 31:04.871
Amazing.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.953
They're yours. Surprise!

31:08.533 --> 31:09.785
Ours? What?

31:09.951 --> 31:11.294
No way.

31:11.453 --> 31:14.548
These babies are loaded.
Titanium-reinforced body.

31:14.748 --> 31:18.127
Holographic view screen.
Night-vision windshield.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.221
A sparkle-bomb launcher
for a diversion

31:21.421 --> 31:23.924
and a sidecar
for your favorite tech bot.

31:24.091 --> 31:25.308
That would be me.

31:25.467 --> 31:28.971
Okay. You're serious?
This is for us?

31:29.221 --> 31:32.475
Every great secret agent
needs a sweet ride.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.444
They're Hairdo Helmets.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.901
Not only do these babies
protect your head,

31:38.980 --> 31:40.903
they protect you
from helmet hair.

31:41.108 --> 31:43.486
Dude, I don't know
how you come up with all this,

31:43.568 --> 31:45.161
but I like it.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.322
You girls have
ridden before, right?

31:47.489 --> 31:49.082
- Of course.
- I'm a pro.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.584
Just like riding a bike!

31:53.286 --> 31:54.833
Whoa.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.460
Ah!

31:56.665 --> 31:59.965
Aah! Uh, heh-heh-heh.

32:00.127 --> 32:02.926
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:04.506 --> 32:05.974
Careful out there!

32:06.133 --> 32:07.760
Thanks, Lazslo!

32:07.843 --> 32:09.095
Whoa.

32:12.347 --> 32:16.102
Ugh. I hate to say it,
but Dunbar was right.

32:16.309 --> 32:19.108
Being a secret agent
isn't as easy as it looks.

32:19.271 --> 32:23.367
Ugh, I know.
Even my eyelashes are tired.

32:23.608 --> 32:26.703
Ugh, good thing there's no
homework in secret-agent school.

32:26.862 --> 32:28.614
Secret-agent school?

32:28.780 --> 32:30.453
Does that actually exist?

32:30.532 --> 32:32.705
'Cause I would totally go there.

32:32.868 --> 32:34.040
Me, too!

32:34.119 --> 32:35.211
Right? Ha, ha.

32:35.370 --> 32:36.713
I mean, who wouldn't?

32:36.872 --> 32:39.625
Heh, heh, you know,
if there was such a thing.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.885
Which there absolutely isn't.

32:42.043 --> 32:44.387
No, there is not.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.891
Uh...

32:50.469 --> 32:52.016
Hey, Chelsea, Mila,

32:52.220 --> 32:55.895
would you guys mind grabbing our hoops
from the equipment room while we warm up?

32:56.057 --> 32:57.058
Sure.

32:59.728 --> 33:03.699
Whew. My bad. I did not
see them behind us.

33:05.358 --> 33:08.077
Spy Squad. It's go <i>time.</i>

33:08.320 --> 33:09.572
Ah! Sweet.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.414
Let's roll.

33:15.744 --> 33:18.714
Huh? Where'd they go?

33:24.252 --> 33:25.845
Spy Squad is en route.

33:25.921 --> 33:26.922
<i>Good.</i>

33:27.380 --> 33:30.429
<i>Satellite surveillance has just
detected a security breach</i>

33:30.592 --> 33:34.222
<i>inside the penthouse owned
by billionaire Griffin Pitts.</i>

33:34.429 --> 33:36.431
Pulling up
building schematics now.

33:38.934 --> 33:41.687
What makes you think our
jewel thief is behind this break-in?

33:41.853 --> 33:44.072
<i>Mr. Pitts is also
one of the world's</i>

33:44.147 --> 33:46.024
<i>biggest collectors
of art and gems.</i>

33:46.191 --> 33:48.114
<i>Percy will meet you on scene.</i>

33:48.276 --> 33:52.122
<i>Now, agents, I must remind you.
This is a covert operation.</i>

33:52.280 --> 33:55.124
<i>Don't trigger any alarms
and leave no trace.</i>

33:55.283 --> 33:58.878
<i>Remember your training,
and make me proud.</i>

34:08.420 --> 34:10.264
About time you ladies got here.

34:10.422 --> 34:11.766
Hey, Percy.

34:11.841 --> 34:14.560
Wow, love these Hairdo Helmets.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.973
Come on, the chase is my
favorite part of the job.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.271
Let's do this.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.603
Activate stealth mode.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.949
Proceed with caution.

34:38.659 --> 34:42.085
Hmm, no signs of forced entry.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.755
Maybe it was a false alarm.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.009
Accessing security system.

34:48.168 --> 34:49.762
Oops.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.507
Let me save you the trouble.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.344
I'm up here,
and you're too late.

34:56.511 --> 35:01.768
But if it makes you feel any better,
love the outfits. Ha-ha-ha.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.686
Too bad you don't have the
jewels to go with them.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.698
No, but we're about to.

35:19.701 --> 35:25.003
If that's as fast as you can go,
you might as well give up now.

35:30.879 --> 35:33.553
Percy, see if you can
deactivate the lasers

35:33.798 --> 35:36.051
while we take care of her.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.844
I'm on it.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.025
Whew.

35:48.229 --> 35:50.231
Teresa! Incoming! Huh?

35:50.398 --> 35:51.741
Here I come!

35:53.485 --> 35:54.657
Renee! Look out!

35:54.736 --> 35:56.158
Whoa!

36:01.576 --> 36:03.578
Heh, heh, heh. BARBIE: Hey!

36:03.745 --> 36:07.545
Sure you don't wanna stop and
wait for your little friends?

36:20.011 --> 36:22.434
Ah, where is it? Where is it?

36:27.435 --> 36:28.687
Oh, ladies.

36:29.104 --> 36:30.526
Oh, no!

36:33.441 --> 36:34.909
Huh?

36:36.444 --> 36:40.119
Laser frequency located
and terminated.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.118
You're all mine now.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.808
Yoo-hoo!

37:00.969 --> 37:02.642
UP 'there!

37:11.271 --> 37:12.773
Huh?

37:16.317 --> 37:18.490
How did we lose her?

37:18.653 --> 37:19.779
There!

37:23.742 --> 37:25.995
Come on. Chase me already.

37:26.494 --> 37:27.791
Let's go.

37:27.954 --> 37:29.331
Are you kidding me?

37:29.497 --> 37:31.625
Come on,
this is our moment to shine.

37:31.791 --> 37:34.670
Catch the thief, get the
gem, save the world.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.473
Okay.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.279
Oh, no. PERCY: Grr.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.621
Heh, heh, heh. RENEE: You
gotta stop looking down.

38:02.155 --> 38:03.873
I can't.

38:04.949 --> 38:07.998
Aw, trouble in paradise?

38:10.997 --> 38:12.795
Pressure's on.
What you gonna do?

38:12.874 --> 38:15.468
Play it safe
or try and catch me?

38:16.711 --> 38:19.464
Hmm, this is why I work alone.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.633
You can do this, T.

38:22.884 --> 38:24.511
It's just like we practiced.

38:27.639 --> 38:30.233
Hurry! She's getting away!

38:30.391 --> 38:32.519
Ugh, and I'm out of rope.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.734
Take a deep breath.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.739
Ready? Mmm-hmm.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.503
Aah! Oh, no!

38:57.085 --> 38:59.759
Wish I could stay and hang,
but you know me.

38:59.921 --> 39:02.765
Places to go, things to steal.

39:13.393 --> 39:16.613
Failing one mission isn't the
end of the world, girls.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.274
But the higher-ups aren't
Known for their patience.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.944
Especially when it comes
to losing the Firestorm Ruby.

39:23.111 --> 39:24.784
Don't worry, Percy. Oh!

39:24.946 --> 39:28.450
You know, they really ought to
have you wear a bell or something.

39:30.785 --> 39:32.378
Miss Z, it was totally my fault.

39:32.453 --> 39:35.798
The team did great.
I'm the one who messed up.

39:36.791 --> 39:42.639
Let's just chalk it up to beginner
nerves and move forward. Shall we?

39:43.798 --> 39:47.769
Tomorrow night, the National Museum
is holding an invitation-only gala

39:47.927 --> 39:50.271
for its exhibition
of ancient gemstones.

39:50.430 --> 39:52.728
To ensure
the highest level of secrecy,

39:52.807 --> 39:55.435
you'll need to infiltrate
the event undercover.

39:55.602 --> 39:57.946
I had Lazslo
pull some options for you.

39:58.479 --> 40:01.323
You can go see him now.
Dismissed.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.659
Undercover?

40:03.818 --> 40:06.037
That means disguises.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.411
Ooh, these brushes are soft.

40:12.493 --> 40:13.619
Told you.

40:13.828 --> 40:15.330
Oh, let me try.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.422
Ooh, super soft.

40:20.501 --> 40:21.673
Huh?

40:23.004 --> 40:24.130
What?

40:24.339 --> 40:27.513
Uh, even I don't wanna see
that much of me.

40:27.675 --> 40:29.677
Try these instead.

41:36.703 --> 41:37.750
Thanks, Lazslo.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.376
These'll be great for tonight.

41:39.580 --> 41:40.877
You're welcome.

41:41.040 --> 41:44.169
I mean, you're all welcome.
Anytime.

41:44.377 --> 41:46.300
Ooh, and perfume.

41:46.379 --> 41:47.471
Wait!

41:47.547 --> 41:49.675
That's not perfume. That's...

41:52.844 --> 41:56.565
A sparkle bomb.
Great for distractions.

41:57.932 --> 42:00.230
I'll take a few of these.

42:02.687 --> 42:04.064
You coming? Heh.

42:05.273 --> 42:07.275
See you. Good luck tonight.

42:07.442 --> 42:09.695
Hey! You know what would
go great with these?

42:09.861 --> 42:11.113
Let me guess.

42:11.279 --> 42:14.078
Pizza? Yep. You guys in?

42:15.033 --> 42:17.411
Why not? Uh, you guys go ahead.

42:17.618 --> 42:18.619
I'll meet you later.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.247
I'm gonna practice
with my GLISS.

42:20.329 --> 42:21.626
Okay, see you later.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.791
We'll save you a slice.

42:36.554 --> 42:37.931
Hmm.

42:50.902 --> 42:52.119
Hmm.

42:54.405 --> 42:55.748
Whoa.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.495
Huh? Unh!

43:06.125 --> 43:07.126
Yes!

43:29.148 --> 43:30.616
You're getting
pretty good with that.

43:30.691 --> 43:32.034
I'm just playing around.

43:32.193 --> 43:36.448
I get it. It's about enjoying
yourself, not being perfect.

43:37.198 --> 43:38.950
I guess so.

43:39.117 --> 43:40.619
Doing something you enjoy

43:40.701 --> 43:43.204
is always a good way
to get out of your head.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.798
You can control it,
you know'? Your mind.

43:45.873 --> 43:48.217
Like you control the GLISS.

43:49.377 --> 43:50.720
What do you mean?

43:51.379 --> 43:54.223
Have you ever tried visualizing?

43:54.382 --> 43:57.511
It's a way to train your brain
like you train your body.

43:57.677 --> 44:00.100
Before you do
whatever you're trying to do,

44:00.179 --> 44:02.022
you picture yourself
accomplishing it.

44:02.181 --> 44:06.357
Then you do. See it, then be it.

44:06.561 --> 44:07.653
Hmm.

44:08.396 --> 44:10.194
Why don't you go get some rest?

44:10.273 --> 44:12.071
You have a big
night ahead of you.

44:25.746 --> 44:28.750
I'll check in with you on my
comm link when I'm in position.

44:28.916 --> 44:31.715
Okay, Percy.
We'll see you inside.

44:36.424 --> 44:38.222
Let's go, girls.

44:42.555 --> 44:43.852
You are late.

44:45.266 --> 44:49.396
Ahh, don't tell me the academy
sent me trainees again.

44:49.604 --> 44:51.447
No, sir. We're fully trained.

44:53.274 --> 44:58.747
Fine. Give me 350 shrimp
and 200 mini egg rolls.

44:59.530 --> 45:00.531
Now.

45:00.615 --> 45:01.741
<i>Oui, chef.</i>

45:06.913 --> 45:07.880
Order up.

45:07.955 --> 45:09.628
Remember, this is
just our cover.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.884
Yeah, we don't
actually have to do it.

45:11.959 --> 45:14.053
I don't hear the plating.

45:14.212 --> 45:15.429
Oh, yes, we do.

45:15.922 --> 45:19.051
A disguise
is more than just an outfit.

45:19.217 --> 45:22.767
You have to feel the chef.
Be the chef.

45:24.305 --> 45:25.306
Whoa. Aah!

45:29.769 --> 45:31.112
Sorry.

45:37.818 --> 45:39.058
I got you. Whoa!

45:39.153 --> 45:40.405
Whoa!

45:40.571 --> 45:41.914
Ta-da.

45:48.621 --> 45:50.123
Oh, no.

45:54.919 --> 45:58.014
<i>I'm in position.
You're clear for phase two.</i>

45:58.172 --> 45:59.173
Copy that.

46:02.343 --> 46:06.348
What have you done to my Kitchen?
What... Grr.

46:06.514 --> 46:08.482
Quick, this way.

46:25.491 --> 46:26.993
You guys look stunning.

46:27.159 --> 46:29.503
You look
pretty amazing yourself, Barbie.

46:29.662 --> 46:31.164
Thanks.

46:44.010 --> 46:46.513
I don't see anything
suspicious. Do you?

46:48.389 --> 46:50.562
<i>We have a breach.
Northwest corner.</i>

46:50.725 --> 46:53.023
Copy that. We're on our way.

46:58.899 --> 47:01.243
Northwest corner, this way.

47:10.369 --> 47:11.837
False alarm, maybe?

47:11.912 --> 47:13.585
Could be an electrical short.

47:13.748 --> 47:15.716
Looks like the security
system's been hacked.

47:15.875 --> 47:19.220
Percy, run a scan of the
security system. Percy?

47:20.713 --> 47:22.431
His frequency
has been scrambled.

47:22.590 --> 47:24.092
It was just a trick
to draw us away

47:24.175 --> 47:27.099
from the gem. Quick, downstairs.

47:27.928 --> 47:30.772
Access the museum server and
put the building on lockdown.

47:31.015 --> 47:32.688
Copy that.

47:34.769 --> 47:36.066
Everyone's gone.

47:36.270 --> 47:39.194
Run a thermal scan.
See if we're really alone.

47:45.196 --> 47:47.073
We have company.

47:47.239 --> 47:49.537
And I have a shiny new toy.

47:49.700 --> 47:52.078
That's what happens
when you're fashionably late.

47:52.161 --> 47:53.788
You miss all the fun.

47:54.038 --> 47:55.130
The gem!

47:59.710 --> 48:01.963
Comm links are down.
Did you find the...

48:02.129 --> 48:03.756
Up there.

48:04.715 --> 48:06.467
How does she keep beating us?

48:06.634 --> 48:09.478
I don't know,
but it's about to stop.

48:10.971 --> 48:12.814
Hi-ya!

48:14.767 --> 48:16.735
Oh, man, I hate heights.

48:16.894 --> 48:20.319
You're going to nail it.
Let's do this.

48:23.734 --> 48:26.453
Cool. Hey, <i>I</i> did it. <i>I</i> did it!

48:27.988 --> 48:32.459
Must be so frustrating
to always be one step behind.

48:34.829 --> 48:36.456
No way. Was that a...

48:36.622 --> 48:38.795
Triple Arabian flip?

48:44.630 --> 48:45.756
Careful, sweetheart.

48:45.923 --> 48:49.598
Don't forget what happened last
time you tried to keep up with me.

48:50.469 --> 48:52.642
What did Auntie Zoe say?

48:52.805 --> 48:55.604
"See it, then be it."

48:55.766 --> 48:58.269
Ugh, get it together, Barbie.

49:01.772 --> 49:02.944
Whoa.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.988
Whoa! Aah!

49:18.038 --> 49:19.540
Ha, ha, got you.

49:19.790 --> 49:24.045
Heh, so close and yet so far.

49:26.547 --> 49:30.222
We lost her. Again.

49:34.388 --> 49:37.688
We just received new intel that
the final gem has been targeted.

49:37.850 --> 49:41.070
Unfortunately, you won't be
the ones to retrieve it.

49:41.228 --> 49:42.821
It's true.

49:43.022 --> 49:45.024
The director of
National Intelligence

49:45.107 --> 49:47.075
has decided to
terminate your training.

49:47.234 --> 49:48.736
What? Really? Huh?

49:48.903 --> 49:50.997
The stakes are
just too high now.

49:51.155 --> 49:53.704
If the thief gets to the last
remaining gem before we do,

49:53.866 --> 49:56.119
not only do we lose the gem,

49:56.202 --> 49:58.421
we lose the key to
finding the EMP weapon.

49:59.747 --> 50:02.751
So, what are you saying?
We're out?

50:02.917 --> 50:04.669
As in fired?

50:04.752 --> 50:06.595
Like, permanently?

50:06.837 --> 50:11.718
Girls, you know I love you.
But it's out of my hands now.

50:11.926 --> 50:13.269
I'm sorry.

50:13.427 --> 50:17.557
I wish things had turned out differently.
We all do.

50:34.281 --> 50:36.033
I'll miss you.

50:36.200 --> 50:40.046
Uh, not just you. All of you.

50:43.707 --> 50:46.301
All right, then.
Good work. See you.

50:48.712 --> 50:50.214
Should we...

50:50.297 --> 50:52.800
Oh. I'll go.

50:54.593 --> 50:57.096
You don't have to
put on an act, Percy.

50:57.179 --> 50:58.476
I'm a professional, darling.

50:58.639 --> 51:02.234
This sort of thing comes with the
territory. It's no big deal.

51:04.979 --> 51:08.404
I'm gonna miss them so much.

51:12.736 --> 51:15.580
You know what? I'm not
supposed to do this,

51:15.739 --> 51:17.241
but why don't you keep your gear

51:17.324 --> 51:19.793
for one more day and
bring it back tomorrow?

51:19.994 --> 51:21.996
Really? You'd really do that?

51:22.162 --> 51:23.960
I'd do anything for you.

51:24.164 --> 51:25.666
All of you.

51:25.916 --> 51:27.509
Aw.

51:30.504 --> 51:32.848
Cool, so, it's a date.

51:33.132 --> 51:35.510
I mean, I'll see you tomorrow.

51:35.676 --> 51:38.805
I'll see you all tomorrow.

51:45.853 --> 51:48.697
All right, who's ready
to put yesterday behind us?

51:48.939 --> 51:50.532
Yeah, I guess so.

51:51.108 --> 51:52.985
I'm gonna miss that
free pizza, though.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.461
You guys okay?

52:02.620 --> 52:04.372
Yeah. Hey, Barbie.

52:04.538 --> 52:07.337
I can't believe
I keep messing that up.

52:07.416 --> 52:08.793
Again.

52:09.001 --> 52:12.847
Every time I get to this
one part, I just... Ugh.

52:13.005 --> 52:14.882
I don't know how to explain it.

52:15.049 --> 52:16.301
You get in your head?

52:16.383 --> 52:18.636
Get scared you're gonna mess
up and let everyone down?

52:18.719 --> 52:21.643
Then you do? Yeah.
How did you know?

52:21.805 --> 52:23.307
Lucky guess.

52:23.515 --> 52:25.859
Must be a sister thing.

52:26.060 --> 52:27.937
It's okay to make mistakes.

52:28.020 --> 52:30.068
No one expects
you to be perfect.

52:30.230 --> 52:33.484
That's one of the cool things
about being part of a team.

52:33.692 --> 52:35.820
It's not up to one person.

52:35.986 --> 52:37.238
What do you mean?

52:37.529 --> 52:39.247
You support your team, right?

52:39.490 --> 52:40.491
Yeah.

52:40.699 --> 52:43.077
Well, they're there
to support you, too.

52:43.327 --> 52:44.419
No matter what.

52:44.578 --> 52:46.080
Like family.

52:46.246 --> 52:52.094
Wow. I was way off. I thought you
were mad at me or something.

52:52.252 --> 52:54.380
What? No, not at all.

52:54.546 --> 52:57.265
Then how come you've been
so secretive lately, Barbie'?

52:57.424 --> 53:00.394
You keep disappearing and stuff.

53:00.552 --> 53:02.020
I'm sorry, Chels.

53:02.096 --> 53:05.396
I wish I could share everything
with you, but I can't right now.

53:05.599 --> 53:07.601
When I can, I will. Okay?

53:07.685 --> 53:09.107
Mmm-hmm.

53:10.938 --> 53:13.236
How about we work
on that round-off?

53:18.946 --> 53:21.369
Perfect. Ready to
try on your own'?

53:21.532 --> 53:23.876
Can we practice one more time?

53:25.077 --> 53:27.830
See if this works.
Next time you get nervous

53:27.913 --> 53:31.634
try to picture yourself doing the
move exactly the way you want to.

53:31.792 --> 53:32.793
Then do it.

53:33.043 --> 53:35.091
See it, then be it.

53:35.254 --> 53:37.256
I'll try.

53:45.097 --> 53:46.314
It worked!

53:46.557 --> 53:47.683
Thattagirl.

53:47.766 --> 53:49.313
All right, Chelsea!

53:49.435 --> 53:53.485
Thanks, Barbie.
That was awesome advice.

53:53.731 --> 53:56.234
<i>Yeah,</i> I <i>guess it was.</i>

54:05.576 --> 54:07.670
Was that a Triple Arabian?

54:09.246 --> 54:11.749
I don't know why you try
and keep up with me.

54:11.957 --> 54:13.004
What did you say?

54:13.167 --> 54:16.637
I don't know why you try
and keep up with me.

54:17.796 --> 54:21.266
Took me a second without your
catsuit and stolen gems.

54:21.467 --> 54:22.844
So, you found me.

54:23.677 --> 54:28.103
Too bad finding and catching
aren't the same thing.

54:29.767 --> 54:31.189
Patricia is the thief.

54:31.685 --> 54:33.938
Patricia is the thief?

54:36.440 --> 54:38.033
Let's go. Wait.

54:38.650 --> 54:41.028
We're not secret agents
anymore, remember?

54:41.195 --> 54:42.367
We got fired.

54:42.446 --> 54:43.948
This is about
doing the right thing.

54:44.031 --> 54:47.410
That's why we became agents in the
first place, isn't it? Come on.

54:53.290 --> 54:54.542
Should we...

54:54.625 --> 54:55.842
Follow them?

54:56.001 --> 54:58.971
Nah. She'll tell me
when she's ready.

55:02.216 --> 55:03.763
No luck reaching Agent Dunbar.

55:03.842 --> 55:05.389
I couldn't get Auntie Z either.

55:05.552 --> 55:06.644
Same with Lazslo.

55:06.845 --> 55:09.223
We'll just have
to do it on our own.

55:12.518 --> 55:14.646
Approaching suspect now.

55:15.229 --> 55:16.697
Gotcha.

55:51.181 --> 55:52.603
Cool.

55:53.684 --> 55:55.857
Launching sparkle bomb.

56:00.941 --> 56:03.785
Whoops.
Didn't think this through.

56:25.591 --> 56:27.559
Argh. We lost her.

56:27.634 --> 56:29.011
Again.

56:29.094 --> 56:32.189
No, we didn't.
I placed a tracker on her.

56:32.264 --> 56:33.982
Cool.

56:35.934 --> 56:39.313
Wait, why would Patricia
be going to headquarters?

56:39.479 --> 56:41.982
Are you sure your
tracker is calibrated?

56:42.149 --> 56:44.117
Only one way to find out.

56:45.652 --> 56:47.780
Come on, I know a shortcut.

57:07.841 --> 57:09.935
Ah! Go, go. go.-

57:30.197 --> 57:32.370
They already removed
our security clearance.

57:32.532 --> 57:33.579
Now what?

57:33.659 --> 57:34.751
Hmm.

57:36.870 --> 57:39.043
Arf. I say...

57:39.206 --> 57:40.207
Percy!

57:40.457 --> 57:44.712
Just a normal dog heading
back in from a walk, heh.

57:50.884 --> 57:52.852
We go stealth.

58:06.900 --> 58:08.823
She's in the off-limits sector.

58:08.902 --> 58:10.502
We'll never
get through that door.

58:10.529 --> 58:11.576
Hmm.

58:12.406 --> 58:14.079
Quick. Up there.

58:29.589 --> 58:32.684
Renee, you're
the loudest crawler I know.

58:32.759 --> 58:34.432
Can you whisper any louder?

58:34.594 --> 58:36.767
Guys, we have to keep it down.

58:39.766 --> 58:42.235
I still don't get
why she'd be here.

58:42.310 --> 58:44.438
Maybe this will help.

58:45.897 --> 58:47.774
It's another gift.

58:52.946 --> 58:54.448
It's the last gem.

59:01.705 --> 59:03.753
Sorry, that's mine.

59:05.751 --> 59:07.128
Shh.

59:07.377 --> 59:08.378
Hello?

59:08.462 --> 59:10.635
Teresa? It's me. Lazslo.

59:10.881 --> 59:14.055
<i>From the agency.
I saw you called.</i>

59:14.885 --> 59:17.479
I got your gem,
but those girls are onto me.

59:17.637 --> 59:20.060
And I'd be careful
if I were you.

59:20.640 --> 59:23.564
You've certainly proven
your loyalty, Patricia.

59:25.145 --> 59:27.739
Agent Dunbar? No.

59:27.898 --> 59:30.447
It's Lazslo!

59:37.115 --> 59:38.332
Who's there?

59:38.617 --> 59:39.664
Lazslo.

59:39.743 --> 59:42.496
Shh. Lazslo, we know it's you.

59:45.582 --> 59:47.926
<i>Yeah, sure, I knew you did.</i>

59:50.504 --> 59:51.630
<i>I was just, you know,
making sure that...</i>

59:51.713 --> 59:52.839
Aah!

59:55.425 --> 59:57.723
<i>Send backup!
Off-limits room! Stat!</i>

59:57.803 --> 59:58.895
Aah!

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.315
Ladies, I'm glad you're here.

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:14.031
You're about to
learn another important lesson.

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:17.326
Treat your team right, or
they will steal your secrets

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:18.957
and use them against you.

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:21.034
What did the agency
ever do to you?

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:25.123
I was in line to be the head of
this agency, but they overlooked me

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:26.957
for your precious Aunt Zoe.

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:29.377
So, you stole the plans
to the EMP weapon.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.879
And had her steal the
gems to power it. Hmm.

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:35.049
To think, I looked
up to you, Patricia.

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:36.717
Eh.

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:40.683
You know, being the bad guy is
even more fun than I expected.

01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:44.817
After I use the EMP weapon to
destroy the agency's main server,

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:46.814
I'll blame it all on Miss Z.

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:49.362
You can't blame her.
That's so unfair.

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:51.361
Oh, but I can.

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:53.070
But think about how much
destruction you'll cause.

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:54.402
I have.

01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:58.038
If it's <i>as</i> brutal as I predict,
I may even go global with it.

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:01.416
Who needs to run an agency
when you can rule the world?

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:06.834
Would you like to do the honors?

01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:10.258
Uh, yeah, about that, I just
wanted to make some extra cash.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:14.175
I'm not really into the whole
world-domination thing.

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:16.594
Good luck with that, though.

01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:17.928
Nice try.

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:22.931
But you have to pick a side.
Mine or theirs?

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:24.773
I pick

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:26.358
mine.

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:34.024
Her loss.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:37.411
Time to initiate phase one.

01:01:37.569 --> 01:01:39.446
You, come with me.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:41.365
You, watch them.

01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:46.420
<i>All employees proceed to
safe room. This is not a drill.</i>

01:01:55.879 --> 01:02:00.134
<i>All employees proceed to safe room.
This is not</i> a <i>drill.</i>

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.723
Renee, Teresa.

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.481
Hey, what do you
feed a hungry robot?

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:09.817
Megabytes. Get it?

01:02:11.937 --> 01:02:15.817
<i>All employees proceed to
safe room. This is not a drill.</i>

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:18.785
Think you can handle the rest?

01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:20.070
We got this.

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:23.282
Once they're under control,
try and reprogram them.

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.834
I've got Dunbar.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:33.592
<i>All employees proceed to
safe room. This is not a drill.</i>

01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:42.221
Hey, Dunbar.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.678
Grr. Get her.

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:49.479
<i>All employees proceed to
safe room. This is not a drill.</i>

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:57.323
<i>All employees...</i>

01:03:00.485 --> 01:03:02.863
Time for phase two.

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:17.298
How did you get out?

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:26.352
Did you really think
you could stop me?

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:43.404
Guess what. It's sparkle time.

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.711
Don't even think about moving.

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:56.670
Huh? She said don't move.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.517
You'll never get
away with this, Dunbar.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:17.275
I already have, Barbie.

01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:22.109
So young. So foolish.

01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:26.454
Not so fast, Dunbar. Huh?

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:30.951
Oh, Patricia, you disappoint me.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:33.961
Then you're really
gonna hate this.

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:42.922
Nice. Why the sudden
team spirit?

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:47.100
Let's just say having people who
care might not be the worst thing.

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:51.221
Come on, you. You're next.

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:53.436
Lazslo, catch.

01:04:56.768 --> 01:04:58.896
This one's ready.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:03.488
Got it. We have to move faster.
Barbie's on her own.

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:16.167
The GLISS!

01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:22.678
Heh, heh. Now, time to
get this party started.

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:25.923
You'll never get away
with this on my watch.

01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:27.257
You're too late.

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:32.350
Did you really think I wouldn't
figure it out, Agent Dunbar?

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:33.767
Hmm.

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:40.103
Seriously, who are you?

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.863
Hmm, you'll get
used to it, dear.

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:55.369
I just started
the countdown sequence.

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:59.373
We have to deactivate the weapon
before it destroys the server.

01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:01.166
We got these metal heads.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:21.064
Barbie.

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:42.670
<i>See it, then be it.</i>

01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:06.276
Huh?

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:15.578
You're too late!

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:25.959
It's the EMP.
It's jamming the signals.

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:34.926
Oh, no.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.722
Not Percy and Violet!

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:43.564
The EMP weapon was never designed to
be turned off once it's been started.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.899
If we can detach at least
one of these gems,

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:47.731
we can stop
this thing from going off.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:53.320
It seems to be held
by an electromagnetic field.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.288
Barbie, try the GLISS.

01:08:17.468 --> 01:08:18.560
Meow.

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:19.683
I say!

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:21.981
Percy!

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:26.481
Boys, you know what to do.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.535
Hey!

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.029
What are you doing?

01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:41.283
You're supposed
to be on my side.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:43.953
I guess you wanted to be
part of a team after all.

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:48.006
Too bad you chose the wrong one.

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:51.465
You haven't seen
the last of Agent Dunbar.

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:53.888
You'll see. Mark my words!

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:56.550
Nice work, girls. Put it there.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:58.642
Don't mess with the Spy Squad.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.348
Whoo!

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:03.390
Seems like there's something to
this teamwork thing after all.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.893
Seems that way, doesn't it?

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:11.689
You all should be
proud of yourselves.

01:09:11.856 --> 01:09:14.904
What you did today was
nothing short of remarkable.

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:16.866
Your friend Patricia is lucky.

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:18.787
If you hadn't vouched for her,

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:21.742
she'd have gotten a lot
more than probation.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.745
Guys, it's time.

01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:27.663
Aunt Zoe, we gotta bounce.

01:09:30.249 --> 01:09:33.093
I look forward to our
next mission together.

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:34.845
We'll be in touch.

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.506
I'll miss you.

01:09:36.673 --> 01:09:38.345
And by "you," I mean...

01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:40.768
All of us. We know, Lazslo.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.939
Uh, Teresa, I'll call you.

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:46.687
Good luck at the meet.

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:50.944
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.943
<i>welcome to the championships.</i>

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:02.074
Guys, whatever happens today,
however things go,

01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:05.626
I already feel like I've
won with you as my team.

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:08.621
Thanks for reminding me that
that's what it's really about.

01:10:08.788 --> 01:10:10.210
Aw.

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:14.969
We're still gonna
try and win though, right?

01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:19.929
Is that what you... No, actually,
that is worth clarifying.

01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:22.435
Uh, yeah,
we're going for the win.

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:23.807
Yes!

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:26.060
Uh...

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:29.980
Hey, guys. Good luck out there.

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:33.779
Thanks.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.324
<i>Athletes, take your places.</i>

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:38.826
<i>The competition
will begin momentarily.</i>

01:10:38.985 --> 01:10:40.828
Go, team, go!

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:42.204

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.406

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:45.246
You guys are the best.

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:46.409
Thanks, you guys.

01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:48.165
Hey, Aunt Zoe.

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:52.127
Remember
your training and make me proud.

01:10:58.504 --> 01:10:59.756
Go, Barbie! Whoo!

01:10:59.839 --> 01:11:01.011
Whoo!

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:33.332
See it, then be it.

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:06.405
Welcome <i>back,</i> agents-
