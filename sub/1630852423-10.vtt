00:40.999 --> 00:42.751
Guys, tell me now about Michael.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.171
It got real to me.

00:46.254 --> 00:48.298
Basically, this is what happened was like…

00:48.381 --> 00:50.633
Michael's potentially moving to LA.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.885
I'm staying here.

00:51.968 --> 00:53.386
And that's why it felt real

00:53.470 --> 00:55.221
because I think I would want to stay here.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.598
And I just started crying.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.601
I didn't even notice.

00:59.684 --> 01:03.563
We have built this relationship
based off how close we've gotten.

01:04.564 --> 01:06.191
There aren't that many guys in my life

01:06.274 --> 01:09.110
that I've felt this healthy
of a relationship with.

01:09.194 --> 01:13.156
And it's taught me about how to be treated

01:13.239 --> 01:16.451
and I don't have to ask
to be treated nicely.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.494
He just does.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.598
Isha, don't cry again. Ish, we love you.

01:39.599 --> 01:40.725
Oh, my God.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.061
Don't cry.

06:59.710 --> 07:00.545
Bless you.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.214
God damn it, you got that on me.

07:05.925 --> 07:06.968
What?

07:07.885 --> 07:08.719
What?

07:25.236 --> 07:27.155
I just feel like you're being annoying.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.948
How am I being annoying?

10:48.189 --> 10:49.523
I just walk in, she's with a guy.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.735
It's too little, too late.

10:52.818 --> 10:53.944
Like this?

10:54.904 --> 10:56.155
She's gonna lose it.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.345
<i>My first bite was really good.</i>

12:43.429 --> 12:44.805
What did you get, Keek?

12:44.889 --> 12:45.973
The same thing.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.975
-The beans are good.
-The beans are good.

12:48.058 --> 12:48.893
They're sweet.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.527
Michael!

12:58.611 --> 13:00.112
Hey, Roxy!

13:20.925 --> 13:22.593
That is so…

13:23.177 --> 13:24.011
Oh, my God.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.221
There is a picture of you two.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.972
I don't wanna touch it because I'm so…

13:27.056 --> 13:30.017
-I wanna take a picture.
-So cute!

13:31.894 --> 13:34.146
Oh, my…
I have to text this to my mom.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.083
Flowers!

13:54.166 --> 13:55.834
-No, this really--
-Wait, where is he?

13:55.918 --> 13:57.586
He's at the guys' house.

13:59.463 --> 14:00.506
This so cute.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.260
I think he really likes you.

19:01.765 --> 19:02.975
Guys, Zach is coming!

19:03.058 --> 19:04.560
Wait, is he?

19:08.480 --> 19:09.690
Oh, my God!

19:09.773 --> 19:11.817
He said, "Should be there shortly."

19:28.417 --> 19:29.668
My bestie!

19:52.608 --> 19:55.027
Kamari and Roxy, get together and dance.

20:13.837 --> 20:16.256
I am done.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.343
Oh, my God, he's pulling up!

21:02.427 --> 21:03.262
Good night, y'all!

21:03.345 --> 21:04.304
Love you, Keeks.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.264
Love you.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.445
Oh, my God. Zach…

25:10.175 --> 25:11.801
Who needs stupid guys?

25:12.928 --> 25:14.804
We have each other. Fuck all the guys.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.658
I just feel like, what's wrong with us?

25:34.741 --> 25:36.368
I don't think there's anything wrong.

25:36.451 --> 25:38.078
But why is it not working out?

25:38.828 --> 25:40.413
Like, how am I gonna find someone?

25:40.497 --> 25:41.915
Like, it's going to be hard.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.839
Muthafucka, what the hell!

26:30.922 --> 26:32.340
-Get some sleep.
-Love you, guys.

26:33.341 --> 26:36.011
-I'm so tired. Please leave me.
-Bye, Roxy. See you tomorrow.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.262
See you tomorrow.

26:38.722 --> 26:39.556
Wait.

26:40.515 --> 26:41.850
Did you hug me?

26:49.190 --> 26:50.233
Okay. Thanks.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.609
Now I'm happy you came.

26:58.575 --> 26:59.868
What was that laugh?

26:59.951 --> 27:00.994
That was real.

27:01.077 --> 27:01.911
Wait, what?

27:01.995 --> 27:03.038
You guys are real.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.164
No. No.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.081
You lie.

27:05.707 --> 27:06.916
He just picked me up.

27:07.917 --> 27:08.752
That's hot!

27:54.297 --> 27:56.633
I have a magic trick I want to show you.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.676
Use your imagination!
