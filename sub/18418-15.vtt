WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:01.920
- Previously on "Nashville"...

00:01.920 --> 00:04.000
- Girl, you can sing.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.500
- If you stick with me,
Hallie Jordan,

00:05.500 --> 00:06.880
you're gonna make a record.

00:06.880 --> 00:08.580
- You found this girl
on the street.

00:08.580 --> 00:10.040
- That's why I brought her here.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.540
- You can stay.
Until we figure something out.

00:11.540 --> 00:13.170
- I'm pregnant
and you're the father.

00:13.170 --> 00:15.880
Any chance of me being with him
is off the table.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.210
- You're the best person
I've ever known.

00:17.210 --> 00:18.830
Please, just say
you'll try with me.

00:20.620 --> 00:22.170
- We're being stopped
by this cop for no reason.

00:22.170 --> 00:24.290
- Ma'am, please stay in the car
- You want him to get out?

00:24.290 --> 00:26.120
Why didn't you ask me
to get out?

00:26.120 --> 00:27.750
- Ma'am get back in the car.
- Because he's black,

00:27.750 --> 00:29.120
is that why.
He did nothing wrong.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.790
- Hi, everyone.
I'm Megan Alexander

00:31.790 --> 00:33.500
with Inside Edition.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.120
And we're live outside
the home of Maddie Jaymes.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.920
Even as her actions have
inflamed a national debate,

00:38.920 --> 00:42.000
the response from Jaymes
has been a deafening silence.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.500
As we await an appearance
or possibly a statement,

00:44.500 --> 00:48.170
let's go back to the moment
that started it all.

00:48.170 --> 00:49.920
- "Why'd you ask him to get out
of the car and not me?

00:49.920 --> 00:51.330
Is it because he's black?
Is that why?

00:51.330 --> 00:52.920
Because he's not
driving a Range Rover?"

00:52.920 --> 00:56.000
- That's it. Turn it off.
- No!

00:56.000 --> 00:57.710
- I mean, when you look
at the video,

00:57.710 --> 01:00.330
Maddie Jaymes
is certainly very upset.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.880
Isn't it possible
she thought there was

01:01.880 --> 01:03.290
an actual threat, Greg?

01:03.290 --> 01:06.210
- This is a desperate
plea for attention

01:06.210 --> 01:07.750
from a teenager
who lost her mother.

01:07.750 --> 01:09.290
And that may be tragic,

01:09.290 --> 01:10.670
but let's not reward
bad behavior

01:10.670 --> 01:12.500
just because we feel
sorry for her.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.210
- Listen, this young man
was lucky that he had

01:15.210 --> 01:17.040
this teenager in a car with him.
- Wait...

01:17.040 --> 01:18.330
- Or he may not even
be alive today.

01:18.330 --> 01:20.170
- Oh, come on, Eric.

01:20.170 --> 01:22.210
- No. I've been pulled over
three times this year, Greg.

01:22.210 --> 01:23.500
How many times
you been pulled over?

01:27.330 --> 01:31.210
- Hey, just lay low today, okay?

01:31.210 --> 01:33.920
- I'll be fine.

01:36.170 --> 01:38.500
(reporters shouting questions)
- Back up. Back up!

01:38.500 --> 01:40.500
(honks car horn)
- Is Maddie with you?

01:40.500 --> 01:42.080
- Get back! Step back.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.750
(honks car horn)
- Come on!

01:49.120 --> 01:51.960
- Hey, I am so sorry, man.
How's Maddie?

01:51.960 --> 01:54.290
- It is horrible.
It's a whole circus, man.

01:54.290 --> 01:55.920
- Well, I'm already on it.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.790
We have a meeting with
Councilman Bryant tomorrow.

01:57.790 --> 02:00.420
But in the meantime, I'd like
you to meet someone, real quick.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.750
- Um, yeah, sure.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.120
- I don't know
how much you know

02:03.120 --> 02:04.580
about the goings on
in the tech world.

02:04.580 --> 02:06.540
But her name might ring a bell.
Alyssa Green,

02:06.540 --> 02:08.460
I'd like you to meet the one
and only Deacon Claybourne.

02:08.460 --> 02:09.920
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.080
- Oh, no. The pleasure
is mine, Mr. Claybourne.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.290
My friends who love country
music say that you are a legend.

02:14.290 --> 02:16.040
- Thank you.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.620
- I wanted to talk to you
about bringing Alyssa onboard

02:18.620 --> 02:20.540
as our Chief Strategy Officer.

02:20.540 --> 02:24.000
- Yeah, I told Zach there's no
way I am moving to Nashville.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.920
But then started
describing the challenges

02:25.920 --> 02:27.170
facing the music industry.

02:27.170 --> 02:29.040
And I'm a sucker for anyone

02:29.040 --> 02:30.580
who describes anything
as impossible.

02:30.580 --> 02:32.920
- (laughs) Alyssa helped
Jack Dorsey transform Twitter

02:32.920 --> 02:36.000
from a janky podcast service
into the monster it is today.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.670
She basically carved out
a special niche

02:38.670 --> 02:40.500
for herself as the go-to person

02:40.500 --> 02:42.290
when your company
desperately needs to pivot.

02:42.290 --> 02:45.330
You should check out
her TED Talk.

02:45.330 --> 02:47.620
- I will do that, yeah.

02:47.620 --> 02:48.670
Nice to meet you.

02:48.670 --> 02:50.420
- Oh, wait! Um...

02:50.420 --> 02:52.540
Maybe I could just walk you
through the elevator pitch.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.040
You know, if you could just give
me 20 minutes of your time?

02:55.040 --> 02:56.330
- Kind of a tall elevator.

02:56.330 --> 02:58.670
- Yeah, but it moves
really fast.

02:58.670 --> 03:00.380
- (laughs) Here.
(taps seat)

03:03.290 --> 03:04.830
- All right.

03:07.830 --> 03:10.420
- Just takes some
deep breaths, okay?

03:10.420 --> 03:13.540
Pretend like it's rehearsal.

03:13.540 --> 03:15.210
- Hey, girl, you ready?

03:15.210 --> 03:17.380
- No.

03:17.380 --> 03:20.120
- Honey, there are about 10
people in the audience tonight

03:20.120 --> 03:22.670
that have the power to change
your life, all right?

03:22.670 --> 03:26.040
So you're gonna go out there.
Act like you own,

03:26.040 --> 03:28.330
and let that huge voice
of yours do the rest,

03:28.330 --> 03:30.380
Okay?
- Okay.

03:30.380 --> 03:32.460
- All right.
Let's try that again.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.380
Are you ready?

03:36.620 --> 03:39.120
- (sighs) Yes.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.210
- Close enough.
Let's do it.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.790
Hey, you.
Thanks for coming.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.790
- My pleasure.

03:47.790 --> 03:49.420
From the looks of it,

03:49.420 --> 03:51.830
you convinced half the labels
in town to be here.

03:51.830 --> 03:54.500
- Nothing wrong with a little
healthy competition.

03:54.500 --> 03:58.460
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Hallie Jordan.

03:58.460 --> 03:59.670
- Woo!

04:05.420 --> 04:08.170
- Thank you all so much.

04:08.170 --> 04:09.750
It's a real honor to be
playing at the Bluebird.

05:05.210 --> 05:08.000

05:34.040 --> 05:36.670

Are you doing okay?

05:36.670 --> 05:37.710
- Maddie, everybody
in my neighborhood

05:37.710 --> 05:39.830
keeps staring at me, okay?

05:39.830 --> 05:41.830
People keep ringing my doorbell.
I hate this!

05:41.830 --> 05:43.960
- (sighs) Well, I've been
home all day.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.040
Do you want to come over?
- Are you serious?

05:46.040 --> 05:48.040
I'm not even going outside.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.460
- Well, maybe I can come to you.

05:49.460 --> 05:52.540
- I'm busy.

05:52.540 --> 05:54.040
- Clay, are you sure
you're okay?

05:54.040 --> 05:56.290
- Look, I gotta go, okay?

06:18.420 --> 06:20.210
- Councilman shouldn't be
more than a few minutes.

06:20.210 --> 06:21.580
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

06:23.620 --> 06:25.830
- Hey, so what'd
you think about Alyssa?

06:25.830 --> 06:27.540
- Uh, yeah.

06:27.540 --> 06:29.080
What's all this about
needing to pivot, huh?

06:29.080 --> 06:31.210
You got your album.
It's selling like crazy.

06:31.210 --> 06:32.830
- And then what?
The truth is,

06:32.830 --> 06:34.920
the label survived
on Rayna's fame.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.710
What she brought in
subsidized everybody else.

06:37.710 --> 06:39.210
Alyssa's whole mission
is to put us on a path

06:39.210 --> 06:41.460
that would be sustainable
for years to come.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.040
- Yeah, with music, though,
right? Not widgets.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.460
- 100%.

06:44.460 --> 06:45.960
Look, if it makes you
more comfortable,

06:45.960 --> 06:48.210
I can ask if she's okay
with a trial period.

06:48.210 --> 06:49.880
Like three months?
And if you don't like

06:49.880 --> 06:51.540
what she does by the end
of that, then we fire her.

06:51.540 --> 06:53.380
- I'll think about it.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.920
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

06:54.920 --> 06:57.540
- Thank you for taking the time.
- Of course, Zach.

06:57.540 --> 06:59.880
Deacon, I know it's been
a tough year for your family.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.290
I'm sorry.
- I appreciate that.

07:01.290 --> 07:02.880
- How's Maddie doing?

07:02.880 --> 07:04.830
- Well, she's afraid
to go out in public.

07:04.830 --> 07:06.460
She's afraid to look
at her phone.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.210
She's a tough girl.
But this is a little much.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.210
- She doesn't deserve it.

07:10.210 --> 07:12.830
Now let's get her
and everyone else some relief.

07:12.830 --> 07:15.040
- Sounds like a plan to me.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.920
How can we help?

07:17.920 --> 07:21.210
- Well, look, we're still
investigating the incident.

07:21.210 --> 07:23.460
But in the meantime, we need
to send a message of unity.

07:23.460 --> 07:24.790
- What does that mean?

07:24.790 --> 07:26.710
- We need to make
a group statement.

07:26.710 --> 07:28.380
We'll get the chief of police,

07:28.380 --> 07:30.040
representative from the NAACP,

07:30.040 --> 07:32.620
me, Maddie.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.580
She'll apologize and
everyone can just move on.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.120
- She should apologize?

07:36.120 --> 07:38.210
- That's the only way
this is gonna work.

07:40.290 --> 07:42.290
- I'll talk to her.

07:42.290 --> 07:45.080
- My goodness,
all this stuff that's happening

07:45.080 --> 07:47.710
with Maddie is just awful.
Poor thing.

07:47.710 --> 07:49.080
How much can happen
to one person?

07:51.460 --> 07:53.580
- Hi, Scarlett.
- Hi. Sorry.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.620
You're...cooking.

07:55.620 --> 07:57.120
You've cleaned.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.420
There's candles and music.
What happened?

07:59.420 --> 08:03.040
- Uh, night off from performing?
Alone with you?

08:03.040 --> 08:04.420
- That's really sweet.

08:04.420 --> 08:06.750
- Wow.
- Yeah. Smells good, right?

08:10.250 --> 08:12.830
- Don't burn your sauce.

08:12.830 --> 08:15.120
- It's fine.
It's just simmering.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.250
What's wrong?
- Nothing. Just...

08:18.250 --> 08:19.830
You know what?
I think it's this business

08:19.830 --> 08:21.880
of having another thing
inside me.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.330
It's making everything feel off.

08:24.330 --> 08:26.080
Even my taste buds.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.670
- That's why I can't resist you.
- (chuckles)

08:28.670 --> 08:30.750
- You got that glow.
- Oh, thank you.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.330
- Well, I hope your appetite

08:32.330 --> 08:33.670
for home-cooked pasta
hasn't changed.

08:33.670 --> 08:35.670
- It is quite intact,
I assure you.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.880
- Mr. Claybourne,
I don't know what to say.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.920
- Well, I'm sure you're gonna
be getting other offers.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.290
But I just want to promise you

08:46.290 --> 08:48.000
that nobody in this town
wants to sign you

08:48.000 --> 08:49.330
as badly as I do.

08:49.330 --> 08:50.880
- Put her on speaker!
Come on!

08:50.880 --> 08:52.920
- Just wait.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.620
- You wanna sleep on it, though?
Because, I mean, you can.

08:55.620 --> 08:57.290
- Is that okay?
- Is what okay?

08:57.290 --> 08:58.540
- Of course, it is.

08:58.540 --> 09:00.710
- Thank you, Mr. Claybourne.

09:00.710 --> 09:01.880
- You're welcome, Hallie.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.250
And call me Deacon.

09:04.250 --> 09:07.040
- Okay, sorry.
Will do.

09:08.830 --> 09:11.710
- He wants to sign us!

09:11.710 --> 09:13.040
That's amazing!

09:13.040 --> 09:15.540
What happens next?
- I have no idea.

09:15.540 --> 09:17.210
He invited me to dinner tomorrow

09:17.210 --> 09:20.290
to meet the rest of the artists.

09:20.290 --> 09:22.540
I can see if there's room
for all of us.

09:22.540 --> 09:24.830
- I get it.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.420
It might bring up
some questions anyway.

09:26.420 --> 09:29.080
- You know,
once you've moved out,

09:29.080 --> 09:30.080
then it'll be little eas--

09:30.080 --> 09:31.620
- You know how much
I want to do that.

09:31.620 --> 09:33.420
- I know.

09:33.420 --> 09:34.880
- Tina was crying today,

09:34.880 --> 09:37.500
because she had
a bad report card.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.920
Eric cut his foot
at the playground.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.420
It's like there's
never a good time.

09:44.420 --> 09:46.580
- I get it.

09:46.580 --> 09:49.380
- Speaking of which,
I said I was gonna be back.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.040
- You gonna leave now?

09:51.040 --> 09:53.500
- I gotta go.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.750
Brandi'll throw a fit.

10:04.710 --> 10:07.000
- All right, that's it.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.920
- I look like Iggy Azalea!

10:08.920 --> 10:10.750
- I used to steal
my foster mom's makeup

10:10.750 --> 10:12.580
like, all the time
when I was like, nine.

10:12.580 --> 10:14.790
I can't believe
you barely wear any.

10:14.790 --> 10:17.210
- I mean...I wear makeup.

10:17.210 --> 10:18.880
I just like wear more
when I perform.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.540
- Just hold still while
I do your lips, okay?

10:22.540 --> 10:24.960
- Hey, Daph?
- Yeah?

10:24.960 --> 10:28.580
- I thought Mom didn't want us
to wear makeup till high school.

10:28.580 --> 10:31.040
- Maddie, we're in my room
just messing around.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.580
- I'm just saying she probably
wouldn't have liked it.

10:32.580 --> 10:34.620
- Yo! Why are you
trying to make her feel bad?

10:34.620 --> 10:36.920
- I'm not. I'm just
trying to talk to my sister.

10:36.920 --> 10:39.420
- Yea, aren't you late for
an apology tour or something?

10:39.420 --> 10:40.540
(doorbell rings)

10:40.540 --> 10:42.290
- Yeah, something like that.

10:42.290 --> 10:44.620
- Want some mascara?

10:44.620 --> 10:46.380
- I think I'll live without it.

10:52.790 --> 10:55.380
- Hey, so good to see you.

10:55.380 --> 10:57.580
- You too.
How's your dad doing?

10:57.580 --> 10:59.080
- Oh, he's doing okay.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.920
He's just working late as usual.
- Yeah.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.420
- You can hang for a bit
if you want.

11:02.420 --> 11:05.710
- Thanks. Actually,
I wanted to talk to you.

11:05.710 --> 11:07.080
I saw what happened.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.170
And I felt like
I couldn't stay away.

11:09.170 --> 11:11.290
- Thank you.
Some station in Memphis

11:11.290 --> 11:13.380
just dropped me
from their rotation.

11:13.380 --> 11:15.380
If you can believe that.

11:15.380 --> 11:17.540
- You're a little young
to remember this.

11:17.540 --> 11:19.960
But when Natalie Maines
got onstage

11:19.960 --> 11:22.920
and criticized President Bush?

11:22.920 --> 11:25.120
The Dixie Chicks
got dropped from every single

11:25.120 --> 11:26.750
country radio station
the next day.

11:26.750 --> 11:29.210
- Yeah, but that was
a long time ago, right?

11:29.210 --> 11:31.080
- In some ways, yeah.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.750
Kacey Musgraves
has done all right.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.290
And her stuff gets
a little bit risky.

11:34.290 --> 11:36.170
But there's still
some areas, you know.

11:36.170 --> 11:40.830
God, country, military, police,
that are no-fly zones.

11:40.830 --> 11:43.290
And, you know, you went there.

11:45.170 --> 11:46.790
- So what are you saying?

11:46.790 --> 11:49.580
- I can't tell you what
the right thing to do is.

11:49.580 --> 11:51.620
All I can tell you is

11:51.620 --> 11:53.750
that the music world can be
pretty unforgiving.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.540
Especially with young artists.

11:56.540 --> 12:00.000
Natalie never apologized.
And that was brave.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.460
But her career
was never the same.

12:06.420 --> 12:08.540
- Hey, I need a minute.
- Of course.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.750
- Oh!

12:13.380 --> 12:16.330
It's all gonna be okay, baby.
I promise.

12:16.330 --> 12:18.380
You're like me.
You're a survivor.

12:18.380 --> 12:21.170
What's your publicist
saying to you?

12:21.170 --> 12:22.460
- My dad said
the Councilman's office

12:22.460 --> 12:24.080
wants me to apologize
to everyone.

12:24.080 --> 12:27.250
Some big organized
press conference.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.750
- I don't understand
why people are so afraid

12:29.750 --> 12:31.460
of a little controversy.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.420
- Can I ask you something?

12:33.420 --> 12:35.210
- Of course.

12:35.210 --> 12:36.330
- You have to be
completely honest.

12:36.330 --> 12:37.500
You saw the video, right?

12:37.500 --> 12:40.920
- Only about 50 times.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.420
- Do you think
I did anything wrong?

12:44.420 --> 12:49.040
- I thought you were amazing.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.830
- (chuckles)

12:50.830 --> 12:51.830
- We're ready when you are,
Juliette.

12:51.830 --> 12:53.210
- All right. Hang on.

12:53.210 --> 12:55.710
All right, just--
Let me walk you out.

12:55.710 --> 12:58.120
- No! I want to hear
what you've been working on.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.290
- No, honey.
It's a mess.

13:00.290 --> 13:03.620
Right now, I wanna--
- I want to see your process.

13:03.620 --> 13:06.790
- Oh, you're killing me.

13:06.790 --> 13:08.710

for coming in.

14:38.380 --> 14:40.420
I know you are super busy.

14:40.420 --> 14:42.040
But I thought this would be
sort of a special occasion.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.620
I'd like to introduce you all

14:43.620 --> 14:46.000
to the new interim
Chief Strategy Officer

14:46.000 --> 14:48.670
for Highway 65,
Alyssa Greene.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.420
- Thank you.
Hey, everyone.

14:53.420 --> 14:55.290
I am a big believer
in radical honesty.

14:55.290 --> 14:57.500
So I'm just gonna
tell you right now

14:57.500 --> 14:59.080
that I have never worked
in the music business.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.790
And I know zero
about country music.

15:01.790 --> 15:04.120
But sometimes it takes
an outside perspective

15:04.120 --> 15:05.920
to see things clearly.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.620
Album sales, they're never going
back to their glory days.

15:08.620 --> 15:10.540
And with this roster streaming,
it's worth crap.

15:10.540 --> 15:13.040
And touring deals from
the standpoint of this label?

15:13.040 --> 15:15.670
Well, they are the purview
of the artist.

15:15.670 --> 15:18.500
And that leaves us
with one market yet to be mined.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.330
Brand partnerships.

15:20.330 --> 15:22.670
- Hi. I'm Scarlett.
- Hi.

15:22.670 --> 15:25.250
- So you'd like us to write
a song for products?

15:25.250 --> 15:30.460
- Yes, and your first assignment
is Charmin toilet paper.

15:30.460 --> 15:31.670
I'm kidding.

15:31.670 --> 15:33.170
For those of you
who don't know me,

15:33.170 --> 15:35.710
which is all of you,
I am not always serious.

15:35.710 --> 15:38.460
The point is, today's consumer,
they're sophisticated.

15:38.460 --> 15:40.670
They don't want to feel like
they're watching an ad.

15:40.670 --> 15:43.920
So coming from that perspective,
the best kind of integration,

15:43.920 --> 15:46.750
it blends the interests of
an influencer and a brand

15:46.750 --> 15:49.040
in a way that is
entirely frictionless.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.750
- Hi. I'm Gunnar.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.460
I'm still confused
by what that means.

15:53.460 --> 15:55.540
- Okay, do you remember
the skydiver, Felix Baumgartner,

15:55.540 --> 15:58.080
breaking the sound barrier?

15:58.080 --> 16:00.120
Well, he was sponsored
by Red Bull.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.830
If we do this right,
you can find the resources

16:02.830 --> 16:05.080
you need to allow yourselves
to grow as artists.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.540
And still do it
on your own terms.

16:07.540 --> 16:12.080
- And make the companies
paying for this happy?

16:12.080 --> 16:14.580
- I'm telling you
it is possible.

16:14.580 --> 16:16.710
- Okay, guys,
I'm sensing some hesitancy.

16:16.710 --> 16:18.920
And I completely
understand that.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.620
Thank you, Alyssa.
- Yeah.

16:20.620 --> 16:24.210
- All we are asking is that you
give this a chance, okay?

16:24.210 --> 16:25.790
See what kind of doors
it would unlock.

16:29.290 --> 16:31.080
- Why you looking at me?
Dylan does it.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.960
Y'all better than him?

16:32.960 --> 16:34.500
Gotta make some sacrifices
around here, all right?

16:34.500 --> 16:35.790
Not a big damn deal.

16:35.790 --> 16:38.290
Go on.
- Okay.

16:38.290 --> 16:40.540
(talking and laughing)

16:45.960 --> 16:49.880
(taps glass)

16:49.880 --> 16:51.960
- The other night, I saw someone
play at the Bluebird,

16:51.960 --> 16:56.500
and it gave me chills.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.500
Now that has happened a couple
of times in this town.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.330
But those moments
are few and far between.

17:01.330 --> 17:04.380
So I want to thank
my friend, Juliette,

17:04.380 --> 17:06.000
for introducing me to someone

17:06.000 --> 17:07.330
who we very much hope
will become a member

17:07.330 --> 17:09.500
of this Highway 65 family.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.920
And it is a family.

17:11.920 --> 17:14.880
Hallie, artists like you

17:14.880 --> 17:16.790
are the reason why
Rayna started this label.

17:20.620 --> 17:23.540
Cheers.
- Cheers!

17:28.210 --> 17:30.580
- You know, roots music has
always been a passion of mine.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.290
But it's only been
the last couple of years

17:32.290 --> 17:34.380
that I discovered groups like
the New Lost City Ramblers,

17:34.380 --> 17:36.500
Joe Thompson,
Mississippi Sheiks...

17:36.500 --> 17:38.580
- Wait a minute.
You know about Joe Thompson?

17:38.580 --> 17:40.540
- Yeah.
Yeah, he's amazing.

17:40.540 --> 17:42.420
And, you know, not enough
people know about his stuff.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.170
And it's just--
it's another reason why

17:44.170 --> 17:46.960
what you're doing
is really special.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.790
- Well, thank you.

17:48.790 --> 17:50.830
- Listen, Hallie,
I would be thrilled

17:50.830 --> 17:54.120
if you'd consider having
me produce your album.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.460
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

17:55.460 --> 17:56.880
- That's amazing.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.540
- And there are some
incredible musicians

17:58.540 --> 18:00.210
that we could bring in for it.

18:00.210 --> 18:01.790
I mean, when I saw you
at the Bluebird, it...

18:01.790 --> 18:04.500
- Wait, wait, wait.
I mean, that's great.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.250
But I'm confused.
I mean, I've got my guys.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.210
- Yeah, no, I know,
and they're good.

18:09.210 --> 18:13.710
But, Hallie,
you need great, you know.

18:13.710 --> 18:15.380
People that don't
just do it right

18:15.380 --> 18:18.920
but do it in a way that
just takes it to another level.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.500
- You want me to fire my band?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.960
- No, no.
That's not what I'm saying.

18:22.960 --> 18:24.880
I'm just saying that,
for this album,

18:24.880 --> 18:27.170
I think we have better options.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.880
- Check this out, and then
we can go back downstairs, okay?

18:37.290 --> 18:39.880
Here. Look.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.420
- (laughs) Wait.
Where did you find that?

18:41.420 --> 18:44.790
- I made it myself,
but it's not online yet.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.040
Should I publish it?
- What?

18:47.040 --> 18:48.620
No, you can't post that.

18:48.620 --> 18:50.620
- It's just a joke.
You just laughed at it.

18:50.620 --> 18:52.330
- Yeah, but this isn't--
- Don't you think that

18:52.330 --> 18:54.830
she takes everything just
like a little bit too seriously?

18:54.830 --> 18:56.460
Besides, it's not
like anyone's gonna

18:56.460 --> 18:58.540
even really see it anyways.

18:58.540 --> 19:00.420
- Okay, fine.

19:03.210 --> 19:07.710
- Cool.
It's up, let's go.

19:14.790 --> 19:18.250
- Hey, are you okay?

19:23.710 --> 19:25.790
What's going on?

19:27.920 --> 19:31.250
- I brought up
moving out with Brandi.

19:31.250 --> 19:33.620
She just freaked out.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.040
Started throwing stuff.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.080
She said she's gonna
take the kids.

19:36.080 --> 19:39.000
- She can't do that.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.250
- I just don't know what to do.

19:41.250 --> 19:42.380
- You've got to get a lawyer.

19:42.380 --> 19:43.960
- With what money, Hallie?

19:48.830 --> 19:50.880
I'm sorry.
I can go.

19:50.880 --> 19:54.540
- No. Come on.
Let's go inside.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.210
- Maddie, get in the car.
- No! This is insane!

20:02.210 --> 20:04.960
- Maddie!
- What are you doing?

20:04.960 --> 20:07.380
Are you kidding me?
- No, ma'am, I'm not.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.080
You're being detained for
refusal to follow my command.

20:11.670 --> 20:14.330
- Some new developments
today in the police incident

20:14.330 --> 20:16.170
involving Maddie Jaymes,

20:16.170 --> 20:18.670
the daughter of deceased
country legend, Rayna Jaymes.

20:18.670 --> 20:20.290
There's been a lot
of speculation,

20:20.290 --> 20:22.540
but few hard facts,
about the driver of the vehicle,

20:22.540 --> 20:24.380
Clayton Carter.

20:24.380 --> 20:26.290
But police reports have
surfaced today that indicate

20:26.290 --> 20:29.080
this is not Carter's first brush
with law enforcement.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.210
Five years ago, the Louisville
City Police Department

20:31.210 --> 20:34.040
responded to reports
of a domestic dispute

20:34.040 --> 20:37.120
between Carter and the boyfriend
of his late mother.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.330
Officers arrived on the scene
to find Carter

20:39.330 --> 20:41.460
barricaded inside
the family's bathroom

20:41.460 --> 20:43.170
threatening to kill himself.

20:43.170 --> 20:45.460
And now we've obtained
911 audio from...

20:53.250 --> 20:55.210
- Hey, you missed me.
Leave a message.

21:04.420 --> 21:06.920
- So the key here is to rip
the Band-Aid off quickly.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.830
So it doesn't overshadow
the release of your EP.

21:08.830 --> 21:11.500
- I'm not saying this.
- Any of it?

21:11.500 --> 21:13.080
- "I was in a highly
anxious state at the time.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.830
"And lost control
of my emotions,

21:14.830 --> 21:17.000
"and acted with a profound
disrespect to law enforcement.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.880
"I'm a teenager and
I had a teenage response

21:18.880 --> 21:20.460
to what happened."
No way.

21:20.460 --> 21:23.330
- Look, maybe we could
change some of the words.

21:23.330 --> 21:24.880
Make them more yours,
what you want to say...

21:24.880 --> 21:26.920
- No. It's not about
the specific words.

21:26.920 --> 21:28.880
If I did something wrong,
then so did the cops.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.250
And that did not say that.

21:30.250 --> 21:31.670
- All right, well,
this is not his apology.

21:31.670 --> 21:32.960
This is your apology.
- Maddie, Maddie?

21:32.960 --> 21:35.330
I came up in PR
in crisis management.

21:35.330 --> 21:37.500
And what I learned is that
it's a lot like marriage.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.080
Sometimes you just
have to say you're sorry.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.830
And pretend that you mean it.

21:40.830 --> 21:43.170
- Then count me out.
I'm not doing this.

21:43.170 --> 21:46.120
- Baby, look,

21:46.120 --> 21:47.380
all this stuff
that is happening,

21:47.380 --> 21:48.750
it is not going away.

21:48.750 --> 21:50.120
And I see how
that's hurting you.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.670
And it's killing me to see it.

21:51.670 --> 21:53.210
So why don't you say
some of this stuff.

21:53.210 --> 21:54.830
And make it go away?
Isn't that what we want?

21:54.830 --> 21:56.750
Move on?
- Not if it means having to lie.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.830
- I'm not asking you to lie.

21:58.830 --> 22:00.250
And I admire the way
you're standing up

22:00.250 --> 22:01.790
for what you believe.

22:01.790 --> 22:03.500
But you're honestly
gonna tell me

22:03.500 --> 22:04.830
there's nothing you would
change about that night?

22:04.830 --> 22:07.040
- I'm late for work.
Sorry, guys.

22:12.250 --> 22:15.080
- Oh my God.
Oh, my God, Liv?

22:15.080 --> 22:18.380
The page you created,
it's blowing up!

22:18.380 --> 22:20.330
Oh, my God, really mean stuff.

22:20.330 --> 22:22.080
- Wow, It is!

22:26.170 --> 22:29.290
(laughs)
I mean, that was pretty funny.

22:29.290 --> 22:30.750
- Liv! Delete it!

22:30.750 --> 22:32.250
- It's a little late for that.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.960
- Just do it!
- Fine!

22:34.960 --> 22:37.170
But I can't stop other people
from doing their own versions.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.330
- So this plan for the label?
What Alyssa was talking about?

22:48.330 --> 22:49.750
What'd you think?

22:49.750 --> 22:52.750
- I guess it's
worth considering.

22:52.750 --> 22:55.210
- That's great.
And what did the others think?

22:55.210 --> 22:57.170
- I get the feeling
it's gonna be a tough sell.

22:57.170 --> 22:59.960
- I don't know, do you think
you could maybe help with that?

22:59.960 --> 23:01.380
Explain it from
your perspective,

23:01.380 --> 23:03.080
from the artist's perspective.

23:03.080 --> 23:05.750
- I don't know, man.

23:05.750 --> 23:08.290
Look, it was awkward enough

23:08.290 --> 23:11.500
when I agreed to talk to Deacon
about releasing that album.

23:13.380 --> 23:15.250
These are my best friends.

23:15.250 --> 23:17.330
They know we're together.

23:17.330 --> 23:18.830
It just doesn't feel right.

23:18.830 --> 23:20.670
- Well, even if you
apart from me

23:20.670 --> 23:21.880
think it's not
such a horrible idea?

23:21.880 --> 23:23.210
- That part's irrelevant.

23:23.210 --> 23:24.830
Look, I just don't
wanna feel like

23:24.830 --> 23:26.460
I'm some sort of middle man...

23:26.460 --> 23:29.920
- No, I get it, I get it.
I do, and I'm sorry.

23:29.920 --> 23:31.460
But, you know, for the record,

23:31.460 --> 23:34.000
I am just trying to help
all you guys succeed.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.460
- I know.

23:36.460 --> 23:37.960
Maybe just...

23:37.960 --> 23:40.460
keep me out of this stuff
moving forward.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.040
- Of course.

23:44.380 --> 23:47.040
- Surprise.
- Oh hey.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.380
Please tell me you're here
to teach me Excel.

23:49.380 --> 23:52.120
- Hell, no.
How's Maddie?

23:52.120 --> 23:56.080
- Ah, well, she's a teenager.

23:56.080 --> 23:57.420
Full of idealism.

23:57.420 --> 23:59.500
- Better than cynicism, I guess.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.620
- Some days.
- (chuckles)

24:01.620 --> 24:03.540
- How about you?

24:03.540 --> 24:06.120
Last time I spoke with you,
you was in a bit of a pickle.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.540
- Kinda resolved itself.

24:09.540 --> 24:11.670
I mean, Damien's back
in London or Romania

24:11.670 --> 24:14.580
or wherever he better belongs.

24:14.580 --> 24:16.290
- And Gunnar?

24:16.290 --> 24:20.210
- Oh, Gunnar and I
are...something.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.380
- You're something?

24:22.380 --> 24:23.750
- We spend all our time together

24:23.750 --> 24:25.710
like we're a couple, except...

24:25.710 --> 24:30.330
is it weird that I never
really want to be physical?

24:30.330 --> 24:31.710
- Sorry. I know it's
too much information,

24:31.710 --> 24:33.750
but it's weird.

24:33.750 --> 24:36.670
For the first time, he's steady

24:36.670 --> 24:38.750
and he knows what he wants.

24:38.750 --> 24:43.170
And he's standing by me
and my baby, and...

24:45.960 --> 24:47.750
- Sweetie, I can't
tell you what to do.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.580
But I can say this.

24:49.580 --> 24:52.330
Life will deal you
some strange hands.

24:52.330 --> 24:54.580
- Amen.

24:54.580 --> 24:59.330
- You may not feel a certain way
for him right now.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.380
Doesn't mean it
can't change back.

25:01.380 --> 25:04.580
Maybe just take a little
pressure off

25:04.580 --> 25:06.710
how you're supposed to feel.

25:06.710 --> 25:09.040
And appreciate the fact
that he said

25:09.040 --> 25:10.540
he's gonna stand by your side
on this journey.

25:12.210 --> 25:14.330
- Thank you.
- Was that good?

25:14.330 --> 25:16.290
- Yeah, that was really good.

25:16.290 --> 25:18.120
Feels like a 15-pound weight's
just been lifted off my chest.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.460
I love you so much.

25:20.460 --> 25:22.500
- Oh, you do look taller.
- Oh, thank you.

25:25.460 --> 25:28.000
(cell phone rings)

25:42.500 --> 25:45.920
(heavy rock music playing)

25:48.460 --> 25:50.500
(cell phone rings)

25:59.040 --> 26:01.620
- Hey, you missed me.
Leave a message.

26:07.170 --> 26:08.750
- Hi.
Can I help you?

26:08.750 --> 26:10.540
- Uh, yeah.
You're Maddie Jaymes, right?

26:10.540 --> 26:12.420
- Who are you?
- My name is Justin.

26:12.420 --> 26:14.750
I'm a reporter for The Nation.
I just had a few questions.

26:14.750 --> 26:17.210
- No, I'm not talking to you.
- Maddie, listen.

26:17.210 --> 26:20.000
A lot of people have been saying
a lot of stupid things.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.670
But I'm here to tell you that
I think you were really brave.

26:22.670 --> 26:24.040
- Yeah, okay.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.920
- You know how many videos
of black people

26:25.920 --> 26:27.670
getting harassed by police
get made every day?

26:27.670 --> 26:30.880
And 95% of them
don't even become news.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.790
It took you standing up as
an ally to people of color

26:34.790 --> 26:36.120
to make this a big story.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.040
You've got a platform.

26:38.040 --> 26:39.960
Don't you have
anything you want to say?

26:43.120 --> 26:44.710
- I can't do this.

26:44.710 --> 26:46.170
- Why not?

26:46.170 --> 26:48.670
- I can't record
without my band.

26:48.670 --> 26:50.420
George will be devastated.

26:50.420 --> 26:52.250
- Oh, you mean the guitar player

26:52.250 --> 26:53.670
who says he's in love with you?

26:53.670 --> 26:55.880
But he still lives
with his wife? That one?

26:55.880 --> 26:58.080
- They're not a couple anymore.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.620
They live in separate bedrooms.

26:59.620 --> 27:01.290
And it's only...

27:01.290 --> 27:02.460
- Are you listening to the words

27:02.460 --> 27:05.330
that are coming
out of your mouth?

27:05.330 --> 27:08.120
If I were your sister
or your daughter

27:08.120 --> 27:10.210
and I were saying this to you,

27:10.210 --> 27:12.120
that I was gonna walk away

27:12.120 --> 27:15.120
from the biggest
opportunity in my life

27:15.120 --> 27:16.620
because I was in love
with some schmuck,

27:16.620 --> 27:19.120
what would you say to me?

27:19.120 --> 27:20.920
- I'm not in love with him.

27:20.920 --> 27:23.290
It's about something
more than that.

27:23.290 --> 27:26.420
- What's it about?

27:26.420 --> 27:28.750
- George and I...

27:28.750 --> 27:32.080
we created the sound
for my music.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.380
- Did he write any of the songs?

27:34.380 --> 27:36.170
- No.

27:36.170 --> 27:39.380
- Do you think he's a musician
of exceptional talent?

27:39.380 --> 27:42.170
- He needs me, okay?

27:42.170 --> 27:43.670
- I get that.

27:43.670 --> 27:46.920
What I don't understand
is why you need him.

27:46.920 --> 27:50.670
- When he's onstage with me,
I feel safe.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.500
- Honey, listen to me.

27:54.500 --> 27:57.080
Safety is the enemy.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.710
If you are not willing
to take risks,

27:58.710 --> 28:01.250
you might as well just
go on back to your day job.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.080
- Maybe I should.

28:10.960 --> 28:15.750
- Nine ball, corner pocket.

28:15.750 --> 28:17.580
So is it true you're gonna be
producing Hallie's album?

28:17.580 --> 28:19.620
- It's not set in stone,
but I think so.

28:19.620 --> 28:21.620
- That is amazing.

28:21.620 --> 28:24.790
That girl's got some pipes.
- Mm-hmm.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.670
Maybe if you're lucky,
Deacon'll let you cut a track

28:26.670 --> 28:29.460
of her singing about
vacuum cleaners or tires.

28:29.460 --> 28:31.880
- You think Deacon wants
to be in that position?

28:31.880 --> 28:33.330
Nobody's got more
integrity than my uncle.

28:33.330 --> 28:35.920
Besides, he's got
a business to run.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.580
Two girls to take care of.

28:37.580 --> 28:38.750
And he's gotta
pay all of y'all.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.960
- Would you cut it out?
- Told you.

28:41.960 --> 28:43.620
Look, I get it.

28:43.620 --> 28:45.420
You gotta do whatever
it takes to make ends meet.

28:45.420 --> 28:47.170
Hell, I used to make jingles,

28:47.170 --> 28:49.380
- Whatever, it's just
selling out to Silicon Valley

28:49.380 --> 28:51.750
and the bottom line.
- Cheers.

28:51.750 --> 28:53.170
- I need you, buddy.
She's killing us.

28:56.670 --> 28:59.380
- Finally!
- Okay, let me just say again

28:59.380 --> 29:03.080
Zach's not a bad guy.
He's just trying to do his job.

29:03.080 --> 29:06.120
- Yeah, but do you
like the idea?

29:06.120 --> 29:10.170
- Uh...still thinking about it.

29:10.170 --> 29:12.290
- What if we say no?
- I don't know.

29:12.290 --> 29:13.710
Why is everybody always acting

29:13.710 --> 29:15.080
like something bad's
gonna happen?

29:15.080 --> 29:16.580
- I don't know,
maybe because

29:16.580 --> 29:17.790
we've heard about
devious billionaires.

29:17.790 --> 29:20.580
(text message rings)

29:20.580 --> 29:24.080
- Oh, shoot. I gotta run.
- What's up?

29:24.080 --> 29:26.290
- Oh, nothing, it's just the
usual routine with Juliette.

29:26.290 --> 29:28.040
- What's that?

29:28.040 --> 29:30.750
- She starts the fires
and I put 'em out.

29:34.380 --> 29:36.750
- I don't like being
in this position.

29:36.750 --> 29:37.920
I'm a musician myself.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.460
I don't want to put
anyone out of a job.

29:39.460 --> 29:42.290
But the music...

29:42.290 --> 29:45.580
the music has to come first.

29:45.580 --> 29:47.620
It's bigger than all of us.

29:47.620 --> 29:51.250
You just need to trust me.

29:51.250 --> 29:52.830
- Well, what are you suggesting?

29:52.830 --> 29:55.790
- Two hours in the studio
tomorrow morning.

29:55.790 --> 29:57.880
With the players
I want on your record.

29:59.830 --> 30:03.500
- You have no idea
how big a deal this is for me.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.620
- I think I do.

30:08.960 --> 30:11.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:17.750 --> 30:20.670
- What is it?
- Uh, nothing.

30:20.670 --> 30:23.830
Just people being mean.

30:23.830 --> 30:27.460
I just reacted, you know.
I didn't even think.

30:27.460 --> 30:31.540
And now everyone's making me
into all types of things.

30:31.540 --> 30:33.670
And even you think
it was my fault.

30:33.670 --> 30:36.380
- I never said that.

30:36.380 --> 30:38.710
I didn't, baby.
Maddie?

30:41.790 --> 30:43.960
- What happened?

30:43.960 --> 30:46.250
- Just a bunch of people online,

30:46.250 --> 30:49.500
saying really mean, horrible
things about your sister.

30:49.500 --> 30:52.960
I'll never understand it.
A 17-year-old girl?

30:52.960 --> 30:55.500
What kind of person does that?

30:59.290 --> 31:02.170
- Why don't we just
try one from the top?

31:02.170 --> 31:04.710
(music plays)

31:19.540 --> 31:21.540
There she is.
Hi.

31:21.540 --> 31:22.880
- Sorry I'm late.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.880
- Welcome. Come on.

31:24.880 --> 31:28.750
So, uh, that's Kevin Burns
on the guitar.

31:28.750 --> 31:31.500
Dwayne Simpson on the drums.

31:31.500 --> 31:32.960
Allen Frazier on organ.

31:32.960 --> 31:34.960
Dawn McCarthy on bass.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.620
I just gave them the song
like 20 minutes ago,

31:36.620 --> 31:37.710
if you can believe it.

31:37.710 --> 31:40.040
- That's amazing.

31:40.040 --> 31:43.120
Can I go sing with them?

31:43.120 --> 31:44.330
- It's your song, Hallie.
Go for it.

31:59.960 --> 32:03.920

32:03.920 --> 32:06.580

33:04.670 --> 33:07.000
(knocking on door)
- Hey, it's me.

33:10.790 --> 33:12.670
(knocking on door)
Clay?

33:16.880 --> 33:18.420
- Hey.
- Hi.

33:25.460 --> 33:27.000
What's wrong?

33:27.000 --> 33:28.920
- I can't sleep.

33:28.920 --> 33:30.580
- When did you last?

33:30.580 --> 33:33.500
- Three days ago.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.210
- Okay, can I get you something?

33:35.210 --> 33:36.540
Will you let me
take you somewhere?

33:36.540 --> 33:37.830
- Look, Maddie,

33:37.830 --> 33:39.620
you can't help me.
- Why?

33:39.620 --> 33:42.460
- Because we can't keep
going like this.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.080
- So you're breaking up
with me over this?

33:49.080 --> 33:52.710
- Maddie, look...

33:52.710 --> 33:55.880
there's nothing
really to break up.

33:55.880 --> 33:59.210
Okay, we were never really
boyfriend and girlfriend.

33:59.210 --> 34:03.580
There was never
a real place for us.

34:03.580 --> 34:05.330
We just couldn't admit it.

34:05.330 --> 34:06.620
- How do you know that?

34:06.620 --> 34:10.880
- Will you just look at me?

34:10.880 --> 34:15.290
I care about you so much.

34:15.290 --> 34:17.080
And maybe it was
because on some level,

34:17.080 --> 34:18.540
I knew this wouldn't work.

34:18.540 --> 34:20.960
But I let myself feel

34:20.960 --> 34:23.580
And I feel so much for you.

34:23.580 --> 34:25.500
- Me too.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.830
- I'm sorry.

34:31.080 --> 34:32.670
- It's okay.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.330
- Oh, Maddie, baby.

34:55.170 --> 34:56.460
It's okay.

34:56.460 --> 34:58.250
- I'm sorry for
being so stubborn.

34:58.250 --> 35:01.540
- Well, hey, no.

35:01.540 --> 35:03.250
I just hated seeing you in pain.

35:03.250 --> 35:04.880
I just wanted
to get it over with

35:04.880 --> 35:05.960
the quickest way I saw how.

35:05.960 --> 35:08.080
Come on.

35:13.580 --> 35:16.500
Your mama was a fighter.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.710
She passed that down to you.

35:19.710 --> 35:22.540
Listen...

35:22.540 --> 35:25.330
whatever you want to do,
you do it.

35:25.330 --> 35:28.080
I got your back.

35:28.080 --> 35:31.830
- I don't even know anymore.

35:31.830 --> 35:35.420
- All those people out there,

35:35.420 --> 35:38.500
they think they know you
from that video,

35:38.500 --> 35:40.080
but they don't.

35:40.080 --> 35:44.290
That's not the full picture.
Not by a mile.

35:44.290 --> 35:49.250
You are a wonderful,
generous, kind young woman.

35:49.250 --> 35:52.830
And I'm so proud to be your dad.

35:52.830 --> 35:56.250
I think you need to say
something in your own words.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.420
And you need to let them know
who you really are,

36:00.250 --> 36:02.580
All right?
- All right.

36:02.580 --> 36:04.380
I love you.
- Oh, I love you too, baby.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.710
- What's wrong?

36:30.120 --> 36:33.170
- I'm not sure
this is gonna work.

36:33.170 --> 36:35.290
- Okay, let's rewind a second.

36:35.290 --> 36:37.920
Wh-what...
What's going on?

36:37.920 --> 36:40.000
- (sigh) I just don't feel like

36:40.000 --> 36:43.120
I can be myself as a musician
and go out with you.

36:43.120 --> 36:46.040
And be loyal to my friends
at the same time.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.250
I can't give up on who I am...
- Time out.

36:48.250 --> 36:49.830
I love everything about you.

36:49.830 --> 36:51.120
I don't want to change you.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.710
- I'm a gay man who
plays country music.

36:56.710 --> 36:58.830
It's a tough deal.

36:58.830 --> 37:00.330
If I start singing about mops

37:00.330 --> 37:01.960
or fertilizer, or something
I mean, it's...

37:08.000 --> 37:10.040
What?

37:10.040 --> 37:12.880
- Ah, nothing.

37:12.880 --> 37:16.290
Just funny how
life works sometimes.

37:16.290 --> 37:18.790
Alyssa got a call
about you today.

37:18.790 --> 37:21.000
But I'm definitely
not talking about it now.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.580
- Well, what was it?

37:22.580 --> 37:25.290
- Never mind.
- No! You gotta tell me now!

37:25.290 --> 37:26.420
- You're the one who said
you didn't want

37:26.420 --> 37:29.830
to sing about mops, right?

37:29.830 --> 37:34.920
Budweiser, the King of Beers.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.330
Already working
with Thomas Rhett

37:36.330 --> 37:38.210
and Florida Georgia Line.

37:38.210 --> 37:39.920
And now they want you.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.500
- W-w-what?
- Yeah.

37:41.500 --> 37:44.330
Imagine John Wayne
coming out of the closet.

37:44.330 --> 37:47.290
An openly gay man portrayed as
the pinnacle of masculinity.

37:47.290 --> 37:49.330
- Budweiser wants
to work with me?

37:49.330 --> 37:52.420
- Yes, he said it again. Yes!

37:52.420 --> 37:53.790
Will, it would be historic.

37:53.790 --> 37:55.670
- Damn.

37:55.670 --> 37:57.080
- Yeah. But, you know,
let's not talk about it.

37:57.080 --> 38:00.250
Because it is
selling mops, right?

38:00.250 --> 38:02.710
- Damn.

38:02.710 --> 38:04.830
- Just stop.
- (laughing)

38:04.830 --> 38:06.120
- Hey, Daph?
- Yeah, what's up?

38:06.120 --> 38:08.420
- Can you come
help me with something?

38:16.750 --> 38:18.830
Hi.
My name is Maddie Jaymes.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.620
If you know who I am,
it's probably because

38:20.620 --> 38:23.880
of a video that's being
going around for the past week.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.330
And that's what
I want to talk about.

38:25.330 --> 38:28.580
I know that I used
some bad language.

38:28.580 --> 38:30.620
And I used it
towards a police officer.

38:30.620 --> 38:33.040
And I'm sorry for that.

38:33.040 --> 38:36.540
I understand that he was trying
to do a very difficult job.

38:36.540 --> 38:39.290
And he did his best
under the circumstances.

38:39.290 --> 38:40.790
Even if I had a problem with it.

38:40.790 --> 38:42.210
And I escalated a situation

38:42.210 --> 38:44.540
that was already
a pretty tense one.

38:44.540 --> 38:47.000
And I apologize for that too.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.290
But I'm not sorry for trying
to protect my friend.

38:51.290 --> 38:52.500
His name is Clayton.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.120
And because of what happened,

38:54.120 --> 38:57.000
a lot of terrible things have
been said about him.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.620
And I really just
want to clear that up.

38:59.620 --> 39:01.210
He is not my boyfriend.

39:01.210 --> 39:05.290
He is an artist,
an incredible one.

39:05.290 --> 39:07.830
And one of the kindest,

39:07.830 --> 39:10.120
most sensitive people
that I've ever met.

39:10.120 --> 39:13.790
And I'm sure if you met him,
you would feel the same way.

39:13.790 --> 39:17.670
And my actions
have caused him pain.

39:17.670 --> 39:19.830
So, Clayton,
