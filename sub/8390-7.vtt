VERY GOOD.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.403

00:47.180 --> 00:49.592

YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG AGAIN.

00:55.190 --> 00:56.282
- YEAH,
I'M AWARE OF THAT.

00:56.330 --> 00:58.218

01:02.680 --> 01:04.159

01:04.200 --> 01:05.292
[laughing]
- WELL, JABBAR...

01:05.340 --> 01:08.229
I THINK THIS IS WHAT
THE YOGIS WOULD CALL FATE, HMM?

01:08.270 --> 01:11.194
WOULD YOU BOYS LIKE
TO COME OVER FOR A PLAY DATE?

01:11.240 --> 01:13.822
IF THAT'S
OKAY WITH YOUR DAD.

01:13.860 --> 01:15.270

01:39.960 --> 01:41.291
- NO, MOM.
- THEY'RE PERFECT.

01:41.340 --> 01:43.194
- NO, MOM.
MOM, YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

01:43.240 --> 01:46.334
AUNT JULIA WORKS IN
A REAL OFFICE.

01:46.380 --> 01:47.517
- I WORE THESE

01:47.550 --> 01:49.199
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- [sigh]

01:49.240 --> 01:51.231
IT'S CAREER WEEK, AND
I GET TO TAKE MONDAY OFF

01:51.280 --> 01:53.202
TO SHADOW SOMEBODY IN
THE CAREER OF MY CHOOSING.

01:53.250 --> 01:54.865
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH MY CAREER?

01:54.900 --> 01:57.414
- I CAN REALLY ANSWER
THAT IF YOU WANT.

01:57.460 --> 01:59.519
- AH! HA-HA!

01:59.560 --> 02:00.766
- OKAY.

02:00.810 --> 02:02.835

02:06.190 --> 02:07.259
- HERE WE GO.

02:07.290 --> 02:09.872
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE
BRAVERMAN FAMILY FUN THINGS,

02:09.920 --> 02:10.989
AND I'M NOT DOING IT.
- YES, IT IS.

02:11.020 --> 02:13.295
- WELL, I'M GOING TO
A MOVIE AT 5:00 WITH STEVE,

02:13.340 --> 02:14.773
AND MOM ALREADY

02:14.820 --> 02:16.401
- SORRY.
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:16.440 --> 02:17.509
IT'S FINE,
WE STILL HAVE AN HOUR

02:17.550 --> 02:18.778
FOR BRAVERMAN
FAMILY BONDING.

02:18.820 --> 02:20.617
YOU GUYS MOUNT UP,
I'M GONNA GO GET THE BOY.

02:20.650 --> 02:22.709

02:22.760 --> 02:24.409
- NO, HE DOESN'T.

02:24.450 --> 02:26.372
IT'S ON A GIGANTIC SCHEDULE
IN THE KITCHEN,

02:26.420 --> 02:28.411
AND IT'S HARD TO MISS.
- I'M SORRY, HONEY.

02:28.450 --> 02:30.452
WE CAN DO THIS ANOTHER TIME.

02:30.490 --> 02:33.550
WE GOT 20 MINUTES.
WE'RE GONNA GO AROUND THE BLOCK.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.522
- HONEY, WE CAN
DO THIS ANOTHER TIME.

02:35.560 --> 02:36.936
- MOM.
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

02:36.980 --> 02:38.902
HE HAS TO STICK
TO THAT SCHEDULE.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.520
- I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD STOP RIGHT NOW.

02:40.570 --> 02:41.844
- [sighs]

02:41.880 --> 02:43.700
YOU'RE GONNA GET PAID
FOR THE ENTIRE SESSION.

02:43.740 --> 02:45.367
COME ON, IT'S AN ENTIRE
SUNDAY AFTERNOON OFF.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.469
I'M SURE THERE
ARE PLENTY OF OTHER THINGS

02:46.510 --> 02:47.329
YOU'D RATHER BE DOING.

02:47.370 --> 02:48.576
- WE'RE REALLY
MAKING STRIDES WITH

02:48.610 --> 02:49.713
HIS STICKER SYSTEM RIGHT NOW

02:49.750 --> 02:50.978
AND I'D HATE TO DERAIL
ALL THAT HARD--

02:51.030 --> 02:52.190
- GABY.
- GABY?

02:52.240 --> 02:55.368
I FINISHED MATH, CAN I HAVE
MY SPIDERMAN STICKERS NOW?

02:55.410 --> 02:56.957
- HOW YOU DOING, PAL?

02:57.000 --> 02:59.207
- ACTUALLY, MAX,
THE DEAL WAS

02:59.240 --> 03:01.891
YOU FINISH MATH AND READING,
AND YOU GET YOUR STICKERS.

03:01.940 --> 03:03.692
- OKAY, CAN
WE START READING THEN?

03:06.600 --> 03:08.283
- GET TO IT.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.424
- YEAH. IT'S NICE.

03:14.470 --> 03:16.256
IT'S NICE TO LIVE HERE.

03:16.290 --> 03:17.769
AND OF COURSE,
WHAT 38-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

03:17.810 --> 03:20.324
DOES NOT ENJOY LIVING
AT HOME WITH HER PARENTS?

03:20.370 --> 03:21.439
- [chuckles]
- THAT'S A REAL...

03:21.470 --> 03:24.507
- SOUNDS FUN.

03:24.540 --> 03:25.711
- I JUST TOLD YOU
HOW OLD I AM.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.263
- THAT'S OKAY.

03:27.310 --> 03:28.334
ALL RIGHT, I--YOU'RE--

03:28.380 --> 03:29.574
YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER
WHO'S A JUNIOR,

03:29.620 --> 03:31.929
I KIND OF ASSUMED YOU DIDN'T
HAVE HER WHEN YOU WERE TEN.

03:31.970 --> 03:34.347
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.826
YOU WAN NA KNOW ACTUALLY
WHAT I WAS THINKING JUST THERE?

03:36.870 --> 03:39.031
- YES.
- YOU'VE HAD YOUR ARMS CROSSED

03:39.080 --> 03:40.581
FOR ALMOST THIS ENTIRE WALK,

03:40.630 --> 03:42.313
AND I REALLY
WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND,

03:42.360 --> 03:44.521
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO
THAT WHEN THEY'RE LIKE THAT.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.425
DO I TRY TO GO FOR THAT ONE,
OR THAT--I MEAN, IT'S...

03:46.460 --> 03:48.519
SO I DON'T KNOW IF--
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

03:48.570 --> 03:50.538
SEE, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

03:50.570 --> 03:53.289
YOU'RE--YOU'RE SO GOOD.

03:53.330 --> 03:54.740
- I'VE GOT
12 YEARS ON YOU.

03:54.780 --> 03:57.294
- THAT's TRUE.
- [glggleSJ

04:02.030 --> 04:03.065
- I'M SORRY.
- OH, SORRY.

04:03.100 --> 04:04.374
- NO, I'M SORRY.
- I'M SORRY.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.206
- I'M SORRY.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.616
I MISREAD
THE HAND-HOLDING THING.

04:06.660 --> 04:08.969
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.
COME HERE.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.481
- [clears throat]

04:12.520 --> 04:15.626
- IT'S JUST, UH...

04:15.660 --> 04:17.799
I JUST CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT AMBER.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.308
I LIED TO HER TODAY.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.669
I WAS GONNA TELL HER, AND THEN
SHE CALLED ME "PULCHRITUDINOUS."

04:22.710 --> 04:24.701
AND I GOT DISTRACT ED.

04:26.090 --> 04:27.466
OH, YOU THINK
THAT'S FUNNY?

04:27.500 --> 04:28.774
- NO, NO,
THAT MEANS BEAUTIFUL.

04:28.820 --> 04:30.321
PULCHRITUDINOUS.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.577
IT'S ONE OF HER S.A.T. WORDS.
- IT IS?

04:32.610 --> 04:35.670
- SHE USED IT APPROPRIATELY,
I'M PROUD OF HER.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.371
- THANKS.

04:38.410 --> 04:40.298
DUMB.
- NO.

04:40.340 --> 04:41.546
HERE'S A THOUGHT
ABOUT AMBER.

04:41.590 --> 04:44.559
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
TAKE, LIKE, A TEST RUN

04:44.590 --> 04:48.481
WHERE WE MAKE OUT, AND
WE JUST SEE HOW THAT GOES.

04:48.520 --> 04:51.318
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A TOTAL
WASTE IF WE TOLD AMBER

04:51.360 --> 04:54.693
AND THEN IT TURNS OUT THAT
WE ACTUALLY REPULSE EACH OTHER.

04:54.740 --> 04:56.594
- [mouths]
OKAY.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.039
[Amos Lee's Colors]

04:58.090 --> 05:04.325

05:04.370 --> 05:06.463
ALL THE COLORS FADE

05:06.510 --> 05:11.618
WHEN YOU'RE GONE

05:13.830 --> 05:19.791
YOU'RE GONE

05:19.830 --> 05:23.379
COLORS SEEM TO FADE

05:23.420 --> 05:24.557
- NOTHING.
- NO CHEMISTRY.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.908
- MM-MM.
- NO SPARK, NOTHING.

05:25.940 --> 05:27.077
- NOT A THING.
- JUST...

05:27.110 --> 05:28.623
WELL, LET ME
TRY IT ONE MORE TIME.

05:34.470 --> 05:36.870
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

05:36.920 --> 05:39.536
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

05:39.580 --> 05:41.889
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

05:41.920 --> 05:44.480

TO BE TRUE

05:58.840 --> 06:01.593
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

06:01.630 --> 06:03.598
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

06:03.630 --> 06:06.599
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

06:06.640 --> 06:08.562
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

06:08.600 --> 06:10.739
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:10.780 --> 06:13.431
FOREVER YOUNG

06:13.470 --> 06:15.745
MAY YOU STAY

06:15.780 --> 06:18.886
FOREVER YOUNG

WE'RE BURNING BILLABLE HOURS

IT'S SO SWEET OF YOU.
SHE'S SO EXCITED.

06:42.780 --> 06:44.429
- OH, GOOD.

STUDYING REALLY HARD.

07:24.230 --> 07:26.266
I'M EVEN USING MY WORDS
IN EVERYDAY SPEECH.

07:26.300 --> 07:29.952
YOU CAN CALL MY MOM AND ASK
FOR CORROBORATION IF YOU PLEASE.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.514
- WELL,
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

07:32.550 --> 07:36.099
BUT I WILL ASK YOU IF
YOU HAVE YOUR iPOD WITH YOU.

07:36.140 --> 07:37.823
- NO.

07:37.870 --> 07:40.486
THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED ON SCHOOL
GROUNDS, SO WHY WOULD I--

07:40.520 --> 07:43.034
- I KNOW YOU'RE PACKING,
I SAW YOU.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.867
- UNBELIEVABLE.

07:45.910 --> 07:48.561
JUST BECAUSE I MISS ONE WORD,
I'M ROBBED OF THE ONLY THING

07:48.600 --> 07:50.909
THAT PROVIDES DISTRACT ION
FROM THIS ORDEAL.

07:50.950 --> 07:53.009
- NO,
I'M NOT PUNISHING YOU.

07:53.050 --> 07:54.677
IN FACT,
I'VE BEEN REALLY IMPRESSED

07:54.710 --> 07:55.813
BY HOW HARD
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.193
SO I GOT YOU A LITTLE PRESENT.

07:58.230 --> 08:00.607
- WHAT IS IT?

08:02.960 --> 08:05.758
- [clears throat]

08:08.140 --> 08:09.653
- YOU MADE ME A PLAYLIST?

08:09.690 --> 08:11.726
- MM-HMM.

08:11.760 --> 08:15.207
SO FOR THE NEXT FIVE DAYS,

08:15.250 --> 08:18.834
YOU ARE GOING TO EAT, SLEEP,

08:32.960 --> 08:34.120

COLLECT DUST.

08:34.160 --> 08:35.195
- OKAY.

08:35.230 --> 08:36.743

08:36.790 --> 08:39.714
[doorbell rings]

08:39.760 --> 08:41.204

08:41.240 --> 08:44.653

08:45.900 --> 08:48.004
- I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS.
- YES, WELL...

08:48.040 --> 08:50.076
THE ONE PERK OF
CATCHING YOUR HUSBAND

08:50.110 --> 08:53.170
WITH AN H-O-O-K-E-R.

08:53.220 --> 08:54.664
- OH.
- WE HAVE A POOL.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.907
- MY DAD HAS AN OCEAN.

08:56.950 --> 08:58.941
- OH, JABBAR,
IT'S NOT POLITE TO BRAG.

08:58.980 --> 09:00.117
- [giggIeSJ
- IT'S MORE OF A MARINA

09:00.160 --> 09:02.674
THAN IT IS AN OCEAN.
- OH, OKAY.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.109
- WHOA.
- [glggleSJ

09:04.160 --> 09:07.084
MILO, WHY DON'T YOU GO
SHOW JABBAR THE TENNIS COURT?

09:07.130 --> 09:08.916
- OH, THE TENNIS COURTS.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.020
THAT'S--YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
HOW COMPETITIVE HE'S GONNA BE.

09:12.060 --> 09:15.029
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE HIM
ON THE COUNTRY CLUB CIRCUIT YET.

09:15.070 --> 09:16.640
- OH,_ PLEASE.
[glggleSJ

09:16.690 --> 09:18.169
MILO CAN BARELY
HOLD A RACQUET.

09:18.210 --> 09:21.680
MY EX HAS THIS IDEA
THAT HE'S GOING TO GROW UP

09:21.730 --> 09:23.345
TO BE A TENNIS STAR.

09:23.390 --> 09:26.655
SO WHAT ABOUT
YOU AND JABBAR'S MOM?

09:26.700 --> 09:30.045
ARE YOU GUYS COOL?

09:30.080 --> 09:31.968
IT'S A FUNNY STORY, ACTUALLY.

09:33.260 --> 09:35.592

09:35.640 --> 09:37.915

09:43.130 --> 09:44.609
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

09:44.650 --> 09:47.096
AH! JUMP IN THE POOL!
WOO-HOO!

09:48.790 --> 09:50.929

- [olggleSJ

09:50.960 --> 09:52.928
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

09:52.970 --> 09:54.198
- SO WHEN DID YOU FIRST
REALIZE

09:54.240 --> 09:55.867
THAT YOU WANTED TO BE
A LAWYER?

09:55.900 --> 09:57.959
- ALL RIGHT, I WAS
IN A CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS

09:58.010 --> 10:00.103
WHEN I WAS AT STANFORD.
GO CARDINAL, BY THE WAY.

10:00.150 --> 10:02.311
PUT THAT IN YOUR REPORT,
IT'LL DRIVE YOUR CAL DAD NUTS.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.806
- OH, MY GOD, I WILL.
I'M SECRETLY A STANFORD GIRL.

10:04.840 --> 10:07.115
- SO...CIVIL RIGHTS CLASS.

10:07.150 --> 10:09.186
IT WAS ALL ABOUT
THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS

10:09.220 --> 10:10.664
THAT WE HAVE AS CITIZENS.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.871
AND THE WAY THAT
WE'RE ALL PROTECTED EQUALLY

10:12.920 --> 10:14.057
UNDER THE LAW.

10:14.090 --> 10:16.399
AND MAYBE IT SOUNDS CORNY,
BUT IT MEANT A LOT TO ME.

10:16.440 --> 10:20.160
- AUNT JULIA, I HAD NO IDEA
THAT YOU DID THAT KIND OF LAW.

10:20.200 --> 10:23.192
- WELL, UH...
[clears throat]

10:23.240 --> 10:25.162
NO, I DON'T, ACTUALLY.

10:25.210 --> 10:27.098
RIGHT NOW, ANYWAY.
- OH.

10:27.140 --> 10:28.448
WHAT KIND OF LAW
DO YOU DO?

10:28.480 --> 10:30.129
- HOW DO I EXPLAIN IT?

10:30.180 --> 10:32.000
YOU'VE HEARD THE TERM
"MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS?"

10:32.040 --> 10:33.007
- MM-HMM.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.179
- MY JOB DEALS WITH
THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS.

10:35.220 --> 10:36.972
CORPORATE STRATEGY,
CORPORATE FINANCE.

10:37.010 --> 10:39.114
IT'S THE BUYING, SELLING,
AND COMBINING OF COMPANIES.

10:39.150 --> 10:42.278
AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE CAN
PROVIDE THE ACQUIRED COMPANY

10:42.330 --> 10:44.116
WITH A BUY-OUT PACKAGE.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.299
- IS IT--IS IT
A LOT OF MONEY?

10:46.330 --> 10:48.321
- NOT IF I DO MY JOB RIGHT.

10:48.370 --> 10:49.917
- OH.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.679
- WAIT...MAYBE JUST--

10:51.720 --> 10:53.153
DON'T--DON'T INCLUDE
THAT PART.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.055
THAT'S--IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
THAN I JUST EXPLAINED.

10:56.100 --> 10:59.308
- THAN SCREWING SOME POOR SLOB
OUT OF HIS RETIREMENT?

10:59.340 --> 11:01.205
- WHAT?

11:01.240 --> 11:03.162
- PRETI'Y WOMAN!

11:03.210 --> 11:05.132
I WAS--I WAS
QUOTING JULIA ROBERTS.

11:05.180 --> 11:08.069
BUT DON'T WORRY, I KNOW THAT'S
NOT WHAT IT'S REALLY LIKE.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.285
- I WANT CHOCOLATE.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.799
- YOU WANT CHOCOLATE
OR VANILLA?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.148
[phone ringing]
- VANILLA.

11:15.190 --> 11:17.215
- VANILLA. OKAY.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.399
- OH, IT'S MY BROTHER.

11:19.430 --> 11:20.772
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

11:20.810 --> 11:23.153
- WELL, UH,
A COUPLE OF THINGS.

11:23.190 --> 11:24.293
NUMBER ONE,

11:24.330 --> 11:26.150
I HAVE TO CANCEL OUR WEEKLY
BASKETBALL GAME TONIGHT.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.269
I AM SORRY ABOUT THAT.

11:27.300 --> 11:28.506
AND NUMBER TWO,

11:28.540 --> 11:31.475
I NEED A RECOMMENDATION
FOR A HIP RESTAURANT.

11:31.510 --> 11:33.137
- ONE, THAT'S, LIKE,
THE EIGHTH TIME IN A ROW

11:33.170 --> 11:34.307
YOU'VE CANCELLED THE GAME.

11:34.340 --> 11:35.967
SO TECH NICALLY,
I DON'T THINK WE CAN

11:36.000 --> 11:37.410
REFER TO IT
AS "WEEKLY" ANYMORE.

11:37.450 --> 11:39.099
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT, JACKASS.

11:39.140 --> 11:40.414
- LISTEN, WHAT KIND OF "HIP"
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

11:40.450 --> 11:43.760
ANNIVERSARY HIP,
OR GUYS OUT ON THE TOWN HIP?

11:43.800 --> 11:45.210
- NO, IT'S JUST THESE TWO
RETAIL CLIENTS

11:45.250 --> 11:46.729
ARE IN FROM OUT OF TOWN,

11:46.770 --> 11:47.839
AND SOMEBODY HAS
TO SHOW THEM A GOOD TIME.

11:47.870 --> 11:49.212
I DREW THE SHORT STRAW.

11:49.260 --> 11:51.069
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
THE RIGHT GUY FOR THE JOB?

11:51.120 --> 11:52.849
- YEAH, VERY FUNNY.
- WRITE THIS DOWN.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.496
TAKE THEM TO CASA VILLA
ON SAN PABLO.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.531
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

11:57.570 --> 11:58.912
- WELL, THEY'LL LOVE IT.

11:58.950 --> 12:01.885
YOU'LL TOLERATE IT, OKAY?
- THANKS.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.330
- YEAH, NO, NO.
- CAN WE GET TWO?

12:03.370 --> 12:04.473
- NO, NO, WE'LL
GET IT AT THE TABLE.

12:04.510 --> 12:06.239
WE'RE GOOD, WE'RE GOOD.
HI, HI.

12:06.270 --> 12:07.339

12:10.830 --> 12:12.513
- OKAY.

12:12.550 --> 12:14.415

12:16.870 --> 12:18.178
HEY, HONEY, WHAT'S UP?

12:18.220 --> 12:20.211
- HEY, HONEY, CAN YOU
GET OUT OF YOUR DINNER?

12:20.250 --> 12:22.286
- UH, WHY--WHY, WHAT?
SOMETHING HAPPENED?

12:22.320 --> 12:24.356
- NO, NO, THERE'S
A THREE-HOUR BUG MOVIE

12:24.390 --> 12:25.459
PLAYING AT THE IMAX,

12:25.500 --> 12:28.913

13:17.240 --> 13:18.468
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

13:18.520 --> 13:19.828
- UM, ACTUALLY, I'M SORRY,

13:19.860 --> 13:21.373
BUT IT WAS A FALSE ALARM,
OKAY?

13:21.420 --> 13:23.445
MAX HAD A MELTDOWN
DURING ONE OF THE TRAILERS,

13:23.490 --> 13:24.559
SO THEY CAME HOME EARLY.

13:24.590 --> 13:26.205
I'M JUST CALLING
TO SEE IF YOU PICK UP

13:26.250 --> 13:27.342
SOME CORNFLAKES
ON THE WAY HOME.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.039

HAVE CORNFLAKES.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.479
I GOT CORNFLAKES,

13:35.220 --> 13:36.494
MAX SAID THAT

PUT SOME PANTS ON--

14:22.130 --> 14:23.472
- I'M DONE.
- 'CAUSE GABY'S

14:23.510 --> 14:24.613
GONNA BE HERE ANY MINUTE--
WAIT, CLEAN UP YOUR STUFF.

14:24.650 --> 14:26.641
- NOPE.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.544
- I THINK GABY MIGHT
BE CALLING IN SICK TODAY.

14:28.590 --> 14:30.683
- REALLY? WHY'S THAT?

14:30.730 --> 14:33.107
- WELL, I SAW HER
AT THE BAR LAST NIGHT.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.414
- YOU SAW GABY
AT THE BAR LAST NIGHT?

14:34.450 --> 14:35.553
- MM-HMM.
- WHAT?

14:35.590 --> 14:37.171
SHE'S NOT EVEN
OLD ENOUGH TO DRINK,

14:37.220 --> 14:38.903
HOW COULD YOU SEE HER AT--
- OH, YEAH, SHE IS.

14:38.940 --> 14:40.692
AND IF TWO MARGARITAS
CAN DO THIS TO ME,

14:40.740 --> 14:43.015
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
WHAT TEN TEQUILA SHOTS

14:43.050 --> 14:45.518

14:45.570 --> 14:47.947
STICKER SYSTEM GABY WAS
SHOOTING TEQUILA LAST NIGHT?

14:47.990 --> 14:49.981

A GIRLS GONE WILD VIDEO.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.362
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW HOW

14:51.400 --> 14:53.459
SHE CAN SPEND ALL DAY
DEALING WITH KIDS LIKE MAX,

14:53.510 --> 14:55.125
AND THEN JUST
LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND.

14:55.170 --> 14:56.023
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:56.060 --> 14:57.925
THAT SHE LEAVES HERE,
AND GOES HOME,

14:57.960 --> 14:59.188
AND THINKS
ABOUT MAX ALL NIGHT?

14:59.240 --> 15:00.400
I MEAN,
SHE HAS A LIFE, YOU KNOW.

15:00.450 --> 15:02.304

I DON'T WANT HER AROUND MAX
IN CASE SHE'S LOOKING LIKE--

15:10.530 --> 15:12.930

16:03.750 --> 16:06.787
IT'S LIKE--LIKE,
HER SECRETARY IS A DUDE.

16:06.820 --> 16:08.162
FIRST OF ALL.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.680
AND EVERYBODY
CALLS HER "MS. BRAVERMAN."

16:10.720 --> 16:13.792
IT'S LIKE SHE'S HER OWN
POWERFUL WOMAN, YOU KNOW?

24:25.290 --> 24:27.622
OR SHOULD I HITCH ONE

24:31.640 --> 24:33.528

EXCELLENT SOUND SYSTEM.

24:38.540 --> 24:39.950

24:39.990 --> 24:42.026

GARRU LOUS.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.894
AS IN "PRINCIPAL GRAYSON

24:50.930 --> 24:52.659
- UH...

WHAT ARE YOU, STUDYING?

24:54.040 --> 24:56.656
- YEAH, I'M STUDYING.
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

24:56.700 --> 24:58.520
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.458
- IT'S FINE.

24:59.490 --> 25:01.310
OKAY, I HAVE

25:01.360 --> 25:03.009

AND SO MY ENGLISH TEACHER
MADE ME A MIX TAPE

25:05.640 --> 25:07.847

25:10.850 --> 25:13.318

THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S GREAT.

25:25.590 --> 25:26.579
I'M REALLY
HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

25:26.620 --> 25:27.939
- CAN WE LISTEN
TO SOMETHING ELSE?

25:27.970 --> 25:29.198
- YEAH, SURE. ACTUALLY,

25:29.250 --> 25:30.649
RIGHT HERE. LngITEN TO THIS.

25:30.700 --> 25:32.213
- YOU LIKE VAN HALEN?

25:40.050 --> 25:41.119
- [sighs]

25:41.160 --> 25:42.320
- SO...

25:42.360 --> 25:44.703
- IT'S SO NICE.
- THANKS.

25:47.090 --> 25:49.365
- [clears throat]
UM. . .OKAY.

25:49.400 --> 25:52.289
SO...

25:54.790 --> 25:56.610
HERE IT IS.

25:56.650 --> 25:58.618
- THE SOUND AND THE FURY.
[chuckles]

25:58.660 --> 26:00.855
ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
- YES, I KNOW.

26:00.900 --> 26:04.620
- I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE.
- YES, I KNOW YOU HAVE.

26:04.660 --> 26:06.207
DO YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

26:06.250 --> 26:09.242
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

26:09.290 --> 26:12.145
- SO THEN WHAT IS THIS?

26:12.190 --> 26:14.329
LIKE, THE ENGLISH
TEACHER'S VERSION OF

26:14.360 --> 26:17.011
"HEY, BABY, COME
OVER TO MY APARTMENT.

26:17.050 --> 26:18.847
I'LL SHOW YOU
MY ETCHINGS," HUH?

26:18.880 --> 26:21.701
- NO, UM.
THAT'S MY...

26:21.750 --> 26:24.196
THAT'S MY COPY
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

26:24.230 --> 26:25.219
- AH.

26:25.270 --> 26:27.363
- AND IF YOU
TURN TO PAGE 47,

26:27.410 --> 26:30.231
YOU'LL SEE WHAT PARAGRAPH
I HIGHLIGHTED

26:30.270 --> 26:31.680
WHEN I WAS 17 YEARS OLD.

26:31.720 --> 26:32.891
THAT'S WHAT
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU.

26:32.930 --> 26:34.238
- OH.

26:34.280 --> 26:35.656
MM.

26:35.690 --> 26:38.818
HM, HM, HM.

26:38.870 --> 26:40.724
[gasp5]

26:44.810 --> 26:47.278
"CADDY GOT THE BOX,
AND SET IT ON THE FLOOR,

26:47.320 --> 26:51.359
"AND OPENED IT.
IT WAS FULL OF STARS.

26:51.400 --> 26:55.018
"WHEN I WAS STILL,
THEY WERE STILL.

26:55.060 --> 26:56.914
"WHEN I MOVED,

26:56.960 --> 27:00.669
THEY GLINTED AND SPARKLED.

27:00.720 --> 27:04.781
I HUSHED."

27:04.830 --> 27:06.752
- USE THE TRUTH

27:06.790 --> 27:08.894
AS A WEAPON

27:11.350 --> 27:12.749
THAT'S WHAT
I WROTE MY PAPER ABOUT.

27:12.800 --> 27:13.869
- I KNOW.

27:13.900 --> 27:17.791
- THAT AMBER PLAGIARIZED.
- I KNOW.

27:17.840 --> 27:20.149
SO TELL ME THAT
THAT ISN'T WEIRD.

27:20.190 --> 27:21.145
- IT'S WEIRD.
- YEAH.

27:21.190 --> 27:23.658
TWO PEOPLE FROM
TWO DIFFERENT HIGH SCHOOLS.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.189
HUNDREDS OF MILES--
- DECADES APART.

27:25.220 --> 27:26.778
[laughing]

27:26.810 --> 27:29.187
- THAT WE PINPOINTED
THE EXACT SAME PARAGRAPH

27:29.230 --> 27:30.777
IN THAT BOOK.

27:30.820 --> 27:32.014
- [sighs]

27:32.060 --> 27:34.711
- THAT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.
- THAT IS WEIRD.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.160
- THAT'S SO WEIRD.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.816
- BUT I LOVE THAT PART.
- I KNOW.

27:38.860 --> 27:42.068
- THE BOX OF STARS IS SUCH
A GOOD METAPHOR FOR CADDY.

27:42.100 --> 27:45.888
- YEAH.
BRIGHT AND--AND BURNING.

27:45.940 --> 27:48.829
- BUT SHE'S CLOSED OFF

27:48.870 --> 27:51.077
IN A DARK,
CLAUSTROPHOBIC PLACE.

27:51.110 --> 27:55.069
- BUT SHE'S LIGHTING UP
EVERYBODY AROUND HER.

28:18.070 --> 28:20.447
- SEDUCED ME WITH
THE SOUND AND THE FURY.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.139
- [chuckles]

28:22.180 --> 28:25.479
IT WORKS_EVERY TIME.
- [olggleSJ

28:34.980 --> 28:36.299
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU.

28:36.330 --> 28:37.979
HEY.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.430
- HI, CAN I HAVE
A CHOCOLATE MILKSHAKE, PLEASE?

28:41.470 --> 28:42.789
THANK YOU.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.052
- HI.

28:46.100 --> 28:47.192
- WHY SO EARLY?
- I JUST--

28:47.240 --> 28:48.446
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO SQUEEZE IN THIS WALK

28:48.480 --> 28:49.856
WITH CHRISTINA ALL WEEK.

28:49.900 --> 28:51.515
AND JUST THAT
SIMPLE ACT REQUIRES

28:51.550 --> 28:53.370
THAT I GET TO WORK EARLY,
SO I CAN GET HOME EARLY,

28:53.420 --> 28:56.002
BEFORE GABY'S
DONE WORKING WITH MAX.

28:56.040 --> 28:57.792
- WOW.
- I KNOW.

28:57.830 --> 28:59.172
HERE'S WHAT
I WAN NA TALK ABOUT.

28:59.220 --> 29:00.869
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING

29:00.910 --> 29:03.219
WITH YOU
AND AMBER'S TEACHER.

29:03.250 --> 29:04.979
- HIS NAME IS MARK.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.978
- WELL, I DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

29:07.020 --> 29:09.159
- WELL...
- THANK YOU.

29:09.190 --> 29:12.466
- THANK YOU FOR
THE UNWANTED ADVICE.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.296
- SARAH.

29:13.330 --> 29:14.911
- IS THAT WHY WE GOT UP
SO EARLY?

29:14.960 --> 29:16.951
FOR YOU TO TELL ME--
- SARAH, LISTEN.

29:16.990 --> 29:19.231
- THAT I SHOULDN'T BE HAPPY?
- WHEN I GAVE AMBER A RIDE HOME

29:19.270 --> 29:20.885
LAST NIGHT,
IT WAS PRE'ITY CLEAR TO ME

29:20.930 --> 29:23.069
SHE HAS A MAJOR CRUSH
ON THE GUY.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.994
- NO, SHE DOESN'T.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.371
- YES, SHE DOES.

29:28.420 --> 29:30.035
YOU REMEMBER WHEN
YOU WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL

29:30.070 --> 29:31.822
AND YOU HAD THAT
CRUSH ON MR. LIVITSKY?

29:31.870 --> 29:33.906
HOW WOULD YOU HAVE FELT IF
MOM SLEPT WITH MR. LIVITSKY?

29:33.940 --> 29:35.794
- OH, GROSS!
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.558
- NO, ADAM, IT'S DIFFERENT.
MOM WAS MARRIED.

29:37.600 --> 29:40.592
- IT'S NOT DIFFERENT.
- AND MOM WAS MOM.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.017
- SARAH.

29:43.050 --> 29:45.393
LOOK, I JUST DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU FALL INTO ANOTHER...

29:45.430 --> 29:47.250
- ANOTHER FAILURE?
- NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:47.300 --> 29:50.087
- 'CAUSE NOTHING I DO
EVER WORKS OUT.

29:50.130 --> 29:51.882
- NO, NO, NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEVER MIND, NEVER MIND.

29:51.920 --> 29:52.955
FORGET ABOUT IT.

29:52.990 --> 29:56.062
I JUST--I SEE AMBER HAPPIER,
I SEE HER ENGAGED.

29:56.100 --> 29:57.579
AND I DON'T WANNA SEE
HER BACKSLIDE, THAT'S ALL.

29:57.620 --> 29:59.963
- I SEE THOSE THINGS.
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY GOOD PARENT.

30:02.070 --> 30:03.480
- OKAY, WOW.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.101
WELL, ALL I'M ASKING YOU
TO DO IS JUST--

30:05.140 --> 30:10.009
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING.

30:11.980 --> 30:13.459
I GO'I'I'A GO.
ENJOY YOUR MILKSHAKE.

30:19.330 --> 30:20.422

30:36.210 --> 30:38.030
I JUST CAME

30:47.910 --> 30:50.185
MET SOMEBODY.
- THAT'S GREAT.

30:50.220 --> 30:54.179
- BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.
IT'S SOMEBODY YOU KNOW.

30:54.230 --> 30:57.119
- WHO IS IT?

30:57.160 --> 30:59.435
- IT'S, UM...

30:59.470 --> 31:02.166
YOUR TEACHER.

31:02.200 --> 31:05.169
MR. CYR.

31:05.200 --> 31:07.259

- MR. CYR.

31:07.310 --> 31:10.689
- YEAH, WELL, I GUESSED
IT WASN'T MRS. HASBROOK.

31:10.730 --> 31:12.618
- NO, NOT WITH
THOSE ORTHOPEDIC SHOES.

31:12.660 --> 31:14.036
- [giggIeSJ

31:14.070 --> 31:15.446

31:15.490 --> 31:17.037

31:17.080 --> 31:21.619
- I KNOW,
I--I JUST WASN'T SURE.

31:21.670 --> 31:22.807
- IT'S GREAT.
I SAID IT WAS GREAT.

31:22.840 --> 31:26.526
- JUST A COUPLE TIMES, YOU KNOW.
I DIDN'T--IT WASN'T--

31:26.570 --> 31:28.709
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE
SURE THERE WAS SOMETHING...

31:28.740 --> 31:32.221
DO YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT?
- NO, NO, I JUST WANNA STUDY.

31:42.170 --> 31:44.138
[door closes]

31:49.250 --> 31:51.969
[Amber sobbing]

31:54.180 --> 31:56.284

32:01.050 --> 32:02.529
- 'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA
GO FOR A WALK, COME ON.

32:02.570 --> 32:04.743
COME ON, I'M HOME EARLY FROM
WORK, THE TRASH BINS ARE IN,

32:04.780 --> 32:06.463
AND MAX IS WITH GABY

32:06.510 --> 32:07.499
COME ON, LET'S GO!

32:07.540 --> 32:08.984
- OH, NO, HONEY,

32:09.030 --> 32:10.429
SHE LEAVES EARLY

32:10.480 --> 32:12.539

32:12.580 --> 32:13.717
- BYE, GABY.

32:13.750 --> 32:14.956
- HEY.
- HEY, GABY.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.345
- WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
MAKING A LITTLE OVERTIME TODAY?

32:18.380 --> 32:20.302
- OH, I CAN'T, I HAVE
ANOTHER FAMILY AT 7:00.

32:20.350 --> 32:22.170
- WELL, LOOK, THAT'S
NOT FOR ANOTHER TWO HOURS.

32:22.210 --> 32:24.007
I'M JUST LOOKING FOR ONE,
IT'S PERFECT.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.268
- RIGHT, IT'S
JUST REALLY IMPORTANT

32:25.320 --> 32:28.312
THAT I TAKE A BREAK
AND HAVE TIME TO MYSELF.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.486
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.213
- WE UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.729
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TODAY,
AND WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

32:32.770 --> 32:34.419
- SEE YOU TOMORROW.
- SEE YOU TOMORROW.

32:34.460 --> 32:36.109
- OH, I'LL CALL
YOU LATER ABOUT...

32:36.160 --> 32:37.388
- OH, YES.
- THANK YOU.

32:37.430 --> 32:38.601
- OKAY, BYE.
both: BYE.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.289
- WOW.
- SHE'S SO GREAT.

32:40.330 --> 32:41.979
- THAT'S GREAT, YEAH.
- SHE'S AMAZING.

32:42.020 --> 32:43.339
- YEAH, THAT'S GREAT THAT
SHE GETS SOME TIME TO HERSELF.

32:43.370 --> 32:45.019
MAYBE SHE CAN MAKE ANOTHER
DATE WITH JOSE CUERVO.

32:45.060 --> 32:46.334
- OH, GOD, ADAM, COME ON.
- IT'S GOOD YOU'RE

32:46.370 --> 32:47.302
BEING SO SUPPORTIVE
OF HER, THAT'S GOOD.

32:47.340 --> 32:48.614
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- NOTHING.

32:48.650 --> 32:50.163
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST FORGET IT.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.269
I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON MAX.
- OKAY, HE'S FINE.

32:51.310 --> 32:53.062
AND HE'S NOT THE ONE
I'M WORRIED ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.204
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
- WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

32:55.240 --> 32:57.242
- HONEY, YOU'RE
ALL WOUND UP, OKAY?

32:57.280 --> 32:59.589
IT MEANS THAT YOU NEED
TO TAKE SOME TIME FOR YOURSELF.

32:59.630 --> 33:01.769
GABY'S RIGHT, IF YOU
DON'T TAKE TIME FOR YOURSELF,

33:01.800 --> 33:03.734
YOU'RE GONNA SNAP.
YOU'RE ALREADY SNAPPING.

33:03.770 --> 33:05.522
DON'T DO THAT,
WE HAVE A SYSTEM SET UP.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.767
IF MAX CLEANS UP HIS TOYS,
HE GETS A STICKER.

33:07.810 --> 33:09.289
- OKAY, I'LL
JUST LIVE LIKE THIS.

33:09.330 --> 33:11.355
AND WHEN EXACTLY
AM I SUPPOSED

33:11.400 --> 33:13.493
TO SCHEDULE THIS
"ME TIME" FOR MYSELF?

33:13.540 --> 33:15.053
- ADAM, I DON'T KNOW.

33:15.090 --> 33:17.081
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE CAN
PUT IT ON THE DRY ERASE BOARD.

33:17.130 --> 33:19.155
- THE DRY ERASE BOARD
DOESN'T ACCURATELY REFLECT

33:19.200 --> 33:21.407
THE TIME SUCK THAT
IS MY FAMILY AND MY JOB.

33:21.440 --> 33:22.611
- HEY, THEY ARE ADULTS
AND THEY WILL MANAGE.

33:22.650 --> 33:24.231
- I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS,

33:24.270 --> 33:25.407
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE HAS A LIFE.

33:25.450 --> 33:27.372
YOU KNOW, CROSBY'S GOT A LIFE,
SARAH MOVES BACK HOME

33:27.410 --> 33:29.207
TO HAVE A NEW LIFE,
EVEN GABY'S GOT A LIFE.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.411
- YOU HAVE A LIFE.
- I DON'T HAVE A LIFE.

33:30.450 --> 33:32.031
YEAH, I DON'T
HAVE A LIFE, CHRISTINA.

33:32.070 --> 33:33.514
I HAVE A SCHEDULE.

33:33.560 --> 33:34.766
- YOU HAVE A LIFE.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.279
HOW DO YOU THINK
THAT MAKES ME FEEL?

33:36.320 --> 33:37.139
YOU HAVE A SCHEDULE...

33:37.180 --> 33:38.590
- CHRISTINA,
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

33:38.630 --> 33:39.801
- THEN WHY IS--
- I FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY'S

33:39.840 --> 33:41.592
TREATING ME LIKE A DAMN
HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE

33:41.640 --> 33:43.392
ALL THE TIME.
- OH, YOU TOO?

33:43.430 --> 33:45.227
- MAYBE IT'S ABOUT I'D LIKE
TO GO FOR A WALK WITH MY WIFE,

33:45.260 --> 33:48.229
BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE CROSBY
NEEDS TO CONSULT WITH ME

33:48.260 --> 33:49.670
ABOUT JABBAR,
OR KATIE, OR SARAH.

33:49.710 --> 33:51.393
OR YOU KNOW, HER KIDS
NEED A FATHER FIGURE.

33:51.440 --> 33:52.771
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO SAY NO TO THAT?

33:52.820 --> 33:54.401
- I DON'T KNOW.
- AND THEN MY OWN KIDS.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.328
TRYING TO GET HADDIE
INVOLVED WITH FAMILY TIME.

33:56.370 --> 33:58.065
OR MAX--GOD, I WISH
I KNEW WHAT TO DO FOR MAX.

33:58.100 --> 33:59.374
- STOP.

33:59.410 --> 34:00.377
- OR BEHAVIORAL AID.
- MAYBE WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

34:00.410 --> 34:02.446
MAYBE WHAT YOU NEED
TO DO IS TAKE A BREAK.

34:02.480 --> 34:05.301
- I CAN'T TAKE A BREAK!
- YES, YOU CAN TAKE A BREAK.

34:05.350 --> 34:06.794
TAKE A BREAK.

34:10.280 --> 34:12.669
[sniffles]

34:16.570 --> 34:18.253
[knocking]

34:20.540 --> 34:21.393
- HEY.
- HI.

34:21.430 --> 34:23.318
- HI.
- PLEASE COME IN.

34:27.680 --> 34:31.502
- HEY.
- HEY.

34:31.550 --> 34:36.135
- YOU KNOW, IN TWO YEARS,
AMBER'S GONNA BE GRADUATED,

34:36.170 --> 34:39.515
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE, UM, 30.

34:39.560 --> 34:41.107
YOU KNOW, ALMOST 30.

34:41.140 --> 34:42.448
[chuckles]

34:42.490 --> 34:46.551
AND, UH...I THINK
THAT MAYBE THAT'S THE TIME

34:46.600 --> 34:47.794
THAT WE SHOULD GO OUT NEXT.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.182
- WAIT.

34:49.220 --> 34:50.426
WAIT,
WHAT, WHAT. . .?

34:50.460 --> 34:52.143
- I'M ASKING YOU
TO GO OUT WITH ME.

34:52.190 --> 34:55.159
- IN TWO YEARS?

34:55.190 --> 34:59.889
ARE YOU--DID YOU
JUST BREAK UP WITH ME?

34:59.920 --> 35:01.603
- THIS IS JUST
THE BEST I CAN DO.

35:01.650 --> 35:03.436
- WHOA, SARAH, SARAH,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.879
THIS IS WORKING.
- NO.

35:04.930 --> 35:06.579
THIS IS NOT
THE PART OF MY LIFE

35:06.620 --> 35:07.757
THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE
WORKING.

35:07.790 --> 35:10.304
I MOVED HERE TO
TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY

35:10.340 --> 35:11.784
AND I'M DOING A TERRIBLE JOB.

35:11.830 --> 35:15.277
I'M SORRY,
BUT FOR NOW I JUST,

35:15.320 --> 35:16.799
I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING ELSE TO DO.

35:16.830 --> 35:19.344
- WAIT, WAIT.

35:19.390 --> 35:22.484
WAIT, I DON'T WANT
TO WAIT TWO YEARS FOR THIS.

35:22.530 --> 35:23.906
DO YOU?

35:23.940 --> 35:26.761
- THEN DON'T, OKAY?

35:26.810 --> 35:28.289
- NO, THAT'S
NOT WHAT I MEAN.

35:28.330 --> 35:31.538
SARAH, I...
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

35:31.570 --> 35:32.491
I--I REALLY LIKE YOU.

35:32.540 --> 35:34.917
- NO, I REALLY LIKE YOU.
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

35:34.960 --> 35:38.293
- OKAY, SO IT--

35:40.270 --> 35:42.613
WAIT, WAIT.
SARAH, SARAH.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.474
SARAH!

36:04.710 --> 36:07.679
[whirring noise]

36:09.440 --> 36:12.887
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:12.920 --> 36:14.364
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:14.410 --> 36:16.640
- HI, GOOD MORNING!

36:16.690 --> 36:18.715
DO YOU WANT SOME COFFEE?
I MADE SOME COFFEE.

36:18.760 --> 36:19.920
IT'S A BIG DAY.

36:19.970 --> 36:21.722
COME ON, TAKE SOME COFFEE
FOR THE ROAD.

36:23.380 --> 36:26.793
BUT JUST TODAY
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THIS.

36:26.830 --> 36:30.903
IT'S GOT ALL KINDS OF
MAGIC ENERGY AND STUFF IN IT.

36:30.940 --> 36:32.589
AND JUST PUT THAT
IN YOUR BAG, YOU KNOW?

36:32.630 --> 36:34.598
I'VE MADE THESE--
WELL, I DIDN'T MAKE THEM.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.562
BUT YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
TO USE A NUMBER TWO PENCIL,

36:36.600 --> 36:38.329
'CAUSE IF YOU USE ANOTHER--
YOU KNOW THIS PROBABLY--

36:38.360 --> 36:39.429
- I'M OKAY.

36:39.470 --> 36:42.223
- IF YOU DON'T--
YOU GOTTA--

36:42.260 --> 36:44.706
AMBER.

36:44.750 --> 36:47.719
AMBER!

36:52.580 --> 36:55.447

36:57.970 --> 37:00.484
[door opens and slams shut]

37:09.810 --> 37:11.869
- HEY, CROSBY.
- HEY, BUDDY.

37:11.910 --> 37:13.775
- SWEETIE, I WANT YOU
TO WAIT HERE FOR ME, OKAY?

37:13.810 --> 37:15.254
I NEED TO TALK TO CROSBY.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.870
- BUT CAN I GO?
- NO, STAY HERE.

37:16.920 --> 37:18.535
- BUT HE'S THERE.
- STAY HERE.

37:18.580 --> 37:20.673
STAY HERE.

37:20.720 --> 37:22.051
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

37:22.100 --> 37:24.716
- WHEN YOU ASK
TO SPEND TIME WITH JABBAR,

37:24.750 --> 37:27.514
I KIND OF EXPECT YOU
TO SPEND TIME WITH JABBAR.

37:27.550 --> 37:30.064
- I DID.

37:30.100 --> 37:31.749
- YOU'RE BUSTED.

37:31.800 --> 37:32.755
HE TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR PLAY DATE.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.722
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE TOLD YOU, BUT--

37:34.760 --> 37:37.695
- OUR SON IS NOT CHICK BAIT,
CROSBY, COME ON!

37:37.730 --> 37:39.072
- NOTHING HAPPENED.
- REALLY?

37:39.110 --> 37:41.283
- NO, I MEAN,
IT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

37:41.320 --> 37:42.696
BUT I STOPPED IT.
- YOU STOPPED IT?

37:42.740 --> 37:44.560
- YEAH, I HAD
A CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE.

37:44.600 --> 37:47.637
AND I MEAN, IT WAS KIND OF
A BIG LIFE MOMENT, ACTUALLY.

37:47.670 --> 37:49.979
- I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU HAD
A VALUABLE LEARNING EXPERIENCE

37:50.020 --> 37:52.329
WHILE LEAVING OUR FIVE-YEAR-OLD
SON ALONE IN THE POOL.

37:52.370 --> 37:54.645
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
- WHOA, HEY, JASMINE.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.853
I WANNA BE THE GUY
YOU THOUGHT I WAS.

37:56.890 --> 37:59.051
- BE IT.
- WELL, I'M TRYING.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.340
- MOMMY, AM I GONNA
STAY WITH CROSBY TODAY?

38:05.380 --> 38:06.893
- NOT TODAY, SWEETIE,
NOT TODAY.

38:06.930 --> 38:08.750
- WHY?
- BYE, BUDDY.

38:08.800 --> 38:10.688
- LOOK,
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

38:13.730 --> 38:15.425
- IF YOU WANT SOMETHING,
ASK ME.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.109
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO,
THEY USE THEIR WORDS.

38:17.150 --> 38:19.596
THEY DON'T USE
TELEPATHY OR SOMETHING.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.529
IT'S JUST THIS LOOK
THAT SHE DOES ALL THE TIME.

38:22.570 --> 38:23.776
AND I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN IT.

38:23.810 --> 38:27.814
- HADDIE, I WANT YOU
TO LOOK AROUND HERE.

38:27.850 --> 38:30.739
SEE THIS PLAY STRUCTURE
AND ALL THIS LANDSCAPING,

38:30.790 --> 38:32.542
AND THESE BENCHES HERE?

38:32.580 --> 38:34.400
- YEAH.

38:34.450 --> 38:36.509
- WELL, THIS COMPANY

38:36.550 --> 38:37.824
WANTED TO USE
EVERY INCH OF THIS LAND

38:37.860 --> 38:39.031
TO PUT UP OFFICES.

38:39.070 --> 38:41.550
AND YOUR MOTHER
STEPPED IN AND FOUGHT THEM.

38:41.590 --> 38:44.764
GOT THEM TO PUT UP $200,000
TO BUILD THIS LI'I'I'LE PARK.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.836
[children playing]

38:46.870 --> 38:48.758
WITHOUT HER,
THIS WOULDN'T BE HERE.

38:51.570 --> 38:53.765
- WOW.

38:53.810 --> 38:56.734
THAT'S SO
ERIN BROCKOVICH OF HER.

39:00.920 --> 39:04.026

[cell phone ringing]

39:39.990 --> 39:41.958
