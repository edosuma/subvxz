WEBVTT

00:20.754 --> 00:22.556
-
- Yeah.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.259
<i>Do you have</i>
<i>any idea what time it is?</i>

00:25.393 --> 00:27.795
Watched pot never boils, Francesca.

00:27.928 --> 00:29.630
<i>It's been an hour.</i>

00:29.763 --> 00:31.199
<i>You've got a lobby</i>
<i>full of people out here,</i>

00:31.332 --> 00:32.733
<i>and at eight o'clock,</i>
<i>I am done.</i>

00:32.866 --> 00:34.034
<i>I don't care if the building</i>
<i>burns down,</i>

00:34.168 --> 00:35.369
<i>I'm going home.</i>

00:35.503 --> 00:37.705
Wow, you and your work ethic.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.840
Did I ever tell you
how indispensable you are?

00:39.973 --> 00:41.109
No?

00:41.242 --> 00:43.211
<i>How much longer, Saul?</i>

00:43.344 --> 00:45.313
You know what? I can't say.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.481
So pass along
my sincerest apologies

00:47.615 --> 00:49.817
and tell 'em I'm swamped.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.952
<i>Everyone can hear you</i>
<i>bouncing that thing.</i>

00:53.621 --> 00:55.323
That's the sound of thinking.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.657
You should try it sometime.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.243
<i>Yeah?</i>

02:22.376 --> 02:23.644
What are you waiting for?

02:23.777 --> 02:25.379
Send her in.

03:21.569 --> 03:22.970
How's it coming?

03:23.103 --> 03:24.137
Good.

03:34.515 --> 03:35.883
Did you get the mayonnaise?

03:37.150 --> 03:38.852
Well, here's the thing,

03:38.986 --> 03:41.755
they didn't have Duke's,
and I really like Duke's.

03:41.889 --> 03:45.225
But they didn't have it,
which is a bummer. So...

03:47.295 --> 03:48.496
I dunno.

03:49.297 --> 03:50.298
Think this'll work?

03:51.899 --> 03:53.801
I mean, technically, it isn't
actually mayonnaise, but...

03:53.934 --> 03:55.202
Yeah,

03:55.336 --> 03:57.170
technically, I don't think
this <i>is</i> mayonnaise.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.171
But close, right?

04:00.408 --> 04:02.242
What do you think?
Should we give it a shot?

04:04.912 --> 04:06.680
I dunno. What do you think?

04:12.019 --> 04:13.487
Yeah.

04:13.621 --> 04:14.688
Let's give it a shot.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.828
["Escape

04:20.961 --> 04:22.229
Oh, my gosh.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.498
I don't know.
It's as close as I could get.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.801
Cissy, garnet and gold!
I see it plain as day.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.538
Plus, they're really
beautiful, Cissy.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.206
Ah, the red ones could
maybe pass for garnet.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.275
But the "gold" ones
are just regular yellow.

04:35.409 --> 04:38.312
Well, the minute I saw them
I said, "FSU!"

04:38.446 --> 04:41.081
Besides, gold food coloring?

04:41.214 --> 04:42.883
June, did you
ever even hear of that?

04:43.016 --> 04:44.685
No! Sounds expensive.

04:44.818 --> 04:45.719
And if they even
make such a thing,

04:45.853 --> 04:46.920
you'd probably
get flipper-hands

04:47.054 --> 04:48.522
from all the chemicals
they'd put in it.

04:48.656 --> 04:49.790
Well...

04:49.923 --> 04:51.759
This is as close
as I could get, anyway.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.961
- Oh, it's perfect, Cissy.
- Thank you.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.329
- Oh, my gosh.
- Ah, this is all so beautiful.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.864
- Everything looks amazing.
- Looks delicious.

04:56.997 --> 04:57.998
Oh, I forgot spoons. Sorry.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.099
Well, let me tell you
about epoxy--

04:59.232 --> 05:00.634
Epoxy yellows.

05:00.768 --> 05:01.602
You hit it
with enough sunlight...

05:01.735 --> 05:02.670
- No. Well--
- He's right.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.104
- Wait, no.
- No, he's right.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.073
If you just use
a dark enough floor--

05:06.206 --> 05:08.576
Guys, I'm telling you,
we're never gonna settle this.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.744
I've been having this argument
five days a week,

05:10.878 --> 05:12.245
but now I'm Sweden.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.747
- Switzerland.
- You want something to drink?

05:13.881 --> 05:15.282
- Wine coolers?
- Great. Cissy?

05:15.416 --> 05:17.084
Marvin doesn't
like me to drink.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.753
Cissy, we're gonna
get a wine cooler
down you one day.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.328
That was fun.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.763
Yeah. That <i>was</i> fun.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.343
-
- Yep.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.945
Yep.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.780
Yep.

05:46.914 --> 05:47.848
Yep.

05:49.282 --> 05:50.484
Yep.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.020
Yep!

05:53.153 --> 05:54.522
Yep.

05:54.655 --> 05:55.923
<i>That's it right there.</i>

05:56.056 --> 05:56.790
<i>Good job, guys.</i>

05:59.092 --> 06:00.861
<i>"Peter the Great</i>
<i>is buried inside me."</i>

06:00.994 --> 06:02.295
<i>-"Find me in..."</i>
- What did she say?

06:02.430 --> 06:03.597
<i>We're gonna</i>
<i>help each other.</i>

06:03.731 --> 06:05.666
Boy, you gotta be in shape
to be on this show.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.167
You sure do.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.502
Lotsa running.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.137
Yeah.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.239
You think they ever ran
with the bulls on this show?

06:12.372 --> 06:13.574
Like, in Spain?

06:14.842 --> 06:17.511
Not that we've seen,
I don't think.

06:17.645 --> 06:18.812
Maybe it's too dangerous.

06:22.249 --> 06:23.016
What do you think?

06:25.152 --> 06:26.053
Maybe.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.822
Maybe.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.503
Oh, I thought the potato salad
worked out great.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.404
- You think?
- Yep.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.107
Huh.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.509
Looks like rain again.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.745
Yeah. Does.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.586
Oh, hey, they opened
a new Outback

06:58.719 --> 06:59.620
down in Satellite Beach.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.388
- You wanna go Friday?
- Sure.

07:01.522 --> 07:02.556
-
- It's a date.

07:56.243 --> 07:59.279
Yes. Yes.

07:59.412 --> 08:02.816
I don't want to not buy
her toys, but I also...

08:32.913 --> 08:34.447
<i>Could you tell me</i>
<i>the flange diameter</i>

08:34.582 --> 08:36.950
of 212-dash-17-backslash-H?

08:38.251 --> 08:39.452
Great.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.288
And does that come in
a three-inch riser,

08:41.421 --> 08:42.189
or just the two-inch?

08:43.557 --> 08:44.692
Great.

08:44.825 --> 08:45.959
ABS or PVC?

08:47.460 --> 08:49.262
Oh. Great.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.080
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.415
We're gonna
sing at 5:00.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.250
Oh. Great.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.351
Let me see.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.994
That's cute, June.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.096
I'll pick up the cake
after lunch.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.565
Do you remember what kind
of ice cream Tammy likes?

09:25.699 --> 09:28.135
Uh... geez, no.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.237
Yeah. So maybe...
What do you think?

09:30.370 --> 09:31.605
Vanilla?

09:31.739 --> 09:32.572
Or strawberry?

09:32.706 --> 09:34.174
Ooh.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.075
Um...

09:39.046 --> 09:40.748
They're both good.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.249
I know, right?

09:44.551 --> 09:46.019
- Five o'clock.
- Okay, great.

09:48.521 --> 09:51.024
No,
nobody makes it that long.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.193
Well, I mean, because--
I mean, think about it.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.728
It's got to fit
in the truck, right?

09:54.862 --> 09:56.429
So, how's it gonna fit
in the truck if--

09:58.331 --> 10:00.233
Well, yeah, but nobody makes
a truck that long, so...

10:01.568 --> 10:02.636
Safe to say.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.574
Okay. Well, sorry
we couldn't be of service.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.443
So...
whatever happened to crack?

10:10.577 --> 10:12.813
How come you never hear
about it on the news anymore?

10:12.946 --> 10:15.248
Did everybody just all decide
to stop taking it?

10:15.382 --> 10:17.017
What's the drug that
makes you dance around

10:17.150 --> 10:18.318
and put a pacifier
in your mouth?

10:18.451 --> 10:20.087
- Ecstasy.
- Ecstasy!

10:20.220 --> 10:21.554
That's the big one now.
I think that they have--

10:21.689 --> 10:22.622
Yeah. That's the big one.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.191
My sister's best friend's son?

10:24.324 --> 10:25.325
Oh, my God...

10:25.458 --> 10:27.060
But I don't understand
the pacifier.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.896
Why would
they all need pacifiers?

10:29.029 --> 10:30.898
Like, don't you think
if you ran a store

10:31.031 --> 10:32.432
and some teenager
came in your store

10:32.565 --> 10:33.600
and tried to buy a pacifier,

10:33.734 --> 10:34.768
don't you think
you'd call the police?

10:34.902 --> 10:36.136
- Yeah.
- Pbht! I sure would.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.071
- Absolutely.
- Whatcha eating?

10:39.006 --> 10:40.674
Tuna salad.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.310
I made it with Miracle Whip
instead of mayonnaise.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.645
- Hmm.
- I use almond butter instead of pean--

11:17.244 --> 11:18.111
Mm.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.657
When I woke up
this morning,

11:30.791 --> 11:32.259
guess what was in
my living room.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.463
A freaking exercise bike.

11:36.596 --> 11:39.099
Yeah. I can't believe
he got that for my birthday.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.701
Hold on a second.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.206
Palm Coast Sprinkler,
watering your world since 1978.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.109
Please hold.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.712
<i>Yep?</i>

11:52.846 --> 11:54.647
Kim, there's
a Viktor St. Claire
for you on line three.

11:56.850 --> 11:57.818
Kim?

11:57.951 --> 11:59.652
<i>Uh, yep. Okay.</i>

12:01.621 --> 12:02.689
Yeah. So, what do you
think about that?

12:02.823 --> 12:03.623
That's pretty rude.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.728
What brand is it?

12:08.862 --> 12:10.563
I don't care who made it.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.132
I don't care
if it's Megatron 3000

12:12.265 --> 12:13.633
or worth $4 million.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.703
I'm gonna ride it
straight back to the store,

12:16.837 --> 12:18.171
and guess what he's gonna get
for his next birthday.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.174
Some hair regrowth serum,

12:21.308 --> 12:22.575
and
I'm gonna laugh at him.

12:23.844 --> 12:24.744
Yeah.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.401
Kim Wexler.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.003
<i>Hey, Kim.</i>

12:50.137 --> 12:51.071
<i>You know who this is?</i>

12:55.909 --> 12:57.210
<i>I'm gonna take that as a yes.</i>

13:00.147 --> 13:01.815
<i>Uh, that receptionist of yours,</i>

13:01.949 --> 13:03.250
<i>is she the type to listen in?</i>

13:05.018 --> 13:06.419
- No. <i>- Good.</i>

13:07.154 --> 13:08.721
<i>Okay.</i>

13:08.856 --> 13:11.591
<i>So, how's Florida</i>
<i>been treating you?</i>

13:11.724 --> 13:13.260
<i>I'm catching you</i>
<i>between hurricanes, I hope.</i>

13:15.896 --> 13:16.830
<i>Kim, you there?</i>

13:23.036 --> 13:24.071
What do you want?

13:26.406 --> 13:28.241
<i>I don't--</i>
<i>I don't want anything.</i>

13:29.342 --> 13:30.243
<i>I just...</i>

13:31.912 --> 13:33.346
<i>It's been a while, you know?</i>

13:33.480 --> 13:36.249
<i>Just-- I'm thinking</i>
<i>it's been a while,</i>

13:36.383 --> 13:39.252
<i>and, um, might be nice</i>
<i>to catch up.</i>

13:40.888 --> 13:42.822
- "Catch up." <i>- Yeah.</i>

13:42.956 --> 13:45.225
My mind was wandering
this morning. I was just...

13:45.358 --> 13:47.827
Not thinking anything
in particular.
Just random thoughts.

13:47.961 --> 13:51.764
And, bam,
it suddenly occurred to me
it's been six years.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.600
<i>I mean, Jesus.</i>

13:53.733 --> 13:54.902
<i>I, I couldn't believe it.</i>

14:03.743 --> 14:06.679
I thought you might wanna know
I'm still alive.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.450
Yep.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.853
I'm still out here,
still getting away with it.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.288
The feds couldn't find
their own ass

14:15.422 --> 14:17.090
with both hands
and a proctologist.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.425
You shouldn't be calling me.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.859
<i>Oh, hey! You're awake!</i>

14:21.161 --> 14:23.096
You shouldn't be calling.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.465
<i>Why not?</i>
<i>What, am I tying up the line</i>

14:25.598 --> 14:27.034
<i>for important</i>
<i>irrigation business?</i>

14:27.167 --> 14:29.002
<i>- I mean, come on, Kim.</i> <i>Say something.</i>
-

14:29.136 --> 14:30.837
You can call me an asshole,
yell at me.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.872
Just let me know
you've still got a pulse.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.177
<i>Just say something.</i>

14:39.947 --> 14:41.381
You want me to say something?

14:41.514 --> 14:42.916
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:43.050 --> 14:44.184
You should turn yourself in.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.320
<i>Do what?</i>

14:48.922 --> 14:49.923
You heard me.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.527
I don't know what kind of life
you've been living,

14:54.661 --> 14:55.528
but it can't be much.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.832
<i>Said the pot to the kettle!</i>

14:59.967 --> 15:01.334
<i>What-- That is--</i>

15:01.468 --> 15:05.572
<i>That is really rich, you--</i>
<i>You preaching to me?</i>

15:05.705 --> 15:09.742
<i>See, you have no idea</i>
<i>what I did or didn't do, okay?</i>

15:09.876 --> 15:12.345
<i>A-And why don't you</i>
<i>turn yourself in,</i>

15:12.479 --> 15:13.546
<i>seeing as how you're the one</i>

15:13.680 --> 15:15.115
<i>with the guilty conscience,</i>
<i>huh?</i>

15:15.248 --> 15:17.017
<i>What-- What is stopping you?</i>

15:17.150 --> 15:18.518
<i>Fring's in the ground.</i>

15:18.651 --> 15:20.520
<i>Mike's in the ground.</i>
<i>Lalo's in the ground.</i>

15:20.653 --> 15:21.955
<i>Apparently.</i>

15:22.089 --> 15:24.291
<i>You don't have to hold back</i>
<i>on my account.</i>

15:24.424 --> 15:26.893
<i>They can only hang me once.</i>
<i>So-- So go ahead.</i>

15:27.027 --> 15:29.696
<i>Spill your guts!</i>
<i>Put on your hair shirt,</i>
<i>see what it gets you!</i>

15:29.829 --> 15:31.531
<i>Why--</i>

15:31.664 --> 15:34.701
<i>Kim, why are we even</i>
<i>talking about this?</i>

15:34.834 --> 15:37.304
<i>We're both too smart to throw</i>
<i>our lives away for no reason.</i>

15:37.437 --> 15:38.371
<i>Just...</i>

15:39.572 --> 15:41.674
<i>I just... I only wanted to...</i>

15:43.710 --> 15:44.644
<i>Kim.</i>

15:47.914 --> 15:49.382
<i>Kim?</i>

15:52.185 --> 15:53.086
<i>Kim.</i>

15:53.220 --> 15:54.921
I'm glad you're alive.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.399
-
- Yeah?

16:07.667 --> 16:08.835
Time to sing!

16:08.968 --> 16:10.403
Okay.

16:19.112 --> 16:22.715
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

16:23.650 --> 16:28.255
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

16:28.388 --> 16:34.027
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Tammy ♪</i>

16:34.161 --> 16:39.332
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

18:24.304 --> 18:26.439
I can't leave before
the judge dismisses you.

18:26.573 --> 18:27.607
I'll make sure they're aware.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.542
Now, just remember
to sit up straight

18:29.676 --> 18:32.044
and listen carefully when
the judge addresses you.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.980
Stay attentive and engaged.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.417
Even if you're not so sure
what's going on, don't show it.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.752
All right. Come here.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.121
- Tuck your shirt in for me, will you?
- Okay.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.956
You gotta look good
for the judge.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.325
Because of your record...

19:12.585 --> 19:13.753
Kim?

19:13.886 --> 19:15.855
<i>Hi, Cheryl.</i>

19:15.988 --> 19:16.956
<i>I'm out front.</i>

21:38.365 --> 21:39.231
Howard was murdered?

21:45.738 --> 21:46.739
Why?

21:49.409 --> 21:50.443
He was...

21:53.780 --> 21:54.914
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

22:08.795 --> 22:09.796
Where's his body?

22:11.431 --> 22:12.632
I don't know.

22:16.302 --> 22:17.637
And the police?

22:17.770 --> 22:19.406
Will they search again?

22:19.539 --> 22:20.239
They'll search.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.779
I don't think they'll find him.

22:31.918 --> 22:32.985
Cheryl, he...

22:35.321 --> 22:38.357
It-- it all happened
in an instant.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.693
And he didn't--
he didn't suffer.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.668
"He didn't suffer."

22:52.472 --> 22:53.873
The lies you two made up.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.476
The picture you painted.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.113
That's all he is now.

23:01.247 --> 23:04.016
That's all anybody remembers.

23:07.353 --> 23:09.321
I want to change that.

23:09.456 --> 23:11.190
What happens now?

23:11.323 --> 23:13.325
Will you be tried?

23:13.460 --> 23:14.527
Will you go to jail?

23:16.062 --> 23:16.829
I don't know.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.399
You're a lawyer, right?

23:20.533 --> 23:23.903
You're a--
A great one, Howard said!

23:24.036 --> 23:25.438
How could you not know?

23:30.009 --> 23:32.812
Bernalillo County
has my affidavit.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.847
It's up to
the district attorney
whether to prosecute.

23:37.950 --> 23:38.851
And she may not.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.254
Why?

23:44.390 --> 23:46.859
There's no physical evidence.

23:48.394 --> 23:51.698
No remaining witnesses
other than my ex-husband,

23:51.831 --> 23:52.865
assuming he's still alive.

23:56.335 --> 23:57.770
I could sue you in civil court.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.238
I could take
everything you've got.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.111
Yeah.

24:10.817 --> 24:11.884
Why are you doing this?

26:14.206 --> 26:15.241
Oh, God!

29:17.223 --> 29:19.859
Passwords. Passwords...

32:28.880 --> 32:30.449
Hmm.

32:30.582 --> 32:31.650
A hat man.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.329
Holy shit.

34:36.375 --> 34:37.509
Nothing to see here.

34:40.346 --> 34:41.347
Move on.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.696
Look at this bullshit.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.532
Look.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.934
Look. What would you call this?

36:09.067 --> 36:10.502
I'd call that...

36:10.636 --> 36:12.338
I dunno, what?

36:12.471 --> 36:14.240
Would you call that
a fish taco?

36:14.373 --> 36:16.942
Could anybody
call this a fish taco?
I mean, legally?

36:17.075 --> 36:18.277
Stop waving that thing at me.

36:18.410 --> 36:19.778
Look at this!

36:19.911 --> 36:21.780
There's one piece
of goddamned pollock

36:21.913 --> 36:23.114
no bigger than
the end of my thumb.

36:23.249 --> 36:24.383
Now, how can you
even call that a--

36:24.516 --> 36:25.717
Like am I s'posed
to do something?

36:25.851 --> 36:26.785
What do you want me
to do about it?

36:26.918 --> 36:28.119
Well, I want you
to look inside there

36:28.254 --> 36:29.955
and tell me what you see.

36:30.088 --> 36:32.324
Huh? W-Would you
or would you not

36:32.458 --> 36:33.792
sell this to
an unsuspecting public?

36:33.925 --> 36:35.461
Why do you persist
in ordering fish

36:35.594 --> 36:37.195
when we're 1,400 miles away
from the nearest ocean?

36:37.329 --> 36:39.598
Because it's on the menu,
all right?

36:39.731 --> 36:41.967
Because I live in the 21st
goddamn century, all right?

36:42.100 --> 36:43.269
Mm.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.136
And this?
This is some bullshit.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.473
I'm telling you,
I got half a mind
to go on back over there

36:47.606 --> 36:49.107
and smack somebody
in their face there.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.714
-

38:03.582 --> 38:04.883
Yes!

38:59.037 --> 39:00.472
What do you think?

39:00.606 --> 39:02.307
Pretty great, right?

39:02.441 --> 39:03.208
Yeah, it's, um...

39:04.275 --> 39:05.944
Yep.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.814
I just need your printed name
and signature.

39:11.683 --> 39:15.286
So, Florida.

39:15.421 --> 39:17.188
Florida, Florida, Florida...

39:17.322 --> 39:18.857
Why there?

39:21.727 --> 39:23.962
- I guess--
- It doesn't matter.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.832
Doesn't have to make sense.

39:26.965 --> 39:29.835
Hey, I gotta tell you,
I think you're gonna regret

39:29.968 --> 39:32.571
not taking your share
of the Sandpiper money.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.372
That'd buy a shitload
of swampland.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.118
I will, um,

39:48.654 --> 39:49.988
file these tomorrow.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.223
All right. Well.

39:52.357 --> 39:53.492
Have a nice life, Kim.

40:25.891 --> 40:28.259
-

40:30.128 --> 40:32.063
Hey, Sweetcheeks,
who do we got next?

40:32.197 --> 40:33.932
Let's make some money!

40:34.065 --> 40:35.901
Emilio Koyama!

40:41.372 --> 40:42.407
Where's your paperwork?

40:42.541 --> 40:44.075
I don't do no paperwork.

40:45.410 --> 40:47.145
He doesn't do paperwork!

40:47.278 --> 40:48.780
Who cares? Come on, come on.

41:44.970 --> 41:47.338
Hey, yo, could I bum
one of those?

41:57.215 --> 41:57.949
Thanks.

42:03.655 --> 42:04.956
Mm.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.397
What's up with this shit?

42:15.433 --> 42:17.035
Rainy.

42:17.168 --> 42:20.872
Yeah. No. It-- It's crazy.

42:21.006 --> 42:22.974
It's like bananas,
all this rain.

42:25.076 --> 42:27.278
I mean, I thought we were,
like, in a desert, you know?

42:37.022 --> 42:37.989
You're a lawyer, right?

42:40.191 --> 42:42.560
Ah. I recognize you.

42:45.897 --> 42:47.365
You defended my buddy Combo.

42:48.667 --> 42:50.568
Christian Ortega.

42:50.702 --> 42:52.838
Juvie court,
stole a Baby Jesus.

42:52.971 --> 42:54.973
I mean, not like
a real baby, just a--

42:55.106 --> 42:58.376
You know, one of those things
outside of the church.

42:58.509 --> 42:59.978
- Nativity scene.
- Yeah.

43:00.111 --> 43:02.347
Knights of Columbus.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.717
I mean,
what the hell did he even
want that thing for?

43:05.851 --> 43:07.318
- Huh?
- I mean, I-- I still don't know.

43:07.452 --> 43:08.019
Dumbass.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.222
I told him he could go to Hell

43:11.356 --> 43:12.557
for stealing something
like that, I mean.

43:12.691 --> 43:14.025
But did he listen to me? No.

43:16.394 --> 43:20.198
But you, you got him off,
like, scot-free. That--

43:21.266 --> 43:23.368
That was pretty slick, yo.

43:23.501 --> 43:26.772
Well, tell him I hope
he's keeping his nose clean.

43:26.905 --> 43:28.039
Yeah, yeah, right on.

43:29.540 --> 43:30.441
Absolutely.

43:32.177 --> 43:33.611
Ah.

43:33.745 --> 43:36.114
Hey, so, you having all this
expertise and all...

43:37.716 --> 43:39.517
This guy Goodman?

43:40.585 --> 43:42.320
He the real deal?

43:42.453 --> 43:43.621
Like, lawyer-wise?

43:43.755 --> 43:44.823
Why do you ask?

43:49.560 --> 43:52.330
I got a buddy in there
who's facing some serious time.

43:52.463 --> 43:54.766
I mean, not-- you know,
not Baby Jesus-time,

43:54.900 --> 43:57.402
but... but serious.

43:57.535 --> 44:00.038
You know, he needs top-shelf
legal representation.

44:00.171 --> 44:01.807
And I tell him that, right?

44:01.940 --> 44:04.575
But, you know, he sees this
dude's commercials on TV

44:04.710 --> 44:06.644
and this is where
he wants to go.

44:06.778 --> 44:11.116
And I tell him, "Yo, Emilio,
you know, a funny TV commercial

44:11.249 --> 44:14.085
is not a sound basis
for, like, you know..."

44:15.420 --> 44:18.023
I mean, like, would you
go to doctor to do, like,

44:18.156 --> 44:20.425
an operation on you in like a--

44:20.558 --> 44:22.160
on, like,
your spleen or whatever

44:23.729 --> 44:25.964
on the fact of a funny
TV commercial?

44:26.097 --> 44:27.498
No. I mean, come on.

44:27.632 --> 44:29.400
How is this any different?

44:29.534 --> 44:30.668
You know?

44:35.140 --> 44:36.007
Anyway...

44:38.409 --> 44:40.578
Is this guy any good?

44:49.921 --> 44:51.356
When I knew him, he was.

47:12.097 --> 47:13.264
Hello?

47:13.398 --> 47:15.400
<i>Hey, uh, Dad?</i>

47:15.533 --> 47:17.768
<i>It's me. It's-- It's Jeff.</i>

47:17.903 --> 47:20.138
Jeff? What time is it?

47:20.271 --> 47:21.873
Are you okay?

47:22.007 --> 47:24.275
Yeah, no, not really.

47:24.409 --> 47:26.377
Um, I, uh...

47:26.511 --> 47:28.213
Dad, I got arrested.

47:28.346 --> 47:29.480
<i>Oh, no.</i>

47:29.614 --> 47:31.516
What for? Jeffie.

47:31.649 --> 47:33.451
<i>It's like this crazy mistake,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

47:33.584 --> 47:35.320
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I had an accident, okay?</i>

47:35.453 --> 47:38.456
<i>A, a little fender-bender</i>
<i>type deal, no, no big thing.</i>

47:38.589 --> 47:40.825
<i>My foot maybe slipped</i>
<i>on the accelerator,</i>

47:40.959 --> 47:43.995
or maybe it was
a defective-- I dunno.

47:44.129 --> 47:46.097
But that's not
the big-deal part.

47:46.998 --> 47:49.400
The big-deal part is,

47:49.534 --> 47:54.405
they think that I, me,
committed a robbery.

47:54.539 --> 47:56.241
<i>And why would they think that?</i>

47:56.374 --> 47:58.076
I know, right?

47:58.209 --> 47:59.410
<i>The place</i>
<i>where I had the accident?</i>

47:59.544 --> 48:01.246
<i>This guy? This drunk guy?</i>

48:01.379 --> 48:02.880
<i>He comes wandering</i>
<i>out of his house</i>

48:03.014 --> 48:05.816
<i>and flags down the cops,</i>
<i>the, the police, and says,</i>

48:05.951 --> 48:08.019
"Hey, you know, I got robbed!"

48:08.153 --> 48:10.121
And sure enough, the police?

48:10.255 --> 48:14.625
They find evidence of, like,
breaking and entering.

48:14.759 --> 48:18.329
And, and, and stuff is missing,
which I did not do.

48:19.664 --> 48:23.368
And, uh... yeah. Like that.

48:23.501 --> 48:26.537
Well, the police are obviously
barking up the wrong tree.

48:26.671 --> 48:28.206
Yeah. No shit, wrong tree!

48:28.339 --> 48:31.176
- Wrong, like, forest. <i>- Exactly.</i>

48:31.309 --> 48:33.511
<i>Because you would never do</i>
<i>something like that,</i>

48:33.644 --> 48:34.645
<i>would you, son?</i>

48:34.779 --> 48:37.348
No. No. No way, man.
Absolutely not.

48:37.482 --> 48:39.484
<i>Uh, when the police</i>
<i>took you into custody,</i>

48:39.617 --> 48:42.520
<i>did they find any of this</i>
<i>so-called stolen merchandise?</i>

48:42.653 --> 48:44.089
<i>Was it in your possession?</i>

48:44.222 --> 48:45.890
- No. <i>- Of course it wasn't.</i>

48:46.024 --> 48:48.226
Because you didn't
steal anything.

48:48.359 --> 48:52.097
Therefore, since there's
no evidence whatsoever
that you committed any crime,

48:52.230 --> 48:53.531
I'd say you got nothing
to worry about.

48:54.865 --> 48:56.301
<i>So, what happens next?</i>

48:56.434 --> 48:58.136
Breathe deep and sit tight.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.038
I'll have you out by lunchtime.

49:00.171 --> 49:02.107
<i>You coming down here yourself?</i>

49:02.240 --> 49:04.875
Nah, I think it'll be your mom.

49:06.211 --> 49:07.345
You'll talk to her for me?

49:07.478 --> 49:08.679
<i>I sure will.</i>

49:08.813 --> 49:10.381
<i>I'll straighten it all out,</i>
<i>no problem.</i>

49:11.582 --> 49:13.384
Yeah, okay. Good.

49:13.518 --> 49:16.921
<i>Jeff, you're gonna get</i>
<i>the best legal defense</i>
<i>in the whole wide world.</i>

49:17.055 --> 49:19.024
Trust your old man on that.

49:19.157 --> 49:21.292
<i>Okay, copy that. Sit tight.</i>

49:21.426 --> 49:22.893
You do that.

49:38.843 --> 49:39.910
Keep your shirt on.

49:41.346 --> 49:42.313
Hello?

49:44.515 --> 49:45.783
Gene.

49:45.916 --> 49:47.718
Gene, Honey,
do you know what time it is?

49:55.626 --> 49:58.296
Oh. Oh, God. That boy.

49:58.429 --> 50:00.198
He's gonna put me in my grave.

50:00.331 --> 50:02.033
Marion.

50:02.167 --> 50:03.634
It's a mistake, is all.

50:03.768 --> 50:04.969
Getting picked up
for something you didn't do?

50:05.103 --> 50:06.637
That could happen to anybody.

50:06.771 --> 50:08.273
<i>Yeah, right, anyone.</i>

50:08.406 --> 50:10.341
<i>This isn't</i>
<i>the first time, you know.</i>

50:10.475 --> 50:11.742
He's been in trouble before.

50:11.876 --> 50:12.810
Oh, Jesus.

50:12.943 --> 50:14.145
<i>- Marion...</i>
- The death of me.

50:14.279 --> 50:15.846
He's gonna be the death of me.

50:15.980 --> 50:18.983
Marion. Marion,
it's gonna be all right.

50:19.117 --> 50:21.352
We'll get him outta there
lickety-split.

50:21.486 --> 50:23.621
<i>I've been</i>
<i>through this before.</i>

50:23.754 --> 50:26.491
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>lickety-split about it.</i>

50:26.624 --> 50:29.160
Back when he was living
in Albuquerque?

50:29.294 --> 50:32.163
Drunk in public,
resisting arrest,

50:32.297 --> 50:36.301
urinating in
someplace he shouldn't have.

50:36.434 --> 50:40.004
And me on the telephone
for hours, long distance,

50:40.138 --> 50:42.973
<i>trying to find him one of those</i>
<i>bail-out places.</i>

50:43.108 --> 50:45.210
<i>I maxed out my Discover card.</i>

50:45.343 --> 50:47.312
<i>I'm still paying for that one.</i>

50:47.445 --> 50:48.613
Well, money's
not gonna be a problem,

50:48.746 --> 50:50.781
'cause I'm gonna
help you with that.

50:50.915 --> 50:53.118
No. Gene,
I can't let you do that. No.

50:53.251 --> 50:55.886
<i>Sure you can.</i>
<i>Jeff'll pay me back.</i>

50:56.020 --> 50:58.022
And you don't have to worry
about a bondsman, either.

50:58.156 --> 50:59.324
Because guess what?

50:59.457 --> 51:01.692
In Omaha, they don't have 'em.

51:01.826 --> 51:03.261
All right?
You just walk into the station

51:03.394 --> 51:04.595
and you pay
a straight cash bail.

51:04.729 --> 51:06.497
It's not like
Albuquerque at all.

51:11.769 --> 51:14.004
<i>Marion, you still there?</i>

51:14.139 --> 51:15.840
Yeah. Why--

51:15.973 --> 51:19.510
Why did
Jeff call you instead of me?

51:19.644 --> 51:22.513
Well, I think he was scared
at how you'd take it.

51:22.647 --> 51:24.715
Honestly, I was gonna
pay the bail myself,

51:24.849 --> 51:26.317
but I think it should be
a family member.

51:26.451 --> 51:28.419
I think that'd be best.

51:28.553 --> 51:31.055
<i>I'll tell you what, I'm gonna</i>
<i>take a shower, get dressed.</i>

51:31.189 --> 51:32.257
<i>And you do the same.</i>

51:32.390 --> 51:33.858
<i>I'll swing by and pick you up.</i>

51:33.991 --> 51:35.526
<i>We'll get this whole thing</i>
<i>squared away.</i>

51:36.761 --> 51:39.197
Wh-what about Buddy?
Is he in any trouble?

51:40.731 --> 51:42.300
<i>I don't think so.</i>

51:42.433 --> 51:43.534
<i>Why would he be?</i>

51:46.404 --> 51:48.239
<i>I'll see you in about an hour.</i>

51:48.373 --> 51:49.840
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Thanks.

Marion?

53:45.323 --> 53:47.024
- Oh!
- Hey.

53:47.157 --> 53:47.892
Hi.

53:48.025 --> 53:49.026
Oh, hey.

53:49.694 --> 53:50.728
Everything okay?

53:50.861 --> 53:52.029
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

53:52.162 --> 53:54.332
I-- I just lost track
of the time.

53:55.933 --> 53:56.901
That's okay.

53:57.034 --> 53:59.169
Uh, you wanna
put some clothes on

53:59.304 --> 54:00.538
so that we can get moving?

54:00.671 --> 54:01.672
What do you say?

54:02.773 --> 54:05.410
Uh, you know, well, I, I...

54:05.543 --> 54:06.744
I don't wanna slow things down.

54:06.877 --> 54:08.846
I think maybe
you oughta go without me.

54:08.979 --> 54:10.415
<i>...partying, minding</i>
<i>my own business.</i>

54:12.383 --> 54:14.285
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

54:14.419 --> 54:15.953
<i>I better call Saul!</i>

54:17.388 --> 54:18.856
<i>Hi. I'm Saul Goodman.</i>

54:18.989 --> 54:20.425
<i>Did you know</i>
<i>that you have rights?</i>

54:20.558 --> 54:23.328
<i>The Constitution says you do,</i>
<i>and so do I.</i>

54:23.461 --> 54:25.262
<i>I believe that,</i>
<i>until proven guilty,</i>

54:25.396 --> 54:28.433
<i>every man, woman, and child</i>
<i>in this country is innocent.</i>

54:28.566 --> 54:30.835
- <i>- And that's why I fight</i> <i>for you, Albuquerque!</i>

54:30.968 --> 54:32.903
-

54:33.037 --> 54:33.738
What's that?

54:35.172 --> 54:36.474
You tell me.

54:40.911 --> 54:42.146
Marion, do you think that's me?

54:44.382 --> 54:45.215
'Cause it's not.

54:47.785 --> 54:49.420
There never was a Nippy,
was there?

54:52.823 --> 54:54.525
What did Jeff tell you?

54:54.659 --> 54:56.126
Oh, he didn't tell me anything.

54:57.027 --> 54:58.596
Ask Jeeves told me.

55:00.998 --> 55:03.534
I typed in "con man"
and "Albuquerque,"

55:05.436 --> 55:07.938
and up you popped, big as day.

55:16.213 --> 55:17.482
What are you doing, Marion?

55:17.615 --> 55:19.149
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm calling the police.

55:20.418 --> 55:22.487
Here, lemme help you with that.

55:23.888 --> 55:24.955
Listen, I think
we're losing sight

55:25.089 --> 55:26.791
of the bigger picture
here, okay?

55:26.924 --> 55:28.926
Jeff is in trouble,
and I wanna help him.

55:29.059 --> 55:30.828
He and I sure could use
your support here.

55:30.961 --> 55:32.397
What did you get my son into?

55:32.530 --> 55:35.299
- Nothing that he didn't ask for.
-

55:35.433 --> 55:37.802
Now, listen,

55:37.935 --> 55:40.805
I'm still the good friend
you thought I was, okay?

55:40.938 --> 55:44.174
Jeff understands me,
Buddy understands me.

55:44.308 --> 55:45.843
And you will, too.

55:45.976 --> 55:48.479
It's just, you have to, uh,

55:48.613 --> 55:51.782
you know, keep things
on an even keel, all right?

55:53.884 --> 55:55.486
- What have you got there?
- Uh...

55:56.787 --> 55:57.955
- Put that down.
- Huh...

55:59.924 --> 56:00.991
Put that down, Marion.

56:02.827 --> 56:03.794
Put it down.

56:05.996 --> 56:07.164
Do not do it, Marion.

56:09.634 --> 56:10.701
Final warning.

56:22.447 --> 56:23.614
I trusted you.

56:42.500 --> 56:44.502
<i>Marion?</i>
<i>This is Valerie</i>
<i>with Life Alert.</i>

56:44.635 --> 56:45.603
<i>Are you okay?</i>

56:45.736 --> 56:48.005
No, Valerie, I'm not okay.

56:48.138 --> 56:50.340
There's a criminal standing
in my kitchen, threatening me!

56:50.475 --> 56:51.776
He's a wanted man,

56:51.909 --> 56:54.411
and his name is Saul Goodman!

56:54.545 --> 56:56.481
<i>All right, Marion,</i>
<i>I'm calling the police.</i>

56:56.614 --> 56:57.648
<i>I'm calling right now.</i>
