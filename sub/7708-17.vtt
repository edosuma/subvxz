00:02.436 --> 00:05.738
I don't know what to get your
mother for our anniversary.

00:05.740 --> 00:09.475
After 22 years of marriage,
what can I possibly get her

00:09.477 --> 00:11.377
that would really
make her happy?

00:11.379 --> 00:13.612
You could always drop
Alf off in the desert.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.483
No.

00:17.485 --> 00:21.587
Wouldn't want to waste that
on anything less than our 25th.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.023
- Ahh.
- Good morning, Alf.

00:24.025 --> 00:26.759
- Yeah, yeah.
- What's the matter?

00:26.761 --> 00:30.095
- Didn't you sleep well?
- Is it that noticeable?

00:30.097 --> 00:32.431
I tried using
Kate's cover stick

00:32.433 --> 00:35.834
but I guess, unlike her,
I was too sparing with it.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.339
Morning. Alf, um..

00:40.341 --> 00:43.375
What are these orange
hairs doing in my cover stick?

00:43.377 --> 00:45.978
Well, if they're brown at
the roots, they're yours.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.615
What is his problem?

00:49.617 --> 00:53.285
I'll tell you what my
problem is, as if you care.

00:53.287 --> 00:56.588
I missed the Melmackian
rite of passage.

00:58.225 --> 01:01.927
Does it involve a small goat
dressed in Kate's best pumps?

01:01.929 --> 01:04.830
Because that's still
out of the question.

01:04.832 --> 01:09.868
It so happens that on Melmac,
when a chap turns 233

01:09.870 --> 01:12.738
he has 6 months to become
a minister

01:12.740 --> 01:16.809
or spend the rest of
his life as an outcast.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.710
Alf, your planet exploded.

01:18.712 --> 01:22.781
How much more of an
outcast can you possibly be?

01:22.783 --> 01:24.216
Oh, you're right, Lynn.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.218
I didn't see it that way.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.686
Now let's see if you can help me

01:27.688 --> 01:31.557
with my feelings of
disloyalty to my God.

01:31.559 --> 01:34.226
- Alf, your God..
- Barry!

01:34.228 --> 01:35.994
Mwah! Mwah!

01:35.996 --> 01:38.063
Barry... understands

01:38.065 --> 01:40.599
that you're outside his
jurisdiction.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.535
Thank you, sister Kate.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.070
No, I'm afraid if
you don't help me

01:45.072 --> 01:47.172
become a minister in two weeks

01:47.174 --> 01:51.243
I'll be a lost, wandering soul
for eternity.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.911
I guess that would
affect the dynamics

01:52.913 --> 01:55.380
of the whole family
then, wouldn't it?

01:55.382 --> 01:57.616
Well, let's just say
Barry..

01:57.618 --> 01:58.784
Mwah, mwah.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.687
...help us all.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.656
[theme music]

02:31.719 --> 02:34.686
[music continues]

03:06.620 --> 03:09.054
Homina, homina,
homina, baruch, romana..

03:09.056 --> 03:11.123
[indistinct chatter]

03:11.125 --> 03:13.091
...and we all say..

03:13.093 --> 03:14.726
(all)
Amen.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.429
Second verse, same as the first.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.164
Alf.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.933
Barry.. Mwah, mwah.

03:20.935 --> 03:23.869
...says be seated.

03:23.871 --> 03:28.173
We have come together
on this solemn occasion

03:28.175 --> 03:32.444
to test whether or not
Gordon Shumway, that's me..

03:32.446 --> 03:34.846
I'm doing double duty here.

03:34.848 --> 03:38.383
...is ready to teach the
words of his holiness, Barry.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.418
Mwah, mwah.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.958
¶ Aaah Barry Barry bo ¶

03:45.960 --> 03:47.526
¶ Barry bo nana fana fo ¶

03:47.528 --> 03:50.862
¶ Barry be fine mo
Mary Mary.. ¶¶

03:50.864 --> 03:53.498
- Alf!
- Okay, let's do Alf.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.367
¶ Alf Alf bo Alf.. ¶¶

03:55.369 --> 03:56.702
This is really silly.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.971
What kinda religion is this
anyway?

03:58.973 --> 04:02.140
It's reformed.
What does it look like?

04:02.142 --> 04:04.309
Now, the congregation
will now ask me

04:04.311 --> 04:06.945
four questions from
the holy scroll.

04:06.947 --> 04:10.882
If I answer three out of the
four right, I become a minister.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.218
If I miss more than one..

04:13.220 --> 04:15.887
Well, there's
always the open bar.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.556
Brian, you're first.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.892
Question number one.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.862
"What's the kindest thing
you can do for someone else?"

04:23.864 --> 04:26.999
Burp downwind.

04:27.001 --> 04:31.236
He's right.
It says, "he who burps downwind

04:31.238 --> 04:35.040
can party with me anytime."

04:35.042 --> 04:37.409
Well, that's one right.
Three to go.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.578
- Lynn?
- Okay.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.581
[clears throat]
Question number two.

04:42.583 --> 04:46.752
"What one gesture will prove
your undying love for another?"

04:47.655 --> 04:50.756
A Mazda Miata.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.358
- Well, how could Barry..
- Ah-ah-ah-ah.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.093
Mwah, mwah.
...have known that?

04:55.095 --> 04:58.163
- They just came out last year.
- Barry knows.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.465
Actually, it says
any red convertible.

05:02.036 --> 05:03.735
He's right.

05:03.737 --> 05:07.372
Well, we've come to
the halfway point.

05:07.374 --> 05:08.373
Brian?

05:10.377 --> 05:14.546
"When does track lighting
go with Berber carpet?"

05:14.548 --> 05:17.616
Ohh. Let's see.

05:17.618 --> 05:20.285
Uh, when you stick
with stripes and solids

05:20.287 --> 05:23.288
and stay away from patterns.

05:23.290 --> 05:27.292
We worried about Barry,
but as long as he was happy.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.561
That's wrong.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.930
You're wrong, Alf.
"It's a stick with patterns

05:31.932 --> 05:34.299
"stay away from solids,
they're cold

05:34.301 --> 05:38.637
and they don't create
a welcome environment."

05:38.639 --> 05:42.240
Ugh! Religion is so subjective.

05:42.242 --> 05:43.542
This is your last chance.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.844
So take advantage of the full
20 seconds.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.448
"You've been dancing all night

05:49.450 --> 05:51.616
"and you've noticed your
partner's dress shields

05:51.618 --> 05:53.318
"have given out.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.088
"You like her, but others are
starting to point.

05:56.090 --> 05:58.490
Do you tell her?"

05:58.492 --> 05:59.624
I remember this one.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.793
The answer is "no."

06:01.795 --> 06:04.663
Instead, you dance the first
slow dance

06:04.665 --> 06:07.799
then reach in and change them
without her knowing.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.870
He's right.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.339
Congratulations,
Alf, you're a minister.

06:14.341 --> 06:17.442
You know, I'm sorry if I
implied all this was frivolous.

06:17.444 --> 06:19.311
Yes, yes!

06:19.313 --> 06:21.913
Oh, I've never won
anything before in my life!

06:21.915 --> 06:23.315
Come on, everybody.

06:23.317 --> 06:27.185
Stand and follow my lead
for a big Barry bye-bye.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.788
Mwah, mwah!
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

06:29.790 --> 06:33.158
I didn't say,
"Barry said stand."

06:33.160 --> 06:34.860
Ugh. Now we're going to have
to do this

06:34.862 --> 06:36.762
all over again.

06:36.764 --> 06:37.796
- Ohh!
- What?

06:37.798 --> 06:40.132
From the beginning.

06:40.134 --> 06:42.000
Start with the questions.
Brian?

06:44.204 --> 06:49.141
Oh, homina, homina, homina
homina, homina, homina, homina.

06:49.143 --> 06:52.477
¶ Oh-oh-oh-oh amen ¶¶

06:55.149 --> 06:56.615
Hi, Alf.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.184
How was your first
day as a minister?

06:59.186 --> 07:00.786
Well, come, my flock.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.954
It's time for me
to hear your sins

07:02.956 --> 07:06.224
and earn a couple
of bucks on the side.

07:06.226 --> 07:09.694
Oh, gee. I have the periodic
table of elements to memorize.

07:09.696 --> 07:13.465
Otherwise..
...I'd find something else.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.967
Heathenness!

07:15.969 --> 07:17.903
Brian! Wee lad!

07:17.905 --> 07:21.506
Sit on the stool!
Ease your burden of conscience

07:21.508 --> 07:23.074
and lighten your soul.

07:23.076 --> 07:26.511
There must be something
you're ashamed of.

07:26.513 --> 07:29.181
Sorry. No, there isn't.

07:29.183 --> 07:31.383
Oh, come on.
Of course there is.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.218
I know guilt when I see it.

07:33.220 --> 07:38.590
Now, sit down, fork
over two bucks, and dish.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.759
All I've got is a quarter.

07:40.761 --> 07:44.095
You're in luck.
It's happy hour.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.765
Now, I want you to confess
the things you've done

07:46.767 --> 07:49.701
that you don't want
anyone to know about.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.471
But if I tell you, you'll know.

07:52.473 --> 07:55.907
Then I'll close the shutters,
and I won't know who you are.

07:55.909 --> 07:59.344
But you already know who I am.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.680
Take your quarter.
Go to your room.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.282
- Get out of here.
- Thanks. This was fun.

08:06.386 --> 08:09.054
There but for the grace
of Barry..

08:09.056 --> 08:10.288
Mwah, mwah.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.323
...go I.

08:15.229 --> 08:17.162
Kate! Say yay-ah!

08:18.131 --> 08:19.631
- Hi, Alf.
- Ahh!

08:19.633 --> 08:21.733
Barry is speakin'
through me now.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.302
I feel good,
just like I knew I would.

08:24.304 --> 08:27.339
I feel fine.
It must be divine.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.407
Walk to me, Kate. Walk to me.

08:29.409 --> 08:32.010
Show me you can walk.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.713
I'll show you something else in
a minute if you don't stop it.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.815
Ahh, aggression.

08:36.817 --> 08:40.619
What has made this tired,
haggard woman so bitter?

08:40.621 --> 08:42.420
What a life she must have had.

08:42.422 --> 08:45.757
Everybody,
everybody, please stand.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.592
Pray for her.

08:47.594 --> 08:49.928
¶ Amazing grace ¶

08:49.930 --> 08:52.998
¶ How sweet thou art ¶

08:53.000 --> 08:56.668
¶ To save a wretch like Kate ¶¶

08:56.670 --> 08:58.336
Shut up!

08:58.338 --> 09:00.338
Oh! I forgive you.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.840
See how easy that was?

09:01.842 --> 09:04.342
Now, come on, Kate.
It's only two bucks.

09:06.346 --> 09:10.649
I would rather confess
my sins to Jimmy Swaggart.

09:10.651 --> 09:13.385
You'd have to go to a
cheap motel for that!

09:15.489 --> 09:16.655
[sighs]

09:16.657 --> 09:18.223
This family's gonna burn.

09:25.899 --> 09:31.303
Uh-oh. I hear the pitter-patter
of pious paws.

09:31.305 --> 09:33.672
I bet you can't say
that six times fast.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.374
[knocking on door]

09:36.376 --> 09:40.011
(Alf)
'Are you being
fruitful and multiplying?'

09:40.013 --> 09:43.114
- None of your business.
- 'Oh, good.'

09:43.116 --> 09:44.316
(Alf)
'Then I can come in.'

09:44.318 --> 09:46.151
[door opens]

09:46.153 --> 09:47.819
Don't mind if I do.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.120
You're too kind.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.158
Say, did it ever occur to you

09:53.160 --> 09:55.727
that we might just
want our privacy?

09:55.729 --> 09:57.562
Well, you always
say to ask first

09:57.564 --> 10:00.031
ever since that one time.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.334
That was pretty
embarrassing for you.

10:02.336 --> 10:04.569
I know it was for me.

10:04.571 --> 10:07.706
- What do you want?
- I've got a problem.

10:07.708 --> 10:11.309
I'm in terrible danger
of losing my ministry.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.080
And the problem?

10:15.082 --> 10:18.149
Oh, hardy har har.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.353
Men of peace are always
objects of ridicule.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.221
Read this and weep.

10:26.526 --> 10:29.594
"Can you find Barry
in this picture?"

10:29.596 --> 10:32.497
No! I'm talking about
the paragraph under the

10:32.499 --> 10:36.501
"can you help Barry
get out of the maze?"

10:36.503 --> 10:40.005
"If the newly ordained minister
does not perform a good deed

10:40.007 --> 10:43.742
"by officiating at a hallowed
ceremony within ten working days

10:43.744 --> 10:48.980
"thereby proving his worth
as a man of the cloth, the..

10:48.982 --> 10:51.349
"...the penance shall be dire

10:51.351 --> 10:55.253
and catastrophic to all those
concerned."

10:55.255 --> 10:57.055
There he is.
There's Barry right there.

10:57.057 --> 11:00.025
Right by the big clock.
You see? You see his face?

11:00.027 --> 11:01.393
- Look.
- Willie.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.428
- Hmm?
- Honey, focus.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.598
We may be in big trouble.
I need you with me.

11:06.600 --> 11:10.635
There go all my dreams,
my hopes.

11:10.637 --> 11:14.773
My plans for building
a religious theme park.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.941
Look, can we get back to that
"dire penance" thing?

11:16.943 --> 11:19.177
Just exactly how dire
are we talking?

11:20.213 --> 11:21.913
[yodeling]

11:21.915 --> 11:22.914
Stop it!

11:24.484 --> 11:26.785
Alright?
I know it's fun now.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.586
Just wait 20 years.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.889
Because after midnight tonight

11:30.891 --> 11:33.491
I'll be bound by all that's holy

11:33.493 --> 11:35.894
to yodel for the
rest of my life.

11:41.835 --> 11:45.270
Honey, I'm afraid.

11:45.272 --> 11:48.239
Sweetie, we're all afraid

11:48.241 --> 11:50.942
but luckily, I have a plan.

11:50.944 --> 11:54.345
Now, call me crazy,
but what if, say

11:54.347 --> 11:58.550
I were to officiate at a renewal
of your wedding vows?

12:00.821 --> 12:01.853
Not in my lifetime.

12:03.423 --> 12:07.292
Alf, you're millions and
millions of miles away.

12:07.294 --> 12:11.463
Do you think Barry will really
know if you don't yodel?

12:11.465 --> 12:14.499
This planet's on the side
of his good ear.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.134
He'll know.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.837
So think about it.
Let me know in the morning.

12:21.808 --> 12:24.175
He's really got us by
the lederhosen, hasn't he?

12:25.846 --> 12:27.078
Speak for yourself.

12:28.281 --> 12:31.249
[Alf yodeling]

12:38.725 --> 12:41.693
[Alf yodeling]

12:46.133 --> 12:51.836
I like yodeling as much as the
next guy, but I have my limits.

12:51.838 --> 12:53.872
I know, Bri.
Your mother and I

12:53.874 --> 12:56.040
have had plenty of time
to discuss this matter.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.610
We just seem to be of
somewhat different opinions.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.678
It's just that I think
this maybe another trick of Alf

13:00.680 --> 13:03.281
just to get us to do
what he wants us to do.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.484
Oh, I say, who cares?
Let's just do it.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.353
Mom, I know you're
really against it

13:08.355 --> 13:10.355
but I think the idea's romantic.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.323
And you were wondering
what to do for your anniversary.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.425
I just don't know
what it would do to the sanctity

13:14.427 --> 13:16.261
of our marriage
to be joined by a minister

13:16.263 --> 13:20.932
who sucks cranberry juice
through his nose.

13:20.934 --> 13:24.669
Still, he seems sincere,
and he did get Bar..

13:24.671 --> 13:28.973
Mwah, mwah.
Barry out of the maze.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.075
[coughing]

13:31.077 --> 13:34.779
Could I have some hot tea
with lemon, please?

13:35.415 --> 13:37.549
[yodeling]

13:37.551 --> 13:39.584
[coughing]

13:41.121 --> 13:46.758
Only 400 more years of this,
then I get to die.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.326
Look at him, Kate.

13:48.328 --> 13:52.931
He's a drooling,
sniveling, pathetic mess.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.867
Oh, that's it, Willie.
Really sell it.

13:55.869 --> 13:58.236
[yodeling]

13:58.238 --> 14:00.205
[coughing]

14:01.174 --> 14:02.240
Don't let me..

14:02.242 --> 14:03.274
[yodeling]

14:03.276 --> 14:05.210
[coughing]

14:05.212 --> 14:08.546
...influence you.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.481
How about it, Kate?

14:10.483 --> 14:11.916
You wanna get married?

14:11.918 --> 14:13.551
Would it mean
he'd stop yodeling?

14:16.656 --> 14:18.556
I would love to marry you,
honey.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.292
And I don't feel
manipulated at all.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.493
[coughing]

14:22.495 --> 14:24.495
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.364
Now, if you'll excuse me

14:26.366 --> 14:30.301
I'm gonna try to find a cough
drop the size of Dom Deluise.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.336
[coughing]

14:33.139 --> 14:36.040
'Oops. Watch your step.
I'll get that later.'

14:44.951 --> 14:46.551
Do you think if I tried yodeling

14:46.553 --> 14:48.653
I could get a new Nintendo game?

14:48.655 --> 14:51.289
No, but it might get you
a new set of teeth.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.658
Come on.
The first one's free.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.194
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm overly anxious

14:56.196 --> 14:57.929
that everything goes smoothly.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.330
Do you have the ring?

14:59.332 --> 15:03.434
No, I sold for three
magic beans.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.838
- Brian, go get your father.
- Why, what's wrong?

15:06.840 --> 15:10.141
Nothing. And whatever you do,
tell him not to panic.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.377
Oh, my God!
What-what's happened?

15:12.379 --> 15:14.245
No to worry.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.481
But I was just using my
Barry-decoder ring

15:16.483 --> 15:19.050
to figure out this last puzzle.

15:19.052 --> 15:23.021
And I thought I should alert you
to a potential problem.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.056
You look really sharp,
by the way.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.458
Alf, what's the problem?

15:27.460 --> 15:30.061
Well, it's just that
if you and Kate

15:30.063 --> 15:33.264
aren't truly moved by my
ceremony

15:33.266 --> 15:36.200
just call me Heidi,
the lonely goatherd.

15:37.938 --> 15:41.139
- What a wondrous religion.
- Isn't it?

15:41.141 --> 15:43.107
It's for ages three and up.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.412
Well? How do I look?

15:47.414 --> 15:49.447
Mom, you look beautiful.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.815
You look neat.

15:50.817 --> 15:53.051
My bride.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.452
I think I'll keep her.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.256
Kate, white?

15:58.258 --> 16:00.658
I mean, you're at
least three kids past white.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.397
Or, white.
White's just as good.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.400
[doorbell ringing]

16:09.402 --> 16:10.668
Good timing.

16:13.773 --> 16:17.108
- It's Mrs. Ochmonek.
- Oh, great. Alf..

16:17.110 --> 16:20.912
Okay, okay.
What would Jim Bakker do?

16:20.914 --> 16:24.148
I know. I'll be on the floor
in a fetal position.

16:28.488 --> 16:32.223
- Oh, hi, Raquel.
- Hello. Oh, my. Look at you.

16:32.225 --> 16:36.127
Um, I saw all those lovely
flowers being delivered

16:36.129 --> 16:38.763
and I thought
somebody might be sick.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.165
It's, uh..

16:41.167 --> 16:42.834
Um..

16:42.836 --> 16:44.369
It's Brian's turtle.

16:47.640 --> 16:51.676
- Oh, no! Gabby.
- Oh, for heaven's sake.

16:51.678 --> 16:55.046
- You don't even have a turtle.
- Then who's Gabby?

16:55.048 --> 16:56.047
Later.

16:58.618 --> 17:04.122
Yes, uh, Brian's turtle Gabby
passed away last night.

17:04.124 --> 17:07.358
And we were just about to have
a memorial service for him.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.061
Oh, I see.

17:10.063 --> 17:13.264
And was that Gabby's
favorite dress?

17:13.266 --> 17:15.900
Uh, yes, as a matter
of fact, it was.

17:15.902 --> 17:18.069
He was a very complex turtle.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.772
I guess.

17:20.774 --> 17:22.540
Well, if there's
anything I can do..

17:22.542 --> 17:24.308
You mean, in lieu of flowers?

17:24.310 --> 17:26.110
Look, this sounds crazy, I know

17:26.112 --> 17:29.180
but you could send a check
to the New York City Ballet.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.851
He was quite a patron
of the arts.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.189
If you want me to leave,
why don't you just say so?

17:38.191 --> 17:40.491
In fact, don't even say so.
I'll leave on my own.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.660
I think that would be best.
I-I'm sorry, Raquel.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.562
We're, we're not ourselves.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.733
I think we handled that
pretty well.

17:50.703 --> 17:53.638
Well, I expect to see you
in confession tomorrow.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.742
- Bring your checkbook.
- Alf, please. Let's..

17:57.744 --> 18:00.211
Let's just get this over with.

18:00.213 --> 18:04.082
Uh-oh. It's Heidi time.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.716
Ah, what does he mean by that?

18:05.718 --> 18:09.887
Oh, I think what Alf is trying
to say is that

18:09.889 --> 18:12.757
this is an expression
of our love.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.760
Uh, I can't think of any better
way to spend our anniversary

18:15.762 --> 18:19.497
than to, to confirm our vows
all over again.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.999
Well, how do you say that
with a straight face?

18:24.704 --> 18:26.204
Is everybody ready?

18:26.206 --> 18:27.238
Lynn?

18:28.508 --> 18:29.540
[button clicks]

18:29.542 --> 18:32.076
[instrumental music]

18:32.078 --> 18:33.978
[Alf clears throat]

18:33.980 --> 18:35.313
Ah..

18:35.315 --> 18:39.016
We are gathered here
to witness the rejoining

18:39.018 --> 18:42.353
of these two pretty
wonderful kids.

18:42.355 --> 18:45.456
Two people who are
more in love today

18:45.458 --> 18:49.227
than they were when
they first met 22 years ago.

18:49.229 --> 18:52.230
Pretty touching, huh?

18:52.232 --> 18:53.464
Willie, you're on.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.267
Kate..

18:57.504 --> 19:00.638
I take you for my wife.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.074
To support and care for you

19:03.076 --> 19:05.710
to love you and cherish you

19:05.712 --> 19:09.213
as I have since the
first day we ever met.

19:09.215 --> 19:13.151
You've given me three
beautiful children.

19:13.153 --> 19:17.889
And you've filled my life
with joy and with love.

19:17.891 --> 19:21.592
May our lives together be long
and happy.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.732
Willie..

19:27.734 --> 19:29.467
[chuckles]

19:29.469 --> 19:32.970
I, I take you to be my husband,

19:32.972 --> 19:37.975
to, to care for you and,
and to support you.

19:37.977 --> 19:41.913
To share your joy
and your sorrow.

19:41.915 --> 19:43.981
You're my rock.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.751
You're my strength.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.286
And I'll love you forever.

19:52.759 --> 19:56.961
- Congratulations, mom and dad.
- Alright!

19:56.963 --> 20:00.331
Hey, wait a second!
It's not over yet.

20:00.333 --> 20:04.769
What do you mean?
Kate and I were both very moved.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.905
Now we're back to being
a yodel-free household.

20:07.907 --> 20:11.275
Yeah, but it wasn't
because of anything I said.

20:11.277 --> 20:12.877
Now, the rules specifically
state--

20:12.879 --> 20:16.347
Look, Alf, being a minister
doesn't depend on

20:16.349 --> 20:19.450
just blindly following
what's written in a book.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.486
It's how you live.
It's teachings.

20:22.488 --> 20:25.923
You did something
wonderful here

20:25.925 --> 20:29.026
and we were moved.

20:29.028 --> 20:33.497
Now I'm left feeling
empty and void and hollow.

20:33.499 --> 20:37.134
Well, Alf, what was it
you would have said?

20:37.136 --> 20:41.005
Well, I probably would
have opened with a joke.

20:41.007 --> 20:44.275
See, you know, something
to loosen the crowd.

20:44.277 --> 20:47.612
Then I probably would
have gone on to say

20:47.614 --> 20:51.215
how hard it is to
express true feelings.

20:51.217 --> 20:54.852
Because it's hard to tell
somebody how much you love them.

20:54.854 --> 20:58.623
And when I see the
ease with which you two

20:58.625 --> 21:02.026
declare your love over and over

21:02.028 --> 21:04.395
well, I know that
nothing can ever

21:04.397 --> 21:07.665
come along to destroy it.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.667
Now I'll never get a chance
to say that.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.157
Bummer.

21:16.158 --> 21:17.808
Just when I thought
you couldn't surprise me.

21:17.810 --> 21:21.178
Oh! Ha-ha! A tear!
Hey, you saw it!

21:21.180 --> 21:24.348
You all saw it!
I've got witnesses.

21:24.350 --> 21:25.783
I think that Barry..

21:25.785 --> 21:27.151
Mwah, mwah.

21:27.153 --> 21:30.254
...if he's listening,
with his good ear

21:30.256 --> 21:31.522
is very proud of you.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.691
Ha! Ha! Thank you!

21:33.693 --> 21:35.726
Hey, now I'd like
to say a few words

21:35.728 --> 21:39.030
about a brave young
turtle named Gabby.

21:39.032 --> 21:42.266
For a turtle,
he was kind of slow

21:42.268 --> 21:44.468
but we loved him nonetheless.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.638
He was a dear pet, a nice pet.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.173
A non-existent pet.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.850
- Morning, Alf.
- Morning.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.086
You're not wearing your robes.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.622
Well, now that I've
completed my training

22:04.624 --> 22:07.124
I only have to serve
one weekend a month

22:07.126 --> 22:09.627
plus two weeks
during the summer

22:09.629 --> 22:13.230
unless there's a
national emergency.

22:13.232 --> 22:16.734
Well, I gotta give you credit,
Alf. It was..

22:16.736 --> 22:19.904
...it was a very sweet ceremony.

22:19.906 --> 22:22.273
Well, thanks, Kate.

22:22.275 --> 22:24.975
So, uh, how was the
old wedding night?

22:24.977 --> 22:27.645
Hubba hubba, ding ding!

22:27.647 --> 22:30.481
How the mighty have fallen.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.283
That good, huh?

22:32.285 --> 22:34.885
And while you're
still in a giving mood

22:34.887 --> 22:36.787
isn't it customary to
tip the one

22:36.789 --> 22:39.290
who performs the ceremony?

22:39.292 --> 22:41.092
Don't you think it's payment
enough to know

22:41.094 --> 22:42.927
that you've done
something admirable

22:42.929 --> 22:45.896
for your fellow bipeds?

22:45.898 --> 22:48.833
Look, I'll give you a receipt
for twice the amount

22:48.835 --> 22:51.335
and you could write
it off on your taxes.

22:51.337 --> 22:53.070
What's the big deal?

22:53.072 --> 22:54.405
I'll tell you what, Alf.

22:54.407 --> 22:57.908
How about a German
chocolate cake?

22:57.910 --> 23:00.478
Really? Sold!

23:00.480 --> 23:05.783
As Barry is my witness,
I'll never go hungry again.

23:05.785 --> 23:08.285
Ah, ha!

23:08.287 --> 23:11.255
[theme music]

23:12.291 --> 23:15.259
[music continues]

23:40.553 --> 23:41.886
Yodelayheehoo!
