WEBVTT

00:03.597 --> 00:05.317
I hurt myself.

00:06.316 --> 00:06.955
Hello?

00:06.955 --> 00:08.915
All right, fine. Bye.

00:08.916 --> 00:12.916
I need to go. We'll talk about this
when I get back, I promise.

00:14.076 --> 00:16.155
Will you stop staring at me?
It freaks me out.

00:16.157 --> 00:17.915
I'm not staring at you.

00:17.916 --> 00:20.475
You absolute scrubber.

00:20.476 --> 00:23.874
You apologise to her now
or I will curl you up, all right?

00:23.875 --> 00:25.194
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

00:25.195 --> 00:27.476
How could I have got him so wrong?

00:27.477 --> 00:29.995
Y'all right?

00:36.676 --> 00:38.395
Dear diary.

00:38.396 --> 00:42.396
Lust has taken over. No matter
what else is going on in my life,

00:43.476 --> 00:47.276
there's only one thing allowed
inside my head right now.

00:47.277 --> 00:50.435
And his name is Finn.

00:50.436 --> 00:53.355
And that's because I kissed him.

00:53.356 --> 00:56.315
Well, technically kissed him.

00:56.316 --> 00:58.955
Let me explain.

00:58.956 --> 01:02.075
As you know, I kissed Archie.

01:02.076 --> 01:06.076
This is before I knew he was gay,
so it still counts.

01:06.596 --> 01:09.675
Archie kissed a girl...

01:09.676 --> 01:12.755
reluctantly, called Tracey Croft.

01:12.756 --> 01:16.756
Tracey Croft shared a bit of her
kebab, and tongue, with Chop.

01:18.116 --> 01:20.635
Bleurgh!

01:20.636 --> 01:24.636
Chop unknowingly kissed Izzy
up near Rutland Waters.

01:25.156 --> 01:28.234
Whoever that was, can't kiss.
It's like kissing a bloody corpse.

01:28.235 --> 01:32.236
Izzy swapped lips minutes later
with a girl called Julia Fisher.

01:33.596 --> 01:36.555
That's how you kiss someone.
Oo-ooh!

01:36.556 --> 01:40.556
And finally, Julia Fisher kissed...

01:42.036 --> 01:46.036
my Finn.

01:46.356 --> 01:50.356
So there,
technically we've sort of kissed.

01:50.756 --> 01:51.875
Simple.

01:51.876 --> 01:54.555
Maybe you're in love.
I'm not in love!

01:54.556 --> 01:57.634
How many men do I fancy per week?
Well, this sounds different.

01:57.635 --> 02:00.076
It's not different
and I'm not in love.

02:00.077 --> 02:01.635
I don't even know him.

02:01.636 --> 02:04.714
I used to think he was shallow,
and maybe he is.

02:04.715 --> 02:08.716
Maybe I'm just confused because
I want him to tickle my kidneys.

02:08.876 --> 02:10.435
What's he like?

02:10.436 --> 02:13.594
Well, he's got this shy, but would-be
nuclear-in-bed thing going on.

02:13.595 --> 02:14.796
He really likes music and...

02:14.797 --> 02:18.796
Oh, bollocks! Hide!

02:18.876 --> 02:22.876
What the hell is he doing here?

02:25.236 --> 02:28.315
I thought you said he was shallow.

02:28.316 --> 02:31.715
I think I might be about
to commit a sex crime.

02:31.716 --> 02:35.155
I think I might be your accomplice.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.595
Bollocks!

02:36.596 --> 02:39.116
I'm in love, aren't I?

03:17.516 --> 03:19.835
Rae, it's Chloe... again.

03:19.836 --> 03:21.955
Look, we should meet up.

03:21.956 --> 03:24.756
We've got loads to chat about,
so please call me back.

03:37.276 --> 03:39.995
That's it.

03:39.996 --> 03:41.915
What the hell is going on?

03:41.916 --> 03:44.756
We've installed a chin-up bar
in your doorway.

03:44.757 --> 03:46.235
Why?

03:46.236 --> 03:49.036
Karim says it's the strongest
doorway in the house.

03:49.037 --> 03:51.515
You can't do that.

03:51.516 --> 03:53.634
Rae, he can't leave the house,
remember.

03:53.635 --> 03:57.636
He's got to stay in shape
if he wants to keep me interested.

03:57.676 --> 03:59.714
There's no point arguing with you,
is there?

03:59.715 --> 04:03.234
No, not really, not unless
you want to pay the mortgage.

04:03.235 --> 04:07.236
Dear diary, it's been over a decade
since a man's lived in this house

04:07.756 --> 04:11.756
and now I have a six-foot tall
Tunisian sweating in my doorway.

04:11.876 --> 04:14.716
I give it two weeks
before Mum scares him off.

04:14.717 --> 04:18.716
This came for you.

04:20.476 --> 04:22.075
Just look at my dad.

04:22.076 --> 04:25.156
My mum is so annoying
that when they split up,

04:25.157 --> 04:27.395
he moved to the Outer Hebrides.

04:27.396 --> 04:30.674
He's sent a couple of postcards
a year since I was six.

04:30.675 --> 04:32.876
He never leaves a return address.

04:32.877 --> 04:36.395
He says he doesn't want
to stand on my mum's toes.

04:36.396 --> 04:37.715
Dear Rae...

04:37.716 --> 04:40.476
I always imagine him
to have a Scottish accent.

04:40.477 --> 04:42.515
I'm not sure why.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.595
I think he was born in Derby.

04:44.596 --> 04:48.556
Just wanted to drop you a card
to say that I'm thinking of you.

04:48.557 --> 04:52.515
Stay out of trouble.
Lots of love, Victor.

04:52.516 --> 04:53.635
Dad.

04:53.636 --> 04:57.235
He always finishes
with a piece of life advice.

04:57.236 --> 05:01.236
PS, he who is dishonest
only ever lies to himself.

05:01.556 --> 05:05.556
The truthful path is the only one
that leads to happiness.

05:06.556 --> 05:10.556
Rae.

05:13.436 --> 05:15.995
What does that look mean?

05:15.996 --> 05:17.554
You mean you don't know.

05:17.555 --> 05:20.996
I thought you knew what was going on
in my head at every moment.

05:20.997 --> 05:24.996
Well, maybe I do
and I want you to tell me.

05:26.196 --> 05:29.195
I'm just...

05:29.196 --> 05:31.355
tired of being a phoney.

05:31.356 --> 05:33.556
I feel like I've been carrying around

05:33.557 --> 05:37.315
this big backpack of bullshit
for months.

05:37.316 --> 05:41.316
It's exhausting, you know?

05:42.036 --> 05:45.036
When I told Chloe I'd been ill,
I felt nervous.

05:45.037 --> 05:48.835
And then angry
because she walked out.

05:48.836 --> 05:51.795
But afterwards...

05:51.796 --> 05:55.596
I felt like I'd put down
the big bag of bullshit for a while.

05:55.597 --> 05:59.596
Relief. Right, relief.

06:00.596 --> 06:02.515
I want to be like...

06:02.516 --> 06:04.355
a new Rae.

06:04.356 --> 06:07.115
No more backpack. Exactly.

06:07.116 --> 06:09.636
And I want us
to be able to talk about anything.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.915
Be really honest with each other.
I mean...

06:12.916 --> 06:14.875
why not?

06:14.876 --> 06:18.156
I'm loving the new Rae.
So what do you want to talk about?

06:18.157 --> 06:20.235
First of all...

06:20.236 --> 06:22.795
I think I'm in love.

06:22.796 --> 06:25.236
Oh, oh. What happened?
I don't know.

06:25.237 --> 06:27.515
I feel... sick.

06:27.516 --> 06:28.914
I feel like I'm floating,

06:28.915 --> 06:32.754
like a warm breeze could just blow me
off the face of the earth.

06:32.755 --> 06:34.836
Oh, yes, sounds like love to me.
So?

06:34.837 --> 06:36.555
What do I do?

06:36.556 --> 06:39.636
Well, what would the new Rae do?

06:44.716 --> 06:48.716
New Rae needed a manifesto
of honesty.

06:49.516 --> 06:52.236
Tell Finn I kind of, sort of,
love him.

06:52.237 --> 06:54.795
Tell Chloe everything that happened.

06:54.796 --> 06:58.796
Tell everyone I was ill.

07:04.156 --> 07:05.355
This is crazy.

07:05.356 --> 07:07.835
He's like looking at porn.

07:07.836 --> 07:10.955
As if he's ever going to like me.

07:10.956 --> 07:14.956
Rae!

07:16.316 --> 07:17.676
What are you doing here?

07:17.677 --> 07:19.795
I just came for a walk.

07:19.796 --> 07:22.156
Just keeping it real,
keeping it busy.

07:22.157 --> 07:25.635
Real busy.

07:25.636 --> 07:29.035
So how was Knebworth, then?

07:29.036 --> 07:30.755
Crap. Liar.

07:30.756 --> 07:34.756
I were gutted you couldn't come.

07:36.836 --> 07:39.034
Finn...
I wanted to tell you something.

07:39.035 --> 07:40.794
I wanted to talk to you too,
actually.

07:40.795 --> 07:44.076
Look, I'm sorry I was a bit
of a dick when we first met.

07:44.077 --> 07:45.595
I just...

07:45.596 --> 07:47.116
I got you wrong, I guess.

07:47.117 --> 07:49.195
I didn't know you were sound.

07:49.196 --> 07:50.635
Finn!

07:50.636 --> 07:54.636
Anyway, look, I'd better go.

08:06.516 --> 08:09.635
Oh... my... Lord!

08:09.636 --> 08:13.636
I'm never using this hand again
for anything.

08:14.396 --> 08:15.755
Well...

08:15.756 --> 08:19.756
maybe for one thing.

08:39.635 --> 08:42.115
Rae, thank God, look, don't panic.

08:42.116 --> 08:43.234
Nobody is panicking,

08:43.235 --> 08:45.756
but me and Karim, we've got to
leave the country.

08:45.757 --> 08:46.835
What?

08:46.836 --> 08:49.036
We think someone's tipped off
Immigration.

08:49.037 --> 08:50.395
Who?

08:50.396 --> 08:52.515
Fucking Sally Crowther's mum.

08:52.516 --> 08:55.474
Tess, who works behind the Lottery
counter at Food Giant, right,

08:55.475 --> 08:58.394
says she's been asking questions
about the exotic man who lives here.

08:58.395 --> 09:01.876
What exactly do you mean,
you're leaving the country?

09:01.877 --> 09:03.275
I'm buggering off.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.555
Outside of England, to Tunisia.

09:05.556 --> 09:07.515
This is crazy.

09:07.516 --> 09:09.674
No, it's all right,
it's only for three nights.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.674
It's not like we're going on
holiday.

09:11.675 --> 09:13.116
Oh, Karim, make sure you
bring the camera.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.515
Camera.

09:14.516 --> 09:16.875
Right.

09:16.876 --> 09:18.274
I'm really not happy
about leaving you.

09:18.275 --> 09:19.636
Are you sure you're
going to be right?

09:19.637 --> 09:21.515
I'll be fine.

09:21.516 --> 09:24.516
Maybe I shouldn't go. Cos last time
you were on your own...

09:24.517 --> 09:28.516
It's not like last time.
I'm much better than I was.

09:31.396 --> 09:32.916
Mum, you're scaring me.

09:32.917 --> 09:34.595
Taxi man. Taxi man.

09:34.596 --> 09:36.076
Right... out of the way.

09:36.077 --> 09:38.195
No parties.

09:38.196 --> 09:40.634
I've asked Mrs Dewhurst to keep an
eye on you

09:40.635 --> 09:42.234
and I'm going to ring Kester

09:42.235 --> 09:46.194
to make sure he can bring forward
your second appointment. No parties.

09:46.195 --> 09:48.594
I've left a list of things
by the kettle.

09:48.595 --> 09:51.276
Go to the hospital
if you don't feel well.

09:51.277 --> 09:55.276
Bye, love.

09:56.676 --> 10:00.676
No parties.

10:04.236 --> 10:07.474
What should you do when the bane of
your existence

10:07.475 --> 10:09.436
finally pisses off for a bit?

10:22.676 --> 10:26.676
Hmm... maybe I'll just start with
a movie and some ice-cream.

10:51.392 --> 10:52.672
How long's she away for?

10:52.673 --> 10:56.672
She's back on Thursday.

10:57.431 --> 10:58.470
What's that?

10:58.471 --> 11:02.471
It's a present... to say sorry.

11:03.391 --> 11:07.351
I was a mess when you came round to
mine.

11:10.231 --> 11:14.231
Well, I was a twat. Really.

11:15.991 --> 11:19.991
Here.

11:22.191 --> 11:23.750
So...

11:23.751 --> 11:25.830
what happened with Stephen?

11:25.831 --> 11:28.511
Well, we dragged it out
for another three hours...

11:28.512 --> 11:30.990
is what happened.

11:30.991 --> 11:34.550
But I don't want to talk about that.

11:34.551 --> 11:36.070
So...

11:36.071 --> 11:37.350
So...

11:37.351 --> 11:40.669
I guess I never finished telling you
what happened to me.

11:40.670 --> 11:43.831
Well, you don't have to tell me
if you don't want to, it's fine.

11:43.832 --> 11:47.831
No, I want to.

11:52.191 --> 11:55.590
You said you hate yourself.

11:55.591 --> 11:59.591
I just, um...

12:06.511 --> 12:09.190
It was March.

12:09.191 --> 12:13.191
My mum was on nights.

12:13.991 --> 12:17.150
I'd be at school in the day,
I'd come back,

12:17.151 --> 12:19.429
my tea would be in the oven
with a note.

12:19.430 --> 12:21.709
I didn't see her for three or four
days.

12:21.710 --> 12:24.711
It was too quiet.
Time to think about things.

12:24.712 --> 12:28.711
My mind started screaming.

12:28.951 --> 12:31.110
Getting into weird patterns.

12:31.111 --> 12:33.030
Weird repetitions.

12:33.031 --> 12:34.950
Random bad thoughts.

12:34.951 --> 12:38.230
Something broke inside me.

12:38.231 --> 12:41.989
And the weight of one thing just
pulled everything else apart...

12:41.990 --> 12:45.071
everything else apart.
Pulled everything else apart.

12:51.711 --> 12:53.070
Rae...

12:53.071 --> 12:55.830
why did you do that?

12:55.831 --> 12:57.190
I don't know.

12:57.191 --> 12:59.471
Something must have made you do it.

12:59.472 --> 13:03.471
What were you thinking about?

13:10.871 --> 13:12.510
I don't know.

13:12.511 --> 13:16.511
I think sometimes people just go
crazy.

13:17.151 --> 13:18.950
But it doesn't matter.

13:18.951 --> 13:22.951
I'm not like that any more.

13:23.391 --> 13:25.790
I'm getting better.

13:25.791 --> 13:29.030
Are you sure?

13:29.031 --> 13:31.070
Yeah.

13:31.071 --> 13:35.071
Yeah, I am.

13:56.191 --> 13:58.911
I've decided I'm going to tell
everyone.

13:58.912 --> 14:02.830
Why?

14:02.831 --> 14:04.469
I just feel like a phoney.

14:04.470 --> 14:06.031
I'm tired of having secrets.

14:06.032 --> 14:08.510
Rae, everyone's got secrets.

14:08.511 --> 14:11.390
I need to do this.

14:11.391 --> 14:12.430
For me.

14:12.431 --> 14:16.431
OK.

14:24.951 --> 14:28.590
One down, two to go.

14:28.591 --> 14:31.230
Bollocks to a saliva tree.

14:31.231 --> 14:35.231
I needed to give him
some of my real saliva.

14:35.471 --> 14:39.471
On whichever part of his body
he wanted.

14:40.111 --> 14:43.430
And if being honest
might make this happen,

14:43.431 --> 14:47.431
it was time to truth the fuck up.

14:54.831 --> 14:57.470
Anyway, then he hugged me.

14:57.471 --> 14:59.550
Shirtless?
Oh!

14:59.551 --> 15:01.950
He smelt of boy sweat and CK One.

15:01.951 --> 15:04.229
I thought my ovaries
were going to explode.

15:04.230 --> 15:06.269
So, are you still going to tell him
you like him?

15:06.270 --> 15:08.031
You're heading towards
the friend zone.

15:08.032 --> 15:12.031
What? You're heading towards
the friend zone.

15:12.951 --> 15:14.751
What the hell are you talking about?

15:14.752 --> 15:18.751
So this is basically the zone
where Finn's friends live.

15:18.951 --> 15:22.951
And this is the zone where Finn's
romantic possibilities live.

15:24.631 --> 15:28.470
And this...

15:28.471 --> 15:29.950
is you, Rae.

15:29.951 --> 15:32.269
Now, you're getting to know the guy
and you're gonna end up

15:32.270 --> 15:33.549
in one of these two areas.

15:33.550 --> 15:35.989
Now, tell me, which area do you want
to end up in?

15:35.990 --> 15:38.629
Tix? She wants to be in
the romantic zone.

15:38.630 --> 15:41.429
Correct, Tix, she wants to be
in the romantic zone.

15:41.430 --> 15:44.231
But at the moment, Rae,
you are heading over here.

15:44.232 --> 15:46.550
But we hugged.

15:46.551 --> 15:50.071
Exactly. Now, that's exactly my
point. Now, who do you ever hug, hm?

15:50.072 --> 15:52.710
Your gran, your mum, your mates.

15:52.711 --> 15:56.191
AKA, people you have
no romantic interest in whatsoever.

15:56.192 --> 15:58.030
So, go on then.

15:58.031 --> 16:01.430
How do I make it to
the romantic zone?

16:01.431 --> 16:05.431
Well, first off, as a general rule,
no hugging.

16:05.511 --> 16:09.270
OK? No... hugging.

16:09.271 --> 16:12.031
Then all you have to do
is act like you don't like him.

16:12.032 --> 16:14.870
Treat him mean to keep him keen.

16:14.871 --> 16:18.871
What, am I 11 years old or something?
It'll create tension,

16:18.991 --> 16:22.670
and tension... tension is the key

16:22.671 --> 16:24.470
to getting here.

16:24.471 --> 16:26.669
Why can't I just be honest with him?

16:26.670 --> 16:28.269
Look, take it or leave it.

16:28.270 --> 16:31.511
Danny knows what he's talking about.
Thanks, Dix.

16:31.512 --> 16:35.511
See me after class for some
extra-curricular shenanigans.

16:36.551 --> 16:38.511
Tix, do you fancy him?

16:46.431 --> 16:47.630
Chloe?

16:47.631 --> 16:50.829
Have you ever heard of the friend
zone? Heard of it?

16:50.830 --> 16:52.749
You're looking at it right now.

16:52.750 --> 16:56.751
Do you think they like each other?
Izzy definitely likes Chop.

16:57.271 --> 17:00.469
I reckon Chop likes Izzy,
I just don't think he knows it yet.

17:00.470 --> 17:02.471
Do you think they'll ever go out
with each other?

17:02.472 --> 17:03.710
I doubt it.

17:03.711 --> 17:07.711
There's no way out of the
friend zone, Rae.

17:10.991 --> 17:13.230
All right?

17:13.231 --> 17:16.670
S-Stop. What?

17:16.671 --> 17:20.671
I really need to talk to Archie.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.310
What was all that about?

17:25.311 --> 17:28.710
Right... so are you gonna tell me
what happened

17:28.711 --> 17:32.550
with that guy that you fancy?

17:32.551 --> 17:34.710
So... we kissed.

17:34.711 --> 17:36.670
Ugh, filth!

17:36.671 --> 17:38.230
But...

17:38.231 --> 17:41.910
I just...

17:41.911 --> 17:43.790
There was nothing.

17:43.791 --> 17:45.670
What do you mean?

17:45.671 --> 17:47.190
I'm shitting it, Rae.

17:47.191 --> 17:51.191
I've kissed girls and I've kissed
boys and I felt nothing.

17:51.991 --> 17:54.871
I'm starting to think
I've got no sexuality.

17:54.872 --> 17:58.390
Archie, how can you have
no sexuality?

17:58.391 --> 18:00.829
Especially when you're peeping
all the time.

18:00.830 --> 18:01.989
I did that three times.

18:01.990 --> 18:03.791
But you said it was...
All right!

18:03.792 --> 18:07.791
Less than ten times.

18:08.631 --> 18:12.631
I'm just a bit of a mess right now.

18:12.991 --> 18:16.590
Archie, come here.

18:16.591 --> 18:20.150
All right, love birds?
Hey, Chop.

18:20.151 --> 18:21.830
Where's Finn?

18:21.831 --> 18:24.269
He's gone off home to his mum.
His gran's not well.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.631
Don't say owt, but he's pretty
cut up about it.

18:26.632 --> 18:28.790
Here he is, the big knobhead.

18:28.791 --> 18:30.070
What?

18:30.071 --> 18:34.071
So, Raemundo, a little birdie
told me you've got an empty.

18:34.471 --> 18:37.151
Chop!
What? I didn't tell her who told me.

18:37.152 --> 18:40.990
Anyway... you know what
I'm thinking...

18:40.991 --> 18:42.670
No, no parties.

18:42.671 --> 18:46.429
I'm not talking any old party.
I'm talking a sexy party.

18:46.430 --> 18:50.431
What's a sexy party? It's exactly
the same as a normal party,

18:50.471 --> 18:51.829
but everyone brings sleeping bags

18:51.830 --> 18:53.629
and no-one asks any questions
in the morning.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.189
Oh, so it's basically like
a sleepover, yeah?

18:55.190 --> 18:58.711
Can I borrow a duvet, Rae,
cos I haven't got a sleeping bag.

18:58.712 --> 19:01.270
Oh, no, cos we're not having a party,

19:01.271 --> 19:04.270
sexy or otherwise.

19:04.271 --> 19:06.431
Oh, my God, Finn, show everyone
your love letter.

19:06.432 --> 19:07.830
Huh?

19:07.831 --> 19:09.430
Oh, who's that?

19:09.431 --> 19:10.831
Finn's got an admirer.

19:10.832 --> 19:12.190
What?

19:12.191 --> 19:15.430
Let's see it. Get it out.

19:15.431 --> 19:17.030
Pink.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.070
Ooh!

19:18.071 --> 19:20.750
"Dear Finn, you are so fit
and lovely.

19:20.751 --> 19:22.550
"I want to make you mine.

19:22.551 --> 19:25.390
"Love from... X."

19:25.391 --> 19:26.590
Ooh!

19:26.591 --> 19:30.591
Who would even send a love letter?
That is so stupid.

19:31.751 --> 19:33.829
It's franked from Lincolnshire,
so it must be a local girl.

19:33.830 --> 19:36.309
But all letters are stamped
"Lincolnshire"

19:36.310 --> 19:38.389
if that's where they're delivered.

19:38.390 --> 19:42.391
What? Letters are stamped where
they're sent from, not sent to.

19:42.791 --> 19:44.470
You're not serious?

19:44.471 --> 19:46.030
You're 16 years old

19:46.031 --> 19:49.431
and you think letters are stamped
where they're sent... to?

19:49.432 --> 19:53.431
It's what my mum said.

19:55.911 --> 19:57.151
I'm joking.

21:29.100 --> 21:34.196
Diary, maybe I wasn't the only one
with a backpack full of bullshit.

21:34.652 --> 21:36.510
Maybe most people had at least

21:36.559 --> 21:39.600
a pocket full of bullshit on them
at all times.

21:39.601 --> 21:43.039
But that didn't mean everyone did.

21:43.040 --> 21:47.040
And it didn't mean I had to.

21:48.720 --> 21:52.720
In some ways, I never wanted to see
my mum's face ever again.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.920
In some ways, I couldn't wait
for her to get back,

21:56.015 --> 21:59.133
so I could finally destroy her.

21:59.146 --> 22:00.885
Chop? "All right, Rae!"

22:00.952 --> 22:03.231
So how do you host a sexy party?

22:03.738 --> 22:07.738
"Whoo! Yes!"

22:14.018 --> 22:16.018
All right, Rae?

22:19.338 --> 22:21.737
Hey! Mwah!

22:21.738 --> 22:23.738
All right, Rae. Give us a hug.

22:23.739 --> 22:26.017
No.

22:26.018 --> 22:28.938
I've got a no-hugging policy.
You just hugged Archie.

22:28.939 --> 22:32.938
Yeah, I just implemented it
in the last few seconds.

22:37.698 --> 22:41.416
What are you doing? I said come round
at seven. You're three hours early.

22:41.417 --> 22:43.736
I just thought I'd give you
a bit of time to bed in.

22:43.737 --> 22:47.738
Bed in? Chop, sexy parties aren't as
big as normal parties, are they?

22:48.378 --> 22:50.576
No. It's very much
an intimate affair.

22:50.577 --> 22:52.738
Just a few guests.
Don't you worry.

22:56.218 --> 22:58.737
Chloe.

22:59.521 --> 23:00.600
What?

23:00.601 --> 23:03.720
- Nice one.
- What?

23:03.721 --> 23:06.239
I've got a bit of a problem.
Well, what's up?

23:06.240 --> 23:07.681
I've got therapy in an hour.

23:07.682 --> 23:09.760
Skip it. I can't.

23:09.761 --> 23:11.999
Right, so what are you going
to tell them, then?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.239
Oh, bollocks to it,
I'm just going to tell them all.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.401
Rae, I've thought about that
and I don't think you should.

23:16.402 --> 23:17.840
Well, why not?

23:17.841 --> 23:21.759
They're my friends, Chloe, they're
not going to judge me. You didn't.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.281
Well, they might
treat you differently.

23:23.282 --> 23:27.281
Besides, it is none
of their business.

23:27.561 --> 23:28.841
But I'm sick of lying.

23:28.842 --> 23:30.640
Rae, everyone lies.

23:30.641 --> 23:33.601
I don't believe that.
Oh, Chloe, I can't believe that.

23:33.602 --> 23:36.520
Rae, listen to me.

23:36.521 --> 23:38.320
They might not understand.

23:38.321 --> 23:42.121
Are you sure you want to take
that risk?

23:42.179 --> 23:43.538
Look, don't.

23:43.539 --> 23:46.018
Everyone...
Yeah, here we go.

23:46.019 --> 23:49.498
I've, um... got to nip out for a bit.

23:49.499 --> 23:52.058
So... don't trash the place.

23:52.059 --> 23:53.339
What? Where are you going?

23:53.340 --> 23:56.138
Um...
She's got to go to her uncle's.

23:56.139 --> 23:57.459
Get some more booze.

23:57.460 --> 24:00.898
Sweet. Sweet.

24:00.899 --> 24:02.298
Here y'are, Rae.

24:02.299 --> 24:05.257
I've got some tunes here
that you might not have.

24:05.258 --> 24:08.337
Right, just stick them
by the rest of the CDs then.

24:08.338 --> 24:10.237
But I don't step on your toes
music-wise.

24:10.319 --> 24:11.598
I know how you like to think

24:11.599 --> 24:14.280
you have that superior knowledge of
music and all that.

24:14.281 --> 24:17.719
Yeah, right. Whatever.

24:17.720 --> 24:21.720
I've got to go.

24:22.200 --> 24:26.200
Right. See you later, buddy.

24:26.920 --> 24:29.559
Buddy? Buddy.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.999
This is not good.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.718
You are at the very brink of the
border of the friend zone.

24:33.719 --> 24:36.078
You're at the checkpoint.
So what do I do?

24:36.079 --> 24:39.440
You need tension,
you need to do something drastic.

24:39.441 --> 24:43.440
You need to make him see you
in a romantic way.

24:44.160 --> 24:47.238
I'll come to the party. I'll
pretend to be your ex-boyfriend.

24:47.239 --> 24:49.840
I'll tell everybody how amazing
you were when we were going out.

24:49.841 --> 24:51.239
How good in bed.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.839
What? Why not?

24:52.840 --> 24:56.079
Because it's just more bullshit.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.758
I don't give a shit, that's why.
Please, keep your voice down.

24:58.759 --> 25:01.678
This is where I work.
Don't tell me to keep my voice down.

25:01.679 --> 25:04.438
What do you want me to say?
I don't want you to say anything.

25:04.439 --> 25:06.078
I tried, there's no point.

25:06.079 --> 25:10.080
What are we going to do about
the car? I need this for work.

25:10.160 --> 25:14.160
Oh, for fuck's sake!

25:14.560 --> 25:17.999
So how is the new Rae thing going?

25:18.000 --> 25:20.680
I don't think everyone's ready
for the new Rae.

25:20.681 --> 25:24.119
Well, they'd better start
getting ready.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.478
So how are you coping
with your mum being away?

25:26.479 --> 25:28.358
The first time you've been
on your own

25:28.359 --> 25:30.158
since the night you came in, right?

25:30.159 --> 25:31.800
Yeah, but that was only bad

25:31.801 --> 25:35.800
because there was no-one there
to stop me sinking.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.079
What started you sinking?

25:40.080 --> 25:44.080
I was just alone and... miserable.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.400
It's just random bad thoughts,
isn't it?

25:46.401 --> 25:48.039
No.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.399
Behaviour...

25:49.400 --> 25:51.359
it's not chaotic.

25:51.360 --> 25:54.759
Being on your own that night
was just a trigger.

25:54.760 --> 25:58.158
What we need to figure out is
why you don't like yourself.

25:58.159 --> 26:01.758
We need to start digging deeper,
looking at things in your past

26:01.759 --> 26:03.918
and seeing how you've made sense
of them,

26:03.919 --> 26:06.840
things you might not have thought
about for years.

26:09.040 --> 26:13.039
You said that being honest
made you feel better.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.879
Well, this is about being
really honest.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.879
Painfully so.

26:17.880 --> 26:21.880
About being honest with yourself.

26:23.960 --> 26:27.919
You know you can talk to me
about stuff, don't you?

26:27.920 --> 26:30.079
What do you mean?
I mean...

26:30.080 --> 26:34.039
what have you been up to
the last few days?

26:34.040 --> 26:37.160
Oh, not much, my life
isn't as interesting as yours.

26:37.161 --> 26:39.479
Has anything happened?

26:39.480 --> 26:41.759
No, nothing's happened.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.959
My life's very dull.

26:43.960 --> 26:47.960
So, we can talk about anything
as long as it's to do with me,

26:48.680 --> 26:50.440
that's just the way it is?

26:50.441 --> 26:54.319
I'm sorry,
have I missed something here?

26:54.320 --> 26:57.919
Just forget it.

26:57.920 --> 27:01.279
OK, let's go back
to the night you came in.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.600
Let's just start examining how you
were feeling,

27:04.601 --> 27:08.319
what you were thinking.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.519
I can't remember.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.240
You can't remember what happened?

27:11.241 --> 27:12.599
No.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.680
Well, that's quite common.
A lot of people have...

27:14.681 --> 27:17.159
'Why should you be honest?

27:17.160 --> 27:20.479
'Why should you ever tell anyone
anything?

27:20.480 --> 27:23.278
'Adults will tell you
that you should always be truthful,

27:23.279 --> 27:25.560
'but they're as full of it
as everyone else.'

27:25.561 --> 27:28.119
but it's all in there somewhere.

27:28.120 --> 27:29.279
I'm sure it is.

27:29.280 --> 27:33.280
Look, can we finish early,
I've got something on.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.359
Chop.

27:59.360 --> 28:03.119
Chop. Chop!

28:03.120 --> 28:04.199
What happened?

28:04.200 --> 28:05.758
Yeah, the numbers seem
to have swelled up a bit,

28:05.759 --> 28:07.038
but I know everyone here personally.

28:07.039 --> 28:10.120
I can vouch for every one of them.
Who's that, then?

28:10.121 --> 28:11.239
Hannah.

28:11.240 --> 28:12.640
All right, who's that?

28:12.641 --> 28:15.159
Hannah.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.160
All right, so I don't know everyone.

28:17.161 --> 28:21.160
For example,
he's definitely not from Stamford.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.159
Danny.
Oh, here she is.

28:28.160 --> 28:31.478
I've been telling everybody about
when we were going out, you know.

28:31.479 --> 28:33.718
Our romantic break in Staffordshire.
You did what?

28:33.719 --> 28:34.598
Anyway, like I said,

28:34.599 --> 28:36.960
even though we bought a two-day pass
for Alton Towers,

28:36.961 --> 28:40.279
we didn't really want to leave
the hotel room.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.600
I've still never been
on the Corkscrew.

28:42.601 --> 28:44.239
Rae, that is so wild.

28:44.240 --> 28:48.240
Good... good times.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.318
Next thing I know,
we were at reception

28:53.319 --> 28:55.758
and she said,
"Can you keep the noise down a bit?

28:55.759 --> 28:57.040
"We've had complaints
from next door."

28:57.041 --> 29:00.839
That's a load of bollocks, that,
isn't it?

29:00.840 --> 29:03.759
Isn't it?

29:03.760 --> 29:05.638
Why didn't you tell me you were
going out

29:05.639 --> 29:07.118
with someone at the hospital?

29:07.119 --> 29:09.238
How do you know he's
from the hospital?

29:09.239 --> 29:10.718
I don't know, he's a bit odd.

29:10.719 --> 29:12.120
I said to just turn the TV up,

29:12.121 --> 29:14.519
or just enjoy the park,

29:14.520 --> 29:18.520
like the rest of the people
who do it, know what I mean?

29:20.040 --> 29:22.278
Listen, Rae, please don't make
me leave.

29:22.279 --> 29:24.320
It's so boring back at the hospital.

29:24.321 --> 29:25.439
Danny...

29:25.440 --> 29:28.038
Listen, I've been telling everyone
what an amazing lover you are.

29:28.039 --> 29:29.918
You know, not too gentle
and not too strong,

29:29.919 --> 29:33.160
that perfect harmonious pitch
between giving and greedy.

29:33.161 --> 29:36.079
Right, Danny, you can stay.

29:36.080 --> 29:39.319
Just... just don't do anything crazy.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.238
But I am crazy.
I've got a certificate

29:41.239 --> 29:43.160
from the Government that proves it.

29:43.161 --> 29:47.160
Listen, do they all know
that you've been ill?

29:47.840 --> 29:51.439
I'm going to tell them in
my own time.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.679
Just promise me, yeah?

29:53.680 --> 29:57.680
I promise, Scout's honour.

30:01.920 --> 30:05.599
Archie, who has he been talking to?

30:05.600 --> 30:07.119
I don't know.

30:07.120 --> 30:11.120
But I think he might have found out
who sent him that love letter.

30:12.240 --> 30:15.759
Rae, mind if I use your phone
to ring home?

30:15.760 --> 30:17.280
There's one in my mum's room.

30:17.281 --> 30:21.280
I'm going to freshen up,
so I'll show you where it is.

30:22.800 --> 30:24.198
You're being way too subtle.

30:24.199 --> 30:26.198
Remember, he's a boy,
we don't do subtle.

30:26.199 --> 30:28.160
Ignore him, you need tension.

30:41.320 --> 30:45.039
Is this where the party is?

30:45.040 --> 30:46.718
Come on, we ain't gonna
cause any trouble.

30:46.719 --> 30:48.078
Everything all right here, Rae?

30:48.079 --> 30:49.198
Who's this mickey?

30:49.199 --> 30:50.480
I'm her ex-boyfriend.

30:50.481 --> 30:52.599
Jesus, you poor fucker!

30:52.600 --> 30:53.798
Is there going to be a problem here?

30:53.799 --> 30:55.598
Yeah, there is going to be
a problem.

30:55.599 --> 30:57.278
What are you going to do
about it?

30:57.279 --> 30:59.638
I don't know.
I'm a bit mental, you see.

30:59.639 --> 31:01.838
I'm a bit unpredictable.
Right, well,

31:01.839 --> 31:04.800
why don't you piss off inside
before I get unpredictable?

31:04.801 --> 31:06.999
What do you lot want?

31:07.000 --> 31:09.080
Nothing, I just want to have
a drink.

31:09.081 --> 31:10.599
You're not welcome.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.118
I told my brother
about Finn last week

31:12.119 --> 31:13.758
and he said if any of you
touch me again,

31:13.759 --> 31:15.080
he's gonna knock you out.

31:15.081 --> 31:17.479
Yeah, well, you're not coming in.

31:17.480 --> 31:20.080
I guess we'll just have to stand
here all night.

31:20.081 --> 31:22.400
Jog on, you big bunch of fannies.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.439
You fuckin' scumbag!

31:24.440 --> 31:25.960
Go on, fuck off!

31:41.240 --> 31:45.240
Right, right, we'll have a couple
of rounds of normal spin the bottle,

31:46.200 --> 31:47.999
just as a warm-up.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
Then we can spice things up a bit.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.200
You know he only organises
things like this

31:57.201 --> 32:00.439
so he can get off with someone,
don't you?

32:00.440 --> 32:01.519
Rae.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.159
Rae!

32:03.160 --> 32:05.079
What?

32:05.080 --> 32:06.518
Seriously, are you deaf?

32:06.519 --> 32:08.078
How? I couldn't hear you.

32:08.079 --> 32:09.400
Of course you could hear me.

32:09.401 --> 32:11.559
Right, one, two, three.

32:11.560 --> 32:14.640
Ohhhhh!

32:15.600 --> 32:18.039
The almighty Barnstaple!
Yes!

32:18.040 --> 32:19.359
Next one.

32:19.360 --> 32:23.360
Ohhhh!

32:24.600 --> 32:25.759
Archibald.

32:25.760 --> 32:28.719
I'm not even playing, mate, no.

32:28.720 --> 32:30.280
No.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.959
So... so who's this Danny guy then?

32:38.960 --> 32:40.359
What's it to you?

32:40.360 --> 32:42.438
It's nowt to me, I just wondered

32:42.439 --> 32:45.038
what school he went to
or if he's from around here.

32:45.039 --> 32:46.640
No, he's not from around here.

32:46.641 --> 32:47.839
Ready?

32:47.840 --> 32:51.840
Ohhhhhhh!

32:55.720 --> 32:59.039
Again. Whoa, whoa, yeah.

32:59.040 --> 33:00.640
Go and get me a drink. What?

33:00.641 --> 33:03.120
Quick, now.
Get your own drink.

33:04.760 --> 33:08.760
Go on, lad, get in there!

33:17.480 --> 33:19.518
Right, right, no messing about.

33:19.519 --> 33:21.078
We're upping the stakes.

33:21.079 --> 33:25.080
Couples have to go into the landing
cupboard together, for a minute.

33:25.280 --> 33:29.280
No exceptions, you cheeky little...

33:30.480 --> 33:32.880
Ohhhhhhh!

33:34.480 --> 33:36.599
Raemundo!

33:36.600 --> 33:38.720
She's only going in the cupboard
of lust.

33:38.721 --> 33:40.599
But who will it be with?

33:40.600 --> 33:41.959
Whoo!

33:41.960 --> 33:45.960
One, two, three.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.720
'I wished for Archie.

33:47.721 --> 33:50.879
'We could just go in there and
chat.

33:50.880 --> 33:54.799
'I wished for Chop,
just a friendly fumble.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.280
'I just wished for someone

33:56.281 --> 34:00.280
'who wouldn't be disappointed that
they had the kiss me.

34:00.560 --> 34:01.599
'Oh, my God!

34:01.600 --> 34:03.559
'What if it's Finn?

34:03.560 --> 34:05.439
'What if my breath smells?

34:05.440 --> 34:08.079
'What if I burp in his mouth?

34:08.080 --> 34:12.080
'It won't be Finn, it won't be Finn,
it won't be Finn.

34:12.480 --> 34:16.480
'Oh, shit!'

34:37.000 --> 34:38.279
Rae?

34:38.280 --> 34:39.918
Yeah.

34:39.920 --> 34:43.080
Why are you being
such a complete knobhead to me?

34:43.081 --> 34:44.199
Sorry?

34:44.199 --> 34:47.039
Did I do something to annoy you?

34:47.040 --> 34:49.359
No, I just...

34:49.360 --> 34:51.078
Then why are you mugging me off
all the time?

34:51.079 --> 34:53.358
I apologised for being a bit funny
when they first met,

34:53.359 --> 34:54.998
but that's because
I didn't know you.

34:54.998 --> 34:56.797
Now, one minute
you're dead nice to me

34:56.799 --> 34:59.000
and the next you're just being
totally rude.

34:59.001 --> 35:00.999
I'm not trying to be rude.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.879
Then maybe it just comes naturally
to you.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.840
I thought we were getting on.

35:06.841 --> 35:09.199
30 seconds left, love birds.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.040
It's not as simple as that, is it?

35:11.041 --> 35:13.079
It is as simple as that, Rae.

35:13.080 --> 35:15.518
Either we're friends
or we're not friends.

35:15.519 --> 35:17.200
Maybe I don't want to be your friend.

35:17.201 --> 35:18.879
You what?

35:18.880 --> 35:20.039
Maybe...

35:20.040 --> 35:22.759
I don't want to be your friend.

35:22.760 --> 35:24.319
Why not?

35:29.040 --> 35:32.319
Hey-hey! Right, who's next?

36:00.348 --> 36:03.186
I'm not being funny,
but can we stop playing this now?

36:03.196 --> 36:04.955
No, I haven't kissed anyone yet.

36:04.956 --> 36:06.955
Are you even capable of still
kissing someone?

36:06.956 --> 36:09.297
I don't think anyone else
is playing.

36:09.314 --> 36:10.312
I'm playing.

36:10.313 --> 36:11.951
Well, great, you two kiss
each other then.

36:11.952 --> 36:13.273
Everyone else can just chill out.

36:13.274 --> 36:15.432
What?! Izzy?

36:15.433 --> 36:19.433
Jesus!

36:33.833 --> 36:35.072
Eww!

36:35.073 --> 36:39.032
It's like kissing a corpse.

36:39.033 --> 36:43.033
Ugh! Minging!

36:52.753 --> 36:55.552
Chop.

36:55.553 --> 36:59.553
Where's Finn?

37:05.393 --> 37:06.993
Finn?

37:09.433 --> 37:13.433
Oh, shit.

37:14.993 --> 37:18.993
Oh, Finn, I'm so sorry.

37:21.233 --> 37:24.432
Sorry.

37:24.433 --> 37:26.113
Oh, it's all right.

38:21.793 --> 38:23.713
I thought you weren't having
a party.

38:23.714 --> 38:27.713
I wanted to piss my mum off.

38:28.313 --> 38:29.712
Are you all right?

38:29.713 --> 38:32.952
Yeah, I suppose.

38:32.953 --> 38:34.592
You'd have liked my nan.

38:34.593 --> 38:38.593
She was always talking about
something.

38:38.993 --> 38:40.753
What are you trying to say?

38:40.754 --> 38:44.352
Nothing. Just... you're always
banging on about it.

38:44.353 --> 38:46.512
You cheeky bas...

38:46.593 --> 38:47.952
No, in a good way.

38:47.953 --> 38:51.032
I like it.

38:51.033 --> 38:53.592
I like talking to you.

38:53.593 --> 38:57.593
And I don't like talking to anybody.

39:01.073 --> 39:03.792
So are we all right?

39:03.793 --> 39:07.793
Yeah. We're all right.

40:14.474 --> 40:17.192
Are you all right?

40:17.193 --> 40:20.152
You seem happy today.

40:20.153 --> 40:22.752
I'm gay, Rae.

40:22.753 --> 40:25.072
Are you pleased about it?

40:25.073 --> 40:26.832
I'm fucking delirious.

40:48.673 --> 40:51.192
Here it is, Churchill.

40:51.193 --> 40:53.072
Where's Tix?

40:53.073 --> 40:55.233
It was... it was something about...

40:55.234 --> 40:57.512
- Danny?
- Danny, it's Rae.

40:57.513 --> 40:58.591
I've had a great time.

40:58.592 --> 41:00.713
It's just nice to get out of the
hospital, isn't it?

41:00.714 --> 41:04.712
It was noisy, wasn't it?
It was... it was something.

41:04.713 --> 41:06.272
Yeah.

41:06.273 --> 41:09.353
It was about something, wasn't it?
It was nice.

41:09.354 --> 41:12.072
Loud.
Yeah. Right, come on.

41:12.073 --> 41:13.352
Noise.

41:13.353 --> 41:14.593
Music.

41:16.233 --> 41:17.552
All right?

41:33.394 --> 41:35.032
Will he be all right?

41:35.033 --> 41:36.712
Yeah, he's fine.

41:36.713 --> 41:38.433
Do you need your hat back?

41:38.434 --> 41:42.192
No, mate, it's yours.
You can keep it.

41:42.193 --> 41:46.072
All right, I'll see you later.
See you.

41:46.073 --> 41:47.832
Thanks.

41:47.833 --> 41:51.672
Bye. Bye.

41:51.673 --> 41:53.472
Oh, bye.

41:53.473 --> 41:57.473
Yeah.

41:57.633 --> 42:01.633
I'll give you a ring this week,
yeah? All right, cool.

42:17.273 --> 42:18.833
I hope he's going to be all right.

42:18.834 --> 42:22.272
Yeah, he'll be fine
when he gets back.

42:22.273 --> 42:26.273
Chloe, listen, I was thinking,
you know about me telling everyone?

42:27.033 --> 42:29.392
Let's just keep it between us.

42:29.393 --> 42:33.393
OK.

42:34.433 --> 42:38.433
So, what happened with you and Finn
in the cupboard last night?

42:38.953 --> 42:41.392
It was interesting.

42:41.393 --> 42:45.393
Can I tell you something?
What?

42:45.913 --> 42:49.072
It was me who sent the letter
to Finn.

42:49.073 --> 42:51.712
What? When did you do that?

42:51.713 --> 42:54.032
When I broke up with Stephen.

42:54.033 --> 42:56.592
I just... wanted to feel normal.

42:56.593 --> 43:00.112
You know, be involved
in something normal.

43:00.113 --> 43:04.032
Does that even make sense?
No.

43:04.033 --> 43:07.631
The more time I spent with him this
week, I don't know, I just...

43:07.632 --> 43:10.233
I think there's something about him.
D'you know what I mean?

43:10.234 --> 43:11.272
Definitely not.

43:11.273 --> 43:13.153
Watch this space, anyway.
No.

43:13.154 --> 43:15.752
What? What?

43:15.753 --> 43:19.753
Do you like anyone at the minute?

43:20.873 --> 43:22.072
No.

43:22.073 --> 43:26.073
No. No.

43:29.193 --> 43:32.233
'Maybe some bullshit is best
kept in your pocket.

43:32.234 --> 43:34.232
'Or your backpack.

43:34.233 --> 43:38.233
'Or even your Olympic-sized
swimming pool.'

43:41.713 --> 43:43.511
The weather here is relentless.

43:43.512 --> 43:46.713
They've called off the local games -
no caber tossing for this year.

43:48.073 --> 43:50.313
I don't know if you've heard of
a rock band called Oasis.

43:50.314 --> 43:53.792
Anyway, I'm rockin'
out. You'd be embarrassed.

43:53.793 --> 43:55.552
I hope school is OK.

43:55.553 --> 43:57.392
I was terrible at school.

43:57.393 --> 43:59.793
Don't feel bad if you get frustrated
with your exams,

43:59.794 --> 44:02.392
it's a really difficult time.

44:02.393 --> 44:05.231
But know that I love you
and care about you so much,

44:05.232 --> 44:07.273
even though it may not seem like it.

44:07.274 --> 44:09.152
Hiya, chuck!

44:09.153 --> 44:11.872
Hello.
We're back.

44:11.873 --> 44:14.192
Oh, my God!

44:14.193 --> 44:18.193
Right, I'm going to put a brew on.
Karim, tell her.

44:21.873 --> 44:25.232
Er... we are...

44:25.233 --> 44:26.312
Married!

44:26.313 --> 44:27.832
Yes, marriage.

44:27.833 --> 44:30.992
Married!

44:30.993 --> 44:34.073
Well, what do you think about it,
Rae? No more sneaking about.

44:34.074 --> 44:36.992
Karim can stay.
What do you think?

44:36.993 --> 44:40.993
I know it's a bit sudden,
but we had no choice, really.

44:54.913 --> 44:58.913
Is everything all right?

45:05.273 --> 45:09.273
What?

45:12.553 --> 45:14.193
Congratulations.

45:15.968 --> 45:24.437
