WEBVTT

00:03.462 --> 00:05.046
Got my keys.

00:05.088 --> 00:06.465
Got my wallet. What...?

00:06.507 --> 00:08.049
Ah... (chuckles)

00:08.091 --> 00:09.760
Grocery list.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.517

00:17.893 --> 00:19.520

Stevie,

00:59.852 --> 01:01.311
for the last time,

01:01.353 --> 01:03.146
I'm not going to

01:01.353 --> 01:03.146
partner up with you

01:03.188 --> 01:04.732
for wheelchair

01:03.188 --> 01:04.732
basketball.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.108
I smell... chicken.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.903
I'm not

01:07.150 --> 01:08.903
in a wheelchair.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.195
It's creepy.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.655
It's taking a spot

01:10.237 --> 01:11.655
from somebody

01:11.697 --> 01:13.490
who's really

01:11.697 --> 01:13.490
handicapped.

01:13.532 --> 01:15.534
Why don't you ask

01:13.532 --> 01:15.534
that drooling kid

01:15.576 --> 01:16.952
with the hot nurse?

01:16.994 --> 01:19.830
Norm's...

01:16.994 --> 01:19.830
a ball hog.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.122
Hello, boys.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.122
Mr. Kenarban,

01:21.164 --> 01:22.875
don't you think

01:21.164 --> 01:22.875
it's ethically suspect

01:22.917 --> 01:24.960
for someone to participate

01:22.917 --> 01:24.960
in wheelchair basketball

01:25.002 --> 01:26.503
if they're not

01:25.002 --> 01:26.503
actually handicapped?

01:26.545 --> 01:31.132
Even if his best

01:26.545 --> 01:31.132
friend needs to win...

01:31.174 --> 01:33.844
for his mother?

01:33.886 --> 01:35.470
Son, after being

01:33.886 --> 01:35.470
gone two months,

01:35.512 --> 01:37.723
your mom will be happy as

01:35.512 --> 01:37.723
a duck just to see you.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.558
I know she's been

01:37.765 --> 01:39.558
gone a long time, Stevie,

01:39.600 --> 01:41.142
but it just doesn't

01:39.600 --> 01:41.142
feel right to me.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.228
I've always...

01:43.270 --> 01:45.146
been there...

01:45.188 --> 01:46.356
for you.

01:46.398 --> 01:47.649
Please don't

01:46.398 --> 01:47.649
do this to me.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.484
Seventh grade...

01:49.526 --> 01:51.152
first dance...

01:51.194 --> 01:53.572
open fly.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.574
All right, fine. But

01:53.614 --> 01:55.574
I'm sick and tired of you

01:55.616 --> 01:57.158
throwing that in

01:55.616 --> 01:57.158
my face all the time.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.913
Save it... for the game.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.165
Come on, Jamie,

02:02.205 --> 02:04.165
I got to get to work.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.251
Eat. You'll stick a cockroach

02:04.207 --> 02:06.251
in your mouth,

02:06.293 --> 02:07.753
and you won't even taste this?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.671
Here, Dewey,

02:07.795 --> 02:09.671
you're good with the baby.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.172
No, I'm not. You're

02:09.713 --> 02:11.172
just saying that.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.674
Aw, you caught me.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.676
Your reward is you

02:12.716 --> 02:14.676
get to feed the baby.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.177
I got to run.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.472
What are you doing with

02:16.219 --> 02:18.472
my high school diary?

02:18.513 --> 02:20.557
I was looking for a baby book

02:18.513 --> 02:20.557
we can use for Jamie.

02:20.599 --> 02:23.393
Turns out we didn't even take

02:20.599 --> 02:23.393
the cellophane off Dewey's.

02:23.435 --> 02:26.021
Malcolm, Reese,

02:23.435 --> 02:26.021
get a move on!

02:26.063 --> 02:28.189
What on earth

02:26.063 --> 02:28.189
are you doing?

02:28.231 --> 02:29.817
I have to practice

02:28.231 --> 02:29.817
being in a wheelchair.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.735
Oh...

02:29.858 --> 02:31.735
I suppose that makes sense.

02:31.777 --> 02:32.694
You never know.

02:31.777 --> 02:32.694
All it takes is one

02:32.736 --> 02:34.195
horrible accident,

02:32.736 --> 02:34.195
and you end up

02:34.237 --> 02:36.115
in one of those

02:34.237 --> 02:36.115
for the rest of your life.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.282
It's just for basketball.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.784
That's the spirit.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.119
Reese!

02:40.160 --> 02:41.202
What is taking you so long?

02:41.244 --> 02:42.203
Why don't you

02:42.245 --> 02:44.205
just admit it--

02:42.245 --> 02:44.205
nobody in this house

02:44.247 --> 02:45.833
cares about my hair but me!

02:47.793 --> 02:49.210
Let's go! Come on!

02:49.252 --> 02:51.212
Come on, Jamie,

02:49.252 --> 02:51.212
just eat it.

02:51.254 --> 02:54.049
It's not that bad.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.550
See?

02:56.468 --> 02:58.177
I don't hate it.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.892
Mmm!

03:09.272 --> 03:11.232
What did the vet

03:09.272 --> 03:11.232
say about Paint Can?

03:11.274 --> 03:13.234
Oh, she's fine.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.444
Just fine.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.237
It's terrible news.

03:16.279 --> 03:19.240
She has acute laminitis

03:16.279 --> 03:19.240
in her hoof.

03:19.282 --> 03:22.369
I'm afraid we will

03:19.282 --> 03:22.369
have to put her down.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.453
You mean kill her?

03:23.495 --> 03:24.454
Uh-huh.

03:24.496 --> 03:27.082
Oh, the poor thing.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.042
Who's going

03:27.124 --> 03:28.042
to have to do it?

03:28.083 --> 03:30.002
We will have

03:28.083 --> 03:30.002
to do it, Francis.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.879
You're kidding.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.879
We have no choice.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.088
After all,

03:33.130 --> 03:34.339
we are real ranchers.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.591
We must be strong

03:34.381 --> 03:36.591
and determined,

03:36.633 --> 03:39.260
and never shirk from

03:36.633 --> 03:39.260
our responsibilities,

03:39.302 --> 03:41.596
no matter how unpleasant

03:39.302 --> 03:41.596
they may be.

03:43.015 --> 03:45.308
You're going to make me do this,

03:43.015 --> 03:45.308
aren't you?

03:46.393 --> 03:48.228
Otto?

04:08.331 --> 04:11.418
LOIS:

04:08.331 --> 04:11.418
Dewey, get out here or I'm going

04:08.331 --> 04:11.418
to throw your dinner away!

04:11.459 --> 04:13.170
Okay.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.508
This meal

04:15.338 --> 04:18.508
looks fantastic, Lois.

04:18.550 --> 04:21.053
Thank you so much

04:18.550 --> 04:21.053
for the invitation.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.387
Well, we figured with Kitty

04:21.095 --> 04:22.387
coming home tomorrow,

04:22.429 --> 04:23.388
you'd like one last chance

04:23.430 --> 04:24.932
to enjoy meat.

04:25.682 --> 04:26.600
You're not

04:25.682 --> 04:26.600
going to believe

04:26.641 --> 04:27.893
what happened to me

04:26.641 --> 04:27.893
at school today.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.310
Some girl dropped her diary

04:29.352 --> 04:30.938
into my backpack by mistake.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.355
Do you know whose it is?

04:32.397 --> 04:33.941
No, but it's awesome.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.317
She talks about her teachers,

04:33.982 --> 04:36.317
classes, friends.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.737
It's like a whole world

04:36.359 --> 04:38.737
I never knew existed.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.321
Dig in, Stevie.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.699
That's real butter

04:40.363 --> 04:42.699
pooling on your plate.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.326
Can't eat. Too excited...

04:45.368 --> 04:48.329
about Mom coming home.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.331
I made her... a card.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.877
Baked her a cake.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.337
Wrote her a song.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.965
Stevie, you're going

04:56.379 --> 04:57.965
to black out again.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.926
Can we put up

04:58.006 --> 05:00.926
Chinese lanterns?

05:00.968 --> 05:02.343
You bet, son.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.304
Anything you want.

05:04.345 --> 05:07.099
Hal, I wonder if I could

05:04.345 --> 05:07.099
see you for just a moment.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.349
Oh, sure.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.768
Stevie is certainly excited

05:09.810 --> 05:11.686
about his mother

05:09.810 --> 05:11.686
coming home tomorrow.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.396
Kitty isn't

05:11.728 --> 05:13.396
on a business trip.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.898
She divorced me

05:13.438 --> 05:14.898
two months ago.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.357
She's never coming home.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.526
What?

05:16.399 --> 05:18.526
Kitty isn't

05:16.399 --> 05:18.526
on a business trip.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.987
She divorced me

05:18.568 --> 05:19.987
two months ago.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.280
She's never coming home.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.363
What?

05:22.405 --> 05:24.158
Kitty isn't on

05:22.405 --> 05:24.158
a business trip...

05:24.199 --> 05:26.160
No, it's not

05:24.199 --> 05:26.160
that kind of "what."

05:26.201 --> 05:28.162
Stevie thinks

05:26.201 --> 05:28.162
she's coming back tomorrow.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.164
I know I should

05:28.203 --> 05:30.164
have told him,

05:30.205 --> 05:31.999
but every time I'd

05:30.205 --> 05:31.999
look in his face--

05:32.040 --> 05:33.875
you know me, Hal.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.919
I've always had

05:33.917 --> 05:35.919
a hard time being...

05:35.961 --> 05:37.545
you know... direct.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.381
That was one of my

05:37.587 --> 05:40.381
problems with Kitty.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.383
That, and the utterly mechanical

05:40.423 --> 05:42.383
nature of our sex life.

05:42.425 --> 05:45.386
Look, Stevie has to know that

05:42.425 --> 05:45.386
his mother isn't coming back.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.680
You're absolutely right.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.389
Any way you could tell him?

05:48.431 --> 05:49.599
Why would I tell him?

05:49.641 --> 05:50.976
What's the matter?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.560
Kitty divorced Abe.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.560
She's not coming home.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.813
Oh, my God!

05:52.602 --> 05:54.813
What on earth happened?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.231
The truth is,

05:54.855 --> 05:56.231
the last few years,

05:56.273 --> 05:58.025
she only stayed with me

05:56.273 --> 05:58.025
because of Stevie.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.776
He's always been

05:58.066 --> 05:59.776
so sick and helpless.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.236
The whole marriage was built

06:01.278 --> 06:02.403
around taking care of him.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.404
Oh, I had no idea.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.614
Then,

06:03.446 --> 06:04.614
two months ago,

06:04.656 --> 06:06.325
she walked in and announced

06:06.365 --> 06:08.493
that Stevie was finally

06:06.365 --> 06:08.493
doing just fine.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.205
Then she packed her bags

06:08.535 --> 06:11.205
and left.

06:11.246 --> 06:12.413
Now, look, Abe,

06:11.246 --> 06:12.413
I'm really sorry,

06:12.455 --> 06:13.790
but Stevie

06:12.455 --> 06:13.790
still has to know.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.416
Abe, you have got

06:13.832 --> 06:15.416
to tell Stevie.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.626
Tell him what?

06:16.668 --> 06:18.419
None of your business.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.419
Get back to the table.

06:18.461 --> 06:21.840
How do I tell that poor boy

06:18.461 --> 06:21.840
his mother is never coming home?

06:21.882 --> 06:22.966
I'll tell him.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.218
I told you

06:23.008 --> 06:24.218
to get out of here.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.260
What's going on?

06:25.302 --> 06:26.511
Kitty and Abe

06:25.302 --> 06:26.511
got a divorce.

06:26.553 --> 06:27.595
Now, leave us alone.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.805
What?

06:28.847 --> 06:30.431
Abe, you have got

06:28.847 --> 06:30.431
to do the right thing

06:30.473 --> 06:31.516
and go in there now.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.433
What about Malcolm?

06:32.475 --> 06:33.434
Why can't he tell him?

06:33.476 --> 06:34.853
Wouldn't it be more comforting

06:34.895 --> 06:36.230
coming from his best friend?

06:36.271 --> 06:38.439
I said I'd tell him.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.192
Reese, out. Now!

06:40.234 --> 06:41.400
Why should I tell him?

06:41.442 --> 06:43.862
Well, you're not entirely

06:41.442 --> 06:43.862
blameless in this.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.822
What?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.822
You're the one

06:43.904 --> 06:45.822
who always pushed him

06:45.864 --> 06:49.450
to try new things--

06:45.864 --> 06:49.450
dances, ski trips, basketball.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.577
Before he met you,

06:50.618 --> 06:52.453
that boy could

06:50.618 --> 06:52.453
hardly handle a yo-yo.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.081
By what stretch

06:52.495 --> 06:54.081
of the imagination

06:54.122 --> 06:55.165
is this considered

06:55.207 --> 06:56.208
one full serving?

06:56.250 --> 06:57.458
Not now, Dewey.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.087
Abe, we are through talking

06:57.500 --> 07:00.087
about this. Now, go!

07:00.128 --> 07:01.880
Okay, I told him.

07:01.922 --> 07:02.839
What?

07:02.881 --> 07:03.882
He's taking it

07:02.881 --> 07:03.882
pretty hard.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.466
Somebody should

07:03.924 --> 07:05.466
probably go over there

07:05.508 --> 07:06.843
and talk to him.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.274
It's really weird.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.482
It's only been three days

07:21.524 --> 07:23.193
since Stevie found out

07:21.524 --> 07:23.193
about him mom,

07:23.235 --> 07:25.028
but he's regressed, like,

07:23.235 --> 07:25.028
ten years.

07:29.616 --> 07:33.494
So, I think

07:29.616 --> 07:33.494
we can beat these guys.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.496
We just can't be afraid

07:35.538 --> 07:37.791
to get physical

07:35.538 --> 07:37.791
under the boards.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.002
(deep sigh)

07:46.216 --> 07:47.550
Come on, Stevie.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.178
I know you're going

07:47.592 --> 07:50.178
through a hard time,

07:50.220 --> 07:51.554
but we're

07:50.220 --> 07:51.554
in the tournament.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.182
This might help take your

07:51.596 --> 07:54.182
mind off of it for a while.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.393
Just talk

07:54.224 --> 07:56.393
to me, Stevie.

07:56.435 --> 07:58.270
I know you're

07:56.435 --> 07:58.270
not this far gone.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.566
VOICE BOX:

08:01.564 --> 08:03.566
You don't know anything

08:03.608 --> 08:06.527
about what I am going through

08:03.608 --> 08:06.527
or how I feel.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.529
Now, if you don't mind,

08:06.569 --> 08:08.529
I'd like to conserve

08:08.571 --> 08:11.532
my remaining strength

08:08.571 --> 08:11.532
for breathing.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.617
(deep sigh)

08:12.659 --> 08:14.119
And stop using that.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.578
You can

08:14.161 --> 08:15.578
talk perfectly...

08:15.620 --> 08:17.497
You don't

08:15.620 --> 08:17.497
need that thing.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.000
Fine.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.836
MALCOLM:

08:21.209 --> 08:22.836
If you're not going

08:21.209 --> 08:22.836
to talk to me,

08:22.877 --> 08:24.504
I'm out of here.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.219
DEWEY:

08:28.758 --> 08:31.219
This whole

08:28.758 --> 08:31.219
growing up thing's unfair.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.762
When you're born,

08:32.804 --> 08:34.139
everything's perfect,

08:34.181 --> 08:36.599
but before you know it,

08:34.181 --> 08:36.599
it all goes bad.

08:36.641 --> 08:39.186
Every day, you get

08:36.641 --> 08:39.186
a little less attention,

08:39.227 --> 08:40.561
you got

08:39.227 --> 08:40.561
to do more stuff.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.230
and they love you

08:40.603 --> 08:42.230
a little less.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.399
No. That's

08:42.272 --> 08:44.399
just this family.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.608
Reese!

08:45.650 --> 08:47.568
How many time do

08:45.650 --> 08:47.568
I have to tell you,

08:47.610 --> 08:50.530
don't leave your filthy socks

08:47.610 --> 08:50.530
on the kitchen table!

08:52.199 --> 08:56.036
LOIS:

08:52.199 --> 08:56.036
"September 18.

08:52.199 --> 08:56.036
What an aggravating day.

08:57.829 --> 09:01.416
"Some idiot named Hal

08:57.829 --> 09:01.416
streaked our gym class.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.210
"He didn't see

09:01.458 --> 09:03.210
the volleyball net,

09:03.251 --> 09:05.586
"and they ended up carrying him

09:03.251 --> 09:05.586
off in a stretcher.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.630
"And then, at lunch,

09:05.628 --> 09:07.630
"this other guy...

09:07.672 --> 09:09.799
Excuse me.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.510
You want to pick that up?

09:11.551 --> 09:12.593
Why should I?

09:12.635 --> 09:13.845
Because it's trash.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.596
Or are you one

09:13.887 --> 09:15.596
of those charming people

09:15.638 --> 09:18.225
who thinks that's just someone

09:15.638 --> 09:18.225
else's responsibility?

09:18.266 --> 09:20.601
That the rest of us

09:18.266 --> 09:20.601
should follow you

09:18.266 --> 09:20.601
around your whole life

09:20.643 --> 09:22.645
and clean up all the little

09:20.643 --> 09:22.645
messes you leave behind?

09:22.687 --> 09:24.647
Let me ask you a question.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.566
Were you, like, born 45?

09:27.817 --> 09:30.611
People like you are the reason

09:27.817 --> 09:30.611
I am moving

09:30.653 --> 09:32.947
to Paris the

09:30.653 --> 09:32.947
second I graduate!

09:38.578 --> 09:39.871
Oh, my God!

09:39.913 --> 09:42.123
This girl rocks.

09:42.165 --> 09:46.169
When I tell you to pick

09:42.165 --> 09:46.169
something up, pick it up!

09:49.672 --> 09:51.632
ABE:

09:49.672 --> 09:51.632
I don't know what to do.

09:51.674 --> 09:52.926
Stevie's

09:51.674 --> 09:52.926
just devastated.

09:51.674 --> 09:52.926
Mm-hmm.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.636
I try to talk to him,

09:52.967 --> 09:55.636
but he just shuts me out.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.847
Well, he'll come around.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.847
You'll see, Abe.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.016
Everything will be fine.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.016
Now, come on.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.018
You don't want to be

10:00.058 --> 10:02.018
late for your meeting.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.937
I don't know

10:02.060 --> 10:03.937
what's happening with Jamie.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.730
We're going through

10:03.978 --> 10:05.730
all this baby food,

10:05.772 --> 10:07.482
and he still

10:05.772 --> 10:07.482
always wants to nurse.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.691
Honey, not now.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.277
I'm dealing with a

10:08.733 --> 10:10.277
family thing here.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.652
Now, if you get

10:10.318 --> 10:11.652
a little weepy

10:11.694 --> 10:13.238
during your presentation,

10:11.694 --> 10:13.238
do what I do:

10:13.280 --> 10:15.115
spill coffee on yourself

10:13.280 --> 10:15.115
and leave the room.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.991
You're too good to me.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.079
Hal, what exactly

10:18.701 --> 10:21.079
are you doing with Abe?

10:21.121 --> 10:22.663
I've seen you pulling

10:21.121 --> 10:22.663
the yarn balls

10:22.705 --> 10:23.957
off his sweater,

10:22.705 --> 10:23.957
and yesterday,

10:23.998 --> 10:25.666
you were

10:23.998 --> 10:25.666
massaging his feet.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.751
I know he means

10:25.708 --> 10:26.751
a lot to you,

10:26.793 --> 10:28.669
but you can't

10:26.793 --> 10:28.669
replace Kitty.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.671
That's ridiculous, Lois.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.091
I'm just being a good friend.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.635
You matter.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.726
Francis?

10:43.768 --> 10:45.686
Yes?

10:45.728 --> 10:48.482
You haven't taken care

10:45.728 --> 10:48.482
of Paint Can yet, have you?

10:48.523 --> 10:50.317
What kind of a

10:48.523 --> 10:50.317
question is that?

10:50.358 --> 10:52.068
If I had, would I be

10:50.358 --> 10:52.068
hiding from you?

10:52.110 --> 10:53.694
It's all right, Francis.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.905
It's unfair of me

10:53.736 --> 10:55.905
to put this burden on you.

10:55.947 --> 10:57.698
We will do this

10:55.947 --> 10:57.698
thing together.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.785
Just think.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.785
We will be sending her

11:00.827 --> 11:02.162
to a much better place,

11:02.203 --> 11:05.165
with open fields

11:02.203 --> 11:05.165
and cool mountain springs

11:05.206 --> 11:06.625
where she can

11:05.206 --> 11:06.625
run all day,

11:06.666 --> 11:09.127
and horses ride people.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.505
Unless, of course,

11:09.169 --> 11:11.505
she's been a bad horse.

11:11.546 --> 11:14.549
Then she will have to spend

11:11.546 --> 11:14.549
eternity in a lake of fire,

11:14.591 --> 11:17.218
with a delicious bale of hay

11:14.591 --> 11:17.218
just out of reach.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.638
Otto, I've never killed anything

11:17.260 --> 11:19.638
bigger than a poodle.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.181
And that was a total accident.

11:21.222 --> 11:24.934
Francis, as hard as it will be,

11:21.222 --> 11:24.934
I know we can do this.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.562
No one said

11:24.976 --> 11:27.562
the cowboy life was easy.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.358
I'll meet you here

11:28.771 --> 11:31.358
at 5:00, after yoga.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.989
Stevie, what

11:36.029 --> 11:37.989
are you doing?

11:38.031 --> 11:40.408
I've seen you do wheelies

11:38.031 --> 11:40.408
up and down this ramp.

11:40.450 --> 11:44.579
Why don't you find yourself

11:40.450 --> 11:44.579
another project?

11:44.621 --> 11:47.248
Lloyd looks happy.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.042
Why don't you destroy

11:47.290 --> 11:49.042
his  family?

11:49.083 --> 11:51.545
Stevie, I know what your

11:49.083 --> 11:51.545
mom did was horrible,

11:51.586 --> 11:53.754
but you've got to stop

11:51.586 --> 11:53.754
feeling sorry for yourself.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.465
Get mad.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.925
That's what I would do if

11:55.507 --> 11:57.925
my mom walked out on me.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.802
Okay, not  my  mom.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.763
But the point is, you have

11:59.844 --> 12:02.763
every right to be angry.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.016
You're right.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.852
That's exactly what

12:05.058 --> 12:07.852
I needed to hear.

12:07.894 --> 12:08.853
Thanks very much.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.313
There you go.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.608
This thing sucks at sarcasm.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.569
Fine.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.238
"My mommy left me, and now

12:15.610 --> 12:18.238
I'm a helpless baby."

12:18.279 --> 12:20.198
Well, I'm not going to let

12:18.279 --> 12:20.198
you just sit there

12:20.240 --> 12:21.575
and feel sorry for yourself.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.784
Think fast.

12:23.826 --> 12:26.079
Come on, you're not

12:23.826 --> 12:26.079
that big of a wuss.

12:26.120 --> 12:30.083
You are not in charge

12:26.120 --> 12:30.083
of how big a wuss I am.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.750
I know you can use your arms.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.750
Catch it!

12:33.294 --> 12:35.505
Look at the helpless

12:33.294 --> 12:35.505
little boy in the wheelchair.

12:35.547 --> 12:36.715
Look at the

12:35.547 --> 12:36.715
little cripple.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.049
Are you going to cry?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.051
Are you going to cry,

12:38.091 --> 12:40.051
little cripple boy?

12:40.093 --> 12:42.220
Ooh, it's a baby

12:40.093 --> 12:42.220
in a wheelchair.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.055
I might be going down

12:42.262 --> 12:44.055
a bad road here,

12:44.097 --> 12:45.806
but if I stop

12:44.097 --> 12:45.806
before I make my point,

12:45.848 --> 12:47.642
this could look kind of bad.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.311
(Malcolm mock-crying)

12:50.353 --> 12:51.812
MALCOLM:

12:50.353 --> 12:51.812
"I'm a little baby.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.314
"I can't move my legs.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.314
Kick his ass.

12:53.356 --> 12:54.524
Where's my mommy?"

12:59.862 --> 13:01.740
Well, this is interesting.

13:01.780 --> 13:04.451
I now officially qualify

13:01.780 --> 13:04.451
for wheelchair basketball.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.536
Never help anyone.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.164
You've never been in love,

13:08.580 --> 13:10.164
have you?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.335
LOIS:

13:12.875 --> 13:14.335
October 12.

13:14.377 --> 13:17.213
At lunch, J.J.

13:14.377 --> 13:17.213
was telling my fortune.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.758
Wow, "girl" again.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.842
I keep telling you,

13:19.798 --> 13:21.842
I'm only going to have girls.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.637
That's if I have kids at all.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.138
I mean, the whole

13:23.678 --> 13:25.138
suburban mom thing

13:25.179 --> 13:26.723
seems like such a nightmare.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.100
Who is that?

13:30.059 --> 13:31.852
I don't know.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.354
But he's getting to second base,

13:33.396 --> 13:34.897
if I have

13:33.396 --> 13:34.897
anything to say about it.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.775
Whoa.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.859
I just have to figure out

13:36.815 --> 13:38.859
a way to get him to notice me.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.779
I don't think you have

13:38.901 --> 13:40.779
to worry about that.

13:40.819 --> 13:41.780
What do you mean?

13:41.820 --> 13:43.864
Well, you know,

13:43.906 --> 13:45.742
he'll probably

13:43.906 --> 13:45.742
do something you don't like,

13:45.784 --> 13:47.702
and you'll unload on him.

13:47.744 --> 13:48.869
What?!

13:48.911 --> 13:50.871
I don't unload on people.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.082
Honey, I hate to be the one

13:50.913 --> 13:53.082
to tell you this,

13:53.124 --> 13:57.920
but the truth is,

13:53.124 --> 13:57.920
everyone calls you "The Mouth."

13:57.962 --> 13:59.798
The Mouth?

13:59.838 --> 14:01.882
Yeah, but they're just

13:59.838 --> 14:01.882
a bunch of immature jerks.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.010
And the principal,

14:01.924 --> 14:04.010
he's just trying to fit in.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.522
Abe, you're not getting the flu.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.064
It's just your allergies.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.317
Did you take your spray?

14:19.359 --> 14:20.901
Look in your vest pocket.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.320
Uh-huh.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.904
What am I going

14:22.362 --> 14:23.904
to do with you?

14:23.946 --> 14:25.906
Can you pat my back?

14:25.948 --> 14:27.325
(burps)

14:27.367 --> 14:28.535
Thanks.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.077
FRANCIS:

14:28.576 --> 14:30.077
Here you go, Paint Can.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.913
Got you the biggest,

14:30.119 --> 14:32.913
nicest carrot I could find.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.915
Please, Francis,

14:32.955 --> 14:34.915
let us not drag this out

14:34.957 --> 14:36.209
any longer

14:34.957 --> 14:36.209
than we have to.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.295
Okay, let's just do it.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.631
(whimpering)

14:43.966 --> 14:45.218
Don't worry, Paint Can.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.927
It will all

14:45.259 --> 14:46.927
be over soon.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.930
One quick pull of the trigger,

14:49.972 --> 14:51.307
and we will

14:49.972 --> 14:51.307
put an end

14:51.349 --> 14:52.851
to her misery.

14:53.976 --> 14:54.935
(sniffles)

14:54.977 --> 14:56.020
Ready...

14:57.146 --> 14:58.939
aim...

14:58.981 --> 15:01.359
fire!

15:01.401 --> 15:02.569
Why didn't you shoot?

15:02.610 --> 15:03.944
Well, you didn't shoot, either.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.112
I wasn't ready.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.531
I'm ready now.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.115
Good. Here we go.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.115
Ready...

15:08.157 --> 15:09.784
aim...

15:09.826 --> 15:11.745
fire!

15:11.786 --> 15:13.788
Oh, come on, Francis,

15:11.786 --> 15:13.788
you're being a coward.

15:13.830 --> 15:14.873
Me?

15:13.830 --> 15:14.873
You totally chickened out.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.541
All right.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.751
One the count

15:16.583 --> 15:17.751
of three,

15:17.792 --> 15:20.754
we both shoot, no matter what.

15:20.795 --> 15:21.962
One...

15:22.004 --> 15:23.297
two...

15:24.173 --> 15:25.049
BOTH:

15:24.173 --> 15:25.049
Bang!

15:25.091 --> 15:26.050
Oh...

15:25.091 --> 15:26.050
Come on.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.134
If you're not...

15:27.176 --> 15:28.845
(both scream)

15:28.887 --> 15:30.597
You could have killed me.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.597
Only after you killed me.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.972
You cannot kill a horse,

15:30.638 --> 15:31.972
What's wrong with you?

15:32.014 --> 15:32.973
but you have no problem

15:32.014 --> 15:32.973
killing Otto.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.225
(thud)

15:34.267 --> 15:35.935
Paint Can?

15:38.730 --> 15:40.440
What's the matter with her?

15:40.481 --> 15:44.444
I think she choked

15:40.481 --> 15:44.444
on the carrot.

15:44.485 --> 15:47.781
Well, I guess

15:44.485 --> 15:47.781
no one can say

15:47.822 --> 15:49.490
we're not real

15:47.822 --> 15:49.490
ranchers now.

15:49.532 --> 15:50.700
Yeah.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.786
I just hope

15:50.742 --> 15:52.786
we don't develop

15:52.827 --> 15:55.580
too much of a taste

15:52.827 --> 15:55.580
for killing.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.997
HAL:

15:55.622 --> 15:56.997
I've been thinking about

15:57.039 --> 15:58.999
picking up Stevie

15:57.039 --> 15:58.999
some of those baggy pants

15:59.041 --> 16:00.167
he's been wanting.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.377
Hal, we've been

16:00.209 --> 16:01.377
through this.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.003
All the kids

16:01.419 --> 16:03.003
are wearing them.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.589
It's not like

16:03.045 --> 16:04.589
he's joining a gang.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.924
Well, maybe you're right.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.592
You do know best

16:05.965 --> 16:07.592
about these things.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.009
He's lucky to

16:07.634 --> 16:09.009
have you, Hal.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.887
Can I get you anything

16:09.051 --> 16:10.887
from the kitchen?

16:10.929 --> 16:12.012
No, I'm fine.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.264
Thanks, honey.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.183
Abe?

16:16.225 --> 16:18.269
Huh?

16:18.311 --> 16:20.313
You just tried

16:18.311 --> 16:20.313
to kiss me.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.606
No.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.442
No, that was

16:21.648 --> 16:24.442
a lip twitch.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.611
See? There it goes again.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.737
You know what?

16:27.779 --> 16:29.029
I'm glad this happened.

16:29.071 --> 16:32.032
Because it made me

16:29.071 --> 16:32.032
realize something.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.033
Get out.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.034
What?

16:34.076 --> 16:35.703
I can't replace Kitty.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.831
And I'm not doing you

16:35.745 --> 16:37.831
any favors by trying.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.916
But what am I supposed

16:37.872 --> 16:39.916
to do without you?

16:39.958 --> 16:42.209
What am I supposed

16:39.958 --> 16:42.209
to do about Stevie?

16:42.251 --> 16:44.044
I don't have

16:42.251 --> 16:44.044
the slightest idea.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.839
But you're his father.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.047
So just get in there.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.425
I know you'll be able

16:47.089 --> 16:49.425
to figure it out.

16:49.467 --> 16:50.969
You can do this.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.304
Now, go.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.305
All right.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.515
Hold on.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.019
Okay.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.230
Mom,

17:03.272 --> 17:04.941
I have a proposal for you.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.651
Now, before you start

17:04.983 --> 17:06.651
poking holes in it,

17:06.693 --> 17:08.110
I'd like you to hear me out.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.112
All I want is

17:08.152 --> 17:10.112
no more school

17:10.154 --> 17:12.072
and no more big boy clothes.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.158
I'd liked to be bathed

17:12.114 --> 17:14.158
and rocked before I go to sleep

17:14.200 --> 17:15.910
and have all my

17:14.200 --> 17:15.910
food mashed up.

17:15.952 --> 17:18.078
In return,

17:15.952 --> 17:18.078
I'll be adorable and...

17:18.120 --> 17:20.080
Are you wearing a diaper?

17:20.122 --> 17:22.959
I want you to know

17:20.122 --> 17:22.959
my level of commitment.

17:26.504 --> 17:29.382
LOIS:

17:26.504 --> 17:29.382
Oh, my God!

17:29.423 --> 17:31.009
Stevie!

17:31.050 --> 17:34.012
Stevie, where are you, son?

17:31.050 --> 17:34.012
I want to...

17:38.307 --> 17:39.266
Come on.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.935
For God's sake, son,

17:40.977 --> 17:42.687
what are you

17:40.977 --> 17:42.687
doing out here?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.104
You're soaking wet.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.692
At last you tell me the truth

17:44.146 --> 17:47.692
about something.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.403
Son, I know you've

17:47.734 --> 17:50.403
had a terrible shock,

17:50.444 --> 17:52.780
and you need your father

17:50.444 --> 17:52.780
to get you through this.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.616
Well, that's not

17:54.156 --> 17:55.616
going to happen

17:55.658 --> 17:58.661
because your daddy

17:55.658 --> 17:58.661
is a weak, weak man.

18:01.455 --> 18:05.334
Son, what your mother

18:01.455 --> 18:05.334
did to you was horrible.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.962
And what I did to you

18:05.376 --> 18:07.962
wasn't any better.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.547
I'm sorry.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.132
Keep going.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.218
Stevie, I know

18:12.174 --> 18:14.218
your whole life

18:14.260 --> 18:17.013
you've had to face

18:14.260 --> 18:17.013
tremendous adversity.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.138
You've shown more courage

18:18.180 --> 18:21.141
than I've had any

18:18.180 --> 18:21.141
right to expect.

18:21.183 --> 18:24.103
And now you're going to

18:21.183 --> 18:24.103
have to show even more.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.065
I know it's not fair,

18:27.147 --> 18:29.233
but believe me,

18:27.147 --> 18:29.233
you can do this.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.152
I've learned to be amazed

18:29.275 --> 18:32.152
when it comes to you.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.155
And if it helps, I promise

18:32.194 --> 18:35.155
I'll always be there.

18:35.197 --> 18:41.412
Frightened and full

18:35.197 --> 18:41.412
of denial, but there.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.420
Let's go... home.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.634
I'll catch...

18:53.049 --> 18:54.634
I didn't mean to!

18:54.675 --> 18:56.176
You better...

18:54.675 --> 18:56.176
It was a joke!

18:56.218 --> 18:58.345
You're making it

18:56.218 --> 18:58.345
worse!

18:56.218 --> 18:58.345
I'm a big boy!

18:58.387 --> 19:00.222
Okay, you drive to the hoop.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.182
When they double-team you,

19:00.264 --> 19:02.182
kick it out to me,

19:02.224 --> 19:03.183
and I'll take the shot.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.186
I'll... take the shot.

19:06.228 --> 19:10.190
I don't... have a mom.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.651
Okay, that's

19:10.232 --> 19:11.651
the third time today

19:11.692 --> 19:12.902
you've played

19:11.692 --> 19:12.902
the "mom card."

19:12.944 --> 19:15.905
Get... used to it.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.198
Hey, jackass,

19:18.240 --> 19:19.993
think it's a big joke

19:18.240 --> 19:19.993
to be in a wheelchair?

19:20.034 --> 19:21.285
No, no, no, this

19:20.034 --> 19:21.285
is real, you know.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.829
I was in a... oh!

19:22.870 --> 19:24.455
(groans)

19:24.497 --> 19:26.499
Ow! Oh!

19:26.540 --> 19:29.251
(groaning)

19:30.670 --> 19:32.296
LOIS:

19:30.670 --> 19:32.296
October 17.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.215
I kept my mouth shut

19:32.338 --> 19:35.215
around Jason for a whole week,

19:35.257 --> 19:37.635
and he asked me out.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.220
I will never go back

19:37.677 --> 19:40.220
to the old me.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.220
No!

19:40.262 --> 19:41.681
Something wrong?

19:41.722 --> 19:43.016
Do you think it's right

19:43.057 --> 19:44.391
to totally change

19:43.057 --> 19:44.391
who you are

19:44.433 --> 19:46.310
and turn your back

19:44.433 --> 19:46.310
on everything you believe in

19:46.352 --> 19:48.646
just to impress a hot guy?

19:50.314 --> 19:51.941
Burt Reynolds hot or Sting hot?

19:51.983 --> 19:53.109
Forget it.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.236
JASON:  So then we put in

19:54.527 --> 19:56.236
dual exhaust,

19:56.278 --> 19:58.238
and now the thing

19:56.278 --> 19:58.238
just flies.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.908
I got it up to 130 miles

19:58.280 --> 20:00.908
an hour last night.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.242
Mm-hmm.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.452
I like talking to you.

20:03.494 --> 20:04.954
You're a good listener.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.247
So we're all going

20:04.996 --> 20:07.247
to ditch class on Friday.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.667
Dave's dad is out of town.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.669
We're going to borrow

20:09.709 --> 20:11.669
his speedboat.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.464
So do you want to?

20:15.506 --> 20:17.257
Okay, that's got to stop.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.257
Huh?

20:17.299 --> 20:19.259
I'm trying to be nice

20:17.299 --> 20:19.259
and not criticize,

20:19.301 --> 20:20.928
but I just have

20:19.301 --> 20:20.928
to say that

20:20.970 --> 20:24.264
that is the most filthy,

20:20.970 --> 20:24.264
disgusting habit I've ever seen.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.266
Yes! That's my girl.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.768
Someone's gonna

20:26.308 --> 20:27.768
lean against that

20:27.810 --> 20:30.146
and get it stuck to

20:27.810 --> 20:30.146
their clothes, but do you care?

20:30.188 --> 20:31.939
No, because you're nothing

20:30.188 --> 20:31.939
but a self-absorbed,

20:31.981 --> 20:34.692
inconsiderate slob.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.276
I'm sorry.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.654
Wow.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.448
I love how you're so passionate

20:38.696 --> 20:41.448
about ecology and stuff.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.491
Really?

20:42.533 --> 20:43.492
Yeah.

20:43.534 --> 20:44.702
It's cool.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.288
I could hardly breathe.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.250
I knew he was going to kiss me.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.301
You are so hot.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.845
So are you.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.099
LOIS:

21:04.388 --> 21:06.099
Reese!

21:06.140 --> 21:09.309
I thought I told you

21:06.140 --> 21:09.309
to take out the...

21:09.351 --> 21:11.020
What are you doing

21:09.351 --> 21:11.020
with my old diary?

21:15.357 --> 21:17.526
(screaming)

21:17.568 --> 21:19.278
(scream echoing)
