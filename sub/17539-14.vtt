00:17.434 --> 00:20.020
Normally I prefer
more of a cramped,

00:20.020 --> 00:21.146
lamp‐shaped environment,

00:21.146 --> 00:23.065
but this place
is also a fav.

00:23.065 --> 00:24.107
Oh, thanks.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.567
Wicked dress!

00:25.567 --> 00:27.486
You're gonna look
so great tonight.

00:27.486 --> 00:28.779
Oh, so are you.

00:28.779 --> 00:31.073
I'm sure your dress
will be amazing.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.824
This is my dress.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.409
Ally:
I know...
(nervous laugh)

00:34.409 --> 00:37.454
‐and I love it!
‐(Jordan whispers) Nice one.

00:37.454 --> 00:40.207
She totally didn't get
that you don't love it.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.376
Has anyone ever told you that
you're a really bad whisperer?

00:42.376 --> 00:43.794
(Jordan whispers) No.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.712
They totally haven't.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.964
‐(door opens)
‐Audrey: Guys! Guys!

00:46.964 --> 00:48.298
Emergency!

00:48.298 --> 00:49.424
Is someone hurt?

00:49.424 --> 00:52.010
‐No.
‐Ooh, is someone really hurt?

00:52.010 --> 00:53.345
‐No!
‐Freddie: Oh.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.806
My web series broke
one million subscribers?

00:55.806 --> 00:57.432
How would that be an emergency?

00:57.432 --> 00:58.934
Oh, is there an emergency?

00:58.934 --> 01:01.436
‐Somebody stole my dress!
‐Evie: It's okay.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.689
Everyone just calm down.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.941
This is why I always bring
a back‐up gown.

01:05.941 --> 01:08.110
‐And back‐up accessories!
‐Audrey: Hm...

01:08.110 --> 01:11.280
do you have anything
a little less...
puncture prone?

01:11.280 --> 01:14.157
Evie:
And back up de‐accessories!

01:14.157 --> 01:16.952
You know, for a VK look,
it's actually pretty cute.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.287
‐I'm sold!
‐(dress rustles)

01:18.287 --> 01:19.580
Ta‐dah!

01:19.580 --> 01:22.082
Wow, how did you
change so fast?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.501
Evie:
Seriously, one second,
you were in one dress,

01:24.501 --> 01:25.669
and then you were
in the other.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.838
It was like right out
of a cartoon.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.506
My mom was raised by fairies.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.592
Quick outfit changes
is a family skill.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.510
When I was a baby,
I could change my own diaper

01:33.510 --> 01:35.137
in two seconds flat.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.888
Thank you for that visual.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.016
Thank you, Evie.
You're a lifesaver.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.852
‐Oh, I've been called worse.
‐Jane: Aww.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.979
Both:
That's so sweet.

01:43.979 --> 01:46.315
This deserves a celebration!

01:46.315 --> 01:47.858
(giggles)
Tea me!

01:52.571 --> 01:53.613
Oh!

01:53.613 --> 01:55.574
Oh, my dress!

01:55.574 --> 01:56.992
Don't look at me.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.036
I'm not the one that always
makes a mess of everything.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.121
You. You did this!

02:01.121 --> 02:03.498
What? No! Of course not.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.959
Why would I do that?
I‐‐ I love your dress.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.919
Huh, that's why
you destroyed it.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.338
You're jealous.

02:09.338 --> 02:12.633
You VKs can't stand it if
someone looks better than you.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.093
‐She has a point.
‐No, she doesn't.

02:15.093 --> 02:18.221
Ally, I swear,
I didn't do this.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.556
But I promise,
I can fix it.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.933
I think.
(nervous chuckle)

02:21.933 --> 02:25.062
Dress, dress,
away from this mess,

02:25.062 --> 02:28.940
rid this gown
of its distress.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.276
‐(gasps)
‐Okay, don't freak out!

02:31.276 --> 02:32.319
Yet.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.572
Dress, dress,
I must express,

02:35.572 --> 02:39.576
make this gown
a fit to impress!

02:39.576 --> 02:41.620
‐(both gasp)
‐Freddie: Wait.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.705
I actually really like it.

02:43.705 --> 02:44.873
You do?

02:44.873 --> 02:47.209
(scoffs)
You're just saying that.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.503
No, I mean it.
It's really... alternative.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.171
Alternative to what?

02:51.171 --> 02:53.715
She means it's
very fashion forward.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.218
If I didn't think I was
already wearing the best dress,

02:56.218 --> 02:57.886
I'd be super jelly.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.888
But I do, so I'm not.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.848
You know what?
I think it's cool too!

03:01.848 --> 03:03.433
Really?

03:03.433 --> 03:05.519
Even the Queen of Hearts herself
would be jealous of that number!

03:05.519 --> 03:08.146
I would totally feature that
on my web show.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.273
"VK gone viral!"

03:10.273 --> 03:12.901
‐It is kind of funky...
‐Mal: Oh, yeah.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.361
Funky.
(nervous laugh)

03:14.361 --> 03:16.530
That's what I was going for,
you know, 'cause that's why

03:16.530 --> 03:18.198
they call me the Funkmaster,

03:18.198 --> 03:20.659
the Funkmonk of Funkytown.

03:20.659 --> 03:21.785
Quit while you're ahead.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.245
‐Good call.
‐(Ally giggles)

03:23.245 --> 03:24.955
Well, I guess the roses aren't

03:24.955 --> 03:26.456
the only thing
being painted red!

03:26.456 --> 03:28.208
I'll take it!

03:28.208 --> 03:29.501
Hm...

03:29.501 --> 03:31.962
"VKs gone viral"?

03:31.962 --> 03:34.214
Isn't it interesting that
we both ended up

03:34.214 --> 03:36.591
with a little villain edge
for our party look?

03:36.591 --> 03:39.302
Maybe a little too interesting.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.057
(phone camera clicks)
