00:04.700 --> 00:06.290
oh! Brain freeze!

00:06.300 --> 00:07.590
Brain freeze!

00:08.500 --> 00:09.990
Hang in there.It'll pass.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.490
Going... going...

00:12.700 --> 00:13.890
going...

00:13.900 --> 00:16.090
okay, okay, I'm good.

00:18.100 --> 00:21.190
Oh! Brain freeze!Brain freeze!

00:21.200 --> 00:25.590
I don't think "brain freeze"
is an accurate description here.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.890
Oh, geez.It's mom.

00:30.800 --> 00:31.590
Aw, great.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.090
Who's that she's with?

00:34.400 --> 00:36.590
I don't know,
but they haven't been dating long.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.790
- How can you tell?
- He's still smiling.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.890
All right, let's get out of here
before she sees us.

00:41.900 --> 00:43.290
How? They're standing
in front of the door.

00:43.300 --> 00:45.390
We'll go out the back.

00:45.900 --> 00:46.790
Hey, look.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.090
I'm a rabid dog.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.490
- aw, damn it!
- Plan b?

00:55.400 --> 00:56.390
Bathroom.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.490
- But I don't have to pee!
- Go, go!

01:02.300 --> 01:04.489
Now what, we just wait here
until they leave?

01:04.500 --> 01:07.990
Would you rather go out there
and chat with mom and her new boyfriend?

01:10.700 --> 01:13.090
Hey, evelyn, get me a muffin, too.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.990
Somebody's drinking more than coffee.

01:23.100 --> 01:24.590
Gonna be long?

01:24.600 --> 01:26.590
I don't know.

01:41.700 --> 01:44.490
And bingo was his name-o!

01:48.500 --> 01:50.690
- All yours.
- Thanks.

02:10.100 --> 02:12.390
uh, thanks.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.090
So, listen, when you guys are
done screwing around in here,

02:21.100 --> 02:23.990
your mother would like to talk to you.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.390
Can I come out now?

02:54.700 --> 02:55.890
Hey!

02:55.900 --> 02:57.290
Look who's here!

02:57.300 --> 02:58.590
It's mom. Hey, mom.

02:58.600 --> 02:59.990
Oh, stop it, both of you.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.690
I can't believe
I'm such a horrible person,

03:01.700 --> 03:03.290
you have to hide from me in public.

03:03.300 --> 03:04.190
We weren't hiding.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.890
Which does not invalidate your premise.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.690
jake had, uh,had stomach problems.

03:10.700 --> 03:12.490
Don't put this on me.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.990
I apologize for my children.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.490
Oh, no problem.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.790
- Teddy leopold.
- Oh, hi. Uh, alan.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.590
This is my brother,my son jake.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.990
How you doing?

03:23.000 --> 03:26.190
Evelyn's told me a lot of
wonderful things about you boys.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.090
Not buying it, huh?

03:31.900 --> 03:33.690
I tried.

03:33.700 --> 03:36.790
Teddy lives in denver,but he does a lot
of business in L.A.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.590
So I helped him find a little pied--terre
in century city.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.190
What's a pied--terre?

03:41.400 --> 03:44.890
It's french for"a place to play
hanky-panky with grandma."

03:45.700 --> 03:46.990
- Mom!
- Mom!

03:47.400 --> 03:50.090
Oh, relax.It's not gonna scar him.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.090
Yeah, but what about us?

03:53.200 --> 03:54.690
Well, anyway, it was nice meeting you.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.590
We got to bring the kid
back to his mother'S.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.590
Again, you're putting it on me?

03:59.800 --> 04:01.190
Nice to meet you, too.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.590
Yeah. Bye-bye.See you, mom.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.290
- Bye, mom.
- Bye.

04:05.700 --> 04:06.990
Wait, I have to pee.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.990
You've peed enough.

04:19.399 --> 04:20.790
"teddy leopold."

04:20.800 --> 04:22.190
Do we know a teddy leopold?

04:22.200 --> 04:23.690
That's mom's new boyfriend.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.790
Oh, right, of course.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.890
aren't you curious why he's calling?

04:30.900 --> 04:32.590
not particularly.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.490
What if something happened to mom?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.490
Then we'll just wait for
dorothy to bring us the broom.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.590
Give me the phone.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.890
Hello?

04:45.400 --> 04:46.990
no, no, this is alan.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.690
Hi, teddy. What's up?

04:53.600 --> 04:55.590
That is, uh,that is quite an offer

04:55.900 --> 04:57.190
I-I'd love to.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.390
Hang on, I'll ask him.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.090
- teddy has invited us...
- I'm busy.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.890
- Do you at least want to hear what it is?
- Nope.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.490
Charlie can't make it,
but can you still take me?

05:09.700 --> 05:11.990
Really? Gee, thanks.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.690
I'll, uh,guess I'll see you then.

05:22.300 --> 05:24.490
You're gonna be sorry.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.790
You're gonna be homeless.

05:29.100 --> 05:31.190
Why do you always have to play that card?

05:31.300 --> 05:35.290
Look, alan, I have no interest in hanging
out with mom's boyfriend du jour.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.790
Why not? He seems like a great guy.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.390
He might be the greatest guy in the world,

05:38.400 --> 05:41.990
but he'll end up like every other husband
or boyfriend she's ever had.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.890
Either she'll dump him, he'll dump her,

05:43.900 --> 05:47.090
or he'll die under suspicious circumstances.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.190
No matter what,

05:49.200 --> 05:51.490
you're left standing on the curb
with your fishing pole

05:51.500 --> 05:53.090
on the first day of summer vacation,

05:53.100 --> 05:56.590
waiting for a chrysler lebaron
that never comes!

05:59.300 --> 06:01.590
Okay, this isn't about teddy, is it?

06:02.100 --> 06:05.390
Hey, hey, you want to be buddies
with this guy, go right ahead.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.990
I got better things to do.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.890
Better than ringside seats to the
heavyweight championship fight

06:09.900 --> 06:11.890
at caesar's palace tomorrow night?

06:12.700 --> 06:14.390
What?

06:15.100 --> 06:17.090
Ringside.

06:17.300 --> 06:18.390
Ringside?

06:18.400 --> 06:21.590
Any closer, and we'd be sitting
in the spit bucket.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.790
Should I call him back and tell him
you've changed your mind?

06:26.700 --> 06:27.990
No, no. No.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.690
He's just using us
to get closer to mom.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.290
When we were kids, it was
disneyland and cotton candy.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.390
- Now it's ringside seats.
- And a private plane.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.290
He's got a private plane?

06:38.000 --> 06:41.290
And a limo and a penthouse suite.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.890
- Still not interested?
- Nope.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.390
- Still have better things to do?
- Yep.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.390
Do you realize what a stubborn child
you sound like?

06:51.400 --> 06:52.990
I do.

06:53.000 --> 06:53.990
You're not gonna give it up, are ya?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.990
Not a chance.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.290
Okay, then...

06:57.600 --> 06:58.790
good night.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.690
Good night.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.090
Oh, boy!Teddy's here!

07:19.400 --> 07:21.190
Charlie, teddy's here!

07:21.300 --> 07:23.190
Oh, boy.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.290
Hi, al. You all packed?

07:27.300 --> 07:29.090
are you kidding?I packed last night.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.990
I was too excited to sleep.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.990
Terrific.Where's charlie?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.390
out on the deck.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.290
Give me a minute.I want to say hi.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.390
- Can I go sit in the limo?
- Knock yourself out.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.990
There's sushi.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.190
Sushi in a car! Oh, boy!

07:50.200 --> 07:51.990
This is your other plans?

07:52.800 --> 07:53.990
Not all of 'em.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.190
Later I'm gonna go inside and watch some
girl-on-girl porn.

07:57.900 --> 07:59.990
Beautiful.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.690
Look, I still have
an extra ticket to the fight,

08:02.700 --> 08:04.390
and there's plenty of room on the plane.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.790
No, thanks.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.190
Did I do something to tick you off?

08:09.200 --> 08:11.590
You know, aside from
slipping it to your mother.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.790
No, no. It's just I prefer not to get
involved in her personal life.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.890
I'm not asking you to get
involved in her personal life.

08:18.900 --> 08:22.190
I'm asking you to come to vegas
with me and see a fight.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.490
- Yeah, but why?
- I don't know,

08:24.600 --> 08:26.690
you seem like a nice guy.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.290
Don't you have your own friends?

08:28.300 --> 08:30.190
Charlie,when you get to be my age,

08:30.200 --> 08:33.090
most of your friends
are either married or dead.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.190
What's the difference?

08:35.299 --> 08:37.890
The dead ones smell up my plane.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.990
Come on, throw some clothes on,
and let's go have some fun.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.590
what the hell.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.290
Just do me a favor.

08:50.300 --> 08:51.990
Let's keep this between us.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.790
I want your mother to think
that I went on a business trip.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.890
No problem.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.890
My mother still thinks I went to college.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.690
Beautiful.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.390
hey, charlie,you need anything?

09:11.600 --> 09:15.690
Teddy, if I was any happier,
my pts would be wet.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.290
Hey, teddy, uh, can we get
some gelato after the fight?

09:19.300 --> 09:20.490
Anything you want, kid.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.790
Gee, thanks.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.190
Hiya.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.090
What's up?

09:32.800 --> 09:33.690
You know, I've, uh,

09:33.700 --> 09:36.890
I've never really been a big fan of the
pugilistic arts, but...

09:37.100 --> 09:37.990
I have to admit,

09:38.000 --> 09:41.990
I'm getting kind of swept away in the
pageantry of the event.

09:46.100 --> 09:48.090
I like your bling very much.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.590
I, uh, I tried to pierce the ear once,

09:50.600 --> 09:53.090
but it got horribly infected.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.490
Hey, uh, uh, you know where we
could score some good gelato?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.190
Nah.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.090
word.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.190
I think that might be
that snoopy fellow.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.890
Terrific.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.290
hello.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.090
Oh, hi, evelyn.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.090
Yeah. How are you, sweetheart?

10:24.200 --> 10:25.690
Good, good.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.290
Where am I?

10:29.700 --> 10:31.590
san francisco.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.690
I'm going into a meeting.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.090
can I call you back?

10:37.100 --> 10:38.390
No shots below the waist.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.690
Love you, too, sweetheart.Bye.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.890
- You're very good.
- Yeah.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.990
I've got five grand on the big russian.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.990
Either of you fellows like
to have a piece of my action?

10:52.400 --> 10:54.590
- I'll take half.
- Attaboy.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.190
How about you, alan?

10:56.500 --> 10:57.790
Oh, what the heck.

10:57.800 --> 11:03.090
I'm in vegas.Put me down for $20,no, $25.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.890
make it $20.

11:13.400 --> 11:17.190
One, two, three,

11:17.200 --> 11:20.190
four, five...

11:20.200 --> 11:22.890
how do you say "get up" in russian?

11:22.900 --> 11:26.590
Seven, eight...

11:26.600 --> 11:28.790
Nine, ten.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.890
Unbelievable,an 18-second fight.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.290
Takes me longer to start peeing.

11:36.500 --> 11:39.590
Yeah, thanks so much for giving me half
your action on the guy.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.390
No problem.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.890
You want the other half?

11:41.900 --> 11:43.390
No, I'm good.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.790
oh, yeah, baby!

11:46.100 --> 11:47.490
20 dead presidents.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.590
I'm even!

11:50.600 --> 11:52.490
Was he a preemie?

11:52.700 --> 11:53.890
Actually, we both were.

11:53.900 --> 11:56.290
Our mom waits nine months for nothing.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.490
Hey, fellas,I want to show you something.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.590
What do you think?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.290
- Nice.
- Yeah. Who's it for?

12:05.600 --> 12:06.690
Your mother.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.790
No, seriously.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.690
I know it's kind of old-fashioned, but, uh,

12:10.700 --> 12:13.590
I wanted to run it by you guys
before I asked her.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.490
Ask her what?

12:15.900 --> 12:17.590
Charlie, I love your mom.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.090
I want to marry her.

12:19.100 --> 12:23.590
But... but... you could
do so much better.

12:23.900 --> 12:26.090
That's no way to talk about your mother.

12:26.300 --> 12:28.490
That's precisely the way
to talk about my mother.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.890
Charlie,be supportive.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.790
I thought I was being supportive.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.490
Regardless of what
you guys think about her,

12:34.500 --> 12:36.290
evelyn is a great broad.

12:36.300 --> 12:39.290
I want to marry her and I would like
your blessing.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.690
You got my blessing, teddy.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.990
Shut up and eat your gelato.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.790
Come on, charlie.Wouldn't it be great
to have a dad again?

12:45.800 --> 12:49.390
I'm a grown man, alan.
I don't need a father anymore.

12:49.900 --> 12:52.090
Would any of you gentleman like a date?

12:52.300 --> 12:53.590
Sorry, doll, I'm taken,

12:53.600 --> 12:56.790
but I wouldn't mind footing the bill
for my two boys here.

12:57.100 --> 12:58.590
Hi, I'm amber.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.390
I'm tiffany.

13:02.900 --> 13:05.190
- Thanks, daddy!
- Thanks, daddy!

13:12.800 --> 13:14.890
- hey.
- Hey.

13:15.700 --> 13:16.790
What are you doing?

13:16.800 --> 13:18.490
Nothing, nothing.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.290
How was work?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.290
You don't care about my work.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.490
- What's under the pillow?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

13:27.000 --> 13:29.190
Modern bride?

13:30.200 --> 13:32.490
I just read it for the articles.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.090
Really?

13:34.400 --> 13:36.890
Okay, I was looking for ideas

13:36.900 --> 13:38.490
because I thought it would be nice

13:38.500 --> 13:42.490
if we had the wedding for teddy and
mom here in the house.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.390
Oh, my god!

13:47.100 --> 13:49.790
You're a mind reader!

13:50.600 --> 13:53.490
I didn't want to bring it up
'cause I was afraid you might say no.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.690
But I was up all night doing research.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.190
Now, I'm thinking a sunset ceremony
with the guests gathered on the beach below

14:00.200 --> 14:04.390
as the bride and groom cross onto the deck
wearing traditional polynesian wedding garb,

14:04.600 --> 14:07.390
surrounded by tropical flowers
and tiki torches.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.590
Okay, what about it don't you like?

14:11.600 --> 14:14.290
'Cause I was a little iffy
on the tiki torches.

14:14.500 --> 14:17.590
You're a little iffy in so many ways.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.790
Okay, we can hammer out the details later.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.290
The thing to remember is that we're
doing this for someone we love.

14:22.300 --> 14:23.290
Right.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.090
- Teddy.
- Teddy.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.990
Okay, I'm out of here.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.890
Her, berta, did you hear
the news about mom?

14:28.900 --> 14:30.490
Yeah, she joined the mormon church

14:30.500 --> 14:33.590
so she can get a rent-controlled
apartment in salt lake city.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.290
Oh, you mean your mom. No.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.790
We're getting a new dad.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.090
He's great. His name is teddy.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.190
He took us to a boxing match.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.890
He bought us prostitutes and gelato.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.590
Well, congratulations.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.390
I'm real happy for you boys.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.790
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.590
I think my news
was far more interesting.

14:54.300 --> 14:55.990
I'm going to call teddy
and tell him our plan.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.690
Oh, great. Ask him how he feels about
tiki torches.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.290
- Hey, teddy,it's charlie.
- And alan!Hi, teddy!

15:05.200 --> 15:07.090
Yeah, alan says hi.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.290
Listen, we've been thinking about
the wedding...

15:09.300 --> 15:11.290
Tiki torches.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.890
- What? You're kidding.
- What?

15:23.400 --> 15:25.390
- I don't believe it.
- What?!

15:25.800 --> 15:27.590
Mom turned him down.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.990
That bitch!

15:30.500 --> 15:32.490
Gee, teddy, I don't know what to say.

15:32.900 --> 15:34.490
I feel terrible.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.190
Well, this doesn't mean we couldn't still
hang out, right?

15:37.900 --> 15:39.090
So you'll call us?

15:39.100 --> 15:41.590
Great, great.Look forward to it.
All right, bye-bye.

15:43.700 --> 15:46.190
I know that tone of voice.
We'll never hear from him.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.590
No tiki torches?

15:49.600 --> 15:52.090
I don't understand.
How could mom say no to him?

15:52.100 --> 15:55.690
- He was perfect for her.
- Forget her.He was perfect for us.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.890
I'm closing the door to my heart, charlie.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.090
It just hurts too much.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.290
Screw it. This isn't over.Come on.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.790
Where are we going?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.390
We are going to talk
some sense into our mother.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.090
Really?

16:11.100 --> 16:13.390
It's hard to imagine
that turning out well.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.890
mom?! Mom, where the hell are you?

16:20.000 --> 16:20.890
Maybe she's not home.

16:20.900 --> 16:23.790
She's home. Her car's in the driveway,
the alarm's not on.

16:23.800 --> 16:24.690
Mom!

16:24.700 --> 16:27.490
Boys, I gave you that key for emergencies,

16:27.500 --> 16:30.090
not to barge in on me like the gestapo.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.590
We want to talk to you about teddy.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.990
Teddy? Why in the world would
you want to talk about teddy?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.890
- Because we love teddy.
- And you broke his heart.

16:40.900 --> 16:41.890
Hang on a second.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.890
You met the man for five minutes
in a coffee shop.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.190
Well, it was a good five minutes.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.890
Evelyn, what the hell's going on?

16:55.900 --> 16:57.690
I'll be right with you, sweetie.

16:57.700 --> 17:00.490
Look, this is not the best time.

17:00.700 --> 17:04.990
Oh, come on, evy,the viagra's starting
to make my ears burn.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.290
Who are these clowns?

17:08.599 --> 17:12.490
hugo, darling,these are my sons,
charlie and alan.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.990
Wait a minute.You didn't tell me
you had any kids.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.990
I sure didn't sign on for any kids.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.390
Just give me a minute, darling.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.190
I'll be right with you.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.390
If I wanted to see any kids,
I'd go visit my own.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.190
How old are these nuts?

17:27.200 --> 17:29.790
From over here,they look about a hundred.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.590
Mom, what about teddy?

17:34.300 --> 17:37.890
Can we please have this conversation
another time?

17:37.900 --> 17:40.090
No, no, no, no.We are having it right now.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.690
What do you want me to say?

17:41.700 --> 17:44.190
Teddy's fine. I like teddy,

17:44.200 --> 17:46.690
but he's ready to settle down and I'm not.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.290
I want my freedom.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.190
Okay, I get freedom,but come on.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.490
Teddy's way better than this guy.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.490
As I said, teddy's fine,

17:55.600 --> 18:01.490
but there are some areas in which he
just doesn't measure up to hugo.

18:05.900 --> 18:07.590
- Oh, mom!
- Oh, mom!

18:09.800 --> 18:12.290
It's the biggest I've ever seen.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.590
Makes it worth eating dinner at 3:30.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.890
But, but, but teddy...

18:18.900 --> 18:20.590
I don't want to hear it.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.090
You have no say in this.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.490
This is my life.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.390
And right now I don't want to be tied down.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.790
I want options.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.690
hugo?

18:35.600 --> 18:36.890
Hugo?

18:39.800 --> 18:41.490
Oh, god, no!O!

18:41.500 --> 18:43.090
Quick, somebody,give me the phone!

18:43.100 --> 18:44.290
Come on!Come on!

18:45.100 --> 18:47.490
- Here, here.
- Oh, god.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.290
Come on. Come on. Come on.

18:51.300 --> 18:53.690
Hello, teddy?

18:57.400 --> 19:01.790
Oh, I'm so glad I caught you in.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.290
I hope you can forgive me,teddy.

19:04.300 --> 19:07.090
I just needed time to think about it.

19:07.100 --> 19:11.090
It's like they say,"you don't know what
you got till it's gone."

19:12.000 --> 19:16.890
Yes,yes, my darling,
I love you, too.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.090
Well, I'll be right over.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.590
could someone please put a sheet over him?

19:30.500 --> 19:32.290
Mom, shouldn't we call 911?

19:32.300 --> 19:35.990
Well, call whoever you want.
The man is dead.

19:36.900 --> 19:39.290
You're really going to leave
and go to teddy's?

19:39.300 --> 19:42.190
Well, I can't very well
invite him over here.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.890
All right! She's going back to teddy!

19:47.900 --> 19:50.690
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,a little respect.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.090
Oh. Oh, yeah.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.590
Okay, who's our daddy?

19:56.800 --> 19:58.390
Teddy!
