Oh, hell no, man.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.538
This is part
of the city program for cops.

00:16.581 --> 00:19.062

some ground rules.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.237
This is our neighborhood.

00:20.281 --> 00:22.152
We belong here.
You don't.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.633
How are you getting home?I was kind of hoping
you might give me a ride.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.548
I don't get in cars
with strangers.

00:26.591 --> 00:29.029

A city is like a person.

00:40.692 --> 00:42.303
If there's
something wrong inside,

00:42.346 --> 00:44.087
you have to figure out
what's causing the problem

00:44.131 --> 00:45.784
and tackle that.Okay, I hear that,

00:45.828 --> 00:47.482
but if you're hurting,
you got to treat the symptoms

00:47.525 --> 00:48.874
while you're working
on the cure, though, right?

00:48.918 --> 00:51.138
100%. I'm not saying
we don't need cops.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.053
But I also believe
in working toward a future

00:53.096 --> 00:55.533
where we don't need
as many of them.So you're trying

00:55.577 --> 00:56.795
to put me out of business?

00:56.839 --> 00:58.754
In an ideal world, yes.

00:58.797 --> 00:59.972
[laughs]

01:00.016 --> 01:01.800
It would give you more time
to cook for me.

01:01.844 --> 01:04.847
You don't ever have to worry
about me making time for that.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.198

us tonight.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.591

How you doing?Good.

01:36.444 --> 01:37.662
You're looking
sharp as ever.

01:37.706 --> 01:39.316
You, too.Listen, I'm...

01:39.360 --> 01:41.449
headed in for dinner
with some girlfriends,

01:41.492 --> 01:44.234

or a drink sometime.

01:44.278 --> 01:46.410
Could be fun.It would be nice
to catch up.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.195
But I should probably mention
I'm seeing someone.

01:48.238 --> 01:50.197
I'm actually with her
right now.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.460
Really? Look at you
getting domestic.

01:54.244 --> 01:56.420
So it's still early days.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.335
Good luck with that.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.949
I'll text you.

I don't have a problem. I'm just
calling it like I see it.

through a divorce,

02:16.962 --> 02:19.487

02:20.488 --> 02:22.272
It was a while ago.

02:22.316 --> 02:23.621
Nightcap?

02:23.665 --> 02:26.146
I could say yes
to a cocktail.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.109
[grunting]Come on, you got it man.
This is good.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.763
All right, give me three more.

02:34.806 --> 02:36.460
Three, two...

02:36.504 --> 02:38.680
Aah! Damn it!

02:38.723 --> 02:41.900
Still not good enough.Dude, that's solid.

02:41.944 --> 02:43.728
I mean, you're at it,
like, every morning

02:43.772 --> 02:44.990
before the sun comes up.

02:45.034 --> 02:47.123
You work out probably more
than anyone I know.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.212
You're, like, twice as strong
as last week.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.562
And half as strong as I was
before getting injured.

02:51.606 --> 02:54.261
I need to be 100% if
I'm gonna pass my PFQ

02:54.304 --> 02:55.392
and get back out
in the field.

02:55.436 --> 02:56.915
But you're making
great progress.

02:56.959 --> 02:59.135
It's one step at a time,
you know.[multiple gunshots]

possible suspects.Suspects?

03:16.152 --> 03:17.719
That's my friend, ese.

03:17.762 --> 03:20.025
We heard shots and came
running, just like you.

03:20.069 --> 03:22.245
He's dead. I checked.

03:22.289 --> 03:25.205
Oh, Benjamin, man.
Marcos, what happened?

03:25.248 --> 03:27.729
This had to be the
Los Diablos Dormidos.Why do you say that?

03:27.772 --> 03:29.034
You see the shooter?No.

But I know it was them.
Probably that Tony guy

give us more.

school; he's hurt nobody.

to let us handle this.

better believe I will.

Yeah, I was, but this
shooting went down

05:13.530 --> 05:15.053
a couple blocks
from my house,

05:15.097 --> 05:18.230
so I'm putting in a request
to increase patrol in the area.

05:18.274 --> 05:19.797
Help keep things
from popping off.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.408
Yeah, I saw that one
come through.

That's a sketchy

Yeah, well, it's also home.

05:24.454 --> 05:26.326
I'm doing my best
to make it less sketchy.

05:26.369 --> 05:28.589
Most cops live as far away
from hot zones as possible.

Why'd you buy a house
in the middle of one?

05:33.376 --> 05:35.770
my pops always told me
to lead by example.

05:35.813 --> 05:38.816

05:41.079 --> 05:42.603
Did you know the victim?A little.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.474
He was friends with some
of the bangers on the block

05:44.518 --> 05:45.823
who want to handle things
their own way.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.085
So added patrol presence

05:47.129 --> 05:48.522
would really help
keep things cool

05:48.565 --> 05:50.045

saturate the area

I-I've got a seminar
that's about to start,

09:23.693 --> 09:25.782

paid good money for this.

with Marcos,

Problem is, we got
no proof either way.

Okay, unless we can pin this on
Tony or prove that he's clean,

11:16.719 --> 11:19.461
Marcos is gonna go straight for
him the second we let him loose.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.724

a little more about the victim.

to the crime somehow though.

to carry out the hit?

It was too sloppy.

A recording device.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.026
Budding filmmaker?

19:18.069 --> 19:19.854
No way. He's been
with me all day.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.421
Do you have any way
of proving that?

19:21.464 --> 19:24.250
I do. Found this recording
equipment hidden in the bedroom.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.034
Camera behind the TV.

19:26.077 --> 19:27.514

19:27.557 --> 19:29.298
Did you know that he was
recording the two of you in bed?

19:29.342 --> 19:30.647
No.

19:30.691 --> 19:32.345
You were taping us?!

And from the little I saw--

19:33.389 --> 19:35.304
and I do mean
little--

19:35.348 --> 19:37.219
I wouldn't be so eager
to broadcast your performance.

Get him out of here.Let's go.

19:40.570 --> 19:42.616
You know
what this means though.Yeah.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.400
If the two of them
were here all day...

19:44.444 --> 19:46.010
We still don't know
who the shooter is.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.366
Hondo, heard you found
something.

19:53.409 --> 19:56.369
Tech ran a search on both
Chad and Dave's computers.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.066
Turns out both these guys

19:58.109 --> 19:59.720
are members
of the same online chat room.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.635
CHRIS:
"Take The Red Pill"?

20:01.678 --> 20:05.856
Yeah, it's a place where men go
to spew crap against women.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.381
Chad and Dave both posted
detailed revenge fantasies

20:08.424 --> 20:09.773
about two of today's victims.

20:09.817 --> 20:11.558
Chad about killing the lawyer
in the first shooting,

20:11.601 --> 20:13.168
Dave about one of the girls
at the sorority house.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.257
But neither of these guys
is our shooter, so...

20:15.301 --> 20:16.867
Seems like someone
read their fantasies

20:16.911 --> 20:18.869
and decided to act them out
on their behalf.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.871
This website's toxic.

20:20.915 --> 20:22.438
CHRIS: If the killer's enacting
men's hate fantasies,

20:22.482 --> 20:25.267
any woman mentioned in the forum
could be a potential target.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.834
Exactly.Also means that our killer's

20:26.877 --> 20:28.314
been hanging out
in this chat room.

20:28.357 --> 20:29.489
How many users
do they have?

20:29.532 --> 20:30.446
Got over 5,000.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.231
All anonymous,
for the moment.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.797
So how do we find
this guy then?

20:33.841 --> 20:36.365
Burrows contacted
the chat room moderator.

20:36.409 --> 20:37.671
They've agreed
to come in for questioning,

20:37.714 --> 20:39.281
hopefully, to help us
narrow down the field.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.501
That's the best we got
right now.

20:41.544 --> 20:43.503
CHRIS:
Hondo.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.244
I want to be there.

Homicide's got the case
until they I.D. a suspect.

20:47.637 --> 20:49.683
As soon as they do, you'll
be the tip of the spear.

20:49.726 --> 20:53.077
Extra set of ears
won't hurt, boss.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.818
Fair enough.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.951
I'll let Burrows know
you want to join him.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.911
[door opens][Luca exhales]

21:04.480 --> 21:07.396
We got evidence placing
Tony across town

21:07.440 --> 21:09.311
at the time your
buddy got hit.

21:09.355 --> 21:11.139
So, looks like
it wasn't him.

21:11.182 --> 21:14.185
You know anyone else who might
have had it out for your boy?

21:16.231 --> 21:18.538
Look, what's your beef with
me, bro? All I'm trying to do

21:18.581 --> 21:20.191
is help solve your
friend's murder.How?

21:20.235 --> 21:21.541
By locking me up?

21:21.584 --> 21:23.325
Actually, yeah.

21:23.369 --> 21:24.979
Okay? Because if I hadn't,
you would've put a hit

21:25.022 --> 21:27.111
on Tony and his crew
based off of nothing.

21:27.155 --> 21:28.548
They would have retaliated.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.332
There'd be more dead
bodies on both sides.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.726
If it wasn't Tony,
who was it, then?That's what I'm asking you, man.

21:32.769 --> 21:34.336
We should be working
together on this.Look,

21:34.380 --> 21:35.816
just because we shook hands
once or twice

21:35.859 --> 21:36.991
don't mean we're a team.

21:37.034 --> 21:38.427
All right.

21:38.471 --> 21:39.428
Well, just 'cause I haven't
run you off the block,

21:39.472 --> 21:41.169
it doesn't mean I'm above it.

21:41.212 --> 21:43.519
You want black-and-whites
outside your door every morning?

21:43.563 --> 21:46.392

time you crank your tunes?

21:53.790 --> 21:55.662

21:55.705 --> 21:57.664
You got a rep to maintain.

21:57.707 --> 22:00.014
Okay, believe it or not,
growing up,

22:00.057 --> 22:01.711
I had a line I had to walk, too.

Man, please.You know what?

22:03.844 --> 22:05.454
I'm third-generation SWAT.
That means

22:05.498 --> 22:07.978
just like you, I had
an image to protect.

22:08.022 --> 22:11.068
I had to watch who I ran with
or my pops would beat my ass.

22:11.112 --> 22:12.983
So why the hell
you living on my block now?

22:13.027 --> 22:14.681

22:15.725 --> 22:17.248
That's funny.

22:17.292 --> 22:20.469
You're the second person
to ask me that today.

22:20.513 --> 22:23.124
I guess I got sick
of letting other people tell me

22:23.167 --> 22:25.474
who I could be friends with.

22:25.518 --> 22:28.477
I thought maybe
I could make a difference.

22:28.521 --> 22:31.480
You know, help keep
people out of jail

22:31.524 --> 22:33.439
instead of waiting
for them to do something

22:33.482 --> 22:36.224
that makes me lock them up.Big of you, man.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.487
But I ain't the type
to buddy up with cops.Look, I'm not looking

22:38.531 --> 22:39.836
for a friendship bracelet.

who killed Benjamin.

Ben-Ben, not Benjamin.

like some kind of punk-ass.

get his attention,

ever did, though.

beefing with someone at work.

from the L-2Ds.

to talk to the girl, right?

providing for our family

to spend much time online.

What is this about, exactly?CHRIS:
You run

24:23.592 --> 24:25.768
a chat room focused on demeaning
and insulting women?

24:25.812 --> 24:27.770
No. I run a chat room
designed to let men

24:27.814 --> 24:30.512
voice frustrations they're not
allowed to voice anywhere else.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.601
Frustrations about women.ANNABETH:
Among other things, yes.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.908
Men have it harder today
than at any point in history.

24:34.951 --> 24:36.083
But society's decided
they're not allowed

24:36.126 --> 24:37.519
to acknowledge that,
let alone complain.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.782
That's why the movement
is so popular.

24:39.826 --> 24:40.696
The movement?

24:40.740 --> 24:42.002
The men's rights movement.

24:42.045 --> 24:44.526
Acknowledges the
discrimination men face today.

24:44.570 --> 24:47.094
Are you serious?Men suffer higher
incarceration rates,

24:47.137 --> 24:49.531
mortality rates, suicide rates.
They're less likely

24:49.575 --> 24:51.228
to win custody of their children
in a divorce.

24:51.272 --> 24:53.927
They're also responsible
for over 90% of violent crimes.

24:53.970 --> 24:57.539
And the majority of the time,
the other victim is a man.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.106
[exhales]

24:59.149 --> 25:00.586
[chuckles]
Well, is this...

25:00.629 --> 25:02.196
is this when you tell me
that I'm suffering

25:02.239 --> 25:04.590
from internalized misogyny?
Because I'm not.

25:04.633 --> 25:05.721
Men are losing jobs

25:05.765 --> 25:07.157
to less qualified
women and minorities

25:07.201 --> 25:08.289
in the name of diversity.

25:08.332 --> 25:10.160
They have a right to
be angry about that.

25:10.204 --> 25:11.422
I don't see
any feminists out there

25:11.466 --> 25:13.424
slaughtering innocent civilians.

25:13.468 --> 25:15.426
I'm not condoning
violence against anyone.

25:15.470 --> 25:17.864
I'm just suggesting that
this push to blur the lines

25:17.907 --> 25:20.431
between the sexes is ripping
our country apart at the seams.

25:20.475 --> 25:21.563
So, yeah.

25:21.607 --> 25:22.956
I'm anti-feminism.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.610
But I'm not anti-women.The men

25:24.653 --> 25:25.872
on your site are.Look,

25:25.915 --> 25:27.134
I don't like everything
that gets posted.

25:27.177 --> 25:29.049
But they're just
blowing off steam.

25:29.092 --> 25:31.268
The First Amendment
grants that right.Someone

25:31.312 --> 25:33.662
from your chat room
murdered five women

25:33.706 --> 25:35.272
in less then 24 hours,
so this is

25:35.316 --> 25:36.970
a little bit more
than just talk.

25:39.276 --> 25:41.191
The shootings today.

25:41.235 --> 25:43.106
Why didn't you say that before?CHRIS:

25:43.150 --> 25:44.760

or not.

25:44.804 --> 25:46.806
What? Of course I'm not.

25:46.849 --> 25:48.285
We think the shooter
frequents your site,

25:48.329 --> 25:50.549
but you've got thousands
of users and years of postings.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.594

to help us narrow the field.

How?Visit the site

25:54.596 --> 25:56.642
and flag
the most aggressive users.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.252
Okay.

26:00.297 --> 26:01.951
Okay.Could take a while.

26:01.995 --> 26:04.388

as we got something to run with.

How'd it go
with that chat room guy?

26:16.879 --> 26:19.055
Turns out the
moderator's a woman.

26:19.099 --> 26:21.667
I can't say we agree on much,
but at least she's willing

26:21.710 --> 26:23.320
to help us zero in
on the suspect.

26:23.364 --> 26:24.321
How's your cheek?

Hey.

26:30.589 --> 26:34.375
I'm sorry if I pushed you
earlier about the interview.

26:34.418 --> 26:37.421
I think that you would be great,
but if you really

26:37.465 --> 26:39.598
don't want to do it,
then I'm gonna drop it.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.644
Can I ask you something?

26:42.688 --> 26:44.298
Sure.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.300
Why did you become a cop?

26:46.343 --> 26:49.782
Because I tried stand-up,
and it didn't pan out.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.219
[chuckles]
Sorry.

26:52.262 --> 26:54.700
I didn't...
I didn't really try stand-up.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.919
Um, let me see.

26:56.963 --> 27:00.706
Because I wanted to feel
that what I did was important.

27:00.749 --> 27:02.795
Why'd you become a cop?

27:02.838 --> 27:05.362
To serve and protect.

27:05.406 --> 27:08.975
Just wanted to make
a difference, you know?Yeah.

27:09.018 --> 27:11.238
That's what I said
in my psych eval, too.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.459
The real reason
I became a cop is because...

27:15.503 --> 27:17.548
