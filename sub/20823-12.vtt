WEBVTT

00:02.650 --> 00:05.039
- Lights. Got it. Locks. Check!

00:05.090 --> 00:07.786
Alarm... Wait, we have
an alarm system?

00:09.960 --> 00:12.485
It'll be armed and activated
before I leave today, boss.

00:12.530 --> 00:14.486
Promise.

00:14.530 --> 00:16.748
Are you sure you'll be OK?
We can turn around.

00:16.790 --> 00:18.929
You get a free weekend

00:18.970 --> 00:21.097
at a swank country resort
and spa, you take it.

00:21.150 --> 00:24.449
- It's only because
we're doing a favour for
one of Shade's hockey buddies.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.491
- Still counts.

00:26.540 --> 00:28.622
I got you something.
Um, a little escape

00:28.680 --> 00:30.625
of your own. Check
the top drawer of your desk.

00:33.850 --> 00:36.284
- "Save yourself

00:36.340 --> 00:38.683
and the world,
at Midnight Meltdown."

00:38.730 --> 00:42.075
Huh! Thank you! What is it?

00:42.120 --> 00:45.817
Hello?

00:45.870 --> 00:49.215
No cell service.
- It's spotty up here.

00:49.260 --> 00:52.559
Plus... there's
a storm coming.

00:52.610 --> 00:54.999
Now, about this
infidelity case...

00:55.050 --> 00:57.268
- It shouldn't take
more than a few hours.

00:57.310 --> 00:59.653
- Good. Because I have
big plans for us.

00:59.710 --> 01:01.962
You've been
holding out on me, Dr. Graham.

01:02.010 --> 01:05.275
- First, we'll start with a
full-body aromatic rain scrub,

01:05.320 --> 01:07.402
followed by brunch
in Preston Hall's

01:07.450 --> 01:10.669
famous dining room, and then,
hot toddies under the stars.

01:10.720 --> 01:14.099
- You_had_ me at
"aromatic raIn scrub".

01:16.160 --> 01:18.674
- This place is beautiful.
I can't believe you know

01:18.730 --> 01:21.119
the owner.
Mark's like family.

01:21.160 --> 01:24.721
- You know, I don't
even care that it's a weird
work-weekend double-date thing,

01:24.780 --> 01:27.556
it's totally worth it.
- Ah! There they are!

01:27.600 --> 01:29.818
Glad you guys made it!
- Shadow!

01:29.870 --> 01:32.088
You mutt!
- Ah!

01:32.130 --> 01:34.121
Buddy! It's been
way too long.

01:34.180 --> 01:36.523
Guys, this is Mark. the best
winger I ever played with.

01:36.570 --> 01:39.357
- You got that right.
- It's Mel and Ken, and this

01:39.400 --> 01:41.049
is my partner
- You must be Angie.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.489
- Oh! He he!

01:43.530 --> 01:45.669
- Thank you guys for coming
to help with my situation.

01:45.710 --> 01:48.019
I know it's not ideal
- Mark!

01:48.060 --> 01:49.925
- Speaking of which...
- We need to talk

01:49.970 --> 01:52.313
about this month's billing.
- Honey, you remember

01:52.370 --> 01:53.849
Matt Shade, from my hockey days?

01:53.890 --> 01:55.755
You guys met at our wedding.
- William.

01:55.810 --> 01:59.109
Enjoy Preston Hall. I made
some changes to the menu.

01:59.160 --> 02:02.027
Tell Petra.

02:02.070 --> 02:05.289
- I'll... help you
get checked in.

02:05.340 --> 02:07.501
- Thank you!

02:07.560 --> 02:09.858
I remember him
being more charming.

02:09.910 --> 02:11.730
- He was.

02:11.780 --> 02:14.089
Then, the seven year
itch became a rash.

02:14.130 --> 02:16.690
Now it's all secret phone calls
and extended business trips.

02:16.740 --> 02:18.651
- Maybe there's
an honest explanation.

02:18.700 --> 02:21.692
- Well, he hasn't given me one
yet. But look at me,

02:21.750 --> 02:24.002
already with the shop talk.
For now, you're guests!

02:24.050 --> 02:27.349
Relax, do some
howling, decompress.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.005
We'll talk in the morning.
- OK.

02:32.710 --> 02:34.666
Preston Hall is famous

02:34.710 --> 02:37.361
for its midnight wolf howl
on the terrace. You'll love it.

02:37.410 --> 02:41.414
- Can't wait.

02:43.590 --> 02:46.889
- Lemme get this straight,
so we... yell out,

02:46.940 --> 02:50.683
And maybe the wolves
howl back, or not.

02:50.730 --> 02:53.164
And this is a thing?
- Yeah, it's a thing.

02:53.210 --> 02:56.077
: OK!
- Oh, here we go.

02:56.130 --> 02:58.553
- Alright, everybody!
Welcome to the Preston Howl.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.862
My name is Wade.
Let's stretch

03:00.910 --> 03:03.128
our lungs and let
the pack know we're here.

03:03.180 --> 03:06.616
On three. One, two...

03:16.280 --> 03:19.181
- Oh! Too bad
we're missing that!

03:19.240 --> 03:22.141
: What are we
doing here, Ken?

03:22.200 --> 03:25.067
- I wanted to talk_
to you about something.

03:27.200 --> 03:30.203
- Wow! That storm's
really picking up.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.241
It's a good thing
we got here tonight.

03:32.290 --> 03:36.249
- Oh my god.

03:36.300 --> 03:40.259
- So, there's a Mercy Ship
leaving for Africa in two weeks.

03:40.300 --> 03:43.303
They asked me to go...

03:45.480 --> 03:47.869
I said no.

03:52.790 --> 03:55.873
- Angie Everett...

03:55.930 --> 03:58.182
will you marry me?

04:09.510 --> 04:12.980
Oh my God!
It's William.

04:13.030 --> 04:15.282
- Looks like our
infidelity case just got

04:15.340 --> 04:18.946
a lot more complicated.
- Yeah.

04:18.990 --> 04:22.460
- I see you and you see me

04:22.520 --> 04:26.820
Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're makin' a scene

04:26.870 --> 04:30.431
Oh boy, you've got to know

04:30.480 --> 04:32.619
What my head overlooks

04:32.660 --> 04:36.300
The senses will show
to my heart

04:36.360 --> 04:41.229
When it's watching for lies
'cause you can't escape my

04:41.280 --> 04:44.317
- Private Eyes
They're watching you

04:44.370 --> 04:47.498
Private Eyes

04:47.540 --> 04:49.713
They're watching you,
watching you, watching you

04:49.760 --> 04:52.320
Watching you

04:55.030 --> 04:58.204
- OK, well, uh...

04:58.250 --> 05:01.117
Yeah, he's...he's
definitely... He's dead.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.161
Yes, he's really, um...

05:03.210 --> 05:05.201
I'm sorry--

05:07.300 --> 05:09.086
Oh... I'm sorry about that.

05:12.610 --> 05:15.522
Is there anyone else
coming, Deputy...?

05:15.570 --> 05:17.822
- Uh, Conroy.
Eddie Conroy. No...

05:17.880 --> 05:19.916
No, not at the moment
unfortunately.

05:19.970 --> 05:22.313
All the roads are closed,
there's a major pile-up

05:22.360 --> 05:24.612
on the seven, so, um...

05:24.670 --> 05:26.888
...I'm, uh, I'm here all alone!

05:26.930 --> 05:30.491
Which is great...
- Maybe we can help you.

05:30.540 --> 05:33.589
I'm Angie Everett, this is
my partner Matt Shade.

05:33.630 --> 05:36.235
We're private investigators.

05:36.290 --> 05:38.895
Uh, great! What brings you
to Preston Hall?

05:38.940 --> 05:41.067
- We're just on vacation,
a weekend getaway.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.463
- Yeah. This is
my boyfriend, uh, Ken,

05:43.510 --> 05:46.422
he's an ER doctor. And Mel.
She's a prosecutor.

05:46.470 --> 05:48.904
- Wow! You got like a...

05:48.950 --> 05:50.906
a Dream Team, here.
That's great!

05:50.950 --> 05:53.384
Uh, so, um...

05:55.520 --> 05:57.568
in this sort of scenario?

05:57.610 --> 05:59.566
- Um...

05:59.620 --> 06:01.781
you might want to secure
the crime scene.

06:01.830 --> 06:05.709
Make sure nobody leaves.
- Right. OH! That's-- OK. Great,

06:05.750 --> 06:08.184
Um... ladies and gentlemen?
Right, yeah. Right here, please.

06:08.230 --> 06:11.358
Um... so, there's a murderer

06:11.410 --> 06:14.049
among us. No one can leave.

06:14.110 --> 06:16.237
Definitely don't...

06:16.280 --> 06:17.975
leave.

06:18.020 --> 06:20.409
What do you think, how was that?

06:20.460 --> 06:22.280
- You might want to check
the crime scene

06:22.330 --> 06:24.412
for physical evidence.

06:24.470 --> 06:28.019
- OK! Right.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.685
: Do you want us
to come with you, Deputy?

06:30.730 --> 06:32.550
- I mean... I mean if you feel

06:32.600 --> 06:34.420
like, maybe, it's something
you'dlike to do...

06:37.130 --> 06:38.916
- William's final body position

06:38.960 --> 06:41.394
is facing away from the door.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.396
- Maybe he was trying to get
away from his attacker.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.659
- Or maybe he was comfortable
enough to turn his back on 'em.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.439
- Hey, hey, buddy, what are you
doing with that thing?

06:48.490 --> 06:52.278
- The body loses 1.5 degrees
per hour post-mortem.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.448
If I take his temperature, we
can determine the time of death.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.843
- An hour ago, give or take.

06:57.890 --> 07:00.677
- Oh! Wha-- You guys,

07:00.720 --> 07:02.847
you're blowing my mind
right now, really.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.118
What do you make
of this head wound?

07:05.160 --> 07:07.116
- Blu_nt for_ce trauma.
Something With some heft.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.469
- One of these bookends
IS missmg.

07:09.510 --> 07:12.161
- The killer probably
took it with them.

07:12.210 --> 07:14.110
Maybe it's still in the
building. So, all we gotta do

07:14.170 --> 07:16.422
is find it. and then...
- William has been dead

07:16.470 --> 07:19.382
an hour. The killer had plenty
of time to bury it in the woods.

07:19.430 --> 07:21.864
- Or throw it in the lake.
- One thing I do remember

07:21.910 --> 07:23.787
from training:

07:23.830 --> 07:25.821
vast majority of murders
involve spouses.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.223
So, I say, go down there,
we talk to Mark.

07:28.270 --> 07:30.830
You may be
on to something

07:30.880 --> 07:33.348
with this whole "finding
the murder weapon" thing.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.311
Why don't you go look for it,

07:35.360 --> 07:37.669
and we'll start interviewing
the guests and staff.

07:37.710 --> 07:39.496
- OK, OK, yeah.

07:39.540 --> 07:41.326
Locating, interviewing
witnesses,

07:41.370 --> 07:43.144
that is on the
investigative checklist...

07:43.200 --> 07:45.236
OK, alright, OK!
I'll, uh,

07:45.290 --> 07:47.758
check in with you guys later.

07:47.810 --> 07:50.540
Good work!

07:52.470 --> 07:54.506
- Did you just send him
on a wild goose chase

07:54.560 --> 07:56.858
to protect your friend?
- Look, I know Mark.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.719
There's no way he did this.

08:06.480 --> 08:09.347
He's my husband.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.528
- It's an active crime
scene. And rIght now

08:12.570 --> 08:14.709
you're Deputy Conroy's
number one suspect.

08:14.750 --> 08:17.059
- Dear God. This
cannot be happening.

08:17.100 --> 08:20.183
- Mark, I gotta ask you. What
were you doing an hour ago?

08:20.230 --> 08:23.404
- I was sleeping.
Matt, you know me.

08:23.450 --> 08:25.327
You know I could
never murder anyone.

08:25.370 --> 08:27.838
- Mark, I believe you.

08:27.890 --> 08:30.108
But it would really help us
if you could tell us...

08:30.160 --> 08:32.890
anything. Maybe...
something about William?

08:32.940 --> 08:35.852
- I don't know! I, um...

08:35.900 --> 08:39.370
William wasn't
the gentlest of souls.

08:39.430 --> 08:42.035
Who am I kidding? He could be
a first class prick!

08:42.080 --> 08:45.641
But to murder him
in cold blood...

08:45.690 --> 08:49.308
I wouldn't know where to look
for that kind of person.

08:49.350 --> 08:51.818
- We're gonna need
guest and staff lists,

08:51.870 --> 08:54.953
a master key and a detailed
plan of the hotel.

08:55.010 --> 08:58.229
- We do something called a
"memory package" for the guests.

08:58.270 --> 09:01.057
Uh... a photographer goes around

09:01.100 --> 09:03.921
taking candid snaps.

09:03.970 --> 09:06.712
- That would help.

09:12.370 --> 09:14.713
I say we split up,
start talking to staff.

09:14.770 --> 09:17.898
Someone here had a motive to
kill William. We just
have to find it.

09:17.940 --> 09:19.589
- OK.

09:22.340 --> 09:25.559
- You don't seem too broken up
about William's murder.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.420
- I still have
a hotel full of guests.

09:27.470 --> 09:29.779
Who's gonna feed them, you?
- Uh,

09:29.830 --> 09:32.697
we hear that he liked to change
your menu quite often.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.083
- I may run the kitchen,
but he signed the cheques.

09:35.130 --> 09:37.781
- But he interfered a lot.
Didn't that make you mad?

09:37.830 --> 09:40.139
- Who doesn't occasionally
have murderous thoughts

09:40.180 --> 09:42.614
about their boss?
- What about he

09:42.660 --> 09:44.969
and Mark's relationship?

09:45.010 --> 09:47.888
- Everyone could see
they were like oil and water.

09:47.930 --> 09:50.797
It was like watching
a car wreck in slow motion.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.716
- Excuse me, uh,
you're the one who found

09:55.760 --> 09:57.409
William's body?

09:57.460 --> 09:59.508
We were just wondering
if you remember anything

09:59.550 --> 10:01.893
out of the ordinary?

10:01.940 --> 10:04.283
No.
- I mean...

10:04.340 --> 10:07.298
about William's behaviour
over the last couple of days.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.161
- According to the service
schedule, you cleaned his
room more than once a day.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.997
- Yeah, William asked me to.
It was because...

10:13.040 --> 10:15.907
he was sleeping there
a lot. He and Mark--

10:15.960 --> 10:18.087
- We know. Their marriage
was on the rocks.

10:18.130 --> 10:20.519
- Last week,

10:20.570 --> 10:22.822
I went in to clean
his office and he asked

10:22.880 --> 10:25.656
to borrow a fresh
hotel uniform.

10:25.710 --> 10:28.668
- Mark set William's
clothes on fire?

10:28.710 --> 10:31.929
- Right there in the yard.
I had to put it out myself.

10:31.970 --> 10:33.665
- I didn't know
things were so bad!

10:33.720 --> 10:35.585
- Yeah, they
fought constantly.

10:35.630 --> 10:37.495
Mark was convinced William
was haVIng an affair.

10:37.540 --> 10:39.451
And man,
did he have a temper.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.843
- Sounds like you're pretty
firmly on Team William.

10:41.900 --> 10:44.460
- He was like
a father to me.

10:44.510 --> 10:46.375
He took a chance on me
right out of school.

10:46.420 --> 10:49.639
I've worked here ever since.
- Did you see him before
he died?

10:49.690 --> 10:52.386
- We had our regular
end-of—day meeting at 8 PM.

10:52.430 --> 10:55.035
- What did you
talk about at the meeting?

10:55.080 --> 10:57.036
- The usual: how
The Preston was feeling.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.388
What needed some
tender lovmg care.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.123
That, and...

11:01.180 --> 11:03.216
how he was planning
to divorce Mark.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.921
I can't believe it!

11:10.970 --> 11:13.609
- [I guess their marriage was
in worse shape than we thought.]

11:13.670 --> 11:16.104
- And you found all this out
from the wolf

11:16.150 --> 11:18.926
- And Mark doesn't know

11:18.980 --> 11:22.143
anything about it?

11:22.200 --> 11:24.805
[But between that
and the bonfire...]

11:24.850 --> 11:27.410
- You've gotta be kidding me.

11:27.460 --> 11:30.987
- Nothing! Ijust, uh... Ijust
forgot leave-in conditioner.

11:31.030 --> 11:33.248
Stupid.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.814
I'll meet you downstairs.

11:35.860 --> 11:39.125
I can talk to him alone.
- No! No, I, uh, I'm on
my way. Right now.

11:39.170 --> 11:42.082
- Angie, I was thinking...

11:44.870 --> 11:48.215
- Thank you for
your understanding.

11:48.270 --> 11:50.738
No. We appreciate it. OK.

11:50.790 --> 11:54.749
The guests are freaking out,
and I don't blame them.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.143
And I can only comp
so much free champagne

11:57.190 --> 12:00.148
before I run out of stock.
What'd you find out?

12:00.190 --> 12:03.193
- So far, You're our best lead.
- That doesn't sound promising.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.674
- Did you set William's
clothes on fire last week?

12:07.850 --> 12:10.762
- I caught him coming back
from a "business trip".

12:10.810 --> 12:13.415
He told me he was in Montreal...

12:13.470 --> 12:15.768
the bag tags said
Phoenix. So, I...

12:15.820 --> 12:17.629
lost it, I...
cleaned out his closet.

12:17.690 --> 12:20.864
- You got to admit, it doesn't
put you in the best light.

12:20.910 --> 12:23.219
- Well, you guys
might have been right.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.603
- You know, I looked everywhere

12:25.650 --> 12:27.789
for that dang murder weapon.
I even checked, uh...

12:27.830 --> 12:31.004
the utility closet. End of the
hallway, on the second floor.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.917
You know, that door handle
is broken from the inside?

12:33.970 --> 12:36.780
A man could get stuck in there
for 20, 30 minutes, easy..

12:36.840 --> 12:39.707
Incidentally, the only
place I couldn't check:

12:39.750 --> 12:41.832
your master suite.

12:41.890 --> 12:44.791
Key didn't work.

12:44.850 --> 12:47.193
- Because I have a separate key.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.800
Uh, here, I can let you in.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.805
- This should only
take a second.

12:56.860 --> 13:00.034
- Take your time.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.818
- Suddenly I'm a bit nervous.

13:05.870 --> 13:08.566
- You got nothing
to worry about.

13:13.790 --> 13:16.395
- Oh... actually...

13:16.440 --> 13:18.704
I can think of one thing.

13:29.890 --> 13:32.495
- Welcome to Midnight Meltdown,
an escape room adventure.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.939
You're an employee
of Colossus, the oldest

13:34.980 --> 13:37.585
and largest nuclear power plant
in the western hemisphere.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.596
The power grid
is shut down

13:39.640 --> 13:41.244
due to an
unexpected earthquake.

13:41.290 --> 13:44.851
And now, there's a lethal
cloud of radioactive material

13:44.910 --> 13:46.901
about to blow
your city slq high.

13:46.950 --> 13:49.555
- Yeah, I--
- But there's still hope.

13:49.610 --> 13:52.431
Through that door, there's
a passageway that leads

13:52.480 --> 13:54.436
to the director's office--
- Where there's a kill switch,

13:54.480 --> 13:56.562
right? And I'm supposed to
figure out the code, yeah?

13:56.610 --> 13:59.170
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm not gonna need

13:59.220 --> 14:00.869
any clues. Can I
just get started now?

14:00.920 --> 14:03.741
- Wait 'til your partner
gets here.

14:03.790 --> 14:07.180
Zoe?

14:09.450 --> 14:12.886
- Shade gave me a ticket, he
said this was a scotch tasting.

14:12.930 --> 14:15.979
This is not a scotch tasting.
- I got mine from Angie.

14:16.020 --> 14:18.068
- Uh-huh!

14:18.110 --> 14:19.896
- We've been set up.
- Don't they have anything

14:19.940 --> 14:22.374
better to do than _mess
With our dating lives?

14:22.420 --> 14:24.593
- We went... for one coffee.
- Exactly! And you never called.

14:24.640 --> 14:28.076
- And you never really indicated
that you wanted me to, so...

14:28.120 --> 14:31.169
: You got 90 minutes.
- This is silly. Let's just go.

14:31.210 --> 14:33.553
- Good luck, guys.

14:33.610 --> 14:35.737
[door bolt locking
and little chuckle from Maz]

14:40.310 --> 14:43.655
- I'm gonna kill 'em both.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.096
_ _ You're
keeping him under house arrest?

14:52.150 --> 14:54.232
- Yes, that's what I'm doing.
The road is closed

14:54.280 --> 14:56.532
because of the storm, we're
all stuck here until morning;

14:56.590 --> 14:58.933
I can't let a...
:...murderer

14:58.980 --> 15:01.494
have the run of the place.
That would be like being trapped

15:01.550 --> 15:03.939
in a... in a giant box
with a...

15:03.990 --> 15:06.413
murderer.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.597
- Come on! That was
clearly a setup.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.905
- Who hides a murder weapon
without cleaning off the blood?

15:11.950 --> 15:14.680
- I don't know, uh, someone
who's shaken by recent events?

15:14.730 --> 15:18.734
Look, guys,
I appreciate your help,

15:18.780 --> 15:21.340
but...
: ...I mean...

15:21.390 --> 15:24.302
come on, I... I think
we've nailed this one.

15:24.350 --> 15:27.353
I really do!

15:30.230 --> 15:33.358
- This won't be easy. Most of
the guests were in their rooms.

15:33.410 --> 15:36.277
- Nearly everyone has an alibi
for the time of the murder.

15:36.320 --> 15:39.050
"Carl Rennie".

15:39.110 --> 15:41.499
- He's a no. I saw the wait
staff helping him back

15:41.540 --> 15:43.622
to his room at 10: 30,
after one too many tequilas.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.196
- I don't recognize him.

15:48.250 --> 15:51.117
- No, never seen him before.
- We shall meet again,

15:51.160 --> 15:53.503
Mr. Abbott.
- That leaves us with only three

15:53.560 --> 15:55.551
unsubstantiated alibis.
- And there's Brynn Vaughan,

15:55.600 --> 15:58.512
Peter Abott and
the massage therapist.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.118
: I got the spa...

16:00.170 --> 16:02.695
- Great! You two go together
and I'll pair up with Mel.

16:02.740 --> 16:04.696
We'll check
Brynn Vaughan's alibi.

16:10.140 --> 16:12.608
- Spa's closed.

16:12.660 --> 16:15.049
- Ah, that's too bad!

16:15.100 --> 16:18.183
We were hoping to take a sauna,
take our minds off the murder.

16:18.230 --> 16:20.755
- You and everyone's mother!
Some ass hat

16:20.800 --> 16:22.973
cranked it up to full and set
the timer for three hours.

16:23.020 --> 16:25.272
Burnt out the element.
How about I book you in

16:25.330 --> 16:27.286
for a couple's
massage tomorrow?

16:27.330 --> 16:31.539
- We're not together.
- Right.

16:31.590 --> 16:34.150
- Uh, what time do you
usually close?

16:34.210 --> 16:37.202
- Uh, usually around eight.
Sometimes earlier,

16:37.250 --> 16:39.718
if no one's using it.
Tonight was pretty dead.

16:39.780 --> 16:42.123
- I just got back.

16:42.170 --> 16:44.730
I spend Friday nights in the
laundry room doing the linens.

16:44.780 --> 16:47.908
Uh, plus there's
this housekeeper,

16:47.960 --> 16:51.566
Kristi... Let's just say
we enjoy each other's company.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.187
- Oh, hi! Are you
Brynn Vaughan?

17:01.230 --> 17:04.279
- I don't do autographs.
- Oh, wait-wait-wait! Um...

17:04.320 --> 17:06.311
that's too bad...

17:06.370 --> 17:08.326
because I'm
a really big fan.

17:08.370 --> 17:12.283
: Fine. Let's
just get this over with.

17:12.330 --> 17:15.629
So, who's your favourite
housewife on the show?

17:15.680 --> 17:18.331
Besides me.
- Ha!

17:18.380 --> 17:20.336
- Um...
- There's so many.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.336
- Um...
- You know who we don't like

17:22.380 --> 17:25.076
and that is, uh...

17:25.130 --> 17:28.770
: ...Chelsea!
- Yeah, tell me about it.

17:28.830 --> 17:32.049
- So! What does a girl
like you do for fun?

17:32.090 --> 17:34.650
- Well...
- Say, earlier tonight,

17:34.700 --> 17:38.488
between eleven and midnight?
- That's... oddly specific!

17:38.530 --> 17:40.612
- We're oddly curious...

17:40.660 --> 17:42.878
- Look, Cagney and Lacey,

17:42.930 --> 17:45.182
I don't have
to tell you anything.

17:45.230 --> 17:48.791
- Well, I don't have to tell TMZ
that you just got a nose job.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.977
- Look,

17:51.020 --> 17:53.625
if this is about
William, I am devastated.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.625
I loved the man.
He knew how to keep

17:55.680 --> 17:57.671
a secret, and
I trust you do too.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.109
And, for the record, I was
on the phone with my agent

18:00.160 --> 18:02.720
from ten 'til midnight.
Check with the front desk,

18:02.770 --> 18:05.898
they placed the call for me.

18:05.950 --> 18:08.817
- Two lagers, whatever's
cold and on tap.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.940
- One good thing about
your host getting murdered,

18:11.000 --> 18:12.956
everyone drinks
for free! Ha ha!

18:13.000 --> 18:15.389
Hey, I'm Matt Shade.
This is my buddy Ken.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.136
- Uh, Peter. Abbott.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.216
- I'm a wine merchant.
I'm one of the suppliers

18:20.270 --> 18:22.909
to Preston Hall.
What're you drinking?

18:22.970 --> 18:25.313
I can always use a tip or two
to impress the girlfriend.

18:25.360 --> 18:28.056
- A 1990 Au-Croix.
It's a beautiful pour.

18:28.100 --> 18:31.399
- Copy that. You must spend a
little bit of time at this bar?

18:31.450 --> 18:33.884
- I've been sitting
here all night.

18:33.930 --> 18:35.932
If you don't mind,
guys, to be honest,

18:35.980 --> 18:38.369
I prefer to be alone.

18:38.420 --> 18:41.639
- That was a little weird.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.852
- The old Shade
charm strikes again.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.425
- Brynn Vaughan's a no-go.

18:48.470 --> 18:51.769
- So is the spa guy.
- Which leaves us with
Mr. Abbott over there.

18:51.820 --> 18:54.516
He says he's been stapled
to that bar stool all night.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.164
- Maybe nursing
a guilty conscience?

18:56.220 --> 18:58.518
- Not to mention that 1990
Au-Croix is dishwater.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.697
That whole region was
decimated by rain that year.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.083
- Let's say we find out if
his true specialty is murder.

19:03.140 --> 19:06.007
Shade?

19:06.050 --> 19:08.746
- As a prosecutor, it's probably
better if you don't know.

19:15.410 --> 19:17.366
- Wine merchant, my ass.

19:17.410 --> 19:19.321
- We don't have much time. Let's
just get what we can on him

19:19.370 --> 19:21.326
and get out.
- Right.

19:31.250 --> 19:34.424
I think
I found something.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.738
- I could ask you the
same thing, Mr. Abbott.

19:44.790 --> 19:47.748
Or should I say: Mr. Rex Mundy.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.443
- Let's not jump to conclusions.
- Because you checked in

19:53.490 --> 19:56.050
under a false
name and have no alibi
for the time of the murder?

19:56.100 --> 19:59.319
- I can explain that.
I own Patriot Properties.

19:59.370 --> 20:02.498
It's a chain of boutique hotels
across the south-west of the US.

20:02.540 --> 20:05.498
- OK, so what
are you doing here?

20:05.550 --> 20:08.246
- You're gonna love prison!

20:08.290 --> 20:10.599
It's just like
a hotel room you get

20:10.640 --> 20:13.279
to enjoy all by yourself.
- Fine.

20:13.340 --> 20:15.979
I was buying Preston Hall.

20:17.910 --> 20:19.866
- Mark didn't
mention any sale.

20:19.910 --> 20:23.129
- Mark didn't know.

20:23.170 --> 20:25.309
- You're the one

20:25.350 --> 20:28.217
William was secretly phoning,
who he went to see in Phoenix?

20:28.270 --> 20:30.431
- This is a great property.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.481
It was too good
of a deal to pass up.

20:32.530 --> 20:35.226
- 1.3 million!

20:35.270 --> 20:38.706
- 1.3 million; this place
is worth ten times that much!

20:38.750 --> 20:41.753
- I know! 1.3 on paper.
The rest...

20:41.800 --> 20:44.268
- ...wired to an offshore
bank account.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.413
William was hiding the money
before he divorced Mark!

20:47.460 --> 20:49.928
- When's the last time
you saw William?

20:49.980 --> 20:52.858
- We met at 5:30
to finalize the deal.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.800
We signed some papers,
we put them in an envelope

20:54.860 --> 20:57.283
on the corner of his desk. He
was gonna drop 'em by his lawyer

20:57.340 --> 20:58.898
on Monday morning.
- There was no envelope

20:58.950 --> 21:01.817
when we checked on the body.
- It was there, I swear.

21:01.860 --> 21:05.296
Check with room
service; I was so happy,

21:05.350 --> 21:07.739
I ordered the most
expenswe steak on the menu.

21:07.780 --> 21:10.431
- Well, I hope you enjoyed it.
'Cause whatever deal you had

21:10.480 --> 21:14.302
probably died with William.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.783
- Sounded legit.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.649
- What do you make
of the missing envelope?

21:18.710 --> 21:21.270
By killing William and
removing evidence of the sale,

21:21.320 --> 21:24.016
the hotel would be disbursed
according to William's will.

21:24.060 --> 21:26.016
- Which takes us
right back to Mark.

21:26.060 --> 21:28.108
Look, we're gonna keep looking.

21:28.150 --> 21:30.015
But in the meantime, you
should probably let Mark know

21:30.070 --> 21:32.630
what we learned.
- Not looking forward
to that conversation.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.500
- I'll update Mel and Ken.
- Yeah.

21:34.550 --> 21:37.064
- And I'll meet
you in the bar.

21:47.260 --> 21:49.387
- You can't just
randomly push numbers.

21:49.430 --> 21:51.341
That's not how it works.
- Better than doing nothing.

21:51.390 --> 21:54.120
- I'm not doing nothing,
I'm assessing the space.

21:54.180 --> 21:56.603
There's gotta be
a clue here somewhere.

21:56.660 --> 21:59.174
- Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that.

22:09.110 --> 22:12.102
You were saying?

22:12.150 --> 22:14.937
- Huh!

22:17.810 --> 22:19.858
- "A coded sequence
gets you through,

22:19.900 --> 22:21.720
"inside stonework
is your clue.

22:21.770 --> 22:23.818
"Punch it twice
and trapped you'll be,

22:23.860 --> 22:25.896
punchitthnce
and you'll be free."

22:25.950 --> 22:29.647
- "Inside stonework"...
It's in the walls.

22:29.690 --> 22:31.999
- No, it's a code. Trust me,
I'm good at puzzles.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.769
- As opposed to me,
the actual detective?

22:33.830 --> 22:37.914
- Look. Each letter
has a numerical value.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.428
We figure out the number
and then put it three times

22:40.480 --> 22:42.653
we're gold.
- You know it's an escape room,

22:42.700 --> 22:45.009
right? Not Fort Knox!
- S is nineteen,

22:45.050 --> 22:48.611
T is twenty... Are you
gonna help me or what?

22:48.670 --> 22:51.400
- Yeah, I'd help you
if your plan made any sense.

22:51.450 --> 22:53.918
I mean, the code you're
describing is 20 digits long.

22:53.980 --> 22:57.279
- Fine, I'll do it myself.
- Hey, You know what number

22:57.330 --> 22:59.230
is inside stonework?

23:03.730 --> 23:05.675
One.

23:05.730 --> 23:07.948
- No way.

23:07.990 --> 23:10.299
You really think putting in
the number 1 three times

23:10.340 --> 23:12.808
is gonna magically
open the door?

23:12.860 --> 23:15.340
[electronic beeps
and bolt unlocking]

23:21.180 --> 23:24.434
- The Director's Office.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.788
That's where the
kill switch is. Hum!

23:26.840 --> 23:29.047
Which you would know
if you were here on time.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.000
- This is way too easy.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.327
- No, it's just protocol.

23:42.370 --> 23:44.452
You don't have
a shiv though, do you?

23:44.510 --> 23:46.375
- No!
- I gotta ask these things.

23:46.420 --> 23:48.809
Go ahead.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.819
- Well, I've been accused
of murdering my husband, and

23:59.870 --> 24:01.997
thanks to Deputy Do-right I
can't even get a decent drink,

24:02.040 --> 24:04.213
so... I've
had better days.

24:04.260 --> 24:06.694
- Yeah...

24:06.740 --> 24:09.391
you recognize this guy?

24:09.440 --> 24:11.704
- Nope! Uh,
what's his story?

24:11.750 --> 24:14.833
- He may be the last person
to have seen William alive.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.758
- No.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.406
- He's the_reason
for the late night phone
calls and the business trips,

24:21.460 --> 24:24.145
but they weren't
having an affair.

24:26.550 --> 24:28.848
William was...

24:28.900 --> 24:30.674
trying to sell
Preston Hall.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.857
He was...

24:32.900 --> 24:35.027
planning to divorce you,

24:35.080 --> 24:39.039
divest the property on paper
for a tenth of its value,

24:39.080 --> 24:41.867
and hide the rest
in an off-shore account.

24:41.910 --> 24:45.084
I'm sorry.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.528
- Well, there go
my thirties!

24:49.570 --> 24:51.743
I didn't deserve them, anyway.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.840
Was I the only one
who didn't see it?

25:03.890 --> 25:06.586
- Nobody had any idea.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.098
- Now I wish I did kill him.

25:11.110 --> 25:14.068
This was his idea,
you know. This place.

25:14.120 --> 25:17.339
Not mine.

25:17.380 --> 25:19.814
He dragged me out here...

25:19.860 --> 25:22.294
made me leave behind
my whole life...

25:30.610 --> 25:32.862
- We're gonna
figure this out, Mark.

25:35.960 --> 25:38.781
I spoke to Mark. He seemed
genuinely surprised.

25:38.840 --> 25:40.649
Think fast.

25:47.020 --> 25:50.626
- I didn't know you put it on.
- Congratulations!

25:54.290 --> 25:57.066
- I guess so!

25:57.120 --> 26:00.942
- Uh, wow! That's... incredible!

26:00.990 --> 26:04.369
- Thanks! Um...

26:04.430 --> 26:06.466
we should... probably
focus on the case.

26:06.520 --> 26:09.125
We need to re-check
William's office

26:09.170 --> 26:11.604
for the sale documents.

26:11.650 --> 26:14.869
I think I'm
done playing detective tonight.

26:14.920 --> 26:17.480
I'm gonna go back to the room.

26:17.530 --> 26:20.613
- I'll walk you up.
- No, I'm fine.

26:20.660 --> 26:23.709
- You two do your thing.
I'll walk her.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.488
- Well... it's
not how I saw

26:30.540 --> 26:33.361
this weekend playing out.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.810
_ This_ is not _
happening, this was a mistake.

26:44.860 --> 26:47.169
- Don't give up!

26:47.210 --> 26:49.644
There's gotta be another way.
- We're running out of time!

26:49.690 --> 26:51.999
- OK, let's just take
a step back, alright? OH!

26:52.040 --> 26:54.508
What are we missing?

26:54.560 --> 26:57.040
- Oh no, it doesn't do anything.

26:57.090 --> 26:59.172
I tried it when we got here.
- It says "up".

26:59.220 --> 27:01.745
- I dunno, I guess it was in
the up position when we started.

27:04.360 --> 27:06.999
- Oh, I just assumed
it was part of the building.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.358
- You know that
this isn't actually

27:09.410 --> 27:11.219
a nuclear
reactor, right?

27:11.280 --> 27:14.147
- OK, if you're
gonna sass me, maybe
don't mispronounce nuclear.

27:14.190 --> 27:16.841
Jeez! Have you done this before?

27:16.890 --> 27:19.711
- Oh! OK. Give me a boost.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.718
- Yeah. Alright...

27:22.770 --> 27:25.898
- Woo! Whoa!
You're strong!

27:25.940 --> 27:28.249
- Your astonishment
is flattering.

27:30.470 --> 27:32.813
Oh, look! There's
another switch under here.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.680
- Oh, great!

27:34.740 --> 27:36.423
We wasted so much time on these
lasers. If we had just,

27:36.480 --> 27:38.550
you know, found this
and opened it up...

27:38.610 --> 27:40.601
- You know, we can talk
when you get back down.

27:40.650 --> 27:43.266
- Right.

27:43.310 --> 27:45.744
Ha!

27:45.790 --> 27:47.963
- Nice one, copper!
- Alright.

27:48.010 --> 27:49.568
- Now let's get to that
Director's office

27:49.620 --> 27:51.702
and stop the Eastern Seaboard
from nuclear meltdown!

27:55.540 --> 27:59.317
- Oh, you're out of time.
The reactor exploded,

27:59.370 --> 28:02.328
spewing radiation all over homes
and businesses. Thousands died.

28:02.370 --> 28:05.021
- But... we were almost there!
- No, you weren't.

28:05.070 --> 28:07.982
- There's like a
whole lot more puzzles
in the Director's office.

28:08.030 --> 28:09.804
- Buddy, can you just
give us another hour?

28:09.860 --> 28:12.818
- I'm sorry, the room's booked.

28:12.860 --> 28:15.590
Um, actually,
they cancelled.

28:15.650 --> 28:18.778
Yeah?

28:20.780 --> 28:22.953
Alright! Good dude!

28:23.000 --> 28:26.299
- We can do this.

28:34.230 --> 28:36.869
- There's no sign
of these papers.

28:36.930 --> 28:39.535
- Hey, uh, partner...

28:39.580 --> 28:41.844
wanna talk about
that rock on your finger?

28:41.890 --> 28:44.495
- The proposal came out
of nowhere. I wasn't ready.

28:47.500 --> 28:50.674
- I... didn't. Oh no,
I just tried the ring on

28:50.720 --> 28:52.802
to see what it looked like,
and it got stuck.

28:52.860 --> 28:56.239
- Yeah! Ken's...

28:56.290 --> 28:58.941
probably up there, right now,
just more confused than ever.

28:58.990 --> 29:00.946
I'll explain it all to him
once we get through here.

29:03.690 --> 29:06.477
- Hey, there's...
blood on this pot.

29:06.520 --> 29:09.080
- That's too far from the body
to be blood splatter.

29:09.130 --> 29:12.179
- Unless the body got moved.

29:12.220 --> 29:15.610
There's blood on this door too.

29:19.490 --> 29:21.799
- Wait, there's...

29:21.840 --> 29:23.705
a cold breeze coming
from behind this panel.

29:23.760 --> 29:26.627
Ugh!

29:33.110 --> 29:36.546
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

29:36.600 --> 29:40.422
- Ah... no. I could use a break.

29:40.470 --> 29:43.644
- That too. Hm!

29:43.690 --> 29:45.646
- Ha!

29:45.690 --> 29:47.646
To your engagement.

29:47.690 --> 29:50.432
- Might be a little
premature on that.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.823
She hasn't actually
said yes yet.

29:52.870 --> 29:55.304
- But she's... wearing the ring!

29:55.350 --> 29:57.818
- I was surprised, too.
Every time I get close,

29:57.880 --> 30:00.440
she... pulls away.

30:00.490 --> 30:02.742
- What do you think
the holdup is?

30:02.800 --> 30:05.837
- The proposal was interrupted
when we found the body.

30:05.890 --> 30:09.667
And she's been...
preoccupied.

30:09.720 --> 30:13.235
- So has Shade.

30:17.420 --> 30:19.376
- It was probably built during
Prohibition. A way to move

30:19.420 --> 30:21.945
booze back and forth through
the hotel without being seen.

30:21.990 --> 30:23.855
- And still in use today.

30:23.900 --> 30:25.856
Well, at least
by whoever killed William.

30:25.910 --> 30:27.810
- There's no way
a guest knew about this.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.294
It's gotta be
hotel staff.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.864
- Whoa, there's a light.

30:32.910 --> 30:36.949
There's a door here!
- Well, here goes nothing.

30:45.060 --> 30:48.882
Man, you scared the crap out of
me. Where did you come from?

30:48.930 --> 30:51.057
- I think we just figured out
how the murder weapon

30:51.110 --> 30:53.977
ended up in your room.

31:00.590 --> 31:02.808
- It's an old service corridor
from when the hotel

31:02.860 --> 31:04.589
was originally built.
- And it leads directly

31:04.640 --> 31:07.029
from William's office
to Mark's suite.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.776
- Yeah, that is some next-level
cool right there, for sure.

31:09.820 --> 31:12.129
Why are you telling me this?
- Because someone could have

31:12.170 --> 31:13.990
planted the murder weapon
in Mark's room!

31:14.040 --> 31:18.079
- Oh, OK, OK, I got you! Using
the corridors, is what you mean.

31:18.130 --> 31:21.179
- Exactly.
- Uh-huh. Except, OK...

31:21.220 --> 31:24.087
what if that person
happened to be Mark?

31:24.140 --> 31:27.268
- Well, that would be possible.
- No, no. Mark left his room

31:27.320 --> 31:29.925
when he found out about the
murder, and he didn't go back

31:29.970 --> 31:32.097
until you placed him
under house arrest.

31:32.150 --> 31:33.924
- There was ample opportunity
for someone to sneak in and out.

31:33.970 --> 31:36.621
- Look, guys.
I hear you, I do.

31:36.670 --> 31:38.626
But, uh...

31:38.670 --> 31:40.626
I gotta go
with my gut on this one.

31:40.680 --> 31:43.501
- And your "gut"
tells you it's Mark?

31:43.550 --> 31:47.111
- When the weather clears, he's
gonna be charged with murder.

31:47.160 --> 31:50.288
I'm sorry.

31:53.300 --> 31:55.939
-_ What are we
missmg, Everett?

31:56.000 --> 31:57.945
- I don't know.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.956
- It felt like
I had to choose

32:00.000 --> 32:02.309
between Angie
or the adventures.

32:02.350 --> 32:05.478
So I started putting down roots,
so she could see just how much

32:05.530 --> 32:07.953
she means to me.

32:08.010 --> 32:11.184
- You shouldn't
have to lose yourself
just to make things work.

32:13.880 --> 32:17.270
Did you really go ice
climbing with Richard Branson?

32:17.320 --> 32:19.231
- Once you get over the whole
height thing, it's actually

32:19.280 --> 32:21.100
really beautiful.

32:21.150 --> 32:24.142
All that water, frozen in time.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.930
- Can you really see Angie

32:26.980 --> 32:29.540
rappelling down a waterfall
with an axe in her hand?

32:29.590 --> 32:32.639
Definitely.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.422
If it were for a case!

32:40.560 --> 32:43.347
- OK, let's walk it through.

32:43.390 --> 32:46.348
_ We know that
William was secretly
trying to sell Preston Hall.

32:46.390 --> 32:48.346
- Except there's no proof,
because the murderer took

32:48.400 --> 32:51.005
the sale documents.
- Which doesn't make any sense,

32:51.050 --> 32:53.484
unless you're trying to
prevent knowledge of the sale.

32:53.530 --> 32:55.998
- OK. But who would
want to do that?

32:56.060 --> 32:58.790
- Someone with as much interest

32:58.840 --> 33:01.183
in the hotel as Rex Mundy.
- It would have to be

33:01.240 --> 33:02.889
someone with inside
knowledge of Preston Hall.

33:02.930 --> 33:05.012
- Everyone has an alibi
for the time of the murder

33:05.070 --> 33:08.016
except for Mark...

33:08.070 --> 33:11.506
unless the_time
of the murder is wrong.

33:11.550 --> 33:13.939
- But Ken measured
the time of death.

33:13.990 --> 33:15.719
I mean, we can't
argue with science.

33:15.770 --> 33:18.238
- Unless our murd_erer_
knows how to mess With time.

33:18.300 --> 33:21.030
The sauna was left on high
for three hours last night

33:21.080 --> 33:24.254
and the secret tunnels
lead right here.

33:31.790 --> 33:34.042
- Not since the last time

33:34.090 --> 33:36.308
you asked me, 30 seconds ago.
: OK...

33:36.360 --> 33:38.578
Well that punk is
gonna be here any minute.

33:38.620 --> 33:40.668
- We've already let humanity
down once, today, I don't think

33:40.710 --> 33:42.928
the irradiated mutants we
created know the difference.

33:42.970 --> 33:45.495
- I really thought we'd make

33:45.540 --> 33:49.362
a good team.
- We kinda do make a good team.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.453
- OK, bonus
doomsday time is up.

33:54.510 --> 33:56.239
At least, you guys managed
to kill the cockroaches.

33:56.290 --> 33:59.589
- Could we just have
a bit more time, please?

33:59.640 --> 34:02.029
- Oh God! I gotta lock up! I've
got my adult colouring class

34:02.080 --> 34:04.071
in the morning.
- "Adult colouring"--

34:04.120 --> 34:06.259
- It relaxes me.
- Here's 200 bucks,

34:06.300 --> 34:08.120
buy yourself some locally-
sourced pencil crayons.

34:08.170 --> 34:10.900
Why don't you
give us the keys.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.518
We'll lock up and leave them
in the mailbox for you.

34:12.570 --> 34:15.084
You know
this is a game, right?

34:15.140 --> 34:17.779
- Hey, whoa. The mutant world
is counting on us.

34:17.830 --> 34:20.264
- Uh... Uh... OK, fine,

34:20.310 --> 34:22.130
Ijust...

34:22.190 --> 34:24.351
I can't believe I'm doing this.
- Wait--

34:26.760 --> 34:29.103
- Are you ready
to finish this?

34:29.150 --> 34:31.232
- Oh, we are just
getting started.

34:36.940 --> 34:38.805
- I couldn't imagine
popping the question

34:38.850 --> 34:41.193
to the same person
five years apart

34:41.250 --> 34:43.332
and expecting
a different answer.

34:43.380 --> 34:45.109
- Now that you put it
that way, it does sound

34:45.170 --> 34:48.549
like the definition of insanity.
- Or wildly romantic.

34:50.820 --> 34:53.084
- Does Shade do that thing
where you're talking to him

34:53.130 --> 34:56.861
and his "uh-huh's" are just
ever so slightly out of place?

34:56.920 --> 35:00.048
- Like he's 50% with me
and 50% with a case?

35:00.090 --> 35:03.264
- Exactly. Angie
does that all the time.

35:03.310 --> 35:05.961
- To our partners.

35:06.010 --> 35:08.001
May they
someday realize

35:08.060 --> 35:10.051
just how awesome we are.

35:12.060 --> 35:14.711
- Oh! We know who did it!

35:14.760 --> 35:17.320
But we need both your brains
to figure out exactly how.

35:20.240 --> 35:23.152
You said you needed help.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.418
We do need your help, Wade.

35:25.470 --> 35:28.155
Figuring out
what happened to William.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.508
- You know, the biggest
mystery was figuring out

35:30.560 --> 35:32.687
how William's killer
had an airtight alibi

35:32.730 --> 35:35.290
for the time of death.
- Until we realized

35:35.350 --> 35:38.695
the time of death wasn't
the time of death at all.

35:38.740 --> 35:41.391
- The human body can tell us
with remarkable accuracy

35:41.440 --> 35:43.908
when death occurred.
Assuming it was laid to rest

35:43.960 --> 35:46.918
at room temperature.
- If, however, the body was

35:46.970 --> 35:50.053
placed in a hotter
environment -- say, a sauna --

35:50.100 --> 35:52.876
the time of death will be
completely inaccurate.

35:52.930 --> 35:55.922
- Garrett told us someon_e
cranked up the sauna last night.

35:55.970 --> 35:59.189
Left it on for three hours.
- Moving William's time of death

35:59.240 --> 36:01.754
from 11 PM back to 8 PM.

36:01.810 --> 36:04.278
- Which is exactly
when you were having

36:04.330 --> 36:06.150
your nightly meeting
with William, wasn't it?

36:06.200 --> 36:08.418
- You're saying
I killed William,

36:08.470 --> 36:10.938
then dragged his body
across the lobby,

36:10.990 --> 36:13.208
past the restaurant?
- It'd be so much easier

36:13.250 --> 36:15.115
if you could do it
discreetly through, say,

36:15.170 --> 36:18.344
a secret passage.

36:18.390 --> 36:21.905
Like that one.
- Which just happens

36:21.960 --> 36:24.827
to go directly
to the spa --

36:24.870 --> 36:27.043
which is where
the sauna is --

36:27.090 --> 36:28.910
after passing Mark's room,

36:28.960 --> 36:31.269
which is where you dropped
off the murder weapon.

36:31.310 --> 36:34.393
He was like a father to me.

36:34.450 --> 36:37.351
- After they discovered the
body, there was something else

36:37.410 --> 36:39.878
missing from the room,
besides the murder weapon.

36:39.930 --> 36:43.491
- An envelope with documents
for a sale of Preston Hall.

36:43.540 --> 36:46.100
- The killer took
them to try and prevent
the sale from taking place.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.720
And you'll never guess
where we found them.

36:48.770 --> 36:52.069
Tucked in the eaves
of your tool shed.

36:59.950 --> 37:02.999
- William always said...

37:03.040 --> 37:05.952
that if he ever
decided to move on...

37:06.000 --> 37:08.912
I'd get the hotel.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.918
Then, last night,

37:11.960 --> 37:14.178
he drops that
bombshell on me.

37:14.230 --> 37:17.700
"The hotel's sold, he says.
It's a done deal."

37:17.750 --> 37:20.355
I tried to talk him out of it,
told him that I could get

37:20.410 --> 37:23.755
some financing together,
but he just laughed at me.

37:23.800 --> 37:27.270
Ten years, I've given
everything to the Preston,

37:27.330 --> 37:32.154
then he just sells the hotel
out from under me...

37:34.120 --> 37:36.509
I just lost it.

37:38.510 --> 37:41.468
I couldn't see straight.

37:46.040 --> 37:48.998
- Wade Briggs...

37:49.040 --> 37:51.827
you're under arrest for
the murder of William Hadley.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.304
Gimme your hands.

37:58.880 --> 38:02.407
Does anyone know how these...
I... I... I... I got it.

38:02.450 --> 38:05.408
OK, let's go, let's go, come on.

38:05.450 --> 38:08.010
Hey, we really nailed
this one, huh, guys?

38:08.060 --> 38:10.494
- We sure did, Deputy.

38:10.540 --> 38:12.588
- Let's go.

38:27.040 --> 38:30.294
Yeah. So fun my hangover
now has twins.

38:30.350 --> 38:33.035
: Look,
I know this weekend

38:33.090 --> 38:35.524
didn't go quite as planned,
but I'll make it up to you.

38:37.750 --> 38:40.093
- I have to get back
to the city, there's a...

38:40.140 --> 38:42.358
big case that I have
to prepare for.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.356
- What better place
to prepare than here?

38:44.400 --> 38:46.960
_ We can lock ourselves
in our room, order all the food

38:47.020 --> 38:49.796
off the menu. This place is
the ultimate couples retreat.

38:52.370 --> 38:54.588
- That's the problem.

38:54.630 --> 38:56.678
We're not the ones
who look like the couple.

39:06.380 --> 39:11.158
- The prosecution
rests, Matt. Alone.

39:30.150 --> 39:32.493
- Finally got it off.

39:35.460 --> 39:39.669
Listen, Ken... you're
an incredible person, but...

39:43.460 --> 39:46.896
Any woman would be lucky
to have you in their life.

39:49.820 --> 39:52.118
I'm just not
ready to say yes.

39:56.170 --> 39:59.867
- Maybe I could still
make it on that Mercy Ship.

39:59.910 --> 40:02.470
- You know you wanna go.

40:02.530 --> 40:04.748
You don't wanna
be tied down.

40:10.530 --> 40:13.658
: Looks
like the storm's broken.

40:17.110 --> 40:20.329
: Come here.

40:50.660 --> 40:53.652
- I knew having you around
would bring me some luck.

40:53.710 --> 40:55.484
- How does it feel
to be the boss?

40:55.540 --> 40:58.668
- _I'm not sure
it swts me.

40:58.710 --> 41:00.666
- Well, you can always
make a change.

41:00.710 --> 41:03.759
Rex Mundy is still
interested in buying this hotel.

41:03.800 --> 41:06.416
You never know what
your forties can bring.

41:06.460 --> 41:10.157
- You're right.
Thank you, Shadow.

41:10.200 --> 41:12.668
Always been a hell
of a teammate.

41:12.730 --> 41:14.948
- Right back at you, Steinman.
- Gentlemen.

41:14.990 --> 41:17.857
Road is officially open,

41:17.910 --> 41:21.516
Wade's on his way back to town.
Sergeant even came in himself,

41:21.560 --> 41:24.609
so... it's kind
of a big deal.

41:24.650 --> 41:27.517
It's my first arrest.
- You don't say.

41:27.570 --> 41:29.993
- Well, technically,
I was your first.

41:30.050 --> 41:32.518
- Yeah, well, yeah,
technically, yeah, but uh...

41:32.570 --> 41:35.175
I was kinda hoping
that maybe, just...

41:35.230 --> 41:38.313
we'd keep that between
ourselves, if that's OK...

41:40.580 --> 41:42.275
- Your secret's safe
With me, Deputy.

41:42.320 --> 41:44.754
- OK. Alright, well...

41:44.800 --> 41:47.234
you guys be good!

41:47.280 --> 41:49.748
So, that's there.

42:00.430 --> 42:02.728
Hello!

42:02.780 --> 42:05.908
Hello. Officer?

42:09.130 --> 42:12.782
- Hey! You're back.

42:12.830 --> 42:16.266
- We might need another hour.

42:27.980 --> 42:30.585
- Hey, partner!

42:30.630 --> 42:33.269
- Hey!

42:33.330 --> 42:36.891
- Well, that was a night.
- You can say that again.

42:36.940 --> 42:40.728
- Solved a m_urder_.
- Prevented a miscarriage
of justice.

42:40.770 --> 42:42.726
- Couldn't have
done it Without you.

42:42.770 --> 42:45.238
- We do make a pretty good team.

42:48.340 --> 42:51.423
- Oh, he's off
on his next adventure.

42:51.480 --> 42:53.778
- Aw...
- I'm happy for him.

42:53.830 --> 42:56.788
And Mel?

42:56.830 --> 43:00.175
- Aw, we had some
good times, but, uh...

43:00.220 --> 43:04.520
that's not gonna work out.
- Hm!

43:04.580 --> 43:07.048
- Yep!

43:09.020 --> 43:10.965
- You really think
the Porsche is gonna start?

43:13.190 --> 43:15.146
- Yeah, it was quite a storm.

43:17.070 --> 43:19.288
- How'bout we just sit here
for a minute before we give it

43:19.330 --> 43:22.379
a try?
- You read my mind.
