00:23.068 --> 00:26.729
Why does physical education class
have to be so physical?

00:26.796 --> 00:28.849
I hate running.
It gives me wedgies.

00:28.916 --> 00:31.427
Oh, it's up there
so bad right now.

00:31.494 --> 00:32.768
Hey, Gene, Alex.

00:32.835 --> 00:33.951
Pick up the pace.

00:34.018 --> 00:36.389
Less jib-jab,
more jog-jog.

00:36.584 --> 00:39.072
Oh, hey, let's just lay
down and pretend we're dead.

00:39.139 --> 00:40.568
No, no, no, that doesn't work.

00:40.635 --> 00:41.979
We need to almost throw up.

00:42.046 --> 00:44.202
He hates vomit. Watch.

00:45.185 --> 00:48.006
Oh, no. Oh-oh, God.
Oh, gross, gross, gross.

00:48.073 --> 00:49.155
You do it, too.

00:51.763 --> 00:54.037
All right, all right.
You two, take a breather.

00:54.104 --> 00:55.600
Go sit on the side.

00:55.898 --> 00:57.588
Wow, that worked really
well.

00:57.655 --> 00:59.373
Hey I'm gonna try that
in math class.

00:59.440 --> 01:00.439
Yeah. Do it.

01:00.506 --> 01:03.076
You know, we don't really hang
out that much outside of P.E.

01:03.143 --> 01:05.848
We could do lunch. I know a place.
It's the cafeteria.

01:05.915 --> 01:08.416
Or, do you want to sleep
over at my house tonight?

01:08.483 --> 01:09.889
Oh, sleepover?

01:09.956 --> 01:11.225
Sleep over.

01:11.292 --> 01:13.156
Uh, I...

01:13.266 --> 01:15.146
I guess I'm, uh...

01:15.213 --> 01:16.196
Hmm...

01:16.312 --> 01:18.062
- Did you just say yes?
- Did I?

01:18.129 --> 01:19.150
Yeah...

01:19.219 --> 01:20.272
S-Sure, yeah.

01:20.339 --> 01:21.873
- Great.
- G-Great!

01:21.970 --> 01:23.070
Damn it.

01:23.336 --> 01:24.564
You told Alex

01:24.631 --> 01:26.310
you'd sleep over at his house?

01:26.377 --> 01:28.166
Yes. No. Sort of.

01:28.233 --> 01:29.239
Wow. That's a big step

01:29.306 --> 01:31.027
from the last time you
got invited to a sleepover,

01:31.094 --> 01:33.028
and you asked if we could
move away for just one night

01:33.095 --> 01:34.123
so you wouldn't have to go.

01:34.190 --> 01:36.527
Ah! I don't want to go,
but I feel like I should.

01:36.594 --> 01:39.382
I'm the only kid in my grade
who hasn't done a sleepover.

01:39.449 --> 01:40.579
Maybe it's time to try it.

01:40.646 --> 01:42.621
Even if the thought of
it gives me inside hives,

01:42.688 --> 01:44.555
and a tummy full of...

01:44.622 --> 01:47.051
Gene, as someone who's been
invited to many sleepovers...

01:47.118 --> 01:48.140
- One.
- One.

01:48.207 --> 01:50.285
I can tell you that there's
nothing to be scared of.

01:50.352 --> 01:52.088
- They're fun.
- But what if I miss my bed?

01:52.155 --> 01:53.630
And who's gonna give
me good night kisses?

01:53.697 --> 01:56.221
And what if his mom doesn't
know the bedtime story

01:56.288 --> 01:57.775
of Genie Wienie the Baby Beanie

01:57.842 --> 01:59.652
who came out of mom's tummy
and became a perfect boy?

01:59.719 --> 02:01.618
- Listen. Here's what's gonna happen.
- Mm-hmm?

02:01.685 --> 02:03.708
- You'll have dinner with Alex's family.
- Mm-hmm.

02:03.775 --> 02:05.935
If you're lucky, watch
a movie, maybe even PG-13.

02:06.002 --> 02:07.547
- Mm.
- Then, at night,

02:07.614 --> 02:09.285
you'll brush your teeth
with weird toothpaste

02:09.352 --> 02:10.985
- that you've never seen before.
- Mmm.

02:11.051 --> 02:12.495
And after his parents
say good night,

02:12.562 --> 02:13.875
that's when the real fun begins.

02:13.942 --> 02:15.151
Flashlights come out, you gossip,

02:15.218 --> 02:17.590
talk about boys, raid the
fridge for a midnight snack...

02:17.657 --> 02:19.012
I do like midnight snacks.

02:19.079 --> 02:20.319
And they love you.

02:20.386 --> 02:22.010
And before you know it, it's morning.

02:22.077 --> 02:24.516
I guess I can handle that.
Do you think I can call mom

02:24.583 --> 02:26.143
and keep her on the phone
with me the whole time?

02:26.210 --> 02:28.394
- She'd probably do that.
- She would totally do that.

02:28.461 --> 02:30.336
Hmm.
You think he'd let me invite Mom?

02:30.403 --> 02:31.894
I think if you say
her name three times,

02:31.961 --> 02:33.416
she'll appear anywhere.

02:34.739 --> 02:36.297
You want more coffee,
Teddy?

02:36.364 --> 02:38.105
Sounds like you need
some more coffee, Lin.

02:38.172 --> 02:39.429
Yeah, it's true.

02:39.496 --> 02:42.019
Bob kept waking me up last
night with his snoring.

02:42.086 --> 02:43.610
What? Me? Y-You're the one

02:43.677 --> 02:45.602
who's always waking me
up with your snoring.

02:45.669 --> 02:48.082
Oh, please. You sound like
someone's shoving a lawnmower

02:48.149 --> 02:49.647
down a garbage disposal.

02:49.714 --> 02:51.637
Oh, okay.
Does this sound familiar?

02:51.704 --> 02:53.379
"Lin, wake up.
You're snoring."

02:53.446 --> 02:55.412
Because that's what I do
every night.

02:55.479 --> 02:58.196
When I was married, Denise made
me wear an anti-snoring thing.

02:58.263 --> 02:59.575
It was like a big bite plate

02:59.642 --> 03:01.101
that you put in your
mouth when you sleep.

03:01.168 --> 03:04.123
She also made me sit in the car
by myself whenever we ate. Eh...

03:04.190 --> 03:05.699
- Hmm.
- Bob, you should wear

03:05.766 --> 03:06.950
that bite plate thingy.

03:07.017 --> 03:08.497
- You should.
- How about this...

03:08.564 --> 03:11.028
We have a bet, and whoever
snores the most has to wear it.

03:11.095 --> 03:13.265
Fine. But how do we figure
out who snores the most?

03:13.332 --> 03:15.594
I can come over and watch
you guys while you sleep.

03:15.661 --> 03:18.344
- No. No, thanks, Teddy.
- No. No, that shouldn't happen.

03:18.411 --> 03:19.505
- No? -No.
- Yeah, no.

03:19.572 --> 03:21.657
- Absolutely not.
- We should, like, uh, record ourselves.

03:21.724 --> 03:23.692
Oh, yeah,
ou could do that instead.

03:23.759 --> 03:25.185
Hey! I can get you
a recorder.

03:25.252 --> 03:27.153
My next-door neighbor
bootlegs concerts.

03:27.220 --> 03:29.657
He has these tiny recorders
that can record for hours.

03:29.724 --> 03:32.165
Get ready to snooze and
lose, Snory Spelling.

03:32.232 --> 03:35.103
You get ready to lose,
S-Snorma Ray.

03:35.181 --> 03:37.122
Hi, kids.
How was school?

03:38.416 --> 03:39.587
Gene, what's the matter?

03:39.654 --> 03:42.616
Gene got invited to sleep
over at Alex Papasian's house.

03:42.683 --> 03:43.731
And he said yes.

03:43.798 --> 03:45.099
- Really?
- What? Aw.

03:45.166 --> 03:47.333
My little Genie Beanie is
growing up.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.626
Ah, all right,
let's not make this weird, Mom.

03:49.693 --> 03:51.280
Just give me one of your
maxi-pads

03:51.347 --> 03:52.795
to lay my head on
when I fall asleep.

03:52.862 --> 03:54.746
Let me give you a bunch
of good night kisses now

03:54.813 --> 03:56.487
so you won't miss them later.
Come here.

03:56.926 --> 03:58.715
I already miss you, Mom.

03:58.782 --> 04:00.204
Mwah, mwah, I miss you, too.

04:00.271 --> 04:01.643
Mwah, yes, my baby.

04:01.885 --> 04:03.172
- My baby!
- Wait, what...

04:03.239 --> 04:04.562
what'd you say about maxi-pads?

04:04.629 --> 04:05.877
It helps him sleep.
Leave him.

04:05.944 --> 04:07.359
- Yeah.
- When did that start?

04:07.426 --> 04:09.339
Gene takes them in
his backpack to school.

04:09.406 --> 04:10.531
Yeah, I have a bunch.

04:10.598 --> 04:11.934
Definitely needs to stop.

04:12.001 --> 04:14.089
It all feels very healthy,
very normal.

04:14.354 --> 04:16.329
Gene, we're so happy
to have you

04:16.397 --> 04:17.904
sleep over tonight.

04:18.142 --> 04:20.435
D-Donut! Donut! Hush!

04:20.503 --> 04:21.772
Donut, God!

04:21.839 --> 04:23.327
Oh, he's just excited.

04:23.394 --> 04:24.592
That makes one of us.

04:24.659 --> 04:26.932
Honey, can you take Donut?
Please.

04:26.999 --> 04:28.000
Come on, boy.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.194
♪ Come and be a dog with me. ♪

04:30.261 --> 04:31.832
- All right, well, I'm gonna...
- Yep.

04:31.899 --> 04:33.216
- I'm gonna go.
- Sure, sure.

04:33.283 --> 04:35.222
Uh, I'll see you in a half
hour when you come back

04:35.289 --> 04:36.116
to check on me, right?

04:36.183 --> 04:37.641
- You'll-you'll check on me... Yeah.
- Gene. Gene, Gene.

04:37.708 --> 04:39.437
- Gene. It's okay.
- Yeah? Yeah. Uh...

04:39.504 --> 04:40.778
- Look at me. You're gonna do great.
- Mm-hmm.

04:40.845 --> 04:41.946
- Uh-huh.
- All right?

04:42.013 --> 04:43.678
- Mm-hmm. Ah!
- Open your eyes.

04:43.745 --> 04:45.339
All right, I'm gonna go.

04:45.429 --> 04:46.784
It's just a sleepover.

04:46.851 --> 04:49.247
I'll see you...
Stop making that noise.

04:49.325 --> 04:50.871
All right, I'll see you in the morning.

04:50.938 --> 04:53.062
Have fun, have fun. Bye.

04:53.129 --> 04:54.964
Okay, boys, do you want to wash up?

04:55.031 --> 04:56.545
It's almost time for dinner.

04:56.612 --> 04:58.302
I'll be right there. I'm
just gonna press my face

04:58.369 --> 05:00.362
up to the window and watch
my dad drive away.

05:00.429 --> 05:01.514
Okay.

05:01.583 --> 05:03.912
Wow, he wasn't kidding.
He's really leaving.

05:03.979 --> 05:06.214
That son of a bitch is really leaving.

05:06.661 --> 05:08.307
What, uh...

05:08.374 --> 05:09.882
- is this?
- Ugh.

05:09.949 --> 05:12.059
- It's a big plate of farts.
- Alex.

05:12.137 --> 05:15.195
It's steamed salmon, steamed
spinach and steamed potatoes.

05:15.262 --> 05:17.742
- Mmm, well, it sounds delicious to me.
- Mm-hmm.

05:17.809 --> 05:19.878
I'm not used to seeing
the fish part of the fish.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.469
Usually, it's hidden inside
a stick.

05:21.536 --> 05:23.053
Well, we used to eat fish sticks, too,

05:23.120 --> 05:24.896
but we're trying something
new.

05:24.963 --> 05:26.260
We're eating healthy.

05:26.327 --> 05:29.374
What... now,
we eat healthy and happy.

05:29.441 --> 05:32.112
- Ew!
- We eat healthy and it makes us happy.

05:32.179 --> 05:35.815
- Alex!
- Happy. Happy! Happy family!

05:36.278 --> 05:38.585
Uh, I love it here!

05:38.652 --> 05:39.875
Thanks for this, Teddy.

05:39.942 --> 05:42.705
Yeah, my neighbor said it can
record for up to six hours.

05:42.772 --> 05:46.328
He also made me buy this CD
of a Sting concert from 2003.

05:46.395 --> 05:47.889
- Oh. Well, I'm gonna get going.
- You want to sit down?

05:47.956 --> 05:48.839
Have something to drink?

05:48.906 --> 05:50.045
Sorry, I've, uh...

05:50.112 --> 05:51.555
Oh, yeah, no. You should go.

05:51.622 --> 05:52.824
You have a family to get home to.

05:52.891 --> 05:54.195
I'll stay here, listen to Sting

05:54.262 --> 05:55.918
with the cheese and
the crackers I put out

05:55.985 --> 05:57.910
in anticipation of
your visit. No big deal.

05:57.977 --> 06:00.118
Um, I-I guess I could
stay for another minute.

06:00.185 --> 06:01.672
- All right, have a seat.
- Yep.

06:01.739 --> 06:03.496
You can have that seat,
and I'll sit over here.

06:03.563 --> 06:04.897
- Oh! That's uh...
- Right?

06:04.964 --> 06:06.859
- That's a, that's a firm couch.
- Y-Yeah...

06:06.926 --> 06:08.441
Well, it doesn't get used a ton.

06:08.508 --> 06:10.445
Want... put a cushion down?
Hold on.

06:10.512 --> 06:12.457
There's a little cat fur on this pillow.

06:12.524 --> 06:14.221
Who got a cat around here?
Not me.

06:14.288 --> 06:16.426
- Where'd that cat fur come from?
- Yeah. That's...

06:16.493 --> 06:18.699
Uh... -That's what happens when
you get pillows off the street.

06:18.766 --> 06:20.496
What, are you gonna throw
out a perfectly good pillow?

06:20.563 --> 06:21.545
Yep.

06:21.614 --> 06:22.799
How's that? That better?

06:22.866 --> 06:24.187
- Yeah, that's fine. That's good.
- Is that good?

06:24.254 --> 06:25.322
- Thank you.
- Okay.

06:25.389 --> 06:27.670
Uh, how was your day? At work.

06:27.737 --> 06:30.527
Well, it wa... it was a good
day, and then it was this.

06:30.594 --> 06:31.917
Uh... Sting?

06:31.984 --> 06:33.543
- It does.
- Want to listen to Sting?

06:33.610 --> 06:35.999
Oh. All right, well, I'm
definitely gonna go now. - Okay.

06:36.066 --> 06:39.048
<i>Cacti grow in different
shapes and sizes,</i>

06:39.115 --> 06:41.939
<i>and they have developed many
adaptations to conserve water.</i>

06:42.006 --> 06:44.320
Is this PG-13 by any chance?

06:44.387 --> 06:46.568
If PG stands for "Poop Garbage."

06:46.635 --> 06:48.709
Alex! Let's watch
the documentary.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.381
- Ugh.
- Shh.

07:00.329 --> 07:02.766
- Okay, boys, good night.
- Good night.

07:02.833 --> 07:04.695
Sweet dreams. Kisses, huh?

07:04.762 --> 07:06.362
M-Mwah, mwah, mwah.

07:06.429 --> 07:07.819
You're not my Mom!
Oh, my God, oh, my god,

07:07.886 --> 07:09.046
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

07:09.113 --> 07:10.729
S-Sweet dreams.

07:10.796 --> 07:12.957
I hate this, I hate this, I hate this.

07:13.024 --> 07:14.074
This is a living hell.

07:14.141 --> 07:15.779
- What was that?
- Ah, oh, you're awake?

07:15.846 --> 07:17.407
Yeah. I think my parents are
in bed.

07:17.474 --> 07:18.521
Yeah.

07:18.588 --> 07:20.545
So, it's showtime.

07:20.612 --> 07:21.842
I don't want to watch it.

07:21.909 --> 07:22.951
No, no, my friend.

07:23.018 --> 07:24.832
Put on your shoes
and follow me.

07:24.899 --> 07:26.545
I didn't know we were
bringing backpacks to...

07:26.612 --> 07:28.687
Shh!:
Use your whisper voice.

07:28.859 --> 07:30.051
Right. Sorry.

07:30.118 --> 07:32.332
Okay, I did a dry run of this
yesterday.

07:32.399 --> 07:34.306
The last few steps are really creaky.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.054
We're gonna have to
climb over the bannister,

07:36.121 --> 07:38.364
go down the other side,
so we don't make noise.

07:38.431 --> 07:39.541
Okay.

07:39.610 --> 07:41.168
- Do as I do.
- I will.

07:41.235 --> 07:42.738
- Nice and easy.
- Okay.

07:42.805 --> 07:45.404
- Think of yourself as...
- We're Shaolin monks.

07:45.471 --> 07:47.668
Yeah, I was gonna say J.Lo was, like,

07:47.735 --> 07:49.106
dancing around the lasers.

07:49.173 --> 07:50.995
Wait, is that the
movie with Sean Connery,

07:51.062 --> 07:53.443
- and they're robbers or something?
- Yes, yes, yes.

07:53.510 --> 07:55.232
- Gene, yes.
- Okay, okay. Yeah, okay.

07:55.299 --> 07:57.545
Good, good, good.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:58.221 --> 07:59.576
- Okay.
- No, thanks.

07:59.643 --> 08:01.162
I'm more of a wet food guy.

08:01.229 --> 08:03.116
Oh, no, these are for Donut.

08:03.719 --> 08:05.834
It's so he doesn't bark
and wake up my parents.

08:05.901 --> 08:07.587
But I like how open-minded you are.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.513
- Thank you.
- All right, perfect.

08:09.580 --> 08:11.004
Now let's go before he finishes.

08:11.071 --> 08:13.079
But the fridge is over there.

08:13.490 --> 08:14.864
Uh, what's going on?

08:14.931 --> 08:16.453
- We're running away.
- What?

08:16.520 --> 08:18.292
- I mean, well, walking away.
- We can walk away.

08:18.359 --> 08:20.689
- No big deal. Let's walk.
- You can't run away!

08:20.756 --> 08:22.568
We were in the middle
of my first sleepover.

08:22.635 --> 08:25.149
I was told we were gonna
gossip and talk about boys.

08:25.216 --> 08:27.277
Alex! Oh, my God, you walk fast

08:27.344 --> 08:29.418
for someone
so horrible at running!

08:31.723 --> 08:33.384
Alex, you can't run away.

08:33.451 --> 08:35.427
Well, I can't live there anymore.

08:35.494 --> 08:38.042
Why? Your parents seem
okay-ish.

08:38.109 --> 08:40.458
I mean, they shouldn't be
allowed near food, but...

08:40.525 --> 08:42.447
I know! That... I know. A month ago,

08:42.514 --> 08:45.249
my parents watched a documentary
about how sugar "was evil."

08:45.316 --> 08:47.606
Next day, they threw out
all the sugar in our house,

08:47.673 --> 08:48.817
and put me on a diet.

08:48.884 --> 08:50.626
Monsters! I mean, hmm...

08:50.693 --> 08:53.211
No, no, you had it right the
first time. They are monsters.

08:53.278 --> 08:55.908
And I'm done living with
their dumb diet meals.

08:55.975 --> 08:58.208
Well, I don't want to
run away from your house.

08:58.275 --> 08:59.488
I'm in my jammies.

08:59.555 --> 09:01.097
My nighttime jammies.

09:01.164 --> 09:03.062
If you don't want to run away, fine.

09:03.129 --> 09:05.882
Go back, wake up my parents,
and get me into trouble,

09:05.949 --> 09:07.668
which would be snitching.

09:07.735 --> 09:10.538
Uh... puts kind of a bad spin
on that.

09:10.605 --> 09:11.875
Then come with me.

09:11.942 --> 09:14.387
Like gym class, but for
the rest of our lives.

09:14.454 --> 09:16.714
Listen, I built a cabin in the woods.

09:16.781 --> 09:18.245
It's stocked with food.

09:18.312 --> 09:19.350
Real food.

09:19.419 --> 09:20.774
A cabin in the woods?

09:20.841 --> 09:23.500
- Didn't you see Cabin in the Woods?
- No.

09:23.567 --> 09:27.871
Me neither. But the music
for the ads was terrifying!

09:28.345 --> 09:29.784
Tina, Louise, it's late.

09:29.851 --> 09:32.013
- You two need to go to bed.
- Well, we can't.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.036
We're helping you guys
record yourselves sleeping,

09:34.103 --> 09:35.825
just like every kid
in every family does.

09:35.892 --> 09:38.422
I'm in charge of tape.
Anyone want some Scotch?

09:38.489 --> 09:41.344
Actually, this is masking tape,
but I really wanted to say that.

09:41.411 --> 09:42.794
I thought all adults snored.

09:42.861 --> 09:44.652
It's just the sound of them dying.

09:44.719 --> 09:47.355
Maybe, you know, let nature
take its course, right?

09:47.422 --> 09:48.978
Aw, we're dying. All right.

09:49.045 --> 09:50.320
Come on, you two. Off to bed.

09:50.387 --> 09:52.678
Your dad and I have to fall
asleep and snore at each other.

09:52.745 --> 09:55.144
- Come on.
- You guys have a beautiful marriage.

09:55.211 --> 09:57.246
It has its moments.

09:57.780 --> 09:59.048
What is this?

09:59.115 --> 10:00.570
Some kind of animal trap?

10:00.637 --> 10:01.684
No.

10:01.751 --> 10:03.095
Welcome to my cabin.

10:03.162 --> 10:06.084
I call it Alex's
Alpine Oasis for Boys.

10:06.151 --> 10:07.183
Hmm.

10:07.318 --> 10:09.074
You know that thing
where a place looks small

10:09.141 --> 10:11.688
from the outside, but
inside, it's enormous?

10:11.755 --> 10:12.727
Mm-hmm.

10:12.794 --> 10:14.619
That's what I want this to become.

10:14.686 --> 10:16.716
How long were you
planning on staying here?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.857
Well, I think we have
enough food for a month.

10:18.924 --> 10:21.383
Maybe two, if we conserve
these sugar packets.

10:21.450 --> 10:23.168
- A month? Alex!
- What?

10:23.235 --> 10:24.857
This is barely enough food

10:24.924 --> 10:26.568
to get us through the next few minutes

10:26.635 --> 10:28.614
while I stress-eat and
convince you to go back home.

10:28.681 --> 10:29.742
I'm not going home.

10:29.809 --> 10:31.534
But yeah, let's stress-eat.

10:31.601 --> 10:33.082
Mmm! Oh, oh, oh.

10:33.149 --> 10:34.509
Hello, Shuggie.

10:34.576 --> 10:35.804
Sweet, sweet Shuggie.

10:35.871 --> 10:38.044
So, where are we supposed to sleep?

10:38.111 --> 10:39.582
There are no beds in here.

10:39.649 --> 10:41.096
Well, who needs beds
when you have

10:41.163 --> 10:43.023
these cool black sleeping bags?

10:43.090 --> 10:44.128
Check them out.

10:44.195 --> 10:45.599
Whoa-oh, coming at you.

10:45.666 --> 10:46.998
These are for garbage.

10:47.065 --> 10:49.560
Well, y... but, yeah,
but they're bags, right?

10:49.627 --> 10:50.961
Look, look: here you go,
here you go.

10:51.028 --> 10:52.655
Slip into this little guy.

10:52.722 --> 10:55.218
Uh, odor protection and drawstrings.

10:55.285 --> 10:56.358
Nice and snug.

10:56.425 --> 10:58.339
Zip it up tight.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.312
In a garbage bag in
the middle of the woods.

11:00.379 --> 11:01.997
My horoscope was right.

11:02.064 --> 11:03.266
All right, you ready?

11:03.333 --> 11:04.579
- Ready.
- Okay.

11:04.646 --> 11:06.171
- It's recording.
- Good night, Linda.

11:06.238 --> 11:07.867
- Why are you talking like that?
- I don't know.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.839
I guess 'cause... So it's
clear for the recording.

11:09.906 --> 11:12.065
- You sound weird. Just relax.
- Okay, all right.

11:12.132 --> 11:13.555
- Good night.
- Still weird. That's not...

11:13.622 --> 11:15.123
Just... let's just go to sleep.

11:15.190 --> 11:16.537
You're gonna lose.

11:16.638 --> 11:18.553
What? Did you just say,
"You're... you're gonna lose?"

11:18.620 --> 11:19.943
- I didn't say anything.
- Yes, you did.

11:20.010 --> 11:22.091
We're recording ourselves.
I can play it back for you.

11:22.158 --> 11:24.162
I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:24.229 --> 11:25.420
- Snore loser.
- What?

11:25.487 --> 11:26.629
What? Nothing!

11:26.696 --> 11:28.232
Night. You're dead.

11:28.299 --> 11:29.688
Oh, my God.

11:30.817 --> 11:32.619
How many of those have you had?

11:32.686 --> 11:33.904
I don't know, I stopped counting.

11:33.971 --> 11:35.582
I hear my heartbeat. Do
you hear my heartbeat?

11:35.649 --> 11:37.841
Maybe we should conserve
the rest of the food.

11:37.908 --> 11:39.998
Yeah, good idea,
good idea. Good idea.

11:40.065 --> 11:42.823
Uh, I think I just felt a raindrop.

11:42.890 --> 11:43.963
- Really?
- Ah!

11:44.030 --> 11:46.561
Did you mean to leave a
gaping hole in the ceiling?

11:46.628 --> 11:48.304
Uh, that's a skylight.

11:48.371 --> 11:50.355
We're getting wet.

11:50.422 --> 11:51.590
Okay, look, look, look.

11:51.657 --> 11:53.337
Everybody just start thinking.

11:53.404 --> 11:55.374
We can pull our garbage
bags over our heads.

11:55.456 --> 11:58.144
That'll keep us dry.
Drawstrings, activate. Go!

11:58.211 --> 11:59.641
Um, I don't think that's a great idea.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.032
You know, because of breathing.

12:01.099 --> 12:02.423
Oh, right. Yes, yes, yes.

12:02.490 --> 12:04.640
See?
This is why we're a great team.

12:04.707 --> 12:08.524
I have sugar, and you...
you know about breathing.

12:08.591 --> 12:10.254
Is it getting wetter in here?

12:10.321 --> 12:14.311
Ah! Alex's Alpine Oasis for
Boys has turned out exactly to be

12:14.378 --> 12:15.918
as well-constructed
as I thought it was!

12:15.985 --> 12:18.005
Which is not well-constructed.

12:20.358 --> 12:21.924
Are we done running away?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.588
Can we go back to
your house now?

12:23.655 --> 12:25.400
I told you,
I'm never going back there.

12:25.467 --> 12:26.629
No, you're right.

12:26.696 --> 12:28.421
We should stay here.
This is perfect.

12:28.488 --> 12:30.867
I forget, have I thanked
you yet for inviting me over?

12:30.934 --> 12:32.138
Oh, I know what we can do.

12:32.205 --> 12:33.516
We'll hitchhike to the airport

12:33.583 --> 12:35.347
and pretend we're
ambassadors from Dubai.

12:35.414 --> 12:37.032
And then they'll let us fly to Dubai.

12:37.099 --> 12:38.990
Next thing you know,
we're in Dubai, baby.

12:39.057 --> 12:40.594
Okay, we could do that.

12:40.661 --> 12:43.420
- Or, what if we went to my house?
- No way.

12:43.487 --> 12:45.165
Your parents will call my parents.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.903
Bad plan. We're going with Dubai.

12:46.970 --> 12:48.723
Listen, we won't tell
my parents we're there.

12:48.790 --> 12:50.387
We'll get my sisters to let us in.

12:50.454 --> 12:53.052
- They'll know what to do.
- Eh, I don't know.

12:53.119 --> 12:55.251
Come on, at least we
can get out of the rain.

12:55.318 --> 12:57.630
Fine, but I feel like you're
being really overcritical

12:57.697 --> 12:59.620
of Alex's Alpine Oasis for Boys.

12:59.687 --> 13:02.745
I mean, this could have
been a place of learning.

13:16.936 --> 13:18.063
Gene?

13:18.132 --> 13:19.455
What are you guys doing
down there?

13:19.522 --> 13:20.546
Wait, is this a dream?

13:20.613 --> 13:22.484
I wish. Now, don't tell Mom and Dad,

13:22.551 --> 13:24.742
but Alex ran away from
home, and I went with him,

13:24.809 --> 13:26.534
and now
we're standing here in the rain,

13:26.601 --> 13:28.832
and Alex has had a lot of sugar.

13:28.899 --> 13:30.963
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep,
yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep,

13:31.030 --> 13:32.310
yep, yep, yep, yeah.

13:32.377 --> 13:33.289
So,

13:33.358 --> 13:35.436
the sleepover took
a weird turn, huh?

13:35.503 --> 13:37.186
- Yes. Yes.
- No. No.

13:37.253 --> 13:39.050
So, are you coming in, or...

13:39.117 --> 13:40.153
We can't go inside.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.956
We can't let Mom and
Dad know about this.

13:42.023 --> 13:43.060
But they would love this.

13:43.127 --> 13:44.319
They're so good at telling us

13:44.386 --> 13:45.506
to change out of wet clothes.

13:45.573 --> 13:47.839
Yeah, but they're gonna
want to call Alex's parents,

13:47.906 --> 13:49.570
and we're not doing
that, for some reason.

13:49.637 --> 13:51.929
- It's a pretty good reason.
- It's not a good reason.

13:51.996 --> 13:54.184
- It is a good reason.
- It is not a good reason.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.536
- It's a great reason, Gene.
- I don't think it's

13:55.603 --> 13:56.945
- a good reason, I've seen reason...
- It's a great reason!

13:57.012 --> 13:58.806
- No.
- I could listen to this forever,

13:58.873 --> 14:00.962
but, uh, we'll get the
keys to the restaurant

14:01.029 --> 14:01.976
and be right back.

14:02.043 --> 14:03.647
Great idea.
Bring dry clothes for us.

14:03.714 --> 14:04.744
Oh, and nothing fussy.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.514
I hate buckles, buttons, and bows.

14:06.581 --> 14:07.864
Maybe just a tapered jean,

14:07.931 --> 14:09.991
or if you've got
sweatpants, that'd be great.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.987
Lin. Lin, wake up.

14:13.054 --> 14:14.389
What? What happened?
What happened?

14:14.456 --> 14:17.159
You were snoring, and
it woke me up, so I win.

14:17.226 --> 14:18.444
Just because you woke up

14:18.511 --> 14:20.017
doesn't mean you weren't snoring.

14:20.084 --> 14:22.935
Maybe you woke yourself
up, Snora the Explorer.

14:23.002 --> 14:25.053
All right, well, let's
listen to the recording,

14:25.120 --> 14:27.229
uh, George Snoreman.

14:27.296 --> 14:28.612
Okay, let's.

14:28.679 --> 14:31.451
Ooh, maybe I confessed
something fun in my sleep,

14:31.518 --> 14:34.109
like I'm really a Russian
agent, like, like Felicity.

14:34.176 --> 14:35.146
Good night, Linda.

14:35.213 --> 14:36.954
I told you that sounded weird.

14:37.105 --> 14:38.239
Fast-forwarding.

14:38.306 --> 14:39.502
Oh, here we go.

14:39.569 --> 14:41.364
Is that me? Which one's me?

14:41.431 --> 14:44.285
Uh... that one. Oh, oh, oh...

14:44.352 --> 14:45.650
may-maybe that one.

14:45.717 --> 14:47.012
- Oh, that's you.
- You.

14:47.182 --> 14:49.319
- You. No, no, that's you.
- No...

14:49.789 --> 14:51.119
Okay, that's me.

14:51.186 --> 14:52.769
- Yeah, that was you.
- Yep.

14:52.836 --> 14:54.735
Hmm, toss-up.

14:54.802 --> 14:56.597
Ugh, what is wrong with us?

14:56.664 --> 14:59.060
Okay, we got you guys
tucked away down here.

14:59.127 --> 15:00.506
Out of sight, out of mind.

15:00.573 --> 15:01.625
What happens now?

15:01.692 --> 15:03.710
Uh... I don't know.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.143
Peanut butter.

15:05.210 --> 15:07.297
Oh, and the real kind,
not that natural stuff

15:07.364 --> 15:09.007
with four inches of oil on top.

15:09.571 --> 15:11.042
It's nice down here.

15:11.109 --> 15:13.564
Gene, you know what we should do?
We should live here.

15:13.631 --> 15:15.598
I do live here. Aah!

15:15.665 --> 15:18.065
- You are terrible at running away!
- What?

15:18.132 --> 15:19.733
And you shouldn't have run
away in the first place.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.687
Alex, sometimes you have to toughen up

15:21.754 --> 15:23.401
and do stuff you don't want to do.

15:23.468 --> 15:24.456
Like a no-sugar diet

15:24.523 --> 15:26.248
or a sleepover at someone else's house.

15:26.315 --> 15:27.991
And maybe, hopefully,
those things will

15:28.058 --> 15:29.417
make us stronger in some way.

15:29.484 --> 15:31.530
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

15:33.724 --> 15:36.655
Oh, my God, you're right.

15:37.232 --> 15:39.527
Wow, I've never seen someone cry

15:39.594 --> 15:41.608
and eat peanut butter at the same time.

15:41.675 --> 15:43.436
It's a little hard to watch.

15:43.503 --> 15:45.429
Okay, what do I do?

15:45.496 --> 15:47.189
You could go home.

15:47.256 --> 15:50.538
No. No, I can't. I'll get in trouble.

15:50.639 --> 15:52.405
And then I'll get punished.

15:52.514 --> 15:56.515
My parents let me have four
ounces of ice cream a month.

15:56.617 --> 15:59.361
They're gonna take that away from me.
It's the one thing I have.

15:59.428 --> 16:03.564
Okay, kooky idea...
What if you un-run away?

16:03.631 --> 16:07.168
- What do you mean?
- What if we sneak back into your house

16:07.235 --> 16:08.503
before your parents wake up?

16:08.570 --> 16:10.271
Then they'll never know you were gone.

16:10.338 --> 16:11.639
It'll be like it never happened.

16:11.706 --> 16:13.096
But the doors are locked.

16:13.163 --> 16:14.898
My sister can pick locks.

16:14.965 --> 16:17.428
I mean, I'm better at
locks on Tina's room,

16:17.495 --> 16:19.488
Tina's drawer, Tina's diary...

16:19.555 --> 16:21.506
- Wait, what?
- But I can try a front door.

16:21.573 --> 16:23.233
Ugh. But what about Donut?

16:23.300 --> 16:25.471
I mean, he'll hear us and
then bark

16:25.538 --> 16:26.733
and wake up my parents.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.974
I might have an idea for that.

16:29.045 --> 16:31.334
Alex, we're sneaking
back into your house,

16:31.401 --> 16:33.040
going to sleep, and waking up

16:33.107 --> 16:36.882
to a healthy, bland breakfast
that probably involves muesli.

16:37.102 --> 16:38.280
Okay.

16:38.355 --> 16:41.164
Is Donut your brother? Just curious.

16:43.516 --> 16:46.746
Okay, here's the plan.
Tina's gonna distract Donut...

16:46.813 --> 16:48.747
- The dog.
- Right. The dog.

16:48.814 --> 16:50.073
And Louise will pick the lock,

16:50.140 --> 16:52.089
and Alex and I will stand
here and try not to panic.

16:52.156 --> 16:53.791
Not panicking. Not
panicking. I'm not panicking.

16:53.858 --> 16:55.173
Good job. You're doing great.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.885
I am doing great.
This is great. This is fun. - Yeah.

16:56.952 --> 16:58.075
- This is a good idea.
- Oh, my God.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.317
I wonder what you'd be
like if you were panicking.

17:01.294 --> 17:02.601
That is funny.

17:02.668 --> 17:04.530
Tina, get in position.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.494
Ah, squishy.

17:07.425 --> 17:10.093
Okay. Here goes nothing.

17:11.612 --> 17:13.691
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

17:13.758 --> 17:15.073
He stopped barking.

17:15.140 --> 17:17.277
Hope he finds my hand. Oh, wow.
Yeah, he totally found my hand.

17:17.344 --> 17:18.664
Are you sure this isn't your brother?

17:18.731 --> 17:20.145
People. Hush. Please.

17:20.212 --> 17:22.473
Little girl. Big lock.
Need to concentrate.

17:22.685 --> 17:24.550
Is that you? That's definitely you.

17:24.645 --> 17:27.383
- I can't... I can't tell.
- Yeah, it is hard to tell.

17:27.450 --> 17:28.781
Quiet. Don't wake up Mom and Dad.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.735
- Wait. Did you just hear Tina?
- I don't know.

17:30.802 --> 17:32.044
- I heard something.
- No, no, no.

17:32.111 --> 17:33.425
They're not gonna wake up.

17:33.492 --> 17:34.914
They're in their angry rhino phase.

17:34.981 --> 17:36.927
- Oh, yeah, of course.
- Hmm.

17:38.230 --> 17:39.717
Oh, that is you. Wow.

17:39.784 --> 17:40.860
What do you think the kids
were doing?

17:40.927 --> 17:42.201
Don't change the subject.

17:42.268 --> 17:44.239
You just started honking
on a whole nother level.

17:44.306 --> 17:45.814
I'm winning this thing.

17:46.032 --> 17:47.339
Oh, that's me.

17:47.406 --> 17:49.178
Ugh. We're both disgusting.

17:49.245 --> 17:50.579
So what now what do we do?

17:50.646 --> 17:52.193
Is it a tie? Is the bet off?

17:52.260 --> 17:54.023
No one wears the thing
on the snoring thing?

17:54.090 --> 17:56.162
- What do we do?
- I'm fine with that if you are.

17:56.229 --> 17:58.022
You know what?
Yeah, works for me.

17:58.089 --> 17:59.405
Can we just go back to sleep?

17:59.472 --> 18:01.184
Yeah. I guess. Yeah.

18:02.872 --> 18:04.696
- I can't sleep.
- Yeah, me neither.

18:04.763 --> 18:06.720
- It's too quiet now.
- Yeah, I know.

18:06.787 --> 18:08.935
I think I'm not used to you
not snoring

18:09.002 --> 18:10.173
in the middle of the night.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.376
Same here. I guess
you're my white noise.

18:12.443 --> 18:14.052
My disgusting white noise.

18:14.119 --> 18:16.085
- I guess you're mine, too.
- Aw.

18:16.152 --> 18:18.298
I mean, maybe I woke up
because you stopped snoring,

18:18.365 --> 18:21.603
- not because you started.
- Maybe. Should we turn it back on?

18:21.670 --> 18:24.030
- Really?
- Yeah. It's either that or pills.

18:24.097 --> 18:25.472
Okay.

18:34.787 --> 18:36.854
- Mmm.
- I'm running out of peanut butter.

18:36.921 --> 18:38.115
Ugh. Can you hurry up?

18:38.182 --> 18:40.240
It doesn't take this long
to pick locks in the movies.

18:40.307 --> 18:42.724
- Well, you try it, Houdini.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:42.791 --> 18:44.048
I got out of hand, and I'm sorry.

18:44.115 --> 18:45.161
I told you it's possible

18:45.228 --> 18:46.991
I might not even be able to open...

18:47.432 --> 18:49.013
I'm the best.

18:49.174 --> 18:50.903
- That's it.
- That a boy.

18:50.970 --> 18:52.391
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Good dog. -Good boy, Donut.

18:52.458 --> 18:53.457
Okay, we're in.

18:53.524 --> 18:57.173
We know. Now let's get upstairs
before anyone hears us.

18:58.843 --> 19:00.577
They have a fun way of going up stairs.

19:00.779 --> 19:02.735
- What is that... parkour?
- Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.

19:02.802 --> 19:04.476
Wait. There's someone in the kitchen.

19:04.568 --> 19:05.740
Oh, my God.

19:05.807 --> 19:08.218
Oh, my dear, darling, ice cream.

19:08.285 --> 19:09.512
Are you kidding me?

19:09.579 --> 19:11.349
- Should we join her?
- What?

19:11.416 --> 19:13.503
No, no. She can't know
that we're not in bed.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.535
Right, right, but every diet has room

19:15.602 --> 19:17.333
for a little midnight kitchen sneakin'.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.886
You should try it yourself
sometime.

19:18.953 --> 19:20.224
Huh. Yeah.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.155
See? This is why
we have sleepovers.

19:22.269 --> 19:23.801
I'm never coming back here.

19:23.869 --> 19:25.414
How long do I have to keep
doing this?

19:25.481 --> 19:27.503
You know what? Let's rub a bunch
of peanut butter on the floor

19:27.570 --> 19:29.578
- and just get out of here.
- Okay. Bye, Donut.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.864
I'll never forget you. Don't change.

19:31.931 --> 19:34.379
- We did it.
- Yeah. You know,

19:34.446 --> 19:37.280
I think I'm crashing
from all that sug... ah...

19:38.054 --> 19:39.567
Oh, God. This is it.

19:39.634 --> 19:41.373
This is the scary part.

19:41.909 --> 19:43.124
Think of happy things.

19:43.191 --> 19:47.454
Mom smell, Dad smell, aioli,
Rachael Ray, Luke Cage.

19:48.391 --> 19:50.690
- Good morning, boys!
- It's morning?

19:50.757 --> 19:52.456
- I fell asleep?
- Oh.

19:52.523 --> 19:54.743
Do you say that every
morning? That's cute.

19:54.810 --> 19:56.785
- How'd you boys sleep?
- Like lambs.

19:56.864 --> 19:58.959
Like little, sugarless lambs.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.552
How about you, Mother?

20:00.619 --> 20:01.728
Very well, thank you.

20:01.795 --> 20:03.561
Breakfast is on the table.

20:03.628 --> 20:05.610
♪ Who likes muesli? ♪

20:05.677 --> 20:08.059
Ugh. ♪ No one. ♪

20:08.160 --> 20:09.973
Thanks for the recorder, Teddy.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.568
Yeah, glad to help,
or not help, I guess.

20:12.635 --> 20:14.071
- No clear winner, huh?
- Nope.

20:14.138 --> 20:16.205
But definitely two clear losers.

20:16.272 --> 20:17.794
Who? Oh, us.

20:17.861 --> 20:19.529
Very funny, Louise.

20:19.658 --> 20:21.506
They're back. Oh, they're back!

20:21.573 --> 20:23.586
There's my little sleepover star.

20:23.689 --> 20:25.264
How was it?
Did you have fun?

20:25.331 --> 20:27.606
It was bad, then really bad,
then wet,

20:27.700 --> 20:29.381
then suspenseful, and then it was over.

20:29.448 --> 20:31.306
Like my second, fourth and fifth kisses.

20:31.373 --> 20:32.544
Hmm. Uh-uh.

20:32.629 --> 20:33.854
Well, you did it.

20:33.921 --> 20:36.117
Now you never have to sleep
outside the house again.

20:36.184 --> 20:38.564
Not when you go to college,
or when you graduate college,

20:38.631 --> 20:41.119
- or even when you get married.
- Yay! I love you, Mom.

20:41.186 --> 20:42.189
I love you.

20:42.256 --> 20:45.573
- Mwah...
- Mwah...

20:45.679 --> 20:47.636
Does anyone else feel
like a third wheel?

20:47.703 --> 20:48.445
Little bit.

20:48.512 --> 20:49.642
- I love you.
- Let's throw stuff at them.

20:49.709 --> 20:50.806
