BOY: Hey, Johnny, check out your grandpa.

00:08.320 --> 00:09.640
JOHNNY: Yeah. He's the best.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.440
That's okay, Jakey. We didn't want any.

00:16.640 --> 00:18.960
(CHUCKLES) Sorry, brah.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.600
Oh, hey, there it is. There.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.840
Oh, see, I told you it was real, dude.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.560
Hey, Johnny, tell him the story.

00:35.040 --> 00:39.200
Oh. Well, it happened a long time ago.
My dad was still a baby.

00:39.280 --> 00:42.040
There was a small plane
that crashed over there past the reef.

00:42.640 --> 00:46.280
Grandpa paddled out there,
he found those people barely alive.

00:49.840 --> 00:52.160
Yeah, but I thought that was just a story
someone made up for the tourist books.

00:52.240 --> 00:56.920
Oh, no. For real, dude. That's how
he got his name. Johnny Tsunami.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.920
Those were the raddest waves ever.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.680
And he rode in with those people
on his board. Saved all three of 'em.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.440
Eh, Pono, you never get tired
of looking at a messed-up old book.

01:08.240 --> 01:11.320
-Can I show Jake the medallion?
-Yeah, all right! Can we see it?

01:11.400 --> 01:13.480
-You know where it is.
-Yeah!

01:28.040 --> 01:31.200
The Tsunami medallion.
Given to the best surfer in Hawaii.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.000
-Right, Grandpa?
-Well, I don't know about the best.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.640
But it's been handed down for years

01:36.720 --> 01:39.560
to the person who best exemplifies
what surfing is.

01:40.680 --> 01:44.680
Respect for nature. Courage to surf.
Brotherhood.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.320
Go and win.

01:46.400 --> 01:50.560
And maybe, some day, if you're lucky,
one of you might win it.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.240
It's cool.

01:58.560 --> 02:03.280
COMMENTATOR: <i>The young Johnny Kapahaala</i>
<i>snags yet another wave during the finals.</i>

02:03.360 --> 02:07.960
<i>He is the only Am from the semis</i>
<i>to make it to the finals.</i>

02:08.040 --> 02:09.720
<i>Not surprising when you consider the fact</i>

02:09.800 --> 02:13.720
<i>he is the grandson</i>

02:13.960 --> 02:16.480

02:20.440 --> 02:23.360
-Look now. There's Johnny.
-MEL: Hey, he looks good.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.600
Yeah!

02:29.120 --> 02:32.160
Hey, Johnny Tsunami. How is it, brah?

02:32.320 --> 02:33.640
Hey, Big Mike.

02:33.720 --> 02:37.120
Came by to make sure the tadpole
carries on the family's good name, eh?

02:37.200 --> 02:40.800
-How are they doing?
-(LAUGHS) Aww, looks kinda close.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.360
Think your boy's gonna need
a ten-point ride here.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.640
Hey, Mike, how much time?

02:44.720 --> 02:46.840
-Uh, 20 seconds.
-20 seconds?

02:46.920 --> 02:50.400
-He's never gonna make it.
-Dude, don't send him the negative vibe.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.720
It's okay, Jake, you get plenty of time.

02:54.280 --> 02:57.440
There's a set,
but he's only got 10 seconds left.

02:57.520 --> 03:00.080
He's got to get up before that horn blows
or he's out.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.560
ANNOUNCER: Has priority over...
(CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

03:02.920 --> 03:05.600
-That's too big.
-No way, that's perfect.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.920
(HORN BLOWS)

03:12.000 --> 03:13.280
Just made the wave.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.880
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

03:18.880 --> 03:20.720
It's almost closed out.

03:22.880 --> 03:23.880
He's gonna get worked.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.440
-ALL: Jake!
-Sorry.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.080
Come on, where is he?

03:37.040 --> 03:38.040
Right there.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.320
(ALL CHEERING)

03:57.760 --> 03:59.320
Yeah! Good job!

03:59.600 --> 04:02.120
Dude, that was insane.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.840
-Thanks, guys.
-Yeah, dude.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.880
Hey, Jake kept saying
that you got slammed.

04:06.960 --> 04:08.320
I didn't say that, Eddie.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.120
It's okay, Jake, I thought I was too.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.280
See? He thought he was too.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.600
BOTH: Hey!

04:13.680 --> 04:15.960
Hey Mom. Grandpa. You guys came.

04:16.400 --> 04:20.000
Pono. When was the last time
I missed a major surfing contest?

04:20.080 --> 04:22.000
Especially one with my grandson in it, eh?

04:22.960 --> 04:24.160
Hey where's Pop?

04:24.600 --> 04:28.080
Uh... He had to work
but I know he wanted to be here, honey.

04:28.760 --> 04:29.760
Oh.

04:30.080 --> 04:31.720
It don't matter. (LAUGHS)

04:47.480 --> 04:49.000
No<i> aloha</i>  for the old man?

04:49.400 --> 04:51.840
Oh. Hey, Pop, I...
I didn't want to interrupt.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.600
I heard you had a good day.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.920
Oh yeah, there were some rad waves.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.200
Sorry you couldn't make it. Again.

05:03.960 --> 05:06.440
Unfortunately, I was stuck here,

05:06.520 --> 05:09.760
writing some rad code
for the Net Study project.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.200
I'll try to get there next time.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.000
Hey, um... So, Net Study.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.960
That's the one where you
hook up all the schools

05:22.400 --> 05:24.400
and they like, share
the same files and stuff?

05:24.520 --> 05:25.520
That's the one.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.520
You want to see how it works?

05:29.600 --> 05:30.560
Sure.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.920
Since we're only connected
here on the island,

05:34.600 --> 05:36.920
let's go with something local.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.080
PETE: $34,000?

05:43.160 --> 05:44.480
Wow!

05:44.560 --> 05:46.600
You'd think these guys
would be earning a lot more than that.

05:47.320 --> 05:50.600
Real subtle, Pop. You know what?
No matter what you say, I'm not giving up.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.560
I'm just laying out the facts.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.320
Maybe it'll save you
from ending up like my father.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.720
Why wouldn't I want to be like Grandpa?
That would be awesome.

06:00.640 --> 06:03.520
-You know what would be even more awesome?
-What?

06:03.600 --> 06:07.560
If some day,
when you decided to have a family,

06:07.640 --> 06:10.160
you'd have a job
that would allow you to support them

06:10.240 --> 06:12.000
and be there for them
when they needed you.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.320
I'll let you get back to work.

06:17.600 --> 06:18.920
Hey, kiddo.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.160
You hungry? I saved you some dinner.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.240
Nah. I already had some at Grandpa's.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.320
I'm just going to go upstairs
and do my homework.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.800
Hey, listen...

06:28.560 --> 06:31.800
I'm really proud of you.
You did a great job today.

06:31.880 --> 06:32.880
Thanks, Mom.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.960
You're never going to win
that argument with him, you know?

06:39.920 --> 06:42.640
There's got to be something
that can counteract

06:42.720 --> 06:44.800
the influence
my lunatic father has on him.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.600
Hey, I love that lunatic
and so does Johnny,

06:47.680 --> 06:49.520
so watch it.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.200
Johnny spends too much time with him, Mel.

06:56.200 --> 07:00.880
Pete, your dad is a good man.
He would never do anything to hurt Johnny.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.200
He would never mean to.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.440
(INHALES)

07:04.520 --> 07:06.240
I take it you haven't told him yet.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.160
No.

07:08.240 --> 07:11.320
It's never easy to deliver news
you know is gonna break someone's heart

07:11.400 --> 07:13.320
but we have to tell him.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.400
Soon.

07:18.680 --> 07:23.080
(<i>FIRE ESCAPE</i>  PLAYING)

07:53.880 --> 07:57.320
Morning, Pop. I'm going down to Grandpa's.
There's a killer swell.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.800
We need to talk to you first.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.960
Can't we do it later?
Jake and Eddie are already out there.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.600
Johnny. This can't wait.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.720
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah, we just, um...

08:09.680 --> 08:11.760
Well, we have some news.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.920
We just got our first really major
Net Study contract.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.520
That's rad, Pop.

08:16.640 --> 08:20.280
Yeah. It'll be the pilot programme
in a series of prep schools.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.800
Starting with one called Skyline Academy.

08:23.840 --> 08:27.840
It's private. Great teachers.
And very exclusive.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.880
-Oh. So you have to go and set it up?
-Exactly.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.320
So how long will you be gone?

08:35.600 --> 08:37.840
It's not just a matter of a quick trip.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.560
It's more like a move.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.800
-A move back east.
-Moving back east?

08:44.200 --> 08:45.560
Like where? Kauai?

08:46.720 --> 08:50.200
Back east like the east coast
of the United States.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.640

08:53.560 --> 08:56.280
And not just me. All of us.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.320
When are we leaving?

09:01.440 --> 09:04.720
In a week.
Everything's been arranged for us already.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.400
The house. The car.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.320
I know how you must be feeling right now

09:08.400 --> 09:10.640
but I really think
you're gonna love it there.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.200
You'll get a great education,
you'll make--

09:12.320 --> 09:14.760
Can I just... Can I just go surfing now?

09:15.880 --> 09:17.600
You're sure you're okay about this?

09:18.800 --> 09:21.280
Yeah. Yeah.

-JAKE: What a rip-off! I can't believe it.
-Yeah, man.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.920
Like, why didn't you say something?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.360
Wwll what was I gonna say?

09:31.480 --> 09:33.560
"Have a nice trip?
Write me when you get there?"

09:33.640 --> 09:35.400
Hey, you never know. That could work.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.920
-Maybe it won't be that bad.
-Dude!

09:39.000 --> 09:43.080
There's no waves there. No surfing.
It's freezing.

Hello? I think he knows that, Jake.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.440
Let's just go surfing.
I want to forget about this.

I really don't want to go, Grandpa.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.960
You know, when you were born,

10:25.840 --> 10:27.760
your mom and pop named you Johnny.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.680
But I named you Pono, you know why?

10:30.520 --> 10:33.040
-'Cause it means goodness?
-Exactly.

10:34.240 --> 10:37.880
And no matter what, you always seem
to find the good in everything.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.640
Well, I'm looking, Grandpa.
I just don't see it.

10:43.280 --> 10:48.600
Remember a couple of days ago?
The TV said a storm was gonna come ashore.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.800
Yeah, I thought it was going
to blow out the championships.

10:52.760 --> 10:53.760
Look what happened.

10:54.360 --> 10:57.840

the killer wave you rode for the win.

it stays in the family, eh?

Come on. We're going to miss the plane.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.280

for surfing the Internet.

I'm gonna miss you too, Grandpa.

Remember, you always got a home here.
Always.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.680
Hey, Johnny.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.000
Did you remember
to leave something warm unpacked?

11:49.080 --> 11:51.200
It might be pretty cold
when we get to Vermont.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.240
I'll be okay. How bad can it be?

-Tell you what.

Why don't we try looking forward
to what's in front of us

instead of what's back in Hawaii?

is not going anywhere.

for a couple of hours. (CHUCKLES)

about the Academy in here.

to a place like this when I was your age.

with his name on it and everything.

-You've got your class schedule?
-Yeah.

14:31.720 --> 14:34.240

before I hit the computer room?

No, I can do it.

-You're sure?
-Pop, I'll be fine.

I'm not gonna make a break for it
or anything.

All right. Remember, I'm staying late
so you have to catch the bus.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.640
No problem, Pop.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.320
-Miss Arthur?
-You must be Johnny.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.760
-Yes, ma'am.
-Welcome to American History.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.400
Why don't you have a seat over by Brett.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.600
What planet did he beam down from?

15:19.440 --> 15:22.680
Hawaii, brah.
It's actually a state, not a planet.

15:23.760 --> 15:26.080
As long as we're on the subject, Brett,

15:26.920 --> 15:29.800
could you give us some information
about the Hawaiian islands?

15:29.880 --> 15:33.120
Cultural, historical,
anything you can muster.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.200
-They all wear lame clothes.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

15:37.360 --> 15:40.000
I'm sorry, Miss Arthur.
It won't happen again.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.200
Why don't we just start with the basics?

15:43.280 --> 15:46.880
Could you please name the
principal islands of the Hawaiian chain?

15:51.680 --> 15:52.960
Emily, how about you?

15:53.040 --> 15:58.400
Hawaii, Kauai, Niihau,
Maui, Molokai, Oahu,

15:58.480 --> 16:00.320
and I think it's Kahoolawe.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.240
Very good, Emily. Very good.

16:03.120 --> 16:06.480
Johnny, why don't you tell me
something about Hawaii?

16:06.560 --> 16:09.520
Hey, have you ever seen a volcano blow up?

16:09.600 --> 16:10.840
(SNICKERING)

16:10.920 --> 16:12.720
What? I was just asking.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.760
Well, there are two volcanoes
on the Big Island that are still active.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.480
But I've never seen one actually erupt.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.960
Well why don't you tell us what
you like to do for fun back in Hawaii?

16:23.320 --> 16:25.960
Uh, well, there's lots
of stuff. Um...

16:26.320 --> 16:28.600
Surfing, I do that every day.

16:28.680 --> 16:32.240
I mean, unless it's blown out or flat.
Or if I'm sick.

16:32.320 --> 16:35.840
But I mean, I have to be really,
really sick. Like I'm dying!

16:36.520 --> 16:41.280
Or there's also windsurfing, fishing.
There's great hiking on the North Shore.

16:41.360 --> 16:45.080
Kayaking, waterfalls.
I go to the beach a lot.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.880
Uh... Girls in bikinis.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.480
-Pineapple or peaches?
-Pineapple, please.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.760
Oh, I'm sorry. I asked for pineapple.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.160
And that is what you got.

16:59.800 --> 17:03.320
LUNCHLADY:
Who's next? Pineapple or peaches?

17:04.360 --> 17:05.480
(LAUGHING)

17:12.360 --> 17:14.160
Sorry, Hawaii, this is my seat.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.360
No problem.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.960
I'll just find another one.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.120
(LAUGHS) Bye-bye.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.600
No way this is pineapple.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.280
-BRETT: That guy's a loser, huh?
-Yeah, what a loser.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.920
Uh, you can take a look at it if you want.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.120
-That zine rips, brah.
-Rips? Brah?

18:05.200 --> 18:07.240
You're in America now, boy.
Try speaking English.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.760
Oh, sorry, dude.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.840
I just meant that it was slamming.
You know, totally nectar.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.360
Do the girls look like this in Hawaii?

18:14.440 --> 18:17.480
-I mean, like every one?
-Pretty much.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.880
You can give it back to me
when you're done. Okay?

18:22.520 --> 18:25.200
-Hey, Brett, look.
-And?

18:25.280 --> 18:28.280
It says here that "Johnny Kapa-whatever,

18:28.360 --> 18:30.880
"the most promising young rider
on the North Shore,

18:31.000 --> 18:32.760
"goes Richter at Backdoor."

18:34.520 --> 18:37.960
-Hey, Brett, how do you go Richter?
-Does it look like I care?

18:40.760 --> 18:41.760
What's going on?

18:41.840 --> 18:44.440
Oh. Not much.
We were just welcoming the new kid.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.200
-So, are we skiing?
-Yeah, let's go.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.640
Hey, Hawaii! Wait up a sec.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.960
You ever skied before?

19:02.720 --> 19:04.520
Uh, well, um...

19:05.200 --> 19:06.640
Yeah, a couple of times.

19:07.560 --> 19:10.360
Well, uh, we're doing the summit
this afternoon if you want to join us.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.480
-Sure.
-All right.

19:14.640 --> 19:15.840
(SIGHS)

19:15.920 --> 19:17.240
How hard can it be?

19:17.640 --> 19:19.800
-EMILY: Okay.
-JOHNNY: Whoa, what's with these boots?

19:23.400 --> 19:25.840
You're sure you've done this before?

19:25.920 --> 19:28.880
Oh, yeah, I'll be fine
once I get the skis on my feet.

19:29.520 --> 19:33.520
-Well, here you go, then.
-Thanks, Mr. Edison.

19:34.600 --> 19:35.920
Yeah, thanks.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.880
-Whoa, whoa!
-Oh no, Johnny!

19:39.040 --> 19:40.720
(CRASHING)

19:43.240 --> 19:45.840
I'm sorry, I really am. I'm sorry.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.000
Forget it. Just go.

19:48.240 --> 19:51.320
This guy's never been near a mountain
that doesn't have lava coming out of it.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.520

-Come on.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.880
(WHOOPING)

20:00.960 --> 20:02.960
So where did you say you'd skied before?

20:04.080 --> 20:06.560
Um, well...

20:06.640 --> 20:07.640
Snowmass.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.160
Yeah. That's a great place.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.160
Oh, man. I hope you don't get bored.
I mean...

20:12.240 --> 20:14.960
The runs can be pretty tame
for somebody who's skied out west.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.600
(LAUGHS)

20:17.120 --> 20:18.960
I don't think I'll get bored.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.200
-What's wrong?
-My binding's loose.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.920
I'm gonna see
if the lift guy has a screwdriver.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.200
All right. We'll wait here for you.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.960
Hey Brett, do you think
you could give me a hand?

20:47.040 --> 20:48.040
Sure.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.040
-Sorry about that.
-Bye-bye.

20:51.240 --> 20:52.720

20:54.080 --> 20:56.680
Whoa. Whoa.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.080

21:02.000 --> 21:03.200
Woah.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.240
Legs, don't fail me now--
Woah!

21:05.320 --> 21:06.800
Watch out!

21:08.240 --> 21:10.000

21:11.200 --> 21:13.400
-(ALL EXCLAIMING)
-Sorry. Sorry.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.120
Woah...

21:17.480 --> 21:20.080
-Hey Brett, maybe we should stop him.
-No way.

21:21.960 --> 21:23.480
What's the matter, Hawaii?

21:23.560 --> 21:26.280
Don't they teach you how to stop
in those Hawaiian ski schools?

21:26.360 --> 21:27.720
Mind telling me how?

21:27.800 --> 21:29.800
I'm sure you'll stop before
you hit the highway.

21:29.880 --> 21:30.880
Or maybe not!

21:30.960 --> 21:31.960
That's funny.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.560
I'd be laughing too
if I wasn't about to lose my life.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.240
(SCREAMS)

21:38.960 --> 21:41.120
-He's totally out of control.
-Tell me about it.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.720
We tried to stop him.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.200
If he doesn't watch out,
he's gonna get somebody hurt.

-I didn't hit anybody, did I?
-No,

22:27.000 --> 22:28.880

being more careful next time.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.000
I don't think there's gonna be
a next time.

and you've already gotten your first clue.

without you, Brett.

-What?

22:48.960 --> 22:50.840
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.920
So, how was school?
Did you make any new friends?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.440
Yeah, they took me skiing.

22:55.520 --> 22:57.240
Really? How was it?

22:57.320 --> 22:59.040
A lot harder than it looks.

22:59.120 --> 23:02.800
-Did you fall?
-Only once, but... I made it count.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.480
-Are you all right?
-Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

Nah.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.360
You know him.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.720
He's probably camping out
on the other side of the island,

23:48.800 --> 23:50.000
chasing some huge swell.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.520
I think I'd better do my homework.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.680
Mom told me
you had a rough day on the slopes.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.840
Yeah, so did everyone else
who got in front of me.

on what's important.

be back in Hawaii surfing.

Honey, that's great.

It's just that
maybe you should start small

24:31.720 --> 24:34.360
and build to king of the mountain.

Hey, look what finally came.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.560
You look like you grew up here, son.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.120
Well...

blend in a little better.

What did you do?

25:51.440 --> 25:52.440
Do?

25:53.400 --> 25:55.560
Oh. Nothing, he's my father.

-We like to call him headmaster.
-Wow!

I thought it was intense
my dad working on the computers.

26:03.240 --> 26:04.800
Must be brutal for you.

Let's just say I have to study
twice as hard and never be late for class.

It's weird, though.

you know what's the one thing
that sends my dad over the edge?

-Dress code violation.

mind you.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.360

why we have a dress code here?

No, not really.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.760
that if students don't have to think
about who's wearing

the latest or the most expensive fashions,

27:04.240 --> 27:07.400
it sets everyone on an equal footing
right from the start.

is the person inside the uniform

27:12.880 --> 27:14.160

29:52.280 --> 29:54.720
Not bad. You're actually
starting to look like a Sky.

29:57.960 --> 30:01.720
Hey, uh, some kid called me that
yesterday. What's it mean?

30:01.800 --> 30:02.800
Shh.

30:03.280 --> 30:05.440
That's what they call anyone
from the Academy.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.560
Kids who go to Maple Valley
are the Urchins.

30:07.640 --> 30:10.360
They definitely got ripped
when they came to picking names.

30:10.440 --> 30:11.800
I never thought about it.

30:13.280 --> 30:16.000
Hey, Emily, you ever go snowboarding?

30:17.440 --> 30:20.680
-Of course not.
-Haven't you ever wanted to try?

30:20.760 --> 30:22.120
We don't snowboard, Johnny.

30:23.120 --> 30:25.280
-Why not?
-Because we ski.

30:25.360 --> 30:28.960
Urchins board and stay at Air Summit,
we ski and stay at the resort.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.280
That's the way it is.

30:34.560 --> 30:37.240
Oh yeah, that reminds me.
I got to pull that 360 today.

30:37.320 --> 30:38.760
You know, just to show you
who's the champ.

30:38.840 --> 30:39.840
Sam...

30:40.560 --> 30:43.120
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Oh. Yeah, no problem.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.160
Dude, did you miss your stop or something?

30:45.280 --> 30:47.440
No, it's cool, brah, I just need a minute.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.440
Yeah, go ahead. I'll catch up.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.400
Sam, he's a Sky.

30:51.560 --> 30:54.080
(SNICKERS) Chill, Aaron.
It's not contagious.

30:58.720 --> 31:00.880
-So what's up?
-Well, here's the thing.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.200
I've been on a board my whole life.

31:03.280 --> 31:06.160
And if I don't get on one soon,
I'm gonna lose it big time.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.400
Since there's no big wave beach
in Vermont,

31:08.480 --> 31:10.000
figure I gotta do the next best thing.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.040
-That's where you come in.
-Wait a minute...

31:12.120 --> 31:14.960
Look, I don't care about the Skies
or the Urchins or whatever.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.800
I just wanna learn how to ride.

31:19.760 --> 31:20.880
What's up with that?

31:21.760 --> 31:23.800
-I'm just checking your balance.
-Oh.

31:24.640 --> 31:27.680
Yeah. Follow me. There's someone you
gotta meet before we head up the hill.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.760
All right.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.000
(CHUCKLES) You thought I was going to
kick your butt, didn't you?

31:32.080 --> 31:34.080
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, right. You could try.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.720
(BOTH LAUGHING)

31:43.480 --> 31:45.520
Hey. You better button that coat up.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.600
We're on the other side
of the mountain now.

31:51.240 --> 31:54.560
-(IMITATES BIRDSONG)
-(RESPONDS IN BIRDSONG)

31:55.280 --> 31:58.080
-Randy!
-Free Sammy! What's the haps?

31:59.000 --> 32:02.600
I've found you a new customer.
Randy, this is Johnny Ka...

32:02.680 --> 32:04.560
-Kapahaala.
-Yeah. What he say.

32:04.640 --> 32:07.840
-He just came in from Hawaii.
-Oh, <i>aloha,</i>  brah.

32:07.920 --> 32:09.360
<i>Aloha.</i>

32:09.440 --> 32:11.520
Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?

32:12.440 --> 32:14.800
-Have you ever been to the islands?
-Oh, I wish!

32:14.880 --> 32:17.680
Wasn't there an outrageous surfer
over there named Johnny Kapahaala?

32:17.760 --> 32:18.840
Dude was an animal, man.

32:18.920 --> 32:22.000
They used to call him Johnny Tsunami.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.480
They still do. He's my grandfather.

32:24.560 --> 32:27.560
No way. No possible way!

32:27.640 --> 32:30.120
-Yes way.
-Oh, man, this is truly phenomenal, dude.

32:30.200 --> 32:33.560
I'm gonna fully hook you up.
Whatever you need, no charge.

32:33.680 --> 32:36.880
You know, take a look around.
Pick it out. I'll be back.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.440
Thanks, Randy.

32:42.960 --> 32:46.240
-I don't have to wear one of these, do I?
-Don't touch!

32:46.600 --> 32:48.240
No, you're not cool enough yet.

32:48.320 --> 32:51.840
Maybe when you get your first big air.
Maybe.

33:01.440 --> 33:04.320
So this is just like surfing.
But with snow, right?

33:05.240 --> 33:07.840
(CHUCKLES) If you say so. Go for it.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.560
Whoa!

33:15.320 --> 33:17.160
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

33:24.680 --> 33:25.720
(CHUCKLES)

33:25.800 --> 33:29.120
I've never surfed, but all the magazines
say there are two big differences.

33:29.600 --> 33:32.320
You know, you could have told me that
before I ate all that snow.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.520
Yeah, but it's better
to learn first-hand, dude.

33:35.760 --> 33:37.560
-So you gonna tell me?
-Yeah.

33:37.640 --> 33:38.880
First, steering.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.920
In the water, you steer
with the front of your board, right?

33:41.600 --> 33:44.760
-Basically.
-On the snow, it's a 180 the other way.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.400
You steer with the back of your board.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.360
You try to do it with the front,
you'll munch.

33:48.880 --> 33:51.120
So I guess walking the board's
out of the question?

33:51.200 --> 33:53.200
Yeah. That's the other big difference.

33:53.920 --> 33:56.080
Now try again. But go slow.

33:56.560 --> 33:57.560
All right.

34:01.880 --> 34:02.920
-(CRASHES)
-Oh!

34:10.200 --> 34:11.760
No. No, no.

34:11.840 --> 34:12.840
Whoa!

34:13.680 --> 34:14.840
(CHUCKLES)

34:19.240 --> 34:22.120
Well, at least this wave
doesn't thrash you after you fall.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.520
All right, try again.

34:24.600 --> 34:27.920
(YELLING AND WHOOPING)

34:28.120 --> 34:29.680
When do we get to do that?

34:30.480 --> 34:32.520
You gotta learn to stand up first.

34:33.120 --> 34:35.200
Yeah. That'd probably help.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.760
Put your hand up. Here.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.880
-Come across.
-Okay. With this hand.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.520
Yeah. Come across. Then...

34:52.480 --> 34:54.680
-You got it.
-(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

34:55.960 --> 34:56.960
Yeah, there you go.

35:04.840 --> 35:07.560
You gotta be kidding me.
Hey, Brett, look at this.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.240
Oh, you've never seen one before?

35:09.320 --> 35:12.160
Oh, that's right.
They don't have snowboards at Skyline.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.560
Wow, I guess
no matter how much you dress up an Urchin,

35:14.640 --> 35:16.320
the true loser always comes out.

35:16.400 --> 35:19.560
You know, it's like dressing up
a bunch of snobs in real clothes.

35:19.680 --> 35:22.400
Man, I don't see what the big deal
with these things is anyway.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.440
I mean, where's the challenge?

35:24.560 --> 35:25.840
(SCREAMING)

35:26.000 --> 35:27.160
(GROANING)

35:27.240 --> 35:29.880
Yeah, man. Nothing to it.

35:29.960 --> 35:30.960
(CAR HORN)

35:31.040 --> 35:32.920
Hey, Johnny, you want a ride?

35:34.040 --> 35:35.880
Gotta go. Keep your tips up.

35:44.640 --> 35:45.880
Those guys from school?

35:46.680 --> 35:47.680
Yeah.

35:48.200 --> 35:50.560
See? I told you you'd make new friends.

35:57.600 --> 36:01.480
Hey, it'll happen. You're the first one
from the Academy who's crossed the mine.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.960
You're sort of in no-man's-land.

36:04.040 --> 36:07.400
Maybe if we got more Skies to go boarding,
things would change.

36:08.200 --> 36:11.240
It's not about boarding, dude.
Dad says it's like any other war.

36:11.320 --> 36:14.280
-It's about land.
-What do you mean?

36:14.400 --> 36:16.600
Well see, the whole mountain
used to belong to this one dude.

36:16.680 --> 36:19.640
When he died ten years ago,
his family divided it down the middle.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.160
Boarders on this side,
skiers on the other.

36:22.520 --> 36:25.440
Only problem is
the best runs are on Skyline.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.720
And we're not allowed to go over there.

36:27.800 --> 36:30.560
-That's completely bogus.
-Fully.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.520
But what are we supposed to do?

36:34.520 --> 36:35.520
Whoa!

36:36.920 --> 36:40.920
You're still letting the hill work you.
You gotta work the hill, baby.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.560
I can't wait to get you out in the ocean.
We're talking some serious payback.

36:44.640 --> 36:47.880
I hope you do. The only large bodies of
water I've ever seen were frozen.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.200
-No way!
-I'm serious.

36:50.280 --> 36:51.760
This is the first place I've lived

36:51.840 --> 36:54.720
that hasn't had the words
"glacier" or "ice" in its name.

36:54.800 --> 36:57.640
I think my core temperature is like
five degrees lower than most humans'.

36:58.680 --> 36:59.680
So, just remember, you know,

36:59.760 --> 37:02.120
put your weight on your front leg
and whip it around with the back.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.240
-You know, just be aggressive.
-All right.

37:05.040 --> 37:07.000
There you go. That's it.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.640
When you gonna bail on this dude?

37:11.720 --> 37:14.880
Hey, come on, man.
At least he didn't face-plant this time.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.480
-Whoa!
-Ooh!

37:22.920 --> 37:25.040
Sure it's cool with your dad
that I came over?

37:25.120 --> 37:26.160
Oh, absolutely.

37:26.240 --> 37:29.520
(AIRPLANE FLIES OVERHEAD)

37:29.640 --> 37:30.640
Whoa.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.800
Do those planes fly over
all the time like that?

37:32.880 --> 37:35.920
I guess so.
I've been living on bases my whole life.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.720
I don't even notice any more.

37:37.800 --> 37:40.320
-Where they all going?
-Oh, everywhere.

37:40.400 --> 37:43.600
South Carolina, Texas, Montana.

37:43.680 --> 37:46.760
-Hawaii?
-I don't know. Probably.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.400
Oh. Is this your mom?

37:52.440 --> 37:53.440
Yeah.

37:53.880 --> 37:56.360
She passed away a couple of years ago.

37:57.480 --> 38:00.680
-Oh. Sorry, man.
-Me too.

38:01.120 --> 38:03.560
Don't you ever get tired
of moving around so much?

38:03.640 --> 38:06.440
Yeah. My dad promised me
we'd be staying here for a while, though.

38:09.160 --> 38:11.120
Oh hey, Sarge, what are you doing home?

38:11.200 --> 38:13.960
I finished up early today, Sammy.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.560
Figured we'd head into town,
catch a movie.

38:16.640 --> 38:17.640
Awesome!

38:17.960 --> 38:19.040
(SIGHS)

38:19.600 --> 38:23.200
This must be the famous Hawaiian surfer
I've been hearing so much about.

38:23.280 --> 38:25.080
Yes, sir. I'm Johnny.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.920
<i>Aloha,</i>  Johnny. Pleasure to meet you.
You kow, you're welcome to join us.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.400
Uh, I wish I could, but I gotta
get back home.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.960
Hmm. Well, maybe another time then.

38:33.720 --> 38:36.320
Tell you what. You give me a minute
to change into my civvies,

38:36.400 --> 38:38.480
-I'll give you a ride.
-That'd be great.

38:39.840 --> 38:42.040
Dude! Your dad's so cool.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.120
Totally.

38:43.520 --> 38:47.360
Um... So, tell me. What's it like?

38:48.360 --> 38:49.360
What's what like?

38:49.960 --> 38:52.240
-Hawaii.
-Oh!

38:52.320 --> 38:56.960
It's so cool. Just think the exact
opposite of this town and you got it.

38:57.040 --> 39:00.040
-If you come over tomorrow, I'll show you.
-Cool.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.760
That is a wicked big wave!

39:06.840 --> 39:11.320
That's nothing.
Winter of '94, Waimea had 40-foot swells.

39:11.560 --> 39:12.840
It was insane.

39:12.920 --> 39:17.040
-You surfed 40-foot waves?
-I was too little. My grandpa did, though.

39:17.680 --> 39:20.520
-How about your dad?
-He doesn't surf.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.560
How come?

39:23.600 --> 39:28.640
Well, he's about as much like me
as this place is like Oahu.

39:29.080 --> 39:30.080
Hm.

39:32.680 --> 39:37.600
Next time it's raging like that,
I'm gonna be there. No matter what.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.840
Well if you end up snowboarding like that,

39:39.920 --> 39:42.600
you'll be getting bigger air
than anyone around here.

39:43.360 --> 39:44.960
Except me, of course.

39:45.080 --> 39:46.360
(LAUGHS)

39:48.640 --> 39:51.000
Hey Sam, thanks for doing all this.

39:51.080 --> 39:54.160
-What?
-You know. Teaching me and hanging out.

39:56.240 --> 39:59.400
I know what it's like to be the new kid.
But it gets better.

40:00.040 --> 40:02.000
Hey. It's all good, brah.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.760
-Something wrong?
-I don't get you.

40:16.160 --> 40:19.240
-What's to get?
-Why are you snowboarding?

40:19.320 --> 40:21.880
Well, I guess because it's fun.

40:21.960 --> 40:25.680
You're not gonna try to convince me
your father has a problem with that too?

40:25.760 --> 40:26.920
Very funny.

40:27.920 --> 40:30.080
-Is it hard to learn?
-Yeah.

40:30.440 --> 40:32.920
-You probably wouldn't be able to do it.
-What do you mean?

40:33.000 --> 40:35.480
Well, it's just... Just trust me.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.800
You would never be able to get up
on one of these things.

40:37.880 --> 40:39.040
Why not?

40:39.120 --> 40:43.920
No offence, but I heard the longer you've
been a Sky, the harder it is to board.

40:44.280 --> 40:48.960
From what I can tell, you were born a Sky,
so you might as well stick to skiing.

40:49.960 --> 40:53.680
And besides, you wouldn't want Brett
to get mad, would you?

40:55.440 --> 40:56.880
Surf's up, brah.

40:58.720 --> 41:02.360
Can you believe he went Urchin?
How pathetic is that?

41:07.080 --> 41:11.520
You're getting better, except for that
Superman dive you pulled on the hill.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.640
-Yeah, right.
-But you caught your toe on that one.

41:13.880 --> 41:16.720
-(CLEARS THROAT)
-(LAUGHS)

41:16.800 --> 41:20.520
-Sure no one followed you?
-Very funny. Now what do I do?

41:20.600 --> 41:24.440
Sam, this is Emily.
Sky number two to bail on skiing.

41:24.560 --> 41:27.440
-I'm not bailing on anything.
-Then why are you here?

41:27.520 --> 41:29.840
-I have to have a reason?
-No, I just thought that...

41:29.920 --> 41:31.040
Are we going or not?

42:00.080 --> 42:02.400
Okay, I'm ready for a real run now.

42:03.040 --> 42:06.240
No, Emily. You're doing pretty good
for your first time, but I don't think...

42:06.320 --> 42:08.200
EMILY: Can't keep up,
I'll wait for you at the bottom.

42:08.280 --> 42:09.760
Wait, Emily. Don't!

42:09.840 --> 42:12.520
(EMILY GASPS AND SCREAMS)

42:14.360 --> 42:17.880
No, no, no, no, no!

Oh, no.

Wait here.

42:47.720 --> 42:49.280
Where is she? Can you see her?

42:50.120 --> 42:52.120
Yeah. Yeah, I see her.

42:52.960 --> 42:56.640
-Emily! Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine, but I'm stuck!

42:57.160 --> 43:00.080
Okay, just hang on. Just hang on.

43:00.440 --> 43:01.760
We gotta get her some help.

-Sam! You all right?
-Johnny!

43:17.800 --> 43:20.680
You're gonna have to ski down
and find the ski patrol.

43:20.760 --> 43:22.600
All right. Okay. All right.

43:25.120 --> 43:27.360
Okay. All right. I'll be right back.

Are you all right?

43:29.320 --> 43:32.280
I guess it depends
on your definition of all right.

-Yeah, yeah he's good enough.

Whoa!

43:54.840 --> 43:56.240
How you doing, Emily?

43:56.320 --> 43:58.360
I can't get my footing with the snowboard.

43:59.480 --> 44:04.400
Okay. Just hold on. I'm gonna try
to reach down and get you out, okay?

44:04.480 --> 44:07.480
Just hold on. It's gonna be all right.

44:09.200 --> 44:11.600
Hurry up, Sam.
I can't hold on much longer.

-Where are they?

Right here. Just hang on, guys.
I'm gonna grab a rope. I'll be right back.

-Yeah, Johnny! We're gonna be all right!
-Way to go, Johnny.

45:08.200 --> 45:09.760
Let's just hope this reaches.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.440
All right, here it comes, guys.
Watch your heads.

45:16.720 --> 45:17.720
Grab an end.

45:17.800 --> 45:20.600
Wrap the loop around her wrist.
We're gonna pull her up first.

Here we go. Ready?

One, two, pull!

-Yeah.

45:54.920 --> 45:56.200
I think so.

45:56.720 --> 46:00.160
Oh, okay. That's real touching,
but I'm still down here, guys.

46:00.240 --> 46:02.560
Sam, just hang on. We'll be right there.

46:04.320 --> 46:07.120
Daddy, I'm fine. Yes.

46:07.240 --> 46:09.320
No, I promise I'm not hurt.

46:09.400 --> 46:10.680
You all right?

46:13.600 --> 46:15.640
No, I don't need to see a doctor.

46:15.720 --> 46:17.360
-Thank you, you know. For everything.
-No problem.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.840
Make sure you tell your friend
to watch the signs next time.

46:19.920 --> 46:21.640
Daddy, that's not fair.

46:21.760 --> 46:22.720
Let's go.

46:23.840 --> 46:24.840
Yes.

46:26.080 --> 46:27.080
Look, Hawaii,

46:27.160 --> 46:28.800
if you want to hang with these losers,
that's up to you.

46:28.880 --> 46:31.440
But you don't need
to drag Emily down with you.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.280
Why don't you chill, Brett?
It was an accident.

46:33.360 --> 46:35.320
-Stay out of it, Urchin.
-Hey.

46:35.920 --> 46:37.600
Look. Stay away from Emily.

46:37.680 --> 46:39.200
You know the only reason
she's been nice to you

46:39.280 --> 46:40.320
is because her father made her.

46:40.400 --> 46:41.760
-That's imposs--
-It's true.

46:41.840 --> 46:44.560
But now you got her grounded,
it's not gonna be a problem.

46:44.640 --> 46:47.240
You're an Urchin now, Hawaii.
You made your choice.

46:47.320 --> 46:50.160
Why don't you just
stick with your little maggot pals

46:50.240 --> 46:51.520
and leave Emily alone?

46:54.440 --> 46:57.720
-Just forget about it.
-Sammy! Down here.

47:01.960 --> 47:05.120
You know, you two were lucky there was
a patroller with the snowmobile.

47:05.200 --> 47:07.520
I'm sorry, Dad.
I was just trying to help Emily.

47:07.600 --> 47:08.640
I thought I could get to her.

47:09.280 --> 47:12.320
Well, I guess in a way I should be proud.

47:13.120 --> 47:14.680
But just be careful from now on.

47:15.520 --> 47:17.760
I'd really hate it
if anything bad ever happened.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.200
(EXHALES)

47:22.320 --> 47:24.000
You know why I'm upset, don't you?

47:26.160 --> 47:30.840
'Cause of Emily
and Headmaster Pritchard and your job.

47:31.360 --> 47:33.480
That actually hadn't crossed my mind.

47:33.560 --> 47:35.640
-Until just now.
-Johnny...

47:36.360 --> 47:38.840
We were worried
that something had happened to you.

47:39.600 --> 47:41.080
This isn't Hawaii.

47:41.760 --> 47:45.560
You know your limitations there
and you know how far you can push it.

47:48.880 --> 47:52.440
It's amazing.
You just can't help acting like my father.

47:53.320 --> 47:56.960
-Cool.
-I didn't mean it as a compliment.

48:00.120 --> 48:04.760
Now, why don't you...
Go upstairs and do your homework?

48:09.080 --> 48:10.920
Why did you drag your father into this?

48:11.720 --> 48:13.600
Because he's a part of the problem.

48:14.360 --> 48:17.160
No matter how many miles
I put between the two of them.

48:18.440 --> 48:20.400
Please don't tell me
that's what this move was about.

48:20.480 --> 48:22.520
Getting Johnny away from his grandfather.

48:22.600 --> 48:23.760
Of course not.

48:25.280 --> 48:26.560
But it was a plus.

48:30.320 --> 48:33.120
Look, the kid needs to understand

48:33.200 --> 48:36.840
that my father is not a role model,
he's not a hero.

48:36.920 --> 48:38.680
He's a surf bum.

48:38.760 --> 48:41.440
And I don't want Johnny
ending up like him.

48:41.800 --> 48:43.560
I refuse to allow that to happen.

48:43.640 --> 48:45.560
He's a kid, Peter.

48:46.440 --> 48:48.800
How can we predict
what he's gonna end up like?

48:48.880 --> 48:50.840
Today he wants to be a pro surfer.

48:50.920 --> 48:54.840
Tomorrow he could ask us for a drum set
so he can be a rock star.

48:54.920 --> 48:57.720
Oh, please! Don't even joke about that!

49:03.600 --> 49:08.080
I really hoped that coming here,
taking away some of the distractions,

49:08.160 --> 49:10.000
would bring us together.

49:10.200 --> 49:11.400
As a family.

49:13.880 --> 49:14.920
(SIGHS)

49:15.000 --> 49:18.720
Whatever closeness we're missing
has nothing to do with surfing.

49:19.520 --> 49:21.000
Or your father.

49:21.520 --> 49:24.200
Why do you think
Johnny loves his grandpa so much?

49:24.280 --> 49:25.720
I couldn't begin to tell you.

49:25.800 --> 49:29.080
It's because he doesn't try
to turn him into something he's not.

49:29.160 --> 49:32.880
He encourages him
to be the best person he can.

49:32.960 --> 49:35.720
He celebrates who he is right now.

49:39.040 --> 49:43.840
I know I'm supposed to find the good
in things, but I miss home, Grandpa.

49:43.920 --> 49:46.480
-I miss you.
-I miss you too, Pono.

49:47.560 --> 49:51.240
Look, one thing you can count on.
You always know where to find me.

50:22.480 --> 50:24.680
So, am I grounded?

50:27.360 --> 50:29.000
Why would you think that?

50:30.600 --> 50:32.280
-I just thought...
-Honey...

50:33.160 --> 50:35.160
I think you pretty much
learned your lesson, huh?

50:35.240 --> 50:36.200
I did.

50:42.440 --> 50:45.840
Mom, why does Dad hate Grandpa so much?

50:45.920 --> 50:47.720
He doesn't hate him at all.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.000
They just...

50:52.480 --> 50:53.760
See things differently.

50:54.760 --> 50:55.760
Like what things?

50:57.800 --> 50:59.600
Life, for one.

50:59.680 --> 51:01.560
-That's a pretty big thing.
-Yeah, it is.

51:02.920 --> 51:06.160
You know, your dad and your grandfather
used to have a lot more in common.

51:08.400 --> 51:11.280
It's weird thinking of Dad
any different than he already is.

51:12.200 --> 51:16.480
I mean, caring about stuff besides work.

51:17.120 --> 51:18.120
Johnny...

51:19.360 --> 51:22.880
There are a lot of things that your dad
cares about more than just his job.

51:22.960 --> 51:26.720
-Like what?
-Like being a good father to you.

51:27.800 --> 51:30.320
I think that's the most important thing
in the world to him.

51:32.320 --> 51:33.640
I better start my homework.

-Yeah.

52:12.160 --> 52:16.320
What happened yesterday, we were lucky.
We were really lucky.

Let me guess. No Skies allowed?

No. What you did yesterday.

52:44.800 --> 52:47.680
You got massive air off that jump
to help Sam and that Sky girl.

I didn't even know you saw that.

These are the best runs on the mountain

It must be the altitude.

55:38.160 --> 55:40.000
You might wanna head back to Air Summit.

55:40.080 --> 55:41.520
Yeah, that's where we were going.

55:44.080 --> 55:48.160
Dude, if my dad finds out about this,
I'm gonna be toast.

55:48.280 --> 55:50.200
Maybe he won't find out.

55:51.800 --> 55:53.240
But that's not what happened.

55:53.640 --> 55:56.080
He started it.
I was just defending myself.

55:57.200 --> 55:59.680
I can only go by
what the other kids told me.

56:00.880 --> 56:05.160
There was a fight which you
and the other kids on snowboards started.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.640
That's completely bogus.

56:08.280 --> 56:11.000
Did you talk to Emily? What did she say?

56:11.080 --> 56:13.880
We're getting away from the point.
Which is...

56:13.960 --> 56:17.200
Like our dress code,
which we've been over already,

56:17.600 --> 56:18.920
we have a behavior code that says

56:19.000 --> 56:20.960
you can't start a fight
with another student.

56:21.560 --> 56:23.840
-No matter what the circumstance.
-Yes, sir.

56:23.920 --> 56:26.560
According to the Skyline bylaws,
I could expel you.

56:27.040 --> 56:28.080
After talking with your parents,

56:28.160 --> 56:30.240
I've decided
I'm only going to give you a warning.

56:30.320 --> 56:33.880
But from here on out, you're on probation.

56:33.960 --> 56:35.200
Thank you, sir.

56:42.520 --> 56:44.640
You have to make a pivotal decision,
Johnny.

56:44.720 --> 56:47.040
-About what?
-Where do you want to fit in around here?

56:48.120 --> 56:50.840
I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.

56:51.280 --> 56:53.520
Your friends, Johnny.
I'm talking about your friends.

56:54.640 --> 56:58.760
Are you saying you want me to choose
between the Skies and the Urchins?

57:01.440 --> 57:04.080
Skyline has the reputation it does
for a reason.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.760
The children that go to school across town

57:06.840 --> 57:11.000
will never have the same opportunities
that you will have if you stay here.

57:11.720 --> 57:12.760
But that's not fair.

57:12.840 --> 57:14.880
I mean, it shouldn't be that way,

57:14.960 --> 57:17.360
just like the mountain
shouldn't be divided in two.

57:17.520 --> 57:20.080
It may not be fair, but it's reality.

57:21.640 --> 57:24.480
In the real world, it's exactly the same.

57:24.720 --> 57:27.920
Good or bad, right or wrong, it's fact.

57:29.760 --> 57:31.960
You have the chance to be a winner,
Johnny.

57:32.400 --> 57:34.320
I would hate to see you
give up that chance

57:34.400 --> 57:37.920
just for a few rides down the mountain
strapped to a piece of wood.

57:41.080 --> 57:43.000
At least I didn't get kicked out.

57:43.080 --> 57:44.760
You see that as some sort of victory?

57:44.840 --> 57:47.680
Can we please wait till we get home
to talk about this?

57:47.760 --> 57:50.800
I'm telling you the truth.
I didn't start it.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.120
Hey, Sam.

58:01.800 --> 58:04.600
Look, I can't really hang out right now.

58:04.680 --> 58:06.600
Me either, but I gotta talk to you.

58:06.680 --> 58:08.600
Sam, whatever it is,
it's gonna have to wait.

58:08.680 --> 58:10.600
I know, sir, but it's important.
If I could just--

58:10.680 --> 58:13.760
-Sam. I said...
-Peter?

58:13.840 --> 58:17.160
Why don't you and I go inside
and give these guys five minutes?

58:17.240 --> 58:18.680
Yeah, yeah that's all I need.

58:20.440 --> 58:23.960
Fine. But that's it. Then inside.

58:29.960 --> 58:32.800
-You're in it deep, huh?
-Majorly.

58:32.880 --> 58:34.760
I don't even want to think about it.

58:35.960 --> 58:37.680
So what were you gonna tell me?

58:38.680 --> 58:41.760
(SIGHS) You know how my dad said
we'd be staying here for a while?

58:41.840 --> 58:42.840
Yeah.

58:42.960 --> 58:45.800
Well they gave him a new post
and a promotion to sergeant major.

58:45.920 --> 58:48.360
-We leave at the end of the week.
-For?

58:48.440 --> 58:49.760
Iceland.

58:50.960 --> 58:53.280
Man, I am so over being cold!

58:53.360 --> 58:55.840
That is way harsh.
I can't even believe it.

58:55.920 --> 58:58.640
You can't believe it?
How do you think I feel?

58:58.720 --> 59:01.880
My dad promised. I mean he promised me!

59:02.560 --> 59:05.080
-I'm sorry, brah.
-I mean, I like it here.

59:05.160 --> 59:07.280
Hanging with you, boarding.

59:08.040 --> 59:09.160
I don't wanna move again.

59:10.160 --> 59:11.280
We gotta do something.

59:12.320 --> 59:14.680
Too late. It's over.

59:35.080 --> 59:36.720
What was so important?

59:39.080 --> 59:43.640
-Sam's moving to Iceland.
-Oh, Johnny, I'm so sorry.

59:45.920 --> 59:47.320
You may not wanna hear this,

59:48.080 --> 59:50.880
but Sam leaving is probably for the best.

59:51.280 --> 59:53.280
(SCOFFS) How can you even say that?

59:53.960 --> 59:56.640
You have to learn
to get along with your peers.

59:57.520 --> 1:00:02.440
Until you do, I want you
to stay away from those... Urchins.

1:00:03.160 --> 1:00:05.360
-Pete!
-And I don't want you snowboarding.

1:00:05.440 --> 1:00:08.960
-I can't believe my own father's a Sky.
-Johnny!

1:00:09.040 --> 1:00:12.440
I thought moving here
was the worst day of my life.

1:00:12.520 --> 1:00:15.560
I tried to fit in. I tried to get along.

1:00:15.640 --> 1:00:18.880
And finally I start to,
and my best friend moves away.

1:00:18.960 --> 1:00:21.000
And now you're telling me
I can't even hang out

1:00:21.080 --> 1:00:22.680
with the only other ones I have?

1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:25.280
(EXCLAIMS)
This reeks so bad I can't even take it.

1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:28.840
Someday you'll understand
why I'm doing this.

1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:30.760
No, Pop. I never will.

1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:33.640
There's nothing right about this,
and you know it.

1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:36.840
I wish Grandpa was here.
At least he understands me.

1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:15.600
Hey, it's me. Let me ask you a question.

1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:18.400
Exactly how cold are you?

1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:22.440
Look at this.

1:01:25.880 --> 1:01:29.400
"Mom and Pop, I'm sorry for everything,
for letting you down,

1:01:29.800 --> 1:01:31.920
"but Sam and I can't live here any more.

1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:37.240
"Please don't worry about us.
We'll be fine where we're going."

1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:40.440
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:43.120
I don't believe this.

1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:47.520
I do. I have no problem believing this.

1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:50.760
(DOORBELL RINGS)

1:01:54.400 --> 1:01:55.480
Did you get one of these?

1:01:56.400 --> 1:01:58.040
Can you think of anywhere they would go?

1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:02.600
They're two 13-year-olds with no money.
How far can they possibly get?

1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:10.080
I still think my dad
is gonna have me court-martialled

1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:12.280
once he finds out
we snuck onto one of their planes.

1:02:12.360 --> 1:02:15.120
Yeah. But tell me this isn't worth it.

1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:19.760
All right, it was worth it,
it was worth it!

1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:27.600
Hey! Pono!

1:02:28.560 --> 1:02:30.440
-(GRANDPA EXCLAIMING)
-That's my grandpa!

1:02:31.320 --> 1:02:32.960
(EXCLAIMS JOYFULLY)

1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:43.000
You gotta hand it to him, Pete.

1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:47.000
Hopping a military transport
and flying halfway around the world

1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:48.720
shows some serious ingenuity.

1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:52.880
No, Dad.
What it shows is some serious stupidity.

1:02:53.680 --> 1:02:57.080
And I can only imagine
that you welcomed them with open arms.

1:02:57.160 --> 1:02:58.720
Whoa!

1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:01.600
Look, I hate to stop this fight
before we get to the later rounds,

1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:04.000
but, you now what,
it's not about you and me.

1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:07.480
-You better let me talk to him.
-Nah, they're sleeping. Let 'em rest.

1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:11.120
Fine. Then you will get them
on a flight back tomorrow.

1:03:11.280 --> 1:03:14.160
I guess I could, but I'm not going to.

1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:15.240
What do you...

1:03:19.920 --> 1:03:22.800
-What do you mean you're not going to?
-Just what I said.

1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:24.480
I'm not gonna force them to go back.

1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:27.520
This isn't a game.

1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:31.200
You are going to send those two back.
Do you understand me?

1:03:31.800 --> 1:03:34.000
Look, I'll make sure they get back, Pete.

1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:36.560
But only when they're ready.

1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:39.360
<i>Otherwise they'll do it again.</i>
<i>You don't want that.</i>

1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:41.200
-Listen to me.
<i>-Just give it a try.</i>

1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:42.560
It'll be okay.

1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:46.280
It'll work out, son.

1:03:46.360 --> 1:03:48.960
You just worry about what to do
when they get back to Vermont.

1:03:49.920 --> 1:03:50.920

-(PHONE BEEPS)

1:03:57.760 --> 1:03:59.160
SARGE: Are they coming back tomorrow?

1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:05.000
My dad thinks they need
to make that decision on their own.

1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:08.600
He makes me absolutely crazy.

1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:10.880
The boys are in good hands. Really.
Don't worry.

1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:12.160
Are you sure?

1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:16.000
Very.

1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:26.840
You know, when Johnny was born,

1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:30.120
we said that no matter what,
when it came to what was best for him,

1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:33.600
we would stick together,
we'd be a team in raising our son.

1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:36.480
And it's worked pretty well,
up until recently.

1:04:36.600 --> 1:04:40.160
It has. But something's changed, Peter.

1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:41.360
What's changed?

1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:48.760
What? You think it's me?

1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:51.920
Somewhere along the way,

1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:55.160
I lost the boy from the North Shore
I fell in love with.

1:04:55.640 --> 1:04:58.000
I couldn't stay a kid for ever, Mel.

1:04:58.640 --> 1:05:01.360
Not if I was gonna provide for this family
the way I have.

1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:03.480
Well, I would gladly give some of it back

1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:07.480
to spend one day
with the Pete Kapahaala who was so happy.

1:05:08.560 --> 1:05:10.480
Who loved life so much.

1:05:12.800 --> 1:05:15.400
Don't you think
you're being a little melodramatic?

1:05:17.920 --> 1:05:19.240
All I can say is,

1:05:20.520 --> 1:05:24.960
I can't sit by and watch you strip our son
of the same joy you used to have.

1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:39.760
Can you believe,
within this two-mile stretch of beach,

1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:42.560
there are 15
of the best waves in the world?

1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:45.040
-Hey.
-Hey!

1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:46.360
Hey, good morning.

1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:48.320
Hey, uh, Grandpa?

1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:51.280
You're not gonna send us back, are you?

1:05:51.360 --> 1:05:53.360
Yeah, Mr. Tsunami. I really like it here.

1:05:54.040 --> 1:05:57.120
Well if you two really wanna stay,
I'm not gonna stop you.

1:05:57.880 --> 1:05:59.160
Are you serious?

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.760
As far as I'm concerned,
you can crash here as long as you want.

1:06:02.840 --> 1:06:03.840
All right!

1:06:08.920 --> 1:06:11.800
-Hey, have fun today, man.
-Oh hey, Sam.

1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:14.040
You sure it's okay?
I can stay and teach you.

1:06:14.160 --> 1:06:17.120
Go for it. Your grandpa's
gonna have me riding before you get back.

1:06:17.200 --> 1:06:19.320
-Ready, Sam?
-Yeah, man.

1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:26.200
Johnny K! Hey, we heard you were back
but we didn't believe it!

1:06:26.280 --> 1:06:27.360
Hey, guys.

1:06:27.440 --> 1:06:29.000
It's like that movie<i> The Rock.</i>

1:06:29.080 --> 1:06:32.720
They're in that brutal prison
and they barely escape with their lives.

-You guys hear the report?
-Yeah, it's raging at Pipeline.

1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:39.960
Let's go before it gets zooed.

1:06:45.480 --> 1:06:46.520
Uh...

1:06:46.600 --> 1:06:49.640
Look, you guys go ahead.
I gotta take care of something.

1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:51.680
Yeah, right! Funny man.

1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:53.600
I'm serious.

1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:55.880
I'm staying.

1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:01.400
Oh! Hey, Pono!

1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:30.320

SAM: Man, that was so awesome!

1:07:34.320 --> 1:07:36.320
I wish my dad could have
been here to see me.

1:07:37.520 --> 1:07:40.320
Your dad would have been
plenty proud, Sam.

1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:44.760
(SIGHS) I can't believe
I ever left Hawaii.

1:07:46.440 --> 1:07:49.560
Yeah, sometimes I wish
I could have gone in your place, Pono.

1:07:49.840 --> 1:07:52.640
No way.
Why would you ever want to do that?

1:07:52.720 --> 1:07:54.440
Think about it.

1:07:54.520 --> 1:07:58.520
You always know you can ride waves
as good as anybody in the islands.

1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:03.880
But you, you got to go to a world
the complete opposite of here.

1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:04.960
You ride waves there?

1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:08.520
Grandpa, I'm pretty sure
there aren't any waves there.

1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:11.160
And... Well, at least I didn't see any.

1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:16.000
-You sure, now?
-Yeah, I've lived there for a while.

1:08:16.080 --> 1:08:18.680
And I'm pretty sure
Johnny's right on this one.

1:08:18.760 --> 1:08:20.640
There's no waves. No.

1:08:21.320 --> 1:08:24.640
Well, sometimes
they don't look like waves, Sam.

1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:27.800
Sometimes they look like mounds of snow

1:08:27.920 --> 1:08:30.720
and sometimes they look like
things you don't like to do.

1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:32.440
I think what my grandpa's trying to say

1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:36.160
is that you gotta deal with
everything that's happening.

1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:38.640
You know, kinda like a raging swell.

1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:40.760
Yeah. Something like that.

1:08:40.840 --> 1:08:42.280
(ALL LAUGHING)

1:08:44.200 --> 1:08:46.480
Mr T, is it all right if I go call my dad?

1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:48.000
Sure. Help yourself, Sam.

1:08:57.480 --> 1:09:00.720
It's a righteous thing you did, Pono.
Staying, helping your friend.

1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:04.800
Well that's what you would have done.

1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:08.960
You know, Poppy says I get
more and more like you every day.

1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:11.520
-That's what you want?
-Oh, sure.

1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:15.720
-That's okay, isn't it?
-Yeah.

1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:19.120
But I'm not perfect, Pono.

1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:22.760
But I guess you heard that
somewhere before!

1:09:22.840 --> 1:09:23.840
Grandpa...

1:09:25.160 --> 1:09:26.800
Look, don't get me wrong, Pono.

1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:31.560
I'm proud that you want to bring
big-wave glory to the family name.

1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:33.800
But I want you to find your own dreams.

1:09:34.600 --> 1:09:36.840
I guarantee, when you do,

1:09:36.920 --> 1:09:39.360
it'll be far better
than anything I ever did.

1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:43.520
(CHUCKLES)

1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:46.280
Is Sam still asleep?

1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:50.120
Guess that lesson yesterday
must have taken a lot out of him.

1:09:50.200 --> 1:09:51.200
Yeah.

1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:54.000
Grandpa?

1:09:54.880 --> 1:09:57.720
When I was first learning how to surf,
was I any good?

1:09:58.600 --> 1:10:00.600
(LAUGHING) What? You don't remember?

1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:03.600
-Not really. I was kinda little.
-Yeah.

1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:05.880
Well, Pono...

1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:08.840
It wasn't a pretty sight.

1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:12.520
It took you a long time to get up,

1:10:12.600 --> 1:10:15.440
but you never gave up,
and that's what counts.

1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:20.040
It's just like, everything back
in Vermont is just so hard.

1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:26.560
Well, for some people
that'd be reason enough to stay here.

1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:30.480
It's probably a better reason to go back,
though, isn't it?

1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:33.520
(EXCLAIMS) Pono!

1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:36.760
This is one of those times
I'm certain you're my grandson!

1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:40.440
So you're not mad at me, then?

1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:43.000
Nah. No way!

1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:49.120
In fact, you remember I said
I wanna go in your place?

1:10:49.720 --> 1:10:51.080
Yeah...

1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:53.720
(LAUGHING)

1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:57.280
LADY: Watch your step.

1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:02.560
Whoa, it's beautiful!

1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.920
You can do this place justice, Pono.

-Hey, Pete.
-Dad.

1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:26.880
You could have just put 'em on a plane.

1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:29.280
What, and miss this look on your face?

1:11:29.360 --> 1:11:31.040
Hey! How are you?

1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:33.440
-Is this us? Okay.
-Yeah.

1:11:34.480 --> 1:11:38.080
So, uh... You must be really mad at me.
Aren't you?

1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:39.560
We'll talk about it later.

1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:42.640
Once I get over the shock
of seeing your grandfather.

1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:48.480
GRANDPA: You know, Pono,

1:11:49.440 --> 1:11:52.680
I think the stars are even brighter here
than back home at Kīlauea.

1:11:54.760 --> 1:11:56.360
Yeah, they are.

1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:03.560
Well, better get to bed now.

1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:06.800
You better rest up.
We got a big day tomorrow.

1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:07.880
We do?

1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:11.440
Wat? You think I came all this way to sit
on a porch and look at stars with you?

1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:15.200
-Good night, Pono.
-Good night, Grandpa.

1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:23.120
-Night, Pop.
-Night.

1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:40.480
How did you get him to come home?

1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:44.120
I didn't have to do much, Pete. Smart kid.

1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.200
More like his father
than he'll ever admit.

1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:52.800
Well, whatever you did... I appreciate it.

1:12:56.760 --> 1:12:59.840
I really thought moving here
was gonna be the best for him.

1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:03.080
I wanted to give him a great opportunity.

1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:05.360
Know why you did it?

1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:07.840
You didn't want him to end up like me.

1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:11.080
-That's not true, Dad.
-Ah...

1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:13.120
'Course it is.

1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:14.800
It's okay.

1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:16.720
-Dad, listen...
-Look.

1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:17.880
He's just a kid.

1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:20.680
But a kid who does something
better than just about anybody.

1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:24.200
You take that away from him,
you take away part of him.

1:13:24.880 --> 1:13:27.680
I never had the passion for surfing
like you or Johnny.

1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:29.440
Well maybe it skips a generation.

1:13:30.120 --> 1:13:31.800
Your grandfather couldn't even swim!

1:13:36.080 --> 1:13:38.760
If I could go back,
there's a lot of things

1:13:38.840 --> 1:13:41.000
I would have done
to be a better father to you.

1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:43.000
But there's one thing I wouldn't change
no matter what.

1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:44.520
What's that?

1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:52.040
You know when you quit surfing?

1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:55.560
To me that was like quitting school.

1:13:56.280 --> 1:14:00.000
No matter how much I wanted
to force you back in the water, I didn't.

1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:02.520
It's good that you didn't.

1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:05.840
-Nothing could have changed my mind.
-Exactly.

1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:09.760
Like nothing's gonna change Johnny's.
He's gonna do what he's gonna do.

1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:12.880
With our blood running through him,

1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:15.360
not even Kamehameha could stop him, uh?

1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:21.680
What's done is done between us.

1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:24.280
But I'm proud of you, son.

1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:29.440
I just hope you'll be proud of Johnny
when the time comes.

1:15:11.880 --> 1:15:13.200
Maybe we should get home.

1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:15.720
I mean, I'm still supposed to be grounded,

1:15:16.280 --> 1:15:18.600
and I'm for sure not supposed
to be over here.

1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:22.800
Did your dad ever teach you
to listen to your elders, Pono?

1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:26.520
-Yeah.
-I'm definitely your elder. So listen up.

1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:28.360
I'll take care of your dad.

1:15:28.440 --> 1:15:31.760
You just worry about showing me
the best run in the mountains, okay?

1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:33.600
-You got it, Grandpa.
-Okay.

1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:35.600

Not a problem.

1:15:52.680 --> 1:15:57.560
May I say, it is completely out of control
to have you in my humble establishment.

1:15:57.880 --> 1:16:01.480
Sorry I don't carry any surf gear,
but we don't get much call.

1:16:01.960 --> 1:16:04.680
But you can help us with snowboards, eh?

1:16:04.760 --> 1:16:06.640
Oh, this is epic!

Don't worry about me.
Just see if you can keep up.

1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:42.920

Nice to meet you, Brett.

Yeah, well, don't even think about
going down this trail.

1:18:24.720 --> 1:18:27.360
-You have a right to do that, Brett?
-You're right. I do.

Of course. Until someone else
earns their place, that is.

1:18:31.960 --> 1:18:34.160
Newsflash for you, Gramps.
That's never gonna happen.

1:18:34.240 --> 1:18:36.680
You see, this side of the mountain's
for skiers only.

1:18:36.760 --> 1:18:39.120
You know, the sport with two boards,
poles, and no tattoos.

1:18:39.440 --> 1:18:41.880
-And you think that's fair?
-Sounds fair to me, Hawaii.

1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:45.120
I mean, you get to hang with your brahs
in the snowboarding park out of the way,

Hey, you know, back on the island,
we used to have this contest.

1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:06.960
The best surfer from each group
would catch a wave,

1:19:07.040 --> 1:19:09.920
and whoever got the best ride
got to keep the beach for the day.

1:19:10.960 --> 1:19:12.080
So how about it, Brett?

1:19:12.160 --> 1:19:15.480
I'll race you from the
cornice to the bottom. Just you and me.

-Yeah, right!
-No lie, dude.

1:19:17.640 --> 1:19:20.160
If you win,
the boarders stay off your side for ever.

1:19:20.240 --> 1:19:24.320
But if I win, we share the mountain.
All of it.

1:19:24.400 --> 1:19:26.840
That's stupid. If I win,
things stay just like they are right now.

with your grandfather today?

Um...

1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:01.480
Yeah. Look. I know
I'm supposed to be grounded, Dad...

1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:02.560
Listen, Johnny.

1:21:03.680 --> 1:21:06.200
Why don't we just
forget about the grounding?

1:21:06.280 --> 1:21:09.040
-Really?
-Really.

1:21:11.960 --> 1:21:17.120
Pop, I know I messed up.
With the fighting and the running away.

1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:19.560
I don't know what happened
or why I did it,

1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:22.160
but things will be different from now on.

1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:24.560
And I'm really sorry.

1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:28.880
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

1:21:29.400 --> 1:21:30.400
You?

1:21:31.440 --> 1:21:32.440
Yeah.

1:21:33.760 --> 1:21:36.720
I never could have imagined
how tough it would be on you.

Moving here, leaving home.

1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:41.760
It's not that bad.

Johnny...

1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:51.280
I know you may find this hard to believe,
but your dear old dad isn't perfect.

1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:54.560
-Sure you want to admit this?
-(BOTH LAUGH)

1:21:54.880 --> 1:21:58.880
Believe me, the older you get,
the harder it is to admit.

And, um...

1:22:02.240 --> 1:22:04.000
The harder it is to apologize.

1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:10.680
So, if there's anything I can do
to make it up to you...

1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:16.080
Well, there is this race tomorrow.
It's something I really wanna do.

1:22:16.160 --> 1:22:17.760
If it's okay with you, that is.

1:22:19.480 --> 1:22:20.760
As long as you win.

1:22:20.840 --> 1:22:22.320
(BOTH LAUGH)

1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:25.120
That medallion
needs to stay in the family.

1:22:25.200 --> 1:22:26.360
Hey. You know?

1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:33.400
-Now go wash up for dinner, huh?
-All right.

1:22:42.280 --> 1:22:45.440
I need an eight-letter word for "miracle".

1:22:47.920 --> 1:22:48.920
Very funny.

1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:52.480
Sounds like you reached a treaty.

1:22:54.240 --> 1:22:55.240
We did.

1:22:58.680 --> 1:22:59.880
Was it painful?

1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:09.440
Only when I think of all the time
I've missed with my amazing son.

1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:24.840
GIRL: Oh, Brett! You own this mountain.

1:23:26.120 --> 1:23:27.560
I'm gonna put some money down on you.

1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:30.320
BOY: Forget those Urchins.

1:23:35.880 --> 1:23:38.720
So. You here for Brett?

1:23:39.640 --> 1:23:43.040
Not really.
Mostly I wanted to apologize to you.

1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:44.960
For what?

1:23:45.120 --> 1:23:47.480
My dad finally admitted you tried to take
the blame for what happened.

1:23:47.560 --> 1:23:48.600
Emily, look--

1:23:48.680 --> 1:23:50.560
Now I realize what
you were trying to tell me the other day.

1:23:50.640 --> 1:23:52.080
I should have listened to you.

1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:53.160
-It's okay, really.
-It's just that

1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:55.200
after you went to my dad,
he got even madder.

1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:57.760
And he and Brett and everyone
were telling me to stay away from you.

1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:01.640
Emily. Look, it's okay.

1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:03.520
Believe me,
I understand when your dad wants you

1:24:03.600 --> 1:24:05.720
to do something
that you really don't want to do.

1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:08.080
You're really sweet.

1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.040
Well, good luck.

1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:14.120
And be careful.

1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:16.280
Yeah. I will.

1:24:16.360 --> 1:24:17.360
Okay.

1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:21.720
SAM: Hey, Urchin!

1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:26.400
What happened?
I thought you were gone already.

1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:29.360
Sarge got his orders changed
when he realized how epic this all was.

1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:31.280
We leave in the morning!

1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:34.440
Hey, got your stick, dude.
Prepped and ready to rock.

1:24:34.520 --> 1:24:38.640
I even used a special wax
in my private stock. Totally nectar.

1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:42.240
You haven't seen nectar
until you've seen these.

1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:44.200
Hello, Randy.

1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:46.480
Hey, Ronnie.

1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:49.160
Wait a minute. You guys... Are you...

1:24:49.240 --> 1:24:51.280
Are we gonna do this or what, Urchin?

1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:55.600
-Hey, you the man.
-After you.

1:24:57.080 --> 1:24:59.480
-Great day for this.
-Hey, there he is.

1:24:59.680 --> 1:25:00.800
Hey, Pono!

1:25:03.200 --> 1:25:04.840
<i>Pomaika'i,</i>  Brett.

1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:08.320
-What's that? Some Hawaiian swear word?
-It means good luck.

1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:12.320
Oh. Well, pomi-whatever to you too.

1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:13.920
Look, first one to the bottom
of the mountain

1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:15.880
through all the gates
and the train park wins.

1:25:16.280 --> 1:25:18.080
-You ready?
-Say the word.

1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:19.920
See you at the bottom, loser.

1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:22.680
Whoo-hoo!

1:26:09.760 --> 1:26:11.440
JOHNNY: Dude, lay off! Whoa!

1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:32.760
(BOTH GRUNTING)

1:26:45.800 --> 1:26:47.800
-Hey, get off, man.
-Get out of my way, Hawaii.

1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:51.320
BOTH: Whoa!

1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:03.280
(STRAINS)

1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:15.160
-This is mine, Urchin.
-Not a chance, Brett.

1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:34.360
(ALL CHEERING)

1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:40.600
-Hey, Brett, you all right?
-I'm fine. Back off!

1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:44.080
Yeah! That was amazing, man!

1:27:44.800 --> 1:27:47.840
You rode the wave, Pono.
The medallion is yours.

1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:50.320
MAN: Boarders rule.

1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:55.800
Emily, what are you doing?
He's still an Urchin.

1:27:55.920 --> 1:27:58.520
He won, Brett. He earned it.

1:27:59.200 --> 1:28:01.240
She's right. It's over, Brett.

1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:05.480
(ALL CHEERING)

1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:07.120
GIRL: Don't be such a baby, Brett.

1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:11.760
We're gonna have a big party
at our house this afternoon,

1:28:11.840 --> 1:28:13.800
and everyone's invited!

1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:16.120
(CHEERING)

1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:30.080
You know, your dad and I were talking
last night and we came to a decision.

1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:31.200
About what?

1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:34.000
We decided that if you want,

1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:36.280
you can go back to Hawaii
with your grandfather

1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:38.200
and spend the rest
of the school year there.

1:28:38.280 --> 1:28:39.280
Cool.

1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:41.200
-For real?
-For real.

1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:47.040
Well, it's not so bad here.

1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:49.800
And I think I'd miss you guys too much.

1:28:53.440 --> 1:28:55.200
I told you he was smart, eh, Pete?

1:28:55.880 --> 1:29:00.560
And besides, the Urchins may need me.
You know, in case Brett wants a rematch.

1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:04.840
Hey, Johnny, dude, that was killer.

1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:06.960
-We just wanna thank you.
-For what?

1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:09.280
For showing us
how bogus this whole fight's been.

1:29:09.360 --> 1:29:12.000
Brothers shouldn't go so many years
without speaking.

1:29:12.080 --> 1:29:15.680
No matter how, uh... Different they are.

1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:17.240
No way. You guys are brothers?

1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:21.000
Dude. You're looking at the last remaining
original Sky and Urchin.

1:29:21.080 --> 1:29:22.720
When we were kids, our folks split up.

1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:25.760
I went to Skyline,
Randy went to Maple Valley.

1:29:25.880 --> 1:29:28.840
Yeah, ten years ago, our Pop passed away
and left us the mountain.

1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:29.920
Split it down the middle.

1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:33.320
-Boarders on my side.
-And skiers on mine.

1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:34.640
It's been that way ever since,

1:29:34.720 --> 1:29:37.240
but we think it's time
to put things back together.

1:29:37.400 --> 1:29:41.920
That's why next month will be the grand
opening of Edison Brothers' Air Summit.

1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:44.640
All access for everyone, all the time.

1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:48.160
That's pretty catchy, bro.
Did you come up with that?

1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:52.680
I knew you'd win all along.

1:29:52.760 --> 1:29:53.760
Well...

1:29:54.760 --> 1:29:57.440
Think the world's ready
for the next Johnny Tsunami?

1:29:58.400 --> 1:30:00.840
Well, I think they'd better be, Grandpa.

1:30:00.960 --> 1:30:02.040
(GRANDPA EXCLAIMS)

1:30:03.600 --> 1:30:05.600
(SLOW DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
