I want my friends!

42:49.905 --> 42:53.809
I gotta go to the police,
have those two arrested.

42:53.842 --> 42:56.712
I have to find out
what they've done
with my friends.

42:56.745 --> 42:58.781
Oh, my God! What‐‐
What am I doing here?

42:58.814 --> 43:01.918
What's wrong with me?
They're getting away
as we speak.

43:01.951 --> 43:04.387
No, they're not
goin' anywhere.

43:04.420 --> 43:06.389
You don't worry about that.

43:06.422 --> 43:11.060
‐ Distributor cap's gone.
‐ Shit!

43:11.094 --> 43:13.162
Great. What the hell
are we gonna do, you guys?

43:13.196 --> 43:15.564
‐ It's gotta be Dale.
‐ That guy's probably
awake by now.

43:15.598 --> 43:17.566
No, no, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay.

43:17.600 --> 43:21.637
It's okay 'cause, um‐‐
'cause your dad
has a plan.

Great.

43:45.361 --> 43:48.731

‐ Hey, Pete.

43:48.764 --> 43:52.568
Let me come with you...
to the police.

43:52.601 --> 43:55.204
What, are you gonna
walk, Pete?

43:55.238 --> 43:58.942
I mean, I'm just a handyman,
but it seems to me...

43:58.975 --> 44:01.244
that the right thing
to do here is to help.

44:01.277 --> 44:04.280
So let me drive you.

44:04.313 --> 44:06.615
I got a car.
You don't.

44:08.584 --> 44:10.586
Okay.

44:10.619 --> 44:12.922
Thank you.

44:12.956 --> 44:14.958
Yes, drive me.

44:14.991 --> 44:16.993
I'm sorry.
I'm not myself.
