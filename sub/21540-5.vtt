-<i>Previously on "Million Dollar</i>
<i>Listing New York"...  </i>

00:05.038 --> 00:06.740
- Got an offer.
- I've got an offer too.

00:06.773 --> 00:07.907
- I want full price.

00:07.941 --> 00:10.677
- That's 25,000 under
the full ask.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.213
- I agree.
- Ah! Yes!

00:13.246 --> 00:15.482
- This is the greatest townhouse
in the history of man.

00:15.515 --> 00:18.284
- We thought 20 million would
really be the going price.

00:18.318 --> 00:19.853
- No.
- No?

00:19.886 --> 00:22.055
- They can't do it at 20.

00:22.088 --> 00:23.523
Hey, Ward, how are you?

00:26.726 --> 00:29.429
- I think I should hold back
a certain number of units.

00:29.462 --> 00:30.563
<i>- You what?</i>

00:30.597 --> 00:31.865
I'm gonna pretend
I never heard it.

00:31.898 --> 00:33.833
You can't take away units
that I already sold.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.435
- Fredrik, I'm not changing.

00:35.468 --> 00:37.404
<i>- It's not about the money</i>
<i>or the commission record.</i>

00:37.437 --> 00:40.573
I have to put my foot down.

00:40.607 --> 00:43.143
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

00:43.176 --> 00:45.979
-<i>I've conquered New York,</i>
<i>but I'm not stopping there.</i>

00:46.012 --> 00:48.648
<i>No boundaries,</i>
<i>no limits, no problem.</i>

00:48.682 --> 00:51.484
<i>- The most important thing</i>
<i>to me is moving forward.</i>

00:51.518 --> 00:53.753
<i>I'm all about the journey,</i>
<i>not the trophy.</i>

00:53.787 --> 00:55.755
<i>- I'm the top dog</i>
<i>in real estate.</i>

00:55.789 --> 00:57.490
<i>I fetch deals all day long,</i>

00:57.524 --> 00:59.559
<i>but then I come home</i>
<i>for a treat.</i>

00:59.592 --> 01:00.927
I didn't steal your clients,
they came to me.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.829
- I worked really damn hard
to get here.

01:02.862 --> 01:04.931
I'm not gonna have
somebody like you steal from me.

01:04.964 --> 01:06.933
- You're not gonna disrespect me
ever again.

01:17.711 --> 01:21.715
- What in the f***?
This is all 87th Street?

01:21.748 --> 01:24.451
- Yes, that's what the
inspectors came back with.

01:24.484 --> 01:29.289
- My new listing on 87th Street
has just turned into a disaster.

01:29.322 --> 01:34.894
<i>It's an amazing seven-story,</i>
<i>8,400-square-foot townhouse</i>

01:34.928 --> 01:36.262
<i>on the Upper West Side.</i>

01:36.296 --> 01:38.465
So you listed it for 18
3 1/2 years ago.

01:38.498 --> 01:39.966
- Basically.
- Right.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.437
The problem is, it's actually
too big for New York buyers,

01:44.471 --> 01:47.640
<i>so I recruited my team members</i>
<i>from other cities</i>

01:47.674 --> 01:52.245
that feature big houses,
and Sebastian has a buyer.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.648
That buyer demanded
an inspection

01:55.682 --> 01:57.283
before he would even
make an offer.

01:59.819 --> 02:01.121
- Well, that's
a different story.

02:01.154 --> 02:03.957
<i>And now that inspection report</i>
<i>has come back,</i>

02:04.057 --> 02:05.859
<i>and it's not a report.</i>

02:05.892 --> 02:07.160
It is a novel.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.895
[phone trilling]
Ay-yi-yi.

02:10.497 --> 02:13.967
- Hey, Ward, it's Ryan.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.669
- So much.

02:15.702 --> 02:20.407
First, we are expecting
an offer, which is awesome.

02:20.440 --> 02:23.710
There's a lot of, like, little
stuff they want fixed.

02:23.743 --> 02:26.646
Nothing crazy, it's like
$25,000, something like that.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.496
- Mm-hmm, yes.

02:43.530 --> 02:47.367
It's annoying, I know,
but we do this stuff,

02:47.400 --> 02:49.302
then they will absolutely
make an offer,

02:49.336 --> 02:50.570
and I think
we can get this done.

02:53.907 --> 02:57.777
- I get that Ward is mad,
but he needs to suck it up.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.046
<i>He's had this house on the</i>
<i>market for over three years,</i>

03:00.046 --> 03:03.683
and it's costing him money every
single month to carry the house.

03:03.717 --> 03:10.256
So spending $25,000 to make
$18 million is not that hard.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.835
- Okay, but--but the--

03:21.868 --> 03:24.437
Hello?
Did he just hang up?

03:24.471 --> 03:27.507
Did Ward just hang up?
[groans]

03:27.540 --> 03:30.076
God, you f***ing, sh**, ****.

03:32.779 --> 03:35.482

Okay,

03:35.515 --> 03:40.420
I have to learn to breathe
in moments of insane anger.

03:40.453 --> 03:42.122
Jordan, can you get me
Sebastian on the phone

03:42.155 --> 03:43.690
right now, please?
- Yeah.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.791
- I can't let this deal die

03:44.824 --> 03:46.893
over something so stupid
and so trivial.

03:46.926 --> 03:49.629
<i>[sighs]</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

04:02.375 --> 04:04.511

but I'll make the phone call.

04:04.544 --> 04:07.313
I'll see if we can get it.

04:07.347 --> 04:08.882
'Sup handsome?
- Good morning.

04:08.915 --> 04:09.916
How you doing?
- Very good.

04:09.949 --> 04:11.051
- Great to see you.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.218
- What was so urgent
that you had to stop me

04:12.252 --> 04:13.720
in the middle of trading?

04:13.753 --> 04:15.689
- Something very--Oh, it's
something very, very special.

04:15.722 --> 04:17.557
Dennis
is the financial advisor

04:17.590 --> 04:19.626
for a very big investor
named Ben,

04:19.659 --> 04:21.561
who I've done deals with
in the past.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.064
If you find the right
opportunity, he will buy.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.666
If you find the right
opportunity again, he will buy.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.735
This is the kind of client
that will put your grandkids

04:28.768 --> 04:29.736
through college.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.804
Yeah,
so I'll get right to it.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.238
Listen, there's this
opportunity.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.475
This is gonna be the number one
building when it's built.

04:35.508 --> 04:37.444
Now, you remember the
St. John's building in Tribeca

04:37.477 --> 04:39.145
on Murray Street?

04:39.179 --> 04:40.780
- 111?
- Yes, 1--

04:40.814 --> 04:42.449
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we've read some amazing articles

04:42.482 --> 04:43.550
about the development team.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.185
- So all of it's amazing.

04:45.218 --> 04:49.356
<i>111 Murray, it's developed by</i>
<i>Fisher Brothers, Steve Witkoff,</i>

04:49.389 --> 04:51.725
and Howard Lorber,
the owner of my firm.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.593
Everybody in town wants to be--

04:53.626 --> 04:55.662
wants to bring
their clients here.

04:55.695 --> 05:00.200
I got access to come in before
they open the sales office.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.168
- So you're the first one in?
- Yes.

05:02.202 --> 05:03.503
- How'd you do that?

05:03.536 --> 05:06.272
- Because I'm a persistent
Puerto Rican.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.844
I called Howard every single day
for the past five months,

05:10.877 --> 05:12.245
and I kept on calling,
and I kept on calling,

05:12.278 --> 05:13.546
and I kept on calling,
and I kept on calling.

05:13.580 --> 05:14.581
And Howard's like,
"Stop calling me,

05:14.614 --> 05:15.782
stop calling me,
stop calling."

05:15.815 --> 05:16.883
And I kept on calling,
and I kept on calling,

05:16.916 --> 05:19.052
and one day he says
"All right, stop!

05:19.052 --> 05:23.590
Luis, yes, you can go in."

05:23.623 --> 05:24.891
And that's how I got it.

05:24.924 --> 05:27.694
And now I have to make sure
I do not let him down.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.629
So by being
the first ones there,

05:29.662 --> 05:33.833
we secure a unit at
the very, very, very first price

05:33.867 --> 05:35.969
in a building that everybody
will want to be a part of.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.070
- When do you want
to go look at it?

05:37.103 --> 05:38.471
- I have it next week,
Wednesday.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.874
- I'm booked solid.

05:40.907 --> 05:43.443
- There's no moving
appointments, like that is--

05:43.476 --> 05:44.744
if we don't go on Wednesday--

05:44.778 --> 05:46.913
- No way.

05:46.946 --> 05:48.448
- You don't understand.
If--

05:48.481 --> 05:50.316
Unless you're having
open-heart surgery--

05:50.350 --> 05:52.686
actually, even if you're having
open-heart surgery,

05:52.719 --> 05:55.855
you have surgery
at this meeting.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.457
At 12:00 p.m. Listen,
you have to make the effort.

05:57.490 --> 05:58.458
Trust me on this.

05:58.491 --> 06:02.095
<i>* *</i>

06:02.128 --> 06:03.563
- Okay, let's see if we got
Wednesday available.

06:03.596 --> 06:04.564
- All right, you got it,
beautiful, beautiful.

06:04.597 --> 06:05.799
- Thank you.

06:05.832 --> 06:07.100
- If I'm the first one
that comes in,

06:07.133 --> 06:08.368
and I bring
a qualified client

06:08.401 --> 06:10.136
that pulls the trigger
right then and there,

06:10.170 --> 06:12.472
it's a guarantee that every
other new development,

06:12.505 --> 06:15.308
they will call me knowing
that I have this kind of buyer.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.811
- Chris, clear up my schedule,
Wednesday, 12:00.

06:17.844 --> 06:19.746
<i>- I love it.</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>

- Mm-hmm?

06:29.456 --> 06:32.692
- This office is a real mess.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.795
- I think it shows
that it has character.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.831
- No, but you know my mom said
when I was a kid that, like,

06:37.864 --> 06:41.067
geniuses are always
messy people.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.970
And I kind of took that
to heart.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.406
[phone ringing]

06:46.439 --> 06:48.575
Oh, God, Mona.

06:48.608 --> 06:52.545
Mona's a client of mine--
I mean,<i>was</i>a client of mine.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.080
- Fredrik!
- Look at you.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.149
<i>She's the developer</i>
<i>of an amazing new building</i>

06:56.182 --> 06:57.150
<i>in Williamsburg.</i>

06:57.183 --> 06:58.818
<i>It's a 60-unit conversion</i>

06:58.852 --> 07:01.221
<i>with the most beautiful details</i>
<i>and finishes.</i>

07:01.254 --> 07:02.722
<i>I threw a huge event</i>

07:02.756 --> 07:06.026
in the hopes of selling out
about 10% the first night,

07:06.059 --> 07:09.829
until she told me she's gonna
hold back 12 units for herself.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.031
Which are you gonna take off?

07:11.031 --> 07:12.065
I'm getting offers.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.500
- We'll go through it.

07:13.533 --> 07:16.036
<i>- In the end,</i>
<i>there was nothing I could do,</i>

07:16.036 --> 07:18.405
but I asked her
that in the event

07:18.438 --> 07:21.708
she brings back the 12 units,
they have to go to me.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.043
- I'll discuss this with you

07:23.043 --> 07:24.678
when and if
you sell the project out.

07:24.711 --> 07:27.247
- But why am I not
getting paid commission?

07:27.280 --> 07:28.515
- Let it go right now.
- Get you to agree--

07:28.548 --> 07:33.219
No, tomorrow you're gonna hire
another broker.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.522
I had to quit the project,

07:35.555 --> 07:37.757
and you know how difficult
that is for me.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.192
There was no other way.

07:39.225 --> 07:41.227
Fredrik here.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.075
- Somewhat?

08:06.252 --> 08:07.253
- What?

08:15.562 --> 08:17.564
- You're giving me back
something that's crazy.

08:17.597 --> 08:20.033
I have to sell another 18 units
in two weeks.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.635
So this is how she's agreeing
to what I think is fair,

08:22.669 --> 08:24.270
by upping the odds,

08:24.304 --> 08:26.306
telling me,
"Yes, you can have the 12 units

08:26.339 --> 08:28.308
<i>if you sell half</i>
<i>in two weeks?"</i>

08:34.514 --> 08:35.749
<i>- This is the thing</i>
<i>with developers,</i>

08:35.782 --> 08:37.951
they think it's like these
offers just, like,

08:38.051 --> 08:40.687
miraculously...[hums]
come down from the sky.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.656
- Wait, I--

08:43.690 --> 08:45.625
- Mona, Mona, Mona,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.060
- Oh, my God, I can't.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.329
I never win.
I never win.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.599
It's like because
I'm selling so many,

08:52.632 --> 08:55.235
I always get penalized.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.103
Sorry, what?

08:57.137 --> 08:58.838
- Mona, Mona, Mona,
Mona, Mona, Mona.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.073
First,
I want to say this first:

09:00.106 --> 09:05.011
I do appreciate you taking time
and reconsidering.

09:05.011 --> 09:08.481
So I...

09:08.515 --> 09:10.850
accept.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.119
<i>At some point,</i>
<i>it's not about her anymore.</i>

09:13.153 --> 09:15.155
From the very beginning,
I took on this project

09:15.188 --> 09:16.856
because I wanted
to prove myself

09:16.890 --> 09:18.692
in Williamsburg
in new development.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.026
I'm back on the project.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.228
Do I think I'm gonna make it?
No.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.564
Will I accept
and try my hardest?

09:24.597 --> 09:25.865
100% yes.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.635
But what you're asking from me
is impossible.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.472
- Here we go.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.640
<i>Get to work, Jordan.</i>

09:33.673 --> 09:34.941
<i>- Coming up...</i>

09:35.041 --> 09:36.543
- Luis, this is not
the time and place

09:36.576 --> 09:37.777
to be negotiating like that.

09:37.811 --> 09:38.912
- It's what my clients want.

and first--

09:56.563 --> 09:58.465
Look who it is!
- What's up, brother?

09:58.498 --> 09:59.599
- How was the flight?
- Not bad.

09:59.632 --> 10:00.767
What's going on?

10:00.800 --> 10:01.801
- What do you mean,
"What's going on?"

10:01.835 --> 10:05.972
Here's 30 pages
for a brand-new house.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.008
- Yeah,
and it's got to be done.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.242
It has to be done.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.879
- Sebastian's buyer is
a big entertainment CEO,

10:12.912 --> 10:16.549
<i>and it is super important</i>
<i>that I make him happy.</i>

10:16.583 --> 10:19.386
So I am willing to work
with them on a few things--

10:19.419 --> 10:21.621
not everything,
but a few things.

10:21.654 --> 10:23.556
You and I, that's why
we are a united front,

10:23.590 --> 10:25.358
and we have
to figure this out.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.360
<i>If that means I'm spending more</i>
<i>of my commission</i>

10:27.394 --> 10:30.130
when this deal goes through,
then so be it.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.099
I mean, there is nothing
worth losing a deal over.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.736
So number one:
"grouting at hearth."

10:36.770 --> 10:37.871
Like around here?

10:37.904 --> 10:41.141
- Yeah, right there,
and here on this side.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.442
- You don't even know.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.611
You know this is ridiculous.
Okay, okay, you know what?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.079
Do you know how you deal
with people like this?

10:46.112 --> 10:49.916
You kill bees with honey.

10:49.949 --> 10:51.651
Grout.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.953
"Sitting room floor
to be repaired."

10:53.987 --> 10:54.988
I think it looks fine.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.489
We should take this
off the list.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.024
- That...

10:58.058 --> 11:00.694
- This looks like flooring.
- That...this.

11:00.727 --> 11:01.695
- Fine, you know what?

11:01.728 --> 11:04.297
Bam, bam, that's teamwork.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.232
You're gonna do another one.
Great.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.101
I get that Sebastian
is being stubborn

11:08.134 --> 11:10.937
because he's representing
his client.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.539
- "Leaking shower."

11:12.572 --> 11:14.174
- But now this is just annoying.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.709
You seriously want to make
a big deal about this one?

11:15.742 --> 11:17.243
You don't want to just take
this one off the list?

11:17.277 --> 11:19.412
- What if somebody runs in
and slips and falls?

11:19.446 --> 11:20.880
- Who's running in
to slip and fall

11:20.914 --> 11:22.082
while you're taking a shower?
- Kids, I don't know.

11:22.115 --> 11:25.518
- Mmm, injured kids.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.554
<i>Sounds like a lawsuit.</i>

11:30.323 --> 11:33.493
- Boom, boom.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.961
<i>- If this deal goes through,</i>

11:34.994 --> 11:39.366
I will have lost $25,000
of my commission.

11:39.399 --> 11:40.734
<i>But that's okay.</i>

11:40.767 --> 11:44.404
I'll just dry my tears
with the other $1/2 million.

11:44.437 --> 11:48.508
Oh, my God,
all the pink stickies.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.511
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

11:51.544 --> 11:57.784
<i>* *</i>

11:57.817 --> 12:00.220
- Mona's given me
an impossible task:

12:00.253 --> 12:02.856
<i>18 units in 14 days,</i>

12:02.889 --> 12:07.193
<i>but I don't have time</i>
<i>to whine and complain.</i>

12:07.227 --> 12:08.328
Just got to do it.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.896
That's pretty good.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.832
I did an insane
digital advertisement package

12:12.866 --> 12:14.734
for this building, I mean, more
than I've ever done in my life.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.169
And there's this new banner
that I love.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.772
Basically it works like this:
you visit my website once

12:18.805 --> 12:20.807
<i>and then wherever</i>
<i>you go the internet,</i>

12:20.840 --> 12:22.909
<i>it doesn't matter where,</i>
<i>you can buy underwear, a bra,</i>

12:22.942 --> 12:25.245
<i>my building shows up</i>
<i>on the websites.</i>

12:25.278 --> 12:26.713
It follows you around.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.947
It's actually kind of scary,
but good for me,

12:27.981 --> 12:30.083
because, trust me,
it's working.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.988
- Hello, hi.
- Hey, Fredrik, how are you?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.589
- Good to see you, welcome.

12:36.623 --> 12:40.727
<i>We're in 3C: South-facing,</i>
<i>two-bedroom, 1,206 square feet,</i>

12:40.760 --> 12:42.696
1.425,
and I'm telling you right now,

12:42.729 --> 12:44.597
this is where everybody
wants to be.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.099
Hi, welcome.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.134
<i>Because of a time crunch</i>
<i>I am doubling up--</i>

12:48.168 --> 12:49.602
<i>actually, I am tripling up.</i>

12:49.636 --> 12:50.870
And I love the brass detail.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.339
Look here.
Isn't it gorgeous?

12:52.372 --> 12:54.107
You have buyers;
I know you have buyers.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.475
<i>I have to talk fast here.</i>

12:55.508 --> 12:57.310
I mean, I have 20 brokers coming
today, 30 brokers tomorrow.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.678
I don't have time
for pleasant conversation

12:58.712 --> 12:59.913
quick, quick, quick, quick,
quick.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.681
Two bedroom, two bath;
let's go see the master.

13:01.715 --> 13:04.317
Developers never ever put in
beautiful closets like this.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.386
And then I love this;
this is custom by Paris.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.887
- How high are the ceilings,
actually?

13:07.921 --> 13:09.656
- Probably 11.
- Okay.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.057
- We have a penthouse
for $5 million.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.759
It has multiple terraces,
amazing view.

13:12.792 --> 13:13.793
Do you want to go up?

13:13.827 --> 13:16.062
I see a smile.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.831
- Whoo-hoo!

13:17.864 --> 13:19.799
- It's not done.
- That's good.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.167
You need to--you need to,
you know,

13:21.201 --> 13:23.103
get your mortgage in order,
all that paperwork.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.904
It takes two or three months
to get the money ready.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.139
In two months it'll be done.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.741
<i>I don't have time</i>
<i>for negative.</i>

13:27.774 --> 13:28.908
<i>I don't like negativity.</i>

13:28.942 --> 13:30.210
Criticism to me is like
a boomerang.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.112
You just throw it away,
but it always comes back

13:32.145 --> 13:33.446
for me as a positive.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.647
- Is there parking
in the building?

13:34.681 --> 13:35.782
- No, no parking.
- No parking.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.517
- But you see,
park right there.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.085
- Absolutely.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.087
- What about the noise?
- What noise?

13:41.121 --> 13:42.722
Oh, you mean
the voices inside saying,

13:42.756 --> 13:44.391
"Sold out, sold out, sold out."

13:44.424 --> 13:46.159
- No, from the bridge.
- The bridge right here.

13:46.192 --> 13:47.327
- I love this bridge.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.596
You know some people buy
$40 million sculptures

13:49.629 --> 13:50.997
to have in their apartments.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.799
I would just buy this apartment
and look at this sculpture.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.601
[laughter]

13:54.634 --> 13:56.903
Get your buyers in line,
and get me some offers.

13:56.936 --> 13:59.305
Let's do this, people.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.341
<i>Hi.</i>

14:01.374 --> 14:04.344
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

<i>- He's gonna be excited.</i>

14:08.081 --> 14:09.482
<i>- He's gonna be very excited.</i>

14:09.516 --> 14:10.617
<i>- Just so you know,</i>
<i>this building,</i>

14:10.650 --> 14:12.952
this will be
the most exclusive building

14:13.053 --> 14:15.088
<i>that's ever been built</i>
<i>in the city.</i>

14:15.121 --> 14:16.089
- Maybe we can
make something happen.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.558
- Oh, yes.

14:18.591 --> 14:19.859
- Here, boss.
- Thanks, Jay.

14:19.893 --> 14:23.063
111 Murray is located
in the southwest of Tribeca,

14:23.063 --> 14:25.932
<i>right next to the greenery</i>
<i>of Battery Park,</i>

14:25.965 --> 14:28.168
<i>but it still has</i>
<i>the charm of Tribeca.</i>

14:29.769 --> 14:30.804
All right.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.405
<i>The site</i>
<i>has not been built yet,</i>

14:32.439 --> 14:35.842
<i>so the developer chose</i>
<i>a nearby office building</i>

14:35.875 --> 14:38.645
to put the entire sales office.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.080
- Luis, how's it going?
- Yes, good morning.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.481
- Good morning. How are you?
- Good to see you.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.249
This is Denny Serero.
- Hi, Peter Zaiteff.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.684
Nice to meet you.
- Thank you very much.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.253
We are the first people to ever
get into the sales office.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.421
- I'm excited.
- Thank you for that.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.989
- Okay, great.
We all set?

14:50.090 --> 14:52.459
- Yup.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.728
- Welcome to 111 Murray.
- Wow.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.263
- Ah, yes!

14:57.297 --> 15:01.501
This--this--it's how you build
a sales office.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.770
How long does it take to make
something like this?

15:03.803 --> 15:08.041
- Like, six months
and probably $400,000.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.309
- $400,000?

15:09.342 --> 15:10.510
We are in the wrong business.

15:10.543 --> 15:14.147
- [laughs] Yeah.
- That's amazing.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.849
- So this is it, 111 Murray.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.951
It's 64 stories.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.620
There's 157 units
in the building.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.289
From the 44th floor up,

15:23.323 --> 15:24.824
it's only two apartments
per floor,

15:24.858 --> 15:26.760
so it's gonna feel
very private.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.128
- Once every decade,

15:28.161 --> 15:30.630
<i>there is this building</i>
<i>that's built</i>

15:30.663 --> 15:32.265
<i>that changes</i>
<i>the skyline of New York</i>

15:32.298 --> 15:35.435
and defines what
luxury buildings are all about.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.637
- There's over 20,000
square feet of amenities

15:37.671 --> 15:40.073
in the building:
75-foot lap pool,

15:40.106 --> 15:43.576
<i>3,000-square-foot gym,</i>
<i>and media room.</i>

15:43.610 --> 15:48.181
We also have
a fully built-out sales model.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.383
- Wow.
- [laughing]

15:50.417 --> 15:53.887
- Huge views out to the West
over the Hudson River.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.488
- I mean, come on.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.923
What floor are we on--
well, pretending to be?

15:56.956 --> 16:00.393
- So we are on
the 44th floor here.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.028
- This is amazing.
- This is beautiful.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.497
- The real thing is only gonna
be ten times better than this.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.901
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

16:07.934 --> 16:10.203
- Custom herringbone floor
pattern and stain,

16:10.236 --> 16:12.205
Borghini Calacatta stone,

16:12.238 --> 16:15.275
Travertine backsplash,
free-standing soaking tub.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.576
- This is beautiful.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.912
- The developer
is putting $5 million

16:18.945 --> 16:20.347
<i>just on the sales gallery.</i>

16:20.380 --> 16:22.716
I mean, that tells you
the level of quality

16:22.749 --> 16:24.517
<i>this building will deliver.</i>

16:24.551 --> 16:26.553
- So the unit that we're
actually in right now

16:26.586 --> 16:30.557
is 44 West,
priced at $7.8 million.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.058
Is that in your...

16:32.092 --> 16:36.596
- My clients, you know, give me
the access to go up to 13.5.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.099
- Wow, this is amazing.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.567
I sent Ben a couple of ranges

16:40.600 --> 16:41.868
of different units
in this building,

16:41.901 --> 16:45.372
but I had no idea he was going
to pick the big one.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.674
- Do you have it?
- I can show it to you.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.976
- Big, fat check.
Ha!

16:50.076 --> 16:53.079
- So here we're around 500 feet
in the air.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.882
- This is gonna be
close to 700 feet.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.083
- And this is the five bedroom.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.518
- This is the one.
- Okay.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.587
- This is definitely the one.
- What is the price on this?

17:00.620 --> 17:05.358
- It's Schedule A price:
It's 13,750,000.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.127
- My client authorized me
to go up to 13.5.

17:07.160 --> 17:12.332
That's our limit.
That's where we're going.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.833
- You're here the first day,

17:13.867 --> 17:17.037
and there's only six of these
units in the whole building.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.938
- Every buyer
always wants to negotiate,

17:19.039 --> 17:20.707
<i>but sometimes there are places</i>

17:20.740 --> 17:23.043
that are just like
the f***ing store,

17:23.076 --> 17:27.681
where you just got to go to the
register and pay the tag price.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.816
- No way.
My client wants to stay at 13.5.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.384
- I don't think
that's gonna work.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.089
<i>- Coming up...</i>

17:36.122 --> 17:38.491
- 15.5 U.S. dollars?

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

17:48.935 --> 17:51.838

and there's only six of these
units in the whole building.

17:55.709 --> 17:56.710
- Okay.
- No way.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.812
My client
wants to stay at 13.5.

17:58.845 --> 18:03.049
- I don't think
that's gonna work.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.851
- Can--do you--can I have a
minute with my client, please?

18:04.884 --> 18:07.620
- Sure, absolutely.
- Thank you.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.023
All right, just so you know,

18:10.023 --> 18:12.592
they're not gonna take anything
else than Schedule A.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.027
I mean,
we're gonna look like a joke.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.028
- What's Schedule A?
Explain that to me.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.163
- Schedule A is the first price

18:17.197 --> 18:19.265
that's submitted on the offering
plan to the Attorney General.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.067
As soon
as they start selling units,

18:21.101 --> 18:24.204
they will amend the prices,
and the prices will go up.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.372
This is the bottom bottom,

18:25.405 --> 18:28.041
like, this is--we cannot go
lower than this.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.242
- I understand, Luis.
Listen,

18:29.275 --> 18:30.910
you know my client
just as well as I do.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.412
He wants to negotiate.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.546
He put a price in mind,

18:33.580 --> 18:34.814
and he won't stop
till he gets that.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.216
This is why we hired you.

18:36.249 --> 18:39.052
- It's actually very hard
to find a client

18:39.052 --> 18:41.087
that will pay
this amount of money

18:41.121 --> 18:43.890
<i>right off the bat</i>
<i>without asking any questions.</i>

18:43.923 --> 18:47.293
And I know Ben, and I know
that he likes to negotiate,

18:47.327 --> 18:50.063
but I swear that I thought

18:50.063 --> 18:52.065
that this
was the kind of project

18:52.098 --> 18:54.334
where he understood not to.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.735
- You've got to get this done.

18:55.769 --> 18:58.872
- I understand, but right now
if we walk away from this

18:58.905 --> 19:00.206
and they open the doors to the
rest of the brokers,

19:00.240 --> 19:01.408
they're all going to jump.

19:01.441 --> 19:05.011
- It's $250,000.
It's not a lot of money.

19:05.011 --> 19:07.013
- That's $200,000
that we shouldn't even bother

19:07.013 --> 19:09.282
on trying to discuss.
- Just put the offer in.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.518
You don't know
what they're gonna say.

19:11.551 --> 19:14.320
- [sighs]

19:14.354 --> 19:16.723
Okay.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.292
- Get it done.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.194
- Even though I know
this is a mistake...

19:21.227 --> 19:22.195
I'll be back.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.596
<i>That's what the client wants.</i>

19:23.630 --> 19:27.834
I have to put on the face,
and I have to represent that.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.736
Peter.
- Luis.

19:29.769 --> 19:33.106
- [exhales deeply]

19:33.139 --> 19:34.674
All right,
so this is exciting.

19:34.708 --> 19:37.477
We can get
this apartment sold today.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.645
- Let's do it.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.881
- So we're going to give you
an offer of 13.5.

19:41.915 --> 19:44.050
<i>[tense music]</i>

19:44.050 --> 19:45.352
- Luis, you have to realize

19:45.385 --> 19:47.654
we have a list of over
1,000 names

19:47.687 --> 19:49.155
that want to get in the doors.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.724
We got you in first.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.092
- Yeah, I understand,
but most of those people

19:52.125 --> 19:53.326
that will come in

19:53.360 --> 19:55.862
will most likely not sign
a contract that same day.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.698
I think we've got a solid
client, extremely qualified.

19:58.732 --> 20:01.601
There is not a lot of $13
million buyers out there today.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.370
And it's, for him,
a principle thing

20:03.403 --> 20:05.271
to be able to negotiate
something of the asking.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.840
That's always how
he's done his business.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.742
- Luis, you're gonna offend
the developer.

20:08.775 --> 20:09.743
You're gonna offend
the sponsor.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.111
- Why?
- We got you in early.

20:11.144 --> 20:15.615
This is not the time and place
to be negotiating like that.

20:15.648 --> 20:16.883
- Listen,
I understand this product

20:16.916 --> 20:18.351
and understand what's happening.
- Right.

20:18.385 --> 20:21.121
- But the reality is,
it's what my clients want.

20:23.690 --> 20:27.761
- I do not think it has a chance
of going through.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.530
- Present the offer,
please.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.632
- Okay,
I'll present the offer.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.001
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Luis.

20:35.035 --> 20:37.303
- All right, call me tonight,
please, or as soon as you hear.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.506
- Absolutely.
- Thank you, Peter.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.840
If this deal doesn't go through,

20:40.874 --> 20:43.810
I'm worried Howard will think
it was a mistake

20:43.843 --> 20:45.812
giving me the chance
to be the first one in.

20:48.014 --> 20:51.451
<i>[upbeat dance music]</i>

20:51.484 --> 20:52.986
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:53.019 --> 20:56.289
The penthouse is more expensive
because it's also the largest.

20:56.322 --> 20:58.158
- I do have buyers.
- I know you have buyers.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.459
That's why I invited you.

20:59.492 --> 21:02.829
Yeah, so the private showing
is on Monday at 3:30.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.898
Oh, you already told him
you're not moving forward.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.466
- How many bedrooms?
- It's a four-bedroom,

21:06.499 --> 21:09.069
4 1/2 bath,
with two big terraces.

21:09.069 --> 21:10.804
Let's discuss that
at the private showing.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.506
Yeah,
we have the deal sheet ready.

21:13.540 --> 21:16.343
I just need
your return information.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.712
One last thing:
congratulations.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.480
Yes!
[grunts]

21:20.513 --> 21:22.782
I mean, the reason
why Manhattanites buy

21:22.816 --> 21:25.118
in Williamsburg
is they get more for the money.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.619
[gasps]

21:26.653 --> 21:28.321
<i>They're, like,</i>
<i>young professionals</i>

21:28.355 --> 21:30.123
buying at lower price points

21:30.156 --> 21:32.726
but getting the amazing views
of the Manhattan skyline.

21:32.759 --> 21:33.927

21:36.463 --> 21:39.432
[keys jingling]

21:39.466 --> 21:41.801
<i>This week has been so insane.</i>

21:41.835 --> 21:45.905
I've been coming home
at midnight every night.

21:45.939 --> 21:48.308
Hi, you sexy sh**.
- Hey, babe.

21:48.341 --> 21:50.710
- Sorry I'm coming home so late,
so much to do.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.948
- Why are you
in such a good mood?

21:54.981 --> 21:58.318
- I have only
one single unit left, one.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.486
That's right!

21:59.519 --> 22:02.655
I sold 17 out of the 18 units
in six days.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.057
Yay!

22:04.057 --> 22:06.059
Yes.

22:06.059 --> 22:07.260
Whee!

22:07.293 --> 22:10.063
Sold!
[laughs]

22:10.063 --> 22:12.632
I have one more unit.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.601
Feels so good to be so close.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.636
<i>That's the amazing thing</i>
<i>about new development.</i>

22:16.670 --> 22:18.672
I mean,
when you know how to surf,

22:18.705 --> 22:20.507
<i>you ride that wave,</i>

22:20.540 --> 22:23.076
and you can ride it all the way
to the golden shore.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.644
I thought
I was gonna lose everything,

22:24.678 --> 22:26.880
and now I just have one more.

22:26.913 --> 22:30.316
But enough about real estate.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.485
So...

22:32.519 --> 22:34.487
- So you're happy
with the decision you made?

22:37.824 --> 22:39.492
<i>Derek and I recently decided,</i>

22:39.526 --> 22:41.394
<i>despite the pain</i>
<i>that we had a miscarriage</i>

22:41.428 --> 22:42.729
that we're gonna try again.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.297
We're gonna do it.
We're gonna try again.

22:44.330 --> 22:47.634
<i>And we decided</i>
<i>to put in three embryos:</i>

22:47.667 --> 22:51.304
two girls,
one from me and one from Derek,

22:51.338 --> 22:54.341
and the third one is a boy,
from me.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.776
Less than 1% chance
that we get three.

22:56.810 --> 22:59.679
20-25% chance
that we get two, twins.

22:59.713 --> 23:02.382
70% chance that we get one.

23:02.415 --> 23:03.550
Let's see, let's see.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.652
Let the universe decide
what it's gonna be.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.287
- No worry that we're gonna
end up with three?

23:07.320 --> 23:09.055
- You're the one
that's worried.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.156
You're frightened.

23:10.190 --> 23:12.058
- It's 1% chance.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.894
- Can you image you, me,
three babies, and two dogs?

23:14.928 --> 23:17.263
I mean, I can't even grasp
what that would look like.

23:17.297 --> 23:18.264
Three.

23:18.298 --> 23:20.066
Three babies?

23:20.100 --> 23:21.434
Be careful what you ask for.

23:21.468 --> 23:25.338
Friday morning at 11:30 a.m.
is the transfer.

23:25.372 --> 23:27.207
- Yeah.
- Three embryos.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.676
- Whatever we have,
we are meant to have.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.478
[both smooching]

23:31.511 --> 23:32.479
- Time for sleep.

23:32.512 --> 23:33.980

23:34.080 --> 23:35.081
- What?

23:37.250 --> 23:39.619
- [laughs]

I don't want this.

Get this out of my face.

Now everybody has a baby.

Look who it is!

- Aww, Hudson.
- Hudson.

24:21.761 --> 24:25.799
- It's interesting.
Things are so different.

24:25.832 --> 24:29.169
I mean, I'm getting married,
and I'm gonna have kids.

24:29.202 --> 24:31.304
Emilia wants no less
than 12 children.

24:31.338 --> 24:33.073
- 12?
Has she had one?

24:33.073 --> 24:34.741
- Not yet.

We have North.

26:19.913 --> 26:23.917

you get a lot of it at once,

<i>and then it takes a few days</i>
<i>and you get nothing,</i>

26:39.466 --> 26:41.701

not to stress yourself out.

- Hi, how are you?
It's Fredrik.

26:47.407 --> 26:50.477

priced, around 1,250 a foot.

Beautiful two-bedroom, really
high ceilings, amazing light.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.082

a highway overpass to me.

26:58.718 --> 27:01.121
- You know,
I respectfully disagree

27:01.154 --> 27:03.623

is actually kind of a steal.

and they're moving along
with other people.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.730
- Roni, Peter called,
did he?

27:43.763 --> 27:45.265
- No.

27:45.298 --> 27:49.569
- [sighs]
Roni, Roni, I need it.

27:49.602 --> 27:50.570

27:58.578 --> 28:01.081
I'll call myself.
[line trilling]

28:01.114 --> 28:03.717
- Hey, Luis?
- Peter, any news?

28:15.528 --> 28:19.099
- I f***ing knew it.

28:19.132 --> 28:21.301
I knew it, but listen,

28:21.334 --> 28:24.704
now I just have to get Dennis
to come up to full ask.

28:24.738 --> 28:26.072
I understand that,

28:26.106 --> 28:29.075
and I appreciate you guys taking
me in before anybody else.

28:29.109 --> 28:31.111
Let me see what I can do.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.059
- What?

28:47.961 --> 28:50.063
- Wow.

28:50.063 --> 28:53.099
Everything that I did
to be the first person in there

28:53.133 --> 28:54.601
no longer matters

28:54.634 --> 28:56.302
because they're already
letting people in.

28:56.336 --> 28:58.772
My client didn't even want
to go on Schedule A.

28:58.805 --> 29:02.742
If I tell him that he has to
come up 5% percent in 24 hours,

29:02.776 --> 29:04.277
he's gonna walk away.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.015
- Peter, he is one of
those clients where--

29:14.320 --> 29:16.389
- I'll get back to you.

29:16.423 --> 29:19.025
- This is exactly what happens
when you try to negotiate

29:19.059 --> 29:21.261
in a building
that everybody in the world

29:21.294 --> 29:22.796
wants to be a part of.

29:22.829 --> 29:26.266
The price goes up $600,000
in less than 24 hours.

29:26.299 --> 29:29.235
Jesus.
F***.

29:29.269 --> 29:31.037
I have to get Ben up in price.

29:31.071 --> 29:33.740
Get me a meeting with Dennis.
I need to do this face-to-face.

29:44.184 --> 29:45.251

29:45.285 --> 29:48.588
But I'm hoping
that Ward might be.

29:48.621 --> 29:49.789
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>- Hey, Ryan.</i>

29:49.823 --> 29:51.091
How are you?
Good to see you.

29:51.124 --> 29:53.059
How are you doing?
- I am awesome.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.127
- That's good to hear.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.228
- So I have good news.

29:55.261 --> 29:56.830
- Okay.
Good news is always good.

29:56.863 --> 30:00.100
- I was able to get them
to finally make an offer.

30:00.133 --> 30:01.668
- Okay, great.

30:01.701 --> 30:03.236
- 15.5.

30:06.106 --> 30:08.575
- Seems really low, seems really
low, so we're definitely--

30:08.608 --> 30:10.844
- But it's an offer

30:10.877 --> 30:15.348
for a house that hasn't had
an offer in 3 1/2 years.

30:15.382 --> 30:16.750
- I wanted to list at 20.

30:16.783 --> 30:17.984
- I remember.
That was a good time.

30:18.018 --> 30:23.423
- And you were very certain
that 18 could get it done.

30:23.456 --> 30:27.193
- I'd list it at 18,
but 16 is the right number.

30:27.227 --> 30:28.395
- It's not what we want.

30:28.428 --> 30:29.662
- The internet
is everywhere now,

30:29.696 --> 30:30.764
and they are gonna know
that the house

30:30.797 --> 30:31.865
has been
on the market forever

30:31.898 --> 30:33.400
and they're just not
gonna come in

30:33.433 --> 30:35.301
at the asking price.

30:35.335 --> 30:37.370
I know I can get them up,
but we have to counter.

30:37.404 --> 30:38.805
- Well,
if we want to counter,

30:38.838 --> 30:40.507
I think we should counter
at 18.

30:40.540 --> 30:43.877
That's the number.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.445
- You want to counter
at the same asking price

30:45.478 --> 30:46.813
you've been at
for 3 1/2 years?

30:46.846 --> 30:48.748
Hmm...
Mm...mm.

30:48.782 --> 30:50.717
- We put a lot of effort
into this house.

30:50.750 --> 30:53.586
- I know I work for you,
right?

30:53.620 --> 30:55.055
But I also work
for the deal,

30:55.088 --> 30:56.956
and I know you do want
to sell this house.

30:56.990 --> 30:59.059
And that's just unrealistic.

30:59.092 --> 31:03.596
We need to counter,
or we're gonna lose them.

31:03.630 --> 31:06.399
- I mean, what...
[sighs]

31:06.433 --> 31:08.935
What if we counter at 17?

31:08.968 --> 31:10.270
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

31:10.303 --> 31:11.604
I'll be right back.

31:14.441 --> 31:15.775
- Hey, Sebastian.

31:15.809 --> 31:19.212
So the official counter
is 17.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.418
- Right,
no, I remember that.

31:25.452 --> 31:26.820
I know
we're not just accepting it,

31:26.853 --> 31:28.588
and maybe that's what happens
out in the West Coast,

31:28.621 --> 31:30.890
but in New York
we have negotiate a little bit,

31:30.924 --> 31:32.459
and it can be
a little bit annoying.

31:32.492 --> 31:33.660
So you just need
to get your guy up.

31:35.795 --> 31:37.664
- That's, like, the most
negative attitude ever.

31:37.697 --> 31:40.200
Don't--didn't you learn from me?
What the f***?

31:40.233 --> 31:41.201
Get him up.
You can get him up.

31:41.234 --> 31:42.402
Get him up. Get him up.
Get him up.

31:44.637 --> 31:48.208
- You know, I think I should do
more deals with my team

31:48.241 --> 31:50.110
because it gives me
the opportunity

31:50.110 --> 31:51.344
to critique their work.

31:51.378 --> 31:52.712
Kids, okay.

31:52.746 --> 31:57.183
Sebastian right now, he's kind
of like--like, at a B-.

31:57.217 --> 31:59.319
- Good news?
- I don't know yet.

31:59.352 --> 32:01.154
I don't know.

32:01.187 --> 32:02.188

32:11.831 --> 32:14.067
Um...

32:14.067 --> 32:15.835
This is not the counter
that I was hoping for.

32:15.869 --> 32:18.705
Ward is never,
ever gonna take this.

32:18.738 --> 32:20.740
This deal's dead.

32:22.609 --> 32:23.610
<i>Coming up...</i>

32:23.643 --> 32:25.111

5% over Schedule A.

32:26.913 --> 32:28.081

- Yes.

32:33.453 --> 32:33.920
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

32:36.156 --> 32:37.457

32:39.759 --> 32:42.796
I got a verbal
to come up to 16.

32:44.931 --> 32:46.566
- Oh, wow.

32:46.599 --> 32:48.535
- I'm f***ing pissed off,

32:48.568 --> 32:54.207
but I can't let Ward know that,
otherwise I will lose him.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.209
So we're...

32:56.242 --> 32:58.611
That's up
$1/2 million dollars!

32:58.645 --> 33:00.280
That's a lot.

33:00.313 --> 33:04.084
- We're still, oh, man,
a million difference right now.

33:04.117 --> 33:07.253
- Yeah, the house has been on
the market for a very long time.

33:07.287 --> 33:09.456
- You keep reminding me how long
it's been on the market,

33:09.489 --> 33:11.658
and, you know, to me,

33:11.691 --> 33:15.195
what I'm hearing right now
are a lot of excuses.

33:15.228 --> 33:17.364
- This is the one person we've
been able to get in the door

33:17.397 --> 33:19.332
to actually make an offer,
so we need to come down.

33:19.366 --> 33:22.268
We need to come down.
We need to be aggressive.

33:22.302 --> 33:25.438
We need to go back to them
with 16.5.

33:25.472 --> 33:26.873
Pull on your big-boy pants,

33:26.906 --> 33:27.874
and we got to just sell
this f***ing house.

33:27.907 --> 33:29.075
- I get it, I get it.

33:29.075 --> 33:31.611
You know, look,
I'm a real estate developer.

33:31.644 --> 33:38.084
Let's go back at 16.5, final,
final offer, no lower, no lower.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.819
- I'll be right back.

33:39.853 --> 33:44.257
16.5, okay, so we are,
like, basically there.

33:46.092 --> 33:47.727
- You have no idea
the type of person

33:47.761 --> 33:49.129
I'm dealing with right now.

33:49.162 --> 33:53.233
My team reached out to thousands
of people from other cities,

33:53.266 --> 33:56.403
and we've got one person--
one.

33:57.470 --> 33:59.205
<i>- If he walks out,</i>

33:59.239 --> 34:02.042
I'm gonna have to open an office
in, like, Mongolia

34:03.643 --> 34:07.180

- Good news?

34:07.213 --> 34:09.315
- Um, they're gonna do 16 1/4.

34:09.349 --> 34:12.218
Now we're $250,000 apart.

34:12.252 --> 34:14.087
- I mean,
it's a little insulting.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.089
I got to stand for something,
and, like,

34:16.122 --> 34:17.190
this is out of principle.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.225
We're not doing that.
- Principle.

34:19.259 --> 34:21.227
If we don't take this,

34:21.261 --> 34:23.063
we're gonna be here
in two years

34:23.096 --> 34:27.300
talking about $15 million
or $14 million.

34:27.334 --> 34:29.469
Right? Or we're gonna talk
about renting it.

34:29.502 --> 34:30.503
- [groans]

34:36.376 --> 34:38.945
We'll do 16 1/4.
Let's do it.

34:38.978 --> 34:40.080
Let's wrap it up.

34:40.113 --> 34:42.449

34:42.482 --> 34:44.184
Yes!
Oh!

Oh, man...
yes.

There you go,
look at those teeth.

34:50.590 --> 34:52.559
- I'm happy, come on.
- Look at those teeth.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.461
Ward actually seems to be
in a good mood.

34:54.494 --> 34:57.731
Maybe he'll actually pay
for the inspection cost for me.

34:57.764 --> 34:58.865
And the punch list.

34:58.898 --> 35:01.134
- No, I'm not doing that.
You want to do it?

35:01.167 --> 35:03.136
Go for it, but I'm not doing
the punch list.

35:20.053 --> 35:21.588

I can see

35:21.621 --> 35:23.823
in the eyes when the buyer
wants an apartment.

35:23.857 --> 35:25.959
I've been doing this
long enough.

35:26.059 --> 35:27.794
- This is a fabulous apartment.

35:27.827 --> 35:29.696
- Everybody knows that you want
that apartment, the penthouse.

35:29.729 --> 35:31.698
- They like it.
- So where's the offer?

35:31.731 --> 35:33.199
That's why
I'm meeting you here.

35:33.233 --> 35:35.869
- Listen, they're also looking
at places along the water.

35:35.902 --> 35:37.303
- You don't need to look
at anything else,

35:37.337 --> 35:38.571
because I know
that this is the best.

35:38.605 --> 35:40.473
It's a conversion
with those high ceilings.

35:40.507 --> 35:41.474
Where else
are you gonna find that?

35:41.508 --> 35:42.809
- I got to talk to them.

35:42.842 --> 35:43.943
You know I can't force anybody
to do anything.

35:43.977 --> 35:45.879
- It's so gorgeous,
and you have the bridge;

35:45.912 --> 35:47.480
you have the water;
you have everything.

35:47.514 --> 35:49.716
- I will let you know
as soon as I hear back.

35:49.749 --> 35:51.785
- I'm one unit away
to complete the challenge,

35:51.818 --> 35:53.720
but that's not enough
for Mona.

35:53.753 --> 35:56.089
It's all or nothing,
and trust me,

35:56.089 --> 35:58.692
I'm not the kind of guy who
wants to be left with nothing.

35:58.725 --> 36:01.227

One more.

- So why don't we do this?

36:15.108 --> 36:16.710
Look at the email,
I'll send it out to you,

36:16.743 --> 36:18.945

all right?

Take care.

What's up, brother?
You got some good news for me?

36:22.649 --> 36:26.186
Give me some good news, baby.
- I do not, man.

36:26.219 --> 36:27.620
They're not going
to accept our offer,

36:27.654 --> 36:29.956
and they're not going to accept
Schedule A anymore.

36:30.056 --> 36:30.957
- Why?

36:31.057 --> 36:32.759
- Because since we were there,

36:32.792 --> 36:34.494
they have sent
three contracts out.

36:34.527 --> 36:36.429
- Weren't you--
aren't you the first guy in?

36:36.463 --> 36:38.064
- I was,
but now they're allowing

36:38.064 --> 36:39.332
some brokers to start coming in.

36:39.366 --> 36:41.067
Listen, this is a building that
was very hot, I told you.

36:41.101 --> 36:42.936
- I mean, Luis, I told him
we were getting a deal.

36:42.969 --> 36:45.538
Now you're telling me we can't
even get Schedule A pricing?

36:45.572 --> 36:47.073
- If we want the apartment,

36:47.073 --> 36:48.842
we have to pay 5%
over Schedule A.

36:48.875 --> 36:49.943
- What?
- Yes.

36:49.976 --> 36:52.078
- Not happening.
It's not happening.

36:52.078 --> 36:53.079
We'll just sit back and wait.

36:53.079 --> 36:54.147
- There's no waiting.

36:54.180 --> 36:56.483
Even 5% now
is still a good number.

36:56.516 --> 36:59.085
This comes from every single
inch of experience

36:59.085 --> 37:00.286
I have in this business.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.256
Buildings like this come up
once every ten years.

37:03.289 --> 37:04.391
- Stop.
Stop the sales, this is--

This is the--this is the truth.

37:07.560 --> 37:11.364
It's either that or lose
a great, great apartment,

37:11.398 --> 37:13.400
and maybe tomorrow it's 10%

37:19.305 --> 37:22.042
- I'll call him.
I mean, let's see what happens.

37:22.042 --> 37:23.209
- There have been developments

37:23.243 --> 37:27.280
that offering plans have been
amended 20, 25 times.

37:27.313 --> 37:29.749
- And now they want
to boost us up to 5%.

37:29.783 --> 37:32.218
<i>- 5%,</i>
<i>this is still a good deal,</i>

37:32.252 --> 37:34.754

37:34.788 --> 37:36.790
- No.

37:36.823 --> 37:38.324
I understand that.

37:38.358 --> 37:39.926
He was the first one in.

37:39.959 --> 37:42.629
I mean, look, here's--

37:42.662 --> 37:44.197
<i>I need to be on</i>
<i>that phone call</i>

37:44.230 --> 37:45.732
<i>because I need to make sure</i>

37:45.765 --> 37:50.370
that he tells him exactly
what needs to be told.

37:50.403 --> 37:53.506
- And he kid's great
at what he does.

37:53.540 --> 37:55.108
I do.

37:55.141 --> 37:57.877
Okay.

37:57.911 --> 38:02.615
All right, so he's prepared
to go up to Schedule A pricing,

38:02.649 --> 38:05.719
nothing more than that.

38:05.752 --> 38:08.621
- Listen, man,
I cannot go back to Schedule A.

38:08.655 --> 38:10.390
I even tried--even if we wanted
to go Schedule A,

38:10.423 --> 38:11.391
they're not gonna do that.

38:11.424 --> 38:12.492
- Luis, you can do this.

38:12.525 --> 38:14.728
Make it happen.

38:14.761 --> 38:16.930
- This is so f***ed.

to Howard Lorber,

38:23.136 --> 38:24.304

38:24.337 --> 38:27.941

so much for me.

38:28.041 --> 38:29.142
I have no choice.

38:29.175 --> 38:30.243

doing here?

- Yeah.
- Okay.

41:16.076 --> 41:21.081
- You know how you got me into
the building, and...

41:21.114 --> 41:23.083
listen, the problem
is that the buyer

41:23.083 --> 41:25.085
did not want to pay full ask.

41:25.118 --> 41:27.320
And I explained to him that,

41:27.354 --> 41:28.855
you know, it's not a building
that will negotiate.

41:28.888 --> 41:30.490
- Did you really tell him?
- I did tell him,

41:30.523 --> 41:32.859
but he was stubborn and he was
still wanting me to negotiate,

41:32.892 --> 41:34.494
and he pushed me
and he pushed me.

41:34.527 --> 41:36.096

that they won't even take

41:36.096 --> 41:39.499
the Schedule A pricing
that now my buyer wants.

41:39.532 --> 41:40.667
They will only accept--

41:40.700 --> 41:43.336
- Yeah, because they have
a lot of pent-up demand

41:43.370 --> 41:45.171

to start.

41:45.205 --> 41:47.340
I get it, you want to raise
those prices.

41:47.374 --> 41:49.642
- But I think if there is a
chance for us to get Schedule A,

41:49.676 --> 41:51.444
I'd like explore it and then
I'd like to push for it.

41:51.478 --> 41:52.779

is you're not doing

41:52.812 --> 41:56.349
the right job for, you know,
for the client.

41:56.383 --> 42:00.120
