- We have Brian on a car phone.

She's sincere and charming

I was afraid with all that sucking up,
you might have burst a lung.

01:21.223 --> 01:22.253
That is very funny, Roz.

01:22.432 --> 01:26.012
You see, Kelly's looking for a new
co-host for the parade this year.

01:26.183 --> 01:28.091
I was hoping it might be me.

01:28.267 --> 01:30.305
I've watched that parade
since I was a child

and this is my chance
to become a part of it.

- She did that with her husband.
- I guess you haven't heard.

See, she's discovered that Cal's been
having an affair with her cue-card girl.

She and I briefly co-hosted
my show last year.

Of course I remember.

of Seattle radio listeners

Well, Mary, I hate to quibble about
things like accreditation and such...

Yes, congratulations indeed.
I must have missed that memo.

took an oath not to hurt anybody.

- We won't be sharing a mike, will we?
- Of course not.

03:02.004 --> 03:03.663
We're giving Mary
the morning-drive shift.

I hid it in the vegetable crisper.
I knew you'd never look there.

11:40.123 --> 11:43.703
Oh, Niles, they're exquisite.
Thank you.

11:43.874 --> 11:44.952
You're welcome.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.751
Batteries! Thank you.

11:54.919 --> 11:58.286
You opened the wrong package.
You were supposed to open this one.

11:58.462 --> 12:00.583
Oh, no, no, I can't open another one.
That's not fair.

12:00.754 --> 12:03.041
Well, you know,
if we all open one more,

12:03.213 --> 12:05.454
that would make it even.

12:07.256 --> 12:09.247
- Sounds fair.
- All right, but that's it.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.628
- Yes, no more.
- Yeah.

[MARCHING BAND PLAYING]

12:19.177 --> 12:22.211
Merry Christmas, Seattle.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane...

12:22.386 --> 12:25.053
And Dr. Mary.

12:25.220 --> 12:29.085
- Welcoming you to the 42nd
annual Seattle Christmas parade.

12:29.263 --> 12:33.175
Yes. First off, we wanna wish
Kelly Kirkland a speedy recovery.

12:33.348 --> 12:36.263
Indeed. And may I say,
it's an honour to be sitting here

12:36.432 --> 12:38.968
in the very chairs
that were once occupied

12:39.141 --> 12:42.673
by the legendary Bob Vernon
and his co-host Sergeant Michelle,

12:42.851 --> 12:45.636
that started this tradition
so many years ago.

12:45.810 --> 12:50.469
And here comes our first float,
Frosty the Snowman.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.804
You know, Mary,
historically speaking,

12:52.979 --> 12:56.511
the first float was probably
the Trojan horse,

12:56.688 --> 12:59.178
which was a gift
to the people of Troy.

12:59.356 --> 13:01.098
Once brought inside the city walls,
however,

13:01.273 --> 13:03.762
they discovered it was filled
with Greek soldiers

13:03.940 --> 13:06.726
who slaughtered their Trojan enemies
in the street.

13:06.900 --> 13:10.562
Of course, modern floats
have come a long way since then.

13:10.734 --> 13:11.931
We hope.

13:14.069 --> 13:15.941
Well, this float comes to us as a gift

13:16.111 --> 13:19.560
from Seattle's sister city,
Managua, Nicaragua.

13:19.737 --> 13:21.527
Well, you know,
I like the way that sounds.

13:21.696 --> 13:23.522
Managua, Nicaragua.

13:23.697 --> 13:26.399
Sounds like the name
of a fine Latino man.

13:26.572 --> 13:30.816
Would you like to dance, Dr. Mary?
Yes, I would, Managua Nicaragua.

13:30.990 --> 13:34.571
Shake that cute
little Costa Rica for me.

13:34.742 --> 13:38.025
For more information,
here's float reporter Mike.

13:38.201 --> 13:39.659
And we're clear.

13:39.827 --> 13:42.660
- This is fun. Isn't this fun?
- Yes, but you know, Mary,

13:42.827 --> 13:45.696
maybe we should try
sticking to the script.

13:45.870 --> 13:48.027
The more we improvise,
the less professional we look.

13:48.204 --> 13:49.318
Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.902
Hey, Mary, great ad libbing.
More of that.

13:52.080 --> 13:56.739
Frasier, try to loosen up.
We're back in five, four, three...

13:56.915 --> 14:01.989
<i>As you can see, Mary, this enormous</i>
<i>stocking is overstuffed with presents.</i>

14:02.167 --> 14:04.834
<i>I'd like to tear into one of those gifts</i>
<i>right now.</i>

14:05.001 --> 14:06.992
<i>FRASIER: Well, not until</i>
<i>Christmas morning, Mary.</i>

14:07.168 --> 14:11.246
<i>You know, in my house,</i>
<i>we don't even shake the boxes.</i>

14:17.838 --> 14:19.415
We're going to need
some wrapping paper.

14:19.589 --> 14:22.671
- There's a couple of rolls in my room.
- I'll get the tape.

14:22.840 --> 14:27.380
And this is the fifth float sponsored
by a local software company.

14:27.550 --> 14:30.584
Hey, those guys on that giant laptop
are throwing candy canes.

14:30.759 --> 14:33.083
Yes, Mary,
at a hundred and fifty feet,

14:33.260 --> 14:36.093
it certainly is the largest float
in the parade.

14:36.261 --> 14:38.252
Hey, throw some
of those candy canes over here.

14:38.428 --> 14:40.917
Come on, come on,
put some muscle into it, you nerds.

14:41.096 --> 14:43.170
Now, Mary,
let's not disparage the good...

14:43.346 --> 14:44.460
MARY:
Ow! Oh.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.552
Thanks. Thank you.

14:46.722 --> 14:48.797
This might be a good time
for a break.

14:48.973 --> 14:50.929
But we have an exciting surprise
coming up,

14:51.099 --> 14:52.805

- But we're outside.

15:09.646 --> 15:11.637

Hey, Frasier, thanks for the tickets.
Alice is having a great time.

15:18.107 --> 15:21.271
Well, I'm glad somebody is.
Mary is ruining my parade.

15:21.441 --> 15:23.812
Do you know this has been called
nice banter

15:23.984 --> 15:26.651
by a top parade professional?
Does anybody get to hear it? No.

15:26.818 --> 15:28.276
Instead,
Mary prattles on endlessly

15:28.444 --> 15:30.565
as if every idea in her head
is worth saying out loud.

15:30.736 --> 15:32.395
She is totally unpredictable.

15:32.570 --> 15:34.857
Now, Santa's coming up
and I prepared a really cute bit

15:35.029 --> 15:36.522
and I know
she's gonna ruin that too.

15:36.696 --> 15:39.481
Look, if you tell her how important it is,
I'm sure she'll back off.

15:39.655 --> 15:42.571
- She's a reasonable person.

- Good luck.
- Thanks.

over the parade this evening.

Well, hello, young man.

he's affectionately known...

You know,
I've been meaning to call your show.

My elves always seem to get
a little blue when the work is done

16:15.625 --> 16:17.533
and, well,
I thought maybe you could help.

16:17.709 --> 16:19.534
Oh, Santa.

16:19.709 --> 16:21.665
Santa, I've got some questions
over here for you.

16:21.835 --> 16:24.075
Well, let's all see
if we can put our heads together

16:24.252 --> 16:26.291
and come up with a solution.

16:26.461 --> 16:30.503
Kids, do you think that Dr. Mary
can help Santa to cheer up his elves?

16:30.671 --> 16:33.125
CROWD:
Yes!

16:33.297 --> 16:35.418
Well, why don't you give them
some candy?

16:35.589 --> 16:39.667
- Oh, now, that's a great idea.
- No, that's a terrible idea.

16:39.841 --> 16:42.544
Your elves are probably suffering
from seasonal affective disorder.

16:42.717 --> 16:45.799
Now, loading them up with sweets
will only aggravate the problem.

16:45.968 --> 16:49.915
But Mary's right. Kids love candy.

16:50.094 --> 16:52.500
Elves are not kids. They're tiny men.

16:54.262 --> 16:57.012
- Well, if you want my opinion...
FRASIER: No, thank you, Mary.

16:57.179 --> 16:58.210
We've been listening,

16:58.388 --> 17:00.794
and frankly, there isn't room
left in our heads for another.

Now, if you would just
get back to the dais...

- What the hell's wrong with you?

- Look, I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding.
- It was an accident.

- I'm dizzy.
FRASIER: Here. Sit down.

Cut to tape. I don't care what tape.
Find something.

What's wrong with you?
You attacked Santa Claus.

Well, it was an accident,
wasn't it, Mary? You saw it.

Oh, now you want my opinion.
Honey, you're on your own.

- Hello, Mary.
- Hello.

I'd like to apologise
for the way I acted toward you.

17:42.735 --> 17:45.769
It was rude and disrespectful.

17:45.944 --> 17:48.268
Well, what did I do
to make you treat me that way?

17:49.529 --> 17:52.812
Well, it's just that doing this parade
has been a dream of mine,

17:52.988 --> 17:56.402
and it felt like
you were taking that away from me.

17:56.573 --> 17:59.572
- What do you mean? We were a team.
- Oh, yeah.

17:59.740 --> 18:02.692
I was the boring stiff guy
and you were the one everybody loved.

- Oh, come on, now.
- No, it's true, Mary.

18:05.826 --> 18:10.235
This town has taken you into its heart
in a way that they never have with me.

18:10.410 --> 18:12.318
I guess I'm a little jealous of that.

18:12.661 --> 18:15.115
Oh, Frasier, if it helps, I forgive you.

18:15.954 --> 18:19.616
You know, when you're not trying so
hard, you're kind of loveable yourself.

18:19.788 --> 18:20.985
Really?

18:22.998 --> 18:25.950
Would I be overstepping my bounds

if I were to ask
for some sugar right now?

- Thank you.

Say, you didn't watch the parade
this evening, did you?

19:23.475 --> 19:25.181
I turned it off
when the smelling salts

19:25.350 --> 19:28.515
started making Santa nauseous.

19:30.268 --> 19:32.260
You know, Frasier,

19:32.436 --> 19:37.094
I got off to a rather rough start
in this parade myself.

- You did?
- Mm. Oh, yes.

19:39.688 --> 19:43.683
Now, Sergeant Michelle and I had
absolutely no rapport that first year.

19:43.856 --> 19:47.057
- No.
- Well, frankly, she got on my nerves.

You know,
she wasn't a real sergeant.

No.

Listen, son,
try to lighten up on yourself.

out there today.

- Good luck.

- Yeah?

march in perfect rhythm?
