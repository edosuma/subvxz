WEBVTT

02:54.824 --> 02:56.892
Hey, hurry up.
Let's go.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.263
All right, boys,
all I need is one guy.

03:02.168 --> 03:03.968
You!

03:04.037 --> 03:05.671
You're big enough.
What's your name?

03:05.739 --> 03:07.139
Dombrowsky, Sir.

03:07.209 --> 03:08.241
Huh?

03:08.310 --> 03:09.910
Dombrowsky, Sir.
I'm Polish.

03:11.682 --> 03:16.285
Polish! All right,
get in there, Polack.

03:19.359 --> 03:21.426
Sorry, boys,
that's enough.

03:23.564 --> 03:24.531
One more.

03:25.033 --> 03:25.932
Come on.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.801
My name is Mr. Gant.

03:29.473 --> 03:31.673
Payday is every Friday.

03:33.077 --> 03:35.212
All right, now,

03:35.281 --> 03:37.582
You stay here as long as
I want you to.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.351
If the, uh, delivery
don't get here

03:39.419 --> 03:41.721
until 10:00 at night,
you stay till 10:00,

03:41.789 --> 03:44.458
but you only get
paid 8 hours, period.

03:44.527 --> 03:46.294
If you get sick,
that's too bad.

03:46.363 --> 03:47.329
Do you understand?

03:47.398 --> 03:48.564
Yes, Sir, Mr. Gant.

03:48.633 --> 03:50.700
And if you drop
any of the stuff,

03:50.769 --> 03:53.504
If you ruin the merchandise,
that's out of your pay.

03:53.573 --> 03:55.340
It's company policy.

03:55.409 --> 03:56.675
Yes, Sir.

04:05.590 --> 04:07.824
All right, boys, we've got
a lot stuff coming in.

04:07.893 --> 04:09.526
Roll it out!

04:09.595 --> 04:12.931
Kovak, I want you
to put Mr. Dombrowsky here to work.

04:14.001 --> 04:15.802
Hey, Kovak,

04:15.870 --> 04:17.672
that don't
belong to you.

04:22.713 --> 04:24.747
We get in there
at 5:00,

04:24.816 --> 04:27.017
get out at 7:00,

04:27.085 --> 04:29.086
end up
working 14 hours.

04:29.155 --> 04:31.957
Work 14 and you
get paid for 8.

04:32.026 --> 04:33.427
It's a living.

04:33.929 --> 04:34.894
It's crap.

04:36.165 --> 04:37.865
It's a crap life,
that's what it is.

04:37.934 --> 04:40.001
It's a job,
Johnny.

04:40.070 --> 04:41.771
To you it's a job.
To me it's crap.

04:43.275 --> 04:45.576
I've been
working hard all day,

04:45.645 --> 04:48.948
and I don't need to be hangin' around
with no sour bohunk.

04:59.998 --> 05:01.632
And they got this buzzer, ma.

05:01.701 --> 05:02.700
Buzzer?

05:02.769 --> 05:04.503
Buzzer, buzzer, buzzer,
bzz, buzzer.

05:04.572 --> 05:05.604
They got this buzzer.

05:15.353 --> 05:16.887
Someday I wanna
tear that buzzer out

05:16.955 --> 05:18.522
by the roots
and give it to you.

05:18.591 --> 05:20.258
Don't break nothing!

05:20.326 --> 05:21.861
They pay you the money.

05:23.297 --> 05:25.365
We're gonna buy mansions
up in the heights, right, Abe?

05:25.434 --> 05:26.467
Big heights.

05:26.536 --> 05:28.269
Come on,
all the companies got buzzers.

05:28.337 --> 05:29.738
You're a lot of help.

05:29.807 --> 05:30.739
Don't start trouble,
Johnny.

05:30.808 --> 05:32.141
Give it to him, ma.

05:32.210 --> 05:34.545
Always some trouble.
Your friends never complain.

05:34.614 --> 05:36.447
That's right.
He never complains.

05:36.516 --> 05:38.316
What's the matter with you?

05:38.385 --> 05:39.952
Your pa,

05:40.021 --> 05:41.621
he never complained.

05:45.228 --> 05:47.396
Oh, kiss my buzzer,
will you?

05:56.911 --> 05:59.613
Dombrowsky, you havin' trouble
with your back?

05:59.682 --> 06:00.848
No, Sir, Mr. Gant.

06:00.917 --> 06:02.283
Then take more
of those crates.

06:02.352 --> 06:04.619
Kovak, load him up.

06:04.688 --> 06:05.988
Come on. Come on.

06:06.057 --> 06:08.158
He can take more than that.
More.

06:08.226 --> 06:09.894
All right,
now keep moving.

06:09.963 --> 06:11.896
We haven't got all day.

06:24.115 --> 06:27.050
That's 4 crates of tomatoes
out of your pocket, Polack.

06:27.119 --> 06:29.187
- The company says...
- But you made me put 'em there, Sir.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.723
You break 'em,
you pay for 'em.

06:30.792 --> 06:32.558
That's company policy.

06:32.627 --> 06:34.260
Did you hear me?

06:35.465 --> 06:36.531
I heard you, Sir.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.732
All right.

06:37.801 --> 06:40.035
Get down there
and pick 'em up, boy.

06:40.104 --> 06:42.438
And hurry it up.
We're runnin' late.

06:48.182 --> 06:49.215
Come on,
we'll get 'em up.

06:49.283 --> 06:50.651
Belkin!
Put the good ones in here.

06:50.720 --> 06:51.819
Get back
to work.

06:51.888 --> 06:53.955
Put the bad ones
in here.

06:54.024 --> 06:55.992
That's bad.
Bad.

06:56.060 --> 06:57.593
What do you guys think
you're doin'?

06:57.662 --> 06:59.796
Get back to work!
All of you!

07:00.867 --> 07:02.400
Samuels.

07:02.468 --> 07:03.502
Didn't you hear me?

07:03.571 --> 07:04.603
Samuels.

07:04.672 --> 07:06.673
Samuels, you're fired!

07:08.811 --> 07:10.244
Get your voucher,
you're through.

07:10.312 --> 07:11.680
I...I didn't hear you,
Mr. Gant.

07:11.749 --> 07:14.116
Get out! Get out!
You're fired!

07:14.185 --> 07:15.518
Johnny.

07:15.587 --> 07:17.054
Tell him, Johnny,

07:17.122 --> 07:19.257
I didn't hear him.
I didn't.

07:33.045 --> 07:35.079
Don't you think you'd better
get this fish inside

07:35.147 --> 07:36.146
before it spoils?

07:36.215 --> 07:37.215
What's it to you,
Mac?

07:37.284 --> 07:39.719
The name's Monahan,
Mike Monahan.

07:39.788 --> 07:41.320
Why don't you mind
your own business?

07:41.389 --> 07:42.456
It is my business.

07:42.524 --> 07:45.193
It's gonna spoil
if you don't get it inside.

07:45.261 --> 07:46.862
What do we care?

07:46.931 --> 07:48.397
I want
the wagon unloaded.

07:48.466 --> 07:50.500
Why don't you come up here
and do it yourself?

07:50.569 --> 07:52.236
Well, I'm the driver.
Hey!

07:52.305 --> 07:53.972
Well, it's not
my job either.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.908
What are you guys
trying to pull?

07:55.977 --> 07:58.311
You know where that stuff goes.
Get it inside!

07:58.379 --> 07:59.947
We don't need
any lazy bastards

08:00.016 --> 08:01.782
around here,
you hear me, Belkin?

08:01.851 --> 08:03.451
And you too, Kovak.
You're another...

08:03.520 --> 08:05.888
you call me a bastard,
I'll lay you out.

08:09.997 --> 08:11.362
Eh.

08:11.431 --> 08:15.002
Well, I guess a job don't mean nothin'
to a rich man like you.

08:20.277 --> 08:22.979
That's out of your pay,
Kovak.

08:23.048 --> 08:24.814
What the hell do you think
you're doin'?

08:24.884 --> 08:26.150
I wanna see
boss Andrews.

08:26.218 --> 08:28.186
I'll give you Andrews.
You're fired, Kovak!

08:28.255 --> 08:29.487
You get the hell out of here!

08:36.166 --> 08:37.732
Go get Andrews!

08:49.517 --> 08:51.786
Andrews! Andrews!

08:51.854 --> 08:54.455
Andrews! Andrews! Andrews!

08:54.524 --> 08:56.793
I'm glad
you told me about this.

08:56.861 --> 08:59.763
You've got
some legitimate complaints.

08:59.832 --> 09:01.332
Let's agree on this.

09:01.401 --> 09:03.135
From now on,

09:03.204 --> 09:05.470
Gant here can't fire anyone
without my approval.

09:05.539 --> 09:08.743
How's that?

09:08.812 --> 09:11.847
Well, how about havin' to pay for something
you dropped by accident?

09:11.916 --> 09:14.483
From now on, anything
that's accidentally damaged,

09:14.552 --> 09:16.420
you don't have to pay for.

09:16.488 --> 09:17.855
What about overtime?

09:17.924 --> 09:20.025
Being paid
waiting for deliveries?

09:20.094 --> 09:22.228
I won't lie to you.
That's out of my hands.

09:22.296 --> 09:24.497
I'll have to talk
to my superiors.

09:24.566 --> 09:25.933
All right?

09:27.604 --> 09:29.772
We'll try to be fair.

09:29.841 --> 09:32.242
But to be fair all around,

09:32.310 --> 09:33.643
you fellows
will go back to work

09:33.713 --> 09:35.346
and move that load inside,
right away.

09:35.414 --> 09:37.582
Wait, wait, how...how do we know
you're gonna talk to 'em

09:37.651 --> 09:39.452
about the extra pay?
How do we know that?

09:39.520 --> 09:41.187
You have my word.

09:43.025 --> 09:45.160
By the way, Mr. Kovak,
I'd like to praise you

09:45.229 --> 09:48.130
for bringing this matter
to my attention.

09:48.199 --> 09:50.433
The problems
will be corrected.

09:52.638 --> 09:54.340
Do we have a deal?

09:58.580 --> 10:01.648
The idea is not to go
back to work until the...

10:03.053 --> 10:04.453
I'll go along
with Johnny.

10:04.522 --> 10:05.588
Ok.

10:11.966 --> 10:14.634
All right,
we got a deal.

10:17.107 --> 10:18.873
Here's to Johnny Kovak!

10:18.942 --> 10:20.475
No, no.
Lincoln Dombrowsky!

10:20.544 --> 10:22.645
Abe Lincoln!

10:25.584 --> 10:27.552
How about
another round?

10:27.621 --> 10:29.354
Looky there,
here's a new face.

10:29.423 --> 10:31.090
What's your name?
Another round?

10:31.159 --> 10:32.359
Another round.

10:32.428 --> 10:34.628
Put it around, Johnny.
Put it around,

10:34.696 --> 10:36.331
Yeah,
you break it,

10:36.400 --> 10:38.634
you pay for it.

10:38.702 --> 10:40.804
Look at those rosy cheeks.
Are you Irish?

10:40.872 --> 10:42.406
What of it?
What of it?

10:42.474 --> 10:44.208
Why don't you take
your hands off of me,

10:44.277 --> 10:46.611
and be a gentleman
like your friend here?

10:46.680 --> 10:47.948
Oh!

10:48.016 --> 10:49.449
Gentleman,
are my hands no good?

10:49.517 --> 10:50.651
You're a gentleman?

10:50.719 --> 10:52.253
Hey, Johnny!
You come on now,

10:52.322 --> 10:53.355
we wrestle.

10:53.424 --> 10:54.756
Come on, for a nickel.

10:54.825 --> 10:57.327
Well I'll tell you, Jugs,
it's been kind of a hard day,

10:57.395 --> 10:59.029
but Abe is feeling good.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.799
you wanna wrestle
Jugovich?

11:01.868 --> 11:03.702
Come on, come on. Come on.
Come on.

11:04.439 --> 11:06.273
Come on, Abe.

11:06.342 --> 11:08.509
Ok. All right.
Put it down here.

11:08.578 --> 11:10.244
Come on,
put the nickel down.

11:12.283 --> 11:13.416
Who's on me?

11:14.752 --> 11:15.786
- Come on.
- Go on.

11:15.855 --> 11:17.421
I don't wanna
hurt you, Jugs.

11:17.490 --> 11:19.191
I think you need a little bit more
arm there, Abe.

11:19.259 --> 11:20.492
Get it down there.

11:20.560 --> 11:21.694
All right.
Zigi, you ready.

11:21.762 --> 11:23.797
Ok, fellows.
Are you ready?

11:23.866 --> 11:24.898
Start it, Zig.

11:24.967 --> 11:26.234
Go!

11:42.892 --> 11:45.460
Look who is here:
Vince Doyle!

11:45.529 --> 11:48.398
And look at that
big-shot suit he's got on.

11:48.466 --> 11:49.766
Mm-mm-mmm.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.569
You slumming,
Vince?

11:51.638 --> 11:53.138
No, I just got
a little business

11:53.206 --> 11:54.706
to talk over
with Zigi here.

11:54.775 --> 11:56.208
Hey, Vince, you hear about us
at the company?

11:56.277 --> 11:58.311
Listen, Vince,
Johnny had their backs to the wall.

11:58.380 --> 11:59.680
We almost had
a walkout.

12:01.151 --> 12:02.684
We won, Vince.

12:02.753 --> 12:04.620
What did you win, kid?

12:05.557 --> 12:07.491
Zigi, set these guys up.

12:16.272 --> 12:18.139
Anything wrong,
Johnny?

12:19.410 --> 12:20.809
The buzzer?

12:21.812 --> 12:23.080
The buzzer.

12:28.989 --> 12:30.523
- Come on!
- Where's Johnny?

12:31.726 --> 12:33.660
Hey, Johnny!

12:33.729 --> 12:35.797
They won't
let us in, John.

12:36.700 --> 12:39.970
Number 7, number 8,
number 9.

12:40.038 --> 12:41.205
What's goin' on
here?

12:41.273 --> 12:42.773
What are you
doing here?

12:42.842 --> 12:44.309
Hey Samuels,
where you going?

12:44.377 --> 12:45.677
I gotta work,
Johnny.

12:45.746 --> 12:47.113
Hey, I wanna get...
I wanna see Andrews.

12:47.114 --> 12:47.583
Well, well, well,

12:47.584 --> 12:50.552
Mr. Kovak wants to see Mr. Andrews.
That's right, Gant.

12:50.621 --> 12:53.423
Well, Mr. Kovak,
Mr. Andrews is out of town.

12:53.492 --> 12:55.726
But he left
a little message for you.

12:55.794 --> 12:57.429
You're fired!
All of you!

12:57.498 --> 12:58.563
Fired?

13:32.280 --> 13:34.046
The winner.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.782
Who asked you, Vince?

13:35.850 --> 13:38.719
So you gotta go out
and try to save the world, huh, kid?

13:38.788 --> 13:41.523
You know, it cost me
$20 to get you out.

13:42.427 --> 13:44.394
He said
we had a deal.

13:44.462 --> 13:46.630
A deal? Christ, Johnny.

13:46.699 --> 13:49.201
You don't go screwin' around
with those people.

13:49.269 --> 13:50.903
You got no push.

13:53.242 --> 13:55.008
He shook my hand,
Vince.

13:55.077 --> 13:57.478
He shook my hand,
he said we had a deal.

13:57.547 --> 13:58.914
Yeah, sure.

14:00.218 --> 14:02.785
Listen, kid, why don't
you come to work for me?

14:02.855 --> 14:05.757
We'll make an honest buck
together, hmm?

14:05.826 --> 14:07.759
Always lookin' out for me,
ain't you, Vince?

14:07.828 --> 14:09.696
What's the matter,
you need another stooge?

14:09.764 --> 14:12.132
Johnny, rest it,
will you? Relax.

14:15.740 --> 14:18.006
You don't
understand this, Vince.

14:19.478 --> 14:21.078
Johnny, come on.

14:21.648 --> 14:22.913
Hey, kid.

14:24.017 --> 14:25.752
Johnny! Come on!

14:27.522 --> 14:29.757
<i>¶ roll out the barrel ¶</i>

14:29.825 --> 14:32.694
Well, come on, you guys,
cheer up a little.

14:32.763 --> 14:34.564
Thanks, Molly.

14:38.471 --> 14:42.642
<i>¶ We've got the blues
on the run ¶</i>

14:42.710 --> 14:45.078
Ah, hiya, Johnny,
do you remember me?

14:45.147 --> 14:46.314
I'm, uh, Mike Monahan.

14:46.383 --> 14:47.548
I delivered
that load of fish

14:47.617 --> 14:48.984
at Fleckner Foods
the other night.

14:49.052 --> 14:50.586
Yeah, the fish guy.
What do you want?

14:50.655 --> 14:53.723
Oh, I was thinkin' maybe
you're lookin' for a job.

14:53.793 --> 14:54.825
You did, huh?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.093
What kind of work?

14:56.162 --> 14:57.496
Well, you see,
I'm the president

14:57.564 --> 14:59.499
of the Federation of Interstate Truckers,

14:59.567 --> 15:00.900
local 302, Johnny.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.068
The president is here.

15:02.137 --> 15:03.837
- You heard of it?
- No. I...

15:03.906 --> 15:05.139
He's talkin'
about the union.

15:05.208 --> 15:08.076
Well, it's, uh,
it's not much of one, uh.

15:08.145 --> 15:11.214
You mind if I, uh, sit down?

15:11.283 --> 15:14.620
You know, I figure
we got about a 100 guys right now.

15:14.689 --> 15:16.355
Look, Johnny,
I...I don't know

15:16.424 --> 15:18.758
how you feel about unions,
but I...I saw you at Fleckner's

15:18.827 --> 15:20.294
and, well,
you got a way with men.

15:20.363 --> 15:21.996
Yeah, I did a lot for 'em.
Come on.

15:22.065 --> 15:23.865
Well, look now,
the companies we work for

15:23.934 --> 15:26.202
are filled with, uh, creeps
like your Mr. Andrews.

15:26.270 --> 15:29.874
You know, they smile,
and then they stick it to you.

15:29.943 --> 15:31.576
What do you want me
to do about it?

15:31.645 --> 15:34.347
I want you to come to work for us
as an organizer.

15:34.415 --> 15:35.682
You go out
to the warehouses

15:35.751 --> 15:38.085
and sign up
as many guys as you can.

15:39.589 --> 15:43.192
What about my lawyer here?
We work together. This guy.

15:43.261 --> 15:44.962
I think
you both got a job.

15:45.030 --> 15:46.163
How much?

15:46.232 --> 15:47.499
Why, I can't
pay you nothing.

15:47.568 --> 15:48.967
But I'll give you
a...a commission

15:49.035 --> 15:50.236
for every guy
you sign up.

15:50.304 --> 15:52.137
Look, I don't know nothing
about trucks, Monahan.

15:52.206 --> 15:54.207
Well, I'll show you everything.
I'm not interested.

15:54.276 --> 15:55.510
You'll get an office.

15:55.579 --> 15:56.911
We might have a chance
to get even.

15:56.980 --> 15:58.280
He ain't
paying nothin', Abe.

15:58.349 --> 16:00.015
And you get a car.

16:00.853 --> 16:02.586
Get a car?

16:04.123 --> 16:08.027
Anna! Anna,
you remember me?

16:08.096 --> 16:09.763
From the Christmas dance
last year.

16:09.831 --> 16:11.965
I asked you to dance 3 times
and you didn't wanna.

16:12.034 --> 16:15.872
Wait, look, wait a minute!
Don't you remember?

16:15.940 --> 16:17.473
In case you're wondering
all the time

16:17.542 --> 16:19.009
what my name is,
it's Johnny Kovak.

16:19.077 --> 16:20.678
What's yours?

16:20.747 --> 16:22.313
You know what it is.

16:22.382 --> 16:25.284
No, your last name.
Come on, everybody's got one.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.053
Zerinkas!

16:27.122 --> 16:29.189
It's pretty. You Polack?

16:29.859 --> 16:30.959
I'm Lithuanian.

16:31.028 --> 16:32.628
Lithuanian. Sure not
many Lithuanians left.

16:32.696 --> 16:34.063
I thought
most of them were dead.

16:34.132 --> 16:35.498
You wanna go for a beer?

16:35.567 --> 16:37.401
For breakfast?
I...I don't drink beer.

16:37.470 --> 16:40.138
Well, then let's go
someplace and talk.

16:42.243 --> 16:43.777
What do you wanna
talk about?

16:43.846 --> 16:45.111
Me, I'll talk
about anything.

16:45.180 --> 16:48.015
Baseball, books,
the bible. I'm game.

16:48.084 --> 16:49.552
What do you know
about the bible?

16:49.620 --> 16:52.121
Are you... what do
I know about the bible?

16:52.190 --> 16:54.492
"An eye for an eye"
and all that. It's a great book.

16:54.561 --> 16:55.960
Do you always lie?

16:56.028 --> 16:58.464
If it'll help me get along
with stuck-up ladies, why not?

16:59.701 --> 17:01.268
Hey, wait a minute!
Where you going?

17:01.337 --> 17:02.603
To work.

17:02.672 --> 17:04.405
Well, lady, I'll give you a ride
to the gate.

17:04.474 --> 17:05.707
Come on.
I don't go for rides.

17:05.776 --> 17:07.609
Come on,
it'll impress your friends.

17:08.179 --> 17:10.813
I just washed the car,
come on.

17:10.882 --> 17:13.217
You're embarrassing me.
You're making me look bad.

17:14.420 --> 17:15.587
And can't you
even say goodbye?

17:15.655 --> 17:17.190
Bye!

17:17.258 --> 17:20.461
Hey, Anna, do all your friends here
know how stuck-up you are?

17:33.314 --> 17:34.746
Ok, fellows,
what's your business?

17:34.815 --> 17:35.882
We're with the union.

17:35.950 --> 17:38.285
Federation
of Interstate Truckers.

17:38.354 --> 17:39.920
Look, we just wanna
talk to the guys

17:39.990 --> 17:41.256
for a few minutes,
all right?

17:41.325 --> 17:43.393
Park this outside,
and I'll go check upstairs.

17:43.461 --> 17:45.295
Thank you.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.498
What're you
thankin' him for?

18:00.251 --> 18:03.320
A couple of union boys.

18:03.389 --> 18:05.890
You guys can go on in,
but I need some names first.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.526
Abe Belkin.

18:07.594 --> 18:09.328
Kovak,
Johnny Kovak.

18:16.441 --> 18:18.208
Keep an eye on 'em.

18:19.678 --> 18:20.744
...Benefits? How do we...

18:20.813 --> 18:21.946
Good morning.

18:22.014 --> 18:23.348
How are you?
My name is Johnny Kovak,

18:23.417 --> 18:24.683
we're from
the trucking union.

18:24.751 --> 18:26.352
Abe Belkin. How are you?
Nice meeting you.

18:26.421 --> 18:28.154
Listen, we just
wanna talk to you about...

18:28.223 --> 18:30.091
but we're
not interested.

18:30.159 --> 18:31.493
Wait, aren't you interested in better
working conditions?

18:31.562 --> 18:32.994
I said
we're not interested.

18:33.063 --> 18:34.730
I know what you said,
but we just wanna talk to you...

18:34.799 --> 18:36.500
you heard
what he said.

18:36.569 --> 18:37.734
Yeah,
what is your name?

18:37.803 --> 18:39.504
Richman.
Richman, ok.

18:39.573 --> 18:41.107
Uh, Abe, why don't
we come back?

18:41.175 --> 18:43.743
We'll talk to these guys later.
We'll talk to you, uh, well...

18:46.616 --> 18:48.750
Who the hell
are those guys?

18:48.819 --> 18:50.719
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

18:50.787 --> 18:52.155
Wait,
I'm Johnny Kovak.

18:52.224 --> 18:53.323
We're from the, uh,
truckers' union...

18:53.391 --> 18:54.525
give me a break,
will you?

18:54.594 --> 18:55.926
We just wanna
talk about the pay...

18:55.995 --> 18:57.695
I pay my dues.
Just leave me alone, all right?

18:57.764 --> 19:00.500
We'll get you more money.
We'll get you better...

19:01.703 --> 19:03.703
come on,
5 minutes.

19:12.918 --> 19:14.919
We've got a meeting,
8:00, Friday night,

19:14.988 --> 19:18.224
St. Stephen's basement.
I hope some of you guys show up.

19:18.293 --> 19:19.527
Come on.

19:31.878 --> 19:33.512
Come on, Johnny.

19:44.629 --> 19:46.463
How long have
we been out, 14 hours?

19:46.532 --> 19:47.832
13, 3 sign-ups.

19:47.901 --> 19:50.303
We got 2 sign-ups
and one "maybe."

19:55.245 --> 19:56.644
Any trucks been around?

19:56.713 --> 19:57.913
I don't know.
It's been slow.

19:57.981 --> 19:59.181
Where's the driver
of that rig?

19:59.250 --> 20:01.017
I don't know.
I haven't seen him.

20:01.086 --> 20:03.321
Is he inside?
I don't know.

20:03.389 --> 20:04.755
Listen,
would you put in

20:04.824 --> 20:07.025
about 60 cents' worth of gas
and check the oil? Ok?

20:07.094 --> 20:08.761
- Sure.
- Wait up, Abe.

20:11.701 --> 20:12.900
Am I beat.

20:12.969 --> 20:14.035
That's some rig.

20:14.104 --> 20:15.203
Yeah.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.110
It's an independent.
Mmm-hmm.

20:20.178 --> 20:21.312
Yeah.

20:22.616 --> 20:25.719
"Higgins hauling service."

20:25.787 --> 20:27.287
Hey, anybody in there?
Huh?

20:27.356 --> 20:28.723
Get the hell away
from my rig.

20:28.791 --> 20:30.157
Hey, we're from the union.
Come on.

20:30.226 --> 20:32.527
Bullshit!
We're signin' up members.

20:32.596 --> 20:35.030
Last time somebody
knocked on my door, they took my load.

20:35.099 --> 20:37.100
We're not gonna to take anything.
Show him the card.

20:37.169 --> 20:39.237
Federation of Interstate
Truckers, Abe Belkin.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.505
That's right.

20:40.574 --> 20:42.608
Ok, you're with the union.
Now get out of here.

20:42.677 --> 20:44.177
Wait, don't you wanna
do something

20:44.246 --> 20:46.080
about what the companies
are doin' to the drivers?

20:46.149 --> 20:47.582
If you sign up
with the union,

20:47.651 --> 20:49.017
they can't screw you so bad.
You know that?

20:49.086 --> 20:50.552
Upside down
they can screw you.

20:50.621 --> 20:51.721
And start
all over again.

20:51.790 --> 20:53.556
Not if everybody
signs up.

20:53.626 --> 20:56.428
Yeah? Well, I'll sign up when everybody else
has signed up. How's that?

20:56.497 --> 20:58.330
We can give you more clout
with the company.

20:58.399 --> 20:59.965
Now don't you
understand that?

21:00.034 --> 21:01.735
You 2 guys?

21:05.509 --> 21:06.475
No, the union.

21:06.544 --> 21:07.843
Yeah. You sure
you and Abie here

21:07.912 --> 21:09.879
just don't wanna
collect dues?

21:09.948 --> 21:11.949
You can make the dues up
in the raises the union will get you.

21:11.968 --> 21:14.603
Bullshit!

21:14.672 --> 21:16.939
All right, you wanna end up
like Joe Harper,

21:17.008 --> 21:18.074
that's your business.

21:18.143 --> 21:19.876
What happened to Joe?

21:19.945 --> 21:21.278
Joe Harper, pushing too hard
for the company,

21:21.347 --> 21:22.947
went off the road,
cracked up, no insurance,

21:23.016 --> 21:24.750
nothing
for his family.

21:24.819 --> 21:26.018
As a matter of fact,
he had a rig just like this.

21:26.087 --> 21:27.187
Wait a minute.

21:27.256 --> 21:29.089
Hey, look, we got a meeting
Friday night, 8:00,

21:29.158 --> 21:31.058
St. Stephen's basement.

21:31.128 --> 21:33.895
Hey, what's your name?

21:33.964 --> 21:35.698
Kovak,
Johnny Kovak.

21:36.835 --> 21:38.136
What's yours?

21:38.204 --> 21:41.140
Tom Higgins.
Everybody knows me.

21:41.208 --> 21:44.745
I'll see you Friday,
won't I, Tom?

21:44.813 --> 21:47.080
But I ain't gonna
sign nothin'.

21:49.787 --> 21:51.287
Now, you guys know

21:51.356 --> 21:52.989
that the companies
have been

21:53.058 --> 21:56.161
putting it to us
worse than ever before.

21:56.229 --> 21:58.364
And the only way
we got of holding 'em off

21:58.432 --> 22:00.967
is by getting together.

22:01.036 --> 22:02.703
That's what
a union's all about.

22:14.221 --> 22:15.488
Hi, Joe.

22:22.933 --> 22:25.100
Hi, Joe, how the hell
are you?

22:27.072 --> 22:29.674
All right, you guys,
this is Johnny Kovak.

22:29.742 --> 22:30.942
Good work, John.

22:31.011 --> 22:32.143
John.

22:43.329 --> 22:46.531
Most of you guys
know Joe Harper.

22:46.600 --> 22:49.968
Joe Harper was
one of the first guys with this union.

22:50.037 --> 22:52.939
Paying dues
more than 20 years.

22:53.007 --> 22:54.908
Showin' up at meetings.

22:54.977 --> 22:56.778
Doin' what he was asked.

22:58.115 --> 22:59.749
Bein' a brother.

23:02.054 --> 23:04.088
All his life he run
from one place to another

23:04.157 --> 23:06.325
to support his family.

23:06.394 --> 23:08.127
The only damn
the company gave about him

23:08.195 --> 23:09.863
was to have him
run more and more.

23:09.931 --> 23:12.267
Till he run himself
off the road.

23:15.306 --> 23:19.076
Now the company
don't give a damn at all.

23:19.145 --> 23:21.480
But I wanna tell you guys
something...

23:23.384 --> 23:26.118
We ain't askin' the company
for nothin'.

23:26.187 --> 23:29.090
'Cause we're gonna
take care of Joe.

23:29.159 --> 23:31.727
We're taking care
of his doctor bills.

23:33.264 --> 23:35.632
We're taking care
of his family.

23:35.701 --> 23:38.102
'Cause Joe's
a good union man

23:38.171 --> 23:41.507
and we're taking care of him
and the people he loves.

23:43.144 --> 23:45.979
And I'll tell you
somethin' else,

23:46.048 --> 23:48.116
you join this union,

23:48.185 --> 23:50.986
we'll get you money
for overtime

23:51.055 --> 23:52.956
and doctor bills.

23:53.025 --> 23:55.092
And you won't have
to kill yourself makin' a buck

23:55.161 --> 23:57.830
like you're doin' now,
like my old man did.

24:00.803 --> 24:03.237
You join this union
and make it strong,

24:03.306 --> 24:04.639
it'll make you strong.

24:04.708 --> 24:06.241
And I swear to you,
as I'm standing here

24:06.310 --> 24:08.177
that no company bastard
livin' up in the heights

24:08.246 --> 24:11.615
is gonna come down here
and walk all over your lives.

24:20.230 --> 24:21.996
I promise you that.

24:24.034 --> 24:26.370
Come on, Joe, let's go.

24:38.221 --> 24:39.855
Where do I sign?

25:01.287 --> 25:04.723
Yeah. We're doing pretty good,
we're over 300 this month.

25:04.792 --> 25:06.426
With this guy,
Vince Kiniwaski?

25:06.494 --> 25:08.862
Yeah?
That brings it up to 300.

25:08.931 --> 25:12.033
I think we'll be up to about 400
by 3 or 4 weeks.

25:12.101 --> 25:13.501
Oh, yeah,
Abe is out right now.

25:13.571 --> 25:15.504
We're going big,
aren't we? Uh-huh.

25:15.573 --> 25:17.373
It's Abe's idea.
We take a billboard,

25:17.443 --> 25:18.676
we split the billboard up

25:18.745 --> 25:20.445
and explain exactly
what the F.I.S.T. Stands for.

25:21.849 --> 25:24.050
Uh-huh, yeah listen,
yeah, Abe is still out.

25:24.118 --> 25:25.718
I'll get back to you
in a minute, Mike.

25:25.787 --> 25:27.321
Yeah, ok. Bye.

25:28.926 --> 25:30.692
Mr. Kovak,
I'm Arthur St. Clair.

25:30.761 --> 25:33.028
General counsel
for consolidated trucking.

25:33.097 --> 25:34.865
I know who you are.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.302
May I sit down?

25:40.675 --> 25:42.041
It occurs to me,
Mr. Kovak,

25:42.110 --> 25:45.245
that we have some concerns
in common.

25:45.314 --> 25:46.413
In different ways,

25:46.483 --> 25:48.817
we're both concerned
about truckers.

25:48.886 --> 25:52.690
You for the union
and, uh, your commission.

25:52.758 --> 25:55.994
And I... I'm concerned
with the company and our profits, of course.

25:56.062 --> 25:58.831
Of course.

25:58.900 --> 26:02.103
It's been brought to my attention,
Mr. Kovak that, uh,

26:02.171 --> 26:03.437
you have a special talent

26:03.507 --> 26:06.642
for communicating
with drivers.

26:06.711 --> 26:08.712
I'd like to put that talent
to work.

26:08.780 --> 26:09.981
Uh-huh?

26:13.654 --> 26:15.788
How you gonna do that?

26:15.857 --> 26:19.226
By hiring you to work for us.

26:19.294 --> 26:21.763
Now think about it
seriously, Mr. Kovak.

26:21.832 --> 26:24.867
Think of the good you can do
from inside the company,

26:24.937 --> 26:27.070
helping our drivers.

26:27.139 --> 26:30.543
What about the men?
What about the union?

26:30.611 --> 26:33.446
Well, your associate,
Mr. Belkin could carry on for you.

26:33.515 --> 26:35.315
Money, of course,
is no problem.

26:35.384 --> 26:37.618
We'd be happy to double
whatever you're making now

26:37.688 --> 26:39.721
in salary
and commissions.

26:50.004 --> 26:51.171
It's not bad.

26:51.239 --> 26:53.107
Very not bad, I'd say.

26:58.336 --> 27:00.805
You know somethin',
St. Clair?

27:00.873 --> 27:04.009
When I first took this job,
I had a feeling

27:04.078 --> 27:06.012
that if I did
a good enough job,

27:06.081 --> 27:07.880
sooner or later somebody would come
walking up those stairs.

27:07.949 --> 27:09.449
Somebody like you.

27:09.518 --> 27:11.185
And they'd sit in that chair,

27:11.254 --> 27:13.422
and they'd tell me
what you're telling me now.

27:13.491 --> 27:17.728
And I knew then
what I was gonna say, and I know now.

27:17.796 --> 27:19.998
Why don't you get
the hell out of my office?

27:20.066 --> 27:22.467
You're stinkin' up
union property.

27:23.739 --> 27:26.173
As you get older, Kovak,

27:26.242 --> 27:28.977
you'll find that
civility can be learned,

27:29.680 --> 27:31.681
sometimes even taught.

27:34.319 --> 27:37.122
When you change your mind,
give me a call.

28:07.166 --> 28:09.032
You're 4 short,
Miss Zerinkas.

28:09.101 --> 28:10.168
No.

28:11.637 --> 28:13.238
What's the matter
with you?

28:13.307 --> 28:15.241
I wasn't going
to touch you.

28:15.310 --> 28:17.912
1, 2, 3, 4.
I'm not short.

28:17.980 --> 28:19.815
Now if you wanna keep your job here
I'm not...

28:19.883 --> 28:22.284
you'd better learn
to start cooperating, Miss Zerinkas.

28:22.353 --> 28:24.320
I've never been short on my count,
Mr. Burke.

28:24.388 --> 28:25.889
You know that!

28:27.928 --> 28:29.728
Ae knows that.

28:49.523 --> 28:50.624
Goodnight, George.

28:50.692 --> 28:51.792
Anna.

28:51.861 --> 28:52.994
What do you
want?

28:53.063 --> 28:54.395
What's the matter?

28:54.464 --> 28:56.365
Anna, are you crying?
What's the matter?

28:56.433 --> 28:57.432
Nothing.

28:57.501 --> 28:58.601
You look like
you're cryin'.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.036
Did somebody do
something to you?

29:00.105 --> 29:02.006
No.
What's the matter?

29:02.075 --> 29:03.341
Don't you ever cry?

29:03.410 --> 29:04.910
Ah, yeah, I cry
when I peel onions,

29:04.979 --> 29:07.446
but you look like you're
a little bit more upset than that.

29:07.515 --> 29:08.849
Want to grab some beer?

29:08.918 --> 29:10.718
I told you
I don't drink beer.

29:10.788 --> 29:12.821
How about some coffee?
Want to get some coffee?

29:12.890 --> 29:14.356
No, you don't want
no coffee either.

29:14.425 --> 29:15.591
How about some ice cream?

29:15.661 --> 29:17.161
Come on,
everybody likes ice cream.

29:17.229 --> 29:18.830
What do you like,
you like vanilla?

29:18.899 --> 29:21.500
Do you like chocolate?
No chocolate?

29:21.568 --> 29:22.802
How about strawberry?

29:22.870 --> 29:25.238
Come on, I know
you like strawberry, right?

29:25.307 --> 29:27.308
I can see you smilin' already.
You smilin'?

29:27.376 --> 29:28.932
I know
there's a smile in there.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.165
You want to get
some strawberry?

29:30.234 --> 29:31.267
I know a great place.

29:31.336 --> 29:32.268
Cheap, too.

29:32.337 --> 29:33.604
Oh, no, no hands.

29:33.672 --> 29:35.439
You mean, you don't
want me to touch you?

29:35.507 --> 29:37.743
No hands, all right.
No hands.

29:39.380 --> 29:40.880
I was thinkin', Anna,

29:40.949 --> 29:42.515
it's gonna be very difficult
driving with no hands.

29:42.584 --> 29:44.418
But we'll work
somethin' out.

29:44.487 --> 29:46.255
You ever tried to shift
with your elbows?

29:46.323 --> 29:48.690
I've never driven a car.

29:48.761 --> 29:51.061
And maybe by the end of the summer
we'll be up around 500.

29:51.130 --> 29:52.730
What we're trying
to do with the union

29:52.799 --> 29:54.532
is make sure none of the guys
get stepped on

29:54.601 --> 29:55.600
by the companies
anymore.

29:55.669 --> 29:57.070
That's what
the problem is,

29:57.139 --> 29:59.140
that's what it's always been
around here.

29:59.208 --> 30:00.641
I was thinking that maybe we ought to go
see a show sometime.

30:00.709 --> 30:02.911
Mmm. At the factory
where I work...

30:02.980 --> 30:04.613
Yeah?

30:04.682 --> 30:07.017
...2 of the girls tried to start a union,
and they threw 'em out.

30:07.086 --> 30:09.154
Oh, that's rough.
That was rough.

30:09.222 --> 30:11.256
I was, uh, reading
in the paper the other day

30:11.324 --> 30:13.325
where they have Ginger Rogers
appearing nightly,

30:13.394 --> 30:14.795
down at The Orpheum.

30:14.863 --> 30:16.798
She's a good dancer.
You ever seen her dance?

30:16.866 --> 30:20.102
No, and now they can't get a job
anywhere in this entire city.

30:20.171 --> 30:22.038
Hmm.

30:22.107 --> 30:24.608
That's rough. Maybe I can
talk to some people about that, help out.

30:24.677 --> 30:25.609
Oh, would you?

30:25.678 --> 30:27.279
Yeah, I was thinking,

30:27.347 --> 30:29.047
the way you're sitting there
eating that ice cream cone,

30:29.116 --> 30:31.483
you kind of remind me
of Ginger Rogers, you know that?

30:31.552 --> 30:34.054
You do. Saturday night,
I'm free.

30:35.458 --> 30:36.490
I got plans.

30:36.559 --> 30:38.294
Got plans? Well, so do I.

30:39.096 --> 30:40.997
Sunday night?

30:41.066 --> 30:42.499
I got plans.

30:42.568 --> 30:44.837
You sure got
a lot of plans.

30:44.905 --> 30:47.105
What do you think
you'll be doing next Easter?

30:47.174 --> 30:48.208
Hmm?

30:48.276 --> 30:49.642
You always so pushy?

30:49.711 --> 30:53.048
Yeah, when I really
want something. Hmm?

30:53.116 --> 30:55.384
Maybe I'll check my schedule here,
see if, uh,

30:55.453 --> 30:59.289
I got a cancellation
for next Saturday, 9:00.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.726
Strawberry girl,
you could be available?

31:01.794 --> 31:02.794
Hmm?

31:02.864 --> 31:03.963
No hands?

31:04.031 --> 31:06.532
No hands?
I'll make you a deal.

31:06.601 --> 31:07.700
What?

31:09.105 --> 31:12.040
No hands if, uh, I can
have this ice cream cone.

31:12.050 --> 31:13.500
Ok?
- Ok.

31:13.501 --> 31:15.134
Ok.

31:15.203 --> 31:16.670
I'll call you up, ok?

31:16.739 --> 31:18.806
How you doing, Bob?
How's the wife treating you?

31:18.876 --> 31:20.308
We'll get back
in about 3 days,

31:20.377 --> 31:22.111
I think everything
should be ok, all right.

31:22.180 --> 31:23.580
Thank you
for your time.

31:23.648 --> 31:25.783
Johnny Kovak,
take care of yourself.

31:27.087 --> 31:28.687
Hi, George.
Hey, Johnny.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.289
Hey, listen,
there's a guy over there

31:30.358 --> 31:32.125
in a consolidated truck
wants to talk to you.

31:32.194 --> 31:33.594
Uh-huh?
Yeah, he might wanna sign up.

31:33.662 --> 31:35.263
All right,
thanks a lot.

31:35.331 --> 31:36.765
Watch out for Myrtle's Coffee,
she's on the warpath.

31:36.833 --> 31:38.534
Ok, will do.

31:54.926 --> 31:56.192
Hey, you wanted
to see me?

31:56.261 --> 31:57.794
Yeah, I was thinkin'
about signin' up.

31:57.862 --> 31:59.563
Oh, good, good, good.
What's your name?

31:59.632 --> 32:01.333
Jack.
- Jack. Jack what?

32:01.402 --> 32:03.535
Jack...
- Kovak,

32:03.603 --> 32:05.405
I wanna sign up,
too.

32:07.510 --> 32:09.244
Oh, God!

32:49.535 --> 32:50.701
Yeah?

32:52.573 --> 32:55.642
<i>Have you given my proposition
further thought?</i>

33:03.721 --> 33:06.490
Come on in. Show your cards
or your buttons.

33:08.161 --> 33:10.563
Show your cards or your buttons.
Come on in and take a seat.

33:11.465 --> 33:12.999
Uh, Tom, I...

33:13.068 --> 33:14.467
you wanna
close the doors back there

33:14.536 --> 33:17.205
so we can get
the, uh, meeting started?

33:18.742 --> 33:21.944
Uh, we have with us here
tonight from Indianapolis,

33:22.013 --> 33:25.317
a man you all know
or heard about.

33:25.385 --> 33:28.454
He's gonna swear in
all you new members.

33:28.523 --> 33:32.726
A man...Who's a real legend
in the union movement.

33:32.794 --> 33:34.128
It's Henry Ford!

33:36.033 --> 33:37.700
Come on now, Tom, now.

33:37.768 --> 33:40.671
Let's...let's settle down,
guys, settle down.

33:42.242 --> 33:44.075
Max Graham.

33:44.144 --> 33:46.679
The national president
of this union.

33:59.366 --> 34:02.234
First,
I wanna thank Mike Monahan

34:02.303 --> 34:05.405
for the fancy introduction.

34:05.474 --> 34:07.808
I wanna talk to you guys
about somethin'

34:07.877 --> 34:10.110
I've been seein'
every place I go.

34:10.179 --> 34:11.380
Skirts!

34:17.623 --> 34:21.260
Any of you real smart guys
wanna crack wise,

34:21.329 --> 34:24.063
get the hell out of here
and do it outside!

34:24.132 --> 34:26.199
I don't wanna think
the company sent you in here

34:26.268 --> 34:28.235
to disrupt this meetin'.

34:30.007 --> 34:31.842
What I wanna talk to you about

34:31.911 --> 34:33.976
is this business
of Bolshevik agitating.

34:34.045 --> 34:35.320
Have you come across
any Bolsheviks?

34:35.322 --> 34:36.856
- You know what I mean.
- Huh?

34:36.925 --> 34:39.592
I seen 'em in Pittsburgh,
I seen 'em in Detroit,

34:39.661 --> 34:42.797
and you got 'em
right here in Cleveland.

34:42.866 --> 34:47.904
Fancy guys with smart words,
lots of talk,

34:47.974 --> 34:50.442
they're trying to stir up good union men
against the system.

34:51.745 --> 34:53.712
Now I know we got problems
with the companies,

34:53.781 --> 34:56.851
but that's why we're here.
That's why we got a union.

34:56.918 --> 34:58.953
That's why we pledge
to obey all the laws

34:59.022 --> 35:01.256
and to aid
our member brothers.

35:03.095 --> 35:06.864
To iron these things out
with our bosses, your bosses.

35:06.933 --> 35:09.234
To make sure
the company makes a profit.

35:09.303 --> 35:10.903
Now, you know
what I'm talkin' about?

35:10.972 --> 35:13.540
If the companies don't make a profit,
we don't make a profit.

35:14.777 --> 35:15.877
Now,

35:17.748 --> 35:20.650
I want to talk to you about
getting your dues in on time.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.353
Oh!

35:22.422 --> 35:24.155
Get off your asses
and pay your dues.

35:25.493 --> 35:26.958
How you doing, jugs?
Johnny, how are you?

35:27.028 --> 35:28.228
Oh, thank you.

35:28.296 --> 35:29.695
Every bohunk in here
know him?

35:29.764 --> 35:31.232
Yeah, everybody
likes Johnny.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.800
It's for you, Mishka.
Thanks.

35:32.869 --> 35:34.702
Hey, Molly.
He wants to go out with you.

35:34.771 --> 35:35.938
Who?

35:36.007 --> 35:38.275
The gentleman you like,
Abe.

35:38.344 --> 35:39.609
...Couldn't fix a damn truck.

35:39.678 --> 35:40.845
She wants to go out
with you.

35:40.914 --> 35:41.946
Come on,
how do you know?

35:42.015 --> 35:43.449
I know.
If you don't, I will.

35:43.518 --> 35:44.783
Yeah,
you would, too.

35:44.852 --> 35:46.786
She's got
a great frame on her.

35:46.855 --> 35:48.822
You're not a driver,
are you, Kovak?

35:48.891 --> 35:50.992
Well,
not like you guys, no.

35:51.062 --> 35:52.494
I didn't think so.

35:52.563 --> 35:54.064
- She's...
- stirrin' all these men up.

35:54.132 --> 35:55.366
All this
grandstandin'.

35:55.435 --> 35:57.435
What grandstandin'?
What are you talkin', Max?

35:57.503 --> 35:59.438
We've grown
since Johnny come in, right?

35:59.506 --> 36:00.873
You mean he's grown.

36:00.942 --> 36:02.408
You make a commission
on each one?

36:02.477 --> 36:04.478
Yeah, I do my...
I do my job.

36:04.547 --> 36:05.880
You makin' a name
for yourself?

36:05.949 --> 36:07.182
You put money
in your mattress?

36:07.250 --> 36:08.284
Hey, Max.

36:08.352 --> 36:10.853
He never even
drove a truck.

36:10.922 --> 36:11.921
I'll see you guys later.

36:11.990 --> 36:13.591
Johnny, hey, wait!

36:13.659 --> 36:16.161
Pretty soon, the company
will come along and offer you somethin'.

36:16.230 --> 36:19.165
And you'll take. You'll take.

36:27.579 --> 36:29.201
Johnny, come on.

36:29.202 --> 36:31.101
Max, what the hell's wrong
with you?

36:31.170 --> 36:33.372
Come on, Abe. Abe,
Johnny, come on back, have another beer.

36:33.441 --> 36:34.641
You didn't
finish your drink.

36:34.710 --> 36:36.008
Oh, Jesus!
I'm sorry, Molly.

36:36.077 --> 36:37.745
That's ok.

36:37.814 --> 36:39.348
I'm off Friday.

36:39.416 --> 36:40.816
You're on.

37:01.246 --> 37:02.646
Does Anna Zerinkas
live here?

37:02.715 --> 37:03.881
Yeah, that's
where she lives.

37:03.949 --> 37:05.283
Thank you.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.068
Now get away from there.

37:20.707 --> 37:22.374
Hi, Johnny Kovak,
from the union.

37:22.443 --> 37:23.642
- Oh, yeah.
- How are you?

37:23.711 --> 37:25.111
How are you?

37:31.822 --> 37:34.557
Hi. Hey, hey, Anna, we've got a date.
What the...

37:34.626 --> 37:36.660
today's Friday. Our date
is for tomorrow night.

37:36.729 --> 37:37.762
Yeah, I know that...

37:37.831 --> 37:39.464
I know that,
but today don't bother me.

37:39.533 --> 37:42.134
Well, it...it bothers me.
I mean, uh...

37:42.202 --> 37:44.037
No, don't worry
about way you're dressed.

37:44.105 --> 37:46.173
So you're not
dressed to kill.

37:46.242 --> 37:47.910
It's ok.
- What are you, drunk?

37:47.978 --> 37:49.645
Well, I just had a little beer
with the guys

37:49.713 --> 37:51.213
- down at the bar, nothing serious.
- Oh.

37:51.282 --> 37:52.615
I don't think
you're funny.

37:52.684 --> 37:54.151
You don't?

37:56.122 --> 37:57.489
I think
you're funny.

37:57.558 --> 37:58.991
What you mean by that?

37:59.060 --> 38:01.227
Uh, I mean, don't worry
about the way you're dressed,

38:01.296 --> 38:02.663
I can take you
some place dark.

38:02.731 --> 38:03.932
No one has to see it.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.299
Uh-huh, well,
I can't go.

38:05.368 --> 38:06.869
Oh, you can't?

38:08.005 --> 38:09.606
Well, why not?

38:09.675 --> 38:11.776
Because, uh,
I... I've got a headache.

38:11.845 --> 38:13.445
You got a headache?

38:13.514 --> 38:14.913
From what?
I just got here.

38:14.982 --> 38:17.149
Well, I got a headache
from some slob

38:17.218 --> 38:19.553
standing on my doorstep
insulting me!

38:19.622 --> 38:21.490
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Wait, wait.

38:21.558 --> 38:23.057
Is your... is your mother home?

38:23.126 --> 38:24.360
Why?

38:24.428 --> 38:25.461
'Cause if I can't go out
with you,

38:25.530 --> 38:26.964
I'd like to go out
with the original.

38:27.032 --> 38:28.131
Ooh!

38:29.703 --> 38:33.171
Should have waited till Saturday,
that's the problem.

38:33.240 --> 38:35.341
Hey, looks like
a lockout, huh?

38:46.793 --> 38:48.159
Hi, Johnny.

38:48.228 --> 38:49.294
Hi, John.

38:57.875 --> 38:59.342
Here, take the car,
will you?

38:59.411 --> 39:00.944
What's the matter?
Where's your date?

39:01.013 --> 39:03.280
Uh, she was late,
so I stood her up, you know.

39:03.349 --> 39:05.250
Doesn't matter. Here.

39:05.318 --> 39:07.053
He's crazy about you,
isn't he?

39:07.121 --> 39:09.590
You got what it takes.
See you around.

39:09.659 --> 39:11.625
Yeah.

39:11.694 --> 39:13.428
Hey, Johnny,
where you going?

39:13.496 --> 39:15.531
Yeah, where am I going?
Yeah, she looks a little like

39:15.600 --> 39:17.400
Ginger Rogers,
don't you think?

39:20.206 --> 39:21.940
Is he always
like that?

39:22.009 --> 39:24.109
What do you expect,
he's a hunky.

39:26.915 --> 39:28.716
Did you like
the movie?

39:29.954 --> 39:31.019
No.

39:31.655 --> 39:32.789
You didn't?

39:32.857 --> 39:35.926
I'm just kidding you.

39:35.995 --> 39:38.597
You're really a sucker,
you know that?

39:54.286 --> 39:55.821
Goodnight, Abe.

39:56.423 --> 39:57.824
Goodnight, Molly.

40:02.431 --> 40:03.798
Goodnight.

40:22.225 --> 40:23.325
Shit!

40:53.737 --> 40:56.237
All right. You guys saw
what they did to Abe, right?

40:56.307 --> 40:57.673
Yeah!

40:57.742 --> 40:59.743
We can't just go
runnin' out and strike,

40:59.812 --> 41:02.113
for Christ's sake,
just because somebody got hurt.

41:02.182 --> 41:05.350
I didn't join up to lose my job,
Johnny. Uh, did we?

41:06.955 --> 41:09.423
I don't wanna strike
no more than you do, Tom.

41:09.491 --> 41:10.925
I don't want
nobody to lose jobs.

41:10.993 --> 41:13.561
None of you guys.
What you gettin' from us?

41:13.630 --> 41:14.563
Nothin'.

41:14.632 --> 41:15.965
Are they paying you
overtime?

41:16.034 --> 41:17.234
No.

41:17.302 --> 41:18.168
They paying
your doctor's bills?

41:18.237 --> 41:19.303
No. They sure ain't.

41:19.372 --> 41:21.472
All we've been doing so far
is takin' your dues.

41:21.541 --> 41:23.943
Look, look, look, what me
and Mike are gonna do,

41:24.011 --> 41:26.146
we're gonna go in there
and we're gonna talk to 'em.

41:26.215 --> 41:27.915
Oh, so that's Kovak.

41:27.984 --> 41:30.285
That's him.

41:30.354 --> 41:33.456
How many of our drivers
has he signed up so far?

41:33.959 --> 41:35.359
About 60%.

41:43.639 --> 41:45.941
I know these foreigners
around here.

41:46.009 --> 41:48.411
They're a good,
simple people.

41:48.479 --> 41:50.780
They like to have
a lot of laughs

41:50.849 --> 41:52.383
and have a beer.

41:52.452 --> 41:54.352
And don't take no crap.

42:02.065 --> 42:03.432
Hello, I'm Phillip Talbot.

42:03.500 --> 42:05.033
I'm, uh,
Mike Monahan and...

42:05.103 --> 42:06.202
This is our organizer,

42:06.271 --> 42:07.570
Johnny Kovak.
Kovak.

42:07.639 --> 42:08.953
My father should
be here in a moment, gentlemen.

42:08.954 --> 42:09.987
I'm sorry for the delay.

42:10.056 --> 42:11.522
That's all right,
Mr. Talbot.

42:11.591 --> 42:13.224
We got the time.

42:13.293 --> 42:14.359
Sit down.
Sit down, Mike

42:14.428 --> 42:16.629
thanks.

42:16.698 --> 42:18.398
This is, uh, Mr. St. Clair,
our attorney.

42:18.467 --> 42:19.567
Yes, we've met.

42:19.635 --> 42:22.003
And Mr. Langley,
our comptroller.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.976
Mike, why are you
sitting here?

42:26.045 --> 42:27.912
What...what do you mean,
Johnny?

42:27.981 --> 42:30.348
If he's gonna sit there,
then you ought to sit down there.

42:30.417 --> 42:31.550
Oh, this is ok.

42:31.619 --> 42:33.519
No, it's not.
Come on, let's do it.

42:33.589 --> 42:35.289
Yeah? All right.

42:37.760 --> 42:39.861
We're gonna sit
down there.

42:44.937 --> 42:47.105
It's a good seat.
It sure is.

42:51.981 --> 42:53.581
Sorry I'm late,
gentlemen.

42:53.650 --> 42:57.252
Some of these meetings, you know, they go on.
Please, sit down.

43:01.094 --> 43:03.361
Why don't you, uh,
move down here,

43:03.430 --> 43:05.263
perhaps we can hear
each other better?

43:05.332 --> 43:08.267
No, we can hear fine.
Unless you guys wanna come down here.

43:10.272 --> 43:12.473
Oh, I think we can
hear just fine.

43:12.542 --> 43:13.643
Ok.

43:13.711 --> 43:15.111
Shall we begin?

43:15.179 --> 43:17.614
This is Mr. Monahan,
the president of the local...

43:17.683 --> 43:18.783
How do you do, Sir?

43:18.852 --> 43:22.420
Mr. Novak.
Kovak. Chief organizer.

43:22.489 --> 43:24.991
All right, Mr. Kovak,
what can we do for you?

43:25.060 --> 43:27.662
Well, Mike here's the president. I guess
he knows better than me,

43:27.730 --> 43:29.464
so why don't you
lay it out for 'em, Mike?

43:29.533 --> 43:30.532
Ok, Johnny.

43:30.600 --> 43:33.269
Certainly,
Mr. Monahan.

43:33.337 --> 43:35.105
Uh, the thing of it is,
Mr. Talbot,

43:35.174 --> 43:39.378
the, uh, the men
in our local are upset about a few things,

43:39.446 --> 43:42.783
and, well, uh, we wanted
to talk 'em over with you.

43:42.851 --> 43:46.353
Oh, I'm always willing
to discuss our men's problems.

43:46.422 --> 43:48.557
I want the men
to be happy.

43:48.625 --> 43:51.127
Well, the way
the men see it,

43:51.196 --> 43:54.399
the company ought to pay
for the medical bills

43:54.467 --> 43:56.301
when any guy gets hurt.

43:56.369 --> 43:59.138
And, uh, set up some
kind of an insurance plan

43:59.207 --> 44:00.307
for the family.

44:00.375 --> 44:02.243
How do we stand
on that?

44:02.312 --> 44:04.580
Our policy is the same as that
of the other companies.

44:04.648 --> 44:06.682
We don't have
our own insurance program,

44:06.751 --> 44:09.954
but as you know, we have, on occasion,
lent some of the men money,

44:10.023 --> 44:12.725
at standard rates
for medical emergencies.

44:12.793 --> 44:14.459
Some of the men
have already expressed

44:14.528 --> 44:17.030
their appreciation
to me personally, win.

44:17.099 --> 44:19.835
Oh, that's
very nice.

44:19.903 --> 44:22.371
I was thinking,
Mr. Talbot,

44:22.440 --> 44:25.342
not of your
lendin' the money,

44:25.410 --> 44:27.344
but of payin'
the bills.

44:30.484 --> 44:33.419
We're gonna cut 'em off,
pal, you know that?

44:37.260 --> 44:38.660
What did he say?

44:38.729 --> 44:41.597
I said we're gonna
cut 'em off, your balls.

44:44.237 --> 44:49.108
And what exactly do you mean
by that crudity, Mr. Kovak?

44:49.177 --> 44:50.911
I mean
we're gonna shut you down.

44:50.980 --> 44:52.079
I see.

44:52.148 --> 44:54.382
No, you don't see.

44:54.450 --> 44:56.485
You don't see nothin'. You guys don't hear nothin'.
You don't feel nothing.

44:56.553 --> 44:58.321
'Cause if you did,
we wouldn't be sittin' here.

44:58.390 --> 45:00.456
You're out of touch.

45:00.526 --> 45:02.126
I'll tell you what you're sufferin' from,
small eyes and fat asses.

45:02.195 --> 45:04.096
Is he speaking for you,
Mr. Monahan?

45:04.165 --> 45:06.632
Johnny's our organizer,
he knows what the men want.

45:06.701 --> 45:08.335
Well, I think
I've heard enough.

45:08.404 --> 45:09.770
No, you haven't heard enough!

45:09.839 --> 45:11.173
Damn it,
if a guy works overtime,

45:11.241 --> 45:12.507
why don't you
pay him overtime?

45:12.575 --> 45:14.710
If he needs insurance,
why don't you give him insurance?

45:14.779 --> 45:17.480
We don't like to come here beggin',
we're not askin' for charity.

45:17.549 --> 45:18.983
We're not asking you
to be generous,

45:19.052 --> 45:20.852
we're just asking you
to be smart businessmen.

45:20.922 --> 45:22.254
Ah, I see.

45:23.191 --> 45:26.460
Well, the answer is no,
Mr. Kovak.

45:27.530 --> 45:29.464
No insurance.

45:29.533 --> 45:30.966
No overtime.

45:31.769 --> 45:33.303
No pay raises.

45:35.875 --> 45:37.442
Let's go, Mike.

45:42.985 --> 45:44.652
Come on.

45:48.092 --> 45:52.163
Do you know how much money
you're gonna lose in a strike?

45:54.201 --> 45:56.101
He's unbelievable.

46:01.711 --> 46:03.711
I wanna talk to you.
Let go of me!

46:03.780 --> 46:05.848
I want to talk to you. Why did you do it?
What?

46:05.917 --> 46:07.017
Why did you
stand me up?

46:07.086 --> 46:08.318
Nobody comes
for me drunk.

46:08.387 --> 46:10.288
I was under control.
Who's control?

46:10.357 --> 46:13.092
The gentleman...
I ain't got the money to be a gentleman, all right?

46:13.160 --> 46:14.961
The gentlemen
who take me out,

46:15.030 --> 46:17.131
they knock on my door very politely.
Is that right?

46:17.200 --> 46:18.799
Yes,
they talk to my mother.

46:18.868 --> 46:20.468
What can I talk
to your mother about?

46:20.537 --> 46:21.603
The weather.

46:21.671 --> 46:23.672
- The weather?
- The weather.

46:23.741 --> 46:24.708
Jesus.

46:24.777 --> 46:25.976
They escort me
to their car,

46:26.045 --> 46:28.246
and sometimes
they even bring me flowers.

46:28.315 --> 46:29.247
Flowers?

46:29.316 --> 46:30.582
Flowers.

46:32.821 --> 46:33.787
You know, you're nuts.

46:33.855 --> 46:35.390
You know that, Anna?

46:35.458 --> 46:36.624
You know that?

46:36.692 --> 46:38.527
I look like
I got any flowers?

46:38.595 --> 46:40.030
What do you think I am,
a pansy?

46:40.098 --> 46:41.564
You think
I've got flowers on me?

46:59.825 --> 47:01.625
Are those for me?

47:17.216 --> 47:19.951
Good evening, my name is John Kovak,
from the union.

47:20.020 --> 47:22.421
I have a date with Anna, and I'm looking
for Anna's mother.

47:22.490 --> 47:25.258
I am Mrs. Zerinkas.
Come in, please.

47:25.327 --> 47:26.694
Thank you.

47:31.236 --> 47:32.702
Please.

47:35.208 --> 47:36.808
Sit down, yes.

47:39.881 --> 47:41.815
What beautiful roses.

47:41.884 --> 47:44.085
Oh, thank you.
They were havin' a sale,

47:44.154 --> 47:45.220
so I thought I'd...

47:46.357 --> 47:47.523
buy 'em.

47:47.591 --> 47:51.562
Maybe we should
put them in a vase?

47:51.631 --> 47:54.933
Oh, if it's ok with you,
I'd just like to hold them here in my hand.

47:55.002 --> 47:57.404
Yes. Just one moment
please.

47:57.472 --> 47:58.538
Ok.

48:00.343 --> 48:01.843
Anna!

48:01.912 --> 48:03.945
Your friend is here!

48:04.015 --> 48:06.583
I'll be down in a minute,
mama.

48:09.923 --> 48:11.757
- Ah, please.
- Thank you.

48:23.508 --> 48:26.177
This heat
is really somethin'.

48:26.245 --> 48:28.780
The humidity from the lake,
I think.

48:29.684 --> 48:30.816
Yeah.

48:33.422 --> 48:37.759
I like it when it's cold
because you can feel yourself breathe.

48:37.828 --> 48:41.565
And you don't sweat
through all your shirts.

48:41.633 --> 48:45.370
This is one of the hottest spells
we have had in years.

48:47.074 --> 48:49.442
That's very true.
Very true.

48:49.511 --> 48:51.579
I was thinkin' about that.

48:52.916 --> 48:55.284
You are not Lithuanian?

48:55.353 --> 48:57.253
No, I'm Hungarian.

48:57.322 --> 48:58.422
Hmm.

49:02.529 --> 49:03.562
Catholic?

49:03.631 --> 49:05.565
Oh, sure.
Since I was born.

49:07.837 --> 49:10.772
What have you 2 been
talking about behind my back?

49:10.841 --> 49:12.374
The weather.

49:12.443 --> 49:16.313
Oh, Johnny,
what beautiful flowers.

49:16.382 --> 49:17.848
You shouldn't have.

49:17.917 --> 49:21.454
Well, they were havin'
a sale so I thought, well, why not?

49:21.523 --> 49:23.056
Thank you.
- Hmm.

49:25.361 --> 49:29.265
I just love it
when it's so nice and warm,

49:29.333 --> 49:30.566
don't you, Johnny?

49:30.635 --> 49:34.572
Yeah, I was saying I like it,
it opens the pores.

49:34.641 --> 49:38.277
Mr. Kovak was just saying
how much he likes the cold.

49:41.350 --> 49:43.851
Oh, what I meant is,
I like it, uh, both ways.

49:43.920 --> 49:46.789
I like to be hot and cold
at the same time.

49:49.031 --> 49:50.630
I guess
I'd better be going.

49:50.699 --> 49:51.799
Well, have fun.

49:51.868 --> 49:53.334
Yes, I'll try, mama.

49:53.403 --> 49:55.171
Yeah, I'll have her back
in about a month or so.

49:55.239 --> 49:57.974
Oh, I'm sure.
It was nice meeting you.

50:00.447 --> 50:01.980
Bye-bye, mama.

50:02.049 --> 50:03.182
We'll have
a good time. Bye.

50:03.250 --> 50:05.718
Nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you.

50:13.798 --> 50:15.165
Don't stay out
too late.

50:15.234 --> 50:16.468
Yeah.

50:16.536 --> 50:17.502
Thank you.

50:17.571 --> 50:19.338
Goodnight, Anna!

50:19.407 --> 50:20.772
Goodbye!

50:20.841 --> 50:22.476
Boy, he's fancy dressed,
huh?

50:22.544 --> 50:24.912
Sure is, look at that tie.

50:27.418 --> 50:29.586
He came in
with flowers, too.

50:32.958 --> 50:34.426
- Bye.
- Bye.

50:42.705 --> 50:44.806
Oh, got it!

50:44.875 --> 50:47.277
Don't breathe.
Don't breathe.

50:47.346 --> 50:49.112
I do a great, great
train imitation.

50:49.181 --> 50:50.414
I've been doing it
all my life.

50:50.483 --> 50:51.582
Since I was a kid.

50:52.953 --> 50:54.453
Wanna hear a train?
Sure.

50:54.522 --> 50:55.588
Ok.

50:56.958 --> 50:57.991
Let me see.

50:59.362 --> 51:00.562
No. That's...

51:10.110 --> 51:11.543
Hey, Johnny.

51:11.679 --> 51:14.047
How are you doin'?
Hey, Vince.

51:15.518 --> 51:17.686
I was just showin' Anna here
my train imitation.

51:17.754 --> 51:19.054
Oh, yeah?

51:19.122 --> 51:20.956
Well, you always were
a bit of an engineer.

51:22.260 --> 51:24.461
I see you won
yourself a doll, too.

51:24.530 --> 51:26.498
Oh, yeah, Anna,
this is Vince Doyle and Jocko.

51:26.567 --> 51:27.933
I don't know the girls.

51:28.002 --> 51:29.302
This is bonnie
and Rosie.

51:29.370 --> 51:31.171
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.

51:31.240 --> 51:32.940
Boy, you always know
how to pick 'em,

51:33.009 --> 51:34.008
don't you, kid?

51:34.077 --> 51:35.711
Hey, Vince,
how about it, all right?

51:35.779 --> 51:37.879
Sorry.

51:37.949 --> 51:40.083
Hey, I hear you're
gonna take your guys out on strike?

51:40.151 --> 51:42.052
You're getting to be
a regular labor leader.

51:42.121 --> 51:45.290
Regular labor leader.
Well, I'm just doing my job.

51:45.359 --> 51:48.495
You're whistling
past the graveyard, kid.

51:48.564 --> 51:50.564
Well, I think I'm doin'
the right thing.

51:50.633 --> 51:52.634
Nobody's gonna break
that old man's back.

51:52.703 --> 51:54.437
Not in this town.

51:54.505 --> 51:55.872
We'll see.

51:57.809 --> 51:59.944
Well, we gotta go.

52:00.012 --> 52:00.979
I bet.

52:01.048 --> 52:02.381
Bye, doll.

52:06.922 --> 52:09.258
Who is that man?

52:09.326 --> 52:12.061
Oh, Vince?
Vince works for the church.

52:12.130 --> 52:13.296
Oh, really?

52:13.365 --> 52:14.898
No, he's just some guy
I grew up with.

52:14.967 --> 52:17.935
Of course, Vince never had
good manners like me.

52:18.004 --> 52:20.205
Hmm? Wanna go
spend some dimes?

52:20.275 --> 52:22.276
- Ok, yeah.
- Want to hear my train imitation?

52:22.344 --> 52:23.377
I heard it.

52:34.328 --> 52:35.960
All right,
everybody gather around.

52:36.029 --> 52:37.597
I want bright boy
here to hear this

52:37.666 --> 52:39.933
so he knows the rules.
We're on strike.

52:40.002 --> 52:41.602
That means
there's no trucks goin' in,

52:41.672 --> 52:43.070
there's no trucks
comin' out.

52:43.139 --> 52:44.973
This is the boundary.

52:47.680 --> 52:49.547
Well, what did
the police say?

52:49.616 --> 52:52.083
They'll be arrested the minute they
destroy any property.

52:52.152 --> 52:53.885
I told you
we'd be back, Talbot.

52:53.954 --> 52:55.288
I told you
we'd be back.

52:55.357 --> 52:56.356
We're on strike.

52:56.425 --> 52:57.458
You can't win.

52:57.527 --> 53:00.028
That damn
Roosevelt.

53:00.096 --> 53:03.032
What this country needs
is Douglas MacArthur.

53:14.182 --> 53:15.616
Hey, Jack, Roger.

53:15.685 --> 53:18.554
Rest of you guys
come on over here.

53:18.622 --> 53:20.022
You need a hand?

53:20.091 --> 53:22.091
What do you think?

53:22.160 --> 53:24.328
Isn't that all right?
Watch it, it's still wet.

53:24.397 --> 53:25.797
Take these
all over to Higgins.

53:52.903 --> 53:54.470
Ok, let's go,
lift it up.

53:54.539 --> 53:57.173
Watch it, don't tear
that canvas. That a way.

53:57.242 --> 53:58.276
Good.

53:58.344 --> 53:59.644
Tie it on
real tight.

53:59.713 --> 54:00.679
That a away.

54:00.748 --> 54:02.815
Campbell,
take that rope.

54:02.884 --> 54:04.317
Where you goin'?

54:04.386 --> 54:06.120
Campbell,
take that rope.

54:06.188 --> 54:07.555
Sure, Mike.

54:10.027 --> 54:11.927
Yeah, right up, right up
in the middle.

54:11.996 --> 54:13.697
Father, you know
these fellows here.

54:13.766 --> 54:15.132
How are you?

54:15.200 --> 54:16.367
Hello, father.

54:17.337 --> 54:19.405
It's a 3-ring circus.

54:19.474 --> 54:20.673
Keep going, come on.

54:20.742 --> 54:23.076
You said it wouldn't even
last a month, Arthur.

54:23.145 --> 54:26.214
They can't hold out
much longer, Sir.

54:26.283 --> 54:28.517
Well, that bohunk's
not gonna put

54:28.586 --> 54:31.020
a circus tent
on my doorstep.

54:31.089 --> 54:33.324
Call the law and order league.

54:36.273 --> 54:40.477
¶ let's go down
and join the union ¶

54:40.545 --> 54:44.583

55:01.374 --> 55:03.776
Thanks, ma'am. Thank you.

55:06.348 --> 55:07.648
How you holdin' up?

55:07.717 --> 55:09.017
Pretty good.
How about yourself?

55:09.085 --> 55:11.153
Oh, I can go
another 8 hours.

55:11.222 --> 55:13.056
You washed more cups?

55:13.125 --> 55:14.959
I finally got you
something to eat.

55:15.028 --> 55:16.527
- Oh, boy.
- It's not much but go ahead.

55:16.595 --> 55:17.629
Thanks, lady.
- Ok.

55:17.698 --> 55:19.097
¶ hey, let's go down ¶

There you go.

55:26.276 --> 55:28.510
Oh, hi, Molly.
There you go.

There's a truck.
There's a truck.

55:53.196 --> 55:54.963
Block the gate.
Block the gate.

56:02.410 --> 56:03.910
Mike,
they've got guns.

56:03.978 --> 56:05.245
Hold it. Hold it.

56:16.763 --> 56:21.668
¶ so, let's go down
and join the union ¶

56:21.736 --> 56:25.039
Hey, look...look out!
Get out of the way!

56:26.276 --> 56:28.410
Go back that way.
Go on, now!

56:28.479 --> 56:29.512
Abe, no!

56:34.054 --> 56:35.520
Now, what you're doing
is illegal.

56:47.239 --> 56:48.705
Come on!

57:46.717 --> 57:49.486
What the hell's the matter
with you guys?

57:51.525 --> 57:52.757
Come on.

58:22.016 --> 58:23.516
Johnny, they're
burning the tent.

58:23.518 --> 58:24.719
It's on fire!

58:26.288 --> 58:27.823
Damn you, Talbot!

58:27.891 --> 58:29.892
You and your lousy scabs!

58:37.372 --> 58:38.404
No.

58:38.473 --> 58:39.639
Johnny!

58:39.708 --> 58:41.274
Let's go. Move.

58:45.416 --> 58:47.250
You goddamn bastards!

58:48.920 --> 58:52.424
You goddamn bastards!
Get out of the way!

58:52.893 --> 58:54.359
Anna!

58:54.428 --> 58:57.063
Get out of the way,
you damn butchers!

58:57.633 --> 58:59.466
Mike.

58:59.535 --> 59:02.237
Butchers!
Damn you to hell, Talbot.

59:02.306 --> 59:03.672
Mike!

59:06.445 --> 59:07.812
Oh, Christ!

59:25.639 --> 59:28.340
Did I... did I...

59:28.409 --> 59:30.644
Did I do this?
This is my fault.

59:30.712 --> 59:32.078
This is my fault.

59:32.147 --> 59:33.380
I know it's my fault.

59:33.450 --> 59:34.782
No, no.

01:01:01.572 --> 01:01:04.039
You know, Monahan
and my old man,

01:01:04.108 --> 01:01:06.810
they used to tie one
on at Cassidy's

01:01:06.879 --> 01:01:08.346
every Saturday.

01:01:11.018 --> 01:01:12.552
"Whistlin' past
the graveyard,"

01:01:12.621 --> 01:01:14.521
isn't that
what I said?

01:01:16.993 --> 01:01:19.327
We're all in it now,
Vince.

01:01:19.396 --> 01:01:22.399
It's got nothin'
to do with me.

01:01:22.468 --> 01:01:23.901
Yeah,
what's in it for you?

01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:26.070
Yeah, that's right.
What's in it for me?

01:01:26.139 --> 01:01:27.339
Now, let me ask you
something.

01:01:27.408 --> 01:01:29.174
What the hell is in it
for you?

01:01:29.243 --> 01:01:30.978
Get off it, Johnny.

01:01:33.817 --> 01:01:36.785
People buried
our people.

01:01:36.854 --> 01:01:39.055
My people
is anybody who pays.

01:01:39.691 --> 01:01:41.726
Our people.

01:01:41.794 --> 01:01:44.329
Look, Johnny, what you need
is real push.

01:01:44.398 --> 01:01:46.465
Real push is what I got.

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:53.743
I need it now.

01:01:58.018 --> 01:02:00.117
Well,
that's gonna cost you.

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:04.190
We got a fund.

01:02:08.231 --> 01:02:09.598
Well,

01:02:09.667 --> 01:02:11.534
I'll see
what I can do.

01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:12.669
Ok.

01:02:13.606 --> 01:02:14.772
Thanks.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.341
It's about time
you wised up.

01:02:17.410 --> 01:02:18.578
I'll see you, kid.

01:02:18.646 --> 01:02:19.879
Goodbye.

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:31.062
Don't do it, Johnny.

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:33.665
You wanna keep
burying people?

01:02:33.734 --> 01:02:35.500
You bring Vince
and his crowd in,

01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:37.236
I'm telling you, they're gonna
screw up this union.

01:02:37.305 --> 01:02:38.571
They ain't gonna
be in it for life.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.474
Johnny, Vince comes in,
he'll never get out.

01:02:40.542 --> 01:02:41.476
We need help, Abe.

01:02:41.544 --> 01:02:42.744
Without it
we ain't got a union.

01:02:42.813 --> 01:02:43.779
We can do it.

01:02:43.848 --> 01:02:46.215
We need push.

01:02:46.283 --> 01:02:47.818
Then how we gonna know...
know what?

01:02:47.886 --> 01:02:49.220
The difference.

01:02:49.288 --> 01:02:50.888
What difference?

01:02:52.192 --> 01:02:53.726
Between them and us.

01:02:53.794 --> 01:02:55.829
<i>All right now,
listen to me.</i>

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:57.197
We've got a lot
of trouble here.

01:02:57.266 --> 01:02:58.966
I'm gonna
straighten things out.

01:02:59.035 --> 01:03:00.435
Hi, Johnny.
Good to see you.

01:03:00.504 --> 01:03:01.738
You know Vince.

01:03:01.806 --> 01:03:03.472
Long time, Abe.
How you doing, Vince?

01:03:03.541 --> 01:03:05.609
Graham's here and he's talkin'
against the strike.

01:03:05.678 --> 01:03:06.610
Let me talk to him.

01:03:06.679 --> 01:03:07.846
What's the next...

01:03:07.914 --> 01:03:09.247
What the hell's
going to happen next?

01:03:09.316 --> 01:03:10.750
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

01:03:10.818 --> 01:03:12.653
Johnny, I want my job.

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:19.227
What are you going to tell
these men now, Kovak?

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:21.197
I'm glad you came down,
Max.

01:03:21.266 --> 01:03:22.900
Talbot's gonna
meet with me tomorrow.

01:03:22.969 --> 01:03:24.234
Yeah.

01:03:24.303 --> 01:03:26.304
You took these men out,
I'm gettin' their jobs back.

01:03:26.373 --> 01:03:28.174
Let's go someplace
where we can talk, man.

01:03:28.242 --> 01:03:29.710
I need your help
with something, Max.

01:03:29.779 --> 01:03:31.611
Yeah, I bet you do.
Come on.

01:03:31.681 --> 01:03:33.414
I'll see you men
in a couple of minutes.

01:03:33.483 --> 01:03:34.515
We'll be back.

01:03:34.584 --> 01:03:36.085
You should have
asked for my help

01:03:36.154 --> 01:03:38.321
before you started
all this, instead of your grandstanding.

01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:40.892
You're right, Max.
I can't argue about that.

01:03:42.997 --> 01:03:46.299
Come on, guys.
Come on, break it up now!

01:03:52.475 --> 01:03:54.243
What's on your mind?

01:03:55.614 --> 01:03:56.580
What is this?

01:03:56.648 --> 01:03:58.049
Get the door.

01:03:58.118 --> 01:03:59.584
What is this?

01:04:00.788 --> 01:04:02.387
Gonna see
Talbot?

01:04:04.326 --> 01:04:06.928
That's right,
Kovak.

01:04:06.996 --> 01:04:08.864
You're gonna sell us out,
Max, aren't you?

01:04:08.933 --> 01:04:11.601
Make us go back for nothing.
Aren't you?

01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:15.405
I don't have
to talk to you.

01:04:15.474 --> 01:04:17.175
I don't have to tell you
anything.

01:04:17.244 --> 01:04:19.311
I discuss this
with the men.

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:20.546
Train leaves
in an hour.

01:04:20.616 --> 01:04:22.649
You're going back
to Indianapolis.

01:04:23.854 --> 01:04:27.189
Like hell I am!
You crazy?

01:04:27.258 --> 01:04:29.126
I'm the president
of this union.

01:04:29.194 --> 01:04:30.460
No, Max,

01:04:31.197 --> 01:04:32.630
you're a salesman.

01:04:32.698 --> 01:04:33.966
You're gonna
sell us out.

01:04:34.034 --> 01:04:36.002
You son of a bitch.
You're gonna sell us out.

01:04:36.071 --> 01:04:37.237
Make us go back for nothin'.

01:04:37.305 --> 01:04:38.404
But I'm telling you
somethin'.

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:40.007
This is our fight.
Our strike.

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:41.476
This is our local.

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:43.211
It belongs to us.

01:04:44.182 --> 01:04:45.815
You're out of it.

01:04:52.894 --> 01:04:56.129
All right,
you do it your way.

01:04:57.566 --> 01:04:59.467
You wanna stand alone?

01:05:01.005 --> 01:05:03.339
I'll see you
at the next funeral.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.346
Let's go.

01:05:10.952 --> 01:05:12.886
Settle down!

01:05:12.955 --> 01:05:16.357
You guys without any seats,
stand along the sides.

01:05:18.429 --> 01:05:19.930
You guys got seats?
Sit down,

01:05:19.998 --> 01:05:21.597
and we can get
out of this sweatbox.

01:05:21.666 --> 01:05:23.467
Order!

01:05:23.536 --> 01:05:24.903
Thank you.

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.774
I just want to say
before we get started

01:05:28.844 --> 01:05:31.011
that Max Graham got called back
to Indianapolis

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.914
on account of
sudden union business.

01:05:32.983 --> 01:05:36.285
But he wanted me to tell you
that he's with us 200%.

01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:39.924
Wait a minute.

01:05:39.993 --> 01:05:42.527
And will help us
in any way he can.

01:05:42.596 --> 01:05:44.429
All right?

01:05:44.498 --> 01:05:46.733
Now, Abe here has a Western Union
he wants to read.

01:05:46.801 --> 01:05:47.869
Abe.

01:05:51.041 --> 01:05:52.942
It says:

01:05:53.011 --> 01:05:54.878
"To our brothers
in local 302

01:05:54.947 --> 01:05:57.782
"of the Federation
of Interstate Truckers.

01:05:57.851 --> 01:06:00.652
"We stand behind you
with our hearts and bodies

01:06:00.721 --> 01:06:04.224
"in the great and noble struggle
you must continue.

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:08.563
Together, the American labor movement
will never be vanquished."

01:06:16.576 --> 01:06:18.544
And it's signed,

01:06:18.613 --> 01:06:21.681
"yours in solidarity,
John I. Lewis committee..."

01:06:31.131 --> 01:06:34.065
We also got word from Petey Marr
of the dockworkers.

01:06:34.135 --> 01:06:35.501
He said that
whatever we need

01:06:35.569 --> 01:06:37.604
out of their emergency fund
to tide us over,

01:06:37.672 --> 01:06:38.839
we got it.

01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:43.412
Till we rightfully get
what's comin' to us.

01:06:45.783 --> 01:06:48.520
All right.
I just want to say one thing.

01:06:51.592 --> 01:06:53.860
We're to go back out there.

01:06:53.928 --> 01:06:57.431
They're not gonna
beat us down no more.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.135
They're not gonna
burn us down no more.

01:07:01.473 --> 01:07:04.308
They're not gonna
shoot us down no more.

01:07:04.377 --> 01:07:07.612
'Cause if they do,
we're gonna do what Mike did.

01:07:07.681 --> 01:07:09.682
We're comin' at 'em
with everything we got.

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:11.116
Yeah, that's right.

01:07:11.186 --> 01:07:12.919
And I'm saying
to consolidated right now...

01:07:12.988 --> 01:07:14.322
Yeah.

01:07:14.391 --> 01:07:17.426
We got to do any more buryin'
in the graveyard,

01:07:17.495 --> 01:07:19.729
they'd better
get out their shovels,

01:07:19.798 --> 01:07:21.899
'cause we're through
takin' punches.

01:07:23.503 --> 01:07:25.637
You don't win a fight
takin' a punch.

01:07:26.941 --> 01:07:29.577
Nobody ever won a fight
takin' a punch!

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:32.380
And you see what this says?

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:34.917
This ain't a bunch of letters
like any other union.

01:07:34.985 --> 01:07:36.853
It says "FIST."

01:07:36.922 --> 01:07:38.689
And that's what we are.

01:07:38.757 --> 01:07:41.092
Every guy in here. A FIST.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.761
One FIST.

01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:45.031
One FIST.

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.399
One FIST.

01:07:46.468 --> 01:07:47.935
- What are you?
- FIST!

01:07:48.003 --> 01:07:49.638
- What are you?
- FIST!

01:07:49.707 --> 01:07:53.209
FIST! FIST! FIST!

01:07:55.748 --> 01:07:57.982
FIST, FIST, FIST!

01:08:19.514 --> 01:08:20.714
- All right.
- All right.

01:08:20.783 --> 01:08:23.117
Ok, kid,
go ride your bike.

01:08:23.185 --> 01:08:26.020
Vinnie,
a consolidated truck.

01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:27.523
Just goin' over the bridge.

01:08:27.591 --> 01:08:30.828
Ok. Al, lefty, lard,
go pay 'em a call.

01:08:32.933 --> 01:08:35.602
Don't overdo it. Yeah.

01:08:35.671 --> 01:08:39.307
Yeah. Ok. Thank you.
We got another one.

01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:41.443
All right. Just left
terminal warehouse.

01:08:41.511 --> 01:08:43.546
You and chuck
go get them.

01:08:52.627 --> 01:08:54.194
Hey, you guys. Take it easy.

01:08:56.599 --> 01:08:59.535
All right, fellows, keep those guys back there.
Keep them back.

01:08:59.603 --> 01:09:02.372
All right, a lot of space between them, boys.
All right?

01:09:02.441 --> 01:09:05.309
Hey, scabs!

01:09:05.377 --> 01:09:07.212
Scabs, scabs.

01:09:08.616 --> 01:09:10.582
- What are we? FIST.
- FIST!

01:09:10.652 --> 01:09:11.917
- What are we?
- FIST!

01:09:11.987 --> 01:09:13.286
- What are we?
- FIST!

01:09:13.356 --> 01:09:14.622
- What are we?
- FIST!

01:09:14.691 --> 01:09:17.727
Hiya, hank.
How's the wife and kids?

01:09:17.795 --> 01:09:19.295
FIST! FIST!

01:09:19.365 --> 01:09:22.066
- What are we? What are we?
- FIST!

01:09:22.134 --> 01:09:24.269
FIST! FIST!

01:09:25.205 --> 01:09:26.973
Car 47 to Cleveland P.D.

01:09:27.041 --> 01:09:29.542
Need assistance at front gate consolidated.
Over.

01:09:51.742 --> 01:09:53.542
Hold it. Hold it.

01:09:56.916 --> 01:09:58.550
Anything wrong?

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:23.184
Hey, Vince,

01:10:23.253 --> 01:10:24.419
Here they come!

01:10:27.091 --> 01:10:29.493
Here they come.
Hey, here they come.

01:10:33.334 --> 01:10:35.535
All right, come on, fellows.
Let's go.

01:10:40.478 --> 01:10:41.610
Johnny.

01:10:47.186 --> 01:10:48.286
It's time.

01:10:49.957 --> 01:10:51.256
It's time!

01:11:30.747 --> 01:11:32.480
Now, slow down.

01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:33.682
Hold it here.

01:11:35.186 --> 01:11:37.655
Come on.

01:12:05.862 --> 01:12:07.362
Come on.

01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:37.403
Jocko, Billy! Let's go!

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:49.655
Get that son of a bitch!
Get him!

01:12:53.395 --> 01:12:54.494
Fire!

01:13:22.869 --> 01:13:24.537
Come on!

01:13:26.474 --> 01:13:28.174
Get them back,
come on, get them back.

01:13:58.385 --> 01:13:59.452
Johnny!

01:14:00.589 --> 01:14:01.889
Johnny.

01:14:05.161 --> 01:14:06.527
Hey, scab.

01:14:12.973 --> 01:14:14.940
Johnny!

01:14:15.009 --> 01:14:17.811
Johnny, stop it.
Stop it, you're killing him.

01:14:19.347 --> 01:14:20.948
Get on out of here. Get on!

01:14:33.268 --> 01:14:35.202
Insurance, pay hike,
overtime.

01:14:35.271 --> 01:14:37.005
It's all there, gentlemen.

01:14:40.578 --> 01:14:44.214
You said before you were concerned
about the men's welfare.

01:14:44.283 --> 01:14:46.418
Well, now we're satisfied.

01:14:52.996 --> 01:14:54.095
Thank you.

01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:57.334
Then it's a deal?

01:15:00.906 --> 01:15:02.441
- Johnny.
- Abe.

01:15:02.509 --> 01:15:03.675
Congratulations, kid.

01:15:03.743 --> 01:15:04.844
Thanks a lot, Vince.

01:15:04.912 --> 01:15:06.446
Um.

01:15:06.514 --> 01:15:09.884
I hope we can work together better
in the future, Mr. Kovak.

01:15:10.354 --> 01:15:11.586
Bank on it.

01:15:12.089 --> 01:15:14.090
Ok.

01:15:14.158 --> 01:15:17.561
We're on 68. Anytime now
it should change to 27,

01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:20.132
outside of Lexington.

01:15:20.201 --> 01:15:22.234
With the power
our union can bring you,

01:15:22.303 --> 01:15:24.804
you won't be called
garbage men anymore.

01:15:24.873 --> 01:15:28.576
You'll be called
valuable sanitation workers.

01:15:28.645 --> 01:15:30.078
There's a difference.

01:15:30.147 --> 01:15:33.583
You're men of Lexington,
you don't need Lexington.

01:15:33.652 --> 01:15:36.321
Lexington needs you.
Do you get my meaning?

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:38.824
Lexington needs you.

01:15:38.893 --> 01:15:42.595
Are you tired of having
somebody you never see

01:15:42.664 --> 01:15:45.299
telling you
you can't have no overtime?

01:15:47.371 --> 01:15:50.206
Tired of having somebody
you never see telling you

01:15:50.275 --> 01:15:53.111
you can't have no insurance
for your families?

01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:55.180
Tired of having
somebody you never see

01:15:55.249 --> 01:15:57.983
telling you you can't have any clothes
on your kids' backs.

01:15:58.053 --> 01:16:01.156
Well, if you're tired of hearing it,
you men from Dubuque,

01:16:01.224 --> 01:16:03.725
join with your brothers
from all over the state.

01:16:03.794 --> 01:16:07.531
And join with your brothers from Michigan,
from Indiana, from Kentucky

01:16:07.599 --> 01:16:09.100
and the whole Midwest.

01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:10.801
And for the first time,

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:14.274
this union is gonna give you something
to say about your own lives.

01:16:14.342 --> 01:16:17.178
<i>Everything on wheels
is gonna belong to us.</i>

01:16:17.246 --> 01:16:21.150
<i>There's gonna be a day
when this union is so powerful</i>

01:16:21.219 --> 01:16:22.885
<i>they're gonna shake.</i>

01:16:22.954 --> 01:16:24.654
<i>I, Abe Belkin,</i>

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.625
pledge my honor.

01:16:27.694 --> 01:16:29.128
Pledge my honor.

01:16:29.197 --> 01:16:31.097
To obey all
the laws of this union.

01:16:31.165 --> 01:16:33.200
<i>To obey all
the laws of this union.</i>

01:16:33.268 --> 01:16:34.902
<i>Pledge my
complete loyalty to it</i>

01:16:34.971 --> 01:16:36.605
<i>above all
other organizations.</i>

01:16:36.673 --> 01:16:38.840
<i>Pledge my
complete loyalty to it</i>

01:16:38.909 --> 01:16:40.810
<i>above all
other organizations.</i>

01:16:44.551 --> 01:16:46.284
I wonder when we'll hear
from Petey Marr.

01:16:46.353 --> 01:16:48.421
I don't know. I don't know.
I haven't heard anything.

01:16:48.490 --> 01:16:49.856
Good morning, boys.

01:16:49.925 --> 01:16:51.291
Good morning, Vince.
What've you got there?

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.727
146 business agents,
12 states in the Midwest.

01:16:52.795 --> 01:16:54.363
Oh, that's good.

01:16:54.432 --> 01:16:56.232
And, uh, here's a little wire for you
from Graham.

01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:58.602
Max Graham. Some president.
Is it collect? Here, read this.

01:16:58.670 --> 01:16:59.670
Good morning,
everyone.

01:16:59.739 --> 01:17:01.005
Good morning, Abe.

01:17:01.073 --> 01:17:02.807
We've got almost
100% company sign-ups.

01:17:02.876 --> 01:17:04.511
- Uh-huh. Almost.
- Who's giving us trouble?

01:17:04.579 --> 01:17:06.746
One outfit in Chicago.

01:17:06.814 --> 01:17:09.183
Some guy named
Vasko runs it.

01:17:09.252 --> 01:17:11.219
Another hard-headed hunky.

01:17:13.658 --> 01:17:15.526
- Vasko, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:17:15.594 --> 01:17:16.793
Why won't he sign?

01:17:16.862 --> 01:17:19.164
I don't know. His guys don't
wanna join up, he says.

01:17:19.232 --> 01:17:20.866
We got to do
something, Johnny.

01:17:20.934 --> 01:17:22.869
Johnny, the guy's a nobody.
We don't wanna muscle guys to sign up.

01:17:22.937 --> 01:17:25.139
That's where you're wrong, Abe.
They all got to join up.

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:27.876
It's for their own good. You know that.
Give Chicago local a call.

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:29.478
Find out more
about this Vasko. Ok?

01:17:29.547 --> 01:17:30.613
Sure, Johnny.

01:17:35.722 --> 01:17:37.155
Hey, let me handle it.

01:17:37.224 --> 01:17:38.957
Ok?

01:17:40.929 --> 01:17:42.730
<i>¶ Santa Claus
is coming to town ¶</i>

01:17:42.799 --> 01:17:44.199
<i>¶ gather round ¶</i>

01:17:44.267 --> 01:17:46.235
<i>¶ he's making a list ¶</i>

01:17:46.304 --> 01:17:47.570
Looking good,
isn't it?

01:17:47.638 --> 01:17:48.938
Huh, good.

01:17:49.007 --> 01:17:50.641
Who's that?

01:17:52.144 --> 01:17:54.846
<i>¶ Santa Claus
is coming to town ¶</i>

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:56.849
Frank Vasko?

01:17:56.918 --> 01:17:57.883
Yeah.

01:17:57.952 --> 01:17:59.886
Johnny Kovak,
from the union.

01:18:00.757 --> 01:18:02.390
Mrs. Vasko,
I'm John Kovak.

01:18:02.459 --> 01:18:03.792
How are you?

01:18:03.861 --> 01:18:05.261
Good evening.
- Helen.

01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:06.697
Take Aggie
upstairs awhile.

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:08.064
I want to finish the tree.

01:18:08.133 --> 01:18:10.736
Oh, she don't have to go no place on
account of me, Frank.

01:18:12.206 --> 01:18:13.673
Merry Christmas, Aggie.

01:18:13.742 --> 01:18:16.344
<i>¶ Santa Claus
is coming to town ¶</i>

01:18:16.412 --> 01:18:18.346
That angel
you have on the tree,

01:18:18.415 --> 01:18:21.284
that's the same angel
we have back at home. Exactly the same.

01:18:21.353 --> 01:18:23.386
My mother puts it
up there every year.

01:18:23.455 --> 01:18:25.689
Wouldn't seem like
Christmas without it.

01:18:25.758 --> 01:18:27.992
<i>¶ Santa Claus
is coming to town ¶</i>

01:18:31.767 --> 01:18:34.034
What the hell
you come here for?

01:18:34.103 --> 01:18:35.903
You can't scare me.

01:18:39.711 --> 01:18:43.481
Those...those business agents
you sent down,

01:18:43.549 --> 01:18:45.917
I had to put one of them
through a plate-glass window.

01:18:45.986 --> 01:18:48.688
Well, you're a rough guy, Frank.
Anyone can see that.

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:50.291
But you got to
understand something.

01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:51.760
This ain't
nothing personal.

01:18:51.828 --> 01:18:53.528
And what the hell,
our folks probably come over

01:18:53.597 --> 01:18:55.364
on the same boat together.
Am I right?

01:18:58.270 --> 01:18:59.970
Then what are we
arguing for?

01:19:00.039 --> 01:19:02.308
They don't wanna
sign up, Johnny.

01:19:02.376 --> 01:19:04.344
They took a vote.

01:19:04.413 --> 01:19:06.980
They don't wanna pay dues.

01:19:07.049 --> 01:19:08.882
Look, we got our
own insurance.

01:19:08.951 --> 01:19:11.620
I mean, my guys, they got the best
overtime in Chicago.

01:19:11.689 --> 01:19:13.856
They got the best rate of pay
of anybody in Illinois.

01:19:13.925 --> 01:19:15.426
What the hell they
want to sign up for?

01:19:15.494 --> 01:19:18.095
'Cause there are a lot of other guys
with other companies,

01:19:18.164 --> 01:19:19.331
you see,
that ain't got it so good.

01:19:23.171 --> 01:19:26.641
We got to think about all the guys
out there on the road, Frank.

01:19:26.710 --> 01:19:29.010
We got to have them
all sign up. Everybody.

01:19:29.079 --> 01:19:30.680
Everybody doesn't
live like this.

01:19:30.749 --> 01:19:32.850
We got to bring them
all together, Frank.

01:19:32.918 --> 01:19:35.019
So as we got the push.
Look!

01:19:35.088 --> 01:19:38.758
I'm not gonna force my men
to do something they don't wanna do.

01:19:48.574 --> 01:19:50.608
We can't make
no exceptions, Frank.

01:19:59.555 --> 01:20:01.322
Merry Christmas.

01:20:09.235 --> 01:20:11.771
That's it. Now don't burn
yourself, Mishka.

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:15.241
What have we got here?

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:17.679
Oh, beautiful. Look at that.

01:20:19.349 --> 01:20:20.583
Your presents.
That's for you.

01:20:20.651 --> 01:20:21.818
Here, Mishka,
I'll help you.

01:20:21.887 --> 01:20:23.253
Now, wait a minute.

01:20:23.322 --> 01:20:25.389
Come on, everybody,
the duck is ready.

01:20:26.794 --> 01:20:28.226
The duck's ready.

01:20:29.530 --> 01:20:30.730
Thank you.

01:20:30.799 --> 01:20:32.032
Open yours.

01:20:32.101 --> 01:20:33.468
What, I got one?
Yes.

01:20:33.536 --> 01:20:35.169
Get out of here. What did you get me?
Yes, yes, yes.

01:20:35.238 --> 01:20:37.206
Which hand?
That one.

01:20:39.277 --> 01:20:41.011
Merry Christmas, Anna.

01:20:49.291 --> 01:20:50.958
Oh.
- Yes or no?

01:20:51.027 --> 01:20:53.495
Oh, listen to him
giving the orders again.

01:20:54.332 --> 01:20:55.598
Yes or no?

01:20:55.667 --> 01:20:58.435
Oh, it's...it's not supposed to happen
like this, in here.

01:20:59.806 --> 01:21:02.307
Try it on.
No this...

01:21:02.376 --> 01:21:04.077
Oh, this one.

01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:06.614
Johnny.

01:21:06.683 --> 01:21:08.249
This one.

01:21:08.317 --> 01:21:09.518
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:21:15.928 --> 01:21:17.729
Where are they?

01:21:22.071 --> 01:21:23.737
Let's go tell them.

01:21:23.806 --> 01:21:26.407
No, let's just
wait a minute.

01:21:30.448 --> 01:21:31.848
- Ok?
- All right.

01:21:33.452 --> 01:21:34.953
Oh, Anna.

01:21:35.022 --> 01:21:36.989
I'm gonna give it to you.

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:38.992
Merry Christmas.

01:21:45.170 --> 01:21:46.736
How's the club doing?

01:21:46.805 --> 01:21:47.871
Oh, fine.

01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:50.141
Jocko's running it
for me while I'm away.

01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:52.210
You gotta come by
sometime, you know?

01:21:52.278 --> 01:21:54.013
I haven't seen you
in a long time.

01:21:54.082 --> 01:21:56.983
Very difficult
for me to get away.

01:21:57.052 --> 01:21:58.920
Big operation
going on here.

01:21:58.988 --> 01:22:00.889
Big business,
Vincent.

01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:02.424
Oh, listen, listen,

01:22:02.492 --> 01:22:04.694
since the last time
we spoke,

01:22:04.763 --> 01:22:06.230
uh, my wife had a baby.

01:22:06.298 --> 01:22:07.431
No kidding!

01:22:07.499 --> 01:22:09.267
Look at that,
look at that kid.

01:22:09.336 --> 01:22:11.070
- Oh, Jesus.
- Is that beautiful, huh?

01:22:11.139 --> 01:22:13.006
Oh, Johnny.

01:22:13.075 --> 01:22:15.744
Has the most beautiful hands
I ever saw on anybody.

01:22:15.812 --> 01:22:17.011
He looks
like you, Babe.

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.581
I should hope so.
I put a lot of work into it.

01:22:22.821 --> 01:22:25.590
Everybody wants
dessert, huh?

01:22:25.659 --> 01:22:29.062
Uh, fetch me a nice plate
of <i>Zeppole Di San Giuseppe.</i>

01:22:29.131 --> 01:22:30.765
<i>Zeppole di
San Giuseppe.</i>

01:22:31.734 --> 01:22:33.000
So, uh.

01:22:35.505 --> 01:22:36.906
How about it, Babe?

01:22:42.415 --> 01:22:46.052
Look, uh, what, you want me
to talk to this guy? What's his name?

01:22:46.121 --> 01:22:47.254
Vasko.

01:22:47.322 --> 01:22:48.555
Vasko? I'll talk to him.

01:22:48.624 --> 01:22:49.824
For your friend here.

01:22:49.893 --> 01:22:51.459
Well, Johnny and I figured,
you know,

01:22:51.528 --> 01:22:52.761
this being Chicago
and everything,

01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:54.097
it'd be better
if you took care of it.

01:22:54.166 --> 01:22:55.498
Sure, sure.

01:22:55.566 --> 01:22:56.733
Home team.

01:22:56.803 --> 01:22:57.902
Just some talk.

01:23:01.475 --> 01:23:02.608
You owe me.

01:23:07.383 --> 01:23:09.819
He's gonna remember,
huh, Vince?

01:23:09.887 --> 01:23:12.189
Johnny don't forget.
He's 100%.

01:23:12.257 --> 01:23:16.227
100%, 100%. Nobody's 100%.

01:23:18.065 --> 01:23:19.265
Nobody.

01:23:21.569 --> 01:23:22.569
<i>Salud.</i>

01:23:29.882 --> 01:23:30.914
Yes?

01:23:30.983 --> 01:23:32.083
Mrs. Vasko?

01:23:32.152 --> 01:23:33.051
Yes.

01:23:33.119 --> 01:23:34.519
May we come in?

01:23:35.723 --> 01:23:36.922
What do you want?

01:23:36.992 --> 01:23:39.493
Let go. No, no!
No, God, no!

01:23:39.562 --> 01:23:40.661
Get up.

01:23:40.730 --> 01:23:42.965
No! God, no.

01:23:45.436 --> 01:23:49.240
Tell Frank, next time,
we ain't gonna stop.

01:23:53.882 --> 01:23:57.752
Mishka, don't you think you could start
halfway up, maybe?

01:23:57.821 --> 01:23:59.387
Yeah.

01:23:59.456 --> 01:24:02.225
And this is when
uncle Mishka steps back.

01:24:02.294 --> 01:24:03.494
I know,
I know, father.

01:24:03.562 --> 01:24:04.896
Goodbye, Mishka.

01:24:04.965 --> 01:24:07.466
You, I...I know since
you were in diapers.

01:24:07.535 --> 01:24:08.968
I'll see you at Zigi's.

01:24:09.036 --> 01:24:11.705
And, Johnny, move up
to that side of the bride.

01:24:13.009 --> 01:24:15.544
And follow their
steps to the altar.

01:24:28.931 --> 01:24:30.565
We got to be there
by 8:00.

01:24:30.634 --> 01:24:32.366
Why can't you pick it up
in the morning?

01:24:32.435 --> 01:24:34.436
It'll only take a minute.
I'll be right out.

01:24:34.505 --> 01:24:36.439
Yeah, yeah,
I've heard that before.

01:24:38.210 --> 01:24:40.412
It's...it's really very simple.

01:24:41.549 --> 01:24:43.983
We're not asking for much.

01:24:44.052 --> 01:24:46.954
Your drivers, they don't
deliver liquor to any bar

01:24:47.023 --> 01:24:51.293
unless that bar's got one of our company's
jukeboxes in it. That's all.

01:24:51.362 --> 01:24:53.229
How many boxes are
you talking about?

01:24:53.298 --> 01:24:54.631
How many?

01:24:56.736 --> 01:24:59.204
2,000, 3,000,
at least.

01:24:59.273 --> 01:25:01.708
Here, Michigan, Illinois.

01:25:05.014 --> 01:25:07.482
It sounds like I don't
have any choice in this.

01:25:07.551 --> 01:25:09.218
Oh, sure you do, Johnny.

01:25:09.287 --> 01:25:12.522
But Babe did help us out
with that Vasko situation.

01:25:12.592 --> 01:25:15.860
And we'll help your men,
the union in whatever way we can.

01:25:17.966 --> 01:25:20.333
I got a lot of
respect for you, John.

01:25:21.370 --> 01:25:23.070
Sure.

01:25:23.139 --> 01:25:25.607
All right then,
we got a deal.

01:25:28.647 --> 01:25:29.747
John?

01:25:31.785 --> 01:25:32.984
Yeah.

01:25:35.690 --> 01:25:37.558
Congratulations, John.

01:25:41.499 --> 01:25:42.631
Vince, we'll talk.

01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:43.732
Right.

01:25:43.801 --> 01:25:46.369
Oh, John, I understand
you're getting married.

01:25:46.438 --> 01:25:48.205
Oh, that's very nice.

01:25:48.274 --> 01:25:50.509
I'd like to give you
a wedding present.

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:51.911
I don't need nothing.

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:53.312
Need?

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:55.983
Now, who's talking
about need?

01:25:56.051 --> 01:25:58.687
You're becoming
an important man, John.

01:25:58.755 --> 01:26:01.290
You got to start
living in some style.

01:26:01.359 --> 01:26:03.760
Buy yourself a nice home.

01:26:03.829 --> 01:26:06.966
That's my gift to you
and your new bride.

01:26:07.034 --> 01:26:08.634
I said I don't
need nothing.

01:26:08.703 --> 01:26:10.904
Uh, Johnny, I think Babe's
just trying to show his appreciation...

01:26:10.973 --> 01:26:12.473
I know what he's
trying to do, Vince.

01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:15.511
That's all right.
Vince, it's all right.

01:26:15.579 --> 01:26:18.915
John, really, I was... I was
only trying to help you out. That's all.

01:26:18.984 --> 01:26:23.021
Now believe me,
from the bottom of my heart,

01:26:23.089 --> 01:26:25.324
I hope your
marriage is blessed.

01:26:25.393 --> 01:26:27.226
Like mine has been.

01:26:36.474 --> 01:26:37.608
To Anna.

01:26:43.985 --> 01:26:45.152
Smile.

01:27:22.305 --> 01:27:23.505
Swing it, Molly. Swing it.

01:27:23.574 --> 01:27:24.807
You're stepping on my feet.

01:27:24.875 --> 01:27:26.576
Swing it, swing it!

01:27:28.346 --> 01:27:30.748
Hey, Mishka,
give a guy a break, will you?

01:27:34.122 --> 01:27:35.788
You look very beautiful,
Anna.

01:27:35.857 --> 01:27:37.091
Thank you.

01:27:37.159 --> 01:27:38.458
Take good care of him.

01:27:38.527 --> 01:27:40.028
I plan to.

01:27:46.305 --> 01:27:47.939
I'm supposed
to stand around here

01:27:48.008 --> 01:27:51.678
and watch a bunch
of hunkies dancing with my wife.

01:27:51.747 --> 01:27:53.780
Nobody better have a cold.

01:27:53.849 --> 01:27:56.316
Come on,
I wanna talk to you.

01:27:56.385 --> 01:27:58.120
All right,
yeah, we'll talk.

01:28:02.561 --> 01:28:03.961
Come on, Mishka.

01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:05.764
Come on.
Dance, Mishka.

01:28:13.076 --> 01:28:15.678
Here it is.
No, no, no.

01:28:15.746 --> 01:28:16.946
What are you doing?

01:28:17.015 --> 01:28:18.581
Not here.
I'm looking for the wine.

01:28:18.650 --> 01:28:20.551
We got our own
wine downstairs.

01:28:20.619 --> 01:28:22.688
No. Where?
It's not in there.

01:28:22.756 --> 01:28:23.822
There it is.

01:28:23.891 --> 01:28:25.324
It belongs
to the priest.

01:28:25.393 --> 01:28:27.194
Oh, it belongs to God.

01:28:27.262 --> 01:28:30.865
I know. I've been around this place
a lot more than you have.

01:28:30.934 --> 01:28:33.468
Remember when ma
made me join up and be an altar boy?

01:28:33.537 --> 01:28:35.138
I used to come here
every morning

01:28:35.207 --> 01:28:36.840
and have a shot of
the priest's wine. Why?

01:28:36.909 --> 01:28:38.776
'Cause it's the best damn wine
the priest drinks,

01:28:38.845 --> 01:28:42.081
so I think it's good enough for me,
don't you think?

01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:44.818
Here's to you and Molly,
I toast you.

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:46.087
Now wait a minute.

01:28:46.155 --> 01:28:48.590
That frame of hers,
she must be wearing you out.

01:28:48.658 --> 01:28:50.193
Now don't get mad at me.

01:28:50.261 --> 01:28:51.828
You can tell me,
I'm a married man now.

01:28:51.896 --> 01:28:53.663
What'd you do,
Johnny?

01:28:53.733 --> 01:28:54.732
What?

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:56.267
Jesus, what did you do?

01:28:57.337 --> 01:28:58.670
I got married. I...

01:28:58.740 --> 01:28:59.972
You took, didn't you?

01:29:00.041 --> 01:29:01.474
What are you saying?
You took.

01:29:01.543 --> 01:29:03.010
I never took...

01:29:03.079 --> 01:29:04.645
I had to stop off at the office.
I heard you.

01:29:04.714 --> 01:29:06.782
You gonna buy yourself
a nice home as your wedding present?

01:29:06.851 --> 01:29:08.718
Oh, listen, I didn't...
no, you listen!

01:29:08.787 --> 01:29:11.055
You're gonna piss it
all away. Everything.

01:29:11.124 --> 01:29:12.991
Everything we built up.

01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:15.594
You and the punks you got working with you.
Pushing guys.

01:29:15.663 --> 01:29:17.163
Doing things
they don't wanna.

01:29:17.232 --> 01:29:19.066
Look, I didn't do nothing
except what's good for the guys.

01:29:19.135 --> 01:29:21.602
Jukeboxes. That's gonna be
good for the guys!

01:29:21.671 --> 01:29:23.139
Ain't gonna hurt nothing.

01:29:23.207 --> 01:29:24.606
You sold out, Johnny.
Don't say that.

01:29:24.675 --> 01:29:25.909
You sold out.
- Don't say that!

01:29:25.978 --> 01:29:27.677
We had something clean.

01:29:27.746 --> 01:29:29.513
Clean?

01:29:29.582 --> 01:29:32.818
Why don't you go out
on the street and tell me what's clean, Abe?

01:29:32.887 --> 01:29:34.921
Ain't nothing clean.

01:29:34.990 --> 01:29:36.323
Ain't nothing clean.

01:29:36.392 --> 01:29:37.624
But look what we
got the guys.

01:29:37.693 --> 01:29:39.527
We got them more money,
we got them insurance.

01:29:39.596 --> 01:29:41.397
Look, I don't like it
no more than you,

01:29:41.465 --> 01:29:44.835
but we'd have nothing,
without Doyle and Milano. And you know it.

01:29:44.904 --> 01:29:46.204
You know that.

01:29:55.018 --> 01:29:57.186
I'm leaving tomorrow
for the west coast.

01:29:57.254 --> 01:30:00.790
I talked to Graham.
He needs my help out there.

01:30:00.859 --> 01:30:03.560
All right, so when
are you coming back?

01:30:05.565 --> 01:30:09.001
No, we're moving out there.
Me and Molly.

01:30:18.283 --> 01:30:20.051
Oh, Christ, Abe. Come on.

01:30:21.087 --> 01:30:23.588
We're going big here.

01:30:23.657 --> 01:30:26.826
I need your help.
This is where you belong.

01:30:26.896 --> 01:30:29.464
I mean, you, me,

01:30:29.532 --> 01:30:33.336
we built this whole together, Abe,
you're like my brother.

01:30:33.404 --> 01:30:36.240
You're like my brother.

01:30:36.308 --> 01:30:39.277
You're the only guy.
I...I can't trust nobody.

01:30:40.681 --> 01:30:42.282
I'm telling you.

01:31:14.561 --> 01:31:17.397
<i>¶ he rocks in the treetop

Ah, Mr. Kovak,
welcome to Washington.

01:31:52.547 --> 01:31:54.715
I'm Peter Jacobs,
head of public relations.

01:31:54.784 --> 01:31:56.651
Guy with a hand. Nice hand you got there.
Thank you.

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.387
Bernie Marr, my assistant.
Mr. Marr, hello.

01:31:58.456 --> 01:32:00.190
Uh, Mr. Graham
is expecting you in his office.

01:32:00.258 --> 01:32:01.658
May I take your coat?

01:32:01.727 --> 01:32:02.860
Gladly.

01:32:04.031 --> 01:32:06.699
Johnny, great to see you.

01:32:06.767 --> 01:32:09.403
Hey, you got to tell me
how you keep looking this fit.

01:32:09.472 --> 01:32:11.906
Exercise, Max, exercise.
How you been?

01:32:11.975 --> 01:32:13.508
You know Bernie Marr,
my assistant?

01:32:13.576 --> 01:32:14.710
- Bern.
- Mr. Graham.

01:32:14.778 --> 01:32:16.312
You know Mike Quinn,
northeast council?

01:32:16.381 --> 01:32:17.514
Bob Wilson,
southeast council.

01:32:17.582 --> 01:32:18.882
Bob, how have
you been?

01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:20.284
Abe Belkin show up
from the west coast?

01:32:20.353 --> 01:32:23.455
No. He's in Frisco negotiating.
Can't make it.

01:32:23.524 --> 01:32:25.125
Nice setup,
huh, Johnny?

01:32:25.193 --> 01:32:26.292
Yeah, very nice.

01:32:26.361 --> 01:32:27.395
Hey, you want a drink?

01:32:27.463 --> 01:32:28.695
No, it's too early
for me, Max.

01:32:28.764 --> 01:32:30.732
Hey, uh, we got
a masseur downstairs.

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.735
You wanna freshen up a bit?

01:32:32.803 --> 01:32:34.505
Your own masseur?
Ain't that something, Bernie?

01:32:34.573 --> 01:32:36.106
It's impressive.

01:32:36.175 --> 01:32:37.542
I was just checking out
the place here, it's, uh...

01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:39.310
What is that, mahogany?

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:40.779
No, it's walnut.

01:32:40.848 --> 01:32:42.382
Walnut.
Good for the image.

01:32:42.451 --> 01:32:43.650
You know what
I mean, Johnny?

01:32:43.718 --> 01:32:45.153
I know what you mean.
Excuse me, gentlemen,

01:32:45.221 --> 01:32:46.620
the regional meeting's
about to begin.

01:32:46.689 --> 01:32:47.989
Ok, uh.

01:32:48.059 --> 01:32:49.425
How long you staying?

01:32:49.493 --> 01:32:51.361
I just got here, you want to know
when I'm leaving?

01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:53.064
No. It's just that after
the regional meeting,

01:32:53.132 --> 01:32:55.200
the secretary of labor
is holding a press reception.

01:32:55.269 --> 01:32:56.568
I wanna make sure
you're gonna be around.

01:32:58.606 --> 01:33:00.807
Senator, how are you?

01:33:00.876 --> 01:33:02.510
I'm fine. Thank you.

01:33:04.747 --> 01:33:06.615
Senator.

01:33:10.323 --> 01:33:13.058
The contracts you've gotten
for your men in the Midwest

01:33:13.127 --> 01:33:16.028
certainly earns you
the respect of the entire trucking industry.

01:33:16.098 --> 01:33:17.330
It's nice of you
to say so.

01:33:17.399 --> 01:33:19.467
What paper are you with?
<i>Washington Post.</i>

01:33:19.535 --> 01:33:21.336
Bernie, make sure we get
a subscription to <i>The Post,</i> all right?

01:33:21.405 --> 01:33:23.005
Tell me something, Mr. Kovak.
Yeah.

01:33:23.074 --> 01:33:25.909
How come you always manage
to get your men such good contracts?

01:33:25.978 --> 01:33:27.444
And what paper
are you with?

01:33:27.513 --> 01:33:28.813
- Johnny.
- Yeah?

01:33:28.881 --> 01:33:30.583
This is Senator Andrew Madison
of Pennsylvania.

01:33:30.651 --> 01:33:32.418
I see.

01:33:32.487 --> 01:33:34.287
He's the chairman of the senate
rackets committee.

01:33:34.356 --> 01:33:36.790
Is that right?
I thought it was a press reception.

01:33:36.859 --> 01:33:38.727
Well, labor has always been
an interest of mine.

01:33:38.795 --> 01:33:40.195
Is that so?
Are we on television?

01:33:40.264 --> 01:33:41.284
You gonna answer
the question?

01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:42.534
What question is that?

01:33:42.602 --> 01:33:44.569
Well, I was curious how come you were always
able to get your men

01:33:44.638 --> 01:33:46.672
such surprisingly
good contracts.

01:33:46.741 --> 01:33:48.975
Well, I learned something
a long time ago, Senator.

01:33:49.044 --> 01:33:52.514
You can get anything you want in this country
with a little bit of push.

01:33:53.784 --> 01:33:56.553
That's good.
Oh, that's good.

01:33:56.621 --> 01:34:00.124
Thank you, Mr. Kovak.
Excuse me.

01:34:00.193 --> 01:34:03.062
Mr. Kovak
really talks simple...

01:34:05.735 --> 01:34:07.735
What we gonna do about
this senate race here?

01:34:07.804 --> 01:34:09.404
I don't know
nothing about this guy,

01:34:09.473 --> 01:34:10.939
what the hell's
his name, Buford?

01:34:11.008 --> 01:34:12.475
- No, Belford.
- Belford.

01:34:12.543 --> 01:34:15.144
We've already got 3 letters
from judge Williams asking our support.

01:34:15.213 --> 01:34:16.714
Look, I know that, Vince.

01:34:16.783 --> 01:34:18.884
But the only time I met the guy
he shook hands like this.

01:34:18.952 --> 01:34:21.488
Like a fish.
He's gonna lose.

01:34:21.556 --> 01:34:22.722
Yeah, all right.

01:34:22.791 --> 01:34:24.258
So what do we
give him, 5?

01:34:24.326 --> 01:34:26.661
I wouldn't give him 5
if he was the last guy on earth.

01:34:26.730 --> 01:34:28.531
Give him 2 as a favor to the judge.
And Vince.

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:29.565
Yeah?

01:34:29.634 --> 01:34:30.834
You better get a receipt.

01:34:30.903 --> 01:34:33.003
Ok.

01:34:33.071 --> 01:34:35.407
Johnny, somebody here
to see you.

01:34:35.475 --> 01:34:38.779
I told you no more
appointments today, Bernie.

01:34:38.847 --> 01:34:40.346
That include
your best man?

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:44.686
Abe, how the hell
are you?

01:34:44.755 --> 01:34:45.821
How are you, Johnny?

01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:47.223
How are you?

01:34:47.292 --> 01:34:50.127
But when you spend
as much time shopping as I do,

01:34:50.195 --> 01:34:52.798
you just watch
the prices go up.

01:34:52.866 --> 01:34:54.467
May I leave the table,
please, mom?

01:34:54.536 --> 01:34:56.437
Yeah, when you finish your milk.
Yeah, finish it.

01:34:56.505 --> 01:34:57.971
Don't you want
some more ice cream, Mike?

01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.607
Let me give you
some coffee, Abe.

01:34:59.676 --> 01:35:01.175
Kids today!
People starving don't have that much.

01:35:01.244 --> 01:35:02.344
Mama, coffee?

01:35:02.413 --> 01:35:03.646
No, no, no.

01:35:03.714 --> 01:35:06.049
Uh, Abe, some cakes?

01:35:06.117 --> 01:35:09.855
Uh, no... All right, just a little piece.
It's very good.

01:35:09.924 --> 01:35:11.658
- Anna?
- Thank you, mama.

01:35:11.726 --> 01:35:14.294
You're right, Anna,
the price of living has gone up 5%.

01:35:14.363 --> 01:35:17.031
Well, I think when Johnny asks
for the national contract,

01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:19.368
he ought to ask for
at least 8% raise.

01:35:19.437 --> 01:35:21.203
You're going for
a national contract?

01:35:21.272 --> 01:35:22.739
I'm thinking about it.

01:35:22.808 --> 01:35:24.342
Oh, I think
it's a good idea.

01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:26.277
No, you don't
understand, Anna.

01:35:26.346 --> 01:35:29.147
To get 8%, you'd probably have to
sign a no-strike clause.

01:35:29.216 --> 01:35:31.685
Without that,
we got no leverage.

01:35:31.753 --> 01:35:33.454
Well, maybe you're right.

01:35:34.123 --> 01:35:35.423
Here's to old times.

01:35:35.493 --> 01:35:36.792
Good times.

01:35:36.861 --> 01:35:38.060
Wish Molly were here.

01:35:38.129 --> 01:35:39.663
Oh, she misses you all
and sends her love.

01:35:39.732 --> 01:35:41.131
Yeah.

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:44.603
So every couple of years you miss me,
you come back.

01:35:44.672 --> 01:35:46.338
What's on your mind?

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:47.808
Toys.

01:35:47.877 --> 01:35:48.976
Toys?

01:35:50.714 --> 01:35:52.882
You know that model truck
you got sitting on your desk?

01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:54.282
Sure.

01:35:54.351 --> 01:35:56.620
Every local
in the country's got one.

01:35:56.688 --> 01:35:58.422
$100 a piece.

01:35:58.491 --> 01:36:00.458
Over 1,000 locals
in the country.

01:36:00.528 --> 01:36:01.727
That's a lot of
money, Johnny.

01:36:01.795 --> 01:36:02.962
It is a lot of money.

01:36:03.031 --> 01:36:04.764
How come you bought one?

01:36:04.833 --> 01:36:06.500
My secretary got it.

01:36:06.569 --> 01:36:09.103
You got one the same reason
my local got one.

01:36:09.172 --> 01:36:12.642
'Cause we all got a letter from Max Graham
suggesting we get a couple.

01:36:12.711 --> 01:36:14.711
Mmm-hmm.

01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:17.649
You know who owns the company
made those toys, Johnny?

01:36:17.717 --> 01:36:19.284
No.

01:36:19.353 --> 01:36:20.720
Graham's wife.

01:36:23.259 --> 01:36:24.258
You sure?

01:36:24.326 --> 01:36:25.861
Oh, yeah.

01:36:25.930 --> 01:36:27.729
It's right out of
the guys' pockets.

01:36:27.798 --> 01:36:29.065
Wait a minute. You heard.

01:36:29.133 --> 01:36:30.332
You have any proof?

01:36:30.401 --> 01:36:31.735
Want me to forget about it?

01:36:31.804 --> 01:36:33.572
Did I say that?
Let me look into it.

01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:35.173
Then what?

01:36:35.241 --> 01:36:36.542
Well, if it checks out,
I'll do something about it.

01:36:36.611 --> 01:36:37.944
Like what?

01:36:38.012 --> 01:36:40.748
Hey, Abe, do you think
I'd let that bum get away

01:36:40.817 --> 01:36:42.951
with taking from
the guys, do you?

01:36:44.822 --> 01:36:47.457
Let me handle it. Ok?

01:36:51.398 --> 01:36:54.333
What did you and Abe
talk about?

01:36:54.402 --> 01:36:57.504
He thinks that Graham
is taking from the guys.

01:37:00.644 --> 01:37:01.777
Is he?

01:37:04.650 --> 01:37:06.417
He doesn't have
any proof.

01:37:13.294 --> 01:37:15.596
Wha-what are you
gonna do about it?

01:37:15.665 --> 01:37:17.633
I don't know.

01:37:17.701 --> 01:37:20.402
You know Abe, he's always
getting carried away.

01:37:31.086 --> 01:37:32.053
Johnny?

01:37:32.122 --> 01:37:33.220
Yeah?

01:37:35.893 --> 01:37:38.227
Maybe you'd
better check it out.

01:37:41.634 --> 01:37:44.503
I think I'll have
Bernie do that.

01:37:44.572 --> 01:37:47.141
But first, I'm gonna
check you out.

01:37:48.778 --> 01:37:51.112
Ah, oh, yeah,
I love you, girl.

01:37:54.753 --> 01:37:56.153
Strike! Yeah!

01:37:56.221 --> 01:37:57.221
All right!

01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:58.756
Lucky?

01:37:58.825 --> 01:38:00.292
All right,
you're up, Babe.

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:01.860
Oh, you're hot
tonight, kid.

01:38:01.929 --> 01:38:03.596
I've been
working on it.

01:38:03.665 --> 01:38:05.666
So, you had a nice time
in Washington, huh?

01:38:05.735 --> 01:38:07.034
It's still Washington.

01:38:07.103 --> 01:38:08.904
Hey, I saw you
on television.

01:38:08.972 --> 01:38:10.707
Everybody in Detroit's
talking about you.

01:38:10.775 --> 01:38:12.676
Yeah? What are
they saying about me?

01:38:12.745 --> 01:38:16.681
They wish they had you
up there, to keep an eye on Henry Ford.

01:38:22.424 --> 01:38:24.625
Strike.

01:38:24.694 --> 01:38:27.596
Ah, John, John,
how are the boys, huh?

01:38:27.664 --> 01:38:29.799
How's Mike
and, uh, Kevin?

01:38:29.868 --> 01:38:31.769
Uh, they're still growing,
still growing.

01:38:31.838 --> 01:38:33.571
Oh, that's nice.
That's very nice.

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:35.207
My boy, Anthony,
he's off to college.

01:38:35.275 --> 01:38:36.408
Yeah?

01:38:36.477 --> 01:38:37.777
West Point.

01:38:37.846 --> 01:38:39.479
- West Point?
- Yeah.

01:38:39.548 --> 01:38:41.249
Where do
the years go, huh?

01:38:41.317 --> 01:38:43.853
They just go.

01:38:43.921 --> 01:38:45.889
Oh, John, John,
my partners and I,

01:38:45.958 --> 01:38:47.924
we had a little
discussion, um.

01:38:47.993 --> 01:38:50.228
We, uh, need an extension
on that last loan.

01:38:50.296 --> 01:38:51.964
Well, that's
gonna be hard.

01:38:52.032 --> 01:38:54.901
Hard. Nobody said
life is easy.

01:38:57.406 --> 01:38:58.840
How much more?

01:38:58.909 --> 01:39:01.510
$2.5 million.

01:39:01.579 --> 01:39:03.546
Yeah.

01:39:03.615 --> 01:39:06.717
I don't think you have
that kind of collateral.

01:39:08.221 --> 01:39:11.792
We got years of
collateral, John. Years.

01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:13.895
You're up, Johnny.

01:39:13.963 --> 01:39:15.729
That's some manicure you got.

01:39:17.634 --> 01:39:18.968
Manicure?

01:39:20.038 --> 01:39:22.173
What's the matter
with a manicure?

01:39:22.241 --> 01:39:24.109
All these years, John.

01:39:24.178 --> 01:39:26.645
All these years and
you're still a hunky?

01:40:13.112 --> 01:40:14.478
There he is.

01:40:16.616 --> 01:40:18.217
How you been?

01:40:18.286 --> 01:40:21.355
Just between you and me...

01:40:24.394 --> 01:40:25.527
we'll take care of it.

01:40:42.585 --> 01:40:44.720
You were right about Graham.
It checked out.

01:40:44.789 --> 01:40:46.089
You got the proof?

01:40:46.158 --> 01:40:48.026
Well, Bernie's got
records showing that

01:40:48.094 --> 01:40:50.194
Graham's wife owned
that toy company in Oakland.

01:40:50.263 --> 01:40:52.464
That's misappropriation
of union funds.

01:40:52.533 --> 01:40:53.566
When this gets out...

01:40:53.635 --> 01:40:54.734
it's not gonna get out.

01:40:54.803 --> 01:40:56.304
What do you mean,
it's not gonna get out?

01:40:56.372 --> 01:40:57.939
Look, we don't need
any bad press.

01:40:58.007 --> 01:40:59.408
Well, what about Graham?

01:41:01.579 --> 01:41:03.213
Let me handle it.

01:41:04.050 --> 01:41:05.249
Let me handle it.

01:41:06.619 --> 01:41:08.387
We'll take care of 'em.

01:41:08.456 --> 01:41:10.089
We got a great team here.

01:41:12.094 --> 01:41:13.561
Johnny.

01:41:13.629 --> 01:41:16.898
Uh, uh, uh, talk to Eddie.
Come in! Come in.

01:41:16.968 --> 01:41:19.802
We'll, uh, finish
this up later, Karen.

01:41:19.871 --> 01:41:22.139
We're not interrupting
anything, are we, Max?

01:41:22.208 --> 01:41:23.240
It'll keep.

01:41:23.309 --> 01:41:24.676
How you doin', Max?
Vince.

01:41:24.744 --> 01:41:26.379
Good to see you.
How are you?

01:41:26.448 --> 01:41:28.214
Bernie.
Mr. Graham.

01:41:28.283 --> 01:41:29.850
- Johnny.
- How are you, Max?

01:41:29.918 --> 01:41:31.252
- You're looking good.
- Thanks.

01:41:31.321 --> 01:41:32.387
How about a drink?

01:41:32.456 --> 01:41:33.521
Not before noon.

01:41:35.926 --> 01:41:36.994
Bernie?

01:41:37.062 --> 01:41:38.228
No, thank you.

01:41:38.297 --> 01:41:39.697
Vince?

01:41:39.765 --> 01:41:40.965
No.

01:41:43.337 --> 01:41:44.570
Well,

01:41:46.709 --> 01:41:49.211
I'll have one.
Here's looking at you.

01:41:49.279 --> 01:41:51.179
You like
the ponies, Max?

01:41:51.248 --> 01:41:52.348
What?

01:41:52.417 --> 01:41:55.119
The track.
Do you like the track?

01:41:55.187 --> 01:41:57.255
What do you mean?

01:41:57.324 --> 01:42:01.060
Well, sometimes I see a race or 2, sure.
But, I, uh...

01:42:01.129 --> 01:42:03.730
You sure you
don't want a drink?

01:42:03.798 --> 01:42:06.534
Max, you own a horse
named Dancing Fancy?

01:42:07.271 --> 01:42:08.337
Yeah.

01:42:08.406 --> 01:42:10.540
You have a trainer
named Rafelli?

01:42:10.608 --> 01:42:12.309
Danny Rafelli.

01:42:12.378 --> 01:42:15.047
The trainer's on salary
as a business agent?

01:42:15.115 --> 01:42:17.216
He looks after our
interests at the track.

01:42:17.285 --> 01:42:19.552
You have a public relations firm
in Philadelphia?

01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:21.255
I'm a partner, yeah, yeah.

01:42:21.323 --> 01:42:25.027
John Gottlieb and associates,
that you paid $75,000 to last year?

01:42:25.096 --> 01:42:27.263
That's legitimate
union business.

01:42:27.332 --> 01:42:30.435
Most of that money was used on yourself
for personal effects.

01:42:30.503 --> 01:42:32.837
Now, wait a minute.
Sometimes they bought me a gift.

01:42:32.906 --> 01:42:34.974
"6 dozen undershirts,
8 television sets,

01:42:35.043 --> 01:42:36.309
these are business gifts.

01:42:36.378 --> 01:42:37.711
"Golf balls and clubs.

01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:40.915
Sheets and pillowcases,
30 pairs of nylons, 2 lawn mowers."

01:42:40.984 --> 01:42:43.319
What about that toy company
your wife has?

01:42:43.388 --> 01:42:45.088
What did you
make off that, Max?

01:42:46.592 --> 01:42:49.694
23 years ago, you said to me,
"you'd take, Kovak."

01:42:52.934 --> 01:42:55.403
You should've
never said that, Max.

01:43:02.247 --> 01:43:04.982
<i>When I was first elected
president of this union,</i>

01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:08.387
<i>we had 200,000 members.</i>

01:43:10.558 --> 01:43:11.825
<i>Today</i>

01:43:13.163 --> 01:43:15.130
<i>we're over 2 million.</i>

01:43:24.445 --> 01:43:28.749
<i>The past 20 years
have been the best years of my life.</i>

01:43:34.526 --> 01:43:37.727
<i>And so it's with a heavy heart</i>

01:43:39.332 --> 01:43:40.965
<i>that I tell you</i>

01:43:42.336 --> 01:43:46.173
<i>that because of medical
and family problems...</i>

01:43:48.110 --> 01:43:50.512
<i>I cannot stand
for another term.</i>

01:43:51.081 --> 01:43:52.982
No!

01:43:58.192 --> 01:44:01.327
<i>I place in nomination</i>

01:44:01.396 --> 01:44:04.932
<i>a man who has the respect
of every member,</i>

01:44:05.001 --> 01:44:09.205
<i>the head of our Midwest council
for many years,</i>

01:44:09.274 --> 01:44:13.544

01:45:09.190 --> 01:45:13.561
<i>I will get you the biggest pay hike

01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:32.821

<i>I promise you that.</i>

01:45:35.827 --> 01:45:37.894
Kovak! Kovak!

01:45:40.968 --> 01:45:44.304
FIST!

01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:55.820
<i>God bless you.</i>

floor as John D. Kovak</i>

01:46:36.378 --> 01:46:38.379

<i>Washington:

01:46:48.595 --> 01:46:52.533
Well, I'll tell you who's
a very happy man tonight: Babe Milano.

01:46:54.637 --> 01:46:56.638
You know,
I think we should check into Kovak.

01:46:56.706 --> 01:46:57.873
No, no, no.

01:46:59.043 --> 01:47:00.744
You keep working
on Milano.

01:47:00.813 --> 01:47:02.914
See what
you can dig up.

01:47:02.982 --> 01:47:06.184
And I'm going to stay
very close to Mr. Kovak.

01:47:12.963 --> 01:47:14.596
Do you have a car,
congressman?

01:47:14.665 --> 01:47:16.899
Car? I don't even have
a driver's license.

01:47:16.968 --> 01:47:20.303
Oh, that's too bad, you'll never get in
the union that way.

01:47:20.373 --> 01:47:23.476
Oh, well, we can always
go back to the farm, can't we?

01:47:26.114 --> 01:47:27.981
Hh, Senator, Senator.

01:47:28.050 --> 01:47:30.317
You, uh... Mr. Kovak,
you know Senator Madison, don't you?

01:47:30.386 --> 01:47:32.855
Sure, and what's the rackets committee up to
nowadays, Senator?

01:47:32.923 --> 01:47:36.426
Well, we've been busy
investigating "push" of various kinds.

01:47:36.496 --> 01:47:37.528
Oh, is that a fact?

01:47:37.597 --> 01:47:39.297
That's a fact.

01:47:39.366 --> 01:47:41.534
Well, "push" is something
that every politician, I'm sure, knows about.

01:47:41.603 --> 01:47:42.702
Oh, come on.

01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:44.371
Even the politicians
in the labor movement?

01:47:44.439 --> 01:47:46.273
I'm no politician,
Senator.

01:47:46.342 --> 01:47:48.275
That's right, you're not.

01:47:49.179 --> 01:47:50.412
Goodnight, Mr. Kovak.

01:47:50.481 --> 01:47:51.648
Goodnight, Senator.

01:47:52.651 --> 01:47:53.718
Oh, uh,

01:47:55.488 --> 01:47:57.389
give my regards
to Milano.

01:47:57.457 --> 01:47:58.858
You know him?

01:47:58.927 --> 01:48:01.294
Not as well as
you do, no.

01:48:03.232 --> 01:48:04.766
Johnny.

01:48:06.771 --> 01:48:08.771
Don't let him get to you.

01:48:08.841 --> 01:48:10.373
I don't plan on it.

01:48:12.245 --> 01:48:17.150
<i>Gentlemen, the cost of
living increase is 5.5%.</i>

01:48:18.587 --> 01:48:20.888
<i>You want 8% hike, Mr. Kovak?</i>

01:48:25.664 --> 01:48:27.197
<i>We'll go 7%.</i>

01:48:32.306 --> 01:48:34.441
<i>8%, the number is 8%.</i>

01:48:34.509 --> 01:48:36.476
<i>We will go 7% only.</i>

01:48:36.545 --> 01:48:38.479
<i>With a no-strike clause.</i>

01:48:43.154 --> 01:48:47.926
<i>And a flat guarantee
you'll settle all wildcats within 48 hours.</i>

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:54.534
<i>You want guarantees,
then you'll pay the price, won't you?</i>

01:48:54.604 --> 01:48:56.938
<i>The price is too high,
Mr. Kovak.</i>

01:49:00.779 --> 01:49:02.513
<i>So are your profits.</i>

01:49:09.825 --> 01:49:11.558
<i>All right, gentlemen,</i>

01:49:13.563 --> 01:49:17.033
<i>after much deliberation,
we're willing to go</i>

01:49:17.102 --> 01:49:21.840
<i>to a ceiling of 7.5%
across the board.</i>

01:49:23.044 --> 01:49:24.977
<i>We think that's
more than fair.</i>

01:49:27.049 --> 01:49:29.083
<i>Of course you do.</i>

01:49:29.152 --> 01:49:30.819
<i>But the number,
gentlemen, is 8%.</i>

01:49:30.888 --> 01:49:32.121
<i>7.5%.</i>

01:49:32.189 --> 01:49:33.256
<i>8%.</i>

01:49:33.324 --> 01:49:34.357
<i>7.5%.</i>

01:49:34.425 --> 01:49:35.626
<i>8%.</i>

01:49:37.196 --> 01:49:39.898
<i>Absolutely no way, Kovak.</i>

01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:01.696
<i>I thought you were
smart businessmen.</i>

01:50:01.764 --> 01:50:03.464
<i>But you're not.</i>

01:50:03.533 --> 01:50:05.300
<i>You have any idea
how much revenue</i>

01:50:05.368 --> 01:50:07.503
<i>you're gonna lose
on a national strike?</i>

01:50:11.578 --> 01:50:12.844
<i>They went to 7%.</i>

01:50:12.913 --> 01:50:14.046
No!

01:50:14.115 --> 01:50:15.114
<i>7.5%.</i>

01:50:15.183 --> 01:50:16.115
No!

01:50:16.184 --> 01:50:17.617
<i>But you wanted 8%!</i>

01:50:17.686 --> 01:50:19.286
Yes!

01:50:19.355 --> 01:50:20.955
<i>I got you 8%!</i>

01:50:33.742 --> 01:50:35.442
<i>I'm pleased that we're having</i>

01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:37.912
<i>this closed executive session,
gentlemen.</i>

01:50:37.981 --> 01:50:39.849
<i>Because I believe
that the rackets committee</i>

01:50:39.917 --> 01:50:44.154
<i>should expand its investigations
into another area.</i>

01:50:44.223 --> 01:50:47.559
<i>Now I say this with,
uh, some regret.</i>

01:50:47.628 --> 01:50:51.999
<i>I have long had respect
for the labor movement</i>

01:50:52.068 --> 01:50:56.437
<i>and its accomplishments,
but I find it frightening</i>

01:50:56.506 --> 01:51:01.078
<i>that the head of one
of the largest unions in this country</i>

01:51:01.147 --> 01:51:04.348
<i>may, I say "may,"
have ties to</i>

01:51:04.417 --> 01:51:07.052
<i>the bosses of
organized crime.</i>

01:51:07.121 --> 01:51:08.755
So how about it, John?

01:51:08.824 --> 01:51:10.792
Come on,
they can't prove anything.

01:51:10.860 --> 01:51:12.694
It's business, John.

01:51:12.763 --> 01:51:16.199
You make loans out of the pension fund
to all kinds of people.

01:51:16.268 --> 01:51:18.635
You're charging us
the same thing you charge everybody else.

01:51:18.704 --> 01:51:19.837
Nothing wrong with that.

01:51:19.906 --> 01:51:21.139
It's not smart.

01:51:21.208 --> 01:51:23.176
Madison's got subpoenas
in every local in the country.

01:51:23.244 --> 01:51:25.312
Madison, Madison...
Come on, will you?

01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:27.982
He'll grab a couple of headlines,
they'll fold the committee

01:51:28.051 --> 01:51:30.084
and move on to
something else.

01:51:30.154 --> 01:51:33.023
What do you say,
huh, John? Huh?

01:51:33.091 --> 01:51:35.526
Our Dun & Bradstreet
is the best.

01:51:42.503 --> 01:51:43.971
Call it a favor.

01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:46.074
When do these favors end?

01:51:49.547 --> 01:51:51.381
This is
the last favor, Babe.

01:52:12.146 --> 01:52:13.211
What do you want?

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:14.447
This is a subpoena,

01:52:14.516 --> 01:52:16.016
it requires you
to open all your files.

01:52:16.084 --> 01:52:18.418
You just tell me
what you want.

01:52:18.487 --> 01:52:20.888
I'll tell you what we want.

01:52:20.957 --> 01:52:25.061
We want a list of local 302's
financial assets from 1952.

01:52:25.130 --> 01:52:26.430
We don't have 'em.

01:52:28.201 --> 01:52:31.504
A list of banks
where those assets are deposited.

01:52:31.573 --> 01:52:32.972
We don't have 'em.

01:52:33.041 --> 01:52:36.411
Names and salaries
of Midwest council business agents.

01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:37.612
We don't have 'em.

01:52:37.681 --> 01:52:40.516
Records of local 302's
property investments.

01:52:40.585 --> 01:52:42.619
- "We don't have them."
- We don't have 'em.

01:52:42.688 --> 01:52:46.123
And what about, uh, 302's
political contributions?

01:52:46.193 --> 01:52:48.227
We don't have
those, either.

01:52:49.764 --> 01:52:51.331
What do you mean,
you don't have them?

01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:54.369
We had a burglary here last week,
they cleaned out the files.

01:52:54.438 --> 01:52:55.537
Ain't that right, Bernie?

01:52:55.606 --> 01:52:56.906
That's right, Vince.

01:52:56.974 --> 01:52:58.040
A burglary?

01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:59.410
Yeah.

01:52:59.478 --> 01:53:01.278
It's a real bad element moving
into this neighborhood.

01:53:01.347 --> 01:53:04.048
Robberies all over the place.

01:53:04.117 --> 01:53:06.785
Well, I assume that you
made out a police report.

01:53:06.854 --> 01:53:07.921
Did you, Vince?

01:53:07.989 --> 01:53:09.022
Absolutely.

01:53:10.227 --> 01:53:11.492
Anything show up yet?

01:53:11.561 --> 01:53:12.994
Oh, not so far, John.

01:53:13.063 --> 01:53:14.931
You give them a call,
make sure they're working on it.

01:53:14.999 --> 01:53:16.299
Sure thing.

01:53:16.368 --> 01:53:18.936
But, gentlemen,
I don't think you understand.

01:53:19.004 --> 01:53:22.609
That subpoena gives us the right
to go through your files.

01:53:29.185 --> 01:53:31.254
I want you to get
out of my office.

01:53:32.691 --> 01:53:34.992
I'll leave your office,
Mr. Kovak.

01:53:35.995 --> 01:53:38.597
But when I come
back next time,

01:53:38.666 --> 01:53:40.933
it'll be with
a federal marshal.

01:53:41.002 --> 01:53:43.371
Don't waste
the taxpayers' money, Senator,

01:53:43.439 --> 01:53:45.005
we have a clean outfit here.

01:53:45.074 --> 01:53:48.010
You wanna get a reputation?
Get it somewhere else.

01:53:48.079 --> 01:53:49.445
Let's go, Daley.

01:54:05.604 --> 01:54:07.136
We've got still
another problem.

01:54:07.205 --> 01:54:08.238
What?

01:54:08.308 --> 01:54:10.007
Abe's called
a wildcat strike.

01:54:10.075 --> 01:54:11.176
What?

01:54:11.244 --> 01:54:12.977
Yeah.

01:54:13.046 --> 01:54:14.614
He can't do that,
we've got a national contract.

01:54:14.683 --> 01:54:16.583
That son of a bitch.
What's he trying to do?

01:54:16.652 --> 01:54:18.820
He says he doesn't care
about any contract.

01:54:18.888 --> 01:54:20.254
<i>He's going out in 48 hours.</i>

01:55:01.849 --> 01:55:03.382
What's goin' on here?

01:55:03.450 --> 01:55:04.617
Abe Belkin?

01:55:04.686 --> 01:55:05.785
You know
who the hell I am.

01:55:05.854 --> 01:55:08.054
You got an unauthorized
strike here.

01:55:08.123 --> 01:55:10.024
Uh, we've been instructed
by the national office

01:55:10.093 --> 01:55:11.493
not to honor
this picket line.

01:55:11.561 --> 01:55:13.195
Who instructed you?

01:55:13.264 --> 01:55:17.201
"Vincent Doyle,
senior vice president."

01:55:22.176 --> 01:55:24.343
You mean to tell me
that we're brothers in the same union

01:55:24.413 --> 01:55:25.946
and you won't honor
this picket line?

01:55:26.015 --> 01:55:28.617
You got an unauthorized
wildcat strike here!

01:55:28.685 --> 01:55:30.386
I don't give a damn!

01:55:55.623 --> 01:55:57.490
<i>...Of the strikers
were hospitalized.</i>

01:55:57.559 --> 01:56:00.126
<i>Here in Washington,
Senator Andrew Madison of Pennsylvania,</i>

01:56:00.195 --> 01:56:01.896
<i>the chairman of
the senate rackets committee</i>

01:56:01.965 --> 01:56:04.099
<i>said he will hold
public hearings to probe</i>

01:56:04.168 --> 01:56:07.471
<i>alleged underworld ties
with the union.</i>

01:56:07.539 --> 01:56:12.277
<i>Well, I think it's a sad day
for the labor movement of this country</i>

01:56:12.346 --> 01:56:14.848
<i>when any union has
to resort to force</i>

01:56:14.916 --> 01:56:17.050
<i>to deal with its
own rank and file.</i>

01:56:17.119 --> 01:56:19.921
<i>Will you call
Mr. Kovak to testify?</i>

01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:22.324
<i>You can count on that.</i>

01:56:22.393 --> 01:56:23.827
<i>The Boston Herald
said today,</i>

01:56:23.896 --> 01:56:25.930
<i>that vice president Nixon
is the overwhelming choice...</i>

01:56:25.999 --> 01:56:28.300
What the hell
did you do?

01:56:28.369 --> 01:56:29.902
What the hell
did you do, Vince?

01:56:29.971 --> 01:56:31.137
I didn't do
nothing, Johnny.

01:56:31.206 --> 01:56:32.338
I said, "stop it."

01:56:32.407 --> 01:56:33.774
I didn't say, "put them
in the hospital."

01:56:33.843 --> 01:56:35.175
Nobody meant
to hurt nobody.

01:56:35.244 --> 01:56:37.646
You think Madison's
gonna buy that? Do you?

01:56:37.715 --> 01:56:39.849
Do you think the press
is gonna buy it?

01:56:39.918 --> 01:56:41.719
I've just about had it
with you, Vince.

01:56:54.304 --> 01:56:56.907
Babe, give us a comment.

01:56:56.975 --> 01:56:59.209
How much do they
stand to lose in this?

01:56:59.278 --> 01:57:00.511
It's a beautiful day,
isn't it?

01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:02.047
It's a beautiful day,
Mr. Milano.

01:57:02.115 --> 01:57:04.116
But you're gonna be
losing a lot of money

01:57:04.185 --> 01:57:05.618
in these operations
that have been implicated.

01:57:05.687 --> 01:57:07.354
I love your hat.

01:57:07.423 --> 01:57:09.858
You're a friend of,
uh, John D. Kovak,

01:57:09.927 --> 01:57:11.259
aren't you, Mr. Milano?

01:57:11.327 --> 01:57:13.663
Mr. Milano?

01:57:13.731 --> 01:57:15.933
Mr. Milano, please,
I said, uh,

01:57:16.001 --> 01:57:19.471
you're a friend of
John D. Kovak, aren't you?

01:57:20.474 --> 01:57:22.442
Well, I know him, sure.

01:57:22.510 --> 01:57:25.613
How long have you
had this friendship?

01:57:25.682 --> 01:57:28.450
Oh, I know him,

01:57:28.518 --> 01:57:30.920
I don't know, I've known him
a long time, Senator.

01:57:30.989 --> 01:57:34.291
A long time. Well is it
5, 10, 20 years?

01:57:34.962 --> 01:57:36.628
20 years, I'd say.

01:57:36.697 --> 01:57:39.900
Have you ever had
any trouble with the police?

01:57:39.969 --> 01:57:41.635
A long time ago, Senator.

01:57:42.572 --> 01:57:44.138
But I'm not gonna deny it.

01:57:44.207 --> 01:57:47.242
Well, could you give us
a list of your arrests?

01:57:47.312 --> 01:57:48.878
No, I can't recall.

01:57:48.947 --> 01:57:50.447
You can't recall?

01:57:50.516 --> 01:57:53.218
You can't recall "extortion, bribery,
suspicion of murder,

01:57:53.286 --> 01:57:54.920
Suspicion of conspiracy
to commit murder"?

01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:56.288
Now isn't it a fact,
Mr. Milano,

01:57:56.357 --> 01:57:58.125
that you are one of
the leading figures

01:57:58.193 --> 01:58:00.095
of organized crime
in this country?

01:58:00.163 --> 01:58:03.365
No, it's not. I am
a businessman, that's all.

01:58:04.936 --> 01:58:07.303
Besides, there's no
such thing as that.

01:58:07.372 --> 01:58:08.539
As what?

01:58:08.608 --> 01:58:12.344
That, uh, uh,
organized crime.

01:58:12.412 --> 01:58:16.083
Whenever crime happens,
it's always pretty disorganized, you ask me.

01:58:18.355 --> 01:58:22.125
I'd like to ask you
a question, Mr. Milano.

01:58:22.193 --> 01:58:26.064
Isn't it a fact that you own
the major interest

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:30.971
of the Pyramid Enterprises Corporation
of Las Vegas?

01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:34.909
It's all on my income tax form
you have, Senator.

01:58:34.978 --> 01:58:38.315
And that corporation recently
secured a loan of $2.5 million

01:58:38.383 --> 01:58:41.519
from the pension fund
of the Federation of Interstate Truckers?

01:58:41.588 --> 01:58:43.622
Senator, that's no secret.

01:58:43.691 --> 01:58:46.726
Did you talk to your friend, Mr. Kovak,
about lending you the money?

01:58:46.795 --> 01:58:49.329
I talked to the trustees
of the pension fund.

01:58:49.399 --> 01:58:52.868
Did you talk to your friend, Mr. Kovak,
about giving you the loan?

01:58:52.936 --> 01:58:56.071
Nobody likes to negotiate
with him, Senator.

01:58:56.141 --> 01:58:58.743
I'd rather negotiate
with you any day.

01:59:12.130 --> 01:59:13.563
State your name.

01:59:13.632 --> 01:59:15.733
I respectfully decline
to answer that question

01:59:15.802 --> 01:59:18.637
because I honestly believe
the answer might incriminate me.

01:59:19.707 --> 01:59:21.742
Are you trying to say that

01:59:21.811 --> 01:59:23.977
you are afraid if you
give this committee your name,

01:59:24.046 --> 01:59:25.580
that'll incriminate you?

01:59:28.052 --> 01:59:29.151
It might.

01:59:31.356 --> 01:59:34.124
Well, it must be very
difficult to have a name that's such a burden.

01:59:57.627 --> 02:00:00.462
Isn't it a fact,
Mr. Doyle,

02:00:00.531 --> 02:00:02.431
that without the consent
of the membership,

02:00:02.501 --> 02:00:05.102
union funds are being used
to further the interests

02:00:05.170 --> 02:00:07.070
of organized crime
in this country?

02:00:07.139 --> 02:00:09.240
I respectfully...
I object to this line of questioning.

02:00:09.309 --> 02:00:11.243
We've already...
answer the question.

02:00:13.015 --> 02:00:14.948
I refuse
to answer that question

02:00:15.017 --> 02:00:18.286
because I honestly believe that the answers
might tend to incriminate me.

02:00:18.355 --> 02:00:21.658
Well, is there any question
that this committee

02:00:21.727 --> 02:00:25.095
could possibly ask you
whose answer would not incriminate you?

02:00:29.804 --> 02:00:31.038
I respectfully decline...

02:00:31.106 --> 02:00:32.339
That's enough.

02:00:32.408 --> 02:00:34.175
You disgust me, Sir.

02:00:36.714 --> 02:00:39.650
We'll reconvene at 9:00,
Monday morning.

02:01:02.316 --> 02:01:04.284
I'll tell you something,

02:01:04.352 --> 02:01:07.121
all the trucks and all the horn honking
are not going to stop me

02:01:07.190 --> 02:01:08.791
from putting
Mr. Kovak on the stand.

02:01:12.598 --> 02:01:14.364
I'm worried
about this country.

02:01:14.433 --> 02:01:17.703
I'm worried about the fact
that he paralyzed this city.

02:01:17.771 --> 02:01:19.806
Well, he paralyzed
the nation's capital.

02:01:19.874 --> 02:01:22.209
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

02:01:22.277 --> 02:01:23.945
Or does he own you, too?

02:01:24.014 --> 02:01:25.379
What the hell are
you talking about?

02:01:25.448 --> 02:01:27.249
I'll tell you what
the hell I'm talking about.

02:01:27.318 --> 02:01:28.784
You work for Johnny Kovak

02:01:28.853 --> 02:01:30.420
and he's owned
by Babe Milano.

02:01:30.489 --> 02:01:31.823
It's that simple.

02:01:31.891 --> 02:01:34.893
I work for the union,
nobody else.

02:01:34.962 --> 02:01:36.763
We'll handle
our own problems.

02:01:36.832 --> 02:01:37.998
When?

02:01:41.037 --> 02:01:43.171
You see,

02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:46.275
my committee's
ready to handle it now.

02:01:46.344 --> 02:01:47.978
Not years from now.

02:01:48.748 --> 02:01:50.181
Think about that.

02:01:56.925 --> 02:02:01.830
Well, I...I could say that your silence
condones what's happening.

02:02:05.705 --> 02:02:07.237
All we need

02:02:08.542 --> 02:02:12.211
is a little filler.
Background.

02:02:14.283 --> 02:02:18.120
Mr. Belkin, please.

02:02:24.130 --> 02:02:26.098
Johnny, will you listen to
what I'm telling you?

02:02:26.167 --> 02:02:27.633
Abe is going to testify.

02:02:27.703 --> 02:02:29.869
He came here see Madison.

02:02:29.938 --> 02:02:31.505
I don't believe that, Vince.

02:02:31.574 --> 02:02:33.909
I've had a tail on him
for days. He was there.

02:02:33.977 --> 02:02:35.845
I can't believe that.
Didn't I tell you?

02:02:35.914 --> 02:02:38.816
Didn't I tell you, someday
that son of a bitch would turn on you?

02:02:38.884 --> 02:02:41.720
All right, Vince, you told me, but
I can't believe that.

02:02:41.788 --> 02:02:44.123
Well, Johnny,
you'd better believe it.

02:02:44.192 --> 02:02:46.559
Listen, I think
we've got to get Milano to handle this...

02:02:46.628 --> 02:02:47.994
No, I want Milano
out of it.

02:02:48.064 --> 02:02:49.563
Johnny, you know
what's going to come out?

02:02:49.632 --> 02:02:52.101
All the stuff about the jukeboxes,
the loans, everything.

02:02:52.169 --> 02:02:53.469
They're gonna pin
a bribe on you.

02:02:53.538 --> 02:02:55.504
Vince, I never took nothing in my life,
and you know that.

02:02:55.573 --> 02:02:57.742
They're gonna ruin you
and they're gonna ruin us

02:02:57.810 --> 02:02:59.111
and they're gonna
ruin this union.

02:02:59.179 --> 02:03:01.848
Shut up! No one's
gonna ruin the union!

02:03:06.056 --> 02:03:07.321
Tell him.

02:03:08.425 --> 02:03:09.959
Vince is right, Johnny.

02:03:26.284 --> 02:03:28.684
You know the kind of
heat we're getting?

02:03:28.753 --> 02:03:30.620
I'm not just
talking about me.

02:03:30.689 --> 02:03:32.056
All of us.

02:03:32.125 --> 02:03:33.792
I can handle 'em.

02:03:34.996 --> 02:03:38.131
The Justice Department,
The Treasury, F.B.I.

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:40.367
You're gonna handle
the whole government?

02:03:40.436 --> 02:03:42.404
What do you want me
to do, Babe, run?

02:03:42.472 --> 02:03:44.107
I don't know.

02:03:45.977 --> 02:03:49.447
I was talking
to some of my friends.

02:03:49.516 --> 02:03:51.951
Maybe you ought to
let Vince run it for a while, huh?

02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:54.288
Resign?
You want me to resign?

02:03:54.356 --> 02:03:56.256
You got to think
of the heat, John.

02:03:56.325 --> 02:03:57.892
Look, you don't tell me
how to run my union.

02:03:57.961 --> 02:03:59.628
Now listen, we've been
very good to you.

02:03:59.697 --> 02:04:01.096
You don't tell me that,
all right?

02:04:01.165 --> 02:04:02.999
Belkin testifies,
you're through.

02:04:04.469 --> 02:04:06.871
He isn't going
to take that stand.

02:04:10.979 --> 02:04:13.380
Don't even think it.
You hear me?

02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:18.354
John.

02:04:18.923 --> 02:04:20.457
Hey,

02:04:20.525 --> 02:04:22.760
we've been friends
a long time.

02:04:23.796 --> 02:04:25.898
We ain't never been friends.

02:04:33.610 --> 02:04:37.280
Kovak, time to retire.

02:04:57.277 --> 02:04:58.543
Can I help you?

02:04:58.612 --> 02:04:59.978
Yes, I'd like
to talk to Abe Belkin.

02:05:00.047 --> 02:05:02.282
Abe Belkin is not here now.
If you'd like...

02:05:02.350 --> 02:05:04.084
Johnny.
It's all right.

02:05:04.153 --> 02:05:05.319
Hello, Molly.

02:05:05.388 --> 02:05:06.854
Johnny, you shouldn't
have come here.

02:05:06.924 --> 02:05:08.857
Well, I gotta talk to Abe.

02:05:08.927 --> 02:05:10.794
He doesn't
want to talk.

02:05:10.862 --> 02:05:13.464
But it's important to both of you
that I talk to him.

02:05:13.533 --> 02:05:14.799
Please, he doesn't...

02:05:14.867 --> 02:05:15.968
Who is it?

02:05:17.405 --> 02:05:18.638
It's Johnny.

02:05:18.706 --> 02:05:20.040
Johnny.

02:05:20.108 --> 02:05:23.044
Johnny! Remember me?
Babe, it's all right.

02:05:23.914 --> 02:05:25.314
Sorry.

02:05:26.651 --> 02:05:29.820
It's Johnny Kovak,
from the union?

02:05:29.888 --> 02:05:32.857
What the hell are you
doing down here, Abe?

02:05:32.926 --> 02:05:34.860
It's all right, Walt.

02:05:37.899 --> 02:05:39.667
We've got nothing
to talk about.

02:05:40.403 --> 02:05:41.770
How you feeling?

02:05:41.839 --> 02:05:42.972
Fine.

02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:44.307
Good.

02:05:46.378 --> 02:05:48.446
What's that you're fixing?
A chair?

02:05:48.514 --> 02:05:50.148
Yeah.

02:05:50.217 --> 02:05:52.251
You always were pretty good
with your hands.

02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:54.621
Johnny, say what
you gotta say.

02:05:55.724 --> 02:05:57.625
All right.

02:05:57.694 --> 02:05:59.828
Look, Abe,
you've got a family.

02:05:59.897 --> 02:06:03.400
That's got to be the most
important thing to you. Am I right?

02:06:03.469 --> 02:06:05.936
It is. It's your job
to stay safe.

02:06:06.006 --> 02:06:07.606
So please,
we have problems.

02:06:07.674 --> 02:06:09.174
Don't testify
for Madison.

02:06:09.243 --> 02:06:11.611
Let's take it before
the union review board.

02:06:11.679 --> 02:06:13.847
Johnny, you are
the union review board.

02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:18.754
I don't want
to see you get hurt.

02:06:20.692 --> 02:06:22.627
Are you gonna hurt me,
Johnny?

02:06:22.695 --> 02:06:23.728
No.

02:06:28.404 --> 02:06:29.970
I came to help.

02:06:30.040 --> 02:06:31.305
I know.

02:06:34.078 --> 02:06:37.347
All I want to do is clean it up.
Get it right.

02:06:37.417 --> 02:06:39.183
Get rid of Milano, Doyle.

02:06:39.252 --> 02:06:41.920
People like that who never should
have been allowed in.

02:06:41.988 --> 02:06:44.990
Sorry, Johnny, you slept with them,
I didn't.

02:06:45.061 --> 02:06:46.560
I don't owe them nothing.

02:06:46.628 --> 02:06:49.697
Yeah, but I had to make deals,
you should know that.

02:06:49.766 --> 02:06:51.333
I know, I know.

02:06:57.677 --> 02:06:59.478
Do you have to do it?

02:07:02.784 --> 02:07:03.984
Yeah.

02:07:07.657 --> 02:07:09.092
Then do it.

02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:15.801
You know what
the problem is? Hmm?

02:07:15.869 --> 02:07:17.769
What?

02:07:17.838 --> 02:07:20.908
We should never have left
the old neighborhood.

02:07:22.178 --> 02:07:23.312
Yeah.

02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:25.247
Come here.

02:07:26.718 --> 02:07:28.586
Take care of yourself,
all right?

02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:49.948
Are you sure you
don't want me to come?

02:07:50.017 --> 02:07:53.719
No, I don't want you to be bothered
by all those reporters.

02:07:53.788 --> 02:07:55.756
I can stay in the hotel.

02:07:57.661 --> 02:07:59.995
No, it's best
you stay here.

02:08:04.204 --> 02:08:06.972
Now, this won't be
a long trip, all right?

02:08:07.041 --> 02:08:09.041
Ok, so you call
as soon as you land.

02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:10.477
Sure, sure.

02:08:10.546 --> 02:08:12.112
Where're the boys?

02:08:12.182 --> 02:08:13.681
In school.

02:08:13.749 --> 02:08:15.717
I must be growing senile.

02:08:15.786 --> 02:08:17.019
I love you.

02:08:20.126 --> 02:08:22.327
What brought that on?

02:08:22.396 --> 02:08:24.430
It must be the heat.

02:08:25.299 --> 02:08:27.234
You stay out of the heat.

02:08:58.979 --> 02:09:00.713
Ok, this is a holdup!

02:09:00.782 --> 02:09:02.482
Everybody down
on the floor!

02:09:02.551 --> 02:09:03.917
Get down on the floor!

02:09:03.986 --> 02:09:05.987
Everybody down
on the floor!

02:09:06.056 --> 02:09:07.957
Everybody down,
nobody gets hurt!

02:09:08.025 --> 02:09:09.492
Get on the floor.

02:09:09.561 --> 02:09:10.994
Stay down on the floor,
nobody gets hurt.

02:09:11.063 --> 02:09:12.696
Don't move.

02:09:12.764 --> 02:09:14.599
Hurry up.

02:09:14.667 --> 02:09:16.569
Don't look up here, lady.

02:09:19.074 --> 02:09:20.474
Stop moving.

02:09:22.579 --> 02:09:24.379
Run, Abe, get out of here!

02:09:31.258 --> 02:09:32.457
Go!

02:10:05.205 --> 02:10:06.572
Government used to use

02:10:06.641 --> 02:10:08.707
goons and clubs against us,
now they use Senators.

02:10:08.776 --> 02:10:10.410
Mr. Kovak, are you not

02:10:10.479 --> 02:10:12.480
in connection
with Babe Milano?

02:10:13.816 --> 02:10:16.619
Mr. Kovak, can we have
a quote, please?

02:10:42.324 --> 02:10:45.959
You want to rise, Mr. Kovak?

02:10:46.028 --> 02:10:48.630
Do you solemnly swear
the evidence you give before

02:10:48.699 --> 02:10:50.999
this senate select committee
shall be the truth,

02:10:51.068 --> 02:10:53.937
the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

02:10:54.005 --> 02:10:55.240
I do.

02:11:02.183 --> 02:11:04.118
Can we have quiet, please?

02:11:04.186 --> 02:11:06.321
Can we have quiet?

02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:11.762
I'm sure we all want to hear
every single word that Mr. Kovak has to say.

02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:15.934
But, uh, before
we begin this hearing,

02:11:16.003 --> 02:11:20.173
I'd like to express
my sympathy.

02:11:20.242 --> 02:11:25.113
Abe Belkin,
a west coast union official,

02:11:25.182 --> 02:11:29.186
who was scheduled
to testify here today

02:11:29.255 --> 02:11:31.723
was killed less
than 12 hours ago.

02:11:33.461 --> 02:11:35.261
Senator Madison,
Senator Madison.

02:11:35.330 --> 02:11:37.698
Senator Madison,
in consideration of these events

02:11:37.767 --> 02:11:41.304
I move for a postponement
of this hearing for at least 48 hours.

02:11:41.372 --> 02:11:45.709
I am sure we're all aggrieved
by Mr. Belkin's demise,

02:11:45.779 --> 02:11:49.348
but I don't see that
for grounds of postponement beyond belief.

02:11:49.417 --> 02:11:51.818
Does Mr. Kovak wish
to have a postponement?

02:11:51.886 --> 02:11:54.254
And if so, uh,
for what reasons?

02:11:54.324 --> 02:11:57.926
Senator, I'm sure everybody here realizes
how close that mister...

02:12:05.339 --> 02:12:07.673
I came to testify.
I'll testify.

02:12:07.742 --> 02:12:11.379
All right, thank you,
Mr. Kovak.

02:12:11.448 --> 02:12:13.581
Uh, just for the record.

02:12:13.650 --> 02:12:15.517
You are the, uh,
international president

02:12:15.586 --> 02:12:18.355
of the Federation of Interstate Truckers,
are you not?

02:12:18.423 --> 02:12:19.623
Yes.

02:12:19.692 --> 02:12:22.093
Would you speak up?
We can't hear you.

02:12:22.162 --> 02:12:23.495
Yes.

02:12:23.564 --> 02:12:26.466
And how many members
do you have in your union?

02:12:28.671 --> 02:12:30.505
Nearly 3 million.

02:12:30.574 --> 02:12:34.009
And what exactly is the scope of your
authority as president?

02:12:35.981 --> 02:12:37.682
I represent the men.

02:12:37.751 --> 02:12:39.183
Is that all?

02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:45.826
In a recent article in a national magazine
you are quoted as stating:

02:12:45.895 --> 02:12:49.766
"Everything on
wheels" is yours.

02:12:54.072 --> 02:12:55.907
I represent the men.

02:12:55.975 --> 02:13:00.280
But isn't it frightening to think of all that power
in the hands of one man?

02:13:00.348 --> 02:13:01.915
No, Senator, it doesn't.

02:13:01.983 --> 02:13:03.150
I see.

02:13:03.219 --> 02:13:05.754
Isn't it a fact
that the Federation in your hands

02:13:05.823 --> 02:13:08.324
gained a reputation
for, uh, strongarm tactics?

02:13:10.162 --> 02:13:11.429
That's not true.

02:13:11.497 --> 02:13:14.332
And isn't it a fact
that many of your members,

02:13:14.401 --> 02:13:17.871
especially the business agents,
have criminal records?

02:13:20.109 --> 02:13:21.275
Some.

02:13:21.344 --> 02:13:22.945
Oh, you admit that?

02:13:23.013 --> 02:13:26.583
Senator, because a man makes a mistake,
should his life be ruined?

02:13:26.652 --> 02:13:29.119
I was arrested over 30 times
in strike actions

02:13:29.188 --> 02:13:30.856
trying to get
a decent living wage.

02:13:30.925 --> 02:13:32.558
Am I a criminal for that?

02:13:35.263 --> 02:13:38.834
Do you think that,
uh, Vincent Doyle,

02:13:38.902 --> 02:13:41.103
a vice president of your union,

02:13:41.172 --> 02:13:43.907
should be
suspended from office

02:13:43.976 --> 02:13:46.878
because he refused
to, uh, testify here

02:13:46.947 --> 02:13:50.282
on the grounds of
self-incrimination?

02:13:51.453 --> 02:13:52.853
If he takes the fifth.

02:13:52.921 --> 02:13:54.054
That's right.

02:13:56.994 --> 02:14:00.597
It's part of the bill of rights,
it's in the constitution.

02:14:00.665 --> 02:14:02.600
It's what this
country's all about.

02:14:02.668 --> 02:14:04.469
Now you make the laws,
Senator, I don't.

02:14:04.538 --> 02:14:06.071
I can't go against that.

02:14:10.212 --> 02:14:14.884
Do, uh, do you know
Anthony Milano?

02:14:16.788 --> 02:14:18.187
I know him.

02:14:18.256 --> 02:14:19.957
You're friends?

02:14:20.026 --> 02:14:22.460
I know him.

02:14:22.530 --> 02:14:25.398
Well, didn't your union recently give one of
Mr. Milano's concerns,

02:14:25.466 --> 02:14:27.902
the pyramid enterprises
corporation of Las Vegas,

02:14:27.970 --> 02:14:31.172
a loan of $2.5 million
from your pension fund

02:14:31.241 --> 02:14:35.245
and additional loans
totaling $6.2 million?

02:14:35.313 --> 02:14:36.748
Yes.

02:14:36.816 --> 02:14:40.553
Did Mr. Milano ask you
to get him that loan as a favor?

02:14:40.621 --> 02:14:42.288
He asked the trustees.

02:14:42.357 --> 02:14:44.692
Well, you're one of
the pension fund trustees.

02:14:44.761 --> 02:14:45.960
Yes, I am.

02:14:46.029 --> 02:14:47.663
So then you voted
to give him the loan?

02:14:47.731 --> 02:14:49.265
Along with 11 others.

02:14:49.333 --> 02:14:51.768
How long have you
known Mr. Milano?

02:14:54.474 --> 02:14:55.774
A long time.

02:14:55.842 --> 02:14:57.843
Well, have you and Mr. Milano
ever been involved

02:14:57.912 --> 02:14:59.947
in, uh, previous
business transactions?

02:15:02.018 --> 02:15:03.851
There might have been one,
I don't remember.

02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:07.190
I have here a sworn statement
by Abe Belkin stating otherwise.

02:15:07.258 --> 02:15:11.028
And what about
the Haley Jukebox Company of Pontiac, Michigan?

02:15:11.097 --> 02:15:12.931
Isn't it a fact, Mr. Kovak,

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.334
that when you headed the Midwest council
of your union,

02:15:15.403 --> 02:15:17.605
you forced businessmen
to use Haley jukeboxes?

02:15:17.673 --> 02:15:19.941
I personally never forced
anyone to do that.

02:15:20.010 --> 02:15:21.610
Isn't it a fact that
you told bar owners

02:15:21.678 --> 02:15:23.145
that unless they
used Haley jukeboxes

02:15:23.214 --> 02:15:24.982
your drivers would never
deliver liquor to them?

02:15:25.050 --> 02:15:27.819
Senator, at...at the time,
I didn't have a choice.

02:15:27.887 --> 02:15:30.055
Oh, come on now,
Mr. Kovak.

02:15:30.123 --> 02:15:33.059
We all have a choice.
Isn't it a fact that at the time

02:15:33.127 --> 02:15:35.930
the Haley Jukebox Company was owned
by Mr. Anthony Milano?

02:15:35.998 --> 02:15:38.733
He may have had
an interest in it, yes.

02:15:38.802 --> 02:15:40.736
Yes. And isn't it true that

02:15:40.805 --> 02:15:43.907
to convince you to help
his firm Mr. Milano paid you a bribe?

02:15:43.976 --> 02:15:45.477
That's a lie.

02:15:45.545 --> 02:15:47.345
That's...
get away from me.

02:15:47.413 --> 02:15:49.414
A bribe in the form
of a wedding present?

02:15:49.484 --> 02:15:51.317
That's a lie you dreamed up
for your headlines.

02:15:51.386 --> 02:15:53.888
You're under oath here, Sir,

02:15:53.957 --> 02:15:56.191
and I want
to tell you something.

02:15:56.259 --> 02:15:59.128
I have tapes and I have depositions here
that says you're dreaming

02:15:59.197 --> 02:16:01.465
if you think you can discredit
this senate hearing.

02:16:01.534 --> 02:16:02.766
You are under oath, Sir.

02:16:02.835 --> 02:16:04.068
I know what I'm under,
Senator,

02:16:04.137 --> 02:16:06.238
I'm telling you I never
took anything in my life.

02:16:06.307 --> 02:16:07.306
Nothing?

02:16:07.375 --> 02:16:08.408
Nothing.

02:16:12.849 --> 02:16:15.417
Did you ever kill anybody,
Mr. Kovak?

02:16:18.725 --> 02:16:21.326
No, Senator,
I never killed anybody.

02:16:21.395 --> 02:16:23.028
So your answer's "no"?

02:16:23.096 --> 02:16:24.330
That's right.

02:16:24.399 --> 02:16:26.166
What's right?

02:16:26.235 --> 02:16:28.602
That's right,
that I never killed anybody.

02:16:28.672 --> 02:16:30.171
Are you sure?

02:16:34.513 --> 02:16:37.949
Isn't it a fact,
that in 1938,

02:16:39.053 --> 02:16:42.487
in a strike riot led by you,

02:16:42.558 --> 02:16:45.259
you killed a man
with an axe handle?

02:16:52.605 --> 02:16:54.673
Senator,
it was self-defense.

02:16:54.741 --> 02:16:57.142
And isn't it a fact
that you continually

02:16:57.210 --> 02:17:00.681
and repeatedly beat him
about the head until you caused his death?

02:17:00.749 --> 02:17:03.284
It was self-defense.

02:17:03.352 --> 02:17:06.154
Answer the question,
Mr. Kovak.

02:17:06.223 --> 02:17:09.392
Did you commit
murder in 1938?

02:17:10.029 --> 02:17:12.564
Or more importantly,

02:17:12.633 --> 02:17:16.502
did you conspire to arrange for the murder
of Abe Belkin less than 12 hours ago?

02:17:16.571 --> 02:17:17.905
That's a lie!

02:17:17.974 --> 02:17:20.642
I am not gonna sit here
and be accused of all kinds of things

02:17:20.710 --> 02:17:21.942
without a shred of evidence.

02:17:22.012 --> 02:17:23.879
Answer the question.

02:17:23.948 --> 02:17:26.316
I tried to give you the truth. You don't want
the truth. Abe was like my brother.

02:17:26.384 --> 02:17:27.619
You're not
answering the question...

02:17:27.687 --> 02:17:29.286
We lived and
we built this union together.

02:17:29.355 --> 02:17:31.022
What the hell do you know
about anything?

02:17:31.092 --> 02:17:32.626
You just wanna see
your name in the paper

02:17:32.693 --> 02:17:34.761
next to a bunch of goddamn lies.
Get off me!

02:17:34.830 --> 02:17:38.100
You think I'm gonna sit here and let you
make a living off of my brother's blood,

02:17:38.168 --> 02:17:39.934
you son of a bitch?
We can hold you in contempt.

02:17:40.004 --> 02:17:42.673
You do whatever you want.
I am not answering anything anymore.

02:17:42.742 --> 02:17:45.175
Well then, Sir, you are in contempt!
I hold you in contempt!

02:17:45.245 --> 02:17:46.511
I hold this hearing
in contempt!

02:17:46.579 --> 02:17:47.813
I hold Milano in contempt!

02:17:47.882 --> 02:17:49.849
I hold myself in contempt!

02:18:01.367 --> 02:18:03.368
Silence, please. Silence.

02:18:25.233 --> 02:18:28.035
Kovak! Kovak!

02:18:47.598 --> 02:18:48.897
What are we?

02:18:48.967 --> 02:18:50.333
FIST!

02:18:51.938 --> 02:18:53.037
What are we?

02:18:53.106 --> 02:18:54.306
FIST!

02:18:54.375 --> 02:18:55.441
What are we?

02:18:55.509 --> 02:18:57.843
FIST! FIST!

02:19:24.782 --> 02:19:26.083
You look tired.

02:19:26.152 --> 02:19:27.951
Yeah, it's late, Bernie.

02:19:28.021 --> 02:19:29.387
Thank you.

02:19:30.725 --> 02:19:32.959
Listen, do you want to come in
for a drink?

02:19:33.028 --> 02:19:35.597
Thanks, Johnny,
but I am really tired.

02:19:35.665 --> 02:19:37.132
Sure.

02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:39.268
Bernie, it's just that
I wanted to talk.

02:19:39.337 --> 02:19:41.037
Do you want to talk?

02:19:41.106 --> 02:19:44.108
Johnny, if it's ok with you,
I just want to go home and get some sleep.

02:19:44.177 --> 02:19:46.378
Sure, I understand.
Good night.

02:19:49.951 --> 02:19:51.252
Get some rest.

02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:53.455
I'll see you in the office
in the morning.

02:19:53.524 --> 02:19:55.658
Yeah.
Goodnight, Bernie.

02:21:01.785 --> 02:21:02.917
Anna.

02:21:05.123 --> 02:21:06.657
Anna!

02:21:06.726 --> 02:21:07.725
Anna!

02:21:10.130 --> 02:21:11.631
Anna, no!

02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:14.200
Anna!
