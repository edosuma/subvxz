<i>[Man Narrating]
We're looking into a classroom.</i>

00:46.213 --> 00:49.888
<i>You know it's a classroom
because your eyes tell you.</i>

00:50.008 --> 00:52.181
<i>Think for a moment
how many things you know...</i>

00:52.302 --> 00:54.646
<i>just because your eyes tell you.</i>

00:54.763 --> 00:58.063
<i>You know what the weather is like
when you look outside.</i>

00:59.560 --> 01:02.439
<i>You know that Tommy Walker
wore his plaid shirt today.</i>

01:03.855 --> 01:06.108
<i>You can read your lessons
and learn things...</i>

01:06.233 --> 01:08.406
<i>because you can see.</i>

01:08.527 --> 01:12.282
<i>You know your teacher better
because you can see her.</i>

01:13.407 --> 01:16.411
<i>Watch, now.
Use your eyes...</i>

01:16.535 --> 01:20.039
<i>and you'll learn how you can take
good care of your eyes.</i>

01:21.039 --> 01:23.383
About five years ago,
I was running a lathe...

01:23.500 --> 01:26.003
and had safety glasses on,
and as I was running the lathe...

01:26.128 --> 01:28.927
a piece of hot steel chipped off...

01:29.047 --> 01:32.802
bounced off of my cheek,
off the glass, and went into my eye.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.645
So, um, in about a day or two,
I couldn't really see.

01:35.762 --> 01:39.232
My eye was really hurting bad.
I couldn't even do paperwork in my office.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.647
The fluorescent light in my office
would hurt my eye.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.146
I had to wear sunglasses
while I was doing paperwork.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.990
So eventually I went to the doctor.

01:47.149 --> 01:50.403
When I got there, I told him,
"My eye's killing me. I can't really see out of it."

01:50.527 --> 01:53.497
So he put some liquid cocaine
eyedrops in...

01:53.614 --> 01:56.584
which immediately just - relief.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.294
I could see everything/ I thought it was
over with. I was ready to leave.

01:59.411 --> 02:02.210
And the doctor said, "No, no, no,"
so he brought me into the office...

02:02.331 --> 02:04.754
and when I went into the office,
he took a swab...

02:04.875 --> 02:07.344
put a chemical on it,
and rubbed it into my eye.

02:07.461 --> 02:11.386
After he did that, he turned out the lights
and put on an ultraviolet light.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.726
He looked in, and everything
was glowing in my eye.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.187
He said he could see
a big ole' sliver of steel...

02:17.304 --> 02:20.478
that was right on the edge
of the blue part right next to the pupil...

02:20.599 --> 02:22.679
and he said if it'd been over
just a fraction more...

02:22.726 --> 02:24.854
it would've put my eye out.

02:25.020 --> 02:29.116
So I asked him what to do, and he said,
"Put your head in this harness."

02:29.232 --> 02:31.360
So I put my head
in the harness like this...

02:31.485 --> 02:33.362
and he pulled out
a hypodermic needle.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.910
I thought I was getting a shot in the eye,
and he said, "No, don't worry."

02:36.031 --> 02:39.205
He took the needle off the end of it,
and he came at my eye...

02:39.326 --> 02:43.251
and pulled out a piece of steel
about an inch long out of my eye.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.541
And that's about it.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.671
Well, I sleep with my eyes open...

02:49.795 --> 02:53.516
and they dry out,
and then when I blink...

02:53.632 --> 02:57.262
my eyelids tear
pieces of my eye off.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.309
Very painful.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.729
And I've tried a number of things...

03:02.891 --> 03:05.394
to try to keep this
from happening.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.484
I wrapped an ACE bandage
around my eyes one night...

03:08.605 --> 03:11.028
to try to keep them shut,
but that didn't work...

03:11.149 --> 03:14.904
and tried loading my eyes up
with all kinds of goop...

03:15.028 --> 03:17.281
to keep them wet during the night -
that didn't work.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.408
So what I've been doing is...

03:19.574 --> 03:21.417
taping them shut at night...

03:21.576 --> 03:23.795
which seems to work okay.

03:23.912 --> 03:27.416
But it's pretty uncomfortable.
It looks pretty funny too.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.761
Well, what happened -
I went to dinner with the wife...

03:30.877 --> 03:33.756
and, um, I started getting
a headache...

03:33.880 --> 03:36.303
a real bad headache,
and I never was sick before...

03:36.425 --> 03:38.928
so I said,
"Well, let's go to a hospital."

03:39.094 --> 03:41.688
She said, "You just got a headache.
Let's go home and get some aspirin."

03:41.805 --> 03:44.103
I said, "No, let's go to the hospital."

03:44.224 --> 03:47.023
So we went to Baptist Hospital...

03:47.144 --> 03:50.364
and we got there,
and my eye started closing.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.029
My, uh - It just started -

03:53.150 --> 03:55.824
One eye just started closing,
on the right.

03:55.944 --> 03:59.949
And it started hurting real bad,
and I was talking to the nurse...

04:00.115 --> 04:01.958
and the doctor was coming
through the hall...

04:02.117 --> 04:04.620
while I was explaining to her
what was going on.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.794
And he looked at me and grabbed me
and took me upstairs...

04:07.956 --> 04:10.926
and they took me right into X-ray,
and they checked it out.

04:11.042 --> 04:15.297
And what it was, it was
an aneurysm behind my optic nerve...

04:15.464 --> 04:18.512
and it was pressing against the nerve,
and it started ballooning out...

04:18.632 --> 04:20.930
and it started getting
ready to bust.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.521
And they took me
right into surgery.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.016
They cut my deal open...

04:26.141 --> 04:28.644
and did microscopic surgery...

04:28.810 --> 04:31.529
right behind the optic nerve.

04:31.646 --> 04:35.492
They sealed off the blood vessel
that was ballooning out.

04:35.650 --> 04:39.075
And later the doctor told me
if I would've waited...

04:39.196 --> 04:42.871
like an hour more, I wouldn't
be living today, you know.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.834
And the wife told me to go home.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.626
If I'd have went home,
I wouldn't have made it to the hospital.

04:48.747 --> 04:52.547
Well, it's really difficult
to tell anybody this story...

04:52.667 --> 04:56.012
because it was
such a dumb thing to do, but...

04:56.171 --> 04:58.469
I accidentally...

04:58.590 --> 05:01.184
put Super Glue in my eye...

05:01.301 --> 05:03.850
thinking I was putting eyedrops.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.185
It was very late at night.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.684
I guess things like this
always happen late at night...

05:08.850 --> 05:11.194
but my husband drags me off
to the emergency room.

05:11.353 --> 05:14.152
I'm screaming.
I think I've been disfigured...

05:14.272 --> 05:17.321
or blinded, at the least.

05:17.442 --> 05:22.243
We're there for several hours,
and I'm told that...

05:22.364 --> 05:25.743
I can either have surgery
to open the eye...

05:25.867 --> 05:28.541
or I can just wait...

05:28.703 --> 05:31.172
for the Super Glue to dissolve.

05:31.289 --> 05:35.135
I understand it does not
adhere to human tissue...

05:35.252 --> 05:38.256
and I was told that that would
probably be the best option.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.475
So that's what I did.
I waited...

05:41.591 --> 05:44.845
three or four days,
and finally it just loosened on its own.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.972
And it all flaked out...

05:47.097 --> 05:49.395
and I'm not blind.

05:49.516 --> 05:54.238
I have funny eyelashes,
but otherwise I'm okay.

05:54.354 --> 05:58.200
It was about ten years ago.
I was doing a brake job on my pickup truck...

05:58.316 --> 06:01.490
and, uh, I was cleaning
the backing plate.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.706
I had it up on blocks.
I had the wheels and everything torn apart...

06:04.823 --> 06:07.372
and I was cleaning the backing plate
with a wire brush...

06:07.492 --> 06:09.665
on an air tool...

06:09.786 --> 06:12.630
and there was one spot left,
about the size of a quarter...

06:12.747 --> 06:15.375
and the only way I could see it
was to look around to the side.

06:15.500 --> 06:19.380
And it was throwing dirt back on me,
so I thought about getting safety glasses...

06:19.504 --> 06:22.132
but then I thought,
"Nah, it's only the size of a quarter.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.601
I'll finish it right away."
So I stuck the tool back in...

06:24.718 --> 06:26.595
and sure enough,
a little dirt in the eye.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.684
So I went into my trailer...

06:28.805 --> 06:30.807
and I went into the bathroom.

06:30.932 --> 06:34.106
I looked in the mirror
and opened my eye up like this...

06:34.227 --> 06:37.777
and sure enough, bull's-eye -
a piece of wire sticking straight in the eye.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.863
And I tried to grab it
with my finger...

06:40.984 --> 06:43.703
and it was too short,
so I went outside and got my pliers...

06:43.820 --> 06:45.948
wiped the grease off, came in,
grabbed hold of 'em...

06:46.072 --> 06:48.825
and I started pulling,
and the eye was stretching out.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.123
And I thought,
"I don't know what I should do...

06:51.286 --> 06:53.789
but if I go see a doctor,
they'll have to take it out."

06:53.955 --> 06:56.959
So I grabbed it again with the pliers
and pulled it out...

06:57.083 --> 06:59.632
and when I did,
it tore a hole in the eye...

06:59.794 --> 07:02.172
and the front sac of the eye
drained all the fluid out...

07:02.297 --> 07:04.425
and I was blinded in one eye.

07:04.549 --> 07:08.099
And the worst part was, I had
to finish the brake job with one eye -

07:08.219 --> 07:11.769
two and a half hours -
so I could drive into town and see a doctor.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.860
Well, this incident took place
right after a karate event.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.944
I had placed well in a tournament...

07:17.062 --> 07:20.987
was leaving the exhibit hall,
and was carrying a trophy.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.781
I sensed something
was wrong, though.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.621
I did a 360-degree turnaround.

07:26.738 --> 07:29.992
I really felt something was wrong.
Maybe somebody was there.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.278
But I was excited
I had done well at the tournament...

07:32.327 --> 07:34.500
so I proceeded on
to the parking lot...

07:34.663 --> 07:38.759
took a couple of steps, and someone
or something hit me from behind.

07:38.875 --> 07:42.004
I later found out to be the trophy,
the karate trophy I was carrying...

07:42.128 --> 07:45.177
with the foot figure
and the hand figure...

07:45.340 --> 07:47.593
it raked right across my eye...

07:47.717 --> 07:49.594
and I fell to the ground...

07:49.719 --> 07:52.142
and immediately
put my hand upon my eye...

07:52.263 --> 07:55.358
and felt a golf-ball-size object...

07:55.475 --> 07:57.694
which I later found out
to be my eye.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.939
My instinct was to push up.

08:00.063 --> 08:03.067
I pushed and held pressure
and looked up...

08:03.191 --> 08:05.569
and there was someone
taunting me...

08:05.694 --> 08:07.696
and I later found out
it was to be someone...

08:07.862 --> 08:10.411
who I'd fought earlier in the day
at the karate event.

08:10.532 --> 08:13.081
I went on a fishing trip
with some kids.

08:13.201 --> 08:16.296
We were on the bank of
Camp Singing Waters River...

08:16.413 --> 08:18.415
and while we were standing there,
I was baiting my hook...

08:18.540 --> 08:21.214
and somebody in front of me
must have flipped back their pole.

08:21.376 --> 08:24.095
And I can still see this image,
and their arm's about to move forward...

08:24.212 --> 08:26.715
and a tug on my eyelid,
and the hook had come...

08:26.840 --> 08:29.468
right through my eyelid
and was pulling my eyelid out.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.720
A lady grabbed the kid,
knocked him to the ground...

08:31.845 --> 08:33.472
and grabbed the string.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.224
Somehow they cut the string,
and I had to walk back to the camp.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.486
After they took the worm off,
all I had was a hook sticking in my eye...

08:39.602 --> 08:41.445
and they were able to get it out.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.908
Well, I was cleaning my mother's oven
with a heavy-duty oven cleaner...

08:45.066 --> 08:47.694
and the thought had crossed my mind
to put some glasses on.

08:47.819 --> 08:51.289
And right at that moment, I hit the back
corner of the oven with the sponge...

08:51.406 --> 08:54.205
and it sprayed right into my left eye.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.748
And the pain was just excruciating...

08:56.870 --> 09:01.046
and I immediately ran to the sink
and started flushing my eye with water.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.716
And once I regained
some of my thoughts and composure...

09:04.836 --> 09:07.180
I ran into the shower and shaved -

09:07.297 --> 09:09.425
not "shaved," excuse me -

09:09.549 --> 09:12.473
washed my eye out,
oh, for about 20 minutes.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.847
And then I realized that I had no money...

09:14.971 --> 09:18.271
and no way to get to a hospital,
because I'm in Washington, D.C...

09:18.391 --> 09:20.610
and my mother was out with the car.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.981
So at that point,
I decided to make some phone calls...

09:24.105 --> 09:25.982
and call my dad, and he's a doctor...

09:26.107 --> 09:28.235
and he said that I did the right thing.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.236
And at that point, Mom came home...

09:30.361 --> 09:32.989
took me to the emergency room,
where they signed me in...

09:33.114 --> 09:35.617
and I had to wait about two hours
until the doctor told me...

09:35.784 --> 09:37.627
that I saved my own eye.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.585
And that's pretty much
what happened to my eye.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.714

09:45.381 --> 09:47.720
<i>[ Spalding Gray]
I think - I think it all began...</i>

09:47.837 --> 09:49.965
<i>the summer that I turned 50.</i>

09:50.131 --> 09:54.511
I was leading a storytelling workshop
in upstate New York, about 15 people in it.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.797
I asked them before they began
telling their stories...

09:56.846 --> 10:00.020
to sit in a circle
as a kind of centering exercise...

10:00.141 --> 10:02.269
and just look into one another's eyes.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.895
Just eyes.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.988
"When you get tired of looking
into one person's eyes...

10:06.106 --> 10:08.905
move on to the next,
and so on around the circle."

10:09.025 --> 10:11.869
And I was participating
in this exercise...

10:11.986 --> 10:15.331
and I got locked into the eyes...

10:15.448 --> 10:19.078
of this one particular woman
and could not get out.

10:19.202 --> 10:22.001
Her name: Azaria Thornbird.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.420
She was tall, blond, blue eyes...

10:24.541 --> 10:28.091
about 33 years old, dressed in white -
the Immaculate Conception.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.464
And I got locked into her eyes
and mesmerized.

10:30.588 --> 10:33.967
And as I was staring at her face,
I saw that it was slowly decomposing...

10:34.092 --> 10:37.312
and drooling down off of her skull
like a horror movie.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.476
- Like a bad LSD trip.
<i>- ♫ [ Intensifies ]</i>

10:39.597 --> 10:42.942
And all of a sudden, her face turned
into this pulsing oval ball of white light.

10:43.059 --> 10:46.529
I'd never seen anything like it except
on the cover of a Carlos Castaneda book.

10:46.688 --> 10:49.817
And it was dilating my pupils, this light.
Then all of a sudden - boom!

10:49.941 --> 10:52.035
It came together in a point,
shot out the window...

10:52.152 --> 10:54.200
like a white tornado,
and her face recomposed...

10:54.320 --> 10:56.197
and was smiling back at me.

10:56.364 --> 11:00.085
- And immediately my rational,
logical voice kicked in and said...

"That was just a case
of backlighting, wasn't it?

11:03.746 --> 11:06.841
Dilating my pupils like that -
it was extreme backlighting.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.972
Backlighting."

11:13.590 --> 11:15.467
So I got back home...

11:15.592 --> 11:17.890
where I was trying
to work on and finish my novel...

11:18.011 --> 11:20.309
<i>Impossible Vacation.</i>

11:20.430 --> 11:23.024
And I was reading over and over
a particularly painful section...

11:23.141 --> 11:25.189
about my mother's suicide...

11:25.310 --> 11:27.187
trying to get it right...

11:27.312 --> 11:30.907
and I noticed that the print
on the page was breaking down.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.989
I assumed it couldn't be the print.
I thought it must be eye fatigue.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.363
So I remember
playing around with my eyes.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.660
I started by covering my left eye...

11:38.781 --> 11:40.658
and everything on the right
was in focus...

11:40.783 --> 11:43.081
no matter
where I put the manuscript.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.672
Then I covered my right...

11:45.788 --> 11:48.132
and everything was out of focus...

11:48.249 --> 11:51.219
no matter where
I held the manuscript.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.304
And this was pretty frightening.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.391
It was so frightening,
I thought I'd better forget about it.

11:56.507 --> 12:00.228
Finish the novel first,
then worry about my eyes.

12:01.346 --> 12:05.067
So it was about four months before I got up
the courage to get an eye examination.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.652
I didn't have an ophthalmologist,
so I had one recommended to me...

12:07.769 --> 12:09.942
a Dr. Schecter
on the Upper East Side.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.408
And I went up for the standard exam,
not telling him anything about my eyes...

12:13.524 --> 12:16.243
and he began with a little penlight,
shining it into my right eye...

12:16.361 --> 12:18.455
then over to my left,
then to my right again.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.120
Things were going smoothly.
Over to my left.

12:21.282 --> 12:24.456
Then just as he's pulling to my right,
he goes left, left.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.667
He brings down all these
other instruments. Left, left, left.

12:26.788 --> 12:30.213
It's like a scene from <i>General Hospital,</i>
only the dramatic music is missing.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.711
He pulls all the instruments away,
and he says...

12:32.835 --> 12:35.556
"I think you have something wrong
with the retina of your left eye...

12:35.672 --> 12:39.017
but I can't tell you what it is
because I'm not a retina specialist.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.010
But I can recommend one to you,
and I think...

12:41.135 --> 12:44.105
you should go to him
<i>this afternoon. "</i>

12:44.222 --> 12:47.226
So he recommends a Dr. Mendel
on the Upper West Side.

12:47.350 --> 12:50.820
I don't even bother to take a cab. I charge
from the Upper East to the Upper West...

12:50.937 --> 12:53.377
running through Central Park
with my hand over my right eye...

12:53.398 --> 12:55.742
noticing, "Oh, my God!
This is really serious.

12:55.858 --> 12:58.031
The trees are all wavy.
There's no right angles.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.120
The Rollerbladers are fuzz balls."

13:00.238 --> 13:02.638
I get to Dr. Mendel's office.
The first thing that happens...

13:02.699 --> 13:04.827
is the nurse comes out,
and she puts drops in my eyes.

13:04.993 --> 13:08.353
I don't know what they're for. I'm just doing
what I do in any doctor's waiting room.

13:08.371 --> 13:12.092
I'm catching up on my reading, you know?
<i>People, Time,</i> and <i>Newsweek.</i>

13:12.208 --> 13:14.210
What else do you do
in a doctor's waiting room?

13:14.335 --> 13:16.679
You don't look at the <i>art!</i>

13:16.796 --> 13:19.549
So pretty soon I realize
my pupils are dilating.

13:19.674 --> 13:22.928
She's put drops in my eyes to dilate
my pupils, and I can't read anymore.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.680
I have to put down the books.
I'm going blind in the waiting room.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.682
I'm reduced to waiting.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.310
I'm <i>waiting</i> in the <i>waiting room!</i>

13:30.435 --> 13:33.109
At last the nurse comes in
and leads me in to Dr. Mendel.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.448
Introduces me.
He's a bit of a fuzz ball to me...

13:35.565 --> 13:38.865
but what I do notice is, he's got
this rather large syringe in his hand.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.704
He tells me he's got to shoot me up
with some colored dye.

13:41.821 --> 13:45.075
I think, "Why not?
He's the doctor."

13:45.199 --> 13:47.702
I mean, he's one of these guys
you gotta ask, "Why? What for?

13:47.869 --> 13:51.169
What's going on?" with everything.
So he tells me what he has to do...

13:51.289 --> 13:54.634
is put colored dye in me to highlight
the veins and capillaries in my eye...

13:54.751 --> 13:56.970
and take color photos
of my eye. Fine.

13:57.086 --> 14:00.590
So the nurse puts my chin up on this brace,
and I'm looking into two holes.

14:00.715 --> 14:03.764
Happens to be the camera.
Happens to be a <i>ﬂash</i> camera.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.559
Whoa! I'm pulling back.
The nurse is not holding my hand.

14:06.721 --> 14:09.144
She's pushing my head forward.
It's like a torture.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.064
It's like a <i>Clockwork Orange</i> situation.
All I can see is spots.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.854
I pull away. I see Dr. Mendel
racing across his floor...

14:14.979 --> 14:16.822
gown blowing
in the nonexistent breeze.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.907
He's going off, scribbling madly
in shorthand on a pad...

14:19.025 --> 14:22.029
to develop the photographs,
and I'm sitting there...

14:22.153 --> 14:23.655
waiting.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.373
Dilated and waiting.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.367
Now the nurse is holding my hand,
telling me about...

14:27.492 --> 14:29.711
some package deal she has
to the Bahamas.

14:29.827 --> 14:33.047
At last, Dr. Mendel breezes back
into the room, scribbling on his pad.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.917
He goes past me to the telephone.
Instead of speaking to me...

14:36.084 --> 14:38.212
he calls my ophthalmologist,
Dr. Schecter.

14:38.336 --> 14:41.556
Dr. Schecter isn't in,
so Dr. Mendel leaves a message.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.095
"Hello? Dr. Schecter?

14:44.258 --> 14:46.807
Dr. Mendel here.
First of all, I want to thank you...

14:46.928 --> 14:50.307
for sending over your patient,
Gary Spalding.

14:50.431 --> 14:53.310
Close inspection of the left macula
shows that there is a distortion...

14:53.434 --> 14:54.902
of the interior limiting membrane...

14:55.019 --> 14:57.738
secondary to the posterior
hyaloid-face contraction.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.779
But the posterior hyaloid, which is
attached to the optic nerve macula...

15:00.900 --> 15:04.154
and major vessels of the retina,
have remained attached and intact."

15:04.278 --> 15:07.578
"Uh, Dr. Mandel. Over here, please.
It's me, the patient."

15:07.698 --> 15:10.326
He turns his back to me
and goes on dictating.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.795
"With dissolution
of the central vitreous gel...

15:12.912 --> 15:14.880
the envelope that the vitreous gel
is in begins to shrink...

15:14.997 --> 15:16.544
and distort the surface
of the retina.

15:16.666 --> 15:20.136
A fluorescein angiogram was done to
determine the amount of vascular distortion.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.467
I was surprised to see...

15:22.588 --> 15:26.934
that he has some minimal
cystoid macula edema on that left eye...

15:27.051 --> 15:30.146
on the basis of that capillary
incompetence from that distortion.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.311
Thank you very much."

15:32.432 --> 15:35.402
"Uh, Dr.-Dr. Mendel, please.

15:35.518 --> 15:39.068
What is wrong with my left eye?
Tell me."

15:39.188 --> 15:41.065
"Basically, Gary...

15:41.190 --> 15:43.659
you have a macula pucker."

15:44.902 --> 15:47.496
"A wh-wh-what - A ma-ma-mac-

15:47.655 --> 15:50.329
A macula pucker?
Wh-What is that, Dr. Mendel?"

15:50.491 --> 15:52.835
"Basically what's happened
is that your vitreal gel...

15:52.952 --> 15:55.125
has broken down
and decomposed in your left eye...

15:55.246 --> 15:57.374
and pulled away from the macula...

15:57.498 --> 16:00.458
which is the center of the retina
and responsible for all detail in vision.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.009
Now, the breakdown of the vitreal gel
is not that uncommon.

16:03.171 --> 16:06.846
We find in most autopsies
that the cadaver no longer has a vitreal gel.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.968
In your case
you were less fortunate...

16:09.093 --> 16:11.437
because in pulling away from the macula,
it left a little piece of tissue...

16:11.554 --> 16:13.477
and it's caused
your macula to pucker up.

16:13.598 --> 16:16.192
Think of your retina
as a piece of Saran Wrap bunching.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.483
You have a pucker, Gary.
A pucker."

16:19.604 --> 16:22.608
"But what would cause that?
I can't possibly -

16:22.732 --> 16:24.609
I don't have it happen
in my right eye.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.157
I mean, wh-what would cause
a thing like that?"

16:27.278 --> 16:30.202
"I don't know. Did you have
any trauma to that left eye?"

16:30.323 --> 16:32.542
"Um, I can't think of any.

16:32.700 --> 16:36.125
I mean, the last thing I remember happening
to my left eye was so long ago.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.215
It was 1976, I remember.
It was New Year's Eve.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.380
I was dancing with this woman.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.783
She didn't have a good sense of her own
personal space, if you know what I mean...

16:44.795 --> 16:47.969
and her pinkie shot into my left eye,
and she scratched my cornea.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.468
It was tearing. It was painful.
They put a patch over it."

16:50.593 --> 16:52.391
He just turns to me and says...

16:52.512 --> 16:54.514
"You have a good memory,
don't you, Gary?"

16:54.639 --> 16:56.983
"But is there anything
that could be -

16:57.099 --> 16:59.727
you know, be done for the left eye?
Any corrective measures?"

16:59.894 --> 17:01.737
"Yes, I think so.

17:01.896 --> 17:05.400
I recommend
a little macular scraping."

17:05.525 --> 17:08.243
As soon as I heard
that word "scraping"...

17:08.361 --> 17:10.989
I knew I wanted
a second, third, and fourth opinion.

17:11.113 --> 17:14.458
He tells me, don't bother.
He's the best macular scraper in town.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.499
Up until then, I really didn't like this man.
Now I hated him.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.589
I had no problem walking
right out of that office without any guilt.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.583
I go back and tell Renée
what he said.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.585
She's very upset,
but she's also excited...

17:24.710 --> 17:26.587
because it means she can do research.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.589
It's gonna give her some focus.
She's very good at research.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.593
She wants to find
the best macular scraper in town.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.436
I'm no good at research.
What am I good at? I don't know.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.683
Sitting at my desk and speculating.
Speculating on causes.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.606
Sitting down with my notebook.
"What could have caused this thing?"

17:40.726 --> 17:44.276
Because under no circumstances
do I want it to happen to my right eye.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.775
So I'm sitting there thinking,
"It's my book.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.027
That's it. <i>Impossible Vacation.</i>

17:49.151 --> 17:52.826
Reading over and over that painful section
about my mother's suicide.

17:52.947 --> 17:56.577
I mean, without probably
mourning her or grieving her loss...

17:56.701 --> 17:59.454
it probably made me cry
in one major way.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.877
My eye just exploded.
One big tear."

18:01.998 --> 18:04.998
Then I thought, "No, it's because
I wrote it in the first person - the book.

18:05.126 --> 18:09.131
It was simply too much
'I, I, I, I, I.'"

18:09.297 --> 18:12.426
Then I thought, "No, it's my left brain
rebelling against my right."

18:12.550 --> 18:14.769
Or vice versa,
because I am dyslexic.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.887
Now, whenever I'd ask
any of my New Age friends...

18:17.013 --> 18:19.436
what they thought was going on,
they would say...

18:19.557 --> 18:23.607
"Well, what is it
you don't want to see?"

18:23.728 --> 18:26.106
And I had lists.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.232
Then I thought it was
my Oedipus complex...

18:28.357 --> 18:31.031
because the book <i>Impossible Vacation</i>
was somewhat about that.

18:31.152 --> 18:34.497
Not that I was consciously aware
of ever wanting to sleep with my mother...

18:34.655 --> 18:38.705
but at the time I was writing the book,
I was reading Freud's essay on negation.

18:38.826 --> 18:42.672
And in that essay, Freud says
the denial of some state of affairs...

18:42.788 --> 18:45.132
is the implicit
acknowledgement of it.

18:45.249 --> 18:48.378
So that if a guy says he never
wanted to sleep with his mother...

18:48.502 --> 18:51.676
the chances are he gave it
some solid consideration.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.347
So I'm thinking now the unconscious part
that gave it the solid consideration...

18:55.468 --> 18:59.098
is now reaching up and scratching out
my eyes one at a time...

18:59.221 --> 19:02.100
beginning with my left
and feminine eye.

19:02.224 --> 19:05.478
So that's what I'm doing
with <i>my</i> time!

19:05.603 --> 19:07.480
Meanwhile, while I was
speculating on causes...

19:07.605 --> 19:11.655
Renée was out looking for - and finding -
one of the best macular men around.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.619
A Chinese doctor.
I liked him immediately.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.579
He had a really good
bedside manner.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.573
You know, a smile like Buddha.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.121
Most of these eye doctors
are like automatons.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.210
Also, I liked his language.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.547
Instead of "macular scraping"...

19:24.705 --> 19:29.381
he referred to what had to be done
to my eye as "macular peeling." Right?

19:29.502 --> 19:31.345
Also, he says, "Mr. Gray...

19:31.462 --> 19:34.466
please stop worrying about causes...

19:34.590 --> 19:37.264
because this condition is idiopathic...

19:37.385 --> 19:40.059
meaning 'no known cause.'"

19:40.179 --> 19:42.523
Idiopathic.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.190
He wants me to know all about the operation.
It's a relatively new operation.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.187
It costs $10,000.

19:48.312 --> 19:51.407
It's not guaranteed
to correct my vision, but it could help.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.902
What he has to do
is take a very sharp knife...

19:54.068 --> 19:57.038
and cut my left eye in two places,
two incisions.

19:57.154 --> 20:00.454
Into the first he sticks
a little miniature vacuum cleaner...

20:00.574 --> 20:03.748
a little pump, to suck out
what's left of the vitreal gel.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.039
Then, in he sticks
a teeny little peeler.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.257
Microscopic.
It's microsurgery.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.718
And he peels the retina.

20:10.835 --> 20:13.964
Now, he wants me to know
what risks are involved in the operation...

20:14.088 --> 20:17.683
so I can make an educated choice
and he won't be responsible.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.679
The first risk is
slight chance of infection...

20:20.803 --> 20:23.056
which would mean prosthesis.

20:23.180 --> 20:26.559
Also, he could slip
and tear the retina while peeling...

20:26.684 --> 20:29.779
which would mean
instant blindness in the left eye.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.318
Also, there's a 35 percent chance
of cataract...

20:32.440 --> 20:34.659
due to the trauma from the operation...

20:34.775 --> 20:38.279
and there's a one percent chance
that the whole condition...

20:38.404 --> 20:40.327
will simply clear up on its own...

20:41.449 --> 20:44.123
which I'm banking on.

20:44.285 --> 20:46.458
"But, Mr. Gray," he says, "no rush.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.339
We don't have to operate right away.
I have to check on it every so often.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.425
See how it's progressing.
We can take our time."

20:51.542 --> 20:54.136
"You can?
Well, that's great. You mean -

20:54.253 --> 20:56.096
'Cause I'm not gonna
sit around and wait.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.965
I could try alternatives, right,
while I'm waiting?

20:58.090 --> 21:00.434
Like diet, acupuncture,
prayer, all three?

21:00.551 --> 21:02.269
I could do that, couldn't I?"

21:02.386 --> 21:05.856
"Oh, yes," he says,
with his great Buddha smile.

21:05.973 --> 21:09.568
"Try all the alternatives you want.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.404
Then we'll have to operate."

21:12.521 --> 21:15.149
So I got back home
and told Renée what the doctor said...

21:15.316 --> 21:17.159
and she said, "Spald...

21:17.318 --> 21:19.787
do you know
what 'prosthesis' means?"

21:19.904 --> 21:21.952
And I said, "Um, I think so.

21:22.072 --> 21:25.372
I mean, I thought I knew when I walked
in here, but now I'm a little fuzzy.

21:25.493 --> 21:28.872
Wait a minute. It hasn't got anything
to do with the prostate gland, does it?

21:28.996 --> 21:32.341
No, wait. Doesn't it mean
'false arm' or 'false leg?'"

21:32.458 --> 21:36.759
And Renée says,
"Try 'eye.' Try 'glass eye.'"

21:36.879 --> 21:39.257
Oh, God. I didn't want to go
into a hospital if I could help it.

21:39.381 --> 21:42.421
I didn't want to go in. A friend of mine
around the time this was going on...

21:42.426 --> 21:45.475
went in for a simple gall bladder operation,
into a New York hospital.

21:45.596 --> 21:48.156
The nurse gave him a shot
in the wrong quadrant of his buttock...

21:48.224 --> 21:50.443
and hit his sciatic nerve
and paralyzed his right leg.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.519
Now he's suing the hospital
for a million dollars.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.234
I didn't want to go in!

21:54.355 --> 21:56.904
I had a girlfriend
that was dating her ob-gyn...

21:57.024 --> 22:00.225
and she'd go on these dates to the hospital,
because he had a cubicle with a bed.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.409
He was always waiting
to be called to deliver babies.

22:02.530 --> 22:05.204
And also, she'd go there
because he had access...

22:05.324 --> 22:07.497
to liquid cocaine...

22:07.618 --> 22:11.122
and they would wipe this liquid cocaine
on their genitals and then light a doobie...

22:11.247 --> 22:13.215
and go to town.

22:13.374 --> 22:16.344
And in the middle of this date,
the doctor's beeper would go off...

22:16.460 --> 22:19.260
and he'd jump up stoned with an erection
and go off and deliver a baby.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.386
I didn't want to go in!
I didn't want to!

22:21.549 --> 22:24.644
I didn't want to go into a hospital
if I could help it, please!

22:24.760 --> 22:26.933
Also, what did I know
about hospitals or doctors?

22:27.054 --> 22:31.134
- I grew up as a Christian Scientist.
I had no experience with hospitals or doctors.
<i>- [Birds Chirping ]</i>

22:31.183 --> 22:34.403
Growing up as a Christian Scientist
in Barrington, Rhode Island, was lonely.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.439
There were about six of us:

22:36.564 --> 22:38.765
my three brothers,
a couple of brothers down the street.

22:38.816 --> 22:41.820
There was no church in Barrington.
We had to go to church in Providence.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.163
Basically, my friends treated me
like anyone else...

22:44.280 --> 22:46.248
except in the summertime
they'd get bored...

22:46.365 --> 22:48.288
and kind of back me up
against an elm tree...

22:48.409 --> 22:51.583
and start their own little
Protestant Inquisition by saying...

22:51.745 --> 22:54.669
"You're a Christian Scientist, right?"
"That's right."

22:54.790 --> 22:58.090
"That means you don't believe in doctors?"
"Uh, that's right."

22:58.252 --> 23:00.971
- "Uh, say lightning hit this tree now...
<i>- [ Thunder]</i>

23:01.088 --> 23:03.932
And a branch cracked, came down,
hit your head, and your brains were
drooling all over the grass.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.719
Would you go to a doctor then?"
"No."

23:06.844 --> 23:09.472
"Uh, say you're walking across the street,
and a cement mixer...

23:09.597 --> 23:12.942
- squished and pulverized the whole
lower part of your body into the pavement.
<i>- [ Splattering Sounds ]</i>

23:13.058 --> 23:16.278
Would you go to a doctor then?"
"No."

23:16.395 --> 23:19.023
"Uh...

23:19.148 --> 23:21.776
say the North Koreans invaded
Barrington, Rhode Island...

23:21.901 --> 23:24.620
- and they took a cage of starving rats
and put them up to your ass...
<i>- [ Rats Squeaking ]</i>

23:24.737 --> 23:26.857
and the rats started eating
up through into your body.

23:26.864 --> 23:29.663
Would you go to a doctor then?"
"No!'"

23:29.783 --> 23:32.502
So I began to feel my friends
had a death wish for me.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.499
I mean, it kind of put me
on the outside of the community.

23:35.623 --> 23:37.876
I did have some healings, though.
I remember-

23:38.000 --> 23:40.094
I'm trying to think of one
I can tell you - share with you.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.804
Oh, I know.
When I was in seventh grade...

23:42.963 --> 23:45.887
one morning I woke up
with this little, like, piece of flesh...

23:46.008 --> 23:49.262
growing off the end of my nose,
like a little flesh stalactite...

23:49.386 --> 23:53.266
and it kept growing, and my friends
kept looking at me and saying...

23:53.390 --> 23:55.313
"Ya got some snot on your nose."

23:55.434 --> 23:59.189
And I'd say, "It's not snot.

23:59.313 --> 24:01.361
It's not."

24:01.482 --> 24:03.484
So I wanted to have it
burned off, cauterized.

24:03.651 --> 24:06.325
I wanted to go to a doctor.
Have a quickie. Bypass prayer.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.698
So I went to my mother and asked her
if she would take me, and she said...

24:08.822 --> 24:10.574
"Spuddy, dear, no. Please.

24:10.699 --> 24:14.203
Let's let the Christian Science
practitioner pray for it first."

24:14.328 --> 24:17.798
So I had to do it.
What can I say? She had the car.

24:17.915 --> 24:20.634
So we all began praying.
I was praying for the little thing to drop off.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.628
She was praying
it would drop off.

24:22.753 --> 24:25.222
The Christian Science practitioner
was praying for it to drop off.

24:25.339 --> 24:27.012
But it didn't drop off.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.774
At the end of the week, I said,
"Can I go to the doctor now, Mom?"

24:29.843 --> 24:33.438
And she said, "Give it one more day.
Please, dear, one more day."

24:33.555 --> 24:36.058
Well, I had to give it one more day,
because on that particular day -

24:36.183 --> 24:38.543
it was a Monday -
I was being tutored in seventh-grade math.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.479
I was failing seventh-grade math.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.484
I remember my tutor was
this nice older woman...

24:42.606 --> 24:44.483
and she kept looking at my nose.

24:44.608 --> 24:48.329
And she finally said, [Granny Voice ]
"Looks like you could use a hankie."

24:48.445 --> 24:50.743
So I tried to humor her.
I took her lace handkerchief...

24:50.864 --> 24:52.787
wiped my nose, and...

24:53.867 --> 24:55.915
off it came!

24:56.036 --> 24:57.913
[Chuckles]
So...

24:58.038 --> 25:02.088
keeping this healing in mind,
I decided for my first alternative...

25:02.209 --> 25:04.337
I would try calling
a Christian Science practitioner.

25:04.461 --> 25:07.761
I'd never called one before.
My mom always had.

25:07.881 --> 25:10.430
So I remember
I was touring in London.

25:10.551 --> 25:14.146
I was in London, and I got the name
of a practitioner in San Francisco.

25:14.263 --> 25:16.607
Now, I thought, "The power of prayer
can go around the world, they say.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.726
Maybe it'll go halfway."
So I call up.

25:18.892 --> 25:22.292
Now, when you call a Christian Science
practitioner, you're not supposed to mention...

25:22.354 --> 25:24.527
any disease names.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.742
It gives it power.
Don't name the condition.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.403
Just refer to it as an "error."

25:29.528 --> 25:31.496
So needless to say,
there's a lot of innuendo...

25:31.613 --> 25:33.661
that goes around that word "error."

25:33.782 --> 25:36.911
Is it a <i>b-i-i-i-g</i> error, as in cancer?

25:37.077 --> 25:39.375
A little error? Cold.
Medium error? Flu.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.816
But I jumped right in and started
describing the condition.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.759
"Hello? This is Spalding Gray
calling from London...

25:44.918 --> 25:46.920
and I have an eye condition.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.344
My left eye is totally blurry.
They're calling it -"

25:49.465 --> 25:52.139
"I think we've heard
just about enough, Mr. Gray.

25:52.259 --> 25:55.604
Now, first of all, I would like you to go
to a Christian Science reading room...

25:55.721 --> 25:59.225
and look up Mary Baker Eddy's book
<i>Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.</i>

25:59.349 --> 26:03.525
Look up "The Perfection of Eyes,"
page 624 and 625.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.898
I will also send you some information.

26:06.023 --> 26:08.025
Now, I want to ask you:

26:08.150 --> 26:10.699
Are you faithful?"

26:10.819 --> 26:14.699
"Oh- uh- you mean,
am I filled with faith?"

26:14.823 --> 26:18.453
"No. Are you seeing
anyone else?

26:18.619 --> 26:20.963
Any doctors?"

26:21.080 --> 26:23.128
"Oh, I see what you mean.

26:23.290 --> 26:26.920
Well, uh, there's this Chinese guy,
but it's nothing serious.

26:27.044 --> 26:29.513
I mean, once a month
I check in with him -"

26:29.630 --> 26:33.430
"I'm afraid we can't work that way.
We can't be duplicitous in our faith.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.303
You have to choose me or the doctor.
So you think it over.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.643
You can get back to me anytime.
I'll be here.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.766
God bless."

26:40.891 --> 26:42.768
And he hangs up...

26:42.893 --> 26:45.316
and I realized at that moment...

26:45.437 --> 26:48.281
why it was I had left
Christian Science.

26:48.398 --> 26:52.278
So I went to my therapist
to talk to him about my eye condition.

26:52.402 --> 26:55.656
My therapist
was a graduate of Auschwitz...

26:55.781 --> 26:58.955
so he was an existential realist.

26:59.076 --> 27:02.797
And I told him the story,
and he listened and then said...

27:02.913 --> 27:07.134
[ Deep, Accented Voice ]
"Spalding - Spalding, please, please.

27:08.293 --> 27:11.046
All things are contingent...

27:11.171 --> 27:14.721
and there is also chaos.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.640
In other words...

27:16.760 --> 27:18.603
shit happens.

27:18.720 --> 27:22.975
Please, give up
this magical-thinking business, huh?

27:23.100 --> 27:26.024
Airy-fairy, Disneyland, Tinker Bell...

27:26.186 --> 27:29.235
<i>Angels in America</i> nonsense, please.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.779
Do the right thing.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.198
Get the operation."

27:35.571 --> 27:37.539
So he was no help.

27:38.699 --> 27:42.124
<i>So I walk out of my therapist's office
doing my New York walking blues.</i>

27:42.244 --> 27:44.246
I've got a ratty old overcoat...

27:44.371 --> 27:46.749
and I haven't shaved in four days,
and I'm hunched over.

27:46.874 --> 27:49.468
I don't care where I'm walking.
I'm just walking...

27:49.585 --> 27:51.553
and I'm thinking, "How?

27:51.670 --> 27:55.095
How could I allow someone
to cut into my eye with a knife?

27:55.215 --> 27:57.559
Cut into the window to my soul?"

27:57.676 --> 27:59.553
And why - why this affliction?

27:59.678 --> 28:02.932
Of all the things -
losing the detail in my vision.

28:03.056 --> 28:06.936
I mean, I totally depend on seeing
the detail in order to tell stories.

28:07.060 --> 28:10.781
I'm not making any of this up. I mean,
don't you think I'd rather sit at home...

28:10.898 --> 28:12.775
<i>and be able to make things up?</i>

28:12.900 --> 28:14.902
<i>It'd be so much less
wear and tear on my body.</i>

28:15.068 --> 28:16.945
<i>But I'm thinking,
"I need my right eye."</i>

28:17.070 --> 28:19.414
What would happen
if I went blind in my right eye?

28:19.531 --> 28:22.751
I mean, what would I become?
A blind poet in New York City?

28:22.910 --> 28:25.663
I hate poetry,"
I'm thinking as I'm walking.

28:25.787 --> 28:28.131
And I find I'm walking now
in the Bowery...

28:28.248 --> 28:30.296
which is fine,
because I feel like...

28:30.417 --> 28:33.921
I belong there at this point,
and a bunch of prostitutes are on the street.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.219
You know,
the kind that just trick out of cars?

28:36.340 --> 28:38.968
And they're paying no attention to me.
I'm walking on by.

28:39.092 --> 28:41.971
In fact, they're rushing over
to an old black Pontiac...

28:42.095 --> 28:45.941
I see pulling up to the curb there
out of the corner of my good eye.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.060
They're rushing over like-like -

28:48.185 --> 28:50.233
like a bunch of prostitutes, really.

28:50.354 --> 28:53.153
And they get over to the car,
and one of them turns and yells...

28:53.273 --> 28:55.776
"Hey, yo, boy! Over here!

28:55.901 --> 28:58.074
They want you!"

28:59.529 --> 29:01.907
And I turned...

29:02.032 --> 29:03.784
because I'm curious...

29:04.826 --> 29:07.295
and I love to be wanted.

29:07.454 --> 29:10.503
And I walk over,
and the prostitutes part like the Red Sea...

29:10.624 --> 29:12.752
and I walk up
to this old black Pontiac...

29:12.876 --> 29:14.878
and it's got three Hasidic Jews in it -

29:15.003 --> 29:16.880
two in the front, one in the back.

29:17.005 --> 29:19.224
And they say, "Get in."

29:20.842 --> 29:22.344
And I do...

29:22.469 --> 29:24.471
because I'm curious...

29:24.638 --> 29:26.982
and I love to be wanted.

29:27.140 --> 29:31.190
So I get in the back with the youngest,
and they drive off down the Bowery.

29:31.311 --> 29:35.361
The prostitutes are yelling,
"Bye! Have a good trick!"

29:35.482 --> 29:37.701
So I don't know -
Where are they taking me, I ask.

29:37.818 --> 29:40.492
They tell me they're taking me
over to Williamsburg.

29:40.654 --> 29:43.658
I think, "Well, why not?
I've never been to Williamsburg.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.830
Why not take a tour?
Williamsburg.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.045
Go with the chosen people."

29:48.161 --> 29:50.414
So by now, anyway,
I'm telling them my name is Peter.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.507
I say I'm a drifter from Schenectady.

29:52.666 --> 29:55.666
I'm kind of just making myself up.
Tired of the old Spalding Gray, you know?

29:55.669 --> 29:58.513
"Peter with perfect eyes"
kind of concept.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.766
And they're saying,
do I want anything to eat?

30:00.882 --> 30:04.182
They want to buy pizza and beer for me.
I say, "No, no, thank you.

30:04.344 --> 30:07.143
I've just eaten,
and I don't drink before 5:00."

30:07.264 --> 30:09.938
So over the bridge we go.
Pull up in front of a synagogue.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.481
I go with the ﬂow.
I follow the three of them in.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.479
We go into this old synagogue.

30:14.604 --> 30:16.481
Other Hasidic Jews are in there...

30:16.606 --> 30:18.859
mending the bindings
of old books and looking up...

30:19.026 --> 30:20.903
and winking at me
like little Santa Clauses.

30:21.028 --> 30:23.702
I follow the driver of the car
into the kitchen.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.041
He gets out a couple
of plastic garbage bags...

30:26.199 --> 30:28.122
a rake, a shovel, a broom...

30:28.243 --> 30:31.042
opens the back door,
referring me out to the backyard...

30:31.204 --> 30:33.047
says, "Please.

30:33.206 --> 30:35.800
Go. Clean."

30:35.917 --> 30:38.386
So, hey, I knew I could just say
I was Spalding Gray...

30:38.545 --> 30:40.718
and drop everything and walk away,
but I didn't.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.804
I continued to be Peter.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.097
And I walked down
into that backyard...

30:45.218 --> 30:47.937
and I took the rake,
and I began to rake.

30:48.055 --> 30:51.935
I'm raking up all these broken
plastic knives and forks and paper plates...

30:52.059 --> 30:54.653
and things left over from parties
and wet leaves.

30:54.770 --> 30:57.774
I'm doing a good job.
In fact, I feel this energy. Mm!

30:57.898 --> 31:01.744
This raking energy I haven't felt
since I was a kid in my father's yard.

31:01.902 --> 31:05.406
I'm doing such a good job, I could feel
these muscles in here getting strong again.

31:05.572 --> 31:08.451
I'm doing such a good job, a woman
that lives behind the synagogue...

31:08.575 --> 31:10.919
throws up her window and says,
"Yo, boy! Hey!

31:11.078 --> 31:13.501
You work good. You come here next?
How much you charge?"

31:13.622 --> 31:16.171
I said, "No, no, no.
I'm all booked up. Sorry."

31:16.291 --> 31:19.545
About an hour's time
I got all the leaves in the bag, tied up.

31:19.669 --> 31:21.592
The driver of the car
walks out on the porch...

31:21.755 --> 31:24.349
looks over,
peruses the backyard, says...

31:24.466 --> 31:28.016
"Very good.
You work very good.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.559
You are the hardest-working
Bowery bum...

31:30.680 --> 31:32.978
we've ever picked up.

31:33.100 --> 31:35.944
Usually they come here,
they work for drinks.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.938
You don't seem to drink...

31:38.063 --> 31:40.236
so I suppose we must
pay you something."

31:40.357 --> 31:43.657
"Yes. I suppose so."

31:43.777 --> 31:46.075
"Mm, eight dollars."

31:46.196 --> 31:49.291
"No, no. Ten. Even up in Schenectady,
it's ten dollars an hour.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.292
I've been out here an hour."

31:51.451 --> 31:55.456
"Mm, eight plus carfare."

31:55.622 --> 31:58.842
"Uh, no. Ten, and I'll walk."

31:58.959 --> 32:00.961
Here it is - a Scot and a Jew
haggling it out...

32:01.086 --> 32:03.339
in the backyard of a synagogue.

32:03.463 --> 32:05.761
I get the ten dollars, and I walk.

32:05.882 --> 32:08.806
Triumphantly across the Brooklyn Bridge
I'm walking, thinking...

32:08.927 --> 32:10.804
"Hey, look at that.

32:10.929 --> 32:14.433
There is something I can do
if I go blind in my right eye."

32:16.351 --> 32:18.649
So shortly after this,
there was a reunion call...

32:18.770 --> 32:21.239
for the storytelling workshop
that I did in upstate...

32:21.356 --> 32:23.358
and it was to be held
in New York City.

32:23.483 --> 32:25.656
I wasn't sure if I was going to go...

32:25.777 --> 32:27.745
and then I thought,
I'd better go...

32:27.863 --> 32:30.867
because maybe Azaria Thornbird
would show up...

32:30.991 --> 32:33.335
and I really wanted to see
Azaria again.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.546
I- I want to try to describe her.

32:35.662 --> 32:38.541
It's hard to get words
around this woman.

32:38.665 --> 32:42.169
All right. She lives outside Minneapolis.
She's a single mother.

32:42.335 --> 32:44.576
Has two sons she raised.
I think she did a very good job.

32:44.671 --> 32:47.345
I've met them.
They're nine and 11 years old.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.015
And the only kind of odd thing
for Azaria is that...

32:50.177 --> 32:52.646
she happened to be
a sorcerer's apprentice.

32:52.762 --> 32:56.517
She trained with this sorcerer,
Everet K. Whiteowl...

32:56.641 --> 32:59.269
who's part Welsh and part
Native American Indian...

32:59.394 --> 33:02.898
and he trains out in the desert
outside Los Angeles...

33:03.023 --> 33:05.526
in what I refer to as
"Manson country."

33:05.650 --> 33:08.153
And she was going out to do
these very esoteric trainings...

33:08.278 --> 33:11.623
in astral projection,
lucid dream state...

33:11.740 --> 33:15.870
the Breath of Fire, which she's teaching
to women in the Minneapolis area now...

33:15.994 --> 33:20.841
and then - oh, the American Indian
tantric sexual initiations.

33:20.957 --> 33:23.255
The Quidoshka trainings, right?

33:23.376 --> 33:26.755
Which she was about to be initiated to
and he was doing with women out there...

33:26.880 --> 33:29.804
but she couldn't get out to do it
because she was running out of airfare.

33:29.925 --> 33:31.973
She couldn't afford
to fly out anymore.

33:32.093 --> 33:35.017
So what she told me she did -
Now, I believed this when she told it to me.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.391
I was very convinced.
She said she would go to sleep at night...

33:37.557 --> 33:39.400
in her bed in Minneapolis...

33:39.559 --> 33:42.859
and out of her corporeal body
would rise this astral body.

33:42.979 --> 33:45.140
She'd go into a lucid dream state
and astral-project...

33:45.232 --> 33:48.112
and up would come this astral body,
and it would go and mingle and mix...

33:48.235 --> 33:50.579
around various Indian grandmothers
in the living room...

33:50.695 --> 33:54.495
and then go upstairs and meet
Everet K. Whiteowl's astral body...

33:54.616 --> 33:57.415
and they would have
their Quidoshka workshop...

33:57.536 --> 33:59.630
and - zoop! -
save money on airfare.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.623
And - thoop! -
soon as they finished...

34:01.748 --> 34:04.001
Everet K.'s astral body
would go "whoop!" back to the desert...

34:04.125 --> 34:05.843
faster than American Airlines...

34:05.961 --> 34:08.259
and Azaria's would go "whoop!"
back into her corporeal body...

34:08.380 --> 34:10.257
and she'd wake up in one body.

34:10.422 --> 34:12.641
So I say, "Azaria...

34:12.759 --> 34:15.478
you mean to say
you have two bodies -

34:15.594 --> 34:17.554
one that can stand up
and look back at the other -

34:17.639 --> 34:19.607
and you've never tried
to make love to yourself?"

34:19.766 --> 34:21.438
I mean, that's the first thing
that would occur to me...

34:21.601 --> 34:23.603
before I'd go mixing
with Indian grandmothers.

34:23.728 --> 34:27.449
Please myself. She says
it never occurred to her. Never.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.570
And then she says
she tried it and it worked.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.536
So she was very open.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.452
Now, what she did
show me, actually...

34:34.572 --> 34:36.792
that I did see happen
was this Breath of Fire.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.467
Now, this is an extraordinary thing.
I mean, where I come from...

34:39.494 --> 34:42.373
women 200 years ago would've been
burned at the stake for doing this.

34:42.496 --> 34:45.216
She lay on the floor,
and without touching herself once...

34:45.333 --> 34:49.213
she had about eight classic
Reichian orgasms.

34:49.337 --> 34:52.090
She came from her toes to her nose.
It was like...

34:52.215 --> 34:55.094
[ Orgasmic Moaning ]

34:55.217 --> 34:58.973
I'm just sitting there going,
"Teach me, teach me, teach me!

34:59.139 --> 35:02.814
Do you know how many lonely hotels
and motels I stay in across America?

35:02.934 --> 35:04.974
If I could come like that
without touching myself...

35:04.978 --> 35:08.482
I'd be a happy man -
or at least content."

35:08.648 --> 35:11.322
So she tells me
I have to lie on the floor, right?

35:11.484 --> 35:13.737
And I have to suck
the energy in the room -

35:13.862 --> 35:17.412
"energy," whatever that is -
into the base of my spine.

35:17.532 --> 35:20.251
Through what hole,
I don't know.

35:20.368 --> 35:22.245
So I'm doing a lot of visualization.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.418
I see energy as these pink balls
of cotton candy...

35:24.539 --> 35:26.416
kind of floating around aimlessly...

35:26.541 --> 35:29.420
and as far as the hole in my spine,
I see my coccyx...

35:29.544 --> 35:31.421
as hollow, with a little cork in it.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.799
[ Makes Popping Sound ]
I take out the cork, and I begin to suck.

35:33.923 --> 35:35.846
[Slurping ]

35:37.927 --> 35:40.100
I mean, really,
the closest I could get...

35:40.221 --> 35:42.895
was a sense of reverse farting.

35:43.016 --> 35:47.021
[ Exhales ] All I'm trying to say is
she's an interesting woman.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.490
And she did show up at the workshop.
I couldn't look her in the face, though.

35:50.607 --> 35:52.687
And I couldn't stop talking
about my eye operation...

35:52.692 --> 35:54.615
how I was gonna get it
or not get it...

35:54.736 --> 35:56.704
and I kept deflecting,
and she said, "Spalding...

35:56.863 --> 35:58.957
do not go to a hospital
for an operation.

35:59.074 --> 36:00.872
Listen to me.
Come out to Minneapolis...

36:01.034 --> 36:03.114
and we'll have
a Native American sweat lodge for you.

36:03.203 --> 36:05.501
And the power of our prayer -
it's larger than one-on-one.

36:05.622 --> 36:08.501
It's a group. You must come."
"All right. I'll try to."

36:08.625 --> 36:10.593
"No. Look me in the face
and tell me you'll come."

36:10.710 --> 36:13.384
"Well, I'll give it a try."
"No. Look me in the eyes now."

36:13.505 --> 36:15.473
I look her in the face,
and her entire face...

36:15.590 --> 36:18.059
begins to drool
and peel down off of her skull...

36:18.218 --> 36:21.142
and I say, "Stop it! Whatever
you're doing with your face, don't do it!

36:21.262 --> 36:24.607
It makes me nauseous.
Please stop it. I'll come, all right?

36:24.724 --> 36:26.601
I will come out to Minneapolis.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.694
I'll do it. I'll come."

36:28.812 --> 36:32.316
I think I would try
an Indian sweat ceremony.

36:32.440 --> 36:35.990
I don't think it could be much stranger
than my trip to the hypnotherapist.

36:36.111 --> 36:40.332
And maybe it'd be more successful.
Who knows?

36:40.448 --> 36:42.325
I don't think so.

36:42.450 --> 36:45.374
An Indian sweat ceremony?
Never heard of it.

36:45.495 --> 36:47.463
That's a pretty mystic idea.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.834
An Indian sweat ceremony?

36:50.959 --> 36:53.007
It sounds interesting,
but I don't think so.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.631
I wouldn't like to participate
in an Indian sweat lodge...

36:55.755 --> 36:57.803
because it's a dark place
full of smoke...

36:57.924 --> 36:59.892
and it's too damn hot for me.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.979
Uh, an Indian sweat ceremony
could be interesting...

37:03.096 --> 37:05.565
especially if you're gonna be around...

37:05.682 --> 37:08.652
female Indians sweating.

37:08.768 --> 37:12.648
<i>[ Spalding ] Minneapolis in winter.
Perfect time to sweat.</i>

37:12.772 --> 37:15.116
<i>I'm glad I went out.
It was really interesting.</i>

37:15.233 --> 37:19.283
She had about 15 followers,
all practicing these Native American rituals.

37:19.404 --> 37:23.204
She started out by doing
the peace-pipe ritual in a barn.

37:23.324 --> 37:25.247
It was very cold. Very cold.

37:25.368 --> 37:27.541
She's calling the spirits
from the four directions.

37:27.662 --> 37:30.711
Then she takes us outside.
The sweat lodge is all built.

37:30.832 --> 37:33.255
If you've never seen one -
traditional Indian sweat lodge -

37:33.376 --> 37:36.004
it's a low dome made by saplings...

37:36.129 --> 37:38.131
that are all interwoven...

37:38.256 --> 37:41.806
and over it, the Indians would put
animal skins, buffalo skins.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.975
In this case, they had blue plastic
and canvas tarpaulin.

37:45.096 --> 37:48.521
And, oh, the fire. The fire keeper had
the fire going since 6:00 in the morning...

37:48.641 --> 37:51.190
so the rocks were very hot
to make the steam.

37:51.311 --> 37:53.530
We go out, we're standing there
knee-deep in snow...

37:53.646 --> 37:55.944
and Azaria says,
"All right, take off your clothes...

37:56.065 --> 37:57.942
and throw them in the snow,"
and we do it.

37:58.067 --> 38:00.820
We do whatever she says.
Now we're standing naked...

38:00.987 --> 38:04.161
knee-deep, naked in the snow,
like these freezing refugees...

38:04.324 --> 38:06.827
and we have to line up
to go in the sweat lodge.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.745
Well, I'm in fourth place...

38:08.870 --> 38:11.089
as quick as I can get over there
in the line, and I'm looking around...

38:11.206 --> 38:13.334
and I notice,
all these people around me -

38:13.458 --> 38:15.426
there are no Native Americans there.

38:15.543 --> 38:18.217
Basically, they look Swedish.

38:18.338 --> 38:21.262
So we're told that before
we're to go into the sweat lodge...

38:21.382 --> 38:25.353
we have to cry out to the sky the phrase
"All my ancestors."

38:25.470 --> 38:28.019
So we're ready. First person -
"All my ancestors."

38:28.181 --> 38:30.559
"All my ancestors."
"All my ancestors." They're in.

38:30.683 --> 38:33.527
Comes my turn. I go,
"All my ancestors"...

38:33.645 --> 38:36.489
and I start in the sweat lodge,
and I stop and I think, "Wait a minute.

38:36.606 --> 38:39.325
'All my ancestors'?
Now, who were they?"

38:39.442 --> 38:41.319
Because my father
had just finished the family tree...

38:41.444 --> 38:44.539
and I remembered going over it,
and I remembered some of the names:

38:44.697 --> 38:46.119
John Proctor...

38:46.241 --> 38:50.462
the Right Reverend Curtis Fox Gray
and his wife, Thankful Atherton Gray...

38:50.578 --> 38:54.378
Colonel Simeon Spalding,
Captain Edward Spalding...

38:54.541 --> 38:57.260
Brigadier General John Crane...

38:57.377 --> 39:00.722
the only man wounded
at the Boston Tea Party.

39:00.880 --> 39:05.386
And I think, all my ancestors?
Who were they? Pilgrims.

39:05.552 --> 39:08.396
What did they do shortly after
they came to America?

39:08.513 --> 39:10.390
Kill the Indians.

39:10.557 --> 39:14.357
Where was I going?
An Indian sweat lodge.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.696
Good luck.

39:16.813 --> 39:19.487
Ooh, and I go into the tent.
It's not warm in there.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.701
It's not even hot in any way.

39:21.818 --> 39:23.991
It's musty, cold, dank, dark.

39:24.112 --> 39:27.366
There's about 15 of us, men and women,
naked, sitting in a circle on top of hay...

39:27.490 --> 39:29.242
which is on top of the snow.

39:29.409 --> 39:31.449
And Azaria starts telling us
what's going to happen.

39:31.452 --> 39:34.376
She says there'll be
four rounds of prayers.

39:34.497 --> 39:37.250
The first round
will be to set intention.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.966
Prayer for intention or attitude -
what we want to maintain...

39:40.086 --> 39:42.589
throughout the whole ceremony,
which could be anywhere from...

39:42.714 --> 39:44.933
two and a half, three hours, you know -
you just never know.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.893
And then the second round
of prayers will be...

39:48.011 --> 39:50.309
the prayers for friends
and loved ones.

39:50.430 --> 39:52.524
Then the third round -
which is very important -

39:52.640 --> 39:55.234
the third round is that
we give away or renounce...

39:55.351 --> 39:58.355
anything we're attached
that we no longer want to be attached to -

39:58.479 --> 40:01.278
you know, like, say,
<i>an eye condition.</i>

40:01.441 --> 40:04.285
Now - "But this is very important,"
she says.

40:04.444 --> 40:07.618
"On the third round,
do not in any way, please,

40:07.780 --> 40:09.623
take on
the other person's giveaway.

40:09.782 --> 40:12.786
Don't identify with whatever the pathology is
that's being passed around.

40:12.952 --> 40:16.627
Just let it go right out through the tent,
please, or you could be very sick."

40:16.748 --> 40:19.046
And the fourth round
is not exactly a round of prayers...

40:19.167 --> 40:21.215
but what happens is,
hot rocks are brought in...

40:21.336 --> 40:24.931
and then she pours cold water over them,
and we just sit and listen to them steam.

40:25.048 --> 40:28.222
And if we listen very carefully,
you see, these rocks may give...

40:28.343 --> 40:30.846
valuable information, all right?

40:30.970 --> 40:34.474
Now, before we begin, what we have
to say is, the procedure is this:

40:34.641 --> 40:37.520
We have to say,
"O Great Spirit, my name is -"

40:37.644 --> 40:39.942
Then you state your name,
you do your prayer, and then you say...

40:40.063 --> 40:42.612
"I have spoken" to indicate
that the next person can go...

40:42.732 --> 40:45.076
and I do hope it goes smoothly
'cause there are quite a few of us.

40:45.193 --> 40:47.446
And in the fire keeper brings
the first hot rocks...

40:47.570 --> 40:50.244
and pours them in the pit,
and Azaria pours the cold water...

40:50.365 --> 40:52.834
and - [Imitates Steam Hissing ]
Whoa! Whoo!

40:52.992 --> 40:55.745
Steam starts coming up,
and it's hot, let me tell you.

40:55.870 --> 40:59.465
Across my chest I can feel it.
I think, "It could get very warm in here."

40:59.582 --> 41:02.381
And the first rounds of prayers
start out slowly...

41:02.502 --> 41:04.300
<i>rounds of first intention.</i>

41:04.420 --> 41:08.300
"O Great Spirit,
my name is Shelly...

41:08.424 --> 41:11.678
and I pray that I can maintain
a sincere and open attitude...

41:11.844 --> 41:14.723
during this sacred ceremony.
I have spoken."

41:14.847 --> 41:17.521
"O Great Spirit, my name is Seth...

41:17.642 --> 41:19.940
and I pray that I can maintain...

41:20.061 --> 41:22.439
a humble attitude
during this sacred ceremony.

41:22.563 --> 41:24.156
I have spoken."

41:24.273 --> 41:27.072
"O Great Spirit,
this is Spalding speaking...

41:27.193 --> 41:30.572
and I pray I can maintain
a sincere and open attitude...

41:30.697 --> 41:33.075
during this sacred ceremony
and not pollute it...

41:33.199 --> 41:36.328
with my heady analysis
and ironic commentary...

41:36.452 --> 41:40.047
and end up turning this sacred event
into just another story...

41:40.164 --> 41:42.917
I will try to sell
to the American public.

41:43.042 --> 41:44.840
I have spoken."

41:44.961 --> 41:49.011
And everyone in the tent goes,
"Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho"...

41:49.132 --> 41:52.136
which I take to be a kind of
cheerleading attitude to say...

41:52.260 --> 41:55.059
"Hey, let's see if you can
pull that one off."

41:56.264 --> 41:58.733
More hot rocks are brought in.
We're going into round two.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.569
We're praying for friends and loved ones.
Oh, man, it's steaming up!

42:01.686 --> 42:03.688
I can't even see across
the other side of the tent.

42:03.813 --> 42:06.908
People are groaning, down on their sides.
I'm getting down on my side...

42:07.025 --> 42:10.245
trying to breathe some fresh air in
under where the tent hits the ground.

42:10.361 --> 42:13.331
And we're praying for friends
and loved ones. I pray for Renée.

42:13.448 --> 42:16.048
I pray that at last she'll get
a Hollywood film script to write...

42:16.117 --> 42:18.119
that she really likes,
that will be funny...

42:18.244 --> 42:20.292
that will pay her well and <i>get made.</i>

42:20.413 --> 42:22.916
And I pray for friends with AIDS.

42:23.082 --> 42:25.210
"Ploo!" Oh, boy!
More hot rocks are brought in.

42:25.334 --> 42:28.429
We're going into round three.
We're gonna do the giveaway...

42:28.588 --> 42:30.636
and I'm down
on my side now, panting.

42:30.757 --> 42:33.180
All I can think of
is my health club in New York City.

42:33.301 --> 42:35.679
I see in my mind's eye
the sign for the steam room:

42:35.803 --> 42:38.898
"Do not exceed ten minutes
under any circumstances."

42:39.015 --> 42:41.894
And I think, "Whoo!
Who is this Azaria Thornbird?

42:42.018 --> 42:43.895
So her head turned
into a ball of white light.

42:44.020 --> 42:45.897
Does that mean
she's not trying to kill me?"

42:46.022 --> 42:47.740
And people are down
on the ground, praying.

42:47.857 --> 42:51.487
"O Great Spirit, my name is Shelly. I want
to give away my pride. I have spoken."

42:51.611 --> 42:53.739
"O Great Spirit, my name is Seth...

42:53.863 --> 42:56.412
and I want to give away
my macho attitude. I have spoken."

42:56.532 --> 43:00.253
"O Great Spirit, this is Tyrus. I want to give
away my craving for caffeine. I have spoken."

43:00.369 --> 43:02.121
"O Great Spirit, my name is Ingrid.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.749
I want to give away my gluttony.
I have spoken."

43:04.874 --> 43:07.468
"O Great Spirit,
this is Spalding speaking...

43:07.627 --> 43:11.257
and I want to give away the fear that I'm
about to have a heart attack at any minute!"

43:11.380 --> 43:14.179
And just as I say that, a guy next to me
about my age with a beard...

43:14.300 --> 43:16.553
grabs his chest and goes,
"My hear': is popping!

43:16.677 --> 43:18.475
My heart is popping!
My heart is popping!"

43:18.596 --> 43:21.475
And he runs out of the sweat tent.
And I'm fine.

43:21.599 --> 43:25.229
He just took all my fear
and ran right out the door with it.

43:25.353 --> 43:29.733
Azaria says, "Someone has broken
the sacred circle here. Do you hear me?

43:29.857 --> 43:33.111
No one is to leave this sweat lodge
in the middle of the ceremony.

43:33.236 --> 43:35.659
Now we are about to sit here
and listen to the hot rocks steam...

43:35.780 --> 43:37.407
and possibly talk.

43:37.532 --> 43:40.706
If you feel you have to go, go now,
but as soon as that tent flap is closed...

43:40.827 --> 43:42.670
no one leaves."

43:42.787 --> 43:46.542
Now, I am both very claustrophobic
and find it difficult to take orders...

43:46.666 --> 43:49.920
but I am determined
to get through this sweat ceremony.

43:50.044 --> 43:54.265
I just hope that the hot rocks
don't talk too long.

43:54.382 --> 43:57.226
The fire keeper brings the hot rocks in,
puts them in the pit.

43:57.343 --> 43:59.391
Azaria pours the cold water over.

43:59.512 --> 44:02.311
Just as she does this, one of
her members of her lodge jumps up...

44:02.431 --> 44:05.230
a guy with a ponytail down to his ass,
rushes for the door.

44:05.351 --> 44:08.150
Azaria hurls her naked body
in front of him and yells...

44:08.271 --> 44:10.865
"Get back, Lame Deer!
Get back!"

44:10.982 --> 44:14.407
He falls back on the hay, going,
"Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Shit!"

44:14.527 --> 44:17.531
Everyone else is going,
"Ho, ho, ho...

44:17.697 --> 44:20.246
ho, ho, ho?

44:20.366 --> 44:22.246
They're "ho-ing" him.
They're "ho-ing" him down.

44:22.368 --> 44:24.917
"Ho, ho."

44:26.372 --> 44:29.376
And at last,
we sit there in silence...

44:29.542 --> 44:32.386
and listen to the hot rocks steam.

44:39.385 --> 44:41.888
And I didn't understand a word.

44:43.598 --> 44:46.898
And I stepped out of that sweat lodge,
and I felt triumphant.

44:47.059 --> 44:48.902
I'd made it through.
I don't know how long I'd been in there.

44:49.061 --> 44:52.110
Two and a half, three hours?
The sun was going down...

44:52.231 --> 44:55.861
like a - like a big... sun,
like a big red sun...

44:55.985 --> 44:58.534
casting rivers of red
across a crusty white snow.

44:58.654 --> 45:00.873
I could've rolled in that snow
in my new naked body.

45:00.990 --> 45:04.335
I'm standing there, I'm feeling
this internal heat pouring out...

45:04.452 --> 45:07.581
and Azaria comes over and says,
"Spalding, what is wrong with you?"

45:07.705 --> 45:10.174
"Nothing. What are you talking about?
I feel great."

45:10.291 --> 45:14.467
"No. When the time came for you
to talk about your eye condition...

45:14.587 --> 45:17.511
you began babbling
about a heart attack!"

45:17.632 --> 45:20.101
"Oh. Oh - Oh.

45:20.259 --> 45:21.852
Oh, God."

45:21.969 --> 45:25.098
And I realized
I was still the child...

45:25.223 --> 45:28.443
who had to act
on his most immediate fears.

45:32.396 --> 45:35.445
<i>So I get back to New York City.</i>

45:35.566 --> 45:38.035
I'm pretty depressed.

45:38.152 --> 45:40.029
More than usual.

45:40.154 --> 45:43.704
I'm sitting at the kitchen table,
talking to Renée...

45:43.824 --> 45:45.952
about the sweat lodge...

45:46.118 --> 45:48.746
and listening
to my health-food show...

45:48.871 --> 45:52.466
Barry Spires, every day at noon.

45:52.625 --> 45:54.127
In case you don't know...

45:54.293 --> 45:56.762
Barry Spires is one of the most
radical nutritionists in the universe.

45:56.879 --> 45:58.802
He sleeps two hours a day...

45:58.965 --> 46:02.139
and lives on air,
when he can find it.

46:02.301 --> 46:04.645
Usually I listen to him -
I go up and buy health food...

46:04.804 --> 46:07.148
up at the local health food store
and listen...

46:07.265 --> 46:09.225
but I never can eat,
because according to Barry...

46:09.308 --> 46:13.029
<i>everything</i> gives you cancer,
and everything else cures you of it.

46:13.145 --> 46:16.490
So I'm listening, and Renée gets
this lightbulb idea after the show.

46:16.649 --> 46:20.244
"Why don't you call Barry up?
I'll bet he knows what to do about your eye."

46:20.361 --> 46:23.661
So I give it a try, and he's wide-open.
He knows all about a macula pucker...

46:23.823 --> 46:25.666
and he says,
"Have you ever heard of...

46:25.825 --> 46:28.419
Dr. Ron A. Axe
in Nutley, New Jersey?"

46:28.536 --> 46:30.709
"No, I can't say that I have."

46:30.830 --> 46:34.585
"Well, he is the top nutritional
ophthalmologist in America.

46:34.709 --> 46:36.586
You should give him a call."

46:36.711 --> 46:39.009
So I call Dr. Ron A. Axe's number...

46:39.171 --> 46:41.344
and I get this wizened old voice.

46:41.507 --> 46:43.726
I mean, I have nothing against
old people, but I don't know...

46:43.843 --> 46:45.963
if a doctor should have
a receptionist quite this old.

46:45.970 --> 46:48.473
It's like Tiresias.
It's androgynous.

46:48.597 --> 46:50.224
You don't know
if it's a man or a woman. It's...

46:50.349 --> 46:54.024
[ Creaking Voice ]
"Hello? What?

46:54.186 --> 46:56.939
You want to see who?

46:57.064 --> 46:59.692
Dr. Axe is very busy.

46:59.859 --> 47:03.534
You'll just have to take your chances
and c-come on out.

47:03.696 --> 47:06.870
And come early,
because you're gonna have to fill out...

47:07.033 --> 47:10.333
an extensive dietary questionnaire.

47:10.453 --> 47:13.172
Now, if you're coming by bus"...
"I am."

47:13.289 --> 47:16.293
"you take the Port Authority
to the Nutley Mall...

47:16.417 --> 47:20.763
get off, turn left on Fay Street,
and come on down.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.224
You can't miss us."

47:23.382 --> 47:26.431
Hangs up. Nothing.
No appointment, no address.

47:26.552 --> 47:29.180
But I think, "Hmm.

47:29.305 --> 47:31.478
Sounds like an important journey...

47:31.599 --> 47:35.069
and I should do
what the old voice said."

47:35.186 --> 47:38.406
<i>So I take the bus out
from Port Authority to the Nutley Mall.</i>

47:38.564 --> 47:40.692
Get off.
I turn left on Fay Street.

47:40.816 --> 47:43.740
I don't notice anything.
I mean, it's <i>New Jersey.</i> It's a wasteland.

47:43.903 --> 47:47.373
Tract houses, no landscaping,
high-tension wires.

47:47.490 --> 47:49.834
Then I round the corner,
and - boom! - there it is.

47:49.950 --> 47:53.580
Whoo! it's like Froot Loops.
It's like Hansel and Gretel's house on acid.

47:53.746 --> 47:55.589
It's like a Howard Finster dream.

47:55.748 --> 47:57.591
All the shingles are
the color of the rainbow.

47:57.750 --> 48:00.253
Day-Glo outlines
around the windows of the house.

48:00.419 --> 48:03.764
The rocks the foundation is built from
are all the primary colors.

48:03.923 --> 48:06.802
A bunch of fir trees over there
with a big sign that says...

48:06.926 --> 48:09.054
"Dr. Ron A. Axe...

48:09.178 --> 48:11.556
O.D., F.F.A.O...

48:11.680 --> 48:16.106
F.C.O.U.D., F.I.C.A., F.A.S.S."

48:16.268 --> 48:19.943
And out of the fir trees jumps this
spindly little man with bottle-thick glasses.

48:20.106 --> 48:23.576
I hope it's not Dr. Ron A. Axe.
No, it's his brother, Don B. Axe.

48:23.692 --> 48:26.115
Brother and assistant. He jumps out
as though he's been hiding in there...

48:26.237 --> 48:27.659
waiting for me all day.

48:27.780 --> 48:30.380
Hops out and says, "Hello, Mr. Gray.
You are Mr. Gray, aren't you?

48:30.491 --> 48:33.916
Follow me. We're going to the sun porch
to fill out the dietary questionnaire."

48:34.036 --> 48:36.710
I follow him around, come into the sunporch.
I am overwhelmed.

48:36.831 --> 48:39.584
Quadraphonic opera is playing.
<i>Madame Butterfly,</i> full blast.

48:39.708 --> 48:41.506
On the wall are all these ski medals.

48:41.627 --> 48:43.971
To my right, a six-foot-high cutout
of Hoagy Carmichael.

48:44.088 --> 48:46.168
Over to the left,
these little miniature dinosaurs...

48:46.173 --> 48:48.471
playing in a miniature
prehistoric landscape.

48:48.592 --> 48:51.220
On the ceiling, floating,
four-foot-wide map of the moon...

48:51.345 --> 48:52.972
famed in a pink Hula hoop.

48:53.097 --> 48:55.617
To the left, the toothless head
of a Bengal tiger roaring at me.

48:55.724 --> 48:58.773
And spewing down the wall
like a yellow papering waterfall...

48:58.894 --> 49:02.364
is this 1964 original teletype printout...

49:02.481 --> 49:06.952
of Lyndon Johnson's acceptance speech
for the Democratic National Convention.

49:07.069 --> 49:08.946
And I'm looking around,
and Don says...

49:09.071 --> 49:11.119
"All this stuff makes you want to see,
doesn't it, Mr. Gray?

49:11.240 --> 49:14.835
Really activates the eyes.
Makes you want to look."

49:14.952 --> 49:16.795
"Yeah."

49:16.912 --> 49:18.789
<i>So he gets out
the dietary questionnaire.</i>

49:18.914 --> 49:21.258
It's 754 questions...

49:21.375 --> 49:24.128
concerning all the foods
I may have eaten in the past six months.

49:24.253 --> 49:26.130
And he's got all
the categories here -

49:26.255 --> 49:28.508
soups, meat, poultry, eggs, fish...

49:28.632 --> 49:31.636
seafood, dairy products, vegetables,
desserts, sweets, beverages...

49:31.760 --> 49:34.684
grains, breads, cereals, nuts,
seeds, legumes, fruits...

49:34.805 --> 49:38.935
spices, herbs, flavoring,
condiments, miscellaneous items.

49:39.059 --> 49:42.529
And he begins with "burrito."

49:42.646 --> 49:46.025
"All right, how many burritos
have you had in the past six months?"

49:46.150 --> 49:48.118
"Um-" Now, I've got
a photographic memory...

49:48.235 --> 49:50.704
and I can remember the Mexican restaurants,
but I can't remember what was on the plate.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.915
Was it a burrito? Was it a taco?
"All right, please.

49:53.032 --> 49:54.579
How many? Quickly, quickly."

49:54.700 --> 49:56.668
"Um... 18."

49:56.785 --> 50:00.210
"All right. Eighteen burritos.
Were they whole wheat or flour?"

50:00.372 --> 50:03.342
"Whole wheat?
I don't travel in those circles."

50:03.459 --> 50:06.713
"All right. Eighteen flour.
On to borscht, please. Borscht."

50:06.879 --> 50:09.052
"Borscht? I don't eat it or drink it
or whatever you do to it.

50:09.173 --> 50:11.346
Just forget it.
Wait a minute. Don't forget it.

50:11.467 --> 50:14.721
You've got me so confused. I don't have
an average six months in my life.

50:14.845 --> 50:17.894
Five months ago, I was in Russia.
I don't ever expect to be there again...

50:18.057 --> 50:19.650
but I was eating borscht every day."

50:19.767 --> 50:22.611
"How many days were you there?"
"I think it was a 14-day trip."

50:22.728 --> 50:25.322
"We'll put 16 in case you had
some for breakfast.

50:25.439 --> 50:28.113
On to hot dogs, hot dogs?"
"No hot dogs. Skip it.

50:28.234 --> 50:30.578
No. No, wait a minute.
No, no. Two months ago...

50:30.736 --> 50:32.579
I think it was,
I was in Columbus, Ohio...

50:32.738 --> 50:35.116
and just across from my bed-and-breakfast
there was this place called Coney Island.

50:35.241 --> 50:37.118
I'd go in every day,
and I'd order two -

50:37.243 --> 50:39.746
No, wait a minute. Those were wieners.
We'll wait till we get to W."

50:39.912 --> 50:42.165
And into the middle of this
comes the old voice.

50:42.289 --> 50:45.259
It's his 87-year-old mother
with these bottle-thick glasses...

50:45.417 --> 50:47.260
and a big babushka, saying...

50:47.419 --> 50:50.468
"Time to bring Mr. Gray in
to see Dr. Axe."

50:50.589 --> 50:53.263
"Stop it, Mother. Please. We have not
finished the dietary questionnaire."

50:53.425 --> 50:56.395
"Bring him into the antechamber, then.
Finish it there.

50:56.512 --> 50:59.516
Bring him in to the antechamber."

50:59.640 --> 51:01.608
"Antechamber"?

51:03.310 --> 51:05.233
<i>So into the antechamber we go.</i>

51:05.354 --> 51:07.857
Quadraphonic opera's playing
full blast in there.

51:07.982 --> 51:10.235
On the wall, the box
from the Metropolitan Opera.

51:10.359 --> 51:12.953
The general manager, Don,
used to sing for the Met...

51:13.112 --> 51:15.956
and after they tore it down,
somehow he salvaged the box...

51:16.073 --> 51:18.997
and it's up there, and it's got cutouts
of Toscanini and Caruso...

51:19.118 --> 51:21.541
black and white, six foot high,
staring down.

51:21.662 --> 51:24.632
Miniature Valkyries underneath.
Crossed sabers underneath.

51:24.748 --> 51:26.796
On the ceiling -
map of the universe.

51:26.917 --> 51:29.670
Christmas balls hanging down
and strings at different levels.

51:29.795 --> 51:32.719
And Don is saying to me,
"Rabbit. How many rabbits do you eat?

51:32.840 --> 51:35.013
Do you eat it with the skin on? Skin off?
Dark meat? Light meat?"

51:35.134 --> 51:37.262
I said, "No, no. No rabbits.
Renée won't let them in the house."

51:37.386 --> 51:40.356
Meanwhile, the mother is saying,
"Bring him in now. Skip it.

51:40.472 --> 51:44.648
Finish the dietary questionnaire later.
Bring him in to see Dr. Axe now."

51:44.810 --> 51:46.983
♪ Ta-da ♪
The door opens...

51:47.104 --> 51:49.983
and there, sitting behind his desk
is this spindly little man...

51:50.107 --> 51:52.155
with these bottle-thick glasses.

51:52.318 --> 51:55.071
A sign reading
"Dr. Ron A. Axe...

51:55.195 --> 51:57.163
O.D., F.F.A.O.,

51:57.323 --> 51:59.826
F.C.O.U.D., F.I.C.A...

51:59.992 --> 52:02.165
F.A.S.S."

52:02.286 --> 52:05.836
And he says,
"Welcome, Mr. Gray. Welcome.

52:05.956 --> 52:09.176
Please, get in the electric chair."

52:09.293 --> 52:13.014
He refers to his examination chair
as an "electric chair." I don't know why.

52:13.172 --> 52:15.675
I get into the blue examination chair,
and he begins...

52:15.841 --> 52:19.436
- what I could only call a family slideshow.
<i>- [ Slide Projector Clicking ]</i>

52:19.553 --> 52:21.976
The first slide was
of he and his brother, Don...

52:22.097 --> 52:24.691
skiing down Mount Washington,
down Tuckerman's Ravine.

52:24.850 --> 52:26.568
Tucking down Tuckerman's.

52:26.685 --> 52:29.063
Next slide: he and his brother
and his 87-year-old mother...

52:29.188 --> 52:30.940
skiing in Stowe, Vermont.

52:31.065 --> 52:34.114
The next one: he and his brother
and his 87-year-old mother...

52:34.234 --> 52:36.032
visiting Lenin's tomb.

52:36.153 --> 52:38.702
I'm trying to relate to this, so I say,
"Oh, yeah. Lenin's tomb.

52:38.822 --> 52:43.043
That's where I was five months ago.
That's where I had the 16 borscht."

52:43.160 --> 52:45.538
Then something strange happened.

52:45.663 --> 52:47.540
Somehow -
I don't know how he did this -

52:47.706 --> 52:50.209
up into the left-hand corner
of the family slide...

52:50.334 --> 52:53.053
he fades an eye chart,
a traditional doctor's eye chart...

52:53.212 --> 52:55.681
and he says,
"Can you read this?"

52:55.798 --> 52:57.892
And I found I could.
I could read it better...

52:58.050 --> 53:00.052
than I could read it
in my Chinese doctor's office.

53:00.177 --> 53:02.896
I don't know why.
Maybe the family slideshow relaxed me.

53:03.013 --> 53:05.812
But I thought, "You know,
there's method in this man's <i>meshugaas.</i>

53:05.933 --> 53:08.561
I'm gonna let him examine my pucker."

53:08.727 --> 53:10.320
And he does.

53:10.437 --> 53:12.405
Looks at both eyes, then says...

53:12.564 --> 53:15.113
"Now, Mr. Gray,
I would just like to speculate...

53:15.234 --> 53:17.236
speculate a bit on causes."

53:17.361 --> 53:20.331
"Oh. Causes. Great.
Maybe I'm not idiopathic after all.

53:20.447 --> 53:21.824
Let's give it a run."

53:21.949 --> 53:23.917
"I'd just like to throw it out.
Vitamin C -

53:24.076 --> 53:25.919
Do you take a lot of vitamin C?"

53:26.078 --> 53:28.456
"Sure. I have to when I'm on the road.
I don't have an understudy.

53:28.580 --> 53:30.207
I can't afford to get a cold."

53:30.332 --> 53:32.426
"You know what
vitamin C is, Mr. Gray?

53:32.543 --> 53:35.217
"Um, I thought it was vitamin C."

53:35.337 --> 53:38.932
"Wrong. It's ascorbic acid.
And do you know the vitreous humor...

53:39.091 --> 53:42.220
and the pancreas are two parts of the body
that can't assimilate ascorbic acid?

53:42.344 --> 53:44.704
So why would you be doing that -
pouring acid into your eye?

53:44.805 --> 53:47.103
Now, if it isn't the vitamin C,
it's the ozone layer.

53:47.266 --> 53:49.109
It's breaking down.
Sheep are going blind in New Zealand.

53:49.268 --> 53:52.112
I hope you're wearing a big broad-brimmed
hat and good thick sunglasses.

53:52.271 --> 53:55.275
Now, this is all speculation. You've got to
have a blood and urine workup...

53:55.399 --> 53:57.560
and then come back to me
as soon as you have that done.

53:57.609 --> 54:00.783
As for today, it's $240.
You go and pay my mother."

54:00.946 --> 54:04.450
I go and pay the mother $240.
No health insurance in that place.

54:04.575 --> 54:06.953
She's sitting there
with her babushka on, going...

54:07.077 --> 54:09.671
"Work, work, work.

54:09.788 --> 54:12.962
That's all my son does now
is work and research.

54:13.125 --> 54:16.095
He doesn't sleep.
I don't have a life.

54:16.211 --> 54:19.260
We don't even ski anymore.
I'm 87 years old...

54:19.381 --> 54:21.349
and I don't have a life!"

54:22.426 --> 54:24.269
<i>So I hand her the $240 check...</i>

54:24.386 --> 54:27.060
and I go out searching
for blood and urine analysis clinics.

54:27.181 --> 54:30.185
I'm going from New York to San Francisco.
Every clinic I go to...

54:30.309 --> 54:33.108
looks at the paperwork
and the technicians say...

54:33.228 --> 54:36.402
"We don't test human beings
for this stuff."

54:36.523 --> 54:38.525
So I don't know what to do.
I call Dr. Axe.

54:38.650 --> 54:40.869
He recommends a place
up in upstate New York.

54:40.986 --> 54:42.863
Maybe they're in cahoots.
I go up there.

54:42.988 --> 54:45.457
One thousand dollars they charge me.
No health insurance.

54:45.574 --> 54:48.293
They draw more blood from me
than I've ever had taken before.

54:48.410 --> 54:50.959
And then they give me this, like,
milk carton, you know, with a handle.

54:51.079 --> 54:54.333
Like, a cardboard box
to collect my urine for 24 hours.

54:54.458 --> 54:57.818
I'm carrying it around with me everywhere.
I'm ducking behind hedges in Central Park.

54:57.878 --> 55:00.631
I'm carrying it to therapy.
I got it at the theater between my legs.

55:00.756 --> 55:02.633
I'm traveling on the subway
with it between my legs...

55:02.758 --> 55:05.307
having made the mistake of eating
asparagus the night before.

55:05.427 --> 55:07.350
At last I get all the paperwork done.

55:07.513 --> 55:10.357
I bring in the report to Dr. Axe,
and he's reviewing it...

55:10.474 --> 55:12.351
and he looks down, and he says...

55:12.476 --> 55:15.025
"Here's your culprit: vanadium.

55:15.145 --> 55:17.364
Goes right off the chart."

55:17.481 --> 55:19.233
"Vanadium? What's that?"

55:19.358 --> 55:21.861
"A rare element used to toughen steel

55:21.985 --> 55:24.033
and make it more shock-resistant.

55:24.154 --> 55:26.532
In short, you're filled with heavy metal."

55:26.698 --> 55:30.453
"But where would it come from?
I mean, none of my friends have it."

55:30.577 --> 55:33.376
"Sea cucumbers and sea anemones."

55:33.497 --> 55:35.966
"But I never eat them.
I don't know anything about them."

55:36.083 --> 55:39.804
"No, but I bet you eat big fish, don't you?
I bet you're a fan of big fish."

55:39.920 --> 55:42.799
"Yes, I love to eat big fish.
I eat it any chance I get."

55:42.923 --> 55:46.124
"Well, that's where it comes from.
They eat the sea cucumbers and sea anemones...

55:46.134 --> 55:48.432
and it gets into their fatty tissue,
and you eat it.

55:48.554 --> 55:51.558
So you've got to give it up.
Got to give up all your big fish.

55:51.682 --> 55:55.061
Your swordfish, your salmon,
your tuna, your mahimahi.

55:55.185 --> 55:58.735
You've got to give up your shellfish,
crustaceans, lobsters...

55:58.897 --> 56:01.400
scallops and chicken and turkey."

56:01.525 --> 56:03.994
"Chicken and turkey?
But why chicken and turkey?"

56:04.111 --> 56:07.240
"Because they grind up big fish
and feed them to the chicken and turkey.

56:07.364 --> 56:10.083
You understand? Give it up.
Just eat raw vegetables.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.498
That's what you should do.
The only reason people cook vegetables...

56:12.619 --> 56:14.587
is 'cause in the old days,
people had wooden false teeth.

56:14.705 --> 56:16.958
Now you don't have to.
Eat it raw. You hear me?

56:17.082 --> 56:20.382
Raw! Raw! Raw!"

56:20.502 --> 56:24.552
Uh, to improve my eyesight,
go on an all-raw-vegetable diet?

56:24.673 --> 56:28.303
Uh, that'd be tough.
I don't think so.

56:28.427 --> 56:31.522
A raw-vegetable diet?

56:31.638 --> 56:34.687
Yeah. If it would
improve my sight, yeah.

56:34.808 --> 56:36.776
Well, yes, I think so.

56:36.894 --> 56:40.148
I like anything that has to do
with nutrition if I feel like it's valid...

56:40.272 --> 56:42.400
and something that
I would enjoy anyway.

56:42.524 --> 56:44.401
'Cause I already like vegetables.

56:44.526 --> 56:48.121
Oh, yes, because I happen to be
reading that right now...

56:48.280 --> 56:50.954
and I believe in totally -

56:51.074 --> 56:54.453
The raw vegetables is the only way
to get the live enzymes...

56:54.620 --> 56:57.089
and vitamins
out of fruits and vegetables.

56:57.205 --> 56:59.082
I think I would consider...

56:59.207 --> 57:02.256
going on an all-raw-vegetable diet...

57:02.377 --> 57:05.221
if the person giving me that pitch
was convincing enough, I think...

57:05.339 --> 57:07.762
and if I wouldn't have to
do that for too long.

57:07.883 --> 57:11.683
I don't think an all-raw-vegetable
diet is for me.

57:11.803 --> 57:15.603
I'm omnivorous,
and I really enjoy the meat in my diet...

57:15.724 --> 57:17.818
so no, I don't think I would.

57:18.977 --> 57:21.571
And he put the fear into me,
and I totally believed him...

57:21.688 --> 57:24.316
and I went on
a raw-vegetable diet.

57:24.483 --> 57:28.408
I went to the supermarket,
a place I thought used to have food.

57:28.528 --> 57:30.622
I mean, I look down the aisle,
I think...

57:30.739 --> 57:33.538
"Nothing there for me.
Nothing there for me. Nothing there -"

57:33.659 --> 57:35.536
I've never seen
so much nothing in my life.

57:35.661 --> 57:38.342
In the old days, when I'd shop,
I wouldn't even take a list with me.

57:38.413 --> 57:40.293
I would just take the cart,
go down the aisle...

57:40.415 --> 57:42.167
take whatever caught my eye -
my good eye -

57:42.292 --> 57:44.169
pop it into the wagon,
go down.

57:44.294 --> 57:46.467
Now I have to go
to the vegetable area. What is it?

57:46.588 --> 57:50.013
It's a bunch of vegetables being spritzed
with a [ imitates Spritzer] sprayer.

57:50.175 --> 57:53.395
It's supposed to make them look glossy.
In my opinion, it's waterlogging them.

57:53.512 --> 57:56.140
The celery's soggy.
I don't know where to go find vegetables.

57:56.264 --> 57:58.187
I go the farmers' market
in Manhattan...

57:58.350 --> 58:00.227
in Union Square
every Wednesday and Saturday...

58:00.352 --> 58:02.525
hoping I'll find
the Pennsylvania Dutch bringing in...

58:02.646 --> 58:04.694
some exotic turnips or something...

58:04.856 --> 58:07.109
and I see this sign that says...

58:07.234 --> 58:09.953
"Farm-raised trout
from the Catskills."

58:10.070 --> 58:12.664
I think, "Oh, boy.
There's a fish I could eat.

58:12.781 --> 58:14.783
Raised on a farm in the Catskills?

58:14.908 --> 58:17.536
Couldn't run into
any sea cucumbers up there."

58:17.703 --> 58:20.263
So I go over, I'm chatting the woman up.
There are three of them.

58:20.372 --> 58:22.215
She's wrapping them in newspaper.
I say...

58:22.374 --> 58:24.974
"Hey, by the way, I'm just curious -
what do you feed your trout?"

58:25.043 --> 58:27.717
She says, "Chicken."

58:27.838 --> 58:30.011
Also, I'd given up drinking alcohol.

58:30.132 --> 58:32.476
Went cold-turkey.
Just stopped, you know?

58:32.592 --> 58:35.141
I mean, after my mother's death,
the only religious ritual...

58:35.262 --> 58:37.356
left in our home
was cocktail hour.

58:37.472 --> 58:40.726
What's a day without cocktail hour?
It's just one big...

58:40.892 --> 58:43.611
[Grating Sound ]

58:48.233 --> 58:49.951
Bed!

58:50.068 --> 58:53.322
So I was on this raw-vegetable diet.
I'd given up pretty much everything:

58:53.447 --> 58:56.326
sugar, caffeine,
nicotine, alcohol, meat -

58:56.450 --> 58:58.623
and pretty much sex too,
'cause they're all interconnected.

58:58.744 --> 59:01.167
I hadn't realized that
until I gave all those up.

59:01.288 --> 59:05.259
And I got this raw-vegetable diet,
and it's causing enormous intestinal gas...

59:05.417 --> 59:07.511
and Renée and I are practically
breaking up over it.

59:07.627 --> 59:09.667
I'm getting real thin,
and Renée's mother sees me...

59:09.755 --> 59:12.053
and she says,
"Spalding, it looks like...

59:12.174 --> 59:15.178
you have just entered
the Bermuda Triangle of health."

59:15.302 --> 59:18.146
Renée's mother's got this theory that
this Bermuda Triangle of health...

59:18.263 --> 59:19.856
is between 50 and 53.

59:19.973 --> 59:21.814
That's when everything
starts happening to you.

59:21.933 --> 59:23.731
If you make it through,
you live to a ripe old age.

59:23.852 --> 59:26.446
She had a heart attack at 51.
She survived. She outlived it.

59:26.605 --> 59:29.484
Her husband, Renée's father -
mm, he died at 52. Didn't make it.

59:29.608 --> 59:31.781
My mom killed herself at 52.

59:31.943 --> 59:34.287
Renée's mother's brother
had a heart attack at 50.

59:34.404 --> 59:36.364
He made it through
the Bermuda Triangle of health.

59:36.448 --> 59:39.201
And I was in it,
and I was damn lonely.

59:39.326 --> 59:42.830
I'm saying to my doctor, "Please, show me
someone else that has a macular pucker."

59:42.954 --> 59:46.800
He tells me hundreds of people have them,
but he's not giving me any phone numbers.

59:46.917 --> 59:49.545
So I'm so lonely that I go down
to <i>The Village Voice</i> newspaper...

59:49.669 --> 59:53.014
and I put an ad in that says,
"Macular Pucker Club -

59:53.131 --> 59:55.225
Does anyone else have one?

59:55.342 --> 59:57.640
Let's share stories."

59:57.761 --> 59:59.684
And all I get is a letter from a guy...

59:59.805 --> 01:00:02.479
who wants to scrape me.

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:08.898
Then the inevitable happened.
My Chinese doctor called me in...

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:10.399
to have my eye examination.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:12.026
I didn't want to go, really.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.073
I just denied that it was
ever going to happen.

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:16.538
I drag myself in. I sit there.

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:19.659
I don't have a book anymore.
I'm just waiting for my pupils to dilate.

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:22.829
I- I- I'm munching
on a sweet potato, I remember.

01:00:22.994 --> 01:00:25.747
And out of the nurses' office
comes this man...

01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:28.250
with a - oh, God, a drooping eye!

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:30.503
It's worse than a bloodhound.
Worse than Elephant Man.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.595
I can't look at it.
I say, "Nurse, what was that?"

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:35.682
She goes,
"Oh, Mr. Gray, that's the drooping eye."

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:38.052
"I figured as much,
but where would it come from?"

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:40.520
"Oh, sometimes it's a result
of the operation."

01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:42.477
"What? No one told me that!"

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:44.474
"Oh, Mr. Gray, don't be a silly-billy.

01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:47.603
It's easily fixed
with corrective or plastic surgery."

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:50.025
And she goes back into the office,
and I am sitting there.

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:52.691
I go into a bubble.
I'm completely freaked out.

01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:56.738
I picture Jesus, like the old days,
coming into the waiting room, you know?

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:59.536
And the way he used to come
to the multitudes and - ♫ [ Fanfare ]

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:02.216
And the lame shall walk, and -
♫ [ Fanfare ] the deaf shall hear.

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:06.000
And - bing! - the blind shall see.
One-touch Jesus - that's what I picture.

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:08.374
Or E.T. with his magical,
sparky finger...

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.047
coming and - zhoom! -
zapping my eye, and I'm better.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:13.637
'Cause that's what I want.
I want magic and miracles.

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:16.097
I don't want this medicine, please.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:18.592
And as I'm thinking this - boop! -
the man with the drooping eye...

01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:22.062
trips over my foot, runs into a woman
whose pupils are dilated.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.565
She "sclumps" down next to me
and says, "Hello.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.901
I have a macula pucker.
What do you have?"

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:30.107
Oh! I hug her! At last!

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:32.606
"Oh, my God, it's so good to meet you.
What have you been doing?"

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:35.359
She said, "Well, I've been doing
some alternative therapies...

01:01:35.483 --> 01:01:39.408
but I had to come in here today
because today is my preoperative exam.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:42.078
I have to make up my mind by Thursday."
"What? Oh, my God!

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.361
I wouldn't know what to do if they told me
Thursday. What are you going to do?"

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:47.295
"I don't know.
To tell you the truth...

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:50.452
I helped cofound the emergency room
at Roosevelt Hospital. And if you knew...

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:53.178
what I knew about New York hospitals,
I don't think you'd go in one."

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:55.345
"Oh, I know.
That's what all my friends are saying.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:57.385
So I've been trying
to do alternatives myself."

01:01:57.505 --> 01:02:00.099
She said, "Well, I'm considering -
A friend of mine - listen -

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:02.436
had a breast tumor
plucked from her breast.

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.771
No cutting or anything like that.

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:07.732
She went to the Philippines
to a psychic surgeon."

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:10.819
"What?
A Philippines psychic surgeon?

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:12.904
Why didn't I think of that?"

01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:16.116
"Well, you could still go. I have his name.
His name is Trini Boca.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:19.113
He's known - I don't know why -
as the Elvis Presley of psychic surgeons.

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:21.450
He's in Manila.
I'll give you all the information."

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:24.571
Just as she's telling me this, the nurse
comes out of the office and says...

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.077
"The doctor will see you now, Mr. Gray."

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:31.457
And I say, "Well - Well- Well -
I'm not ready to see the doctor.

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:34.255
- I'm off to the Philippines!"

If I flew to the Philippines
to be treated by a psychic surgeon...

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:43.469
I don't believe anything
would happen to me.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:47.268
I believe in real doctors

01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:49.391
And pretty nurses.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:51.359
No.

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:54.025
Just sounds too way-out.

Not my style.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.107
Never heard of it.

I think I - I think I would, uh -

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.364
I would try going to the Philippines
to see a psychic surgeon.

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:07.118
You know, if nothing else,
it'd be an interesting trip.

01:03:07.242 --> 01:03:09.711
I don't know.
I guess it couldn't hurt.

01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:11.922
Psychic surgeon? No.

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:14.291
I don't really believe
in psychic surgeons.

I wouldn't mind going

I don't believe in it, no.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:24.267
[Laughs]

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:27.479
A psychic surgeon?

01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:30.223
That doesn't appeal to me either.
No, I don't think so.

01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:33.727
I'm not a believer in psychic surgery.

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:36.776
Uh, my best friend's
an ophthalmic surgeon...

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:38.773

before a Filipino.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:44.954
And I did it! I flew all the way
to the Philippines on my own...

without taking a drink
on the plane once.

01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:49.033
I arrive. I'm pretty jet-lagged.
I got directions.

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:51.515
I'm supposed to go down
to Trini Boca's psychic surgery lab...

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:53.455
at 9:30 in the morning
there in Manila.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.378
Used to be the Tip Top Disco.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.793
Now it's been converted
to a psychic surgery lab.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:04:00.511
I arrive at 9:30.
I'm the only Westerner there.

The rest are Japanese.
About 50 Japanese.

There's a bus tour - Psychic Surgeons
of the Philippines - that they're on.

01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:08.937
I think 25 are being operated on.
The other 25 are videotaping it...

01:04:09.054 --> 01:04:10.772
judging from the equipment
they've got.

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:12.891

We get to the end of the corridor, there's
this huge crucifix of Jesus - who else?

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:22.492
And I turn,
we go into the operating room...

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:25.783

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.793
when you finish operating
on the Japanese today...

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:07.175
just wash your hands
in rubbing alcohol...

01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:11.263
come to my hotel room,
do a private operation with me, please?"

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:14.929
[ Filipino Accent]
"No. We do not do the private here.

01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:18.178
Group only. No, no.
No private operation."

01:08:18.303 --> 01:08:21.307
"But you have to respect
my fear for AIDS.

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:24.310
How would I totally relax and lie out
on a table and give over to you...

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:26.185
if I have that fear in the way?"

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:28.359
"There's no AIDS here.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:31.153
One man came.
He had the virus. Did not tell me.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:33.447
My hands,
they would not enter, they go...

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:35.662
zoom!
[Gurgling ]

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:39.911
No AIDS."

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:43.002
I wanted to believe him.
I wanted to get on that table.

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.167
"Where would I ever get the courage?"
I thought.

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:48.504
And I thought,
"I will just get in with the Japanese.

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:51.419
When they start moving,
they got that kamikaze energy.

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:54.548
Up on that table. No doubt."

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:58.176
<i>So I get in line with the Japanese
that are gonna be operated on.</i>

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:01.930
They strip to their underwear. I'm stripping
to my red Fruit of the Loom jockey shorts.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:04.216
And I'm just standing there,
my knees shaking, waiting.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:06.856
And Trini comes,
he rolls up his sleeves.

01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:10.192
The Japanese woman from the day before
comes up, lies out on the table.

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:12.907
He takes his hands
and drives them into her stomach.

01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:16.368
The blood shoots five feet into the air.
People start going around.

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:19.201
It's my turn. I rush up.
I lie out on the table. I'm shaking.

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:23.870
I look up and say, "Trini, remember,
it's just my eye. Just my left eye.

01:09:24.035 --> 01:09:27.710
Don't be pulling
any meatballs out of me, please."

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:30.549
He raises his hands.
Shows me - nothing in them.

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:32.544
He goes over,
he washes them off...

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:35.798
in basically what looks like
a bucket of blood.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:38.242
Picks up the cotton gauze.
This is where the "debunk" is...

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.469
like Amazing Randi says,
that they hide the blood pellets.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:43.938
But as if to show me, prove it to me,
opens it - nothing in them.

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:46.057
Comes at me. Two fingers. Oop.

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:49.319
All of a sudden, I feel this pressure.
His fingers are going in my eye.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.483
Blood is coming out.
I assume it's my blood.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:53.572
It doesn't feel like my blood,
though neither does a nosebleed...

01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:55.233
when it comes out of my nose.

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:57.478
But it's coming down,
dripping over my other eye. Pop!

01:09:57.568 --> 01:09:59.787
Pulls his finger out.
No. Stops.

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:03.329
I run, not to the back of the line
but to the men's room to look in the mirror.

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:06.248
I'm looking at my eye, and there's
no blood leftover. What's going on?

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:09.381
And I don't see any better.
And now all I can hear is my friends...

01:10:09.497 --> 01:10:11.499
back in Barrington,
Rhode Island, saying...

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:14.753
"Say you went to a guy
who started pulling meatballs...

01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:16.967
out of you the size of melons.

01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:19.841
Would you go to a doctor then?"

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:21.388
"Yes!

01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:23.185
Yes!

01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:25.388
Yes!"

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:29.438
At first, I really thought that
this gentleman was just an actor...

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:32.483
and that he would try
to memorize...

01:10:32.603 --> 01:10:35.903
or let's say just be able to give
his lines in a certain way.

01:10:36.023 --> 01:10:39.527
But he was so very good at it,
and he was so very knowledgeable, really...

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:41.654
when it came
to some of the medical terms...

01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:44.282
and I guess
he became so believable...

01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:48.249
that I really wanted to question
whether it was fiction or it was for real.

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:51.122
Well, I just thought that...

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:54.421
the methods he chose,
the alternative methods...

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:57.216
including the sweat box...

01:10:57.336 --> 01:11:00.431
the psychic Philippine person...

01:11:00.548 --> 01:11:04.052
and the raw vegetables -
they were just so extreme.

01:11:04.177 --> 01:11:08.933
I didn't think anybody would go
through those extremes to, uh...

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:13.944
you know,
to treat an eye problem.

01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:17.156
And he obviously is
a very intelligent person.

01:11:17.315 --> 01:11:18.988
He's very neurotic.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:21.406
I think he certainly
takes things to extreme...

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:25.122
and I'm not sure I agree
with his thought process about everything...

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:28.334
but I really was surprised...

01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:31.087
that it really was -
He was the patient. Mm-hmm.

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:35.334
I think he was kind of humorous.
I really do. it's kind of, um...

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.460
more New Yorker style, I guess.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:42.348
I think he would be
a very pleasant person...

01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:45.511
but I don't know if I could...

01:11:45.676 --> 01:11:47.519
relate to him quite as easily.

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:50.516
I think he would be a challenge,
and I think he'd be somebody...

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.315
that you would find it
challenging to consult...

01:11:54.435 --> 01:11:57.985
but I certainly would advise him...

01:11:58.105 --> 01:12:01.826
some of these alternative therapies
that he should not do.

01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:04.287
And I think I probably would
spend more time...

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:06.405
just trying to reassure him...

01:12:06.531 --> 01:12:10.206
that this condition does have
a fairly good prognosis...

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:14.001
and that he should've done this
earlier rather than later. Mm-hmm.

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:17.250
So I get back to New York City,
sure that I'm gonna have the operation.

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:19.252
When I get back, I'm not so sure.

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:21.880
The nurse calls, says I should come in.
The doctor wants to see me.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:23.881
He's heard I've been
to the Philippines.

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:26.555
They want to do
a kind of preoperative exam.

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:29.304
I don't have to get the operation.
It's my choice, right?

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:32.022
Also, they say, "Come in on Friday.
It's a half day.

01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:34.358
There won't be anyone
in the waiting room."

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:37.570
So that's a temptation,
and I do come in.

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:40.065
No one's there.
I'm getting my pupils dilated.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.783
I have no book.
I'm doing my dilation meditation...

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:45.949
kind of fuzzing out there,
and I look down the corridor...

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:50.075
and I see this guy backing out
of my doctor's office.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:52.543
And he's kind of waving
as he's backing up.

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:55.334
And it's like an old-time movie.
It's like a Buster Keaton movie.

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:58.207
And he turns,
and he's walking toward me...

01:12:58.332 --> 01:13:01.381
and I realize he has
one of those rubber Nixon masks on...

01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:03.925
the kind you'd buy in a joke shop
when Nixon was president.

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:06.890
And I think,
"What's going on here? A robbery?"

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:09.227
He turns, he's coming toward me,
and I realize...

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:12.096
"Wait a minute.
It <i>is</i> Richard Nixon."

01:13:12.263 --> 01:13:14.391
And he's walking toward me
with intent...

01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:16.609
as if he's gonna say, "Hello.

01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:19.771
I saw <i>Swimming to Cambodia,</i>
and I loved it."

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:23.400
And then I think, "Wait a minute.
Maybe his pupils are dilated...

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:26.243
and he thinks I'm Ralph Lauren."

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:30.365
He walks up. I look up. I just say,
"Oh, hi," and he walks out.

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:32.787
But you know, the strange part is...

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.349
seeing Richard Nixon come out
of my doctor's office gave me...

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:38.415
the faith, the hope, and the courage
to have that operation.

01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:43.257
<i>I don't know if I could've done the operation
if Renée wasn't holding my hand.</i>

01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:45.630
<i>- [ Monitor Beeping ]
- I was terrified</i>

01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:49.266
They gave me a local anesthetic,
so I could hear everything that was going on.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:52.683
The doctors were talking about some party
they'd had the night before.

01:13:52.803 --> 01:13:54.976
While they were peeling me,
they were talking about a party.

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:56.815
Very nonchalant.

01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:58.935
The radio was playing
rock and roll, I remember -

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:02.030
Elton John, "Crocodile Rock."

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:04.695
When I came to,
I had a patch over my left eye.

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:06.783
And they put a gas bubble in there...

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:08.903
in my eye,
to prevent glaucoma.

01:14:09.028 --> 01:14:10.905
I'm glad I didn't know
they were gonna do that.

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:14.330
Turned out I couldn't raise my head at all,
'cause it would break the bubble.

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:17.416
Oh, and the doctor gave me
a videotape of the operation.

01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:20.460
He titled it
<i>Swimming to Macula Pucker.</i>

01:14:20.581 --> 01:14:22.549
Had a sense of humor.

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:25.796
I get home, I couldn't raise my head.
I had to sleep facedown.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.161
Renée put pillows on either side
so I couldn't roll over.

01:14:28.214 --> 01:14:30.512
I had to eat facedown.
I had to walk. I remember-

01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:33.144
Oh, I joined the Library for the Blind.
I could get books on tape.

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.558
And I remember Renée
guiding me up with my head down...

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.729
looking at chewing gum,
cigarette butts...

01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:40.851
graffiti, dog shit.

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:44.572
I get up and rented
<i>The Miracle Worker,</i> I remember.

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:47.330
And when I got back, Renée did
this ingenious thing with mirrors...

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:49.819
so that I could see
the videotape of the operation.

01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:52.868
She arranged mirrors
so I could see the monitor.

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:55.249
And... oh, whoa!

01:14:55.366 --> 01:14:58.870
What a video! I mean, you talk
about Philippine psychic surgeons.

01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:02.415
Here's a close-up of my macula.
It was magnified, so it looked like Mars.

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:06.135
It was very yellow, and the veins and
capillaries looked like the rivers on Mars.

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.550
And then into the frame
you see this little pincer come...

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:11.800
just like a little crab claw,
and begin to pick at the edema.

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:14.677
And it's coming off the retina
like gossamer threads.

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:17.180
I mean, never touching
the retina once.

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:19.227
Just off and up
until we're in whiteout.

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:21.893
I don't know where we are.
Renée's in the bathroom by now.

01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:25.154
And I see stitches
the size of ropes...

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:27.740
and I realize
they're sewing up my left eye.

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:30.076
It's like - whew! -
<i>The Andalusian Dog</i>

01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:31.952
magnified a hundred times.

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:34.288
I'm just thinking,
"This is just a movie.

01:15:34.405 --> 01:15:38.785
That's not my eye.
This is just a movie."

01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:41.788
And after 14 days, it was time
to have the patch removed.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:44.756
Renée and I went
to the doctor's office.

01:15:44.915 --> 01:15:48.761
He took the patch off,
and basically it was not great.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:52.098
It was like looking through the bottom
of an empty Coke bottle.

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:54.808
Real fuzzy.
Also, it was a cockeyed feeling...

01:15:54.925 --> 01:15:57.144
like I had this white hair
between my eyes...

01:15:57.261 --> 01:16:00.561
that just needed to be brushed,
but I couldn't find it to brush.

01:16:00.681 --> 01:16:02.962
And we went out and sat
on a park bench in Central Park...

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:05.858
and I looked across the park,
and in the distance I saw...

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:08.481
leaves blowing in the wind,
a bunch of children running...

01:16:08.606 --> 01:16:12.782
a red ball rolling,
a flock of starlings taking off.

01:16:12.943 --> 01:16:16.288
I covered my right eye.
No leaves.

01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:19.121
Blur of children.
Blotch of red.

01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:21.160
No birds.

01:16:21.285 --> 01:16:24.289
Covered my left -
ah, ecstasy.

01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:27.666
Covered my right -

01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:29.794
despair.

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:31.671
Ecstasy.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:35.178
Despair.

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:37.472
And I realized at that moment
that I was now living...

01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:40.809
the perfect yin-and-yang existence.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:44.104
And Renée and I went home,
and I ate big fish...

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:47.570
and I drank a bottle of wine,
and I smoked a cigar.

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:50.064
And I ate and I drank
and I smoked...
