00:00.410 --> 00:01.700
Previously on rescue me...

00:01.800 --> 00:03.670
Tommy hasn't had a drink in,like,what?

00:03.780 --> 00:05.610
11 months,4 weeks,and 2 days.

00:05.680 --> 00:07.950
Listen,jerry was a great guy and a great firefighter,

00:08.039 --> 00:09.760
so I got big shoes to fill.

00:09.860 --> 00:13.030
Hey,by the way,feinberg has been making a lot of noises about you lately.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.440
Ok,what kind of noises?

00:14.520 --> 00:15.270
Hey,calm down.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.140
I'm gonna-- Calm down.

00:16.230 --> 00:17.920
Run your narrow ass,I'm telling you,

00:18.010 --> 00:19.320
every second of every day.

00:19.470 --> 00:21.180
You ever hear of section eight?

00:21.270 --> 00:22.450
Which means you're nuts?

00:22.530 --> 00:23.990
The meeting is adjourned.

00:24.070 --> 00:25.420
Go!

00:25.530 --> 00:26.460
Tommy gavin around?

00:26.550 --> 00:27.320
Hey,col.

00:27.420 --> 00:28.040
Hi.

00:28.150 --> 00:30.690
Uh,he's somewhere inside.

00:32.180 --> 00:33.220
Hey,col.

00:33.510 --> 00:34.890
That's his daughter.

00:34.990 --> 00:36.490
Verboten.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.590
That means don'T.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.750
You know,after that initial...

00:40.810 --> 00:41.480
you know?

00:41.570 --> 00:42.420
I'll get a little bored,

00:42.710 --> 00:45.500
so I'll be able to hold on for a little bit longer,

00:45.570 --> 00:49.460
like-- You're basically saying that this is--this relationship is kind of...

00:49.540 --> 00:51.000
doomed.

00:51.740 --> 00:54.340
Well,aren't they all?

00:54.870 --> 00:55.700
He's a gavin.

00:55.790 --> 00:56.900
He was born to hate.

00:57.080 --> 00:58.140
Guys...

00:58.280 --> 00:59.180
listen,this is good.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.640
This will be,like,a natural break for everybody.

01:01.820 --> 01:04.450
It just,you know--

01:04.590 --> 01:09.750
Michael?Your mom-- she's passed.

01:09.840 --> 01:15.220
Some people think that when you die,you--you see,uh,people.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.350
And you and me both know that's bullshit.

01:17.430 --> 01:22.470
I'm not seeing your mother or johnny or connor ever again.

01:22.550 --> 01:23.450
I know that.

01:23.550 --> 01:27.410
You die,they stick your body in the ground,

01:27.490 --> 01:29.420
and you're worm food.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.030
Simple as that.

01:31.120 --> 01:34.790
Death is a goddamn scary thing,tom.

01:36.890 --> 01:40.260
We ask,father,that you welcome your servant

01:40.340 --> 01:44.280
michael james gavin into your heavenly kingdom,

01:44.340 --> 01:47.810
where he may rest with you for all eternity.

01:47.870 --> 01:49.700
His time here is done.

01:49.760 --> 01:53.030
His earthly concerns are cast off.

01:53.100 --> 01:56.920
We offer you the soul of your son michael,

01:57.010 --> 02:00.400
a devoted husband,loving father,

02:00.500 --> 02:05.590
and brave soldier and firefighter in service to his country

02:05.800 --> 02:13.000
and his community with our love,our respect,and our prayers.

02:13.110 --> 02:13.840
Amen.

02:14.020 --> 02:15.800
Amen.Amen.

02:16.710 --> 02:22.840
The family asks you to join them at a reception at the home of janet gavin.

02:22.950 --> 02:24.790
Thank you.

God,they sound so beautiful.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.010
Yeah,I heard that song a million times.

02:45.140 --> 02:46.660
If they could play in-a-gadda-da-vida,

02:46.750 --> 02:49.650
then I might be impressed.

03:18.300 --> 03:21.160
I'm glad you're dead,you son of a bitch!

03:21.620 --> 03:22.800
You...damn...

03:29.180 --> 03:32.130
die,asshole.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.320
You're gonna be late.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.900
And make sure you walk your goddamn pony before you go.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.040
I'm sick of taking care of him.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.180
It's not a pony.

03:45.280 --> 03:48.120
Yeah.If that's a dog,I'm a pink gorilla.

03:48.250 --> 03:50.980
King kong's got her panties in a bunch.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.140
What?

03:52.250 --> 03:53.410
I'm taking him.

Civie thinks it started on the second floor.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.900
There are squatters coming out,probably more inside.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.250
Be a doll and get 'em out,please.

04:56.340 --> 04:58.030
-Our pleasure.
-Thank you.

04:58.140 --> 04:59.510
All right.On in here for you,boys.

04:59.610 --> 05:00.590
She's pretty.

05:00.700 --> 05:01.530
Yeah,she sure is.

05:01.630 --> 05:02.400
Let's go,folks.

05:02.490 --> 05:03.990
Come on,room service.

05:04.660 --> 05:05.610
Hang on,lou.

05:09.870 --> 05:11.180
hello!

05:11.310 --> 05:12.760
We got her.

05:12.850 --> 05:16.000
All right,take her down.Hand her off.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.940
-shit.Shit.
-boys.

05:18.050 --> 05:19.720
No go,guys.

05:19.890 --> 05:20.730
Hallway just went up.

05:20.920 --> 05:21.910
All right.All right.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.230
Hey,uh,chief,we just lost our way out of here.

05:24.340 --> 05:25.670
You got building plans?

05:25.780 --> 05:27.830
You got stairwells on either side of the building.

05:27.930 --> 05:29.350
Can you make it down to the other end?

05:29.470 --> 05:30.870
All right,we'll try it.Copy that.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.340
Boys,we're moving it down this way.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.850
Franco,I got something in here for you.

05:33.980 --> 05:34.880
yeah?

05:34.990 --> 05:36.430
Holy shit.

05:36.690 --> 05:38.310
Beautiful.

05:38.690 --> 05:39.680
Hey,sir?

05:39.790 --> 05:41.620
I need you to come with me.I need you to walk.

05:41.730 --> 05:42.300
Let's go.

05:42.450 --> 05:43.300
Cigarette?

05:43.420 --> 05:44.110
I need you to come on.

05:44.210 --> 05:46.380
Let's go.We're getting out of here.

05:49.150 --> 05:50.060
I think it's welded shut.

05:50.190 --> 05:51.460
It's all good news today,isn't it?

05:51.590 --> 05:53.350
Hey,chief,we're all jammed up here.

05:53.510 --> 05:55.380
We can't go down.How's up looking?

05:55.490 --> 05:56.950
Negative.Do not go up.

05:57.170 --> 05:59.180
They're having trouble knocking this bitch down.

05:59.260 --> 06:02.050
Security says there's a stairwell in the middle of the building.

06:02.140 --> 06:05.080
It is unmarked,so keep your eyes open.

06:05.180 --> 06:06.250
Let's go.Masks on.

06:06.350 --> 06:07.300
Masks on,guys.

06:07.470 --> 06:09.290
-Holy shit.
-Keep moving.

06:09.520 --> 06:10.880
Keep moving.

06:11.030 --> 06:12.660
Here,sir,why don't you take a little bit of air,huh?

06:12.740 --> 06:13.440
You trying to kill me?

06:13.530 --> 06:15.080
Sir,I'm not trying to kill you.I'm trying to help you.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.310
I need you to stay with me,ok?

06:16.410 --> 06:17.530
Back up,asshole!

06:17.640 --> 06:19.220
Hey,guys,I got a situation here.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.240
All right,frank.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.070
-Nice right,franky.
-Thanks.

06:24.180 --> 06:26.970
Help me get this asshole turned over,will you?

06:27.940 --> 06:28.820
Found it.

06:28.890 --> 06:31.250
All right,head on down.We're right behind you.

06:31.770 --> 06:32.820
man.

06:33.570 --> 06:34.460
Shit.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.560
a dead end--just what we need.

06:36.650 --> 06:37.870
I'm gonna check these windows.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.030
All right.

06:39.130 --> 06:41.010
All right,boys,let us find a door,

06:41.100 --> 06:42.670
or we're gonna have to breach a wall.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.860
So,let's get looking.

06:45.020 --> 06:46.890
Hey,found a door over here,lou.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.050
Hey,guys,drop your grabs.Get over here.

06:49.150 --> 06:51.610
Help clear this doorway out.

06:51.790 --> 06:53.250
I think we got a way out,chief,

06:53.320 --> 06:55.790
but keep that ladder coming.

06:55.870 --> 06:57.060
Copy.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.380
Guys,guys,move the shelves,not the boxes.

07:02.470 --> 07:03.810
I told you guys.

07:03.910 --> 07:05.160
-You didn't tell us that.
-You didn't say that.

07:05.260 --> 07:07.990
-Well,I was thinking it.
-Well,next time,speak.Don't think.

07:08.060 --> 07:11.220
Guys,guys,guys,let's just get it done,ok?

07:11.340 --> 07:14.360
Well,they can always go out the windows if he's not gonna-- what are they doing?

07:14.470 --> 07:16.780
those monkeys are clearing the doorway.

07:17.900 --> 07:19.800
All right,hey,guys-- Guys-- Take cover.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.720
Get your grabs down on the ground,all right?

07:30.750 --> 07:32.930
What the hell is that?

07:37.600 --> 07:40.140
Lou,what's going on in there?

07:40.900 --> 07:42.900
Tom--I don't think we can stay here,tommy.

07:42.990 --> 07:43.890
No shit,sherlock.

07:43.980 --> 07:45.540
Lou,what are we doing?

07:45.620 --> 07:47.110
Turn this shit off!

07:47.210 --> 07:48.660
Hey,just relax.Stay calm.

07:48.750 --> 07:50.090
Somebody make it stop!

07:50.200 --> 07:51.240
Hey...

07:51.320 --> 07:52.000
tables.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.310
Tables.Good.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.540
Lou,the ladder's in place.

07:54.620 --> 07:56.450
Can you make it to the window?

07:56.550 --> 07:57.340
Son of a bitch!

07:57.420 --> 08:00.560
Lou,the ladder is up.Copy.

08:00.990 --> 08:02.310
Jesus christ.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.520
Somebody give him a hand.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.160
Lou!

08:12.700 --> 08:14.490
Son of a bitch.

08:21.740 --> 08:23.690
Hey,guys,check it out.

08:23.810 --> 08:25.180
Real nice,tinkerbell.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.040
It's pretty cool,huh?

08:26.060 --> 08:26.990
Get that shit away from me,man.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.360
Half a ton of fireworks,and you go and steal the biggest,

08:30.470 --> 08:33.179
pussyest firework in the history of fireworks,short of the match.

08:33.270 --> 08:36.220
But I like sparklers.They're...sparkly.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.539
You know,and it's kind of cool the way the sparklers shower down,

08:38.620 --> 08:41.070
and it kind of hurts,but it kind of feels good,too.

08:41.159 --> 08:42.919
Just remember they're not for rectal insertion.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.260
You know,I know a guy in high school

08:44.340 --> 08:45.780
once stuck a roman candle in his ass.

08:45.860 --> 08:49.560
And right when he lit it,blew a giant fart.

08:53.950 --> 08:54.680
And?

08:54.790 --> 08:57.260
Nearly singed my eyebrows off.

08:57.340 --> 08:58.390
I'm not even gonna ask.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.160
No,he couldn't do the reach-around by himself,

09:00.260 --> 09:01.720
so I had to,you know,light it for him.

09:01.810 --> 09:02.790
I'm lucky I'm not blind.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.290
Or a proctologist.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.690
I knew a guy in high school lost an eye to a bottle rocket-- tony marchesi.

09:07.790 --> 09:08.820
Now we call him lefty.

09:08.920 --> 09:09.810
Oh,yeah?I got you beat.

09:09.890 --> 09:12.300
My buddy hector blew one of his balls off on cinco de mayo.

09:12.530 --> 09:13.350
Ouch.

09:13.450 --> 09:14.360
What do they call him now?

09:14.500 --> 09:16.170
Han.

09:16.570 --> 09:18.060
Solo.

09:18.170 --> 09:19.300
Right.

09:19.470 --> 09:20.220
I'll tell you later.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.270
Was this one of those roman candle out of the ass tricks gone wrong again?

09:23.350 --> 09:25.040
Yeah,except he pulled a bad candle.

09:25.130 --> 09:27.010
The guy lost a nut and gained a second asshole.

09:27.620 --> 09:29.910
Wait a minute.The guy gains a second asshole,and you call him solo?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.700
Well,we called him two hole for about 6 months,

09:31.780 --> 09:33.250
but then it kind of healed up.But believe me,

09:33.350 --> 09:35.160
the half a ball sack was not pretty.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.480
He showed it to you?

09:36.590 --> 09:37.530
Kind of.

09:37.630 --> 09:38.880
Looked like italy.

09:38.980 --> 09:39.740
Kind of?

09:39.880 --> 09:40.520
Italy?

09:41.230 --> 09:42.420
Is italy,like,big?

09:42.520 --> 09:43.920
Bro,aren't you italian?

09:44.010 --> 09:45.230
I know.I should know this stuff.

09:45.330 --> 09:47.410
All right-- Quick quiz.

09:47.510 --> 09:50.420
You got to pick one,you got to lose one-- ball or eye?

09:50.510 --> 09:51.170
Ball.

09:51.270 --> 09:52.680
Or,no.Eye.

09:52.780 --> 09:53.600
Or ball.

09:53.690 --> 09:55.560
I mean,if you lose an eye,you're not gonna see your balls,

09:55.630 --> 09:56.670
so what's the point of that?

09:56.770 --> 09:58.040
Pause.Pause.Pause.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.570
I have the floor.

09:59.660 --> 10:02.610
Ball--immediately cuts your chances of ball cancer in half.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.230
That's a good point.I'm gonna go ball.

10:04.310 --> 10:06.150
What if you pick the wrong one?

10:06.260 --> 10:08.310
Eye-- definitely eye.

10:08.420 --> 10:09.290
Shawn?

10:09.380 --> 10:09.910
I ain't losing either,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.750
'cause I'm not stupid enough to mess around with fireworks.

10:12.850 --> 10:15.190
Them shits are scary,son.

10:15.340 --> 10:17.940
This is a truck guy who's afraid of fireworks.

10:18.010 --> 10:19.130
M-80s?

10:19.230 --> 10:21.580
Now,y'all know that's not,like,regular fireworks.

10:21.690 --> 10:24.290
Them shits is like,uh,military-type stuff,right?

10:24.370 --> 10:25.450
That's not military-type shit.

10:25.530 --> 10:27.520
When I was growing up,in the morning,in the summertime,

10:27.620 --> 10:29.620
that's how we started the day off--m-80s,ok?

10:29.710 --> 10:31.930
M-80s,bottle rockets,cherry bombs--

10:32.010 --> 10:33.890
we had a guy who left the neighborhood and went to vietnam,

10:33.970 --> 10:35.340
came back.You know what he said?

10:35.430 --> 10:37.620
It was quieter there.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.120
I think I pulled a muscle in my neck.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.200
-Hey,everybody.
-Hey,tommy.

10:44.300 --> 10:44.980
How are you?

10:45.110 --> 10:47.330
A little late for your tour,aren't you,chief?

10:47.450 --> 10:51.700
I didn't get much shuteye last night,on account of a 4 A.M.Call from the marshal--

10:51.800 --> 10:55.740
something about an impromptu fireworks display uptown.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.000
Want to tell me what happened?

10:57.110 --> 10:57.800
What do you want me to say?

10:57.880 --> 11:00.180
Some clown was storing illegal fireworks at a warehouse.

11:00.270 --> 11:03.650
It's not like we were waving flags and roasting weenies in the parking lot.

11:03.730 --> 11:07.290
You know,you can't go storming every abandoned building like it's the goddamn alamo.

11:07.370 --> 11:10.880
Listen,it's the culture of accountability,kiddo,

11:10.960 --> 11:12.480
so you better get your act together.

11:12.560 --> 11:17.440
Let's have no more bullshit around here--no more crazy-ass crap.

11:17.540 --> 11:20.640
Hey,tom,you been working out?

11:20.730 --> 11:22.020
Ye

11:22.430 --> 11:24.380
Lookin' good.

11:25.150 --> 11:26.520
Thanks.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.190
You know,I think he's over the whole section eight thing.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.170
I think he's really taking a liking to me.

11:30.260 --> 11:32.320
You think?

11:32.440 --> 11:33.840
Sure.

11:34.090 --> 11:36.410
What?You guys don't see it?

11:36.490 --> 11:38.150
I'm serious.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.450
Uh,what are you doing here?

11:44.540 --> 11:46.150
Nice to see you,too.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.220
I decided to drop by and say hello to the kids.

11:48.310 --> 11:50.850
That'S...for wyatt...

11:50.920 --> 11:52.390
-Oh,thank you.
-A present.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.620
But we have rules now,tommy.You know that.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.750
ok.The "drop by" days are over for a--what?

11:58.840 --> 12:00.250
Nothing.Just...

12:00.330 --> 12:02.900
So,just,next time that you want to play daddy for a little bit,

12:02.980 --> 12:05.240
-please call first.Ok?
-Well,I forgot to call.

12:05.310 --> 12:06.230
-Can I come in?
-No.

12:06.310 --> 12:08.280
-Thank you.
-Tommy...

12:09.570 --> 12:12.250
You know...

12:12.700 --> 12:16.700
I brought your,uh,monthly little pile of cash.

12:16.790 --> 12:18.010
-Thank you.
-Which reminds me,

12:18.080 --> 12:19.880
I hope you still have that real estate gig going on,

12:19.940 --> 12:22.100
because the way the section eight hearing is shaping up,

12:22.220 --> 12:25.400
you might need the money from your job.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.530
When is the hearing?

12:26.620 --> 12:27.690
Don't know yet.Still waiting to find out.

12:27.770 --> 12:28.680
Where's katy at?

12:28.810 --> 12:33.050
She,uh-- No,she's at--she's at a playdate,which is why you need to call first.

12:33.140 --> 12:35.280
Can we stop using the term "playdate," ok?

12:35.350 --> 12:37.760
A little tired of that--like they're on a date.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.910
When was the last time you were on a date that involved puking and crying

12:40.020 --> 12:42.190
and somebody almost shitting their pants?

12:42.280 --> 12:43.550
Don't answer that.

12:43.660 --> 12:46.550
I'm with you on the playdate thing,brother.

12:50.610 --> 12:52.990
Ye.Uh,tommy...

12:53.080 --> 12:54.120
This is dwight.

12:54.210 --> 12:57.550
Dwight,tommy--my ex.

12:57.630 --> 12:59.960
Well,technically,you know,it'S...

13:00.060 --> 13:02.070
we still have to work that out.

13:02.170 --> 13:06.280
Gonna make things a whole hell of a lot easier for me if you did.

13:06.470 --> 13:07.900
How are you?

13:07.990 --> 13:08.910
I'M...

13:09.000 --> 13:10.160
good.

13:10.270 --> 13:11.900
You're probably expecting to see that guy from janet's work--

13:11.990 --> 13:14.930
that guy with the little cat eyes.But-- Yes,right.

13:15.010 --> 13:17.290
It didn't work out between the two of them.--What was his name?

13:17.390 --> 13:19.830
Never shit where you eat,right?

13:20.180 --> 13:25.290
Yeah,we don't really have to worry about that sort of dating stuff at the firehouse.

13:25.380 --> 13:28.020
Are you a firefighter?

13:29.390 --> 13:31.930
She--she didn't tell you that I was a firefighter?

13:32.010 --> 13:34.620
So,your name doesn't come up much.

13:35.050 --> 13:36.530
Right.

13:36.630 --> 13:38.340
We've been really busy.

13:38.710 --> 13:40.990
Uh,ok.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.260
Ok.

13:42.370 --> 13:44.430
You know,I was thinking about being a firefighter at one point.

13:44.500 --> 13:48.150
Yeah,I mean,everybody does when they're little,but,uh,even when I got older.

13:48.220 --> 13:49.840
But then I was thinking,you know,you guys,what?

13:49.910 --> 13:52.290
You fight fires,like,once,twice a month.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.660
The rest of the time,you're sitting around picking your ass.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.830
I'm an active guY.That wouldn't work for me.

13:56.910 --> 13:58.250
No--no disrespect.

13:58.330 --> 14:01.430
No.None--none taken.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.510
Is this guy a dick,or is it just my imagination?

14:03.590 --> 14:04.510
Time to go.

14:04.590 --> 14:05.610
Hey,you have one of those spotty dogs?

14:05.700 --> 14:07.550
One of those dalmatians?

14:07.640 --> 14:09.590
Do you really let those guys ride around on the truck with you,

14:09.650 --> 14:10.870
or is that just bullshit?

14:10.950 --> 14:12.160
Oh,my god.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.710
So,y-you're busting my balls on purpose,now,right?

14:14.800 --> 14:15.710
That's what we're doing here?

14:15.790 --> 14:19.250
This-- I'm just having fun,just having a laugh,trying to defuse the tension.

14:19.340 --> 14:21.280
I know you guys do god's work.I really do.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.200
God's work.

14:22.290 --> 14:25.570
So,w-what do you do,besides the defusing thing?

14:25.640 --> 14:26.850
Well,I'm into extreme sports.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.360
I mean,I used to be an athlete--not so much anymore.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.650
I'm trying to settle into a new gig.

14:31.770 --> 14:32.660
Hey,pop a squat.

14:32.740 --> 14:34.010
Oh,no,no,no,tommy.

14:34.110 --> 14:34.910
No,no,no.

14:35.050 --> 14:36.720
-You have that thing.
-What thing?

14:36.810 --> 14:38.550
You know.You have that thing,tommy.

14:38.630 --> 14:40.630
You have.He has a thing.-- I have a thing.

14:40.720 --> 14:41.570
Ok.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.960
Take it easy with the thing,brother.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.090
Ok.All right.

14:45.190 --> 14:47.250
Get a doggy bone for me,will you?

14:47.340 --> 14:48.190
Nice to meet you.

14:48.270 --> 14:49.570
I like dogs.

14:49.670 --> 14:51.170
They do shit where they eat,though.

14:51.260 --> 14:53.640
He still busting my balls?

14:55.900 --> 14:58.290
Mike, you can't give it away.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.770
I can, too. It's my inheritance.

14:59.850 --> 15:03.280
Bro, who gives away their inheritance? Assholes.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.440
-Shitheads.
-Yeah, shitheads

15:04.560 --> 15:05.990
and assholes--both of which you are,

15:06.010 --> 15:09.080
by the way.But right now,you got a shot at actually changing that.

15:09.190 --> 15:10.700
I don't like having that money,you know.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.990
God,it's just a shitty reminder that my mom's dead.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.000
Mike,you give the money away,your mom's still gonna be dead.

15:15.100 --> 15:15.940
And you're gonna be broke.

15:16.000 --> 15:16.580
And sorry.

15:16.670 --> 15:18.950
Sorry that you didn't listen to your friends when they told you not to be an asshole.

15:19.030 --> 15:20.560
-Or a shithead.
-See?

15:20.640 --> 15:25.020
no.Well,I already promised the cancer society,you know.

15:25.140 --> 15:30.280
Cancer society-- what's the cancer society gonna cure with your measly $100,000?

15:30.380 --> 15:32.220
-It's 150,actually.
-Really?

15:32.300 --> 15:35.250
You give the money to those guys,you know what they're gonna use it for?

15:35.340 --> 15:36.050
Research?

15:36.140 --> 15:39.130
Postage--to send letters out to other people to get more money.

15:39.220 --> 15:40.590
It's a vicious cycle,mike--

15:40.680 --> 15:43.620
not to mention the fact that they're never gonna find a cure,because there isn't one.

15:43.680 --> 15:44.890
Because cancer is god's disease.

15:44.970 --> 15:47.000
It's his way of thinning out the herd.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.540
And it's cruel and mysterious,and no one's ever gonna figure it out,

15:49.620 --> 15:52.400
because that's the way god likes it.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.630
So...

15:53.730 --> 15:56.060
what am I gonna do with the money?

15:56.150 --> 15:58.160
I got an idea.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.130
What if...

16:00.270 --> 16:02.560
we get a place like this?

16:03.750 --> 16:04.410
You mean,a bar?

16:04.510 --> 16:07.240
A bar--a bar like this.But why do we come here?

16:07.320 --> 16:08.370
It's a firefighter's bar.

16:08.450 --> 16:11.440
Exactly--it's a firefighter bar,owned by a firefighter.

16:11.510 --> 16:12.580
Mario says it's a gold mine.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.570
It's,like,the best investment he's ever made.

16:14.630 --> 16:16.240
All you gotta do is kick the old-timers out.

16:16.340 --> 16:19.330
And the chicks,they flock to firefighter bars like geese--

16:19.420 --> 16:23.070
Smokin' hot,drunk-as-shit geese just waiting to drop their panties for us.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.440
Exactly.And the best part is,once you get the chicks in here,

16:25.520 --> 16:27.390
then the guys show up,wanting to buy the chicks drinks,right?

16:27.460 --> 16:30.590
Mario says it's,like,8 bucks a pop to buy drinks,and these jerks actually pay for it,

16:30.650 --> 16:32.930
thinking that they're gonna score--which they usually do,by the way.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.330
So,at the end of the day,what happens?

16:34.400 --> 16:35.640
We get rich and we get laid.

16:35.700 --> 16:38.030
It's win-win.

16:38.490 --> 16:42.970
Well,if I'm providing the money,then what are you guys bringing to the table?

16:43.860 --> 16:48.970
dude,I got my associate's degree from scranton,almost.

16:49.060 --> 16:50.670
I would provide the business savvy.

16:50.750 --> 16:52.350
You would be the money.I would be the brains.

16:52.410 --> 16:53.240
Got it?

16:53.320 --> 16:53.960
Wait a second.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.260
If your dumb ass is the brains,then what the hell does that make me?

16:56.350 --> 16:59.080
Well,we're gonna need a bouncer,for sure.

16:59.150 --> 17:01.800
I mean,mike's the money,I'm brains,you would be the brawn.

17:01.870 --> 17:03.240
Wh-why do I gotta be the brawn?

17:03.310 --> 17:05.780
First of all,lou told me what you did to that bum in a fire the other day.

17:05.859 --> 17:06.530
-Yeah.
-Nice work.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.310
Secondly,you know,you're big.

17:08.390 --> 17:09.740
You're puerto rican.

17:09.890 --> 17:10.890
You're kind of scary.

17:10.990 --> 17:12.400
I mean,who's gonna mess around in a bar with a big,giant,

17:12.480 --> 17:14.760
scary puerto rican guy standing in the door,you know?

17:14.829 --> 17:16.869
Except,maybe other puerto ricans,but let's be honest.

17:16.940 --> 17:18.780
We're not gonna let them in.

17:19.060 --> 17:20.810
Whatever,man.Give me any title you want.

17:20.869 --> 17:23.890
I just want to be around to watch you two humps sink this goddamn ship.

17:23.950 --> 17:26.069
All right,what do you say,mike?

17:26.160 --> 17:29.220
As long as I get to name the place.

17:29.550 --> 17:30.780
No.

17:31.270 --> 17:32.000
Ok.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.250
-You're in?Deal?
-Yeah.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.660
All right.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.640
So,he's sitting there on the couch,right--the couch I paid for,by the way.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.560
Doesn't even get up to greet me--sticks his hand in the air,

17:42.630 --> 17:43.480
like I'm supposed to cross the room

17:43.550 --> 17:48.130
and greet him like he's the pope or goddamn michael corleone or something.

17:48.810 --> 17:52.260
Maybe he felt threatened or uncomfortable or something.

17:52.860 --> 17:53.440
I don't know.

17:53.540 --> 17:57.490
Then he says he was an extreme sports guy-- extreme prick is more like it.

17:57.580 --> 17:59.450
Yeah,well,janet always knew how to pick 'em.

17:59.490 --> 18:00.480
Yeah,well,I'll tell you one thing.

18:00.530 --> 18:03.870
When I go over there next time,he better get up off his ass and come over and shake my hand.

18:03.930 --> 18:05.580
Otherwise,I'm taking him outside and throwing a beating into him.

18:05.650 --> 18:08.680
Did I tell you about the dalmatians?

18:11.690 --> 18:13.780
You want to go to teddy and ellie's tomorrow night?

18:13.870 --> 18:14.990
I don't know.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.920
Well,listen,maggie found-- when she was going through some of your father's old stuff--

18:17.980 --> 18:19.870
found a bunch of old home movies.

18:19.940 --> 18:20.940
It'll be fun.

18:21.010 --> 18:23.390
We'll have a gavin family film festival.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.400
You gotta come.Come on.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.360
No.I'm not coming...

18:26.440 --> 18:27.590
funny.

18:27.690 --> 18:28.640
Thank you.

18:28.810 --> 18:33.160
Last thing before we wrap up--anybody want to volunteer to be a sponsor?

18:33.240 --> 18:35.350
We have some of our newer members who are looking.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.720
If you like to help out,let's see some hands.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.180
Why don't you get your hand up?

18:40.260 --> 18:41.200
What are you,nuts?

18:41.300 --> 18:43.380
I'm not ready to be a sponsor.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.830
Well,you got some time clean.I mean,come on.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.380
You're solid.

18:47.480 --> 18:50.710
It might do you some good to think about somebody else other than yourself for a change.

18:50.770 --> 18:51.660
Get your hand up.

18:51.740 --> 18:53.270
Well...

18:53.380 --> 18:55.560
I'm already thinking about her.

18:55.670 --> 18:56.660
Look around.

18:56.780 --> 18:59.760
See if you see someone that you might want to sponsor you.

18:59.930 --> 19:03.520
And after the meeting,you can all talk.

19:06.870 --> 19:08.990
No,no.

19:13.180 --> 19:17.720
I do believe someone's got an overdue book and should be punished.

19:18.220 --> 19:19.230
I kept it for months.

19:22.810 --> 19:24.220
What?

19:24.370 --> 19:26.420
I believe--you know,I'm not into this.

19:26.510 --> 19:28.680
I think-- I think this is actually kind of boring.

19:28.770 --> 19:29.700
-It is lame.
-This is good.

19:29.860 --> 19:30.870
And I can'T.I'm sorry.

19:30.940 --> 19:32.890
He's just staring at us.

19:34.050 --> 19:35.850
Get out of there.

19:35.940 --> 19:38.010
Go.Get out of here.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.640
You know?

19:39.740 --> 19:40.910
Hit me with the ruler.

19:40.990 --> 19:41.530
What?

19:41.630 --> 19:44.430
I've been bad.Hit me with the ruler.

19:44.510 --> 19:45.190
Come on.

19:45.320 --> 19:49.010
Someone's been bad,i believe,and they need to be hit with a ruler.

19:49.120 --> 19:49.880
Ok,good.

19:49.970 --> 19:51.320
A little harder,ok?

19:51.410 --> 19:53.590
Like,draw blood.Try to draw blood.You know?

19:53.700 --> 19:56.300
You don't actually have to make me bleed,but just-- You know?

19:56.400 --> 19:57.440
I-I'm not into this.

19:57.540 --> 19:58.700
I think this is--uh-uh.

19:58.800 --> 19:59.530
I'm sorry.

19:59.850 --> 20:00.760
I'm not into this.

20:00.840 --> 20:01.620
I think this is stupid.

20:01.700 --> 20:02.890
I'm going to take a shower.

20:02.990 --> 20:04.240
I'm done.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.090
Hello?

20:08.190 --> 20:09.920
Hey,col.It's dad.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.240
What,did you forget to look at the number before you answered?

20:13.330 --> 20:16.750
I was actually expecting another call--a very urgent one.

20:16.840 --> 20:17.840
From who?

20:18.100 --> 20:19.470
That's the other line now.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.890
You know,honey,I know this trick.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.350
I'll call you back.

20:22.450 --> 20:23.710
Bye.

20:23.840 --> 20:24.790
Bye.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.430
Was that him?

20:29.240 --> 20:31.170
He needs to know.

20:31.260 --> 20:32.290
No,he doesn'T.

20:32.380 --> 20:34.100
This shit is crazy.I...

20:34.190 --> 20:36.640
I think we just got to come out and just tell him.

20:36.720 --> 20:37.440
I'm willing to tell him.

20:37.500 --> 20:41.480
Baby,if that's what you want to do,then I'm not gonna try-- It's what I gotta do.

20:41.560 --> 20:42.770
Yes.

20:42.870 --> 20:45.270
How do you want me to dispose of your remains?

20:45.380 --> 20:48.150
Come on.I'm not afraid of your pops.Please.

20:48.250 --> 20:50.960
Tommy and me,we have this mutual respect thing going,all right?

20:51.050 --> 20:52.810
And I just want to respect the respect.

20:52.890 --> 20:55.380
You're the man's daughter.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.740
And you're sweet.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.220
And I know this.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.760
I just rigged the trunk of black shawn's car with a bunch of fireworks.

21:05.840 --> 21:09.770
When he throws his stuff in,it's gonna go off like mount vesuvius.

21:09.850 --> 21:12.540
You know,feinberg's been on your ass ever since you came into this house because of your age--

21:12.630 --> 21:14.500
our age.He thinks you're too young to be a chief.

21:14.580 --> 21:18.500
You're supposed to be establishing yourself as an authority figure.

21:18.870 --> 21:19.900
You want to watch,or what?

21:19.990 --> 21:21.090
Yeah.

21:21.260 --> 21:22.010
Hey,tom.

21:22.120 --> 21:22.620
Hey.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.100
You get a haircut?

21:24.200 --> 21:25.120
No.

21:25.710 --> 21:27.350
Later,guys.

21:27.570 --> 21:29.180
You're really looking good.

21:29.270 --> 21:30.950
Heard you had a nice,quiet day.

21:31.040 --> 21:31.790
We--we did.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.330
Good boy.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.790
Did he just "good game" you?

21:37.890 --> 21:38.790
Yeah.

21:39.070 --> 21:40.560
Oh,you're so dead.

21:42.060 --> 21:43.950
Aw,shit.It's sheila.

21:44.120 --> 21:44.810
Holy shit!

21:44.900 --> 21:45.700
I can't talk right now.

21:45.790 --> 21:47.150
Oh,no,no,no.I need to see you.

21:47.240 --> 21:47.780
No.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.040
It's s an emergency.

21:49.140 --> 21:50.630
Are you on fire?

21:51.040 --> 21:51.590
No.

21:51.690 --> 21:53.810
Well,I know you're not choking to death,because you're talking to me on the phone.

21:53.900 --> 21:55.230
Although,I suppose anything's possible.

21:55.330 --> 21:57.410
Are you being held hostage?

21:57.500 --> 21:58.540
Hello?

21:58.670 --> 22:03.750
Somebody called me from your headquarters about your section five thingy.

22:03.850 --> 22:04.410
Eight.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.170
Five,eight,big diff.

22:06.280 --> 22:07.680
Uh,I need to see you right away.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.990
It's urgent.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.140
Ah,all right,I'm coming.

22:13.730 --> 22:17.180
Do you know how much 2 years' tuition at nyu costs?

22:17.270 --> 22:18.640
It costs over 80 grand.

22:18.730 --> 22:20.950
Right?That kid is not dropping out.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.120
I do not know what the hell has gotten into damian.

22:23.220 --> 22:26.240
All right,I know I'm not mother of the year or anything,

22:26.310 --> 22:30.200
but I thought that I taught him enough sense to know that he has to have an education.

22:30.260 --> 22:32.270
He can't be a dropout.What's he gonna do?

22:32.360 --> 22:33.950
He's gonna drive a goddamn garbage truck?

22:34.030 --> 22:37.110
Is this the urgent shit that you had to talk to me face to face about?--Yes,it is.

22:37.210 --> 22:40.020
What about the section eight guy?Is that--yeah.Bullshit,ok?

22:40.120 --> 22:40.850
Let me tell you something.

22:40.930 --> 22:41.880
Damian's old enough to vote.

22:41.970 --> 22:42.900
He's old enough to go to war.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.690
He's old enough to make his own decisions.All right?

22:44.770 --> 22:46.850
So,I...

22:46.980 --> 22:47.860
you're texting?

22:47.950 --> 22:50.220
What?No.

22:50.520 --> 22:51.860
Yeah.

22:52.150 --> 22:53.040
You're unbelievable.

22:53.130 --> 22:55.460
You know,you're always giving me shit about how my A.D.D.

22:55.550 --> 22:58.380
-- I can't have a conversation with you without thinking about something else.

22:58.490 --> 23:01.600
And meanwhile,you can't even enga

23:01.700 --> 23:03.500
-you're texting again.
-No.I'm not texting.

23:03.610 --> 23:05.220
I'M...

23:05.340 --> 23:07.420
-What?
-I'm taking notes.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.470
Taking notes for what?

23:08.550 --> 23:10.360
My class.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.680
What class?

23:11.800 --> 23:12.870
A drama class.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.250
You're taking an acting class?

23:14.350 --> 23:15.350
I'M...

23:15.440 --> 23:17.980
You're--and you're lying about it.

23:18.070 --> 23:19.960
No.I'm not--I'm not-- no,no...

23:20.280 --> 23:25.940
it is a drama slash acting slash therapy class.

23:26.050 --> 23:26.820
All right?

23:26.920 --> 23:28.210
All right.

23:28.480 --> 23:29.750
Bye.

23:29.870 --> 23:30.900
Just--sit down!

23:31.000 --> 23:31.860
Listen.It's different.

23:31.950 --> 23:33.440
It's a different kind of therapy,ok?

23:33.540 --> 23:38.410
He's what you call a psychodramatist--or a psycho...

23:38.540 --> 23:44.400
dramaturgist--or he practices psychodramaturgy.

23:44.500 --> 23:45.980
You staring at my tits?

23:46.090 --> 23:47.890
ye

23:48.570 --> 23:50.640
-psycho...
-Ok,all right.

23:50.740 --> 23:59.320
So,um,it's about healing fractured relationships by reenacting pivotal moments in my life.

23:59.450 --> 24:04.980
And it's about my issues with damian,with jimmy,and with my parents.

24:05.080 --> 24:06.870
So,it's about me,really.

24:06.970 --> 24:08.360
Not about--no.

24:08.770 --> 24:09.670
Yeah,it's about me.

24:09.760 --> 24:10.630
No,it is not about you.

24:10.730 --> 24:11.460
Oh,ok.

24:11.550 --> 24:12.180
That's great.

24:12.270 --> 24:14.030
You know,um,speaking of issues,

24:14.120 --> 24:16.620
there's an issue of sports illustrated back at the firehouse that has my name on it.

24:16.710 --> 24:18.160
-That's interesting.
-Yeah,it is actually.

24:18.420 --> 24:19.490
It's very interesting,actually.

24:19.580 --> 24:20.690
I think brett favre is on the cover.

24:20.790 --> 24:22.360
What are you--are you gonna take a note about brett favre?

24:22.450 --> 24:25.930
Yeah,no.I'm actually gonna take a note about how it's so not about you.

24:26.030 --> 24:27.730
Ok.

24:28.620 --> 24:30.260
Really?My tits again?

24:30.340 --> 24:32.020
I glanced.Yeah.

24:32.090 --> 24:36.430
Don't wear the necklace that points down at the...

24:36.550 --> 24:41.930
I know how much you need me,and in know how hard it is to live without me,

24:42.010 --> 24:49.490
but I gotta think about what's best for me for a change--my wants,my feelings,my needs.

24:49.590 --> 24:53.930
And I value our friendship,and I do want us to be a part of each other's lives.

24:54.020 --> 24:59.780
But sleeping together is not something that I can do right now.

24:59.890 --> 25:00.950
Oh,christ,tommy.

25:01.020 --> 25:01.870
Don't be like that.

25:01.970 --> 25:03.130
Whatever.

25:03.240 --> 25:06.070
Will you just,for once,please just say what you feel?

25:06.170 --> 25:07.560
I don't think so.

25:07.660 --> 25:10.490
Uhh,god!You are such an insensitive little bitch!

25:10.580 --> 25:12.910
I could totally just strangle you right now,tommy!

25:13.000 --> 25:13.890
I hate you!

25:13.980 --> 25:15.030
Tommy,I hate you!

25:15.160 --> 25:16.850
You suck!

25:20.690 --> 25:23.070
How did that feel?

25:23.200 --> 25:26.160
That felt really good.

25:26.280 --> 25:27.590
Can we do it again?

25:30.980 --> 25:33.190
Are you staring at my tits?

25:33.280 --> 25:35.860
Tommy's staring at your tits.

25:41.730 --> 25:43.980
Hey,lou...

25:44.240 --> 25:45.410
can I get your ear on something?

25:45.500 --> 25:46.810
Yeah.What's up?

25:46.900 --> 25:49.290
You and tommy--you're tight.

25:49.410 --> 25:50.680
Well,if you mean we're close,yeah.

25:50.760 --> 25:55.360
In terms of actual tightness,I can only speak for myself.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.480
So,if tommy were to find out that one of the guys in the crew

25:58.590 --> 26:00.460
was doing something behind his back that

26:00.550 --> 26:02.620
he might not be so-- Oh,my god.You're sleeping with colleen.

26:02.720 --> 26:03.510
How did you know?

26:03.620 --> 26:04.170
I'm right?

26:04.270 --> 26:05.240
So,is that bad?

26:05.360 --> 26:08.460
I-it could only be worse if you were banng katy.

26:08.530 --> 26:09.650
Tell me you're not banging katy.

26:09.910 --> 26:11.200
Of course not.

26:11.310 --> 26:12.850
I'm not banging either one of them.

26:12.940 --> 26:14.220
Wait a minute.You just said you were sleeping with colleen.

26:14.330 --> 26:15.000
I am.

26:15.090 --> 26:16.220
So?

26:16.320 --> 26:20.360
Well,we're sleeping together,but we're not,you know.

26:20.550 --> 26:23.280
H,I see.So,you're not,like...

26:23.670 --> 26:25.080
No.No.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.200
-None of that going on?
-No.

26:26.310 --> 26:29.420
And if we ever do,I pray it won't look or sound anything like that.

26:29.520 --> 26:30.920
Well,so,what's the deal?

26:31.020 --> 26:33.330
Tommy's gonna kill you,anyway,for just seeing her.

26:33.430 --> 26:35.380
I mean,you might as well get a little piece before you go.

26:35.500 --> 26:36.820
Those days for me are over.

26:36.930 --> 26:38.980
What,your "getting laid" days?

26:39.080 --> 26:41.470
Listen,lou,there's something you need to know about your man shawn.

26:42.030 --> 26:45.770
I've tapped plenty of ass in my day--good ass,and usually pretty quick.

26:45.870 --> 26:48.780
The quicker I tap it,the quicker I'm out the door.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.890
I'm looking for a real relationship here.

26:50.980 --> 26:52.470
You know,I...

26:52.580 --> 26:54.230
want the sex to have value.

26:54.340 --> 26:56.770
Well,your life's on the line.That's valuable.

26:56.860 --> 27:00.850
Come on.You're telling me you've never had a relationship where you waited to have sex?

27:00.950 --> 27:02.950
Not on purpose.No.

27:03.050 --> 27:04.330
Well...

27:04.440 --> 27:06.210
this is on purpose.

27:06.340 --> 27:11.100
The next ass I tap is the ass I marry.

27:11.320 --> 27:12.350
That's sweet.

27:12.470 --> 27:14.550
I'd like to see that on a sampler.

27:14.640 --> 27:16.620
But I would leave tommy out of it.

27:16.730 --> 27:20.810
It's gonna be really hard to tap that ass from beyond the grave.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.230
Hey.

27:29.720 --> 27:30.500
Hey,tom.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.960
How you doing?

27:32.110 --> 27:32.710
Fine.

27:32.800 --> 27:33.990
How is your day?

27:34.100 --> 27:34.870
It's good.

27:34.970 --> 27:36.460
How's your day?

27:36.590 --> 27:37.430
Spectacular.

27:37.530 --> 27:38.580
That's cool.

27:38.830 --> 27:42.070
Um,did you see that catch that david wright made?

27:42.210 --> 27:43.780
It was,like,the lead thing on sportscenter?

27:43.860 --> 27:48.830
By the way--that,um,section eight review...

27:48.940 --> 27:49.670
Yeah?

27:49.770 --> 27:52.930
Set for tuesday,3:00.

27:53.030 --> 27:54.830
Try not to be late.

28:10.200 --> 28:11.590
Tommy...

28:11.830 --> 28:14.390
look at how cute tommy was.

28:15.180 --> 28:16.490
What happened?

28:19.280 --> 28:21.360
Oh,my god.Mickey,that's-- that's your dog.

28:21.460 --> 28:22.500
What was his name?

28:22.600 --> 28:24.400
Her name--bootsie.

28:25.780 --> 28:28.840
Of course,she had those little black feet like boots.

28:29.010 --> 28:32.240
-Bootsie.
-Oh,my god.

28:32.370 --> 28:34.370
Haven't thought of her in a million years.

28:34.460 --> 28:35.890
Good dog.

28:35.990 --> 28:37.770
Look at johnny.

28:37.860 --> 28:41.570
He was always so serious,even as a toddler.

28:41.690 --> 28:44.550
Oh,there's pops.

28:44.690 --> 28:45.910
Hi,pops.

28:46.020 --> 28:47.380
Look at that twinkle in his eye.

28:47.490 --> 28:48.830
I miss him.

28:48.930 --> 28:50.980
He always had that.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.340
Tommy,you want to get the lights?

29:00.230 --> 29:01.370
Oh,boy.

29:01.470 --> 29:02.710
He was a good man.

29:02.830 --> 29:03.880
The besT.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Solid as a rock.

29:05.110 --> 29:06.440
All right,guys.

29:11.220 --> 29:12.070
What?

29:12.170 --> 29:13.840
You got nothing to say?

29:13.950 --> 29:16.870
Well--well I thought they were pretty cool.

29:16.980 --> 29:18.540
I--I don't know what you want me to say.

29:18.620 --> 29:24.270
Yeah,yeah,tommy,we all really want to hear what you're thinking and feeling right now,yeah.

29:24.390 --> 29:26.050
Ok.

29:26.550 --> 29:29.290
I think I'm watching a bunch of...

29:29.390 --> 29:33.940
assholes get teary-eyed about maybe the biggest asshole in the history of assholes.

29:34.890 --> 29:35.800
Ah-- Ok.

29:35.900 --> 29:39.180
Uh,tommy,I really don't think that that is in the spirit of this evening.

29:39.260 --> 29:41.010
Listen,I'm not one of these guys that thinks somebody's a saint

29:41.100 --> 29:43.190
just because all of a sudden,they kicked the bucket,you know what I mean?

29:43.270 --> 29:45.850
It's like when you would see those celebrities showing up on,like,david letterman and say,

29:45.920 --> 29:47.040
"oh,I'm having a baby." You know?

29:47.140 --> 29:51.030
Everybody goes crazy in the audience,like she just pulled a rabbit out of her pussy on live tv.

29:51.130 --> 29:53.360
You know,it's not that spe--everybody has babies.

29:53.450 --> 29:54.560
Everybody dies.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.280
It's not,you know--what?

29:57.390 --> 29:58.720
So,what's your point,tom?

29:58.810 --> 30:03.330
My point is,my dad was many things--chief among them,for me,a giant pain in my balls.

30:03.420 --> 30:06.700
I mean,you know,he never once told me,"hey,tommy,you know,I hear you're a great fireman.

30:06.790 --> 30:08.590
I'm so proud of you,son.

30:08.680 --> 30:09.280
" You know?

30:09.390 --> 30:12.110
"Hell of a hockey player,tom,from what I hear,even though I don't go to your games,

30:12.210 --> 30:13.590
and even though I could a couple of times.

30:13.670 --> 30:14.420
" But you know what I mean?

30:14.500 --> 30:17.970
It's just--not even once did he ever say to me,"hey,you know what?

30:18.140 --> 30:19.950
Tom,you're a great baseball player,you know?

30:20.030 --> 30:21.790
You remind me a freddy lynn with that swing.

30:21.870 --> 30:24.440
" That's because you're a pretty shitty baseball player.

30:24.540 --> 30:27.990
289 my last year in little league,ok?

30:28.090 --> 30:29.060
That's not the point.

30:29.470 --> 30:32.730
The point is,listen--46 years with this guy,

30:32.800 --> 30:37.600
and he waits until we're at a baseball game,and I get 6 innings of niceness from him.

30:37.670 --> 30:42.750
I get 6 innings,and he gives me that much--finally,that.

30:42.830 --> 30:48.300
that's as close as I got to some kind of a connection.

30:48.390 --> 30:50.050
And then what does he do?Drops dead.

30:50.140 --> 30:53.190
You know,it's so funny,because,you know,you could kill your own mother

30:53.280 --> 30:55.890
and hollow out her head and smoke crack out of the skull.

30:55.990 --> 30:58.070
And then if you drop dead from a heart attack,they put you in a box and say,"

30:58.310 --> 31:00.580
She loved her mother.

31:02.380 --> 31:04.300
" Bootsie

31:05.930 --> 31:07.670
You know what?Let me tell you something about bootsie.

31:07.770 --> 31:09.850
Bootsie was a bitch.

31:09.940 --> 31:10.700
That's what bootsie was.

31:10.790 --> 31:13.850
Bootsie was a fat-assed,shedding bitch.

31:13.930 --> 31:14.670
That's what she was.

31:14.770 --> 31:16.530
Remember when she used to shit in the pantry?

31:16.620 --> 31:20.720
Like,every 3 days,she'd go in the pantry and take a big,steaming bootsie-shit.

31:20.830 --> 31:21.920
And then,you know,you watch tv,

31:22.010 --> 31:24.180
you go in to get a little something to eat,like some cheese-its or something,

31:24.270 --> 31:26.890
and you step into a pile of bootsie shit!

31:26.980 --> 31:27.520
Yeah.

31:27.610 --> 31:28.190
Right.

31:28.290 --> 31:30.470
But nobody remembers that anymore."Oh,bootsie.

31:30.540 --> 31:34.780
" You know,why don't you all get up and go in the pantry and just piss and shit your brains out?

31:34.860 --> 31:35.370
'Cause you know what?

31:35.460 --> 31:38.330
If you drop dead tomorrow,nobody's gonna remember that.

31:38.420 --> 31:40.260
No.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.630
We're all bootsie.

31:48.270 --> 31:51.150
Good night,assholes.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.900
thank god you're here,tom.

31:59.990 --> 32:00.850
He's gone mad.

32:00.950 --> 32:02.260
Well,jesus,christ.

32:02.360 --> 32:03.370
Sorry.

32:03.980 --> 32:04.890
I'll be right back.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.250
And I'm here to tell you something--it's all a pack of lies.

32:08.360 --> 32:12.860
So,you might as just well take that baby home and...

32:12.980 --> 32:17.020
I don't know.Stick him in the tub or something.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.460
Don't worry.

32:20.540 --> 32:23.240
It's just-- it was just bread.

32:25.630 --> 32:27.790
Hey,mick.

32:28.390 --> 32:30.250
Hey,tom.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.140
You,uh,you want to...

32:35.240 --> 32:37.450
go for a walk?

32:38.260 --> 32:39.440
Yeah.

32:41.050 --> 32:44.170
This place is dry,anyway.

32:52.490 --> 32:55.140
Congratulations on the baby.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.350
All right.

33:03.460 --> 33:05.500
So,let'S...

33:05.610 --> 33:07.920
let's get going.

33:08.330 --> 33:09.540
Come on.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.590
You don't want to do that.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.420
This is my bender.

33:13.520 --> 33:17.040
It's over when I say it's over.

33:19.360 --> 33:21.880
Lighten up,cuz,will you?

33:21.990 --> 33:23.750
Yeah.

33:27.500 --> 33:30.410
That's the beautiful thing about the program--

33:30.500 --> 33:35.660
take a tumble,get up,you dust yourself off,they let you right back in the club.

33:35.760 --> 33:41.010
No penalties,no judgment,no fines--absolute forgiveness.

33:41.100 --> 33:42.080
Yep.

33:42.180 --> 33:43.440
Plus coffee and snacks.

33:43.540 --> 33:45.460
Careful.

33:49.880 --> 33:52.900
So,I come out of the house this morning.

33:52.990 --> 33:56.230
There's this dog in the street.

33:56.330 --> 33:58.600
Along comes this suv.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.680
Bam.

34:00.960 --> 34:03.630
I run over.I scoop the dog up in my arms.

34:03.730 --> 34:07.260
I mean,I run to the nearest vet.

34:07.350 --> 34:10.770
Dog dies before I get 2 blocks.

34:10.860 --> 34:15.110
So,I'm looking down at the dog in my arms.

34:15.300 --> 34:17.909
And I start thinking of...

34:18.000 --> 34:21.250
I start thinking about my bootsie.

34:24.409 --> 34:25.800
Bootsie the pantry shitter?

34:26.000 --> 34:28.530
She only shit the pantry once,god damn it.

34:28.650 --> 34:30.530
I-I'm pretty sure it was more than once.

34:30.630 --> 34:31.630
Ok?

34:31.739 --> 34:34.760
I'm holding this dead dog...

34:35.850 --> 34:38.250
and I look up.

34:38.380 --> 34:41.389
I see this liquor store across the street.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.699
I mean,it's glowing.

34:42.780 --> 34:47.120
It's beautiful--like a sign from god.

34:47.219 --> 34:51.360
Going into it seemed like the thing to do.

34:51.870 --> 34:55.969
And later,I saw those people going into the church like sheep,

34:56.070 --> 34:59.630
and I just--oh,god,I had to tell them.

34:59.720 --> 35:02.250
It's all a crock of shit.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.070
Nobody gets saveD.

35:06.400 --> 35:09.970
Now that I think about it...

35:11.650 --> 35:14.320
bootsie shit in that pantry at least 3 times.

35:14.420 --> 35:15.650
I'm telling you-- It was once.

35:15.740 --> 35:16.850
Ok-- One goddamn time.

35:16.960 --> 35:18.780
It was the fourth of july barbecue.

35:18.870 --> 35:21.330
Remember,it was somebody's birthday or-- Oh,will you shut up?

35:21.430 --> 35:22.830
Please.

35:24.260 --> 35:26.330
You know,it's like you said.

35:26.420 --> 35:29.280
None of it matters what we do in this life,

35:29.390 --> 35:33.520
who we hurt,the damage we do,the lies we tell.

35:33.630 --> 35:37.760
I mean,unless you push it to extremes--I mean,you're hitler on one side,you're christ on the other.

35:37.860 --> 35:39.860
Nobody cares.

35:39.970 --> 35:49.420
We're all just tiny specks of vapor in the vast,infinitesimal,filth-ridden slurry of human experience.

35:49.520 --> 35:50.390
Ok.

35:50.470 --> 35:57.110
First of all,I never mentioned hitler or christ,and I've never used the word "slurry" in my life.

35:57.210 --> 35:57.900
All right?

35:58.030 --> 35:59.390
But I understand what you're trying to say.

35:59.490 --> 36:00.820
You're trying to say that this is my fault.

36:00.910 --> 36:01.940
That's where you're going.

36:02.030 --> 36:03.350
No,that's not what I'm trying to say.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.660
-That is exactly what you're trying to say.-No,it isn't what I'm trying to say.

36:05.970 --> 36:07.050
I bought the booze.

36:07.140 --> 36:08.240
I went into the liquor store.

36:08.490 --> 36:09.880
I made a scene at that church.

36:09.980 --> 36:12.670
I take responsibility for my own actions.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.850
But it is kind of your fault.

36:14.950 --> 36:16.210
How?How is it my fault?

36:16.300 --> 36:20.690
If you'd just keep your goddamn mouth shut about my poor dog shitting in the pantry all those times.

36:20.790 --> 36:21.540
"All those.

36:21.630 --> 36:22.560
" "All those times.

36:22.650 --> 36:23.560
" That's what I was looking for.

36:23.650 --> 36:25.780
Oh,shut up.

36:28.420 --> 36:33.640
As far as I'm concerned,"all" implies at least 3 times.

36:39.880 --> 36:42.710
This is sad.

36:44.240 --> 36:44.950
Look.

36:45.050 --> 36:46.360
I may have overstated it when I said bootsie was a bitch.

36:46.450 --> 36:51.640
There were times when the dog-- No.

36:51.750 --> 36:55.780
I'm not getting any drunker.

36:55.870 --> 36:57.340
I'm done.

36:57.450 --> 36:58.990
Yeah?

36:59.090 --> 36:59.950
All right.

37:00.050 --> 37:01.950
Let's go.

37:02.340 --> 37:03.330
-Hey,tom?
-Yeah.

37:03.420 --> 37:04.540
-Did you hear?
-What?

37:04.620 --> 37:06.060
Mike,franco,and I-- Yeah?

37:06.150 --> 37:07.120
We're buying a bar.

37:07.230 --> 37:10.370
Uh,correction--mike bought the bar,and I'm watching garrity screw it up.

37:10.470 --> 37:11.650
No,it's gonna be awesome.

37:11.760 --> 37:14.280
And if you have any suggestions,tom,we're totally open.

37:14.370 --> 37:15.230
Oh,cool.

37:15.330 --> 37:16.190
Yeah,I got a couple.

37:16.290 --> 37:17.670
You know,build it on the edge of a cliff,

37:17.770 --> 37:21.400
and go inside and start fixing it up,and then pay somebody to come along and just push it over the side.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.150
Save you a lot of time and money.

37:23.240 --> 37:27.910
Yeah,well,that actually is not gonna work,'cause we're opening it in the city.

37:35.940 --> 37:37.450
I love it.

37:37.580 --> 37:39.130
Enough is enough.

37:39.230 --> 37:40.400
That shit ain't funny anymore.

37:40.480 --> 37:41.190
Pretty funny.

37:41.280 --> 37:42.000
Come on,you guys,huh?

37:42.080 --> 37:46.300
I told you to cut out this shit with the cherry bombs before you set this joint on fire.

37:46.390 --> 37:47.540
Wouldn't be the first time.

37:47.630 --> 37:48.540
Actually,it would be the fourth.

37:48.640 --> 37:49.340
Yeah.

37:49.660 --> 37:50.800
Look at that.

37:51.340 --> 37:52.910
There's gonna be a visitor in the house.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.130
It's a french lady.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.010
She's a journalist-type person.

37:56.110 --> 37:59.730
She's writing this big book about the tenth anniversary of 9/11.

37:59.830 --> 38:02.160
She's been to a couple of houses,but she wants to talk to you guys.

38:02.260 --> 38:03.300
Of course it has to be a chick.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.120
We seriously gotta talk to this girl,chief?

38:05.220 --> 38:06.180
You don't have to do shit.

38:06.270 --> 38:10.900
Talk to her,don't talk to her-- no skin off my nosE.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.950
Insert the jew joke now,ok?

38:14.980 --> 38:17.340
Well--

38:29.680 --> 38:31.250
Get 'em up there.

38:31.350 --> 38:33.110
Let's go,guys.

38:33.240 --> 38:34.050
Fire department.Anybody here?

38:35.030 --> 38:36.470
Hey,check this one.Hey,guys.

38:36.560 --> 38:37.550
-Yeah?
-Get that room?

38:37.800 --> 38:38.660
You got it.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.300
Hello?

38:54.490 --> 38:57.260
You better hurry it up,lou.We got water issues down here.

38:57.370 --> 38:59.000
Copy that,chief.

39:00.700 --> 39:01.510
What's up,man?

39:01.610 --> 39:03.350
My tank's all screwed up.

39:03.450 --> 39:05.390
I don't know what's the matter.

39:05.940 --> 39:08.220
Garrity!Garrity!

39:08.430 --> 39:09.240
Sean!

39:09.530 --> 39:10.610
Sean,are you all right?

39:10.710 --> 39:12.950
Lou,where you at?We got a problem.

39:15.740 --> 39:17.700
Mayday.62 truck.Man down.

39:17.780 --> 39:19.530
Garrity's down,chief.We gotta get him out of here.

39:19.610 --> 39:21.960
No,no,no,no.You've got to get everyone out.

39:22.070 --> 39:23.080
These hydrants are dry.

39:23.170 --> 39:24.750
We gotta let this building go.

39:24.840 --> 39:25.620
You copy?

39:25.700 --> 39:26.730
All right.We're on our way out.

39:26.850 --> 39:28.010
Double time.
