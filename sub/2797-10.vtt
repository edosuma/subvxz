-Oh, that's adorable.

00:23.208 --> 00:25.875

That looks really hard.

-Knock it off, Cunningham.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.166
-Knock what off?
-You always try to get in my head,

00:34.250 --> 00:36.667

Well, not today.

00:36.750 --> 00:40.667
Not with my signature move:
taunt with offensive gesture,

here at the Gamehole.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.458
Stupid Hole of Fame.

01:17.542 --> 01:20.792
Howard, poor sportsmanship
is not a good color on you.

01:20.875 --> 01:22.583
I call rematch.

01:22.667 --> 01:23.750
What would be the point?

01:23.834 --> 01:25.959
There are no games left
for me to beat you at.

01:26.041 --> 01:29.125
Sounds like you boys
could use yourselves a fresh game.

01:29.208 --> 01:31.875
We just plugged in a brand new title!

01:34.250 --> 01:35.583
Skipow!

01:36.667 --> 01:38.709
You, me, that game, now.

01:38.792 --> 01:41.500
Are you sure, Howard?
I mean, that's a lot of losing in one day.

01:41.583 --> 01:42.542
We're doing this!

01:44.583 --> 01:47.333
Viceroy, I demand
you tell me where we're going.

01:47.417 --> 01:49.792
-I demand it!
-Excuse me for trying

01:49.875 --> 01:53.083

latest plan to destroy the ninja.

01:55.250 --> 01:57.000
Behold!

01:58.500 --> 02:01.250
Jack Hammer.

02:01.333 --> 02:03.125
Why isn't he wearing a shirt?

02:03.208 --> 02:06.834
Jack is the most sophisticated
ninja luring, trapping,

02:06.917 --> 02:09.208
capturing robot I've ever created.

02:09.291 --> 02:12.083
Excellent! Get on with it!
Lure, trap, capture!

02:12.166 --> 02:14.542
One teeny, tiny problemo.

02:14.625 --> 02:16.083
Oh, here it comes.

02:16.166 --> 02:20.083
As it turns out, Jack's engineering
is so brilliantly complex

02:20.166 --> 02:22.208
even I am unable to control it.

02:22.291 --> 02:24.500
You made a robot
no one can control?

02:24.583 --> 02:26.709
I didn't say "No one can control it."

02:26.792 --> 02:29.625
It takes someone
with superior hand-eye coordination,

02:29.709 --> 02:32.542
and an insatiable thirst for destruction.

02:32.625 --> 02:36.375
Qualities only found
in a teenage gamer.

02:36.458 --> 02:39.917
It's got laser mapped, photorealistic,
multi-plane rendering of Norrisville.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.875
You win by destroying
every building in town!

02:42.959 --> 02:45.333
-Oh! I call school!
-Hey, look! Green nachos!

02:45.417 --> 02:47.291
-Huh?
-(laughing)

02:47.375 --> 02:50.208
That's it! You mess with my head,
you jump the queue,

02:50.291 --> 02:53.625
and now you bring nachos
into your trickery?

02:53.709 --> 02:55.500
You sir, have gone too far.

02:55.583 --> 02:57.333
What the juice?

02:57.417 --> 02:59.834
Hey Howard, what should I do
for my next wall pic?

02:59.917 --> 03:01.709
What do you think?
Bed head? Gonna sneeze?

03:01.792 --> 03:02.917
No, no, no. Monkey face.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.250

<i>Let's pound this town!</i>

-Hey Howard, check it out.

03:19.125 --> 03:21.333
Time to take out the trash...

03:21.417 --> 03:22.542
...truck.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.166
Say goodbye to Charlie Clucker's.

03:30.250 --> 03:31.750
You leave the Bucket out of this.

03:33.417 --> 03:34.667
-(gasps)
-Oops.

03:41.375 --> 03:44.667
Cunningham, when I get in there,
oh, I'm going to beat you so bad,

03:44.750 --> 03:46.166
you'll make road kill look cute.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.792
If you get in here.

03:47.875 --> 03:50.125
You should snack up,
I'm going to be awhile.

03:53.041 --> 03:57.500
Oh! It may cost extra
for the wax spray but you're worth it.

03:58.667 --> 04:01.625
Huh? Oh! Come on!

04:02.750 --> 04:04.166
It never fails.

04:04.250 --> 04:05.834
You want a robot to destroy your car?

04:05.917 --> 04:07.291
Go get it washed.

04:07.375 --> 04:09.583
When's this plan gonna start working?

04:09.667 --> 04:11.750
'Cause right now the
only thing getting killed,

04:11.834 --> 04:13.709
is my priceless McFist-A-Wax!

04:13.792 --> 04:18.709
Patience, Hannibal. Jack is pro-destroy,
the Ninja is anti-destroy.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.375
When the Ninja shows up
to stop my robot,

04:21.458 --> 04:25.125
he'll find his ninja sword is no match
for Jack's Hammer.

04:25.208 --> 04:26.792
(giggles)

04:26.875 --> 04:29.333
(chuckles)

04:29.417 --> 04:32.375
(groans) He just destroyed
the McWork-A-Plant...

04:32.458 --> 04:34.667
and the McEat-A-Plant!

04:34.750 --> 04:37.959
And the McFlex-A-Plex!

04:38.041 --> 04:39.959
(game music playing)

04:41.750 --> 04:43.500
Oh god...

04:43.583 --> 04:46.667
Mr. Greg, there's a killer
robot destroying the town!

04:46.750 --> 04:49.250
Permission to cower
in your Gamehole, sir.

04:49.333 --> 04:53.291
Attention Holers, there is a rampaging
robot loose in the city.

04:53.375 --> 04:56.792
For your safety, we ask that you remain
at Greg's Gamehole.

04:56.875 --> 04:58.458
-(gasps)
-While you're trapped here,

04:58.542 --> 05:00.834
why not pay a visit
to Greg's Foodhole?

05:00.917 --> 05:03.000
It's hole-icious! Skipow!

05:03.083 --> 05:05.792
Uh-oh, a rampaging robot.

05:05.875 --> 05:08.667
That sure sounds like
a job for the Ninja!

05:08.750 --> 05:11.834
Howard, even if I quit right now,
you'll still never beat me.

05:11.917 --> 05:15.083
But just in case, I'll do this!

05:18.375 --> 05:21.041
(grunts)

05:23.959 --> 05:27.792
837,000! Good luck beating that, homie!

05:27.875 --> 05:30.792
Oh, you have outshoed yourself,
my arrogant friend...

05:30.875 --> 05:32.709
...And you will pay.

05:32.792 --> 05:36.834
Okay, Jack! Let's earn us
some points.

05:38.041 --> 05:40.000
<i>(Jack) Let's pound this town!</i>

05:45.083 --> 05:47.291
I told you the NInja wouldn't show.

05:47.375 --> 05:49.125
Smoke bomb!

05:49.208 --> 05:52.208
-I told you he would.
-I told you!

05:55.125 --> 05:58.333
Wait a sec, wait a sec.
Jack Hammer's real? What the juice?

05:58.417 --> 06:00.500
Oh, this game has a ninja?

06:00.583 --> 06:03.166
Oh, I am going to
enjoy kicking your butt.

06:03.250 --> 06:06.041
I have to stop Howard.
Call Howard.

06:06.125 --> 06:07.709
<i>(phone) Calling Mom...</i>

06:07.792 --> 06:11.625
No! How does that...
No, call Howard! Howard!

06:11.709 --> 06:13.667

-Hello?

06:13.750 --> 06:16.834
Oh, hey there,
I was just about to punch you.

06:16.917 --> 06:20.166
-Virtually speaking.
- <i>No Howard, you're literally punching me.</i>

06:20.250 --> 06:22.000
<i>Jack Hammer isn't a video game.</i>

06:22.083 --> 06:24.834
He's a real robot and
he's beating up the city.

06:24.917 --> 06:28.083
Oh gosh, I guess I should stop, huh?

06:28.166 --> 06:30.125
Yes, great, thank you.

06:30.208 --> 06:33.625
Are you kidding? You are not getting into
my head with that weak sauce.

06:35.542 --> 06:37.583
I'm only half a mill away from your
high score, buddy,

06:37.667 --> 06:39.625
and there is nothing
you can say to stop me.

06:39.709 --> 06:41.583
Oh, and one other thing?

06:41.667 --> 06:43.917
-Boop.
-What?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.834
-Call Howard!
- <i>(phone) Calling Howard.</i>

06:46.917 --> 06:49.583

06:49.667 --> 06:51.709

06:51.792 --> 06:54.792
All right, Howard. You wanna play?

06:54.875 --> 06:57.834
Let's play. Ninja Chain-Chuku!

06:59.417 --> 07:01.875
(yelling)

07:04.875 --> 07:08.792
That was so Bruce!
I give myself 1000 ninja points!

07:10.875 --> 07:14.500
That's right. I'm going to
lay down my signature move.

07:14.583 --> 07:16.041
First I taunt...

07:17.500 --> 07:20.291
Wow, that was an offensive gesture.

07:20.375 --> 07:22.208
Then I befuddle...

07:22.375 --> 07:24.709
Backflip seemed
a bit unnecessary.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.375
Helicopter kick!

07:26.458 --> 07:29.041
-(yelling)
-(cat yowling)

07:30.917 --> 07:33.166
How'd I miss that?

07:34.250 --> 07:37.166
Well, hey there, blinky light.
What is it that you do?

07:40.959 --> 07:42.875
Uh, what just happened?

07:42.959 --> 07:44.917
(alarm buzzing)

07:45.000 --> 07:47.583

<i>(Jack) Ninja consumed!</i>
<i>Jack Hammer unlocked!</i>

08:00.667 --> 08:02.875
Ninja Glow Balls!

08:02.959 --> 08:04.542
Okay, this is bad.

08:04.625 --> 08:06.041
Really bad.

08:09.917 --> 08:12.667
Okay, NinjaNomicon,
surely I'm not the first ninja to ever

08:12.750 --> 08:14.291
get trapped in a
giant robot stomach.

08:14.375 --> 08:15.709
Could use a little help here.

08:15.792 --> 08:18.208
Actually, a lot of help!

08:19.917 --> 08:21.750
Whoa!

08:26.959 --> 08:29.208
(Randy) "A ninja must know
when winning is losing...

08:29.291 --> 08:30.959

08:31.041 --> 08:34.125
Kind of hoping for something
a little more immediate here.

08:34.208 --> 08:36.875
Like, I don't know,
the exit's through the backdoor.

08:36.959 --> 08:39.959
Oh! A backdoor! I love you Nomicon.

08:42.500 --> 08:45.875

08:58.250 --> 09:00.041
-Did he just...
-I believe he did.

09:00.125 --> 09:02.417
The Ninja's getting away! Get him!

09:18.709 --> 09:20.709
(yells)

09:20.792 --> 09:22.917
Howard, you have to listen to me!

09:23.000 --> 09:24.959
I'm not lying, this is all real!

09:25.041 --> 09:26.750
You have to make the robot stop!

09:26.834 --> 09:29.333
There you go, doing it again.

09:29.417 --> 09:31.291
Trying to get in my head
and make me choke.

09:31.375 --> 09:35.375
Oh Cunningham, desperation is not
a good color on you.

09:37.750 --> 09:39.709

09:39.792 --> 09:40.917

09:41.000 --> 09:46.083
If I want the robot to lose,
I have to let Howard win!

09:46.166 --> 09:49.667
All right, Howard.
You want the high score?

09:49.750 --> 09:51.458
Come and get...

09:54.208 --> 09:57.333
Is that all you got?
Is that it? Ah, gee!

09:57.417 --> 09:59.709
<i>(Howard) I did it.</i>
<i>I beat you, Cunningham!</i>

09:59.792 --> 10:02.166
I did it... I'm so proud of me.

10:02.250 --> 10:04.542
I'm so proud... Cunningham, I did it.

10:04.625 --> 10:07.667
I am so much better than you.

10:07.750 --> 10:09.000
Congrats, buddy.

10:09.083 --> 10:12.000
Now I just need you
to do one more thing.

10:24.125 --> 10:27.917
-(barking)
-(groans) Take me home.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.875
Well, you'd better
get used to seeing my picture.

10:30.959 --> 10:33.333
We destroyed the game,
so it looks like my face

10:33.417 --> 10:35.250
is going to be
up there permanently.

10:35.333 --> 10:36.750
It's too bad your eyes are closed.

10:38.667 --> 10:39.542
(groans)

10:39.625 --> 10:41.709
You know what? Don't care.

10:41.792 --> 10:44.041
All that matters is I beat you hard!

10:44.125 --> 10:47.583
Yes, you did. You sure did.
'Cause I let you.

10:47.667 --> 10:50.125
Oh, it is so on.

10:50.208 --> 10:53.750

11:44.583 --> 11:47.166
We can't go anywhere till we
clean up this mess.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.875
Mop or scraper?

11:48.959 --> 11:50.875
I could mop-slash-scrape

11:50.959 --> 11:54.375
or you could PJ up and
get your ninja-scrub on!

11:54.458 --> 11:57.959
The ninja fights a lot of things,
but stains ain't one of them.

11:58.041 --> 12:00.041
(Slimovitz) <i>Attention, we will be taking</i>

12:00.125 --> 12:02.500
<i>the Spirit Rave</i>
<i>yearbook photo in two minutes.</i>

12:02.583 --> 12:04.542
Fine, Howard, I'll do it.

12:04.625 --> 12:07.625
Oh, come on, you know you...
Wait, you will?

12:07.709 --> 12:10.709
Ya... ru... zo!

12:11.709 --> 12:14.709
(grunts) And done!

12:14.792 --> 12:17.125
-Yeah, you missed a spot.
-(groans)

12:17.208 --> 12:19.250
Mm-hm.

12:21.834 --> 12:24.291
Huh? (grunts)

12:24.375 --> 12:26.458
Time to get serious.

12:26.542 --> 12:28.083
(yelling)

12:31.959 --> 12:34.917
Whew, I thought I broke something.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.583
-Ah, ninja?
-Hm?

12:37.875 --> 12:39.417
Destruction of school property?

12:39.500 --> 12:42.583
Oh, you can't photo bomb
Spirit Day from detention.

12:42.667 --> 12:45.875
-I've run the numbers, it's impossible.
-I'll fix it, I'll fix it.

12:45.959 --> 12:48.208
Little glue, little marker,
Slimovitz will never know.

12:48.291 --> 12:50.417
Just put your finger on it in case
somebody walks in.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.792
-I'll be right back.
-Hurry!

12:52.875 --> 12:55.250
My finger's starting to cramp.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.208
Ow! What the juice?

12:59.959 --> 13:02.083
Yeah, well, that's a blister.

13:02.834 --> 13:05.375
Hm? (yells out)

13:10.375 --> 13:11.542
(farts)

13:12.542 --> 13:13.875
Why did I just do that?

13:13.959 --> 13:15.875
We're in luck! Still got some glue left

13:15.959 --> 13:17.959
from when we patched
that hole to the girls locker room.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.792
(Slimovitz) <i>Everybody</i>
<i>line up for our first</i>

13:19.875 --> 13:22.000
<i>Spirit Day yearbook photo!</i>

13:22.083 --> 13:24.041
Howard, no staring. Patching.

13:24.125 --> 13:26.834
(Slimovitz) <i>Three, two, one.</i>
<i>Lactose-free cheddar!</i>

13:26.917 --> 13:28.834
-(cheering)
<i>-I will treasure that.</i>

13:28.917 --> 13:30.291
Oh, we missed it!

13:34.208 --> 13:36.125
Howard, you got to step it up.

13:36.208 --> 13:39.250
We've only got half the day left to
own that yearbook page.

13:39.333 --> 13:42.667
At the next photo you do nose picker,
I call old-timey boxer.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.917
Hey, why're my hands upside down?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.291
You'll see...

13:49.875 --> 13:52.458
My neck feels a little shnasty.

13:52.542 --> 13:53.709
(groans) Ow.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.667
No, no... this is not happening!

13:57.458 --> 13:59.125
(coughing)

14:00.208 --> 14:04.875
Okay, gang, just because you're smart
doesn't mean you can't show spirit.

14:04.959 --> 14:06.625
Photo time.

14:06.709 --> 14:08.792
Let's get the card catalogue in this one.

14:08.875 --> 14:10.834
(groaning)

14:11.667 --> 14:14.250
Cunningham?
I was just in the bathroom,

14:14.333 --> 14:17.125
and I found something
really weird growing out of my body.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.625
Not weird, that's natural.

14:20.709 --> 14:23.583
The health teacher
said that would happen. Now come on!

14:24.667 --> 14:26.500
Photo! Bomb! Us! Now!

14:26.583 --> 14:29.208
-(squawks)
-No squawking in the library.

14:29.291 --> 14:31.333
Uh, Howard? What was that?

14:31.417 --> 14:34.125
I have no idea. I just... (squawks)

14:34.208 --> 14:38.875
Seriously? I will eject you from
this temple of knowledge.

14:38.959 --> 14:40.208
I have that power.

14:40.291 --> 14:42.542
Sorry. He's sorry.

14:42.625 --> 14:44.750
Howard! He has that power.

14:44.834 --> 14:47.917
I didn't do it on purpose.
I just... (squawks)

14:49.667 --> 14:52.083
Oh, that's positively
teeming with spirit!

14:52.166 --> 14:54.041
That's going straight to the yearbook.

14:54.125 --> 14:56.625
Okay, plan-wise?
That was kind of a bummer.

14:56.709 --> 14:57.959
Where can we improve?

14:58.041 --> 15:00.083
I don't know, I'm thinking
less squawking? Howard?

15:00.166 --> 15:02.917
(clucking)

15:04.125 --> 15:06.166
Cut it out! I'm starting to think

15:06.250 --> 15:08.041
you're not serious
about photo bombing.

15:08.125 --> 15:11.166
(clucks) I... can't... help it!

15:13.083 --> 15:14.417
You'd better help it!

15:14.500 --> 15:18.500
Now, come on, cafeteria!
Spirit Rodeo, let's bomb!

15:19.792 --> 15:22.041
It's Uncle Clive all over again!

15:24.208 --> 15:27.083
(clucking)

15:27.166 --> 15:29.709
Ignore him.
We're not letting Uncle Clive ruin

15:29.792 --> 15:32.125
another Thanksgiving.
Now eat your turkey leg!

15:32.834 --> 15:34.083
(kids cheering)

15:34.166 --> 15:35.583
(clucking)

15:42.166 --> 15:45.583
Stop acting like a bird!

15:45.667 --> 15:48.917
Ow! (clucks)

15:49.000 --> 15:51.250
-Hey Howard.
-(crows)

15:51.333 --> 15:53.375
Ah! I'm Clive-ing out!

15:53.458 --> 15:54.792
(gasps)

15:54.875 --> 15:56.125
(country music plays)

15:56.208 --> 15:58.208
-(yelling)
-Okay, Howard.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.750
When Slimovitz gives the word,

15:59.834 --> 16:02.875
we drop trou, run in
and bomb that photo.

16:02.959 --> 16:04.834
Undies blazin'!

16:04.917 --> 16:06.917
Hm? Now where is he?

16:09.667 --> 16:12.500
Howard! What the juice?

16:12.583 --> 16:16.291
Howdy partners. Mosey on over to the...

16:16.375 --> 16:18.375
Howard!

16:22.458 --> 16:24.500
-(music playing)
-(kids cheering)

16:26.834 --> 16:28.375
What is wrong with you?

16:28.458 --> 16:31.583
There's a bonfire out there just begging
to be photo bombed,

16:31.667 --> 16:33.208
and you got us stuck in detention.

16:33.291 --> 16:34.959
I'm trying to make some memories...

16:35.041 --> 16:36.917
-(clucking)
-(gasps)

16:37.000 --> 16:40.500
...missing the last event of the day
'cause you're being such a wonk?

16:40.583 --> 16:43.208
I don't feel so good.

16:43.291 --> 16:44.709
Yeah, Howard, that's guilt.

16:45.667 --> 16:48.333
Whoa... What's with the eyes?

16:48.417 --> 16:51.667
(squawking)

16:51.750 --> 16:53.917
Whoa! Get back here!

16:54.000 --> 16:56.041
Nobody marches till I say so!

16:56.875 --> 16:58.458
Did you see me wave
my marching stick?

16:59.250 --> 17:01.959
Hm? NinjaNomicon?
Oh, thanks so much for showing up.

17:02.041 --> 17:05.458
Maybe you know why my BFF suddenly turned
into Johnny Squawksalot.

17:06.875 --> 17:09.500
(Randy) <i>Centuries ago,</i>
<i>a great battle was fought</i>

17:09.583 --> 17:13.458
<i>between the Ninja and an evil bird</i>
<i>demon, the Tengu.</i>

17:13.542 --> 17:16.500
<i>The demon was too strong</i>
<i>to defeat until the Ninja</i>

17:16.583 --> 17:20.125
<i>found the source of</i>
<i>the Tengu's great power.</i>

17:20.208 --> 17:25.166
<i>The demon feathers infused the ninja suit</i>
<i>with mysterious power.</i>

17:25.250 --> 17:29.500
<i>Upon defeating the Tengu,</i>
<i>the Ninja imprisoned it in a sacred stone.</i>

17:29.583 --> 17:33.500
<i>It can only be released</i>
<i>by the hand of Ninja!</i>

17:33.583 --> 17:36.333
<i>The Tengu and the Ninja</i>
<i>are forever linked.</i>

17:36.417 --> 17:38.291
<i>Their strengths are shared.</i>

17:40.166 --> 17:42.583
I cracked the stone
and released the Tengu.

17:42.667 --> 17:44.875
I'm the reason Howard got possessed!

17:44.959 --> 17:48.166
But how do I defeat a demon
that's inside my best friend?

17:50.542 --> 17:52.792
-(screaming)
-(crowing)

17:52.875 --> 17:55.208

18:01.750 --> 18:04.625
Serpentine, Herby! Serpentine!

18:08.917 --> 18:11.250
Well, what do you know?
He didn't destroy my car.

18:11.333 --> 18:12.709
Smoke bomb!

18:13.333 --> 18:16.792
Hey! Drop the car, bird thingy...

18:16.875 --> 18:18.709
Ee-yah!

18:18.792 --> 18:22.375
Not cool, bird thingy! Not cool.

18:25.625 --> 18:28.083
Howard, you come down here!

18:31.250 --> 18:32.417
Ninja Kick!

18:32.500 --> 18:35.250
I'm sorry, Howard. Are you okay?

18:36.125 --> 18:37.291
(yelling)

18:41.041 --> 18:42.625
Ninja Dive!

18:42.709 --> 18:44.667
Howard, it's not your fault!

18:44.750 --> 18:47.625
(squawking)

18:47.709 --> 18:49.667
I don't want to fight you,
you're my best friend!

18:50.834 --> 18:52.458
But, you're also a bird demon.

18:52.542 --> 18:54.667
-(squawks)
-So you see my problem, right?

18:54.750 --> 18:56.041
Ninja Scarf Throw!

Let's hope their weaknesses are too.

19:13.041 --> 19:16.250

Ninja Dead Leg! Ow!

19:20.208 --> 19:22.875

19:22.959 --> 19:27.333

as much as it hurts you.

19:50.417 --> 19:52.000
-(groans)
-Not even close, buddy.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.250
Huh?

19:56.333 --> 19:57.709
Howard!

20:03.792 --> 20:07.041
If the suit and Tengu
are linked, I have to...

20:07.125 --> 20:08.500

20:08.583 --> 20:11.583
Uh, I really hope I'm right about this.

20:29.667 --> 20:31.750
(grunts) Oh...

20:31.834 --> 20:34.125
Did you just give up
being the Ninja to save me?

20:34.208 --> 20:35.875
When I broke that
stone in the school,

20:35.959 --> 20:37.875
I might have accidentally released

20:37.959 --> 20:40.875
an ancient bird demon
which possessed you.

20:40.959 --> 20:44.250
So, you're saying this whole thing
was all your fault?

20:44.333 --> 20:46.875
-I guess it was.
-I knew it!

20:46.959 --> 20:48.709
Also, thanks.

Whoa!

Everyone, due to
an unscheduled monster attack,

21:25.250 --> 21:28.583
we were unable to take
the bonfire yearbook photo.
