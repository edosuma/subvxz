You had to keep
it under the radar

find out and follow us.

Orchestrating
a nuclear attack

way to say this, I, uh...

see each other again

11:15.875 --> 11:18.444
their sensors detected
a missile launch but...

11:18.444 --> 11:20.813
there was a US submarine
at those coordinates.

What do you mean?
So we're nuking ourselves?

11:22.749 --> 11:25.018
No! I don't think anyone
is nuking anyone.

I just got off
the phone with the Navy.

11:26.653 --> 11:29.255
They say that all their missiles
are present and accounted for.

11:29.255 --> 11:30.857
This is "War Games."

11:30.857 --> 11:33.893
It's not, I just
told you there's no
incoming missiles, Rich.

No, he's talking
about the movie.

11:35.061 --> 11:36.429
You still haven't
watched "War Games"?

11:36.429 --> 11:38.031
Geez, that movie
literally changed my life.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.933
I mean, Matthew Broderick
made me realize

11:39.933 --> 11:41.234
that I wanted
to be a programmer.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.535
Also his cute dimples
made me realize

11:42.535 --> 11:43.803
a bunch of other stuff.

11:43.803 --> 11:47.073
I was right!
NORAD's been hacked.
What?

11:47.073 --> 11:48.741
Some black hat
used malicious code

11:48.741 --> 11:50.944
to trick their sensors
into detecting
a phony missile.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.413
Then they sent out
a very real emergency alert.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.481
Oh, my God, you guys
shoulda seen your faces

11:55.481 --> 11:56.983

you were gonna die.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.551
This is a massive
cyber attack.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.386
There's still a lot of people
panicking out there.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.422
So, we need to make sure they
know this is a false alarm

12:02.422 --> 12:04.057
and find whoever did this.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.092
I'm sending alerts
to all FBI teams,

12:06.092 --> 12:08.061
NYPD, the DOD,
and the Pentagon.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.363
Okay, I'm gonna
go black hat hunting.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.699
There's some major computing
power behind this

12:12.699 --> 12:15.868
Or a bunch of hackers with
a server farm like Anonymous.

12:15.868 --> 12:17.770
But if it were me,
I would mask my IP address

12:17.770 --> 12:20.840
by routing my activity through
a million proxy servers.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.442
Wait, that's weird.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.244
My search for an IP address
yielded a location and a device.

12:25.244 --> 12:28.314
The hack is coming
from inside the FBI.

12:29.849 --> 12:31.818
So, the closer we get to the
device that's hacking NORAD,

12:31.818 --> 12:34.287
the higher the signal
strength is gonna get.

12:38.157 --> 12:40.760
Do you really think
one of these agents

12:40.760 --> 12:42.295
is hacking NORAD from here?

12:42.295 --> 12:43.630
No, we are not
looking for a person.

their activity through here.

This did not ping
because of a server.

know Remi's involved.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.166
Franco won't be
happy to see us.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.701
I'm counting on it.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.337
If you're getting cold feet,
I can handle it.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.572
And leave right when
the fun's about to start?

19:33.572 --> 19:35.508
Not a chance.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.683
Forgive us
for the ambush,

19:43.683 --> 19:45.518
but you're not
an easy man to track down.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.421
English is fine.

19:48.421 --> 19:51.891
I'm Madeline Burke.
CEO of HCI Global.

19:51.891 --> 19:55.628
And I have a business
proposal for you.

19:55.628 --> 19:58.431
If you play your cards right,
you could earn hundreds
of millions of dollars.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.933
All we want to do is talk.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.437
Okay.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.604
Make your sales pitch.

20:05.604 --> 20:08.607
If I don't like it,
you're both dead.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.277
We all gotta go sometime.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.412
♪♪

20:17.383 --> 20:20.553
So, what's
the big proposal?

20:20.553 --> 20:23.722
We know a lot about you
and your business.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.492
You've been
tremendously successful
in the last few months

20:26.492 --> 20:29.428
due in large part to an employee
of yours: a Del Toro.

20:29.428 --> 20:32.731
Del Toro has hacked
into the DEA, ATF,

20:32.731 --> 20:35.868
and all South American
law enforcement for you.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.604
We also know that you're
hemorrhaging money

20:38.604 --> 20:41.006
from a turf war
with the Rivera Cartel.

20:41.006 --> 20:42.374
Now I could help fix that.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.410
How are you
going to do that?

20:44.410 --> 20:45.778
I will tell you in detail.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.346
But I have to first
ask that these men

20:47.346 --> 20:48.681
stop pointing
their guns at us

20:48.681 --> 20:50.950
so we can have
a civilized conversation.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.091
Drink it up.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.494
It might be
your last.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.431
Do I look worried?

21:10.569 --> 21:12.771
So, uh, we're almost
out of the city.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.440
Uh, where to now?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.509
Tompkins Road
in Westchester.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.177
Mile marker 11.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.446
That's our final
destination.

21:20.446 --> 21:23.149
How final? Like--
like final resting place?

21:23.149 --> 21:27.286
'Cause this end point
is in the middle of nowhere.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.088
You know, uh...

21:29.088 --> 21:31.891
despite being coerced
at gunpoint to, uh, commit

21:31.891 --> 21:34.793
about a dozen major
felonies today, I, uh...

21:34.793 --> 21:38.264
You know, I gotta say I'm--
I'm having the time of my life.

21:38.264 --> 21:41.467
Yeah, I-I've never
felt more alive, heh.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.935
Your point is?

21:42.935 --> 21:45.404
Well, I mean,
after this mission ends,

21:45.404 --> 21:47.506
you're gonna be
on the run, right?

21:47.506 --> 21:50.509
Could be kinda helpful
to have an expert hacker

21:50.509 --> 21:52.945
and forger along,
don't you think?

21:59.485 --> 22:02.321
Something Weller
said to me, I...

22:02.321 --> 22:04.023
I can't stop
thinking about it.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.325
His words keep
pounding in my head.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.527
You hate me
because I remind you

22:08.527 --> 22:10.429
of what a failure you are.

22:10.429 --> 22:13.432
I've blamed him for everything
that's happened

22:13.432 --> 22:15.000
since I crawled
out of that bag.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.237
But the truth is,
this is all my fault.

22:18.237 --> 22:23.175
When it mattered most,
I was weak, and I failed.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.010
Then make today
your redemption.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.112
Your chance
to make it right.

22:27.112 --> 22:29.481
And then what?

22:29.481 --> 22:31.150
I'm still dying.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.551
Shepherd will have a plan.

22:32.551 --> 22:34.753
She'll know exactly
what to do.

22:38.691 --> 22:39.758
We know you're
being trampled

22:39.758 --> 22:41.527
by the Rivera Cartel
in Bartoba.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.462
They're poaching your
product and your mules.

22:43.462 --> 22:45.164
I can help remedy that.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.365
How?

22:46.365 --> 22:47.766
Money buys a lot.

22:47.766 --> 22:50.069
Power, influence,
politicians.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.237
But you
already know that.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.305
The mayor of this city
is on your payroll.

22:53.305 --> 22:56.141
Ah, the mayor
is easy to buy off.

22:56.141 --> 22:59.878
The Rivera Cartel is run
by the President of Bartoba.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.781
But if the president
were eliminated,

23:02.781 --> 23:05.217
that would create a power vacuum
that had to be filled.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.952
By an ally, perhaps.

23:06.952 --> 23:09.388
It's a wonderful fairytale.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.557
I don't like
people wasting my time.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.392
We're done.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.094
No, please,
check your phone.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.830
There might be some
interesting breaking news.

23:25.471 --> 23:28.374
How does a nuke alert
help me?

23:28.374 --> 23:30.442
Scroll down.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.117
You tried to kill
the President of Bartoba?

23:38.117 --> 23:40.119
I made sure he survived.

23:40.119 --> 23:41.186
It was proof of concept.

23:41.186 --> 23:42.554
The next time will
be the kill shot.

23:42.554 --> 23:44.456
What were you saying
about fairytales?

23:46.792 --> 23:48.560
You're crazy, you know?

23:50.129 --> 23:51.664
I love it.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.433
I had a feeling you would.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.735
What do you need from me?

23:56.735 --> 23:58.937
We want to borrow
your hacker, Del Toro.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.407
Simple job,
one or two days, tops.

24:01.407 --> 24:02.775
Not happening.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.376
We know how valuable
he is to you.

24:04.376 --> 24:07.313
How about a down payment?
Show of good faith.

24:07.313 --> 24:09.014
Fine.

24:09.014 --> 24:13.252
One of my employees

24:13.252 --> 24:15.054
When you are
done with Del Toro,

24:15.054 --> 24:17.556
you can have her back.

24:20.025 --> 24:22.795
How about $2 million
upfront instead?

24:22.795 --> 24:24.730
When Del Toro finishes,
you get him back,

24:24.730 --> 24:26.832

your Bartoba problems.

24:44.183 --> 24:45.117
Okay.

24:54.793 --> 24:56.562
Well...

24:56.562 --> 24:58.664
Now, that's inconvenient.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.599
It's a plane ride away.

25:00.599 --> 25:03.469

afford the ticket.

25:03.469 --> 25:05.404

this threat seriously.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.345

me for the warning

25:46.345 --> 25:48.680

for this type of situation.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.149
Yeah, but their protocols
are the problem.

They don't know
what's about to hit them.

need him for something.

You're still our best bet

How are you
communicating
with her?

31:30.589 --> 31:31.490
Phone?
No.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.558
Uh, encrypted
email messages.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.360
That's not exactly helpful.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.296
Okay... well,
how 'bout this?

31:38.296 --> 31:41.933
Uh, Jane's talking
to her dead brother.

31:43.168 --> 31:46.304
Roman?
What are you
talking about?

31:46.304 --> 31:47.873
I don't know where,
she just started staying

31:47.873 --> 31:50.609
this strange
personal stuff, like...

31:50.609 --> 31:52.544
that she's dying.

31:52.544 --> 31:55.514
And, uh, and then at
the crash site, I overheard her

31:55.514 --> 31:58.016
tell Shepherd
that Roman was there.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.887
She's hallucinating.

32:01.887 --> 32:03.955
Just like Roman was.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.359
Her ZIP poisoning's
getting worse.

32:10.996 --> 32:12.230
We can't stay here
for very long.

32:12.230 --> 32:15.000
We need to keep moving.
And go where?

32:15.901 --> 32:17.936
All our resources...

32:17.936 --> 32:20.138
all our people...

32:20.138 --> 32:21.273
Gone.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.141
So we'll rebuild.

32:25.477 --> 32:27.813
Maybe we should
just disappear.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.981
Somewhere where
they can't find us.

32:29.981 --> 32:32.417
Somewhere we can
live in peace.

32:32.417 --> 32:34.452
Peace?

32:34.452 --> 32:36.188
Are you serious?

32:37.823 --> 32:39.691
I have sacrificed everything,

32:39.691 --> 32:42.327

No, I don't need you
to get reflective.

I need you to get angry.

32:49.935 --> 32:52.103

imprisoning you.

32:52.103 --> 32:54.139
At the CIA
for torturing you.

33:23.768 --> 33:25.570
That person is gone, too.

I'm so sorry, Remi.

33:36.314 --> 33:38.516
I don't need you
to be sorry.

I need you to stand up

the FBI and NORAD

I was working for the FBI?

to tell them that
Jane is Remi, and that's...

37:03.054 --> 37:06.624

charging you with anything

'cause if they do,
they'll be admitting that their

incredibly "unhackable" system
is totally compromised, so...

is the only reason I called you

38:58.570 --> 39:02.006

that I loved you, so...

39:02.006 --> 39:04.075

Oh, no, no, no, no--

39:38.776 --> 39:41.379

39:41.379 --> 39:43.581

they used as a getaway

Remi and Shepherd
have disappeared.

39:47.318 --> 39:50.588
Patterson, how's that
procedure that you found
for Jane coming along?

39:50.588 --> 39:52.957
I talked to my
neurobiologist friend,

39:52.957 --> 39:55.727

everything we need

39:55.727 --> 39:57.262

"willing patient" works.

40:08.006 --> 40:11.209
If that's the only way
that we can get back my wife,
we have to try.

40:11.209 --> 40:14.612

a cure for Jane's ZIP poisoning.

serious risks here.

Jane's memories or...

a 1% chance
