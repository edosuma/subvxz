WEBVTT

04:03.368 --> 04:05.744
I've come back.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.168
Give me a drink, brother Kipling.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.469
Don't you know me?

04:22.845 --> 04:24.554
No.

04:25.014 --> 04:26.974
I don't know you.

04:28.142 --> 04:29.893
Who are you?

04:31.187 --> 04:32.854
What can I do for you?

04:33.022 --> 04:36.858
I told you, give me a drink.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.268
It was all settled…

05:11.519 --> 05:15.105
…right here in this office.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.400
Remember?

05:18.818 --> 05:22.237
Danny and me signed the contract…

05:22.405 --> 05:24.573
…and you witnessed it.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.283
You…

05:28.453 --> 05:30.579
…stood over there.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.666
I stood there.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.753
And Daniel stood here.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.548
Remember?

05:43.468 --> 05:44.801
Carnehan.

05:47.430 --> 05:51.767
Peachy Taliaferro Carnehan.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.602
Of course.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.062
Keep looking at me.

05:56.105 --> 05:59.274
It helps to keep my soul from flying off.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.068
Carnehan.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.277
The same…

06:02.570 --> 06:06.948
…and not the same who sat beside you
in the first-class carriage…

06:07.116 --> 06:09.159
…on the train to Marwar Junction…

06:09.327 --> 06:11.411
…three summers
and a thousand years ago.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.800
Jodhpur, please.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.156
Blast.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.258
May I?

08:30.676 --> 08:32.260
Riding in this bloody ash cart…

08:32.428 --> 08:36.389
…is like getting kicked in the rear
by a battery mule every ten minutes.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.333
Mr. Clutterbury Das…

09:03.501 --> 09:08.338
…failed entrance examination,
Calcutta University, 1863.

09:08.506 --> 09:12.384
Writer of correspondence
for the illiterate general public.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.969
Shut up.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.137
Thank you, sir.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.648
Out the window, babu.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.609
Thank you, sir.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.571
Outside, you inky-fingered thief.

10:14.739 --> 10:18.199
- And I hope you break your dirty neck.
- Thank you, sir.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.577
Good God, man,
you might have killed the chap.

10:20.745 --> 10:21.870
Serves him right if I had.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.623
But we're not making
five miles an hour on this grade.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.625
But why?

10:28.127 --> 10:30.545
I caught him stealing your watch.

10:31.213 --> 10:32.964
My watch?

10:33.883 --> 10:36.468
I say, it is my watch.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.554
Well.

10:41.098 --> 10:44.976
I'm very much obliged to you, Mr…?

10:45.144 --> 10:49.356
Carnehan. Former gunnery sergeant
in Her Majesty's Forces.

10:49.523 --> 10:50.940
Mine's Kipling.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.736
- May I offer you a drink?
- I don't mind if I do.

11:00.868 --> 11:03.453
You've knocked about India a bit,
I take it?

11:03.913 --> 11:08.416
You can say that twice.
On foot, on horseback and on camel.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.710
But you don't look
too green yourself, either.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.253
No, I was born in India.

11:12.421 --> 11:17.175
Great country, or was till the bureaucrats
took over and ruined everything.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.011
- I hope you're not one of them.
- No, I'm not a bureaucrat.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.262
No, I didn't think so.

11:21.430 --> 11:25.266
They're usually narrow-chested chaps
with long noses for looking down at you…

11:25.434 --> 11:28.103
…and I've yet to have one of them
offer me a drink.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.690
Glenlivet, 12 years old.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.775
You've an educated taste in whiskey.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.027
I've an educated taste
in whiskey and women…

11:36.195 --> 11:38.154
…waistcoats and bills of fare…

11:38.322 --> 11:41.032
…but I've had few chances
to exercise it lately.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.369
Because them that governs spend
all their time making up new laws…

11:44.537 --> 11:47.080
…to stop men like you and me
from getting anywhere.

11:47.248 --> 11:50.208
And who's loss is it?
Why England's, of course.

11:50.376 --> 11:53.420
If such as we were given our heads,
it wouldn't be 70 millions…

11:53.587 --> 11:56.756
…she'd be making in revenues,
it'd be 700 millions. Right?

11:56.924 --> 11:59.175
Yes, I quite agree. Yes.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.012
- Where are you heading for?
- Jodhpur.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.223
Will you be travelling back
along this line?

12:05.391 --> 12:07.642
- In about ten days time.
- Could you make it eight?

12:07.810 --> 12:10.937
I must get a message to a man who'll
be travelling through Marwar Junction…

12:11.105 --> 12:13.648
…on the Bombay Mail
on the night of the 24th.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.650
He expects me to meet him, but I can't.

12:15.818 --> 12:19.821
- I've got urgent business in the south.
- I'm sorry, I can't help you there.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.407
Supposing I was to ask you…

12:22.575 --> 12:24.659
…as a stranger going to the west…

12:24.827 --> 12:27.203
…to seek for that which was lost.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.664
What would you say then?

12:29.874 --> 12:32.208
I should answer,
"Where do you come from?"

12:32.835 --> 12:36.004
From the east, and I am hoping
that you will give my message…

12:36.172 --> 12:40.550
…on the square for the sake
of the widow's son.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.802
Which lodge do you hail from?

12:43.387 --> 12:46.222
Travelling Lodge 3276,
the Fore and Fit.

12:46.474 --> 12:51.186
The Queen's Own Royal Loyal
Light Infantry, Regimental District 329A.

12:51.687 --> 12:54.189
- To whom shall I deliver the message?
- Daniel Dravot.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.523
- Dravot?
- Yes.

12:55.691 --> 12:59.027
A big man with long gray sideboards.
A great swell he is.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.530
You'll find him surrounded by
his luggage in a first-class compartment.

13:02.698 --> 13:06.618
But don't you be afraid,
just slip the window down and say:

13:06.827 --> 13:08.953
"Peachy's gone south for the week."

13:09.121 --> 13:10.747
Peachy's gone south for the week.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.333
Yes, and he'll tumble.

13:13.501 --> 13:18.254
Well, I'll be getting off now
before we reach the station.

13:21.383 --> 13:24.052
By the way, brother Carnehan…

13:25.012 --> 13:28.473
…I missed my watch
in the station at Lahore…

13:28.641 --> 13:31.226
…before boarding the train.

13:31.393 --> 13:34.437
How was I to know you were a Mason?

13:59.755 --> 14:01.005
Oh!

14:01.173 --> 14:03.049
What's this?

14:03.217 --> 14:05.885
God's holy trousers, tickets again?

14:06.053 --> 14:08.471
Is your name Dravot, sir?

14:10.057 --> 14:11.099
Hm?

14:11.559 --> 14:15.687
I'm to say that Peachy
has gone south for the week.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.446
He's gone south for the week.

14:25.614 --> 14:29.284
Did he say I was to give you anything
for telling me this? Because I won't.

14:29.451 --> 14:31.911
- No, he didn't.
- Then why did you do it?

14:32.079 --> 14:33.788
For the sake of the widow's son.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.083
- Oh.
- Heh, heh, heh.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.420
- He said south, did he?
- Yes.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.964
Then that'll be Degumber.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.050
Since you're a pal of Peachy's,
I don't mind telling you.

14:46.218 --> 14:50.096
We're going to put the screw on the rajah
for what he did to his mother-in-law.

14:50.264 --> 14:53.808
Filled her with red peppers, hung her
over a beam and flogged her to death.

14:55.519 --> 14:58.646
You mean to say that you intend
to blackmail him?

14:58.814 --> 15:01.149
Man, you wouldn't get out
of Degumber alive.

15:01.317 --> 15:04.152
If they don't cut your throats,
they'll certainly poison you.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.655
Both's been tried more than once,
but Peachy and me, we don't kill easy.

15:07.823 --> 15:11.492
But the rajah's an independent ruler,
he answers to nobody. Ha, ha, ha.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.828
How do you hope to put
the screw on him?

15:14.038 --> 15:18.416
By telling him we're correspondents
for The Northern Star.

15:18.584 --> 15:22.378
You can't. You can't do that.
You can't do that.

15:22.546 --> 15:27.133
Because I am the correspondent
of The Northern Star!

15:27.301 --> 15:28.343
You what?

15:28.510 --> 15:31.679
I'm the correspondent
of The Northern Star!

15:31.847 --> 15:35.224
Eh? What did you say, brother?

15:41.106 --> 15:44.651
As you know, Kipling,
we took them at the Degumber Border…

15:44.818 --> 15:47.904
…so there's a question
of jurisdiction involved.

15:48.072 --> 15:51.658
But a charge of conspiracy to blackmail
might be brought.

15:51.825 --> 15:56.371
I didn't lay this information
before you as a criminal prosecution, sir…

15:56.538 --> 15:58.915
…only to save their lives.

15:59.083 --> 16:02.835
Then may I ask what particular interest
you have in these scoundrels?

16:03.796 --> 16:07.256
Well, they… They happen to be…

16:07.424 --> 16:09.884
…Freemasons, like myself.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.427
Freemasons?

16:11.595 --> 16:14.180
Those chaps? I should think
you'd strike them off your roll.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.808
Once a Mason, always a Mason.

16:16.976 --> 16:21.104
Never could understand
how perfectly pukka chaps, like yourself…

16:21.271 --> 16:24.232
…can go about on public occasions
wearing aprons and sashes…

16:24.400 --> 16:27.193
…shaking hands with total strangers.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.237
Just what is Masonry, Kipling?

16:29.405 --> 16:33.199
It's an ancient order
dedicated to the brotherhood of man…

16:33.367 --> 16:35.910
…under the all-seeing eye of God.

16:36.078 --> 16:39.706
We should've done well to have left
that sort of thing behind us in England.

16:39.873 --> 16:40.915
It can never work here.

16:41.083 --> 16:44.711
There are tales that it did work here
before we ever came.

16:44.878 --> 16:49.298
Some audacious scholars can even trace it
back to the builders of Solomon's Temple.

16:49.466 --> 16:53.428
Hm. Old wives' tales, I suspect.

16:53.595 --> 16:56.889
Yes, in all likelihood, sir.

16:57.057 --> 17:02.437
Well, let's have a look
at your lodge brothers.

17:07.192 --> 17:10.194
Right turn.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.450
Halt.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.868
Hats off.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.580
You men are not under arrest…

17:21.749 --> 17:25.460
…thanks to Mr. Kipling here, who happens
to be a genuine correspondent…

17:25.627 --> 17:27.170
…for The Northern Star.

17:27.337 --> 17:31.424
But both of you richly deserve
to be in jail.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.218
I have your records before me.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.179
There's everything in them…

17:36.346 --> 17:39.599
…from smuggling to swindling
to receiving stolen goods…

17:39.767 --> 17:41.601
…to bare-faced blackmail.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.770
Sir, I resent the accusation of blackmail.

17:43.937 --> 17:47.857
It is blackmail to obtain money by threats
of publishing information in a newspaper.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.818
But what blackmail is there
in accepting a small retainer…

17:50.986 --> 17:52.695
…for keeping it out of a newspaper?

17:52.863 --> 17:54.697
And how did you propose to keep it out?

17:54.865 --> 17:57.575
By telling the editor
what I know about his sister…

17:57.743 --> 18:01.579
…and a certain government official
in these parts.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.208
Let him put that in his paper
if he has need of news.

18:09.797 --> 18:13.382
It would have been wiser if you had
gone home at the end of your army service.

18:13.550 --> 18:14.634
Home to what?

18:14.802 --> 18:18.638
A porter's uniform outside a restaurant and
tanner tips from belching civilians…

18:18.806 --> 18:21.224
…for closing doors
on them and their blowzy women?

18:21.391 --> 18:24.352
Not after watching Afghans
come howling down out of the hills…

18:24.520 --> 18:27.313
…and taking battlefield command
when the officers had copped it.

18:27.481 --> 18:28.689
Well said, brother Dravot.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.192
There may be no criminal charges
against you…

18:31.360 --> 18:34.195
…but I'll see these
files reach Calcutta…

18:34.363 --> 18:37.907
…with the recommendation that
you be deported as political undesirables.

18:38.075 --> 18:41.285
Detriments to the dignity of the Empire
and the izzat of the Raj.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.122
Detriments you call us? Detriments?

18:44.289 --> 18:46.541
I want to remind you
it was detriments like us…

18:46.708 --> 18:49.919
…that built this bloody Empire
and the izzat of the bloody Raj.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.046
Hats on.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.382
About turn.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.718
By the left, quick march.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.679
Left…

19:00.180 --> 19:02.056
…turn.

19:06.061 --> 19:09.272
There's no need to let any of this
get into the Star…

19:09.439 --> 19:11.858
- …I take it, Kipling?
- Huh?

19:12.067 --> 19:13.734
No, no.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.075
Copy.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.108
My God. You two.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.526
What do you want this time?

19:55.694 --> 19:58.154
We want to ask you a favor.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.530
Another favor?

19:59.698 --> 20:01.449
Calm yourself, brother Kipling…

20:01.617 --> 20:04.202
…we've never taken advantage
of a fellow in the craft.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.621
We don't want money,
just a little of your time…

20:06.788 --> 20:10.166
…a look at a book or two,
study of your maps.

20:10.334 --> 20:14.045
We'll take a drink if one's being offered,
but we won't be put out if one isn't.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.172
Peachy here is as sober as I am.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.383
It's important you have no doubts
on that score.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.929
So we'll take one of your cigars apiece…

20:23.222 --> 20:27.141
…and you shall watch us light up.

20:37.819 --> 20:44.033
And now, sir, let me introduce you
to brother Peachy Carnehan, which is him.

20:44.201 --> 20:49.080
And brother Daniel Dravot, which is I.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.666
The less said about our professions,
the better…

20:51.833 --> 20:53.834
…for we have been
most things in our time.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.336
We've been all over India…

20:55.504 --> 20:59.090
…we know her cities, her jungles,
her jails and her passes…

20:59.258 --> 21:02.843
…and we have decided that
she isn't big enough for such as we.

21:03.011 --> 21:05.263
That's what I understood
the commissioner to say.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.723
Therefore, we are going away
to another place…

21:07.891 --> 21:10.810
…where a man isn't crowded
and can come into his own.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.353
We're not little men.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.022
So we're going away to be kings.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.358
Kings of Kafiristan.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.193
Oh. Kafiristan?

21:19.361 --> 21:21.362
We hear they have
two and 30 idols there.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.031
So we'll be the 33rd and 34th.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.201
It's a place of warring tribes,
which is to say…

21:27.369 --> 21:29.704
…a land of opportunity for such as we…

21:29.871 --> 21:32.415
…who know how to train men
and lead them into battle.

21:32.582 --> 21:35.418
We'll go there.
We'll say to any chief we can find:

21:35.585 --> 21:37.586
"Do you want to vanquish your foes?"

21:37.754 --> 21:39.755
"Of course," he'll say, "go to it."

21:40.299 --> 21:44.051
We'll fight for him, make him king,
then we'll subvert that king.

21:44.219 --> 21:48.055
We'll seize his royal throne and loot
the country four ways from Sunday.

21:48.223 --> 21:50.224
How's that for a plan?

21:51.143 --> 21:53.519
Heh. You're both out of your minds.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.566
To start with…

21:59.776 --> 22:04.697
…the only way to get there
is through Afghanistan. Hmm. Hm!

22:05.449 --> 22:08.284
Kafiristan? Heh, heh, heh.
No, no, no.

22:08.452 --> 22:11.329
Two white men on their own
would be cut to pieces…

22:11.496 --> 22:14.415
…before they were five miles
into the Khyber Pass.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.625
Just suppose we managed it.

22:16.793 --> 22:21.589
Just suppose, and suppose we got
across the Afghan plains, then what?

22:21.757 --> 22:23.716
There's the Hindu Kush…

22:23.884 --> 22:27.970
…a frozen sea of peaks and glaciers.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.598
A party of geographers,
a mapping expedition…

22:30.766 --> 22:33.267
…tried several years ago
and vanished into thin air.

22:33.435 --> 22:37.980
No white man has ever been there
and come out since Alexander.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.231
Alexander who?

22:40.108 --> 22:42.109
Alexander the Great, King of Greece…

22:42.277 --> 22:44.195
…about 300 years before Christ.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.947
Well, if a Greek can do it, we can do it.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.116
Right.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.788
I can only repeat,
you're a pair of lunatics.

22:54.289 --> 22:58.667
Would a pair of lunatics draw up
a contract like this?

23:00.545 --> 23:02.254
"This contract between me and you…

23:02.422 --> 23:05.508
…pursuing witnesseth here
in the name of God, Amen, and so forth.

23:05.675 --> 23:08.260
One: That you and me will settle
this matter together…

23:08.428 --> 23:10.763
…i.e., to be Kings of Kafiristan.

23:10.931 --> 23:14.141
Two: That you and me will not,
while this matter is being settled…

23:14.309 --> 23:17.311
…look at any liquor nor any woman,
black, white or brown…

23:17.479 --> 23:20.022
…so as to get mixed up
with one or the other harmful.

23:20.190 --> 23:23.109
Three: That we conduct ourselves
with dignity and discretion…

23:23.276 --> 23:26.487
…and if one of us gets into trouble,
the other one will stay by him.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.155
Signed by you and me this day."

23:28.323 --> 23:31.325
There's no need for the last article,
but it's got a ring to it.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.618
Ah.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.829
Daniel?

24:07.529 --> 24:10.823
Now, you witness it and it's legal.

24:26.882 --> 24:30.885
Well, gentlemen, it's 4 in the morning.

24:31.052 --> 24:33.512
Don't you stand on politeness,
brother Kipling.

24:33.680 --> 24:36.223
If you want to go to bed,
we won't steal anything.

24:36.391 --> 24:38.476
Well, thank you.

24:38.643 --> 24:41.145
We'll send word
when we're ready to push off…

24:41.313 --> 24:43.689
…in case you want to bid us
a fond goodbye.

24:43.857 --> 24:47.610
Yes, well,
try not to burn the place down.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.908
Here we are.

24:54.910 --> 24:59.705
"Kafiristan, 10,000 square miles,
mountainous terrain…

24:59.873 --> 25:02.750
…religion unknown,
population unknown.

25:03.043 --> 25:06.921
Conquered by Alexander in 328 B.C.

25:07.088 --> 25:09.340
According to Herioditus…

25:09.508 --> 25:12.927
…he defeated King Ox Y-Artes…

25:13.094 --> 25:19.099
…whose daughter Roxanne
he subsequently took to wife."

25:20.435 --> 25:22.937
Buy for your wife, sir?

25:25.148 --> 25:27.024
Hee-yah!

25:28.276 --> 25:31.070
If you buy from me, sir,
I make you very good price, sir.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.989
Very cheap, very nice thing for you.
Specially for you, sir.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.036
Ah, ah, ah!

25:45.418 --> 25:47.419
Hee-yah, hee-yah, hee-yah.

25:53.552 --> 25:58.389
Our forward continuance is impeded by this
fellow, sir, who is begging the sahib…

25:58.557 --> 26:02.059
…that you will accompany with him
that he may show to you a rare…

26:02.227 --> 26:04.311
- …and wonderful thing.
- Thing? What thing?

26:04.479 --> 26:06.897
Indeed, the man would not say
what thing.

26:07.065 --> 26:11.151
Therefore, sahib, sir,
I suspect his bad intentions…

26:11.319 --> 26:15.447
…to entice the sahib into
a naughty house of disreputation…

26:15.615 --> 26:18.284
…where he will take you
and kill you and murder you…

26:18.451 --> 26:21.829
…and cut your throat and rob the money
from your pockets also.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.582
Crikey, wait for me at the office.

26:24.749 --> 26:29.503
But, sir, please. Sahib, myself, I will take
you to a loving house. More better.

26:29.671 --> 26:32.548
You will be very happy and delightful.

26:58.241 --> 27:00.117
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

27:00.952 --> 27:02.661
Morning to you, brother.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.706
Glad you stopped by
and caught the matinée performance.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.208
- What'd you think of it?
- It's convincing enough…

27:08.376 --> 27:10.794
…but what the devil
are you two rascals up to now?

27:10.962 --> 27:14.506
Last week it was kings you were to be,
of Kafiristan, as I remember.

27:14.674 --> 27:16.508
Right, but we've gotta get there first.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.844
Madness is a trick.

27:19.220 --> 27:22.222
Who'd hurt some poor crazy priest
and his servant, hm?

27:22.390 --> 27:25.934
Peachy worked out this dodge. We've used
it before. He's good with the lingo.

27:26.102 --> 27:28.395
He does the talking
while I act dumb and balmy.

27:28.563 --> 27:30.689
I've got so I can do
the clowning pretty good.

27:30.857 --> 27:33.901
I can twitch so as to put the fear of Allah
into any good Muslim.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.570
I can froth at the mouth
something horrid. Want to see?

27:36.988 --> 27:38.072
Well, I can imagine.

27:38.239 --> 27:40.491
All right, then.
Some other time, perhaps.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.743
Come over here.

27:47.540 --> 27:50.417
Give it a touch up down here.

27:53.421 --> 27:57.007
- Rifles?
- Martinis, 20 of them and ammunition.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.552
Cost us every sou we squeezed
out of the Raj of Degumber.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.596
Good heavens.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.933
- You mean, you went back there?
- Of course, brother Kipling.

28:06.142 --> 28:08.936
Heaven help you
if you're caught with those at the border.

28:09.104 --> 28:12.439
Gun-running isn't exactly new to us.

28:12.607 --> 28:16.485
Well, brother Kipling,
goodbye and many thanks.

28:16.653 --> 28:19.697
Man, don't do it.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.949
The odds are too great.

28:22.117 --> 28:25.911
Wish us luck. We met upon the level.

28:26.121 --> 28:27.788
And we're parting on the square.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.418
Good luck indeed.

28:38.466 --> 28:41.218
Come along, you ugly beast.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.475
Wait.

28:51.688 --> 28:54.982
Here, take this.

29:16.296 --> 29:19.715
Last time Danny and me came
through the Khyber Pass…

29:19.883 --> 29:23.969
…we fought our way,
yard by bloody yard.

29:24.137 --> 29:27.598
And General Bobbs
called us heroes afterwards.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.475
But that was years ago…

29:29.642 --> 29:31.018
…and times have changed.

29:31.186 --> 29:34.229
Blast. Look who's on sentry.

29:34.689 --> 29:35.731
Mulvaney.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.734
That loud-mouthed Mick
from the Black Tyrone.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.694
Private Mulvaney.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.864
Come to attention
when I am addressing you.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.074
Slope arms.

29:47.577 --> 29:50.454
Present arms.

29:52.248 --> 29:53.832
Mark time.

29:54.709 --> 29:57.127
At the double.

30:03.009 --> 30:05.093
Corporal of the Guard.

30:06.596 --> 30:09.848
Take three men and put Private Mulvaney
under close arrest.

30:10.016 --> 30:12.392
Bloody man's drunk again.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.729
We came through the Khyber
with that caravan…

30:16.064 --> 30:19.274
…doing all sorts of antics
to amuse the people.

30:19.901 --> 30:24.446
At night he told them their fortunes
in a tongue of his own devising…

30:24.614 --> 30:26.281
…and I translated.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.158
And all concerned were happy…

30:28.326 --> 30:32.955
…because I promised them
that all their wishes would come true.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.170
Oh!

30:45.635 --> 30:47.803
Then at Jaedallak…

30:47.971 --> 30:50.472
…we turned off towards Kafiristan.

30:51.432 --> 30:55.936
They were sad to see us leave the caravan.
We'd brought it good luck.

30:56.104 --> 31:00.816
Two she-camels had been foaled and
there was no sniping at us from the hills.

31:03.444 --> 31:06.655
They waved goodbye
to the mad priest and his servant.

31:07.115 --> 31:10.659
And Danny danced them out of sight.

31:22.380 --> 31:27.301
The country was deserty,
the inhabitants was dispersed and solitary.

31:27.468 --> 31:30.304
We traveled by night
and kept away from villages…

31:30.471 --> 31:34.683
…as we didn't want to waste ammunition
in idle fighting with Afghans.

32:21.105 --> 32:23.273
The Pushtukan.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.985
A little wavy blue line on the map…

32:27.528 --> 32:30.030
…but we couldn't hope
to get the camels across.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.867
So Peachy says to Danny,
"It doesn't matter what they cost us…

32:34.035 --> 32:37.329
…in the Lahore Bazaar.
We'll trade them for goats."

32:37.497 --> 32:39.706
We're playing for very high stakes.

32:39.874 --> 32:41.875
Pipe Major McCrimmon bet me
ten bob once…

32:42.043 --> 32:45.003
…he could blow up
a whole goatskin with one breath…

32:45.171 --> 32:46.338
…and he did.

32:46.506 --> 32:49.800
Though he'd sat down on an anthill
in his kilt unknowing-like.

32:49.968 --> 32:53.053
Ten shillings. It was ten shillings
to Pipe Major McCrimmon.

33:24.502 --> 33:26.336
Mules.

33:28.381 --> 33:29.631
Now…

33:30.216 --> 33:31.425
…the problem is…

33:32.343 --> 33:36.680
…how to divide five Afghans
from three mules…

33:36.848 --> 33:38.765
…and have two Englishmen left over.

33:38.933 --> 33:40.308
Shoot them out their saddles.

33:40.476 --> 33:43.854
No, the mules would bolt.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.444
Sit over there, Danny.

36:14.255 --> 36:18.884
So we starts forward,
into those bitter cold mountainous parts…

36:19.051 --> 36:22.721
…and never a path broader
than the back of your hand.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.232
The mountains was tall and white…

36:34.775 --> 36:36.401
…like wild rams.

36:36.569 --> 36:40.572
They was always fighting so you couldn't sleep
at night for the din of their fighting.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.128
The son of God goes forth to war

36:55.296 --> 36:59.591
A kingly crown to gain

36:59.926 --> 37:03.345
His blood-red banner streams afar

37:03.512 --> 37:06.890
Who follows in his train?

37:07.308 --> 37:09.476
For God's sake, Danny, pipe down.

37:09.644 --> 37:12.020
Why? Who's going to hear us up here?

37:12.188 --> 37:15.607
These mountains, that's who.
Do you want to start an avalanche?

37:15.816 --> 37:18.693
God, you don't believe
that kind of foolishness, I hope.

37:18.861 --> 37:22.405
If a king can't sing,
it ain't worth being king.

37:22.573 --> 37:25.659
A glorious band, the chosen few…

37:26.160 --> 37:30.789
The country was most mountainous
and the mules was most contrary.

37:30.957 --> 37:35.085
They all died but one,
and she died later on.

37:35.878 --> 37:40.715
Danny went snow-blind
and clung to Jenny's tail.

37:41.342 --> 37:42.717
Up and up we went…

37:43.010 --> 37:46.513
…and down, and down, through defiles…

37:46.681 --> 37:50.433
…and over snowy saddles,
till all at once…

37:51.185 --> 37:53.853
…two giants stood in our way.

37:59.902 --> 38:01.820
God's holy trousers.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.363
What's the matter, Peachy?

38:03.531 --> 38:07.742
Blokes twice our size,
standing guard in the snow, like.

38:07.910 --> 38:10.453
- Two of them.
- Give them a round apiece.

38:20.214 --> 38:22.299
Not a move out of them.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.050
Stay put.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.720
I'll reconnoiter.

38:35.354 --> 38:36.813
They're not real, thank God.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.357
They're horrible.

38:41.068 --> 38:44.779
Put there by the Kafiris
to frighten the neighbors, no doubt.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.614
Peachy…

38:46.782 --> 38:49.743
…that means we're in Kafiristan
or almost.

38:50.244 --> 38:51.703
So it does.

38:53.914 --> 38:55.999
What was that?

38:56.250 --> 38:58.626
Our bridges have been burnt,
so to speak.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.337
What do you mean?

39:00.504 --> 39:04.090
The bridge we crossed by
ain't there no longer.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.551
What?

39:22.234 --> 39:23.568
Now what?

39:24.403 --> 39:25.528
Well, tell me.

39:25.696 --> 39:26.863
A crevasse.

39:27.448 --> 39:30.408
We've had it, Danny, coming and going.

39:30.576 --> 39:32.619
- Wide?
- Wide enough.

39:32.787 --> 39:36.790
It drops into nothing below,
straight as a beggar can spit.

39:40.127 --> 39:42.003
That's the last of them Peachy.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.256
No more gods to burn.

39:46.133 --> 39:48.927
It looks like "Last Post," Danny.

39:50.930 --> 39:53.014
I don't fancy dying by inches…

39:53.307 --> 39:56.976
…feeling the cold creeping up
my arms and legs, getting all numb.

39:57.686 --> 40:01.481
I'll do the necessary
when the fire goes out.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.400
Fair enough.

40:05.152 --> 40:07.028
Ain't it a bloody shame though, eh?

40:07.196 --> 40:09.739
Our getting this close and not making it.

40:11.409 --> 40:15.161
A stone's throw away, our kingdom.

40:16.872 --> 40:21.334
I'd have like to seen you, Danny,
with a gold crown on your head…

40:21.502 --> 40:23.628
…if you could've found
one that fitted it.

40:27.299 --> 40:30.927
Peachy, in your opinion…

40:31.345 --> 40:33.763
…have our lives been misspent?

40:35.766 --> 40:38.685
Well, that depends on how you look at it.

40:39.186 --> 40:42.397
I wouldn't say the world's a better place
for our having lived in it.

40:42.565 --> 40:43.857
No, hardly that.

40:44.024 --> 40:46.317
Nobody's gonna weep their eyes out
at our demise.

40:46.485 --> 40:48.361
And who'd want them to anyway?

40:48.529 --> 40:51.197
And we haven't many good deeds
to our credit.

40:52.825 --> 40:56.327
None. None to brag about.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.997
But how many men have been
where we've been…

40:59.165 --> 41:00.790
…and seen what we've seen?

41:00.958 --> 41:03.168
Bloody few, and that's a fact.

41:03.544 --> 41:07.714
Why, even now, I wouldn't change places
with the viceroy himself…

41:07.882 --> 41:09.716
…if it meant giving up my memories.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.426
Me neither.

41:14.096 --> 41:18.016
Do you remember the time the Highlanders
was retreating down the hill…

41:18.309 --> 41:19.767
- …at Ali Masjid…
- Ali Masjid.

41:19.935 --> 41:23.605
…and Pipe Major McCrimmon
got his sporran shot off? Ha, ha, ha.

41:24.064 --> 41:25.732
Half a crown was in it, right?

41:25.900 --> 41:29.652
So back he goes after it without even
looking to see if that was all he'd lost.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.865
- And then he got the Victoria Cross…
- Victoria Cross.

41:34.033 --> 41:37.076
…because the bloody Highlanders turned
around and followed him up the hill.

42:26.001 --> 42:27.544
Danny.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.963
We could get on.

42:55.656 --> 42:57.699
Kafiristan.

42:58.492 --> 43:00.660
The promised land.

43:58.594 --> 44:00.345
Hee-yah!

44:55.651 --> 44:57.860
Must be their Halloween.

45:08.330 --> 45:10.498
Upsadaisy, lad.

45:25.514 --> 45:29.726
Brass band and all.
Hail the conquering heroes.

45:39.695 --> 45:40.862
Bloody cheek.

45:41.029 --> 45:42.655
Where's their gratitude?

45:43.115 --> 45:44.866
I say…

45:45.033 --> 45:46.284
I say there…

45:46.660 --> 45:48.494
Are you Englishmen, please?

45:49.329 --> 45:51.831
Stone the bleeding crows.

45:52.166 --> 45:53.499
Yes, mate.

45:53.667 --> 45:55.793
And who might you be?

46:18.942 --> 46:21.027
Peachy, it's a Gurkha.

46:21.862 --> 46:26.449
Rifleman Machendra Bahadur Garung,
known to my regimen as Billy Fish.

46:26.700 --> 46:27.867
Is that right?

46:28.035 --> 46:31.996
Well, report, rifleman. What are
you doing here, wherever here is?

46:32.581 --> 46:34.749
I come with Colonel Robertson, sir.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.542
The geographer's party?

46:36.710 --> 46:38.503
Dear me, alas, by Jove.

46:38.670 --> 46:42.340
Party not reaching Er Heb
for very misfortunate reasons.

46:42.508 --> 46:46.052
Large mountain is falling on the heads
of Colonel Robertson and others.

46:46.220 --> 46:49.931
Everybody buried alive,
except your servant.

46:50.557 --> 46:53.893
What about them up there,
banging drums and blowing horns…

46:54.061 --> 46:55.686
…and then shooting arrows at us?

46:56.146 --> 46:59.398
Oh. Big noise,
intended to scare away devils.

46:59.900 --> 47:02.026
Many devils here these days, you know?

47:02.194 --> 47:03.736
They thought we was devils?

47:03.904 --> 47:06.155
Kafiristan peoples very ignorant.

47:06.323 --> 47:08.074
I say to Headman Ootah…

47:08.283 --> 47:11.369
…I say, oh, no, by Jove,
they're not devils…

47:11.537 --> 47:14.163
…they gorasahibs,
British soldiers.

47:14.498 --> 47:15.873
Good man, Billy Fish.

47:16.291 --> 47:19.627
And now, if you will take us
to this Ootah bloke…

47:19.795 --> 47:21.295
…we will begin his education.

48:09.052 --> 48:10.553
Ootah!

48:16.018 --> 48:17.518
Ootah!

48:21.481 --> 48:22.815
Ootah!

48:27.863 --> 48:29.155
Ootah!

48:41.960 --> 48:44.921
Tell him we won't hurt him, not to worry.

49:03.482 --> 49:05.900
He wants to know where you come from.

49:06.193 --> 49:09.487
Tell him we tumbled from the skies.

49:11.823 --> 49:13.199
Ah.

49:15.494 --> 49:17.203
He wants to know are you gods?

49:17.412 --> 49:20.581
Not gods, Englishmen,
which is the next best thing.

49:26.088 --> 49:29.090
I ofttimes tell Ootah
about Englishmans…

49:29.257 --> 49:32.176
…how they give names to dogs
and take off hats to womans…

49:32.344 --> 49:35.972
…and march into battle, left, right,
with rifles on their shoulders.

49:36.139 --> 49:39.100
Bringing enlightenment
to the darker regions of the earth.

49:42.229 --> 49:44.021
He wants to know how rifle works.

49:49.861 --> 49:51.612
Show him, Peachy.

50:04.459 --> 50:06.419
We are not gods exactly…

50:06.586 --> 50:10.297
…but we are heaven-sent to deliver you
from your enemies.

50:17.180 --> 50:18.931
Enemies all around.

50:20.434 --> 50:22.435
The Bashkai are the worst.

50:27.274 --> 50:31.569
Whole town comes out and pisses
downstream when we go bathing.

50:31.737 --> 50:33.112
Shocking.

50:35.657 --> 50:37.533
They are always killing our womans.

50:39.578 --> 50:41.454
Putting on masks…

50:43.874 --> 50:47.752
…so Er Heb chap is thinking them devils
and running like the bloody hell away.

50:47.919 --> 50:51.297
War. Red war we'll give them.

50:54.217 --> 50:58.429
He says he give you two goats
for each Bashkai man you're killing.

51:02.017 --> 51:04.268
One goat for each womans and childs.

51:04.436 --> 51:05.519
A handsome offer.

51:05.687 --> 51:08.022
But rather than knocking them over
one at a time…

51:08.190 --> 51:10.649
…we'd like to do the whole thing
in one foul swoop.

51:10.817 --> 51:14.445
Serve him up a proper victory.
Storm Bashkai, take the city.

51:20.202 --> 51:21.911
He says how much for all that?

51:22.079 --> 51:23.370
Only the honor…

51:23.538 --> 51:27.041
…of leading the brave men
of Er Heb into battle.

51:32.547 --> 51:34.965
Plus whatever we may fancy
in the way of souvenirs.

51:35.675 --> 51:37.343
A bauble here and a bangle there.

51:40.138 --> 51:44.141
Bashkai is only the beginning.
We hope to go on from victory to victory…

51:44.309 --> 51:46.352
…until he runs out of enemies.

51:48.230 --> 51:50.564
And a monarch of all you survey.

51:55.195 --> 51:56.320
All he surveys?

51:56.488 --> 51:59.406
From the highest place in the valley.

52:01.326 --> 52:04.411
The mountains will echo your name.

52:07.707 --> 52:09.500
Ootah the Great.

52:19.052 --> 52:21.178
He says he prefers Ootah the Terrible.

52:21.346 --> 52:24.807
Then Ootah the Terrible it shall be.

52:30.772 --> 52:33.941
And take him in token of our earnest.

52:37.571 --> 52:41.574
And now the womans of Er Heb
will cut his bullocks off. Ha, ha, ha.

52:41.741 --> 52:44.451
Couldn't happen in a better cause.

53:32.792 --> 53:34.710
- Contract.
- Contract.

53:43.637 --> 53:45.846
Ootah say, "You no like?"

53:47.057 --> 53:49.266
Tell His Highness
we've given up strong drink…

53:49.434 --> 53:51.810
…until we've conquered all his enemies.

54:01.988 --> 54:06.242
Boil them once or twice in hot water and
they'll come out like chicken and ham.

54:06.952 --> 54:10.037
You wouldn't know them
from the Gaiety chorus.

54:14.167 --> 54:16.585
Ootah says take your pick.

54:18.088 --> 54:19.546
He does?

54:21.007 --> 54:23.425
Tell His Majesty…

54:23.593 --> 54:25.427
…one's prettier than another.

54:26.179 --> 54:27.179
I couldn't choose.

54:27.347 --> 54:29.515
Take two, take three,
take as many as you like.

54:29.683 --> 54:31.600
There are more where they came from.

54:31.768 --> 54:33.269
He has 27 daughters.

54:33.436 --> 54:37.231
They're his daughters?
His own daughters?

54:37.399 --> 54:38.857
The dirty old brute.

54:39.025 --> 54:44.196
Different countries, different customs.
Mustn't be prejudiced, Peachy.

54:44.406 --> 54:47.283
Thank His Majesty
but tell him we've also taken a vow…

54:47.450 --> 54:52.121
…not to dally with females
till all his enemies are vanquished.

55:02.173 --> 55:05.676
He has 32 sons if you're liking boys.

55:08.054 --> 55:09.972
Tell him he makes my gorge to rise.
Go on.

55:10.140 --> 55:15.227
Hold on, Peachy, he's only being
hospitable according to his likes.

55:23.903 --> 55:25.571
Polo.

55:55.185 --> 55:58.437
Everything's the same as ours
except the ball. It's bigger.

55:58.605 --> 56:00.522
Do they always use that bigger ball?

56:00.690 --> 56:04.943
It depend on size of man's head. Big
head, big ball. This your Bashkai man.

56:05.111 --> 56:07.279
Big damn head.

56:07.572 --> 56:08.864
The bloody heathens.

56:09.032 --> 56:13.786
Different countries, different customs.
Mustn't be prejudiced, Danny.

56:15.413 --> 56:17.790
Now, listen to me,
you benighted muckers.

56:20.335 --> 56:24.838
We're gonna teach you soldiering,
the world's noblest profession.

56:25.757 --> 56:28.300
When we've done with you,
you'll be able to stand up…

56:28.468 --> 56:32.137
…and slaughter your enemies
like civilized men.

56:32.305 --> 56:36.642
But first, you'll have to learn
to march in step.

56:36.810 --> 56:40.479
Do the manual of arms
without even having to think.

56:40.647 --> 56:44.775
Good soldiers don't think,
they just obey.

56:46.194 --> 56:49.905
Do you suppose if a man thought twice,
he'd give his life for queen and country?

56:50.073 --> 56:53.158
Not bloody likely.
He wouldn't go near the battlefield.

56:54.869 --> 56:58.122
One look at your foolish faces…

56:58.289 --> 57:02.126
…tells me you're going to be
crack troops.

57:02.293 --> 57:07.423
Him there with a five-and-a-half
hat size has the makings of a bloody hero.

57:15.974 --> 57:20.269
Now the timing in the British army
has always been one, two, three.

57:20.687 --> 57:21.937
One, two, three.

57:23.481 --> 57:24.648
One, two, three.

57:24.816 --> 57:27.943
Say after me: One, two, three.

57:29.571 --> 57:31.655
One, two, three.

57:32.866 --> 57:34.658
Ready, steady, go.

57:34.826 --> 57:36.743
One, two, three.

57:36.911 --> 57:39.746
One, two, three.

57:40.248 --> 57:43.333
You say it at the same time
as all the others, right?

57:43.501 --> 57:45.794
Tell him to say it the same time
as all the others.

57:48.882 --> 57:50.591
Right. Go.

57:50.758 --> 57:52.426
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

57:52.594 --> 57:54.344
One, two, three.

57:54.512 --> 57:57.723
Billy, tell him to say it with the others.
With the others.

57:58.308 --> 57:59.683
One, two, three.

57:59.851 --> 58:02.060
All right. Now ready, steady, go.

58:02.228 --> 58:03.687
One, two, three.

58:03.855 --> 58:07.399
You don't say it before the others.
He's saying it before the others, Billy.

58:07.567 --> 58:11.695
Not before the others, not after
the others. With the bloody others.

58:11.863 --> 58:15.240
Right. Attention.

58:16.242 --> 58:18.452
Now, you, look…

58:20.121 --> 58:24.249
That one goes to there.
Say that one goes to there, that's it.

58:26.586 --> 58:30.422
Down there like that.
There we are. You okay? Right.

58:30.590 --> 58:32.674
Blimey.

58:50.109 --> 58:52.444
Come on, smarten up,
you horrible lot.

58:53.279 --> 58:55.280
Attention.

58:55.448 --> 58:57.074
That's better.

58:57.242 --> 58:59.910
Troops, march.

59:02.789 --> 59:05.999
Regiment, quick march.

59:06.167 --> 59:10.629
Left, left, left, right, left.

59:22.058 --> 59:26.186
Now, wait a minute, ducks, you're
a handsome piece, that I don't deny…

59:26.354 --> 59:28.146
…but the contract clearly states…

59:28.314 --> 59:30.816
…that the party of the first part,
which is Danny…

59:30.984 --> 59:34.736
…and the party of the second part,
which is me…

59:35.238 --> 59:37.781
…shall nowise compromise ourselves…

59:38.241 --> 59:41.243
…with parties of the third part,
which is you.

59:41.786 --> 59:44.204
All binding, properly sworn to…

59:44.747 --> 59:47.708
…witnessed and attested.

59:49.085 --> 59:51.336
- Danny.
- Shaw.

59:52.088 --> 59:54.339
Thank God you arrived.

59:54.716 --> 59:57.342
Let's go and seek safety in battle.

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:27.664
Trumpeter, sound your trumpet.

01:01:00.239 --> 01:01:02.074
Billy Fish.

01:01:04.577 --> 01:01:08.413
Blood is what we want, the bloodier
the better. So see that it is so.

01:01:08.581 --> 01:01:10.749
So it shall be, huzoor.

01:01:13.586 --> 01:01:16.922
Like old times, Peachy.
Reminds me of Ali Masjid.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:20.092
It's a good job,
the odds are only 10-to-1.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:33.897
Halt.

01:01:38.152 --> 01:01:41.071
Line up in a straight line here.

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:01.633
Present.

01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:04.636
Aim!

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:35.917
Who are they?

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:37.753
What's happening?

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:42.132
Very holy men. They make walks
through all Kafiristan…

01:02:42.675 --> 01:02:44.634
…collecting offerings for Holy City.

01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:48.138
Battle is postponed…

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:50.223
…until priests are passed.

01:02:51.517 --> 01:02:53.351
Why have they got their eyes closed?

01:02:53.519 --> 01:02:57.689
They do not wish to see any badness,
so keep eyes closed…

01:02:58.149 --> 01:03:01.902
…until they return
to beauties of Sikandergul.

01:03:31.557 --> 01:03:33.141
Fire!

01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:38.438
Aim! Fire!

01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:41.107
Reload!

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.237
Forward!

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.239
Mutiny!

01:03:47.406 --> 01:03:50.909
The great bloody show-off.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:53.203
Rifle section, form line.

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:56.039
Fix bayonets.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.562
Advance.

01:04:18.729 --> 01:04:20.063
Volley fire.

01:04:20.231 --> 01:04:21.439
Commence fire.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:24.734
Charge!

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.835
And what, may I ask,
did you think you were playing at…

01:06:06.003 --> 01:06:07.837
…charging the enemy single-handed?

01:06:08.005 --> 01:06:11.007
I got carried away, heat of the moment,
the blood was up.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:14.844
Acting like some green lieutenant
hoping to be mentioned in dispatches.

01:06:15.012 --> 01:06:17.597
A man of your age,
you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

01:06:17.765 --> 01:06:18.807
Sorry.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:22.185
Supposing you got killed?
Supposing that? Where would I be at?

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:23.395
It won't happen again.

01:06:23.562 --> 01:06:26.398
See it don't. And what are you carrying
that arrow around for?

01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:29.567
- No particular reason.
- I've never seen anything like it in me life.

01:06:35.908 --> 01:06:38.785
Hold on, laddy buck. What's he up to?

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.591
He say he great warrior.
He win this big battle…

01:06:53.759 --> 01:06:56.261
…and now according to custom
he lop off their heads.

01:06:56.429 --> 01:07:00.724
Great warrior, eh? Well, I never saw him
in the thick of the fray.

01:07:00.933 --> 01:07:03.893
There'll be no execution
of prisoners in this army.

01:07:04.061 --> 01:07:06.104
Tell him to put that sword away.

01:07:11.777 --> 01:07:14.904
He says once sword unsheathed,
it must taste blood.

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:17.782
Just as I thought,
he hasn't had it out until now.

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:28.293
He says watch out or he get very angry
and lop your head off.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:44.392
All right, up you get, off your hunkers.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.852
No more groveling.

01:07:47.813 --> 01:07:49.981
We ain't gonna put your city
to the torch…

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:53.485
…or hang you in chains
nor rape your daughters.

01:07:55.529 --> 01:07:57.614
Tell them to divide their goods in half…

01:07:57.782 --> 01:08:00.658
…and we will choose
which half we want, in the way of spoils.

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:10.835
Henceforth, let the men of Er Heb
and the men of Bashkai be as brothers.

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:13.171
Brothers in arms.

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:15.673
Let them march together
under one banner…

01:08:15.841 --> 01:08:18.593
…and share and share alike
in the victories to come.

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:27.560
Have the Bashkai any enemies
to speak of?

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:32.732
Oh, enemies all around.

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:36.402
The Bhardoks, the Ghundaras,
the Shus, the Khawaks.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:42.658
The Bhardoks people coming out and
pissing downstream on Bashkai people…

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:43.910
…when they go bathing.

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:45.120
Shocking.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.956
We'll strike them down
and grind them into dust.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.465
Silver bracelet, ten shillings.

01:08:57.675 --> 01:09:02.053
A good heavy necklace of the same,
worth a fiver at least.

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:05.515
Earring with bangles.

01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:09.477
One pig sticker with plain handle.

01:09:10.395 --> 01:09:13.773
A gold coin, worn pretty thin.

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:19.654
A rosy red ring
and a few other ones, plain.

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:23.408
The whole lot should fetch ten
or fifteen quid in an able shop in London.

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:26.118
Not too bad for the back of beyond.

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.663
Sikander, Sikander, Sikander.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.916
They're calling for you.

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:35.127
For me?

01:09:36.796 --> 01:09:41.091
Sikander, Sikander, Sikander.

01:09:57.109 --> 01:10:00.320
Sikander. Sikander.

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:03.114
What does Sikander mean, Billy?

01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:07.452
Sikander a god.
Come here long ago from the west.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:11.206
Yeah, that'll be the Greek bloke
brother Kipling told us about.

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:12.624
Alexander?

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.626
Alexander. Sikander.

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:18.296
Yeah. Alexander.

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:20.340
He builded great city…

01:10:20.507 --> 01:10:22.800
…Sikandergul, high in mountains.

01:10:22.968 --> 01:10:26.346
Sit on throne, all peoples worship him.

01:10:26.513 --> 01:10:30.683
Then one day, time comes,
he say he must go to east.

01:10:30.851 --> 01:10:33.645
People pull their hairs
out, tear clothes…

01:10:33.812 --> 01:10:37.774
…so Sikander promise to send back son.

01:10:37.942 --> 01:10:39.817
328 B.C…

01:10:40.194 --> 01:10:41.527
…the encyclopedia said.

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:45.156
Soldiers saw arrow go
into Danny's chest…

01:10:45.324 --> 01:10:47.825
…him pluck it out and not bleeding.

01:10:49.203 --> 01:10:50.328
So?

01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:53.873
So son of Sikander.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.376
They think I'm a god?

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:04.467
A god. Put your foot out
that I may kiss your big toe.

01:11:05.177 --> 01:11:06.469
You may kiss my royal arse.

01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:10.098
Not royal, holy.
You're a deity, remember?

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:13.268
- Peachy?
- Yes, Billy.

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.436
Is Danny not son of Sikander?

01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:17.647
No, Billy, he's a man like you and me.

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:20.191
He can break wind
at both ends simultaneous.

01:11:20.484 --> 01:11:23.027
Which, I'm willing to bet,
is more than any god can do.

01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:25.488
But the arrow…

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.158
The arrow stuck in the bandoleer.

01:11:29.326 --> 01:11:32.495
There was no miracle, Billy,
so you'd better tell them out there.

01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:35.915
And my dad's name was
Herbert Dravot, Esquire…

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:38.710
…and he was bar steward
in a knocking shop in Durham.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.712
Hang on a minute, Danny.

01:11:51.932 --> 01:11:53.766
Maybe we're missing a bet here.

01:11:53.934 --> 01:11:55.059
What do you mean?

01:11:55.227 --> 01:11:57.562
Supposing you was an ignorant Kafiri…

01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:00.106
…who would you rather follow,
a god or a man?

01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:05.653
Now, we're here to conquer
this country, ain't we?

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:11.159
Well, with you as a god, it would take
half the time and half the trouble.

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:14.370
The idea's a bit blasphemous-like.

01:12:14.538 --> 01:12:20.918
No, Danny, blaspheming is
when you take his name in vain…

01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:23.921
…God Almighty's.

01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:27.592
And what if they found out
we was having them on?

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:32.055
Why should they? We won't tell them.

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:37.435
And you won't tell them, will you, Billy?

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:40.730
Oh, no, indeed by Jove, no.

01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:48.112
Polo?

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.407
Polo.

01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:18.017
Er Heb and Bashkai people
celebrate new brotherhood.

01:13:18.185 --> 01:13:20.770
- With whose head?
- Ootah's.

01:13:32.866 --> 01:13:35.785
We marched and fought
and took more villages.

01:13:35.994 --> 01:13:37.745
Our ranks swelled.

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:40.039
They were well-trained and disciplined…

01:13:40.207 --> 01:13:43.209
…but with Danny at their head,
Sikander the Second…

01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:45.711
…they were also inspired.

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:07.335
Sikander, Sikander, Sikander.

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:12.089
After half a dozen victories…

01:15:12.257 --> 01:15:15.718
…his fame was such
that there was no more fighting.

01:15:15.886 --> 01:15:19.013
We was met with gifts
and bevies of maidens…

01:15:19.264 --> 01:15:22.058
…who danced and threw flowers.

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:05.768
Girl.

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:27.748
Venus de Milo in the flesh, if flesh it is,
and not Guinness and champagne.

01:16:28.166 --> 01:16:30.835
Billy, tell her to stand up
and turn around.

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:44.432
Just gazing, Peachy, just gazing.

01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:48.978
There's such a thing as enjoying beauty
for its own sake.

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:50.896
Being only human…

01:16:51.064 --> 01:16:53.274
…one thing leads to another.

01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:55.568
Give her a hat with
an ostrich feather in it…

01:16:55.736 --> 01:16:59.864
…and there'll be no girl in Brighton on
a bank holiday could hold a candle to her.

01:17:01.033 --> 01:17:02.199
I must admit…

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:05.536
…she really is an eyeful.

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:08.623
What's your name, girl?

01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:12.752
Roxanne.

01:17:12.919 --> 01:17:15.254
- Roxanne.
- Hey.

01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:18.799
Wasn't that the name
of the princess that Alexander married?

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.009
It was that.

01:17:28.894 --> 01:17:30.436
Hold your head up.

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:42.490
- Girl afraid.
- Of what?

01:17:43.116 --> 01:17:46.702
If god takes a girl,
she catches fire and go up in smoke.

01:17:47.371 --> 01:17:48.621
They do what?

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:53.501
God's heart a burning torch,
his veins run fire, not blood.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:57.129
If god makes love to girl,
she goes "Kaa-choom!"

01:17:57.589 --> 01:18:00.424
In one flash. Not even any ashes left.

01:18:00.592 --> 01:18:03.719
I bet that was made up
by some jealous goddess.

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:29.453
They come from Holy City
of Sikandergul…

01:18:29.621 --> 01:18:33.457
…with a message for the one
who calls himself Son of Sikander.

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:37.503
Tell them they're looking at him,
or would be if they opened their eyes.

01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:44.719
The message comes from Kafu Selim.

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:46.804
- Who?
- Kafu Selim.

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:49.807
High priest of all Kafiristan.

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:53.728
What's the message?

01:18:56.523 --> 01:18:57.898
Kafu Selim says come.

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:00.818
Come?

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:04.405
- Is that all?
- That's all, just come.

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:07.074
Doesn't waste words, does he?

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:09.952
You tell Kafu Selim
that we appreciate the invitation…

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.872
…and that we will avail ourselves of it
one of these days.

01:19:13.039 --> 01:19:16.500
- No, come means come now, today.
- Oh.

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:21.005
What does he want to see us about,
or didn't he say?

01:19:21.173 --> 01:19:22.673
He just says come.

01:19:23.508 --> 01:19:24.759
I see.

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:27.845
All right, well, tell him to stand by…

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:30.681
…and the army will be ready
by first light.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:40.274
He says no. You come alone,
him and you.

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.193
Without the army?

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.487
You tell Kafu Selim
or whatever his name is…

01:19:44.654 --> 01:19:48.115
…Peachy and me don't go anywhere
without the army goes with us.

01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:50.075
Shut up, Danny.

01:19:52.204 --> 01:19:54.038
We have to go.

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:55.498
Have you gone starky?

01:19:55.665 --> 01:19:57.917
Keep your voice down
and put a smile on your face.

01:19:58.084 --> 01:20:00.252
We've got an audience, remember?

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.380
Peachy, we'd be stone bonkers…

01:20:03.548 --> 01:20:06.509
…to walk into a strange city
by our lonesomes.

01:20:07.385 --> 01:20:10.387
Either we do what they say
or we pull stumps and run.

01:20:10.555 --> 01:20:13.140
Make a beeline for the mountains
as soon as it's dark…

01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:15.518
…and never look back at Kafiristan.

01:20:15.685 --> 01:20:19.063
Run? Not bloody likely.
Run from the likes of them?

01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:20.481
No…

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:21.941
…from our blokes.

01:20:22.567 --> 01:20:24.276
We're over a barrel, Danny.

01:20:24.444 --> 01:20:27.404
If we break away from a meeting
with old Kafu Selim…

01:20:27.572 --> 01:20:32.368
…we'll lose face and that is the one thing
a god cannot afford.

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.746
What to do?

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:38.415
Bluff it out.

01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:42.670
Polish our buttons and leather, stuff
ramrods up our jacksies and look bold.

01:20:43.129 --> 01:20:47.091
Like we did when we were on charges
for drunk and resisting the guard.

01:21:38.184 --> 01:21:39.727
Sikandergul.

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:41.937
God's holy trousers.

01:22:17.974 --> 01:22:20.935
No weapons allowed in holy city.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:49.231
All right, you've got us here.

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:52.067
Now what? Hm?

01:23:57.824 --> 01:24:00.868
Where's your High Panjandrum? Hm?

01:24:19.137 --> 01:24:23.057
Afternoon, Your Reverence.
You said you wanted to see me?

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:39.823
Tell him he can keep it, Billy.
Tell him I'm making him a present of it.

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.126
What did he say, Billy?

01:24:51.294 --> 01:24:53.170
He say now we shall see.

01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:01.512
You mortals wait down there.

01:25:27.872 --> 01:25:31.041
Tell your filthy sods to take
their paws off me double quick…

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:33.710
…or by God,
I'll have their guts for garters!

01:25:33.878 --> 01:25:37.714
I'll pluck out your livers
and feed them to the kites.

01:25:38.508 --> 01:25:40.926
How dare you lay your hands on me…

01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:43.345
…Daniel Dravot, Esquire.

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:49.268
Sikander.

01:25:54.566 --> 01:25:56.400
Sikander.

01:25:58.403 --> 01:26:00.279
Sikander.

01:26:21.759 --> 01:26:23.969
Now what the bleeding hell?

01:26:25.096 --> 01:26:27.639
One minute he's about to cut
my bloody heart out…

01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:30.559
…the next minute
he's flat on his bleeding face.

01:26:30.768 --> 01:26:33.520
He saw that…

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:35.606
…and he dropped like he was poleaxed.

01:26:35.773 --> 01:26:37.232
What do you make of it?

01:26:38.943 --> 01:26:41.653
He says that is mark of Sikander.

01:27:13.937 --> 01:27:15.395
They're Masons.

01:27:16.105 --> 01:27:19.149
By the square, by the level,
by the plumb rule, by the compasses…

01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:22.361
…and by the all-seeing eye.
The craft, Danny, the craft.

01:27:22.779 --> 01:27:24.780
- That's what saved us.
- Blimey.

01:27:29.994 --> 01:27:32.871
Only highest of high priests
knows about this sign…

01:27:33.039 --> 01:27:35.540
…put in stone long ago by Sikander.

01:27:35.708 --> 01:27:40.128
Now Kafu Selim rejoicing
at the coming of his son.

01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:07.109
Sikander, Sikander, Sikander!

01:31:51.714 --> 01:31:53.798
It ain't brass, Danny.

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:22.744
Sikander?

01:32:22.912 --> 01:32:25.372
Belong to Sikander,
now Son of Sikander's.

01:32:35.466 --> 01:32:39.052
These here make the jewels
in the Tower of London…

01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:42.138
…look like cheap family heirlooms.

01:32:52.316 --> 01:32:54.484
God's holy trousers.

01:33:01.742 --> 01:33:04.244
Look at the size of that ruby.

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:13.003
There's a bigger one.

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:18.883
Why, Danny, we only have to fill
our pockets and walk out of here…

01:33:19.051 --> 01:33:21.303
…to be millionaires.

01:33:21.887 --> 01:33:23.763
And all of it…

01:33:24.682 --> 01:33:26.099
…all…

01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:29.644
…would make us
the two richest men in England.

01:33:29.812 --> 01:33:32.439
- The Empire.
- The world.

01:33:35.526 --> 01:33:37.861
But will they let us take it?

01:33:38.154 --> 01:33:40.363
Take it away, I mean?

01:33:43.492 --> 01:33:44.743
Ask him, Billy.

01:33:54.795 --> 01:33:58.923
He says belong to Son of Sikander,
can do with it what he likes.

01:33:59.842 --> 01:34:04.721
Leave it here, take away, no matter.
His will be done.

01:34:05.931 --> 01:34:08.892
We've mules enough, thank God…

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:11.603
…and riflemen to guard them
when the time comes.

01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:13.647
What month is it?

01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:16.900
January, I make it,
or maybe February.

01:34:17.068 --> 01:34:19.861
March, April, May, June…

01:34:20.029 --> 01:34:22.739
…four months of winter monsoon, then…

01:34:23.866 --> 01:34:26.409
Four long months.

01:34:26.911 --> 01:34:29.329
What'll we do with the time?

01:34:29.497 --> 01:34:32.165
Add up our blessings here…

01:34:32.333 --> 01:34:34.417
…divide them by two…

01:34:34.585 --> 01:34:36.086
…not forgetting you, Billy…

01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:41.549
…and multiply that
by the years we've got left.

01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:45.428
Tell His Reverence…

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:47.430
…he has my thanks…

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:50.392
…for discharging
his trust so correctly…

01:34:51.602 --> 01:34:54.020
…and delivering to me what is mine.

01:34:56.732 --> 01:35:01.820
And tell him I'm also grateful
to all them other holy men…

01:35:01.987 --> 01:35:05.615
…who waited for me,
from one generation to another…

01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:11.037
…down the centuries to this present day
and fortuitous occasion.

01:35:21.882 --> 01:35:26.052
My lord, these people are
from village of Kamdesh.

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:30.473
This man owns 60 cows…

01:35:30.641 --> 01:35:31.933
…all cows in the village.

01:35:32.101 --> 01:35:33.560
Very enterprising of him.

01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:37.147
Enterprise is not his, enterprise is hers.

01:35:38.816 --> 01:35:42.610
She's his wife, you see, and every time
he catches her with other mans…

01:35:42.778 --> 01:35:46.156
…other mans has to pay a forfeit
of six cows. Is Kafiri custom.

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:48.992
Use other man's wife, pay him six cows.

01:35:49.994 --> 01:35:54.080
You mean, he's piled up a fortune
of 60 cows out of her infidelities?

01:35:54.498 --> 01:35:56.708
And 32 goats.

01:35:57.752 --> 01:36:01.713
- She ain't a wife, she's a going concern.
- Ha.

01:36:03.507 --> 01:36:05.425
And these are the unfaithful husbands?

01:36:07.011 --> 01:36:08.178
And these the wives?

01:36:08.471 --> 01:36:09.971
Those four wives of one man.

01:36:10.389 --> 01:36:13.308
These three wives of another.
Those six of another.

01:36:15.519 --> 01:36:17.645
This ain't no laughing matter.

01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:21.316
Without cattle, there ain't no meat,
nor hides, nor hooves, nor horns.

01:36:21.484 --> 01:36:25.612
Without milk there ain't no butter nor
cheese and the children's bowls go empty.

01:36:26.363 --> 01:36:28.448
Outrageous it is.

01:36:32.536 --> 01:36:36.539
Now, for encouraging his wife
to comport herself like Jezebel…

01:36:36.707 --> 01:36:39.000
…one cow shall be paid
each of the other wives.

01:36:41.045 --> 01:36:44.088
For using a good law
for a bad purpose, another.

01:36:44.465 --> 01:36:47.842
For causing the young and innocent
to go without, a third.

01:36:48.677 --> 01:36:51.763
And for thinking he can
get away with it, a fourth.

01:36:52.181 --> 01:36:55.225
He shall pay 22 cases of compensation…

01:36:55.392 --> 01:36:57.519
…of four cows to each wife.

01:36:57.686 --> 01:37:00.396
Which means, she's got…

01:37:03.651 --> 01:37:04.734
Fourteen and two-thirds.

01:37:04.902 --> 01:37:09.364
Fourteen and two-thirds more
infidelities to commit, to come out even.

01:37:10.115 --> 01:37:13.743
Let her husband see how he likes it when
she's earning cows for somebody else.

01:37:13.911 --> 01:37:15.370
Next case.

01:37:35.599 --> 01:37:36.641
What's the charge?

01:37:36.809 --> 01:37:39.227
No charge, this chief from Agatsi…

01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:43.731
…which village have big fire and
winter supply of grains go up in smoke.

01:37:44.275 --> 01:37:48.820
Now chief want permission to raid
another village for to steal grain.

01:37:49.321 --> 01:37:52.198
They don't have to raid
and they won't starve neither.

01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:54.951
Make a proclamation, Billy.
What number is it?

01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:56.995
Thirty-one, my lord.

01:37:57.663 --> 01:38:01.165
Each and every village will bring
one-tenth of its crop here…

01:38:01.333 --> 01:38:03.084
…to my royal city of Sikandergul…

01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:06.129
…where same will be suitably stored.

01:38:06.297 --> 01:38:10.300
Henceforth, any village
suffering from privation…

01:38:10.467 --> 01:38:14.137
…shall have grain issued to it
in accordance with its needs.

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:17.807
I now pronounce this law enacted.
Selah.

01:38:17.975 --> 01:38:20.518
I also pronounce a five-minute recess
in this durbar.

01:38:20.686 --> 01:38:22.353
Yes, my lord.

01:38:28.319 --> 01:38:31.779
If we're gonna make it stick
that I'm a god…

01:38:32.323 --> 01:38:35.992
…you ought to bow when you pass
in front of me like everybody else.

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.164
All right, Danny.

01:38:41.332 --> 01:38:44.167
You understand, for appearance's sake.

01:38:44.335 --> 01:38:45.710
Yeah.

01:38:46.003 --> 01:38:47.503
No offense.

01:38:48.213 --> 01:38:50.506
No, no, of course not, Danny.

01:38:59.058 --> 01:39:02.226
You'd have to take your hat off
to Daniel Dravot.

01:39:02.394 --> 01:39:06.272
He dealt out justice as though
he wrote the book.

01:39:07.232 --> 01:39:10.109
Peachy was the general
of all his armies…

01:39:10.444 --> 01:39:12.904
…but there was no more
battles to be fought.

01:39:13.072 --> 01:39:15.198
So Danny put him to building a bridge…

01:39:15.366 --> 01:39:18.576
…that would span the chasm
below the holy city.

01:39:18.744 --> 01:39:22.914
It'd help keep Peachy occupied
till the spring came.

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:47.855
Look, Danny, the geese.
Skeins of them flying north.

01:39:48.023 --> 01:39:50.108
Another fortnight
and the pass will be open.

01:39:50.275 --> 01:39:53.653
Now, what we ought to do is
make camp high up on the mountain…

01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:55.822
…and wait on the weather.

01:40:04.707 --> 01:40:07.875
- I ain't going, Peachy.
- What?

01:40:10.254 --> 01:40:11.629
You heard me.

01:40:12.006 --> 01:40:14.674
- Not going?
- Correct.

01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:17.260
Have you gone barmy?

01:40:19.263 --> 01:40:22.390
No. I ain't been drinking neither.

01:40:24.768 --> 01:40:26.936
I see things clear.

01:40:28.355 --> 01:40:31.441
It's like bandages have been removed
from my eyes.

01:40:35.112 --> 01:40:37.864
Have you ever walked
into a strange room…

01:40:38.949 --> 01:40:42.910
- …and it's like you've been there before?
- Uh…

01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:46.414
- I know what you mean, yes.
- Let me tell you something.

01:40:46.582 --> 01:40:49.292
This isn't the first time
I wore a crown.

01:40:51.336 --> 01:40:54.047
There's more to this than meets the eye.

01:40:54.798 --> 01:40:56.549
It all adds up.

01:40:57.092 --> 01:40:58.676
What does?

01:40:59.053 --> 01:41:03.556
Everything that's happened from the time
we decided to come here.

01:41:04.683 --> 01:41:06.267
No, before that…

01:41:07.144 --> 01:41:10.354
…beginning with your taking
brother Kipling's watch.

01:41:12.066 --> 01:41:14.525
More than chance has been at work here.

01:41:14.693 --> 01:41:16.986
More than mere chance.

01:41:17.613 --> 01:41:20.448
Why his watch
and not somebody else's?

01:41:20.616 --> 01:41:23.076
And what made him
give me the emblem?

01:41:23.786 --> 01:41:25.787
One thing after the other.

01:41:26.163 --> 01:41:29.332
The avalanche, the arrow…

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:34.087
…the mark on the stone,
and not to mention, another Roxanne.

01:41:34.254 --> 01:41:35.546
Roxanne?

01:41:35.714 --> 01:41:37.048
The Venus de Milo?

01:41:37.299 --> 01:41:38.800
The same.

01:41:39.635 --> 01:41:44.305
One more thing is needful
for my destiny to be fulfilled.

01:41:44.473 --> 01:41:45.848
That I take her to wife.

01:41:46.016 --> 01:41:48.184
For God's sake, leave the women alone.

01:41:48.352 --> 01:41:50.603
Who's talking of women? I said wife.

01:41:51.021 --> 01:41:53.189
A queen to breed a king's son
for the king.

01:41:53.357 --> 01:41:54.565
What about the contract?

01:41:54.733 --> 01:41:57.568
The contract only lasted
until such time as we was kings…

01:41:57.736 --> 01:41:59.654
…and king I've been these months past.

01:41:59.863 --> 01:42:05.785
The first king here since Alexander,
the first to wear his crown in 2200 and…

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:08.788
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen years.

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:10.540
Him…

01:42:11.542 --> 01:42:13.209
…and now me.

01:42:15.921 --> 01:42:17.755
They call me his son and I am…

01:42:17.923 --> 01:42:20.800
…in spirit, anyway.

01:42:21.927 --> 01:42:24.554
It's a hugeous responsibility.

01:42:25.055 --> 01:42:27.682
The bridge we're building,
it's only the first of many.

01:42:27.850 --> 01:42:29.725
They'll tie the country together.

01:42:29.893 --> 01:42:33.938
A nation I shall make of it,
with an anthem and a flag.

01:42:34.106 --> 01:42:38.568
I shall treat on equal terms
the viceroy and other kings and princes.

01:42:38.735 --> 01:42:41.320
And when I've accomplished
what I set out to do…

01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:43.698
…I'll stand one day before the queen…

01:42:44.074 --> 01:42:47.660
…not kneel, mind you,
but stand like an equal.

01:42:47.953 --> 01:42:52.206
And she'll say, "I'd like you to accept
the Order of the Garter…

01:42:52.499 --> 01:42:56.085
…as a mark of my esteem, cousin."

01:42:56.295 --> 01:42:58.796
And she'll pin it on me herself.

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:02.091
It's big, I tell you, it's big.

01:43:02.259 --> 01:43:04.594
And I tell you, you need a physic.

01:43:05.762 --> 01:43:09.599
I'm fair disappointed in you, Peachy.
You of all men…

01:43:09.766 --> 01:43:12.185
…who followed me
and helped to make me what I am.

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:17.481
Followed you? Me? Who had hold
of the mule's tail, tell me that?

01:43:17.649 --> 01:43:19.984
The jenny also done her bit.

01:43:20.152 --> 01:43:23.779
Danny. Danny, we've had
this rare streak of luck.

01:43:23.947 --> 01:43:27.450
Let's quit winners for once.
Cut and run while the running's good.

01:43:27.618 --> 01:43:29.619
You call it luck.

01:43:30.037 --> 01:43:32.496
- I call it destiny.
- Ha, ha.

01:43:32.664 --> 01:43:35.374
Pardon me
while I fall down laughing.

01:43:37.586 --> 01:43:39.170
Whatever you may think…

01:43:39.338 --> 01:43:42.340
…and however you may feel,
I'm a king and you're a subject.

01:43:42.507 --> 01:43:45.509
So don't you provoke me,
Peachy Carnehan.

01:43:45.969 --> 01:43:47.428
Or you'll do what?

01:43:47.638 --> 01:43:51.140
You've got me trembling
in my boots here. What'll you do?

01:43:55.312 --> 01:43:57.313
You have our permission to bugger off.

01:43:57.522 --> 01:44:02.109
That I'll do, with or without
your bleeding permission.

01:44:04.571 --> 01:44:07.823
And may you rot in hell, Daniel Dravot.

01:44:09.034 --> 01:44:10.326
From Sikander the First…

01:44:10.869 --> 01:44:12.245
…to Sikander the Second…

01:44:12.454 --> 01:44:14.830
…was a long time between kings…

01:44:14.998 --> 01:44:18.668
…and a country needs a king,
like a king needs a crown.

01:44:18.835 --> 01:44:21.254
The one is the glory of the other.

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:24.757
Therefore, I shall leave a son
behind me…

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:27.468
…who will, in his turn,
beget other sons…

01:44:27.636 --> 01:44:29.887
…so the royal succession
will be unbroken…

01:44:30.055 --> 01:44:34.058
…and kings will be guaranteed
to you forever.

01:44:34.768 --> 01:44:36.686
To which end…

01:44:37.104 --> 01:44:39.313
…I have chosen a wife.

01:44:40.190 --> 01:44:42.483
Roxanne of Khawak.

01:45:02.713 --> 01:45:06.507
Let her be brought here,
attended by members of her family.

01:45:06.675 --> 01:45:09.552
I want flowers strewed along her way…

01:45:10.053 --> 01:45:14.765
…and the wedding ceremony will be
surrounded by pomp and circumstance.

01:45:14.933 --> 01:45:20.229
Let messengers be sent forth
and summon my people from near and far.

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:22.940
Selah.

01:45:42.085 --> 01:45:43.794
What are they saying, Billy Fish?

01:45:43.962 --> 01:45:47.757
How can daughters of men
marry gods or devils?

01:45:47.924 --> 01:45:50.926
- A god can do anything.
- But it is not proper.

01:45:51.386 --> 01:45:52.762
Who says it isn't?

01:45:52.971 --> 01:45:55.348
All the priests.

01:45:58.393 --> 01:46:01.020
Would they put their word
against that of a god?

01:46:05.692 --> 01:46:08.444
They say let Imbra decide.

01:46:09.071 --> 01:46:11.614
Imbra is highest god of all.

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:15.910
And what if Imbra should
hold against me?

01:46:16.078 --> 01:46:18.371
What'll they do about it?

01:46:19.498 --> 01:46:21.624
Am I a dog or a god?

01:46:21.792 --> 01:46:24.293
Haven't I put the shadow of my hand
over this country?

01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:29.882
Do as I say. Send for the girl.

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:32.468
Tell them that's an order.

01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:58.119
Well, Billy, what's going on?

01:46:58.286 --> 01:47:00.996
Signs very bad, Peachy.

01:47:01.164 --> 01:47:04.542
Priests open up birds,
all green inside and stinking most horrid.

01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:06.168
Imbra very angry.

01:47:06.336 --> 01:47:10.089
They probably cut the spleen,
the green's only bile.

01:47:11.174 --> 01:47:12.842
Don't worry, Billy…

01:47:13.009 --> 01:47:17.012
…the girl won't go up in smoke,
I'll guarantee you that.

01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:18.514
Girl don't matter…

01:47:18.682 --> 01:47:21.016
…many girls here, no difference.

01:47:21.184 --> 01:47:23.394
Few girls more or less.

01:47:23.562 --> 01:47:26.981
But cows now, they dry up…

01:47:27.149 --> 01:47:29.191
…and goats throw babies too soon.

01:47:29.901 --> 01:47:31.694
And corn do not ripen.

01:47:32.404 --> 01:47:33.863
Everybody go hungry.

01:47:34.072 --> 01:47:37.032
Now, Billy, you know as well as I do…

01:47:37.659 --> 01:47:39.827
…that Dravot's no god.

01:47:41.037 --> 01:47:42.872
He himself told you about the arrow.

01:47:43.206 --> 01:47:47.001
But then priests must be
mistaken about Imbra.

01:47:47.169 --> 01:47:49.545
He not angry because…

01:47:49.713 --> 01:47:51.422
…god marrying a mortal…

01:47:52.048 --> 01:47:55.384
…but because son of man
pretend to be a god.

01:49:37.487 --> 01:49:40.197
Roxanne, don't be afraid…

01:49:40.365 --> 01:49:42.283
…I wouldn't harm you.

01:49:43.368 --> 01:49:47.788
When the time comes,
you'll catch fire, I warrant…

01:49:47.956 --> 01:49:50.958
…like all women should
when their husbands hold them close.

01:49:51.543 --> 01:49:54.920
But you won't perish, girl,
I promise you that.

01:51:21.633 --> 01:51:23.342
Well, Danny…

01:51:23.968 --> 01:51:26.929
…the time has come, as the saying goes.

01:51:27.347 --> 01:51:28.847
When do you leave?

01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:30.683
At first light.

01:51:31.393 --> 01:51:35.604
I thought you might like to take a peek
in the boxes before I nail them shut…

01:51:36.231 --> 01:51:37.815
…see what I'm taking.

01:51:37.982 --> 01:51:39.024
Take what you like.

01:51:39.609 --> 01:51:41.443
I weighed the gold out,
pound for pound.

01:51:41.611 --> 01:51:44.113
The gems, ounce for ounce,
every jot and tittle.

01:51:44.322 --> 01:51:45.823
Right.

01:51:47.867 --> 01:51:50.786
I'll only need half the mules
we planned…

01:51:50.954 --> 01:51:53.414
…but I would like to take
all 20 riflemen…

01:51:53.998 --> 01:51:55.916
…to see me safe
through the Khyber Pass.

01:51:56.084 --> 01:51:58.669
Take them. Take them.

01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:08.387
God's holy trousers.

01:52:12.434 --> 01:52:14.476
What is that?

01:52:19.399 --> 01:52:22.025
They're savages here, one and all.

01:52:22.193 --> 01:52:24.319
Leave them to go back
to slaughtering babes…

01:52:24.487 --> 01:52:27.156
…and playing stick and ball
with one and other's heads…

01:52:27.323 --> 01:52:29.324
…and pissing on their neighbors.

01:52:33.079 --> 01:52:35.164
Please, Danny…

01:52:36.666 --> 01:52:38.792
…for the last time of asking…

01:52:40.086 --> 01:52:42.087
…come back with me.

01:52:42.964 --> 01:52:45.799
For the last time of answering, I won't.

01:52:46.509 --> 01:52:49.553
Peachy, I know you've got
my best interests at heart…

01:52:50.346 --> 01:52:52.514
…but the choice has been made.

01:52:53.183 --> 01:52:56.185
Well, I'll be seeing you, then.

01:52:56.811 --> 01:52:58.645
In London maybe…

01:53:01.524 --> 01:53:04.902
…when the queen gives you
the Order of the Garter.

01:53:14.370 --> 01:53:16.038
Peachy?

01:53:16.206 --> 01:53:18.916
- Yes, Danny.
- I'm to be married mid-morning.

01:53:19.334 --> 01:53:22.169
Could you not wait
and leave afterwards?

01:53:22.337 --> 01:53:24.588
See me up the aisle
for old times' sake, huh?

01:53:26.966 --> 01:53:28.717
If you like.

01:55:41.184 --> 01:55:42.976
Peachy, the ring.

01:55:48.024 --> 01:55:52.152
I, Sikander the Second,
hereby take thee, Roxanne…

01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:54.780
…to be my lawful wedded wife…

01:55:55.281 --> 01:55:57.616
…and Queen of Kafiristan.

01:55:58.326 --> 01:55:59.868
Selah.

01:56:15.218 --> 01:56:16.885
- Ahh!
- Argh!

01:56:18.054 --> 01:56:19.304
She bit me.

01:56:23.351 --> 01:56:25.394
The slut bit me.

01:56:51.337 --> 01:56:52.629
What's he saying, Billy?

01:56:52.839 --> 01:56:58.093
Danny's bleeding. They know.
He says not god, not devil, but man.

01:56:58.261 --> 01:57:00.846
They've twigged it, Danny. You've had it.

01:57:04.559 --> 01:57:05.892
The jig's up.

01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:08.603
- I, Sikander…
- For God's sake.

01:57:12.191 --> 01:57:17.070
We've got to brass it out, Danny.
Danny, brass it out.

01:57:24.662 --> 01:57:26.830
Bags of swank.

01:58:04.660 --> 01:58:08.497
We'll get your riflemen, Peachy,
we'll come back and slaughter the dogs.

01:58:18.466 --> 01:58:20.675
A drenching in their own blood,
we'll give them.

01:58:20.843 --> 01:58:22.969
Riflemen, prepare to advance.

01:58:23.137 --> 01:58:25.806
Too many for that, Danny.
Retire in sections.

01:58:26.015 --> 01:58:28.225
Retire? Retire be damned.

01:58:28.392 --> 01:58:29.810
We've gotta make a run for it.

01:58:34.190 --> 01:58:35.982
Front section.

01:58:36.359 --> 01:58:37.400
Fire!

01:58:39.695 --> 01:58:41.154
Back!

01:58:42.490 --> 01:58:44.866
Front rank. Fire!

01:58:45.034 --> 01:58:46.493
Back!

01:58:47.745 --> 01:58:49.621
Break ranks!

02:00:38.064 --> 02:00:40.482
Billy Fish, mount the mule and ride.

02:00:40.650 --> 02:00:42.150
There's a chance you'll make it.

02:00:42.318 --> 02:00:44.361
Gurkha foot soldier, not cavalry.

02:00:44.528 --> 02:00:49.449
Rifleman Machendra Bahadur Garung
wishing you many good lucks.

02:01:18.354 --> 02:01:22.315
- Out of bloody ammo.
- Me too.

02:01:42.837 --> 02:01:45.922
Peachy, I'm heartily ashamed
for getting you killed…

02:01:46.090 --> 02:01:48.550
…instead of going home rich
like you deserved to…

02:01:48.718 --> 02:01:53.013
…on account of me being
so bleeding high and bloody mighty.

02:01:53.597 --> 02:01:55.724
Can you forgive me?

02:01:57.727 --> 02:01:59.311
That I can…

02:01:59.603 --> 02:02:02.063
…and that I do, Danny.

02:02:02.231 --> 02:02:06.276
Free and full
and without let or hindrance.

02:02:06.444 --> 02:02:09.070
Everything's all right, then.

02:02:11.407 --> 02:02:15.243
The son of God goes forth to war

02:02:15.411 --> 02:02:19.581
A kingly crown to gain

02:02:19.749 --> 02:02:20.957
His blood-red banner…

02:03:17.306 --> 02:03:18.973
Cut you buggers, cut.

02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:27.482
A glorious band, the chosen few

02:03:27.650 --> 02:03:31.152
On whom the spirit came

02:03:32.321 --> 02:03:36.324
Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew

02:03:36.492 --> 02:03:40.912
And mocked the cross and flame

02:03:41.664 --> 02:03:45.875
He met the tyrant's brandished steel

02:03:46.043 --> 02:03:50.130
The lion's gory mane

02:03:50.297 --> 02:03:55.385
He bowed his head, his death to feel

02:04:01.684 --> 02:04:05.812
Who followed in his train?

02:04:09.817 --> 02:04:11.985
And old Danny fell…

02:04:12.153 --> 02:04:15.113
…round and round
and round and round…

02:04:15.281 --> 02:04:17.282
…like a penny whirligig.

02:04:17.783 --> 02:04:19.993
Twenty thousand miles.

02:04:20.202 --> 02:04:25.331
For it took him half an hour to fall
before he struck the rocks.

02:04:26.459 --> 02:04:29.961
And do you know
what they did to Peachy?

02:04:31.964 --> 02:04:34.340
They crucified him, sir…

02:04:35.342 --> 02:04:37.886
…between two pine trees…

02:04:38.637 --> 02:04:41.097
…as Peachy's hands…

02:04:41.682 --> 02:04:43.308
…will show.

02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:48.396
Poor Peachy, who'd never
done them any harm.

02:04:48.689 --> 02:04:52.901
He just hung there and he screamed,
but he didn't die.

02:04:53.235 --> 02:04:56.863
And the next day they come
and they took him down and they said…

02:04:57.031 --> 02:05:00.950
…it was a miracle he wasn't dead,
and they let him go.

02:05:02.661 --> 02:05:06.831
And Peachy come home in about a year…

02:05:07.124 --> 02:05:11.002
…and the mountains,
they tried to fall on old Peachy…

02:05:11.545 --> 02:05:17.008
…but he was quite safe because
Daniel walked before him.

02:05:19.637 --> 02:05:21.387
And Daniel never…

02:05:21.639 --> 02:05:23.765
…let go…

02:05:23.933 --> 02:05:26.100
…of Peachy's hand…

02:05:26.477 --> 02:05:29.771
…and Peachy never let go…

02:05:29.939 --> 02:05:31.189
…of Daniel's head.

02:05:33.067 --> 02:05:34.859
His head?

02:05:35.361 --> 02:05:38.780
- You knew Danny, sir.
- Oh, yes.

02:05:39.782 --> 02:05:41.157
You knew…

02:05:41.325 --> 02:05:44.786
…most worshipful brother…

02:05:46.539 --> 02:05:48.915
…Daniel Dravot, Esquire.

02:05:52.086 --> 02:05:53.920
Well, he became…

02:05:54.088 --> 02:05:57.507
…the King of Kafiristan…

02:05:58.342 --> 02:06:00.468
…with a crown on his head.

02:06:01.512 --> 02:06:03.972
And that's all there is to tell.

02:06:04.139 --> 02:06:09.227
I'll be on my way now, sir.
I've got urgent business in the south.

02:06:09.395 --> 02:06:12.772
I have to meet a man at Marwar Junction.
