TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.559 --> 00:07.080
-I cannot stress enough how
unprecedented this is.

00:07.120 --> 00:08.519
Normally, when a student
fails their exams--

00:08.560 --> 00:09.480
-Yeah, they're kicked out.

00:09.519 --> 00:10.480
I know.

00:10.519 --> 00:13.039
-I want to come back
to the Academy.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.480
I've kind of had feelings
for you since the

00:15.519 --> 00:17.079
start of last year.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.519
If I'm coming back to
the Academy, there

00:18.559 --> 00:20.559
needs to be a buffer.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.399
I can't train with you.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.280
I can't even be friends
with you.

00:24.320 --> 00:25.679
-That's crap.

00:25.719 --> 00:27.480
-If you choreograph my solo,
do I still get co-credit?

00:27.519 --> 00:28.079
-Hm.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.320
Nope.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.719
-There's a crack running right
through your L5 pars

00:37.759 --> 00:38.479
articularis.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.320
-I've broken my back?

00:40.359 --> 00:42.840
-Let's get you back
here in six weeks.

00:42.880 --> 00:46.719
Obviously, no dancing between
now and then.

00:46.759 --> 00:47.359
-What did the doctor say?

00:47.399 --> 00:48.159
-You were right.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.399
It was just a muscle strain.

00:50.439 --> 00:51.799
[theme music]

01:05.200 --> 01:07.519
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

01:07.560 --> 01:11.079
Close your eyes.

01:11.120 --> 01:15.439
Take a leap of faith and
lead away tonight.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.799
This is my chance.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.400
This is my chance.

01:23.439 --> 01:27.359
My chance to feel alive.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.760
Oh-oh.

01:29.799 --> 01:31.120
Oh-oh.

01:43.319 --> 01:44.280
-Sweetheart.

01:44.319 --> 01:46.359
Miss Raine's asking
you a question.

01:51.079 --> 01:53.719
-When did you first know
something was wrong?

01:53.760 --> 01:57.480
-There's always something wrong
with ballet school.

01:57.519 --> 01:58.879
You've got good pain.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.799
The kind of pain that should
make you a better dancer.

02:00.840 --> 02:05.319
And niggly pain, the kind of
pain that you want to go away.

02:05.359 --> 02:10.199
And bad pain, pain that you
should be scared of.

02:10.240 --> 02:12.639
Pain that could stop
you dancing.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.159
-Prix de Fonteyn requirement.

02:15.199 --> 02:16.080
They want to be aware of any

02:16.120 --> 02:17.599
potential or existing injuries.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.719
-Nothing?

02:26.759 --> 02:28.520
-I thought your back
was hurting, Tara.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.759
-It was just a muscle.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.000
It's better now.

02:34.039 --> 02:36.599
-We teach you here how to
tell the difference.

02:36.639 --> 02:37.800
-You're right.

02:37.840 --> 02:39.199
I knew it was the bad kind.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.240
-They hate us.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.840
-They're terrified of us.

02:46.879 --> 02:47.680
-Yay.

02:47.719 --> 02:49.319
The Academy students are here.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.599
-In my year, only three students
from the Academy made

02:51.639 --> 02:53.120
it into nationals.

02:53.159 --> 02:56.199
It was a huge scandal Anything
can happen on competition day.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.080
-Did I mention how much I love
my good luck present?

03:03.120 --> 03:05.400
We shall call him Shecky.

03:05.439 --> 03:07.319
-I didn't get you a turtle.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.319
-Oh.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.520
-Mr. Lieberman, I'll
see you first.

03:15.680 --> 03:16.840
-Good luck.

03:31.639 --> 03:34.520
-Always category champion.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.639
I figure it's going to be
you or me, but I have

03:36.680 --> 03:38.400
something you don't.

03:38.439 --> 03:39.159
-Yeah?

03:39.199 --> 03:40.680
What's that?

03:40.719 --> 03:41.840
-Killer instinct.

03:41.879 --> 03:42.680
So.

03:42.719 --> 03:45.400
Let's make things interesting.

03:45.439 --> 03:51.520
Whoever scores lowest has to
wear a tutu for a day.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.759
-I can't not see that.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.479
-Today, he doesn't exist.

03:58.520 --> 03:59.719
-Thank you.

04:04.759 --> 04:08.400
-Tara, you're moving especially
constipated today.

04:08.439 --> 04:10.080
I'm suppose to be
at the front.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.240
-I will see you wherever
you are.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.719
It's terrific to have
you all here.

of your judges today.

gonna start today with a

04:22.079 --> 04:23.560

04:23.600 --> 04:27.160
Then, this afternoon, you guys
are gonna show us your solos.

04:27.199 --> 04:28.600

-Good.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.399
I think.

05:37.439 --> 05:38.360

foot behind.

And to the corner.

One, two, three, four.

Four times on the diagonal,
then finish, OK?

06:45.319 --> 06:46.800
-Would you like doubles
or triples, Steven?

06:46.839 --> 06:47.560
STEVEN (OFFSCREEN): As
many as you can do.

but she said in

07:18.720 --> 07:20.639

-Yay.

08:55.519 --> 08:58.679
-For at least another
semester.

-Yeah.

-You were right.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.759
I'm hurt.

09:22.799 --> 09:25.440
I need to go get a massage or
painkiller before my solo.

09:25.480 --> 09:27.519
-Dr. Wicks won't let you dance
if you're injured.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.279
You're going to see a doctor
outside of the Academy.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.399
Tara, that's the most
fundamental rule.

09:35.440 --> 09:36.679
-Please don't say anything.

09:36.720 --> 09:39.399
GRACE (OFFSCREEN):
Ah, finally.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.159
-You wanna beat me, don't you?

09:41.200 --> 09:42.360
-I'm gonna beat you.

09:42.399 --> 09:45.360
-Won't it mean more if
I'm actually dancing?

09:45.399 --> 09:46.440
-Tara's disabled.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.320
And you still think you'll
be upstaged.

09:48.360 --> 09:49.519
-Grace.

10:01.559 --> 10:02.759
-Kisses.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.039
[music playing]

10:19.399 --> 10:20.799
-Please don't drag it out.

10:20.840 --> 10:22.720
Decapitation hurts less,
and it's clean.

10:31.279 --> 10:34.440
-The bad habit's ingrained
in your technique.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.279
You've been working the wrong
way for a long time.

10:36.320 --> 10:36.639
-You're right.

10:36.679 --> 10:37.679
I have.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.120
-Even more worrying is
your commitment.

10:40.159 --> 10:41.159
Last year--

10:41.200 --> 10:42.240
-I threw away my place
at the Academy.

10:42.279 --> 10:43.440
I know.

10:45.600 --> 10:50.159
I think this is the part where
I make the speech about how

10:50.200 --> 10:51.360
this isn't just a phase.

10:53.799 --> 10:58.279
How before, I was fighting
ballet because I never got to

10:58.320 --> 11:00.600
work out for myself
what it meant.

11:00.639 --> 11:02.279
I'm not going to make
that speech.

11:02.320 --> 11:04.440
I should have just danced well
enough to change your mind.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.559
-And where are you going?

11:11.600 --> 11:12.759
-Sorry?

11:16.840 --> 11:19.120
-We've got work to do.

11:19.159 --> 11:21.279
Y-You're letting me back
into the Academy?

11:21.320 --> 11:23.039
-This time on your own merit.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.600
-[squealing].

11:25.639 --> 11:26.559
-Oh.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.759
T-- that's really
not necessary.

11:27.799 --> 11:29.120
Katrina.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.759
-You've danced on this.

11:46.200 --> 11:49.639
Tara, if you keep going, there's
a good chance that you

11:49.679 --> 11:51.159
could break the other
side, and that's

11:51.200 --> 11:52.360
going to require surgery.

11:54.639 --> 11:56.120
-But if I stop, is
it definitely

11:56.159 --> 11:57.480
going to get better?

11:57.519 --> 12:01.159
Because I read somewhere that
sometimes these sorts of

12:01.200 --> 12:02.559
fractures never heal.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.600
-Well, sometimes.

12:03.639 --> 12:05.279
But we won't know for
about six weeks.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.399
-Hang on.

12:06.440 --> 12:09.080
So either way, she might
never dance again.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.279
-My immediate priority is to
relieve any discomfort, so I'm

12:12.320 --> 12:13.720
going to give you a
local anesthetic.

12:13.759 --> 12:15.440
But you have to promise
me that you won't

12:15.480 --> 12:16.639
keep dancing, OK?

12:19.480 --> 12:20.600
-I promise.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.440
-Saskia.

12:35.480 --> 12:38.639
I was just coming to talk
to you about Tara.

12:38.679 --> 12:41.159
I'm really worried about her.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.519
-Me too.

12:42.559 --> 12:44.000
The judges are going to
annihilate her this afternoon.

12:46.799 --> 12:51.000
Look, I know that this is a lot
to put on your shoulders,

12:51.039 --> 12:53.600
but I need at least one girl to
get through to nationals.

12:53.639 --> 12:56.159
And Grace is unpredictable.

12:58.799 --> 13:02.440
How well do you know

13:02.480 --> 13:08.159
"The Red Shoes?" -Hm.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.720
I've seen Tara struggle through
it a zillion times.

13:10.759 --> 13:13.600
But what about the piece Ethan
choreographed for me?

13:13.639 --> 13:20.320
-"The Red Shoes" when it's
performed right, unbeatable.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.679
-The parentals will be
beside themselves.

13:21.720 --> 13:22.279
-Heh.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.679
I know.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.519
-Oh, did you hear?

13:24.559 --> 13:25.600
I am golden child.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.080
-You're in?

13:27.120 --> 13:28.120
Yay.

13:28.159 --> 13:29.399
-Oh, and thank you so
much for Shecky.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.799
It was the good luck charm
that I needed.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.679
-I didn't get you a turtle.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.000
-No, a secret admirer,
Kitty Kat.

13:34.039 --> 13:34.639
-[laughs].

13:34.679 --> 13:36.000
-Heh.

13:39.799 --> 13:41.360
STEVEN (OFFSCREEN): Classical
variation will

13:41.399 --> 13:43.159
commence in 10 minutes.

13:43.200 --> 13:47.279
Please clear the stage.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.600
-Hey.

13:49.639 --> 13:51.759
So, I haven't changed my
socks in three days.

13:51.799 --> 13:53.120
It's a good luck ritual.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.679
-It's unnecessary.

13:56.720 --> 14:00.360
I've decided to go with
another solo.

14:00.399 --> 14:03.320
-What?

14:03.360 --> 14:05.399
But Abigail, we've been working
on this for weeks.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.720
-Mm-hm.

14:07.759 --> 14:08.679
-Hey.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.600
I know.

14:10.639 --> 14:12.159
It's risky going with
new choreography.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.000
But trust me, you're
gonna be fantastic.

14:15.039 --> 14:16.240
-Don't be churlish.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.759
Look, Ethan, you might need
it for your show reel,

14:21.799 --> 14:23.120
but I can do better.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.600
-Well, you do that, Abigail.

14:32.159 --> 14:34.120
-How has this been vaulted?

14:34.159 --> 14:36.039
-I didn't want anyone to
talk me out of it.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.279
-Well then, brace yourself,
pumpkin, because it is lunacy

14:38.320 --> 14:39.799
to even think about dancing.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.720
Tara, what if you
make it worse?

14:41.759 --> 14:43.080
-And what if I don't
dance, and it

14:43.120 --> 14:45.679
still doesn't get better?

14:45.720 --> 14:47.720
This could be my last chance
to perform on stage.

14:54.159 --> 14:57.600
-This is not the day
to be pessimistic.

14:57.639 --> 15:00.279
I am coming back
to the Academy.

15:00.320 --> 15:03.279
You're going to have a bit of
couch time with Sir Joshua and

15:03.320 --> 15:05.399
those movies that you
like about horses.

15:05.440 --> 15:09.080
And then, it's going to be
you and me, all the time.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.519
Just like it was before.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.519
[classical musical playing]

15:54.120 --> 15:56.000
-Thank you, Mr. Reed.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.639
[applause]

15:57.679 --> 16:01.759
-How do you feel about
fuchsia chalk?

STEVEN (OFFSCREEN): Introducing
Benjamin Tickle--

16:06.360 --> 16:06.799
-Here.

16:06.840 --> 16:07.759
Hold these.

16:07.799 --> 16:09.279
Watch how the grown ups do it.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.679
STEVEN (OFFSCREEN): --dancing

[classical music playing]

16:23.679 --> 16:24.559
-Skinny Reed to Big Ben.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.120
Careful on your rondo.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.080
Hold my feet.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.440
That was a deduction.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.840
-OK.

16:39.879 --> 16:41.000
You're going to have to dig
deep on those pique turns.

16:41.039 --> 16:42.519
-I wasn't planning
on coasting.

16:42.559 --> 16:44.159
-In the posing and attitudes,
focus on your upper body, OK?

16:44.200 --> 16:45.360
Because Tara's expressing.

16:49.039 --> 16:50.200
There's no point doing this
if you're not going to

16:50.240 --> 16:52.559
be better than her.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.440
-[scoffs].

16:54.480 --> 16:58.000
All semester, you've being
entertainingly vocal about how

16:58.039 --> 16:59.720
crap she is at this solo.

16:59.759 --> 17:01.759
And--

17:01.799 --> 17:03.679
I know why you hate
her so much.

17:03.720 --> 17:04.680
-I don't.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.358
I've got the Academy
to think about.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.640
-Please.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.759
I've been there with
Tara jealousy.

17:09.799 --> 17:12.559
-I'm the youngest principal in
the history of the company.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.559
I'm not jealous of anyone.

17:15.598 --> 17:16.960
-I knew she was good.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.559
I just never thought she was
good enough to scare you.

17:19.598 --> 17:20.759
-Excuse me.

17:28.118 --> 17:30.079
[classical music playing]

17:38.039 --> 17:40.440
-So you're giving presents
to Kat under the radar.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.640
What's that about?

17:42.680 --> 17:44.039
-Nothing.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.559
I just didn't want to make a
thing about it, you know?

17:53.160 --> 17:56.440
-You know, Tara and I
broke up months ago.

17:56.480 --> 17:57.759
-You did not just say that.

17:57.799 --> 17:59.319
[classical music playing]

18:11.160 --> 18:13.519
-Hey.

18:13.559 --> 18:14.720
-You didn't leave.

18:14.759 --> 18:16.200
-Yeah, I was banking
on the socks that

18:16.240 --> 18:17.279
you'd change your mind.

18:17.319 --> 18:20.559
And judging from the costume--

18:20.599 --> 18:23.160
STEVEN (OFFSCREEN): That
completes the boys' section.

18:23.200 --> 18:26.119
Ladies with surnames beginning
A to E, please make your way

18:26.160 --> 18:27.400
to the stage.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.359
-So I have a question, dancer
to choreographer.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.559
-Go for it.

18:40.799 --> 18:43.559
-I was just wondering if this
was strictly professional

18:43.599 --> 18:45.440
relationship between us.

18:45.480 --> 18:48.440
-Introducing Abigail Armstrong,
dancing an original

18:48.480 --> 18:50.519
piece by Ethan Karamakov.

18:50.559 --> 18:51.519
Representing the National
Academy.

18:51.559 --> 18:52.720
-Did that clear it up for you?

18:55.079 --> 18:56.240
-Totally professional.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.359
[classical music playing]

19:32.720 --> 19:35.599
-I couldn't decide between
the turtle or the dugong.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.559
-You know how I said we
can't be friends?

19:37.599 --> 19:38.680
-Yes.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.079
-Cute, thoughtful presents
contravene that.

19:42.119 --> 19:43.319
-I'll take it back, then.

19:43.359 --> 19:44.200
It's no big deal.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.400
-OK.

19:47.799 --> 19:49.759
-Oh, no.

19:49.799 --> 19:51.200
-Give him back to me.

19:51.240 --> 19:52.759
Give him back to me.

19:52.799 --> 19:54.119
Please.

19:57.359 --> 19:58.559
You're breaking the
rules, dude.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.319
-I'm telling the judges
I'm pulling out.

20:06.359 --> 20:07.559
-Why?

20:07.599 --> 20:08.440
-No.

20:08.480 --> 20:09.680
You need a second opinion.

20:12.599 --> 20:13.799
KAT (ON TALKIE): I get it.

20:13.839 --> 20:14.960
You want to take have your
cake and eat it too.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.720
I like cake.

20:16.759 --> 20:17.640
-Is that Kat?

20:17.680 --> 20:19.960
-She must be with Christian.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.960
KAT (ON TALKIE): And it's
awesome for a guy to have a

20:22.000 --> 20:24.319
girl that has a crush
on you around.

20:24.359 --> 20:27.240
But you also don't want
to cut off all your

20:27.279 --> 20:28.640
options with Tara either.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.160
-Are you done?

20:31.200 --> 20:34.440
This thing, it isn't
one-sided.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.119
-No. -Leave it.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.680
CHRISTIAN (ON TALKIE): When I
kissed you, that's something I

20:37.720 --> 20:41.319
wanted to do for a long time.

20:41.359 --> 20:43.240
-T, you can't listen to that.

20:49.559 --> 20:51.480
-You knew about this, and
you didn't tell me.

20:51.519 --> 20:52.720
-No, it was only
a gut feeling.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.400
T, where are you going?

21:07.319 --> 21:08.519
-Samuel, talk me through how
we're celebrating tonight.

21:25.559 --> 21:29.000
-T, I swear I told him nothing
was ever going to happen

21:29.039 --> 21:31.079
between us.

21:31.119 --> 21:32.240
-But you want it to?

21:35.279 --> 21:38.720
-Please don't dance.

21:38.759 --> 21:41.119
Tara, you being OK
is so much more

21:41.160 --> 21:43.319
important than any of this.

21:43.359 --> 21:45.720
-You say that, but it feels like
you're the one who just

21:45.759 --> 21:47.119
stabbed me in the back.

21:50.160 --> 21:54.400
-Introducing Tara Webster,
dancing "The Red Shoes,"

21:54.440 --> 21:56.079
representing The National
Academy.

22:01.319 --> 22:02.599
TARA (NARRATING): There have
been a few times that when I'm

22:02.640 --> 22:04.279
dancing, I forget
that I'm human.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.240
My feet could be bleeding right
through my pointe shoes,

22:11.279 --> 22:12.440
and I don't even notice.

22:17.039 --> 22:19.000
This wasn't like that.

22:30.160 --> 22:33.119
The anesthetic must have warn
off, because I could feel

22:33.160 --> 22:34.160
everything.

22:34.200 --> 22:38.079
And dancing wasn't
making it better.

22:38.119 --> 22:39.319
It was making it worse.

22:43.119 --> 22:45.440
-Thank you, Tara.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.079
Unfortunately, it doesn't change
the fact that you lied

22:48.119 --> 22:50.200
about your injury.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.279
You were aware you were breaking
the rules when you

22:52.319 --> 22:54.400
went to an outside doctor,
and you did it anyway.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.079
I have no choice but to expel
you from the Academy.

23:02.119 --> 23:03.119
-Tara made a mistake.

23:03.160 --> 23:04.240
She's apologized.

23:04.279 --> 23:05.960
-Mr. Webster, our rules
are to protect the

23:06.000 --> 23:07.480
health and safety students.

23:07.519 --> 23:09.359
-My daughter never would have
lied in the first place if the

23:09.400 --> 23:10.599
school hadn't so
much pressure--

23:10.640 --> 23:12.559
-Stop.

23:12.599 --> 23:15.480
It's my fault, not
the Academy's.

23:15.519 --> 23:16.759
-Sweetheart.

23:16.799 --> 23:18.160
-I just want to go home.
