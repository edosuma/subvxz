00:01.702 --> 00:03.268
[Willie humming]

00:03.270 --> 00:05.337
Willie, big news!

00:05.339 --> 00:07.673
The ALFer's won a contest.

00:07.675 --> 00:08.841
Yeah?

00:08.843 --> 00:10.275
Oh, let's see.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.814
You won a copy
of "Cat Lover's Monthly?"

00:15.816 --> 00:19.184
Kind of a letdown.
No recipes.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.653
[chuckles]
How did you win this?

00:21.655 --> 00:25.024
Well, I entered that publisher's
sweepstakes thing.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.892
I licked all those
magazine stamps

00:26.894 --> 00:30.062
and...stuck 'em on my entry.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.363
You sent in..

00:31.365 --> 00:34.400
...all those stamps?

00:34.402 --> 00:36.368
Well, all except Redbook.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.604
It's still stuck
to the roof of my mouth.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.242
Just, uh, how many magazines

00:43.244 --> 00:44.877
did you win?

00:44.879 --> 00:46.445
Check the front porch.

00:48.983 --> 00:50.382
[sighs]

00:52.186 --> 00:53.619
Oops.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.388
ALF..

00:56.390 --> 00:59.024
...you didn't win
any sweepstakes.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.559
You-you've subscribed

01:00.561 --> 01:02.961
to hundreds of magazines!

01:04.065 --> 01:05.531
That explains this personal

01:05.533 --> 01:07.900
thank-you note from Ed McMahon.

01:11.038 --> 01:13.906
[theme music]

01:40.301 --> 01:42.334
[music continues]

02:13.434 --> 02:15.033
Well, here's your cappuccino.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.137
Where's the grated cheese?

02:18.139 --> 02:19.738
I'll get it.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.142
(ALF)
Willie, Kate.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.144
I have something to tell you.

02:25.146 --> 02:27.279
This time the ol' ALFer's

02:27.281 --> 02:28.780
really won something.

02:28.782 --> 02:29.648
What now?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.783
Eleven records for a penny?

02:31.785 --> 02:33.185
No!

02:33.187 --> 02:34.486
This time the ALFer's won

02:34.488 --> 02:36.622
stuff for everybody.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.924
Pony rides for Brian.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.826
Tennis lessons for Lynn.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.328
Dinner and dancing
for you two.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.030
And best of all

02:45.032 --> 02:46.465
for the old ALFer..

02:46.467 --> 02:48.433
...a toaster.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.505
I guess you didn't hear me.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.841
A toaster!

02:55.843 --> 02:57.643
We heard you.

02:57.645 --> 03:00.646
Did I mention
that the toaster talks?

03:00.648 --> 03:03.682
Oh, ALF, this-this
is just a real estate promotion.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.517
A free toaster for listening to
a sales pitch

03:05.519 --> 03:07.586
about vacation homes.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.023
You mean no pony rides?

03:11.025 --> 03:12.658
There may be a pony ride

03:12.660 --> 03:15.394
but there's also
a seven-hour car ride

03:15.396 --> 03:17.196
to get to this place.

03:17.198 --> 03:19.364
I'm not driving seven hours.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.033
Sorry, ALF.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.001
ALFer.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.236
ALFer.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.571
[doorbell rings]

03:28.209 --> 03:30.108
They lied to a child?

03:33.847 --> 03:35.380
- Hi, neighbor.
- Oh, hi.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.882
Got you a present.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.320
Thanks. Won't you come in?

03:41.322 --> 03:44.756
Uh, I noticed your garbage cans
have been flowing over.

03:44.758 --> 03:49.027
Oh, yeah, we've been throwing
out a lot of magazines lately.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.362
Yeah.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.697
These insert things

03:51.699 --> 03:54.066
were all over
your porch and lawn.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.034
I kept the perfume samples.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.003
Wife's birthday is
next week.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.073
She'll be touched.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.407
As am I.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.343
Hey..

04:04.345 --> 04:06.445
You got a letter
from Rancho Estates too?

04:06.447 --> 04:09.081
Oh, yeah,
the toaster people.

04:09.083 --> 04:13.085
[chuckles]
Yeah. Raquel and me, we go
to these things all the time.

04:14.188 --> 04:16.455
Hey...you wanna go together?

04:16.457 --> 04:20.292
Together? No.
No, we're not interested.

04:20.294 --> 04:21.627
Oh, because of me?

04:21.629 --> 04:23.462
No. No, I didn't mean that.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.397
Uh, we'd-we'd love to spend

04:25.399 --> 04:27.866
a weekend with you folk, but..

04:27.868 --> 04:30.869
...uh, we're not interested
in a seven-hour drive.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.638
Well, you can fly
there in one hour.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.940
Yeah, sure,
but who could afford it?

04:34.942 --> 04:37.075
I'll fly you
there for nothing.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.678
My friend lets me borrow
his plane on weekends.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.114
You're a pilot?

04:42.116 --> 04:44.216
Yeah. I flew in Korea.

04:44.218 --> 04:47.819
Over Inchon, I took some
commie flak in my ribs.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.554
You wanna see the scar?

04:49.556 --> 04:50.656
No. No. Please--

04:50.658 --> 04:53.091
Oh, how ya doing, Kate?

04:53.093 --> 04:54.660
Trevor.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.629
Then it's settled.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.431
See you Friday night
after work..

04:59.433 --> 05:01.633
...at the airport.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.969
What's settled?
W-what airport?

05:03.971 --> 05:06.672
Oh, thanks again
for the garbage can, Trevor.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.140
What garbage can?

05:10.110 --> 05:13.345
This garbage can,
and Trevor wants to fly us

05:13.347 --> 05:15.247
to Rancho Estates.

05:15.249 --> 05:17.215
Way to go, mister-o!

05:18.619 --> 05:20.152
We don't have
to see Mr. Ochmonek

05:20.154 --> 05:22.321
in a bathing suit, do we?

05:22.323 --> 05:24.589
No, because we're not going.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.124
Why?

05:26.126 --> 05:27.092
It'll be fun.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.161
What, a weekend
with the Ochmoneks?

05:29.163 --> 05:30.829
Well, you know,
it-it's not as if we have

05:30.831 --> 05:32.497
to share the same bathroom.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.499
- Do we?
- No.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.168
Let's go anyway.

05:37.338 --> 05:41.006
Even if you could get me
in a plane with Trevor..

05:41.008 --> 05:44.309
...we still have the problem
of leaving ALF all alone.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.778
Well now, maybe that's not
that big a problem.

05:46.780 --> 05:50.549
ALF has gone six months
without starting a fire.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.017
Right, dad.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.118
Please?

05:54.488 --> 05:56.221
Gee, a vacation
would be nice.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.023
Yeah.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.324
Okay, let's go.

05:59.326 --> 06:01.960
Oh, great!

06:01.962 --> 06:03.261
I'm ready.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.368
Uh-oh.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.636
Am I going alone?

06:11.638 --> 06:14.206
No, ALF, we're going..

06:14.208 --> 06:15.707
...alone.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.642
Come on, Brian.

06:17.644 --> 06:20.312
Which-which means
we trust you, ALF

06:20.314 --> 06:23.081
to stay by yourself.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.717
I don't wanna be trusted.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.552
I wanna go.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.955
That letter was sent to me.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.024
ALF, I'm-I'm very sorry

06:33.026 --> 06:35.160
that we can't take you,
but we can't.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.896
I promise we'll bring back
that talking blender.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.598
Toaster!

06:39.600 --> 06:41.900
The thing you put bread into.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.703
A blender you put cats into.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.438
See, I need to go
and teach you

06:46.440 --> 06:48.673
about small appliances.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.777
No, it's settled, ALF.

06:51.779 --> 06:54.880
We're going and you're staying.

06:54.882 --> 06:59.050
Oh, fine. I'll stay here
and talk to our old toaster.

06:59.052 --> 07:02.387
Of course, it won't talk back.

07:02.389 --> 07:07.692
Yeah. Gonna be a long quiet
weekend for the old ALFer.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.895
Don't feel guilty!

07:09.897 --> 07:12.030
I don't feel guilty.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.332
Then you haven't been
paying attention.

07:32.386 --> 07:34.686
[indistinct singing]

07:36.623 --> 07:38.924
This is
Captain Ochmonek speaking.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.892
For those with cameras..

07:40.894 --> 07:43.495
...on your left is
the Tujunga toxic waste dump.

07:43.497 --> 07:46.097
I'll fly in lower
so you can get a better view.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.300
No, don't. We can see it
fine from here.

07:49.770 --> 07:53.505
Boy, I sure get a kick out of
flying passengers for a change

07:53.507 --> 07:55.907
instead of just cargo.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.743
Where's that smell
coming from?

07:58.745 --> 08:01.480
From the cargo hold
where the pigs are.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.981
Oh, daddy, I feel so sick.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.616
I mean, why do we have to fly

08:04.618 --> 08:06.384
facing backwards anyway?

08:07.754 --> 08:10.856
I guess so we can keep
our eye on the pigs.

[instrumental music]

08:24.671 --> 08:26.204
There you go.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.608
Willie, this place
is really nice.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.878
- I'm kinda surprised.
- Me, too. The hotel is great.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.847
I keep looking for the catch.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.849
Oh, hello, you must
be the Tanners.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.284
I'm Bill Loman

08:39.286 --> 08:41.319

for Rancho Estates.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.554
I was expecting you.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.689
Oh, no, Mr. Tanner,
I think you were expecting

08:44.691 --> 08:46.224
the hard sell.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.692
Well, there's no need
to worry about that.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.160
Good.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.129
Because after you've seen
this slide show

08:51.131 --> 08:54.032
you are going to be begging me
to sell you a home.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.534

09:01.208 --> 09:04.142
Uh, would it be okay
if we looked at this later?

09:05.312 --> 09:08.380
- Uh, when later?
- Much later.

09:08.382 --> 09:11.983
[chuckles]
Oh. Absolutely, no problem.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.752
You know, you folks should
first enjoy some tennis

09:13.754 --> 09:15.587
some swimming
and some fishing.

09:15.589 --> 09:16.888
And if you need me

09:16.890 --> 09:19.157
I'll be following you
in a golf cart.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.564
[chuckles]
You know, we expected
a sales pitch.

09:25.566 --> 09:26.731
Yeah.

09:26.733 --> 09:27.899
That's no reason why we still

09:27.901 --> 09:29.768
can't enjoy ourselves.

09:29.770 --> 09:30.936
ALF!

09:34.408 --> 09:36.074
[instrumental music]

09:42.082 --> 09:43.848
Let's clear this up.

09:43.850 --> 09:46.251
Are you, or are you not

09:46.253 --> 09:47.619
happy to see me?

09:47.621 --> 09:49.554
I'm happy, ALF.

09:49.556 --> 09:50.956
Are those chocolates?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.291
How did you get here?

09:53.293 --> 09:54.759
I stowed away..

09:54.761 --> 09:56.361
...in Kate's suitcase.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.562
Oh, no.

09:57.564 --> 10:00.031
Now I'll have your hair
all over my clothes.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.766
Take it easy.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.768
Your clothes are hair free

10:03.770 --> 10:06.171
and hanging neatly
in the closet back home.

10:07.374 --> 10:10.208
What am I supposed
to wear here?

10:10.210 --> 10:12.944
Well, I love
what you've got on now.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.980
Perfect for every occasion.

10:16.883 --> 10:20.285
ALF, we trusted you
to stay out of trouble.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.954
I trusted you
to get my toaster.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.889
But I don't see it anywhere.

10:24.891 --> 10:26.358
Let alone, hear it.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.963
But the fact is,
I felt neglected.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.332
I'm a member of this
family too, you know.

10:35.969 --> 10:39.604
I just wanted to be
with the people I love.

10:39.606 --> 10:41.806
And get that toaster.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.141

10:45.112 --> 10:47.278
'We have adjoining rooms.'

10:47.280 --> 10:48.647
'Hey, open up!'

10:48.649 --> 10:50.415
Can't we shake this guy?

10:50.417 --> 10:53.018
Uh, Brian, quick, you better
hide ALF in the bedroom.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.853
Alright, but don't start

10:54.855 --> 10:57.355
that slide show without me.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.333
Looks like
we're neighbors again.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.001
You wanna go catch
the foreshow?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.337
Actually we were just
thinking about..

11:12.339 --> 11:14.339
...going home.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.341
What do you think? Will that be
out of the question?

11:17.844 --> 11:20.712
- He's joking, right?
- No.

11:20.714 --> 11:24.349
The plane ride was such fun
we can't wait to fly again.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.652
And I've got school tomorrow.

11:27.654 --> 11:28.920
On Saturday?

11:29.990 --> 11:31.856
Traffic school.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.391
Well, I'm sorry.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.561
That plane is on its way
to Central America.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.263
I can't tell you anything else.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.199
Are you saying we're stuck here?

11:41.201 --> 11:44.135
Yeah.
Tough luck, eh?

11:44.137 --> 11:47.038
Stuck in a resort hotel.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.207
Come on, let's cut a rug.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.543
Trip the light fantastic!

11:51.545 --> 11:53.078
Do the hustle.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.382
Oh, I'd love to, but..

11:57.384 --> 12:00.151
I don't have anything to wear.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.487
Well, what was
in that suitcase of yours?

12:02.489 --> 12:04.089
It weighed a ton.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.892
Sun tan lotion, uh..

12:07.894 --> 12:09.994
Mom tends to burn.

12:09.996 --> 12:11.896
Oh, don't worry about it.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.432
Raquel will lend you
one of her dresses.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.240
Now don't spill anything
on Raquel's dress.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.109
I might wanna wear it next.

12:25.011 --> 12:27.178
[instrumental music]

12:33.720 --> 12:35.153
[sighs]

12:37.891 --> 12:40.225
[door closes]

12:40.227 --> 12:42.794
Dad, what are you doing
up so early?

12:42.796 --> 12:45.597
I'm sorry. Um, I..

12:45.599 --> 12:47.932
I never got to sleep.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.234
I spent the whole night
listening

12:49.236 --> 12:52.570
to the Ochmoneks snore.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.806
They both snore?

12:54.808 --> 12:56.274
In a pattern.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.477
Like a conversation.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.614
- Didn't you hear it?
- Yeah.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.283
But I just thought
it was the ice machine.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.953
ALF?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.121
Where's ALF?

13:10.123 --> 13:11.756
I thought
he was in with you.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.124
Kate!

13:13.126 --> 13:14.726
What's wrong?

13:14.728 --> 13:16.161
I can't find ALF.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.365
I'm right here.

13:21.902 --> 13:25.136
Willie, what's wrong?

13:25.138 --> 13:28.139
- Where were you?
- Out catching catfish.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.641
Somebody could
have seen you.

13:29.643 --> 13:30.809
No way!

13:30.811 --> 13:33.778
This place is a morgue
before dawn.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.180
I wanted to surprise
you guys

13:35.182 --> 13:37.582
by serving catfish
in bed.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.285
[knocking on door]

13:40.287 --> 13:43.021
(Trevor)
'Hey, Tanner,
rise and shine.'

13:43.023 --> 13:44.689
- Bedroom.
- Bathroom.

13:44.691 --> 13:47.392
Gotta clean the fish.
Come on, B.

13:50.664 --> 13:53.631
- Oh, morning, Trevor.
- Good, you're already up.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.799
(ALF)
'Hey, we've got a bidet!'

13:58.839 --> 14:02.273
It's Brian. In the morning
his voice is a lot lower.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.842
[electric shaver whirring]

14:03.844 --> 14:05.476
Sounds like he's shaving.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.346
Oh, yeah.
Uh, yeah.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.248
I won't allow him
to have a mustache.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.851
That's good.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.019
You got to take a stand.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.322
Listen,
since we're up already

14:17.324 --> 14:19.691
why not go
for a pony ride?

14:19.693 --> 14:21.125
No, thanks, Trevor.

14:21.127 --> 14:23.995
We-we're just
gonna stay here.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.363
Yes, it's such
a great room

14:25.365 --> 14:27.198
we don't want
to waste it..

14:27.200 --> 14:29.200
...by going out.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.535
But you gotta go out.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.071
You gotta go
to the big sales presentation.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.139
It's mandatory
for everybody.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.710
- All of us?
- Away from this room?

14:38.712 --> 14:39.811
At the same time?

14:41.548 --> 14:44.249
Yeah, what the heck,
get crazy.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.684
Listen, the buffet
starts at 7 o'clock.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.454
Raquel will have your dress
picked out by 6:30.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.092
Well, by the way,
she wanted to know

14:54.094 --> 14:56.261
did you need a bra with that?

14:57.230 --> 14:59.397
Just the dress.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.237
ALF, he's gone.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.107
(Brian)
'He's busy
scaling catfish.'

15:09.109 --> 15:11.609
Catfish don't have scales.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.612
Then I won't be needing
your shaver anymore.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.849
Neither will I.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.260
Nice dress, mom.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.297
Yeah, Kate, you look
real sexy in that.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.666
Well, anyone would
look good in this.

15:36.870 --> 15:38.369
- Trevor.
- Hmm.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.605
You know you're not supposed
to be eating shellfish.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.607
You'll have
an allergic reaction.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.309
It's lot safer
than the Mexican food

15:44.311 --> 15:46.878
Tanner's eating.
Huh, Tanner?

15:46.880 --> 15:48.980
What? Oh!

15:48.982 --> 15:51.416
I-I'm sorry I was,
I was worrying about

15:51.418 --> 15:53.418
whether our room..

15:53.420 --> 15:55.620
...would be alright..

15:55.622 --> 15:57.355
...all alone.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.659
Our room will be fine, dad.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.395
It has a toaster
to keep it company.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.969
(automated message)
'Toast.'

16:10.971 --> 16:13.104
Hah! Hah!

16:13.106 --> 16:14.639
'Toast.'

16:15.475 --> 16:16.708
'Toast.'

16:17.744 --> 16:19.577
'Toast down.'

16:23.183 --> 16:25.149
Hello, room service?

16:25.151 --> 16:29.253
Send another bag
of bread to room 13.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.689
Yeah, leave it outside
the door again.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.792
- 'Toasting.'
- Quiet. I'm on the phone.

16:34.794 --> 16:38.496
Oh, hey, and bring
some tartar sauce.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.798
Thanks.

16:40.800 --> 16:44.035
Now, let's see
what you can do with catfish.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.670
Oh!

16:47.007 --> 16:49.941
You know your daughter
is a terrific tennis player.

16:49.943 --> 16:51.609
[chuckles]

16:51.611 --> 16:54.145
You know, honey, if you lived up
here, you could play every day.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.014
[chuckles]
Yeah.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.181
Oh, why don't you
tell your dad

16:57.183 --> 16:58.649
how much
you'd like to live here.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.485
- No.
- Oh, go on, tell him.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.986
- No.
- Tell him!

17:01.988 --> 17:03.354
- No!
- Mr. Loman--

17:03.356 --> 17:04.789
Alright, settle down, folks.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.290
We'll begin
the sales presentation

17:06.292 --> 17:08.192
in just a minute.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.194
That's why
we're here, right?

17:10.196 --> 17:12.864
[laughs]

17:12.866 --> 17:14.532
Of course,
there are some people

17:14.534 --> 17:17.602
who keep coming back
for the free room and shellfish.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.907
Last chance for seconds.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.877
Trevor, you said you were only
going back for salad.

17:25.879 --> 17:28.279
I did. It's underneath
the shrimp.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.049
Hey, Tanner!

17:31.051 --> 17:32.283
You didn't eat a thing.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.286
You still worried
about your room?

17:36.256 --> 17:37.622
No.

17:42.328 --> 17:43.761
Willie, was that..

17:46.366 --> 17:47.799
Yes, it was!

17:50.737 --> 17:52.737
Oh!

17:52.739 --> 17:55.339
I warned him
about that Mexican food.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.810
[instrumental music]

18:02.849 --> 18:04.182
I tell you, Tanner

18:04.184 --> 18:07.518
I thought only rock stars
got kicked out of hotels.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.953
Yeah, I can't imagine

18:08.955 --> 18:11.856
what caused that toaster
to short circuit.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.058
But I'm gonna find out.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.927
It sure stunk up
the place.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.629
It smelled of burned fish
all the way to the lobby.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.700
By the way

18:22.702 --> 18:24.969
how's that smell back
in the cargo section?

18:26.773 --> 18:29.607
I, for one,
miss the pigs.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.677
I'm sorry, I meant
to hose down the jackals.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.546
Hey, Raquel!

18:35.548 --> 18:39.250
I feel a little woozy.
Uh, get me a bromo, will ya?

18:39.252 --> 18:41.552
I warned you
about that shellfish, Trevor.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.488
Just get it, alright?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.656
I'll get it in a second.

18:45.658 --> 18:49.227
I have to put ointment
on my shoulders.

18:49.229 --> 18:52.363
That hotel ought to warn
their guests about the sun.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.306
Quite possibly
the worst weekend

19:02.308 --> 19:05.343
of our entire lives.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.078
You haven't
stopped complaining

19:07.080 --> 19:09.380
since I burned
down that room.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.452
You, back with the jackals!

19:14.454 --> 19:15.987
They're hyenas

19:15.989 --> 19:17.788
and I don't like them.

19:17.790 --> 19:18.823
They're jackals.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.559
Then why are they
laughing at me?

19:24.164 --> 19:25.563
[sighs]

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Lieutenant McIntosh

19:29.002 --> 19:30.701
give me the coordinates.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.271
We're almost over
enemy territory.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.206
Oh! What enemy territory?

19:35.208 --> 19:36.874
What enemy territory?

19:36.876 --> 19:39.710
What do you think that is,
the Mississippi River?

19:39.712 --> 19:41.746
Those are
the Bridges of Toko-Ri.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.048
Trevor!

19:45.218 --> 19:46.851
- Trevor!
- Huh?

19:46.853 --> 19:49.654
Snap out of it, Trevor,
the war is over.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.856
Boy, I did overdo
the shellfish.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.724
Willie, Willie,
what-what's wrong?

19:53.726 --> 19:57.628
I'm not sure. Trevor,
how serious is this allergy?

19:57.630 --> 20:01.899
It's nothing. Listen, would you
switch on the auto pilot?

20:01.901 --> 20:04.468
- Where is it?
- It's right down there.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.139
Thanks.

20:08.141 --> 20:10.007
I'm gonna get up

20:10.009 --> 20:11.475
and move around a little

20:11.477 --> 20:14.178
stretch for a minute..

20:14.180 --> 20:16.547
...so I don't pass out.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.883
- Ah!
- Oh!

20:18.885 --> 20:22.220
- Trevor!
- Oh! Trevor. Trevor!

20:22.222 --> 20:24.355
Trevor, say something.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.490
Oh, good, the USO.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.893
- Is he okay?
- My gosh!

20:28.895 --> 20:31.395
What are we gonna do?
Who's going to fly the plane?

20:31.397 --> 20:34.232
- Dad, you fly it.
- Now, relax everybody.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.235
Nobody is gonna
fly this plane.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.970
Ah, dad!

20:40.573 --> 20:42.673
- I'll fly it.
- You..

20:42.675 --> 20:44.542
We have an emergency!

20:44.544 --> 20:46.744
I'm the logical choice.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.446
Oh, by the way,
you were right.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.081
They are not hyenas.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.682
But they are laughing.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.420
ALF can fly a plane?

20:56.422 --> 20:58.923
Oh, he can't even
work the toaster.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.360
Well, he did
fly a spaceship.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.862
Yeah, how different
can it be?

21:06.966 --> 21:08.566
What does this do?

21:08.568 --> 21:10.167
[engine roars]

21:12.071 --> 21:14.138
I see.

21:14.140 --> 21:17.275
(Raquel)
'Trevor, stop fooling around.'

21:17.277 --> 21:19.143
Oh, my gosh. Raquel!

21:20.813 --> 21:24.148
(Raquel)
'This door is stuck,
somebody help me.'

21:24.150 --> 21:27.118
Oh, oh, oh, she'll see ALF.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.153
Help me block the door.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.621
Help is on the way, Raquel.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.490
Brian, sit down,
fasten your seat belt.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.792
(Raquel)
'What's blocking the door?'

21:34.794 --> 21:36.093
Um..

21:36.095 --> 21:37.762
...a hyena.

21:37.764 --> 21:40.898
Well, did he figure it out?
Can you fly it?

21:40.900 --> 21:44.168
I think so. I need to see
an owner's manual.

21:44.170 --> 21:47.605
Oh, there's not
an owner's manual.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.640
- Then I can't fly it.
- Oh!

21:49.642 --> 21:51.642
ALF, the laws of aerodynamics

21:51.644 --> 21:54.445
are the same everywhere
in the universe.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.547
Yeah, that's right.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.250
What are they?

22:00.787 --> 22:03.154
We're headed straight
for that mountain, ALF!

22:03.156 --> 22:05.256
ALF, do something! Quick!

22:05.258 --> 22:06.490
Alright, alright!

22:06.492 --> 22:08.326
Easy. Easy.

22:08.328 --> 22:11.028
Up, up, up

22:11.030 --> 22:13.331
and over.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.632
Yeah!

22:14.634 --> 22:17.335
- This flying's a piece of cake.
- Oh!

22:17.337 --> 22:20.705
Oh, a piece of cake?
That was a piece of luck.

22:20.707 --> 22:24.508
Luck? Ha!
Check this out.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.477
Oops!

22:26.479 --> 22:28.012
¶ Come fly with me ¶

I gotta hand it to you, Tanner.

22:38.358 --> 22:41.459
You did a great job
bringing in that plane.

22:41.461 --> 22:42.660
But the next time

22:42.662 --> 22:44.362
you might mention
to the airport

22:44.364 --> 22:46.063
that you plan to land.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.967
I'll keep that in mind.

22:49.969 --> 22:52.203
Thank you so much
for the dress.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.872
I don't know what I would
have done without it.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.374
What a lovely weekend.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.075
We must do it
again, sometime.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.511
Okay, but only
if we get the jackals.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.279
[chuckles]

23:06.219 --> 23:09.954
Come on, baby.
Speak to the old ALFer.

23:12.358 --> 23:14.091
- Are they gone?
- Yes.

23:14.093 --> 23:17.828
Oh, good. Then we can pick
up where we left off.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.697
I believe you were
thanking me

23:19.699 --> 23:21.732
for saving your lives.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.735
No, I believe
we had already thanked you

23:24.737 --> 23:26.604
several times.

23:26.606 --> 23:29.073
Well, you can
thank me again.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.408
No.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.776
Please.

23:32.512 --> 23:35.880
Alright.
Thank you, ALF.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.516
We never could have
made it back without you.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.751
You're the best alien
that any family..

23:40.753 --> 23:42.720
(automated message)
'Toast up!'

23:42.722 --> 23:44.555
Hold that thought,
will you, Willie?

23:44.557 --> 23:46.657
My catfish are ready.
