WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.502
Well, this is the
last of Robby's stuff.

00:03.504 --> 00:05.137
How you doing with the breakup?
Really well,

00:05.139 --> 00:07.006
since we're related,

00:07.008 --> 00:10.109
and all the laws of nature say
we should not be together.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.343
If you guys
need me today,

00:11.345 --> 00:13.112
I'll be in my room
rearranging my furniture

00:13.114 --> 00:14.713
so it no longer resembles
a place

00:14.715 --> 00:15.814
where I made out with my cousin.

00:15.816 --> 00:16.715
(all groaning)

00:16.717 --> 00:17.683
Third cousin.

00:17.685 --> 00:18.617
Still.
Ugh,

00:18.619 --> 00:19.518
barely better.
Ew.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.786
Don't normalize it, Jess.
Ugh.

00:20.788 --> 00:21.520
You're right, you're right.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.488
(gags)
Ugh.

00:22.490 --> 00:25.024
Hey, Nick.
Are you wearing

00:25.026 --> 00:27.326
your running bottoms
and your hoodie?

00:27.328 --> 00:28.427
Nick, are you going running?

00:30.164 --> 00:31.096
Have fun.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.134
Oh, my God.
What is wrong with Nick, Reagan?

00:35.136 --> 00:36.201
Yeah, what happened?
Are you guys okay?

00:36.203 --> 00:38.003
Nick is going for a run.
(chuckles)

00:38.005 --> 00:40.706
If anything, we should be asking
what is right with Nick.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.007
He only goes running
if he's upset.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.042
And he's wearing his sad hoodie.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.376
And by the looks of it,
it's been washed,

00:44.378 --> 00:46.045
which is bone-chilling.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.179
He's fine. Everything's okay.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.715
I just passed Nick
on the street running,

00:49.717 --> 00:51.216
on purpose!

00:51.218 --> 00:52.584
Oh, my God!

00:52.586 --> 00:54.053
Maybe I was wrong.

00:54.055 --> 00:55.020
Nick!

00:55.022 --> 00:56.021
Are you okay?!

00:56.023 --> 00:57.222
I see you!

00:57.224 --> 00:59.358
And I love you!

00:59.360 --> 01:02.694
In my defense, no one here
emotes in a normal way.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.163
That's fair.
Nick!

01:04.165 --> 01:06.231
♪ ♪

01:08.736 --> 01:10.602
How's the boba?

01:12.606 --> 01:14.406
It's fine.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.610
Why are you making
so much eye contact with us?

01:20.247 --> 01:23.015
Oh, you're gonna ask us
for something, aren't you?

01:23.017 --> 01:24.683
This boba is a metaphor.

01:24.685 --> 01:28.287
Aly is the tapioca pearl
to my milky matcha,

01:28.289 --> 01:32.024
each made better by the
unlikely presence of the other.

01:32.026 --> 01:33.725
I think you know
what I'm saying...

01:33.727 --> 01:35.761
We have absolutely no idea.
I haven't known
what you've been saying

01:35.763 --> 01:37.029
for three
and a half years.

01:37.031 --> 01:39.064
I'm asking Aly to marry me.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.100
What?!
Whoa!
Yeah,

01:41.102 --> 01:42.101
yeah. (chuckles)
Oh, my gosh!

01:42.103 --> 01:44.103
Winston. My man!
Yeah.

01:44.105 --> 01:46.105
Yes.
(chuckles)

01:46.107 --> 01:47.973
And I'm gonna need your
help with the process.

01:47.975 --> 01:51.110
Now, keep this between us.
I am only telling you two.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.478
Yeah, we won't say a word. Yeah.
Whatever you need.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.446
Meet me at the bar in one hour,
okay?

01:54.448 --> 01:56.315
Look fresh.

01:56.317 --> 01:59.451
We'll discuss details. I'm gonna
need you for the entire day.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.787
We're with you.
Yes. Little Winnie
is growing up.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.723
First he's a husband
and then maybe one day

02:04.725 --> 02:06.325
he could be a father...

02:06.327 --> 02:08.293
One day? (chuckles)
I am a father.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.596
It's a cat, Winston.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.097
He's my blood.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.732
I am never gonna
figure him out.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.602
I feel like I found
a forest baby,

02:16.604 --> 02:18.504
and I don't know when
it's hungry or in pain

02:18.506 --> 02:20.172
or afraid of the
kitchen light.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.007
I know. (chuckles)
Nick is just an enigma

02:22.009 --> 02:24.276
wrapped up in a bunch
of Chicago Bears crap.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.311
You need the help
of a seasoned vet.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.646
(knocking at door)
Come in!

02:27.648 --> 02:29.148
Hey, Nick.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.349
Hey.
You feeling upset

02:30.351 --> 02:31.650
about something?
No.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.319
I'm just eating edamame.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.162
Give me the cup.
(spits)

02:43.164 --> 02:45.197
They taste so bad.
That's what I thought.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.032
I submitted
<i> The Pepperwood Chronicles</i>

02:47.034 --> 02:49.368
to a publishing company, and I
got the rejection letter today.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.170
My career is over.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.338
No, it's not. Nick,
someday you'll be talking

02:53.340 --> 02:56.341
to a reanimated Oprah
about that book.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.177
Have you talked to Reagan
about this?

02:58.179 --> 03:00.012
I bet she'd be awesome
to talk to.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.680
No, I am too embarrassed.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.682
Nick, she's your girlfriend.
You have to let her in.

03:03.684 --> 03:06.385
Don't just keep her
in the perfect front room.

03:06.387 --> 03:09.021
Okay.
Let her in the back,
with the weird rooms

03:09.023 --> 03:11.390
and the-the dead bulbs
and the wet walls.

03:11.392 --> 03:14.026
All right, but I'm not
letting her go anywhere
near my crawl space.

03:14.028 --> 03:17.029
I don't think you should let
anyone near your crawl space.

03:17.031 --> 03:19.231
Well, some people have
to go to the crawl space
to clean out the boxes.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.366
Who cleans out the boxes?

03:21.368 --> 03:23.135
Significant other.

03:23.137 --> 03:24.703
What are you talking about?

03:24.705 --> 03:27.539
Hey. I have the scoop.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.975
Nick's book got rejected,
and he's really embarrassed.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.377
So now the baton...

03:32.379 --> 03:35.447
♪<i> Has been passed...</i> ♪

03:43.424 --> 03:44.590
...to you.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.225
You own an actual baton?

03:46.227 --> 03:47.593
It was Robby's.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.729
He was really into
competitive male twirling.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.065
I have so many questions...

03:53.067 --> 03:53.732
No.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.033
WINSTON:
<i> First, thank you</i>

03:55.035 --> 03:57.569
for coming to this
very special event.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.372
Might I just add that
everyone looks fresh.

04:00.374 --> 04:03.742
Now, when Aly gets here, I am
going to suggest an activity

04:03.744 --> 04:05.244
for the four of us to do.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.446
Then I'll
gracefully back out,

04:07.448 --> 04:11.450
leaving the two of you to
distract her as I prepare for...

04:11.452 --> 04:13.218
the show.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.087
(giggling)
Ooh, I got a scream
and nowhere to put it.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.521
Ooh, this is exciting.

04:16.523 --> 04:19.424
Now, at an undisclosed time,
I will place a call to Aly,

04:19.426 --> 04:23.195
informing her that my car
has broken down in Malibu,

04:23.197 --> 04:27.032
where I'll be waiting with
a beautiful and glorious picnic

04:27.034 --> 04:29.167
right next
to her favorite plant...

04:30.104 --> 04:31.637
...the common cactus.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.038
Here comes that scream.
Oh, my God,
Oh,

04:33.040 --> 04:34.973
there she is.
I'm screaming already. Aly!

04:34.975 --> 04:37.676
Hey. Hey, hey.
Hey. Hey, hey.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.979
Hi.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.381
(giggling)

04:42.383 --> 04:43.248
(chuckles)

04:43.250 --> 04:44.283
Strange energy, guys.

04:44.285 --> 04:46.318
(giggling continues)
We all had

04:46.320 --> 04:48.153
bubbly water. It made us giggle.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.155
What's up? What's up? What's up?
Hi. Hello.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.557
What's up?
Hi. Hello.

04:52.559 --> 04:54.493
Hello.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.295
Anyway, uh,
Schmidt and Cece asked us

04:56.297 --> 04:57.462
to help paint their house.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.097
Paint our house?
Paint the house.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.133
Remember? That's the activity
for all of us to do.

05:01.135 --> 05:03.101
You know, 'cause you
wanted... you wanted...
Paint the house.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.504
Paint the house.
Yes, we... did.

05:05.506 --> 05:09.308
Even though the majority
of our house is already painted.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.410
We wanted our best friends
to finish it.

05:11.412 --> 05:14.479
Not professionals.
Like, uh... like our new home

05:14.481 --> 05:17.082
was some tree house in
a Little League baseball movie.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.784
I mean, I-I've never done it
before, but...

05:18.786 --> 05:20.319
Sounds like a yes to me.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.620
Aw, snap, just
remembered,

05:21.622 --> 05:23.221
I can't make it.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.692
Uh, uh, boo.
Uh... (exhales)

05:26.694 --> 05:28.493
Yeah.
Boy, that's a bummer.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.662
Shock.
Shoot.
So fast.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.364
Ugh.
But, you know,

05:32.366 --> 05:34.232
boo.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.703
What up, boy in the hood?

05:37.705 --> 05:39.204
I thought you were
gonna talk to Reagan.

05:39.206 --> 05:41.206
I tried, but she's been
on her phone all day

05:41.208 --> 05:43.508
like a grandpa
who missed a package.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.978
Like... "Hel..."
I'm not even gonna do it.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.649
Yes. Thank you so much.
We will be there. Thanks.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.685
Nick, I know that dumb publisher
rejected your book.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.687
And, guess what,
that publisher can go to hell.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.689
After you beat them to death
with this baton

05:57.691 --> 05:59.191
that I weirdly still have.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.326
Because you don't need
a publisher.

06:01.328 --> 06:04.229
You need a girlfriend
who found a bookstore

06:04.231 --> 06:05.497
to sell<i> Pepperwood.</i>

06:05.499 --> 06:07.699
Seriously? That's amazing.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.369
That's amazing!
I called all over
and I finally found one.

06:10.371 --> 06:11.536
Reagan saved
the day!

06:11.538 --> 06:13.171
You're amazing.
That's right.

06:13.173 --> 06:14.673
All we need is, uh,

06:14.675 --> 06:16.308
30 copies of the book.
Oh, well, we can
make them.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.376
I mean, it'll be hard,

06:17.378 --> 06:18.410
but we could do it.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.145
We could do it.
We'll make 'em ourselves.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.913
Fantastic. Uh,
we just need 'em by tonight

06:21.915 --> 06:23.181
for his big reading.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.683
Excuse me, did you say "big..."

06:24.685 --> 06:26.318
a big reading tonight?

06:26.320 --> 06:27.386
Yeah.
Well, that

06:27.388 --> 06:29.688
sounds... public.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.189
Well, I mean, he's got
to do a reading

06:31.191 --> 06:32.224
to sell the book.
Is that bad?

06:32.226 --> 06:33.692
Is that bad? No, it's good.
I get...

06:33.694 --> 06:37.062
I<i> get</i> to do a reading
tonight in front of people.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.230
Yeah.
I get to read
in front

06:38.232 --> 06:40.232
of a bunch of people
who are gonna judge me.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.067
This is not bad. This is good.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.235
This is... (exhales)
JESS:
See, this is

06:43.237 --> 06:45.937
another thing that Nick does
when he's upset.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.339
At least he's not running.

06:47.341 --> 06:49.174
(clattering)

06:53.881 --> 06:57.349
So you want me to read in front
of people. You want me to read

06:57.351 --> 06:59.084
in front of living people...

06:59.086 --> 07:02.220
(voice squeaking):
...who are there
to hear me read.

07:02.222 --> 07:05.357
And how will I... how will
I even know what to read?

07:05.359 --> 07:07.859
You're gonna read your book.
I'll read my book. Fine.
This is good. I'm fine.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.695
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.
Oh, I feel like my heart

07:10.697 --> 07:13.398
is pumping out
scalding hot toilet water.
See,

07:13.400 --> 07:16.234
a vivid description like that is
gonna make the audience go wild.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.203
Ah, the audience!
I just forgot the audience,

07:18.205 --> 07:19.371
and now I remember the audience.

07:19.373 --> 07:21.640
I can't do this. I can't do it.
I can't do it.

07:21.641 --> 07:23.908
All right, here it is--
<i> The Pepperwood Chronicles.</i>

07:23.911 --> 07:25.577
I made a prototype.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.212
Jess, that looks fantastic!

07:27.214 --> 07:29.281
That looks really good.

07:29.283 --> 07:32.451
How did you do that?
Oh, that's between me
and my craft wagon.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.152
I wrote you.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.887
Hey, um, how's he doing?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.289
Not very good.
Hmm.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.757
And if I'm being
honest with you,

07:38.759 --> 07:40.425
I'm starting
to freak out now.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.127
This is me freaking out.

07:42.129 --> 07:45.630
Do I sometimes wonder
if you're a robot? Yeah.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.965
I've made you!

07:46.967 --> 07:48.900
You're of me.
JESS:
When Nick gets

07:48.902 --> 07:49.968
like this, he needs
to be occupied.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.137
Luckily, we have tons
of books to make.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.105

07:57.644 --> 08:01.346
Hey, Jess, can I borrow
your cactus gloves?

08:01.348 --> 08:02.347

08:10.023 --> 08:11.623
♪<i> It's in a book.</i> ♪

08:11.625 --> 08:12.657
Ah, you know the rest.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.326
Just, we put...
we put 'em there.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.994
Backing away from an
active craft project.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.429
Are you okay?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

08:17.431 --> 08:20.131
No. Um, Reagan's
a little insecure

08:20.133 --> 08:22.100
about being
there for Nick.
Oh.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.135
So I want her to have this.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.004
Wow. I'm proud of you.
Yeah.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.939
Thanks.
(both laugh)

08:27.941 --> 08:29.708
This is where
you give me the cactus gloves.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.844
This is really soothing.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.012
You're a natural.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.647
(whispering):
She's terrible.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.015
She's ruining our bedroom.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.984
It's like she's begrudgingly
covering up graffiti.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.685
Oh, there's a couple
rough patches,

08:40.687 --> 08:43.054
but...
that's what posters are for.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.023
Just calm down, okay?
We can fix it later,

08:45.025 --> 08:47.125
but we have to keep her
in here for Winston.
Hey.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.994
Since we're doing this,
I got to say,

08:48.996 --> 08:50.629
do not like the color
of your bathroom.

08:50.631 --> 08:54.032
You know what? Now that
I think about it, me, either.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.867
(quietly):
What?!
Let's do that next.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.069
Great.
It's special order
robin's egg.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.138
It's just paint!
It's not just paint.

09:00.140 --> 09:03.141
Guys, as much as I love
a good whisper fight,

09:03.143 --> 09:04.809
I should go.
CECE:
Oh, no!

09:04.811 --> 09:07.746
No, no, no, you,
uh, can not leave.
Why not?

09:07.748 --> 09:09.981
Because we can't
be alone together.

09:09.983 --> 09:13.818
Because...?
Because...

09:14.988 --> 09:17.322
Because...

09:17.324 --> 09:20.091
we're having
marital problems.

09:22.195 --> 09:25.063
That's... secret,

09:25.065 --> 09:27.032
which is part
of our marital problem.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.167
She's got a big mouth,
but a great can.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.670
Which is also part
of our marital problems.

09:31.672 --> 09:32.904
I objectify her.
ALY:
See,

09:32.906 --> 09:34.606
I knew something was up.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.041
Everyone was like,
"They're so perfect!"

09:36.043 --> 09:38.610
And I was like, "No.
Something in that relationship

09:38.612 --> 09:40.845
is very, very broken."

09:43.283 --> 09:45.750
Hey, Nick.
Where's Reagan?

09:45.752 --> 09:47.252
Getting more glue.
We ran out.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.020
How many did you get done?

09:49.022 --> 09:51.623
One... and I think
we did it wrong.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.592
It doesn't look right to me.

09:53.594 --> 09:56.428
Your reading's in
three hours! It...

09:56.430 --> 09:58.863
Let's make some books! I think
I have some really good glue

09:58.865 --> 10:00.532
in my non-mobile craft cart.

10:00.534 --> 10:01.866
You're gonna help me?
Yeah!

10:01.868 --> 10:03.668
Let's do it.
(both laugh)

10:06.039 --> 10:09.708
God, this glue works great!
Oh,

10:09.710 --> 10:11.109
it smells great, too!

10:11.111 --> 10:12.944
It really does.
(both sniffing)

10:15.582 --> 10:16.881
(sniffing)

10:18.085 --> 10:20.452
Oh, I love the
smell of new books!

10:20.454 --> 10:21.653
(sniffing)
(laughing):
Yeah, me, too.

10:21.655 --> 10:24.556
Mmm! New, new books.
<i> New,</i> new books!

10:24.558 --> 10:26.958
Oh! Can I tell you something?
I feel great right now.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.760
I feel very good.
I feel very confident.

10:28.762 --> 10:32.297
I am ready for that read.
I think you're gonna crush it.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.299
I think I'll read the whole book
in about two minutes.
Yeah. Just get in there.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.568
You'll... (sputtering gibberish)

10:36.570 --> 10:37.802
What?
What?

10:37.804 --> 10:39.771
What?
What?

10:39.773 --> 10:41.806
(sputtering gibberish)

10:41.808 --> 10:42.974
And people are gonna go nuts.
(sputtering gibberish)

10:42.976 --> 10:44.809
They're gonna be like, "Yes,
yes, we love this book."

10:44.811 --> 10:46.478
And they're gonna just buy
every copy,

10:46.480 --> 10:48.313
and then you're gonna have
to, like, print more.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.448
That's what's gonna happen.
Does your hair
always look like that?

10:50.450 --> 10:52.484
Yeah.
Do you have brown hair?

10:52.486 --> 10:55.820
Definitely.
Why didn't you tell me?

10:55.822 --> 10:57.589
It's a secret.
(both laughing)

10:57.591 --> 11:01.760
(cackling)

11:01.762 --> 11:02.927
Check this out.
I'm gonna birth this book.

11:02.929 --> 11:04.496
(laughing)
(groaning)

11:04.498 --> 11:06.331
Here you go.
It's a baby book.
Oh!

11:06.333 --> 11:07.699
(imitates baby crying)
Congratulations!

11:07.701 --> 11:09.834
It's a paperback!

11:09.836 --> 11:11.836
Hey, guys.
Reagan!
Reagan!

11:11.838 --> 11:13.838
Reagan.
<i> Reagan...!</i>

11:13.840 --> 11:16.808
(Reagan sighs,
Jess and Nick laugh)

11:16.810 --> 11:18.443
Sorry that took so long.
I got stuck behind

11:18.445 --> 11:19.811
this, uh,
lady at the craft store

11:19.813 --> 11:22.514
that was buying 700
individually-priced buttons.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.816
Mm.
Oh, they said
to say hi to you.

11:24.818 --> 11:27.018
Hi.
And I got you a new shirt, Nick.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.654
Oh, isn't that nice.
Phew! What the hell is
that smell, you guys?

11:29.656 --> 11:31.690
We made a library! Mm.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.658
Is this the glue?

11:33.660 --> 11:35.527
It comes from my
private collection.
Mm-hmm.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.462
It's very strong.
You guys are so high.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.897
How dare you.
How dare you.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.131
I'm not high at all.
You're high.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.535
Whoa!

11:43.537 --> 11:44.602
(clattering)

11:50.143 --> 11:53.011
You guys, this says to use this
in an open field.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.046
It specifically says that
a backyard is too small.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.716
You're a backyard.
Very good. (inhaling loudly)

11:57.718 --> 11:59.551
I think I should
cancel this reading.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.920
No way! I am in.
I feel great for the reading.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.689
Let me just buckle up my shirt.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.357
Well, the problem
with this author shirt

12:06.359 --> 12:07.892
is that it's made of honey.
It's not...

12:07.894 --> 12:09.861
This shirt is too sticky.
It's because there's
glue on your...

12:09.863 --> 12:12.097
'Cause it's made of honey, so...
And I'm canceling.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.898
You cannot do a reading
in this condition.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.734
No! Don't cancel
the reading!

12:15.736 --> 12:17.702
You worked so hard to get it!

12:17.704 --> 12:21.906
I got a backpack full of
<i> Pepperwoods,</i> and I'm ready.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.376
NICK:
Oh!

12:25.378 --> 12:26.778
JESS:
Aah!
Jess, I'm coming!

12:26.780 --> 12:28.747
Reagan, call shotgun.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.948
(groaning)

12:31.618 --> 12:33.952
(groaning)
Are you pulling?

12:33.954 --> 12:35.687
I can't feel you pulling.
Let me get your legs!

12:35.689 --> 12:38.590
Please don't drag her.
(grunting)

12:38.592 --> 12:40.925
(whispering):
Winston, where are you?

12:40.927 --> 12:44.062
We are freaking out
in increasingly weird ways.

12:44.064 --> 12:47.532
I'm at a costume shop, getting
ready for the big proposal.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.367
A costume shop?

12:49.369 --> 12:50.802
<i> All in good time.</i>

12:50.804 --> 12:53.605
Now, listen, when I text you, I
need you to bring Aly to Malibu.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.107
Okay? I don't want the two of us
to drive back separately.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.942
Plus, I want to make out
at red lights.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.544
Okay, Winston.
Just how much longer?
This is very

12:59.546 --> 13:01.780
important to me. If you mess
this up, you ruin my life, okay?

13:01.782 --> 13:02.947
No, Winston. Uh, uh...
Okay, bye!

13:02.949 --> 13:04.649
No. No, no, no. Uh...

13:04.651 --> 13:05.784
Ooh!

13:05.786 --> 13:08.553
So many marital
problems we have.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.755
My baby's got a
real sweet tooth.

13:10.757 --> 13:13.825
Just the other day, she ate an
entire sleeve of pecan sandies

13:13.827 --> 13:17.162
and punched the top right
off of a parking meter.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.897
It was the craziest thing
I've ever seen.
(Cece clears her throat)

13:18.899 --> 13:21.166
She yells at me
constantly and...

13:21.168 --> 13:24.903
There's one time
where she tipped over a table.

13:27.674 --> 13:30.642
He gambled away
another paycheck.

13:30.644 --> 13:31.810
Oh, no!

13:31.812 --> 13:33.945
It's the ponies.
I'm addicted.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.647
Right, right, right.
CECE:
It's true.

13:35.649 --> 13:38.016
All the money that
he wins on gambling,

13:38.018 --> 13:40.285
he puts up
his nose.
Oh.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.586
It's cocaine now, as well.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.154
Love me the ca-caine.
Ah, yeah.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.255
Feel invisible
when I do it.

13:44.257 --> 13:47.158
This feels like
some sort of weird foreplay.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.527
I'm out of here.
Wait. No. Aly, please. Um...

13:49.529 --> 13:51.262
Don't leave me
with this rage monster.

13:51.264 --> 13:54.032
Oh, yeah. You... I mean, you
want to see a rage monster?

13:54.034 --> 13:55.800
You want me to show
her the rage monster?

13:55.802 --> 13:57.936
Well, here you go.
No!

13:57.938 --> 13:59.704
Just...
Gosh darn.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.873
...tipping tables!
All right, that's...

14:01.875 --> 14:03.174
Uh, but I just...
Wait. Aly, Aly,
please don't leave.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.176
She belongs
in a mental hospital!
What?!

14:05.178 --> 14:07.779
I know what's happening. You
guys are trying to distract me

14:07.781 --> 14:10.949
from some weird thing
Winston's planning.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.218
Uh, no. Aly, no.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.820
Possibly a prank?

14:15.822 --> 14:17.555
Might be a zotz, a goof.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.123
If it's prank,
please tell him

14:19.125 --> 14:20.892
I wore bad underwear
today. Please.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.961
Frank Sinatra
strikes again.
It's a prank, it's a prank.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.229
That's exactly what it is.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.231
It's a prank. Great.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.866
Oh. Winston.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.968
Stranded in Malibu.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.836
All right, let's
get this over with.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.905
Winston.
Hmm. Yep.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.125
(Nick sighs)

14:37.126 --> 14:38.743
The good news is
I'm feeling sober.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.678
The bad news is maybe
I'm too sober.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.147
Yeah. I'm sobered up, too.
Great.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.583
Why are my eyes so good?

14:45.585 --> 14:48.253
I can read everything
from here.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.654
What does that mean?

14:49.656 --> 14:51.856
Oh, my God.
A secret world.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.224
Okay. I don't think
she's sober at all.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.225
(gasps)

14:54.227 --> 14:55.727
Okay. Hi.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.162
Thank you for supporting
your local bookstore.

14:58.164 --> 15:01.099
Quick reminder: We're dying.
Please buy things.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.767
I was feeling
very confident before,

15:02.769 --> 15:04.002
but I'm losing some of it,
so I think might just take

15:04.004 --> 15:05.870
one more quick pull.
No, no. No, no, no.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.705
No. Just one more quick pull.
Just one more quick.
Oh, my goodness.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.741
Is this gonna be a problem?

15:09.743 --> 15:11.009
Get it together.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.111
And now, please welcome
Nick Miller,

15:13.113 --> 15:15.246
author of
<i>The Pepperwood Chronicles.</i>

15:15.248 --> 15:16.915
(whispering):
No, no.
(applause)

15:18.051 --> 15:19.918
Go ahead... Nick.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.886
Go ahead.
They called...

15:21.888 --> 15:23.955
What a wonderful day.

15:23.957 --> 15:26.024
Quick reminder:
We are dying.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.930
I wrote this, every word.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.133
All of that.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.969
My hard work, not yours.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.038
It's not a competition.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.807
If everybody could stop looking
at me, that'd be really great.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.475
If you guys wouldn't mind
just closing your eyes,

15:44.477 --> 15:45.944
as if you were at some sort
of a show

15:45.946 --> 15:47.745
where you were asked
to close your eyes.

15:47.747 --> 15:48.947
What?
Thank you.

15:50.884 --> 15:52.183
Do you mind looking down, sir?

15:53.586 --> 15:55.053
(whispering):
Nick.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.855
All of these are for sale.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.698
What's that?
Yeah... coming.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.669
PATRON:
Is that it?
Um...

16:13.239 --> 16:15.206
NICK:
Don't worry about me,
I live here now.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.412
All right, what are we
gonna do? What's the plan?

16:21.414 --> 16:25.283
Well, it helps if you feed him
something first.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.453
Do you have any meat? Or nuts?

16:28.455 --> 16:29.620
Why would I have come
to the bookstore

16:29.622 --> 16:31.155
with meat and nuts in my purse?

16:31.157 --> 16:33.024
Okay. Caramels.
I don't have that.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.158
All right. Just tell him you
believe in him,

16:34.160 --> 16:35.360
and that he can do this.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.627
Yeah. I'm not good at this.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.529
Obviously. So...

16:38.531 --> 16:40.698
What would you say, Jess,
if you were me?

16:42.969 --> 16:45.303
I would say...

16:45.305 --> 16:47.638
(sighs)

16:47.640 --> 16:51.476
Nick, you're one of the most

16:51.478 --> 16:53.344
amazing people I've ever met.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.014
Everyone here is lucky
to hear your book,

16:56.016 --> 16:57.682
because it's a part of you.

16:57.684 --> 17:01.552
And if you fail, it doesn't
change how special you are.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.322
And no matter
what happens here,

17:04.324 --> 17:08.526
I'll always love you.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.695
Or something like that.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.697
That made me tear up
a little bit.

17:12.699 --> 17:13.998
I'm gonna use that.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.800
Okay.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.737
Hi, Nick.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.539
What are you doing?

17:21.541 --> 17:23.908
I'm just hanging out in here.
I'm just taking a break.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.644
Just, just having a moment...
yeah.

17:26.646 --> 17:30.915
Hey. No. You are,
you are amazing.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.383
And you, you're,

17:32.385 --> 17:34.085
you're, uh, special boy.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.653
Like, uh, um...

17:35.655 --> 17:38.556
You know, you-- like, uh,
you're, you are...

17:38.558 --> 17:41.392
very special,
you know what I'm saying.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.693
Uh, and let me start over.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.430
(clears throat)
Nick.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.231
I believe in you.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.938
Hey, this thing's awesome.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.239
Did that guy write this?

17:55.241 --> 17:57.508
Yeah. He sure did.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.743
There's a sadness about him.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.078
I know what you mean.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.014
JESS:
Oh, there's movement.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.650
(sighs)

18:06.953 --> 18:08.252
Sorry about that.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.188
Uh, that was some weird stuff.

18:11.591 --> 18:15.059
"The sun baked down on
Pepperwood's back

18:15.061 --> 18:18.629
"as he moved over
to the St. Charles streetcar.

18:18.631 --> 18:21.966
"The driver handed him
a brown paper sack.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.801
"Without opening it,
Pepperwood knew

18:23.803 --> 18:27.905
what was inside:
blood-soaked beignets."

18:27.907 --> 18:29.440
He is so dreamy.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.976
Oh, your life's
gonna be so hard.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.920
Okay, Bishop,
what is happening?

18:42.922 --> 18:44.222
Do you really need a spare?

18:44.224 --> 18:45.823
Oh, I got a spare.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.326
A spare cactus.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.294
Oh, my God.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.797
I planted it in this
spot that is perfect.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.433
You see, the cactus is common,

18:55.435 --> 18:57.401
but the company is not.

18:57.403 --> 18:58.803
Hello, beautiful.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.838
It's perfect.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.008
Come on.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.779
We should probably just
give them their privacy.

19:08.781 --> 19:09.947
Yeah, you're right,
you're right.
Holy hell.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.649
He's doing it.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.518
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
He's on a knee, here we go.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.019
It's happening.
Game time.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.854
It's a shoelace.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.789
False alarm.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.258
Okay, now here it is.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.193
Here it is.
It's happening.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.595
That is a ring.

19:24.597 --> 19:25.730
I don't think
that's a ring.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.433
Is he giving her
a gummy vitamin?

19:29.435 --> 19:31.802
(Cece gasps)
Okay, this is it,
this is it.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.871
And the other shoe?

19:33.873 --> 19:35.873
That's why I double
knot his laces.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.875
You know what? Let's stop
asking questions. Who knows?

19:37.877 --> 19:40.278
It's... their date.
It's their date.
What is this?

19:41.881 --> 19:44.882
Hey. You guys can
take off now.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.218
Of course. You want to be alone
for when you pop the question.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.187
Got it.
Wait. What?

19:49.189 --> 19:50.521
We're so excited
for the both of you.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.024
Oh. Oh, you thought I
was gonna propose today?

19:53.026 --> 19:55.493
No. Yo. That's hilarious.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.562
What do you mean
it's not today?

19:57.564 --> 20:00.031
No. This is just
phase one... of 20.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.732
What?
What?
Yeah.

20:01.734 --> 20:05.736
We went through all of this for
a non-proposal cactus picnic?

20:05.738 --> 20:07.371
Damn it, Winston.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.541
My girl deserves the grandest
proposal ever, okay?

20:10.543 --> 20:12.543
And that cannot be rushed.

20:12.545 --> 20:16.047
That is actually sweet.
That's not sweet.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.815
I te-- Here's a phase for you:

20:17.817 --> 20:19.584
When I throw you off
the cliff into the ocean.
Okay.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.819
Hey, look, don't worry.
For the next 20 weeks,

20:21.821 --> 20:25.556
I've only got you helping out
with odd-numbered phases, okay?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.692
And there will be
sub-phases, obviously.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.993
I ain't doing no sub-phases.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.229
Think of them as
annoyingly elaborate

20:31.231 --> 20:33.664
smaller phases.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.233
He's really pushing
his limits right now.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.735
Thank you so much for
your help. One phase down.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.071
Boop.
Don't boop him.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.607
Just one. I wish
we sold just one.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.041
Hey. You did great.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.376
JESS:
Nick. I'd like

20:45.378 --> 20:47.545
to introduce you to
your number one fan.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.413
Hey. I really enjoyed
what you read

20:49.415 --> 20:51.582
and hearing it and how
the characters were good,

20:51.584 --> 20:53.117
and how your face looks,

20:53.119 --> 20:54.952
and I want to hold it.
All right.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.187
Keep it cool,
keep it cool.

20:56.189 --> 20:57.421
I think Mariah would like

20:57.423 --> 20:59.690
to buy a copy of the book.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.425
You want to buy one?
Yes.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.095
How much ya got?
A dollar.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.130
Well, the purchase price
is $12.95, so...

21:06.132 --> 21:08.199
I'm comfortable with the dollar.
Okay, fine. A dollar's fine.

21:08.201 --> 21:09.467
Good deal.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.102
The signature's free
with the dollar.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.473
There you go.

21:15.475 --> 21:18.409
Thank you.
Don't read it
all in one place.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.444
You okay, Nick?

21:20.446 --> 21:21.612
Yeah. Just concerned about...

21:21.614 --> 21:23.447
The shed scene.
The shed scene.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.715
But I don't remember
the shed scene.
You don't remember

21:24.717 --> 21:26.984
the shed scene?
I don't remember it.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.587
It's an incredibly graphic
sexual scene.

21:29.589 --> 21:32.423
That's not good.
Disgustingly sexual.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.491
Who cares?

21:33.493 --> 21:34.925
My first sale!
REAGAN:
Congratulations.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.227
NICK:
<i> I did it.</i>

21:36.229 --> 21:37.928
JESS:<i> Yeah, Nick! </i>
NICK:<i> Yeah, me!</i>
