WEBVTT

00:02.627 --> 00:03.961
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:04.045 --> 00:06.047
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.131 --> 00:07.382
[door rattles]

00:07.465 --> 00:08.883
- BLESS ME FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.719
IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS
SINCE MY LAST CONFESSION.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.887
- AND WHAT IS YOUR SIN,
MY CHILD?

00:12.971 --> 00:13.930
- WELL, I--I LIED.

00:14.013 --> 00:15.557
I TOLD MY FRIEND JOY

00:15.640 --> 00:17.058
THAT I HAD A GREAT GUY
TO FIX HER UP WITH,

00:17.142 --> 00:18.268
BUT, REALLY,
I HAVE NO ONE.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.145
- WELL, YOU SHOULD
BE HONEST WITH HER.

00:20.228 --> 00:22.188
IF SHE'S TRULY A FRIEND,
SHE'LL FORGIVE YOU.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.065
- NO, FATHER,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.817
INSTEAD OF CELEBRATING
OUR BIRTHDAYS,

00:25.900 --> 00:28.111
WE HAVE THIS ANNUAL THING
CALLED BIRTH DATES,

00:28.194 --> 00:30.071
WHERE MY FRIENDS AND I
SET EACH OTHER UP.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.448
IT'S KIND OF A TRADITION
FOR US.

00:32.531 --> 00:33.950
- WELL, THAT SOUNDS ENJOYABLE.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.618
- [laughs]
YEAH, IT DOES.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.953
BUT IT'S NOT.

00:37.036 --> 00:39.122
THE DATES ARE USUALLY
DISASTERS.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.999
BETWEEN THE CONJOINED TWINS,
THE GUY WITH BREASTS,

00:41.082 --> 00:43.209
AND THE MAN I THOUGHT
WAS JESUS.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.631
I--I MEAN, THAT--
THAT ONE WAS GREAT.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.342
- WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE
EXPERIENCE SADNESS

00:51.426 --> 00:52.510
ON THEIR BIRTHDAYS.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.429
I'VE NOTICED THAT
THE OLDER NUNS

00:54.512 --> 00:57.098
OFTEN EXPERIENCE
A CERTAIN MELANCHOLY

00:57.182 --> 01:00.685
WHEN WE TAKE THEM TO ARBY'S
ON THEIR SPECIAL DAY.

01:00.769 --> 01:04.355
- SEE, I DON'T WANT MY FRIEND
TO FEEL LIKE THE NUNS AT ARBY'S.

01:04.438 --> 01:06.483
BUT SHE'S NOT
MAKING THIS EASY.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.693
SHE'S BEEN VERY SPECIFIC
ABOUT NOT WANTING

01:08.777 --> 01:12.947
ANYONE WITH BAGGAGE OR--
OR WEIRD STUFF IN THEIR PAST.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.657
- SAY, LISTEN, UH...

01:14.741 --> 01:18.328
DO YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE
A PICTURE OF HER?

01:18.411 --> 01:20.872
- YOU SET ME UP
WITH A PRIEST?

01:20.955 --> 01:21.956
- NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.374
HE'S GIVING UP
THE PRIESTHOOD.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.126
HE NO LONGER BELIEVES
IT'S HIS CALLING.

01:25.210 --> 01:28.505
SO...GOD'S LOSS
IS YOUR GAIN.

01:28.588 --> 01:32.467
- WOW, SO HIS FIRST DATE EVER
WILL BE WITH JOY?

01:32.550 --> 01:34.719
[laughter]

01:34.803 --> 01:38.515
- SHOULDN'T HE GO ON
ONE OF THE KIDDIE RIDES FIRST?

01:41.100 --> 01:42.185
- YOU'RE GONNA LOVE HIM.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.770
HE'S A REALLY GREAT GUY.

01:43.853 --> 01:46.189
HE PUTS THE COMMUNION WAFER
ON YOUR TONGUE

01:46.272 --> 01:47.690
WITH SUCH ASSURANCE.

01:47.774 --> 01:51.152
SO STRONG, YET SO TENDER.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.695
- I THINK YOU MIGHT
HAVE TO BE CATHOLIC

01:52.779 --> 01:55.698
FOR THAT TO BE HOT.

01:55.782 --> 01:59.035
ALTHOUGH...WITH NO PRIOR
ROMANTIC EXPERIENCE,

01:59.118 --> 02:01.204
HE'S GONNA NEED SOMEONE
TO HELP HIM...

02:01.287 --> 02:04.499
GUIDE HIM, MOLD HIM
INTO EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS.

02:04.582 --> 02:06.334
[laughs]

02:06.417 --> 02:08.877
IT'S ALMOST TOO EASY.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.047
- AND HOW'S THE HUNT
FOR MY DATE GOING?

02:11.131 --> 02:11.965
- OH, TRUST ME, VICTORIA,

02:12.048 --> 02:14.008
I HAVE FOUND
THE PERFECT PERSON FOR YOU.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.426
- PHYSICALLY PERFECT, RIGHT?

02:15.510 --> 02:19.222
NOT THAT "BEAUTIFUL
ON THE INSIDE" NONSENSE.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.890
- I PROMISE,
YOU'RE GONNA BE THRILLED.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.059
- I BETTER BE.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.061
SO, ELKA,
WHAT KIND OF A MAN

02:25.144 --> 02:26.688
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO FIND FOR YOU?

02:26.771 --> 02:28.231
- YOU KNOW HOW
LAST YEAR

02:28.314 --> 02:30.275
ALL I WANTED
WAS A BILLIONAIRE?

02:30.358 --> 02:31.901
- AND YOU LEARNED
YOUR LESSON, HMM?

02:31.985 --> 02:33.862
- YES, I LEARNED MY LESSON.

02:33.945 --> 02:37.615
I WANT ANOTHER BILLIONAIRE.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.075
- WELL, I'M ALL SET.

02:39.158 --> 02:40.410
REMEMBER WHEN WE SAW
<i>JERSEY BOYS,</i>

02:40.493 --> 02:41.244
AND I THOUGHT THE GUY THAT
PLAYED FRANKIE VALLI

02:41.327 --> 02:42.912
WAS SO CUTE.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.540
WELL, ELKA SOMEHOW
GOT ME A DATE WITH HIM.

02:45.623 --> 02:48.001
- I JUST EMAILED HIM
A NAKED PICTURE.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.255
- OF...
- YOU.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.966
I--I TOOK IT
WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.760
- I DON'T SLEEP NAKED.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.263
- I TOOK SOME LIBERTIES.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.276
{\an8}- OH, NO.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.069
{\an8}ELKA, I JUST GOT A TEXT
FROM YOUR BILLIONAIRE.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.446
{\an8}HE--HE CAN'T MAKE IT.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.323
{\an8}- REALLY? WHY?

03:18.406 --> 03:20.241
{\an8}- WELL, I GUESS
HE WAS SOMEWHAT INVOLVED

03:20.325 --> 03:23.661
{\an8}IN A DRUG CARTEL.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.622
{\an8}- DRUG CARTEL?

03:25.705 --> 03:28.291
{\an8}DID YOU DO ANY RESEARCH
AT ALL?

03:28.374 --> 03:32.545
{\an8}- SERIOUSLY? A BILLIONAIRE
WHO WANTS TO DATE A 90-YEAR-OLD?

03:34.213 --> 03:37.800
{\an8}FIRST "YES" YOU GET,
YOU GO, "OKAY."

03:37.884 --> 03:40.637
{\an8}BUT, ELKA, THIS I VOW:

03:40.720 --> 03:45.433
{\an8}I WILL NOT REST UNTIL
I FIND YOU THE PERFECT DATE.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.477
{\an8}HEY, IS ANYBODY HERE
OVER 80?

03:49.020 --> 03:49.938
{\an8}OH! WELL...

03:50.021 --> 03:52.190
{\an8}THERE YOU GO.

03:52.273 --> 03:56.152
{\an8}- LUCKY FOR YOU
I LIKE FACIAL HAIR.

03:56.235 --> 03:58.696
{\an8}I MEAN ON MEN.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.744
{\an8}- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON
OVER THERE?

04:04.827 --> 04:07.330
{\an8}- OH, I THINK
I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.624
{\an8}OH, CAPTAIN!

04:09.707 --> 04:11.668
{\an8}- [gasps]
CAPTAIN LEBEAU?

04:11.751 --> 04:13.336
{\an8}[chuckles]

04:13.419 --> 04:16.297
{\an8}- [French accent]
VICTORIA...LOOK AT YOU.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.843
{\an8}YOU'RE A TEN IF BY LAND
AND A TEN IF BY SEA.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.178
{\an8}- OH, WELL.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.680
{\an8}- DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE?

04:23.763 --> 04:26.808
{\an8}- DOES IT MATTER?

04:26.891 --> 04:28.351
{\an8}- SO, UH, AHEM,

04:28.434 --> 04:29.686
{\an8}WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

04:29.769 --> 04:32.021
{\an8}- OH, UP NORTH.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.316
- CANADA?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.860
- A LITTLE FARTHER NORTH
THAN THAT.

04:37.944 --> 04:41.698
I HAVE A RATHER LARGE TOY
DISTRIBUTION CENTER UP THERE.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.867
IT'S A SEASONAL BUSINESS.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.077
- FATHER BRIAN!

04:46.160 --> 04:47.078
- OH.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.705
- OH, HE'S CUTE.
- YEAH.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.498
JOY, THIS IS FATHER BRIAN.

04:50.581 --> 04:51.916
- OH, IT'S JUST BRIAN.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.043
AS OF TWO HOURS AGO!

04:54.127 --> 04:56.087
HERE, I GOT THIS FOR YOU.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.715
- OH, A--A WRIST CORSAGE.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.010
- OH, IT'S WRONG,
ISN'T IT?

05:02.093 --> 05:05.471
I'M SORRY.
MY LAST DATE WAS JUNIOR PROM.

05:07.306 --> 05:12.228
- IS THERE A
MRS. SEASONALLY-BASED TOYMAKER?

05:12.311 --> 05:14.731
- THERE WAS,
BUT WE'RE TAKING A BREAK.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.400
- OH, I GET IT.

05:17.483 --> 05:20.361
MY MAX AND I HAVE
WHAT WE CALL A...

05:20.445 --> 05:22.739
AN AREA CODE RELATIONSHIP.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.240
- WHAT'S THAT?

05:24.323 --> 05:26.576
- WELL, WHEN WE'RE
IN THE SAME AREA CODE,

05:26.659 --> 05:29.412
WE'RE FAITHFUL.

05:29.495 --> 05:33.541
BUT IF HE'S OFF GALLIVANTING
WITH THOSE WHORES IN BOCA...

05:33.624 --> 05:35.585
I GET TO HAVE MY FUN.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.462
- OH! OH.

05:37.545 --> 05:38.755
[laughing] OH, OH, HO.

05:38.838 --> 05:39.881
HO HO HO.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.469
WELL, YOU'RE A PLAYFUL
LITTLE ELF, AREN'T YOU?

05:53.811 --> 05:54.979
- HI, JIMMIE.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.898
I'M MELANIE.
I--I--

05:56.981 --> 05:58.941
I LOVED YOU IN <i> JERSEY BOYS.</i>

05:59.025 --> 06:00.568
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY
I'M VERY EMBARRASSED

06:00.651 --> 06:01.944
THAT FRIEND
SENT THAT PICTURE TO YOU.

06:02.028 --> 06:05.907
- [high, squeaky voice]
AH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.658
I THOUGHT YOU
LOOKED FANTASTIC.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.911
- [laughs]

06:09.994 --> 06:11.454
- WHAT?

06:11.537 --> 06:12.914
- WELL, I KNOW YOU SING
IN A HIGH PITCH,

06:12.997 --> 06:13.956
BUT IS THAT HOW YOU--

06:14.040 --> 06:16.918
- I LOWER MY VOICE
FOR THE SPEAKING PERFORMANCE,

06:17.001 --> 06:18.586
BUT IT'S REALLY BAD

06:18.669 --> 06:19.754
[lower voice]
IF I DO IT ALL THE TIME.

06:19.837 --> 06:21.798
[high voice]
I GET NODES. AHEM.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.300
- AND WE'RE SURE
THAT'S WORSE?

06:24.383 --> 06:26.427
- WELL, THIS IS...
THE WAY I TALK.

06:26.511 --> 06:30.681
IS--IS THAT GONNA
BE A PROBLEM?

06:30.765 --> 06:33.309
- NO! NO, NOT AT ALL.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.603
I LOVE IT.

06:35.686 --> 06:38.439
- WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
AN EXCELLENT TIME.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.149
[piercing]
OH, WHAT A NIGHT!

06:43.694 --> 06:45.113
- NO, YOU'RE PERFECT.

06:45.196 --> 06:47.156
A PERFECT SPECIMEN OF A MAN.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.326
- WELL, EVERYONE HAS
AN IMPERFECTION.

06:50.409 --> 06:52.662
YOU KNOW, FRECKLE, MOLE.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.164
A TAIL.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.499
- A WHAT?

06:56.582 --> 06:58.501
- A FRECKLE ON MY BACK,
FROM THE SUN.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.671
I SWAB THE DECK SHIRTLESS.

07:01.754 --> 07:02.505
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.841
WHAT WAS THAT LAST THING
YOU SAID?

07:04.924 --> 07:05.842
A TAIL?

07:05.925 --> 07:08.678
- I HAVE A TAIL.
YOU KNOW...

07:08.761 --> 07:11.347
A TAIL.

07:11.430 --> 07:13.516
AM I USING THE RIGHT
ENGLISH WORD?

07:13.599 --> 07:15.476
- OH, GOD, I HOPE NOT.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.483
- SO YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
WITH A WOMAN BEFORE?

07:22.567 --> 07:23.985
- NO.

07:24.068 --> 07:26.195
I FEEL SO CLUELESS
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.364
ALL I KNOW IS WHAT
I'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE

07:28.447 --> 07:30.283
WHO THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
TO GO TO A CELIBATE GUY

07:30.366 --> 07:33.536
FOR ADVICE
ON THEIR SEX LIFE.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.038
- ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE TO HELP YOU?

07:36.122 --> 07:38.207
GUIDE YOU?
MOLD YOU?

07:38.291 --> 07:41.085
- WELL, THAT WOULD
BE FANTASTIC.

07:41.169 --> 07:45.089
- WELL, IF YOU WANT TO BE
THE BEST LOVER ON THE PLANET,

07:45.173 --> 07:47.675
LISTEN TO EVERY SINGLE THING
THE WOMAN SAYS

07:47.758 --> 07:51.345
AND SPEND LOTS AND LOTS OF TIME
DOING THOSE THINGS.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.055
- REALLY?

07:53.139 --> 07:55.224
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT HOW
I HEAR IT DESCRIBED

07:55.308 --> 07:57.560
IN CONFESSION.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.687
- WELL, FORGET EVERYTHING
YOU'VE HEARD IN CONFESSIONAL.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.355
LOOK TO ME FOR GUIDANCE.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.400
- OH, I TRULY FEEL I CAN.

08:04.483 --> 08:06.360
OH, JOY...
YOU'RE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL,

08:06.444 --> 08:08.905
FASCINATING CREATURE
GOD EVER MADE.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.365
- OH, MY.
- I'M SORRY.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.284
IS THAT A NORMAL THING TO SAY
ON A FIRST DATE?

08:13.367 --> 08:14.577
- YEP, TOTALLY NORMAL.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.620
KEEP 'EM COMING.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.291
- I DID <i> JERSEY BOYS</i>
FOR THE MONEY.

08:20.374 --> 08:23.628
BUT WHAT REALLY FEEDS
MY SOUL IS VOLUNTEERING.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.755
- REALLY?
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

08:25.838 --> 08:27.298
- I JUST GOT BACK
FROM VOLUNTEERING

08:27.381 --> 08:30.927
FROM A DEPRESSED TOWN
IN NORTHEASTERN NAMIBIA.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.886
TOTALLY WIPED OUT BY A FLOOD.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.597
THE WATER KEPT GETTING
HIGHER...

08:35.681 --> 08:38.934
AND HIGHER...

08:39.018 --> 08:41.312
- CAN I GET YOU GUYS
ANYTHING ELSE TO DRINK?

08:41.395 --> 08:42.897
- SHERRY?

08:47.318 --> 08:48.736
SHERRY, BABY?

08:51.113 --> 08:52.823
- A VESTIGIAL TAIL.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.450
THAT REALLY EXISTS?

08:54.533 --> 08:56.452
- MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID
IT MADE ME SPECIAL.

08:56.535 --> 08:58.287
- OH.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.332
- BUT ENOUGH ABOUT THE TAIL.
- MM.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.751
- I ONLY HAVE TWO DAYS
IN CLEVELAND.

09:03.834 --> 09:08.631
HOW SHOULD WE SPEND THIS BRIEF
BUT MAGNIFICENT TIME TOGETHER?

09:08.714 --> 09:10.341
- WELL, LET'S SEE, UM...

09:10.424 --> 09:11.550
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SOME
FABULOUS RESTAURANTS.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.011
AND THEN, OF COURSE, THERE'S
THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF--

09:14.095 --> 09:15.846
OKAY, THE TAIL.
JUST TELL ME HOW LONG IT IS.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.683
I--I REALLY NEED TO KNOW.
I'M PICTURING IT LIKE--

09:18.766 --> 09:21.310
LIKE THE NUB OF A BOXER.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.979
- I HAVE NO NUB.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.480
I'M A GROWN MAN.

09:24.563 --> 09:26.274
I HAVE A GROWN MAN'S TAIL.

09:28.567 --> 09:31.862
- HE HAS A TAIL!

09:31.946 --> 09:34.824
NOW, HOW COULD WE
NOT KNOW THIS?

09:34.907 --> 09:37.159
- WELL, I NEVER GOT THAT FAR
WITH HIM ON THE BOAT.

09:37.243 --> 09:41.497
- NOR WERE THERE ANY FLIES
TO WHAP AWAY.

09:41.580 --> 09:42.999
[laughter]

09:43.082 --> 09:45.334
- I'M GLAD THAT YOU ALL
FIND THIS SO AMUSING.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.836
- I'M SORRY,
IT JUST FEELS SO GOOD

09:46.919 --> 09:48.129
TO BE ABLE TO LAUGH.

09:48.212 --> 09:49.505
MY DATE SOUNDS
LIKE MICKEY MOUSE,

09:49.588 --> 09:51.007
AND I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
KEEPING IT TOGETHER

09:51.090 --> 09:52.466
EVERY TIME HE TALKS.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.801
- [squeaky voice]
EXCUSE ME.

09:53.884 --> 09:55.636
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE LITTLE BOY'S ROOM IS?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.013
- THAT'S HIM.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.848
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DEAL WITH THAT?

09:58.931 --> 10:00.182
- ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.475
NOW, WHENEVER
I FELT LIKE I WAS ABOUT

10:01.559 --> 10:03.227
TO RUIN A SCENE
BY LAUGHING,

10:03.311 --> 10:05.229
I WOULD BITE
THE INSIDE OF MY MOUTH.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.606
I ONCE LOST A LARGE
CHUNK OF CHEEK

10:07.690 --> 10:13.696
WHEN I WAS DOING <i> LOVE LETTERS</i>
OPPOSITE ESPN'S CHRIS BERMAN.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.324
- WELL, MY DATE
IS GOING GREAT.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.200
HE FINDS ME SO IRRESISTIBLE.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.578
HE'S GIVING UP
THE PRIESTHOOD FOR ME.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.538
LIKE IN <i> THE THORN BIRDS.</i>

10:22.621 --> 10:24.999
- WELL, MY DATE...

10:25.082 --> 10:28.044
IS SANTA CLAUS.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.545
- YOU MEAN, HE LOOKS LIKE
SANTA CLAUS?

10:29.628 --> 10:33.007
- NO, I THINK
HE IS SANTA CLAUS.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.217
BUT THINGS AREN'T
GOING SO WELL FOR HIM.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.386
HE AND MRS. CLAUS
ARE TAKING A BREAK.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.806
IT--OH, IT'S A WHOLE THING.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.892
- AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE'S SANTA?

10:42.975 --> 10:44.852
- LOOK, I'M NOT CRAZY.

10:44.935 --> 10:47.730
EVERYTHING HE SAYS
POINTS STRAIGHT TO IT.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.566
I'LL GET HIM TO ADMIT IT.
YOU JUST WAIT.

10:50.649 --> 10:53.736
- ELKA, YOU HAVE
A VERY ACTIVE IMAGINATION.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.905
HOWEVER, MAY I
REMIND EVERYONE

10:55.988 --> 10:59.367
THAT MY DATE HAS A TAIL.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.620
- YEAH, NOW, IS IT A BIG TAIL,
OR IS IT MORE LIKE A STUB?

11:02.703 --> 11:04.455
- HE'S A GROWN MAN...

11:04.538 --> 11:06.874
[crying]
IT'S A GROWN MAN'S TAIL.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.095
- [chuckles softly
and sighs]

11:19.178 --> 11:21.889
[fork clanks on floor]
- OH, I AM SO SORRY.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.641
- NO PROBLEM.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.101
- SANTA...
- YES?

11:25.184 --> 11:27.103
- I KNEW IT!

11:27.186 --> 11:28.729
YOU ARE SANTA CLAUS.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.398
- ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, OKAY.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.900
NOT SO LOUDLY.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.443
- YEAH, BUT WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

11:34.527 --> 11:35.986
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

11:36.070 --> 11:37.363
- WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW,

11:37.446 --> 11:38.948
I--I LIKE CLEVELAND.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.616
I FIT IN.

11:40.699 --> 11:45.204
I'VE DECIDED TO MOVE HERE
AND OPEN A CHIPOTLE.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.956
- CHIPOTLE?

11:47.039 --> 11:48.582
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
GREAT BURRITOS,

11:48.666 --> 11:52.128
ORGANIC INGREDIENTS...
- I KNOW WHAT CHIPOTLE IS.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.422
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU
BEING SANTA?

11:54.505 --> 11:57.967
- WELL, FRANKLY,
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.844
YOU TRY CARRYING AROUND
THE BURDEN OF KNOWING

11:59.927 --> 12:01.762
WHO'S NAUGHTY AND WHO'S NICE.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.597
IT'S TOO MUCH FOR ONE MAN.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.641
WELL,
YOU TAKE THIS BAR HERE.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.810
NAUGHTY.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.312
REAL NAUGHTY.

12:10.396 --> 12:11.856
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

12:11.939 --> 12:15.276
- WELL, YOU'RE JUST
NAUGHTY ENOUGH.

12:15.359 --> 12:16.819
- OH, SANTA.

12:16.902 --> 12:20.781
[laughs]

12:20.865 --> 12:22.575
- AND, FINALLY,
THE GOLDEN RULE

12:22.658 --> 12:24.326
IS THE THREE-SECOND RULE.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.953
- WHAT'S THAT?

12:26.036 --> 12:27.705
- IT MEANS YOU CAN'T
LOOK AT ANOTHER WOMAN

12:27.788 --> 12:30.332
FOR MORE THAN THREE SECONDS.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.711
- WELL, WHY WOULD I DO THAT
WHEN I'M LOOKING AT YOU?

12:33.794 --> 12:35.296
- THAT DOES SOUND CRAZY.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.505
- YEAH.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.715
- BUT SOME MEN--

12:37.798 --> 12:39.550
BAD MEN--
LIKE TO SCOPE OUT

12:39.633 --> 12:40.843
ALL THE OTHER WOMEN
IN THE ROOM.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.804
- REALLY?
I WONDER WHY.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.186
I THINK I MIGHT
BE A BAD MAN.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.481
- NO! YOU'RE NOT
A BAD MAN.

12:53.564 --> 12:54.899
STOP LOOKING!

12:54.982 --> 12:57.485
- WOW. I AM BREAKING
<i>MATTHEW</i> 5:28

12:57.568 --> 12:59.361
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.988
I MEAN, LOOK AT THOSE LEGS.

13:01.071 --> 13:03.324
- YES, LOOK AT THEM!

13:03.407 --> 13:05.367
- ALTHOUGH, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I'M NOT A LEG MAN.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.786
MAYBE I'M INTO
SOMETHING ELSE.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.375
- NO, NO--YOU'RE
DEFINITELY A LEG MAN.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.295
- I'VE BEEN GIVING COMMUNION
TO <i> THAT?</i>

13:18.130 --> 13:19.590
- SO, TELL ME,
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF...

13:19.673 --> 13:21.008
HAVING IT REMOVED?

13:21.091 --> 13:22.760
- YOU AMERICANS.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.512
YOU ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE
PLASTIC SURGERY

13:24.595 --> 13:26.931
TO GET RID OF ANY
TINY IMPERFECTION.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.432
THIS IS NOT HOW
WE DO IT IN FRANCE.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.351
- NO, BUT IN YOUR
CIRCUMSTANCE--

13:30.434 --> 13:33.896
- IT IS SAID THAT THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD--

13:33.979 --> 13:36.398
CATHERINE DENEUVE--
HAS A TAIL.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.442
- WHAT?

13:38.526 --> 13:39.902
- YOU KNOW THE SAYING.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.737
"YOU WOULDN'T KICK
CATHERINE DENEUVE OUT OF BED

13:41.820 --> 13:44.281
FOR WAGGING HER TAIL."

13:44.365 --> 13:46.075
- NO.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.243
- WELL...

13:47.326 --> 13:50.412
IN FRENCH, IT RHYMES.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.540
AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE CLEVER.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.797
- SO WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING
WHEN <i> JERSEY BOYS</i> IS OVER?

13:59.880 --> 14:00.631
- ACTUALLY,
I'M AUDITIONING

14:00.714 --> 14:03.801
FOR A PRODUCTION
OF <i> RICHARD III.</i>

14:03.884 --> 14:05.553
- REALLY?
I LOVE SHAKESPEARE.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.721
- REALLY?
WELL, THEN...

14:07.805 --> 14:09.765
[clears throat]
- OH, GOSH.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.812
NOW IS THE WINTER
OF OUR DISCONTENT

14:14.895 --> 14:19.316
MADE GLORIOUS SUMMER
BY THIS SUN OF YORK.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.779
AND ALL THE CLOUDS
THAT LOUR'D UPON OUR HOUSE...

14:23.862 --> 14:26.073
- AND THEN I INTRODUCED HIM
TO SCOPING,

14:26.156 --> 14:27.825
AND HE SCOPED OUT
MELANIE'S BREASTS.

14:27.908 --> 14:30.995
- THEY ARE HAVING
A GOOD NIGHT TONIGHT.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.664
I MEAN, RUDE!

14:33.747 --> 14:36.625
- I WAS SO CLOSE TO CREATING
THE PERFECT MAN.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.252
- THERE'S NO SUCH THING, JOY.

14:38.335 --> 14:43.090
EVEN GOD TAKES A PERFECT MAN
AND SLAPS A TAIL ON HIM.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.175
- SO HOW'S IT GOING
ON YOUR DATE, ELKA?

14:45.259 --> 14:46.927
- OH, NOT WELL.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.638
I MEAN, HE'S ADMITTED
HE IS SANTA,

14:49.722 --> 14:51.974
BUT HE WANTS
TO QUIT HIS JOB.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.809
- WELL, HE CAN'T DO THAT.

14:53.892 --> 14:56.937
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
IF WE DON'T HAVE SANTA.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.981
AND WE ALL NEED
A LITTLE MAGIC IN THIS WORLD.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.858
- WE DO NEED MAGIC.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.484
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GO OUT THERE

15:02.568 --> 15:05.195
AND SAVE CHRISTMAS, ELKA.

15:05.279 --> 15:09.116
- YOU HAVE NEVER
BEEN SO RIGHT.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.118
THANK YOU, VICTORIA.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.831
- OKAY, CRAZY LADY'S GONE.

15:15.914 --> 15:18.667
AND I HAVE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.961
THE CAPTAIN IS NOT INTERESTED
IN LOSING HIS TAIL,

15:21.045 --> 15:23.631
AND I HAVE DECIDED
TO RESPECT HIS CHOICE.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.299
- WELL, THAT'S VERY
GROWN UP OF YOU.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.676
- HEY, LISTEN, I'VE GONE OUT
WITH MY SHARE OF MEN

15:27.760 --> 15:29.678
WHO I WOULD RATE
A SIX AT BEST.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.806
GOING INTO THIS DATE,
CAPTAIN LEBEAU IS A 10.

15:32.890 --> 15:36.518
AND THE TAIL, AH, MAYBE
KNOCKS HIM DOWN TO AN EIGHT.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.520
- SO DOES IT WAG
WHEN HE'S HAPPY,

15:38.604 --> 15:40.689
OR GET ALL FLUFFY
WHEN HE'S SCARED?

15:40.773 --> 15:44.026
- IT ISN'T FURRY, MELANIE.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.194
I DON'T THINK.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.738
HE'S AN EIGHT!

15:50.324 --> 15:55.329
- YOU NEED TO KEEP DOING GOOD
TO INSPIRE GOOD IN THE WORLD.

15:55.412 --> 15:57.331
- THERE ALREADY IS
GOOD IN THE WORLD.

15:57.414 --> 16:00.668
CHIPOTLE IS GOOD.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.044
- OKAY, SANTA.

16:02.127 --> 16:06.173
I REALLY NEED YOU
TO FORGET CHIPOTLE

16:06.256 --> 16:08.175
AND LISTEN TO ME.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.219
- ALL RIGHT.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.055
- WHEN I WAS A--
A CHILD IN POLAND,

16:13.138 --> 16:17.017
I MEAN, MY FAMILY HAD
HAD A PARTICULARLY HARD YEAR.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.978
WE DIDN'T EXPECT ANY PRESENTS
FOR CHRISTMAS.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.564
BUT...SOMEHOW, THERE WERE.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.942
- WELL, THAT WAS MY JOB.

16:25.025 --> 16:28.070
- I MEAN, THERE WEREN'T
MILLIONS OF GIFTS.

16:28.153 --> 16:32.241
BUT THE FACT THAT YOU CAME
AT ALL MEANT EVERYTHING TO US.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.242
TO ME.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.828
- OH...ELKA...

16:37.871 --> 16:40.249
- HELLO, MELANIE.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.959
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:42.042 --> 16:44.211
- OH, I JUST HAVE TO
ASK MELANIE A QUESTION.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.422
- WHY?

16:46.505 --> 16:47.798
- DON'T WORRY, JOY.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.633
I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.886
I'M JUST ALSO IN LOVE
WITH YOUR BREASTS.

16:52.970 --> 16:56.265
- NOT COOL, DUDE!

16:56.348 --> 16:57.266
NOT COOL!

16:57.349 --> 16:59.268
- [laughing]

16:59.351 --> 17:00.436
- AM I FUNNY?

17:00.519 --> 17:01.729
I MAKE YOU LAUGH?

17:01.812 --> 17:03.814
- I'M SORRY, BUT,
YES, YOU DO.

17:03.897 --> 17:07.192
AND, UH, COULD YOU SAY,
"OH, NO, MR. BILL," FOR ME?

17:07.276 --> 17:09.111
[laughing]

17:09.194 --> 17:10.112
- JIMMY, PLEASE--

17:10.194 --> 17:11.571
- I AM GONNA WASTE YOUR ASS--

17:11.655 --> 17:14.116
- GENTLEMEN, STOP!

17:14.199 --> 17:17.327
SIR, YOU CAME HERE
WITH ONE WOMAN.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.788
AND THIS IS WHO
YOU WILL STAY WITH.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.957
I WOULD NEVER
TALK TO ANOTHER WOMAN

17:22.040 --> 17:24.585
WHEN I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO BE IN THE PRESENCE OF

17:24.667 --> 17:26.962
BEAUTIFUL VICTORIA CHASE.

17:27.045 --> 17:31.633
- HE JUST GOT BUMPED UP
TO A NINE.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.343
- AND YOU, SIR, YES,

17:33.427 --> 17:36.597
YOU HAVE A SILLY VOICE
THAT PEOPLE LAUGH AT.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.515
BUT YOU SHOULD BE
PROUD OF YOURSELF...

17:38.599 --> 17:40.350
NO MATTER YOUR SHORTCOMINGS.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.978
I, MYSELF, HAVE--

17:43.061 --> 17:44.062
- A BEAUTIFUL FACE!

17:44.146 --> 17:46.356
AND, REALLY, NOTHING ELSE
REALLY MATTERS, DOES IT?

17:46.440 --> 17:48.108
GREAT SPEECH.
COME ON.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.322
- [laughing]
WELL, THAT WAS ENTERTAINING.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.992
I...

17:57.076 --> 17:58.452
EXCUSE ME, MISS.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.370
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE GENTLEMAN

18:00.454 --> 18:01.747
WHO WAS SITTING HERE?

18:01.830 --> 18:03.874
- WHO, ERIC?
I DON'T KNOW.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.542
MAYBE HE WENT BACK
TO THE HOMELESS SHELTER.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.170
- OH...
- OH, HE'S OFF HIS ROCKER.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.505
YOU KNOW, HE TOLD
A WAITRESS HERE

18:09.588 --> 18:11.256
THAT HE WAS SANTA.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.342
CRAZY OLD DUDE.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.885
- LISTEN, MISSY,

18:14.968 --> 18:16.345
THAT KIND OF NAME CALLING

18:16.428 --> 18:18.013
WON'T GET YOU
OFF THE NAUGHTY LIST

18:18.096 --> 18:20.808
ANYTIME SOON.

18:24.102 --> 18:26.688
- I'M SORRY
I GOT CARRIED AWAY.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.358
I'LL ALWAYS THINK OF YOU
AS MY FIRST, JOY.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.068
- UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY
HAVE YOUR FIRST,

18:31.151 --> 18:33.695
AND THEN YOU REALLY WON'T.

18:37.115 --> 18:40.911
- SO I...GUESS MY VOICE
IS TOO RIDICULOUS.

18:40.994 --> 18:43.747
- I'M SO SORRY
I HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.375
I'M VERY IMMATURE.

18:46.458 --> 18:50.546
- MELANIE...

18:50.629 --> 18:51.547
LET'S JUST SAY

18:51.630 --> 18:53.507
EVERY NIGHT ON STAGE,

18:53.590 --> 18:57.094
I SING,<i> BIG GIRLS DON'T CRY.</i>

18:57.177 --> 18:58.428
BUT TONIGHT, WELL,

18:58.512 --> 19:00.556
THIS BIG BOY...

19:00.639 --> 19:01.932
ACTUALLY MIGHT.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.606
[deeper voice] YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU MISSED.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.149
- WELL, NOW I WANT YOU BACK.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.109

- OKAY.

19:16.363 --> 19:17.948

19:18.031 --> 19:19.867
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO BACK
TO MY HOTEL ROOM?

19:19.950 --> 19:22.077

19:33.714 --> 19:36.884
TWO GLASSES OF WINE.

19:36.967 --> 19:41.763

MOST OF THE MUSHROOM CAPS.

19:41.847 --> 19:46.018

$37 TO MY $32.

19:46.101 --> 19:49.271

TO TAKE THE TAIL.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.859
BUT BEING CHEAP, HO HO,

19:53.942 --> 19:56.987
THAT TAKES YOU
DOWN TO A FIVE.

19:57.070 --> 20:00.782
AND I...
WILL NOT DATE A FIVE.

20:08.707 --> 20:09.708
{\an8}- SO WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED
ON OUR SPECIAL DAY?

20:09.791 --> 20:11.084

A TERRIBLE IDEA.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.795
{\an8}- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.797
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST FORGET

20:15.881 --> 20:17.257
{\an8}FIXING EACH OTHER UP
WITH MEN

20:17.341 --> 20:18.634
{\an8}AND ENJOY
EACH OTHER'S COMPANY.
