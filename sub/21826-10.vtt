WEBVTT

00:03.001 --> 00:05.108
Previously on "The Mindy Project"...

00:05.164 --> 00:07.460
During my last mammogram,
they found a lump.

00:07.499 --> 00:09.857
- It's malignant.
- I talked to Dr. Richlin.

00:09.905 --> 00:12.591
He wants to do a double
mastectomy just to be safe.

00:12.646 --> 00:13.771
And Ma said yes.

00:13.833 --> 00:15.674
Morgan, I tried on the ring.

00:15.741 --> 00:17.051
Does that mean you're gonna say yes?

00:17.107 --> 00:18.169
Yes!

00:18.208 --> 00:19.739
I've met a woman. I've fallen in love,

00:19.774 --> 00:21.161
and we're moving to Africa together.

00:21.192 --> 00:22.489
And since I won't be drawing a salary

00:22.551 --> 00:24.630
from Physicians on the Front,
I need to pull my equity out

00:24.684 --> 00:27.012
- of Later, Baby as soon as possible.
- Wha...

00:31.023 --> 00:32.758
Melville, tell it to me straight.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.660
Don't pull any punches.

00:34.726 --> 00:37.096
Can Lahiri Fertility survive

00:37.163 --> 00:39.365
with my partner taking out half
of his equity?

00:39.431 --> 00:41.133
No.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.002
Damn it, Melville. First you
tell me I can't get a boat

00:43.069 --> 00:44.170
and now this?

00:44.236 --> 00:46.138
There is one bright spot.

00:46.205 --> 00:49.041
Morgan's wedding. Congratulations, son.

00:49.108 --> 00:51.577
Melville, I'd love for you to
join us on this special day.

00:51.643 --> 00:53.345
No. I would never come to that.

00:53.412 --> 00:55.714
Well, what if I told you
I was marrying a black woman?

00:55.781 --> 00:57.783
Who cares? I'm about
to lose my business!

00:57.849 --> 00:59.451
Look, I would've been fine

00:59.518 --> 01:00.953
if my business was getting taken away

01:01.020 --> 01:02.454
because of something
that was my fault...

01:02.521 --> 01:04.123
like a Roger Ailes situation.

01:04.190 --> 01:07.093
Hey. She pinches my ass all
the time, and I love it.

01:07.159 --> 01:10.162
But this just sucks because I
held up my end of the bargain.

01:10.229 --> 01:13.399
I created this amazing company
that helped so many women

01:13.465 --> 01:14.800
and it's all getting screwed up

01:14.866 --> 01:16.568
because of some white man's whims.

01:16.635 --> 01:18.404
That's actually a good point.

01:18.470 --> 01:22.308
Mindy, you remind me of
one of my daughters' friends

01:22.374 --> 01:23.809
whom I don't like that much.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.445
My advice: Find another doctor

01:26.512 --> 01:28.847
to replace Jody's equity position.

01:32.584 --> 01:35.121
They say dogs are a man's best friend.

01:35.187 --> 01:38.390
But they don't say that 40 dogs
are a wife's best friend.

01:38.457 --> 01:41.360
Very true. Morgan has enough
wet breath for one apartment.

01:41.427 --> 01:44.063
So here's the deal. I've
hand-selected a dog

01:44.130 --> 01:47.099
for each of you based on your
appearance and personality.

01:47.166 --> 01:49.201
Wait, what? You think
I look like this joker?

01:49.268 --> 01:51.403
His name is Tiny, and you two
are basically the same.

01:51.470 --> 01:53.305
Morgan, I have to be honest.
I was a initially angry

01:53.372 --> 01:55.607
that you turned this meeting
into a no-kill shelter,

01:55.674 --> 01:58.978
but then you gave me Penelope.
We're in love!

01:59.045 --> 02:02.148
Hey, look! Christie Brinkley
and I have the same hair!

02:02.214 --> 02:03.682
I know. That's why I picked you.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.051
Thank you, Morgan.

02:05.117 --> 02:06.618
Thank you, guys.

02:06.685 --> 02:09.354
Now that Dr. Kimball-Kinney has gone,

02:09.420 --> 02:12.724
I am taking suggestions for
what to do with his office.

02:12.791 --> 02:16.562
Among the front-runners are
wax museum and fart room.

02:16.628 --> 02:17.763
Come on, people!

02:17.829 --> 02:19.398
Honestly, we could use both.

02:19.465 --> 02:22.701
Dr. Reed, I have a message

02:22.768 --> 02:24.971
but I think that I should
tell you privately.

02:25.037 --> 02:26.772
Well, Karen, I can't leave these people.

02:26.838 --> 02:28.507
It'll be like
"Lord of the Flies" in seconds.

02:28.574 --> 02:30.876
And I can tell that Morgan
has more dogs to let loose.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.478
That is simply not true, sir. Stop it!

02:32.544 --> 02:36.348
Stop it. Stop, stop.

02:36.415 --> 02:37.849
Give me the message.

02:37.916 --> 02:40.886
Well, I just got a message
that your father

02:40.953 --> 02:42.721
passed away this morning.

02:47.326 --> 02:48.460
Okay. No. Give him space.

02:48.527 --> 02:50.196
Clearly, he's devastated.

02:50.262 --> 02:53.232
Karen, get him his calming tea.
It's mostly Klonopin.

02:53.299 --> 02:57.836
No! Get me my celebration tea!

02:57.903 --> 02:59.438
These are tears of joy.

02:59.505 --> 03:01.773
Father was a monster. I'm free!

03:01.840 --> 03:05.377
Come, Penelope.
Let's live life off the leash.

03:28.421 --> 03:29.765
Upon being confronted with

03:29.820 --> 03:32.071
the biggest professional
challenge of her life,

03:32.138 --> 03:35.174
can our plucky heroine beat
the odds one more time

03:35.241 --> 03:39.111
and find a worthy business
partner to save her practice?

03:39.178 --> 03:43.315
I love fertility. I love
putting babies in women.

03:44.550 --> 03:48.154
You sure like color, huh?

03:48.220 --> 03:51.690
I know I'm young and I blush
when I see women naked,

03:51.757 --> 03:53.792
but I can do anything an adult can do,

03:53.859 --> 03:57.329
except drink, fight for my
country, and vote.

04:07.974 --> 04:11.077
So can our heroine save her practice?

04:11.143 --> 04:13.980
The answer: Doubtful.

04:19.517 --> 04:23.422
Hello? When are Jeremy and
Anna coming back from England?

04:23.489 --> 04:24.723
It's been three weeks.

04:24.790 --> 04:26.258
How long can a funeral last?

04:26.325 --> 04:28.260
Three weeks after
Princess Diana's funeral,

04:28.327 --> 04:30.762
I was like, "Ooh, new Spice
Girls album's out. Who Diana?"

04:30.829 --> 04:32.864
Dr. L, we would be honored

04:32.931 --> 04:35.101
if you gave the final toast
at our wedding.

04:35.167 --> 04:38.104
Oh, Morgan, I've dreamed
of speaking at your wedding,

04:38.170 --> 04:39.471
but Tamra doesn't want people to.

04:39.538 --> 04:40.872
She's made that very clear.

04:40.940 --> 04:43.109
No! Dr. L, I want you to speak.

04:43.175 --> 04:45.144
I mean you hired both of us,

04:45.211 --> 04:47.479
and the first thing we bonded
over was how annoying you are.

04:47.546 --> 04:51.450
And you are the headliner, so
it's gotta be hilarious, right?

04:51.517 --> 04:52.851
I want great one-liners

04:52.918 --> 04:53.919
but also some really good two-liners.

04:53.986 --> 04:55.587
I want to cry,

04:55.654 --> 04:57.623
but I also want to learn
something about myself, okay?

04:57.689 --> 05:01.027
Thank you.

05:01.860 --> 05:05.431
Everyone, Jeremy's about to come in!

05:05.497 --> 05:10.036
I just have to warn you
he's different now.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.304
Hello, bruvs. What's going on?

05:12.371 --> 05:14.306
What'd I miss with you lot then?

05:14.373 --> 05:18.044
Oh, my God. Dr. Reed you look
so cool and unprofessional.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.312
You can tell he's not
wearing any underwear!

05:20.379 --> 05:22.114
You know, since my father's death,

05:22.181 --> 05:23.782
I'm free from all his rules.

05:23.849 --> 05:26.318
Wear a suit, talk proper,
wear underwear,

05:26.385 --> 05:28.154
keep your hair its natural color.

05:28.220 --> 05:29.621
Hey, Jeremy, you need to hear this.

05:29.688 --> 05:32.058
You look friggin' awesome.

05:32.124 --> 05:33.792
I love you, girl.

05:33.859 --> 05:36.428
Does this mean we can wear
whatever we want? Bloop!

05:36.495 --> 05:38.998
Well, thanks you know, but the
only opinion that matters to me

05:39.065 --> 05:43.235
is my bird, Anna, and my bird,
Roger. So peace out.

05:43.302 --> 05:47.239
Sure. He's nothing like
the man I fell in love with,

05:47.306 --> 05:50.542
but he's happy.

05:50.609 --> 05:52.711
It's great.

05:55.381 --> 05:58.550
Mindy, thank you for coming
to these appointments.

05:58.617 --> 05:59.952
It's such a comfort.

06:00.019 --> 06:01.720
Your hands are so doughy.

06:01.787 --> 06:04.290
I love squeezing it when I'm nervous.

06:04.356 --> 06:08.427
Okay. But listen, Annette,
I know that you're getting

06:08.494 --> 06:12.764
a mastectomy, and I want you
to feel free to use my breasts

06:12.831 --> 06:14.500
as a model for the reconstruction.

06:14.566 --> 06:16.535
You can take photos, you can
feel them. Feel them now.

06:16.602 --> 06:17.936
They're your best feature!

06:18.004 --> 06:19.738
Oh, Ma, cut it out. No, no, no.

06:19.805 --> 06:21.107
we're not gonna do a show and
tell in front of everybody.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.841
Danny, they're... okay.

06:22.908 --> 06:24.910
Get one of those mints you like so much.

06:24.977 --> 06:29.115
Wow. Look at all these babies you made.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.117
You're like Wilt Chamberlain.

06:31.183 --> 06:33.619
I know. And to think in two
months this will probably be

06:33.685 --> 06:36.622
the offices of some
diet pill pyramid scheme.

06:36.688 --> 06:39.225
What? You're closing down?
You run out of money?

06:39.291 --> 06:41.427
Well, no wonder. Look at that couch.

06:41.493 --> 06:43.895
Too many pillows. You got to
throw them off to sit down.

06:43.963 --> 06:45.197
Don't get me started on the bowl

06:45.264 --> 06:46.665
of glass marbles over there.

06:46.732 --> 06:47.967
Danny, I didn't run out of money

06:48.034 --> 06:49.768
because of the pillows I bought.

06:49.835 --> 06:52.638
Jody left to follow his dreams
and he took out his equity.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.673
And I don't have enough money
to keep the place afloat,

06:54.740 --> 06:56.308
so I have to sell it.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.277
Well, that's great.
Now you'll have extra time

06:58.344 --> 07:00.179
so you can teach your kid some manners.

07:00.246 --> 07:02.448
Yesterday, Leo told me I was old.

07:02.514 --> 07:04.850
Okay. I got a news flash
for you. You are old.

07:04.916 --> 07:06.585
I'm basically 50.

07:06.652 --> 07:08.420
Yeah, but we go to the movies
and you get $4 discounts.

07:08.487 --> 07:10.189
I'm smart.

07:10.256 --> 07:12.491
Of course I do that. I've been
doing that since I was 30.

07:18.264 --> 07:21.033
Dr. Choi, thank you so much
for meeting with us.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.435
Ma, this is the best anesthesiologist

07:23.502 --> 07:25.404
in the city. Half-Asian, half-Jewish.

07:25.471 --> 07:27.406
I mean, can you imagine a better doctor?

07:27.473 --> 07:31.310
Asian and Jewish? That's a
lot of new years to celebrate.

07:32.878 --> 07:34.546
I trust him. You're in good hands, Ma.

07:34.613 --> 07:36.448
Actually, I don't think I can
fit you into my schedule.

07:36.515 --> 07:38.784
I've been so busy since I was
featured in "Snooze,"

07:38.850 --> 07:40.752
the magazine for anesthesiologists.

07:40.819 --> 07:43.122
Come on, Clarence.
We've all been in a magazine.

07:43.189 --> 07:44.690
I had my photo in "US Weekly."

07:44.756 --> 07:46.592
I was picking my nose
behind Margot Robbie.

07:46.658 --> 07:49.061
I'm sorry. I just have a lot
of prominent clients

07:49.128 --> 07:50.662
that need my attention these days.

07:50.729 --> 07:52.531
Oh. Prominent clients, huh?

07:52.598 --> 07:54.900
You got really fancy since med school,

07:54.967 --> 07:56.335
'cause I remember holding
your ponytail back

07:56.402 --> 07:57.769
when you puked on Halloween.

07:57.836 --> 07:59.571
I don't remember it that way.

07:59.638 --> 08:02.374
Hey, Clarence. This is my
son's only white grandmother.

08:02.441 --> 08:05.611
She means a lot to me.
So you're gonna do her surgery,

08:05.677 --> 08:07.013
or I'm gonna post the video

08:07.079 --> 08:08.380
of you doing your swing dance routine

08:08.447 --> 08:09.615
from the med school talent show.

08:09.681 --> 08:11.317
No. You wouldn't.

08:11.383 --> 08:14.086
Oh, yes, I would.
And it's a real zoot suit riot.

08:14.153 --> 08:17.356
Okay, fine. I'll do your surgery.

08:17.423 --> 08:19.925
Someone else will just have to
treat the triplets

08:19.992 --> 08:21.360
that play Ryan Seacrest.

08:21.427 --> 08:24.263
- Thank you, Dr. Choi.
- That's good.

08:24.330 --> 08:27.099
So Saturday's the surgery.
Ma wants you to be there.

08:27.166 --> 08:29.201
Richie's gonna be late.
He's gonna be hungover.

08:29.268 --> 08:30.702
It's leather pride weekend.

08:30.769 --> 08:33.205
Okay. Saturday's also Morgan's wedding

08:33.272 --> 08:35.041
and I think he might kill himself

08:35.107 --> 08:36.308
if both of us aren't there.

08:36.375 --> 08:38.309
But don't worry. I have a plan.

08:38.376 --> 08:40.111
I'm gonna go to the wedding.
Dot is gonna take care of Leo,

08:40.179 --> 08:41.913
so that you and Richie
can be with your mom.

08:41.981 --> 08:44.049
And I already talked to Dr. Richlin

08:44.116 --> 08:45.684
and I made sure that
they're playing Perry Como

08:45.751 --> 08:46.852
when she goes to sleep.

08:46.918 --> 08:50.456
Wow. Thank you.

08:50.522 --> 08:52.558
I'm so grateful you figured
all this out.

08:52.624 --> 08:55.694
Well, honestly, it was nice
to think about something

08:55.761 --> 08:57.429
other than losing my practice.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.431
I just wish you could be there.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.933
Sometimes I feel more nervous than Mom.

09:02.001 --> 09:04.570
Hey, I promise it's gonna be okay.

09:04.636 --> 09:05.837
Yeah.

09:07.206 --> 09:10.276
- Okay.
- Okay, okay. Bye.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.643
Bye.

09:19.435 --> 09:21.880
Hey, Anna. I got a great idea.

09:21.943 --> 09:25.124
Tomorrow why don't you, me, and
Penelope slag off work,

09:25.191 --> 09:26.733
go to the airport, right?

09:26.774 --> 09:29.264
Find the first flight out of
here. Get out of Dodge.

09:29.361 --> 09:32.257
Okay. Well, the first flight
out is to Cincinnati.

09:32.335 --> 09:33.515
You want to go there?

09:33.554 --> 09:35.164
Well, what's the first
international flight?

09:35.218 --> 09:37.720
- Saskatoon.
- Damn it!

09:37.936 --> 09:40.506
The whole point was to get
out of the bleeding rat race,

09:40.572 --> 09:42.041
not be another cog in the wheel.

09:42.108 --> 09:43.575
It's like Pink Floyd said,

09:43.642 --> 09:45.311
"Let's not be another brick
in the wall."

09:45.377 --> 09:46.912
Okay. You're sounding a lot

09:46.979 --> 09:48.614
like a college freshman right now.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.516
Yeah, well, you could be more
supportive of my growth.

09:50.582 --> 09:53.585
Okay. Look. We cannot go to
some random city tomorrow

09:53.652 --> 09:55.187
because we have jobs.

09:55.254 --> 09:57.156
And I am trying to be supportive,

09:57.223 --> 10:00.092
but this just isn't me,

10:00.159 --> 10:02.428
and I feel like it really
isn't you either.

10:02.494 --> 10:03.795
Well, that's where you're wrong, right?

10:03.862 --> 10:05.397
'Cause this is the real me.

10:05.464 --> 10:07.366
And he's been there
the whole time underneath,

10:07.433 --> 10:10.469
yearning to get out. And you
better get used to it, love.

10:10.536 --> 10:13.905
I don't know. I miss the man
I fell in love with.

10:13.973 --> 10:16.375
What...?

10:18.677 --> 10:21.880
I'm missing my best friend's
mastectomy to watch your kid.

10:21.948 --> 10:23.115
You owe me, Lahiri.

10:23.182 --> 10:25.351
I do. Thank you so much, Dot.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.286
And if you could just do me a favor

10:27.353 --> 10:29.621
and not teach my son any ethnic
jokes while I'm gone,

10:29.688 --> 10:31.290
that would be great.

10:31.357 --> 10:32.558
Oh, yeah. God forbid
the kids at school like him.

10:32.624 --> 10:34.560
- Dot.
- I like your dress.

10:34.626 --> 10:36.228
Thank you.

10:36.295 --> 10:37.896
But I hate the bracelet.
You look like a hooker.

10:37.964 --> 10:41.033
Fine. I'll take it off.

10:41.100 --> 10:44.036
Here. Wear this. It's simpler.

10:44.103 --> 10:47.073
Oh. Danny gave this to me.

10:47.139 --> 10:49.341
It actually belonged to his grandmother.

10:49.408 --> 10:50.977
There's something written in it
in Italian,

10:51.043 --> 10:52.278
but I don't know what it is.

10:52.344 --> 10:53.679
I don't wear it very much

10:53.745 --> 10:55.814
because my wrist size fluctuates.

10:55.881 --> 10:57.449
Oh, yeah. I know, I know.

10:57.516 --> 10:59.518
My weight started to yo-yo
when I hit middle age.

10:59.585 --> 11:02.054
What? Middle age? I'm
basically a teen mom.

11:02.121 --> 11:04.223
What are you talking about, Dot?

11:12.798 --> 11:16.268
Oh, hey. This is actually pretty nice,

11:16.335 --> 11:19.871
albeit very segregated.

11:19.938 --> 11:21.273
Hey, where's Jeremy?

11:21.340 --> 11:24.676
Oh, I don't know. Cincinnati maybe.

11:24.743 --> 11:26.979
We're not speaking at the moment.

11:27.046 --> 11:29.315
I can be your date for the day.

11:29.381 --> 11:31.783
Do you have any snacks
in your coat or anything?

11:31.850 --> 11:33.219
I'm really hungry.

11:33.285 --> 11:34.820
Are you saving that seat, Beverly?

11:34.886 --> 11:36.488
I was saving it for my son.

11:36.555 --> 11:38.624
It looks like he's standing me up.

11:38.690 --> 11:40.526
Oh, I'm sorry. That sucks.

11:40.592 --> 11:42.528
I don't blame him. I took the kids

11:42.594 --> 11:44.896
to steal some copper wiring
at a new build.

11:44.964 --> 11:47.399
He wasn't crazy about that.

11:47.466 --> 11:50.902
King James Bible? Did LeBron write this?

11:50.970 --> 11:51.903
Who's that?

11:51.971 --> 11:53.172
Hello, Anna.

11:53.239 --> 11:55.607
Ugh! What happened to you?

11:55.674 --> 11:57.977
- You look terrible.
- Okay.

11:58.044 --> 12:01.547
Jeremy, you look like
your old self again.

12:01.613 --> 12:04.283
Like what I signed up for
when we started dating.

12:04.350 --> 12:06.652
Well, I realized that
by doing the opposite

12:06.718 --> 12:08.254
of what my father would've wanted,

12:08.320 --> 12:09.956
I was still letting him rule my life.

12:10.022 --> 12:12.891
Feels pretty good to be uptight
and repressed again.

12:12.959 --> 12:16.295
Can you sit down?
Your butt's in my face!

12:16.362 --> 12:18.497
All right, Collette. Excuse me.

12:18.564 --> 12:21.167
- Just...
- Oh.

12:21.233 --> 12:23.869
Anna, will you forgive me?

12:23.935 --> 12:25.837
I went through a goth phase
in high school.

12:25.904 --> 12:27.506
It didn't work because I was too pretty,

12:27.573 --> 12:30.042
but I understand the urge.

12:30.109 --> 12:34.713
There was one part about the
new you that was kind of cute.

12:34.780 --> 12:36.983
Oh. Okay.

12:37.049 --> 12:40.953
- There's my rebel.
- Mm.

12:41.020 --> 12:45.291
Excuse me. I personally like
the way that you looked before.

12:45.357 --> 12:47.859
- I liked when he was fat.
- Oh, yeah.

12:47.926 --> 12:50.029
- I can't with these mother...
- What?

12:50.096 --> 12:54.766
Dearly beloved, hi!

12:54.833 --> 12:59.605
I am Louis Tookers,
AKA Cousin Lou Tookers,

12:59.671 --> 13:02.274
FKA Mohammed Rashaad Islam.

13:02.341 --> 13:04.443
What a day of miracles.

13:04.510 --> 13:07.746
My cousin Morgan and Tamra
have found each other.

13:07.813 --> 13:10.382
I mean, Morgan has been
spanking it to her for years,

13:10.449 --> 13:12.018
so the fact that he's marrying her...

13:12.084 --> 13:14.453
Let's just say that doesn't
happen to a Tookers.

13:16.676 --> 13:18.924
If I were to marry Kathy Ireland,

13:18.991 --> 13:20.960
a woman I spank it to you.

13:21.027 --> 13:23.262
Or you, in the front row.

13:23.329 --> 13:26.565
Anyway. Another miracle,
I am here on furlough

13:26.632 --> 13:30.469
after my most recent conviction
for aggravated assault.

13:30.536 --> 13:32.804
I stole an Amtrak train.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.708
It wasn't my fault. I was late for work.

13:42.714 --> 13:46.485
Oh, thank God.
I thought that was my phone.

13:46.552 --> 13:48.587
Hey, can you hold on one second?

13:48.654 --> 13:51.823
I have to take this. I am so
sorry. It's important.

13:51.890 --> 13:54.293
I am so sorry. I'm so sorry.

13:54.360 --> 13:57.663
Anyway, the Koran says
that the role of a wife...

13:59.198 --> 14:01.600
Oh, okay. That is my phone.

14:01.667 --> 14:04.770
What's up? Just chilling with Morgan.

14:04.836 --> 14:06.172
- This might be a few minutes.
- Okay.

14:06.238 --> 14:07.806
Melville, I just interrupted

14:07.873 --> 14:09.875
an interracial wedding for
this. What's going on?

14:09.942 --> 14:12.311
You don't have to sell Lahiri Fertility.

14:12.378 --> 14:14.646
You have an offer from
a surprise investor.

14:14.713 --> 14:17.616
I do? Wait, it's not Mark Cuban is it?

14:17.683 --> 14:19.418
He has a restraining order
out against me.

14:19.485 --> 14:21.820
No, it's Daniel Castellano.

14:28.323 --> 14:29.991
And then there was my jury.

14:30.334 --> 14:33.318
You know who was on this jury?
Eight women, four guys.

14:33.385 --> 14:36.764
And of the four guys,
only one true white.

14:36.868 --> 14:39.604
This is like I always dreamed.

14:43.619 --> 14:45.611
Hey, what's up? How's the wedding going?

14:45.677 --> 14:48.096
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm watching "Access Hollywood."

14:48.142 --> 14:51.155
It's a good one. The cast of "Blue
Bloods" is dishing on the new season.

14:51.217 --> 14:52.640
- They even got Selleck.
- No!

14:52.702 --> 14:54.920
Why did you offer to buy
equity in Lahiri Fertility?

14:54.987 --> 14:57.023
Well, I thought it might
be a good investment.

14:57.089 --> 14:59.891
Okay. I see exactly what is
going on here, Danny.

14:59.959 --> 15:01.460
You want to own a piece of the practice

15:01.527 --> 15:02.861
so that you can control me.

15:02.928 --> 15:04.663
Well, I am not going back to that.

15:04.730 --> 15:06.532
You didn't even want me to
start the business

15:06.598 --> 15:08.567
to begin with, okay?
I'd rather just shut it down.

15:08.634 --> 15:10.202
Look, I get why you would think that,

15:10.269 --> 15:11.403
but let me explain.

15:11.470 --> 15:12.838
You help so many people, Min,

15:12.904 --> 15:15.407
and it hasn't affected you as a mom.

15:15.474 --> 15:19.278
I couldn't see it back then,
but I was wrong.

15:19.345 --> 15:21.981
So you want to help me float
the practice financially

15:22.048 --> 15:24.383
and I can keep doing everything
the way I've been doing it?

15:24.450 --> 15:26.452
Yeah. I don't want to tell
you how to run your business.

15:26.518 --> 15:28.454
I believe in you.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.689
I don't know what to say.

15:30.756 --> 15:34.060
Thank you, Danny.
That is such a generous gift.

15:34.126 --> 15:37.263
Well, I was thinking about it
as more of a loan.

15:37.329 --> 15:38.664
You can pay me back.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.399
I'd prefer not to.

15:40.466 --> 15:41.733
Okay, we can work out the details later.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.169
Selleck's back on. I gotta go.

15:43.235 --> 15:46.505
Okay. Okay. Bye.

15:49.808 --> 15:52.611
This is Uncle Boris,
who's also a hitman.

15:52.678 --> 15:55.647
This is Tamra, my bride. Hello.

15:55.714 --> 15:57.516
- This is table six?
- Mm-hmm.

15:57.583 --> 15:58.850
Why am I at table 28?

15:58.917 --> 16:00.586
You can have my son's seat.

16:00.652 --> 16:02.989
Now I know what it feels
like to be abandoned.

16:03.055 --> 16:05.491
Oh, Bev. I'm really sorry about that,

16:05.557 --> 16:08.060
but I promise you,
I will be great company.

16:08.127 --> 16:09.728
Mom?

16:09.795 --> 16:12.431
Mom, hey! Oh, my God,
I am so sorry we were late.

16:12.498 --> 16:13.865
We missed the ceremony.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.434
I wanted to surprise you with the girls,

16:15.501 --> 16:17.369
but that meant more potty breaks.

16:17.436 --> 16:19.738
Come on over, come on over.

16:19.805 --> 16:23.475
Move it, Dr. L! Some of us
aren't all alone!

16:23.542 --> 16:27.079
Okay.

16:27.146 --> 16:28.714
Hey, I'm David.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.616
Yeah, I know. Remember you
pretended to like me

16:30.682 --> 16:34.253
to meet your estranged mother?

16:34.320 --> 16:36.288
Psst!

16:36.355 --> 16:37.889
- You look beautiful.
- Thanks!

16:37.957 --> 16:39.791
- Amazing dress!
- Thank you!

16:39.858 --> 16:41.693
It's going to even look
better at your assigned table.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.895
We're really trying to
consolidate all the sad people

16:43.963 --> 16:45.764
so we don't bum everyone out.

16:45.831 --> 16:49.368
I don't blame you. And maybe
table 28 isn't that bad.

16:49.435 --> 16:50.902
Mm, that's where you're wrong.

16:50.970 --> 16:52.771
It's all of Tamra's single
loser friends.

16:52.838 --> 16:55.174
It's a real dork-fest. I'm sorry.

16:55.241 --> 16:58.377
- Come on, let's go.
- This is the dork-fest?

16:58.444 --> 17:01.713
Wow. Hello. Hey.

17:01.780 --> 17:04.750
So it's almost speech time.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.785
I'm very excited.
I'm gonna go table to table

17:06.852 --> 17:08.420
and raise everyone's expectations, okay?

17:08.487 --> 17:09.655
Okay, okay. Good-bye.

17:09.721 --> 17:11.190
Hey, you want the bread?

17:11.257 --> 17:12.858
Take the whole thing.
None of us want any.

17:12.924 --> 17:15.962
I would love to eat all of it.

17:18.864 --> 17:21.067
Hi, everyone. I'm Morgan,

17:21.133 --> 17:24.170
Tamra's friend
from the wedding ceremony.

17:24.236 --> 17:26.605
I always thought
the greatest day of my life

17:26.672 --> 17:28.607
was the day I got out of prison.

17:28.674 --> 17:31.143
I was wrong.

17:31.210 --> 17:32.878
It's today.

17:32.945 --> 17:36.215
Because today I got a new cellmate.

17:36.282 --> 17:38.584
And it's a life sentence.

17:38.650 --> 17:40.019
And when this new cellmate says to me,

17:40.086 --> 17:41.720
"Hey, I'm having sex with you,"

17:41.787 --> 17:43.289
you know what I'm going to say?

17:43.355 --> 17:44.991
"Okay."

17:45.057 --> 17:48.560
See, Tam, the problem is
is I wanted to use words

17:48.627 --> 17:52.331
to tell you how I feel about
you but it was just too dirty.

17:52.398 --> 17:55.334
So I had to find a different
way to express myself.

17:55.401 --> 17:59.238
Anatoli, spasibo.

18:01.140 --> 18:03.109

Good job.

19:45.644 --> 19:47.679
All right, everybody.

19:47.746 --> 19:50.082
The Gettysburg Address,

19:50.149 --> 19:52.918
JFK asked not what you could do
for your country,

19:52.985 --> 19:55.321
"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."

19:55.387 --> 19:59.591
All those speeches suck in comparison

19:59.658 --> 20:01.860
to the speech you are about to hear.

20:01.927 --> 20:04.063
She's the person that is
standing between you

20:04.130 --> 20:05.464
and the open bar!

20:05.531 --> 20:08.334
Give it up for Dr. Mindy Lahiri!

20:11.003 --> 20:13.472
They're yours. They're ready!

20:13.539 --> 20:16.842
Thank you, Morgan,
for setting the bar so high.

20:16.908 --> 20:19.545
My name is Dr. Mindy Lahiri.

20:22.214 --> 20:23.983
Oh, I'm so sorry.

20:24.050 --> 20:27.853
I never thought that Tamra and
Morgan would work as a couple.

20:27.919 --> 20:30.489
Tamra is so beautiful and cool,

20:30.556 --> 20:31.991
and frankly far too talented

20:32.058 --> 20:33.725
to work at our practice for very long.

20:33.792 --> 20:37.163
It's true! I've gotten
several offers to leave.

20:37.229 --> 20:40.532
And Morgan is, shall we say,
a bit of a fixer upper.

20:40.599 --> 20:43.269
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said about me.

20:43.335 --> 20:48.340
But what I didn't realize
is how much people can change.

20:48.407 --> 20:51.043
And how much we can help
each other change.

20:51.110 --> 20:54.180
Tamra stopped thinking that
she was better than everyone.

20:54.246 --> 20:56.582
And, Morgan, you've really matured too.

20:56.648 --> 20:58.884
I mean this is a man who
finally moved out

20:58.951 --> 21:00.486
of his grandmother's house.

21:00.552 --> 21:04.056
Oh, my God!
I forgot to invite Grandmother!

21:04.123 --> 21:04.856
Oh, no!

21:04.923 --> 21:06.492
I'm very sorry.

21:06.558 --> 21:10.963
And maybe they weren't right
for each other then,

21:11.030 --> 21:13.332
but somehow they are now.

21:13.399 --> 21:15.801
That's the funny thing
about people changing.

21:15.867 --> 21:18.004
It happens so slowly, you know?

21:18.070 --> 21:23.375
You don't realize a person's
changed until you look at them

21:23.442 --> 21:27.980
and they're not the person
you thought they were.

21:31.883 --> 21:33.719
Does anyone here speak Italian?

21:34.920 --> 21:36.288
Anyone? Anyone?

21:36.355 --> 21:37.823
Io parlo italiano!

21:37.889 --> 21:39.558
I learned some when I spent
a summer in Milan

21:39.625 --> 21:41.060
as an apprentice male seamstress.

21:41.127 --> 21:43.629
Jeremy, what does "correre" mean?

21:43.695 --> 21:47.599
It means "run."

21:47.666 --> 21:49.135
I have to go.

21:49.201 --> 21:52.171
Thank you! Happy wedding!
Enjoy your dinner!

21:53.940 --> 21:57.809
Better than I ever imagined.

21:59.678 --> 22:04.050
Hey! Are you leaving? We
haven't even cut the cake yet!

22:04.116 --> 22:06.218
It's black and white, to
symbolize Tamra and I's

22:06.285 --> 22:07.886
love of chocolate and vanilla.

22:07.954 --> 22:10.356
Morgan, I have to go. I'm so sorry.

22:10.422 --> 22:11.991
I can't explain it.

22:12.058 --> 22:13.625
And I can't even get an Uber
because I've been banned

22:13.692 --> 22:14.893
for talking to the drivers too much.

22:14.961 --> 22:16.295
All right, take my bike.

22:16.362 --> 22:17.964
Maybe I can get a lift with Tamra.

22:18.030 --> 22:20.799
Oh, my God! Thank you so much, Morgan!

22:20.866 --> 22:22.534
Hey, I'm so proud of you.

22:22.601 --> 22:24.103
You did good out there.

22:24.170 --> 22:26.205
Bye!

22:26.272 --> 22:29.041
Be careful!

22:46.192 --> 22:50.829
I don't think so, pool.
Not making that mistake again.

23:12.451 --> 23:14.954
I'm looking for Annette Castellano.

23:15.021 --> 23:17.990
I'm so sorry. You're too late.

23:18.057 --> 23:19.391
Oh, my God.

23:19.458 --> 23:22.161
She's been moved to recovery room B.

23:22.228 --> 23:24.530
You know how that sounded!

23:37.109 --> 23:39.545
- Oh, hey.
- Oh!

23:39.611 --> 23:41.280
What are you doing here?
Why are you out of breath?

23:41.347 --> 23:42.881
Why aren't you at the wedding?

23:42.949 --> 23:44.750
I thought you would be in there.

23:44.816 --> 23:48.620
Nope. I stepped out to pee
and grab some coffee.

23:48.687 --> 23:50.289
Makes sense.

23:50.356 --> 23:52.391
You're wearing
my grandmother's bracelet.

23:52.458 --> 23:56.095
I am, Danny.

23:56.162 --> 23:59.831
"Correre" means run.
And I looked at it...

23:59.898 --> 24:01.533
My grandfather gave it to my grandmother

24:01.600 --> 24:03.102
to get her to run more.

24:03.169 --> 24:07.306
She was 400 pounds.
Disgusting. Come on in.

24:07.373 --> 24:09.541
Hey, look what the cat dragged in.

24:09.608 --> 24:11.343
She's a mess! All sweaty!

24:11.410 --> 24:14.680
I'd offer you a seat, but you'd
probably ruin the couch.

24:14.746 --> 24:17.283
- Hi!
- Hi.

24:17.349 --> 24:22.054
I just wanted to come in
and check up on you.

24:22.121 --> 24:24.123
I was great.

24:24.190 --> 24:28.060
Whatever's in this IV bag, it's amazing!

24:28.127 --> 24:29.795
Danny, maybe you can get me some more

24:29.861 --> 24:30.829
of this some time, eh?

24:30.896 --> 24:32.331
We'll talk about that.

24:32.398 --> 24:33.765
The doctor gave her the all clear.

24:33.832 --> 24:35.234
She's already complaining

24:35.301 --> 24:37.069
the TV commercials are too loud.

24:37.136 --> 24:41.040
Oh, shh! Mindy, it was
so nice that you came.

24:41.107 --> 24:44.643
And you look beautiful in that dress.

24:44.710 --> 24:47.947
Thank you.

24:52.651 --> 24:55.321
Well, we could have texted
you all that, right?

24:55.387 --> 24:59.591
You knucklehead.

24:59.658 --> 25:02.361
He's right.

25:02.428 --> 25:05.731
So everything's good with you.

25:05.797 --> 25:07.766
Everything's good with you.

25:07.833 --> 25:09.801
Everything's good.

25:09.868 --> 25:12.604
Then I'm gonna go. Good-bye.

25:12.671 --> 25:17.743
All right.

25:17.809 --> 25:19.311
That was weird, right?

25:19.378 --> 25:21.280
It's not like her to leave
a wedding early,

25:21.347 --> 25:24.916
unless, I don't know, unless
she's getting escorted out.

25:24.984 --> 25:26.552
- Danny, you're an idiot.
- Mm.

25:26.618 --> 25:28.620
- What?
- I said you're an idiot.

25:28.687 --> 25:31.991
I'm an idiot? You dropped out
of eyebrow threading college.

25:32.058 --> 25:34.526
Oh, you mahmouts! She clearly ran

25:34.593 --> 25:36.095
all the way here from that wedding.

25:36.162 --> 25:39.431
She wasn't here to see me.

25:40.699 --> 25:43.369
- You mean she was here...
- I can't believe this.

25:43.435 --> 25:45.437
I raised you to be more
perceptive than you're being.

25:45.504 --> 25:48.107
It was a romantic gesture, Danny.

25:48.174 --> 25:50.276
It was a romantic gesture.

25:58.617 --> 26:00.352
Sorry about that.

26:00.419 --> 26:02.421
Here, can you hold this for me?

26:02.488 --> 26:03.822
Thank you.

26:43.862 --> 26:45.031
What the hell are you doing?

26:45.097 --> 26:46.865
Nothing. Nothing.

26:46.932 --> 26:50.136
I was hungry 'cause I didn't
have any dinner at the wedding.

26:50.202 --> 26:52.504
So I wanted candy and I got stuck.

26:52.571 --> 26:56.208
The janitors came in.
They laughed at me.

26:56.275 --> 26:57.509
All right. Let me give you a hand.

26:57.576 --> 26:59.278
- I don't...
- You all right?

26:59.345 --> 27:01.280
I don't think it's gonna do anything.

27:01.347 --> 27:02.949
I'll do something. Let me
just get my hand in there.

27:03.015 --> 27:05.051
Okay. Oh! Oh! You got it!

27:05.117 --> 27:06.585
- Yeah, I got it.
- Yeah, you got it.

27:06.652 --> 27:08.487
Oh, thank you.

27:08.554 --> 27:10.756
- Here you go.
- Thanks very much.

27:16.895 --> 27:20.266
It was brought to my attention
that you might

27:20.332 --> 27:22.634
be here to tell me something.

27:22.701 --> 27:25.037
Oh, no. I said what I needed to say.

27:25.104 --> 27:29.108
I wanted to check in on your
mom, get some sour straws,

27:29.175 --> 27:31.710
- and then head home.
- Ah.

27:31.777 --> 27:35.147
Okay, that's... that's what I thought.

27:35.214 --> 27:36.615
Have a great night, okay?

27:36.682 --> 27:39.118
Wait, what did you think
I was gonna say?

27:39.185 --> 27:42.554
Uh...

27:42.621 --> 27:45.491
I don't know.

27:45.557 --> 27:50.997
This is dumb, but I thought
maybe you'd say

27:51.063 --> 27:53.899
that you loved me again,

27:53.966 --> 27:56.368
and that you wanted to try
to make things work.

27:56.435 --> 27:59.005
And if I had said that,
what would you have said?

27:59.071 --> 28:02.241
I would've said that I'd like that.

28:02.308 --> 28:05.111
But I didn't say that.

28:05.177 --> 28:07.146
Well, I really misjudged this.

28:07.213 --> 28:09.815
Sorry.

28:09.881 --> 28:11.383
Have a great night.

28:11.450 --> 28:13.585
I wasn't gonna say
that I loved you again.

28:16.755 --> 28:19.158
I was gonna say that

28:19.225 --> 28:20.592
I never stopped loving you,

28:20.659 --> 28:22.628
and I don't think I ever will.

28:33.872 --> 28:37.676
Hold on a sec, are you gonna
move to Tribeca with me?

28:37.743 --> 28:39.878
Because I'm not moving
to the West Village.

28:39.946 --> 28:41.680
There's too many cupcake shops.

28:41.747 --> 28:45.451
Cup... what? I like the cupcake shops!

28:45.517 --> 28:48.254
All right. The cupcake shops are fine.

28:52.191 --> 28:53.759
Are you gonna change your last name?

28:53.825 --> 28:55.394
'Cause I'm not doing one of
those joint names.

28:55.461 --> 28:57.829
- I'm not doing that.
- I...

28:57.896 --> 29:00.566
Can... can we just watch TV?

29:00.632 --> 29:04.136
We have the rest of our lives to argue.

29:04.203 --> 29:07.306
Yeah.

29:07.373 --> 29:09.408
Yeah, let's watch TV.

29:09.475 --> 29:10.876
What do you want to watch?

29:10.943 --> 29:13.345
Let's see.

29:13.412 --> 29:15.147
- Oh, this is good.
- Yeah?

29:15.214 --> 29:17.783
- Yeah.
- Okay.
