WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:06.174
(laughing)

00:06.207 --> 00:08.176
I was just fixing
Beverly's disposal.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.211
She told me the
funniest joke.

00:10.244 --> 00:11.212
Studying.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.346
What's the difference

00:12.380 --> 00:13.681
between a golf ball
and a G-spot?

00:13.714 --> 00:16.717
A man will never stop looking
for a golf ball.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.719
Hilarious, right?

00:18.752 --> 00:20.821
Men are oafs.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.391
Mom, please,
I've got my LSATs next week.

00:23.424 --> 00:24.692
I've really got to study.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.228
I get it.
Once again, the LSATs are...?

00:27.261 --> 00:29.163
Law School Admissions Test.

00:29.197 --> 00:32.200
Oh, sure, L-S-A-T.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.368
Oh, that's an easy way
to remember it.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.070
Mom!
Sorry, sorry,

00:36.104 --> 00:37.438
I'll just grab a bite
and leave you to it.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.841
(rustling)

00:40.874 --> 00:42.210
Can I just say one thing?

00:42.243 --> 00:43.811
I doubt it.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.579
I am so proud of you.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.348
Thanks.
I mean,
look how far you've come,

00:47.381 --> 00:48.749
from pregnant
high school dropout

00:48.782 --> 00:51.585
to wannabe law school student
in just 22 short years.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.721
23 if you don't shut up.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.556
Sorry.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.425
Quiet as a mouse.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.696
Hey.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.098
It's a carrot.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.299
I can still hear it.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.740
Sorry.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.109
(coughs)

01:15.143 --> 01:16.777
Oh, for God's sake,
just finish it.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.355
Ta-da!

01:29.457 --> 01:31.425
(phone camera clicking)

01:32.826 --> 01:34.128
Now what are you doing?

01:34.162 --> 01:35.763
Capturing a precious memory--

01:35.796 --> 01:39.733
my amazing daughter studying
for... some test.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.735
LSAT. LSAT.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.337
Right, LSAT.
I'm leaving now,

01:43.371 --> 01:46.340
but if you need anything,
let me know.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.608
So proud.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.343
(groans)

01:49.377 --> 01:50.878
Didn't support me for 40 years.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.781
All of a sudden,
we're the Gilmore Girls.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.350
I have to take these again.
You look really angry.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.788
*

02:23.211 --> 02:24.245
Back!

02:24.278 --> 02:26.847
I didn't make a sound.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.849
I can smell
your mustache bleach.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.584
But I'm thirsty.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.220
Get in the shower
and open your mouth.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.923
(knock on door)
But first, get the door.

02:35.956 --> 02:39.460
So tiny and so mean.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.198
Like a Chihuahua.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.233
Hey, baby.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.567
Nope!

02:48.802 --> 02:51.339
Adam's back early!
Stall him for a minute.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.641
A minute?
Have you seen yourself?

02:57.345 --> 02:59.247
Hey, Adam,
when'd you get back?

02:59.280 --> 03:00.314
This morning.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.815
What was I just looking at?

03:01.849 --> 03:05.786
Yeah... you never want to see
how the sausage is made.

03:05.819 --> 03:06.820
(laughs)

03:06.854 --> 03:08.722
So, how was your job?

03:08.756 --> 03:11.292
Ah, the movie's a piece of
crap, but the check cleared,

03:11.325 --> 03:14.662
and I got a picture of The
Rock carrying me like a baby.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.565
Why are both your shirts off?

03:17.598 --> 03:20.301
I don't know, it all
happened so fast.

03:20.334 --> 03:23.704
Uh, listen, there's something
else I wanted to...

03:23.737 --> 03:25.839
Adam, I wish I could talk,
but I'm cramming

03:25.873 --> 03:26.974
for the LSAT
on Thursday.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.743
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

03:29.777 --> 03:32.680
You're making a huge mistake,
but, oh, my God!

03:32.713 --> 03:33.914
You think she'll like it?

03:33.947 --> 03:35.449
Yes, it's beautiful.

03:35.483 --> 03:36.884
I can't believe
you're doing this.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.552
I can't, either.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.721
But six weeks away from your
mother felt like six months.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.357
Turns out I wasn't just saying
"I love you" to get laid.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.659
I am so happy for you guys!
Oh. (laughs)

03:45.693 --> 03:47.561
So, how you gonna ask her?

03:47.595 --> 03:49.463
I thought I'd take her
to the burger shack

03:49.497 --> 03:50.864
where we had our
first official date.

03:50.898 --> 03:54.602
A shack? You are going
to propose to her at a shack?

03:54.635 --> 03:56.904
Uh... "shack"
is misleading.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.906
It's more like a hut.
It's a permanent structure.

03:58.939 --> 04:04.678
Look, this is her first and
hopefully last proposal ever.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.947
This is a moment
she will remember always.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.516
You're starting to
freak me out a little.

04:08.549 --> 04:09.950
Here's what you're gonna do.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.552
There's this restaurant
Spetrino's.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.287
We can't afford it, you can.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.422
You want a table

04:14.455 --> 04:15.956
in the room
with the twinkle lights.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.626
After she finishes the
osso buco, you signal the waiter

04:18.659 --> 04:20.361
to bring over
the Grand Marnier soufflé.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.029
Yeah, but doesn't that...?
The alcohol burns off.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.597
Anyway,

04:23.631 --> 04:26.066
the ring is already hidden
in the soufflé,

04:26.099 --> 04:30.771
and as he comes up to the table,
you get down on one...

04:30.804 --> 04:33.674
You sit where you are
and pop the question.

04:35.443 --> 04:38.045
That's a lot of detail
off the top of your head.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.914
I am loaning you my dream.
Don't mess it up.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.916
BONNIE:
Adam?!

04:42.950 --> 04:45.085
I didn't know you were here.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.720
Enjoy your sausage.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.823
That's a little forward,
but I intend to.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.727
Come on, tell us.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.095
Not until Jill gets here.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.631
But trust me, this is big.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.066
Bonnie and Adam
are getting married.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.635
No. Not even close.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.105
Actually,
before Jill gets here,

05:05.138 --> 05:07.975
I really want to say something
not nice about her,

05:08.008 --> 05:09.743
but it's only 'cause I care.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.612
I think I want to say
the same not-nice thing,

05:11.645 --> 05:12.980
but it's only
'cause I care, too.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.816
Ladies, she's had a
rough couple of months,

05:15.849 --> 05:20.688
and it's not for us to judge
how she is or isn't handling it.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.524
Well, I'm her friend and, damn
it, I'm gonna say something.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.426
Shh, shh. Here she comes.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.328
Hey!

05:29.863 --> 05:33.667
Can I get a strawberry milkshake
over here with one straw?

05:35.436 --> 05:37.471
(sighs)
Scootch over, Wendy.

05:37.505 --> 05:40.774
I thought I did.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.676
So what'd I miss?

05:49.049 --> 05:50.651
Christy?

05:51.719 --> 05:55.889
Well, Jill... as your friend,

05:55.923 --> 05:59.627
um, I think I should
tell you that...

06:07.768 --> 06:09.870
...Adam is proposing
to my mother tonight!

06:09.903 --> 06:11.839
Oh, my God!
MARJORIE:
Wonderful!

06:11.872 --> 06:13.173
Hey, I guessed that!

06:13.206 --> 06:14.742
You want a prize,
go to a carnival.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.746
Bonnie, how you
doing up there?

06:18.779 --> 06:20.981
Our reservation's
at 8:00.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.617
BONNIE:
Relax. It's only 8:15.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.387
So that's what pacing
is for you.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.061
I'm a little nervous.

06:34.094 --> 06:37.531
Just close your eyes and pretend
The Rock is cradling you.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.537
That actually helps.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.041
Hey, why are we schlepping
all the way across town to eat?

06:48.075 --> 06:50.778
Because I heard
Spetrino's is amazing.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.846
Yeah, but we're already late--
nobody's fault--

06:52.880 --> 06:55.916
but, you know, why don't we just
go grab a burger?

06:55.949 --> 06:58.486
A burger?
Christy, she
wants a burger.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.456
Nope, no, no, no.
There will be no burgers.

07:02.490 --> 07:03.757
This wonderful man

07:03.791 --> 07:05.526
was thoughtful enough
to invite you

07:05.559 --> 07:07.194
to a beautiful,
romantic restaurant.

07:07.227 --> 07:10.063
Millions of women would trade
places with you in a minute,

07:10.097 --> 07:12.199
so you are going
to get out there

07:12.232 --> 07:14.468
and have the best damn
night of your life!

07:14.502 --> 07:16.970
Okay, relax.
If it means that much to you.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.941
And while we're out,
may I recommend you

07:20.974 --> 07:22.510
(quietly):
masturbate?

07:30.851 --> 07:32.586
No, I really should study.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.225
(knock on door)

07:38.258 --> 07:39.527
NATASHA:
Christy, open up.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.794
Your mom told me
you're home.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.996
Another reason to hate her.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.535
Natasha, I really
can't talk right now.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.069
And you're in.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.138
I need your help.
My caseworker told me

07:51.171 --> 07:54.274
I can't get my daughter out of
foster care until I get a job.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.976
What the hell am I gonna do?

07:56.009 --> 07:57.545
Get a job?

07:57.578 --> 07:58.612
Doing what?!

07:58.646 --> 08:00.013
And now you're sitting.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.583
Okay, let's see.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.251
What have you done
besides stripping?

08:04.284 --> 08:05.719
I was a coke dealer.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.821
So, sales experience.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.123
My job in rehab was
to clean the toilets.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.860
Maintenance.
But I bribed
other people to do it for me.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.194
Management.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.263
See? You're
gonna be fine.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.498
Now I really
need to study.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.669
Did you see me stand up there?

08:23.236 --> 08:25.305
Well, maybe I can just
go back to stripping.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.307
That club near the
airport is hiring.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.942
Not the nice one.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.545
All right, I will help you
find a job tomorrow.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.547
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

08:33.581 --> 08:34.982
(groans)

08:35.015 --> 08:36.784
I really should've
gone upstairs.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.289
I hope you saved
room for dessert.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.992
I'm eight feet tall;
there's always room.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.694
But first I got to freshen up.

08:46.727 --> 08:47.995
Uh, can't it wait?

08:48.028 --> 08:50.030
FYI, "freshen up" is lady talk
for "tinkle,"

08:50.063 --> 08:52.065
which is baby talk
for "take a whiz."

08:52.099 --> 08:53.934
(chuckles):
Fine, go. It's...

08:56.870 --> 08:59.773
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.250
What the hell is going on?

09:10.283 --> 09:12.319
I think someone put
a ring in the dessert

09:12.352 --> 09:14.988
so he could ask the woman
he loves to marry him.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.323
(laughs)

09:16.356 --> 09:18.025
I think someone is lame.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.964
Oh, my God,
you're the lame guy.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.836
Bonnie Plunkett,
will you marry me?

09:28.869 --> 09:31.772
(laughs)
Yes, Adam, I will marry you.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.342
Excuse me, uh,

09:35.375 --> 09:38.211
I could get you another one,
but it'll take 45 minutes.

09:38.245 --> 09:41.214
No! I want to see the ring.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.817
I'm so sorry
I screwed this up.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.853
Are you kidding? You-you
took a romantic moment

09:45.886 --> 09:47.688
and turned it into
a fire hazard,

09:47.721 --> 09:49.122
and that's why
I love you.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.124
Got it.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.064
Another reason
I love you.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.000
Adam, it's... it's beautiful.

10:01.735 --> 10:04.271
Excuse me. I'm over 50,

10:04.304 --> 10:06.606
and a man is putting a ring
on my finger. Nothing?

10:07.841 --> 10:10.277
(both laughing)

10:10.310 --> 10:13.681
I am gonna make you
the best wife.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.816
(laughs)
I mean, I'm gonna try.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.286
I think I can do it.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.121
I want to do it.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.656
Can I do it?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.124
Of course you can.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.659
Yeah, you're right,
you're right, I can do it.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.327
I mean, if I can do sober,
I can do marriage.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.896
(both laugh)

10:28.929 --> 10:31.098
Of course I have to go
to meetings to stay sober.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.000
There's no, you know,
marriage meetings,

10:33.033 --> 10:34.735
unless you're
in counseling, and...

10:34.768 --> 10:36.403
Uh-oh, I guess
we're gonna need counseling.

10:36.436 --> 10:37.805
(laughs)

10:37.838 --> 10:39.272
And between drunkie
and the wheelchair,

10:39.306 --> 10:41.809
I think we know who
the shrink's gonna side with.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.110
What's happening?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.312
What's happening is
this ring comes with

10:45.345 --> 10:47.681
expectations
and responsibilities.

10:47.715 --> 10:50.684
And if history teaches us
anything, that's not my bag!

10:50.718 --> 10:52.753
I mean, one night, you're
gonna come home for meat loaf,

10:52.786 --> 10:53.987
'cause Tuesday's
meat loaf night.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.188
Instead, you're gonna
find me face down

10:55.222 --> 10:57.457
on the linoleum
with a needle in my arm!

10:57.490 --> 10:58.859
Bonnie, breathe.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.293
I can't.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.763
(grunts)
Can't breathe.

11:02.796 --> 11:06.166
Can't make meat loaf.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.736
Can't... do this.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.270
Still got to pee.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.939
(grunts)

11:13.774 --> 11:15.675
Looks like you dodged
a bullet there.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.818
I mean, he's the best thing
that ever happened to me,

11:24.852 --> 11:26.987
but all these fears
just came out of nowhere.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.856
It just took me by surprise.

11:28.889 --> 11:29.923
I mean...

11:31.524 --> 11:32.960
Are you sleeping?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.194
Trying!

11:34.227 --> 11:35.462
Hey, you know,
part of this is on you.

11:35.495 --> 11:36.964
You knew he was gonna propose.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.365
You could've given me
a heads-up.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.467
You're right, I'm to blame.
Good night.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.335
(scoffs)
So that's it?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.471
You're just gonna abandon me
in my hour of need.

11:44.504 --> 11:47.775
And you abandoned me
when I was seven; we're even.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.910
Hey. You were an honorary
fireman for a weekend.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.478
Not all kids get that.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.413
Mom, do you want
to marry Adam?

11:53.446 --> 11:55.015
Of course I do.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.383
So call him and apologize.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.085
(sighs)
Gee, I don't know.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.920
Then we start the marriage
with me in the hole.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.022
Good night.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.491
Good night.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.526
By the way, was that
restaurant your idea?
Yeah.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.928
It was pretty good.
Uh-huh.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.496
If you ever go,
try the osso buco.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.431
They give you this tiny little
fork, you can dig the marrow...

12:11.464 --> 12:13.934
I don't care!
I got to get some sleep!

12:13.967 --> 12:17.004
Sorry. It's not like you have
anyone to take you.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.909
Thank you so much for
coming with me today.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.376
Happy to do it.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.912
I'm supposed to be
studying for a test

12:24.945 --> 12:26.113
that will determine
the rest of my life,

12:26.146 --> 12:27.314
but I'm happy to do it.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.785
Oh, my God. Do I even
want to work here?

12:31.819 --> 12:33.253
I mean, look what
I got to wear.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.988
Brown polyester
and grandma shoes.

12:35.022 --> 12:38.391
Hey, don't knock
comfortable footwear.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.960
If I could've stripped
in these babies,

12:39.993 --> 12:41.461
I would've lasted
five more years.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.531
Stop eating sugar.

12:44.564 --> 12:45.565
But I need it.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.467
No, you don't.

12:47.500 --> 12:51.004
Look, it's perfectly natural
to feel scared right now.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.305
I'm not scared.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.207
You should be.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.109
40 is in your rearview mirror,

12:56.143 --> 12:58.145
your kid's in foster care
but you can't get her back

12:58.178 --> 12:59.579
until you get a legit job,

12:59.612 --> 13:01.548
and you're only qualified
to sell cocaine

13:01.581 --> 13:03.550
and ruin some guy's pants.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.453
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.221
Oh, my God.
I can't do this.
No, no, no.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.290
Nobody likes a sad waitress.
Trust me, I know.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.558
Have some sugar.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.926
(crying):
No.
Sweet'N Low?

13:12.960 --> 13:13.927
No.
Grape jelly?

13:13.961 --> 13:15.095
What-what's the point?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.229
I've screwed my
life up so much

13:16.263 --> 13:17.931
I'll never get it
back together.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.299
(sobbing)

13:19.332 --> 13:21.268
Uh, I'm supposed to interview
Natasha?

13:21.301 --> 13:23.904
And here she is.

13:23.937 --> 13:27.107
Your new waitress, hostess
or bus person.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.042
Is everything okay?

13:29.076 --> 13:31.344
Yeah. She's just
a little overwhelmed.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.246
But let me
tell you, Kenny,

13:33.280 --> 13:37.250
uh, it has always been
a dream of hers to work here.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.853
(sobbing):
Hi, Kenny.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.855
In fact, she and I
were just talking about

13:41.889 --> 13:43.590
how places like Uncle Freddy's

13:43.623 --> 13:46.359
have always been the backbone
of American family life.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.897
Well, we do pride ourselves
on big portions for big people.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.065
I just want to die, Kenny.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.500
(sobbing)

13:53.533 --> 13:55.035
Look at that hustle.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.937
Imagine when she has
the right shoes.

13:56.970 --> 14:01.041
Okay, Kenny. We, uh, we look
forward to hearing from you.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.510
Wait, Natasha!
That's not my car!

14:06.046 --> 14:08.481
(knocking on door)

14:08.515 --> 14:10.150
Adam, I...

14:10.183 --> 14:11.618
Nope.

14:11.651 --> 14:15.455
Okay. That answers the question
"Are you still mad?"

14:15.488 --> 14:19.259
Fortunately, I have a
key for such occasions.

14:20.427 --> 14:24.932
(sighs)
I am so sorry.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.300
You just caught me off guard.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.236
Please, ask me again.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.503
Bonnie, it's okay.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.339
We don't have to get married.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.641
You can humiliate me
as my girlfriend.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.243
No. I love you,

14:36.276 --> 14:38.545
and I want to humiliate you
as your wife.

14:40.113 --> 14:43.951
(sighs) Honey, I swear,
if I had a time machine,

14:43.984 --> 14:46.119
I would go back
and make it right.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.488
Really? That's what you'd use
a time machine for?

14:48.521 --> 14:51.258
I might also make
a few sports bets.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.093
Maybe the Cubs.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.095
You wouldn't prevent this?

14:55.128 --> 14:57.430
Look, if and when I get
the time machine,

14:57.464 --> 14:59.132
we can make a list.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.370
Please, ask me
to marry you again.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.172
(chuckles)

15:05.205 --> 15:06.606
All right, fine.
Bonnie, will you marry...

15:06.639 --> 15:08.008
No, no.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.577
The long version
with all the nice stuff.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.547
(sighs)

15:14.581 --> 15:17.617
Bonnie, I love you.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.052
I love you, too.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.388
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.290
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you, too.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.591
Will you marry me?
No.

15:27.327 --> 15:30.463
I told my mouth to say yes,
but "no" just came flying out.

15:30.497 --> 15:31.398
What did Adam do?

15:31.431 --> 15:34.267
He rolled over my foot.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.369
And you know what?
I deserved it.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.438
I am the worst
person in the world.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.007
Well, you do tend to...
Well, to be fair...

15:40.040 --> 15:41.108
Bup, bup, bup,
bup, bup, bup, bup.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.411
No, you're not.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.546
What did Christy say?
She doesn't know.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.481
She's out helping
Natasha find a job.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.083
Oh.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.052
Isn't that great?

15:52.085 --> 15:54.287
She gets a job,
gets her kid back,

15:54.321 --> 15:57.624
and I'm stuck all alone
in an empty house again.

15:59.792 --> 16:04.397
Everybody gets a fairy tale
ending except for me.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.066
I want a fairy
tale ending.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.601
(sighs)
Are you sure about that?

16:08.635 --> 16:10.470
Maybe you keep saying no

16:10.503 --> 16:13.273
because you've been
a horrible person for so long

16:13.306 --> 16:15.075
you think you're not
good enough for Adam.

16:15.108 --> 16:19.512
Well, that would explain why
I've been sabotaging myself.

16:19.546 --> 16:22.215
You should tell Adam that.

16:22.249 --> 16:24.617
Is he still
speaking to you?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.586
Oh, hell no.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.389
But, uh, I might
have a work-around.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.661
(panting)

16:34.694 --> 16:36.596
Apology accepted.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.166
But wait, there's more.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.068
(panting)

16:41.101 --> 16:43.636
Was that the tenth one?
Do I get the next one free?

16:43.670 --> 16:48.108
You are gonna be getting it free
for a lifetime.

16:49.676 --> 16:53.280
Adam Ulysses Janikowski.
Not my middle name.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.648
See? There's still things we get
to learn about each other.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.818
All I know is that I love you

16:58.851 --> 17:02.355
more than anything in the world,
so please marry me.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.258
Ah, you are a piece
of work, but yes.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.127
Yes, I will marry you.
(laughs)

17:09.229 --> 17:11.531
(both sigh)

17:11.564 --> 17:14.301
(chuckles) Oh, my God.
We're really doing this.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.503
Together forever.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.505
(sighs)

17:18.538 --> 17:20.207
Yay.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.747
(door closes)

17:27.780 --> 17:31.651
You are looking at
the biggest idiot on the planet.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.120
Yep, there you are.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.355
Look what I did.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.656
You said yes?

17:36.689 --> 17:38.691
Don't make me relive it.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.593
Okay.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.229
I love him so much.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.696
Why don't I want
to marry him?

17:43.730 --> 17:46.333
(sighs)
Because deep down inside

17:46.366 --> 17:48.101
you think
you're not good enough?

17:48.135 --> 17:49.336
Nah, that's what
Marjorie said.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.870
(blows raspberries)

17:50.903 --> 17:52.572
Mom, what are you afraid of?

17:52.605 --> 17:54.274
Evil clowns.

17:54.307 --> 17:57.110
Scratch that--
all clowns.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.846
Being married to the same guy
for the rest of my life.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.615
Why don't you approach marriage
like you do staying sober?

18:02.649 --> 18:04.617
You know? One day at a time.

18:04.651 --> 18:08.121
Wow. That's not bad.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.689
Have you guys
set a date?
No.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.424
Then what are you worried about?

18:11.458 --> 18:13.860
You can keep this engagement up
for years.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.296
Say more.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.765
Think about it.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.734
When has a man ever pushed
for a wedding date?

18:21.768 --> 18:24.637
It's like a woman
initiating butt stuff.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.876
If you don't bring it up,
then he won't.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.578
That's brilliant.
Mm-hmm.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.413
I'm also gaining
a little insight

18:33.446 --> 18:35.415
as to why you're
still single.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.817
And I'm gaining insight

18:37.850 --> 18:39.919
as to why Adam
proposed three times.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.155
(chuckles)

18:42.189 --> 18:43.623
Bottom line...
Bad choice.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.725
In conclusion...

18:45.758 --> 18:47.827
you're saying I could
just buy bridal magazines,

18:47.860 --> 18:50.163
wear my pretty ring
and run the clock out?

18:50.197 --> 18:51.664
Congratulations.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.400
You're never getting married!

18:59.406 --> 19:00.907
Oh, Bonnie, it's beautiful.

19:00.940 --> 19:05.178
Two carat solitaire,
a bit cloudy.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.514
This might not be from a mall.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.815
I'm so jealous.

19:08.848 --> 19:09.916
Mission accomplished.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.919
So when's the big day?

19:12.952 --> 19:14.621
June 19th.
Mm.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.155
Year to be determined.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.529
Ah! Guys, you'll never
believe it.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.697
Guess who got an average score
on her LSAT?

19:24.731 --> 19:25.832
(all cheering)

19:25.865 --> 19:27.767
So congratulations
are in order?

19:27.800 --> 19:30.937
Yes. Now I can get into the best
of the low level law schools.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.540
Oh. I'm so proud of you.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.542
I always knew you
could barely do it.

19:35.575 --> 19:38.177
Aw, thanks, Mom. You were
always barely there for me.

19:39.712 --> 19:43.450
Well, isn't this all
balloons and confetti?

19:44.584 --> 19:46.386
You got a big career
ahead of you,

19:46.419 --> 19:48.855
you have a fiancé,
you got a husband.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.492
What do I have?

19:52.525 --> 19:55.228
Oh, quit your bitching,
you selfish, pampered princess.

19:55.262 --> 19:58.398
What?
You got a purse that costs
more than my car.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.700
You sleep till noon
because you don't have to work.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.002
On top of that, you got
your hairdresser, manicurist,

20:03.035 --> 20:05.438
masseuse, all coming
to your house.

20:05.472 --> 20:07.840
You know who comes
to my house, Jill? Nobody.

20:09.442 --> 20:12.245
Not even the delivery boy
from Golden Dragon.

20:12.279 --> 20:14.347
I got to walk down
four flights of stairs

20:14.381 --> 20:16.549
to get my kung pao
freakin' chicken!

20:17.750 --> 20:18.851
So the next time I hear you

20:18.885 --> 20:20.287
feeling sorry for yourself,

20:20.320 --> 20:22.322
I'm gonna smack you so hard

20:22.355 --> 20:24.357
your lip filler's
gonna come out your ear!

20:30.763 --> 20:32.565
You want some pie?

20:35.368 --> 20:36.869
You all finished here?

20:36.903 --> 20:39.038
I think we need a minute.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.041
Well, hurry up.
My feet are killing me.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.910
Oh, I forgot
to tell you.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.612
I got Natasha a job.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.647
Oh, that's so nice.
