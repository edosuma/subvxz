WEBVTT

00:01.209 --> 00:02.919
(debris clattering)

00:03.003 --> 00:06.047
MAN: Go down this way!
Get that beam moved out of the way!

00:06.131 --> 00:08.299
-(chains clanging)
-(debris rumbling)

00:09.175 --> 00:10.760
On three!

00:10.844 --> 00:14.014
-One, two, three!
-(crashes)

00:14.681 --> 00:16.391
MAN 2: There may be bodies down there.

00:17.976 --> 00:19.602
(weakly) They've come, Bill.

00:22.313 --> 00:23.481
They're here.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.067
(chuckles weakly)

00:26.151 --> 00:29.154
(men clamoring)

00:29.237 --> 00:30.697
Thank you, my friend.

00:30.780 --> 00:33.283
(hammer thudding)

00:33.366 --> 00:35.910
I'll never forget what you did for me.

00:35.994 --> 00:39.914
-(chains clanging)
-(rattling)

00:41.374 --> 00:42.834
Oh, my God.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.962
Pair of patrolmen
from the Heights found the car.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.297
Totally stripped.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.214
Being good cops,

00:48.298 --> 00:50.925
they checked the engine block,
found a serial number.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.261
Turned out to be
Lieutenant Hunter's vehicle.

00:53.553 --> 00:57.223
Area search revealed the cave-in
and the rescue work began immediately.

00:57.515 --> 00:58.808
What was he doing down there?

00:59.225 --> 01:02.103
Some sort of Indian burial ground
under his friend's house.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.480
I don't know,
they were excavating or something.

01:03.563 --> 01:04.731
When can we see him, Sarge?

01:04.814 --> 01:06.733
Uh, they got limited visiting hours
starting at 10:00.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.568
The hospital says he came through
with flying colors.

01:08.651 --> 01:09.736
J.D.: All right.

01:09.819 --> 01:12.238
Always knew the lieutenant
made of strong stuff.

01:12.322 --> 01:15.492
Eleven days in the dark,
with a moldy corpse next to you?

01:15.575 --> 01:18.078
-(shudders)
-Okay, enough of the good news, huh?

01:19.037 --> 01:23.374
Item six, guys, two more
gang stabbings last night.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.376
Lieutenant Goldblume's
got some additional information.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.671
Hey, Lieutenant, nice work here.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.508
That's right, Lieutenant, I understand
you're a published author now.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.426
Uh, it was just a short story
in the Sunday supplement,

01:33.510 --> 01:35.804
-part of a book I'm trying to write.
-(murmuring)

01:35.887 --> 01:36.888
People, the recent increase...

01:36.971 --> 01:38.223
Oh, give it up, Renko.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.433
There's a couple of two-syllable
words in there.

01:40.517 --> 01:41.392
HENRY: ...clubs.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.938
Enrique Solas of the Gypsy Boys
is gonna marry Lola Martinez,

01:45.021 --> 01:46.731
who's associated with the Diablos.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.067
Is that Jesus Martinez's sister?

01:49.150 --> 01:52.821
Yeah. The big fear is that
this signals a coalition

01:52.904 --> 01:56.074
between the two gangs,
expressly forbidden by treaty.

01:57.200 --> 02:01.663
The Diablos and the Gypsy Boys
both have ample access to the waterfront.

02:02.247 --> 02:08.419
If the Gypsy Boys and the Diablos unite,
Shamrocks can kiss the water goodbye.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.380
NEAL: Meaning they get
cut out of the drug traffic

02:10.463 --> 02:12.382
and everything else
that goes down on the docks.

02:12.465 --> 02:16.261
Yeah. Now, a treaty
disruption this magnitude

02:16.344 --> 02:18.263
will affect all the gangs in the area.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.014
We've got to keep a lid on the situation.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.517
Special patrol assignments
on the duty board.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.520
Everybody, heads up
for gang activity today.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.898
Okay, you all got that, right?
Assignments!

02:29.232 --> 02:32.443
LaRue and Washington,
you're on the Harold White bust,

02:32.527 --> 02:34.237
backed up by Myers and Rowe.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.407
-About time we nailed that creep, huh?
-(murmurs)

02:37.490 --> 02:40.535
Due in court this afternoon
we got Renko, Hill and Lieutenant Buntz.

02:40.702 --> 02:43.329
Okay, guys, last item, one sec.

02:43.413 --> 02:47.792
After three days of men and women
sharing the same john...

02:47.876 --> 02:51.838
-(muttering)
-...today should mark

02:51.921 --> 02:54.632
the grand reopening
of separate facilities.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.260
(cheering, applauding)

02:57.343 --> 02:59.929
LUCY: Thank you for your patience.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.307
You know, we don't mind
riding with you guys,

03:02.390 --> 03:04.893
but thank God we don't have to
shave with you anymore.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.478
-(laughter)
-That's it, get outta here! Roll!

03:07.562 --> 03:09.564
Lieutenant Goldblume, I am shocked

03:09.647 --> 03:12.358
that you would put your signature
on this piece of junk here.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.526
What's the problem, Andy?

03:13.610 --> 03:15.987
"Andy," is it now? You call me Andy
out here out here in public,

03:16.070 --> 03:20.241
while, in this so-called piece of fiction
published for all the world to see,

03:20.325 --> 03:25.496
I am called, "Country Wingo,
a fat cop whose fondness for donuts

03:25.580 --> 03:28.124
had all but completely
eroded his foot speed."

03:28.208 --> 03:30.585
What do you mean by that?
Is that supposed to be funny?

03:30.668 --> 03:32.962
-Meant to be mildly humorous.
-At my expense?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.839
-Wingo's not you.
-Bull!

03:34.923 --> 03:36.758
How am I ever gonna live this down?

03:39.636 --> 03:42.180
-Just the man I wanna see.
-I'm busy, Sid.

03:42.263 --> 03:45.099
No, no, we gotta talk, Norman.
A detective from the Heights

03:45.183 --> 03:49.979
has put in a bid for my services,
at $75 per unit.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.315
Forget it, Sid,
I'm not jacking my prices, all right?

03:52.398 --> 03:53.942
I'm over-vouched on you as it is.

03:54.025 --> 03:57.445
Who's talking about jacking up?
Maybe I'm going to greener pastures.

03:57.528 --> 03:58.947
You snitch for this guy already?

03:59.030 --> 04:01.074
Yeah, sure, but it was day-old.
You got it first.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.201
-Who is this creep?
-What does that matter?

04:03.284 --> 04:05.328
-Come here, bean-brain.
-Ow! Ow!

04:05.411 --> 04:06.913
-Come here.
-Ow, come on! Norm!

04:06.996 --> 04:10.166
It's Benedict from the Polk! Ow!

04:10.250 --> 04:12.502
-(door slams)
-And Norm, don't pull on my hair!

04:12.585 --> 04:14.003
Shut up. Shut up.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.422
I mean, I'm in a situation here,
all right?

04:16.673 --> 04:19.842
I'm happy with you,
but happiness doesn't pay the rent.

04:19.926 --> 04:20.760
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

04:20.843 --> 04:23.972
Well, you still got some boxes
at my place, Sid. I want them out, today.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.682
Wait, wait, wait, no counter-offer?

04:26.057 --> 04:28.309
Sid, what can I do?
When you're hot, you're hot.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.812
Norm, negotiate.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.563
You got tremendous goodwill with me.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.399
You got too big for me, Sid.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.818
Oh, come on, Norm,
I'm not asking for much.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.779
You should see my TV. Everything's green.

04:39.862 --> 04:42.991
Well, talk to your buddy, Benedict, huh?

04:43.074 --> 04:44.158
(Sid sighs)

04:44.909 --> 04:48.204
I don't want to go my whole life
without wireless remote.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.624
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:51.708 --> 04:53.084
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:53.167 --> 04:56.879
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:56.963 --> 04:58.464
(sirens wailing)

05:03.803 --> 05:07.223
(theme music playing)

06:23.091 --> 06:24.801
(water running)

06:24.884 --> 06:26.928
MAN 1: Excuse me, Sarge, all clear?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.305
MAN 2: Hey.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.516
Hey, I thought the ladies' room
was gonna reopen today.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.768
-(door closes)
-Oh, come on, blondie, I'm a craftsman.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.228
Yeah, paid by the hour.

06:35.311 --> 06:36.771
You're gonna love it when I'm done.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.815
(exhales) If I live that long.

06:39.148 --> 06:41.484
Oh, Mona Lisa.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.194
With legs. Ooh!

06:43.277 --> 06:46.447
Yo, Frankie. You don't RSVP
my sister's wedding.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.991
I see Mrs. Furillo down the hall,
she don't mention it.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.952
Could cause a strain between us, Frankie.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.537
I didn't know we were invited.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.581
-You don't get an invite?
-Not that I know of.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.834
What's the use of having a secretary?

06:57.917 --> 07:01.003
Frankie, you gotta come.
I laid out two G's for this reception.

07:01.087 --> 07:04.841
Listen, word is that
the Gypsy Boys and Diablos are uniting.

07:04.924 --> 07:09.095
Yo, Frankie, take your toe off the gas.
I'm retired from Diablos club, huh?

07:09.178 --> 07:12.098
I get enough dog-eat-dog
in this paralegal field.

07:12.181 --> 07:15.226
And I've got two gang-related stabbings,
one victim critical.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.229
Frankie, kids need an excuse
for some head-bashing.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.481
All I know is my beautiful little sister's

07:20.565 --> 07:23.276
going to the "Chapel of Love."
Remember that tune?

07:23.359 --> 07:27.321
Jesus, you still have influence.
Talk to the Shamrocks.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.199
Make it clear that this wedding
is a private matter.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.534
I'll see what I can do.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.744
So what do I tell Juanita
about you and Mrs. Furillo?

07:33.828 --> 07:35.705
-We'll try.
-Outstanding.

07:35.788 --> 07:40.334
Marty's 78 Lanes and Billiard Emporium,
Tempe Room, seven o'clock, huh?

07:40.418 --> 07:43.463
I almost forgot,
Lola's got this silver pattern

07:43.546 --> 07:45.506
picked from Paco's Appliance Kingdom, uh,

07:45.590 --> 07:48.259
Number 31, Princes of Egypt.

07:48.676 --> 07:52.180
Kids today, Frankie.
All the forks gotta match, huh.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.348
-Captain.
-Officer Shipman.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.814
Why wasn't I informed earlier?

08:02.190 --> 08:03.608
Chief's decision, not IAD's.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.276
Wants to keep this bottled up
till we're sure.

08:05.359 --> 08:06.569
And now you're sure?

08:06.652 --> 08:07.862
End of the day, we should be.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.073
Chief wants you brought up to speed,
but Captain,

08:11.157 --> 08:14.118
this has to stay confidential
till formal charges are brought.

08:14.785 --> 08:15.661
Let's have it.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.288
(papers rustle)

08:17.371 --> 08:18.539
You know the background.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.959
September, Lieutenant Buntz
recovered a suitcase

08:22.043 --> 08:23.544
containing 80 pounds of cocaine.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.588
Five months later,
it became relevant evidence,

08:25.671 --> 08:28.090
<i>US vs. Manchester,</i>
conspiracy to distribute.

08:28.716 --> 08:32.345
Cocaine was audited March ninth,
day before the hearing and found intact.

08:32.428 --> 08:36.140
But next day, defense counsel
requested independent lab analysis,

08:36.224 --> 08:38.601
turned out a kilo was missing,
street value 20,000.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.436
What makes you so sure it was Buntz?

08:41.103 --> 08:44.023
What about the property case custodian,
lab technicians?

08:44.106 --> 08:45.900
All kinds of people had access.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.068
And we've been over them.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.862
Bank records, polygraphs, all check out.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.740
The only possible break
in the chain of evidence is Buntz.

08:52.823 --> 08:53.866
Have you talked to him?

08:54.408 --> 08:56.786
Chief thought he might run.
Wants us to build a case first.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.079
I can't buy it.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.373
Buntz is too smart
to pull something like that.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.958
-There's more, Captain.
-(papers rustle)

09:02.041 --> 09:04.919
Uh, I can't talk about it yet. Sorry.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.380
-Keep me informed.
-(door opens)

09:07.672 --> 09:08.589
Will do.

09:10.049 --> 09:10.883
(door closes)

09:11.551 --> 09:13.219
(tires screeching)

09:20.977 --> 09:23.187
-Okay, we got it.
-I'll buzz you before we go in.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.397
(car door opens, closes)

09:27.525 --> 09:30.194
(indistinct chatter)

09:30.278 --> 09:32.405
You, uh, been after this guy
a while, huh?

09:32.488 --> 09:33.614
You could say that.

09:33.698 --> 09:37.994
You know, I've been thinking about
going for a gold shield myself.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.287
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

09:40.705 --> 09:45.084
Plainclothes got it all
over this uniform work.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.628
-(chuckles)
-NEAL (over radio): <i>J.D.!</i>

09:49.297 --> 09:51.882
(heart beat thudding)

09:51.966 --> 09:54.552
(gun clicks)

09:54.635 --> 09:58.806
-(clicks)
-(Neal yelling)

09:59.473 --> 10:01.309
You're busted, sucker!

10:01.392 --> 10:03.561
-He was walking down the hall!
-(man grunts)

10:03.644 --> 10:06.689
MYERS: Gun snapped three times
in LaRue's face.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.317
All right, guys, take him.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.443
MAN: Oh, man.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.237
(Neal sighs)

10:13.613 --> 10:15.281
-Hey, look...
-(men chattering)

10:15.364 --> 10:17.825
Hey, hey, you okay, baby? You all right?

10:17.908 --> 10:20.786
Never better. Right as rain.

10:22.788 --> 10:23.748
(plate rattles)

10:23.831 --> 10:25.958
All yours, partner.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.127
I gotta take a load off.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.505
We got a problem, Benedict.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.299
-What?
-You okay, Mike?

10:33.382 --> 10:35.843
He'll call you in a minute if he
needs help with his zipper, all right?

10:35.926 --> 10:37.595
-Look, Buntz--
-No, you look.

10:37.678 --> 10:40.389
One, you don't take another cop's snitch.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.184
Two, you never take my snitch.

10:43.392 --> 10:46.020
Yours? He practically
begged me to put him on.

10:46.103 --> 10:49.065
Hey, hey, this is between you and me,
and what you did stinks.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.859
Look, I talked to Thurston.
I mean, he wanted to make the switch.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.819
He said that you had him
working for nothing.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.279
You're not listening to me, Benedict.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.156
-Hey, get lost.
-Hey, I'm talking to you.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.159
(both grunting)

11:00.242 --> 11:03.663
No, no, your man took the first shot,
Artelli. Ain't that right?

11:03.746 --> 11:06.499
All right, you do whatever
you want with Thurston,

11:06.582 --> 11:09.502
-but you just stay out of my way.
-(Mike groans)

11:11.587 --> 11:12.922
I'm all right.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.134
What's it like, you figure, buried alive?

11:17.218 --> 11:18.886
(indistinct radio chatter)

11:18.969 --> 11:20.054
Green light.

11:24.141 --> 11:28.813
Down in the hole, buddy dies,
starts to rot away...

11:28.896 --> 11:31.273
Ugh! It's like <i>Tales from the Crypt.</i>

11:32.191 --> 11:35.069
White, putrid bones,
reaching out toward ya.

11:35.152 --> 11:38.989
Maybe what saved the lieutenant
was a degree of maturity.

11:39.073 --> 11:42.159
It's a real mental toughness,
that's what he's got.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.829
Beginning Shamrock turf.

11:45.454 --> 11:49.667
A muskrat trapped in a hole like that,
he'll chew off his own leg.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.794
-Will you stop?
-(radio chatter)

11:51.877 --> 11:55.631
WOMAN (on radio): <i>2203, we have a B&amp;E</i>
<i>in progress, Dock Street and Main.</i>

11:57.007 --> 11:59.301
-2203 responding.
-(police siren wails)

11:59.385 --> 12:01.595
Shamrock headquarters.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.222
(tires screeching)

12:05.099 --> 12:08.602
-(people shouting)
-Get outta here! Get outta here!

12:12.106 --> 12:15.276
-(glass breaking)
-(shouting continues)

12:15.359 --> 12:16.819
(people shouting)

12:16.902 --> 12:19.905
(clamoring)

12:21.407 --> 12:23.200
LUCY: Stop it! Stop!

12:23.284 --> 12:24.577
(clamoring continues)

12:24.660 --> 12:26.537
Mr. Martinez, you're under arrest!

12:27.121 --> 12:28.289
Knock it off!

12:29.248 --> 12:30.708
I'm coming in!

12:30.791 --> 12:32.585
(people shouting in Spanish)

12:32.668 --> 12:34.336
-(thuds)
-Knock it off!

12:34.420 --> 12:36.505
LUCY: Open up! Police!

12:36.589 --> 12:39.925
-JESUS: They got my sister in there!
-2203 requesting backup, Main and Dock.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.762
-Would you hold it, Martinez!
-This is Lebanon, man.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.181
Potato-heads snatched my sister!
They took her across the line!

12:46.015 --> 12:48.267
Hey, stop throwing all that junk!

12:48.350 --> 12:50.269
-(police siren wailing)
-(crowd quiets down)

12:50.352 --> 12:53.230
We're gonna napalm the whole neighborhood,
you... (speaks Spanish)

12:53.314 --> 12:56.442
-Shut up, Martinez!
-I'm gonna turn you to hash browns!

12:56.525 --> 12:59.111
I said open it up, will you,
or were coming in!

12:59.195 --> 13:01.197
-MAN: Yeah, open that door!
-(bangs door)

13:01.280 --> 13:03.616
I said we don't got her, man!

13:04.492 --> 13:07.995
Russo, will you go in there, check it out?
Lola Martinez is who we're looking for.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.456
We're gonna crucify you, dude!

13:10.539 --> 13:12.750
Oh, yeah? Yeah, you want a war, man?

13:12.833 --> 13:13.793
-Well, you got one.
-Come on!

13:13.876 --> 13:15.711
Shut up, Martinez, come on!

13:15.795 --> 13:17.922
Get him to the car now.
Everybody else, clear out!

13:18.005 --> 13:20.716
-Everybody!
-I'm not leaving without my sister!

13:20.800 --> 13:22.259
No sign of the sister.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.637
Come on, in the car, Martinez.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.056
You'd better call the police!
'Cause you're all dead.

13:27.139 --> 13:27.973
-All of you!
-Get in the car!

13:29.850 --> 13:31.894
-All of you, hear me? All--
-Get in the car!

13:36.190 --> 13:38.776
Anarchy, Frank.
I mean, all turfs were overrun.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.905
Gypsy kid had his pelvis broken
with a baseball bat.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.115
What happened to Lola Martinez?

13:45.199 --> 13:47.409
She was late
for a wedding rehearsal this morning,

13:47.493 --> 13:48.953
so the Diablos went looking for her.

13:49.036 --> 13:52.081
Say they swear she was driven off
in a car by a Shamrock.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.916
Shamrocks deny everything.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.961
Yo, Furillo. You gotta get Lola back, man.
They're gonna kill her.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.421
I'm telling you, man,
you gotta get her back!

13:59.630 --> 14:02.174
I want a summit,
all warlords in by one o'clock.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.928
I heard what happened.
You all right, J.D.?

14:06.011 --> 14:07.805
Fine, Captain.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.474
-It's my fault, Captain.
-Sounded unavoidable.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.351
He's just a worrywart.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.563
Bullet hasn't been made
with my name on it.

14:15.646 --> 14:19.024
Well, I'd take it easy just the same.
It had to be a traumatic experience.

14:19.984 --> 14:23.737
Would've been a lot more traumatic
if that gun had of gone off.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.119
-Grace.
-(door closes)

14:30.202 --> 14:31.078
Hello, Frank.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.497
-Everything all right?
-Oh, pretty good.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.542
As you can see,
I didn't take my vows as a nun,

14:36.625 --> 14:39.795
but four months ago,
I started a new career.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.048
Field Representative.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.050
Richards Rubber Products.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.052
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.513
Um... automobile tires?

14:51.181 --> 14:52.141
Pull the lever.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.815
Yes, Frank, condoms.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.483
It's been a while.

15:02.151 --> 15:05.029
I'm here to install our machines
in your restrooms.

15:06.363 --> 15:09.408
-You are--
-Your men are opinion voters, Frank.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.661
Authority figures,
who meet hundreds of people a day.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.122
-We want them to spread the word.
-Back up a minute.

15:15.205 --> 15:17.416
(laughs) I'm sorry.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.086
I... I left the convent

15:21.545 --> 15:25.841
because my concept of love
cannot accept vows of chastity.

15:26.508 --> 15:30.304
But when I got out, I found
that love itself is in peril today.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.514
It's the Black Plague all over again.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.683
You're talking about
sexually-transmitted diseases.

15:34.767 --> 15:38.270
Exactly. Fear of human contact
is epidemic.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.565
People are growing afraid
of tenderness, sharing,

15:41.649 --> 15:43.317
passion, of love itself.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.610
This is the solution?

15:44.693 --> 15:47.780
No, it's not the solution,
but it's the best remedy we have so far.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.114
Grace, there are other ways.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.284
Police stations are only the first step.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.204
We want these dispensers
in every city facility,

15:55.287 --> 15:56.872
and from there, who knows.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.416
It's a war, and we don't have
a moment to spare.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.543
How much is this gonna
cost the department?

16:01.627 --> 16:06.715
Nothing. It's free to law enforcement
because our motto is the same as yours...

16:07.049 --> 16:09.009
to protect and serve.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.387
I have the installation order
if you'd like to see it.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.555
-That I won't be necessary.
-Thank you, Frank.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.265
It's good to see you again.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.353
I'll send you a complimentary
rainbow packet.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.230
Bean-brain, huh?

16:21.313 --> 16:22.690
(thumping)

16:22.773 --> 16:24.566
(men muttering)

16:25.776 --> 16:27.736
(thumping continues)

16:27.820 --> 16:29.530
-Yeah, gotta find it.
-Uh-huh.

16:29.613 --> 16:30.489
Every room.

16:30.572 --> 16:32.741
Every room and not find a thing,
that's the way it is.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.293
Alkie, in a cup.

16:44.712 --> 16:45.546
(sighs)

16:45.629 --> 16:48.340
I got something, Norm. <i>Mucho sensitivo.</i>

16:48.424 --> 16:50.426
Maybe worth the bump we talked about.

16:52.886 --> 16:55.264
(scoffs) All right,
I can see you're still peeved.

16:55.347 --> 16:58.183
I'm gonna give you a minute to cool down.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.690
What are you lookin' at?
You got a problem?

17:09.153 --> 17:10.195
Hey, Norm.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.532
If I may say so,
I really think you're overreacting.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.159
I mean, look, I'm a businessman.

17:15.242 --> 17:19.538
I'm just trying to bring you in line
with certain economic realities.

17:24.418 --> 17:27.212
Okay, maybe I did push
a little hard this morning.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.340
I can see that.
I'm big enough to admit my mistakes.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.633
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

17:31.717 --> 17:35.888
This item I'm about to give you,
old price, one-time offer,

17:35.971 --> 17:40.100
never-to-be-repeated-again savings,
take it or leave it, all sales final.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.060
Check, please.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.688
(sighs) Okay, Norm, twist my arm.
This one's a freebie.

17:46.315 --> 17:50.194
While we speak,
cops are trashing your place.

17:51.862 --> 17:52.946
(clears throat)

17:54.031 --> 17:55.324
Okay, fine.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.993
I was there, I saw it.
But it didn't happen.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.038
You don't know me,
I don't know you, we never met.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.539
MAN: That's five-fifty.

18:03.624 --> 18:04.917
(register dings)

18:07.044 --> 18:08.420
Thanks, Norm.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.051
Look, I'm glad you came to your senses.

18:14.134 --> 18:16.720
There were at least
three cops up there, two in uniform.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.431
I believe I signed you
a frequent visitors' pass.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.558
Norm, did you hear what I said?

18:21.975 --> 18:23.727
There's cops sniffing your underwear.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.438
-Come on.
-I'm just trying to help.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.025
How's your color on your TV, Sid?

18:33.654 --> 18:35.739
Listen, I may be late this afternoon.

18:35.823 --> 18:39.159
Doubt they'll get to you anyway,
Lieutenant. First day of testimony.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.245
I got a problem in my apartment.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.750
Howard, how do you feel?

18:46.834 --> 18:49.211
Lucy, I'm touched.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.922
Officer Flaherty, you needn't have come.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.925
TV's calling you
"the cop who wouldn't quit," Lieutenant.

18:55.676 --> 18:58.637
Everyone wants to know when you're gonna
sell your story to Hollywood.

18:59.054 --> 19:03.809
I probably should
pass my experience along.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.937
Frankly, it surpassed the ordinary.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.730
Whew, what, are you kiddin'?

19:08.814 --> 19:12.025
In the dark, nothing to eat
or drink for 11 days?

19:12.484 --> 19:13.986
And the guy who died?

19:14.069 --> 19:15.362
(swallows)

19:15.445 --> 19:16.655
(weakly) Oh, he was a...

19:17.030 --> 19:18.657
He was a wonderful man, Bill.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.412
A true humanist.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.706
Me, personally, I would have freaked out.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.335
-Oh.
-HOWARD: Prunella?

19:31.003 --> 19:32.629
Oh, Howdy.

19:34.590 --> 19:35.799
Prunella.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.010
(chuckles) Beautiful, man.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.636
What?

19:40.596 --> 19:42.764
I feel like I got X-ray eyes, Neal.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.517
I can see things like they really are.

19:46.476 --> 19:47.811
That's cool, babe.

19:48.103 --> 19:51.106
I mean it, man. It's all happening.

19:51.190 --> 19:56.195
Out there, in here, molecules, life...

19:56.445 --> 19:57.696
I feel it.

19:59.781 --> 20:04.244
Uh... let's see how you feel
about our old friend, Leroy Sherman, huh?

20:04.328 --> 20:06.038
You are nuts, Sherman!

20:06.121 --> 20:08.665
Give me my cat, come on.
He wasn't bothering you.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.500
-(tires screeching)
-Come on, man. Back off!

20:10.918 --> 20:12.294
LEROY: I told you to back off!

20:12.711 --> 20:15.005
Look at the cat. I'm tired of you, Tabby.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.966
You're not gonna fool me anymore
with your innocence, man!

20:18.258 --> 20:19.885
-Dig? No way, baby!
-(meows)

20:20.510 --> 20:25.057
Because I got your vibes and I know
who you've been trafficking with!

20:25.432 --> 20:26.808
(purrs)

20:26.892 --> 20:28.602
You're not gonna con Leroy again.

20:28.685 --> 20:31.563
-Hey, hey, hey, Leroy.
-No, no, no, Detective!

20:31.647 --> 20:33.106
-(police siren wailing)
-Don't come one step closer!

20:33.190 --> 20:34.191
Tabby gets it!

20:34.274 --> 20:37.027
Come on, Leroy, put the gun away, man.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.279
-(cat purrs)
-Tabby must die.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.323
-(car door opens, closes)
-He's out this time! Evicted!

20:41.406 --> 20:44.618
-Relax, Mr. Glass.
-But he's got my cat!

20:44.701 --> 20:46.036
Go on, man, do the cat!

20:46.119 --> 20:48.080
Go roll a drunk, will ya?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.541
Leroy. What's happening?

20:51.625 --> 20:52.751
What's happening?

20:53.126 --> 20:56.463
This beast has served time in hell!

20:56.546 --> 20:58.715
He's nuts! Shoot him! Shoot him!

20:58.799 --> 21:00.717
Hey, come on, Leroy, it's just a cat.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.552
Nah. Messages.

21:02.844 --> 21:05.597
-He send me messages through him.
-(purrs)

21:05.681 --> 21:07.140
They tell me terrible things.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.101
Leroy. Look at me.

21:11.019 --> 21:12.312
I understand.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.814
No one understands.

21:14.022 --> 21:16.066
I understand.

21:19.569 --> 21:21.280
(whispering)

21:26.159 --> 21:27.202
(cat purrs)

21:29.162 --> 21:30.831
Oh, man!

21:32.040 --> 21:34.584
(crying) Oh, little Tabby.

21:35.252 --> 21:38.297
LEROY: Thanks, Detective!
I thought I was the only one!

21:38.380 --> 21:39.840
I don't believe this.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.342
What did you say to him?

21:42.426 --> 21:43.593
(car door opens, closes)

21:43.677 --> 21:45.429
It was private, Neal.

21:46.763 --> 21:49.016
(police siren wailing)

21:49.433 --> 21:52.561
Cross the Mau Mau line,
you pay Mau Mau fine.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.563
Emperors cross any line they want.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.189
Gentlemen, you know the drill.

21:56.273 --> 22:00.068
Let's save the scintillating
conversation for downstairs.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.487
-Chief?
-Aha. Our own Shakespeare.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.364
-Well done, Henry.
-Thank you.

22:04.448 --> 22:07.200
I noticed there was no chief
in your story.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.994
You saving him for later chapters?

22:09.077 --> 22:10.203
Yeah, I am.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.331
Love to talk to you about
the characterization sometime.

22:12.414 --> 22:16.043
I know we both want to see
a fair and accurate portrayal.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.589
-Chief.
-Frank, I need a minute.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.924
-I have a gang summit.
-It can wait.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.094
If this is about Lieutenant Buntz--

22:26.178 --> 22:29.222
We'll talk about that after IAD's through.

22:32.392 --> 22:33.226
Frank...

22:34.102 --> 22:35.395
Have you seen Howard Hunter yet?

22:35.479 --> 22:37.689
He was sleeping.
I'm going back this afternoon.

22:37.773 --> 22:40.317
Uh-huh. We have a problem.

22:41.610 --> 22:45.238
Bill Palmer, Hunter's companion who died,

22:46.323 --> 22:49.034
I just got a call from
the medical examiner's office.

22:50.243 --> 22:53.330
Seems like a part of Palmer was...

22:54.081 --> 22:54.915
devoured.

22:56.249 --> 22:57.167
You mean decayed?

22:57.250 --> 22:58.752
No, Frank, I mean devoured.

22:59.419 --> 23:00.921
As in "eaten for lunch."

23:01.755 --> 23:03.173
Not-not a big part.

23:03.256 --> 23:06.343
Just a-a minute portion, here.

23:08.470 --> 23:11.014
-Rats?
-The teeth marks were human.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.850
-My God.
-Exactly.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.686
I'm telling the press
how Howard exemplifies

23:16.770 --> 23:18.855
the highest traditions of the department,

23:19.439 --> 23:22.234
and it turns out
he munched a little flesh.

23:22.317 --> 23:24.820
-Chief--
-I can see the headlines now.

23:25.445 --> 23:28.407
"Head EATer Takes Job Literally."

23:28.698 --> 23:31.076
Chief, I find this
a little hard to believe.

23:31.159 --> 23:32.369
Believe it, Frank.

23:33.453 --> 23:37.916
Thanks to a little high-powered
interference from your chief,

23:37.999 --> 23:40.252
the ME's report is squelched.

23:41.211 --> 23:42.129
Now it's your turn.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.131
Talk to Howard.

23:44.506 --> 23:49.094
Make that pervert realize he's not
to breathe a word of this to anyone.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.388
All right.

23:53.682 --> 23:56.226
If this checks out, poor Howard.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.812
Oh, Frank, spare me.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.151
This whole thing
is driving my prostate nuts.

24:05.193 --> 24:06.153
(door slams)

24:06.236 --> 24:08.029
(telephone ringing)

24:10.115 --> 24:11.199
PATRICK: Hey, Sal.

24:11.867 --> 24:14.202
What are you building,
a bathroom or a new wing?

24:14.703 --> 24:16.538
Everyone cheap-shots the plumber.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.708
Let me tell you something.
You know who the first plumbers were?

24:19.791 --> 24:21.877
-Mm.
-The Romans, that's who.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.670
Yeah? Where are they today?

24:25.088 --> 24:26.673
I'll tell you what it is, man!

24:26.756 --> 24:29.384
Martinez, he got one hand
in the Gypsy Boys

24:29.468 --> 24:32.095
-and the other in the cops.
-(all chattering agreement)

24:32.179 --> 24:34.306
You babies listen and you listen good.

24:34.389 --> 24:37.851
There is no unification between
Los Diablos and the Gypsy Boys.

24:37.934 --> 24:39.769
Oh, yeah, man. We believe you.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.189
We have the word
of the Gypsy Boys and the Diablos

24:42.272 --> 24:44.024
that this wedding is personal.

24:44.107 --> 24:45.942
-That's bull! Bull!
-Hey!

24:46.026 --> 24:48.195
Either my sister gets back soon
or someone's gonna

24:48.278 --> 24:50.489
wear a shade over their heads
and plug it in like a lamp!

24:50.572 --> 24:54.242
-Anybody have his sister?
-Everybody have his sister. (laughs)

24:54.326 --> 24:56.119
I'm gonna shut your ugly mouth!

24:56.203 --> 24:57.454
Knock it off!

24:57.913 --> 25:00.457
You had your say, now let me
tell you what's gonna happen.

25:00.957 --> 25:03.919
Lola Martinez will be safely home
within two hours.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.463
The border incidents will cease.

25:06.963 --> 25:09.341
And this wedding will proceed
without incident.

25:09.424 --> 25:13.553
Or by God, I'll bring this precinct back
to a time most of you never knew!

25:15.722 --> 25:19.643
You won't be able to walk a block
without being spread and read.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.561
Sledgehammers in the middle of the night.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.522
Search warrants in your
girlfriends' faces,

25:23.605 --> 25:25.857
Those of you who don't know me
ask the ones who do.

25:28.109 --> 25:29.152
Lieutenant Goldblume,

25:29.611 --> 25:32.280
make sure Mr. Martinez
gets safely back to his cell,

25:32.864 --> 25:35.367
and these men are safely returned
to their neighborhoods.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.827
(chairs scraping)

25:37.911 --> 25:41.373
(men chattering)

25:41.456 --> 25:43.833
-(telephone ringing)
-Want to tell me what's going on, Captain?

25:43.917 --> 25:46.169
-What are you talking about, Norm?
-Come on, cops toss my place,

25:46.253 --> 25:48.380
you want to pretend it's a freakin' B&amp;E?

25:49.422 --> 25:51.091
So, this is IAD's call, huh?

25:51.174 --> 25:52.259
Inside.

25:53.593 --> 25:56.846
Officer Shipman, I believe
you know Lieutenant Buntz.

25:56.930 --> 25:59.140
All right, come on, what do you got,
Shipman? I want all of it.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.977
The lieutenant says
some officers raided his apartment.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.062
-We had a warrant.
-Your warrant's crap.

26:04.771 --> 26:07.357
There's a kilo of cocaine missing
from the suitcase you recovered.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.776
I was informed
for the first time this morning, Norm.

26:10.026 --> 26:11.861
I don't know anything about it, Captain.

26:12.445 --> 26:15.198
We recovered this tackle box
from the lieutenant's apartment.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.784
Found it behind the motor
in his refrigerator.

26:18.618 --> 26:21.037
Contains $17,000 in cash, mostly 20s,

26:21.121 --> 26:24.457
about a thousand in ten dollar bills.
Right, Lieutenant?

26:25.250 --> 26:26.334
What about it, Norm?

26:35.343 --> 26:36.177
FRANK: Howard?

26:38.680 --> 26:39.598
Frank!

26:40.265 --> 26:42.392
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

26:43.560 --> 26:47.147
I-I understand that I'm to
face the cameras in an hour.

26:47.230 --> 26:49.524
Yeah, I want to talk to you
about that, Howard.

26:49.816 --> 26:50.859
(clears throat)

26:50.942 --> 26:53.445
Uh, the ME's report is in
on Bill Palmer, and, uh...

26:54.362 --> 26:57.324
we may have something
of a public relations problem here.

26:57.907 --> 26:58.742
What?

26:58.825 --> 27:01.369
Howard, I know you've been through
a horrible ordeal.

27:03.079 --> 27:04.080
Uh...

27:04.414 --> 27:06.666
but I have no diplomatic way to put this.

27:09.419 --> 27:10.462
Did you...

27:12.547 --> 27:13.882
eat part of Bill Palmer?

27:15.508 --> 27:16.801
Yes, Frank.

27:17.218 --> 27:19.012
Have you told this to anyone else?

27:21.556 --> 27:23.892
No, it, uh... it hasn't come up.

27:23.975 --> 27:24.809
Good.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.146
Look, I... I have no doubt

27:28.813 --> 27:30.774
you did what you felt was necessary.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.317
Bill and I had a pact.

27:33.193 --> 27:35.987
The one who survived
took the nutrients of the other.

27:36.071 --> 27:38.323
We've suppressed the ME's report,

27:38.406 --> 27:40.992
so you needn't be concerned about
any of this getting out.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.955
Frank, are you suggesting
that I not tell the truth?

27:46.206 --> 27:49.292
I'd leave out the part
about the nutrients.

27:49.376 --> 27:51.127
Heaven's sakes why, man?

27:52.128 --> 27:55.382
To the true survivalist,

27:55.465 --> 27:58.051
every life preserved is a lesson learned.

27:58.134 --> 28:00.261
Trust me, Howard,
people are not going to understand.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.598
Oh. (swallows)

28:04.099 --> 28:07.394
I see, it's that departmental image, huh?

28:08.645 --> 28:10.522
Well, I think if the chief knew--

28:10.605 --> 28:12.857
The chief does know,
and he wants this kept quiet.

28:14.651 --> 28:15.485
Really?

28:15.985 --> 28:17.529
Howard, just do me this favor.

28:18.905 --> 28:21.533
Don't talk to the press
until you've had some more rest,

28:21.616 --> 28:24.369
and-and we've talked this out further.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.246
(sighs)

28:26.830 --> 28:28.248
All right, old sport.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.250
But, you know...

28:31.501 --> 28:35.004
I-I think we just have an honest
difference of opinion here.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.214
Please, Howard?

28:38.007 --> 28:39.008
Understood.

28:42.178 --> 28:43.596
Whew! Hot, huh?

28:43.972 --> 28:45.682
Yeah. A little, I guess.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.019
If it ain't the lucky man.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.605
See you on the street, sucker.
Your warrant's bogus.

28:55.650 --> 28:57.610
Wh-what's he talking about?

28:57.694 --> 28:59.279
Nothing. Just blowing smoke.

28:59.362 --> 29:00.822
Our warrant is solid, man.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.991
I mean, we got that guy,
we nailed him good.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.325
Sure we did, lover.

29:04.409 --> 29:08.288
Guy dry snaps me three times
and walks on some technicality?

29:08.371 --> 29:10.874
No way. No way, man. (panting)

29:11.082 --> 29:12.917
-Are you okay, baby?
-I'm fine.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.628
It's-it's that scum wad
that's in trouble.

29:15.712 --> 29:16.629
That's right.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.548
-I checked the warrant. It's airtight.
-Uh-huh.

29:18.631 --> 29:21.551
Besides, there's no way he's walking on
assault with an intent to commit murder.

29:21.634 --> 29:24.721
-Now, let's go in and testify, all right?
-(breathing deeply)

29:26.806 --> 29:28.558
-J.D.
-Go ahead.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.102
I, uh-- just-- I need another drink.

29:35.648 --> 29:37.400
(water running)

29:39.068 --> 29:40.028
(exhales)

29:43.239 --> 29:46.826
Hey, blondie,
the ladies' room is finished.

29:47.076 --> 29:49.245
I'd be honored to take you
on a personal tour.

29:49.496 --> 29:52.123
Well, thanks, Sal,
but I've had three better offers today

29:52.207 --> 29:55.210
-and they were all from winos.
-Whoa, whoa!

29:56.002 --> 29:57.086
Okay,

29:57.170 --> 29:59.172
-I'm gonna lay my cards on the table.
-Mm-hmm.

29:59.255 --> 30:03.468
North Avenue Seafood Grotto,
7:30 tonight, you and me.

30:04.010 --> 30:07.096
Candlelight, clams and Chianti.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.265
You're kidding.

30:09.599 --> 30:12.352
No, I like making a fool of myself
in the middle of a police station.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.688
Uh, thanks, Sal, but no.

30:15.772 --> 30:17.106
Come on, think about it.

30:18.942 --> 30:19.943
No.

30:20.026 --> 30:21.903
Okay, but I can see you weakening.

30:22.695 --> 30:24.072
You know I'll be back.

30:24.155 --> 30:25.949
Juanita, what took you so long, huh?

30:26.032 --> 30:27.742
-Baby, I'm sorry!
-I've been waiting--

30:27.826 --> 30:30.453
Furillo, I've never waited so long
for bail in my whole life.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.831
-Don't get arrested next time.
-(muttering)

30:36.709 --> 30:39.087
Lola! Lola!

30:39.170 --> 30:42.006
-Oh!
-You're all right! You're all right!

30:42.090 --> 30:45.552
Look! Furillo, she's all right! You!

30:47.512 --> 30:49.055
-You're the scum who took her!
-No!

30:49.138 --> 30:50.515
-You kidnapped my lady!
-(all yelling)

30:50.598 --> 30:52.559
-(glass shatters)
-Get your hands off him!

30:52.642 --> 30:54.769
-Arrest him, Furillo!
-I love him!

30:56.479 --> 30:58.982
-What?
-I-I wasn't kidnapped.

30:59.065 --> 31:01.025
I-I went with Tommy.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.027
Why don't we continue this in my office.

31:12.245 --> 31:13.329
(door closes)

31:24.507 --> 31:25.383
Huh.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.136
How can you say you love a Shamrock?

31:28.219 --> 31:31.180
Look at this. Joey O'Donnell, '81.

31:31.806 --> 31:32.724
It was before I joined.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.018
How long have you two known each other?

31:35.476 --> 31:36.394
Three weeks.

31:36.477 --> 31:38.313
-JESUS: Three weeks?
-Long enough to know.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.565
-Three weeks!
-It just sort of happened.

31:40.648 --> 31:41.900
Well, it's gonna un-happen!

31:42.525 --> 31:44.235
'Cause you're gonna marry
Enrique Suarez, and that's that.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.653
(yells in Spanish)

31:45.737 --> 31:48.364
LOLA: You see, Captain,
I knew I couldn't talk to him!

31:48.448 --> 31:49.782
-Jesus--
-Case closed, Frankie.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.659
-Just talk to--
-Case closed!

31:51.743 --> 31:53.036
LOLA (crying): What do you want to do?

31:53.119 --> 31:56.039
-Do you want to ruin my life?
-I don't want to hear this!

31:56.122 --> 31:59.375
Do you want me to marry
somebody I don't even love?

31:59.834 --> 32:03.379
All you ever do is think about yourself!

32:03.463 --> 32:07.008
What about me? When's it gonna be my turn?

32:07.091 --> 32:09.052
I cooked for you for years!

32:09.135 --> 32:11.971
And I cleaned for you
and all your friends!

32:12.055 --> 32:15.141
And I did everything to take Mama's place!

32:15.224 --> 32:18.311
(sobbing) Come on, I love you.

32:18.770 --> 32:22.398
I love you, Jesus,
please, don't do this to me!

32:22.482 --> 32:24.651
<i>Por favor,</i> Jesus.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.694
(sobbing)

32:29.948 --> 32:31.866
What kind of a brother am I, Frankie?

32:33.117 --> 32:33.993
Look at her.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.996
Look at my beautiful Lola.

32:38.414 --> 32:41.084
She's happy. A Shamrock!

32:41.751 --> 32:42.835
But she's happy.

32:44.045 --> 32:47.382
(speaking Spanish)

32:47.465 --> 32:48.299
It's all right.

32:50.093 --> 32:53.388
(speaks Spanish)

32:53.471 --> 32:55.223
Are you gonna call off the wedding?

32:55.515 --> 32:57.141
A wedding goes on.

32:58.518 --> 32:59.978
(sobs)

33:00.061 --> 33:01.229
JESUS: But with a Shamrock.

33:03.106 --> 33:05.191
-I love you.
<i>-Te amo.</i>

33:11.280 --> 33:13.032
-TOMMY: You're okay, Jesus.
-Yeah, yeah.

33:13.116 --> 33:15.493
-TOMMY: You okay?
-JESUS: Yeah, I'm okay.

33:18.037 --> 33:19.580
You take care of my little sister.

33:19.956 --> 33:20.999
(chuckles)

33:21.082 --> 33:22.917
What the hell, it's paid for, eh?

33:23.001 --> 33:24.627
So, uh...

33:25.253 --> 33:27.130
What kind of jackpot they got me in?

33:27.213 --> 33:29.507
Well, the evidence
is largely circumstantial.

33:31.092 --> 33:34.595
Their trump card is that 17,000 they found
behind the refrigerator.

33:35.221 --> 33:36.889
They can't prove how I got that.

33:36.973 --> 33:39.267
Maybe not, but we need to account for it.

33:39.350 --> 33:40.852
Why, if they can't prove anything?

33:40.935 --> 33:42.478
Come on, Lieutenant, you're a cop.

33:42.979 --> 33:45.982
You got missing dope and a pile of cash
in a suspect's apartment?

33:46.065 --> 33:48.192
-What are you gonna think?
-(sighs)

33:48.276 --> 33:50.028
Right. They'll hang me.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.696
I don't care how you got the money.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.699
But we can't frame a defense
without an explanation for it.

33:55.575 --> 33:57.285
Can't talk about that now.

33:58.244 --> 34:01.080
This is PBA you're talking to, Lieutenant.
I am on your side.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.041
I understand, counselor.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.669
(clears throat)
I'm sorry to waste your time.

34:08.296 --> 34:11.215
Then for the next four days,
Bill recited to me,

34:11.507 --> 34:14.927
with an urgency that I didn't
at first understand,

34:15.011 --> 34:17.055
a fully-realized...

34:17.889 --> 34:21.059
moral philosophy of survivalism.

34:23.603 --> 34:24.896
Then he was gone.

34:24.979 --> 34:27.065
And you were alone. All alone.

34:28.191 --> 34:31.569
Well, not entirely, uh,
for Bill left me a gift.

34:33.362 --> 34:36.032
This is what I was trying to make
Captain Furillo understand.

34:36.115 --> 34:38.242
It's what I wanted to talk to you about.

34:38.701 --> 34:40.453
I'm here, Howdy, I'm here.

34:40.995 --> 34:42.872
Well, Bill told me it was my obligation

34:42.955 --> 34:46.918
to assume his
remaining nutrients for myself.

34:48.961 --> 34:50.463
Howdy, you didn't.

34:50.546 --> 34:53.591
In the morning of the seventh day,
I took Bill at his word.

34:53.674 --> 34:56.052
You consumed human flesh?

34:56.135 --> 34:58.721
Well, I took nutrients. The soul had fled.

35:01.099 --> 35:05.228
Well, what's wrong, my dear?
Surely, you of all people.

35:05.311 --> 35:06.521
Every fortnight,

35:07.355 --> 35:09.607
Jaggawala would enter the jungle.

35:10.650 --> 35:14.779
He would return the next morning
in a strange mood, full of vigor.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.156
The villagers would not tell me
where they went.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.742
They accused me
of being a nagging "boptami."

35:20.284 --> 35:22.078
And so one evening, I followed him.

35:22.912 --> 35:26.415
And I observed the bonfires
of his ceremony.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.586
The sacrifice, the human sacrifice.

35:32.046 --> 35:34.257
And the banquet that followed.

35:34.882 --> 35:36.342
And so I fled to you, Howdy,

35:36.425 --> 35:39.554
only to find that you practice
the same perversion.

35:39.637 --> 35:44.100
Well, no offence, Prunella,
but I assume Jagga's a cannibal.

35:44.183 --> 35:48.062
And this situation is a different matter.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.939
Oh...

35:50.022 --> 35:53.901
Is there no man for me
who can refuse partaking of the flesh?

35:54.610 --> 35:56.863
-Prunella--
-I'm sorry, Howdy.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.116
We are from two different worlds.

36:03.953 --> 36:05.413
(knocking on door)

36:13.921 --> 36:16.048
-Guido.
-Hello, Mary.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.467
-Uh, you got a minute?
-Yeah, come in.

36:19.635 --> 36:22.305
-Place is a mess.
-Ah, it looks fine.

36:22.388 --> 36:24.724
-(baby crying)
-Oh, excuse me.

36:24.807 --> 36:26.809
Tommy, Mommy's here. Mommy's here.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.186
It's okay, it's okay...

36:34.817 --> 36:35.902
Bad dream.

36:37.278 --> 36:38.362
How is the little guy?

36:38.446 --> 36:41.240
Oh, he's great, he's just...
He's great. (laughs)

36:41.616 --> 36:42.450
That's good.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.077
Something's wrong?

36:48.164 --> 36:50.583
I gotta ask you to do something for me.

36:51.584 --> 36:54.295
I wasn't talking to Guido
right after Tommy died.

36:55.254 --> 36:57.381
-'Cause I was mad.
-I remember.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.967
So, I don't know, month or two later,
Guido comes over.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.844
He's got this box full of money.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.804
Says he found it in Tommy's coop.

37:04.555 --> 37:05.765
He's been holding it for me.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.433
Where'd Donahue get the money?

37:08.684 --> 37:10.102
I don't know, Captain.

37:10.895 --> 37:14.398
Considering Tommy's situation,
I knew IAD would impound it.

37:15.274 --> 37:16.943
-FRANK: Go on.
-I was pregnant.

37:17.860 --> 37:19.737
I didn't know it when Tommy died.

37:20.529 --> 37:23.032
And Guido said the money
was for me and the baby.

37:24.492 --> 37:27.620
Uh, a few days later, I called him,
I was scared about keeping the money.

37:27.703 --> 37:31.791
I was afraid I'd spent it on booze.
Just throw it away, you know.

37:33.167 --> 37:35.169
I asked Guido to hold it for me.

37:36.879 --> 37:38.839
(crying) It was Tommy's money, Captain.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.925
Guido he-he was just doing me a favor.

37:41.717 --> 37:43.678
He was Tommy's best friend, you know.

37:44.053 --> 37:46.097
-(telephone ringing)
-(Norman sighs)

37:46.180 --> 37:48.266
-What now, Captain?
-I don't know, Norman.

37:48.349 --> 37:49.850
She was telling the truth.

37:49.934 --> 37:52.561
Board of Rights is gonna have
a hard time believing that.

37:52.770 --> 37:55.982
And even if they buy it,
you're way, way out of policy.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.943
-Don't look good, huh?
-No.

37:59.402 --> 38:00.486
Yeah.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.248
Hello, Peg.

38:13.624 --> 38:16.377
That's right,
it's your no-good brother. Hi.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.631
I was just thinking, uh, that, uh...

38:21.257 --> 38:23.801
it's been a while
since you and Rob were over.

38:23.884 --> 38:26.512
Maybe we could have dinner.

38:28.556 --> 38:31.642
Oh. Let him go to Vegas, huh? (chuckles)

38:32.143 --> 38:34.812
I hope you put a padlock on his wallet.

38:34.895 --> 38:36.731
(chuckles) Yeah.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.817
Uh, well, maybe just-just
me and you then, huh?

38:41.819 --> 38:44.905
Joining him tonight, huh? That's great.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.283
It's great, great that you could get away.

38:48.576 --> 38:49.952
(exhales)

38:52.246 --> 38:53.289
No.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.877
No, I'm not angling for a loan.

38:59.795 --> 39:01.922
Just thinking about my sister, that's all.

39:05.634 --> 39:10.264
Yeah, ring me when you get back.
We'll, uh... set something up.

39:12.016 --> 39:12.850
Bye.

39:22.109 --> 39:23.736
(Frank sighs)

39:24.028 --> 39:25.905
Grace Gardner's latest project.

39:29.575 --> 39:30.451
Interesting.

39:31.327 --> 39:34.205
I understand your story
got a rough reception.

39:34.288 --> 39:37.416
Nothing unexpected.
I suppose I'm a little disappointed.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.211
I was hoping maybe some people
would appreciate the fact

39:40.294 --> 39:41.295
I got it down right.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.633
Hm, being a writer takes
some getting used to, I guess.

39:46.425 --> 39:47.885
Well, at least you're on your way.

39:47.968 --> 39:51.055
-I guess.
-Henry, uh...

39:52.890 --> 39:55.393
Did you have to make the captain so bland?

39:56.227 --> 39:57.603
Just a friendly observation.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.146
I'll keep it in mind, Frank.

40:08.697 --> 40:10.199
Hey, J.D. you all right, man?

40:11.575 --> 40:12.868
(sniffs) Fine.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.871
Day catching up, huh, babe.

40:17.206 --> 40:19.125
A little. Maybe.

40:20.334 --> 40:21.377
Yeah.

40:24.922 --> 40:27.007
(voice shaking)
I was feeling so good there.

40:29.135 --> 40:30.511
You were in shock, babe.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.514
Now, I...

40:33.597 --> 40:34.932
(pills rattle)

40:35.015 --> 40:35.933
I look...

40:37.476 --> 40:38.894
I can't stop him.

40:39.145 --> 40:41.730
Hey. It's a normal reaction, man.

40:42.398 --> 40:45.109
I tried... talking to Peg.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.945
But you know how it is with her.

40:49.572 --> 40:50.656
Then...

40:51.824 --> 40:53.033
(breathes deeply)

40:56.328 --> 40:59.623
(crying) I... I almost died today.

41:02.001 --> 41:05.713
And I don't have anybody to talk to.

41:06.755 --> 41:08.466
(crying)

41:08.549 --> 41:10.843
Hey, come on, babe, come on.
Come on, come on.

41:10.926 --> 41:13.053
(sobbing)

41:15.347 --> 41:16.390
It's all right.

41:17.766 --> 41:19.685
-Hiya, Raymond.
-Good evening, Sergeant.

41:19.935 --> 41:21.228
Evening, Turnbull.

41:22.271 --> 41:24.607
-Hey, Lucy, hi!
-How you doing, Sarge?

41:24.690 --> 41:27.109
Hey, sorry to force you back on roll call.

41:27.193 --> 41:28.736
Oh, no problem there.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.613
They gotta get a permanent
replacement sooner or later.

41:30.696 --> 41:33.449
What it came down to is I just
didn't want to go back on day shift.

41:33.532 --> 41:34.992
I'm so used to nights, you know.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.578
Yeah, well, you gotta do
what's best for you, huh?

41:37.661 --> 41:39.330
-Thanks, hon. Have a good night.
-Sure.

41:39.413 --> 41:41.582
Sergeant Bates. These came for you.

41:41.665 --> 41:42.750
Oh, thanks, Raymond.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.627
Ooh, who's it from, Luce?

41:45.085 --> 41:46.670
That's for me to know and you to find out.

41:46.754 --> 41:48.923
Oh, what do I care, I got a date tonight.

41:49.006 --> 41:50.758
Oh, and I'm real interested.

41:50.966 --> 41:52.343
I'll see you later, Luce.

41:58.849 --> 41:59.850
Raymond.

42:00.392 --> 42:02.686
-MICK: Lieutenant.
-Mick?

42:03.103 --> 42:05.189
Your story, I just read it.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.107
Uh-huh.

42:07.191 --> 42:08.234
It's good.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.694
I mean, I really liked it.

42:10.903 --> 42:13.239
Uh, part of it was sad,
part of it was funny.

42:13.322 --> 42:17.201
I-I don't know, seemed very real to me,
for whatever that's worth to you.

42:18.702 --> 42:21.247
That's worth a lot, Mick. Thanks.

42:21.330 --> 42:22.331
You're welcome.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.251
RAYMOND: Line three for you, Captain.

42:28.671 --> 42:31.048
-Captain Furillo.
-Frank, uh...

42:31.423 --> 42:36.345
I've been thinking about what you said,
how people might not understand.

42:37.513 --> 42:38.472
Uh...

42:39.473 --> 42:41.850
And I agree with you.
I'll not make mention of it.

42:41.934 --> 42:43.352
Oh, I'm glad, Howard.

42:43.435 --> 42:46.272
You sound tired. You deserve a long rest.

42:46.355 --> 42:47.898
Thank you, Frank. (clears throat)

42:48.691 --> 42:50.234
Goodnight.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.403
Dinner, Lieutenant.

42:52.486 --> 42:54.655
We're putting on a high-protein regimen.

42:54.738 --> 42:57.366
Oh. Thank you, nurse.

42:58.409 --> 42:59.577
(door opens, closes)

43:01.036 --> 43:03.247
(sighs deeply)

43:12.089 --> 43:14.425
-(up-tempo music playing)
-(people laughing)

43:14.508 --> 43:17.886
Hey, hey, listen, I pay for chicken wings,
I get chicken wings,

43:17.970 --> 43:20.014
or you ain't gonna have a catering truck
in the morning.

43:20.097 --> 43:23.225
You understand, Mr. LaFontaine? Good.

43:23.851 --> 43:24.977
(coin clangs)

43:26.061 --> 43:28.439
So, how the two Furillo's doing?

43:28.522 --> 43:30.899
-Oh, fine, Jesus.
-Lovely party.

43:30.983 --> 43:33.068
Two G's, but I figure it's worth it, huh?

43:33.152 --> 43:35.195
<i>Oye,</i> Jesus, nice gig!

43:35.279 --> 43:37.114
-Hey!
-Hey.

43:37.197 --> 43:38.240
Hey, this kid's got it easy.

43:38.324 --> 43:41.660
I was their age, I was boosting
a Chevy a day, man.

43:41.910 --> 43:43.078
It was work.

43:43.162 --> 43:45.372
Now they sell some dope
and they buy the car.

43:45.456 --> 43:46.415
They don't earn it.

43:46.498 --> 43:48.751
My little brother,
he don't know the value of work.

43:48.834 --> 43:50.961
Remember how much kids' lunch money
it took to make ends meet?

43:51.045 --> 43:52.338
JESUS: Those days are gone, brother.

43:52.421 --> 43:55.966
-Isn't that Tippi Mocha?
-Damn.

43:56.050 --> 43:57.760
Come in here to make trouble like always.

43:57.843 --> 43:59.470
FRANK: I thought he was in Harrisonville.

43:59.553 --> 44:02.765
Got paroled last week.
You gotta keep up, Frankie.

44:02.848 --> 44:04.058
Excuse me.

44:06.935 --> 44:10.356
Yo, Tippi, why don't you go
park your ugly body outside?

44:10.439 --> 44:13.233
-I like it here.
-Well, you're history, man.

44:13.317 --> 44:15.194
-(clamoring)
-(thudding)

44:15.277 --> 44:17.529
(record scratches)

44:17.613 --> 44:20.240
Come on, Martinez. Just like old times?

44:20.324 --> 44:21.867
FRANK: Tippi, drop the knife!

44:22.701 --> 44:24.244
I can take out this slob.

44:24.328 --> 44:26.205
-FRANK: Drop it, now!
-No, Frank, listen--

44:27.247 --> 44:28.707
TIPPI (gasps): My chest!

44:28.791 --> 44:32.002
(choking) My chest!

44:34.004 --> 44:36.632
-He's stroking out.
-Call the paramedics.

44:37.049 --> 44:39.343
-You're gonna be okay, Tippi.
-(Tippi groans)

44:39.426 --> 44:42.304
That's what you get
for eating so many tacos, you fat toad.

44:42.888 --> 44:44.640
Well, anyways, it's over.

44:47.768 --> 44:50.229
I guess what hurts is it
didn't bother her that much.

44:50.312 --> 44:52.189
(soft music playing)

44:52.272 --> 44:54.692
Well... (chuckles) no big deal.

44:54.942 --> 44:57.152
It is a big deal, Patrick.

44:57.653 --> 44:59.196
Because you reached out.

45:00.489 --> 45:03.575
And even though Officer Russo
didn't respond the way you hoped,

45:04.493 --> 45:06.120
you followed your feelings.

45:06.912 --> 45:08.288
(chuckles) I guess.

45:09.540 --> 45:11.583
I'm glad you suggested this, Grace.

45:12.459 --> 45:14.336
You seem to understand so much.

45:14.795 --> 45:15.671
Do I?

45:17.339 --> 45:18.215
That's funny.

45:20.926 --> 45:23.262
Sometimes, during the last few months,

45:24.012 --> 45:25.931
even I wondered if I was crazy.

45:26.932 --> 45:27.766
What do you mean?

45:28.058 --> 45:30.144
Well, you've got to admit, Patrick,

45:30.602 --> 45:33.480
my life hasn't exactly
followed a conventional path.

45:34.815 --> 45:37.109
But I've come to realize
that it's my path.

45:39.027 --> 45:40.362
And I like my life.

45:40.446 --> 45:43.115
-And how many people can say that?
-Not many.

45:43.615 --> 45:45.743
Sometimes I do feel that...

45:47.161 --> 45:49.705
we're all just trying
to find our way in the dark.

45:50.330 --> 45:51.874
I feel that way, too.

45:59.131 --> 46:00.924
We're both searchers, Patrick.

46:03.469 --> 46:06.388
We could be back at my place
in 20 minutes.

46:09.099 --> 46:09.933
No.

46:13.562 --> 46:14.438
Now.

46:14.897 --> 46:16.523
-(all laughing)
-MAN: Hey, Bob?

46:17.566 --> 46:19.026
Jerry Siegler from St. Paul.

46:19.109 --> 46:20.527
Jerry, how you doing?

46:20.611 --> 46:22.112
Hey, I see we're on the same panel...

46:22.196 --> 46:23.906
(continuing indistinct)

46:25.324 --> 46:27.201
GRACE (laughing): Oh, Patrick!

46:27.284 --> 46:30.120
PATRICK: Grace, Grace.
I-I can't get it open, Grace.

46:30.621 --> 46:32.998
GRACE: Oh, no! No!

46:33.081 --> 46:34.583
PATRICK:
Damn, do we really need this thing?

46:34.666 --> 46:35.501
GRACE: Yes!

46:36.502 --> 46:37.711
(knocks on door)

46:46.637 --> 46:49.097
-(knocking continues)
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, who is it?

46:49.181 --> 46:50.015
SID: It's me, Norm.

46:54.019 --> 46:55.395
(lock clicks)

46:56.313 --> 46:57.564
Hey, Norm.

46:57.898 --> 46:59.650
Am I still persona non gratis?

46:59.900 --> 47:02.236
-Let's go, in or out, Sid.
-I'm in.

47:05.030 --> 47:07.866
And a bottle of rosé.

47:08.909 --> 47:10.494
(Sid chuckles)

47:10.577 --> 47:13.997
And... pistachios.

47:14.081 --> 47:15.374
The big bag, Norm.

47:15.958 --> 47:17.918
For little celebration.

47:18.001 --> 47:19.795
(scoffs) For what?

47:19.878 --> 47:21.505
(rustles)

47:21.588 --> 47:22.422
Norman...

47:23.799 --> 47:25.175
I have decided...

47:26.260 --> 47:29.346
that not everything is
dependent upon the bottom line.

47:30.097 --> 47:33.809
So, even though it's gonna cost me,
and don't I know it...

47:33.892 --> 47:35.394
(bottle opens)

47:35.477 --> 47:38.564
...I have given my notice to Benedict.

47:39.648 --> 47:42.901
-(wine pours)
-This operator works for Norman Buntz.

47:43.360 --> 47:46.113
-Period.
-Terrific.

47:46.196 --> 47:49.491
Oh, come on, Norm.
Give us a little smile, huh?

47:49.575 --> 47:53.620
Look, maybe you can still
patch things up with Benedict.

47:55.038 --> 47:56.456
What are you talking about?

47:57.082 --> 47:59.543
IAD's got my badge and my gun.

48:01.795 --> 48:03.463
I've been suspended.

48:16.018 --> 48:19.021
(closing theme playing)
