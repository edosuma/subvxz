00:01.242 --> 00:03.078
'In the criminal justice system,

00:03.120 --> 00:06.915
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.957 --> 00:11.086
'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:11.128 --> 00:14.757
'are members of an elite squad,
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.798 --> 00:16.842
'These are their stories.'

00:18.177 --> 00:20.679
Seven robberies, all electronics stores,

00:20.721 --> 00:24.433
by a pot-bellied man with a handgun
just before closing.

00:24.475 --> 00:26.560
Yes, sir. That is correct.

00:26.602 --> 00:30.981
When did your robbery unit
determine these were part of a pattern?

00:31.023 --> 00:32.941
After the third one.

00:32.983 --> 00:36.486
You didn't write it up
until the seventh had occurred.

00:36.528 --> 00:38.488
- No, sir.
- And as a result,

00:38.530 --> 00:42.743
when a similar robbery occurred
in Queens, they couldn't connect it.

00:42.784 --> 00:45.078
We made a mistake.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.749
You did. It seems robbery
is not your strong suit.

00:48.790 --> 00:53.378
Accordingly, I ask that you report
to the Personnel Office for reassignment.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.047
That is all.

00:58.550 --> 01:02.721
OK. Let's hear from Special Victims.
Captain Cragen.

01:08.351 --> 01:11.062
Erm, good morning, Commissioner Morris.

01:11.104 --> 01:15.191
Captain. I hear we have a man who
masturbates on the Third Avenue bus.

01:15.233 --> 01:20.196
We used to. Detectives Benson
and Stabler made an arrest yesterday.

01:20.238 --> 01:24.200
- You sure he's the guy?
- Yes, sir. His name is Olaf Vargas.

01:24.242 --> 01:27.787
- He has a long list of priors.
- Good. I hope they clean the seats.

01:27.829 --> 01:29.831
Slide.

01:32.542 --> 01:35.962
Do you recognise these addresses,
Captain Cragen?

01:37.922 --> 01:41.134
- No, sir. I do not.
- Let me refresh your memory.

01:41.176 --> 01:44.012
Three break-in rapes in less than a week.

01:44.053 --> 01:47.932
Last week, DNA backlog matched them
to one unknown assailant.

01:47.974 --> 01:51.102
- Do you remember now?
- No, sir.

01:51.144 --> 01:54.439
If you'd read your circular,
you'd recognise this

01:54.480 --> 01:58.401
as newly-identified rape pattern
for 1995.

01:58.443 --> 02:02.030
1995? Sir, I was in Homicide in 1995.

02:02.071 --> 02:06.868
But it's still yours. Have you done anything
on these cases lately?

02:06.909 --> 02:09.454
No, sir. They were considered cold.

02:09.495 --> 02:12.957
You realise, if no progress is made soon
on these cases

02:12.999 --> 02:15.751
we'll be time-barred from prosecuting.

02:15.793 --> 02:20.882
Sir, I am aware of the five-year
statute of limitations on rape but...

02:20.923 --> 02:26.345
Have you talked to any of the victims
since you took command of the SVU?

02:26.387 --> 02:29.015
- No, sir.
- Now's your opportunity.

02:29.056 --> 02:34.353
One of them has volunteered
to address us today. Ms Kraft?

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:50.202 --> 02:53.205
My name is Victoria Kraft.

02:53.247 --> 02:56.041
On February 8th, 1995,

02:56.083 --> 02:59.670
while I slept,
a man broke into my apartment,

02:59.712 --> 03:02.590
stripped and climbed into my bed.

03:02.631 --> 03:05.342
He forcibly had sexual intercourse
with me.

03:05.384 --> 03:07.761
He Maced me, then left.

03:08.679 --> 03:12.850
I immediately notified the police
but no arrest was ever made.

03:14.601 --> 03:19.231
Commissioner Morris recently told me
the same man raped two other women.

03:19.940 --> 03:22.568
No arrest was made
in either of their cases.

03:22.609 --> 03:28.490
I don't understand why, but rape carries
a five-year statute of limitations.

03:29.575 --> 03:32.661
It's harder to dodge a parking ticket.

03:32.703 --> 03:37.833
If he's not arrested soon, the man
who attacked me will go unpunished.

03:38.709 --> 03:43.839
I urge the NYPD,
and especially the Special Victims Unit,

03:44.548 --> 03:46.633
to revisit my case

03:46.675 --> 03:49.469
before the statute expires.

03:49.511 --> 03:53.181
Thank you, Commissioner,
for the opportunity to speak.

03:54.975 --> 03:57.060
Captain Cragen?

04:00.188 --> 04:01.857
Thank you, Ms Kraft.

04:01.898 --> 04:05.861
I promise you, we will assign
your case the highest priority.

04:56.703 --> 04:58.955
Hey, how was ComStat?

04:58.997 --> 05:01.082
- That bad?
- That bad.

05:01.124 --> 05:05.044
It's like having the IRS audit
your case files every three weeks.

05:05.086 --> 05:08.548
Yeah, ComStat is the worst system
except for all the others.

05:08.589 --> 05:12.552
It's a pain in the ass for guys like me
but it does weed out slackers.

05:12.593 --> 05:15.847
Hey, I'm working
on the Third Avenue jerker.

05:15.888 --> 05:18.975
I got something else for you
and Jeffries.

05:19.016 --> 05:21.894
Jennifer Neal.
She was raped in her apartment.

05:21.936 --> 05:26.315
Benson, Stabler. Take the other two
victims. Same doer. Same MO.

05:26.357 --> 05:28.609
This stuff is from 1995.

05:28.651 --> 05:34.073
The ME is working through the DNA backlog
on 12,000 kits from unsolved rapes,

05:34.115 --> 05:37.702
matching them against every offender,
in the system or not.

05:37.743 --> 05:39.829
So we have three open rapes

05:39.870 --> 05:43.582
never before connected to each other,
all done by one guy in a week.

05:43.624 --> 05:45.918
- Do we have a name?
- No.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.421
But we do have this genetic profile

05:48.462 --> 05:52.842
so for now we'll use
the lab's designation, John Doe 121.

05:52.883 --> 05:56.804
He breaks into women's apartments,
climbs into bed with them,

05:56.846 --> 05:59.515
they wake up, his face is covered,
he rapes them.

05:59.557 --> 06:02.893
Then he Maces them,
dresses and walks out the door.

06:02.935 --> 06:07.189
- So, he did three and then stopped?
- Maybe he started using a condom.

06:07.231 --> 06:10.901
- A very thoughtful rapist.
- White male, in his 20s,

06:10.943 --> 06:14.446
maybe in his 30s now,
between 5'10'and 6'1'.

06:14.488 --> 06:18.575
His weight is 160. Obviously that
might have changed by now.

06:18.617 --> 06:22.204
- Long brown or black hair.
- He could be a tub of lard

06:22.246 --> 06:27.501
- with a greying buzz cut.
- The statute of limitation expires...

06:27.543 --> 06:31.463
That's the point.
While you reinterview the victims

06:31.505 --> 06:35.175
I'll ask the DA for an arrest warrant.

06:35.217 --> 06:38.262
An arrest warrant on a nobody?

06:38.303 --> 06:42.641
No, we'll try to get the warrant
on his DNA. Might stop the clock.

06:42.683 --> 06:45.894
- They're trying that in Wisconsin.
- These are the days

06:45.936 --> 06:50.774
until the statute of limitations
expires on each case.

06:50.816 --> 06:54.945
So, if we fail, and the courts deny us,

06:54.987 --> 07:00.701
then in four days, John Doe 121
is gonna get away with three rapes.

07:05.247 --> 07:09.501
I know it's five years but there
may be something that came to you,

07:09.543 --> 07:12.421
something you realised about the attacker.

07:12.462 --> 07:14.965
He was wearing a stocking mask.

07:15.006 --> 07:18.093
Yes. Yes, that's in the detective's notes.

07:18.135 --> 07:21.638
Maybe something you saw later
that reminded you of him?

07:21.680 --> 07:26.101
- No, I don't think so.
- Two other women were raped by him.

07:26.142 --> 07:28.353
Both say he left through the front door.

07:28.395 --> 07:33.692
- Your file doesn't say how he left.
- Oh. That's a good question.

07:33.733 --> 07:37.904
This is a floor plan of the apartment
where you were living in '95.

07:37.946 --> 07:39.989
Take a look.

07:40.615 --> 07:43.535
Oh, yeah. I forgot.
See, in my old apartment,

07:43.576 --> 07:47.497
to get to the bedroom
you had to go through the bathroom.

07:48.331 --> 07:50.708
How did he leave?

07:50.750 --> 07:55.004
I guess he went out the front door.
I don't remember. I'm sorry.

07:55.046 --> 07:59.801
Lois, we're on your case full time now
so I'm gonna give you my card.

07:59.843 --> 08:04.180
If anything comes to you,
anything at all, please call.

08:05.890 --> 08:09.811
- I wasn't much help, was I?
- No, no. Lois, you did great.

08:09.852 --> 08:12.480
Great. We appreciate you taking the time.

08:14.816 --> 08:17.735
- The man's a three-time rapist.
- What can I do?

08:17.777 --> 08:19.987
Persuade a judge to issue a warrant.

08:20.029 --> 08:22.949
- We have no name.
- We have a genetic profile.

08:22.990 --> 08:25.993
The Wisconsin manoeuvre?
There's no case law here.

08:26.035 --> 08:30.456
Somebody's gotta be first. He raped
them and Maced them on the way out.

08:30.498 --> 08:34.376
When the precedents were created
no one anticipated these advances.

08:34.418 --> 08:36.087
It's a lot of legal work.

08:36.128 --> 08:39.006
Look at it this way.
Every time you get into a cab,

08:39.048 --> 08:41.509
John Doe 121 might be the driver.

08:50.267 --> 08:53.604
The rape was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

08:53.646 --> 08:56.941
That's what you always hear
but it's not the whole story.

08:56.982 --> 08:58.401
What do you mean?

08:58.442 --> 09:01.320
What happened afterwards changed my life.

09:01.946 --> 09:05.616
I received so much love and support
from so many people.

09:05.658 --> 09:08.410
It reaffirmed my faith in humanity.

09:08.452 --> 09:10.704
You seem to have adjusted very well.

09:10.746 --> 09:14.208
I went to a very dark place. I wanted to die.

09:14.250 --> 09:18.212
But the people in my life saw that
happening and took care of me.

09:18.254 --> 09:22.591
Once I thought I was alone.
Now I know I'm part of a community.

09:22.633 --> 09:24.885
- We're reopening your case.
- Oh?

09:24.927 --> 09:29.139
We just learned from DNA two other
women were attacked by the same man.

09:29.181 --> 09:33.185
- Oh, no. When did it happen?
- Within a week of your attack.

09:33.227 --> 09:36.772
We thought comparing
the three stories might help.

09:36.814 --> 09:41.610
One victim reported that the attacker
knew details of her life. You did, too.

09:41.652 --> 09:46.198
He knew my dog's name
and the restaurant where I ate breakfast.

09:46.240 --> 09:51.787
Is there anything you've remembered since,
some detail you may have failed to report?

09:52.621 --> 09:57.376
Nothing I didn't tell the detectives.
It's not a time I like to revisit.

09:57.417 --> 10:02.089
I understand. Sorry to bring this up.
We only have a small window of time.

10:02.130 --> 10:03.966
Why?

10:04.007 --> 10:07.427
In rape cases charges
have to be brought within five years.

10:08.053 --> 10:11.348
I just want this to end.

10:11.390 --> 10:13.892
Your Honour, we need an arrest warrant.

10:13.934 --> 10:16.603
- I need to eat lunch.
- This is urgent.

10:16.645 --> 10:19.106
- Where's his name?
- It's a John Doe warrant.

10:19.147 --> 10:22.901
I issued one yesterday. Four guys
robbed a bank. We caught three.

10:22.943 --> 10:26.613
I based a warrant on a gang name
and a description. Who's this?

10:26.655 --> 10:29.950
He raped three women.
Identifying information is here.

10:29.991 --> 10:33.495
- It looks like a lab report.
- It is. It's his DNA.

10:33.536 --> 10:35.747
The ME's labelled him John Doe 121.

10:35.789 --> 10:37.832
- Like the case in...
- Wisconsin.

10:37.874 --> 10:42.504
Which hasn't got our defence bar.
Why not let this case run its course?

10:42.545 --> 10:45.590
It won't be litigated until he's apprehended.

10:45.632 --> 10:47.926
Statute of limitations ends tonight.

10:47.967 --> 10:52.472
If you've had five years,
I want till the end of the day to decide.

10:58.186 --> 11:01.314
To tell the truth,
I was disappointed at the detectives

11:01.356 --> 11:03.024
who were assigned to my case.

11:03.066 --> 11:05.818
- Why disappointed?
- I never got the impression

11:05.860 --> 11:08.112
they were the best or the brightest.

11:08.154 --> 11:10.823
They were overloaded with other cases.

11:10.865 --> 11:13.326
And the man who raped me
is still out there.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.954
I'm sure they were trying their best.

11:15.995 --> 11:19.415
I disagree, so I hired a private investigator.

11:19.457 --> 11:23.127
He answers only to me.
These are copies of his reports.

11:23.169 --> 11:27.340
First, he found the security in
my building deficient. That's separate.

11:27.382 --> 11:30.802
I have a suit against them.
But there was the guy on the bike.

11:30.843 --> 11:33.471
- What guy?
- A neighbour in my building

11:33.513 --> 11:36.390
saw a kid speed away
right after it happened.

11:36.432 --> 11:40.311
- We'd like to talk to him.
- You should.

11:45.233 --> 11:48.819
I was standing out here smoking a butt,
maybe midnight, 1am.

11:48.861 --> 11:52.448
From the alley,
this kid speeds out on a green bike.

11:52.490 --> 11:55.451
He sees me, swerves.
Wham! He falls to the ground.

11:55.493 --> 11:59.622
I think, 'Maybe he's hurt.'
Go to see, he's got a cut on his elbow.

11:59.664 --> 12:02.124
But he just gets back up and speeds away.

12:02.166 --> 12:05.711
- What kind of bike?
- An R500. Touring bike.

12:05.753 --> 12:09.882
Fenders, drop handlebars,
reflective lime-green paint.

12:09.924 --> 12:12.760
- You really know your bikes.
- I ought to.

12:12.802 --> 12:15.054
I worked in a bike shop over 28 years.

12:15.095 --> 12:18.974
- You get a look at the rider?
- He was wearing a motorcycle helmet,

12:19.058 --> 12:21.060
on a bike!

12:21.101 --> 12:25.689
- And er... a jump suit.
- Maybe a uniform?

12:25.731 --> 12:28.609
I don't know. It's been five years.

12:32.571 --> 12:35.282
Counsellor Eastman, Captain Cragen.

12:35.324 --> 12:39.244
I find your application
for an arrest warrant ingenious.

12:39.286 --> 12:42.998
The statute of limitations
has a long history in common law.

12:43.082 --> 12:46.335
It exists to ensure the defendant
receives a fair trial,

12:46.376 --> 12:50.172
that the recollections of witnesses,
if any, are fresh,

12:50.214 --> 12:54.092
to pressure the government
to file charges in a timely manner

12:54.134 --> 12:56.470
and so that, rightly or wrongly,

12:56.512 --> 12:59.473
accused citizens need not live
their life in fear

12:59.514 --> 13:03.352
of the government pursuing them
after a long delay.

13:03.393 --> 13:05.646
But when these laws were codified,

13:05.687 --> 13:09.691
we did not have
the technological marvels that exist today.

13:09.733 --> 13:13.028
Your application is a novel idea.

13:13.070 --> 13:17.491
However, it is not the role of this court
to evaluate novel ideas,

13:17.532 --> 13:21.578
and as such, I cannot grant your application.

13:21.620 --> 13:26.500
Your Honour, Ms Kraft will not see
justice unless a warrant is issued.

13:26.541 --> 13:29.044
- Will you appeal?
- Yes, Your Honour.

13:29.085 --> 13:32.756
Good, because I've passed
the paperwork on to an appellate judge

13:32.797 --> 13:35.675
- in anticipation of such an appeal.
- You have?

13:35.759 --> 13:38.678
Yes. If my decision is reversed.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.514
I hope it's soon enough to do you
some good.

13:41.556 --> 13:43.975
This hearing is adjourned.

13:46.353 --> 13:49.314
Ms Kraft. You didn't hear
the rest of his decision.

13:49.356 --> 13:51.399
- It'll be appealed.
- It'll be OK.

13:51.441 --> 13:54.110
It's not OK.

13:54.152 --> 13:59.532
You fell down on the job and used
legal trickery to hide the mistakes.

13:59.574 --> 14:03.119
- That's not true.
- You waited five years

14:03.161 --> 14:06.164
for this half-cocked legal manoeuvre.

14:06.206 --> 14:08.291
Is that supposed to mollify me?

14:08.333 --> 14:11.836
Am I the only one
to know the law's an ass?

14:11.878 --> 14:14.339
I endured the rape exam.

14:14.380 --> 14:17.050
I let you know intimate details of my life.

14:17.091 --> 14:19.344
It was embarrassing but I did it.

14:19.385 --> 14:22.472
The promise was
you would do something for me.

14:23.306 --> 14:25.224
And today,

14:25.266 --> 14:28.686
yet another person
in a long line of incompetents

14:28.728 --> 14:32.899
tells me, 'Sorry you got raped.
We're not gonna do jack about it.'

14:32.940 --> 14:37.487
Thank you for making this
the second-worst day of my entire life!

14:38.946 --> 14:41.073
I think you know what the first was.

14:53.169 --> 14:57.298
Vicky Kraft was raped by John Doe 121

14:57.340 --> 14:59.592
five years ago today.

14:59.634 --> 15:03.763
She will never see him stand trial
for that rape.

15:03.804 --> 15:05.639
What do we do with the case now?

15:05.681 --> 15:09.727
Stick with it. Maybe we can make him
on one of the other cases.

15:09.769 --> 15:13.272
She can still testify at the other victim's trial.

15:13.314 --> 15:16.901
Another right-wing end-run
around the constitution.

15:16.942 --> 15:20.237
- Whose side are you on?
- Hey, I want this creep, too.

15:20.279 --> 15:24.033
But sometimes in cracking down on crime
we forget civil liberties.

15:24.074 --> 15:28.495
What are you saying?
If John Doe 121 marched in now

15:28.537 --> 15:32.333
and confessed to Vicky Kraft's rape,
would you let him go?

15:32.374 --> 15:35.711
- No. The law that protects us...
- Against what?

15:35.753 --> 15:39.173
There was a time I was a thorn
in the government's side

15:39.214 --> 15:43.344
so I'm glad they can't capriciously
arrest us for old crimes.

15:43.385 --> 15:46.680
We're not capriciously arresting anyone.
We have DNA.

15:46.722 --> 15:51.185
We won't arrest anyone unless we make
a case on one of the other rapes.

15:51.226 --> 15:54.396
We'll talk to the detectives
who first investigated.

15:54.438 --> 15:56.899
- OK with you?
- Sure. It'll be like visiting

15:56.940 --> 15:59.943
the Special Victims Unit
Alumni Association.

15:59.985 --> 16:03.739
All the people that used to sit at
these desks. Where are they now?

16:07.784 --> 16:12.748
I remember Vicky Kraft's rape.
A frustrating, no-leads case.

16:12.789 --> 16:15.459
It was one of the reasons I transferred.

16:15.500 --> 16:19.421
- Frustration?
- No. She sued me and my partner.

16:19.463 --> 16:23.383
- Sued you on what grounds?
- She got some high-priced attorney

16:23.425 --> 16:27.596
to say we were derelict in our duties.
The PBA lawyers handled it.

16:27.637 --> 16:32.642
- The suit was thrown out, but, boy!
- No good deed goes unpunished.

16:32.684 --> 16:35.937
She was just angry
we weren't making any headway,

16:35.979 --> 16:39.983
- but we were on her case 24/7.
- Did you have any suspects?

16:40.025 --> 16:44.863
None. But I had a clear mental picture
of the kind of guy he was.

16:44.905 --> 16:47.073
What was your thinking?

16:47.115 --> 16:49.618
He gets past two locked doors.

16:49.659 --> 16:54.414
This is one of those buildings
where you have to get buzzed in twice.

16:54.456 --> 16:59.252
No tenants remember letting anyone in
even though someone had to.

16:59.294 --> 17:02.422
- The kind of guy nobody notices.
- Right. White guy,

17:02.464 --> 17:05.133
under-employed, filled with resentment.

17:05.175 --> 17:07.635
A nobody. A paper boy or meter reader.

17:07.676 --> 17:10.555
- Now he's a triple nobody.
- What do you mean?

17:10.597 --> 17:13.473
DNA matched him to two other open rapes.

17:15.351 --> 17:17.436
I... I hate to hear that.

17:18.688 --> 17:23.067
- You worked a case. Jennifer Neal.
- Oh, yeah. Real nice lady.

17:23.108 --> 17:27.696
We've reopened her case.
Anything you remember, we'd appreciate.

17:27.739 --> 17:30.616
- This guy knew about her.
- An acquaintance?

17:30.658 --> 17:34.245
- She didn't know him.
- What kind of things did he know?

17:34.287 --> 17:38.458
What car she drove,
where she worked, where she shopped.

17:38.499 --> 17:41.461
- How did he know that?
- We never found out.

17:41.502 --> 17:44.714
We thought maybe he tapped
her phones or read her mail.

17:44.755 --> 17:48.009
It never makes sense
till you interrogate the guy, you know?

17:48.050 --> 17:50.678
- Too well.
- We tied her rape to two others.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.931
Oh, damn. Who caught the other rapes?

17:53.973 --> 17:56.100
Ruby Mazzanti had Kraft's.

17:56.142 --> 18:00.187
Ruby? Great gal. We never made
the connection. Who got the other?

18:00.229 --> 18:03.107
- Detective Dan Latimer.
- Oh, hell.

18:03.149 --> 18:06.152
- Why? What about him?
- You know the type.

18:06.193 --> 18:09.363
You think he should leave
but you can't bad-mouth him.

18:09.405 --> 18:13.159
- What did he do?
- He said most rapes were fantasies.

18:13.200 --> 18:17.997
He screwed up a case. They told him
to retire or be fired. He retired.

18:18.038 --> 18:21.167
- Where is he now?
- He runs the Ten Thirteen.

18:21.208 --> 18:24.628
A cop bar in Queens.
Old-timers go there. Go talk to him.

18:24.670 --> 18:29.091
So, Roy, what made you get out
of Special Victims?

18:31.385 --> 18:34.638
On my last case,
the victim was raped and murdered.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.141
All in a day's work, right?

18:37.182 --> 18:40.477
But there's plier marks
all over her body like she was...

18:40.519 --> 18:42.813
tortured for a week before she died.

18:43.439 --> 18:45.524
Her name was Jo-Jo.

18:48.110 --> 18:51.030
Nobody sees what we see.

18:58.203 --> 19:01.331
Sex crimes cops
are garbage collectors.

19:01.373 --> 19:03.458
Do two years and get out, I say.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.587
- We wanna discuss one of your cases.
- I retired.

19:06.628 --> 19:09.464
- The rapist didn't.
- Department did me no favours.

19:09.506 --> 19:13.969
Six months shy of my 20, they squeeze
me out to screw me on the pension.

19:14.011 --> 19:16.763
- Bastards.
- Yeah. Watch your back.

19:16.805 --> 19:19.182
A snake pit of politics, that is,

19:19.224 --> 19:25.397
but we're stuck with it so we hoped
you could help us out, cop to cop.

19:25.439 --> 19:28.567
Yeah. The little Trekkie.

19:28.608 --> 19:31.236
- You hardly made any notes.
- You'll learn.

19:31.278 --> 19:34.865
- Learn what?
- Self-preservation. Pick your shots.

19:34.906 --> 19:39.077
If you go all out on every
so-called rape you'll wear yourself out.

19:39.119 --> 19:41.621
What do you think of the case?

19:42.914 --> 19:45.667
- There's the whole story. ONS.
- ONS?

19:45.709 --> 19:48.587
One-night stand. She's a bookworm type.

19:48.628 --> 19:51.548
If she got a guy
she wouldn't know what to do.

19:51.590 --> 19:54.926
- What's that got to do with it?
- She gets laid, feels bad,

19:54.968 --> 19:59.347
makes up this mysterious stranger
who knows intimate details about her...

19:59.389 --> 20:02.350
- Gimme a break!
- So you're saying nothing happened?

20:02.392 --> 20:06.396
Well, she did get lucky, probably
with some pimply little bookworm.

20:06.438 --> 20:11.109
- But the rape? That's a stretch.
- You're pretty sure of yourself.

20:11.943 --> 20:14.487
Morning after regrets.

20:14.529 --> 20:16.614
- Well, you know what, Dan?
- What?

20:16.656 --> 20:20.743
DNA matched her attacker's semen
with two other rape victims.

20:21.452 --> 20:24.831
We're filing an arrest warrant
on the genetic ID.

20:24.873 --> 20:28.668
So I made a mistake.
Let me buy you a drink.

20:35.758 --> 20:40.722
You've made a solemn case for the certainty
with which DNA identifies an individual.

20:40.763 --> 20:43.599
One in seven billion, Your Honour.

20:43.641 --> 20:49.272
It's as specific as having John Doe
121's name, address and number.

20:49.313 --> 20:52.817
- Yes, Your Honour.
- Why not file warrants on all rapes?

20:53.901 --> 20:58.281
- I'm not following you, Your Honour.
- It's the future, right?

20:58.322 --> 21:03.411
Get a smear of genetic information,
file a John Doe and catch the perpetrator.

21:03.452 --> 21:09.458
The People are only applying because
of the case's unique circumstances.

21:09.500 --> 21:13.963
But if the court says yes this time,
why stop at rapists?

21:14.005 --> 21:17.842
We could make out arrest warrants
for every mugger, turnstile jumper

21:17.883 --> 21:21.554
and sidewalk spitter,
using little swatches of genetic code.

21:21.595 --> 21:24.473
Your Honour, he raped three women

21:24.515 --> 21:28.519
and the statute of limitations
on his crimes expires in two days!

21:28.561 --> 21:31.730
The court understands
what a danger he may be,

21:31.772 --> 21:36.068
but that does not mean that we can
circumvent the law to apprehend him.

21:36.944 --> 21:40.573
The application to file
an arrest warrant is denied.

21:40.614 --> 21:43.075
Lois?

21:44.493 --> 21:47.538
- Are you all right?
- 'Fear is the little death.

21:47.579 --> 21:52.668
'It brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.'

21:52.710 --> 21:55.087
Sit down. It's all right.

22:02.511 --> 22:06.140
I was 24. The biggest thing
that had ever happened to me

22:06.181 --> 22:09.560
was when Brandon Lee died
making the movie The Crow.

22:09.601 --> 22:13.397
My girlfriend and I
went to see it again and again

22:13.438 --> 22:17.568
because it was beautiful and tragic
and we loved it

22:17.609 --> 22:19.903
and I was really just still a girl.

22:19.945 --> 22:22.489
I want you to tell me what he did.

22:23.532 --> 22:27.119
OK, erm, the sex wasn't the worst thing.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.246
I'm not queasy about that.

22:29.287 --> 22:32.791
I had even thought about
what I would do if I were raped.

22:32.833 --> 22:38.630
It was just something that happened.
But er... it was what he said.

22:38.672 --> 22:41.800
What did he say?

22:41.842 --> 22:44.719
He knew I liked Brandon

22:44.761 --> 22:48.056
and he wanted to talk about The Crow.

22:48.098 --> 22:52.102
- He was eavesdropping.
- Why did he have to do that?

22:52.143 --> 22:55.897
I gave him the sex.
I wanted him to just leave.

22:55.939 --> 23:00.277
But he wanted to talk
about all the things that were mine.

23:00.318 --> 23:04.656
And I was scared.
And we talked about Brandon

23:04.698 --> 23:07.575
and, erm, and then he says,

23:07.617 --> 23:12.205
'You're a sweetheart, Lolly,' and he leaves.

23:12.247 --> 23:16.668
The only person that calls me Lolly
is my grandmother.

23:16.709 --> 23:20.880
- How does he know that?
- We're trying to find out.

23:20.922 --> 23:24.759
The other two survivors
reported a similar experience.

23:24.801 --> 23:29.347
The detective who came before
said I should talk to a counsellor.

23:29.389 --> 23:32.141
- A rape crisis counsellor?
- No, a shrink!

23:32.183 --> 23:34.435
Like it didn't happen, like I was crazy.

23:34.477 --> 23:38.022
You're not crazy.
You can help us find the man that did this.

23:38.064 --> 23:42.026
You think someone tapped
your telephone, read your mail?

23:42.068 --> 23:44.654
- One of the other women thought so.
- No.

23:44.696 --> 23:50.701
He knew things I never said on
the phone, like where I Rollerbladed.

23:50.743 --> 23:53.663
Do you think he could have been
on a bicycle?

23:53.704 --> 23:57.500
Yes. Yes. A green bicycle, yes.

23:57.542 --> 24:00.128
I told the other detective about that.

24:00.169 --> 24:04.966
He said for a while I'd see every man
on the street as the rapist.

24:05.007 --> 24:07.843
No, Lois. I can assure you... he was real.

24:09.053 --> 24:11.514
I knew it was him,

24:11.555 --> 24:15.017
because he was always around
and I kept seeing him before,

24:15.059 --> 24:17.728
months before he came into my room, but...

24:17.770 --> 24:20.314
I knew... it was him.

24:21.399 --> 24:23.734
The man on the green bike.

24:27.780 --> 24:30.658
- Vicky Kraft? Drawing a blank.
- She was raped.

24:30.699 --> 24:33.160
You talked to a witness
who saw a green bike.

24:33.202 --> 24:35.788
- And?
- You billed her for 87 hours

24:35.830 --> 24:37.915
at $100 an hour.

24:38.624 --> 24:44.213
A retiree saw a green bicycle.
I thought it was a messenger service.

24:44.255 --> 24:48.509
There was this one,
Green Machine Bike Messengers.

24:48.550 --> 24:51.512
Did you interview them?
It's not in your report.

24:51.553 --> 24:56.266
- No. They'd gone out of business.
- The employees didn't disappear.

24:56.308 --> 25:01.689
You're cops. You've got resources
I can only dream about. I tried.

25:01.730 --> 25:05.317
You think John Doe 121
is a bicycle messenger?

25:05.359 --> 25:10.155
And stalker. He followed these women
for weeks before he attacked them.

25:10.197 --> 25:14.117
- Is he invisible?
- He follows them on his bike.

25:14.159 --> 25:17.663
He watches Creen with her grandma,
learns her secret name.

25:17.704 --> 25:21.583
He sees Neal call her dog. He knows
where they go cos he follows them.

25:21.625 --> 25:24.044
Textbook reassurance rapist behaviour.

25:24.086 --> 25:27.297
As a prelude to the rape,
you learn their schedules.

25:27.339 --> 25:29.841
When he knows they're home alone,

25:29.883 --> 25:33.470
he breaks into their secure buildings
by conning them,

25:33.512 --> 25:38.558
saying, 'I have a package for you', goes in,
rapes them, walks out, rides away.

25:38.600 --> 25:43.355
I order books on the net.
I couldn't describe one of my delivery guys.

25:43.397 --> 25:46.983
- Perfect disguise.
- I found his old boss.

25:47.025 --> 25:51.655
The owner of the bankrupted
Green Machine runs a laundromat.

25:55.617 --> 25:58.620
All my guys wore the jump suit
and rode green R500s.

25:58.662 --> 26:02.457
- How many employees did you have?
- I dunno.

26:02.499 --> 26:06.753
40 on any given day. Probably 100
during the business's whole run.

26:06.795 --> 26:10.882
If we gave you addresses
could you say if you delivered there?

26:10.924 --> 26:13.009
It would take a couple of weeks.

26:13.051 --> 26:16.679
Have you a computer? We only
wanna check five or six addresses.

26:18.973 --> 26:21.226
Whoa...

26:22.143 --> 26:25.271
- These are your records?
- I was a better cyclist

26:25.313 --> 26:28.233
- than businessman.
- What happened to your company?

26:28.274 --> 26:31.194
I forgot to pay all the taxes. Got busted.

26:31.236 --> 26:34.113
One guy got hurt.
I didn't have the right insurance.

26:34.155 --> 26:38.201
We were good at what we did,
but not too good with the paperwork.

26:38.243 --> 26:41.329
- Right. Can we take these?
- Keep them.

26:41.371 --> 26:47.168
If I get audited again I'll say cops
took the records. Perfect excuse.

26:47.210 --> 26:51.255
On the receipts
the middle line shows the address.

26:51.297 --> 26:55.426
There isn't time.
The statute runs out in two days.

26:55.468 --> 26:58.679
We just need to know if a messenger
was sent to an address.

26:58.721 --> 27:02.183
You know what?
Let's just look at the billing records.

27:04.727 --> 27:07.772
What was the name
of the company where Neal worked?

27:07.814 --> 27:10.358
Magnitude Insurance Services.

27:10.399 --> 27:13.986
That's what I thought.
Four deliveries the week before her rape.

27:14.028 --> 27:15.488
We got a messenger's name?

27:15.529 --> 27:20.159
No, but we never asked Neal about
a messenger. It may jog her memory.

27:20.201 --> 27:25.373
Your work took deliveries from
Green Machine Bicycle Messengers.

27:25.414 --> 27:29.293
- I remember them.
- Anything about the messengers?

27:29.335 --> 27:31.420
I'd rather not say.

27:32.505 --> 27:36.217
We believe he may be the man
who attacked you.

27:36.258 --> 27:40.638
I didn't misunderstand you.
I just don't want to answer your question.

27:40.679 --> 27:42.765
Why?

27:44.850 --> 27:47.728
In five years a lot of things can change.

27:47.770 --> 27:50.856
- Yes, they can.
- What if...

27:50.898 --> 27:55.152
I think it's wrong to pursue this.
Maybe it's time to let it drop.

27:55.194 --> 27:59.114
If you're worried about testifying,
it probably isn't necessary.

27:59.156 --> 28:01.992
We can make a case on the DNA alone.

28:02.034 --> 28:04.119
That's not it.

28:04.161 --> 28:07.664
This five-year rule...
Maybe that's a good thing.

28:07.706 --> 28:12.836
You try your best but then you say,
'Time to let it go and move on.'

28:12.878 --> 28:15.964
The five years aren't even over.
We can still get him.

28:16.006 --> 28:18.509
No. I don't think you should.

28:18.550 --> 28:21.470
This man raped two other women.

28:21.512 --> 28:25.849
- He's still a danger to others.
- What if he isn't?

28:28.560 --> 28:30.938
You know who he is.

28:33.982 --> 28:36.068
Do you?

28:39.988 --> 28:42.866
We met... by accident.

28:43.742 --> 28:47.245
He didn't recognise me
but I recognised him. I talked to him.

28:47.287 --> 28:51.333
- What did you talk about?
- His life.

28:51.374 --> 28:53.960
It wasn't a pretty picture, either.

28:54.002 --> 28:57.756
When I was satisfied that he had changed,
I told him who I was.

28:57.798 --> 29:02.177
- Why didn't you call the police?
- He wanted to. I stopped him.

29:02.219 --> 29:04.429
Why?

29:06.139 --> 29:09.059
He's a changed man.

29:10.101 --> 29:12.687
We prayed together.

29:14.981 --> 29:17.901
You prayed with your rapist.

29:18.943 --> 29:23.365
Yeah. To turn him in after that
would be a betrayal.

29:26.284 --> 29:31.122
I don't know what he told you,
but these guys do not change.

29:31.164 --> 29:35.084
- He is still a danger.
- I disagree.

29:36.461 --> 29:39.339
What religion are you?

29:39.380 --> 29:42.967
I'm a member of the Society of Friends.

29:43.009 --> 29:45.345
- And what's that?
- The Quakers.

29:45.386 --> 29:48.181
We have a long history of pacifism.

29:48.222 --> 29:53.436
We believe that if you sit silently,
God will speak to you in your heart.

29:53.478 --> 29:57.106
- And you think your attacker was...
- I believe he reformed.

29:57.148 --> 29:59.942
- That's for a jury to decide.
- No!

29:59.984 --> 30:02.904
'Love your enemy' is in the Bible.

30:02.945 --> 30:07.074
It's easy to pay lip service to that ideal
but very hard to live it.

30:07.116 --> 30:12.121
I know the Quakers created
the penal system in this country. Correct?

30:12.163 --> 30:15.791
Yes, but it's been perverted
beyond recognition.

30:15.833 --> 30:19.045
- Prisons are filled with violence.
- Maybe they are.

30:19.086 --> 30:22.214
But this is not the arena to fight that fight.

30:22.256 --> 30:25.134
If you want prison reform, join Prison Watch.

30:25.176 --> 30:30.097
You change nothing by protecting
a rapist from being prosecuted.

30:30.139 --> 30:35.519
- I came to peace with what happened.
- But what about his other victims?

30:35.561 --> 30:38.314
What about the women in this community?

30:38.355 --> 30:41.067
Don't you feel responsibility towards them?

30:41.150 --> 30:43.652
I have thought this through.

30:43.694 --> 30:47.406
I'm not turning him in to satisfy
some abstract concept of justice...

30:47.448 --> 30:50.075
This is not abstract, Jennifer.

30:50.951 --> 30:55.206
These women were sexually assaulted
and Maced.

30:55.247 --> 30:59.209
And they want their attacker
brought to justice. They wanna know.

31:02.546 --> 31:05.674
You have to at least listen to them.

31:07.134 --> 31:09.887
'Jennifer... Can I call you that?'

31:09.928 --> 31:13.849
- 'Sure. Please.'
- 'It's not just you he attacked.'

31:13.891 --> 31:18.604
'He broke into my apartment,
and Lois's and probably more.'

31:18.645 --> 31:22.107
- 'I know what you've been through.'
- Tell us his name.

31:22.149 --> 31:24.818
I made a personal spiritual decision.

31:24.860 --> 31:28.197
- To keep him all to yourself.
- No. That's not it.

31:28.238 --> 31:33.118
It's better than having him in jail.
He knows you can drop him in it.

31:33.160 --> 31:36.747
It's revenge. You have the power
of life and death over him.

31:36.788 --> 31:40.125
- I don't want that kind of power.
- But it's true, isn't it?

31:40.167 --> 31:43.503
So just drop the Lamb-of-God rap
and tell us his name.

31:43.545 --> 31:47.549
- Lois and I deserve a shot at him.
- I just wanna know who he is.

31:47.591 --> 31:50.260
Finding out his name won't give you peace.

31:50.302 --> 31:52.971
I found out. It changed nothing.

31:53.013 --> 31:57.434
Do the people you work with
know you're harbouring a fugitive?

31:57.476 --> 32:01.229
- Those who need to know support me.
- Eastern Health Services?

32:01.271 --> 32:03.607
That's where I work.

32:03.648 --> 32:07.903
One of my companies has 600 employees
insured by Eastern.

32:07.944 --> 32:11.197
- What are you saying?
- I can't keep my business

32:11.239 --> 32:14.034
at a place that employs
a betrayer of women.

32:14.075 --> 32:16.870
Ms Kraft, sit down, please.

32:23.376 --> 32:28.757
Who is he? Don't you know what it's like,
thinking any man could be him?

32:28.798 --> 32:31.801
I want him to pay for what he did to me!

32:31.843 --> 32:36.389
Where is he?
Tell me his name, you stupid bitch!

32:36.431 --> 32:39.350
Ms Neal, let's go.

32:42.353 --> 32:44.606
Lois, I hope you find peace.

32:44.647 --> 32:47.192
Shut up, you freak!

32:47.233 --> 32:49.736
Shut up!

32:57.285 --> 33:00.872
- Neal's not gonna talk.
- We've got 15 hours.

33:00.913 --> 33:03.124
You tried every form of persuasion?

33:03.166 --> 33:05.460
Emotional, spiritual, moral...

33:05.501 --> 33:09.922
Then it's time for legal. She does
not have the right to remain silent.

33:09.964 --> 33:14.635
- That's against self-incrimination.
- Forget for a second she's a victim.

33:14.677 --> 33:19.849
She is the only witness to a rape.
We'll get a material-witness order.

33:19.891 --> 33:25.271
And make her talk. We've never forced
a rape victim to testify who didn't wanna.

33:25.313 --> 33:27.231
You want this guy to walk?

33:34.655 --> 33:37.575
Ms Neal, please approach the bench.

33:44.999 --> 33:50.296
You have information necessary
to the investigation of a felony.

33:50.337 --> 33:52.631
- Yes, Your Honour.
- You were raped.

33:52.673 --> 33:55.509
You know the name of the man
who assaulted you.

33:55.551 --> 33:59.555
- Yes, Your Honour, I do.
- Would you tell the court his name?

33:59.597 --> 34:02.016
I would prefer not to.

34:02.057 --> 34:07.646
I will put you in civil jail
unless you cooperate. His name?

34:09.773 --> 34:14.320
- I respectfully decline to answer.
- You have information critical

34:14.360 --> 34:16.447
to a criminal investigation.

34:16.487 --> 34:20.743
Refusal to share it
constitutes contempt of court.

34:20.784 --> 34:26.165
Report to the Women's House
of Detention till this order is revoked.

34:26.206 --> 34:30.168
Bailiff, please remove the prisoner
from the court. Adjourned.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.799
You don't have to do this.

34:35.841 --> 34:40.429
I do. How do you know
what your values are until you're tested?

34:40.469 --> 34:42.806
- Just give me his name.
- No.

34:42.848 --> 34:47.893
You're trying to do what you think is right.
So am I. But we disagree.

34:54.067 --> 34:56.610
Are you OK?

34:56.652 --> 35:00.240
We just sent a rape victim to the lock-up.

35:00.282 --> 35:03.201
No, I'm not OK.

35:15.088 --> 35:18.174
- Commissioner Morris?
- Captain, we need to talk.

35:18.216 --> 35:20.176
Please close the door.

35:25.098 --> 35:28.059
You put a rape victim in the lock-up?

35:28.101 --> 35:32.063
- Yeah, we did.
- Every effort must be made to ensure

35:32.105 --> 35:35.984
the investigation of a crime
does not further traumatise the victim.

35:36.025 --> 35:38.945
- This is news?
- I know what you're doing.

35:38.987 --> 35:42.240
But I still have to file a letter of complaint.

35:42.282 --> 35:47.328
Who's putting you up to this?
The victims' rights groups? The press?

35:47.370 --> 35:52.917
The mayor and police commissioner.
I am taking flak from all sides!

35:52.959 --> 35:57.005
She's our only witness and she won't talk.
Our back is against the wall.

35:57.046 --> 36:02.218
I want to proceed in a way
that lets the victim retain her dignity.

36:02.260 --> 36:05.680
You wanna cover your ass
in case we don't bust this guy,

36:05.722 --> 36:08.599
which is increasingly likely
as we have no time left.

36:08.641 --> 36:12.395
- I resent the implication...
- I resent you waiting till ComStat

36:12.437 --> 36:15.815
- to tell me about the DNA.
- It was in the circular.

36:15.857 --> 36:18.067
You sat on it to make political hay,

36:18.109 --> 36:21.195
robbed me of time
I could have spent finding the perp.

36:21.237 --> 36:24.157
You are dangerously close
to insubordination.

36:24.198 --> 36:26.742
- Then either write me up...
- Or what?

36:26.784 --> 36:29.412
Or get out of my station house!

36:30.246 --> 36:33.916
Cos until you take this job away from me,
I've got work to do.

36:33.958 --> 36:39.255
If we don't find a name
for John Doe 121 by midnight, we never will.

36:45.302 --> 36:48.556
After Jennifer was attacked,
I counselled her.

36:48.597 --> 36:54.228
My role in the meeting is part time
and voluntary. I'm a psychologist.

36:54.270 --> 36:57.106
Did you advise her
not to cooperate with the police?

36:57.148 --> 37:01.986
No, never. I know the statistics
on recidivism as well as you do.

37:02.027 --> 37:05.197
I tried to persuade her
to put the man in prison.

37:05.239 --> 37:09.827
- It's not against Quaker philosophy?
- Not at all. Quakers sit on juries.

37:09.868 --> 37:13.038
Some are judges and lawyers.
Nixon was a Quaker.

37:13.080 --> 37:16.917
He put plenty of people in prison.
Some were even guilty.

37:18.043 --> 37:22.756
Jennifer's in jail because of this.
Do you think you could talk to her?

37:22.798 --> 37:25.676
I don't agree with what she did,

37:25.718 --> 37:28.387
but it was a decision of conscience.

37:28.429 --> 37:30.848
She persuaded me to stand aside.

37:30.889 --> 37:35.686
She prayed with her attacker.
He may be a member of your meeting.

37:35.727 --> 37:39.189
If we could see a list of members
we may be able to find him.

37:39.231 --> 37:42.484
- I'm sorry. I can't do that.
- Why not?

37:42.526 --> 37:47.114
This is a sanctuary.
We have a long history of civil disobedience.

37:47.155 --> 37:50.117
We opposed slavery, the Vietnam war...

37:50.158 --> 37:52.828
We're trying to stop a sexual predator.

37:52.869 --> 37:54.913
I hope you do, but not like that.

37:54.955 --> 37:59.292
If I give you a list, it compromises
our members' privacy forever.

37:59.334 --> 38:03.588
- We can get a warrant to compel you.
- If you have to do that,

38:03.630 --> 38:05.966
get your warrant.

38:06.007 --> 38:09.886
But be prepared.
When you return I won't be alone.

38:16.852 --> 38:22.190
Other circumstances,
I might be on the steps protesting the police.

38:22.232 --> 38:26.903
- I'm very uncomfortable about this.
- It's OK. We're not the bad guys.

38:29.364 --> 38:33.702
Mr Garrick? It's Detective Benson.
Please let us in.

38:33.743 --> 38:37.330
Sir, it's NYPD. We have a search warrant.

38:39.457 --> 38:43.086
Mr Garrick, don't make this
more difficult than it has to be.

39:00.311 --> 39:02.730
The office is probably in the back.

39:02.772 --> 39:07.026
I urge you, please, turn around,
go back to the police station.

39:07.068 --> 39:09.237
Or sit in worship with us.

39:21.833 --> 39:26.003
- Excuse me.
- Please, don't do this. We all value

39:26.045 --> 39:30.466
- the separation of Church and State.
- A man raped three women.

39:30.508 --> 39:36.138
He entered their apartments
as they slept and forced himself on them.

39:36.180 --> 39:40.726
I'm just trying to bring him to justice,
so excuse me.

39:46.107 --> 39:49.026
Ma'am, please give this to me.

39:51.946 --> 39:54.031
Thank you.

39:58.828 --> 40:05.292
We narrowed down the messengers
to 36 who were working at the time.

40:05.334 --> 40:09.296
We're looking for a match
with the church membership list.

40:09.338 --> 40:11.840
A through F.

40:11.882 --> 40:15.344
All right. Let's go, people.
We got a little over six hours.

40:32.444 --> 40:35.322
I have a Harvey Denis with one N.

40:35.364 --> 40:39.326
- On the bike list it has two Ns.
- I got the original.

40:39.368 --> 40:42.204
I'll check this out.

40:42.246 --> 40:46.667
Harvey Dennis. Two Ns, not one.

40:48.377 --> 40:51.964
Got the employment application in there?

40:52.005 --> 40:57.636
Yeah, yeah. Harvey Denis, one N.
The owner must have copied it wrong.

40:57.678 --> 40:59.763
I'll go with one N.

41:06.853 --> 41:09.147
Bingo.

41:09.189 --> 41:13.193
Here he is with that spelling.
Arrested February 21st '95

41:13.235 --> 41:15.821
for attempted... burglary.

41:15.862 --> 41:21.952
Burglary? The guy was going in
for rape number four and he got caught.

41:21.993 --> 41:26.623
- Did he serve any time?
- 15 months. Paroled September '96

41:26.665 --> 41:31.920
cos he was hospitalised for forcible
sexual injury during incarceration.

41:31.962 --> 41:36.841
- Ah, he was raped in prison.
- I'll cry later. Here's his address.

41:40.011 --> 41:45.183
He was right under our nose.
I walk past this place every day.

41:45.225 --> 41:50.855
Five hours left. I wanna see his face
when he knows he's going down.

42:00.615 --> 42:04.118
- May I help you?
- We're looking for Harvey Denis.

42:04.160 --> 42:08.957
- I'm right here.
- You're under arrest for the crime of rape.

42:08.998 --> 42:11.542
Stand up.
Put your hands where we can see them.

42:11.584 --> 42:14.045
Hands up! Up!

42:14.087 --> 42:16.631
Whoa! Don't shoot.

42:16.673 --> 42:19.592
I'm gonna buzz you in.

42:28.309 --> 42:30.895
You got me.

42:39.987 --> 42:44.909
Just lift me in. It doesn't hurt.
I feel nothing from the ribcage down.

42:46.452 --> 42:50.373
- How did it happen?
- I was on my bike, 11th and 3rd.

42:50.414 --> 42:55.419
Pick-up took a right.
The big side mirror smashed my spine.

42:57.963 --> 43:01.675
The chair folds up.
You can put it in the trunk.

43:01.717 --> 43:05.137
You have the right to remain silent.
If you refuse that right,

43:05.179 --> 43:09.308
anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

43:09.350 --> 43:11.477
You have the right to an attorney...
