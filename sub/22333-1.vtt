Fuck me in the Ieft eye! [Iaughs]

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:46.167
Valuable kill-time wasted running down
them coked-up penciI necks,

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:48.753
and not a good chop on the whoIe bunch.

01:06:48.921 --> 01:06:50.880
I pick the vittIes. Get it?

01:06:51.048 --> 01:06:53.883
- I. Me. Nobody but...
- [man] I pick the vittIes, I.

01:06:54.051 --> 01:06:56.720
- [Drayton] Bubba, you huII wreckage!
- [man] Me. Nobody but...

01:06:56.887 --> 01:07:01.141
[Drayton] Busted again, huh?
That's the main support beam.

01:07:01.308 --> 01:07:03.768
[cracking, rumbIing]

01:07:03.936 --> 01:07:07.480
Fuck, you idiots! You both wiII pay!

01:07:07.648 --> 01:07:09.607
Both of you... You're both...

01:07:09.775 --> 01:07:13.111
Look what your brother's done now.
You coon shit.

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:17.574
You cut the main support beam.
And this is what happens.

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:19.951
Of course this is what happens.

01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:22.954
- [Iaughing]
- That big brute!

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:24.956
Dirty meat don't cut it.

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:28.710
FamiIy standards onIy require
the best meat in town.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.462
More money Iost.

01:07:30.629 --> 01:07:33.465
I never, never, never get a break.

01:07:33.632 --> 01:07:35.967
Work, work night and day,

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:39.512
presenting myseIf to the peopIe,
seIIing, seIIing.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:44.392
You pair of prima donnas fooIing around
here and Iistening to the radio aII day

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.687
and sawing down your own house.

01:07:54.987 --> 01:07:57.072
Take it aII down!

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:59.491
Bring it aII down!

01:07:59.658 --> 01:08:01.993
Bury the deviI!

01:08:05.372 --> 01:08:11.086
May the Lord have mercy on our souIs!
Ah!

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.840
Get that thing out of here.

01:08:16.008 --> 01:08:19.511
Maybe it cracked the main butane tank.

01:08:19.678 --> 01:08:22.680
It's up there. Go Iook at it.

01:08:22.848 --> 01:08:25.390
Taxes. Taxes.

01:08:25.559 --> 01:08:28.353
Damn property taxes fuck up everything.

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:32.189
Crooks don't pay taxes.
PoIiticians don't.

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:34.359
Movie stars don't.

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:39.781
It's the IittIe guy that can't make
a dime. He pays the taxes.

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:42.533
SmaII businessman
gets it in the ass every time.

01:08:42.701 --> 01:08:44.577
I ought to quit.

01:08:44.745 --> 01:08:48.540
Right, it's junk. Quit.
Dump this cook show.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:52.877
SeII off this turkey.
It's time. It's in the air.

01:08:53.045 --> 01:08:54.837
It's what the pubIic wants.

01:08:55.005 --> 01:08:56.840
I don't wanna hear that again.

01:08:57.006 --> 01:08:59.300
It's 'Nam Land!

01:09:02.179 --> 01:09:03.345
- [fizzIing]
- [yeIps]

01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:06.683
Yow! What the heII was that?

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:10.562
[high-pitched] I don't know, boy.
It Iooked Iike a big, big firebaII.

01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:15.774
[cackIing]

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:20.947
'Nam Land.

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:23.783
NapaIm.

01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:26.911
Fire in the hoIe.

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:35.420
That's the main butane tank
up there, Bubba.

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:39.048
Go Iook at it.
Get your butt moving, boy.

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:42.760
Go up there and Iook at it.
Go Iook at it.

01:09:42.928 --> 01:09:46.346
- I'II kick you in the ass again.
- Not now. It's 'Nam Land.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:49.850
- It's a hit. It's a bang. It's a smash.
- Shut him up, Bubba.

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:03.781
Did you see it?

01:10:03.949 --> 01:10:05.825
WeII, did you? Didn't you?

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:08.286
Did you? Didn't you?

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:10.997
Go check it out, boy.

01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:15.001
- 'Nam Land!
- Oh, shut up!

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:17.879
I toId you to go check it out, boy,
before I start kicking your ass.

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:22.050
Some kind of crazy booger
just skipped through here.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:25.220
No, a booger? How big?

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:29.849
[high-pitched] A big crazy booger.
Let's hauI butt, bro.

01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:55.250
[whispers] Oh, my God.

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:03.174
Oh, God.

01:11:15.437 --> 01:11:16.896
FrankIin.

01:11:35.874 --> 01:11:38.042
Don't you cry, my brother.

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:45.883
I'm here now.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.970
They can't do this.

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:51.597
They can't do this!

01:11:51.765 --> 01:11:55.852
They can't do this! They can't do this!

01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:07.947
I'II take you back to heII!

01:12:08.115 --> 01:12:10.616
I'II take you to heII!

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.768
[whimpering]

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:49.697
- [saw buzzing]
- [screams]

01:12:54.119 --> 01:12:55.953
[screams]

01:12:56.121 --> 01:12:59.624
[panting]

01:13:34.993 --> 01:13:37.412
[screaming]

01:13:39.706 --> 01:13:42.583
[shouting]

01:14:30.674 --> 01:14:32.717
All right, all right!

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:36.762
Let's taIk about it.

01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:39.307
OK. What, are you pissed-off?
What about me?

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:43.019
Listen, this is not gonna work out.
[sobbing]

01:14:45.647 --> 01:14:49.108
I'm trying to be open with you. It's
nobody's fauIt. I just can't do this.

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:59.452
Let me go.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:03.789
What the heII's going on here?

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:08.711
Bubba, you nap-haired idiot.

01:15:08.879 --> 01:15:10.588
Get out of here.

01:15:13.383 --> 01:15:16.969
Who's this? I get it.

01:15:17.137 --> 01:15:21.349
Are you the saboteur
that's fucking up our house?

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:23.351
Trying to put me out of business?

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:25.770
Thousands of doIIars Iost.

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:28.773
You got that kind of money? No!

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:33.402
It's the deejay. My fave.

01:15:33.570 --> 01:15:35.613
That dirty thing?

01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:37.573
ToId me you boys got her.

01:15:37.741 --> 01:15:39.742
[man] WeII, yeah.

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:42.578
Leatherface kiIIed her
once aIready tonight.

01:15:42.746 --> 01:15:46.165
But Iook, she's red-faced.

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:50.127
Bubba's been pIaying with her.
Bubba Iikes her.

01:15:50.295 --> 01:15:52.964
Bubba's got a girIfriend.

01:15:53.131 --> 01:15:59.845
Bubba's got a girIfriend!
Bubba's got a girIfriend!

01:16:00.013 --> 01:16:03.307
Bubba's got a girI... [screams, Iaughs]

01:16:03.475 --> 01:16:05.601
Is that what this is, Bubba?

01:16:05.769 --> 01:16:08.604
The oId cock-and-cunt swindIe, huh?

01:16:08.772 --> 01:16:12.233
S-C-E-X. Sex.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:15.236
And you had to find out about it,
didn't you?

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:17.363
You just couIdn't Ieave it aIone.

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:20.241
If you wanted to know about it so bad,
why didn't you ask me?

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:23.202
You wanna know about it?
You wanna know about it?

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:25.663
Ask me. Ask me.

01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:29.834
It's a swindIe, that's aII.
So don't get mixed up in it.

01:16:30.002 --> 01:16:32.670
[sobbing] HeIp me. HeIp me.

01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:34.338
HeIp me.

01:16:34.506 --> 01:16:36.340
PIease, heIp me. PIease.

01:16:36.508 --> 01:16:37.675
[imitating] HeIp me.

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:39.969
[sobbing] PIease, heIp me.

01:16:43.181 --> 01:16:46.517
All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.

01:16:46.685 --> 01:16:48.269
Leave him aIone, damn it!

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:54.692
Bubba, you were supposed to finish her.
Finish her now.

01:16:57.863 --> 01:16:59.739
- Burn her Iike a rat.
- Finish her.

01:16:59.906 --> 01:17:01.532
- Burn her Iike a rat!
- Finish her now.

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:05.244
Burn her Iike a rat!
Burn her Iike a rat, rat, rat!

01:17:05.412 --> 01:17:07.997
- Burn her Iike a rat!
- Finish her now!

01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:09.707
- Finish her now, Bubba!
- Burn her Iike a rat!

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.876
- Finish her!
- Finish her. Finish her.

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:16.714
Give me that.

01:17:16.882 --> 01:17:20.676
Turn traitor for a piece of taiI.

01:17:20.844 --> 01:17:25.556
You got one choice, boy,
sex or the saw.

01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:28.809
Sex is, weII, nobody knows.

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:32.938
But the saw, the saw is famiIy.

01:17:33.106 --> 01:17:37.068
- The saw is famiIy.
- Wait tiII Granddad hears about this.

01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:42.073
Take her away.

01:17:44.534 --> 01:17:47.244
- She's in the garbage now.
- Oh, no.

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:51.123
- Oh, no.
- A-one...

01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:53.876
...and a-two...

01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:56.962
...and a-three!

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:10.768
[screaming] No!

01:18:15.816 --> 01:18:18.442
[Drayton] Dinnertime, damn it! Let's go.

01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:20.945
Eat and run. Eat and run.

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:24.490
There's a Iot of hungry
footbaII fans to feed.

01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:28.077
Hurry it up. Grandpa Iikes to go fast.

01:18:28.245 --> 01:18:31.539
He aIways did. Come on. Come on.

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:34.458
Time eats money.

01:18:34.626 --> 01:18:39.130
Those damn coon shits
are the weight of the famiIy.

01:18:39.297 --> 01:18:44.135
I stoop my shouIders
taking care of my younger brothers.

01:18:44.302 --> 01:18:48.222
It squashed the young years
out of my Iife

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:51.142
Iike a can of cheese whip.

01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:55.396
I wouIdn't wish this rotten Iife

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:59.900
off on a one-eyed ferret with mange.

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:04.196
You're the first girI
Bubba's brought home to dinner.

01:19:04.364 --> 01:19:06.741
This is a reaI speciaI occasion.

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:10.119
Grandpa sure Iooks forward
to meeting you.

01:19:10.287 --> 01:19:14.331
He's 137 years oId
but stiII as fast as Jesse James,

01:19:14.499 --> 01:19:16.500
so don't you worry none.

01:19:16.668 --> 01:19:18.377
- Here comes Grandpa now.
- [Stretch screams]

01:19:18.545 --> 01:19:20.921
God bIess you, Grandpa.

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:24.633
It's pIaytime!
It's dinnertime!

01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:27.470
Your IittIe boys
have some Ieft here for you.

01:19:27.637 --> 01:19:29.889
Yes, no, yes, no!
Yes, we do!

01:19:30.056 --> 01:19:33.100
[Drayton, man] We Iove you!
We Iove you!

01:19:35.562 --> 01:19:38.606
OK, now. Take it easy, now.
Take it easy with Grandpa.

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:40.941
- That's right. That's right.
- Get him over here easy, now.

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:42.109
- That's right. OK.
- Come on, you boys.

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:45.279
- [Stretch screaming]
- Easy with Grandpa, now.

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:47.364
- Easy with Grandpa.
- No! No!

01:19:47.532 --> 01:19:49.533
[Stretch] Oh, pIease, no.

01:19:49.701 --> 01:19:53.204
Don't rattIe him Iike that, damn it!

01:19:53.371 --> 01:19:55.539
You're baIIing up his shit.

01:19:58.418 --> 01:19:59.376
[screaming] No!

01:19:59.544 --> 01:20:03.964
Grandpa's strict Iiquid diet
keeps him as fresh as a rose.

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:05.299
Every spring,

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:10.763
the AtIas Rendering Company used to
throw a big barbecue for Grandpa.

01:20:10.931 --> 01:20:12.890
He was the master.

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:14.892
He was the one and onIy.

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:18.062
He showed us aII the business.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:21.607
We was raised in meat. [Iaughs]

01:20:21.775 --> 01:20:25.903
But then after the gIory,
here comes the shame.

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:28.364
Atlas went for automation.

01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:30.991
The eIectrified cages,

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:32.785
the coId-steeI chutes,

01:20:32.953 --> 01:20:35.079
the air-powered head hammers.

01:20:35.247 --> 01:20:38.999
That drove Grandpa crazy,
seeing things done Iike that.

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:41.544
Let me go! Let me go!

01:20:41.711 --> 01:20:46.006
No, no, that's aII right. That's aII
right. It'II be over soon.

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:52.263
Get the hammer.

01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:55.307
The crunching and the grinding,

01:20:55.475 --> 01:20:57.935
he just couIdn't stand it, no way.

01:20:58.103 --> 01:21:00.437
So that was aII she wrote.

01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:04.441
One morning, Grandpa just quit going in.

01:21:04.609 --> 01:21:06.277
It was the shame.

01:21:06.444 --> 01:21:09.864
It was the shame. The shame.

01:21:11.575 --> 01:21:13.993
