10:23.664 --> 10:25.541
Which means I'm not gonna
be going after everything.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.626
I'm just gonna let
whatever comes to me come to me.

10:27.626 --> 10:31.005
And without a platform
on which to be contacted,

10:31.005 --> 10:33.841
how do you expect
that to happen? Osmosis?

10:33.841 --> 10:35.134
I'm excited to see.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.136
Love the overalls.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.351
- Time for your next meeting.
- Hmm.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.271
Now do you see
why I defected on Halloween?

10:47.271 --> 10:48.773
I saw this crash coming.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.733
Now you pulled me back in,
and I'm collateral.

10:50.733 --> 10:51.609
Thanks so much.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.910
Do you think
I'm doing the wrong thing,
giving it up to God

11:00.910 --> 11:02.661
or whatever people
who believe in that stuff say?

11:02.661 --> 11:04.997
The only reason
that New Year's even exists

11:04.997 --> 11:06.248
besides that pagan thing
that no one talks about...

11:06.248 --> 11:08.250
- Hmm.
- ...is for the world

11:08.250 --> 11:10.336
to give us permission
to try something new.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.588
So, like, on any given Monday,
you can say you're going vegan,

11:12.588 --> 11:14.423
but in January
everyone believes you.

11:14.423 --> 11:15.549
I mean, look at me.

11:15.549 --> 11:16.926
Two weeks ago, if I said
I was in a queer relationship,

11:16.926 --> 11:20.137
everyone would probably accuse
me of trying to center myself.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.514
But in January,
I'm speaking factually!

11:21.514 --> 11:23.099
How is that going?

11:23.099 --> 11:24.517
Oh, my God. It's like
a constant endorphin rush.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.103
Nothing can put me
in a bad mood.

11:27.686 --> 11:27.812
Even that.

11:30.022 --> 11:30.981
Hey, Z!

11:31.732 --> 11:33.192
Trouble in Buffalo?

11:33.192 --> 11:34.777
I mean, things have been
a little tense

11:34.777 --> 11:35.736
the last 24 hours.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.530
But that's what happens
when three people

11:37.530 --> 11:39.448
share a bathroom.

11:39.448 --> 11:41.659
Speaking of sharing,
can we talk about it yet?

11:41.659 --> 11:43.202
People are gonna
lose their minds.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.954
We're trying
to keep it low-pro, okay?

11:44.954 --> 11:47.373
It's still so new--

11:47.373 --> 11:49.959
And it looks like people
have already lost their minds.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.502
What is this?

11:53.170 --> 11:54.797
Does anyone
really believe this shit?

11:54.797 --> 11:55.631
"Noble O really paid people

11:55.631 --> 11:59.135
to protest outside
432 Park in 2019"?

11:59.135 --> 12:00.469
I think that actually happened.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.179
I wonder how
Gossip Girl found out.

12:02.179 --> 12:05.015
Who cares? This account is
more dated than Diet Prada.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.225
I don't even know why I still
have post notifications on.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.811
I don't mind GG.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.896
I learned a lesson from her
putting our shit out there.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.815
Secrets just blow up
in our faces.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.066
Easy for you to say.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.360
My secret requires
three-factor authentication.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.487
Even if we all agreed,

12:18.487 --> 12:20.823
I'm not sure I want it
to be public knowledge.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.908
Right. 'Cause relationships
always work out

12:22.908 --> 12:24.243
when you have to lie about them.

12:24.243 --> 12:28.038
Excuse me, but I wasn't aware
that they work when you don't.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.166
How is Obie, by the way?

12:30.166 --> 12:31.834
Have you heard from him?
Has anyone?

12:31.834 --> 12:34.628
It's just advice.
Do whatever you want.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.714
I don't need permission,
and I am.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.729
Uh, which thing? I'll get it.

12:51.729 --> 12:52.730
Yeah,
just gimme a hand?

12:54.064 --> 12:55.065
Hey!

12:56.108 --> 12:57.359
Don't worry about the plants.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.819
Those are my things!

12:58.819 --> 13:01.739
Wh-- Why are you taking them
out of my room?

13:01.739 --> 13:03.824
Uh, you've been relocated.

13:03.824 --> 13:07.203
- Sorry, who are you?
- Mike Shubin. Russian Classics.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.371
And this is my room,
always has been.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.207
I've been here
for the last two years.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.376
While I was on sabbatical.
But now I'm back.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.046
You lucked out. Most teachers
start subterranean.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.673
Pro tip. Put an air freshener
in the ceiling vent, uh,

13:19.673 --> 13:22.676
helps mask
the essence of mildew.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.059
- Shubes!
- Hey!

13:30.059 --> 13:31.602
Hi! My mom is gonna be
so happy you're back.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.812
Already have dinner
on the books.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.523
- Oh, good.
- Looking forward to it.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.775
- How you doing?
- I've been good.
How are you?

13:42.988 --> 13:45.074
It's you! Miss Keller.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.951
My guidance counselor
for college?

13:46.951 --> 13:48.577
It says we got assigned.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.371
What do you think
my odds are?

13:50.371 --> 13:51.747
Right. Um...

13:51.747 --> 13:54.333
Our first meeting
isn't till later this week...

13:54.333 --> 13:57.419
...but how are your
extracurriculars?

13:57.753 --> 13:58.963
Um...

13:58.963 --> 14:01.632
I've volunteered publicly.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.968
- Does that help me stand out?
- Mmm...

14:06.011 --> 14:08.097
Um,

14:08.097 --> 14:10.599
just because something is public
doesn't mean it matters.

14:10.599 --> 14:13.185
Who are you without Instagram?

14:13.185 --> 14:14.937
I'm thinking about that...

14:14.937 --> 14:17.356
...for the first... time.

14:18.899 --> 14:22.069
Anyway, I'm, uh, really excited
to be working with you.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.529
Me too.

14:26.323 --> 14:27.783
Have you seen this?

14:27.783 --> 14:29.910
-"Lunet used to make out?"
- Hmm?

14:29.910 --> 14:33.539
What kind of ship name is that?
We clearly would be Mona.

14:33.539 --> 14:34.999
Is she a good kisser?

14:34.999 --> 14:37.793
It's-- It's not true!
None of it.

14:37.793 --> 14:39.753
Gossip Girl's gone
full Facebook.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.298
But wait, if...

14:42.298 --> 14:43.757
if you believe her,
then who's to say

14:43.757 --> 14:46.010
that she doesn't have the power
to make Julien popular again?

14:46.010 --> 14:47.261
That won't happen.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.138
People will be bored
by Gossip Girl by then.

14:49.138 --> 14:52.308
Everybody loves a dumpster fire.
She hasn't lost one follower.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.892
If I'm going
to take Julien's place,

14:53.892 --> 14:58.522
I need Gossip Girl
to make my assumption public.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.941
The guillotine was placed
in the town square for a reason.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.651
You didn't just kill your enemy,

15:02.651 --> 15:05.738
you struck fear
in everyone else as well.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.990
Are you still going
to the debutante ball with me?

15:07.990 --> 15:09.074
I would follow you
through the gates of hell.

15:09.074 --> 15:12.745
Good. Because you both
will have very important roles

15:12.745 --> 15:14.079
when we get there.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.832
Come Sunday,
Julien's head will roll,

15:16.832 --> 15:19.418
and the crown
that she never respected

15:19.418 --> 15:22.296
will finally... be on mine.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.048
♪ ("THAT'S WHERE I AM"
BY MAGGIE ROGERS PLAYS) ♪

15:24.048 --> 15:25.507
Uh, hey. How much for an eighth?

15:25.507 --> 15:27.509
Supply chain issues. Get lost.

15:27.509 --> 15:28.677
Bye-bye.

15:28.677 --> 15:31.430
That is the third time
this morning.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.848
Oh, just means your cred's up.

15:32.848 --> 15:35.559
Check it. I'm wearing
the mood ring we fished out

15:35.559 --> 15:38.228
from the tracks of the C.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.481
I've been purple-excited
to see you all morning.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.649
Right.

15:41.649 --> 15:42.775
Plus my knuckle
has been tingling,

15:42.775 --> 15:44.693
so I may lick it later
and see what happens.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.363
I thought you were gonna wear

15:47.363 --> 15:49.198
the earring we found
in your pizza.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.240
Couldn't find 'em.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.534
I've had trouble finding
anything now that my bedroom

15:52.534 --> 15:54.703
has been turned
into a Farfetch warehouse.

15:54.703 --> 15:57.081
Ugh!
That girl is on another level.

15:57.081 --> 15:57.748
And my dad
doesn't even seem to notice.

15:57.748 --> 16:00.084
Actually, he notices her plenty.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.293
It's just me
that's turned invisible.

16:02.086 --> 16:02.920
Okay, so Jules is his favorite.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.881
- He doesn't have a favorite.
- All parents do.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.133
And it's best to know
exactly where you stand.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.135
- Aren't you an only child?
- No.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.553
I just have only child energy.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.890
Right. Well,

16:14.890 --> 16:16.642
I know I campaigned
for her to live with us,

16:16.642 --> 16:19.228
but I forgot how much space
she takes up, literally.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.562
My dad and I just...

16:20.562 --> 16:21.939
...need to spend
some alone time together,

16:21.939 --> 16:24.024
which we're gonna
do this Saturday.

16:24.024 --> 16:26.485
You know, the cheapest tickets
at TKTS and Xi'an's Famous,

16:26.485 --> 16:28.696
just the two of us.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.573
Look, you made those plans
before she moved in.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.784
If I were you, I'd confirm.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.288
- Now they're wearing overalls?
- Yeah.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.168
You're all looking
at Gossip Girl

16:43.168 --> 16:44.086
as if tipgate never happened.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.589
When the goss is this good,
all is forgiven.

16:47.589 --> 16:49.717
Only 'cause no one's talking
about you.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.428
<i>Spotted.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.699
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:14.783 --> 17:17.119
- Oh, I love macarons.
- Great news.

17:17.119 --> 17:22.458
I was able to pull some strings
and got you added last-minute

17:22.458 --> 17:24.752
as a debutante this Saturday.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.628
Did someone tell you
I'd be interested in that?

17:26.628 --> 17:27.963
'Cause I'm not.

17:27.963 --> 17:30.424
Deb balls are outdated
and problematic.

17:30.424 --> 17:33.469
Well, they used to be,
until my mom got on the board

17:33.469 --> 17:37.473
and gave it a refresh.
Now, they don't only include

17:37.473 --> 17:40.309
high-achieving women of color
like ourselves,

17:40.309 --> 17:42.978
but all proceeds go to charity.

17:42.978 --> 17:46.148
I mean, who doesn't love
a chance to look stunning

17:46.148 --> 17:47.941
while-- while helping the world?

17:47.941 --> 17:50.027
Old me would've jumped,
but new me

17:50.027 --> 17:51.820
just really isn't looking
for that kind of attention.

17:51.820 --> 17:55.157
So... thanks, but no thanks.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.160

has consequences, right?

18:05.417 --> 18:09.296
Plus, hot guys!
Ugh! If you're into that.

18:09.296 --> 18:13.050
Ms. Keller did seem underwhelmed
by my extracurriculars.

18:13.050 --> 18:16.512

It's in Hudson Yards.

Hennessy bottle, though.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.088
Hmm. It's gorgeous!

18:51.088 --> 18:53.799
It also worth
half a year's tuition.

What does this man do
that gets him all this?

18:56.802 --> 18:59.054
Maybe it's just
the price to look at him.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.931
Something big is going down

19:00.931 --> 19:03.016
at the debutante ball
this weekend.

19:03.016 --> 19:05.394
I'm sorry. Did I just
involuntarily time travel?

19:05.394 --> 19:06.895
Did you say "debutante ball"?

19:06.895 --> 19:08.313
My deb ball
got shut down,

19:08.313 --> 19:10.566
and by "shut down,"
I mean raided by the FBI.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.150
I need to be on the inside.

19:12.150 --> 19:15.487
Why? You got what you wanted.
Tips are flowing again.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.613
I can only keep peddling

19:16.613 --> 19:19.283
Julien's false rumors
for so long.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.909
What better way to keep up
Gossip Girl's momentum

19:20.909 --> 19:23.912
than an unsanctioned
live stream?

19:23.912 --> 19:25.914
I see. This is about Camille.

19:25.914 --> 19:29.751
How dare you even suggest that?

19:29.751 --> 19:31.837
Is that really
what you think of me?

19:31.837 --> 19:33.922
Okay, fine. I'll play along.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.924
So, how exactly do you plan
on getting in?

19:35.924 --> 19:37.885
Right through the front door.

on my college apps.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.765
Any college that cares about you
attending a deb ball

20:24.765 --> 20:26.850
isn't a college
