WEBVTT

00:12.333 --> 00:14.467
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.500 --> 00:16.400
(Meredith) I HAVE A FEELING.
(Cristina)
WHAT KIND OF FEELING?

00:16.433 --> 00:18.467
LIKE I MIGHT DIE.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.567
(Meredith) HELLO?
CLEARLY NOT MY DREAM.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.700
MY CONTRACTIONS
ARE TEN MINUTES APART

00:22.733 --> 00:25.333
AND MY WATER JUST BROKE
ALL OVER YOUR SHOES.

00:25.367 --> 00:27.833
WHY CAN'T WE CALL EACH OTHER
BY OUR FIRST NAME?
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:27.867 --> 00:30.167
DO YOU KNOW I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME WE KISSED?

00:30.200 --> 00:32.200
WHERE IS MY HUSBAND?
GOT INTO A CAR ACCIDENT

00:32.233 --> 00:34.700
TRYING TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL
BEFORE THE BIRTH.
IS MY WIFE HERE?

00:34.733 --> 00:37.067
THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE
ANY BABY BORN TODAY.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.100
MEREDITH AND CRISTINA
ARE DOERS.

00:39.133 --> 00:40.833
THEY'RE DOERS.
I'M HORNY, I'M HALF-NAKED
AND I'M SAYING YES.

00:40.867 --> 00:42.767
YOU WANT TO STAND THERE
AND TALK METAPHORS,

00:42.800 --> 00:45.333
OR DO YOU WANT TO LITERALLY
TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS?

00:45.367 --> 00:48.300
A QUIET BOARD MEANS TROUBLE.
A QUIET BOARD IS DEATH.

00:48.333 --> 00:49.300
HANNAH. HANNAH DAVIES.

00:49.333 --> 00:52.067
WHY DO YOU HAVE YOUR HAND
INSIDE MY PATIENT?

00:52.100 --> 00:54.433
MY HUSBAND HAS TO GO AND STAND
IN FRONT OF HIS BIG GUN--

00:54.467 --> 00:56.333
(Alex) HE SHOT HIMSELF
WITH A BAZOOKA?

00:56.367 --> 00:58.300
WAS THERE AN EXPLOSION?
NO.

00:58.333 --> 01:01.433
SO I'M TOUCHING LIVE,
UNEXPLODED AMMUNITION?

01:01.467 --> 01:03.633
AS OF TEN MINUTES AGO,
ALL THE OPERATING ROOMS

01:03.667 --> 01:05.567
AT SEATTLE GRACE
ARE COMPLETELY EVACUATED

01:05.600 --> 01:07.800
WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF DR. BURKE'S TEAM.
AND DR. SHEPHERD'S TEAM.

01:07.833 --> 01:09.433
I'M NOT LEAVING
BAILEY'S HUSBAND

01:09.467 --> 01:12.267
ON THE TABLE
WITH HIS SKULL FLAP OPEN.
PINK MIST.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.067
THAT'S WHAT THE BOMB SQUAD
CALLS YOU WHEN YOU BLOW UP.

01:15.067 --> 01:17.200
DYLAN YOUNG, BOMB SQUAD.
THAT DEVICE IS HOMEMADE,

01:17.233 --> 01:19.133
WHICH MEANS IT'S UNSTABLE
AND VERY UNRELIABLE.

01:19.167 --> 01:22.067
I AM 22 YEARS OLD.
SHE'S PANICKING.
WE NEED TO CLEAR THE ROOM.

01:22.067 --> 01:23.667
THIS IS SOME KIND OF MISTAKE.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.700
I HAVE TO!

01:27.633 --> 01:29.733
OH, WHAT DID I DO?
WHAT DID I DO? WHAT DID I DO?

01:29.767 --> 01:31.500
***

01:31.533 --> 01:34.600
(Meredith) IN HOSPITALS,
THEY SAY YOU KNOW.

01:34.633 --> 01:38.200
YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO DIE.

01:38.233 --> 01:42.267
SOME DOCTORS SAY IT'S A LOOK
PATIENTS GET IN THEIR EYES.

01:42.300 --> 01:46.300
SOME SAY THERE'S A SCENT,
THE SMELL OF DEATH.

01:46.333 --> 01:49.667
SOME THINK THERE'S JUST
SOME KIND OF SIXTH SENSE.

01:49.700 --> 01:52.567
WHEN THE GREAT BEYOND
IS HEADING FOR YOU,

01:52.600 --> 01:54.567
YOU FEEL IT COMING.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.367
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S CREEPY.

01:57.400 --> 02:02.400
BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW,
WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT?

02:02.433 --> 02:04.400
FORGET ABOUT THE FACT

02:04.433 --> 02:07.233
THAT YOU'RE SCARED
OUT OF YOUR MIND.

02:07.267 --> 02:09.067
***

02:09.067 --> 02:13.800
IF YOU KNEW THIS WAS
YOUR LAST DAY ON EARTH...

02:13.833 --> 02:16.600
HOW WOULD YOU
WANT TO SPEND IT?

02:16.633 --> 02:19.633
***

02:23.133 --> 02:24.333
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:24.367 --> 02:26.333
SOMETHING HAPPENED
IN O.R. THREE.
WHAT?

02:26.367 --> 02:28.200
I DON'T KNOW.

02:28.233 --> 02:30.767
ALL I KNOW IS THAT HANNAH,
THE PARAMEDIC, SHE'S MISSING.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.367
(George) CHIEF?

02:32.400 --> 02:33.767
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

02:33.800 --> 02:35.267
A QUIET BOARD.

02:35.300 --> 02:37.200
A QUIET BOARD IS
WHAT'S HAPPENED.

02:37.233 --> 02:40.600
***

02:45.267 --> 02:48.100
DR. SHEPHERD.

02:48.133 --> 02:49.533
DR. BURKE.

02:49.567 --> 02:51.233
HOW'S IT GOING?

02:51.267 --> 02:53.100
IF I DO
WHAT THE TEXTBOOKS SAY,

02:53.133 --> 02:55.333
HE COULD LOSE
THE POWER OF SPEECH,

02:55.367 --> 02:57.600
HERNIATE THROUGH
THE FIRST CRANIOTOMY AND DIE.

02:57.633 --> 02:58.833
WHAT'S YOUR OTHER OPTION?

02:58.867 --> 03:00.733
WELL, IF I DO
WHAT I WANT TO DO,

03:00.767 --> 03:02.667
HE COULD LOSE
THE POWER OF SPEECH,

03:02.700 --> 03:05.600
HERNIATE THROUGH
THE FIRST CRANIOTOMY AND DIE.

03:05.633 --> 03:08.300
YEAH.
WELL, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

03:08.333 --> 03:09.733
THANKS.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.600
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT?

03:13.633 --> 03:15.533
YOU KNOW, IT WAS
REALLY STUPID OF YOU

03:15.567 --> 03:17.067
NOT TO EVACUATE.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.067
HMM. YOU, TOO.

03:19.067 --> 03:20.800
YEAH, I KNOW.

03:20.833 --> 03:23.067
WE SHOULD CONSIDER
A CHANGE OF PROFESSION.

03:23.067 --> 03:24.567
YES, WE SHOULD.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.167
NOW CAN YOU OPERATE

03:26.200 --> 03:29.600
AND, UH, REMOVE THE DEVICE
FROM THE GUY?

03:29.633 --> 03:33.400
AFTER THE BOMB SQUAD
IS THROUGH ASSESSING HIM,

03:33.433 --> 03:35.367
I'M GOING TO TRY.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.267
GOTTA SAY,

03:40.300 --> 03:42.733
DON'T WANT TO BE THE GUY
THAT KILLS BAILEY'S HUSBAND.

03:42.767 --> 03:45.133
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE GUY
THAT KILLS US ALL.

03:48.733 --> 03:50.600
DR. SHEPHERD.

03:50.633 --> 03:53.167
DR. BURKE.

04:02.633 --> 04:05.800
YOU REALIZE HOW STUPID
THAT WAS?
IT WAS, MER.
INCREDIBLY STUPID.

04:05.833 --> 04:08.067
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHEN YOU
DON'T NEED TO BE MADE FUN OF?

04:08.100 --> 04:09.833
LIKE, WHEN YOU'VE GOT YOUR HAND
INSIDE A BODY

04:09.867 --> 04:11.300
THAT'S GOT A BOMB IN IT

04:11.333 --> 04:14.067
AND A STRANGER IS VELCROING
A FLAK JACKET TO YOUR BOOBS.
OKAY, OKAY.

04:14.067 --> 04:15.800
YOU'VE GOT A SENSE
OF IRONY.

04:15.833 --> 04:18.633
ONLY WHEN THINGS
ARE REALLY IRONIC.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.067
I HAD A FEELING.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.667
(Dylan) WHAT'S THAT?

04:28.367 --> 04:30.400
NOTHING.

04:51.433 --> 04:53.133
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.300
NO, I'M STAYING.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.233
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
YOU CAN DO HERE.

04:56.267 --> 04:57.833
WE'VE GOT IT COVERED.

04:57.867 --> 04:59.800
CRISTINA, THIS IS NOT
ANOTHER COOL SURGERY.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.733
THIS AMMO COULD GO OFF
AT ANY TIME

05:01.767 --> 05:03.767
AND KILL EVERYONE
IN THIS ROOM.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.467
DO YOU GET THAT?
YOU CANNOT BE IN HERE.

05:06.500 --> 05:09.533
YOU THINK THIS IS
ABOUT SURGERY?
CRISTINA, I CANNOT DO THIS
WITH YOU IN HERE.

05:09.567 --> 05:13.533
I CANNOT THINK.

05:18.467 --> 05:21.067
WE'LL BE FINE.

05:22.833 --> 05:25.333
IT'S OKAY.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.667
YOU KNOW IN THE MOVIES
HOW THERE'S ALWAYS THE HERO

05:35.700 --> 05:37.600
AND THEN THERE'S
THE OTHER GUY,

05:37.633 --> 05:39.167
THE GUY WHO SEES DANGER

05:39.200 --> 05:41.100
AND THEN RUNS
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION?

05:41.133 --> 05:43.133
YES.

05:43.167 --> 05:46.333
BE THE OTHER GUY.

06:04.433 --> 06:07.767
(exhales)

06:07.800 --> 06:10.833
SO YOU HAVE A PLAN,
RIGHT?

06:10.867 --> 06:14.067
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
GET ME OUTTA THIS, RIGHT?

06:28.233 --> 06:30.133
I FEEL LIKE COLORS
ARE BRIGHTER.

06:30.167 --> 06:32.067
DOES ANYONE FEEL LIKE
COLORS ARE BRIGHTER?

06:32.100 --> 06:33.633
MY HEAD HURTS.

06:33.667 --> 06:35.567
IT'S THE ADRENALINE.
DO YOU HAVE THE SMELL THING?

06:35.600 --> 06:38.300
'CAUSE I HAVE LIKE
THIS CRAZY--
SHUT UP!

06:38.333 --> 06:39.600
ARE YOU OKAY?

06:39.633 --> 06:41.533
(George) OF COURSE
SHE'S NOT OKAY.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.233
HOW COULD SHE POSSIBLY BE OKAY?
YOU'RE INSENSITIVE.

06:44.267 --> 06:46.400
I'M NOT INSENSITIVE.
WOULD YOU TWO
JUST SHUT UP?

06:46.433 --> 06:48.467
NOBODY CARES IF THE BLUE
IS BLUER

06:48.500 --> 06:50.400
OR IF YOU HAVE
SUPER SMELLING POWERS.

06:50.433 --> 06:52.100
MEREDITH COULD DIE.

06:52.133 --> 06:54.233
ANY MINUTE
SHE COULD JUST... DIE.

06:54.267 --> 06:57.367
ACTUALLY STOP LIVING.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.067
DEAD.

07:00.067 --> 07:02.433
A CORPSE.

07:05.300 --> 07:09.333
(laughs)

07:09.367 --> 07:12.400
OH, GO--I'M SORRY.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.333
GOD, I HAVE REALLY
INAPPROPRIATE REACTIONS

07:14.367 --> 07:15.700
TO THIS KIND OF STRESS.

07:15.733 --> 07:18.700
I'M SORRY. HOLD ON.
(clears throat)

07:18.733 --> 07:20.133
OKAY?

07:20.167 --> 07:21.767
YEAH.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.700
SHOULD WE, LIKE...
SHOULD WE, LIKE, DO SOMETHING?

07:23.733 --> 07:25.633
I MEAN,
CALL MEREDITH'S FAMILY?
WE ARE MEREDITH'S FAMILY.

07:25.667 --> 07:27.733
(laughs) I'M SORRY.

07:27.767 --> 07:30.767
I'M SORRY. (laughing)

07:38.667 --> 07:42.133
WE ARE MEREDITH'S FAMILY.

07:45.867 --> 07:47.833
THIS AREA'S BEEN EVACUATED,
DR. YANG.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.667
AND SOMEHOW
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.700
I HAVE TO BE HERE.
YOU DON'T.

07:51.733 --> 07:53.400
YES, I DO.

07:53.433 --> 07:54.600
DR. YANG--

07:54.633 --> 07:57.200
YES, I DO.

07:57.233 --> 07:58.833
BESIDES, I--

07:58.867 --> 08:02.067
I'M GUESSING YOU NEED
A LITTLE COMPANY.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.600
HOW'S HE DOING?

08:07.633 --> 08:09.767
HE'S HANGING IN THERE.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.600
HOW'S THAT PARAMEDIC
HANNAH DOING?

08:11.633 --> 08:12.667
HANNAH?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.633
THE GIRL WITH THE BOMB.

08:14.667 --> 08:18.067
SHE'S HANGING IN THERE, TOO.

08:19.467 --> 08:20.800
CALM DOWN.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.333
(Richard) CALM DOWN?

08:22.367 --> 08:24.267
I HAVE AN EVACUATED O.R.,
A BOMB IN A BODY CAVITY,

08:24.300 --> 08:25.633
A MISSING PARAMEDIC,

08:25.667 --> 08:28.733
AN INTERN WITH HER HAND
ON THE EXPLOSIVE,

08:28.767 --> 08:30.667
TWO WORLD-CLASS SURGEONS
IN HARM'S WAY,

08:30.700 --> 08:33.567
A MAN ON A TABLE WHO MAY
BLEED OUT AT ANY MOMENT

08:33.600 --> 08:35.600
UNLESS WE REMOVE THE BOMB
FROM HIS CHEST

08:35.633 --> 08:37.533
AND MY FAVORITE RESIDENT
IN LABOR,

08:37.567 --> 08:39.467
WHO YOU ARE NOW TELLING ME
REFUSES TO PUSH.

08:39.500 --> 08:40.600
REALLY? "CALM DOWN"?

08:40.633 --> 08:44.067
YOU REALLY WANT TO SAY
RIGHT NOW TO ME, "CALM DOWN"?

08:44.067 --> 08:45.367
OKAY, DON'T CALM DOWN.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.800
DR. BAILEY IS SCARED, SIR.
IT'S A DAY TO BE SCARED.

08:47.833 --> 08:50.700
SHE WON'T LET ME EXAMINE HER,
BUT FROM WHAT I CAN TELL,

08:50.733 --> 08:53.067
HER CONTRACTIONS
ARE 40 SECONDS APART,

08:53.100 --> 08:54.633
AND SHE IS REFUSING
TO PUSH.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.600
THE BABY
COULD GO INTO DISTRESS,

08:56.633 --> 08:58.533
AND IF SHE DOESN'T COME OUT
OF THIS, I MEAN, AND SOON,

08:58.567 --> 09:00.467
THEN I'M GONNA NEED AN O.R.
TO DO AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.400
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
AN O.R., ADDIE.

09:02.433 --> 09:03.500
I DON'T HAVE
AN O.R. TO GIVE.

09:03.533 --> 09:05.600
CAN'T YOU CONVINCE HER
TO PUSH? BAILEY'S RATIONAL.

09:05.633 --> 09:08.067
SHE'S NOT BAILEY RIGHT NOW.
SHE'S A WOMAN IN LABOR

09:08.100 --> 09:10.400
WHOSE HUSBAND IS IN SURGERY
NEXT TO A BOMB.

09:10.433 --> 09:12.433
SO IS YOURS.
THIS IS ABOUT BAILEY.

09:12.467 --> 09:14.367
I NEED AN O.R.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.300
LOOK, RICHARD, WE HAVE ABOUT
AN HOUR TO CHANGE BAILEY'S MIND.

09:17.333 --> 09:19.233
AND THEN I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO GET ME AN O.R.,

09:19.267 --> 09:21.167
BUILD ME AN O.R.,
FIND ME A HELICOPTER

09:21.200 --> 09:24.067
TO FLY ME TO ANY O.R.
IN THE CITY.

09:24.067 --> 09:27.400
OTHERWISE, INSTEAD OF HAVING
A BABY, SHE'LL BE LOSING ONE.

09:33.233 --> 09:36.333
HERE ARE THE BLUEPRINTS
YOU ASKED FOR, CHIEF.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.400
THANK YOU.

09:39.733 --> 09:42.733
***

09:50.633 --> 09:53.400
I LAUGH AT FUNERALS.

09:53.433 --> 09:55.733
I DON'T GO TO FUNERALS.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.800
IZZIE. IZ...

10:05.200 --> 10:08.200
***

10:12.333 --> 10:14.467
I WAS JEALOUS.

10:16.433 --> 10:20.500
I WAS JEALOUS OF MEREDITH
AND THE SURGERY. I...

10:20.533 --> 10:23.367
I-I WAS...

10:23.400 --> 10:25.533
JEALOUS, AND NOW...

10:28.067 --> 10:31.567
I WAS JEALOUS, ALEX.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.600
***

10:44.433 --> 10:46.100
IS THIS THE STRANGEST THING

10:46.133 --> 10:48.167
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED
IN YOUR O.R.?

10:48.200 --> 10:50.667
I'D HAVE TO SAY
THAT IT IS.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.133
GOOD.

10:52.167 --> 10:53.800
'CAUSE I'M VERY COMPETITIVE.

10:53.833 --> 10:57.533
ALL THE BEST SURGEONS ARE.

10:57.567 --> 11:00.833
***

11:00.867 --> 11:02.733
DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD
JUST TALKED TO THE CHIEF.

11:02.767 --> 11:04.667
THEY'RE REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.533
SHE'S ON THE PHONE
WITH MERCY WEST RIGHT NOW

11:06.567 --> 11:08.467
TO SEE IF THEY HAVE
ANY O.R.s AVAILABLE.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.333
I NEED SOMEONE
TO DRIVE ME HOME.

11:10.367 --> 11:12.367
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING
AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.300
THEY CAN TALK ALL THEY WANT.
I'M NOT GOING TO MERCY WEST.

11:14.333 --> 11:17.133
THE BABY IS NOT COMING OUT.
I NEED A RIDE.

11:17.167 --> 11:19.467
I CAN'T FOCUS ENOUGH
TO DRIVE MYSELF,

11:19.500 --> 11:21.767
AND TUCKER...

11:21.800 --> 11:23.333
I NEED A RIDE.

11:23.367 --> 11:24.767
YOU COULD LOSE IT.
YOU KNOW THIS.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.667
I TOLD YOU ALREADY, I'M NOT
HAVING THIS BABY UNTIL TOMORROW.

11:27.700 --> 11:30.233
THIS BABY COULD DIE
BEFORE IT'S EVEN BORN.
CAN YOU GIVE ME
A RIDE HOME?

11:30.267 --> 11:32.467
***

11:32.500 --> 11:36.067
DR. BAILEY--
THEN GET OUT.

11:36.067 --> 11:39.133
***

11:43.800 --> 11:46.800
***

11:52.267 --> 11:54.667
(Mindy)
IS--IS THERE ANY NEWS?

11:54.700 --> 11:57.067
WHAT?

11:57.067 --> 11:58.367
OH, I'M SORRY,
MRS. CARLSON.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.267
M-MY HUSBAND...

12:00.300 --> 12:02.633
I WAS WONDERING
IF THERE WAS ANY NEWS

12:02.667 --> 12:04.733
BECAUSE YOU LOOK
SO WORRIED.

12:04.767 --> 12:07.833
AND I HEARD THIS DOCTOR
SAYING THAT EVEN THOUGH

12:07.867 --> 12:10.733
THAT GIRL'S GOT HER FINGER
ON THE TEAR IN HIS HEART,

12:10.767 --> 12:13.667
THAT MY HUSBAND'S
LOSING... BLOOD.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.633
EVERY SECOND,
HE'S LOSING BLOOD,

12:16.667 --> 12:19.100
WHICH MEANS HE COULD DIE.

12:19.133 --> 12:21.133
HE COULD DIE.

12:21.167 --> 12:24.333
I ASK BECAUSE I KNOW
YOU'LL TELL ME THE TRUTH...

12:24.367 --> 12:25.800
BECAUSE YOU LOOK SO WORRIED.

12:25.833 --> 12:28.367
MRS. CARLSON...

12:31.867 --> 12:34.733
YES... IT'S POSSIBLE
HE COULD BLEED OUT AND DIE

12:34.767 --> 12:36.833
IF WE DON'T OPERATE SOON.

12:36.867 --> 12:39.733
OKAY.

12:43.067 --> 12:44.500
OKAY.

12:44.533 --> 12:46.400
THANK YOU

12:46.433 --> 12:48.367
FOR TELLING ME THE TRUTH.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.733
I'LL JUST, UM...

12:50.767 --> 12:52.133
(sobs)

12:52.167 --> 12:55.133
I'LL JUST GO WAIT
OVER HERE. (cries)

12:55.167 --> 12:56.800
LOOK, WILL SOMEBODY
GET ME AN UPDATE?

12:56.833 --> 12:59.700
AND WHERE'S THE HEAD
OF THE BOMB SQUAD?

12:59.733 --> 13:01.733
I'M RIGHT HERE,
AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

13:01.767 --> 13:04.400
MY TEAM'S IN PLACE.
DR. BURKE IS READY.

13:04.433 --> 13:05.567
THE PATIENT'S
IN STABLE CONDITION.

13:05.600 --> 13:09.067
WE CAN HAVE THE BOMB OUT
IN UNDER TEN MINUTES

13:09.100 --> 13:10.400
IF I'M NOT
INTERRUPTED AGAIN.

13:10.433 --> 13:11.800
IN THE O.R.,

13:11.833 --> 13:14.100
WE PUT OUR PATIENTS
UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA.

13:14.133 --> 13:15.300
YEAH?

13:15.333 --> 13:19.067
THAT INVOLVES A STEADY FLOW
OF PURE OXYGEN.

13:19.067 --> 13:21.767
WELL, CAN'T YOU TURN OFF
THE OXYGEN IN MY O.R.?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.467
I CAN AND I HAVE.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.700
BUT...

13:24.733 --> 13:26.800
THIS IS YOUR O.R.

13:26.833 --> 13:32.400
THIS IS THE O.R. FLOOR'S
MAIN OXYGEN LINE.

13:40.267 --> 13:43.500
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

13:43.533 --> 13:44.833
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.733
IT'S JUST WHAT YOU SAY.

13:46.767 --> 13:49.367
I KNOW.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.133
WHERE YOU GOING?

13:53.167 --> 13:54.467
I CAN'T JUST...

13:54.500 --> 13:56.400
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING
TO HELP.

13:56.433 --> 13:58.333
THANK YOU

13:58.367 --> 14:00.833
FOR SAYING THAT
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,

14:00.867 --> 14:03.067
EVEN IF IT IS
JUST WHAT YOU SAY.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.567
(indistinct whispering)

14:14.267 --> 14:16.367
(whispers indistinctly)

14:16.400 --> 14:19.267
STOP IT.

14:19.300 --> 14:20.233
I'M NOT A PATIENT.

14:20.267 --> 14:22.767
WHAT?
THE TWO OF YOU
ARE LOOKING AT ME

14:22.800 --> 14:24.700
THE WAY WE LOOK AT PATIENTS,

14:24.733 --> 14:26.633
LIKE I'M GONNA FREAK OUT
AT ANY MINUTE.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.133
I'M NOT GONNA FREAK OUT.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.700
SO WHATEVER IT IS,
JUST TELL ME STRAIGHT OUT.

14:35.067 --> 14:38.533
THE MAIN OXYGEN LINE RUNS
DIRECTLY UNDER THIS ROOM.

14:38.567 --> 14:39.633
OKAY.

14:41.567 --> 14:43.467
NOT OKAY?

14:43.500 --> 14:46.067
WELL?

14:46.067 --> 14:47.300
I NEED ONE OF YOU

14:47.333 --> 14:49.767
TO TELL ME
WHAT THIS MEANS, EXACTLY.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.200
BECAUSE I THINK I KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS,

14:52.233 --> 14:55.233
BUT I TEND TO BE
"GLASS HALF-EMPTY" THESE DAYS.

14:55.267 --> 14:57.500
SO I WON'T TRUST
WHAT I THINK IT MEANS

14:57.533 --> 15:00.400
BECAUSE WHAT I THINK IT MEANS
IS THAT IF THE BOMB

15:00.433 --> 15:02.333
WERE TO EXPLODE
OVER THE OXYGEN LINE,

15:02.367 --> 15:04.667
THE WHOLE HOSPITAL
COULD BLOW UP.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.300
AND THAT'S JUST CRAZY, RIGHT?

15:10.567 --> 15:12.233
I NEED AN ANSWER

15:12.267 --> 15:14.733
ON WHEN
THEY'RE GONNA START MOVING.
(Izzie) CHIEF.

15:14.767 --> 15:16.200
LOOK, I'M BUSY.

15:16.233 --> 15:18.133
I KNOW, I KNOW YOU'RE
REALLY, REALLY BUSY,

15:18.167 --> 15:20.067
BUT IF THERE WAS SOMETHING,
ANYTHING THAT WE

15:20.100 --> 15:21.833
COULD DO TO HELP,
IT WOULD REALLY BE VERY HELPFUL.

15:21.867 --> 15:23.400
WE NEED AN ASSIGNMENT, SIR.

15:23.433 --> 15:24.667
LOOK, I NEED...

15:24.700 --> 15:25.533
CHIEF?

15:25.567 --> 15:26.800
I NEED...
HE'S PALE AND DIAPHORETIC.

15:26.833 --> 15:29.267
(Alex) CHECK HIS PULSE.
WE NEED TO GET HIM
ON A MONITOR.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.200
WE NEED SOME HELP
OVER HERE.
COME ON, MOVE PEOPLE.

15:31.233 --> 15:32.400
I'LL GET A WHEELCHAIR.

15:32.433 --> 15:35.067
I THINK HE'S HAVING
A HEART ATTACK.

15:37.367 --> 15:39.333
MEREDITH, ALL IT MEANS

15:39.367 --> 15:44.067
IS THAT WE HAVE TO MOVE.

15:44.100 --> 15:44.800
MOVE?

15:44.833 --> 15:46.133
THAT'S RIGHT,
WE HAVE TO MOVE.

15:46.167 --> 15:47.533
(whispers) AND NOW,

15:47.567 --> 15:49.300
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SPEND
ANOTHER SECOND IN THIS ROOM.
WAIT.

15:49.333 --> 15:52.600
I CAN'T WIGGLE MY FINGERS
BECAUSE WE CAN'T SHIFT THE AMMO.

15:52.633 --> 15:54.233
AND NOW YOU WANT TO ROLL OUT
THE ENTIRE GURNEY?

15:54.267 --> 15:57.767
WELL, THAT'S OUR SAFEST--
SAFEST OPTION.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.767
SO WE MOVE.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.700
NOT A PROBLEM.
WE CAN DO THIS.

16:01.733 --> 16:04.200
YOU HANDLING THIS, GREY?

16:04.233 --> 16:06.133
I'M HANDLING THIS.

16:06.167 --> 16:07.633
SO HOW'S IT LOOK?

16:07.667 --> 16:10.100
HARD TO SAY FOR SURE.
E.K.G. IS NORMAL.

16:10.133 --> 16:12.067
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

16:12.067 --> 16:13.467
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GETTING UP.
SIR, YOU SHOULD REALLY WAIT

16:13.500 --> 16:15.300
UNTIL WE GET
THE BLOOD WORK BACK.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.800
I'M NOT LISTENING, STEVENS.
YOU CAN TALK TO ME,
DR. STEVENS.

16:17.833 --> 16:19.633
(Izzie) UM...

16:21.067 --> 16:23.133
UM...

16:23.167 --> 16:24.800
OKAY.

16:24.833 --> 16:27.300
YOUR HUSBAND SHOULD REALLY WAIT
UNTIL WE GET

16:27.333 --> 16:29.367
THE BLOOD WORK BACK
FOR CONFIRMATION.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.500
OKAY, OUT, BOTH OF YOU.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.067
I'M GETTIN' UP.

16:33.067 --> 16:35.400
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
BODYCHECK ME TO DO SO.

16:35.433 --> 16:38.133
ADELE, THERE IS A BOMB.

16:38.167 --> 16:39.433
I HEARD.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.067
DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD...

16:54.567 --> 16:56.133
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

16:56.167 --> 16:57.833
I MEAN, ABOUT DR. BAILEY.

16:57.867 --> 16:59.533
CAN--CAN WE DRUG HER?

16:59.567 --> 17:01.833
AGAINST HER WILL?

17:01.867 --> 17:03.533
NO. WELL... YES?

17:05.200 --> 17:07.667
I MEAN, CAN'T WE FORCE HER
TO PUSH?

17:07.700 --> 17:09.200
IF, UH...

17:09.233 --> 17:11.067
DECLARE HER
TEMPORARILY INSANE?

17:11.067 --> 17:11.900
(sighs)

17:11.933 --> 17:14.733
YOU WANT ME TO DECLARE
MIRANDA BAILEY--

17:14.767 --> 17:18.067
MIRANDA BAILEY-- INCOMPETENT?

17:19.267 --> 17:20.600
DO YOU THINK THAT'LL HELP?

17:20.633 --> 17:23.067
YOU THINK IT'LL MAKE HER
MORE INCLINED,

17:23.100 --> 17:25.467
MORE COMFORTABLE
GIVING BIRTH?
I DON'T KNOW, THAT'S WHY
I'M ASKING YOU.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.700
DO YOU THINK I'M NOT DOING
EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP HER?

17:27.733 --> 17:29.367
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
I'M JUST OUT HERE

17:29.400 --> 17:31.500
BECAUSE, I DON'T KNOW,
I'M FEELIN' A LITTLE LAZY,

17:31.533 --> 17:33.067
JUST NEEDED
A LITTLE "ME" TIME?
I'M JUST ASKING--

17:33.100 --> 17:34.300
STOP ASKING!

17:34.333 --> 17:37.100
BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT YOU ASK,
THE ANSWER IS I DON'T KNOW.

17:37.133 --> 17:38.767
I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN--

17:38.800 --> 17:40.767
EVERYTHING I CAN.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.700
MIRANDA BAILEY'S HUSBAND
IS IN MORTAL DANGER--

17:42.733 --> 17:44.667
ACTUAL MORTAL DANGER--
AND THERE IS NOT A LOT

17:44.700 --> 17:46.600
I CAN SAY
TO COMFORT HER RIGHT NOW

17:46.633 --> 17:49.500
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT
ANYBODY CAN SAY TO COMFORT ME.

17:49.533 --> 17:52.367
I'M DOING MY BEST.
DR. BAILEY IS DOING HER BEST.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.300
AND I NEED YOU
TO DO YOUR BEST,

17:54.333 --> 17:56.233
AND I NEED IT TO BE BETTER
THAN STANDING HERE

17:56.267 --> 17:59.100
ASKING ME THE WORLD'S
STUPIDEST QUESTIONS.

17:59.133 --> 18:02.067
I DON'T KNOW, O'MALLEY!

18:21.867 --> 18:25.433
(faint crying)

18:29.233 --> 18:31.600
HEY.

18:31.633 --> 18:34.467
YOU OKAY?

18:37.233 --> 18:39.367
WAIT, ARE YOU BLEEDING?

18:39.400 --> 18:41.567
I-I THINK I FELL.

18:41.600 --> 18:45.567
I WAS--I WAS RUNNING,
AND, UM, AND I FELL.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.667
IT'S OKAY.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.467
ARE YOU HANNAH?

18:52.500 --> 18:55.500
YEAH.

18:55.533 --> 18:59.133
***

18:59.167 --> 19:02.267
CAN I HAVE THOSE SCISSORS,
DR. YANG?

19:02.300 --> 19:05.167
WHAT IS SO INTERESTING
OUT THERE, DR. YANG?

19:05.200 --> 19:07.533
I-I...

19:07.567 --> 19:11.067
***

19:21.267 --> 19:25.200
***

19:25.233 --> 19:27.133
(Dylan whispers)
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.067
(lowered voice)
LET'S GO OVER IT AGAIN.

19:29.100 --> 19:32.467
THE DEVICE IS SHAPED
LIKE A ROCKET.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.833
IT'S ABOUT 8 INCHES LONG.

19:33.867 --> 19:36.100
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE
EVERYTHING READY.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.567
DR. BURKE'S TEAM
IS GONNA BE IN PLACE

19:38.600 --> 19:40.500
AND MY TEAM
IS GONNA BE IN PLACE.

19:40.533 --> 19:42.433
THEN I'M GONNA ASK YOU
TO TAKE THE HAND

19:42.467 --> 19:46.233
THAT YOU HAVE IN MR. CARLSON
AND WRAP IT AROUND THE DEVICE.

19:46.267 --> 19:47.567
AND PULL IT OUT.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.133
(normal voice) LEVEL.

19:49.167 --> 19:51.333
PULL IT OUT
WHILE KEEPING IT LEVEL.

19:51.367 --> 19:54.367
***

19:56.233 --> 19:58.133
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
LIKE YOU VERY MUCH.

19:58.167 --> 19:59.667
I DON'T LIKE YOU EITHER.

19:59.700 --> 20:00.833
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.267
STOP.
STOP RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:04.633 --> 20:06.533
I THOUGHT DR. BURKE
TOLD YOU TO LEAVE.

20:06.567 --> 20:09.433
WE'RE MOVING TO AN O.R. FURTHER
AWAY FROM THE OXYGEN LINE.

20:09.467 --> 20:11.300
YOU KNOW,
IN CASE WE BLOW UP.

20:11.333 --> 20:13.233
I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER HIM
TELLING YOU TO LEAVE.

20:13.267 --> 20:14.733
WHERE IS HE?

20:14.767 --> 20:16.367
HE'S PREPPING THE O.R.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.233
THEN HE'LL NEVER KNOW,
WILL HE?

20:25.433 --> 20:27.033
YOU STAY OVER THERE.

20:28.833 --> 20:32.133
YOU STAY OVER THERE.

20:32.167 --> 20:33.533
***

20:33.567 --> 20:35.300
YOU READY?

20:39.700 --> 20:41.367
NICE.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.767
TELL ME SOMETHING.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.133
WHAT?

20:44.167 --> 20:45.533
CRISTINA...

20:45.567 --> 20:48.767
I HAVE MY HAND ON A BOMB,
I'M FREAKIN' OUT,

20:48.800 --> 20:51.633
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
I REALLY HAVE TO PEE.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.200
TELL ME ANYTHING.

20:53.233 --> 20:55.667
***

20:55.700 --> 20:57.600
HE TOLD ME HE LOVED ME.

20:57.633 --> 20:59.400
LAST NIGHT--
HE THOUGHT I WAS SLEEPING,

20:59.433 --> 21:01.400
BUT I HEARD HIM SAY IT.

21:01.433 --> 21:02.767
BURKE LOVES YOU.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.367
YEAH.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.067
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.733
BURKE LOVES YOU.

21:09.767 --> 21:11.767
YEAH, EVERYBODY HAS PROBLEMS.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.600
WELL, ARE YOU GONNA
SAY IT BACK OR...

21:15.633 --> 21:17.200
OF COURSE NOT.

21:17.233 --> 21:19.500
HE DIDN'T SAY IT TO ME.
HE SAID IT TO SLEEPING ME.

21:19.533 --> 21:22.167
RECIPROCITY IS NOT REQUIRED.

21:24.233 --> 21:25.400
BESIDES, HE MIGHT BLOW UP.

21:25.433 --> 21:27.633
EXCELLENT POINT.

21:27.667 --> 21:29.433
***

21:37.333 --> 21:38.800
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.

21:38.833 --> 21:43.700
LET'S JUST KEEP PLACING
ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER.

21:43.733 --> 21:46.067
NICE AND SLOW.

21:46.067 --> 21:48.433
ALL RIGHT, MEREDITH,
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
OKAY.

21:48.467 --> 21:50.367
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
NICE AND EASY. YOU READY?

21:50.400 --> 21:51.433
YEP.

21:51.467 --> 21:53.300
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.700
ALL RIGHT, NICE AND SLOW.

21:58.733 --> 22:01.667
***

22:01.700 --> 22:03.767
YOU HAD TO SAY
YOU WERE GONNA DIE TODAY.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.700
I TOLD YOU.

22:06.733 --> 22:10.633
***

22:14.500 --> 22:16.067
IT'S NOT TOO DEEP,

22:16.067 --> 22:19.300
BUT YOU ARE GONNA NEED
A COUPLE OF STITCHES.

22:20.333 --> 22:21.667
HANNAH...

22:21.700 --> 22:24.067
UH, IS THERE SOMEONE
YOU'D LIKE ME TO CALL?

22:24.100 --> 22:25.267
FAMILY OR MAYBE...

22:25.300 --> 22:27.133
OKAY.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.733
THAT DOCTOR...

22:31.767 --> 22:33.300
DR. GREY.

22:33.333 --> 22:35.433
MEREDITH.

22:35.467 --> 22:36.600

22:36.633 --> 22:38.500
SHE'S STILL THERE.

22:38.533 --> 22:40.533
SO SHE'S STILL ALIVE?

22:40.567 --> 22:42.367
SHE'S ALIVE.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.267
SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

22:44.300 --> 22:48.133

22:49.300 --> 22:52.500
DR. MILTON
SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT YOU.

22:52.533 --> 22:53.700
HE'S A COWARD.

22:53.733 --> 22:55.067
I'M THE COWARD.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.567
NO.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.200
I RAN AWAY.

22:59.233 --> 23:01.133
YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

23:01.167 --> 23:04.067
YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE
THE KIND OF PERSON WHO STAYS

23:04.067 --> 23:07.400
AND DOES SOMETHING.

23:07.433 --> 23:09.367
YOU KNOW, A GOOD MAN
IN A STORM.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.300
I'M A PARAMEDIC.

23:11.333 --> 23:13.200
I'M SUPPOSED TO STAY
AND DO SOMETHING.

23:13.233 --> 23:15.833
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO RUN AWAY.

23:15.867 --> 23:18.433
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO HIDE
UNDER THE STAIRS

23:18.467 --> 23:21.767
'CAUSE I LEFT TWO PEOPLE
TO DIE.

23:21.800 --> 23:25.467
I WAS SUPPOSED TO STAY
AND DO SOMETHING.

23:25.500 --> 23:28.533
I RAN AWAY.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.067
WELL, BLOOD WORK'S BACK.

23:35.100 --> 23:37.100
THE CHIEF HAD
AN ANXIETY ATTACK.

23:37.133 --> 23:38.500
(sighs)

23:38.533 --> 23:39.833
WHO'S GONNA TELL HIM?

23:39.867 --> 23:41.767
UM... I GAVE YOU SEX
IN A LINEN CLOSET,

23:41.800 --> 23:42.767
YOU TELL HIM.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.433
FAIR ENOUGH.

23:47.667 --> 23:49.567
OKAY, DR. BAILEY,
LET'S GO.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.133
(cries)

23:52.167 --> 23:54.400
DR. BAILEY, I NEED YOU
TO TURN ON YOUR BACK.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.233
I NEED YOU TO PUSH.

23:56.267 --> 23:57.333
LEAVE ME ALONE.

23:57.367 --> 23:58.400

MIRANDA...

24:00.867 --> 24:03.833
ALL RIGHT, I CAN'T LET HER GO
ANY LONGER.

24:03.867 --> 24:05.367
I'M GONNA GO TELL RICHARD

24:05.400 --> 24:07.300
THAT HE HAS TO GIVE US
AN O.R., OKAY?

24:07.333 --> 24:09.233
DR. BAILEY,
I'M SURPRISED AT YOU.

24:09.267 --> 24:10.600
I REALLY THOUGHT--

24:10.633 --> 24:13.267
THIS IS NOT HOW I THOUGHT
YOU WOULD DO THIS.

24:13.300 --> 24:15.200
DR. O'MALLEY,
I DON'T THINK THAT--

24:15.233 --> 24:18.167
I TRULY--
I EXPECTED MORE

24:18.200 --> 24:19.533
GEORGE...

24:30.533 --> 24:31.700
YOU'RE DR. BAILEY.

24:31.733 --> 24:33.400

24:33.433 --> 24:36.233
YOU DON'T HIDE FROM A FIGHT.

24:36.267 --> 24:39.433
YOU DON'T GIVE UP.

24:39.467 --> 24:42.333
YOU STRIVE FOR GREATNESS.

24:42.367 --> 24:49.167
YOU, DR. BAILEY...
YOU ARE A DOER.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.800
I KNOW YOUR HUSBAND'S
NOT HERE,

24:52.833 --> 24:55.767
AND I KNOW THERE ARE
A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON HERE

24:55.800 --> 24:59.567
THAT WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.367
BUT THIS...

25:06.300 --> 25:08.767

26:05.067 --> 26:08.400
WHEN I CUT, THE BLEEDING'S
GOING TO INTENSIFY.

26:08.433 --> 26:10.333
IF WE'RE GOING TO SAVE
MR. CARLSON,

26:10.367 --> 26:12.533
YOU HAVE TO PULL
THE AMMO OUT IMMEDIATELY.
BUT REMEMBER,

26:12.567 --> 26:15.533
REMOVE IT WHILE KEEPING IT
AS LEVEL AS POSSIBLE.

26:15.567 --> 26:17.467

WHICH IS PATHETIC, BUT...

38:36.800 --> 38:40.667
THE LAST TIME WE WERE
TOGETHER AND HAPPY, I...

38:40.700 --> 38:43.333
WANT TO BE ABLE
TO REMEMBER THAT,

38:43.367 --> 38:46.600
AND I CAN'T, DEREK.

38:48.067 --> 38:50.500
I CAN'T REMEMBER IT.

38:55.233 --> 38:57.700
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T DIE TODAY.

39:04.667 --> 39:07.733
IT WAS A THURSDAY MORNING.

39:12.167 --> 39:14.233
YOU WERE WEARING THAT RATTY
LITTLE DARTMOUTH T-SHIRT

39:14.267 --> 39:16.300
YOU LOOK SO GOOD IN.

39:16.333 --> 39:19.200
THE ONE WITH THE HOLE
IN THE BACK OF THE NECK.

39:20.767 --> 39:22.100
YOU JUST WASHED YOUR HAIR,

39:22.133 --> 39:26.600
AND YOU SMELLED LIKE
SOME KIND OF... FLOWER.

39:26.633 --> 39:29.633
***

39:29.667 --> 39:32.633
I WAS RUNNING LATE
FOR SURGERY.

39:32.667 --> 39:35.433
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA
SEE ME LATER.

39:35.467 --> 39:37.800
THEN YOU LEANED INTO ME,

39:37.833 --> 39:40.800
YOU PUT YOUR HAND
ON MY CHEST...

39:40.833 --> 39:43.167
AND THEN YOU KISSED ME.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.800
SOFT...

39:44.833 --> 39:48.567
IT WAS QUICK,
KINDA LIKE A HABIT.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.800
YOU KNOW, LIKE WE'D DO IT
EVERY DAY

39:50.833 --> 39:53.400
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

39:53.433 --> 39:55.333
***

39:55.367 --> 39:57.267
YOU WENT BACK TO READING
YOUR NEWSPAPER,

39:57.300 --> 39:58.700
AND I WENT TO WORK.

40:00.333 --> 40:02.433
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
WE KISSED.

40:02.467 --> 40:04.367
***

40:04.400 --> 40:06.433
LAVENDER.

40:09.667 --> 40:14.700
MY HAIR SMELLED LIKE LAVENDER
FROM MY CONDITIONER.

40:14.733 --> 40:16.633
***

40:16.667 --> 40:18.500
LAVENDER.

40:18.533 --> 40:21.733
***

40:30.467 --> 40:34.167
IF YOU KNEW THIS WAS
YOUR LAST DAY ON EARTH,

40:34.200 --> 40:37.067
HOW WOULD YOU
WANT TO SPEND IT?

40:37.100 --> 40:40.100
***
