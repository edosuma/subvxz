00:05.233 --> 00:09.200
OH, HI, GUYS.
HOW WAS THE FIRST DAY
OF THE NEW SEMESTER?

00:09.200 --> 00:13.000
WOOD SHOP IS GOING GREAT.
MR. WOODBURN LOVES ME.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.667
HE'S LETTING ME
WORK WITH MAHOGANY.
[CLICKS TONGUE]

00:16.667 --> 00:20.200
EXCUSE ME, DID YOU JUST SAY
A TEACHER LOVES YOU?

00:20.200 --> 00:23.834
YEAH, I KNOW. THREW ME
FOR A LOOP, TOO.

00:23.834 --> 00:26.900
CODY, HOW WAS
YOUR NEW MATH CLASS?

00:26.900 --> 00:29.233
YOU MEAN ADVANCED CALCULUS,
COVERING FUNCTIONS, LIMITS,

00:29.233 --> 00:32.700
CONVERGENTS, SEQUENCES,
AND MULTIVARIABLES?

00:32.700 --> 00:34.967
YEAH, THAT ONE.

00:34.967 --> 00:39.133
THEY CANCELED IT. I WAS
THE ONLY ONE WHO SHOWED UP.

00:39.133 --> 00:43.934
I HEARD ABOUT THAT.
EVEN THE TEACHER
DIDN'T SHOW UP.

00:43.934 --> 00:48.000
CODY, YOU MIGHT WANNA TAKE
A LITTLE LESS-CHALLENGING
COURSE FOR YOUR ELECTIVE.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.300
HAVE SOME FUN.

00:49.300 --> 00:53.600
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE
AN EASY CLASS, LIKE WOOD SHOP?

00:53.600 --> 00:56.600
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WOOD SHOP IS EASY?

00:56.600 --> 01:00.133
HELLO. YOU'RE TAKING IT.

01:00.133 --> 01:03.734
COME ON, HOW HARD CAN IT BE
TO MAKE A STUPID BOX?

01:03.734 --> 01:08.200
IT'S NOT A STUPID BOX.
IT'S GOT AUTOMATIC DRAWERS.

THERE. I'M DOING
MY SHORT STORY
FOR ENGLISH CLASS.

02:07.033 --> 02:10.000
WANNA HEAR IT?
NO. I'M PLAYING SOLITAIRE.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.567
OK. IT'S ABOUT
A STARVING SLOVAK PEASANT
IN THE 15TH CENTURY.

02:15.567 --> 02:18.300
"SVETLANA WATCHED

THAT'S FANTASTIC.
YOU REALLY LIKED IT?

02:28.300 --> 02:30.967
NO, I WON, AND THE LITTLE CARDS
ARE DANCING.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.100
WELL, LET'S HEAR
SOME OF YOUR STORY.

02:35.100 --> 02:38.700
OK, IT'S ABOUT IVANA.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.834
"I AM A DOG
WHO LIVES IN A HOTEL."

02:44.567 --> 02:45.600
YES?

02:45.600 --> 02:48.233
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL YOU WROTE?

02:48.233 --> 02:51.734
HELLO. SHORT STORY. DUH.

02:51.734 --> 02:56.400
BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL US
HER NAME OR WHO YOU ARE
OR WHAT YOU DO TOGETHER.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.567
AND YOU ALSO
MISSPELLED "DOG."

02:58.567 --> 03:02.900
I'M SUNK. THIS ASSIGNMENT'S
DUE TOMORROW,

03:02.900 --> 03:04.800
AND IT TOOK ME FOREVER
TO WRITE THAT SENTENCE.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.600
THAT'S A SHAME, BECAUSE
A LITTLE DOG LIVING IN A HOTEL
IS A GOOD IDEA.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.767
THAT'S THE ONLY KIND I HAVE.

03:10.767 --> 03:15.133
IN FACT, IT CAN MAKE
A GREAT CHILDREN'S STORY.

03:15.133 --> 03:18.500
MY NAME IS IVANA,
I LIVE AT THE TIPTON,

03:18.500 --> 03:20.800
IT'S
A VERY SPECIAL HOTEL...

03:28.734 --> 03:32.500
OH, WHAT A GREAT STORY. HOW CAN
YOU MAKE IT UP ON THE SPOT?

03:32.500 --> 03:36.200
IS THERE A NAME FOR THAT?
INTELLIGENCE?

03:39.600 --> 03:43.934
AND THAT'S HOW
THE SCREWDRIVER
GOT ITS NAME.

03:43.934 --> 03:47.700
WHEN YOU NEED TO DRIVE
A SCREW, YOU USE A...

03:47.700 --> 03:51.200
SCREWDRIVER.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.300
COULD THIS CLASS
BE ANY EASIER?

03:54.300 --> 03:57.667
SHH, I'M TRYING
TO TAKE NOTES.

03:57.667 --> 03:59.400
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE NOTES.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.600
IT'S JUST WOOD SHOP.

04:01.600 --> 04:05.200
YOU THINK WOOD SHOP
IS EASY, IS THAT IT, SON?

04:05.200 --> 04:06.400

04:46.500 --> 04:50.600
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
BACK TO YOUR PROJECTS,
AND REMEMBER--

04:50.600 --> 04:54.500
NEVER CHISEL
TOWARDS YOURSELF.

04:54.500 --> 04:58.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:58.000 --> 05:00.133
GETTING READY
TO DRILL A HOLE.

05:00.133 --> 05:05.100
HERE IN WOOD SHOP,
WE TUCK IN OUR SHIRTS
BEFORE WE USE TOOLS.

05:05.934 --> 05:08.834
BUT THIS SHIRT
IS 100% LINEN.

05:08.834 --> 05:11.867
IF I TUCK IT IN,
THEN TAKE IT OUT,
IT'LL BE WRINKLED.

05:11.867 --> 05:14.600
THERE'S A 100% CHANCE
YOU'LL BE WRINKLED

05:14.600 --> 05:17.100
WHEN YOU GET
SUCKED INTO A SANDER.

05:17.100 --> 05:22.000
THESE SAFETY RULES WERE MADE
FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.500
OH, YEAH? AND WHO
CAME UP WITH THEM?

05:25.500 --> 05:27.500
9-FINGER NICK.

05:28.567 --> 05:30.600
OK, WELL,
FORGET THE DRILL.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.033
I'LL JUST PUT
THE SCREW IN WITHOUT IT.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.000
SEE? THIS ONE'S GOT
A SHARPY, POINTY END.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.600
IF YOU DON'T DRILL A HOLE,
YOU'LL SPLIT THE WOOD.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.033
NO, I WON'T.

05:43.300 --> 05:49.133
OOH...YOU SPLIT THE WOOD.

05:49.133 --> 05:53.200
YOU WASTED A PERFECTLY GOOD
PIECE OF WOOD.

05:53.200 --> 05:56.667
DO YOU THINK WOOD
GROWS ON TREES?

05:56.667 --> 05:59.200
YOU'RE GETTING A DEMERIT,
YOUNG MAN.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.300
HE'S VERY STRICT.

06:01.300 --> 06:05.967
YESTERDAY,
HE MADE ME DO PUSH-UPS
FOR SANDING AGAINST THE GRAIN.

06:05.967 --> 06:09.600
BUT I'VE NEVER GOTTEN
A DEMERIT IN MY LIFE.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.867

A VERY SPECIAL MOMENT.

WHEN IT STARTS TO GET ON
PEOPLE'S NERVES.

06:33.867 --> 06:37.900
THAT WAS 4 HOURS
AND 59 MINUTES AGO.

06:37.900 --> 06:41.100

I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF HE SENT YOU A LAVISH GIFT.

07:36.300 --> 07:39.200
AND IF I KNOW DADDY,
IT'LL BE SOMETHING
THAT STARTS WITH AN "A."

LOVE IT.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.500
ALL RIGHT.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.400
I COULD TELL MOSEBY
WHERE YOUR STORY CAME FROM.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.967
SO YOU HELPED ME A LITTLE.
BIG DEAL.

07:58.967 --> 08:01.300
IT'S THE ONLY "A"
I'VE EVER GOTTEN.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.500
IT'D BE AWFULLY MEAN

WHAT YOU'D CALL "SMART."

08:10.767 --> 08:14.133
OK, I WON'T SAY ANYTHING,

08:14.133 --> 08:16.734

IS ONE YOU GET ON YOUR OWN.

08:16.734 --> 08:18.500

NOT TO TELL?

08:18.500 --> 08:21.300
YES, I PROMISE I WON'T TELL.

08:21.300 --> 08:25.700
OR MAY THE EVIL

BECAUSE HE'S JEALOUS
OF MY PERFECT

08:44.000 --> 08:47.700
DID NOT. HE'S JEALOUS
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING
IN SCHOOL I'M BETTER AT.

SO TRUE.
