(Indistinct chatter)

00:11.145 --> 00:12.578
- Phil?
- Excuse me. Yeah?

00:12.713 --> 00:14.513
- I wanted you to meet
my sister, Evelyn.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.315
The real genius of the family.

00:16.317 --> 00:19.051
She just graduated
with distinction in music

00:19.120 --> 00:20.519
from the University of Ottawa.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.588
Ev, this is Philip Grimmer,
my new partner.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.122
He's about to become
the most powerful lawyer

00:24.191 --> 00:26.191
in Montreal thanks to me.

00:26.326 --> 00:28.394
- Ah, you must be the brains
behind the new firm.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.161
- That makes me the beauty.
- Or the beast.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.564
(Chuckling)

00:32.699 --> 00:33.998
- Drinks?

00:34.035 --> 00:35.734
- Uh, yeah.

00:36.937 --> 00:37.869
(Chuckling)

00:37.938 --> 00:40.539
- My brother has told me
a lot about you...

00:40.674 --> 00:43.942
that you have
a real way with words.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.479
- Right, uh...

00:47.515 --> 00:48.814
Ottawa...

00:49.850 --> 00:52.684
Uh, it's nice
this time of year, yeah?

00:52.720 --> 00:53.619
(Chuckling)

00:53.754 --> 00:54.820
Oh, God. No.

00:56.023 --> 00:56.421
- That's a start.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.490
(Chuckling)

00:58.492 --> 01:01.292
- This is gonna
sound crazy, but...

01:03.697 --> 01:05.230
I feel like
I already know you.

01:05.365 --> 01:09.267
You know, like you're
a part of my life.

01:09.804 --> 01:11.336
That you're...

01:12.973 --> 01:13.972
- What?

01:15.242 --> 01:17.008
- Everything.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.816
-<i> I'm moving to Prague</i>
<i> soon to study.</i>

01:26.086 --> 01:27.385
Don't get attached.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.322

Is that mine?

It's your brother freaking out,

02:34.255 --> 02:35.053
- No, it's mine.

02:36.356 --> 02:37.322
Yeah, hi.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.125
Don't worry, I was awake.

I'd love to have you both here,

We're invited to my parents'

- Ugh, come on.
- It's my mom's birthday.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.344
- Ugh, what is...
- Can you come?

02:57.344 --> 02:57.375
- Ugh, this Wifi

- Ugh, what is...

It's driving me crazy.

03:03.016 --> 03:03.749
What?

03:03.884 --> 03:07.352
- Dinner. My parents. Tomorrow.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.422
- Oh, uh...

03:11.892 --> 03:15.894
your dad's homemade wine could
strip the paint off these walls.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.963
No, you go.
You'll have more fun without me.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.999
- Fine, don't come.
I'm not pushing for it anymore.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.902
- What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:23.971 --> 03:26.438
Can I get that
on the record please?

03:27.441 --> 03:29.041
- Not now.
- Come on.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.577
I need some proof
for when you try and...

03:32.646 --> 03:34.112
(Door closing, saw whirring)

03:34.181 --> 03:35.247
Back in January,

03:35.382 --> 03:37.649
you said this was gonna be
seven or eight weeks.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.118
Here we are,
in the middle of May.

03:40.187 --> 03:41.119
- Your cheque bounced.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.822
- OK, well, I mean,

03:44.858 --> 03:46.525
that's a--
that's a banking issue.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.393
I can fix that.
But come on.

03:48.528 --> 03:51.296
It's still not an excuse
to be this far behind schedule.

03:51.332 --> 03:54.468
- Maybe it's because you
forced me to hire your brother.

03:54.468 --> 03:54.532
Andy, how are
those French doors coming?
- Maybe it's because you
forced me to hire your brother.

03:54.532 --> 03:57.269
Andy, how are
those French doors coming?

03:57.404 --> 03:58.469
No French doors
and no brother.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.538
- OK, OK.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.308
If I can get him to be where
he's supposed to be, uh,

04:03.443 --> 04:04.409
can you rush the job?

04:04.411 --> 04:06.745
(Chuckling)

04:06.880 --> 04:07.746
(Sighing)

04:07.815 --> 04:10.148
What if we hire another guy?

04:10.150 --> 04:11.416
- Yeah. Yeah, that'll work.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.985
(Hammer pounding,
saw whirring)

04:14.120 --> 04:15.620
- OK, great.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.024
- Well, you sure told him.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.825
- Don't rub it in.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.360
- Why do you protect
your brother?

04:22.396 --> 04:23.295
- Look, he hasn't
had it easy, OK?

04:23.430 --> 04:24.496
He's trying.

04:24.565 --> 04:27.165
- He's never gonna
take responsibility

04:27.167 --> 04:29.968
for his actions
if you always bail him out.

04:30.103 --> 04:30.969
I know.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.437
- No, this is nothing
like your brother,

04:32.572 --> 04:34.639
and you know it.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.508
Besides, Andy charges us
less than half

04:36.577 --> 04:37.976
of one of Cedric's guys.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.378
- Yeah, but what's the point
if it takes three times longer?

04:40.414 --> 04:42.914
(Sighing)

04:42.916 --> 04:45.583
Stop trying to fix
everything and everyone.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.852
- I will take care
of the money, OK?

04:47.888 --> 04:49.387
Promise.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.588
We're gonna get
a big injection of cash

04:50.724 --> 04:52.791
after we sign Keas tomorrow.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.259
- Turn left.
We'll avoid the traffic.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.428
- No, I'm going right.

04:56.563 --> 04:57.462
- Phil!
- What? It's quicker this way.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.997
- Yeah...

05:00.134 --> 05:01.133
(Sighing)

05:01.268 --> 05:01.667
- Shit!

05:01.802 --> 05:02.534
(Horns honking)

05:02.536 --> 05:04.670
- I'm taking the subway.

05:04.805 --> 05:05.537
- We're going
to the same place.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.872
- I told you,
I have an errand.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.608
- Ev!
- I'll see you at work.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.010
- I'll deal with Andy.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.845

05:26.560 --> 05:28.059

05:29.630 --> 05:31.630

05:31.632 --> 05:33.498
- Oh God!
- Andy?

05:33.633 --> 05:35.467
- Yeah, what's going on?

05:38.439 --> 05:39.370
- Oh, are you OK?

05:40.040 --> 05:42.106
- What? Yeah, I'm OK.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.642
Uh, you wouldn't believe
what happened last night.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.378
- Right...
- No, the power went out a--

05:47.414 --> 05:48.246
- Were you drinking?

05:49.450 --> 05:51.183
- What? No, come on.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.852
- Andy, I got you a job.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.554
You gotta show up for it.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.923
Every day, starting now.

06:03.330 --> 06:03.862
Take a cab.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.330
(Phone ringing)

06:08.335 --> 06:09.734
Maybe a shower too.

06:09.803 --> 06:12.604
Hello?
- Where the hell are you?

06:12.673 --> 06:14.272
We need to prep!
-<i> Yes.</i>

06:14.408 --> 06:15.440
I'm on my way.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.683

06:28.789 --> 06:30.855

06:50.577 --> 06:51.843
-<i> Sorry I'm late.</i>

06:51.879 --> 06:53.311
Here are all
the briefs concerning

06:53.447 --> 06:55.646
the protected farmland
Keas wants to purchase.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.582
- Oh, yeah. Phil and I
can give it some context.

06:57.717 --> 06:59.818
- Yeah.
- Everything's there.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.586
You just need to merge it
with the rest

07:01.588 --> 07:03.388
of the presentation
and print it out.

07:03.523 --> 07:05.590
- Uh, can you do it?
We kind of lost our intern.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.459
- And you still
have no receptionist.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.328
- Well, after we sign Keas,
it'll be a whole new ball game.

07:10.463 --> 07:11.696
- It better be.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.666
- We'll be expanding,
right, Phil?

07:12.666 --> 07:12.764
- Yes, that's right.
- We'll be expanding,
right, Phil?

07:12.764 --> 07:13.664
- Yes, that's right.

07:13.700 --> 07:14.699
Three more lawyers,

07:14.768 --> 07:17.201
a receptionist
and a paralegal.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.103
Which reminds me,

07:18.238 --> 07:19.871
can you pull together
a candidate list,

07:19.873 --> 07:22.139
set up interviews with
the best and brightest?

07:22.176 --> 07:23.141
- Me?

07:24.244 --> 07:25.477
- Yeah.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.744
Please?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.613
- This was supposed
to be part-time.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.882
I'm up to sixty hours a week.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.017
- I know, I know.
It's temporary, I promise.

07:33.152 --> 07:35.286
(Phone ringing)

07:37.591 --> 07:38.523
- I hope you catch
your big fish.

07:38.658 --> 07:41.426
If not, I'm the next one
out the door.

07:41.428 --> 07:42.494
- Don't you worry,

07:42.496 --> 07:44.696
you'll be very busy
counting our Keas income.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.231
- Grimmer and Landry.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.033
How can I help you?

07:48.168 --> 07:49.968
(Sirens blaring)

07:52.505 --> 07:54.405
- All right,

07:54.441 --> 07:55.040
my part's done.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.508
Are you winning?
- Almost.

07:56.643 --> 08:00.712
I just have to look it over
one last time in the morning.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.314
- Good. Look at us.

08:02.316 --> 08:03.248
It's all happening, man.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.649
Six years ago,
we started with nothing.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.918
- It's about time.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.322
(Chuckling)

08:13.760 --> 08:16.394
(Sighing)

08:52.766 --> 08:54.699
Hold on, Ev.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.434
We're almost there.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.709
(Birds chirping)

09:15.388 --> 09:17.188
(Sighing)

09:17.324 --> 09:20.558
- What colour did we agree on
for the bedroom?

09:20.627 --> 09:21.626
(Sighing)

09:21.761 --> 09:24.528
- Good morning to you too.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.930
- What colour?

09:27.200 --> 09:28.532
(Sighing)

09:28.969 --> 09:30.701
- Blue.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.471
- Unbelievable.

09:33.507 --> 09:36.575
- OK, Ev, why don't you tell me
what colour we wanted

09:36.710 --> 09:37.609
for the bedroom.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.144
- I have told you,
but you never listen.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.813
I'm sick and tired of my opinion
counting for shit.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.748
- Ev, come on.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.949
This is paint.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.752
I don't have the energy
to fight with you over,

09:47.887 --> 09:49.354
like, meaningless details.

09:49.423 --> 09:50.354
- Meaningless details?

09:50.390 --> 09:51.756
Like making me
the firm's secretary?

09:51.891 --> 09:54.828
- Jesus.
We all gotta make sacrifices.

09:54.828 --> 09:54.892
- Yeah, some more than others.
- Jesus.
We all gotta make sacrifices.

09:54.892 --> 09:56.527
- Yeah, some more than others.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.963
- OK, you know what?

09:58.999 --> 10:01.532
I have to focus
on the presentation here.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.241
- Go get them!

10:10.243 --> 10:11.109
(Chuckling)

10:11.244 --> 10:13.111
- You're not coming
into the office?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.647
- You guys will be out all day.
I'll work from home.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.782
- OK. I love you.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.055
(Door closing)

10:26.927 --> 10:29.761
(Horns honking)

10:32.265 --> 10:35.066
Now, we all know to develop
this mine means the involvement

10:35.068 --> 10:36.000
of three levels
of government.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.603
And every law firm
worth its salt has

10:38.605 --> 10:40.604
its contacts in each of them.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.874
But we have
something special.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.210
We know the region
you want to excavate.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.679
We grew up here.
We know the people.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.681
We understand the issues
from the ground up.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.951
And we can handle
all of the inevitable concerns

10:52.953 --> 10:54.686
that locals are gonna have

10:54.821 --> 10:56.588
about a project
of this magnitude.

10:56.590 --> 10:59.758
So yes, we'll have influence
with the municipal counsel,

10:59.760 --> 11:01.159
but more importantly,

11:01.161 --> 11:03.360
with the very residents
who are gonna vote

11:03.397 --> 11:05.863
on whether or not
your project gets green lit.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.734
And that...

11:07.734 --> 11:07.765
well, I mean,
that's priceless.
And that...

11:07.765 --> 11:10.168
well, I mean,
that's priceless.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.239
<i> Ev!</i>

11:15.375 --> 11:16.174
(Door closing)

11:16.243 --> 11:17.042

11:24.117 --> 11:25.984
Hey, what's going on?

11:25.986 --> 11:28.186
- I didn't want to spoil
your presentation.

11:30.691 --> 11:31.522
- What are you doing?

11:31.558 --> 11:34.592
- I can't do
this anymore, Phil.

11:34.727 --> 11:35.927
- Are you leaving me?

11:36.062 --> 11:39.497
- I need some space to think,
to clear my head.

11:39.533 --> 11:40.664
- Whoa, whoa, Evelyn.

11:40.701 --> 11:41.800
OK, hey, hey, hey.

11:41.802 --> 11:42.534
Ev, slow down.

11:42.669 --> 11:45.236
Hey, we--we hit
a rough patch

11:45.305 --> 11:45.836
with the firm and the house,

11:45.872 --> 11:47.739
but it's over, OK?

11:47.874 --> 11:49.807
We--we did it.
We got through it.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.943
We--we can finally have
the life that we wanted.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.878
We can start a family.
- N-not like this.

11:54.013 --> 11:54.913
- What?
What are you talking about?

11:54.915 --> 11:57.515
- Phil, you have no idea
how I've felt

11:57.517 --> 11:58.416
for the past 6 months.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.517
- Then tell me, how?

11:59.553 --> 12:01.619
- I'm not sure this
is the life that I want.

12:01.688 --> 12:04.556
- Well then, what is the life
that you want, Ev?

12:04.691 --> 12:05.823
You gotta tell me.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.691
- You have no idea?

12:08.895 --> 12:09.961
You have no clue?

12:10.030 --> 12:12.030
- I...

12:12.032 --> 12:14.365
- Why am I not surprised?

12:15.969 --> 12:17.402
- Come on, Evelyn.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.970
Evelyn, stop. Hey!

12:19.039 --> 12:19.871

22:00.086 --> 22:01.619
you're lucky I'm here
to keep an eye

22:01.754 --> 22:02.819
on these lazy clowns,

22:02.855 --> 22:05.689
make sure that
they don't butcher the house.

22:05.725 --> 22:06.557
- Oh.

22:06.559 --> 22:07.691
-<i> In sports news,</i>

22:07.694 --> 22:10.094
<i> a humiliating 5-0 defeat</i>
<i> for the Habs shook</i>

22:10.096 --> 22:10.961
<i> Montreal fans yesterday.</i>

22:10.963 --> 22:12.563
- Yeah?
-<i> Where are you, man?</i>

22:12.632 --> 22:13.697
<i> Everyone's waiting.</i>

22:13.700 --> 22:15.199
I got a follow-up with Keas.

22:15.268 --> 22:16.400
-<i> Yeah, OK.</i>

22:16.402 --> 22:18.102
Can you take it down
a notch, please?

22:18.237 --> 22:19.170
My head's about to explode.

22:19.305 --> 22:21.639
-<i> Get your ass here.</i>
- I'll be right there.

22:21.774 --> 22:24.108
(Hammer pounding,
doorbell ringing)

22:27.613 --> 22:30.714
- Philip Grimmer?
- Yeah?

22:32.885 --> 22:35.519
Hey! Hey!
Let go of me.

22:35.654 --> 22:38.322
Let go of me! Stop!

22:38.457 --> 22:40.291
Hey! Ugh!

22:40.293 --> 22:42.125
(Tires squealing)

22:47.600 --> 22:49.800
(Alarm beeping)

23:01.614 --> 23:03.613
- Are you OK?

23:04.550 --> 23:05.683
- What's the date?

23:05.685 --> 23:08.219
- The 18th.

23:08.354 --> 23:09.619
(Gasping)

23:11.124 --> 23:12.422
- Oh my God!

23:12.558 --> 23:14.625
(Phone buzzing)

23:15.661 --> 23:17.828
- Yeah, hi.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.897
Don't worry, I was awake.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.901
Um, I'd love
to have you both here,

23:24.036 --> 23:24.835
but you know.

23:25.838 --> 23:27.304
Sure, that works, Dad.

23:27.340 --> 23:28.839
Yeah, bye.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.610
We're invited to--
- It's your mom's birthday.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.246
- You remembered?

23:36.381 --> 23:37.981
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

23:38.017 --> 23:38.716
And...

23:38.718 --> 23:41.185
and she's having a dinner.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.621
And, uh, and, uh,
and I think we should go.

23:43.623 --> 23:44.722
- Are you messing with me?

23:44.724 --> 23:47.992
You never want to go
to my parents'.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.026
- Yeah, but, uh,
I want to go now.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.464
- What's going on?

23:53.466 --> 23:54.798
- Nothing.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.600
No--nothing, nothing.
I just...

23:56.669 --> 23:58.335
I--I want to go.
I'm excited.

23:59.672 --> 24:02.172
- OK...

24:12.685 --> 24:14.084
- First thing's first,

24:14.086 --> 24:15.652
don't deposit that cheque
I gave you.

24:15.688 --> 24:18.322
We're gonna pay you
cash from now on.

24:18.391 --> 24:19.322
Here you go.
- Thank you.

24:19.358 --> 24:20.557
- Second, we need
this done in 2 weeks.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.693
- That's impossible.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.628
- We've been living
in a warzone for months.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.162
That stops now.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.232
- One condition--

24:28.367 --> 24:30.367
- That we hire a new guy
to replace my brother

24:30.403 --> 24:32.769
who I shouldn't have insisted
you hire in the first place.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.204
I agree. He's unreliable.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.374
So, I handle that
and we have a deal?

24:37.376 --> 24:37.641
- We got a deal.

24:37.776 --> 24:39.843
- Great.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.645
(Saw whirring,
hammer pounding)

24:41.714 --> 24:42.713
- Well, you sure told him.

24:42.715 --> 24:45.215
- Not bad, right?

24:45.251 --> 24:48.652
- So, when did you decide not
to enable your brother anymore?

24:49.722 --> 24:51.655
- Look, my guilt
about our childhood isn't

24:51.691 --> 24:53.123
gonna help him.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.695
If he doesn't start learning
to do things for himself now,

24:55.695 --> 24:55.726
he never will.
If he doesn't start learning
to do things for himself now,

24:55.726 --> 24:57.461
he never will.

24:57.596 --> 24:58.562
- And the cash you promised?

24:58.698 --> 25:00.197
Where is it gonna come from?

25:00.332 --> 25:01.298
- The Keas contract.

25:02.635 --> 25:03.667
Don't worry. You'll see.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.702
- Turn left.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.370
We'll avoid the traffic.

25:07.406 --> 25:10.206
- Uh, yeah, good call.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.677
(Scoffing)

25:13.812 --> 25:15.579
Shit!

25:15.615 --> 25:17.815
- OK, I'll take the subway.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.683
I have to go somewhere
before work anyway.

25:19.818 --> 25:21.017
- Wait, what is this errand?

25:21.053 --> 25:23.420
- I'll see you at the office.

25:23.422 --> 25:24.388
- Ev, you--

25:31.130 --> 25:32.762
♪ ♪ ♪

25:53.252 --> 25:55.052
♪ ♪ ♪

26:31.423 --> 26:33.223
- You followed me?

26:33.259 --> 26:34.558
- Are you sick?

26:36.929 --> 26:38.762
- No, it's not that.

26:38.764 --> 26:41.432
- Well, then what is it?

26:41.567 --> 26:43.633
- I'm late.

26:43.669 --> 26:46.236
- A-a-are you pregnant?

26:46.238 --> 26:47.304
- I don't know.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.508
I had to do
a more accurate test.

26:53.913 --> 26:56.380
- You--you took a test
without telling me?

26:56.515 --> 26:57.548
(Door opening)

26:57.550 --> 26:58.615
- Ms. Landry?

26:58.750 --> 26:59.650
- Evelyn...

26:59.785 --> 27:00.951
- Can we talk after?

27:02.254 --> 27:03.187
OK.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.059
- Come on in.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.800
(Breathing heavily)

27:21.774 --> 27:23.474
- Were you ever gonna tell me?

27:24.810 --> 27:27.711
- I needed to know for myself.

27:28.614 --> 27:29.813
And you were
consumed with work.

27:29.882 --> 27:32.382
- This is more important.

27:37.956 --> 27:39.589
Evelyn, you gotta talk to me.

27:42.294 --> 27:45.562
- I didn't tell you
because I think I'm done...

27:45.965 --> 27:48.031
with us.

27:53.272 --> 27:54.304
- No.

27:56.942 --> 27:59.243
No, we're not over.

27:59.378 --> 28:00.778
This isn't over.

28:00.780 --> 28:04.248
- Phil, you can't honestly say
that we've been good...

28:05.051 --> 28:07.417
that you're happy, that...

28:08.521 --> 28:10.254
I know I'm not.

28:11.657 --> 28:13.389
- Do you not love me anymore?

28:13.426 --> 28:15.993
- No, that's not the issue.
- That's the only issue.

28:17.263 --> 28:20.163
Ev, you gotta give me
a chance here.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.833
OK? To--to prove...

28:24.970 --> 28:27.137
to prove to you
that I can make this work, OK?

28:27.139 --> 28:28.872
You--you gotta give me time.

28:30.643 --> 28:32.476
Please?

28:32.545 --> 28:35.678
Ma--maybe this is a sign.

28:37.616 --> 28:38.882
You know?

28:38.884 --> 28:40.416
A fresh start.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.224
(Phone chiming)

28:47.293 --> 28:49.459
- We should go inside
before he blows nuclear.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.696
- Can we talk more
about this tonight?

28:52.831 --> 28:53.897
- Um, I made plans with Naomi.

28:53.899 --> 28:56.633
The house will be
full of fumes.

28:56.702 --> 28:58.468
- Fumes?

29:01.874 --> 29:02.372
Oh shit!

29:02.374 --> 29:04.440
Right, the paint.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.679
What colour did
you want again?

29:10.483 --> 29:12.049
- Vanilla.
- Vanilla, right.

29:12.051 --> 29:12.916
- Why?
You ordered it, right?

29:12.918 --> 29:13.984
(Keys clanging)

29:14.119 --> 29:16.886
- Yeah, absolutely.

29:22.762 --> 29:23.727
(Elevator chiming)

29:23.862 --> 29:25.262
Uh, tell Pat
I'll be right in.

29:25.331 --> 29:26.396
- Mm-hmm.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.231
(Phone ringing)

29:33.072 --> 29:36.073
- Cedric, hey,
have you started on the bedroom?

29:36.075 --> 29:37.441
<i> How's the vanilla going?</i>

29:37.576 --> 29:41.812
- Uh, you mean the steel blue,
because that's what you ordered.

29:41.881 --> 29:42.813
(Sighing)

29:42.948 --> 29:45.215
- Stop painting now.

29:45.284 --> 29:45.949
- They almost did
the first coat.

29:46.084 --> 29:47.017
-<i> No, stop.</i>

29:47.086 --> 29:48.018
I'll finish it.

29:48.153 --> 29:50.487
-<i> Uh, your brother showed up.</i>

29:50.622 --> 29:51.889
<i> I thought we had a deal?</i>

29:51.891 --> 29:52.823
- We do.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.891
Ugh! Put him on.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.027
- For you.

29:59.031 --> 29:59.963
(Sighing)

30:00.032 --> 30:01.031
- Yeah?

30:01.100 --> 30:04.501
- Andy? You're fired.

30:04.636 --> 30:05.569
- Oh, come on.

30:05.638 --> 30:06.837
Why? Because I'm late?

30:06.972 --> 30:08.972
-<i> No, because</i>
<i> you're unreliable.</i>

30:08.974 --> 30:10.507
- I'm no leech.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.109
I only charge you
for the days that I work.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.645
- It has nothing
to do with that.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.046
-<i> Wha--what am I supposed</i>
<i> to tell Miriam, huh?</i>

30:16.115 --> 30:18.315
That I can't pay
child support?

30:18.450 --> 30:20.450
You think she's gonna
let me see my daughter?

30:20.452 --> 30:22.052
Think this helps
keep me sober?

30:22.054 --> 30:23.987
- Look, I'll help you
find another job. OK?

30:24.056 --> 30:26.389
I'll come over tonight.
We'll strategize.

30:26.525 --> 30:27.658
- Fuck strategy.

30:27.793 --> 30:28.725
You're my brother.

30:28.861 --> 30:31.161
- Andy, I gotta do things
differently this t--

30:31.163 --> 30:32.729
(Phone beeping)

30:33.732 --> 30:35.465
- Everything's there,
you just need

30:35.467 --> 30:36.967
to merge it with the rest
of the file and print it.

30:37.102 --> 30:39.636
- Can you do it?
We lost our intern.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.738
- And you still
don't have a receptionist.

30:41.740 --> 30:44.608
- Well, after we sign Keas,
it'll be a whole new ball game.

30:44.743 --> 30:45.576
- It better be.

30:45.711 --> 30:47.944
- Uh, why don't I handle
the documents, actually.

30:47.980 --> 30:48.879
It's not fair
Evelyn has to pick up

30:49.014 --> 30:49.946
the slack, right?

30:50.082 --> 30:52.548
We should chip in.

30:52.585 --> 30:54.751
In fact, why don't I
set up the interviews

30:54.887 --> 30:55.419
for the new hires?

30:55.554 --> 30:57.720
- All that by yourself?

30:59.057 --> 31:02.092
- Come on, we hired Evelyn
to be a part-time paralegal.

31:02.161 --> 31:04.127
Now she's working,
what, sixty hours a week?

31:04.129 --> 31:04.961
No, that stops now.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.731
Evelyn, I got it.

31:10.235 --> 31:12.735
Grimmer and Landry.

31:14.106 --> 31:16.339
Yes, speaking?

31:17.509 --> 31:18.708
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:18.777 --> 31:20.176
- Everything OK with you?
- Yeah, what about you?

31:20.212 --> 31:22.179
Want to tell me
what you wouldn't say

31:22.181 --> 31:23.046
at the bar last night?

31:23.181 --> 31:25.348
- Bar?

31:27.553 --> 31:29.452
- Is everything OK
with you and Eric?

31:30.556 --> 31:32.455
- Uh, sure. Great.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.357
- Nothing you want
to tell me?

31:34.393 --> 31:36.059
- No. Why?

31:36.061 --> 31:38.595
Is your section of
the presentation ready?

31:38.730 --> 31:39.829
- Yeah, almost.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.030
I just have to look it over
again in the morning.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.200
- Big day tomorrow.
Let's nail it.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.703
- Uh, hold on one second.

31:47.873 --> 31:49.472
Ev!

31:49.508 --> 31:50.741
Hey, Ev!

31:50.876 --> 31:51.808
Ev.

31:51.844 --> 31:52.842
Ev!

31:53.345 --> 31:55.145
- Yeah?

32:02.688 --> 32:05.121
- I'll see you at home
after Naomi's?

32:06.058 --> 32:08.160
- Yeah, of course.
- OK.

32:08.160 --> 32:08.258
Take your time.
- Yeah, of course.
- OK.

32:08.258 --> 32:09.792
Take your time.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.095
Have fun.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.296
(Elevator chiming)

32:18.037 --> 32:19.736
(Knocking on door)

32:20.906 --> 32:21.838
(Sighing)

32:21.974 --> 32:22.973
- About time, bro.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.577
Strategy my ass.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.511
(Chuckling)

32:29.247 --> 32:32.115
Oh, Miriam.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.184
- You've been drinking.

32:36.789 --> 32:39.990
Do you at least have
this month's child support?

32:41.593 --> 32:42.659
- No.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.334
♪ ♪ ♪

33:27.272 --> 33:29.706
(Crickets chirping)

33:36.448 --> 33:39.182
- OK, so, they did
the wrong colour?

33:39.651 --> 33:41.384
- Uh...

33:42.521 --> 33:45.322
yeah, but, uh, actually,
it's--it's my fault.

33:45.324 --> 33:47.324
I got it wrong.

33:48.427 --> 33:49.860
Now I'm trying to fix it.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.597
- Well, you're not
doing a great job.

33:53.732 --> 33:54.264
(Chuckling)

33:54.399 --> 33:56.199
- Yeah, I was hoping, uh,

33:56.334 --> 33:57.266
it'd be the attempt
that counted.

33:57.302 --> 34:00.169
(Chuckling)

34:02.641 --> 34:04.541
Ev, I, uh...

34:06.311 --> 34:08.812
I haven't been
listening to you.

34:08.814 --> 34:12.281
We both know this isn't
the life you wanted, right?
