01:07.374 --> 01:10.009
Learn Zone? Mom, you said
we were going someplace fun.

01:10.951 --> 01:12.430
Yeah, Mom,
you promised!

01:12.475 --> 01:14.822
Homer, I told you,
don't call me "Mom."

01:14.922 --> 01:16.589
Sorry, Mrs. Simpson.

01:25.282 --> 01:26.449
Ooh!

01:26.484 --> 01:28.051
This isn't
a learn zone.

01:28.085 --> 01:29.469
Darn it,
it's a fun place!

01:29.503 --> 01:30.987
- Yay!
-  Yay!

01:34.191 --> 01:36.993
For maximum safety,
all children must wear

01:37.028 --> 01:38.978
anti-kidnapping bracelets.

01:40.231 --> 01:42.999
Is this a kid
<i>you'd</i> pay ransom for?

01:43.034 --> 01:45.268
Dad, what would you do
if you got my ear in the mail?

01:45.302 --> 01:46.770
I don't know.
Feed it to the dog?

01:46.804 --> 01:47.971
You'd have
to wrap cheese around it.

01:48.005 --> 01:50.407
Don't you tell me
how to feed you to the dog!

02:01.235 --> 02:02.802
Whoa!

02:02.837 --> 02:04.487
Where do they go?

02:04.505 --> 02:05.522
Whoa!

02:07.508 --> 02:09.309
Welcome to the Mormon Church,

02:09.342 --> 02:11.344
America's most respectable cult.

02:12.546 --> 02:13.913
Keep an eye on
the kids, Homer.

02:13.948 --> 02:15.915
Can I keep an eye
on that kid?

02:17.568 --> 02:18.868
He's fabulous.

02:18.903 --> 02:20.220
Bart and Lisa.

02:20.254 --> 02:22.989
Oh! It's always <i>my</i> kids.

02:23.023 --> 02:24.707
Yay!

02:25.843 --> 02:27.143
Where'd they go?

02:27.177 --> 02:28.812
Oh. Hmm.

02:28.846 --> 02:31.481
Almost.

02:32.049 --> 02:34.184
Holy moley.

02:34.218 --> 02:35.985
What the...?!

02:37.521 --> 02:38.872
Oh, it's hopeless!

02:38.906 --> 02:40.106
What's hopeless?

02:40.141 --> 02:41.841
Who the hell are you?

02:44.528 --> 02:45.979
Dad, come up, come up!
Pretty, pretty please!

02:46.013 --> 02:47.347
Absolutely not!

02:47.381 --> 02:49.349
My adult frame
is simply too large.

02:49.383 --> 02:50.850
Come on, Dad!
No! Never!

02:50.885 --> 02:52.719
Come on, Dad!
Fine.

02:52.753 --> 02:54.721
Here I come.

02:54.755 --> 02:56.306
Crawling.

02:56.340 --> 02:58.324
So... painful.

02:59.643 --> 03:00.894
Duck walk.

03:00.928 --> 03:03.379
Infinitely worse. Ooh!

03:06.200 --> 03:08.201
Only wanted...
to be fun.

03:08.235 --> 03:09.469
Shh, shh, shh.

03:09.503 --> 03:11.921
Soon you'll know peace.

03:18.362 --> 03:19.679
I made it, kids!

03:19.713 --> 03:23.516
I am king
of Learnington Castle!

03:23.551 --> 03:25.685
We tricked you.

03:25.719 --> 03:27.253
Eat Nerf, Homeboy!

03:27.288 --> 03:31.274
Real... mature...!

03:32.610 --> 03:34.377
Yay!

03:34.411 --> 03:37.647
Ralphie!

03:38.649 --> 03:40.717
Huh? Hmm.

03:40.751 --> 03:42.368
What cool kid
thing's in here?

03:42.403 --> 03:44.687
No kids. That's what's cool.

03:49.276 --> 03:51.461
I have a phone.
It's very tiny.

03:51.495 --> 03:53.730
Ain't no shame
in being poor, boy.

03:53.764 --> 03:56.633
What's pitiful is
if you is ignorant.

03:56.667 --> 03:59.736
Is these mice pillows here
for the taking?

03:59.770 --> 04:01.037
I hate working here.

04:01.071 --> 04:02.539
At least at Krustyburger,

04:02.573 --> 04:04.724
you could burn yourself
and go home.

04:07.261 --> 04:09.362
Unauthorized child departure.

04:09.396 --> 04:10.563
Lockdown mode initiated.

04:16.687 --> 04:18.704
Another stupid kid got out.

04:18.738 --> 04:20.773
I can't tell the manager.

04:20.808 --> 04:23.076
I <i>am</i> the manager. Duh!

04:23.110 --> 04:25.261
We're locked in!

04:26.964 --> 04:29.782
These lasers are nothing more
than colored lights!

04:29.817 --> 04:31.985
Calm down, everyone.
Calm down.

04:32.019 --> 04:34.153
I'm sure they'll have us
out of here soon.

04:34.188 --> 04:36.055
Until then, why don't we bond

04:36.090 --> 04:37.957
by sharing
our childbirth experiences.

04:37.992 --> 04:40.326
The nurses
were so great.

04:40.361 --> 04:42.896
My husband held
my hand the whole time.

04:42.930 --> 04:45.615
See? All you need
to get through a crisis

04:45.649 --> 04:47.517
is a little
friendly conversation.

04:47.551 --> 04:50.153
Bet you the dads
are doing the same thing.

04:54.408 --> 04:56.259
The sneeze guard is broken!

04:56.293 --> 04:58.261
There is no law!

04:58.295 --> 05:00.663
Oh, I just came here
to pick up my daughter.

05:00.698 --> 05:02.649
But now I'm gonna
kill you all!

05:04.385 --> 05:05.985
Don't forget your
jacket, sweetie.

05:10.457 --> 05:12.025
Get out of
there, you!

05:12.059 --> 05:13.509
Never!

05:15.029 --> 05:17.413
Mmm. Butter.

05:26.705 --> 05:28.172
Round and round.

05:28.206 --> 05:29.807
Round and round.

05:31.243 --> 05:33.561
Freedom!

05:35.614 --> 05:36.931
Let's get out of
here! Come on!

05:41.102 --> 05:43.120
Apes. Deep down,
we're all savage apes.

05:43.154 --> 05:45.055
Leave your body, Homer.

05:47.492 --> 05:49.693
What the hell was that?

05:51.296 --> 05:53.764
You've been through
a traumatic experience.

05:53.798 --> 05:56.300
Are you sure you want
to go to work today?

05:56.334 --> 05:57.902
Well, I've taken
eight months off.

05:57.936 --> 06:00.838
It's time to get
back on the horse.

06:06.044 --> 06:08.279
Ho, ho, ho.

06:08.313 --> 06:10.748
Ho, ho, ho.

06:10.782 --> 06:13.901
Hey, neighbor, your welcome
mat's looking a little dusty.

06:13.935 --> 06:16.086
Mind if I come over
and sweeten your greetin'.

06:16.121 --> 06:17.721
Sweeten your greetin'!

06:17.756 --> 06:19.523
Sweeten your greetin'.

06:19.557 --> 06:21.392
Three Neds are better than one!

06:28.917 --> 06:31.318
I hate to be a nag,
but this is my real head.

06:36.558 --> 06:40.394
I guess, despite all
our so-called civilization,

06:40.428 --> 06:42.529
anarchy lurks
around every corner,

06:42.564 --> 06:44.632
like a racially-diverse
street gang

06:44.666 --> 06:46.667
on a network cop show.

06:46.701 --> 06:50.871
My friend, you just experienced
W.R.O.L. firsthand.

06:50.905 --> 06:52.673
Hey, hey, read the sign, pal,
no acronyms.

06:52.707 --> 06:53.974
You see?

06:54.009 --> 06:56.176
And that goes
for the rest of youse, too!

06:56.211 --> 06:57.378
Okay, okay.

06:57.412 --> 06:59.980
Hey, in this bar,
we say "Old Kinderhook!"

07:00.015 --> 07:01.882
What's W.R.O.L.?

07:01.916 --> 07:03.817
It means "Without
the Rule of Law."

07:03.852 --> 07:07.287
Anarchy. The end
of civilization.

07:07.322 --> 07:09.823
Coming soon
to an America near you.

07:09.858 --> 07:11.425
America can't collapse!

07:11.459 --> 07:13.861
We're as powerful
as ancient Rome!

07:13.895 --> 07:16.497
Ah, take a
look at this.

07:16.531 --> 07:17.881
<i>The modern world--</i>

07:17.916 --> 07:20.351
<i>an inexorable march</i>
<i>of progress.</i>

07:20.385 --> 07:21.518
Sweet.

07:21.553 --> 07:22.686
<i>Or is it?</i>

07:24.022 --> 07:25.456
We're slaves to the system.

07:25.490 --> 07:27.925
Close the supermarket,
and we starve.

07:27.959 --> 07:30.527
Cut off the tap,
we drink our cat's blood.

07:39.204 --> 07:42.489
<i>Who will survive</i>
<i>in this new world?</i>

07:42.524 --> 07:46.393
<i>The man who is prepared.</i>

07:57.238 --> 07:58.572
Oh, my God!

07:58.606 --> 08:00.407
This unsourced,
undated video

08:00.442 --> 08:02.242
has convinced me
beyond any doubt!

08:02.277 --> 08:06.180
And I'm the guy you want to know
when the stuff hits the fan.

08:06.214 --> 08:08.282
Hey, man, no need
to almost swear.

08:08.316 --> 08:10.317
Come with me.

08:11.319 --> 08:12.886
Well, Homer's gone.

08:12.921 --> 08:16.090
Let's all go into our suspended
state till he gets back.

08:21.930 --> 08:25.799
Homer, meet
the Springfield Preppers.

08:25.834 --> 08:28.402
Preppies? Oh, I hate you guys!

08:28.436 --> 08:31.338
Always partying on deck
with your Docksiders

08:31.372 --> 08:34.073
while us townies
are scrubbing the bilge!

08:34.109 --> 08:35.743
Not preppies. Preppers.

08:35.777 --> 08:38.078
But I like your hatred.

08:38.113 --> 08:39.546
It's based on nothing.

08:39.581 --> 08:41.048
That's super.

08:41.082 --> 08:44.718
Now, Homer, what would you do
in the case of an E.M.P.?

08:46.020 --> 08:48.889
Electromagnetic pulse.

08:50.291 --> 08:51.525
A burst of radiation

08:51.559 --> 08:53.894
that knocks out every electrical
system in the country.

08:53.928 --> 08:55.229
I'd slash my wrists.

08:55.263 --> 08:57.197
But how,
without my electric knife?!

08:57.232 --> 08:59.716
There is an alternative
to suicide.

08:59.751 --> 09:01.618
Mm. I can't conceive of any.

09:01.653 --> 09:04.988
We can teach you the skills
you need to survive any crisis.

09:05.023 --> 09:05.923
Ooh.

09:05.957 --> 09:07.157
All we ask is

09:07.192 --> 09:08.926
that you keep
your prepping secret.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.829
We won't have room
for all the unprepared.

09:11.863 --> 09:15.299
Don't worry. I'm very good
at keeping secrets.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.301
"Impending doom."

09:17.335 --> 09:18.469
What you reading, Dad?

09:19.671 --> 09:21.004
Honey, everything's fine.

09:21.039 --> 09:22.773
There's nothing to worry about.

09:22.807 --> 09:24.374
When grown-ups say that,

09:24.409 --> 09:26.643
it means there <i>is</i> something
to worry about.

09:26.678 --> 09:28.378
Just go play your saxophone.

09:28.413 --> 09:29.847
While you can.

09:29.881 --> 09:30.914
What does that mean?

09:30.949 --> 09:33.016
Secrets? I have no secrets!

09:33.051 --> 09:34.885
Just enjoy this golden time

09:34.919 --> 09:37.688
you will soon cling desperately
to the memory of.

09:37.722 --> 09:40.023
Smell some bread!

09:41.059 --> 09:43.026
When things go south,

09:43.061 --> 09:47.030
the <i>sheeple</i> will clean out
every supermarket in town.

09:47.065 --> 09:48.432
Typical sheeple.

09:48.466 --> 09:52.152
Uh... are you eating my grain?

09:52.187 --> 09:53.954
Maybe.

09:53.988 --> 09:56.523
That was a five-pound bag!

09:56.558 --> 09:58.225
Yeah, but I'll go
home, weigh myself,

09:58.259 --> 10:00.160
and I'll have
gained <i>six</i> pounds.

10:00.195 --> 10:01.361
What's that about?

10:01.396 --> 10:03.163
♪ Prep, prep, prep.

10:04.499 --> 10:06.633
Hey, Dad, are we
going camping?

10:06.668 --> 10:09.536
I guess an open garage
isn't the best hiding place.

10:09.571 --> 10:11.538
What's up? Going
crazy again?

10:11.573 --> 10:13.240
I wish.

10:13.274 --> 10:15.509
Son, the best way
to explain this is

10:15.543 --> 10:18.645
to show you
some age-inappropriate movies.

10:24.986 --> 10:27.154
So, what have you
learned so far

10:27.188 --> 10:30.090
from our post-apocalyptic
movie marathon?

10:30.124 --> 10:33.327
Guys who call themselves
Preacher or Deacon are very bad.

10:33.361 --> 10:35.929
Water is money,
unless gasoline is money.

10:35.964 --> 10:38.131
And even though lots of things
are razor-sharp,

10:38.166 --> 10:39.366
no one ever shaves.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.668
Hollywood has
taught you well, my son.

10:41.703 --> 10:44.371
Now let's push play.

10:46.691 --> 10:49.259
Now the Ice Bishop
of Beverly Hills

10:49.294 --> 10:53.197
will teach you
the true meaning of cold!

10:57.252 --> 11:00.020
I have come from a place
where the land is warm,

11:00.054 --> 11:04.157
and the only ice is made
by machines called...

11:04.192 --> 11:06.627
fridge-ra-torrs.

11:06.661 --> 11:10.764
Fridge-ra-torrs!
Fridge-ra-torrs!

11:10.798 --> 11:12.432
Fridge-ra-torrs!

11:12.467 --> 11:14.301
Aren't they just
saying "refrigerator"?

11:14.335 --> 11:17.804
Do not question
the wisdom of Tom Skerritt.

11:18.740 --> 11:20.140
Here it is, Homer.

11:20.174 --> 11:22.542
The Springfield Preppers'
top secret Bug-Out Retreat.

11:22.577 --> 11:24.695
Wow! Your <i>end</i>
of the world

11:24.729 --> 11:27.197
is better than my
<i>during</i> the world.

11:27.232 --> 11:29.349
Homer, we all know
America's collapse

11:29.384 --> 11:31.184
is about three months away.

11:31.219 --> 11:33.186
Six weeks
at most.

11:33.221 --> 11:34.688
There's always one alarmist.

11:34.722 --> 11:36.623
Anyway, when
the Four Horsemen ride,

11:36.658 --> 11:39.426
we want you and your collaterals
right here with us.

11:39.460 --> 11:40.494
Aw.

11:40.528 --> 11:42.696
Uh, listen, I've got to know--

11:42.730 --> 11:44.564
you're not just being nice to me

11:44.599 --> 11:47.434
because in a pinch you could
make candles from my fat?

11:47.468 --> 11:48.802
Well, that is a big part of it.

11:48.836 --> 11:50.971
It's okay.
I know what I am.

11:53.141 --> 11:54.441
Hmm?

11:54.475 --> 11:56.843
I can't find
all our cereal crackers,

11:56.878 --> 11:59.446
juice boxes,
the butter brush...

11:59.480 --> 12:03.450
Um... a lot of that stuff
must've got lost in the move.

12:03.484 --> 12:05.218
What move?
We haven't moved.

12:05.253 --> 12:06.887
What's going on?

12:06.921 --> 12:10.724
Oh! I want to tell you, but I
promised to keep it a secret.

12:10.758 --> 12:13.627
You can't have secrets
from your wife!

12:13.661 --> 12:16.830
It's <i>very</i> late in the marriage
to tell me that.

12:16.864 --> 12:20.033
I've hidden all our supplies
behind a fake wall.

12:20.068 --> 12:22.736
I thought the basement
looked cleaner.

12:22.770 --> 12:24.871
See? These are
our bug-out bags.

12:24.906 --> 12:27.307
In here is everything
we need to survive.

12:27.342 --> 12:28.642
Survive what?

12:28.676 --> 12:31.111
The looming kablooey.

12:31.145 --> 12:33.981
It's reassuring to see
you're aware of the future,

12:34.015 --> 12:37.117
but this is all a little...
creepy.

12:37.151 --> 12:38.118
Creepy?!

12:38.152 --> 12:40.087
Marge, the apocalypse is coming.

12:40.121 --> 12:43.123
Maybe not tomorrow, maybe never,
but it's coming.

12:43.157 --> 12:45.125
And soon.

12:45.159 --> 12:47.110
I'm going to bed.

12:49.530 --> 12:52.699
There's no handle
on this side!

12:53.901 --> 12:56.486
The one thing
I couldn't prepare for.

12:59.918 --> 13:01.586
Oh, these here
are my snack chips.

13:01.637 --> 13:04.040
Your cheese puffs.
Those are doodles.

13:04.394 --> 13:06.395
I will eat anything orange
except an orange.

13:09.666 --> 13:11.967
And that's
how you deliver a baby calf

13:12.001 --> 13:14.803
with a bathroom plunger. Mm-hmm.

13:21.411 --> 13:22.845
An E.M.P.?!

13:22.879 --> 13:24.697
You know what
that means!

13:24.731 --> 13:27.049
Hand scissors.

13:38.595 --> 13:40.579
Oh.

14:02.285 --> 14:06.255
All electronics in Springfield
have been disabled.

14:06.289 --> 14:08.924
Even the musical greeting cards.

14:10.693 --> 14:12.694
This is it.
Bug-out time.

14:12.729 --> 14:16.115
Everyone but
us is doomed.

14:16.149 --> 14:18.233
I am so jazzed.

14:20.403 --> 14:21.937
Mr. Mayor, what's your
administration doing

14:21.971 --> 14:23.772
to ensure
there's no panic?

14:23.807 --> 14:26.158
I don't know. What is
<i>your</i> administration doing?

14:26.192 --> 14:27.593
There you have it.

14:27.627 --> 14:29.678
A town without rules,
without leadership,

14:29.712 --> 14:31.146
without television.

14:31.181 --> 14:33.916
This is Kent Brockman,
talking to himself.

14:35.251 --> 14:37.286
Marge, this is
it, TEOTWAWKI!

14:37.320 --> 14:39.955
"The end of the world
as we know it"?

14:39.989 --> 14:41.123
Uh-huh. Where's
the kids?

14:41.157 --> 14:42.958
Lisa and Maggie
are downstairs,

14:42.992 --> 14:45.227
and Bart's in his room
with Milhouse.

14:45.261 --> 14:46.995
Boy, get in the car,

14:47.030 --> 14:49.064
and say good-bye
to your best friend forever.

14:49.098 --> 14:50.432
Bye forever, Milhouse.

14:50.467 --> 14:51.633
See you, Bart.

14:53.436 --> 14:54.636
Mmm.

14:54.671 --> 14:56.104
This is my daughter.

14:56.139 --> 14:59.308
She brings the gift of
music to the new world.

14:59.342 --> 15:02.411
Is that sax alto or baritone?
Baritone.

15:02.445 --> 15:05.314
This is gonna be
a <i>long</i> apocalypse.

15:05.348 --> 15:06.748
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

15:06.783 --> 15:08.250
<i>Ay, caramba</i> indeed.

15:08.284 --> 15:09.451
Dad, how are we
supposed to spend

15:09.486 --> 15:10.686
the rest of
our lives here?

15:10.720 --> 15:12.020
We're already bored.

15:12.055 --> 15:14.156
Here's something
to pass the endless time.

15:14.190 --> 15:15.557
Write down which celebrities

15:15.592 --> 15:17.726
were rumored to be gay
for future generations.

15:17.760 --> 15:19.328
Yes, sir.

15:20.330 --> 15:21.697
Society will not

15:21.731 --> 15:23.932
have to start
from square one.

15:27.370 --> 15:29.605
Homie, I never thought
we'd turn our backs

15:32.876 --> 15:35.577
Marge, when I started prepping
for the end of the world,

15:35.612 --> 15:37.346
everyone laughed at me.

15:37.380 --> 15:38.714
No one was laughing.

15:38.748 --> 15:40.282
You kept it a secret!

15:40.316 --> 15:41.683
Well, just because
I imagined it,

15:41.718 --> 15:43.085
doesn't make it
any less true.

15:43.119 --> 15:45.988
And now all those
people are on their own.

15:46.022 --> 15:48.357
How can you call yourself
a Christian?

15:48.391 --> 15:51.693
If Jesus had a gun,
he'd be alive today.

15:51.728 --> 15:53.312
Homer Simpson!

15:53.346 --> 15:55.531
When I fell in love
with you,

15:55.565 --> 15:59.051
it was because of your big heart
and your good looks.

15:59.085 --> 16:02.187
But some day, those good looks
are gonna fade.

16:02.222 --> 16:03.655
What?!

16:04.991 --> 16:06.325
Soon we'll be approached

16:06.359 --> 16:08.827
by people
who haven't prepared.

16:08.862 --> 16:10.796
Now, do not look at their faces.

16:10.830 --> 16:12.998
That can trigger feelings
and emotions,

16:13.032 --> 16:15.651
which have no place

16:15.685 --> 16:19.488
in Civilization 2.0:
Rise of the Weirdos.

16:19.522 --> 16:21.490
I may have solved that problem.

16:21.524 --> 16:23.225
This rifle scope I modified

16:23.259 --> 16:27.229
makes any human face
look dangerous and threatening.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.334
Boom.

16:32.368 --> 16:34.069
Why do we have
to shoot them at all?

16:34.103 --> 16:36.204
Are you that good with a knife?

16:36.239 --> 16:39.675
No! I want to help the people
who didn't prepare.

16:39.709 --> 16:42.010
Boom. Boom.

16:42.045 --> 16:44.012
Boom.
What'd you shoot me for?

16:44.047 --> 16:46.582
You were thinking I'd gone mad
with power, weren't you?!

16:46.616 --> 16:48.150
I wasn't, but I am now.

16:48.184 --> 16:49.418
Boom-boom-
boom-boom-boom.

16:59.930 --> 17:01.030
Oh, God, now what?

17:01.065 --> 17:03.866
Every time you wake us up early
in the morning,

17:03.901 --> 17:06.868
it's either church or we have
to change our identities.

17:06.904 --> 17:09.539
Don't be silly,
Mary Ellen.

17:09.573 --> 17:11.074
Now we're going
to leave this place.

17:11.108 --> 17:12.224
I'm sorry, Bart.

17:12.259 --> 17:14.193
I know you've made
a bug-out camp girlfriend.

17:14.228 --> 17:15.468
I've got to be honest with you.

17:15.496 --> 17:17.864
It was just a bag of rice
I drew a face on.

17:17.897 --> 17:18.964
White ricer brown?

17:18.999 --> 17:19.816
I never noticed.

17:19.849 --> 17:20.883
Good boy.

17:20.917 --> 17:22.819
So we'll take these supplies

17:22.853 --> 17:25.121
back to Springfield where
they're needed most.

17:25.155 --> 17:28.057
You're a good man,
Homer Simpson.

17:32.579 --> 17:34.547
You said you cut the wires
to the alarm.

17:34.581 --> 17:36.883
Hmm, I cut the wires
to something.

17:47.473 --> 17:49.488
Okay everybody,
keep your eyes peeled

17:49.513 --> 17:53.465
for an unlit mile post marked
"23" or "36" or something.

17:53.483 --> 17:54.800
If we miss it, we're dead.

17:54.818 --> 17:56.902
Dad, there are lights
following us.

17:56.937 --> 17:59.572
How can that be?
I took every last can of gas.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.448
Now, everyone relax and pretend
we're about to be hit

18:09.483 --> 18:10.850
by a soft brick wall.

18:12.119 --> 18:13.819
Out of our way, corn!

18:13.837 --> 18:15.371
The starving people
of Springfield

18:15.422 --> 18:17.873
are desperately in need
of our delivery of canned corn,

18:17.924 --> 18:21.427
corn flakes
and flash frozen corn niblets!

18:31.304 --> 18:33.239
I'm proud of you.

18:33.273 --> 18:36.675
Society may have crumbled,
but our decency hasn't.

18:36.710 --> 18:39.578
Now to save these sorry souls
from a life of anarchy,

18:39.613 --> 18:43.182
starvation and having
sex for procreation.

18:44.217 --> 18:46.018
Huh?

18:50.540 --> 18:52.858
Oh, everything's normal.

18:52.893 --> 18:55.294
The world didn't end!

18:55.328 --> 18:58.631
Dad, you said people would be
drinking each other's blood.

18:58.665 --> 19:02.468
You got to watch a VHS
copy of <i>Red Dawn</i> 13 times!

19:02.502 --> 19:04.470
Stop complaining!

19:04.504 --> 19:06.038
What happened
with the E.M.P.?

19:06.073 --> 19:08.207
Only Springfield
lost power,

19:08.241 --> 19:11.143
you see, and after a few
days, it came back.

19:11.178 --> 19:13.696
Maybe a little bit brighter.

19:13.730 --> 19:15.898
And the spirit of neighborly
cooperation broke out

19:15.932 --> 19:18.868
as if all the weird,
angry people had left.

19:18.902 --> 19:20.603
Then society
didn't crumble?

19:20.637 --> 19:22.872
The zoo animals
weren't eaten?

19:22.906 --> 19:24.707
No-- well, a couple.

19:24.741 --> 19:28.878
This non-disaster
is a catastrophe!

19:28.912 --> 19:32.014
Are you really so disappointed
the world didn't end,

19:32.048 --> 19:34.150
just so you could
be proven right?

19:34.184 --> 19:35.284
No, no.

19:35.318 --> 19:37.286
It's just that,
in the new world,

19:37.320 --> 19:39.789
I would have been a big shot.

19:39.823 --> 19:41.090
Well, not for long.

19:41.124 --> 19:42.758
Me and the others
were planning

19:42.793 --> 19:45.127
to overthrow you
and seal you in a cave.

19:45.162 --> 19:47.530
Yeah, but what
you didn't know

19:47.564 --> 19:50.065
was I was gonna poison
all your drinking water.

19:50.100 --> 19:53.335
Which is why I'm only drinking
my own urine.

19:55.388 --> 19:58.390
Guys, can't you see
that even an imperfect society

19:58.425 --> 20:01.427
is better than the savagery
of creating a new one?

20:01.461 --> 20:03.762
I for one am glad we're stuck
with civilization,

20:03.797 --> 20:08.033
and I think we will be
for a long, long time.

20:17.748 --> 20:19.119
I'm hungry.

20:19.144 --> 20:21.112
Look, you can have
potato chips now,

20:21.113 --> 20:23.200
or if you wait ten
minutes, you can have

20:23.300 --> 20:24.852
all the brains
you can eat.

20:24.853 --> 20:26.100
I want both.
