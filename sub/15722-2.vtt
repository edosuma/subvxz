WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:03.360
Caroline, it's been six weeks,

00:03.440 --> 00:05.680
David is AWOL, face it.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.480
Look, you've lost
40 percent of your funding,

00:10.560 --> 00:11.800
your chief scientist,

00:11.840 --> 00:13.600
and a hell of a lot
of morale around here.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.360
I have a major investor
coming to the lab this week.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.160
I'd like you to meet Audrey Graves.

00:19.240 --> 00:20.760
In Toronto for the AIDS conference?

00:20.840 --> 00:22.040
I'll be speaking.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.600
- About Africa?
- Yes.

00:24.681 --> 00:26.396
Then I will be listening.

00:27.565 --> 00:31.070
- How's David Sandstrom's recuperation?
- It's going great.

00:34.164 --> 00:37.365
We have a disease outbreak.
Two in three die.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.640
You're on the verge
of a major goddamn epidemic.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.360
If you don't start
asking for more help now,

00:42.440 --> 00:44.120
you are seriously, seriously fucked.

00:45.897 --> 00:48.200
You may know science,

00:48.280 --> 00:50.400
you do not know China.

00:51.765 --> 00:52.952
Oh, look at that.

00:53.120 --> 00:56.160
Yeah, that lives in your colon,
it's crucial to natural body functions

00:56.200 --> 00:58.498
but if ingested or inhaled

00:59.603 --> 01:01.040
klebsiella can kill you.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.040
- David.
- Caroline, what a surprise.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.680
Any idea what this bacterium is?

01:05.760 --> 01:07.040
It's a freak.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.440
It's got pieces of bacillus
cereus and an old klebsiella.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.327
He must have been exposed to it once

01:11.422 --> 01:13.480
and now he has the antibodies to kill it.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.880
And when he kills the bacillus cereus...

01:14.960 --> 01:16.160
He kills the klebsiella.

01:16.402 --> 01:18.240
- Clever. Clever.
- So what are you gonna do,

01:18.320 --> 01:20.760
grab somebody off the street
and load them up with bacillus cereus?

01:20.965 --> 01:22.120
I volunteer.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.360
Don't do this.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.360
David, go home.

01:26.004 --> 01:27.080
Miss Graves...

01:28.120 --> 01:29.180
- Listen to me.
- Sean!

01:29.281 --> 01:31.817
This has AIDS, it's from Africa.
It's a new strain.

01:31.955 --> 01:33.080
Police, don't move!

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:43.297 --> 01:44.960
He's in cardiac arrest.

02:05.020 --> 02:06.220
The syringe, where will it go?

02:06.300 --> 02:08.404
- The crime lab.
- What about the blood inside?

02:08.515 --> 02:10.740
- Forensics will have it.
- Okay.

02:13.011 --> 02:14.479
He has no vitals.

02:16.272 --> 02:18.635
I'm a doctor.
He's been shot once in the head.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.808
Could you come with me?

02:36.527 --> 02:38.466
She was stabbed
in the neck with a syringe.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.994
I'm just gonna make a phone call, okay?

02:42.804 --> 02:44.336
- It will be all right.
- Okay.

02:44.995 --> 02:46.240
I can't... I can't...

02:46.280 --> 02:48.840
I have to make a phone call...
don't touch me...

02:49.107 --> 02:50.320
Don't touch me!

02:51.360 --> 02:52.704
Relax. M'am.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.548
Miss Graves, listen to me.
You have to lie down.

02:55.652 --> 02:57.557
- I need a telephone.
- You're in shock.

02:57.618 --> 03:00.108
You've been injected with
a hypodermic and possibly exposed to HIV.

03:00.212 --> 03:00.840
There's somebody I need to...

03:00.920 --> 03:02.440
I need you to lie down
in this stretcher please.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.458
Oh, no I can't.

03:03.868 --> 03:05.520
Miss Graves, Miss Graves.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.956
- I can't... I...
- Are you having a boy or a girl?

03:08.474 --> 03:09.808
A boy or girl?

03:11.625 --> 03:13.671
- A boy.
- What's his name?

03:14.448 --> 03:15.868
What's his name?

03:18.545 --> 03:19.660
Richard.

03:19.740 --> 03:22.516
Okay, I want you
to lie down for Richard.

03:24.769 --> 03:27.620
I need you to lie down
for Richard. Okay?

05:00.890 --> 05:03.238
2x02 - Escape Mutant

05:19.872 --> 05:21.944
Hey man, you got
a cell phone I could borrow?

05:30.724 --> 05:32.908
How about a cell phone I could rent?

05:42.732 --> 05:43.768
Morrison.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.265
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

05:46.344 --> 05:47.121
David?

05:47.423 --> 05:48.600
Where are you?

05:48.740 --> 05:50.863
Uh, I'm at the corner of...

05:51.653 --> 05:54.240
broken down streetcar and homeless guy.

05:54.537 --> 05:55.711
<i>You're in Toronto?</i>

05:56.402 --> 05:58.784
- Yup.
- I want to talk to you.

06:02.665 --> 06:03.735
He'll be fine.

06:05.268 --> 06:06.770
He looks great.

06:11.907 --> 06:13.417
He'll be fine.

06:52.596 --> 06:54.570
Still infectious diseases, eh?

06:54.934 --> 06:56.207
What's going on?

06:56.536 --> 06:57.436
Come.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.720
No, the HIV physician in Amsterdam.

07:05.029 --> 07:06.457
Yeah, Dietrich!

07:06.631 --> 07:07.783
Fly him in.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.640
Well I'm not an idiot,
just get him here.

07:11.155 --> 07:15.112
They won't let me fly so just
call my OB and get her in here too.

07:16.657 --> 07:17.618
Okay.

07:21.217 --> 07:22.056
Audrey...

07:22.143 --> 07:24.645
- I just want to get out of here.
- I know and you will.

07:25.511 --> 07:28.100
Right now the syringe
that was used on you is at NORBAC.

07:28.953 --> 07:30.996
Why?  I thought it was going
to Crossfields in San Francisco.

07:31.238 --> 07:33.450
Well the police
didn't release it till an hour ago.

07:33.963 --> 07:35.876
It would take a day
to ship it to Crossfields

07:35.971 --> 07:37.789
and I think we're all anxious for results.

07:37.859 --> 07:39.945
- You think?
- So we'll test it for you.

07:40.384 --> 07:42.349
I know you want
the best labs working on this,

07:42.488 --> 07:44.868
the best people.
I have David Sandstrom.

07:49.890 --> 07:51.639
Yeah, David Sandstrom.

07:55.091 --> 07:57.802
Well, first of all, NORBAC will find out

07:57.871 --> 07:59.589
if it was HIV injected into you

07:59.714 --> 08:01.860
and not you know, cherry Kool-Aid.

08:02.015 --> 08:05.015
And if it is HIV... The kid who
attacked you said it was a new strain?

08:05.533 --> 08:07.532
Yes, from Africa.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.150
Okay, well it's not unusual
to have new strains.

08:10.211 --> 08:12.075
If it is new, NORBAC
will find out what makes it new

08:12.162 --> 08:13.975
and determine the best treatment.
In the meantime

08:14.078 --> 08:16.294
the hospital has you on anti-retrovirals?

08:17.658 --> 08:20.097
Uh, Trizivir with a
synergistic enhancer.

08:20.201 --> 08:21.470
Good, that's good.

08:22.357 --> 08:23.591
So I'll...

08:23.972 --> 08:25.824
go talk to the team back at the lab

08:25.936 --> 08:29.152
and find out if there's anything more
that can be done for you.

08:31.003 --> 08:32.075
And  what about my baby?

08:32.337 --> 08:32.890
Oh...

08:33.986 --> 08:35.644
You know if we assume the worst

08:35.756 --> 08:37.051
and you do progress to infection,

08:37.474 --> 08:39.783
the HIV is very unlikely
to cross the placenta.

08:39.956 --> 08:43.379
So the very best place for him
right now is exactly where he is, you know,

08:44.406 --> 08:45.658
right inside you.

08:50.342 --> 08:51.550
David, thank you.

08:51.637 --> 08:53.818
Why do you want NORBAC
involved in a single medical case?

08:53.957 --> 08:56.888
We'll talk about it later.
Right now I want you to go to the lab,

08:57.026 --> 09:00.104
Carlos is already working on this.
I want you to examine the diagnostics

09:00.182 --> 09:02.182
- and figure out what to do next.
- At the lab?

09:02.269 --> 09:03.147
Yeah.

09:04.593 --> 09:07.451
I kind of fired my ass
a couple of months ago, remember?

09:09.966 --> 09:11.429
We'll talk at the lab, David.

09:27.309 --> 09:28.936
Uh, Mr. MacPherson.

09:29.555 --> 09:30.984
You're the scientist?

09:31.400 --> 09:33.309
Yes, Carlos Serrano.

09:33.456 --> 09:34.693
Thank you for seeing me.

09:35.222 --> 09:36.668
How was your flight?

09:37.114 --> 09:38.057
Long.

09:39.161 --> 09:41.438
Too much time on my hands to think.

09:41.516 --> 09:44.404
Thinking's not good
when you're travelling to...

09:46.600 --> 09:48.150
to pick up your son to...

09:49.712 --> 09:51.634
I don't understand what happened.

09:51.730 --> 09:53.167
He's not a madman.

09:53.613 --> 09:54.825
Why would he?

09:55.137 --> 09:57.890
He stabbed some pregnant woman
with a needle?

09:58.891 --> 10:01.196
Please come on.
Have a seat Mr. MacPherson.

10:10.565 --> 10:11.920
Do you know what that is?

10:12.824 --> 10:14.465
Sean was wearing it.

10:14.616 --> 10:15.482
No.

10:16.097 --> 10:17.924
It's a comfort doll pendant.

10:18.871 --> 10:21.892
People all across Canada
make the actual doll

10:22.264 --> 10:24.746
and  then send them to Africa
as packing material

10:24.787 --> 10:26.679
in the medical supply boxes.

10:29.922 --> 10:32.408
They are given to babies and children

10:32.494 --> 10:33.833
that are dying of AIDS.

10:33.971 --> 10:35.128
The poor things.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.141
When volunteers leave Africa,

10:38.210 --> 10:39.776
they're given a pendant.

10:40.269 --> 10:42.038
I've never been to Africa.

10:43.700 --> 10:46.035
When I saw that
your son was wearing one

10:46.441 --> 10:48.700
I knew that
he had seen what I've seen.

10:49.580 --> 10:52.940
I had to leave Africa.
I was a doctor with MSF and...

10:53.165 --> 10:55.022
I could have very easily been

10:55.091 --> 10:57.698
swallowed up in
the anger and pain that Sean was.

10:57.806 --> 10:59.334
Is that what happened to Sean?

11:00.594 --> 11:02.502
It was a desperate cry and...

11:03.020 --> 11:04.580
things got out of hand.

11:08.645 --> 11:10.277
But this, this is a sign

11:10.398 --> 11:12.755
that your son was a person of compassion.

11:20.455 --> 11:21.602
Audrey...

11:22.736 --> 11:25.141
Can I call anyone for you?

11:25.321 --> 11:26.391
Your husband?

11:28.157 --> 11:29.532
I'm not married.

11:30.896 --> 11:31.720
Oh.

11:34.047 --> 11:36.497
Well is there someone
who can come and stay with you

11:36.636 --> 11:38.540
till you get the okay to travel?

11:38.680 --> 11:39.771
A friend?

11:40.509 --> 11:41.825
The baby's father?

11:43.467 --> 11:45.843
My baby's father is donor 0133

11:46.014 --> 11:48.180
at the New Manhattan Fertility Clinic.

11:49.908 --> 11:51.877
Do you have children, Caroline?

11:52.743 --> 11:53.749
No.

12:06.949 --> 12:10.052
<i>You want it bad, a superman</i>

12:10.234 --> 12:13.732
<i>To take up the task at hand, and...</i>

12:15.162 --> 12:18.099
<i>bleed for you</i>

12:20.185 --> 12:23.930
<i>You smoking gun, you riot of one</i>

12:24.133 --> 12:29.643
<i>Put down the muscle and come up a fighter</i>

12:32.505 --> 12:35.589
<i>Lions rage</i>

12:35.989 --> 12:41.579
<i>They rattle their cage like they do</i>

12:44.017 --> 12:49.234
<i>Like the fools parading,
they're waiting in vain</i>

12:53.102 --> 12:55.758
<i>For superman</i>

12:56.137 --> 12:58.698
<i>For superman</i>

12:59.306 --> 13:02.133
<i>For superman</i>

13:23.015 --> 13:23.837
Hi.

13:24.600 --> 13:25.613
David!

13:25.741 --> 13:27.160
David.

13:27.731 --> 13:30.601
How sweet of you to grace us
with your presence.

13:30.739 --> 13:32.457
Good to see you too Mayko.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.511
- Hey Jill.
- David, it's nice to see you.

13:34.724 --> 13:36.100
- Uh, we should talk.
- Yeah, we should.

13:36.495 --> 13:37.701
Bob. Bob,

13:37.946 --> 13:40.336
I got you a souvenir from China.

13:41.660 --> 13:42.539
Okay.

13:43.504 --> 13:44.539
David.

13:46.113 --> 13:48.769
So China, People's Liberation Army.
What was that all about?

13:48.951 --> 13:51.607
It's a long story for another time
if you're buying the beer.

13:55.149 --> 13:56.739
I'll be back in two minutes.

13:56.856 --> 13:58.584
- Sure.
- Tell me all about China.

14:01.180 --> 14:02.619
So here I am.

14:02.843 --> 14:03.974
I'm glad you're back.

14:04.305 --> 14:05.980
Yeah, good to... Uh, here.

14:38.396 --> 14:39.246
Bob.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.323
I'll be back in two minutes.

14:45.484 --> 14:47.206
- Sure.
- Tell me all about China.

14:48.094 --> 14:48.907
So.

14:54.273 --> 14:56.120
Caroline, can I have a moment?

14:56.605 --> 14:57.493
Sure.

15:00.077 --> 15:02.303
How is Miss Graves doing?

15:03.303 --> 15:04.790
I think I calmed her down.

15:04.886 --> 15:06.299
She's gonna be okay.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.564
I know it's not my place
to get into the politics

15:14.660 --> 15:16.190
of what goes on in here.

15:16.275 --> 15:17.752
That's all right. What is it?

15:18.758 --> 15:20.801
It's about this money you're going after,

15:20.897 --> 15:23.529
Miss Graves and the American
Pharmaceutical Council.

15:23.695 --> 15:26.563
Carlos, we have
to make up 40 million dollars

15:26.777 --> 15:28.611
the United States cut
from our budget.

15:28.718 --> 15:31.703
I realize that but have you considered
the ramifications of that money.

15:31.805 --> 15:34.635
We may have to rearrange
our priorities at times, yeah.

15:34.731 --> 15:37.342
Half a million children
die every year in Africa

15:37.417 --> 15:40.915
because those same drug companies
do not have the financial interest

15:41.033 --> 15:43.665
in finding the proper dosages
for HIV infected children.

15:43.740 --> 15:46.201
- That's what we should be working on.
- I know what you're saying Carlos,

15:46.286 --> 15:48.180
and what I'm saying is...

15:48.597 --> 15:50.116
While we're doing this

15:50.191 --> 15:53.048
maybe we could discover something new.

15:55.092 --> 15:56.590
Oh, sorry. I'll come back.

15:57.061 --> 15:58.130
No, I'm finished, David.

16:04.819 --> 16:05.741
What is it?

16:08.206 --> 16:09.307
What's going on?

16:09.703 --> 16:12.312
Oh, uh... I'll have Wes

16:12.529 --> 16:15.543
-  bring you our current case files.
- No, no. I mean...

16:16.471 --> 16:17.844
What's going on?

16:18.040 --> 16:20.051
Me, here, how?

16:21.923 --> 16:25.031
Well I don't consider a Post-It note

16:25.127 --> 16:27.262
on a bottle of scotch a resignation.

16:30.387 --> 16:31.712
Nobody knows I quit.

16:31.982 --> 16:33.485
Only Wes knows.

16:33.753 --> 16:37.515
As far as everyone else is concerned
you were recovering

16:37.599 --> 16:40.104
from mental and physical exhaustion
sustained while

16:40.273 --> 16:42.796
solving the Spanish Flu outbreak
in Denver.

16:43.352 --> 16:45.490
You  spun me into a hero?

16:46.433 --> 16:48.541
If it got out my chief scientist quit

16:48.721 --> 16:50.829
in the middle of a crisis he created,

16:51.560 --> 16:53.828
NORBAC would have been finished.

16:54.666 --> 16:56.073
A tough six weeks.

16:58.436 --> 16:59.389
S o...

17:00.751 --> 17:02.265
Are you back?

17:05.252 --> 17:06.237
Yeah.

17:07.099 --> 17:08.026
Good.

17:10.421 --> 17:11.919
Yeah, good.

17:20.690 --> 17:22.930
What were you going to do
if I didn't come back?

17:24.790 --> 17:26.061
You did.

17:47.954 --> 17:49.146
What's going on?

17:50.012 --> 17:51.813
Wow, I missed hearing that from you.

17:52.736 --> 17:54.219
Come here. Look at this.

17:55.664 --> 17:58.872
A school lunch program
in a little Pennsylvania town.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.826
Kids ate chicken poisoned with a prion.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.508
- Oh shit.
- Yeah, three times a week for months.

18:05.659 --> 18:07.717
I remember that
whole mad cow disease scare.

18:07.872 --> 18:10.403
Well there's all this research
being done on them. While you were away,

18:10.570 --> 18:12.961
Caroline asked me to keep an eye on it.

18:13.082 --> 18:14.296
Lucky you.

18:15.450 --> 18:17.901
They were looking for
deteriorating effects of the disease:

18:17.977 --> 18:20.765
learning difficulties,
physical impairments.

18:22.584 --> 18:25.415
- I think I found something good.
- Something good? What?

18:25.550 --> 18:27.847
- Edmund Si at Columbia.
- Yeah, I know Eddie.

18:28.039 --> 18:30.572
Well he improved sea slug
memory with prion-like proteins.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.463
Yeah, well he could never get it
to work in a rat, let alone a human.

18:33.583 --> 18:34.867
I think it's possible.

18:37.251 --> 18:38.756
I'm listening.

18:39.438 --> 18:41.504
I've found I.Q. spikes.

18:41.610 --> 18:44.094
Sudden increases of 15-20 points.

18:44.214 --> 18:45.046
Wow.

18:45.227 --> 18:46.295
So we know there are people

18:46.386 --> 18:48.980
who survive the disease,
and we know some people die from it,

18:49.100 --> 18:50.229
but I think...

18:51.046 --> 18:53.896
Well I think there's a third group.
Those who thrive...

18:54.287 --> 18:55.612
get smarter.

18:55.808 --> 18:58.115
If you figure that out it'll be great news
for people with dementia.

18:58.206 --> 18:59.802
Alzheimer's, brain injuries.

18:59.881 --> 19:01.823
This is good shit, Mayko.
Where are you going next with this?

19:01.883 --> 19:03.950
Well I've read about
a British neuroscientist

19:04.070 --> 19:06.073
who's been working with people
exposed to mad cow.

19:06.208 --> 19:09.012
He's developing out there
tests with MRIs. It's very cool.

19:10.309 --> 19:12.357
- You two should hook up.
- He arrives tomorrow.

19:16.370 --> 19:17.198
What?

19:18.683 --> 19:19.821
Nothing.

19:21.950 --> 19:23.456
Good work, Mayko.

19:28.612 --> 19:29.844
Hey Bob...

19:30.438 --> 19:33.038
- Do you have RNA leader?
- I think so.

19:35.622 --> 19:37.006
What are you doing?

19:37.112 --> 19:38.816
Killing HIV.

19:38.911 --> 19:41.723
Do you get a perverse pleasure
from killing viruses?

19:41.831 --> 19:42.683
No.

19:44.962 --> 19:45.814
Hey...

19:47.865 --> 19:50.034
Did you wish David
would stay away forever?

19:51.915 --> 19:52.728
Yes.

19:54.230 --> 19:56.725
But not really.
Sometimes I guess. You?

19:57.687 --> 19:58.660
Same.

20:00.550 --> 20:01.569
Thank you.

20:04.798 --> 20:06.623
So the blood is HIV positive

20:06.730 --> 20:09.183
and the coroner confirmed
it was Sean's blood.

20:09.619 --> 20:11.140
Okay, so what do we do now?

20:11.277 --> 20:13.973
We can RT, genotype
and sequence this strain of HIV.

20:15.374 --> 20:17.336
What about Audrey,
what can we do for her?

20:17.488 --> 20:20.150
Nothing just yet.
She doesn't actually have HIV.

20:20.336 --> 20:23.549
But you just said the blood
she was infected with has HIV.

20:23.732 --> 20:26.080
I did, but right now
it's just free floating in her blood.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.280
Yeah see, it's gonna need a
couple weeks before it starts replicating

20:28.360 --> 20:29.634
and making a
permanent home in her cells.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.782
That's the point of no return, that's
infection, when we call her HIV positive.

20:32.952 --> 20:34.269
But HIV's a very weak virus

20:34.451 --> 20:36.951
and right now
the antiretrovirals are fighting back.

20:37.102 --> 20:39.135
Chances are HIV gives up,
disappears altogether.

20:39.455 --> 20:43.420
- And she would never get sick?
- Never get sick, never become HIV positive.

20:44.044 --> 20:46.760
- She's lucky in a way.
- Yeah, she's lucky.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.282
Six months pregnant and stabbed
with a syringe of HIV. I wish I was her.

20:50.589 --> 20:54.425
What I meant was... 40 million people
in the world have HIV or AIDS,

20:54.546 --> 20:57.153
and they did not suspect
a thing until they were infected.

20:58.574 --> 21:02.149
They did not have the luxury
of immediate antiretroviral therapy.

21:02.406 --> 21:04.994
I know. Let me know what you find.

21:08.020 --> 21:11.175
- What's say you and I get a beer later ?
- Sounds good.

21:11.875 --> 21:14.992
You can come too Bob
but you need to have a shitty week first.

21:16.059 --> 21:17.890
Okay, I'll get on it.

21:21.760 --> 21:23.500
Let's find out how Sean got infected.

21:24.637 --> 21:26.920
Let's also find out what kind
of drugs he's been treated with,

21:26.996 --> 21:29.202
- find out how the strain evolved.
- I'll call Africa.

21:29.293 --> 21:30.145
ASAP.

21:37.050 --> 21:39.285
So we finally got a virology lab, eh?

21:41.498 --> 21:42.411
Yeah.

21:45.725 --> 21:47.539
You think it's big enough?

21:47.691 --> 21:49.196
You signed off on it.

21:49.272 --> 21:52.238
Yeah, but in the model
it was only like this big, so...

21:53.615 --> 21:56.100
Are you being cute with me David?
'cause I'm...

21:56.478 --> 21:58.561
I'm really not in the mood for cute.

21:59.782 --> 22:03.219
Okay,  not cute, I'll need you
to run a RT-PCR for HIV on a blood,

22:03.360 --> 22:05.474
- Now.
- That'll take until 1 a.m.

22:05.641 --> 22:08.318
Yes it will.
You got someplace else to be?

22:10.782 --> 22:11.831
No.

22:17.261 --> 22:20.926
Jill, I know you're mad at me,

22:22.729 --> 22:24.531
but while I was away...

22:24.744 --> 22:27.253
I thought about a lot of things, and you.

22:27.793 --> 22:29.317
- You thought about me?
- Yeah.

22:29.763 --> 22:33.078
- Was I furious in your thoughts?
- You're always furious in my thoughts.

22:33.599 --> 22:35.942
- You left us holding the bag.
- I know.

22:38.180 --> 22:40.742
We had a vaccine to design.
Where were you?

22:40.900 --> 22:42.837
Oh, a leave of absence apparently.

22:42.962 --> 22:45.928
- Actually...
- Actually you were walking out the front door.

22:46.613 --> 22:48.701
You bailed on your own lab.

22:51.478 --> 22:54.368
Whatever. Just leave me to it.

22:54.777 --> 22:56.154
Again.

23:05.980 --> 23:08.916
Carlos no hablas es beer.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.509
- What are you doing?
- Give me a pipette.

23:13.615 --> 23:15.249
- Why?
- Just hand me a fucking pipette,

23:15.309 --> 23:16.656
we'll do the PCR together.

23:17.315 --> 23:20.265
You and me. Just like old times...

23:20.447 --> 23:21.794
till 1 A.M.

23:22.248 --> 23:23.716
Oh what fun.

23:45.283 --> 23:47.265
<i>The devastation,
the decimation of society.</i>

23:47.401 --> 23:51.151
<i>I don't think anybody yet
understands the full sweep</i>

23:51.440 --> 23:53.751
<i>of the carnage of the pandemic.
Death,</i>

23:53.903 --> 23:55.880
<i>death of a father, death of a mother,
death of an uncle, </i>

23:55.987 --> 23:57.614
<i>death of an aunt, death of a friend.</i>

23:57.751 --> 24:00.621
<i>We're just recognizing that
we are in one of the most intense</i>

24:00.727 --> 24:02.963
<i>human predicaments
this world has ever created.</i>

24:03.100 --> 24:04.518
<i>These are 10-year-olds.</i>

24:04.837 --> 24:07.905
<i>Death, country after country.</i>

24:09.544 --> 24:11.623
<i>Namibia, Malawi, Zambia,</i>

24:11.714 --> 24:13.552
<i>Zimbabwe, Masutu,</i>

24:13.706 --> 24:16.000
<i>Swaziland, Mozambique.</i>

24:16.183 --> 24:17.902
<i>Country after country.</i>

24:18.043 --> 24:20.145
<i>You don't have the capacity...</i>

24:20.328 --> 24:22.989
<i>Billions and billions of dollars short...</i>

24:31.440 --> 24:33.843
I have been free...

24:34.196 --> 24:36.630
of personal hygiene for almost a week.

24:37.162 --> 24:39.961
My teeth are knitting sweaters.
Not that you care.

24:44.831 --> 24:47.056
Well... I'll set up quantitative PCR

24:47.207 --> 24:48.930
and we can check the titers
in the morning.

24:49.082 --> 24:50.151
You sure?

24:50.585 --> 24:51.418
Yeah.

24:52.552 --> 24:54.414
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

24:56.056 --> 24:57.236
David...

24:59.600 --> 25:01.083
Why don't you sleep in?

25:01.734 --> 25:03.883
I'll come in early
and check the titer.

25:06.009 --> 25:07.401
Thanks, Jill.

25:13.521 --> 25:14.928
Goodnight boss.

25:15.125 --> 25:16.396
Goodnight.

25:20.054 --> 25:21.386
<i>Nothing...</i>

25:21.613 --> 25:23.928
<i>Nothing's really changed Carlos.</i>

25:24.034 --> 25:26.228
<i>You know, just try
to keep their sores clean</i>

25:26.398 --> 25:27.881
<i>and give them an aspirin.</i>

25:29.258 --> 25:32.405
After all those promises,
still not enough HIV drugs.

25:34.607 --> 25:38.224
<i>So did Sean say that he got HIV
from a needle stick?</i>

25:38.364 --> 25:40.361
All he said was it's a new strain.

25:41.148 --> 25:42.347
<i>Right, another one.</i>

25:42.483 --> 25:46.266
And now a woman and her baby
halfway across the world are at risk.

25:46.603 --> 25:49.149
Chuck, we're trying
to trace back the strain,

25:49.331 --> 25:51.828
back before Sean to patient zero.

25:52.062 --> 25:54.514
Sean mentioned he was
in Mizuzu three months ago.

25:54.665 --> 25:58.176
<i>Yeah, yeah he came down to
my orphanage right after that.</i>

25:58.420 --> 26:00.675
<i>He only... He only stayed
for a month though.</i>

26:00.796 --> 26:03.594
When he left your clinic,
did he say where he was going?

26:06.314 --> 26:07.212
<i>So...</i>

26:07.561 --> 26:10.531
Carlos, how did you know...

26:11.215 --> 26:13.345
<i>that Sean was working with me
here in South Africa?</i>

26:13.512 --> 26:15.036
He had the pendant.

26:16.318 --> 26:17.413
<i>You still got yours?</i>

26:18.664 --> 26:22.831
You ever miss hands on medicine?

26:23.702 --> 26:25.360
Some days yes.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.132
<i>Doing better now, huh?</i>

26:28.771 --> 26:29.744
Mostly.

26:52.392 --> 26:53.776
Oh God.

27:11.142 --> 27:13.013
<i>Dear David, I concur.
You need time off.</i>

27:13.150 --> 27:15.248
<i>Hope it'll be fun. See you in a week.
-- BOB</i>

27:15.355 --> 27:16.313
Oh Bob.

27:17.895 --> 27:19.005
Shit!

27:43.902 --> 27:44.845
What?

27:44.997 --> 27:47.555
We found three different
strains in the blood we tested.

27:47.692 --> 27:49.310
Oh, did we screw up?

27:49.385 --> 27:52.854
Impossible, we're not working with
any other strains of HIV except this one.

27:53.006 --> 27:54.162
Why the anomalies?

27:54.283 --> 27:56.220
How much closer
are we to finding patient zero?

27:56.326 --> 27:58.248
Maybe a comparison of his blood
can help us out.

27:58.566 --> 27:59.748
Okay, we're working on it.

27:59.854 --> 28:02.989
Okay, get Mayko to check
the sequence against the HIV database.

28:03.141 --> 28:04.291
I'll be right in.

28:25.348 --> 28:27.293
Okay, well it matches
nothing in the database.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.918
So what he said is true:
a new strain of HIV.

28:30.058 --> 28:32.606
- Can you generate protein structures?
- Yeah, already did.

28:33.040 --> 28:35.779
- What are we looking at?
- Okay so these are the structures

28:35.915 --> 28:38.352
for the three HIV proteins that
drugs know how to fight.

28:38.503 --> 28:40.423
Target it here, here and here.

28:41.844 --> 28:43.806
The drugs basically know
how to see these pockets

28:43.928 --> 28:45.875
- and they click into them.
- Right, they hinder

28:45.997 --> 28:48.178
HIV replication,
but what about Audrey's strain?

28:48.467 --> 28:51.889
Okay, so... this is the new
reverse transcriptase.

28:52.045 --> 28:53.459
This is what Audrey has.

28:53.839 --> 28:55.451
Sneaky little mutant.

28:55.714 --> 28:57.919
The drugs come across this,
they just stroll on by,

28:58.010 --> 29:00.383
they can't see any pockets
so they don't know where to target.

29:00.581 --> 29:02.512
So the antiretrovirals
Audrey's been taking...

29:02.695 --> 29:05.048
She may as well be on
massive doses of macaroni and cheese

29:05.154 --> 29:06.515
for all the good
they're doing her.

29:09.022 --> 29:10.802
So the drugs I'm taking
aren't helping me at all?

29:09.878 --> 29:12.106
No, your HIV is still replicating.

29:12.684 --> 29:16.152
Viruses mutate and a drug resistant
strain surfaces from time to time.

29:16.304 --> 29:18.433
It's what happens when someone
begins a drug regime

29:18.631 --> 29:20.444
and then does not complete it.

29:21.968 --> 29:24.219
The virus gets wise and evolves.

29:24.420 --> 29:26.279
It's what we call
an escape mutant.

29:26.553 --> 29:29.215
So a new virus,
make a new cocktail.

29:29.310 --> 29:30.892
It's not that simple.

29:31.041 --> 29:33.611
We've compared the protein
structure of your particular strain

29:33.815 --> 29:35.527
with every available HIV drug.

29:35.679 --> 29:38.178
It's predicted
to be resistant to all of them.

29:41.793 --> 29:42.979
All of them?

29:45.542 --> 29:47.535
I want to explore other options.

29:47.763 --> 29:49.850
- Like what?
- Inhibitory RNA.

29:50.428 --> 29:52.405
I want this disease out of me.

29:52.759 --> 29:54.668
Miss Graves... You'd be asking us to...

29:54.805 --> 29:57.740
silence the gene that allows
the virus into the cell. That could

29:57.862 --> 29:59.896
prevent other things from getting
into the cell,

30:00.032 --> 30:01.436
things that you need.
You wouldn't survive the treatment.

30:01.561 --> 30:04.358
But there are some biotech companies
already experimenting with RNAis,

30:04.465 --> 30:06.112
- why can't you do it?
- RNAis would need

30:07.393 --> 30:10.253
weeks of preparation and
three to five years of testing

30:10.359 --> 30:11.916
before we could even
dream of giving it to you.

30:12.179 --> 30:13.287
If we did try it right now

30:13.423 --> 30:15.557
the RNAi might target other genes

30:15.678 --> 30:17.831
say silence the gene
that tells your heart to beat.

30:17.925 --> 30:20.604
- It's just not ready for human trials.
- So stem cells.

30:22.832 --> 30:25.102
We are still years away from that option.

30:35.589 --> 30:37.011
So what then?

30:37.177 --> 30:38.997
Should I just get on a plane

30:39.118 --> 30:41.452
to a lab that will
do something for me?

30:44.652 --> 30:46.453
There's...

30:46.786 --> 30:48.602
There's personalized medicine.

30:48.893 --> 30:52.937
I mean there are drugs out there in clinical
trials right now doing amazing things.

30:53.058 --> 30:56.028
Some of them even stop
the virus before they get into your cells.

30:56.607 --> 30:58.877
They're just not available to the public.

30:59.879 --> 31:01.650
I bet they'd be
available to you though.

31:05.498 --> 31:06.512
Well then what?

31:07.046 --> 31:10.072
Then we collect
every HIV drug on the planet

31:10.239 --> 31:11.985
and we mix, match, test,

31:12.182 --> 31:14.593
Maybe within a few days come up
with the perfect cocktail for you.

31:15.319 --> 31:17.362
But you have to get us those drugs.

31:27.290 --> 31:30.601
Wes, I need you to track down
the cell line that best replicates HIV.

31:30.707 --> 31:31.947
Virology at Toronto Hospital?

31:32.023 --> 31:34.738
ASAP. I want them to start
infecting cells and culture today.

31:38.792 --> 31:40.560
- Simon?
- Mayko Tran!

31:42.518 --> 31:44.834
- Finally.
- Yeah, how are you? How was your flight?

31:44.986 --> 31:46.385
Quite long,
yeah good, good.

31:46.526 --> 31:50.206
- Good. David, come meet someone.
- All right, Simon Jessup.

31:52.305 --> 31:54.389
So you're the neuroscientist, eh?

31:54.661 --> 31:57.247
Awfully jet-lagged but here to assist.

31:57.459 --> 31:58.996
- Well, David Sandstrom.
- All right.

31:59.102 --> 32:01.170
- Is Caroline around?
- No, she left with Audrey.

32:02.193 --> 32:04.478
Okay, so do you guys want to
go grab a beer and talk

32:04.640 --> 32:06.560
- about what we're gonna try to do?
- Yeah, maybe you should...

32:06.640 --> 32:08.969
do you think you can prove
this whole I.Q. spike thing?

32:09.075 --> 32:12.532
If they're there I can locate,
verify and quantify, yeah.

32:12.703 --> 32:14.710
Why didn't anybody think
about this in the U.K.?

32:14.771 --> 32:16.719
Well your scientists here
thought to look for

32:16.840 --> 32:18.703
something good,
not just something bad.

32:19.037 --> 32:20.437
I think Dr. Tran is brilliant.

32:22.064 --> 32:24.045
What? I mean yes, yes she is.

32:24.181 --> 32:25.881
Excuse me for a second.

32:26.980 --> 32:28.003
Bob...

32:28.703 --> 32:30.558
Can I see you in my office please?

32:35.959 --> 32:37.313
A watch...

32:38.081 --> 32:40.036
from China.
I saw it and I thought,

32:40.173 --> 32:41.625
"Bob needs a watch".

32:43.232 --> 32:45.017
Thank you
but I already have a watch.

32:45.157 --> 32:46.096
Bob...

32:50.191 --> 32:51.484
Have a seat.

32:52.518 --> 32:54.100
Have a seat, Bob.

33:06.236 --> 33:07.849
I got your note.

33:08.145 --> 33:09.042
Oh.

33:15.174 --> 33:19.310
"Dear David, I concur,
you need time off.

33:20.120 --> 33:21.767
Hope it'll be fun.

33:22.555 --> 33:24.322
See you in a week.

33:24.672 --> 33:25.797
Bob."

33:27.913 --> 33:30.833
Did you know that there's a big cloud
of pollution over Asia right now?

33:30.894 --> 33:33.327
It's over three kilometres thick.
It's true.

33:33.498 --> 33:36.814
It's called the Asian brown cloud.
It could kill millions.

33:37.122 --> 33:40.316
Yeah, it goes all the way from
Sri Lanka to Afghanistan,

33:40.483 --> 33:41.688
Bangladesh, Nepal.

33:41.799 --> 33:44.521
- It's huge and it's growing.
- Are you mad at me Bob?

33:48.231 --> 33:49.965
- Yes.
- Why?

33:51.125 --> 33:53.315
You... left me.

33:54.170 --> 33:55.782
I left everything Bob.

33:56.258 --> 33:58.738
But I thought you understood
and I thought you'd be coming back,

33:58.844 --> 34:00.881
and every day I would open the door
and it wasn't you,

34:00.976 --> 34:02.497
and it opened again and it wasn't you.

34:02.619 --> 34:04.292
And you didn't come back,
and you didn't come back,

34:04.433 --> 34:05.908
and you didn't come back,
and you didn't...

34:08.597 --> 34:10.193
I'm sorry.

34:16.157 --> 34:18.089
Just don't do it again.

34:20.659 --> 34:21.885
I won't.

34:29.187 --> 34:30.666
It's a very nice watch, David.

34:32.822 --> 34:33.791
Thank you.

34:36.139 --> 34:38.368
So what was Carlisle like?

34:39.306 --> 34:42.155
Rolling hills,
pubs on every corner,

34:42.371 --> 34:45.186
- I could see Scotland from the garden.
- Hmm, it sounds lovely.

34:45.310 --> 34:48.125
Yeah, if you like wet,
miserable boredom.

34:50.891 --> 34:54.522
As soon as I turned 15,
I left the farm, moved down to London.

34:54.636 --> 34:55.679
What did you do there?

34:55.786 --> 34:57.360
I was in a band.

34:57.757 --> 35:00.072
I didn't go back to school
until I was 23,

35:00.969 --> 35:02.486
and now I'm Professor Jessup.

35:04.952 --> 35:06.742
Are you ready?
We're gonna turn this on.

35:06.878 --> 35:07.847
About time.

35:10.272 --> 35:11.074
Okay...

35:12.541 --> 35:14.478
- I want you to play close attention.
- Okay.

35:19.771 --> 35:20.876
- All right?
- Okay.

35:23.607 --> 35:26.603
You know... You don't look
like you grew up on a farm.

35:27.103 --> 35:29.679
Okay Mayko Tran, watch this.

35:31.666 --> 35:33.557
This is what's inside your head.

35:34.231 --> 35:36.909
Now watch what your temporal
lobe does when I....

35:37.499 --> 35:39.285
- Fuck.
- Right, cool huh?

35:40.227 --> 35:42.164
- Yes.
- Yes. And...

35:47.194 --> 35:49.298
- And if I may.
- Okay.

35:51.753 --> 35:53.115
Right, nice.

35:53.281 --> 35:54.568
Look, look.

35:54.931 --> 35:58.173
Sound, sight and touch.
You respond very nicely to each.

35:59.539 --> 36:03.038
Okay, well thank you. I have been
a functioning human being my entire life,

36:03.160 --> 36:05.202
except for that year
that I had mono, that sucked.

36:05.339 --> 36:07.118
Quick, the five things
I asked you to remember.

36:07.301 --> 36:10.160
A goat, a starry night, a wizard's cap,
the Eiffel tower and Pi AB.

36:10.711 --> 36:12.552
- Pi what?
- Area of an ellipse...

36:12.820 --> 36:14.190
- Farm boy!
- Farm boy.

36:15.420 --> 36:16.763
Boy, you're in trouble now.

36:17.871 --> 36:19.194
Sean McPherson.

36:20.000 --> 36:20.624
Yes.

36:20.822 --> 36:21.719
He was?

36:24.074 --> 36:24.895
That's great.

36:28.199 --> 36:32.169
As I understand it, he was on a
UNICEF jeep heading out of Serowe.

36:32.416 --> 36:33.709
He was there?

36:35.465 --> 36:36.378
Yeah...

36:37.944 --> 36:40.910
Can you... no, can you tell me
where they got the medical supplies?

36:42.203 --> 36:43.265
Okay.

36:43.873 --> 36:45.561
No, thank you very much.

36:46.523 --> 36:49.063
<i>I haven't heard from him
since he left South Africa.</i>

36:50.422 --> 36:53.987
This strain has 10,000 times
more virus per millilitre

36:54.139 --> 36:56.695
<i>- than anything I've ever since before.
- 10,000?</i>

36:58.470 --> 37:01.148
Have you heard anyone
talk about something like that?

37:01.772 --> 37:03.149
<i>No, not at all.</i>

37:04.847 --> 37:06.466
<i>So what are you gonna do now?</i>

37:06.939 --> 37:08.861
I'm trying to find a cocktail
that would fight it

37:08.952 --> 37:12.886
and still trace Sean
back to patient zero, but...

37:13.102 --> 37:16.022
If there's anything new you can give me,
don't hesitate to call.

37:16.192 --> 37:18.553
<i>Yeah, absolutely,
and I will ask around,</i>

37:19.162 --> 37:21.002
<i>see if anyone knows anything.</i>

37:22.025 --> 37:23.211
Thank you my friend.

37:33.411 --> 37:35.449
- Anything?
- No.

37:35.875 --> 37:37.627
The kid moved around a lot.

37:37.779 --> 37:40.928
He was at a clinic at Kasama,
Zambia about a month ago.

37:41.038 --> 37:42.574
He wasn't sick when he was there,

37:42.696 --> 37:45.300
and they have never ever seen
the strain that we found.

37:45.715 --> 37:47.722
Do they know
where he went when he left?

37:47.798 --> 37:48.848
No.

37:51.270 --> 37:52.745
So we lost him.

37:53.996 --> 37:55.426
Shit.

38:04.068 --> 38:05.543
- David.
- What's the matter?

38:05.680 --> 38:07.764
We've been infecting the cells...
The cells, and the...

38:07.930 --> 38:09.629
- The culture... the...
- Bob. Bob.

38:12.674 --> 38:15.069
We've been infecting the cells in culture
with Audrey's HIV.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.067
Yeah.

38:17.327 --> 38:18.596
Bob, what's the matter?

38:19.011 --> 38:20.524
Just... would you just wait.

38:20.630 --> 38:22.189
Stop for one second.

38:22.325 --> 38:23.898
What the hell is wrong with you?

38:24.674 --> 38:26.898
She's sitting in
the hospital David,

38:26.993 --> 38:30.867
she's six months pregnant
and she has no one.

38:33.824 --> 38:36.022
And now you're telling me
the baby's at risk?

38:36.113 --> 38:39.124
No, I'm telling you she needs
to have her baby out right away.

38:39.245 --> 38:41.897
Well what happened? You said
the baby's protected in the womb,

38:42.064 --> 38:44.371
that the disease
doesn't cross the placenta.

38:44.553 --> 38:46.611
What I was trying to explain to you
is that this strain is so virulent

38:46.717 --> 38:49.577
Audrey could progress to full blown AIDS
before the fetus is full term, okay?

38:49.732 --> 38:53.231
Which means the baby's chances of contracting
HIV perinatally, have increased too.

38:56.099 --> 38:58.006
He's too young to be born.

38:59.019 --> 39:00.790
- How many weeks gestation?
- Twenty-six.

39:01.278 --> 39:03.745
Caroline, he'll be tiny yes.

39:03.945 --> 39:06.608
And he'll be weak, no question,
but he'll have a chance.

39:07.460 --> 39:09.306
At this point his only chance.

39:16.012 --> 39:18.689
Sean's dad just sent us these pictures.

39:21.932 --> 39:24.122
These could be anywhere in Africa.

39:25.647 --> 39:28.373
- So we're no further ahead?
- Hey, how's it going?

39:28.484 --> 39:30.704
We contacted lots of
different places on the continent.

39:30.826 --> 39:32.849
We cannot find one single clinic
that treated Sean

39:33.050 --> 39:35.119
or anybody else with this strain of HIV.

39:35.229 --> 39:37.191
Do you know if patient zero
is male or female?

39:37.773 --> 39:38.655
I don't know.

39:38.883 --> 39:40.434
- Was Sean a nurse?
- A volunteer.

39:40.599 --> 39:41.877
Okay, so he didn't touch needles.

39:41.983 --> 39:43.991
My bet is he got HIV from sex.
Was he gay or straight?

39:44.970 --> 39:46.982
- I don't know.
- Ask his parents.

39:49.948 --> 39:51.195
How are you doing?

39:51.780 --> 39:53.860
I've started a personalized medicine.

39:53.982 --> 39:56.583
We're prepping Audrey
for a bloodless C-section tonight.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.773
I'm just really scared.

40:02.660 --> 40:05.624
Oh, to  you and the baby,
it's gonna be okay.

40:09.712 --> 40:11.506
All right. We all set?

40:12.054 --> 40:13.545
What do you say?

40:26.319 --> 40:27.778
Can you stay with me?

40:32.435 --> 40:33.410
Sure.

40:51.118 --> 40:53.630
So we sorted and
combined and recombined

40:53.781 --> 40:57.352
all of the available drugs commonly used
for HIV and all the ones in clinical trials,

40:57.477 --> 40:59.720
- and we end up with this.
- 141 combinations,

40:59.811 --> 41:02.051
282 if you count the duplicates.

41:02.176 --> 41:03.342
Good. Okay.

41:03.744 --> 41:05.533
- Let's do drugs.
- Okay.

41:06.197 --> 41:08.951
Bob... Now it is.

41:42.766 --> 41:44.218
What's the smoke for?

41:44.358 --> 41:46.477
They're cauterizing blood
vessels as they go,

41:46.583 --> 41:49.095
making sure your blood doesn't
contact the baby on his way out.

41:50.920 --> 41:53.539
- What's happening?
- He's almost here Audrey.

41:56.023 --> 41:58.238
So why did you decide
to name him Richard?

41:58.384 --> 42:00.521
- Is it after somebody?
- Tissue clamp.

42:01.561 --> 42:04.709
- My father was Richard.
- Yeah?

42:05.242 --> 42:08.556
Your father had a good name.
Where did you grow up?

42:09.589 --> 42:10.603
Audrey, look at me.

42:11.711 --> 42:13.542
Where did you grow up?

42:16.411 --> 42:19.195
All over the world.
I was an army brat.

42:19.320 --> 42:22.074
Yeah? Me too,
I grew up all over the world.

42:22.225 --> 42:25.074
No army though, I was just
your average annoying brat.

42:25.214 --> 42:27.287
There we go, we got you.

42:28.290 --> 42:30.787
Just a little bleeding,
they're getting it under control now.

42:32.213 --> 42:33.548
Why isn't he crying?

42:33.775 --> 42:36.408
He's too small to cry:
underdeveloped lungs.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.300
I want to see him.

42:38.440 --> 42:41.043
You will. They need
to run some tests first.

42:41.167 --> 42:42.484
I need to hold him.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.965
I need to hold him!

42:48.113 --> 42:50.470
A hundred and forty fucking flasks.

42:50.657 --> 42:53.303
- A hundred and forty-one.
- Not a single goddamn taker.

42:53.840 --> 42:56.295
Well there's one that slows the virus down
a little more than the others.

42:56.406 --> 42:58.588
But not enough to stop it from replicating.

42:58.744 --> 43:00.569
- What drugs are in it?
- It doesn't matter.

43:00.691 --> 43:02.668
***-457 Tenofovir.

43:06.541 --> 43:10.298
All this work and the best we can come up
is something that has no effect at all.

43:18.629 --> 43:19.769
Thank you.

43:23.138 --> 43:24.887
I just talked to Sean's parents.

43:25.161 --> 43:27.321
If he was gay,
they weren't aware of it.

43:27.493 --> 43:29.788
Gay or straight in Africa
a vast majority of the cases

43:29.879 --> 43:32.328
are transmitted heterosexually.

43:32.748 --> 43:35.653
More than fifty percent
of the victims are women, so.

43:37.406 --> 43:39.231
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

43:40.013 --> 43:42.173
We need to find patient zero.

43:42.253 --> 43:45.486
If not we're going to a completely
untreatable strain on our hands.

43:46.864 --> 43:48.841
- The drug cocktail's not working?
- Nothing.

43:51.065 --> 43:52.353
How's the baby doing?

43:52.433 --> 43:54.210
I think we'll know more later.

43:58.433 --> 44:00.860
Two million Africans
die every year of AIDS.

44:01.073 --> 44:03.953
It's the worst plague
in human history and it's beating us.

44:05.354 --> 44:07.468
You know, the Pope thinks
that millions are dying in Africa

44:07.620 --> 44:09.415
because of a pathology of the spirit.

44:12.358 --> 44:15.491
He should try telling that
to 20,000 kids in Bulawayo.

44:22.633 --> 44:24.144
That's fucking sick.

44:26.475 --> 44:27.312
Yes it is.

44:27.540 --> 44:32.030
<i>There's no way I'm going home tonight</i>

44:32.953 --> 44:38.030
<i>I'm finding my way to your bed instead</i>

44:39.673 --> 44:45.233
<i>As the room spins below us</i>

44:45.313 --> 44:50.403
<i>I see the books that you said you'd read</i>

44:51.754 --> 44:53.893
Do you have
the results of the baby's test?

45:00.437 --> 45:01.893
What is it?

45:02.178 --> 45:03.891
Richard Grave's CD4 count.

45:04.542 --> 45:06.418
- Oh no.
- HIV.

45:07.573 --> 45:08.768
Oh shit.

45:10.293 --> 45:12.089
None? Not one?

45:12.150 --> 45:14.178
No, not that it would
have helped her anyway.

45:14.314 --> 45:15.434
What do you mean?

45:15.615 --> 45:18.118
I had a look at
the results of her blood tests.

45:18.243 --> 45:19.317
She's...

45:19.559 --> 45:22.389
She's progressed to infection.
She's HIV positive.

45:27.126 --> 45:28.730
And Richard,
what about him?

45:28.927 --> 45:31.681
<i>I can't sleep</i>

45:32.396 --> 45:38.710
<i>Turn up the dark</i>

45:38.973 --> 45:45.134
<i>I've seen so much that
I've seen it all before</i>

45:45.300 --> 45:51.213
<i>Turn up the dark</i>

45:51.293 --> 45:59.443
<i>I've seen so much that
I've seen it all before</i>

46:00.839 --> 46:09.276
<i>There are so many hours in our day </i>

46:13.237 --> 46:17.644
<i>And we fill it all with liquor</i>

46:18.037 --> 46:25.006
<i>And reading clever things to say</i>

46:35.492 --> 46:37.943
<i>Next on ReGenesis</i>

46:40.219 --> 46:42.353
You think can stop HIV with aspirin?

46:42.504 --> 46:44.748
- Maybe, maybe.
- It's crazy.

46:44.944 --> 46:46.961
We have to let the drugs
work for 12 hours.

46:47.067 --> 46:49.458
Bob, it's going 12 hours and
minus what, ten big fat minutes?

46:49.609 --> 46:50.895
I'm checking the dishes.

46:51.039 --> 46:54.686
Hello I'm Principal Oakley. I understand
you may have some good news for us.

46:54.826 --> 46:56.172
We'll know more when
we've done a few tests.

46:56.275 --> 46:59.638
- It helps if you wear a magic hat.
- An electroencephalogram helmet.

47:00.373 --> 47:02.683
Ruby ate all that infected chicken.

47:02.887 --> 47:05.138
We need answers, please.

47:05.309 --> 47:07.529
Does she have a previously
registered I.Q. increase?

47:07.655 --> 47:09.449
- Yeah.
- Exhume the body.

47:10.609 --> 47:13.484
So I should just throw
the dice with my son's life?

47:14.057 --> 47:15.435
With this strain of HIV,

47:15.529 --> 47:16.667
we have no time.

47:17.693 --> 47:20.902
- Carlos, what's going on?
- I have to go back to Africa, David.

47:21.993 --> 47:24.046
There are...
There are people dying there.

47:24.172 --> 47:26.027
They need me.

47:26.475 --> 47:29.441
