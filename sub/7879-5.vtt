11:06.157 --> 11:07.758
Oh, it's on the outside.

11:13.589 --> 11:14.982
(tires squealing)

11:18.594 --> 11:20.938
(whistling)

11:22.307 --> 11:23.808
What's gotten into you, Steve?

11:23.974 --> 11:26.152
Oh, Mother, it's the love bug,

11:26.277 --> 11:27.979
and I want to be sick forever.

11:28.145 --> 11:29.756
This must be <i>some</i> girl.

11:29.881 --> 11:32.192
Oh, she is. I'm gonna ask her

11:32.317 --> 11:33.192
to the homecoming dance.

11:33.358 --> 11:35.486
Homecoming! Oh, Steve!

11:35.770 --> 11:38.381
Does this little minx have a name?

11:38.506 --> 11:40.150
It's Chelsea.

11:40.275 --> 11:41.985
Chelsea?! What happened
to that other girl

11:42.110 --> 11:43.153
you were seeing, Phyllis?

11:43.278 --> 11:44.854
She was really enjoying
her time with you.

11:44.979 --> 11:46.122
Sure didn't seem like it.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.390
She wouldn't even kiss me.

11:47.515 --> 11:49.659
Nice girls don't kiss
on the first date, Steve.

11:49.784 --> 11:52.662
Your mom wouldn't kiss me
until our third date.

11:52.787 --> 11:55.965
It made the sex on the first
two dates very impersonal.

11:59.961 --> 12:01.738
Whoa, Kanye!

12:01.863 --> 12:04.007
What's with the big-time entrance?

12:04.132 --> 12:05.909
I'm about to ask Chelsea
to the dance.

12:06.034 --> 12:08.244
Thought I should arrive in style.

12:08.369 --> 12:10.571
If you boys'll excuse me.

12:12.157 --> 12:13.733
Hey, Steve.
Want to hang out?

12:14.025 --> 12:16.069
I got your favorite, meatball subs.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.613
Look, Phyllis,
I don't think it's gonna work out.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.365
Don't say that!
Why are you...

12:20.531 --> 12:21.574
... saying that?

12:21.699 --> 12:23.043
I'm sorry, I'm just...

12:23.168 --> 12:25.478
I'm looking for something
more than friendship.

12:25.603 --> 12:27.914
Uh, if you go to the dance with me,

12:28.039 --> 12:29.416
I'll have sex with you.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.041
Okay!

12:45.855 --> 12:47.256
This is sick, man!

12:47.381 --> 12:49.308
Are you really going to
go through with this?

12:49.433 --> 12:51.743
I've already missed so
much of Steve's life.

12:51.868 --> 12:54.012
This way,
I get to keep hanging out with him.

12:54.137 --> 12:56.131
Plus, I get to be there for his

12:56.256 --> 12:57.735
biggest milestone ever:
losing his virginity.

12:57.991 --> 12:59.701
To you, you idiot!

12:59.826 --> 13:01.614
Have you even thought this through?

13:01.780 --> 13:03.305
Look, fathers take their sons
to whorehouses

13:03.430 --> 13:05.324
to lose their virginity all the time.

13:05.449 --> 13:07.120
This is almost just like that.

13:07.286 --> 13:10.162
Except I will be locked
in eye contact with my son

13:10.287 --> 13:12.455
while he plows my cyber soil.

13:15.392 --> 13:17.469
STEVE: Hey, Mom,
can you teach me how to shave?

13:17.594 --> 13:20.889
Aah! I can't believe
your father's not here.

13:21.014 --> 13:22.541
I'm going down to the CIA

13:22.666 --> 13:25.067
to give him a piece of my mind.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.382
They got run over, man!

13:30.507 --> 13:31.600
They're dead!

13:31.725 --> 13:32.601
We're next, I know it.

13:32.726 --> 13:35.304
Bro, relax!
Go splash some water

13:35.429 --> 13:37.406
on your face and pull
yourself together, man.

13:37.531 --> 13:38.841
We're gonna be fine.

13:38.966 --> 13:41.033
Remember, we're Lanes AdAddiction.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.653
(engine idling nearby)

13:51.778 --> 13:53.612
(brakes screeching)

14:03.106 --> 14:05.007
Oh, thank God.

14:06.309 --> 14:08.244
(Dixie car horn playing,
engine revving)

14:17.856 --> 14:19.055
(techno music playing)

14:22.694 --> 14:24.906
(rap music plays)

14:25.072 --> 14:27.897
Oh, this is my ish!

14:56.676 --> 14:59.412
♪ ♪

15:03.568 --> 15:05.677
Come on, let's go get some privacy.

15:05.802 --> 15:07.279
Uh, right now?

15:07.404 --> 15:08.533
What's the hurry?

15:08.699 --> 15:11.233
I'm sorry, I'm just excited.

15:11.358 --> 15:12.818
I mean, this is gonna be

15:12.943 --> 15:14.705
the biggest moment of my life.

15:17.064 --> 15:21.504
(sighs) And I'm gonna finally
be there for it.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.069
(tires screeching)

15:25.422 --> 15:26.632
Stan, this is the last time

15:26.757 --> 15:28.834
you put work before Steve!

15:28.959 --> 15:31.389
He's actually with Steve right now.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.972
What? So Stan's at the dance?

15:34.097 --> 15:36.975
No, he's here, but he's
remotely controlling

15:37.100 --> 15:38.844
a teen girl at the dance

15:38.969 --> 15:41.279
who's about to get
sex-pummeled by your son.

15:41.404 --> 15:42.400
What?!

15:42.566 --> 15:44.277
It's a lot like <i>Avatar.</i>

15:44.443 --> 15:45.350
Like what?

15:45.475 --> 15:48.920
<i>Avatar.</i>
It's a movie?

15:49.045 --> 15:53.925
Okay, okay, so there's
this guy in a wheelchair,

15:54.050 --> 15:55.594
and he goes to this alien planet

15:55.719 --> 15:57.179
to join a program...

15:57.304 --> 16:01.500
So you pick a dragon and get
to keep it forever?

16:01.625 --> 16:03.735
No, it picks <i>you.</i>

16:03.860 --> 16:06.738
Wait! Stan's about
to use an avatar's body

16:06.863 --> 16:08.924
to take Steve's virginity?

16:09.049 --> 16:11.510
Stan, get out of there!

16:11.635 --> 16:13.462
He can't hear you in there.

16:13.587 --> 16:15.998
That's impenetrable glass.
You'll never get in.

16:16.123 --> 16:18.667
Fine, I'll just go to the dance
and kick the crap

16:18.792 --> 16:20.185
out of that girl he's controlling!

16:20.310 --> 16:21.420
Careful, Francine!

16:21.545 --> 16:24.046
These avatars have
superhuman strength.

16:33.306 --> 16:35.751
(hushed): Let's make a baby.

16:35.876 --> 16:37.877
Yeah, sexy talk.

16:40.457 --> 16:41.773
Let me just go to the washroom,

16:41.898 --> 16:43.108
cut a couple anxiety farts

16:43.233 --> 16:45.711
and then come back
here and go to town

16:45.836 --> 16:47.796
on your continental divide.

16:47.921 --> 16:48.954
(snaps fingers)

16:55.263 --> 16:57.622
Okay, okay, stop freaking out.

16:57.747 --> 16:59.141
You can do this.

16:59.266 --> 17:01.009
Pictured it a million times
in your head.

17:01.134 --> 17:02.594
Oh! Oh, God!

17:02.719 --> 17:04.329
I just pictured it again!

17:04.454 --> 17:07.857
Oh, oh... (sighs)

17:20.704 --> 17:22.954
Get away from him, you bitch!

17:30.382 --> 17:32.507
I can't believe you'd do this, Stan!

17:32.632 --> 17:33.732
This stops now!

17:44.794 --> 17:46.816
Get out of here, Francine.

17:46.982 --> 17:49.982
This is the only way I can
remain close to Steve.

17:53.989 --> 17:54.820
(grunts)

17:55.638 --> 17:56.622
(metallic clang)

17:58.258 --> 18:01.372
We were finally spending
quality time together.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.405
And then he was gonna dump me
for that nerd,

18:03.530 --> 18:05.948
and I just won't lose him again!

18:08.795 --> 18:12.297
Must... get plowed...

18:12.422 --> 18:14.093
by son.

18:14.259 --> 18:17.419
No, Stan, this isn't the way!

18:17.544 --> 18:20.021
You might've missed
his first 14 years,

18:20.146 --> 18:23.269
but you can still be there
for his next 14.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.855
He's gonna die at 28?

18:26.021 --> 18:27.696
Maybe.
Maybe sooner.

18:27.821 --> 18:31.483
Look, I know you want
to be closer to Steve,

18:31.608 --> 18:34.476
but all you can do is be there
for him.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.747
Wha... what happened?

18:42.913 --> 18:46.865
Steve, you're a terrific kid,

18:46.990 --> 18:50.379
but I'm not right for you.

18:50.545 --> 18:54.406
Besides, there's a homely,
kinky-haired beauty out there

18:54.531 --> 18:57.428
who'd just love to dance
with you right now.

18:57.594 --> 18:59.244
Snot wants to dance with me?

18:59.369 --> 19:02.981
Oh, wait, Chelsea, got it,
got it, got it.

19:03.106 --> 19:04.310
I'm gonna go get her back!

19:04.476 --> 19:06.551
Hey, Steve.
Yeah?

19:06.676 --> 19:08.253
Your dad, he loves you.

19:08.378 --> 19:10.455
I'm sorry, are you...?

19:10.580 --> 19:12.257
Have you been spending
time with my dad?

19:12.382 --> 19:13.291
No!

19:13.416 --> 19:15.026
Is that where he's been?

19:15.151 --> 19:16.822
Is that why he's gone all the time?

19:17.053 --> 19:18.296
What?

19:18.421 --> 19:21.032
Are you... are you banging my dad?!

19:21.157 --> 19:23.568
Hey! Whoa!
Come on!

19:23.693 --> 19:25.370
(sighs) Okay, good.

19:25.495 --> 19:27.339
'Cause you could do better.

19:27.464 --> 19:28.473
A <i>lot</i> better.

19:28.598 --> 19:29.999
See ya!

19:31.251 --> 19:33.085
(Bleep) you, Steve.

19:41.888 --> 19:43.879
(sighs)

19:49.562 --> 19:52.754
(car engine revving, tires
squealing, Dixie horn playing)

19:54.734 --> 19:55.650
(screaming)

19:55.775 --> 19:56.862
(loud thud)

19:57.028 --> 19:58.560
(explosion)

20:02.742 --> 20:04.475
Roger, you got your revenge.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.285
Can we go home now?

20:07.570 --> 20:08.496
(screams)

20:08.621 --> 20:09.583
Roger!

20:09.749 --> 20:11.649
I'm sorry, I got the blood lust!

20:11.774 --> 20:13.087
Eventually I'll get bored with it.

20:13.253 --> 20:14.986
Remember when I was
super into Jiffy Pop?

20:15.111 --> 20:17.672
Had it all the time
for a snack? Overdid it.

20:17.797 --> 20:19.507
Then I started having
a little Greek yogurt

20:19.632 --> 20:21.960
and berries at night.
That's all I need.

20:22.085 --> 20:23.878
Hey, so what's happening
with that girl?

20:24.003 --> 20:25.599
You still e-mailing with...?

20:29.436 --> 20:31.586
You did the right thing, Stan.

20:31.711 --> 20:35.040
I know, I'm just gonna miss
being close with him.

20:35.165 --> 20:36.908
Hey, honey, how'd the dance go?

20:37.033 --> 20:39.044
Ah, turns out Chelsea didn't like

20:39.169 --> 20:40.946
that I went to the
dance with Phyllis.

20:41.071 --> 20:42.447
She's got way more pride

20:42.572 --> 20:44.076
than her physical appearance
would suggest.

20:44.242 --> 20:45.033
(sobbing)

20:45.158 --> 20:47.335
Th-There.
There, there.

20:47.460 --> 20:50.755
Anyway, I'm gonna go hit the sack.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.191
Then probably go to bed.

20:53.316 --> 20:54.149
Good night.

20:56.219 --> 20:59.047
Thanks for listening, Dad.

20:59.172 --> 21:00.815
Did you see that?

21:00.940 --> 21:02.417
I was there for him!

21:02.542 --> 21:04.319
I was there to help him through

21:04.444 --> 21:06.187
this terrible moment in his life.

21:06.312 --> 21:08.490
But you caused that terrible moment!

21:08.615 --> 21:12.084
Yup. Everything worked out
for everybody in the end.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.102
Is this your smallest condom?

21:35.227 --> 21:36.386
Nothing tinier?

21:36.511 --> 21:38.922
Would they shrink
if I put them in the dryer?

21:39.047 --> 21:40.524
I don't know, man.

21:40.649 --> 21:42.635
Ah, this is tough.

21:42.851 --> 21:45.304
All right, I'll try 'em.
