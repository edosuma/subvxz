00:00.850 --> 00:01.950
Two new cases.

00:01.990 --> 00:04.220
Nora's a widow. 80.
Acute renal failure.

00:04.250 --> 00:06.050
She's choosing
not to do dialysis.

00:06.090 --> 00:07.920
<i>Joel has
an inoperable brain tumor.</i>

00:07.960 --> 00:09.760
<i>I gave them both your number.</i>

00:09.790 --> 00:11.190
Joel?

00:12.630 --> 00:14.460
You had sex with our target.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.360
We arrest her. End of story.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.530
Is this your mom's?
She's not a drug dealer.

00:18.570 --> 00:19.700
She's a doctor.

00:19.740 --> 00:21.500
<i>- Naomi collapsed onstage.</i>

00:21.540 --> 00:22.770
Honey, what did you take?

00:22.810 --> 00:24.670
That stuff that was
in your shed.

00:24.710 --> 00:26.110
Please don't tell my mom.

00:26.140 --> 00:27.480
I fainted.

00:27.510 --> 00:28.740
I think Naomiâ€™s lying.

00:28.780 --> 00:30.056
These bottles.
They were right here.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.210
It's for Casper.
He needs to be put down.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.580
I need more pento.

00:33.620 --> 00:34.996
Wanted to make sure
that you were using

00:35.020 --> 00:36.066
And that you weren't selling.

00:36.090 --> 00:39.150
I, troy Dixon,
choose to take my life.

00:39.190 --> 00:41.220
Pentobarbital with champagne.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074

00:51.100 --> 00:52.300
Okay, ladies, let's see this.

00:52.340 --> 00:54.200
And up, down.

00:54.240 --> 00:55.800
And up.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.270
And four,

00:57.310 --> 01:00.310
Three, two, one.

01:00.340 --> 01:02.010
Let's just twist. Whoo!

01:03.610 --> 01:06.480
Twist it out! Come on!

01:08.890 --> 01:11.250
Shake 'em!

01:11.290 --> 01:13.490
Whoo! Here we go!

01:40.150 --> 01:42.780
Legs feeling better, Nora? Much.

01:42.820 --> 01:44.590
The swelling's gone down.

01:44.620 --> 01:47.360
Oh, the water always helps.

01:47.390 --> 01:49.320
Well, see you next Friday.

01:51.460 --> 01:53.430
Good-bye, Edith.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.580
Edward and I used to come here
every weekend.

02:12.620 --> 02:15.150
We'd sit here
just where you two are right now

02:15.190 --> 02:17.150
And watch the birds.

02:17.190 --> 02:19.620
How was your swim, Nora?
Oh, it was lovely,

02:19.660 --> 02:23.620
Just to be in the water
one last time.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.790
And thank you
for accommodating me,

02:25.830 --> 02:27.460
Meeting me here.

02:27.500 --> 02:32.970
I know it's a risk, but this is
such a beautiful place to die.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.940
A little risk makes life
exciting, doesn't it?

02:37.470 --> 02:39.040
Do you have any questions
or concerns?

02:39.080 --> 02:40.270
Anything on your mind?

02:40.310 --> 02:42.140
You've been wonderful.

02:42.180 --> 02:45.110
I'm just happy
to have this choice.

02:52.420 --> 02:55.020
Edward was a scientist.

02:55.060 --> 02:57.330
He always used to tell me,

02:57.360 --> 03:01.960
Energy is not created
or destroyed.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.230
It just is.

03:06.270 --> 03:09.770
I believe every bit of him is
still around,

03:09.810 --> 03:11.770
Just in a different form.

03:14.710 --> 03:16.140
That's beautiful.

03:16.180 --> 03:17.810
It's true.

04:00.460 --> 04:01.920
She's gone.

04:03.260 --> 04:04.930
I'm sure.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.890
Never gonna let it go, are you?

04:11.100 --> 04:13.630
See? This is how it should be.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.000
Say good-bye when you're ready
in a place you love.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.970
It should be, but it's not,
so let's skedaddle.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.110
Someone will find her, right?

04:22.150 --> 04:23.950
Oh, god, yeah.
One hour, this place will be

04:23.980 --> 04:25.250
Swarming with people.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.810
Oh, she left us a tip.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.580
$5 each. Classic grandma.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.320
Aww.

04:30.350 --> 04:31.550
What about Joel?

04:31.590 --> 04:34.220
What about him? Oh, come on.

04:35.690 --> 04:38.660
I was reviewing the journals
on GBM tumors last night,

04:38.700 --> 04:40.600
And there are several
new treatment options.

04:40.630 --> 04:42.160
Oh, my god,
you had sex with him,

04:42.200 --> 04:44.406
And now you think you two are
gonna live happily ever after.

04:44.430 --> 04:46.700
He's dying.
And you are such a woman.

04:46.740 --> 04:48.170
I'm not a woman. I'm a doctor.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.500
I'm doing my due diligence.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.670
Yeah, you are,
duly and diligently.

05:15.060 --> 05:16.300
Mary.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.330
Hi.

05:21.470 --> 05:23.340
Hey.

05:28.650 --> 05:30.240
Do you want anything?

05:30.280 --> 05:32.750
The coffee here is... it's bad.

05:32.780 --> 05:34.220
It's very bad.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.080
I'm used to bad coffee.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.590
You know, hospitals and all.

05:41.820 --> 05:44.860
I used to work in a place like
this when I was in med school.

05:44.890 --> 05:47.560
<i>Covered my coffee,
covered my rent.</i>

05:47.600 --> 05:50.500
<i>- Really?
So no help from mom and dad?</i>

05:52.740 --> 05:54.240
No mom, no dad.

05:57.170 --> 06:00.510
I'm sorry it took me a couple
days to get back to you.

06:00.540 --> 06:02.980
But I still want to help.

06:03.010 --> 06:04.950
Great.
I mean, that... that is great.

06:07.780 --> 06:11.750
So, as you know,
glioblastoma progresses quickly.

06:11.790 --> 06:15.190
Everything looks fine,
and then you get one bad cell.

06:15.220 --> 06:17.160
And then it multiplies,
and it multiplies...

06:17.190 --> 06:21.000
And it multiplies, yeah.
So, why are you telling me this?

06:22.730 --> 06:25.500
Joel, the thing is,
people are working on it.

06:25.540 --> 06:28.100
It's actually quite exciting.

06:28.140 --> 06:31.540
And a friend of mine is doing
a clinical trial next month.

06:31.570 --> 06:34.280
He's looking for candidates.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.880
You're serious?

06:35.910 --> 06:37.140
Yeah.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.300
Jesus.
Now she's trying to save me.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.500
Just roll with me, okay?
I'm gonna break her.

06:56.530 --> 06:57.770
Joel, wait!

07:01.500 --> 07:04.710
You'd be perfect
for one of these trials.

07:04.740 --> 07:06.086
I mean, you're young.
You're strong.

07:06.110 --> 07:09.040
You know, I've had
so much chemo and radiation...

07:09.080 --> 07:11.980
Enough to kill everything
inside of me except the tumor...

07:12.010 --> 07:13.380
In my brain, which is probably

07:13.420 --> 07:15.180
The only part of me
I ever really liked.

07:15.220 --> 07:16.850
I'm only trying to help you.

07:16.890 --> 07:19.650
You really think
there's something to fix, Mary?

07:19.690 --> 07:22.420
There's nothing to fix, okay?
I'm dying.

07:22.460 --> 07:26.090
So, this... this whole thing
you're doing, it's...

07:26.130 --> 07:27.430
It's mean.

07:31.470 --> 07:32.900
Joel.

07:55.260 --> 07:56.890
I need to ask you something,
mom.

07:58.030 --> 08:01.030
What is it, love?

08:01.060 --> 08:03.260
Can you make me
a grilled cheese sandwich?

08:03.300 --> 08:04.600
'cause I'm really hungry.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.940
You little.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.770
How you doing, Yvonne?

08:19.120 --> 08:22.680
No more hospitals.
No more treatments.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.080
No more.

08:24.120 --> 08:27.050
I want to... I want to go home.

08:29.530 --> 08:30.760
Okay.

08:32.960 --> 08:37.570
I'll speak to the doctor today
and try and get you discharged.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.400
I can connect you with
the hospital's palliative care.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.070
No.

08:46.110 --> 08:49.040
Charlie, no.

08:50.980 --> 08:53.080
Charlie, what is it?

08:55.790 --> 08:58.020
My mom wants to know

08:58.050 --> 09:00.650
How much morphine
it would take to...

09:06.700 --> 09:09.730
I'm sorry.

09:09.770 --> 09:11.700
I can't tell you that.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.240
I have someone
that I can refer you to.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.410
An independent
end-of-life counselor

09:25.450 --> 09:28.420
Who can give you
further recommendations.

09:30.190 --> 09:32.850
Just trust me.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.770
This one's urgent.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.440
Yvonne Kowalchuk. ALS.

09:50.470 --> 09:52.310
It's bad. Late stages.

09:52.340 --> 09:54.410
Well, end stages, really.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.880
She was released this morning,

09:55.910 --> 09:57.850
And her son's been
caring for her.

10:03.790 --> 10:05.350
I quit.

10:05.390 --> 10:07.420
It won't last.

10:07.460 --> 10:10.290
You underestimate my willpower.

10:10.330 --> 10:12.230
Um, how old is her son?

10:12.260 --> 10:15.160
Charlie. 15.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.900
And he understands?

10:16.930 --> 10:19.870
He supports his mother's
decision wholeheartedly.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.340
He's a great kid.

10:23.340 --> 10:25.310
Nora.

10:25.340 --> 10:28.680
Nora? I thought
this would be for Joel.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.080
Joel is still with us.

10:30.110 --> 10:32.510
This isn't a same-day
delivery service, okay?

10:32.550 --> 10:34.326
I haven't yet confirmed
he's a good candidate.

10:34.350 --> 10:36.280
He's terminal. He wants to die.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.150
I know, and he's exhibiting

10:39.190 --> 10:41.690
Highs and lows,
erratic behavior.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.820
I just want to make sure
he knows what he wants.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.490
Okay. Whatever.

10:45.530 --> 10:48.200
But I am personally vouching
for Yvonne, okay?

10:48.230 --> 10:50.760
It is imminent, so, please,
no foreplay.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.370
I promised charlie, all right?

10:55.400 --> 10:57.470
So, you do have feelings.

10:57.510 --> 11:00.210
Buried somewhere deep down,
yeah.

11:01.710 --> 11:03.640
I'll see her later today.

11:04.850 --> 11:06.050
Thank you.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.550
Good luck with withdrawal.

11:14.860 --> 11:16.560
Hello? <i>- Dr. Harris.</i>

11:16.590 --> 11:18.430
<i>I'm Dr. Adrian Carmichael.</i>

11:18.460 --> 11:20.490
<i>I'm calling on behalf
of Joel Collins.</i>

11:20.530 --> 11:22.500
<i>I understand
you're working with him.</i>

11:22.530 --> 11:26.400
Yes, Joel came to Eden general
seeking palliative care.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.840
<i>- Yes, I know. He called me.</i>

11:27.870 --> 11:29.440
He told me that
you're pushing him

11:29.470 --> 11:31.610
Towards clinical trials.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.770
Not pushing,
but I mentioned them, yes.

11:33.810 --> 11:35.210
I want to make sure he's aware.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.580
He is aware.

11:37.610 --> 11:40.850
Look... We've treated his tumor
with aggressive radiation

11:40.880 --> 11:42.480
And chemo... the whole nine.

11:42.520 --> 11:45.820
Okay, but did you ever discuss
a more radical treatment

11:45.860 --> 11:48.420
Like stem cell trials, osmrs?

11:48.460 --> 11:51.690
I assure you.
We've tried everything.

11:51.730 --> 11:55.860
I do hope that Eden general can
accommodate his needs.

11:55.900 --> 11:59.200
<i>He's suffered enough.</i>

11:59.240 --> 12:01.200
You're right.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.700
Thank you.

12:06.210 --> 12:08.540
Good job.

12:08.580 --> 12:10.180
Yeah!

12:10.210 --> 12:11.780
I miss it, man.

12:11.810 --> 12:13.410
I miss it.

12:13.450 --> 12:15.626
As soon as my wife divorces me,
I'm going back to undercover.

12:15.650 --> 12:17.990
All right, come on.
Wendy is great.

12:18.020 --> 12:21.090
Yeah, Wendyâ€™s standing
between me and my damn dreams.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.760
Your dreams?

12:22.790 --> 12:24.290
Yeah.

12:24.330 --> 12:25.890
You ever see
those heated driveways?

12:25.930 --> 12:27.190
No, I...

12:27.230 --> 12:30.260
Melts the snow right off.
Well, I want one, bad.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.770
But Wendy thinks
it's frivolous, unnecessary.

12:32.800 --> 12:33.976
Yeah, that's because I'm the one

12:34.000 --> 12:35.076
That's shoveling
the damn driveway

12:35.100 --> 12:36.170
Every time it snows.

12:36.210 --> 12:38.140
You need better dreams, my man.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.310
I bet you know almost every
entry in that journal by now.

12:45.350 --> 12:47.550
Yeah, almost.

12:47.580 --> 12:49.350
You spoken to his father yet?

12:49.390 --> 12:50.580
Not since the first meeting.

12:50.620 --> 12:52.820
But he's coming in tonight
for a debrief.

12:52.860 --> 12:54.120
I want to deliver.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.560
Tonight?

12:55.590 --> 12:57.090
He's a judge. He's a busy man.

12:57.130 --> 12:58.260
Oh, man.

12:58.290 --> 13:01.660
Hey, when you get Mary,
and you will,

13:01.700 --> 13:05.570
You need her to tell you
exactly what she's going to do...

13:05.600 --> 13:07.770
An incriminating statement
that will hold up in court.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.300
I know, man.
I've done it before.

13:09.340 --> 13:11.170
All right, good.

13:11.210 --> 13:12.910
Just go give her
those puppy dog eyes,

13:12.940 --> 13:14.440
Get this bitch to kill you.

13:50.680 --> 13:51.910
Jumpy.

13:51.950 --> 13:53.410
Hey, we're packed
to go to dad's.

13:53.450 --> 13:55.320
You guys have any fun plans
tonight?

13:55.350 --> 13:57.080
Whee! Shoes on the bed!

13:57.120 --> 13:58.690
Me and Naomi are going
to Tristanâ€™s.

13:58.720 --> 13:59.950
He's having some people over.

13:59.990 --> 14:01.460
Naomi and I.

14:01.490 --> 14:03.190
Me and Naomi.

14:04.530 --> 14:05.890
How is she?

14:05.930 --> 14:07.590
She's telling everybody
at school

14:07.630 --> 14:09.830
She had a near-death experience.

14:09.870 --> 14:12.170
What's a near-death experience?

14:12.200 --> 14:15.370
It's just a way
of getting attention.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.146
You know, if anything happens
again with her,

14:17.170 --> 14:19.940
You can come to me, right?

14:19.980 --> 14:21.310
Yeah.

14:21.340 --> 14:22.540
Hey, mama?

14:22.580 --> 14:25.180
Yeah? Where's Casper?

14:34.690 --> 14:37.120
Put those in the bin. Thank you!

14:38.990 --> 14:41.330
Whoa, you okay? Yep, I got it.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.930
Hey, Mary. Hi.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.570
Naomi, how you feeling?

14:48.600 --> 14:51.200
Oh, you know, still breathing.

14:52.780 --> 14:54.270
You know you can take that off.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.040
Hm? Oh, yeah, I know.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.350
I just kind of like it.

15:00.580 --> 15:02.920
Our cat is dead.

15:02.950 --> 15:05.520
Oh, no.
I wanted to wait a little bit

15:05.550 --> 15:08.620
Before I told her,
but she asked, so...

15:09.930 --> 15:13.460
Hey. What's going on?

15:13.500 --> 15:15.800
Casper died.

15:15.830 --> 15:17.160
Really?

15:17.200 --> 15:18.830
But he was only, what? Seven?

15:18.870 --> 15:21.670
Cancer. It was all over.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.840
I had to, um, put him down.

15:23.870 --> 15:25.270
I think you did the right thing.

15:25.310 --> 15:26.516
You know,
when they're suffering,

15:26.540 --> 15:29.240
It's the only option.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.810
Can I have ice cream
since I'm sad?

15:31.850 --> 15:33.780
Give me a hug. Of course.

15:36.190 --> 15:37.320
Love you. Bye.

15:37.350 --> 15:38.750
I'm sorry.

15:43.730 --> 15:46.890
God, I loved that dumb cat.

15:46.930 --> 15:49.430
You should've told me.

15:49.470 --> 15:50.830
He's in a better place now.

15:50.870 --> 15:53.070
I have to get that.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.940
Hey.

15:54.970 --> 15:56.100
Um...

15:57.240 --> 15:59.040
You're late
on your child support.

15:59.070 --> 16:01.480
I just gave you two grand
in cash.

16:01.510 --> 16:03.810
Right.
But when am I getting the rest?

16:05.280 --> 16:07.180
I'll bring it
when I pick up the girls.

16:10.320 --> 16:13.250
Yeah?
Are you on your way to Yvonneâ€™s?

16:13.290 --> 16:14.890
Yeah. Leaving in five.

16:14.920 --> 16:17.160
<i>- Okay. I'm heading there now.</i>

16:17.190 --> 16:20.690
Hey, Des, never get married.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.800
You're the only woman
I want in my life permanently,

16:23.830 --> 16:25.930
<i>Which is why I keep rejecting
your sexual advances.</i>

16:27.400 --> 16:29.170
I have another call
I have to take.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.300
I'll... I'll meet you there.

16:37.010 --> 16:40.050
Hi, Joel.
I'm sorry about earlier.

16:40.080 --> 16:43.280
You said don't buy a gun.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.150
What? You said don't buy a gun.

16:45.190 --> 16:47.390
You said that you would help me.

16:47.420 --> 16:48.890
I want to help you. I do.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.620
You know what? It's fine.

16:50.660 --> 16:52.560
It's fine. I got this.

16:52.590 --> 16:54.130
<i>Good-bye, Mary.</i>

16:57.200 --> 16:58.600
Joel!

17:08.579 --> 17:10.740
Joel!

17:10.780 --> 17:12.250
Joel!

17:22.990 --> 17:25.530
What are you doing?

17:25.560 --> 17:29.530
What I should've done
in the first place.

17:29.570 --> 17:32.470
You don't want to do this.
Yes, I do.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.430
Not like this.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.240
You should help me.

17:52.090 --> 17:54.020
I'll help you.

17:58.930 --> 18:00.460
<i>You can lie down.</i>

18:00.500 --> 18:01.760
<i>- Thanks.</i>

18:11.270 --> 18:12.770
The money.

18:15.180 --> 18:16.840
I don't want it.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.350
Why?

18:20.650 --> 18:21.720
I just don't.

18:21.750 --> 18:24.250
What am I gonna do with it?

18:24.290 --> 18:25.590
Please take it.

18:25.620 --> 18:26.766
Come on, I don't want charity.

18:26.790 --> 18:28.720
Please. Please.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.530
<i>- What medications
are you taking?</i>

18:37.570 --> 18:40.900
<i>- Carbamazepine. Anti-seizure.</i>

18:40.940 --> 18:43.000
When did you take
your last dose?

18:43.040 --> 18:44.570
This morning.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.340
Is there anyone
you want to say good-bye to?

18:49.380 --> 18:52.510
Do you want to take a moment

18:52.550 --> 18:55.780
Or make any phone calls?

18:55.820 --> 18:57.250
No.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.060
Can you tell me again?

19:08.100 --> 19:10.030
Tell you what?

19:11.270 --> 19:13.200
Tell me how you're gonna do it.

19:15.570 --> 19:16.970
What do you mean?

19:17.010 --> 19:19.440
How you're gonna kill me.

19:19.470 --> 19:23.140
I mean, I know you... you told me
how they do it in Switzerland,

19:23.180 --> 19:27.350
But just... I really want to hear
how you're gonna do it.

19:40.260 --> 19:43.430
I need to wash my hands.

19:43.470 --> 19:44.900
Yeah, the sink's right there.

19:44.930 --> 19:47.530
Where's your bathroom?

19:47.570 --> 19:49.170
<i>- Down the hall.</i>

20:45.360 --> 20:47.730
So, you took carbamazepine
this morning?

20:47.760 --> 20:49.160
Yeah.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.200
Can I see the bottle?

20:50.230 --> 20:51.506
I need to know
what I'm working with.

20:51.530 --> 20:53.500
I threw it out this morning.

20:53.540 --> 20:55.570
I thought it was my last dose.

20:58.110 --> 21:00.340
I need to get your file.
It's in my car.

21:00.380 --> 21:03.640
Why do you have to get my file?

21:03.680 --> 21:06.010
I need to confirm
your medication.

21:06.050 --> 21:07.350
Maybe you could take a moment

21:07.380 --> 21:11.180
To think about what
you're grateful for...

21:11.220 --> 21:13.350
All the good things in life.

21:13.390 --> 21:15.036
You're gonna need a drink,
so why don't you

21:15.060 --> 21:16.690
Grab a beer from the fridge?

21:16.730 --> 21:18.830
I'll be right back.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.970
I've been waiting half an hour.

21:31.010 --> 21:32.840
Des, he's a cop!

21:32.870 --> 21:34.440
Who? <i>- Joel!</i>

21:34.480 --> 21:37.580
I'm at his apartment right now.
I almost killed him.

21:37.610 --> 21:40.380
How the hell do they know?
You think it's your nurse?

21:40.420 --> 21:43.380
Never. She would never do that.

21:43.420 --> 21:45.050
Look. I'm leaving now.

21:45.090 --> 21:46.720
But we can't do Yvonne.
Not tonight.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.120
So go in, make nice,
and tell her

21:48.160 --> 21:49.290
<i>We'll be back next week.</i>

21:49.320 --> 21:51.930
Get out, now.

22:10.710 --> 22:12.750
.Yeah, talk fast.

22:12.780 --> 22:14.456
She's by her car.
Can't see what she's doing.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.480
<i>I'm going in.</i>

22:15.520 --> 22:16.566
No. No, no, no. I'm coming down.

22:16.590 --> 22:18.380
I'm coming down.

22:25.430 --> 22:27.360
Mary! Hey! Hey!

22:27.400 --> 22:28.700
God.

22:32.030 --> 22:34.700
Hey. What are you doing?

22:36.810 --> 22:39.110
So, did you think about it?

22:39.140 --> 22:41.470
Think... think about what?

22:41.510 --> 22:42.740
What you're grateful for.

22:42.780 --> 22:44.280
Yes.

22:44.310 --> 22:45.410
Yes. I'm grateful for you.

22:45.450 --> 22:46.710
Here.

22:50.320 --> 22:51.320
Joel, listen to me.

22:51.350 --> 22:53.650
You're obviously upset
and struggling.

22:53.690 --> 22:55.990
But, you know, to be honest,
you kind of scare me.

22:56.020 --> 22:58.160
Why do I scare you?

22:58.190 --> 23:00.060
I wanted to help you
and counsel you,

23:00.100 --> 23:03.900
But the gun,
the erratic behavior, I...

23:03.930 --> 23:05.470
I just don't feel safe.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.670
I have to go now.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.540
No, please don't go.
Just take the money.

23:08.570 --> 23:09.800
Please. Mary.

23:11.540 --> 23:12.810
Mary!

23:30.930 --> 23:32.390
Things w-

23:32.430 --> 23:33.830
She knows.

23:33.860 --> 23:36.200
Nah. She likes you better alive.

23:36.230 --> 23:38.200
She knows.

23:40.570 --> 23:42.640
This is gonna be
a hell of a debrief.

23:42.670 --> 23:44.440
Yeah, what time
are we meeting judge grant?

23:44.470 --> 23:45.840
He's waiting for us now.

23:53.210 --> 23:56.180
And the second I turn 18,

23:56.220 --> 23:58.680
I'm gonna move to new york.
Oh, yeah?

23:58.720 --> 24:00.336
Hey, so, we said
we'd be home an hour ago.

24:00.360 --> 24:01.590
We should probably...

24:01.620 --> 24:03.360
It's fine.
They haven't even called us yet.

24:03.390 --> 24:05.720
It's fine. It's fine.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.660
So, have you seen that movie
"cabaret"?

24:07.700 --> 24:08.776
No. You've seen that movie.

24:08.800 --> 24:09.760
Of course you've seen
that movie.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.070
Well,
I'm gonna be just like them.

24:12.100 --> 24:16.070
Yeah.
Dancing and singing for money.

24:16.100 --> 24:17.840
Oh, I get it. Yeah.

24:17.870 --> 24:21.410
You're gonna be a star. Right?

24:21.440 --> 24:22.710
Yeah.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.280
Okay.

24:27.750 --> 24:29.250
What are you doing?

24:29.280 --> 24:30.720
It's cocaine.

24:38.030 --> 24:39.760
Stole it from my dad.

24:39.790 --> 24:41.130
You want some?

24:41.160 --> 24:43.100
No, I don't. I do.

24:43.130 --> 24:45.370
Hey, Naomi,
you were just in the hospital.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.000
You had a...
You had a really bad night.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.410
What does it feel like?

24:55.440 --> 24:59.280
It makes you feel
like you're a star.

24:59.310 --> 25:01.080
Okay. Okay?

25:09.490 --> 25:11.290
That's...

25:13.600 --> 25:15.090
I don't want to wake her.

25:15.130 --> 25:16.560
She doesn't sleep much
these days.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.700
That's okay. I understand.

25:20.100 --> 25:23.000
The thing is, charlie,
we have a bit of a situation.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.040
My mom wanted me
to show you this.

25:35.550 --> 25:37.720
<i>I've had a blessed life.</i>

25:40.120 --> 25:43.090
<i>I have my beautiful boy,
charlie.</i>

25:43.120 --> 25:46.330
<i>And when this is all over,
he'll go live with his dad,</i>

25:46.360 --> 25:50.300
<i>And maybe he'll even get
a better haircut.</i>

25:53.530 --> 25:57.700
<i>I've lived exactly the life</i>

25:57.740 --> 26:00.310
<i>I wanted to live.</i>

26:00.340 --> 26:02.040
<i>When it's time,</i>

26:02.080 --> 26:07.050
<i>I want the choice to die...</i>

26:07.080 --> 26:10.020
<i>The way I want to die.</i>

26:21.400 --> 26:23.430
Uh...

26:23.470 --> 26:26.230
How much is it again?

26:26.270 --> 26:27.800
Charlie, we...

26:30.770 --> 26:34.310
I'm afraid we're gonna have to
postpone your mom's appointment.

26:34.340 --> 26:35.510
I don't get it.

26:35.540 --> 26:38.110
We can't help your mom.
Not today.

26:38.150 --> 26:40.580
Annie said you'd do it today.
She made a mistake.

26:44.150 --> 26:45.820
But mom's ready. I'm ready!

26:45.850 --> 26:47.750
I know. I know.

26:49.420 --> 26:52.220
I'm... I'm sorry.

26:53.460 --> 26:54.890
What?

26:54.930 --> 26:56.760
Hey. Hey, don't leave.

26:58.100 --> 27:00.370
I'm sorry, charlie.

27:03.670 --> 27:05.340
I said don't leave!

27:13.580 --> 27:16.150
How'd it go with Yvonne?
Not great.

27:16.180 --> 27:17.680
I'm here with charlie now,

27:17.720 --> 27:19.550
And he's...
He's pointing a gun at my head.

27:19.590 --> 27:21.450
What? It's a small gun,

27:21.490 --> 27:24.390
But it's still a... a gun,
nonetheless.

27:24.430 --> 27:26.260
<i>- Tell her to come over. Please.</i>

27:26.290 --> 27:27.730
<i>- He said he wants you
to come over.</i>

27:27.760 --> 27:30.160
Annie promised.
She said you'd help us tonight,

27:30.200 --> 27:31.376
So you're gonna help us tonight.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.706
<i>- He said we're gonna help him...</i>

27:32.730 --> 27:35.870
I heard. Ah, !

27:35.900 --> 27:37.040
What's she saying?

27:37.070 --> 27:38.770
She said, "."

27:38.810 --> 27:41.770
My mom can't breathe.
She can't even move.

27:41.810 --> 27:43.010
You have to help her.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.980
Guys, I had to get rid
of the pento.

27:46.010 --> 27:48.450
What? What?

27:48.480 --> 27:49.510
What is it?

27:49.550 --> 27:51.950
Charlie,
we don't have the drugs.

27:53.990 --> 27:55.420
Stop messing with me.

27:55.460 --> 27:56.860
I'm not, all right?

27:56.890 --> 27:58.420
<i>So you can stop
pointing the gun at me.</i>

27:58.460 --> 28:00.230
<i>I'm gonna leave now.</i>

28:00.260 --> 28:02.030
Okay? Don't go.

28:02.060 --> 28:04.530
Easy. I said don't go!

28:04.570 --> 28:05.900
Please don't go!

28:05.930 --> 28:07.600
Aah!

28:11.610 --> 28:13.370
Everything's all right, mom.
It's okay.

28:13.410 --> 28:15.570
Des? Des!

28:15.610 --> 28:17.540
<i>- Des, are you okay?</i>

28:17.580 --> 28:19.340
I'm so sorry.
I didn't think it was loaded.

28:19.380 --> 28:20.926
I... I've never even
held it before, I...

28:20.950 --> 28:22.720
Oh, my god, Des, say something!

28:22.750 --> 28:24.380
Get me a towel!

28:24.420 --> 28:27.920
Shoulder wound.

28:27.960 --> 28:30.820
I'd call it a graze,
but it hurts like hell.

28:32.530 --> 28:34.536
<i>- You said it was a graze.
Is that true? Is that right?</i>

28:34.560 --> 28:36.560
Yeah, sure.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.860
Please. I have no one else.

28:47.210 --> 28:49.810
I really think
we need to help charlie.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.880
Okay, um, Des,

28:51.910 --> 28:54.780
You need to give me the name
of your dealer.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.110
That's a bad idea.

28:56.150 --> 28:58.850
You know another way
to get pento on short notice?

28:58.890 --> 29:00.720
All right.

29:00.760 --> 29:03.390
His name's Grady.

29:03.420 --> 29:05.760
<i>I'll send you his address,
let him know you're coming.</i>

29:05.790 --> 29:08.090
Mary...

29:08.130 --> 29:09.860
Mary, he's not a good person.

29:09.900 --> 29:11.730
I can handle it.
Send the address.

29:17.150 --> 29:18.580
I'

29:29.460 --> 29:31.020
Hi.

29:31.060 --> 29:32.990
I'm Mary, Des's friend.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.730
Hi, Mary.

29:36.770 --> 29:38.700
Can you take your shirt off?

29:42.610 --> 29:44.140
Are you kidding?

29:45.540 --> 29:47.980
No. I'm not the one laughing.

29:51.210 --> 29:53.010
I'm not taking off my shirt.

29:53.050 --> 29:57.850
Mary, in my business,
if I sell to the wrong client,

29:57.890 --> 30:00.920
Then they make me live in a cage
for 20 years.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.290
So, your politeness
and your modesty

30:03.330 --> 30:05.830
Is not a high priority for me.

30:05.860 --> 30:08.300
You don't need to trust me
to take my money.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.930
Take your shirt off, Mary.

30:24.250 --> 30:27.650
Happy? Yeah.

30:27.680 --> 30:29.280
Of course.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.180
I have a very good life.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.390
And I'm very happy
that you're not wearing a wire.

30:35.220 --> 30:37.260
You don't have track marks.

30:37.290 --> 30:39.790
The pento's not for me.
It's for Des.

30:41.060 --> 30:43.500
I just gave him a full box
the other day.

30:45.930 --> 30:47.230
He lost it.

30:51.710 --> 30:53.170
He lost it?

30:55.080 --> 30:56.640
Can I buy more from you?

30:56.680 --> 30:58.580
I mean, that's what you do,
right?

30:58.610 --> 31:00.480
Do you have any kids?

31:02.520 --> 31:04.620
I really have to get back
to Des.

31:04.650 --> 31:05.750
He's in rough shape.

31:05.790 --> 31:07.850
I have this little
step-niece, Maya.

31:07.890 --> 31:09.590
She's six.

31:09.630 --> 31:11.990
She's sleeping over.

31:12.030 --> 31:13.930
And she just plays.

31:13.960 --> 31:16.230
Color for hours.

31:16.270 --> 31:18.970
Love that kid.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.640
She's the cutest little thing.

31:27.310 --> 31:29.780
You're kind of cute too.

31:32.480 --> 31:34.380
You look good.

31:34.420 --> 31:36.620
Sid,

31:36.650 --> 31:41.020
Would you get Dr. Mary Harris
of 228 maple drive

31:41.060 --> 31:43.490
What she came here for tonight?

31:57.910 --> 32:01.610
You can count it if you want.

32:01.640 --> 32:04.280
Nah, we're good.

32:05.980 --> 32:07.550
Hey, Mary?

32:07.580 --> 32:08.580
Smile.

32:19.330 --> 32:21.130
Judge grant,
sorry to keep you waiting.

32:21.160 --> 32:23.100
I don't mind waiting
if it's for a good reason.

32:24.430 --> 32:27.170
Uh, "Joel" just met
with Dr. Harris.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.140
And? We're close.

32:29.170 --> 32:31.240
Close?

32:31.270 --> 32:33.010
I don't understand how it is

32:33.040 --> 32:34.216
That you guys don't have
enough evidence.

32:34.240 --> 32:36.080
Aren't these meetings
being recorded?

32:36.110 --> 32:37.910
Uh, yes, but unfortunately
we don't have

32:37.950 --> 32:39.610
Anything incriminating
on tape as yet.

32:39.650 --> 32:41.850
The... the suspect's working
under the pretense

32:41.880 --> 32:43.950
Of being some kind
of end-of-life counselor.

32:43.990 --> 32:46.090
What about the nurse
Ethan mentioned in his journal?

32:46.120 --> 32:49.620
Annie Chung. Works in the
intensive care at Eden general.

32:49.660 --> 32:51.960
The nurse is
just the liaison, sir.

32:51.990 --> 32:54.230
I mean, she connects
the patients to Dr. Harris.

32:54.260 --> 32:56.160
We burn her,
we burn the whole operation.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.830
Sir, look.
We know this is difficult,

32:57.870 --> 32:59.446
But the best way
to bring Dr. Harris down is

32:59.470 --> 33:00.770
To catch her in the act.

33:00.800 --> 33:03.040
Gentlemen,
my son had another year.

33:03.070 --> 33:04.400
He could've done
a clinical trial.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.546
He could've done
a million things.

33:05.570 --> 33:06.786
What he could not have done was

33:06.810 --> 33:08.380
Give consent,
which makes this murder.

33:08.410 --> 33:09.710
I assure you, sir,

33:09.750 --> 33:12.280
If Dr. Harris helped your son
die, we will prove it.

33:12.310 --> 33:13.880
Good.

33:18.750 --> 33:20.890
Charlie!

33:20.920 --> 33:22.490
Gonna need another towel.

33:26.130 --> 33:28.700
Look at that.

33:28.730 --> 33:29.800
Does it hurt?

33:29.830 --> 33:31.930
No. It feels lovely.

33:31.970 --> 33:33.330
Seriously, I-I didn't mean to.

33:33.370 --> 33:35.470
Shoot me? Yeah, funny, that.
And yet here we are.

33:36.770 --> 33:38.210
There's probably a lesson
about guns

33:38.240 --> 33:40.670
Embedded in all of this,
eh, charlie?

33:40.710 --> 33:42.780
My mom got the gun
after my dad left,

33:42.810 --> 33:44.510
Said it made her feel safer
at night.

33:48.450 --> 33:49.920
She's close.

33:51.150 --> 33:52.220
How can you tell?

33:52.250 --> 33:54.090
I was a doctor, too, charlie.

33:54.120 --> 33:57.290
Well, plastic surgeon.

33:57.330 --> 33:59.360
It was all very pleasant

33:59.390 --> 34:00.630
Until I did something stupid

34:00.660 --> 34:02.000
And they took my license away.

34:02.030 --> 34:04.560
Oh, thank Christ.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.040
Charlie.

34:13.909 --> 34:15.880
It's okay.

34:21.449 --> 34:23.480
It's all gonna be okay.

34:27.120 --> 34:30.719
Can I come in?

34:30.760 --> 34:32.690
Ugh, I got it,
I got it, I'm fine.

34:32.730 --> 34:34.900
Let's just do this and get out,
okay?

34:48.210 --> 34:49.710
She can't swallow.

34:52.580 --> 34:54.510
This is our first injection.

34:58.850 --> 35:00.790
It's not quite
how I pictured it.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.470
What are you doing?

35:18.040 --> 35:19.440
It's her favorite song.

35:19.470 --> 35:21.070
Oh, jeez. Des.

35:39.630 --> 35:41.230
You ready to do this, or what?

35:46.670 --> 35:48.130
I love you, mom.

35:53.940 --> 35:55.840
I want it to be peaceful.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.380
It will be.

35:58.780 --> 36:01.680
Like slipping into a dream
at the end of a long day.

37:40.900 --> 37:43.870
I promise.

37:57.750 --> 37:58.850
You got lucky.

37:58.880 --> 38:00.920
Yeah. That's exactly how I feel.

38:00.950 --> 38:03.050
Our last job.

38:03.090 --> 38:05.490
At least we went out
with a bang.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.060
Our last job? Well, I assumed,

38:07.090 --> 38:09.830
Since your gentleman turned out
to be an officer.

38:09.860 --> 38:12.230
Standing there with charlie
tonight, Des,

38:12.260 --> 38:13.930
I know what it feels to be him.

38:13.970 --> 38:15.670
I know. Except in my case,

38:15.700 --> 38:17.970
There was no one there
willing to help.

38:19.070 --> 38:20.440
Listen to me.

38:20.470 --> 38:23.240
Right now,
they don't have anything on us.

38:23.280 --> 38:25.210
So we just need to be smarter.

38:26.810 --> 38:28.350
You know what?

38:28.380 --> 38:31.050
I had a few ideas
while I was bleeding to death.

38:31.080 --> 38:32.880
Aging baby boomers are
gonna want to die

38:32.920 --> 38:34.550
In the same manner

38:34.590 --> 38:35.720
Bourgeois comfort.

38:35.750 --> 38:37.350
Now, the Swiss, they know that.

38:37.390 --> 38:41.290
That's why death tourism's such
a massive business over there.

38:41.330 --> 38:43.190
And? And we should be starting

38:43.230 --> 38:46.000
To buy up property,
getting ready to go legit.

38:46.030 --> 38:47.500
I'm serious.

38:47.530 --> 38:50.700
I'm having a...
An entrepreneurial seizure here.

38:50.740 --> 38:54.140
Let's be a...
A start-up for shutting down.

38:55.370 --> 38:57.640
"the spa you'll never
want to leave...

38:57.680 --> 38:59.010
And you won't."

38:59.040 --> 39:00.210
Des... if you're traveling

39:00.250 --> 39:02.210
The river Styx,
why not take a yacht?

39:02.250 --> 39:04.210
Where's the cat?

39:06.650 --> 39:09.790
I think I might have, uh...
Left the window open.

39:09.820 --> 39:11.890
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

39:11.920 --> 39:14.006
But there's a reason I've never
been responsible for anyone

39:14.030 --> 39:15.130
Or anything else.

39:15.160 --> 39:16.276
Except for lives, as a doctor.

39:16.300 --> 39:17.730
Yeah, look how that turned out.

39:19.030 --> 39:22.170
Well, it's a long way to fall.

39:33.510 --> 39:35.880
Ow. Why did you do that?

39:35.920 --> 39:37.750
I'm mad at you.

39:37.780 --> 39:39.450
Oh, my god, don't be mad at me.

39:39.490 --> 39:41.720
I hate it when you're mad at me.

39:41.750 --> 39:43.620
Where'd you go last night?

39:43.660 --> 39:45.036
I looked for you,
and you were gone.

39:45.060 --> 39:46.160
Yeah, I left,

39:46.190 --> 39:47.990
Because watching you
be a train wreck

39:48.030 --> 39:50.330
Is just really, really tedious,
so I...

39:50.360 --> 39:52.300
God, seriously,

39:52.330 --> 39:55.770
The cocaine wasn't even
that good.

39:55.800 --> 39:59.140
I mean, all that happened was,
like, everything sped up,

39:59.170 --> 40:01.810
And my heart...

40:03.180 --> 40:04.680
Come here. Feel my heart.

40:11.180 --> 40:12.780
Yeah.

40:12.820 --> 40:14.920
You... you didn't faint

40:14.950 --> 40:17.620
That other night
at our recital, did you?

40:17.660 --> 40:19.220
What?

40:19.260 --> 40:22.090
You took the... the stuff
from my mom's shed, right?

40:24.160 --> 40:25.760
I'm sorry.

40:25.800 --> 40:29.000
I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot!

40:29.030 --> 40:31.500
You know, I think there's
something wrong with my brain.

40:31.540 --> 40:32.800
I...

40:35.240 --> 40:37.670
Don't tell anyone
about the drugs, okay?

40:39.850 --> 40:42.610
Seriously,
my mom will send me away,

40:42.650 --> 40:44.180
And I'll never see you again.

40:46.390 --> 40:49.250
Jess? Please?

40:49.290 --> 40:51.220
Yeah. I won't...

40:51.260 --> 40:52.390
If you stop.

40:52.420 --> 40:54.620
Oh, god,
you sound like your mom.

40:54.660 --> 40:57.130
What do you mean,
I sound like my mom?

40:57.160 --> 40:59.000
At the hospital...

40:59.030 --> 41:01.000
I told her I took her drugs
from the shed,

41:01.030 --> 41:03.230
And she said
she wouldn't tell anyone

41:03.270 --> 41:06.100
If I cleaned up my act.

41:06.140 --> 41:07.370
Wait, she knew about it?

41:07.410 --> 41:09.110
Oh, yeah.

41:09.140 --> 41:12.080
And she totally covered
for me, too.

41:15.310 --> 41:17.150
I'm hungry. I want breakfast.

41:30.060 --> 41:32.860
Hello?
I, um, my name's Carly Dixon.

41:32.900 --> 41:36.830
I think you might know...
Or knew... my husband,

41:36.870 --> 41:38.170
Troy Dixon.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.000
<i>I found your number
on this pamphlet.</i>

41:42.910 --> 41:44.070
Are you there?

42:09.940 --> 42:12.000
Mary. Joel.

42:13.440 --> 42:16.610
No. Wait. You're not, are you?

42:16.640 --> 42:18.140
Not what?

42:18.180 --> 42:19.610
You're not Joel.

42:21.810 --> 42:23.080
Ben.

42:24.780 --> 42:26.120
Still Mary.

42:29.320 --> 42:30.920
I liked you better as Joel.

42:30.960 --> 42:32.390
You liked me better dying?

42:35.790 --> 42:37.590
Do you think I'm a criminal?

42:37.630 --> 42:39.730
What you're doing is
very illegal.

42:39.770 --> 42:42.100
What's illegal?

42:42.130 --> 42:44.800
Talking to people about options?

42:44.840 --> 42:48.170
About Switzerland? About death?

42:48.210 --> 42:49.740
If that's illegal, arrest me.

42:49.780 --> 42:51.810
If you think I'm a criminal,
arrest me.

42:51.840 --> 42:53.810
You don't get to play god, Mary.

42:53.850 --> 42:55.650
None of us do.

42:58.980 --> 43:01.380
I don't know
what to tell you, Ben.

43:03.390 --> 43:04.990
You got the wrong girl.
