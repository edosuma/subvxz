02:46.021 --> 02:49.268
- Bless you.
- It's freezing in here.

04:16.505 --> 04:19.242
- Look at that green thumb.
- I wish.

04:19.341 --> 04:21.035
- How's your sinuses?
- Better.

04:21.135 --> 04:22.778
Good.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.239
I should be home by 7:00.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.503
Honey, can you call the
landscapers again about the sod?

04:30.603 --> 04:32.672
They gotta get moving,
or we're gonna miss...

04:32.772 --> 04:35.457
- I'll try them again.
- Thanks, hon.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.854
Maybe it's the couch.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.763
Great!

05:03.561 --> 05:05.352
So...

05:06.848 --> 05:09.417
we were thinking...

05:09.517 --> 05:11.535
in here...

05:13.980 --> 05:16.341
with the...

05:16.441 --> 05:20.136
coming-out part along the wall?

05:20.236 --> 05:21.763
Okay, sure.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.724
And I guess come in through there.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.769
- Not through there?
- Right.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.345
- Okay.
- Great. Thanks.

05:33.032 --> 05:35.777
Big push. Four more.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.780
Three, two. Now reach
up to the corner.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.783
Up and up. Nice. Good stretch, Bev.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.785
Nice. Push it. Four more.

05:43.885 --> 05:47.288
Three, two. Sasha, here we go.
Take it around.

05:47.388 --> 05:50.208
Two, two. Down. Two, two.

05:50.308 --> 05:53.118
Two more. Here we go.
Let's smile, ladies.

05:54.979 --> 05:58.508
Right, two, three,
and left, two, three.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.510
Well, I just eventually found...

06:00.610 --> 06:03.263
the whole 12-step thing was like...

06:03.363 --> 06:05.431
just another form of addiction.

06:05.531 --> 06:08.726
- That's exactly what this book is saying.
- Yeah?

06:08.826 --> 06:11.396
Yeah, it's about how
to own your own life.

06:11.496 --> 06:15.650
Because what he's saying is that
we don't really own our own lives.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.902
We're taught what
to do, what to think....

06:18.002 --> 06:20.405
but emotionally we're
not really in charge.

06:20.505 --> 06:23.491
But see, I think that
with the exercise...

06:23.591 --> 06:26.202
and the diet and healthy foods...

06:26.302 --> 06:29.455
I just think he's very
good at certain things.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.291
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.501
- Have you read him, Carol?
- No.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.254
He's very good on certain things...

06:36.354 --> 06:37.964
emotional maintenance...

06:38.064 --> 06:40.925
stress management.

06:41.025 --> 06:44.971
You know, Carol, you do not sweat?

06:45.071 --> 06:48.182
Oh, I hate you.

06:48.282 --> 06:49.976
I know. It's true.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.385
No, it's great.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.365
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:04.465 --> 07:07.859
- Did you forget?
- No. It's inside.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.863
- I just...
- What?

07:13.057 --> 07:15.710
Something happened.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.619
Come in.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.881
How old was he?

07:31.951 --> 07:34.052
Five years older.

07:36.873 --> 07:40.475
He was the oldest of my mom's kids.

07:47.508 --> 07:48.858
It...

07:50.553 --> 07:52.538
wasn't...

07:52.638 --> 07:54.573
No.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.544
That's what everyone keeps...

07:58.644 --> 08:00.662
Not at all.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.554
'Cause he wasn't married.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.547
Right.

08:17.079 --> 08:19.180
It's just so unreal.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.913
- Did you see the den?
- At your party. It's gorgeous.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.749
You know, I'm suing the contractor.
Did I tell you?

08:36.849 --> 08:38.533
No.

08:39.684 --> 08:41.870
You don't even want to know.

08:43.813 --> 08:46.958
Fulvia? I'm home.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.115
Hello?

09:09.215 --> 09:10.908
Hi, Mother.

09:11.008 --> 09:13.953
What? No. I just walked in the door.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.154
That's all right.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.741
How are you feeling? How's your back?

09:21.102 --> 09:23.171
That's good.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.830
It's not a bad time, Mother.
I just...

09:26.983 --> 09:29.218
All right. That's fine.

09:29.318 --> 09:32.504
He's fine. They're fine.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.058
I will.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.759
I will, Mother.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.940
Okay.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.901
I'll talk to you soon.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.944
Okay.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.905
Bye-bye.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.314
Fulvia?

09:58.889 --> 10:01.866
Any telefono while I was gone?

10:06.564 --> 10:08.415
Oh, my God.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.181
No, missus. No telefono.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.549
Is this what they delivered?

10:20.286 --> 10:22.429
Fulvia?

10:25.124 --> 10:29.779
We did... We did not
order black. This is...

10:29.879 --> 10:32.731
This is... This is
not what we ordered.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.651
<i>Turn your love around</i>

10:37.637 --> 10:40.289
Yes, in Sherman Oaks.
May I have the number...

10:40.389 --> 10:43.626
for Nelson's on Riverside, please?

10:43.726 --> 10:46.077
I don't believe this.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.416
Ye... Thank you.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.226
Yes, may I have the shipping
or delivery depart...

11:00.326 --> 11:04.730
- Thank you.
- <i>That you're still in love with me</i>

11:04.830 --> 11:07.358
<i>We're gonna make it</i>

11:07.458 --> 11:11.279
<i>And we're gonna take
it back where we belong</i>

11:11.379 --> 11:13.646
<i>Turn your love around</i>

11:34.026 --> 11:35.761
- Mom?
- What, Rory?

11:35.861 --> 11:39.599
- Mom, soccer practice. Don't forget.
- I didn't forget last time.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.603
- Whatever. It's the bus. I gotta go.
- It was a mix-up. Okay.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.637
- Bye.
- Bye, honey.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.614
Fulvia?

12:02.614 --> 12:04.714
Fulvia?

12:06.809 --> 12:08.461
- Fulvia?
- Si?

12:08.561 --> 12:11.454
Where's my book? My telephone book?

12:11.780 --> 12:14.091
I put it in the bottom shelf...

12:14.191 --> 12:16.218
because of the cabinet men.

12:16.318 --> 12:19.045
Oh, okay. I see. Thanks.

12:20.698 --> 12:24.518
You've got to step back and say,
"Wait a minute.

12:24.618 --> 12:28.481
It's not an honor or a privilege
or even a duty to be a patient.

12:28.581 --> 12:33.194
If people don't want it on religious
grounds or quality-of-life grounds..."

12:33.294 --> 12:35.613
- Fulvia, could I have some milk?
- Si.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.658
- Some leche, por favor?
- Si, seguro que si.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.327
...to let a critically
ill patient die...

12:41.427 --> 12:44.705
but you're also saying it is all
right to hasten that death.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.833
- I didn't say that.
- I disagree with that.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.170
Isn't Elizabeth Bouvier, by starving
herself, hastening her own death?

12:51.270 --> 12:54.090
No, I think you have
to draw a distinction...

12:54.190 --> 12:58.010
between steps the doctor could
take to actively kill somebody...

12:58.110 --> 12:59.845
Senora.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.514
Thank you.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.391
You okay, missus?

13:03.491 --> 13:06.686
...and say, "Whatever happens, we are
going to withdraw from the situation."

13:06.786 --> 13:10.690
It's terrible to say with 30 seconds
left, but isn't that a thin line?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.858
But it's a very important line.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.236
It's one thing to remove
a piece of machinery...

13:15.336 --> 13:18.698
whether big as a respirator
or small as a feeding tube.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.659
It's another thing to say,
"His life isn't worth much anyway...

13:21.759 --> 13:24.152
so we're gonna help you out more."

13:45.991 --> 13:48.561
Sorry. They were in the back.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.397
Oh, it's okay. Thanks.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.692
- Oh, that purse is adorable!
- Thank you.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.819
- How's your little girl?
- Oh, she's fine.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.896
- She's so cute.
- Oh, thank you.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.659
Okay. Bye.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.828
Bye.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.289
No, we wanted teal.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.292
We ordered teal,
but we received black.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.586
But your original order shows black.

14:13.686 --> 14:17.622
That's impossible, because it
doesn't go with anything we have.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.750
All right.

14:22.903 --> 14:27.016
All right. Let me try the
Sherman Oaks store upstairs.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.934
See what they have in stock.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.802
Thank you.

14:32.329 --> 14:36.275
If I told you the end of
the world was coming...

14:36.375 --> 14:39.236
and you said to me that
you'd get on your knees...

14:39.336 --> 14:42.198
and you'd pray,
I'd say you're in trouble.

14:42.298 --> 14:46.786
Because when I go to bed and pull
those covers under my neck...

14:46.886 --> 14:50.623
I say, "Jesus, I'll see
you in the morning."

14:50.723 --> 14:52.833
You do that very well. Thank you.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.044
I was raised in a
fundamentalist church.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.672
I heard this all my life. We sang
songs about being in God's army...

14:58.772 --> 15:01.133
I think you've changed the subject.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.178
I see a president who's embattled...

15:04.278 --> 15:07.556
and a president who's, based on...
what do I base it on?...

15:07.656 --> 15:11.018
not being close to him but
close to people who are...

15:11.118 --> 15:15.105
in the press who watch him carefully,
as being very pained at the moment...

15:15.205 --> 15:17.691
and certainly...

15:17.791 --> 15:20.152
a man who wants to make his mark...

15:20.252 --> 15:22.988
I've never heard anybody ever
say he's that fundamentalist...

15:23.088 --> 15:25.074
that he believes the end is nigh.

15:25.174 --> 15:28.494
I really... You and I take a
different view on that one.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.419
But are you married to Marjoe?

15:33.057 --> 15:37.002
- No.
- Just, you sound... the technique.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.129
I just really believe...

15:39.229 --> 15:43.467
he thinks he's doing the Lord's work.
He's always been a very...

15:43.567 --> 15:46.669
Maybe he's right.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.227
<i>In California</i>

15:53.327 --> 15:56.838
<i>KABC talk radio</i>

17:30.924 --> 17:33.651
A movement to save the trees?

17:34.636 --> 17:38.374
Some say it goes deeper than that.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.877
Today, environmentalists
from all over the globe...

17:41.977 --> 17:46.131
are adopting a new, more holistic
approach to their studies...

17:46.231 --> 17:49.802
which they call "deep ecology."

17:49.902 --> 17:54.473
Deep ecology goes beyond the
traditional scientific framework...

17:54.573 --> 17:58.936
to incorporate a greater spiritual
awareness of the planet.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.939
Or, as ecophilosopher
Parlum Grass puts it...

18:02.039 --> 18:05.266
"an understanding of the
oneness of all life."

18:07.669 --> 18:12.157
"I have a feeling that we are entering
a new time," Pearcel writes...

18:12.257 --> 18:16.578
"a period of a different
paradigm or model.

18:16.678 --> 18:20.332
A period of learning to
run warm and cool...

18:20.432 --> 18:24.003
not hot and cold, toward viruses...

18:24.103 --> 18:26.037
cells, and one anoth..."

20:31.813 --> 20:35.801
I started this fruit diet.

20:35.901 --> 20:40.139
I've been so out of it since
my brother's funeral.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.892
- Have you ever done one?
- No.

20:43.992 --> 20:47.146
They're supposed to sort of
naturally cleanse the body...

20:47.246 --> 20:49.273
of all the toxins.

20:49.373 --> 20:52.776
I should do it.
I've been so run down lately.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.570
Really?

20:54.670 --> 20:57.531
Yeah, I've just been really busy.

20:57.631 --> 21:00.784
We have this client
dinner coming up, so...

21:00.884 --> 21:04.121
Right. Maybe you should try it.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.914
No.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.833
It'd be a lot of fun.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.242
We could do it together.

21:11.603 --> 21:15.215
Come on. Why don't you just try it?

21:15.315 --> 21:17.301
- Do you know what you want?
- Yes.

21:17.401 --> 21:20.836
I am going to have the fruit
salad and the herbal iced tea.

21:22.698 --> 21:25.883
Okay. And for you?

21:29.329 --> 21:31.380
I'll have the same.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.197
I got one. I got one.

21:38.297 --> 21:42.451
This beautiful, shapely blonde
runs into the emergency room...

21:42.551 --> 21:45.621
and when they ask her
what's wrong, she says...

21:45.721 --> 21:47.497
"It's kind of embarrassing...

21:47.597 --> 21:50.542
but I was using my vibrator,
and it got stuck.

21:50.642 --> 21:53.378
I can't get it out.
It's stuck inside."

21:53.478 --> 21:55.547
So they rush her into
emergency, admit her...

21:55.647 --> 21:58.967
they rush her to the operating room,
and they get some specialist...

21:59.067 --> 22:02.054
to perform the surgery,
and it's a ten-hour ordeal.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.182
And finally she wakes
up the next day...

22:05.282 --> 22:07.184
and the specialist
walks in and says...

22:07.284 --> 22:11.396
"Well, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

22:11.496 --> 22:15.150
The bad news is we did
everything we possibly could.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.820
We tried everything, but we just
couldn't get the darn thing out.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.822
We just couldn't.

22:20.922 --> 22:22.616
But the good news is...

22:22.716 --> 22:25.025
we were able to change
the batteries."

22:31.600 --> 22:34.285
Somebody doesn't seem
to like your jokes, Ted.

22:35.711 --> 22:37.037
Carol...

22:40.942 --> 22:43.127
Excuse me. I-I don't...

22:44.863 --> 22:46.380
Sorry.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.727
I'm so sorry, Greg.

23:00.670 --> 23:02.531
You're just...

23:02.631 --> 23:04.940
You're overexerted, I guess.

23:08.011 --> 23:09.820
I've never...

23:12.557 --> 23:15.326
Maybe the doctor can
give you something for it.

23:26.321 --> 23:28.339
Well.

23:29.449 --> 23:32.144
I really don't see anything
wrong with you, Carol.

23:32.244 --> 23:36.096
I mean, outside of a slight
rash and congestion.

23:36.998 --> 23:40.319
Now, I'll give you some ointment...

23:40.419 --> 23:43.246
and some decongestant, but...

23:44.172 --> 23:46.857
jeez, I-I don't know what else to do.

23:47.801 --> 23:50.569
Are you... Well, what?

23:51.680 --> 23:54.448
I guess I'm just a little
stressed out lately.

23:55.725 --> 23:57.586
And just tired from it.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.755
Well, that's not uncommon.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.632
You're not doing drugs, are you?

24:02.732 --> 24:04.968
No.

24:05.068 --> 24:08.472
I don't take drugs or drink or...

24:08.572 --> 24:11.850
I don't even, like coffee very much.

24:11.950 --> 24:16.521
I'm just a total
milkaholic, actually.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.815
I mean, before the fruit thing.

24:18.915 --> 24:21.443
Well, stop the fruit diet.
You need protein.

24:21.543 --> 24:24.196
And while you're at it...

24:24.296 --> 24:26.656
try staying off dairy.

24:26.756 --> 24:29.076
Dairy's very hard on
your digestion...

24:29.176 --> 24:31.370
hard on your intestines.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.790
I'll see you in a couple weeks.
You'll be fine.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.740
Thanks.

24:39.227 --> 24:42.798
"In the '80s, there are more and more
gangs in the Los Angeles basin...

24:42.898 --> 24:47.219
plus many more stabbings
and shootings by AK-47s...

24:47.319 --> 24:49.721
Uzis and MAC-10s...

24:49.821 --> 24:51.890
killing numerous innocent people.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.017
L.A. was the gang capital of America.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.395
Rapes, riots,
shooting innocent people...

24:56.495 --> 24:59.815
slashing throats,
arms and legs being dissected...

24:59.915 --> 25:02.901
were all common sights in
the black ghettos of L.A.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.946
Today, black and Chicano gangs
are coming into the valleys...

25:06.046 --> 25:08.657
in mostly white areas more and more.

25:08.757 --> 25:12.452
That's why gangs in L.A. are a
big American issue. Rory White."

25:12.552 --> 25:16.456
- Good job, Ror.
- Why does it have to be so gory?

25:16.556 --> 25:20.252
"Gory"? That's how it really is. God.

25:20.352 --> 25:23.588
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You want some coffee?

25:23.688 --> 25:25.789
Yeah, I'd love some.

25:35.283 --> 25:37.718
So what did Hubbard have to say?

25:38.703 --> 25:41.648
He just said I should...

25:41.748 --> 25:44.443
slow down a little, you know.

25:44.543 --> 25:48.196
Stop the fruit diet. Eat less dairy.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.449
That's exactly what I said, isn't it?

25:50.549 --> 25:53.525
I knew that whole fruit thing
didn't make any sense.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.498
But basically...

25:58.598 --> 26:02.627
there's nothing to really worry about,
aside from being a little run down.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.870
Well, that's good.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.216
So...

26:08.316 --> 26:10.385
Dad, how do you spell "Uzi"?

26:10.485 --> 26:12.878
Just how it sounds: U-Z-I.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.919
<i>...my dreams</i>

26:44.019 --> 26:46.453
<i>Get into my car</i>

26:47.731 --> 26:50.833
- Thanks.
- <i>Get out of my dreams</i>

26:52.068 --> 26:53.595
Carol...

26:53.695 --> 26:57.349
- we doing a regular cut today?
- Yeah.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.883
<i>Get out of my mind</i>

27:01.620 --> 27:04.189
Actually, I was thinking of-of...

27:04.289 --> 27:07.359
trying a perm for a change.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.402
Perming it.

27:09.502 --> 27:12.271
Elyse didn't tell me
you scheduled a perm.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.826
No, I didn't schedule one.

27:16.926 --> 27:19.955
I just thought of it now,
of trying it, unless...

27:20.055 --> 27:22.541
No. No, there's time, actually.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.252
I... I had a cancellation.

27:25.352 --> 27:28.129
- You still want that manicure?
- Sure.

27:28.229 --> 27:29.756
Thanks.

27:29.856 --> 27:33.885
<i>Let's make a deal Make it real</i>

27:33.985 --> 27:37.796
<i>Like a roadrunner coming after you</i>

28:22.158 --> 28:24.510
It's very cute on you.

28:32.836 --> 28:34.561
It looks nice.

28:37.298 --> 28:39.909
- Oh... Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

28:40.009 --> 28:42.319
Paula, do you have a Kleenex?
Do you...

28:44.723 --> 28:47.042
- Oh, my God!
- Anyway, so...

28:47.142 --> 28:50.086
so we meet him for lunch,
Cosford, Ted, and I...

28:50.186 --> 28:53.798
and who comes in but
this kid in shorts.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.718
He looked like he was
about Jonas's age.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.553
Couldn't believe it.

28:58.653 --> 29:01.681
Ted said I looked like
I'd seen a ghost.

29:01.781 --> 29:05.560
I like what they did with your hair.
It's great. I like it.

29:05.660 --> 29:07.678
I'm glad, honey.

29:09.539 --> 29:12.516
Yeah. Sexy.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.943
How you feeling?

29:28.850 --> 29:32.253
- I still have this...
- What?

29:32.353 --> 29:34.089
This head thing.

29:34.189 --> 29:36.633
Oh, boy.

29:36.733 --> 29:40.345
- Greg...
- Carol, what the hell is going on here?

29:40.445 --> 29:43.181
- Nothing.
- Nobody has a fucking headache...

29:43.281 --> 29:45.382
every night of the fucking week!

30:00.256 --> 30:02.534
I must have a touch of something,
because I...

30:02.634 --> 30:04.860
I don't want to hear about it.

30:15.897 --> 30:17.998
I'm sorry. I...

30:20.068 --> 30:22.753
I know it's not normal, but...

30:26.199 --> 30:28.300
I can't help it.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.606
Good night.

31:26.759 --> 31:29.788
Sixties at the beaches
and lower 70s downtown.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.915
Valleys will climb to the mid-70s.

31:32.015 --> 31:35.627
- Fifty-nine degrees in Hollywood.
- Traffic on KNX every six minutes.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.604
- Here's John Engel.
- Thanks, Susan.

31:37.704 --> 31:41.049
It's been another rough morning.
You need patience on the Southland freeways.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.760
It started with that downpour
you were talking about.

31:43.860 --> 31:46.888
Had a lot of rain.
Right now it's quite the hike.

31:46.988 --> 31:50.141
Sure hope you brought camping gear
for that Ventura westbound transition...

31:50.241 --> 31:52.143
to the Golden State southbound.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.813
Non-injury accident in the
left lane at the trans road.

31:54.913 --> 31:58.316
When you stop at Pacific,
that's what you have to Sherman Oaks.

31:58.416 --> 32:01.986
But there is some good news.
Just spoke to the van, and guess what?

32:02.086 --> 32:05.156
91 westbound's a cakewalk all
through the Santa Ana canyon.

32:05.256 --> 32:08.159
Actually, you're close to maximum speed.
You can even go...

32:08.259 --> 32:10.161
maybe 45 miles an hour...

32:10.261 --> 32:12.372
91 westbound to the 15
through the canyon...

32:12.472 --> 32:15.667
into Anaheim Hills,
and enjoy that while you can.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.419
I'm sorry, honey.

32:18.519 --> 32:20.370
Me too.

32:44.087 --> 32:46.444
It's okay.

32:49.944 --> 32:52.044
It's okay.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.237
Hey.

32:57.900 --> 32:59.743
You're all right.

33:03.147 --> 33:04.915
Jesus, honey.

33:08.194 --> 33:10.295
Take a deep breath and hold.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.600
Release.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.060
Again.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.896
Release.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.231
Again.

33:20.331 --> 33:23.568
Release. Again.

33:23.668 --> 33:25.352
Okay.

33:34.387 --> 33:36.497
Hey, Greg, how the hell are you?

33:36.597 --> 33:39.500
- Good, good. And you?
- I'm okay. Have a seat, guys.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.535
Well...

33:43.396 --> 33:46.716
basically, Carol,
you are perfectly healthy.

33:46.816 --> 33:51.294
If anything, your condition has slightly
improved since your last visit.

33:54.449 --> 33:57.643
Now, this is just
a suggestion, but...

33:57.869 --> 34:01.356
you might want to consult
someone, and I know...

34:01.456 --> 34:04.192
a very, very good doctor
who's just more suited...

34:04.292 --> 34:07.811
to stress-related conditions,
which I think this is.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.818
- A psychiatrist?
- Yeah.

35:59.740 --> 36:02.101
- Everything all right, ma'am?
- What?

36:02.201 --> 36:03.927
Yeah.

36:14.213 --> 36:16.398
What are you doing, honey?

36:19.343 --> 36:21.496
I...

36:21.596 --> 36:24.248
I couldn't sleep.

36:24.348 --> 36:26.667
The air, the...

36:26.767 --> 36:28.785
the smell.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.542
Okay.

36:43.289 --> 36:48.272
Clap. Slow it down.
And bring the knee up. Pull.

36:48.372 --> 36:52.110
Good. Get those knees up there.
Tummy in. Exhale. Exhale.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.612
And push it out. Here we go. Push.

36:54.712 --> 36:57.323
And right. Push left. Right.

36:57.423 --> 36:59.867
Four more. Three.

36:59.967 --> 37:02.370
Good! Let's scoop to the right.

37:02.470 --> 37:05.373
Two, three. Good.
Get that leg up there.

37:05.473 --> 37:07.917
Whoo!

37:08.017 --> 37:10.128
- Carol.
- Hi.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.798
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just have to get somewhere.

37:13.898 --> 37:17.385
Oh. I'll see you at Barbara's Sunday?

37:17.485 --> 37:18.970
- See you Sunday.
- Okay.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.004
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

37:52.186 --> 37:53.963
Do you work?

37:54.063 --> 37:55.840
No, I'm a house...

37:55.940 --> 37:58.718
I'm a homemaker.

37:58.818 --> 38:02.180
I'm working on some designs
for our house, though...

38:02.280 --> 38:05.382
in my spare time.

38:07.451 --> 38:11.012
And... And you have one child?

38:12.123 --> 38:14.692
My husband's little boy.

38:14.792 --> 38:18.696
He's not my son. He's my stepson.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.740
Rory.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.492
He's ten.

38:23.592 --> 38:26.069
How long have you
been feeling unwell?

38:27.305 --> 38:31.032
About two months.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.086
Three...

38:34.186 --> 38:37.089
I've been under a lot
of stress lately...

38:37.189 --> 38:39.550
and then my friend Linda and I...

38:39.650 --> 38:43.586
She's probably my best friend.
She lives down the...

38:43.912 --> 38:45.890
Anyway...

38:45.990 --> 38:50.311
we started this fruit diet together.

38:50.411 --> 38:52.846
I think that sort of set it off.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.351
So...

39:06.510 --> 39:09.330
- Are you uncomfortable?
- No. I...

39:09.430 --> 39:11.531
I just thought...

39:13.851 --> 39:15.660
I mean...

39:18.898 --> 39:21.124
Aren't you supposed to
ask more questions?

39:23.986 --> 39:26.421
Well, no.

39:28.574 --> 39:31.509
We really need to be
hearing from you.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.982
What's going on...

39:36.082 --> 39:38.141
in you?

39:42.296 --> 39:45.241
- Oh, that's so cute!
- Isn't it?

39:45.341 --> 39:48.244
- Look at this.
- I love that little bunny.

39:48.344 --> 39:52.623
- I know.
- I wonder what it could be.

39:52.723 --> 39:55.793
- Hope she doesn't...
- Oh, a baby book!

39:55.893 --> 39:59.213
- Look at that.
- Oh, God, it's beautiful!

39:59.313 --> 40:02.258
- You don't have one?
- No, no.

40:02.358 --> 40:05.177
- I'm so glad.
- I love it. It's perfect.

40:05.277 --> 40:09.181
If you need to take it back, I won't be
offended. It's from Neiman Marcus.

40:09.281 --> 40:11.934
Oh, no, no. I really love it.
It's perfect.

40:12.034 --> 40:17.273
It's so sweet. You should see my baby book.
It's this disgusting puke orange.

40:17.373 --> 40:20.443
- That's very appetizing, Barbara.
- I'm serious.

40:20.543 --> 40:23.821
Okay, Lynn. My turn.

40:23.921 --> 40:27.742
- Linda, thank you.
- I hope you like it.

40:27.842 --> 40:30.786
That's so pretty.
Did you wrap that yourself?

40:30.886 --> 40:34.457
God, are you kidding?
I wish I were that creative.

40:34.557 --> 40:36.584
I've seen you wrap things.

40:36.684 --> 40:39.378
Oh, I can't even
draw a straight line.

40:39.478 --> 40:42.214
Oh, God! I love this!

40:42.314 --> 40:44.759
- Do you?
- Look at this. It's a mobile.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.178
I thought it'd look
great over a crib.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.111
Who wants decaf?

40:50.489 --> 40:52.391
- Herbal tea?
- You must be so excited.

40:52.491 --> 40:55.186
- We're really happy.
- Real coffee?

40:55.286 --> 40:58.356
- He must be so happy.
- "Ecstatic" is more like it.

40:58.456 --> 41:02.276
- What do you think you'll name it?
- That is so great.

41:02.376 --> 41:03.944
- Barbara?
- Yeah, hon?

41:04.044 --> 41:06.072
- Where's your bathroom?
- There's a powder room...

41:06.172 --> 41:08.690
off the entrance hall to your right.

41:13.512 --> 41:15.905
I like "Tyler." Gary likes "Alex."

42:06.607 --> 42:08.134
Mommy!

42:08.234 --> 42:11.595
I heard you, Elyse! I don't know
what you should draw now!

42:11.695 --> 42:15.599
Let Mommy have grown-up time
with the other mommies, okay?

42:15.699 --> 42:19.103
Someone told me they heard
she was seeing their shrink...

42:19.203 --> 42:21.480
so I just thought you might have...

42:21.580 --> 42:24.191
No. I didn't even know that...

42:24.291 --> 42:26.444
Is something wrong with Carol?

42:26.544 --> 42:28.737
No. We were just...

42:28.837 --> 42:32.825
'Cause her skin looks kind of...
Her hair looks really cute, but...

42:32.925 --> 42:36.996
Elyse, your ice cream is melting,
and Mommy is very busy!

42:37.096 --> 42:38.789
- Did you get some?
- No.

42:38.889 --> 42:40.458
- Do you want some?
- No.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.575
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.048
Carol, this is yours.

42:48.148 --> 42:52.386
And you have to eat it immediately,
'cause it's melting all over.

42:52.486 --> 42:54.504
Oh, I shouldn't.

42:55.531 --> 42:57.933
- What do you got there, honey?
- My coloring book.

42:58.033 --> 43:00.060
Can I see?

43:00.160 --> 43:02.345
Oh! She's gotten so big.

43:05.082 --> 43:09.361
Barbara, this is delicious.

43:09.461 --> 43:12.072
You know, we haven't
really talked lately.

43:12.172 --> 43:14.241
How are you doing?

43:14.341 --> 43:16.327
Good. I've just been a little...

43:16.427 --> 43:18.996
- Lookit. It's you.
- Oh. Yeah.

43:19.096 --> 43:21.624
Under the weather.

43:21.724 --> 43:24.126
- Right.
- Lookit. She's a princess.

43:24.226 --> 43:27.296
Oh, that's very good.
It's very realistic.

43:27.396 --> 43:31.008
Ladies, we are now opening
the big present. Please come in.

43:31.108 --> 43:33.511
Okay. Here we come.

43:33.611 --> 43:37.213
Come on, Elyse. Let's go look
at the big present, okay?

43:40.784 --> 43:42.719
- Want to sit on my lap?
- Yeah.

43:47.374 --> 43:49.485
My God.

43:49.585 --> 43:53.364
- Look at this fancy wrapping.
- Yeah.

43:53.464 --> 43:55.699
You girls did too much.

43:55.799 --> 43:58.651
- Come on, don't be polite.
- I'm trying!

44:02.104 --> 44:03.791
A stroller!

44:03.891 --> 44:07.044
Oh, thank you!

44:07.144 --> 44:10.339
That's exactly the one I wanted! Oh!

44:10.439 --> 44:12.716
There's a package with
the wheels inside.

44:12.816 --> 44:16.002
You just screw them in.
Even you can do it.

44:36.507 --> 44:38.191
Mommy?

44:44.682 --> 44:46.917
Carol? You all right?

44:47.017 --> 44:48.794
Carol...

44:48.894 --> 44:52.673
- What's going on?
- I don't know. Carol?

44:52.773 --> 44:54.883
Oh, my God. Linda, what happened?

44:54.983 --> 44:56.552
She can't breathe!

44:56.652 --> 44:59.513
Eileen, call her house.
Someone should call her doctor.

44:59.613 --> 45:02.141
Jennifer, could you get
some water, please?

45:02.241 --> 45:04.467
Just try to relax, okay?

45:05.985 --> 45:09.607
- Calm down.
- It's okay. It's all gonna be fine.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.942
Just relax.

45:12.042 --> 45:14.143
Just... Just relax. Breathe.

45:19.717 --> 45:21.400
Carol!

45:41.905 --> 45:44.141
My name is Carol White...

45:44.241 --> 45:46.894
and I live in Southern California.

45:46.994 --> 45:50.397
I saw your notice at the
health club near my house...

45:50.497 --> 45:54.068
and decided to write and tell
you a little bit about myself.

45:54.168 --> 45:58.489
For some time now, I have
not been feeling up to par...

45:58.589 --> 46:03.160
and was hoping your organization
might be of some help.

46:03.260 --> 46:05.621
I'm originally from Texas...

46:05.721 --> 46:08.999
although I've lived in the
L.A. area most of my life.

46:09.099 --> 46:13.170
I had asthma as a child,
but it never really got in the way...

46:13.270 --> 46:15.547
of school or recreation.

46:15.647 --> 46:18.008
I've always thought of
myself as someone...

46:18.108 --> 46:20.594
with a pretty normal upbringing...

46:20.694 --> 46:23.472
and as basically a healthy person...

46:23.572 --> 46:25.766
but for the past several months...

46:25.866 --> 46:28.811
that has all started to change.

46:28.911 --> 46:32.005
Suddenly I find myself feeling sick.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.360
Honey, what's going on?

46:36.460 --> 46:38.529
I've been calling.
I thought you were asleep.

46:38.629 --> 46:41.156
Someone...
Brenda called about trading...

46:41.256 --> 46:43.701
Thursday carpool for Saturday
or something like that.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.235
She said you'd know
what that was about.

46:50.015 --> 46:53.460
Anyway, she said she'd call you back.

46:53.560 --> 46:57.079
I thought you were
asleep 'cause you weren't...

46:58.273 --> 47:00.217
Wh-What are you doing?

47:00.317 --> 47:03.085
I was writing this...

47:10.077 --> 47:11.878
I don't even...

47:24.508 --> 47:26.609
Oh, God, what is this?

47:28.428 --> 47:30.154
What?

47:39.815 --> 47:41.832
Where am I...

47:46.196 --> 47:48.464
right now?

47:52.411 --> 47:54.804
We're in our house.

47:59.543 --> 48:01.936
Greg and Carol's house.

48:39.750 --> 48:41.944
Who are you?

48:42.044 --> 48:45.656
You are of all ages and
from all walks of life.

48:45.756 --> 48:49.576
But you find you all have
one thing in common:

48:49.676 --> 48:52.862
strange, never-ending ailments.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.958
Suddenly you can't
cook dinner anymore...

48:56.058 --> 48:59.753
because the smell of the gas
from your stove makes you ill.

48:59.853 --> 49:04.174
Or if you take the freeway, you feel
as if you might choke on the fumes.

49:04.274 --> 49:08.178
Your family and friends tell you
that you're overreacting...

49:08.278 --> 49:10.722
that it's all in your head.

49:10.822 --> 49:13.517
But your symptoms worsen.

49:13.617 --> 49:16.979
Fatigue and depression
turn to migraines...

49:17.079 --> 49:20.858
blackouts, even seizures.

49:20.958 --> 49:23.068
Now, if this sounds familiar...

49:23.168 --> 49:25.644
you're not alone.

49:26.880 --> 49:30.951
What you most likely are is one of a
vastly growing number of people...

49:31.051 --> 49:33.912
who suffer from
environmental illness.

49:34.012 --> 49:37.332
That means that,
for reasons not yet known to us...

49:37.432 --> 49:41.378
certain people's natural tolerance
to everyday substances...

49:41.478 --> 49:43.714
is breaking down,
usually as a result...

49:43.814 --> 49:46.633
of some kind of chemical exposure.

49:46.733 --> 49:50.429
Today, there are 60,000
chemicals in everyday use...

49:50.529 --> 49:54.799
yet only ten percent are
tested for human toxicity.

49:55.951 --> 49:58.103
This is a disease that you catch...

49:58.203 --> 50:00.429
from your environment.

50:44.124 --> 50:46.405
Fulvia?

50:57.605 --> 50:59.705
Fulvia?

51:03.560 --> 51:05.202
Greg?

51:27.617 --> 51:28.595
Carol?

51:30.253 --> 51:32.197
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

51:32.297 --> 51:34.324
No, I'm sorry. I was just...

51:34.424 --> 51:37.452
I just took Fulvia down.
So did you just get home?

51:37.552 --> 51:40.831
- Yeah.
- So how did it go?

51:40.931 --> 51:45.043
- What?
- Your thing this morning.

51:45.143 --> 51:46.837
What was it on?

51:46.937 --> 51:50.924
Well, it was just this thing on getting
sick on fumes and bug sprays...

51:51.024 --> 51:53.250
and stuff.

51:54.402 --> 51:56.471
You mean, on...

51:56.571 --> 51:58.682
like, pollution?

51:58.782 --> 52:00.851
More about people who get
sick from chemicals...

52:00.951 --> 52:03.145
and what it does to you.

52:03.245 --> 52:05.355
Who told you to go to this?

52:05.455 --> 52:07.649
No, I just...

52:07.749 --> 52:11.018
At the health club, I saw a flyer.

52:13.630 --> 52:16.533
So you think this is
what's made you...

52:16.633 --> 52:19.610
I mean, why you've been sick?

52:21.179 --> 52:23.457
Because of... bug spray?

52:23.557 --> 52:26.909
No, I... I just...

52:32.149 --> 52:34.208
I don't know why.

53:00.427 --> 53:03.789
Okay, that's milk at .01 of three.

53:03.889 --> 53:05.916
So most of the time,
there's a trigger...

53:06.016 --> 53:08.418
new carpeting, new kitchen, new car.

53:08.518 --> 53:12.538
Or somebody works around paint
fumes or strong fragrances.

53:13.857 --> 53:16.593
Okay. No reaction. Please prepare...

53:16.693 --> 53:18.470
- .01 of two.
- Right.

53:18.570 --> 53:22.099
Then one day, bam, it hits you,
and suddenly your body is reacting...

53:22.199 --> 53:25.060
to everything like a Geiger counter...
food, air, everything.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.229
- .01 of two, milk.
- Thank you.

53:27.329 --> 53:30.941
What we're doing now is testing about
50 separate foods and molds...

53:31.041 --> 53:34.736
to determine what your neutralization
doses will consist of.

53:34.836 --> 53:38.147
And then they'll... they'll stop it?

53:38.573 --> 53:40.242
No. Arm, please.

53:40.342 --> 53:42.911
No, neutralization-provocation
is a way to aid you...

53:43.011 --> 53:46.790
during your cleaning-up process,
but that's all it really is, is an aid.

53:46.890 --> 53:49.126
Okay, this'll sting
just a little bit.

53:49.226 --> 53:51.461
Dr. Reynolds, call for you on 8.

53:51.561 --> 53:53.662
Dr. Reynolds, Eric Delaney on 8.

53:54.898 --> 53:57.717
Okay, that's milk at .01 of two.

53:57.817 --> 53:59.835
Excuse me.

54:01.071 --> 54:03.172
Are you okay?

54:04.532 --> 54:06.884
Eric, Dr. Reynolds. What's up?

54:08.620 --> 54:10.682
Right.

54:11.882 --> 54:14.109
Right.

54:15.210 --> 54:19.489
Well, look. If your oasis and twice-a-week
injections don't simmer you down...

54:19.589 --> 54:23.869
you know you have other hidden
sensitivities most likely molds or fungus.

54:23.969 --> 54:26.997
Continue the rare fruit diet,
and if you don't get better...

54:27.097 --> 54:29.666
check back with me or have
Dr. Baines check into...

54:29.766 --> 54:32.669
an unresolved Candida problem.

54:32.769 --> 54:36.423
- Dr. Reynolds, she's reacting.
- Eric, I gotta leave you.

54:36.523 --> 54:40.010
Prepare a neutralizing dose
at .01 of three, please.

54:40.110 --> 54:43.887
Carol, this will cease momentarily.
I apologize for any discomfort.

54:44.613 --> 54:47.976
Sarah, be sure to record...
pulse-rate change following injection.

54:48.076 --> 54:51.271
Okay. .01 of three milligrams.

54:51.371 --> 54:54.390
Okay, thank you.

54:56.584 --> 54:58.644
Just take it easy.

55:03.508 --> 55:05.660
Okay.

55:05.760 --> 55:08.830
Okay, we have palpitations
with deep distress...

55:08.930 --> 55:12.209
in conjunction with a
racing pulse rate of 104.

55:12.309 --> 55:14.910
There's flushing and some wheezing.

55:16.146 --> 55:18.122
Bit of swelling in the mouth.

55:20.567 --> 55:23.252
This is a big one, Carol.
Milk's a biggie.

55:24.446 --> 55:26.380
It's okay.

55:36.458 --> 55:38.434
Are you okay?

55:46.509 --> 55:48.444
Have some water.

55:53.933 --> 55:55.794
Yeah.

55:55.894 --> 55:59.256
We can turn it on and
off like a switch.

55:59.356 --> 56:02.207
We just don't know how
to make it go away.

56:07.781 --> 56:10.934
The first thing you need to
do in order to "clear"...

56:11.034 --> 56:14.896
is create an oasis in which to live.

56:14.996 --> 56:20.151
Your oasis is your safe place,
your toxic-free zone...

56:20.251 --> 56:23.812
where your load has been
significantly reduced.

56:25.090 --> 56:26.992
For some, that can mean...

56:27.092 --> 56:29.995
an airtight,
porcelain-lined enclosure...

56:30.095 --> 56:32.372
something like a refrigerator.

56:32.472 --> 56:34.541
For others, their safe room...

56:34.641 --> 56:38.420
is just a stripped-down
room within their house...

56:38.520 --> 56:41.715
that's conducive to
good ventilation...

56:41.815 --> 56:43.717
or air control.

56:43.817 --> 56:45.468
My name is Sarah Pinter.

56:45.568 --> 56:48.513
I live in Orange County,
near a fumigation company...

56:48.613 --> 56:51.725
and we're in the process of a
suit against the company...

56:51.825 --> 56:54.436
for improper handling of
their chemicals, so...

56:54.536 --> 56:58.398
Great. Thank you. Yes?

56:58.498 --> 57:00.692
Would you stand, please?

57:00.792 --> 57:04.362
My name is Abigail
Cartier-Rousseau...

57:04.462 --> 57:08.158
and my sensitivity
originated with fragrances.

57:08.258 --> 57:10.651
I was employed for 23 years.

57:10.977 --> 57:12.662
I've been spending some time...

57:12.762 --> 57:15.707
at the retreat in Wrenwood,
so I'm doing much better.

57:15.807 --> 57:17.334
Great. Great. Terrific.

57:17.434 --> 57:20.327
Thank you. And you, ma'am?

57:21.104 --> 57:22.996
Honey.

57:26.943 --> 57:30.430
My name's Carol White.
This is my husband, Greg.

57:30.530 --> 57:33.892
We live in the San Fernando Valley.

57:33.992 --> 57:35.926
Greg.

57:36.870 --> 57:39.189
We're here for my wife,
who's been ill...

57:39.289 --> 57:41.524
to learn more information...

57:41.624 --> 57:43.777
and hopefully gain from it as well.

57:43.877 --> 57:45.445
Thank you. I hope so too.

57:45.545 --> 57:47.447
My doctor thinks I'm nuts.

57:47.547 --> 57:50.200
He thinks the whole thing
is completely in my head.

57:50.300 --> 57:52.952
That's what my husband still thinks.

57:53.052 --> 57:55.747
It is in your head.
It's in all our heads.

57:55.847 --> 57:57.832
What do you mean by that, Helen?

57:57.932 --> 58:00.210
It makes you crazy. She's right.

58:00.310 --> 58:04.547
It ends up in your head because
it affects the neurological.

58:04.647 --> 58:07.717
And it will make you depressed.
It really will.

58:07.817 --> 58:10.804
I mean, how does a five-year-old
say it's psychosomatic?

58:10.904 --> 58:13.723
How does he make his eyes swell shut?

58:13.823 --> 58:17.185
Why would he want to do that?

58:17.285 --> 58:20.438
He can't go into
"Chunky Cheese" anymore.

58:20.538 --> 58:23.233
He can't go into ShowBiz.

58:23.333 --> 58:25.693
Why would he do that to himself?

58:25.793 --> 58:28.905
It's true. It's like,
you go into a building...

58:29.005 --> 58:31.533
you're walking along the hall.

58:31.633 --> 58:35.578
You don't know when that monster
is gonna jump out at you.

58:35.678 --> 58:37.997
You're just, like,
going along the wall...

58:38.097 --> 58:40.333
- like any normal person.
- Right.

58:40.433 --> 58:43.253
With your mask and
your oxygen tank...

58:43.353 --> 58:46.673
and your bottled water.

58:46.773 --> 58:49.259
So at first I didn't
understand why citrus...

58:49.359 --> 58:52.512
since I had tested negative
for citrus, until all of a sudden...

58:52.612 --> 58:55.723
I remembered how the oranges
had rolled out of their plastic...

58:55.823 --> 58:58.101
into the bag with
Greg's papers in them.

58:58.201 --> 59:01.688
'Cause newspapers, the ink...

59:01.788 --> 59:04.023
- Really?
- ...also... yeah.

59:04.123 --> 59:06.233
That, and...

59:06.876 --> 59:09.320
You know our couch?
Our beautiful new couch?

59:09.420 --> 59:12.198
- Yeah.
- Totally toxic.

59:12.298 --> 59:13.694
- Really?
- Yeah.

59:13.794 --> 59:17.694
- Wow.
- I know. So...

59:19.889 --> 59:22.459
It's hard. Like, I...

59:22.559 --> 59:24.919
I can't wear makeup anymore.

59:25.019 --> 59:27.829
- God.
- Burns my eyes. I get sick.

59:29.983 --> 59:32.802
Well, I guess one
good thing is just...

59:32.902 --> 59:35.346
how it's made you so much
more knowledgeable...

59:35.446 --> 59:37.932
on food and everything,
and chemicals.

59:38.032 --> 59:39.642
That's true.

59:39.742 --> 59:42.353
They just know so much more
about it there, though...

59:42.453 --> 59:45.847
the people who go through this.
I mean...

59:48.251 --> 59:51.070
So much of it, too,
is that we were raised...

59:51.170 --> 59:53.323
and grown in a chemical place.

59:53.423 --> 59:55.325
And you go into a grocery store...

59:55.425 --> 59:57.911
and you-you-you you
grab a chemical...

59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.946
without reading,
without investigating...

01:00:12.233 --> 01:00:14.000
Sorry.

01:00:17.238 --> 01:00:20.433
But anyway, it's just made me...

01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:24.020
more aware than I used to be.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.179
- You know what I mean?
- Yep.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:33.196
Next up, the load:

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.323
What is it, why is it...

01:00:35.423 --> 01:00:37.784
and what can be done to improve it?

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:40.912
First, what is your total load?

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:43.915
Well, in the chemical-laden
world in which we live...

01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:46.292
impurities are all around.

01:00:46.392 --> 01:00:49.921
Everyone must deal with a certain
amount of impurities and toxins...

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:53.174
at any given time,
and that's your load.

01:00:53.274 --> 01:00:55.885
It's the maximum amount of toxins...

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:57.762
your body can tolerate...

01:00:57.862 --> 01:01:00.056
which, for most people,
is rather large.

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:04.227
But a chemically sensitive person
is not able to carry a normal load.

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:07.146
What we have to do is unload.

01:01:07.246 --> 01:01:09.649
This means we go back to zero...

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:13.152
and, starting from scratch,
substance by substance...

01:01:13.252 --> 01:01:15.363
we build the load back up.

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:18.074
Remember, the goal is to get clear.

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:22.412
And so the safest and quickest
way to clear is to fast.

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:26.499
Fasting, which can last up to five days,
depending on the individual...

01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:29.752
is usually followed by
the rotation diet...

01:01:29.852 --> 01:01:31.713
or the rare foods diet...

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:33.923
both of which help
protect the system...

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:36.426
while reintroducing
foods back into it.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:38.428
Whatever diet you choose...

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:41.764
be sure to omit mold
antigen-containing foods...

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:44.434
like bread, cheese, alcohol...

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.853
ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise...

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:49.022
mustard, coffee, or chocolate.

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:51.983
Molds are very hard on
the immune system...

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:54.235
whether you're E.I. or not.

01:01:54.335 --> 01:01:56.446
And throughout your
unloading process...

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:59.824
be sure to have adjusted your
living conditions accordingly.

01:01:59.924 --> 01:02:03.911
Safe bodies need safe
environments in which to live...

01:02:04.011 --> 01:02:06.789
and there are healthy
alternatives that exist...

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:09.083
for just about every toxic product...

01:02:09.183 --> 01:02:11.753
gas, or ventilation system out there.

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:14.579
But it's up to you to find them.

01:02:37.044 --> 01:02:40.689
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We're spraying right now.

01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:45.485
Oh, my God!

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:53.252
Carol, you're doing fine.
Just hold in there.

01:02:53.352 --> 01:02:55.880
Move your head. Concentrate.

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.248
Keep your head to the side, Carol.

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:04.013
Keep with us, Carol.

01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:06.214
Carol, keep your head to the side.

01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:28.705
No unusual foods. No medication.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:31.666
- Emotional strain?
- No.

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:35.535
Well, can you think of anything
else that might be causing it?

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:40.800
So what you're saying, Carol,
is that this is based...

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:44.127
solely on the pesticide
and nothing else.

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:49.267
I have a chemical
impairment that makes...

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:52.928
I realize that, Carol, but it's just
not turning up on the tests.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:59.944
- Please don't do that!
- Nurse, don't spray that here.

01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:01.728
Thanks.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:07.410
Look, Carol,
from a medical standpoint...

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:10.788
there's no way to prove this thing
is an immune system breakdown...

01:04:10.888 --> 01:04:14.125
much less one based on
environmental factors.

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:18.796
Now, if your psychiatrists
can't provide...

01:04:18.896 --> 01:04:21.048
Think, honey. I mean...

01:04:21.148 --> 01:04:23.342
what gave you the bloody lip?

01:04:23.442 --> 01:04:27.879
- What would cause you to actually bleed?
- I don't know.

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:33.051
The chemicals.

01:04:38.624 --> 01:04:41.611
They visit them,
pray with them, get them...

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:43.654
New York...

01:04:43.754 --> 01:04:46.282
be the same again.

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:49.202
Things just started
tumbling down on top of me.

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:51.996
...is here to ensure
your team ring fits...

01:04:52.096 --> 01:04:55.291
No question, this is
gonna be a big sales...

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:59.086
It is a real problem, and I think
more people are becoming aware...

01:04:59.186 --> 01:05:01.839
because more and more people
are becoming sick from chemicals.

01:05:01.939 --> 01:05:04.008
Nestled in the foothills
of Albuquerque...

01:05:04.108 --> 01:05:08.471
the Wrenwood Center describes itself
as a nonprofit communal settlement...

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:11.140
dedicated to the healing individual.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.519
Offering the services of a combined
health retreat and community center...

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:17.271
- Wrenwood consists of 200 residents...
- Greg.

01:05:17.371 --> 01:05:19.982
- visitors, and staff, many of whom suffer...
- Greg!

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:22.485
- from chemical sensitivity...
- Listen. This thing's on.

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:25.279
...including its founder,
author Peter Dunning.

01:05:25.379 --> 01:05:28.574
Environmental illness is just one of
a cluster of new immune disorders...

01:05:28.674 --> 01:05:31.327
such as Epstein-Barr syndrome,
chronic fatigue syndrome...

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.120
and, of course, AIDS...

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.707
all of which continue to
elude conventional medicine.

01:05:36.807 --> 01:05:39.701
At Wrenwood, we offer an alternative.

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:44.006
I like to think of us as a
safe haven for troubled times.

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:46.050
We're the most extensive...

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:48.636
cooperative treatment
residency of our kind.

01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:51.722
But what I think makes
us really unique...

01:05:51.822 --> 01:05:54.392
- I think I...
- ...is our emphasis on the individual.

01:05:54.492 --> 01:05:55.810
What?

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:59.605
I heard about this place
from somewhere.

01:05:59.705 --> 01:06:02.733
...warning us of a
disease-ridden future?

01:06:02.833 --> 01:06:06.696
If so, the Wrenwood Center
is certainly ahead of its time.

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:08.781
People come for all
different reasons.

01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:12.034
I guess the thing we all have
in common is, like, why.

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:15.496
You know? Why did we all
get sick to begin with?

01:06:15.596 --> 01:06:17.697
What's it called?

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:21.159
Wrenwood.

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:35.483
It's right in here.

01:08:04.121 --> 01:08:05.773
Stop!

01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:07.974
Stop!

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.949
Not allowed!

01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:16.783
Go back!

01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:20.496
- Not allowed!
- What's she going on about?

01:08:20.595 --> 01:08:23.832
- Stop!
- Wait. You better stop.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:26.502
Stop!

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:28.504
Go back!

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:32.165
You're contaminating
this entire area!

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:35.919
How much do I owe you?

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.327
I see you.

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:46.447
Excuse me.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.587
- Excuse me. Are you Carol?
- Yes.

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:53.923
Hi. I'm Susan. I work with Claire.

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:55.925
- We've spoken on the phone.
- Hi.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.760
We're so glad you made it.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:01.138
I heard Nell making a ruckus.
I thought it might've been your car.

01:10:01.238 --> 01:10:03.140
- I hope she wasn't too...
- Oh, no.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.685
She's been having a rough time lately.
Her husband's very sick...

01:10:06.785 --> 01:10:09.271
and she's just...

01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:11.273
- well...
- That's okay.

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:14.068
Well, let me help you
with your things.

01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:16.195
I'll take this one.

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:18.271
- Thanks.
- Sure.

01:10:19.673 --> 01:10:22.535
This is a chemical-free zone.

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:26.205
We have reading boxes, safe TV...

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:28.541
and there's a 911 phone...

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:31.252
in case of any kind
of medical emergency.

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:33.546
Right.

01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:36.507
We're sorry your husband
wouldn't be able to join you.

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:39.802
I know. He's just in the
middle of all this business.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:43.305
They should be here soon,
though, he and our son.

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:46.267
- I should call them, actually.
- Sure, sure.

01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:49.469
- There's a phone inside at the center.
- Great.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:55.276
We acquired the center in 1978...

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:58.070
and we've been battling
to keep it ever since.

01:10:58.170 --> 01:11:00.823
But basically, this is where...

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:04.160
all group convening takes place.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.912
We have all of our workshops...

01:11:07.012 --> 01:11:09.999
and, our evening talks...

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:12.001
that sort of thing, here.

01:11:12.101 --> 01:11:15.713
The dining room is right
across the way...

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:18.591
- on the other side of the street.
- Oh, hi!

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:22.344
- You must be Carol.
- Carol, this is Claire, our director.

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:24.545
Hi. Welcome to Wrenwood.

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:27.715
How was your trip?

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:32.563
Whoops. Well, I guess
you're just wiped out.

01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:34.982
There's nothing more
debilitating than travel.

01:11:35.082 --> 01:11:37.610
Claire was hypersensitive when
she first came to Wrenwood.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:40.821
Now I'm just semi-hypersensitive,
like the rest of the world.

01:11:40.921 --> 01:11:43.616
- I'm a little... from the flight.
- I know.

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:47.494
We'll just quick get you checked in
and then take you to your cabin...

01:11:47.594 --> 01:11:49.705
and you can plop or
whatever till dinner.

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:52.291
But I know there are
quite a few people...

01:11:52.391 --> 01:11:54.418
who are anxious to meet you.

01:11:54.518 --> 01:11:56.086
Thank you.

01:11:56.186 --> 01:11:59.632
If you want to leave your bags
here and use the pay phones...

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:01.800
they are just beyond the chapel.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:04.919
- The little auditorium to the right. Okay?
- Okay.

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:10.758
Thank you.

01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:24.740
- Hello?
- Hi. It's me.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:28.077
- Hi. Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.454
Great!

01:12:30.554 --> 01:12:32.873
- Is it nice?
- Yeah.

01:12:32.973 --> 01:12:35.376
Great. That's great, honey.

01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:38.045
Yeah. You know, we'll see.

01:12:38.145 --> 01:12:41.048
Did you forget anything?

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:45.552
No, I just thought I'd call,
tell you I was here and everything.

01:12:45.652 --> 01:12:49.139
I'm glad you caught me.
We were about to go grab a bite.

01:12:49.239 --> 01:12:50.724
Oh, you go ahead.

01:12:50.824 --> 01:12:53.269
- I'm sorry. I just...
- No, no, I'm glad.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:56.105
I'm glad it's nice there.
That's great.

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:58.774
Look, you just relax...

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:01.277
and take care of yourself,
get well quick...

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:04.571
and we'll come see you
in a couple of weeks.

01:13:04.671 --> 01:13:07.825
Soon as I reach deadline on this.
Okay, babe?

01:13:07.925 --> 01:13:10.411
Okay.

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:12.788
- Love you.
- I love you too, hon.

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:14.373
Say hi to Ror.

01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:18.836
I will. And,
we'll talk again real soon.

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:20.713
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:22.923
- Bye-bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

01:13:23.023 --> 01:13:24.916
- Night.
- Night.

01:13:29.446 --> 01:13:31.890
I want to welcome all newcomers...

01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:34.768
all short- and long-term visitors...

01:13:34.868 --> 01:13:37.813
and extend our warmest support
for the acceleration...

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:40.399
of your healing process.

01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:42.401
So that you can relax...

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:44.820
and receive the full benefit
of your stay here...

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.189
we ask that you observe community
wishes in the following ways:

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:52.036
Silent meals are observed
at breakfast and lunch...

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:55.664
with a side of the room for
men and a side for women.

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:58.375
In addition, we ask you
to refrain from smoking...

01:13:58.475 --> 01:14:01.503
drinking, and use of recreational
drugs while on the premises...

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:05.466
and we ask that you respect our
practice of moderation in dress...

01:14:05.566 --> 01:14:08.594
and restraint in sexual interaction.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:11.847
Instead, we ask that you try...

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:14.641
to focus these feelings inward...

01:14:14.741 --> 01:14:18.270
toward your personal growth
and self-realization.

01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:21.315
End of speech. Welcome, everybody...

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:24.684
especially our long-termers,
Carol and Ward.

01:14:28.422 --> 01:14:30.449
And now, with no further ado...

01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:33.160
I give you our own Peter Dunning.

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:36.163
Yay, Peter!

01:14:36.263 --> 01:14:39.416
- Oh, you like this shirt?
- Are you familiar with his books?

01:14:39.516 --> 01:14:41.794
- No, I don't think so.
- They're so wonderful.

01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:43.379
I'll lend you some.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:46.715
Peter is a chemically
sensitive person with AIDS...

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:49.468
so his perspective
is incredibly vast.

01:14:49.568 --> 01:14:52.596
- My deepest welcome to Carol and Wade.
- Ward.

01:14:52.696 --> 01:14:56.424
W-Ward. Welcome to Wrenwood.

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:01.105
All right. If you'd all...

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:03.306
close your eyes...

01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:07.111
and pass your valuables to the front.

01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:10.021
No, no. Come on.

01:15:11.265 --> 01:15:13.992
Not really. Okay.

01:15:14.092 --> 01:15:17.830
So we're feeling good?
We're feeling warmth.

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:20.249
We can look into each other's eyes...

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:22.584
and actually see rejuvenation...

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:26.547
and personal
transformation happening.

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:28.257
Why?

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:31.584
Because we've left the
judgmental behind.

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:36.348
And with it...

01:15:36.448 --> 01:15:40.176
the shaming condition that kept
us locked up in all the pain.

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:44.773
But what I want to share
with you tonight...

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:47.642
what I want to give you tonight...

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:51.062
is an image to reflect on...

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.650
an image of a world outside...

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.654
as positive...

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:03.157
and as free...

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:07.161
as the world we've created here.

01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:11.258
Because when you look
out on the world...

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:13.501
from a place of love...

01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:17.421
and a place of forgiveness...

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:21.509
what you are seeing outside...

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:27.765
is a reflection of
what you feel within.

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:32.186
Does that make sense?

01:16:34.998 --> 01:16:36.465
So...

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:40.120
what do I see outside me?

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:44.833
I see the growth
of environmentalism. Right?

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:47.002
And holistic study.

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:51.872
I see a decline in
drugs and promiscuity.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:01.892
I see sensitivity training
in the workplace!

01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:04.102
- Yeah!
- And the men's movement.

01:17:04.202 --> 01:17:06.784
And multiculturalism.

01:17:07.664 --> 01:17:11.193
I see all these positive
things outside in the world...

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:14.530
because what I am seeing
is a global transformation...

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.897
identical to the transformation...

01:17:19.217 --> 01:17:22.236
I revel at within.

01:17:27.934 --> 01:17:29.994
And with that...

01:17:30.937 --> 01:17:34.800
We are one with the
power that created us.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:37.511
We are safe...

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:40.379
and all is well in our world.

01:17:48.246 --> 01:17:52.401
<i>Kind friends all gathered 'round</i>

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:55.404
<i>There's something I would say</i>

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:59.116
<i>That what brings us together here</i>

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:04.121
<i>Has blessed us all today</i>

01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:08.041
<i>Love has made a circle</i>

01:18:08.141 --> 01:18:11.753
<i>That holds us all inside</i>

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:16.133
<i>Where strangers are as family</i>

01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:21.138
<i>And loneliness can't hide</i>

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:25.601
<i>So give yourself to love</i>

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:29.813
<i>If love is what you're after</i>

01:18:29.913 --> 01:18:33.817
<i>Open up your hearts to</i>

01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:37.029
<i>The tears and laughter, and</i>

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:40.824
<i>Give yourself to love</i>

01:18:40.924 --> 01:18:45.194
<i>Give yourself to love</i>

01:20:36.414 --> 01:20:39.401
Carol? I'm sorry.

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:42.237
- Are you having a reaction?
- No. No.

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:44.188
I'm fine.

01:21:02.357 --> 01:21:04.229
Oh, come on.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:12.350
That's okay.

01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:14.412
Just breathe.

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:18.413
That's right.

01:21:18.539 --> 01:21:20.307
Good.

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:26.563
That's good. You're okay.

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:32.788
Tsk. Oh, Carol.

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:35.322
You know something?

01:21:36.349 --> 01:21:40.661
All these feelings you're
having are just fine.

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:43.664
They're so natural.

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:48.720
I mean, you've just done
something so big...

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.431
you know, something...

01:21:51.531 --> 01:21:54.309
many people never do
in their lifetimes.

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:58.897
You've taken this big
step on your own behalf.

01:21:58.997 --> 01:22:03.652
You've... left behind everything
that's known and secure...

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:06.696
and all the people you
love and trust...

01:22:06.796 --> 01:22:09.866
and you've come to this
strange new place...

01:22:09.966 --> 01:22:12.109
with strange new people.

01:22:14.721 --> 01:22:17.457
It's completely understandable...

01:22:17.557 --> 01:22:19.918
that you might feel lonely...

01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:23.537
or fearful or even angry.

01:22:27.817 --> 01:22:29.886
You know...

01:22:29.986 --> 01:22:33.047
when I first came here,
I couldn't even walk.

01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:38.353
I'd been living six miles
from this chemical factory...

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:41.314
this was in Michigan...

01:22:41.414 --> 01:22:45.068
that was leaking, like, 15 gallons...

01:22:45.168 --> 01:22:47.853
of chemical by-products every day.

01:22:49.923 --> 01:22:54.119
When I got here, all I could do
was just sit in my safe room...

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:56.246
and every day...

01:22:56.346 --> 01:22:59.374
every hour of every day...

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:01.710
I would look at myself
in the mirror...

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:05.255
and I would say to myself...

01:23:05.355 --> 01:23:07.674
"Claire...

01:23:07.774 --> 01:23:09.833
I love you.

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.921
I really love you."

01:23:17.742 --> 01:23:20.896
At the end of the month,
I could leave my room...

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:24.848
and shortly thereafter,
I was walking.

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:30.196
For me...

01:23:30.296 --> 01:23:34.242
this was a gift,
this whole thing was a gift...

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:37.704
because everything
got taken away from me.

01:23:37.804 --> 01:23:39.873
I... I mean...

01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:44.628
everything in the material world.

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:47.746
And what was left...

01:23:49.232 --> 01:23:51.041
was me.

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:01.635
Thank you, Claire.

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:05.806
Are you better?

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:09.143
You'll do fine.

01:24:14.257 --> 01:24:16.117
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:17.734
Good night.

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:52.278
<i>Forever and ever...</i>

01:24:52.378 --> 01:24:54.521
<i>You're right where I found...</i>

01:24:58.593 --> 01:25:01.695
<i>Sweet love's showin' us...</i>

01:25:03.556 --> 01:25:06.783
<i>Never seen such a beautiful...</i>

01:25:29.499 --> 01:25:32.610
Dear Greg and Rory...

01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:34.696
how are you guys?

01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:38.700
I hope everything is going good.
I really miss you.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:42.662
I'm feeling a little better, so I
decided to stay the full amount.

01:25:42.762 --> 01:25:45.290
At first it was hard
to get used to...

01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:47.917
but now I really think
it's starting to help.

01:25:48.017 --> 01:25:51.421
I've been so much more relaxed
and eating healthfully...

01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:54.539
and the desert landscape
is really beautiful here.

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:17.781
I can't wait till the 25th
to show you around...

01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:20.492
and introduce you to everyone.

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:23.953
Give my love to Sally and
your mother and Linda...

01:26:24.053 --> 01:26:27.123
and be sure and help your dad, Ror.

01:26:27.223 --> 01:26:29.783
Love and kisses, Carol.

01:26:45.074 --> 01:26:47.268
Is that Lester you're watching?

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:49.437
Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:51.272
Oh, it's fine.

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:54.734
I was just watching him go by.

01:26:54.834 --> 01:26:57.070
Why does he...

01:26:57.170 --> 01:27:01.157
Oh, poor Lester. He's just...

01:27:01.257 --> 01:27:03.451
very, very afraid...

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:06.236
afraid to eat, afraid to breathe.

01:27:10.391 --> 01:27:12.836
But let's talk about you.

01:27:12.936 --> 01:27:15.463
I heard you weren't feeling so hot.

01:27:15.563 --> 01:27:17.865
It was just a little...

01:27:18.191 --> 01:27:21.678
shortness of breath
and some dizziness.

01:27:21.778 --> 01:27:23.972
I noticed the highway near here...

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:26.474
and I wondered if maybe
my cabin room...

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:29.227
was a little downwind or something.

01:27:29.327 --> 01:27:31.604
I thought maybe if I
tried another cabin...

01:27:31.704 --> 01:27:34.271
Claire would be the best
person to speak to about that.

01:27:34.371 --> 01:27:36.044
- Claire is?
- She's really the one.

01:27:36.144 --> 01:27:37.918
Okay.

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:43.158
I remember Claire sharing with me a
little while back some concern over you.

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:45.692
That you'd been feeling
some remorse...

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:50.030
maybe some apprehension.

01:27:52.392 --> 01:27:54.294
- I was just...
- All I'm saying...

01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:58.715
is that these feelings you're having,
Carol, are extremely common...

01:27:58.815 --> 01:28:01.759
especially in relation
to new environments.

01:28:01.859 --> 01:28:05.555
Especially for someone who's
environmentally ill, okay?

01:28:05.655 --> 01:28:08.516
And what we're about is
trying to help absorb...

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:10.977
as many of these
tensions as we can...

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:13.688
so you're free to do
the kind of healing...

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:15.982
that you need to be doing.

01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:18.067
- Does that make any sense?
- Yes.

01:28:18.167 --> 01:28:20.612
'Cause when that's accomplished,
I'm doing my job.

01:28:20.712 --> 01:28:23.323
No, I know.
I'm just still learning...

01:28:23.423 --> 01:28:26.993
you know, the words.

01:28:27.093 --> 01:28:29.537
Oh. Well...

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:31.706
the words are...

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:34.834
just the way to get to what's true.

01:28:34.934 --> 01:28:36.336
- Right?
- Right.

01:28:36.436 --> 01:28:37.879
- See the coyote?
- Where?

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:40.080
Straight.

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:38.138
- Is that all right?
- Sure.

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:43.111
I need a partner.

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:45.655
Great.

01:29:45.755 --> 01:29:48.199
Guess we'll have to
figure out what to cook.

01:29:48.299 --> 01:29:50.150
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:53.955
All right, well...

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:57.375
I'll think about... what to cook.

01:29:57.475 --> 01:29:59.576
Me too.

01:30:00.686 --> 01:30:02.537
Bye.

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:10.346
She had all these little
different, you know...

01:30:10.446 --> 01:30:14.799
candies and stuff
she'd keep in there.

01:30:18.496 --> 01:30:22.191
She used to let me open the clasp
and look inside the purse...

01:30:22.291 --> 01:30:25.528
then close the clasp.

01:30:25.628 --> 01:30:28.313
I'll never forget that purse.

01:30:32.051 --> 01:30:33.870
Okay.

01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:36.456
Now, speaker number two...

01:30:36.556 --> 01:30:39.667
describe to your friend a room...

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:42.202
you remember having as a child.

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:58.051
God, this is...

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:06.226
I guess this one I had was...

01:31:08.671 --> 01:31:10.564
had...

01:31:11.507 --> 01:31:13.704
yellow wallpaper...

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:16.176
and...

01:31:24.562 --> 01:31:27.131
What's going on over there?

01:31:27.231 --> 01:31:29.592
- Oh, my God.
- Who's that?

01:31:29.692 --> 01:31:31.928
- Who's the guy?
- I don't know.

01:31:32.028 --> 01:31:36.298
- I think it's Nell's husband.
- That looks like Nell's husband.

01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:50.437
Today...

01:31:53.508 --> 01:31:55.910
is another...

01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:58.612
precious day on earth...

01:32:00.598 --> 01:32:02.708
so let's throw away...

01:32:02.808 --> 01:32:04.784
every negative...

01:32:07.063 --> 01:32:10.206
destructive thought we might have...

01:32:11.859 --> 01:32:14.461
and look around ourselves with love.

01:32:21.327 --> 01:32:23.637
I tried to teach him this...

01:32:28.334 --> 01:32:30.810
to give up the rage...

01:32:36.008 --> 01:32:38.610
to strive for a quiet mind.

01:32:47.277 --> 01:32:49.797
My concern is, it sounds
like a spiraling down.

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:52.884
If you're feeling more sensitive
to the fumes that way...

01:32:52.984 --> 01:32:55.627
you shouldn't really be outside.

01:32:56.737 --> 01:33:00.766
The problem is, there just aren't any
center accommodations available now...

01:33:00.866 --> 01:33:03.102
except for cabins and dormitories.

01:33:03.202 --> 01:33:05.480
Oh, I'm fine, really.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:09.317
Oh, except for Harry's.

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:11.694
Harry's?

01:33:11.794 --> 01:33:14.489
Mr. Keene, Nell's husband,
built a safe house.

01:33:14.589 --> 01:33:16.908
You can see it.
It's right next to recycling...

01:33:17.008 --> 01:33:19.160
over there, the little white igloo.

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:22.205
- He lived in that?
- Oh, yeah.

01:33:22.305 --> 01:33:25.708
After his stroke, he needed
a more controllable space...

01:33:25.808 --> 01:33:29.629
so she stayed in the cabin,
and he lived in the safe house.

01:33:29.729 --> 01:33:31.839
And he actually improved.

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:34.175
It's ventilated and
porcelain-lined...

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:38.461
and he was perfectly safe as
long as no one set foot inside.

01:33:39.947 --> 01:33:42.632
I don't know what she's
planning to do with it.

01:33:52.418 --> 01:33:55.979
Ladies and gentlemen, I have
a confession I'd like to make.

01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:01.651
I've stopped reading the papers.

01:34:05.056 --> 01:34:07.741
I've stopped watching the news on TV.

01:34:10.436 --> 01:34:12.838
I've heard the media
gloom and doom...

01:34:12.938 --> 01:34:16.217
and I've seen their fatalistic,
negative attitude...

01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:19.711
and I finally realized,
once and for all, I don't need it.

01:34:21.947 --> 01:34:25.351
And so I transform that
negative stimulus...

01:34:25.451 --> 01:34:28.219
into something that
will not do harm to me.

01:34:31.374 --> 01:34:34.601
Because if I really
believe that life is...

01:34:37.296 --> 01:34:40.523
that devastating, that destructive...

01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:48.114
I'm afraid that my immune
system will believe it too...

01:34:51.143 --> 01:34:53.620
and I can't afford to take that risk.

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:58.625
Neither can you.

01:35:13.207 --> 01:35:14.734
We are one...

01:35:14.834 --> 01:35:17.612
With the power that created us.

01:35:17.712 --> 01:35:20.990
- We are safe...
- We are safe...

01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:23.483
and all is well in our world.

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:34.295
So my brother called,
and Darlene had another girl.

01:35:34.395 --> 01:35:37.163
Oh. I'll call them tonight.

01:35:38.232 --> 01:35:41.135
Oh, and Linda called
and said to hurry up...

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:43.888
and clear or clean
or whatever it is...

01:35:43.988 --> 01:35:46.891
- "Clear."
- ...and come on home.

01:35:46.991 --> 01:35:49.092
That's sweet.

01:35:56.333 --> 01:35:59.236
So you really feel like it's...

01:35:59.336 --> 01:36:02.156
still the right choice? I mean...

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:05.159
Yeah, I...

01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:07.703
I do. I mean...

01:36:07.803 --> 01:36:10.498
right before the fumes, I was good.

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:12.667
My load was up.

01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:15.378
I was eating well, so...

01:36:15.478 --> 01:36:18.005
What did they say about the fumes?

01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:22.542
Just that I'd probably move to another,
different cabin somewhere...

01:36:23.594 --> 01:36:26.263
where I won't feel them.

01:36:26.363 --> 01:36:28.298
Right.

01:36:30.701 --> 01:36:32.603
Okay.

01:36:32.703 --> 01:36:36.399
I just think it's
true what they say...

01:36:36.499 --> 01:36:40.351
that it's up to the individual,
and that it takes time.

01:36:42.588 --> 01:36:44.314
Right.

01:36:48.803 --> 01:36:51.956
- Whose house is that?
- That's Peter's.

01:36:52.056 --> 01:36:55.418
- It's gorgeous, isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:36:55.518 --> 01:36:59.078
- Feel like moving?
- No.

01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:25.221
She's...

01:37:27.466 --> 01:37:29.984
Her husband just passed away.

01:37:36.475 --> 01:37:38.576
Come on, Rory.

01:37:42.314 --> 01:37:44.123
Now!

01:37:52.658 --> 01:37:54.226
Steve...

01:37:54.326 --> 01:37:56.604
why did you become sick?

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:59.899
Well, I became sick...

01:37:59.999 --> 01:38:03.601
because I just O.D.'d
on all the drugs I was doing.

01:38:05.198 --> 01:38:07.438
Why did you become addicted?

01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:10.451
Well, I guess I became addicted...

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:13.746
to, like, blot out the pain...

01:38:13.846 --> 01:38:17.323
of not liking myself.

01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:21.661
Of hating myself, really.

01:38:23.439 --> 01:38:25.841
Self-hatred.

01:38:25.941 --> 01:38:27.667
Yep.

01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:31.337
Okay. Thanks, Steve.

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:36.560
- Hello, Joyce.
- Hi.

01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:39.178
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

01:38:40.372 --> 01:38:43.474
Joyce, what do you think
was behind your illness?

01:38:44.376 --> 01:38:46.436
Why did you become sick?

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:51.909
I believe that I made myself sick...

01:38:52.009 --> 01:38:54.161
after my son got sick...

01:38:54.261 --> 01:38:57.456
because I was just...

01:38:57.556 --> 01:39:01.836
Well, you get so eaten
up with guilt, really.

01:39:01.936 --> 01:39:05.172
You know, because I felt
that I had done it to him.

01:39:05.272 --> 01:39:08.342
I was the one who put
him in that school.

01:39:08.442 --> 01:39:10.636
I put him in that environment.

01:39:10.736 --> 01:39:12.879
You were punishing yourself.

01:39:19.119 --> 01:39:20.803
Yeah.

01:39:42.309 --> 01:39:43.951
Thanks.

01:39:46.188 --> 01:39:47.914
Marilyn?

01:39:51.443 --> 01:39:53.344
I was...

01:39:55.489 --> 01:39:58.841
deeply wounded as a child...

01:39:59.994 --> 01:40:04.565
and had completely blocked
it out for years...

01:40:04.665 --> 01:40:08.944
and then, suddenly became very ill.

01:40:09.044 --> 01:40:11.145
Why, do you think?

01:40:13.507 --> 01:40:16.911
Maybe to let myself know
something was wrong.

01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:19.413
Okay.

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:22.124
And...

01:40:22.224 --> 01:40:25.118
the person who hurt you the most...

01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:29.539
Was me.

01:40:31.608 --> 01:40:34.127
For?

01:40:36.864 --> 01:40:38.965
Not forgiving him.

01:40:41.452 --> 01:40:43.261
Okay.

01:40:45.039 --> 01:40:47.140
Thank you, Marilyn.

01:40:49.001 --> 01:40:50.810
Carol...

01:40:52.337 --> 01:40:54.605
would you like to respond?

01:40:55.549 --> 01:40:57.576
Okay, okay.

01:40:57.676 --> 01:40:59.954
We don't want to force anyone.

01:41:00.054 --> 01:41:01.654
Nell?

01:41:03.932 --> 01:41:05.542
What?

01:41:05.642 --> 01:41:08.462
Would you like to take part?

01:41:08.562 --> 01:41:10.746
What is the question?

01:41:11.690 --> 01:41:13.634
The question is...

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:16.586
why did you become sick?

01:41:24.985 --> 01:41:29.984
First, I got sick and my
husband thought I was crazy...

01:41:30.084 --> 01:41:32.602
and then he got sick the same way.

01:41:34.379 --> 01:41:37.616
What was happening in your life
around the time that you...

01:41:37.716 --> 01:41:41.194
How were you feeling
when you first got sick?

01:41:46.475 --> 01:41:49.420
I just wanted to get a gun...

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:54.040
and blow off the heads of
everyone who got me like this.

01:41:55.567 --> 01:41:58.137
Nobody out there made you sick.
You know that.

01:41:58.237 --> 01:42:01.306
The only person who can make
you get sick is you, right?

01:42:01.406 --> 01:42:04.768
Whatever the sickness, if our
immune system is damaged...

01:42:04.868 --> 01:42:07.062
it's because we have
allowed it to be...

01:42:07.162 --> 01:42:09.940
through exactly the kind of
anger you're showing us now.

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:12.276
Does that make sense?

01:42:12.376 --> 01:42:14.602
Does anybody have a
problem with that?

01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:20.117
Which is why you need to
remember your affirmations...

01:42:20.217 --> 01:42:23.194
and figure out how to
love Nell a lot more.

01:42:24.221 --> 01:42:26.530
And even Nell's disease.

01:42:28.892 --> 01:42:31.202
And put that gun of yours away.

01:42:38.152 --> 01:42:40.253
Sometimes...

01:42:41.738 --> 01:42:46.342
Sometimes all I see is the
hatred and frailty...

01:42:49.746 --> 01:42:52.232
people's cruelty to one another...

01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:54.767
cruelty to themselves...

01:42:56.545 --> 01:42:58.646
and I realize...

01:43:01.133 --> 01:43:03.025
how lucky I am.

01:43:11.351 --> 01:43:13.452
How blessed.

01:44:08.116 --> 01:44:10.968
- Is that everything?
- I think so.

01:44:12.621 --> 01:44:15.315
Rory, be careful with that.
It's real heavy.

01:44:15.415 --> 01:44:17.067
I have it!

01:44:17.167 --> 01:44:19.486
Rory, don't talk to your
mother in that tone.

01:44:19.586 --> 01:44:21.354
Fine.

01:44:23.257 --> 01:44:26.493
- What time's your flight?
- 7:20.

01:44:26.593 --> 01:44:28.662
Ror, if you really
want to be helpful...

01:44:28.762 --> 01:44:32.031
make sure our stuff's in the
car and we're ready to go.

01:44:33.809 --> 01:44:35.961
- Want me to get that?
- I got it.

01:44:36.061 --> 01:44:37.912
You sure?

01:44:45.779 --> 01:44:48.005
- Whoa. Watch it.
- Whoops.

01:44:48.657 --> 01:44:50.466
You okay?

01:44:58.583 --> 01:45:01.028
You all right?

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:04.364
I think it might be your cologne.

01:45:04.464 --> 01:45:07.233
Honey, I'm not wearing any cologne.

01:45:07.559 --> 01:45:11.737
Maybe in the shirt. I don't know.

01:45:20.314 --> 01:45:24.426
Well, I guess we better get moving
if we're gonna catch the plane.

01:45:24.526 --> 01:45:26.887
You gonna be okay?

01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:30.057
I'm fine. It's just for a short time.

01:45:30.157 --> 01:45:32.184
- I know.
- I'll be fine.

01:45:32.284 --> 01:45:33.968
Okay.

01:45:37.164 --> 01:45:39.723
- Can I hug you?
- Of course.

01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:17.604
So this other guy didn't know
anything was wrong with him either...

01:46:17.704 --> 01:46:20.816
except that whenever
he would go into a mall...

01:46:20.916 --> 01:46:23.443
he would get totally depressed...

01:46:23.543 --> 01:46:27.906
you know, start crying really hard,
and contemplating suicide.

01:46:28.006 --> 01:46:31.368
And then he would step outside,
and he would be fine.

01:46:31.468 --> 01:46:35.372
You know, totally normal.
This would happen every single time.

01:46:35.472 --> 01:46:38.292
- God.
- Yeah.

01:46:38.392 --> 01:46:40.919
- You know what they called him?
- What?

01:46:41.019 --> 01:46:44.788
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. For-mall-dehyde."

01:46:45.219 --> 01:46:46.887
Oh, God.

01:46:47.859 --> 01:46:50.262
- I'm so gullible.
- No, I'm serious.

01:46:50.362 --> 01:46:52.546
This really happened.

01:46:54.032 --> 01:46:57.644
I always forget if it's pasta,
cheese, sauce...

01:46:57.744 --> 01:47:00.272
cheese, pasta...

01:47:00.372 --> 01:47:03.650
or pasta, sauce, cheese...

01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:07.237
pasta, cheese, sauce.

01:47:07.337 --> 01:47:10.615
I think it's pasta...

01:47:10.715 --> 01:47:12.909
pasta, pasta, pasta, cheese...

01:47:13.009 --> 01:47:15.662
- Stop it! Stop it!
- ...pasta, sauce.

01:47:15.762 --> 01:47:18.081
Suddenly all I see...

01:47:18.181 --> 01:47:21.335
all over my hands and my legs are...

01:47:21.435 --> 01:47:24.921
black, horrible sores
all over me, oozing.

01:47:25.021 --> 01:47:27.507
And at first I'm horrified...

01:47:27.607 --> 01:47:30.344
and I'm full of self-pity and anger.

01:47:30.444 --> 01:47:33.138
I'm enraged until I realize...

01:47:33.238 --> 01:47:35.849
Suddenly I look down again,
and I realize...

01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:38.101
that they aren't sores at all...

01:47:38.201 --> 01:47:42.314
but these... black pansies...

01:47:42.414 --> 01:47:46.568
these sort of wilted black pansies
I used to pick when I was a child.

01:47:46.668 --> 01:47:48.820
So in my dream, I remember that.

01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:51.031
And as I pick up...

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:53.283
each wilted flower...

01:47:53.383 --> 01:47:55.702
they would just instantly...

01:47:55.802 --> 01:47:57.861
bloom into beautiful bouquets.

01:47:58.947 --> 01:48:00.207
Every single one.

01:48:00.307 --> 01:48:03.043
- Ending in rejoice.
- That's remarkably clear.

01:48:03.143 --> 01:48:05.003
It's extraordinary.

01:48:05.103 --> 01:48:07.297
Incredible lasagna, by the way, guys.

01:48:07.397 --> 01:48:10.550
- Yeah.
- Great dinner, both of you.

01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:13.553
And you know, it almost
tasted like the real thing.

01:48:13.653 --> 01:48:15.430
To Carol and Chris.

01:48:15.530 --> 01:48:17.840
- To Carol and Chris.
- To Carol and Chris.

01:48:21.786 --> 01:48:25.732
<i>Sweet love's showin'
us a heavenly light</i>

01:48:25.832 --> 01:48:29.236
<i>Never seen such a beautiful sight</i>

01:48:29.336 --> 01:48:33.198
<i>Sweet love glowing on us every night</i>

01:48:33.298 --> 01:48:36.576
<i>I know forever we'll be doing it</i>

01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:40.539
<i>Sweet love's showin'
us a heavenly light</i>

01:48:40.639 --> 01:48:43.959
<i>I never seen such a beautiful sight</i>

01:48:44.059 --> 01:48:48.130
<i>Sweet love glowing on us every night</i>

01:48:48.230 --> 01:48:52.092
<i>I know forever we'll
be doing it right</i>

01:48:52.192 --> 01:48:56.304
<i>Whenever I call you friend</i>

01:48:56.404 --> 01:48:59.766
<i>I believe I've come to understand</i>

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:04.104
<i>Everywhere we are you
and I were meant to be</i>

01:49:04.204 --> 01:49:06.273
<i>Forever and ever</i>

01:49:06.373 --> 01:49:10.902
<i>I think about the times to come</i>

01:49:11.002 --> 01:49:14.114
<i>Knowing I will be the lucky one</i>

01:49:14.214 --> 01:49:16.992
<i>And ever our love will last</i>

01:49:17.092 --> 01:49:22.789
<i>I always want to call you friend</i>

01:49:22.889 --> 01:49:26.918
<i>Sweet love's showin'
us a heavenly light</i>

01:49:27.018 --> 01:49:29.662
<i>Never seen such a beautiful sight</i>

01:49:32.190 --> 01:49:34.468
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

01:49:34.568 --> 01:49:37.512
I've got a little
announcement to make.

01:49:37.612 --> 01:49:41.099
Since it's almost tomorrow...

01:49:41.199 --> 01:49:43.310
and tomorrow happens to be...

01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:46.171
Carol's birthday...

01:49:47.497 --> 01:49:50.650
we have a little surprise for her.

01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:59.701
<i>For she's a jolly good fellow</i>

01:49:59.801 --> 01:50:03.737
<i>And so say all of us</i>

01:50:09.311 --> 01:50:11.004
Speech!

01:50:11.104 --> 01:50:13.590
- Speech!
- Happy birthday, Carol.

01:50:13.690 --> 01:50:16.510
- Speech!
- No, I...

01:50:16.610 --> 01:50:19.304
- Happy birthday, sweetie.
- I...

01:50:19.404 --> 01:50:22.883
- Say something.
- I can't. I've never made a speech before.

01:50:22.983 --> 01:50:27.187
- Please.
- Oh, God.

01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:29.722
I just want to thank
Chris for doing this...

01:50:30.874 --> 01:50:34.319
and everybody here so much.

01:50:34.419 --> 01:50:37.322
It just... You pulled me
through a really hard period.

01:50:37.422 --> 01:50:40.482
Anyway, I couldn't have
done it without you.

01:50:45.221 --> 01:50:47.600
I don't know what I'm saying.

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:52.462
Just that I really hated
myself before I came here...

01:50:52.562 --> 01:50:54.464
and, so...

01:50:54.564 --> 01:50:58.259
I'm trying to see myself hopefully,

01:50:58.485 --> 01:51:01.304
more as I am, more...

01:51:01.404 --> 01:51:03.765
more positive...

01:51:03.865 --> 01:51:06.560
like seeing the pluses.

01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:09.062
Like, I think it's slowly
opening up now.

01:51:09.162 --> 01:51:11.648
People's minds, like...

01:51:11.748 --> 01:51:13.900
educating and, and...

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.169
AIDS and...

01:51:16.836 --> 01:51:19.781
and other types of diseases...

01:51:19.881 --> 01:51:21.783
'cause... 'cause...

01:51:21.883 --> 01:51:24.911
And it is a disease,
'cause it's out there...

01:51:25.011 --> 01:51:28.790
and we just have to be
more aware of it...

01:51:28.890 --> 01:51:32.586
make people aware of it
and, even ourselves...

01:51:32.686 --> 01:51:35.297
like, going...

01:51:35.397 --> 01:51:39.208
reading labels and going
into buildings...

01:51:49.703 --> 01:51:51.229
To Carol.

01:51:51.329 --> 01:51:54.223
To Carol!

01:52:37.876 --> 01:52:40.195
Thank you, Chris...

01:52:40.295 --> 01:52:42.479
for everything.

01:52:43.548 --> 01:52:47.317
- Are you sure you're all right, Carol?
- I'm fine, really.

01:52:49.471 --> 01:52:51.405
Okay.

01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:53.949
<i>Happy birthday</i>

01:52:56.019 --> 01:52:57.786
Thanks.

01:53:01.274 --> 01:53:04.209
- See you tomorrow.
- For sure.

01:53:05.361 --> 01:53:07.504
- Good night.
- Night.

01:54:59.613 --> 01:55:01.278
I love...

01:55:06.316 --> 01:55:08.333
I love you.

01:55:12.363 --> 01:55:14.506
I really love you.

01:55:20.663 --> 01:55:22.556
I love you.
