INTO THE ACTUAL TATTOO.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.035
{\an8}- I HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE INK MASTER

08:56.118 --> 08:57.370
{\an8}BECAUSE I AM VERSATILE.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.622
I HAVE DEFINITELY
NOT SETTLED

08:59.705 --> 09:03.876
ON JUST BEING A GREAT
NEW SCHOOL TATTOO ARTIST.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.921
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT,

09:07.004 --> 09:09.882
SEVEN, SIX, FIVE,

09:09.966 --> 09:11.926
FOUR, THREE, TWO,

09:12.009 --> 09:14.971
ONE, TIME'S UP.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.597
MACHINES DOWN.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.099
NO MORE INK.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.642
- IT TURNED OUT COOL.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.894
- JOSHUA--HE GOT
THE EASIEST CANVAS.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.855
{\an8}IT SEEMS LIKE
A BIT OF A COP-OUT.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.483
- SO, JACKIE.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.152
- YOU REALLY GET
THAT RICH, DARK VALUE.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.446
A LOT OF GOOD USE
OF DARK TO LIGHT SHADING.

09:32.530 --> 09:33.572
AND THE WAY YOU USED
THE TEXTURE OF HIS SKIN

09:33.656 --> 09:37.660
TO REPRESENT WHERE THE SAND IS,
VERY CLEVER.

09:37.743 --> 09:38.744
- ES.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.663
- I THINK YOU DID A GOOD JOB
WITH THE SHADING,

09:40.746 --> 09:42.248
WHERE YOU SHOW THE VALUES
AND YOU DID

09:42.331 --> 09:44.000
THE GHOST SHADING
INSIDE THE FLAMES,

09:44.083 --> 09:45.876
WHICH REALLY IMPROVES
ON THIS.

09:45.960 --> 09:46.544
AND AS THIS HEALS,
IT'LL SOFTEN UP,

09:46.627 --> 09:48.296
AND IT'LL LOOK A LOT BETTER.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.505
- THANKS.

09:49.588 --> 09:50.798
- CHRIS.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.383
- IN THIS DESIGN,
YOU DIDN'T GIVE YOURSELF

09:52.466 --> 09:54.010
A BIG AREA
TO ACTUALLY EXHIBIT

09:54.093 --> 09:55.636
A REAL BIG EXAMPLE OF VALUE.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.264
BUT IN THE BROWN,
IT IS REALLY DARK.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.016
AND IT DOES HAVE
A SMOOTH TRANSITION TO LIGHT,

10:00.099 --> 10:01.559
AND THAT'S GOOD.
- THANK YOU.

10:01.642 --> 10:02.685
{\an8}OH, YAY, FINALLY I GET

10:02.768 --> 10:04.687
{\an8}SOME POSITIVE RESPONSE
FROM THESE DUDES.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.315
HOPEFULLY IT'S THE START
OF A NEW BEGINNING.

10:07.398 --> 10:08.858
- TATU BABY.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.485
- AS FAR AS VALUE GOES,
YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD RANGE

10:11.569 --> 10:13.779
OF DARK BLACK UNDERNEATH
THAT CREST OF THE WING,

10:13.863 --> 10:14.947
FADING OUT INTO THE FEATHERS.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.782
A LOT OF GOOD,
DIFFERENT COLOR VALUES

10:16.866 --> 10:18.659
THROUGHOUT THIS TATTOO--
FROM THE BEAK TO THE HEAD

10:18.743 --> 10:21.829
TO THE NECK TO THE TUFTS
AROUND THE SHOULDERS.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.247
- JASON.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.832
- THE VALUE THAT YOU GOT
IN THIS, THE DARK TO LIGHTS,

10:24.915 --> 10:26.000
YOU HAVE
SOME NICE AREAS

10:26.083 --> 10:27.168
WHERE IT'S GONNA
SOFTEN UP NICELY.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.545
THE SOFT WATER IN THE BOTTOM,
THAT'LL BLEND IN NICELY

10:29.628 --> 10:31.630
INTO THAT SCAR TISSUE
IN THE CENTER.

10:31.714 --> 10:32.715
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.343
- JIME.
- I REALLY LIKE THE PLACEMENT.

10:35.426 --> 10:36.594
I LIKE THE WAY THE JAW
RIDES THAT SCAR.

10:36.677 --> 10:40.264
OVERALL, THE VALUE
THAT YOU GOT OUT OF THAT NOSE--

10:40.348 --> 10:41.265
THE WAY
THAT YOUR FADES GO

10:41.349 --> 10:44.143
FROM WHAT YOUR DARKEST TONE
IS TO NOTHING

10:44.226 --> 10:46.270
IS WHAT WE LOOK FOR
WHEN WE LOOK AT BLACK AND GRAY.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.438
- COOL.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.982
- CRAIG, HOW DID YOU GUYS
COME UP WITH THIS CONCEPT?

10:50.066 --> 10:50.775
- I THOUGHT
THAT IF I COULD SOMEHOW

10:50.858 --> 10:52.902
INCORPORATE THE DOG
BITING ME,

10:52.985 --> 10:54.028
IT'D KIND OF SAVE ME
A LOT OF EXPLAINING.

10:54.111 --> 10:56.864
- I WOULD NEVER KNOW
THERE'S ANY SCAR TISSUE THERE,

10:56.947 --> 10:59.116
BECAUSE WHAT CRAIG DID
WAS ENHANCE IT.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.076
- THE DOG IS WHERE YOU

11:00.159 --> 11:01.952
DISPLAYED YOUR TALENTS
IN THIS CHALLENGE,

11:02.036 --> 11:03.496
USING YOUR LIGHT GRAYS
AND DARK GRAYS AND BLACKS

11:03.579 --> 11:05.831
TO REALLY GIVE THIS
THE VALUE

11:05.915 --> 11:07.750
AND THE RICHNESS THAT--
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.085
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
- THANK YOU.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.586
{\an8}- CRAIG IS DEFINITELY
PROVING TO BE

11:10.669 --> 11:12.088
{\an8}A BIG THREAT
IN THIS COMPETITION.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.215
- JOEY.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.217
- I THINK THE VALUE
REALLY CAME THROUGH IN THIS.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.469
THE NOSE WORKS
WITH THE SCARRING ITSELF,

11:18.552 --> 11:21.013
SO IT TAKES THE EYES
OFF THE SCAR.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.223
- WHAT'S UP, KYLE?

11:22.306 --> 11:23.307
- AS FAR AS THE USE
OF VALUE GOES,

11:23.391 --> 11:25.684
YOU REALLY GOT SOME
SMOOTH TRANSITIONS OF COLOR.

11:25.768 --> 11:26.560
- I LIKE THE WAY YOU USED
THE HOT AND COLD

11:26.644 --> 11:29.355
TO REALLY OFFSET
THE COLOR PALETTE.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.399
IT LOOKS GOOD.
- MADE RICH.

11:31.482 --> 11:32.858
- THE WINGS ARE
A LITTLE BIT DARKER.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.235
I KNOW THEY ARE GONNA
LIGHTEN SOME

11:34.318 --> 11:35.277
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
SOME GRAY IN THERE.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.320
- I THINK YOU COULD'VE SHOWED

11:36.404 --> 11:37.780
A LITTLE MORE TRANSITION THERE.

11:37.863 --> 11:41.617
- JOSHUA, WHY DID YOU SELECT
THIS CANVAS?

11:41.700 --> 11:43.285
- SHE HAD
A PRETTY SIMPLE SCAR,

11:43.369 --> 11:44.870
AND I NEEDED A DAY

11:44.954 --> 11:46.747
WHERE I COULD FEEL RELAXED
AND STRESS-FREE.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.082
- [scoffs]

11:48.165 --> 11:49.625
- YOU HAD THE EASY RIDE,
BUT YOU MADE THE MOST OUT OF IT.

11:49.708 --> 11:52.878
- AMAZING VALUE
OF REPRESENTATION IN THERE,

11:52.962 --> 11:55.089
WITH HOW RICH THIS THING
IS IN THE DARK PARTS

11:55.172 --> 11:57.550
AND HOW SOFT THIS THING IS
IN THE LIGHT PARTS.

11:57.633 --> 11:58.926
PERFECT.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.638
{\an8}- THIS ISN'T GONNA WIN.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.181
{\an8}HE DOESN'T GIVE A [bleep].

12:04.265 --> 12:05.433
{\an8}- UNLESS YOU'RE SHARING
100 GRAND,

12:05.516 --> 12:06.976
{\an8}I GOTTA MAKE SURE
THIS IS SOMETHING I WANT.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.019
- I'M HERE TO WIN
IN ANY WAY I CAN.

12:09.103 --> 12:09.728
- THAT'S [bleep] YOU.

12:15.943 --> 12:18.988
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VALUE,

12:19.071 --> 12:20.030
LIGHT TO DARK, TRANSITION.

12:20.114 --> 12:24.118
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT SEVERELY SCARRED CANVASES.

12:24.201 --> 12:27.538
JASON--HE GOT THE GNARLIEST
SCARRED CANVAS OF THE DAY.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.957
- THE MOST DETAILED PART
OF THE DESIGN

12:30.040 --> 12:31.750
IS ALSO ON THE MOST SCARRED PART
OF THE DESIGN.

12:31.834 --> 12:32.751
- YEAH.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.295
- THAT'S JUST
BAD DECISION MAKING.

12:34.378 --> 12:35.504
- LET'S MOVE ON
TO TATU BABY,

12:35.588 --> 12:36.505
WHO I THOUGHT DID REALLY WELL
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.425
- SHE GAVE US
THE RICH BLACKS,

12:39.508 --> 12:41.177
THE SMOOTH COLOR FADES,

12:41.260 --> 12:42.845
TO REALLY LET THE VALUE
SPEAK FOR ITSELF.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.639
- WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF JOSHUA'S WORK TODAY?

12:45.723 --> 12:48.350
- HE SHOWED REALLY BEAUTIFUL
TEXTURE IN THE FLOWER.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.894
- JOSHUA'S TATTOO
IS BEAUTIFUL,

12:49.977 --> 12:51.770
BUT VERY MINIMAL SCARRING.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.439
DIFFICULTY LEVEL--SOMEHOW
THAT'S GOTTA WEIGH IN THERE.

12:53.522 --> 12:56.025
- LET'S NOT FORGET CRAIG.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.068
HE'S REALLY
COMING ON STRONG.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.153
- THE PORTRAIT OF THE DOG

12:59.236 --> 13:00.529
SHOWED SOME OF THE RICHEST VALUE
TODAY.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.698

WE HAVE A DECISION.

13:02.781 --> 13:05.242
- WE DO.

AND YOU DID A REALLY GOOD JOB
PUTTING IT ON A KNEE,

13:20.382 --> 13:22.384

A DIFFICULT AREA.

NICE TRANSITIONS

13:25.387 --> 13:26.847

16:46.088 --> 16:49.216
{\an8}USING STRICTLY BLACK
AND USING WATER TO MAKE

16:49.299 --> 16:50.300
{\an8}DIFFERENT TONES OF GRAY.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.428
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.269
TATU BABY,
YOU WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.770
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN

17:01.854 --> 17:03.939
ALL OF THE HUMAN CANVASES.

17:04.021 --> 17:05.022
CHOOSE WISELY.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.400
{\an8}- THE ADVANTAGE TO ABLE

17:06.483 --> 17:09.987
{\an8}TO PICK EVERYBODY'S SKULL,
I WANT PEOPLE TO DO GOOD.

17:10.069 --> 17:11.696
{\an8}- I WANT A NEW SCHOOL FEMALE,

17:11.780 --> 17:13.866
{\an8}PIGTAILS, OLD WESTERN STYLE.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.284
{\an8}- HE WANTS IT NEW SCHOOL.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.618
{\an8}I AM LIKE, "DAMN.
THAT'S THE ONE I WANT."

17:17.703 --> 17:19.288
{\an8}- TOMMY.
- HEY, TOMMY.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.539
{\an8}- I'D LIKE
A DAY OF THE DEAD GIRL.

17:20.622 --> 17:24.209
{\an8}I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO IT
WITH YOUR FACE AS THE LIKENESS.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.044
{\an8}- SHAZAM!

17:26.127 --> 17:27.838
{\an8}- WHAT?
[laughs]

17:27.921 --> 17:29.298
HE WANTS ME
AS A DAY OF THE DEAD GIRL.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.550
WOW.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.177
- I WANT A DAY
OF THE DEAD GIRL

17:33.260 --> 17:33.969
WITH HER HAIR
KIND OF LOOKING LIKE

17:34.052 --> 17:36.722
THE AMERICAN FLAG,
LOOKING DOWN

17:36.805 --> 17:38.390
OVER A SOLDIER'S RIFLE,
BOOTS, AND HELMET.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.308
{\an8}- THE WAY SHE TALKS,

17:39.391 --> 17:42.686
{\an8}IT'S LIKE
SHE'S GONNA BE SO HONORABLE

17:42.770 --> 17:44.521
{\an8}AND HAND EVERYBODY
THE BEST CANVAS POSSIBLE.

17:44.605 --> 17:45.606
{\an8}I KNOW SHE'S FULL OF [bleep],

17:45.689 --> 17:48.067
{\an8}AND SHE'S GONNA GIVE ME
THE HARDEST ONE SHE CAN.

17:48.150 --> 17:51.111
{\an8}- THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE
THE TOUGHEST CANVAS.

17:51.195 --> 17:54.281
{\an8}JOSHUA MADE IT EASY FOR ME
TO MAKE THAT CHOICE

17:54.364 --> 17:56.450
{\an8}BECAUSE HE DID IT TO ME.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.327
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

17:58.410 --> 18:01.038
PLEASE READ THE NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.539
- MADE RICH.
- YES.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.333
- JACKIE.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.502
- JOEY.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.712
- JIME.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.631
- I'M GONNA HOOK
THAT [bleep] THING UP.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.466
{\an8}TATU BABY THROWS ME
A [bleep] BONE.

18:12.549 --> 18:13.717
{\an8}THIS ONE IS AWESOME.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.553
I FEEL LIKE
I COULD REALLY START TO SHINE.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.599
- TATU BABY.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.351
- WE GOT THIS.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.019
- TATU BABY
HAS FULL CONTROL

18:24.102 --> 18:25.354
OVER HER SUBJECT MATTER.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.231
{\an8}THE GUY BASICALLY JUST LAID IT
OUT THERE ON THE LINE,

18:27.314 --> 18:30.067
{\an8}"WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO, I JUST
WANT A LIKELINESS OF YOU."

18:30.150 --> 18:31.902
DEFINITELY AN ADVANTAGE,
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

18:31.985 --> 18:35.197
- CHRIS.
- KYLE.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.740
- ES.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.992
- JOSHUA.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.078
- JOSHUA TALKS ABOUT HOW
HE JUST WANTS TO PLAY THE GAME.

18:41.161 --> 18:44.039
{\an8}WELL, HOW DOES IT FEEL
WHEN THE GAME'S PLAYED ON YOU?

18:44.122 --> 18:48.377
{\an8}THE HAIR MADE OUT
AN AMERICAN FLAG.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.586
{\an8}- TATU BABY IS REALLY GOOD

18:49.670 --> 18:50.462
{\an8}AT BEING MALICIOUS
WITH A SMILE.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.631
- JASON.

18:52.714 --> 18:53.674
- CRAIG.

18:53.757 --> 18:54.883
- REMEMBER, ARTISTS,

18:54.967 --> 18:57.261
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

18:57.344 --> 18:59.179
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE

18:59.263 --> 19:01.557
ON THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST

19:01.640 --> 19:03.809
AND PUT ONE ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

19:03.892 --> 19:06.019
TOMORROW, YOU'LL HAVE
SIX HOURS TO COMPLETE

19:06.103 --> 19:07.729
YOUR BLACK AND GRAY
DAY OF THE DEAD TATTOO.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.731
BASED ON YOUR WORK,

19:09.815 --> 19:12.526
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.319
{\an8}- DAY OF THE DEAD TATTOOS

19:14.403 --> 19:17.239
{\an8}TYPICALLY ARE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
THAT WEAR FACE PAINT,

19:17.322 --> 19:18.991
{\an8}THAT MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE SKULLS.
- ENJOY.

19:19.074 --> 19:21.994
- WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SMOOTH TRANSITIONS

19:22.077 --> 19:22.953
FROM HEAVY BLACKS
TO WHERE IT GOES

19:23.036 --> 19:25.414
ALL THE WAY
TO GRAY TO NOTHING

19:25.497 --> 19:27.332
AND GIVES
A NICE USE OF VALUE

19:27.416 --> 19:30.085
IN ALL DIFFERENT KINDS
OF AREAS ON THE FACE.

19:30.168 --> 19:32.880
- I KIND OF WANT
A DAY OF THE DEAD GIRL.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.590
I WANT HER TO HAVE
AN ETHNIC LOOK TO HER.

19:34.673 --> 19:35.757
WITH HER HAIR, IT SHOULD BE
LIKE AN AMERICAN FLAG.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.092
AND I KIND OF WANT HER LOOKING

19:37.175 --> 19:39.344
OVER THE RIFLE STUCK
IN BETWEEN THE BOOTS

19:39.428 --> 19:41.430
WITH THE HELMET ON THE TOP,
WITH THE DOG TAGS.

19:41.513 --> 19:44.141
SMOKE, KIND OF LIKE FIRE, LIKE
A BATTLEFIELD-TYPE ENVIRONMENT.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.225
- MM-HMM, I LIKE THAT, MAN.
I LIKE THAT.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.226
- LIKE, SMOKE AND EVERYTHING.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.436
{\an8}- I NEVER LISTEN
TO SOMEBODY'S IDEA

19:47.519 --> 19:48.729
{\an8}AND SAY,
"THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO."

19:48.812 --> 19:49.897
{\an8}I LISTEN TO THE IDEA
AND SAY,

19:49.980 --> 19:51.648
{\an8}"WHAT IS IT
THAT THEY REALLY WANT?"

19:51.732 --> 19:54.568
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO UNKNOWINGLY SCREW YOURSELF.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.194
I'D LOVE TO TATTOO YOU,
BUT I WANT IT TO BE

19:56.278 --> 19:58.280
A VERY CLEAR,
PRECISE MESSAGE.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.281
I'M SO THANKFUL

19:59.364 --> 20:00.449
THAT I'M COMING
TO THIS COMPETITION

20:00.532 --> 20:01.742
WITH THE SKILL SET
THAT I HAVE

20:01.825 --> 20:03.243
AND MY ABILITY TO TALK TO PEOPLE
AND CONNECT WITH THEM.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.162
- AS FAR AS THE HAIR MAYBE
TURNING TO MAKE A FLAG,

20:05.245 --> 20:06.371
MAYBE THAT
I CAN COMPROMISE ON.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.581
- I THINK
THAT MIGHT BE TOO MUCH.

20:07.664 --> 20:08.415
- YEAH, I CAN COMPROMISE
ON THAT A LITTLE BIT.

20:08.498 --> 20:11.168
- OKAY, SO LET'S DO THAT.
- OKAY.

20:11.251 --> 20:12.878
- A LUCHADOR MASK,

20:12.961 --> 20:15.047
IS IT FINE THAT WE HAVE
LIKE, THE HALF MASK?

20:15.130 --> 20:16.465
- YEAH. NO, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA WORK.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.967
- I HAVE TO GET DAY OF THE DEAD
IN HERE SOMEHOW TOO.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.969
{\an8}MY CANVAS DOESN'T WANT A DAY
OF THE DEAD SKULL AT ALL.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.138
HE WANTS
ARABIAN LUCHADOR MASK.

20:23.221 --> 20:25.432
THIS ISN'T GONNA WIN
THIS CHALLENGE.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.225
- I WANT TO WALK OUT OF HERE
WITH SOMETHING THAT,

20:27.309 --> 20:28.810
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA WANT
TO SHOW OFF TO EVERYBODY.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.771
- I WANT TO WIN $100,000.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.898
HE DOESN'T GIVE A [bleep]

20:32.981 --> 20:34.066
ABOUT MY STANDING
INSIDE THIS COMPETITION.

20:34.149 --> 20:35.317
- UNLESS YOU'RE SHARING
100 GRAND,

20:35.400 --> 20:37.611
I GOTTA MAKE SURE
THIS IS SOMETHING I WANT.

20:37.694 --> 20:38.570
[chuckles]

20:38.654 --> 20:40.197
- HE IS NOT FLEXIBLE,
AND I DO NOT WANT

20:40.280 --> 20:45.619
TO GO HOME BECAUSE A CANVAS
DOESN'T AGREE WITH ME.

20:49.247 --> 20:51.875
- BLACK AND GRAY
DAY OF THE DEAD TATTOO.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.377
YOU KNOW, I'M [bleep] NERVOUS.

20:53.460 --> 20:57.506
I'M A NEW SCHOOL ARTIST,
AND I'M A COLOR SPECIALIST,

20:57.589 --> 20:59.216
SO I NEVER DO BLACK AND GRAY.

20:59.299 --> 20:59.591
- YO, THIS IS WHAT
YOU'RE DOING RIGHT HERE?

20:59.675 --> 21:01.718
- YEAH.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.303
I DON'T REALLY DO
BLACK AND GRAY MUCH.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.973
I'M GONNA SET UP A WHOLE BUNCH
OF DIFFERENT SHADES OF GRAY.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.225
- BETWEEN ME AND CRAIG,
WE'RE BOTH "NEW SCHOOL ARTISTS,"

21:08.308 --> 21:11.520
BUT I AM WAY BETTER
AT BLACK AND GRAY,

21:11.603 --> 21:12.479
AND I'M GONNA COME UP ON TOP
ON THIS ONE.

21:12.562 --> 21:14.606
I THINK YOU DEFINITELY SET
THE BAR HIGH

21:14.690 --> 21:15.691
FOR YOURSELF TODAY THOUGH.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.276
- I'M NOT GOING HOME.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.197
- ARTISTS, YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO CREATE

21:22.280 --> 21:23.991
A BLACK AND GRAY
DAY OF THE DEAD TATTOO,

21:24.074 --> 21:26.952
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.329
- [claps]
- LET'S GO.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.374
{\an8}- THE USE OF VALUE ON A TATTOO

21:32.457 --> 21:34.209
{\an8}IS USING YOUR DARK TONES
AND LIGHT TONES

21:34.292 --> 21:36.753
{\an8}AND TRANSITION
IN BETWEEN THE TWO.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.088
- SICK.

21:38.171 --> 21:40.757
- THESE ARE GREAT DESIGNS
TO EXECUTE VALUE,

21:40.841 --> 21:41.842
AND YOU HAVE TO SHOW
THE VALUES IN THAT FACE

21:41.925 --> 21:44.052
TO MAKE THAT FACE LOOK ROUND

21:44.136 --> 21:45.470
INSTEAD OF IT
LOOK LIKE A FLAT PAINTING.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.890
- PERFECTION.
- [laughs]

21:48.974 --> 21:51.226
- MY CANVAS SEES THE DRAWING.

21:51.309 --> 21:53.186
{\an8}HE'S NOT ALL SUPER EXCITED
ABOUT IT.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.062
- SO WE'RE GOING WITH
THE FULL-SHAPED JAW LIKE THAT.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.063
YOU'RE NOT GONNA EXTEND IT DOWN

21:55.147 --> 21:57.649
LIKE WE DID LAST NIGHT?
- NO.

21:57.733 --> 22:00.110
I'M NOT REALLY GIVING HIM
ANY ROOM TO BACK OUT OF IT,

22:00.193 --> 22:02.195
SO HE'S GONNA LET ME PUT IT
ON HIM AND GO.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.698
- SO YOU DOING, LIKE, A SKULL?
- YEAH.

22:04.781 --> 22:05.699
- I'M GUESSING
IT'S DAY OF THE DEAD.

22:05.782 --> 22:07.075
THERE WAS A LOT OF TIME SPENT
DESIGNING THIS

22:07.159 --> 22:09.661
AND NOT A LOT OF TIME
RESEARCHING IT.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.956
HOPEFULLY THEY'RE IMPRESSED
BY MY VALUE.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.416
- IT'S IN YOUR HANDS NOW.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.169
- AND THE FUN PART BEGINS.

22:22.340 --> 22:24.301
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- I LOVE IT.

22:24.384 --> 22:25.218
- GOOD.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.553
{\an8}- THE CANVAS
THAT I GOT ACTUALLY

22:26.636 --> 22:28.388
{\an8}LET ME DRAW MY OWN STYLE
OF ARTWORK.

22:28.472 --> 22:31.475
I'M FINALLY DOING
A NEW SCHOOL TATTOO.

22:31.558 --> 22:32.809
- I LIKE HER TATTOO TOO.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.770
THAT'S A GOOD TOUCH.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.396
BANGING THIS OUT.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.355
[tattoo machine buzzing]

22:37.439 --> 22:38.815
- I DON'T REALLY
GET MUCH OPPORTUNITY

22:38.899 --> 22:40.984
TO DO BLACK AND GRAY

22:41.068 --> 22:42.569
'CAUSE PEOPLE SEE
BRIGHT COLORS.

22:42.652 --> 22:44.529
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE ALWAYS
ASKING ME TO DO.

22:44.613 --> 22:45.447
{\an8}- WHEN WE SAY "BLACK AND GRAY,"
WE'RE LOOKING

22:45.530 --> 22:47.949
{\an8}LITERALLY FOR SOMEBODY
TO TAKE BLACK INK,

22:48.033 --> 22:49.576
{\an8}WATER IT DOWN,
AND ONLY USE THAT.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.370
WALKING INTO CRAIG'S ROOM,
YOU CAN TELL HE'S MIXED

22:52.454 --> 22:54.498
HIS WHITE INTO HIS BLACK
AND MADE GRAY.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.000
THAT'S A NO-NO
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.127
THAT'S OPAQUE GRAY.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.212
- IT LOOKS
LIKE THERE'S WHITE IN THERE.

23:00.295 --> 23:02.339
- OH, YEAH, HE WAS--
- 100%.

23:02.422 --> 23:03.715
- HE'S PACKING COLOR

23:03.799 --> 23:06.760
INSTEAD OF DARK TO LIGHT,
FADE.

23:06.843 --> 23:08.470
- TO ME, BLACK AND GRAY,

23:08.553 --> 23:09.805
YOU GOT TO, LIKE,
SHAPE IT.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.516
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T JUST [bleep]
COLOR A SECTION.

23:12.599 --> 23:13.934
LIKE, YOU GOT TO SCULPT IT.

23:14.017 --> 23:16.645
- CRAIG DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
HOW TO DO BLACK AND GRAY.

23:16.728 --> 23:17.771
THIS IS A SHOCK TO ME.

23:17.854 --> 23:21.691
IT'S DEFINITELY
ANOTHER ONE-TRICK PONY SCENARIO.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.735
- THREE HOURS DOWN,
THREE TO GO.

23:23.819 --> 23:29.491
[tattoo machines buzzing]

23:29.574 --> 23:31.576
{\an8}- INSTEAD OF JUST DOING THE FACE
PAINTED LIKE A SKULL,

23:31.660 --> 23:36.039
I ACTUALLY WANNA INCLUDE
A REAL SKULL JAWBONE.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.082
CAN YOU RECOGNIZE
WHO THAT IS?

23:37.165 --> 23:38.625
- I DO.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.418
- I'M STARTING TO FEEL
A TON OF PRESSURE.

23:40.502 --> 23:43.296
I PUT A CERTAIN STANDARD
FOR MYSELF.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.881
AND IF I DON'T MEET
THAT STANDARD,

23:44.965 --> 23:46.258
I'M GONNA GET HIT
PRETTY HARD.

23:46.341 --> 23:49.177
{\an8}- I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY LOVES
TATU BABY,

23:49.261 --> 23:50.554
{\an8}BUT IF SHE HAS A BAD DAY,
SHE'S GONNA DO A [bleep] TATTOO,

23:50.637 --> 23:51.179
{\an8}AND THAT'S
WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.015
HER DESIGN IS JUST CRAPPY.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.142
AND SHE WAS TATTOOING
DAY OF THE DEAD.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.686
LIKE, THAT'S WHAT'S
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD AT.

23:57.769 --> 24:00.522
[rock music]

24:00.605 --> 24:02.691
I DEFINITELY THINK
IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL, MAN.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.109
I THINK IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD
ON YOUR SKIN, MAN.

24:04.192 --> 24:06.111
I THINK TATU BABY TRIED
TO SCREW ME WITH THIS PIECE,

24:06.194 --> 24:08.613
BUT WHEN I COME OUT
WITH A BEAUTIFUL TATTOO,

24:08.697 --> 24:08.989
IT'S JUST GONNA MAKE ME
LOOK BETTER.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.032
HEY, BABY.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.033
HE SAID HE DOESN'T
APPRECIATE BEING A PAWN

24:12.117 --> 24:14.494
IN YOUR DIABOLIC SCHEME.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.538
SHE'S LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO THAT."

24:16.621 --> 24:17.414
- JOSHUA'S BACKGROUND
MAKES NO SENSE.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.124
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE

ARE BIG ON

24:22.377 --> 24:23.295

A DAMN GOOD BACKGROUND.

DO SOMETHING SIMPLE,

30:47.929 --> 30:49.305
MAKE IT PERFECT.

MORE TIME ON THIS TATTOO,

GIVEN IT THE VALUE
THAT IT NEEDS.

30:52.642 --> 30:54.185
ESPECIALLY IN THE PITS
OF THE ROSE,

30:54.269 --> 30:55.395
YOU COULD'VE GONE
A LITTLE DARKER

30:55.478 --> 30:57.438
AND LET IT COME OUT
TO THAT GRAY SHADING,

30:57.522 --> 30:58.439
INSTEAD OF JUST LOOKING
LIKE AN OUTLINE

30:58.523 --> 31:00.608
WITH GRAY SHADING IN IT.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.986
- I WANTED TO HAVE A CONTRAST,
LIGHT AND DARK.

31:03.069 --> 31:05.196
SO I THINK IF I WOULD'VE MADE
THAT ROSE TOO DARK,

31:05.280 --> 31:06.698
YOU GUYS WOULD'VE TOLD ME THAT--
- I'M NOT SAYING YOU NEED

31:06.781 --> 31:08.283
TO MAKE THAT ROSE DARKER.

31:08.366 --> 31:09.867

TO MAKE THE TRANSITION

31:09.951 --> 31:13.121
LOOK A LOT SMOOTHER.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.164
- CRAIG.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.544
- WHEN I LOOK AT THIS TATTOO,
THE FIRST THING I THINK IS,

31:19.627 --> 31:20.461
WHAT HAPPENED?

31:20.545 --> 31:22.422
THE REASON WE'RE JUDGING VALUE

31:22.505 --> 31:23.298
ON BLACK AND GRAY

31:23.381 --> 31:25.633
IS WE WANT TO SEE
THAT TRANSITION.

31:25.717 --> 31:26.634
AND THE WAY
YOU DID YOUR GRAYS,

31:26.718 --> 31:28.720
IT'S MORE LIKE
A PAINT BY NUMBER.

31:28.803 --> 31:29.679

GRAY HERE,

31:29.762 --> 31:31.681
AND SOLID THAT GRAY COLOR HERE.

31:31.764 --> 31:32.724

EVERYBODY HAS DEVELOPED

31:32.807 --> 31:35.226
DIFFERENT BLACK AND GRAY
TECHNIQUES.

31:35.310 --> 31:38.104
AND MINE'S ALWAYS INCLUDED
THE ACTUAL COLOR GRAY.

31:38.187 --> 31:40.481
- WELL, THAT'S WHY IMMEDIATELY,
YOU'RE IN THE BOTTOM.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.483
I SAID,
"DON'T USE OPAQUE GRAY."

31:42.567 --> 31:43.860
SO IT COULD BE
THE NICEST TATTOO OF THE DAY,

31:43.943 --> 31:44.986
IT'S STILL
IN THE BOTTOM.

31:45.069 --> 31:47.572
THE WHOLE POINT
OF NOT USING OPAQUE GRAY

31:47.655 --> 31:49.282
IS TO REALLY SEE
IF YOU CAN DO BLACK AND GRAY.

31:49.365 --> 31:50.408
BUT YOU JUST DIDN'T GIVE US

31:50.491 --> 31:54.037
ANYTHING TO LOOK AT
AS FAR AS VALUE GOES.

BECAUSE YOU JUST CHOSE

40:01.732 --> 40:03.317
AN INCREDIBLY DARK PALETTE.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.027
THAT HURT YOU.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.404
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:09.406 --> 40:11.075
- I FELL SHORT
FROM THE BEGINNING.

40:11.158 --> 40:13.744
THE OVERWHELMING WANT
TO DO WELL,

40:13.828 --> 40:14.662
I THINK,
IS WHAT SCREWED ME OVER.

40:14.745 --> 40:18.249
I AM BETTER
THAN WHAT I EXHIBIT HERE.

40:18.332 --> 40:20.543
THAT'S BULL[bleep].

narrator: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:27.925 --> 40:30.177
[growling]
- THAT TIGER'S SCARING ME, MAN.

40:30.261 --> 40:33.806
- TODAY, YOUR CANVAS IS
THE HUMAN BODY.

40:33.889 --> 40:34.974
[bird squawks]

40:35.057 --> 40:35.641
- HOW'D YOU GET
THE STENCIL ON?

40:35.724 --> 40:37.434
- IT WAS IN THE [bleep] ASS.

40:37.518 --> 40:38.185
- I JUST PUSHED IT IN THE CRACK.
- WOW.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.311
- THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT?

40:39.395 --> 40:41.063
- IT'S REALLY STRANGE
TO BE BULLIED

40:41.147 --> 40:43.482
BY MEN IN THEIR 40s.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.025
- ME COMING HERE TWICE,

40:45.109 --> 40:46.026
IT'S JUST SO MUCH WEIGHT
ON MY SHOULDERS.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.528
I'M JUST NOT NAILING IT.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.531
I'M EMBARRASSING MYSELF.
- YOU'RE WAY OFF.

40:50.614 --> 40:51.115
- IT'S NOT REALLY THE WAY
THIS COMPETITION

40:51.198 --> 40:53.075
IS SUPPOSED TO GO DOWN.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.411
- DON'T WASTE
MY OR YOUR TIME.
