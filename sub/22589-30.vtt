<i>NARRATOR".
When last we left our brave boys...</i>

00:11.888 --> 00:15.934
<i>...they were encased by Catwoman
in a giant echo chamber...</i>

00:16.100 --> 00:22.357
<i>...where the drip-drip-drop of</i> a <i>faucet
was magnified 10 million times.</i>

00:24.150 --> 00:26.361
<i>If they don't find some solution...</i>

00:26.569 --> 00:29.405
<i>...their magnificent minds
will be reduced to oatmeal...</i>

00:29.614 --> 00:32.951
<i>...thereby rendering them useless
for a great many things.</i>

00:33.493 --> 00:37.914
<i>Stay glued to your seat.
The worst is yet to come.</i>

02:01.956 --> 02:03.625
Robin.

02:06.336 --> 02:09.213
Every room has its sympathetic vibration.

02:09.422 --> 02:13.343
A note that will shatter glass
like the great Caruso did with his voice.

02:13.551 --> 02:19.223
The note for this room
should be F-sharp above high C.

02:45.124 --> 02:46.167
Wow.

02:46.334 --> 02:49.379
- I think I'll be hard of hearing for a while.
-What?

02:49.587 --> 02:53.216
I said, "Wow,
I think I'll be hard of hearing for a while."

02:53.424 --> 02:55.551
You'll have to speak a little louder, Robin.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.805
I think I'll be hard of hearing for a while.

02:59.263 --> 03:00.306
Whew.

03:05.144 --> 03:06.771
- Robin.
-No, Belgoody.

03:06.979 --> 03:09.482
Call Chief O'Hara
and have him pick this bounder up.

03:09.691 --> 03:10.733
Right, Batman.

03:10.942 --> 03:13.236
All right, Belgoody, tell me everything.

03:13.736 --> 03:18.282
Every--? Well, I was born in Youngstown
of poor but honest parents.

03:18.491 --> 03:21.202
Come off it, Belgoody.
You're pulling my boot.

03:21.411 --> 03:24.163
- What's Catwoman's plan?
-Hm-hm.

03:24.330 --> 03:28.668
You're too late, Batman. You're too late.
Because right at this very moment in history...

03:28.876 --> 03:32.588
...Catwoman is stealing the voices
of Chad and Jeremy at the Policeman's Ball.

03:32.797 --> 03:34.048
Their voices?

03:34.507 --> 03:35.842
So that's it.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.552
What a fiendish plan.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.388
Chief O'Hara and his men will be right over.

03:40.596 --> 03:43.182
We must get to Gotham City Town Hall
immediately, Robin.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.643
Let's tie him up quickly.

03:51.274 --> 03:54.986
<i>NARRATOR". And at Gotham City Town Hall
on the other side of town...</i>

03:55.194 --> 03:58.322
<i>...the joint is really jumping.</i>

04:00.616 --> 04:04.871
And now here they are,
the music world's dynamic duo...

04:05.079 --> 04:06.914
...Chad and Jeremy.

04:24.140 --> 04:30.897
<i>Sweet, soft summer nights</i>

04:32.231 --> 04:35.151
<i>Dancing shadows</i>

04:35.318 --> 04:38.154
Are your see-in-the-dark glasses in order,
Meanie, Miney, Moe'?

04:38.321 --> 04:39.447
- You bet.
-They sure are.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.324
Ready to go.

04:41.866 --> 04:44.285
<i>You came</i>

04:44.952 --> 04:49.624
<i>For me to follow</i>

04:49.791 --> 04:52.919
<i>And we kissed</i>

04:53.628 --> 04:58.341
<i>On distant shores</i>

04:59.717 --> 05:06.641
<i>Long, quiet hours of play</i>

05:07.350 --> 05:11.687
<i>Sounds of tomorrow</i>

05:12.188 --> 05:14.732
Let's get them.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.319
<i>Love came</i>

05:30.623 --> 05:32.667
You said they couldn't get away, Catwoman.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.877
And yet they did. And so will we.

05:39.048 --> 05:40.716
I can't see, Batman.

05:40.925 --> 05:43.886
Neither can I, Robin.
But then again, neither can they.

05:44.095 --> 05:45.513
Oh, yes, we can.

05:45.721 --> 05:49.851
Cats can always see in the dark,
especially with these glasses.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.270
Ha-ha-ha! Come on, kittens.

05:52.478 --> 05:54.814
We've done it!

05:55.606 --> 05:59.610
- Let's go after them, Batman.
-No, Robin. I'm afraid it's too late.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.282
We must stay here and restore order.

06:04.490 --> 06:07.910
With 5000 screaming teenagers,
someone is liable to get hurt.

06:08.119 --> 06:11.038
Citizens. Citizens.

06:11.247 --> 06:12.707
Hi, kids.

06:15.084 --> 06:16.878
<i>NARRATOR".
And on the following morning...</i>

06:17.086 --> 06:21.799
<i>...two special guests appear
on the</i> Allan <i>Stevens television show.</i>

06:21.966 --> 06:26.137
- Now, you were saying--
- As I was saying, America must have faith...

06:26.345 --> 06:30.016
...that the law will recover the voices
of Chad and Jeremy.

06:30.224 --> 06:34.437
I understand millions of the world's teenagers
are in mourning since last night's tragedy.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.814
Yes, that's quite true, Mr. Stevens.

06:37.023 --> 06:40.985
But on the plus side,
millions of parents are delighted.

06:41.193 --> 06:44.822
Speaking as an average, ordinary, red-blooded,
typical American teenager...

06:44.989 --> 06:47.366
...this is one of the worst things
that could have happened.

06:47.533 --> 06:51.787
Fans, you have our assurance
that Catwoman will be captured...

06:51.996 --> 06:55.207
...and that the voices of Chad and Jeremy
will be restored...

06:55.416 --> 06:58.252
...before another sun sets on Gotham City.

06:58.961 --> 07:02.006
The sun also rises, smarty-tights.

07:02.214 --> 07:05.801
Keep the audience covered. If anyone moves,
hit them with a sonic beam blast.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.678
- Crush them, Batman.
-Hold it, Robin.

07:07.887 --> 07:10.848
They appear to be desperate.
They might fire on the audience.

07:11.057 --> 07:15.102
You bet your baby blue eyes we would.

07:15.770 --> 07:18.940
We'll continue with this tense scene
in just a moment, but first--

07:23.069 --> 07:24.946
And now, right back to you, Catwoman.

07:25.154 --> 07:26.739
What is it you want, Catwoman?

07:27.156 --> 07:29.367
Eight million pounds
for the return of their voices.

07:29.742 --> 07:31.452
Eight million pounds of what?
Chicken fat?

07:33.663 --> 07:34.789
Sorry I asked.

07:34.997 --> 07:38.250
It comes to a grand total
of 22,400,000 American dollars...

07:38.417 --> 07:40.628
...and I want it fast.

07:40.836 --> 07:44.256
How do we know you really have their voices
and will return them?

07:44.632 --> 07:50.638
<i>Sweet, soft summer nights</i>

07:51.806 --> 07:53.015
But that's impossible.

07:53.224 --> 07:55.518
Nobody will pay that much money
for those voices.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.019
England will.

07:57.228 --> 08:01.607
Because England swings like a pendulum do.
Or does.

08:01.816 --> 08:03.150
England?

08:03.359 --> 08:06.070
Of all the preposterous plans.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.531
You can't hold up an entire country.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.282
Wanna bet?

08:10.491 --> 08:14.745
Chad and Jeremy pay so much income tax
to their native land, that if it were to stop...

08:14.954 --> 08:18.416
...the whole empire might crumble
and the British pound would be deflated.

08:18.874 --> 08:21.377
And once that happens...

08:21.585 --> 08:24.964
...the entire economic structure of the world
would collapse.

08:25.131 --> 08:27.758
- How dastardly.
-All right, you've heard my deal.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.720
You got until tomorrow noon
to come up with the scratch.

08:30.886 --> 08:35.975
If not,
I'll turn my voice-eraser loose on everyone.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.769
Now, just a darn minute here.
You can't come in here and thre--

08:47.194 --> 08:48.446
Come on, kittens.

08:48.821 --> 08:50.740
Let's shake a paw.

08:50.948 --> 08:53.826
The sneeze bomb ought to keep you busy
for a while.

09:18.893 --> 09:22.396
Ah. Batman and Robin.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.857
Ah, welcome to my humble office.

09:25.066 --> 09:28.152
I am Sir Sterling Habits.
How do you do?

09:28.360 --> 09:30.529
And how do you do? Heh.

09:30.696 --> 09:33.240
And what brings you here
at such an early hour of the morning?

09:33.407 --> 09:38.370
By this time, you're aware of the serious tragedy
affecting your country's most popular export.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.373
Have we stopped making
those small sports oars?

09:41.791 --> 09:43.626
We're referring to Chad and Jeremy.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.669
Oh, yes, those blighters. Hm.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.671
Can't understand a word they say.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.466
Why can't the English learn to speak?

09:50.883 --> 09:53.761
Have you consulted your government
about the ransom demands?

09:54.095 --> 09:57.139
Oh, yes, indeed.
Parliament has been overtime on it.

09:57.348 --> 09:59.475
- And?
-Well...

09:59.683 --> 10:03.479
...I'm expecting a telephone call from them
at any moment now.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.236
Hello?

10:10.444 --> 10:11.987
Oh, Harold.

10:12.196 --> 10:14.490
How are you?

10:14.698 --> 10:17.576
Yes. Uh-huh, quite.

10:17.743 --> 10:20.037
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.039
You're quite sure?

10:22.206 --> 10:23.290
Ah, hm.

10:23.457 --> 10:27.378
Well, thank you very much indeed. Pip-pip.

10:27.586 --> 10:31.632
Well, that was them,
or should I say "they."

10:31.841 --> 10:33.467
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.303
They will not accede
to Catwoman's demands.

10:36.679 --> 10:41.308
Their feelings about Chad and Jeremy are:
millions for their records...

10:41.475 --> 10:43.352
...not a cent for their ransom.

10:44.854 --> 10:48.357
- Yes. Well, thank you, Sir Sterling.
-Not at all.

10:51.694 --> 10:52.903
Yes, what is it, Rhett?

10:53.112 --> 10:57.074
Begging your pardon, sir, but a large crowd
have gathered outside the consulate...

10:57.283 --> 11:00.536
...having heard the Dynamic Duo are here.

11:00.744 --> 11:04.999
I fear at this moment, time's too precious
to spend with our admirers.

11:05.207 --> 11:06.375
We must get cracking.

11:06.584 --> 11:10.045
L-- I'm afraid they have all entrances covered,
sir.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.048
To the window, Robin. Cheerio, Sir Sterling.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.693
Don Ho, what are you doing here?

11:32.902 --> 11:35.613
Well, I came back to get some land we lost
back in Hawaii.

11:35.821 --> 11:38.449
And to do a little singing
here in Gotham City, I hope.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.951
Well, I brought
my most important prop along.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.580
It's gotten me
as far as your Batropes have gotten you.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.249
Yeah, I think I'll introduce Batropes
in Hawaii.

11:47.458 --> 11:49.251
Pick coconuts more easy that way.

11:49.460 --> 11:52.296
I'd like to sit here
and chat with you all day, Don, but...

11:52.504 --> 11:54.840
The surfs coming up
and we gotta catch a big one.

11:55.049 --> 11:57.176
Okay, fellas, I understand. Aloha.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.929
Aloha.

12:06.477 --> 12:09.521
All of our men are out there in the field,
Batman...

12:09.730 --> 12:11.732
...but they're not making a bit of headway.

12:11.941 --> 12:15.194
Poor Commissioner Gordon
is still without his voice.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.488
I think she's got us licked.

12:17.696 --> 12:20.658
The game is never over
until the last out is made, chief.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.326
Never say die.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.995
We've had some dark moments in the past,
haven't we?

12:25.204 --> 12:27.414
- Yes, I know, but this--
-Fear not.

12:27.623 --> 12:31.293
The criminal always makes one mistake.
I'm sure she did too.

12:31.502 --> 12:33.921
There's no such thing as the perfect crime.

12:34.129 --> 12:37.383
Well, I, for one, can't think
of a single mistake she made.

12:37.591 --> 12:40.135
She even had the audacity to phone me...

12:40.302 --> 12:42.888
...right here in Commissioner Gordon's office
this morning.

12:43.055 --> 12:45.683
- You remember anything she said, chief?
-Better than that.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.477
I tape-recorded most of the conversation.

12:48.686 --> 12:50.354
Sound thinking.

12:50.562 --> 12:53.691
- Holy resourcefulness.
-I couldn't have put it better myself, Robin.

12:53.899 --> 12:57.361
It's no wonder you've risen
to the top of your department, Chief O'Hara.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.198
<i>Chief y, what I want is money.</i>

13:01.407 --> 13:04.493
<i>You got four hours before I start using
my voice-eraser on everyone.</i>

13:04.660 --> 13:08.622
<i>Today Gotham City, tomorrow the world.</i>

13:08.831 --> 13:11.208
The gall of that woman.

13:11.417 --> 13:14.920
Do you mind if I take this with me,
Commissioner Gordon?

13:15.129 --> 13:18.007
"Not at all. But Why?"

13:18.215 --> 13:21.051
I heard a strange noise in the background.

13:21.260 --> 13:25.139
We might just be able to identify it
on the Bat-sound Analyzer.

13:25.347 --> 13:28.642
Courage. We'll have your voice back
before you can say "Jack Robinson."

13:28.809 --> 13:31.228
Come on, Robin. There's not much time.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.941
Think it'll work, Batman?

13:36.150 --> 13:39.528
It has to work, Robin. The world's at stake.

13:41.030 --> 13:44.450
This will determine
if that sound in the background...

13:44.658 --> 13:47.703
...is something unique and traceable.

13:47.911 --> 13:50.372
- Batman, there's something I don't understand.
-Yes?

13:50.581 --> 13:53.709
I realize that losing the power of speech
is an awful thing...

13:53.917 --> 13:57.171
...but why do you feel
that the whole world's at stake?

13:57.713 --> 13:59.131
Simple.

13:59.340 --> 14:03.344
- If we couldn't talk, there'd be no telephones.
-Oh.

14:03.552 --> 14:07.556
You see, there are millions of people
who use telephones in business every day.

14:07.765 --> 14:11.727
Now they'd have to meet their clients
face-to-face.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.103
Oh.

14:13.270 --> 14:16.732
That would cause
enormous traffic problems.

14:16.940 --> 14:20.652
Further, all the people who work
for the world's phone companies...

14:20.861 --> 14:23.155
...would lose their jobs.

14:23.697 --> 14:29.328
There'd be no such thing as radio,
television and movies would go silent.

14:29.495 --> 14:32.331
- Oh.
-There's a whole host of ramifications.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.249
And Catwoman can do all that?

14:34.458 --> 14:36.085
If we let her.

14:36.293 --> 14:39.755
Now let's see what that noise
in the background is.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.550
"Three hair dryers."

14:43.759 --> 14:45.052
Hair dryers?

14:45.260 --> 14:46.845
If I remember correctly, Robin...

14:47.054 --> 14:51.225
...there are over 2000 beauty salons
in Gotham City.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.394
There's just not enough time, unless...

14:53.602 --> 14:54.686
Unless what, Batman?

14:54.895 --> 14:59.942
Unless the effects of the voice-eraser wear off
after a while.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.736
If that's true, Robin,
we don't have to worry at all.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.280
- Gosh, Batman, I hope so.
-You go topside, Robin...

15:05.489 --> 15:09.535
...and see if Chad and Jeremy
have recovered their voices. I'll push on here.

15:09.743 --> 15:10.786
Aye, aye, sir.

15:20.129 --> 15:22.548
- Any luck, Alfred?
-I'm afraid not, Master Dick.

15:22.756 --> 15:25.426
Your aunt and I have tried
every remedy we can think of...

15:25.592 --> 15:31.390
...but, uh, it appears that Chad and Jeremy
may well have been stilled forever.

15:33.183 --> 15:37.187
It may not be long before we're all in the same
condition. There must be some way out.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.528
What is it, Alfred?

15:44.736 --> 15:48.240
It seems that they want to go out
to get their hair done.

15:48.449 --> 15:50.576
Boy, I thought I'd heard everything.

15:50.784 --> 15:54.913
Yes. To Mr. Oceanbring's on Pickford Street.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.498
Mr. Oceanbring's?

15:56.707 --> 15:58.459
The world-famous men's hairstylist?

15:58.667 --> 16:00.294
It's the latest rage, Master Dick.

16:00.461 --> 16:06.633
Almost every rock 'n' roll star goes
to have his hair coiffed by Mr. Oceanbring.

16:06.842 --> 16:10.053
Are there hair dryers at Mr. Oceanbring's?

16:15.267 --> 16:16.768
Thanks.

16:17.186 --> 16:19.980
Well, what in the world
could he have meant by that?

16:20.189 --> 16:21.356
Well, madam, urn...

16:21.565 --> 16:24.985
...apparently something about the hair dryers
at Mr. Oceanbring's...

16:25.194 --> 16:27.696
...seemed particularly attractive to-- Uh--

16:27.905 --> 16:29.114
Yes.

16:34.786 --> 16:40.959
One day without the power to speak
and the whole world will be at our knees. Ha.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.671
Then they'll pay anything
to get their voices back. Ha.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.924
Being an honorable crook...

16:47.132 --> 16:50.802
...I'd let them off the hook
for a measly $22,400,000.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.305
- We should have finished off Batman.
- And Robin.

16:53.514 --> 16:55.057
When we had the chance.

16:55.224 --> 16:57.809
Oh, I couldn't bring myself to do it, boys.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.979
Even though I don't care very much
for that Boy Wonder...

17:01.188 --> 17:04.733
...Batman did save my life once.
I owe him that.

17:05.108 --> 17:08.819
If we do steal everyone's voices, how do we
give them back after we get paid off?

17:09.154 --> 17:10.571
Ah.

17:10.739 --> 17:13.032
With this devilishly clever little formula.

17:13.242 --> 17:17.996
Easily compounded of sweet basil, garlic,
salt and goat's milk in the right proportion.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.210
Twelve noon.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.546
Time to make the call.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.048
Quentin 3-3700.

17:28.257 --> 17:29.883
Sorry, wrong number, Catwoman.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.303
Batman.

17:33.512 --> 17:36.598
Batman, whyfor art thou doing this to me?

17:36.807 --> 17:38.559
It's my job, Catwoman.

17:38.767 --> 17:41.103
I am sworn to uphold the law.

17:41.311 --> 17:44.481
But if you'd just come down
off your high horse for a moment...

17:44.690 --> 17:47.818
...we could make such beautiful music
together.

17:48.026 --> 17:51.863
You'll play a different tune when we're through,
and all the notes will be sour.

17:52.072 --> 17:55.158
Party pooper.
Teenagers should be seen and not heard.

17:55.367 --> 17:58.161
All right, men, destroy the Dynamic Duo.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.581
Watch the antiques.

18:02.374 --> 18:04.418
Gentle with Batman, boys.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.252
Stay until Chief O'Hara arrives
and guard them.

18:47.461 --> 18:51.131
Someone let Catwoman out of the bag.
I can't let her get away now.

19:29.252 --> 19:33.632
The sonic beam in this gun can slice
like a hot knife through the high-priced spread.

19:33.799 --> 19:35.634
Ah, but I've reached an impasse.

19:36.051 --> 19:40.472
Shall I steal your voice or end your life?

19:40.681 --> 19:43.433
Whichever you decide,
I'm sure it'll be the wrong choice.

19:43.642 --> 19:48.021
You have a pretty sharp tongue for a man
about to say goodbye to this world, Batman.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.649
Beg. Beg for your mortal existence.

19:51.024 --> 19:55.737
I'd rather die than beg
for such a small favor as my life.

19:55.946 --> 19:58.240
What are you waiting for?

20:00.117 --> 20:03.453
Can't you see how I feel about you, Batman?

20:04.538 --> 20:07.499
How I want you by my side.

20:07.708 --> 20:08.959
It won't work, Catwoman.

20:09.292 --> 20:12.170
If you're going to kill me,
you might as well get it over with.

20:20.971 --> 20:22.973
I can't kill the only man that I've...

20:23.765 --> 20:25.684
Don't worry, Catwoman.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.562
You wouldn't have killed me
even though you shot the gun.

20:28.729 --> 20:33.608
The Anti Bat-sonic device in my Utility Belt
would have deflected the beam.

20:33.984 --> 20:37.195
Ha-ha.
Well, it was a good plot while it lasted.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.656
Yes, Catwoman, one of your very best.

20:39.865 --> 20:41.491
Thank you.

20:41.700 --> 20:46.329
But still the problem remains.
How do we undo what you did?

20:46.788 --> 20:48.498
- The stolen voices?
-Yes.

20:48.707 --> 20:53.086
Oh, well, you just, uh, have them all spray
their throats with the atomizer.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.630
- Get them back to normal in seconds. Heh.
-Amazing.

20:55.797 --> 21:02.095
Hm. Uh, you see, my voice-eraser
electronically loosened their vocal chords...

21:02.304 --> 21:07.851
...and, uh, just have them spray it
and it'll, uh, tighten them right back up again.

21:08.059 --> 21:09.394
- Amazing.
-Mm.

21:09.603 --> 21:14.357
Batman, when I get out of jail,
will you take me on a date?

21:15.484 --> 21:19.237
Well, I have plenty of time to think about that,
Catwoman.

21:19.654 --> 21:21.114
Several years, I'm afraid.

21:21.490 --> 21:25.744
If I were to kiss you,
would you think I was a bad girl?

21:26.578 --> 21:28.914
But, uh-- No.

21:29.122 --> 21:31.500
No, of course not, Catwoman.

21:31.708 --> 21:35.670
Kissing is one of the most natural things
in the world.

21:38.882 --> 21:44.513
Uh, some people kiss almost every day,
I'm told.

21:45.597 --> 21:47.390
Well...

21:49.017 --> 21:50.936
Come on, Batman. The police are here.

21:53.855 --> 21:55.023
Boy Blunder.

21:55.232 --> 21:59.820
Catwoman,
may I take a rain check on that kiss?

22:00.529 --> 22:02.656
Certainly, Batman.

22:03.198 --> 22:05.033
Anytime.

22:14.376 --> 22:16.586
Holy mush.

22:26.221 --> 22:28.515
<i>Went up to my boss today</i>

22:28.682 --> 22:30.809
<i>I said, "Hey, man, can I have more pay?"</i>

22:30.976 --> 22:33.812
I said, "Will, you, please, sir?"

22:33.979 --> 22:36.314
<i>He took one look at me and then</i>

22:36.481 --> 22:39.693
<i>He said, "If you ask me that again
I'll kill you"</i>

22:39.901 --> 22:41.820
Aren't they great, Alfred?

22:42.028 --> 22:45.615
Well, they certainly do sway, don't they?

22:45.824 --> 22:49.953
- Very hep, Alfred.
-it's "hip," Aunt Harriet. They changed it.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.580
<i>It's just to do and die, I know</i>

22:51.746 --> 22:55.542
<i>But even so
It seems that the world</i>

22:55.959 --> 22:58.503
<i>Has passed me over</i>

23:02.090 --> 23:04.259
<i>Same sort of thing
With the birds in this town</i>

23:04.426 --> 23:07.220
<i>I pick 'em up
They put me down</i>

23:07.387 --> 23:09.806
<i>Still you can't complain much</i>

23:09.973 --> 23:12.183
<i>If I had a fancy car</i>

23:12.350 --> 23:14.269
<i>Mercedes or a Jaguar</i>

23:14.436 --> 23:15.896
<i>I'd thrill her</i>

23:16.062 --> 23:17.564
Well, Bruce Wayne.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.774
Commissioner,
nice to hear your voice again.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.110
<i>Do I have to cry?</i>

23:22.319 --> 23:25.071
<i>Ours not to reason why, I know</i>

23:25.238 --> 23:27.574
<i>It's just to do and die, I know</i>

23:27.741 --> 23:31.703
<i>But even so
It seems that the world</i>

23:31.870 --> 23:34.456
<i>Has passed me over</i>

23:41.004 --> 23:45.383
My, uh, grandchildren insisted that I come
and hear their Chad and Jeremy.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.427
A bit on the groovy side, aren't they?

23:47.761 --> 23:49.888
Every era has its own music,
commissioner...

23:50.096 --> 23:53.099
...its own art, its own manner of speech.

23:53.308 --> 23:56.603
Of course,
the essence of progress is change.

23:56.811 --> 23:59.105
A point well taken, Mrs. Cooper.

23:59.272 --> 24:04.277
But there's one pair in the public eye which
I pray will never suffer the stigma of antiquity.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.613
Batman and Robin, commissioner?

24:06.821 --> 24:10.033
You took the words right out of my mouth,
Mrs. Cooper.

24:11.201 --> 24:13.620
<i>It's just to do and die, I know</i>

24:13.787 --> 24:17.791
<i>But even so
It seems that the world</i>

24:17.958 --> 24:20.460
<i>Has passed me over</i>

24:21.305 --> 24:27.907
