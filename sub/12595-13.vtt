20:42.808 --> 20:43.208
<b>Hold it up.</b>

20:43.208 --> 20:43.943
<b>&gt;&gt; Guys, I have to know, what</b>

20:43.944 --> 20:46.511
<b>was it like having a new veteran</b>

20:46.512 --> 20:47.212
<b>entering the competition each</b>

20:47.212 --> 20:47.580
<b>week?</b>

20:47.581 --> 20:53.117
<b>Alex, did it change the game?</b>

20:53.118 --> 20:54.953
<b>&gt;&gt; Yeah, it definitely changed</b>

20:54.954 --> 20:55.654
<b>the game.</b>

20:55.655 --> 20:57.322
<b>It definitely divided the house</b>

20:57.323 --> 20:58.957
<b>with veterans and the new</b>

20:58.958 --> 20:59.792
<b>artists coming in.</b>

20:59.793 --> 21:02.227
<b>I felt like a new artist</b>

21:02.228 --> 21:03.062
<b>naturally banded together right</b>

21:03.062 --> 21:03.596
<b>from the start.</b>

21:03.597 --> 21:05.230
<b>&gt;&gt; James, you were the last</b>

21:05.231 --> 21:06.297
<b>veteran to enter the game.</b>

21:06.298 --> 21:08.166
<b>Did that put a target on your</b>

21:08.167 --> 21:08.467
<b>back?</b>

21:08.467 --> 21:09.101
<b>&gt;&gt; Lord have mercy.</b>

21:09.102 --> 21:14.505
<b>I'm going to say it did.</b>

21:14.506 --> 21:14.907
<b>[ Laughter ]</b>

21:14.908 --> 21:16.441
<b>&gt;&gt; Coming into the competition</b>

21:16.442 --> 21:17.942
<b>was like a snake pit and I felt</b>

21:17.943 --> 21:24.682
<b>like the new artists were coming</b>

21:24.683 --> 21:27.785
<b>at me from every angle.</b>

21:27.786 --> 21:28.621
<b>&gt;&gt; Oli?</b>

21:28.622 --> 21:30.455
<b>&gt;&gt; It's becoming more about</b>

21:30.456 --> 21:35.360
<b>strategy and in this season</b>

21:35.361 --> 21:38.096
<b>especially people teaming up</b>

21:38.097 --> 21:38.530
<b>together.</b>

21:38.530 --> 21:39.331
<b>&gt;&gt; Creating alliances.</b>

21:39.331 --> 21:39.698
<b>&gt;&gt; Yes.</b>

21:39.698 --> 21:40.366
<b>&gt;&gt; Sarah?</b>

21:40.367 --> 21:41.933
<b>&gt;&gt; That was one way to play the</b>

21:41.934 --> 21:43.534
<b>game but alliances and throwing</b>

21:43.535 --> 21:45.336
<b>people under the bus, I think it</b>

21:45.337 --> 21:47.538
<b>kind of creates unnecessary</b>

21:47.539 --> 21:49.340
<b>drama and tension and affects</b>

21:49.341 --> 21:50.575
<b>the artwork.</b>

21:50.576 --> 21:54.746
<b>On my season, it wasn't a</b>

21:54.747 --> 21:55.314
<b>malicious shark tank.</b>

21:55.314 --> 21:56.048
<b>&gt;&gt; Well, Christian, you created</b>

21:56.048 --> 21:56.749
<b>the alliance that some would</b>

21:56.750 --> 21:59.417
<b>argue ran the game.</b>

21:59.418 --> 22:01.452
<b>&gt;&gt; What do you think about that?</b>

22:01.453 --> 22:03.421
<b>&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think to win this</b>

22:03.422 --> 22:04.656
<b>competition you had to have a</b>

22:04.657 --> 22:07.225
<b>good strategy to keep your</b>

22:07.226 --> 22:07.693
<b>opponents down.</b>

22:07.694 --> 22:10.528
<b>That makes you a smart player.</b>

22:10.529 --> 22:11.130
<b>We came in with a huge</b>

22:11.131 --> 22:12.564
<b>disadvantage against the vets</b>

22:12.565 --> 22:14.766
<b>and trying to survive.</b>

22:14.767 --> 22:16.868
<b>It was logical to band together</b>

22:16.869 --> 22:19.170
<b>and hit the vest as hard as we</b>

22:19.171 --> 22:23.174
<b>could and look who is sitting</b>

22:23.175 --> 22:23.576
<b>here.</b>

22:23.576 --> 22:23.943
<b>[ Cheers ]</b>

22:23.943 --> 22:24.777
<b>&gt;&gt; That's interesting.</b>

22:24.778 --> 22:28.346
<b>Let's talk to matti because</b>

22:28.347 --> 22:31.082
<b>matti, you kind of praised both</b>

22:31.083 --> 22:31.450
<b>sides.</b>

22:31.451 --> 22:32.750
<b>&gt;&gt; You come into a house and</b>

22:32.751 --> 22:34.319
<b>everybody is going after you.</b>

22:34.320 --> 22:36.688
<b>You would be stupid if you</b>

22:36.689 --> 22:37.022
<b>didn't.</b>

22:37.022 --> 22:37.456
<b>&gt;&gt; Yeah.</b>

22:37.457 --> 22:40.491
<b>&gt;&gt; Wow.</b>

22:40.492 --> 22:45.029
<b>There can only be one "ink</b>"

22:45.030 --> 22:45.764
"<b>master" so if you have to form</b>

22:45.765 --> 22:48.299
<b>some crazy alliance and army to</b>

22:48.300 --> 22:49.934
<b>knock everybody out, come on.</b>

22:49.935 --> 22:54.105
<b>&gt;&gt; Yeah, here we go with the</b>

22:54.106 --> 22:56.407
<b>lone wolf thing again, man.</b>

22:56.408 --> 22:58.309
<b>What about your girlfriend?</b>

22:58.310 --> 22:59.544
<b>How is that any different?</b>

22:59.545 --> 23:00.412
<b>It's the same thing.</b>

23:00.413 --> 23:01.479
<b>&gt;&gt; Girlfriend, huh?</b>

23:01.480 --> 23:02.580
<b>&gt;&gt; Absolutely.</b>

23:02.581 --> 23:03.581
<b>The same thing.</b>

23:03.582 --> 23:06.784
<b>I'll tell you the biggest</b>

23:06.785 --> 23:08.720
<b>mistake Megan made was leaving</b>

23:08.721 --> 23:10.321
<b>the alliance and hooking up...</b>

23:10.322 --> 23:12.223
<b>&gt;&gt; How do you respond to that?</b>

23:12.224 --> 23:14.459
<b>&gt;&gt; Look, I respect the</b>

23:14.460 --> 23:15.127
<b>allegiance.</b>

23:15.128 --> 23:16.661
<b>Clearly that strategy worked for</b>

23:16.662 --> 23:16.962
<b>them.</b>

23:16.963 --> 23:18.429
<b>I think that I just thought it</b>

23:18.430 --> 23:21.032
<b>was ridiculous that Anthony and</b>

23:21.033 --> 23:22.001
<b>Christian thought they could</b>

23:22.002 --> 23:25.470
<b>tell me who I could hang out</b>

23:25.471 --> 23:25.771
<b>with.</b>

23:25.771 --> 23:26.171
<b>&gt;&gt; Okay.</b>

23:26.172 --> 23:28.640
<b>&gt;&gt; So ultimately, ultimately,</b>

23:28.641 --> 23:30.341
<b>they didn't like that I wouldn't</b>

23:30.342 --> 23:33.978
<b>go after cleen and eventually my</b>

<b>relationship with cleen was more</b>

23:36.181 --> 23:38.182
<b>important to me than the</b>

<b>alliance.</b>

23:38.584 --> 23:39.551
<b>&gt;&gt; Let's get into that.</b>

23:39.552 --> 23:43.922
<b>We're all dying to know.</b>

23:43.923 --> 23:46.891
<b>Hold up, guys, you want to hear</b>

<b>this.</b>

<b>We're dying to know the status</b>

<b>between you and cleen here?</b>

<b>&gt;&gt; Yeah, we've avoided that.</b>

<b>Okay.</b>

24:03.643 --> 24:06.811
<b>I'm a pretty up front person.</b>

<b>Cleen and I have, like I would</b>

24:10.549 --> 24:10.950
<b>&gt;&gt; Okay.</b>

24:10.951 --> 24:13.418
<b>&gt;&gt; And we're figuring it out.</b>

24:13.419 --> 24:15.887
<b>Cleen is a cowboy and he's easy</b>

<b>to love, but hard to hold.</b>

<b>&gt;&gt; I got you.</b>

<b>came after me.</b>

24:45.784 --> 24:47.185
<b>Clearly, the guy they should</b>

<b>guy here.</b>

<b>If they thought for a second he</b>

<b>&gt;&gt; Wow.</b>

<b>&gt;&gt; I think as soon as he saw</b>

<b>Christian and Anthony were there</b>

<b>to do a job, you know.</b>

<b>together.</b>

<b>&gt;&gt; We aren't headed to Maui.</b>

<b>&gt;&gt; Is there a benefit to playing</b>

<b>the strategy side of the game?</b>

<b>work smart and not hard, and it</b>

<b>goes with the same thing playing</b>

<b>the game.</b>

<b>Everybody lines up.</b>

<b>Really, one thing is true there</b>

<b>All the mouths in the world</b>

<b>these tattoos, look at the</b>

<b>&gt;&gt; Everybody under estimated me</b>

<b>I have to prove to everyone</b>

<b>&gt;&gt; I may have used strategy to</b>

<b>&gt;&gt; I came with a dragon, this is</b>

39:49.455 --> 39:51.756
<b>one of the things I struggle</b>

<b>with during the competition.</b>

<b>&gt;&gt; I'm pushing myself with my</b>

<b>black and gray with the color</b>

45:52.851 --> 45:53.251
<b>background.</b>

45:53.252 --> 45:54.552
<b>I think there is some areas</b>

45:54.553 --> 45:55.953
<b>where your color got away from</b>

45:55.954 --> 45:57.822
<b>you a little bit but the details</b>

45:57.823 --> 45:59.156
<b>and the smoothness, nobody can</b>

48:11.323 --> 48:13.557
<b>It stands strong and saturated.</b>

48:13.558 --> 48:15.159

48:15.160 --> 48:16.360
<b>falls pretty short.</b>

48:16.361 --> 48:17.561
<b>I think that the inside of the</b>

48:20.232 --> 48:21.966
<b>you know, tattooed well but just</b>

48:21.967 --> 48:23.901
<b>not laid out nice and I think</b>

<b>that you could have had a better</b>

<b>drawing got away from you on</b>

48:38.984 --> 48:40.117
<b>this one and I think that all</b>

48:40.118 --> 48:42.353
<b>the area you did on the inside</b>

48:42.354 --> 48:43.854
<b>of the arm really you should</b>

<b>have worked on the outside and</b>

<b>boosted everything up.</b>
