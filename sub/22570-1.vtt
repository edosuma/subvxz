WEBVTT

00:36.933 --> 00:40.100
(Indistinct conversation)

00:40.133 --> 00:43.167
MAN: ...solar panels that we pop
over the farmland, switch on...

00:43.200 --> 00:45.233
Figures and next year's
forecast, sir.

00:47.600 --> 00:51.400
- Did you not bring biscuits?
- There weren't any, sir.

00:51.433 --> 00:53.467
MAN: ..acquire up to
600 acres...

00:53.500 --> 00:55.100
No biscuits?

00:55.133 --> 00:57.167
MAN: ..starting with a site
in North Essex,

00:57.200 --> 01:00.433
which we received planning
permission for on 4th of May.

01:00.467 --> 01:03.500
A 51-acre site, 30 megawatts
of power per annum,

01:03.533 --> 01:07.600
and a saving of 180,000 tonnes
of carbon dioxide

01:07.633 --> 01:10.233
over the course
of a 30-year lease.

01:10.267 --> 01:12.667
For centuries, man has looked
for the Earth's bounty

01:12.700 --> 01:14.133
below the ground.

01:14.167 --> 01:17.700
But now we are on the brink
of a new age of clean,

01:17.733 --> 01:20.533
carbon-neutral energy production
from the sun,

01:20.567 --> 01:22.733
and the treasure,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:22.767 --> 01:26.800
is very much above our heads.

01:26.833 --> 01:29.033
Church Farm -
once these solar panels

01:29.067 --> 01:30.767
start being erected
in six weeks' time -

01:30.800 --> 01:33.367
will be the third-largest
solar farm in England.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.333
And will supply
low-cost electricity

01:35.367 --> 01:38.267
to the local town of Danebury.

01:40.133 --> 01:42.067
(Birds chirruping)

01:57.167 --> 02:00.100
Look at that.
Not a cloud in the sky.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.733
(Andy exhales)

02:02.767 --> 02:04.767
- Shall we?
- Let's.

02:14.500 --> 02:19.500
* Will you search
the lonely earth for me?

02:19.533 --> 02:23.067
* Climb through the briar
and bramble?

02:24.267 --> 02:28.433
* I'll be your treasure

02:34.367 --> 02:37.067
* I've felt the touch
of the kings

02:37.100 --> 02:39.100
* And the breath of the wind

02:39.133 --> 02:41.733
* I knew the call
of all the songbirds

02:41.767 --> 02:47.467
* They sang all the wrong words

02:47.500 --> 02:50.533
* I'm waiting for you

02:51.733 --> 02:55.533
* I'm waiting for you

03:06.100 --> 03:08.033
What do you think that is?

03:09.600 --> 03:11.233
Oh, yeah.

03:11.267 --> 03:12.600
That's a retaining plate

03:12.633 --> 03:15.800
from the back of
a mid-20th-century socket mount.

03:15.833 --> 03:18.267
Would have had
a rod coming off here,

03:18.300 --> 03:20.600
with a loop to attach it
to the spring housing.

03:22.467 --> 03:25.267
Brilliant. I can cross that
off my wish list.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.533
Don't knock it, mate.

03:26.567 --> 03:28.467
That's a piece of history
right there.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.833
Small scrap
of a life long forgotten.

03:30.867 --> 03:34.133
Easy for you to say, you've got
a piece in the British Museum.

03:34.167 --> 03:37.467
- Have I told you about that?
- Where do you go from there?

03:37.500 --> 03:39.033
What do you aspire to?

03:39.067 --> 03:41.667
Is there a Nobel Prize
for metal detecting?

03:41.700 --> 03:43.633
There should be.

03:46.367 --> 03:48.167
We're so lucky living here.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.433
When you think about
how small this island is.

03:51.467 --> 03:53.400
We're walking on archaeology.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.100
There's nowhere we could tread

03:55.133 --> 03:57.333
that hasn't been trod on
a thousand times before

03:57.367 --> 04:01.167
by...Celts, the Druids,
the Romans.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.667
- What have you got?
- Scaffold clamp.

04:05.100 --> 04:07.300
Saxons, the Vikings.

04:07.333 --> 04:10.367
You know, when I look at
this landscape, I can read it.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.133
That's the likely site
of a settlement.

04:14.167 --> 04:16.166
Where the workers gather
for their lunch.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.067
That's where someone
left some scaffolding.

04:32.567 --> 04:35.433
If you could invite any
six people to a dinner party,

04:35.467 --> 04:36.633
who would it be?

04:36.667 --> 04:39.767
Anyone from history.
Alive or dead.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.467
- Alive, probably.
- You know what I mean.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.767
- I know who I wouldn't invite.
- Who?

04:44.800 --> 04:46.533
Stephen Fry or Jesus.

04:46.567 --> 04:47.767
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.633
They get invited to imaginary
dinner parties all the time.

04:50.667 --> 04:52.633
I doubt they'd be
very good company.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.733
Probably a bit bored and bolshy.

04:54.767 --> 04:57.567
And the Dalai Lama.
A bit moody.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.467
I don't know, maybe Kurt Cobain?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.433
Oh, yeah, he'd be a good laugh.

05:01.467 --> 05:05.200
He was known for his sparkling
dinner party conversation.

05:05.233 --> 05:07.167
Will there be heroin
at this dinner party?

05:08.233 --> 05:10.700
Oh, speaking of which...

05:10.733 --> 05:13.633
I reckon one of Kate's friends
is smoking in my flat.

05:13.667 --> 05:16.233
You know, bit of the old, uh...
(Whistles)

05:16.267 --> 05:18.300
- Go on, say it.
- What?

05:18.333 --> 05:19.500
Wacky backy.

05:19.533 --> 05:21.367
I wasn't gonna say
"wacky backy".

05:21.400 --> 05:24.300
- What were you gonna say?
- Spliff.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.567
Cool.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.667
Is Kate still in the spare room?

05:28.700 --> 05:30.100
Yeah. Yeah.

05:31.267 --> 05:33.567
- Yeah.
- You don't mind?

05:33.600 --> 05:36.533
No, no. It's great, you know.

05:36.567 --> 05:38.500
Brings a bit of life
to the place.

05:38.533 --> 05:41.600
It's no longer
Lance's sad bachelor pad,

05:41.633 --> 05:44.800
all spick and span and tidy.

05:44.833 --> 05:48.633
Now there's people about.
Young people.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.700
Stuff all over the floor.

05:52.733 --> 05:56.833
No, it's great.
I don't even mind the...

05:56.867 --> 05:58.700
- Wacky backy.
- ..spliff.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.800
Oh, that's good, that's great.

06:00.833 --> 06:05.267
- You ever stay at Toni's?
- No, I can't, I get seasick.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.733
Mate, she lives on a barge,
a narrowboat.

06:07.767 --> 06:10.033
It's not being tossed
upon the open seas.

06:10.067 --> 06:12.367
Well, it makes no difference.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.300
I can feel movement, even when
it's imperceptible to others.

06:16.333 --> 06:19.033
I last about ten minutes,

06:19.067 --> 06:22.367
then I start to sweat and heave.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.833
That's not a good look.

06:25.867 --> 06:27.733
How's it going
at the mother-in-law's?

06:27.767 --> 06:31.533
Oh, it's great, it's great.
It's all good.

06:32.867 --> 06:35.233
She's a bit...sometimes,

06:35.267 --> 06:37.633
but she likes me better
now that I've got a job.

06:37.667 --> 06:40.733
She adores Stanley, baby-sits,
so, no, it's all good.

06:40.767 --> 06:43.667
You don't miss
not having your own space?

06:43.700 --> 06:47.167
I've er...I've taken up vaping
of an evening.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.533
Just so that I can go and stand
alone in the garden

06:49.567 --> 06:51.600
- for ten minutes.
- Oh, there you go.

06:52.833 --> 06:54.267
Ideal.

06:54.733 --> 06:56.333
Yeah.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.667
Yeah.

07:24.233 --> 07:26.133
- Hello.
- In here.

07:32.533 --> 07:35.667
Make sure you put your things
back in the cupboard,

07:35.700 --> 07:37.700
so I don't fall over them again.

07:37.733 --> 07:39.633
Yeah. Doing that now.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.200
VERONICA: Put your boots
on the paper.

07:42.233 --> 07:43.367
I just done it, just now.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.500
Don't get snippy with me.
I heard that.

07:48.533 --> 07:51.033
I hate being told to do stuff
that I've already done,

07:51.067 --> 07:54.333
or I'm actually in the process
of doing.

07:54.367 --> 07:56.400
I bet you don't speak
to Rebecca like that.

07:56.433 --> 07:58.833
I wouldn't dare.

07:58.867 --> 08:01.300
- Is she here?
- Giving Stanley a bath.

08:01.333 --> 08:04.200
Don't go in the lounge,
it's all set up for my ladies.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.367
OK.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.533
Where have you been today?

08:07.567 --> 08:09.433
- Metal detecting?
- Yeah.

08:09.467 --> 08:10.767
Find anything?

08:10.800 --> 08:13.033
BOTH: Nah.

08:13.067 --> 08:15.433
Look who's clean
and ready for bed.

08:15.467 --> 08:19.300
Hello, sunshine.
Who's reading you a story?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.767
- You.
- Yeah.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.433
Oh, before you put Stanley
to bed,

08:22.467 --> 08:24.333
can you check on
that bathroom mirror?

08:24.367 --> 08:26.667
It's loose, I'm afraid
it's gonna fall off the wall.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.433
OK. Better go and find my drill.

08:28.467 --> 08:31.233
- I might be some time.
- Do you want a glass of wine?

08:31.267 --> 08:33.133
- Oh, yes, please.
- I'll bring one out.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.267
What story shall we read, hm?

08:58.233 --> 08:59.267
(Sighs)

09:15.733 --> 09:17.667
(She chuckles)

09:19.300 --> 09:20.800
Are you missing your shed?

09:27.133 --> 09:30.300
Who was it who said any man
who, past the age of 30,

09:30.333 --> 09:33.733
finds himself without a shed,
can consider himself a failure?

09:33.767 --> 09:37.200
- Titchmarsh?
- Might have been Titchmarsh.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.800
We're not gonna be here forever.

09:40.833 --> 09:42.800
Just until we get
a deposit together.

09:42.833 --> 09:46.667
And now you're working, that's
gonna happen all the sooner.

09:46.700 --> 09:48.667
Don't you start
a new dig at work tomorrow?

09:48.700 --> 09:50.767
Yeah. New site near Colchester.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.500
They're putting up
an office block

09:52.533 --> 09:55.133
and we've got to go check out
what could be Roman walls.

09:55.167 --> 09:58.033
- That could be exciting.
- Oh, yeah, definitely, yeah.

09:58.067 --> 10:00.300
- Yeah?
- Oh, absolutely.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.267
A lot of archaeologists think
there's a lost Roman settlement

10:03.300 --> 10:06.267
- outside Colchester.
- There you go, then.

10:06.300 --> 10:09.267
Here's to you finding
the Essex Herculaneum.

10:14.467 --> 10:17.000
- Terry's got two sheds.
- You can have one shed.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.667
- Morning.
- Well, almost.

11:16.700 --> 11:19.200
- What time is it?
- 12:45.

11:19.233 --> 11:20.700
Oh, shit.

11:23.133 --> 11:24.467
You have a good night?

11:24.500 --> 11:26.100
KATE: Yeah, it was all right.

11:28.767 --> 11:30.133
Where'd you go?

11:30.167 --> 11:31.367
KATE: We had a lock-in,

11:31.400 --> 11:34.633
just stayed in the bar
after it closed up.

11:34.667 --> 11:38.200
- You working tonight?
KATE: I've got the night off.

11:38.233 --> 11:41.033
I've invited people round here,
actually.

11:41.067 --> 11:42.567
KATE: That's all right,
isn't it?

11:42.600 --> 11:44.367
Yeah.

11:45.467 --> 11:47.067
You want some cheese on toast?

11:47.100 --> 11:48.300
KATE: Oh, yes, please.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.533
Actually, love...

11:59.867 --> 12:01.833
..Mrs Morris was asking

12:01.867 --> 12:03.733
whether you could
keep the noise down

12:03.767 --> 12:07.300
when you ask friends back here
late at night, cos...

12:07.333 --> 12:10.267
Honestly, Dad, I couldn't make
any less noise if I tried.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.167
This place is so
deathly quiet at night,

12:12.200 --> 12:14.567
the tiniest noise, like,
echoes around the town.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.633
- I know, but she's old.
- I dropped my keys.

12:16.667 --> 12:19.133
That's what it was. I dropped
my keys, and I swear to God,

12:19.167 --> 12:22.433
I saw five lights come on.
People coming to their windows.

12:22.467 --> 12:24.533
Well, that...

12:24.567 --> 12:26.133
That's Danebury for you.

12:31.367 --> 12:34.633
Oh, and, Kate,
you know the cheese?

12:34.667 --> 12:37.067
KATE: What?
- You know the cheese,

12:37.100 --> 12:39.567
if you cut a corner off it,
it makes it harder to sli...

12:39.600 --> 12:41.600
- It doesn't matter.
- Sorry, what?

12:41.633 --> 12:43.767
Doesn't matter,
it's just the cheese...

13:06.767 --> 13:09.067
Stick your hat on, mate,
you'll get me fined.

13:12.433 --> 13:15.200
No, I know.
But rules are rules.

13:17.233 --> 13:19.300
- You find anything, no?
- I don't know, mate.

13:19.333 --> 13:20.300
This is promising stuff.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.567
This definitely looks like
a Roman building,

13:22.600 --> 13:24.467
there's bits of this around.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.600
This is obviously
the exterior of the wall,

13:26.633 --> 13:29.300
so the rest of the building
would have been in this area.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.667
I was gonna suggest
a trench parallel with the wall

13:31.700 --> 13:33.467
and then maybe one
in this direction.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.167
Yeah, I was thinking
more over there.

13:36.200 --> 13:40.567
- Over there?
- Yeah, around there, that area.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.200
- Why there?
- See what's there.

13:43.233 --> 13:44.300
Under there.

13:45.633 --> 13:47.567
You mean,
as opposed to over here?

13:47.600 --> 13:50.033
Yeah. Yeah, yes.

13:51.733 --> 13:53.667
I thought we were
more likely to find...

13:53.700 --> 13:57.233
That's not far from here, is it?
It's just there.

13:57.267 --> 14:00.500
- Yeah, I suppose.
- Yeah, I suppose.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.067
Well, we'll mark it out.

14:04.100 --> 14:07.400
And I don't think
we need to dig too deep.

14:07.433 --> 14:10.033
All right if I have
a quick sweep of this area

14:10.067 --> 14:11.433
- with my metal detector?
- Huh?

14:14.400 --> 14:15.800
You've got a metal detector?

14:15.833 --> 14:18.100
- Yeah, yeah.
- What for?

14:18.133 --> 14:19.367
It's a useful tool.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.367
You shouldn't be using a metal
detector without permission.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.600
But I'm asking permission.

14:23.633 --> 14:26.167
I know. I'm saying I don't think
the construction company

14:26.200 --> 14:28.233
will like you using
a metal detector.

14:28.833 --> 14:30.767
Could you ask?

14:34.067 --> 14:35.567
Yes.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.167
But don't hold your breath.

14:37.200 --> 14:40.033
And keep your hat on, mate.

14:41.733 --> 14:43.100
Health and safety.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.200
TERRY: I can tell by the very
healthy state of the finds table

14:54.233 --> 14:57.500
that last week's wet weather has
really helped your detecting.

14:57.533 --> 14:59.367
The ground
at the beginning of the month

14:59.400 --> 15:01.633
was so parched and cracked...

15:01.667 --> 15:05.200
..but a couple
of good days of rain

15:05.233 --> 15:07.833
- and those cracks become moist.
- (Sniggering)

15:07.867 --> 15:10.200
Which, of course,
makes it easier

15:10.233 --> 15:12.700
- for you to get your tool in.
- (Sniggering)

15:12.733 --> 15:17.033
And what else do moister
conditions mean, Hugh?

15:17.067 --> 15:18.633
Deeper penetration.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.467
Deeper penetration,
that's right.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.300
As much as six inches
in some cases.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.600
(Laughter)

15:27.633 --> 15:30.000
- Sorry, what's funny?
- Nothing.

15:31.133 --> 15:34.833
- Louise?
- Nothing. Nothing.

15:34.867 --> 15:38.267
Sorry, sorry, Terry,
I wasn't really concentrating.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.367
What do... What do
moist conditions mean?

15:40.400 --> 15:45.133
- Deeper penetration.
- That's right.

15:45.167 --> 15:46.333
TERRY: Oh, I see.

15:46.367 --> 15:49.567
You're being smutty, aren't you?
Cover your ears, Sheila.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.600
You shouldn't have to listen
to this filth.

15:51.633 --> 15:52.800
Sorry, Sheila.

15:52.833 --> 15:54.400
I don't mind.

15:54.433 --> 15:56.367
Luckily,
young Hugh doesn't get it.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.033
- Get what?
- He's nearly 35!

15:59.067 --> 16:02.133
Yeah, well, look,
smutty innuendo aside,

16:02.167 --> 16:07.733
as I say, some very choice finds
on the finds table.

16:07.767 --> 16:11.100
- Whose are the crotal bells?
- Those are mine.

16:11.133 --> 16:13.467
- Lovely pair.
- Thank you.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.800
Two very nice Victorian coins
here. Whose are these?

16:16.833 --> 16:19.400
They're mine. My first hoard.

16:19.433 --> 16:23.333
Well, I'm not sure
we can call that a hoard, Hugh.

16:23.367 --> 16:26.300
Purse spill, maybe.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.700
- Were they in the same haul?
- Close.

16:28.733 --> 16:31.667
TERRY: How close?
- 50 yards.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.033
They were in a straight line.

16:34.067 --> 16:35.500
But there are only two of them.

16:35.533 --> 16:38.300
Any two points on Earth
are in a straight line.

16:38.333 --> 16:40.833
Oh, now, I believe we have got

16:40.867 --> 16:44.200
some jewellery
retrieval service news.

16:44.233 --> 16:45.833
- Russ?
- Indeed.

16:45.867 --> 16:49.333
You'll recall how Hugh here
found an interesting badge

16:49.367 --> 16:51.700
that turned out to be
an identification tag

16:51.733 --> 16:54.033
from Her Majesty's Prison
Chelmsford.

16:54.067 --> 16:55.667
Well, after some research,

16:55.700 --> 16:58.733
we were able to match
the prisoner number

16:58.767 --> 17:05.032
to a Mr Oliver Meeka,
who sadly passed away in 1993.

17:05.067 --> 17:11.666
But we also were able to trace
his widow, who is still alive,

17:11.700 --> 17:13.633
and she's living in Ipswich.

17:13.666 --> 17:17.433
And so we were able
to return the badge to her.

17:19.300 --> 17:22.467
- How did that work out?
- It was a complete surprise.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.800
She had absolutely no idea

17:24.833 --> 17:27.467
that her husband
had even been to prison.

17:27.500 --> 17:32.400
She thought he'd been working
away in Colombia for 18 months.

17:32.433 --> 17:36.600
- In the hotel industry.
- She was very emotional.

17:36.633 --> 17:38.333
Quite tearful.

17:38.367 --> 17:40.567
Do you know
why he went to prison?

17:40.600 --> 17:41.700
Yes.

17:43.133 --> 17:44.733
He'd erm...

17:49.633 --> 17:50.833
He'd...

17:50.867 --> 17:53.167
I'd rather not talk about it,
because it's not nice.

17:55.567 --> 17:57.733
Oh, you're joking!
Look at this.

17:57.767 --> 17:59.833
Look, another solar farm. Yeah.

17:59.867 --> 18:02.267
Won't be any land left
to detect on soon.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.800
Well, it's clean,
sustainable energy, Louise.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.633
You ought to move with the
times, embrace the change.

18:07.667 --> 18:10.333
- Don't they fry birds?
- Fry them?

18:10.367 --> 18:13.033
HUGH: Yeah, fry them
out of the sky.

18:13.067 --> 18:15.400
Was that done with solar beams?

18:15.433 --> 18:19.400
No, the solar panels
absorb the sunlight, Hugh.

18:19.433 --> 18:23.100
They don't reflect it back
in concentred death rays.

18:23.133 --> 18:26.267
Don't they confuse bees?

18:26.300 --> 18:29.033
A confused bee's better than
no bee at all, Sheila.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.233
They help the bees,

18:30.267 --> 18:32.800
cos they plant wild flowers
in between the solar panels.

18:32.833 --> 18:37.100
- Where's this one going then?
LOUISE: It's... Hang on a sec...

18:37.133 --> 18:38.633
(Clears throat)

18:38.667 --> 18:43.167
Du-du-du-du-der...
"third-largest solar farm..."

18:43.200 --> 18:45.733
Yada, yada, yada, yada, yada.

18:45.767 --> 18:48.267
"30 megawatts..."
No, no, where is it?

18:48.300 --> 18:50.600
Ah, here we are.

18:50.633 --> 18:54.800
"Due to start construction
in six weeks at..."

19:00.267 --> 19:02.333
TERRY: Look who I found.

19:02.367 --> 19:05.233
- Toni's here.
- Hi, love.

19:05.267 --> 19:06.567
Hello, you.

19:06.600 --> 19:11.033
Cider, Numbers, Numbers

19:11.067 --> 19:14.200
and a Aperol spritz
for my good lady wife.

19:14.233 --> 19:16.400
Hee-hee!

19:16.433 --> 19:18.467
TONI: Thanks, Terry.
- Thanks, Terry.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.000
- Cheers, Terry.
- Cheers.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.767
Hang on, has something happened?

19:25.800 --> 19:28.433
Just found out
we've lost the farm.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.700
Oh, no. You've been there
for years, haven't you?

19:30.733 --> 19:32.767
- Five.
- Well, exactly.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.800
I mean,
you've searched the place out,

19:34.833 --> 19:37.233
you said yourself,
you've gotta accept change.

19:37.267 --> 19:39.433
- Time to move on.
- No such thing as searched out.

19:39.467 --> 19:40.433
There's always more.

19:40.467 --> 19:43.633
Always thought there was
something good there.

19:43.667 --> 19:47.833
Well, I thought this was
the year we were gonna find it.

19:47.867 --> 19:50.267
How long are the solar panels
going to be there?

19:51.333 --> 19:53.600
Says the lease is 30 years.

19:53.633 --> 19:57.333
- And how old are you now?
- 48.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.400
You'll find a new permission.

20:03.433 --> 20:05.700
I don't know, love,
it's getting harder and harder.

20:06.767 --> 20:08.700
Oh. Oh, well.

20:10.267 --> 20:12.500
Let's all take off
our gloomy trousers

20:12.533 --> 20:15.367
- and talk about something else.
- Good idea, love.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.533
SHELIA: Yeah.
TERRY: Change of subject.

20:23.433 --> 20:28.667
Ooh, I heard your Kate dropped
her keys the other night.

20:28.700 --> 20:31.167
TERRY: Mm.
- How do you know what?

20:31.200 --> 20:34.300
Who told us
that Kate dropped her keys?

20:34.333 --> 20:36.500
Was it Miriam in the pet shop?

20:36.533 --> 20:39.400
Miriam heard from one of the
mums at Clown Land.

20:39.433 --> 20:41.633
SHELIA: Did she find them?
- I don't think she lost them.

20:41.667 --> 20:44.133
- She just dropped them?
LANCE: I think so.

20:44.167 --> 20:45.433
I'll have to tell Miriam.

20:45.467 --> 20:47.400
If you could.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.533
It might be a good thing.

20:58.567 --> 21:00.300
You can spend more time with me,

21:00.333 --> 21:02.800
- or start writing songs again.
- Mm.

21:02.833 --> 21:06.033
When are you gonna play me
something on your mandolin?

21:06.067 --> 21:09.833
- I'm not that great.
- That wasn't the question.

21:09.867 --> 21:13.300
- Ah...I don't know.
- Tonight?

21:14.767 --> 21:17.400
- Ah...
- Kate's there?

21:17.433 --> 21:19.267
She's got some friends staying.

21:19.300 --> 21:20.800
I don't mind.

21:20.833 --> 21:23.400
The place isn't really my own
at the moment.

21:23.433 --> 21:25.600
Well, can't you bring
your mandolin over to mine?

21:27.100 --> 21:29.467
I stopped off at the chemist
and got these.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.600
Seasickness pills.

21:32.633 --> 21:34.733
It's just,
they don't agree with me.

21:34.767 --> 21:37.100
Yes, we do.

21:37.133 --> 21:39.400
I've had them before,
they make me hallucinate.

21:39.433 --> 21:41.300
- That sounds fun.
- Then I get the runs.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.367
Oh.

21:43.400 --> 21:48.567
Look... Look, I'll talk to Kate
and I'll sort it out.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.200
- I'm sorry. I promise.
- OK.

21:51.233 --> 21:53.300
Well, then,
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.733
- All right. Sorry.
- It's all right.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.167
Sorry.

22:24.067 --> 22:26.000
LANCE: I'm living in a squat.

22:28.833 --> 22:31.367
Did you say something?

22:31.400 --> 22:35.400
I said, "I live in a squat."
Shit everywhere.

22:35.433 --> 22:39.233
Towels on the floor, piles of
clothes, dirty mugs and plates.

22:39.267 --> 22:43.400
- Spillages.
- What's brought all this on?

22:43.433 --> 22:45.633
Toni won't stay
while Kate's there.

22:45.667 --> 22:47.800
And I'm worried
she's gonna leave me

22:47.833 --> 22:49.767
if I don't sort it out soon.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.667
The place isn't mine any more.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.400
I want it all
spick and span again.

22:53.433 --> 22:55.167
You should say something to Kate

22:55.200 --> 22:56.800
if she's staying there
rent-free.

22:56.833 --> 22:59.767
Yeah, I know.
I'm worried if I say anything,

22:59.800 --> 23:02.067
she's gonna up and leave again.

23:02.100 --> 23:04.300
I'm walking on eggshells.

23:04.333 --> 23:05.500
Literally.

23:05.533 --> 23:08.533
There was eggshells all over
the kitchen floor last week.

23:08.567 --> 23:11.833
If it's any consolation,
I hate my job.

23:11.867 --> 23:14.467
- Thought you loved your job?
- It's bullshit.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.233
Don't know
what's going on there.

23:16.267 --> 23:18.433
The site manager doesn't know
what he's doing.

23:18.467 --> 23:19.700
He's dead behind the eyes.

23:19.733 --> 23:21.200
I thought you had to be
passionate

23:21.233 --> 23:22.333
to be an archaeologist.

23:22.367 --> 23:25.200
It's not something
you can fall into reluctantly.

23:25.233 --> 23:28.133
Don't know what I'd do
without this place to escape to.

23:28.167 --> 23:29.500
I haven't even got a shed.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.800
- Call it a day?
- Go on, then.

23:32.833 --> 23:35.300
Switching off detectors
in five...

23:35.333 --> 23:37.433
BOTH: ..four, three...

23:37.467 --> 23:39.467
- (Electronic squeaking)
- Hang on.

23:41.400 --> 23:42.500
What you got?

23:42.533 --> 23:44.633
Jumping around
between 50 and 80.

23:46.100 --> 23:47.300
Probably just a shotty.

23:51.467 --> 23:53.133
ANDY: Bloody hell.

23:53.167 --> 23:54.300
Look at that.

23:54.333 --> 23:58.433
- It's a whistle.
- That is lovely.

23:58.467 --> 24:02.100
- Good job, mate.
- What's that, military?

24:02.133 --> 24:04.533
Nah, it's a hawking whistle.

24:04.567 --> 24:08.167
A falconer would have used that,
call his bird back.

24:08.200 --> 24:11.467
- Does it work?
- It's full of dirt, hang on.

24:21.867 --> 24:23.167
Go on.

24:25.767 --> 24:29.433
(Shrill whistle)

24:29.467 --> 24:31.400
(Whistle echoes)

24:38.500 --> 24:41.433
- Pub?
- Go on, then.

24:52.533 --> 24:55.667
(Shrill whistle)

25:08.233 --> 25:09.567
(Shrill whistle)

25:09.600 --> 25:11.467
(Whistle echoes)

25:14.067 --> 25:16.767
* One's for sorrow

25:16.800 --> 25:20.667
* Two's for joy

25:22.200 --> 25:24.333
* Three's for a girl

25:24.367 --> 25:28.500
* And four's for a boy

25:29.800 --> 25:32.500
* Five's for silver

25:32.533 --> 25:37.200
* Six for gold

25:37.233 --> 25:43.767
* Seven's for a secret
never told

25:45.100 --> 25:47.467
* Devil, devil

25:47.500 --> 25:52.600
* I defy thee

25:52.633 --> 25:55.100
* Devil, devil

25:55.133 --> 26:00.067
* I defy thee

26:00.100 --> 26:02.400
* Devil, devil

26:02.433 --> 26:07.767
* I defy thee

26:10.233 --> 26:13.367
* Oh, the magpie
brings us tidings

26:13.400 --> 26:18.133
* Of news both fair and foul

26:18.167 --> 26:21.833
* She's more cunning
than the raven

26:21.867 --> 26:26.767
* More wise than any owl

26:26.800 --> 26:29.800
* For she brings us news
of the harvest

26:29.833 --> 26:32.667
* Of the barley,
wheat and corn

26:32.700 --> 26:36.400
* And she knows when
we'll go to our graves

26:36.433 --> 26:40.800
* And how we shall be born

26:42.500 --> 26:44.833
* One's for sorrow

26:44.867 --> 26:48.833
* Two's for joy

26:48.867 --> 26:50.767
* Three's for a girl

26:50.800 --> 26:56.033
* And four's for a boy

26:56.067 --> 26:58.400
* Five's for silver

26:58.433 --> 27:02.800
* Six for gold

27:02.833 --> 27:10.733
* Seven's for a secret
never told
