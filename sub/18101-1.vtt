WEBVTT

00:05.876 --> 00:08.943
Justice...

00:09.010 --> 00:10.376
what does that word mean ?

00:10.443 --> 00:13.710
Today, for example, it means
that when an individual

00:13.776 --> 00:15.977
is charged
with attempted murder,

00:16.043 --> 00:20.662
that charge must be proven
beyond any reasonable doubt.

00:20.662 --> 00:24.209
And in order to prove
attempted murder,

00:24.276 --> 00:27.576
only one thing matters : intent.

00:27.643 --> 00:28.910
Now, I'm not going
to lie to you.

00:28.977 --> 00:31.013
Gordie Brock screwed up
big time.

00:31.013 --> 00:34.777
He came home drunk,
he beat up his wife Deena

00:34.843 --> 00:36.447
and sent her to the hospital.

00:36.447 --> 00:41.309
But when Deena Brock was lying
on that floor unconscious,

00:41.376 --> 00:44.142
it was Gordie Brock who called
for an ambulance.

00:44.209 --> 00:48.576
It was Gordie Brock who stopped 
his wife from bleeding to death

00:48.643 --> 00:50.610
before help arrived.

00:50.676 --> 00:52.443
Does that make him a hero ?

00:52.509 --> 00:54.450
Obviously not,

00:54.476 --> 00:56.810
but it does clearly show
one thing :

00:56.877 --> 01:02.476
While he abused his wife,
he never meant to kill her.

01:02.543 --> 01:07.343
He... never... meant...
to kill her.

01:07.409 --> 01:11.077
You can hate Gordie Brock
if you want

01:11.142 --> 01:12.409
for beating his wife...

01:12.476 --> 01:13.910
I do...

01:13.977 --> 01:15.910
but when you go into that
jury room, 

01:15.977 --> 01:17.476
remember those six words

01:17.543 --> 01:20.409
because they go to the heart
of this case.

01:20.476 --> 01:22.610
See, you have a job,

01:22.676 --> 01:26.509
and your job
is to deliver justice.

01:26.576 --> 01:32.976
And thankfully, the prosecution
has made your job easy.

01:33.043 --> 01:34.876
Two words :

01:40.809 --> 01:42.909
Not guilty.

01:42.976 --> 01:44.410
Do they always
decide so fast ?

01:44.436 --> 01:46.310
Well, three hours
isn't my record for an acquittal,

01:46.376 --> 01:47.495
but it'll do.

01:47.545 --> 01:48.634
You really saved
my ass.

01:48.634 --> 01:50.347
You just remember
what we talked about.

01:50.347 --> 01:51.610
Got a meeting
tonight.

01:51.676 --> 01:52.810
Good, okay.

01:52.876 --> 01:54.510
You didn't just
save his life,

01:54.576 --> 01:56.610
you saved mine, too.

01:59.810 --> 02:01.576
WOMAN:
Shark strikes again.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.109
Oh, Madam
District Attorney.

02:03.176 --> 02:04.379
I should have tried
this one myself.

02:04.379 --> 02:05.727
You know, as much
as I love going

02:05.727 --> 02:07.193
head-to-head
with you, Jess,

02:07.193 --> 02:08.709
it wouldn't have
mattered this time.

02:08.709 --> 02:10.942
Attempted murder ?
Gordie Brock is headlines.

02:10.961 --> 02:12.376
You went for the
glory, you lost.

02:12.526 --> 02:13.625
I tried to put away
a wife beater.

02:13.692 --> 02:15.526
Gordie Brock
belongs in prison.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.159
Well, the jury
disagreed, didn't they ?

02:17.226 --> 02:18.593
But if it's
any consolation,

02:18.659 --> 02:20.693
you look really hot
in that suit.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.025
Dream on.
I will.

02:22.092 --> 02:24.059
MAN:
How you doing, Stark ?
Hey.

02:29.359 --> 02:34.860
* Oh, the shark, babe,
has such teeth, dear *

02:34.925 --> 02:39.259
* And he shows them 
pearly white *

02:39.326 --> 02:46.192
* Just a jackknife has old
MacHeath, dear *

02:46.259 --> 02:50.226
* And he keeps it, yeah,
out of sight... *

02:51.426 --> 02:54.226
Margaret, why be a buzz kill ?

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

03:18.373 --> 03:19.713
Suspect's in the kitchen.

03:28.753 --> 03:29.839
GORDIE:
It's my lawyer, boys.

03:30.339 --> 03:32.406
So why not save
everybody some time and money

03:32.473 --> 03:33.772
and let me go right now ?

03:48.039 --> 03:49.939
WOMAN:
It's a shame I canceled
the photo shoot.

03:50.006 --> 03:52.172
Margaret, why are you
still here ?

03:52.239 --> 03:54.839
I've been asking myself that
for nine long years.

03:54.905 --> 03:56.306
Well, then surely
you're familiar

03:56.373 --> 03:58.206
with the phrase
"cancel everything."

03:58.273 --> 03:59.673
Your clients are.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.072
You got to get back
on the horse.

04:01.139 --> 04:02.506
Now look, here's a tip, okay ?

04:02.573 --> 04:04.424
Why don't you take
the equestrian metaphors

04:04.424 --> 04:05.779
and shove 'em you know where ?

04:05.779 --> 04:06.839
Oh, that's nice.

04:06.905 --> 04:08.839
Why aren't you in school ?

04:08.905 --> 04:11.206
It's 4:30
in the afternoon, Dad.
Oh.

04:11.273 --> 04:13.430
Do you want
more green peppers in your eggs ?

04:13.450 --> 04:15.172
Not hungry.

04:15.239 --> 04:16.706
It's 'cause you're depressed.

04:16.772 --> 04:19.005
Hi.
Hi.

04:19.072 --> 04:20.736
Ooh, you smell.

04:20.736 --> 04:22.449
When was the last time
you took a shower ?

04:22.450 --> 04:24.039
Tuesday.

04:25.573 --> 04:27.239
Look, Dad, after
the whole Deena Brock thing,

04:27.306 --> 04:29.673
it makes perfect sense for you
to punish yourself out of guilt.

04:29.740 --> 04:31.789
The white teen Oprah speaks.

04:31.789 --> 04:33.763
Yes, well, the scars
of my broken home

04:33.763 --> 04:35.729
have made me wise
beyond my years.

04:35.729 --> 04:36.706
Come on, Dad,

04:36.772 --> 04:37.872
it's been a month.

04:37.939 --> 04:39.296
I'm really worried about you.

04:39.296 --> 04:41.586
These are good.

04:41.586 --> 04:42.912
I'm okay.
Yeah ?

04:42.912 --> 04:44.318
Really. Yes, I am.

04:43.972 --> 04:45.863
Shouldn't you
be getting home ?

04:45.863 --> 04:48.006
Oh, I just came by
to remind you about
the custody hearing.

04:48.072 --> 04:49.206
I don't do
custody, honey.

04:49.273 --> 04:51.172
Custody of <i>me,</i> Dad.

04:51.239 --> 04:52.506
I turned 16 last month ?

04:52.573 --> 04:53.673
Thanks for the card.

04:53.740 --> 04:55.206
Ouch. Sorry.

04:55.273 --> 04:57.872
Now I have to decide who gets
final custody, you or Mom.

04:57.939 --> 04:59.805
That judge was
a major putz.

04:59.872 --> 05:00.905
You got a phone call.

05:00.972 --> 05:02.673
I'm out.
It's the Mayor.

05:02.740 --> 05:04.206
Said something about
a ten-year audit

05:04.273 --> 05:05.905
on your city tax return.

05:06.172 --> 05:08.840
MAN:
 <i>Did you read Lopez</i>
 <i>this morning ?</i>

05:08.906 --> 05:10.872
No.
Aspen's still the playground
for the rich and famous

05:10.939 --> 05:13.328
but L.A.'s a new hot spot
to get away with murder.

05:13.328 --> 05:15.310
You should audit
his taxes.

05:15.310 --> 05:16.365
Truth is, I'm sick
of the poor going

05:16.365 --> 05:19.339
to jail for jaywalking
while millionaires 
kill each other

05:19.339 --> 05:20.905
without missing 
a massage.

05:20.972 --> 05:23.414
We're starting
a high profile crime unit

05:23.414 --> 05:24.255
in the DA's office

05:24.255 --> 05:26.206
to nail rich folk
with fancy lawyers like you.

05:27.504 --> 05:28.637
What's so funny ?

05:28.704 --> 05:30.337
I tell you what, Mr. Mayor.

05:30.404 --> 05:32.571
You put ten prosecutors
on a big-time case,

05:32.637 --> 05:34.671
you give 'em all
the money they can spend,

05:34.737 --> 05:36.871
and I'll bury 'em alive
every day of the week

05:36.938 --> 05:38.624
with a matinee on Wednesday
and another on Sunday.

05:38.624 --> 05:40.437
So you think
Devlin's incompetent ?

05:40.504 --> 05:42.204
Hey, she's got great legs,
but she doesn't know diddly

05:42.270 --> 05:43.671
about winning
big jury trials.

05:43.738 --> 05:44.839
That's why I'm bringing
somebody from the outside

05:44.839 --> 05:46.771
to head the unit.

05:46.838 --> 05:49.329
What schmo would
take that job ? Come on.

05:51.137 --> 05:54.204
Me a prosecutor ? No.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.371
Come on. 
Why not, huh ?

05:56.456 --> 05:58.057
I eat prosecutors
for breakfast.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.823
They're my main source
of fiber. Come on.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.356
Who better to shake up
the DA's unit ? Huh ?

06:01.423 --> 06:03.889
Winning is what you do
and it's what makes you the man.

06:03.956 --> 06:05.490
And I'd consider
this a personal favor.

06:05.556 --> 06:07.156
Jessica would
never go for it.

06:07.223 --> 06:09.790
I've got a 67%
approval rating.

06:09.857 --> 06:11.857
She's got editorials
screaming for her head.

06:11.922 --> 06:13.123
She'll do what I say.

06:13.189 --> 06:15.634
Manny, give me
one good reason

06:15.634 --> 06:17.256
I should even
consider this.

06:17.834 --> 06:18.761
I'll give you
three, <i>hermano.</i>

06:18.761 --> 06:21.167
You feel bad
about Deena Brock,

06:20.228 --> 06:22.893
you're sick of playing
on the wrong side,

06:22.893 --> 06:25.195
 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

06:41.460 --> 06:48.460

06:52.936 --> 06:59.936
<font color="#ffff00">sync:FRM@gadence</font>

07:03.234 --> 07:04.703
Sir, she's on the phone.

07:04.703 --> 07:07.031
Really ? Come on.

07:07.031 --> 07:08.260
Let's get this over with.

07:08.260 --> 07:10.635
Let me call you back.

07:10.702 --> 07:12.934
Welcome to the District
Attorney's office, Mr. Stark.

07:13.001 --> 07:14.568
Ms. Devlin.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.702
Well, this baby should get me
out of a few speeding tickets.

07:17.802 --> 07:19.967
Thank you.
Thank you.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.474
Do you mind telling me
what the hell you're up to ?

07:22.540 --> 07:23.707
Wow, look at these digs, huh ?

07:23.774 --> 07:24.941
Pretty good for a city employee.

07:25.006 --> 07:26.407
Comes with a great
parking spot, too.

07:26.474 --> 07:28.752
Unfortunately, some jerk
has parked in it.

07:28.752 --> 07:30.600
Wow, some people have
no respect, do they ?

07:30.600 --> 07:33.214
Hmm, look at that.
Terrible.

07:33.214 --> 07:34.784
So, what, you think you can
just waltz in here

07:34.784 --> 07:36.651
and cleanse your conscience
by putting away a few felons ?

07:36.718 --> 07:37.651
Hey, the Mayor asked for me.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.051
You know what I want, Jess ?

07:39.118 --> 07:40.418
I want us just to all be able
to get along.

07:40.484 --> 07:42.185
And I want the Rams
to come back to L.A.,

07:42.251 --> 07:44.085
but you know what ?
Not holding my breath.

07:44.151 --> 07:46.352
You know, I made my bones
humiliating this office

07:46.418 --> 07:47.718
on a daily basis

07:47.784 --> 07:49.517
but I want you to know
it was never personal.

07:49.584 --> 07:52.076
That's because for you,
the legal system's just a game

07:52.076 --> 07:53.051
to be played for fun
and profit.

07:53.118 --> 07:54.955
Do you mind ?
You know what ?
You make that sound

07:54.955 --> 07:57.420
like a bad thing.
Maybe not for a defense lawyer,

07:57.420 --> 07:59.151
but a Deputy DA represents
this city.

07:59.218 --> 08:00.664
And generally
not very well.

08:00.664 --> 08:02.227
You are a good attorney,

08:02.227 --> 08:03.919
but the people
in yr office, they...

08:03.919 --> 08:05.051
I don't know. What's the
word I'm looking for ?

08:05.118 --> 08:06.718
Oh, yeah, suck.

08:06.784 --> 08:08.118
Big trials require
a big gun.

08:08.185 --> 08:09.551
Oh, please,
you screwed up.

08:09.617 --> 08:10.718
We both know
that's why you're here.

08:10.784 --> 08:12.051
Oh.

08:12.118 --> 08:13.606
No matter how many criminals
you put away,

08:13.606 --> 08:15.551
Deena Brock's blood's
still going to be on your hands.

08:15.617 --> 08:16.851
Yeah, what about your hands,
Jess ?

08:16.918 --> 08:18.452
If this office
had the faintest clue how

08:18.517 --> 08:19.520
to mount an effective
prosecution,

08:19.520 --> 08:21.884
the guy'd still be in jail
and she'd still be alive.

08:21.951 --> 08:24.851
Well, this should be fun.

08:24.918 --> 08:27.018
Yeah. Mardi Gras.

08:27.085 --> 08:29.308
 <i>County of L.A. v.</i>
 <i>Jennifer Dennison.</i>

08:29.308 --> 08:30.352
Are you joking ?
That's a dog. Woof.

08:30.418 --> 08:31.551
Accused is a
20-year-old singer...

08:31.617 --> 08:32.664
Yeah, charged
with second-degree murder

08:32.664 --> 08:34.553
in the death of Terrence Rourke
at the Chateau Hotel.

08:34.553 --> 08:36.150
Accused claims
the victim raped her

08:36.160 --> 08:37.484
and she stabbed him
in self-defense.

08:37.551 --> 08:38.751
Am I supposed
to be impressed ?

08:38.818 --> 08:39.751
Guilty as sin,
you're right,

08:39.818 --> 08:41.150
but unwinnable.
Next.

08:41.217 --> 08:42.792
All right,
you listen to me.

08:42.792 --> 08:45.114
Delgado may have
forced me to hire you,

08:45.114 --> 08:46.953
but this is
my office.

08:46.953 --> 08:49.385
You prosecute
the cases I choose.

08:49.452 --> 08:50.452
Okay.

08:52.884 --> 08:54.751
What, the morgue
wasn't available ?

08:58.118 --> 09:00.118
Break a leg, Counselor.

09:00.185 --> 09:01.918
I hear he bribes jurors.

09:01.985 --> 09:03.751
Zero conscience.
He's scum.

09:03.818 --> 09:05.185
He won the Frye case

09:05.251 --> 09:07.185
by getting Judge Kranepool's
kid into Berkeley.

09:07.251 --> 09:08.651
That's completely
unethical.

09:08.718 --> 09:10.251
And the conviction rate
of this office

09:10.318 --> 09:11.484
is completely pathetic.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.551
And it was Harvard,
by the way.

09:13.617 --> 09:16.484
Well, it's clear you think
you know me,

09:16.551 --> 09:18.418
let's see what
I know about you.

09:18.484 --> 09:21.484
Richard "Casey" Woodland,
backup QB, USC.

09:21.551 --> 09:23.818
Dad's a state senator,
charming, good with a jury,

09:23.884 --> 09:25.951
weak on the facts,
not a rocket scientist.

09:26.018 --> 09:28.684
Billie Willis, smart,
passionate,

09:28.751 --> 09:30.718
lets emotion
cloud her judgment.

09:30.784 --> 09:31.918
Martin Alende...

09:31.985 --> 09:32.951
 <i>Allende.</i>

09:33.018 --> 09:34.118
 <i>Loyola Law Review.</i>

09:34.185 --> 09:35.452
Great on paper,
weak on his feet.

09:35.517 --> 09:37.285
Couldn't close a window.
And of course...

09:37.352 --> 09:38.385
Take your best shot.

09:38.452 --> 09:39.918
Raina Troy, tough, brilliant,

09:39.985 --> 09:41.951
and I used to <i>dream</i>
of getting you on a case.

09:42.018 --> 09:43.551
Major authority problem.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.118
A contempt citation
waiting to happen.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.100
Whatever.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.660
I rest my case.

09:47.660 --> 09:51.118
I have a dossier on every single
prosecutor in this building.

09:51.185 --> 09:52.838
Know thy enemy.

09:52.838 --> 09:53.651
Aren't we on
the same side now ?

09:53.718 --> 09:55.285
No, the jury's out,
isn't it ?

09:55.352 --> 09:56.985
But of course,
if the dragon lady
assigned you to me,

09:57.051 --> 09:58.352
I guess you're
on her hit list.

09:58.418 --> 09:59.553
That means you're 
damaged goods

09:59.553 --> 10:01.651
and that means that
we have something
in common.

10:01.718 --> 10:04.276
Madeleine Poe.
You're not on the list.

10:04.276 --> 10:05.051
I volunteered for the unit.

10:05.118 --> 10:06.684
Well, I appreciate that,
but you're not on the list.

10:06.751 --> 10:09.218
I graduated cum laude
from Stanford Law,

10:09.285 --> 10:10.684
clerked for the Ninth Circuit,

10:10.751 --> 10:12.584
and I've lead this office
in convictions

10:12.651 --> 10:13.884
for the last two years.

10:13.951 --> 10:15.985
I intend to become
a defense attorney,

10:16.051 --> 10:17.418
and I'm here to learn
from the best.

10:17.484 --> 10:18.651
Well, there you go,
sucking up...

10:18.718 --> 10:20.661
an effective
tactic. Sit.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.018
Thank you.
You know, people say that

10:22.085 --> 10:24.884
"high-priced defense attorneys"
beat prosecutors because

10:24.951 --> 10:27.851
it's easier to prove reasonable
doubt than certain guilt.

10:27.918 --> 10:31.251
But there's a simple explanation
for why I always win

10:31.318 --> 10:33.517
and you always lose...

10:33.584 --> 10:36.751
my vastly superior abilities
as a lawyer notwithstanding.

10:36.818 --> 10:39.584
A prosecutor
must conform his case

10:39.651 --> 10:41.784
to the demands
of the legal system.

10:41.851 --> 10:45.584
A defense attorney
conforms the legal system

10:45.651 --> 10:47.517
to the demands of his case.

10:47.584 --> 10:49.751
You want to win ?
Grab a pencil.

10:49.818 --> 10:52.185
I live by three simple rules...

10:52.251 --> 10:54.418
my cutthroat manifesto.

10:54.484 --> 10:58.751
These rules guide every single
decision I make

10:58.818 --> 11:00.651
on every single case.

11:00.718 --> 11:03.985
Rule number one : Trial is war,
second place is death.

11:04.051 --> 11:07.617
Rule number two:
Truth is relative.

11:07.684 --> 11:09.051
Pick one that works.

11:09.118 --> 11:11.018
Rule number three:

11:11.085 --> 11:14.452
In a jury trial, there are only
12 opinions that matter,

11:14.517 --> 11:18.517
and...Ms. Troy...yours most
decidedly is not one of them.

11:18.584 --> 11:20.285
Now from this day forward,

11:20.352 --> 11:22.985
every case will be
David versus Goliath.

11:23.051 --> 11:24.251
And guess who's
holding the slingshot ?

11:24.318 --> 11:26.951
Now, I have some bad news,

11:27.018 --> 11:28.617
and I have some truly
horrible news.

11:28.684 --> 11:30.985
The bad news is from one of
your lamer colleagues

11:31.051 --> 11:33.318
we have inherited
the Dennison case.

11:33.385 --> 11:34.784
The jury is lousy,

11:34.851 --> 11:37.285
the opposition has unlimited
resources.

11:37.352 --> 11:39.185
The truly horrible news...

11:39.251 --> 11:42.617
we go to trial in 48 hours.

11:42.684 --> 11:45.185
For this to work,
you must accept

11:45.251 --> 11:48.251
that winning is the only thing
that matters.

11:48.318 --> 11:49.418
What about justice ?
Hey.

11:49.484 --> 11:51.118
Your job is to win.

11:51.185 --> 11:53.185
Justice is God's problem.

11:53.251 --> 11:57.918
So, guys, you're either on
the bus or you're off the bus.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.218
Let's get to work.

11:59.285 --> 12:00.918
I've seen you on television.

12:00.985 --> 12:02.251
Occupational hazard.

12:02.318 --> 12:04.051
You represent criminals.

12:04.118 --> 12:05.418
Terry wasn't a criminal.

12:05.484 --> 12:06.684
Mrs. Rourke...

12:06.751 --> 12:07.884
I'm here to help you,

12:07.951 --> 12:09.452
so please tell me
about your son.

12:09.517 --> 12:12.218
Terry was a great kid.

12:12.285 --> 12:15.517
He always loved music
and photography.

12:15.584 --> 12:17.318
Shooting videos,
he could do both.

12:17.385 --> 12:20.251
Did Terry have
an active social life ?

12:20.318 --> 12:22.484
He dated a lot.

12:22.551 --> 12:23.751
Girls liked him.

12:23.818 --> 12:26.151
I have to ask.

12:26.218 --> 12:28.452
Was he in the habit of
having one-night stands ?

12:30.751 --> 12:32.452
Do you have children, Mr. Stark ?

12:32.517 --> 12:35.085
A 16-year-old daughter.

12:35.151 --> 12:37.884
Then you know once they
start to grow up,

12:37.951 --> 12:39.784
they don't always tell you
everything.

12:39.851 --> 12:41.851
Maybe you don't want to know.

12:41.918 --> 12:43.251
Just pray they're safe.

12:44.918 --> 12:47.484
I believe this girl murdered
your son.

12:47.551 --> 12:49.018
But I have to tell you,

12:49.085 --> 12:51.085
it's gonna be tough to
convince a jury of that.

12:51.151 --> 12:52.684
I understand.

12:52.751 --> 12:55.751
But the thing is...

12:55.818 --> 12:59.151
Terry could never have done
what she said he did.

12:59.218 --> 13:01.851
And if I'm going to find a way
to go on living,

13:01.918 --> 13:03.651
I need the world to know that.

13:03.718 --> 13:07.818
Well, then I'll have to restore
your son's reputation, won't I ?

13:09.784 --> 13:11.684
And I give you my word I will.

13:11.751 --> 13:15.318
Okay, Town Car picks up
Jenny Dennison at 6:00 a.m.,

13:15.385 --> 13:17.484
drops her at
a Burbank soundstage.

13:17.551 --> 13:19.584
She spends the next 15 hours
shooting a music video.

13:19.651 --> 13:21.767
Terrence Rourke
was a camera man
on the shoot.

13:21.767 --> 13:23.118
They got chummy,
went out for drinks

13:23.185 --> 13:25.684
and landed back at the Chateau
at 2:15 a.m.

13:25.751 --> 13:27.352
Alcohol impugns
her credibility.

13:27.418 --> 13:29.185
She asked him to leave,
he refused.

13:29.251 --> 13:30.484
He got sexually aggressive,

13:30.551 --> 13:31.985
pushed her down on
the bed and raped her.

13:32.051 --> 13:33.318
Her medical exam
shows no evidence

13:33.385 --> 13:34.352
of forced intercourse.

13:34.418 --> 13:35.617
Or any defensive wounds

13:35.684 --> 13:37.385
indicating a violent struggle.

13:37.452 --> 13:39.118
Well, if Rourke didn't rape
her, why'd she kill him ?

13:39.185 --> 13:40.851
You're just like a guided
missile, aren't you ?

13:40.918 --> 13:42.452
Straight to the heart
of the case.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.352
Okay... strategy.

13:44.418 --> 13:47.018
First, we've got to implode
Jenny Dennison's case.

13:47.085 --> 13:48.584
We want the jury to say
to themselves

13:48.651 --> 13:50.584
"How does a guy with no history
of violence whatsoever

13:50.651 --> 13:51.784
become some mad rapist ?"

13:51.851 --> 13:53.285
We got to create our own truth.

13:53.352 --> 13:55.951
So, here's Terrence Rourke,
shows up on the set,

13:56.018 --> 13:57.960
meets a cute girl,
asks her out for a date,

13:57.960 --> 13:59.178
they have a few too many drinks,

13:59.178 --> 14:00.505
they get into
a drunken argument,

14:00.505 --> 14:01.385
Jenny settles it with a knife.

14:01.452 --> 14:02.684
The existing prep work

14:02.751 --> 14:04.318
on this case is atrocious.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.418
Start over.

14:05.484 --> 14:06.718
Assignments.
Madeleine...

14:06.784 --> 14:08.218
all the dirt on Jenny.

14:08.285 --> 14:10.218
Uh, boyfriends,
friends, relatives.

14:10.285 --> 14:11.651
Billie, same thing
on Terrence Rourke.

14:11.718 --> 14:12.985
Raina, forensics.

14:13.051 --> 14:15.251
The CSU and
the M.E.'s reports...

14:15.318 --> 14:16.285
Are just the beginning.

14:16.352 --> 14:18.218
Be creative, dig deeper.
Martin,

14:18.285 --> 14:19.851
you're gonna go to the
Chateau, ask for Reid.

14:19.918 --> 14:21.251
R-E-I-D.
He's the assistant manager.

14:21.318 --> 14:22.517
Tell him I sent you

14:22.584 --> 14:23.851
and you give him
this, okay ?

14:24.125 --> 14:25.718
Now, check out Jenny's story,

14:25.784 --> 14:26.784
the whole crime scene.

14:26.851 --> 14:28.151
Follow in her footsteps,

14:28.218 --> 14:30.185
find the holes in the case.
Let's get going.

14:30.251 --> 14:31.452
What about me ?
Oh, yeah.

14:31.517 --> 14:33.151
I want you to go down to
Jensen's

14:33.218 --> 14:34.784
and get a double order
of cheese fries.

14:34.851 --> 14:36.352
You're joking, right ?

14:36.418 --> 14:38.551
Did I chuckle ?
You're gonna bring the fries

14:38.617 --> 14:39.985
to Jurors' Bailiff Ray Sabado.

14:40.051 --> 14:41.718
Ray's in charge of the jurors
on this case.

14:41.784 --> 14:43.818
Two things he loves more than
life itself:

14:43.884 --> 14:46.484
He loves yakking with the jurors
and he loves to eat.

14:46.551 --> 14:48.784
That bag of fries
is gonna buy us more insight

14:48.851 --> 14:50.551
than ten jury consultants, okay ?

14:50.617 --> 14:52.418
Uh, that's prosecutorial
misconduct.

14:52.484 --> 14:54.051
Well, we'll just have to be
brave on this one.

14:54.118 --> 14:57.684
We have to prove that Terrence
Rourke was a victim of murder.

14:57.751 --> 15:01.884
We need to make that jury
hear his voice.

15:01.951 --> 15:03.718
WOMAN:
 <i>So how's the new job going ?</i>

15:03.784 --> 15:05.285
I've had better days.

15:05.352 --> 15:08.617
Larry just got
himself a new gig.

15:08.684 --> 15:10.285
Head of anesthesiology.

15:10.352 --> 15:12.418
Can he put me
out of my misery ?
He's about to.

15:12.484 --> 15:14.918
You just wrote your last
alimony check.

15:14.985 --> 15:17.584
We're engaged.

15:21.185 --> 15:24.718
Is that for my happiness
or the alimony ?

15:24.784 --> 15:26.218
Yes.

15:26.285 --> 15:27.484
There's more.

15:27.551 --> 15:28.784
Larry's new job

15:28.851 --> 15:31.018
is in New York.

15:31.085 --> 15:32.617
Oh.

15:32.684 --> 15:34.452
There's a great private
school for Julie there.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.151
The custody hearing
will be over by then.

15:36.218 --> 15:37.352
Timing seems good.

15:37.418 --> 15:38.651
What do you think ?

15:38.718 --> 15:40.784
I... I mean, you...

15:40.851 --> 15:43.751
obviously thought this
all out and...

15:43.818 --> 15:46.118
you always seem to know
what's best for Julie...

15:46.185 --> 15:47.784
It'll be great for her.

15:47.851 --> 15:50.285
And, hey, we always talked about
moving to New York one day.

15:50.352 --> 15:51.584
Remember ?
Yeah, right.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.918
But this is a slightly
different version.

15:53.985 --> 15:55.385
Did you tell him ?

15:55.452 --> 15:56.484
I told him.

15:56.551 --> 15:58.484
Pretty freaky, huh ?
Yeah.

15:58.551 --> 16:00.418
Yeah, pretty freaky.

16:00.484 --> 16:02.418
But you're still gonna come
visit us, right ?

16:02.484 --> 16:04.285
I mean, I know you're always
swamped...

16:04.352 --> 16:05.718
Oh, you kidding ?
No, I mean,

16:05.784 --> 16:07.517
hey, we'll, you know,
hit the Broadway shows,

16:07.584 --> 16:10.018
we'll watch the Knicks lose.

16:10.085 --> 16:12.118
Yeah, no, it-it...

16:12.185 --> 16:13.452
It'll be great.

16:13.517 --> 16:14.718
Great.

16:20.151 --> 16:21.452
Yeah.

16:21.517 --> 16:23.584
Good.

16:23.651 --> 16:24.951
Okay.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.352
So...

16:26.418 --> 16:28.584
we'll let you
get some work done.

16:41.851 --> 16:43.418
Sweetie...

16:53.140 --> 16:54.424
Good night.

17:12.428 --> 17:13.531
 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

17:13.531 --> 17:14.598
G
ed
 <i>to make myself clear.</i>

17:14.598 --> 17:16.031
We're fighting the clock, guys.

17:15.897 --> 17:17.865
It's only been 24 hours.

17:17.932 --> 17:19.598
AKA half the allotted time.

17:19.665 --> 17:22.298
Your stuff on
the victim is thin.

17:22.364 --> 17:24.298
And your forensics overview
is like

17:24.364 --> 17:26.731
every high school class
I ever failed, Raina.

17:26.798 --> 17:29.197
You, Martin, you interviewed
the room service guy

17:29.264 --> 17:30.231
but none of the maids

17:30.298 --> 17:31.498
on Jenny's floor ?

17:31.565 --> 17:32.798
And what about
Bailiff Sabado ?

17:32.865 --> 17:33.898
He was sick yesterday.

17:33.965 --> 17:34.998
And when you went to his house ?

17:35.064 --> 17:35.932
Just tell me you went
to his house.

17:35.998 --> 17:37.032
He said he's contagious.

17:37.097 --> 17:38.431
Well, you better
hope he dies.

17:38.498 --> 17:39.565
I take that back.
But anyway, look,

17:39.631 --> 17:40.665
the only good thing here
is your stuff

17:40.731 --> 17:42.965
on Jennifer Dennison.
That is good.

17:43.032 --> 17:44.965
We need more stuff
like that if we're gonna

17:45.032 --> 17:46.264
clear Terrence Rourke's name.

17:46.331 --> 17:48.197
That's what it's gonna take
to win.

17:48.264 --> 17:49.998
That is why we're here.

17:50.064 --> 17:51.231
Okay.

17:56.298 --> 17:57.331
Hey.

17:57.398 --> 17:59.565
Hey, Julie.

18:02.064 --> 18:03.264
That's my dad.

18:03.331 --> 18:05.531
I'll call you guys later.

18:05.598 --> 18:07.965
Hey.

18:08.032 --> 18:09.331
Is Mom okay ?

18:09.398 --> 18:11.097
Why wouldn't she be ?

18:11.164 --> 18:12.665
Well, why else
would you be here ?

18:12.731 --> 18:13.831
I was in the neighborhood.

18:13.898 --> 18:15.831
Why, is it so bizarre
for me to stop by ?

18:15.898 --> 18:18.064
You haven't visited me at
school since the third grade.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.898
So, yeah, this falls under
the bizarre category.

18:19.965 --> 18:21.831
Fine, you want to grab
a bite to eat ?

18:21.898 --> 18:23.298
What about your case ?

18:23.364 --> 18:25.032
Oh, the evidentiary hearing
got bumped till 4:00.

18:25.097 --> 18:26.531
I got a couple hours, so...

18:26.598 --> 18:27.674
Are you sure Mom's okay ?

18:27.674 --> 18:28.335
 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

18:28.335 --> 18:30.565
You know, I thought with you
leaving soon we might hang out

18:30.631 --> 18:33.331
a little bit, but if you don't
want, I can eat a Power Bar...

18:33.398 --> 18:34.798
That's not what I said.

18:34.865 --> 18:37.164
Look, the thing is, I was just
headed down to Melrose.

18:37.231 --> 18:39.464
Oh, that's good, because I need
a new pair of leather chaps.

18:39.531 --> 18:40.998
Well, actually...

18:41.064 --> 18:42.531
You ready to go ?

18:42.598 --> 18:44.097
Dad, this is Jared.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.131
Hi.
Pleasure to meet
you, Mr. Stark.

18:46.197 --> 18:47.498
Jared.

18:47.565 --> 18:49.064
Caught the Brock trial
on Court TV.

18:49.131 --> 18:51.164
It was a killer cross
on the neighbor chick.

18:51.231 --> 18:54.064
Yeah, thanks. That didn't
work out so well, as
it turned out, but...

18:54.131 --> 18:55.264
Dad.
Yeah.

18:55.331 --> 18:57.231
Jared, you know,
my dad and I are...

18:57.298 --> 18:58.998
No, sweetie, it's okay.
You two go.

18:59.064 --> 19:00.364
Okay, I'll see you
later.
Are you sure ?

19:00.431 --> 19:01.464
I'll catch you later.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.064
Good meeting you, sir.
You, too.

19:11.197 --> 19:13.565
Okay, how about
she's got me stuck

19:13.631 --> 19:14.932
in the damn
storage closet ?

19:14.998 --> 19:16.164
I'm surprised she let
you out for lunch.

19:16.231 --> 19:17.531
Foxy, what are you doing here ?

19:17.598 --> 19:19.298
He's head of my Council
on Physical Fitness.

19:19.364 --> 19:20.331
Oh, couldn't get Magic ?

19:20.398 --> 19:21.831
Oh... 

19:21.898 --> 19:23.097
you're funny.

19:23.164 --> 19:25.264
I hear I might need
to find a new lawyer.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.331
I'll get you some names.

19:26.398 --> 19:27.932
How about Anita Astin ?

19:27.998 --> 19:30.889
Outstanding.
Apparently, Defiance
Records agrees.

19:30.889 --> 19:33.032
I hear they're about to bring
her in to represent
Jenny Dennison.

19:33.097 --> 19:35.131
That's not good.

19:35.197 --> 19:36.531
She as tough
as they say ?

19:36.598 --> 19:37.698
Tougher.

19:37.765 --> 19:39.965
Didn't you two have
a little thing ?

19:40.032 --> 19:41.197
Once.

19:41.264 --> 19:43.631
Well, twice, actually.

19:43.698 --> 19:44.965
How'd it end ?

19:45.032 --> 19:47.097
Not well.
Hmm.

19:48.977 --> 19:51.798
Involuntary manslaughter.
Five years. She's out in two.

19:51.865 --> 19:53.264
You run this past the DA ?

19:53.331 --> 19:54.665
It's a great deal, Jenny.
Take it.

19:54.731 --> 19:57.097
Are we talking
about jail-jail

19:57.164 --> 19:58.798
or Martha Stewart jail ?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.398
Uh, we could work something out.

20:00.464 --> 20:02.264
The offer's declined.
You sure, Jenny ?

20:02.331 --> 20:05.231
Because if you get convicted,
you could die in prison.

20:05.298 --> 20:06.698
The offer is declined.

20:06.765 --> 20:08.631
I need to speak
to Mr. Stark.

20:08.698 --> 20:10.698
Come on.

20:12.831 --> 20:14.765
Man, you like to roll the dice,
don't you ?

20:14.831 --> 20:16.631
You think, what, I'm some
state school prosecutor with

20:16.698 --> 20:19.131
30 cases in the fire ? You're
taking a hell of a chance.

20:19.197 --> 20:21.197
I know, but it'll be
so much more fun

20:21.264 --> 20:23.431
kicking the shark's ass.
Don't call me that,
I hate that.

20:23.498 --> 20:25.264
Oh, it's not like
I haven't seen your fin.

20:25.331 --> 20:26.565
Oh, you'd reject
a primo deal,

20:26.631 --> 20:28.464
what, to settle an old score
between us ?

20:28.531 --> 20:30.464
Oh, don't flatter yourself.
I know your M.O.

20:30.531 --> 20:32.264
You've got squat
or you wouldn't be dealing.

20:32.331 --> 20:33.698
Maybe your client
deserves a break.

20:33.765 --> 20:36.097
Oh, so now you're the prosecutor
with a heart ?

20:36.164 --> 20:37.765
Please, you're a disgrace.

20:37.831 --> 20:38.898
I'm sensing some hostility.

20:38.965 --> 20:40.364
Yeah, you hopped the fence.

20:40.431 --> 20:41.865
Like being a defense attorney

20:41.932 --> 20:43.498
is something you need
to rehab from.

20:43.565 --> 20:44.731
Maybe it is.

20:44.798 --> 20:45.731
Your client went bad,

20:45.798 --> 20:46.765
you melted down.

20:46.831 --> 20:48.097
You sold out your partners,

20:48.164 --> 20:50.164
you sold out your profession,
and now, Stark,

20:50.231 --> 20:52.598
I'm gonna beat you like
an African drum.

20:56.197 --> 20:58.264
You got something
big, right ?

20:58.331 --> 20:59.965
I'll see you in court.

21:02.998 --> 21:04.531
Well, maybe they found
an eyewitness.

21:04.598 --> 21:06.197
They'd have to be
on the list.

21:06.264 --> 21:08.631
New forensics ?
The defense hasn't
hired an expert.

21:08.698 --> 21:12.464
Oh, hey, thanks for joining us.
I hired a Web monitoring
service to keep us posted

21:12.531 --> 21:13.798
on all things Jenny.

21:13.865 --> 21:14.831
Well, there you go.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.331
Score one for Mr. Law Review.

21:16.398 --> 21:17.998
And the winner is ?

21:18.064 --> 21:19.798
Sexstacy.net.

21:24.631 --> 21:27.164
Oh, God, is that... ?

21:27.231 --> 21:28.712
Jenny Dennison
and Terrence Rourke

21:28.712 --> 21:30.070
minutes before
she killed him.

21:30.070 --> 21:32.364
So much for Jenny
being the innocent victim.

21:32.431 --> 21:34.780
BILLIE:
Now that sex is
definitely consensual.

21:34.780 --> 21:36.731
Kind of hot, too.
This thing's
a slam-dunk.

21:36.798 --> 21:38.765
This thing's a train wreck.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.831
Five minutes ago we had
a rape defense based

21:40.898 --> 21:42.698
on weak physical evidence.

21:42.765 --> 21:44.698
Now we've got Paris Hilton 2.

21:44.765 --> 21:46.531
Some sleazy Romeo
with a hidden camcorder

21:46.598 --> 21:48.865
trying to get rich off
a sex tape. That's terrific.

21:48.932 --> 21:52.164
Since when is secretly taping
sex punishable by murder ?

21:52.231 --> 21:53.731
Since rule number three.

21:53.798 --> 21:55.865
Jury trials are
not about the law,

21:55.932 --> 21:58.231
they're about what 12 people
think is right.

21:58.298 --> 22:00.875
Anita will turn that tape
into rape

22:00.875 --> 22:02.558
by humiliation.

22:02.965 --> 22:04.990
Do you think winning
this thing was tough before ?

22:04.990 --> 22:07.607
 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

22:10.652 --> 22:11.555
 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

22:11.555 --> 22:12.916
 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

22:12.916 --> 22:14.516
I mean, everyone
is talking about it.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.750
You watched it ?

22:15.816 --> 22:17.350
Yeah. I mean, it was
really creepy.

22:17.417 --> 22:19.417
One second they're going at it,
and the next...

22:19.484 --> 22:21.217
No, you're too young
for that stuff, okay ?

22:21.283 --> 22:22.916
Oh, come on, Dad,
that's like PG-13

22:22.983 --> 22:25.250
compared to some of the porn
floating around on the Web.

22:25.317 --> 22:27.583
Oh, so what, now you know all
about sex, is that it ?

22:27.649 --> 22:28.983
I know enough.

22:29.050 --> 22:31.150
Yeah ?
Enough for what ?

22:31.217 --> 22:32.716
Are you asking if
I'm a virgin ?

22:33.750 --> 22:34.883
No, I'm not.

22:34.950 --> 22:36.117
'Cause all my friends' dads

22:36.183 --> 22:37.384
are really sphinctered out
about it.

22:37.450 --> 22:39.750
You got your mom,
you got your shrink.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.916
Knowing would totally
wig you out.
Exactly.

22:42.983 --> 22:45.450
Look, I want you to promise me
you will never be in

22:45.516 --> 22:47.649
a hotel room with a man
unless A) you're married

22:47.716 --> 22:50.217
B) I'm dead or C) both.

22:50.283 --> 22:52.083
Well, you know, there's this one
really hot guy

22:52.150 --> 22:53.277
I'm dying to go out with.

22:53.277 --> 22:54.641
Yeah, but I don't
really have a need

22:54.641 --> 22:56.916
to know that, okay ?
Dad, will you have dinner
with me tonight ?

22:56.983 --> 22:58.117
A make-up date
for the other day.

22:58.183 --> 23:00.417
Okay, but I got to warn you,

23:00.484 --> 23:03.017
I'm not cheap
and I'm not easy.

23:04.417 --> 23:06.484
Mrs. Rourke, was
your son Terrence
prone to violence ?

23:06.549 --> 23:08.649
It wasn't in his nature.

23:08.716 --> 23:10.083
But he did enjoy a reputation

23:10.150 --> 23:11.583
as something
of a ladies' man, right ?

23:11.649 --> 23:13.916
You can ask any girl
he ever went out with.

23:13.983 --> 23:15.417
Terry was a gentleman.

23:15.484 --> 23:16.616
Thank you.

23:16.683 --> 23:18.450
No further questions,
Your Honor.

23:22.250 --> 23:25.350
First, let me extend
my deepest sympathy

23:25.417 --> 23:26.783
for the loss of your son.

23:26.850 --> 23:28.317
Thank you.

23:28.384 --> 23:30.983
Would you describe Terrence
to be a stable young man ?

23:31.050 --> 23:32.983
Absolutely.
Yet he spent

23:33.050 --> 23:36.183
three weeks in New Days
treatment center in 2001.

23:36.250 --> 23:37.283
MRS. ROURKE:
Terry, uh...

23:37.350 --> 23:40.183
had a problem
with alcohol

23:40.250 --> 23:41.284
and painkillers.

23:41.284 --> 23:44.183
Your son's records show that
he was physically abusive

23:44.250 --> 23:45.384
to a nurse.

23:45.450 --> 23:47.750
Your Honor...
May I finish
my question ?

23:47.816 --> 23:51.083
Did your son have an altercation
with Nurse Gina Hathaway

23:51.150 --> 23:53.150
on August 7, 2001 ?

23:53.217 --> 23:54.683
That was a misunderstanding.

23:54.750 --> 23:56.017
Objection. Hearsay.

23:56.083 --> 23:56.850
Overruled.

23:56.916 --> 23:58.983
Please answer.

23:59.050 --> 24:00.850
She took away his journal.

24:00.916 --> 24:02.649
And Terrence was
subsequently moved

24:02.716 --> 24:06.117
to a ward with exclusively
male nurses ?

24:06.183 --> 24:08.583
Yes.

24:10.083 --> 24:11.683
You missed rehab ?
It was a voluntary
commitment.

24:11.750 --> 24:12.750
If I'd had more time...

24:12.816 --> 24:13.916
Anita had one day
on this case

24:13.983 --> 24:14.916
and she came up
with it.

24:14.983 --> 24:15.580
What were
you thinking ?

24:15.580 --> 24:17.512
I'm sorry.
I did the best I could.

24:17.512 --> 24:18.950
You know what,
it's not your fault,
it's my fault.

24:19.017 --> 24:20.405
In between writing
three briefs,

24:20.405 --> 24:22.484
putting together
my witness list,
formulating my direct,

24:22.549 --> 24:24.724
I should have found time
to do your job, too.
Look, she apologized...

24:24.724 --> 24:25.892
Do you mind ?
I don't need you
to defend me.

24:25.892 --> 24:27.417
There is no defense
for mediocrity.

24:27.484 --> 24:29.484
I've been up
for 32 hours.

24:29.549 --> 24:31.750
I interviewed his friends,
his family, his teachers.

24:31.816 --> 24:33.150
You want a merit badge ?

24:33.217 --> 24:36.883
In jury trials, you don't get
a second chance.

24:36.950 --> 24:39.083
Your incompetence has
put us in a major hole.

24:39.150 --> 24:43.017
If I'm such a
major screw-up...
Mm-hmm.

24:43.083 --> 24:44.716
...why don't you fire me ?

24:44.783 --> 24:46.649
That's the first helpful
suggestion you've had.

24:46.716 --> 24:48.484
Good luck with
the rest of your career.

24:53.083 --> 24:55.783
And you are on deck.

24:56.816 --> 24:58.211
DEVLIN:
 <i>You fired her ?</i>

24:58.211 --> 24:59.988
You don't have
the authority to fire her.

24:59.988 --> 25:01.916
Gone.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.334
See, this
is a problem.

25:03.399 --> 25:04.633
You don't play well
with others.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.700
So there's no
"team"in "I."

25:06.766 --> 25:08.433
What do you want
from me ?

25:08.499 --> 25:10.000
You know what,
she torpedoed my case,

25:10.067 --> 25:11.267
she got what
she deserved.

25:11.334 --> 25:14.466
Listen, let me put you
out of your misery.

25:14.533 --> 25:16.399
Your team can
finish this up.

25:16.466 --> 25:18.319
You can go back to your
million dollar retainers,

25:18.319 --> 25:19.499
your cherry-picked cases

25:19.566 --> 25:21.433
and just forget
this ever happened.

25:21.499 --> 25:23.733
I never walk out
in the middle of a movie.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.833
Yeah, I've seen this one.
You die in the end.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.067
The hero never dies.

25:27.133 --> 25:30.466
You're not exactly
hero material.

25:30.533 --> 25:33.466
Jess, I promised
Elizabeth Rourke

25:33.533 --> 25:35.733
I would clear
her son's name.

25:37.234 --> 25:39.967
Well, you're off
to a flying start.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.733
Billie, come on.
He didn't mean it.

25:44.800 --> 25:45.966
Sure he did.

25:46.033 --> 25:47.534
The guy is a major-league
head case.

25:47.599 --> 25:49.500
Technically, Devlin's
the only one who can fire you.

25:49.566 --> 25:52.133
She's not exactly
one of my biggest fans.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.766
For God's sake,
just let her go.

25:54.833 --> 25:56.933
I'm sorry if I don't join
the pity party,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
but Stark was right--
she blew it.

25:59.067 --> 26:00.699
Rourke's friends knew he had
a drug problem

26:00.766 --> 26:02.233
and she didn't ask
the right questions.

26:02.300 --> 26:03.933
Would you
repeat that ?

26:04.000 --> 26:05.599
With your head so far
up Stark's ass,

26:05.666 --> 26:06.833
your voice is
kind of muffled.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.333
I'm doing my job.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.866
You should give it a try.

26:09.933 --> 26:11.666
God, Madeleine.

26:11.733 --> 26:15.167
We all know that you're
God's gift to litigation.

26:15.233 --> 26:16.400
You guys really
don't get it.

26:16.467 --> 26:18.167
Despite your glaring
deficiencies,

26:18.233 --> 26:20.133
or rather because of them,

26:20.200 --> 26:22.434
you're being given
an incredible opportunity

26:22.500 --> 26:25.866
to prosecute every high-profile
case in this city.

26:25.933 --> 26:27.500
If you'd stop whining
for two minutes,

26:27.566 --> 26:30.206
you'd realize there's not
a lawyer in this building

26:30.206 --> 26:32.800
who wouldn't trade places
with you in a heartbeat.

26:34.400 --> 26:35.633
Hello.

26:35.699 --> 26:37.633
Yeah, okay, got it.

26:37.699 --> 26:38.900
That was Stark.

26:38.966 --> 26:40.500
He wants us at his place... now.

26:45.100 --> 26:49.133
Madeleine is an obnoxious,
ass-kissing twit.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.966
But she's right.

26:51.033 --> 26:53.500
This is the chance
of a lifetime.

26:53.566 --> 26:56.866
Not for me.

27:01.267 --> 27:03.599
So did you guys take
the bus here, or what ?

27:03.666 --> 27:05.000
I'm just curious.

27:05.067 --> 27:07.900
Nice place.
Thank you.

27:07.966 --> 27:09.666
You've got to be
kidding me.

27:09.733 --> 27:12.033
This place
is beautiful,

27:12.100 --> 27:13.599
and it looks like
it's got everything.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.000
Except a conscience.

27:15.067 --> 27:17.989
Let me guess--
regulation indoor court ?
Exactly.

27:17.989 --> 27:21.538
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is where the magic happens.

27:21.538 --> 27:22.927
Sweet home.

27:22.927 --> 27:24.723
The panels you're walking on
covered the floor

27:24.723 --> 27:27.100
of the United States
Supreme Court for 68 years.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.405
This thing's seen
better days.

27:28.405 --> 27:30.895
Oh, it looked a lot better
when Clarence Darrow sat in it

27:30.895 --> 27:33.100
during the Scopes Monkey Trial.

27:33.167 --> 27:35.800
That lamp was on
Ito's desk during OJ.

27:35.866 --> 27:38.634
This jury box is from the set
of <i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

27:38.634 --> 27:40.109
You don't get enough
of the courtroom
during trial ?

27:40.109 --> 27:42.333
Not surprisingly,
you miss the point entirely.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.800
Trials are won before you ever
step foot in the courtroom.

27:45.866 --> 27:49.940
There are eight cameras,
real-time polling technology

27:49.940 --> 27:51.167
for mock jurors,

27:51.233 --> 27:54.666
the same voice analysis system
used by the FBI at Quantico.

27:54.733 --> 27:57.329
I never make an argument
in open court

27:57.329 --> 28:00.033
before it has been perfected
in this room.

28:00.100 --> 28:02.310
Now, guys, we got
one shot at this case.

28:02.310 --> 28:05.033
Destroy Jenny Dennison
on the stand.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.000
We must convince the jury

28:07.067 --> 28:09.137
that she was this predatory
little slut

28:09.137 --> 28:11.639
who lured Terrence Rourke
into her hotel room,

28:11.639 --> 28:14.666
got into a lovers' quarrel
and killed him in cold blood.

28:14.733 --> 28:16.714
How can we be sure the defense
will put Jenny on the stand ?

28:16.714 --> 28:18.500
'Cause Anita still has
to prove self-defense.

28:18.566 --> 28:19.715
Jenny's needs the only
living witness.

28:19.725 --> 28:21.225
RAINA:
Slamming the victim
in a sex trial

28:21.292 --> 28:23.650
can backfire,
Especially if the
prosecutor is a guy.

28:23.650 --> 28:26.176
That's why I'm not going to
question Jenny. You are.

28:26.307 --> 28:28.574
We're going to put some
of that patented
hostility to work.

28:28.641 --> 28:31.062
I won't attack a defendant
without foundation

28:31.062 --> 28:32.354
in order to prejudice the jury.

28:32.354 --> 28:33.946
CASEY:
She's right, it's an ugly
tactic. And it looks desperate.

28:33.946 --> 28:36.320
I don't know if you've
noticed this yet, guys,

28:36.387 --> 28:37.320
we are desperate.

28:37.387 --> 28:39.887
Rule number one...trial is war.

28:39.953 --> 28:41.720
And war tends to get ugly.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.820
I'll do it.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.030
I have no problem
tearing Barbie's head off.

28:45.030 --> 28:45.887
Why does that
not surprise me ?

28:45.887 --> 28:47.985
A smart defendant like Jenny

28:47.985 --> 28:49.653
is not going to lose it
on the stand.
Oh, really ?

28:49.720 --> 28:51.260
I'll tell you what--
just for kicks and giggles,

28:51.260 --> 28:53.054
why don't you...
May I, please ?

28:53.120 --> 28:54.287
...step into
the witness box.

28:54.354 --> 28:56.320
And, guys, you get
in the jury box. Come on.

28:56.387 --> 28:57.320
Judge Margaret.

28:57.387 --> 28:59.387
You're sworn,

28:59.454 --> 29:03.720
charged with killing a man
you just had sex with.

29:03.787 --> 29:06.153
Ms. Troy, how old are you ?
29.

29:06.153 --> 29:08.267
How many men
have you had sex with ?
What ?

29:08.267 --> 29:08.887
Your Honor ?

29:08.953 --> 29:09.887
The witness will answer.

29:09.953 --> 29:11.521
I have no idea.

29:11.586 --> 29:13.354
More than 50 ?
I don't... Of course not...

29:13.459 --> 29:14.753
30 ? Am I
getting closer ?

29:14.820 --> 29:16.154
You may keep a running count,
but I don't.

29:16.220 --> 29:17.820
Have you ever contracted
a venereal disease ?

29:17.887 --> 29:20.728
Have you ever
contracted a
venereal disease ?

29:20.728 --> 29:21.054
Once.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.007
In college.

29:22.007 --> 29:23.820
So you enjoy
unprotected sex ?
I was 20 years old.

29:23.887 --> 29:25.354
Ever engage in S&M ?

29:25.421 --> 29:27.580
Bondage ?
Sex with another woman ?

29:27.580 --> 29:28.087
Multiple partners ?
Know what ? I'm done.

29:28.154 --> 29:29.820
Is that a crucifix
around your neck ?

29:29.887 --> 29:32.020
Don't go there.
Are you a
practicing Christian ?
Yes.

29:32.087 --> 29:33.263
Would you say that you
understand

29:33.263 --> 29:34.187
the teachings of your church ?

29:34.254 --> 29:35.454
How do you reconcile
those teachings

29:35.521 --> 29:36.931
with your wanton
promiscuity ?

29:36.931 --> 29:39.120
You don't know the first thing
about me !

29:39.187 --> 29:40.987
You may live in a fancy mansion,

29:41.054 --> 29:43.131
but you are still a low-rent
ambulance-chasing

29:43.131 --> 29:45.087
son of a bitch.

29:50.154 --> 29:52.421
No more questions, Your Honor.

29:52.487 --> 29:53.820
You may step down.

29:53.887 --> 29:55.720
Okay, guys, I'll be
back in two hours.

29:55.787 --> 29:58.354
And when I return, I want to
see Jennifer Dennison's

29:58.421 --> 30:00.421
entrails hanging from
that chandelier

30:00.487 --> 30:03.287
right next to Ms. Troy's.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.987
Thanks for the picture, huh ?
Sure.

30:09.054 --> 30:10.787
So what do you think ?

30:10.853 --> 30:14.487
I think, uh... About what ?

30:14.588 --> 30:15.860
About Honors French ?

30:15.860 --> 30:17.667
Oh, uh, look, it seems to me

30:17.667 --> 30:18.757
that you want
to learn French,

30:18.757 --> 30:19.767
that we should get you
an apartment in Paris...

30:19.767 --> 30:21.211
But, Dad, I'm talking about
looking good

30:21.211 --> 30:22.953
on college applications.
Sorry. Yes.

30:23.020 --> 30:24.637
No. Good, that's much better.

30:24.637 --> 30:25.686
Use the stuff
with the boyfriend.

30:25.753 --> 30:28.586
It's great. Yes, great.

30:28.653 --> 30:31.887
I'll be...
I'll be back soon. Bye.

30:31.953 --> 30:33.920
Electronic handcuff.

30:33.987 --> 30:36.187
So we were.... Where were we ?

30:36.254 --> 30:38.220
Oh, <i>en France.</i>
Know what ?

30:38.287 --> 30:39.553
We should probably
just go.

30:39.620 --> 30:40.553
You're really busy.

30:40.620 --> 30:41.571
No, Julie, I'm...

30:41.571 --> 30:43.085
It's fine. I'm not mad.

30:43.085 --> 30:44.553
In fact, I couldn't think

30:44.620 --> 30:46.154
of a more appropriate way
to say good-bye.

30:46.220 --> 30:49.820
Don't say that...
Dad, I never fit
into your life.

30:49.887 --> 30:52.753
Now I can finally stop trying.

30:54.020 --> 30:57.787
You know, when
that lady died
and you lost it,

30:57.853 --> 31:00.387
I really thought you'd changed.

31:01.212 --> 31:05.959
 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

31:14.625 --> 31:17.242
 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

31:17.242 --> 31:20.009
He said, "I just
made you a star."
JENNY:Y:

31:20.076 --> 31:21.405
I had no idea what he meant.

31:21.305 --> 31:23.609
Then he showed me his camera.

31:23.676 --> 31:25.875
He filmed your lovemaking ?

31:25.942 --> 31:28.409
He must have brought
the camera with him.
JENNY:

31:28.476 --> 31:29.909
Set it up when
I wasn't looking.

31:29.975 --> 31:31.209
And what happened next ?

31:31.276 --> 31:33.276
I told Terry
to give me the tape.

31:33.343 --> 31:35.309
He laughedn my face.

31:35.376 --> 31:38.142
Pinned me down
on the bed.

31:38.209 --> 31:39.942
I kept thinking about
my parents--

31:40.009 --> 31:41.476
how much this
would hurt them.

31:41.543 --> 31:43.710
That's when I spotted
the knife.

31:43.776 --> 31:45.176
And what did you do ?

31:45.242 --> 31:47.109
I grabbed the knife.

31:47.176 --> 31:49.842
And I swung it.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.842
Did you call
911 right away ?

31:51.909 --> 31:52.393
JENNY:
Yes.

31:52.393 --> 31:55.543
Ms. Dennison, why didn't
the police find the tape ?

31:55.609 --> 31:58.176
Before they came, I went
to my manager's room,

31:58.242 --> 31:59.476
gave her the tape.

31:59.543 --> 32:01.875
I didn't want anyone to see it.

32:01.942 --> 32:04.343
Now it's everywhere.

32:04.409 --> 32:06.676
No further questions.

32:06.743 --> 32:09.142
I'm going to start
with the high school stuff
and build from there.

32:09.209 --> 32:11.543
JUDGE:
Does the prosecution wish
to cross-examine the witness ?

32:18.276 --> 32:20.509
Mr. Stark,
do you wish

32:20.576 --> 32:22.209
to question this witness ?

32:22.276 --> 32:25.142
We have no questions,
Your Honor.

32:30.842 --> 32:33.286
I saw Jenny Dennison...I didn't
see a guilty defendant.

32:33.286 --> 32:36.009
I saw a troubled young girl.
I saw...

32:36.076 --> 32:37.076
Julie.

32:38.109 --> 32:40.409
But she killed somebody.

32:40.476 --> 32:42.376
Stone cold guilty. Murderer.

32:42.443 --> 32:44.209
Should have torn her to shreds.

32:44.276 --> 32:46.042
MADELEINE:
The maid
let us in.

32:46.109 --> 32:47.409
Start looking for a new maid.

32:47.476 --> 32:48.769
Okay, guys, how
do you want to do this ?

32:48.769 --> 32:51.910
Take turns calling me
a hypocrite ? What ?
Saying, oh, yeah,

32:51.910 --> 32:53.533
trial is war,
and I'm a deserter.

32:53.533 --> 32:55.423
I got it all. Come on.
Take your best shot.

32:56.876 --> 32:58.009
Come on, let's go.

32:58.076 --> 33:00.259
 <i>State of Ohio v. Pavey.</i>

33:00.259 --> 33:02.626
The same equipment used
by Anita's serology expert

33:02.626 --> 33:03.753
yielded
faulty results.

33:03.753 --> 33:04.957
Grounds for a 
successful appeal.

33:04.957 --> 33:05.960
Casts doubt on
Anita's theory.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.957
Jenny attended a program
for gifted students

33:07.967 --> 33:09.542
her senior year of high school.

33:09.609 --> 33:12.009
Guy who runs it says she's
a narcissist and a liar.

33:12.076 --> 33:14.043
He's happy to testify
to it in court.

33:14.109 --> 33:15.509
Broke down the timeline.

33:15.575 --> 33:17.176
There's a discrepancy 
between Jenny's account

33:17.243 --> 33:18.442
and the room service log.

33:18.509 --> 33:19.431
Sabado's
off the cheese fries,

33:19.431 --> 33:21.354
but he's on a mean
cupcake bender.

33:21.354 --> 33:22.853
Juror number six is born again.

33:22.920 --> 33:24.421
Thinks rock 'n' roll
is the devil's music.

33:24.487 --> 33:26.753
And the promiscuity angle should
help us with three and ten.

33:28.521 --> 33:30.387
You worked your tails off,
and I let you down.

33:31.586 --> 33:32.953
So what's
the next move ?

33:33.020 --> 33:36.020
Honestly ? I don't have one.

33:36.087 --> 33:37.720
Make one up.
Truth is relative.

33:37.787 --> 33:39.320
Yada, yada. Let's go.

33:39.387 --> 33:41.187
You blew it, but you're
still the only shot

33:41.254 --> 33:42.421
we have to win this case.

33:42.487 --> 33:44.287
And that is why
we're here. Remember ?

33:44.354 --> 33:45.487
See that ?

33:47.254 --> 33:50.054
She made that when she was 15.

33:52.054 --> 33:53.553
Imagine how her friends
laughed at her

33:53.620 --> 33:55.920
when she said, "Oh, I'm going
to be a big star."

33:55.987 --> 33:58.120
But, hey, look at her now.

33:58.187 --> 33:59.853
Yeah. She's on trial for murder.

33:59.920 --> 34:02.853
The point is,
she knew what she wanted.

34:02.920 --> 34:05.586
She was driven
by pure ambition.

34:05.653 --> 34:07.753
Nothing else mattered.

34:07.820 --> 34:10.664
You know, all my life,
all I ever wanted to be

34:10.664 --> 34:13.054
was the best lawyer
in the world.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.853
But when you lose that drive--

34:14.920 --> 34:18.719
that consuming ambition--

34:19.208 --> 34:19.967
you're done.

34:22.774 --> 34:24.382
Mine died with Deena Brock.

34:24.652 --> 34:26.853
You're still the best.
If that were true,

34:26.920 --> 34:28.553
I would have let you
rip Jenny's heart out.

34:28.620 --> 34:30.353
To be the best,
you got to be like her.

34:30.420 --> 34:32.219
Be in complete control.

34:32.286 --> 34:33.719
Never leave anything to chance.

34:33.786 --> 34:36.786
Never let yourself
be vulnerable.

34:42.737 --> 34:44.177
Obsessive control.

34:44.177 --> 34:46.820
Never let yourself

34:46.887 --> 34:50.054
be the victim.

34:50.120 --> 34:52.020
Oh, man. Oh, man.

34:52.087 --> 34:55.154
Yes. Yes ! Yes, yes, yes, yes.

34:55.219 --> 34:57.350
I want the original
of that tape 

34:57.354 --> 34:58.720
brought to the LAPD Crime Lab.

34:58.787 --> 35:00.020
I want it back
in two hours.

35:00.087 --> 35:01.553
In the bullpen,
30 minutes !

35:01.620 --> 35:03.220
Yes !

35:05.620 --> 35:08.953
I am great, and yet...

35:09.020 --> 35:10.620
I am humble.

35:10.686 --> 35:13.220
The Prosecution now wishes
to cross-examine the witness ?

35:13.287 --> 35:15.054
Yes, Your Honor.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.487
What now ?

35:16.553 --> 35:18.020
Watch and learn.

35:18.087 --> 35:19.487
Thank you.

35:19.553 --> 35:21.020
Ms. Dennison,

35:21.087 --> 35:23.254
when did you first decide
you wanted to be a pop star ?

35:23.320 --> 35:26.133
I guess it was the first time
I saw a Madonna video.

35:26.133 --> 35:27.586
I was seven.

35:27.653 --> 35:30.187
Besides Madonna, what other
performers do you emulate ?

35:30.254 --> 35:32.881
J.Lo ? Britney Spears ?
Christina Aguilera ?

35:32.881 --> 35:33.753
Definitely.

35:33.820 --> 35:35.341
Now, those singers incorporate

35:35.341 --> 35:37.720
an explicit sexuality
into their performances,

35:37.720 --> 35:40.120
but according to publicity
material from Defiance Records,

35:40.187 --> 35:41.720
your label,

35:41.787 --> 35:44.087
you are the next Norah Jones--

35:44.154 --> 35:46.120
wholesome, spiritual
and family-friendly.

35:46.187 --> 35:47.720
Doesn't that bother you ?

35:47.787 --> 35:50.553
Defiance signed me. They decide
the best way to sell my music.

35:50.620 --> 35:52.120
But you've been
planning your career 

35:52.187 --> 35:54.653
since you were in grade school,
and you know that sex sells.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.220
You're smart enough
to know that.

35:56.287 --> 35:57.820
So why do you think
they didn't listen to you ?

35:57.887 --> 36:00.787
Objection. What is the relevance
of this line of inquiry ?

36:00.853 --> 36:03.087
JUDGE:
Mr. Stark ?
Ms. Dennison...

36:03.154 --> 36:05.120
this is a video
you made four years ago

36:05.187 --> 36:07.054
on an SD200 camcorder.

36:07.120 --> 36:10.220
It is Defense Exhibit D,
previously entered.

36:10.287 --> 36:12.320
A forensic analysis confirms
that this tape

36:12.387 --> 36:14.920
bears the precise
electromagnetic artifacts

36:14.987 --> 36:17.620
as the videotape of you
and Terrence Rourke

36:17.686 --> 36:19.287
at the Chateau Hotel.

36:19.354 --> 36:21.953
In other words,
these two tapes were made

36:22.020 --> 36:24.320
by the exact same camera, Jenny.

36:24.387 --> 36:25.853
 <i>Your</i> camera.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.770
Would you please explain
to this jury why you lied

36:27.790 --> 36:30.120
about whose
camera was used
to make the tape ?

36:30.187 --> 36:32.820
I didn't lie. I... I guess
Terry used my camera.

36:32.830 --> 36:34.154
That's not what you said.

36:34.220 --> 36:36.020
You said,
"He showed me his camera.

36:36.087 --> 36:37.553
He must have brought it
with him."

36:37.620 --> 36:38.887
Your testimony is on record.

36:38.953 --> 36:40.154
Shall I have it read back ?

36:40.220 --> 36:41.320
A brief recess,
Your Honor ?

36:41.387 --> 36:42.720
Denied.

36:42.787 --> 36:44.753
Ms. Dennison, would
you please tell this jury

36:44.820 --> 36:47.388
why you videotaped yourself
and Terrence Rourke

36:47.388 --> 36:49.920
having sex at the Chateau Hotel ?

36:49.987 --> 36:53.423
It was all
a big misunderstanding.

36:53.423 --> 36:54.153
Did you tell Terrence

36:54.153 --> 36:55.686
you were videotaping
your sexual encounter ?

36:55.753 --> 36:56.787
No, but...
Why not ?

36:56.853 --> 36:58.254
I didn't think he'd care.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.487
But he did care, did he not ?
In fact, he was horrified

37:00.553 --> 37:02.154
by what you did.
What happened

37:02.220 --> 37:04.686
when Terrence Rourke realized
what you were up to ?

37:04.753 --> 37:08.087
When Terry spotted the camera,
he got really mad.

37:08.154 --> 37:10.553
He was scared
his mom would see the tape.

37:10.620 --> 37:12.403
STARK:
Because you intended
to make the tape public.

37:12.470 --> 37:13.668
I didn't say that !

37:13.668 --> 37:15.120
Is it humanly possible

37:15.187 --> 37:16.887
that you could
have released this tape

37:16.953 --> 37:19.313
to cause a scandal
that would launch your career ?

37:19.313 --> 37:20.521
No.
You didn't
give the tape

37:20.586 --> 37:21.514
to the police.

37:21.514 --> 37:23.154
You took your bloody
little fingers,

37:23.220 --> 37:24.820
walked down the hall,
and slipped it to your manager.

37:24.887 --> 37:28.586
And now it somehow magically--
miracle of miracles--

37:28.653 --> 37:30.521
finds its way onto the Internet.

37:30.586 --> 37:33.553
Now everybody's
talking about it--
talking about you--

37:33.620 --> 37:36.820
the week your first album
is about to be released.

37:36.887 --> 37:38.320
Can you look this
jury in the eye

37:38.387 --> 37:40.387
and tell any
single one of
them that this is

37:40.454 --> 37:41.653
a cosmic accident ?

37:45.553 --> 37:50.787
Now, would you
kindly tell this jury

37:50.853 --> 37:53.254
what happened
in that hotel room

37:53.320 --> 37:55.154
between you

37:55.220 --> 37:56.753
and Terrence Rourke ?

37:56.820 --> 38:02.454
Terry tried to grab the tape.

38:02.521 --> 38:04.318
He wrestled me
onto the bed,

38:04.318 --> 38:07.586
his knee was on my chest.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.553
I should have just
given it to him.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.787
STARK:
Why didn't you ?

38:10.853 --> 38:12.787
I don't know.

38:12.853 --> 38:15.387
I couldn't breathe.

38:15.454 --> 38:18.553
I got scared.
I was still kind of drunk.

38:18.620 --> 38:19.953
When I grabbed the knife,

38:20.020 --> 38:23.020
I just wanted to scare him,
to make him stop.

38:23.087 --> 38:25.254
I don't know
how this all happened.

38:25.320 --> 38:28.287
STARK:
Jenny, you do,
because the moment

38:28.354 --> 38:29.620
you met Terrence Rourke,

38:29.686 --> 38:32.487
you decided to videotape
your sexual encounter.

38:32.553 --> 38:35.586
That part was premeditated,
was it not ?

38:35.653 --> 38:39.553
Yes, but I swear to God,
I never meant to hurt him.

38:39.620 --> 38:40.887
Please believe me.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.887
I do.

38:45.953 --> 38:50.820
But your plan
cost him his life.

38:50.887 --> 38:54.120
It cost Elizabeth Rourke

38:54.187 --> 38:56.254
her only child.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.720
There is
no greater loss.

39:00.020 --> 39:02.953
No further questions,
Your Honor.

39:05.686 --> 39:08.787
Hi.
Let me get a photo
with the man of the hour.

39:08.853 --> 39:09.595
Your Honor.

39:09.595 --> 39:11.920
 Madam District Attorney,
 <i>por favor.</i>

39:16.987 --> 39:18.087
Beginner's
luck.

39:18.154 --> 39:19.454
It's called winning.
One more ?

39:19.521 --> 39:21.354
Don't worry--
you'll get used to it.

39:21.421 --> 39:22.987
That's good.
Thank you,
Your Honor.

39:23.054 --> 39:23.891
Thanks, Manny.

39:23.891 --> 39:28.387
I am going to
give you exactly 30
seconds to gloat.

39:29.365 --> 39:32.386
Hey, you-you do
know you just won
a huge case, right ?

39:32.386 --> 39:32.878
Yeah.

39:32.878 --> 39:34.295
You look like you just
lost your best friend.

39:34.295 --> 39:38.287
I'm about to lose a hell
of a lot more than that.

39:38.354 --> 39:40.553
As stipulated in your
parents' divorce decree,

39:40.620 --> 39:42.067
having reached
the age of 16,

39:42.087 --> 39:43.379
you must now
designate

39:43.379 --> 39:45.187
which parent will
act as custodian

39:45.254 --> 39:46.720
until your
18th birthday.

39:46.787 --> 39:48.320
Have you reached
a decision ?

39:53.220 --> 39:55.487
Yes.

39:55.553 --> 39:57.920
My mother's been everything
to me.

39:57.987 --> 40:00.920
My protector, my best friend.

40:00.987 --> 40:03.087
When my parents got a divorce,

40:03.154 --> 40:05.586
I thought the world was coming
to an end.

40:05.653 --> 40:08.020
But she made sure it didn't.

40:08.087 --> 40:09.653
I mean, she was a mess,

40:09.720 --> 40:12.454
but she pretended
like everything was okay

40:12.521 --> 40:15.853
so that I wouldn't be scared.

40:15.920 --> 40:19.920
And it wasn't always easy.

40:19.987 --> 40:22.487
I can be a real pain.

40:22.553 --> 40:27.020
But my mom taught me
that it's not enough

40:27.087 --> 40:28.787
to love someone when it's easy.

40:28.853 --> 40:31.653
You got to love
them when it's hard.

40:31.720 --> 40:35.686
When they don't deserve it,
when they're in trouble.

40:35.753 --> 40:39.421
That's what family does.

40:43.354 --> 40:46.087
Which is why I choose
to live with my dad.

40:53.255 --> 40:54.210
 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

40:54.220 --> 40:56.320
I'm as surprised
as you are, probably more.

40:57.686 --> 40:59.713
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

40:59.713 --> 41:00.887
Oh, I'm not hurt.

41:01.028 --> 41:04.262
Well, okay,
I'm a little hurt,

41:04.272 --> 41:05.748
but mostly
I'm scared.

41:05.748 --> 41:07.248
I mean, no offense,
Sebastian,

41:07.314 --> 41:10.312
but you are incredibly
self-absorbed.

41:10.312 --> 41:11.157
No offense taken.

41:11.057 --> 41:12.988
Well, seriously, do you have
any idea what it takes

41:12.988 --> 41:14.855
to raise a teenage girl
alone in Los Angeles ?

41:14.921 --> 41:17.167
No, but if this is
what Julie wants, I...

41:17.177 --> 41:19.222
What she wants !
She's 16 !

41:19.287 --> 41:22.032
She wants a Porsche,
a date with Prince William,

41:22.032 --> 41:23.017
and world peace.

41:23.017 --> 41:24.119
Uh, Mom...
She's a child.

41:24.119 --> 41:28.122
My whole
life is here.

41:28.481 --> 41:29.355
Oh, Jules.

41:32.287 --> 41:34.390
If this is really
what you want...

41:34.390 --> 41:38.354
...I can't stop you.

41:38.421 --> 41:41.788
I just hope to God
you know what you're doing.

41:43.155 --> 41:46.421
This is the biggest case
you'll ever get.

41:48.122 --> 41:50.287
Don't blow it.

42:04.387 --> 42:06.654
Why ?

42:06.721 --> 42:10.122
You're the only father
I'm ever going to have,

42:10.188 --> 42:12.421
and, if there is a God,

42:12.488 --> 42:15.088
I'm the only kid
you're ever going to have.

42:15.155 --> 42:19.721
Mom's really mad right now,
but she'll get over it.

42:19.788 --> 42:22.188
If I go to New York,

42:22.254 --> 42:26.671
you and I will exchange
birthday cards

42:26.671 --> 42:27.993
and Christmas presents,

42:27.993 --> 42:32.821
but we'll wind up
perfect strangers.

42:32.888 --> 42:35.472
You may prefer that,
but I don't.

42:35.472 --> 42:36.678
The last thing
I would ever want...

42:36.678 --> 42:39.554
For once, don't say anything.

42:39.621 --> 42:41.721
I've gone to the shrink
long enough to know

42:41.788 --> 42:43.521
that I'll be screwed up for life

42:43.588 --> 42:46.188
if I don't get some closure
on you and me.

42:46.254 --> 42:50.588
And there's another reason
why I chose you.

42:50.654 --> 42:53.721
Something you probably
don't understand,

42:53.788 --> 42:56.321
and maybe you never will.

42:57.988 --> 43:00.188
You need me.
