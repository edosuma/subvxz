WEBVTT

00:02.730 --> 00:05.440
- you're gonna buy all my interest in ojai foods.
- We can't

00:05.540 --> 00:09.230
holly and I are gonna take the 
proceeds from the sale of the stock
and buy greendale winery.

00:09.330 --> 00:10.570
I'm not supposed to have sex yet.

00:10.670 --> 00:14.560
They think I'll just replace my drug addiction-
-oh,and what,after rehab you're sworn to celibacy?

00:14.660 --> 00:15.650
Yeah,kinda.

00:15.660 --> 00:16.390
I gotta go.

00:16.410 --> 00:18.930
You're looking for something.
I'm not enough for you.

00:19.240 --> 00:20.400
Am I enough for you?

00:20.586 --> 00:23.320
-Are you running for president?
-Well, yes,I am, miss walker.

00:24.004 --> 00:25.931
Dad had another kid, with holly.

00:26.120 --> 00:29.725
-Does mom know about this?
-No. And, kevin, she never will.

00:29.827 --> 00:33.149
-You told your sister about us?
-Just that we're friends. It's--it's fine.

00:33.249 --> 00:34.773
Don't worry. We gotta be careful.

00:35.085 --> 00:36.933
The prodigal daughter returns.

00:37.155 --> 00:39.901
-I thought it would be a nice surprise.
-Oh,my god.

00:58.267 --> 00:59.450
hey.

00:59.865 --> 01:02.012
Do you know what this-
-the editorial is about?

01:02.938 --> 01:06.171
That one of the reasons that governor
whitmore's candidacy is a stretch is

01:06.396 --> 01:08.300
because his daughter is too fat
to be first daughter.

01:08.508 --> 01:09.341
She's 13.

01:09.566 --> 01:11.470
You're right.
That's awful.

01:11.846 --> 01:16.471
Yeah.
I mean,my children are going through a divorce.

01:16.846 --> 01:17.823
They need time.

01:18.318 --> 01:21.892
They don't need to be judged by
the national media or anyone.

01:23.017 --> 01:27.140
-And not to mention...
-no.No,no.No way.

01:29.206 --> 01:31.402
I'm not gonna be a factor in that decision.

01:32.427 --> 01:36.473
Well,you know that there's no way
for us to have a normal relationship.

01:36.708 --> 01:38.670
You can forget about it,right?

01:40.158 --> 01:41.110
Okay.

01:42.138 --> 01:45.010
There is a personal cost when
you run for president.

01:45.118 --> 01:49.923
But as far as we're concerned,there's
no reason why you and I can't
be a normal couple.

01:51.566 --> 01:52.762
How?

01:53.205 --> 01:58.153
Well, uh, for starters, we could
try and sleep in a little bit.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.790
is that what normal couples do?

02:02.858 --> 02:05.552
What about this?

02:06.325 --> 02:08.472
Uh,yeah.

02:08.925 --> 02:10.440
Yeah,that's normal.

02:16.417 --> 02:19.360
-that cannot be a good thing.
-No,no. It's--it's gearing up.

02:19.645 --> 02:20.770
Just give it a few minutes.

02:21.018 --> 02:22.391
Come on,holly.

02:22.958 --> 02:25.081
Listen to that. It sounds
like it's in its final death throes.

02:25.418 --> 02:27.761
No! No,that's impossible.
It's brand-new.

02:29.665 --> 02:32.621
oh.
my condolences.

02:32.875 --> 02:35.332
-Maybe we better read the manual.
-Okay.

02:35.438 --> 02:38.293
-Um, how's your italian?
- very good.

02:38.308 --> 02:39.250
L.A sucks.

02:39.265 --> 02:42.972
I spent one hour on the 110,
and I missed breakfast with...

02:43.317 --> 02:44.603
caitlin.

02:44.917 --> 02:47.902
Sorry. I didn't realize you had a guest.
No,it's fine.

02:48.445 --> 02:52.803
Saul,this is my daughter rebecca.
Saul and i work together at ojai.

02:53.127 --> 02:57.600
Yeah, it's so nice to meet you, rebecca.
Your mother never said that you were so lovely.

02:58.937 --> 03:02.700
Oh,I guess mom doesn't talk about me much,
'cause I doubt she'd use the word "lovely.

03:02.858 --> 03:06.271
Becca,that was a compliment.
Say thank you.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.213
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

03:09.528 --> 03:12.860
-is there any cereal left?
-Uh,yeah. Try the top shelf.

03:14.046 --> 03:16.561
Well,I didn't realize it
was getting to be so late.

03:17.255 --> 03:20.403
It was very nice to meet you, rebecca. Bye.

03:21.156 --> 03:23.140
we'll talk more at the office.

03:30.326 --> 03:33.270
Soy about,um...interrupting
the midmorning booty call.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.552
Maybe you should put a sock on
the door or something.

03:35.735 --> 03:38.593
Saul was just helping me
with the coffee machine.

03:38.778 --> 03:41.513
Oh,is that what the senior set is
calling it these days?

03:41.757 --> 03:45.882
Yes,we are seeing each other,
if that's what you mean.

03:46.106 --> 03:49.222
Well,at least that embarrassing
little run-inclarified some things...

03:49.558 --> 03:53.850
the sudden windfall, the winery,
the maserati, the crazy-expensive housewares.

03:54.065 --> 03:56.621
-Saul has nothing to do with any of that.
-Right.

03:56.728 --> 04:00.881
Becca, I told you the truth.
A close friend died and left me some money.

04:01.276 --> 04:04.261
This is a good thing, becca.

04:04.455 --> 04:09.851
I mean,you can go back to college if you want.
You can take classes--writing, photography.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.242
You can travel if you want.

04:12.965 --> 04:15.413
The point is, we have options.

04:16.278 --> 04:18.370
Why can't you be happy?

04:18.935 --> 04:21.112
I would be happy if we had coffee.

04:23.315 --> 04:24.371
okay.

04:25.125 --> 04:28.682
No,we swore for the sake of our
sisterhood that we would never,ever,ever

04:28.788 --> 04:30.801
ask each otherto double-date again ever.

04:31.006 --> 04:34.610
Oh,come on, sarah. We were 19 years old.
That is ancient history, and...

04:35.378 --> 04:38.341
besides, I already told robert
that you would come.

04:38.576 --> 04:40.292
Oh, it's "robert" now?

04:40.518 --> 04:44.142
Well,I have seen the birthmark on his butt,
so we're on a first-name basis.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.663
Would you just come on? It'll be fun.

04:46.527 --> 04:49.222
one thing joe and i are
not at the moment is fun.

04:49.478 --> 04:51.073
I'd say we're downright gloomy.

04:51.285 --> 04:53.251
Well, shake it up. Get out.

04:53.585 --> 04:57.343
Yeah, right ,um...intensive couples
counseling didn't work,

04:57.447 --> 04:59.521
but a good dinner out,that'll fix everything.

04:59.888 --> 05:02.473
Look, sarah, I know that you and joe
have been having a hard time,

05:02.575 --> 05:06.063
but if I honestly believed that staying home
was gonna help,then I would just drop it.

05:06.298 --> 05:08.270
-Sarah, there's a problem.
-Okay,

05:08.608 --> 05:10.920
listen,fine. But if it's a complete disaster,
don't say I didn't tell you.

05:12.495 --> 05:13.971
What's the problem?

05:16.418 --> 05:17.613
It's your sister.

05:18.135 --> 05:19.643
I just got off the phone with her.

05:20.185 --> 05:21.453
Not kitty.

05:25.416 --> 05:26.820
Arah what do you mean you knew?

05:26.927 --> 05:29.331
What?
I ran into her at holly's house the other day.

05:29.598 --> 05:31.102
And you didn't think that was worth mentioning?

05:31.307 --> 05:33.333
I didn't think any of you wanted to hear it.
No.

05:33.686 --> 05:34.661
Well,you're right about that.

05:34.866 --> 05:36.423
Well,what was she like?

05:37.518 --> 05:40.351
I don't know.
She...she seemed fine.

05:40.868 --> 05:42.992
Well, how long is she staying?
I mean, if this is just a visit, I'd say we drop it.

05:43.347 --> 05:47.923
It's not just a visit. Apparently, she's dropped out
of college and was living with a friend in chicago.

05:48.668 --> 05:51.881
And when that didn't work out,
she moved back home indefinitely.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.033
Sounds like holly raised a real winner.

05:54.218 --> 05:59.362
Despite your opinion of holly or rebecca,
the question remains, what are we going to do?

06:01.818 --> 06:02.773
Nothing.

06:02.966 --> 06:05.493
Absolutely nothing.
Not with everything that's been going on here.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.520
And what's that supposed to mean?

06:07.698 --> 06:10.850
What I mean, tommy, is do you really
think this business with holly can go on

06:11.048 --> 06:12.740
if mom finds out about rebecca?

06:12.985 --> 06:15.511
Ugh, this is exactly
why I didn't want to say anything.

06:15.615 --> 06:18.953
Excuse me,holly is in our lives now.
She is working here. What if nora runs into rebecca?

06:19.487 --> 06:21.641
What if your mother asks questions?

06:23.018 --> 06:24.241
I say we tell her.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.591
I can't believe I'm hearing this from you,saul.

06:26.797 --> 06:28.532
Mom finding out now will destroy her.

06:28.706 --> 06:33.252
Besides,you're in a relationship with holly. How long do
you think that can last if this whole thing blows up?

06:33.655 --> 06:35.662
We all have things at stake,sarah.

06:36.007 --> 06:38.353
At least if it's out in the open we
have a chance to diffuse it.

06:38.545 --> 06:42.732
Saul,rebecca's lived in this city most of her life.
It hasn't affected any of us.

06:43.928 --> 06:45.760
Justin and kitty don't even know she exists.

06:45.865 --> 06:48.091
That's another thing.
I mean, justin's just out of rehab.

06:48.385 --> 06:51.230
-Are we really gonna throw this at him?
-Right.

06:52.087 --> 06:54.860
If your mother found out that we
were keeping this from her--

06:54.966 --> 06:56.802
we've been keeping it from her for--for months.

06:56.907 --> 06:58.840
That was beforerebecca moved back home.

06:59.036 --> 07:01.141
Our chances of keeping this
a secret from her are--

07:01.248 --> 07:03.932
saul,nobody will find
out if we don't tell them.

07:04.607 --> 07:07.762
Now holly's lied to rebecca her whole life.

07:08.197 --> 07:10.523
I don't think she's gonna risk telling her now.

07:12.885 --> 07:14.231
Come on.

07:15.125 --> 07:17.582
Haven't we learned anything this year?

07:22.665 --> 07:24.493
Tommy,you're with us,right?

07:24.746 --> 07:26.170
-Yeah.
-Good.

07:28.528 --> 07:30.731
Apparently,you've all made up your minds.

07:31.298 --> 07:33.152
It's settled then.

07:35.686 --> 07:39.331
Brothers and Sisters
Season 01 Episode 16

07:39.798 --> 07:42.921
He had this one long hair.
His, like, fu manchu thing.

07:43.277 --> 07:45.761
and he had this little fuzzon his upper lip.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.650
-He was so proud of him
-you're kidding.

07:47.885 --> 07:49.460
-And he called it a mustache?
-Yeah.

07:49.974 --> 07:51.591
It was a mustache.

07:51.760 --> 07:52.825
It was a mustache.

07:53.058 --> 07:54.789
Mom,is there anything else you wanna bring up?

07:54.889 --> 07:58.531
How about my acneor that--
that piano tie I wore to the senior prom?

07:58.738 --> 08:00.012
Oh,my god.

08:00.235 --> 08:02.881
You were the guy in the piano tie.

08:03.788 --> 08:06.440
I can't believe this is happening.
Mom, you're killing me.

08:06.748 --> 08:10.190
Oh,don't be ridiculous.
I--I'm gonna make you a bagel.

08:10.495 --> 08:13.642
If it'll stop the humiliating trip
down memory lane, please.

08:15.857 --> 08:18.523
look,I thought we were being discreet.
You're not dressed.

08:18.696 --> 08:19.643
I'm not naked.

08:19.748 --> 08:21.362
What are you two whispering
about down there?

08:22.606 --> 08:25.332
I was just offering, uh,tyler a
ride to work today.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.203
Justin, come on, now.

08:26.408 --> 08:27.962
You don't need to feel uncomfortable. Really,tyler is
welcome to stay over any time she likes.

08:28.176 --> 08:30.361
I mean,you two are old enough to do
whatever you want.

08:30.558 --> 08:33.082
-Just stay safe.
-We are.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.412
-All right,just--here you go. Eat up.
-Thank you.

08:35.706 --> 08:37.033
I'm going...

08:37.357 --> 08:38.030
please.

08:38.135 --> 08:40.712
-going get ready for my day. Bye.
-Bye.

08:41.885 --> 08:46.330
Wow,you must've really won her over. I mean, she does
not dig up those embarrassing stories for just anyone.

08:46.556 --> 08:47.650
Well, you can get even tonight.

08:47.755 --> 08:51.931
My parents will be more than happy to fill you
in on all the gory details of my adolescence.

08:52.035 --> 08:54.821
Okay,they're meeting their only daughter's
recovering-addict boyfriend.

08:55.006 --> 08:58.102
Somehow senior prom doesn't strike me as
the dinner topic of choice.

08:58.208 --> 09:00.171
Justin, they're not like that.

09:00.408 --> 09:02.883
-They're gonna love you.
-I hope so.

09:05.628 --> 09:06.772
check out this web site.

09:06.875 --> 09:08.200

-Yep.

Everything you always wanted and not
wanted to know about your celebrities.

Scroll down past the photo of britney
without underwear.

09:19.405 --> 09:20.813
oh,it's you...

09:21.186 --> 09:22.442

-Wow, I'm a friend?
-You're a friend in italics.

"And if that didn't sound the alarm,check out
the less-than-hetero lamp he took home."

09:33.575 --> 09:36.210
I told you that lamp was gay and ugly.

09:36.416 --> 09:37.571
It gets worse.

09:37.675 --> 09:42.562
"It could just bewishful thinking, but we're getting a
serious gayvibe from the daytime doctor.

09:42.757 --> 09:46.851
"Kev, I've spent the morning fielding calls from
my agent, my manager, my mom.

09:46.955 --> 09:48.623
Your mom checks skinny minnie?

09:48.808 --> 09:51.153
She googles my name once a week.

09:52.056 --> 09:54.000
And that's not the point.

09:54.696 --> 09:55.901
We need to lay low.

09:56.008 --> 09:58.810
What?
Chad, we barely go out in daylight as it is.

09:59.078 --> 10:01.341
Come on, I'm starting to feel like a vampire.

10:01.526 --> 10:03.290
Besides, we didn't do anything wrong.

10:03.485 --> 10:06.232
I know. But, kev, I'm in this guy's sights.

10:06.525 --> 10:09.943
Look,there are better options than laying low.
Believe me. We can call...

10:10.925 --> 10:12.631
dan silk, threaten him.

10:12.868 --> 10:15.143
No offense, but I don't think you could take him.

10:15.416 --> 10:18.812
Not to mention pummeling this guy
wouldn't do much for my public image.

10:18.976 --> 10:21.523
I mean,we could threaten him with legal action.

10:21.798 --> 10:22.673
But it's true.

10:22.775 --> 10:25.480
I'm a lawyer. Truth is irrelevant.
Look, I do this all the time.

10:25.598 --> 10:27.810
I just need to make it clear,
if he doesn't print a retraction,

10:27.916 --> 10:30.662
he's gonna face a very lengthy,
very expensive lawsuit.

10:30.886 --> 10:34.151
I'll bury him in discovery and depositions.
It's lawyering 101.

10:34.225 --> 10:36.160
I've never seen you so...

10:36.366 --> 10:38.422
-litigious.
-Right.

10:39.405 --> 10:40.961
It's kinda hot.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.542
but no way can you call him.

10:44.648 --> 10:46.672
Oh,why--look, he's not some major corporation.

10:46.807 --> 10:48.590
He's one guy. He's one loser.
He'll cave. They all do.

10:49.625 --> 10:50.921
-Believe me.
-No.

10:51.436 --> 10:53.720
We just need to let it blow over.

10:53.937 --> 10:55.531
these stories don't have a long shelf life.

10:55.635 --> 10:59.762
If we don't give him any more ammunition,
this silk dude will move on to somebody else.

11:00.717 --> 11:02.900
A-nd then- -and then what, daylight again?

11:03.127 --> 11:05.450
-Definitely.
-Good.

11:05.895 --> 11:07.830
And I could totally take that guy.

11:09.866 --> 11:12.183
You just worry too much, nora.
You always have.

11:12.388 --> 11:14.753
Look,I know sarah and joe are
going through a rough time,

11:14.858 --> 11:16.812
but are you sure that's all?

11:17.028 --> 11:22.952
I really think tommy's decision to buy this winery
with holly is bothering her more than she's letting on.

11:23.136 --> 11:25.492
Look,tommy and sarah have a very strong bond.

11:26.318 --> 11:31.472
And william never would have brought sarah to
ojai foods if he thought that she and tommy
couldn't survive a little sibling rivalry.

11:31.667 --> 11:35.293
You're right. you're right.

11:35.505 --> 11:37.261
-I mean,look at us.
-What do you mean?

11:37.455 --> 11:41.201
Our family wasn't exactly a picnic,and yet,
here we are after all these years,

11:41.306 --> 11:43.092
still speaking to one another.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.770
-You want a green bean?
-Yes,thank you.

11:45.358 --> 11:47.002
-It's a small miracle, isn't it?
-Yes,it is.

11:47.946 --> 11:49.353
I don't know...

11:50.238 --> 11:53.441
I think maybe I was wrong about her.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.471
-About who?
-Holly.

11:54.577 --> 11:55.432
What do you mean?

11:55.656 --> 11:59.080
You're seeing her,
tommy is starting a company with her.

11:59.187 --> 12:01.352
As much as I hate to admit it...

12:02.957 --> 12:05.251
maybe william was a good judge of character.

12:09.088 --> 12:11.752
Well,I mean,your instincts are admirable,

12:11.856 --> 12:14.941
but you don't have to put aside your feelings
for the sake of any of us, nora.

12:15.048 --> 12:18.010
I'm not saying I want to be
the woman's best friend.

12:19.415 --> 12:21.040
I'm just saying...

12:23.127 --> 12:28.643
I have been so busy blaming her, I don't think I've
 ever really seen her for who she is.

12:29.407 --> 12:31.302
Okay. So what are you proposing?

12:31.898 --> 12:35.063
The truth of the matter is,
holly isa part of our family now.

12:36.236 --> 12:39.520
I think I should embrace that,
if only to set an example.

12:39.626 --> 12:43.330
I mean,we all have to put the past behind us
where it belongs and move on.

12:44.147 --> 12:45.483
You think I'm crazy?

12:45.698 --> 12:47.830
No, nora, I don't think you're crazy.

12:48.237 --> 12:54.692
Good,'cause if there's one person I count on to
be my reality check, it's you.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.780
Saul?

13:03.037 --> 13:04.612
What?

13:06.196 --> 13:10.331
It's the past.
It's--it--it's not behind us.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.232
You have to tell me.
What?

13:15.877 --> 13:17.350
Tell me.

13:19.196 --> 13:21.202
William and holly had a daughter.

13:23.506 --> 13:24.280
What?

13:24.458 --> 13:26.962
Her name is rebecca.
She's 20 years old.

13:27.268 --> 13:30.191
She's here in L.A. I'm so sorry, nora.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.333
I'm so sorry.

13:32.977 --> 13:35.273
No one wanted to upset you.

13:35.616 --> 13:37.271
"No one"?

13:37.958 --> 13:39.780
Who else knows?

13:41.377 --> 13:43.451
Who else knows?

13:43.557 --> 13:45.451
Sarah and tommy and kevin.

13:45.557 --> 13:47.520
-But you have to understand-
-what about justin and kitty?

13:47.725 --> 13:49.551
They don't know.

13:49.867 --> 13:52.491
-Oh,god.
-Look,n ora, I didn't want this to be like the affair.

13:52.627 --> 13:55.791
I didn't want it to fester under the surface,
haunting us.

13:55.977 --> 13:57.452
-Come on,nora.
-Oh,my god.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.360
Where--where are you going?
What are you doing?

13:59.796 --> 14:03.070
-I have to find kitty and justin.
-Please,wait. Talk to me. Wait,please.

14:03.248 --> 14:04.773
No.
There will be no more lies,saul.

14:04.876 --> 14:06.431
No more. I won't stand for it.

14:06.808 --> 14:08.111
Nora,wait.

14:11.546 --> 14:12.583
are you sure?

14:12.788 --> 14:14.790
I mean, how do we know that holly's
even telling the truth?

14:14.897 --> 14:18.411
As much as I'd like to,I don't think
we can ignore the obvious.

14:19.996 --> 14:22.542
What are we supposed to say?
"Oh, wow, we have a sister now"?

14:22.858 --> 14:25.763
Justin,you don't have to say or do
anything you don't want to.

14:25.868 --> 14:29.461
This is just going to take time for us all.

14:29.796 --> 14:34.922
So--so what? Dad made holly a beneficiary of 
the land because of rebecca?

14:35.438 --> 14:38.413
I don't know,but I suspect it's part of it.

14:39.245 --> 14:41.503
Did he know that he was her father?

14:41.698 --> 14:43.590
I don't know what he knew.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.320
This is crazy.

14:46.538 --> 14:50.840
You're saying dad hid one of his kids from
us for years,and then gave holly the land,

14:50.945 --> 14:54.591
so--so his affair is thrown in our face
because of some girl named rebecca?

14:54.768 --> 14:57.041
Justin,I wish I could tell you what
your father was thinking.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.813
I--it's a shock.
It's a shock for me,too.

14:59.127 --> 15:00.941
I don't know why.
He lied to you about having a mistress.

15:01.298 --> 15:02.253
Oh, justin, that's not fair.

15:02.356 --> 15:04.770
No,seriously,I mean,why should I be so
shocked that he lied to us,too?

15:04.877 --> 15:07.890
I mean,this whole--this whole family
revolves around lying.

15:08.078 --> 15:09.620
Justin,please.

15:09.725 --> 15:11.400
grandma!Aunt kitty!

15:11.507 --> 15:12.963
-hi,honey. -Hi,grandma.

15:13.187 --> 15:15.211
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:15.545 --> 15:17.111
-hey, guys.
-Hey, sweetie poo.

15:17.438 --> 15:18.620
-Hi,rascal.
-Hey,guys.

15:19.116 --> 15:19.990
Wonderful.

15:20.785 --> 15:21.791
-Hey,nora.
-Hi.

15:22.748 --> 15:23.991
Hey,kitty.

15:24.407 --> 15:25.981
I can hardly pick you up.

15:31.597 --> 15:37.201
Please help me understand how you could discover your
 father has another child and not tell me.

15:37.307 --> 15:39.000
We we trying to spare you the pain.

15:39.107 --> 15:41.621
How,by keeping me in the dark?

15:41.855 --> 15:44.610
God,you should've seen justin's reaction.

15:44.715 --> 15:46.581
Oh,that's why saul
shouldn't have said anything.

15:46.688 --> 15:50.222
No,you do not get to blame saul for this.

15:50.415 --> 15:56.853
At least he had enough faith in me,enough respect for me,
to be honest, which is more than I can say 
for you or tommy or kevin.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.580
What...were you just never gonna tell me?
Is that it?

15:59.885 --> 16:04.062
Mom,you've had so much to cope with.
Just didn't seem to be the right time.

16:04.277 --> 16:09.463
Oh,I can just see tommy spearheading this
whole brilliant idea. He's so like his father.

16:09.575 --> 16:11.833
No,it was my idea.

16:14.686 --> 16:15.931
It was your idea?

16:16.035 --> 16:20.723
Yeah,I was the one who thought that we
should keep this information from you.

16:20.826 --> 16:25.273
your father made you president of our
family business, sarah, not our family.

16:25.376 --> 16:29.502
And you taught me to always put
this family first...and that's what I was trying to do.

16:29.798 --> 16:32.700
No,it is not. You were trying to do what
 was easy for you.

16:32.976 --> 16:35.173
You think this has been easy,
keeping this a secret?

16:35.276 --> 16:37.263
No one asked you to.

16:37.485 --> 16:39.722
There is no justification for this.

16:40.286 --> 16:42.560
oh,god.What?!

16:42.667 --> 16:43.862
Hey.

16:44.075 --> 16:45.002
You ready for dinner?

16:45.168 --> 16:47.391
-May I speak to dan silk?
-You're talking to him.

16:47.838 --> 16:49.423
My name is kevin walker,and F.Y.I.

16:49.525 --> 16:53.593
If you're gonna make a living tarnishing people's 
reputations, you may want an unlisted number.

16:53.695 --> 16:55.003
Thanks for the tip.

16:55.276 --> 16:56.041
Do I know you?

16:56.246 --> 17:00.190
No,you do not, although you did print my picture 
without my permission on your little libelous web site.

17:00.298 --> 17:02.223
I'm the friend of chad barry.

17:02.415 --> 17:04.830
-Oh, you're that dude.
-Yeah, I'm that dude.

17:05.685 --> 17:08.000
Hey,I'm just looking for the
dish on barry,so,uh,

17:08.106 --> 17:09.421
if you wanna spill, I'm sure I could--

17:09.526 --> 17:11.742
no,no,no,no.You misunderstand.
I'm an attorney.

17:12.027 --> 17:12.921
And on behalf of mr.Barry,

17:13.025 --> 17:17.502
I demand that you cease and desist publishing all 
uncorroborated information about his personal life.

17:17.607 --> 17:18.960
Hey,man,what can I say?

17:19.204 --> 17:20.401
Inquiring minds wanna know.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.391
Mr.Barry's contemplating filing a complaint.

17:22.494 --> 17:28.170
The cause of action : invasion of ivacy, libel,
unfair business practices, intentional
infliction of emotional distress.

17:28.276 --> 17:29.202
Should I go on?

17:29.417 --> 17:31.290
But you're not denying barry's gay?

17:33.378 --> 17:36.951
Okay, listen to me, son, and I'll say
this in a way that you understand.

17:37.058 --> 17:40.870
If you don't stop targeting my client,
I will bury you so deep in litigation,

17:40.978 --> 17:44.392
it'll be your great-great-grandchildren
paying off the legal bills.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.832
Do I make myself clear?

17:46.045 --> 17:47.801
Yeah,I get it.

17:48.027 --> 17:51.012
-You made your point.
-Good.Then thank you so much for your time.

17:56.117 --> 17:57.240
hey,mom.

18:00.095 --> 18:01.471
What's wrong?

18:04.658 --> 18:05.811
Kevin?
What are you doing

18:06.218 --> 18:09.700
please,please, tell me exactly
what you were thinking.

18:09.806 --> 18:13.642
Because I'm sure,I'm quite sure,
we all agreedwe would not say a thing.

18:13.838 --> 18:17.311
-You agreed, saul!
-Kevin, kevin, I didn't want it to happen the way it did.

18:17.547 --> 18:20.053
I'm sorry,do you even--do you even
get what you've done?

18:20.157 --> 18:22.892
Mom--mom is furious.

18:23.106 --> 18:28.072
Kitty and justin are reeling.
I mean, sarah is mortified, as am I, as is tommy.

18:28.665 --> 18:32.232
Did you stop and think for a split second
how bad this makes us look?

18:32.435 --> 18:35.453
-Well, frankly, I wasn't thinking about you.
-You weren't thinking of anyone,saul!

18:35.785 --> 18:37.713
I was thinking about your mother.

18:37.926 --> 18:41.181
You had no right, absolutely no right,
to do this without consulting us.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.762
I have every right.

18:43.496 --> 18:45.593
She's my sister.

18:46.098 --> 18:49.073
And you tell me that you wouldn't
do the same thing if it were kitty or sarah.

18:49.318 --> 18:52.293
I wouldn't single-handedly sell
out the rest of my family,no.

18:52.488 --> 18:53.931
You weren't there,kevin.

18:54.378 --> 18:57.310
She was sitting in front of me,
opening up her heart to holly,

18:57.416 --> 19:02.373
berating herself for misjudging her,and she
expected me to tell her that she was doing the right thing.

19:03.506 --> 19:07.063
And I will be damned if I will let her
make herself vulnerable in that way

19:07.165 --> 19:10.372
only to have her world come
crashing down again.

19:12.015 --> 19:14.701
You better hope this family
finds a way to repair itself,

19:14.806 --> 19:20.193
because if this does any lasting damage,
I'm holding you responsible.

19:35.855 --> 19:38.341
you know, I learned something
interesting today.

19:38.615 --> 19:42.732
You know the san francisco cable cars are the
only moving national monument.

19:42.837 --> 19:43.871
didn't know that.

19:44.087 --> 19:46.861
You know, I have told you every time
that I sleep with somebody I work with,

19:46.968 --> 19:48.161
and you can't tell me that we have a sister?

19:48.266 --> 19:51.870
A half-sister, and for the 400th time,
kitty, I am sorry.

19:51.975 --> 19:53.310
I don't know what else to say.

19:53.415 --> 19:55.481
Well--I thought you girls were
gonna table this discussion.

19:55.585 --> 19:56.983
-Yeah, so did I!
-We are.

19:57.718 --> 19:58.941
what's happening in D.C.?

19:59.156 --> 20:01.473
Well, I'm working on legislation now that, if we pass it,

20:01.695 --> 20:04.082
would dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

20:04.287 --> 20:07.101
It'd be like taking 100 million cars right off the street.

20:07.357 --> 20:08.163
It'd be pretty groundbreaking.

20:08.356 --> 20:09.472
-That's impressive.
-Yeah.

20:10.027 --> 20:12.022
-You know,the other thing-
-and for the record...

20:12.035 --> 20:12.691
oh,brother.

20:12.706 --> 20:15.710
I don't see why I should be the one to
take the fall for this. I wasn't the only one that knew.

20:16.117 --> 20:18.441
Okay,well,you're bearing the brunt
of this because you happen to be here.

20:18.546 --> 20:22.301
Okay, believe me,I wish that tommy
and kevin were here,too.

20:22.486 --> 20:23.542
-Is it always like this?
-Yeah.

20:23.906 --> 20:25.642
Anyway,I don't even know why you're upset.
You always dreamed of having a little baby sister.

20:25.947 --> 20:27.850
Sarah,you know what? I was 6, okay?

20:28.135 --> 20:31.162
And that little wish didn't
include dad cheating on mom.

20:31.338 --> 20:36.482
I didn't know what to do, kitty,so I thought
the best thing to do was nothing, so shoot me.

20:36.698 --> 20:38.002
Oh.

20:38.247 --> 20:40.532
do you like cigars?
'Cause I got some good ones, and we could...

20:41.437 --> 20:42.611
that'd be great.

20:42.845 --> 20:43.942
You didn't know what to do,so you did nothing.

20:44.155 --> 20:45.273
Oh, what would you have done, kitty?

20:45.458 --> 20:46.713
-What would you have done? Oh,yeah,just,
I would have told you,sarah.

20:47.355 --> 20:50.233
justin, where are you?
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.

20:50.557 --> 20:51.912
Look, I can't make it.
I'm sorry.

20:52.198 --> 20:54.821
What are you talking about?
My mom's been cooking all day.

20:55.125 --> 20:57.863
Look, I'm sorry, okay. It's something with my family, 
and I can't talk about it now.

20:59.856 --> 21:01.362
Look, I gotta go.
I'll call you tomorrow.

21:05.285 --> 21:06.450
I'm glad you called,man.

21:06.676 --> 21:09.363
-It's been a while. -thanks for coming.

21:10.717 --> 21:12.920
it's bad enough my dad was
in love with another woman,

21:13.026 --> 21:15.512
like my mom wasn't enough, but,
I mean,another kid?

21:15.796 --> 21:17.252
I guess you weren't enough either,huh?

21:17.255 --> 21:19.970
I almost die, and here there I am, back in the same place

21:19.995 --> 21:21.463
like,ready to do it all over again.

21:21.558 --> 21:24.741
Yeah, but you didn't. You didn't use and that's cool man.

21:24.947 --> 21:27.552
- Yeah, but I came close, bro.
 - Course you did.

21:27.656 --> 21:29.670
This whole thing is textbook you.

21:30.165 --> 21:31.910
Look,I know you,justin.

21:32.156 --> 21:35.612
You didn't become an army medic for nothing.
You can't stand to see people in pain.

21:36.166 --> 21:38.410
And right now you
and your family are suffering.

21:38.645 --> 21:41.162
There's nothing you can
do to make that go away.

21:41.377 --> 21:45.893
And if it gets overwhelming,
you know the drill... find a meeting,work the steps.

21:48.556 --> 21:50.560
You know,I still don't get it,though.
I mean, how could he lie to us

21:50.826 --> 21:54.573
about his own daughter like that,knowing
what it would do to us when we found out?

21:54.775 --> 21:56.130
And her.

21:56.428 --> 21:58.243
Rebecca, right?

22:03.957 --> 22:05.982
You know, I didn't even think about her.

22:08.295 --> 22:09.880
God,what if...

22:10.707 --> 22:12.411
I wonder if she even knows.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.910
not exactly a "normal couple" night out,huh?

22:26.456 --> 22:30.540
Oh,I think it was surprisingly normal, considering how
 blindsided you were. You want something to drink?

22:33.708 --> 22:36.323
Oh...yes,please.

22:38.178 --> 22:42.430
I think I have to just sit and not move.

22:44.428 --> 22:48.492
Because if I do,who knows what else is
gonna come along and rip my life apart?

22:48.668 --> 22:50.252
You're right.

22:51.197 --> 22:52.813
Let's not move.

22:54.968 --> 22:56.461
It's too big a risk.

22:56.717 --> 22:58.903
I just don't know what I'm supposed to do.

22:59.385 --> 23:00.882
Why do anything?

23:02.045 --> 23:06.312
Well, eventually, I'm gonna have to get up.

23:06.956 --> 23:10.821
I don't know,the thing is, is that everybody keeps
 telling me that I have this sister, and I don't know 
what the hell that means.

23:11.108 --> 23:16.723
I mean,when I think of sarah,
I don't think of her D.N.A.

23:16.798 --> 23:23.981
I think about how we grew up together in the
same house with the same weird family.

23:24.567 --> 23:27.781
And how we,you know,
shared our diaries and our shampoo.

23:28.006 --> 23:32.182
But what, am I supposed to have those
same feelings for a woman I never even met?

23:32.366 --> 23:34.632
Oh,I don't think anybody expects that.

23:36.487 --> 23:40.541
Oh, well, and there is my dad.

23:41.288 --> 23:44.522
I've been grieving for a father that I don't even know.

23:50.046 --> 23:52.890
And I was just starting to get all...

23:54.085 --> 23:55.432
happy.

24:03.156 --> 24:05.151
I wouldn't let this destroy that.

24:05.916 --> 24:10.692
You hold on to what's good,
what makes you happy.

24:11.697 --> 24:13.731
You make me happy.

24:15.226 --> 24:17.532
-I do?
-Yeah.

24:25.707 --> 24:28.041
would it be okay with you if we...

24:28.536 --> 24:31.971
still just sit here for a while?

24:32.877 --> 24:34.592
As long as you want.

24:58.238 --> 24:59.603
kids wake you up?

24:59.858 --> 25:01.270
No.

25:01.477 --> 25:04.240
I,uh,I just couldn't sleep. you want to talk?

25:08.078 --> 25:12.943
-you want to talk? -No.

25:18.155 --> 25:20.241
it's all right, joe.
You don't have to stay up.

25:28.268 --> 25:30.212
You'll get through this.

25:35.787 --> 25:39.612
Everyone's so mad at me--mom...

25:40.745 --> 25:44.220
kitty, uncle saul.

25:45.495 --> 25:47.252
And,um...

25:48.508 --> 25:50.970
I don't have you.

25:53.137 --> 25:55.012
You know?

25:58.076 --> 26:00.271
I'm right here.

26:22.108 --> 26:23.463
justin.

26:23.986 --> 26:25.441
-Hey,mom.
-Justin.

26:27.275 --> 26:28.031
I'm fine. I'm fine.

26:28.527 --> 26:31.010
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just exhausted.

26:31.045 --> 26:32.172
-Okay.
-Hey.

26:32.736 --> 26:34.361
I told tyler it would be all right
if she waited here.

26:34.498 --> 26:35.783
Okay.Yeah.

26:36.427 --> 26:38.983
I'll give you guys some privacy.
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

26:39.305 --> 26:40.741
-All right. I love you.
-I love you. I'm okay.

26:40.786 --> 26:41.822
-I love you,too.
-I'm okay.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.092
Okay.
Okay.

26:50.167 --> 26:53.092
your mom told me what happened.
I'm sorry.

26:53.496 --> 26:54.951
Sorry about missing dinner.

26:55.055 --> 26:55.992
Oh,it's okay.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.843
I was just worried.
Um,the last time you sounded like that...

26:59.126 --> 27:01.230
I was with my sponsor.

27:01.445 --> 27:04.343
Oh.
That's good.

27:05.108 --> 27:07.860
-Look,I get it if you're angry at me.
-I'm not angry.

27:11.146 --> 27:13.621
I just don't know if I can handle it.

27:15.157 --> 27:18.972
I guess that's why they tell you not to
date anyone your first year you're clean.

27:19.186 --> 27:23.602
I never understood that before tonight,
because I couldn't deal with anyone or anything...

27:24.617 --> 27:26.181
but me.

27:28.106 --> 27:30.223
That's how it should be.

27:31.436 --> 27:33.853
Look,you weren't wrong to worry,okay?

27:40.166 --> 27:43.522
I just don't think
I'm ready for a relationship,tyler.

27:46.115 --> 27:51.032
I know.
I know.

27:51.368 --> 27:54.010
I just want you to be okay.

27:54.585 --> 27:56.863
More than anything I want for us...

27:58.237 --> 28:00.733
I want that for you.

28:01.618 --> 28:02.711
Come here.

28:05.188 --> 28:08.110
it's okay.

28:12.218 --> 28:13.553
have you talked to mom?

28:13.746 --> 28:16.820
I keep trying to reach her,
but she's not picking up,at least not for me.

28:16.926 --> 28:18.721
Yeah,not for me either.

28:19.485 --> 28:23.123
Let me be the one to kick holly
out of our lives once and for all.

28:25.208 --> 28:27.070
s-sarah...

28:27.306 --> 28:30.723
holly's not going anywhere,
nor do I want her to.

28:30.895 --> 28:34.052
I-I hope you don't think
what happened last night changes anything.

28:34.248 --> 28:38.330
It changes everything. Tommy,you can't still be
 planning to go into business with that woman.

28:38.588 --> 28:39.761
I am.

28:40.075 --> 28:44.803
She won't be satisfied until she has destroyed
everything we've created here.

28:45.048 --> 28:47.790
Don't be fooled,tommy.
This whole nightmare is because of her.

28:48.085 --> 28:50.391
Sarah,there is enough blame to go around.

28:50.965 --> 28:52.602
I-is that a dig at me?

28:52.785 --> 28:54.653
We lied, dad lied.

28:54.817 --> 28:57.781
In fact, right now holly's probably the
most honest one of us all.

28:57.968 --> 28:59.570
You can't be that naive.

28:59.675 --> 29:03.322
Look,I already told you,I didn't start
this winery for you or mom.

29:03.445 --> 29:07.451
All right?
I did this for me, building something for myself.

29:07.745 --> 29:10.333
That was before the
horror show landed on my lap.

29:10.508 --> 29:12.791
Look,it landed in our laps.

29:12.986 --> 29:16.980
You want to control everything.
God,you just--you thrive off of control.

29:17.347 --> 29:18.620
But this is out of your hands.

29:18.725 --> 29:19.701
Spare me,tommy.
Okay?

29:20.028 --> 29:24.692
I already pay for therapy. I really don't 
need your amateur psychoanalysis.

29:25.555 --> 29:28.100
just let it go.

29:29.245 --> 29:33.891
okay.Well, clearly I'm the only one
who still gives a damn about ojai,

29:34.097 --> 29:36.812
so...you'll understand that I have work to do.

29:46.426 --> 29:49.340
excuse me. I'm looking for holly harper.
She's not in her office.

29:49.777 --> 29:51.762
I don't know where she...

29:52.855 --> 29:54.523
do I know you?

29:54.765 --> 29:57.182
No,I don't think so.
I'm her daughter rebecca.

30:00.955 --> 30:02.111
Right.

30:03.045 --> 30:05.273
I thought you'd look more like your mom.

30:07.037 --> 30:09.670
I'm sarah...walker.

30:10.035 --> 30:11.980
It's nice to meet you.

30:12.635 --> 30:14.172
You,too.

30:14.388 --> 30:16.132
So...holly?

30:16.195 --> 30:19.801
Oh,um,I have no idea where she is.

30:20.066 --> 30:21.810
Okay.
Thanks.
Sorry.

30:24.108 --> 30:25.643
Rebecca.

30:25.916 --> 30:30.560
Um,do you have a minute?
Could I...talk to you?

30:31.078 --> 30:32.733
Yeah,sure.

30:51.858 --> 30:53.313
Hey,becca.
Where you been?

30:58.306 --> 31:00.051
I stopped by ojai today.

31:00.898 --> 31:03.293
I wanted to check out your new digs.

31:04.296 --> 31:08.573
-You did?
-Yeah, I got the address from
some papers you had lying around.

31:10.005 --> 31:11.751
I thought I'd surprise you.

31:12.467 --> 31:15.593
Well,I'm sorry that I...
I missed you.

31:15.937 --> 31:20.823
I was out meeting with a distributor,and I-I
didn't want to drive all the way back to the office.

31:21.015 --> 31:26.452
So,um,would you like me to
make lunch for both of us?

31:27.138 --> 31:29.852
No.
I don't really have an appetite right now.

31:35.696 --> 31:40.203
I met some people there,at ojai...

31:40.867 --> 31:43.131
like sarah.

31:43.378 --> 31:48.392
Mom,do you remember that christmas
when I was 8 and I had my tonsils taken out?

31:48.566 --> 31:50.990
And then after the surgery,

31:51.095 --> 31:56.622
your friend bill came by to visit,and he
gave me that doll with the long red hair.

31:57.165 --> 32:01.641
Did Bill really think that a doll could make
up for abandoning me?

32:02.628 --> 32:06.003
what was it, like a "sorry for being a
deadbeat dad" gift?

32:06.208 --> 32:08.933
Please...
let me explain.

32:09.337 --> 32:12.401
Oh,there's an explanation for
why you lied to me for 20 years?

32:12.518 --> 32:15.433
You said that bill was just your friend and just kinda left out

32:15.508 --> 32:19.343
that part about him beg your boyfriend for,
like,two decades,and my father?

32:19.557 --> 32:25.132
-Honey,oh,god,it is--it is complicated.
-It seems pretty simple to me,mom.

32:25.655 --> 32:29.630
You were willing to be sloppy seconds
for some rich jerk with a wife and kids.

32:29.977 --> 32:32.753
And my dad didn't want to fess up to having
a bastard child with his mistress

32:32.858 --> 32:35.932
'cause he didn't want to risk his
norman rockwell life. Do I have it straight,mom?

32:36.238 --> 32:39.722
No,I know that you're angry,
but you need to hear me though.

32:39.908 --> 32:43.112
Why? It's too late to do anything about it.
He's dead.

32:44.286 --> 32:50.023
-Yes...but--but you- -how much of it is mine?

32:50.308 --> 32:51.433
Wh-what?

32:51.635 --> 32:55.360
The money that william walker left you,
how much of it is mine?

32:56.766 --> 33:04.783
I-I put $2 million in a trust in your name,
and it will be yours when you're 25.

33:06.375 --> 33:09.520
Well,I guess that's better than
some stupid doll.

33:22.286 --> 33:24.743
hey. Dude, I am so screwed.

33:25.055 --> 33:29.513
I'm so glad it's you and not my mom,
or my brothers or my sister, or indeed my half-sister.

33:29.618 --> 33:31.733
Could my life get any more complicated?

33:32.715 --> 33:34.660
-What's up?
-Did you even hear what I said?

33:35.827 --> 33:41.260
A countdown clock...dean silk is counting out the
days still I come out on his friggin' web site.

33:41.457 --> 33:45.031
"Chad barry, come out, come out,
wherever you are" That son of a bitch!

33:45.358 --> 33:48.350
What I can't figure out is why is
this guy gunning for me?

33:51.885 --> 33:55.423
Oh,no.
You called him.

33:57.487 --> 34:04.712
No,I--yes. Yes, I did.
I thought I...I thought I could convince him to leave you alone.

34:05.245 --> 34:08.360
You think you're the first lawyer ever
and try and scare this asswipe?

34:08.588 --> 34:12.830
He makes his living from screwing with
people's personal lives.  You just egged him on.

34:14.688 --> 34:15.989
You promised you wouldn't do anything.

34:16.098 --> 34:20.882
I'm sorry,chad. I come from a long line of people who are
incapable of leaving well enough alone.

34:21.476 --> 34:27.321
If you had any respect for how important my
career is to me, you would've listened and
not gone behind my back.

34:28.088 --> 34:29.420
You're right.

34:29.657 --> 34:30.889
-You're absolutely right.
-Yeah.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.130
I'm sorry.

34:34.226 --> 34:35.991
I am sorry.

34:38.605 --> 34:41.610
So. Where do we go from here?

34:43.538 --> 34:45.130
I'll tell you where we won't go--

34:45.376 --> 34:52.161
out to the movies, out to dinner,
shopping, hiking, the gym...

34:52.266 --> 34:54.070
I'm all for cutting out the gym.

34:56.927 --> 35:00.361
No,the shipment was for 1400, not 14.

35:02.138 --> 35:04.423
Look, just deal with it. Okay?

35:05.358 --> 35:08.092
Do you have any idea...

35:08.298 --> 35:12.690
what you have done to my life and to rebecca's?

35:12.888 --> 35:15.653
-What I've done, are you serious?
-My god.

35:16.936 --> 35:20.222
As a mother,how--how could you be that cruel?

35:20.397 --> 35:21.961
My daughter is crushed.

35:22.068 --> 35:27.021
Her whole identity, everything
that we had--our--our relationship--

35:27.128 --> 35:31.753
has been--been decimated,
and all for what,out of spite?

35:32.356 --> 35:35.551
So--so that you could get even with me?

35:35.825 --> 35:37.532
But I just told her the truth.

35:37.725 --> 35:44.190
I was planning on telling her everything,
on my timetable, in my way.

35:45.245 --> 35:47.941
It was not your place.

35:48.215 --> 35:52.372
My place?
Oh,you are unbelievable.

35:52.926 --> 35:56.443
It wasn't your place to have an affair
with a married man.

35:56.685 --> 35:59.180
It wasn't your place to have my father's child.

35:59.286 --> 36:02.702
It certainly wasn't your place to come
crawling out of the woodwork

36:02.806 --> 36:06.673
and demand a piece of our family business,
but none of that stopped you,did it?

36:06.865 --> 36:09.093
You' done nothing but cause my family pain.

36:09.197 --> 36:12.210
So if you're perfect little world has come
crashing down around you

36:12.315 --> 36:16.470
because the truth has finally come out,
you know what? Join the damn club.

36:16.677 --> 36:20.893
I let you treat me like dirt because
I loved and respected your father.

36:22.238 --> 36:26.330
But I am done treating you
with any measure of civility.

36:26.927 --> 36:28.692
Is that a threat?

36:29.555 --> 36:32.622
You bet your ass it's a threat.

36:34.145 --> 36:36.891
And you...
i trusted you.

36:37.165 --> 36:39.013
Holly,I had to do what was best for my family.

36:39.216 --> 36:41.271
Don't you ever call me again.

36:41.378 --> 36:43.140
I'm sorry you feel that way.

36:43.336 --> 36:46.121
Not sorry enough.

36:59.768 --> 37:01.261
what you reading?

37:03.536 --> 37:07.953
"Seeing with serenity: How to cope with
what life deals you"

37:08.237 --> 37:11.522
I took a trip to the self-help
section at the bookstore.

37:11.826 --> 37:16.711
So far it's just pages and pages
of vague platitudes.

37:18.087 --> 37:20.803
Mom ,you've been avoiding my calls.

37:22.248 --> 37:24.451
I didn't know what I wanted to say.

37:25.357 --> 37:29.922
Look,I wish I could turn back the clock and
make a different decision,mom, but I can't.

37:31.256 --> 37:35.900
-I know.
-You seem angrier at me than kevin or tommy. Am I wrong?

37:40.096 --> 37:41.840
Probably not.

37:43.756 --> 37:47.260
you hold me to a different
standard than anyone else.

37:47.525 --> 37:49.600
That's not fair.

37:49.617 --> 37:51.323
Yes.

37:52.388 --> 37:54.452
You're right.
It's not fair.

37:56.158 --> 37:58.542
I just always felt this connection with you.

37:59.857 --> 38:02.722
I mean,you raise a boy, and you don't
expect them to tell you anything.

38:02.828 --> 38:06.103
You're lucky if they acknowledge you
on their way out the door.

38:10.817 --> 38:14.920
But you...always confided in me.

38:15.638 --> 38:18.661
I felt like you trusted me to handle
whatever came along.

38:19.198 --> 38:23.430
I never had that relationship with my mother.
I always thought I had it with you.

38:24.515 --> 38:29.312
mom,we do have that relationship. The last thing
 in the world I wanted to do was hurt you.

38:30.675 --> 38:32.283
I know.

38:34.596 --> 38:36.932
But that doesn't mean you didn't.

38:44.886 --> 38:46.330
justin.

38:49.748 --> 38:53.022
I...get the feeling you're not here to see me.

38:53.426 --> 38:56.291
No,I'm not.

38:56.665 --> 38:59.273
Is rebecca here?

39:01.987 --> 39:06.351
rebecca, this is justin, justin walker.

39:06.847 --> 39:10.483
So you're one of them,his family?

39:11.597 --> 39:13.211
Yeah.

39:14.556 --> 39:17.710
-I got it,mom.
-Okay.

39:26.376 --> 39:29.132
if you're expecting tears
from me,you can forget it.

39:29.215 --> 39:31.661
I'm not expecting anything.

39:33.278 --> 39:36.020
I just wanted to meet you.

39:37.668 --> 39:42.291
Well,I'm here.
I'm real. You can even touch me.

39:46.078 --> 39:50.161
-uh,you--you wanna walk?
-Okay.

39:53.347 --> 39:56.382
It's so bizarre. We live, like, 15 minutes away. In L.A...

39:56.465 --> 39:58.771
that's practically being neighbors.

39:59.935 --> 40:01.372
Where'd you go to school?

40:01.776 --> 40:03.820
I started at la salle.

40:04.228 --> 40:05.401
Swanky.

40:05.616 --> 40:09.093
Well,I got kicked out junior year,
and then I finished up at,uh,san marino.

40:09.458 --> 40:12.463
-What about you?
-Marshall.I think we played you in football.

40:13.216 --> 40:16.121
-Uh,didn't play football.
-Oh,that's good. I hate it.

40:20.575 --> 40:23.632
uh,marshall?
Uh,did you know a carter espen?

40:23.735 --> 40:25.783
Oh,god.
Totally.

40:26.096 --> 40:28.762
-he used to date this girl rebecca.
-Yeah,that was me. ...

40:30.707 --> 40:32.981
okay, I'm officially freaked out now.

40:34.355 --> 40:36.541
I mean,what if we had met?

40:37.495 --> 40:38.831
What if we--oh...

40:39.116 --> 40:41.131
oh,the greek tragedy of it all.

40:43.867 --> 40:46.722
so...what do you do?

40:49.466 --> 40:51.370
presently, not much.

40:53.207 --> 40:55.231
I'm a--I'm a vet.
I was in afghanistan.

40:55.715 --> 40:57.630
Afghanistan.

40:59.037 --> 41:02.782
-That must've been intense.
-Uh, yeah, it was.

41:03.345 --> 41:06.842
So... you and carter...
I can't believe that.
