00:53.966 --> 00:56.134
<i>Take a deep breath...</i>

00:56.234 --> 00:58.351
<i>and start at the beginning.</i>

01:00.506 --> 01:02.041
<i>Tell them how we first met.</i>

01:02.141 --> 01:03.707
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:07.548 --> 01:08.608
Alex Stewart!

01:09.948 --> 01:14.418
<i>Tell them that ever since
we shared our dreams...</i>

01:16.728 --> 01:18.548
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:19.324 --> 01:21.194
I had a dream last night.

01:21.294 --> 01:23.596
<i>...even Alex's weirdest ones.</i>

01:23.696 --> 01:25.503
You know a rowing boat?

01:25.603 --> 01:29.566
That little curvy bit the oar sits in?

01:29.768 --> 01:31.972
- It's called a rollock by the way.
- A what?

01:32.072 --> 01:35.573
Rollock, like "bollock" with an "R."

01:36.308 --> 01:39.043
That was me. I was that thing.

01:42.448 --> 01:45.816
<i>No. Keep that as our secret.</i>

01:46.415 --> 01:49.219
Rosie? Rosie, it's time.

01:50.155 --> 01:52.156
<i>Tell them that this is,</i>

01:53.227 --> 01:55.562
<i>- that this has to be...</i>
- Everybody!

01:55.662 --> 01:59.831
<i>...one of the happiest days of my life.</i>

01:59.931 --> 02:01.465
Please!

02:05.371 --> 02:10.840
For those I haven't had the...
chance to say hi to properly,

02:11.309 --> 02:12.610
I'm Rosie.

02:14.614 --> 02:19.483
And this has got to be one
of the happiest days of my life.

02:38.003 --> 02:39.962
Shots!

02:45.410 --> 02:47.912
- Yeah! Beyonce!
- Yeah!

03:41.700 --> 03:43.470
- Hi, Alex.
- How's it going, mate?

03:43.570 --> 03:45.169
All right.

03:46.038 --> 03:48.171
It's Alex!

03:48.273 --> 03:51.077
It was totally my fault,
the whole thing.

03:51.177 --> 03:55.048
I'd love to believe you, Alex, I really would.
I just happen to know my own daughter.

03:55.148 --> 03:58.018
A fine doctor you're gonna make
if this is how you carry on.

03:58.118 --> 04:00.584
Why is everybody shouting?

04:04.556 --> 04:07.027
I'm so embarrassed about last night.

04:07.127 --> 04:09.493
No, no, you don't have to be.

04:11.730 --> 04:14.347
I behaved so badly!

04:17.269 --> 04:19.839
Yeah, but bad can be good, too.

04:19.940 --> 04:24.508
Good? It was awful.
Oh, I feel sick even thinking about it.

04:26.578 --> 04:28.681
About which part?

04:28.781 --> 04:33.283
All of it. It never happened.
Alex, okay? You can't tell anyone!

04:34.452 --> 04:35.820
Right.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.159
Rosie had her stomach pumped

04:37.259 --> 04:39.285
- Rosie had her stomach pumped
- Piss, off!

04:41.043 --> 04:42.592
Go, go, go!

04:43.162 --> 04:45.462
How did we get home from the hospital?

04:46.297 --> 04:47.967
Mom picked us up.

04:48.067 --> 04:51.170
They needed a parent's name, so,
I obviously didn't want to give yours.

04:51.326 --> 04:54.538
And she thinks it's my fault anyway,
I'm a terrible influence. Blah, blah, blah.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.342
Oh, well, you are.

04:56.442 --> 05:01.514
So, now, I have to spend two hours
in the library every day for a fortnight.

05:01.614 --> 05:04.181
- Nightmare.
- Well, it could be worse.

05:05.551 --> 05:08.834
Bethany Williams has just
got a part time job there.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.724
- Yeah, right.
- What?

05:11.824 --> 05:13.660
Bethany Williams?

05:13.760 --> 05:16.129
Forget it, even I want
to sleep with her.

05:16.429 --> 05:21.165
For your information,
she has been giving me the eye.

05:21.265 --> 05:24.137
Why you haven't squeezed
that zit on your forehead.

05:24.237 --> 05:26.806
- Fuck off!
- No. Come here. I can do it for you.

05:26.906 --> 05:29.439
Don't touch me! Don't you dare!

05:57.469 --> 06:01.271
Just look at Greg right now.
What a bimbo.

06:01.571 --> 06:05.743
Seriously hot, though.
He invited me to the school dance.

06:09.823 --> 06:10.951
What did you say?

06:11.251 --> 06:14.084
No, obviously. I'm going with you.

06:14.753 --> 06:16.456
Hey, Alex.

06:16.856 --> 06:18.455
I missed you in the library today.

06:21.134 --> 06:24.097
Yeah, I had nothing...

06:24.197 --> 06:27.033
I mean, yeah. I was a bit...
A bit of busy...

06:27.133 --> 06:29.302
- Don't be a stranger.
- Yeah.

06:29.766 --> 06:31.501
Yeah, absolutely not.

06:33.004 --> 06:34.107
I'll see you there.

06:34.207 --> 06:35.942
- Hey, girls!
- What did he say to you?

06:36.625 --> 06:39.579
- Pathetic.
- She's mine for the taking.

06:39.679 --> 06:43.248
You're lucky she didn't trip over your tongue
dragging halfway across the ground.

06:43.348 --> 06:46.319
Whoa. Okay. All right.

06:46.419 --> 06:49.355
Well, give me some tips then,
if you are so clever.

06:49.455 --> 06:53.659
How do I go about seducing a woman
who is apparently out of my league?

06:53.759 --> 06:55.926
- Is that a serious question?
- Yeah, absolutely.

06:57.128 --> 07:02.634
Well, you're at a disadvantage
being a... you know, virgin.

07:02.734 --> 07:05.772
No, no, no, all right?
We can work with that.

07:05.872 --> 07:08.007
First you have to be cool. Ignore her.

07:08.107 --> 07:11.444
- Act like you could take it or leave it.
- You see, that I've had practice at.

07:11.544 --> 07:15.974
Second, you have to make her feel like
you've seen something in her no one else has.

07:16.074 --> 07:18.418
Like her soul.

07:18.518 --> 07:20.753
- While also ignoring her?
- Yes.

07:21.701 --> 07:26.191
- Okay, and what happened to the sex?
- This is about the sex!

07:26.418 --> 07:30.227
- God! You're so fucked up.
- You have no idea.

07:35.267 --> 07:38.750
She wants me to take her to the dance.

07:39.251 --> 07:42.406
- Really?
- Yeah, imagine.

07:44.277 --> 07:45.865
Take her,

07:46.165 --> 07:48.328
if it means that much to you.

07:52.150 --> 07:54.849
Come on. You'd have no one to go with.

07:55.688 --> 07:59.718
I got asked by the fittest guy
in our year, Alex. I think I'm fine.

08:00.493 --> 08:05.297
What, so actually this is
quite convenient for you.

08:05.922 --> 08:07.564
Yeah.

08:10.469 --> 08:13.538
All right. Well, yeah,
I'll go ask her then.

08:14.149 --> 08:15.605
Go for it.

08:17.942 --> 08:19.709
Okay. Fine, I will.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.981
- Bethany? Bethany, hi.
- Hey.

08:25.794 --> 08:27.250
Yeah!

08:43.934 --> 08:46.042
<i>Your face is annoying me.</i>

08:48.071 --> 08:51.548
Come on. I've got news.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.286
<i>Me, too.</i>

08:53.846 --> 08:57.314
<i>I need to concentrate so I can
pass my exams and get a life.</i>

09:25.717 --> 09:26.910
Not Bethany!

09:28.857 --> 09:29.697
Fuck!

09:30.550 --> 09:34.653
Right, Rosie Dunne, get yourself down
to the headmaster's office.

09:34.753 --> 09:38.691
No, no, no, it was my fault, Mr. Simpson.
I had something I needed to tell her.

09:38.791 --> 09:41.892
So I see, Alex. Congratulations.

09:45.363 --> 09:47.404
Yes, Alex!

10:19.197 --> 10:22.999
I know we're not officially talking,
but I need help with my tie.

10:26.805 --> 10:29.375
For a minute there, I thought you might
be in love with me or something.

10:29.475 --> 10:34.747
Alex, you will forever be the boy who wiped
bogeys on my favorite party dress, okay?

10:34.847 --> 10:37.450
- Don't flatter yourself.
- Good.

10:37.550 --> 10:40.753
I know boy-girl friendships can be
quite complicated sometimes,

10:40.853 --> 10:44.354
but you know I'm always here
if you need to talk.

10:47.258 --> 10:49.260
What do you think?

10:49.360 --> 10:52.695
Boobs <i>au naturel</i> or pushed up?

10:53.557 --> 10:56.599
In? Or out?

10:58.803 --> 11:00.419
Well...

11:01.219 --> 11:05.424
I mean, it depends.
Is it for dancing, or is it...

11:08.379 --> 11:10.299
Who knows?

11:11.516 --> 11:13.586
So, where is this tool
meant to be meeting you?

11:13.686 --> 11:17.522
You're so rude! I think at the front.

11:20.316 --> 11:22.058
Hey, gorgeous.

11:26.846 --> 11:28.433
See ya!

11:30.434 --> 11:31.368
Wanker.

12:25.111 --> 12:26.979
Okay.

12:29.727 --> 12:31.428
Fuck!

12:37.235 --> 12:38.941
Oh, just...

12:41.473 --> 12:44.577
- You have done this before?
- Yeah. Haven't you?

12:44.677 --> 12:46.747
It's like brushing my teeth.

12:47.012 --> 12:48.745
Bollocks!

12:50.983 --> 12:53.352
- That's... Look, let me help you...
- No, leave it!

12:53.452 --> 12:58.324
Okay, I've got it. Fuck!
Okay, quick! Quick, okay.

12:58.424 --> 13:00.757
Here we go! Okay, quick!

13:09.500 --> 13:11.363
Sweet Jesus!

13:20.956 --> 13:24.881
- Wow.
- I know. I know.

13:32.991 --> 13:34.193
Okay.

13:34.493 --> 13:37.624
- Where is it?
- What?

13:37.996 --> 13:39.550
The thing.

13:39.950 --> 13:41.303
I don't know.

13:41.403 --> 13:43.708
Seriously, Greg, where is it?

13:44.118 --> 13:45.538
You had it!

13:45.738 --> 13:48.337
Look, it can't have just disappeared!

13:51.242 --> 13:54.710
Oh, God! Oh, shit!

13:55.610 --> 13:57.738
<i>Aserejé ja de jé</i>

13:57.838 --> 14:00.921
<i>De jebe tu de jebere sebiunouva majavi</i>

14:01.021 --> 14:03.266
<i>An de bugui an de buididipí</i>

14:03.366 --> 14:05.609
<i>Aserejé ja de jé</i>

14:05.709 --> 14:08.619
<i>De jebe tu de jebere sebiunouva majavi</i>

14:08.719 --> 14:10.590
<i>An de bugui an de buididipí</i>

14:13.164 --> 14:15.898
Rosie? Have you found it?

14:16.767 --> 14:18.265
Do you want me to have a look for you?

14:18.765 --> 14:20.220
Really?

14:20.320 --> 14:22.983
- Yeah, go on all fours.
- Bugger off!

14:30.348 --> 14:31.917
<i>- Rosie!</i>
- Alex! Thank God! Where are you?

14:32.017 --> 14:34.391
<i>- I'm on my way out!</i>
- No, wait, you've got to help me,

14:34.491 --> 14:36.856
- there's been an accident!
- <i>Christ, what?</i>

14:36.956 --> 14:38.758
No, no, no, sorry, no,
that's what I meant. Everything's fine.

14:38.858 --> 14:40.026
<i>Jesus, you scared me!</i>

14:40.126 --> 14:43.295
I mean, there was an accident,
with the thingy with Greg, you know?

14:43.395 --> 14:45.303
<i>Well, that happens, Rosie!</i>

14:45.403 --> 14:48.385
No, no, Alex. Something that I need
to figure out right now, Alex.

14:48.485 --> 14:51.671
I need to get rid of it. It got lost and I
can't find it and I don't know what to do.

14:51.771 --> 14:55.574
You're not making any sense, Rosie!
Can we just talk about this later?

14:55.674 --> 14:57.343
<i>No, Alex, please!</i>

14:57.443 --> 15:00.708
Okay, you need to be
really clear and really precise!

15:00.808 --> 15:02.245
Okay!

15:02.480 --> 15:07.083
The condom came off inside my vagina
and at present I'm unable to locate it!

15:12.523 --> 15:14.791
That's way more information
than I needed.

15:18.496 --> 15:21.293
Hi. I'm Dick.

15:22.099 --> 15:24.000
Of course, you are.

15:26.637 --> 15:28.771
Okay.

15:34.312 --> 15:36.679
Is it... front bottom or back?

15:37.281 --> 15:38.818
What do you think I am?

15:38.918 --> 15:42.218
Sorry. I wasn't suggesting
you're a slag or anything.

15:51.696 --> 15:53.162
Isn't there a female nurse?

15:54.064 --> 15:56.633
I'm afraid I'm all you've got.

16:13.819 --> 16:17.487
That was one of the most embarrassing
moments of my entire pathetic existence.

16:28.599 --> 16:30.433
You know what?

16:31.269 --> 16:33.138
Let's get out of here.

16:33.238 --> 16:35.497
Dino's should still be open.

16:37.975 --> 16:40.747
I was thinking more Boston,
Massachusetts.

16:41.279 --> 16:44.503
- Oh, you think I should flee the country?
- I'm serious.

16:44.603 --> 16:49.585
This... this place is a dead end,
we've been saying it for years.

16:50.788 --> 16:56.325
And... my dad wants me to try
for a scholarship at Harvard.

16:58.963 --> 17:00.329
You are serious.

17:02.533 --> 17:06.318
It's one of the best medical
schools in the world. And...

17:07.637 --> 17:12.642
Boston College happens to have a
really great hotel management course.

17:16.214 --> 17:17.981
That is what you want to do, isn't it?

17:22.486 --> 17:23.720
You can't!

17:24.387 --> 17:28.594
I mean, who'll do your washing?
You'll never eat! It's ridiculous!

17:28.694 --> 17:31.630
They have food in America, Mom,
and I'm guessing washing machines.

17:31.730 --> 17:35.706
It's so far away!
I mean, talk to her, Dennis!

17:38.202 --> 17:40.305
It works for me.
I mean, this is as far as I got.

17:40.405 --> 17:43.906
I know, but Mom's just being Mom.
It would be so much fun.

17:45.209 --> 17:47.844
Did you ever want more, Dad?

17:49.180 --> 17:52.651
Do you know what your Gran's
favorite phrase was?

17:52.751 --> 17:55.286
"Not for the likes of us."

17:55.386 --> 17:58.324
When you told us of your plan, it was
the first thing that popped into my head.

17:58.424 --> 18:00.957
I could hear her voice
in the room saying it.

18:02.326 --> 18:05.328
I don't want that voice
in your head, ever.

18:06.630 --> 18:08.442
Here, let me.

18:15.072 --> 18:18.374
I want my own hotel one day.
Is it crazy to think like that?

18:20.611 --> 18:24.413
I've been winging it with you for 18 years,
pretending I was the one in charge.

18:25.783 --> 18:30.322
You're amazing, Rosie. There's nothing
you can't do, if you put your mind to it.

18:30.422 --> 18:32.955
But if I go to Boston,
Mom will never speak to me again.

18:33.824 --> 18:37.067
Well, if you don't go, I won't.

18:37.194 --> 18:39.128
The choice is yours.

18:40.831 --> 18:42.664
Dennis!

18:46.737 --> 18:50.273
Do me a favor.
Come back and take that prick's job.

18:57.532 --> 18:58.481
Good evening!

19:28.579 --> 19:30.020
"Dear Miss Dunne, congratulations!

19:30.120 --> 19:32.618
We are pleased to offer you
a seat at Boston University!"

19:32.718 --> 19:34.951
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
No way! Oh, my God!

19:51.469 --> 19:54.337
- Oh, hey, Clare, is Alex in?
- He's tied up.

19:54.839 --> 19:58.574
- I can come back.
- He'll be down in about three minutes?

20:00.644 --> 20:01.678
Cup of tea?

20:14.225 --> 20:17.340
Baby! Oh, baby!

20:17.440 --> 20:19.261
Oh, yeah.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.403
Yeah, baby, show me, come on, baby!

20:26.238 --> 20:28.304
Oh, my God, is...

20:28.806 --> 20:30.742
- Is that?
- Bethany.

20:30.942 --> 20:33.937
- So, when you said he was...
- Tied up.

20:34.137 --> 20:36.115
- You actually meant...
- Tied up.

20:36.915 --> 20:40.916
- I should... go.
- Any second now.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.157
- Oh, Alex.
- "Oh, Alex.

20:45.257 --> 20:48.725
"Where did you learn to do that?"

20:53.932 --> 20:57.165
I know. It's so gross.

21:07.311 --> 21:08.845
Hello?

21:10.081 --> 21:13.295
Fuck! I'm coming!

21:20.124 --> 21:21.527
Are you supposed to smoke in here?

21:21.927 --> 21:24.769
My parents own the place.
They want me to help out?

21:24.869 --> 21:27.233
I'll set the terms. What's up?

21:27.433 --> 21:30.238
Oh, right. I've been feeling sick
like, every day.

21:30.338 --> 21:31.968
Maybe you could just give me
a pill or something.

21:32.870 --> 21:34.173
- Any diarrhea?
- No.

21:34.273 --> 21:35.307
- Fever?
- No.

21:35.407 --> 21:36.908
- Stomach cramps?
- No.

21:37.513 --> 21:38.841
Well, have you missed a period?

21:44.715 --> 21:45.748
Yeah.

21:52.723 --> 21:54.059
- No.
- Virgin?

21:54.185 --> 21:58.194
- No, but I took the morning-after pill!
- 90% safe. 10% is the catch.

22:02.466 --> 22:04.967
There's a loo here
if you want to use it.

22:09.239 --> 22:11.442
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

22:22.419 --> 22:24.353
Bollocks.

22:26.809 --> 22:29.422
<i>Alex, are you there? Can we meet?</i>

22:37.267 --> 22:40.772
<i>I'd love to, but Bethany's parents
are taking us out to dinner at the Hazel.</i>

22:40.972 --> 22:43.539
<i>How posh is that?</i>

24:10.294 --> 24:12.120
Okay. I'm sorry.

24:12.463 --> 24:14.198
I... I...

24:14.897 --> 24:16.600
I've got news.

24:16.700 --> 24:19.557
- Me, too.
- Read it.

24:28.245 --> 24:30.605
Scholarship to Harvard!

24:32.049 --> 24:35.253
Alex, that's so great. Congratulations.

24:35.353 --> 24:38.257
It's unbelievable, right?

24:38.657 --> 24:40.885
Have you heard back
from Boston College, yet?

24:42.452 --> 24:43.592
No.

24:45.797 --> 24:48.667
- Yeah, you'll get in.
- What about Bethany? Have you told her?

24:49.155 --> 24:51.102
She'll be fine.

24:51.202 --> 24:54.539
She's got this... Oh, God,
she's got this thing about my hair.

24:54.639 --> 24:56.308
- Yeah.
- But she literally yanks it.

24:56.408 --> 24:58.774
And she pulls this funny face
during sex like this...

24:59.310 --> 25:01.777
- I think she likes it.
- Enough. Enough.

25:03.314 --> 25:06.117
Don't you care what she's gonna
think about you rushing off like this?

25:06.563 --> 25:09.087
- All right, what is it?
- What?

25:09.187 --> 25:11.468
Well, you're defending Bethany.
What's wrong?

25:11.568 --> 25:13.122
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

25:15.626 --> 25:17.599
I thought you'd be happier.

25:17.699 --> 25:21.132
We're on our way to Boston!
Come on! Hey?

25:21.232 --> 25:23.034
It's great. It's great, really.

25:24.467 --> 25:27.488
- Well done.
- What, come on, you're coming, too!

25:27.588 --> 25:33.006
My flight's in three days, which gives me
time to get settled in before term starts.

25:33.506 --> 25:35.364
You need to go ahead
and book your ticket.

25:35.464 --> 25:37.079
Sure.

25:37.181 --> 25:41.912
I... have got some stuff
to sort first, but...

25:42.507 --> 25:44.216
I'll be there.

25:48.259 --> 25:50.462
- Don't get blown up by terrorists.
- Okay.

25:50.562 --> 25:52.431
Or lose cabin pressure
and fall out of the sky.

25:52.531 --> 25:54.866
- Rosie, wait, wait, wait...
- Or fly into a flock of birds. I mean it!

25:54.966 --> 25:57.068
I can delay, if you need me to.

25:59.169 --> 26:01.737
No. You're getting on that plane.

26:03.273 --> 26:04.759
I've got you something.

26:04.859 --> 26:07.944
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

26:09.146 --> 26:12.814
Give me your finger.
Okay. Keep it there.

26:21.037 --> 26:22.434
North America.

27:14.211 --> 27:16.278
Keep in touch, okay?

27:18.801 --> 27:20.182
Okay.

27:22.552 --> 27:25.403
See you in two weeks, so...

27:32.362 --> 27:33.993
Boston.

27:36.563 --> 27:37.500
This way?

28:03.994 --> 28:06.831
If I'd told him, he'd never have left and his
whole life would have been ruined, too.

28:06.931 --> 28:08.366
I mean, what's the point?

28:08.466 --> 28:11.069
How noble. I'd have forced
the bastard to stay.

28:11.169 --> 28:15.139
Oh, no, no. He's not the dad.
That's just some other loser.

28:15.811 --> 28:18.877
You are turning out to be
a lot more interesting than you look.

28:18.977 --> 28:22.736
- Why don't you just get rid of the thing?
- My parents are Catholic.

28:22.836 --> 28:26.481
I don't believe in all that,
but I can't!

28:26.850 --> 28:29.220
Oh, I had it all sussed!

28:29.320 --> 28:33.925
Move to Boston, study, get a great job,
at 27, come back and open a hotel.

28:34.025 --> 28:37.495
- Then get married and have kids.
- Wow. A whole life in bullet points.

28:37.595 --> 28:40.932
Yeah, well now, it's pregnant,
have sprog, full-time mother,

28:41.032 --> 28:44.669
wave goodbye to career,
live off benefits, grow fat, lose hair.

28:44.769 --> 28:49.436
Yeah. You might as well just kill
yourself now. I can sort the drugs.

28:50.574 --> 28:51.747
Look.

28:51.847 --> 28:56.312
There's loads of people out there that want
a kid that can't have one. Give it away.

28:58.648 --> 29:01.149
I could still move to Boston.

29:01.920 --> 29:05.123
I can apply to college again,
or get a job. I don't care.

29:05.223 --> 29:07.459
So it would all be the same,
just six months later. I mean,

29:07.559 --> 29:09.995
I don't even need to tell Alex,
I could just think of an excuse.

29:10.095 --> 29:12.729
Whoa. That's major denial, babe.

29:12.931 --> 29:14.432
Yeah.

29:14.532 --> 29:17.365
I just happen to think
it's the way to go.

29:26.845 --> 29:28.713
- Who's that?
- Alex.

29:28.813 --> 29:30.048
Have you told him yet?

29:30.148 --> 29:33.284
I'm sending him my arrival time in Boston.
That's all he needs to know.

29:33.384 --> 29:36.318
All this fibbing is gonna
catch up with you, girl.

29:38.923 --> 29:41.390
The way that thing burst out of her.

29:41.859 --> 29:43.867
- That might happen to you!
- It might.

29:44.694 --> 29:47.766
Her whole belly will erupt.
Blood and guts.

29:47.866 --> 29:51.136
And this freakish alien will
leap out and bite your head off!

29:51.636 --> 29:54.873
Stop it, the pair of you!
Pregnancy is a sacred thing!

29:55.073 --> 29:57.041
- It can't hear us.
- Yes, it can!

29:57.141 --> 30:00.411
- And don't refer to it as "it."
- It's a girl if you must know.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.400
You found out?

30:02.500 --> 30:04.383
I asked at the last scan.

30:04.483 --> 30:07.049
I thought I should tell the social worker
so he can start his plans.

30:07.651 --> 30:09.607
A girl!

30:10.221 --> 30:14.556
- What about names?
- No, I'll let the new parents decide.

30:15.358 --> 30:16.662
- Give us a peek.
- Hey!

30:16.823 --> 30:20.498
A woman's body doesn't become public property
just because she is pregnant, you know.

30:20.598 --> 30:21.730
Be my guest.

30:26.970 --> 30:29.187
Look at that!

30:30.107 --> 30:33.084
Oh, my God!

30:34.211 --> 30:36.281
She's got hiccups!

30:36.670 --> 30:38.213
The little thing's got hiccups!

30:38.949 --> 30:41.339
Oh, bless!

30:42.719 --> 30:44.525
Whatever.

30:56.433 --> 30:58.900
Baby, can you hear me?

31:03.841 --> 31:07.975
Try holding your breath like this.

31:15.919 --> 31:18.553
There you are, Katie girl!

31:22.659 --> 31:27.128
That's probably not going to
be your name, okay?

31:33.670 --> 31:36.574
It's coming! Towels! Hot water!

31:36.674 --> 31:39.241
- Where's the midwife?
- I don't know!

31:40.463 --> 31:42.878
Come in now! Come on!

31:43.246 --> 31:44.883
- Come on!
- Midwife's here!

31:44.983 --> 31:48.850
Let's go! As quick as you like!
She's just right down the hallway.

31:49.621 --> 31:52.754
- All right, okay, breathe, breathe!
- Get out!

31:53.859 --> 31:56.527
Breathe, everything is
going to be all right!

31:56.627 --> 31:59.127
- Being a girl sucks!
- Yeah.

32:03.201 --> 32:05.325
Hello.

32:07.671 --> 32:09.905
That'll be the social worker.

32:11.975 --> 32:14.223
Would you like to hold her?

32:14.579 --> 32:17.252
Or should I bring her
straight downstairs?

32:48.511 --> 32:50.345
Katie.

32:52.349 --> 32:55.013
Sweet little Katie.

33:22.179 --> 33:24.702
I promise, Katie,

33:25.483 --> 33:28.049
I'm going to be a good Mommy.

33:44.156 --> 33:45.893
Katie.

33:46.203 --> 33:48.014
Katie.

33:58.014 --> 34:00.382
It's gonna be okay.

34:02.185 --> 34:06.330
Please. Katie, it's gonna be okay!

34:10.994 --> 34:15.030
- My life's over, Dad!
- Wait 'til you become a grandparent.

34:17.034 --> 34:19.900
Katie, Katie.

34:26.610 --> 34:30.949
You know, I still remember the drive back
from the hospital when you were born.

34:31.049 --> 34:35.241
You screamed blue murder,
the whole bloody journey.

34:36.319 --> 34:38.723
I was so scared,
I jumped three red lights.

34:38.822 --> 34:41.357
- Lost my license.
- You never told me that before.

34:43.126 --> 34:44.359
You weren't part of the club.

34:55.272 --> 34:58.777
<i>In battle to preserve sanity,
must remember following rules.</i>

34:58.877 --> 35:02.344
<i>Number one, never breast feed
in a public place.</i>

35:04.112 --> 35:07.983
<i>Two, never bounce Katie
on knee after feeding.</i>

35:10.020 --> 35:13.220
<i>Three, try not to cry when she cries.</i>

35:13.857 --> 35:16.161
<i>And four, the most important of all,</i>

35:16.261 --> 35:19.327
<i>never assume trouble
isn't around the next corner.</i>

35:19.596 --> 35:22.409
- Laters, girls.
- Bye.

35:42.852 --> 35:44.695
Rosie? Oh, no.

35:44.895 --> 35:48.356
Tragic. Are you okay?

35:50.161 --> 35:53.762
- Tell me that's not yours!
- No!

35:55.098 --> 35:56.735
What, you're a nanny now?

35:56.935 --> 35:59.712
Yeah! You know,
at least it's good money.

36:00.438 --> 36:02.337
I thought you were
going to Boston with Alex.

36:03.206 --> 36:07.311
Oh, no, no, no, I realized children
are the only education you need.

36:08.304 --> 36:10.212
So, who's the dad?

36:13.684 --> 36:15.317
Get it off! Get it off!

36:17.154 --> 36:20.088
- I've got to go!
- Bye, then!

36:38.775 --> 36:40.638
Alex.

36:41.511 --> 36:42.847
What are you doing here?

36:43.047 --> 36:45.617
Just back for the weekend.
Thought I'd surprise you.

36:45.917 --> 36:49.320
Great! Yeah. Let's go for a coffee then.

36:49.420 --> 36:52.754
No, no. Let's stay here.
Why don't you put the kettle on?

37:01.899 --> 37:05.069
- So, what have you been up to?
- Oh, just this and that, you know?

37:05.169 --> 37:07.939
- Nice haircut by the way.
- Yeah, thanks.

37:08.039 --> 37:11.306
- You okay? You seem stressed.
- No! No!

37:11.941 --> 37:13.843
So, how's medicine?

37:13.943 --> 37:16.110
Fascinating. Yeah.

37:16.780 --> 37:18.482
We've just been
doing obstetrics, in fact.

37:18.582 --> 37:20.239
Really?

37:21.484 --> 37:24.488
So much to learn. How do you find
these breast pumps, by the way?

37:24.588 --> 37:27.955
- Some women don't like them.
- Oh, total nightmare.

37:30.159 --> 37:31.828
Oh, God.

37:32.228 --> 37:33.678
How did you...

37:33.778 --> 37:35.263
Bethany.

37:36.766 --> 37:38.500
Fast work.

37:42.605 --> 37:45.015
I was gonna tell you, Alex, I promise.

37:45.115 --> 37:46.665
When?

37:47.544 --> 37:50.945
I didn't want to hold you back.

37:54.417 --> 37:56.954
She's had colic for months.

37:57.054 --> 38:00.989
My whole life is feeding,
winding and nappies.

38:02.259 --> 38:04.607
All I can think about is poo.

38:05.061 --> 38:07.229
How much, when, what color.

38:08.465 --> 38:09.731
I hope you mean hers.

38:16.939 --> 38:19.006
What happened to Greg?

38:19.109 --> 38:23.178
He miraculously got a job
in Ibiza the minute he heard.

38:33.289 --> 38:34.939
Can I be godfather?

38:39.162 --> 38:41.529
I'd love nothing more.

38:55.278 --> 38:58.546
I think not telling you

38:58.648 --> 39:01.016
was a way to keep
the dream alive, you know?

39:03.386 --> 39:08.323
So there was at least someone
out there who still saw me as Rosie.

39:09.659 --> 39:14.562
And not this strange,
new person I've become.

40:26.403 --> 40:28.347
So...

40:28.447 --> 40:32.641
the last time I looked that depressed,
I tried to hang myself with my favorite tie.

40:36.245 --> 40:38.680
Hi, I'm Phil.

40:40.083 --> 40:41.321
Alex.

40:41.421 --> 40:44.316
I've been sent to play fairy godmother.

40:45.388 --> 40:47.122
You don't look the part, mate.

40:48.291 --> 40:52.460
My sister's been driving me crazy.
She wants to know, would you buy her a drink?

40:54.163 --> 40:55.953
Which one is she?

41:01.404 --> 41:03.282
The hot girl from class?

41:03.382 --> 41:07.742
Sally. The bright sunflower
in the family window box.

41:09.879 --> 41:12.050
- Hey!
- Hey!

41:12.150 --> 41:15.917
Everybody has been wondering
why the cute British guy looks so sad.

41:17.386 --> 41:18.973
Sorry.

41:19.589 --> 41:22.526
It's time to realize
you're here with us.

41:22.626 --> 41:25.760
And that we might be fun to be with.

41:31.034 --> 41:33.270
Katie! It's your first Christmas!

41:33.770 --> 41:35.206
I hope you got my present!

41:35.406 --> 41:37.775
<i>Thanks for the book, Alex.
I know she'll love it...</i>

41:38.175 --> 41:39.310
- <i>...one day.</i>
- What is it?

41:39.410 --> 41:42.076
This is my new apartment.

41:42.579 --> 41:44.281
What's this you're doing here, darling?

41:45.040 --> 41:46.317
Handmade hearts.

41:46.417 --> 41:49.119
And here, we have my favorite
<i>Back to the Future</i> poster.

41:49.219 --> 41:51.722
It would look so special
in the bathroom.

41:51.922 --> 41:53.188
Walk to Mommy.

41:53.456 --> 41:55.626
- Come to me.
- Good girl!

41:55.726 --> 41:58.960
Katie, darling,
it's your fourth Christmas.

42:00.997 --> 42:03.164
<i>Did, Mommy get my Christmas card?</i>

42:08.437 --> 42:09.473
Really?

42:09.573 --> 42:14.511
<i>Thanks for Katie's present. She wants me
to tell you she can cycle and count to five.</i>

42:14.611 --> 42:18.078
...three, four, five!

42:18.448 --> 42:22.520
<i>Me, I've got a job and finally
moved out of Mom and Dad's.</i>

42:22.620 --> 42:25.323
Miss Dunne! Welcome back to the hotel!

42:25.423 --> 42:27.525
I believe it's the
penthouse suite for you?

42:27.625 --> 42:29.757
That's right, thanks.

43:15.137 --> 43:18.005
Mommy, Mommy!
It's the first day of school!

43:21.611 --> 43:24.348
I heard some beds

43:24.448 --> 43:26.784
were being stolen recently.

43:26.884 --> 43:29.387
- Isn't that strange?
- Yes, Mommy.

43:29.487 --> 43:32.620
This way, no one can
come in and steal ours.

43:35.524 --> 43:37.058
Are you my daddy?

43:37.760 --> 43:41.796
No! No, he's just a nice man that's
helping Mommy out a bit, that's all.

43:46.036 --> 43:47.071
- Damn!
- What?

43:47.171 --> 43:49.103
It's the wrong key!

44:00.751 --> 44:02.317
- My head!
- Come on, whinger!

44:05.354 --> 44:06.990
Over there! Over there!

44:07.090 --> 44:09.626
- Come on, keep going.
- Quick, quick, Mommy!

44:09.826 --> 44:11.459
Excuse me.

44:14.363 --> 44:17.235
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

44:23.272 --> 44:25.443
You dreamt you were an inanimate object?

44:25.543 --> 44:29.947
Yeah, I mean, come on. An arrow flying
through the air! That's pretty cool.

44:30.347 --> 44:33.584
I don't understand.
How can you be a thing?

44:33.684 --> 44:36.387
I don't know.
I've always had dreams like that.

44:37.287 --> 44:39.721
It sounds to me like
self-esteem issues, sweetie.

44:40.256 --> 44:41.870
You may need to talk to someone.

44:45.128 --> 44:49.032
You know, there are razor hairs
in the bathroom, again today.

44:49.132 --> 44:52.503
- Really?
- You know it gives me allergies.

44:52.803 --> 44:55.205
Next time you have
one of your weird dreams,

44:55.305 --> 45:01.208
maybe you should dream you're
something useful like a vacuum cleaner.

45:01.811 --> 45:05.049
- We have a cleaning lady.
- What do you want?

45:05.149 --> 45:07.782
For her to think
we're a pair of fuck-ups?

45:08.117 --> 45:10.219
That's exactly what we are.

45:24.634 --> 45:27.283
- You okay?
- I've got sand in my eyes.

45:28.271 --> 45:30.405
Look at Mommy!

45:38.715 --> 45:40.782
<i>I dreamt I was an arrow.</i>

45:41.382 --> 45:45.431
<i>The little metal bit right at the tip of
an arrow, whizzing through the air.</i>

46:10.479 --> 46:12.658
What have you told the poor brat?
Are you coming home for dad?

46:12.758 --> 46:15.886
No! Just that he sent me a ticket.
I've got no expectations.

46:15.986 --> 46:17.888
Well, good,
because he's got a girlfriend.

46:17.988 --> 46:20.491
Although you know it's funny,
her name didn't come up once.

46:20.591 --> 46:24.394
Yeah, well, Katie's mature enough to know
that when it comes to men, it doesn't matter.

46:24.494 --> 46:26.731
Yeah, well, Katie also knows
that something must have triggered

46:26.831 --> 46:29.115
his sudden enthusiasm to see
her mom, who, by the way,

46:29.215 --> 46:32.634
knows him better than anyone,
and is clearly the best person to judge!

46:33.469 --> 46:35.102
Oh, and...

46:57.853 --> 47:00.962
All right! Good to see you!

47:02.364 --> 47:06.656
- So, tired? Hungry?
- No. Why?

47:23.419 --> 47:25.252
Come on.

47:27.323 --> 47:29.002
Do you want another?

47:29.725 --> 47:32.359
- Yeah.
- All right. I'll be back, okay?

47:35.056 --> 47:37.751
So, you're new here.

47:38.376 --> 47:41.138
- I'm Jonathan.
- Rosie.

47:41.238 --> 47:44.173
Rosie? So what do you do, Rosie?

47:44.573 --> 47:45.743
I'm a mom!

47:46.043 --> 47:50.845
Is that some kind of, performance thing?
You're a drama major?

47:51.714 --> 47:54.715
I'm a mother of a 5-year-old girl!

47:55.584 --> 47:58.052
Cool! Cool!

47:59.656 --> 48:04.325
Can I get you a drink or something?

48:06.429 --> 48:08.195
A gin and tonic.

48:09.265 --> 48:11.435
- Cell? Car keys?
- Oh, dude. Come on.

48:11.535 --> 48:14.117
- Guys, guys, guys, no, no, no!
- It's happening.

48:14.218 --> 48:15.939
- It's gonna happen!
- Come on, come on! Come on! Please!

48:16.039 --> 48:19.040
- One, two, three!
- Okay, okay! Rosie, Rosie, come on...

48:27.821 --> 48:31.152
- Give me a hand.
- All right.

48:34.824 --> 48:37.091
Come on. Come on! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

48:40.164 --> 48:42.130
You're looking way too hot
right now, Rosie.

48:48.571 --> 48:51.740
Come on, all right, okay.
If you want it like that.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.508
No, no, no!

49:01.385 --> 49:02.984
Bananas?

49:07.690 --> 49:09.557
- Any good?
- No, it's sort of...

49:12.928 --> 49:14.429
Catch.

49:15.831 --> 49:17.364
All right.

49:18.935 --> 49:21.976
"You will live a long and happy life."

49:22.076 --> 49:23.371
- Sweet.
- Oh, can I switch?

49:24.407 --> 49:26.110
- 'Cause you prefer mine?
- I prefer it.

49:26.410 --> 49:30.244
I do, I do. I don't know
what I'm talking about.

49:30.913 --> 49:33.948
Well, you do go here, so you probably
should know what you're talking about.

49:40.723 --> 49:44.258
<i>Strange to think that I could have
lived here and been part of it.</i>

49:45.428 --> 49:48.796
But I don't regret Katie, you know?

49:49.531 --> 49:52.285
I mean, how could I?

49:52.635 --> 49:56.611
She's... she's the most amazing kid.

50:01.777 --> 50:04.311
The weird thing is that...

50:05.982 --> 50:09.116
she reminds me more of you than Greg.

50:10.352 --> 50:13.053
That's probably just 'cause I love her.

50:29.404 --> 50:30.538
We should go.

50:32.574 --> 50:34.426
Yeah.

50:35.378 --> 50:37.014
Seriously cute.

50:37.114 --> 50:39.316
It was a ball of fluff.

50:39.824 --> 50:42.087
No seriously.

50:44.353 --> 50:48.190
Sally. Rosie. Rosie, Sally.

50:48.290 --> 50:50.159
Good morning.

50:50.259 --> 50:51.704
Hi.

50:57.766 --> 51:01.772
- Wow. This should be in a museum.
- Oh, it's nothing.

51:01.872 --> 51:05.960
Just quail egg and asparagus in filo pastry
with a cream of rocket sauce.

51:06.876 --> 51:09.340
Well, my regular is baked beans.

51:10.881 --> 51:14.315
Good old British baked bean.
Zero nutritional value.

51:14.850 --> 51:17.251
Yeah. But good on toast.

51:18.588 --> 51:20.522
Oh, you know I can't drink.

51:20.622 --> 51:24.859
Of course. But how are we going to cope
without the numbing haze of alcohol?

51:26.462 --> 51:30.431
Why can't you drink?
If that's not a rude question?

51:33.602 --> 51:35.271
Alex?

51:37.539 --> 51:38.969
What?

51:49.019 --> 51:50.854
Didn't... Didn't...

51:50.954 --> 51:53.187
Alex and I are pregnant.

51:53.622 --> 51:56.115
Twelve and a half weeks in.

51:59.561 --> 52:01.495
That's wonderful.

52:02.699 --> 52:06.233
Congratulations. Congratulations.

52:07.303 --> 52:11.708
- Alex, you didn't tell me?
- No, I... Sorry, I thought I did.

52:12.108 --> 52:13.774
That's...

52:15.310 --> 52:17.481
Let me help! Shit!

52:17.581 --> 52:19.246
Daddy's antique table! Alex, quick!

52:19.982 --> 52:21.719
- Oh, bollocks.
- Language, please!

52:22.119 --> 52:25.686
- Oh, fuck!
- No! Why can't you just say fudge?

52:40.502 --> 52:43.079
Look what you made me do.

52:45.608 --> 52:48.512
It's fine. It's okay.

52:48.612 --> 52:52.516
We have Herb's vernissage
in an hour... It's...

52:52.616 --> 52:55.282
Everything is gonna be fine.

53:11.967 --> 53:14.134
I'm so sorry.

53:15.071 --> 53:18.842
Sally had this planned for weeks.
It's not for long, okay? I promise.

53:18.942 --> 53:22.045
Sweetie? Dr. Jones is by the
sweet and sour prawn balls!

53:22.145 --> 53:24.915
- He's just...
- Sweetie, not now. Okay?

53:25.015 --> 53:28.151
But he's a senior
thoracic surgeon, Alex.

53:28.251 --> 53:30.953
She's right, Alex. Go on.

53:31.053 --> 53:32.866
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

53:35.391 --> 53:38.929
This image here is one of my favorites.

53:39.029 --> 53:41.727
How to articulate that transient moment

53:41.827 --> 53:46.802
when you see something
through the camera's eye.

53:46.902 --> 53:51.275
It's a little like love at first sight.
Stops you in your tracks.

53:51.375 --> 53:55.278
Suddenly you recognize it
for exactly what it is.

53:55.378 --> 53:57.135
A load of bollocks.

54:02.686 --> 54:06.256
- Rosie! Rosie, where are you going?
- Back home.

54:06.356 --> 54:08.058
And I mean England.
This is too crazy for me, okay?

54:08.158 --> 54:10.060
I walked straight into the middle
of something here!

54:10.160 --> 54:14.598
Look, it's all fine, honestly.
Sally and I just needed to air some stuff!

54:14.698 --> 54:16.564
Oh, good, I'm glad you're fine,
'cause I'm not!

54:17.399 --> 54:19.569
We were out together
the whole night, Alex!

54:19.669 --> 54:23.689
And all the while your girlfriend was at home
expecting a baby! And you didn't say!

54:23.789 --> 54:27.044
Come on, Rosie. Nothing happened,
we were just... We were just having some fun.

54:27.144 --> 54:30.113
That's what you got me
over here for then? Just some fun?

54:30.213 --> 54:33.250
I wanted to see you!
For Christ sake, you're my best friend!

54:33.350 --> 54:37.985
Or maybe you needed someone
from your old life to point out the truth!

54:40.522 --> 54:42.826
- What truth?
- You're in a mess, Alex!

54:42.926 --> 54:46.096
This whole situation
is one big bloody giant mess!

54:46.196 --> 54:47.364
Me? I'm in a mess?

54:47.464 --> 54:49.873
- And you're in denial!
- You're projecting!

54:49.973 --> 54:52.369
Okay, can we just stop
the psychobabble here

54:52.469 --> 54:54.704
and just talk like
English people, please!

54:54.804 --> 54:57.041
Fine! Fine! Fine. Fine. Look.

54:57.341 --> 55:01.445
I was worried you might find it hard,
you know, coming here.

55:01.745 --> 55:05.378
- Hard?
- I mean, you've had a tough time, Rosie, and...

55:05.814 --> 55:10.319
seeing where we live, you know,
our apartment, our lifestyle, it's just...

55:10.494 --> 55:13.657
You thought I was jealous of you? No.

55:13.757 --> 55:15.548
I pity you, Alex!

55:16.162 --> 55:19.229
All I see is someone compensating
for a crap personal life

55:19.329 --> 55:22.433
- by schmoozing his way up the career ladder!
- Crap personal life?

55:22.633 --> 55:26.268
All right, let's see. Stable relationship
with beautiful girlfriend,

55:26.368 --> 55:29.287
lots in common, a great circle
of friends, a kid on the way,

55:29.387 --> 55:31.500
who's gonna have two parents,
by the way, not one!

55:40.816 --> 55:43.650
- Rosie, come on, I...
- Forget it, Alex!

55:44.353 --> 55:48.024
- Go ahead and climb your greasy pole!
- You know, I will!

55:48.224 --> 55:51.161
Just don't come whinging to me
when you realize you're empty inside.

55:51.261 --> 55:53.160
- No danger of that!
- Good!

55:53.896 --> 55:56.613
- Excellent!
- Fantastic!

56:18.102 --> 56:20.531
<i>In a little while from now</i>

56:20.631 --> 56:23.232
<i>If I'm not feeling any less sour</i>

56:23.332 --> 56:28.873
<i>I promised myself to treat myself
and visit a nearby tower</i>

56:28.973 --> 56:31.605
<i>And climbing to the top</i>

56:31.705 --> 56:34.393
<i>Will throw myself off</i>

56:34.493 --> 56:37.242
<i>In an effort to make it clear to who</i>

56:37.342 --> 56:39.806
<i>Ever what it's like when your shattered</i>

56:39.906 --> 56:42.372
<i>Left standing in the lurch</i>

56:42.472 --> 56:45.525
<i>At a church where people're saying</i>

56:45.625 --> 56:48.283
<i>"My God that's tough, she stood him up!</i>

56:48.383 --> 56:51.401
<i>No point in us remaining.</i>

56:51.501 --> 56:53.931
<i>May as well go home."</i>

56:54.031 --> 56:56.703
<i>As I did on my own</i>

56:56.803 --> 57:00.967
<i>Alone again, naturally</i>

57:02.319 --> 57:07.046
<i>It seems to me that there are
more hearts broken in the world</i>

57:07.146 --> 57:12.631
<i>That can't be mended, left unattended</i>

57:12.731 --> 57:15.080
<i>What do we do?</i>

57:15.530 --> 57:17.901
<i>What do we do?</i>

57:24.692 --> 57:27.432
<i>Alone again</i>

57:27.532 --> 57:29.908
<i>Naturally</i>

57:42.404 --> 57:43.941
Oh, no!

57:44.973 --> 57:46.440
Pleased to see me?

57:47.042 --> 57:48.111
What are you doing here?

57:48.211 --> 57:50.781
You sent me Katie's drawing!
I got on the first flight I could!

57:51.181 --> 57:54.117
No! No, no, no!
I did that on a whim, okay?

57:54.217 --> 57:57.420
Katie drew the picture, and it was a mistake!
I never expected you to actually show up!

57:57.520 --> 58:01.657
That letter really made me think about my life!
I wanna meet her, Rosie! I am her dad.

58:02.257 --> 58:03.802
Dad?

58:04.293 --> 58:07.328
And what precisely is it that you think
qualifies you for that title? Those?

58:08.364 --> 58:12.002
Where were you, "Dad" when she woke up with
colic every night for the first few months?

58:12.102 --> 58:15.771
Or cut her first tooth,
or took her first steps?

58:16.173 --> 58:18.672
Has anyone ever told you,
you have the most amazing eyes?

58:26.448 --> 58:30.687
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I get it,
I bailed on you. I was a total creep.

58:30.787 --> 58:32.822
But there hasn't been a single day
in the last five years

58:32.922 --> 58:34.691
that I haven't wondered what she's like.

58:34.791 --> 58:38.027
Is she like me?
Did she luck out on the gene front?

58:38.127 --> 58:39.709
You're so full of shit!

58:46.101 --> 58:49.973
You have to give me a chance, Rosie!
I can be different, I promise.

58:50.373 --> 58:53.243
Do you want me to crawl on my hands and knees?
Anything, Rosie! I'm begging you!

58:53.343 --> 58:56.913
Get up, you idiot. If this were about me,
I'd be driving you to the airport right now!

58:57.013 --> 58:59.215
You'd be right to.

59:01.583 --> 59:03.602
One chance!

59:04.687 --> 59:06.823
One chance,
but any mess-ups and you're out.

59:07.023 --> 59:09.927
And you be nice! And I don't
just mean average nice, I mean,

59:10.027 --> 59:12.896
Father Christmas-Easter
Bunny-Tom-Hanks-all-rolled-into-one nice!

59:12.996 --> 59:14.698
- Yeah.
- And you will buy her...

59:14.898 --> 59:17.896
the most expensive pair of
shitty pink shoes that you can find!

59:19.768 --> 59:21.935
I'm gonna Google them right now.

59:33.548 --> 59:34.719
- Hi-five!
- Boo!

01:00:09.985 --> 01:00:11.919
Wait a minute. You did what?

01:00:13.621 --> 01:00:18.127
Hey! This is a man who let you
go to casualty on your own

01:00:18.227 --> 01:00:21.064
in the middle of the night,
with a condom stuck up your fanny!

01:00:21.164 --> 01:00:23.300
He's Katie's dad.

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.002
You should see her little face
light up when he walks in the room!

01:00:26.102 --> 01:00:28.118
They're really bonding.

01:00:29.171 --> 01:00:32.042
Of course, none of that would matter
if he had a crap bod.

01:00:32.142 --> 01:00:34.641
He's really worked on that thing. Wow.

01:00:35.377 --> 01:00:37.107
You're evil, Rosie Dunne.

01:00:39.181 --> 01:00:41.818
I just want to belong to someone, Ruby.

01:00:41.918 --> 01:00:44.351
I'm tired of waiting.

01:00:44.453 --> 01:00:46.987
And it feels good with him.

01:00:47.656 --> 01:00:49.423
We're a family.

01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:24.127
- Can you just stop jumping up and down?
- I'm just checking everyone's here.

01:01:24.227 --> 01:01:26.829
Everyone being who, exactly?

01:01:26.929 --> 01:01:29.832
- How's the blushing bride?
- Like a mad bunny.

01:01:29.932 --> 01:01:32.398
Okay. Okay.

01:01:36.171 --> 01:01:39.376
Don't take this
the wrong way, love. But...

01:01:39.476 --> 01:01:44.547
if there's any part of you that
isn't sure, even now, say the word.

01:01:44.647 --> 01:01:46.780
We'll walk straight out of here,
our heads held high.

01:01:47.783 --> 01:01:49.049
So you like Greg, then?

01:01:50.385 --> 01:01:52.753
Come on. Let's get you hitched.

01:03:09.998 --> 01:03:11.188
Do you like this?

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:14.667
- Katie, would you please?
- Mom!

01:03:15.871 --> 01:03:17.636
Sorry.

01:03:36.091 --> 01:03:38.160
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Sally...

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:39.794
Rosie.

01:03:41.196 --> 01:03:44.532
- What can I do for you?
- Is Alex there?

01:03:44.832 --> 01:03:46.168
Did he not tell you?

01:03:46.268 --> 01:03:48.905
- <i>Tell me what?</i>
- Alex and I separated.

01:03:49.005 --> 01:03:51.975
- What? When?
- <i>About eight weeks ago?</i>

01:03:52.075 --> 01:03:54.571
Pretty much the day of your wedding.

01:03:59.147 --> 01:04:02.082
- Oh, God!
- <i>What?</i>

01:04:02.951 --> 01:04:05.788
- <i>What?</i>
- I think my water just broke!

01:04:05.888 --> 01:04:09.058
Oh, God! Wait, wait. Are you sure?
Maybe you just wet yourself.

01:04:09.158 --> 01:04:11.494
No, I did not wet myself! Where is Herb?

01:04:11.594 --> 01:04:12.995
- <i>Herb?</i>
- Oh, God.

01:04:13.095 --> 01:04:15.461
<i>- Who, the artist?</i>
- Herb!

01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:17.884
It's happening! The baby!

01:04:18.533 --> 01:04:22.397
It's coming! Herb!

01:05:42.951 --> 01:05:44.184
Katie!

01:05:48.323 --> 01:05:51.127
- Mom! You're supposed to knock!
- The music! It's too loud!

01:05:51.227 --> 01:05:53.793
Can't hear you! The music's too loud!

01:05:54.763 --> 01:05:58.084
- Don't do that!
- Yeah, this music needs to be felt.

01:05:59.401 --> 01:06:01.437
Is that lipstick you're wearing?

01:06:01.537 --> 01:06:04.304
Privacy, Mom! Please!

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.599
Okay!

01:06:08.311 --> 01:06:09.912
Now, have you got the thermal
underwear I gave you?

01:06:10.012 --> 01:06:13.014
- It's the Mediterranean.
- What about cash?

01:06:13.114 --> 01:06:16.631
I've got some extra if you like.
Phone chargers? Your wallet, Dad?

01:06:16.731 --> 01:06:19.087
Rosie, it's fine. Will you stop
fussing like a mother hen?

01:06:19.387 --> 01:06:20.523
Yes.

01:06:20.723 --> 01:06:22.091
- Goodbye!
- Love you.

01:06:22.191 --> 01:06:23.159
- Get in.
- Love you.

01:06:23.359 --> 01:06:24.492
- Bye!
- Bye!

01:06:25.092 --> 01:06:27.126
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:06:29.198 --> 01:06:31.300
<i>So my parents have sold up
and gone backpacking,</i>

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:34.771
<i>while I get to stay to stay at home
nagging a 12-year-old about lipstick.</i>

01:06:34.971 --> 01:06:39.005
I mean, seriously, could you find
further proof of how fucked up my life is?

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:43.711
Bethany?

01:06:43.811 --> 01:06:46.773
Rosie Dunne! You work here now?

01:06:47.949 --> 01:06:50.018
I just got promoted to reception.

01:06:50.618 --> 01:06:52.455
Congratulations!

01:06:52.555 --> 01:06:55.291
But you! Your success,
it's... It's amazing!

01:06:55.991 --> 01:06:58.594
I've just flown from Morocco,
tomorrow I fly out again,

01:06:58.694 --> 01:07:00.897
New York, Boston, Chicago, nightmare.

01:07:00.997 --> 01:07:03.132
- The heart bleeds.
- Yeah.

01:07:03.232 --> 01:07:05.766
Boston? You should look up Alex.

01:07:05.866 --> 01:07:09.672
Really? Alex Stewart?
You guys still keep in touch?

01:07:09.872 --> 01:07:12.775
Of course. He could do
with a friendly face.

01:07:12.875 --> 01:07:15.583
Great! I'll get his details
from you later!

01:07:15.877 --> 01:07:17.408
Thanks.

01:07:17.508 --> 01:07:21.045
Could I have some Evian sent up to my room?
It's the only water I can drink.

01:07:21.145 --> 01:07:24.951
Three bottles.
And maid service twice a day?

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:27.353
Of course.

01:07:30.592 --> 01:07:32.559
That's how fucked-up your life is.

01:07:44.205 --> 01:07:45.244
Mom!

01:07:45.444 --> 01:07:48.908
How is Nice? Have you found
some good places to eat?

01:07:53.949 --> 01:07:56.082
Mom, are you all right?

01:07:57.485 --> 01:07:59.311
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:08:00.021 --> 01:08:01.454
<i>I'm...</i>

01:08:05.093 --> 01:08:06.960
Mom, what is it?

01:08:08.296 --> 01:08:10.491
<i>It's bad news for you.</i>

01:08:11.191 --> 01:08:12.599
Mom?

01:08:13.835 --> 01:08:15.969
Mom, what is it?

01:09:13.594 --> 01:09:14.511
Hey.

01:09:16.163 --> 01:09:17.532
Really?

01:09:18.232 --> 01:09:19.843
Yeah.

01:09:25.774 --> 01:09:27.951
When I heard,

01:09:28.711 --> 01:09:31.746
the years fell away, I was...

01:09:31.845 --> 01:09:34.113
I was a fucked-up kid all over again.

01:09:36.518 --> 01:09:39.752
Hero worshipping
this amazing dad you had.

01:09:54.369 --> 01:09:56.144
Sorry.

01:10:01.909 --> 01:10:04.073
I never got to say goodbye.

01:10:04.412 --> 01:10:07.814
Hey, come here. Come here, you. Hey.

01:10:15.923 --> 01:10:19.104
Hey, hey! Hands off my woman!

01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:26.799
I've just been chatting to your cousin.
She is such a bore.

01:10:28.636 --> 01:10:31.904
Seriously? Are you pissed?

01:10:33.908 --> 01:10:36.245
I find funerals really difficult, Alex.

01:10:36.345 --> 01:10:39.048
'cause Rosie, I mean,
she's having a great time.

01:10:39.248 --> 01:10:42.520
- You know what? Fuck you!
- Please.

01:10:43.785 --> 01:10:47.357
Thanks for turning up.
We both really appreciate your support.

01:10:47.822 --> 01:10:49.656
Let's go, come on.

01:11:02.737 --> 01:11:04.370
<i>Rosie,</i>

01:11:05.207 --> 01:11:09.212
<i>you deserve someone who loves you
with every beat of his heart,</i>

01:11:09.612 --> 01:11:13.947
<i>someone who'll always be there for you,
and who'll love every part of you...</i>

01:11:39.007 --> 01:11:41.243
Mom! I'm not going
without my grey skinny jeans!

01:11:41.343 --> 01:11:43.510
All right! I'll get them for you!

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:05.367
- "Rosie, you deserve someone who..."
- Anything for me?

01:12:05.902 --> 01:12:08.801
Yeah, just this one.

01:12:12.375 --> 01:12:14.155
From Dad.

01:12:14.555 --> 01:12:17.792
- In France, the day before he died.
- Oh, God, don't read that.

01:12:17.892 --> 01:12:20.513
- What?
- Well, it'll upset you.

01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:23.883
I'm already upset.

01:12:24.919 --> 01:12:25.985
Right.

01:12:28.389 --> 01:12:30.481
Do you want me to stay?

01:12:32.427 --> 01:12:34.293
Funnily enough, no.

01:12:35.063 --> 01:12:38.097
Okay. Well, call me if you
need anything, okay?

01:12:51.079 --> 01:12:54.447
<i>Dear Rosie, I can't believe it.</i>

01:12:54.783 --> 01:13:00.052
<i>Here I am at last, finally walking
the Mediterranean coast.</i>

01:13:00.956 --> 01:13:04.527
<i>I've lost count of the years
I've waited for this moment.</i>

01:13:04.627 --> 01:13:06.996
<i>Somehow life got in the way.</i>

01:13:07.096 --> 01:13:10.331
<i>And it was all good,
I don't regret a minute of it,</i>

01:13:10.431 --> 01:13:13.499
<i>but we forget our dreams at our peril.</i>

01:13:13.868 --> 01:13:18.875
<i>I know you had yours, too, and it must feel
sometimes like they're gone for good.</i>

01:13:18.975 --> 01:13:23.042
<i>But I'm so proud of the woman
you've become, Rosie,</i>

01:13:23.344 --> 01:13:25.945
<i>of the mother you've been to Katie.</i>

01:13:26.481 --> 01:13:29.233
<i>What I once said
about you is still true,</i>

01:13:29.333 --> 01:13:33.422
<i>there's nothing you can't do
if you put your mind to it.</i>

01:13:33.522 --> 01:13:37.325
<i>So keep chasing those dreams,
will you, darling?</i>

01:13:37.425 --> 01:13:39.286
<i>For my sake,</i>

01:13:39.642 --> 01:13:41.386
<i>Dad.</i>

01:13:52.307 --> 01:13:56.309
How can someone
just not be there anymore?

01:14:00.114 --> 01:14:01.247
Fuck knows.

01:14:06.888 --> 01:14:11.725
At least he did everything he wanted.
He didn't forget his dreams.

01:14:17.264 --> 01:14:19.765
What if I told you

01:14:19.867 --> 01:14:22.701
I was gonna use my share

01:14:23.004 --> 01:14:27.640
of the money from the house
and get myself a hotel?

01:14:28.309 --> 01:14:30.676
Somewhere simple but...

01:14:31.112 --> 01:14:33.379
But my own place.

01:14:34.315 --> 01:14:37.149
I think that would be awesome, Mom.

01:14:44.359 --> 01:14:48.696
<i>Rosie, I understand that you
haven't been in touch. And...</i>

01:14:48.796 --> 01:14:50.893
<i>I just need to know one thing.</i>

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.229
<i>Are you happy with him?</i>

01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:02.344
<i>There's not much I got right
in my life, but this family,</i>

01:15:02.444 --> 01:15:04.781
<i>somehow we're making it work.</i>

01:15:04.881 --> 01:15:08.363
<i>So I guess the one word answer
to your question should be,</i>

01:15:09.116 --> 01:15:10.683
<i>"Yes."</i>

01:15:18.593 --> 01:15:20.162
- Hey!
- Hi.

01:15:20.262 --> 01:15:22.465
So look at this. The Sweetlands Hotel.

01:15:22.565 --> 01:15:24.611
That's where we had our
end of school dance!

01:15:24.711 --> 01:15:27.770
They just joined our group. I mean,
I was just checking for discounts,

01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:30.369
and I found this booking...

01:15:31.305 --> 01:15:35.811
That's Greg's name!
The bridal suite, for this weekend!

01:15:35.911 --> 01:15:38.314
He's already up there on business.

01:15:38.414 --> 01:15:42.285
Do you think... For our anniversary?

01:15:45.286 --> 01:15:46.896
It's him.

01:15:50.124 --> 01:15:51.293
Hey!

01:15:51.393 --> 01:15:55.864
<i>Hey, gorgeous. Listen, I'm gonna
have to stay here a few extra nights,</i>

01:15:55.964 --> 01:15:58.700
<i>the guys need me to check out
some more venues.</i>

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.391
<i>Can you take Katie and go to your mom's,</i>

01:16:00.491 --> 01:16:03.336
<i>and then I can swing by
on Sunday and pick you up?</i>

01:16:04.772 --> 01:16:06.270
<i>Babe?</i>

01:16:07.274 --> 01:16:08.808
Fine.

01:16:09.010 --> 01:16:11.176
<i>Cool, see you later, then.</i>

01:16:11.412 --> 01:16:13.646
- Talk later.
<i>- Bye.</i>

01:16:17.118 --> 01:16:19.160
Check the booking.

01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:25.088
Here it is. Bridal suite for two,

01:16:25.188 --> 01:16:28.093
checked in two hours ago.

01:16:29.396 --> 01:16:31.364
Oh, Rosie, I'm...

01:16:51.048 --> 01:16:53.419
Rosie? What are you going to say?

01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:04.463
Fuck!

01:18:07.895 --> 01:18:09.513
"Rosie,

01:18:09.932 --> 01:18:13.435
"you deserve someone who loves you
with every beat of his heart.

01:18:13.535 --> 01:18:15.905
"Someone who will always
be there for you,

01:18:16.005 --> 01:18:19.107
"and who will love every part of you,
especially your flaws.

01:18:19.207 --> 01:18:23.753
<i>"I know Katie needs her dad. I don't
want to intrude. So if this is all wrong,</i>

01:18:23.853 --> 01:18:26.912
<i>"just ignore it and I promise
I'll never broach the subject again.</i>

01:18:28.015 --> 01:18:30.650
<i>"Greg's not the man for you, Rosie.</i>

01:18:30.985 --> 01:18:33.225
<i>"Twice I've let you
slip through my fingers.</i>

01:18:33.325 --> 01:18:36.091
<i>"Let's stop being afraid
and take the chance.</i>

01:18:36.191 --> 01:18:40.042
<i>"I know now I can make you happy.
Call me if you feel the same way.</i>

01:18:41.128 --> 01:18:42.862
<i>"Love, Alex."</i>

01:19:28.075 --> 01:19:29.463
Bethany?

01:19:30.244 --> 01:19:33.379
- What are you doing there?
- <i>I live here now. I moved in.</i>

01:19:34.982 --> 01:19:38.385
- <i>Look who it is, Mr. Schnuffs!</i>
- Mr. Schnuffs?

01:19:38.685 --> 01:19:40.319
<i>Rosie?</i>

01:19:49.561 --> 01:19:51.800
<i>Baby, that thing we were
talking about earlier.</i>

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:53.769
<i>- Yeah.
- Ask her now.</i>

01:19:53.869 --> 01:19:55.380
<i>Schnuffie...</i>

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.707
<i>Bethany and me,</i>

01:20:02.849 --> 01:20:05.180
<i>We thought, why hang around, you know,</i>

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.615
<i>So, she started organizing
the whole thing,</i>

01:20:08.715 --> 01:20:12.485
<i>but then Phil said no,
so your name came up, obviously.</i>

01:20:14.155 --> 01:20:15.921
<i>We're getting married!</i>

01:20:16.992 --> 01:20:19.694
<i>The wedding's next week.
It's fast, but we need to fit it in</i>

01:20:19.794 --> 01:20:23.832
<i>before New York Fashion Week.
And you have to be our best man!</i>

01:20:23.932 --> 01:20:25.835
<i>I mean, you are a girl but... Right?</i>

01:20:25.935 --> 01:20:28.704
<i>This is all because of you, Rosie.
You told me to come here.</i>

01:20:28.804 --> 01:20:32.204
<i>It wouldn't have happened if
it wasn't for you. Thank you.</i>

01:20:36.210 --> 01:20:38.680
It is so great having you as a friend.

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:41.383
I mean, every time something goes wrong
in my life, all I got to do is look at yours

01:20:41.483 --> 01:20:43.901
and it puts everything into perspective.

01:20:44.051 --> 01:20:46.541
He proposed to her on a boat.

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:50.292
It's like... It's like Kate and Leonardo
in that scene on the deck.

01:20:50.392 --> 01:20:52.344
The <i>Titanic.</i>

01:20:53.127 --> 01:20:55.178
How appropriate. Look,

01:20:55.278 --> 01:20:58.700
Alex is yours, he always has been.
This is just proof of ownership.

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:01.202
He wrote that months ago!

01:21:01.302 --> 01:21:04.337
- And anyway he's my best friend!
- No!

01:21:05.105 --> 01:21:07.840
I'm your best friend! Get it yet?

01:21:08.843 --> 01:21:10.476
We just keep missing each other.

01:21:12.279 --> 01:21:13.982
Maybe we're just not meant to be.

01:21:14.982 --> 01:21:17.811
Right. Let me just try and explain this
in a language you might understand.

01:21:19.054 --> 01:21:22.591
Ship. Iceberg. Ship hits iceberg.

01:21:22.691 --> 01:21:26.161
Mayhem, horror, ocean of ice

01:21:26.261 --> 01:21:29.064
and then Alex on the last lifeboat.

01:21:29.364 --> 01:21:31.248
One space left. Is it Bethany?

01:21:32.633 --> 01:21:34.615
Or Rosie?

01:21:35.636 --> 01:21:37.839
Who's it going to be?

01:21:41.054 --> 01:21:42.444
What? You're immigrating now?

01:21:42.544 --> 01:21:45.410
Less time, more outfits.
You're paying excess.

01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:46.583
What is this? A school outing?

01:21:46.683 --> 01:21:49.718
I couldn't leave her behind
and wherever Katie goes, Toby goes.

01:21:49.818 --> 01:21:51.887
Oh, are you two an item now?

01:21:51.987 --> 01:21:53.622
- No way. We're friends.
- No way. We're friends.

01:21:53.722 --> 01:21:56.178
God give me strength.
Well, come on, we're really late.

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:58.594
Relax. I hate arriving early,

01:21:58.694 --> 01:22:01.227
and besides, we have a five or six
hour cushion on the other side.

01:22:09.169 --> 01:22:10.939
- Sorry, what's going on?
- Volcanic ash.

01:22:11.039 --> 01:22:12.340
I need to go to Boston!

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.743
I'm afraid it's a five to six hour delay.
Sir, I understand...

01:22:15.843 --> 01:22:17.610
I think your cushion just burst.

01:22:26.621 --> 01:22:28.990
Slow down! I'm not wearing a sports bra!

01:22:29.190 --> 01:22:31.293
Okay, you guys, get your stuff!

01:22:31.393 --> 01:22:33.962
- Katie move it!
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

01:22:34.062 --> 01:22:37.062
- Ruby, come on!
- Mom!

01:22:40.067 --> 01:22:43.150
And you thought the flight was rough.
You'll have to get dressed in the van!

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:46.738
We are so late!

01:22:51.546 --> 01:22:53.982
- Excuse me?
- You get everything the wrong way round over here.

01:22:54.082 --> 01:22:55.684
- And you are?
- Ruby.

01:22:55.784 --> 01:22:57.919
- A pleasure to meet you, Ruby.
- Likewise.

01:22:58.019 --> 01:23:00.935
- Will you marry me?
- Yeah.

01:23:01.121 --> 01:23:03.676
What? That's not...
That's not fair! That's not...

01:23:03.776 --> 01:23:06.091
It can't be that easy, it's not...

01:23:17.238 --> 01:23:19.541
I think she wants all the women
around her to look fat.

01:23:19.641 --> 01:23:21.574
Well, it works.

01:23:35.690 --> 01:23:38.724
No, no, you don't know how hard it is.

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:04.987
Final word of warning. Alex can hold
his drink to an almost lethal degree,

01:24:05.087 --> 01:24:06.743
as I discovered on my 18th birthday,

01:24:06.843 --> 01:24:10.225
when he decided a night of
tequila slammers was the way to go.

01:24:12.327 --> 01:24:14.830
Well, you know when people say
that they were so drunk,

01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:19.000
that the whole night is a blank and you
always go, "No way, not possible."

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:23.001
Well, believe me, it's possible.

01:24:34.081 --> 01:24:36.163
Choosing a...

01:24:36.263 --> 01:24:40.252
Choosing the person that you
want to share your life with

01:24:40.988 --> 01:24:44.333
is one of the most important decisions

01:24:44.433 --> 01:24:46.625
any of us makes,

01:24:47.127 --> 01:24:48.692
ever.

01:24:50.164 --> 01:24:55.033
Because when it's wrong,
it turns your life to grey.

01:24:55.169 --> 01:24:59.841
And sometimes...
sometimes you don't even notice

01:24:59.941 --> 01:25:04.843
until you wake up one morning
and realize years have gone by.

01:25:06.113 --> 01:25:08.059
We both know about that one, Alex.

01:25:10.718 --> 01:25:13.217
Your friendship has brought

01:25:13.317 --> 01:25:16.041
glorious Technicolor to my life.

01:25:16.323 --> 01:25:19.393
It's been there even
in the darkest of times.

01:25:19.493 --> 01:25:23.128
And I am the luckiest
person alive for that gift.

01:25:25.332 --> 01:25:27.266
I hope I didn't take it for granted.

01:25:28.202 --> 01:25:32.874
I think maybe I did.
Because sometimes you don't see

01:25:32.974 --> 01:25:36.608
that the best thing that's ever
happened to you is sitting there,

01:25:36.708 --> 01:25:38.880
right under your nose.

01:25:39.913 --> 01:25:42.380
But that's fine, too.

01:25:42.883 --> 01:25:44.860
It really is.

01:25:45.185 --> 01:25:47.835
Because I've realized that...

01:25:49.389 --> 01:25:51.856
no matter where you are

01:25:52.659 --> 01:25:56.694
or what you're doing,
or who you're with,

01:25:57.831 --> 01:26:00.347
I will always

01:26:01.034 --> 01:26:03.067
honestly,

01:26:03.167 --> 01:26:06.860
truly, completely

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.754
love you.

01:26:24.725 --> 01:26:29.329
Like a sister loves a brother

01:26:29.429 --> 01:26:32.164
and a friend loves a friend.

01:26:33.767 --> 01:26:37.269
I'll always stand guard
over your dreams, Alex.

01:26:37.504 --> 01:26:41.940
No matter how weird or twisted they get.

01:26:46.413 --> 01:26:49.483
So, please, everybody,

01:26:49.583 --> 01:26:51.586
join me in a toast.

01:26:51.686 --> 01:26:54.617
To the bride and groom.

01:26:55.222 --> 01:26:58.056
To the bride and groom!

01:27:07.568 --> 01:27:11.873
- Come on, show me what you've got!
- No, please! Well, okay then! Ready?

01:27:11.973 --> 01:27:14.406
Here we go. You like it?

01:27:53.981 --> 01:27:56.714
Baby, what's up?

01:28:03.023 --> 01:28:04.802
Katie?

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.827
- Katie just...
- She just went through here.

01:28:09.663 --> 01:28:11.548
Katie?

01:28:11.648 --> 01:28:13.432
Mom?

01:28:14.602 --> 01:28:16.943
What are you doing out here?

01:28:22.342 --> 01:28:24.411
Toby kissed me, Mom.

01:28:26.313 --> 01:28:28.761
Is that such a bad thing?

01:28:29.249 --> 01:28:30.341
Of course it is.

01:28:32.252 --> 01:28:34.256
Hey. Look, I...

01:28:34.356 --> 01:28:37.517
I was watching you two tonight.
You're good together.

01:28:37.991 --> 01:28:39.827
You're a team.

01:28:39.927 --> 01:28:44.563
Don't you get it? It would be
like you two kissing or something.

01:28:44.999 --> 01:28:47.432
I'll just tell him
to forget the whole thing.

01:28:50.003 --> 01:28:52.020
Katie that...

01:28:52.439 --> 01:28:54.501
That would be a big mistake.

01:28:55.175 --> 01:28:59.581
Look, if you reject him now, he's gonna
make it his life's mission to go out there

01:28:59.681 --> 01:29:03.682
and meet the most perfect, beautiful girl
in the world just to try and get over you.

01:29:05.886 --> 01:29:08.590
And he'll end up
marrying this other woman

01:29:08.690 --> 01:29:11.559
and spending the rest
of his life with her.

01:29:11.659 --> 01:29:15.327
And you know, he'll tell himself
that she's perfect and...

01:29:17.997 --> 01:29:20.432
He really must be happy,

01:29:22.302 --> 01:29:25.337
but she won't be you, you know?

01:29:25.872 --> 01:29:28.809
But you two never actually kissed?

01:29:28.909 --> 01:29:30.475
- Did you?
- Of course not.

01:29:35.515 --> 01:29:38.553
- Katie?
- Toby!

01:29:38.853 --> 01:29:43.087
I'm really sorry.
Let's just pretend it never happened...

01:29:50.864 --> 01:29:52.731
Alex?

01:29:58.238 --> 01:30:03.408
I only realized,
tonight that you forgot.

01:30:06.713 --> 01:30:08.583
Your 18th birthday,

01:30:08.683 --> 01:30:12.751
about five tequila slammers in, I think,

01:30:14.321 --> 01:30:16.492
before you...

01:30:16.692 --> 01:30:18.827
fell off the stool...

01:30:22.429 --> 01:30:25.464
So that's why you took Bethany
to the dance.

01:30:30.904 --> 01:30:33.171
And you went with Greg.

01:30:39.646 --> 01:30:42.282
Well, bye.

01:30:42.942 --> 01:30:44.297
Okay.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:43.331
Cheers!

01:31:48.281 --> 01:31:50.248
It's so nice.

01:31:50.717 --> 01:31:54.453
Your own hotel, darling.
Your father would be so proud of you.

01:32:09.102 --> 01:32:12.371
Babe! Babe! We've got a visitor!

01:32:22.682 --> 01:32:24.127
Do you have a room?

01:32:25.218 --> 01:32:29.420
- Yes, of course.
- A single, for one night.

01:32:31.625 --> 01:32:35.093
Welcome! You are our first guest.

01:32:46.072 --> 01:32:48.340
Have we met before?

01:32:50.744 --> 01:32:55.347
The condom came off inside my vagina
and at present I'm unable to locate it!

01:32:58.852 --> 01:33:00.229
I don't think so.

01:33:00.855 --> 01:33:03.424
Ruby, would you please see
our guest upstairs to his room?

01:33:03.524 --> 01:33:06.191
- Of course.
- And free champagne!

01:33:06.693 --> 01:33:09.227
All right, follow me and then...

01:33:10.964 --> 01:33:15.102
Yeah, a brand new bed, and...
It's massive and you get to see the sea.

01:33:15.202 --> 01:33:18.803
And it's... It's really pretty.
You'll love it. You'll love it.

01:33:49.735 --> 01:33:50.691
Hi.

01:33:51.738 --> 01:33:53.571
Hi.

01:34:04.617 --> 01:34:06.153
Hey, guys!

01:34:06.253 --> 01:34:07.788
- No, I want to see him!
- Come on, out. No, out.

01:34:07.888 --> 01:34:10.656
- I said out! Come on, out, out, out!
- No, but I...

01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:20.232
So, I... I guess I need a room.

01:34:21.334 --> 01:34:23.301
Any baggage?

01:34:24.337 --> 01:34:25.955
No.

01:34:26.906 --> 01:34:28.240
I left it behind.

01:34:29.609 --> 01:34:30.842
So your wife...

01:34:31.945 --> 01:34:33.587
Won't be joining me.

01:34:36.383 --> 01:34:39.059
We both knew it wasn't right.

01:34:42.222 --> 01:34:46.758
Sea view or garden view?
I... recommend the sea.

01:34:50.396 --> 01:34:52.130
Sea it is.

01:34:54.033 --> 01:34:57.501
One room with sea view.

01:34:57.704 --> 01:35:02.510
Ruby would you mind showing our guest
upstairs to his room, please?

01:35:02.610 --> 01:35:06.845
Sorry, chief, but I'm really busy
doing the files right now.

01:35:10.784 --> 01:35:13.418
Please, follow me.

01:35:18.825 --> 01:35:22.830
So, I had this weird dream
on the plane over...

01:35:22.930 --> 01:35:25.232
Let me guess, you were
a clip on the seatbelts?

01:35:25.332 --> 01:35:29.485
No, I know, you were a valve in those
annoying fans that blow cold air on you?

01:35:29.585 --> 01:35:31.645
I can never turn those things off.

01:35:36.142 --> 01:35:37.809
No.

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:42.013
No.

01:35:45.084 --> 01:35:47.418
I was me.

01:35:48.321 --> 01:35:51.489
And you were you,

01:35:52.626 --> 01:35:56.247
standing where you are
right now, perfect.

01:35:59.599 --> 01:36:04.135
And I took you in my arms,
in a manly kind of way.

01:36:05.339 --> 01:36:07.105
Like this.

01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:09.707
And said,

01:36:12.245 --> 01:36:16.548
"Rosie Dunne,
can I take you to the dance?"

01:36:20.653 --> 01:36:22.867
Better late than never.
