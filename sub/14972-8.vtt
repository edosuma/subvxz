WEBVTT

00:03.104 --> 00:05.371
I got this female db and
when I checked her blood

00:05.373 --> 00:07.606
it was acting like
it was still alive.

00:07.608 --> 00:08.841
I am not supposed to talk
about it.

00:08.843 --> 00:09.725
Jesus, grace!

00:09.726 --> 00:10.608
I am your sister.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.111
It's classified.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.278
You are a traitor.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.513
I didn't know.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.782
( Fighting grunts )

00:16.784 --> 00:17.950
Now, you'll lead me
to the others.

00:17.952 --> 00:18.951
We got trouble.

00:18.953 --> 00:21.620
( Loud bellowing scream )
Aaargh!!!!!!

00:21.622 --> 00:24.023
( Gunfire )

00:25.459 --> 00:26.892
A vampire tooth.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.727
It must have been
what was poisoning her.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.697
Dmitri's death squad,
the "elite".

00:31.699 --> 00:33.866
Hand the woman to me!!!

00:33.868 --> 00:34.466
It's time to abandon ship.

00:37.872 --> 00:39.471
Guys! Guys! Guys!

00:39.473 --> 00:41.373
Wait for me!

01:18.913 --> 01:32.491
( Bird chirping )

01:37.264 --> 01:43.035
Pretty little thing, isn't she?

01:43.037 --> 01:48.273
Do you like this place?

01:48.275 --> 01:50.275
Um... it's been a long time

01:50.277 --> 01:54.346
since I slept in a bed
like that.

01:54.348 --> 01:58.217
Not since... before.

01:58.219 --> 02:01.620
It can be yours now.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.790
If you want.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.860
Your life can be good.

02:07.862 --> 02:11.029
Or not.

02:11.031 --> 02:14.700
Let me show you.

02:19.273 --> 02:31.316
( Screaming in pain )

02:31.318 --> 02:33.485
So many of them.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.786
Are they human?

02:34.788 --> 02:39.057
I mean, they look like it,
but-

02:39.059 --> 02:43.795
( screaming )

02:43.797 --> 02:45.130
Almost there.

02:45.132 --> 02:47.666
Stay with me!
Stay with me!!

02:47.668 --> 02:51.837
( Screaming )

02:51.839 --> 02:54.673
We ourselves cannot
give birth.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.141
( Screaming in pain )

02:56.143 --> 02:58.343
With a bite, I can give
centuries of life

02:58.345 --> 03:02.147
but I cannot create it.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.315
Not yet.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.149
Keep pushing!

03:04.151 --> 03:05.651
Bear down!

03:05.653 --> 03:10.122
( Screaming )

03:21.435 --> 03:27.005
We did...
Everything we could.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.441
Our calculations
must have been...

03:29.443 --> 03:31.743
( Growling )

03:31.745 --> 03:36.582
( Stuttering ) Please...
Please don't... please.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.416
Please.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.617
No.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.185
No, no!

03:40.187 --> 03:41.687
No!

03:41.689 --> 03:42.354
No!

03:42.356 --> 03:45.190
( Screaming )

03:45.192 --> 03:48.427
Please!

03:48.429 --> 03:51.263
What happens to the mother?

03:51.265 --> 03:57.970
Like the others, she
becomes a feedbag.

03:57.972 --> 04:01.373
I grow tired of your failures.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.175
( Groans )

04:03.177 --> 04:05.711
I'll try again.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.546
( Winces )

04:07.548 --> 04:10.115
I can learn from this.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.951
Please...

04:16.290 --> 04:18.690
( Gasps )

04:26.734 --> 04:33.238
You won't disappoint me
like that, will you?

04:33.240 --> 04:37.142
No. Never.

04:37.144 --> 04:45.784
Do my bidding or I'm sure
you'll make an excellent vessel.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.882
I'm just stating
the obvious, ok?

06:23.884 --> 06:26.318
It doesn't need to turn into
some big thing between us.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.154
It's a bit of a bitch when
you put it the way you do.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.555
What way?

06:30.557 --> 06:31.790
You mean the truth?

06:31.792 --> 06:34.292
Yeah, something like that.

06:34.294 --> 06:37.129
Look, it's pretty simple, ok?

06:37.131 --> 06:39.131
If we make it to the base
and it's still up and running

06:39.133 --> 06:42.567
I might not make it out alive.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.502
Who knows what
they wanted me for

06:43.504 --> 06:46.738
before you got stuck with me?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.106
Hell if I know.

06:48.107 --> 06:49.473
It's gotta be a cure though,
right?

06:49.476 --> 06:50.909
I mean, they had to think
that you were gonna help

06:50.911 --> 06:52.945
with this mess somehow
or they wouldn't have

06:52.946 --> 06:54.980
committed so much manpower
to keeping you alive.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.349
And I never felt "stuck"
with you,

06:57.351 --> 07:00.185
for what it's worth.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.554
Axel.

07:02.556 --> 07:05.157
You know what I'm saying.

07:05.159 --> 07:07.159
Yeah, I do.

07:07.161 --> 07:08.627
I hear you.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.901
( Laughing )

07:15.903 --> 07:19.805
( Coughing )

07:33.520 --> 07:35.187
( Peeing )

07:35.189 --> 07:38.690
( Laughing )

07:38.692 --> 07:40.926
( Bell tolls )

07:40.928 --> 07:43.195
What the hell was that?

07:43.197 --> 07:44.362
( Bell continues tolling )

07:44.364 --> 07:47.766
Bells, bells.

07:49.470 --> 07:53.038
( Peeing )

07:59.379 --> 08:01.213
What the hell?!

08:01.215 --> 08:02.113
( Chuckles )
Sorry, i-

08:02.115 --> 08:02.914
John?!

08:02.915 --> 08:03.714
Sorry, I...

08:03.717 --> 08:04.783
What, you're trying
to sneak a peek?

08:04.785 --> 08:05.695
No, no, no, no.

08:05.696 --> 08:06.606
I just wanted to do
what you're doing.

08:06.607 --> 08:07.517
I- I wouldn't...

08:07.521 --> 08:08.353
I don't mean
to be intrusive.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.722
I wouldn't do that.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.290
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

08:15.028 --> 08:18.597
Alright, well...

08:24.371 --> 08:26.204
( Exhales )

08:31.912 --> 08:33.311
It has to be something.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.480
They don't make that sound
on their own, they just don't.

08:35.482 --> 08:35.981
You ever heard of wind?

08:35.983 --> 08:36.782
Wind?!

08:36.783 --> 08:37.582
Does it feel like there's
a hurricane

08:37.584 --> 08:38.817
around here somewhere?

08:38.819 --> 08:41.152
A little wind isn't gonna
push around church bells.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.404
It's impossible.

08:42.405 --> 08:43.655
Shh, listen. Listen.

08:43.657 --> 08:46.992
( Bells continue to toll )

08:46.994 --> 08:48.827
Ok, so there's a church.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.395
And people are there.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.663
What good does that do us?

08:51.665 --> 08:52.831
It's other people.

08:52.832 --> 08:53.998
People we can make
contact with.

08:54.001 --> 08:54.666
Other people?

08:54.668 --> 08:56.902
Like people laying a trap.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.370
Our mission is
to get to the base,

08:58.371 --> 08:59.837
not wander around in the woods
looking for god knows what.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.123
From who?!

09:01.124 --> 09:02.407
Who gave you this mission?!

09:02.409 --> 09:04.576
I thought you were supposed to
be taking care of the hospital.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.311
You're supposed to be taking
care of these two-

09:06.313 --> 09:07.412
I'm a marine, asshole.

09:07.414 --> 09:08.747
I know what I'm supposed
to do.

09:08.749 --> 09:09.848
You're making shit up
as you go-

09:09.850 --> 09:11.216
once we evacuated the hospital!

09:11.217 --> 09:12.583
It got overrun,
we almost died.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.136
Yeah, whatever.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.687
Ok, I need to get this woman
to the base.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.088
This is my vehicle,
that's what I'm gonna do.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.490
How do we know that the base
is still there?

09:18.492 --> 09:19.824
I mean, how do we know?

09:19.826 --> 09:21.826
Look, if we get there
and there's no one

09:21.828 --> 09:23.995
then we can go chasing
church bells.

09:23.997 --> 09:24.846
Ok?

09:24.847 --> 09:25.696
It'll be great.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.481
Fine.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.264
It doesn't matter.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.368
What do you think, Vanessa?

09:30.370 --> 09:32.704
( Sighs )

09:32.705 --> 09:35.039
I think we need to make
a decision.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.842
What about a vote?

09:37.844 --> 09:39.444
Well, if my vote means
anything my sister used to work

09:39.446 --> 09:41.880
at the base as well.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.048
I'm pretty sure she's the one
who sent you in to begin with.

09:43.050 --> 09:47.786
Wait, your sister sent
the marines?

09:47.788 --> 09:49.020
Something like that.

09:49.022 --> 09:53.258
As soon as I told her
about you, yes.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.297
I say we go there.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.432
Check it out.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.301
I thought we were putting it
to a vote?

10:03.303 --> 10:04.703
( Chuckles )

10:04.704 --> 10:06.104
End of discussion, I guess.

10:30.664 --> 10:38.269
( Low growling )

10:38.271 --> 10:40.505
( Gun shot )

11:00.527 --> 11:03.662
Is this it?

11:03.664 --> 11:06.264
Yeah.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.932
Now what?

11:07.934 --> 11:09.100
Now we walk.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.535
Walk?

11:10.537 --> 11:11.703
Why the hell would we walk?

11:11.705 --> 11:12.604
We've got no choice.

11:12.605 --> 11:13.504
Does it look like Juan
is gonna make it

11:13.507 --> 11:14.506
through that mess up there?

11:14.508 --> 11:15.273
Why would we get out of
the vehicle?

11:15.275 --> 11:16.274
We got a perfectly good-

11:16.276 --> 11:17.609
this isn't a military vehicle.

11:17.611 --> 11:18.543
She's not gonna get through
that shit out there.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.111
We gotta protect her
for later.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.013
Come on, people. Let's go.

11:54.648 --> 11:56.214
You ok?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.248
I'll make it.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.317
It's about a half mile
to the base.

11:59.319 --> 12:02.554
Everybody stick close,
watch each other's six.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.559
Get down!

12:08.895 --> 12:10.128
( Gun fire )

12:10.130 --> 12:11.896
( Explosion )

12:14.000 --> 12:15.467
What the hell was that?

12:15.469 --> 12:16.634
Land mines.

12:16.636 --> 12:17.485
Great.

12:17.486 --> 12:18.335
Must have been some kind of
last ditch effort

12:18.338 --> 12:19.904
to protect the place.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.239
We never had land mines
around the perimeter before.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.408
( Distant gun shot )

12:23.410 --> 12:25.076
We need to move.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.812
Copy that. Better get to
the base, hope for the best.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.080
We could have stayed inside
the vehicle,

12:29.082 --> 12:30.682
hunkered down and
waited like I said.

12:30.684 --> 12:32.917
And then what?

12:32.919 --> 12:33.918
Or we could
keep walking.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.253
Well, unless you sprouted
wings

12:35.255 --> 12:37.122
reading that Jesus
book of yours,

12:37.123 --> 12:38.990
walking is the best way in,
big guy.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.584
Are you serious?

13:10.690 --> 13:14.092
You've got to be kidding me?

13:24.304 --> 13:35.947
( Bells toll in the distance )

13:48.228 --> 13:52.096
( Explosion in the distance )

14:02.475 --> 14:04.776
Split up I guess, i
will stay with you.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.613
Stay close,
boys and girls.

15:15.615 --> 15:21.119
This is gonna have to be
home tonight.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.121
How you doin', old girl?

15:23.123 --> 15:25.356
I missed you.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.874
Hey.

15:42.876 --> 15:44.742
It's the best one I could
find.

15:44.744 --> 15:45.476
Thank you.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.378
Need anything else?

15:47.380 --> 15:48.746
No.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.481
There's not much in the way
of food

15:50.482 --> 15:52.215
but I got one of those little
fruit cocktail thingies.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.818
It's got the cherries in it.

15:53.820 --> 15:54.502
No.

15:54.503 --> 15:55.185
The good kind.

15:55.186 --> 15:55.868
No, it's ok.

15:55.869 --> 15:56.551
I mean, with the others,

15:56.556 --> 15:57.722
I don't want to eat a whole
can by myself.

15:57.723 --> 15:58.889
I'm just saying if you twisted
my rubber arm

15:58.892 --> 16:01.559
I might share it with you,
that's all.

16:01.561 --> 16:04.128
Maybe later.

16:17.243 --> 16:18.343
How's it look?

16:18.345 --> 16:21.145
Good.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.747
Like the old you.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.082
I look old?

16:24.084 --> 16:25.350
( Laughs )

16:25.352 --> 16:27.318
Shut up!

16:30.857 --> 16:32.657
Let me see those.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.779
Alright, y'all.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.415
I got first watch.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.018
G'night, Van.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.956
Who am I kiddin'?

17:04.958 --> 17:08.259
I got all the goddamn watches.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.097
( Explosion outside )

17:13.099 --> 17:14.799
What the hell was that?

17:14.801 --> 17:16.034
You know what it was.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.035
( Cocks gun )

17:18.471 --> 17:21.439
Ok, ok, ok.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.444
( Explosion outside )

18:12.292 --> 18:14.625
Yeah, but there's no bodies
up here.

18:14.627 --> 18:15.793
That we can see, anyway.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.428
No fires, nothin'.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.530
So what does that mean?

18:19.532 --> 18:21.532
So there's nothing to suggest
the place was overrun

18:21.534 --> 18:25.036
or whatever so what
the hell happened to everybody?

18:25.038 --> 18:26.037
What does it matter?

18:26.039 --> 18:28.606
There's nobody here.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.474
I'm just sayin'.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.309
Saying what?

18:31.311 --> 18:32.977
Say it.

18:32.979 --> 18:33.811
Nothing.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.146
Exactly.

18:35.148 --> 18:39.217
Maybe they'll be back.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.952
Why would you think that?

18:40.954 --> 18:43.121
I don't know, maybe they're
off fighting somewhere

18:43.123 --> 18:44.689
and then they'll come back
eventually.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.390
Surely they would leave
somebody here

18:46.392 --> 18:48.459
if that were the case, right?

18:48.461 --> 18:51.062
Not necessarily.

18:51.064 --> 18:52.130
Well, why wouldn't they?

18:52.132 --> 18:54.298
With all this stuff here?

18:54.300 --> 18:56.300
Of course they would.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.406
People died here,
i can feel it.

19:02.408 --> 19:05.977
Oh, that's great. Thanks.

19:05.979 --> 19:09.213
You win the creepy story
of the morning award.

19:09.215 --> 19:10.231
Don't turn away, John.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.248
If you have something to say
then why don't you say it

19:11.251 --> 19:12.817
to my face?

19:12.819 --> 19:13.584
You're creepy.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.887
( Laughs )

19:15.889 --> 19:19.390
( Laughing )

19:21.828 --> 19:24.328
( Door opens )

19:26.232 --> 19:28.332
Hey, hey.

19:28.334 --> 19:31.002
Where you been?

19:31.004 --> 19:36.107
Oh, you know, the few,
the proud, the insomniacs.

19:36.109 --> 19:37.575
Checking the perimeter,
seeing what's what.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.294
Anything?

19:39.295 --> 19:41.012
Not yet, just did the
outside tour though.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.346
Still got the building
to take care of.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.415
Alright, we should spread
out and do it in pairs.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.783
It'll be faster that way.

19:45.785 --> 19:46.918
Yeah, alright.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.052
As long as you
stick together.

19:48.053 --> 19:49.186
I'm still good doing
my own thing.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.521
Susan, you go with John.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.590
Doc, you're with me.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.944
This is my sister's office.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.381
( Coughing )

20:17.383 --> 20:19.884
Oh... Jesus.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.153
What the...

20:22.155 --> 20:24.889
This is not what
i was expecting.

20:24.891 --> 20:29.994
Whenever we would Skype it
was always from this direction.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.629
So this sister of yours...

20:31.631 --> 20:32.513
Grace.

20:32.514 --> 20:33.396
Grace, right.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.565
What does she do, exactly?

20:34.567 --> 20:37.468
I'm not entirely sure anymore.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.303
Take a guess.

20:39.305 --> 20:40.938
Research for the military.

20:40.939 --> 20:42.572
Some sort of experimental
program.

20:42.575 --> 20:47.144
She didn't talk much
about it.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.930
But you told her about me.

20:48.931 --> 20:50.715
Well, I sent in your blood work,
she got all weird,

20:50.717 --> 20:53.918
next thing I knew
the cavalry arrived.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.820
She did say something
about an advisory coming in

20:55.822 --> 20:57.722
from the Pentagon?

21:03.997 --> 21:06.731
Something about this, it-
it doesn't add up.

21:10.003 --> 21:12.169
Oh my god.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.741
I gave this to her.

21:18.511 --> 21:21.779
Funny how a little thing
like this survives.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.749
( Sighs )

21:26.619 --> 21:29.520
Unidentified female, Seattle
valley general hospital.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.354
This must be me.

21:30.356 --> 21:32.290
Yeah, I sent that in.

21:32.292 --> 21:33.658
That's your blood work.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.264
This is my file.

21:41.434 --> 21:45.369
It's empty.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.605
File 281: The farm.

21:47.607 --> 21:50.041
Did your sister every say
anything to you about the farm?

21:50.043 --> 21:51.442
No.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.778
I'm sorry, I wish I knew more.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.613
( Explosion outside )

21:55.615 --> 21:57.214
We gotta go.

21:57.216 --> 21:58.683
Now.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.693
( Explosion )

22:12.965 --> 22:14.865
Clear.

22:21.908 --> 22:24.542
( Explosion )

22:24.544 --> 22:27.478
They're getting closer.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.814
Shit.

22:32.552 --> 22:35.052
Clear.

22:39.058 --> 22:42.393
( Clattering )

22:50.169 --> 22:52.803
( Whispering )
Down there.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.139
You go.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.741
You go! You got the gun.

22:56.743 --> 22:59.710
Come on.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.163
Jesus Christ!

23:19.599 --> 23:21.432
Don't move!

23:24.036 --> 23:26.036
Open the door.

23:26.038 --> 23:28.339
Now!

23:35.681 --> 23:37.681
( Stammering ) No, not- not
Norman, it's gorman.

23:37.683 --> 23:40.418
( Slams floor with bat )

23:40.420 --> 23:42.086
With a g.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.687
Is that your first name or
your last name?

23:43.689 --> 23:45.423
( Stammering ) Uh, first.

23:45.425 --> 23:47.591
Uh... Jones is my last.

23:47.593 --> 23:52.363
Gorman Jones, tell us again
what you're doing here.

23:52.365 --> 23:56.600
Like I said before, I got
separated with my group

23:56.602 --> 23:59.203
and, you know, we got in a fight

23:59.205 --> 24:01.272
with some of them
mother suckers.

24:01.274 --> 24:02.706
Is that your name for vampires?

24:02.708 --> 24:04.175
( Laughs )
Yeah.

24:04.177 --> 24:06.277
Yeah, you know, some people
look at me funny

24:06.279 --> 24:08.779
when I say it, but the shoe fit.

24:08.781 --> 24:09.780
Look, you can call 'em
whatever you want.

24:09.782 --> 24:13.717
Your group, who are they?

24:13.719 --> 24:16.554
The resistance.

24:16.556 --> 24:18.722
Part of it, anyhow.

24:18.724 --> 24:19.457
The resistance?

24:19.459 --> 24:20.291
Mmmhmm.

24:20.293 --> 24:21.892
That's a real thing?

24:21.894 --> 24:23.678
That's not just a bunch of
country boys running around

24:23.679 --> 24:25.463
in the woods with some guns
playing soldier?

24:25.465 --> 24:26.964
Nope.

24:26.966 --> 24:27.765
Yeah, no.

24:27.766 --> 24:28.565
It's a real thing.

24:28.568 --> 24:29.900
Where's your group based?

24:29.902 --> 24:31.469
And do you know what
happened here?

24:31.471 --> 24:32.770
( Sighs )

24:32.771 --> 24:34.070
We got split up at
night and...

24:34.073 --> 24:35.406
During the shootin',

24:35.408 --> 24:37.475
lit up the night with
those uh... tracer fire...

24:37.477 --> 24:38.809
I'm pretty sure we saw that.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.428
Mmmhmm.

24:40.429 --> 24:42.046
Well, yeah, I got- I got
outta the woods

24:42.048 --> 24:44.882
and saw the buildings here...

24:44.884 --> 24:47.051
I wasn't sure about
this place but i-

24:47.053 --> 24:49.954
I hid out here when I heard you
guys comin'.

24:59.232 --> 25:01.065
So what do you guys think?

25:01.067 --> 25:02.967
He's another mouth to feed.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.301
He looks like a meat
eater to me.

25:04.303 --> 25:05.669
I'm just sayin'.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.471
Does he look like a vegan
to you?

25:07.473 --> 25:09.807
For once I agree with John.

25:09.809 --> 25:10.975
Me too.

25:10.976 --> 25:12.142
We barely have enough
to go around.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.410
Yeah, well we can't send
the guy away

25:13.412 --> 25:14.311
because he's hungry, ok?

25:14.313 --> 25:16.714
We're gonna have to deal
with it.

25:18.651 --> 25:21.151
( Explosion )

25:21.153 --> 25:22.419
That one seemed close.

25:22.421 --> 25:25.089
It sounded like it was
inside the fences.

25:25.091 --> 25:26.591
Yeah, well it's just
a matter of time.

25:26.592 --> 25:28.092
They're attracted by the
sound of the explosions.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.527
We need to prepare.

25:29.529 --> 25:30.261
Windows, doors-

25:30.263 --> 25:31.407
no, no, no.

25:31.408 --> 25:32.552
We're not doing that again.

25:32.553 --> 25:33.697
We're not- no more booby
traps and that shit.

25:33.699 --> 25:34.431
We can't defend this place.

25:34.433 --> 25:35.599
Why not?

25:35.601 --> 25:37.101
I used to live here.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.853
Look around.

25:38.854 --> 25:40.604
We're on the ground floor,
there's four entrances,

25:40.606 --> 25:42.673
there's a garage door,
there's a hundred windows...

25:42.675 --> 25:45.442
Then what do you suggest?

25:45.444 --> 25:46.677
What about the church bells?

25:46.679 --> 25:47.845
Hell yeah, why not?

25:47.847 --> 25:49.179
It's worth a try.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.514
Sleep here tonight, go back
to the vehicle in the morning,

25:50.516 --> 25:51.682
get the hell outta here.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.284
It doesn't matter.

25:53.286 --> 25:55.853
They'll keep coming for us.

25:55.855 --> 25:57.521
Julius, Dmitri, Rebecca.

25:57.523 --> 25:58.823
It's inevitable.

25:58.824 --> 26:00.124
Yeah, well at some point we
might be able to bring

26:00.126 --> 26:01.036
the fight to them.

26:01.037 --> 26:01.947
But in the meantime-

26:01.948 --> 26:02.858
it's all the more reason to
find these other people

26:02.862 --> 26:05.095
and hook up with the resistance.

26:05.097 --> 26:07.031
Maybe it's time to split up.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.133
If we all go different ways then
they can't follow all of us.

26:09.135 --> 26:09.600
No!

26:09.602 --> 26:10.601
No, no.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.202
We're not splitting up.

26:12.204 --> 26:15.372
We stick together, we find
some place that we can fortify,

26:15.374 --> 26:17.541
we hunker down, we
ride this thing out.

26:17.543 --> 26:20.144
Says you, Axel!

26:20.146 --> 26:22.112
What was that, doc?

26:22.114 --> 26:23.881
You don't think these people
look like they could use a rest?

26:23.883 --> 26:25.382
I'm just saying maybe
that's not

26:25.384 --> 26:26.717
what everybody wants right now.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.218
Maybe some of us have other
ideas as to what we wanna do

26:28.220 --> 26:30.788
with our lives right now.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.506
Such as?

26:32.507 --> 26:34.223
I don't- I'm just saying!

26:34.226 --> 26:35.826
Look, I'm just trying to keep
you people safe,

26:35.828 --> 26:37.795
and that includes you, doc.

26:37.797 --> 26:40.197
Until we know where we're
going or what we're doing,

26:40.199 --> 26:43.300
we can at least agree to hunker
down someplace

26:43.302 --> 26:45.469
for a couple of days, yeah?

26:45.471 --> 26:48.872
Then what do you suggest?

26:48.874 --> 26:52.076
You got a bomb shelter
in your back pocket?

26:52.078 --> 26:52.910
Yeah.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.779
Maybe I do.

27:11.330 --> 27:14.898
( Hissing )

27:14.900 --> 27:16.500
( Growling )

27:24.010 --> 27:25.476
( Hissing )

27:34.186 --> 27:35.919
( Hissing )

27:36.789 --> 27:45.496
( Fighting grunts )

28:12.124 --> 28:13.791
Don't take everything out of
the vehicle just yet

28:13.793 --> 28:15.125
until we scope this place out.

28:15.127 --> 28:18.562
Just the essentials.

28:18.564 --> 28:20.064
This is where we're supposed
to hold up

28:20.066 --> 28:21.231
and stay safe for a few days?

28:21.233 --> 28:21.865
Come on.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.167
Yes sir.

28:23.168 --> 28:24.468
We're gonna need a bigger
bunker for starters.

28:24.470 --> 28:25.302
Very funny, asshole.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.970
It's underground.

28:26.972 --> 28:28.172
They call this place
"the farm",

28:28.173 --> 28:29.373
I guess 'cause it's in
the middle of the field.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.874
That's just the entrance.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.476
The farm?

28:32.478 --> 28:34.745
What was it?

28:34.747 --> 28:36.063
A research facility,
something like that.

28:36.064 --> 28:37.380
We used to drop off supplies.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.083
Other than that it was
off limits.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.017
What was it, really?

28:40.018 --> 28:40.950
I don't know, doc.

28:40.953 --> 28:44.054
It was scientists and higher
ups, people above my pay grade.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.056
Are we gonna do this or not?

28:46.057 --> 28:48.057
Looks like a mausoleum to me but
I'll do what everyone decides.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.660
I say we go.

28:49.662 --> 28:51.495
Why doesn't it feel safe in
the basement to me, Axel?

28:51.497 --> 28:52.896
Why is that?

28:52.898 --> 28:54.365
Son of a bitch!

28:54.366 --> 28:55.833
Probably because you're a
dip shit that likes to spout off

28:55.835 --> 28:58.902
about things you don't
know the first thing about!

28:58.904 --> 29:01.371
Well, I think I got
the door fixed.

29:02.675 --> 29:03.841
Back up.

29:03.843 --> 29:04.908
Woah!

29:06.345 --> 29:07.478
Jesus!

29:08.147 --> 29:09.379
Ok.

29:11.851 --> 29:12.716
It's goin' there.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.836
Ok.

29:32.838 --> 29:35.105
Yeah, well I got a...

29:35.107 --> 29:37.941
I got a spare right here.

29:39.779 --> 29:46.350
( Explosion )

29:46.519 --> 29:54.091
( Coughing )

30:02.468 --> 30:05.068
Emergency power's still up.

30:05.070 --> 30:06.904
Yeah, well this place
doubles as a fall-out shelter.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.240
Clear.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.575
You mean like uh, tornadoes
and uh, shit?

30:11.577 --> 30:13.644
Yeah, like tornadoes and shit.

30:13.646 --> 30:17.815
( Loud thunderous sound )

30:17.817 --> 30:20.417
What was that?

30:20.419 --> 30:25.322
( Loud thunderous collapse)

30:25.324 --> 30:27.758
Woah, woah, woah!

30:27.760 --> 30:29.159
We're not getting back
through that door.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.994
Well, that's inconvenient.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.279
Why's that?

30:32.280 --> 30:33.563
'Cause this is the only way
in or out of this place.

30:33.566 --> 30:34.598
Oh, Jesus.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.900
So much for a few days' rest.

30:36.902 --> 30:39.636
Like I said, mausoleum.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.041

30:46.912 --> 30:48.145

30:48.147 --> 30:50.714

31:20.779 --> 31:21.378
Alright, everybody have
a look around.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.348
See what you can find.

32:02.054 --> 32:03.954
Hey, you guys, get in here!

32:03.956 --> 32:07.057

32:07.059 --> 32:09.559
Look at all this stuff.

32:09.561 --> 32:10.994

32:10.996 --> 32:12.062

32:12.064 --> 32:13.897

32:13.899 --> 32:14.665
Not just beans.

32:14.667 --> 32:15.616
What?

32:15.617 --> 32:16.566
Holy crap, look at it all!

32:16.568 --> 32:18.001

32:18.003 --> 32:20.470

33:07.686 --> 33:10.287

do in here?

33:31.377 --> 33:32.709
We salute you.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.211
( All ): To the fallen.

33:34.213 --> 33:35.445
To the fallen.

33:35.447 --> 33:36.380
And the living.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.281
That as well.

33:55.501 --> 34:05.609

34:05.611 --> 34:16.420

34:16.422 --> 34:18.422

34:41.747 --> 34:42.512
Whoo!

34:53.859 --> 34:57.360
I'm gonna find you.

34:57.362 --> 35:00.697
No matter what it takes.

35:13.545 --> 35:14.611
I'll uh- I'll take
some of that stew

35:14.613 --> 35:16.379
if you're done
with it there.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.953
It's all you, buddy.

35:25.891 --> 35:27.057
Thanks, pal.

35:27.059 --> 35:28.058
What's up, doc?

35:28.060 --> 35:30.894
Please, just go away.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.697
Ok?

35:33.699 --> 35:34.865
It's- it's not you!

35:34.867 --> 35:36.199
Whatever!

36:30.489 --> 36:32.656
The guess who
isn't American.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.257
Yes they were.

36:34.259 --> 36:35.192
They wrote that song
American woman.

36:35.194 --> 36:36.927
It doesn't matter.

36:36.929 --> 36:37.527
It doesn't matter.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.851
Really?

36:38.852 --> 36:40.174
Nope.

36:40.175 --> 36:41.497
But neither is rush, bachman
Turner overdrive-

36:41.500 --> 36:42.199
no.

36:42.201 --> 36:43.433
Bryan Adams...

36:43.435 --> 36:44.184
Yeah.

36:44.185 --> 36:44.934
Loverboy...

36:44.937 --> 36:46.270
Bullshit.

36:46.271 --> 36:47.604
No, loverboy is American.

36:47.606 --> 36:50.840
Loverboy- loverboy is not
an American band.

36:50.842 --> 36:54.611
Loverboy- loverboy
is my favourite band.

36:54.613 --> 36:55.529
That's impossible.

36:55.530 --> 36:56.446
Loverboy isn't
anybody's favourite band.

36:56.448 --> 36:57.347
Well, it's true,
they're mine.

36:57.349 --> 36:58.782
No.

36:58.784 --> 36:59.950
Yeah.

36:59.952 --> 37:01.284
They're my favourite
band ever.

37:01.286 --> 37:03.887
Well, they're a Canadian band.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.956
Fine, you win.

37:05.958 --> 37:06.790
Whatever.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.391
Oh, god.

37:08.393 --> 37:11.127
Don't be a sore loser.

37:11.129 --> 37:13.363
( Laughs )

37:13.365 --> 37:14.948
No, I'm not a loser.

37:14.949 --> 37:16.532
No, you're the opposite
of a loser.

37:16.535 --> 37:18.401
That's what I meant.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.036
( Giggles )

37:20.038 --> 37:21.204
That's nice.

37:21.206 --> 37:27.777
( Laughing )

37:31.883 --> 37:34.951
Hmm?

37:38.223 --> 37:40.991
No, no.

37:40.993 --> 37:43.994
No, no.

37:43.996 --> 37:44.978
Stop.

37:44.979 --> 37:45.961
Stop!

37:45.964 --> 37:48.298
Get off me, please!

37:48.300 --> 37:51.468
( Slap )

37:51.470 --> 37:57.574
( Struggling )

37:57.576 --> 38:02.746
( Starts screaming )

38:02.748 --> 38:03.980
What was that?

38:03.982 --> 38:04.815
( Screaming continues )

38:04.816 --> 38:05.649
Vanessa!!

38:06.752 --> 38:10.520
( Screaming continues )

38:10.522 --> 38:12.422
Be quiet!

38:12.424 --> 38:13.923
What the hell's going on
here, huh?!

38:13.925 --> 38:14.591
Relax!

38:14.593 --> 38:16.259
Relax, people.

38:16.261 --> 38:17.494
We were laughing
and then kissing-

38:17.496 --> 38:18.662
she kissed me-

38:18.664 --> 38:19.362
she was
kissing me-

38:19.364 --> 38:20.141
no, no, no-

38:20.142 --> 38:20.919
yes, you did too!

38:20.920 --> 38:21.697
She kissed me!

38:21.700 --> 38:22.644
No, that's not true!

38:22.645 --> 38:23.589
Yes, you did!

38:23.590 --> 38:24.534
We were just- I was-
and then you wouldn't-

38:24.536 --> 38:25.268
you wouldn't let go of me!

38:25.270 --> 38:26.936
You wanted me to!

38:26.938 --> 38:28.438
Let go of me, bitch!

38:31.243 --> 38:34.244
Don't call me "bitch",
bitch.

38:48.427 --> 38:49.893
Now what're we supposed to do?

38:49.895 --> 38:51.494
I don't know.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.563
I'd start with castration but
I'm probably in the minority.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.265
Come on, you gotta
be kidding me.

38:55.267 --> 38:57.000
Normally we'd kick you
out but the new guy blew

38:57.002 --> 38:58.268
out the front door.

38:58.270 --> 38:58.835
Kick me out for what?

38:58.837 --> 38:59.636
What did I do?

38:59.637 --> 39:00.436
Sounds good to me.

39:00.439 --> 39:01.021
Oh, god.

39:01.022 --> 39:01.604
Here we go again!

39:01.606 --> 39:02.505
Again?

39:02.507 --> 39:04.107
What are you guys
talking about?

39:04.109 --> 39:04.841
Just stay out of this.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.109
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

39:06.111 --> 39:07.010
Look at her neck.

39:07.012 --> 39:08.345
What?

39:08.347 --> 39:10.047
The marks on her neck.

39:10.048 --> 39:11.748
What're you talking about?

39:11.749 --> 39:13.449
Roger, Cynthia, the way
they were killed.

39:13.452 --> 39:14.517
What're you saying, doc?

39:14.519 --> 39:16.920
That he's the killer.

39:16.922 --> 39:18.788
Are you crazy?

39:18.790 --> 39:19.956
What the hell's going
on here?

39:19.958 --> 39:20.790
Seriously?

39:20.792 --> 39:21.424
No, think about it, people.

39:21.426 --> 39:23.693
Think about it!

39:23.695 --> 39:24.861
I am thinking about it.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.029
He was always accusing
everybody else.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.365
It was always somebody else.

39:28.367 --> 39:29.966
Either me or, or flesh-

39:29.968 --> 39:31.835
and then mohamad.

39:31.836 --> 39:33.703
That's 'cause mohamad's
the one who was doing it.

39:33.705 --> 39:34.104
Are you guys
completely nuts?

39:34.106 --> 39:35.038
Stop this.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.040
Ok? Stop it, now.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.209
And you sided with Brendan!

39:39.211 --> 39:40.377
You tried to get all of
us killed.

39:40.379 --> 39:41.878
No!

39:41.880 --> 39:42.779
Jesus Christ!

39:42.781 --> 39:44.481
I was trying to kiss her!

39:44.483 --> 39:45.816
I was drunk!

39:45.817 --> 39:47.150
Your hands were around her
throat when I got there, John!

39:47.152 --> 39:49.719
Yeah, I was trying to stop
her from screaming, that's all!

39:49.721 --> 39:53.656
That wasn't me trying to...

39:53.658 --> 39:55.892
Trying to what?

39:55.894 --> 39:57.060
Kill her!

39:57.062 --> 39:57.994
Trying to kill her!

39:57.996 --> 39:59.496
I don't want to kill anybody!

39:59.498 --> 40:03.066
You tried to kill me
a couple of times.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.468
That's different.

40:05.470 --> 40:06.903
How?

40:06.905 --> 40:08.638
How is that different, John?

40:12.911 --> 40:16.146
Wanna get his bag?

40:27.926 --> 40:29.692
What the- you can't just-

40:29.694 --> 40:31.394
looky here.

40:31.396 --> 40:33.163
You've seen that before,
so what?

40:33.165 --> 40:34.431
It's from the kitchen
at the hospital.

40:34.433 --> 40:35.832
I recognize the handle.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.600
Yeah, there's a reason
for that.

40:37.602 --> 40:38.768
I don't think I need
to explain it.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.271
This is the same kind of
blade that killed Roger.

40:41.273 --> 40:42.739
Serrated edge, slanted tip.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.040
Bullshit!

40:44.041 --> 40:45.340
Look, I took that from
the kitchen for protection!

40:45.343 --> 40:47.177
That's it!

40:50.282 --> 40:51.347
Oh!!

40:51.349 --> 40:52.348
What the hell?!

40:52.350 --> 40:53.783
It looks like Cynthia's finger.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.251
I think that pretty much
settles it.

40:55.253 --> 40:56.019
Bullshit!

40:56.021 --> 40:56.853
That's not mine!

40:56.855 --> 40:58.855
All this time it was you, John?

40:58.857 --> 41:00.757
All this time it was you?!

41:00.759 --> 41:02.292
You blame everybody else,
you blamed mohamad,

41:02.294 --> 41:02.692
you blamed me...

41:02.694 --> 41:04.360
What's-

41:04.362 --> 41:06.196
Axel, think about this.

41:06.198 --> 41:08.264

Let her go.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.607

41:17.609 --> 41:19.042
Don't make me do this!

41:19.044 --> 41:20.210
Let her go!

41:20.212 --> 41:21.878
Drop the gun now!!!!

41:21.880 --> 41:22.401
Let her go!

41:22.402 --> 41:22.923
Let her go!

41:22.924 --> 41:23.445
Drop it!

41:23.448 --> 41:24.164
Please don't do this-

41:24.165 --> 41:24.881
shut up!

41:26.151 --> 41:27.784

you going to go?!!!
