00:10.271 --> 00:13.404
<i>Robert Frost says
fences make good neighbors.</i>

00:13.448 --> 00:15.015
But, in this case,

00:15.058 --> 00:18.018
we have to ask,
do neighbors make good fences?

00:18.061 --> 00:22.022
<i>My Uncle Irving happened to have
a fence and sign business.</i>

00:22.065 --> 00:24.067
<i>I shudder to think
what he would have thought</i>

00:24.111 --> 00:26.678
<i>-of this chain-link monstrosity.
Come on, come on. Up.</i>

00:26.722 --> 00:28.463
-Up, up, up, up, up. <i>
-Okay.</i>

00:28.506 --> 00:30.073
Who's playing?

00:30.117 --> 00:32.075
Oh, hey. Nobody.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.772
That's the focus group.

00:33.816 --> 00:35.948
-It's your guy, Wackner.

00:35.992 --> 00:38.647
-Mm.
-Must not be going well
if you're calling him my guy.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.693
Why aren't you there in person?

00:41.737 --> 00:43.695
It is in Vegas.

00:43.739 --> 00:46.394
-You know,
where the real Americans live.

00:46.437 --> 00:49.266
<i>♪ You do the hokey pokey and you
turn yourself around♪ Turn!</i>

00:49.310 --> 00:51.442
-♪ <i>That's what it's all about</i>♪
What do all those X's mean?

00:51.486 --> 00:53.270
Those X's are
all the people that said

00:53.314 --> 00:55.098
they would, uh,
change the channel.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.969
-♪ <i>And you shake it all about</i>♪
-Ouch.

00:57.013 --> 00:58.623
That's a lot of X's.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's a lot of X's.

01:00.973 --> 01:02.758
But it's just the first cut.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.412
Now the Q&A begins.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.109
<i>So, pretty fun stuff.</i>

01:06.153 --> 01:07.980
Uh, so on a scale
from one to five,

01:08.024 --> 01:10.461
how would you rate your level of
excitement for <i>Wackner Rules?</i>

01:10.505 --> 01:11.897
Use your dials.

01:11.941 --> 01:13.725
Oh.

01:13.769 --> 01:16.815
A-Am I to guess
that-that low numbers are bad?

01:16.859 --> 01:18.208
Mm.

01:18.252 --> 01:19.296
Yeah.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.863
Yeah. Let's see here.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.386
"Ask them

01:22.430 --> 01:25.476
what would make them
rate the show higher."

01:25.520 --> 01:27.870
<i>So what exactly
didn't you like about the show?</i>

01:27.913 --> 01:29.741
Very impressive.

01:29.785 --> 01:32.657
You know, that's just me running
the universe from my laptop.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.398
-Mm-hmm.

01:34.442 --> 01:36.487
<i>Yeah.
The cases are stupid.</i>

01:36.531 --> 01:39.577
<i>A fight over a barking dog?
Shoes that don't fit?</i>

01:39.621 --> 01:41.362
<i>Looks like a lot of you
are agreeing.</i>

01:41.405 --> 01:43.320
<i>-What would you rather see?
-Something that matters.</i>

01:43.364 --> 01:45.714
<i>-Something like burglary or...
Yeah.</i>

01:45.757 --> 01:47.542
<i>...robbery or something.</i>

01:47.585 --> 01:49.805
Yes, the wisdom of the crowd.

01:49.848 --> 01:52.112
Give them blood and violence
every time.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.766
Mm.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.771
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.425
Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:01.469 --> 02:02.818
-Di...
-Was I not paying you
enough attention?

02:02.861 --> 02:04.472
Oh. No, you weren't,

02:04.515 --> 02:06.735
-as a matter of fact.
-Oh, well, I'm going to now.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.651
All right. Here's the deal.

02:09.694 --> 02:12.915
They loved some things
and not others.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.525
Why do I care?

02:14.569 --> 02:16.440
-How many people
in a focus group?
-12.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.790
-Six men, six women.
-And I'm supposed to change
what I do

02:18.834 --> 02:20.705
-based on 12 people?

02:20.749 --> 02:23.143
-Uh, your first case is up,
Your Honor.

02:23.186 --> 02:25.275
Wait. So what does
this focus group

02:25.319 --> 02:26.624
-want me to do?
-No, no, no.

02:26.668 --> 02:27.886
Just ignore it. Just...

02:27.930 --> 02:31.063
psh-psh.
You just do you and ignore

02:31.107 --> 02:33.065
-everything they say.
-And what do they say?

02:33.109 --> 02:34.415
That they find
the court engaging

02:34.458 --> 02:37.026
and, uh, the costumes.

02:37.069 --> 02:38.854
And, uh, you.

02:38.897 --> 02:41.291
They think
you're smart, funny...

02:41.335 --> 02:42.640
I sense a "but" coming.

02:42.684 --> 02:45.469
They think
that the cases are, uh...

02:45.513 --> 02:48.342
-silly.
-Well, what do they want us
to do? A murder case?

02:48.385 --> 02:50.605
No, no, no,
that's never gonna happen.

02:50.648 --> 02:52.041
Right?

02:52.084 --> 02:53.173
I mean...

02:56.045 --> 02:57.742
There are...

02:57.786 --> 02:59.918
better cases.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.006
Yeah?

03:01.050 --> 03:02.530
Such as?

03:02.573 --> 03:04.053
I don't know.

03:04.096 --> 03:06.229
Like a... robbery?

03:06.273 --> 03:08.275
Oh. Okay.

03:08.318 --> 03:10.451
I'll leave you two
to find some bank robbers.

03:10.494 --> 03:11.974
-I got to get back to work.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.845
Hey. Hey, hey.

03:13.889 --> 03:14.846
Look,

03:14.890 --> 03:16.674
at some point,

03:16.718 --> 03:19.764
we have to start taking
this thing seriously, okay?

03:19.808 --> 03:22.114
His court needs this show.

03:22.158 --> 03:24.421
Look at Trump. He wasn't shit
until <i>The Apprentice.</i>

03:24.465 --> 03:25.683
Well, what do you want him
to do?

03:25.727 --> 03:26.771
Better cases.

03:26.815 --> 03:27.772
More drama.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.470
-Okay?
-Yeah. Okay.

03:32.429 --> 03:33.909
Shit.

03:38.566 --> 03:39.871
I want everybody to breathe.

03:39.915 --> 03:41.133
Breathe in. Everybody together.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.831
Come on, let out some stress.

03:42.874 --> 03:45.094
Come on, counselor, you're not
breathing. That's gas.

03:45.137 --> 03:46.661
Let's go. Five seconds inhale.

03:46.704 --> 03:49.664
One, two, three, four,

03:49.707 --> 03:51.318
-five, exhale.
-Hey.

03:51.361 --> 03:53.929
Thanks for agreeing
to see me, Mr. Cord.

03:53.972 --> 03:56.192
Do you mind if we, um,
talk outside?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.498
Okay, now, opening arguments.

03:57.541 --> 03:58.890
One at a time.

03:58.934 --> 04:01.110
As you can see,
STR Laurie forced us

04:01.153 --> 04:03.547
to lay off 20%
of our associates.

04:03.591 --> 04:06.202
I intend to hire them back
for my new firm.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.856
Aren't they the B-team?

04:07.899 --> 04:10.032
No. They are
all capable lawyers.

04:10.075 --> 04:12.513
The real key here, sir,

04:12.556 --> 04:14.950
is that
a new minority-owned law firm

04:14.993 --> 04:17.300
will be open
to no-bid government contracts

04:17.344 --> 04:18.867
-for the next eight years.
-Mm.

04:18.910 --> 04:21.086
Reddick & Lockhart,
no longer eligible.

04:21.130 --> 04:23.872
Mm. Julius...

04:23.915 --> 04:27.789
I'm a rich man, and I'm standing
in an alley outside a Copy Coop,

04:27.832 --> 04:29.486
in the middle of nowhere.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.096
-Why am I doing that?
-Uh,

04:31.140 --> 04:32.881
-because you think
it's the future?
-Right.

04:32.924 --> 04:35.971
And it has the potential to win.

04:36.014 --> 04:41.193
My career has been about siding
with, uh, successful disrupters.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.718
Financing the insane geniuses.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.110
This...

04:45.154 --> 04:47.330
disrupts nothing.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.027
I'm a Black conservative.

04:49.071 --> 04:52.335
This will be a Black law firm
that shares your values.

04:52.379 --> 04:55.338
Black law firm with
very little chance of success.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.645
I'm sorry. Julius,
look at your client list.

04:57.688 --> 05:00.561
I... I don't see this
as a winner.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.564
What about Diane Lockhart?

05:06.088 --> 05:08.960
Do you think
she has a winning client list?

05:09.004 --> 05:11.746
Is Diane Lockhart leaving
with you?

05:12.747 --> 05:13.748
She has...

05:13.791 --> 05:15.315
expressed interest.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.099
Okay.

05:17.142 --> 05:19.623
You come on back to me
with Diane and we'll talk.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.851
Diane, please.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.505
It's Julius.

05:32.506 --> 05:33.811
Oh, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

05:33.855 --> 05:35.726
Wait, I'm-I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.641
Sorry, sir.
I already wrote you up.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.556
W-- There's no meter here.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.384
You're in a purple zone.

05:41.428 --> 05:42.777
A pur...

05:42.820 --> 05:44.039
There's no such thing
as a purple zone.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.388
Court staff parking.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.129
What court

05:47.172 --> 05:49.087
-are you talking about?
-Judge Wackner's.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.135
Oh.

05:53.178 --> 05:54.919
Okay.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.268
Got it.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.966
-It's a joke.
-No, sir.

05:58.009 --> 06:00.490
But don't worry--
it's just a $40 ticket.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.797
Lady,
you can't just walk around,

06:02.840 --> 06:04.799
making up your own tickets.

06:04.842 --> 06:06.191
This is a public thoroughfare.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.630
You shouldn't have done that,
sir.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.719
Ma'am, you can't just make up
your own laws

06:11.762 --> 06:14.678
and paint the curb
any color that you want.

06:14.722 --> 06:17.594
The City of Chicago
controls public parking.

06:17.638 --> 06:20.205
Unfortunately, sir,
I just witnessed you disposing

06:20.249 --> 06:22.120
and vandalizing
a parking ticket,

06:22.164 --> 06:24.558
which will result in a $350 fine

06:24.601 --> 06:26.386
-on top of the $40...
-And you're trying
to confuse other people

06:26.429 --> 06:28.518
into paying tickets
by impersonating

06:28.562 --> 06:30.215
a parking enforcement official,

06:30.259 --> 06:32.043
which is illegal.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.393
Here you go, sir.

06:33.436 --> 06:34.698
Thank you.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.787
Sir, I just witnessed you
vandalizing

06:36.831 --> 06:38.398
a vandalization ticket,

06:38.441 --> 06:40.965
and that will result
in even a third fine.

06:44.229 --> 06:46.014
-Judgment for the defense.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.277
Please, face each other,
look at each other and say,

06:48.320 --> 06:49.713
"I love and respect you."

06:49.757 --> 06:51.323
-I love and respect you.
-I love and respect you.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.847
Beautiful.
Everybody in the courtroom

06:52.890 --> 06:54.414
give me a hee-haw.

06:54.457 --> 06:55.415
Hee-haw!

06:59.680 --> 07:02.117
So... maybe
this reality show was a mistake.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.423
Find out what I got to do

07:03.466 --> 07:05.120
-to get out of it.
-No.

07:05.163 --> 07:06.600
But this is what I will do.

07:06.643 --> 07:07.644
I'll find out
how they're portraying you.

07:07.688 --> 07:08.732
Because you want this to happen.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.560
Why do I want this to happen?

07:10.604 --> 07:12.083
Because you have fewer cases
this week than the week before

07:12.127 --> 07:14.216
and fewer
than the week before that.

07:14.259 --> 07:16.044
This court goes away unless
more people know you're here.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.219
Okay.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.831
So, what are you gonna do?

07:22.529 --> 07:25.619
Okay, I'm gonna exercise
this part of your contract.

07:25.662 --> 07:28.143
"Meaningful consultation
on cuts."

07:28.186 --> 07:29.361
I got that?

07:29.405 --> 07:30.362
You got that.

07:30.406 --> 07:31.451
Time to exercise it.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.236
Go kick some ass.

07:34.279 --> 07:36.194
Do you have a minute?

07:38.893 --> 07:41.417
David Cord is getting behind us.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.418
Behind?

07:42.462 --> 07:43.550
Our new firm.

07:43.593 --> 07:44.899
Julius,

07:44.942 --> 07:46.857
there is no new firm.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.990
I haven't said
I'm interested yet.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.861
You're on the outs here, Diane.

07:50.905 --> 07:53.429
David Lee is insisting
that I stay.

07:54.386 --> 07:56.519
Look at that.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.782
-You know what they're doing
right now?
-No.

07:58.826 --> 08:01.481
They're threatening to resign
unless you are replaced

08:01.524 --> 08:03.352
as name partner.

08:03.395 --> 08:06.442
At a certain point, it won't
matter what David Lee says.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.357
Your days are numbered here,
Diane.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.013
Okay, let me think about it.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.449
You need to act. Now.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.931
No. I need to think about it.

08:17.888 --> 08:20.195
Ah, Mr. Cord.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.284
Can you hear me?

08:22.327 --> 08:24.939
Yeah, yeah. It-It's good news.

08:24.982 --> 08:28.159
Uh, Diane and I
would like to meet.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.118
Can you hear me?

08:35.471 --> 08:36.428
Uh...

08:36.472 --> 08:38.518
I'll call back.

08:40.345 --> 08:41.390
Did I...

08:55.665 --> 08:56.927
Uh...

08:58.320 --> 09:00.061
-Hello? Hello?

09:00.104 --> 09:02.629
Uh, someone stole my car.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.892
Hi, Mr. Cain.
You say someone stole <i>your</i> car?

09:04.935 --> 09:07.634
Yes. Yeah, my-my space is gone.

09:07.677 --> 09:10.158
I mean, my car is gone.

09:10.201 --> 09:11.725
Are you sure you didn't park it
in the wrong space?

09:11.768 --> 09:12.987
It happens a lot.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.118
Yeah, but not to me!

09:14.162 --> 09:15.946
Did you try clicking the key?

09:15.990 --> 09:17.252
Yeah, I tried. I...

09:17.295 --> 09:18.688
You have to listen
for the chirp.

09:18.732 --> 09:21.386
I listened for the chirp.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.387
See?

09:24.215 --> 09:26.566
You probably mis-parked it.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.837
-Oh! Oh, no! No, no! Hey!

09:36.880 --> 09:39.753
Oh-ho, hey!
That's my ca-- that's my car!

09:39.796 --> 09:41.581
Hey! Hello!
Dude, can you stop him?!

09:41.624 --> 09:44.366
He's... That's my car! Hey!

09:44.409 --> 09:46.237
Come back!

09:48.675 --> 09:51.982
That guy just towed my car.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.157
Oh.

09:53.201 --> 09:54.637
<i>That</i> was your car?

09:54.681 --> 09:56.770
Yes, that was my car!

09:56.813 --> 09:57.945
You need to pay your tickets.

09:57.988 --> 09:58.989
What?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.889
Sir? Sir? Sir.

11:55.932 --> 11:58.239
Yes?
-There was trash
all around my car.

11:58.282 --> 11:59.849
How was I supposed to know
there was a hydrant...

11:59.893 --> 12:01.459
Hi.

12:01.503 --> 12:02.896
My car was towed,

12:02.939 --> 12:05.072
and, uh, the receipt said
it was towed here.

12:05.115 --> 12:07.335
Can I see your ticket?

12:07.378 --> 12:10.033
Uh, I-I don't have the ticket,
ma'am.

12:10.077 --> 12:11.861
There-there was no ticket,

12:11.905 --> 12:13.515
but here's the towing receipt.

12:13.558 --> 12:16.083
I actually need the ticket
so I can see you paid it.

12:17.171 --> 12:19.042
There was no way to pay it,
ma'am.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.044
It-it wasn't, uh,
an official ticket.

12:21.088 --> 12:23.351
I can't release the vehicle,
sir.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.918
You'll have
to get Parking Enforcement

12:24.961 --> 12:26.310
to reissue the ticket.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.356
Th-There was
no Parking Enforcement.

12:28.399 --> 12:30.314
Look.
You see this?

12:30.358 --> 12:32.229
The seal? Hmm?

12:32.273 --> 12:35.842
I-It says
"Wackner's City of Chicago."

12:35.885 --> 12:38.279
That's not a real seal.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.674
Okay, let me check for you.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.328
Thank you.

12:44.372 --> 12:45.765
You got one of those, too?

12:45.808 --> 12:47.288
Yeah.

12:47.331 --> 12:48.637
You did, too?

12:48.680 --> 12:50.204
Parking in a purple zone.

12:50.247 --> 12:52.119
-Wha-- Oh, my God.

12:52.162 --> 12:53.555
This is insane.

12:53.598 --> 12:55.339
Th-There is no such thing.

12:55.383 --> 12:56.601
How do they get away
with towing us?

12:56.645 --> 12:59.082
They don't. They can't.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.605
-They just did it.
-I'm sorry, sir.

13:00.649 --> 13:02.172
You'll have to get
a reissue of the ticket

13:02.216 --> 13:03.434
from Parking Enforcement.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.436
Wh-- This is nuts.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.829
What are you gonna do?

13:07.874 --> 13:10.485
I'm gonna go back there.
I'm gonna fight this.

13:10.528 --> 13:11.660
They can't get away with this.

13:11.703 --> 13:13.836
-I'll go, too.
-Good.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.359
We'll put up a united front.

13:15.403 --> 13:18.014
Damn right.
This is a scam.

13:18.058 --> 13:19.842
Excuse me.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.585
Where are the aces?

13:23.628 --> 13:25.456
Oh, wow. Magic.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.675
Where are the aces?

13:27.937 --> 13:30.026
Here, here, here and here.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.680
No.

13:34.291 --> 13:37.729
Oh, my God.
How did you do that?

13:37.773 --> 13:40.036
So what is it you need, David?

13:40.080 --> 13:42.560
You're happy with what
we're doing for you, right?

13:42.604 --> 13:43.823
What your firm is doing?

13:43.866 --> 13:45.346
Yes.

13:45.389 --> 13:46.869
-I am.
-Good.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.002
Then bring
all your business to us.

13:49.045 --> 13:51.091
West Coast, East Coast, Europe.

13:51.134 --> 13:52.701
You'd be surprised
how much synergy

13:52.744 --> 13:54.224
between your legal strategies

13:54.268 --> 13:56.661
can streamline
your financial issues.

13:56.705 --> 13:57.749
No.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.317
Why not?

14:00.361 --> 14:01.884
-Aren't you happy with us?
-Sure.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.582
-Things are going well.
-Then let us memorialize

14:04.626 --> 14:06.106
a fuller representation
of your business.

14:06.149 --> 14:09.196
David, you're losing one
of your name partners.

14:09.239 --> 14:10.458
Scuse me?

14:10.501 --> 14:12.590
You're losing Diane Lockhart.

14:12.634 --> 14:16.072
I won't go to a firm
that's breaking apart.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.596
We're not...

14:18.640 --> 14:22.644
I don't know where you heard
that, but it's not true.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.473
Where did you hear that?

14:25.516 --> 14:26.909
Where's the queen?

14:35.657 --> 14:36.876
Liz,

14:36.919 --> 14:38.138
we need to talk.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.704
-I'm in a meeting.
-That's right.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.445
With me. Now.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.974
Diane, upstairs.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.105
In ten minutes.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.324
No.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.206
<i>In three weeks,</i>

15:03.250 --> 15:05.165
the board of STR Laurie

15:05.208 --> 15:08.298
is coming from London and Dubai
to meet the partners and staff.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.431
They want to observe
and be impressed

15:10.474 --> 15:12.085
by a well-oiled machine.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.260
That's what I promised them.

15:13.303 --> 15:14.391
Okay.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.697
But that's not what I'm seeing.

15:15.740 --> 15:16.654
We're making it work, David.

15:16.698 --> 15:18.874
No, you're not.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.008
Are you leaving the firm?

15:23.487 --> 15:24.706
Excuse me?

15:24.749 --> 15:26.099
I was told
you're leaving the firm.

15:27.622 --> 15:28.884
By whom?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.408
-David Cord.
-What the hell?

15:31.452 --> 15:33.062
What's going on, Diane?

15:35.325 --> 15:37.327
I was asked
to join another firm.

15:37.371 --> 15:39.373
What firm?

15:40.374 --> 15:42.115
I can't say.

15:42.158 --> 15:43.855
But you're considering it.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.860
I was told
that the equity partners

15:48.904 --> 15:50.601
are threatening to resign

15:50.645 --> 15:51.820
unless I resign.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.736
So, yes, I'm...

15:54.779 --> 15:57.652
I'm considering any offer
that I'm...

15:57.695 --> 15:59.306
that I'm given.

16:00.263 --> 16:03.832
No one is threatening to resign
without my permission.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.052
And if you were to poach
even one of our clients,

16:06.095 --> 16:08.141
you wouldn't survive
the lawsuit.

16:08.184 --> 16:09.620
David, don't threaten me.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.622
I'm not poaching any clients.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.581
Although they'd certainly be free

16:13.624 --> 16:15.104
-to make whatever decision
they want.
-And we're supposed

16:15.148 --> 16:16.714
to believe
that you wouldn't poach clients

16:16.758 --> 16:17.802
after the stunt you pulled
with the teamsters?

16:17.846 --> 16:19.152
Okay.

16:19.195 --> 16:22.198
Diane, what are your issues?

16:23.895 --> 16:26.202
I'm a name partner
being squeezed out

16:26.246 --> 16:27.987
of the decision-making process.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.075
And why is that, Diane?

16:29.118 --> 16:30.511
Because of my race.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.382
Because no one respects
your decision

16:32.426 --> 16:34.602
to stay in your position.

16:34.645 --> 16:37.257
-It is not yours by right.
I fought

16:37.300 --> 16:39.824
as hard as anyone here
to keep this firm solvent.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.001
And I didn't inherit this firm.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.829
-I was invited in,
and I earned...
-And for that you are paid

16:44.873 --> 16:46.962
-a yearly bonus.
You don't own...
-I was invited to the firm,

16:47.006 --> 16:49.138
-and I earned
my name partnership because...
-...the-the respect

16:49.182 --> 16:50.705
-of the associates.
You have to earn it.
-...of the powerful clients

16:50.748 --> 16:52.620
-that I brought in.
-Okay! That's it! Stop.

16:53.664 --> 16:54.970
Both of you,

16:55.014 --> 16:56.319
go to my desk.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.320
What?

16:57.364 --> 16:59.105
I said go to my desk,

16:59.148 --> 17:00.280
both of you.

17:00.323 --> 17:01.977
Are you gonna spank us?

17:02.021 --> 17:04.980
Stand on both sides of my desk.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.895
Now.

17:08.679 --> 17:10.812
Is this
some sort of trust exercise?

17:10.855 --> 17:12.466
Yes.

17:12.509 --> 17:13.728
Grab both ends.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.382
On three, pick it up

17:15.425 --> 17:17.906
and carry it the fuck down
into your office, Liz.

17:17.949 --> 17:19.734
Because if you don't solve
your differences

17:19.777 --> 17:21.083
in the next 24 hours,

17:21.127 --> 17:24.130
I'm coming to live
and work with you.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.522
And you don't want me down there

17:25.566 --> 17:27.481
solving your problems for you.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.048
Do you understand?

17:32.181 --> 17:34.792
If you're going to leave,
there's...

17:34.836 --> 17:36.055
nothing to talk about.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.317
Liz.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.885
I don't want to leave this firm.

17:40.929 --> 17:43.758
And you don't want me to leave.

17:43.801 --> 17:47.414
So why don't we hire a partner
to replace Boseman?

17:50.156 --> 17:51.548
-I'll think about it. <i></i>

17:51.592 --> 17:53.159
Okay, what do we got?

17:53.202 --> 17:54.464
Parking violations, Your Honor.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.987
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.512
Our cars were stolen
by you and this court.

17:58.555 --> 18:01.428
-We did nothing wrong.
-They were in staff parking?

18:01.471 --> 18:02.994
Yes. And he tore up his ticket.

18:03.038 --> 18:04.300
And then he tore up the ticket

18:04.344 --> 18:05.432
-for vandalizing the ticket.
-Sir.

18:05.475 --> 18:06.781
I'm a lawyer.

18:06.824 --> 18:08.739
If you don't give us
our cars back,

18:08.783 --> 18:10.611
our next call
will be to the police,

18:10.654 --> 18:12.482
for your illegal seizure.

18:12.526 --> 18:14.484
-A class 2 felony.
What if I give you a chance

18:14.528 --> 18:16.399
to say "I'm sorry"
and then I forgive your tickets?

18:16.443 --> 18:19.098
We have nothing
to apologize for, sir.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.100
-We've done nothing wrong.
Yes!

18:21.143 --> 18:22.362
-I'm sorry.
-Uh, me, too,

18:22.405 --> 18:23.754
-Your Honor.
-Apologies accepted.

18:23.798 --> 18:25.365
-Rita, give 'em their stickers.
-Mm.

18:25.408 --> 18:28.194
But you don't want to apologize,
is that right, sir?

18:28.237 --> 18:30.544
Uh, because you stole my car?
No. No.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.198
I-I want to go to the police.

18:32.241 --> 18:33.547
And then I want an apology

18:33.590 --> 18:35.331
-from you.
-Okay. Good.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.724
-Next case.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.204
You're making a big mistake.

18:38.247 --> 18:39.944
No. All you have to do
is apologize

18:39.988 --> 18:41.424
and you get your car back.

18:41.468 --> 18:42.860
I don't think I'm the one
making the mistake here.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.123
This is bullshit!

18:44.166 --> 18:46.560
-Maybe. Next case.

18:46.603 --> 18:49.650
-Your Honor, I have a few other
smaller parking matters.
-Yeah.

18:49.693 --> 18:52.479
We want to add more
purple spaces up the street.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.916
Oh, good. We need
more reserved staff parking.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.787
Thank you, Rita.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.267
Have a good day.

18:58.311 --> 19:00.704
Okay, come on up, sir.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.619
<i>Takes hard work to get funny.</i>

19:02.663 --> 19:03.838
<i>Maybe you know that.</i>

19:03.881 --> 19:05.405
<i>But you haven't done anything</i>

19:05.448 --> 19:08.103
<i>for the women you hurt.</i>

19:08.147 --> 19:10.323
<i>You haven't made amends.</i>

19:10.366 --> 19:12.412
<i>You don't even seem remorseful.</i>

19:12.455 --> 19:14.153
<i>When I was in the IDF,
I learned a lot.</i>

19:14.196 --> 19:15.937
<i>A lot about life.</i>

19:15.980 --> 19:19.810
<i>But also a lot about people
and how to talk to them.</i>

19:19.854 --> 19:21.421
Okay. What's his issue?

19:21.464 --> 19:23.510
It's not his issue. It's mine.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.164
Okay, uh, what's your issue?

19:25.207 --> 19:26.991
Your reedit. It's all about me.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.732
What are you talking about?

19:28.776 --> 19:30.473
You reedited the pilot
to be all about me.

19:30.517 --> 19:32.562
No, we didn't. Loo...

19:36.087 --> 19:39.265
Max, step outside for a moment.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.749
-What are you doing, man?

19:45.793 --> 19:47.621
This is supposed
to be Wackner's court,

19:47.664 --> 19:49.579
-not the court clerk.
-You told me to make it better.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.364
Yeah, man.
Better in the same genre,

19:51.407 --> 19:53.104
not a love letter to your crush.

19:53.148 --> 19:54.758
She's the best thing
about the show.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.238
She's the smartest person
in that room.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.631
She fights
for what she believes in.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.241
She looks great on camera.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.852
That-That's my objective opinion
as an editor.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.767
You need help.
You told me to
make it better.

20:03.811 --> 20:07.206
It needed passion, direction.
Now it has it.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.903
She makes Wackner
ten times better

20:08.946 --> 20:09.904
than he has any right to be.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.819
Okay,

20:11.862 --> 20:14.387
you make Wackner the star

20:14.430 --> 20:15.997
or you are fired.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.347
Okay?

20:24.745 --> 20:27.791
Okay. We are on it.

20:27.835 --> 20:30.141
We, uh,

20:30.185 --> 20:32.318
overadjusted, but...

20:32.361 --> 20:33.797
now we're back on track.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.634
This is stupid.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.375
What am I doing?

20:47.811 --> 20:50.031
What are you looking for?

20:50.074 --> 20:52.686
A good lawyer. Someone Black.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.601
Partner material.

20:55.732 --> 20:57.865
Someone who's friendly with me

20:57.908 --> 21:00.563
but not so friendly
that Liz rejects him.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.261
Or her.

21:03.740 --> 21:06.177
Prosecutor or defense?

21:07.135 --> 21:08.441
It doesn't matter.

21:08.484 --> 21:09.442
Either one.

21:09.485 --> 21:10.921
I was always defense,

21:10.965 --> 21:13.968
but Liz came
from the U.S. Attorney's Office.

21:14.925 --> 21:17.624
So, prosecutor?

21:17.667 --> 21:20.975
Mm. But someone
who wants to work here.

21:21.018 --> 21:22.977
And it-it needs to be a name.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.457
Go for a woman.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.067
Romney's binders

21:26.110 --> 21:27.982
-of women.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.638
We were too hard on him,
weren't we?

21:31.681 --> 21:33.466
Yes, we were.

21:33.509 --> 21:38.209
God, the latest partisan fight
always takes precedent.

21:39.210 --> 21:41.256
But not with you.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.824
You were friends with Scalia
forever.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.260
Yes.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.870
I liked him.

21:46.914 --> 21:49.046
So is that who I want,

21:49.090 --> 21:52.528
someone I disagree with
on most things

21:52.572 --> 21:53.964
but...

21:54.008 --> 21:55.314
whom I like?

21:55.357 --> 21:57.968
That's something
that only you would know.

21:58.012 --> 22:01.537
But I need someone who Liz
will think that I don't want,

22:01.581 --> 22:03.974
so then she will want her.

22:04.018 --> 22:05.672
You know who I'm thinking of?

22:05.715 --> 22:09.110
I do. Because that's why
I thought of you.

22:09.153 --> 22:11.417
She was your law clerk,
wasn't she?

22:11.460 --> 22:12.809
Yes, for five years.

22:12.853 --> 22:15.116
-Allegra Durado.
-Allegra Durado.

22:15.159 --> 22:16.596
How do you know her?

22:16.639 --> 22:18.424
EMILY's List.

22:18.467 --> 22:21.122
I saw her at events. I knew her
well enough to say hello.

22:21.165 --> 22:23.211
-Ah.
-What is she doing now?

22:23.254 --> 22:25.648
I don't know.
She left me to write a book.

22:25.692 --> 22:28.042
Some enormous tome on truth.

22:28.085 --> 22:30.044
Is she still mentally... acute?

22:30.087 --> 22:31.524
I heard she had a meltdown.

22:31.567 --> 22:34.440
Oh, really? I...
I believe that's hearsay

22:34.483 --> 22:36.790
promulgated by her ex-husband.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.661
He has since been committed.

22:41.055 --> 22:42.665
Why don't you call her?

22:44.014 --> 22:45.494
Mm.

22:47.540 --> 22:48.845
God, I miss you.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.369
I'm not gone.

23:11.912 --> 23:13.435
Hi.

23:13.479 --> 23:16.177
I was here earlier
about my court being towed.

23:16.220 --> 23:17.352
-Your court?
-Sorry.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.788
My car.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.616
Here's the receipt.

23:21.617 --> 23:22.879
Oh, yeah.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.315
Gimme a sec.

23:25.316 --> 23:27.101
Mr. Cain?

23:27.144 --> 23:28.842
-Yes?
-I'm Officer Harp,

23:28.885 --> 23:30.539
and this is Ardor.
Based on observing

23:30.583 --> 23:33.063
the stolen parking fee
receipt booklet in your hand,

23:33.107 --> 23:35.283
we got probable cause under the
Fourth Amendment to determine

23:35.326 --> 23:36.980
-that a crime was committed.
-Wait, wait, wait.
You got to be kidding.

23:37.024 --> 23:38.373
We're taking you
into custody now.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.896
-You're coming with us.
-This is insane.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.420
-Wait. Hey, hey, hey.
-No, sir. Please just put

23:41.463 --> 23:42.246
-your hands behind your back.
-No, no, no, no.

23:42.290 --> 23:43.465
It's a fake court.

23:43.509 --> 23:44.901
They took my car.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.555
-None of it is real!
-As real

23:46.599 --> 23:48.252
-as Officer McFinley's death?
-What-what...

23:48.296 --> 23:49.645
-what did you just say?
-Put your hands

23:49.689 --> 23:50.559
-behind your back, sir.
-She just said

23:50.603 --> 23:51.865
"Officer McFinley."

23:51.908 --> 23:52.996
-Is that what this is about?
-This is

23:53.040 --> 23:54.389
about you stealing $2,000 worth

23:54.433 --> 23:55.738
-of court merchandise.

23:55.782 --> 23:57.697
Just enough to make it
a class 3 felony.

23:57.740 --> 23:58.698
That's right.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.681
Diane Lockhart.

24:25.725 --> 24:27.683
Hey. Allegra.

24:27.727 --> 24:29.119
Wow.

24:29.163 --> 24:31.600
This is like stepping
into your mind.

24:31.644 --> 24:34.037
No. My mind is more...

24:39.652 --> 24:41.044
Okay, this could be
a short conversation.

24:41.088 --> 24:43.525
I didn't know
you were at a law firm.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.659
Oh. No, I'm not. They just
let me use their empty offices.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.487
Or the first regime did.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.880
I don't know if this current
regime even knows I'm here.

24:53.361 --> 24:54.536
Why short?

24:56.712 --> 24:59.541
-Excuse me?
-You said "short conversation."

24:59.585 --> 25:00.760
H-Hold on.

25:01.717 --> 25:04.459
-Is this all for your book?
-I think so.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.939
Um, I'm not sure.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.723
It's still finding itself.

25:07.767 --> 25:10.204
Sometimes it's a book
about Civil War justice.

25:10.247 --> 25:13.599
Other times, it's a book
about the nature and history

25:13.642 --> 25:14.991
-of truth.
-Ooh.

25:15.035 --> 25:17.254
Well...
that's ambitious.

25:17.298 --> 25:20.040
So, this is, uh,
going to be an odd start,

25:20.083 --> 25:24.348
but... Ruth Ginsburg
has been appearing to me.

25:24.392 --> 25:26.525
And she mentioned your name.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.095
Really?

25:32.139 --> 25:33.401
Yes. Really.

25:33.444 --> 25:36.099
Well, you're right.

25:36.143 --> 25:38.188
It's an odd way to start.

25:39.625 --> 25:40.800
Messy!

25:42.149 --> 25:43.411
M-Messy?

25:43.454 --> 25:45.718
When I said,
"No, my mind is more..."

25:45.761 --> 25:47.589
-"Messy."
-Oh. Right.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.591
-I hated leaving that
unresolved.

25:49.635 --> 25:52.333
So wh-why did Ruth mention me?

25:52.376 --> 25:55.205
Well, I'm a partner
-at Reddick/
-Lockhart.

25:55.249 --> 25:57.120
We're looking
for a third partner,

25:57.164 --> 25:59.122
someone with legendary status,

25:59.166 --> 26:00.428
like yourself.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.299
I haven't worked at a firm
in years.

26:02.343 --> 26:04.519
Work at a firm?
You started a firm.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.434
Well, I haven't run a firm
in years.

26:06.477 --> 26:08.262
Well, then come and work
with us.

26:14.007 --> 26:15.486
It just feels a little too safe,

26:15.530 --> 26:16.923
like we're pulling our punches.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.577
Well, it's the cases
that he picks.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.491
I mean, it's three people
with parking tickets.

26:20.535 --> 26:22.581
Suing the potato chip company.

26:24.757 --> 26:26.410
Remember that moment
when Wackner yelled at me?

26:26.454 --> 26:27.455
Yeah.

26:27.498 --> 26:29.675
I wanted to... go punch him.

26:29.718 --> 26:32.242
I was like,
"Don't make Marissa cry."

26:32.286 --> 26:34.157
I didn't cry.

26:34.201 --> 26:37.770
I-I can edit it
so you are crying, if you want.

26:39.162 --> 26:42.035
<i>-Are you questioning
my integrity?</i>

26:45.560 --> 26:47.257
In another century,
they would burn people

26:47.301 --> 26:48.868
who can do what you do.

26:48.911 --> 26:50.609
You're funnier in person.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.567
I'm a lot of things in person.

26:52.611 --> 26:53.612
I know.

26:55.701 --> 26:56.702
Let's see the footage.

26:56.745 --> 26:58.225
How much time do you have?

26:58.268 --> 27:00.488
They need it streamed
to Vegas in an hour.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.882
<i>Are you questioning
my integrity?</i>

27:02.925 --> 27:05.928
<i>-I'm asking if you prejudged...
-No!</i>

27:05.972 --> 27:10.759
<i>You will answer my question
before you ask me yours.</i>

27:13.457 --> 27:14.502
Been told not to use it.

27:14.545 --> 27:17.200
Really? I like it. It's drama.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.684
<i>You will answer my question</i>

27:22.728 --> 27:24.555
<i>-before you ask me y...
-If you've already d...</i>

27:26.862 --> 27:29.125
Mr. Cain, good to have you back.

27:29.169 --> 27:30.953
Okay. If I stole something--

27:30.997 --> 27:32.607
and I'm not admitting
that I did--

27:32.651 --> 27:34.304
why am I here in this court?

27:34.348 --> 27:35.697
This fake court.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.917
If it was a real charge,
I should be taken

27:37.960 --> 27:40.049
-to Grand and Central.
-Danny Trumpet for the defense,
Your Honor.

27:40.093 --> 27:43.487
We ask for immediate release
on his own recognizance.

27:43.531 --> 27:44.619
Danny, you're still wearing
your devil horns.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.274
Oh.
Apologies, Your Honor.

27:47.317 --> 27:49.929
I was, uh, Devil's Advocate
in the last case.

27:49.972 --> 27:52.018
What the hell's going on?
-Let me argue for you, sir.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.454
A lawyer is a fool
for his own client.

27:53.497 --> 27:55.195
That's not even how that goes!

27:55.238 --> 27:56.805
Your Honor,
this is why the prosecution

27:56.849 --> 27:58.589
requests denial of bail.

27:58.633 --> 28:01.592
-Mr. Cord?
-Julius Cain has a prior

28:01.636 --> 28:03.420
bribery charge, so we believe

28:03.464 --> 28:05.596
-that he is a flight risk.
-Okay,

28:05.640 --> 28:08.425
-I want to get taken
to Grand and Central right now.
-Your Honor,

28:08.469 --> 28:10.645
Mr. Cain was pardoned
for that bribery charge,

28:10.689 --> 28:11.951
and it was stricken
from his record.

28:11.994 --> 28:13.692
Only due to a payoff

28:13.735 --> 28:14.910
to the Trump administration.

28:14.954 --> 28:15.955
What? No!

28:15.998 --> 28:17.217
No, I never paid anyone off!

28:17.260 --> 28:19.001
Let me argue for you, please!

28:19.045 --> 28:21.264
Your Honor, this is an outrage.

28:21.308 --> 28:23.266
An outrage. Look at this man.

28:23.310 --> 28:24.746
He has done nothing wrong.

28:24.790 --> 28:27.793
The stolen ticket book
was found on his person.

28:27.836 --> 28:29.403
Which is the whole point
of a trial!

28:29.446 --> 28:31.797
But let me tell you a story
about this man.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.408
A man who grew up poor
and alone.

28:34.451 --> 28:35.888
-Son of a janitor.
-What are you talking about?

28:35.931 --> 28:37.541
His only friends--

28:37.585 --> 28:40.153
the comic books
he kept always by his side.

28:40.196 --> 28:42.764
Phil, <i>This Is Us-like</i> music.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.115
And that's how
he got into the law.

28:46.159 --> 28:47.638
He would create stories

28:47.682 --> 28:48.944
with the characters
from the comic books.

28:48.988 --> 28:51.512
What would happen
with the Human Torch

28:51.555 --> 28:53.340
if he was accused of assault?

28:53.383 --> 28:55.255
And that brings us to today.

28:55.298 --> 28:56.996
Julius Cain has too much respect
for the law

28:57.039 --> 28:58.911
to commit these crimes.

28:58.954 --> 29:02.175
How could the defender
of the Human Torch

29:02.218 --> 29:03.959
do what these officers say
he done?

29:04.003 --> 29:07.571
And how could he be imprisoned
for a mere parking ticket?

29:07.615 --> 29:09.530
No. Your Honor, if he had paid

29:09.573 --> 29:11.706
the parking ticket,
that would be one thing.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.752
But he kept destroying property.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.797
He kept expressing his disdain
for this court.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.452
And then he stole
this court's property.

29:18.495 --> 29:21.063
-Then prove it at trial.
-No, I'll do better. Ask him,

29:21.107 --> 29:24.458
Your Honor. Could you stop
with that, please?

29:24.501 --> 29:25.764
Your Honor, if Julius

29:25.807 --> 29:27.374
is released
on his own recognizance,

29:27.417 --> 29:29.289
will he return to this court
for his trial date?

29:29.332 --> 29:30.856
That is an unfair question.

29:30.899 --> 29:32.379
Why is that unfair?

29:32.422 --> 29:34.555
That's the whole point
of a trial hearing.

29:34.598 --> 29:38.994
Julius has too much respect
for the rule of law

29:39.038 --> 29:42.084
to deign to even answer
such a question.

29:42.128 --> 29:43.999
It's a worthy question.

29:44.043 --> 29:45.000
Mr. Cain,

29:45.044 --> 29:47.307
if I release you,

29:47.350 --> 29:49.004
will you return for your trial?

29:49.048 --> 29:50.963
Say yes.
Say yes, say yes, say yes.

29:51.006 --> 29:53.879
Uh... Your Honor...

29:53.922 --> 29:55.054
Sir...

29:56.533 --> 29:58.187
...these officers brought me
here today in retaliation

29:58.231 --> 30:00.276
for the death of an officer
who was murdered

30:00.320 --> 30:02.017
after we sued the city.

30:02.061 --> 30:04.237
This-this court is being used!

30:04.280 --> 30:05.847
And you are being used!

30:05.891 --> 30:08.415
You're not planning
on returning for trial, are you?

30:08.458 --> 30:10.286
Uh-uh. That's not what he said.

30:11.766 --> 30:13.115
Are you, sir?

30:14.987 --> 30:17.380
Uh, are you fuckin' nuts?!

30:17.424 --> 30:18.686
-This is a joke!

30:18.729 --> 30:20.122
This isn't a court!

30:20.166 --> 30:23.343
This-this is a police attack
on our firm!

30:23.386 --> 30:25.040
On me!

30:25.084 --> 30:27.086
Bail denied. Arrestee
will be remanded until trial.

30:27.129 --> 30:30.393
-W-W-W-Wait, wait!

30:33.092 --> 30:37.705
Isn't the whole point of this
court to have a speedy trial?

30:37.748 --> 30:38.706
Yes, sir.

30:38.749 --> 30:39.707
All right then.

30:39.750 --> 30:40.882
I want a speedy trial.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.318
I'm ready to go right now.

30:45.017 --> 30:45.974
Uh, but I'm not...

30:46.018 --> 30:48.237
I don't need you.

30:48.281 --> 30:49.717
I'm ready to go.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.501
Prosecution's ready.

30:52.241 --> 30:54.069
Can you control yourself?

30:56.680 --> 31:00.032
<i>No! Goddamn it.
You will answer my question</i>

31:00.075 --> 31:01.947
<i>before you ask me yours.</i>

31:01.990 --> 31:05.472
<i>If you've already decided how
this case will end, Your Honor,</i>

31:05.515 --> 31:07.387
<i>if we're here to give Del
the ending that he wants</i>

31:07.430 --> 31:08.997
<i>for his TV show, then yes,</i>

31:09.041 --> 31:10.738
<i>I am questioning your integrity.</i>

31:10.781 --> 31:12.000
<i>You pack up your things</i>

31:12.044 --> 31:13.610
<i>and you get the fuck out
of here.</i>

31:13.654 --> 31:14.698
<i>The women
who have trusted this court</i>

31:14.742 --> 31:16.439
<i>deserve representation.</i>

31:24.491 --> 31:26.623
Hello. Ms. Durado?

31:26.667 --> 31:27.929
Yes. Ms. Reddick?

31:27.973 --> 31:30.062
Yes. Is that a comic book?

31:30.105 --> 31:31.367
It is?

31:31.411 --> 31:32.629
Huh.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.414
-Do you enjoy comic books?
-No.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.548
There's a maze on the back.
I was doing the maze.

31:38.592 --> 31:39.854
Oh.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.769
-Do you want to come back?
-Yes.

31:43.336 --> 31:44.424
Thanks for seeing me.

31:44.467 --> 31:46.208
I know this is weird, but...

31:46.252 --> 31:49.124
I'm trying to drag my brain out
of the book I'm writing

31:49.168 --> 31:51.387
-and get back
to some practical law.
-Ah.

31:51.431 --> 31:53.389
So I'm meeting
with some top partners,

31:53.433 --> 31:55.217
and someone suggested you.

31:55.261 --> 31:57.959
Well, I am honored.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.266
What are you looking for?

32:00.309 --> 32:02.094
A position, I guess.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.965
This is nice.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.575
Great corner.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.926
-Northwestern sun.
-Yeah.

32:07.969 --> 32:09.449
Is that Willis Tower?

32:09.492 --> 32:11.842
Uh, no. No, it's over there.

32:11.886 --> 32:13.932
-Oh.
-Have a seat.

32:13.975 --> 32:16.847
So, I guess
I'm looking to run a firm.

32:16.891 --> 32:19.459
What are your suggestions?

32:24.899 --> 32:27.336
Did Diane Lockhart
reach out to you?

32:27.380 --> 32:29.034
She did.

32:29.077 --> 32:32.167
She suggested you come in here
and talk about a position

32:32.211 --> 32:34.996
so that I would offer you
the partnership here

32:35.040 --> 32:36.955
and think it was my idea?

32:36.998 --> 32:38.391
Yes.

32:38.434 --> 32:42.003
Diane thinks
that you will side with her

32:42.047 --> 32:44.005
in partnership decisions
instead of me?

32:44.049 --> 32:45.311
That's right.

32:46.312 --> 32:47.791
And what if I hire you?

32:47.835 --> 32:49.010
Will you do that?

32:49.054 --> 32:50.229
No.

32:50.272 --> 32:51.839
Why?

32:51.882 --> 32:53.884
I'm not a political person.

32:53.928 --> 32:56.017
When people convince me,
I side with them.

32:56.061 --> 32:59.325
That's why I clerked
for Scalia and Ginsburg.

33:00.804 --> 33:03.068
Will you tell Diane
about this conversation?

33:03.111 --> 33:05.070
Only if she asks.

33:10.814 --> 33:11.990
Oh.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.741
Well, damn. Look at you.

33:24.785 --> 33:25.960
Aw, thank you.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.005
How'd Max do?

33:28.615 --> 33:30.921
Uh... good. I think.

33:30.965 --> 33:32.923
The cut is out.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.012
What's going on here?

33:34.055 --> 33:35.100
What are the cops doing?

33:35.143 --> 33:36.144
Bringing the drama.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.145
Lots of it, too.

33:37.189 --> 33:38.538
What drama?

33:38.581 --> 33:40.453
Parking ticket
turned felony 3 theft.

33:40.496 --> 33:43.021
-You're kidding.
That sounds cool.

33:47.547 --> 33:49.027
Oh, my God.

33:50.811 --> 33:53.074
Julius, what are you doing?

33:53.118 --> 33:56.425
Questioning my life and sanity.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.862
-Are you the felony 3?
-Ma'am, we need you
to step back.

33:59.863 --> 34:02.083
Fuck you. I'm the court clerk.
You step back.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.693
Call the office.

34:03.737 --> 34:06.174
Tell 'em I have to cancel
my afternoon appointments.

34:06.218 --> 34:08.176
Maybe for the next three years
if I'm jailed

34:08.220 --> 34:10.265
-in your <i>Candy Land</i> prison.
-Oh, my God.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.097
-What are you doing
prosecuting Julius Cain?

34:16.141 --> 34:18.491
What am I doing? My job.

34:18.534 --> 34:20.449
But he's from our firm.

34:20.493 --> 34:23.365
-So?
-So it's bullshit! Let him go!

34:23.409 --> 34:25.367
No.
You're the one who accused me

34:25.411 --> 34:27.587
of bending justice
to give Del that happy ending

34:27.630 --> 34:29.284
-he was looking for.
-This is different.

34:29.328 --> 34:32.287
-How?
-Because he's-he's...

34:32.331 --> 34:34.028
from your law firm.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.725
More the reason
not to bend the rules for him.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.901
Oh, my God!
When did you become...

34:37.945 --> 34:39.642
some person you've become?

34:45.213 --> 34:48.260
Diane, I need you to come down
to Wackner's court right now.

34:48.303 --> 34:50.088
<i>Julius is being prosecuted.</i>

34:51.959 --> 34:53.743
For what?

35:00.881 --> 35:02.404
Ah. The cavalry has arrived.

35:02.448 --> 35:04.276
What's going on?

35:04.319 --> 35:07.453
I'm about to be sent to prison
for parking in a purple zone.

35:07.496 --> 35:09.150
-What does that mean?
-If I explained it to you,

35:09.194 --> 35:10.673
it wouldn't make any more sense.

35:10.717 --> 35:12.719
You seeing the...?

35:14.068 --> 35:15.374
Oh, yes.

35:15.417 --> 35:16.462
It's payback.

35:16.505 --> 35:17.811
Should we call the police?

35:17.854 --> 35:18.812
The real ones?

35:18.855 --> 35:20.074
Those are the real ones.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.467
What about the S.A.'s office?

35:21.510 --> 35:23.338
They're not our friends.

35:23.382 --> 35:26.036
I can't imagine that they're
happy about make-believe court.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.735
Yeah, well, if it fucks with us,
then they might be.

35:29.692 --> 35:31.868
Good news.
We just did another Vegas test

35:31.912 --> 35:32.869
with the new edit.

35:32.913 --> 35:34.741
-Can't wait.
-Look.

35:34.784 --> 35:36.221
That is where you blew up.

35:36.264 --> 35:37.918
-When did I blow up?
-Don't get upset.

35:37.961 --> 35:40.138
And, look,
I didn't approve of this,

35:40.181 --> 35:42.270
but our editor
dropped in the explosion

35:42.314 --> 35:44.446
where Marissa accused you
of using the court

35:44.490 --> 35:45.795
to further my personal interest.

35:45.839 --> 35:48.146
-What?
-They want you to explode.

35:48.189 --> 35:50.974
They want to see you-you care
about something.

35:51.018 --> 35:53.760
They want to see
cases that matter.

35:53.803 --> 35:55.196
Look, I'll be honest with you.

35:55.240 --> 35:58.199
We haven't had 95% on anything.

35:58.243 --> 35:59.809
Not on any reality show.

35:59.853 --> 36:01.463
Okay? But that's what you have.

36:01.507 --> 36:04.379
Hal, you're a hit.
They love you.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.426
I just want my court
to keep going.

36:07.469 --> 36:10.037
Okay. You keep doing this,

36:10.080 --> 36:12.648
you keep doing cases
just like this

36:12.692 --> 36:15.216
and we'll keep your court going.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.740
Julius Cain,

36:17.784 --> 36:22.180
you have been charged
with misusing parking privileges

36:22.223 --> 36:24.094
and with stealing
court property.

36:24.138 --> 36:25.487
Of course,
that means nothing to you,

36:25.531 --> 36:27.359
because you do not respect
this court,

36:27.402 --> 36:29.535
something I take personally.

36:29.578 --> 36:33.495
Especially coming from a former
judge convicted of bribery.

36:33.539 --> 36:36.237
-Mr. Wackner...
-No.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.370
You and your colleagues think

36:38.413 --> 36:41.416
you get to decide when and how

36:41.460 --> 36:43.244
-justice is determined.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.420
You think it is your right

36:45.464 --> 36:48.206
to make and break the rules
as you see fit.

36:48.249 --> 36:49.511
Mr. Wackner,

36:49.555 --> 36:51.165
-you're being unfair.
-You do not

36:51.209 --> 36:53.776
own the law, Mr. Cain.

36:53.820 --> 36:56.301
The law does not belong to you

36:56.344 --> 36:57.911
-or your law firm.

36:57.954 --> 36:59.913
The law belongs to the people.

36:59.956 --> 37:02.132
-Damn right!
That's right.

37:02.176 --> 37:03.264
USA!

37:03.308 --> 37:06.049
USA! USA!

37:06.093 --> 37:07.921
-USA! USA!

37:11.141 --> 37:12.360
Thank you.

37:12.404 --> 37:14.493
How odd to be back
in the saddle.

37:14.536 --> 37:15.842
I can't wait to get to know you.

37:15.885 --> 37:17.191
And us you.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.932
-Your reputation precedes you.
-Mm-hmm.

37:18.975 --> 37:21.326
-I hope that's a good thing.

37:21.369 --> 37:23.589
-Look who's relieved.
-Yeah.
Anyway,

37:23.632 --> 37:25.852
-I'll be needing
a lot of help from you all.
-It's taken the heat off her.

37:25.895 --> 37:27.549
-Mm-hmm.
And from...

37:27.593 --> 37:28.724
Not sure
what I was going to say there.

37:28.768 --> 37:30.857
But it doesn't matter.
I'm here

37:30.900 --> 37:33.033
-and I'm rarin' to go.

37:35.644 --> 37:36.819
Hello.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.821
Hello, Mr. Wackner.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.823
Oh, that sounds cold.

37:40.867 --> 37:42.434
Am I gonna be scolded?

37:42.477 --> 37:44.087
No.

37:45.611 --> 37:47.090
What's that?

37:49.049 --> 37:50.790
-How did I earn that?
You didn't.

37:50.833 --> 37:53.619
It's what's left
of your retainer.

37:53.662 --> 37:55.621
-We're returning it.
-I hardly need

37:55.664 --> 37:57.666
pro bono representation
at this point.

37:57.710 --> 38:00.756
We are withdrawing
from representing you.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.933
We feel we have, uh,
irreconcilable differences.

38:03.977 --> 38:05.761
There are a lot of lawyers
in Chicago.

38:05.805 --> 38:08.764
Here's a list of two dozen
who are excellent

38:08.808 --> 38:11.985
and would be willing
to represent you.

38:12.028 --> 38:13.203
No, no, no.

38:13.247 --> 38:15.249
Yes, yes, yes.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.903
I trust you.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.600
You've been paid.

38:18.644 --> 38:20.646
You've received
privileged information.

38:20.689 --> 38:23.213
We're bound by attorney-client
privilege no matter what,

38:23.257 --> 38:25.868
and we will pass your files on
to any of these lawyers.

38:25.912 --> 38:27.000
No.

38:27.043 --> 38:28.697
But thank you.

38:28.741 --> 38:31.961
You prosecuted one of our
lawyers over a parking ticket.

38:32.005 --> 38:35.791
Your lawyer was released today
with time served.

38:35.835 --> 38:37.532
Compassionate release.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.273
It doesn't matter. We are
withdrawing our representation.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.840
You have no choice
in the matter.

38:40.883 --> 38:42.232
Yes, I do.

38:42.276 --> 38:43.756
I've been studying the law.

38:43.799 --> 38:45.279
I get to choose my attorney.
I choose you.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.715
Lawyers are allowed to withdraw.

38:46.759 --> 38:47.803
No.

38:47.847 --> 38:49.631
And, anyway, you've been

38:49.675 --> 38:52.199
actively seeking David Cord's
full representation.

38:52.242 --> 38:53.896
What'll he think when you guys

38:53.940 --> 38:56.812
try to drop me?
I like you guys.

38:57.770 --> 38:59.162
I don't want to lose you.

38:59.206 --> 39:00.381
Or Marissa.

39:01.426 --> 39:02.688
No hard feelings about today.

39:02.731 --> 39:03.776
It happens.

39:04.864 --> 39:06.213
Thank you.

39:08.520 --> 39:10.348
Oh, by the way,

39:10.391 --> 39:12.306
they picked up my pilot.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.481
Congratulations.

39:23.970 --> 39:26.233
