00:15.950 --> 00:18.384
- [Peter Voiceover] I
know what you're thinking.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.586
"The A Team's let themselves
go a bit, haven't they?"

00:20.588 --> 00:22.254
- Should catch something
in a bit, guys!

00:22.256 --> 00:23.489
- [Peter] That's Gaz.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.624
Not the sharpest
knife in the drawer.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.861
- Why you making it
sound like fishing for?

00:28.863 --> 00:30.029
- Well, I guess it is.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.463
- It's nothing like fishing.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.798
Nothing at all.

00:34.869 --> 00:36.135
And this is Smithy.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.271
Not so much the muscle,
more the very, very fat.

00:39.273 --> 00:43.108
- Couldn't we try and,
you know, wake him up?

00:45.312 --> 00:46.545
- This is Adam.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.114
He's just overdosed on
some pills he found.

00:49.116 --> 00:50.149
- Adam!

00:50.151 --> 00:51.717
Adam!

00:51.719 --> 00:56.021
Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam,
Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam,

00:58.592 --> 01:03.162
Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam,
Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam!

01:03.164 --> 01:04.164
And me.

01:05.132 --> 01:06.932
Hitchhiking at
the side of a road

01:06.934 --> 01:11.637
on a one-way adventure to
divorce and unrealized potential.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.173
No, I don't think he wants to.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.842
(car horn honking)

01:16.844 --> 01:19.411
- Oh, I think I've got a bite!

01:26.454 --> 01:28.087
You going anywhere
near Dewsbury?

01:28.089 --> 01:28.921
- What?

01:28.923 --> 01:29.922
- Dewsbury.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.732
(punch thuds)

01:40.734 --> 01:43.035
- [Peter] None of this
makes any sense to you.

01:43.037 --> 01:44.036
Of course it doesn't.

01:44.038 --> 01:45.771
I'd be worried if it did.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.674
(punch thuds)

01:48.676 --> 01:50.175
(punch thuds)

01:50.177 --> 01:51.877
Let's go backwards for a moment.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.580
It should all make sense then.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.215
Ah, the '80s.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.583
A different time.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.118
The hair was massive.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.286
The clothes were either too
big or just not there at all.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.489
Freddos cost only two P.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.023
Two pence!

02:05.025 --> 02:07.259
Now, you got to sell your
lung to afford a Freddo.

02:07.261 --> 02:10.395
And in a mostly failing
school in North London,

02:10.396 --> 02:12.598
five friends were out
to the show the world,

02:12.600 --> 02:15.334
in a small and ultimately
unsuccessful way,

02:15.336 --> 02:17.002
that we were a little bit cooler

02:17.004 --> 02:18.670
than everyone actually
thought we were.

02:18.672 --> 02:19.738
- I'm really not okay with this.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.572
- [Peter] That's me.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.541
Peter, the brains.

02:22.543 --> 02:25.677
Also the wet flannel,
but mostly the brains.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.546
- Stop being such a tampon.

02:27.548 --> 02:28.647
- Please, can't we
just do something else?

02:28.649 --> 02:29.815
- [Frankie] Shh!

02:29.817 --> 02:31.450
Bit noisy.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.351
Ready?

02:35.089 --> 02:36.355
- [Peter] That's Adam.

02:36.357 --> 02:38.023
Adam stapled a kid's
ear to the table once

02:38.025 --> 02:41.960
for saying his mum
lived in a caravan.

02:41.962 --> 02:45.531
- Well, another school
year is at an end.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.732
- [Peter] That's Mr. Frazer.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.066
He did used to
live in a caravan.

02:48.068 --> 02:49.801
- Are well deserved.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.771
- [Chauncey] Aw, what
have you done now?!

02:52.773 --> 02:54.006
- [Peter] Frankie.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.274
Without him, none of
us would have met.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.843
He was like the glue,
if glue had long hair

02:57.845 --> 02:59.478
and a curious obsession
with Cyndi Lauper.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.013
- [Chauncey] Did you
do that on purpose?!

03:01.015 --> 03:02.915
Look all you've done!

03:02.917 --> 03:04.983
You poured those on purpose!

03:04.985 --> 03:06.285
- [Peter] There's Gaz.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.453
He panics in maths when
he runs out of fingers.

03:08.455 --> 03:09.955
- Oh, no!

03:09.957 --> 03:11.957
- What have you done now, hey?

03:11.959 --> 03:13.559
Give me that!

03:13.561 --> 03:14.993
- This year has also seen

03:14.995 --> 03:17.629
the celebration
of our centenary.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.365
- Look at you, look at
the mess you've made.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.900
- I'm a prefect,
what if I get caught?

03:21.902 --> 03:23.635
- What's your name?
- Gaz.

03:23.637 --> 03:24.870
- Off you go.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.405
- That's right, and
what's your name?

03:26.407 --> 03:27.472
- [Young Peter] Ow!

03:27.474 --> 03:28.373
- [Chauncey] Oh, my God!

03:28.375 --> 03:30.442
- Chauncey's distracted.

03:31.612 --> 03:32.644
I'm gonna go on the lookout.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.146
Got it?
- Got it.

03:34.148 --> 03:35.581
- [Peter] And Smithy.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.149
The loveliest bloke
you'll ever meet.

03:37.151 --> 03:38.684
The only time he got in trouble

03:38.686 --> 03:41.053
was when stole a four pack of
eclairs from the corner shop.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.222
- I don't know what
I should do, though.

03:43.224 --> 03:47.426
- Look, as long as they remember
it, then it doesn't matter.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.595
- To further mark
this 100th year,

03:49.597 --> 03:52.831
we've had a
commemorative bust cast.

03:52.833 --> 03:56.468
That will be on display
in the school library.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.637
- Hey, what is his name?!

04:01.075 --> 04:03.375
Just look at the
mess you've made!

04:03.377 --> 04:05.911
(spray paint rattles)

04:05.913 --> 04:06.845
- Hi Adam!

04:06.847 --> 04:07.980
- [Peter] That's Neville.

04:07.982 --> 04:09.348
- Oh, hey.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.816
- What you up to?
- Huh?

04:10.818 --> 04:12.517
- Can I come?
- What?

04:13.687 --> 04:14.920
- [Peter] He's not
involved in this.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.421
(hand slaps)
(Neville groans)

04:16.423 --> 04:17.456
- Brilliant.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.523
See you later, then.

04:18.524 --> 04:19.825
- [Chauncey] You are
bonkers, all of you!

04:19.827 --> 04:21.159
You're bonkers!

04:21.161 --> 04:22.527
Hey?

04:22.529 --> 04:23.462
You're driving me mad!

04:25.399 --> 04:25.964
And you!

04:25.965 --> 04:26.530
Just get out of this hallway!
- Sorry.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.034
- Just get out of here, hey?!

04:33.073 --> 04:33.905
(students gasp)
(students laugh)

04:33.907 --> 04:36.975
(school bell rings)

04:39.179 --> 04:41.013
- [Young Frankie] So, what are
we doing this weekend, then?

04:41.015 --> 04:42.614
- [Gaz] Stacey Puller's
having a house party.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.982
- [Frankie] Brilliant.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.417
Everyone going?
- Yeah, if I can pull out

04:45.419 --> 04:46.818
of your mum for a
couple of hours.

04:46.820 --> 04:47.786
(car horn honking)

04:47.788 --> 04:50.489
- Come on, son!
(upbeat music)

04:50.491 --> 04:51.990
All right, lads!

04:51.992 --> 04:53.525
- Why are you wearing that?

04:53.527 --> 04:54.793
What have I done?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.295
- I'm only popping out.

04:56.297 --> 04:57.195
Come on!

04:59.166 --> 05:01.066
- See you later, boys.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.870
- Turn that shit off!

05:09.576 --> 05:10.475
All right.

05:17.284 --> 05:18.283
You coming?

05:23.691 --> 05:25.057
(liquid splashes)

05:25.059 --> 05:26.258
- Are you mad, fam?!

05:26.260 --> 05:27.693
You prick, bruv!

05:27.695 --> 05:28.860
You're lucky I don't
call my brother down here

05:28.862 --> 05:30.095
to come and stab you up!

05:30.097 --> 05:32.531
- [Peter Voiceover]
Ah, the 21st century.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.966
Russia is still the
aggressive drunk at the party,

05:34.968 --> 05:37.135
the government's fucking
up all over the place,

05:37.137 --> 05:38.570
everybody's poor,

05:38.572 --> 05:41.173
and Madonna is making
everyone feel uncomfortable.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.074
- Pagan!

05:44.144 --> 05:45.677
(school bell rings)

05:45.679 --> 05:47.312
- Remember.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.448
So, mocks tomorrow.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.949
See you all then.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.735
(door thuds)

06:20.214 --> 06:25.050
("When He Gets You
Down" by The Roscoes)

06:28.756 --> 06:30.889
- [Peter Voiceover] It's
funny how things turn out.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.158
Oxford turned out to
be Southend College,

06:33.160 --> 06:35.727
and four brilliant years of
education and life lessons

06:35.729 --> 06:38.330
turned out to be three
years of fucking torment.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.966
Party politics turned
into event management,

06:40.968 --> 06:42.434
and any hope of any success

06:42.436 --> 06:44.736
turned into a decade of
teaching grunting teenagers

06:44.738 --> 06:48.340
in the same school that I spent
five years itching to leave.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.976
It's funny how things turn out.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.445
Absolutely fucking hilarious.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.618
(people murmuring)

07:01.622 --> 07:02.921
- Mr. Hudders.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.356
- Sorry. Sorry, everyone.

07:04.358 --> 07:05.390
- [Principle Saunders]
Rough morning?

07:05.392 --> 07:06.291
- Um. No.

07:07.394 --> 07:08.827
(chuckles)

07:08.829 --> 07:09.761
Jazz again.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.329
She's so spirited.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.533
Everyone okay?

07:14.535 --> 07:16.034
- Mrs. Saxon.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.369
- Ah, yes--
- Oh, sorry, just before

07:17.371 --> 07:18.570
I forget, we should discuss
history term project--

07:18.572 --> 07:19.471
- No!

07:20.541 --> 07:22.874
There is an agenda!

07:22.876 --> 07:25.043
An agenda, I'm
sorry to say, Peter,

07:25.045 --> 07:28.213
that was written out
before you arrived.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.082
You simply can't bully
your way in here--

07:31.084 --> 07:32.384
- Bully?
- And demand that things

07:32.386 --> 07:34.219
that you want to be discussed

07:34.221 --> 07:38.690
be put at the top of the
Things To Be Discussed List!

07:41.061 --> 07:41.960
- Sorry?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.230
- Next on the agenda

07:45.232 --> 07:49.768
is the end of term assembly
tomorrow afternoon.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.871
Would anyone like to
make a little speech?

07:52.873 --> 07:55.240
- I'm out.
- Peter, why don't you do it?

07:55.242 --> 07:56.708
- I don't think, I think
someone else this time--

07:56.710 --> 08:00.512
- You know, I've always admired
your speaking voice, Peter.

08:00.514 --> 08:01.446
- Same.

08:01.448 --> 08:02.981
It's got a sort of drone to it.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.718
- Drone?
- A sort of pleading to it.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.954
- Eventually, people just
listen to you out of pity.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.222
- I actually don't
want to do it.

08:10.224 --> 08:11.223
- That's sorted, then.

08:11.225 --> 08:12.491
Cheers, Peter.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.027
- Right, so, I've been thinking.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.729
We've been together a while now.

08:17.731 --> 08:20.899
Only, I think we've sort
of grown up differently.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.401
I need testosterone, you know?

08:23.403 --> 08:27.539
And you're, well, you're
just a bit too estrogen.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.742
I knew you'd understand.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.577
- No, sorry, I don't.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.250
Are you leaving me?

08:38.251 --> 08:39.083
- What?

08:39.086 --> 08:40.619
No!

08:40.621 --> 08:42.020
Why would you think that?!

08:42.022 --> 08:44.222
- Oh, just for a moment, I--
- You're leaving me.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.790
I've packed your bags.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.192
Sorry.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.694
I just don't think
you're man enough for me.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.962
- You're telling me to leave?

08:50.964 --> 08:52.197
- I know.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.965
But, you know, new beginnings.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.434
It'll be good for both of us.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.808
(lightning crackles)

09:10.784 --> 09:13.652
Bags are at the
top of the stairs.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.787
- We've been married
nearly 10 years.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.989
- Yeah, it was nice.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.691
Thanks, and everything.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.493
- We were gonna try for a baby.

09:21.495 --> 09:22.494
(chuckles)

09:22.496 --> 09:24.396
- Mental, wasn't it?

09:24.398 --> 09:27.332
But I think we can
stay friends, yeah?

09:27.334 --> 09:29.734
- I work to pay
rent for this house.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.536
You don't do anything.

09:31.538 --> 09:32.904
You leave!

09:32.906 --> 09:33.805
You...

09:35.409 --> 09:36.308
Trollop!

09:39.746 --> 09:42.581
(door slams)
(groans)

09:42.583 --> 09:44.149
- [Peter Voiceover] Being
stuck in an unhappy marriage

09:44.151 --> 09:46.084
is a lot like being
stuck in quicksand.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.652
Well, people think that
if you kick your legs

09:47.654 --> 09:50.722
and make a fuss, you'll sink
more quickly and you'll die,

09:50.724 --> 09:52.257
but that's just a myth.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.593
Most people are too tall
to be completely swallowed.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.829
And, well, like a
marriage, well...

09:57.831 --> 09:59.164
Oh.

09:59.166 --> 10:02.167
I completely forgot
what my point was.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.970
(loudly snoring)

10:06.640 --> 10:09.641
(marker squeaking)

10:16.950 --> 10:18.450
- Oh, no.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.218
This, for the lesson, a
graphical representation--

10:20.220 --> 10:22.787
- I don't want to know, Peter.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.693
- Not bad.

10:28.695 --> 10:31.830
- Hello, what can I do for you?

10:31.832 --> 10:33.531
- Peter Hudders.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.800
You haven't changed a bit.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.637
Well, you're older, obviously.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.206
- I'm sorry, I don't...

10:41.208 --> 10:42.107
Richard?!

10:43.710 --> 10:45.377
- How are you, son?
- Yeah, fine.

10:45.379 --> 10:48.747
God, I thought you'd
be dead by now.

10:48.749 --> 10:49.648
- Not yet.

10:51.718 --> 10:52.951
(sighs)

10:52.953 --> 10:53.818
Not yet.

11:00.060 --> 11:00.892
How's things?

11:00.894 --> 11:02.093
- Yeah, fine. Great.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.328
Well, how are you?

11:03.330 --> 11:04.295
- I've got piles.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.830
- Oh.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.565
- Have you ever accidentally
sat on one of your balls?

11:07.567 --> 11:09.000
- Can't say I have, no.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.703
- Well, that's what
piles are like.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.371
- Lovely to see you.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.239
Brilliant.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.574
What do you want?

11:17.778 --> 11:19.444
- You've not asked
how Frankie is.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.513
- I spoke to Frankie
not long ago.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.981
- A phone call?

11:22.983 --> 11:24.916
Two years ago?

11:24.918 --> 11:26.384
Not like when you were younger.

11:26.386 --> 11:29.254
You'd need a crowbar to
separate you lot back then.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.655
- How's Frankie?

11:34.394 --> 11:35.226
- Dying.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.594
- What?

11:36.596 --> 11:37.495
- Cancer.

11:38.532 --> 11:39.531
Testicular.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.468
They say he's not
that long left.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.369
- Shit.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.138
- Shit indeed, my boy.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.341
Frankie sent me.

11:50.343 --> 11:51.810
He wants to see you again.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.778
- Me?
- All of you.

11:53.780 --> 11:56.448
Adam, Smithy, Gaz,
the lot of you.

11:56.450 --> 11:57.716
Don't know why.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.484
Never really liked any of you.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.153
- I can't just up
and leave, Richard.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.155
I've got work, I've got a wife.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.858
- That'd be why you're camping
out in your classroom, is it?

12:06.860 --> 12:08.927
- Okay, well, things aren't
great for me right now,

12:08.929 --> 12:12.097
but I'm sorry,
Richard, I'm busy.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.432
I haven't seen the
others for years.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.334
- About time for a little
reunion, then, I'd say.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.404
- Richard--
- He's got a week, Peter,

12:21.007 --> 12:23.241
and that's if we're lucky.

12:27.814 --> 12:30.148
I'd hurry up if I were you.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.186
His address.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.522
He moved up north
a few years ago.

12:37.524 --> 12:38.890
Dewsbury.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.391
God knows why.

12:40.393 --> 12:43.461
Stinks of cow shit,
but he likes it.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.002
A week, Peter.

12:55.942 --> 12:56.875
- [Peter Voiceover]
When you're a kid,

12:56.877 --> 12:58.343
you assume you'll live forever.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.944
That doesn't last long.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.412
Sooner or later, you
realize none of us

13:01.414 --> 13:02.881
are here for very long.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.315
- Shit.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.283
- [Peter Voiceover]
And after that,

13:05.285 --> 13:06.584
whether you realize it or not,

13:06.586 --> 13:09.587
you try and try to push
it into the corners.

13:09.589 --> 13:12.223
Focus on today,
focus on the weekend

13:12.225 --> 13:15.193
or the next holiday
until you forget.

13:15.195 --> 13:19.330
But then forgetting doesn't
last very long either.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.968
And, kids, that's why God
invented cheap whiskey.

13:23.970 --> 13:24.936
- Ah.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.771
Knock yourselves out.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.678
(loudly belches)

13:33.680 --> 13:34.979
Speech.

13:34.981 --> 13:35.880
Speech.

13:38.919 --> 13:39.784
No speech.

13:39.786 --> 13:40.685
Um.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.558
Oh.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.159
Oh, yeah.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.060
Work hard.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.164
Work hard, guys!

13:53.166 --> 13:56.367
Work hard, it's all you can do!

13:56.369 --> 14:01.439
If you work hard, you can get
a really good job and stuff,

14:02.242 --> 14:03.474
and you won't have to come back

14:03.476 --> 14:06.177
to the same dump of a
school that you went to.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.579
(chuckles)

14:07.581 --> 14:10.381
I'm only here 'cause
nobody else could be assed!

14:10.383 --> 14:11.950
(laughs)

14:11.952 --> 14:16.788
Now, one time, I thought this
was a particularly nice place,

14:16.790 --> 14:18.957
but I think that was a weekend.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.426
(students laugh)

14:21.428 --> 14:24.662
- I think that's
quite enough, Peter!

14:24.664 --> 14:26.497
- No, I'm fine!

14:26.499 --> 14:27.432
I'm fine!
(students laugh)

14:27.434 --> 14:28.766
Oh, don't listen to me, kids.

14:28.768 --> 14:29.667
Listen...

14:30.537 --> 14:32.770
Do you know what, kids?

14:32.772 --> 14:37.842
Election says why does everybody
have to be such an asshole?

14:38.378 --> 14:39.043
(students laugh)

14:39.045 --> 14:39.978
An asshole!

14:39.980 --> 14:40.845
Asshole.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.213
Asshole!

14:42.215 --> 14:44.282
Don't, asshole!
- Get your things, Peter!

14:44.284 --> 14:45.216
You're fired!

14:45.218 --> 14:46.618
- Fired?! Fired, am I?!

14:46.620 --> 14:49.254
You can't fire me,
because I quit!

14:49.256 --> 14:50.655
I quit and good luck!

14:50.657 --> 14:51.689
- [Peter Voiceover]
Life has its little ways

14:51.691 --> 14:53.091
of showing you the way.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.126
It's easy if you know
how to spot the signs,

14:55.128 --> 14:57.462
but most of the time, the
signs are poxy little things

14:57.464 --> 14:58.796
in complimentary fortune cookies

14:58.798 --> 15:00.265
written by a
seven-year-old North Korean

15:00.267 --> 15:02.333
on a zero-hour contract.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.904
In this case, the sign was
pretty straight forward.

15:05.906 --> 15:09.140
(loudly moaning)
(loud rattling)

15:09.142 --> 15:10.675
And my nan used to say,

15:10.677 --> 15:13.511
"When the universe
calls, answer the phone."

15:13.513 --> 15:16.447
("Start Again" by The Roscoes)

15:16.449 --> 15:18.416
Well, she didn't say it.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.817
She wrote it down.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.819
And by that time, she
was totally insane,

15:21.821 --> 15:23.688
so she'd written
it in her own shit.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.491
But it's the
thought that counts.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.296
(loudly moaning)
(loud rattling)

15:31.298 --> 15:33.031
- Shit, man.

15:33.033 --> 15:36.868
I only spoke to him
a few months ago.

15:36.870 --> 15:38.436
He didn't say anything.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.271
- So, you'll come, then?

15:40.273 --> 15:41.205
- I don't know, mate.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.340
It might be a bit tricky.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.875
- Why?
(door thuds)

15:43.877 --> 15:44.943
- Oh, hello!

15:46.746 --> 15:50.615
Didn't say we had
have visitors, Garry.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.450
- Sorry, this is Peter.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.619
He's an old mate from school.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.553
- Oh.
- Yeah.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.221
- Nice to meet you.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.224
- Yeah.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.527
This is Elle.

16:02.529 --> 16:03.594
Say hello, darling.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.663
(Gaz chuckles)

16:05.665 --> 16:06.831
- Your baby, Gaz.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.499
- Yeah.
- Your.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.767
Bless.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.803
- Yeah, she'll be two
in a couple of months.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.405
Right happy little
family, we are, yeah.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.074
- Oh, she's so tiny.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.477
(Elle laughs)

16:19.479 --> 16:21.946
(chuckles)

16:21.948 --> 16:23.348
You've been holiday recently?

16:23.350 --> 16:24.248
- Oh, no.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.551
We wish.

16:26.553 --> 16:27.452
No, no.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.655
Stacey says that
happens sometimes.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.156
- Did she?
- Yeah.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.127
So, going away for a while
might be a bit tricky, mate.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.929
Can't leave Stace on
her own, now, can I?

16:37.931 --> 16:39.931
- [Stacey] What's that?

16:41.067 --> 16:42.834
- One of our mates
ain't well, babe.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.703
In fact, he ain't got long left.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.438
Pete was saying we
should go and see him.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.940
- Oh, no.

16:48.942 --> 16:50.775
Aww, that's sad, hey?

16:51.578 --> 16:52.810
Well, you should go, babe.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.045
I'll be all right.

16:54.047 --> 16:54.946
- Are you sure?

16:54.948 --> 16:56.214
- Yeah, yeah!

16:56.216 --> 16:58.783
You should go see
your friend, hey?

16:58.785 --> 17:00.518
I'll find someone to occupy me.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.419
(loudly gurgles)

17:01.421 --> 17:02.820
Or something!
(laughs)

17:02.822 --> 17:03.654
Not someone!

17:03.656 --> 17:05.823
Oh, what am I like, hey?

17:05.825 --> 17:07.959
(laughs)

17:10.195 --> 17:12.430
- [Peter] While Gaz was
busy playing happy families,

17:12.432 --> 17:15.299
Adam had abandoned his
quest for porn celebrity,

17:15.300 --> 17:17.468
but he moved into the
world of banking instead.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.637
This way, he could
screw even more people.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.839
- Mr. Woods has canceled
all his appointments today.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.776
I can book you for tomorrow.

17:24.778 --> 17:25.710
- We're old friends.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.145
If you just tell him our names,

17:27.146 --> 17:28.846
I'm sure he'll want to see us.

17:28.848 --> 17:29.747
- Okay.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.852
(phone ringing)

17:38.324 --> 17:39.791
Mr. Woods, I've got--

17:39.793 --> 17:44.395
- I don't give two fucking
useless sacks of runny shit--

17:44.931 --> 17:47.365
(phone clacks)

17:47.367 --> 17:50.034
- I think we should just go up.

17:54.908 --> 17:55.973
(elevator chimes)

17:55.975 --> 17:58.209
- [Elevator] Doors opened.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.949
- He seemed really angry, Pete.

18:04.951 --> 18:08.686
- Well, it's nice to
know he hasn't changed.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.056
(knocking)

18:12.058 --> 18:12.957
Adam?

18:13.893 --> 18:15.259
It's Peter.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.260
(knocking)

18:16.262 --> 18:17.161
- And Gaz.

18:18.164 --> 18:19.397
- From school.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.233
Are you all right?

18:28.374 --> 18:30.641
- Maybe he's having
a moment to himself.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.876
- What?

18:31.878 --> 18:33.377
- Well, Stace does
that sometimes.

18:33.379 --> 18:36.214
When she gets stressed out,
she goes away for a few days.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.316
And when she comes back,
she's much happier.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.784
- You know, Gaz,

18:39.786 --> 18:44.088
we need to have a little chat
about that at some point.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.189
(knocking)

18:45.191 --> 18:46.090
Adam?

18:48.061 --> 18:49.460
We're coming in.

18:50.864 --> 18:52.396
Fucking hell!
- Jesus!

18:52.398 --> 18:55.900
(frantic rock music)

18:55.902 --> 18:58.336
- Quick, get something
to cut him down with!

18:58.338 --> 18:59.337
It's all right, Adam!

18:59.339 --> 19:01.105
I've got you! I've got you!

19:01.107 --> 19:02.073
- Fuck off!

19:09.482 --> 19:10.648
- It's not working!

19:10.650 --> 19:12.717
- You fucking phlegm sacks!

19:12.719 --> 19:13.951
- What is it?!

19:15.688 --> 19:16.654
- A spoon!

19:16.656 --> 19:18.890
- Oh, for fuck's sake!

19:18.892 --> 19:20.091
(groans)

19:20.093 --> 19:22.660
(tense music)

19:34.807 --> 19:35.706
- What?

19:38.378 --> 19:39.844
(Adam sighs)

19:39.846 --> 19:41.679
I don't know what you're
getting so worked up about!

19:41.681 --> 19:43.748
- You were gonna
to kill yourself!

19:43.750 --> 19:45.750
- So what, people
do it all the time!

19:45.752 --> 19:47.685
- But why would
you even try that?!

19:47.687 --> 19:50.788
I mean, it can never
be as bad as that!

19:50.790 --> 19:52.323
- Fuck me!

19:52.325 --> 19:54.492
You would too if you had my job.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.360
They're trying to pin
me for fraud, Peter.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.962
I mean, since when is
signing other people's names

19:57.964 --> 19:59.797
on documents been
considered fraudulent?

19:59.799 --> 20:01.499
- Quite a while, I think, Adam.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.533
(groans)

20:02.535 --> 20:04.669
They're all fuckers, bankers.

20:04.671 --> 20:05.836
They haven't got
a single fucking

20:05.838 --> 20:07.738
brain cell between them.
- Oh, shit!

20:07.740 --> 20:08.573
My eye.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.540
Ah!

20:09.542 --> 20:10.675
I'm blind!

20:10.677 --> 20:13.678
Ah!
- Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.046
(phone buzzing)

20:15.048 --> 20:18.716
And this fucking thing
never fucking stops!

20:22.755 --> 20:26.591
Connors, listen to me
you fucking fanny clot!

20:27.927 --> 20:30.294
If you ever call me on
this fucking number again,

20:30.296 --> 20:32.430
so help me, God, I
will find the address

20:32.432 --> 20:34.198
of your first-born's school

20:34.200 --> 20:36.434
and I will fly a
fucking airbus into it

20:36.436 --> 20:39.904
first thing Monday
fucking morning!

20:39.906 --> 20:41.138
Now, fuck off!

20:48.081 --> 20:52.683
Well, what can I do for you
two clownish sponges anyway?

20:52.685 --> 20:54.719
(sighs)

20:56.422 --> 20:57.955
- Frankie's dying.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.867
- That's not good.

21:09.869 --> 21:13.037
- He might not last the week.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.972
His dad came to see me.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.009
Frankie wants to see us.

21:20.213 --> 21:24.882
- Well, it's either that or
I very probably go to jail.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.251
I call shotgun.

21:27.253 --> 21:29.887
(gentle music)

21:31.491 --> 21:33.291
- [Peter Voiceover]
Smithy was harder to find.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.660
No one had heard from
him for a few years.

21:35.662 --> 21:39.530
And where do you go when a
middle-aged man disappears?

21:39.532 --> 21:41.032
His mother's.

21:41.034 --> 21:42.833
- I never thought I'd
see you boys again.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.435
(cuckoo clock whistling)

21:44.437 --> 21:45.970
(cat mews)

21:45.972 --> 21:48.606
Smithy said he's not
seen you in a long while.

21:48.608 --> 21:51.575
- One of our friends has
cancer, Mrs. Meadows.

21:51.577 --> 21:53.044
You remember Frankie?

21:53.046 --> 21:54.845
- Oh, that's a shame.

21:56.215 --> 21:58.282
He was the handsome one.

21:58.284 --> 21:59.483
I remember.

21:59.485 --> 22:02.453
- So, we were all going
to go and see him.

22:02.455 --> 22:03.988
Together.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.924
But because we've not seen
Smithy for such a long time,

22:06.926 --> 22:09.026
we sort of don't
know where to look.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.795
- He's at the pub tonight.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.396
He's on a date.

22:12.398 --> 22:14.031
- A what?

22:14.033 --> 22:16.434
- And I was really
nervous about tonight.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.435
- So, what do you do?

22:17.437 --> 22:20.071
- I work with Sild Chervice...

22:20.073 --> 22:21.072
Child services.

22:21.074 --> 22:22.139
- No way!

22:22.141 --> 22:23.374
I was a foster kid!

22:23.376 --> 22:24.709
- Oh, were you?

22:25.878 --> 22:27.712
You weren't one of the
abused kids, were you?

22:27.714 --> 22:30.281
'Cause there is a lot of them.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.284
(bell rings)

22:33.286 --> 22:34.285
- Exactly.

22:34.287 --> 22:35.886
I mean, how hard is it?

22:35.888 --> 22:37.555
The economy has to work.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.790
If not, we're just
working our asses off,

22:39.792 --> 22:41.692
waiting for the
debt swallow us up!

22:41.694 --> 22:43.094
And what would that make us?

22:43.096 --> 22:43.961
Greek?!

22:43.963 --> 22:46.097
(laughs)

22:51.537 --> 22:52.370
- Greek.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.505
(laughs)

23:03.015 --> 23:03.848
(bell rings)

23:03.850 --> 23:06.884
(upbeat rock music)

23:12.992 --> 23:15.593
(bell ringing)

23:17.597 --> 23:19.263
- All right, fatty?

23:23.703 --> 23:25.536
- I can't believe it.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.373
I thought Frankie
would live forever.

23:29.375 --> 23:30.274
- I know.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.376
So, you'll come, then?

23:32.378 --> 23:34.278
We'll get a coach first
thing tomorrow morning.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.880
- A fucking coach?

23:35.882 --> 23:37.681
I am not getting
on a fucking coach.

23:37.683 --> 23:38.916
What's wrong with your car?!

23:38.918 --> 23:40.918
- Chelsea's taking it.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.386
So, you'll come, then?

23:42.388 --> 23:44.054
- Yeah, definitely.

23:46.626 --> 23:47.525
Jesus.

23:49.195 --> 23:52.129
- Well, that's sorted, then.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.465
Ladies, raise your glasses.

23:56.669 --> 23:57.601
To Frankie.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.437
- [Group] To Frankie.

24:07.847 --> 24:10.681
- Makes you think, doesn't it?

24:10.683 --> 24:12.883
Everything's so temporary.

24:14.487 --> 24:15.653
Nothing lasts.

24:16.756 --> 24:19.423
Whatever you do,
whatever you say,

24:20.793 --> 24:24.462
it means nothing 'cause
it all comes down to this.

24:25.431 --> 24:27.064
Friends, memories--

24:27.967 --> 24:28.799
(beer splashes)
(groans)

24:28.801 --> 24:30.167
- Just shut up.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.303
(coughs)

24:32.305 --> 24:35.306
Barman, eight pints, twelve
shots, a yard of White Ace,

24:35.308 --> 24:37.475
and whatever these
wank bags are having.

fucking walked home, did I?!

25:13.713 --> 25:16.480
It's not West Side
fucking Story!

25:17.850 --> 25:19.750
No, I haven't seen it!

25:21.320 --> 25:23.120
No, I won't be late.

25:23.122 --> 25:26.590
Yes, I'll be there on
time, oh, fuck off!

25:32.498 --> 25:34.732
- Good evening, Mr. Woods.

25:36.602 --> 25:37.501
- Yslav!

25:38.437 --> 25:39.670
Dolohov.

25:39.672 --> 25:40.905
What is it, six months?

25:40.907 --> 25:42.439
God, doesn't time fly?!

25:42.441 --> 25:43.941
(chuckles)

25:43.943 --> 25:48.379
You're probably here
about the money, but I--

25:48.381 --> 25:50.714
- Eight months, Mr. Woods.

25:50.716 --> 25:51.615
Eight!

25:53.252 --> 25:55.119
We waited for your call.

25:55.121 --> 25:58.956
We hear nothing, so
we come find you.

25:58.958 --> 26:01.458
And we told you we would
if you played with us.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.360
(shrieks)

26:03.362 --> 26:07.164
Final demand, last
warning, and final demand.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.870
You do not have my
money, Mr. Woods.

26:12.872 --> 26:15.105
And I think that you don't
want to give it back!

26:15.107 --> 26:16.373
- What?! God, no!

26:16.375 --> 26:18.976
No, look, just take
me to the cashpoint!

26:18.978 --> 26:20.244
I've got it--
- You will not go

26:20.246 --> 26:21.946
to the cashpoint, Mr. Woods!

26:21.948 --> 26:26.850
You knew what would happen if
I did not get my money back!

26:34.860 --> 26:36.894
- What? What did he say?!

26:36.896 --> 26:37.962
What's he saying?!

26:37.964 --> 26:39.029
What's happening?!

26:39.031 --> 26:39.863
What are you doing?!

26:39.865 --> 26:42.132
I've got the money!

26:42.134 --> 26:43.400
No need for this!

26:43.402 --> 26:46.270
I've got the money,
I've got the money!

27:18.638 --> 27:21.271
(phone chimes)

27:34.487 --> 27:36.787
- [Peter] This is terrible idea.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.856
(Smithy groans)

27:38.858 --> 27:42.760
- I'm too old for all of this.
(tires screech)

27:42.762 --> 27:43.994
- Well, we made it on time.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.295
- About fucking time.

27:45.297 --> 27:48.399
Ridiculous, just
fucking ridiculous!

27:48.401 --> 27:50.000
I might just well
have fucking walked,

27:50.002 --> 27:51.135
seeing as you can't drive

27:51.137 --> 27:53.170
more than nine
fucking miles an hour!

27:53.172 --> 27:55.072
Fucking waste of skin.

28:00.746 --> 28:03.213
- Was that really necessary?

28:03.215 --> 28:05.215
- Absolutely not.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.151
- Do you even know her name?

28:07.153 --> 28:08.852
- Why does that matter?

28:08.854 --> 28:10.888
Anyway, where's Gaz?

28:10.890 --> 28:12.556
- [Gaz] Oh, Jesus Christ.

28:12.558 --> 28:13.991
- [Adam] The fuck's
wrong with you?

28:13.993 --> 28:17.661
- Oh, must've been
that kebab last night.

28:17.663 --> 28:18.562
Oh, Jesus.

28:20.399 --> 28:21.832
(groans)

28:21.834 --> 28:24.168
There's a toilet on
the coach, ain't there?

28:24.170 --> 28:25.469
- Yes, son.

28:25.471 --> 28:26.670
- Brilliant.
- Yours to use

28:26.672 --> 28:28.839
for just 20 P a go.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.974
- 20 P to use the toilet?

28:32.078 --> 28:33.911
That's extortion!

28:33.913 --> 28:35.379
- Don't know what
that means, mate,

28:35.381 --> 28:37.514
but feel free to stick your
wang out of the window.

28:37.516 --> 28:38.916
Some have tried.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.317
Some have even
managed not to have it

28:40.319 --> 28:42.553
knocked off by a passing truck.

28:42.555 --> 28:45.789
Right, then, ladies
and gents, all aboard!

28:49.128 --> 28:51.862
(phone chiming)

28:54.233 --> 28:55.499
- Hello?
- Good morning,

28:55.501 --> 28:56.500
is that Mr. Peter
Hudders speaking?

28:56.502 --> 28:57.701
- Yes, speaking.

28:57.703 --> 28:59.036
- [Jodie] Just a
quick courtesy call

28:59.038 --> 28:59.970
to see if you were
interested in a limited range

28:59.972 --> 29:00.904
of super cheap life insurance.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.172
- No, I'm not interested.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.373
Thank you.
- I'm sorry to hear that,

29:03.375 --> 29:04.341
Mr. Hudders, perhaps
we could interest you--

29:04.343 --> 29:06.276
- No, no, I said no.

29:06.278 --> 29:07.611
Right, I'm disconnecting.

29:07.613 --> 29:10.247
Okay, right, I'm disconnecting.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.282
- Who was that?

29:12.284 --> 29:13.751
- Salespeople.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.452
God knows where they
get their numbers from.

29:15.454 --> 29:19.123
- Oh, well, they collect
them on a huge database.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.591
And it's not just phone numbers.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.559
Texts, internet searches.

29:22.561 --> 29:23.794
- That's not true, is it?

29:23.795 --> 29:25.028
- It is, it is, it is.
- It isn't, it isn't,

29:25.030 --> 29:26.430
it isn't, it isn't.
- It is, it is,

29:26.432 --> 29:27.731
it is, it is, it is.
- It isn't, it isn't,

29:27.733 --> 29:28.766
it isn't, it isn't!
- It is!

29:28.768 --> 29:29.700
- It isn't!
- It is!

29:29.702 --> 29:30.634
- It isn't.
- It is.

29:30.636 --> 29:31.935
- Isn't.
- But it is.

29:33.939 --> 29:37.007
So, I'd watch out if I were you.

29:37.009 --> 29:39.877
(phone chiming)

29:39.879 --> 29:41.312
- [Jodie] Good morning,
it's Jodie calling

29:41.313 --> 29:42.746
from Fast Connection where
getting you the number one deal--

29:42.748 --> 29:44.414
- Yeah, you just called.

29:44.416 --> 29:45.616
I'm not interested.

29:45.618 --> 29:46.717
- [Jodie] It's just
a courtesy call

29:46.719 --> 29:48.152
to see if you're interested
in our super cheap

29:48.154 --> 29:49.453
range of loft insulation.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.933
- What have you done?

30:02.935 --> 30:03.834
- Nothing.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.508
Toilet wouldn't flush.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.644
(both chuckle)

30:13.646 --> 30:15.946
- He's emptied his wringer
like a fat carol singer.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.181
(both laugh)

30:17.183 --> 30:19.249
He's at an ass staff
from his doner kebab.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.385
(laughs)

30:21.387 --> 30:23.020
He's left a platter
of splatter matter.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.822
(Smithy laughs)

30:24.824 --> 30:27.090
He had a close encounter
with the turd kind.

30:27.092 --> 30:28.725
(laughs)

30:28.727 --> 30:30.160
- Excellent.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.728
I need to pee too,
for fuck's sake!

30:31.730 --> 30:34.331
(both laugh)

30:34.333 --> 30:35.599
Does it smell?

30:38.037 --> 30:40.771
(Smithy laughs)

30:46.312 --> 30:47.945
(groans)

30:47.947 --> 30:48.846
Oh, God!

30:50.049 --> 30:50.914
Oh!

30:50.916 --> 30:51.949
Oh, no.

30:51.951 --> 30:52.816
No, okay.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.353
Okay.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.688
Oh, God.

30:57.690 --> 30:58.589
Oh, God--
(phone chiming)

30:58.591 --> 30:59.890
Oh, for fuck's sake.

30:59.892 --> 31:01.091
(coughs)

31:01.093 --> 31:02.292
Bloody what?!

31:02.293 --> 31:03.492
- [Jodie] Sorry about that,
sir, we seemed to have lost you

31:03.495 --> 31:04.878
during that last call.

31:04.879 --> 31:06.262
Just a quick call to see
if you were interested in

31:06.265 --> 31:07.464
a special deal of
wholesale crotch rub.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.032
- I don't want
fucking crotch rub!

31:09.034 --> 31:10.200
- [Jodie] Right,
no problem, sir.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.802
Now, would you be interested
in a special deal, sir,

31:11.804 --> 31:13.403
where we provide a
25% reimbursement--

31:13.405 --> 31:14.771
- Just fuck off!

31:15.841 --> 31:16.707
25%?

31:19.912 --> 31:20.844
That's pretty good.

31:20.846 --> 31:22.079
That's pretty good, actually.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.313
Yeah, no, no, no, no,
no, say more, say more.

31:23.315 --> 31:27.117
Yeah, no, so, yeah, I
have recently become

31:27.119 --> 31:30.587
in need of a new house, so
go on, go on, go on, yeah--

31:30.589 --> 31:32.256
- [Jodie] Our show home
scheme is just six viewings

31:32.258 --> 31:34.124
every two months.
- Right, yes, fine, yes.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.058
Six?

31:35.060 --> 31:36.093
- [Jodie] Indeed, just six.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.327
- That's great, go on, yeah--

31:37.329 --> 31:38.462
- [Jodie] You sound
quite interested, sir.

31:38.464 --> 31:39.396
Could I possibly
arrange for you to call

31:39.398 --> 31:40.697
our show home department

31:40.699 --> 31:43.033
at a time convenient for you?
- Yes, yes, yes.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.234
What do I need to do--
(loud rumble)

31:44.236 --> 31:45.435
(phone clacks)
(loud splat)

31:45.437 --> 31:46.770
- [Jodie] You don't need
to do anything, sir.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.005
(Peter whimpers)

31:48.007 --> 31:49.640
I'll just find the
number for you now.

31:49.642 --> 31:51.208
(dramatic music)

31:51.210 --> 31:52.609
- Yes, quickly, yes!

31:52.611 --> 31:53.627
Quickly, quickly--

31:53.628 --> 31:54.644
- [Jodie] Going as
fast as I can, sir.

31:54.647 --> 31:56.079
- But, wait, wait!

31:57.049 --> 31:58.548
(coughing)

31:58.550 --> 31:59.783
Quickly!
- I'm sorry, sir,

31:59.785 --> 32:00.751
but there is a
protocol to follow

32:00.753 --> 32:02.352
and I am yet to find
the number for you.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.587
If you would please
just be patient--

32:03.589 --> 32:05.989
- Oh, God, I do not
have time to be patient!

32:05.991 --> 32:07.491
(loud bubbling)

32:07.493 --> 32:10.494
You are slowly sinking
into a runny pile of shit!

32:10.496 --> 32:12.362
(groans)
- Ah, here it is, sir.

32:12.364 --> 32:15.299
Number is 0800-634-7754.
- Wait!

32:15.301 --> 32:16.566
No!

32:16.568 --> 32:17.401
- [Jodie] Would you like
me to reread the number?

32:17.403 --> 32:18.635
- Yes, yes!

32:18.637 --> 32:21.738
- Certainly, sir,
it's 0800-634--

32:21.740 --> 32:22.940
- No, no!

32:22.942 --> 32:24.942
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

32:24.944 --> 32:25.842
Oh, God!

32:26.679 --> 32:27.577
Oh, no!

32:30.082 --> 32:32.783
(breathing loudly)

32:32.785 --> 32:33.817
Oh, God!

32:33.819 --> 32:34.885
Oh, God!

32:34.887 --> 32:36.286
Shit.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.187
Oh, shit.

32:38.257 --> 32:39.156
Oh, shit.

32:46.632 --> 32:47.464
Oh, God.

32:47.466 --> 32:48.365
Oh, God.

32:52.705 --> 32:56.173
(Adam sniffing)

32:56.175 --> 32:58.075
- You were ages, mate.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.879
- Jesus Christ, why the
fuck do I smell ass diesel?!

33:02.881 --> 33:04.314
- It wasn't me!

33:04.316 --> 33:06.116
- Oh, mate, it's you.

33:09.421 --> 33:10.554
- You didn't.

33:12.257 --> 33:14.224
- Jesus Christ, Peter!

33:14.226 --> 33:16.393
- Don't worry, mate.

33:16.395 --> 33:19.262
Smell probably goes
away in a little while.

33:19.264 --> 33:20.163
- Yeah.

33:27.639 --> 33:30.440
(softly snoring)

33:35.080 --> 33:35.912
Come on.

33:35.914 --> 33:36.913
We're here.

33:42.054 --> 33:44.788
Right, so, little issue.

33:44.790 --> 33:47.190
We're meant to be in Dewsbury.

33:47.192 --> 33:48.091
- Yes?

33:49.828 --> 33:51.828
- We're not in Dewsbury.

33:51.830 --> 33:52.729
- No?

33:53.599 --> 33:55.265
- We're in Chester.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.634
(Adam chuckles)

33:57.636 --> 33:58.535
- Chester.

33:59.405 --> 34:00.604
Chester.

34:00.606 --> 34:03.507
Chester, as in that
little slice of England

34:03.509 --> 34:05.742
that no one gives a
fucking shit about!

34:05.744 --> 34:06.877
- Actually, it's meant
to be quite a nice--

34:06.879 --> 34:08.110
- As in Chester
there's miles and miles

34:08.112 --> 34:09.946
the fucking away from Dewsbury!

34:09.947 --> 34:10.981
- We are where we are.

34:10.983 --> 34:12.616
We're not that far away, so--

34:12.618 --> 34:14.551
- So, what are we gonna do now?

34:14.553 --> 34:15.985
- It's late.

34:15.987 --> 34:17.987
We should find a hotel.

34:17.989 --> 34:19.056
- Hotel, is it?

34:19.058 --> 34:20.690
You want The Nip Slip.

34:20.692 --> 34:21.858
Doris is a good friend of mine.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.793
She'll see you right.

34:23.795 --> 34:26.496
Fairbrother Street, 10
minutes up the road.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.864
- Oh, cheers, mate.

34:28.867 --> 34:31.234
- You lot haven't
changed, have you?

34:31.235 --> 34:34.638
Just all the same useless
cunts you were at school!

34:34.639 --> 34:37.274
(gentle music)

34:38.976 --> 34:41.945
- [Peter Voiceover] A moron,
a semi-suicidal tosser,

34:41.947 --> 34:44.547
me with my shitty arm, and
a man who would probably eat

34:44.550 --> 34:47.150
the others if he went without
sugar for a few hours,

34:47.152 --> 34:49.485
walk into a hotel,

34:49.487 --> 34:51.388
sounds like the beginning
of a joke, doesn't it?

34:51.389 --> 34:52.956
And, in many ways, it was.

34:52.958 --> 34:56.426
One big funny ha-ha-ha
fuck-my-life joke.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.963
- You boys were out late.

34:59.965 --> 35:02.766
- Yeah, we ended up
on the wrong coach.

35:02.768 --> 35:05.402
- Hey, what are you like!

35:05.404 --> 35:07.471
I'm not one to talk,
though, I suppose.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.806
Me and my Hogarth,
God bless him,

35:09.808 --> 35:12.309
we were locked up in
a cell in Thailand

35:12.311 --> 35:15.345
for a whole month one summer.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.614
Such a cruel race.

35:17.616 --> 35:22.686
I mean, a little bit of Charlie
never hurt nobody, did it?

35:23.489 --> 35:25.021
So, how do you swing, then?

35:27.826 --> 35:30.627
You, I know a bottom
when I see one.

35:30.629 --> 35:31.495
- No.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.330
No, no, no, no.

35:33.332 --> 35:34.231
No, no.

35:35.334 --> 35:37.801
We are on the way
to see a friend.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.436
He's not very well.

35:39.438 --> 35:40.270
It's cancer.

35:40.272 --> 35:42.706
- Oh, nasty disease.

35:42.708 --> 35:43.607
Terrible.

35:46.411 --> 35:48.578
- Is that how Hogarth died?

35:48.580 --> 35:50.447
- Oh, no, love, no, no.

35:50.449 --> 35:52.782
It was the gimp mask
that killed him.

35:52.784 --> 35:54.384
Zip jammed on the mouth.

35:54.386 --> 35:56.520
(loudly gasping)

35:56.522 --> 35:57.954
But I sued the company.

35:57.956 --> 36:00.790
Used the money to
buy this place.

36:04.396 --> 36:07.197
(softly snoring)

36:18.577 --> 36:21.077
(door creaking)

36:21.079 --> 36:23.647
(tense music)

36:42.668 --> 36:43.633
(yelping)

36:43.635 --> 36:46.369
(screaming)

36:46.371 --> 36:50.507
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

36:51.376 --> 36:53.276
No, no, no, no, no, no!

36:53.278 --> 36:54.211
(yelps)

36:54.213 --> 36:55.912
Oh, God.
(loud moan)

36:55.914 --> 36:57.447
Oh, my God!
(loud thumping)

36:57.449 --> 37:00.517
(loud moaning)
(upbeat rock music)

37:00.519 --> 37:02.919
- [Man] Keep the
bloody noise down!

37:02.921 --> 37:04.287
- Adam! Gaz!

37:04.289 --> 37:05.388
They're all shagging!

37:05.390 --> 37:06.690
They're all shagging!

37:06.692 --> 37:07.524
- [Adam] Fuck's sake, mate!

37:07.526 --> 37:08.725
Put it away!

37:08.727 --> 37:10.827
- [Doris] Is something
the matter, love?

37:10.829 --> 37:12.562
- You're all freaks!

37:20.706 --> 37:21.838
- [Doris] Mm.

37:39.625 --> 37:40.924
- Good morning.

37:40.926 --> 37:43.593
We have a few questions
we like to ask you.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.028
- Oh, aye?

37:45.030 --> 37:49.032
What if I don't fancy
answering no questions, eh?

37:51.737 --> 37:53.403
- Then I cut off...

37:54.840 --> 37:56.373
The lips?

37:56.375 --> 37:58.275
- Da, the lips.
- Lips.

37:59.344 --> 38:02.012
- Hey, such a carry
on last night.

38:02.014 --> 38:04.648
I just assumed you
and your friends knew.

38:04.650 --> 38:07.350
We're highly reviewed
in Swinger's Digest.

38:07.352 --> 38:10.020
We even won a Blowie last year!

38:16.862 --> 38:19.562
- Where's Gaz and Smithy?

38:19.564 --> 38:22.065
- Why the fuck should I know?

38:22.067 --> 38:24.534
- Let's just get out of here.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.271
- Here's a little
gift bag from us.

38:28.273 --> 38:29.906
Your receipts are inside.

38:29.908 --> 38:32.909
- Thanks, Doris. See you again.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.611
- Ooh, it's lovely, that.

38:34.613 --> 38:37.847
Makes your bits taste
like strawberry.

38:45.023 --> 38:45.922
- Don't.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.325
Get off! Get off!

38:52.564 --> 38:53.663
- You're so frigid.

38:53.665 --> 38:54.531
- I am not frigid!

38:54.533 --> 38:56.099
I'm not!

38:56.101 --> 38:58.034
I just draw the line
at being passed around

38:58.036 --> 39:01.371
a group of grandparents
like nibbles at a party!

39:01.373 --> 39:03.673
- Oh, lighten up, will you?

39:04.910 --> 39:05.975
Ring Smithy.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.579
- You ring Smithy.

39:17.889 --> 39:20.056
(groans)

39:21.460 --> 39:23.126
- Oi, laddie.

39:23.128 --> 39:25.195
Are you with Gaz?

39:25.197 --> 39:27.664
I don't care, where are you?!

39:29.167 --> 39:29.999
Where?

39:30.001 --> 39:32.068
(car horn honking)

39:32.070 --> 39:32.902
Oh.

39:32.904 --> 39:36.139
(car engine rumbling)

39:45.317 --> 39:47.550
(tires screech)

39:47.552 --> 39:48.785
- [Gaz] All right?

39:48.787 --> 39:51.020
- I'm not getting in that.

39:52.224 --> 39:53.890
- Where did you get it?

39:53.892 --> 39:55.392
- Me and Smithy went
for a walk this morning.

39:55.394 --> 39:57.794
We met this guy trying
to get rid of his car.

39:57.796 --> 39:58.995
Dead nice.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.330
And he said we could
have it for free

40:00.332 --> 40:02.732
if I let him take
a few photos of me.

40:02.734 --> 40:03.633
- What?

40:04.403 --> 40:06.302
Gaz, did he touch you?

40:07.239 --> 40:08.772
- No, nothing funny.

40:08.774 --> 40:10.306
I just let him take a few
photos of me in my pants.

40:10.308 --> 40:12.075
It was dead innocent.

40:12.077 --> 40:12.976
- Was it?

40:13.745 --> 40:15.011
- I'm not getting in it.

40:15.013 --> 40:16.980
- It doesn't matter what
it looks like, does it?

40:16.982 --> 40:18.948
- No, as long as it
gets us to Frankie.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.483
- I don't give a shit,
I'm not getting in it.

40:20.485 --> 40:21.317
I'm not going in the car.

40:21.319 --> 40:22.552
It's not happening.

40:22.554 --> 40:24.921
It's not gonna happen,
not on my fucking life.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.656
- [Peter] A race against
time, across the country

40:26.658 --> 40:28.792
to see our dying friend
for one last time,

40:28.794 --> 40:30.894
it couldn't be more
heart-breaking,

40:30.896 --> 40:32.095
but it could've been in a car

40:32.097 --> 40:35.398
that didn't have RIM
JOB as the number plate.

40:35.400 --> 40:36.800
- And how was
Doris this morning?

40:36.802 --> 40:39.903
- I don't want her name
mentioned around me, thank you.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.604
- Don't see what the
fuss was about, really.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.273
- Well, you weren't
the one being molested,

40:43.275 --> 40:44.607
were you, Smithy?

40:44.609 --> 40:46.176
- Don't suppose you'd
mind, would you, Smithy?

40:46.178 --> 40:47.811
Need to pop your cherry one day.

40:47.813 --> 40:49.078
- Fuck off!

40:49.080 --> 40:50.146
I'm not a virgin.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.247
- Don't be silly.

40:51.249 --> 40:52.449
Of course you are.

40:52.451 --> 40:53.483
- [Smithy] I'm not.

40:53.485 --> 40:55.518
- Oh, leave him alone, Adam.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.620
I wish I'd waited
a bit longer, mate.

40:57.622 --> 40:59.055
- Losing your virginity
to a ham sandwich

40:59.057 --> 41:00.490
doesn't really
count, does it, Gaz?

41:00.492 --> 41:01.724
- Shut up, Adam.

41:01.726 --> 41:02.992
- And anyway, you
can't not be a virgin.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.327
You spent all of this
time wrapped around us.

41:04.329 --> 41:05.428
- I'm not a virgin.

41:05.430 --> 41:06.463
- You are!
- I'm not!

41:06.465 --> 41:07.397
- You are!
- I'm not!

41:07.399 --> 41:08.364
- But you are, though!

41:08.366 --> 41:09.732
- Are we really doing this?

41:09.734 --> 41:10.667
- First time you had sex.

41:10.669 --> 41:11.501
Go.

41:11.503 --> 41:12.702
- It was at...

41:14.206 --> 41:16.005
I can't.
- No, you can't

41:16.007 --> 41:16.973
'cause there isn't one.

41:16.975 --> 41:17.807
- [Smithy] There is.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.375
- Yeah, we believe you.

41:19.377 --> 41:21.311
Is she in the car with us now?

41:21.313 --> 41:22.679
- You know what, Adam,

41:22.681 --> 41:24.414
I bet I lost my
virginity before you did!

41:24.416 --> 41:25.882
- Oh, like fuck you did.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.417
Who'd have looked at that
pink acne'd face and thought,

41:27.419 --> 41:28.885
"I'll have a slice
of that pudding"?

41:28.887 --> 41:30.086
- [Smithy] Well, if it's
any of your business, Adam--

41:30.088 --> 41:31.321
- If you've spread your seed,

41:31.323 --> 41:33.256
I think it's the
world's business!

41:33.258 --> 41:34.958
It's quite sweet, really.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.292
Don't need to lie to us.

41:36.294 --> 41:38.394
- I'm not lying.
- No, of course you're not.

41:38.396 --> 41:39.596
He is.
- I'm not!

41:39.598 --> 41:40.964
- So, who was it, then, chubby?!

41:40.966 --> 41:42.432
Who was she?!

41:42.434 --> 41:43.833
- Just leave it, will you?
- Who would fuck you?!

41:43.835 --> 41:45.368
- Why do you need to know?!
- Who'd fuck that?!

41:45.370 --> 41:46.669
- Why are you pushing at it?!
- That useless piece of shit?!

41:46.671 --> 41:47.470
- It's none of your business!
- No one would--

41:47.472 --> 41:48.705
- Just leave it, Adam!

41:48.707 --> 41:50.673
- No one would--
- Mrs. Carmichael!

41:56.381 --> 41:58.715
- Mrs. Carmichael?

41:58.717 --> 42:00.416
- The music teacher?

42:04.222 --> 42:05.171
- Yeah.

42:05.172 --> 42:06.121
- Mrs. Carmichael
the music teacher?

42:06.124 --> 42:06.956
- Yes!

42:06.958 --> 42:07.790
(groans)

42:07.792 --> 42:08.825
- Fuck off.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.593
- Are you sure?

42:10.595 --> 42:13.263
- I'm pretty sure, Gaz.

42:13.265 --> 42:15.231
- Jesus Christ.

42:15.233 --> 42:17.033
- I'm gonna be sick.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.801
- Are you really sure?

42:18.803 --> 42:19.802
- Yes, Gaz!

42:23.575 --> 42:25.675
I stayed behind one
lesson and she sort of--

42:25.677 --> 42:27.477
- Tried out your flute?

42:27.479 --> 42:28.811
- No, we just--
- Hit some notes?

42:28.813 --> 42:29.646
- No, I--

42:29.648 --> 42:30.680
- Banged her drums?

42:30.682 --> 42:31.514
- Peter!

42:31.516 --> 42:33.349
- I am gonna be sick.

42:34.853 --> 42:36.586
- So, now, you know.

42:38.924 --> 42:40.390
I'm not a virgin.

42:47.532 --> 42:48.865
- Jesus Christ.

42:50.335 --> 42:53.736
- Well, think I need
a drink after that.

43:05.450 --> 43:07.483
(sighs)

43:11.122 --> 43:13.089
- Can you still smell it?

43:13.091 --> 43:16.259
- I think it's faded now, mate.

43:16.261 --> 43:17.894
- Do I want crisps?

43:18.763 --> 43:19.629
- Shitting fuck!

43:19.631 --> 43:20.663
Hide me! Everybody hide!

43:20.665 --> 43:21.998
- What? Hey?

43:22.000 --> 43:23.833
- [Adam] Oh, my God, it's--

43:23.835 --> 43:25.368
- Wow!

43:25.370 --> 43:26.536
No way!

43:26.538 --> 43:27.870
Oh, my God, wow.

43:27.872 --> 43:29.339
Hi guys!
- Neville?

43:29.341 --> 43:31.541
- Yeah, it's the old Nevillator.

43:31.543 --> 43:32.909
What are you doing here?

43:32.911 --> 43:34.377
How long's it been?

43:34.379 --> 43:36.746
What, 26 years, seven months,
three weeks, and two days?

43:36.748 --> 43:38.014
That's ages.

43:38.016 --> 43:40.316
- Another century
wouldn't go amiss!

43:40.318 --> 43:41.250
- We're on our way to--

43:41.252 --> 43:45.121
(loud thump)
Oh, to a thing.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.556
What you doing here?

43:46.558 --> 43:51.227
- Oh, stops off for a carvery
on the way to a funeral.

43:51.229 --> 43:52.161
Mad, isn't it?

43:52.163 --> 43:53.096
(chuckles)

43:53.098 --> 43:54.464
- Mental.

43:54.466 --> 43:56.699
- Sorry to hear about
your breakup, Peter.

43:56.701 --> 43:58.601
- How'd you know
about my breakup?

43:58.603 --> 44:00.169
- Oh, Facebook.

44:00.171 --> 44:01.404
Facebook's brilliant.

44:01.406 --> 44:03.006
I've been following
you lot for ages.

44:03.008 --> 44:03.940
Mad, isn't it?

44:03.942 --> 44:05.708
- But I'm not on Facebook.

44:05.710 --> 44:07.110
- I know, but Chelsea is.

44:07.112 --> 44:09.345
Yeah, she seems really happy.

44:09.347 --> 44:10.580
- Brilliant.

44:10.582 --> 44:12.281
- Is it true that
she cheated on you?

44:12.283 --> 44:13.883
Is it true she threw you out?

44:13.885 --> 44:15.151
Where are you staying now now?

44:15.153 --> 44:17.053
You can stay with me on
my bed seat if you like.

44:17.055 --> 44:19.088
- I think I can manage,
thanks, Neville.

44:19.090 --> 44:20.089
- Cool!

44:20.091 --> 44:21.357
Cute kid, Gaz!

44:21.359 --> 44:22.358
How old is she?

44:22.360 --> 44:24.360
- I'm going for a piss.

44:25.664 --> 44:26.829
- Oh, yeah, she's gonna be two

44:26.831 --> 44:28.064
in a couple of months,
actually, yeah.

44:28.066 --> 44:29.298
How did you know about Elle?

44:29.300 --> 44:31.300
- I'm friends with
Stacey on Facebook.

44:31.302 --> 44:32.602
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

44:32.604 --> 44:33.503
- Have you guys met?

44:33.505 --> 44:35.204
- Yeah. Once.

44:35.206 --> 44:36.839
Killer tattoo she's got.

44:36.841 --> 44:40.309
I didn't know you could
get a tattoo there.

44:40.311 --> 44:44.647
Anyway, just gonna go check
on the old pussy wagon.

44:50.155 --> 44:51.654
In a bit, homies!

44:58.363 --> 45:00.129
- Of all the people.

45:00.131 --> 45:00.963
- Facebook.

45:00.965 --> 45:02.932
What a load of rubbish.

45:05.570 --> 45:08.204
- What did he mean about Stace?

45:09.841 --> 45:12.742
(urine splashing)

45:16.915 --> 45:18.314
- Fuck's sake!

45:18.316 --> 45:21.050
You're supposed to
leave a fucking space!

45:21.052 --> 45:22.985
It's basic fucking manners!

45:22.987 --> 45:23.820
- Mad, isn't it?

45:23.822 --> 45:24.654
(Neville chuckles)

45:24.656 --> 45:25.922
- Isn't it?

45:25.924 --> 45:27.390
- So where are you off to?

45:27.392 --> 45:29.192
- Oh, fuck's sake!

45:29.194 --> 45:31.227
- Ah, fair dos.

45:31.229 --> 45:32.195
Can I come?

45:33.498 --> 45:36.833
(Adam groans)

45:36.835 --> 45:38.101
- Can we leave right now

45:38.103 --> 45:41.738
before that fuck weasel
comes out of the toilet?

45:42.874 --> 45:45.975
- Ah, thank God for,
oh, for fuck's sake.

45:45.977 --> 45:48.945
- Adam, you didn't
wash your hands.

45:51.182 --> 45:52.448
All right, Adam?

45:52.450 --> 45:53.649
Mad, this, isn't it?

45:53.651 --> 45:56.652
(Neville chuckles)

46:00.225 --> 46:03.559
- I have always
disliked you immensely.

46:06.264 --> 46:08.164
(yelps)

46:08.166 --> 46:09.298
Gaz, onwards.

46:13.138 --> 46:15.204
(sighs)

46:20.512 --> 46:21.844
- Does anyone want a Polo?

46:21.846 --> 46:22.678
- Oh, yeah.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.514
- [Adam] Yeah, go on.

46:28.920 --> 46:29.819
Oh.

46:31.022 --> 46:32.755
- [Peter] Thank you.

46:37.028 --> 46:41.264
- Gaz, who did you say you
got the car from again?

46:41.266 --> 46:42.832
- What's that?

46:42.834 --> 46:43.966
Oh.

46:43.968 --> 46:45.635
He was really nice.

46:46.704 --> 46:49.238
I think he might
have been a bit gay.

46:49.240 --> 46:50.773
- No, I'm sure the nice man

46:50.775 --> 46:53.142
just took pictures of you in
your pants to show his wife.

46:53.144 --> 46:54.043
- Really?

46:57.549 --> 47:00.082
- Why do I get the feeling
this is gonna be a long ride?

47:00.084 --> 47:01.751
- Oh, I don't know.

47:06.424 --> 47:10.159
(yells in foreign language)

47:16.568 --> 47:17.900
(door slams)

47:17.902 --> 47:19.969
- Bloody hell, Brian,
what you stop for?

47:19.971 --> 47:22.038
You near had my eye out!

47:24.042 --> 47:25.074
Morning, dears.

47:25.076 --> 47:26.209
Room for two?

47:29.480 --> 47:30.713
- [Gaz] What you doing, Pete?

47:30.715 --> 47:33.649
- I'm leaving a review
for that hell hole.

47:33.651 --> 47:35.685
How do you spell debauched?

47:35.687 --> 47:39.522
- D-E-B, uh, O-R-C-H?

47:41.926 --> 47:44.427
- No, that doesn't look right.

47:44.429 --> 47:46.796
Adam, how do you
spell, Jesus Christ!

47:46.798 --> 47:48.164
(sputtering)

47:48.166 --> 47:49.532
- Peter!

47:49.534 --> 47:51.767
- Shit, he looks terrible!

47:51.769 --> 47:54.036
- Where did you get
the second nose from?

47:54.038 --> 47:55.705
(laughs)

47:55.707 --> 47:56.873
Was it expensive?

47:56.875 --> 47:58.207
- [Gaz] What's he saying?

47:58.209 --> 47:59.742
- I think he's high!

47:59.744 --> 48:02.144
Adam, have you taken something?

48:02.146 --> 48:03.112
Adam?

48:03.114 --> 48:05.114
Adam, what have you taken?

48:05.116 --> 48:07.283
(Adam laughs)

48:07.285 --> 48:08.584
What are these?!

48:08.586 --> 48:10.086
Where did this come from?!
(screaming)

48:10.088 --> 48:12.722
Okay, so, the guy handing out
the cars for indecent images

48:12.724 --> 48:14.257
is also a drug
dealer too, is he?

48:14.259 --> 48:15.391
Well, well done, Gaz!

48:15.393 --> 48:16.626
Well fucking done!

48:16.628 --> 48:18.127
Adam, look at me!

48:18.129 --> 48:20.329
You've taken a vicious cocktail

48:20.331 --> 48:22.965
of various hallucinogenic drugs!

48:22.967 --> 48:24.033
(Adam laughs)

48:24.035 --> 48:26.102
- Peter, you're so oily.

48:27.238 --> 48:28.070
- Oily?!

48:28.072 --> 48:29.839
You prick, I'm not oily!

48:29.841 --> 48:33.042
- My dad, my dad, when
he finds out about this,

48:33.044 --> 48:35.778
he'll have you
turned into tampons.

48:35.780 --> 48:36.913
(laughs)

48:36.915 --> 48:40.716
And shoved into
Hillary's nice love vag.

48:40.718 --> 48:42.551
Beware the tangerine!

48:42.553 --> 48:45.755
(loud thud)
(Adam sputtering)

48:45.757 --> 48:47.657
- Thank fuck for that.

48:49.327 --> 48:51.727
- Well, he's not dead.

48:51.729 --> 48:52.995
Just unconscious.

48:52.997 --> 48:54.230
- [Gaz] Don't we need to
get him to a hospital?!

48:54.232 --> 48:55.598
I mean, he might need
his stomach pumped!

48:55.600 --> 48:56.632
- We haven't got time!

48:56.634 --> 48:58.134
We need to get to Frankie!

48:58.136 --> 49:01.537
(Adam heaves)
Oh, don't!

49:05.343 --> 49:06.742
- He'll be fine.

49:08.446 --> 49:09.879
Who wants another Polo?

49:09.881 --> 49:10.813
- [Gaz] No!

49:10.815 --> 49:12.815
- Oh, I do love role-playing.

49:12.817 --> 49:14.317
It reminds me of the time

49:14.319 --> 49:16.986
my Hogarth locked me in
the basement for a month.

49:16.988 --> 49:19.055
Oh, he did a brilliant
Josef Fritzl.

49:19.057 --> 49:23.359
The accent was spot on.
- Four men came here, yes?

49:23.361 --> 49:24.927
- You'll have to be a
bit more specific, love.

49:24.929 --> 49:26.462
- Yesterday, four men.

49:26.464 --> 49:27.797
Where are they?

49:27.799 --> 49:29.865
- Oh, you mean Peter
and his friends.

49:29.867 --> 49:32.201
Oh, they're not
gay, you know, boys?

49:32.203 --> 49:33.569
You're out of luck.

49:33.571 --> 49:35.237
Oh, not 'cause I'm
judging, of course.

49:35.239 --> 49:38.240
My friend Mickey, Uncut Mick
we call him, just our little--

49:38.242 --> 49:39.442
- Where are they?!

49:39.444 --> 49:41.043
- Mickey and his Paul?

49:41.045 --> 49:42.511
The Canary's, I think.

49:42.513 --> 49:44.380
Lovely cruise by all accounts.

49:44.382 --> 49:46.983
(knife clanks)
(screaming)

49:46.985 --> 49:48.050
Bloody hell!

49:49.053 --> 49:50.920
- What are you doing?!

49:50.922 --> 49:52.388
- Now, you listen
here, young man,

49:52.390 --> 49:54.223
I'm all for a bit of
kinky every now and then,

49:54.225 --> 49:56.559
but I draw the line at violence!

49:56.561 --> 49:58.294
(vibrator buzzes)
- Think I'm going to faint.

49:58.296 --> 49:59.128
- Where are they?!

49:59.130 --> 50:00.429
You tell me now!

50:00.431 --> 50:01.697
- Well, they left
about an hour ago,

50:01.699 --> 50:03.199
but I don't see what's
that got to do--

50:03.201 --> 50:04.100
- Fuck it!

50:07.271 --> 50:09.605
- Don't forget to tell
your friends about us!

50:09.607 --> 50:12.308
The Nip Slip, Blowie Award
winning establishment

50:12.310 --> 50:15.211
of pleasure and
rela, oh, fuck it.

50:16.781 --> 50:18.014
(mellow music)

50:18.016 --> 50:20.383
- No.
(radio clicks)

50:20.385 --> 50:22.018
(upbeat rock music)

50:22.020 --> 50:23.419
(radio clicks)
Oh, no.

50:23.421 --> 50:25.354
(upbeat music)

50:25.356 --> 50:26.589
(radio clicks)
No.

50:26.591 --> 50:28.224
(upbeat music)
Ah, that's--

50:28.226 --> 50:29.792
(loud clunk)
- What's that?

50:29.794 --> 50:30.960
- Aerosmith.

50:30.962 --> 50:32.028
- No, no, that noise!
(loud clunking)

50:32.030 --> 50:33.429
- What?

50:33.431 --> 50:35.498
- There's a light
flashing on the dashboard.

50:35.500 --> 50:37.867
- Oh, that, that's
probably nothing.

50:37.869 --> 50:38.768
(loud crash)

50:38.770 --> 50:40.102
Oh.

50:40.104 --> 50:41.537
Well, actually, that
could be something.

50:41.539 --> 50:43.372
- Well, quick, pull over!

50:43.374 --> 50:45.574
Get on the hard shoulder,
you fucking fuck stick!

50:45.576 --> 50:47.076
- All right.

50:47.078 --> 50:48.544
Oh, Jesus Christ.

50:56.187 --> 50:58.821
(engine whirs)

50:59.824 --> 51:02.058
(engine whirs)

51:02.060 --> 51:04.493
(laughs)

51:04.495 --> 51:06.162
The battery's dead.

51:06.164 --> 51:08.130
(Peter laughs)

51:08.132 --> 51:10.132
- Oh, how strange.

51:10.134 --> 51:12.234
It's almost like
someone wasted it

51:12.236 --> 51:15.538
trying to choose a
fucking radio station!

51:15.540 --> 51:16.939
You!

51:16.941 --> 51:19.675
- [Gaz] I think I've got a bite!

51:23.314 --> 51:24.980
You going anywhere
near Dewsbury?

51:24.982 --> 51:25.848
- What?

51:25.850 --> 51:26.849
- Dewsbury.

51:35.760 --> 51:38.327
(punch thuds)

51:40.465 --> 51:42.698
(screams)

51:42.700 --> 51:45.601
(punch thuds)

51:45.603 --> 51:48.170
(punch thuds)

51:59.383 --> 52:01.951
- Can I not leave you lot
for more than a fucking hour

52:01.953 --> 52:04.186
and not expect you to fuck
things up while I'm gone?!

52:04.188 --> 52:05.688
- Oh, God!

52:05.690 --> 52:08.324
- What the fuck have you done?!

52:09.627 --> 52:10.459
- Where are they?

52:10.461 --> 52:11.994
- Where are who?!

52:11.996 --> 52:13.596
- Oh, my head's throbbing.

52:13.598 --> 52:15.764
- Oh, fuck's sake.

52:15.766 --> 52:16.999
Peter!

52:17.001 --> 52:18.300
Peter, wake up!

52:21.205 --> 52:22.505
- Oh, shit. Where are we?

52:22.507 --> 52:25.741
- Oh, brilliant
fucking question!

52:25.743 --> 52:26.642
- Are they here?

52:26.644 --> 52:28.043
- Are who here?!

52:29.180 --> 52:31.013
- There was two men.

52:31.015 --> 52:32.214
We were hitchhiking.

52:32.216 --> 52:33.182
- Hitchhiking?!

52:33.184 --> 52:34.683
Fucking hitchhiking?!

52:34.685 --> 52:37.753
Are you trying to get us put
on the fucking register?!

52:37.755 --> 52:38.954
- My ropes aren't very tight.

52:38.956 --> 52:39.922
- Oh.

52:39.924 --> 52:42.224
Oh, oh, you should complain.

52:42.226 --> 52:44.393
- I think I can
get my hands free!

52:44.395 --> 52:45.928
- How many did you
say there were?

52:45.930 --> 52:47.129
- Two.
- Two?!

52:47.131 --> 52:48.197
Fucking two?!

52:48.199 --> 52:49.832
And there's three of you?!

52:49.834 --> 52:52.768
Four if fucking Shrek here
used me as a blunt instrument!

52:52.770 --> 52:54.003
Oh, fucking brilliant!

52:54.005 --> 52:56.038
Are you telling me that
two fucking randoms

52:56.040 --> 52:57.273
got the better of you three?!

52:57.275 --> 52:58.874
- They were dangerous, Adam!

52:58.876 --> 53:01.043
- Oh, well, they would
have to be, wouldn't they,

53:01.045 --> 53:04.480
to get the better of you
three fucking musket twats!

53:04.482 --> 53:05.347
Oi!
- Adam.

53:05.349 --> 53:06.515
- Hey!

53:06.517 --> 53:07.783
You two!

53:07.785 --> 53:09.351
- Adam.
- Where the fuck are you?!

53:09.353 --> 53:10.786
- Adam.
- I wanna find out

53:10.788 --> 53:14.123
what pair of
fucking fuck Muppets

53:14.125 --> 53:17.193
have got the fucking
balloons to tie me up

53:17.195 --> 53:18.561
in the middle of
fucking no where

53:18.563 --> 53:21.297
with these three augmented tits!

53:22.099 --> 53:23.365
- [Smithy] Adam, shh!

53:23.367 --> 53:24.266
- Look.

53:27.772 --> 53:28.604
- Hi gents.

53:28.606 --> 53:30.706
(chuckles)

53:30.708 --> 53:31.707
I was meant to call you.

53:31.709 --> 53:33.242
(Adam chuckles)
- Hello!

53:33.244 --> 53:36.412
(kick thuds)
(Adam groans)

53:36.414 --> 53:37.980
- Oh, fair enough.

53:38.849 --> 53:41.050
Oh, well, never mind.

53:41.052 --> 53:42.985
You guys must be really angry.

53:42.987 --> 53:44.853
(kick thuds)
Oh, fuck.

53:44.855 --> 53:47.423
(Adam groans)

53:50.027 --> 53:54.029
Oh, (chuckles) look,
there's my crown.

53:54.031 --> 53:55.030
Never mind.

53:57.835 --> 54:00.336
- We have been looking
for you, Mr. Woods.

54:00.338 --> 54:03.405
- You know what it's like, last
minute holiday and all that.

54:03.407 --> 54:05.040
- What?

54:05.042 --> 54:06.508
- You owe me a lot of money.

54:06.510 --> 54:07.977
- Oh, well, come on!

54:07.979 --> 54:10.045
You say a lot of money, it's
not a lot of money, not really.

54:10.047 --> 54:11.814
- 50,000 pounds!

54:11.816 --> 54:12.848
- 50 grand?!

54:14.018 --> 54:15.951
- [Smithy] What did you
need 50,000 pounds for?!

54:15.953 --> 54:17.453
- Things!
- What?!

54:18.689 --> 54:19.521
- And anyway, it
doesn't really matter

54:19.523 --> 54:20.723
'cause I've their money.

54:20.725 --> 54:22.758
- You do not have
the money, Mr. Woods.

54:22.760 --> 54:25.527
If you had the money, I think
you would have given it to me.

54:25.529 --> 54:26.962
- What are you gonna do to him?

54:26.964 --> 54:28.197
- Him?!

54:28.199 --> 54:29.331
Him?!

54:29.333 --> 54:30.899
Oh, thanks a fucking bunch!

54:30.901 --> 54:32.868
That's solidarity,
that is, right there!

54:32.870 --> 54:34.203
- He's right, Mr. Woods.

54:34.205 --> 54:36.472
- Yeah, fucking
right I'm, what?!

54:36.474 --> 54:38.474
- We will deal with
you, Mr. Woods.

54:38.476 --> 54:41.243
And your friends will
be dealt with also.

54:41.245 --> 54:42.378
- [Smithy] Huh?!

54:42.380 --> 54:43.612
What for?!

54:43.614 --> 54:47.149
- Witnesses, they're
not good for business.

54:49.120 --> 54:50.853
(grunts)

54:50.855 --> 54:53.222
(punches thudding)

54:53.224 --> 54:55.524
- Fucking untie
me, you spatulas!

54:55.526 --> 54:58.093
(punch thuds)

54:58.863 --> 55:00.596
Oh, for fuck's sake!

55:05.569 --> 55:07.936
(loud clang)
(loud crash)

55:07.938 --> 55:09.638
(loud slap)

55:09.640 --> 55:10.706
Oh, get off!

55:12.743 --> 55:13.742
- You fucking--

55:13.744 --> 55:15.344
- I'm so sorry.

55:15.346 --> 55:18.213
(thrilling music)

55:29.527 --> 55:31.994
(rod clangs)

55:36.200 --> 55:37.933
Jesus Christ.

55:37.935 --> 55:39.335
I've killed him.

55:39.337 --> 55:41.570
Oh, my God, I've killed
him, I've killed him.

55:41.572 --> 55:42.805
I've killed him.

55:42.807 --> 55:44.006
Oh, Jesus Christ,
I've killed him.

55:44.008 --> 55:45.574
- No, you've just
knocked him out a bit.

55:45.576 --> 55:48.277
- Fucking untie me,
you fucking helmets!

55:48.279 --> 55:51.146
- Those men, they
were following us?!

55:51.148 --> 55:52.147
- I don't know.

55:52.149 --> 55:53.082
Maybe.

55:53.084 --> 55:54.616
- They could've killed us, mate!

55:54.618 --> 55:57.052
- They are dangerous gangsters!

55:57.054 --> 55:58.520
And Russian!

55:58.522 --> 56:01.090
- You should've told us, Adam!

56:02.526 --> 56:04.793
- Look, all right, I'm sorry.

56:04.795 --> 56:06.628
- [Peter] What?

56:06.630 --> 56:08.364
- I'm fucking sorry!

56:09.467 --> 56:10.800
- [Peter] Are you
sure he isn't dead?

56:10.801 --> 56:12.134
Because I don't want to
sound big-headed or anything,

56:12.136 --> 56:13.302
but I did actually
hit him quite hard.

56:13.304 --> 56:14.470
- [Gaz] It really
wasn't that hard, mate.

56:14.472 --> 56:15.871
- [Peter] Well, look, Gaz,
you would be surprised.

56:15.873 --> 56:17.139
I can be quite strong sometimes.

56:17.141 --> 56:18.941
I might have hit him
really hard, actually, so--

56:18.943 --> 56:20.242
- [Adam] Fuck's sake,
it was barely a flick.

56:20.244 --> 56:22.077
He probably fainted
from boredom.

56:22.079 --> 56:23.512
- [Peter] No, actually,
you don't get to talk!

56:23.514 --> 56:25.914
You don't get to talk
because it's your fault

56:25.916 --> 56:28.817
someone may or may not
be lying dead in there

56:28.819 --> 56:33.288
because you're a bad friend
and a fucking shit face!

56:33.290 --> 56:34.123
- [Gaz] Jackpot!

56:34.125 --> 56:35.023
- Yes.

56:39.497 --> 56:42.131
(gentle music)

57:19.603 --> 57:20.736
It's so nice.

57:24.642 --> 57:25.974
- No, it's not.

57:28.279 --> 57:30.012
- I'm nervous, Adam.

57:32.249 --> 57:33.582
- Yeah, me too.

57:35.553 --> 57:36.618
Hey, what if
Frankie's turned into

57:36.620 --> 57:37.920
a complete prick or something?

57:37.922 --> 57:39.154
- Gaz.

57:39.156 --> 57:41.990
You can't say that
about dying people.

57:43.127 --> 57:45.360
- Frankie's not like that.

57:47.264 --> 57:48.831
He'll be the same.

57:54.805 --> 57:55.871
Oh, fuck it.

58:16.026 --> 58:17.960
- Where is everyone?

58:17.962 --> 58:20.028
- Maybe they're being burgled.

58:20.030 --> 58:21.263
- Or maybe the door's open

58:21.265 --> 58:24.833
because of something
more reasonable?

58:24.835 --> 58:27.970
Look, we need to be
a bit respectful.

58:28.906 --> 58:30.439
He's not well.

58:30.441 --> 58:31.406
He's probably tired.

58:31.408 --> 58:32.374
- Bollocks!

58:33.244 --> 58:34.776
He might be bald and skinny,

58:34.778 --> 58:37.746
but I've been through hell
and back to see that gimp.

58:37.748 --> 58:38.981
(sighs)

58:38.983 --> 58:42.584
Frankie Joseph Budden,
you terminal legend.

58:49.593 --> 58:52.728
(somber piano music)

58:54.899 --> 58:55.797
- No.

58:59.570 --> 59:00.469
No.

59:03.507 --> 59:06.141
- Have they been burgled, Pete?

59:12.016 --> 59:12.915
Pete?

59:20.591 --> 59:22.291
- You just missed him.

59:22.293 --> 59:24.526
He died yesterday morning.

59:29.800 --> 59:30.699
I'm sorry.

59:34.572 --> 59:36.805
- I thought we had longer.

59:36.807 --> 59:41.510
- We had longer with him
than we thought we would.

59:41.512 --> 59:42.744
We were lucky.

59:45.149 --> 59:46.515
- Did he...

59:46.517 --> 59:47.349
I mean, was it--

59:47.351 --> 59:49.351
- Gaz, it was peaceful.

59:55.292 --> 59:57.526
The funeral's at
the end of the week.

59:57.528 --> 59:58.927
You should stay.

01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:03.031
- End of the week?

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:04.366
So soon?

01:00:04.368 --> 01:00:07.936
- He had everything
planned out, paid for.

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:12.874
No point hanging about, eh?
(Adam whimpers)

01:00:12.876 --> 01:00:15.377
Adam, son, are you all right?

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:21.683
He tried holding on.

01:00:21.685 --> 01:00:22.584
He did.

01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:25.887
He really wanted to see you.

01:00:28.759 --> 01:00:30.993
Melanie's coming back tomorrow.

01:00:30.995 --> 01:00:33.829
I'm sure she'd like
to meet you all.

01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:35.831
- Who's Melanie?

01:00:35.833 --> 01:00:36.832
- His wife.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.703
- They loved each other so much.

01:00:45.576 --> 01:00:48.310
God, I hope Tammy remembers him.

01:00:49.413 --> 01:00:50.646
- Who's Tammy?

01:00:52.216 --> 01:00:53.882
- Their girl.

01:00:53.884 --> 01:00:56.485
Little tyke, just like her dad.

01:01:08.298 --> 01:01:09.931
Adam.

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:12.467
(tense music)

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:41.430
- [Yslav] Hey!

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.899
Hey!

01:02:13.097 --> 01:02:15.263
- I don't want to do this.

01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:16.064
- Why not?

01:02:16.967 --> 01:02:17.899
She's his wife.

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:19.101
It'll be nice to meet her.

01:02:19.103 --> 01:02:20.836
- I don't want to do it.

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:23.238
- What's wrong with you?

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.476
There's upset, and there's
just plain dickheadery.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:35.117
- It's nice to meet you.

01:02:38.555 --> 01:02:41.523
Frankie spoke about
you all the time.

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:43.091
He loved you boys.

01:02:44.561 --> 01:02:47.195
He always meant to, to reunite.

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:50.732
Then he was diagnosed.

01:02:50.734 --> 01:02:51.633
Sorry.

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:56.605
- We tried to get here on time.

01:02:56.607 --> 01:02:57.739
- It's fine.

01:02:57.741 --> 01:02:59.608
He knew you were trying.

01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:03.044
It's just, it escalated
quite quickly.

01:03:03.046 --> 01:03:03.945
Sorry.

01:03:06.517 --> 01:03:11.086
He was watching this,
the night before he died.

01:03:11.088 --> 01:03:13.455
He said you should watch it.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.191
- Our end of year assembly?

01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:17.759
- From our second year?

01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:19.461
- I think so.

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:20.762
Do you want to watch it?

01:03:20.764 --> 01:03:23.498
- [Adam] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:28.071 --> 01:03:32.440
♪ All things bright
and beautiful ♪

01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:36.545
♪ All creatures
great and small ♪

01:03:36.547 --> 01:03:37.679
(Peter chuckles)

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:39.181
- Fucking leaves.

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:42.617
Why does this even exist?

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:45.821
- I remember that.

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:48.223
I had bruises for weeks.

01:03:48.225 --> 01:03:50.058
- Friendship bruises.

01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:56.331
- [Peter] Why was
Frankie laughing?

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:58.400
- He looks really happy.

01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:01.803
- It sounds a bit silly,

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:04.206
but I was always got a bit
jealous when he talked about you,

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:06.508
about all the
things that you did.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:08.710
- Oh, we did so much shit.

01:04:08.712 --> 01:04:10.712
Surprised we never got caught.

01:04:10.714 --> 01:04:12.247
- Nah.

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:14.115
Frankie was too clever for that.

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:16.818
(Peter chuckles)

01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:21.690
(static crackles)

01:04:21.692 --> 01:04:24.759
- Is this fucking thing
recording now, or what?

01:04:24.761 --> 01:04:25.827
Hello, lads.

01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:31.433
First things first: you're
really fucking late.

01:04:35.439 --> 01:04:37.005
Not winning, boys.

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:39.474
You are shit.

01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:45.413
I'm not sure if you
will see this video.

01:04:45.415 --> 01:04:46.715
I mean, if you
hurry your asses up

01:04:46.717 --> 01:04:49.618
and get here in time,
you won't have to.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:52.354
But if you are
watching this video,

01:04:52.356 --> 01:04:57.092
well, then it means you
probably didn't make it in time.

01:04:57.995 --> 01:04:58.894
I know.

01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:02.597
I look like shit, don't I?

01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:06.534
A big bald fucking baby.

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:11.640
That's all right, I have cancer.

01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:18.079
Okay, so, really wanted
to see you all again.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:21.082
I really did.

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:23.418
I don't know why I
didn't phone more,

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.553
or why we didn't meet up.

01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:28.523
Guess life just kind of carries

01:05:28.525 --> 01:05:30.425
you away sometimes, don't it?

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:32.494
(somber piano music)

01:05:32.496 --> 01:05:36.498
So, there is a few things
that I wanted to say.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:37.399
Okay, Gaz.

01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:44.339
There's no real easy way
for me to say this, but...

01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:56.184
Well, basically, your wife
has been cheating on you.

01:05:56.186 --> 01:05:57.252
Sorry, mate.

01:06:00.524 --> 01:06:04.359
And, of course, you
know, that explains Elle.

01:06:08.899 --> 01:06:10.131
Right, anyway.

01:06:14.271 --> 01:06:15.170
Smithy.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.206
Smithy, mate.

01:06:19.876 --> 01:06:21.609
You are fucking top.

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.446
Mean that, bud.

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:25.680
You're fucking top.

01:06:25.682 --> 01:06:27.248
Don't let anybody
tell you otherwise.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:28.483
You're fucking brilliant.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.552
Ignore Adam 'cause
he's a bellend.

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:31.453
You know?

01:06:33.724 --> 01:06:36.224
And also talk to Melanie.

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:38.827
She'll give you some numbers
of a few of her mates.

01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:40.128
Just don't leer.

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:41.463
Yeah, you're a leerer, mate.

01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:42.397
Stop it.

01:06:42.399 --> 01:06:44.666
Girls don't like that shit.

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:48.269
Peter.

01:06:48.271 --> 01:06:50.005
Peter, Peter, Peter.

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:55.210
Just wear less
knitted vests, yeah?

01:06:55.212 --> 01:06:56.511
Just wear less knitted vests.

01:06:56.513 --> 01:06:57.979
They don't do anything
for you, mate.

01:06:57.981 --> 01:07:00.348
They just make you look
like a hungry librarian.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:01.416
And a prick.

01:07:02.419 --> 01:07:03.752
I'm only joking, mate.

01:07:03.754 --> 01:07:04.686
Love you.

01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:08.623
And last but by no
means least, Adam.

01:07:22.973 --> 01:07:23.805
I'll always remember--

01:07:23.807 --> 01:07:26.374
(recording clicks)

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.275
- No, no.

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:31.012
What's wrong?

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:32.279
- Oh, he never had a
clue what he was doing

01:07:32.282 --> 01:07:33.748
with this sort of thing.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.150
I'm sorry, Adam.

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:43.258
- It's fine.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.893
It's fine.

01:07:44.895 --> 01:07:47.028
Maybe we should just...

01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:49.898
Maybe we should
probably just go.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.001
- Can you tell Richard
we won't be long?

01:07:53.003 --> 01:07:55.236
Just need to get some air.

01:07:57.641 --> 01:07:59.541
Look, I'm sorry about him.

01:07:59.543 --> 01:08:01.810
He's really not
taking it very well.

01:08:01.812 --> 01:08:03.545
- It's fine, really.

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:07.949
- Adam, we all loved him.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:26.234
- Were Frankie and
Adam boyfriends?

01:08:28.872 --> 01:08:30.371
- I hate camping.

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:33.841
- We're not camping.

01:08:34.644 --> 01:08:36.243
- No?

01:08:36.246 --> 01:08:38.912
Sitting around a fire,
sleeping outdoors?

01:08:38.915 --> 01:08:41.149
No, you're right.

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:44.252
- Well, it's better than
being in there with...

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:45.653
With them.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.856
They didn't know
Frankie like we did.

01:08:47.858 --> 01:08:50.291
- His wife and his parents?

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.091
- [Adam] We knew him.

01:08:51.094 --> 01:08:52.327
We did.

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:53.228
Properly.

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:56.798
- I met him in detention.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.232
Frankie, that is.

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:05.807
When Mr. Gulliver went out
of the room, to the toilet,

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:07.542
he dipped his bullocks
in his coffee cup.

01:09:07.544 --> 01:09:09.711
(laughs)

01:09:11.014 --> 01:09:12.779
He had scalded bullocks
for weeks after that.

01:09:12.782 --> 01:09:14.948
(laughs)

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:20.455
You know, I thought
we might be able

01:09:20.457 --> 01:09:23.691
to do something
when we got here.

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:25.926
A few jokes, or something.

01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:29.596
Like we used to.

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:44.479
(students gasp)
(students laugh)

01:09:44.481 --> 01:09:46.046
- Is it a flower?

01:09:46.049 --> 01:09:47.549
- Is it too much?

01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:49.216
I thought we wanted
to be remembered.

01:09:49.219 --> 01:09:50.118
- "Is it too much"?

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.086
- Oh, fucking hell!

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:53.988
- Yeah, just a smidge.

01:09:55.158 --> 01:09:57.125
- [Mr. Frazer] Fuckers.

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:03.531
- You remember Jamie Risco?

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:04.599
- Mm.
- Yeah.

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.570
- He used to shove my
head down the toilet

01:10:08.572 --> 01:10:11.206
every Wednesday before Science.

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:14.909
Frankie walked in on
him doing it once,

01:10:14.911 --> 01:10:16.711
told Risco to do one.

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:20.882
Never ever did it again.

01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:27.755
He always stood up
for me like that.

01:10:30.961 --> 01:10:31.859
Top bloke.

01:10:35.665 --> 01:10:37.465
What about you, Adam?

01:10:38.635 --> 01:10:42.203
You knew him before
we did, before school.

01:10:43.873 --> 01:10:45.707
How did you two meet?

01:10:48.345 --> 01:10:50.211
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.818
Well, he moved in a
few doors down from us,

01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:00.188
and one night I nicked
one of Dad's fags

01:11:01.091 --> 01:11:02.523
and took it round the bins,

01:11:02.525 --> 01:11:03.992
and he was already there,

01:11:03.994 --> 01:11:06.294
smoking a 10-pack he'd stolen
from his mum's handbag.

01:11:06.296 --> 01:11:08.396
(laughs)

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:15.103
We couldn't
separated after that.

01:11:21.478 --> 01:11:24.545
Do I look like I'm
fucking crying?!

01:11:24.547 --> 01:11:26.347
- Yes, a bit.

01:11:26.349 --> 01:11:27.248
You do.

01:11:33.923 --> 01:11:36.257
- We made it here together.

01:11:37.427 --> 01:11:41.763
And at least we get to
say goodbye to Frankie.

01:11:41.765 --> 01:11:43.665
- Wasn't exactly
straight forward, was it?

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:45.099
(chuckles)

01:11:45.101 --> 01:11:47.502
- You literally went
through shit, Peter.

01:11:47.504 --> 01:11:50.171
(group laughs)

01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:57.512
- Well, at least I didn't
fuck Mrs. Carmichael.

01:11:57.514 --> 01:11:59.347
- Yeah, all right.

01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:00.782
What, and that's
worse than posing

01:12:00.784 --> 01:12:02.216
in your Y-fronts to get a car?

01:12:02.218 --> 01:12:04.852
(group laughs)

01:12:10.226 --> 01:12:11.592
- Cars are here.

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:22.770
- We are gathered here
on this very sad day

01:12:22.772 --> 01:12:26.908
to celebrate the life
of our brother Francis.

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:29.811
(somber piano music)

01:12:29.813 --> 01:12:32.613
I believe Francis's
father, Richard,

01:12:32.615 --> 01:12:35.350
has prepared a few words to say.

01:12:54.671 --> 01:12:56.070
- Frankie was...

01:13:08.752 --> 01:13:12.787
He was a total pain
in the arse mostly.

01:13:12.789 --> 01:13:14.789
There wasn't a day went
by when he was young

01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:19.494
when he wasn't wanting to
borrow money or asking a favor.

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:23.731
I loved those years.

01:13:24.968 --> 01:13:27.335
Me and his mum,
Francine, were his chefs,

01:13:27.337 --> 01:13:30.171
chauffeurs, bankers,
you name it.

01:13:32.609 --> 01:13:36.177
And he always asked
with that cheeky grin.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:42.617
The little fucker.

01:13:42.619 --> 01:13:44.519
We could never say no.

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:52.894
I was with him the
night he let go.

01:13:56.399 --> 01:13:58.166
I could tell.

01:13:58.168 --> 01:13:59.400
He could tell.

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:04.605
It was like there was a
big shadow over the house.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:07.642
Melanie was telling him about
the first time they met,

01:14:07.644 --> 01:14:09.277
and he was smiling.

01:14:13.883 --> 01:14:17.852
It was the first time
he'd smiled in ages.

01:14:17.854 --> 01:14:19.353
Frankie would never be overtaken

01:14:19.355 --> 01:14:23.157
by the horrible disease
that took him in the end.

01:14:26.996 --> 01:14:29.597
The cancer didn't meet
Frankie's wife, Melanie.

01:14:29.599 --> 01:14:32.834
The cancer didn't propose,
it didn't marry her.

01:14:32.836 --> 01:14:35.503
The cancer wasn't the father
to Frankie's daughter, Tammy.

01:14:35.505 --> 01:14:37.738
The cancer wasn't our son!

01:14:42.545 --> 01:14:43.611
Frankie was.

01:14:47.884 --> 01:14:49.717
That was all Frankie.

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:54.522
Son,

01:14:54.524 --> 01:14:55.423
husband,

01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:57.892
father,

01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:02.196
and mate.

01:15:08.438 --> 01:15:10.104
I'll miss you, son.

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:28.289
(upbeat rock music)

01:15:29.659 --> 01:15:31.993
(sniffing)

01:15:35.665 --> 01:15:36.898
- Smell that.

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:39.000
Egg mayonnaise or
prawn cocktail?

01:15:39.002 --> 01:15:42.637
Frankly, it's worrying
you can't tell them apart.

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:43.504
- Mad, isn't it?

01:15:43.506 --> 01:15:44.372
- Neville?!

01:15:46.776 --> 01:15:47.775
What? Why?

01:15:47.776 --> 01:15:48.775
This is the funeral
you were going to?

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:49.844
- Yeah.

01:15:49.846 --> 01:15:51.846
- You knew Frankie had died?

01:15:51.848 --> 01:15:53.014
- Yeah, saw it on--

01:15:53.016 --> 01:15:54.215
- Facebook.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:55.616
- [Neville] Mad, isn't it?

01:15:55.618 --> 01:15:58.152
- You knew Frankie had died,

01:15:58.154 --> 01:16:00.988
but you didn't think to
tell his best friends

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:01.989
when you saw them?

01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:04.625
- No, yeah, must've forgot.

01:16:04.627 --> 01:16:06.327
Sorry, Peter.

01:16:06.329 --> 01:16:07.562
What you doing after this?

01:16:07.564 --> 01:16:09.797
Can I come?
- Oh, fuck off!

01:16:10.833 --> 01:16:11.732
Twat rag!

01:16:22.445 --> 01:16:24.946
- [Peter] Everything sort of
unclenches after a funeral.

01:16:24.948 --> 01:16:26.447
The sad stuff's over with,

01:16:26.449 --> 01:16:27.815
and now the one thing
everyone wants to do

01:16:27.817 --> 01:16:29.717
is drink and forget.

01:16:29.719 --> 01:16:31.252
One thing to be said for wakes,

01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:33.654
there's always alcohol,
and lots of it.

01:16:33.656 --> 01:16:35.256
And one thing to be
said for alcohol,

01:16:35.258 --> 01:16:39.493
it's a bloody brilliant cure
for big fat wusses like Smithy.

01:16:39.495 --> 01:16:42.029
- I'm gonna go over to her.

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:43.631
- Right.

01:16:43.633 --> 01:16:46.934
Maybe try to look less
murderous before you do.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:47.835
- Ah.

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:04.051
All right?

01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:09.023
Do you come here often?

01:17:09.025 --> 01:17:10.257
- To funerals?

01:17:12.562 --> 01:17:14.829
You must be Smithy.

01:17:14.831 --> 01:17:17.031
Melanie's told me about you.

01:17:17.033 --> 01:17:18.432
- [Smithy] Did she?

01:17:18.434 --> 01:17:19.834
- [Sally] Mm.

01:17:19.836 --> 01:17:21.802
- Oh, she did, did she?

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:24.872
- Yeah.

01:17:25.842 --> 01:17:26.741
- She did?

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:28.876
Okay.

01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:31.445
What exactly did she--

01:17:31.447 --> 01:17:32.346
- Stop.

01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:35.950
You're doing it all wrong.

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:38.386
- Yeah.

01:17:38.388 --> 01:17:41.222
Look, I didn't
even ask your name.

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:43.991
Sorry.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:44.892
- Sally.

01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:49.664
How about a drink, hey?

01:17:50.733 --> 01:17:51.632
- Yeah.

01:18:00.076 --> 01:18:02.810
(softly crying)

01:18:09.652 --> 01:18:11.986
(kick thuds)
(Adam groans)

01:18:11.988 --> 01:18:15.222
- You fucking English bastard!
(kicks thudding)

01:18:15.224 --> 01:18:17.324
(groans)

01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:20.728
(kick thuds)

01:18:22.165 --> 01:18:23.597
(punch thuds)

01:18:23.599 --> 01:18:25.933
(punch thuds)

01:18:25.935 --> 01:18:27.201
(punch thuds)

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:32.273
(punch thuds)
(Adam groans)

01:18:32.809 --> 01:18:34.408
(punch thuds)

01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:35.543
(punch thuds)

01:18:35.545 --> 01:18:36.711
(head thuds)
(Adam groans)

01:18:36.713 --> 01:18:37.945
- Fuck.

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:40.514
(punch thuds)

01:18:42.251 --> 01:18:44.852
(knee thuds)

01:18:44.854 --> 01:18:49.423
(grunts)
(loud crack)

01:18:51.527 --> 01:18:52.426
Yslav?

01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:56.430
Are you all right, mate?

01:18:56.432 --> 01:18:57.331
Oh, shit!

01:19:00.937 --> 01:19:02.503
- I can't hear you properly!

01:19:02.505 --> 01:19:03.471
What, fuck!

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:05.940
What's happened to you?!

01:19:05.942 --> 01:19:07.775
- There's been a little hiccup.

01:19:07.777 --> 01:19:08.642
Yslav turned up.

01:19:08.644 --> 01:19:09.744
- Did he do this?!

01:19:09.746 --> 01:19:11.345
- A little something happened.

01:19:11.347 --> 01:19:12.446
Minuscule, really.

01:19:12.448 --> 01:19:13.280
Tiny.

01:19:13.282 --> 01:19:15.249
- Jesus Christ, Adam!

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:16.317
- It was a fucking accident!

01:19:16.319 --> 01:19:17.284
He just slipped!

01:19:17.286 --> 01:19:18.119
- What?!

01:19:18.121 --> 01:19:19.353
What do we do?!

01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:20.454
- Well, we need
to get rid of it!

01:19:20.456 --> 01:19:21.489
- What?!

01:19:21.491 --> 01:19:22.556
No!

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:23.724
No, we can't do that!

01:19:23.726 --> 01:19:25.226
We have to phone the police!

01:19:25.228 --> 01:19:26.894
- Oh, we can't phone
the fucking police!

01:19:26.896 --> 01:19:28.462
I'll go to fucking jail!

01:19:28.464 --> 01:19:29.797
- Well, no, it's self-defense!

01:19:29.799 --> 01:19:31.732
That's a thing, isn't it?!

01:19:31.734 --> 01:19:32.700
They'll just tell you off!

01:19:32.702 --> 01:19:34.635
- Tell me off?!

01:19:34.637 --> 01:19:36.036
How fucking old are you?!

01:19:36.038 --> 01:19:37.238
They'll put me
cupboard-sized hole

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.707
with Killer fucking Kevin!

01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:42.009
Oi, lardy cake, where
the fuck are you going?!

01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:44.111
Now is not the time
for a fucking Mars bar!

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:45.012
- Shh!
- Fuck!

01:19:45.014 --> 01:19:46.347
- Someone will hear us!

01:19:46.349 --> 01:19:47.581
- Are you sure he's dead?

01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:49.784
- No, Gaz, I think
the large fucking dent

01:19:49.786 --> 01:19:51.685
in the side of his fucking head

01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:54.822
is a fucking fashion statement!

01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:57.691
- The diggers must've
left these behind.

01:19:57.693 --> 01:19:59.026
- No!

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:01.595
No!
- It's a cemetery, Peter.

01:20:01.597 --> 01:20:03.130
- Nope, we can't do this!

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:05.332
I am not involved
in this in any way.

01:20:05.334 --> 01:20:06.600
- Well done, fatso.

01:20:06.602 --> 01:20:08.936
Grab a spade.
- No, mate, we can't do this!

01:20:08.938 --> 01:20:11.739
- Adam could go
to jail for this!

01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:14.341
- Absolutely nothing
to do with it.

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:15.309
Nothing at all.

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:17.611
- Let's move the body.

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:19.480
(grunts)

01:20:19.482 --> 01:20:21.081
- [Peter Voiceover] There's
lots of ways to bond.

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:22.550
You could go on a
team building weekend,

01:20:22.552 --> 01:20:25.085
or meet up for a drink a
couple of times a week.

01:20:25.087 --> 01:20:26.787
No one's ever said that
a great way of bonding

01:20:26.789 --> 01:20:29.256
is to bury the body
of a Russian gangster,

01:20:29.258 --> 01:20:31.158
except maybe if you
were a gangster.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.793
- It's not deep enough.

01:20:32.795 --> 01:20:34.328
- [Peter Voiceover] From Russia.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:36.297
- It needs to be deep enough
so the foxes can't smell it.

01:20:36.299 --> 01:20:37.498
- [Peter Voiceover]
Or wherever it is

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.267
that gangsters come
from these days.

01:20:40.269 --> 01:20:43.070
- Gaz, you are not holding
your shovel properly!

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:45.306
- [Peter Voiceover] Probably
somewhere like Stockport.

01:20:45.308 --> 01:20:46.807
- It needs to be deeper!

01:20:46.809 --> 01:20:48.776
- What the fuck happened to
you not getting involved?!

01:20:48.778 --> 01:20:49.677
- I'm not!

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:51.846
I'm just suggest--

01:20:51.848 --> 01:20:54.548
- Yeah, well, I suggest
you take my spade

01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:56.917
and shove it up your ass!

01:20:56.919 --> 01:20:58.219
- Brilliant!

01:20:58.221 --> 01:20:59.620
Well done, Adam.

01:20:59.622 --> 01:21:01.422
Just the sort of
attitude we need

01:21:01.424 --> 01:21:02.690
when we're burying the body

01:21:02.692 --> 01:21:05.793
of someone you almost
sort of killed!

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:08.062
- Keep going, jizz bank.

01:21:08.064 --> 01:21:10.097
Go on, I dare you.

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:11.565
- Stop it!

01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:13.133
Both of you!

01:21:13.135 --> 01:21:16.070
For God's sake, Adam, shut up!

01:21:16.072 --> 01:21:18.439
We're doing this
to save your ass.

01:21:18.441 --> 01:21:21.308
And, Peter, why
don't you grow a pair

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:23.043
and help lift this body now!

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:24.044
- I can't, I'm not involved.

01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:25.846
- Just fucking do it!

01:21:26.749 --> 01:21:29.049
(grunting)

01:21:32.855 --> 01:21:36.790
I don't think I can live
with my mum anymore.

01:21:36.792 --> 01:21:39.860
I'm not even sure
I want to go home.

01:21:43.032 --> 01:21:45.599
What's everyone else gonna do?

01:21:50.039 --> 01:21:51.472
- Well, I'll probably
move up north

01:21:51.474 --> 01:21:55.643
with all the other homeless
and unemployed people.

01:21:56.812 --> 01:21:58.479
(Gaz sighs)

01:21:58.481 --> 01:22:03.550
- I really have to have a word
with Stacey when we get back.

01:22:04.987 --> 01:22:07.922
There's a few things that
just don't make any sense.

01:22:12.328 --> 01:22:14.962
I just don't think Elle's mine.

01:22:15.998 --> 01:22:18.732
- What makes you say that, mate?

01:22:23.306 --> 01:22:25.072
- She's a bit black.

01:22:27.944 --> 01:22:32.179
- Um, well, I suppose, now
you come to mention it.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:35.215
- And I don't think you
can have a black baby

01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:37.818
if both the parents are white.

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:38.719
Can you?

01:22:41.924 --> 01:22:43.157
- Sorry, mate.

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:49.930
What about you, Adam?

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:52.032
(sighs)

01:22:52.034 --> 01:22:53.701
- I don't know.

01:22:53.703 --> 01:22:54.902
Go back to work.

01:22:54.904 --> 01:22:57.838
Sort out all the
shit I left behind.

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:01.475
Make sure my receptionist
hasn't stuck herself to the desk

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:02.643
with a staple gun.

01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:04.979
(chuckles)

01:23:06.248 --> 01:23:09.883
- We'll stay together,
though, won't we?

01:23:09.885 --> 01:23:10.751
- Yeah.

01:23:12.355 --> 01:23:13.454
- Definitely.

01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:17.825
- Well, it's either you
lot or fucking Neville.

01:23:17.827 --> 01:23:20.461
(group laughs)

01:23:21.564 --> 01:23:22.796
Come on.

01:23:22.798 --> 01:23:26.600
Let's fill this fucking
hole in, and get home.

01:23:29.438 --> 01:23:32.072
(gentle music)

01:23:36.312 --> 01:23:38.645
- [Gaz] I knew someone whose
mum tossed off a dead body

01:23:38.647 --> 01:23:40.948
to get the sperm
and have a baby.

01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:42.649
- [Peter] No you didn't, Gaz.

01:23:42.651 --> 01:23:44.585
- [Gaz] Yes, I did,
his name was Billy.

01:23:44.587 --> 01:23:45.919
- [Peter] Billy, really?

01:23:45.921 --> 01:23:47.488
That was his real name, was it?

01:23:47.490 --> 01:23:50.090
Despite what you just said
being 100% impossible?

01:23:50.092 --> 01:23:52.192
- [Gaz] You can get
sperm from a dead body.

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:53.460
- [Peter Voiceover]
And that's how we said

01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:55.062
goodbye to Frankie.

01:23:55.064 --> 01:23:56.897
That wasn't exactly
how we planned it.

01:23:56.899 --> 01:23:58.899
There were definitely
some differences.

01:23:58.901 --> 01:24:00.634
For instance, Frankie
would've actually been alive,

01:24:00.636 --> 01:24:02.136
and we wouldn't have
had to bury the body

01:24:02.138 --> 01:24:05.806
of an angry Russian on
top of our dear friend.

01:24:05.808 --> 01:24:07.341
Actually, something like that

01:24:07.343 --> 01:24:09.543
was always bound
to have happened.

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:11.011
But we walked away
different men.

01:24:11.013 --> 01:24:12.212
- You should try it, Gaz.

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:13.447
- [Peter Voiceover]
We had changed,

01:24:13.449 --> 01:24:15.716
and we have Frankie
to thank for that.

01:24:15.718 --> 01:24:18.218
- [Gaz] Nah, that's well wrong.

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.887
Innit?

01:24:19.889 --> 01:24:22.156
I mean, you can't
really do that.

01:24:22.158 --> 01:24:24.191
- [Peter Voiceover] Okay,
we hadn't changed that much,

01:24:24.193 --> 01:24:26.960
but we definitely
weren't the same.

01:24:26.962 --> 01:24:28.362
- [Gaz] Can you?

01:24:29.365 --> 01:24:30.497
- [Peter Voiceover] Never mind.

01:24:30.499 --> 01:24:34.301
