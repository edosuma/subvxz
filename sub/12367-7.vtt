WEBVTT

00:02.460 --> 00:03.711
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>

00:03.795 --> 00:05.630
IS RECORDED IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.714 --> 00:08.216
- OKAY, SIT.

00:08.299 --> 00:10.927
YOU'LL ONLY GET THE TREAT
IF YOU SIT.

00:11.010 --> 00:13.471
SO SIT.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.890
NOW I HAVE TO SIT.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.477
- OH, WHO'S THIS GUY?

00:19.561 --> 00:21.438
WHERE DID HE COME FROM?

00:21.521 --> 00:23.064
- HE'S THE OLDEST DOG
AT THE SHELTER

00:23.148 --> 00:24.899
WHERE I VOLUNTEER.

00:24.983 --> 00:27.736
- OH, I LOVE RESCUE DOGS.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.821
THEY'RE SO GRATEFUL
AND HAPPY.

00:29.904 --> 00:32.115
I WISH
THERE WERE RESCUE MEN.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.618
- HE'LL NEVER GET ADOPTED

00:35.702 --> 00:37.954
UNLESS HE LEARNS
A CUTE TRICK OR TWO.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.629
- WELL, I SEE HE'S MASTERED
THE ART OF LICKING HIMSELF.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.131
- THANK GOD
MEN CAN'T DO THAT.

00:48.214 --> 00:51.217
IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO GET 'EM
AWAY FROM THE TV.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.137
- YOU SEE WHY THE STAFF
CALLS HIM DUMMY.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.972
OH, HE'LL BE FINE.

00:56.055 --> 00:58.308
I HAVE THE GIFT
WITH ANIMALS.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.727
I CALL IT "THE GIFT."

01:02.520 --> 01:03.980
I KNOW HOW THEY FEEL,

01:04.063 --> 01:05.857
I KNOW WHAT THEY THINK.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.942
- WHAT'S HE THINKING NOW?

01:08.026 --> 01:09.652
- WHAT WE'RE ALL THINKING--

01:09.736 --> 01:13.281
WHY DOESN'T JOY
DRESS HER AGE?

01:15.074 --> 01:16.326
- GOOD MORNING, ALL.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.827
I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.287
I'M GOING TO MAKE
A SEX TAPE,

01:19.370 --> 01:20.663
AND YOU'RE
ALL GOING TO HELP.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.209
WE BEGIN AFTER COFFEE.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.836
OH, AND WHO IS
THIS HANDSOME FELLOW?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.213
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:28.296 --> 01:29.714
- WELL, SURELY I'M
NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THE ROOM

01:29.798 --> 01:31.841
WHO SEES A DOG.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.718
- HE'S VISITING
FROM THE SHELTER.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.345
- NOW BACK TO US
SUPPOSEDLY HELPING YOU

01:35.428 --> 01:36.846
WITH A SEX TAPE.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.056
- YES. WELL, AS YOU ALL KNOW,

01:38.139 --> 01:39.724
I AM ON THE VERGE
OF FINANCIAL RUIN,

01:39.808 --> 01:41.810
AND MY AGENT SAID
THAT A LEAKED SEX TAPE

01:41.893 --> 01:43.520
COULD GENERATE
ENOUGH MEDIA BUZZ

01:43.603 --> 01:45.021
TO REALLY JUMPSTART
MY CAREER.

01:45.104 --> 01:47.398
- OKAY. SO WHO'S
THE LUCKY GUY?

01:47.482 --> 01:49.192
- ACTUALLY, MY AGENT SAID

01:49.275 --> 01:50.527
THAT THE NEW TREND
IN LEAKED SEX TAPES

01:50.610 --> 01:52.070
IS GIRL ON GIRL,

01:52.153 --> 01:53.988
AND I SAID, WELL, I KNOW
JUST THE GIRL.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.532
- DON'T LOOK AT ME!

01:57.075 --> 01:58.701
- OR ME.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.538
I'M FIGHTING THE I.N.S.
JUST TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.206
A SEX TAPE IS
THE LAST THING I NEED

02:03.289 --> 02:05.375
POPPING UP
ON MY GOOGLE SEARCH.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.418
- WELL, I WAS THINKING
OF MELANIE.

02:07.502 --> 02:08.627
- ME?

02:08.711 --> 02:09.878
[laughing]

02:09.963 --> 02:13.049
I'VE NEVER EVEN DONE IT
NEAR A MIRROR.

02:13.132 --> 02:15.218
- WAIT.
DID YOU NOT ASK ME

02:15.301 --> 02:17.095
BECAUSE I'M
NOT STACKED ENOUGH?

02:17.178 --> 02:18.388
- OH, JOY,
DON'T HATE ME.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.391
HATE THE INTERNET PERVERTS
WHO RUN HOLLYWOOD.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.393
AND I KNEW
YOU WOULD SAY NO.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.520
- HOW COME YOU DIDN'T KNOW
I'D SAY NO?

02:25.603 --> 02:26.938
- WELL, I DID,

02:27.021 --> 02:28.898
BUT IT'S JUST SO MUCH EASIER
TO WEAR YOU DOWN.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.775
- NOT THIS TIME.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.318
- OH, COME ON.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.362
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE
REALLY GONNA DO ANYTHING.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.531
I MEAN, THERE WON'T BE
ANY TOUCHING OR NUDITY.

02:36.614 --> 02:37.574
- [Elka laughs]

02:37.657 --> 02:39.909
THAT'S SOME SEX TAPE.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.579
- ALL RIGHT, I ADMIT

02:42.662 --> 02:44.747
I'M A LITTLE OUTSIDE
OF MY AREA OF EXPERTISE.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.374
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER MADE
A SEX TAPE.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.418
- I DON'T EVEN
UNDERSTAND THEM.

02:48.501 --> 02:53.590
- WELL, YOU SEE, WHEN TWO PEOPLE
LOVE EACH OTHER VERY MUCH,

02:53.673 --> 02:56.551
THEY GET A CAMERA
AND...

02:56.634 --> 02:57.594
- WAIT.

02:57.677 --> 02:58.761
WHEN WOULD YOU
EVEN WATCH IT?

02:58.845 --> 03:01.055
- AFTER <i> DEXTER.</i>

03:05.351 --> 03:06.936
- THE ONLY REASON
I'D MAKE A SEX TAPE

03:07.020 --> 03:08.563
WOULD BE
AS A TEACHING TOOL.

03:08.646 --> 03:10.231
YOU KNOW, GET ONE OF THOSE
LITTLE LASER POINTERS.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.025
"MORE OF THIS, LESS OF THAT.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.444
WHOA,
SLOW DOWN THERE, COWBOY."

03:14.527 --> 03:15.612
- [laughing]

03:15.695 --> 03:17.739
- OH, COME ON, MEL.
WE'RE FRIENDS.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.073
YOU KNOW, WE DO THINGS
FOR EACH OTHER.

03:19.157 --> 03:22.327
- YES, FOR EACH OTHER,
NOT TO EACH OTHER.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.412
- BUT YOU ASKED ME
TO BUY YOU STAMPS.

03:24.495 --> 03:25.747
- REALLY?

03:25.830 --> 03:27.624
YOU'RE COMPARING
BUYING STAMPS

03:27.707 --> 03:28.917
WITH MAKING A SEX TAPE?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.418
- NO, NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:30.501 --> 03:31.794
I MEAN, BUYING STAMPS
IS SO MUCH WORSE.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.129
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE POST OFFICE.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.714
YOU JUST
HAVE TO GO UPSTAIRS.

03:34.797 --> 03:35.965
- OKAY, NO.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.258
NO, NOT IN A MILLION YEARS.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.551
NO, NEVER.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.137
- I AM LOVING THE PASSION.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.306
- YOU KNOW, MY THERAPIST
DOESN'T BELIEVE ME

03:43.389 --> 03:44.849
WHEN I TELL HIM
THESE STORIES.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.018
- WHAT'S THAT, DEAR?

03:47.101 --> 03:52.482
DUMMY SAYS HE THINKS
YOU'RE TOO FAR GONE FOR THERAPY.

03:52.565 --> 03:56.653
- WELL, THEN GOOD-BYE,
OLD, USELESS DUMMY,

03:56.736 --> 03:58.196
AND YOUR DOG.

04:15.254 --> 04:17.005
{\an8}- OH, PERFECT!

04:17.089 --> 04:18.800
{\an8}IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK
FOR COFFEE LIDS

04:18.882 --> 04:19.841
{\an8}THAT FIT COFFEE CUPS?

04:19.926 --> 04:22.595
{\an8}- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.641
{\an8}THE PLACE DOWNSTAIRS,
RIGHT?

04:26.724 --> 04:28.309
{\an8}- AND THE LINES ARE SO LONG,

04:28.393 --> 04:30.645
{\an8}AND EVERYONE WITH THEIR
COMPLICATED DRINK ORDERS NOW.

04:30.728 --> 04:32.855
{\an8}- THIS MORNING,
I'M IN LINE FOR 20 MINUTES,

04:32.939 --> 04:34.148
{\an8}AND THE WOMAN
IN FRONT OF ME

04:34.232 --> 04:35.525
{\an8}FINALLY GETS TO THE COUNTER,

04:35.608 --> 04:36.859
{\an8}AND THE GUY SAYS,
"WHAT CAN I GET YOU?"

04:36.943 --> 04:40.863
{\an8}AND SHE SAYS,
"LET ME THINK."

04:40.947 --> 04:43.658
{\an8}I MEAN, WHAT WAS SHE THINKING
ABOUT FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES?

04:43.741 --> 04:45.702
{\an8}- AT LEAST YOUR GUY SAID,
"WHAT CAN I GET YOU?"

04:45.785 --> 04:48.037
{\an8}MINE SAID, "WHAT CAN I
DO YOU FOR?"

04:48.121 --> 04:49.539
{\an8}- I HATE THAT.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.082
{\an8}PEOPLE ARE SO ANNOYING.

04:51.165 --> 04:52.542
{\an8}- PEOPLE ARE THE WORST.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.711
{\an8}HI, I'M JOY.
- I'M GORDON.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.382
{\an8}- I'M SORRY, BUT WHAT TIME
IS YOUR APPOINTMENT?

04:59.465 --> 05:00.550
{\an8}- IT'S 12:00.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.552
{\an8}- MINE MUST BE 1:00.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.220
{\an8}I HATE BLOODY
DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME.

05:04.303 --> 05:06.389
{\an8}- ME, TOO.
IT'S LIKE JET LAG,

05:06.472 --> 05:07.932
{\an8}BUT YOU DON'T
GET TO GO ANYWHERE.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.226
{\an8}- THAT WOULD MAKE
A GOOD TWEET.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.895
{\an8}- I HATE TWITTER.
- ME, TOO!

05:12.979 --> 05:14.897
{\an8}OKAY, I'M GONNA GO OUT
ON A LIMB HERE.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.190
{\an8}RECYCLING.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.567
{\an8}- HATE IT.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.569
{\an8}I MEAN, I DO IT,
BUT IT'S SO ANNOYING.

05:19.652 --> 05:23.364
{\an8}- IT'S LIKE
HIGH-MAINTENANCE GARBAGE.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.658
{\an8}- YOU KNOW,
I KNOW WHY I'M HERE,

05:25.742 --> 05:27.744
{\an8}BUT I DON'T SEE
HOW A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN LIKE YOU

05:27.827 --> 05:30.079
{\an8}COULD POSSIBLY NEED
A THERAPIST.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.581
{\an8}I WOULD THINK YOU COULD
JUST SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS

05:31.664 --> 05:33.583
{\an8}BY LOOKING IN THE MIRROR.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.585
{\an8}UNLESS YOUR PROBLEM'S
NARCISSISM.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.795
{\an8}[both laughing]

05:37.879 --> 05:39.797
{\an8}SO WHY ARE YOU SEEING
DR. MORGAN?

05:39.881 --> 05:41.466
{\an8}- I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T
KNOW YOU THAT WELL.

05:41.549 --> 05:42.425
{\an8}- THAT'S TRUE.

05:42.508 --> 05:45.219
{\an8}I COULD BE SOME KIND
OF VIOLENT PSYCHOPATH

05:45.303 --> 05:46.471
{\an8}IN NEED
OF SERIOUS TREATMENT.

05:46.554 --> 05:47.930
{\an8}- [laughing]

05:48.014 --> 05:50.558
{\an8}ARE YOU?

05:50.641 --> 05:51.559
{\an8}- NO.

05:51.642 --> 05:52.602
{\an8}YOU?

05:52.685 --> 05:53.936
{\an8}- JOY?
- NO.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.438
{\an8}- WHAT?
- I'M SORRY.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.564
{\an8}I WAS ANSWERING
HIS QUESTION.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.775
{\an8}NO, I'M NOT A PSYCHOPATH.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.151
{\an8}RIGHT, DR. MORGAN?

06:00.234 --> 06:01.319
{\an8}- YOU KNOW I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT SPECIFICS

06:01.402 --> 06:02.653
{\an8}IN FRONT OF PATIENTS.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.822
{\an8}- YES, BUT YOU CAN
SAY THAT MUCH, CAN'T YOU?

06:04.906 --> 06:06.240
{\an8}"SHE'S NOT A PSYCHOPATH."

06:06.324 --> 06:07.784
{\an8}I'M GIVING YOU PERMISSION.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.786
{\an8}- JOY, ISN'T YOUR APPOINTMENT
AN HOUR FROM NOW?

06:09.869 --> 06:10.912
{\an8}- [sighs]

06:10.995 --> 06:12.288
{\an8}- LET'S TALK
ABOUT IT THEN, OKAY?

06:12.371 --> 06:14.123
{\an8}- OKAY.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.417
{\an8}BUT I'M NOT A PSYCHOPATH.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.585
{\an8}- GORDON?

06:21.214 --> 06:22.548
- I'LL SEE YOU
IN AN HOUR?

06:22.632 --> 06:24.550
- SEE YOU IN AN HOUR.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.976
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M GONNA DOUBLE UP NEXT WEEK.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.478
I'D RATHER SPEND
THE NEXT HOUR WITH YOU.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.313
YOU LIKE MEXICAN FOOD?

06:37.396 --> 06:38.314
- HATE IT.
- ME, TOO.

06:38.397 --> 06:39.690
- OH!

06:42.193 --> 06:43.861
- IT'S CHILLY IN HERE.

06:43.945 --> 06:47.323
I'LL EITHER HAVE TO GET
MY SWEATER OR KNIT FASTER.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.158
- I'LL TURN UP
THE THERMOSTAT

06:49.242 --> 06:50.910
AS SOON AS I
FINISH THESE BILLS.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.710
AND I'M OUT OF STAMPS.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.004
WHO DO YOU HAVE TO SLEEP WITH
IN THIS PLACE TO GET STAMPS?

07:02.088 --> 07:04.841
OH, YEAH--VICTORIA.

07:04.924 --> 07:08.553
- OH, HERE'S MY SWEATER
RIGHT HERE.

07:10.429 --> 07:12.807
OH, POOR DUMMY.

07:12.890 --> 07:16.477
THE ONLY THING
HE <i> CAN</i> DO IS SHED.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.355
- I JUST MET
THE GREATEST GUY.

07:19.438 --> 07:21.482
- OH, CONGRATULATIONS.
WHERE?

07:21.566 --> 07:23.067
- AT MY THERAPIST'S OFFICE.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.611
- OH, A MORE CAUTIOUS
CONGRATULATIONS.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.613
- NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.657
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,
HE'S SCREWED UP,

07:29.740 --> 07:31.534
BUT WE HAD
SUCH A CONNECTION.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.369
THERE'S A CHANCE
WE ARE SCREWED UP

07:33.452 --> 07:35.663
IN COMPLETELY
COMPLIMENTARY WAYS.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.498
- WHAT'S HE LIKE?

07:37.582 --> 07:39.250
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.836
- WHAT ARE ALL THOSE FILES?

07:41.919 --> 07:44.714
- WHEN DR. MORGAN LEFT
TO TAKE A PHONE CALL,

07:44.797 --> 07:47.592
I NOTICED GORDON'S FILES
ON HIS DESK,

07:47.675 --> 07:50.219
SO LET'S DIVIDE THEM UP
AND LOOK FOR RED FLAGS.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.345
- ALL RIGHT.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.097
- YOU STOLE HIS FILES?

07:53.181 --> 07:54.515
ISN'T THAT
A LITTLE UNETHICAL?

07:54.599 --> 07:56.642
- I KNOW, AND I WOULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT,

07:56.726 --> 07:58.561
BUT I MIGHT BE
DEPORTED IN A MONTH,

07:58.644 --> 08:00.563
AND I DON'T HAVE TWO YEARS
TO GET TO KNOW HIM

08:00.646 --> 08:02.398
TO SEE IF HE'S
MARRIAGE MATERIAL OR NOT.

08:02.481 --> 08:04.066
- WELL, I THINK
IT'S BRILLIANT.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.110
I WISH I'D SEEN
MY THIRD EX-HUSBAND'S FILES

08:06.194 --> 08:07.570
BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.739
ALTHOUGH, I SUPPOSE
HE COULD HAVE HID

08:09.822 --> 08:11.908
HIS BEING GAY
EVEN FROM HIS THERAPIST.

08:11.991 --> 08:15.244
- HE WAS PRESIDENT
OF THE VICTORIA CHASE FAN CLUB.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.122
I DON'T THINK HE WAS
HIDING IT FROM ANYONE.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.542
- THE FAN CLUB HASN'T BEEN
THE SAME SINCE WE LOST HIM.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.713
- THIS PERSON'S A PSYCHO!

08:25.796 --> 08:29.217
- THAT'S MY FILE!

08:32.135 --> 08:33.804
- YOU STOLE
YOUR FILE, TOO?

08:33.888 --> 08:34.931
- WOULDN'T YOU?

08:35.014 --> 08:37.265
- WELL, YEAH,
I WOULD, YEAH.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.934
- OH, THIS IS GREAT.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.187
IT SAYS GORDON
LIKES ASSERTIVE WOMEN.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.313
I'M ASSERTIVE.

08:42.395 --> 08:43.648
I STOLE THESE FILES.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.777
- OOH, IT SAYS HE'S READY
TO GET MARRIED SOON,

08:47.860 --> 08:48.986
SO NO COMMITMENT ISSUES.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.279
- [gasps]

08:50.363 --> 08:52.615
AND HERE ARE
HIS SEX FANTASIES.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.284
OH, LOOK, A PARTICULAR
FAVORITE OF YOURS, I BELIEVE.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.786
- YES!

08:56.869 --> 08:58.788
I WON'T EVEN NEED
A LASER POINTER.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.456
- OH, AND HE ALSO HAS

09:00.539 --> 09:02.250
THE STANDARD
GIRL-ON-GIRL FANTASIES

09:02.333 --> 09:03.918
THAT EVERYONE LOVES.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.087
- NOT EVERYONE.

09:06.170 --> 09:09.340
- OH. HE HATES WALKS
ON THE BEACH, TOO.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.468
- AGAIN, THIS IS
ALL ABOUT MY CAREER.

09:12.551 --> 09:14.470
I MEAN, THE SEX
IS JUST SIMULATION.

09:14.553 --> 09:18.474
IT'S ONLY MY DESPERATION
THAT'S REAL.

09:18.557 --> 09:20.685
- UH-OH. THIS SAYS
GORDON HAS--

09:20.768 --> 09:22.478
- OH, PLEASE, DON'T SAY
PEANUT ALLERGY.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.688
THAT JUST FREAKS ME OUT.

09:23.771 --> 09:24.605
THEY EAT THE WRONG THING,

09:24.689 --> 09:26.315
THEIR HEAD SWELLS UP
LIKE A BASKETBALL,

09:26.399 --> 09:27.984
AND THERE GOES
YOUR EVENING.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.778
- NO, HE HAS
A HEIGHTENED FEAR

09:30.861 --> 09:33.698
OF BEING SPIED ON
OR WATCHED.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.658
- THAT'S ALL?

09:35.741 --> 09:37.660
- DON'T YOU SEE?

09:37.743 --> 09:39.287
WE'RE DOING
WHAT HE FEARS MOST.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.289
WE'RE MAKING
HIS NIGHTMARES COME TRUE.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.499
- [Elka laughs]

09:43.582 --> 09:45.751
HEY, I'M IN YOUR FILE.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.339
P.S. RIGHT BACK AT YA.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.383
[doorbell chimes]

09:52.466 --> 09:54.552
- OH, THAT MUST BE
JASMINE BREEZE.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.137
- WHO?

09:56.220 --> 09:58.472
- WELL, WHEN YOU WOULDN'T
CO-STAR IN MY FAKE SEX TAPE,

09:58.556 --> 10:00.016
I HIRED A PROFESSIONAL.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.851
- YOU HIRED A HOOKER?

10:01.934 --> 10:04.854
- SHE COMES FROM
A VERY CLASSY ESCORT SERVICE.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.523
- YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE
THE A-S-S IN "CLASSY"

10:07.606 --> 10:09.358
IS CAPITALIZED.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.445
- ALL RIGHT, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS HOLD THE CAMERA.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.030
HERE'S THE POWER BUTTON,

10:14.113 --> 10:16.032
AND THERE'S THE ZOOM,
AND...

10:16.115 --> 10:17.366
OH, ALTHOUGH IT'S HIGH DEF,

10:17.450 --> 10:19.201
SO, YOU KNOW, DON'T ZOOM.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.720
- YOU WANT A CUP OF TEA?

10:39.180 --> 10:40.139
- I'M GOOD.

10:42.099 --> 10:44.185
- YOU KNOW, UM,
WHILE WE'RE WAITING,

10:44.268 --> 10:45.853
I'M JUST--
I'VE BEEN WONDERING SOMETHING.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.356
SEE, I'M OUT
IN THE DATING WORLD AGAIN

10:48.439 --> 10:49.565
AFTER A VERY LONG MARRIAGE,

10:49.649 --> 10:51.901
AND, UM, WELL,
YOU WOULD KNOW,

10:51.984 --> 10:54.445
WHAT IS IT THAT GUYS ARE
REALLY LOOKING FOR THESE DAYS?

10:54.528 --> 10:58.908
- WELL, IT'S MORE
WHAT YOU SAY THAN WHAT YOU DO.

11:00.659 --> 11:02.286
- OH.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.247
- BUT YOU STILL
GOTTA DO IT, TOO.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.540
- RIGHT, GOT IT.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.250
[laughs]

11:08.334 --> 11:10.711
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THE MOST
EROTIC ORGAN IS THE BRAIN.

11:10.795 --> 11:14.382
- YEAH, I GET A LOT
OF REQUESTS FOR THE BRAIN.

11:16.884 --> 11:17.760
- I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.095
I WAS JUST PUTTING
THE FINISHING TOUCHES

11:19.178 --> 11:20.971
ON THE SCRIPT.
- SCRIPT?

11:21.055 --> 11:22.306
UH...

11:22.390 --> 11:24.350
"I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M MAKING LOVE

11:24.433 --> 11:27.144
TO DAYTIME EMMY-WINNER
VICTORIA CHASE."

11:27.228 --> 11:29.063
- DO PEOPLE REALLY TALK
ABOUT YOUR AWARDS

11:29.146 --> 11:29.855
WHEN THEY'RE
IN BED WITH YOU?

11:29.939 --> 11:32.817
- WELL, THEY DO
IF THEY'RE SMART.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.236
- WAIT. SCRIPT, CAMERA, UH...

11:35.319 --> 11:37.780
I GET PAID EXTRA
FOR BEING A PORN STAR.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.156
- NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.075
WHY IS EVERYONE
IN PORN A "STAR"?

11:41.158 --> 11:43.244
ARE THERE NO
PORN CHARACTER ACTORS?

11:43.327 --> 11:47.123
- LOOK, JASMINE BREEZE,
I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE MONEY.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.457
NOW, THIS VIDEO
IS GONNA GET ME WORK,

11:48.541 --> 11:50.084
AND WHEN I GET PAID,
I PROMISE THAT I'LL PAY YOU.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.460
- [laughs] PROMISE?

11:51.544 --> 11:55.756
PROMISES DON'T PAY
MY TUITION TO LAW SCHOOL.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.466
- YOU'RE IN LAW SCHOOL?

11:57.550 --> 12:00.928
- WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE
THE GRADES FOR DENTAL SCHOOL.

12:01.011 --> 12:02.847
NO VIDEO
UNLESS YOU PAY DOUBLE.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.515
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST GO.

12:04.598 --> 12:09.103
AND REST ASSURED, I WOULD HAVE
ACTED YOUR ASS OFF.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.981
- I GET PAID EXTRA
FOR THAT, TOO.

12:13.732 --> 12:14.650
- [sighs]

12:14.733 --> 12:19.155
WELL, THIS IS AWKWARD.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.823
- NO.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.497
- MY PROBLEM
WITH MODERN ART IS

12:28.581 --> 12:29.623
THAT IF I COULD DO IT,

12:29.707 --> 12:30.833
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE ART TO ME.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.334
- MM-HMM.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.378
- I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE INSULTED

12:34.462 --> 12:37.715
THAT ONE PIECE SO LOUDLY
IN THAT ECHOING LOBBY.

12:37.798 --> 12:38.632
- WELL, HOW COULD YOU KNOW

12:38.716 --> 12:41.010
THE ARTIST WAS STANDING
RIGHT BEHIND US?

12:41.093 --> 12:43.179
- AND I SUPPOSE
THAT THIRD-GRADE CLASS

12:43.262 --> 12:46.515
WAS GOING TO LEARN
THOSE WORDS EVENTUALLY, RIGHT?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.309
- LOOK, I KNOW
WE'VE ONLY BEEN DATING

12:48.392 --> 12:50.227
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS,

12:50.311 --> 12:52.521
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I'D REALLY LIKE TO ASK YOU.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.190
- YES.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.192
YOU CAN EAT THE FRENCH FRIES
OFF MY PLATE.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.359
- THANK YOU.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.487
[laughs]

12:59.570 --> 13:00.738
MMM.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.990
THIS IS A REAL SENSE MEMORY.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.408
YOU KNOW,
I WAS A CHUBBY KID,

13:04.492 --> 13:06.452
SO MY PARENTS WOULDN'T
LET ME ORDER THEM.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.287
BUT MY SISTER
WOULD LET ME EAT HERS

13:08.370 --> 13:09.413
OFF OF HER PLATE.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.665
I REALLY LOVED HER
FOR THAT.

13:11.749 --> 13:16.003
- WHAT A LUCKY THING
I ORDERED THEM THEN.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.755
- YOU KNOW ME SO WELL.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.925
IT'S LIKE WE MET
IN A PAST LIFE OR SOMETHING.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.177
I MEAN,
WE HAVE CUT THROUGH MONTHS

13:23.260 --> 13:24.595
OF THAT GETTING
TO KNOW YOU BUSINESS,

13:24.678 --> 13:27.848
AND WE'RE CONNECTING
ON THE BIG STUFF.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.683
- THIS FEELS
REALLY RIGHT, DOESN'T IT?

13:29.767 --> 13:31.268
- IT DOES.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.901
I LOVE AN ASSERTIVE WOMAN.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.903
- I KNOW.
- HMM?

13:40.986 --> 13:43.364
- NOW.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.449
BECAUSE YOU JUST SAID IT.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.659
KISS ME AGAIN.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.664
- WELL, I SUPPOSE
I COULD GET PUBLICITY

13:51.747 --> 13:53.290
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY--

13:53.374 --> 13:55.918
SHOPLIFTING.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.712
WELL, WINONA RYDER
GOT A LOT OF PRESS.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.756
- SERIOUSLY?
BREAKING THE LAW?

14:00.839 --> 14:01.924
- AW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.093
I'D JUST LOOK
LIKE A COPYCAT.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.136
- OOH, YOU COULD
PUNCH OUT A PAPARAZZI.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.389
- IF WE HAD PAPARAZZI
AROUND

14:08.472 --> 14:09.974
THEN I WOULDN'T
NEED THE ATTENTION.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.685
MELANIE, WHERE IS YOUR HEAD?

14:12.768 --> 14:13.769
- [gasps]

14:13.852 --> 14:16.272
HAVING TOM BRADY'S BABY
MIGHT BE FUN.

14:16.355 --> 14:19.775
- NOW YOU'RE THINKING.

14:19.858 --> 14:21.986
HEY, HOW WAS
YOUR DATE WITH GORDON?

14:22.069 --> 14:23.696
- WONDERFUL.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.072
- UH-OH, WHAT'S WRONG?

14:25.155 --> 14:26.740
HERE.

14:26.824 --> 14:30.077
- TELL US ALL ABOUT IT.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.621
- I REALLY, REALLY
LIKE THIS GUY,

14:32.705 --> 14:35.833
AND NOT JUST FROM HIS FILES,
BUT FOR WHO HE REALLY IS.

14:35.916 --> 14:38.627
SO I'VE DECIDED I HAVE TO BE
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH HIM.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.463
- YOU'RE GONNA TELL HIM
THAT YOU TOOK HIS FILE?

14:41.547 --> 14:43.007
- OH, GOD, NO,
HE'LL NEVER KNOW THAT,

14:43.090 --> 14:44.883
OR MY REAL BIRTHDAY.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.598
NO, I NEED TO TELL HIM
I MIGHT BE DEPORTED SOON,

14:50.681 --> 14:52.641
AND I'M SCARED OF
WHAT HIS REACTION MIGHT BE.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.268
- HE'S GONNA BE CRUSHED.

14:54.351 --> 14:55.269
- YEAH,
JUST LIKE WE ARE.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.645
- YEAH,
BUT WHAT IF HE'S NOT?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.480
WHAT OF HE SAYS,
"OH, THAT'S TOO BAD,

14:58.564 --> 14:59.481
IT'S BEEN FUN,"

14:59.565 --> 15:01.483
INSTEAD OF
MY SECRET CRAZY WISH

15:01.567 --> 15:03.152
WHERE HE SAYS,
"LET'S GET MARRIED

15:03.235 --> 15:04.945
"AND GET YOU A GREEN CARD

15:05.029 --> 15:06.655
AND WORK THIS ALL OUT"?

15:06.739 --> 15:09.491
- WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK
YOUR THERAPIST HOW TO TELL HIM.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.661
- OR BETTER YET, TELL GORDON
AT THE THERAPIST'S OFFICE.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.163
THAT WAY IF HE DUMPS ME,

15:14.246 --> 15:17.416
AT LEAST I'LL HAVE
SOMEWHERE TO CRY FOR AN HOUR.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.837
- I WAS LOOKING FOR DUMMY.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.505
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

15:23.589 --> 15:25.591
- OH, WE'RE JUST
ALL FEELING A LITTLE SAD.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.843
- ALL RIGHT, ALREADY,

15:27.926 --> 15:31.055
I'LL DO YOUR SEX TAPE.

15:40.064 --> 15:40.981
- OH, GOD!

15:41.065 --> 15:42.399
REALLY?

15:42.483 --> 15:43.567
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

15:43.651 --> 15:44.693
I BROUGHT TWO.

15:44.777 --> 15:45.861
- HEY.

15:45.944 --> 15:47.196
- AND THEY'RE
NOT MADE OF PAPER,

15:47.279 --> 15:49.198
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO RECYCLE.
- [laughs]

15:49.281 --> 15:52.159
JOY, DID I GET THE TIME
WRONG THIS TIME?

15:52.242 --> 15:53.744
- NO.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.579
I KNEW YOU'D BE HERE,
AND...

15:55.663 --> 15:56.914
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.582
- OKAY.

15:58.666 --> 15:59.875
- WELL, IT'S NOT DEFINITE,

15:59.958 --> 16:02.836
BUT I'M HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH MY GREEN CARD.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.046
AND THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

16:04.129 --> 16:06.215
I MIGHT BE DEPORTED
VERY SOON.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.216
- OH.

16:07.299 --> 16:10.386
WOW.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.262
WELL, WE CAN'T
LET THAT HAPPEN.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.597
I MEAN, I DON'T
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.891
- I'M SO RELIEVED
YOU SAID THAT.

16:15.974 --> 16:17.893
- YOU COULD STAY, RIGHT,
IF SOMEONE MARRIED YOU,

16:17.976 --> 16:18.894
LIKE IN THOSE MOVIES.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.104
OH, I HATE THOSE MOVIES,

16:20.187 --> 16:21.230
BUT I WOULD DO THAT.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.606
- I HATE THOSE MOVIES, TOO,

16:22.690 --> 16:23.941
BUT I WOULD
LET YOU DO IT.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.526
- I MEAN, WE HATE TOO MANY
OF THE SAME THINGS

16:25.609 --> 16:26.777
NOT TO STAY TOGETHER.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.278
CIRQUE DU SOLEIL.
- JAZZ.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.530
- FLYING.
- FLYING?

16:29.613 --> 16:30.906
- OH, YEAH,
DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT?

16:30.989 --> 16:32.908
DEATHLY AFRAID,
CAN'T GET ON A PLANE.

16:32.991 --> 16:34.535
- THAT WASN'T
IN YOUR FILES.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.086
I WENT FROM "I LOVE YOU"
TO A RESTRAINING ORDER

16:44.169 --> 16:46.255
IN UNDER TEN MINUTES.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.717
ON THE PLUS SIDE,
THAT'S A PERSONAL BEST FOR ME.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.301
- HONEY, I'M SO SORRY.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.761
- OH, SO AM I.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.055
- I SWEAR, I HAVEN'T
FELT THIS HURT

16:55.139 --> 16:57.433
SINCE KYLE STOOD ME UP
AT THE ALTAR.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.226
I KNOW IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.104
I'VE ONLY KNOWN
GORDON FOR A FEW WEEKS.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.939
I WONDER WHAT DR. MORGAN
WOULD SAY

17:04.021 --> 17:06.400
IF HE WERE
STILL SPEAKING TO ME.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.776
- HE'D SAY
YOU'RE FINALLY

17:07.859 --> 17:09.987
LETTING YOUR
INTIMACY BARRIERS DOWN.

17:10.069 --> 17:12.573
- AND ALLOWING YOURSELF
TO FEEL PAIN.

17:12.656 --> 17:13.949
IT'S A REAL STEP FORWARD

17:14.031 --> 17:15.742
IN DEALING WITH
YOUR ABANDONMENT ISSUES.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.618
- MMM, IT HAS BEEN
A RECURRING THEME

17:17.703 --> 17:19.329
IN YOUR LAST TEN SESSIONS.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.171
- YOU ALL READ MY FILE.

17:27.253 --> 17:29.923
- WOULDN'T YOU?

17:30.007 --> 17:32.468
- YES.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.469
AND MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.764
MAYBE I HAVE MADE
A LITTLE EMOTIONAL PROGRESS.

17:36.847 --> 17:41.059
I GUESS I SHOULD BE HAPPY
I'M SO MISERABLE.

17:43.604 --> 17:46.440
- OH HO HO.

17:46.523 --> 17:50.277
DUMMY SAYS HE FEELS
BAD FOR YOU.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.362
WHAT'S THAT, DUMMY?

17:52.446 --> 17:56.658
THERE'S A PITCHER OF MARGARITAS
TRAPPED IN THE FRIDGE?

18:02.247 --> 18:05.751
- [Elka laughs]

18:05.834 --> 18:08.796
WELL, FLOOZIES,

18:08.879 --> 18:11.507
DUMMY HAS A HOME
RIGHT HERE.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.300
- OH, YAY!

18:13.383 --> 18:14.384
THAT'S WONDERFUL.
- YAY!

18:14.468 --> 18:19.056
- AND LOOK
HOW HAPPY HE IS.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.142
- WELL, WE FINALLY HAVE
A MAN IN THE HOUSE.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.186
- AND HE'S BIG AND HAIRY
LIKE A CLEVELAND MAN.

18:24.269 --> 18:27.147
- AND FRIGHTENED
OF THE THUNDER

18:27.231 --> 18:30.484
LIKE AN L.A. MAN.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.860
- EVEN IF HE CAN'T
DO ANYTHING ELSE,

18:31.944 --> 18:33.028
HE MADE ME FEEL BETTER.

18:33.111 --> 18:35.656
- MAYBE HE CAN CONSOLE US
WHEN ONE OF US LOSES A MAN.

18:35.739 --> 18:38.408
- OH, GET YOUR REST, DUMMY.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.037
[cell phone chimes]

18:42.120 --> 18:44.081
- OOH.

18:44.164 --> 18:47.042
OH, MY AGENT SAYS TO HOLD OFF
ON THE SEX TAPE.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.920
THERE MIGHT BE AN OPENING
ON <i> CELEBRITY REHAB.</i>

18:57.970 --> 19:00.722
OH, THEY JUST WANT
TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ADDICTION

19:00.806 --> 19:03.183
IS GONNA GET ME
THE MOST CAMERA TIME.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.688
HOW COME I CAN'T RESTART
MY CAREER?

19:07.771 --> 19:09.773
- AND HOW COME I CAN'T
HANG ONTO A MAN?

19:09.857 --> 19:11.775
- AND HOW COME EVERY TIME
I DRINK MARGARITAS,

19:11.859 --> 19:14.069
I FEEL LIKE I COULD
HAVE SEX WITH ANYONE?

19:15.737 --> 19:18.240
- NOW YOU TELL ME?

19:18.323 --> 19:20.951
