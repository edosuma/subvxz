-THANK YOU.

29:01.304 --> 29:03.567
AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW,
MATT'S ATTENDING
ROOKIE SCHOOL.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.569
AND WELL, HE HAD
A LITTLE PROBLEM

29:05.700 --> 29:08.659
WITH ONE OF OUR OTHER
LIEUTENANTS YESTERDAY
AND HE RAN OFF.

29:10.139 --> 29:12.228
-MATTHEW HAS A DIFFICULT TIME
WITH AUTHORITY.

29:12.359 --> 29:14.578
HE'S... SENSITIVE BOY.

29:16.189 --> 29:18.321
-I THINK MATTHEW NEEDS
TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY

29:18.452 --> 29:20.149
FOR HIMSELF,
FOR HIS OWN BEHAVIOR.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.326
-AND YOU BELIEVE
THAT BECOMING A LIFEGUARD

29:23.457 --> 29:24.850
WILL HELP HIM
DEVELOP THAT?

29:24.980 --> 29:26.677
-ABSOLUTELY.

29:27.287 --> 29:29.637
WHEN YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE SAFETY OF THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE ON THE BEACH,

29:29.768 --> 29:30.899
YOU HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.902
-AND IF YOU'RE INCAPABLE
OF RESPONSIBILITY,

29:34.033 --> 29:36.165
YOU'D BE PUTTING
THOSE PEOPLE'S LIVES
IN DANGER, RIGHT?

29:37.950 --> 29:38.951
-MR. BRODY,

29:40.430 --> 29:41.649
I BELIEVE IN MATT.

29:43.129 --> 29:45.871
GIVEN HALF A CHANCE,
I THINK HE COULD START
BELIEVING IN HIMSELF.

29:48.961 --> 29:50.440
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE I MIGHT FIND HIM?

29:50.571 --> 29:52.051
I'D SURE LIKE
TO TALK TO HIM.
-YES.

29:52.616 --> 29:54.227
OFF GETTING IN TROUBLE
SOMEWHERE.

29:55.706 --> 29:57.360
-HE MAY HAVE GONE SURFING.

29:57.491 --> 29:58.927
HIS BOARD WAS MISSING
THIS MORNING.

29:59.754 --> 30:00.755
-THANK YOU.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.029
MATT, WAIT UP.

30:16.553 --> 30:17.903
-HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

30:18.033 --> 30:19.600
-I JUST CAME
FROM YOUR HOUSE.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.863
HAD A LITTLE TALK
WITH YOUR PARENTS.

30:22.864 --> 30:25.562
-MY FATHER GIVES NEW MEANING
TO THE PHRASE "FAMILY MAN,"
DOESN'T HE?

30:25.693 --> 30:27.260
-[CHUCKLES]

30:27.390 --> 30:30.176
HE THINKS YOU'RE A QUITTER.
-WHAT DO YOU THINK?

30:31.177 --> 30:32.352
-I THINK YOU'RE AFRAID
TO WIN.

30:32.482 --> 30:34.223
-I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING.

30:34.354 --> 30:35.181
-THEN SHOW ME!

30:35.311 --> 30:36.965
SHOW YOUR DAD.

30:38.749 --> 30:39.794
SHOW YOURSELF.

30:40.490 --> 30:42.536
-WHY IS MY BEING A LIFEGUARD
SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?

30:44.016 --> 30:46.670
-BECAUSE YOU REMIND ME
OF A YOUNG HOTHEAD
I ONCE KNEW

30:47.497 --> 30:48.803
WHO HAD A PROBLEM
WITH HIS DAD.

30:48.934 --> 30:50.370
-EDDIE KRAMER?

30:52.111 --> 30:52.938
