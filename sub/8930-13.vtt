IT SHOT DOWN THE ARK BEFORE CRASHING ITSELF

01:11.077 --> 01:11.977
SOMEWHERE ON THIS PLANET.

THAT IS THE MOST POWERFUL DECEPTICON WARSHIP

01:48.350 --> 01:50.317
IN TRANSFORMER HISTORY.

OH, YES.

03:52.138 --> 03:53.805
MINDLESS DESTRUCTION.

03:53.904 --> 03:56.538
GOOD FOR THE SPARK, I ALWAYS SAY.

03:56.638 --> 04:01.672
- MY OWN SPARK HAS CHANGED.

04:01.773 --> 04:05.873
IT FEELS AT LAST...COMPLETE.

04:05.973 --> 04:08.206
- YES, THE DESTRUCTION OF RAMPAGE, NO DOUBT.

04:08.306 --> 04:10.174
BRING US AROUND. VECTOR 6-2.

04:10.274 --> 04:12.674
ON THE DOUBLE.

04:17.142 --> 04:18.942

04:19.041 --> 04:21.143
- QUICKLY, GO TO YOUR FELLOW MAXIMALS.

04:21.243 --> 04:22.675
PREPARE THEM.

04:22.776 --> 04:26.543
IF MEGATRON DESTROYS THE ARK AND ITS OCCUPANTS,

04:26.643 --> 04:29.910
HISTORY AS WE KNOW IT WILL UNRAVEL.

04:30.010 --> 04:32.111

04:32.210 --> 04:33.544
- PERHAPS.

04:33.644 --> 04:36.712
BUT IT IS MY DESTINY TO TRY.

04:36.812 --> 04:39.445
I WILL HOLD THE LINE HERE.

04:39.545 --> 04:41.613
GO!

04:41.713 --> 04:43.446

04:43.546 --> 04:46.380
WHAT THE HECK'S THAT? AND, UH...

04:46.480 --> 04:47.813
HOW COME I NEVER HEARD OF IT?

04:47.913 --> 04:51.148
- [grunts] CAN WE DISCUSS THIS LATER, RATTRAP?

04:51.248 --> 04:52.181
- EH. OOH!

04:52.281 --> 04:54.014
AH! COME ON.

04:54.114 --> 04:56.715

05:00.916 --> 05:05.983
MAN, YOU KNOW HOW MANY PIECES OF WASPINATOR I GOT?

05:06.083 --> 05:09.383
- RATTRAP, WE MAY HAVE TO MOVE THE ARK.

05:09.483 --> 05:13.117

05:41.789 --> 05:45.756
MY FORECAST WAS FOR CLEAR SKIES ALL THE WAY BACK TO CYBERTRON.

05:57.358 --> 06:03.160
- A BRAVE STAND...AND NOBLE.

06:03.260 --> 06:04.759
- AH, PERHAPS.

06:04.859 --> 06:09.061

HAUNTINGLY FAMILIAR.

08:04.813 --> 08:06.780
BUT WHY?

08:06.879 --> 08:08.146

09:21.892 --> 09:24.826
- ALMOST ALL THE EQUIPMENT'S ABOARD,

09:24.926 --> 09:27.960
