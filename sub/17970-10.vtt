WEBVTT

00:39.123 --> 00:41.999
I really wish you had come to me first.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.254
Anne is prone to delusions.
You can't believe a word she says.

00:46.422 --> 00:47.463
Really?

00:47.631 --> 00:50.007
She told us the only way
to replicate your apples...

00:50.175 --> 00:53.052
...is by grafting a special root-stock
you call Mother.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.432
Be honest with me.

00:57.599 --> 01:00.977
Why is Mother so important to you?

01:01.145 --> 01:04.939
How many dead? Fifty? A hundred?

01:05.107 --> 01:06.149
It's nothing.

01:06.316 --> 01:09.110
Ilaria believes
overpopulation is unsustainable.

01:09.278 --> 01:10.945
And in three days, they plan to act.

01:11.113 --> 01:13.364
I wanna present
Michael's infertility grafting...

01:13.532 --> 01:15.616
...as an alternative to global genocide.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.536
I can't do that without Mother.

01:18.704 --> 01:21.414
-That's quite a story.
-It's the truth.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.332
How much do you want for Mother?

01:24.877 --> 01:27.128
I'm not interested in money.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.467
I only want one thing.

01:32.885 --> 01:36.721
To see the world through silver eyes.

01:37.222 --> 01:43.561
Like Michael and Dr. Jordan and you.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.106
I noticed your contacts
the moment you arrived.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.818
I can make you immortal.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.238
If you can deliver the root.

01:56.241 --> 02:01.204
Well, I must first ease concerns
among the Fellowship.

02:01.830 --> 02:07.210
But we shall reconvene later,
in my office.

02:09.630 --> 02:15.384
If you're lying, I'll make sure
the only world you see is pitch black.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.170
We searched every inch. No red sap.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.673
We'll do one last sweep of the perimeter,
move out.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.924
And the boy, Soren?

02:55.092 --> 02:57.677
Considering what he's been through
he's doing okay.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.388
Tell your men to keep him close.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.892
He's the only one to have fully recovered
from the fungus.

03:05.060 --> 03:10.648
His immunity might be the key to turning
the red sap treatment into an actual cure.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.525
How's Dr. Sommer holding up?

03:13.777 --> 03:17.363
I'd say he has 48 hours, if that.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.074
As soon as I get a sat signal,
we'll call for evac.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.826
And the supplies I ordered?

03:21.994 --> 03:24.745
Everything you need
to take down this disease is in my ship.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.998
He'll have a better chance
at a real facility.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.625
He won't have any chance
if we don't find that tree.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.587
Dr. Kyle.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.255
-Dr. Kyle.
-No. No.

03:34.423 --> 03:37.383
-Soren. Soren.
-Don't do that.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.176
Come here.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.722
Look, Dr. Kyle's
not feeling very well right now.

03:42.890 --> 03:43.973
Is he all right?

03:44.141 --> 03:46.309
We're just being extra careful. All right?

03:46.476 --> 03:51.314
I want you to stay away from him until we
can get him some of that-- That red sap.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.066
But why not just bring him
to the Bleeding Tree?

04:07.539 --> 04:10.499
I'm so sorry, Landry.

04:10.667 --> 04:14.211
I have failed you just like the others.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.840
I should have done more
to protect you.

04:21.011 --> 04:24.055
And what could you
have possibly done?

04:30.145 --> 04:31.938
I have to get back to my duties.

04:37.152 --> 04:41.364
And what are those exactly?

04:43.241 --> 04:45.868
Mother is missing, Amy.

04:46.161 --> 04:49.163
I'm going to make sure
she doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

04:53.335 --> 04:54.919
What the hell have we walked into?

04:55.087 --> 04:57.713
An outbreak with no cure.
A cult with no leader.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.841
Not to mention an episode
of Family Feud, sister-wives edition.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.844
I offer Amy carte blanche,
what does she want? Immortality.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.973
-She's not stupid.
-Worse. She's smart and certifiable.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.600
You're not actually
gonna make her immortal?

05:09.768 --> 05:13.813
It's impossible. I've tried replicating the
science. Every time my simulations failed.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.065
Last thing the world needs
is a forever Amy.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.693
-We'll get what we came for regardless.
-Follow her.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.862
See if there's anything you can leverage.
Any kind of weakness.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.991
-I'm gonna do some digging of my own.
-Julia.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.702
-Be careful.
-You too.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.878
I've looked everywhere.
Mother's not here.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.049
You're angry. I can understand that.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.927
Can you, Anne?
Because I've been searching all night...

05:45.095 --> 05:48.514
...and all I've got to show for it
is bags under my eyes.

05:49.808 --> 05:53.060
What if Mother is lost or destroyed?

05:53.228 --> 05:55.229
Then I'd say our deal is void.

05:56.648 --> 05:57.690
Julia.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.359
Could you please give us a minute,
Anne?

06:14.958 --> 06:16.292
You're done, Peter.

06:16.460 --> 06:17.877
No reward, nothing.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.587
We're not finished searching yet.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.088
Do you even have a plan?

06:21.256 --> 06:24.216
Or are you going to comb
the entire abbey one room at a time?

06:24.384 --> 06:27.094
I will find Mother. You have my word.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.304
The word of a traitor?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.389
I'm a traitor?

06:30.557 --> 06:33.392
You're a member of the Ilaria board.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.019
Once a hypocrite....

06:35.979 --> 06:39.231
You sold me out to the highest bidder.

06:39.399 --> 06:43.235
Betrayed me to that monster
who slit my mother's throat.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.572
Now I'm on the inside
trying to change their tactics.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.327
How could I have been so wrong?

06:52.162 --> 06:54.038
I threw away my marriage for you.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.542
Deny all you want.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.092
I loved you, Julia.

07:07.427 --> 07:12.765
And I thought you were a good man
until I realized there's nothing inside.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.061
You're hollow, Peter.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.866
Words have meaning, Dr. Walker.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.536
They carry weight.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.581
Amy told me you were delusional,
not to trust anything you say.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.086
Amy will say anything
to get what she wants.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.923
Let me guess,
she told you she has Mother?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.343
My daughter is a liar.

07:50.387 --> 07:53.472
Only three people
were charged with Mother's care.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.225
Michael, myself....

07:56.393 --> 07:57.726
Who's the third?

07:59.062 --> 08:02.022
My son, Landry.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.150
Where's Mother, Landry?

08:05.527 --> 08:08.612
I know you've hidden her.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.949
You need to tell me where she is.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.247
Show me a sign.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.374
Anything.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.549
I can feel you staring at me.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.342
Like when we were kids, remember?

08:30.510 --> 08:32.970
Trying to get a peek up my dress?

08:34.347 --> 08:37.641
This is no time for games.

08:37.809 --> 08:39.727
I need your help.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.687
Tell me.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.607
Where's Mother, Landry?

08:48.778 --> 08:51.530
Just blink once if you understand.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.204
Wake up!

08:58.705 --> 09:00.706
Wake up! You need to wake up!

09:01.249 --> 09:03.209
You useless piece of shit.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.718
Disgusting.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.596
I hope you've had time
to reflect on your careless actions.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.848
I did everything that you asked me to.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.226
-You promised to give me my child.
-You failed.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.645
Look at him. He can't even talk.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.147
And I need to talk to him.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.566
I can't treat
unless I can diagnose what's wrong.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.027
And I can't do that
unless I have an EEG, or scan.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.988
You're boring me. Just fix him.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.865
It doesn't work like that.

09:35.659 --> 09:39.328
Then I see no reason
for keeping you or your child alive.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.830
You need us.
We're your only link to immortality.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.791
Not anymore.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.961
I happen to find the new immortal
much more interesting.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.170
What new immortal?

09:48.755 --> 09:53.634
Perhaps you know her. Julia Walker.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.973
Just fix him.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.136
Amy. Amy.

10:42.434 --> 10:45.811
Landry was always willing
to go beyond what was required.

10:46.771 --> 10:47.813
Let me go.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.149
He was responsible
for Michael's protection.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.276
His person as well as his research.

10:52.819 --> 10:53.861
Landry, no.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.821
He knew Mother was essential.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.032
I'm sure he has her in a safe place.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.913
Landry!

11:07.709 --> 11:09.084
What are you doing?

11:09.252 --> 11:10.961
Landry.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.507
Hello, Sarah.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.186
Mother!

12:16.820 --> 12:19.238
Damn you, Landry.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.950
I know it's here somewhere.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.518
Bad practice, sneaking up on people.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.395
You followed me first.

12:51.563 --> 12:54.022
Those who give
must also be willing to take.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.817
And those who make promises
must also be able to deliver.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.944
Understand?

13:00.822 --> 13:03.157
Make me understand.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.618
I only take orders from Dr. Walker.

13:06.786 --> 13:11.498
Shame to waste so much aggression
on someone who can't even feel it.

13:11.666 --> 13:14.751
Do not talk about her that way.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.962
You really care about her.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.755
I bet you cared about all of them.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.258
Each in their different way.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.635
You know who I don't care about?

13:24.220 --> 13:26.013
You.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.307
Unless you've got the Mother root.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.144
The Abbey is an extension of my being.

13:32.312 --> 13:36.190
All I need to do is look deep enough
and I'll find her.

13:40.195 --> 13:42.154
You lied to us.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.532
Do you want me to find Mother or not?

13:45.700 --> 13:47.951
Be a good boy, let me go look.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.537
Wherever you go, I go.

13:50.705 --> 13:51.914
Like a shadow.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.265
For a moment, I thought you were him.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.271
The way the light would catch his hair.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.235
But then I remembered...

14:22.111 --> 14:23.654
...Michael is gone.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.281
Maybe he has the right idea.

14:26.449 --> 14:30.786
Whatever prevents Michael from being
here, I assure you it's not to be envied.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.498
Anything would be better than this.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.375
I came here to lead an investigation.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.753
And now I'm persona non grata
on my own team.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.965
Change is inevitable.

14:43.132 --> 14:47.678
What I don't understand is why you allow
Dr. Walker to speak to you that way.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.346
We all say things we don't mean.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.141
We always say what we mean
at the time we say it.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.812
Do you think she has a right
to judge you?

14:56.980 --> 14:59.523
I broke up her marriage to my brother.

14:59.691 --> 15:02.693
Or was the affair
merely a result of his failings?

15:02.860 --> 15:05.195
No, I drove them apart.

15:05.363 --> 15:06.947
I don't deserve their forgiveness.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.324
You don't need their forgiveness.

15:09.492 --> 15:12.202
You're a brilliant doctor. A great man.

15:13.204 --> 15:16.039
You have no idea what kind of man I am.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.334
Hell, I'm not even sure
myself sometimes.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.461
I see you, Peter.

15:22.672 --> 15:25.340
I see what your path could be.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.759
If only you could see it for yourself.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.470
You don't know
how the outside world works.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.556
Perhaps not.

15:33.308 --> 15:36.226
But I know human nature.

15:36.394 --> 15:40.814
Those who are meant to lead
are never satisfied to follow.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.362
So, what's so important
about this root?

15:47.905 --> 15:49.364
You're missing the point.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.825
Mother is a means to an end.

15:51.993 --> 15:55.621
It's not so much what Mother is
as why.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.040
So tell me.

16:00.126 --> 16:03.378
The truth can be unforgiving.
Are you certain?

16:03.546 --> 16:05.088
Don't play games with me, Anne.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.090
It's not a game.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.092
It's very dangerous.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.596
For both of us.

16:17.769 --> 16:22.773
I've only got 72 hours
until Ilaria releases the new Narvik-C.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.734
What could Ilaria
possibly have to gain?

16:25.902 --> 16:28.070
They're not looking to profit
in the short term.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.238
It's about restoring balance
for the future.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.407
-The board believes--
-Do you hear yourself?

16:32.575 --> 16:35.077
I'm doing everything in my power
to change this, Sarah.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.747
Have you even considered the
implications of worldwide sterilization?

16:38.915 --> 16:41.083
Infertility is a way
to temporarily depopulate.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.294
-Just until resources are replenished.
-You think you know better.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.713
But you don't have the right
to make that choice.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.049
We're going to be on this planet
for centuries.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.218
We have a responsibility
to do something.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.011
You sound just like one of them.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.722
-One of us.
-No, I'm not one of anything.

17:01.729 --> 17:05.399
When Narvik is released
there will be no stopping it this time.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.360
Within a few weeks
the CDC as you know it won't exist.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.904
Bodies will pile up in every major city.

17:11.072 --> 17:13.281
You will lose everyone, Sarah.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.574
Friends, family.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.452
You've seen Narvik up close.

17:17.620 --> 17:21.206
I know you care about stopping
this outbreak more than anything.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.545
Actually,
there's something I care about more.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.394
Is Dr. Kyle gonna be okay?

17:44.021 --> 17:46.106
I hope so, Soren.

17:46.274 --> 17:48.233
Are we getting closer
to the red sap tree?

17:48.401 --> 17:50.652
I think so.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.362
I've only went a few times.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.823
Just get us there.
I'll take care of Dr. Kyle.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.491
All right.

17:58.119 --> 17:59.953
What's that smell?

18:00.121 --> 18:01.621
You smell that, Sommer?

18:03.082 --> 18:06.126
-I don't smell anything.
-Stinks real bad.

18:06.294 --> 18:07.335
Like you!

18:08.254 --> 18:11.173
-What did you say?
-Stinky Sommer rolls in shit.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.301
-Stinky Sommer rolls in shit.
-I don't stink.

18:14.469 --> 18:17.095
-Stinky Sommer rolls in shit.
-Shut up.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.722
Stinky Sommer rolls in shit.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.307
-Shit.
-Just shut up.

18:20.475 --> 18:24.102
-Shit.
-Shut up. Shut up. No. Shut up.

18:24.312 --> 18:27.439
No. No. No.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.400
Stop it. No.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.155
I'm so sorry, Sarah. Are you okay?

18:35.323 --> 18:37.574
I can't start thinking
about what happened to me.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.659
It won't do him any good.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.745
Now do you see?

18:41.913 --> 18:42.954
I have to get him back.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.832
He'll be frozen like that. Forever.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.502
I'm his mother, Julia.
I'll find a way for him to grow.

18:48.669 --> 18:53.423
I hope you do. What about the father.
Does he know about all of this?

18:54.342 --> 18:55.550
Yeah. Alan knows.

18:59.514 --> 19:01.097
Alan?

19:01.349 --> 19:02.766
Yeah.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.685
Where is he now?

19:05.853 --> 19:08.355
He's out there looking for the cure.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.482
-Same old Alan.
-Yeah.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.277
-What?
-Look. Right there.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.948
Oh, my God, it's leaking.
Where's the crack? I don't see it.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.867
It's hard to tell.
This equipment is ancient.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.286
Oh, my God, he's gonna die.

19:23.454 --> 19:26.164
Not if we can figure out a way
to give Amy what she wants.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.124
With what? Look at where we are.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.919
-The lab's outdated, but we'll make do.
-It's impossible.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.880
-Then who better the us to figure it out?
-Us?

19:34.048 --> 19:36.091
We're both desperate
and running out of time.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.468
You want your baby and I want Mother.

19:38.636 --> 19:42.264
Either we can fail alone or we can both
get what we want by working together.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.781
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.450
Five whole minutes, use them well.

20:02.702 --> 20:06.454
We got one hour of daylight left, so we'll
be moving the search to higher ground.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.207
That'll give us a chance
at picking up a sat signal.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.377
Dr. Kyle, you hungry?

20:12.545 --> 20:13.628
The flavor's oatmeal.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.758
Come on, eat some. It's good.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.636
Eat it. Come on, Stinky Sommer. Eat it.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.054
Don't call me that.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.015
Stinky Sommer rolls in shit.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.933
Stinky Sommer rolls in shit.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.519
You smell that? Smells like shit.

20:29.687 --> 20:32.022
Stinky Sommer rolls in shit.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.691
Eats his way out bit by bit.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.568
Stinky Sommer rolls in shit.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.945
Stinky Sommer rolls in shit.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.156
Eats his way out bit by bit.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.491
Stinky Sommer rolls in shit.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.243
-Stinky--
-No. No. No, don't do it.

20:45.411 --> 20:48.622
-Kyle. Kyle. Kyle. Kyle.
-No.

20:51.918 --> 20:57.005
Kyle. Kyle, what you're seeing isn't real,
all right?

20:57.173 --> 20:58.465
Can you hear me?

21:01.177 --> 21:02.260
Quick, grab him.

21:03.054 --> 21:04.512
Take it easy, doc.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.014
It's all right, Soren.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.853
We need to get to that high ground.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.649
Where are you taking me, Anne?

21:15.816 --> 21:18.109
Just a little farther.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.324
Jesus.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.326
Do you need a moment?

21:26.869 --> 21:28.286
No.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.424
The boneyard out in the woods.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.720
All those skulls without teeth.

21:45.888 --> 21:49.265
The vessel must be prepared
to receive the offering.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.226
Vessel?

21:51.811 --> 21:55.730
-You're talking about human beings?
-All will become clear, Peter.

21:56.273 --> 22:02.946
But in order to hear the truth,
you first must speak your own truth.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.618
Anne?

22:08.786 --> 22:10.245
Anne.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.253
Found something.

22:19.213 --> 22:20.380
Take a guess.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.298
I'm not playing games.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.093
Come on.

22:27.138 --> 22:30.056
Aren't you even a little curious?

22:43.696 --> 22:45.572
You're hurting me.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.804
You try that again
and I will slice your pretty little throat.

23:17.146 --> 23:20.565
Okay. On to the next.

23:23.694 --> 23:24.903
We got signal!

23:25.071 --> 23:26.905
We got comm!

23:29.408 --> 23:30.700
Manitou.

23:30.868 --> 23:33.203
Manitou, this is Humphries.

23:33.370 --> 23:36.873
Manitou, switch and answer 3-1, over.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.169
Manitou, this is Humphries.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.379
Switch and answer 3-1, over.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.507
Mayday!
This is Coast Guard cutter Manitou.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.635
We are overrun!
Repeat, we are overrun!

23:48.803 --> 23:50.720
Manitou, this is Winger.
I need a sitrep.

23:50.888 --> 23:53.473
-I need a sitrep.
-Everyone's sick.

23:53.641 --> 23:54.933
We can't--

23:55.101 --> 23:56.810
We can't hold them.

23:56.977 --> 23:59.938
They're gonna kill us all! No!

24:07.446 --> 24:09.572
Manitou, this is Winger.

24:10.658 --> 24:11.908
Manitou? Do you copy?

24:13.077 --> 24:16.329
We all sound the same under water.

24:16.956 --> 24:20.917
We all sound the same under water.

24:21.085 --> 24:23.211
We all sound the same--

24:27.550 --> 24:30.343
-How is this disease spreading so fast?
-Any number of ways.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.554
Island-hopping, my cutter....
Is it airborne?

24:32.721 --> 24:34.139
-Screw this!
-And the Manitou?

24:34.306 --> 24:36.474
-We gotta get to the ship.
-Stow it, lieutenant.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.893
We were given orders
to evac the CDC...

24:39.061 --> 24:41.729
...not follow some one-eyed kid
to a magic tree.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.482
That kid might be the key
to saving all our lives.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.277
And there is no ship.

24:47.444 --> 24:50.071
Not anymore. They're all dead.

24:50.823 --> 24:55.618
Dr. Farragut is right.
We need to regroup and find that tree.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.172
Hey. Hey, Soren.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.007
Hey.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.301
You still got that PowerBar?

25:12.344 --> 25:13.803
Yeah.

25:22.897 --> 25:24.564
Oh, yeah.

25:28.319 --> 25:30.236
That's delicious.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.447
But now I'm thirsty.

25:32.615 --> 25:33.907
Can you bring me my pack?

25:35.284 --> 25:36.951
I better ask Commander Winger first.

25:37.119 --> 25:39.996
She's real busy. Too busy for us.

25:41.707 --> 25:43.416
Come on, it's just a drink of water.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.432
Hey, but maybe you're getting better
like I did.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.267
You sound like the old Dr. Kyle.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.228
-Do I?
-Yeah.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.772
So if the old Dr. Kyle...

26:05.940 --> 26:09.692
...asked for just one of his hands free
so he could drink his own water...?

26:17.576 --> 26:18.952
Okay.

26:20.454 --> 26:21.788
Yeah.

26:22.289 --> 26:23.748
There you go.

26:30.631 --> 26:34.092
Help! Help, please! Help me!

26:34.260 --> 26:37.512
Get him! Go, go, go!

26:38.013 --> 26:39.806
Help, please!

27:18.595 --> 27:20.930
The immortality gene is the same
in all of us.

27:21.098 --> 27:24.976
So why did the CSF transfer work
from me to you, and not you to Landry?

27:25.144 --> 27:28.146
I thought my spinal fluid was different
from yours, but it's not.

27:28.314 --> 27:32.025
What if it wasn't the difference in the cells
but the timing of the transfer?

27:32.192 --> 27:33.776
There's a study out of Berkeley...

27:33.944 --> 27:36.779
...linking embryonic cells
to breakthroughs in regeneration.

27:36.947 --> 27:39.407
Right, how stem cells specialize
over time...

27:39.575 --> 27:41.492
...to create various tissues in the body.

27:41.660 --> 27:45.038
When I got your fluid, you had
only been an immortal for a few days.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.248
Your cells had yet to specify
the RNA chains.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.584
And once immortal DNA is transcribed
into RNA--

27:49.752 --> 27:51.878
-Those mature cells are nontransferable.
-Yes.

27:52.046 --> 27:54.714
That's why it failed.
You weren't a brand-new immortal.

27:54.882 --> 27:57.467
If we could figure out
how to reverse the specificity--

27:57.634 --> 27:59.761
We could give Amy immortality.

28:08.562 --> 28:11.022
You know, you really are being wasted
at the CDC.

28:12.274 --> 28:15.276
You should be running your own lab.
Unlimited funding.

28:15.444 --> 28:18.154
Cutting-edge equipment. Gloves off.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.865
-Ilaria?
-Why not?

28:21.033 --> 28:23.493
There's not enough funding
in the world.

28:39.927 --> 28:41.386
Anne?

28:42.679 --> 28:44.555
What the hell is this?

28:45.182 --> 28:48.059
I'm going to ask you a question, Peter.

28:48.227 --> 28:51.145
It's important that you answer honestly.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.481
No more lies.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.233
Do we have to do this in the dark?

28:55.401 --> 28:58.027
There can be no distractions.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.116
Now, tell me...

29:03.283 --> 29:05.743
...what do you want?

29:06.370 --> 29:08.413
I want you to turn on the light, Anne.

29:08.580 --> 29:13.084
What do you want?

29:17.548 --> 29:19.966
Look, you'll have to give me
a little more than that.

29:20.134 --> 29:21.634
One word.

29:21.802 --> 29:25.805
The one thing you want above all else.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.934
I want to be happy.

29:30.519 --> 29:31.978
I want to be fulfilled.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.315
I don't know, Anne.
I want a goddamn golden toilet.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.025
You're lying.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.528
If you're not ready to face your truth....

29:40.696 --> 29:42.488
No, no.

29:44.408 --> 29:46.200
No, I'm ready.

29:47.744 --> 29:48.786
Okay.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.706
I want...

29:55.210 --> 29:57.128
...respect.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.630
I want you to think, Peter.

29:59.798 --> 30:03.759
When was the time
you felt the most respected?

30:05.888 --> 30:07.388
I don't know.

30:08.724 --> 30:11.058
When I was made team leader
at the CDC.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.853
You're lying again.
That's someone else's work.

30:14.021 --> 30:16.898
-What is your truth?
-I don't know.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.316
I'm not lying.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.443
-I'm not lying to you.
-Worse.

30:20.611 --> 30:22.737
You're lying to yourself. Think.

30:22.905 --> 30:26.032
When did you feel the most respected?

30:26.658 --> 30:29.076
I told you, when I....

30:29.244 --> 30:32.788
Remember a time
when you had what you wanted.

30:32.956 --> 30:36.918
When you felt complete.
When you weren't hiding or lying.

30:37.085 --> 30:39.170
When you were yourself.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.758
-I can't.
-You can.

30:43.926 --> 30:47.470
Stop hiding. Accept your truth.

30:51.475 --> 30:53.601
When I was sick...

30:54.603 --> 30:56.646
...with Narvik...

30:58.690 --> 31:00.816
...they all came to me.

31:01.985 --> 31:05.071
I didn't have to say a word.

31:05.239 --> 31:07.823
And they all listened to me.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.113
Where are we going?

31:48.073 --> 31:50.783
One of Landry's old hiding spots.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.786
We use to play here
when we were children.

31:54.371 --> 31:56.414
That's hard to imagine.

31:56.582 --> 31:59.000
What? That we were allowed
to play up here?

31:59.167 --> 32:01.043
No. That you were ever a little kid.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.643
What's taking Balleseros so long?

32:59.186 --> 33:02.021
Don't worry. He may get sidetracked,
but he'll come through.

33:02.189 --> 33:05.232
It's not like we have anything
to give to Amy anyway.

33:06.610 --> 33:09.528
We're running out of time,
and she's gonna kill my son.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.238
Let me talk to her. Alone.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.449
-No. No.
-You're too emotionally invested.

33:13.617 --> 33:16.369
You wanted to do this together,
so I'm coming with you.

33:22.626 --> 33:24.293
Amy will see you now.

33:24.461 --> 33:26.170
And who are you?

33:27.339 --> 33:29.590
That's the bitch that stabbed me.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.219
There they are!

33:33.845 --> 33:35.304
Stand down. Stand down!

33:35.472 --> 33:38.057
Copy that. Stand down.
Secure your weapons.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.184
Dr. Sommer! Let the boy go.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.311
Why do you hate me? Why?

33:42.479 --> 33:44.689
I don't hate you. I don't.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.565
Please.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.651
-Let me try to talk to him.
-Too risky.

33:48.819 --> 33:52.238
-If you go in there, we'll lose both.
-I won't let you hurt me anymore.

33:52.406 --> 33:54.740
-I won't let you hurt anyone!
-Please, don't.

33:55.200 --> 34:00.121
At some point you must decide
what kind of man you want to be.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.542
One who fears.

34:04.710 --> 34:07.920
Or one who inspires fear.

34:13.593 --> 34:15.970
Which man are you, Peter?

34:21.101 --> 34:22.935
Are you ready to lead?

34:27.149 --> 34:30.067
Now I can finally share
my truth with you.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.166
What is this?

34:45.959 --> 34:49.211
Some kind of experiment?

34:52.799 --> 34:55.050
I was an experiment...

34:55.218 --> 34:59.013
...as were Amy and Agnes
and all those who came before us.

34:59.431 --> 35:02.892
I was one in a long line of failures.

35:05.270 --> 35:08.105
It was Michael's dream to breed
an immortal companion.

35:08.565 --> 35:11.859
What you see are those
who refused his call.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.613
They were brought here...

35:15.781 --> 35:17.615
...stripped of all non-essentials....

35:21.369 --> 35:22.912
Like teeth?

35:23.079 --> 35:24.580
Unnecessary.

35:24.748 --> 35:27.208
We didn't want them to chew
their feeding tubes.

35:28.293 --> 35:31.045
They became pure vessels.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.841
And once they bore Michael a child...

35:36.009 --> 35:37.635
...he would end their path.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.348
Mother.

35:42.766 --> 35:44.308
Michael.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.268
The Fellowship.

35:47.229 --> 35:49.271
It's not about propagating family.

35:49.439 --> 35:52.274
It's about control. Respect.

35:54.027 --> 35:58.197
True leaders will make you believe
that their ideas are your own.

35:58.365 --> 35:59.615
That their way...

36:00.200 --> 36:02.660
...is the only way.

36:03.453 --> 36:05.538
It may not feel like it...

36:06.081 --> 36:07.832
...but you always have choices.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.209
When we were young...

36:10.377 --> 36:12.837
...we believed everything
everybody told us...

36:13.004 --> 36:14.547
...even those who hurt us.

36:16.383 --> 36:19.927
But someone hurt them too.

36:20.929 --> 36:24.139
And it's not true
that you have to hurt others first...

36:24.307 --> 36:26.642
-...to survive.
-Please.

36:26.810 --> 36:29.103
-There is another way.
-There is no other way.

36:32.107 --> 36:34.900
Why can't I make them like me?

36:35.068 --> 36:36.193
Why?

36:37.737 --> 36:39.822
They're afraid...

36:39.990 --> 36:42.575
...that you will discover the truth:

36:43.493 --> 36:46.120
That no matter what they've done...

36:46.288 --> 36:48.831
...you still decide what happens next.

36:49.457 --> 36:52.418
-Don't make the mistake I did.
-Please.

36:52.586 --> 36:54.920
Don't hold on to the past...

36:56.256 --> 36:58.507
...become the thing you hate.

37:00.510 --> 37:03.470
Show them they have no power.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.389
Right?

37:05.557 --> 37:06.682
Walk away.

37:09.811 --> 37:12.146
How do I know they won't follow me?

37:13.148 --> 37:14.523
You don't.

37:22.282 --> 37:23.741
Please.

37:26.870 --> 37:28.495
Please.

37:36.379 --> 37:37.421
There it is.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.423
The tree.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.766
Only you can decide your path.

37:49.309 --> 37:50.559
Leader?

37:50.727 --> 37:52.478
Or follower?

37:55.649 --> 37:57.942
Leaders don't have to say a word...

37:58.109 --> 37:59.818
...and everyone listens.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.988
Will you lead, Peter?

38:03.156 --> 38:05.574
Will you choose who lives?

39:28.324 --> 39:34.246
I'm not seeing
any happy, smiling faces.

39:35.749 --> 39:38.000
I kept up my end of the bargain.

39:38.168 --> 39:40.335
And we have a plan to keep up ours.

39:40.503 --> 39:43.714
-A promising new theory.
-I don't care about your theories.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.133
-You know what I want.
-Doesn't happen overnight.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.052
We need more time.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.680
-Sarah.
-And yet it worked for the two of you.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.850
-I'm not stupid.
-Evidence to the contrary.

39:56.978 --> 39:58.479
I guess you won't need this.

39:58.646 --> 40:00.689
-No! Wait! Stop!
-Say goodbye to your son!

40:00.857 --> 40:03.650
Wait! You don't want to do that.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.903
-And why not?
-Because that baby is the key...

40:06.071 --> 40:07.738
...to giving you immortality.

40:08.448 --> 40:09.490
What?

40:09.657 --> 40:11.825
The child's DNA
has been frozen in time.

40:11.993 --> 40:14.453
Genes normally pass genetic traits
onto offspring...

40:14.621 --> 40:16.997
...but in this case,
we can engineer the reverse.

40:17.165 --> 40:18.749
Julia, what are you talking about?

40:18.917 --> 40:20.918
How does it work?
Another spinal thing?

40:21.086 --> 40:22.419
No.

40:22.962 --> 40:25.631
We'll have to implant the baby
into your uterus.

40:25.799 --> 40:28.258
No. No! No! No, you can't!

40:28.718 --> 40:30.552
No, Julia, you liar!

40:30.720 --> 40:32.971
No, you can't!
That's my baby! You liar!

40:33.139 --> 40:36.141
-I'm going to be a mother?
-No! No!

40:36.309 --> 40:38.685
No! Julia.... What are you doing?

40:38.853 --> 40:40.395
No! No, you can't!

40:40.563 --> 40:41.855
No! No!
