WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:03.629
You're only going to take

00:01.710 --> 00:03.629
off a quarter-inch on the sides,

00:03.671 --> 00:05.422
leave the top

00:03.671 --> 00:05.422
and just clean up the back.

00:05.464 --> 00:07.925
LOIS:

00:05.464 --> 00:07.925
Reese, I've done this

00:05.464 --> 00:07.925
a million times.

00:07.967 --> 00:10.051
(grunts)

00:10.093 --> 00:11.971
Mom, look.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.971
I just ripped

00:12.011 --> 00:13.096
my brand-new shirt

00:13.138 --> 00:14.640
sneaking into the reservoir--

00:14.682 --> 00:17.058
that place you clearly

00:14.682 --> 00:17.058
ordered me never to go.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.060
I don't know why

00:17.100 --> 00:19.060
I do these things

00:19.102 --> 00:20.688
that are so

00:19.102 --> 00:20.688
infuriating to you,

00:20.729 --> 00:23.482
but the funny thing is,

00:20.729 --> 00:23.482
I don't even care.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.526
Damn it, Dewey,

00:23.524 --> 00:25.526
go to your room!

00:26.944 --> 00:28.570
Let's get this

00:26.944 --> 00:28.570
over with!

00:28.612 --> 00:32.073
No, Mom! Count to ten!

00:28.612 --> 00:32.073
Count to ten!

00:32.115 --> 00:35.744
♪ Life is unfair. ♪

00:37.788 --> 00:39.080
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.708
I'll tell you

00:39.122 --> 00:40.708
what I'm thankful for.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.669
I finally made friends

00:40.749 --> 00:43.669
with some normal kids at school.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.086
Normal kids.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.672
We've been hanging out here

00:45.128 --> 00:46.672
all afternoon,

00:46.714 --> 00:48.507
and nobody's mentioned

00:46.714 --> 00:48.507
grass allergies

00:48.549 --> 00:49.717
or pollen count.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.344
Malcolm, I never noticed

00:49.758 --> 00:52.344
what nice eyes you have.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.095
Really?

00:52.386 --> 00:54.095
Kirsten Stuart.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.306
I think she likes me,

00:54.137 --> 00:56.306
but I can never be sure.

00:56.348 --> 00:57.975
Yeah, I guess

00:56.348 --> 00:57.975
I was distracted

00:58.017 --> 01:00.101
by your freakishly large head.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.980
Mostly 'cause of stuff

01:00.143 --> 01:02.980
like that.

01:03.022 --> 01:04.147
Hey, guys, I've got to go.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.316
Hey, party at my house,

01:04.189 --> 01:06.316
Thanksgiving.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.569
Three cases of beer. No one's

01:06.358 --> 01:08.569
leaving till their gone.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.029
Your parents are out of town?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.112
No.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.949
Oh, sweet. Yeah, of course.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.245
Cute butt.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.498
Why'd you have

01:19.162 --> 01:21.498
to spoil it?

01:21.540 --> 01:23.375
I know what she's trying to do.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.586
She's trying to confuse me,

01:23.417 --> 01:25.586
throw me off balance.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.755
But you know what?

01:25.627 --> 01:27.755
It's not going...

01:34.053 --> 01:35.220
Reese!

01:35.262 --> 01:36.847
Grab an apron.

01:36.889 --> 01:39.140
It's 6:30 in the morning.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.308
Yes, I know.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.936
That means

01:40.350 --> 01:41.936
I have exactly 12 hours left

01:41.977 --> 01:44.145
to create the most

01:41.977 --> 01:44.145
fantastic Thanksgiving feast

01:44.187 --> 01:46.065
in the history

01:44.187 --> 01:46.065
of Thanksgiving feasts.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.148
What's with the sheets?

01:47.190 --> 01:48.442
I can't cook with

01:47.190 --> 01:48.442
distractions.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.777
I don't think that's...

01:49.818 --> 01:51.152
Dad, remember

01:49.818 --> 01:51.152
the chocolate soufflé

01:51.194 --> 01:52.863
I made for Thanksgiving

01:51.194 --> 01:52.863
two years ago?

01:52.905 --> 01:54.155
Oh, yeah. That was...

01:54.197 --> 01:55.783
Rat puke compared to

01:54.197 --> 01:55.783
what I have planned!

01:55.824 --> 01:57.952
The crepes I made

01:55.824 --> 01:57.952
last Thanksgiving?

01:57.993 --> 01:59.160
Ooh, they were...

01:59.202 --> 02:01.663
Crap next to what

01:59.202 --> 02:01.663
we're having tonight!

02:01.705 --> 02:03.665
Don't think of

02:01.705 --> 02:03.665
this as a meal.

02:03.707 --> 02:06.167
This is going to be like

02:03.707 --> 02:06.167
eating the  Mona Lisa.

02:06.209 --> 02:09.379
Reese, I hardly think

02:06.209 --> 02:09.379
you can comp...

02:10.213 --> 02:11.757
Oh, my God.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.174
What do you need?

02:13.216 --> 02:14.635
Your mindless,

02:13.216 --> 02:14.635
robot-like obedience

02:14.676 --> 02:16.678
to every demand I make--

02:14.676 --> 02:16.678
no matter how small.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.180
Plus, we get to eat anything

02:16.720 --> 02:19.180
that falls on the floor.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.682
Ooh!

02:20.724 --> 02:23.060
I'm going over to Dylan's.

02:20.724 --> 02:23.060
I'll be back by dinner.

02:23.102 --> 02:24.812
Dylan-- whom I've never met

02:23.102 --> 02:24.812
because you're afraid

02:24.853 --> 02:27.064
to have me find out what a

02:24.853 --> 02:27.064
bad choice he is as a friend?

02:27.106 --> 02:29.357
He's okay, Mom. There's going to

02:27.106 --> 02:29.357
be other kids from school there.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.359
It's sort of like a party.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.359
I really want to go.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.029
Well, your family is having

02:31.401 --> 02:34.029
sort of like a party, too.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.197
It's called Thanksgiving.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.197
Now, it's true we're

02:36.239 --> 02:38.283
not a bunch of friends

02:36.239 --> 02:38.283
you just met last week.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.201
We're only the people

02:38.325 --> 02:40.201
who have sacrificed our lives

02:40.243 --> 02:41.703
for years

02:40.243 --> 02:41.703
so that you could have a home.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.831
I'll only be gone

02:41.745 --> 02:43.831
a couple hours, okay?

02:43.872 --> 02:46.125
You mean like the couple

02:43.872 --> 02:46.125
of hours you were jammed

02:46.166 --> 02:49.210
half-in and half-out of me

02:46.166 --> 02:49.210
when you were being born?

02:49.252 --> 02:51.296
Half an hour?

02:49.252 --> 02:51.296
I just don't understand

02:51.338 --> 02:53.799
what is so horrible

02:51.338 --> 02:53.799
about our family.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.216
Yes, she does.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.385
I mean, why on earth

02:55.258 --> 02:57.385
would you prefer

02:57.427 --> 02:58.846
to be somewhere else

02:58.887 --> 03:00.055
for Thanksgiving?

03:00.097 --> 03:01.389
I love her!

03:01.431 --> 03:04.101
And if the two of you

03:01.431 --> 03:04.101
are too dead inside

03:04.143 --> 03:07.146
to understand what that means,

03:04.143 --> 03:07.146
then I just pity you.

03:08.897 --> 03:13.234
(voice breaking):

03:08.897 --> 03:13.234
No, no, Dad, I understand.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.697
When you get a new toothbrush

03:13.276 --> 03:16.697
and you want to break it in...

03:22.285 --> 03:24.329
Go ahead and say it, Lois.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.875
Well, happy Thanksgiving.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.251
I'll just go over there

03:27.916 --> 03:30.251
and tell them I'm not coming.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.252
Do whatever you want.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.838
Even though your

03:31.294 --> 03:32.838
brother has

03:32.880 --> 03:35.132
traveled hundreds

03:32.880 --> 03:35.132
of miles with her.

03:35.174 --> 03:37.258
Piama.

03:35.174 --> 03:37.258
I know her name.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.844
Your family is going to be here,

03:38.886 --> 03:41.262
and we are going

03:38.886 --> 03:41.262
to have a lovely Thanksgiving.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.057
FRANCIS:

03:41.304 --> 03:43.057
I will not keep

03:41.304 --> 03:43.057
my voice down!

03:43.098 --> 03:44.683
What, you think they won't know

03:43.098 --> 03:44.683
in, like, five minutes

03:44.725 --> 03:46.267
that we're getting a divorce?!

03:46.309 --> 03:48.269
Sorry, we're having

03:46.309 --> 03:48.269
some problems.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.437
Having some problems?

03:49.479 --> 03:51.272
Is that what you

03:49.479 --> 03:51.272
call finding out

03:51.314 --> 03:53.859
that all the love that

03:51.314 --> 03:53.859
we shared was a lie?!

03:53.901 --> 03:55.110
Hi, Mom.

03:57.362 --> 04:00.281
Malcolm, you better go

03:57.362 --> 04:00.281
get your father.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.283
Malcolm!

04:03.410 --> 04:04.870
This party's pretty cool.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.163
And, you know,

04:06.205 --> 04:07.497
I think I've figured

04:06.205 --> 04:07.497
Kirsten out.

04:07.539 --> 04:10.209
It's more of a friend-brother

04:07.539 --> 04:10.209
kind of thing.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.753
It's not really sexual.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.297
Then again...

04:16.339 --> 04:17.716
Beer man.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.510
My stepdad drinks so much,

04:17.758 --> 04:20.510
he never counts it.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.179
Malcolm?

04:22.221 --> 04:23.304
Yeah, sure.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.307
Yeah, sure.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.979
Hey, guys, how's it going?

04:31.021 --> 04:33.899
I need something to warm up

04:31.021 --> 04:33.899
that Arctic wind

04:33.941 --> 04:35.358
she's blowing up there.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.236
No offense to your mother.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.319
I love her very much.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.114
It's cool, Art.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.364
All right. You kids have fun.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.326
Somebody drop a beer?

04:45.368 --> 04:46.327
(laughter)

04:46.369 --> 04:47.328
Sorry.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.496
My parents are

04:47.370 --> 04:48.496
a little less casual

04:48.538 --> 04:49.957
about the whole beer thing.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.921
I bet you kiss

04:53.460 --> 04:55.921
like a nine-year-old.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.798
What?

04:57.839 --> 04:59.133
What?

04:59.174 --> 05:01.342
Okay, this one I do know

04:59.174 --> 05:01.342
what she was doing.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.928
It was a total come-on.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.180
I'll show her

05:02.970 --> 05:05.180
how a nine-year-old can kiss.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.351
Hey.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.404
FRANCIS:

05:20.028 --> 05:21.404
Don't tell me not to cry!

05:21.446 --> 05:23.282
Maybe my tears

05:21.446 --> 05:23.282
will make an ocean

05:23.323 --> 05:25.366
and you can sail off

05:23.323 --> 05:25.366
on a boat

05:25.408 --> 05:27.286
to a new life without me!

05:27.327 --> 05:29.370
How did this happen?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.370
It's terrible.

05:30.289 --> 05:31.832
What's that look, Hal?

05:31.873 --> 05:33.458
Come on, Lois.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.458
You've been trying

05:33.500 --> 05:35.669
to undercut this relationship

05:33.500 --> 05:35.669
from the start.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.587
And now all of a sudden,

05:35.710 --> 05:37.587
they're getting a divorce

05:37.629 --> 05:39.173
and you had nothing

05:37.629 --> 05:39.173
to do with it?

05:39.214 --> 05:41.842
Please. You really think

05:39.214 --> 05:41.842
I have that much power

05:41.883 --> 05:44.385
to orchestrate people's lives

05:41.883 --> 05:44.385
besides yours?

05:44.427 --> 05:46.305
All I know is that

05:44.427 --> 05:46.305
our son is talking

05:46.345 --> 05:47.388
about ending his marriage--

05:47.430 --> 05:48.974
a marriage which

05:47.430 --> 05:48.974
you never supported.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.976
Hal, that's ridiculous.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.976
Fine, fine.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.894
You want me to go

05:51.018 --> 05:52.894
talk to Francis?

05:52.936 --> 05:54.395
Yes. No!

05:54.437 --> 05:56.982
No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.027
This is some way for you

05:57.024 --> 06:00.027
to try to work out your agenda.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.321
Fine. I will not say

06:00.068 --> 06:02.321
a word to either one of 'em.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.404
Good.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.407
Wait.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.407
You won't say anything,

06:06.449 --> 06:08.327
which means you're just

06:06.449 --> 06:08.327
going to let

06:08.367 --> 06:09.703
this whole thing

06:08.367 --> 06:09.703
fall apart.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.579
Oh, I see your game, Lois.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.581
Hal, what is it

06:11.621 --> 06:13.581
you want me to do?

06:13.623 --> 06:15.209
No, no, you are not dragging me

06:15.250 --> 06:17.418
into your little Machiavellian

06:15.250 --> 06:17.418
schemes, thank you very much.

06:17.460 --> 06:21.256
No, you spun these

06:17.460 --> 06:21.256
tangled webs yourself, Lois.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.633
You get yourself out.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.053
See?

06:26.094 --> 06:27.637
The real balsamic

06:26.094 --> 06:27.637
has a smoother mouth feel.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.430
Good, you're back.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.225
I'm going to start prepping

06:29.472 --> 06:31.225
the herbs de Provence

06:31.266 --> 06:32.433
and sautéing the mushrooms.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.353
I need you to scrub these

06:32.475 --> 06:34.353
pots and pans again.

06:34.393 --> 06:35.312
What?

06:35.354 --> 06:37.314
No, I just finished those.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.815
Dad, look at this.

06:38.857 --> 06:41.442
The stubborn patina

06:38.857 --> 06:41.442
of tuna casserole,

06:41.484 --> 06:43.320
or enchilada loaf,

06:43.362 --> 06:44.863
or whatever in God's name

06:44.905 --> 06:47.490
this greasy spoon churns out

06:44.905 --> 06:47.490
night after soul-killing night.

06:47.532 --> 06:48.658
But not tonight.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.619
Tonight we go

06:48.700 --> 06:51.619
for greatness.

06:51.661 --> 06:52.913
Are you with me, Dad?

06:52.954 --> 06:53.747
No!

06:53.788 --> 06:55.540
This pot is clean enough, Reese.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.334
No one will taste this.

06:57.376 --> 06:58.877
All right, then.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.213
I guess no one will

06:58.919 --> 07:01.213
ever taste this!

07:05.424 --> 07:07.802
Oh, my God.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.308
Dewey, I need you to

07:11.514 --> 07:13.308
do something for me.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.351
No. No more.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.476
I'm sick of this.

07:15.518 --> 07:16.853
If I have to sculpt

07:15.518 --> 07:16.853
another radish

07:16.895 --> 07:18.355
or de-vein another prawn...

07:18.397 --> 07:20.481
Dewey, do you trust me?

07:20.523 --> 07:23.151
No.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.151
Do you fear me?

07:23.193 --> 07:24.652
No. Not in the long run.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.904
Come on, Dewey.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.655
It's just a couple

07:25.946 --> 07:27.655
of things I need

07:27.697 --> 07:29.532
that I couldn't get

07:27.697 --> 07:29.532
Dad to spring for.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.868
So here's $80 from

07:29.574 --> 07:31.868
Dad's wallet.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.495
The items on this

07:31.910 --> 07:34.495
list cost $240,

07:34.537 --> 07:36.664
so you'll have to

07:34.537 --> 07:36.664
turn on the cute.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.292
Can you handle it?

07:38.333 --> 07:40.127
I keep whatever's left over?

07:40.168 --> 07:41.169
Deal.

07:45.424 --> 07:46.507
Mom, can I talk to you?

07:46.549 --> 07:47.508
No, honey, please.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.177
Don't talk to me about this.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.887
No matter what I say,

07:49.219 --> 07:50.887
I'm going to be blamed.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.390
This is for you to work

07:50.929 --> 07:53.390
out with that woman.

07:53.432 --> 07:55.183
Piama.

07:53.432 --> 07:55.183
I know her name.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.726
Could you just listen

07:55.225 --> 07:56.726
to me for a second?

07:56.768 --> 08:00.688
If Piama and I ever were

07:56.768 --> 08:00.688
to get a divorce...

08:00.730 --> 08:02.316
Francis, don't even

08:00.730 --> 08:02.316
talk like that.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.358
I mean it.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.734
You really shouldn't.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.781
What were you going to say?

08:09.823 --> 08:13.534
If we ever were to split up,

08:09.823 --> 08:13.534
could I stay here for a while?

08:13.576 --> 08:16.955
God, Francis, I hate to

08:13.576 --> 08:16.955
even think of such a thing.

08:19.082 --> 08:22.752
But, yes, if such a terrible

08:19.082 --> 08:22.752
thing were to happen,

08:22.794 --> 08:24.921
of course, we'd

08:22.794 --> 08:24.921
be here for you.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.132
Thanks, Mom.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.132
I mean, it was

08:27.174 --> 08:29.550
a stupid fight, I guess,

08:27.174 --> 08:29.550
but it was emblematic

08:29.592 --> 08:31.761
of everything that was bad

08:29.592 --> 08:31.761
with the relationship.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.805
I mean, there are principles.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.805
Principles are important.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.557
I know. I mean, so what

08:33.847 --> 08:36.557
if I'd had a couple beers?

08:36.599 --> 08:41.562
How does it look in front of

08:36.599 --> 08:41.562
the guys if the woman's driving?

08:41.604 --> 08:42.814
What?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.565
She didn't care

08:42.856 --> 08:44.565
about my feelings at all.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.026
What?!

08:46.067 --> 08:47.568
What?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.737
Of all the idiotic,

08:47.610 --> 08:49.737
asinine things

08:49.779 --> 08:51.239
you have ever said, Francis,

08:51.281 --> 08:53.283
this has got to be

08:51.281 --> 08:53.283
one of the worst!

08:53.325 --> 08:54.368
I thought you were on my side.

08:54.409 --> 08:55.952
You don't have a side!

08:55.994 --> 08:58.372
Now, you are going to go and

08:55.994 --> 08:58.372
apologize to that woman.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.581
You are going to tell

08:58.413 --> 09:00.581
her that you are wrong

09:00.623 --> 09:02.250
and she is absolutely

09:00.623 --> 09:02.250
blameless.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.251
You really...?

09:02.292 --> 09:03.251
Go!

09:03.293 --> 09:04.878
Okay, okay.

09:07.797 --> 09:11.426
Yes, he is an idiot.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.388
Okay, Dad, get the bird.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.430
Here.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.683
What, this is

09:16.806 --> 09:18.683
the turkey you got?

09:18.725 --> 09:21.395
It's perfect.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.395
It's really small.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.770
Well, if it were

09:21.436 --> 09:22.770
any bigger,

09:22.812 --> 09:26.607
it wouldn't be able

09:22.812 --> 09:26.607
to fit inside of this!

09:28.651 --> 09:30.611
What? Y-You're going

09:28.651 --> 09:30.611
to put our dinner

09:30.653 --> 09:32.613
inside that monster?

09:32.655 --> 09:34.032
It's a monkfish.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.327
The juices of the monkfish

09:34.074 --> 09:37.327
will baste the turkey.

09:37.369 --> 09:40.121
The flavor from the turkey

09:37.369 --> 09:40.121
will saturate the fish,

09:40.163 --> 09:42.332
both melding into

09:40.163 --> 09:42.332
one fantastic dish.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.625
Reese, this doesn't seem

09:42.374 --> 09:44.625
like a good idea.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.212
I don't know, Dad.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.212
Maybe you're right.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.673
Maybe I have no idea

09:47.254 --> 09:50.673
what I'm talking about.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.636
Oh! Mmm!

09:55.678 --> 09:57.805
You know,

09:55.678 --> 09:57.805
that really shouldn't work.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.640
Listen, my ugly beauty.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.102
Yesterday you

09:59.682 --> 10:02.102
were sucking scum

10:02.143 --> 10:04.104
off the bottom

10:02.143 --> 10:04.104
of the sea.

10:04.145 --> 10:07.148
Tonight you're going to

10:04.145 --> 10:07.148
tango with the gods.

10:07.190 --> 10:12.946
Yes, master, I will be

10:07.190 --> 10:12.946
delicious for you.

10:14.697 --> 10:18.118
Okay, things have definitely

10:14.697 --> 10:18.118
been going better.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.246
I'm absolutely more or less sure

10:18.159 --> 10:21.246
she might like me...

10:21.288 --> 10:22.830
I think.

10:22.872 --> 10:26.376
Looks like you're behind

10:22.872 --> 10:26.376
the proverbial eight ball.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.462
Oh, geez, "proverbial?"

10:28.503 --> 10:30.130
Maybe she didn't notice.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.923
Malcolm, can you

10:30.171 --> 10:31.923
hand me the chalk?

10:31.965 --> 10:35.135
It's right there next

10:31.965 --> 10:35.135
to the proverbial cheese dip.

10:35.176 --> 10:35.969
Okay, okay.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.471
I know it was

10:36.010 --> 10:37.471
a little stilted.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.306
No, I thought it was right

10:37.512 --> 10:39.306
on the proverbial money.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.309
All right.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.309
Sorry. Did I hit

10:39.347 --> 10:42.309
the proverbial sore spot?

10:42.350 --> 10:44.561
You know, you may think

10:42.350 --> 10:44.561
that's flirting, but it's not.

10:44.603 --> 10:45.853
It's just hostility.

10:45.895 --> 10:49.941
No, I-I'm pretty sure

10:45.895 --> 10:49.941
it's flirting.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.318
Really?

10:51.359 --> 10:54.904
I guess I'm not as good

10:51.359 --> 10:54.904
at this as I thought.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.370
Before we're old?

11:09.169 --> 11:10.962
Son, these truffles

11:09.169 --> 11:10.962
are really expensive.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.507
And if you lost your money,

11:11.004 --> 11:13.507
it's really not my problem.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.882
But... (coughs)

11:14.924 --> 11:16.717
...they told me

11:14.924 --> 11:16.717
to get truffles.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.137
I don't know

11:16.759 --> 11:19.137
why, but...

11:19.179 --> 11:20.721
(coughing)

11:20.763 --> 11:22.723
...my parents tell me

11:20.763 --> 11:22.723
this is going to be

11:22.765 --> 11:25.393
a very special Thanksgiving.

11:25.435 --> 11:28.104
(choking up):

11:25.435 --> 11:28.104
My boss is a jackass anyway.

11:28.146 --> 11:31.107
Thank... (coughs) ...you.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.193
(hacking)

11:36.070 --> 11:37.738
I saw you talking

11:36.070 --> 11:37.738
to Francis, Lois.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.616
You couldn't stay out

11:37.780 --> 11:39.616
of it, could you?

11:39.658 --> 11:41.368
You had to

11:39.658 --> 11:41.368
drive a wedge.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.203
Hal, I told him

11:41.409 --> 11:43.203
that Piama was right

11:43.244 --> 11:45.372
and that he has

11:43.244 --> 11:45.372
to apologize to her.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.208
Okay.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.544
I'm not smart enough

11:48.249 --> 11:50.544
to figure out what you're up to,

11:50.585 --> 11:54.755
but when something bad

11:50.585 --> 11:54.755
happens, I am blaming you.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.469
Dad, what are these?

11:59.511 --> 12:00.761
Minced onions.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.472
Minced?

12:00.803 --> 12:02.472
I specifically

12:02.514 --> 12:03.764
asked for diced!

12:03.806 --> 12:04.932
Come on, Dad!

12:04.974 --> 12:06.767
Don't take that tone

12:04.974 --> 12:06.767
with me, Reese.

12:06.809 --> 12:07.768
This isn't fun.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.188
Fun? No, Dewey,

12:07.810 --> 12:10.188
this is not fun.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.939
Neither one of you

12:10.230 --> 12:11.939
seems to understand.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.650
We are not playing games here.

12:13.692 --> 12:14.942
There are lives at stake.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.027
No, there aren't.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.987
Okay, but it's very important.

12:18.029 --> 12:21.074
We're creating something

12:18.029 --> 12:21.074
special, something great...

12:21.824 --> 12:22.950
...something beautiful.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.785
Why is my wallet

12:22.992 --> 12:24.785
in my other pocket?

12:24.827 --> 12:25.953
Can we stay focused, Dad?

12:25.995 --> 12:28.415
There was $80 in here.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.708
REESE:

12:28.456 --> 12:29.708
I had to!

12:29.748 --> 12:31.000
The cheese course was a joke.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.169
Reese, you are

12:31.042 --> 12:33.169
in big trouble.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.796
And you know what?

12:33.211 --> 12:35.796
I have had it with this.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.798
I'm through!

12:37.840 --> 12:39.634
With the helping part.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.177
I'm still doing

12:39.676 --> 12:41.177
the eating part.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.387
Fine, go.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.598
I don't need you.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.598
I still have Dewey.

12:44.639 --> 12:48.435
He's twice the assistant

12:44.639 --> 12:48.435
entremetier that you'll ever be!

12:54.857 --> 12:56.610
Why haven't

12:54.857 --> 12:56.610
you talked to her yet?

12:56.651 --> 12:58.695
She won't let me.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.695
Every time I go near her,

12:58.737 --> 13:00.447
she walks out of the room.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.329
Piama... I know

13:08.371 --> 13:10.290
that you and I have

13:08.371 --> 13:10.290
had our differences...

13:10.331 --> 13:12.833
Oh, you mean the cold,

13:10.331 --> 13:12.833
uncomfortable silences

13:12.875 --> 13:15.211
broken by the occasional

13:12.875 --> 13:15.211
veiled insult?

13:15.253 --> 13:17.505
I'm not sure I would

13:15.253 --> 13:17.505
have put it like that.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.507
Look.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.426
Here's what I want to say.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.843
I believe in marriage.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.012
I believe in every marriage.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.848
And I think if you just

13:25.054 --> 13:27.848
listen to Francis,

13:27.890 --> 13:29.392
you'll like

13:27.890 --> 13:29.392
what you hear.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.854
Fine.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.315
Francis.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.989
I'll just leave

13:40.278 --> 13:42.989
you two to talk.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.535
LOIS:

13:45.908 --> 13:47.535
You know what?

13:47.577 --> 13:50.371
I didn't want to butt in,

13:47.577 --> 13:50.371
but I'm glad I did.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.457
What did you do, Lois?

13:50.413 --> 13:52.457
I talked to Piama.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.874
At least she seemed

13:52.499 --> 13:53.874
interested in listening

13:53.916 --> 13:55.543
to what Francis had to say.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.796
He's going to tell her exactly

13:55.585 --> 13:57.796
what I told him to say.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.880
What business is it of yours

13:59.922 --> 14:01.549
if I don't want to wear

13:59.922 --> 14:01.549
thong underpants?

14:01.591 --> 14:02.676
What?

14:02.717 --> 14:03.718
Piama, I didn't get to finish.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.136
See what happens, Lois?

14:05.178 --> 14:07.806
I don't care what shape

14:05.178 --> 14:07.806
we cut the mushrooms! I quit!

14:07.846 --> 14:09.974
This is why you're always

14:07.846 --> 14:09.974
going to be a little man

14:10.016 --> 14:11.476
living in a little world!

14:11.518 --> 14:13.060
I don't need you!

14:11.518 --> 14:13.060
I don't need anyone!

14:13.102 --> 14:17.691
(all talking over each other)

14:17.732 --> 14:20.819
FRANCIS:

14:17.732 --> 14:20.819
This is the worst

14:17.732 --> 14:20.819
Thanksgiving ever!

14:23.946 --> 14:27.074
This is the best

14:23.946 --> 14:27.074
Thanksgiving ever.

14:27.116 --> 14:30.537
I'm going to memorize this

14:27.116 --> 14:30.537
moment so I never forget it.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.212
This is the best

14:36.042 --> 14:39.212
Thanksgiving ever.

14:39.253 --> 14:43.466
I'm going to memorize this

14:39.253 --> 14:43.466
moment so I never forget it.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.427
Where is everybody?

14:46.469 --> 14:48.304
Fireworks?

14:48.346 --> 14:49.930
Bastards.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.932
No one came and got us.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.267
Well, the hell with them.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.064
(giggles)

14:58.815 --> 15:00.941
Let me do the talking.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.194
Good evening to you, sir.

15:03.236 --> 15:03.944
Oh, hi.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.112
Where is everyone?

15:05.154 --> 15:07.657
Studying. Probably.

15:07.699 --> 15:08.867
That would be my guess.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.243
What, is he asleep?

15:10.284 --> 15:12.119
I think he ate

15:10.284 --> 15:12.119
too much turkey.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.121
All that kryptonite...

15:14.163 --> 15:15.331
There's pie upstairs.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.165
Thank you.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.958
That's a very generous offer.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.210
I know the pilgrims,

15:19.252 --> 15:21.546
you know, facing that

15:19.252 --> 15:21.546
first bitter cold winter,

15:21.588 --> 15:23.590
Malcolm, he's gone.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.590
really would have

15:23.631 --> 15:26.384
appreciated a little bit

15:23.631 --> 15:26.384
of pie. That might... Ow!

15:30.805 --> 15:34.601
I think I'm getting better

15:30.805 --> 15:34.601
at reading her signals.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.276
(snorts, snores)

15:47.947 --> 15:49.365
Are you okay?

15:49.407 --> 15:52.827
(giggling)

15:52.869 --> 15:55.622
♪ I'm back. ♪

15:56.623 --> 16:02.462
Come on... let's do it.

16:07.550 --> 16:08.927
You gonna?

16:08.968 --> 16:10.553
I got to go.

16:14.056 --> 16:17.727
My brother will kick

16:14.056 --> 16:17.727
your ass if you tell.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.025
What is all

16:23.232 --> 16:25.025
this stuff?

16:25.067 --> 16:26.736
Piama, good, I need you.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.279
Here, stir this pot.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.197
All right, all right.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.492
I just have to stuff

16:30.239 --> 16:32.492
the acorn squash rings

16:32.533 --> 16:34.285
with roasted pepper

16:32.533 --> 16:34.285
and polenta,

16:34.327 --> 16:36.078
sear the scallops with...

16:36.120 --> 16:37.956
(buzzer buzzing)

16:37.997 --> 16:39.039
The monkfish!

16:39.081 --> 16:40.917
Where are the oven mitts?!

16:40.959 --> 16:42.042
You want me

16:40.959 --> 16:42.042
to look?

16:42.084 --> 16:43.419
No, keep stirring.

16:43.461 --> 16:46.339
No place mats, no tea towels...

16:43.461 --> 16:46.339
I need something.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.048
I'll get a towel

16:46.380 --> 16:48.048
from the bathroom.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.342
No, there's not enough time!

16:49.383 --> 16:51.636
It has to come out

16:49.383 --> 16:51.636
at exactly 5:38.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.721
Not 5:37, not 5:39.

16:53.763 --> 16:54.973
What are you

16:53.763 --> 16:54.973
going to do?

16:55.014 --> 16:57.684
There's only one thing I can do.

16:58.893 --> 16:59.853
Reese, no!

16:59.894 --> 17:00.895
Yes!

17:00.937 --> 17:02.146
(screaming)

17:02.188 --> 17:03.857
Clear me a space!

17:03.898 --> 17:04.858
Where?!

17:04.899 --> 17:06.776
Move the oven mitts!

17:13.825 --> 17:15.075
LOIS:

17:13.825 --> 17:15.075
Where is Malcolm?

17:15.117 --> 17:16.327
He knows he's

17:15.117 --> 17:16.327
supposed to be here.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.578
This is Thanksgiving.

17:17.620 --> 17:18.872
Yeah...

17:18.913 --> 17:21.666
he certainly

17:18.913 --> 17:21.666
wouldn't want to miss this.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.083
Well, I've done it.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.878
The feast is about to start.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.086
It's about time.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.129
I'm not even hungry.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.548
Can I be excused?

17:40.142 --> 17:43.103
(quiet oohing)

17:43.145 --> 17:44.814
LOIS:

17:43.145 --> 17:44.814
Oh, my...

17:44.856 --> 17:46.900
DEWEY:

17:44.856 --> 17:46.900
Wow.

17:46.941 --> 17:49.235
Mmm...

17:58.160 --> 17:59.119
PIAMA:

17:58.160 --> 17:59.119
Wow.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.119
Oh!

17:59.161 --> 18:01.998
REESE:

17:59.161 --> 18:01.998
The turkey monkfish.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.124
(laughter and applause)

18:04.166 --> 18:05.418
I'll say grace.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.130
Thank you, Lord,

18:08.170 --> 18:10.130
for giving me the talent

18:10.172 --> 18:13.133
to express my love for my family

18:10.172 --> 18:13.133
in the only way I know how.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.969
Amen.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.223
Hey, party people.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.141
Oh, my God,

18:19.265 --> 18:21.141
you're drunk!

18:21.183 --> 18:23.770
What on earth is wrong with you?

18:23.811 --> 18:27.732
I will tell you what is

18:23.811 --> 18:27.732
wrong with me, on earth.

18:27.774 --> 18:32.152
The reason why I drank

18:27.774 --> 18:32.152
is because I'm a coward,

18:32.194 --> 18:33.446
and probably gay.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.615
I let a perfect

18:33.487 --> 18:35.615
opportunity

18:35.656 --> 18:37.366
just slip right through my

18:35.656 --> 18:37.366
fingers, and, you know,

18:37.408 --> 18:39.159
I thought

18:37.408 --> 18:39.159
I'd cap it off

18:39.201 --> 18:40.954
by getting

18:39.201 --> 18:40.954
stinking drunk.

18:40.995 --> 18:44.164
What do you think of your

18:40.995 --> 18:44.164
golden boy now, Mom?

18:44.206 --> 18:46.375
What "golden boy"?!

18:46.417 --> 18:47.418
Get in your room!

18:47.460 --> 18:48.753
I'll deal with you later.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.755
I will go to my room

18:50.797 --> 18:51.756
when I am finished

18:51.798 --> 18:54.008
with what I have to say.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.179
(retching)

18:59.221 --> 19:01.599
(groaning in disgust)

19:02.850 --> 19:04.268
Hey, come on.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.020
Some of the shrimp

19:04.310 --> 19:06.020
is still good.

19:09.231 --> 19:12.192
I just left her there on

19:09.231 --> 19:12.192
the floor and staggered home.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.194
To shower us

19:12.234 --> 19:14.194
with affection.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.822
Yeah.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.198
Well, it's nothing

19:15.863 --> 19:18.198
to be ashamed of.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.660
I mean, sure, the distance

19:18.240 --> 19:20.660
wasn't much of a factor,

19:20.701 --> 19:22.244
but the volume was impressive.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.831
So you going to see

19:22.286 --> 19:24.831
this girl again?

19:24.872 --> 19:26.124
Are you kidding?

19:26.165 --> 19:27.500
I can't believe it.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.920
We were alone.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.920
She wanted to do it.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.421
I was right there.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.882
How could I have

19:32.463 --> 19:34.882
chickened out?

19:34.924 --> 19:38.218
Dude, you didn't take

19:34.924 --> 19:38.218
advantage of a drunk chick.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.221
Mom must be slipping.

19:41.263 --> 19:44.809
All I got was no TV,

19:41.263 --> 19:44.809
video games or computer.

19:44.851 --> 19:45.935
I have to clean all

19:45.977 --> 19:47.603
the kitchen and bathroom tile

19:45.977 --> 19:47.603
with a toothbrush,

19:47.645 --> 19:49.313
wash every window in the house

19:49.355 --> 19:52.608
and change Jamie's diaper

19:49.355 --> 19:52.608
for the next six months, but...

19:52.650 --> 19:55.235
No, you got, like,

19:52.650 --> 19:55.235
nine other things

19:55.277 --> 19:56.403
after you passed out.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.280
You have got

19:56.445 --> 19:58.280
to do something, Lois.

19:58.322 --> 20:01.241
Piama just asked me for

19:58.322 --> 20:01.241
a ride to the bus station.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.119
I thought you didn't

20:01.283 --> 20:03.119
want me to interfere.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.746
Okay, I take back

20:03.161 --> 20:05.746
everything I said.

20:05.788 --> 20:09.249
You can interfere as much

20:05.788 --> 20:09.249
as you want-- just fix it!

20:09.291 --> 20:10.250
Well...

20:10.292 --> 20:11.544
I'm ready.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.550
Piama, there's just one

20:14.755 --> 20:17.550
thing I want to say.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.927
I know that breaking

20:17.591 --> 20:19.927
up is painful,

20:19.969 --> 20:23.056
but I think in the long run,

20:19.969 --> 20:23.056
you'll find it's for the best.

20:23.097 --> 20:25.432
For the best?

20:23.097 --> 20:25.432
Well, Francis,

20:23.097 --> 20:25.432
let's be serious.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.476
This marriage never

20:25.474 --> 20:27.476
had a chance.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.269
I just think

20:27.518 --> 20:29.269
that you'll be

20:29.311 --> 20:31.772
better friends once

20:29.311 --> 20:31.772
you're divorced.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.733
Who said we're

20:31.814 --> 20:33.733
getting divorced?

20:33.774 --> 20:35.151
I love Francis!

20:35.193 --> 20:36.903
FRANCIS:

20:35.193 --> 20:36.903
You can't stand to

20:35.193 --> 20:36.903
see anyone happy,

20:36.944 --> 20:38.278
can you, Mom?

20:38.320 --> 20:39.279
Come on, honey,

20:39.321 --> 20:40.280
let's go get my things.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.908
They're out in the trash.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.159
Sorry, honey.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.452
That's okay, sweetie.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.288
Once again,

20:45.494 --> 20:48.288
you've underestimated us.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.373
We're not the little

20:49.415 --> 20:52.376
dancing monkeys

20:49.415 --> 20:52.376
you thought we were.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.963
Thanks, honey.
