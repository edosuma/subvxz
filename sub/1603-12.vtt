into a publicly traded company.

01:35.016 --> 01:37.049
Now, part of us going public

God, Dad, that's amazing.

02:20.918 --> 02:22.550
Yeah, it's a miracle, son.

02:22.552 --> 02:26.987
I mean, I woke up
this morning...

02:26.989 --> 02:30.790
so conscious of
all the harm I've done

02:30.792 --> 02:33.125
to each and every one of y'all.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.127
I'm not asking y'all
to forgive me.

02:37.462 --> 02:39.129
Just open up the gifts.

02:39.131 --> 02:40.997
I don't want nothing from you.

I should've never
tried to control you.

03:02.785 --> 03:04.017
That was wrong.

03:04.019 --> 03:06.152
And I'm sorry
about Camilla.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.989
So when your
album drops,

03:09.991 --> 03:12.992
you'll have your own jet
to tour anywhere you want.

That's the Lion of Judah,

03:35.214 --> 03:37.948

exactly what I was doing

when I tried
to take Michelle.

03:40.118 --> 03:43.185
<i> I was just trying</i>

03:43.187 --> 03:44.853

03:44.855 --> 03:46.688
And that was wrong.

03:46.690 --> 03:49.691
So when the IPO
closes on Friday,

03:49.693 --> 03:52.894
I'm going to announce the start
of the Lyon Foundation

03:52.896 --> 03:55.129
and you're going to have
$100,000,000

04:36.499 --> 04:38.832

04:43.737 --> 04:45.938
I was misdiagnosed.

04:45.940 --> 04:47.906
The angel of death
came to get me

04:47.908 --> 04:49.507

04:49.509 --> 04:50.741

04:53.378 --> 04:56.345

04:56.347 --> 04:58.547

That's good news.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.582

05:00.584 --> 05:02.517

05:08.289 --> 05:09.755

05:09.757 --> 05:11.590

05:17.029 --> 05:19.663
What'd you get?

05:48.492 --> 05:49.725
JAMAL:
Thanks, Becky.

05:49.727 --> 05:51.727
Mm-hmm.
Uh, y'all want anything?

05:51.729 --> 05:53.295
I'm good.
Yeah. Go crazy.

05:53.297 --> 05:55.964
This'll be the last cup of tea
I serve any of you.

05:55.966 --> 05:58.566
Jamal has promoted me
to A&R.

05:58.568 --> 05:59.800
Yeah.  BECKY:  Mm-hmm!

05:59.802 --> 06:01.001
Yeah!

06:01.003 --> 06:02.769

06:02.771 --> 06:06.005
Congratulations, Becky.
Thanks.

06:06.007 --> 06:08.140

I've been meaning to ask you,

06:08.142 --> 06:10.142
what type of
black girl named "Becky"?

06:10.144 --> 06:12.644

nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

I do.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.357
You know what I mean?

06:31.359 --> 06:33.525
He built this
whole empire for us.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.026
Hell of a gift he gave you.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.193
HAKEEM:
I don't understand.

06:36.195 --> 06:37.494
If Dad not dyin',

06:37.496 --> 06:38.761
why he even pick a successor?

06:38.763 --> 06:39.995
It don't make no sense.

06:39.997 --> 06:41.363
Because we are a company

06:41.365 --> 06:42.797
that's about to go public.

06:42.799 --> 06:44.965
And what it does
is that it saves us

06:44.967 --> 06:46.433
in case some random white dude
wants to come

06:46.435 --> 06:47.834
and try to buy it from under us.
Right, Dre?

06:47.836 --> 06:49.635
Shareholders like to know

06:49.637 --> 06:51.269
there's a succession
plan, sure.

06:53.772 --> 06:55.506
Point is, I need
y'all's support.

06:55.508 --> 06:57.140
You know, I don't think
I even want to do it

06:57.142 --> 06:58.975
if I don't have it.

06:58.977 --> 07:01.010
So if we're not cool with it,
you're not gonna do it?

07:01.012 --> 07:02.511
Is that what you saying?

07:02.513 --> 07:04.846
What I'm saying is
that I'm not him

07:04.848 --> 07:06.380

07:06.382 --> 07:08.382

decision that I make...

07:08.384 --> 07:11.051

that<i> you</i> make?

07:11.053 --> 07:12.318
Yeah, Dre.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.485
I mean,
you're the MBA,

07:13.487 --> 07:15.119
so tell me if
you ever heard

07:15.121 --> 07:17.154
of a corporation where
the buck doesn't stop somewhere.

07:17.156 --> 07:18.388
HAKEEM:
But what about my album?

07:18.390 --> 07:19.655
Will I be in charge

07:19.657 --> 07:21.289
of how my album gets dropped

07:21.291 --> 07:22.923
and what gigs I do to promote it?
Hell, yeah.

07:24.292 --> 07:26.126
I-I mean...

07:26.128 --> 07:27.861
You know, I do think
that your album

07:27.863 --> 07:29.662
should be pushed back,
just, like,

07:29.664 --> 07:30.896
one to two months...

07:30.898 --> 07:32.964
No, I... my album is
supposed to come out

07:32.966 --> 07:34.865
the day the IPO come out.
All right.

07:34.867 --> 07:37.033
But it's not smart programming

07:37.035 --> 07:38.501
to push your album
when my album

07:38.503 --> 07:40.636

so let my situation

07:40.638 --> 07:42.304
die down a little bit...

07:42.306 --> 07:44.472
and then Dad says he wants
to release an album,

07:44.474 --> 07:45.906

07:45.908 --> 07:47.307

11:08.266 --> 11:10.266
I got a concert
sold out.

11:10.268 --> 11:13.135
And a black man's
still alive.

11:13.137 --> 11:14.769
I got my man back, too.

11:14.771 --> 11:16.003
I needed you.

11:16.005 --> 11:18.138
I just want you
to know that...

11:18.140 --> 11:19.239
No, no, no.

11:19.241 --> 11:20.406
Can the wishy-washy
stuff, man.

11:20.408 --> 11:22.074
We got, we got
business to do.

11:22.076 --> 11:24.409
You got to look after Cookie for me.
How's she doing?

11:24.411 --> 11:26.944
She's got it in for me--
I'll show you

11:26.946 --> 11:29.279
the security cam footage;
she really wasn't happy

11:29.281 --> 11:30.813
about a brother having
good health.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.880
Put it that way.

11:36.251 --> 11:39.620
So we are building a case
against Lucious right here.

11:39.622 --> 11:42.255
And we would very much
like your cooperation.

11:42.257 --> 11:44.090
You ain't dragging me
into that.

11:44.092 --> 11:46.192
I don't got to do it--
I know my rights.

11:46.194 --> 11:48.194
Absolutely.

11:48.196 --> 11:49.461
Anyway, we already
have a witness.

11:49.463 --> 11:51.262
You ever heard of Shyne Johnson?

11:51.264 --> 11:52.997
Nope, don't know
who you're talking about.

11:52.999 --> 11:55.666
LUCIOUS:<i> I killed you Bunkie,</i>
<i> just like Shyne's boys.</i>

11:55.668 --> 11:59.703
You kept threatening me
with the wise men.

11:59.705 --> 12:03.606
NELSON: We busted Shyne on about
a thousand different counts,

12:03.608 --> 12:05.774
and he's trying to cut a deal
to give us Lucious.

12:05.776 --> 12:10.678
He says that, um, Lucious killed
your cousin Bunkie Williams.

12:12.981 --> 12:14.982
Tell us what you
know, Cookie.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.284
Come on.

12:17.286 --> 12:20.287
We know your husband's the one
really running the show.

12:20.289 --> 12:22.489
If you testify
against him,

12:22.491 --> 12:25.058
we'll reduce
your sentence.

12:25.060 --> 12:27.693
You're looking
at 25 years, Cookie.

12:27.695 --> 12:30.195
Give us Lucious, and
it'll be less than five.

12:32.665 --> 12:35.700
CARTER: We know that you
want to see Lucious go down.

12:35.702 --> 12:37.468
Well, here's your chance.

12:41.572 --> 12:43.973
Find yourself
another snitch.

12:46.643 --> 12:48.210
I fulfilled my
obligation with you.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.750
Taxi!

12:55.752 --> 12:58.085
Taxi...!

13:13.234 --> 13:16.236
Okay, we both wanted to
hurt him, and we did that.

13:16.238 --> 13:18.004
All right?

13:18.006 --> 13:20.940
But Creedmoor, that's
never gonna be my company.

13:20.942 --> 13:23.008
I want Empire.

13:30.615 --> 13:32.616
<i>A Curious Mind.</i>

13:32.618 --> 13:36.619
This is an inspirational
book, Hakeem.

13:36.621 --> 13:39.588
I'm... I'm happy
you're reading this.

13:39.590 --> 13:41.590
You know who else
you should read?

13:41.592 --> 13:43.224
Who?

13:43.226 --> 13:44.225
Machiavelli.

13:44.227 --> 13:45.859
I already read that.

13:45.861 --> 13:47.794
You talking
about the Italian guy,

13:47.796 --> 13:49.629
he be writing books
about power.

13:49.631 --> 13:51.464
Hmm.

13:51.466 --> 13:53.899
So that means that you also
know that he had a disdain

13:53.901 --> 13:56.534
for what he called
"effeminate princes."

13:56.536 --> 13:58.536
I'm not letting Jamal
go out like that.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.405
Oh, come on, Keem, I'm not
talking about Jamal being gay.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.807
I'm talking about
a battle we can win.

14:03.809 --> 14:05.475
You are gonna be
a much better king,

14:05.477 --> 14:07.143
now that you have
to fight for it.

14:07.145 --> 14:08.711
Fight for what?

14:08.713 --> 14:11.113
Have you ever heard
of a hostile takeover?

14:13.649 --> 14:15.549
We're gonna need Andre.

14:17.151 --> 14:19.719
And you got to be cool, Keem.

14:19.721 --> 14:23.122
With Jamal, the concert,
everything.

14:23.124 --> 14:25.157
Think you can
handle it?

14:29.795 --> 14:31.328
♪ That's what the DJ spins ♪

14:31.330 --> 14:33.463
ANNOUNCER: Everyone,
please take your places.

14:33.465 --> 14:35.164
The press conference will be
starting in three minutes.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.133
(reporters clamor for Lucious)

14:38.135 --> 14:40.135
You don't have a problem with
Cookie you think you have.

14:40.137 --> 14:41.769
I trailed her myself.

14:41.771 --> 14:43.170
Only thing she's done,

14:43.172 --> 14:45.005
besides sit down and eat,

14:45.007 --> 14:46.006
is see her PO.

14:46.008 --> 14:47.240
But the real problem is--

14:47.242 --> 14:49.242
Rita Ora's pulled
out of the show.

14:49.244 --> 14:50.476
Because of Cookie.

14:50.478 --> 14:52.411
Team Cookie all
the way, homie.

14:52.413 --> 14:54.146
Let me holla at
you real quick.

14:54.148 --> 14:56.348
Yeah. Look, we not letting him
treat us like punks no more.

14:56.350 --> 14:58.350
You hear me?

14:58.352 --> 15:00.417
You ever heard of
a hostile takeover?

15:02.420 --> 15:04.421
Accept that Jamal won.

15:04.423 --> 15:06.423
Why you looking
so nervous?

15:06.425 --> 15:07.624
(hesitant laugh)

15:07.626 --> 15:09.025
I can't believe
I'm here.

15:09.027 --> 15:11.027
I mean, with all
these stars.

15:11.029 --> 15:13.195
You are the star.

15:13.197 --> 15:14.829
I want you out,
front and center.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.530
You know my song,
"Whatever Makes You Happy"?

15:16.532 --> 15:18.532
Yeah, I grew up
on that song.

15:18.534 --> 15:20.333
Then you should
be singing it.

15:20.335 --> 15:22.968
Titan, this is
Michelle White,

15:22.970 --> 15:25.203
one of the greatest gospel
singers I've ever met.

15:25.205 --> 15:27.205
She's gonna do "Whatever
Makes You Happy."

15:27.207 --> 15:29.207
That's the one.

15:29.209 --> 15:30.942
Hey. Come on.
That's your star.

15:30.944 --> 15:32.543
Sorry-- you have to start
the press conference now.

15:32.545 --> 15:33.544
Okay.

15:33.546 --> 15:34.711
You're gonna
love her, baby.

15:36.113 --> 15:37.947
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:37.949 --> 15:41.150
we have a Philadelphia native
here with us tonight.

15:41.152 --> 15:43.018
You call her a legend.

15:43.020 --> 15:44.886
I call her a goddess.

15:44.888 --> 15:47.955
Miss Patti Labelle has agreed
to be a part of our show.

15:52.727 --> 15:55.161
I have an
announcement to make.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.163
Uh, all the artists
participating

15:57.165 --> 15:58.797
in "The Lucious
Lyon Sound,"

15:58.799 --> 16:02.634
we've all agreed to give
ten percent of our proceeds

16:02.636 --> 16:05.703
to "Black Lives Matter."

16:10.642 --> 16:13.010
Okay, we got time
for a couple questions.

16:13.012 --> 16:15.045
(reporters clamor for Lucious)

16:15.047 --> 16:18.048
Lucious, with your IPO closing
on the same day as your concert,

16:18.050 --> 16:20.050
how are you going
to manage your music

16:20.052 --> 16:22.018
and running a public company?

16:22.020 --> 16:24.320
Well, fortunately for me, I
have my son, Jamal, MAN: Yo!

16:24.322 --> 16:26.322
who's now the vice-chairman...
I got something to say

16:26.324 --> 16:27.890
about all of that!
JAMAL:  All right.

16:27.892 --> 16:29.725
Everybody, please give it up
for Black Rambo.

16:29.727 --> 16:30.726
He'll be performing at The Lucious
Lyon Sound concert with...

16:30.728 --> 16:32.260
BLACK RAMBO:
Wait-- what?!

16:32.262 --> 16:35.896
I'm not performing nothing if
you running Empire, batty man.

16:35.898 --> 16:37.831
The hell you just call me? Wait,
wait, wait, hold up, hold up.

16:37.833 --> 16:39.265
BLACK RAMBO:
It's the death of hip-hop...

16:39.267 --> 16:41.000
That's enough.
You can leave now.

16:41.002 --> 16:44.003
I'll go, and so should every
real emcee on your roster.

16:44.005 --> 16:45.537
Gonna put a fairy
on the billboard...

16:45.539 --> 16:47.372
Hey, get his ass up out of here.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.773
Last time I checked,
hip hop was born

16:48.775 --> 16:50.107
from the struggle
of real men.

16:50.109 --> 16:51.876
Or did you forget
all that?

16:51.878 --> 16:53.944
Ain't no place in this game
for them bitches.

16:58.782 --> 17:00.849
STEVE CHO: Look, if we publically
attack Black Rambo, he'll respond

17:00.851 --> 17:02.717
and dominate the news cycle
right up to the concert.

17:02.719 --> 17:04.452
JAMAL: No, and that's exactly
what I don't want.

17:04.454 --> 17:05.453
The concert stays about Dad.

17:05.455 --> 17:07.455
I'll release
a statement,

17:07.457 --> 17:10.324
saying that bigotry has
no place at Empire,

17:10.326 --> 17:13.960
and that we welcome
Black Rambo's exit.

17:13.962 --> 17:15.394
It's perfect.

17:15.396 --> 17:16.962
Simple. ANDRE: Are
you kidding me?

17:16.964 --> 17:18.797
It's a terrible move.

17:18.799 --> 17:21.132
It-it'll weaken the stock price
and cost share holders millions.

17:21.134 --> 17:23.400
Thank you for that, Andre.
Thank you for the support.

17:23.402 --> 17:25.335
It's not about you,
it's about Empire.

17:25.337 --> 17:27.203
No, Empire is Jamal,

17:27.205 --> 17:28.671
and Jamal is Empire,

17:28.673 --> 17:30.305
as are you. ANDRE: What am I?

17:30.307 --> 17:31.706
Empire or Jamal?

17:31.708 --> 17:33.607
Or is Empire now
the cult of Jamal?

17:35.176 --> 17:38.178
We're launching an IPO, right?

17:38.180 --> 17:40.713
This is not the time
to take a bold stand

17:40.715 --> 17:43.582
in a matter that alienates
so many of our customers.

17:43.584 --> 17:46.551
No offense, Empire.

17:50.421 --> 17:52.221
Yeah. You all good, baby.

17:52.223 --> 17:53.222
Mm-hmm.

17:53.224 --> 17:54.890
A'ight.

17:57.260 --> 17:58.693
I got that.

17:58.695 --> 18:00.161
I need to talk to my son.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.062
Nah, it's cool, man.

18:02.064 --> 18:03.063
It's cool.

18:03.065 --> 18:04.564
All right, then.

18:04.566 --> 18:06.065
(chuckles)

18:11.003 --> 18:14.071
I don't like what
Lucious did to you.

18:15.406 --> 18:17.039
You saying Jamal
don't deserve it?

18:17.041 --> 18:19.441
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

18:19.443 --> 18:21.075
I'm saying
you do, too.

18:21.077 --> 18:24.144
I think Lucious should have
gave it to both of y'all.

18:29.016 --> 18:30.216
You still with Anika?

18:30.218 --> 18:32.451
I was never with Anika.

18:32.453 --> 18:35.019
I mean "with" on Creedmoor.

18:36.021 --> 18:37.454
I want Empire.

18:43.426 --> 18:46.494
Let's build our own,
you and me.

18:47.429 --> 18:49.096
I did it before.

18:49.098 --> 18:51.098
You know
I'm good, Hakeem.

18:51.100 --> 18:52.732
And I know
how good you are.

18:52.734 --> 18:56.769
Much better
than your father realizes.

18:56.771 --> 18:59.304
Much better than
you even realize.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.205
We can do this; come on.

19:02.907 --> 19:05.775
Look, Mom, we don't got to
start from scratch no more.

19:05.777 --> 19:08.177
What you talking about, boy?

19:17.586 --> 19:19.587
What is this?

19:19.589 --> 19:21.589
You leaving me?

19:21.591 --> 19:24.258
Uh, well, you've
already left me.

19:24.260 --> 19:26.727
Listen, you got
the wrong idea.

19:26.729 --> 19:28.729
I never cheated on
you with Michelle.

19:28.731 --> 19:31.131
You may have not
screwed her,

19:31.133 --> 19:34.067
but you shared something
very intimate.

19:34.069 --> 19:35.468
(scoffs)

19:35.470 --> 19:37.102
Would it make a
difference if I told you

19:37.104 --> 19:38.903
that she's as messed
up as the rest of us?

19:38.905 --> 19:40.804
I mean, Lucious
offered her a contract,

19:40.806 --> 19:42.572
and she left the church.

19:42.574 --> 19:45.040
Oh, wow, I'm so sorry
for you, babe.

19:46.976 --> 19:48.810
You know, I don't know
what's worse--

19:48.812 --> 19:52.246
that you left me
for a phony,

19:52.248 --> 19:55.249
or that you conceded
Empire to Jamal

19:55.251 --> 19:57.251
without even
putting up a fight.

19:57.253 --> 19:58.652
I'm going to Gina's.

19:58.654 --> 20:00.720
She said I could stay
in her guest room.

20:06.793 --> 20:08.860
(sighs heavily)

20:18.103 --> 20:20.504
Hakeem.

20:20.506 --> 20:22.572
Yeah, it's me.

20:24.041 --> 20:26.108
I changed my mind.

20:28.211 --> 20:30.645
Tell me why I shouldn't
throw this drink

20:30.647 --> 20:33.047
in your bitch-ass face?

20:33.049 --> 20:35.049
You sure this was
a good idea?

20:35.051 --> 20:36.884
Are you sure you
want this company?

20:36.886 --> 20:38.752
'Cause you'd never get up
off the floor, bitch.

20:42.355 --> 20:43.455
Look, I'm sorry.

20:43.457 --> 20:44.789
I'm sorry, she was
talking trash.

20:44.791 --> 20:45.990
What do you expect?

20:45.992 --> 20:47.057
I'm no punk.

20:47.059 --> 20:48.391
Go back to jail, bitch!

20:48.393 --> 20:49.859
HAKEEM: Mom, stop.
Anika, chill out.

20:49.861 --> 20:50.860
You been harassing me
from the moment you arrived!

20:50.862 --> 20:52.995
(grunting, blows thudding)

20:52.997 --> 20:55.630
Let it go!
You two deserve each other!

20:55.632 --> 20:56.631
Mom, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Chill, chill, chill.

20:56.633 --> 20:57.965
Come on!
Hey, chill, chill.

20:57.967 --> 20:59.565
ANIKA: Who's Boo Boo
Kitty now, bitch?

20:59.567 --> 21:00.600
ANDRE: Mom, come on...

21:00.602 --> 21:02.467
Don't touch, me, Keem.
All right, okay, okay.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.802
You okay? Run them pearls, ho!

21:03.804 --> 21:04.903
Bring it!

21:04.905 --> 21:05.971
I'll bust it! Off of me!

21:06.173 --> 21:07.639
Bitch! Oh, you bitch!
...your throat!

21:07.641 --> 21:09.507
ANDRE: Let her go, come on,
Mom... Mom!

21:09.509 --> 21:11.041
...pearls off,
right off your neck!

21:11.043 --> 21:12.042
ANDRE:
Let her go, Mom, Mom...

21:12.044 --> 21:13.176
Get off me, bitch!

21:13.178 --> 21:14.810
Come on...
Mom, calm down. Mom!

21:14.812 --> 21:16.144
Mom! Mom! Whoa.
COOKIE: All right.

21:16.146 --> 21:17.979
ANIKA: I'll be okay. Mom...

21:17.981 --> 21:19.847
Hey, look, Mom, we here out of
hate for the same man, right?

21:19.849 --> 21:23.150
Right? And, Mom, if we're gonna
make a play for Empire, we need her.

21:23.152 --> 21:26.052
Why do we need her? Because Anika's got
the relationship with Tony Trichter,

21:26.054 --> 21:27.353
that's why.
Who the hell is that?

21:27.355 --> 21:28.687
It's a famous
corporate raider.

21:28.689 --> 21:29.988
We need somebody
on his level

21:29.990 --> 21:31.723
if we're gonna be serious
about this, Mom.

21:31.725 --> 21:33.658
ANIKA: They call him
"Tricky Trichter"

21:33.660 --> 21:35.426
'cause he's the best
at hostile takeovers.

21:35.428 --> 21:38.529
He was gonna buy into Creedmoor
'cause his grandson is a rapper,

21:38.531 --> 21:39.596
so it's not gonna be
hard to convince him

21:39.598 --> 21:40.797
to buy into Empire, instead.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.934
Look, we got to stick
together if we gonna do this.

21:53.876 --> 21:55.877
Okay.

21:55.879 --> 21:59.446
Okay, I will work
with Boo Boo Kitty this time.

(laughs)
You, you got somethin'.

25:20.877 --> 25:22.710
You're not just giving me

25:22.712 --> 25:25.012
a load of crap because you want
my money now, are you?

25:25.014 --> 25:27.114
Oh, yeah, we giving you
a load of crap.

25:27.116 --> 25:29.316
But if we can sell Kid Fo-Fo,
we can certainly

25:29.318 --> 25:31.518
sell this punk-ass
grandson of yours.

25:31.520 --> 25:34.320
(laughs)

25:34.322 --> 25:37.989
You know, I've launched
23 hostile takeovers,

25:37.991 --> 25:40.458
and only six have failed.

25:40.460 --> 25:41.959
Scotch?
Oh, yes, neat. Thank you.

25:41.961 --> 25:44.828
It's not easy,
but it can be done.

25:44.830 --> 25:46.529
So, once the stock goes public,
the first thing we do is buy

25:46.531 --> 25:48.063
controlling interest
in the company.

25:48.065 --> 25:50.732
Exactly, and that can be
as much as 500 million.

25:50.734 --> 25:52.867
Now, I'm in it for 150

25:52.869 --> 25:55.302
if you release
my grandson's album.

25:55.304 --> 25:58.071
400. He ain't no Tupac.

25:58.073 --> 25:59.972
200.
300.

25:59.974 --> 26:02.908
250 is as much
as my board will approve.

26:02.910 --> 26:04.342
ANDRE: Getting the other
250's doable,

26:04.344 --> 26:05.976
but then we still have

26:05.978 --> 26:07.043
to topple the CEO.

26:07.045 --> 26:08.677
If you can successfully

26:08.679 --> 26:10.245
replace him with a shill,

26:10.247 --> 26:11.879
then you can replace
your board of directors,

26:11.881 --> 26:13.847
and the company is yours.

26:13.849 --> 26:16.349
But the most effective way
to replace a CEO

26:16.351 --> 26:18.084
is to replace
a board of directors.

26:18.086 --> 26:21.053
(chuckles) And you can't
do that with your current CEO.

26:21.055 --> 26:23.388
Tricky, isn't it?

26:23.390 --> 26:26.491
Ah-ha! That's why they call you
Tricky Trichter.

26:26.493 --> 26:28.326
Child, I don't want no chicken.

26:28.328 --> 26:31.395
I think some of my most
effective takeovers

26:31.397 --> 26:35.231
have been when I can nail
a CEO with a good scandal.

26:35.233 --> 26:37.266
Prostitutes, drugs--
you name it.

26:37.268 --> 26:41.269
So, Lucious would have
to be caught in a scandal?

26:41.271 --> 26:43.237
And your raise
your other 250 million,

26:43.239 --> 26:46.673
you got yourself your Empire.

26:55.682 --> 26:58.717
I just want to know...

26:58.719 --> 27:01.886
if I tore
my family apart again...

27:01.888 --> 27:04.255
for no reason.

27:04.257 --> 27:08.025
Come on, girl,
why you gonna ask me this?

27:09.460 --> 27:12.528
Did Lucious kill Bunkie?

27:15.865 --> 27:19.300
You know, it's crazy...

27:19.302 --> 27:21.302
the things that...

27:21.304 --> 27:23.704
can make a man go back to using.

27:26.541 --> 27:28.542
Why?

27:28.544 --> 27:30.710
Bunkie was trying to...

27:30.712 --> 27:32.745
shake him down for $3 million.

27:32.747 --> 27:35.981
Threatening
to pull down the IPO.

27:35.983 --> 27:38.048
(gasps, sighs)

27:39.784 --> 27:43.153
What happened to us, Cookie?

27:43.155 --> 27:45.722
We was family.

27:45.724 --> 27:47.090
We had each other's back. I...

27:47.092 --> 27:48.758
I raised your boys.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.426
Bunkie was my brother.

27:50.428 --> 27:52.661
Lucious...

27:52.663 --> 27:54.962
Lucious was my hero.

27:56.664 --> 27:58.331
(quiet laugh)

28:00.434 --> 28:02.802
It's a damn shame.

28:02.804 --> 28:04.570
Jamal is my everything.

28:04.572 --> 28:06.104
I can't lose him.

28:06.106 --> 28:07.605
You're not gonna
lose him, Cookie.

28:07.607 --> 28:11.008
Just go talk to him,
make it right.

28:15.913 --> 28:18.381
(doorbell chimes)

28:22.352 --> 28:23.752
You came to kiss Jamal's ass,

28:23.754 --> 28:25.253
you got to go
to his place for that.

28:25.255 --> 28:27.455
I'm here to talk to you.

28:27.457 --> 28:29.756
You know, you're like
a son to me, come on.

28:31.592 --> 28:32.992
WOMAN: Okay, places for
rehearsal, everybody.

29:11.457 --> 29:13.857
but hold up a second.

29:24.301 --> 29:26.402
All my life all I wanted was
for that man to love me.

29:26.404 --> 29:29.304
I know, baby.
That's all I ever wanted, too.

29:31.340 --> 29:34.375
Look, Jamal...

29:34.377 --> 29:36.710
I just want you
to always remember

29:36.712 --> 29:39.512
what I told you,
all those years ago,

29:39.514 --> 29:41.914
in that visiting room.

29:45.517 --> 29:47.518
I got you.

29:47.520 --> 29:50.320

29:58.226 --> 30:01.861
I know you do.

30:01.863 --> 30:04.296
But, Ma, I need to know.

30:07.033 --> 30:10.935
That's between him
and the Lord, baby.

30:10.937 --> 30:12.403
VERNON:
<i> Look, Dre.</i>

30:12.405 --> 30:13.871
Your father's ringing the bell

30:13.873 --> 30:15.706
to take the company
public tomorrow.

30:15.708 --> 30:17.908
You're gonna run the business
as you always have, right?

30:17.910 --> 30:21.278
And Lucious will teach
Jamal the rest of it,

30:21.280 --> 30:23.446
and... it's everything
we ever wanted.

30:23.448 --> 30:25.181
Are you listening to yourself?

30:25.183 --> 30:27.783
What are you, a coward now?

30:27.785 --> 30:29.351
Empire should be mine
and you know it.

30:29.353 --> 30:31.052
Dre, Dre, Dre, Dre...
You stabbed me in the back!

30:31.054 --> 30:32.553
Dre what? Don't ever say
I stabbed you in the back.

30:32.555 --> 30:34.354
I'm here, now, for you.

30:34.356 --> 30:36.055
We still have this.
You're still my family, Dre.

30:36.057 --> 30:38.223
Dre?
Don't play that card with me!

30:38.225 --> 30:40.592
You're not my family.
You're upset.

30:40.594 --> 30:42.226
You're just my dad's thug.
Now, don't-don't do that.

30:42.228 --> 30:43.794
And now, you're Jamal's thug.
I raised you, boy.

30:43.796 --> 30:45.295
That's all you ever gonna be.

30:45.297 --> 30:46.462
You ain't supposed
to talk to me like that!

30:46.464 --> 30:48.697
What's wrong with you?

30:48.699 --> 30:50.932
You respect me!

30:50.934 --> 30:55.368
Now, I didn't
come here to fight.

30:55.370 --> 30:56.769
Now, get up,
so we can talk.

31:03.109 --> 31:04.608
Now, you get the hell
out of my house.

31:07.211 --> 31:10.413
Dre, Dre...

31:10.415 --> 31:11.781
RHONDA:
Vernon, get off of him!

31:11.783 --> 31:12.948
Vernon, stop it!

31:12.950 --> 31:14.416
Stop it!

31:14.418 --> 31:16.918
Vernon, get off of him!

31:16.920 --> 31:18.586
Baby!

31:18.588 --> 31:20.087
Baby, are you okay?

31:20.089 --> 31:21.555
Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh, my God!

31:21.557 --> 31:23.890
I'm good.
I'm okay, I'm okay.

31:23.892 --> 31:25.591
Let me see you.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

Hey.

Oh, my God, baby.

31:30.163 --> 31:32.263
Oh, my God.

31:32.265 --> 31:34.598
You came back.

31:34.600 --> 31:36.132
I want to fix this.

31:36.134 --> 31:38.767
I do.

31:38.769 --> 31:40.969
Me, too...

31:40.971 --> 31:42.337
Me, too.

31:42.339 --> 31:43.805
Baby, what the
hell happened here?

31:43.807 --> 31:45.973
Oh, my God.

31:45.975 --> 31:46.974
Oh, my God.

31:46.976 --> 31:48.041
All right.

31:50.344 --> 31:52.811
Uncle Vern?

31:55.481 --> 31:57.482
Oh, my God.

31:57.484 --> 31:59.250
Vern?
Oh, my God.

31:59.252 --> 32:00.718
Uncle Vern, come on...

32:02.020 --> 32:03.787
He doesn't have a pulse.

32:03.789 --> 32:06.156
We gotta call the police.
We gotta call the police.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.524
No, no! Dre! Dre!
Do not do that! Do not do that!

32:07.526 --> 32:09.259
Why not?
Because there's gonna be

32:09.261 --> 32:12.095
a-an investigation and a trial

37:25.304 --> 37:28.672
growing up in this world
as a black man.

37:28.674 --> 37:30.740
But then to be...

37:33.110 --> 37:34.610
...homosexual on top of that,

37:34.612 --> 37:36.144
that was just...
