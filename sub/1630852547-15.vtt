-I'm gonna be a dispatcher.
-Babe!

18:34.447 --> 18:36.280
Um, just a second.

18:40.102 --> 18:41.661
What are you doing?

18:42.530 --> 18:44.622
I can't marry you.

18:45.274 --> 18:46.624
What?

18:46.775 --> 18:51.111
I've been thinking about it
a lot lately, and I just...

18:51.131 --> 18:53.589
I think, I think
we should break up.

18:54.525 --> 18:58.261
Why? Did I do something wrong?

18:59.788 --> 19:02.098
I'm so sorry.

19:03.626 --> 19:05.718
I don't understand.

19:05.870 --> 19:07.145
I thought we were happy.

19:07.372 --> 19:09.981
No, we were. You're so great.

19:10.208 --> 19:12.316
It's just...

19:12.543 --> 19:15.069
Something doesn't feel right.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.993
Is this about Max?

19:22.662 --> 19:23.995
What?

19:24.164 --> 19:26.622
Did something happen
between you two?

19:27.500 --> 19:28.833
(stammers)

19:29.060 --> 19:30.743
-Unbelievable. Don't...
-No, Oscar, I...

19:30.837 --> 19:32.587
(softly):
Don't.

19:33.564 --> 19:35.006
Oh, where's my ring?

19:35.157 --> 19:39.552
I'm on Instagram Live,
and six people want to see it.

19:42.089 --> 19:43.830
Hey, you okay?

19:43.925 --> 19:45.758
-(all gasping)
-NICOLE: Oh, my God!

19:45.910 --> 19:48.577
-Oh, not his perfect face!
-What the hell?

19:48.746 --> 19:51.022
Oh, that is a lot of blood...

19:58.013 --> 19:59.864
I know you feel bad,
but don't worry,

19:59.941 --> 20:01.273
your next breakup
will be easier.

20:01.426 --> 20:05.018
Next? How many breakups
do you think I'm gonna have?

20:05.187 --> 20:07.446
Fifteen, twenty?

20:07.523 --> 20:09.523
Oh, no, wait,
you're not a gay man.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.783
Two or three.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.620
No. No more breakups,
no more relationships.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.881
Just me and the cats.

20:17.032 --> 20:20.459
Oh. Well, screw you,
Tabatha Christie.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.887
How are you holding up,
sweetheart?

20:23.114 --> 20:24.797
Oh, it's not one
of my better days.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.799
What? What are you
talking about?

20:26.893 --> 20:28.726
Your first breakup
had only one punch

20:28.877 --> 20:30.302
and nobody called the police.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.230
You crushed it.

20:32.381 --> 20:35.716
You just need to be strong.
It's gonna be okay.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.626
Thank you, Mother.

20:37.645 --> 20:40.529
-(crying): I was so close.
-I know, I know.
