YOU TAKE HOUSE'S VIEW

06:21.849 --> 06:22.916

GETTING UNDER YOUR SKIN.

NOTHING GETS TO ME

07:00.488 --> 07:01.855
AND YOU WON'T TAKE ME
AT MY WORD,

07:01.889 --> 07:03.056
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO PROVE YOU WRONG?

07:03.090 --> 07:04.592
I GUESS YOU CAN'T.

07:04.625 --> 07:08.596

CANNED GOODS BY THE CASELOAD.

07:15.903 --> 07:16.870
COULD BE METAL POISONING?

HE ALSO WORKED
WITH CUT-RATE CHEMICALS.

07:18.972 --> 07:21.609
COULD BE INHALATION
OF A TOXIC VOLATILE SUBSTRATE.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.711
(Thirteen)
TREATMENT FOR BOTH
IS CHELATION.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.112
GREAT WORK.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.482
ALKALINIZE HIS URINE
AND FORCE DIURESIS

07:28.516 --> 07:30.017
FOR HEAVY METAL POISONING.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.819
IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,
PUT HIM ON DIALYSIS

07:31.852 --> 07:33.921
FOR TOXIC INHALATION.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.823
I JUST SAID TREATMENT
FOR BOTH IS CHELATION.

07:35.856 --> 07:38.992

AND TRY DIALYSIS.

WHOA, WHOA.
SETTLE DOWN.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.637
IF WE CHELATE,

07:49.670 --> 07:50.771
WE'RE NOT GONNA KNOW
WHAT DISEASE HE HAD,

07:50.804 --> 07:53.006
WHICH MEANS WE'RE NOT
GONNA KNOW IF THE PROBLEM

07:53.040 --> 07:56.176
WAS IN HIS LOUSY OLD JOB
OR HIS STILL-LOUSY NEW LIFE.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.278
WHICH FOR THE PURPOSES
OF A METAPHORICAL ARGUMENT

07:58.311 --> 08:02.182
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.651
POINTLESS TO ARGUE.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.285
HE'S THE BOSS.
HE NEEDS HIS PUZZLE SOLVED.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.287
WHY BANG OUR HEADS
AGAINST THE WALL?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.156
[elevator bell dings]

08:09.189 --> 08:10.758
WHEN YOU'RE DONE
WITH THE PATIENT,

08:10.791 --> 08:13.894
TREAT FOREMAN BY BANGING
HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.228
WHERE'S THE DIALYSIS MACHINE?

08:15.262 --> 08:18.632
WHO CARES?
SINCE I ORDERED CHELATION.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.001
WE'LL FLIP A COIN, TELL HOUSE
IT WAS ONE DISEASE OR THE OTHER.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.003
WORST CASE, HE FINDS OUT AND
HE'S IMPRESSED WE DEFIED HIM.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.906
I'M SORRY. I ASKED YOU TO REMOVE
THE DIALYSIS EQUIPMENT,

08:25.939 --> 08:27.941
NOT THE CHELATION EQUIPMENT.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.177
AND DR. CUDDY ASKED ME
TO REMOVE ALL EQUIPMENT.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.813
SHE DE-AUTHORIZED
ALL TREATMENT.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.618
(Thirteen)
SHE WON'T LET US MAKE A MOVE

08:37.651 --> 08:38.786
UNTIL YOU AGREE
TO A SIT-DOWN

08:38.819 --> 08:40.554
WITH THE GODMOTHER
AND HER CONSIGLIERE.

08:40.588 --> 08:42.723
BITCH TO KING FOUR.

08:42.756 --> 08:43.691
CHECKMATE.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.826
PATIENT CAN'T USE HIS LEG.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.863
YOU HAVE TO CONCEDE.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.999
OR I COULD JUST KNOCK
ALL THE PIECES

08:52.032 --> 08:54.234
ONTO THE FLOOR.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.003
YOU'RE DISCHARGING ME?

08:56.036 --> 08:57.605
WE REALLY...

08:57.638 --> 09:00.073
DON'T HAVE
A GOOD LIE HERE, SO...

09:00.107 --> 09:01.842
(Thirteen)
YOU GOT CAUGHT
IN SOME POLITICS

09:01.875 --> 09:03.076
BETWEEN OUR BOSS
AND HIS BOSS,

09:03.110 --> 09:04.912
BUT YOU'LL BE OUT OF HERE
20 MINUTES TOPS.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.313
I'M NOT BETTER,
BUT YOU'RE KICKING ME OUT?

09:06.346 --> 09:07.881
WHICH IS WHY
IT'LL ONLY BE 20 MINUTES.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.116
SEE, THE DEAN OF MEDICINE
ACTS TOUGH,

09:09.149 --> 09:10.117
BUT SHE'S NOT REALLY.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.719
SHE'LL STEP IN,
READMIT YOU.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.854
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT SHE CARES
MORE ABOUT HIS TREATMENT

09:13.887 --> 09:15.656
THAN THE DOCTOR WHO'S
ACTUALLY TREATING HIM.

09:15.689 --> 09:19.660
PHIL, SHUT UP.

09:19.693 --> 09:23.296
CYRUS.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.932
JENNIFER.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.367
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.670
I READ ABOUT YOU
IN THE PAPER,

09:29.703 --> 09:32.606
SO I HOPPED THE FIRST
TRAIN FROM VIRGINIA.

09:32.640 --> 09:36.043
SO YOU READ THAT
HE STRUCK IT RICH?

09:36.076 --> 09:38.111
HE'S RIGHT.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.213
IT--IT MUST LOOK WEIRD.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.983
IT KIND OF IS WEIRD.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.886
WELL, WE'RE A LONG WAY
FROM THE THIRD STREET JETTY.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.288
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
YOU AGAIN AND SAY HI,

09:48.321 --> 09:51.959
SO...HI.

09:51.992 --> 09:56.997
HI.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.199
I WAS STARTING TO THINK
I'D NEVER FIND MY...

09:59.232 --> 10:02.636
BABY BEAR.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.948
OH, MY GOD.
I'M--I'M SO SORRY.

10:14.982 --> 10:15.983
I'M SO SORRY.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.085
I--I DON'T EVEN
FEEL NAUSEOUS.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.086
I DON'T KNOW WHY--

10:19.119 --> 10:20.988
YOUR HAND IS SHAKING.
OKAY.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.389
YOU'RE HAVING
A FOCAL SEIZURE.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.024
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

10:24.057 --> 10:26.093
IT MEANS YOU'RE NOT
GETTING DISCHARGED.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.699
(Taub)
WE WERE RIGHT
THAT IT'S A BRAIN ISSUE,

10:31.732 --> 10:33.734
BUT WRONG ABOUT TOXIC INHALATION
AND METAL POISONING.

10:33.767 --> 10:34.802
EVERYONE ELSE IS WAITING--

10:34.835 --> 10:36.203
THAT WAS TOTALLY
COURAGEOUS OF KHLOE

10:36.236 --> 10:37.805
TO TWEET ABOUT
HER WEIGHT GAIN.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.907
HOUSE, I'VE GOT A PATIENT
WITH A SEIZURE DISORDER

10:39.940 --> 10:41.008
WHO CAN'T WALK.

10:41.041 --> 10:41.809
ANOTHER ONE?

10:41.842 --> 10:43.677
THOUGHT WE KICKED OUT
THE LAST ONE.

10:43.711 --> 10:44.912
[door opens]

10:44.945 --> 10:47.147
OBVIOUSLY I'LL LET YOU
TREAT YOUR PATIENT.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.782
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:48.816 --> 10:53.954
WE GOT A PATIENT WITH A WALKING
DISORDER WHO CAN'T SEIZE.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.989
NO, WAIT.
I'M CLOSE, THOUGH, RIGHT?

10:56.023 --> 10:57.390
(Cuddy)
I WASN'T FINISHED.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.092
OF COURSE I'LL LET YOU
TREAT YOUR PATIENT

10:59.126 --> 11:00.794
IF YOU MEET ME HALFWAY.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.963
WELL, I GUESS
I'M NOT FINISHED EITHER.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.398
NO CLINIC HOURS
FOR THE NEXT QUARTER.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.834
YEAH,
THREE PARKING SPOTS,

11:06.867 --> 11:08.869
NEXT TO EACH OTHER,
SO I CAN PARK DIAGONALLY,

11:08.902 --> 11:11.939
AND THREE PAIRS
OF YOUR UNDERWEAR.

11:11.972 --> 11:16.910
I'M THINKING OF
TAKING UP SAILING.

11:16.944 --> 11:17.945
FORGET IT.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.247
TREAT YOUR PATIENT,
DON'T TREAT YOUR PATIENT.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.082
COME TO THE MEETING,
DON'T COME TO THE MEETING.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.283
I'M DONE PLAYING YOUR GAME.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.985
YOU REALIZE THE GAME
IS AUTOMATICALLY OVER

11:25.018 --> 11:29.389
WHEN THE LOSER LOSES, RIGHT?

11:29.422 --> 11:31.124
(Foreman)
NEUROLOGICAL LYME DISEASE

11:31.158 --> 11:33.961
EXPLAINS THE SEIZURES
AND THE PARALYSIS.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.163
BUT NOT THE FACT THAT CHASE
SEEMS TO BE TREATING YOU.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.999
HE CLAIMS HE CAN SWEAR OFF
SEX INDEFINITELY.

11:39.032 --> 11:43.837
ALSO CLAIMS THAT I AM A BOILING
CAULDRON OF REPRESSED RAGE.

11:43.871 --> 11:47.808
[computer beeps]

11:47.841 --> 11:50.143
YOUR THEORY IS IDIOTIC.

11:50.177 --> 11:55.783
THE PATIENT'S ANTIBODY TITERS
WERE NEGATIVE FOR LYME DISEASE.

11:55.816 --> 11:59.319
AND I SHARED A MOTEL ROOM
WITH YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.225
YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT
ABOUT THE ANTIBODY TITERS.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.360
HE'S A ROCK.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.830
HOW'S YOUR BROTHER--
HOMELESS GUY?

12:09.863 --> 12:11.198
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM
IN MONTHS!

12:11.231 --> 12:13.000
I DON'T KNOW.
WISH I DID.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.367
(Taub)
POSTURAL HYPOTENSION,

12:14.401 --> 12:16.904
WHICH COULD HAVE REDUCED
THE BLOOD SUPPLY TO HIS BRAIN.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.772
HE'D BE A MISERABLE WRETCH.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.140
ACTUALLY,
THE PROGNOSIS IS--

12:20.173 --> 12:21.141
OH, I'M SORRY.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.076
NO, I JUST MEANT HIS LIFE
IS GONNA UNRAVEL.

12:23.110 --> 12:26.113
IN FAIRNESS,
THAT APPLIES TO ANY DIAGNOSIS.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.448
[sighs]
WHY DO WE DO THIS?

12:28.481 --> 12:30.984
IT'S NOT POSTURAL HYPOTENSION.
HE'S NOT ORTHOSTATIC.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.953
(Taub)
HIS LIFE MAY UNRAVEL,
IT MAY NOT.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.922
HE'S NOT CHASING AFTER
MATERIAL THINGS.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.489
TOO BAD.
HE MIGHT ACTUALLY GET THOSE.

12:36.523 --> 12:37.825
(Taub)
HE'S LOOKING FOR LOVE.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.292
JUST TRACKED DOWN
AN OLD GIRLFRIEND.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.161
AND SHE'LL NEVER LIVE UP
TO THE MEMORY,

12:41.194 --> 12:43.263
AND THE THRILL OF FINDING
HER WILL WEAR OFF,

12:43.296 --> 12:47.000
AND HE WON'T EVEN BE ABLE
TO DREAM ABOUT BEING HAPPY.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.836
INTERESTING.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.904
THE PATIENT MAY HAVE FOUND
SOME LONG-AGO NOOKIE,

12:50.938 --> 12:52.906
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN HE HASN'T
HAD SOME IN THE MEANTIME.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.207
HERPES ENCEPHALITIS.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.877
EXPLAINS
THE NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.411
EEG TO CONFIRM,

12:58.445 --> 13:00.347
I.V. ACYCLOVIR TO TREAT.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.816
HOW'S FOREMAN'S
BP HOLDING?

13:02.850 --> 13:03.817
SAME.

13:03.851 --> 13:04.985
THAT'S STRANGE,

13:05.018 --> 13:07.821
SINCE I UNPLUGGED THE LEAD
30 SECONDS AGO.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.228
ADMIRABLE EFFORT.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.396
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT

13:16.429 --> 13:17.931
'CAUSE I'M SCARED
YOU MIGHT TURN GREEN

13:17.965 --> 13:20.300
AND RIP THROUGH
YOUR OWN CLOTHES.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.039
DOWN ON THE PATIENT'S ROMANCE

13:26.073 --> 13:30.110
BECAUSE YOUR OWN LIFESPAN IS
SHORTER THAN DINNER AND A MOVIE?

13:30.143 --> 13:33.981
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID
MISERABLE STAYS MISERABLE.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.316
YOU KEEP SAYING IT.
SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.885
I LOVE BEING BACK,

13:37.918 --> 13:39.920
HAVING EVERY THEORY
YOU AND I SHARE

13:39.953 --> 13:42.589
USED AS PROOF OF MY OWN
PERSONAL DAMAGE.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.598
I'M AFRAID WE'LL
NEED YOU TO STEP OUT

13:51.631 --> 13:52.900
WHEN THE EEG BEGINS.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.434
THE WAITING AREA'S
JUST DOWN THE HALL.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.369
I GOT TO CATCH AN EARLY TRAIN
IN THE MORNING ANYWAY.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.604
NO, DON'T.

13:57.637 --> 14:01.308
I'LL PUT YOU UP IN A NICE HOTEL,
OR RENT YOU A FURNISHED PLACE.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.644
I CAME FOR THE NIGHT 'CAUSE
I WANTED TO SEE HOW YOU WERE.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.180
MAYBE GET BACK
IN YOUR LIFE A BIT,

14:07.214 --> 14:08.415
BUT IF I TAKE YOUR MONEY...

14:08.448 --> 14:12.485
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
A NICE PLACE TO STAY?

14:12.519 --> 14:14.521
UNLESS OF COURSE...

14:14.554 --> 14:16.556
YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY.

14:18.591 --> 14:19.993
I GUESS I COULD KEEP
MY MOTEL ROOM

14:20.027 --> 14:21.895
ANOTHER NIGHT OR TWO.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.239
NEED A CONSULT.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.207
DID AN EEG ON MY PATIENT.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.176
TURNS OUT THE REASON
THAT PRIOR DOCTORS

14:36.209 --> 14:37.510
THOUGHT IT WASN'T
A NEURO PROBLEM

14:37.544 --> 14:39.913
IS BECAUSE IT'S
NOT A NEURO PROBLEM.

14:39.947 --> 14:43.483
THE EEG DID SHOW SIGNS
OF METABOLIC DISTRESS.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.185
WELL, SCAN HIS ABDOMEN.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.387
YEAH, LET'S ASSUME WE'D ALREADY
FIGURED THAT OUT ON OUR OWN,

14:47.420 --> 14:49.656
AND FOUND A MASS
ON THE PANCREAS.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.696
MASS LOOKS SOLID.
I'D SAY IT'S CANCER.

14:56.729 --> 14:57.630
PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROME

14:57.664 --> 14:59.499
WOULD EXPLAIN
THE NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS.

14:59.532 --> 15:00.500
YOU NEED TO GET
A PIECE OF IT.

15:00.533 --> 15:01.701
SCHEDULE A CT-GUIDED BIOPSY.

15:01.734 --> 15:06.974
YEAH, LET'S ASSUME WE'D ALREADY
FIGURED THAT OUT ON OUR OWN.

15:07.007 --> 15:10.944
THEN WHAT'S THIS CONSULT?

15:10.978 --> 15:12.512
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
BEEN YELLING AT ME

15:12.545 --> 15:15.715
ABOUT THE CUDDY TWINS?

15:15.748 --> 15:17.550
BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.087
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
THE SAME ISSUE?

15:20.120 --> 15:22.222
IS THERE SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

15:22.255 --> 15:24.157
THAT I'M RESPONDING
TO APPROPRIATELY?

15:24.191 --> 15:26.293
CUDDY WANTS YOU
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.660
SO DOES ARLENE.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.662
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT
TO FACE THEIR OWN PROBLEM.

15:29.696 --> 15:32.732
SOMEHOW, IN YOUR KNEE-JERK,
JUVENILE WAY,

15:32.765 --> 15:38.238
YOU TRIPPED AND FELL INTO AN
ACTUAL ADULT RESPONSE TO THIS.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.373
YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:44.611 --> 15:48.015
THAT WAS CUDDY'S
STRATEGY ALL ALONG.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.449
SHE WANTED ME TO THINK

15:49.482 --> 15:52.152
THAT SHE DESPERATELY
NEEDED ME TO BE THERE

15:52.185 --> 15:54.654
SO THAT I WOULDN'T BE THERE.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.363
WHERE IS DR. HOUSE?

16:03.396 --> 16:05.032
I DIDN'T WANT HIM HERE.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.634
THIS ISN'T ABOUT HER TREATMENT
AT PRINCETON-PLAINSBORO.

16:07.667 --> 16:11.171
IT'S ABOUT THE FIGHT
WE HAD LAST WEEK.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.772
I'D LIKE A MOMENT
WITH MY MOTHER

16:12.805 --> 16:15.442
TO TRY AND WORK THIS OUT
ON OUR OWN.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.510
I'M AFRAID MY CLIENT
DOESN'T WANT TO--

16:17.544 --> 16:19.012
IT'S MOTHER'S DAY SUNDAY.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.781
WE CAN'T HAVE FIVE MINUTES
ALONE TO FIX THIS?

16:21.814 --> 16:23.250
RELAX.
YOU CAN STILL BILL ME

16:23.283 --> 16:26.053
FOR THE TIME
STANDING IN THE HALLWAY.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.658
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD AT ME,

16:31.691 --> 16:33.726
BUT YOU CAN BARELY MAKE IT
UP THOSE STAIRS.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.096
HOW MANY NIGHTS HAVE YOU
SPENT ON YOUR COUCH?

16:36.129 --> 16:38.065
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH OUR FIGHT.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.667
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MY HOME,
NOT A PRISON CAMP.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.768
WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

16:41.801 --> 16:44.204
I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS NOT BEING PERSONAL.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.438
YOU CAN SPEND TIME
WITH RACHEL.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.806
I CAN WATCH OVER YOU.

16:46.839 --> 16:47.807
WIN, WIN.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.142
MAYBE I'VE GOT
A MEDICAL THING.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.677
MAYBE I JUST THINK
I'M TALKING,

16:50.710 --> 16:52.312
BUT NO ONE CAN HEAR ME,

16:52.345 --> 16:55.548
NOT JUST
MY UNCARING DAUGHTER.

16:55.582 --> 16:56.549
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:56.583 --> 16:57.717
20 GRAND.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.653
I'LL HIRE HELP AND FORGET
THIS NIGHTMARE YOU PUT ME THR--

17:00.687 --> 17:03.523
MAKE IT 30.
I'LL PUT IN A STAIR LIFT.

17:03.556 --> 17:07.460
IF MY BOARD EVEN HEARS
ABOUT THESE THREATS,

17:07.494 --> 17:08.728
LET ALONE A SETTLEMENT,

17:08.761 --> 17:10.130
THEY'LL INVESTIGATE
WHAT HAPPENED

17:10.163 --> 17:11.064
WHILE YOU WERE HERE
AS A PATIENT.

17:11.098 --> 17:15.602
HOUSE AND I COULD BOTH
LOSE OUR LICENSES.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.438
I'VE BEEN ASSUMING
THIS IS PERSONAL

17:18.471 --> 17:19.739
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO ASSUME

17:19.772 --> 17:22.409
THAT THAT'S WHAT
MY MOTHER WANTS.

17:25.212 --> 17:28.581
[door opens]

17:28.615 --> 17:29.716
HOUSE.

17:29.749 --> 17:30.850
EX-NOT-MOM-IN-LAW.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.385
YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T COMING.

17:32.419 --> 17:35.722
AFTER YOU SAID PRETTY PLEASE
WITH SUGAR ON TOP?

17:35.755 --> 17:37.457
PROBLEM IS WE ONLY
GIVE STORE CREDIT,

17:37.490 --> 17:41.328
SO I SAY WE PUT YOUR OLD,
CRACKED POISONOUS HIP BACK IN.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.562
HERE AND NOW.

17:42.595 --> 17:43.563
I SAVED YOUR LIFE.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.597
HAPPY TO UN-SAVE IT.

17:44.631 --> 17:45.832
HE IS BEING AN ASS.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.667
IF I COULD JOIN YOU
IN SUING HIM--

17:47.700 --> 17:49.502
SHE'S LIKE THIS
IN BED TOO.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.838
ALWAYS SCHEMING TO GET
THE LAWYERS OUT OF THE ROOM.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.444
IF HOUSE ISN'T GOING
TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY,

17:57.477 --> 18:00.347
I KNOW A FEW JUDGES
WHO WILL.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.287
WAS I SUPPOSED TO BE
THE GOOD COP?

18:09.222 --> 18:12.259
I HAD TO RIG THE MONITOR.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.827
I HAD A LOT OF SALT
WITH BREAKFAST.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.898
YOU THINK I'M REPRESSED TOO?

18:18.931 --> 18:21.168
I THINK YOU'RE IN DANGER
OF BEING DISSOLVED

18:21.201 --> 18:22.202
BY YOUR OWN STOMACH ACIDS.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.336
WELL, WHAT ABOUT CHASE?

18:23.370 --> 18:25.705
BELIEVE ALL THAT NONSENSE
ABOUT HIM BEING CELIBATE?

18:25.738 --> 18:27.774
DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'M ROOTING FOR HIM.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.476
READ THE STUDIES.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.144
THE FEWER PARTNERS YOU HAVE,

18:31.178 --> 18:33.846
THE HAPPIER YOU ARE
WITH YOUR ULTIMATE PARTNER.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.450
HMM. THEN YOU'RE
GONNA BE MISERABLE.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.685
THOSE STUDIES,

18:38.718 --> 18:41.921
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY
HAVE A CONTROL GROUP.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.758
THERE'S THE TUMOR
ON HIS PANCREAS.

18:45.792 --> 18:51.264
THERE'S ONE ON HIS KIDNEY
AND ONE IN HIS COLON.

18:51.298 --> 18:55.235
ONE LOOKS AVASCULAR,
ONE LOOKS VASCULAR.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.204
THE THIRD LOOKS CALCIFIED.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.839
HE HAS THREE COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT CANCERS AT ONCE.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.842
ON AVERAGE,
NOT SO LUCKY AFTER ALL.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.447
HAD TO GO ALL
WILE E. COYOTE ON ME.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.482
YOU TOLD ME THAT ARLENE
WANTED ME IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.518
I HAD TO SHOW HER THAT
NO GOOD WOULD COME OF THAT.

19:11.551 --> 19:15.888
SERIOUSLY?
THAT'S YOUR RATIONALIZATION?

19:15.922 --> 19:19.492
HOW ABOUT YOU DIDN'T LIKE
THAT CUDDY TRICKED YOU?

19:19.526 --> 19:21.461
EVEN THOUGH YOU WANTED
THE SAME THING AS HER.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.364
YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT SHE GOT
THE BEST OF YOU.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.466
YOU'VE GOT MORE ANGER
TOWARD HER THAN YOU REALIZE.

19:26.499 --> 19:30.403
I'M HAPPIER WITHOUT HER.

19:30.437 --> 19:34.374
I'M NOT STUPIDLY EXPECTING HER
TO MAKE ME HAPPY.

19:34.407 --> 19:37.210
I'M HAPPIER
WITH MY UNHAPPINESS.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.379
DO YOU LISTEN
TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

19:39.412 --> 19:40.413
BECAUSE I HAVE TO.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.915
I'M HOLDING A SUMMIT MEETING
TO FORCE YOU AND CUDDY

19:42.949 --> 19:45.618
ONTO THE SAME PAGE
BEFORE A LAWSUIT GETS FILED.

19:50.890 --> 19:54.461
(Taub)
THREE COMPLETELY
UNRELATED CANCERS AT ONCE.

19:54.494 --> 19:57.397
MULTI-CANCER SYNDROME--
VON HIPPEL LINDAU?

19:57.430 --> 19:59.466
WOULDN'T HAVE
TOUCHED HIS COLON.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.370
I HEREBY CERTIFY
THAT DR. FOREMAN

20:03.403 --> 20:05.972
HAS NOT TAMPERED WITH THIS
BLOOD PRESSURE MECHANISM

20:06.005 --> 20:07.374
IN ANY WAY.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.609
AND AFTER I PROVE
I'M 100% STRESS FREE,

20:09.642 --> 20:11.544
DO I GET TO STRAP YOU
INTO A CHASTITY BELT?

20:11.578 --> 20:13.446
(Thirteen)
WHAT IF THE PATIENT'S MISSING

20:13.480 --> 20:15.648
A TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR GENE?

20:15.682 --> 20:17.717
HOW WOULD WE EVEN FIND IT?

20:17.750 --> 20:19.419
WE NEED TO BLAST HIM
WITH CHEMO NOW.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.320
WE CAN'T GIVE THE PATIENT CHEMO.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.322
HIS PLATELET COUNT'S
THROUGH THE FLOOR.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.291
EVEN WORSE,
IT'D CONTAIN HIS CANCERS.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.758
IF WE WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON,

20:25.792 --> 20:27.560
WE GOT TO SEE
WHERE THEY SPREAD NEXT.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.562
YOU WANT TO WAIT SIX MONTHS
WHILE THE CANCER SPREADS

20:29.596 --> 20:30.897
AND HIS SEIZURES AND
PARALYSIS GET WORSE?

20:30.930 --> 20:32.432
WELL, NOW,
THAT'S CRAZY TALK.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.000
BUT IF WE PUMP THE PATIENT

20:34.033 --> 20:38.305
FULL OF VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL
GROWTH FACTOR...

20:38.338 --> 20:42.575
FOREMAN DOESN'T
LIKE THAT IDEA.

20:42.609 --> 20:46.613
[breathes heavily]

20:46.646 --> 20:50.617
YOU WANT TO GROW MORE
AND BIGGER CANCERS?

20:50.650 --> 20:53.019
WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT
THREE SMALL ONES HAVE IN COMMON,

20:53.052 --> 20:56.389
MAYBE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT
EIGHT BIG ONES HAVE IN COMMON?

20:59.058 --> 21:00.460
IS THIS IDEA REAL,

21:00.493 --> 21:02.462
OR ARE YOU JUST THREATENING
TO KILL THE PATIENT

21:02.495 --> 21:04.464
TO SCREW WITH ME?

21:08.568 --> 21:11.504
THIS WHOLE THING
IS IDIOTIC.

21:11.538 --> 21:12.572
WHAT DOES IT MATTER
WHAT'S INSIDE OF ME

21:12.605 --> 21:13.606
IF I KNOW
HOW TO CONTROL IT?

21:13.640 --> 21:14.974
MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO US,

21:15.007 --> 21:17.877
BUT YOU MAY WANT
TO MAKE OUT A WILL.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.079
GO GET LOTTO BOY'S CONSENT,

21:20.112 --> 21:22.649
AND TURN HIS CANCERS
UP TO 11.

21:30.690 --> 21:33.059
YOU, WHAT,
FOUND MY OLD YEARBOOK,

21:33.092 --> 21:35.495
AND GOT A PICTURE OF
MY HIGH SCHOOL BOYFRIEND?

21:35.528 --> 21:37.597
ACTUALLY, THAT WOULD
HAVE BEEN A LOT SIMPLER.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.966
NO, I TOOK THIS
TEN MINUTES AGO.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.505
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL BOYFRIEND
WHO DUMPED YOU,

21:45.538 --> 21:47.340
LEAVING YOU UNABLE TO BELIEVE

21:47.374 --> 21:49.376
THAT ANYONE CAN REKINDLE
AN OLD FLAME.

21:49.409 --> 21:52.779
HE DUMPED ME AFTER
I HOOKED UP WITH HIS SISTER.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.920
WOULD YOU MIND
LETTING HIM DOWN GENTLY?

22:00.953 --> 22:04.056
I MIGHT HAVE MADE PROMISES
YOU CAN'T KEEP.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.096
WE'RE GIVING YOU MORE CANCER.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.832
THE RISKS OF THAT
ARE KIND OF OBVIOUS.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.967
WE'LL SCAN YOU, RUN YOUR BLOOD
AT FREQUENT INTERVALS.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.469
WE BELIEVE
THIS IS OUR BEST CHANCE

22:16.503 --> 22:19.439
AT FINDING THE UNDERLYING
GENETIC FLAW.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.983
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

22:35.154 --> 22:36.656
DON'T BE STUPID.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.425
IF THIS CANCER
OVERWHELMS ME,

22:38.458 --> 22:40.927
AT LEAST I'LL DIE HAPPY
HERE AND NOW,

22:40.960 --> 22:42.695
INSTEAD OF HOPING
FOR A FUTURE

22:42.729 --> 22:45.532
I MAY NEVER HAVE.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.967
I LOVE YOU.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.902
NO, YOU DON'T.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.605
YOU DON'T KNOW.
YOU CAN'T KNOW.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.045
WE BOTH NEED MORE TIME.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.481
AND I BELIEVE
WE'RE GONNA HAVE IT.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.723
DO YOU NOTICE SHE'S WEARING
DIFFERENT CLOTHES EVERY DAY?

23:10.757 --> 23:13.526
AS OPPOSED TO THE SAME,
STARFLEET-ISSUED TUNIC?

23:13.560 --> 23:14.761
SHE SAID SHE CAME
FOR ONE NIGHT.

23:14.794 --> 23:15.795
WHY'D SHE PACK FOR MORE?

23:15.828 --> 23:17.664
SO SHE STUFFED AN EXTRA
SWEATSHIRT IN HER BAG,

23:17.697 --> 23:18.665
OR SHE BOUGHT SOMETHING.

23:18.698 --> 23:21.033
USED? SHE'S HERE BECAUSE
AN OLD BEAU STRUCK GOLD.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.802
SHE TURNED DOWN
A PROPOSAL.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.170
HOW LONG A GAME
YOU THINK SHE'S PLAYING?

23:24.203 --> 23:25.805
I THINK IF SHE SAID YES
AFTER 14 HOURS,

23:25.838 --> 23:26.773
EVEN HE'D BE SUSPICIOUS.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.008
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'RE HOT
AND SMART, BECAUSE--

23:29.041 --> 23:33.412
WELL, YOU'RE JUST LUCKY
YOU'RE HOT AND SMART.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.031
I NEED A HOOKER.

23:52.064 --> 23:55.702
NOT IF YOU CAN MAKE THAT WORK.

23:55.735 --> 23:58.605
HOW IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO RELAX YOU?

23:58.638 --> 24:00.773
IT'S NOT FOR ME.
IT'S FOR CHASE.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.074
I'M SAVING MYSELF TOO.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.510
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GET A COUPLE.

24:03.543 --> 24:05.144
YOU'RE RIDING ME.
WHY NOT RIDE HIM?

24:05.177 --> 24:07.480
BECAUSE I CAN GET A RISE
OUT OF YOUR BP.

24:07.514 --> 24:08.981
HIS PP ON THE OTHER HAND...

24:09.015 --> 24:11.751
FORGET YOGA.
EMBRACE ZEN.

24:11.784 --> 24:12.819
YOU'RE A REPRESSED IDIOT.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.153
HE'S A HORNY IDIOT.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.756
NEITHER ONE OF YOU
CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.925
PRETTY SURE THAT'S ZEN.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.866
[voices coming
from portable TV]

24:40.012 --> 24:41.981
THOUGHT WE WERE MEETING
IN CUDDY'S OFFICE.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.650
AND I PUT ONE OF
THE RADIO FREQUENCY

24:43.683 --> 24:44.984
TAGGED SPONGES
FROM THE O.R.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.953
IN YOUR
PORTABLE TELEVISION.

24:46.986 --> 24:47.887
HOWEVER MUCH IT HURT,

24:47.920 --> 24:49.088
I DID HAVE A RIGHT
TO BREAK UP WITH YOU.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.791
YOU JUST WANT EVERYTHING TO HAVE
A HIDDEN PERSONAL AGENDA.

24:51.824 --> 24:52.992
YOU NEED TO GET OVER IT

24:53.025 --> 24:54.761
INSTEAD OF TORPEDOING
OUR JOBS OUT OF SPITE.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.829
COULDN'T JUST BE THAT
YOU'RE A PAIN PROFESSIONALLY.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.598
STOP!

24:58.631 --> 24:59.899
YOU'RE BOTH AT FAULT HERE.

24:59.932 --> 25:02.001
YOU FOR TRYING
TO MANIPULATE HOUSE

25:02.034 --> 25:02.902
WHEN YOU USED TO KNOW BETTER,

25:02.935 --> 25:05.905
AND YOU FOR...
BEING YOU,

25:05.938 --> 25:08.074
WHICH AN ESPECIALLY BAD IDEA
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.676
I HAD GOOD REASONS.

25:09.709 --> 25:12.011
YOU HAD LAME
RATIONALIZATIONS.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.746
IF I HADN'T PLAYED HIM,

25:13.780 --> 25:15.815
HE'D HAVE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE
MEETING AND CRASHED IT ANYWAY.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.149
WOULD HAVE BEEN
A LOT MORE EFFICIENT.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.818
ENOUGH! OKAY,
HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.920
TOMORROW I DRIVE
BOTH OF YOU TO ARLENE'S.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.122
YOU'RE GONNA WRITE HER
A PERSONAL CHECK FOR $30,000,

25:23.155 --> 25:24.757
AND TELL HER SHE CAN STAY
IN HER OWN HOME

25:24.791 --> 25:25.758
WITH YOUR BLESSING.

25:25.792 --> 25:26.959
YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS

25:26.993 --> 25:28.795
BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY
GIVE A CRAP ABOUT YOUR JOB

25:28.828 --> 25:30.763
AND THIS HOSPITAL
AND YOUR MOTHER,

25:30.797 --> 25:32.999
AND POSSIBLY EVEN HOUSE.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.934
AND YOU'RE GONNA SAY,
"I'M SORRY,"

25:34.967 --> 25:36.836
AND NOT UTTER
ONE SYLLABLE MORE.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.337
BECAUSE I'M AN IDIOT?

25:38.370 --> 25:40.607
NO, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
I'M GONNA TELL THE PHARMACY

25:40.640 --> 25:42.609
TO STOP ISSUING VICODIN
PRESCRIPTIONS IN MY NAME.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.179
I'M NOT PAYING FOR GAS.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.354
ANYTHING LOOK DIFFERENT?

25:55.387 --> 25:57.056
NOT YET.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.090
WHERE'S JENNIFER?

25:58.124 --> 26:01.728
SHE'S EMBEZZLING MONEY
FROM MY SWISS BANK ACCOUNT.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.162
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK,
ISN'T IT?

26:03.195 --> 26:06.198
I'M BEING TAKEN FOR A RIDE?

26:06.232 --> 26:08.801
I THINK
SHE WOULDN'T BE HERE

26:08.835 --> 26:12.104
IF YOU WERE STILL
FIXING REFRIGERATORS.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.706
ONE RANDOM SET OF NUMBERS

26:13.740 --> 26:15.675
DOESN'T CHANGE HUMAN NATURE.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.811
THOSE SETS OF NUMBERS
ARE WHAT KEPT ME GOING.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.279
CLUTCHING THOSE TICKETS,

26:20.312 --> 26:23.115
THINKING ABOUT THE LIFE
I COULD HAVE,

26:23.149 --> 26:24.383
FINDING JENNIFER AGAIN.

26:24.416 --> 26:27.053
SO YOU FIGURE IF ONE
LONG-SHOT DREAM CAME TRUE

26:27.086 --> 26:29.055
THE OTHER ONE WILL AS WELL?

26:29.088 --> 26:32.625
YOU THINK
YOU'RE PROTECTING ME.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.727
I THINK YOU'RE SAD.

26:34.761 --> 26:38.130
CAN'T STAND TO SEE
SOMEBODY HAPPY.

26:38.164 --> 26:40.833
[doorbell rings]

26:45.705 --> 26:48.140
MOM, HERE'S A CHECK.

26:48.174 --> 26:50.843
IT'S A SETTLEMENT
FOR ALL YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.044
OF COURSE YOU CAN
STAY IN YOUR HOME.

26:52.078 --> 26:54.080
IT WAS WRONG OF ME
TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.919
I'M SORRY.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.088
THAT WE SAVED YOUR LIFE.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.293
IN THE WAY THAT WE DID.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.095
B-PLUS.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.230
I HOPE THIS
RESOLVES EVERYTHING.

27:11.263 --> 27:14.133
I CAN TELL YOU THAT BOTH
YOUR DAUGHTER AND DR. HOUSE--

27:14.166 --> 27:16.102
THIS IS 30 GRAND.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.737
WHICH IS WHAT
YOU ASKED FOR.

27:17.770 --> 27:19.071
THIS COVERS
PAIN AND SUFFERING.

27:19.105 --> 27:22.241
WHAT ABOUT
THE PROBATE LAWYER?

27:22.274 --> 27:23.242
DO YOU TWO...

27:23.275 --> 27:25.344
I HAVE TO CHANGE MY WILL,

27:25.377 --> 27:26.746
LEAVE EVERYTHING TO JULIA

27:26.779 --> 27:29.048
SO THIS ONE DOESN'T TRY
MORE FUNNY BUSINESS

27:29.081 --> 27:30.216
TO GET CONTROL OF MY HOME.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.819
I'M SURE WE CAN TOSS IN
ANOTHER 2,500.

27:32.852 --> 27:35.121
WELL, I GUESS I'LL HAVE
TO KILL YOU TONIGHT THEN.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.056
MOM,
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN--

27:37.089 --> 27:38.991
YOU ALREADY THINK
YOU OWN MY BODY.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.927
WHY NOT MY HOME TOO?

27:40.960 --> 27:42.061
EVERYBODY STAY CALM, AND--

27:42.094 --> 27:44.396
YOU HAVE TO LASH OUT AT
EVERYONE WHO TRIES TO HELP YOU?

27:44.430 --> 27:47.066
LIVE IN YOUR OWN KITCHEN SINK
FOR ALL I CARE.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.167
HARSH.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.836
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU HAD A CASE BEFORE,

27:49.869 --> 27:52.138
BUT THAT IS NO WAY
TO TALK TO A PATIENT.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.974
(Arlene)
YOU ARE RIGHT.

28:06.485 --> 28:09.221
CHASE HAS HAD HIS EYES
ON THIS ONE FOR MONTHS.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.991
(Taub)
MEANING HE HAS EYES?

28:12.024 --> 28:13.425
I PAID HER 100 BUCKS.

28:13.459 --> 28:14.326
WHEN HE HITS ON HER--

28:14.360 --> 28:16.262
MIGHT BE TONIGHT,
MIGHT BE NEXT WEEK--

28:16.295 --> 28:18.831
SHE'S GONNA SLAP HIM
AND STORM OFF.

28:18.865 --> 28:21.868
SO YOUR PLAN IS TO PROVE
YOU'RE BOTH FULL OF CRAP

28:21.901 --> 28:23.069
ALL IN ONE MOVE?

28:23.102 --> 28:24.971
FIRST HE'LL
COMPLIMENT HER HAIR.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.172
THAT'S HOW HE BREAKS THE ICE.

28:26.205 --> 28:30.977
NEXT COMES SOME KIND OF
JOKE OR STORY.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.211
HE'S SHARPENING HIS HARPOON.

28:32.244 --> 28:35.347
ARE MY MOVES
THIS PREDICTABLE?

28:35.381 --> 28:38.184
SHE'S GRABBING HIS ARM.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.019
HE'S GOING IN
FOR THE KILL.

29:07.479 --> 29:09.748
DON'T LET IT
GET TO YOU.

29:14.086 --> 29:17.156
(Taub)
POURED A LOT OF GAS
ON THE FIRE.

29:17.189 --> 29:19.091
ULTRASOUND WILL GIVE US
A GOOD LOOK AT THE DAMAGE.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.526
LITTLE MORE GEL.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.061
I NEVER MADE A WILL.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.863
I WANT TO PROVIDE FOR YOU,
IF I DON'T--

29:23.896 --> 29:25.231
STOP IT, WILL YOU?

29:25.264 --> 29:27.266
LIKE YOU TO HOLD
YOUR BREATH FOR A SEC.

29:27.299 --> 29:30.937
YOUR MONEY,
THERE'S CHARITIES, CAUSES.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.304
YOUR FAMILY.

29:32.338 --> 29:35.975
YOU GOT TO ASK YOURSELF
WHAT'S MATTERED TO YOU MOST

29:36.008 --> 29:37.276
YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.849
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.884
IS IT BAD NEWS?

29:44.917 --> 29:46.352
NO.

29:46.385 --> 29:49.588
WE'VE BEEN PUMPING YOU
WITH GROWTH FACTOR,

29:49.621 --> 29:52.925
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY NEW CANCERS.

29:52.959 --> 29:57.263
THE TUMORS YOU HAD
ALL SHRANK.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.969
THREE TUMORS DISAPPEARING
MEANS WE WERE PROBABLY WRONG

30:03.002 --> 30:05.104
ABOUT HIM MISSING
A TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR GENE.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.906
HOW MANY MULLIGANS
ARE YOU GONNA ASK FOR?

30:06.939 --> 30:11.110
THIS TEST IS WHAT RAISED
MY BLOOD PRESSURE.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.512
I'M USED TO IT NOW.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.915
GO.

30:15.948 --> 30:16.916
[computer beeps]

30:16.949 --> 30:17.917
IF IT'S AUTOIMMUNE

30:17.950 --> 30:19.251
AND HE CREATED ANTIBODIES

30:19.285 --> 30:21.187
THAT ENDED UP
FIGHTING HIS OWN TUMORS...

30:21.220 --> 30:22.388
GROWTH FACTOR
WOULD HAVE MADE

30:22.421 --> 30:24.223
THE UNDERLYING AUTOIMMUNE
CONDITION BETTER.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.992
MAYBE IT WAS NEVER CANCER
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

30:26.025 --> 30:29.395
OF COURSE IT WAS CANCER.
WE BIOPSIED.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.597
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A FALSE POSITIVE.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.365
AMYLOIDOSIS?

30:33.399 --> 30:37.069
HIS EKG VOLTAGE HAS BEEN
ON THE LOW END OF NORMAL.

30:37.103 --> 30:39.505
WHAT IF THE TUMORS WERE ACTUALLY
PROTEIN DEPOSITS?

30:39.538 --> 30:42.875
G.I. BIOPSY TO CONFIRM,
CHEMO TO TREAT.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.343
SHE'S MAKING THAT DIAGNOSIS

30:44.376 --> 30:46.178
BASED OFF OF LOW-NORMAL EKG.

30:46.212 --> 30:50.416
LOW-NORMAL IS STILL NORMAL.

30:50.449 --> 30:51.984
THAT THING CANNOT BE RIGHT.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.285
LOW-NORMAL IS STILL LOW,

30:53.319 --> 30:54.620
AND THAT THING
DOES NOT HAVE MONEY

30:54.653 --> 30:55.922
RIDING ON YOU BEING WRONG,

30:55.955 --> 30:56.923
LIKE THE REST OF US DO.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.157
CHASE FIXED THIS.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.992
OH, I THINK YOU'RE CONFUSING
CHASE AND FOREMAN.

31:00.026 --> 31:02.328
I USED TO DO THAT
ALL THE TIME.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.595
I KNOW IT'S RIGGED.

31:03.629 --> 31:04.596
BECAUSE YOU'RE MR. COOL?

31:04.630 --> 31:06.332
NOTHING COULD
POSSIBLY FAZE--

31:06.365 --> 31:07.633
BECAUSE I TOOK
A BETA BLOCKER!

31:18.377 --> 31:22.181
BOTH TIMES, RIGHT?

31:22.214 --> 31:24.050
HIS PLATELET COUNT'S
STILL LOW.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.351
CHEMO'S STILL
A DEATH SENTENCE.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.319
TREATING FOR AMYLOID
WITH NORMAL EKG

31:27.353 --> 31:28.654
IS LIKE DOING
HEART SURGERY ON A GUY

31:28.687 --> 31:30.322
BECAUSE HE'S
TEN POUNDS OVERWEIGHT.

31:30.356 --> 31:32.058
IT'S INSANE.
WELL,
WE'LL DO IT YOUR WAY--

31:32.091 --> 31:33.993
GO SHOUT AT THE PATIENT
TILL HE GETS BETTER.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.395
G.I. BIOPSY TO CONFIRM,
CHEMO TO TREAT.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.006
HERE'S THE DIRTY
LITTLE SECRET.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.540
I JUST THINK
WE ARE WHO WE ARE.

31:48.574 --> 31:51.177
AND I THINK
LOTTERIES ARE STUPID.

31:52.711 --> 31:55.347
JANET...HEMORRHOID?

31:59.485 --> 32:03.722
THAT'S NOT MY NAME.
IT'S WHY I'M HERE.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.058
OH, I SEE.
IT GOES ACROSS.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.326
WE BETTER MAKE THIS FAST,

32:07.359 --> 32:08.127
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT TO LOSE

32:08.160 --> 32:10.029
MY MEDICAL LICENSE
FOR MALPRACTICE.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.130
IT'S NOTHING UNUSUAL.

32:11.163 --> 32:14.466
THE HEAD OF THE HOSPITAL'S
ABOUT TO LOSE HERS TOO.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.077
I HEARD CUDDY QUADRUPLED
YOUR CLINIC HOURS.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.078
YEAH,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:26.112 --> 32:27.379
I'M FLYING THROUGH PATIENTS.

32:27.413 --> 32:28.614
ARLENE WANTS
ANOTHER MEETING.

32:28.647 --> 32:31.317
I KNOW. TOLD MY SECONDS
TO TELL HER SECONDS

32:31.350 --> 32:33.319
THAT SHE GETS
NO SECOND CHANCE.

32:33.352 --> 32:34.720
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
IT'S A THIRD CHANCE,

32:34.753 --> 32:35.721
BUT I DON'T HAVE THIRDS.

32:35.754 --> 32:37.589
CUDDY TOLD HER THE SAME THING,
MORE OR LESS.

32:37.623 --> 32:40.159
SO YOU GOT US ON
THE SAME PAGE AFTER ALL.

32:40.192 --> 32:42.061
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOUR IRRATIONALITY,

32:42.094 --> 32:43.695
AND I'VE COME UP WITH A RATIONAL
EXPLANATION FOR IT.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.197
THAT'S QUITE A CHALLENGE.

32:45.231 --> 32:46.999
YOU DON'T WANT
TO LET GO OF CUDDY,

32:47.033 --> 32:49.168
SO YOU'RE CLINGING
TO THE NEGATIVE INTERACTION,

32:49.201 --> 32:50.736
BECAUSE SOME SMALL PART OF YOU

32:50.769 --> 32:53.272
THINKS THE BAD STUFF
BEATS NOTHING AT ALL.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.307
YOU'RE ALMOST
MAKING THIS WORK.

32:55.341 --> 32:58.410
ALL YOU GOT TO DO NOW
IS CHANGE REALITY.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.179
PERHAPS IF I WAS
THE ONE SUING ME.

33:00.212 --> 33:01.247
YOU DIDN'T START IT,

33:01.280 --> 33:03.315
BUT YOU HAD THE CHANCE
TO END IT, AND YOU DIDN'T.

33:03.349 --> 33:05.117
YOU LOVE HER, HOUSE,

33:05.151 --> 33:06.385
AND IT'S HUMAN TO HANG ON,

33:06.418 --> 33:08.587
BUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP
NOT JUST YOUR JOB

33:08.620 --> 33:12.591
BUT ANY CHANCE OF ANY KIND
OF RELATIONSHIP WITH HER AGAIN.

33:22.268 --> 33:24.370
HI.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.644
WHAT'S THAT?

33:32.678 --> 33:34.380
IT'S A CHECK.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.615
FOR $10 MILLION.

33:45.224 --> 33:49.795
UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, I MEAN...

33:49.828 --> 33:51.797
YOU ALREADY BEEN
SO GENEROUS.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.799
BY HIRING YOU?

33:53.832 --> 33:54.766
YEAH.

33:54.800 --> 33:58.504
FOR A WHOPPING SIX FIGURES?
MY OWN BLOOD?

33:58.537 --> 34:01.507
BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD?

34:01.540 --> 34:05.377
YEAR IN, YEAR OUT.

34:35.807 --> 34:39.478
YOU'RE WEARING CONTACTS
UNDER YOUR GLASSES?

34:39.511 --> 34:41.713
I MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN
TO TAKE THEM OFF WHEN I--

34:41.747 --> 34:42.714
THEY'RE TINTED.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.616
DO YOU CHANGE
YOUR EYE COLOR?

34:44.650 --> 34:48.854
SOMETIMES I LIKE
TO MIX IT UP.

34:48.887 --> 34:50.289
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT ARE YOU...

34:50.322 --> 34:54.726
WAIT, YOU--
YOU DON'T HAVE BROWN EYES?

35:00.732 --> 35:05.604
WHERE'D THE NAME
BABY BEAR COME FROM?

35:05.637 --> 35:07.439
IT'S SO LONG AGO,
I DON'T...

35:07.473 --> 35:10.309
IT'S A BIRTHMARK
ON YOUR LEFT BREAST

35:10.342 --> 35:12.411
IN THE SHAPE OF A BEAR.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.680
YOU FORGOT THAT?

35:20.486 --> 35:22.321
IT'S THE ONE THING
I NEVER TOLD YOU.

35:22.354 --> 35:26.425
THAT'S WHY
SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.528
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.
I SWEAR.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.766
GET OUT.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.468
GET OUT, BOTH OF YOU.

35:36.502 --> 35:38.504
COME ON, MAN.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.206
GET OUT.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.473
I'M SORRY.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.175
GET OUT!

35:43.209 --> 35:46.312
BOTH OF YOU!

35:51.950 --> 35:53.819
YOU WERE RIGHT.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.922
I'M JUST ANOTHER
LOTTERY FOOL.

35:56.955 --> 36:01.627
MY LIFE SUCKS.
IT'LL ALWAYS SUCK.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.628
[device beeping]

36:02.661 --> 36:03.629
(Taub)
HE'S CRASHING.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.365
EVERYTHING'S SHUTTING DOWN.

36:06.398 --> 36:08.434
[beeping continues]

36:11.737 --> 36:12.971
(Thirteen)
PATIENT HAD
A CARDIAC ARREST,

36:13.004 --> 36:14.373
AND HIS LUNGS
AND LIVER FAILED

36:14.406 --> 36:16.675
BEFORE WE EVEN
STARTED THE CHEMO.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.610
(Chase)
BRAIN SYMPTOMS THAT
AREN'T BRAIN SYMPTOMS,

36:18.644 --> 36:20.579
TUMORS THAT COME AND GO?

36:20.612 --> 36:21.780
(Foreman)
IT'S NOT AMYLOIDOSIS.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.550
YOU'RE FORGETTING ALOPECIA.

36:24.583 --> 36:25.617
OH, I'M SORRY.

36:25.651 --> 36:26.552
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST

36:26.585 --> 36:28.820
LISTING THE THINGS IT'S NOT,
ALPHABETICALLY.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.689
HIS LONG LOST LOVE
IS A FRAUD.

36:30.722 --> 36:31.757
THIRTEEN FIGURED THAT OUT.

36:31.790 --> 36:32.758
GOOD FOR HER.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.226
DECADES OF MENIAL WORK,

36:34.260 --> 36:36.695
THREE CANCERS COULDN'T
MAKE HIM DIE MISERABLE.

36:36.728 --> 36:37.696
SHE JUST DID.

36:37.729 --> 36:39.398
THE TRUTH
MADE HIM MISERABLE.

36:39.431 --> 36:42.701
IT'S LIKE
THERE'S TWO OF ME.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.636
[alarm blaring]

36:44.670 --> 36:47.239
KEEP THE CLINIC SHUT DOWN.

36:47.273 --> 36:48.374
BUT WHEREVER IT IS,

36:48.407 --> 36:49.975
IT'S ISOLATED TO THE
ADMINISTRATIVE FLOOR.

36:50.008 --> 36:52.778
I'M NOT GONNA
EVACUATE THE WHOLE...

36:59.618 --> 37:01.487
ONLY WAY TO GET
THE TWO OF YOU

37:01.520 --> 37:03.989
IN THE SAME PLACE
AT THE SAME TIME.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.727
REOPEN EVERYTHING.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.996
READMIT EVERYONE. NOW.

37:11.029 --> 37:14.266
I WANT YOU BOTH TO KNOW
I'M FILING THE SUIT TODAY,

37:14.300 --> 37:16.735
DELIVERING THE PAPERWORK
TO YOUR COUNSEL'S OFFICE.

37:16.768 --> 37:17.836
YOU HAVE TO BE DESTRUCTIVE.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.438
YOU HAVE TO TEAR THINGS APART.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.772
GOD FORBID YOU SHOULD SAY

37:20.806 --> 37:22.841
WHAT'S REALLY ON
THAT TWISTED MIND OF YOURS?

37:22.874 --> 37:24.543
AND YOU'RE THE GREAT
PEACEMAKER?

37:24.576 --> 37:27.779
SINGLE MOM, CAN'T KEEP A MAN
LONG ENOUGH TO COOK A MEAL.

37:27.813 --> 37:31.717
YOU'D BE DEAD IF IT WEREN'T
FOR OUR MISTREATMENT.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.685
AND SOMEHOW YOU'D STILL FIND
SOMETHING TO WHINE ABOUT.

37:33.719 --> 37:35.687
WE'LL LET THE COURT
DECIDE WHO'S WHINING,

37:35.721 --> 37:36.955
SINCE YOU'RE SO SURE--

37:36.988 --> 37:39.891
WE'RE NOT GETTING
BACK TOGETHER.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.561
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:42.594 --> 37:44.663
IT'S THE ONLY EXPLANATION.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.332
WHY SHE KEEPS MAKING THREATS

37:46.365 --> 37:50.536
WITHOUT EVER FILING HER STUPID,
YET COMPLETELY VALID LAWSUIT.

37:50.569 --> 37:51.603
WHY SHE RIPPED UP HER WILL,

37:51.637 --> 37:54.506
WHY SHE KICKED HALF
THE HOSPITAL OUT ON THE STREET.

37:54.540 --> 37:57.476
SHE WANTS US UNITED
AGAINST HER.

37:57.509 --> 38:00.646
THIS IS HER DRAWING BLOOD

38:00.679 --> 38:03.682
OVER THE LATEST OF A LONG LINE
OF IMAGINARY SLIGHTS.

38:03.715 --> 38:07.786
SHE DOESN'T CARE IF ANYONE
ELSE IS HAPPY FOR A SINGLE--

38:11.557 --> 38:14.693
LOOK AT YOU IDIOTS.

38:14.726 --> 38:17.028
WHO ELSE IS GONNA PUT UP
WITH EITHER OF YOU?

38:21.500 --> 38:24.803
I ASKED YOU TO MOVE IN.

38:24.836 --> 38:28.907
THAT MEANT WE WEREN'T
GONNA RECONCILE.

38:31.710 --> 38:35.614
I'M SORRY, MOM.

38:35.647 --> 38:41.753
SOME THINGS TAKE MORE
THAN A COMMON ENEMY.

38:41.787 --> 38:45.524
THEN YOU'RE AN IDIOT
WITH IMPOSSIBLE STANDARDS.

39:00.672 --> 39:03.675
COMMON ENEMY.

39:03.709 --> 39:05.777
ONE WAY TO TRIGGER
BRAIN SYMPTOMS

39:05.811 --> 39:07.779
WHEN THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH YOUR BRAIN

39:07.813 --> 39:10.816
HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TURN
YOUR BRAIN INTO A COMMON ENEMY.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.651
YOU HAVE A TERATOMA,

39:12.684 --> 39:15.854
A USUALLY HARMLESS
CONGENITAL GROWTH

39:15.887 --> 39:18.690
WHICH CAN BE FILLED WITH
ALMOST ANY KIND OF TISSUE.

39:18.724 --> 39:21.627
AND, UNUSUALLY,
NOT AT ALL HARMLESS.

39:21.660 --> 39:24.696
IF I'M RIGHT, YOURS IS FILLED
WITH PRIMITIVE CELLS,

39:24.730 --> 39:27.032
SOME OF WHICH DEVELOPED
INTO BRAIN CELLS.

39:27.065 --> 39:30.001
THESE FOREIGN CELLS
LEAKED INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM.

39:30.035 --> 39:33.038
NOW, THE BODY
IS A LITTLE XENOPHOBIC.

39:33.071 --> 39:34.806
IT CREATES ANTIBODIES.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.442
THE PROBLEM IS,
THERE'S NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE

39:36.475 --> 39:37.676
BETWEEN BRAIN CELLS
IN YOUR ABDOMEN

39:37.709 --> 39:39.177
AND BRAIN CELLS IN YOUR BRAIN.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.846
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,

39:40.879 --> 39:44.416
PRIMITIVE CELLS CAN BECOME
ALMOST ANYTHING.

39:44.450 --> 39:45.617
GROW LIKE WEEDS.

39:45.651 --> 39:48.153
WHICH MEANS THEY
CAN TURN INTO TUMORS,

39:48.186 --> 39:53.459
DESTROY WHOLE ORGAN SYSTEMS.

39:53.492 --> 39:54.693
BUT THE CANCER?

39:54.726 --> 39:56.127
WAS CANCER.

39:56.161 --> 39:59.197
JUST GROWING SO FAST IT
COLLAPSED UNDER ITS OWN WEIGHT.

39:59.230 --> 40:02.501
AM I GONNA LIVE?

40:02.534 --> 40:05.637
CUT OUT THE TERATOMA,
WHAT'S LEFT OF YOUR CANCER,

40:05.671 --> 40:07.839
YOU SHOULD BE FINE.

40:07.873 --> 40:10.776
THINK OF IT AS
YOUR SECOND LUCKIEST DAY.

40:10.809 --> 40:12.878
IT'S HARD TO FEEL LUCKY.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.614
THE WOMAN I LOVE
WAS A FRAUD.

40:15.647 --> 40:19.084
NO, ACTUALLY A FRAUD
WAS A FRAUD.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.887
YOU FELL FOR HER
JUST THE SAME.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.689
YOU MAY STAY MISERABLE,

40:23.722 --> 40:26.057
BUT YOUR LONG LOST LOVE
IS NOT GONNA BE THE REASON WHY.

40:26.091 --> 40:33.198
*

40:51.583 --> 40:54.586
* LADY, DON'T
THROW IN THE TOWEL *

40:54.620 --> 40:57.623
* LET ME DRY YOU OFF
I'LL SHOWER *

40:57.656 --> 41:00.659
* YOU USED TO BE
MY LITTLE SICKLING *

41:00.692 --> 41:05.230
* BUT NOW IT'S ME
THAT NEEDS SOME FIXING *

41:16.274 --> 41:19.210
* I THINK ABOUT YOU
EVERY SECOND *

41:19.244 --> 41:22.648
* ALONG WITH THE PAIN THAT'S
THROUGH YOU, RECKON *

41:22.681 --> 41:25.817
* YOU USED TO BE
MY LITTLE SICKLING *

41:25.851 --> 41:29.120
* BUT NOW IT'S ME THAT
NEEDS SOME FIXIN' *

41:29.154 --> 41:34.660
*

41:34.693 --> 41:38.196
* WHAT IS IT
ABOUT THE TIME AND *

41:38.229 --> 41:41.066
* WHAT IS IT ABOUT
THE PLACE AND *

41:41.099 --> 41:45.236
* WHAT IS IT
ABOUT YOUR FACE *

41:45.270 --> 41:47.172
* THAT KEEPS ME ON THE LINE

41:47.205 --> 41:53.979
*

41:56.682 --> 41:59.651
IT'S THE REAL JENNIFER.

41:59.685 --> 42:00.919
OR AT LEAST
THE ONLY ONE TO SHOW UP

42:00.952 --> 42:02.921
WHO ACTUALLY HAS
THE BIRTHMARK.

42:02.954 --> 42:06.658
HE'S RENTING HER
AN APARTMENT.

42:06.692 --> 42:08.226
IT'LL END HORRIBLY.

42:08.259 --> 42:10.996
NOT FOR HIM.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.331
SHE MAY TAKE ALL HIS MONEY,

42:13.364 --> 42:16.668
AND HE MAY BE A NAIVE IDIOT,
BUT...

42:16.702 --> 42:18.169
HE'LL ALWAYS BE HOPEFUL,

42:18.203 --> 42:23.942
SO HE'LL ALWAYS BE HAPPY.

42:23.975 --> 42:25.977
YOU LOST YOUR MOTHER.

42:26.011 --> 42:27.846
YOU EUTHANIZED
YOUR BROTHER.

42:27.879 --> 42:32.017
YOU GOT THE LIFE EXPECTANCY
OF A PRETTY GOOD SITCOM.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.719
IF YOU CAN CONVINCE YOURSELF

42:33.752 --> 42:34.986
THAT YOU'D BE MISERABLE
NO MATTER WHAT

42:35.020 --> 42:36.221
EVEN WITHOUT ALL THAT STUFF,

42:36.254 --> 42:39.658
THEN MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE
TO HATE THE UNIVERSE

42:39.691 --> 42:43.895
FOR DUMPING
A GIANT TURD ON YOU.

42:43.929 --> 42:49.067
FATALISM IS YOUR
SURVIVAL MECHANISM.

42:49.100 --> 42:52.170
AND YOU?

42:52.203 --> 42:54.239
DUMPED BY EVERYONE
YOU'VE EVER LOVED.

42:54.272 --> 42:55.373
REHAB WAS A BUST.

42:55.406 --> 42:59.044
YOUR LEG FEELS LIKE SOMEBODY
TOOK A GIANT BITE OUT OF IT.

43:01.813 --> 43:04.883
WE ARE WHO WE ARE.

43:04.916 --> 43:06.852
LOTTERIES ARE STUPID.

43:10.756 --> 43:13.759
