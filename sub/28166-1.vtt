- Woo-hoo!
- Blair, Amber!

35:10.978 --> 35:12.197
- That was so cool.
- Yeah [laughing]!

35:12.284 --> 35:13.676
- What'’re you guys doing here?

35:13.763 --> 35:14.851
- Just be more careful

35:14.938 --> 35:16.810
about what you post on Twitter,
bud!

35:16.897 --> 35:19.595
[Blair and Amber laughing]

35:19.682 --> 35:22.250
- Look at the picture
[laughing].

35:22.337 --> 35:24.470
Look, I just set this to
Jackson.

35:25.471 --> 35:26.863
- Be nice.

35:26.950 --> 35:27.516
- [Pete] Guys, come on.

35:27.603 --> 35:28.865
Picture time!

35:28.952 --> 35:30.084
[camera shutter clicking]
- Since when?

35:30.171 --> 35:31.564
- It'’s really not that freaky.

35:31.651 --> 35:33.653
It'’s just a bunch of rocks.

35:33.740 --> 35:36.003
- Yeah, someone blew it
up a couple years ago.

35:36.090 --> 35:37.265
I heard there were some remnants

35:37.352 --> 35:38.788
of an old log cabin Mr. Kay
built.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.138
Wanna go check it out?

35:40.225 --> 35:42.314
- Is it better than this?
- I wanna see!

35:42.401 --> 35:43.663
- [Dylan] You guys can go ahead.

35:43.750 --> 35:44.968
I'’ll wait here.

35:45.055 --> 35:47.580
- All right.
- Yeah, I'’m kinda done.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.190
I'’ll just stay here too,

35:49.277 --> 35:50.409
I that'’s all right.
- Oh, look!

35:50.496 --> 35:52.019
- It'’s okay if you're scared.

35:52.106 --> 35:53.629
Blair will protect you.

35:53.716 --> 35:54.761
- Come on, ladies!

35:56.937 --> 35:58.286
Come on, ladies.

35:58.373 --> 35:59.853
Move those thighs!

35:59.940 --> 36:00.854
- What a dork.
- '’Cause you're not

36:00.941 --> 36:02.203
getting any younger.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.030
- Hey.

36:05.119 --> 36:05.902
- Hi.

36:10.777 --> 36:11.995
So, iFly?

36:13.388 --> 36:15.390
- Yeah, I just came from work.

36:17.784 --> 36:20.221
- You don'’t work at the music
store?

36:20.308 --> 36:22.397
- No, you'’d think so, but no.

36:25.313 --> 36:26.793
- What'’s iFly, then?

36:26.880 --> 36:28.360
- Indoor skydiving.

36:28.447 --> 36:29.883
- Huh, that'’s pretty cool.
- Yeah, it'’s fun.

36:31.406 --> 36:34.453
- [Sam] Do you even
know where you'’re going?

36:34.540 --> 36:35.715
- [Pete] Sorry, it'’s this way!

36:35.802 --> 36:36.585
Yeah, trust me.

36:36.672 --> 36:38.152
I know what I'’m doing.

36:38.239 --> 36:39.371
- So, how did PD,
- It'’s gonna be the best thing

36:39.458 --> 36:41.068
you'’ve ever seen.
- How did Pete

36:41.155 --> 36:43.462
convince you to come?
- He didn'’t.

36:44.637 --> 36:45.855
I'’m a hostage.
- Ooh.

36:47.074 --> 36:50.425
- He wants to complete this
list,

36:50.512 --> 36:51.905
an adventure list my parents
wrote

36:51.992 --> 36:52.775
when they were our age.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.647
- Ooh!
- Alex, too.

36:54.734 --> 36:56.475
- Oh!
- Yeah.

36:56.562 --> 36:58.868
I guess they were friends in
high school.

36:58.955 --> 36:59.956
- That'’s really cool.

37:01.567 --> 37:02.872
So, what does your dad think
about it?

37:02.959 --> 37:04.047
- He doesn'’t even know that
we'’re here.

37:04.134 --> 37:05.745
- No, sorry.
- And I don'’t think

37:05.832 --> 37:06.615
- It'’s this way, trust me.
- He'’d like it that much.

37:06.702 --> 37:07.790
- Trust me.
- I swear,

37:07.877 --> 37:09.966
I'’m gonna punch you in the face.

37:10.053 --> 37:10.837
- And your mom?

37:12.273 --> 37:15.450
- She died, three years, cancer.

37:15.537 --> 37:17.626
- I'’m sorry.
- It'’s okay.

37:18.888 --> 37:20.499
She would'’ve loved this.

37:21.848 --> 37:23.371
- Oh, shoot!
- It'’s kinda who she was

37:23.458 --> 37:25.504
before she got sick.

37:25.591 --> 37:26.896
[dog barking]
- We'’ve been blown!

37:26.983 --> 37:27.941
Abort, abort!
- Yeah, we should

37:28.028 --> 37:28.811
probably go.
- Hey, I see you!

37:28.898 --> 37:29.595
- [Pete] Get a move on!

37:29.682 --> 37:30.857
No time for kissing.

37:30.944 --> 37:33.468
Come on!
- This is private property!

37:33.555 --> 37:35.688
Police are on the way.

37:35.775 --> 37:39.039
Get outta here!
[girls laughing]

37:40.388 --> 37:44.392
- I think that if Blair is cool
with it,

37:44.479 --> 37:46.176
we should just do it.
- No way.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.177
[door slamming]
I am done.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.048
- [Sam] You loved it.

37:50.616 --> 37:51.356
- Dad?

37:52.966 --> 37:55.185
- I thought you two were
going to the movies.

37:56.622 --> 37:57.797
- We changed our minds.

37:58.841 --> 37:59.625
- Oh?

38:01.235 --> 38:03.368
Well, do you have any idea what
it'’s like

38:03.455 --> 38:04.934
to get a call from the cops

38:05.021 --> 38:06.458
saying that he just chased your
kids

38:06.545 --> 38:07.850
off of private property?

38:09.983 --> 38:12.028
I thought, not my kids.

38:13.639 --> 38:14.770
Then I saw this.

38:22.474 --> 38:23.257
- So what?

38:24.650 --> 38:26.913
Are we in trouble?

38:27.000 --> 38:30.917
- With Kyle, no, but next time,

38:31.004 --> 38:32.919
Old Man Johnson is gonna press
charges.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.574
Was this your idea?

38:35.661 --> 38:37.489
- It'’s not her fault.
- Dylan, stop.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.360
- Yeah, Dylan, stop.

38:40.709 --> 38:42.058
It'’s never your idea.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.497
When is enough gonna be enough,
Sam?

38:45.584 --> 38:46.628
- Dad, it wasn'’t my fault.
- When are you gonna stop

38:46.715 --> 38:48.064
being the bad kid?
- Dad!

38:48.151 --> 38:49.239
Leave her alone.
- That'’s one of the reasons

38:49.327 --> 38:50.632
why we moved here in the first
place.

38:50.719 --> 38:51.546
You'’re both better than this.

38:51.633 --> 38:52.417
- [Dylan] How do you know

38:52.504 --> 38:53.548
who we are?
- Stop!

38:53.635 --> 38:55.028
- [Dylan] You are never around.

38:55.115 --> 38:58.292
- Do you have any idea how late
it is?

38:58.379 --> 39:01.339
Do you want the neighbors
to hear everything?

39:01.426 --> 39:02.775
- [Jonathan] Look, we'’re sorry,
Norah.

39:03.819 --> 39:07.170
[loud knocking]

39:07.257 --> 39:08.476
- [Dylan] It'’s not true.

39:09.825 --> 39:11.349
You'’re not a bad kid.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.742
- Just leave me alone, please.

39:13.829 --> 39:14.961
- [Dylan] Hey, open up.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.142
- [Sam] What?

39:23.926 --> 39:25.493
- Do you know, I realized
tonight

39:26.929 --> 39:28.540
mom would have loved that place.

39:29.802 --> 39:30.803
- Yeah.

39:34.154 --> 39:35.198
Text Pete.

39:36.809 --> 39:37.592
We'’re doing this.

39:39.202 --> 39:40.943
- Dad was right.

39:41.030 --> 39:42.771
I guess I am a bad influence.

39:45.252 --> 39:46.514
- All right, guys.

39:46.601 --> 39:47.950
First rule of List Club

39:48.037 --> 39:51.389
is don'’t talk about List--
- Come on, boys!

39:51.476 --> 39:52.259
[shouting]

39:52.346 --> 39:55.001
[water splashing]

39:55.088 --> 39:58.047
- Woo!
[Sam screaming]

39:58.134 --> 39:59.962
[water splashing]
- Woo!

40:00.049 --> 40:01.311
- [Pete] Wilhelm!

40:01.399 --> 40:03.226
[water splashing]

40:03.313 --> 40:05.185
- The second rule of List Club

40:05.272 --> 40:07.927
is we have to complete
each item on the list

40:08.014 --> 40:09.015
except for the three we know

40:09.102 --> 40:10.364
have already been completed.

40:11.365 --> 40:14.107
[upbeat music]

40:14.194 --> 40:17.458
Okay, the third rule, we can
upgrade any item on the list

40:17.545 --> 40:20.156
if it'’s totally lame or
not doable in this decade.

40:21.070 --> 40:23.464
- So like the last item,

40:23.551 --> 40:25.335
performing a song in
front of a live audience?

40:25.423 --> 40:26.598
- Why that one?

40:26.685 --> 40:28.382
Livie told met that the two of
you guys

40:28.469 --> 40:30.993
played the guitar and there'’s
a Summerfest in two months.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.560
It'’d be a great opportunity.

40:32.647 --> 40:33.692
- Actually, she sings.

40:33.779 --> 40:34.867
- Really?

40:36.172 --> 40:38.784
- Are we going to drink these or
not?

40:38.871 --> 40:39.611
- Bottoms up!

40:43.789 --> 40:48.054
- So Kyle, bowling alley Kyle?

40:48.141 --> 40:50.622
- [laughing] Yeah, yeah.

40:50.709 --> 40:52.362
Yeah [laughing].

40:52.450 --> 40:55.235
- So that'’s why he was
acting so weird around you.

40:55.322 --> 40:56.454
You stood him up.

40:56.541 --> 40:58.499
- [Norah] Oh, come on.

40:58.586 --> 40:59.935
I showed up late.

41:00.022 --> 41:01.241
- Never on time Norah.

41:03.199 --> 41:06.768
- So, how'’s it going with the
Steeles?

41:13.601 --> 41:15.037
- It'’s been 20 years

41:16.648 --> 41:18.911
and I still don'’t meet his
expectations.

41:20.303 --> 41:21.653
- He wants to help.

41:22.958 --> 41:25.352
He just does it his own way.

41:25.439 --> 41:27.180
- I'’ve got a couple of job
applications,

41:29.182 --> 41:30.792
but they'’re in California.

41:30.879 --> 41:32.141
- What?

41:32.228 --> 41:33.273
Why?

41:35.884 --> 41:37.016
So, that'’s it?

41:37.103 --> 41:38.583
You'’re just gonna go back?

41:41.063 --> 41:42.064
- They'’ve got some really
good opporitunities

41:42.151 --> 41:43.022
out there, Norah.

41:44.371 --> 41:46.373
- You know what, Jonathan?

41:46.460 --> 41:49.550
You have got really good kids!

41:50.943 --> 41:52.248
Really good.

41:56.992 --> 41:58.777
- Well, all I know is that none
of us

42:01.257 --> 42:03.912
have been happy for a really
long time.

42:03.999 --> 42:05.871
- Well, can I tell you what I
know?

42:07.263 --> 42:08.351
- [Jonathan] Enlighten me.

42:18.274 --> 42:19.667
- You are the only one

42:19.754 --> 42:21.364
who'’s gonna be able to change
that.

42:30.199 --> 42:31.636
- Call the junk company
tomorrow.

42:34.377 --> 42:35.161
I'’ve got what I need.

42:42.821 --> 42:43.996
- This is never gonna work.

42:44.083 --> 42:45.519
- Come on, the list says a hole-
in-one

42:45.606 --> 42:47.129
and we'’ve gotta follow the
rules.

42:52.787 --> 42:55.181
- We can do this, guys, I
promise.

42:55.268 --> 42:57.400
Plus, it'’s supposed to be fun,
right?

43:02.797 --> 43:04.538
[silly music]

43:04.625 --> 43:06.409
[Pete shouting]

43:06.496 --> 43:07.454
What the?

43:07.541 --> 43:08.498
[groaning]

43:08.586 --> 43:09.456
I call upgrade!

43:10.413 --> 43:12.546
[Pete groaning]

43:12.633 --> 43:13.852
This game is so stupid!

43:15.244 --> 43:16.289
Halfway should be fine.

43:17.682 --> 43:19.422
You know my grandparents
actually banned me

43:19.509 --> 43:21.686
from this game once.
- Really?

43:21.773 --> 43:22.861
I wonder why.

43:31.260 --> 43:33.480
- I call upgrade!

43:33.567 --> 43:35.656
As long as it'’s outside
the green, it still counts.

43:37.658 --> 43:40.400
[Pete sighing]

43:41.401 --> 43:44.230
[Pete shouting]

43:45.405 --> 43:47.320
Freaking hate this game!

43:48.451 --> 43:49.714
[Pete shouting]

43:49.801 --> 43:50.628
- [Dylan] Pete!

43:50.715 --> 43:51.411
[Pete shouting]

43:51.498 --> 43:52.281
Hey, hey.

43:53.195 --> 43:54.283
Do you trust me?

43:55.067 --> 43:56.546
Aladdin?

43:56.634 --> 43:58.200
- Upgrade, come on.

43:58.287 --> 43:59.114
Let'’s go.

44:00.986 --> 44:02.683
- Are you okay?

44:02.770 --> 44:04.163
[Pete scoffing]

44:04.250 --> 44:07.993
- It'’s come to this, mini golf?

44:10.560 --> 44:11.518
- Hey!

44:13.041 --> 44:14.652
Look, check it out.

44:14.739 --> 44:16.828
[Pete sobbing]

44:16.915 --> 44:18.481
- Hey, PD3!

44:18.568 --> 44:20.919
What'’s wrong?
- What'’s the matter?

44:21.006 --> 44:21.702
[Pete groaning]

44:21.789 --> 44:23.835
[laughing]

44:36.108 --> 44:36.978
- You did it!

44:37.065 --> 44:38.414
- I did it, I did it!

44:38.501 --> 44:40.068
I hit a hole-in-one!
- You did it?

44:40.155 --> 44:41.417
[faint chattering]
We did it!

44:41.504 --> 44:42.854
- Good job, Sam!
- Yeah, hoo, hoo!

44:42.941 --> 44:44.203
- Woo-hoo-hoo!
- Woo-hoo!

44:44.290 --> 44:45.421
Woo-hoo!
- I got a hole-in-one!

44:45.508 --> 44:46.292
- [Dylan] Yeah [laughing]!

44:46.379 --> 44:47.467
Woo-hoo-hoo!
- Yes!

44:47.554 --> 44:50.122
Oh, we can go home now!
- No!

44:50.209 --> 44:51.471
No, now I'’m having fun.

44:51.558 --> 44:52.690
Come on, it'’s your turn.

44:53.952 --> 44:55.562
- [Jackson] All in the elbows,
PD3.

44:55.649 --> 44:58.173
- Hey, yeah, PD3!
- All in the elbows.

44:58.260 --> 44:59.958
- You can do this.
- Pick it up.

45:00.045 --> 45:03.178
PD3!
[laughing]

45:03.265 --> 45:04.397
- He'’ll never hit the ball.

45:04.484 --> 45:05.224
- Nope.
- No.

45:05.311 --> 45:08.183
[faint chattering]

45:10.490 --> 45:14.668
- Oh!
[laughing]

45:14.755 --> 45:16.365
Oh my Gosh.
