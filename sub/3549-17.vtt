WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:05.176
BEFORE WE MET, I WAS MARRIED
TO SOMEONE ELSE, BUT SHE DIED.

00:05.176 --> 00:06.377
EDIE'S QUEST BEGAN.
 WHAT WOULD YOU AND KATHERINE

00:06.377 --> 00:09.310
THINK ABOUT GOING CAMPING?
 IT'S GONNA BE FUN.

00:09.310 --> 00:13.044
AND DAVE'S PLAN MOVED FORWARD.
 THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.

00:13.044 --> 00:15.586
WERE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT
WANTING TO GO BACK TO WORK?

00:15.586 --> 00:18.489
LYNETTE TOOK A NEW PATH.
 NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

00:18.489 --> 00:20.291
TELL CARLOS HE'S FIRED.

00:20.291 --> 00:23.054
BUT IT WAS CARLOS' BOSS...

00:23.054 --> 00:26.297
HE JUST KEPT TELLING ME
HE LOVES HER.
 WHO WAS TERMINATED.

00:26.297 --> 00:28.499
I JUST WANTED HIM
TO STOP TALKING.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.504
COME ON, GABY.

00:33.504 --> 00:35.266
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

00:37.768 --> 00:41.512
(Mary Alice) GABRIELLE SOLIS
HATED GOING TO FUNERALS

00:41.512 --> 00:43.814
FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS--

00:43.814 --> 00:48.219
BLACK WAS NOT HER COLOR...

00:48.219 --> 00:50.121
(woman crying)

00:50.121 --> 00:53.053
CRYING DEPRESSED HER...

00:53.053 --> 00:56.087
AND LILIES MADE HER SNEEZE.

00:56.087 --> 00:57.288
(sneezes)

00:57.288 --> 00:59.090
(sighs)

00:59.090 --> 01:02.833
ALSO, GABRIELLE DESPISED
ANY EVENT...

01:02.833 --> 01:07.438
WHERE SHE WAS NOT
THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.

01:07.438 --> 01:13.204
LUCKILY, AT THIS FUNERAL,
THAT WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM.

01:13.204 --> 01:15.406
(lowered voice) GABY,
I WAS HOPING YOU'D BE HERE.

01:15.406 --> 01:18.209
EVERYONE IS SAYING THAT
YOU AND CARLOS WERE THERE,

01:18.209 --> 01:22.483
YOU KNOW,
WHEN MARIA KILLED BRADLEY.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.486
(scoffs) YOU KNOW, JODY,
I REALLY DON'T THINK THIS IS

01:25.486 --> 01:28.689
THE TIME OR PLACE
TO DISCUSS GORY DETAILS.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.491
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

01:30.491 --> 01:33.194
(whispers)
SIT NEXT TO ME AT THE WAKE.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.531
(whispers)
I WANT TO GO HOME!

01:40.531 --> 01:43.534
WELL, WE JUST GOT HERE.
THE FUNERAL HASN'T EVEN STARTED.

01:43.534 --> 01:46.537
YEAH, WELL, I HAVE A FEELING
MOST OF THESE VULTURES

01:46.537 --> 01:48.539
DIDN'T COME TO PAY
THEIR RESPECTS TO BRAD.

01:48.539 --> 01:50.741
THEY'RE JUST HERE TO PUMP US
FOR DIRT ABOUT HIS MURDER.

01:50.741 --> 01:53.414
OKAY, EVEN SO, I CAN'T BE SEEN
WALKING OUT OF HERE EARLY.

01:53.414 --> 01:56.787
THESE PEOPLE ARE MY COWORKERS.
 WERE YOUR COWORKERS.
BRADLEY FIRED YOU. REMEMBER?

01:56.787 --> 01:59.150
YEAH, AND MARIA KILLED HIM
EIGHT HOURS LATER.

01:59.150 --> 02:00.891
HE MIGHT NOT HAVE TOLD ANYONE,
SO PIPE DOWN.

02:00.891 --> 02:02.593
WE DON'T NEED PEOPLE THINKING

02:02.593 --> 02:04.825
THAT WE PUT THE KNIFE
IN MARIA'S HANDS.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.228
CARLOS.
 (Carlos) OH, HI.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.600
GABY, THIS IS, UH,
OWEN JOHNSTON, OUR C.E.O.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.362
OH, HI.

02:11.362 --> 02:14.305
HOW DO YOU DO?
I KNOW IT'S AN AWKWARD TIME,

02:14.305 --> 02:16.767
BUT I MUST CATCH A PLANE
RIGHT AFTER THE SERVICE,

02:16.767 --> 02:19.810
AND I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
 ABOUT WHAT?

02:19.810 --> 02:21.812
BRADLEY CALLED ME
BEFORE HE DIED.

02:21.812 --> 02:25.176
HE WANTED TO DISCUSS
YOUR JOB PERFORMANCE.

02:25.176 --> 02:27.818
WELL, WHAT DID HE SAY?

02:27.818 --> 02:29.180
WELL, SADLY,

02:29.180 --> 02:32.183
BY THE TIME I RETURNED THE CALL,
HE WAS DEAD.

02:32.183 --> 02:35.386
REALLY?

02:35.386 --> 02:37.788
BUT I THINK I KNOW
WHAT HE WANTED TO TELL ME.

02:37.788 --> 02:39.690
OH?

02:39.690 --> 02:43.234
BASED UPON THE BIG BONUS
HE FOUGHT FOR CARLOS TO HAVE,

02:43.234 --> 02:46.437
IT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS HE WAS
GOING TO RECOMMEND A PROMOTION.

02:48.239 --> 02:50.241
THAT WAS MY GUESS, TOO.

02:50.241 --> 02:52.243
THE TERRIBLE IRONY IS
HE DIDN'T REALIZE

02:52.243 --> 02:54.245
THE JOB HE WAS RECOMMENDING

02:54.245 --> 02:56.347
WOULD TURN OUT
TO BE HIS OWN.

02:56.347 --> 02:58.649
WAIT.

02:58.649 --> 03:00.481
SO YOU'RE OFFERING ME

03:00.481 --> 03:03.214
BRADLEY'S JOB
AS PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY?

03:03.214 --> 03:05.516
I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYONE BETTER SUITED.

03:05.516 --> 03:09.790
NOW, OF COURSE, IT WOULD BE
THE SAME COMPENSATION PACKAGE.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.593
PLEASE.
TELL ME YOU'LL ACCEPT.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.466
HE SURE WILL. (chuckles)

03:15.466 --> 03:17.968
THE MAN HAS
A PLANE TO CATCH.

03:17.968 --> 03:20.431
I'D BE HONORED
TO STEP IN FOR BRADLEY.

03:20.431 --> 03:23.203
GOOD. I'M GLAD
WE'VE GOT THAT HANDLED.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.206
NOW WE CAN FOCUS ON THE SORROW
OF THIS TRAGIC DAY.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.738
MM.

03:27.738 --> 03:30.911
(lowered voice)
THE SAME COMPENSATION PACKAGE!

03:30.911 --> 03:33.984
WE'RE RICH! (gasps)

03:33.984 --> 03:36.487
(lowered voice)
WE ARE AT A FUNERAL.

03:36.487 --> 03:37.988
PLEASE BE QUIET.

03:37.988 --> 03:39.620
OKAY.

03:39.620 --> 03:43.694
YES, GABRIELLE SOLIS HATED
GOING TO FUNERALS...

03:43.694 --> 03:46.927
AND FOR GOD SAKES,
STOP SMILING.

03:46.927 --> 03:51.402
MOSTLY BECAUSE
SHE COULDN'T PRETEND TO BE SAD

03:51.402 --> 04:03.714
WHEN SHE WASN'T.

04:03.714 --> 04:07.748
YOU CAN FIND THEM
ON ANY SIDEWALK IN ANY CITY...

04:07.748 --> 04:10.381
PEOPLE WITH AGENDAS--

04:10.381 --> 04:13.424
THE WOMAN
WHO CALLS UP AN OLD FRIEND

04:13.424 --> 04:16.627
BECAUSE SHE WANTS
TO BORROW SOME CASH...

04:16.627 --> 04:19.860
THE MAN WHO TAKES HIS BOSS
TO LUNCH

04:19.860 --> 04:23.294
BECAUSE HE WANTS
THE CORNER OFFICE...

04:23.294 --> 04:25.936
THE GIRL WHO LOOKS AFTER
HER UNCLE

04:25.936 --> 04:29.039
BECAUSE SHE WANTS
TO BE IN THE WILL...

04:29.039 --> 04:33.604
YES, YOU CAN SEE THESE PEOPLE
ALMOST EVERYWHERE.

04:33.604 --> 04:38.979
DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO KEEP
THEIR AGENDAS HIDDEN.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.413
HELLO.

04:42.413 --> 04:43.554
HELLO.

04:43.554 --> 04:46.016
I NEED TO LOOK SOMEONE UP
IN YOUR ARCHIVES.

04:46.016 --> 04:49.420
IT'S A CLIENT, AND HE'S, UH,
A BIT OF A SMOOTH TALKER.

04:49.420 --> 04:53.063
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HE'S
NOT GIVING ME THE RUNAROUND.

04:53.063 --> 04:54.665
SURE. WHAT'S HIS NAME?

04:54.665 --> 04:57.498
DAVID... DASH.

04:57.498 --> 05:01.372
ALL I'VE GOT HERE ARE
THE OBITUARIES.

05:01.372 --> 05:04.535
ANYTHING ELSE WILL TAKE ME
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

05:04.535 --> 05:07.478
FINE.
LET'S START WITH THE OBITS.

05:07.478 --> 05:09.640
NO DAVID...

05:09.640 --> 05:11.782
THAT'S PROBABLY
BECAUSE HE'S NOT DEAD.

05:11.782 --> 05:13.544
TRY LILA.

05:14.945 --> 05:16.917
LILA DASH.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.920
KILLED THREE YEARS AGO,
CAR CRASH.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.093
THAT WAS HIS WIFE.
GIVE ME THAT ONE.

05:23.093 --> 05:24.595
OKAY.

05:24.595 --> 05:27.097
YOU WANT PAIGE DASH, TOO?

05:27.097 --> 05:28.899
PAIGE?

05:28.899 --> 05:31.362
YEAH, THEIR DAUGHTER.

05:31.362 --> 05:33.704
"PAIGE DASH, 3 YEARS OLD,

05:33.704 --> 05:35.936
DAUGHTER OF LILA AND DAVID."

05:35.936 --> 05:39.840
IT SAYS HERE SHE DIED
IN THE SAME CRASH.

05:51.622 --> 05:53.984
(speaks inaudibly)

05:56.887 --> 06:00.090
WHO ARE WE DISHING?
I DO HOPE IT'S NOT ME.

06:00.090 --> 06:03.994
NO,
WE'VE ALREADY COVERED YOU.
 WE'VE MOVED ON
TO MY DAUGHTER, THE THIEF.

06:03.994 --> 06:05.666
OH, DEAR. WHAT HAPPENED?

06:05.666 --> 06:07.668
I'M MISSING
MY SMALL CANDY DISH.

06:07.668 --> 06:11.371
I HAD IT LAST NIGHT WHEN
YOU GUYS WERE OVER FOR DINNER,

06:11.371 --> 06:13.373
BECAUSE I REMEMBER
ORSON ADMIRING IT.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.976
YES, I, UH...
REMEMBER THAT.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.709
ANYWAY, JUANITA WENT OVER
BEFORE BREAKFAST

06:18.709 --> 06:20.711
TO INVITE M.J.
TO HER BIRTHDAY PARTY,

06:20.711 --> 06:22.953
AND, WELL,
CANDY PLUS JUANITA.

06:22.953 --> 06:25.055
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
SHERLOCK HOLMES

06:25.055 --> 06:29.059
TO CRACK THIS CASE.
 WELL, WE DON'T KNOW THAT FOR
SURE. I COULD HAVE MISPLACED IT.

06:29.059 --> 06:31.121
I'M SURE
IT'LL TURN UP SOMEWHERE.

06:31.121 --> 06:32.963
WELL... I'M OFF.

06:32.963 --> 06:34.665
(tires screech)

06:37.768 --> 06:41.702
ANDREW, CANCEL MY LUNCH.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.003
NO, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.706
YOUR STEPFATHER'S
JUST MISPLACED A FEW THINGS,

06:45.706 --> 06:48.609
AND I NEED TO FIND THEM.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.010
(beep)

06:50.010 --> 06:53.043
(Lynette)
HEY, TOM. NO, STILL WAITING.

06:53.043 --> 06:55.946
BIG SURPRISE. THEY'RE RUNNING
BEHIND AT AN AD AGENCY.

06:55.946 --> 06:57.087
(laughs)

06:57.087 --> 07:00.551
SO DID ANY
OF THOSE OTHER PLACES CALL BACK?

07:00.551 --> 07:03.093
SERIOUSLY?

07:03.093 --> 07:07.127
SIX INTERVIEWS AND NOTHIN'?

07:07.127 --> 07:10.100
WELL, I SHOULD PROBABLY TRY
AND KEEP MY GAME FACE ON HERE.

07:10.100 --> 07:13.203
I'LL--I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
I LOVE YOU. BYE.

07:13.203 --> 07:14.765
(beep)

07:14.765 --> 07:16.607
MARIANA!

07:16.607 --> 07:19.610
I HAD A FEELING THAT YOU'D BE
INTERVIEWING FOR THIS!

07:19.610 --> 07:21.141
HEY, NIKKI.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.844
(laughs) SO I GUESS ANNA SHOULD
BE SHOWING UP ANY MINUTE, TOO.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.747
NO. YOU DIDN'T HEAR?
SHE'S PREGNANT.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.149
OH, MY GOD.
A KID AND SHE JUST TURNED 30?

07:29.149 --> 07:31.151
BYE-BYE, CAREER.
 OH, DON'T START.

07:31.151 --> 07:34.985
I'M GONNA BE 30 IN 2 YEARS.
I FEEL SO OLD.

07:34.985 --> 07:37.027
DO YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT'S EVEN SADDER?

07:37.027 --> 07:39.590
I JUST HEARD THAT
VERONICA'S LOOKING FOR WORK,

07:39.590 --> 07:41.091
AND SHE'S 39.

07:41.091 --> 07:42.593
IN THIS BUSINESS? (laughs)

07:42.593 --> 07:45.566
AFTER 35, THEY TAKE YOU OUT BACK
AND THEY SHOOT YOU IN THE FACE.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.567
(laughing)

07:46.567 --> 07:49.469
(laughter)

07:49.469 --> 07:51.071
LYNETTE SCAVO.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.773
WE'RE READY FOR YOU.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.074
COMING.

07:55.806 --> 07:57.107
DO ME A FAVOR.

07:57.107 --> 08:01.682
IF YOU HEAR A GUNSHOT,
TELL MY FOUR KIDS I LOVE THEM.

08:04.585 --> 08:08.158
(reggae music playing)

08:08.158 --> 08:11.161
NOW AS YOU LISTEN TO THE MUSIC,

08:11.161 --> 08:14.094
SEE WHAT POPS INTO YOUR HEAD.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.828
WHAT SHAPES
DOES IT MAKE YOU SEE?

08:17.828 --> 08:19.830
WHAT COLORS
ARE YOU THINKING OF?

08:19.830 --> 08:22.132
UH, WHY ARE THE CHILDREN
DRAWING WITH CRAYONS?

08:22.132 --> 08:24.104
THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE MAKING CLAY VASES.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.136
WELL, I WANTED
TO DO SOMETHING MORE FREE.

08:26.136 --> 08:29.139
IT'S AN IMAGINATION-BUILDING
EXERCISE.

08:29.139 --> 08:32.082
LOOKS LIKE
A LOT OF SCRIBBLING TO ME.
 (turns music off)

08:32.082 --> 08:33.884
SUSAN,

08:33.884 --> 08:37.517
THESE PARENTS PAY $22,000 A YEAR
TO SEND THEIR KIDS HERE.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.150
AS ART TEACHERS,
IT'S OUR JOB TO GIVE THEM

08:40.150 --> 08:42.993
SOMETHING ADORABLE
TO PUT ON THEIR DESKS

08:42.993 --> 08:46.096
TO SMILE AT WHILE THEY WRITE
THOSE TUITION CHECKS.

08:46.096 --> 08:47.558
I MEAN,

08:47.558 --> 08:49.560
NO ONE'S GONNA FIND

08:49.560 --> 08:52.763
THIS MEANINGLESS CHICKEN SCRATCH
ADORABLE.

08:54.164 --> 08:56.166
NOT YOURS, MIA.
YOURS SHOWS REAL PROMISE.

08:58.238 --> 09:02.012
JESSIE, YOU SAID THAT I COULD
PLAN THE LESSON TODAY,

09:02.012 --> 09:05.215
AND I THINK
THIS IS VALUABLE.

09:05.215 --> 09:07.217
I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE CREATIVE.

09:07.217 --> 09:08.849
FINE.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.921
BUT YOU KNOW WHERE I STAND.

09:13.183 --> 09:16.687
WHAT'S AN "EVALLEY-ATION,"
MISS SUSAN?

09:16.687 --> 09:18.228
AN EVALUATION?

09:18.228 --> 09:22.032
WELL, THAT IS WHEN
SOMEONE JUDGES YOUR WORK

09:22.032 --> 09:24.795
AND GIVES YOU A GRADE ON IT.

09:24.795 --> 09:27.968
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT DOING THAT TODAY.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.070
NO,
THEY'RE DOING IT TO YOU.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.202
WHO?

09:32.202 --> 09:34.945
MISS JESSIE
AND PRINCIPAL HOBSON.

09:34.945 --> 09:36.246
I HEARD THEM TALKING.

09:36.246 --> 09:38.609
OH, RIGHT. THAT'S NOT
TILL LATER THIS YEAR.

09:38.609 --> 09:41.612
NO, IT'S THIS WEEK.
I HOPE YOU DON'T GET FIRED.

09:41.612 --> 09:43.614
THE LADY
WITH THE PURPLE SWEATER

09:43.614 --> 09:47.758
ARGUED WITH MISS JESSIE
LIKE YOU DID, AND SHE'S GONE.

09:47.758 --> 09:50.861
THE LADY
WITH THE PURPLE SWEATER?

09:50.861 --> 09:54.164
I NEVER LEARNED HER NAME.
SHE WASN'T HERE THAT LONG.

09:54.164 --> 09:56.096
SHE WAS CREATIVE, TOO.

09:58.929 --> 10:00.230
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

10:00.230 --> 10:02.633
GRAB SOME CLAY.
WE'RE MAKING VASES.

10:04.034 --> 10:07.037
DARLING, I'M HOME.

10:07.037 --> 10:09.940
OH, AND I'M FAMISHED!

10:09.940 --> 10:11.982
WHAT ARE WE HAVING FOR DINNER?

10:17.017 --> 10:19.119
HOW ABOUT A CONFESSION?

10:21.652 --> 10:23.724
SIT DOWN.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.631
START TALKING.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.104
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

10:34.104 --> 10:36.066
I WANT YOU TO EXPLAIN TO ME

10:36.066 --> 10:38.068
WHY THIS INSANITY
IS STILL GOING ON.

10:38.068 --> 10:40.210
WHEN YOU STOLE
THAT TAPE RECORDER,

10:40.210 --> 10:42.212
YOU SAID IT WAS
A ONETIME THING,

10:42.212 --> 10:44.274
AN IMPULSIVE ACT
OF REVENGE.

10:44.274 --> 10:48.178
IT WAS, AT FIRST.

10:48.178 --> 10:50.881
BUT THEN... (sighs)

10:50.881 --> 10:54.755
I KNOW IT SOUNDS ODD, BUT...

10:54.755 --> 10:58.188
IT STARTED GIVING ME
A THRILL.

10:58.188 --> 11:00.230
A THRILL?

11:00.230 --> 11:05.335
STEALING A CERAMIC DUCK
GIVES YOU A THRILL?

11:05.335 --> 11:07.167
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.139
WELL, MAYBE YOU'D FEEL
MORE COMFORTABLE

11:09.139 --> 11:10.871
TALKING TO A PROFESSIONAL.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.704
A PSYCHIATRIST?

11:13.704 --> 11:17.207
(laughs) GOOD HEAVENS.
BREE, I'M NOT CRAZY.

11:17.207 --> 11:18.709
(chuckles nervously)

11:20.881 --> 11:22.913
LOOK, I'LL STOP.

11:22.913 --> 11:25.085
I'LL--I'LL TELL EVERYONE
I'M SORRY

11:25.085 --> 11:26.957
AND RETURN EVERYTHING.

11:26.957 --> 11:29.089
YOU WILL DO NO SUCH THING.
FROM THIS MOMENT ON,

11:29.089 --> 11:32.162
YOU ARE FORBIDDEN FROM ENTERING
ANY OF OUR FRIENDS' HOMES.

11:32.162 --> 11:35.325
BUT HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET THESE THINGS BACK?

11:35.325 --> 11:38.428
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

11:58.348 --> 12:00.720
I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.723
I KNOW I SPRUNG THIS ON YOU
AT THE LAST MINUTE.
 OH, ACTUALLY,

12:03.723 --> 12:06.726
I WAS JUST GONNA WATCH A DVD
AND ORDER SOME TAKEOUT,

12:06.726 --> 12:08.759
SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO A HOME-COOKED MEAL.

12:08.759 --> 12:10.060
OH, WELL, KEEP LOOKING,

12:10.060 --> 12:13.433
'CAUSE I DON'T COOK,
AND SHANGHAI PANDA DELIVERS.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.405
OH. WELL, THAT'LL BE FINE.

12:15.405 --> 12:17.107
YOU KNOW, SUSAN,

12:17.107 --> 12:20.070
I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED
TO GET YOUR INVITATION.

12:20.070 --> 12:21.772
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,

12:21.772 --> 12:25.175
I JUST THINK THAT SCHOOL
IS SUCH A FORMAL ENVIRONMENT,

12:25.175 --> 12:28.118
AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE
IF WE COULD LET LOOSE

12:28.118 --> 12:32.252
AND DRINK A LITTLE WINE,
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.284
OH, MY GOSH.
 (cork pops)

12:34.284 --> 12:37.157
WHAT?
 (laughs) LOOK AT YOU.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.159
YOU'RE LIKE THAT SCHOOLMARM
IN THE MOVIES

12:39.159 --> 12:42.963
WHO LETS DOWN HER HAIR
AND VA-VA-VA-VOOM.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.164
(laughs)

12:44.164 --> 12:47.197
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN
A VA-VA-VA-VOOM BEFORE.

12:47.197 --> 12:50.200
THANKS. YOU LOOK NICE, TOO.

12:50.200 --> 12:53.173
OH, PLEASE. I DIDN'T EVEN
GET A CHANCE TO CHANGE.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.405
MY EX WAS LATE
PICKING UP M.J.,

12:55.405 --> 12:58.108
WHICH IS INSANE, 'CAUSE HE LIVES
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.

12:58.108 --> 13:00.210
YOUR EX LIVES
ACROSS THE STREET?

13:00.210 --> 13:03.283
(sighs) HE DECIDED TO SHACK UP
WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.485
AND PEOPLE WONDER WHY
I'M THROUGH WITH MEN.

13:07.357 --> 13:10.060
SO WHAT ARE WE TOASTING TO?

13:10.060 --> 13:12.562
GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER
BETTER.
 (clink)

13:12.562 --> 13:14.324
OH, NAPKINS.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.969
I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

13:18.969 --> 13:21.972
(grunts)

13:21.972 --> 13:24.104
OH, HEY, MIKE. COME ON IN.

13:24.104 --> 13:27.107
I WENT A LITTLE CRAZY
AT THE CAMPING SUPPLY STORE.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.880
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.
I GOT KATHERINE HER OWN LANTERN.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.882
I KNOW SHE WAS
A LITTLE WORRIED

13:31.882 --> 13:34.184
ABOUT FINDING THE LATRINE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

13:34.184 --> 13:36.386
UH, ACTUALLY, THAT'S,
UH, WHY I CAME BY.

13:36.386 --> 13:38.388
KATHERINE SORT OF BAILED.

13:38.388 --> 13:42.822
BAILED? YOU MEAN SHE'S NOT
GOING CAMPING WITH US?

13:42.822 --> 13:45.155
AH, SHE'S REALLY SORRY,

13:45.155 --> 13:47.157
BUT SHE'S GOTTA
GET HER TAXES DONE.

13:47.157 --> 13:49.930
SO KATHERINE IS
BLOWING US OFF FOR TAXES.

13:49.930 --> 13:54.104
ALSO, I THINK SHE'S WORRIED
SHE'D JUST BE A THIRD WHEEL.

13:54.104 --> 13:56.006
WHAT? OH, COME ON.

13:56.006 --> 13:59.009
I MEAN, THIS TRIP IS AS MUCH
ABOUT HER AS IT IS ABOUT US.

13:59.009 --> 14:03.143
TELL HER SHE'S GOTTA COME.
 FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T TELL
 KATHERINE TO DO ANYTHING.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.115
AND IT'LL BE BETTER
WITH JUST US GUYS.

14:05.115 --> 14:07.217
WE CAN BURP AND SCRATCH
TO OUR HEART'S CONTENT.

14:07.217 --> 14:08.518
BESIDES,
KATHERINE WAS NEVER

14:08.518 --> 14:10.620
PART OF THE ORIGINAL PLAN
ANYWAY.

14:10.620 --> 14:13.023
NO, SHE WASN'T.

14:13.023 --> 14:15.255
ALL RIGHT, I'LL, UH,
SEE YOU SATURDAY.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.088
YEAH.
 (door closes)

14:33.003 --> 14:35.345
(slurring)
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.

14:35.345 --> 14:38.148
I'M NOT SAYING
I'M GIVING UP ON LOVE.

14:38.148 --> 14:41.151
I'M SAYING
I'VE ALREADY GIVEN UP.

14:41.151 --> 14:43.113
NO. I-I WILL NOT LET YOU.

14:43.113 --> 14:46.256
YOU ARE TOO SMART AND FUNNY
AND ADORABLE.

14:46.256 --> 14:48.288
AM I?

14:48.288 --> 14:51.291
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE
BEEN COMPLIMENTED LIKE THAT.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.363
WELL, I MEAN IT.

14:53.363 --> 14:56.196
ANYONE WOULD BE LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU.

14:56.196 --> 14:59.099
YOU ARE A CATCH.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.433
(gasps)

15:03.433 --> 15:06.336
JEEZ.
HOW DID IT GET SO LATE?

15:06.336 --> 15:09.179
IS THERE A SCHOOL POLICY
ON SHOWING UP TO WORK DRUNK?

15:09.179 --> 15:12.112
(swallows)
IT'S FROWNED UPON.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.344
OH.

15:14.344 --> 15:16.916
I'VE HAD THE BEST TIME
TONIGHT.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.518
OH, ME, TOO.

15:18.518 --> 15:22.322
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE SHOULD
PROBABLY KEEP THIS BETWEEN US.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.595
WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TALKING AT WORK.
 IT'LL BE OUR LITTLE SECRET.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.961
OHH.

15:30.961 --> 15:34.234
SO... YOU THINK YOU MIGHT
WANNA DO THIS AGAIN SOMETIME?

15:34.234 --> 15:36.706
IT'S A DATE.

15:42.242 --> 15:46.046
VA-VA-VA-VOOM!

15:52.722 --> 15:56.686
S-SO WHAT KIND OF KISS
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

15:56.686 --> 15:58.989
A REGULAR KISS ON THE MOUTH...

15:58.989 --> 16:01.631
THAT LASTED A LITTLE LONGER THAN
I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

16:01.631 --> 16:04.094
SO WAS IT A GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED
AMERICAN KISS

16:04.094 --> 16:06.997
OR ARE WE TALKING THE INFINITELY
SUPERIOR FRENCH VARIETY?

16:06.997 --> 16:09.169
MM... (flaps tongue)

16:09.169 --> 16:12.202
OKAY, I'M PROBABLY JUST BLOWING
THIS OUT OF PROPORTION.

16:12.202 --> 16:15.545
I MEAN, SHE NEVER EVEN SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT BEING GAY.

16:15.545 --> 16:18.178
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE. RIGHT, LEE?

16:18.178 --> 16:19.679
WHY ASK ME?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.681
ASIDE FROM
THE OCCASIONAL PARADE,

16:21.681 --> 16:24.384
GAY MEN RARELY INTERACT
WITH LESBIANS IN THE WILD.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.017
SUSAN, IF YOU'RE NOT SURE
WHAT SHE MEANT BY IT,

16:27.017 --> 16:30.520
WHY DON'T YOU JUST HAVE
A TALK WITH HER?
 OH, THAT WOULD BE
WAY TOO AWKWARD. SHE'S MY BOSS.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.222
SHE'S YOUR BOSS?

16:32.222 --> 16:34.324
LET HER KISS YOU AGAIN,
THEN SUE HER.

16:34.324 --> 16:37.327
(laughs)
 OKAY, WE'RE GONNA
FIGURE THIS OUT FOR YOU.

16:37.327 --> 16:39.199
WERE HER EYES OPEN OR SHUT?

16:39.199 --> 16:41.671
I DON'T KNOW.

16:41.671 --> 16:44.474
WELL, HOW MANY SECONDS
DID THE KISS LAST?

16:44.474 --> 16:47.137
I DON'T REMEMBER.

16:47.137 --> 16:48.678
OH, FOR GOD SAKES.

16:48.678 --> 16:51.341
WAS IT THIS... MM.

16:51.341 --> 16:52.742
OR WAS IT THIS...

16:52.742 --> 16:54.544
(moans)

17:00.290 --> 17:02.152
THE SECOND ONE?

17:03.793 --> 17:06.326
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE NOW DATING A LESBIAN.

17:06.326 --> 17:09.098
SEE YOU AT THE PARADE.

17:09.098 --> 17:12.301
(groans softly)

17:12.301 --> 17:14.304
HEY, GABY?
 (laughs)

17:14.304 --> 17:16.035
I'LL SEE YA.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.708
I WANTED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.
FEEL FREE TO SAY NO.

17:18.708 --> 17:21.741
OH, HONEY, I'M FLATTERED, BUT I
ONLY DID THAT TO HELP SUSAN OUT.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.772
YEAH, THIS ISN'T ABOUT THAT.

17:23.772 --> 17:27.377
UM, I WANTED TO SAY I HEARD
ABOUT CARLOS' BIG PROMOTION.

17:27.377 --> 17:29.419
(chuckles nervously)
CONGRATULATIONS.

17:29.419 --> 17:32.122
THANK YOU. I MEAN,
IT'S SAD HOW IT HAPPENED,

17:32.122 --> 17:34.124
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WHEN OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS,

17:34.124 --> 17:38.328
YOU GOTTA ANSWER THE DOOR,
RIGHT?
 ABSOLUTELY. NOW YOU KNOW
I'M LOOKING FOR WORK?

17:38.328 --> 17:40.830
OH, YEAH. HOW'S THAT GOING?
 NOT GREAT. (chuckles)

17:40.830 --> 17:42.832
SEE, WHILE I WAS WORKING
AT SCAVO'S,

17:42.832 --> 17:46.366
I GOT SEVEN YEARS OLDER,
WHICH IS WEIRD,

17:46.366 --> 17:49.369
SEEING AS HOW ALL THE C.E.O.s
GOT SEVEN YEARS YOUNGER.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.372
THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
NO ONE WANTS TO HIRE SOMEONE

17:52.372 --> 17:55.745
WHO COULD HAVE MADE OUT
WITH THEIR DAD ON PROM NIGHT.

17:55.745 --> 17:57.747
(chuckles nervously)
ANYWAY, I HEAR CARLOS

17:57.747 --> 18:00.510
IS LOOKING FOR
A NEW DIRECTOR OF MARKETING.

18:00.510 --> 18:03.783
THINK YOU COULD PUT IN
A GOOD WORD FOR ME?

18:03.783 --> 18:05.615
OH. UH...

18:05.615 --> 18:07.457
I DON'T KNOW.

18:07.457 --> 18:10.360
Y-YOU DON'T KNOW?

18:10.360 --> 18:12.622
WELL, I THOUGHT
YOU DID ADVERTISING.

18:12.622 --> 18:16.226
YES, I HELPED ADVERTISE WHAT
COMPANIES DECIDED TO MARKET.

18:16.226 --> 18:17.727
IT'S THE SAME THING.

18:17.727 --> 18:20.170
COME ON.
YOU KNOW I'D BE GREAT.

18:20.170 --> 18:21.701
I GUESS.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.534
YOU GUESS? GABY...

18:24.534 --> 18:26.806
LOOK, LYNETTE, YOU'RE MY FRIEND,
AND I LOVE YOU,

18:26.806 --> 18:29.809
BUT AS FAR AS KNOWING IF YOU'RE
ANY GOOD AT YOUR JOB...

18:29.809 --> 18:32.812
(inhales sharply)
 ENOUGH WITH THE SHRUGGING.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.815
COME ON.
 YOU'RE PUTTING ME
IN A TOUGH SPOT.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.248
CARLOS IS UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE NOW,

18:38.248 --> 18:40.250
AND HE'S NOT REALLY
IN A POSITION

18:40.250 --> 18:43.523
TO BE TAKING BIG RISKS.
 YOU THINK I'M A BIG RISK?

18:43.523 --> 18:45.625
WELL...

18:45.625 --> 18:47.227
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.329
FOURTH SHRUG. I'M OUT.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.331
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.333
UGH.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.235
(door closes)

18:57.637 --> 18:59.639
YEAH, JUST FOLLOW
THE ROAD AS IT CURVES.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.412
WE'RE THE SECOND HOUSE
ON THE LEFT. OKAY, BYE.
 (beep)

19:02.412 --> 19:05.245
OH, PLACE LOOKS GREAT, BABE.
THANKS FOR DOING THIS.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.747
IT'S ALL PART OF BEING
THE PRESIDENT'S WIFE.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.351
SO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR NEW HIRE.
SHE'S GONNA BE YOUR NUMBER TWO?

19:11.351 --> 19:13.353
YEAH, AND I'M LUCKY
TO GET HER.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.355
SMART AS A WHIP,
HARVARD M.B.A.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.357
I'VE PROBABLY
MENTIONED HER BEFORE.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.558
LUCY BLACKBURN?

19:18.558 --> 19:21.631
MAYBE I'LL GO
PUT ON SOME MUSIC.

19:21.631 --> 19:23.333
LUCY BLACKBURN?

19:23.333 --> 19:25.335
PLEASE TELL ME
IT'S A COINCIDENCE THAT

19:25.335 --> 19:28.638
YOUR NEW V.P. HAS THE SAME NAME
AS YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND.
 SHE WASN'T MY GIRLFRIEND.

19:28.638 --> 19:31.241
WE WERE ROOMMATES.
WE SHARED AN APARTMENT.

19:31.241 --> 19:34.604
YOU TOLD ME
YOU SLEPT WITH HER.
 WELL, IT WAS A SMALL APARTMENT.

19:34.604 --> 19:37.807
COME ON. IT WAS A CASUAL THING,
AND IT WAS A MILLION YEARS AGO.

19:37.807 --> 19:40.810
I DON'T CARE! WHY COULDN'T YOU
HAVE TOLD ME THIS

19:40.810 --> 19:43.313
BEFORE SHE'S ABOUT TO APPEAR
ON MY DOORSTEP?

19:43.313 --> 19:47.587
I WANTED TO... BUT YOU WERE
ALWAYS NEXT TO SOMETHING SHARP.

19:47.587 --> 19:50.420
GABY, I AM IN OVER MY HEAD
WITH THIS NEW JOB,

19:50.420 --> 19:52.922
AND I NEED LUCY'S HELP.
PLEASE DON'T BE JEALOUS.

19:52.922 --> 19:56.266
(scoffs) I'M NOT JEALOUS.
IT'S JUST... YOU CAN'T HIRE HER.

19:56.266 --> 19:58.298
I'M MRS. PRESIDENT,
AND I GET A VOTE.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.969
(doorbell rings)

19:59.969 --> 20:03.303
THERE SHE IS. NOW PLEASE,
I'M BEGGING YOU...

20:03.303 --> 20:05.605
(scoffs) WELL, YOU CAN BEG
ALL YOU WANT.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.607
I AM NOT ON BOARD WITH THIS!

20:07.607 --> 20:09.909
(chuckles) HEY, LUCY!

20:09.909 --> 20:11.241
HEY!

20:11.241 --> 20:14.484
HI. I'M LUCY.
YOU MUST BE GABRIELLE.

20:14.484 --> 20:16.516
YOU CAN CALL ME GABY.
(chuckles)

20:16.516 --> 20:18.388
COME ON IN!

20:21.851 --> 20:23.523
(whispers) I'M ON BOARD.

20:33.863 --> 20:36.005
I GOT A BEAD ON CHARLIE FIELDS
FOR C.F.O.

20:36.005 --> 20:38.508
CHARLIE FIELDS? THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE GONNA GET HIM.

20:38.508 --> 20:41.010
HE'S THE NUMBER TWO GUY
AT BREWSTER & PARENT.

20:41.010 --> 20:42.942
RELAX. IT'LL TAKE
SOME MANEUVERING,

20:42.942 --> 20:45.315
BUT I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.
 HOW?

20:45.315 --> 20:46.976
CARLOS,
YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT.

20:46.976 --> 20:49.349
IT'S BEST YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE BODIES ARE BURIED.
 (Carlos laughs)

20:49.349 --> 20:50.350
AH. (chuckles)

20:50.350 --> 20:53.383
(cell phone rings)
 WELL, SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

20:53.383 --> 20:55.385
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

20:55.385 --> 20:57.657
I HAVE SOME PROFESSIONAL ETHICS
THAT NEED COMPROMISING.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.429
(chuckles)

20:59.429 --> 21:02.492
WOW. NOW I KNOW
WHY YOU WANTED TO HIRE HER.

21:02.492 --> 21:06.366
SHE'S A FORCE OF NATURE.
 MM, YOU SHOULD SEE HER
CLOSE A DEAL.

21:06.366 --> 21:09.699
I'LL BET. AHH. SO WERE YOU
SURPRISED WHEN THE DOOR OPENED?

21:09.699 --> 21:13.403
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
 WELL, SHE'S OBVIOUSLY
STOPPED COUNTING CALORIES

21:13.403 --> 21:15.405
SINCE THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HER.

21:15.405 --> 21:17.707
NO, SHE LOOKS ABOUT THE SAME.

21:17.707 --> 21:20.410
WHAT? BUT...

21:20.410 --> 21:22.812
YOU TWO USED TO HAVE SEX.

21:22.812 --> 21:24.654
YEAH. SO?

21:24.654 --> 21:26.656
SO DON'T GET ME WRONG--
SHE'S ATTRACTIVE.

21:26.656 --> 21:28.658
IT'S JUST...
SHE'S NOT REALLY YOUR TYPE.

21:28.658 --> 21:32.392
YOUR TYPE IS SKINNY MODEL.
 OKAY, SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SEE HER ON A RUNWAY.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.824
EXCEPT MAYBE AT AN AIRPORT.
 GABY!

21:34.824 --> 21:38.297
YOU THINK I'M THAT SHALLOW,
THAT ALL I GO BY IS LOOKS?

21:38.297 --> 21:41.401
YEAH, I THOUGHT THAT WAS
SOMETHING WE HAD IN COMMON.

21:41.401 --> 21:44.874
LOOK, LUCY IS BRILLIANT
AND WITTY

21:44.874 --> 21:47.607
AND HAS MORE CONFIDENCE
THAN ANYBODY I'VE EVER MET.

21:47.607 --> 21:52.011
THAT TYPE OF PERSONALITY
CAN BE VERY SEDUCTIVE.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.343
AHH!

21:53.343 --> 21:55.485
SOMEONE LIGHT ME A CIGAR.
 YOU GOT HIM?

21:55.485 --> 21:57.987
I FIND POACHING IS EASIER
WHEN YOU LEAD WITH,

21:57.987 --> 22:00.620
"WE'LL DOUBLE YOUR SALARY."
 (Carlos laughs)

22:00.620 --> 22:01.951
SIZZLE ME.

22:01.951 --> 22:03.393
(hissing)

22:03.393 --> 22:05.425
AH, THERE IT IS,

22:05.425 --> 22:08.598
THAT THRILL YOU GET FROM TAKING
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT YOURS.

22:08.598 --> 22:09.929
(laughs)
 (laughs)

22:13.563 --> 22:16.506
HEY, ARE YOU STILL LOOKING
FOR A MARKETING DIRECTOR?

22:16.506 --> 22:18.508
I HAVE A FRIEND

22:18.508 --> 22:21.841
THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE
WORKING WITH YOU TWO.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.121
NO PROBLEM, BREE.

22:32.121 --> 22:34.454
WE BY ASPIRIN BY THE POUND
IN THIS HOUSE.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.125
I'LL GET YOU SOME.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.488
AH, YOU'RE A LIFESAVER!

22:44.063 --> 22:46.065
YES, WE HAVE
LOTS OF SCREWDRIVERS.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.568
WHAT KIND DO YOU NEED?
PHILLIPS HEAD?

22:48.568 --> 22:50.870
YES, THAT WOULD BE LOVELY.

22:53.503 --> 22:56.375
I DON'T HAVE CUMIN,
BUT I PROBABLY HAVE CINNAMON.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.377
OH. (chuckles)
CLOSE ENOUGH.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.509
(unzips bag)

23:02.081 --> 23:04.754
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
TWO EGGS COMING RIGHT UP.

23:07.487 --> 23:11.160
OH! WAIT.

23:11.160 --> 23:14.393
I MADE OMELETS THIS MORNING,
SO I'M ALL OUT.

23:14.393 --> 23:18.097
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL JUST GO TO THE STORE.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.500
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?

23:21.771 --> 23:24.904
OH. I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT'S AWFULLY CUTE.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.677
UNBELIEVABLE.

23:29.178 --> 23:32.181
(scoffs) JUANITA,
GET YOUR BUTT DOWN HERE.

23:32.181 --> 23:34.544
WHY ARE YOU, UH,
CALLING JUANITA?

23:34.544 --> 23:36.516
TO FIND OUT WHAT
McCLUSKEY'S SLEEPING MEXICAN

23:36.516 --> 23:38.147
IS DOING IN MY HOUSE.

23:38.147 --> 23:41.851
THAT'S NOT YOURS?
 NO. WHY WOULD YOU
THINK THAT?

23:41.851 --> 23:45.595
OH! UH, I DON'T KNOW.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE IT IS.

23:45.595 --> 23:47.597
IT'S BEEN SITTING
ON McCLUSKEY'S PORCH FOR YEARS.

23:47.597 --> 23:49.859
I KEEP TELLING HER
HOW RACIST IT IS.

23:49.859 --> 23:52.431
FIRST THE CANDY BOWL
AND NOW THIS?

23:52.431 --> 23:55.935
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU
NOT TO STEAL?
 I DIDN'T TAKE THAT.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.508
JUANITA, YOU PLAY WITH IT EVERY
TIME WE GO BY MRS. McCLUSKEY'S.

23:58.508 --> 24:00.570
NOW EITHER
TELL ME THE TRUTH,

24:00.570 --> 24:02.942
OR I'M GONNA CANCEL
YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY.

24:02.942 --> 24:06.476
I AM TELLING YOU THE TRUTH!
 THAT'S IT. PARTY'S OVER!

24:06.476 --> 24:09.448
GABY! AREN'T YOU BEING
A LITTLE HARSH?

24:09.448 --> 24:11.450
I MEAN, PERHAPS SHE DIDN'T
TAKE IT.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.754
WELL, THEN HOW ELSE
DID IT GET HERE?

24:14.754 --> 24:17.226
MAYBE SHE DID IT.

24:18.758 --> 24:21.531
JUANITA!

24:21.531 --> 24:23.192
WHENEVER MY CHILDREN STOLE,

24:23.192 --> 24:25.695
I SENT THEM TO BED
WITHOUT ANY SUPPER.

24:25.695 --> 24:28.237
JUST A THOUGHT.

24:28.237 --> 24:30.139
(door closes)

24:34.243 --> 24:36.606
ORSON?

24:36.606 --> 24:39.248
ORSON!

24:39.248 --> 24:42.612
(strained voice)
ORSON! ORSON!

24:42.612 --> 24:44.483
(normal voice) ORSON!

24:44.483 --> 24:46.185
NO!

24:46.185 --> 24:48.958
HI, BREE!
 WHAT WERE YOU DOING
AT BOB AND LEE'S?

24:48.958 --> 24:51.490
WELL, THEY INVITED ME OVER
FOR COFFEE.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.994
AFTER I TOLD YOU TO STAY OUT
OF THE NEIGHBORS' HOUSES?

24:54.994 --> 24:57.767
(sighs deeply)
YOU STOLE AGAIN, DIDN'T YOU?

24:57.767 --> 24:59.929
NO. NO, I DIDN'T.

24:59.929 --> 25:02.031
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING
BEHIND YOUR BACK?

25:02.031 --> 25:04.233
NOTHING.

25:04.233 --> 25:06.005
IT'S MINE.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.677
YOU'RE TELLING ME

25:07.677 --> 25:11.681
YOU OWN A MUG WITH A PICTURE
OF BERNADETTE PETERS IN "GYPSY"?

25:15.585 --> 25:18.588
THIS IS QUITE A RéSUMé
YOU GOT HERE.
 OH.

25:18.588 --> 25:20.089
NORTHWESTERN, HUH?

25:20.089 --> 25:21.591
YEP. THANK YOU.

25:21.591 --> 25:23.893
SO, LYNETTE...
 MM-HMM?

25:23.893 --> 25:25.194
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

25:25.194 --> 25:27.526
UM...

25:27.526 --> 25:28.798
MR. VIVINETTO,

25:28.798 --> 25:32.261
I'M NOT OBLIGATED TO ANSWER.
IT'S THE LAW.
 RIGHT, RIGHT.

25:32.261 --> 25:34.303
I WAS ONLY ASKING 'CAUSE
I-I ALSO WENT TO NORTHWESTERN,

25:34.303 --> 25:37.006
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE WE
CROSSED PATHS THERE. (chuckles)
 OH. (laughs)

25:37.006 --> 25:39.769
WHAT--WHAT YEAR
DID YOU GRADUATE?

25:39.769 --> 25:42.772
(chuckles) WELL, IF I WAS
DUMB ENOUGH TO ANSWER THAT,

25:42.772 --> 25:44.774
I NEVER WOULD'VE
GOTTEN INTO NORTHWESTERN.

25:44.774 --> 25:47.717
I-I UNDERSTAND, BUT, UH,
I'M GONNA BE HONEST HERE.

25:47.717 --> 25:50.219
WE HAVE CERTAIN ACCOUNTS THAT
CATER TO A SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC.

25:50.219 --> 25:53.853
OKAY, I'M GONNA STOP YOU.
WHAT IS THIS OBSESSION WITH AGE?

25:53.853 --> 25:56.125
I AM A VITAL WOMAN
WITH PASSION

25:56.125 --> 25:59.328
AND A LIBRARY OF KNOWLEDGE
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS INDUSTRY.

25:59.328 --> 26:02.261
WHY DOESN'T THAT
COUNT FOR SOMETHING?
 WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

26:02.261 --> 26:04.764
WE JUST LANDED THE COSGROVE'S
REVITALIZING SERUM ACCOUNT.

26:04.764 --> 26:08.668
IT'S AN ANTIWRINKLE CREAM,
AND I NEED SOMEONE MORE MATURE

26:08.668 --> 26:11.641
WHO CAN IDENTIFY WITH THE--
 I'M 54.

26:22.912 --> 26:24.583
HE DIDN'T EVEN FLINCH.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.116
I SAID I WAS 54,
AND HE BOUGHT IT.

26:27.116 --> 26:30.119
THERE WAS NOT A "WOW,
YOU LOOK GREAT FOR YOUR AGE!"

26:30.119 --> 26:32.121
NOT EVEN A COURTESY GASP.

26:32.121 --> 26:35.825
LOOK, YOU GOT THE JOB.
YOU'RE MAKING $80,000 A YEAR.

26:35.825 --> 26:38.227
WHAT--WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

26:38.227 --> 26:41.831
IT MATTERS BECAUSE I'M ONLY 43,
AND I LOOK LIKE I'M 39.

26:41.831 --> 26:45.204
YOU'RE 43? BUT I'M--
I'M 2 YEARS YOUNGER THAN YOU,

26:45.204 --> 26:47.937
AND I--
 NOBODY CARES
HOW OLD YOU ARE, TOM.

26:47.937 --> 26:50.680
(knock on door)

26:50.680 --> 26:52.241
HEY.

26:52.241 --> 26:55.645
GREAT NEWS! YOU GOT THE JOB!
 YEAH! HOW'D YOU HEAR ABOUT IT?

26:55.645 --> 26:59.348
HEAR ABOUT IT? HONEY, I DID IT.
I TALKED TO CARLOS. YOU'RE IN.
 OH. WOW.

26:59.348 --> 27:01.250
THAT JOB.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.723
UM... I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

27:03.723 --> 27:06.025
SAY, "HOW DO I THANK YOU,
GREATEST FRIEND IN THE WORLD?

27:06.025 --> 27:09.028
WHAT'S YOUR BIRTHSTONE?"
 (laughs) WELL,
THANK YOU, GREATEST FRIEND,

27:09.028 --> 27:11.260
BUT I JUST ACCEPTED
ANOTHER JOB.

27:11.260 --> 27:13.963
WELL, UN-ACCEPT IT.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS JOB.

27:13.963 --> 27:17.366
IT'S ESSENTIAL
THAT YOU BE THERE.
 WHY?

27:17.366 --> 27:19.408
BECAUSE IT'S
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

27:19.408 --> 27:22.411
I'M CONFUSED. BEFORE, YOU DIDN'T
EVEN WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

27:22.411 --> 27:24.774
YOU WEREN'T EVEN SURE
I WAS GOOD.

27:24.774 --> 27:28.077
YEAH. YES, AND THEN
I WENT HOME AND THOUGHT,

27:28.077 --> 27:31.150
WHAT A HORRIBLE THING TO SAY
TO SUCH A DEAR, DEAR FRIEND

27:31.150 --> 27:33.683
WHO'S PROBABLY
REALLY, REALLY GOOD AT HER JOB.

27:33.683 --> 27:35.224
SO...

27:35.224 --> 27:38.287
I SAID, "CARLOS,
YOU HAVE TO HIRE LYNETTE."

27:38.287 --> 27:41.430
I... DON'T KNOW.

27:44.794 --> 27:47.296
WELL, HE'D HAVE TO MATCH
MY CURRENT OFFER.

27:47.296 --> 27:50.039
YEAH, OKAY.
WHAT ARE THEY PAYING?

27:50.039 --> 27:51.701
$100,000 A YEAR.

27:51.701 --> 27:54.443
I DON'T THINK
THAT'LL BE A PROBLEM.

27:54.443 --> 27:56.375
OH.

27:56.375 --> 27:59.378
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE GONNA
BE REPORTING TO THIS WOMAN LUCY.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.250
SHE'S A REAL STAR,

28:01.250 --> 28:03.753
SO YOU'RE GONNA WANNA
KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

28:03.753 --> 28:06.786
(footsteps approaching)

28:06.786 --> 28:09.989
DECAF SOY LATTE--
YOUR FAVORITE.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.460
THANKS.

28:11.460 --> 28:14.463
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT...
 MM, ME, TOO.

28:14.463 --> 28:17.166
MAYBE FRIDAY YOU COULD
COME OVER TO MY PLACE,

28:17.166 --> 28:19.899
AND WE COULD HANG OUT OR...
 (groans)

28:19.899 --> 28:24.904
YOU KNOW, I-I THINK YOU MAY HAVE
GOTTEN THE WRONG IMPRESSION.

28:26.736 --> 28:29.308
I'M NOT...

28:29.308 --> 28:31.941
INTO WOMEN.

28:31.941 --> 28:34.944
MM-HMM.

28:34.944 --> 28:37.346
NICE BOOTS.

28:39.318 --> 28:42.091
(gasps) I THOUGHT
IT WAS GONNA RAIN.

28:42.091 --> 28:44.053
OKAY, UM...

28:44.053 --> 28:46.155
I'M NOT GAY.

28:46.155 --> 28:49.799
MM-HMM, THEN WHAT WAS ALL THAT
STUFF ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT?

28:49.799 --> 28:53.132
THE--THE TOUCHING MY KNEE?
THE "OH, YOU LOOK SO SEXY"?

28:53.132 --> 28:55.134
THE GOOD NIGHT KISS?

28:55.134 --> 28:57.106
OH, WELL, THAT KISS
WAS ALL YOU.

28:57.106 --> 28:58.908
OH, IT WAS? (chuckles)

28:58.908 --> 29:01.841
I SEEM TO REMEMBER YOU BEING
THERE AND NOT PULLING AWAY.
 WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE--

29:01.841 --> 29:04.373
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING THEN?
 BECAUSE I--

29:04.373 --> 29:06.876
BECAUSE YOU'RE TIRED
OF LIVING A LIE.
 WHAT?

29:06.876 --> 29:09.518
I WAS YOU
20 YEARS AGO, SUSAN.

29:09.518 --> 29:11.380
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY WORRIED

29:11.380 --> 29:14.283
THERE'S A LESBIAN INSIDE OF YOU
TRYING TO GET OUT.

29:14.283 --> 29:16.786
ACTUALLY, I'M MORE WORRIED
ABOUT THE LESBIAN

29:16.786 --> 29:19.889
THAT'S OUTSIDE OF ME
TRYING TO GET IN.

29:19.889 --> 29:24.263
UM, CAN WE JUST TEACH THE CLASS
AND TALK ABOUT THIS LATER?

29:24.263 --> 29:27.136
FINE.

29:29.398 --> 29:32.441
SHOULDN'T YOU
BE DOING YOUR TAXES?

29:32.441 --> 29:34.443
OH! GOD, DAVE!
(laughs) YOU SCARED ME.

29:34.443 --> 29:36.445
OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
 OH.

29:36.445 --> 29:38.277
WHAT'S THIS I HEAR
ABOUT YOU NOT GOING CAMPING?

29:38.277 --> 29:40.980
OH, WELL, IT IS
THAT TIME OF YEAR,

29:40.980 --> 29:44.083
AND I GOT ALL THESE RECEIPTS
TO GO THROUGH.

29:44.083 --> 29:47.116
I GOTTA SAY,
I'M MIGHTY DISAPPOINTED.

29:47.116 --> 29:49.118
PLEASE.
I'M SURE YOU'RE RELIEVED

29:49.118 --> 29:51.090
THERE WON'T BE A GIRL
TAGGING ALONG

29:51.090 --> 29:54.223
TO SPOIL ALL YOUR MACHO FUN.
 WELL, SEE, NOW THAT'S
WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

29:54.223 --> 29:56.225
I MOSTLY SAW THIS TRIP

29:56.225 --> 29:59.528
AS A CHANCE
TO GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER.
 ME? WHY?

29:59.528 --> 30:01.901
KATHERINE, THE TRUTH IS,
I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.533
MAYBE THAT'S WHY MIKE'S
BECOME SO IMPORTANT TO ME.

30:04.533 --> 30:06.535
AND EVER SINCE
YOU CAME INTO HIS LIFE,

30:06.535 --> 30:08.537
WELL, I CAN SEE THE CHANGE.

30:08.537 --> 30:10.880
HE'S SO MUCH HAPPIER,
SO MUCH MORE RELAXED.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.342
YOU'VE GIVEN HIM
THIS SORT OF INNER PEACE.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.516
I JUST THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE COOL

30:17.516 --> 30:21.420
TO BECOME BUDDIES WITH THE WOMAN
WHO DID THAT FOR MY FRIEND.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.923
WELL, WHEN YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY...

30:23.923 --> 30:26.856
SO YOU'LL GO CAMPING
WITH US?

30:29.058 --> 30:31.060
I'LL GO START PACKING
MY FLEECE.

30:31.060 --> 30:33.903
FANTASTIC.
 (chuckles)

30:33.903 --> 30:36.165
DAVE?

30:38.167 --> 30:39.838
DO YOU REALLY THINK

30:39.838 --> 30:42.441
I'VE MADE THAT MUCH
OF A DIFFERENCE IN MIKE'S LIFE?

30:42.441 --> 30:43.542
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

30:43.542 --> 30:46.045
IF HE EVER LOST YOU...

30:46.045 --> 30:48.047
IT WOULD DESTROY HIM.

30:50.619 --> 30:52.621
OKAY, CLASS, LET'S SEE HOW

30:52.621 --> 30:54.623
OUR ANIMALS OF AFRICA DRAWINGS
ARE GOING.

30:54.623 --> 30:57.526
OH, EMMA,
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

30:57.526 --> 31:00.059
EMMA DREW A GAZELLE.
ISN'T SHE PRETTY?

31:00.059 --> 31:03.332
(gasps) ZACHARY,
IS THAT A RHINOCEROS?

31:03.332 --> 31:07.897
WOW! HE LOOKS SO BIG
AND STRONG.

31:07.897 --> 31:09.368
I LOVE RHINOS.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.371
DO YOU, SUSAN?
DO YOU REALLY?

31:12.371 --> 31:13.642
EXCUSE ME?

31:13.642 --> 31:16.375
I'M JUST SAYING,
IF YOU WERE ON SAFARI

31:16.375 --> 31:19.308
AND YOU SAW A SLEEK GAZELLE

31:19.308 --> 31:22.451
NEXT TO A GRUNTING,
SWEATY RHINO...

31:26.155 --> 31:29.518
YOUR EYE WOULDN'T
GO STRAIGHT TO THE GAZELLE?

31:29.518 --> 31:31.490
UH...

31:33.422 --> 31:38.367
THOUGH I WOULD DEFINITELY
APPRECIATE THE...

31:38.367 --> 31:40.469
BEAUTY OF THE GAZELLE,

31:40.469 --> 31:45.534
UH, IF I WAS GOING TO TAKE
A TRIP TO AFRICA...

31:45.534 --> 31:49.208
I WOULD BE MORE EXCITED
TO SEE THE RHINOS.

31:49.208 --> 31:50.980
I LIKE RHINOS, TOO.

31:50.980 --> 31:52.441
YES, WE KNOW, JEFFREY.

31:52.441 --> 31:55.014
WE'VE ALL SEEN YOU
PLAYING HOPSCOTCH AT RECESS.

31:55.014 --> 31:57.216
ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME

31:57.216 --> 31:59.218
THAT YOU'VE NEVER HAD
ANY EXPERIENCE WITH GAZELLES?

31:59.218 --> 32:01.450
NOT EVEN IN COLLEGE?

32:01.450 --> 32:03.022
NO.

32:03.022 --> 32:06.155
AND... I WAS
ON THE SOFTBALL TEAM.

32:08.157 --> 32:11.200
LOOK, SUSAN,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY IT?

32:11.200 --> 32:14.163
THIS PARTICULAR GAZELLE

32:14.163 --> 32:16.165
ISN'T YOUNG ENOUGH FOR YOU,

32:16.165 --> 32:18.467
AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO HURT MY FEELINGS.

32:18.467 --> 32:22.311
THAT IS NOT TRUE, AND I THINK
WE ARE DANGEROUSLY CLOSE

32:22.311 --> 32:24.473
TO NO LONGER
SPEAKING IN METAPHOR.

32:24.473 --> 32:26.976
WELL, THEN WHY WERE YOU
SO INTERESTED IN ME

32:26.976 --> 32:28.517
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

32:28.517 --> 32:30.980
WHY DID YOU ASK ME
TO YOUR HOUSE?

32:30.980 --> 32:34.053
BECAUSE I WANTED YOU
TO GIVE ME A GOOD EVALUATION.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.087
I SEE.

32:38.087 --> 32:39.388
(sighs)

32:42.631 --> 32:44.533
(door opens and closes)

32:44.533 --> 32:47.196
IT WAS NICE KNOWING YOU,
MISS SUSAN.

32:58.147 --> 33:00.509
THE PROBLEM--HOW TO ATTRACT
HIGH NET WORTH CLIENTS

33:00.509 --> 33:02.381
IN A DOWN ECONOMY.

33:02.381 --> 33:04.053
THE SOLUTION? BE CREATIVE.

33:04.053 --> 33:06.485
CHRISTIE'S IS HOSTING
ITS FIRST EVER "SEA AUCTION"

33:06.485 --> 33:08.487
ON A YACHT IN ST. BARTHS.

33:08.487 --> 33:11.720
(chuckles) I SEE A BOAT
FULL OF MILLIONAIRES

33:11.720 --> 33:13.562
WAITING TO BE WOOED.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.995
THIS IS NOT A BAD IDEA.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.368
BESIDES, I HAVEN'T BEEN
TO ST. BARTHS

33:19.368 --> 33:21.730
SINCE YOU TOOK ME THERE
TO CELEBRATE MY FIRST PROMOTION.

33:21.730 --> 33:24.333
(cell phone ringing)
 (laughs)
THAT WAS A FUN WEEKEND.

33:24.333 --> 33:25.374
(Lucy) YEAH.

33:25.374 --> 33:27.376
(sighs) LET'S DO IT.
 YEP.

33:27.376 --> 33:31.410
I GOTTA TAKE THIS.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
 OKAY.

33:31.410 --> 33:32.541
OKAY.

33:34.713 --> 33:39.788
NOT TO PRY, BUT WHEN YOU SAID
CARLOS TOOK YOU TO ST. BARTHS...

33:39.788 --> 33:43.552
OH, YEAH, WE LIVED TOGETHER
FOR A WHILE BACK IN THE DAY.

33:43.552 --> 33:46.455
OH! (chuckles)
GABY DIDN'T MENTION THAT.

33:46.455 --> 33:48.457
SEE, THAT IS WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT HER.

33:48.457 --> 33:50.459
MOST WOMEN WOULD FREAK OUT

33:50.459 --> 33:53.202
IF THEIR HUSBAND HIRED
AN EX-GIRLFRIEND

33:53.202 --> 33:55.404
AND THEY WERE WORKING TOGETHER
UNCHAPERONED.

33:55.404 --> 33:58.407
BUT SHE'S GOT THE CONFIDENCE
TO JUST BE COOL WITH IT.

33:58.407 --> 34:03.112
YEAH. YEAH, THAT GABY'S
A REAL CLASS ACT.

34:03.112 --> 34:05.174
(chuckles)

34:14.553 --> 34:16.585
(sets down eraser)

34:16.585 --> 34:19.158
JESSIE, I-I AM SO SORRY.

34:19.158 --> 34:22.360
WHY? YOU WERE JUST
BEING HONEST.

34:22.360 --> 34:25.094
STILL, UH...

34:25.094 --> 34:27.396
I NEVER MEANT
TO LEAD YOU ON.

34:27.396 --> 34:30.539
UH-HUH. WELL, I WAS
PLANNING ON GIVING YOU

34:30.539 --> 34:32.241
A GOOD EVALUATION ANYWAY,

34:32.241 --> 34:35.744
SO... EVERYTHING'S FINE.

34:35.744 --> 34:38.277
LOOK, I NEED THIS JOB.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.279
BUT EVEN IF I DIDN'T,

34:40.279 --> 34:42.281
I WOULD STILL LIKE YOU
AS A PERSON.

34:42.281 --> 34:44.783
PLEASE, STOP.
I DON'T NEED YOUR PITY.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.786
(chuckles) YOU KNOW,
I DON'T GET WHY PEOPLE SAY THAT.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.688
I-I LOVE PITY. (chuckles)

34:49.688 --> 34:53.522
PITY MEANS SOMEONE
IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

34:53.522 --> 34:55.524
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,

34:55.524 --> 34:59.168
THAT THEY SYMPATHIZE,
AND I DO.

34:59.168 --> 35:01.400
SUSAN... (sighs)

35:01.400 --> 35:05.434
I'M SOMEONE WHO NEVER WENT OUT
AND LOOKED FOR LOVE.

35:05.434 --> 35:09.107
I ASSUMED IT WOULD FIND ME.
BUT IT DIDN'T.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.510
AND NOW I'M MAKING A FOOL
OF MYSELF...

35:11.510 --> 35:15.484
(sighs) THROWING MYSELF
AT STRAIGHT WOMEN,

35:15.484 --> 35:17.746
BECAUSE I'M SO AFRAID
OF BEING ALONE.

35:17.746 --> 35:20.789
NOW HOW CAN YOU
POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND THAT?

35:20.789 --> 35:23.722
WELL, HERE'S HOW.
UM, I... (sighs)

35:23.722 --> 35:26.395
I'VE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE
PUTTING MYSELF OUT THERE,

35:26.395 --> 35:29.328
AND, UM, I'M STILL...

35:29.328 --> 35:30.759
TODAY, ALONE.

35:30.759 --> 35:32.431
JUST LIKE YOU.

35:35.164 --> 35:36.635
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.637
WELL, OKAY, IT'S NOT,

35:38.637 --> 35:42.811
BECAUSE I'M ALONE BUT I'M NOT
LONELY 'CAUSE I HAVE FRIENDS.

35:42.811 --> 35:47.576
LOVE DOESN'T HAPPEN
FOR EVERYONE.

35:47.576 --> 35:50.219
YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:50.219 --> 35:53.422
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S
GONNA HAPPEN FOR ME ANYMORE.

35:53.422 --> 35:56.625
BUT MY FRIENDS ARE THERE FOR ME
NO MATTER WHAT,

35:56.625 --> 35:58.927
AND THAT HELPS.

35:58.927 --> 36:01.460
SO AT THE VERY LEAST,

36:01.460 --> 36:04.533
YOU KNOW,
LET ME BE THERE FOR YOU...

36:04.533 --> 36:06.535
AS A FRIEND.

36:06.535 --> 36:09.568
THAT'D BE NICE.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.242
DO YOUR FRIENDS HUG?

36:19.177 --> 36:21.410
WHAT'S THAT
IN THE GARBAGE CAN?

36:21.410 --> 36:23.582
MY BOOTS.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.756
HEY! (chuckles)

36:27.756 --> 36:29.758
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

36:29.758 --> 36:33.462
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
HOW YOUR FIRST DAY WENT.

36:33.462 --> 36:35.964
SIT. TAKE A LOAD OFF.
SPILL IT. (chuckles)

36:35.964 --> 36:37.966
OH, THAT IS
SO THOUGHTFUL OF YOU.

36:37.966 --> 36:40.569
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD FRIEND.
 OH, WELL, YOU KNOW ME.

36:40.569 --> 36:42.431
YEAH, I DO.

36:42.431 --> 36:45.434
(sighs)
 SO DID YOU GET A GOOD OFFICE?
WERE THE PEOPLE NICE?

36:45.434 --> 36:47.676
OH, WHAT ABOUT LUCY?
DO YOU LIKE HER?

36:47.676 --> 36:51.440
ACTUALLY...
I AM KINDA TIRED.

36:51.440 --> 36:54.613
I THINK I'M GOING
TO HEAD INSIDE.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.485
OOH! WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:56.485 --> 36:58.747
I MENTIONED LUCY,
AND YOU GET ALL WEIRD.

36:58.747 --> 37:01.490
IS SOMETHING GOING ON
WITH HER... AND CARLOS?

37:01.490 --> 37:03.492
WHAT? NO.

37:03.492 --> 37:05.494
I'M SURE
SHE'S JUST AFFECTIONATE.

37:05.494 --> 37:08.827
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY AFFECTIONATE?

37:08.827 --> 37:10.499
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

37:10.499 --> 37:13.001
BUT WHEN CARLOS WORKS
ON HIS COMPUTER AT HOME,

37:13.001 --> 37:15.504
DOES HE TAKE HIS SHIRT OFF
THERE, TOO?

37:15.504 --> 37:19.268
THAT SON OF A--
I'M GONNA KILL HIM!

37:19.268 --> 37:22.010
NO, YOU WON'T GET THE CHANCE
'CAUSE I'M GONNA KILL YOU FIRST.

37:22.010 --> 37:23.572
HUH?

37:23.572 --> 37:26.575
THE HOUSELIGHTS ARE UP, GABY.
YOU CAN DROP THE ACT.

37:26.575 --> 37:29.718
YOU ONLY HELPED ME GET THIS JOB
BECAUSE YOU NEEDED A SPY.

37:29.718 --> 37:32.321
HOW DARE YOU!

37:32.321 --> 37:33.852
AND, YES, I DID!

37:33.852 --> 37:35.253
GABY!

37:35.253 --> 37:37.556
YOU NEEDED A JOB.
I DID YOU A FAVOR.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.928
AND THEN I BROUGHT YOU
HOT COCOA.

37:39.928 --> 37:41.930
WHY DON'T YOU EVER THANK ME?
 BECAUSE YOU USED ME!

37:41.930 --> 37:45.734
AT LEAST WHEN I ASKED YOU
FOR A FAVOR, I WAS UP-FRONT.
 OH, WERE YOU,

37:45.734 --> 37:47.736
MISS "THEY OFFERED ME
$100,000 A YEAR"?

37:47.736 --> 37:49.698
OH, YOU FOUND OUT
ABOUT THAT?

37:49.698 --> 37:52.671
HONEY, I'VE PLAYED POKER WITH
YOU FOR THE PAST NINE YEARS.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.903
I THINK I CAN TELL
WHEN YOU'RE BLUFFING.

37:54.903 --> 37:57.506
OKAY, IT'S TRUE.
I USED YOU TO GET MORE MONEY,

37:57.506 --> 38:01.450
BUT YOU USED ME FIRST.
 FINE.
WE'RE A COUPLE OF USERS.

38:01.450 --> 38:04.282
(sighs)

38:05.584 --> 38:08.286
THE BIG QUESTION IS,
ARE WE STILL FRIENDS?

38:11.820 --> 38:13.822
DO I STILL GET MY SALARY?

38:13.822 --> 38:15.824
WILL YOU STILL BE MY SPY?

38:32.681 --> 38:35.844
DAVE, I'M CURIOUS
ABOUT SOMETHING.

38:35.844 --> 38:37.716
WHAT ABOUT?

38:37.716 --> 38:40.419
WELL, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT KIDS?

38:41.690 --> 38:43.021
KIDS?

38:43.021 --> 38:45.654
YEAH. HAVEN'T YOU EVER
WANTED ONE?

38:45.654 --> 38:50.499
IS THIS YOUR COY WAY
OF TELLING ME YOU WANT A CHILD?

38:50.499 --> 38:52.801
MAYBE. I HARDLY
GET TO SEE TRAVERS ANYMORE

38:52.801 --> 38:56.334
NOW THAT HE'S OFF
AT PREP SCHOOL.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.637
AND I ALWAYS WANTED A GIRL.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.709
DOESN'T THAT SOUND
LIKE HEAVEN?

39:00.709 --> 39:02.711
A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL

39:02.711 --> 39:06.945
WITH BLONDE CURLS.

39:11.520 --> 39:16.054
I HAD THIS... FRIEND

39:16.054 --> 39:19.988
WHO HAD A LITTLE GIRL.

39:19.988 --> 39:23.792
FROM THE MOMENT SHE WAS BORN,

39:23.792 --> 39:25.964
SHE WAS HIS WHOLE LIFE.

39:28.797 --> 39:32.100
UNFORTUNATELY,
SHE WAS IN AN ACCIDENT..

39:32.100 --> 39:33.602
AND DIED.

39:35.874 --> 39:38.547
HE TOLD ME
THAT WHEN THAT HAPPENED,

39:38.547 --> 39:40.549
A PART OF HIM DIED, TOO.

39:40.549 --> 39:42.851
HE SPENT
THE REST OF HIS LIFE

39:42.851 --> 39:45.153
IN A KIND OF... DAZE,

39:45.153 --> 39:46.615
ALWAYS...

39:46.615 --> 39:50.959
WONDERING EXACTLY HOW OLD
SHE WOULD'VE BEEN,

39:50.959 --> 39:52.961
WHAT SHE WOULD'VE LOOKED LIKE.

39:57.626 --> 39:59.768
NO.

39:59.768 --> 40:03.472
I DON'T THINK
I'D WANT A CHILD.

40:03.472 --> 40:05.474
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT.

40:11.880 --> 40:13.542
YOU OKAY, BABE?

40:13.542 --> 40:14.883
(whispers) YEAH.

40:14.883 --> 40:16.545
(normal voice)
I... (sighs)

40:16.545 --> 40:19.187
I'M JUST SAD
FOR YOUR FRIEND.

40:21.590 --> 40:23.421
YEAH.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.924
I HAD HOPED THAT
THIS COMPULSION TO STEAL

40:25.924 --> 40:27.956
WAS SOMETHING
WE COULD SOLVE PRIVATELY,

40:27.956 --> 40:30.428
BUT ORSON SEEMS UNABLE--

40:30.428 --> 40:33.131
OR UNWILLING--

40:33.131 --> 40:35.103
TO CONTROL HIMSELF.

40:35.103 --> 40:39.007
IS THAT TRUE, ORSON? ARE YOU
UNABLE TO CONTROL YOURSELF?

40:39.007 --> 40:42.541
YOU'LL SEE WHEN HE LEAVES,
AND YOUR LAMP IS MISSING.

40:42.541 --> 40:45.644
SO... HOW DO YOU WANT
TO PROCEED?

40:45.644 --> 40:49.017
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BEGIN
WITH SOME COUPLES COUNSELING?

40:49.017 --> 40:51.780
THIS ISN'T MY PROBLEM,
DR. BERNSTEIN.

40:51.780 --> 40:55.123
HE'S THE SICK ONE.

40:55.123 --> 40:57.656
FIX HIM.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.530
(door opens and closes)

41:03.692 --> 41:06.795
YOU KNOW WHY SHE'S SO ANGRY?

41:08.597 --> 41:14.172
BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING
SHE CAN'T CONTROL,

41:14.172 --> 41:16.004
AND I LOVE IT.

41:19.748 --> 41:22.250
NOW THERE'S NO PHONE
IN THE CABIN,

41:22.250 --> 41:25.614
BUT IF IT'S AN EMERGENCY,
YOU CAN REACH ME ON MY CELL.

41:25.614 --> 41:27.716
YOU JUST BE CAREFUL
OUT THERE.

41:29.918 --> 41:32.721
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO
WITHOUT YOU.

41:35.694 --> 41:37.966
BYE.

41:40.599 --> 41:42.831
(sighs)

41:42.831 --> 41:45.534
HERE'S THE ARTICLE
THAT LADY WAS LOOKING FOR.

41:45.534 --> 41:47.536
YOU WANT ME TO FAX IT?

41:47.536 --> 41:50.639
AH, TAKE YOUR TIME.
SHE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS.

41:50.639 --> 41:52.681
SHE'S PRETTY HOT, THOUGH.

41:52.681 --> 41:54.683
HOW DOES THAT HELP ME?

41:54.683 --> 41:57.185
SHE CAN WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW.
 ALL RIGHT.

42:03.091 --> 42:06.695
YOU CAN FIND THEM
ALMOST ANYWHERE--

42:06.695 --> 42:09.728
FRIENDLY PEOPLE
WITH HIDDEN AGENDAS--

42:09.728 --> 42:12.631
THE WOMAN
WHO USES HER NEIGHBOR

42:12.631 --> 42:14.633
TO GET HERSELF A JOB...

42:16.905 --> 42:19.568
THE WIFE
WHO USES HER INFLUENCE

42:19.568 --> 42:22.671
TO HIRE A FRIENDLY SPY...

42:24.643 --> 42:27.245
THE HUSBAND
WHO USES HIS CHARM

42:27.245 --> 42:30.579
TO STEAL FROM HIS FRIENDS...

42:30.579 --> 42:35.584
AND YOU CAN BE SURE
THE FRIENDLIEST PEOPLE OF ALL

42:35.584 --> 42:40.689
HAVE AGENDAS THAT WON'T EVER
BE DISCOVERED...

42:40.689 --> 42:42.260
NOT UNTIL...

42:42.260 --> 42:44.593
IT'S TOO LATE.
