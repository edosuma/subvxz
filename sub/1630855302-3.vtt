WEBVTT

00:16.767 --> 00:19.854
That's good. So good.

00:22.565 --> 00:25.151
Maizers? You okay?

00:25.151 --> 00:26.694
I just finished
Mom's "fuck-it" list.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.612
She wants to spend
her last summer here with me?

00:28.612 --> 00:30.156
Fuck it. I'm gonna make her do

00:30.156 --> 00:32.074
all the boring cottage stuff
she hated here growing up.

00:32.074 --> 00:34.076
Your plan is to bore her?

00:34.076 --> 00:37.246
Yeah. It'll either force her
to confess her diagnosis

00:37.246 --> 00:38.789
or hop on
the next flight to Madrid.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.166
I'm starting with
the Boathouse's

00:40.166 --> 00:41.709
Annual General Meeting
at Jayne's.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.335
Dad used to make us go
every summer

00:43.335 --> 00:44.879
and it drove Mom bananas.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.756
Derrick used to make you
go to AGMs?

00:46.756 --> 00:49.383
You don't just become Boathouse
president. You're groomed.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.052
I was framed!

00:52.052 --> 00:53.888
My fireworks should be
in this box, but they're gone.

00:53.888 --> 00:56.682
They set fire to the Boathouse.
That's how combustion works.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.517
Not today, science.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.519
They're gone because
someone took them out

01:00.519 --> 01:02.229
and started the fire

01:02.229 --> 01:06.400
after I took them safely outside
the Boathouse. Do you see?

01:06.400 --> 01:10.029
The box has been opened
and it's not even singed.

01:10.029 --> 01:12.031
There's an arsonist among us.

01:12.031 --> 01:13.824
Who would set fire
to the Boathouse?

01:13.824 --> 01:15.618
Believe the victim, Maisy.

01:15.618 --> 01:16.952
Not how that's used.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.370
Look, I need your help.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.456
I need your help
to unmask the arsonist,

01:20.456 --> 01:22.708
redeem my good name
and win back the man I love.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.335
Go to bed, Justin.

01:24.335 --> 01:26.045
Okay, but I'm the big spoon.

01:26.045 --> 01:28.214
Maisy's big spoon.

01:28.214 --> 01:30.090
Can we just send him to Madrid?

01:30.090 --> 01:31.467
They won't let him back in.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.344
The paella was laced.

01:37.515 --> 01:39.600
<i>♪ Baby I don't know... ♪</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:43.562
Hi. Riley, we're having
a conversation as two people do.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.397
I, uh, I need to tell you,

01:45.397 --> 01:48.067
I didn't burn down
the Boathouse. I was framed.

01:48.067 --> 01:50.486
Like people frame people.

01:50.486 --> 01:53.030
Oh my God, I sound crazy. This
is crazy. I'm a crazy person.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.281
Because he's not gonna
believe you.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.699
Forgivesies?

01:55.699 --> 01:57.326
My dad's gonna call
because I told him,

01:57.326 --> 01:59.078
you and Riley made up
and I'm staying with you

01:59.078 --> 02:00.621
giving nature tours
with Parks Canada all summer

02:00.621 --> 02:02.790
because my mom will freak if
she knows that I blew off

02:02.790 --> 02:04.333
the internship to plant trees.
So back me up

02:04.333 --> 02:06.126
and do whatever it takes to fix
things with Riley

02:06.126 --> 02:07.503
or my parents will never forgive
me. Okay?

02:07.503 --> 02:09.588
And the cherry on
my anxiety sundae.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.507
Just be yourself.
But do the opposite

02:11.507 --> 02:13.259
of every instinct
you ever have.

02:13.259 --> 02:15.094
Okay, gotta run. Love you. Bye.

02:15.928 --> 02:18.472
My God, I see more of me
in her every day.

02:36.574 --> 02:37.741
I come in peace...

02:40.202 --> 02:41.495
or pieces.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.792
You see this?

02:50.963 --> 02:52.798
Top wedding fail.

02:52.798 --> 02:55.217
Thanks to you,
I'm a fucking meme.

03:00.639 --> 03:01.473
I'm sorry.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.146
I'm sorry.

03:12.902 --> 03:14.403
You didn't deserve any of this.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.750
How's the patient feeling?

03:28.626 --> 03:32.421
Don't get your hopes up.
Miles away from last rites.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.506
I have all your favourites here.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.300
Cacao, chia pudding,

03:36.300 --> 03:38.177
mushroom tea,
and a triple-triple.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.638
Oh... No arsenic?

03:40.638 --> 03:42.348
No, I'm saving that for lunch.

03:43.849 --> 03:46.185
No, no.

03:47.645 --> 03:49.855
I do not wanna waste
any more time

03:49.855 --> 03:51.523
being mad about the past.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.776
Oh, sweetie,
that's wonderful to hear.

03:53.776 --> 03:55.277
So I made a list.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.821
Oh, of course, you did.
It's very Virgo of you.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.865
Of all our favourite
cottage things

03:59.865 --> 04:02.117
to do together before you,
you know.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.452
Walk into the light

04:03.452 --> 04:06.497
in a blaze of Quaaludes
and an '83 Clicquot?

04:08.540 --> 04:11.293
The... the Boathouse's AGM
at Jayne's

04:11.293 --> 04:12.670
is the perfect place to start.

04:12.670 --> 04:14.046
We really need to figure out

04:14.046 --> 04:15.547
what we're doing with
that Boathouse.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.800
Oh, I remember those.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.343
Flights to Singapore
were shorter.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.929
Should only take four, five,
maybe six hours.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.722
You cannot put a clock
on democracy.

04:25.391 --> 04:26.767
Will there be cocktails?

04:44.034 --> 04:45.452
Be right there!

04:46.453 --> 04:50.332
Hey! You found me. I was
gonna call search and rescue.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.959
Brought my own flares this time.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.044
Cute outfit.
The bugs are gonna love it.

04:54.044 --> 04:57.798
Oh, I doubt that because
I came prepared this time.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.009
Point Thunberg.

05:00.009 --> 05:02.886
So is there somewhere private
that I can change?

05:02.886 --> 05:04.179
Uh...

05:05.597 --> 05:08.308
- Is there somewhere else?
- Uh, Urban Outfitters?

05:09.226 --> 05:10.686
Point Ivy.

05:10.686 --> 05:13.313
There's not much privacy
in the bush.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.315
- Hope you're cool with it.
- Yeah, totally cool.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.694
Okay. We're talking
a lot of body hair.

05:18.694 --> 05:21.030
Like a lot. Not that there's
anything wrong with body hair.

05:21.030 --> 05:23.782
We are very body positive
around here.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.576
- Too positive.
- Hey.

05:25.576 --> 05:28.454
Oh, Jesus, Krusty Jake.
Please fix your sarong.

05:28.454 --> 05:30.039
Sorry.

05:30.039 --> 05:33.292
So what do you think?

05:33.292 --> 05:34.877
I think...

05:35.836 --> 05:38.172
Girl Guides
didn't prepare you for this.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.596
All right, people.
Let's dig some holes.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.389
Let's plant some trees.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.557
All right.

05:56.648 --> 05:59.276
This must be the longest
you've gone without talking.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.279
Well, Billie said
to do the opposite

06:02.279 --> 06:05.157
of every instinct I have, so.

06:05.157 --> 06:08.077
- You're dying inside?
- It's unbearable. Yeah.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.332
Are you sure
you're okay with her

06:13.332 --> 06:15.084
staying for the summer?

06:15.084 --> 06:16.960
Been nice having
her around, actually.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.214
We went shopping
yesterday for her gear.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.758
You guys went shopping
without me?

06:23.967 --> 06:25.594
Just boots and bugs stuff.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.137
Like cute boots and bug stuff?

06:29.890 --> 06:31.225
Why the face?

06:31.767 --> 06:33.811
Billie stayed like you wanted.

06:33.811 --> 06:35.354
Yeah, I mean,
she's staying with you.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.605
I wanted her to stay with me.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.275
That's on you.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.945
Ah, man. Riley, I...

06:45.155 --> 06:46.448
I don't know why I ran,

06:47.199 --> 06:50.160
but I know it's not why
the Boathouse burned down.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.079
I think that someone
stole my fireworks

06:52.079 --> 06:54.248
and started the fire
and I can't prove it.

06:54.248 --> 06:58.836
But I was thinking maybe
with your RKI smarts,

06:58.836 --> 07:01.547
and my good looks,

07:01.547 --> 07:03.340
we can get in there
and crack the case.

07:04.591 --> 07:08.846
God, your life should be
a fucking Bravo series.

07:08.846 --> 07:10.305
You know, that's so weird.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.141
I was just saying that
to Billie the other day.

07:12.141 --> 07:14.059
Oh, that's not a compliment.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.311
He has a baby in high school.

07:16.311 --> 07:21.692
Gives it up, comes out,
gets kicked out,

07:21.692 --> 07:23.944
moves across the planet,
dates a Hemsworth.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.445
From Coff's Harbour.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.573
Gets divorced,
comes home,

07:27.573 --> 07:30.534
defeats evil stepsister,

07:30.534 --> 07:32.411
and makes up with his kid.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.413
Redneck Riley was never
gonna be good enough

07:34.413 --> 07:35.622
for the Justin show.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.916
That's not true.
It sounds like a hit.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.879
I tried it your way.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.882
Spontaneous proposal,
shotgun wedding.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.554
But being meme-ed by
a bunch of side characters...

07:51.972 --> 07:53.473
that's probably what I deserved.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.225
That's not true.
Riley, that's not true.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.894
Riley! Riley!

07:59.146 --> 08:00.564
Riley, your...

08:11.867 --> 08:13.410
Okay...

08:19.249 --> 08:20.209
Okay.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.927
Good stuff.

08:29.927 --> 08:31.136
Good stuff.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.389
Oh, my God.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.892
Hey, Kombuch!

08:38.852 --> 08:39.978
How you holding up?

08:39.978 --> 08:42.147
Good, thanks.

08:42.856 --> 08:46.026
And, uh, thank you for
setting things up with Ivy.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.028
Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm happy to.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.158
- Thirsty?
- What? No.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.286
Oh yeah, totally.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.420
Care for some highballer wisdom?

09:05.420 --> 09:07.089
What?

09:07.089 --> 09:10.509
When you pound a lot of
trees, you're a highballer.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.262
When you do
whatever that is...

09:14.304 --> 09:17.391
- Lowballer. Got it.
- Yeah.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.351
It's okay. Couldn't plant
for shit my first season.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.894
How many summers did you plant?

09:20.894 --> 09:22.604
Two now.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.231
Got my first job
last year of high school.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.735

09:49.548 --> 09:53.176
Align your sapling
with the root,

09:53.176 --> 09:57.806
and you grip the trunk firmly,

09:57.806 --> 09:59.266
cut the bottom,

10:01.727 --> 10:02.978
plug the hole.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.804

another lifeguard.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.181

You listen here, all right?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.733
This is Jaynie's
first presidency

10:49.733 --> 10:51.777
and this Boathouse
is gonna be the tits.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.404
So I can't be working canteen,
snack bar,

10:54.404 --> 10:56.448
rentals
and putting out your fires.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.492
I not...
I didn't start the fire.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.202
Wayne, stop this.
There's an arson...

11:00.202 --> 11:01.745
You're outta here. Sorry, bud.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.247
Wow!
AGMs have really changed

11:04.247 --> 11:06.792
since Derrick was president.
This is gonna be fun.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.878
We can't discuss the Boathouse
resale at a frat house kegger.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.213
Well, thank God for that.

11:11.213 --> 11:13.632
Talking shop really dulls
the barbiturates.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.967
We don't drink at AGMs anymore.
Maisy's bylaw.

That bum needs more SPF.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.458
Jayne, how are we
gonna have an AGM in this?

11:48.458 --> 11:50.001

11:50.001 --> 11:51.503
Under your control.

Fun, this is Maisy.
Maisy, this is fun.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.847
I know fun.
I put the F-U in fun.

12:01.847 --> 12:05.183
The Boathouse is for families,
not sad swingers.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.352
Sorry, Janine,
my daughter's rigid.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.646
It's her Capricorn moon.
Negroni?

12:09.646 --> 12:11.189
Ah, no.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.233
Somehow Maisy picked up
the most boring parts

12:13.233 --> 12:15.402
of my late husband
when he took her under his wing.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.654
OMJeepies,
you're so right!

12:17.654 --> 12:20.031
Remember how Derrick got
so Shrek when he was Prez?

12:20.031 --> 12:21.658
He was not. Dad was...

12:21.658 --> 12:23.285
As stale as your biscuits.

12:23.285 --> 12:25.620
My biscuits have been featured
in Canadian Living.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.372
- Twice.
- I have copies.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.833
Well, I think your Boathouse

12:29.833 --> 12:32.294
is a big improvement
on the original.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.921
Even if the Hall Monitor
doesn't think so.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.090
- Come on.
- Oh, I shouldn't.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.969
<i>♪ I'm lethal
Better put me down ♪</i>

12:40.969 --> 12:43.847
<i>♪ For a flip another pound
For a I take another bitch ♪</i>

12:43.847 --> 12:46.308
- Hi, girls.
- Stalk much?

12:46.308 --> 12:47.642
Why aren't you answering my DMs?

12:47.642 --> 12:49.144
Are you verified?

12:49.144 --> 12:50.604
I'm gonna pretend
like that didn't hurt

12:50.604 --> 12:52.063
and that your approval
means nothing to me.

12:52.522 --> 12:57.152
Hey, I need
any photos or videos

12:57.152 --> 12:58.612
that you guys took
of my wedding.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.030
They're already posted, pyro.

13:00.572 --> 13:04.367
Well, do you have any unposted
or maybe some... some deleted?

13:04.367 --> 13:06.703
- They're in photo heaven.
- It's called the Cloud, Keri.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.163
Clouds are in heaven.

13:08.163 --> 13:09.789
You guys,
I'll take anything that you got.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.041
There might be
something on there

13:11.041 --> 13:12.667
that could help me
fix things with Riley.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.669
And I know you wanna see us
get back together, right?

13:14.669 --> 13:16.213
No, we just wanna see
Riley's OnlyFans.

13:16.213 --> 13:17.797
Yeah, that would be kinda hot.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.758
No, wait, just be an ally here,
would you? Come on.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.510
Well, then can you end
Mom's oldstravaganza?

13:21.510 --> 13:22.802
Or wormhole us to Tulum?

13:22.802 --> 13:24.596
Yeah.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.306
What if I could bring it here?

13:26.306 --> 13:27.849
Find you some cute F boys.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.310
- What?
- Don't go anywhere.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.441
Where's he
gonna find that?

13:37.567 --> 13:38.693
It's a thunderbox.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.196
Portable toilet.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.949
Dig a hole. Pop on top.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.534
- Make your drop.
- Oh, I...

13:45.534 --> 13:47.244
I think I can hold it.

13:47.244 --> 13:48.578
You drank four canteens.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.163
Yep. Nope. I'm gonna hold it.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.500
No, no, no, no.
Sorry, man.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.584
Oh, my God.

13:56.419 --> 13:57.629
Oh, sorry. Are you guys in line?

13:57.629 --> 13:59.047
- Mm-mm.
- Okay.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.467
He'll be done in a sec.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.350
<i>Quid fro-yo,
Billie Barnes.</i>

14:10.350 --> 14:12.602
<i>I lied to your parents.
So if you want me to make things</i>

14:12.602 --> 14:14.229
<i>right with Riley,
then I need you to send</i>

14:14.229 --> 14:15.272
<i>some gaggy tree-planter-
fireman-calendar-types</i>

14:15.272 --> 14:16.982
<i>over to Jayne's stat.</i>

14:16.982 --> 14:18.733
Hard pass on body musk
and white guys with dreads.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.485
Come on.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.571
I'll be there in 30.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.948
I...

14:24.948 --> 14:26.825
Wow! I'm good at this.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.451
Justin!
I know you're still here.

14:28.451 --> 14:29.369
Shit!

14:33.540 --> 14:36.001
- This is all falling apart.
- I know.

14:36.001 --> 14:38.628
The AGM was supposed
to bore my mom into leaving.

14:38.628 --> 14:39.879
How is this happening?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.131
I won three championships,

14:41.131 --> 14:42.757
but now I'm mixing drinks
for Wayne?

14:42.757 --> 14:44.551
And my mom is getting
along with Jayne?

14:44.551 --> 14:46.636
- Jayne can be fun.
- Fun?

14:46.636 --> 14:48.221
In a Jell-o shots kinda way.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.639
- I'm fun.
- I know.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.266
But your mom loves an audience.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.143
And Jayne plays
a great second fiddle.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.519
I did it one time.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.899
Well, if we can't bore her
into leaving,

14:59.899 --> 15:01.610
we can send her packing
by stealing

15:01.610 --> 15:03.320
the one thing she wants most.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.529
- Opal's kidneys.
- The spotlight.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.073
Oh.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.075
There's only
one person I can ask.

15:09.534 --> 15:10.660
Crazy-May.

15:10.660 --> 15:11.995
Bitch better buckle up

15:11.995 --> 15:13.705
because fun's a'comin'.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.166
What if Opal sees? If he sees...

15:16.166 --> 15:17.542
Tell him Mommy loves him.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.753
And then get him
the hell out of here.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.047
Let's Jekyll and Hyde this shit.

15:24.841 --> 15:27.344
Would you guys
just answer my texts?

15:27.344 --> 15:29.179
How is the foot box talking?

15:29.179 --> 15:31.431
Stay! Dad's still
looking for you.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.309
Okay.
But Billie's here.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.770
And she brought a DJ
for each of you.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.985
- I'm taking that one.
- No, I want that one.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.528
All right, now deal's a deal.
Gimme the footage.

15:46.655 --> 15:49.824
Yep, let's go.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.202
Yes!

15:55.664 --> 15:58.833
Oh, hey, Olive. Billie
brought a boy for you too.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.418
Oh, I'm sapiosexual.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.170
Oh, we all are, sweetheart.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.714
Until they won't shut up
about vinyl or Foucault.

16:09.427 --> 16:10.929
She's getting smarter.

16:10.929 --> 16:13.014
Uh-uh. You need life jackets.

16:13.014 --> 16:15.684
Oh, come on. Don't you have
a basement for that?

16:15.684 --> 16:17.686
- Ulrika!
- Uh-huh? Yes?

16:18.561 --> 16:19.729
Think of the children.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.648
That would be weird, no?

16:21.648 --> 16:23.900
The nude beach is supposed
to be on Wayne's half.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.360
Oh.

16:25.735 --> 16:26.778
- Hey.
- What?

16:29.364 --> 16:32.492
I know you told me to stay on
my side of the Boathouse but...

16:32.492 --> 16:35.328
we're outta snacks, beer, propane...

16:36.079 --> 16:37.288
and coasters.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.667
You can't get water rings
outta my coffee table, Wayne.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.419
They say that you can,
but you can't.

16:42.419 --> 16:43.962
Okay. And don't freak out...

16:44.963 --> 16:47.006
but I think I may have heard
Justin's voice somewhere.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.762
It's all going to dumpers.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.514
My first day as president.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.643
Okay.

16:58.643 --> 17:01.187
I'll send Victor on
a coaster run.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.565
Opal's helping out in the
kitchen, doing the best he can.

17:03.565 --> 17:06.401
And the girls are still
looking for Justin. Okay?

17:06.401 --> 17:07.902
We'll make it work, Jaynie.

17:08.445 --> 17:09.821
It's gonna be the best
Boathouse ever.

17:09.821 --> 17:12.699
Woo-hooo!

17:15.243 --> 17:16.494
Yes, girl!

17:16.494 --> 17:18.496

17:29.883 --> 17:32.343
But it's the best
I can do.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.137
Orpheus Protocol
like we practiced.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.430
Number one rule?

17:35.430 --> 17:37.223

18:14.677 --> 18:15.512
Yes!

18:16.596 --> 18:18.515
You two, move!

18:18.515 --> 18:21.935
Justin!
Get back here, Lovejoy!

18:23.478 --> 18:25.271
Don't mind if I do!

18:25.855 --> 18:27.315
My blindfold is slipping!

- Mommy.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.546
Come on.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.422
That's how you cottage, bitches.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.384
She didn't come with me.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.719
Oh! Drink! Oh! Drink!

18:56.719 --> 18:58.304
Hurry up.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.222
It's an emergency!

19:00.807 --> 19:02.517
Oh, thank God.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.311
- Is Wayne out there?
- No, gone.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.604
Coaster emergency
in the living room.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.231
Okay.

19:08.231 --> 19:10.316
Well, as much as I love
a potty party, I'm...

19:10.316 --> 19:12.443
Wait, wait. Stay. Please.

19:12.443 --> 19:13.903
Ooh.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.196
What's Riley feeding you?

19:15.196 --> 19:16.739
I've been holding it all day

19:16.739 --> 19:18.867
because tree planters
do their business on boxes

19:18.867 --> 19:20.368
in front of everyone.

19:20.368 --> 19:22.996
Justin,
there was this guy, pushing.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.998
The sounds,
the veins in his neck.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.750
Oh, my baby. It's okay.
It's okay. It's over now.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.669
No, you don't understand.
I have to learn how to go

19:29.669 --> 19:31.170
in public or I'll never
survive the summer.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.506
Or a bachelorette.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.426
I'm gonna be
right behind that curtain.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.177
Just don't look.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.347
Or listen. Or breathe.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.433
Okay.

19:44.559 --> 19:46.686
- Oh, and turn on the water.
- Already on it.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.897
Oh, God.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.775
Okay, Billie. You can do this.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.069
Oh my God. Come on.

19:57.155 --> 20:00.909
You can go in front of
your birth dad.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.249
The Boathouse is closed!

20:08.249 --> 20:10.126
Party's over.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.753
Get outta my house!

20:11.753 --> 20:14.881
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

20:14.881 --> 20:16.716
That means you too, Maisy.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.135
You can't kick me
outta the Boathouse.

20:19.135 --> 20:22.055
I made the Boathouse.
I am the Boathouse. Oh.

20:22.639 --> 20:25.266
See, this is why I hid all
the birthday invitations

20:25.266 --> 20:27.018
that came for her 'cause
she can't handle the sugar.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.811
I can handle it till sunrise.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.188
You'll puke.

20:30.188 --> 20:32.023
More room for the next round.

20:32.023 --> 20:34.776
Okay, Drunksy.
I think it's time to go home.

20:34.776 --> 20:35.818
Where's Victor?

20:35.818 --> 20:38.404
He ran like a weak ass bitch.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.740
Justin can take
her home.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.659
Oh, you pissed yourself,
Justine?

20:42.659 --> 20:46.371
No. And thanks to me, Billie
will never have to either.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.122
Wait, that sounds weird.
No, I... she...

20:48.122 --> 20:49.958
she gets bladder block
in public.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.793
Yeah. Not getting better, bud.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.378
Can you just take
your sister home?

20:53.378 --> 20:55.129
- She's not my sister.
- I'm not his sister.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.714
Ugh.

20:56.714 --> 20:57.840
All right, let's go.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.550
Oh. Oh, no,
this ain't over.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.970
I'll be back on the board
as soon as my mom kicks it.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.555
And my AGM's gonna kick
your AGM's ass.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.432
Settle down,
child. God!

21:12.271 --> 21:15.191
We can't host the Boathouse
at our cottage anymore.

21:18.194 --> 21:19.904
You said our cottage.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.123
I'm sorry I pimped you
out to the Barbie brigade

21:30.123 --> 21:31.833
so I didn't have to thunderbox.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.252
No, it's cool. The normal one

21:34.252 --> 21:35.628
hid me until
you finished your business.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.046
Oh yeah. Olive's cool, huh?

21:40.967 --> 21:44.303
Hey, what's the rush?

21:44.303 --> 21:46.556
Oh, well, Ivy already thinks
I can't cut it.

21:46.556 --> 21:50.727
And that was the longest break
in the history of breaks, so.

21:50.727 --> 21:52.979
Okay. Don't sweat it.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.939
Me and Ivy, we go way back.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.650
I could put in a good word.

21:58.735 --> 22:02.864
Wow. I mean, that would be,
like, super cool of you.

22:06.284 --> 22:09.412
So when you say you go way back,
do you mean like...

22:10.872 --> 22:12.623
- this?
- No, gross.

22:12.623 --> 22:14.333
Uh, Ivy's my sister.

22:15.626 --> 22:18.296
- Is that weird?
- Nope. No. Not weird.

22:18.296 --> 22:19.630
Not weird at all.

22:19.630 --> 22:20.965
Okay.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.427
We should go.

22:24.427 --> 22:25.720
Oh, my God.

22:27.263 --> 22:30.183
I need one more drink.

22:30.183 --> 22:32.185
- One more drink.
- No, no.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.270
You need a egg and cheese.
And you need a stomach pump.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.230
- Watch your step.
- Ugh! Just put DUI

22:36.230 --> 22:37.774
to bed with a bucket

22:37.774 --> 22:39.484
and she won't remember
anything in the morning.

22:39.484 --> 22:42.737
I totally broke
that kid's nose in Spike Ball.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.614
Oh, my God.

22:44.614 --> 22:46.324
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:46.324 --> 22:48.159
- Not for you, boo.
- What?

22:48.159 --> 22:51.162
Fine. Fine. It's fine. I'll stop
co-sleeping with you and Victor.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.289
I can... I can stay.

22:53.289 --> 22:56.000
I can only handle
one wildfire at the cottage

22:56.000 --> 22:57.835
and after what Opal saw today,

22:57.835 --> 23:01.380
I don't think
he's gonna let me stay here.

23:01.923 --> 23:05.510
Somewhere on this phone is proof
that I'm an innocent man.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.762
That you would all be
bar-b-que flambé

23:07.762 --> 23:09.555
if I hadn't run
for the hills. Stop!

23:09.555 --> 23:10.932
I'm a hero.

23:10.932 --> 23:13.267
And you're gonna feel so bad
if you kick me out

23:13.267 --> 23:15.061
when I'm the only reason
that you're alive.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.396
Sweet dreams, Justine.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.942
Wait. No. Come back. Don't...

23:20.942 --> 23:23.069
I don't have any place
else to go.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.362
Come on.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.365
I'm an inside cat.

23:36.415 --> 23:40.503
