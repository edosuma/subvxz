I could use a little power.

- Um.

05:22.736 --> 05:26.671

05:45.310 --> 05:46.553

- How have you been?
- Oh, for the last

05:50.108 --> 05:52.490
- twenty years you mean?
- Yeah, more even.

05:52.593 --> 05:53.870
Twenty-five maybe.

05:53.974 --> 05:54.871
- Twenty-five.
- Yeah.

05:54.975 --> 05:56.597
Imposs... Oh, no,
that's impossible.

05:56.701 --> 05:59.359

like, six leap days.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.395
Still good with the math.

06:02.431 --> 06:04.536

06:08.264 --> 06:09.748
You look good.

06:10.646 --> 06:12.855
You look... You look the same.
You look like you.

06:12.958 --> 06:14.063
You...

06:14.166 --> 06:15.961

- Yeah,

- This place, huh?
- Look at this.

06:24.901 --> 06:26.558
- It's busy.
- It's so, just, like...

06:26.662 --> 06:28.215
- Busy, busy, busy.
- ...so busy right now.

06:28.318 --> 06:29.596
My flight here
was packed, too.

06:29.699 --> 06:31.287
- Was it really? It was packed?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.564
- Yours?
- Today... No.

06:32.668 --> 06:34.497
- No? Empty, huh?
- Not packed. Not packed at all.

06:34.601 --> 06:35.602
- No. Not empty either.
- Wow! Empty?

06:35.705 --> 06:37.327
On the empty side-ish?

06:37.431 --> 06:39.088
- Ish. Empty-ish.
- Yeah. Okay.

06:39.191 --> 06:41.228
- Oh, God. Uh-oh.
- What?

06:41.331 --> 06:42.505
Do you hear us right now?

06:43.368 --> 06:44.300
I think so.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.750
Yeah, we're making conversation.

06:45.853 --> 06:48.753
It's small talk. I mean,
small talk is handy.

06:48.856 --> 06:50.893
No, no, we never used
to have to do that, Bill.

06:50.996 --> 06:52.170
- We didn't?
- No.

06:52.273 --> 06:53.930
- What's the alternative?
- Large talk,

06:54.034 --> 06:54.793
truthful discourse.

06:54.897 --> 06:56.588
Saying what we really think.

06:56.968 --> 06:58.452
- Oh.
- Bad idea.

06:58.556 --> 06:59.660
- Good point.
- Yeah.

06:59.764 --> 07:01.006
That's a good point.

07:01.110 --> 07:05.321
I guess, um, what I meant
was that, uh, we used to...

07:05.425 --> 07:06.771
We used to make fun
of the small talkers.

07:06.874 --> 07:08.117
We did? I don't remember that.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.877
Yeah, I remember that.
It's like that's what we did.

07:09.981 --> 07:12.570
I guess we thought
we were saying like,

07:12.673 --> 07:14.641
super important things
to each other or something.

07:14.744 --> 07:16.401
Like why is
Soundgarden playing

07:16.505 --> 07:18.576
only four dates
in Green Bay, dude?

07:18.679 --> 07:20.129
-  Yeah.
- The travesty.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.268
- Yeah, like that.

07:21.371 --> 07:23.719
- Just like that.
The Soundgarden travesty.

07:24.754 --> 07:26.618
Hmm.

07:27.723 --> 07:30.139
And now I don't know
what to say now that I...

07:30.242 --> 07:31.416
- Same.
- The small talk.

07:32.728 --> 07:34.005
Oh!

07:34.799 --> 07:36.386
- Hey, uh, W. Davis.
- Yeah?

07:36.490 --> 07:39.631
Are you on a trip
or on a journey?

07:40.390 --> 07:42.772
Um, trip or what?

07:42.876 --> 07:44.947
On this extra magical day,

07:45.050 --> 07:46.914
are you on a trip
or on a journey?

07:47.018 --> 07:48.502
You gotta remind me
of the difference again.

07:48.606 --> 07:51.298
Okay, so a trip is,
um, when you try

07:51.401 --> 07:52.644
to reach a destination,

07:52.748 --> 07:55.958
and a journey is when
you're trying to reach a goal.

07:56.061 --> 07:59.133
Like, um, serenity
or like mindful awareness.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.067
Mine is definitely a trip.

08:04.069 --> 08:05.070
Oh.

08:07.694 --> 08:09.419
- So, very nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.766
You have a connecting flight.

08:10.869 --> 08:12.112
I have a connecting flight.

08:12.215 --> 08:13.941
- Have a great flight.
- You have a good flight.

08:14.563 --> 08:16.703
- Exceptional to see you.
- Really.

08:16.806 --> 08:17.773

I'm really surprised

- I have it.
- 49, huh?

- What?

I never thought
of it that way.

- That's exactly right.

- I have the same complaints...
- You've been in your 50s

- Uh-oh, what?

10:12.025 --> 10:13.958
Yeah. That sounds
incredibly serious then.

10:14.061 --> 10:14.855
It is serious.

10:14.959 --> 10:16.546
I worry about everything.

10:16.650 --> 10:17.651
I worry about what's
gonna happen.

10:17.755 --> 10:19.273
I worry about what's
not gonna happen.

10:19.377 --> 10:20.447
Oh, like, what'll happen

10:20.550 --> 10:21.551
if your flight
doesn't get out?

10:21.655 --> 10:23.208
- Yes.
- What if you're stuck here

10:23.312 --> 10:24.313
talking to me for hours...

10:24.416 --> 10:25.417
Worried about
that most of all.

10:25.521 --> 10:26.936
Oh!
- Ah!

10:27.834 --> 10:29.042
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

10:29.145 --> 10:34.150
Right now, for instance,
I'm worried that we're lost.

10:34.254 --> 10:35.151
Yeah, probably.

10:35.255 --> 10:37.567
So it seems like
maybe we made a big circle.

10:47.198 --> 10:50.373
Boston. My friend Ginny.
Remember Ginny?

10:50.822 --> 10:52.513
- No.
- No. Oh, well...

10:52.617 --> 10:54.343
She's splitting up
with her husband,

10:54.446 --> 10:55.585
who is a divorce attorney,

10:55.689 --> 10:57.553
and they've got three dogs.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.693
And apparently, pets can
retain counsel now.

10:59.797 --> 11:01.108
So, it is so messy.

11:01.212 --> 11:03.076
Wait.
Pets have lawyers now?

11:03.179 --> 11:04.871
Yeah, yeah.
The world's kinda mad, Bill.

11:04.974 --> 11:05.803
Yeah.

11:05.906 --> 11:06.976
Well, you know
what they say about a dog

11:07.080 --> 11:08.702
that represents
herself in court.

11:08.806 --> 11:10.808
- No.
- She has a bitch for a client.

11:11.981 --> 11:13.120
You know, because that's like,

11:13.224 --> 11:14.743
they say anybody that
represent themself

11:14.846 --> 11:16.089
in court has a fool
for a client.

11:16.192 --> 11:17.711
- No, I don't get it.
- It's a play on it.

11:17.815 --> 11:19.195
Nothing's funnier
than explaining a joke.

11:19.299 --> 11:20.990
- So let me continue to go on.
- Well, it's lost on me.

11:21.094 --> 11:25.270
Anyway, I'm going there to do
a, uh, a cleansing ceremony.

11:25.857 --> 11:27.514
- Oh, hello.
- How about that?

11:27.617 --> 11:28.688
I bet you missed this.

11:28.791 --> 11:29.792

you thought or you think

it's all woo-woo bullshit,

11:34.452 --> 11:36.005
but it still makes
a lot more sense to me

11:36.109 --> 11:38.352
- than the stock market.
- I'm not a stockbroker.

11:38.456 --> 11:40.976
When the world goes
to hell, the market goes up.

11:41.079 --> 11:43.495
- What's that?
- Tension is good for business.

11:44.186 --> 11:45.670
That is my line.
You just said my line.

11:45.774 --> 11:46.809
- Really? Why?
- Yeah.

11:46.913 --> 11:48.708
"Tension is good for business"

11:48.811 --> 11:50.779
is my line
because I'm a masseuse.

11:50.882 --> 11:52.573
Oh, that's what you do now?
You massage people?

11:52.677 --> 11:54.783
I say it all the time. Yeah.
Tension's good for business.

11:54.886 --> 11:55.991
I do sound baths,

11:56.094 --> 11:58.131
- chakra clearing.
- Oh. Sound baths.

11:58.234 --> 12:00.478
Yeah, I'm a wellness practitioner

12:00.581 --> 12:02.791
in the healing arts.

12:02.894 --> 12:04.931
I think that's really great
that you never went

12:05.034 --> 12:06.311
like totally mainstream.

12:06.415 --> 12:09.383
- You stayed on the outside.
- Oh, yeah. Out of the box.

12:09.487 --> 12:10.626
- You weren't a cog.
- No cog.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.802
<i>Attention,

12:18.945 --> 12:20.878
<i>All other departure times

12:20.981 --> 12:22.327
It sounds like they're
trying to get a few planes

12:22.431 --> 12:24.571
- out before the storm hits.
- Yeah. I guess.

12:24.674 --> 12:26.815
I... I... gotta get out.
I got a meeting.

12:26.918 --> 12:29.576
Infant Kevin is just dying
for a reason to fire me.

12:29.679 --> 12:31.233
Oh, you've got a meeting.

12:31.336 --> 12:33.062
Well, I bet these guys
all have meetings too.

12:33.166 --> 12:35.409
- Don't point.
- The Executive Diamond Elite.

12:35.513 --> 12:36.652
Don't point at people.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.654
They board right
before the Nobel Laureates

12:38.758 --> 12:40.311
- so they have enough time...
- Don't point with
the rainstick either.

12:40.414 --> 12:41.622
- ...to get their problems...
- Please, Willa, stop.

12:41.726 --> 12:42.900
Don't point
with the rainstick.

12:43.003 --> 12:44.453
...into
the overhead bin.

12:44.556 --> 12:45.765
See, this behavior right here,

12:45.868 --> 12:47.145
- this behavior?
- Yes.

12:47.249 --> 12:49.423
This is exactly
why I loved you.

12:49.527 --> 12:50.666
No, it's not.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.047
- It is.
- No.

12:52.150 --> 12:53.842
It's also why we broke up.

12:58.363 --> 12:59.813
- What?
- Yeah.

12:59.917 --> 13:01.228
What? What?

13:01.953 --> 13:03.196
What was that?

13:04.335 --> 13:06.026
Well, I always wondered
why you left.

13:06.130 --> 13:07.372
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah.

13:07.476 --> 13:09.581
We talked about it all
before I left Madison.

13:09.685 --> 13:10.686
We sat in the back booth

13:10.790 --> 13:12.377
at Morty's over our fries
and beers,

13:12.481 --> 13:15.484
and we were very mature,
very civilized about it.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.003
Did a whole postmortem.

13:17.106 --> 13:18.798
Come on. You know that's true.

13:21.248 --> 13:22.456
No.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.044
When people break up,
there's the thing that

13:24.148 --> 13:25.356
they tell each other.
There's that thing

13:25.459 --> 13:27.427
they tell their friends.
And then...

13:27.530 --> 13:28.808
And then there's the truth.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.086
Which you never told me.

13:32.432 --> 13:33.847
And I never told you.

13:41.475 --> 13:42.787
Everything's pending.

13:42.891 --> 13:46.480
Okay. So, my behavior. Really?

13:46.584 --> 13:47.965
- What?
- Really? My behavior.

13:48.068 --> 13:49.483
That's the reason we broke up?

13:50.588 --> 13:51.520
- Incredible.
- Yes.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.350
Right. Okay.
So basically, my personality.

13:54.454 --> 13:55.351
Not the same thing.

13:55.455 --> 13:58.078
- Basically my personality.
- Okay, yes.

13:58.182 --> 14:00.425
Yeah. Well, that's,
this is not at all

14:00.529 --> 14:02.013
how I imagined our reunion.

14:02.117 --> 14:03.325
Oh, you imagined this?

14:03.428 --> 14:05.430
Yeah. What? You think we'd go
the rest of our lives

14:05.534 --> 14:08.433
and never see
each other again? Really?

14:08.537 --> 14:09.710
You didn't see me earlier?

14:09.814 --> 14:10.953
No.

14:11.057 --> 14:12.334
Huh.
- Why?

14:12.437 --> 14:13.680
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

14:13.783 --> 14:15.855
- No reason.
- Oh, my God.

14:34.839 --> 14:35.771
Hmm.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.428
<i>Attention, travelers,</i>

Rules is rules.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.520
What, so you're just...
you're not gonna sit

15:00.623 --> 15:03.385
- close to me?
- I didn't want to, you know...

15:03.488 --> 15:04.869
- Get too close.
- Well, invade

15:04.973 --> 15:06.526

15:16.950 --> 15:18.538
So, where in Boston
are you going?

15:18.641 --> 15:19.919
The old part, I guess.

15:20.022 --> 15:21.955
Ginny says
she has mature trees.

15:22.473 --> 15:24.095
Huh.

15:24.199 --> 15:25.683
- You've never been?
No.

15:25.786 --> 15:28.168
Where are you going
on your trip?

15:29.273 --> 15:31.620
- Austin.
- You are not.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.070
Yeah, it's my own fault.

15:33.173 --> 15:34.864
I demanded
a good, old-fashioned,

15:34.968 --> 15:36.176
face-to-face with baby Kevin,

15:36.280 --> 15:38.592
and he said, "Yes.
But remember this, Bill,

15:38.696 --> 15:40.663
"and this is not a reference
to the extreme difference

15:40.767 --> 15:43.356
"in our ages or should not be
interpreted as ageism.

15:43.459 --> 15:45.392
"But you got to level up,
brohim."

15:45.496 --> 15:48.119
What is stupid Kevin
even talking about?

15:48.223 --> 15:49.534
I don't know. And if you do

15:49.638 --> 15:51.226
what you always do,
you get what you always get.

15:51.329 --> 15:54.125
Well, okay, well,
that's pretty wise, actually.

15:54.229 --> 15:55.506
It's Tony Robbins.

15:55.609 --> 15:57.749
From Tony Robbins,
the self-help guy.

15:57.853 --> 15:59.303
- Yeah?
- Who was born on Leap Day.

15:59.406 --> 16:00.580
Don't ask me how I know that.

16:00.683 --> 16:02.823
- How do you know that?
- I took a seminar.

16:02.927 --> 16:04.687
- It was mandatory, though.
- Mm.

16:04.791 --> 16:06.034
I had to.

16:07.138 --> 16:08.588
You ever been to Austin?

16:09.071 --> 16:10.107
I have not.

16:10.210 --> 16:12.005
Well, be careful
down there, Bill.

16:12.109 --> 16:14.352
It's full of people
with my stinky personality.

16:14.456 --> 16:16.389
- You live in Austin?
- Mm-hmm.

16:16.492 --> 16:18.529
Of course, you live in Austin.

16:18.632 --> 16:20.013
Where do you live now?
Wall Street?

16:20.117 --> 16:21.256
- Yeah, right on the street.
- Yes?

16:21.359 --> 16:23.051
Yeah, right underneath
the statue of the bull.

16:23.154 --> 16:24.811
- Yes. Yes.
- No, nobody lives there.

16:24.914 --> 16:26.019
I live in Boston.

16:26.123 --> 16:28.435
North of Boston actually.
In the woods.

16:29.436 --> 16:31.128
- In the woods, huh?
- Yeah.

16:34.269 --> 16:35.477
What happened
to all your poetry?

16:35.580 --> 16:37.444
- You still writing poetry?
- Oh, yeah, poetry, right?

16:37.548 --> 16:39.619
- Yeah.
- That's a viable profession

16:39.722 --> 16:42.415
for a 21st century male.

16:42.518 --> 16:43.933
- All right, so forget...
- Raking in the bucks.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.212
Forget poetry, no money in it.

16:46.315 --> 16:47.420
Well...

16:47.523 --> 16:50.147
How about your songs?
You still writing songs?

16:50.250 --> 16:52.494
Well, I...
You remember my songs?

16:52.597 --> 16:54.185
Of course,
I remember your songs.

16:54.289 --> 16:56.429
- Oh, my God. Of course, I do.
- Wow.

16:56.532 --> 16:59.811
Yeah. Believe me...
I do what I can.

17:00.640 --> 17:01.779
I smoke a lot of pot,

17:01.882 --> 17:04.299
but I still can't
forget anything.
Not a single thing.

17:04.402 --> 17:06.025
I would have thought
you'd forgotten everything

17:06.128 --> 17:08.061
- about us, Willa.
- Oh, no.

17:08.165 --> 17:11.685
I... I remember
everything. Everything.

17:11.789 --> 17:13.549
All your big pronouncements.

17:13.653 --> 17:15.793
"Trust the poets,
not the politicians."

17:15.896 --> 17:17.381
- I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did.

17:17.484 --> 17:20.211
- No, I didn't.
- You absolutely did. You did.

17:20.315 --> 17:22.179
JFK said that,
and then I said it.

17:22.282 --> 17:24.284
- Okay. JFK said it first.
- All right.

17:24.388 --> 17:26.562
-"A man's word is his bond."
- I did say that. I said that.

17:26.666 --> 17:28.150
- I don't think I made it up...
- You used to say that...

17:28.254 --> 17:29.393
- ...but I said it.
- ...all the time.

17:29.496 --> 17:31.188
- I did. I said that a lot.
- And I believed it.

17:31.291 --> 17:32.465
Why are you shaking your head?

17:32.568 --> 17:34.122
Because I thought you were
a man of your word.

17:34.225 --> 17:36.538
- I am. How am I not?
- You left with no explanation.

17:36.641 --> 17:38.712
- What was Morty's?
- Confusing.

17:38.816 --> 17:40.990
Okay. So from one thing,
you misremembered,

17:41.094 --> 17:42.268
- you blow that up.
- Misremembered?

17:42.371 --> 17:43.545
Now that's
my whole personality,

17:43.648 --> 17:46.375
I'm untrustworthy,
period, with a capital "U."

17:46.479 --> 17:48.136
Yes, exactly. I just put
two and two together.

17:48.239 --> 17:50.483
Oh, did you? And got what, 87?

17:50.586 --> 17:52.105
You always sucked
at math, Willa.

17:53.417 --> 17:55.108
- Ouch.

17:55.212 --> 17:56.730
<i>Attention, travelers,</i>

17:56.834 --> 17:58.594

- You.

18:02.633 --> 18:04.117

18:09.571 --> 18:11.331
What are you laughing about?

18:16.267 --> 18:17.751

Not you. Sorry.

18:39.635 --> 18:41.154
Oh, no.

18:41.982 --> 18:43.122
Oh, no, what?

18:43.225 --> 18:44.778
Ooh! They're saying
this could be bad.

18:44.882 --> 18:45.952
Unbelievably bad.

18:46.055 --> 18:48.161
The storm of the century.

18:50.336 --> 18:52.476
Yeah, we're barely
into this century.

18:52.579 --> 18:54.271
So?

18:54.374 --> 18:55.720
So what, you think
we're going to blow

18:55.824 --> 18:58.275
a whole century's worth
of snow in one night?

18:58.378 --> 18:59.655
It's possible.

18:59.759 --> 19:01.726
Any catastrophic weather event
is possible these days.

19:01.830 --> 19:03.142
Where you been?

19:04.039 --> 19:05.420
Oh, God.

19:05.523 --> 19:07.905
Well, no. They're saying that
the full brunt might miss us,

19:08.008 --> 19:09.355
and there could be
a window later on

19:09.458 --> 19:11.219
where they get
a few flights out.

19:11.322 --> 19:13.566
Guess what? I asked Ginny...

19:13.669 --> 19:15.568
- Oh!
- ...to throw the I Ching

19:15.671 --> 19:17.294
for this trip,
and you want to know

19:17.397 --> 19:19.434
the answer she got back
from the universe?

19:19.986 --> 19:21.056
Not especially.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.471
"Deep waters in the heavens.

19:22.575 --> 19:25.888
"You must endure this dangling
and submit to the fates."

19:26.337 --> 19:27.821
"Endure this dangling."

19:27.925 --> 19:29.996
"And submit to the fates."

19:30.099 --> 19:31.653
Now, I remember Ginny.

19:34.794 --> 19:36.485
Oh, is that oil of newt?

19:38.107 --> 19:39.178
Lavender.

19:39.281 --> 19:41.352
You could use it.
It relaxes you.

19:42.698 --> 19:43.837
Oh, look at that.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.984
You need something?

19:53.088 --> 19:54.572
- A quarter.
- A quarter?

19:54.676 --> 19:57.989
Do they still have payphones?
I honestly don't know.

19:58.093 --> 19:59.543
You don't have a phone?

19:59.646 --> 20:00.475
No, of course...

20:00.578 --> 20:01.890
Of course, you don't
have a phone.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.029
Of course, I have a phone.

20:03.132 --> 20:06.584
Goddamnit. Of course,
I have a phone, but it's dead

20:06.688 --> 20:09.035
and none
of the outlets worked.

20:09.138 --> 20:12.245
And now I can't find
my charger.

20:12.349 --> 20:14.282
So, I'm officially
a woman with no power.

20:16.318 --> 20:18.803
Here. Use mine.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.050
1127. That's the passcode.

20:24.153 --> 20:26.915
Oh, hey. 1127, huh?

20:27.018 --> 20:28.537
- That's my birthday.
- Is it?

20:28.641 --> 20:31.747
1127.
That's my birthday.

20:31.851 --> 20:33.266
It's also an IRS form.

20:33.370 --> 20:35.751
My company liquefies
damaged assets,

20:35.855 --> 20:38.444
so I file a lot of 1127s.

20:47.418 --> 20:50.456
Oh, boy.
You still do that thing.

20:50.559 --> 20:52.872
You do that thing
whenever you're, uh, worried,

20:52.975 --> 20:54.632
or you don't know
how to talk about something.

20:54.736 --> 20:56.876
What are you doing?
I don't do that.

20:56.979 --> 20:59.154
- I don't know what you're...
- You do. You do.
What are you worried about?

20:59.258 --> 21:01.605
I'm just waiting
to hear from my daughter,

21:01.708 --> 21:03.365
that's all.

21:03.469 --> 21:06.644
Oh. Wow. Your daughter.
Happy for you.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.546
I've left her, like,
four messages,

21:11.649 --> 21:14.342
and she... she hasn't
answered me yet, so.

21:14.445 --> 21:16.067
Did you text her, too?

21:16.171 --> 21:18.242
Yeah. Yeah, I, I just...

21:18.346 --> 21:20.106
I just need to hear from her.

21:20.209 --> 21:22.488
- How old?
- She's 15. She's a good kid.

21:22.591 --> 21:25.284
But Beth-Anne, my wife, uh...

21:26.526 --> 21:29.909
We're... We're having a...
We're going through a...

21:30.496 --> 21:32.118
- Thing?
- Yeah.

21:32.221 --> 21:33.671
Yeah.
- Yeah, a thing.

21:34.223 --> 21:35.466
So...

21:37.503 --> 21:39.539
I just really need to hear
from my daughter.

21:40.437 --> 21:42.059
I bet you're a terrific dad.

21:42.162 --> 21:44.475
No. No, not lately, I'm not.

21:44.579 --> 21:47.202
I bet you are.
Did you apologize?

21:47.306 --> 21:50.378
Sort of. I sent a text, so.

21:50.481 --> 21:51.551
So you're halfway there.

21:51.655 --> 21:53.760
- Contrition, confession...
- Halfway where?

21:53.864 --> 21:55.693
The Sacrament
of Reconciliation
has four steps.

21:55.797 --> 21:58.800
Willa, I can't hear
this lightweight, new-age
bullshit right now.

21:58.903 --> 22:00.802
Oh, come on, W. Davis.
We got to do the work.

22:00.905 --> 22:02.976
You have to do the work.
Otherwise, nothing changes.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.875
Tony Robbins is right,
and then where are we?

22:04.978 --> 22:08.361
Willa, it was... it was
really nice to see you,

22:08.465 --> 22:10.536
but I've got a meeting
I got to prep for.

22:10.639 --> 22:13.746
- I gotta send some emails.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

22:16.783 --> 22:20.304
I really hope things work out
with your friend in Boston.

22:20.408 --> 22:21.892
- Thank you, Bill.
- And I wish that

22:21.995 --> 22:24.308
we could... we could
talk it all over again.

22:24.412 --> 22:25.792
As do I. As do I.

22:25.896 --> 22:27.449
- It'd be really nice, but...
- My deepest desire.

22:27.553 --> 22:29.417
There's not enough time
to revisit the past.

22:29.520 --> 22:30.797
- Not enough time.
- There's never enough time.

22:30.901 --> 22:33.041
<i>Attention,
passengers holding tickets</i>

22:33.144 --> 22:37.666
<i>on Boston flight 394
and Austin flight 279,</i>

22:37.770 --> 22:40.048
<i>due to weather conditions,
those two flights</i>

22:40.151 --> 22:42.084
<i>have been delayed
until further notice.</i>

22:42.188 --> 22:43.948
- Just those two flights?
- Just us?

22:44.052 --> 22:45.536
<i>Yes.
- </i>  That's unbelievable.

22:45.640 --> 22:48.297
- Unbelievable.
<i>Do not leave
the gate area.</i>

22:48.401 --> 22:50.852
<i>The situation could change
at any moment.</i>

22:50.955 --> 22:53.130
Ugh!

22:59.757 --> 23:01.414
I'm gonna grab some coffee.
I need it.

23:01.518 --> 23:02.622
Uh, can you watch...

23:02.726 --> 23:03.865
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- ...my stuff for a minute?

23:03.968 --> 23:05.107
Thank you.

23:06.074 --> 23:07.834
<i>Please see
a gate agent</i>

23:07.938 --> 23:10.423
<i>if you have
any additional questions.</i>

23:10.527 --> 23:12.114
I have so many questions.

23:13.253 --> 23:14.462
Ugh!

23:15.842 --> 23:16.843
Ugh!

23:17.844 --> 23:18.845
Ugh!

24:15.212 --> 24:16.696
Bill's phone.

24:16.800 --> 24:19.078
Uh, no, he just stepped away.

24:19.181 --> 24:20.355
Who's this?

24:22.495 --> 24:24.463
Oh, Beth-Anne.

24:24.566 --> 24:26.292
Hi, it's Willa.

24:26.810 --> 24:28.984
An old friend from Madison.

24:31.193 --> 24:32.781
Yes, 1,000 years ago.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.267
Um, we just bumped
into each other

24:36.371 --> 24:37.337
changing planes.

24:37.441 --> 24:39.339
There's snow delays, so, uh...

24:39.443 --> 24:41.756
Should I have him... Okay.

24:43.171 --> 24:44.206
Yeah.

24:46.381 --> 24:47.762
Sure. I'll tell him.

25:06.850 --> 25:08.886
Cream and two sugars.

25:08.990 --> 25:11.924
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

25:12.027 --> 25:14.340
- You're a good egg, W. Davis.
- Oh.

25:14.443 --> 25:16.100
You're a good egg.

25:16.204 --> 25:18.793
That's what my mother used
to always say about you.

25:18.896 --> 25:22.072
"That William Davis
is a really, really good egg."

25:22.521 --> 25:23.660
I always liked your mom.

25:24.281 --> 25:25.385
Somebody had to.

25:25.489 --> 25:26.835
Hmm.

25:28.457 --> 25:29.666
You put cinnamon in here?

25:29.769 --> 25:32.427
Yeah, I remembered
you liked it if they have it.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.187
And they had it, so.

25:40.435 --> 25:41.609
What's that?

25:44.197 --> 25:45.716
- You hear that?
- No.

25:47.338 --> 25:49.375
Rock and roll was church.

25:49.478 --> 25:51.584
It was rhythm, not algorithm.

25:51.688 --> 25:52.965
It used to have
blood running through it.

25:53.068 --> 25:54.656
Now it's just
a fucking T-shirt.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.003
It's a sad, sad,
bloody T-shirt.

25:57.107 --> 25:59.696
Yeah. That happened
on our watch, Willa.

25:59.799 --> 26:01.974
That happened while
we were not paying attention.

26:02.077 --> 26:03.769
Oh, yeah?
Well, what other lousy things

26:03.872 --> 26:05.046
happened on our watch?

26:07.082 --> 26:10.051
Gun violence,
ubiquity of plastics,

26:10.154 --> 26:11.535
the demise
of print journalism.

26:11.639 --> 26:14.469
- Anything good?
- I'm thinking.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.609
Oh!

26:16.713 --> 26:18.335
There have definitely been
good developments.

26:18.438 --> 26:20.440
- Like what?
- Instacart.

26:20.544 --> 26:22.201
- Instacart.
- It's undeniable.

26:22.304 --> 26:24.030
That's it?
That's what you got?

26:24.134 --> 26:27.240
Deny Instacart for one second.
You can't.

26:27.344 --> 26:28.897
What else? What else?

26:29.001 --> 26:31.106
The many advances
in sports medicine.

26:31.935 --> 26:33.592
- Hate speech.
- Farm to table.

26:33.695 --> 26:36.491
- War.
- There's always been war.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.699
Does not make it right.

26:37.803 --> 26:39.425
- Inclusion.
- Inclusion of what?

26:39.528 --> 26:41.565
- People.
- Exclusion. Cancel culture.

26:41.669 --> 26:43.394
- Black Lives Matter.
- Twitter.

26:43.498 --> 26:44.775
- The Internet.
- The Internet?

26:44.879 --> 26:46.156
Yeah. The Internet.

26:46.259 --> 26:47.709
- Internet. Internet. Internet.
- Internet. The Internet.

26:47.813 --> 26:48.986
- Are you agreeing with me?
- No, Internet bad.

26:49.090 --> 26:50.332
- Yes, you are.
- Internet bad.

26:50.436 --> 26:52.196
Electric cars. Vegan options.
They're all good, Bill.

26:52.300 --> 26:55.096
Are you plugging
your ears about me?

26:55.199 --> 26:56.787
No.

26:56.891 --> 26:58.720
Are you doing that?
- No.

26:58.824 --> 27:01.309
Oh, still a music snob.

27:01.965 --> 27:02.724
Oh, geez.

27:02.828 --> 27:04.761
Remember you used
to hide my CDs

27:04.864 --> 27:06.003
when our friends came over?

27:06.107 --> 27:08.178
Hey! When our friends
came over,

27:08.281 --> 27:09.282
you used to hide my CDs.

27:09.386 --> 27:11.181
One CD. One time.

27:11.284 --> 27:12.803
The Partridge Family
Christmas album.

27:12.907 --> 27:14.874
And I did that
to spare you the humiliation.

27:14.978 --> 27:16.704
Oh, so my taste in music
was humiliating?

27:16.807 --> 27:18.360
-  Yeah.
- Oh, yeah? To who?

27:18.464 --> 27:20.466
- To you.
- No, not to me. To you.

27:20.569 --> 27:22.330
To me. And to you.

27:25.678 --> 27:28.129
I can't. I can't.
I can't take it.

27:28.785 --> 27:29.786
- I'm sorry. I...
- Wow.

27:29.889 --> 27:30.890
- You can't...
- I can't take it.

27:30.994 --> 27:32.512
I got to get away
from that speaker.

27:32.616 --> 27:33.755
- All right. Okay. Okay.
- I got to go.

27:33.859 --> 27:36.102
Okay. Wait. Here. Here.

27:36.206 --> 27:38.001
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go with you.

27:38.104 --> 27:40.348
- Oh, okay.
- Here, hold this.

27:40.451 --> 27:44.663
How I end up carrying
your stuff, I will never know.

27:44.766 --> 27:47.010
Oh, more like
taking my stuff, actually.

27:47.113 --> 27:48.908
No, no, more like
taking our stuff.

27:49.012 --> 27:50.013
What is that supposed to mean?

27:50.116 --> 27:51.393
You left
with our record player.

27:51.497 --> 27:53.844
- Remember that?
- It was mine. I paid for it.

27:53.948 --> 27:56.536
You said you bought it
for us. That's the truth.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.124
You know,
looking back, W. Davis,

27:58.228 --> 27:59.885
I don't know
how good you were at sharing.

27:59.988 --> 28:02.439
Oh, I can't
believe you said that.

28:02.542 --> 28:04.855
- Why? What? Why?
- I had to share you.

28:04.959 --> 28:07.168
- What? Who?
- I had to share you.

28:07.651 --> 28:08.652
- Oh!
- Yeah.

28:08.756 --> 28:09.860
- Man, oh, man.
- What?

28:09.964 --> 28:11.551
- That got said.
- Yeah, it got said.

28:11.655 --> 28:12.621
Yeah. I'm gonna
pretend it didn't.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.658
Okay.

28:14.762 --> 28:15.970
- Remember the Pixies?
- Oh, you really are

28:16.073 --> 28:17.281
- gonna pretend.
- Yeah, uh...

28:17.385 --> 28:19.974
Remember the Pixies
at the Field House in Madison?

28:20.077 --> 28:21.734
Yeah, we sat in the front row.

28:21.838 --> 28:23.874
Yeah, same weekend
you got your tattoo.

28:23.978 --> 28:25.565
The following, but okay.

28:25.669 --> 28:27.567
- You were out of control.
- Was I?

28:27.671 --> 28:29.466
Yeah. Yeah.
You were just, like,

28:29.569 --> 28:31.019
- dancing like a wild man.

28:31.123 --> 28:32.572
Singing at the top
of your lungs.

28:32.676 --> 28:33.884
Man, that doesn't
seem like me.

28:33.988 --> 28:35.679
Yeah, that was you.
Remember you?

28:35.783 --> 28:37.785
- I miss that guy.
- Remember you, W. Davis?

28:37.888 --> 28:38.924
- No.
- Back...

28:39.027 --> 28:40.132
Back when you weren't worried.

28:57.149 --> 28:59.013
I see why you're
still so bad with numbers.

28:59.668 --> 29:00.739
Why?

29:00.842 --> 29:02.257
You keep them
in your shoe.

29:02.948 --> 29:04.225
Just the ones
I have to remember.

29:04.328 --> 29:07.331
- Oh!

29:08.954 --> 29:11.508
That's... fuck.

29:11.611 --> 29:15.236
Hey, um, let's...
Do you wanna
do that wallet game?

29:16.099 --> 29:18.239
- What? No. What?
- Yeah.

29:18.342 --> 29:21.069
We, uh, trade wallets.
That's the fastest way
to catch up with somebody.

29:21.173 --> 29:23.037
- I don't remember that.
- Yeah, yeah.

29:23.140 --> 29:25.177
- That's the fastest way.
- We have phones now.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.937
Yeah, but it's just
so much better than a phone.

29:27.041 --> 29:28.214
How's a wallet better
than a phone?

29:28.318 --> 29:30.044
You can't erase
the search history.

29:30.147 --> 29:32.184
Hmm.
- What's the worst
that could happen?

29:32.287 --> 29:34.634
- Oh, don't ask me
questions like that.

29:37.534 --> 29:39.191
Come on, W. Davis. Come on.

29:41.607 --> 29:44.299
Okay. All right.

29:44.403 --> 29:46.577
Oh, these are. They are?

29:47.578 --> 29:49.339
- Song lyrics.
- Oh.

29:49.442 --> 29:53.067
- Really?
- Uh, we can put over there.

29:53.826 --> 29:55.655
- Okay, uh...
- Ooh.

29:55.759 --> 29:57.657
I don't know how you do this.

29:57.761 --> 30:00.522
You always take
such incredible

30:00.626 --> 30:01.800
driver's license pictures,

30:01.903 --> 30:03.594
and I always look like
I just went camping.

30:03.698 --> 30:05.148
You do. Look.

30:05.251 --> 30:06.356
Oh!

30:06.459 --> 30:07.598
- Ooh!
- I totally do.

30:07.702 --> 30:09.635
- Sasquatch.

30:09.738 --> 30:11.533
But you were always fun
to camp with.

30:11.637 --> 30:13.673
You know, it's nice to see
your first name here.

30:13.777 --> 30:15.089
Wilhelmina.

30:15.537 --> 30:17.436
- Wilhelmina.
- Yeah.

30:19.058 --> 30:20.301
You know that you're
the only one

30:20.404 --> 30:21.509
I ever let call me that?

30:22.303 --> 30:24.477
Yeah? Wilhelmina.

30:27.101 --> 30:28.516
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:31.105 --> 30:32.692
What are you looking
for in there?

30:32.796 --> 30:35.178
Photos of the kids,
the family, the dog.

30:35.281 --> 30:36.800
Oh, no, no. You're not
gonna find them in there.

30:36.904 --> 30:37.870
- They're not in there.
- What?

30:37.974 --> 30:40.390
- No? What?
- No. No, they're not. Um...

30:40.493 --> 30:42.979
Lonestar consumer polling.
What is...

30:43.082 --> 30:45.844
I'll just take that.
Thank you so much.

30:46.465 --> 30:48.087
And, oh, hey.

30:49.951 --> 30:51.125
- Is that Beth-Anne?
- What?

30:51.677 --> 30:52.643
Yeah.

30:53.472 --> 30:55.370
Really? She's, um...

30:55.474 --> 30:56.647
Careful.

30:57.717 --> 30:59.133
She's very sensible.

30:59.236 --> 31:00.893
- Very sensible.
- Okay.

31:00.997 --> 31:03.585
- Is that your daughter?
- That's Rose. Yeah.

31:03.689 --> 31:06.243
Wow. Wow. She is a beauty.

31:06.347 --> 31:08.452
- Thank you.
- Yeah, she takes after you.

31:08.556 --> 31:11.870
Well, she's my hands free,
heart open.

31:13.423 --> 31:16.012
She's decided
she wants to be a dancer,

31:16.115 --> 31:17.358
which worries me.

31:17.461 --> 31:18.635
Dancing worries you?

31:19.636 --> 31:20.637
Dancing?

31:20.740 --> 31:24.227
I can't believe there are
no kids here, you know?

31:24.330 --> 31:27.471
Yeah, well, I'm part
of a lot of families, Bill.

31:27.575 --> 31:30.405
But your own. I know
how badly you wanted that.

31:30.509 --> 31:32.787
Right. But it just wasn't
in the cards, so.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.444
That's how I've imagined you
all these years.

31:34.547 --> 31:35.445
Home schooling your kids,

31:35.548 --> 31:36.964
- living off the grid...
- Oh, my God.

31:37.067 --> 31:38.897
...picking up all the strays,
the dogs, the cats,

31:39.000 --> 31:40.105
- the goats, musicians.
- Nope.

31:40.208 --> 31:41.278
Not in the cards.

31:41.382 --> 31:43.522
- What's this?
- Oh, can I have that?

31:43.625 --> 31:45.351
- Thank you so much.
- You know, you don't need

31:45.455 --> 31:47.491
your birth certificate
to fly, Willa.

31:47.595 --> 31:49.631
Wow. It really wasn't
what you said.

31:49.735 --> 31:51.219
What's that?

31:51.875 --> 31:53.601
That we wanted
different things,

31:53.704 --> 31:56.017
'cause all I wanted to do
was live in the woods with you

31:56.121 --> 31:57.225
and have babies with you.

31:57.329 --> 32:00.642
And you said that
wasn't the life you wanted.

32:00.746 --> 32:02.921
And here it is,
it's right here in your wallet.

32:12.482 --> 32:15.036
Willa, you're putting
it together all wrong.

32:15.140 --> 32:16.486
No, the truth is,

32:16.589 --> 32:17.970
you didn't want
that life with me,

32:18.074 --> 32:20.869
because of my personality,
it turns out.

32:20.973 --> 32:24.080
That's the truth.
That's what you never said.

32:24.183 --> 32:26.910
We worked, you know.
We worked so beautifully.

32:27.014 --> 32:28.981
- We did not.
- You had the answers.

32:29.085 --> 32:31.466
You steadied the ship.
You were ballast.

32:31.570 --> 32:33.089
Ballast. Yeah.

32:33.192 --> 32:34.918
The ballast keeps
the hot air balloon

32:35.022 --> 32:37.886
from floating too high
or floating away.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.474
- Ballast.
- You held the compass.

32:39.578 --> 32:41.545
That's how we were.
That's how we worked.

32:41.649 --> 32:43.789
Well, then we remember
it differently.

32:43.892 --> 32:45.584
We don't have
the same highlight reels.

32:48.414 --> 32:50.934
Your wife called.
Beth-Anne.

32:51.038 --> 32:52.039
While you were getting coffee.

32:52.142 --> 32:53.385
- I answered your phone.
- What?

32:53.488 --> 32:54.938
I'm sorry. I thought
it might be your daughter.

32:55.042 --> 32:56.975
- What did you say?
- Not as much as I wanted.

32:57.078 --> 32:59.080
- What did she say?
- She said she'd text you.

33:02.014 --> 33:03.119
Does Beth-Anne know about us?

33:03.222 --> 33:05.362
- What's there to know?
- Okay. Ouch.

33:05.466 --> 33:07.226
She knows that
we went to school together.

33:07.330 --> 33:10.057
That's how you described me?
I'm the girl that you went
to college with. Come on.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.368
- Willa!
- That's it.

33:11.472 --> 33:13.750
We had a life together, Bill.
We shared everything.

33:13.853 --> 33:15.303
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we did.

33:15.407 --> 33:17.340
We shared everything,
didn't we?

33:21.654 --> 33:25.313
She knows about you, okay?
You happy now?

33:25.796 --> 33:26.728
Ugh! She could have acted

33:26.832 --> 33:28.592
- a little threatened.
- That's not her style.

33:28.696 --> 33:30.042
All right.
What's her stupid style then?

33:30.146 --> 33:32.320
- Threatening. Not threatened.
- I don't like her.

33:32.424 --> 33:34.357
You don't even know her
the way I do.

33:35.496 --> 33:37.739
- Willa, where are you going?

33:37.843 --> 33:39.155
- Willa.
- I just need some water.

33:39.258 --> 33:41.122
Watch my rainstick, please.

33:41.778 --> 33:43.193
Willa. Willa! Willa!

33:43.297 --> 33:44.677
Shops are this way.

33:45.816 --> 33:46.921
Yes.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.303
And this is gate five.
Remember that, okay?

33:49.924 --> 33:51.339
Write it in your shoe.

34:00.969 --> 34:02.661
Write it in your shoe.

34:14.466 --> 34:16.088
<i>Press for questions.</i>

34:16.778 --> 34:18.332
<i>Release for answers.</i>

34:21.369 --> 34:22.474
Okay.

34:23.889 --> 34:25.960
Hello? Hello?

34:26.064 --> 34:27.755
I just... I, uh...

34:27.858 --> 34:29.412
My connection's all messed up,

34:29.515 --> 34:30.689
and, um...

34:32.070 --> 34:33.278
I don't wanna take
my flight anymore.

34:33.381 --> 34:34.762
I just don't want
to take my flight anymore.

34:34.865 --> 34:35.832
I just wanna go home.

34:42.459 --> 34:43.702
Hello?

34:43.805 --> 34:47.292
<i>Attention,
Boston passenger Davis,</i>

34:47.395 --> 34:49.811
<i>please report
to the rebooking counter.</i>

34:50.881 --> 34:52.469
Okay, well, where's the...

34:53.401 --> 34:55.507
Where's the rebooking counter?

34:55.610 --> 34:57.474
I'm supposed
to guess, I guess.

34:57.578 --> 34:59.097
<i>Yes.</i>

35:04.136 --> 35:06.000
- Ha!
- What?

35:06.104 --> 35:08.347
- Caught you.
- Yeah.

35:08.451 --> 35:10.177
Trying to get out
any which way you can, huh?

35:10.280 --> 35:12.386
- Yup.

35:12.489 --> 35:15.113
- Who does that?
- Me. You caught me.

35:15.216 --> 35:16.631
You can't endure the dangling?

35:16.735 --> 35:18.737
No, I can't.
Now that you mention it.

35:19.738 --> 35:21.049
Is there anybody here
who can help me?

35:21.153 --> 35:23.224
Did a quick
cost-benefit analysis

35:23.328 --> 35:25.882
about spending time with me
and my stinky personality?

35:25.985 --> 35:28.402
If that makes you feel better,
blaming me for everything

35:28.505 --> 35:30.749
and turning me
into a caricature, please,

35:30.852 --> 35:31.819
by all means, do it.

35:31.922 --> 35:33.579
"If agents are not present,

35:33.683 --> 35:34.994
-"please press for Betty."

35:35.098 --> 35:36.134
<i>How can I help you?</i>

35:36.237 --> 35:38.377
Betty!

35:38.481 --> 35:40.034
Hey, uh, thank goodness.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.898
I need to get
out of here. I'm stuck.

35:43.175 --> 35:45.246
- Hey. Hey!
- Um... what?

35:45.350 --> 35:46.351
Where's my rainstick?

35:46.454 --> 35:47.628
You were supposed
to watch that.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.285
Bill.

35:50.734 --> 35:51.597
Oh.

35:51.701 --> 35:54.773
Oh. Oh, a man's word
is his bond, right?

35:54.876 --> 35:55.670
Ha!

35:55.774 --> 35:59.605
Ha, yourself.
Because it's right here.

36:00.503 --> 36:02.677
Because I can be trusted.

36:02.781 --> 36:05.508
It is a hallmark
of my personality. Ha!

36:05.611 --> 36:07.475
Oh. Right. Your sterling self.

36:08.511 --> 36:11.134
Same old W. Davis.
Solid as a rock.

36:11.238 --> 36:12.308
Willa, whatever you think,

36:12.411 --> 36:14.137
whatever you've
convinced yourself of

36:14.241 --> 36:16.726
in that fairy forest
that you live in,

36:16.829 --> 36:18.590
you could always trust me.

36:18.693 --> 36:19.832
Always.

36:23.319 --> 36:24.458
I... I should have known

36:24.561 --> 36:25.700
we were all wrong
for each other

36:25.804 --> 36:26.908
once we opened up
the relationship.

36:27.012 --> 36:28.876
Once you wanted
to open up the relationship.

36:28.979 --> 36:32.155
- Why the fuck did I bring--
- Oh, really? Here we go.

36:32.259 --> 36:33.639
- Yeah, here we go.
- Here we go.

36:33.743 --> 36:35.400
You ever think about
what a bad idea that was?

36:35.503 --> 36:37.816
- How stupid that was?
- Listen, it meant a lot to me.

36:37.919 --> 36:40.232
It meant a lot to me
that you seemed okay with it.

36:40.336 --> 36:43.166
How many times
do I have to say that, huh?

36:43.270 --> 36:45.099
I was breaking
gender stereotypes.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.790
You were exploring
your sexuality, right?

36:46.894 --> 36:48.413
Yeah, well, gussy it up
all you want.

36:48.516 --> 36:49.483
The truth as much simpler.

36:49.586 --> 36:50.587
Oh, yeah? What's the truth?

36:50.691 --> 36:52.417
You wanted
to fuck other people.

36:56.559 --> 36:59.182
- I was 20.
- You were 25.

36:59.286 --> 37:01.357
Exactly. What did I know?

37:01.460 --> 37:03.359
And like an idiot,
I went along with it

37:03.462 --> 37:07.294
because I... I thought
that if you could sleep

37:07.397 --> 37:08.950
with anybody you wanted,
that you'd be happy.

37:09.054 --> 37:10.193
But you know what?
It's my fault

37:10.297 --> 37:12.126
because I...
I couldn't deal with it.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.818
What? What are
you even talking about?

37:14.922 --> 37:17.304
- You were so cool with it.
- Well, I wasn't.

37:17.407 --> 37:19.202
You were
too cool with it, Bill.

37:19.306 --> 37:21.100
- I wasn't.
- You lied about that too?

37:21.204 --> 37:22.343
I lied to myself

37:22.447 --> 37:24.932
because I was in love
with you, Willa.

37:28.107 --> 37:30.455
And, you know, I...

37:30.558 --> 37:33.458
I just found that
I couldn't turn that

37:33.561 --> 37:36.323
on and off like a switch.

37:38.152 --> 37:39.464
I know.

37:42.294 --> 37:43.916
It was unsustainable.

37:50.578 --> 37:52.304
Anybody could have seen that.

37:54.133 --> 37:57.067
And you can make believe
you didn't hear that, too.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.553
Hey.

39:11.556 --> 39:13.005
<i>Namaste,</i> asshole.

39:14.075 --> 39:15.111
Okay.

39:18.252 --> 39:20.047
Did you get rebooked?

39:20.150 --> 39:24.638
No. There's nothing going out.
It's a disaster.

39:26.916 --> 39:28.089
You mad at me?

39:31.921 --> 39:33.612
Are you giving me
the silent treatment?

39:33.716 --> 39:35.614
- Yeah.

39:35.718 --> 39:37.616
Even your silent treatment
is noisy.

39:37.720 --> 39:40.067
Oh, "Gussy it up." Really?

39:40.170 --> 39:41.931
Just so you know,
nobody says gussy anymore.

39:42.034 --> 39:43.726
Nope, not gonna take
the bait, Willa.

39:43.829 --> 39:45.693
If you had such a big problem
with it back then,

39:45.797 --> 39:47.074
you could have
just said something.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.869
We've already said everything
that needs to be said.

39:48.972 --> 39:50.388
Speak it. Oh, we? You.

39:50.491 --> 39:52.113
Hey, how about we just
get back to quiet time?

39:52.217 --> 39:53.321
That was nice.

39:53.425 --> 39:54.737
How about relax, man?

39:54.840 --> 39:57.118
You're already living out
your worst case scenario.

39:57.222 --> 39:58.119
What, being stuck here
with you?

39:58.223 --> 39:59.880
- Yeah.
- You make a good point.

40:01.191 --> 40:02.710
Making memories as we speak.

40:02.814 --> 40:04.022
Not gonna make
the highlight reel.

40:04.125 --> 40:06.645
Nope. No. Flush this one
right down the hourglass.

40:10.787 --> 40:13.411
Hey, just close your eyes,

40:13.514 --> 40:15.240
and reach in there.
It'll be a surprise.

40:15.343 --> 40:16.759
Ugh! You know,
I've been meaning

40:16.862 --> 40:19.555
to point out that Leap Day
was invented to reconcile

40:19.658 --> 40:20.935
the calendar every four years.

40:21.039 --> 40:22.074
It's not magic.

40:23.110 --> 40:24.214
It's math.

40:24.318 --> 40:26.700
- That's mean. That's mean.
- Science.

40:26.803 --> 40:28.253
<i>Attention, travelers.</i>

40:28.356 --> 40:31.394
<i>The National Weather Service
has identified the storm</i>

40:31.498 --> 40:33.292
<i>as a bomb cyclone.</i>

40:33.396 --> 40:35.122
Bomb cyclone?
<i>Yes.</i>

40:35.225 --> 40:37.676
We never used
to have bomb cyclones.

40:37.780 --> 40:38.850
No, they seem new.

40:38.953 --> 40:40.472
We had bombs
and we had cyclones,

40:40.576 --> 40:41.853
- but not together.
- I know.

40:41.956 --> 40:44.096
- Also, rain trains.
- Flash droughts.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.615
- Fire tornadoes.
- Fire-nados.

40:45.719 --> 40:47.445
- Hail hurricanes. Haili-canes.

40:47.548 --> 40:48.722
You're making
that last one up.

40:48.825 --> 40:50.448
- Oh, so what?
- Well, it's bad enough

40:50.551 --> 40:52.173
as it is without
you making shit up.

40:52.277 --> 40:55.487
You have a disturbing appetite
for chaos, W. Davis.

40:57.109 --> 40:59.180
<i>That was thundersnow.</i>

40:59.284 --> 41:01.389
- Thundersnow?
<i>Yes.</i>

41:01.493 --> 41:03.253
- Jesus.

41:03.357 --> 41:05.635
Okay, I'm gonna get
some real food

41:05.739 --> 41:07.810
because I need
to stuff my feelings.

41:08.327 --> 41:11.330
Okay. All right. Good idea.

41:11.434 --> 41:13.436
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go with you.

41:13.540 --> 41:14.610
Oh.

41:14.713 --> 41:15.956
What? Are you trying
to lose me?

41:16.059 --> 41:17.578
Yeah.

41:17.682 --> 41:20.408
Can you just admit that
no one pays you to do
the chakra thing?

41:20.512 --> 41:21.686
No. You might be surprised

41:21.789 --> 41:23.619
to learn that wellness
has become quite a cash cow.

41:23.722 --> 41:25.413
That is
a surprise development.

41:25.517 --> 41:26.691
Yeah, I'm surprised

41:26.794 --> 41:28.762
by how a lot of things
turned out.

41:28.865 --> 41:30.867
Notice how I don't ask you
what you mean by that.

41:30.971 --> 41:34.284
For instance,
I don't remember cats being
so universally adored.

41:34.388 --> 41:36.010
Ah! Humanity has
always loved cats.

41:36.114 --> 41:38.841
- Admit it, it's extreme.
- I won't admit that.

41:38.944 --> 41:40.187
I'm thinking, like,
ancient Egypt,

41:40.290 --> 41:41.464
statues of cats everywhere

41:41.568 --> 41:42.603
- and pyramids.
- No, no.

41:42.707 --> 41:43.708
Do you know what
the number one search

41:43.811 --> 41:45.848
- on the Internet is?
- Cats?

41:45.951 --> 41:48.436
- Porn.
- Number two is cats.

41:48.540 --> 41:50.577
Cats. Which is
exactly my point.

41:50.680 --> 41:51.647
No, no. You know what?

41:51.750 --> 41:53.338
I think that's
a search engine glitch.

41:53.441 --> 41:54.512
- I think...
- What does that mean?

41:54.615 --> 41:55.858
...men all over the world
are sitting

41:55.961 --> 41:58.170
in front of their computers,
typing in pussy

41:58.274 --> 42:01.173
- and sometimes they get cats.
- I can't even look
at you right now.

42:03.003 --> 42:05.005
- You make a good point.
- Yeah.

42:05.108 --> 42:06.593
Humanity has a...

42:06.696 --> 42:08.456
What are you, the spokesperson
for humanity now?

42:08.560 --> 42:09.872
I never said I was...

42:09.975 --> 42:12.702
Anyway, there couldn't be
just one spokesperson anymore.

42:12.806 --> 42:13.876
We're all so far apart.

42:13.979 --> 42:15.567
It'd be very cool
if there could be just one.

42:15.671 --> 42:17.155
You and I can't
even agree on everything.

42:17.258 --> 42:20.020
I mean, things
have really gotten
out of hand, W. Davis.

42:20.123 --> 42:22.781
Does every generation
feel like
it's failed the next?

42:22.885 --> 42:24.438
- Ah-ha!
- Ah-ha?

42:24.542 --> 42:25.922
Admit you think
the present is a big fail.

42:26.026 --> 42:27.683
That's not exactly...

42:27.786 --> 42:28.960
<i>Attention,
travelers.</i>

42:29.063 --> 42:31.514
<i>This is an important announcement.</i>

42:31.618 --> 42:34.862
<i>- Look up.</i>
- Wait, what'd they say?

42:34.966 --> 42:36.554
What if that's
important information?

42:36.657 --> 42:37.624
- I know.
- I know.

42:37.727 --> 42:39.004
What if we needed
to hear that?

42:39.108 --> 42:40.765
I know. It sounds
like stupid Kevin.

42:41.489 --> 42:42.629
<i>Look around.</i>

42:42.732 --> 42:44.700
Look around? Look around.
Look around where?

42:44.803 --> 42:46.771
<i>Look around.</i>
- I'm looking around.

42:46.874 --> 42:48.151
Looking around.
Looking around.

42:48.255 --> 42:49.981
- We are looking around.

42:50.084 --> 42:52.846
- Oh, hey, W. Davis.
- What?

42:54.054 --> 42:57.471
Cafe. Everything's going
to be all right.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.093
With all my might,
I ignore you.

42:59.197 --> 43:02.131
Come on, sir.
Let's move along.

43:15.282 --> 43:16.317
Uh-oh.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.390
- Uh-oh, what?
- Are you cheating?

43:21.460 --> 43:22.841
I don't cheat, Willa.

43:22.945 --> 43:24.705
Oh, that's right. I cheat.

43:24.809 --> 43:27.639
Yeah. I play the hand
that I am dealt.

43:31.470 --> 43:33.334
Hey. Hey!

43:33.438 --> 43:35.682
You wanna know the best job
I ever had, though?

43:36.337 --> 43:37.304
Not really. No.

43:37.407 --> 43:39.237
Spinning World Records.

43:40.307 --> 43:42.033
If you don't mind,
I've got a very important

43:42.136 --> 43:44.035
Wordle streak
I'm trying to maintain.

43:44.138 --> 43:46.209
Just one point
of clarification.

43:46.313 --> 43:48.039
You never worked
at Spinning World Records,

43:48.142 --> 43:50.179
- all right?
- Oh, wrong again.

43:50.282 --> 43:51.559
After you left Madison,

43:51.663 --> 43:54.666
I marched right in there
and I talked to Brad.

43:54.770 --> 43:56.634
- Brad with the huge teeth?
- That's right.

43:56.737 --> 43:58.601
That's exactly right.
And I pretended to be you.

43:58.705 --> 44:02.018
I held forth, you know,
on Radiohead, Devo,

44:02.122 --> 44:03.882
and I even quoted
that guy Bangs.

44:03.986 --> 44:05.884
- You quoted Lester Bangs?
- Mm-hmm.

44:05.988 --> 44:08.404
No wonder he hired you.
He's pretentious.

44:11.545 --> 44:14.686
Was Felicia still there
when you were working there?

44:14.790 --> 44:17.206
Oh, yeah, Felicia.

44:17.309 --> 44:18.863
- Yeah.
- Right.

44:18.966 --> 44:21.003
Yeah. You know what? She did.

44:21.106 --> 44:23.937
She was. She was
still working there. Mm-hmm.

44:24.040 --> 44:25.835
Huh.
Incredible girl.

44:25.939 --> 44:27.941
Yeah, incredible.

44:29.701 --> 44:31.289
Got to be amazing friends.

44:31.392 --> 44:33.049
- You did?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

44:33.878 --> 44:35.051
She's the one who suggested

44:35.155 --> 44:37.433
that I do massage work
on the road.

44:37.536 --> 44:38.883
- She did?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

44:38.986 --> 44:40.470
- And you did? You did.
- Oh, I did. Mm-hmm.

44:40.574 --> 44:42.783
That's cool.

44:42.887 --> 44:45.993
Yeah, I did that
for a few bands.

44:46.097 --> 44:47.408
And I did it for years.

44:49.859 --> 44:51.136
What bands?

44:51.654 --> 44:52.931
Well, you know,

44:53.932 --> 44:56.141
bands that were
incredibly popular

44:56.245 --> 44:58.972
and in my opinion,
incredibly talented.

44:59.075 --> 45:01.733
So, probably bands
that you hated.

45:01.837 --> 45:03.977
- Not the Dave Matthews Band.
- Oh, yeah.

45:04.909 --> 45:07.152
- Ow!
- Mm-mm.

45:08.153 --> 45:09.154
- Uh.
- Yeah.

45:09.258 --> 45:11.743
Well, the whole thing
was really perfect for me

45:11.847 --> 45:13.883
because if you ever want
to be absolutely sure,

45:13.987 --> 45:15.713
you're not the center
of somebody's universe...

45:15.816 --> 45:17.645
- Yes. What?
- ...date a musician.

45:17.749 --> 45:20.890
Okay. Okay. Okay.

45:22.512 --> 45:24.652
Oh, damn it. Shit.

45:24.756 --> 45:26.862
Uh-oh.
Still not your daughter?

45:26.965 --> 45:29.416
Just a point of clarification.

45:29.519 --> 45:30.555
- Yeah.
- The "uh-oh,"

45:30.658 --> 45:31.729
it's a complete misdirect...

45:31.832 --> 45:32.833
- Why?
- ...because when you're

45:32.937 --> 45:34.007
just saying, "Oh,"
but you put the...

45:34.110 --> 45:35.215
you're always putting
the "uh" in front of it,

45:35.318 --> 45:36.803
- so it's "uh-oh."
- I don't do that.

45:36.906 --> 45:38.874
- It just triggers
my anticipatory anxiety...
- I'm sorry. Okay...

45:38.977 --> 45:39.978
...because I feel like
it's gonna to be

45:40.082 --> 45:41.600
a very negative thing.
"Uh-oh."

45:41.704 --> 45:42.809
But you're just saying, "Oh."

45:42.912 --> 45:44.880
- So, no "uh"? Only "oh."
- No "uh." Just "oh."

45:44.983 --> 45:46.191
- Can you do that?
- Okay. Yes, I can do that.

45:46.295 --> 45:47.675
No "uh." Just "oh."
It's pretty simple.

45:47.779 --> 45:49.194
I think you should
just talk about it.
W. Davis, come on.

45:49.298 --> 45:51.749
- What?
- It's very healthy for you.

45:51.852 --> 45:53.785
See, it will clear up
your fifth chakra.

45:53.889 --> 45:55.028
I don't want to hear
this fifth chakra

45:55.131 --> 45:56.098
- bullshit right now.
- Which I think is exactly

45:56.201 --> 45:57.202
what's wrong with your neck.

45:57.306 --> 45:58.859
- Whatever chakra.
- Where are you going?

45:58.963 --> 46:02.138
Fifth chakra. Fourth chakra.
Fuck you chakra.

46:02.967 --> 46:04.175
Fuck you chakra.

46:04.278 --> 46:05.624
I do not want to hear
any chakra bullshit.

46:05.728 --> 46:08.282
Oh, yes, please. Let's stop
with the bullshit right now.

46:08.386 --> 46:10.768
How about that, okay?
I'll go first.

46:10.871 --> 46:13.494
I admit that
I'm not exactly riding high

46:13.598 --> 46:14.875
on the old woo-woo cash cow.

46:14.979 --> 46:16.187
What does that even mean?

46:16.290 --> 46:19.397
Lonestar Consumer Data,
the thing in my wallet?

46:19.500 --> 46:23.228
Product polling. I admit
I'm a product poller, okay?

46:23.332 --> 46:25.783
I am the phone call
that nobody wants.

46:25.886 --> 46:27.750
Well, consumer polling
is very important

46:27.854 --> 46:28.958
to the health of any business.

46:29.062 --> 46:31.305
Oh, come on. No, stop that.
It's your turn.

46:31.409 --> 46:32.168
My turn for what?

46:32.272 --> 46:33.963
Your cards on the table.
You promised.

46:34.067 --> 46:36.586
- What did I promise? When?
- You did just before.

46:36.690 --> 46:38.278
I didn't promise anything.

46:38.381 --> 46:40.004
- It's too much to get into...
- Oh, there you go.
Promise one thing, do...

46:40.107 --> 46:41.488
You wanna suffer in silence,

46:41.591 --> 46:42.834
- just go ahead.
What did I promise?

46:42.938 --> 46:45.837
- What did I say?
- You said no more bullshit.

46:45.941 --> 46:47.943
<i>Another gentle reminder.</i>

46:48.046 --> 46:49.772
<i>Please check your connections.</i>

46:49.876 --> 46:51.532
Yes, I said
something like that.

46:51.636 --> 46:53.534
Something like that.
Okay. Okay.

46:53.638 --> 46:54.984
Okay. You're conceding
the point?

46:56.089 --> 46:58.091
I'm saying I said
something like that.

46:59.299 --> 47:00.990
Well, that's
an impressive thing

47:01.094 --> 47:02.302
about you, W. Davis.

47:02.405 --> 47:04.994
I hate to admit it.
You do know when you're wrong.

47:05.961 --> 47:07.825
Yes, one of us does.

47:08.964 --> 47:10.828
When Rosie was little,
we'd sometimes have

47:10.931 --> 47:13.244
this thing she called
"A bad bye."

47:13.347 --> 47:16.143
I'd drop her off at preschool,

47:16.247 --> 47:17.973
and I'd say, "Goodbye, Rosie.
Say goodbye."

47:18.076 --> 47:19.112
But she didn't
want me to leave.

47:19.215 --> 47:20.665
So she'd say, "It's not
a goodbye, Daddy.

47:20.768 --> 47:22.632
"It's a bad bye.
It's a bad bye."

47:22.736 --> 47:24.151
- Right?

47:24.255 --> 47:26.360
So we had one
of those last night.

47:27.810 --> 47:29.812
I was rushing around,
you know, packing,

47:29.916 --> 47:31.193
trying to get ready
for this meeting

47:31.296 --> 47:33.264
'cause stupid Kevin rescheduled
at the last minute.

47:33.367 --> 47:36.715
I'm gonna miss Rosie's
big winter dance recital.

47:36.819 --> 47:38.234
And she's going on
and on, Rosie is,

47:38.338 --> 47:40.029
about these new classes
she wants to take,

47:40.133 --> 47:41.720
which are really far away,

47:41.824 --> 47:43.308
have to drive there
at a bad time of day

47:43.412 --> 47:45.310
and expensive,
and everything, you know?

47:46.829 --> 47:48.417
I'm listening,
and then she goes...

47:49.349 --> 47:51.040
Ah! She says,

47:51.144 --> 47:52.973
"Dad, I'm gonna be
a professional dancer."

47:54.595 --> 47:56.666
Which is nice, right?
But she's not that good.

47:56.770 --> 47:59.117
I hate to say it.
She's not gifted.

47:59.221 --> 48:01.948
Whatever "it" is,
she doesn't have it.

48:02.051 --> 48:03.432
And I'm thinking, you know,

48:03.535 --> 48:06.538
maybe it's time
for her to grow up a little.

48:06.642 --> 48:08.816
Maybe it's a teaching moment.
She can handle the truth.

48:08.920 --> 48:13.028
She's old enough.
So I stupidly say,

48:15.099 --> 48:16.065
"Do you know how hard it is

48:16.169 --> 48:18.447
"to become
a professional dancer?"

48:18.550 --> 48:21.381
"Do you know
the odds are astronomical?"

48:21.484 --> 48:24.211
"And even if you do make it
when you're 30,

48:24.315 --> 48:25.730
"your body's all busted up

48:25.833 --> 48:26.765
"and you gotta find
a new career."

48:26.869 --> 48:28.940
Full catastrophe mode, right?

48:30.045 --> 48:31.425
Father of the year.

48:33.255 --> 48:36.430
And she looks at me
and she says,

48:36.534 --> 48:39.709
"But, Dad, you told me
I can do anything."

48:44.818 --> 48:46.026
Ouch.

48:46.578 --> 48:47.579
Yeah.

48:48.891 --> 48:50.341
So I went into her room
this morning

48:50.444 --> 48:52.308
to give her a kiss goodbye,
you know?

48:53.620 --> 48:57.451
And all her dance clothes,
her dance bag, her shoes,

48:57.555 --> 48:59.039
in the trash.

49:00.247 --> 49:01.283
What if she just tried?

49:01.386 --> 49:02.836
What's the worst
that could happen?

49:02.940 --> 49:04.803
She gets her heart broken,

49:04.907 --> 49:06.150
doesn't leave
her room for years,

49:06.253 --> 49:07.461
and we have to
slide her meals in

49:07.565 --> 49:08.876
- through a flap in the door.

49:08.980 --> 49:13.881
No. Or she's Boston Ballet's
youngest ever prima ballerina.

49:13.985 --> 49:15.987
- No. No, no, no.
- No? No?

49:16.091 --> 49:19.404
Okay. Maybe she, uh,
teaches preschoolers

49:19.508 --> 49:20.578
and she loves it.

49:22.683 --> 49:24.685
Yeah, maybe. Maybe.

49:26.204 --> 49:27.585
I just want her to be happy.

49:28.931 --> 49:31.244
- Are you happy?
- Of course not.

49:31.347 --> 49:34.074
And you handle it.
Kind of.

49:34.178 --> 49:37.491
She'll handle it, too.
It's up to her to figure out.

49:38.147 --> 49:39.355
She'll do it her way.

49:52.230 --> 49:53.991
I have a good life all in all,

49:54.094 --> 49:57.442
but I... I don't have... this.

49:59.168 --> 50:00.825
And I have thought
about running into you,

50:00.928 --> 50:03.172
about seeing you again.

50:03.276 --> 50:05.485
What if we passed
right by each other

50:05.588 --> 50:07.625
in some other city,
and we didn't even notice?

50:11.974 --> 50:13.320
Have you, um...

50:15.253 --> 50:16.772
Have you ever wondered
what if?

50:17.635 --> 50:18.601
"What if" what?

50:19.671 --> 50:20.845
What if you hadn't left?

50:20.948 --> 50:23.020
And what if we hadn't
lost the baby?

50:26.816 --> 50:27.886
We were just kids.

50:27.990 --> 50:29.267
I mean, we were broke
and in school, so.

50:29.371 --> 50:32.305
Yeah. Right. I know.
I know.

50:32.408 --> 50:35.066
It... It couldn't have
worked out anyway.

50:35.170 --> 50:36.550
We were...

50:36.654 --> 50:39.174
It was unsustainable.

50:41.383 --> 50:43.523
Unsustainable. That's right.

50:44.972 --> 50:47.285
But a miscarriage, though.

50:47.389 --> 50:50.081
It was terrible.
It was really...

50:52.911 --> 50:54.982
We were just kids.

50:55.086 --> 50:58.296
Yeah, we were kids.
It was terrible.

51:01.334 --> 51:04.682
But I have wondered,
you know,
all this time that

51:04.785 --> 51:06.960
after a while, you seemed...

51:07.064 --> 51:07.995
you seemed relieved.

51:08.099 --> 51:09.652
And I wondered if...

51:09.756 --> 51:12.276
Was that because
you didn't have
to commit to me?

51:12.379 --> 51:13.656
I mean, you can just...

51:44.446 --> 51:46.310
I remember you singing
to my big belly

51:46.413 --> 51:49.554
and we thought we saw
her smile on the sonogram?

51:51.453 --> 51:53.179
- Remember?
- Yeah.

51:54.387 --> 51:56.492
Your smile
on another little face.

51:57.769 --> 51:58.805
Yeah.

52:10.472 --> 52:11.749
And then when they...

52:13.199 --> 52:16.167
When they said we lost her
and, um...

52:18.307 --> 52:20.378
that the life we made
would not be born...

52:20.482 --> 52:23.209
God, I still remember
that feeling.

52:23.312 --> 52:26.177
I was overwhelmed
with love for you, W. Davis.

52:28.800 --> 52:30.699
I knew you were
out there in the lobby

52:30.802 --> 52:32.010
as solid as a rock.

52:32.114 --> 52:33.771
And as sad as I was...

52:36.670 --> 52:38.258
I thought my heart would
close forever,

52:38.362 --> 52:41.158
but instead it opened
even bigger for you.

52:58.899 --> 53:00.280
Cards on the table, right?

53:04.595 --> 53:05.596
Sure.

53:07.218 --> 53:08.392
Um...

53:08.495 --> 53:11.602
The birth certificate
that was in my wallet, uh...

53:14.570 --> 53:16.227
A while after
you left Madison,

53:16.331 --> 53:17.608
I had a little girl,

53:18.436 --> 53:20.990
and I gave her up
for adoption.

53:24.649 --> 53:25.616
And it's hers.

53:29.861 --> 53:31.863
As soon as we found out
we were expecting,

53:31.967 --> 53:33.348
the dad left.

53:34.487 --> 53:38.387
No explanation,
but easy to guess, right?

53:38.491 --> 53:39.940
He was a bass player

53:40.044 --> 53:43.979
and I wasn't the center
of his universe either, so.

53:45.808 --> 53:46.775
Anyway...

53:48.915 --> 53:52.436
The, uh, really good news
is that I found

53:52.539 --> 53:53.644
the perfect parents for her.

53:53.747 --> 53:56.819
Or they found me,
or they found my little girl.

53:56.923 --> 53:58.994
I don't know how the universe
works that out,

53:59.097 --> 54:00.271
but it does.

54:05.311 --> 54:06.726
Do you know where she is now?

54:11.248 --> 54:12.421
No.

54:25.814 --> 54:27.816
<i>Time will tell...</i>

54:42.244 --> 54:44.729
Wow, you changed.

54:45.972 --> 54:47.594
Not enough.

54:48.457 --> 54:50.701
Yeah, I was... I... I saw
a bar open down there

54:50.804 --> 54:52.979
and somebody
handed me one of these, so.

54:53.082 --> 54:54.774
- Oh.
- Hotel voucher.

54:54.877 --> 54:56.016
Oh, hey. Lucky you.

54:56.603 --> 54:59.710
Yep, lucky me.

54:59.813 --> 55:04.715
Yeah, I... I did see you,
um, like, a year ago. April.

55:04.818 --> 55:08.339
You were... You were changing
planes in Dallas.

55:09.616 --> 55:11.998
- Why didn't you say anything?
- What would I have said?

55:12.101 --> 55:15.381
- Same thing you said today.
- I couldn't, um...

55:15.484 --> 55:18.315
There's something
about the way you were walking

55:18.418 --> 55:20.558
with your head
up high. I just...

55:20.662 --> 55:22.698
- Today was different?
- Yeah.

55:23.665 --> 55:24.942
Today you looked
a little lost.

55:26.564 --> 55:29.429
Well, you know,
I'm always lost.

55:29.981 --> 55:31.120
I could be wrong.

55:32.259 --> 55:34.676
I've been wrong
about you before,

55:34.779 --> 55:35.815
plenty of times.

55:39.197 --> 55:40.371
Come here.

55:42.200 --> 55:43.478
Um...

55:43.581 --> 55:45.307
- Come on. Give me that.
- I don't know if it comes off.

55:45.411 --> 55:47.309
- Why don't you take this?

55:47.413 --> 55:48.483
- You take this.
- Oh, no.

55:48.586 --> 55:50.036
- How about that?
- Where would you sleep?

55:50.139 --> 55:51.209
Maybe they got two rooms.

55:51.313 --> 55:52.521
Maybe they got
a room with two beds.

55:52.625 --> 55:54.834
I mean,
it's a pretty nice hotel.

55:54.937 --> 55:57.595
- Complimentary shuttle.
- Is that what it says?

55:57.699 --> 56:00.011
Yes, it's a shuttle that
compliments you.

56:00.115 --> 56:01.081
Oh, like...

56:01.185 --> 56:02.738
You get on and it says,
"Have you lost weight?

56:02.842 --> 56:04.982
-"I barely felt you get on."

56:08.744 --> 56:10.505
Just hang up.
- No. No.

56:10.608 --> 56:12.714
- Just... Just hang up.
- No, it's rude.

56:12.817 --> 56:13.680
No, it's not.

56:13.784 --> 56:15.164
You can't let
customer service beat you.

56:15.268 --> 56:16.200
Sure, you can.

56:16.303 --> 56:17.822
- No, you can't.
- Yes, you can.

56:17.926 --> 56:19.893
- Ooh. What's that face?

56:19.997 --> 56:22.482
The on-hold music.
It's punishing.

56:23.172 --> 56:25.692
It's a tuba, a piccolo...

56:26.313 --> 56:27.349
and a clavinet?

56:27.453 --> 56:30.732
- On what?
- Pearl Jam. <i>Daughter.</i>

56:32.009 --> 56:32.941
- No! No!
- Yes!

56:33.044 --> 56:34.114
- Just hang up the phone.
- No. No. No.

56:34.218 --> 56:35.322
- Hang that-- I'll do it.
- No. Yes.

56:35.426 --> 56:36.427
- I'm gonna hang up.
- No.

56:36.531 --> 56:38.084
- Just hang up.
- Oh, hey, hey, hey. Hello?

56:38.187 --> 56:39.637
No, no.
Yes, I'm here. I'm here.

56:39.741 --> 56:42.571
And I'm compelled to point out
that your music is an outrage.

56:42.675 --> 56:43.607
It is a sacrilege.

56:43.710 --> 56:45.367
I am serious about that.

56:45.471 --> 56:47.334
Yes, Adam. I have a...
What's that?

56:47.438 --> 56:49.613
Adam? Adam you're saying?

56:49.716 --> 56:51.580
And how are you spelling that?

56:51.684 --> 56:54.169
A-D-A-M. So that's...
that's very similar to Adam.

56:54.272 --> 56:55.550
- Oh, I can't believe it.
- But, okay, your name is Adam.

56:55.653 --> 56:57.483
Come on, Adam.
He's got a voucher.

56:57.586 --> 56:59.001
I don't know why you're
giving him such a hard time.

56:59.105 --> 57:00.934
Can we go back
to quiet time, please?

57:01.038 --> 57:02.591
Yeah.

57:02.695 --> 57:04.938
- I have a voucher.
- He's got a voucher.

57:05.042 --> 57:07.113
And I need to know
if you have a room.

57:07.493 --> 57:08.977
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

57:09.805 --> 57:12.498
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh, what?

57:13.395 --> 57:15.397
- He has a room.
- Uh-oh.

57:18.435 --> 57:21.990
How many be...
How many beds in the room?

57:22.093 --> 57:24.061
- Ask if there's a sauna.
-  What?

57:24.164 --> 57:27.167
- Yeah.
- I'm not gonna...

57:28.445 --> 57:30.136
- Just ask. Come on.

57:30.239 --> 57:31.413
- Adam...
- Is there a sauna?

57:31.517 --> 57:32.656
Stop it!

57:33.484 --> 57:34.623
Adam, do you have a...

57:34.727 --> 57:36.694
No, please.
I can't go back on hold.

57:36.798 --> 57:37.833
- Yes.
- Oh, no! No. No.

57:37.937 --> 57:39.145
It's a very particular
kind of hell.

57:42.528 --> 57:44.875
- Sauna?
- I'm serious.

57:44.978 --> 57:47.153
I, I, I hear you.

57:47.843 --> 57:50.156
- I always get dehydrated.

57:50.259 --> 57:52.261
You were so dehydrated.

57:54.954 --> 57:57.128
- Hey. Adam, I'm still here.

57:57.232 --> 57:59.061
Bill. Bill here. Yeah. Yeah.

57:59.821 --> 58:01.512
What? I... What's that?

58:02.789 --> 58:04.757
You made a mistake?

58:04.860 --> 58:07.311
Oh, no. Does he have
a sauna or not?

58:07.414 --> 58:08.692
They don't have a room.

58:09.244 --> 58:10.590
What fine print?

58:11.384 --> 58:13.110
- Fine print.
- Oh, no.

58:13.213 --> 58:14.387
Where? Is there any...

58:14.491 --> 58:16.872
This whole thing
is fine print all over here.

58:18.874 --> 58:20.773
- That hurts to try to...
- Look.

58:20.876 --> 58:23.569
- No. Yeah.
-"Subject to availabilities."

58:23.672 --> 58:25.950
-"Rooms are not guaranteed."
- Not guaranteed.

58:28.850 --> 58:30.817
There's a catch to everything
these days, huh?

58:30.921 --> 58:31.715
Yeah.

58:31.818 --> 58:33.268
Maybe this is
what getting old is.

58:33.371 --> 58:35.891
You realize that the world
is no longer built for you.

58:35.995 --> 58:37.928
That's kind of
a buzzkill, Bill.

58:38.031 --> 58:40.896
I mean, just when
you reach the age,

58:41.000 --> 58:42.553
when you have
something significant

58:42.657 --> 58:43.761
or insightful to say

58:43.865 --> 58:46.764
about anything, really.

58:46.868 --> 58:49.111
- Nobody wants to hear it?
- No, no.

58:49.215 --> 58:51.424
Who cares what old people
have on their minds?

58:51.528 --> 58:52.770
- No one.
- Oh!

58:52.874 --> 58:54.220
Not even old people.

58:54.323 --> 58:55.566
- Oh!
- You can't hear that?

58:55.670 --> 58:57.016
- That is so depressing!

58:57.119 --> 58:59.432
- Where is that coming from?
- That's how it ends.

58:59.536 --> 59:01.261
We're old and we're mute,

59:01.365 --> 59:04.575
and we're savaged
by the pharmaceutical giants.

59:05.265 --> 59:06.370
I don't accept that.

59:06.473 --> 59:10.719
<i>Boston passenger,
Davis, first initial W.,</i>

59:10.823 --> 59:12.100
<i>please see the gate agent</i>

59:12.203 --> 59:14.274
<i>for immediate boarding
at gate 10.</i>

59:14.378 --> 59:16.656
Willa, is that your flight?
They're calling your flight?

59:16.760 --> 59:17.933
- I don't know.
Yeah, this could be

59:18.037 --> 59:19.935
the window where
they can get some planes out.

59:21.488 --> 59:24.630
Was that...
Did I detect optimism?

59:24.733 --> 59:26.114
I said maybe.

59:26.217 --> 59:28.254
<i>Calling all passengers,</i>

59:28.357 --> 59:32.085
<i>flight 394 to Boston
now boarding at gate 10.</i>

59:32.189 --> 59:33.328
Willa, I think that's...

59:34.536 --> 59:35.813
- What?
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

59:35.917 --> 59:37.435
Contraband, really?

59:37.539 --> 59:39.368
Oh, relax. They haven't
caught me yet.

59:39.472 --> 59:41.508
Yet? It's a felony.

59:41.612 --> 59:43.890
Oh, yeah? In how many states?

59:43.994 --> 59:46.375
That's tricky.
Though it's legal
in most states,

59:46.479 --> 59:48.343
federal restrictions
remain in place.

59:48.446 --> 59:50.034
Then I will take my chances.

59:50.138 --> 59:52.036
And can you please turn
that down?

59:52.140 --> 59:54.176
We can't even
hear ourselves argue.

59:54.280 --> 59:55.902
- I know!

59:57.145 --> 59:58.249
Let me
ask you something.

59:58.353 --> 59:59.699
How do you see it playing out?

59:59.803 --> 01:00:01.839
Does my personality
overdose in prison?

01:00:01.943 --> 01:00:03.254
<i>Time to hustle.</i>

01:00:03.358 --> 01:00:05.671
Come on, Willa. You gotta go.

01:00:05.774 --> 01:00:07.396
- Goddamn.
Come on. Willa.

01:00:08.777 --> 01:00:10.468
- Willa, please...
- What?

01:00:10.572 --> 01:00:12.643
Come on.
I'll get all this stuff.

01:00:12.747 --> 01:00:14.956
You just... You just hustle.
All right? Go.

01:00:15.059 --> 01:00:16.543
- Which way do I go?
- Gate 10.

01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:18.097
- Gate 10. Gate 10.
- Which way?

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.858
- Gate 10.
Okay. Gate 10.

01:00:20.962 --> 01:00:22.826
- Hustle.
I'm hustling.

01:00:25.173 --> 01:00:26.726
<i>Boarding all passengers</i>

01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:28.797
<i>flight 394 to Boston.</i>

01:00:28.901 --> 01:00:30.109
I'm hustling.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.388
- Okay.
Willa?

01:00:34.389 --> 01:00:36.425
- Hey.
- Hi. What are you...

01:00:37.116 --> 01:00:40.153
Willa. Hey. Hey.

01:00:40.257 --> 01:00:42.604
Where you going?
Come on. Follow me.

01:00:42.708 --> 01:00:44.330
- Bill. Okay.
- Come on.

01:00:44.433 --> 01:00:46.850
No, no. Straight. Here we go.
Yeah. Here we go.

01:00:46.953 --> 01:00:47.954
Okay.

01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:53.442
Whoo!

01:00:54.823 --> 01:00:56.998
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:00:59.379 --> 01:01:00.622
Oh, God!

01:01:00.726 --> 01:01:02.348
No. No. No. Go!

01:01:02.451 --> 01:01:03.487
- This way. Right?
- Go. Go.

01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:05.731
- That way.
- Oh, God.

01:01:08.112 --> 01:01:09.148
Run!

01:01:12.565 --> 01:01:13.946
Don't look back.

01:01:15.568 --> 01:01:17.156
No, go! Go!

01:01:27.407 --> 01:01:28.961
Okay. You were right.

01:01:29.064 --> 01:01:31.135
There's a window
before they close
the runways again.

01:01:31.239 --> 01:01:33.966
Oh, good for you, Willa.
I'm happy for you.

01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:35.484
They asked me
if I was traveling alone.

01:01:35.588 --> 01:01:38.246
They said they needed my seat
for family on standby.

01:01:39.592 --> 01:01:41.042
You gave up your seat?

01:01:41.145 --> 01:01:43.354
Then they asked me
if I would be willing
to sit in first class.

01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:44.839
- And I said,

01:01:44.942 --> 01:01:46.357
I would take one for the team.

01:01:46.461 --> 01:01:48.290
They just changed gate agents.

01:01:48.394 --> 01:01:51.708
And you are a W. Davis,
just like me.

01:01:51.811 --> 01:01:53.330
- What are you doing?
- Come on. Just take it.

01:01:53.433 --> 01:01:55.090
They're in a rush to board.
They won't notice.

01:01:55.194 --> 01:01:56.402
What's the worst
that can happen?

01:01:56.505 --> 01:01:58.093
Oh, you really want me
to get into that?
- No.

01:01:58.197 --> 01:02:00.026
It's against
federal regulations, for one.

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:01.579
- I don't know the statute...
- Uh, no. No.

01:02:01.683 --> 01:02:03.098
But I'm sure you can get
arrested for doing
something like that.

01:02:03.202 --> 01:02:04.824
- No. Don't tell me that.
- Why are you doing this?

01:02:04.928 --> 01:02:07.137
You can't miss her recital.
Are you nuts?

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.210
<i>Attention
all Executive Diamond
Elite passengers,</i>

01:02:11.313 --> 01:02:14.661
<i>please report to the gate
for immediate boarding.</i>

01:02:14.765 --> 01:02:16.940
Beth-Anne called
to say that...

01:02:17.941 --> 01:02:19.425
Um...

01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:22.255
Rosie doesn't want
to stay with you right now.

01:02:23.222 --> 01:02:26.052
She wants to stay
at Beth-Anne's house
for a few weeks.

01:02:26.156 --> 01:02:28.503
You weren't gonna tell me
your marriage was over?

01:02:34.647 --> 01:02:36.097
Nothing to tell, really.

01:02:37.892 --> 01:02:39.756
She's tired of me.

01:02:39.859 --> 01:02:42.241
And I don't blame her.
I'm tired of myself, too.

01:02:42.344 --> 01:02:43.690
And you're just
gonna let her go?

01:02:43.794 --> 01:02:45.347
You don't know anything about
the situation, Willa, please.

01:02:45.451 --> 01:02:46.935
You're just gonna let
that happen? Come on.

01:02:47.039 --> 01:02:49.524
Just for once in your life,
just don't think about it.

01:02:49.627 --> 01:02:50.905
- Just get on the plane.
- Will you just listen
to yourself,

01:02:51.008 --> 01:02:52.630
with your slogans
and your magical thinking.

01:02:52.734 --> 01:02:54.287
You don't know anything
about commitment.

01:02:54.391 --> 01:02:56.738
Everybody knows somebody
like you, Willa.

01:02:56.842 --> 01:02:58.153
That person in their lives
who has the answer

01:02:58.257 --> 01:02:59.672
to everybody else's problems.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:02.088
But whose own life
is a total fucking mess.

01:03:08.405 --> 01:03:09.406
You're right.

01:03:11.753 --> 01:03:13.203
My life is a mess.

01:03:14.307 --> 01:03:17.828
There's no reason for me
to take this flight.

01:03:17.932 --> 01:03:20.900
<i>Boarding
all passengers, all zones,</i>

01:03:21.004 --> 01:03:22.971

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.939
They're expecting you.

01:03:25.042 --> 01:03:26.492
And I'll disappoint them.
It's happened before.

01:03:26.595 --> 01:03:28.183
Everybody's used to it.

01:03:28.287 --> 01:03:31.014
There is something about you
being sad, Willa.

01:03:33.464 --> 01:03:34.534
Especially you.

01:03:37.917 --> 01:03:39.470
You were gonna storm off
and I really wish

01:03:39.574 --> 01:03:41.024
you would just do that,

01:03:41.127 --> 01:03:43.405
'cause we both know
how good you are at leaving.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:58.973
"Just try."

01:04:00.043 --> 01:04:02.700
Could that be
for you from Ginny?

01:04:02.804 --> 01:04:04.392
There it is. I mean,

01:04:04.495 --> 01:04:05.876
the universe has spoken.

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.015
It wants you to just try.

01:04:07.119 --> 01:04:09.846
The universe doesn't text.

01:04:09.949 --> 01:04:12.158
Well, maybe it is
all hogwash, W. Davis.

01:04:12.262 --> 01:04:14.885
Hogwash. Who says hogwash?

01:04:15.782 --> 01:04:17.198
Maybe it isn't.

01:04:17.301 --> 01:04:21.650
<i>Final call,

01:04:21.754 --> 01:04:22.997
Safe travels.

01:04:32.938 --> 01:04:34.318
I didn't even get your number.

01:04:40.497 --> 01:04:41.567
Thank you.

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:16.705

<i>All flights are suspended

01:05:37.209 --> 01:05:39.694
<i>However, please do not leave

01:05:39.797 --> 01:05:43.318
<i>since the situation

01:05:44.147 --> 01:05:47.184
No, I don't think it changes.

01:05:48.323 --> 01:05:50.670
I don't think it changes
no matter what we do.

01:05:52.362 --> 01:05:54.364
<i>Dear Boston passenger Davis,</i>

01:05:55.227 --> 01:05:56.745

01:06:05.651 --> 01:06:08.516
Yes, I'm trying,

When you invite me to...

01:06:11.415 --> 01:06:13.590
All due respect, Kevin,
but when you say "We,"

01:06:13.693 --> 01:06:14.763
do you mean you?

01:06:14.867 --> 01:06:16.213
I'm just asking
because old people

01:06:16.317 --> 01:06:18.698
have a hard time
with pronouns these days,
you know? So...

01:06:20.252 --> 01:06:22.081
So "we" is you. Okay.

01:06:22.426 --> 01:06:25.015
Hello? Hello?

01:06:28.398 --> 01:06:29.502

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:16.411
Bring that back.

01:07:56.348 --> 01:07:58.729
Hey. Hey, bring that back.

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:01.353
Bring that back.

01:08:02.526 --> 01:08:03.527
Willa?

01:08:07.911 --> 01:08:09.085
Willa!

01:08:20.337 --> 01:08:22.270
Fuck off, already!

01:08:22.374 --> 01:08:24.893
I wanna talk
to whoever's in charge

01:08:24.997 --> 01:08:28.759
because we are getting
completely screwed
around with down here!

01:08:28.863 --> 01:08:31.486
You are doing a fucked up job!

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:34.489
Why? What's the joke?

01:08:34.593 --> 01:08:36.767
Am I the joke?
What's the point?

01:08:39.011 --> 01:08:40.495
Is anybody listening?

01:08:43.257 --> 01:08:44.361
No one's listening.

Bullshit! Oh, bullshit.

01:08:54.509 --> 01:08:57.202
Then do something
about the goddamn music!

01:09:07.246 --> 01:09:08.454
Hello?

01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:11.871
Hello?

01:09:17.325 --> 01:09:19.569
Oh, God.
Where'd I leave my bag?

01:09:21.191 --> 01:09:22.399
Where'd I leave that?

01:09:25.678 --> 01:09:26.852
Really?

01:09:27.818 --> 01:09:29.751
Really? You really took
away my stuff.

01:09:30.959 --> 01:09:33.893
Really? Will you just stop

01:09:33.997 --> 01:09:37.690
Goddamnit! What is the point?

01:10:10.378 --> 01:10:13.001
How I let you talk me
into shit I will never know.

01:10:14.071 --> 01:10:15.383
How far did you get?

01:10:15.487 --> 01:10:17.834
Flight got canceled
before I got my ass
in the seat.

01:10:19.042 --> 01:10:20.388
Could have been good.

01:10:20.492 --> 01:10:22.218
- If it worked.
- Yeah, it could have been good.

01:10:22.321 --> 01:10:24.220
- If it worked.
- That's what I'm saying.

01:10:24.323 --> 01:10:25.359
That's not what you're saying.

01:10:25.462 --> 01:10:26.843
Oh, okay,
then that's what I mean.

01:10:26.946 --> 01:10:29.052
- Ah!
- Ugh!

01:10:29.155 --> 01:10:31.261
I'll never make
Rosie's recital now.

01:10:32.573 --> 01:10:34.368
Yeah, sorry about that.

01:10:35.886 --> 01:10:37.233
At least you tried.

01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:43.308
I'm gonna go
get some sleep, I guess.

01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:45.793
Okay. Yeah, sure.

01:10:46.621 --> 01:10:50.038
- No rooms, no beds, no...
- Sex.

01:10:52.455 --> 01:10:54.353
I guess we were
given another sign.

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.562
Oh, right.
From the universe, huh?

01:10:56.666 --> 01:10:59.531
Yeah. No shower, no rest.

01:10:59.634 --> 01:11:01.049
Apparently,
the universe would rather

01:11:01.153 --> 01:11:02.637
we were smelly and celibate.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:04.432
Yeah.

01:11:05.675 --> 01:11:08.298
- Okay, I'm gonna go.
- All right.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:12.440
Off you go.

01:11:20.137 --> 01:11:22.554
Well, we've already said
our goodbyes, W. Davis.

01:11:22.657 --> 01:11:26.523
No, we didn't. I'm sorry
for what I said before.

01:11:28.111 --> 01:11:30.631
Like Rosie says,
it was a bad bye.

01:11:35.532 --> 01:11:37.810
- Look at that.

01:11:39.778 --> 01:11:41.918
Look at that.
We're all cleansed up.

01:11:42.021 --> 01:11:43.920
- Ah!

01:11:49.235 --> 01:11:50.651
- Okay.
- All right.

01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:52.584
So...

01:12:22.234 --> 01:12:25.755
<i>Attention, Austin

01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:38.802
- What's that even mean?
- It's not a thing.

01:12:38.906 --> 01:12:41.909
- Is that a thing?
<i>Oh, it's a thing.</i>

01:12:42.012 --> 01:12:44.670

01:12:46.741 --> 01:12:47.708

- It is a thing. It's a thing.

01:12:52.402 --> 01:12:53.679
- Wow.

01:12:55.267 --> 01:12:56.855
That is so messed up.

01:12:56.958 --> 01:12:59.064
That is so messed up,
W. Davis.

01:12:59.167 --> 01:13:00.617
Mm-hmm.
- It is.

01:13:02.136 --> 01:13:04.863
- I can...
- It's...

01:13:04.966 --> 01:13:06.865
- Ah! Yeah.
- Okay.

01:13:07.624 --> 01:13:09.315
- What are you doing?
- I'm surrendering.

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:10.972
I can only think
of one option.

01:13:11.076 --> 01:13:12.215
What?

01:13:12.318 --> 01:13:13.699
- What?
- You want a drink?

01:13:13.803 --> 01:13:17.427
Oh, we absolutely do not need
any more to drink.

01:13:17.531 --> 01:13:19.602
I filched these from behind
the bar back there.

01:13:20.741 --> 01:13:23.399
- Who says filched?
This guy.

01:13:23.502 --> 01:13:26.332
A little vodka
and a little gin.

01:13:26.436 --> 01:13:27.748
Okay.

01:13:28.783 --> 01:13:30.647
I'm gonna filch
some gin from you.

01:13:30.751 --> 01:13:31.959
Okay.

- Here's you.
- Stop that.

01:13:46.663 --> 01:13:49.494
Stop it. Stop. Don't do that.

01:13:49.597 --> 01:13:50.736
It's not funny.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.566

and waste our time</i>

<i>♪ Pure and simple

01:16:27.928 --> 01:16:29.826
If we could see
our memories in advance,

01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:31.897
would we do
anything different?

01:16:32.001 --> 01:16:32.967
Hmm?

01:16:34.797 --> 01:16:36.212
Are you happy, W. Davis?

01:16:37.523 --> 01:16:39.698
Please don't ruin this.

01:16:39.802 --> 01:16:42.736
I mean, isn't that
the one question

01:16:42.839 --> 01:16:44.289
we should really be
asking each other?

01:16:44.392 --> 01:16:46.084
- Are you happy?
- Okay.

01:16:51.296 --> 01:16:52.608
Here's the thing.

01:16:53.298 --> 01:16:55.714
I used to dream
about my motorcycle.

01:16:58.441 --> 01:17:00.892
You never had a motorcycle.
You're just messing with me.

01:17:00.995 --> 01:17:03.757
Don't... Don't get ahead of me.
It's my story.

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:05.759
I used to dream
about my motorcycle.

01:17:05.862 --> 01:17:09.555
Where I'd go,
who I'd be if I had it.

01:17:09.659 --> 01:17:11.316
But it was too risky.
I got scared

01:17:11.419 --> 01:17:12.628
of the paralysis statistics,

01:17:12.731 --> 01:17:14.146
so I could never
pull the trigger.

01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:15.389
No motorcycle.

01:17:16.839 --> 01:17:18.910
You know what I do love?

01:17:19.013 --> 01:17:21.395
- What I really, really love?
- What?

01:17:22.776 --> 01:17:24.053
My leaf blower.

01:17:26.124 --> 01:17:28.264
- Your lawn mower?
- No, my leaf blower.

01:17:28.989 --> 01:17:30.749
Getting those leaves
in one big pile

01:17:30.853 --> 01:17:32.751
and then blowing up that pile
to smithereens

01:17:32.855 --> 01:17:34.373
and making order
out of disorder

01:17:34.477 --> 01:17:35.581
and then disorder
out of order,

01:17:35.685 --> 01:17:37.929
over and over again.
"This is my backyard."

01:17:38.688 --> 01:17:40.069
I love my leaf blower.

01:17:43.003 --> 01:17:44.660
I'm a leaf blower guy,

01:17:46.696 --> 01:17:48.215
not a motorcycle guy.

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:57.673
Well, so it seems
to me you're saying

01:17:57.776 --> 01:18:01.469
everything...
everything works out okay.

01:18:03.195 --> 01:18:06.854
It is what it is
and that's okay.

01:18:09.167 --> 01:18:12.170
Most of the things
I worried about
never happened anyway.

01:18:13.723 --> 01:18:14.966
Wait a minute. Who said that?

01:18:15.069 --> 01:18:16.830
"Most things I worried about
never happened anyway."

01:18:16.933 --> 01:18:18.866
- I did.
- No. No.

01:18:18.970 --> 01:18:20.350
- You didn't say that.
- No. I just said it.

01:18:20.454 --> 01:18:22.801
- No, it's Tom Petty said that.
- Well, Tom Petty said it.

01:18:22.905 --> 01:18:24.872
That's who said it.
Tom Petty said it first.

01:18:24.976 --> 01:18:26.978
And it seems to me
what he's saying is

01:18:27.081 --> 01:18:29.256
- that we can relax.
- Yes, you can relax.

01:18:29.359 --> 01:18:31.707
That's what me
and Tom Petty are saying.

01:18:32.535 --> 01:18:34.399
- Me and Tom.
- Both of you?

01:18:34.502 --> 01:18:36.297
- Yeah.
- Relax.

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.267
Hmm.

01:18:41.164 --> 01:18:42.752
So you're not disappointed?

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:52.486
Not really. No.

01:18:53.349 --> 01:18:55.006
- You?

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:03.393
- Teeny tiny bit.
- Yeah.

01:19:13.334 --> 01:19:15.060
Guess we're
the only ones left.

01:19:15.164 --> 01:19:16.268
Yeah.

01:19:24.725 --> 01:19:26.727
- There's something I...
- There's something I should...

01:19:26.831 --> 01:19:30.386
You go. You go. You say it.

01:19:30.489 --> 01:19:33.078
There's something
I should have asked you
before I left Madison.

01:19:34.666 --> 01:19:35.978
Okay. Ask me anything.

01:19:39.947 --> 01:19:41.121
How many were there?

01:19:42.605 --> 01:19:43.744
How many guys?

01:19:45.988 --> 01:19:48.369
Oh.

01:19:49.715 --> 01:19:50.716
You are not going to like it.

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:51.821
I'm not... I'm not gonna care.

01:19:51.925 --> 01:19:53.236
It was a long time ago.
It's okay.

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.067
No. If you want, uh,
names or...

01:19:56.170 --> 01:19:57.758
I don't want names.
I don't need...

01:19:57.862 --> 01:19:58.828
I think I know the names.

01:19:58.932 --> 01:20:00.381
No, you absolutely
don't know the names

01:20:00.485 --> 01:20:02.142
because there weren't any.

01:20:03.143 --> 01:20:04.869
- None at all.
- Willa, come on.

01:20:04.972 --> 01:20:06.629
- I'm telling you the truth.
- I was there.

01:20:06.732 --> 01:20:08.010
I watched it happen.
I know what I saw.

01:20:08.113 --> 01:20:09.287
I know what you saw.

01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:10.598
Just admit it.

01:20:10.702 --> 01:20:12.290
- Admit there were
a lot of other guys.
- No, I won't admit it.

01:20:12.393 --> 01:20:14.292
What? No. Hold on.
Just let me get this straight.

01:20:17.122 --> 01:20:19.780
- You were faithful?
- Yes.

01:20:19.884 --> 01:20:22.093
- That is so fucked up!
- I'm sorry.

01:20:22.196 --> 01:20:24.750
- I'm so sorry.

01:20:24.854 --> 01:20:25.786
- I cannot believe it.
- I know.

01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:27.132
You weren't sleeping around?

01:20:27.236 --> 01:20:28.651
No, no.

01:20:28.754 --> 01:20:29.859
- You were faithful?
- I'm sorry.

01:20:29.963 --> 01:20:32.068
- You were faithful?
- I'm saying I'm sorry.

01:20:32.172 --> 01:20:33.656
- I'm saying I'm sorry.
- Do you know
how fucked up that is?

01:20:33.759 --> 01:20:35.658
Yeah, I get it if I look at it
from your point of view.

01:20:35.761 --> 01:20:37.142
I get that
it's totally messed up.

01:20:37.246 --> 01:20:39.420
- It makes no sense at all.
- Oh. Thank you.

01:21:00.096 --> 01:21:01.891
I'd like it
if you said something.

01:21:14.524 --> 01:21:15.871
I left...

01:21:21.083 --> 01:21:22.636
I left Madison
because I thought

01:21:22.739 --> 01:21:23.982
you'd been with all...

01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:36.615
I'll never forget
her little smile.

01:21:38.617 --> 01:21:41.172
I loved her.

01:21:41.275 --> 01:21:42.276
And I...

01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:45.935
wasn't even sure she was mine.

01:21:47.592 --> 01:21:49.559
And you're right. I, uh...

01:21:50.975 --> 01:21:52.390
I was relieved.

01:21:53.391 --> 01:21:55.496
But not because I didn't think
you'd make a great mother.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:56.670
I knew you would.

01:22:03.504 --> 01:22:05.023
I was just afraid that

01:22:06.059 --> 01:22:07.025
you wouldn't commit

01:22:07.129 --> 01:22:08.509
to a traditional life
like that.

01:22:08.613 --> 01:22:09.717
To a...

01:22:12.237 --> 01:22:13.721
To a traditional family.

01:22:15.758 --> 01:22:17.242
I was ballast.

01:22:18.416 --> 01:22:20.728
Remember?
We always used to say that.

01:22:21.315 --> 01:22:24.318
- Yeah. Yeah, we did.
- Yeah.

01:22:24.422 --> 01:22:25.975
The ballast gets
thrown overboard

01:22:26.079 --> 01:22:27.321
when you wanna go higher.

01:22:28.771 --> 01:22:32.257
I was afraid that
you'd resent me

01:22:33.258 --> 01:22:34.570
for feeling tied down.

01:22:43.234 --> 01:22:44.442
You were right.

01:22:47.686 --> 01:22:48.998
You were right.

01:22:51.656 --> 01:22:52.622
Yeah.

01:22:55.694 --> 01:22:56.972
I'm sorry, W. Davis.

01:22:58.594 --> 01:23:00.251
I'm sorry, W. Davis.

01:23:03.806 --> 01:23:04.772
I'm sorry.

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:37.150
Wow.

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:02.175
You know, she'd be
26 years old right now?

01:24:02.278 --> 01:24:04.073
Twenty-five.

01:24:04.177 --> 01:24:06.765
Know what else?
She'd have your smile.

01:24:09.803 --> 01:24:11.253
And my smile.

01:24:17.190 --> 01:24:20.331
Um, can I just say?
- Anything.

01:24:20.434 --> 01:24:22.436
You always kind of baffled me.
You know that?

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:23.748
- Well, I like that.
- What?

01:24:23.851 --> 01:24:25.612
- I like baffling you.
- You do?

01:24:25.715 --> 01:24:27.269
- It makes me mysterious.

01:24:27.372 --> 01:24:29.271
The baffler.

01:24:31.273 --> 01:24:32.446
I thought you had
all the answers.

01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:34.483
I do, but I don't
know anything.

01:24:34.586 --> 01:24:36.864
Oh, neither do I.
- Nobody does.

01:24:36.968 --> 01:24:39.453
No, we are ridiculous!

01:24:39.557 --> 01:24:42.215
You know, I thought
I'd leave you behind
in Madison,

01:24:42.318 --> 01:24:44.217
and the next great thing
would happen to me.

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:47.047
And I would meet these people

01:24:47.151 --> 01:24:50.188
that would make me
feel like you did.

01:24:50.292 --> 01:24:53.295
But I never did again.

01:24:55.952 --> 01:24:59.439
I never again met anybody
that made me feel
the way you do.

01:25:04.754 --> 01:25:07.274
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

01:25:10.450 --> 01:25:11.865
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah.

01:25:11.968 --> 01:25:14.005
Is that her? Is that Rosie?

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:16.249
I don't know.
- Where's your phone?

01:25:16.352 --> 01:25:19.321
You hear that?
I got it. It's her.

01:25:19.424 --> 01:25:20.667
Give me a sec.
- Yeah.

01:25:21.254 --> 01:25:23.359
Rosie? Hi.

01:25:23.877 --> 01:25:24.981
Yeah.

01:25:25.534 --> 01:25:27.846
I, uh, I've thinking about,

01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:29.952
you know,
the dancing and, um...

01:25:30.884 --> 01:25:35.544
You know, if you talk
about something,
it's a dream.

01:25:35.647 --> 01:25:37.787
If you envision it,
it's a possibility.

01:25:37.891 --> 01:25:39.582
And... And if you...

01:25:39.686 --> 01:25:42.758
if you schedule it,
it's a reality.

01:25:44.898 --> 01:25:45.864
Tony Robbins.

01:25:49.799 --> 01:25:50.869
Um...

01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:56.427
Look, honey, uh, just dance.

01:25:58.222 --> 01:26:01.501
Just have fun, you know?
Don't...

01:26:02.571 --> 01:26:06.230
Don't worry about anything.
All right?

01:26:07.886 --> 01:26:08.922
Just dance.

01:26:10.993 --> 01:26:11.959
I love you.

01:26:13.478 --> 01:26:16.101
Oh, and, um, you know,

01:26:16.205 --> 01:26:18.345
the world will
break your heart.

01:26:19.864 --> 01:26:23.523
And, and... Because
the world breaks
everybody's heart,

01:26:23.626 --> 01:26:27.112
and no father has ever
been able to stop that.

01:26:27.216 --> 01:26:28.666
But a good father,

01:26:29.287 --> 01:26:30.668
he learns
how to live with that.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:33.153
Bye.

01:26:33.257 --> 01:26:35.431
What the fuck was that?

01:26:35.535 --> 01:26:37.261
She hung up
like 30 seconds ago.

01:26:37.364 --> 01:26:38.883
- That was for you.
- No!

01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:45.717
No!
- Yeah.

01:27:07.808 --> 01:27:10.811
So, um, hey, W. Davis.
Yeah.

01:27:10.915 --> 01:27:13.642
There's something
I should have told you before.

01:27:13.745 --> 01:27:16.058
You're fucking kidding me.
Before when?

01:27:16.161 --> 01:27:17.542
Just earlier before.

01:27:17.646 --> 01:27:19.234
Really? Another...
another card on the table?

01:27:19.337 --> 01:27:21.305
- Yes. Just one more.
- All right.

01:27:21.408 --> 01:27:22.720
I'm gonna
hold you to it, though.

01:27:23.962 --> 01:27:24.929
Okay.

01:27:25.619 --> 01:27:26.620
Um...

01:27:32.005 --> 01:27:33.386
My daughter's name is Maggie.

01:27:34.421 --> 01:27:36.216
She just turned 20.

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.770
She called to say that
we should meet,

01:27:38.874 --> 01:27:41.048
and so I booked
a flight to Boston.

01:27:46.330 --> 01:27:47.607
Man, oh, man, right?

01:27:48.746 --> 01:27:50.713
You're going to Boston
to meet your daughter.

01:27:52.646 --> 01:27:53.992
Yeah.

01:27:54.096 --> 01:27:56.616
This is not a trip you're on.
This is a journey.

01:27:56.719 --> 01:27:58.411
Yeah, yeah.

01:28:00.723 --> 01:28:01.931
And I'm, uh...

01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:06.281
I'm still really scared.

01:28:07.627 --> 01:28:09.905
And so I texted her that
I'm not coming.

01:28:10.008 --> 01:28:11.734
Oh.

01:28:11.838 --> 01:28:14.530
- She texted you back.
-"Just try."

01:28:15.635 --> 01:28:17.464
That was your daughter
that texted you?

01:28:18.016 --> 01:28:19.294
Yeah.

01:28:20.571 --> 01:28:23.021
- Her number's in your shoe.
- That's right.

01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:26.715
There's no cleansing ceremony
for Ginny.

01:28:26.818 --> 01:28:27.785
No.

01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:30.305
It was supposed to be for me.

01:28:37.277 --> 01:28:38.485
Is that it?

01:28:42.938 --> 01:28:45.285
I'm stuck. I can't stick.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:40.927
There you are.

01:29:41.928 --> 01:29:43.136
All cleansed up.

01:29:45.621 --> 01:29:46.933
You can do this.

01:29:52.835 --> 01:29:54.872
I feel it in my chakras.

01:30:02.293 --> 01:30:04.019
I feel it in my bones.

01:30:18.689 --> 01:30:20.415
- Come on.

01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:23.418

Morning.

01:32:13.286 --> 01:32:14.839
They just called my flight.

01:32:16.703 --> 01:32:17.980
How'd you sleep?

01:32:18.567 --> 01:32:20.293
Um...

01:32:20.396 --> 01:32:21.984
- Poor to piss poor.

01:32:22.088 --> 01:32:24.573
Like right in that area.
How about you?

01:32:24.677 --> 01:32:27.196
Uh, I don't know what
to call my experience.

01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:28.128
- Oh, sleep?
- Yeah...

01:32:28.232 --> 01:32:29.405
- Not the word for it?
- it wasn't sleep.

01:32:29.509 --> 01:32:30.683
- Schlep.
- Schlep.

01:32:32.823 --> 01:32:34.756
Is this small talk?
Are we doing the small talk?

01:32:34.859 --> 01:32:36.896
Yeah. This is actual...
It's coming in handy.

01:32:36.999 --> 01:32:40.209
Oh. Oh, I charged your phone.
There you go.

01:32:42.004 --> 01:32:43.040
Thank you.

01:32:51.255 --> 01:32:53.222
Hey, the music scene
in Austin is really,

01:32:53.326 --> 01:32:55.397
- really good, right?
- Yeah.

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.468
Because I'm thinking
about maybe taking

01:32:57.572 --> 01:32:59.263
a client out one night,

01:33:00.575 --> 01:33:02.507
and maybe
I'll even try to figure out

01:33:02.611 --> 01:33:04.095
what baby Kevin
is trying to say.

01:33:04.199 --> 01:33:05.200
- Okay.
- He's...

01:33:05.303 --> 01:33:07.789

something, right?
Mm-hmm.

Hey. Oh, I know that look.

01:33:24.012 --> 01:33:27.291
No, I know
what you're thinking
and don't you dare.

01:33:27.394 --> 01:33:29.742
- Don't you dare
not get on that plane.

01:33:29.845 --> 01:33:32.227
You don't have to stick.
You just have to get there.

01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:33.538
I can't.

01:33:33.642 --> 01:33:35.713
Yes, I know it feels that way,
but you can.

01:33:35.817 --> 01:33:37.232

- No, you're not quitting.
-  They just...

01:33:43.583 --> 01:33:45.689
You're so close.
You're not going to quit.

01:33:46.551 --> 01:33:47.656
- And by the way,

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.589

01:34:10.127 --> 01:34:11.162
Thank you.

01:34:12.681 --> 01:34:13.889
I'm going to give you my card,

01:34:15.477 --> 01:34:16.961
but it's an old card, so...

01:34:17.065 --> 01:34:19.032
I'm going to write
my number on the back.

01:34:20.033 --> 01:34:22.518
And then you're gonna
write that number

01:34:22.622 --> 01:34:24.244
on the inside of your shoe.

01:34:25.556 --> 01:34:26.488
Okay.

01:34:26.591 --> 01:34:29.284
And, uh, one last thing.

01:34:30.837 --> 01:34:32.321

No.

- Yeah.

Oh, we got lucky.
