18:29.241 --> 18:31.577
- Found 'em!

18:31.643 --> 18:33.812
Hmm. Whoops.

18:33.879 --> 18:36.215
Not my teeth.

18:39.218 --> 18:40.986
- [sighs]

18:41.053 --> 18:43.021
{\an1}- I'm really nervous
about my reading tomorrow.

18:43.088 --> 18:44.723
Do vocal exercises help?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.525
I know one called
the endless moan.

18:46.592 --> 18:50.162
[moaning]

18:50.229 --> 18:53.565
{\an3}- Sure, do that.
That's great.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.267
- Which shade of black
do you think is better

18:55.334 --> 18:58.370
{\an3}for the reading,
Eternal Sadness or Vacant Tomb?

18:58.437 --> 19:01.740
- I don't know.
Eternal Tomb.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.775
{\an1}- I read that making good
eye contact with the audience

19:03.842 --> 19:04.843
is important.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.079
{\an3}How's this?

19:07.145 --> 19:09.882
Is this better?

19:09.948 --> 19:12.184
How about this?

19:13.685 --> 19:15.087
What if I get stage fright?

19:15.153 --> 19:17.022
I mean, I could handle
the Giggling Geezer,

19:17.089 --> 19:19.424
but this crowd
is going to be huge.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.094
{\an8}- Why are you even
asking me, Lucy?

19:22.160 --> 19:23.562
{\an3}You're the genius
who got a gig

19:23.629 --> 19:25.898
{\an3}at the Royal Woods Theater,
not me.

19:25.964 --> 19:29.201
{\an3}So why don't you
figure it out?

19:29.268 --> 19:31.270
- You done with the TV?
[door slams]

19:31.336 --> 19:34.006
Whoa.
- What was that about?

19:34.072 --> 19:35.407
- I think I know.

19:35.474 --> 19:38.377
There's something
that I need to tell you.

19:41.413 --> 19:44.349
- Okay, let's just
get this over with.

19:44.416 --> 19:47.486
Oh, maybe they'll seat us
behind someone with big hair,

19:47.553 --> 19:51.023
so I don't have to watch
my sister steal my dreams.

19:51.089 --> 19:52.424
[toilet flushes]

19:52.491 --> 19:55.360
- But, Lori, I was wearing
fuchsia today!

19:55.427 --> 19:57.329
- 83...84...
- Hey, what's going on?

19:57.396 --> 19:59.231
{\an1}Why isn't anybody ready
for Lucy's reading?

19:59.298 --> 20:01.633
- Lucy will not be doing
said reading.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.302
{\an8}- What? Why not?

20:03.368 --> 20:05.470
{\an9}- She claims to be ill, though
I just checked her vitals,

20:05.537 --> 20:07.706
{\an8}and she seems to be
medically fine.

20:07.773 --> 20:11.043
{\an8}It must all be in her head.

20:11.109 --> 20:12.611
[bell dings]

20:12.678 --> 20:15.747
{\an1}- Hey, Luce, Lisa said you're
too sick to do the reading.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.082
- Cough. Cough.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.184
Yeah, my throat
is killing me,

20:19.251 --> 20:21.520
{\an3}and I think
I've got a fever.

20:21.587 --> 20:23.956
- Pfft, that was weak.

20:24.022 --> 20:26.224
- Hmm, you feel fine to me.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.126
{\an1}Is there any chance
you're faking

20:28.193 --> 20:30.762
{\an1}just because you're
afraid to go onstage?

20:30.829 --> 20:33.165
- Um, not exactly.

20:33.231 --> 20:35.434
{\an1}- Hmm, well, something's
going on.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.768
You can tell me.

20:36.835 --> 20:38.437
- Sigh. Okay.

20:38.503 --> 20:40.172
Lincoln told me
it was your dream

20:40.238 --> 20:41.940
to be the youngest person
to ever perform

20:42.007 --> 20:43.642
at the Royal Woods Theater.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.410
I don't wanna
take that from you.

20:45.477 --> 20:47.346
- Really?
So you're giving up

20:47.412 --> 20:49.748
on this huge opportunity
just for me?

20:49.815 --> 20:54.353
{\an3}- How could I not
after all you've done for me?

20:54.419 --> 20:56.121
{\an1}- All right,
get out of bed.

20:56.188 --> 20:59.157
- What?
- You're doing the festival.

21:02.494 --> 21:04.196
{\an1}I think we should go
with Vacant Tomb.

21:04.262 --> 21:06.331
- That's actually
Eternal Sadness.

21:06.398 --> 21:09.267
{\an3}Lynn, I don't understand.
What about--

21:09.334 --> 21:11.036
{\an1}- What kind of a mentor
would I be

21:11.103 --> 21:13.305
{\an1}if I allowed you to miss
this opportunity?

21:13.372 --> 21:16.608
{\an1}Look, I'm sorry
I got jealous before.

21:16.675 --> 21:19.645
You've earned this.

21:19.711 --> 21:22.147
- Thanks, Luan.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.516
{\an1}- Honey,
Lucy's hugging someone!

21:24.583 --> 21:26.084
Get the camera!

21:26.151 --> 21:28.153
<i>[orchestral music]</i>

21:28.220 --> 21:30.022
- Ladies and gentlemen,

21:30.088 --> 21:33.925
please welcome our next poet,
Lucy Loud.

21:33.992 --> 21:36.228
[applause]

21:43.602 --> 21:46.571
- This poem goes out
to the person who got me here,

21:46.638 --> 21:49.841
my big sister Luan.

21:49.908 --> 21:51.777
Dreams burnt to ash.

21:51.843 --> 21:53.478
Hope tangled like laces.

21:53.545 --> 21:57.582
Till love swept in with
puns and funny faces.

21:57.649 --> 22:01.153
Where my path will lead
I can't be sure.

22:01.219 --> 22:04.623
But if ever I'm lost,
I'll look up to her.
