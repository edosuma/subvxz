00:02.407 --> 00:03.874
(theme music)

00:45.251 --> 00:46.984
(muffled chatter)

00:48.487 --> 00:50.420
(indistinct chatter)
(slurping)

00:50.422 --> 00:53.523
- Don't try slinking out of here
without settling your tab.

00:53.526 --> 00:54.792
(scoffs)

00:55.460 --> 00:56.827
- I'd never!

00:56.928 --> 00:58.095
Oh!

00:58.097 --> 01:01.165
Come on, diana,
let a man imbibe in peace.

01:02.734 --> 01:03.967
(chuckling)

01:03.969 --> 01:05.169
Thank you.

01:11.177 --> 01:13.843
- Ah! Well, hello!

01:13.846 --> 01:15.845
Welcome to shuckers.
They call me mother.

01:15.848 --> 01:17.180
What can I do for you?

01:17.183 --> 01:18.781
- Table for six, please.

01:18.784 --> 01:19.783
(whistling)

01:19.785 --> 01:20.984
- Table for six!

01:21.086 --> 01:22.585
What's the occasion?

01:22.588 --> 01:24.454
- We're celebrating
this young man's

01:24.456 --> 01:25.856
Last few days of bachelorhood.

01:25.958 --> 01:27.391
- Ho, ho! Ladies!

01:27.493 --> 01:29.993
I want you to take good care
of these handsome fellows.

01:30.095 --> 01:31.795
A couple pitchers to start off?

01:31.897 --> 01:34.031
- Sounds lovely.
- All right.

01:35.801 --> 01:37.234
- Thank you.

01:38.537 --> 01:39.903
(sighing)

01:42.774 --> 01:45.275
Why the sour face, higgins?
Sit down.

01:45.845 --> 01:48.077
- I still think we should have
gone to the burlesque.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.214
- This place
is more respectable.

01:50.216 --> 01:52.416
We can drink beer,
eat some oysters

01:52.418 --> 01:53.951
And none of us
will get in trouble

01:54.052 --> 01:55.486
With our indoors.

01:58.223 --> 01:59.389
- How you fellas doing?

01:59.491 --> 02:00.824
- Well, we could use a refill.

02:00.926 --> 02:02.226
- All right. Right up!

02:02.895 --> 02:03.894
(clears throat)

02:03.896 --> 02:06.763
- Uh, a garden, couple goats
and a chicken.

02:06.765 --> 02:08.298
What would you prefer:
Goats or chickens?

02:08.400 --> 02:10.634
- All right,
who's up for an arm wrestle?

02:10.736 --> 02:13.570
Two dollars says I can beat
any man here.

02:13.572 --> 02:15.438
- Well, I'll take that bet.

02:15.441 --> 02:16.874
(chuckling)
(cheering)

02:16.975 --> 02:18.342
(laughing)

02:23.916 --> 02:25.015
(sighing)

02:27.386 --> 02:29.052
(groans)
- go on, higgins!

02:30.422 --> 02:32.355
(grunts)
(laughing)

02:32.358 --> 02:33.657
- Who's next?

02:33.758 --> 02:35.292
- What are you laughing at?

02:35.961 --> 02:37.327
- Not much.

02:37.329 --> 02:39.062
- Oi, I know you.

02:39.164 --> 02:41.665
- You should.
You arrested me.

02:41.667 --> 02:43.533
- Then why aren't you
behind bars?

02:43.536 --> 02:45.068
- It didn't stick.

02:45.070 --> 02:47.504
(laughing)

02:50.676 --> 02:53.677
- Oh, maddie, why don't you
play something

02:53.679 --> 02:55.245
A little bit more upbeat?

02:56.248 --> 02:58.215
(soft piano playing)

02:58.316 --> 03:00.684
(grunts)

03:00.686 --> 03:02.752
I love when you play for me.

03:02.755 --> 03:03.987
- Oh, you're good.

03:04.957 --> 03:06.790
(grunts)
- hey!

03:07.560 --> 03:09.426
You gib-faced oaf!

03:09.428 --> 03:12.196
You need to pay for my drink!
(grunts)

03:12.764 --> 03:14.464
(grunts)

03:14.566 --> 03:16.767
- Tucker, that's enough!
Sit down.

03:20.205 --> 03:21.271
(clears throat)

03:21.774 --> 03:23.473
Pay the man for his beer.

03:28.781 --> 03:30.580
- Oh, shucker girl!

03:30.582 --> 03:32.449
Another round
for the oyster king!

03:32.550 --> 03:34.017
(laughing)

03:35.020 --> 03:36.853
(clears troat)
- more respectable,

03:36.855 --> 03:37.854
You were saying, sir?

03:37.956 --> 03:39.790
- Shut your trap, higgins.

03:39.891 --> 03:41.491
(bell ringing)
- all right, boys!

03:41.493 --> 03:43.060
It's gobblin' time!

03:43.161 --> 03:45.595
Who will take the crown?

03:45.697 --> 03:46.863
Ha-ha!

03:46.865 --> 03:48.765
(indistinct chatter)

03:57.743 --> 04:01.411
Three, two, one... And time.

04:01.513 --> 04:03.346
Gentlemen, drop your oysters.

04:03.449 --> 04:07.618
Take a break, grab a beer,
while we set up for round two.

04:09.488 --> 04:11.154
More over here!

04:13.092 --> 04:14.458
More here!

04:16.995 --> 04:18.562
(thudding)

04:18.664 --> 04:21.064
(screaming)

04:21.800 --> 04:22.833
- Crikey.

04:24.036 --> 04:25.702
- Should have gone
to the burlesque.

04:35.213 --> 04:37.648
- Poor chap was alive and well
an hour ago.

04:37.749 --> 04:39.449
- Where's mrs. Hart?

04:39.551 --> 04:42.052
- There was no answer
at her home.

04:42.054 --> 04:44.354
We'll get her
postmortem tomorrow.

04:44.356 --> 04:46.522
- Well, it looks pretty cut
and dried to me.

04:46.525 --> 04:48.859
Someone slashed his throat
and chucked him in a barrel.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.127
- Hmm.

04:50.129 --> 04:53.230
And then hammered the lid
back on in haste.

04:54.533 --> 04:57.334
Was there anyone suspicious
here this evening?

04:57.435 --> 04:58.402
- Well, yes, sir.

04:58.503 --> 05:01.772
There was man with a...
An elaborate moustache.

05:03.308 --> 05:04.941
- What made him suspicious?

05:06.378 --> 05:07.477
- He mocked me, sir.

05:07.479 --> 05:09.813
And then disappeared
for the rest of the evening.

05:09.914 --> 05:12.182
- Mocking you is hardly
a crime, higgins.

05:12.283 --> 05:14.284
More like an amusing pastime.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.087
Look, if we're talking suspects,
I hate to say it,

05:17.189 --> 05:19.756
But the dead fella bloodied
constable tucker's nose

05:19.758 --> 05:21.758
Earlier in the evening.
- That's right.

05:21.860 --> 05:23.493
And then tucker was missing
from the bar

05:23.595 --> 05:25.128
For a time afterwards.

05:26.031 --> 05:28.098
- Constable tucker!
- Yes, sir.

05:28.199 --> 05:29.666
- A word, please.

05:34.573 --> 05:35.772
Oh.

05:35.774 --> 05:37.974
You look ill.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.910
- Yes, I'm sorry.

05:40.011 --> 05:41.644
I had too much to drink.

05:41.647 --> 05:43.113
- I can see that.

05:43.982 --> 05:47.450
Is it true that you fought
with the victim earlier tonight?

05:47.552 --> 05:51.588
- Again, I... I've behaved
very badly this evening.

05:51.590 --> 05:52.923
- Hmm.

05:52.925 --> 05:56.193
And did this bad behaviour
include murder?

05:56.562 --> 05:58.461
- Oh, of course not!
I'm an officer of the law.

05:58.464 --> 06:00.197
I'd-I'd-I'd never do that.

06:00.298 --> 06:01.865
- You disappeared for part
of the evening.

06:01.967 --> 06:03.133
Where did you go?

06:03.802 --> 06:05.001
- Oh.

06:06.237 --> 06:07.471
That. I, uh...

06:08.774 --> 06:11.608
I blacked out
in the water closet.

06:11.610 --> 06:14.010
I... The drinks and the-the...

06:14.846 --> 06:16.313
...Oysters.

06:18.083 --> 06:19.348
Would you excuse me!

06:19.351 --> 06:20.484
(gasping)

06:21.887 --> 06:23.820
- Henry, see to it
that constable tucker

06:23.922 --> 06:25.755
Does not leave the premises.

06:26.358 --> 06:28.558
- You want me to guard
the washroom, sir?

06:28.660 --> 06:29.759
- Yes.

06:29.861 --> 06:31.093
- Fine.

06:31.630 --> 06:34.164
(clicks tongue)
- poor mick.

06:34.265 --> 06:36.233
He was one of our
best customers.

06:36.334 --> 06:38.301
I can't believe somebody
did him dirty.

06:39.037 --> 06:42.305
- Miss malone, is it?
- Detective. Yes.

06:42.307 --> 06:44.908
- Were you well acquainted
with the victim?

06:44.910 --> 06:47.577
- As acquainted as you get
serving a man booze.

06:47.579 --> 06:49.446
I mean, mick peterson
was a bachelor.

06:49.448 --> 06:50.447
He lived alone.

06:50.549 --> 06:52.516
He had big dreams,
but not the means

06:52.617 --> 06:53.884
To make 'em come true.

06:54.319 --> 06:55.252
- Hmm.

06:55.788 --> 06:57.921
And were you present
the entire evening?

06:58.022 --> 06:59.222
- Hovering like a hawk.

06:59.324 --> 07:02.459
It takes a firm hand
to guide this motley crew.

07:02.894 --> 07:05.862
- What about the hour leading up
to the discovery of his body?

07:05.964 --> 07:08.331
- Oh! The music
was hopping by then.

07:08.433 --> 07:09.398
(laughing)

07:09.401 --> 07:11.334
I was having a laugh
on the dance floor.

07:11.336 --> 07:13.203
- Uh. And your staff?

07:13.205 --> 07:15.205
- Oh, ask 'em yourself.

07:15.207 --> 07:17.941
- There is one known criminal
in the bar.

07:17.943 --> 07:19.876
Oi, madeline tomkins!

07:19.978 --> 07:22.546
- Uh, no. Maddie's gone home
for the night.

07:22.647 --> 07:24.381
- Then we'll need her address.

07:26.417 --> 07:27.451
(sighing)

07:28.319 --> 07:29.352
- This is it.

07:29.454 --> 07:31.455
The girls took
the barrel from here.

07:32.591 --> 07:33.690
- Thank you.

07:34.926 --> 07:35.892
- No blood.

07:35.994 --> 07:37.393
No signs of a struggle.

07:38.363 --> 07:40.897
- It's possible the murder
occurred somewhere else.

07:41.733 --> 07:43.233
- And the murderer rolled
the barrel

07:43.334 --> 07:44.500
Back into cold storage

07:44.503 --> 07:46.636
With the body inside.
- Precisely.

07:47.272 --> 07:50.640
But everyone present tonight
claims to have an alibi.

07:51.276 --> 07:54.010
- Keeping the timeline straight
is a challenge.

07:54.947 --> 07:57.981
The whole night is a bit
of a blur, if I'm honest.

07:57.983 --> 07:59.115
- Hmm.

07:59.117 --> 08:00.717
- Where is hart?

08:00.719 --> 08:02.185
- We haven't been able
to reach her.

08:02.287 --> 08:05.622
Sir, might I suggest you go home
and get some rest.

08:05.723 --> 08:08.058
I can finish up here
and we will get

08:08.060 --> 08:09.793
Miss hart's postmortem tomorrow.

08:09.895 --> 08:11.127
- Thank you, mucker.

08:15.433 --> 08:17.067
(indistinct chatter)

08:19.170 --> 08:21.404
- I apologize for my absence
last night.

08:22.106 --> 08:23.673
- Social engagement?

08:23.775 --> 08:26.076
- As they say,
all work and no play.

08:26.078 --> 08:27.076
- Hmm.

08:27.645 --> 08:29.312
- This appears to be
the fatal wound.

08:29.314 --> 08:30.813
His carotid artery was nicked.

08:30.816 --> 08:32.682
He would have bled out
quite quickly.

08:32.784 --> 08:34.718
Was there a lot of blood
at the scene?

08:34.819 --> 08:36.052
- Not a bloody drop.

08:36.154 --> 08:38.554
- At least none visible
to the naked eye.

08:38.557 --> 08:41.557
I'll return to shuckers and
conduct a more thorough search.

08:41.560 --> 08:43.092
- How about the murder weapon?

08:43.095 --> 08:45.294
- Um, some sort of short,
pointed instrument.

08:45.297 --> 08:47.163
- Like an oyster shucker.

08:48.433 --> 08:50.300
- You suspect one of
the shucker girls.

08:50.402 --> 08:51.834
- You bet I do.

08:51.837 --> 08:53.670
And I know exactly which one.

08:54.405 --> 08:55.838
(indistinct chatter)

08:56.808 --> 08:59.475
- Ah, I see you've put
my generous charitable donations

08:59.577 --> 09:01.644
To good use.
- Yes, thank you.

09:01.647 --> 09:03.980
We are so grateful
to all of our donors.

09:03.982 --> 09:06.116
How can I help you today,
mrs. Pinch?

09:06.217 --> 09:08.018
- Doctor ogden,
I am at my wits' end.

09:08.119 --> 09:09.919
Wits' end, I tell you!

09:10.355 --> 09:13.255
My medicine has vanished
from the chemists' shelves.

09:13.258 --> 09:15.324
- Oh! Which medicine?
- Halls coca wine,

09:15.327 --> 09:17.394
The keystone of perfect health.

09:17.495 --> 09:19.528
- Ah, yes, I've seen
the advertisements.

09:19.531 --> 09:21.864
- Then you know of
its restorative powers,

09:21.866 --> 09:25.735
And it cures neuralgia,
sleeplessness, anemia,

09:25.737 --> 09:28.004
And it leaves absolutely
no after-effects.

09:28.006 --> 09:29.673
- Well, actually, mrs. Pinch,

09:29.675 --> 09:31.807
Halls coca wine
contains cocaine,

09:31.810 --> 09:34.344
Which is rather
addictive and harmful.

09:34.346 --> 09:37.279
- It is a miracle tonic
that keeps my spirits high

09:37.282 --> 09:40.283
While I attend to my many
charitable commitments.

09:40.385 --> 09:44.253
Oh, plus, it's done wonders
for my little jenny's shyness.

09:44.256 --> 09:46.822
- Oh, I don't recommend you give
cocaine to your child.

09:46.825 --> 09:49.759
- Oh, but she was such a mopey
little thing without it!

09:49.761 --> 09:53.362
Coca wine has transformed her
into the liveliest

09:53.365 --> 09:54.898
Little six-year-old
you've ever seen.

09:55.900 --> 09:58.034
- Yes, well,
it's no longer on the shelves

09:58.036 --> 10:00.302
Because the new opium
and drug act prohibits

10:00.305 --> 10:01.971
Cocaine for non-medical use.

10:01.974 --> 10:04.306
- Which is why I've come
to see you.

10:04.309 --> 10:06.042
You can provide me
with a prescription.

10:06.044 --> 10:08.444
- I cannot.
Not in good conscience.

10:08.546 --> 10:11.648
There are far healthier ways
to increase your vitality.

10:11.750 --> 10:13.717
- Oh, my goodness.

10:13.818 --> 10:15.451
This looks very expensive.

10:15.454 --> 10:16.987
- Uh, well, yes.

10:17.088 --> 10:18.454
It's a blood pressure monitor

10:18.457 --> 10:20.523
And it's rather expensive.
- Oh.

10:21.059 --> 10:24.127
- Mrs. Pinch, I really don't
think cocaine is the answer--

10:24.228 --> 10:25.662
- I need my coca wine!
- Mrs. Pinch!

10:25.763 --> 10:27.096
- I need it.

10:27.099 --> 10:31.668
- Mrs. Pinch,
you need healthy food

10:31.670 --> 10:35.271
And exercise,
but you do not need cocaine.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.474
- If you're not going
to help me,

10:37.575 --> 10:39.542
Then why did I donate
all that money

10:39.544 --> 10:42.312
To this stupid clinic of yours?

10:44.916 --> 10:46.516
- Ooh!
- Sorry.

10:47.318 --> 10:49.319
- What was that about?

10:49.988 --> 10:50.954
(scoffs)

10:52.157 --> 10:53.823
- I suppose you know
why I've brought you in.

10:53.925 --> 10:55.558
- I do and I'm shocked.

10:55.660 --> 10:56.960
Aren't you a married man?

10:57.062 --> 10:59.162
- Don't get cheeky with me.

10:59.264 --> 11:01.897
I know a career criminal
when I see one.

11:01.900 --> 11:04.167
Constance weatherly
was murdered to save you

11:04.268 --> 11:05.468
From an arranged marriage.

11:05.470 --> 11:06.802
- Not by me, she wasn't.

11:06.905 --> 11:08.505
- By your criminal
acquaintances.

11:08.606 --> 11:11.041
- I have loyal friends.
Is that a crime?

11:11.142 --> 11:13.843
- No, but stabbing a man
in the neck

11:13.845 --> 11:15.311
With an oyster shucker is.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.513
- Poor mick.

11:16.614 --> 11:18.915
Don't know why anyone
would deal him such a fate,

11:18.917 --> 11:19.783
But wasn't me.

11:19.884 --> 11:21.650
I wasn't even there
when that happened.

11:22.087 --> 11:24.187
- So you claim.
- And to god.

11:24.189 --> 11:26.455
Finished my shift
at the piano and went home.

11:26.458 --> 11:28.324
- Have you any witnesses
to that?

11:28.426 --> 11:30.560
- No. But I wasn't
at the bar.

11:30.562 --> 11:32.328
Ask anyone.
- I will.

11:32.330 --> 11:33.629
- All right, then.

11:34.365 --> 11:36.699
- Well, what's this supposed
to prove then?

11:36.702 --> 11:38.801
- This device uses
ultraviolet light

11:38.903 --> 11:40.737
In order to detect evidence

11:40.739 --> 11:43.740
That may not be visible
to the naked eye.

11:44.843 --> 11:46.676
(chuckling)
(gasping)

11:51.048 --> 11:52.081
(woman): Huh!

11:52.650 --> 11:54.884
- Mm, look at those
pretty colours.

11:55.854 --> 12:00.590
- These "pretty colours" are
traces of where blood has been.

12:00.692 --> 12:02.158
- This was a group stabbing?

12:02.260 --> 12:03.626
- No, you git.

12:03.728 --> 12:05.028
Shucking's risky business.

12:05.030 --> 12:06.396
Show him your scars.

12:07.365 --> 12:08.364
- Mm-hmm.

12:09.234 --> 12:11.301
- Mm-hmm. It's no mystery

12:11.303 --> 12:13.203
Why those knives are bloody.

12:16.607 --> 12:17.640
- Right.

12:17.642 --> 12:18.908
I would like
to have another look

12:19.010 --> 12:21.177
At your cold storage room,
please.

12:32.423 --> 12:34.691
(sighing)
here as well.

12:39.831 --> 12:42.432
Wait. Come back.
- What is it?

12:45.003 --> 12:46.068
- Hmm.

12:46.905 --> 12:52.275
Appears to be a buildup of
residue from dirty palm prints.

12:52.277 --> 12:54.611
- That's a strange place to be
gripping the wall, sir.

12:54.712 --> 12:55.879
- Indeed.

12:56.781 --> 13:00.083
Perhaps that's because
it's not just a wall.

13:00.185 --> 13:02.118
(knocking)

13:04.255 --> 13:07.223
Ah! Toronto constabulary!

13:07.325 --> 13:08.424
Open up!
(knocking)

13:08.426 --> 13:09.492
(footsteps receding)

13:11.096 --> 13:12.529
(grunts)

13:14.166 --> 13:15.364
Police! Halt!

13:15.367 --> 13:17.500
- Sir, it's him!
The moustache man!

13:19.103 --> 13:21.104
Oh, sir, look.

13:21.206 --> 13:22.638
Blood.

13:22.641 --> 13:24.941
(panting)

13:28.479 --> 13:30.980
- Your name, sir?
- Harry hayes.

13:31.082 --> 13:33.382
- And what is your role here?

13:33.385 --> 13:34.851
- Protecting the girls.

13:34.853 --> 13:36.586
- Prote... From what?

13:36.687 --> 13:38.254
The customers?

13:38.590 --> 13:40.389
- If necessary, yeah.

13:40.926 --> 13:45.128
- Was it necessary last night?
- No. No, no, no.

13:45.230 --> 13:47.396
Um, last night was easy as pie.

13:47.498 --> 13:49.265
- Not for mick peterson.

13:51.102 --> 13:52.135
- Yeah.

13:52.703 --> 13:53.870
Poor mick.

13:54.438 --> 13:57.273
Well, I guess that was his blood
on the stairs?

13:58.310 --> 14:00.710
Anyways, a bloody staircase
is bad for business,

14:00.811 --> 14:03.947
So when I noticed it today,
I figured I'd mop it up.

14:05.417 --> 14:08.351
- Did you happen to hear
any voices or commotion

14:08.453 --> 14:10.019
Coming from here?

14:10.121 --> 14:11.754
- No, that door's pretty thick.

14:11.856 --> 14:13.990
- And you didn't see the bloody
stairs last night?

14:14.091 --> 14:16.359
- Nah. No, uh, we use
the front staircase.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.728
Customers use the ba... Ack.

14:21.132 --> 14:23.833
- What exactly is upstairs?

14:26.071 --> 14:28.771
(clears throat)
- my office is the red door

14:28.873 --> 14:30.439
At the end of the corridor.

14:30.942 --> 14:32.642
- And these other rooms?

14:32.644 --> 14:35.445
- They appear to be
sleeping quarters, sir.

14:35.447 --> 14:36.845
- Right.

14:36.848 --> 14:38.114
That's it.

14:38.216 --> 14:39.649
I mean, sleeping quarters.

14:39.750 --> 14:42.886
For when the girls
get... Sleepy.

14:45.223 --> 14:48.057
All right! It's a bordello.

14:48.593 --> 14:50.192
- Henry, search the rooms.

14:50.962 --> 14:53.863
You didn't mention
a bordello last night.

14:53.865 --> 14:55.865
- Yeah, because my girls
aren't hurting anybody!

14:55.967 --> 14:58.267
This place keeps them
off the streets.

14:58.369 --> 15:00.870
- Ms. Malone, I assure you
I am only interested

15:00.972 --> 15:03.272
In finding
mr. Peterson's killer.

15:03.875 --> 15:06.943
- So, you're not arresting me
for running a bawdy house?

15:06.945 --> 15:08.478
- Not if you cooperate.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.946
- Well, what do you want
to know?

15:10.047 --> 15:13.816
- The names of the clients that
were upstairs here last night.

15:13.918 --> 15:15.485
- Names?
(scoffs)

15:15.586 --> 15:17.353
I barely know their faces!

15:17.455 --> 15:19.088
They all look the same to me.

15:19.090 --> 15:20.689
And I wasn't up here.

15:20.692 --> 15:22.191
Ask anybody.

15:23.028 --> 15:24.661
(indistinct chatter)

15:25.863 --> 15:27.497
- Miss mackeen?

15:28.900 --> 15:32.035
Did you see mother malone
at the bordello last night?

15:32.871 --> 15:34.337
- What bordello?

15:35.807 --> 15:37.306
- There is no need
for deception.

15:37.408 --> 15:40.510
I have a fairly good idea
of what's going on here.

15:40.611 --> 15:41.911
Now, did you see her?

15:43.982 --> 15:46.248
- I quit working upstairs
a while ago.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.184
I'm strictly behind the bar now.

15:52.556 --> 15:53.856
(clears throat)

15:53.858 --> 15:54.991
- Ladies!

15:55.593 --> 15:58.527
I am aware that there is
a bordello operating

15:58.530 --> 16:00.463
On the second floor here.

16:00.465 --> 16:03.466
Now, I am willing to overlook
this illicit activity

16:03.468 --> 16:05.601
If you provide me with
the names of the clients

16:05.603 --> 16:08.404
You had upstairs
with you last night.

16:19.250 --> 16:22.552
The killer must have tilted
the barrel against the stairs,

16:22.653 --> 16:26.155
And then rolled peterson's body
down into it.

16:26.157 --> 16:28.624
- And there's a bordello
on the second floor.

16:28.626 --> 16:30.159
- Yes, but none of the women

16:30.161 --> 16:32.628
Will divulge the identities
of their clients.

16:32.630 --> 16:33.962
- Doesn't matter.

16:33.965 --> 16:35.698
I know who the killer is.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.066
Thank you, higgins.

16:37.668 --> 16:39.302
- I barely got settled
in my cell

16:39.404 --> 16:41.037
And you're already
dragging me back here.

16:41.138 --> 16:42.572
He's smitten.

16:43.808 --> 16:45.308
- You never told me
about the bordello.

16:45.410 --> 16:47.643
- You want to schedule a romp?

16:47.645 --> 16:48.945
- You lied to me.

16:49.047 --> 16:50.713
You weren't at home
the night of the murder.

16:50.815 --> 16:52.848
You were upstairs.
- You got me.

16:52.851 --> 16:55.718
I'm a working girl.
Surprise, surprise.

16:55.820 --> 16:57.253
But I'm not a murderer.

16:57.354 --> 16:59.721
- I don't believe you.
- Fair enough.

16:59.724 --> 17:01.290
Maybe you'll believe him.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.595
- Constable tucker?
- Yeah.

17:05.597 --> 17:07.363
Who do you think I went
upstairs with?

17:08.032 --> 17:08.965
- Oh...

17:08.967 --> 17:11.033
- Higgins, take this one
back to the cells

17:11.036 --> 17:12.468
'til I sort this out.

17:13.370 --> 17:15.171
Tucker, in here now!

17:20.177 --> 17:21.644
- I gotta go.
The boss needs me.

17:21.746 --> 17:22.745
- All right, sweetie.

17:23.247 --> 17:24.380
- Sharpish!

17:27.852 --> 17:29.352
- Is that your fiancée?

17:29.987 --> 17:30.953
- Yes, sir.

17:31.989 --> 17:33.956
- We just spoke
to madeline tomkins.

17:35.426 --> 17:36.992
- Is there something
you'd like to--

17:37.094 --> 17:38.528
- I'm sorry I lied!

17:39.364 --> 17:40.896
I wasn't blacked out in the loo.

17:40.899 --> 17:42.698
I-I was with her.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.133
Th-that woman, I...

17:45.170 --> 17:46.836
Please don't tell my fiancée.

17:46.937 --> 17:48.303
- You should be more concerned

17:48.306 --> 17:49.906
With the prospect
of going to prison.

17:50.007 --> 17:51.440
- Prison?

17:51.442 --> 17:53.242
For what?
- Murder.

17:53.344 --> 17:54.944
You fought with peterson
that night.

17:55.046 --> 17:56.512
- Yeah, he bloodied my nose,

17:56.514 --> 17:57.814
But I probably deserved it.

17:58.483 --> 17:59.749
I didn't kill him.

18:01.051 --> 18:03.319
- You had no further dealings
with mr. Peterson?

18:03.321 --> 18:04.420
- No.

18:06.324 --> 18:09.859
Except I passed him later
in the corridor.

18:09.861 --> 18:11.661
- What corridor?

18:12.864 --> 18:13.963
- Upstairs.

18:15.767 --> 18:18.133
- Was he with a woman?
- No.

18:18.136 --> 18:19.535
No, alone.

18:19.637 --> 18:21.270
Heading towards the red door
at the end of the hall

18:21.372 --> 18:22.605
When I was heading back
downstairs.

18:23.675 --> 18:25.775
I didn't kill him,
detective murdoch.

18:25.877 --> 18:27.242
Sir, you gotta believe me.

18:27.245 --> 18:31.547
- No, I don't "gotta believe"
anything, constable tucker!

18:31.649 --> 18:33.416
You've already lied to me,

18:33.518 --> 18:36.151
Therefore, I will be holding you
in our cells

18:36.154 --> 18:38.855
Until we find out
who killed mr. Peterson.

18:44.061 --> 18:45.428
- It makes me want to weep.

18:45.530 --> 18:48.631
- Makes me want to wring
eleanor pinch's neck.

18:48.732 --> 18:49.966
- What's wrong?
(scoffs)

18:50.067 --> 18:52.568
- Mrs. Pinch gave
a slanderous account

18:52.670 --> 18:54.971
Of her alleged mistreatment
here at the clinic.

18:56.841 --> 18:59.108
- "'dr. Ogden was dismissive
of my condition

18:59.210 --> 19:00.643
And refused to treat me,'

19:00.645 --> 19:02.444
Said the tearful mrs. Pinch."

19:02.546 --> 19:03.779
- Ugh.
- "so I sought help

19:03.881 --> 19:05.647
From dr. Jasper katz
at toronto general,

19:05.650 --> 19:07.183
Who provided me
with the medication

19:07.284 --> 19:08.584
I so desperately required."

19:08.686 --> 19:09.785
That's ridiculous!

19:09.887 --> 19:11.854
She doesn't desperately
require cocaine!

19:11.956 --> 19:13.723
- This part boils my blood.

19:13.824 --> 19:16.659
"the beleaguered charity
organizer further describes

19:16.760 --> 19:18.661
Profound regret
for donating money

19:18.663 --> 19:20.997
To the new women's clinic,
which she regards

19:20.999 --> 19:23.266
As a 'haven for quacks'."

19:23.367 --> 19:25.101
- What are you going to do,
dr. Ogden?

19:26.237 --> 19:27.403
(sighing)

19:27.405 --> 19:30.139
- Well, I guess I'm going
to keep my chin up

19:30.141 --> 19:31.807
And continue to serve
the medical needs

19:31.909 --> 19:33.609
Of the women of ontario.

19:33.711 --> 19:35.211
What else can I do?

19:35.312 --> 19:37.413
- Well, if it were up to me,

19:37.514 --> 19:40.816
I'd March down
to that gaudy mansion of hers

19:40.818 --> 19:42.885
And smack mrs. Eleanor pinch

19:42.987 --> 19:45.688
Right across her smug
little face.

19:45.789 --> 19:47.557
(chuckling)

19:47.658 --> 19:49.492
- Well, that's not
a course of action

19:49.594 --> 19:51.293
That I would recommend,
margaret.

19:51.395 --> 19:53.296
However tempting.
- Hmm.

19:57.802 --> 20:01.036
- Madeline tomkins
and constable tucker

20:01.039 --> 20:03.306
Have corroborated
each other's alibis.

20:03.308 --> 20:04.507
- Right.

20:04.609 --> 20:07.243
So, they were upstairs "at it".

20:07.245 --> 20:08.510
You know, murdoch?

20:08.612 --> 20:11.447
"at it", bone to bone,
flesh on flesh.

20:11.549 --> 20:13.215
Indulging in the bit
of the old--

20:13.218 --> 20:15.851
- I believe I understand
what you're grinding at.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.253
(clears throat)
(chuckling)

20:17.755 --> 20:22.124
My point is that
constable tucker saw peterson

20:22.226 --> 20:23.526
On the second floor.

20:24.162 --> 20:26.329
- Why was peterson upstairs?

20:26.831 --> 20:28.864
- That is unknown,

20:28.966 --> 20:31.801
But tucker did see him
near mother's office.

20:31.902 --> 20:34.603
So, I'm bringing her in
for questioning tomorrow.

20:34.705 --> 20:35.871
- Good.

20:35.973 --> 20:37.340
(indistinct chatter)

20:38.576 --> 20:41.209
- I very much enjoyed
our dinner last evening.

20:41.212 --> 20:44.013
- Well, and I very much
enjoyed our dessert.

20:44.782 --> 20:46.482
Perhaps after we visit
the starbright,

20:46.484 --> 20:48.884
We can adjourn to my house.

20:49.887 --> 20:51.620
- For more dessert?

20:51.722 --> 20:53.756
- Oh, my sweet tooth
is ravenous.

20:59.663 --> 21:01.030
Ooh.
- Are you cold?

21:01.131 --> 21:02.564
Here, take my jacket.

21:02.666 --> 21:03.699
- I left a shawl at work.

21:03.801 --> 21:05.401
It's just around the corner.

21:13.410 --> 21:15.177
Wait outside.
I'll only be a second.

21:15.279 --> 21:16.379
- Okay.

21:20.785 --> 21:22.285
(sighing)

21:24.488 --> 21:25.988
(clattering)

21:28.726 --> 21:30.226
- Is someone here?

21:30.728 --> 21:32.662
(footsteps receding)

21:37.301 --> 21:38.668
Hello?

21:43.574 --> 21:45.241
(indistinct chatter)

21:47.845 --> 21:48.844
- Hey, you!

21:49.580 --> 21:50.579
What's wrong?

21:59.290 --> 22:01.390
(sighing)
- isaiah!

22:02.160 --> 22:03.292
- Violet!

22:03.394 --> 22:04.493
Are you all right?

22:04.595 --> 22:06.562
- Yes, just a bit shaken.

22:06.663 --> 22:09.131
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

22:14.471 --> 22:15.338
(gasps)

22:18.910 --> 22:19.809
(sighing)

22:21.345 --> 22:22.444
As you can see,

22:22.546 --> 22:24.947
The intruder sliced
into mr. Peterson's torso.

22:25.049 --> 22:26.649
- For what purpose?

22:26.651 --> 22:28.017
- Let's find out.

22:29.153 --> 22:30.252
- Ew.

22:30.354 --> 22:32.054
And this is where
I take my leave.

22:32.156 --> 22:33.389
Good evening, violet.

22:33.491 --> 22:35.658
- Until next time, isaiah.

22:40.297 --> 22:44.467
- Was desecrating the corpse
a form of retaliation?

22:45.369 --> 22:47.602
Was the killer making
a statement?

22:48.439 --> 22:53.342
Or was this an ill-conceived
attempt at concealing

22:53.444 --> 22:56.345
Some particular form of poison.

22:57.047 --> 22:58.647
- This can't be.

22:59.217 --> 23:00.049
- What is it?

23:00.885 --> 23:03.152
- This man is a human oyster.

23:14.966 --> 23:17.299
- Your husband is a police
detective?

23:17.401 --> 23:19.335
- Toronto's finest.

23:22.273 --> 23:23.506
- And you are?

23:23.607 --> 23:25.374
- Uh, millicent drysdale, sir.

23:25.476 --> 23:27.109
- Miss drysdale is observing me

23:27.111 --> 23:28.844
As a part of her
medical education.

23:28.946 --> 23:29.912
- Oh!

23:30.014 --> 23:33.249
Well, then you must know
that dr. Ogden

23:33.251 --> 23:35.451
Is truly toronto's finest.

23:35.887 --> 23:38.187
- Why would you x-ray
a bunch of pearls?

23:38.856 --> 23:41.256
- Well, there's something odd
about these.

23:41.259 --> 23:45.861
Pearls typically are irregular
in shape and vary in sizes.

23:45.863 --> 23:50.399
These are all perfectly
spherical and identical in size.

23:50.401 --> 23:53.068
- Where are they from?
- From the murdered man,

23:53.170 --> 23:55.804
Who was found at the bordello
where constable tucker's

23:55.806 --> 23:57.339
Bachelor party was being held.

23:57.441 --> 23:58.941
- Bordello?

23:58.943 --> 23:59.975
But...

24:00.478 --> 24:02.511
Thomas organized that party.

24:03.113 --> 24:04.146
- I believe so.

24:04.248 --> 24:05.548
- Huh.
(chuckling)

24:06.316 --> 24:10.219
My husband took his constables
to a bordello!?

24:11.855 --> 24:12.655
(scoffs)

24:12.756 --> 24:14.957
(laughing)

24:15.059 --> 24:16.559
(sighing)

24:26.304 --> 24:28.204
- Where did you obtain
these pearls?

24:29.774 --> 24:32.575
- From the stomach
of a murder victim.

24:32.676 --> 24:35.177
- Good heavens. Oh, my...

24:36.347 --> 24:39.648
- Are these pearls valuable?
- That depends.

24:39.650 --> 24:42.584
Natural pearls are rare
and extremely valuable.

24:42.686 --> 24:45.120
Cultured pearls were invented
by the japanese

24:45.122 --> 24:47.089
And are slightly less so.

24:48.092 --> 24:51.460
I find this whole matter
quite distasteful.

24:51.462 --> 24:53.795
- Yes, it was
a gruesome discovery.

24:53.897 --> 24:56.365
- I was referring
to pearl cultivation.

24:58.102 --> 25:00.502
Can you imagine
the unwashed throats

25:00.505 --> 25:04.440
Of the hoi polloi draped
in cheap, cultured pearls?

25:05.610 --> 25:07.877
It makes me want to vomit.

25:08.613 --> 25:10.212
(coughs)

25:12.450 --> 25:13.816
These are cultured.

25:15.953 --> 25:19.088
- Who supplies cultured pearls
here in toronto?

25:20.457 --> 25:22.824
There is only one man I know of

25:22.826 --> 25:25.093
Who is trying to sell
these locally.

25:25.096 --> 25:27.229
I booted him from my shop.

25:27.331 --> 25:29.230
- What's his name?
- I didn't ask.

25:29.233 --> 25:32.701
He was a tall,
beer-bloated ruffian

25:32.703 --> 25:34.370
Who reeked of fish.

25:34.805 --> 25:36.839
- Any idea where he's from?

25:36.941 --> 25:40.643
- He said prince edward island.

25:47.919 --> 25:49.485
(indistinct chatter)

25:50.922 --> 25:52.187
- Uh, excuse me.

26:00.230 --> 26:02.331
Hey! Wh-what were you doing

26:02.333 --> 26:03.732
Outside the morgue
last night, huh?

26:03.734 --> 26:05.067
- Let me go!

26:05.570 --> 26:08.671
Help! This man's trying
to kidnap me!

26:08.772 --> 26:09.938
Help!

26:10.040 --> 26:11.139
Police!

26:11.142 --> 26:12.875
- Mr. Buchanan,
what's going on here?

26:12.977 --> 26:14.143
(sighing)

26:19.349 --> 26:20.749
(groans)

26:20.751 --> 26:22.851
- Good afternoon,
miss mackeen.

26:23.520 --> 26:24.753
- Is it?

26:25.489 --> 26:26.689
- You're unwell?

26:26.790 --> 26:27.956
(sighing)

26:28.058 --> 26:29.625
- Just a touch
of the bottle ache.

26:29.726 --> 26:31.893
- Comes with the territory.

26:31.895 --> 26:34.263
Here you go, darlin'!
Hair of the dog.

26:34.365 --> 26:35.764
Fix you right up.

26:35.866 --> 26:37.966
(chuckling)
- thank you, mother.

26:37.968 --> 26:39.034
- Mm-hmm.

26:41.038 --> 26:42.404
- Oh!

26:43.107 --> 26:43.973
(scoffs)

26:45.810 --> 26:46.975
(chuckling)

26:47.077 --> 26:48.977
- That child cannot handle
her liquor.

26:49.079 --> 26:50.846
What can I do for you,
detective?

26:50.948 --> 26:53.048
- Who supplies your oysters?

26:53.150 --> 26:55.784
- Ah. A mr. Dabney firkser
supplies us.

26:55.886 --> 26:58.654
Why?
- Does he also deal in pearls?

27:00.558 --> 27:02.825
- Does this look like
a jewelry store to you?

27:03.694 --> 27:06.261
- Our coroner found
20 cultured pearls

27:06.263 --> 27:08.397
In mr. Peterson's stomach.

27:08.399 --> 27:10.933
- He swallowed pearls? Why?

27:11.035 --> 27:13.669
I mean, mick wasn't the sharpest
pin in the cushion,

27:13.671 --> 27:16.138
But surely, he-he...

27:16.707 --> 27:19.742
- I believe he stole them
and was hiding them.

27:19.744 --> 27:21.243
From you.

27:21.846 --> 27:23.478
(chuckling)
- really?

27:23.981 --> 27:27.549
Where'd you cook up
that giant pot of twaddle?

27:27.651 --> 27:30.619
- Mr. Peterson was seen
near your office

27:30.621 --> 27:32.855
The night of his murder.
- Hmm.

27:33.924 --> 27:37.159
Well, mick was always
hurting for money.

27:37.161 --> 27:39.228
Could've been trying
to steal from me.

27:39.230 --> 27:41.697
But if I had a hoard
of pearls stashed away,

27:41.699 --> 27:43.632
Would I still be slinging
cheap whisky

27:43.734 --> 27:45.234
For a bunch of drooling drunks?

27:49.139 --> 27:50.972
- What about this mr. Firkser?

27:51.074 --> 27:53.175
Did mr. Peterson know him?

27:53.276 --> 27:54.943
- Uh, you know,
come to think of it,

27:54.945 --> 27:56.245
I think he did.

27:56.346 --> 27:59.114
- And was this mr. Firkser here

27:59.216 --> 28:01.383
The night of
mr. Peterson's murder?

28:02.720 --> 28:05.254
- I didn't see him.
I mean, could've been.

28:05.355 --> 28:06.822
It was pretty busy that night.

28:07.391 --> 28:08.724
- Hmm.

28:08.825 --> 28:10.292
Where might I find him?

28:11.828 --> 28:14.329
- Sir, buster farley is waiting
for you in the interview room.

28:14.331 --> 28:15.664
- Just give me one minute.

28:16.500 --> 28:17.933
(laughing)

28:18.035 --> 28:19.868
Margaret! To what do I owe
the pleasure?

28:19.970 --> 28:22.971
- You took your constables
to a bordello?!

28:25.609 --> 28:27.409
- I took them to an oyster bar.

28:27.411 --> 28:30.012
- So, you're telling me
detective murdoch lied to me?

28:30.014 --> 28:33.348
Because I distinctly remember
him saying "bordello"!

28:33.350 --> 28:35.416
- Well, you see, margaret,
it was both.

28:35.419 --> 28:37.219
And I didn't know
about the bordello part.

28:37.321 --> 28:40.022
- How could you not know?
You are the police inspector.

28:40.124 --> 28:41.423
- I just didn't!

28:41.525 --> 28:43.358
And even if it is part bordello,

28:43.460 --> 28:45.894
I didn't partake in anything
but oysters and whisky.

28:45.896 --> 28:49.264
- Oh, I find that
very difficult to believe.

28:49.266 --> 28:50.832
- The world is full of things

28:50.835 --> 28:52.567
That you find difficult
to believe

28:52.570 --> 28:54.369
And I can't relieve you
of that burden right now

28:54.371 --> 28:56.705
Because I have to go interrogate
an eight-year-old.

28:56.707 --> 28:58.974
(groans)
now if you'll excuse me?

28:58.976 --> 28:59.875
(gasps)

29:01.512 --> 29:02.611
(groans)

29:03.514 --> 29:04.646
(sighing)

29:06.050 --> 29:07.583
- An eight-year-old?

29:08.385 --> 29:09.318
Wha...?

29:10.220 --> 29:12.520
- Oh, I didn't do nothing wrong.

29:12.523 --> 29:14.523
I wasn't near no morgue.

29:14.525 --> 29:16.258
- You better not lie to me, son.

29:17.093 --> 29:18.327
- Or what?

29:18.329 --> 29:19.661
- You'll hang.

29:20.230 --> 29:21.396
- You wouldn't.

29:22.066 --> 29:25.733
- My hangman has got
this tiny wee noose

29:25.736 --> 29:28.103
That would fit perfectly
around your neck

29:28.105 --> 29:30.172
And he's just itching
to test it.

29:31.842 --> 29:34.977
- I was paid a pack of bellboys
to stand there and be a lookout.

29:35.445 --> 29:36.812
- A lookout?

29:36.913 --> 29:38.347
But you were just
approaching the morgue

29:38.448 --> 29:39.914
When you were spotted.

29:39.917 --> 29:41.216
- Had to bum a light.

29:41.318 --> 29:42.651
- Oh, I see.

29:43.087 --> 29:44.352
I'll tell you what:

29:44.355 --> 29:47.623
I'll let you go if you can
describe who hired you.

29:48.091 --> 29:49.758
- I can even draw you a picture.

29:49.760 --> 29:50.625
- Perfect.

29:50.628 --> 29:52.026
- For a quarter.

29:52.029 --> 29:53.228
(laughing)

29:53.230 --> 29:54.997
- Let's see what we've got.

29:57.167 --> 29:58.399
There you go!

29:58.402 --> 30:00.302
I'll get you a pencil and paper.

30:08.879 --> 30:10.312
(knocking on door)

30:10.314 --> 30:12.447
- Dabney firkser?
Toronto constabulary.

30:12.449 --> 30:14.082
We'd like a word.

30:16.220 --> 30:17.853
(knocking on door)

30:17.855 --> 30:19.054
Mr. Firkser!

30:20.824 --> 30:22.624
This is your final warning!

30:45.248 --> 30:47.548
And that's when I found
firkser at the flophouse.

30:47.551 --> 30:50.151
From the looks of it,
he'd been dead several days.

30:50.154 --> 30:52.120
- So, we may be talking
double murder.

30:53.790 --> 30:54.990
Have you lost your mind,

30:55.091 --> 30:56.691
Telling my wife
about the bordello?

30:56.694 --> 30:59.494
- Can we finish discussing
the peterson murder case first?

31:00.097 --> 31:02.965
- I've already solved the bloody
peterson murder.

31:03.434 --> 31:04.699
Margaret is furious.

31:04.801 --> 31:05.834
What were you thinking?

31:05.936 --> 31:08.704
- I'd assumed you'd told her
about the bordello.

31:08.805 --> 31:10.806
And how did you solve
the murder case?

31:10.808 --> 31:12.640
- Have you met my wife?

31:13.410 --> 31:15.577
Why the hell would I tell her
about the bordello?

31:18.148 --> 31:20.883
I solved the murder based
on an eyewitness description.

31:23.120 --> 31:24.653
- I found her, inspector!

31:35.966 --> 31:38.133
- I didn't kill mick peterson.

31:38.135 --> 31:40.802
- But you admit that you
desecrated his corpse.

31:40.904 --> 31:42.203
- Yeah.

31:42.305 --> 31:43.939
Sorry about that.

31:44.674 --> 31:46.675
- So, you knew about the pearls.

31:49.580 --> 31:50.579
(sighing)

31:51.548 --> 31:53.682
- I caught mick upstairs
counting 'em.

31:53.783 --> 31:56.284
He said he was gonna cash
the pearls in to buy a house.

31:56.286 --> 31:57.886
Then I said, "you got so many,

31:57.988 --> 31:59.620
Why aren't you giving me
some of those?"

31:59.623 --> 32:01.623
Which is when he gulped
the whole lot down!

32:01.725 --> 32:04.226
- Where did he get them?
- He wouldn't say.

32:04.328 --> 32:06.294
But after he was dead,
I thought to myself,

32:06.297 --> 32:08.430
"bleedin' 'ell!
Mick don't need 'em anymore.

32:08.531 --> 32:10.632
Maybe I could
buy myself a house."

32:10.968 --> 32:13.368
- So, you tried
to rob the corpse.

32:14.938 --> 32:16.904
- Not my proudest moment.

32:16.907 --> 32:18.973
- What about dabney firkser?

32:18.976 --> 32:20.308
Did you kill him?

32:20.410 --> 32:21.476
- Who?

32:22.379 --> 32:25.113
- The man who supplied
the oysters to mother malone.

32:25.115 --> 32:27.783
- How could I kill someone
I never met?

32:31.388 --> 32:33.655
- "an anonymous source
tells the telegraph

32:33.757 --> 32:35.857
That mrs. Eleanor pinch
was not, in fact,

32:35.859 --> 32:38.793
Ill when she demanded cocaine
from dr. Julia ogden,

32:38.796 --> 32:41.196
Unless one would call
the depraved appetite

32:41.297 --> 32:43.532
Of a drug addict an illness."

32:43.633 --> 32:45.667
Well, actually,
I would call it that.

32:47.004 --> 32:49.604
- So this at least casts doubt.

32:49.606 --> 32:51.273
- Well, I don't care
about that, william.

32:51.375 --> 32:54.676
Patient confidentiality,
on the other hand, is sacred!

32:55.178 --> 32:57.079
Someone at the women's clinic
has violated

32:57.180 --> 32:59.814
All professional standards
by leaking this.

32:59.817 --> 33:03.351
- And do you know
who that someone is?

33:03.354 --> 33:05.420
- Unfortunately, yes.

33:05.422 --> 33:06.822
I believe I do.

33:08.124 --> 33:10.191
- Mr. Firkser was strangled.

33:10.894 --> 33:13.028
- Have you established
a time of death?

33:13.130 --> 33:15.297
- I can't say precisely,
but he was dead

33:15.299 --> 33:17.365
At least four days
before you found him.

33:17.467 --> 33:19.701
- Well before
mr. Peterson's death.

33:19.803 --> 33:22.938
- You think the same man killed
both peterson and firkser, sir?

33:23.040 --> 33:24.239
- It's possible.

33:24.341 --> 33:27.442
Miss hart, has your postmortem
revealed any clues

33:27.544 --> 33:29.911
As to our murderer's identity?

33:29.913 --> 33:31.946
- Well, as the bruises indicate,

33:31.949 --> 33:34.382
The killer was quite strong
and strangled mr. Firkser

33:34.384 --> 33:35.583
With his bare hands.

33:35.586 --> 33:37.652
And these distinctive
indentations reveal

33:37.754 --> 33:39.721
He was wearing several rings.

33:39.723 --> 33:43.658
- So, our killer had strong
hands and wore rings.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.261
- I know someone who fits
that description.

33:47.664 --> 33:49.197
But she's all woman.

33:52.069 --> 33:53.869
- You want me to do what?

33:58.374 --> 34:01.810
- Wrap your hands around
the clay and squeeze.

34:01.911 --> 34:03.011
Like this.

34:03.981 --> 34:05.080
(sighing)

34:08.619 --> 34:10.052
- How's that?

34:18.895 --> 34:20.295
- Let's try again.

34:20.396 --> 34:22.731
And this time,
stop when I say so.

34:23.734 --> 34:24.800
- Hmm.

34:24.901 --> 34:26.935
Arts and crafts day, is it?

34:27.504 --> 34:28.770
- Just do it.

34:30.406 --> 34:31.706
(sighing)

34:31.808 --> 34:32.741
Enough!

34:45.422 --> 34:46.787
As I suspected.

34:47.424 --> 34:49.524
- You suspected
that clay is mushy?

34:49.626 --> 34:50.925
(chuckling)

34:50.928 --> 34:52.727
Crackerjack work, pally.

34:55.833 --> 34:58.400
- You killed dabney firkser.

34:59.169 --> 35:03.805
The marks left on his neck
match the indentations

35:03.807 --> 35:06.674
Caused by the rings
on your fingers.

35:06.776 --> 35:08.844
You strangled him to death.

35:13.183 --> 35:15.750
- I hate a braggart, don't you?

35:16.586 --> 35:18.886
- I find hate counterproductive.

35:19.489 --> 35:22.090
- Well, la-de-dah,
saint murdoch.

35:22.192 --> 35:25.426
(chuckling)
anyhow, loudmouth dabney

35:25.528 --> 35:27.362
Kept blabbing on
about his precious pearls

35:27.464 --> 35:29.430
And how much money he was going
to make off of 'em,

35:29.433 --> 35:32.467
And as I was saying,
I hate a braggart.

35:33.069 --> 35:34.836
But I love money.

35:34.938 --> 35:36.638
So I stole them.

35:37.441 --> 35:41.042
He caught me doing it
and he attacked me.

35:41.712 --> 35:44.179
- He attacked you?
- Yeah.

35:44.280 --> 35:47.249
So I strangled him to death
in self-defence.

35:49.786 --> 35:53.188
- We'll let the courts decide
the validity of those claims.

35:53.190 --> 35:55.523
So, you killed firkser.

35:55.959 --> 35:58.727
You then discovered
that peterson had stolen

35:58.729 --> 35:59.861
The pearls from you.

35:59.963 --> 36:01.462
So, again...
(scoffs)

36:01.465 --> 36:02.863
- Whoa, there.

36:02.866 --> 36:04.532
I did not kill mick.

36:04.634 --> 36:07.402
He was annoying as hell,
but a true kind soul.

36:07.503 --> 36:09.004
Can't believe he stole from me.

36:09.105 --> 36:11.006
I didn't think he had it in him.

36:11.107 --> 36:13.141
- When we examined
his dead body,

36:13.243 --> 36:16.244
He literally had
the pearls in him.

36:18.382 --> 36:19.915
- Well, that could have been

36:20.016 --> 36:21.749
Why he was following me
around all night,

36:21.851 --> 36:24.219
Trying to figure out
where I'd hid them.

36:24.320 --> 36:27.955
Lately, he'd been going on
and on about, you know,

36:27.958 --> 36:29.891
Saving money to start a family.

36:29.993 --> 36:31.626
And I'd say to him,
"if that's the case,

36:31.628 --> 36:33.828
Why are you spending
like a drunken sailor

36:33.830 --> 36:35.630
At my oyster bar then?"

36:41.038 --> 36:43.305
- And the last patient
we'll see on our rounds today

36:43.307 --> 36:44.773
Is mrs. Takahara.

36:44.874 --> 36:47.642
- Who is... Recovering
from a caesarian section.

36:47.644 --> 36:49.310
- Yes. And I was thinking

36:49.412 --> 36:51.846
That you could perform
the examination.

36:51.848 --> 36:53.781
- Oh, could I?
- Mm-hmm.

36:53.784 --> 36:56.217
(knocking on door)
- julia, you wanted to see me?

36:56.219 --> 36:59.120
- Yes. Please come in
and close the door behind you.

37:00.356 --> 37:01.389
Take a seat.

37:01.391 --> 37:03.491
- Oh.
(sighing)

37:03.960 --> 37:05.393
What's this?

37:05.395 --> 37:07.061
- I think you know.

37:07.163 --> 37:09.264
And I appreciate
what you were trying to do

37:09.266 --> 37:10.932
By giving that interview.
- Interview?

37:11.034 --> 37:15.003
- However, it was a violation
of patient confidentiality.

37:15.104 --> 37:17.872
Unfortunately, margaret,
I'm going to have to dismiss you

37:17.974 --> 37:19.207
From your position here.

37:19.209 --> 37:21.943
- But I didn't give
any interview.

37:22.045 --> 37:23.878
- I know you did it
with the best of intentions,

37:23.980 --> 37:26.214
But I just can't sanction
that kind of behaviour.

37:27.784 --> 37:29.417
- I did no such thing.

37:29.519 --> 37:32.153
I am appalled
that you would accuse me.

37:32.255 --> 37:35.490
- If it wasn't you,
then who, margaret?

37:36.159 --> 37:36.991
(sighing)

37:36.994 --> 37:38.193
(door closing)

37:43.166 --> 37:44.598
(sighing)

37:45.269 --> 37:47.001
- So mother malone
killed firkser.

37:47.003 --> 37:48.569
What about peterson?

37:48.671 --> 37:50.171
- She claims she didn't.

37:50.173 --> 37:52.774
She says she didn't even know
he had the pearls.

37:52.875 --> 37:54.876
- Well, then,
it's gotta be madeline tomkins.

37:55.745 --> 37:57.579
- I'm not so sure about that.

37:59.615 --> 38:02.317
- He said he was gonna cash
the pearls in to buy a house.

38:02.419 --> 38:05.920
- Lately, he'd been going
on and on about, you know,

38:06.022 --> 38:08.189
Saving money to start a family.

38:08.758 --> 38:10.859
- I quit working upstairs
a while ago.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.127
I'm strictly behind the bar now.

38:13.229 --> 38:14.596
(chuckling)

38:17.534 --> 38:19.301
(sniffing)
oh!

38:21.971 --> 38:23.338
- So, who killed peterson?

38:23.440 --> 38:25.373
Madeline tomkins
or mother malone?

38:26.175 --> 38:28.043
- Maybe neither one of them.

38:34.751 --> 38:36.318
- Detective murdoch.

38:36.419 --> 38:37.651
What can I do for you?

38:37.654 --> 38:39.054
- Miss mackeen.

38:40.223 --> 38:42.324
How far along are you
in your pregnancy?

38:43.860 --> 38:46.594
- Pregnancy?
What are you on about?

38:47.297 --> 38:50.865
- I think you know precisely
what I am "on about".

38:53.069 --> 38:55.036
This is an interesting device.

38:55.605 --> 38:57.639
- It's a bung starter.

38:57.641 --> 38:59.707
Used to open the whisky barrels.

39:00.476 --> 39:03.044
- Also used to hammer shut
oyster barrels

39:03.146 --> 39:04.779
Containing dead bodies?

39:05.615 --> 39:07.182
- No, I don't know
what you're...

39:07.817 --> 39:10.518
- Why would you kill
the father of your child?

39:13.689 --> 39:15.156
- Mick peterson?

39:16.326 --> 39:18.093
Some father he'd have been.

39:18.828 --> 39:20.528
Drunk and penniless.

39:20.964 --> 39:23.932
Spouting phony declarations
of undying love.

39:24.901 --> 39:27.802
Then I see him following
mother around like a...

39:27.804 --> 39:30.138
Like a drooling pervert.

39:30.773 --> 39:33.274
Canoodling with maddie
right under my nose.

39:35.478 --> 39:37.011
- That made you angry.

39:37.013 --> 39:38.813
- Furious.

39:41.484 --> 39:42.951
So, I, uh...

39:43.586 --> 39:46.054
I followed him upstairs
to have a word.

39:47.657 --> 39:49.524
He was all apologies.

39:50.159 --> 39:51.559
"oh, diana...

39:52.796 --> 39:55.563
I'm gonna marry you
and buy us a house."

39:57.033 --> 39:58.767
The liar.

40:02.872 --> 40:05.840
I couldn't take the empty
promises no more.

40:06.910 --> 40:09.844
I lost my temper, and then
I swung at him with my shucker,

40:09.946 --> 40:11.880
But I didn't mean to kill him!

40:13.216 --> 40:14.582
(crying)

40:18.087 --> 40:20.387
- Not all of his promises
were empty.

40:21.258 --> 40:24.325
He could have bought you a house
with the pearls he had.

40:27.897 --> 40:29.030
- Pearls?

40:29.732 --> 40:31.065
What pearls?

40:39.442 --> 40:41.376
- That's excellent news.
Thank you.

40:42.412 --> 40:43.945
- I've brought you
the inmate, sir.

40:44.046 --> 40:45.613
- Thank you, higgins.

40:45.715 --> 40:49.150
- The inmate who's been locked
up in a jail cell for days now.

40:49.152 --> 40:51.151
- That's generally where
the inmates are kept, higgins.

40:51.154 --> 40:52.753
- Locked up like an animal.

40:52.756 --> 40:54.288
Eating jail food.

40:54.291 --> 40:56.691
- Higgins, that's enough.
Dismissed.

40:56.693 --> 40:57.959
- Oh, can't I watch?

40:58.061 --> 40:59.627
- Get out and shut the door!

40:59.729 --> 41:01.095
(sighing)
and put the kettle on!

41:01.097 --> 41:03.531
- Yes, sir.
- Have a seat, constable tucker.

41:04.768 --> 41:07.101
I guess you know
what I'm about to do?

41:07.203 --> 41:09.237
- Please don't fire me, sir!

41:10.440 --> 41:11.672
- Don't humiliate yourself.

41:11.774 --> 41:13.908
- Please. I need this job.

41:14.010 --> 41:15.910
- A constable needs
to conduct himself

41:16.012 --> 41:17.445
With dignity and integrity.

41:17.547 --> 41:19.514
- I was drunk. I'm sorry.

41:20.350 --> 41:22.717
Please, I'd never even been
with a woman before that night.

41:22.818 --> 41:24.585
I don't even know
that I did it right.

41:24.588 --> 41:25.653
- Jeez.

41:25.755 --> 41:27.155
- Please.

41:28.057 --> 41:31.025
I'll become a better man.
I promise.

41:31.928 --> 41:33.895
Please give me a second chance.

41:35.231 --> 41:37.532
- It's not me you need
to be begging to.

41:42.104 --> 41:43.671
- What's she doing here?

41:44.173 --> 41:47.342
- Waiting for an explanation
as to why you were in our cells.

41:51.481 --> 41:53.181
- What am I supposed
to tell her?

41:54.084 --> 41:55.583
- That's up to you.

41:59.022 --> 42:00.388
(sighing)

42:04.494 --> 42:05.693
- Thomas?

42:05.795 --> 42:06.728
- Margaret.

42:07.997 --> 42:10.364
- Oh. What's the occasion?

42:10.367 --> 42:13.734
- I need to tell you the honest
truth about that bachelor party.

42:13.836 --> 42:16.471
I didn't know about the bordello
when I took the lads there.

42:17.073 --> 42:18.306
I was naive.

42:18.308 --> 42:20.108
I'm sorry that I upset you.

42:21.878 --> 42:26.847
- No, thomas,
I'm sorry for accusing you.

42:26.850 --> 42:28.516
I know what it's like
to be blamed

42:28.618 --> 42:30.451
For something you didn't do.

42:30.453 --> 42:32.053
I quit my job today.

42:32.055 --> 42:33.854
- Why? What happened?

42:33.956 --> 42:36.190
- Uh, sorry for
the interruption.

42:36.826 --> 42:39.526
Tom, may I have a word
with your wife?

42:39.529 --> 42:40.895
- Of course.

42:41.898 --> 42:42.897
Ladies.

42:44.901 --> 42:46.401
- I'm so sorry, margaret.

42:46.403 --> 42:48.336
I jumped
to the wrong conclusion.

42:49.038 --> 42:51.472
We won't be working
with millicent any longer.

42:52.709 --> 42:54.609
- Ah.
(chuckling)

43:00.316 --> 43:01.282
- William.

43:02.051 --> 43:03.751
- Hello, julia.

43:03.853 --> 43:05.519
- Is susannah asleep?

43:05.621 --> 43:07.087
- Down for the night.
- Ah.

43:07.090 --> 43:08.689
What's all this?

43:08.792 --> 43:12.226
- You've been working very hard
running the clinic.

43:12.228 --> 43:16.697
Tonight, you should relax
and enjoy some oysters.

43:16.799 --> 43:19.100
- What a nice surprise.
Are they raw?

43:19.202 --> 43:20.568
- They are.

43:20.670 --> 43:25.907
I've heard that oysters have
aphrodisiac properties.

43:26.009 --> 43:28.843
- Uh, I don't think that
is scientifically proven.

43:28.944 --> 43:30.244
- I don't either.

43:30.246 --> 43:32.447
But we should at least
test out the theory.

43:32.548 --> 43:34.115
(chuckling)

43:42.525 --> 43:44.726
(♪♪)

44:08.084 --> 44:10.118
Subtitling: Difuze
