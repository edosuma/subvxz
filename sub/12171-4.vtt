- No.

07:23.543 --> 07:24.958

07:25.000 --> 07:26.459
- Reza's really, really, really,

07:26.460 --> 07:27.917
really, really, mad at me.

07:27.958 --> 07:29.375
- Well, not that mad,
- but he's mad

07:29.417 --> 07:31.292
- and he like, thought
- that it was like,

07:31.333 --> 07:33.542
me f... ing up or like...

07:33.583 --> 07:34.667
- Sounds like you did,

07:34.668 --> 07:35.750
a little bit.

07:35.792 --> 07:37.458
- Unintentionally.
- Yeah.

07:37.461 --> 07:38.583
- Yeah.
- But like, did he like,

07:38.625 --> 07:40.375
- explicitly say,
- "don't tell anybody about this,"

07:40.417 --> 07:42.292

- He said, "don't tell Adam."

07:43.500 --> 07:44.667

07:47.167 --> 07:48.458

07:50.667 --> 07:52.083
- I think it's a sh... Ty thing.
- Alright, okay.

07:52.125 --> 07:54.000
- I think it's a lousy idea
- and I hope he doesn't do it

07:54.042 --> 07:56.000
- but if he does,
- I'll support him.

07:56.003 --> 07:57.083
- You know, because I don't
- want him to think

07:57.125 --> 07:59.167
that I'm trying to hurt

07:59.208 --> 08:00.438
or be unsupportive

08:00.439 --> 08:01.667
of something this big.

08:01.708 --> 08:03.500
- If that's what he wants to do,
- that's their relationship,

08:03.542 --> 08:05.333
- let him do it.
- I told him I didn't think

08:05.375 --> 08:06.750
he should do that.

08:06.751 --> 08:08.125
- I don't think it's your place

08:08.167 --> 08:10.167
- really to tell him.
- Reza's our prince, you know?

08:10.208 --> 08:12.625
He should have a regal affair.

- Yeah, no, I gotcha.
- Okay, alright.

08:14.375 --> 08:15.958

When you're one away

15:15.480 --> 15:16.708
from getting bingo,

15:16.750 --> 15:18.375
- you're gonna let
- everybody know by yelling,

15:18.417 --> 15:19.749
"it's on."

15:19.750 --> 15:21.333
- And our motto
- at legendary bingo is,

15:21.375 --> 15:22.416
"if it ain't on..."

15:22.417 --> 15:24.375
- Strap it on.

15:27.628 --> 15:29.042
- If he says, like, b-5,

15:29.083 --> 15:30.188
you would mark that

15:30.189 --> 15:31.291
on all the sheets.

15:31.292 --> 15:32.417
- I have no idea

15:32.418 --> 15:33.542
what the rules of bingo are,

15:33.583 --> 15:35.457
but I do like these crazy pens

15:35.458 --> 15:36.500
that makes a circle

15:36.501 --> 15:37.542
when you press it down.

16:09.503 --> 16:12.417

16:34.897 --> 16:36.666
- B as in biatch, number 5.

16:36.667 --> 16:37.832
- This game is stressful.

16:37.833 --> 16:39.083
I thought bingo

16:39.084 --> 16:40.332
was for mostly older people,

16:40.333 --> 16:41.666
so it's a slower game.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.166
- Bingo.

16:44.167 --> 16:45.625
- What the f... is happening?

16:45.667 --> 16:48.125
But this bingo is like this.

16:48.167 --> 16:49.207
I-74?

16:49.208 --> 16:51.167
- O -74.

16:56.708 --> 16:58.792
- It's a false bingo.

[All booing]

17:01.708 --> 17:03.125
- A false bingo

17:03.126 --> 17:04.541
means you get spanked.

17:04.542 --> 17:06.500
- No, no, no, no.

17:06.542 --> 17:08.208
- Vida needs
- a good spanking though.

17:08.211 --> 17:09.958

18:30.417 --> 18:31.583
- When you're dating,

18:31.625 --> 18:33.125
- blow jobs are just
- for a blow job.

- when two attractive people

18:41.792 --> 18:44.291
sexual energy all the time.

- I think my grandparents
- had more sex

18:46.167 --> 18:47.625
than me and Jessica do.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.083
I haven't eaten all day.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.458
- You haven't eaten all day,

18:50.500 --> 18:52.292
- your wife's got you
- on a short leash

18:52.333 --> 18:54.458
and you're not having sex

18:54.500 --> 18:56.125
or getting blow jobs.

18:56.167 --> 18:57.417
- Pretty great life, right?

- it's like a kid with a.D.D.

His dool needs

19:04.042 --> 19:05.417
lots of activities

19:05.458 --> 19:07.000
or the dool will get itself

19:07.042 --> 19:08.332
in trouble, like a kid.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.666
- I go out with shervin,

19:09.667 --> 19:10.958
and here's the craziest part.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.333
- When you're not paying
- attention to girls,

19:12.336 --> 19:13.666
they want you even more.

19:13.667 --> 19:15.417
- Hmm.
- It's hard for me.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.625
- Got a wedding ring on,
- you would think

19:16.667 --> 19:18.332
that that's a deterrent.

19:18.333 --> 19:19.625
It's not.

19:19.667 --> 19:20.917
- It's like
- a f... ing magnet, dude.

19:20.958 --> 19:22.499
It's like the forbidden fruit

19:22.500 --> 19:24.999
that everyone wants to taste.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.667
- I'm sitting there like this,
- they're like,

"what's the matter,

- "listen, babe..."
- But why put yourself

19:33.292 --> 19:35.207
in that situation?

19:35.208 --> 19:36.375
It's not a good look

19:36.417 --> 19:38.541
for a married man

19:38.542 --> 19:40.333
to be, you know, going clubbing

19:40.375 --> 19:42.000
with his single friends.

19:42.042 --> 19:43.292
I don't know any wife

19:43.333 --> 19:44.874
that is down with that sh...

19:44.875 --> 19:46.208
- I like fake titties.
- You told me

19:46.211 --> 19:47.333
- you like fake titties.
- Yeah, I like fake titties.

19:47.375 --> 19:49.042
I like fake titties in c-d

19:49.083 --> 19:50.874
and double-d proportions.

19:50.875 --> 19:52.374
- What's gg?

19:52.375 --> 19:53.667
Gg just got 'em done.

19:53.708 --> 19:55.208
- C but she's like a...
- She's just a regular c?

19:55.211 --> 19:57.042
- She's just a regular c,
- not a full c.

19:57.083 --> 19:59.000
- I'm a little worried about gg.

19:59.042 --> 20:01.541
I feel like she's screaming

20:01.542 --> 20:03.541
for help in her own way.

20:03.542 --> 20:04.625
- There's something wrong.

20:04.667 --> 20:05.771
- Yeah, we need to show up

20:05.772 --> 20:06.874
for this bitch.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.042
- So, we're really
- going camping?

20:08.045 --> 20:09.292
- Yeah, we're going camping.

20:09.293 --> 20:10.541
- Ha ha ha ha.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.708
On one hand, this was a person

20:11.750 --> 20:13.374
who tried to hurt me

20:13.375 --> 20:14.875
- and on the other hand,
- this is an old friend

20:14.878 --> 20:16.583
who has a problem.

20:16.625 --> 20:18.042
I'm afraid.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.583
- It really is a hard decision
- for me to go,

20:19.586 --> 20:20.749
but at the end of the day,

20:20.750 --> 20:22.582
as angry as I am with golnesa,

20:22.583 --> 20:24.250
- I think collectively,
- as a group of friends,

20:24.253 --> 20:25.916
we can help her.

20:25.917 --> 20:28.416
- To camping and fixing sh...

20:30.583 --> 20:32.083
- I am.

- Hello, how you doing?

20:50.086 --> 20:51.416
- Doing well, how are you?

20:51.417 --> 20:52.542
- Great.

20:54.417 --> 20:57.167
- A lot of crazy stuff in here.

20:57.208 --> 20:58.457
I'm going camping

20:58.458 --> 21:00.042

27:40.500 --> 27:41.750
between photographer,

27:41.792 --> 27:42.875
model, stylist,

27:42.876 --> 27:43.958
you know, makeup.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.167
- If we don't get
- what I wanna get out of today,

27:46.170 --> 27:48.332
that's 25 grand down the drain.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.833
We got one minute

27:49.834 --> 27:51.332
to have tons of fun, woohoo.

27:51.333 --> 27:52.417
Yes.

27:52.458 --> 27:54.167
- Careful, careful.
- Asi.

27:54.170 --> 27:56.000
- Mom, get out

27:56.001 --> 27:57.833

27:57.875 --> 27:59.792
- Yes. I'm going crazy,

27:59.833 --> 28:00.875
it's blowing my mind.

28:00.917 --> 28:01.980
- Booty, too.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.041
Booty, shake the booties.

28:03.042 --> 28:04.625
- Mom.
- Yes.

28:06.333 --> 28:08.208
- We have one second,
- run, you guys.

28:08.211 --> 28:10.375
Jiggling, jiggle, jiggle.

28:10.417 --> 28:11.459
Shake your Booty

28:11.460 --> 28:12.500
for your husband.

28:12.542 --> 28:14.041
Yay.

28:14.042 --> 28:16.374
Yay, that's a wrap.

28:16.375 --> 28:17.833
- Yeah.
- Mashti,

28:17.875 --> 28:19.541
put your camera down.

28:19.542 --> 28:20.542
I wanna take a portrait

28:20.543 --> 28:21.542
of you and mom right now.

28:21.543 --> 28:23.021
We're gonna take

28:23.022 --> 28:24.500
over this wall, you guys.

28:24.542 --> 28:25.542
Hold each other,

28:25.543 --> 28:27.707
save her, save her.

28:27.708 --> 28:28.874
Mashti, save her,

28:28.875 --> 28:30.374
don't drown her.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.542
It's been 43 years,

28:31.583 --> 28:32.667
do you guys love each other?

28:32.708 --> 28:33.875
- I love him very much.
- Right,

28:33.917 --> 28:36.416
43 years altogether.

28:36.417 --> 28:37.582
- My parents,

28:37.583 --> 28:39.916
when we left Iran,

28:39.917 --> 28:41.249
they took the biggest risk

28:41.250 --> 28:42.334
of anybody's life

28:42.335 --> 28:43.416
anybody can take,

28:43.417 --> 28:45.042
with no certainty of the future.

28:45.083 --> 28:46.667
- Shake your Booty
- for your husband.

28:46.708 --> 28:48.542
- Shake your Booty
- for your husband.

28:48.583 --> 28:49.708
After my parents took

28:49.750 --> 28:51.082
the greatest risk of their life,

28:51.083 --> 28:52.375
they've sort of been like,

28:52.417 --> 28:54.217
- "we risked this,
- we spent this much money,

28:54.250 --> 28:55.250
we got to this place.

28:55.292 --> 28:56.417
- Okay, now we're good,
- we're good.

28:56.420 --> 28:57.583
- Let's just stay here
- for awhile."

28:57.586 --> 28:59.417
- But no, that's like,
- not good enough for me.

28:59.420 --> 29:00.750
This is it.

29:00.792 --> 29:02.250
- And so, it's a little bit
- of like,

29:02.292 --> 29:04.250
- taking my parents' hands
- and like,

29:04.253 --> 29:06.125
having them fly with me.

29:07.750 --> 29:09.417
- Coming up...

29:09.418 --> 29:11.082
- I have a prank gene

29:11.083 --> 29:12.249
deep inside of me,

29:12.250 --> 29:14.249
so I'm gonna f... with people.

29:14.250 --> 29:16.582
- Oh god, oh god.

29:16.583 --> 29:17.604
- Oh, I smell it.

29:17.605 --> 29:18.624
- Oh god.

29:18.625 --> 29:20.000
- Oh, oh.

29:20.001 --> 29:21.375
Get it away from me.

29:41.292 --> 29:43.125
- Jesus.

29:43.167 --> 29:44.667
- Monk status.

29:46.292 --> 29:48.291
My baby.

29:48.292 --> 29:49.791
- How you been?

29:49.792 --> 29:51.957
This crew is not exactly

29:51.958 --> 29:53.021
what you call

29:53.022 --> 29:54.083
"camping material."

29:54.125 --> 29:55.354
- Babe, where are we

29:55.355 --> 29:56.583
putting everything? In there?

29:56.625 --> 29:58.042
- Do you wanna put
- everything in there?

29:58.083 --> 29:59.083
- I'm kind of thinking

29:59.084 --> 30:00.084
out of everyone,

30:00.125 --> 30:01.667
- Asa's gonna have
- the most issues,

30:01.708 --> 30:02.958
only because she kept telling me

30:03.000 --> 30:04.792
she was gonna wear her Kaftans.

30:04.833 --> 30:05.999
It's the woods, it's like,

30:06.000 --> 30:07.250
there's bugs, there's lizards,

30:07.292 --> 30:09.083
- there's all kinds
- of I don't know what.

30:09.125 --> 30:10.500
- This is my area.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.333
- Everything can go up
- in the kaftan,

30:12.336 --> 30:14.167
you just wanna keep it out,

30:14.208 --> 30:15.333
seal it.

30:15.375 --> 30:16.666
Protect the vagina.

30:16.667 --> 30:17.917
Where is everyone?

30:17.958 --> 30:19.104
- Oh, I see someone.

30:19.105 --> 30:20.250
There's rez.

30:20.292 --> 30:21.333
- What up?
- What's up?

30:21.336 --> 30:22.917
- Indiana Jones.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.625
- Rez.
- Oh, lord.

30:27.667 --> 30:29.146
This f... ing thing

30:29.147 --> 30:30.625
is from 1908.

30:32.708 --> 30:34.458
You guys, there's old hair

30:34.500 --> 30:36.167
- and someone left their...
- Ew.

30:36.170 --> 30:37.480
- Rubber band

30:37.481 --> 30:38.792
from I don't know when.

30:38.833 --> 30:40.000
- No way.

30:40.042 --> 30:41.458
- It is the oldest,

30:41.500 --> 30:42.541
ugliest,

30:42.542 --> 30:44.292
stankiest rv

30:44.333 --> 30:45.374
I've ever seen

30:45.375 --> 30:46.874
in my whole f... ing life.

30:46.875 --> 30:48.708
- I thought we were gonna get
- motley crue's

30:48.711 --> 30:50.374
f... ing tour bus

30:50.375 --> 30:51.375
or some sh...

30:51.417 --> 30:52.667
I didn't know we were gonna get

30:52.708 --> 30:54.875
the griswold's f... ing family rv

30:54.917 --> 30:56.958
from 1979.

31:02.833 --> 31:04.708
- I hated
- this camping trip idea.

31:04.750 --> 31:05.833
Never been camping before,

31:05.875 --> 31:07.374
I brought a gigantic suitcase

31:07.375 --> 31:08.375
because I didn't know

31:08.376 --> 31:09.376
what the f... we need.

31:09.417 --> 31:12.374
Shorts, t-shirts, sweaters,

31:12.375 --> 31:14.042
- clothes to go out in,
- in case we're going to dinner.

31:14.045 --> 31:15.333
- I don't know about you
- white people, man.

31:15.375 --> 31:16.375
What the f...?

31:16.376 --> 31:18.875
Why would anyone go camping?

31:18.917 --> 31:20.208
- What up?
- Hey, hey, hey.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.292
- We're trying to get

31:21.293 --> 31:22.374
the oven to work.

31:22.375 --> 31:23.583
- Oven?

31:25.375 --> 31:26.625
- That would be amazing,

31:26.626 --> 31:27.875
thank you.

31:27.917 --> 31:29.250
- What's up, merce?

31:29.251 --> 31:30.583
- This is what we're taking?

31:30.625 --> 31:31.916
- Merce, did you forget

31:31.917 --> 31:33.833
- like, the other two-thirds
- of your luggage?

31:33.875 --> 31:36.082
- No, that's plenty.

31:36.083 --> 31:37.917
- This is gonna be interesting.

31:39.708 --> 31:42.083
- Hi. Hey, golnesa.

31:45.250 --> 31:46.833
- Would I go camping

31:46.875 --> 31:48.082
if it were up to me?

31:48.083 --> 31:49.167
Never.

31:49.208 --> 31:50.917
But when you have a friend

31:50.958 --> 31:52.916
who is on the verge,

31:52.917 --> 31:54.250
she's beyond the verge,

31:54.292 --> 31:57.167
we are at critical mass, bitch.

31:57.208 --> 31:58.500
- We're gonna stop here.

31:58.542 --> 31:59.833
- Wait, you're not driving,
- are you?

31:59.875 --> 32:01.021
- I am.

32:01.022 --> 32:02.167
- What?

32:02.208 --> 32:03.249
- Right.

32:03.250 --> 32:04.917
- Golnesa can barely walk
- across the street

32:05.000 --> 32:06.750
- and she's driving
- this big-ass tin can

32:06.792 --> 32:07.792
with all of us in it.

32:07.793 --> 32:08.958
And when golnesa

32:09.000 --> 32:11.083
has her mind set to something,

32:11.125 --> 32:13.124
that's what's gonna happen.

32:13.125 --> 32:14.750
- Is everyone on?
- Let's drive.

32:14.792 --> 32:16.458
- Hey, you guys wanna do
- like, a group prayer?

32:16.461 --> 32:18.458
- I did pray. I've been praying
- this whole time,

32:18.461 --> 32:20.042
thinking about this situation.

32:20.083 --> 32:21.208
- Can you just direct me

32:21.250 --> 32:22.792
- until I get to the highway?
- Yeah,

32:22.795 --> 32:24.375
- I'll direct you
- until you get to the highway.

32:24.417 --> 32:26.125
- It's like gilligan
- and the skipper.

32:26.167 --> 32:27.917
- I wanna turn the lights on.

32:30.792 --> 32:32.208
Thank you.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.624
- Oh my goodness.

32:33.625 --> 32:34.958
Who the f... elected this?

32:36.292 --> 32:37.875
- Are we ready?

32:37.917 --> 32:40.125
- You guys both looked away.

32:40.167 --> 32:41.291
We're going, we're rolling.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.334
- We're rolling.

32:42.335 --> 32:43.375
- Oh my goodness.

32:43.417 --> 32:44.584
- What's the top speed

32:44.585 --> 32:45.750
on this thing?

32:45.792 --> 32:47.125
- 100.

32:47.126 --> 32:48.458
- Okay, so let's stay at 50.

32:51.333 --> 32:52.646
- Oh.

32:52.647 --> 32:53.958
- Oh, mortadella juice,

32:54.000 --> 32:55.000
mortadella juice.

32:55.001 --> 32:56.166
- Oh no.

32:56.167 --> 32:57.250
- Secure everything,

32:57.292 --> 32:58.750
- we're about to go hit
- some bumps.

32:58.792 --> 33:00.083
- Huh?
- Babe!

33:00.125 --> 33:01.333
- -Oh, f... that.
- Go slow, man!

33:01.336 --> 33:02.667
- Go right over it.
- Yeah.

33:02.708 --> 33:03.792
- What the f... was that?
- It was a speed bump.

33:03.833 --> 33:05.000
- Slow down on them, babe.

33:05.042 --> 33:06.417
- I'm going 15.

33:06.458 --> 33:07.854
- Can we stop

33:07.855 --> 33:09.250
for one second or something?

33:09.292 --> 33:10.332
The beers, the beers.

33:10.333 --> 33:11.832
Guys, slow down.

33:11.833 --> 33:12.958
- Hold on, hold on.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.332
- Every turn and every brake,

33:14.333 --> 33:15.958
- we're falling over
- to the point of like,

33:16.000 --> 33:17.083
we might get really hurt.

33:17.125 --> 33:18.292
- [Speaking farsi]

33:18.333 --> 33:19.832
- We're super vip,

33:19.833 --> 33:20.917
very important persians,

33:20.958 --> 33:22.332
precious cargo.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.000
- Golnesa.
- Golnesa, dude.

33:24.003 --> 33:25.166
- I drive a truck,

33:25.167 --> 33:26.480
so I kind of have

33:26.481 --> 33:27.792
a concept of big cars

33:27.833 --> 33:29.542
- and these people
- have little tiny cars

33:29.545 --> 33:30.688
that they hardly fit in

33:30.689 --> 33:31.833
themselves.

33:35.208 --> 33:37.833
- I have a prank gene

33:37.875 --> 33:39.167
deep inside of me.

33:39.208 --> 33:40.521
So, how am I gonna pass

33:40.522 --> 33:41.833
the time?

33:41.875 --> 33:43.207
I'm gonna f... with people.

33:43.208 --> 33:45.041
I have liquid sharts

33:45.042 --> 33:46.500
and liquid ass.

33:46.542 --> 33:49.500
So, why not start the pranks?

33:56.667 --> 33:57.855
It's all good, clean,

33:57.856 --> 33:59.042
persian fun.

33:59.083 --> 34:01.042
- A little liquid ass
- and liquid sharts

34:01.045 --> 34:03.292
never killed anybody, okay?

34:07.208 --> 34:08.541
- You guys, I give up.

34:08.542 --> 34:11.208
- F... ing motherf... er.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.582
- Who went to the bathroom last?

34:13.583 --> 34:14.625
Who was in there?

34:14.626 --> 34:15.667
- Someone took a sh...?

34:15.708 --> 34:17.082
- Reza pooped all over.

34:17.083 --> 34:18.083
- Reza pooped.

34:18.084 --> 34:19.083
- I did not take a sh...

34:19.084 --> 34:20.375
- It's okay if you have to,

34:20.417 --> 34:21.750
- just press the button
- afterwards.

34:21.753 --> 34:23.583
- Babe, I did not take a sh...
- No, go look,

34:23.586 --> 34:25.083
- it's all over,
- it's around the seat,

34:25.086 --> 34:26.500
- it's on the floor.
- Come look.

34:26.542 --> 34:27.708
- But who pooped?

34:27.750 --> 34:29.167
- Reza.
- I did not poop.

34:29.208 --> 34:30.667
- Oh, man.

34:31.750 --> 34:33.250
- That's disgusting.

34:35.250 --> 34:36.916
- Oh god, oh god.

34:36.917 --> 34:39.000
- Oh, man, it smells so bad.

34:39.042 --> 34:40.583
- Oh my god.
- Oh, oh, I smell it.

34:40.586 --> 34:42.583
- Oh god.
- Oh, oh.

34:42.625 --> 34:43.917
- Oh god.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.082
- Oh my god,

34:47.083 --> 34:48.917
ahh.

34:48.958 --> 34:50.792
Get it away from me.

34:52.125 --> 34:53.958
- Whoa, whoa,
- watch the f... ing road.

34:53.961 --> 34:55.875
- Ahh.

34:55.917 --> 34:56.958
- Coming up...
- That bitch

34:56.961 --> 34:58.625
- is in her natural habitat
- right now.

34:58.628 --> 34:59.750
- Yeah. I need a buffer.

34:59.792 --> 35:01.472
- You guys have to be
- between me and her.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.375
- I want my tent as far away

35:03.417 --> 35:05.333
from golnesa as possible.

35:11.792 --> 35:13.792
- What the f... you guys?

35:13.833 --> 35:15.208
- Alright, we need
- to exit or something.

35:15.250 --> 35:16.457
- I need to get off.

35:16.458 --> 35:17.688
Why does it smell

35:17.689 --> 35:18.917
like dog sh... though?

35:20.958 --> 35:22.291
- Whoa, whoa,

35:22.292 --> 35:23.875
- watch the f... ing road.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:23.917 --> 35:25.375
- What happened, what happened?

35:25.417 --> 35:26.958
- F... ing looking this way,
- driving.

35:26.961 --> 35:28.542
- Things are flying
- in my f... ing face

35:28.583 --> 35:30.208
because I can't close the window

35:30.250 --> 35:31.957
because it smells so ratchet.

35:31.958 --> 35:33.250
- Just pull over here.

35:33.292 --> 35:35.271
Stop right here, park it.

35:35.272 --> 35:37.250
- F... f...

35:37.292 --> 35:38.313
- F...

35:38.314 --> 35:39.332
- Oh.

35:39.333 --> 35:40.333
- [Retching]

35:46.292 --> 35:48.500
- I cleaned it, are you happy?

35:48.542 --> 35:49.625
- Is it Marty's,

35:49.667 --> 35:51.125
did you bring Marty's dog sh...?

35:51.167 --> 35:52.499
I swear to god

35:52.500 --> 35:53.500
- I will punch you.
- Babe, what the f...

35:53.542 --> 35:54.958
- Are you doing?
- I will punch you

35:55.000 --> 35:56.625
- if you get that sh... near me.
- With which hand?

35:56.667 --> 35:59.332
- Get it away from me, Reza.

35:59.333 --> 36:00.625
- Let's get going.

36:00.667 --> 36:02.292
- It's gotten worse, babe.

36:06.167 --> 36:07.832
- Still smells.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.999
It still smells like sh...

36:10.000 --> 36:11.999
- Mj, just sit in the front.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.667
- Get in, let's go.
- Rez, it smells really,

36:13.708 --> 36:15.792
really strong.

36:15.833 --> 36:17.541
- Merce, we're leaving.

36:17.542 --> 36:18.938
- Security, security men.

36:18.939 --> 36:20.333
Go, go.

36:20.375 --> 36:22.458
- Mercedes [Speaking farsi]

36:22.500 --> 36:23.542
- Merce, get in...
- [Speaking farsi]

36:23.545 --> 36:24.875
- Get in.
- [Speaking farsi]

36:24.878 --> 36:26.500
- Get in.
- [Speaking farsi]

36:27.750 --> 36:29.209
- We don't look

36:29.210 --> 36:30.667
like Johnny appleseed

36:30.708 --> 36:31.833
and we're in front

36:31.834 --> 36:32.958
of a government building

36:33.000 --> 36:35.707
in a very large vehicle.

36:35.708 --> 36:37.167
Merce, get in, get in.

36:37.208 --> 36:38.333
Close the door.

36:38.375 --> 36:40.208
- That could potentially
- be housing

36:40.250 --> 36:41.541
lots of c-4,

36:41.542 --> 36:42.707
I don't know.

36:42.708 --> 36:44.833
And we are all running

36:44.875 --> 36:46.292
from this vehicle,

36:46.333 --> 36:47.958
trying to get away from it.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.375
So, I'm thinking

36:49.417 --> 36:50.875
this is not a good look.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.667
- He screeched those brakes
- in that golf cart,

36:52.708 --> 36:54.333
- did you hear that?
- Yeah.

36:55.667 --> 36:56.875
- He's never gotten
- to do that before,

36:56.878 --> 36:58.042
he had to do it.

36:58.083 --> 36:59.250
He's really cool.

37:04.750 --> 37:05.792
- Oh god.

37:06.917 --> 37:08.708
- I'm gonna ride shotgun
- with golnesa.

37:08.750 --> 37:10.250
- If that's the best spot
- in the house,

37:10.292 --> 37:11.708
I'll take it.

37:15.375 --> 37:17.416
- I'm really in a really, like,

37:17.417 --> 37:19.208
- uncomfortable place
- with what's going on

37:19.250 --> 37:20.708
between mj and I.

37:23.042 --> 37:25.042
But at the end of the day,

37:25.083 --> 37:26.083
when you love someone,

37:26.084 --> 37:27.083
you don't want

37:27.084 --> 37:28.396
liquid ass going up

37:28.397 --> 37:29.708
their nostrils.

37:30.750 --> 37:32.042
- Should we put
- some of the food away

37:32.083 --> 37:33.375
and play hokm right here?

37:33.417 --> 37:34.500
- I don't know how to play.

37:34.501 --> 37:35.582
- We'll teach you.

37:35.583 --> 37:36.667
Let me tell you guys

37:36.668 --> 37:37.749
what's gonna be going on

37:37.750 --> 37:39.042
on this round.

37:39.083 --> 37:40.708
Guess what?

37:40.750 --> 37:42.104
Still, diamonds

37:42.105 --> 37:43.458
are the girl's best friend.

37:45.458 --> 37:47.708
Was it 2-0?

37:47.750 --> 37:48.957
Oh yeah, baby,

37:48.958 --> 37:50.458
oh yeah, oh yeah.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.583
- [Speaking farsi]

37:52.625 --> 37:53.957
- [Speaking farsi]

37:53.958 --> 37:55.375
- It was so great
- to be surrounded

37:55.417 --> 37:57.042
by just cool people

37:57.083 --> 37:58.957
who wanna have a fun time

37:58.958 --> 38:00.792
- and just kind
- of let me decompress

38:00.795 --> 38:01.959
and stop f... ing being

38:01.960 --> 38:03.124
in my own head

38:03.125 --> 38:05.083
about what's going on at home.

38:05.125 --> 38:08.791
- Nah nah nah na na.

38:08.792 --> 38:10.708
- We're pouring some patron.
- Salamati.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.708
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.458
- Golnesa, thank you
- for driving, by the way.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.646
- For driving.

38:15.647 --> 38:16.791
- Are you guys drunk?

38:16.792 --> 38:17.958
- Not yet.

38:21.167 --> 38:23.292
- Are you okay?

38:23.333 --> 38:24.458
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

38:28.167 --> 38:30.250
- Is she really okay?

38:30.292 --> 38:31.646
- You guys, we're here.

38:31.647 --> 38:32.999
- You guys, we're here.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.250
- Yay.

38:35.292 --> 38:37.063
- La la la lah, you guys.

38:37.064 --> 38:38.832
- Listen to the earth.

38:38.833 --> 38:40.625
- Wow, you guys,
- there's nobody else around us.

38:40.667 --> 38:42.042
- Thank god.

38:42.043 --> 38:43.417
- The persians made it.

38:43.458 --> 38:45.417
- Woohoo.

38:45.458 --> 38:46.625
- Yeah.

38:46.626 --> 38:47.792
- Good job.

38:47.833 --> 38:49.167
- Oh god.
- Good job.

38:49.170 --> 38:50.999
- Oh my god.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.417
- It's amazing here.

38:52.418 --> 38:53.833
- The air.

38:53.875 --> 38:56.125
- I don't know what part
- of the ground to kiss right now.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.917
I can't believe we made it.

38:57.958 --> 38:59.125
- [With accent] Are we here?

38:59.167 --> 39:00.833
- Yeah, [Speaking farsi]

39:00.875 --> 39:03.167
- Oh sh... man.

39:03.208 --> 39:04.333
- Okay, so let's do

39:04.334 --> 39:05.458
the tents first.

39:05.500 --> 39:06.874
And who's in what tent?

39:06.875 --> 39:08.208
Mike and gg are obviously

39:08.250 --> 39:10.083
not in the same tent.

39:14.250 --> 39:15.438
Golnesa has a system,

39:15.439 --> 39:16.625
babe, look at her.

39:16.667 --> 39:18.458
- I'm just gonna copy golnesa.
- Dude, that bitch

39:18.500 --> 39:20.042
- is in her natural habitat
- right now.

39:20.083 --> 39:22.042
- Yeah.

39:22.043 --> 39:24.000
- [Speaking farsi]

39:24.042 --> 39:25.833
- Mike, you keep
- creeping closer to us.

39:25.875 --> 39:27.835
- Yeah, because I'm trying to
- get away from her.

39:31.833 --> 39:33.167
Do you really need me

39:33.168 --> 39:34.500
to f... ing explain to you

39:34.542 --> 39:37.000
why I want my tent as far away

39:37.042 --> 39:38.458
from golnesa as possible?

39:38.500 --> 39:40.542
I mean, really, really?

39:40.583 --> 39:42.041
Are you really asking me that?

39:42.042 --> 39:43.207
- You know what, this time,

39:43.208 --> 39:44.625
she's gonna creep

39:44.626 --> 39:46.042
to your room, fool.

39:46.083 --> 39:50.749
- Ha ha ha ha ha.

39:50.750 --> 39:52.875
- We're crowning, are crowning,
- we're crowning.

39:52.917 --> 39:54.416
- Yay,

39:54.417 --> 39:56.916
lovely, lovely.

39:56.917 --> 39:58.083
- I just wanna point out

39:58.125 --> 39:59.582
that the gay dude smoked

39:59.583 --> 40:01.917
the two straight dudes are like,

40:01.958 --> 40:03.250
still trying

40:03.251 --> 40:04.542
to figure their sh... out.

40:05.917 --> 40:07.542
- Good job, ladies.
- Let me ask a...

40:07.583 --> 40:08.583
A very stupid question.

40:08.584 --> 40:09.583
- Huh?

40:09.584 --> 40:11.500
- Yeah?
- Sherv has his own tent,

40:11.542 --> 40:13.083
Mike has his own tent,

40:13.125 --> 40:15.082
golnesa has the biggest tent.

40:15.083 --> 40:16.917
Yet me, Asa, and mj are sleeping

40:16.958 --> 40:18.042
in that tent?

40:19.083 --> 40:20.375
- You guys are the smartest

40:20.417 --> 40:21.667
- because you guys are gonna have
- each other's body heat

40:21.708 --> 40:22.875
- to keep you warm.
- No,

40:22.917 --> 40:23.917
you're gonna be jacking off,

40:23.958 --> 40:26.124
generating heat.

40:26.125 --> 40:27.792
- Why you always fantasizing
- about my dool

40:27.833 --> 40:29.125
- and what I'm doing with it?
- F... you and your dool.

40:29.128 --> 40:30.917
- It's really weird, dude.

40:30.958 --> 40:32.458
- Your dool has gotten us

40:32.500 --> 40:33.958
nothing but trouble.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.583
I need to cut that thing off.

40:37.958 --> 40:39.208
- [Knife being unsheathed]
- Oh sh...

40:39.250 --> 40:40.854
- Coming up...

40:40.855 --> 40:42.457
- Woo, it's our first fire.

40:42.458 --> 40:43.917
- Maybe this camping trip

40:43.958 --> 40:45.917
- won't just fix golnesa,
- but fix us all.

40:45.958 --> 40:47.542
- Thank you
- for bringing us here, monkey.

40:47.583 --> 40:49.292
- Yeah.

40:49.293 --> 40:51.000
- Thanks for coming.

40:55.792 --> 40:57.542
- You guys, I think
- the mattresses

40:57.583 --> 40:58.625
don't require a pump.

40:58.667 --> 40:59.791
We just have to twist it

40:59.792 --> 41:01.457
and it inflates.

41:01.458 --> 41:02.625
- Well, before you...
- Let's light it

41:02.667 --> 41:03.875
when everyone's here.

41:03.917 --> 41:05.750
- I really think
- when you're in a campground

41:05.792 --> 41:06.999
with people that you love

41:07.000 --> 41:08.250
and you make a fire,

41:08.292 --> 41:09.667
something starts happening.

41:09.708 --> 41:10.792
- Guys, come here for a second,

41:10.833 --> 41:12.499
let's gather round for a second.

41:12.500 --> 41:13.750
Golnesa.

41:13.751 --> 41:15.000
- Come here,

41:15.042 --> 41:16.167
- we're waiting for you.
- Okay, I'm coming.

41:16.170 --> 41:17.917
Ow, okay.

41:17.958 --> 41:19.125
The fact

41:19.126 --> 41:20.292
that we're all here together

41:20.333 --> 41:22.083
and everyone seems like

41:22.125 --> 41:23.833
- they're having
- a good time setting up,

41:23.836 --> 41:25.583
it's just like,

41:25.625 --> 41:27.000
all coming into place for me

41:27.042 --> 41:28.792
- and this is exactly
- what I wanted.

41:28.833 --> 41:30.250
- Thank you
- for bringing us here, monkey.

41:30.292 --> 41:31.458
- Yeah.
- Thanks for coming.

41:31.500 --> 41:32.500
- I hope...
- What a great idea, right?

41:32.503 --> 41:33.750
- I wanted to just...

41:33.792 --> 41:35.333
- I really hope that we get
- what we came

41:35.336 --> 41:37.167
- to get out
- of this vacation together,

41:37.208 --> 41:38.417
bring us back together

41:38.458 --> 41:39.958
as a group.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.292
I've missed you guys

41:41.333 --> 41:42.500
and I love you

41:42.542 --> 41:43.833
- and we just celebrated
- rosh hashanah,

41:43.836 --> 41:45.167
- which is the new year,
- the Jewish new year.

41:45.208 --> 41:46.250
And I hope

41:46.251 --> 41:47.292
that it's a healthy,

41:47.333 --> 41:48.438
happy, prosperous new year

41:48.439 --> 41:49.542
for all of us

41:49.583 --> 41:51.125
and we all have growth

41:51.167 --> 41:52.625
and we all learn

41:52.667 --> 41:54.000
to love each other and be one

41:54.042 --> 41:55.792
- and, you know,
- back each other up

41:55.833 --> 41:57.375
- and help each other
- when we're down

41:57.378 --> 41:58.458
and be guiding lights

41:58.500 --> 41:59.792
for one another.

41:59.833 --> 42:01.333
- Me too.
- I love you guys.

42:01.375 --> 42:02.792
- Let's connect.

42:02.833 --> 42:04.458
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

42:04.500 --> 42:06.167
- Up in flames she goes.

42:06.208 --> 42:07.500
- This is like,

42:07.501 --> 42:08.792
a mini burning man right here.

42:08.833 --> 42:10.000
- Woo,

42:10.042 --> 42:12.292
it's our first fire.

42:14.333 --> 42:15.541
- I tell you,

42:15.542 --> 42:16.667
there's no fire

42:16.708 --> 42:18.041
without air, right?

42:18.042 --> 42:19.042
- Without oxygen.
- We're doing good,

42:19.083 --> 42:20.874
plenty in there.

42:20.875 --> 42:22.874
- Who told you that?

42:22.875 --> 42:24.374
- Science.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.375
You know,

42:25.376 --> 42:26.375
maybe this camping trip

42:26.376 --> 42:27.688
won't just fix golnesa,

42:27.689 --> 42:29.000
but fix us all.

42:32.583 --> 42:33.625
- Yay.
