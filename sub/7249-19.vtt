00:02.711 --> 00:05.005
I hate crossword puzzles.
They make me feel stupid.

00:05.088 --> 00:07.841
- Then don't do them.
- If you don't, you're not only stupid...

00:07.925 --> 00:08.926
you're also a coward.

00:09.009 --> 00:12.012
- Or you have better things to do.
- You think people will buy that?

00:12.095 --> 00:15.807
The people who line up on a daily basis
and ask if you do crossword puzzles...

00:15.891 --> 00:18.060
and then when you say no,
challenge you as to why?

00:18.143 --> 00:20.687
- Yes, I think they will buy it.
- Look, new bagboy.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.649
That's Marty. He's subbing for Dean
while he's out of town.

00:23.732 --> 00:27.110
Marty does the jar twirl
before putting the salsa in the bag.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.738
- Impressive. Very Cocktail.
- Marty's a nice guy.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.448
- Marty's an ambitious snake in the grass.
- What?

00:32.533 --> 00:34.201
The jar twirl. The double-bagging.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.912
The 'Have a nice day, ma'am,'
after every customer.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.539
That guy's got an agenda.

00:38.622 --> 00:40.749
- Which is?
- He's out to take Dean's job.

00:40.832 --> 00:43.293
- I don't think so.
- Yes, he is.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.254
I'm telling you. He wants that position.

00:45.337 --> 00:48.799
Dean better hurry from his grandmother's
or he can kiss his job goodbye.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.051
- They're not going to fire Dean.
- Why not?

00:51.134 --> 00:54.221
For starters,
someone stole Taylor's ladder last week...

00:54.304 --> 00:56.890
and Dean is the only one
who can reach the top shelves.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.851
- Interesting.
- What?

00:59.393 --> 01:04.063
Just as Marty, a. k.a. Eve Harrington,
shows up trying to take Dean's job...

01:04.147 --> 01:07.860
Taylor's ladder mysteriously disappears
suddenly making Dean invaluable...

01:07.901 --> 01:11.488
no matter what fancy tricks
Lon Chaney Jr. Over there pulls.

01:11.572 --> 01:15.284
Good thinking, Dean.
Smart thinking, my friend.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.661
You need to start napping
in the afternoons.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.162
Taylor, pulling double duty today?

01:19.246 --> 01:21.790
I like to fill in behind the register
every now and then.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.834
Keeps me in contact with the clientele.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.129
Also, it allows me to keep an eye
on the 'Take a Penny' pot here...

01:27.212 --> 01:30.632
make sure people aren't pocketing
the pennies for their personal gain...

01:30.716 --> 01:33.552
but are legitimately using them
to make exact change.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.387
Cool. Mom, look.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.681
Yeah, it's
'Movie in the Square' night again.

01:37.764 --> 01:38.974
- Great.
- We'll be there.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.643
- Excellent. There you are.
- What's the movie this year?

01:41.727 --> 01:44.062
- Something really great.
- Really? What?

01:44.104 --> 01:45.647
- A real winner.
- What's it called?

01:45.731 --> 01:48.817
- Show up and be surprised.
- What don't you tell me what it is?

01:48.901 --> 01:50.569
- No.
- Why not?

01:50.611 --> 01:53.280
- Because.
- Because why? What is the...

01:55.407 --> 01:58.869
- There is a line behind you.
- You chose The Yearling again?

01:58.952 --> 02:03.582
It is a fine, wholesome motion picture.
Moving story. Lovely scenes of nature.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.210
You've shown The Yearling
the last three years in a row.

02:06.293 --> 02:10.255
I'm getting a little tired of hearing you
complain about this every single year.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.090
I'm tired, too. Pick another movie.

02:12.174 --> 02:16.053
A lot of hard work and careful planning
go into those nights. You never help plan.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.097
You never volunteer.
You have never once been a ticket ripper...

02:19.139 --> 02:21.642
as long as I have been involved
in that function.

02:21.725 --> 02:25.604
Personally, missy, if you can't participate
with a smile and a hug...

02:25.646 --> 02:28.941
- then you shouldn't participate at all.
- I shouldn't, but I am.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.943
- Pick another movie.
- No.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.861
There's millions of great movies out there.

02:32.945 --> 02:35.989
Any one would be better
than The Yearling for the fourth time.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.783
Fine! You do it!

02:37.824 --> 02:39.493
- What?
- You pick the movie!

02:39.576 --> 02:41.078
- Seriously?
- I've had it.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.330
You have such strong opinions
about everything...

02:43.413 --> 02:47.042
you go out and try to find a movie
that everybody will enjoy.

02:47.125 --> 02:51.463
It's all yours. I relinquish
my movie-picking crown to you!

02:53.632 --> 02:55.425
- He relinquished his crown!
- I heard.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.719
- I got his crown!
- And it looks great on you.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.179
Cool! This is gonna be fun.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.974
Let's go home and make popcorn
and pick which movie we want.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.392
- I get to help?
- Of course.

03:03.475 --> 03:06.728
- And can I borrow the crown?
- I don't know, honey. We'll have to see.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:02.701 --> 04:04.036
- Wizard of Oz.
- The Sting.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.871
- Rocky.
- Crimes and Misdemeanors.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.915
- The Singing Detective.
- That's a miniseries.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.541
- So?
- It's like six hours long.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.127
- Good point. I got it. Arthur.
- Yes.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.588
- Or Sophie's Choice.
- Very similar.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.757
I can't choose.
There's too many great movies.

04:16.839 --> 04:17.925
The burden is overwhelming.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.928
I'm sinking under the pressure.
My grasp on reality is slipping.

04:21.011 --> 04:24.223
I can't do it, I just can't...
How about Cabin Boy?

04:24.306 --> 04:25.265
- Will you get that?
- No.

04:25.349 --> 04:26.350
- Why not?
- Time?

04:26.433 --> 04:27.601
- 6:45.
- On?

04:27.684 --> 04:29.061
Wednesday.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.483
- Dad, hi.
- Kiddo, what's going on?

04:34.566 --> 04:37.861
Not much. Just getting ready for school
and trying to think up movies.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.614
- Movies for what?
- Our town does this big movie festival...

04:40.697 --> 04:42.783
and this year Mom gets to pick the movie.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.244
- How'd she get that gig?
- She ticked off the guy...

04:45.285 --> 04:48.038
- that usually does it and he quit.
- Sounds about right.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.748
How are things? How's Sherrie?

04:49.832 --> 04:53.168
Nothing much is going on here.
Same old, same old.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.255
Listen, I've got to cut this talk short...

04:56.338 --> 04:58.882
but I sent you an e-mail, so read it.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.885
And add 40 minutes onto my tab
for next week's call.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.178
- Deal?
- Deal.

05:03.262 --> 05:07.099
- You want to talk to Mom before you go?
- No, I can't.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.685
I really need to run. You say hello for me.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.937
- Okay.
- I'll talk to you Wednesday.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.981
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Dad.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.066
- He says hello.
- He does not.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.819
Are you going to tell me
what you two are fighting about?

05:18.902 --> 05:19.903
We're not fighting.

05:19.987 --> 05:23.824
What you're not fighting about
that keeps you from talking to each other?

05:23.907 --> 05:26.910
- How about Desperately Seeking Susan?
- How about My Mother is Two?

05:26.994 --> 05:29.288
- Never saw it. Angie Dickinson?
- You're impossible.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.999
Right. You're Impossible
was the one with Angie Dickinson.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.710
Fine. Forget it. I give.
Stay in a fight. I don't care.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.795
I'm late for school. We'll finish this later.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.714
- After school, Luke's?
- I'll be there.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.340
- Bye, hon.
- Bye.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.480
Fifteen minutes left.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.498
Lane.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.877
- I need a pencil.
- I don't have one.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.546
- Then I need a pen.
- You only have 15 minutes left.

06:19.630 --> 06:22.132
- Then I need the answers.
- There's a pen in my bag.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.301
- I can't go through your bag.
- Yes, you can.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.845
My mother told me
never to go through a lady's bag...

06:26.887 --> 06:29.681
at least not until
you're a couple blocks away.

06:29.723 --> 06:33.644
Just kidding. She never said that. Though
it sounds like good advice, doesn't it?

06:33.727 --> 06:36.188
- Take it and shut up.
- Boy, I tell you, it's true...

06:36.230 --> 06:38.398
small towns sure are friendly.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.579
Come in.

06:53.789 --> 06:58.126
I got a call you wanted to see me.
I'm Luke Danes, Jess Mariano's uncle.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.921
Jess Mariano? Yes...

07:01.964 --> 07:03.590
- Come in.
- Thanks.

07:04.550 --> 07:08.345
Is everything okay? I didn't see
any cop cars or fire trucks out front so...

07:08.428 --> 07:11.139
- Mr. Danes, please, have a seat.
- A seat.

07:11.223 --> 07:13.767
So this is a seat thing.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.566
- What's he done?
- Why do you think he's done something?

07:20.607 --> 07:23.944
You're staring at a folder
that's looking a little thick there...

07:24.027 --> 07:26.613
I get a call to come over and talk to you.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.699
So why don't you just tell me
what he's done?

07:28.782 --> 07:29.783
Nothing.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.911
- Nothing?
- No homework, no class participation.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.788
His attendance record is erratic at best.

07:34.872 --> 07:37.833
His attitude to his teachers
ranges from indifferent to hostile.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.377
He shows no interest in activities
or other students...

07:40.460 --> 07:42.880
and there is the issue
of the disappearing baseballs.

07:42.921 --> 07:44.590
- The what?
- Every baseball on campus...

07:44.673 --> 07:48.594
- seems to have disappeared.
- You don't think Jess seriously...

07:49.178 --> 07:52.264
- I'll check when I get home.
- I appreciate that.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.768
I don't suspect we'll solve
every problem in one meeting...

07:56.852 --> 07:59.771
so let's focus on the most important one:

07:59.813 --> 08:01.231
His grades.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.733
- Not good?
- Not good.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.445
- I'll have a talk with him about that.
- You have to do more than talk.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.238
- You have to help him.
- Me?

08:08.780 --> 08:11.241
No, I'm not the one you want helping him.

08:11.325 --> 08:14.411
I went to this school.
I'm sure there's a note stuffed in there...

08:14.494 --> 08:17.623
about me with the words 'Trade SchooI'
stamped in big letters.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.459
If you can't help,
you have to find someone who can.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.294
- Like who?
- A relative.

08:22.336 --> 08:25.631
I don't think so.
Believe me, I'm the Einstein of the clan.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.257
Maybe you need to hire a tutor.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.634
A tutor?

08:30.177 --> 08:33.054
Jess is flunking out.
He's not going to make it.

08:33.138 --> 08:37.308
If something is not done about that
right now, he's going to repeat this year.

08:37.351 --> 08:41.438
- I'm sorry, but that's where we are.
- Okay, if that's where we are...

08:41.522 --> 08:44.858
- then I'll just have to figure something out.
- Good.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.363
- Let's not forget about those baseballs.
- Right.

08:49.446 --> 08:52.449
Been using tennis balls
for a couple of weeks.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.285
- Very different results.
- I'm sure it is.

08:58.163 --> 09:01.834
If we take off Fletch and Urban Cowboy...

09:02.501 --> 09:05.462
we still have 75 possibilities.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.173
- How are we gonna pick just one?
- I don't know.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.175
Maybe we should do
a movie marathon weekend.

09:10.259 --> 09:12.427
Show one movie
after the other for three days...

09:12.511 --> 09:14.805
charge a fortune,
gouge them on bottled water...

09:14.888 --> 09:18.851
have really disgusting bathrooms.
It'll be like our own Woodstock.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.186
Good. There you are.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.730
- I have something for you.
- What?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.941
- This.
- Jeez.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.569
When you get through this
and make your decision...

09:28.652 --> 09:31.572
the number of the man you need
to contact is on the first page.

09:31.655 --> 09:32.739
What man? What is this?

09:32.823 --> 09:36.618
The list of titles that are available
for you to pick from for the movie night.

09:36.702 --> 09:37.995
The list of titles?

09:38.036 --> 09:41.331
- I'm sorry, can't we pick our own movie?
- You're not serious?

09:41.415 --> 09:43.792
Not often, but just there,
I had some serious going.

09:43.876 --> 09:46.003
My dear girl, movies are expensive...

09:46.044 --> 09:49.089
and we get fabulous deals
with this particular place.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.675
They have a wide selection
and they're very friendly...

09:51.758 --> 09:53.385
and since it all goes to charity...

09:53.468 --> 09:56.722
they agree to give us anything
on that list for free.

09:56.763 --> 10:00.475
- So we have to pick a movie off this list?
- It's fun.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.978
They put the movie title over here...

10:03.061 --> 10:05.397
and a brief description
of the storyline over here.

10:05.439 --> 10:09.359
And believe me, there are
some excellent movies on that list. Really.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.278
- Top notch.
- Arctic Flight.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.197
'Man with plane flies charter to Alaska...

10:13.238 --> 10:16.116
'hired by bear hunter
who turns out to be Russian spy.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.827
'Love story develops

'Eskimos do tribal dance. '
You made this up.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.040
Don't I wish!

10:23.123 --> 10:26.502
Okay, I can't wait to see
what you come up with.

10:26.585 --> 10:27.961
Bye, girls.

10:28.337 --> 10:31.089

Listen, have you seen Jess?

11:03.247 --> 11:06.458
- I think I saw him go upstairs earlier.
- Great. Thanks.

11:08.377 --> 11:10.045
Good, you're here.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.347
So, you file those under the band names?

11:20.430 --> 11:21.974
- Genre.
- Right. Genre.

11:22.057 --> 11:25.477
That makes sense. Makes a lot of sense.

11:30.274 --> 11:32.401
- What is that? Something for school?
- No.

11:32.484 --> 11:35.320
- Shouldn't you read something for school?
- Why?

11:35.404 --> 11:37.197
I mean, I know you like reading.

11:37.281 --> 11:40.492
Since you like it, you might read
something you'll get graded on...

11:40.534 --> 11:43.412
so you can get graded on
something you like...

11:43.579 --> 11:46.123
because you like reading.

11:46.248 --> 11:49.835
- What are you babbling about?
- I went to see your principal today.

11:50.627 --> 11:54.548
He says you're flunking out.
He says you're not showing up for class.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.010
He says you stole their baseballs.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.637
You stole their baseballs?
Why would you do that?

12:00.721 --> 12:03.557
What could you possible need
500 baseballs for?

12:03.724 --> 12:05.559
Could we talk about this later?

12:05.642 --> 12:08.353
Why, you got a big Frisbee heist
going down at 6:00?

12:08.395 --> 12:11.273
Jess, Mr. Merton said
if you don't start doing better...

12:11.356 --> 12:13.025
they're not gonna let you be a senior.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.401
- Bummer.
- They'll hold you back.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.445
At least I'll know where my classes are.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.572
Jess, this is serious. You're flunking out!

12:18.655 --> 12:21.116
You may be in the 11th grade
for the rest of your life!

12:21.200 --> 12:24.119
You'll be the kid in the back
with a beard and a racing form...

12:24.203 --> 12:27.039
babbling incoherently about Steely Dan.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.626
The group may change.
The freak in the back never does.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.836
- I'm going out.
- Don't you wanna go to college?

12:32.920 --> 12:35.214
- Don't wait up.
- What will you be when you grow up?

12:35.255 --> 12:39.009
- About 20 miles south of where you are.
- You have to think about the future.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.553
If you don't get through high school,
who'll hire you?

12:41.595 --> 12:42.679
You won't have any skills.

12:42.763 --> 12:45.557
- Stop.
- How are you gonna work, eat, pay rent?

12:45.641 --> 12:46.808
What are you gonna do?

12:46.892 --> 12:49.603
Jeez, I don't know.
Maybe I'll work in a diner.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.197
- Marshmallow?
- Thank you.

13:03.116 --> 13:06.286
I have now finished going through
every single one of these movies.

13:06.370 --> 13:08.664
I've read them, reviewed their merits...

13:08.747 --> 13:12.417
and I'm proud to announce
that I have chosen our movie.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.045
- How does The Yearling sound to you?
- Perfect.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.421
And bye-bye.

13:17.172 --> 13:19.967
That must be Pauline Kael
rising from the dead.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.426
Tell her, 'Hey. '

13:24.137 --> 13:25.138
- Pauline!
- What?

13:25.222 --> 13:26.765
Never mind. What are you doing here?

13:26.849 --> 13:30.185
I made some brownies.
I thought you might like some.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.689
Since I just ate a half-bag
of marshmallows, six Pop-Tarts...

13:33.772 --> 13:35.899
four bagel dogs
and a really stale Cheese Nip...

13:35.983 --> 13:37.943
it's brownie time. Thanks.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.320
- Here's a question for you.
- Yeah?

13:40.404 --> 13:43.615
You probably have a diner full of people
who'd love these brownies.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.450
Plus, I bet they'd pay you for them.

13:45.492 --> 13:49.079
I accidentally dropped triple the amount
of cocoa powder in the batter...

13:49.163 --> 13:51.832
so I either had to dump the batch
or find someone...

13:51.915 --> 13:55.502
with superhuman chocolate tolerance.
Only one name came to mind.

13:55.586 --> 13:57.963
God, I love being special.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.133
- What?
- Nothing, I just...

14:02.050 --> 14:04.011
Is Rory here, by any chance?

14:04.094 --> 14:06.305
- She's in her room.
- Can I talk to her for a sec?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.640
- Sure. Go right ahead.
- Thanks.

14:11.727 --> 14:14.646
Rory, it's Luke. Can I come in for a minute?

14:16.648 --> 14:19.443
- What's up?
- Not much. Can I...

14:20.319 --> 14:21.987
Yeah. Come on in.

14:31.205 --> 14:33.499
I see you're studying. That's good.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.375
Studying is very, very good.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.504
What you're doing right there
with the books, very good.

14:38.587 --> 14:39.963
Thank you.

14:41.006 --> 14:43.842
I wanted to ask you a favor.

14:49.139 --> 14:52.601
- I was wondering if you could tutor Jess.
- What?

14:52.684 --> 14:56.230
He's not doing well in school. The principal
says he's not gonna move on...

14:56.313 --> 14:59.399
unless something changes.
I was wondering if you could help.

14:59.483 --> 15:02.486
That doesn't make sense.
He's smart enough to pass any subject.

15:02.528 --> 15:04.154
It's not his lack of smarts.

15:04.238 --> 15:08.450
More like his lack of proximity
to the actual classes. That's the problem.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.870
What subject does he need help in?

15:11.912 --> 15:13.872
I'd say all of them, probably.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.333
I don't expect you to work miracles...

15:16.375 --> 15:18.877
and it doesn't have to be
a full-time, everyday thing.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.630
If you could get him through
a couple of his next tests...

15:21.713 --> 15:24.550
maybe make the school
see that he can do it...

15:24.633 --> 15:27.135
that would probably help out a lot.

15:27.261 --> 15:28.262
Sure.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.555
- Great. Tonight?
- Tonight...

15:29.638 --> 15:31.765
I really appreciate this.

15:34.852 --> 15:36.562
You should get back to your studying.

15:36.645 --> 15:39.106
Otherwise,
you're completely useless to me.

15:43.485 --> 15:46.113
I'll see you guys at dinner, probably.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.240
Wait. Hold on. What was that all about?

15:48.323 --> 15:50.659
Rory's gonna tutor Jess.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.870
- She is?
- Yeah. Just for a little while.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.788
Help get him on the right track.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.958
Okay. I should be getting back.
Enjoy the brownies.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.752
I'll see if I can screw up a cake
for you later on.

16:00.836 --> 16:02.337
Sounds great.

16:08.177 --> 16:10.179
Luke, hang on just a sec.

16:11.096 --> 16:14.099
Listen, about Rory
doing this tutoring thing...

16:14.183 --> 16:15.726
I really appreciate it, by the way.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.769
I know, I just... Rory's so sweet...

16:17.811 --> 16:20.189
and she'd never say no
'cause she loves to help...

16:20.272 --> 16:22.274
- but I'm not sure if it's the best idea.
- Why?

16:22.357 --> 16:24.193
She's got her own studies to worry about.

16:24.276 --> 16:27.946
I know. I promise this won't take up
all her time. It's for a little while.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.365
- Okay, but...
- Rory's pretty serious about school.

16:30.449 --> 16:32.701
She wouldn't say
she had the time if she didn't.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.912
Rory is a great student,
but she's just a kid.

16:34.953 --> 16:37.289
Don't you need a professional tutor
to help Jess?

16:37.331 --> 16:41.126
Somebody with a degree, a pipe and one
of those coats with elbow patches on it?

16:41.168 --> 16:43.253
I need someone Jess is gonna listen to.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.839
Someone he's gonna,
I don't know, look up to.

16:45.923 --> 16:49.218
That sure isn't me, and it sure isn't
some tutor. He likes Rory...

16:49.301 --> 16:53.597
and Rory's on the path that I'd like
to see Jess on: School and college.

16:53.639 --> 16:57.142
He needs to see somebody he respects
doing what he should be doing.

16:57.226 --> 17:00.103
Rory's the only one I can think of
who fits that description.

17:00.145 --> 17:03.941
- You don't know that he'll listen to Rory.
- But I gotta do something, don't I?

17:03.982 --> 17:06.443
What would you do if you were me?

17:07.319 --> 17:09.488
Just make sure
it's not too much time, okay?

17:09.570 --> 17:10.864
- I will.
- Okay.

17:10.948 --> 17:12.616
Enjoy the brownie.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.250
My God.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.336
That's good.

17:26.505 --> 17:30.843
- I need one minute of your time.
- I'll give you two because you scare me.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.345
I hear through the grapevine
that you are in charge...

17:33.387 --> 17:35.472
of selecting the movie for the movie night.

17:35.556 --> 17:37.391
- Yes, I am.
- Okay.

17:38.934 --> 17:42.563
I don't know if you know this about me,
but I have great creative ambitions.

17:42.646 --> 17:45.023
- I did not know that about you, Kirk.
- It's true.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.234
Don't get me wrong,
I love the blue-collar work.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.111
I enjoy the plight of the everyman.

17:49.194 --> 17:53.115
But as much as the mailed letter delivered
and the DSL line installed...

17:53.198 --> 17:57.244
the latest J. Lo flick rented
fills me with a deep sense of pride...

17:57.327 --> 18:01.665
- in my soul, I am Akira Kurosawa.
- Seven Samurai. Great movie.

18:01.707 --> 18:03.375
- Excuse me?
- Seven Samurai.

18:03.458 --> 18:06.712
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- Akira Kurosawa directed Seven Samurai.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.381
- It's a great Japanese movie.
- Japanese movie?

18:11.008 --> 18:13.010
I'm sorry, I have the wrong person.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.470
Who's the guy who directed
The Facts of Life?

18:15.554 --> 18:17.514
- I don't...
- Asaad Kelada. Sorry.

18:17.556 --> 18:20.184
In my soul, I know I am Asaad Kelada.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.560
What do you need?

18:21.602 --> 18:24.771
I've made a short film
that I've been working on for five years.

18:24.855 --> 18:27.983
If I rush, I can have it done by Thursday.
I'm very proud of it.

18:28.066 --> 18:31.111
I was wondering if you would screen it
before the movie tomorrow.

18:31.195 --> 18:32.946
It would mean a great deal to my career.

18:33.030 --> 18:36.408
- What kind of movie is it?
- You mean, is it 'blue'?

18:36.450 --> 18:39.411
No. Perfectly PG. It's not exactly Babe.

18:39.495 --> 18:41.079
- More like Babe 2.
- Got it.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.707
- Same pig. Harder edge.
- I hear you. I want to help.

18:43.749 --> 18:45.876
Let me think about it,
and I'll get back to you.

18:45.918 --> 18:48.587
Here's a copy of the film.
Take a look and call me.

18:48.670 --> 18:52.799
And remember, I can edit out two of the
'hells,' but I need to keep all the 'damns. '

18:52.883 --> 18:55.260
- It's a street-cred thing.
- Bye, Kirk.

18:56.345 --> 18:58.430
At least now I have
something fun to do tonight.

18:58.514 --> 19:01.767
- You're not watching that without me.
- Okay, I'll wait.

19:03.685 --> 19:06.438
- Do you want to get some pie?
- No, I'm full.

19:06.522 --> 19:08.524
- How about some coffee?
- I'm good.

19:08.607 --> 19:10.025
- Hot chocolate?
- No, thanks.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.151
Egg cream?

19:11.235 --> 19:14.988
I never had an egg cream, but it sounds
just disgusting enough to be fabulous.

19:15.072 --> 19:16.365
We're just going to study.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.617
- I know.
- And we'll be right here doing it.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.245
So this stalling is completely unnecessary.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.913
- So go.
- I will.

19:26.083 --> 19:29.086
Just finishing up the coffee that I paid for.

19:31.463 --> 19:34.007
All right, that's enough. I'm going. Bye.

19:36.009 --> 19:39.596
Mom? Listen, just in case,
and I don't think he will...

19:39.638 --> 19:41.765
if Dean calls,
will you tell him I'm with Lane?

19:41.807 --> 19:43.475
- I thought this was nothing.
- It is.

19:43.559 --> 19:45.185
- That you were just studying.
- We are.

19:45.269 --> 19:46.478
Then how come I have to lie?

19:46.520 --> 19:50.607
You know that it's not gonna be okay
with Dean if I'm studying with Jess.

19:50.691 --> 19:53.861
Maybe you shouldn't,
if you feel weird enough that I have to lie.

19:53.944 --> 19:57.322
- I'm not asking you to lie.
- You told me to say that you're with Lane.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.783
I don't see Lane here. Sounds like a lie.

19:59.825 --> 20:02.870
- Forget it. Just don't answer the phone.
- Hello? I get calls, too.

20:02.953 --> 20:05.539
I'm not What Ever Happened
to Baby Jane? Yet, thank you.

20:05.622 --> 20:08.125
Tell him that I'm studying,
which is what I am doing...

20:08.208 --> 20:10.544
so you will not be lying, okay?

20:11.336 --> 20:12.796
- Hey, Teach.
- Hey.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.883
- You guys done yet?
- Just not yet.

20:15.966 --> 20:18.343
I'll be right over there when you are.

20:18.427 --> 20:20.888
Just can't wait for that learning to begin.

20:20.971 --> 20:23.348
Are we gonna do some of those
Schoolhouse Rock songs?

20:23.432 --> 20:26.560
- I'll be right there.
- They say if you make learning fun...

20:26.643 --> 20:30.522
- Give us a minute, okay?
- Hurry, a mind is a terrible thing to waste.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.484
- I'll be home early.
- Fine.

20:36.820 --> 20:37.821
Bye, Jess.

20:37.905 --> 20:39.114
Ma'am.

20:44.703 --> 20:46.914
- Are you ready to start?
- Yes, I am.

20:46.997 --> 20:49.291
- Where are your books?
- I don't know.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.668
- How are we going to study?
- I guess we can't.

20:51.710 --> 20:54.004
- Too bad. So, what now? Movie?
- Get your books.

20:54.046 --> 20:57.382
- The cat ate them.
- Get your books or I'm going home.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.092
Wait there.

21:18.946 --> 21:22.032
Explain to me the political ramifications
of the Marshall Plan.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.575
Pick a card.

21:26.245 --> 21:29.122
- That just made the trick a little bit harder.
- Jess, focus.

21:29.206 --> 21:31.291
- Where's Dean tonight?
- We just went over this.

21:31.375 --> 21:33.001
- There's no way you forgot.
- Work?

21:33.085 --> 21:36.296
I will make you write it out 50 times
on the Specials board.

21:36.380 --> 21:39.716
If he's not at work, he must be free.
He doesn't care that you're here?

21:39.758 --> 21:41.343
No, he doesn't.

21:42.135 --> 21:44.137
- He's visiting his grandmother.
- Where?

21:44.221 --> 21:45.514
- Chicago.
- He doesn't know?

21:45.597 --> 21:47.307
- It wouldn't matter.
- You'll tell him?

21:47.391 --> 21:49.726
- We're studying.
- You're studying, I'm prying.

21:49.768 --> 21:53.021
Jess, why won't you at least try
to remember the Marshall Plan?

21:53.105 --> 21:57.150
Have you read Please Kill Me?
Oral history of the punk movement.

21:57.401 --> 21:59.486
You'd like it.
You can borrow it if you want.

21:59.570 --> 22:03.240
I'm here to help you study.
If you want me to go, I'll go.

22:03.282 --> 22:06.160
But if I'm going to stay,
then you will stop distracting me...

22:06.243 --> 22:08.162
and start paying attention, understand?

22:08.245 --> 22:09.997
- I understand.
- Good.

22:10.956 --> 22:14.293
And, yes, I would like to borrow it.
Thank you very much.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.461
Now open your book.

22:26.889 --> 22:28.015
Done.

22:30.475 --> 22:32.561
- This isn't Shakespeare.
- It's not?

22:32.644 --> 22:33.979
It's the words to a Clash song.

22:34.062 --> 22:36.815
- But which Clash song?
- I'm not the one being tested.

22:36.899 --> 22:37.941
Ten seconds.

22:37.983 --> 22:40.569
- Nine, eight, seven...
- Stop it.

22:40.652 --> 22:43.447
...six, five, four...
- You're really starting to...

22:43.488 --> 22:45.616
...three...
- Guns of Brixton.

22:45.699 --> 22:46.992
A- plus.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.912
Why did you agree to this studying thing?

22:49.995 --> 22:51.330
'Cause Luke said I had to.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.665
You've never done anything
because someone said so.

22:53.707 --> 22:56.752
- I moved because someone said I had to.
- Very different.

22:56.835 --> 22:58.754
- Do you want to get out of here?
- What?

22:58.837 --> 23:02.257
- I'm sick of studying.
- How can you be sick of studying?

23:02.341 --> 23:04.092
You haven't done any studying.

23:04.176 --> 23:06.512
You've done card tricks,
you've made coffee...

23:06.595 --> 23:07.638
you've explained to me...

23:07.679 --> 23:10.682
how on earth Coldplay
could be considered an alternative band...

23:10.724 --> 23:12.684
but as of yet, no studying.

23:12.726 --> 23:13.977
That's your car?

23:14.061 --> 23:15.354
Yes, it is.

23:17.606 --> 23:21.652
I'll tell you what, let's go get
some ice cream, when we get back...

23:21.693 --> 23:24.196
- I'll study.
- This is a diner. There's ice cream here.

23:24.238 --> 23:25.781
- But we don't have any cones.
- Cones.

23:25.864 --> 23:28.700
- I need cones.
- So, if we go get ice cream...

23:28.742 --> 23:31.078
- In cones.
- Then you'll be a perfect student...

23:31.161 --> 23:33.288
- for the rest of the night?
- That's right.

23:33.372 --> 23:36.458
I could not believe you less.
Here. You drive.

23:36.542 --> 23:40.671
- I'll read you Othello. Won't that be fun?
- You have no idea how much.

23:44.883 --> 23:47.344
Admit it, it's always better in a cone.

23:48.095 --> 23:50.556
Putting ice cream in a dish?
Eating it with a spoon?

23:50.639 --> 23:52.266
What is wrong with people?

23:52.349 --> 23:54.059
- Hold the wheel.
- What?

23:54.142 --> 23:57.604
- I'm dripping. Hold the wheel.
- I can't. You're driving.

23:57.688 --> 24:01.733
The person who drives holds the wheel.
That's what they teach you in driver's ed.

24:01.817 --> 24:04.528
I got to take that class one of these days.
Take the wheel.

24:04.570 --> 24:07.072
- I'm letting go.
- Stop. Take it back.

24:07.114 --> 24:10.534
You are taking this wheel back,
and when you do, I'm going to kill you.

24:10.576 --> 24:13.620
- I'm just letting you know that.
- I appreciate the warning.

24:13.871 --> 24:15.164
I got it.

24:16.081 --> 24:17.958
Jeez, you look pale. You okay?

24:18.041 --> 24:21.253
- Death. And it's going to be painful.
- You're not gonna kill me.

24:21.336 --> 24:24.256
Think how dull your life
would be without me.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.050
- Serious question?
- Okay.

24:27.134 --> 24:29.678
You're smarter than almost everybody
at your school.

24:29.761 --> 24:31.638
It takes you five minutes to finish a book.

24:31.722 --> 24:35.559
You read and remember everything.
You could ace those classes easily.

24:35.601 --> 24:37.227
Why don't you?

24:37.603 --> 24:38.937
You don't need a tutor.

24:39.021 --> 24:41.481
It's crazy that they're talking
about leaving you back.

24:41.565 --> 24:43.275
- Whatever.
- You could do anything.

24:43.358 --> 24:45.277
You could be anything you wanted.

24:45.736 --> 24:47.362
Is it, like, a 'cooI' thing?

24:47.446 --> 24:50.824
- I could care less about being cool.
- Inform me, please.

24:51.116 --> 24:53.827
I'm never going to college.
Why waste time in high school?

24:53.911 --> 24:56.288
- Why aren't you going to college?
- Please.

24:56.330 --> 24:58.874
What? 'Please' what?
Why is that so crazy?

24:58.957 --> 25:01.460
Ask my mother.
She could give you a couple reasons.

25:01.543 --> 25:05.172
And I'm sure Principal Merton
can chime in with a few good ones.

25:05.255 --> 25:08.634
In fact, ask your mother.
She doesn't know me all that well...

25:08.717 --> 25:10.969
but I'm sure she could improvise
a few things.

25:11.011 --> 25:12.554
Don't give me that whole...

25:12.638 --> 25:15.015
'I'm so misunderstood,'
Kurt Cobain-y thing.

25:15.098 --> 25:17.851
You are way stronger than that,
and I don't want to hear it.

25:17.935 --> 25:20.646
- You have to go to college.
- No, you have to go to college.

25:20.729 --> 25:22.689
Don't you have any plans?

25:22.773 --> 25:24.983
- I plan to get out of Stars Hollow.
- And go where?

25:25.025 --> 25:26.068
- Wherever.
- And do what?

25:26.151 --> 25:27.819
- Whatever.
- 'Whenever. ' 'Whatever. '

25:27.903 --> 25:30.364
I'll live where I live,
I'll work when I need money...

25:30.447 --> 25:33.575
- and I'll see where I end up.
- You could do more.

25:33.826 --> 25:36.495
- Here come the pompons.
- No pompons.

25:36.537 --> 25:38.997
Just me saying, 'You could do more. '

25:41.124 --> 25:45.087
- So, Courtney, what about you?
- What about me?

25:45.170 --> 25:47.840
- What are your big ambitions?
- Harvard.

25:47.923 --> 25:50.676
- And after Harvard?
- I'm gonna be a journalist.

25:50.759 --> 25:53.095
- Paula Zahn?
- Christiane Amanpour.

25:53.178 --> 25:54.847
- An overseas correspondent?
- Yes.

25:54.930 --> 25:58.350
You're gonna crawl around in trenches
and stand on top of buildings...

25:58.433 --> 26:00.602
and have bombs going off
in the background...

26:00.686 --> 26:02.521
and civil wars raging all around you?

26:02.563 --> 26:04.022
What? You don't think I can do it?

26:04.064 --> 26:08.360
- No, I do. It just sounds a little too...
- A little what?

26:08.861 --> 26:10.487
A little too rough for you.

26:10.529 --> 26:13.031
It's not a little too rough for me.

26:15.117 --> 26:19.121
I hope it's not a little too rough for me.
I've been talking about this forever.

26:19.204 --> 26:20.873
I don't even know what I would do if...

26:20.956 --> 26:24.793
I didn't mean to freak you out.
I'm sorry. I'm sure you'll do it.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.546
You will. I promise.

26:28.589 --> 26:30.382
I'll help you practice, okay?

26:30.424 --> 26:34.011
Tomorrow, you'll stand in the middle
of the street, and I'll drive at you...

26:34.094 --> 26:36.054
screaming in a foreign language.

26:36.096 --> 26:38.515
You're gonna have to learn
a foreign language first.

26:38.557 --> 26:41.393
It's lucky I've got me a tutor, isn't it?

26:49.443 --> 26:51.445
So I guess we should be getting back.

26:51.528 --> 26:54.531
I did promise to study
if you went on this ice-cream run with me.

26:54.573 --> 26:57.910
- You did.
- I'll go straight, and we're back at Luke's.

26:57.951 --> 26:59.912
Good sense of direction.

27:00.412 --> 27:02.164
Of course, I could turn right...

27:02.247 --> 27:05.751
then we'd just be driving around
in circles for a while.

27:08.504 --> 27:11.507
- Turn right.
- As you wish.

27:23.769 --> 27:27.648
Great. Was it the China Ball,
the China Doll or the China Wall...

27:27.731 --> 27:29.483
that had the really good shrimp balls?

27:29.566 --> 27:32.569
- I think it was the China Doll.
- Okay, these can go.

27:32.653 --> 27:35.572
You'll be so proud of me.
I'm organizing the takeout drawer.

27:35.614 --> 27:39.910
I'm weeding out the dogs, and I'm putting
happy-face stickers on the dishes...

27:39.952 --> 27:42.788
that have been successes
to make our ordering more efficient.

27:42.871 --> 27:44.289
- Where are you?
- Be calm.

27:44.373 --> 27:47.417
- Calm about what?
- Calm about what I have to tell you.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.586
- Where are you?
- I'm all right.

27:49.628 --> 27:51.505
Of course. Why wouldn't you be all right?

27:51.588 --> 27:55.050
- Because I got in an accident.
- What?

27:55.425 --> 27:57.594
What accident? What do you mean?

27:57.678 --> 28:00.639
Jess and I went for ice cream
and we were just driving...

28:00.681 --> 28:03.433
and it was dark,
and this dog or cat or possum...

28:03.475 --> 28:07.354
it was small and furry, it ran out into
the middle of the road and Jess swerved...

28:07.437 --> 28:09.314
- Jess swerved? Jess was driving?
- Yes.

28:09.356 --> 28:11.316
Jess was driving,
and you got in an accident?

28:11.400 --> 28:14.653
But I'm fine, and he's fine.
And the furry thing is fine.

28:14.736 --> 28:17.823
The car's a bit messed up,
but there's nothing to be worried about.

28:17.906 --> 28:20.993
- Where are you?
- I'm in the hospital.

28:25.956 --> 28:29.334
Hi, excuse me. My daughter's here.
She was in a car accident.

28:29.418 --> 28:31.837
- Her name is Rory Gilmore.
- Okay, just take a seat.

28:31.879 --> 28:34.548
- I don't want to take a seat.
- It'll be one minute.

28:34.631 --> 28:36.008
Remember in Terms of Endearment...

28:36.091 --> 28:38.010
where Shirley MacLaine's in the hospital...

28:38.051 --> 28:40.137
and freaks when her daughter
doesn't get a shot?

28:40.179 --> 28:42.014
She got that from me
and she toned it down.

28:42.055 --> 28:45.350
So once again, I'm looking
for my daughter, Rory Gilmore.

28:46.018 --> 28:48.520
- First door on your left.
- Thank you.

28:52.524 --> 28:54.568
Good. Are you okay?

28:54.651 --> 28:57.779
I'm fine. Please tell her that I'm fine.

28:57.988 --> 28:59.907
- She's fine.
- What's with the wrapping?

28:59.990 --> 29:04.244
- There's no wrapping if she's fine.
- Her arm hit the dashboard.

29:04.328 --> 29:06.705
She sustained a minor hairline fracture
to her wrist.

29:06.747 --> 29:08.790
- She broke her wrist?
- It's just a fracture.

29:08.874 --> 29:12.336
- Let George Clooney talk here.
- It's a tiny fracture. Nothing serious.

29:12.419 --> 29:15.005
I'll put a cast on it.
She'll wear it for a couple weeks.

29:15.047 --> 29:17.466
- A cast?
- It barely hurts, I swear.

29:17.549 --> 29:19.843
That's it? Just the wrist?
Everything else is fine?

29:19.885 --> 29:22.137
- She seems perfectly healthy.
- She 'seems healthy'?

29:22.221 --> 29:25.349
- You checked everything?
- Almost all that could have been affected.

29:25.390 --> 29:28.060
- Almost?
- I assure you, we were very thorough.

29:28.143 --> 29:30.145
I'm sure, I would like some extra thorough.

29:30.229 --> 29:33.315
Anything that could have,
in any scenario, affected this body...

29:33.398 --> 29:34.399
I want it checked out.

29:34.483 --> 29:36.527
I'll run more x-rays
if it makes you feel better.

29:36.568 --> 29:37.569
It will. Thanks.

29:37.653 --> 29:40.864
Then we'll put the cast on
so it'll be a while before she can leave.

29:40.906 --> 29:42.324
- I can wait.
- Okay.

29:42.407 --> 29:45.661
Rory, I'll be right back.
You sit still for a minute, okay?

29:49.623 --> 29:52.167
- The car's not so good.
- Nobody cares about the car.

29:52.251 --> 29:55.087
Jess made sure he called
the ambulance and I was okay...

29:55.128 --> 29:59.091
- before he even talked to the police...
- Let's just hear about the details later.

29:59.174 --> 30:01.093
I just want you to relax now.

30:01.134 --> 30:03.637
- You're not mad?
- No, I'm not mad.

30:03.887 --> 30:06.139
So they brought you in the ambulance?

30:06.223 --> 30:08.809
Did they use the siren?
I hope Taylor was in bed.

30:08.892 --> 30:10.894
It was after 9:00, so there's a good chance.

30:10.936 --> 30:11.937
Nice.

30:12.020 --> 30:15.023
Rory, I'm gonna have the nurse take
you down to X-Ray.

30:15.107 --> 30:17.568
- Can I go with her?
- No, you have to wait outside.

30:17.609 --> 30:20.529
It'll be about an hour.
If you want to grab some coffee...

30:20.612 --> 30:24.074
Okay. Thanks. Smile pretty for the camera.

30:51.685 --> 30:53.270
- Where is he?
- Who?

30:53.312 --> 30:56.106
- Where's Jess, Luke?
- I don't know. I just got back.

30:56.148 --> 30:58.859
What's going on?
I got here. They weren't here.

31:00.485 --> 31:01.862
Talk to me.

31:03.030 --> 31:04.490
Jess, answer me right now.

31:04.531 --> 31:05.657
What's wrong? What happened?

31:05.741 --> 31:07.409
- There was an accident.
- What accident?

31:08.827 --> 31:11.246
Jess was driving Rory's car,
and he crashed it.

31:11.330 --> 31:14.500
- What? When?
- He crashed it tonight.

31:14.541 --> 31:17.252
- Damn it.
- What happened? Is anyone hurt?

31:19.546 --> 31:21.006
I'm talking to you.

31:21.089 --> 31:23.425
- Where would he go?
- I asked you if anyone was hurt.

31:23.509 --> 31:25.052
Was anyone hurt? Let's see...

31:25.135 --> 31:29.097
Rory's in the emergency room with a
fractured wrist. Yes, someone was hurt.

31:29.181 --> 31:31.808
- Rory fractured her wrist?
- She has to wear a cast.

31:31.892 --> 31:33.519
She's getting x-rays and tests.

31:33.602 --> 31:36.605
- What about Jess? Is he hurt?
- No, Jess did the hurting.

31:36.688 --> 31:39.566
That little punk nephew of yours
almost killed my kid tonight.

31:39.650 --> 31:41.652
I'm sure it was an accident.
Accidents happen.

31:41.735 --> 31:44.196
- Not with my kid in the car.
- Calm down.

31:44.238 --> 31:46.365
- Why did you do this?
- Why did I do what?

31:46.448 --> 31:48.033
- Why did you bring him here?
- What?

31:48.116 --> 31:50.828
If you hadn't brought him here,
this wouldn't have happened.

31:50.869 --> 31:52.830
- This is my fault?
- Yes, it is your fault.

31:52.871 --> 31:54.832
You told him to come and let him stay.

31:54.873 --> 31:57.376
Everybody hated him,
everybody knew he was trouble...

31:57.417 --> 31:59.545
but you wouldn't listen or send him home.

31:59.628 --> 32:02.381
And now my daughter is in the hospital.

32:05.968 --> 32:09.304
You kept pushing them together.
You asked her to help him study.

32:09.388 --> 32:12.349
You knew she'd never say no.
I told you it made me nervous.

32:12.391 --> 32:15.185
I told you I didn't like it,
and I should have stopped it.

32:15.227 --> 32:18.438
You thought Rory'd be good for Jess,
never mind what he'd be to her.

32:18.522 --> 32:20.399
- That wasn't important.
- Of course it was.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.360
Why didn't you put a stop to it
at the first sign of trouble?

32:23.402 --> 32:26.738
- Why didn't you make him leave?
- He's my nephew. I had an obligation.

32:26.822 --> 32:30.450
- I had an obligation to care for him.
- You had an obligation to this town...

32:30.534 --> 32:34.121
- to me and to Rory. Where are you going?
- I have to find out where Jess is.

32:34.204 --> 32:35.706
I'll tell you where he's not:

32:35.789 --> 32:38.625
In the emergency room,
having his arm plastered up.

32:39.084 --> 32:43.630
I am sorry about Rory. You know I care
more about her than I do myself.

32:43.714 --> 32:46.717
At least you know where Rory is,
and that she's okay.

32:46.758 --> 32:49.928
I have to find Jess,
and make sure that he's okay.

32:50.012 --> 32:53.348
If that cuts into your screaming time,
that's too damn bad!

32:53.432 --> 32:55.642
- Go to hell!
- Right back at you.

33:21.793 --> 33:23.045
Chris?

33:44.816 --> 33:48.028
- I made sure she was okay.
- I know you did.

34:02.668 --> 34:04.294
Okay, you got your TV...

34:04.336 --> 34:08.465
your books, magazines,
refreshments, CD player, assorted CDs...

34:08.507 --> 34:11.051
Stan Freberg.
You have your Sinéad O'Connor...

34:11.134 --> 34:12.969
because when life really gets you down...

34:13.011 --> 34:15.304
Sinéad's the one
to teach you some perspective.

34:15.347 --> 34:18.851
There's a pad and paper if you decide
to write the great American novel...

34:18.934 --> 34:23.105
and over here,
you have a tiny-but-annoying bell...

34:23.188 --> 34:25.023
in case there's something that you need...

34:25.107 --> 34:28.527
and you want to summon
the common-but-lovely house-wench...

34:28.569 --> 34:30.154
who will leave her talking mice...

34:30.195 --> 34:32.531
and come to fetch the Contessa
whatever she needs.

34:32.572 --> 34:34.949
I think what Contessa
requires right now is sleep.

34:35.033 --> 34:36.409
Is your arm hurting you?

34:36.493 --> 34:38.954
But the stuff they gave me
made me a little dopey.

34:39.036 --> 34:42.916
My little Marianne Faithfull.
Scooch down now and go to sleep.

34:47.462 --> 34:51.132
- What are you doing?
- Just a little feng shui. Go to sleep.

34:52.301 --> 34:54.428
You don't have to sleep in here tonight.

34:54.511 --> 34:57.389
- I think the chair looks nice here.
- What's the blanket for?

34:57.472 --> 34:59.308
- In case the chair gets cold.
- The pillow?

34:59.391 --> 35:02.352
To keep the blanket company.
Okay, everything's in its place.

35:02.436 --> 35:06.023
Chair seems warm, blanket seems happy.
Just one thing missing.

35:08.066 --> 35:09.067
Good night.

35:09.151 --> 35:12.237
- Freak of sideshow proportions.
- I love you, too.

35:17.326 --> 35:18.744
I'm sorry.

35:19.745 --> 35:21.955
The chair is trying to sleep.

36:12.631 --> 36:14.216
What are you doing here?

36:14.299 --> 36:16.677
I have a really crappy mattress at home.

36:17.094 --> 36:19.972
I drove here as fast as I could,
and I went to the hospital...

36:20.055 --> 36:23.600
but you had left, so I tried your phone,
but all I got was the voicemail.

36:23.684 --> 36:28.605
I came here but the place looked dark, so I
got the key out of the turtle and came in...

36:28.647 --> 36:32.651
but you guys were already asleep,
so I just grabbed a chair and...

36:33.152 --> 36:36.321
And apparently my evil plan
worked exactly as I anticipated.

36:36.405 --> 36:38.824
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Me, too.

36:40.784 --> 36:42.870
- How's she doing?
- She's in a cast.

36:42.953 --> 36:44.997
- I know.
- The doctor said she'll be fine.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.457
He'll take it off in a couple of weeks.

36:47.541 --> 36:49.376
The car is totally gone.

36:50.586 --> 36:53.630
I have to call the insurance guy tomorrow,
and I don't know...

36:53.714 --> 36:55.591
- Did you find that kid?
- Jess?

36:55.674 --> 36:57.759
'Jess. ' 'Dead meat. '
Whatever his name is.

36:57.843 --> 37:00.596
No. Little ferret's
hiding out somewhere, I'm sure.

37:00.679 --> 37:05.058
I'm gonna deal with the car tomorrow,
and I'll talk to the doctor if that's okay.

37:05.142 --> 37:06.476
I'll need a picture of Jess...

37:06.518 --> 37:08.687
so I don't rip off
the head of the wrong kid...

37:08.770 --> 37:10.189
'cause that would be bad.

37:10.272 --> 37:13.192
- Look at you, all springing into action.
- About time, isn't it?

37:13.275 --> 37:15.569
- I like the superhero you.
- Just trying to keep up.

37:15.652 --> 37:19.656
Are you staying here tonight
or do you have to rush back?

37:19.740 --> 37:24.161
- I want to spend time with Rory tomorrow.
- Sherrie's cool with you staying here?

37:24.203 --> 37:25.871
Rory comes first.

37:27.998 --> 37:30.667
- Do you want some coffee?
- I'll get it.

37:31.543 --> 37:33.128
Do you know how to make coffee?

37:33.212 --> 37:34.838
- Yes, I do.
- My coffee?

37:34.880 --> 37:38.258
- One bag of coffee per cup of water, right?
- Perfect.

37:39.551 --> 37:40.886
Oh, my God.

37:41.053 --> 37:44.640
You know, when Rory called me tonight
and said the word 'hospitaI'...

37:44.723 --> 37:47.768
I just legitimately thought
I was having a heart attack.

37:47.851 --> 37:50.395
And let me tell you, it was not fun.
I'm joining a gym.

37:50.479 --> 37:53.565
- That's how not-fun it was.
- Can you get a two-for-one membership?

37:53.649 --> 37:55.067
Anything could've happened.

37:55.150 --> 37:57.402
- It could have been so much worse.
- It wasn't.

37:57.444 --> 37:59.947
- No, it wasn't, but it could have been.
- It wasn't.

38:00.489 --> 38:02.658
Everything's gonna be okay.

38:02.866 --> 38:05.327
About the fight we had
the last time you were here...

38:05.410 --> 38:08.789
- That was a doozy, wasn't it?
- I just... I didn't mean to...

38:09.873 --> 38:12.042
- I shouldn't have...
- No, but if I implied that...

38:12.125 --> 38:13.710
You didn't. I just snapped.

38:13.752 --> 38:15.712
- I understand.
- I'm sorry.

38:15.754 --> 38:16.964
Me, too.

38:22.302 --> 38:25.264
Did I mention I'm really glad you're here?

38:26.598 --> 38:28.225
I believe you did.

38:29.393 --> 38:31.019
Good for me then.

38:41.613 --> 38:43.740
- The Yearling?
- Great movie.

38:43.824 --> 38:46.618
You'd think they'd have gotten
the genius in charge of this...

38:46.702 --> 38:48.453
to come up with something
other than that.

38:48.537 --> 38:52.249
Picking a movie that will appeal
to a large group of people is hard.

38:53.167 --> 38:56.170
- We'll get seats.
- Oh, my God. Let me see.

38:56.670 --> 38:58.005
That sucks.

38:58.505 --> 39:01.341
- Does it hurt?
- Only when I remember how I got it.

39:01.425 --> 39:03.343
Here. Angry Girl for an angry arm.

39:03.427 --> 39:05.804
- Cool. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:06.138 --> 39:07.931
So, tell me what happened.

39:07.973 --> 39:12.561
It was horrible. I have never been involved
in anything so horrible in my life.

39:12.644 --> 39:13.687
But what happened?

39:13.770 --> 39:17.649
An animal ran out into the road
and we swerved and hit a pole.

39:17.733 --> 39:19.860
- And my beautiful car...
- How bad?

39:19.943 --> 39:22.779
- Have you talked to Dean?
- No, he gets home tomorrow.

39:22.821 --> 39:24.573
- What are you gonna say?
- I don't know.

39:24.656 --> 39:27.993
- He's gonna freak. And Jess?
- Not since last night.

39:29.369 --> 39:31.830
Yeah, everyone is so upset right now.

39:31.955 --> 39:35.000
My dad's in town and something
happened between Mom and Luke...

39:35.083 --> 39:37.586
and she won't tell me what. I don't know.

39:37.794 --> 39:41.715
They just need time to cool off
and then everything will be fine.

39:41.798 --> 39:44.676
Everyone just needs time.
Maybe I'll try to call him tomorrow.

39:44.760 --> 39:47.679
Tomorrow. That's plenty of time.
No one will still be mad then.

39:47.763 --> 39:51.391
- Sarcasm does not become you.
- Maybe not, but it does sustain me.

39:51.725 --> 39:55.020
- Why isn't Jackson here?
- He's singing to his persimmons tonight.

39:55.062 --> 39:57.523
- They've been a little sour lately.
- Right.

39:57.564 --> 40:01.109
- Right? You just accept that explanation?
- Why shouldn't I?

40:01.193 --> 40:04.863
She just told you the man
is not here because he's singing to fruit.

40:05.030 --> 40:08.492
That's better than dancing with it.
Remember last year's watermelon crop?

40:08.575 --> 40:10.661
Yeah. Threw his back out.

40:10.911 --> 40:12.955
Okay, I'm facing the screen now.

40:13.038 --> 40:15.457
The movie's starting?
I thought it started at 8:00.

40:15.541 --> 40:17.876
This is a little pre-movie treat.

40:25.384 --> 40:28.345
- I can't wait to meet your family.
- I'm very close to my family.

40:28.387 --> 40:31.265
I know this. That's why
I can't wait to meet your family.

40:31.348 --> 40:35.227
Remember, Daddy is quite protective.
I'm his favorite daughter.

40:35.310 --> 40:36.854
He has good taste.

40:36.937 --> 40:39.606
- I intend to tell him that.
- I love you.

40:43.735 --> 40:46.196
- Daddy.
- You are with my favorite daughter.

40:46.238 --> 40:48.490
- You have good taste.
- Come in the house.

40:48.574 --> 40:49.950
I love you.

41:07.384 --> 41:10.345
- I love your daughter.
- Who are you to love my daughter?

41:10.429 --> 41:13.140
- What do you have to offer her?
- Nothing.

41:13.473 --> 41:14.850
Only this.

41:27.905 --> 41:31.575
- He raps later.
- Jackson needs to see this.

41:31.909 --> 41:33.619
If I can get him here quick enough...

41:33.702 --> 41:35.871
We are so playing this again
after the movie.

41:35.954 --> 41:37.748
Great. I'll be back.

41:39.208 --> 41:42.544
This town is like
one big outpatient mental institution.

41:42.628 --> 41:44.922
- Glad you could join us.
- Yeah, me, too.

41:49.885 --> 41:52.763
It's so nice you decided
to stay for the movie.

41:52.804 --> 41:54.932
I mean, it's really fun being able to say:

41:55.015 --> 41:57.434
'Look, I know that person.
I talk to him every day...

41:57.476 --> 41:59.019
'and so far, he's never bitten me. '

42:01.563 --> 42:04.900
I'm definitely coming around more often.
You need protection.

42:04.983 --> 42:09.071
- Coming around more often sounds good.
- I wish I could stay longer.

42:09.154 --> 42:11.323
You gotta get back to Sherrie.

42:11.657 --> 42:15.244
- Don't worry. We understand.
- Yeah, I wish I could stay.

42:17.079 --> 42:19.498
Where did Sookie go? Oh, my Lord!

42:19.706 --> 42:23.293
Quick, cover her eyes. She's just a child.
She shouldn't have to see this.

42:23.335 --> 42:26.046
- He's taking his shirt off.
- I shouldn't have to see this.

42:26.129 --> 42:27.631
- I'm going for popcorn.
- Me, please.

42:27.714 --> 42:30.008
- Me, too.
- Got it. Be right back.

42:32.636 --> 42:35.514
- I like it when he's here.
- Yeah. Me, too.

42:37.015 --> 42:38.350
Let's eat.

42:53.782 --> 42:55.367
I did the choreography.

42:55.868 --> 42:58.120
- Patty, doll, come here.
- I'll see you later.

42:58.203 --> 42:59.788
Bye, Patty.

43:02.124 --> 43:03.458
How are you feeling?

43:03.542 --> 43:05.669
Haunted by the sight of Kirk's bare chest.

43:05.711 --> 43:07.754
- No!
- I swear to God!

43:07.838 --> 43:09.214
- When?
- Last night...

43:09.256 --> 43:11.175
not long after the accident happened...

43:11.216 --> 43:14.344
Luke walked him
straight to the bus station...

43:14.386 --> 43:16.096
stuck the kid on a bus,
sent him home to his mom's.

43:16.180 --> 43:18.640
I can't believe Luke
would send him off like that.

43:18.724 --> 43:20.350
I heard the kid wanted to go.

43:20.392 --> 43:24.104
I don't know.
All I know is that Jess is gone.

43:26.982 --> 43:29.735
What will we do
for entertainment around here?

43:29.776 --> 43:31.778
Beats the hell out of me.

44:17.825 --> 44:18.826
English
