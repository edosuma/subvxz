WEBVTT

03:21.375 --> 03:22.463
Yes.

03:29.818 --> 03:30.688
You failed.

03:30.862 --> 03:31.907
I didn't.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.998
The gun is in my hand.

03:37.086 --> 03:38.566
I thought I had it.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.961
Sorry, Father.
I'll make it next time.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.268
Never take anything
for granted.

03:46.443 --> 03:47.923
God will take it from you.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.187
Is God bad?

03:54.843 --> 03:55.757
God is fair.

03:59.717 --> 04:02.416
You almost got me,
didn't you, boy?

04:22.914 --> 04:24.916
Did I get my white hair from you

04:25.090 --> 04:26.266
or from Mom?

04:29.007 --> 04:30.400
From your mother.

04:30.574 --> 04:33.403
I can't believe we don't have
any pictures of her.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.710
Everything was destroyed
in the fire.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.364
You know that.

04:37.538 --> 04:39.235
I could only save you.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.154
Was she beautiful?

04:50.507 --> 04:51.726
She was smart.

04:54.424 --> 04:55.686
Like you.

04:56.905 --> 04:58.123
How many did I get?

04:58.298 --> 04:59.647
All of them.

05:02.214 --> 05:05.130
So I get to go
to town today, right?

05:08.003 --> 05:09.657
You failed survival.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.269
It's been three months.

05:14.749 --> 05:18.056
Plus, I just gave you
a killer haircut.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.797
Trust me.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.585
You need to pass
all your tests first.

05:36.901 --> 05:39.513
All right,
apart from the usual,

05:39.687 --> 05:42.211
I have an order of
five ferns,

05:42.385 --> 05:43.517
two ficuses,

05:43.691 --> 05:46.041
and the Columnea grandiosa.

05:47.085 --> 05:48.348
Gloriosa.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.437
Gloriosa.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.352
Am I taking Phoenix today?

05:52.526 --> 05:53.527
Not today.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.355
It's been a while.

05:55.529 --> 05:56.791
I said, no.

06:01.404 --> 06:03.058
You either loosen up
that leash,

06:03.232 --> 06:05.626
or sooner or later,
she's gonna bite it off.

06:19.770 --> 06:20.989
Go with Hernandez.

06:25.689 --> 06:27.169
Back by sunset!

06:27.343 --> 06:28.605
I will.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.350
Hey, Hernandez.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.178
Hey, gorgeous.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.027
That's beautiful.

06:59.201 --> 07:01.464
You made that up?

07:01.638 --> 07:04.598
I think my mom sang it to me
when I was little.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.817
That first part's
all I remember.

07:06.991 --> 07:08.906
You wanna pay her a visit?

07:10.995 --> 07:14.477
But my father doesn't want me--I won't tell if you don't.

08:12.927 --> 08:17.061
REPORTER
Police have issued a statewide
alert for Dr. Thomas Hanniman,

08:17.235 --> 08:19.499
who's believed to be running
an organ trafficking ring

08:19.673 --> 08:21.675
in the Detroit area.Thank you.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.285
The alarming number
of abductions

08:23.459 --> 08:25.113
has recently risen in the city.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.289
This is a developing story.
We'll update you

08:27.463 --> 08:29.247
as more information
comes to light.

08:29.421 --> 08:31.772
Now let's take a look
at the weekend forecast.

08:31.946 --> 08:34.905
JERRY
Good morning, everyone.
I'm meteorologist Jerry...

08:42.957 --> 08:46.221
Everyone, pull. Help me.

08:46.395 --> 08:47.265
It's stuck.

08:50.878 --> 08:53.097
Hey, wanna try something?

08:53.271 --> 08:54.403
Okay.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.930
Do it.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.636
Faster, faster.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.333
I'm getting dizzy.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.169
Hey, guys. Come on in. Dinner.

09:23.432 --> 09:24.999
But I don't wanna go inside.

09:25.173 --> 09:26.566
Come on, guys!

09:28.306 --> 09:29.699
"Covenant Shelter."

09:30.961 --> 09:32.310
Race you.

09:32.484 --> 09:34.399
Hey, wait up!

09:39.491 --> 09:41.189
You having fun?Mm-hm.

09:41.363 --> 09:42.886
All right, let's go.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.235
I need to pee.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.628
Okay, well, be quick.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.717
I don't wanna anger your father.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.704
Wow, you're pretty.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.447
What's your name, gorgeous?

10:22.622 --> 10:23.927
Mine's Raylan.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.887
I don't care.

10:28.758 --> 10:31.631
I need to go.
My father's waiting for me.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.989
I snap my fingers

10:42.163 --> 10:43.730
and he'll bite
your testicles off.

10:45.470 --> 10:46.950
Wow.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.822
Okay.

10:48.996 --> 10:52.652
Well, I'm sorry if I scared you.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.479
Who said you did?

11:06.187 --> 11:08.015
I'll see you around.

11:08.189 --> 11:09.756
Come on, Shadow.

11:17.241 --> 11:18.590
You okay?

11:18.765 --> 11:19.679
Yes.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.332
Just a weirdo.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.334
Yeah.

11:23.508 --> 11:26.033
No shortage of those
around here.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.178
Follow them.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.538
Thanks, Hernandez.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.150
We had a lot of fun today.

11:56.324 --> 11:58.500
I'll take her again next week
if you're okay with it.

11:58.674 --> 11:59.893
No.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.503
Today was enough.

12:07.422 --> 12:10.033
It's none of my business, but--You're right.

12:11.426 --> 12:12.644
It's not.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.084
You're a bad man.

12:20.174 --> 12:22.045
A man who's done
terrible things.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.531
At least, I know you think that.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.968
Just like sometimes
I do about myself.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.756
War changes us all.

12:36.930 --> 12:39.759
No soul returns holy from it.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.414
Don't make her pay for that.

12:47.462 --> 12:48.724
Thanks.

14:00.709 --> 14:04.669
You mind moving your vehicle
off the road, please?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.236
This is...

14:08.630 --> 14:11.285
This is the only road
back to town.

14:12.808 --> 14:13.678
You served?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.419
Yeah.

14:15.593 --> 14:16.812
We all did too.

14:18.074 --> 14:20.076
Iraq?
Yeah.

14:20.250 --> 14:24.254
Dishonorably discharged
from a dishonorable war.

14:26.517 --> 14:30.652
I'd say that makes us
honorable somehow. Wouldn't you?

14:30.826 --> 14:32.088
No.

14:33.829 --> 14:37.050
Can you move your truck
off the road now?

14:40.662 --> 14:42.533
Sure, baby.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.709
Whatever you want.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.741
Lessons next month.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.309
Okay.

16:02.483 --> 16:05.790
I wanna go to school next year.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.010
This is school--A real school,

16:08.184 --> 16:09.490
with other kids like me.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.144
Homeschool is safer.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.146
I don't wanna be safe.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.975
I wanna be normal.
I wanna have friends.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.412
I wanna live a--Enough!

16:18.586 --> 16:19.848
Enough.

16:21.589 --> 16:24.287
I already lost a daughter once.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.028
I'm not losing you.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.812
But I'm lonely.

16:29.771 --> 16:32.252
You have no idea
what it is to be alone.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.559
You have me.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.000
You're not enough.

17:43.584 --> 17:44.846
"Covenant Shelter.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.979
Your new home awaits you."

19:04.578 --> 19:05.796
Shadow?

19:49.405 --> 19:51.407
Shadow?

24:40.304 --> 24:41.610
Shadow.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.052
Oh, God.

26:51.871 --> 26:54.047
The box! Now!

26:56.005 --> 26:56.919
Go!

27:13.980 --> 27:15.416
Go get the girl.

27:30.910 --> 27:31.824
Open the door.

27:33.652 --> 27:34.653
Open up!

30:01.234 --> 30:03.410
What the fuck?

30:03.584 --> 30:04.846
Oh!

30:07.806 --> 30:09.329
Hang on, brother.

30:22.864 --> 30:24.474
Open your jaw.

30:24.648 --> 30:27.216
Stay still.

30:31.481 --> 30:32.831
Breathe, brother.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.851
The guy's a Navy SEAL.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.911
Fucking dead SEAL, bro.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.539
Better get out of there, kid.

32:24.594 --> 32:26.945
He's down there with you!

32:27.119 --> 32:29.860
Blind fuck is down there!

32:47.356 --> 32:48.531
Call Raylan.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.917
Metal box
is almost full of water.

33:30.269 --> 33:31.966
You prefer
to see the kid alive...

33:34.577 --> 33:36.014
you come in here.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.540
You think I'm fucking with you?

33:45.197 --> 33:46.459
No.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.941
There's a live wire
about to reach the water.

33:51.116 --> 33:52.943
Come out, or she's fried!

34:08.610 --> 34:09.960
Clever fuck.

34:11.005 --> 34:12.440
No guns, huh?

34:13.703 --> 34:15.053
No problem.

36:50.730 --> 36:51.948
You're tough.

36:53.428 --> 36:55.038
But you're done.

37:06.963 --> 37:08.051
What the fuck?

37:08.226 --> 37:09.575
Yo, bro.

38:27.783 --> 38:30.656
Breathe.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.005
Come on, breathe.

38:32.179 --> 38:35.008
Breathe.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.357
Breathe.

38:42.450 --> 38:44.713
The old blind man did this?

38:44.887 --> 38:46.324
Uh-huh.

38:49.283 --> 38:50.371
Let's go.

39:07.083 --> 39:08.650
I can walk.

39:08.824 --> 39:10.304
I said, I can walk.

39:13.481 --> 39:14.874
What's happening?

39:26.581 --> 39:27.669
Cover the exits.

39:40.116 --> 39:42.075
What the fuck?

40:09.668 --> 40:11.278
They're still down here.

40:41.743 --> 40:43.005
What's happening?

40:44.529 --> 40:46.574
Who are they?I don't know.

41:31.140 --> 41:33.621
You don't need to be afraid,
little girl.

41:35.797 --> 41:38.713
This has all just been
one big misunderstanding.

41:50.464 --> 41:52.510
It's not me
you need to be scared of...

41:59.168 --> 42:01.519
but the man
standing next to you.

42:04.304 --> 42:06.436
Now, I don't know who he is.

42:09.831 --> 42:11.180
But I know who he's not.

42:20.407 --> 42:21.800
Should I tell her or you?

42:29.155 --> 42:30.896
Finish him, bro.

42:31.070 --> 42:32.724
No!

42:32.898 --> 42:35.901
Dad! Dad, wake up.Aren't you something?

42:37.467 --> 42:38.599
Let me go!

42:40.732 --> 42:41.776
Come on.

42:42.908 --> 42:43.778
No, it's okay.

42:47.869 --> 42:49.697
Yeah, there you go.

42:49.871 --> 42:52.091
There you go.

42:52.265 --> 42:54.484
You really don't remember me,
do you?

42:55.921 --> 42:57.575
Maybe this will help.

43:08.281 --> 43:09.412
See?

43:14.330 --> 43:15.549
What...?

43:18.465 --> 43:21.250
Years ago, there was
a fire in our house.

43:21.424 --> 43:23.513
Cops blamed me.

43:23.688 --> 43:24.993
I spent eight years in prison,

43:25.167 --> 43:26.995
wondering if
I'd ever see you again.

43:31.173 --> 43:33.219
I didn't even know
if you were dead or alive.

43:38.398 --> 43:41.009
This creep here must have...

43:41.183 --> 43:43.011
found you
and kept you for himself.

43:44.796 --> 43:46.624
REPORTER
Up next in local news,

43:46.798 --> 43:49.757
a meth lab caught fire
in west Detroit this morning.

43:49.931 --> 43:52.542
Police were able
to arrest the primary suspect.

43:52.717 --> 43:55.545
The man was taken into custody
and could face charges

43:55.720 --> 43:57.460
for a large number of crimes
committed

43:57.635 --> 44:00.072
over the past several years.You have no idea

44:00.246 --> 44:02.770
how much I've been waiting
for this moment.

44:18.177 --> 44:19.613
Did he hurt you?

44:22.007 --> 44:23.486
But he did steal you
away from me,

44:23.661 --> 44:25.575
and now he must die,
you understand?

44:27.752 --> 44:29.318
Kill him.

44:29.492 --> 44:31.451
No.Fuck are you doing?

44:31.625 --> 44:34.106
Not in front of my kid.
Do it outside.

44:39.851 --> 44:42.418
Wake up, you blind fuck.

44:43.811 --> 44:46.684
Oh! Fuck!

45:09.097 --> 45:10.490
Fucking coward.

45:17.453 --> 45:19.891
Take her to the truck
while I hunt this motherfucker.

45:20.065 --> 45:21.719
Let's go.

45:27.420 --> 45:29.988
Let me go!What's wrong with you?

45:30.162 --> 45:31.380
Fucking wanna go home?

45:57.798 --> 45:59.278
I don't care who you are.

45:59.452 --> 46:02.107
I'm gonna teach you
some fucking manners, yo.

46:02.281 --> 46:05.197
You ungrateful, little bitch.

46:23.041 --> 46:24.303
No.

46:32.398 --> 46:34.139
Stop.

46:34.313 --> 46:36.097
Please!

46:36.271 --> 46:37.882
Stop!

46:53.114 --> 46:54.594
Move. Go, go.

46:54.768 --> 46:56.814
Move. Now.

47:24.667 --> 47:26.278
Move!

47:38.681 --> 47:40.161
I'm sorry, man.

47:43.382 --> 47:44.905
He's back in the house.I know.

47:45.079 --> 47:46.994
He wants us to follow him.

47:49.388 --> 47:51.303
Enough of these silly games.

48:08.842 --> 48:10.278
JIM-
It's his jacket.

48:12.411 --> 48:13.542
Attaboy.

48:13.716 --> 48:14.630
Attaboy.

48:16.676 --> 48:17.590
Wait.

48:17.764 --> 48:18.939
Stop.

48:21.289 --> 48:22.508
Is it true?

48:22.682 --> 48:23.726
Move.

48:23.901 --> 48:25.337
What's my real name?

48:25.511 --> 48:26.642
Get over here now!

48:26.816 --> 48:28.122
When's my birthday?

48:28.296 --> 48:30.124
My real one?Stop it!

48:30.298 --> 48:31.560
No, you stop it!

48:41.266 --> 48:42.963
Go!

49:51.336 --> 49:52.380
Hey.

51:12.417 --> 51:14.071
Phoenix!

51:14.245 --> 51:16.943
Calm down, girl.

51:19.424 --> 51:20.642
Calm down.

51:40.967 --> 51:42.099
Stay.

51:57.636 --> 51:59.116
Put her in the truck.

52:22.704 --> 52:24.141
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

52:26.360 --> 52:28.275
What are you doing?

52:28.449 --> 52:30.843
Your dog's in there.Dog's dead.

52:31.017 --> 52:32.540
You don't know that.

52:32.714 --> 52:34.542
You wanna go and find out?

53:31.599 --> 53:32.948
No!

56:28.036 --> 56:29.777
Good morning, princess.

56:38.177 --> 56:39.483
How you feeling?

56:44.575 --> 56:45.706
You all right?

56:47.708 --> 56:49.101
Wanna sit with me?

56:50.885 --> 56:52.713
Come, sit with me. Come on.

56:54.062 --> 56:55.934
Yeah.

56:56.108 --> 56:57.588
There you go.

56:57.762 --> 56:58.763
There you go.

56:59.938 --> 57:01.200
Yeah.

57:07.641 --> 57:08.903
Door's open.

57:10.339 --> 57:11.906
Not a prisoner anymore.

57:13.647 --> 57:16.302
You mean, I can go?

57:18.086 --> 57:19.348
If you want.

57:21.394 --> 57:23.091
Or you can stay here

57:23.265 --> 57:25.093
and find out
who you really are.

57:33.580 --> 57:35.843
Do I have
any brothers or sisters?

57:38.237 --> 57:40.065
Unfortunately, no.

57:42.502 --> 57:44.330
When's my birthday?

57:44.504 --> 57:45.897
February 20th.

57:48.290 --> 57:50.075
What was my mother's name?

57:52.251 --> 57:53.513
Josephine.

57:54.906 --> 57:56.342
Do I look like her?

57:59.954 --> 58:00.955
Yeah.

58:03.610 --> 58:04.916
You do.

58:07.353 --> 58:08.485
Tara.

58:09.747 --> 58:11.183
That's your real name.

58:13.011 --> 58:14.099
Tara.

58:15.970 --> 58:17.929
Everything that man
told you is a lie.

58:19.321 --> 58:20.714
What happened to him?

58:22.237 --> 58:23.543
He got what he deserved.

58:25.806 --> 58:28.722
Hey. I'm not sorry.

58:28.896 --> 58:30.768
You shouldn't be either.

58:30.942 --> 58:32.160
I wanna go.

58:33.510 --> 58:35.294
Where? Where you gonna go?

58:35.468 --> 58:37.514
There's a shelter I know.

58:39.037 --> 58:40.560
Like I said,

58:40.734 --> 58:42.519
you're not a prisoner anymore.

01:01:16.716 --> 01:01:18.022
Mom?

01:01:20.198 --> 01:01:21.286
Like I said...

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:24.289
everything he told you
was a lie.

01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:38.346
My Tara?

01:01:43.438 --> 01:01:44.875
You...

01:01:45.049 --> 01:01:47.660
got so big, heh.

01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:53.187
Can I hug you?

01:01:59.454 --> 01:02:00.760
Come here.

01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:03.937
Oh, God.

01:02:05.983 --> 01:02:07.549
Oh, God.

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.772
Mmm. Oh, God.

01:02:14.556 --> 01:02:16.733
Oh, baby, we missed you so much.

01:02:22.173 --> 01:02:24.131
Mmm...

01:02:24.305 --> 01:02:25.567
There you are.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:30.834
You were
such a beautiful baby.

01:02:40.408 --> 01:02:41.932
Get it out.

01:02:42.106 --> 01:02:44.456
Get it out. Come on.

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:47.720
There you go.
There you go. There you go.

01:02:47.894 --> 01:02:49.983
Sorry.Nothing to apologize for.

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:54.031
Are you okay?

01:02:57.164 --> 01:03:00.646
The same fire
that destroyed our family...

01:03:02.474 --> 01:03:05.303
it burned up my insides.

01:03:09.873 --> 01:03:12.789
Mom and Dad used to have a...

01:03:16.053 --> 01:03:18.620
kitchen, heh...

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.709
in the basement of our house,

01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:23.800
where we used to cook.

01:03:27.716 --> 01:03:29.893
It was for our business.

01:03:34.245 --> 01:03:35.724
Are you thirsty?

01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:51.610
Tara?

01:03:53.481 --> 01:03:54.787
I'm dying.

01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:56.049
What?

01:03:57.616 --> 01:04:00.793
The smoke from the chemicals...

01:04:00.967 --> 01:04:04.579
poisoned my blood
and badly damaged my heart.

01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:07.539
I don't think
I have much time left.

01:04:07.713 --> 01:04:09.497
Is there anything you can do?

01:04:19.159 --> 01:04:22.597
I heard you left flowers for me
at our old house.

01:04:26.123 --> 01:04:27.341
Is that true?

01:04:30.388 --> 01:04:32.042
Oh.

01:04:33.652 --> 01:04:34.740
Weren't you wishing

01:04:34.914 --> 01:04:39.745
your mama
was healthy and alive?

01:04:39.919 --> 01:04:41.138
Yes.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.588
I need a new heart, baby.

01:04:57.719 --> 01:04:59.896
But not just any heart.

01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:03.421
Doctor said
it has to be a, uh...

01:05:03.595 --> 01:05:05.510
It must be a...

01:05:07.077 --> 01:05:08.774
compatible donor.

01:05:12.996 --> 01:05:15.085
Like a direct relative.

01:05:17.783 --> 01:05:20.612
You hold the gift
that can save your mama's life.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:27.749
And, baby, I need that gift.

01:05:46.812 --> 01:05:49.858
We'll finally
be together as one.

01:05:51.817 --> 01:05:56.648
You'll live on in me.

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:26.504
Go home.

01:08:20.008 --> 01:08:22.010
Go away.

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:24.229
I said, go.

01:08:32.456 --> 01:08:33.500
Stay.

01:08:36.676 --> 01:08:37.939
Stay.

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:11.408
Go home.

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:21.505
Go home.

01:10:02.807 --> 01:10:03.982
I hope you understand

01:10:04.156 --> 01:10:06.202
the high risks
of this procedure.

01:10:07.725 --> 01:10:09.205
I think I pay you enough.

01:10:09.379 --> 01:10:11.250
Shut up and do your job.

01:10:12.773 --> 01:10:14.471
Why is she still alive?

01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:18.214
If she's dead, so is her heart.

01:10:19.737 --> 01:10:21.565
And I can't keep it fresh
long enough

01:10:21.739 --> 01:10:24.829
without the proper equipment.

01:10:25.003 --> 01:10:27.919
I have to cut it out of her
while she's still breathing.

01:10:30.051 --> 01:10:31.662
JOSEPHINE
Hey.

01:10:31.836 --> 01:10:33.272
Hey, hey, hey.

01:10:33.446 --> 01:10:35.231
Hey, hey.

01:10:38.495 --> 01:10:39.887
Thank you.

01:11:00.343 --> 01:11:02.301
JIM-
What's wrong with you, man?

01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:05.826
What they're doing
in there is wrong.

01:11:07.698 --> 01:11:09.090
She's our cook.

01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:13.530
If she dies,
there's no product.

01:11:13.704 --> 01:11:16.010
If there's no product,
there's no us.

01:11:18.578 --> 01:11:19.666
¿Comprende?

01:11:22.016 --> 01:11:23.714
Still fucking wrong.

01:11:31.852 --> 01:11:32.897
Hey.

01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:36.683
You ready?
Mm-hm.

01:11:39.425 --> 01:11:40.644
Let's go.

01:12:04.668 --> 01:12:05.843
What the fuck?

01:12:11.762 --> 01:12:13.329
Go check it out.

01:12:25.036 --> 01:12:26.080
Hm.

01:13:30.754 --> 01:13:32.582
You killed my brother!

01:13:34.105 --> 01:13:36.020
You blind freak!

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:02.307
I'm gonna carve your fucking
head open like a pumpkin, man.

01:14:58.537 --> 01:15:00.583
This is for Shadow.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.673
Oh, fuck.

01:15:03.847 --> 01:15:05.065
No!

01:15:11.942 --> 01:15:13.291
It's him.

01:15:18.426 --> 01:15:20.820
How the hell did he find...?

01:15:39.578 --> 01:15:41.493
Disloyal fucking animal.

01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:43.539
Is everything okay?

01:15:45.279 --> 01:15:47.499
Yeah, everything's okay.

01:15:47.673 --> 01:15:50.546
Everything's okay, I promise.Baby, should I be worried?

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.286
No, no. Not at all.

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:53.810
I got you. I got you.

01:15:53.984 --> 01:15:56.464
I can't work without power.

01:15:56.639 --> 01:15:57.683
Uh...

01:15:58.684 --> 01:16:01.208
Change of plans, then.

01:16:01.382 --> 01:16:03.167
Pack your things.
Bring the girl.

01:16:03.341 --> 01:16:04.560
Raul.

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:07.780
Bring the men.
Kill the blind man.

01:16:07.954 --> 01:16:11.567
How many of us?
All of you!

01:16:14.526 --> 01:16:15.614
Let's go.

01:17:48.794 --> 01:17:50.491
They're gonna kill her.

01:17:55.105 --> 01:17:56.672
And that's not cool with me.

01:18:00.545 --> 01:18:01.720
They're leaving now.

01:18:01.894 --> 01:18:03.026
The ladder behind you

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.680
leads directly to them.

01:18:04.854 --> 01:18:06.464
You'd better hurry.

01:18:20.478 --> 01:18:21.914
Go left.

01:18:23.089 --> 01:18:24.308
That way.

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:29.226
He'll kill you all.

01:18:38.975 --> 01:18:39.932
Fuck it. I'm out.

01:18:40.106 --> 01:18:42.326
Hey, hey! Hey!

01:19:07.568 --> 01:19:09.527
Good morning, motherfucker.

01:19:13.923 --> 01:19:16.577
JOSEPHINE Baby.Shh, shh. It's okay.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:18.884
Stop it.

01:19:51.656 --> 01:19:52.875
Baby?

01:19:54.441 --> 01:19:55.616
Hello?

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.270
I can't see you.

01:20:06.758 --> 01:20:07.933
Baby?

01:20:40.661 --> 01:20:42.663
I'm over here! Where are you?

01:20:43.969 --> 01:20:45.275
Baby?

01:21:09.081 --> 01:21:11.040
I got you, motherfucker.

01:21:22.442 --> 01:21:23.704
No.

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:27.186
No! No!

01:21:35.325 --> 01:21:36.152
No.

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:39.677
No!

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:33.078
Phoenix!

01:23:06.546 --> 01:23:08.244
Now...

01:23:08.418 --> 01:23:10.289
you're gonna see

01:23:10.463 --> 01:23:12.291
what I see.

01:24:02.472 --> 01:24:03.951
Phoenix?

01:24:14.527 --> 01:24:16.138
Stop.

01:24:16.312 --> 01:24:17.922
Oh, stop!

01:24:21.012 --> 01:24:22.361
You...

01:24:24.755 --> 01:24:26.931
You mustn't come near me.

01:24:33.024 --> 01:24:36.984
Everything he said...

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:41.293
is true.

01:24:47.995 --> 01:24:50.302
I am no father.

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:57.353
I have killed.

01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:04.099
I...

01:25:05.143 --> 01:25:06.710
have raped.

01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:09.060
I...

01:25:12.455 --> 01:25:13.934
am nothing.

01:25:19.679 --> 01:25:20.898
Nothing...

01:25:22.943 --> 01:25:24.597
but a monster.

01:25:30.777 --> 01:25:32.431
And you...

01:25:32.605 --> 01:25:34.651
cannot be around me.

01:25:36.522 --> 01:25:37.480
Ever.

01:25:39.786 --> 01:25:40.700
So go.

01:25:44.313 --> 01:25:45.705
Now. Go.

01:25:47.054 --> 01:25:48.230
Go!

01:26:20.218 --> 01:26:22.307
Oh, God.

01:27:12.096 --> 01:27:13.010
Tara?

01:27:37.208 --> 01:27:38.862
No.

01:27:40.777 --> 01:27:43.345
No. No.

01:27:47.827 --> 01:27:48.698
Please.

01:27:54.051 --> 01:27:55.792
No, no, no.

01:27:57.533 --> 01:27:58.882
Let me help you.

01:28:00.753 --> 01:28:02.277
I can save you.

01:28:08.108 --> 01:28:10.023
You already have.

01:29:55.128 --> 01:29:56.521
Hey.

01:29:58.262 --> 01:29:59.306
Hey.

01:30:00.699 --> 01:30:02.527
Think there's room for one more?

01:30:04.181 --> 01:30:05.182
I'm sure there is.

01:30:07.271 --> 01:30:08.620
What's your name?

01:30:13.103 --> 01:30:14.713
My name is Phoenix.
