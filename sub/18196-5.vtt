00:01.760 --> 00:03.477
I am pregnant.

00:03.560 --> 00:04.913
Pregnant?

00:05.000 --> 00:07.639
I know. I know. I can't believe it either.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.439
Ramona, Rachel's pregnant!

00:10.520 --> 00:11.430
Pregnant?

00:15.400 --> 00:17.994
And because I quit my job I've got no money

00:18.080 --> 00:19.559
so I couldn't pay my rent.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.278
Now my landlord's kicked me out.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.998
I called but you were engaged.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.071
Can I stay here for a while?

00:25.160 --> 00:26.878
I'm pregnant.

00:26.960 --> 00:27.949
Pregnant?

00:28.040 --> 00:30.349
I know! We couldn't believe it either!

00:30.440 --> 00:32.396
Right. Well...

00:32.479 --> 00:35.040
I think that's everything.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.633
Thanks for having me, Peter.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.631
I really do appreciate it.
- David...

00:38.720 --> 00:40.153
Rachel's pregnant.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.549
Pregnant?

00:46.600 --> 00:49.114
Don't forget to pay the window cleaner.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.078
And the help. She only did two hours
this week.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.550
Shall I write it down?
- David, will you just go, please?

00:58.840 --> 01:00.910
Thanks again, Pete.
I really do...

01:01.000 --> 01:02.956
David...

01:04.640 --> 01:05.595
Bye.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.396
Could I stay here for a while?

01:13.480 --> 01:15.436
Ordinarily it'd be no problem,

01:15.520 --> 01:17.476
but David's moving back today.

01:17.560 --> 01:20.916
We need a little time to get things
sorted out.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.310
Hi.
- Daddy! Daddy!

01:28.400 --> 01:30.709
Hello, Joshy, you big shrimp!

01:30.800 --> 01:32.756
Happy?
- Hello!

01:46.360 --> 01:48.749
<i>Throw-in. A bit more pressure this time.</i>

01:48.840 --> 01:53.595
<i>That bit of passion from United has created
a chance for them. We want more of that.</i>

01:53.680 --> 01:56.990
<i>The players have to show some character now,
some spirit.</i>

01:57.080 --> 01:58.798
<i>They know.</i>

02:00.360 --> 02:02.316
Aaaaaaaaargh!

02:05.120 --> 02:09.238
Hello. We've got a really big favour
to ask you.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.555
I thought you were getting heavier.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.596
You didn't say anything.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.636
I'm learning, mate.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.676
Oh, there's one thing...

02:23.760 --> 02:25.716
Yes?
- About Laura.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.076
It doesn't change the way we feel about her,
does it?

02:29.160 --> 02:31.435
I already think of her as my daughter.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.590
I've been running through my mind

02:33.680 --> 02:37.309
the speech I'll give her first boyfriend.
And the hiding.

02:37.400 --> 02:40.198
The rows we'll have
when I teach her how to drive.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.714
How I'll miss her when she leaves home.

02:42.800 --> 02:46.190
No.2 will be around then to soften the blow.
- Aye.

02:48.520 --> 02:51.990
You don't think...the age gap will be
a problem, do you?

02:52.080 --> 02:54.036
Not at all.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.157
Couple of years, Laura will be
able to baby-sit.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.196
True.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.838
Hmm.
- Hmm.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.319
The spare-room lamp is bust.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.152
I'll just take er...

03:08.240 --> 03:10.196
my one.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.476
Oh, it's good to be home.

03:19.560 --> 03:23.473
The children are glad you're back, as well.
Josh particularly.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.630
That's a lovely picture he did me.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.438
What was it of?

03:27.520 --> 03:30.478
You, David.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.710
Putting the dragon to the sword.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.718
I'm going to be such a
disappointment to him.

03:57.440 --> 04:00.034
Oh, yes, it's good to be home.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.316
Better be getting back to bed.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.956
Oh, it's so nice.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.078
Oh, yes...

04:31.000 --> 04:31.955
Hi.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.554
Well, hello. Is Pete in?

04:34.640 --> 04:37.279
He's still in bed.
Want me to give him a kick?

04:37.360 --> 04:40.318
Er...no, no. He's probably...

04:40.400 --> 04:42.356
shagged.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.874
I'll call back when he's less busy.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.758
I'm coming! I'm coming!
- Hang on. He's coming now.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.796
Hiya.
- Hi.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.836
Hey, is it OK if I have a shower?

04:51.920 --> 04:53.876
Be my guest.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.916
Oh! I forget! You are!

04:59.920 --> 05:03.071
Who is she?
- Come in and I'll tell you.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.990
Yesterday evening. At a loose end.
Went for a drink. Celebrate.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.275
Rachel's pregnancy?
- David's departure.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.191
So, anyway...

05:16.280 --> 05:19.716
I'm at the bar, tossing up
between a curry and a Chinese,

05:19.800 --> 05:21.950
when suddenly...

05:26.200 --> 05:29.158
Oh, my God... Oh, I'm so sorry!

05:29.240 --> 05:31.231
I thought you were someone else!

05:32.600 --> 05:34.352
Who?
- Her brother.

05:34.440 --> 05:35.475
Anyway...

05:35.560 --> 05:38.120
once we've cleared up that misunderstanding,

05:38.200 --> 05:40.350
I buy her a drink, and we get talking.

05:40.440 --> 05:44.558
Then it's back here and it's
''Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.''

05:44.640 --> 05:46.437
O-o-o-oh...yes.

05:46.520 --> 05:49.717
I can't believe it.
She's only bleeding gorgeous!

05:49.800 --> 05:51.756
She is bleeding...gorgeous.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.796
Jeez, you're a jammy bastard.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.631
Hi!
- Hope you don't mind. I found this.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.358
I haven't unpacked yet.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.351
Unpacked?

06:00.440 --> 06:02.476
Oh. Adam. Er...married to Rachel.

06:02.560 --> 06:03.993
Ah. Adam.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.071
Congratulations. I heard your news.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.277
Pete's been talking about me?
- No, no. Rachel told me.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.635
Jo! Oh, right, yeah.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.359
So you heard about my drama.

06:14.440 --> 06:17.671
I needed somewhere to stay
so Karen put me on to Pete.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.716
So you two haven't had sex?

06:28.920 --> 06:30.876
I'm fine, thanks.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.916
God almighty.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.037
These things were bad enough
when I was half-cut.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.076
Now they're deadly.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.116
Do you want to leave?
- Yes, I do.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.590
But we'd better give it
at least another five minutes.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.511
There's Henry Maguire.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.034
I'm hoping he might put a bit of
work my way.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.594
Erm...will you be all right on your own?

06:52.680 --> 06:54.636
Yeah, fine.
- I won't be long.

06:55.920 --> 06:58.195
Henry...

07:21.680 --> 07:25.150
You know it's illegal to stand on your own
at a party like this?

07:25.240 --> 07:27.196
I'm sorry?

07:27.280 --> 07:29.475
Technically, you should be mixing.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.516
Making polite conversation

07:31.600 --> 07:34.910
with people you've never met before
and won't meet again,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.310
and whose opinion
you don't give a damn about anyway.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.994
Oh, right. Is that what you're doing now?

07:41.080 --> 07:43.196
No, you see, I'm working er...

07:43.280 --> 07:47.751
deep undercover for the party police.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.957
If people are too dull
I simply show them the door.

07:51.040 --> 07:53.395
Haven't got very far, then, have you?

07:53.480 --> 07:55.436
No.

07:55.520 --> 07:57.476
So, have I passed?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.516
Oh, yeah. Just about.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.556
Thanks.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.518
Can I get you a drink?
- No, thanks. I'm driving.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.556
So am I.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.637
That must make us the dullest people here,
then.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.596
OK... So we want...

08:20.680 --> 08:23.558
Can I have a strawberry milkshake as well?
- Of course.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.596
Do you want a small or a large?

08:27.440 --> 08:29.396
Stupid question. Very sorry.

08:29.480 --> 08:32.313
You know they make them from potato peel?
- They don't.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.836
They do. That's why it smells of poo.
No, they do.

08:35.919 --> 08:39.629
They mash up all the bits of potato
they don't use in the chips,

08:39.720 --> 08:41.597
get some old horrible milk

08:41.679 --> 08:43.875
with bits in it, throw that in,

08:43.960 --> 08:46.030
and bingo - milkshake. Gorgeous.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.076
He's making it up! Go and get a seat!

08:48.160 --> 08:49.878
I'll do this.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.110
I'll have to get used to eating here.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.235
Believe me!

08:56.720 --> 08:58.676
She is a lovely girl.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.159
She is.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.959
So how long have you been fostering?
- Twelve years.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.635
Ten children. Not all at the same time.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.393
Isn't it hard giving them up?

09:09.480 --> 09:10.913
Always.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.673
If you don't mind me asking...
- Why do I do it?

09:13.760 --> 09:15.830
Why do you do it?
- Well, someone has to.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.876
Besides, I get a lot out of it.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.155
I mean, take Laura.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.198
When she came to me a year ago,
she was in a dreadful state.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.157
Didn't want anyone touching her.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.231
Wouldn't look you in the eye.

09:27.320 --> 09:32.872
She was all the time on at me, ''When
are we eating?'' even if we'd just ate.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.109
Why?

09:34.200 --> 09:37.749
She'd never known where her next
meal was coming from. Literally.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.718
Oh, God...
- It's wonderful to see the change in her.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.756
Hello.

09:42.840 --> 09:46.071
Look what I got.
- Agh! Ooh! Er! What is it?

09:46.160 --> 09:48.754
I don't know.
- Nor do I. It's cool, though.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.354
Jean, can we see their house after this?

09:51.440 --> 09:53.510
Well, I don't know. I...

09:53.600 --> 09:56.512
It's only round the corner.
Rachel said I can see my room.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.158
If that's all right.

09:58.240 --> 10:01.152
Er... Yes.
- OK.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.156
Here we are.

10:04.240 --> 10:07.312
Tell me...do you work?

10:07.400 --> 10:09.231
Yeah, I'm a brain surgeon.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.514
Really?

10:10.600 --> 10:13.558
No. Just sounds more impressive
than ''housewife''.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.915
There's nothing wrong in being a housewife.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.992
Yeah, I know that.
It's just, in this day and age,

10:19.080 --> 10:23.312
a housewife has the same social status
as the long-term unemployed.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.868
Hm.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.952
So what do you do?
- I'm a househusband.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.075
Really?

10:30.160 --> 10:33.357
No. It just sounds more impressive
than ''publisher''.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.352
In a previous life I used to be
in publishing.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.668
What did you do?

10:37.760 --> 10:39.990
I was an editor.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.957
Well, if we weren't already talking,

10:42.040 --> 10:44.315
someone really should introduce us.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.072
What sort of stuff do you publish?

10:47.600 --> 10:49.556
Well, lifestyle, mostly.

10:49.640 --> 10:53.269
In fact, we're doing one at the moment
on the modern woman.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.318
How she can have it all - job, family,
the works.

10:56.400 --> 11:00.029
Hmm. And what about the pressures
to have it all?

11:01.080 --> 11:03.196
I...don't understand.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.999
Whether we're wearing pinafores
or power suits,

11:06.080 --> 11:08.640
we're still all imprisoned by stereotypes.

11:08.720 --> 11:13.032
The truly liberated woman
is the woman who does what she wants.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.873
How come that's not in my book?

11:15.960 --> 11:18.872
Because you don't have a decent editor?

11:24.040 --> 11:25.996
Well, the job is yours.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.116
I already have a job.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.475
Oh, yes, you do, don't you?

11:30.560 --> 11:32.755
Well, fair enough.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.718
But maybe you'd do me a favour
and consider...

11:35.800 --> 11:37.756
reading it,

11:37.840 --> 11:39.990
and letting me know what you think.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.799
You know, as a woman...

11:42.880 --> 11:44.836
in your position.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.352
OK.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.117
Shit.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.998
Hey, hey, no, it's all right. Don't worry.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.036
Look...
- I'm hopeless.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.554
It's nothing, look. It's only a plate.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.596
No, I mean my life.

12:10.680 --> 12:14.389
Just as I was starting to get settled here,
making friends,

12:14.480 --> 12:16.436
everything goes wrong.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.358
Look, it can't be that bad.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.396
I've split up with a guy,

12:22.480 --> 12:24.311
I've got no job,

12:24.400 --> 12:26.311
I'm broke, and I'm homeless.

12:27.400 --> 12:30.119
Well, when you put it like that...
- How else can you put it?

12:30.200 --> 12:31.838
OK. Erm...

12:31.920 --> 12:33.876
You're young, free and single.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.436
It's summer, so who wants to work anyway?

12:38.280 --> 12:40.236
Money's the root of all evil...

12:40.320 --> 12:43.835
And how about this one?
Erm...you can stay here.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.910
Oh, and my period started, as well.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.991
I can't work miracles.

12:50.080 --> 12:53.595
Anyway, thanks for trying to cheer me up.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.636
Thanks for letting me stay.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.678
I don't know where I'd be without
you right now.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.716
Big issue?
- Yeah, probably!

13:02.800 --> 13:04.756
Oh, come here. Don't worry.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.796
God, I must look like shit.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.836
Excuse me.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.792
You look all right to me.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.676
<i>This...would be your room.</i>

13:17.760 --> 13:19.159
Oh, wow, it's huge!

13:19.240 --> 13:21.037
We can paint it a different colour.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.076
Pink!
- Er...

13:23.160 --> 13:26.311
It could do with an undercoat. But why not?
- Do you like it?

13:26.400 --> 13:29.039
It's brilliant! Can I try the bed?

13:29.120 --> 13:31.031
Yes, of course you can!

13:31.520 --> 13:33.476
Is that a phone point?

13:33.560 --> 13:35.630
Er...yes.
- Wrong answer.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.756
Yeah, I'm in my room.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.638
Listen, is your mum
still being a bit eggy about Friday?

13:40.720 --> 13:42.870
Eggy?

13:42.960 --> 13:44.916
Great! Lovely!

13:45.720 --> 13:48.518
Pete, do you think everything's defrosted?

13:48.600 --> 13:51.194
Oh, yeah. The heat'll kill any bacteria.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.033
Well, I'll do something useful
and prick these.

13:54.120 --> 13:58.159
You often hear of women getting pregnant
when they've given up hope of conceiving.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.310
Yeah, but when doctors have said they can't?

14:01.680 --> 14:04.752
In the Catholic church such miracles happen.
- True.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.315
So, how far gone are you?
- Four months.

14:08.400 --> 14:11.312
Four?! But what about your periods?

14:11.400 --> 14:13.550
I just put it down to the stress
of the adoption.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.914
You want to fan that. Get the heat going.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.956
I know what I'm doing!

14:20.040 --> 14:22.076
I love the summer! Women wear so little.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.628
Yeah, Karen looks very tasty.
- Aha!

14:24.720 --> 14:26.199
Yeah.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.271
Still?

14:29.320 --> 14:31.311
I thought you two were back on.

14:31.400 --> 14:35.075
We are, but...we weren't exactly having sex
before I moved out.

14:35.160 --> 14:38.948
She was pissed off with you then.
- It doesn't seem to be on the agenda any more.

14:39.040 --> 14:42.396
Get that back, mate. You don't want
your love life confined to the bathroom.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.675
I'll go and get some more beers.

14:47.440 --> 14:51.319
Before I kicked him out
I couldn't bear for him to touch me. Now...

14:51.400 --> 14:53.516
it's not like I find him abhorrent.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.431
But...

14:55.520 --> 14:57.670
I don't know what I feel, really.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.274
You've got to fancy him again, that's all.
- I know.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.191
I just don't know how to.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.674
Look, I know what I'm doing, all right?

15:05.760 --> 15:07.716
OK. No need to get eggy.
- Eggy?

15:07.800 --> 15:10.598
I didn't know you were into self-help books.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.671
It's not mine. I bought it for Jo.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.911
The Crumbling Cookie -
How to Have Your Cake And Eat It.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.276
What a load of bollocks.
- Oi! Don't knock what you don't know.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.112
<i>Oh, my God! You fancy her!</i>

15:21.200 --> 15:23.156
Who?
- Judith Chalmers! Jo!

15:23.240 --> 15:25.435
No, I don't!
- It all makes sense now.

15:25.520 --> 15:29.069
The barbie, the presents,
the oh-too-vehement denial.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.833
You want to be her boyfriend!

15:31.920 --> 15:34.957
Just piss off, all right?
- So is the book any good?

15:35.040 --> 15:37.110
He thinks I don't take it seriously enough.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.156
I didn't say that.

15:39.240 --> 15:42.437
He sets me little exercises.
- Does he, indeed? Right!

15:43.120 --> 15:45.076
Make two columns.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.116
Your strengths...

15:47.200 --> 15:49.156
and weaknesses.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.196
Oh, God, that'll be one-sided.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.794
Come on, you must have some weaknesses.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.836
OK...er...

15:55.920 --> 15:57.911
Skills! What about your skills?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.956
Skills?

16:00.040 --> 16:02.031
You know - typing, shorthand...

16:02.120 --> 16:04.076
Languages?

16:04.160 --> 16:06.151
Australian English? Maybe not.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.196
Oh, no, hang on. I know.

16:08.280 --> 16:10.555
This shoulder dislocates sometimes,

16:10.640 --> 16:13.234
but I can pop it back into its socket.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.799
Isn't that more of a weakness?

16:14.880 --> 16:16.950
I tend to put it into both columns.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.996
Which shoulder? This one here?

16:19.080 --> 16:21.071
Can you feel it crack?
- Wow! Yeah!

16:21.160 --> 16:23.071
Aren't you minding them sausages?

16:23.160 --> 16:26.436
Aren't you in advertising any more?
- I had a better idea. Well, Pete did.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.873
Personal trainer.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.633
I qualified in Oz
and there's a big market for it here.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.754
I'm her first client.
I need to lose a couple of pounds.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.193
Personal trainer...

16:37.280 --> 16:39.953
I know I look great,
but I could get in better shape.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.758
No, you're fine!
- Yeah, sign me up.

16:41.840 --> 16:42.955
No! It's my idea!

16:45.440 --> 16:48.477
Maybe you could do it together.
- Put David down as well.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.551
No!
- Me?

16:50.640 --> 16:53.234
You could do with it. Put on a bit
of muscle. - Good idea.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.472
Great. Right, Pete!
- Yeah.

16:57.560 --> 17:01.109
It'll need a couple more coats
before I can paint it pink.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.191
But the meeting went well, yeah?

17:03.280 --> 17:04.792
Yeah.
- Terrific.

17:04.880 --> 17:07.394
She even asked if she could leave this here.
- Great!

17:07.480 --> 17:10.631
We're picking her up from school tomorrow.
- Looking forward to that.

17:10.720 --> 17:13.598
We said we'd take her shopping for
a new duvet.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.636
As long as it's not pink!

17:15.720 --> 17:19.269
Reports from her foster mother
are really positive as well.

17:19.359 --> 17:21.316
Great. Coffee!

17:24.319 --> 17:26.470
There is one thing we want to ask you.

17:26.560 --> 17:29.074
We haven't mentioned this to Laura yet.

17:29.160 --> 17:32.709
It's just really advice
as to when to broach the subject.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.678
You see, I'm...pregnant.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.119
Sorry?

17:38.200 --> 17:41.033
Not dissimilar to my reaction.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.076
But I thought you...couldn't.

17:43.160 --> 17:45.276
Well, that's what we thought, too.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.920
But...apparently, whilst unlikely,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.116
it's not so rare that it counts
as a miracle.

17:51.400 --> 17:55.234
The thing is, should we tell Laura
before or after she moves in?

17:55.320 --> 17:57.880
I'm sorry, I don't think it's
as simple as that.

17:57.960 --> 18:01.077
How do you mean?
- Well, this could change things.

18:01.160 --> 18:05.119
Why? We've talked it through.
We still want Laura.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.156
Yeah. Just as much as before.

18:07.240 --> 18:11.233
This isn't about you.
This is about what's best for Laura.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.276
Well, we are!

18:13.360 --> 18:15.316
I need to talk to my superiors.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.198
In the meantime,
I don't think you should see Laura.

18:18.280 --> 18:20.669
What?!
- We're picking her up from school tomorrow.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.478
No. We need to discuss this.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.993
What's to discuss?

18:24.080 --> 18:27.197
I'll see you tomorrow.
We'll talk about it then. OK?

18:35.400 --> 18:37.356
Is all this gear new, then?

18:37.440 --> 18:40.910
Yeah, pretty much.
These shoes are state-of-the-art.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.956
Bi-directional outsole lugs,

18:43.040 --> 18:44.996
posterior metatarsal strap,

18:45.080 --> 18:48.038
and the very latest in pod cushion
technology.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.076
What's all that about, then?

18:50.160 --> 18:53.277
I haven't a clue, but they were
bloody expensive.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.716
Adam's cutting it a bit fine.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.314
I gave him a call. He was in a right paddy.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.356
Forgive the pun.

19:01.440 --> 19:04.876
Says he can't make it.
- He's got no stamina.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.393
Yeah. Wuss!

19:09.080 --> 19:11.036
Have you done five minutes?

19:11.120 --> 19:13.793
Oh...er...at least.
- OK. Before we start,

19:13.880 --> 19:17.236
I want to ask each of you about your goals.
- David?

19:17.320 --> 19:21.677
Blimey. Erm...financial security,
perhaps a little place in France...

19:21.760 --> 19:23.716
No, I mean from doing this.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.598
Oh, right. - What do you hope to
achieve by getting fit?

19:26.680 --> 19:28.636
Er...

19:28.720 --> 19:30.676
Well...

19:32.800 --> 19:36.873
Oh, David! I love you so much!

19:36.960 --> 19:38.916
David?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.956
Um...better health...

19:41.040 --> 19:44.794
improved cardiovascular...whatnot,
that sort of thing.

19:44.880 --> 19:48.236
OK. I think I know what you mean.
What about you, Pete?

19:50.360 --> 19:52.112
Oh, Pete!

19:52.200 --> 19:54.077
Oh! You drive me wild!

19:54.160 --> 19:56.116
Take me. Take me now.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.596
Pete?

20:00.680 --> 20:03.638
Same as David, really. Yes.

20:03.720 --> 20:08.874
OK. We'll start off gently to begin with,
so I can get a sense of what you're capable of,

20:08.960 --> 20:10.916
then we'll take it up from there.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.878
Let's start with a gentle jog, then,
shall we? Follow me.

20:20.440 --> 20:23.318
Would you like a coffee?
- Yes, please. White, no sugar.

20:24.520 --> 20:27.830
Jill, two coffees, please.
White, no sugar. Thanks.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.638
So...

20:29.720 --> 20:32.154
You read it, then?
- Yep. Cover to cover.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.196
Not that it has any.

20:34.280 --> 20:35.633
And?

20:35.720 --> 20:39.269
Interesting. The author, Geraldine Pascoe...

20:39.360 --> 20:41.749
she makes some interesting points.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.114
Good.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.918
Trouble is, she makes them badly.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.069
Ah.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.993
Let's face it, Mark,
the woman can't write, can she?

20:49.080 --> 20:51.355
She's an academic by training.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.396
Well, that explains it, then.

20:53.480 --> 20:57.268
It's dull, dry, dreary. And the chapter on
parenting - you can tell she has no kids.

20:57.360 --> 21:00.511
Yeah, we...decided not to have any.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.113
Sorry?

21:02.200 --> 21:03.918
Geraldine Pascoe.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.672
She's my wife.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.079
No.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.434
Oh!

21:08.520 --> 21:11.159
Oh! I'm so sorry!

21:11.240 --> 21:12.958
No need. We're very happy, thanks.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.473
I had no idea.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.437
Because I didn't give you any.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.795
No. No, you didn't. That was not very fair.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.678
And would you have been as honest if I had?

21:22.760 --> 21:23.715
No.

21:23.800 --> 21:28.078
Look, Karen, you're really not telling me
anything I don't suspect already.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.072
As you know, I'm committed to this book.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.914
It would really help me if you
would take it on.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.116
You know, knock it into some shape.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.634
I don't know. How would your wife feel?

21:39.720 --> 21:41.551
Look, why don't you meet her?

21:41.640 --> 21:44.438
You and your husband
come round to ours for dinner.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.476
I'm sure you'd get on.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.516
In many ways,

21:48.600 --> 21:50.556
you and her are very similar.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.637
Oi! Mind my shoes!
- What did you take 'em off for?

21:58.720 --> 22:00.039
My feet are killing me!

22:00.120 --> 22:03.396
Are you feeling better now?
- No! I've just thrown up.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.994
150 bloody quid!
- Well, at least you looked good.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.672
Not when he was hobbling.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.113
75 quid a foot.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.589
Look, you said we'd take it easy at first.

22:11.680 --> 22:14.035
We did. Any easier, we'd have been walking.

22:14.120 --> 22:17.078
At least he wouldn't be throwing up
and I wouldn't be crippled.

22:17.160 --> 22:20.277
OK. Well, maybe we'd better
pack it in for now.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.588
Yes!
- Call it a day.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.193
Suits me.

22:23.280 --> 22:25.236
Who are you phoning?

22:25.320 --> 22:27.276
A cab. To take me home.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.555
Oh, drop us off on the way, will you?

22:35.400 --> 22:37.356
Sit down.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.476
Would you like some coffee?

22:42.560 --> 22:44.835
No, I'm fine, thanks.

22:48.120 --> 22:51.396
I'm sorry.
We can't allow the adoption to continue.

22:51.480 --> 22:54.517
Oh, for God's sake!
- It wouldn't be fair on Laura.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.319
What, and this is?
She already sees us as her parents!

22:57.400 --> 23:00.517
In less than six months
you'll have a child of your own.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.431
Think how that'll make her feel.

23:02.520 --> 23:06.149
We'll make her feel wanted, loved,
part of a stable family.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.959
All the things we said we'd do
when we were approved to adopt.

23:09.040 --> 23:11.873
I'm sorry. This is a far from easy decision.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.235
It seems far too bloody easy to me!
- Adam...

23:14.320 --> 23:17.710
Rather than rock the boat,
just call the whole thing off.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.189
It's precisely because of Laura's future...

23:20.280 --> 23:21.429
Bollocks!

23:21.520 --> 23:23.397
Think of the damage
if the adoption breaks down.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.233
It won't break down!
- You can't know that for sure!

23:26.320 --> 23:28.470
We'll do everything we can to make it work.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.516
I don't doubt that...

23:30.600 --> 23:32.556
of either of you.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.074
But with the greatest will in the world,

23:35.160 --> 23:37.116
it's too big a risk.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.270
Does Laura know about this?

23:39.360 --> 23:40.634
Not yet, no.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.518
Why does she think
we didn't pick her up from school?

23:43.600 --> 23:48.310
We told her you couldn't make it.
- Oh! Great! Make us look like we don't care!

23:48.400 --> 23:51.198
I'm not trying to make it look
like anything!

23:58.080 --> 23:59.991
What happens next?

24:00.080 --> 24:01.911
It'll go back to panel.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.879
But they're likely
to accept our recommendation.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.236
Well, we will fight you.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.110
Bloody social workers playing God!

24:48.200 --> 24:50.077
We can't be trusted with a child?

24:50.160 --> 24:53.550
They shouldn't be trusted with a decision!
Screwing lives up!

24:53.640 --> 24:56.234
No wonder they've got such a bad reputation!

24:56.320 --> 24:58.276
Hey! Hey, hey, hey...

24:58.360 --> 25:00.237
Rach... Rach...

25:00.320 --> 25:02.311
We're not going to give Laura up.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.152
This isn't over, OK?

25:05.880 --> 25:07.836
Come on...darling...

25:07.920 --> 25:09.672
OK?

25:11.880 --> 25:13.836
Oh, you look great.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.876
Come on, we'll be late.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.796
David, come on.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.756
Ah...

25:28.800 --> 25:30.756
Agh! Ohh...
- Are you all right?

25:30.880 --> 25:33.553
I'll have to sue the makers of those shoes.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.596
And your friend Jo.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.356
Hi. Nice to see you.
- Hello.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.830
Thanks for coming. Please go in.
Hello, David. Hello.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.876
Are you all right?
- Yeah.

25:47.520 --> 25:48.999
Hi.
- Hey.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.354
What are you doing?

25:50.440 --> 25:52.590
Adding motivational skills to my weaknesses.

25:52.680 --> 25:55.877
Oh, come on! It wasn't that bad.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.872
No, I guess a cab firm benefited.

25:58.960 --> 26:02.077
Look, you can't blame yourself
for David's feet.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.833
And I probably wouldn't have thrown up...

26:04.920 --> 26:06.876
if I hadn't had those crisps.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.474
Excuse me? What crisps?

26:09.560 --> 26:11.755
Prawn cocktail. Oh...

26:11.840 --> 26:14.513
Pete...
- I'm sorry. I was hungry.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.036
Maybe you could give me dietary advice.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.917
Don't eat crisps before a run.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.994
Oh, and try to cut down on the beer, huh?

26:28.520 --> 26:31.796
I don't really want to give you a critique
of your book over dinner.

26:31.880 --> 26:36.192
You'd have to be pretty foolish
not to accept criticism from an expert.

26:36.280 --> 26:39.750
Well, an expert on publishing,
not sociology.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.671
Not for me, thanks.
- She can't.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.034
I'm driving.

26:46.520 --> 26:49.990
But Mark did say you had
a few suggestions about changes.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.433
Yeah, one or two.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.795
I think you'll find I'm very open to ideas.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.838
Great... Good.

26:56.920 --> 27:02.233
OK... In the chapter on marriage
you use yourself as a case study,

27:02.320 --> 27:04.470
which I think is fascinating.

27:05.920 --> 27:07.478
But I thought

27:07.560 --> 27:11.075
it would be better to write about somebody
more widely known - say Madonna.

27:11.160 --> 27:14.152
Good. No shortage of material.

27:14.240 --> 27:15.992
No.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.996
No, I don't think so.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.115
Next?

27:25.640 --> 27:28.234
OK. At one point you say that you think

27:28.320 --> 27:33.713
that women shouldn't have children unless
they've been married at least five years.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.313
That's right.

27:35.400 --> 27:38.119
Well, do you not think that's a little...

27:38.200 --> 27:39.349
Fascist.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.715
..prescriptive?

27:41.800 --> 27:43.711
I mean, surely you want your book

27:43.800 --> 27:46.473
to be observational, not didactic?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.514
No, I'm not going to change that.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.713
Was there anything else?

27:54.800 --> 27:56.597
No.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.636
No. I don't think so.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.476
The salmon is delicious.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.316
Hey, I've had an idea.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.278
This woman used to do lunchtime
yoga classes.

28:17.360 --> 28:20.477
They were always packed out.
Why don't you take over?

28:20.560 --> 28:22.516
But I don't do yoga.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.756
Aerobics!

28:25.840 --> 28:27.796
Pete, that is a terrific idea!

28:27.880 --> 28:29.836
That's why you pay me. Well...

28:29.920 --> 28:34.471
What does ''Suitable for both sex
and all abilities'' mean?

28:34.560 --> 28:36.835
No, no! It's not supposed to say that!

28:36.920 --> 28:39.673
It's supposed to say
''Suitable for both sexes.''

28:39.760 --> 28:41.716
How do you stop this flaming thing?

28:43.840 --> 28:45.831
Oh! Just pull the paper out!

28:47.960 --> 28:49.916
Pete, you're a genius.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.991
This could really be something.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.116
Why are you doing this?

28:55.200 --> 28:57.156
How do you mean?

28:57.240 --> 29:00.789
Well, even my parents
aren't as nice to me as you are.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.916
Why am I doing this?

29:09.840 --> 29:11.796
It's simple really.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.836
I've fallen in love with you.

29:13.920 --> 29:17.230
You're sexy, you're attractive,
you're fun to be with.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.710
And you're the best thing
that's happened to me since Jenny.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.756
Oh, Pete...

29:27.040 --> 29:31.033
Why am I doing this? I don't know, really...

29:31.120 --> 29:33.076
I'm just a nice bloke who...

29:33.160 --> 29:35.355
who needs to get himself into shape.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.790
Laura's in the care of the authorities,

29:39.880 --> 29:42.189
so it's their decision to make.

29:43.720 --> 29:44.914
Do you follow?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.070
Sorry, I was a wee bit distracted.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.196
Your flies are undone.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.236
Oh...

29:52.320 --> 29:54.072
Thank you.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.673
It never impresses in court.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.716
So we haven't got a leg to stand on?

29:57.800 --> 30:00.473
Oh, you'll never hear a solicitor say that.

30:00.560 --> 30:03.154
No, we could apply for a judicial review,

30:03.240 --> 30:05.629
asking the court to determine

30:05.720 --> 30:09.429
that halting the process was unreasonable.
- It was certainly that!

30:09.520 --> 30:12.717
In your unqualified opinion.
- They matched us with Laura.

30:12.800 --> 30:15.712
It was going well. Everyone said so.
Then they stopped it.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.552
New information came to light.

30:17.640 --> 30:20.996
Which we didn't keep from them.
- We didn't even know it!

30:21.080 --> 30:25.073
They must review it with Laura's best
interests. - Us! We're her best interest!

30:25.160 --> 30:26.354
How long will this take?

30:26.440 --> 30:29.079
Somewhere between three months and a year.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.958
We'd apply for an interlocutory injunction

30:32.040 --> 30:33.632
to stop Laura being placed.

30:33.720 --> 30:36.075
Oh, I think we've a strong case, don't you?

30:36.160 --> 30:40.039
Well, at best, I'd say you have
an outside chance of success.

30:40.120 --> 30:42.076
They're being unreasonable!

30:42.160 --> 30:46.153
And besides, surely the fact
that we're prepared to go to court,

30:46.240 --> 30:48.151
with all the expense that entails,

30:48.240 --> 30:50.993
that shows our determination
to make a good home for Laura?

30:51.080 --> 30:53.310
How much would it cost?
- That doesn't matter.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.233
It does.
- I'd estimate not less than 20,000 pounds.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.514
What?!

30:57.600 --> 31:01.036
So that's that.
- No, not necessarily.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.031
Adam, it's 20,000 quid. Minimum.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.997
But if we win, we get costs.

31:05.080 --> 31:08.152
Since when have you been a gambler?
- I bet on the National.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.753
20,000 on a rank outsider?

31:09.840 --> 31:11.876
We can raise the money.
- How?

31:11.960 --> 31:14.269
And he said it'd take months.
- Three!

31:14.360 --> 31:16.954
To a year. And we'll have a baby by then.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.871
They won't place Laura in the meantime.

31:18.960 --> 31:22.157
But the stress of a court case.
- Most of it's just waiting.

31:23.320 --> 31:28.075
Why are we doing this? For Laura. We gave her
an undertaking. We won't let her down.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.230
So if I have to beg, borrow or steal

31:30.320 --> 31:33.392
to show her what she means to us,
then it's worth it.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.235
I had to get out of a meeting for this.

31:42.320 --> 31:45.596
It's the least you could do,
the damage you did to Jo's self-esteem.

31:45.680 --> 31:48.240
So chucking your guts up
was a vote of confidence?

31:49.760 --> 31:51.716
Why can't you call it Keep Fit?

31:51.800 --> 31:54.951
I mean...Aerobics. It's so...feminine.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.118
Hey.
- Hi.

31:58.200 --> 32:01.158
David! I didn't know you were coming.
- He was dead keen!

32:01.240 --> 32:02.958
Weren't you?

32:04.600 --> 32:06.556
Well, better start the music.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.958
Do you know if many are coming?

32:10.040 --> 32:11.871
Oh, I wouldn't expect too many,

32:11.960 --> 32:13.791
because it does clash, you see.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.393
I thought it was lunch hour.

32:15.480 --> 32:17.914
Er, yeah. That's what it clashes with.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.355
Is this the class for male strippers?

32:20.440 --> 32:23.034
Oi, mush, what do you think
you're doing here?

32:23.120 --> 32:26.032
I may have missed one session
but I'm not a quitter.

32:26.120 --> 32:27.758
I need to get fighting fit.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.671
<i>Speaking of fit...</i>

32:29.760 --> 32:31.716
Just a minute. This is for my firm only...

32:31.800 --> 32:33.677
And David.
- But Jo rang me.

32:33.760 --> 32:35.273
Adam, hi.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.316
Hello!

32:37.400 --> 32:39.356
Hey, we'll have you at the back.

32:39.440 --> 32:40.395
With me.

32:43.600 --> 32:48.355
OK, everybody, let's start off
with some gentle warm-up exercises.

32:48.480 --> 32:50.436
And...breathing in...

32:52.960 --> 32:54.916
..and out.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.956
In with the good...

32:58.040 --> 33:00.190
and out with the bad.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.316
And up...

33:03.400 --> 33:07.279
I've heard you didn't get past
the warm-up exercises before.

33:07.360 --> 33:11.069
And I heard why you didn't make it.
I'm very sorry to hear it.

33:11.160 --> 33:12.752
We'll take them to court.

33:12.840 --> 33:15.229
Can you do that?
- It's a free country.

33:15.320 --> 33:19.233
...and four...and reverse...
- And it's a pretty expensive one.

33:19.320 --> 33:23.233
Look...if we can be of any help -
borrowing money or something...

33:23.320 --> 33:25.072
Oh, right. Thanks. Yeah.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.832
And pelvic...

33:26.920 --> 33:28.558
One...two...

33:28.640 --> 33:30.596
Got 20 grand on you?

33:30.680 --> 33:32.159
How much?

33:32.240 --> 33:34.595
Let's cut out the chatter at the back,

33:34.680 --> 33:36.636
get some serious work done.

33:40.960 --> 33:44.748
In my youth I might have accepted
an author dismissing my opinion like that.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.957
Actually, even then
I would have had a problem with it.

33:48.040 --> 33:50.031
Yeah, I know Geraldine can be...

33:50.120 --> 33:52.076
a tad...forthright.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.116
But she had to be to get on.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.428
Just out of interest, Mark,

33:55.520 --> 33:57.431
exactly how do you think we're similar?

33:57.520 --> 34:00.318
Well, you both have um...strong opinions,

34:00.400 --> 34:02.197
and you don't back down easily.

34:02.280 --> 34:06.239
Which, you must admit, wouldn't make
for the easiest working relationship.

34:06.320 --> 34:08.117
Please don't quit!

34:08.199 --> 34:11.078
I am not quitting, Mark. I don't have
a job to quit.

34:11.159 --> 34:13.116
I'm trying to offer you one!

34:13.199 --> 34:16.272
I'm sorry. I don't think I can work
with your wife.

34:16.360 --> 34:17.793
Suppose you didn't have to.

34:19.880 --> 34:21.677
You make the changes you want.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.114
She'd never accept that.
- Look, Karen...

34:24.199 --> 34:28.193
Geraldine might be a little...difficult,
but she's not stupid.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.119
She wants to be read by the world at large,
not by academics.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.714
Do you think you can handle her?

34:35.800 --> 34:38.109
Well, over the years I've er...

34:38.199 --> 34:40.156
learned a couple of tricks.

34:40.239 --> 34:42.196
Patience being one of them.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.235
Judo another one.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.188
You'll do it?

34:48.280 --> 34:50.235
Yes.
- Excellent.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.550
I'll get Accounts to call you about money.

34:52.639 --> 34:54.835
They'll try to screw you. Don't let them.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.876
You might regret saying that, mate.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.712
I very much doubt it.

34:58.800 --> 35:01.109
Right, how about lunch on Thursday,

35:01.200 --> 35:03.316
to go over the changes you want to make?

35:05.800 --> 35:07.756
Oh, God! Here! Use that!

35:07.840 --> 35:09.796
Aw! Jesus!

35:09.880 --> 35:11.836
Have you been at the crisps?

35:11.920 --> 35:13.876
God...

35:13.960 --> 35:17.111
That went well.
They want to know when the next session is.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.952
And it's all thanks to you, Pete.

35:21.840 --> 35:25.310
You should get more people along,
once word of mouth starts.

35:25.400 --> 35:29.188
Yeah. Well, stick with it,
and I'll give you a brand-new body.

35:29.280 --> 35:30.474
Tom Cruise's?

35:30.560 --> 35:31.913
Good idea.
- You like him?

35:32.000 --> 35:33.991
No, but Karen does.

35:34.080 --> 35:38.073
Excuse me. Hello.
- A month? I suppose I can wait that long.

35:38.160 --> 35:40.116
What?

35:40.200 --> 35:42.156
Jesus. I'll be straight there.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.196
What is it?

35:44.280 --> 35:46.794
Rachel's gone to the hospital.
Stomach cramps.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.752
Are you all right?
- Fine.

35:56.840 --> 35:58.398
Have they seen you yet?
- Yep.

35:58.480 --> 36:00.118
The baby?
- It's fine.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.676
I was so worried.

36:03.760 --> 36:08.470
Let's drop this judicial review. Nothing's
more important than you and the baby.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.437
Adam...
- Strain caused this.

36:10.520 --> 36:13.432
We can't risk your health.
- Adam, I am fine.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.715
Then what was it?

36:17.240 --> 36:18.753
Does it hurt here?

36:18.840 --> 36:20.637
Yes, it does, yeah.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.359
Oh, my God. I'm sorry! I'm really sorry.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.556
Is that better?

36:28.640 --> 36:30.870
Wind?
- Apparently it's quite common.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.599
I raced here scared shitless
because of wind?

36:37.080 --> 36:38.035
Yes.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.075
Ah!

36:44.200 --> 36:46.156
Thank God for that.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.148
Let's drop this case. It's your
health, Rach.

36:50.240 --> 36:54.836
No. For a minute in there
I thought I was going to lose the baby.

36:54.920 --> 36:57.718
And then I realised we could lose
both of them!

36:58.760 --> 37:00.557
I want to fight, Adam.

37:00.640 --> 37:03.313
For us as well as Laura.

37:09.240 --> 37:12.277
That sounds absolutely fantastic. Brilliant.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.157
Great. So when do you want it by?

37:14.240 --> 37:16.356
Right... The 25th.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.158
The 25th of next month, yeah?

37:18.240 --> 37:19.912
Er...

37:20.960 --> 37:22.916
You are joking?

37:23.080 --> 37:25.469
Didn't I say time was pressing?

37:25.560 --> 37:27.676
Yeah, pressing, not suffocating.

37:27.760 --> 37:31.435
No wonder you said not to let your accounts
department screw me!

37:31.520 --> 37:34.751
Advice I notice you more than took to heart.

37:37.720 --> 37:40.996
So, come on, what do you reckon?
Can we make it?

37:41.080 --> 37:42.752
We can certainly try.

37:42.840 --> 37:46.037
Excellent... Excellent. Waiter...

37:46.120 --> 37:48.429
What do you want to drink? Champagne?

37:48.520 --> 37:51.637
Not for me, thanks. Just water's fine,
thank you.

37:51.720 --> 37:54.154
A large bottle of fizzy mineral water.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.196
Don't let me stop you.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.794
No, no. I never drink alone, you see.

37:58.880 --> 38:00.916
Why? Watching your figure?

38:01.000 --> 38:02.956
No.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.996
No, I don't drink...

38:05.080 --> 38:07.036
for the same reason...

38:07.120 --> 38:09.076
as you don't drink, I imagine.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.751
So, tell me, how long has it been?

38:17.120 --> 38:20.669
Listen, I'm not sure
I want to talk about this, actually.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.716
No, it's er...

38:23.800 --> 38:25.756
I am so sorry.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.957
It's really out of order.
I apologise. Sorry.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.996
Sorry.

38:31.080 --> 38:33.036
Six weeks.

38:34.200 --> 38:36.156
Wow.

38:36.240 --> 38:38.834
What about you?
- Me? Oh, well, you know...

38:41.880 --> 38:43.836
Just the 12 years.

38:45.960 --> 38:47.916
Twelve years?

38:48.000 --> 38:50.958
Bloody Nora! How the hell have
you done that?

38:52.640 --> 38:55.359
I really don't know. I haven't the foggiest.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.556
Day at a time.

39:03.120 --> 39:04.678
One! Two!

39:04.760 --> 39:06.512
Three! Four!

39:06.600 --> 39:09.160
Five! Six! Seven! And up!

39:09.240 --> 39:11.196
One! Two!

39:11.280 --> 39:13.236
Three! Four!

39:13.320 --> 39:16.790
Five! Six! Seven! And knees!

39:16.880 --> 39:18.836
One! Two!

39:18.920 --> 39:20.797
Three! Four! Five!

39:20.880 --> 39:23.599
Higher, Dudley! Seven! Eight!

39:23.680 --> 39:24.829
Good work, Pete!

39:25.720 --> 39:27.676
Three! Four!

39:27.760 --> 39:28.875
Five! Six!

39:28.960 --> 39:31.030
You didn't drink at dinner that night.

39:31.120 --> 39:35.318
It's a dead giveaway when you're
not driving.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.833
I never even noticed.

39:36.920 --> 39:38.831
Think about it. Why would you?

39:38.920 --> 39:42.390
You're new to this, aren't you?
- I thought I was the only one.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.436
You've got to be having a laugh.

39:44.520 --> 39:49.116
There's more of us out there
than you can fathom. Most still drinking.

39:50.840 --> 39:52.796
Thanks.
- More water, sir?

39:52.880 --> 39:57.396
Well, you know what? I'm working
this afternoon. What do you think?

39:57.480 --> 40:00.950
Well, as long as you stick to sparkling, eh,
and don't mix!

40:02.000 --> 40:04.833
Come on, let's go crazy. Another
bottle, please.

40:04.920 --> 40:07.036
Thanks.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.236
Oh...God.

40:09.320 --> 40:11.231
So...

40:11.320 --> 40:13.276
To friendship.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.510
And to having a bloody good time...

40:15.600 --> 40:19.752
...sober.
- Do you really think that's possible?

40:19.840 --> 40:22.070
Oh, yeah.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.159
Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:28.200 --> 40:30.156
Oh!

40:30.240 --> 40:32.435
Look, we haven't got any muscle rub.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.476
Oh!
- You'll have to try this.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.516
Oh...

40:36.600 --> 40:38.556
Anything...

40:38.640 --> 40:40.596
Agh! I'm in agony!

40:40.680 --> 40:44.389
You probably used muscles
you haven't used for a long time.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.436
Yeah, if ever.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.476
Agh...

40:50.600 --> 40:52.556
Please, can you do it?

40:52.640 --> 40:56.189
I'm not falling for that one.
- I'm in agony!

40:56.280 --> 40:58.236
Ooh! Right...

41:00.640 --> 41:02.596
Shoulders only.

41:28.120 --> 41:30.031
I had lunch with Mark today.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.076
Oh, yes?

41:34.200 --> 41:36.998
He's pleased with the work
I've done on the book.

41:44.400 --> 41:47.358
I'm feeling much happier
about things, David.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.436
Mmmm... That's fantastic.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.476
What, the massage?

41:52.560 --> 41:55.438
No, that you're feeling happier
about things.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.436
Yeah.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.476
And the massage.

42:03.960 --> 42:05.916
It is good, isn't it?

42:31.960 --> 42:32.915
Oh, hiya.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.797
I was hoping to have a word.

42:34.880 --> 42:37.678
Yeah, of course. Come in. Straight through.

42:40.240 --> 42:42.470
I want to ask you to drop this court action.

42:42.560 --> 42:46.678
It's not in Laura's best interests.

42:46.760 --> 42:49.194
What, she doesn't want us to adopt her?

42:49.280 --> 42:51.874
She'd love you to,
but she doesn't know about your baby.

42:51.960 --> 42:54.918
What difference will that make?
- Laura's not an only child.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.958
Her mother had another daughter
after she was born.

42:58.040 --> 43:00.235
Yes, we know. To a different father.

43:00.320 --> 43:02.754
And he wanted nothing to do with Laura.

43:02.840 --> 43:05.274
But think what she must have felt like,

43:05.360 --> 43:08.989
rejected by her own mother
when another child came along.

43:09.120 --> 43:11.236
Well, hold on. We're not them.

43:11.320 --> 43:14.551
We'd make every effort
to ensure that didn't happen.

43:14.640 --> 43:17.712
I know you would.
But who's to say it would be enough?

43:17.800 --> 43:19.756
Look...

43:19.840 --> 43:23.037
Laura will be looking for you to fail her.
Pushing you...

43:23.120 --> 43:26.157
Testing you... And if it didn't work out...

43:26.240 --> 43:29.596
well, I doubt if she'd ever trust
another person again.

43:29.680 --> 43:33.229
It would work out. That's the whole point.
We'd make it work out.

43:33.320 --> 43:35.072
If you care...

43:35.160 --> 43:38.197
give her a chance to find another family.

44:14.080 --> 44:16.275
Thanks for being so understanding.

44:16.360 --> 44:19.989
You know, all along we only wanted
what's best for Laura.

44:20.080 --> 44:22.071
Oh, I don't know. I don't like it.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.116
You know what I mean?

44:24.200 --> 44:27.237
What if Laura thinks we've
rejected her as well?

44:27.320 --> 44:28.878
Trust me.

44:28.960 --> 44:30.518
Good luck.

44:30.600 --> 44:32.158
Thanks.

44:34.360 --> 44:35.918
Sorry.

44:38.600 --> 44:41.797
Bye.
- Bye.

44:48.880 --> 44:50.836
You OK?

44:52.000 --> 44:53.956
I will be.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.788
Doing the right thing
doesn't make you feel better, does it?

44:59.840 --> 45:01.796
Adam. Look.

45:08.120 --> 45:10.076
<i>I hope she finds someone.</i>

45:17.000 --> 45:18.194
Right...

45:19.240 --> 45:21.196
Home.

45:26.360 --> 45:28.430
You can't stay. I'm expecting Jo.

45:28.520 --> 45:30.476
Well, nice to see you, too.

45:30.560 --> 45:33.870
I thought I'd pop round for a chat
and bring you up to date.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.356
What are these in aid of?

45:39.120 --> 45:42.078
They're for Jo.
I thought it was time I told her how I feel.

45:42.160 --> 45:44.116
She's a good-looking girl.

45:44.200 --> 45:46.589
But she's way out of my league.
Once she gets...

45:46.680 --> 45:49.478
Don't run yourself down. You're
getting in shape.

45:49.560 --> 45:52.711
But it'll take time, won't it?
- If you stop throwing up...

45:54.840 --> 45:57.434
I'll go.
- No, don't make it obvious. Stay.

45:57.520 --> 45:59.397
Only for a minute.

45:59.480 --> 46:01.630
Hi! How are you?

46:01.720 --> 46:03.711
Um...you know Suggs, don't you?

46:03.800 --> 46:04.994
Hi, Gifford.

46:05.080 --> 46:07.674
Hi. All right?
- We're just going for a drink.

46:07.760 --> 46:09.159
Who are the flowers for?

46:09.240 --> 46:11.071
They're er...

46:11.160 --> 46:12.434
for Rachel.

46:12.520 --> 46:14.750
Oh. Karen said she was OK.

46:14.840 --> 46:16.114
Yeah. False alarm.

46:16.960 --> 46:18.916
Thanks for asking.
- Cool.

46:20.080 --> 46:23.038
Want to come upstairs for a minute?
I'll just be a second.

46:23.120 --> 46:25.190
Sure. See you, guys.
- See you.

46:26.109 --> 46:28.875
Sorry.

46:28.960 --> 46:30.916
Yeah. Me too.
