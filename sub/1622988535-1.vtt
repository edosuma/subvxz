WEBVTT

00:51.677 --> 00:52.886
Listen, Tommaso,

00:52.970 --> 00:55.764
do we really need to fish near the island?

00:55.848 --> 00:57.975
-Eh, you worry too much.
-I don't know.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.102
What if the old stories are true?

01:00.185 --> 01:01.687
TOMMASO: Oh, come on, Giacomo.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.939
You really believe in sea monsters?

01:04.106 --> 01:06.859
Too many strange things have
been seen in these waters.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.527
They're all just stories.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.488
Tall tales to keep us away
from a great fishing spot.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.365
-GIACOMO: But, Tommaso...
-We're fine.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.707
Ah, that's more like it.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.110
What is that?

02:16.011 --> 02:17.179
You missed. Let's go,

02:17.262 --> 02:18.972
before it comes back for us.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.557
GIACOMO: I told you they were real.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.018
TOMMASO: Oh, what a monster!

02:23.519 --> 02:24.728
Horrifying!

02:33.403 --> 02:35.322
Fish out of the barn!
Fish out of the barn!

02:36.031 --> 02:37.115
No, no, no!

02:37.199 --> 02:38.742
Mom's gonna kill me!

02:39.368 --> 02:40.536
Caterina!

02:40.994 --> 02:42.871
-Wait!

02:44.915 --> 02:45.916
Whoa!

02:45.999 --> 02:47.668
Oh, good morning, Mr. Branzino.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.628
-And also, I'm sorry.
-

02:49.711 --> 02:51.004
Well, how's Mrs. Branzino?

02:51.088 --> 02:52.172
Hi, Luca.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.430
Excuse me, ma'am. Have you...

03:00.597 --> 03:01.723
Yes.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.188
Giuseppe, get back here!

03:08.272 --> 03:10.774
You want to run off like
your buddy Enrico?

03:10.858 --> 03:14.319
Because I've got news for you.
He's either dead, or he's

03:14.695 --> 03:17.406
out there. Somewhere. Seeing the world.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.075
But he's probably dead.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.036
Phew. Okay, that's everyone.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.706
Monalisa, why are you smiling?

03:26.665 --> 03:27.875
Anyone else in there?

03:29.793 --> 03:31.461
Giuseppe.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.589
What did we just talk about?

03:35.424 --> 03:36.842
Oh, Giuseppe.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.595
All right. Let's head out.

03:46.268 --> 03:48.061
-Hello.
-Good morning.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.940
-LUCA: Hi, Mrs. Aragosta.
-Hey, Luca!

03:56.528 --> 03:58.405
LUCA: Good morning!
SEA FARMER: Morning!

04:14.713 --> 04:16.423
Okay. All clear.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.806
Let me know if you need anything.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.226
Anyone?

04:28.060 --> 04:29.978
No? Okay.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.413
Giuseppe...

05:06.974 --> 05:08.517
-

05:09.768 --> 05:10.894
Oh.

05:13.605 --> 05:14.606
Huh?

05:36.295 --> 05:38.046
-

05:38.130 --> 05:40.549
Land monsters! Everybody, under the rock!

06:10.162 --> 06:11.163
Huh?

06:12.372 --> 06:13.457
DANIELA: Luca!

06:14.082 --> 06:15.876
Lunch is ready!

06:16.043 --> 06:17.294
Be right there!

06:23.258 --> 06:24.927
Come on! We gotta get back.

06:28.847 --> 06:29.848
DANIELA: You're two minutes late.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.099
-Was there a boat? Huh?
-LUCA: Uh...

06:31.183 --> 06:32.267
-Did you hide?
-Yes, Mom.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.853
Because if they catch
even a glimpse of you...

06:34.937 --> 06:36.772
You think they come around
to meet new friends, huh?

06:36.855 --> 06:38.315
-No.
-Make small talk.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.399
-I... I don't.
-No.

06:39.483 --> 06:40.984
-They're here to do murders.
-Uh-huh.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.152
So, I'm just making sure you know.

06:42.236 --> 06:43.237
Thanks, Mom.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.321
When I was a kid,

06:44.404 --> 06:46.156
we'd go weeks without seeing a boat,

06:46.240 --> 06:48.200
and let me tell you,
they did not have motors.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.786
Just a sweaty land monster with a paddle.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.955
-Hi, Grandma. Mwah.
-Hey, Bubble.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.331
-Hi, Dad.
-Luca!

06:54.748 --> 06:57.501
Look at Pinchy-pessa. She's molting.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.878
-Oh, it's magnificent.
-

06:59.962 --> 07:03.173
Now, here's a champion
show crab if I ever saw one.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.967
-Oh, nice.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:05.050 --> 07:06.802
-Don't look her in the eye!
-Sorry.

07:06.885 --> 07:10.013
But don't apologize.
She can sense weakness.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.223
-Oh!

07:11.890 --> 07:13.267
Come eat, Luca. Come on.

07:13.392 --> 07:16.103
We better beat those Branzinos
at the crab show this year.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.189
Everyone thinks Bianca Branzino's so great

07:19.273 --> 07:20.774
with her prize-winning crabs

07:20.858 --> 07:23.777
and amazing dolphin impression. Please!

07:23.861 --> 07:25.237
Anyone can do that.

07:26.655 --> 07:27.656
Right?

07:27.739 --> 07:29.825
I don't know why dolphins
even sound like that.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.660
You know, why don't they just talk?

07:31.743 --> 07:32.744
-Luca.
-Huh?

07:32.828 --> 07:34.204
GRANDMA PAGURO: What's on your mind?

07:34.288 --> 07:37.457
Uh... Uh... Well, I was just wondering...

07:38.208 --> 07:39.334
Where do boats come from?

07:40.836 --> 07:43.589
The land monster town.
Just above the surface.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.841
I beat a guy at cards there once.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.718
-Mom! What are you doing?

07:47.801 --> 07:49.845
He's old enough to hear about it.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.347
You've been to the surface
and done the change?

07:52.431 --> 07:54.349
No! No! The end! Shut it down!

07:54.433 --> 07:56.310
I was just curious.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.812
Yeah? Well, the curious fish gets caught.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.398
We do not talk, think,
discuss, contemplate,

08:01.481 --> 08:04.067
or go anywhere near the surface! Got it?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.319
Yes, Mom.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.529
Here. Now let's get back to work.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.118
Hey.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.288
Look me in the eye.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.373
You know I love you, right?

08:18.457 --> 08:19.708
I know, Mom.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.881
We're a little worried about him, right?

08:25.964 --> 08:28.091
No, thanks! I'm full.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.519
Huh?

08:44.650 --> 08:45.776
Hmm.

08:57.538 --> 08:58.664
Whoa.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.500
Hmm.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.460
Hmm.

09:20.269 --> 09:21.311
Boo.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.437
LUCA: Huh?

09:22.521 --> 09:24.690
It's fine. I'm not human.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.650
Thank goodness.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.527
-Here, hold this.
-

09:33.323 --> 09:36.243
Uh... Do you live around here?

09:36.326 --> 09:39.079
Down here? No, no, no.
I just came for my stuff.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.163
Ooh.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.584
Uh, hey! Wait, that's mine!

09:48.630 --> 09:50.841
Sir? You forgot your harpoon and...

09:50.924 --> 09:52.301
Oh, yeah. Thanks!

09:52.384 --> 09:54.178
LUCA: What? What are you doing?

10:01.810 --> 10:02.811
No, no!

10:02.895 --> 10:04.813
Ahh! Oh, no!

10:06.982 --> 10:08.108
Help me!

10:08.609 --> 10:09.943
First time?

10:10.110 --> 10:13.238
Of course it is! I'm a good kid!

10:13.322 --> 10:14.740
-Hey, relax.

10:14.823 --> 10:15.866
Breathe.

10:38.722 --> 10:39.723
Whoa.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.726
Well? Isn't it great?

10:42.809 --> 10:43.810
No!

10:43.894 --> 10:46.772
It's bad, and I'm not
supposed to be up here.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.148
Good day.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.656
Thank you.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.910
Good... Good day. Again.

11:08.210 --> 11:09.211
Grandma,

11:10.045 --> 11:11.296
did you really go up to the...

11:26.019 --> 11:29.940
Okay, everyone. This is, uh, Smuca.

11:30.107 --> 11:33.026
Yeah. He's in charge now. Got it?

11:55.549 --> 11:56.758
-Wow.
-Aah!

11:56.842 --> 11:58.260
That was hard to watch.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.344
Here.

11:59.803 --> 12:00.804
Come on.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.913
Whoa.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.543
Wait.

12:31.627 --> 12:33.253
It feels like it's still there.

12:33.337 --> 12:34.505
Yeah, that's called phantom tail.

12:34.588 --> 12:35.589
You'll get used to it.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.885
Right. Walking.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.763
Don't worry, you're in luck.
I basically invented it.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.557
To start, stack everything
one on top of the other.

12:45.641 --> 12:47.226
Like a pile of rocks.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.231
Great! I mean, fine, whatever.

12:52.314 --> 12:54.441
Now, walking is just like swimming.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.401
But without fins. Or a tail.

12:56.485 --> 12:57.611
And also, there's no water.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.404
Otherwise, it's like the exact same thing.

12:59.488 --> 13:00.614
Give it a try.

13:02.658 --> 13:03.825
That's not it. Try it again.

13:05.244 --> 13:07.579
Oh, try to lead with your head.

13:07.663 --> 13:09.248
No, more belly.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.168
That's... That's lying on the ground.

13:13.252 --> 13:14.253
How about this?

13:14.336 --> 13:16.296
Just take a step without
even thinking about it.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.048
No, no, no, don't think about it.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.050
I don't know how to
not think about something.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.427
Okay, okay. Watch.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.471
Point your feet to where
you wanna go. Okay?

13:24.555 --> 13:26.682
And then you just catch yourself

13:26.765 --> 13:27.766
before you fall.

13:30.853 --> 13:31.937
Yeah, that's right.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.482
Heh.

13:37.276 --> 13:39.027
-Good. Good.
-

13:39.111 --> 13:41.572
-Yes. Yes!
-I'm... I'm getting it!

13:42.406 --> 13:44.950
Not bad, kid. Alberto Scorfano.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.034
Luca Paguro.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.540
It's a human thing. I'm kind of an expert.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.041
What does it mean?

13:54.209 --> 13:55.627
The thing you just said?

13:55.794 --> 13:57.754
Come on. I'll show you some more stuff!

13:59.590 --> 14:01.091
Mother-of-pearl!

14:01.717 --> 14:02.718
You live up here?

14:02.801 --> 14:04.094
Yeah. Me and my dad.

14:04.178 --> 14:05.262
He's not even here a whole lot,

14:05.345 --> 14:06.930
so I pretty much just do whatever I want.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.140
Isn't it dangerous?

14:08.223 --> 14:09.433
Yeah, it's the best!

14:09.516 --> 14:11.310
Everything good is above the surface.

14:11.727 --> 14:13.520
Like, what else?

14:18.066 --> 14:20.402
Gravity! Also known as falling!

14:22.905 --> 14:25.699
The sky. Clouds. The sun.

14:25.991 --> 14:27.743
Whoa. Don't look at it.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.536
Just kidding. Definitely look at it.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.999
And then, there's human stuff.

14:37.336 --> 14:38.420
Whoa.

14:39.463 --> 14:40.464
As you can see,

14:40.547 --> 14:42.341
I've been collecting for a long time,

14:42.424 --> 14:43.425
so ask me anything.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.554
-

14:47.638 --> 14:50.057
Yes. That's the Magic
Singing Lady Machine.

14:50.224 --> 14:52.559
It's broken, unfortunately.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.522
Whoa! You unbroke it!

15:06.114 --> 15:07.115
LUCA: What's that?

15:07.199 --> 15:10.202
Oh, it's just the greatest thing
that humans ever made.

15:10.285 --> 15:11.620
The Vespa.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.580
-Whoa.
-You just sit on it,

15:13.664 --> 15:15.541
and it takes you anywhere you wanna go.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.334
In the whole stinkin' world!

15:19.419 --> 15:21.463
LUCA: "Vespa is freedom."

15:24.299 --> 15:25.300
Huh?

15:29.721 --> 15:30.722
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

15:30.806 --> 15:32.015
Yeah!

15:34.518 --> 15:35.519
ALBERTO: Pretty cool, right?

15:35.602 --> 15:38.355
Uh... Yeah.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.942
Huh. Are you gonna make one?

15:42.025 --> 15:43.861
I think you have all the parts.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.363
I do have the parts.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.490
I am gonna make one! You wanna help?

15:48.574 --> 15:52.244
Me? Yeah! Wait! No, I can't.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.204
-I gotta go home.
-Right this second?

15:54.288 --> 15:56.582
Yeah, if my parents found out
I was up here...

15:58.125 --> 16:00.752
It would be bad. So, thank you, but...

16:03.088 --> 16:05.591
Goodbye. Forever.

16:08.594 --> 16:11.680
Okay, but now, I really do have to go.

16:11.763 --> 16:12.890
Okay. Bye.

16:14.683 --> 16:17.603
Seriously, I have to go,
like, now. Like, right now.

16:17.686 --> 16:18.937
Okay. See ya.

16:21.857 --> 16:23.525
It's even better than the picture.

16:23.609 --> 16:24.610
Yeah, it is.

16:25.194 --> 16:26.945
Gotta run.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.780
ALBERTO: See ya tomorrow!

16:34.620 --> 16:36.246
Luca! Where have you been?

16:36.330 --> 16:37.331
Uh...

16:37.414 --> 16:39.124
LUCA: Don't say surface.
Don't say surface.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.503
What did you just say?

16:42.586 --> 16:43.587
What's wrong with your foot?

16:44.963 --> 16:45.964
DANIELA: Luca.

16:46.757 --> 16:49.259
-Oh, I... I...
-Gonna tell us where you were?

16:49.635 --> 16:51.512
-Uh...
-It's my fault.

16:51.595 --> 16:53.430
I sent him to look for sea cucumbers.

16:53.514 --> 16:56.433
Right! Sorry, Grandma,
I couldn't find them.

16:56.517 --> 16:57.726
DANIELA: Mom, his life is

16:57.809 --> 16:59.895
maybe a little more important
than your snacks.

17:00.479 --> 17:01.939
Thank you.

17:09.238 --> 17:10.864
Whoa! How'd you get it down?

17:11.031 --> 17:12.115
I rode it down.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.661
-Uh...
-I didn't.

17:15.744 --> 17:17.913
But I pushed it out the back window.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.498
Took a while to put back together,

17:19.581 --> 17:20.666
but it's fine now.

17:21.416 --> 17:22.626
You ready to ride it?

17:26.088 --> 17:29.925
Oh, well, thank you, but no thank you.

17:30.509 --> 17:32.511
I mean, I just think maybe I would die.

17:32.678 --> 17:35.264
Okay, I'll ride it. You hold the ramp.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.348
LUCA: Uh...

17:37.766 --> 17:40.394
Sir, maybe we should sleep on it?

17:40.477 --> 17:42.938
ALBERTO: Whatever you do, do not move!

17:43.021 --> 17:44.523
I'm not the guy you want for this.

17:44.606 --> 17:45.649
I'm more of an idea man...

17:45.732 --> 17:47.776
Take me, gravity!

17:50.696 --> 17:51.989
Um...

17:53.407 --> 17:55.033
This is normal! Stay focused!

17:57.619 --> 17:59.204
-

17:59.288 --> 18:00.497
Don't move, don't move, don't move!

18:05.544 --> 18:07.921
He's dead. I killed him!

18:10.174 --> 18:11.884
-Wait. That was good?
-ALBERTO: Oh, my...

18:11.967 --> 18:14.052
Did you see the height I got?

18:14.219 --> 18:15.804
Hey, nice ramping.

18:15.971 --> 18:17.472
Come on, let's build another one.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.156
ALBERTO: Yahoo!

18:34.239 --> 18:35.699
-

18:36.408 --> 18:37.951
Huh? Huh?

18:42.039 --> 18:43.207
-ALBERTO: Ha-ha!

18:48.003 --> 18:49.379
Whoo-hoo!

18:50.589 --> 18:52.257
Come on, Luca!

19:13.111 --> 19:14.238
-Huh.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.914
What's wrong with you, stupido?

19:25.582 --> 19:28.043
What's wrong with you, stupido?

19:39.805 --> 19:41.390
ALBERTO: Look, we gotta ride together.

19:41.473 --> 19:43.267
If you don't sit on the back
and hold on to the front,

19:43.350 --> 19:44.768
the whole thing falls apart.

19:44.852 --> 19:47.271
Oh. And who's holding the ramp?

19:47.646 --> 19:50.107
The turtle. Come on.
He's faster than he looks.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.609
Oh, okay. Here we go.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.737
You, uh, coming?

19:55.821 --> 19:58.198
Nope. I can't do it.
Never in a million years.

19:58.282 --> 20:00.117
Hey, hey, hey. I know your problem.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.451
You've got a Bruno in your head.

20:01.869 --> 20:03.161
-A Bruno?
-Yeah.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.413
I get one, too, sometimes.

20:04.496 --> 20:06.957
"Alberto, you can't."
"Alberto, you're gonna die."

20:07.040 --> 20:08.876
"Alberto, don't put that in your mouth."

20:09.042 --> 20:12.045
Luca, it's simple.
Don't listen to stupid Bruno.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.631
Why is his name Bruno?

20:14.715 --> 20:15.716
I don't care. It doesn't matter.

20:15.799 --> 20:16.884
Call him whatever you want.

20:16.967 --> 20:19.386
Shut him up. Say, "Silenzio, Bruno."

20:22.014 --> 20:23.140
Silenzio, Bruno.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.434
Louder! "Silenzio, Bruno!"

20:25.517 --> 20:27.644
-Silenzio, Bruno.
-"Silenzio, Bruno!"

20:27.728 --> 20:28.729
Silenzio, Bruno!

20:28.812 --> 20:31.315
-Can you still hear him?
-Nope! Just you!

20:31.398 --> 20:33.483
Good! Now, hang on!

20:35.694 --> 20:37.237
Andiamo!

20:41.533 --> 20:43.493
-ALBERTO: Yeah!
-

20:46.622 --> 20:47.998
Silenzio, Bruno. Silenzio, Bruno.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.082
Silenzio, Bruno.

20:49.166 --> 20:50.876
-Silenzio, Bruno.
-

21:00.636 --> 21:02.554
-Whoa.
-Wow.

21:02.638 --> 21:03.639
-Uh-oh.
-

21:12.523 --> 21:14.566
-Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
-

21:14.650 --> 21:17.528
Yes! We're alive! I can't believe it!

21:17.611 --> 21:19.404
-Take that, Bruno!
-Yes!

21:23.158 --> 21:25.410
LUCA: What are all those tiny lights?

21:25.744 --> 21:27.913
Anchovies. They go there to sleep.

21:29.665 --> 21:30.874
-Really?
-Yeah.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.001
And the big fish protects them.

21:33.085 --> 21:34.086
I touched it once.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.129
I don't know, it felt like a fish.

21:36.213 --> 21:37.214
Wow.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.675
Your life is so much cooler than mine.

21:39.758 --> 21:41.009
I never go anywhere.

21:41.635 --> 21:43.262
I just dream about it.

21:43.512 --> 21:44.680
You came up here.

21:44.847 --> 21:45.931
Thanks to you.

21:46.598 --> 21:49.017
Otherwise, I never would've
seen any of this.

21:53.230 --> 21:54.940
Have you ever gone to the human town?

21:55.023 --> 21:56.024
Yeah!

21:56.108 --> 21:57.526
Uh... No.

21:57.609 --> 21:59.945
But, but my dad told me all about it.

22:00.028 --> 22:01.572
So, I'm pretty much an expert.

22:02.573 --> 22:04.283
Your dad sounds so cool.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.368
You're lucky he lets you do what you want.

22:06.785 --> 22:07.870
Yeah. For sure.

22:11.790 --> 22:13.792
Hey, you remember that time
we almost hit that rock?

22:13.876 --> 22:15.252
-And we flew through the air,

22:15.335 --> 22:18.338
and I was like, "Yeah!"
And then you were like, "No!"

22:20.883 --> 22:23.468
Wouldn't it be amazing
to have a real Vespa?

22:23.552 --> 22:26.555
Yeah. That's the dream.

22:27.181 --> 22:28.307
Yeah.

22:34.396 --> 22:35.522
LUCA: Whoo!

22:37.149 --> 22:38.901
Oh, Luca, look!

22:40.068 --> 22:41.653
-BOTH: Whoa!

22:41.737 --> 22:43.572
-Wild Vespas!
-

22:44.406 --> 22:45.574
Whoo-hoo!

22:46.617 --> 22:47.910
Luca, take over!

22:49.036 --> 22:51.163
Yeah, man!

22:54.583 --> 22:55.667
Come on, faster!

22:57.044 --> 23:00.047
Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

23:00.130 --> 23:02.508
Whoo-hoo!

23:10.474 --> 23:12.267
BOTH: Whoa.

23:16.647 --> 23:19.191
I'm doing it, Alberto! I'm doing it!

23:19.816 --> 23:20.817
Alberto?

23:27.783 --> 23:30.536
Oh, no! I fell asleep!

23:30.702 --> 23:31.954
What?

23:35.749 --> 23:36.792
Phew.

23:36.875 --> 23:38.293
-

23:41.755 --> 23:42.756
Uh...

23:43.549 --> 23:46.343
Daniela, do we really need
to go through with this?

23:46.426 --> 23:47.553
With what?

23:47.636 --> 23:50.806
Uh, son, you're in big trouble.

23:50.889 --> 23:52.558
You need to promise us

23:52.641 --> 23:56.311
that you'll never sneak off
to the surface again.

23:56.395 --> 23:57.980
Uh, I'm really sorry.

23:58.063 --> 24:01.316
But, you know, it's not
that dangerous up there.

24:01.400 --> 24:02.526
Maybe I could show you.

24:02.609 --> 24:05.195
I told you. Our son has a death wish.

24:05.279 --> 24:06.947
But, Mom, we're always careful!

24:07.030 --> 24:08.031
BOTH: "We"?

24:08.991 --> 24:11.577
Me and my friend, Alberto.

24:11.952 --> 24:14.037
But it's okay. He's one of us.

24:14.121 --> 24:17.833
Ah, yes. There's usually a bad influence.

24:18.208 --> 24:21.170
Good thing you sent for me
when you did, huh?

24:21.670 --> 24:25.257
Luca, this is my brother, your Uncle Ugo.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.176
Thanks again for coming all this way

24:27.259 --> 24:28.552
on such short notice.

24:29.428 --> 24:30.679
Of course.

24:30.762 --> 24:31.972
Hello, Luca.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.395
Luca, I need you to punch his heart.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.772
That's right. The red thing. Punch it.

24:40.856 --> 24:42.274
-Harder!
-Oh.

24:42.357 --> 24:43.984
-

24:44.067 --> 24:46.820
Thanks for that. Too much oxygen up here.

24:46.904 --> 24:50.532
Not like the deep.
As you'll learn.

24:51.241 --> 24:52.242
What?

24:52.326 --> 24:53.869
Sure, there's no sunlight,

24:53.952 --> 24:56.246
but there's nothing to see anyway.

24:56.330 --> 25:00.083
Or do. It's just you and your thoughts,

25:00.834 --> 25:04.046
and all the whale carcass you can eat.

25:04.254 --> 25:06.965
Little bits of it
just float into your mouth.

25:07.049 --> 25:08.217
You can't stop it.

25:08.300 --> 25:10.719
You can't see it. So if you...

25:10.802 --> 25:13.722
The mouth opened,
the whale carcass go in.

25:13.889 --> 25:16.016
Yes, good. I recommend it.

25:16.934 --> 25:18.519
Come on. No time to waste.

25:18.602 --> 25:20.354
Mom, what does he mean?

25:20.437 --> 25:22.397
You're going to stay with Uncle Ugo

25:22.481 --> 25:23.607
for the rest of the season.

25:23.690 --> 25:24.775
No, I can't!

25:24.858 --> 25:27.361
Two seasons, then. Wanna go for three?

25:27.444 --> 25:28.820
Why are you doing this?

25:28.904 --> 25:31.698
The world is a very dangerous place, Luca,

25:31.782 --> 25:34.201
and if I have to send you
to the bottom of the ocean

25:34.284 --> 25:35.911
to keep you safe, so be it.

25:35.994 --> 25:37.287
You don't know what it's like up there!

25:37.371 --> 25:40.457
I know you. And I know
what's best for you.

25:40.541 --> 25:42.167
It's done.

25:43.627 --> 25:46.088
Hey. Look me in the eye.

25:46.588 --> 25:48.757
You know I love you, right?

26:02.271 --> 26:04.106
LUCA: They're sending me to the deep!

26:04.189 --> 26:05.816
To live with my weird see-through uncle!

26:05.899 --> 26:07.484
-What do I do?
-Stay?

26:07.568 --> 26:09.361
Up here? They'll come looking for me.

26:09.444 --> 26:10.988
Okay, that may be true,

26:11.613 --> 26:14.908
but will they come
looking for you over there?

26:16.076 --> 26:17.828
No way. That's crazy.

26:17.911 --> 26:20.414
I mean, that place must be full of Vespas.

26:20.497 --> 26:22.416
-There's gotta be one for us.
-Huh.

26:22.541 --> 26:24.084
A real Vespa.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.003
Could we even survive over there?

26:26.086 --> 26:28.839
You and me? We can do anything.

26:28.922 --> 26:30.591
We'd swim right over to Vespatown,

26:30.674 --> 26:31.758
track down Signor Vespa,

26:31.842 --> 26:33.969
Wait. Do you really think
there's a Signor Vespa?

26:34.052 --> 26:35.971
-Makes sense, right?
-Yes. Continue.

26:36.054 --> 26:39.975
And we say, "Signor Vespa,
build us one of these!"

26:40.058 --> 26:42.853
Whoa. This is the greatest
drawing I've ever seen.

26:42.936 --> 26:45.731
Yeah, I know. Luca, think about it.

26:45.981 --> 26:47.900
Every day, we'll ride someplace new,

26:47.983 --> 26:50.611
and every night,
we'll sleep under the fish.

26:50.694 --> 26:53.697
No one to tell us what to do.
Just you and me out there.

26:54.323 --> 26:55.324
Free.

26:55.407 --> 26:56.491
-ALBERTO: Whoo-hoo!
-

26:56.575 --> 26:58.452
Take me, gravity!

27:05.125 --> 27:06.376
Silenzio, Bruno.

27:07.252 --> 27:08.837
Whoo-hoo!

27:10.047 --> 27:11.131
ALBERTO: Yeah!

27:16.094 --> 27:17.888
-

27:21.683 --> 27:23.352
Come on!

27:24.645 --> 27:25.771
Ha-ha!

27:50.087 --> 27:51.964
Yeah! Whoo!

28:00.180 --> 28:01.265
Whoa.

28:03.892 --> 28:06.103
Papà, what's that?

28:08.438 --> 28:09.857
How do we get in?

28:23.203 --> 28:24.538
This will be a breeze.

28:24.621 --> 28:26.373
-Just don't get wet.
-Uh...

28:35.215 --> 28:37.092
Actually, this town seems
a little crowded.

28:37.176 --> 28:38.844
Hey! Silenzio, Bruno.

28:39.011 --> 28:40.721
What's wrong with you, stupido?

28:40.804 --> 28:41.805
MAN: Huh?

28:43.515 --> 28:44.808
-Huh! It worked.
-See?

28:45.142 --> 28:47.186
You just gotta follow my lead.

29:12.127 --> 29:13.170
-

29:15.923 --> 29:18.133
Classic human town. Pretty cool, right?

29:18.217 --> 29:20.010
Hey, you do it now. Just say the thing.

29:20.928 --> 29:21.929
BOTH: Mmm.

29:22.012 --> 29:23.597
Madams,

29:23.680 --> 29:25.432
what's wrong with you, stupido?

29:26.600 --> 29:28.477
-

29:33.815 --> 29:35.234
Maybe I said it wrong?

29:35.317 --> 29:36.568
Mmm. Mmm!

29:39.988 --> 29:40.989
Wow!

29:41.532 --> 29:42.533
Mmm!

29:51.083 --> 29:53.544
Alberto, this is too dangerous.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.087
Let's get out of here.

29:55.546 --> 29:56.588
-And go where?
-

30:01.677 --> 30:02.678
-Whoa.

30:02.761 --> 30:03.929
It's Signor Vespa!

30:04.012 --> 30:06.181
-

30:06.265 --> 30:07.975
Mannaggia! Here we go.

30:09.184 --> 30:11.812
Oh, mamma mia! Please, no more revving.

30:13.564 --> 30:15.065
Ciao! Ciao!

30:16.692 --> 30:18.652
-Beep, beep!

30:18.735 --> 30:21.697
Pride of Portorosso coming through!

30:21.780 --> 30:23.282
-Ciao, belle!
-WOMAN: Hmm, blech!

30:23.365 --> 30:24.700
You're making me blush.

30:26.827 --> 30:30.747
And now, who wants to watch me
eat a big sandwich? Hmm?

30:32.291 --> 30:33.792
There it is.

30:33.876 --> 30:35.961
That's how we're gonna see the world.

30:36.044 --> 30:37.629
Hey, little help?

30:40.257 --> 30:41.258
KID 1: Huh?
KID 2: Hmm?

30:46.513 --> 30:48.765
Oh, mamma mia!
Talk to Ercole. Are you hurt?

30:48.849 --> 30:49.850
Well, my head kinda hurts...

30:49.933 --> 30:52.102
Not you, Ciccio! Out of the way!

30:52.311 --> 30:56.064
Oh, piccolina, if there is
so much as a scratch...

30:57.274 --> 30:59.735
Someone got lucky today. Hmm?

30:59.818 --> 31:01.028
Who got lucky?

31:03.280 --> 31:05.657
Mm-hmm. Out-of-towners, eh?

31:05.741 --> 31:07.326
Let me welcome you.

31:10.162 --> 31:11.205
-Ciccio?
-

31:11.288 --> 31:14.458
I am delighted to meet you,
Number One and Number Two.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.543
I love your stylish clothes.

31:16.627 --> 31:19.546
Where did you get them?
A dead body?

31:19.630 --> 31:20.631
Dead body.

31:20.714 --> 31:21.715
I'm kidding.

31:21.798 --> 31:23.884
Uh... Look, Signor Vespa...

31:26.303 --> 31:27.513
-This guy funny, hmm?
-

31:27.596 --> 31:29.056
I am Ercole Visconti.

31:29.139 --> 31:31.433
Five-time winner of the Portorosso Cup.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.101
The Portorosso what?

31:33.185 --> 31:34.478
The Portorosso Cup!

31:35.646 --> 31:38.315
How do you think
I paid for my beautiful Vespa?

31:40.484 --> 31:41.735
-Hey, stop looking.
-

31:41.818 --> 31:42.819
She's too beautiful for you.

31:43.195 --> 31:45.572
-I, uh...
-

31:45.656 --> 31:47.282
I love it.

31:47.366 --> 31:49.076
The little guy can't even get a word out.

31:49.159 --> 31:52.788
Oof. And he smells like behind
the pescheria.

31:52.871 --> 31:54.540
Hey, my friend smells amazing.

31:54.623 --> 31:56.959
Sorry, sorry. I'll make it up to him.

31:57.042 --> 31:58.919
-Ciccio, Guido.
-

31:59.002 --> 32:00.003
What are you doing?

32:00.087 --> 32:01.088
-ALBERTO: Luca!
-Alberto!

32:01.171 --> 32:02.297
Ah, just a little bath.

32:02.381 --> 32:03.715
-LUCA: Oh, no, no, no!
-It's funny.

32:03.799 --> 32:05.300
-Huh?
-

32:06.927 --> 32:08.345
-No!
-Huh?

32:08.428 --> 32:10.305
Hey! Ercole, basta!

32:10.681 --> 32:13.767
Oh, look who's here. Spewlia.

32:13.851 --> 32:16.019
Wow.
That's how you're training for the race?

32:17.187 --> 32:18.438
Your reign of terror is

32:18.522 --> 32:20.148
-coming to an end!
-ERCOLE: "Coming to an end."

32:20.232 --> 32:21.400
You mean like a year ago?

32:21.483 --> 32:23.068
When you quit in the middle of the race?

32:23.151 --> 32:25.988
Because you couldn't stop
throwing up?

32:26.071 --> 32:28.323
I didn't quit. They made me stop.

32:28.657 --> 32:30.784
I think that is worse. Now, go away.

32:30.868 --> 32:32.244
I'm having fun with my new friends.

32:32.327 --> 32:33.328
They're coming with me.

32:34.204 --> 32:36.999
Hop on. I could use the extra weight.

32:38.166 --> 32:40.711
Fine. Go start a club. For losers!

32:41.879 --> 32:44.506
Maggiore! Another sighting.
In the harbor, this time.

32:44.590 --> 32:46.842
I know. We are setting up a reward.

32:46.925 --> 32:48.927
Someone's gonna win a nice prize.

32:49.011 --> 32:50.637
Me! Me! I win the prizes.

32:50.721 --> 32:51.722
-Ciccio!
-

32:51.805 --> 32:52.848
Get your daddy's harpoon!

32:52.931 --> 32:54.975
We're gonna catch a sea monster.

32:55.058 --> 32:56.185
-Sì!
-

32:56.268 --> 32:58.437
Sto imbecille thinks he can be a jerk

32:58.520 --> 32:59.521
'cause he keeps winning the race,

32:59.605 --> 33:01.106
which he shouldn't even
get to do anymore,

33:01.190 --> 33:03.317
'cause he's too old
and too much of a jerk!

33:04.651 --> 33:06.111
You know, we underdogs

33:06.195 --> 33:07.571
have to look out for each other, right?

33:08.071 --> 33:09.114
What's under the dogs?

33:09.573 --> 33:10.574
Underdogs.

33:10.657 --> 33:12.117
You know, kids who are different,

33:12.201 --> 33:13.202
dressed weird,

33:13.285 --> 33:15.495
or a little sweatier than average.

33:15.579 --> 33:16.663
Uh...

33:16.747 --> 33:18.332
Too much? Too much.

33:18.665 --> 33:20.709
So, are you in town for the race?

33:22.211 --> 33:23.629
The Portorosso Cup?

33:25.506 --> 33:27.049
Well, good talk.

33:27.341 --> 33:30.552
I gotta deliver these.
Always be training, you know?

33:31.929 --> 33:34.640
We should ask her
about this Portorosso Cup race.

33:34.723 --> 33:37.434
That's how the loud scary human said
he got his Vespa.

33:38.810 --> 33:39.811
Giulia!

33:39.895 --> 33:42.231
-Oh!
-

33:42.314 --> 33:43.482
-Uh, grazie.
-Ciao.

33:43.565 --> 33:44.691
Hey, uh, Spewlia?

33:44.775 --> 33:46.902
Giulia. My name is Giulia.

33:47.361 --> 33:51.365
Okay. When you race in a cup,
what do you get?

33:52.115 --> 33:53.867
Soldi. Prize money.

33:54.201 --> 33:55.202
Oh.

33:55.285 --> 33:56.286
Okay.

33:56.370 --> 33:58.121
-No, no! Keep going!
-What? Why?

33:58.205 --> 33:59.206
Ask her about the prize money!

33:59.289 --> 34:00.332
But that stuff is useless.

34:00.415 --> 34:02.000
-Maybe that becomes a Vespa.
-How does that become...

34:02.084 --> 34:03.293
-Just ask her!
-Fine, fine, fine.

34:03.794 --> 34:05.504
-Hello again.
-Ciao.

34:05.587 --> 34:08.382
Can we turn the money into something else?

34:08.966 --> 34:10.717
-Something like...
-That.

34:11.885 --> 34:14.680
Pfft. No. But it could get you that.

34:27.943 --> 34:29.027
BOTH: Whoo-hoo!

34:29.611 --> 34:30.612
It's so beautiful.

34:30.696 --> 34:32.030
Yes, we need it.

34:32.114 --> 34:33.824
Great, so we'll just win the race.

34:35.325 --> 34:36.535
You'll have to beat Ercole.

34:36.702 --> 34:38.078
Okay, so we'll beat Ercole.

34:38.161 --> 34:39.454
Huh. Really?

34:39.538 --> 34:41.498
Thinks he'll beat Ercole,
this guy.

34:41.582 --> 34:43.208
First of all, get in line!

34:43.292 --> 34:46.795
Every summer, that jerk
makes my life miserable.

34:46.879 --> 34:49.715
So, no one's taking him down
unless it's me!

34:50.757 --> 34:52.801
Second, this isn't any old race.

34:52.968 --> 34:56.013
It's an epic, grueling,
traditional Italian triathlon.

34:56.096 --> 34:58.932
Swimming, cycling, and eating pasta.

34:59.183 --> 35:00.225
So, you'd need a teammate.

35:00.309 --> 35:02.978
Well, we'll figure it out.
Thanks, human girl.

35:04.646 --> 35:07.316
Hey, hey, wait. Wait, Alberto.

35:07.816 --> 35:09.151
What if we join her team?

35:09.234 --> 35:10.277
GIULIA: Grazie! Arrivederci!

35:10.360 --> 35:11.987
Hmm. Better idea.

35:12.070 --> 35:13.572
Hey, Spew... Girl!

35:13.655 --> 35:14.740
Santa mozzarella.

35:14.823 --> 35:16.867
Congratulations, you're joining our team.

35:16.950 --> 35:18.827
I race alone.

35:24.082 --> 35:26.460
But we could be under the dogs, too.

35:26.543 --> 35:27.753
Hey, it's okay, Luca.

35:27.836 --> 35:30.214
She'd rather do
the whole race alone again.

35:30.297 --> 35:31.965
Maybe this time
she won't throw up as much.

35:32.049 --> 35:33.467
Uh, hang on.

35:36.011 --> 35:37.971
You wanna be on my team, eh?

35:38.263 --> 35:39.515
Let's see what you got.

35:42.893 --> 35:45.145
-

35:45.229 --> 35:46.355
All right, try jumping onto it.

35:47.356 --> 35:48.357
-No, no, no.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.067
You gotta show it you're the boss!

35:51.944 --> 35:53.487
Santa mozzarella.

35:53.570 --> 35:54.863
-Eyes up.
-LUCA: Huh?

35:54.947 --> 35:57.115
Looking down is what's making you fall.

36:00.035 --> 36:01.036
LUCA: Whoa.

36:01.119 --> 36:02.538
-

36:03.288 --> 36:04.665
Whoa. I'm doing it.

36:06.041 --> 36:07.417
So, can we be on the team?

36:08.836 --> 36:09.920
Can you dodge obstacles?

36:10.003 --> 36:11.922
What if an old lady crosses your path?

36:12.005 --> 36:13.257
-

36:13.340 --> 36:15.926
Can you withstand
passive-aggressive verbal assaults?

36:16.009 --> 36:17.970
"Nice bike,
Number One and Number Two.

36:18.053 --> 36:19.054
"I was kidding.

36:20.973 --> 36:22.057
Finally, can you handle

36:22.140 --> 36:24.351
the course's fiendishly difficult terrain?

36:24.434 --> 36:25.811
Silenzio, Bruno.

36:33.110 --> 36:34.111
Hmm.

36:36.363 --> 36:37.781
Stop. What about you?

36:37.865 --> 36:38.949
Can you swim at least?

36:39.032 --> 36:42.870
bad at swimming.

36:42.953 --> 36:45.330
You can't swim,
you can barely ride a bike.

36:46.874 --> 36:48.667
I mean, where are you even from?

36:48.750 --> 36:50.169
We're not telling you our secrets!

36:50.252 --> 36:52.045
-We're runaways.
-Runaways?

36:52.129 --> 36:53.463
I don't know, ragazzi...

36:54.131 --> 36:55.132
Please?

36:55.424 --> 36:57.926
My family was gonna send me
somewhere horrible.

36:58.010 --> 36:59.845
Away from everything I love.

37:00.012 --> 37:02.389
But if we win this race, well,

37:02.472 --> 37:03.849
we can be free.

37:04.933 --> 37:06.977
My life's great. I'm just helping him out.

37:07.060 --> 37:08.187
Hmm.

37:08.270 --> 37:09.730
Just give me one more chance.

37:10.230 --> 37:11.231
No.

37:11.857 --> 37:13.567
You guys want it just as bad as I do.

37:13.650 --> 37:14.651
You have the hunger.

37:14.735 --> 37:15.944
That's the most important thing.

37:16.111 --> 37:17.446
I'm definitely hungry.

37:17.529 --> 37:20.324
Perfetto! You eat, you bike, and I swim.

37:20.407 --> 37:22.701
-GIULIA: Underdogs?

37:23.660 --> 37:24.953
ALBERTO AND LUCA: Underdogs.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.623
Now we just need money for the entry fee.

37:27.789 --> 37:29.291
From my dad.

37:38.550 --> 37:41.637
All right, just let me do the talking
and act casual.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.180
He doesn't do well with fear.

37:43.263 --> 37:44.723
Hey, Papà! I brought

37:44.806 --> 37:46.183
-some friends for dinner.
-

37:46.266 --> 37:47.851
-Is there enough for four?
-

37:50.646 --> 37:51.813
-Whoa.

37:51.897 --> 37:53.649
What's wrong with you, stu...

38:01.323 --> 38:02.908
What do you think he kills with those?

38:03.867 --> 38:06.245
-MASSIMO: Anything that swims.
-

38:06.328 --> 38:08.038
Hai visto il giornale today?

38:08.121 --> 38:10.165
That photo is a fake, Papà.

38:10.832 --> 38:14.086
Everyone in Portorosso
pretends to believe in sea monsters.

38:14.586 --> 38:16.505
-ALBERTO: Huh.

38:16.588 --> 38:18.674
MASSIMO: Well, I'm not pretending.

38:20.676 --> 38:21.885
-Huh?

38:32.354 --> 38:33.689
Slipped.

38:35.440 --> 38:36.441
Eh.

38:37.860 --> 38:38.902
BOTH: Phew!

38:41.822 --> 38:42.948
MASSIMO: Dinner's ready.

38:43.365 --> 38:44.992
Trenette al pesto.

39:08.182 --> 39:09.266
Mmm!

39:13.228 --> 39:14.229
Uh...

39:14.897 --> 39:15.898
LUCA: Mmm!

39:17.357 --> 39:18.358
Okay.

39:19.693 --> 39:22.154
Where did you boys say you were from?

39:24.031 --> 39:26.575
They're, uh,
classmates. From Genova.

39:26.658 --> 39:28.368
Luca and, uh...

39:28.452 --> 39:30.287
Alberto.
-Alberto.

39:30.996 --> 39:33.498
And what brings you to Portorosso?

39:33.582 --> 39:34.666
GIULIA: Oh. Uh...

39:34.750 --> 39:36.043
Funny you should ask.

39:36.126 --> 39:37.336
They came for the race.

39:38.003 --> 39:39.087
The race?

39:39.254 --> 39:40.464
Yeah.

39:40.547 --> 39:43.175
Uh, you know what? Don't worry about it.

39:43.258 --> 39:45.135
"Don't worry about it"?

39:45.511 --> 39:47.513
Mm-hmm. Don't worry about it.

39:47.596 --> 39:50.766
Giulietta. A word.

39:52.559 --> 39:54.478
I don't want you doing the race again.

39:54.561 --> 39:55.729
You get so upset.

39:55.812 --> 39:58.273
Papà, per favore, I have a team now.

39:58.357 --> 40:01.360
There's also the entry fee.
Money is tight.

40:01.443 --> 40:03.570
I'll work double shifts at the pescheria.
Whatever you need.

40:03.654 --> 40:05.989
I can't sell what I don't have.

40:06.073 --> 40:08.408
What I need is more fish in my net.

40:10.786 --> 40:12.412
LUCA: Um, excuse me?

40:12.496 --> 40:13.872
We could help.

40:13.956 --> 40:15.374
You know fish?

40:15.457 --> 40:17.292
Oh, we? We know lots of fish.

40:17.376 --> 40:19.545
-MASSIMO: Huh.
-Can this face lose?

40:21.421 --> 40:24.258
You want to work? I'll put you to work.

40:25.926 --> 40:27.636
Oh, grazie, Papà.

40:27.719 --> 40:29.471
-

40:30.889 --> 40:33.141
Don't you...

40:33.225 --> 40:35.644
-No! Machiavelli!
-

40:38.063 --> 40:39.773
I'm so sorry about the cat.

40:39.857 --> 40:41.358
I don't know what got into him.

40:41.441 --> 40:44.319
It's fine. We're gonna head back to, uh...

40:44.862 --> 40:45.863
Oh!

40:45.946 --> 40:48.574
Do you guys need a place to stay?

40:50.200 --> 40:51.243
Cool.

40:51.410 --> 40:53.829
Oops! Sorry. This is my...

40:53.912 --> 40:54.913
Your hideout.

40:55.330 --> 40:57.666
Huh. Yeah. My hideout.

41:00.294 --> 41:01.295
Whoa!

41:01.378 --> 41:02.504
-

41:02.588 --> 41:05.299
Slipped.
Uh, see you in the morning.

41:07.342 --> 41:08.844
That was close.
-I know.

41:08.927 --> 41:10.762
Like, how big was that dad human?

41:10.846 --> 41:12.347
That guy kills things, for sure.

41:12.431 --> 41:14.266
I thought we were gonna die,
like, a hundred times.

41:14.349 --> 41:15.350
Hey, relax.

41:15.434 --> 41:17.186
We're incredible at this humaning stuff.

41:17.269 --> 41:19.146
Yeah. You're right.

41:19.229 --> 41:20.564
Did you see me on the bike?

41:20.647 --> 41:21.773
Giulia said, "Look up,"

41:21.857 --> 41:23.192
and then all of a sudden, I was riding it.

41:23.275 --> 41:24.735
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Our Vespa's gonna be

41:24.818 --> 41:26.570
even better than a bike, though.

41:26.653 --> 41:29.031
Because the moment we get it,
we're outta here.

41:50.052 --> 41:51.512
How could my mother tell him

41:51.595 --> 41:53.722
about this town of bloodthirsty lunatics?

41:53.805 --> 41:55.891
I still can't believe he would do this.

41:55.974 --> 41:56.975
It's not like him.

41:57.059 --> 41:58.227
Just keep your guard up.

41:58.310 --> 41:59.728
There's gonna be land monsters everywhere.

41:59.811 --> 42:01.522
-

42:01.605 --> 42:04.566
-Daniela! Ooh! Wait! Ow! Ow!
-No! Not today, land monster!

42:04.650 --> 42:06.151
-It's me!
-Oh!

42:06.235 --> 42:07.736
You scared the scales off of me!

42:07.819 --> 42:09.112
Jeez, you're strong!

42:09.196 --> 42:10.489
I'm sorry, I'm just a little on edge.

42:10.572 --> 42:13.492
No. I needed that. It really woke me up.

42:13.659 --> 42:16.495
Wow! We look horrifying.

42:16.578 --> 42:18.038
Ugh, gross.

42:18.121 --> 42:19.915
Come on. Let's find our son.

42:19.998 --> 42:21.375
-

42:36.181 --> 42:39.059
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Alberto! Wake up!

42:39.142 --> 42:40.978
What? Ahh! The sky's been leaking!

42:54.199 --> 42:56.076
Hmm. Uh...

42:56.159 --> 42:57.411
Oh. There you are!

42:57.703 --> 42:59.246
Buongiorno.

42:59.329 --> 43:00.455
All right, ragazzi.

43:00.539 --> 43:02.499
You want that entry fee,
you got to earn it.

43:02.583 --> 43:03.584
-Giulietta...
-I'm on it!

43:03.667 --> 43:06.044
-...you make the deliveries.
-Already makin' 'em! Ciao!

43:06.128 --> 43:08.213
Hmm. You two are coming with me.

43:08.297 --> 43:09.298
-LUCA: Oh.
-

43:09.381 --> 43:11.175
Which knife do I get? Huh? Huh?

43:11.258 --> 43:12.551
You don't.

43:14.344 --> 43:15.721
TOMMASO: Buongiorno, Massimo!

43:15.804 --> 43:18.390
You'll keep an eye out
for those sea monsters, right?

43:18.473 --> 43:19.850
We're all counting on you.

43:19.933 --> 43:22.978
Don't worry, Tommaso.
I've got my eyes peeled.

43:23.061 --> 43:24.479
They won't get away.

43:25.939 --> 43:27.399
-

43:30.527 --> 43:31.904
-

43:33.822 --> 43:35.866
Hey, this isn't a joyride.

43:35.949 --> 43:37.367
Make yourselves useful.

43:44.625 --> 43:45.626
Uh...

43:47.586 --> 43:48.712
-

43:48.795 --> 43:50.339
-

43:50.422 --> 43:52.674
MASSIMO: Hey,
no goofing around back there.

43:52.758 --> 43:53.967
-

43:54.051 --> 43:55.677
-

44:14.863 --> 44:16.490
A sea monster ate it.

44:16.865 --> 44:17.991
Huh? What?

44:18.492 --> 44:22.496
Ma, no.
This is how I came into the world.

44:27.876 --> 44:28.877
Whoa.

44:28.961 --> 44:31.630
Mannaggia, not a great catch today.

44:31.713 --> 44:35.175
It might be because we're
over a haunted fish graveyard.

44:35.259 --> 44:38.136
We know it's not haunted.
The fish think it's haunted.

44:38.220 --> 44:41.890
This time of day, most fish
will be right about there.

44:43.183 --> 44:44.309
MASSIMO: Hmm.

44:46.103 --> 44:47.563
BOTH: Ciao, Giulia.
GIULIA: Ciao.

44:49.982 --> 44:51.149
Ha-ha!

44:51.233 --> 44:52.526
New personal best!

44:52.985 --> 44:54.987
Santo pecorino.

44:55.070 --> 44:56.280
ALBERTO: Shoo! Shoo!

44:58.407 --> 45:00.868
Your friends do know fish.

45:01.118 --> 45:04.079
Benissimo!
Ooh, let's go sign up.

45:10.836 --> 45:11.879
Okay. Okay.

45:11.962 --> 45:13.797
Now, what's our plan? Think, Daniela.

45:13.881 --> 45:15.841
Hey, everything's always on you.

45:15.924 --> 45:17.176
I wanna step up.

45:17.259 --> 45:20.971
-Uh... You sure?
-Oh, yeah. I got this.

45:22.848 --> 45:25.184
Oh, hello there, young man.

45:25.267 --> 45:27.186
-You're not fooling anyone.
-Lorenzo, eh-eh.

45:27.269 --> 45:29.313
Did you really think
you could get away with this?

45:29.396 --> 45:31.523
-Renzo...
-You thought we wouldn't find you?

45:31.607 --> 45:32.858
-Well, guess what?
-I don't think...

45:32.941 --> 45:34.776
It's time for us to go home.

45:44.077 --> 45:46.371
Let that be a lesson to you!

45:46.455 --> 45:48.624
Go, go, go! Run before
its mother gets here!

45:49.583 --> 45:51.168
It turns out I don't got this.

45:51.251 --> 45:54.338
No, but I do. I'll know my son when I...

45:57.341 --> 45:58.550
...see him.

45:59.051 --> 46:00.260
Ah, sharks.

46:00.344 --> 46:03.096
Grazie, Papà!
Come on, we'd better hurry.

46:03.180 --> 46:05.098
-ALBERTO: Okay.
-

46:07.392 --> 46:08.644
WOMAN: Fellow Portorossans!

46:09.228 --> 46:11.730
It is I, Giorgio Giorgioni!

46:11.897 --> 46:16.527
Slayer of sea monsters
and beloved purveyor of pasta!

46:16.610 --> 46:18.153
Slayer of sea monsters?

46:18.237 --> 46:20.239
Ah, that's just Signora Marsigliese.

46:20.322 --> 46:22.115
She works for the sponsor for the race.

46:22.199 --> 46:24.076
This is gonna take forever.

46:24.159 --> 46:25.744
The finest pasta in Liguria

46:25.827 --> 46:27.871
at a price every family can afford.

46:27.955 --> 46:29.248
Get to the rules!

46:29.331 --> 46:32.209
Enthusiasm. Love to see it.

46:32.292 --> 46:34.002
To win my famous race,

46:34.086 --> 46:36.421
your team must be the first to brave

46:36.505 --> 46:38.215
the treacherous waters of the bay,

46:38.298 --> 46:40.926
devour a mystery bowl
of my delicious pasta,

46:41.009 --> 46:44.555
and ride to the top
of Mount Portorosso and back!

46:44.638 --> 46:46.223
That all sounds pretty hard.

46:46.306 --> 46:49.142
Yeah. Hard to lose. We're going to win.

46:49.226 --> 46:50.310
I love your confidence.

46:50.394 --> 46:52.062
But don't forget, we're going
to have to go through...

46:52.145 --> 46:53.522
Champion coming through.

46:53.605 --> 46:55.232
-GIULIA: Ugh.
-Ciao, ciao! Hey!

46:55.315 --> 46:56.316
Ercole.

46:56.817 --> 46:58.652
Aren't you a little old, Ercole?

46:58.735 --> 47:00.445
Signora! I am 16.

47:00.529 --> 47:01.947
You said that last year.

47:02.030 --> 47:03.407
But this year, it's true.

47:03.824 --> 47:05.951
You might want to
save your money, ragazzi.

47:06.034 --> 47:08.120
This year, Ercole's gonna
break the record

47:08.203 --> 47:09.997
and make it six in a row.

47:10.080 --> 47:12.541
Oh, no. I don't believe it.

47:12.624 --> 47:15.210
Spewlia, you teamed up
with these vagrants?

47:15.294 --> 47:16.461
-Ignore him.

47:16.545 --> 47:17.838
Oh, I wish for you that you could.

47:17.921 --> 47:20.340
I'm afraid your friends still need to pay

47:20.424 --> 47:22.009
the out-of-town weirdo tax.

47:24.052 --> 47:26.221
Hey! Ercole!
You have to give it back!

47:26.305 --> 47:27.973
Ercole doesn't have to do anything.

47:28.056 --> 47:29.808
He's the Portorosso Cup champion,
number one.

47:29.892 --> 47:30.893
And number two,

47:30.976 --> 47:32.436
his life is amazing
and everyone loves him.

47:32.519 --> 47:34.938
They don't love you.
They're afraid of you.

47:35.022 --> 47:37.024
Raise your hand
if you love me.

47:37.274 --> 47:38.734
See? Everyone.

47:38.817 --> 47:40.402
Even you. Bop!

47:40.485 --> 47:42.070
Oh, that's it. Come on, Luca.

47:42.154 --> 47:44.031
Hey! The vagrants want to fight.

47:45.199 --> 47:46.867
-Alberto?
-Silenzio, Bruno.

47:46.950 --> 47:48.619
Remember, this is for our Vespa.

47:48.702 --> 47:49.995
-Stop.
-A Vespa?

47:51.163 --> 47:52.748
Trash like you can't ride Vespas.

47:52.831 --> 47:56.168
Ercole, you're just afraid
we're gonna put an end to your

47:56.251 --> 47:58.003
-evil empire of injustice.
-"Evil empire of injustice."

47:58.086 --> 47:59.546
Got anything new?

47:59.630 --> 48:02.966
Yeah. Here's a new one.
You look like a, uh... Uh...

48:03.050 --> 48:04.968
-A catfish.
-A catfish!

48:05.052 --> 48:06.428
CROWD: Huh?

48:07.596 --> 48:08.597
Uh, they're bottom-feeders,

48:08.680 --> 48:10.349
and they also have
two sad little whiskers.

48:10.432 --> 48:12.476
-

48:12.559 --> 48:13.685
-Shut up!

48:16.188 --> 48:17.689
Listen, piccoletto,

48:17.940 --> 48:20.651
I eat kids like you for breakfast.

48:20.734 --> 48:23.654
I dunk them in my cioccolata and...

48:23.737 --> 48:25.280
...finiti!

48:25.364 --> 48:27.074
-

48:27.157 --> 48:29.076
So, here, sign up. Mm?

48:29.159 --> 48:31.703
I'll make it my mission to destroy you.

48:31.787 --> 48:34.957
It's gonna be some race, huh?

48:35.415 --> 48:37.960
Sorry, no autographs today.

48:38.043 --> 48:39.628
-You can put your hand down.
-

48:40.462 --> 48:43.924
Ha-ha! Luca! Bravo, we did it!

48:46.468 --> 48:47.511
Giulia Marcovaldo.

48:47.594 --> 48:49.429
Ciao, Giulia. Team of one?

48:49.513 --> 48:50.764
Not today.

48:50.931 --> 48:53.475
-Luca Paguro.
-Alberto Scorfano.

48:54.142 --> 48:56.645
GIULIA: Okay, ragazzi,
we have one week to train.

48:59.022 --> 49:00.065
I got this.

49:00.399 --> 49:01.441
Wait, what?

49:01.525 --> 49:03.110
Every year they change the pasta.

49:03.193 --> 49:04.820
You have to be ready for anything.

49:04.903 --> 49:09.116
Could be cannelloni, penne,
fusilli, trofie, even lasagne.

49:10.033 --> 49:13.245
And you have to use a forchetta.
It's the rule.

49:27.968 --> 49:30.429
Holy carp. No. I can't.

49:32.973 --> 49:35.100
And remember, piccoletto...

49:37.102 --> 49:40.480
Forza, Luca, don't let him get
in your head. You can do this.

49:40.564 --> 49:43.859
Okay. Silenzio, Bruno. Here we go.

49:43.942 --> 49:46.195
I can't!

49:48.363 --> 49:49.406
-

49:54.745 --> 49:56.830
I guess that's how humans swim?

49:56.914 --> 49:58.498
Ugh, that's embarrassing.

49:59.458 --> 50:00.584
Any sea monsters?

50:06.632 --> 50:08.759
GIULIA: Oh, no! It's Ercole! Go, go!

50:09.426 --> 50:11.261
ALBERTO: Luca! Faster, faster!
LUCA: Why aren't we moving?

50:11.845 --> 50:13.222
-Ercole?
-

50:14.515 --> 50:15.557
-

50:18.018 --> 50:19.186
-Guido!
-I... I slipped.

50:19.269 --> 50:20.521
Ciccio, slap Guido.

50:20.771 --> 50:22.022
Again. Like you mean it.

50:25.484 --> 50:26.777
-Huh?
-

50:27.778 --> 50:29.446
Hmm. Where did the other one go?

50:31.657 --> 50:33.325
-GIULIA: Ercole!

50:33.408 --> 50:35.494
-

50:36.662 --> 50:39.665
Giulia! It is wool. It cannot get wet!

50:39.748 --> 50:41.750
Ciccio, make it dry, subito!

50:41.834 --> 50:44.002
-GIULIA: Luca? Alberto?

50:44.378 --> 50:45.462
Are you okay?

50:45.546 --> 50:46.964
-Um...
-We're good! Good, good, good.

50:47.047 --> 50:49.091
GIULIA: Well, I think that's
enough training for today.

50:49.174 --> 50:50.592
-LUCA: Yeah. Agreed.
-Yup.

50:51.301 --> 50:54.930
Ah, Ciccio! The motor!
They are slowly getting away!

50:55.013 --> 50:56.014
-

50:56.098 --> 50:57.307
Guido, slap Ciccio.

50:58.475 --> 51:00.018
-With contempt!
-

51:01.645 --> 51:03.105
-KID: Huh?
-Hmm.

51:09.319 --> 51:10.320
Kick it.

51:10.946 --> 51:12.322
-

51:13.115 --> 51:14.116
Oh!

51:15.576 --> 51:16.869
I have an idea.

51:16.952 --> 51:17.953
Uh-uh. Honey?

51:18.036 --> 51:19.872
Hey, guys! Can I play, too?

51:19.955 --> 51:20.956
-Oops, sorry!

51:22.165 --> 51:23.584
Oh. Okay.

51:24.751 --> 51:25.836
-Get the ball!
-

51:25.919 --> 51:26.920
Come and get it!

51:27.838 --> 51:29.131
-Uh-uh!
-

51:30.007 --> 51:31.592
-Not our kid, not our kid.

51:32.342 --> 51:34.344
-

51:38.891 --> 51:40.475
-

51:42.561 --> 51:44.021
-Ha-ha!

51:44.605 --> 51:46.273
-

51:47.816 --> 51:50.694
Let's see Bianca Branzino do that!

51:51.945 --> 51:52.946
GIULIA: Good effort, team.

51:53.030 --> 51:54.031
You've earned your pasta tonight.

51:54.114 --> 51:55.115
ALBERTO:
Can I please eat with my hands?

51:55.199 --> 51:56.200
DANIELA: Where could he be?

51:56.283 --> 51:58.285
LORENZO: Well, at least you won. I think.

51:58.368 --> 51:59.995
Yeah, I guess I did.

52:00.078 --> 52:01.872
Come on. We just gotta keep looking.

52:07.503 --> 52:08.587
Uh...

52:08.670 --> 52:11.673
Alberto? I think
I might've seen my parents.

52:11.757 --> 52:14.009
No way. I told you,
they're not coming here.

52:14.092 --> 52:15.427
But what if they did?

52:15.511 --> 52:16.720
They're gonna send me to the deep.

52:16.803 --> 52:18.680
Listen, relax. It's never gonna happen.

52:18.764 --> 52:19.765
All right, boys.

52:19.848 --> 52:22.017
Pretty good today,
but let's talk technique.

52:22.100 --> 52:24.811
Hey, ragazzi! I need some help
with the nets.

52:24.895 --> 52:27.272
You. The big, strong one.

52:27.356 --> 52:28.649
-Andiamo.
-I'll be right back.

52:33.987 --> 52:35.447
Hey, we're gonna win.

52:35.614 --> 52:37.491
And you'll get your Vespa.

52:37.908 --> 52:39.618
Why do you want a Vespa, again?

52:39.701 --> 52:41.537
Oh. Because it'll be amazing.

52:41.620 --> 52:44.498
Every day, me and Alberto
are gonna ride someplace new.

52:44.581 --> 52:47.125
And every night,
we'll sleep under the fish.

52:47.209 --> 52:50.170
Good.

52:50.254 --> 52:52.589
How about you?
What'll you do when you win?

52:52.673 --> 52:54.883
I'll get up
in front of everyone

52:54.967 --> 52:56.969
and say, "Told you I'd win!"

52:57.052 --> 52:58.303
Yeah.

52:58.679 --> 52:59.888
And then what?

53:00.055 --> 53:01.473
Well, that's it.

53:01.557 --> 53:02.766
Look, during school,

53:02.850 --> 53:04.726
I live with my mamma in Genova.

53:04.810 --> 53:06.603
And every summer, I come here,

53:06.687 --> 53:09.273
and everyone thinks
I'm just some weird kid

53:09.356 --> 53:10.899
who doesn't belong.

53:12.484 --> 53:13.819
I think I know how you feel.

53:13.902 --> 53:15.821
Right? That's why we gotta win.

53:15.904 --> 53:17.239
The town will cheer our names.

53:20.450 --> 53:21.702
Sorry. Too much?

53:21.785 --> 53:23.787
My mom says sometimes I'm too much.

53:23.871 --> 53:25.664
No way. Not for me.

53:27.249 --> 53:29.793
You know those aren't fish, right?

53:29.877 --> 53:33.046
Of course they are.
Alberto told me all about it.

53:33.547 --> 53:34.548
Come with me.

53:41.638 --> 53:43.140
-

53:57.070 --> 53:58.447
This is a telescope.

53:58.614 --> 54:00.616
Old man Bernardi lets me use it.

54:00.699 --> 54:03.869
It makes faraway things seem close. Look.

54:07.748 --> 54:09.333
GIULIA: See any fish?

54:09.416 --> 54:10.876
Then what are all those?

54:10.959 --> 54:12.669
Stars. Like the sun.

54:12.753 --> 54:14.922
Giant, raging balls of fire!

54:15.088 --> 54:17.007
So, Alberto was wrong.

54:17.090 --> 54:19.092
And stars are circled by planets.

54:22.638 --> 54:23.639
Look.

54:24.640 --> 54:26.517
That's Saturno. It's my favorite.

54:26.600 --> 54:28.435
It's the lightest of the planets.

54:28.519 --> 54:31.438
They say if there was an ocean
big enough to hold it,

54:31.522 --> 54:32.731
it would float in it!

54:32.814 --> 54:34.024
Whoa!

54:36.276 --> 54:37.277
Wow!

54:42.658 --> 54:44.034
GIULIA: Come on, Luca!

55:11.436 --> 55:12.521
LUCA: So, this is how machines fly?

55:12.604 --> 55:13.605
GIULIA: Sì.

55:13.689 --> 55:15.232
LUCA: And there are big towns
called cities?

55:15.315 --> 55:16.316
GIULIA: Sì.

55:16.400 --> 55:17.609
Like even bigger than Portorosso?

55:17.693 --> 55:19.862
Like Genova! Literally 20 times bigger.

55:19.945 --> 55:21.905
And we're all on a big round rock,

55:21.989 --> 55:23.282
floating around a star

55:23.365 --> 55:25.325
in the "solar system"?

55:25.409 --> 55:26.785
So cool, right?

55:26.869 --> 55:28.996
And is there anything
beyond the solar system?

55:29.079 --> 55:31.540
Only a galaxy full of solar systems.

55:31.623 --> 55:34.168
-Then what?
-A universe full of galaxies!

55:34.251 --> 55:36.044
And then what?

55:36.128 --> 55:37.462
And then...

55:37.796 --> 55:38.839
I don't know.

55:38.922 --> 55:40.883
But next year in Advanced Astronomy,

55:40.966 --> 55:42.593
I'm gonna use my school's telescope.

55:42.676 --> 55:43.844
So, maybe I'll find out.

55:44.136 --> 55:47.055
That thing's huge.
I wish I could show it to you.

55:47.139 --> 55:49.725
Just promise you'll tell me
everything you see!

55:50.100 --> 55:51.602
Sorry. Too much?

55:51.685 --> 55:53.020
Never.

55:54.188 --> 55:56.106
Hey, Luca, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

55:56.190 --> 55:58.400
-LUCA: Oh, sorry.
-Just come on. Let's go.

55:58.567 --> 56:01.862
Could I maybe borrow this?
Just for tonight.

56:04.156 --> 56:05.449
GIULIA: You can have it.

56:07.201 --> 56:08.327
Ha-ha!

56:08.994 --> 56:11.788
The universe is literally yours!

56:11.872 --> 56:13.332
Wow. Thank you!

56:13.415 --> 56:14.458
Luca!

56:14.541 --> 56:15.751
LUCA: Okay.

56:20.714 --> 56:21.715
LUCA: Where are we going?

56:21.798 --> 56:23.342
ALBERTO: Come on.
I got something to show you.

56:23.800 --> 56:27.095
Hey, you won't believe this.
Those aren't fish.

56:27.179 --> 56:28.222
-What?
-Yeah.

56:28.305 --> 56:29.681
Giulia explained it to me.

56:29.765 --> 56:30.766
They're fires.

56:30.849 --> 56:33.143
But, like, one million times bigger.

56:33.227 --> 56:34.937
Uh, no, they're not.

56:38.065 --> 56:41.026
Soon you'll be ours, sweet Vespa.

56:41.193 --> 56:42.194
Take a look.

56:42.277 --> 56:44.238
I thought of every
single thing we're gonna need.

56:44.321 --> 56:45.572
Also, I added flames.

56:46.073 --> 56:47.533
That's so cool!

56:47.950 --> 56:50.536
Oh! And we can bring
a telescope, too!

56:50.619 --> 56:52.704
Yeah! That shoots lightning!

56:52.788 --> 56:53.789
LUCA: No, no, no.

56:53.956 --> 56:55.457
You look through it.

56:55.791 --> 56:58.877
Giulia says there's an even
bigger one at her school.

56:59.086 --> 57:00.963
Wait. What if we visit her there?

57:01.046 --> 57:02.840
Why would you wanna do that?

57:02.923 --> 57:04.633
It kinda sounds interesting.

57:04.716 --> 57:07.344
The whole reason we're getting a Vespa
is to live on our own.

57:07.427 --> 57:10.013
We don't need school.
We don't need anybody.

57:10.097 --> 57:12.057
Couldn't we just try it?

57:12.140 --> 57:13.684
Just for a few days?

57:13.767 --> 57:16.353
Luca, sea monsters can't go to school.

57:16.436 --> 57:17.896
What do you think is gonna happen

57:17.980 --> 57:19.398
when they see your fish face?

57:22.693 --> 57:24.570
ERCOLE: Hey, look who it is.

57:24.653 --> 57:26.822
And with no Giulia to hide behind.

57:26.905 --> 57:28.532
-Come on. Let's go.
-No.

57:28.615 --> 57:30.534
Something's fishy with you two.

57:30.617 --> 57:32.202
-I mean, besides the smell.
-

57:32.286 --> 57:33.495
You're hiding something.

57:33.745 --> 57:35.664
Is it that we're smarter than you?

57:35.747 --> 57:37.749
I mean, we're not really hiding that.

57:37.833 --> 57:39.209
It's just kind of obvious.

57:39.293 --> 57:41.420
You know, people think I'm a nice guy.

57:41.503 --> 57:43.005
Always joking around.

57:43.088 --> 57:45.340
But really, I'm not.

57:45.424 --> 57:47.467
-Stop!
-Wait your turn, piccoletto.

57:47.551 --> 57:49.970
I want to make myself very clear.

57:50.053 --> 57:51.555
This is my town,

57:51.638 --> 57:52.764
-number one...
-

57:52.848 --> 57:56.476
...and number two, I don't want you in it.

57:56.894 --> 57:58.353
I... I said stop!

57:58.729 --> 58:01.815
Put that down, piccoletto.
You'll hurt yourself.

58:01.899 --> 58:03.150
-LUCA: Let him go!
-

58:05.319 --> 58:08.739
Go. Now. Before I change my mind.

58:09.323 --> 58:13.035
Nobody wants you here, idioti!
Keep running!

58:15.954 --> 58:18.540
Why did you make him mad?
We should've left.

58:18.624 --> 58:20.042
No, no, no. We're fine.

58:20.417 --> 58:21.919
I had it under control.

58:22.085 --> 58:25.172
All you gotta do
is follow my lead, remember?

58:35.224 --> 58:36.725
-Rise and shine!

58:38.602 --> 58:41.063
Go, go! Go, Alberto! Go!

58:54.993 --> 58:56.703
-Nope. Whoa...
-

59:01.792 --> 59:03.085
-MASSIMO: Buongiorno!
-

59:13.262 --> 59:14.346
Whew.

59:19.351 --> 59:20.352
DANIELA: Wha...

59:20.435 --> 59:21.520
LORENZO: Ugo?

59:27.568 --> 59:28.944
-Rise and shine!
-

59:29.027 --> 59:30.904
Only two days till the race.

59:31.196 --> 59:32.197
Hmm.

59:33.782 --> 59:34.992
Espresso.

59:40.122 --> 59:41.248
Go, Luca!

59:41.331 --> 59:42.332
Go, go!

59:42.583 --> 59:44.084
-Hey, don't cheer for him!
-

59:45.252 --> 59:47.171
Ha-ha! Whoo!

59:48.213 --> 59:50.215
This is fun!

59:50.299 --> 59:52.050
-Uh...

59:52.676 --> 59:53.719
MASSIMO: Hmm.

59:57.097 --> 59:58.098
Mm?

1:00:01.268 --> 1:00:02.519
Huh. Hey!

1:00:02.603 --> 1:00:04.313
That's amazing!

1:00:05.522 --> 1:00:06.732
-LUCA: Oh, wow!
-

1:00:11.320 --> 1:00:13.155
-

1:00:13.238 --> 1:00:16.533
I don't know, Lorenzo.
Was I too hard on him?

1:00:16.617 --> 1:00:19.953
No. You were just trying
to keep him safe.

1:00:20.245 --> 1:00:21.330
It's my fault.

1:00:21.413 --> 1:00:24.458
I wasn't paying enough attention to him.

1:00:24.541 --> 1:00:27.753
But I was the one who tried
to send him away.

1:00:27.836 --> 1:00:29.922
I just never in a million years

1:00:30.005 --> 1:00:31.340
would have thought he'd do this.

1:00:31.423 --> 1:00:32.424
It's like I don't even know...

1:00:32.508 --> 1:00:33.509
GIULIA: You can do it, Luca!

1:00:34.426 --> 1:00:35.719
...who he is!

1:00:35.802 --> 1:00:37.095
-GIULIA: Go, go!

1:00:37.179 --> 1:00:38.430
DANIELA: Luca!
LORENZO: Luca!

1:00:38.972 --> 1:00:39.973
DANIELA: Luca, stop!

1:00:41.308 --> 1:00:42.309
Luca!

1:00:45.145 --> 1:00:46.313
Where are we going?

1:00:46.396 --> 1:00:47.940
Uh... A shortcut.

1:00:48.023 --> 1:00:50.442
Steeper, rough terrain... I like it.

1:00:50.609 --> 1:00:52.236
Why aren't you training?

1:00:52.402 --> 1:00:54.238
I'm always training.

1:01:00.285 --> 1:01:03.372
Bravo, Luca. That was your fastest yet.

1:01:03.455 --> 1:01:04.915
-Ooh, guys, look!

1:01:05.249 --> 1:01:06.708
That's the train to Genova.

1:01:06.792 --> 1:01:08.085
LUCA: That goes to your school?

1:01:08.168 --> 1:01:09.169
-Yeah.
-

1:01:09.253 --> 1:01:10.879
I was wondering, actually,

1:01:10.963 --> 1:01:13.590
is your school open to everyone?

1:01:13.674 --> 1:01:16.510
Well, it costs a little money,
but I guess.

1:01:16.593 --> 1:01:17.928
Great. Thank you, Giulia,

1:01:18.011 --> 1:01:19.638
for showing us the boring thing

1:01:19.721 --> 1:01:21.265
that takes us to the terrible place.

1:01:21.348 --> 1:01:23.225
Now, can we focus on what matters?

1:01:23.308 --> 1:01:26.103
If we lose this race,
we're not going anywhere.

1:01:26.311 --> 1:01:28.856
Santa mozzarella. The downhill.

1:01:28.939 --> 1:01:29.940
I know it looks scary.

1:01:30.023 --> 1:01:31.024
But here's what you need to know...

1:01:31.108 --> 1:01:32.234
Would you stop bossing him around?

1:01:32.317 --> 1:01:33.318
What is your problem?

1:01:33.402 --> 1:01:35.529
I'm his friend. I know what he needs.

1:01:35.612 --> 1:01:37.197
Oh, yeah?
Well, then, what does he need?

1:01:37.281 --> 1:01:39.992
Me. We'll just ride it
like we did on the island. Together.

1:01:40.742 --> 1:01:41.910
-Andiamo.
-No!

1:01:42.369 --> 1:01:43.579
Alberto, stop!

1:01:43.662 --> 1:01:44.997
That's Bruno talking!

1:01:45.080 --> 1:01:47.666
LUCA: No! I'm pretty sure that's just me!

1:01:47.749 --> 1:01:49.543
-

1:01:53.005 --> 1:01:54.339
-Stop, Alberto!
-Let it go!

1:01:54.423 --> 1:01:55.424
LUCA: Look out!

1:02:02.181 --> 1:02:04.683
Porca paletta, what was that?

1:02:04.766 --> 1:02:05.767
CICCIO: Huh?

1:02:05.851 --> 1:02:08.437
Bah! Not now, Ciccio! Eyes on the water!

1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:10.022
-Move, move!
-Okay.

1:02:13.192 --> 1:02:15.944
Oh, no!
Luca! Alberto!

1:02:16.445 --> 1:02:18.113
She'll see us. Come on!

1:02:22.826 --> 1:02:25.120
Look, I was just trying to
show you how to do it right.

1:02:25.204 --> 1:02:26.747
You don't know how to do it right!

1:02:26.830 --> 1:02:28.165
I got us down the hill, didn't I?

1:02:28.248 --> 1:02:30.334
You crashed! Into the sea!

1:02:30.417 --> 1:02:31.502
ALBERTO: It's fine.

1:02:31.585 --> 1:02:34.254
Nothing's fine! My parents just saw me!

1:02:34.338 --> 1:02:35.756
Luca, your parents aren't here.

1:02:35.839 --> 1:02:37.424
You don't know what you're talking about!

1:02:37.508 --> 1:02:39.343
Look, this town is making you crazy.

1:02:39.426 --> 1:02:41.970
We just need to win that Vespa
and get outta here.

1:02:42.429 --> 1:02:44.389
It's not gonna be any different.

1:02:44.723 --> 1:02:46.058
I don't wanna...

1:02:49.186 --> 1:02:50.687
I wanna go to school.

1:02:50.854 --> 1:02:53.232
That again? We can't go to school.

1:02:53.315 --> 1:02:54.691
You're just afraid you can't do it.

1:02:54.775 --> 1:02:56.235
I'm not afraid.

1:02:56.318 --> 1:02:57.569
You're the one who gets afraid.

1:02:57.653 --> 1:02:58.946
Shut up!

1:03:01.448 --> 1:03:02.449
-Ow!

1:03:03.784 --> 1:03:05.244
What happens when she sees you?

1:03:05.327 --> 1:03:06.328
When anyone sees you?

1:03:07.829 --> 1:03:09.748
You're alive!

1:03:13.710 --> 1:03:16.088
Hey! You're never allowed
on my bike again.

1:03:16.171 --> 1:03:17.840
Stick to food, big guy.

1:03:20.551 --> 1:03:22.678
Uh, what's going on?

1:03:22.761 --> 1:03:24.054
Nothing. Let's just get back to training.

1:03:24.137 --> 1:03:26.390
Actually, we have something to ask you.

1:03:26.473 --> 1:03:27.599
We were wondering

1:03:27.683 --> 1:03:29.643
if we could come with you to your school?

1:03:30.477 --> 1:03:33.772
Santo pecorino! That's the best idea ever!

1:03:40.487 --> 1:03:42.406
Uh, Giulia, your school,

1:03:42.489 --> 1:03:44.449
does it take all kinds of people?

1:03:44.908 --> 1:03:47.244
I mean, what if some of them
were not human?

1:03:47.327 --> 1:03:48.412
Alberto...

1:03:48.495 --> 1:03:52.082
What if some were, oh,
I don't know, sea monsters?

1:03:52.165 --> 1:03:53.166
Sea monsters?

1:03:53.250 --> 1:03:56.253
I doubt your school would even
accept sea monsters, right?

1:03:57.462 --> 1:03:59.214
Ah, that's a weird joke, Alberto.

1:03:59.298 --> 1:04:01.133
Yeah, I know, it's kinda hard to imagine.

1:04:01.216 --> 1:04:02.384
So, let me just show you!

1:04:02.467 --> 1:04:03.635
-No!
-

1:04:04.803 --> 1:04:06.430
Come on.
-Giulia, wait!

1:04:06.513 --> 1:04:08.265
We don't have time to goof around.

1:04:15.564 --> 1:04:16.565
Help!

1:04:17.024 --> 1:04:18.192
Don't hurt us!

1:04:18.275 --> 1:04:19.902
-See? I knew this would...
-Sea monster!

1:04:21.195 --> 1:04:22.821
Did you hear that? This way.

1:04:22.905 --> 1:04:24.656
-Luca?

1:04:27.075 --> 1:04:28.243
Stay back!

1:04:29.203 --> 1:04:31.580
Sea monster! There it is!

1:04:35.876 --> 1:04:37.503
Ragazzi, now!

1:04:37.586 --> 1:04:38.587
No!

1:04:43.967 --> 1:04:46.136
Ah, idioti, you let it get away!

1:04:46.220 --> 1:04:47.221
To the boat!

1:04:47.304 --> 1:04:48.847
We're gonna kill a sea monster!

1:05:00.484 --> 1:05:01.860
-

1:05:03.028 --> 1:05:06.198
Oh, there you are. I made your favorite,

1:05:06.281 --> 1:05:07.741
trenette al pesto.

1:05:08.450 --> 1:05:09.785
Where's Alberto?

1:05:10.035 --> 1:05:12.829
Uh, he left, Signor Marcovaldo.

1:05:17.209 --> 1:05:18.752
Do you know where he went?

1:05:18.836 --> 1:05:20.796
No. But I don't think

1:05:20.879 --> 1:05:22.339
he wants anyone looking for him.

1:05:22.714 --> 1:05:25.050
Maybe not. But just in case.

1:05:28.846 --> 1:05:29.888
Okay.

1:05:29.972 --> 1:05:31.181
Well, the two of us can still do the race.

1:05:31.807 --> 1:05:34.226
You'll swim, you'll eat,
you've done both before...

1:05:34.309 --> 1:05:35.727
-Luca, I...
-...and I'll do the ride.

1:05:35.811 --> 1:05:37.229
I mean, that's allowed, right?

1:05:37.312 --> 1:05:38.897
-Luca. Luca?
-It should be fine,

1:05:38.981 --> 1:05:40.274
-we're still okay...
-Luca!

1:05:44.027 --> 1:05:46.488
Sleeping under the fish.
Now I get it.

1:05:46.572 --> 1:05:47.614
Uh, I can explain.

1:05:47.698 --> 1:05:50.409
Of all the places
for sea monsters to visit,

1:05:50.492 --> 1:05:51.785
Portorosso?

1:05:51.869 --> 1:05:53.495
Have you seen this town?

1:05:53.579 --> 1:05:55.998
My father hunts sea monsters!

1:05:56.373 --> 1:05:58.166
Luca, you have to get out of here.

1:05:58.250 --> 1:06:00.460
But I thought we were underdogs.

1:06:00.752 --> 1:06:03.297
Do you think I want you to leave?

1:06:03.380 --> 1:06:06.008
This is the happiest I've...

1:06:06.091 --> 1:06:07.968
Look, it's just not worth it.

1:06:08.051 --> 1:06:09.761
You don't understand.

1:06:09.845 --> 1:06:11.555
No, I don't.

1:06:11.638 --> 1:06:14.266
Risking your life for a Vespa?

1:06:14.600 --> 1:06:16.476
My parents were gonna send me away.

1:06:17.895 --> 1:06:20.314
That's why we did all of this.

1:06:23.192 --> 1:06:25.194
But it's over now.

1:06:29.364 --> 1:06:30.949
Goodbye, Giulia.

1:06:31.450 --> 1:06:32.784
I'm sorry.

1:07:14.868 --> 1:07:16.161
Alberto?

1:07:24.837 --> 1:07:26.463
What are you doing here?

1:07:27.172 --> 1:07:28.215
I'm...

1:07:29.174 --> 1:07:30.175
I'm sorry.

1:07:31.510 --> 1:07:33.887
I... I never should've done that.

1:07:33.971 --> 1:07:35.097
I wish I could take it back.

1:07:35.180 --> 1:07:38.267
Yeah, whatever. You're sorry.
Now, just go away!

1:07:56.952 --> 1:07:57.953
LUCA: Alberto?

1:07:58.579 --> 1:08:00.622
What are those marks on the wall?

1:08:02.291 --> 1:08:04.001
Tell me what they mean.

1:08:07.129 --> 1:08:08.922
I started when my dad left.

1:08:10.382 --> 1:08:14.219
You were living here alone
for that many days?

1:08:16.096 --> 1:08:18.390
I just stopped counting after a while.

1:08:19.224 --> 1:08:21.268
He said I was old enough to be on my own.

1:08:24.104 --> 1:08:25.731
I just thought that...

1:08:27.316 --> 1:08:28.734
...maybe he'd change his mind.

1:08:30.527 --> 1:08:32.029
Honestly, though, I get it.

1:08:32.404 --> 1:08:33.864
He's better off without me.

1:08:34.698 --> 1:08:35.699
You are, too.

1:08:35.782 --> 1:08:36.909
That's not true.

1:08:36.992 --> 1:08:38.076
ALBERTO: Yes, it is.

1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:40.412
You're not like me. You're the good kid.

1:08:40.913 --> 1:08:43.373
And I'm just
the kid that ruins everything.

1:08:43.749 --> 1:08:47.503
Silenzio, Bruno. That's just
the dumb voice in your head.

1:08:47.586 --> 1:08:48.754
You taught me that.

1:08:48.837 --> 1:08:51.006
And getting a Vespa? Seeing the world...

1:08:51.089 --> 1:08:52.674
Just let it go! Okay?

1:08:52.758 --> 1:08:54.551
Look, you and I
should've never been friends

1:08:54.635 --> 1:08:55.636
in the first place.

1:08:56.428 --> 1:08:57.763
LUCA: Don't say that.

1:08:57.846 --> 1:08:59.431
-Alberto?
-Get outta here!

1:08:59.515 --> 1:09:01.433
I'm not gonna tell you again.

1:09:06.772 --> 1:09:08.607
Okay. I'll go.

1:09:09.358 --> 1:09:10.526
I'll go win the race.

1:09:11.193 --> 1:09:12.611
-What?
-LUCA: Yeah.

1:09:13.070 --> 1:09:16.031
Yeah! And then the Vespa will be ours!

1:09:16.114 --> 1:09:17.908
And we'll ride away together!

1:09:17.991 --> 1:09:19.785
Luca, that's crazy.

1:09:19.868 --> 1:09:21.036
Well, maybe I'm crazy.

1:09:21.119 --> 1:09:22.746
Take me, gravity!

1:09:22.829 --> 1:09:23.914
ALBERTO: Luca!

1:09:23.997 --> 1:09:25.999
Ow.

1:09:26.333 --> 1:09:27.626
What are you doing?

1:09:27.709 --> 1:09:30.128
I'm okay. I'll be back tomorrow.

1:09:30.212 --> 1:09:32.130
I'm gonna fix this!

1:09:33.924 --> 1:09:36.343
-

1:09:37.719 --> 1:09:39.763
You want to split up your team?

1:09:39.847 --> 1:09:41.431
Yes. If it's allowed.

1:09:41.515 --> 1:09:43.308
Luca? What are you doing here?

1:09:43.392 --> 1:09:45.185
Don't worry. I'll race on my own.

1:09:45.269 --> 1:09:47.646
You can if you want,
but I don't recommend it.

1:09:47.729 --> 1:09:48.814
LUCA: Thank you!

1:09:48.897 --> 1:09:50.274
But how are you gonna...

1:09:50.357 --> 1:09:52.693
I mean, what happens when the...

1:09:52.776 --> 1:09:54.403
You can't swim!

1:09:54.486 --> 1:09:55.904
Alone again?

1:09:58.615 --> 1:09:59.616
DANIELA: Hmm.

1:09:59.700 --> 1:10:00.701
-Ah, volunteers...
-Huh?

1:10:00.784 --> 1:10:01.785
-...you're late.
-Huh?

1:10:01.869 --> 1:10:02.870
One cup for each kid.

1:10:02.953 --> 1:10:03.954
Oh!

1:10:04.037 --> 1:10:05.289
-Yeah. One cup per kid.
-LORENZO: Yes.

1:10:05.372 --> 1:10:06.373
-Got it.
-Here.

1:10:20.179 --> 1:10:22.890
Ciccio, hold still. Olio d'oliva.

1:10:22.973 --> 1:10:25.017
He will cut through the water
like a knife.

1:10:25.100 --> 1:10:27.186
-Oh! Ah.
-An oily knife.

1:10:27.895 --> 1:10:28.896
Huh?

1:10:28.979 --> 1:10:30.522
KIDS: Huh?

1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:38.238
This makes me laugh.

1:10:39.489 --> 1:10:41.575
I guess even your terrible friends

1:10:41.658 --> 1:10:42.743
don't want to be friends.

1:10:42.826 --> 1:10:45.662
Luca! This is a very bad idea!

1:10:45.746 --> 1:10:47.247
Hey, vagrant!

1:10:47.331 --> 1:10:49.666
Can't afford a proper swimsuit?

1:10:49.750 --> 1:10:51.126
Signore e signori,

1:10:51.210 --> 1:10:54.171
the Portorosso Cup is about to begin!

1:10:54.254 --> 1:10:56.715
We know there's been
a few sightings lately,

1:10:56.798 --> 1:10:58.133
but fear not!

1:10:58.217 --> 1:11:00.177
If any sea monsters show up today,

1:11:00.260 --> 1:11:01.762
we are ready for them.

1:11:04.348 --> 1:11:06.683
MARSIGLIESE: Swimmers, take your mark!

1:11:12.564 --> 1:11:14.566
-

1:11:46.056 --> 1:11:47.724
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1:11:50.060 --> 1:11:51.061
What?

1:11:58.735 --> 1:12:00.237
Swim, Ciccio! Come on!

1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:02.114
-Swim!
-

1:12:06.743 --> 1:12:08.370
Ha-ha! Trenette!

1:12:19.590 --> 1:12:21.258
-

1:12:27.389 --> 1:12:28.640
Come on!

1:12:31.602 --> 1:12:33.645
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me.

1:12:34.813 --> 1:12:37.441
Stop crying and tag Guido! Imbecille!

1:12:37.524 --> 1:12:39.234
Andiamo! Run, run!

1:12:43.405 --> 1:12:44.406
Finito!

1:12:49.953 --> 1:12:52.456
Per mille cavoli, Guido! Faster!

1:12:52.623 --> 1:12:54.416
-Eat, idiota! Più veloce!
-

1:12:54.499 --> 1:12:55.792
Hey, that's not allowed.

1:12:55.876 --> 1:12:57.044
He's done!

1:13:01.507 --> 1:13:02.716
Done!

1:13:10.265 --> 1:13:11.266
Whoa.

1:13:19.983 --> 1:13:21.693
But he's gotta be here somewhere.

1:13:21.777 --> 1:13:23.362
Thirsty? Water, anyone?

1:13:23.445 --> 1:13:24.613
-Please, don't!
-KID: Not again!

1:13:24.696 --> 1:13:26.448
That's him. That's him!

1:13:26.532 --> 1:13:27.533
-Luca, stop!
-

1:13:29.159 --> 1:13:31.745
Sorry, Mom! Sorry, Dad! I have to do this!

1:13:31.828 --> 1:13:34.831
Get back here right now!

1:13:35.290 --> 1:13:37.292
Wow. He's fast.

1:13:38.794 --> 1:13:40.420
-GIRL: What?

1:13:47.177 --> 1:13:48.637
-Oops! Scusa.
-

1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:50.806
downhill!

1:13:50.889 --> 1:13:53.642
Spewlia, you never even
made it to the downhill.

1:13:58.856 --> 1:14:02.901
Impossibile! He's cheating!
Arbitro! Arbitro!

1:14:03.902 --> 1:14:05.195
-Huh?

1:14:05.279 --> 1:14:06.321
No, no, no!

1:14:11.743 --> 1:14:12.744
LORENZO: Ooh.

1:14:21.211 --> 1:14:23.380
Oh, not now! Come on, come on!

1:14:23.463 --> 1:14:25.215
I'm so close!

1:14:27.301 --> 1:14:28.886
Luca!

1:14:31.513 --> 1:14:32.681
Just stay right there!

1:14:32.764 --> 1:14:33.765
Alberto.

1:14:33.849 --> 1:14:35.184
I'm coming for you!

1:14:35.809 --> 1:14:37.352
What's wrong, piccoletto?

1:14:37.436 --> 1:14:39.104
Afraid of a little rain?

1:14:39.188 --> 1:14:40.189
ALBERTO: Hey!
ERCOLE: Huh?

1:14:40.939 --> 1:14:43.192
For the last time,
you two don't belong here.

1:14:43.358 --> 1:14:45.068
Get out of my town!

1:14:48.906 --> 1:14:50.782
-

1:14:50.866 --> 1:14:53.243
Sea monster! Right there!

1:14:53.327 --> 1:14:54.369
Huh?

1:14:54.453 --> 1:14:55.537
Mamma mia!

1:14:55.621 --> 1:14:57.789
Ciccio! My harpoon! Veloce!

1:15:00.959 --> 1:15:03.962
-LUCA: Alberto...
-No, stop! Just stay there.

1:15:05.297 --> 1:15:06.423
You're still okay.

1:15:07.049 --> 1:15:09.343
-Andiamo!
-Alberto, wait!

1:15:12.930 --> 1:15:14.056
No!

1:15:32.199 --> 1:15:33.367
What?

1:15:33.700 --> 1:15:35.953
Whoa! You really are crazy!

1:15:36.036 --> 1:15:37.788
Learned it from you!

1:15:37.871 --> 1:15:39.373
Let's get to the water!

1:15:40.624 --> 1:15:42.042
No! Ciccio!

1:15:42.125 --> 1:15:43.126
Here it is.

1:15:47.798 --> 1:15:49.424
-Hey there.

1:15:49.508 --> 1:15:50.676
-Excuse us.

1:15:50.759 --> 1:15:53.220
-Out of the way! Via, via!
-

1:16:03.188 --> 1:16:04.189
ERCOLE: Ha-ha!

1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:06.900
-

1:16:07.359 --> 1:16:08.360
Luca!

1:16:11.655 --> 1:16:12.656
-

1:16:12.739 --> 1:16:14.741
-LUCA: Sorry!
-

1:16:22.374 --> 1:16:23.917
-Oh, no! Luca!
-LORENZO: Son!

1:16:26.461 --> 1:16:28.630
You should've left when I told you.

1:16:28.714 --> 1:16:31.758
Now, I gotta kill some sea monsters!

1:16:33.468 --> 1:16:36.138
So long, evil empire of injustice.

1:16:36.597 --> 1:16:38.015
-

1:16:40.851 --> 1:16:42.644
-No!
-

1:16:42.728 --> 1:16:43.979
-Giulia!

1:16:49.860 --> 1:16:52.154
Mostri marini! Give me that!

1:16:53.530 --> 1:16:54.948
Giulia. Are you all right?

1:16:55.032 --> 1:16:57.701
Yeah. Yeah. I'm... I'm okay.

1:17:00.579 --> 1:17:01.872
Giulietta?

1:17:01.955 --> 1:17:03.123
Papà! I...

1:17:06.293 --> 1:17:08.212
-MAN: Look at that!

1:17:08.295 --> 1:17:09.588
You're not going anywhere. Come on.

1:17:09.671 --> 1:17:12.508
I saw them first! The reward is mine!

1:17:13.050 --> 1:17:14.134
We're not afraid of you!

1:17:14.218 --> 1:17:16.345
No, but we're afraid of you.

1:17:16.428 --> 1:17:19.515
Everyone is horrified
and disgusted by you,

1:17:19.598 --> 1:17:21.475
because you are monsters.

1:17:21.558 --> 1:17:23.185
Stop! They are not monsters.

1:17:23.268 --> 1:17:25.187
Oh, yeah? Who are they, then?

1:17:25.270 --> 1:17:26.980
MASSIMO: I know who they are.

1:17:36.740 --> 1:17:39.451
They are Luca and Alberto,

1:17:40.953 --> 1:17:42.037
and...

1:17:42.913 --> 1:17:45.666
they are the winners.

1:17:47.501 --> 1:17:49.461
-Luca!
-Let us through!

1:17:49.545 --> 1:17:50.546
-What?
-Really?

1:17:50.629 --> 1:17:52.840
They can't be the winners.
They are not even people!

1:17:52.923 --> 1:17:54.258
Signora Marsigliese?

1:17:55.926 --> 1:17:58.512
Technically, legally,

1:17:59.012 --> 1:18:00.055
yes, they won.

1:18:00.138 --> 1:18:01.682
-We won?

1:18:01.765 --> 1:18:03.892
Who cares if they won?
They are sea monsters.

1:18:03.976 --> 1:18:05.853
-

1:18:09.439 --> 1:18:11.567
Andiamo.
-WOMAN: Hmm.

1:18:14.778 --> 1:18:15.779
What? Come on!

1:18:15.863 --> 1:18:16.864
-Hey!
-GIULIA: Ha!

1:18:16.947 --> 1:18:18.657
Ciccio! Guido! Another harpoon.

1:18:19.449 --> 1:18:23.203
Ah, idioti! Be useful for once
in your pathetic lives.

1:18:23.829 --> 1:18:25.455
-Guido.
-Ciccio.

1:18:27.124 --> 1:18:29.126
-

1:18:29.751 --> 1:18:31.628
-Oops.
-

1:18:31.712 --> 1:18:33.964
No, piccolino.

1:18:34.339 --> 1:18:36.300
It's over, the reign of terror.

1:18:36.383 --> 1:18:37.843
It's finally over!

1:18:37.926 --> 1:18:39.344
DANIELA: Luca!
LORENZO: Luca!

1:18:40.846 --> 1:18:42.973
You had us worried half to death,
and you must never do that again!

1:18:43.056 --> 1:18:44.057
LUCA: I'm sorry.

1:18:44.141 --> 1:18:47.060
And you raced your little tail off
and kicked so much human butt!

1:18:47.144 --> 1:18:50.189
And I'm so proud of you,
and I am so mad at you!

1:18:51.440 --> 1:18:52.816
I love you, Mom.

1:18:52.983 --> 1:18:53.984
Son.

1:18:58.363 --> 1:19:00.115
Signore e signori,

1:19:00.199 --> 1:19:03.577
the winners of this year's Portorosso Cup,

1:19:04.036 --> 1:19:05.329
the underdogs.

1:19:05.412 --> 1:19:07.581
-Wow.
-

1:19:07.706 --> 1:19:09.416
-Wow.
-Yeah!

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:11.335
LUCA: I can't believe we won!
ALBERTO: We won!

1:19:11.418 --> 1:19:12.794
GIULIA: Yes! Underdogs!

1:19:12.878 --> 1:19:14.546
-MAN: Ugh.

1:19:20.594 --> 1:19:22.137
-Give me that!
-Here.

1:19:25.390 --> 1:19:27.392
-

1:19:28.936 --> 1:19:29.978
GIULIA: We did it!

1:19:31.146 --> 1:19:32.272
BOY: They won!

1:19:35.776 --> 1:19:38.070
Feast your eyes on the greatest Vespa

1:19:38.153 --> 1:19:39.780
the world has ever seen!

1:19:42.241 --> 1:19:43.784
-Perfect.

1:19:48.997 --> 1:19:50.040
DANIELA: Mmm.

1:19:50.666 --> 1:19:52.543
-MASSIMO: Signora.
-Grazie.

1:19:52.626 --> 1:19:54.127
Mom! What are you doing here?

1:19:54.211 --> 1:19:56.213
I come to town most weekends.

1:19:57.422 --> 1:19:58.715
You're not gonna catch me!

1:19:58.799 --> 1:20:00.509
-Underdogs forever!
-ALBERTO: Whoo-hoo!

1:20:00.592 --> 1:20:05.430
What he did today was amazing.

1:20:05.514 --> 1:20:08.016
But we can't let him stay in this world.

1:20:08.684 --> 1:20:09.685
Can we?

1:20:09.768 --> 1:20:12.437
Some people, they'll never accept him.

1:20:13.605 --> 1:20:15.315
-But some will.
-

1:20:15.399 --> 1:20:18.610
And he seems to know
how to find the good ones.

1:20:22.072 --> 1:20:23.657
So, where will you go first?

1:20:23.740 --> 1:20:25.576
We're gonna stick around here for a bit.

1:20:25.659 --> 1:20:28.620
We gotta fix this thing up
before we take it across the entire Earth.

1:20:28.704 --> 1:20:31.206
Okay. Just don't forget to pack.

1:20:31.290 --> 1:20:34.710
Santo Gorgonzola!
I need to pack! For school!

1:20:34.793 --> 1:20:38.839
Oh, yeah, school.
You're gonna learn so much.

1:20:38.922 --> 1:20:41.258
Um, I can leave you some books.

1:20:41.341 --> 1:20:42.551
You can?

1:20:42.843 --> 1:20:44.469
Come on, Alberto!

1:20:56.523 --> 1:20:58.358
And you have your lunch for the train?

1:20:58.442 --> 1:21:00.736
-Sì.
-Sweater? If it gets cold?

1:21:00.819 --> 1:21:03.238
For the millionth time, sì.

1:21:03.322 --> 1:21:05.365
I love you, too, Papà.

1:21:07.409 --> 1:21:09.995
Santa mozzarella, we did it.

1:21:10.078 --> 1:21:12.414
Well, Giulia,
can't wait to race next summer.

1:21:12.497 --> 1:21:14.583
Or we could just have fun.

1:21:16.418 --> 1:21:17.711
Ciao, Giulia.

1:21:28.180 --> 1:21:30.807
Well, let's go fix up our Vespa.

1:21:30.891 --> 1:21:32.726
Yeah, about that. Uh...

1:21:32.809 --> 1:21:35.312
It's a crazy thing. I might have sold it.

1:21:38.815 --> 1:21:39.816
DANIELA: Luca?

1:21:40.067 --> 1:21:42.653
Mom? What are you all doing here?

1:21:44.112 --> 1:21:48.200
If you promise to write to us
every single day

1:21:48.283 --> 1:21:51.495
and be as safe as possible,
and I mean safer than safe,

1:21:52.246 --> 1:21:55.123
you can go to school.

1:21:55.582 --> 1:21:56.834
I can?

1:21:56.917 --> 1:21:58.502
It's all arranged, actually.

1:21:58.585 --> 1:22:00.587
You'd stay with Giulia and her mom.

1:22:00.671 --> 1:22:02.548
Your friend talked them into it.

1:22:02.631 --> 1:22:03.924
It wasn't easy.

1:22:06.218 --> 1:22:07.761
Luca, do you promise?

1:22:07.845 --> 1:22:09.555
Yes! Yes, I promise!

1:22:10.305 --> 1:22:11.515
Thank you.

1:22:13.100 --> 1:22:16.687
Oh. Just remember,
we are always here for you.

1:22:16.770 --> 1:22:17.771
Okay?

1:22:18.605 --> 1:22:20.732
Hey. Look me in the eye.

1:22:21.608 --> 1:22:23.485
You know I love you, right?

1:22:23.569 --> 1:22:25.571
I know.

1:22:31.076 --> 1:22:33.120
Come on, Alberto. The train's gonna leave.

1:22:35.330 --> 1:22:36.832
Where's your stuff?

1:22:37.624 --> 1:22:39.710
Yeah, well, you see...

1:22:39.793 --> 1:22:41.295
You are coming, right?

1:22:41.712 --> 1:22:46.008
Um, I would, but Massimo asked
if I wanted to stick around.

1:22:46.091 --> 1:22:48.927
Move in maybe. And I just thought, uh...

1:22:50.179 --> 1:22:52.806
I think he needs me.
You know?

1:22:54.850 --> 1:22:56.852
I can't do it without you.

1:22:56.935 --> 1:22:58.437
ALBERTO: But you're never without me.

1:23:01.064 --> 1:23:02.983
The next time that you jump off a cliff

1:23:03.066 --> 1:23:05.736
or tell Bruno to quit bothering you,

1:23:06.111 --> 1:23:07.362
that's me.

1:23:08.155 --> 1:23:11.366
But how am I gonna know you're okay?

1:23:19.291 --> 1:23:21.126
You got me off the island, Luca.

1:23:23.462 --> 1:23:24.505
I'm okay.

1:23:27.257 --> 1:23:29.218
-

1:23:33.555 --> 1:23:36.808
Seriously,
what does that mean?

1:23:36.975 --> 1:23:39.520
No idea. Go find out for me, will ya?

1:23:49.696 --> 1:23:51.657
Go, Luca!

1:23:51.740 --> 1:23:53.325
Go!

1:23:53.408 --> 1:23:56.370
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1:33:47.419 --> 1:33:50.297
Some people think
I'm mad to live in the deep.

1:33:50.714 --> 1:33:53.425
I think that they are the ones
who are mad,

1:33:53.509 --> 1:33:56.136
not me the one who is mad, it's them.

1:33:56.303 --> 1:33:58.388
It's a nice life, simple life.

1:33:58.555 --> 1:34:00.474
It's away from the hustle and bustle,

1:34:00.557 --> 1:34:02.184
all the stuff that you don't want.

1:34:04.811 --> 1:34:07.064
Mmm. Whale carcass.

1:34:07.814 --> 1:34:09.274
Anyway, you're gonna have fun.

1:34:09.566 --> 1:34:12.986
You'll get to hear me talk.
I can talk without stopping,

1:34:13.070 --> 1:34:16.240
sometimes for maybe 12 hours.

1:34:16.615 --> 1:34:19.034
And you get to listen, so you're lucky.

1:34:20.577 --> 1:34:22.079
Well done.
