YOU'RE JUST A LOSER AS IT IS,

08:21.667 --> 08:24.670

08:49.695 --> 08:53.658
{\an8}YOU [bleep] UP.
YOU'RE A [bleep] LOSER.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.034
{\an8}YOU'VE RUINED THE BEST THING

08:55.117 --> 08:56.827
{\an8}THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO YOU,
YOU [bleep].

08:56.911 --> 08:58.788
{\an8}YOU MADE ME CRY.
I'M NOT CRYING ANYMORE.

08:58.871 --> 08:59.997
{\an8}I'M READY TO [bleep]
CHOP YOUR BALLS OFF.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.708
{\an8}- LET'S GO TO BED
BEFORE YOU START CHOPPING OFF--

09:04.377 --> 09:06.128
{\an8}[laughter]

09:09.048 --> 09:11.509
{\an8}- ARE WE READY?

{\an8}- SITUATION.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.887
{\an8}[horn honks]

09:21.060 --> 09:22.979
{\an8}- YO, PAULY.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.064
{\an8}SOMEBODY BROKE A PLATE
WHILE WE WERE GONE?

09:25.147 --> 09:26.899
{\an8}- WE GET HOME FROM THE CLUB,
AND THE HOUSE IS A MESS.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.484
{\an8}THERE'S, LIKE,
BROKEN DISHES OUTSIDE.

09:28.567 --> 09:29.944
{\an8}AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT WENT ON.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.112
{\an8}- OH, DAMN.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:31.195 --> 09:33.489
{\an8}I THINK I MIGHT BE SLEEPING
OUTSIDE TONIGHT.

09:33.572 --> 09:36.200
{\an8}- SNOOK.
- OH, THIS IS SNOOKI.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.243
{\an8}OUR MAIN ATTRACTION.
- SNOOKI!

09:37.326 --> 09:38.327
{\an8}- WHAT'S UP, BABY DOLL?

09:38.411 --> 09:40.121
{\an8}- I HAD THE WORST DAY
OF MY LIFE, BOYS.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.497
{\an8}HE'S, LIKE, "OH, WELL,

09:41.580 --> 09:42.665
{\an8}THERE'S NAKED GIRLS
AT THE CLUB ANYWAY, [bleep] YOU.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.666
{\an8}- YOU DON'T NEED THAT.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

09:43.749 --> 09:48.045
{\an8}LIKE, [bleep] HIM.

09:50.047 --> 09:53.092
{\an8}- DOESN'T EVEN [bleep]
COME IN HERE AND SAY HELLO,

09:53.175 --> 09:55.678
{\an8}AFTER YOU'RE [bleep]
AT 6:00 IN THE MORNING?

09:55.761 --> 10:00.349
{\an8}AND I'M WAITING HERE FOR YOU
'CAUSE I LOVE YOU?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.310
{\an8}AND YOU'RE [bleep]
OUT AT THE CLUB?

10:02.393 --> 10:05.438
{\an8}[laughs bitterly]

10:08.733 --> 10:11.527
{\an8}HOW WAS THE CLUB?
GOOD?

10:11.610 --> 10:15.531
{\an8}I'M GLAD IT WAS WORTH IT
TO YOU.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.868
{\an8}- DON'T POINT AT ME LIKE THAT.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.995
{\an8}- I DIDN'T GO OUT WITH
THE GIRLS SPECIFICALLY

10:21.078 --> 10:24.040
{\an8}'CAUSE I'M WAITING--
I'M WAITING FOR YOU,

10:24.123 --> 10:25.207
{\an8}LIKE A BITCH.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.542
{\an8}- YOU ARE A BITCH.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.586
{\an8}I'M GETTING TO A POINT NOW

10:28.669 --> 10:30.004
{\an8}WHERE IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW,
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

10:30.087 --> 10:32.882
{\an8}I DON'T THINK I'VE STARTED
ANY ARGUMENTS YET.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.050
{\an8}STARTING TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE JUST

10:34.133 --> 10:35.384
{\an8}BEATING A DEAD HORSE
AT THIS POINT.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.720
{\an8}AND IF THE HORSE IS DEAD,

10:37.803 --> 10:40.056
{\an8}THEN YOU GOT TO
LEAVE IT ALONE.

10:40.139 --> 10:40.681
{\an8}WHY DID YOU GO TO THE CLUB?

10:40.765 --> 10:43.434
{\an8}- YOU LEGIT LAID IN BED,

10:43.517 --> 10:45.561
{\an8}AND EVERYONE HEARD YOU SAY,
"IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT

10:45.644 --> 10:46.562
{\an8}WITH YOUR FRIENDS,
GO OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS."

10:46.645 --> 10:49.065
{\an8}- IT WAS LIKE A TEST,
AND YOU FAILED.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.608
{\an8}- I'M NOT IN [bleep] SCHOOL.

10:50.691 --> 10:51.400
{\an8}I'M NOT IN SCHOOL, OKAY?

10:51.484 --> 10:52.735
{\an8}- I DON'T LIKE TESTS.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.237
{\an8}THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T GO
TO COLLEGE.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.239
{\an8}[laughs]
DON'T TEST ME.

10:57.323 --> 11:01.535
{\an8}'CAUSE I WILL FAIL
THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME.

11:01.619 --> 11:02.912
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY ARE YOU WITH ME?

11:02.995 --> 11:04.747
{\an8}I'M ASKING YOU.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.415
{\an8}- I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER
FOR THAT.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.001
{\an8}- IT'S 6:00 IN THE MORNING,
SO [bleep] YOU.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.586
{\an8}[bleep] YOU.

11:10.669 --> 11:14.423
{\an8}- I [bleep] MYSELF EVERY DAY
WHEN I'M WITH YOU.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.133
{\an8}- I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE
AND CRY OVER SOMEBODY

11:16.217 --> 11:19.261
{\an8}WHO, WELL, OBVIOUSLY
[bleep] DOESN'T CARE.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.554
{\an8}- I DEFINITELY
DON'T LIKE TO SEE SAMMI CRY,

11:20.638 --> 11:21.597
{\an8}BUT I'M NOT GONNA HOLD BACK
ABOUT THE WAY I FEEL

11:21.680 --> 11:23.724
{\an8}AND WHAT'S GONNA COME OUT OF
MY MOUTH

11:23.808 --> 11:25.017
{\an8}TO MAKE HER FEEL BETTER
ABOUT HERSELF.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.186
{\an8}IF THAT'S THE WAY
I'M FEELING AT THE MOMENT,

11:27.269 --> 11:28.229
{\an8}THEN I'M GONNA SAY
WHAT'S ON MY MIND.

11:28.312 --> 11:31.399
{\an8}- YOU'VE [bleep]
PUT ME THROUGH ENOUGH.

11:31.482 --> 11:32.858
{\an8}I'M [bleep] DONE.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.652
{\an8}SO DON'T TALK TO ME TOMORROW.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.279
{\an8}DON'T TALK TO ME FOR
THE REST OF THE TIME I'M HERE.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.489
{\an8}'CAUSE I'M OVER YOU.

11:38.572 --> 11:39.949
{\an8}GET THAT.
I'M [bleep] OVER YOU.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.242
{\an8}'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA
SIT IN MY BED

11:41.325 --> 11:42.451
{\an8}WAITING FOR
MY [bleep] BOYFRIEND

11:42.535 --> 11:44.036
{\an8}WHO'S AT A [bleep] CLUB!

11:44.120 --> 11:44.912
{\an8}I'M NOT DOING THAT.

11:44.995 --> 11:47.039
{\an8}AND I DIDN'T DO [bleep]
TO YOU.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.791
{\an8}I NEVER CHEATED ON YOU.
I DIDN'T DO [bleep] TO YOU.

11:48.874 --> 11:52.294
{\an8}SO [bleep] YOU.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.089
{\an8}- HAVE YOU EVER CHEATED ON
YOUR BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND?

11:55.172 --> 11:56.590
{\an8}- [gasps]
RONNIE.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.134
{\an8}- AND, LIKE, NOBODY SAID
ANYTHING.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.511
{\an8}SHE HAS AN IDEA.
SHE'S NOT THAT STUPID.

12:00.594 --> 12:02.680
{\an8}- I NEED TO SAY SOMETHING.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.349
{\an8}RON. RON.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.435
{\an8}[bleep].

12:17.611 --> 12:19.864
{\an8}- MOSHI MOSHI!

12:19.947 --> 12:21.866
{\an8}- OH, YAY, CHOPSTICKS.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.033
{\an8}[gasps]

12:23.117 --> 12:25.744
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD,
I FEEL LIKE I'M DYING.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.163
{\an8}- I'M FREEZING.
- ME TOO.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.374
{\an8}- I'M EXHAUSTED.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.959
{\an8}ALL THE FIGHTING WITH RON
IS AFFECTING ME,

12:32.042 --> 12:34.044
{\an8}LIKE, EMOTIONALLY
WEARING ME DOWN.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.463
{\an8}I JUST NEED TO GO OUT
WITH THE GIRLS

12:35.546 --> 12:36.839
{\an8}AND JUST ENJOY MYSELF
A LITTLE BIT

12:36.922 --> 12:39.633
{\an8}SO I'M NOT FOCUSING
ON RONNIE, LIKE, 24-7.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.178
{\an8}I GOT SO PISSED LAST NIGHT,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

12:42.261 --> 12:43.554
{\an8}PAULY HAS--
IS WITH A GIRL.

12:43.637 --> 12:44.680
{\an8}MIKE'S TALKING TO A GIRL.
LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

12:44.763 --> 12:47.099
{\an8}AND THEN VINNIE'S TALKING TO
A GIRL.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.351
{\an8}AND THEN I'M LIKE, JUST, LIKE,
"WHAT THE [bleep]?"

12:49.435 --> 12:50.519
{\an8}- THIS IS WHAT I DON'T GET.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.479
{\an8}IF ALL OF THEM
ARE TALKING TO GIRLS,

12:51.562 --> 12:53.731
{\an8}LIKE,
IS RON JUST SITTING THERE?

12:57.318 --> 12:58.861
{\an8}- I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW,
LIKE,

12:58.944 --> 13:02.031
{\an8}I DIDN'T SEE RONNIE
DO ANYTHING.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.659
{\an8}- YEAH?
- NOT LAST NIGHT.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.036
{\an8}EVERY OTHER NIGHT,
I DON'T REALLY PAY ATTENTION

13:07.119 --> 13:08.412
{\an8}TO WHAT HE DOES.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.497
{\an8}- THERE ARE
SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES

13:09.580 --> 13:11.832
{\an8}FOR ANGELINA JUST TO TELL SAM
THE TRUTH.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.959
{\an8}AND THEN WHEN I SAW ANGELINA,
LIKE A SCARED PUPPY,

13:14.043 --> 13:15.711
{\an8}LIKE, I WASN'T EVEN MAD.

13:15.794 --> 13:16.837
{\an8}I WAS JUST, LIKE,
"OH, MY GOD,

13:16.921 --> 13:19.965
{\an8}THIS GIRL'S SO STUPID."

13:28.891 --> 13:31.435
{\an8}I'M ALLERGIC TO PECANS
SOMETIMES.

13:31.519 --> 13:32.561
{\an8}- I KNOW
I WANT SOMETHING ELSE.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.395
{\an8}- YEAH,
I WANT SOMETHING ELSE.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.482
{\an8}- MOSHI MOSHI.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.651
{\an8}I FEEL [bleep] BLOATED NOW.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.069
{\an8}- I ATE TOO MUCH.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.529
{\an8}- [burps]

13:41.612 --> 13:42.821
{\an8}- TRYING TO DRIVE HERE.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.031
{\an8}- [gasps]

13:46.492 --> 13:50.913
{\an8}- I'M CRANKY.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.415
{\an8}- WE GOT CUPS, FORKS,
KNIVES.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.751
{\an8}TODAY'S SUNDAY.

13:55.834 --> 13:56.377
{\an8}I WANNA COOK
A LITTLE SUNDAY DINNER TODAY,

13:56.460 --> 13:58.671
{\an8}OUR FIRST FAMILY DINNER,

13:58.754 --> 14:00.381
{\an8}BECAUSE OUR LAST DINNER
WAS PRETTY MUCH

14:00.464 --> 14:01.840
{\an8}SABOTAGED BY SNOOKI

14:01.924 --> 14:05.135
{\an8}BY DROPPING THE CHICKEN
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.263
{\an8}CHICKEN, CHICKEN, CHICKEN.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.725
{\an8}- HELLO.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.144
{\an8}[crashing noises]

14:14.228 --> 14:15.437
{\an8}- [screams]

14:15.521 --> 14:17.106
{\an8}- SON.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.525
{\an8}YOU REALLY SCREWED
SURF AND TURF NIGHT.

14:19.608 --> 14:20.609
{\an8}- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

14:20.693 --> 14:22.820
{\an8}- THAT WAS MY SAUCE?
- YEAH.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.071
{\an8}- WE'RE HAVE TO USE
THE MARINARA.

14:24.154 --> 14:25.573
{\an8}- I KNOW, WE HAVE TO USE
THE MARINARA NOW.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.449
{\an8}THAT WAS SOME GOOD-ASS SAUCE.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.119
{\an8}- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO USE
THE MARINARA.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.580
{\an8}- IT'S [bleep] SITUATION
HOSTILE RIGHT NOW.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.124
{\an8}IT'S TIME TO [bleep]
NOW MAKE THE SAUCE

14:35.207 --> 14:37.501
{\an8}THAT WASN'T REALLY MEANT
FOR IT.

14:37.585 --> 14:40.963
{\an8}- REALLY?
- MIMOSA.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.340
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.
- OH, MY GOD.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.134
{\an8}OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.927
{\an8}- THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA
HIT ME IN THE FACE.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.763
{\an8}YOU WERE GONNA [bleep]
TAKE MY EYE OUT WITH THAT THING.

14:49.847 --> 14:53.559
{\an8}- OH, MAN.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.519
{\an8}- [bleep]
- WHAT THE--

14:55.603 --> 14:57.938
{\an8}WHAT DO YOU GOT,
BUTTER FINGERS?

14:58.022 --> 14:58.564
{\an8}- BRO, WHO DECIDED TO PUT
THE MILK

14:58.647 --> 15:00.649
{\an8}ON TOP OF [bleep]--

15:00.733 --> 15:02.985
{\an8}- FIRST OF ALL--
- MARONNA MIA!

15:03.068 --> 15:05.988
{\an8}- THE CAN'S GOT TO COME
OUT OF THE BOX, YOU GUYS.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.282
{\an8}- HOLY [bleep].
- TAKES UP LESS ROOM.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.868
{\an8}THAT SAUCE WOULD HAVE BEEN
GOOD AS HELL TOO.

15:10.951 --> 15:14.330
{\an8}- CHEERS, EVERYONE.
- LOVE YOU, BITCHES.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.789
{\an8}- SORRY.
CHEERS TO YOUR MEAL.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.791
{\an8}- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DRAMA
IN OUR HOUSE,

15:17.875 --> 15:19.460
{\an8}SO NOW THAT WE'RE FINALLY
EATING TOGETHER

15:19.543 --> 15:22.963
{\an8}AT THE TABLE AS A FAMILY
AND WE'VE MADE IT THIS FAR

15:23.047 --> 15:24.882
{\an8}WITHOUT KILLING EACH OTHER,

15:24.965 --> 15:26.800
{\an8}WE KNOW THAT WE CAN GET ALONG
FOR THE REST OF THE TIME HERE.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.636
{\an8}- YO, LAST NIGHT, KLUTCH

15:28.719 --> 15:29.887
{\an8}THERE WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.347
{\an8}- THE FUNNIEST PART WAS WHEN

15:31.430 --> 15:32.640
{\an8}RONNIE WAS DANCING WITH
THAT BLONDE GIRL

15:32.723 --> 15:33.641
{\an8}AND YOU WERE, LIKE--
YOU LOOKED AT ME LIKE,

15:33.724 --> 15:35.267
{\an8}"GET THE [bleep]
OUT OF HERE."

15:35.351 --> 15:38.520
{\an8}- ANGELINA, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S GOT DIARRHEA OF THE MOUTH.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.730
{\an8}AND I WAS LIKE,
"MIND YOUR BUSINESS,

15:39.813 --> 15:41.273
{\an8}"'CAUSE YOU KNOW
I GOTTA DEAL WITH SAM,

15:41.357 --> 15:42.566
{\an8}AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DEAL WITH ME."

15:42.650 --> 15:43.734
{\an8}- NOW LOOKIT.

15:43.817 --> 15:45.569
{\an8}WE'RE LIKE ONE BIG
DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.987
{\an8}- DYSFUNCTIONAL.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.864
{\an8}- DYSFUNCTIONAL'S GOOD.
[chuckles]

{\an8}- AND SHE KIND OF, LIKE,
PUT ME ON THE SPOT,

36:16.674 --> 36:19.802
{\an8}AND I FEEL LIKE JENNI AND SNOOKI
ARE CLOSER TO SAMMI THAN I AM,

36:19.886 --> 36:21.095
{\an8}AND I FEEL LIKE
JENNI AND SNOOKI

36:21.178 --> 36:22.972
{\an8}SHOULD HAVE STEPPED UP TO
THE PLATE AND TOLD HER TOO.

36:23.055 --> 36:23.848
{\an8}LIKE, WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE
ONE IN THE HOUSE TO SAY IT?

36:23.931 --> 36:24.891
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

36:24.974 --> 36:26.100
{\an8}LIKE, WHAT, AM I GONNA BE,

36:26.183 --> 36:28.436
{\an8}LIKE THE DRAMA STARTER
IN THIS HOUSE?

36:28.519 --> 36:30.354
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE
YOU KNOW SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.106
{\an8}- LISTEN, I'M NOT GETTING
INVOLVED IN YOUR [bleep].

36:32.190 --> 36:33.316
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

36:33.399 --> 36:36.819
{\an8}IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
IN THE FUTURE, WHATEVER.

36:36.903 --> 36:37.778
{\an8}- IF YOU KNOW ABOUT IT,

36:37.862 --> 36:40.281
{\an8}YOU SHOULD COME TO ME
AND TELL ME.

36:43.075 --> 36:44.869
{\an8}WOULD YOU?

36:44.952 --> 36:46.996
{\an8}- NOW THAT WE'RE FRIENDS,
YEAH.

36:47.079 --> 36:49.165
{\an8}NOW THAT WE'RE COOL, YES.

36:49.248 --> 36:50.416
{\an8}- GOOD.

36:50.499 --> 36:53.753
{\an8}I FEEL ANGELINA WAS VERY,
LIKE, HONEST AND REAL.

36:53.836 --> 36:55.129
{\an8}AND I WOULD DEFINITELY
FEEL BETRAYED

36:55.212 --> 36:58.049
{\an8}IF EVERYBODY KNEW SOMETHING
I DIDN'T KNOW.

37:03.137 --> 37:05.306
{\an8}MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

37:05.389 --> 37:06.390
{\an8}HIGH FIVE.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.683
{\an8}- IT'S ONLY HALFWAY
ACCOMPLISHED.

37:07.767 --> 37:08.643
{\an8}- OKAY.

37:08.726 --> 37:11.771
{\an8}- SLIP IT IN HER DRAWER,
AND WE WAIT.

{\an8}- VINNY. WHERE'S RON?
- I DON'T KNOW.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.795
{\an8}PROBABLY WENT SOMEWHERE
WITH MIKE.

38:17.878 --> 38:19.171
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE SLEEPING?

38:19.255 --> 38:20.756

{\an8}I DID SAY I WAS GONNA DO IT,
BUT DID I DO IT?

38:49.285 --> 38:50.870
{\an8}NO, I DIDN'T WRITE IT.

38:50.953 --> 38:52.038
{\an8}SO I FEEL LIKE THEY WANT ME
TO GET INVOLVED

38:52.121 --> 38:52.913
{\an8}IN, LIKE, THE BLAME.

JUST NOW?

38:56.000 --> 38:56.834
{\an8}- YOU JUST ASKED ME
FOUR TIMES.

38:56.917 --> 38:59.670
{\an8}I JUST TOLD YOU.
I DON'T KNOW.

39:22.526 --> 39:23.319
{\an8}- ANGELINA...

39:23.402 --> 39:26.530
{\an8}DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT RON.

{\an8}I DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.241

{\an8}WE'RE ALL INVOLVED,
YOU KNOW?

39:32.369 --> 39:33.579
{\an8}I DON'T TRUST ANGELINA.

39:33.662 --> 39:35.164
{\an8}JUST, LIKE,
SOMETHING IN MY BODY SAYING,

39:35.247 --> 39:36.540
{\an8}"DON'T TRUST THIS GIRL."

39:36.624 --> 39:38.417
{\an8}HONESTLY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF SHE'S GONNA

39:38.501 --> 39:39.543
{\an8}KEEP HER MOUTH SHUT.

39:39.627 --> 39:43.297
{\an8}I TOLD RON THAT
I WAS GONNA TELL SAM EVERYTHING.

39:43.380 --> 39:44.632
{\an8}AND HE WAS LIKE,
"IF YOU DO THAT--"

39:44.715 --> 39:45.633
{\an8}HE THREATENED ME--
HE GOES, "I WILL TELL EMILIO

39:45.716 --> 39:48.010
{\an8}THAT YOU CHEAT ON HIM
ALL THE TIME."

39:48.094 --> 39:49.345
{\an8}RON GETS NASTY.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.263
{\an8}- NOW I'M, LIKE, IN A BAD SPOT.
WE ALL ARE.

{\an8}NOT TO TELL
WHO WROTE THE LETTER,

40:00.314 --> 40:03.234
{\an8}BECAUSE I WOULD PROBABLY
DO PHYSICAL DAMAGE

40:03.317 --> 40:06.654
{\an8}TOWARDS ANGELINA
AND EXPLAIN TO EVERYONE

40:06.737 --> 40:07.571
