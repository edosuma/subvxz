<Font color=#FFFFO0>One Man's Treasure</font>

00:00.258 --> 00:01.237
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.264 --> 00:02.864
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.198 --> 00:04.924
psychopaths and mystery writers.

00:05.262 --> 00:06.284
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.585 --> 00:07.285
Who am I?

00:07.374 --> 00:08.513
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.514 --> 00:08.608
Castle.

00:08.948 --> 00:09.608
Castle.

00:09.609 --> 00:11.309
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.655 --> 00:13.945
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:14.055 --> 00:14.974
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.009 --> 00:15.929
Beckett.
Beckett.

00:15.964 --> 00:17.870
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:17.916 --> 00:19.502
And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,

00:19.503 --> 00:20.503
I get to be on her case.

00:20.737 --> 00:22.480
I would be happy
to let you spank me.

00:22.515 --> 00:23.791
And together, we catch killers

00:24.439 --> 00:25.627
We make a pretty
good team, you know?

00:25.728 --> 00:26.428
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:26.562 --> 00:27.256
Turner and Hooch.

00:27.257 --> 00:29.057
You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

Check your six, Maverick.

01:08.412 --> 01:10.714
This is your captain
up and on the mountain.

01:10.748 --> 01:12.381
Listen up,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:12.415 --> 01:14.250
Our fugitive has been on the run
for 90 minutes.

01:14.384 --> 01:17.219
We're in the pipes. Let's keep
our feet dry this time.

01:17.254 --> 01:19.988
Jungle radio,
this is One Delta Bravo.

01:20.022 --> 01:22.724
Eyes on suspect.
Requesting backup, over.

01:23.659 --> 01:25.394
Requesting permission to deploy

01:25.428 --> 01:28.664
laser-activated
radioactive immobilizer.

01:28.698 --> 01:30.199
Permission denied.

01:30.633 --> 01:31.900
Really. Richard.

01:31.935 --> 01:33.535
I have all of these
new lines to learn

01:33.569 --> 01:35.504
before my play goes into rehearsal.

01:35.505 --> 01:36.505
I'm goin' in.

01:36.738 --> 01:38.273
If that comes any closer,
you're gonna have

01:38.307 --> 01:41.477
Black Hawk down on your hands.
Oh!

01:43.446 --> 01:45.047
What's all this?

01:45.281 --> 01:46.518
Official police tactical training.

01:47.252 --> 01:48.788
Oh, hey, dad.
Did you get a chance to sign

01:48.823 --> 01:50.558
that permission slip
I gave you the other day?

01:50.959 --> 01:52.159
Haven't you learned to forge
my signature yet?

01:52.193 --> 01:54.526
Ah. Credit cards? Yes.
Permission slips? No.

01:54.661 --> 01:55.660
It's my civics class.

01:55.694 --> 01:58.128
Every student has a 3-day
volunteer internship at one of

01:58.162 --> 02:00.829
the city's agencies...
law enforcement, sanitation, fire.

02:00.963 --> 02:03.598
Oh, go with fire.
They have the best calendars.

02:03.599 --> 02:04.599
I went with law enforcement.

02:04.633 --> 02:05.968
Detective Beckett
already said it's cool

02:06.002 --> 02:07.303
if I volunteer down at the station.

02:07.304 --> 02:10.304
Oh, well, as a member of
the NYPD volunteer squad,

02:10.338 --> 02:12.172
I would be happy
to show you the ropes.

02:12.306 --> 02:13.940
Actually, Detective Beckett
is giving me

02:13.974 --> 02:15.642
my orientation course
tomorrow morning.

02:15.976 --> 02:19.077
Then I would be honored
to carpool with you

02:19.112 --> 02:19.980
or share a cab.

02:20.881 --> 02:21.681
hmm.

02:22.614 --> 02:23.682
Castle.

02:24.716 --> 02:26.384
Prelim suggests the victim died

02:26.418 --> 02:29.521
of a single gunshot wound
to the chest at close range.

02:29.755 --> 02:32.390
- Any signs of struggle?
- Contusions coming up here...

02:32.525 --> 02:34.025
- Uh-huh.
- And here.

02:34.060 --> 02:37.127
But it's likely a result of his
tumble down the trash chute.

02:40.830 --> 02:42.031
What?

02:42.066 --> 02:43.433
What are you doing?

02:43.667 --> 02:45.202
Well, I can't breathe
through my nose.

02:45.236 --> 02:47.272
I happen to have
a very acute sense of smell.

02:47.873 --> 02:49.673
Suck it up, Castle.
Real cops deal with worse.

02:49.706 --> 02:52.074
Yeah, not to mention
medical examiners.

02:52.109 --> 02:54.776
Do you know how long
I have to shower

02:54.810 --> 02:56.278
before heading out on a date?

02:56.345 --> 02:58.181
No, but if you need someone
to time it for you,

02:58.215 --> 02:59.784
- I'd be happy to...
- found it!

03:02.518 --> 03:04.620
It must have fallen out of
his jacket on the way down.

03:06.254 --> 03:07.488
Yep, that's our guy.

03:07.522 --> 03:09.224
All right the name
is Sam Parker.

03:09.358 --> 03:13.694
And the driver's license has his
address placed in Connecticut.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.161
Maybe he's visiting
someone in the building.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.562
You mean dropping by?

03:16.995 --> 03:18.763
Ryan here.

03:18.797 --> 03:20.264
Thanks, bro.

03:20.298 --> 03:21.698
Esposito's up on 15.

03:21.733 --> 03:23.334
Says he found out
where our guy was shot.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.504
All right. Let's go.

03:29.706 --> 03:32.575
From the blood spatter,
our guy was shot right here.

03:32.609 --> 03:35.210
Then...

03:35.244 --> 03:37.478
He was shoved head first
down the chute.

03:37.513 --> 03:38.880
A kill who cleans up
after himself.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.216
Very "American Psycho."

03:40.217 --> 03:42.417
He probably wanted to get out
of the building unnoticed.

03:42.550 --> 03:44.051
Figured that the dumpster
wouldn't be emptied

03:44.085 --> 03:45.319
for a couple of days.

03:45.353 --> 03:46.854
He didn't count on a tenant
on the seventh floor...

03:47.189 --> 03:50.256
a hottie...
seeing the body drop

03:50.290 --> 03:51.792
As she threw out her pizza box.

03:51.793 --> 03:53.793
Is she distraut?
Because I can be very comforting.

03:53.827 --> 03:55.261
- CSUs?
- Team's on its way.

03:55.695 --> 03:56.896
Neighbors didn't hear the shot.

03:57.231 --> 04:00.065
Ah. Poor-man's silencer.

04:00.099 --> 04:02.267
He must have picked it up
from this pile here

04:02.301 --> 04:03.703
and then thrown it back
when he was done.

04:03.704 --> 04:04.704
Resourceful.

04:04.737 --> 04:06.572
How did a clean-cut suburban guy
end up this far from home

04:06.607 --> 04:08.175
dead and thrown out with the trash?

04:15.512 --> 04:18.014
Are you ready?
Here we go.

04:23.953 --> 04:25.353
I know Alexis
already talked to you.

04:25.987 --> 04:27.289
I just wanted to make sure
that you're really okay

04:27.323 --> 04:28.458
with having her here.

04:28.459 --> 04:30.059
I wouldn't have said yes
if I wasn't.

04:30.392 --> 04:31.825
Well, yeah, but you're busy,

04:31.860 --> 04:33.462
and I just don't want her
to be in the way.

04:33.863 --> 04:35.663
Big Castle is the one
who likes to get in the way.

04:35.697 --> 04:37.365
I'm sure little Castle
will be a pleasure.

04:37.566 --> 04:39.366
Sam Parker, age 38.

04:39.399 --> 04:42.200
Lives in Connecticut
with his wife Helen and his two kids.

04:42.234 --> 04:43.702
Wife's en route to the morgue
to ID the body.

04:43.737 --> 04:44.937
We contacted the leasing office,

04:44.971 --> 04:46.639
and they don't have a Sam Parker
listed as a tenant.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.040
So he probably was
visiting someone.

04:48.074 --> 04:50.441
Uniforms are canvassing.
No hits yet.

04:50.476 --> 04:52.043
CSU's working
to untangle the prints,

04:52.077 --> 04:54.612
but since it's a common room,
there's probably dozens of them.

04:54.746 --> 04:57.714
However, the chute handle,
doorknob and soda bottle

04:57.748 --> 04:58.616
were all wiped clean.

04:58.817 --> 05:00.417
All right, let's go visit
the wife at the morgue.

05:00.450 --> 05:02.419
Maybe she can tell us what he
was doing in the city tonight.

05:02.420 --> 05:04.120
And if she doesn't know,
that tells us something, too.

05:04.154 --> 05:05.121
Mm-hmm.

05:05.655 --> 05:06.422
Uh, here you go.

05:06.457 --> 05:09.557
Oh, fresh.
And hot and hot and hot.

05:09.592 --> 05:10.960
He doesn't make me coffee.

05:13.995 --> 05:14.729
You okay?

05:14.863 --> 05:17.566
It's never easy, no matter
how much experience you have.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.235
Oh, my God.

05:23.637 --> 05:27.205
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.
I am with the NYPD.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.207
I'm very sorry for your loss.

05:29.241 --> 05:31.576
Do you have any idea
who did this?

05:31.610 --> 05:34.480
We are doing everything
we can to figure that out.

05:38.182 --> 05:40.883
Um, excuse me. We're in
the middle of an identification.

05:41.518 --> 05:43.518
That's why she's here.

05:43.553 --> 05:45.153
And you are?

05:45.187 --> 05:47.021
I'm here to identify my husband.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.155
Oh, my God.

05:51.425 --> 05:53.760
Excuse me, your husband?

05:54.794 --> 05:56.462
What's your relation
to the victim?

05:56.596 --> 05:57.931
I'm his fiancÃ©e.

05:58.265 --> 06:00.500
I'm sorry.
What did you just say?

06:01.234 --> 06:02.601
I'm his fiancÃ©e.

06:06.204 --> 06:10.741
Dude, you are so busted.

06:25.298 --> 06:27.666
I don't even know how to

06:27.700 --> 06:28.801
I'm just scared that...

06:29.435 --> 06:30.802
Is that our vic's wife?

06:32.537 --> 06:33.504
FiancÃ©e.

06:33.538 --> 06:35.606
The wife is over there.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.407
Come again?

06:38.742 --> 06:40.009
FiancÃ©e.

06:40.043 --> 06:41.877
- Mm-hmm.
- Wife.

06:41.911 --> 06:43.444
Mm-hmm.

06:43.479 --> 06:44.912
Oh, boy.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.849
I know.
Isn't it delicious?

06:47.883 --> 06:50.218
Okay, who do we
talk to first?

06:50.253 --> 06:52.552
Mm. Okay.

06:56.391 --> 06:58.191
I know this is difficult Miss Reed,

06:58.192 --> 07:00.027
but if we could ask you,
a few questions.

07:01.061 --> 07:02.562
How long did you know
Mr. Parker?

07:04.096 --> 07:05.030
Parker?

07:05.165 --> 07:06.597
Sam.

07:06.632 --> 07:09.166
His name's Jake.
Jake Holland.

07:09.401 --> 07:11.502
Um...

07:11.536 --> 07:13.937
According to his, uh,
driver's license,

07:13.971 --> 07:15.138
It's Sam Parker.

07:16.073 --> 07:19.442
It was all a lie...
even his name?

07:21.476 --> 07:22.743
Where did the two of you meet?

07:23.178 --> 07:23.978
At work.

07:24.012 --> 07:26.881
A-a girlfriend of mine said
that there was this great guy

07:26.915 --> 07:29.316
in her department,
and did I want to meet him.

07:29.551 --> 07:31.685
- And when did you two last speak?
- This afternoon.

07:31.820 --> 07:34.154
He called to say he was
on his way back to the city.

07:34.289 --> 07:36.390
His father is
in the hospital upstate.

07:36.424 --> 07:38.525
He has late-stage Alzheimer's,

07:38.559 --> 07:40.761
and Jake would drive up
to see him every...

07:43.696 --> 07:45.831
I'm so stupid.

07:47.265 --> 07:49.533
He was spending
the weekends with...

07:49.567 --> 07:52.002
His wife.

07:52.536 --> 07:55.872
So you were intending
to see him tonight?

07:56.107 --> 07:57.841
We were going to get takeout
and watch a movie.

07:57.975 --> 07:59.743
A neighbor stopped me
in the hallway

07:59.777 --> 08:00.878
and told me that the police
had been there,

08:01.912 --> 08:03.813
but when I called,
nobody could tell me anything.

08:04.247 --> 08:05.481
I-I guess now I know why.

08:05.482 --> 08:07.282
Because we ID'ed him as Sam Parker.

08:07.315 --> 08:08.215
Somebody at the morgue

08:08.249 --> 08:10.984
confirmed that a body had been
picked up at his address,

08:11.019 --> 08:13.087
so I went down there.

08:15.621 --> 08:17.156
When he proposed,

08:17.191 --> 08:19.658
I told my best friend,
and she was all,

08:19.792 --> 08:22.193
"you've only known him
six months."

08:22.528 --> 08:24.696
But I didn't care.

08:25.230 --> 08:26.998
He was the one.

08:29.067 --> 08:30.500
How could he do this?

08:31.334 --> 08:33.903
This is insane. Who is this woman?

08:34.236 --> 08:37.272
Sam would never.
He... he loved me.

08:37.506 --> 08:39.707
Our kids meant everything to him.

08:39.741 --> 08:41.110
Apparently there was more to it

08:41.144 --> 08:42.945
than just the affair, Mrs. Parker.

08:43.078 --> 08:45.380
Your husband was using
a false name at his job.

08:45.414 --> 08:48.015
W-well, I don't understand.
Why would he do that?

08:48.016 --> 08:49.116
We're still trying
to figure that out.

08:49.150 --> 08:51.951
But from what we understand,
he met Ms. Reed at his office.

08:52.785 --> 08:54.954
He... he started there
about six months ago.

08:55.988 --> 08:59.526
He had been passed over
for promotion at his old firm.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.694
And there are not
a lot of opportunities

09:01.728 --> 09:02.528
in green solutions, so

09:03.663 --> 09:06.064
he took the job
even though it was in the city.

09:06.098 --> 09:08.433
Green solutions as in
environmentally conscious?

09:08.467 --> 09:09.867
He did corporate consulting...

09:10.702 --> 09:13.270
How to reduce waste, save energy.

09:14.305 --> 09:15.839
It was a passion of his.

09:16.173 --> 09:17.440
That's very commendable.

09:17.674 --> 09:19.008
Well, all that working and commuting

09:19.042 --> 09:22.176
were running him ragged,
so he found a cheap sublet.

09:22.311 --> 09:25.345
It was hard,
but if it all worked out,

09:25.680 --> 09:27.113
we were gonna move
down to the city

09:27.148 --> 09:28.615
So that we could all be together.

09:29.450 --> 09:31.883
Mrs. Parker, did you have any idea

09:31.918 --> 09:33.352
that your husband
was having an affair?

09:33.786 --> 09:34.720
I know what you're thinking.

09:35.554 --> 09:37.188
Why didn't I notice the signs?

09:38.422 --> 09:41.356
We have two children together.
We do not have a nanny.

09:41.390 --> 09:43.757
So every second
of every minute of my day

09:43.792 --> 09:44.926
is about my kids.

09:46.060 --> 09:47.029
And if the was an issue,

09:47.163 --> 09:48.631
I'd call Sam on his cell phone,

09:48.665 --> 09:51.166
and he would always answer.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.534
I never...

09:55.569 --> 09:56.870
Never thought I'd be sitting here

09:56.904 --> 09:58.138
justifying my marriage.

09:58.939 --> 09:59.939
With the wife,

09:59.972 --> 10:02.606
it was "only call my cell
during the week" routine.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.241
With the fiancÃ©e,
he pulled out the trusty

10:04.275 --> 10:05.878
"I can't call you
from the hospital" act.

10:06.079 --> 10:07.379
Man, my girlfriend freaks out

10:07.412 --> 10:09.379
if I don't check in, like,
every hour.

10:09.613 --> 10:12.214
You do check in, like, every hour.

10:12.248 --> 10:13.281
Sometimes more.

10:13.316 --> 10:15.684
This guy had both
of these women believing

10:15.719 --> 10:17.289
that they were his one and only.

10:17.490 --> 10:18.990
People believe
what they want to believe.

10:19.323 --> 10:20.423
Till the dead truth sets in.

10:20.524 --> 10:22.124
What, you think one of 'em
caught on to what Sam was doing?

10:22.158 --> 10:23.824
And didn't take too kindly
when they discovered

10:23.858 --> 10:25.226
they weren't the only woman
in his life.

10:25.261 --> 10:28.595
Mm. I don't know. They seem
pretty shocked to me.

10:28.596 --> 10:29.796
Yeah. To me, too.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.597
But we gotta cover all of our bases.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.432
Both of them had soft alibis.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.767
The wife said that she was
watching TV while the kids

10:35.802 --> 10:36.769
were upstairs sleeping,

10:36.803 --> 10:38.937
and the fiancÃ©e said that
she was home alone

10:38.972 --> 10:39.906
getting ready to meet him.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.707
We'll run phone and financials,
see if anything pops.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.075
Thank you.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.076
Could I run...

10:44.078 --> 10:46.078
Right.

10:46.510 --> 10:48.111
Do you think he would've
gone through with it?

10:48.345 --> 10:49.579
Through with what?

10:50.013 --> 10:51.980
Marrying Sarah,
if he hadn't gotten killed.

10:52.015 --> 10:55.416
Well, that was a pretty big rock
he put on her finger.

10:55.450 --> 10:57.017
With the fake identity
he had set up,

10:57.052 --> 10:58.652
the county clerk's office
never would've flagged him

10:58.687 --> 11:00.054
for someone
who was already married.

11:00.188 --> 11:02.856
Yeah, but Sam was pretending
to be Jake before he met Sarah.

11:03.390 --> 11:05.191
I don't understand
the fake identity.

11:05.325 --> 11:06.226
Maybe to land the job.

11:06.227 --> 11:07.827
I understand fibbing
on your résumé

11:07.861 --> 11:08.894
but changing your identity?

11:09.029 --> 11:10.230
The math doesn't quite
add up for me.

11:10.231 --> 11:11.731
You know what math
doesn't add up for me?

11:11.764 --> 11:13.165
- Hmm.
- Two wives.

11:13.199 --> 11:15.267
- One wife too many for you?
- Two wives too many.

11:15.501 --> 11:17.369
Seems like the common
denominator in that equation

11:17.403 --> 11:18.470
is you.

11:19.205 --> 11:25.041
(Regina Spektor's
"The Calculation" playing)

11:25.075 --> 11:27.210
♪ you went into
the kitchen cupboard ♪

11:27.244 --> 11:29.644
♪ got yourself another hour ♪

11:29.679 --> 11:31.545
♪ and you gave... ♪

11:31.580 --> 11:33.014
Good news.

11:33.081 --> 11:34.982
I'm finally embracing
the lecture you gave me

11:35.017 --> 11:37.118
on the importance
of organic food.

11:37.152 --> 11:38.786
You made my lunch?

11:38.820 --> 11:40.787
You think I'm gonna let you
risk your life

11:40.822 --> 11:42.755
on the vending machines
and stale doughnuts

11:42.790 --> 11:43.889
Of the break r...

11:46.123 --> 11:47.157
Wow.

11:47.191 --> 11:48.491
What?

11:48.525 --> 11:51.327
You look so...
Grown-up.

11:52.662 --> 11:53.128
Really?

11:53.163 --> 11:53.930
Really.

11:54.264 --> 11:56.865
Well, gram said
presentation is vital.

11:56.866 --> 11:57.866
Well...

11:59.235 --> 12:00.503
Oh, I forgot my phone.

12:03.938 --> 12:05.739
That ever happen to you
with me?

12:05.773 --> 12:08.641
One day, you look and you see
your boy is all grown-up?

12:08.875 --> 12:10.943
I'm still waiting
for that moment, actually.

12:11.377 --> 12:13.512
I set you up for that,
didn't I?

12:15.546 --> 12:17.814
Okay, so this is
the property room.

12:17.849 --> 12:18.983
It's where we keep
all the items

12:19.017 --> 12:20.518
that we find at crime scenes

12:20.552 --> 12:22.619
that aren't classified as evidence.

12:23.453 --> 12:24.587
Sort of like a lost and found?

12:25.122 --> 12:26.789
Um, sort of.

12:26.823 --> 12:29.359
Why don't the victims' families
claim this stuff?

12:29.393 --> 12:31.461
Well, loved ones are aware
of the big-ticket items,

12:31.495 --> 12:33.095
like rings and watches.

12:33.130 --> 12:34.730
But things like sunglasses
and lighters,

12:34.765 --> 12:36.100
those usually go unclaimed.

12:36.601 --> 12:38.901
Are these case numbers?

12:38.934 --> 12:41.135
Exactly. So the idea is
to get rid of

12:41.169 --> 12:42.870
all of this stuff
and stick it into storage.

12:42.904 --> 12:44.771
But before we do that,
we have to catalog it

12:44.805 --> 12:46.207
just in case someone comes in
with a claim.

12:46.208 --> 12:48.308
Okay, so you need
a description of every item,

12:48.341 --> 12:49.675
along with its
corresponding case number

12:49.709 --> 12:50.811
downloaded into the database.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.112
Mm-hmm. And I know
that this isn't exactly

12:53.245 --> 12:54.913
what you were thinking of
when you asked to volunteer,

12:54.947 --> 12:57.115
but we're low on manpower,
and this would be very helpful.

12:57.349 --> 12:58.649
Don't worry about it.
This place is gonna be

12:58.784 --> 13:00.452
So organized when I'm done,
you won'even recognize it.

13:00.453 --> 13:01.453
I bet I won't.

13:02.886 --> 13:04.653
- Detective Beckett.
- Huh?

13:04.688 --> 13:06.988
I know my dad
can sometimes be a handful.

13:07.023 --> 13:09.190
And by "sometimes,"
I mean all the time.

13:09.225 --> 13:11.093
but I want to let you know you
don't have to worry about me.

13:11.527 --> 13:12.561
I'm all about
getting the job done.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.568
- Beckett.
- Sir.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.069
Well?

13:24.104 --> 13:26.438
Alexis? She's fine.

13:26.572 --> 13:28.106
You know, her first day
of preschool,

13:28.140 --> 13:29.775
I hid outside in the bushes all day

13:29.809 --> 13:30.910
just to make sure
she was all right.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.511
The first time my son
went to summer camp,

13:32.546 --> 13:34.547
I followed the bus
all the way to the Adirondacks.

13:35.581 --> 13:38.582
You two are both either
very sweet or very creepy.

13:39.717 --> 13:41.551
Super let us into
Sam Parker's apartment.

13:41.552 --> 13:43.652
- Jake Holland's apartment.
- Same guy, bro.

13:43.686 --> 13:45.553
Yeah, just trying to
keep it straight for everyone.

13:45.587 --> 13:48.156
Anyway, there was no signs of
a struggle, and Sam's bag was...

13:48.157 --> 13:49.257
Jake's bag.

13:50.191 --> 13:51.959
Still sitting by the door
from when he came home

13:51.993 --> 13:53.428
from visiting his family
in Connecticut.

13:53.529 --> 13:55.729
Which explains why we found
the Sam Parker wallet

13:55.763 --> 13:56.830
on him when he was killed,

13:56.864 --> 13:59.133
as opposed to this one
we found in his dresser.

13:59.334 --> 14:00.534
Jake Holland's wallet.

14:00.767 --> 14:01.934
It's got his driver's license

14:02.068 --> 14:05.404
with his New York address,
work I.D.... the whole shebang

14:05.405 --> 14:06.405
Oh, please tell me

14:06.438 --> 14:08.639
that's the old double-sided
picture frame gag.

14:08.674 --> 14:12.075
The lovely fiancÃ©e, which can
easily be swapped out for...

14:12.109 --> 14:13.509
The wife and kids

14:13.577 --> 14:15.211
should they ever visit daddy
in the big city.

14:15.545 --> 14:17.779
The big news is, we found this
sitting on the kitchen counter.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.614
There's a voice mail
you're gonna want to hear.

14:20.649 --> 14:21.951
I'm not gonna let you
get away with this,

14:21.986 --> 14:23.320
you worthless piece of trash.

14:23.387 --> 14:24.922
If you don't call me back tonight,

14:25.056 --> 14:26.791
Then my next call is to Helen.

14:26.792 --> 14:28.392
Someone caught on
to Sam's double life.

14:28.425 --> 14:31.060
Ran the number. Belongs to
one Charles Depetro.

14:31.061 --> 14:32.961
Depetro, that's his wife's maiden name.

14:33.094 --> 14:34.696
It's hyphenated
on her driver's license.

14:34.730 --> 14:37.797
Mm-hmm.
Charlie is Helen's brother.

14:37.832 --> 14:39.167
He found out what Sam was up to.

14:39.168 --> 14:41.268
And decided to take out the trash.

14:43.875 --> 14:46.207
Mr. Depetro, I can understand
the instinct of protection.

14:46.342 --> 14:48.843
If I had a sister and her
husband was cheating on her,

14:48.877 --> 14:50.144
I'd want to set him straight, too.

14:50.145 --> 14:51.745
That's not why I left the message.

14:51.778 --> 14:53.413
Did you know that Sam
was cheating on Helen?

14:53.414 --> 14:55.914
Not until she called me last night
and told me he'd been killed.

14:55.947 --> 14:57.581
Then what did you mean
when you said,

14:57.616 --> 14:59.451
"I won't let you
get away with this"?

14:59.452 --> 15:00.652
He owed me money.

15:00.985 --> 15:04.020
So Sam borrowed money
from you?

15:04.055 --> 15:06.489
20 g's. He needed it
to cover the mortgage.

15:06.524 --> 15:08.625
He had already borrowed against
the equity in the house.

15:08.959 --> 15:10.427
And what was the arrangement?

15:10.528 --> 15:11.728
He said he needed a couple months.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.662
When he started the new job
in the city,

15:13.697 --> 15:15.064
I figured he'd be making more dough.

15:15.065 --> 15:16.265
Helen didn't know about this?

15:16.399 --> 15:18.900
He didn't want her to worry,
and as long as he paid me back,

15:19.034 --> 15:20.369
I said it'd be our secret.

15:20.370 --> 15:22.270
And did he pay any of it back?

15:21.403 --> 15:25.537
Not a cent. He kept saying
he was pulling in less money.

15:25.572 --> 15:26.773
I thought he was lying.

15:26.907 --> 15:29.507
Why take the job that far
from home and force Helen

15:29.542 --> 15:30.543
To deal with the kids on her own?

15:31.677 --> 15:33.745
Comes out now he wasn't
doing it for his family.

15:34.779 --> 15:37.114
He wanted the freedom
to cheat on my sister.

15:39.148 --> 15:40.615
Brother's alibi checked out.

15:40.649 --> 15:43.251
He was was working late
when sam/Jake was shot.

15:43.285 --> 15:44.753
Any word on Parkers' financials?

15:44.754 --> 15:45.654
Yeah, they're a paycheck away

15:45.688 --> 15:47.156
from defaulting on their mortgage.

15:47.157 --> 15:48.757
You know, the brother said
that Sam was pulling in

15:48.790 --> 15:51.393
less money at his new job.
If Sam was strapped for cash,

15:51.427 --> 15:53.729
why would he quit the job he had
to take one that paid less?

15:53.863 --> 15:56.197
Didn't his wife say he was
passed over for a promotion?

15:56.331 --> 15:57.700
Maybe it was a pride thing.

15:57.701 --> 16:00.801
Yeah, but you factor in
the sublet not to mention gas,

16:00.835 --> 16:02.469
That's a high price to pay for pride.

16:01.803 --> 16:05.271
Yeah, well, never underestimate
the fragility of the male ego.

16:05.305 --> 16:06.640
Oh, see?
That's just a stereo...

16:06.641 --> 16:07.541
Don't, don't. That's...

16:07.574 --> 16:09.741
She is baiting us, all right?

16:09.776 --> 16:11.344
Just ignore her.
She'll lose her witchy powers.

16:12.245 --> 16:12.945
You wish.

16:12.979 --> 16:15.147
All right. Let's go off
to Parker's office.

16:19.016 --> 16:19.850
Lose something?

16:20.084 --> 16:22.019
Um... Where... where, uh...

16:22.554 --> 16:23.754
Where's my broom?

16:23.888 --> 16:25.989
ha.
Yeah.

16:26.023 --> 16:27.290
I was looking.

16:29.025 --> 16:30.259
For the record,
I did not.

16:31.894 --> 16:33.162
I don't know.
Maybe I should've seen it.

16:33.396 --> 16:35.930
His résumé was almost
too good to be true...

16:35.964 --> 16:39.366
Top of his class at Berkeley,
Stanford Business School.

16:39.901 --> 16:42.501
He must have really needed
this job to lie so bad.

16:42.636 --> 16:45.070
So there's no other reason you
can think of as to why he lied?

16:45.105 --> 16:46.140
No.

16:46.141 --> 16:48.341
When you hired him, did you look
into any of his references?

16:48.475 --> 16:50.776
Of course I did, Detective.
I called them all myself.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.078
And I got nothing
but glowing recommendations.

16:53.079 --> 16:54.079
For a guy who didn't exist.

16:54.113 --> 16:56.347
I'd like to take a look
at a copy of his résumé

16:56.381 --> 16:57.015
if you still have it.

16:57.049 --> 16:59.117
I'll have human resources
e-mail it over to you.

16:59.951 --> 17:02.087
Uh, before we go,
did you know that Mr. Parker

17:02.121 --> 17:04.223
was romantically involved
with one of your employees?

17:04.257 --> 17:08.826
Sarah. Yeah, she's...
one of my best engineers.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.161
Ever notice any drama there.

17:10.395 --> 17:12.330
Drunken fighting at an office
party, that sort of thing?

17:12.332 --> 17:13.432
No, never.

17:13.464 --> 17:15.366
They actually seemed like
a pretty solid couple.

17:15.900 --> 17:17.702
And she must be
going through hell right now.

17:19.839 --> 17:20.839
We're sorry.

17:20.872 --> 17:22.840
The number you have reached
is not in service.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.344
Please check the number
or try your call...

17:26.345 --> 17:27.345
that's the last one.

17:27.377 --> 17:29.613
Every single reference he gave
is suddenly out of service?

17:29.614 --> 17:30.514
When, according to his boss,

17:30.547 --> 17:31.914
they were all up and running
six months ago?

17:33.015 --> 17:33.615
So who was answering
the dummy lines?

17:34.348 --> 17:35.678
Let's get a warrant
for all these numbers.

17:35.813 --> 17:37.046
I'd like to know
who they were registered to.

17:37.081 --> 17:37.713
Ok.

17:41.482 --> 17:42.816
This guy went to
so pretty serious lengths

17:42.851 --> 17:43.618
to get this job.

17:44.452 --> 17:46.020
They must have amazing dental.

17:47.354 --> 17:47.921
Eww.

17:48.456 --> 17:50.323
I don't know where you got
this work ethic,

17:50.357 --> 17:52.492
but it certainly was not from me.

17:53.026 --> 17:53.926
How's it going?

17:54.060 --> 17:56.162
Pretty good. The computer was
a little glitchy at first,

17:56.196 --> 17:57.931
but that's because no e
had run a software update

17:57.965 --> 17:58.698
in, like, two years.

17:58.733 --> 18:01.100
Plus, it picked up
some viruses I had to zap.

18:00.934 --> 18:04.402
I am realizing that you are
way overqualified for this job.

18:04.436 --> 18:05.671
Told you she was a smarty.

18:05.805 --> 18:06.939
But I do have one question.

18:07.073 --> 18:08.207
Like you said before,

18:08.241 --> 18:10.642
Most of the items here are
pretty junky and meaningless.

18:11.476 --> 18:12.410
I did find this, though.

18:15.144 --> 18:17.779
Oh, it's a brag book. So you
can brag about your kids.

18:17.813 --> 18:19.681
I used to have one in my wallet.
Now it's on my phone.

18:19.815 --> 18:21.416
Some of the pictures
are really old,

18:21.450 --> 18:22.651
Like they're one of a kind.

18:22.985 --> 18:24.252
It seems like something
worth returning,

18:24.287 --> 18:26.122
Only it wasn't tagged or anything.

18:26.123 --> 18:28.223
Yeah, but the problem is,
is without a case number,

18:28.256 --> 18:30.057
It's difficult to find out
who the victim was

18:30.092 --> 18:31.559
and how to get this back
to the family.

18:33.194 --> 18:35.994
Okay. So then it just goes
in the storage box, right?

18:36.728 --> 18:38.629
I'll tell you what..
I'll give you a list

18:38.663 --> 18:41.231
of all the Detectives
who possibly worked this case.

18:41.565 --> 18:43.766
Show them the pictures.
Maybe it'll strike up a memory.

18:43.801 --> 18:45.704
Only don't bother them
if they seem busy.

18:45.705 --> 18:46.705
You're one to talk.

18:46.838 --> 18:48.171
Thanks so much.

18:48.205 --> 18:49.640
mm-hmm. Excuse me.

18:49.674 --> 18:51.177
Beckett.

18:51.211 --> 18:53.978
- Hmm. What's this?
- Dad!

18:54.013 --> 18:56.080
Okay, I'll be right there.

18:57.414 --> 18:59.016
The fiancÃ©e's here.
She wants to talk.

18:59.450 --> 19:01.184
Have fun.

19:05.689 --> 19:07.289
I knew she looked familiar
at the morgue,

19:07.324 --> 19:08.525
but I couldn't place it at first.

19:08.526 --> 19:10.326
So you're saying
that last night

19:10.359 --> 19:12.527
Wasn't the first time
you had seen Helen Parker?

19:12.528 --> 19:14.028
Well, there was something
about her face.

19:14.061 --> 19:16.329
And then it hit me...
I had seen her

19:16.363 --> 19:18.164
in front of Jake's apartment
a couple weeks ago.

19:18.299 --> 19:19.699
Was she leaving the building?

19:19.734 --> 19:21.568
No, she was sitting
in her car across the street.

19:21.903 --> 19:23.604
And you're sure it was Helen Parker?

19:23.605 --> 19:24.805
I'm sure of it now.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.238
A positive identification

19:26.373 --> 19:28.341
from all the way
across the street in a car?

19:28.375 --> 19:30.410
I made a note of it because
the way she was staring at me

19:30.444 --> 19:33.378
was... creepy,
like she was sizing me up.

19:34.512 --> 19:37.014
Ms. Reed, the past 24 hours
have been...

19:37.248 --> 19:39.283
overwhelming to say the least.

19:39.318 --> 19:41.884
It's not uncommon
for witnesses' memories

19:41.919 --> 19:44.320
to be confused
after a traumatic event.

19:44.354 --> 19:45.922
We just need to be absolutely sure.

19:46.056 --> 19:47.756
Look, I know what I saw.

19:48.291 --> 19:49.991
She was sitting in a silver Hybrid

19:50.125 --> 19:51.728
staring at the front
of the building.

19:52.429 --> 19:54.329
And did you tell your fiancÃ©e
about this?

19:54.362 --> 19:55.929
No. At the time,
I just dismissed it.

19:55.964 --> 19:59.465
But now...
it makes me wonder

19:59.499 --> 20:01.200
if I'm the only person
in the whole situation

20:00.534 --> 20:02.702
Who didn't know
what was really going on.

20:04.000 --> 20:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:11.177 --> 20:12.112
Silver Hybrid.

20:12.346 --> 20:14.080
I guess Helen did know
about her husband's affair.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.415
That would be
a pretty strong motive.

20:19.149 --> 20:21.651
You came all this way because
she told you some crazy story

20:21.685 --> 20:23.320
about me being parked outside
the apartment?

20:23.354 --> 20:26.222
Mrs. Parker, we have to take
every lead seriously.

20:26.556 --> 20:29.257
Did you ever think that maybe
she made this up

20:29.291 --> 20:30.925
to take the attention
off of herself?

20:30.959 --> 20:34.028
- She was specific about your car.
- A silver Hybrid? That's...

20:34.462 --> 20:36.596
that's like saying somebody
was wearing black shoes.

20:37.333 --> 20:39.035
That still doesn't answer
the question.

20:40.969 --> 20:41.970
No.

20:43.104 --> 20:45.106
In the six months
Sam had the apartment,

20:46.441 --> 20:47.275
I never went there.

20:47.509 --> 20:49.677
You never popped down
just once for a date night?

20:49.711 --> 20:51.546
I mean, Connecticut's
not that far a drive.

20:52.580 --> 20:54.782
Well, when you have 2 children
under the age of 10,

20:54.816 --> 20:57.018
popping down for date night
midweek is...

20:57.552 --> 20:59.753
Nearly impossible.

21:00.388 --> 21:02.722
Sam came home every weekend,

21:02.756 --> 21:03.857
and I would see him then.

21:04.991 --> 21:06.659
Okay, well,
we just needed to check.

21:06.693 --> 21:08.627
It's possible that Ms. Reed
was mistaken.

21:08.961 --> 21:10.963
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe she was the one

21:10.997 --> 21:12.332
that knew he was lying?

21:13.766 --> 21:15.433
We're considering
every scenario.

21:15.568 --> 21:17.501
We got a lot of hang-ups
last month.

21:17.536 --> 21:18.836
Do you think that's a coincidence?

21:18.871 --> 21:20.272
Did you tell Sam about it?

21:20.273 --> 21:22.073
I did. He said
it was telemarketers. But...

21:23.107 --> 21:24.074
it... it was her.

21:24.308 --> 21:25.309
How can you be sure?

21:25.610 --> 21:26.810
I know she has our phone number.

21:26.843 --> 21:28.811
She's called since Sam was killed.

21:28.846 --> 21:29.750
Sarah called you?

21:30.051 --> 21:31.751
She called about
the funeral details.

21:31.784 --> 21:32.954
Can you believe that?

21:33.188 --> 21:34.324
If she thinks she's gonna
show her face here,

21:34.358 --> 21:35.728
she is sadly mistaken.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.629
Was that the only time
you heard from Sarah?

21:37.762 --> 21:40.763
No, she... she called this morning
and left some ridiculous message

21:40.797 --> 21:43.532
about getting things back
from Sam that she had given him,

21:43.567 --> 21:45.068
and then on and on about some pen

21:45.102 --> 21:46.404
that had been her grandfather's.

21:47.938 --> 21:51.173
We were married for ten years
and eight months.

21:52.007 --> 21:53.575
If she thinks
that her 6-month affair

21:53.609 --> 21:54.845
can hold a candle to that...

21:56.379 --> 21:57.747
I'm not giving her anything.

21:59.481 --> 22:01.416
That was a long drive.

22:01.951 --> 22:03.785
I can see why he got
the apartment in the city.

22:04.020 --> 22:07.422
So... I did some background
on Parker's job situation.

22:07.856 --> 22:09.123
Turns out that his old employer,

22:09.158 --> 22:11.992
Connecticut Solutions,
has been circling the drain.

22:12.026 --> 22:13.827
Over the last couple of years,
they've lost

22:13.862 --> 22:15.696
half their market share
to his new employer,

22:15.730 --> 22:16.765
New York Recycle.

22:17.266 --> 22:19.066
Sounds like Sam was
abandoning a sinking ship.

22:19.299 --> 22:20.199
To join the winning team.

22:20.234 --> 22:23.002
Supposedly New York Recycle
came up with some new technology

22:23.037 --> 22:24.471
that turned out to be
a game changer.

22:24.805 --> 22:27.473
Apparently these two CEO's
have been major rivals from day one.

22:27.707 --> 22:30.542
Like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs,
Kobe and Lebron...

22:31.277 --> 22:32.611
Jolie and Aniston.

22:32.645 --> 22:34.346
We get the picture. Rivals.

22:34.380 --> 22:37.215
Yes. My point was, maybe that
why Sam faked his résumé.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.885
He didn't think that
New York Recycle would hire him

22:38.919 --> 22:40.954
if they knew he was from
Connecticut Solutions.

22:41.555 --> 22:42.555
Well, that makes sense.

22:43.289 --> 22:44.023
Thank you.
no way.

22:44.058 --> 22:45.425
You're kidding me.

22:47.459 --> 22:48.825
Uh, thank you.
You've been very helpful.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.126
Hey, the warrants just
came through on the numbers

22:51.161 --> 22:53.529
on Sam's résumé.
His references' phone numbers?

22:53.563 --> 22:55.029
They're all billed
and registered

22:55.064 --> 22:56.865
to Connecticut Solutions,
his old firm.

22:57.399 --> 22:58.798
Okay, why would they set up

22:58.833 --> 23:00.931
dummy phone lines
and give phony recommendations?

23:01.332 --> 23:03.032
They wanted Sam to get hired.

23:04.066 --> 23:05.600
He wasn't passed over
for a promotion.

23:06.334 --> 23:08.302
He was planted
at New York Recycle

23:08.336 --> 23:10.171
as a corporate spy.

23:13.626 --> 23:14.326
I'm sorry.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.562
I'm just trying to get
my head around this idea.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.730
I mean, this is the guy who
organized the potato sack race

23:19.764 --> 23:20.799
at the labor day picnic.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.300
Well, there's considerable
circumstantial evidence

23:23.366 --> 23:25.433
that he was planted here
by his former employer.

23:25.468 --> 23:27.370
We just don't have
the proof yet.

23:27.371 --> 23:29.471
Well, obviously, no one wants
to get to the bottom of this

23:29.504 --> 23:30.104
more than I do.

23:30.139 --> 23:31.840
So you'll have
our complete cooperation.

23:32.074 --> 23:34.276
What do you think
Connecticut Solutions was after?

23:34.277 --> 23:36.177
It's our
battery recycling technology.

23:36.211 --> 23:37.711
I'm sure you both know
you're not supposed to dump

23:37.746 --> 23:39.580
your batteries
in with your trash.

23:39.614 --> 23:41.448
Batteries need to be
disposed of properly,

23:41.483 --> 23:44.352
or else the acids and the heavy
metals will leech out into...

23:44.386 --> 23:46.387
- And get into the water table.
- Exactly, yes.

23:46.422 --> 23:49.589
The problem is, storing battery
sludge can be quite expensive

23:49.624 --> 23:52.425
but we figured out a way
to actually recycle the stuff.

23:52.459 --> 23:55.027
So when you bid on a contract
to haul away old batteries,

23:55.061 --> 23:55.695
you can do it cheaper.

23:55.696 --> 23:57.496
Which is why Connecticut Solutions

23:57.529 --> 23:59.163
lost half of
its market share to you.

23:59.498 --> 24:00.965
The bottom line is,
they can't compete.

24:00.999 --> 24:03.133
Was Sarah Reed on the team
of engineers

24:03.168 --> 24:05.235
- that developed that technology?
- Yeah, that's right.

24:05.270 --> 24:07.137
Well, that's probably why
Sam Parker went out of his way

24:07.272 --> 24:09.441
To romance her... for access.
That's pretty smart.

24:09.442 --> 24:11.642
Pardon me,
but don't you mean despicable?

24:11.675 --> 24:13.043
The two aren't mutually exclusive.

24:13.044 --> 24:14.544
Would you mind
if our forensic IT Team

24:14.577 --> 24:17.745
took a look at Sarah's computer
and Sam's... Jake's... as well?

24:17.779 --> 24:18.980
They should be able to tell us

24:18.914 --> 24:20.348
whether your security
was compromised

24:20.382 --> 24:22.283
and whether he got ahold
of anything proprietary.

24:22.284 --> 24:23.584
Anything we can do to help.

24:24.150 --> 24:24.950
Okay, thanks.

24:25.384 --> 24:28.085
Forensic IT has taken possession
of Sarah and Sam's computers

24:28.119 --> 24:29.455
You know, there's a lot
of corporate secrets

24:29.489 --> 24:30.923
I could see
sending a spy to steal,

24:30.958 --> 24:32.992
but all this skulking around
for some battery sludge?

24:32.993 --> 24:36.193
Well, like the man said,
it's a business like any other.

24:36.226 --> 24:38.395
But whoever runs
Connecticut Solutions

24:38.429 --> 24:40.597
is gonna have a hell of a lot
of explaining to do.

24:42.699 --> 24:43.734
Is it true?

24:45.569 --> 24:46.602
Ms. Reed?

24:46.637 --> 24:48.371
What they're saying, is it true?

24:49.705 --> 24:51.273
Look, I can't go into details,

24:51.307 --> 24:54.341
but there's evidence that Jake
was trying to steal information.

24:55.776 --> 24:57.276
Then it was all an act?

24:58.511 --> 25:00.712
Now that... that doesn't mean
he didn't care about you.

25:02.246 --> 25:03.448
That's exactly what it means.

25:04.682 --> 25:06.315
He never loved me.

25:06.350 --> 25:08.551
He was just using me
the whole time.

25:14.021 --> 25:15.389
This guy was good.

25:15.423 --> 25:16.758
He was running
a secret e-mail client

25:16.793 --> 25:18.962
From inside a hidden partition
in his hard drive.

25:19.063 --> 25:19.963
English?

25:19.996 --> 25:21.231
For my partner here.

25:22.132 --> 25:22.932
He set things up so that

25:22.965 --> 25:24.634
he could send e-mails
outside of the company network

25:24.668 --> 25:26.237
In case anyone
ever came snooping.

25:26.438 --> 25:27.638
What kind of e-mails?

25:27.771 --> 25:29.473
I speak computer.

25:29.507 --> 25:30.875
This however...

25:30.909 --> 25:33.276
looks like chemistry.

25:33.310 --> 25:34.911
Was he communicating with
anyone in particular?

25:34.912 --> 25:35.912
Yeah.

25:35.946 --> 25:38.216
All these-mails were to the same guy.

25:39.150 --> 25:41.853
Aberman@conn-sol.Net.

25:44.855 --> 25:47.556
Andy Berman. He's the CEO
of Connecticut Solutions.

25:47.590 --> 25:49.224
He must have been
who Sam was reporting to.

25:49.358 --> 25:51.093
They exchanged a bunch of
e-mails a couple months ago,

25:51.327 --> 25:53.262
Then nothing till the night
Sam was killed.

25:53.263 --> 25:54.263
And what'd that one say?

25:54.396 --> 25:55.898
"Call me. We need to talk."

25:57.532 --> 25:58.500
Okay, yes, it's true.

25:58.534 --> 26:00.602
Sam e-mailed me the other night,
and I called him.

26:00.803 --> 26:01.803
From a pay phone?

26:02.136 --> 26:03.837
At a gas station near my house.

26:04.071 --> 26:05.273
Very cloak and dagger of you.

26:05.274 --> 26:06.774
He said he needed to
meet me in the city.

26:06.807 --> 26:08.141
He said he finally figured out

26:08.175 --> 26:09.809
how New York Recycle
was pulling it off.

26:09.844 --> 26:11.411
So you admit
that you planted him there

26:11.446 --> 26:13.081
to steal their battery technology?

26:13.082 --> 26:14.882
They've been underbidding us
left and right,

26:14.916 --> 26:15.983
Stealing our business.

26:16.818 --> 26:18.385
Getting our hands
on their recycling method

26:18.420 --> 26:19.988
was a way to level
the playing field.

26:20.022 --> 26:22.823
They weren't gonna share it,
so I offered Sam

26:22.857 --> 26:25.992
a $1-million payday
if he could get ahold of it.

26:26.027 --> 26:28.128
And when he called and said
he completed his mission,

26:28.162 --> 26:29.998
You rushed right over.

26:30.399 --> 26:33.199
The thing about Sam is, he and I
had been down this road before.

26:33.232 --> 26:36.800
What do you mean? He...
he'd told you he'd found it before?

26:36.835 --> 26:40.004
I wasted hundreds of thousands
on research and development

26:40.138 --> 26:41.106
With the stuff he brought me.

26:41.140 --> 26:43.042
The chemical formulas
were never complete.

26:43.176 --> 26:45.244
So when my engineers
tried to fill in the blanks

26:45.278 --> 26:46.946
and test them,
we failed every time.

26:47.080 --> 26:49.448
Finally, we ran out of money,
so a couple of months ago,

26:49.482 --> 26:50.751
I had to cut Sam loose.

26:51.552 --> 26:54.652
If sam wasn't working for you,
what was he calling about?

26:54.686 --> 26:56.221
He said he needed
to show me something.

26:56.522 --> 26:57.622
- What?
- I don't know.

26:57.958 --> 26:59.860
I drove into the city to
meet him at his apartment,

26:59.894 --> 27:02.295
but as I pulled up, there were
cops all over the entrance.

27:03.329 --> 27:04.397
I got a bad feeling about it,

27:04.431 --> 27:05.732
so I turned around
and I drove home.

27:08.467 --> 27:10.235
That's very interesting story,
Mr. Berman.

27:10.269 --> 27:11.903
But I have a different ending...

27:12.738 --> 27:15.172
One where you went upstairs
to Sam's apartment

27:15.207 --> 27:18.642
and he told you that he finally
found the real thing.

27:19.377 --> 27:20.545
You said so yourself.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.482
Your company didn't have
the $1 million to pay him.

27:24.716 --> 27:26.251
So you did the one thing
that you could.

27:28.285 --> 27:30.353
You killed him and you stole it

27:30.388 --> 27:33.123
in a desperate attempt
to save your sinking company.

27:36.159 --> 27:38.495
I would like to call
my lawyer now, please.

27:40.564 --> 27:42.699
That was pretty cool, the way
you filled in the story there.

27:43.033 --> 27:44.467
I think I must brubbing off on.

27:45.202 --> 27:46.603
That sounded dirtier
than I meant it.

27:46.604 --> 27:47.604
Yo Beckett,

27:48.137 --> 27:49.739
dispatch just got a call
out of Connecticut.

27:50.173 --> 27:52.508
New Haven PD have two women
involved in an altercation.

27:52.942 --> 27:54.078
Speaking of dirty...

27:54.079 --> 27:56.279
And the ladies in question
are asking for you

27:56.312 --> 27:57.648
Before they're taken in
for booking.

27:57.649 --> 27:59.249
For me, why?

28:01.617 --> 28:03.251
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

28:03.386 --> 28:04.720
They're holding Helen Parker
for assault

28:04.754 --> 28:06.556
and Sarah Reed for trespassing.

28:06.557 --> 28:07.857
A wife and fiancÃ©e cat fight.

28:07.891 --> 28:09.726
Please tell me we can stop
for popcorn on the way.

28:12.261 --> 28:14.963
Castle.

28:15.181 --> 28:16.948
Ms. Reed was trespassing
in the detached office.

28:16.982 --> 28:19.216
When Mrs. Parker confronted her,
an altercation ensued.

28:19.250 --> 28:21.284
She tried to rip my purse
off my arm.

28:21.319 --> 28:23.086
Almost dislocated my shoulder.

28:23.120 --> 28:25.889
Ms. Reed, what were you doing
in the Parkers' office?

28:25.890 --> 28:27.690
She wouldn't give me back my pen.

28:27.923 --> 28:30.357
- Your pen?
- My grandfather's fountain pen.

28:30.392 --> 28:33.327
- I gave it to Jake wh...
- Sam! His name was Sam!

28:33.361 --> 28:35.763
I gave it to him before I knew
he was a lying sack.

28:35.798 --> 28:36.800
And she wouldn't
give it back to me.

28:36.801 --> 28:38.901
I looked for it in the office.
There was nothing there.

28:38.935 --> 28:40.402
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

28:40.437 --> 28:44.638
Oh, really? Huh. Well, then
what do you call this?

28:44.673 --> 28:45.940
That was in the office?

28:45.941 --> 28:47.741
Yes. It was right there
in the drawer.

28:47.775 --> 28:49.308
How she could've missed it,
I don't know.

28:49.342 --> 28:50.911
Unless, of course, she was lying
and never bothered to look.

28:51.345 --> 28:52.312
Ms. Reed, I understand
how you're feeling,

28:52.546 --> 28:53.980
But breaking into someone's home...

28:53.981 --> 28:55.281
No, this is my grandfather's pen.

28:55.314 --> 28:57.947
I never would've given it
to Jake if I had known.

28:57.948 --> 28:59.348
Ladies, I'm wondering

28:59.481 --> 29:02.683
If maybe we can put this
whole nasty episode behind us.

29:02.718 --> 29:05.119
She broke into my house.
God knows what else she stole.

29:06.254 --> 29:07.489
Do you mind if I take
a look at the purse?

29:07.724 --> 29:08.923
Not at all.

29:18.428 --> 29:19.596
Happy now?

29:19.630 --> 29:22.232
Is everyone okay?
Can we all just walk away?

29:24.666 --> 29:26.034
If I ever catch your face
around h...

29:26.035 --> 29:27.435
For crying out loud,
give it a rest!

29:27.468 --> 29:28.336
No wonder the guy
had an ulcer.

29:28.370 --> 29:29.538
I would, too,
if I was married to you.

29:29.539 --> 29:30.139
An ulcer?

29:30.172 --> 29:31.239
What are you talking about,
you crazy lunatic?!

29:32.373 --> 29:34.841
Look! Look! Hello.
Ladies, look!

29:37.275 --> 29:40.211
I understand that you're both
angry and feeling betrayed,

29:40.246 --> 29:41.379
but taking it out on each other

29:41.414 --> 29:42.381
isn't going to help.

29:43.215 --> 29:45.315
So you can both press charges
and make a bad thing worse

29:45.350 --> 29:47.385
or you can calm down
and walk away.

29:49.219 --> 29:51.620
Option number two
is a limited-time offer.

30:00.495 --> 30:01.195
Aw. Love you.

30:01.229 --> 30:02.863
see ya.

30:10.535 --> 30:13.068
Please tell me you did not sleep
in the break room again.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.504
I went home.

30:14.538 --> 30:15.472
I just couldn't
stop thinking about

30:15.506 --> 30:16.541
that cat fight last night.

30:16.576 --> 30:19.443
Ooh, would you think less of me
if I said me, too?

30:20.478 --> 30:23.079
I kept thinking that that was
a long way for Sarah to go

30:23.313 --> 30:24.781
Just to pick up that pen.

30:25.015 --> 30:26.416
And that whole thing
with the ulcers was,,,

30:26.417 --> 30:27.017
Oh, I know.

30:27.051 --> 30:28.584
That was a great
"Desperate Housewives" moment,

30:28.619 --> 30:30.752
The way Sarah just rubbed
Helen's face in it.

30:31.553 --> 30:32.553
The thing is,

30:32.620 --> 30:34.887
there's nothing about an ulcer
in Lanie's autopsy report.

30:34.922 --> 30:36.289
Sam had a clean bill of health.

30:37.290 --> 30:38.490
Then what was Sarah
talking about?

30:38.624 --> 30:39.992
The boys are looking
into it right now.

30:40.027 --> 30:42.863
But according to Sam's date book

30:43.097 --> 30:44.897
he had doctor's appointments
every Tuesday

30:44.932 --> 30:45.900
for the last three weeks.

30:46.901 --> 30:48.401
Well, if he was being
a hypochondriac about it,

30:48.434 --> 30:49.902
They would've told him right
away he didn't have an ulcer.

30:49.903 --> 30:51.703
So what was he doing
every Tuesday at 1:00 pm?

30:51.736 --> 30:53.170
Another woman?

30:53.204 --> 30:54.304
So the doctor's office
has no patient records

30:56.339 --> 30:57.773
for Sam Parker or Jake Holland.

30:57.808 --> 30:59.841
Car service
Sam was using confirmed

30:59.975 --> 31:01.942
that he gave the doctor's office
as his destination

31:01.976 --> 31:04.344
when he was scheduling
the cars... oh, thanks, Elise.

31:04.378 --> 31:05.512
But I talked to the drivers.

31:06.247 --> 31:08.682
Sam changed the destination
once they picked him up.

31:09.716 --> 31:10.918
The first week he headed out

31:10.953 --> 31:13.121
to this residential address
out in Long Island.

31:13.356 --> 31:15.990
The next week he drove out
to New York Recycle's

31:16.025 --> 31:17.626
Processing plant up in Paramus.

31:18.060 --> 31:20.362
And then last week,
he hit the port out in Newark.

31:20.796 --> 31:23.631
Sam wouldn't have wanted Sarah
to get on to his 007 routine.

31:23.665 --> 31:25.567
So maybe he was slipping away
to do his spying.

31:25.568 --> 31:26.768
At some house on Long Island?

31:27.001 --> 31:29.469
-So another woman.
- She and Sam were taking

31:29.503 --> 31:31.639
long, romantic walks
at Port Newark.

31:32.673 --> 31:33.674
Why you gotta ruin the dream?

31:33.908 --> 31:35.876
Listen, Sam was changing
his destination last minute

31:35.911 --> 31:37.878
with the car service because he
was trying to hide something.

31:37.912 --> 31:39.780
So let's look into the addresses

31:39.815 --> 31:42.051
and see why he felt the need
to give Sarah a cover story.

31:48.689 --> 31:51.757
Will you let me know
if you think of anyone else?

31:51.791 --> 31:55.562
Mm-hmm. Good job.

31:56.996 --> 31:58.830
State law requires
a 10-minute break

31:58.865 --> 32:00.032
every five hours.

32:00.466 --> 32:01.800
Thanks, dad. I needed this.

32:01.934 --> 32:03.768
So how goes your
property room sleuthing?

32:04.203 --> 32:05.636
Not amazing.

32:05.671 --> 32:07.238
Oh, no.
What happened to that,

32:07.272 --> 32:09.307
Uh, list of Detectives
Beckett gave you?

32:09.641 --> 32:10.943
I just hit
my last dead end.

32:11.678 --> 32:14.346
Oh, well, what's important is,
is that, uh, you tried.

32:14.480 --> 32:15.447
I know.

32:15.881 --> 32:17.716
I just really wanted
to get those pictures

32:17.850 --> 32:18.851
back to the victim's family.

32:19.886 --> 32:22.320
I mean, I'd want them
if they were pictures

32:22.355 --> 32:23.722
that you'd carried around.

32:25.556 --> 32:27.558
If you are imagining
a scenario where I am

32:27.593 --> 32:29.828
No longer here and watching over
your every move

32:29.862 --> 32:31.663
and protecting you
from every danger,

32:31.697 --> 32:33.866
I can assure you,
that will never happen.

32:36.100 --> 32:37.334
I'm just saying,
I think it's important.

32:38.369 --> 32:40.169
No, you're right,
but remember,

32:40.203 --> 32:42.038
There's a reason why a lot
of this stuff goes unclaimed.

32:42.172 --> 32:45.241
I guess I just need
to focus on cataloging

32:45.275 --> 32:46.745
for the rest of my time here.

32:46.746 --> 32:47.746
And before you know it,

32:47.880 --> 32:49.047
you'll be retired
from law enforcement

32:49.081 --> 32:50.349
and back in the eleventh grade.

32:52.483 --> 32:53.716
Thanks, dad.

32:54.284 --> 32:55.452
For what? You're wcome.

32:55.786 --> 32:56.791
You just gave me a new lead.

32:59.626 --> 33:00.925
So I'll finish your cocoa.

33:03.559 --> 33:04.326
Two relationships.

33:04.361 --> 33:06.965
Can you imagine the stress
of trying to pull that off?

33:08.599 --> 33:09.935
Yes.

33:11.669 --> 33:13.471
Uh, from a literary point of view.

33:14.506 --> 33:15.907
Hey. What'd you guys find?

33:15.908 --> 33:17.108
Well, we canvassed
using a picture.

33:17.142 --> 33:18.943
We came up with a longshoreman
in Port Newark

33:18.977 --> 33:20.111
who remembered Sam.

33:20.145 --> 33:21.980
Apparently he'd been asking
about shipping manifests.

33:21.981 --> 33:23.281
Sounds random.

33:23.315 --> 33:25.484
The longshoreman couldn't
help him, so Sam moved on.

33:25.485 --> 33:27.185
What about the address
from the first Tuesday?

33:27.218 --> 33:28.786
Oh, here's where gets good.

33:28.820 --> 33:30.188
The Long Island address

33:30.222 --> 33:31.890
is the ridence of a single mother...

33:31.924 --> 33:33.926
Lauren Branston...
and her 6-year-old daughter.

33:33.927 --> 33:35.227
I told you it was another woman.

33:35.261 --> 33:37.430
Our love triangle
just became a love square.

33:37.664 --> 33:41.066
Nope. Still a triangle.
Different name, but that's...

33:42.101 --> 33:44.103
The fiancÃ©e, Sarah Reed.

33:45.637 --> 33:46.704
Well, it looks like Sam

33:46.739 --> 33:48.473
wasn't the only one
hiding his identity.

33:53.337 --> 33:54.971
The engagement, the relationship,

33:55.372 --> 33:56.939
we know they were all fake.

33:57.740 --> 33:59.408
Love is a hard thing
to disprove, Detective Beckett.

34:00.309 --> 34:02.945
This is a copy
of your real driver's license.

34:03.346 --> 34:05.515
And this is
your social security card.

34:06.516 --> 34:09.617
And this is the employment
record from New York Recycle

34:10.418 --> 34:12.119
Under an assumed identity.

34:12.920 --> 34:13.920
Nothing like a fresh start.

34:14.322 --> 34:15.389
We did a little digging.

34:16.090 --> 34:18.056
Turns out New York Recycle
isn't the first company

34:18.058 --> 34:19.592
you've worked for
under a new identity.

34:19.694 --> 34:20.960
A girl's gotta make a living.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.661
Here's what I'm thinking...

34:24.463 --> 34:26.965
Lance Carlberg figured out
that Sam was a spy.

34:26.966 --> 34:30.768
He contacted you, an expert
in corporate espionage,

34:31.469 --> 34:32.504
And asked you to intercept him.

34:32.605 --> 34:33.905
I was just doing my job.

34:34.005 --> 34:36.906
Leading a man on isn't
a crime, is it, Detective?

34:36.907 --> 34:37.775
Should be.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.076
I'm not looking into
the leading on part.

34:39.176 --> 34:40.176
I'm looking into a murder,

34:40.177 --> 34:41.878
And you had access
to Sam's apartment,

34:41.879 --> 34:43.581
And you were hired
to take care of him.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.882
I was hired to get in his way.

34:45.882 --> 34:46.916
It was supposed to look
like I had access

34:46.917 --> 34:47.949
to classified information.

34:47.951 --> 34:50.152
So when I struck up
a flirtation, he thought

34:50.152 --> 34:51.954
the relationship would give him
the access he needed.

34:52.955 --> 34:55.255
Once you had the relationship,
what was the plan?

34:55.257 --> 34:56.657
I just had to leave my laptop

34:56.658 --> 34:58.359
lying around his apartment
once or twice.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.561
My keycard ended up
in his laundry one weekend.

35:01.262 --> 35:02.230
Men think they're smart.

35:03.231 --> 35:04.566
The trick is to keep
letting them think it.

35:06.267 --> 35:08.834
Um... So what was on
the computer?

35:09.435 --> 35:12.236
Lance was feeding Sam these
partial chemical formulas.

35:12.237 --> 35:12.871
He thought it would keep

35:12.872 --> 35:14.640
Connecticut Solutions
going in circles.

35:16.241 --> 35:17.842
Why not kill two birds
with one stone?

35:17.843 --> 35:20.012
Keep the enemy close and run
Connecticut into the ground.

35:21.013 --> 35:22.013
And what makes you think

35:22.114 --> 35:24.315
That Sam was falling
for your routine?

35:24.716 --> 35:26.117
Well, I wondered at first,

35:26.118 --> 35:27.052
Because he wouldn't sleep with me.

35:27.153 --> 35:29.121
And then I realized that he was
being faithful to his wife.

35:29.222 --> 35:33.424
So I pretended to buy his whole
"I'm old-fashioned" thing.

35:34.125 --> 35:35.592
He thought he was playing me.

35:36.093 --> 35:37.261
He was.

35:38.262 --> 35:39.663
This is Sam's autopsy report.

35:40.464 --> 35:43.099
Hmm.
Sam didn't have an ulcer.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.134
He was seeing a doctor for it.

35:45.535 --> 35:48.137
No, that was just a story.
He made you.

35:48.138 --> 35:50.406
No way. I would've
been able to tell.

35:50.407 --> 35:53.743
Oh, I hate to burst this little
"alias" bubble you got going on,

35:54.244 --> 35:56.246
But Sam found your house
in Long Island.

35:56.247 --> 35:59.482
He knew you were more than
just a flirty engineer.

35:59.483 --> 36:01.384
He played along
not to arouse suspicion,

36:01.385 --> 36:03.220
But I think you already knew that.

36:03.721 --> 36:05.722
You knew that he made you
and that he found

36:05.723 --> 36:07.559
the secret method,
and that's why you killed him.

36:11.060 --> 36:12.995
I think that sounds like a...

36:12.996 --> 36:15.096
great spy versus spy story,

36:15.097 --> 36:16.267
but there is one problem.

36:17.668 --> 36:19.470
The night Sam was killed,
I was at my daughter's recital,

36:19.471 --> 36:21.506
and there's about 20 other
parents that can vouch for that.

36:25.109 --> 36:27.711
I like her... for the murder.

36:27.812 --> 36:28.980
You see that crazy look in her eye?

36:28.981 --> 36:30.615
That's crazy-killer look.

36:31.416 --> 36:33.518
Yo,
Sarah's alibi checks out.

36:33.519 --> 36:34.786
Dance teacher puts her
in the front row

36:34.787 --> 36:37.221
- at the time of the murder.
- She's still got crazy eyes.

36:37.222 --> 36:38.788
He never loved her,
she never loved him,

36:38.789 --> 36:40.523
and they both thought that
they were playing each other.

36:40.524 --> 36:42.324
Which still doesn't explain
who killed him.

36:42.424 --> 36:43.459
We're missing something.

36:44.360 --> 36:45.460
The pen.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.394
If Sarah's relationship
with Sam was a fake...

36:47.595 --> 36:50.131
then why did she give him
her grandfather's special pen?

36:50.132 --> 36:51.832
And what was Sarah
really looking for

36:51.932 --> 36:53.198
in Sam's office last night?

36:56.634 --> 36:58.802
Nothing.
This doesn't make any sense.

36:58.903 --> 37:00.104
We went through Sarah's purse.

37:00.105 --> 37:02.005
If there was something in it,
we would've found it.

37:08.042 --> 37:08.976
Castle, what are you doing?

37:09.377 --> 37:10.510
I'm writing a scene.

37:11.511 --> 37:12.878
Let's say Sarah found

37:12.879 --> 37:14.246
what it was she was looking for.

37:15.247 --> 37:16.548
She had it in her hand.

37:17.649 --> 37:19.585
That's when she would've heard
Helen coming out of the house.

37:19.586 --> 37:20.753
She would've had to have

37:20.754 --> 37:24.189
gotten rid of whatever it was
that she found...

37:24.690 --> 37:26.992
Great. You want to write
the part where we find it?

37:27.393 --> 37:28.960
So Helen would never know.

37:33.763 --> 37:35.497
Ah. What do you know?

37:41.370 --> 37:42.704
Power mode is still on.

37:48.575 --> 37:50.173
We're gonna need some tape.

37:50.974 --> 37:52.274
These are the pics
that our vic took

37:52.275 --> 37:53.743
while he was supposedly
at the doctor.

37:54.644 --> 37:56.113
According to
New York Recycle, they ship

37:56.114 --> 37:58.615
their battery sludge up to
the recycling plant in Paramus.

37:58.616 --> 38:00.116
You don't need a boat
to get to Paramus.

38:00.216 --> 38:02.752
Secret method, my ass.
They weren't processing it.

38:02.853 --> 38:04.487
They were switching labels
and dumping it.

38:09.990 --> 38:11.760
That Sam was quite
the Erin Brockovich, wasn't he?

38:12.161 --> 38:14.862
There was no secret
method to battery recycling.

38:15.063 --> 38:17.064
You shipped the sludge out
on cargo barges

38:17.065 --> 38:18.266
and dumped it in the ocean.

38:18.267 --> 38:20.467
The money you saved
on storage and processing

38:20.567 --> 38:22.369
you just put into
your own pocket instead.

38:22.370 --> 38:23.704
Listen, I know my rights.

38:23.905 --> 38:26.240
And I don't
have to say anything.

38:28.541 --> 38:30.343
You sold a bill of goods
to your customers.

38:30.344 --> 38:32.946
You promised them that they
were gonna help save the world.

38:33.647 --> 38:35.515
Instead you poisoned it for money.

38:36.316 --> 38:37.583
What happened, Carlberg?

38:37.884 --> 38:40.053
Sam confront you,
threaten to ruin you?

38:41.054 --> 38:41.955
I didn't kill anyone.

38:42.356 --> 38:43.557
And you...

38:44.358 --> 38:45.159
You have no proof.

38:45.660 --> 38:47.729
Actually, I do.

38:56.171 --> 38:59.473
We ran ballistics.
It's a match.

38:59.874 --> 39:02.043
We found it in the dumpster
outside your apartment building.

39:02.144 --> 39:05.846
Had you recycled, you might
have gotten away with it.

39:06.147 --> 39:08.281
(Mads Langer's "Fact Fiction"
playing)

39:09.882 --> 39:11.150
The night
that your husband was murdered,

39:11.151 --> 39:12.186
He went back to his office

39:12.187 --> 39:14.521
to grab the last few pieces
of evidence he had collected,

39:14.522 --> 39:17.824
and by then, Carlberg had
already become suspicious.

39:17.925 --> 39:19.825
When he realized that your husband

39:19.826 --> 39:22.495
was contacting his old boss for
help in exposing his company,

39:22.496 --> 39:24.397
Carlberg attempted
to buy his silence,

39:24.898 --> 39:26.632
but Sam wouldn't accept the bribe.

39:27.033 --> 39:29.901
Of course not. Not Sam.

39:30.502 --> 39:31.470
You said that the environment

39:31.471 --> 39:33.305
was the most important thing
to your husband.

39:33.306 --> 39:34.341
Well, he died trying to save it,

39:34.342 --> 39:35.709
and we thought
that you should know that.

39:37.210 --> 39:39.945
