at cooking or cleaning.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.663
I'm a modern girl.

17:17.746 --> 17:18.997
I eat convenience food

17:19.080 --> 17:20.999
and do the least amount
of cleaning possible

17:21.083 --> 17:23.585
in order to free up my time
to pursue other stuff.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.672
- What kind of stuff?
- I have my activities.

17:26.755 --> 17:29.216

playing records,

17:29.591 --> 17:30.926
writing poems.

Poems?

17:34.096 --> 17:35.180
What's that?

17:35.597 --> 17:38.225
A poem is like
an odd sort of wish.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.185
Or a child's nursery rhyme.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.437
Sometimes poetry
can make you cry.

17:42.688 --> 17:44.398

17:45.399 --> 17:47.734
it comforts me.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.488

17:51.947 --> 17:53.824
I was abandoned in the park

21:10.354 --> 21:12.814
it will just kill me if you
grow up like the others.

21:15.609 --> 21:17.277
Yes, I promise.

21:19.905 --> 21:21.657
I promise you
I will never grow up.

21:26.745 --> 21:28.497
I think you should kiss me now.

21:30.415 --> 21:31.542
Yeah, sorry.

21:32.251 --> 21:33.252
Forgot about that.

21:51.228 --> 21:52.521
Where are you going?

21:53.814 --> 21:54.815
Peter!

22:24.595 --> 22:26.513
♪ ♪

24:16.415 --> 24:17.541
Would you care for a drink?

24:17.958 --> 24:19.334
No, thanks.

26:39.516 --> 26:41.393
Happy birthday, darling.

26:42.728 --> 26:44.021
Mom?

26:53.947 --> 26:55.073
- Wendy!

26:55.741 --> 26:57.743
Isn't this an
awfully good adventure?

26:58.744 --> 26:59.786
Peter.

27:35.614 --> 27:38.825
- He had promised to
come back for me the next spring.

27:43.622 --> 27:45.123
And so I waited.

27:53.382 --> 27:54.341
And waited.

28:02.850 --> 28:04.226
And waited.

28:15.654 --> 28:18.991
Mostly, I was convinced
that it was my fault.

28:19.324 --> 28:20.784
I had broken my promise.

28:24.872 --> 28:27.249
I was undeniably growing up.

28:29.001 --> 28:32.296
And just like Peter, I was
still missing my mother.

28:51.607 --> 28:52.816
Damn Peter!

31:30.599 --> 31:32.559
Dad?
Why are you crying?

31:32.643 --> 31:34.561
Oh, it's-- it's just--

31:36.313 --> 31:37.314
It's-- it's nothing.

31:39.191 --> 31:40.734
I'm sorry, honey.

31:41.193 --> 31:42.319
Are you okay?

31:42.402 --> 31:43.487
Are you?

31:44.696 --> 31:45.739
Ah...

31:46.448 --> 31:47.866
Yes.

31:47.950 --> 31:49.910
Yeah, I'm okay.

31:58.168 --> 31:59.294
Dad?

31:59.837 --> 32:00.838
Mm-hm?

32:03.006 --> 32:04.883
Do you know where my mom is?

32:10.305 --> 32:11.640
I'm sorry, honey.

32:13.016 --> 32:14.017
I don't.

32:17.980 --> 32:20.065
Is there anything I can do
to make it better for you?

32:20.357 --> 32:21.358
Mm?

32:21.817 --> 32:23.277
What would make you happy?

32:26.530 --> 32:28.323
I want to go visit my Nana.

32:28.532 --> 32:29.700
I miss her.

32:30.117 --> 32:31.076
Hm.

32:33.078 --> 32:34.162
Okay.

32:45.549 --> 32:46.925
Oh, Wendy, darling!

32:48.051 --> 32:50.012
Oh, oh, let me look at you.

32:51.722 --> 32:53.891
Ah! Oh, you look skinny.

32:54.474 --> 32:55.809
I don't feel skinny at all.

32:55.893 --> 32:57.728
How old are you?

32:58.645 --> 33:01.732
I'm 17, but I don't really
like to think

33:01.815 --> 33:03.192
about that kind of thing.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.153
No, you don't, do you?

33:07.654 --> 33:10.991
Darling, tell me exactly

33:11.074 --> 33:13.368
what it is
that's troubling you.

33:13.452 --> 33:16.371
It's Peter!
He's forgotten all about me!

33:16.455 --> 33:18.832
Four years ago,
he promised he'd return for me!

33:18.916 --> 33:21.543
I mean, what could possibly have
come up that was so important,

33:21.627 --> 33:23.170
so completely demanding
of his time,

33:23.253 --> 33:25.255
every minute of every day?

33:27.132 --> 33:28.467
Listen, darling.

33:30.260 --> 33:33.847
I'm here to warn you
about Neverland.

33:35.140 --> 33:39.686
But don't grow angry
and disappear like Jane.

33:40.938 --> 33:43.690
Nana, do you have some
idea of where Jane--

33:44.816 --> 33:46.151
where my mother is?

33:47.319 --> 33:48.403
- Mm.

33:50.322 --> 33:52.324
Lots of ideas.

33:57.120 --> 34:00.749
Listen, darling,
you'll survive this, love.

34:02.209 --> 34:04.002
And don't doubt me,

34:04.545 --> 34:08.465
because your Nana
sees things that you cannot.

34:09.675 --> 34:11.217
What do you see now, Nana?

34:11.760 --> 34:12.844
Well...

34:14.847 --> 34:17.014
I'm too tired.

34:17.349 --> 34:19.141
Please tell me something,

34:19.226 --> 34:20.601
just one thing.

34:20.978 --> 34:22.646
You'll meet a boy...

34:23.813 --> 34:27.150
and he'll love you, dearly.

34:37.911 --> 34:39.036
I'm Adam.

34:39.121 --> 34:40.246
I'm Wendy.

34:41.706 --> 34:43.833
But that won't be
enough for you.

34:44.710 --> 34:45.835
Why not?

34:45.918 --> 34:47.129
Because...

34:49.464 --> 34:51.466
the love of a boy

34:51.550 --> 34:53.927
is not all that a girl needs.

34:59.558 --> 35:00.767
Did you just graduate?

35:00.851 --> 35:03.020
Mm-hm, Masters of Arts.

35:03.103 --> 35:04.354
Congratulations.

35:04.438 --> 35:05.606
Thank you.

35:06.857 --> 35:08.525
And what are you doing here

35:08.609 --> 35:10.068
right after your graduation?

35:10.652 --> 35:12.779
I was just actually...

35:13.322 --> 35:15.616
I was just writing myself
a happy graduation card.

35:16.283 --> 35:17.201
Mm.

35:17.826 --> 35:19.453
I live close by.

35:19.536 --> 35:21.830
I still live with--
with my dad.

35:27.753 --> 35:29.755

I recorded you saying that?

35:36.011 --> 35:37.304
"It's the bugs."

35:37.513 --> 35:38.972

Yeah, just like that.

38:03.450 --> 38:05.369
Why'd you call me Wendy bird?

I dunno.

Like the British
'60s thing, I guess.

38:14.920 --> 38:17.297
Women are birds.
Men are blokes.

38:37.317 --> 38:38.443
Thank you.

38:38.819 --> 38:40.529
I haven't done a thing.

38:41.947 --> 38:43.282
You listened.

38:43.574 --> 38:44.867
You believed.

38:45.868 --> 38:48.537
In fact, you have the look

38:48.620 --> 38:50.038
of a believer.

38:52.207 --> 38:53.792
You don't know the half of it.

39:11.018 --> 39:13.979
- Over time,
my childhood poetry

39:14.062 --> 39:17.524
had given way to tales
of funny little creatures.

39:18.275 --> 39:21.778
But, my melancholy
was as stubborn

39:21.862 --> 39:23.322
as Peter's youth.

39:24.406 --> 39:25.908
-- That's cute.

39:27.367 --> 39:28.702
You scared me!

39:32.748 --> 39:33.832
Where were you?

39:34.124 --> 39:35.417
At the studio.

39:36.126 --> 39:38.170
Working on a piece
I gotta deliver tomorrow.

39:38.837 --> 39:40.506
Still have quite a bit to do,

39:40.589 --> 39:42.591
but it is coming along,
you want to hear?

39:42.925 --> 39:43.926
No.

39:45.802 --> 39:47.846
Why are you in such a good mood?

39:54.811 --> 39:56.772
Why are you always
in such a good mood?

39:57.481 --> 39:58.565
Jealous of my work again?

39:58.649 --> 39:59.775
I'm not jealous.

40:00.817 --> 40:01.818
Come on.

40:01.902 --> 40:03.445
Aren't we starting
to get too old for this?

40:07.616 --> 40:09.326
Oh, thank you.

40:09.409 --> 40:11.912
Thank you very much
for reminding me,

40:11.995 --> 40:14.414
I'm too old for anything!

40:14.498 --> 40:15.666
Hey, hey.

40:20.128 --> 40:22.005
Please don't hurt
the mind I love.

40:27.094 --> 40:29.012
I've been staring
at the screen all day

40:29.096 --> 40:30.472
and nothing came of it.

40:32.808 --> 40:34.101
That's okay.

40:34.726 --> 40:35.727
That can happen.

40:37.271 --> 40:38.522
Can we go for a walk?

Wait, wait, just a sec.

40:56.498 --> 40:57.374
Sweetheart.

41:02.462 --> 41:04.047
Stand for greatness.

41:07.134 --> 41:08.260
Oh, honey.

41:08.760 --> 41:09.803
Is it bad milk?

41:09.887 --> 41:11.054
No.

41:11.597 --> 41:13.807
No, I think I need
to tell you something.

41:15.809 --> 41:16.852
Tell me what?

41:17.019 --> 41:20.105
Well, if you shut off that damn
machine then we can talk.

41:23.442 --> 41:24.568
Okay.

41:25.027 --> 41:26.737
I've been meaning
to tell you--

41:29.406 --> 41:31.116
Okay, when I was little,

41:31.700 --> 41:34.286
my Nana told me I was
going to meet a boy

41:34.369 --> 41:35.245
and I did.

41:35.829 --> 41:37.039
His name is Peter

41:37.122 --> 41:38.749
and he taught me
how to fly

41:39.249 --> 41:41.877
and he took me to a place
where life is never, ever boring

41:41.960 --> 41:44.004
except,
in that same place,

41:44.087 --> 41:46.715
I also met a dark,
horrid figure

41:46.798 --> 41:48.675
who tried to kiss me
against my will

41:48.759 --> 41:51.094
while the flying boy
never even kissed me.

41:51.178 --> 41:53.305
He gave me buttons
and called them kisses.

41:53.597 --> 41:54.973
Isn't that clever?

41:58.894 --> 42:01.939
Wends, you're not making sense.

42:04.191 --> 42:07.945
I feel that my life
is about to be blown up

42:08.028 --> 42:10.072
as if by pirates.

42:20.541 --> 42:21.583
Wendy bird.

42:28.257 --> 42:30.884
- Good God,
we've got a strong girl here.

42:35.722 --> 42:37.599
- A girl who could
serve a higher purpose.

42:38.392 --> 42:40.269
My purpose.

42:40.352 --> 42:41.520
- Wendy bird?

42:41.937 --> 42:42.938
Wendy bird?

42:45.190 --> 42:47.860
Maybe you need someone you
could talk to who could help you

42:47.943 --> 42:50.195
clear up your confusion,
because this is beyond me.

42:51.029 --> 42:52.614
I don't know who
these people are.

42:52.698 --> 42:54.908
The scary man,
the super boy...

42:56.368 --> 42:57.703
Are they real guys?

42:58.495 --> 43:00.789
Or are they characters
in a fable you're working on?

43:16.138 --> 43:17.097
I know you.

43:17.431 --> 43:19.016
Of course you do.

43:19.099 --> 43:20.350
All girls know me.

43:21.852 --> 43:23.061

43:23.145 --> 43:24.688
My darling, I can't.

43:24.771 --> 43:26.398
I really can't.

you want to spend any more time

How dare you?

43:33.614 --> 43:34.573
Shut up.

43:37.201 --> 43:38.619
- I mean, I know...

43:40.245 --> 43:42.331
it was difficult with your
mom being gone.

43:43.707 --> 43:45.792

45:41.200 --> 45:42.159
Really?

45:42.242 --> 45:44.786
Well, just steer clear of
obligations, you know, like...

45:44.870 --> 45:46.371
like husbands.

45:46.455 --> 45:50.459
Dad, I'm pregnant
and I'm about to get married.

45:50.542 --> 45:52.461
I didn't exactly plan this
but here we are--

45:52.544 --> 45:53.754
Of course.

45:54.254 --> 45:55.547
Of course.

45:55.839 --> 45:57.090
I love you, Dad.

46:00.177 --> 46:01.386
I love you, too.

46:11.813 --> 46:13.565
Time to fly away, ladybird.

46:31.416 --> 46:32.417
- Good evening.

46:32.835 --> 46:34.962
Welcome to this important moment

46:35.045 --> 46:37.005
in the lives
of this couple.

46:37.089 --> 46:39.341
We invite you to leave behind

46:39.424 --> 46:41.844
the worries and concerns
of everyday life

46:41.927 --> 46:44.638
and join us in the celebration
of marriage.

46:44.888 --> 46:47.808
Adam Ullman,
do you take this woman,

46:47.891 --> 46:50.227
Wendy Margaret
Darling Braverman,

46:50.310 --> 46:51.770
to be your wife?

46:52.145 --> 46:55.107
Do you pledge to share
your life openly with her

46:55.190 --> 46:58.110
and to speak the truth
to her in love?

46:59.653 --> 47:01.154
- I do.

47:04.825 --> 47:07.286
- Wendy Margaret Darling
Braverman,

47:07.870 --> 47:10.664
do you take this man,
Adam Ullman,

47:10.747 --> 47:12.291
to be your husband?

47:12.374 --> 47:14.251
Do you pledge
to share your life

47:14.334 --> 47:18.005
openly with him and to speak
the truth to him in love?

47:37.774 --> 47:39.234
Did she say yes?

47:39.318 --> 47:40.611
Not yet, no.

47:48.160 --> 47:50.204
Yes.
Yes, I do.

47:52.164 --> 47:54.416
- Good.
It is my pleasure to now

47:54.499 --> 47:56.835
pronounce you husband and wife.

48:08.555 --> 48:10.599
You may now kiss the bride.

48:38.460 --> 48:40.629
Why are you staring at me like
you've seen a ghost?

48:40.712 --> 48:42.840
Because I have seen a ghost.

48:43.006 --> 48:44.383
You're ever the ghost, Peter.

48:45.926 --> 48:47.135
All this--

48:48.595 --> 48:50.973
This is one big
ghost story

48:51.056 --> 48:53.600
compared to the rock-solid
story I live in.

48:54.393 --> 48:56.019
What's the matter,
little lady?

48:57.062 --> 48:58.647
Is it because
you're a little fat?

48:58.730 --> 48:59.940
And a lot taller?

49:00.315 --> 49:05.112
Well, I could've stayed
with you and the Lost Boys

49:05.696 --> 49:09.241
and I would have had
a pretty interesting life

49:09.324 --> 49:11.034
as some sort of mother.

49:13.579 --> 49:16.081
But I don't even know that
I want to be a mother.

49:20.669 --> 49:23.380
Peter, is my mother, Jane,
is she on the island?

49:25.257 --> 49:26.383
Jane.

49:33.891 --> 49:35.851
I haven't seen the bird in ages.

49:36.768 --> 49:38.270
What was she like?

49:38.562 --> 49:39.813
Was she anything like me?

49:39.980 --> 49:42.441
Yeah.
Kind of like you.

49:44.484 --> 49:45.777
But even taller.

49:46.820 --> 49:47.821
And skinnier.

49:48.363 --> 49:49.781
I meant her personality.

49:49.865 --> 49:50.949
Oh, well...

50:02.169 --> 50:03.921
- What's strange is
that on the inside,

50:04.630 --> 50:08.342
Jane was exactly like me.

50:09.801 --> 50:11.845
You know, the girl fancied me.

50:12.346 --> 50:14.765
So I tried to
indulge her needs, but...

50:16.475 --> 50:17.684
it was a nightmare.

50:21.897 --> 50:23.190
What happened?

50:23.649 --> 50:24.733
Baby?

50:24.942 --> 50:27.903
Peter, so much is happening,

50:27.986 --> 50:29.655
I don't even know
where to begin.

50:30.989 --> 50:32.783
For one thing,
I'm married.

50:34.701 --> 50:35.994
You're married?

50:37.829 --> 50:38.789
You promised.

50:40.332 --> 50:41.792
You promised me, Wendy.

50:57.683 --> 50:59.935
Listen, there was
no good way to tell you.

51:00.352 --> 51:03.146
I mean, you never showed me
the slightest interest.

51:03.230 --> 51:04.606
I'm showing you something now.

51:05.524 --> 51:07.401
I've brought you all
the kisses I've collected

51:07.484 --> 51:09.069
over the last couple of days.

51:10.112 --> 51:12.281
♪ ♪

51:32.634 --> 51:34.136
Peter!

51:41.602 --> 51:44.438
Sorry, your little
friend's not here.

51:45.522 --> 51:46.607
Just me.

51:49.234 --> 51:50.611
You ended up with me.

51:52.154 --> 51:54.198
I wonder if that's ever
going to be enough for you.

52:06.668 --> 52:09.296
- And then
my daughter came along.

52:09.379 --> 52:10.506
Berry.

52:11.548 --> 52:13.509
I thought she'd be
the perfect little person

52:13.592 --> 52:15.302
to share my stories with.

52:17.262 --> 52:18.388
Thank you, Dad.

52:18.722 --> 52:19.681
They're beautiful.

52:19.765 --> 52:22.017
- No, you are.

52:22.851 --> 52:25.604
Hey! Look at my gorgeous
princess!

52:25.687 --> 52:26.605
Come here!

52:29.107 --> 52:30.817
Look at how tall you got.

52:30.901 --> 52:32.694
Well, that was delicious.

52:33.320 --> 52:34.321
Thank you.

52:36.532 --> 52:39.117
Gosh.
The more I look at you...

52:39.993 --> 52:40.994
It's incredible.

52:41.078 --> 52:42.621
There's something about her.

52:42.704 --> 52:44.790
She reminds me of Jane,
more than you ever did.

52:45.207 --> 52:46.250
Who's Jane?

52:46.542 --> 52:48.669
We actually don't know
who she is,

52:48.752 --> 52:50.963
so I don't understand why
you had to bring this up.

52:54.299 --> 52:56.426
-- I've got it.
- No, I can do it.

52:59.680 --> 53:00.722
- Do you want to see it?

53:00.806 --> 53:02.391
Of course I want to see it!

53:02.474 --> 53:05.894
The first copy arrived today,
I am so relieved.

53:05.978 --> 53:09.481
It took so long and with
Berry here, it was difficult.

53:10.148 --> 53:12.317
Thank God you're going
to school now.

53:12.776 --> 53:13.819
Hm.

53:14.027 --> 53:16.071
Mommy never wants me around.

53:16.697 --> 53:18.949
Honey, it's just
that you have to understand,

53:19.032 --> 53:21.952
not all kids get to have their
moms around all the time.

53:23.662 --> 53:26.123
Berry, would you please
go and pick up Mom's book

53:26.206 --> 53:28.250
so that we can show it
to Grandpa?

53:31.545 --> 53:33.755
Berry, go, go on! Go, shoo!

53:38.093 --> 53:42.055
Adam wrote a sort of symphony
in his spare time.

53:42.514 --> 53:43.515
Wow.

53:51.231 --> 53:52.149
My book!

53:53.984 --> 53:55.569
- My book!
- Why did you do that?

53:55.986 --> 53:57.654
My book!

53:58.989 --> 54:00.199
My book!

54:00.782 --> 54:03.619
My book! My book! My book!

54:04.077 --> 54:05.329
My book!

54:05.871 --> 54:07.164
Honey, calm down!

54:07.247 --> 54:08.290
It's just one copy!

54:08.373 --> 54:09.833
- Of course
you were gonna say that.

54:10.250 --> 54:12.377
This is my first
published book!

54:12.461 --> 54:14.046
And it took me
forever to write it

54:14.129 --> 54:16.340
because I had to be
looking after her

54:16.423 --> 54:18.175
while you were out making music,

54:18.258 --> 54:20.594
so now, you put her to sleep

54:20.677 --> 54:22.137
and I'm gonna go out
for a drink!

54:22.221 --> 54:23.931
- Wendy, wait a minute...
- Let me go.

54:25.641 --> 54:26.600
- Are you okay?

54:43.450 --> 54:45.035
Would you care for a drink?

56:19.755 --> 56:20.714
Mom?

56:20.923 --> 56:22.174
Yes?

56:22.674 --> 56:23.884
You stink.

56:26.386 --> 56:28.889
And you smell like a peach.

56:31.934 --> 56:33.727
A real peach.

56:41.318 --> 56:44.571
Mom? Why are you looking
at a cats video?

56:44.738 --> 56:48.283
Oh, it's supposed to calm
the nervous system.

56:49.535 --> 56:50.702
It's not working, though.

56:52.412 --> 56:54.498
Wait! Come here.

56:54.748 --> 56:57.125
It would be very good for
your mother to talk to you

56:57.209 --> 56:58.585
before she reads in
public tonight.

57:00.504 --> 57:01.421
Please.

57:03.173 --> 57:04.466
You don't need to read to me,

57:04.550 --> 57:05.926
because I'm never
going to like it.

57:06.009 --> 57:08.595
Never?
You mean really never?

57:08.971 --> 57:10.138
Yep.

57:10.430 --> 57:11.849
Well, I don't know.

57:11.932 --> 57:15.894
Someday maybe you'll be
curious about my stories.

57:16.520 --> 57:17.604
Never.

57:20.023 --> 57:23.026
Never sounds like
an awfully long time.

58:01.940 --> 58:03.650
Okay, people.

58:04.359 --> 58:05.944
Okay, let's get down
to business.

58:06.653 --> 58:07.571
Hey.

58:09.114 --> 58:11.992
It gives me
great pleasure to introduce

58:12.075 --> 58:14.828
this evening's author.

58:16.205 --> 58:20.083
She has created a collection
of contemporary fables

58:20.167 --> 58:22.294
that is... truly divine.

58:22.377 --> 58:24.004
"Ferrets Are Free,"

58:24.087 --> 58:26.798
"The World According
to Chloe the Cat,"

58:26.882 --> 58:29.176
"Weasels Are Doing It
For Themselves"

58:29.259 --> 58:32.095
is a divination
of the truth

58:32.179 --> 58:35.891
in a way that we have become
unaccustomed to hearing.

58:36.350 --> 58:40.896
So, please give a warm
welcome to our house

58:40.979 --> 58:43.774
to the charming
Wendy Darling.

58:50.364 --> 58:52.115
Thank you-- Sorry.

58:55.410 --> 58:57.996
"Weasels Are Doing It
For Themselves."

58:59.248 --> 59:01.625
A silly title to be sure but,

59:01.708 --> 59:04.545
one that
both empowers

59:04.628 --> 59:07.422
and makes
fun of empowerment.

59:07.506 --> 59:10.509
My idea here is
to make fun of empowerment

59:10.592 --> 59:14.221
because what kind
of a world is this,

59:14.304 --> 59:17.432
where we're not
naturally empowered,

59:17.808 --> 59:20.018
where we have
to grab for power.

59:20.811 --> 59:23.689
Besides things you
have to grab for

59:23.772 --> 59:25.816
are always quite elusive.

59:27.860 --> 59:30.863
So, I asked myself,

59:30.946 --> 59:33.282
what is the
nature of the weasel?

59:33.365 --> 59:36.118
Mania, enthusiasm,

59:36.827 --> 59:37.828
eccentricity.

59:43.750 --> 59:45.502
♪ ♪

1:00:05.856 --> 1:00:07.482
- Dinner's ready.
- Thanks, Dad.

1:00:08.275 --> 1:00:09.943
My mother works for Greenpeace.

1:00:10.110 --> 1:00:12.237
So she's always
on some boat somewhere.

1:00:12.738 --> 1:00:15.616
Ms. Darling, I really
enjoyed reading your book.

1:00:16.033 --> 1:00:18.035
Could I please have some more
mashed potatoes?

1:00:18.118 --> 1:00:19.494
Oh, sure. Which one?

1:00:20.204 --> 1:00:21.580
- Um, "Bunny's Blue."

1:00:22.331 --> 1:00:24.708
You don't have to be a waif
to have a dark soul.

1:00:25.125 --> 1:00:27.044
Thank you so much.

1:00:27.127 --> 1:00:28.337
Would you like a copy?

1:00:28.504 --> 1:00:29.588
Let me get it for you.

Is she really gonna make
this all about her books?

1:00:33.467 --> 1:00:35.385
Berry, he just asked
to see "Bunny's Blue."

1:00:35.469 --> 1:00:36.637
No, he didn't.

1:00:36.762 --> 1:00:38.847
I'm sorry, I'll get it
for you later.

1:00:40.349 --> 1:00:43.227
Berry's never really
liked my stories very much.

1:00:43.727 --> 1:00:45.062
That's right, I don't.

1:00:45.729 --> 1:00:48.482
I mean, let's face it. They're
all just some kind of variation

1:00:48.565 --> 1:00:51.026
of the great adventure you
had as a child in Neverland.

1:00:51.735 --> 1:00:53.487
Why are you talking
about Neverland?

1:00:53.570 --> 1:00:54.738
Exactly.

1:00:55.447 --> 1:00:56.532
It's just a bunch of bullshit.

1:00:58.242 --> 1:00:59.493
And what makes you say that?

1:00:59.743 --> 1:01:00.953
- Because it is.

1:01:01.203 --> 1:01:03.705
I mean, come on,
let's get serious.

1:01:04.248 --> 1:01:06.500
Your mother,
Jane, went missing years ago

1:01:06.583 --> 1:01:08.043
and Great Nana has been
in and out

1:01:08.126 --> 1:01:10.420
of mental institutions
ever since

1:01:10.504 --> 1:01:12.381
and we're all only still
talking about

1:01:12.464 --> 1:01:14.049
a mythical place
like Neverland

1:01:14.132 --> 1:01:15.634
as if it was ever even real?

1:01:15.717 --> 1:01:17.845
Because no one can
tell the truth about Jane.

1:01:18.053 --> 1:01:19.346
I am serious.

1:01:20.013 --> 1:01:21.682
And you're denigrating us.

1:01:21.765 --> 1:01:23.350
You're making a mockery of us.

1:01:23.851 --> 1:01:25.936
So you're saying I have to
believe in a crock of shit

1:01:26.019 --> 1:01:27.855
so you'll love me?
Is that what you're saying?

1:01:27.938 --> 1:01:30.524
Yes! You have to believe
in a crock of shit!

1:01:30.858 --> 1:01:32.568
Well, I don't!

1:01:34.236 --> 1:01:35.404
Sayonara, Mama.

1:01:37.322 --> 1:01:38.323
Let's go.

1:01:46.874 --> 1:01:48.750
Thank you for the lovely dinner.

1:01:59.678 --> 1:02:01.847
Of course it's going
to be my fault.

1:02:01.930 --> 1:02:03.432
I'm not saying that.

1:02:03.849 --> 1:02:05.184
Just think
you guys need to spend

1:02:05.267 --> 1:02:06.602
some quality
mother-daughter time.

1:02:07.978 --> 1:02:09.021
What's that?

1:02:10.355 --> 1:02:11.440
Have some fun together.

1:02:11.523 --> 1:02:12.649
I don't know how to do that.

1:02:12.733 --> 1:02:14.026
I'm just no fun.

1:02:17.529 --> 1:02:21.158
Hey. I think you're a barrel
full of monkeys.

1:02:22.075 --> 1:02:23.493
Or is it a bowlful of jelly?

1:02:28.790 --> 1:02:31.168
How about a visit to Great Nana?

1:02:32.836 --> 1:02:33.837
Yeah.

1:02:34.338 --> 1:02:35.339
Yeah?

1:02:35.422 --> 1:02:36.632
I'd like that.

1:02:45.057 --> 1:02:48.227
- It barely occurred
to me that Berry's venting

1:02:48.477 --> 1:02:51.063
could have been
the culmination of generations

1:02:51.146 --> 1:02:54.191
of repressed anger that
had never been sorted out

1:02:54.274 --> 1:02:55.901
from mother to daughter.

1:02:56.360 --> 1:02:57.277
Oh, my God.

1:02:59.029 --> 1:03:01.907
I am so excited
we're going to Granny's.

1:03:01.990 --> 1:03:04.284
Why don't you start
talking like an adult?

1:03:04.368 --> 1:03:05.619
Or just don't
talk at all.

1:03:16.839 --> 1:03:18.298
- Oh!
- Nana!

1:03:24.346 --> 1:03:26.056
Nana, what's up
with the windows?

1:03:27.933 --> 1:03:29.977
Oh, that's an experiment.

1:03:30.060 --> 1:03:32.396
Professor Smithson wants to see

1:03:32.479 --> 1:03:35.566
if I can imagine flying
instead of jumping.

1:03:35.649 --> 1:03:38.110
- You're dressed like Peter.

1:03:43.073 --> 1:03:44.241
Berry.

1:03:45.576 --> 1:03:46.702
Great Nana.

1:03:49.162 --> 1:03:50.539
Oh, sweetheart.

1:03:50.622 --> 1:03:51.790
Oh...

1:03:52.416 --> 1:03:54.501
You're damaging the merchandise.

1:03:55.210 --> 1:03:59.339
I mean, the merchandise is
already a bit crushed, but...

1:04:06.054 --> 1:04:07.097
- Ah...

1:04:11.643 --> 1:04:12.853
I'm flummoxed.

1:04:13.645 --> 1:04:15.063
That we're here together?

1:04:15.147 --> 1:04:16.148
Oh no, no, no, no.

1:04:17.482 --> 1:04:21.403
Because Jane, your mother,
isn't here with us.

1:04:21.778 --> 1:04:23.322
Where is she?

1:04:23.405 --> 1:04:27.534
She insists on living,
oh, so far away.

1:04:27.618 --> 1:04:30.245
It's not considerate,
is it, Berry?

1:04:30.329 --> 1:04:31.496
I guess not.

1:04:32.497 --> 1:04:33.540
- Mm.

1:04:35.083 --> 1:04:38.086
So, get me my handbag.

1:04:39.338 --> 1:04:41.298
- Sorry?
- Get my handbag.

1:04:43.717 --> 1:04:45.260
We're getting out of here.

1:04:45.344 --> 1:04:46.845
Is it wise?

1:04:47.179 --> 1:04:49.681
I mean, you--
you seem a little tired.

1:04:49.765 --> 1:04:51.016
Don't ruin things, Mama.

1:04:51.975 --> 1:04:54.520
She just wants to go out
on the town, right?

1:04:54.811 --> 1:04:55.896
Right.

1:05:05.948 --> 1:05:09.826
♪ She stepped away from me ♪

1:05:10.369 --> 1:05:13.413
♪ As she moved
through the fair ♪

1:05:13.497 --> 1:05:16.291
♪ And I watched her fondly ♪

1:05:16.458 --> 1:05:19.920
♪ Move here and move there ♪

1:05:20.379 --> 1:05:23.131
♪ And she went homeward ♪

1:05:25.175 --> 1:05:28.345
♪ With one star awake ♪

1:05:29.012 --> 1:05:33.183
♪ As the swans in the evening ♪

1:05:33.642 --> 1:05:36.061
♪ Move over the lake ♪

1:05:36.144 --> 1:05:39.481
And then he flew us
all away to Neverland.

1:05:40.065 --> 1:05:42.985
And the fairies
and the pirates

1:05:43.068 --> 1:05:46.405
and the Indians
and the Mermaids Lagoon

1:05:46.655 --> 1:05:48.073
and the Lost Boys

1:05:48.448 --> 1:05:50.367
and the home underground

1:05:51.326 --> 1:05:52.661
the little house.

1:06:01.044 --> 1:06:02.838
Mom, she's doing
her mysterious thing again.

1:06:04.214 --> 1:06:07.718
What's wrong
with being mysterious?

1:06:08.802 --> 1:06:10.345
- I don't know,
it's just...

1:06:10.721 --> 1:06:13.599
I guess I feel like mystery
and fantasy take people away.

1:06:14.349 --> 1:06:16.351
It's like no one
is ever really present

1:06:16.435 --> 1:06:17.936
in this family for very long.

1:06:18.854 --> 1:06:20.022
People go off.

1:06:21.648 --> 1:06:23.734
People always find
something better to do.

1:06:24.401 --> 1:06:25.444
- Oh, Wendy.

1:06:26.111 --> 1:06:31.116
We've all of us swept too many
things under the carpet.

1:06:31.200 --> 1:06:33.076
Me? I'm not--

1:06:33.577 --> 1:06:35.621
I'm not sweeping
anything under.

1:06:36.079 --> 1:06:37.706
I doubt that.

1:06:39.499 --> 1:06:42.711
Berry, when you think people
are going away,

1:06:43.587 --> 1:06:45.839
going to visit
their memories.

1:06:46.381 --> 1:06:49.051
At thirteen, you haven't
many memories to visit.

1:06:49.718 --> 1:06:53.597
You have a lifetime
of memories to make.

1:06:55.474 --> 1:06:58.936
Wendy darling, would you mind
leaving us alone for a moment?

1:06:59.478 --> 1:07:01.355
No. Why?

1:07:02.064 --> 1:07:04.858
Peter's coming
for Berry anytime now.

1:07:05.275 --> 1:07:08.195
I actually don't believe
he'll be coming for Berry.

1:07:08.278 --> 1:07:09.446
You don't believe?

1:07:09.655 --> 1:07:11.281
It's not that I don't believe.

1:07:11.365 --> 1:07:12.741
It's just that...

1:07:13.408 --> 1:07:15.661
I don't think I want that.

1:07:17.538 --> 1:07:19.706
But it doesn't matter
what you want.

1:07:27.339 --> 1:07:29.466
I'm going to go hunt
for some chocolate.

1:07:33.720 --> 1:07:38.141
You will wake up
one starry night...

1:07:40.978 --> 1:07:45.232
And you will find a kid
squatting on the floor.

1:07:45.524 --> 1:07:48.819
Bawling his head off,
crying his eyes out.

1:08:18.557 --> 1:08:20.350
Well if it isn't
the boy wonder.

1:08:22.935 --> 1:08:23.979
I don't get it.

1:08:25.314 --> 1:08:26.314
Like...

1:08:27.024 --> 1:08:28.108
why aren't you crying?

1:08:29.902 --> 1:08:32.904
Oh, I just don't really
feel like it right now.

1:08:33.738 --> 1:08:34.656
Oh, yeah?

1:08:34.865 --> 1:08:35.991
Yeah.

1:08:48.337 --> 1:08:50.964
"This is the moment
where you say to yourself,

1:08:51.048 --> 1:08:52.758
"the little voice was right

1:08:53.050 --> 1:08:54.676
"I don't get to have this,

1:08:54.801 --> 1:08:57.386
I don't get to be like
other people."

1:08:58.095 --> 1:08:59.139
Girl, you
need to lighten up.

1:08:59.223 --> 1:09:00.182
Give it back!

1:09:00.265 --> 1:09:01.683
What's so special
about her anyway?

1:09:01.767 --> 1:09:03.185
She has amazing super powers.

1:09:03.894 --> 1:09:06.772
In fact, she's just about the
coolest superhero of all time.

1:09:07.731 --> 1:09:10.567
I'm sorry, love,
but you're so wrong.

1:09:10.943 --> 1:09:12.819
- There are no superheroes.

1:09:13.153 --> 1:09:14.988
There's just me. Pan.

1:09:16.073 --> 1:09:18.742
I am the hero of every story.

1:09:21.245 --> 1:09:22.371
Hey, give it back, asshole.

1:09:23.663 --> 1:09:24.540
Give it--

1:09:29.502 --> 1:09:31.380
Excuse me,
but I've come a long way.

1:09:31.462 --> 1:09:32.506
I know.

1:09:34.716 --> 1:09:37.135
I am more ready to leave this
world than you can imagine.

1:09:47.688 --> 1:09:48.689
There.

1:09:49.857 --> 1:09:50.941
Let's go.

1:09:51.567 --> 1:09:53.193
Are you not
in the least bit afraid?

1:09:53.777 --> 1:09:55.070
- No.

1:09:57.489 --> 1:09:59.491
And even in
the worst case scenario,

1:10:01.743 --> 1:10:05.289
to die will be an
awfully big adventure.

1:10:10.085 --> 1:10:11.044
All right.

1:10:13.338 --> 1:10:14.464
Can we go now?

1:10:15.257 --> 1:10:17.050
We'll be off in a sec, just--

1:10:17.134 --> 1:10:18.468
just tell me one thing.

1:10:18.552 --> 1:10:19.720
Yeah, I know stories.

1:10:20.429 --> 1:10:21.722
Okay, sunshine.

1:10:22.764 --> 1:10:24.099
I believe you know
the drill.

1:10:24.183 --> 1:10:25.350
Sure, flyboy.

1:10:25.434 --> 1:10:27.644
The happy thoughts
meditation thing?

1:10:27.728 --> 1:10:30.355
Right, right. But Wendy,
it's got to be true.

1:10:30.439 --> 1:10:33.317
Berry! My name is Berry.

1:10:33.609 --> 1:10:34.985
You know, like a berry.

1:10:35.068 --> 1:10:36.737
No, I know, I know,
I was just--

1:10:36.820 --> 1:10:38.447
I was just thinking
of Wendy's stories.

1:10:39.781 --> 1:10:40.949
They're amazing.

1:10:41.033 --> 1:10:42.993
Wendy's stories have
the most horrid endings.

1:10:43.452 --> 1:10:45.078
They either end badly

1:10:45.245 --> 1:10:46.663
or they end just like that!

1:10:50.083 --> 1:10:52.961
She actually ran out of stories
by the time I was born.

1:10:53.629 --> 1:10:55.088
Is that why you don't rate her?

1:10:56.089 --> 1:10:57.549
Yeah, but...

1:10:59.885 --> 1:11:01.512
really,
you're the problem.

1:11:02.679 --> 1:11:04.556
What have I got to do
with anything?

1:11:04.973 --> 1:11:07.976
You have everything
to do with everything.

1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:10.896
You practically run
this family.

1:11:13.190 --> 1:11:14.816
She doesn't really
want to be here anymore

1:11:14.900 --> 1:11:16.902
because she got so screwed up
by you when she was little.

1:11:18.612 --> 1:11:19.821
And guess what?

1:11:22.241 --> 1:11:23.242
At this point,

1:11:24.910 --> 1:11:26.745
I don't really want
to be here either.

1:11:51.019 --> 1:11:52.229
Berry!

1:11:53.438 --> 1:11:56.066
Berry! Berry, wake up!

1:11:56.149 --> 1:11:58.235
Berry! Berry!

1:12:01.655 --> 1:12:02.906
It's Pan.

1:12:02.990 --> 1:12:03.949
What's Pan?

1:12:04.032 --> 1:12:06.201
This.
This accident.

1:12:06.618 --> 1:12:08.078
- We don't know
what this is.

1:12:08.245 --> 1:12:10.205
Looks like a seizure.
Or an overdose, or...

1:13:09.681 --> 1:13:12.059
Had Berry flown and fallen?

1:13:12.309 --> 1:13:14.561
Had she never gotten
off the ground?

1:13:15.270 --> 1:13:17.356
I was determined to
discover what had happened

1:13:17.439 --> 1:13:19.441
between my daughter and Peter.

1:13:19.816 --> 1:13:22.611
Except I was still
trying to determine

1:13:22.694 --> 1:13:25.280
what had happened
between Peter and me.

1:13:34.248 --> 1:13:38.418
So fabulous to see you again
and in such a good mood.

1:13:38.502 --> 1:13:40.462
Now, where were we?

1:13:40.546 --> 1:13:42.756
Oh yes, the part
where I abduct you.

1:13:58.397 --> 1:14:00.023
-- Hey.
- Hi.

1:14:00.107 --> 1:14:02.901
I'm in trouble,
Hook is here.

1:14:02.985 --> 1:14:04.653
At least I think he's here.

1:14:05.112 --> 1:14:06.780
I need you, please hurry.

1:14:06.864 --> 1:14:08.907
Wends, I can't deal
with this right now.

1:14:08.991 --> 1:14:10.158
Oh, well, then tell me

1:14:10.242 --> 1:14:11.451
the right time,
so I can be there.

1:14:11.535 --> 1:14:12.578
- Wendy, please.

1:14:12.661 --> 1:14:14.580
I am really trying
to keep this family together.

1:14:14.663 --> 1:14:15.747
What are you
trying to do?

1:14:15.831 --> 1:14:16.915
I'm trying too!

1:14:16.999 --> 1:14:18.208
Well, then try harder

1:14:18.292 --> 1:14:20.085
not to make up your mind
about what's happening.

1:14:20.169 --> 1:14:21.503
What's happening!

1:14:21.587 --> 1:14:23.130
Hey, that sounds cool,
doesn't it?

1:14:23.213 --> 1:14:25.340
Like, man,
what's happening?

1:14:25.424 --> 1:14:26.508
- Wendy.

1:14:27.259 --> 1:14:28.844
Berry and I
need you to be strong.

1:14:28.927 --> 1:14:30.220
Well, sorry to disappoint.

1:14:31.013 --> 1:14:33.223
Sorry that I'm just not...

1:14:33.307 --> 1:14:34.516
- Stop this, Wendy!

1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:35.601
It's time to get real!

1:14:35.684 --> 1:14:37.019
- Good one.

1:14:37.102 --> 1:14:38.812
It appears that's
just not in the cards.

1:14:38.896 --> 1:14:41.231
Wendy!
I can't stand it anymore!

1:14:41.315 --> 1:14:42.774
I can't stand the anger,

1:14:42.858 --> 1:14:44.026
the ghosts, the craziness...

1:14:44.109 --> 1:14:46.028
And so you won't have to.

1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:01.043
- What's that?

1:15:04.213 --> 1:15:05.547
Nothing to say?

1:15:05.631 --> 1:15:07.049
I'm crushed.

1:15:07.132 --> 1:15:09.635
I honestly expect more
from a Darling.

1:15:10.677 --> 1:15:13.013
Oh, do I really have
to skip a generation?

1:15:13.096 --> 1:15:14.473
Move on to your daughter?

1:15:14.973 --> 1:15:16.475
No, stay away from her!

1:15:16.558 --> 1:15:18.685
That's better.

1:15:19.061 --> 1:15:22.147
Now, perhaps you are
Jane's daughter after all.

1:15:22.231 --> 1:15:24.816
Jane? What do you know
about Jane?

1:15:24.900 --> 1:15:27.236
What don't I know about Jane?

1:15:28.654 --> 1:15:29.780
Is she alive?

1:15:29.863 --> 1:15:32.491
That depends on your
definition of alive.

1:15:32.574 --> 1:15:33.909
Where is she?

1:15:34.326 --> 1:15:35.327
Give me something.

1:15:35.744 --> 1:15:38.622
Well, here's a little something.

1:15:41.917 --> 1:15:43.418
There.
What does that mean?

1:15:45.546 --> 1:15:46.797
Disaster.

1:15:48.674 --> 1:15:50.843
Absolute doom and defeat.

1:16:25.127 --> 1:16:26.336
Would you like to come in?

1:16:28.589 --> 1:16:29.590
Would I.

1:16:30.215 --> 1:16:32.050
Did I forget something crucial?

1:16:32.384 --> 1:16:34.094
A password? A rhyme?

1:16:34.428 --> 1:16:35.888
No, no, um...

1:16:38.307 --> 1:16:39.558
Well, there's history.

1:16:43.270 --> 1:16:44.396
Mm...

1:16:44.479 --> 1:16:45.981
There's history all right.

1:16:49.026 --> 1:16:51.320
What makes you think
I won't call the police?

"What makes you think
I won't call the police?"

1:16:54.364 --> 1:16:57.409
Just maybe because I have
your daughter in my grip.

1:16:57.492 --> 1:17:00.412
You are mistaken.
She's nowhere near you.

1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:13.842
Not another word
till we get to the ship.

1:17:47.292 --> 1:17:48.293
You're coming in.

1:19:02.993 --> 1:19:04.203
It's K-Rap.

1:19:04.411 --> 1:19:05.829
We play rap music.

1:19:06.121 --> 1:19:08.957
This is a radio station?

1:19:09.041 --> 1:19:11.460
Yes ma'am. Pirate radio.

1:19:22.804 --> 1:19:23.931
See?

1:19:25.974 --> 1:19:27.392
I'm not such a baddy.

1:19:29.144 --> 1:19:30.437
I'm a fun guy.

1:19:31.063 --> 1:19:32.606
A regular Joe.

1:19:33.565 --> 1:19:34.650
Hardly.

1:19:34.733 --> 1:19:36.360
There's a bit of Pan in Hook
and Hook in Pan.

1:19:36.443 --> 1:19:37.528
Or hadn't you noticed?

1:19:37.861 --> 1:19:39.446
What am I doing here?

1:19:39.571 --> 1:19:40.864
You'll love it here.

1:19:40.948 --> 1:19:42.366
Away from the mainland

1:19:42.449 --> 1:19:45.160
and all those boring,
mundane concerns.

1:19:45.244 --> 1:19:46.745
You've taken me
aboard this ship.

1:19:46.828 --> 1:19:48.747
I don't see you resisting me.

1:19:48.830 --> 1:19:50.624
You're as free as a bird.

1:19:51.458 --> 1:19:52.584
Why are you here?

1:19:52.668 --> 1:19:53.627
Me?

1:19:53.919 --> 1:19:55.420
I got picked up by the wind.

1:19:56.296 --> 1:19:58.590

Misused.

Neverland gives us
the gift of true freedom.

1:20:13.188 --> 1:20:14.773
But what good is being free

1:20:14.857 --> 1:20:16.817

found by love?

but without the dust,
I've got to try it his way.

1:25:02.519 --> 1:25:03.645
For a moment,

1:27:38.550 --> 1:27:39.885
As we all know,

1:27:39.968 --> 1:27:43.347
my grandmother's heart
and mind were vast,

1:27:43.889 --> 1:27:46.934
open to entertaining
more than one world

1:27:47.768 --> 1:27:51.396
and she somehow passed
that ability on to her lineage.

1:27:53.857 --> 1:27:55.484
And to this day

1:27:55.609 --> 1:27:58.820
I can't really tell you
that I'm sure what we've seen,

1:27:59.154 --> 1:28:01.281
what we've
experienced,

1:28:01.740 --> 1:28:03.951

So what if we're
a little unstable?

1:28:12.835 --> 1:28:14.628
My Nana told me,

1:28:15.254 --> 1:28:18.298
"Never be jealous
of the stable ones,

1:28:20.050 --> 1:28:21.927

You and Great Nana,

1:28:51.999 --> 1:28:54.084
you shared something
totally cool.

1:28:54.168 --> 1:28:55.711

Ah...

1:30:55.873 --> 1:30:56.915
Well...

1:30:58.208 --> 1:30:59.293

1:31:01.336 --> 1:31:02.254

1:31:08.802 --> 1:31:09.803

1:31:09.887 --> 1:31:11.597
You better tell me about you.

1:31:13.098 --> 1:31:15.767
I see.
Um, that's fair enough.

1:31:17.269 --> 1:31:19.605
Well, I suppose
your father told you

1:31:19.688 --> 1:31:21.023
horrible things about me.

1:31:21.940 --> 1:31:24.276

abandoned you.

1:31:25.027 --> 1:31:26.904
You did abandon me.

1:31:29.531 --> 1:31:34.286

said anything about you at all.

1:31:36.038 --> 1:31:37.664
Every little detail about you,

1:31:37.748 --> 1:31:39.499
I had to make it all up
myself.

1:31:41.960 --> 1:31:43.504
I am the villain.

1:31:44.338 --> 1:31:45.839
No, you're like a ghost.

1:31:47.216 --> 1:31:48.842
Would you like to leave it
that way?

1:31:49.092 --> 1:31:50.260
No.

1:31:50.761 --> 1:31:52.137
Please...

1:31:52.221 --> 1:31:53.180

1:31:53.263 --> 1:31:54.723
I deserve to hear it.

1:32:02.689 --> 1:32:04.274

1:32:04.650 --> 1:32:05.734
Oh, Wendy.

1:32:10.447 --> 1:32:11.657
The truth.

1:32:12.199 --> 1:32:13.617
The kind that's true.

1:32:16.328 --> 1:32:17.454
The truth.

1:32:21.500 --> 1:32:22.459
Mom.

1:32:25.170 --> 1:32:26.421
Are you okay?

1:32:27.256 --> 1:32:29.675
Yes, it-- it's just--

1:32:30.300 --> 1:32:32.678
even now I don't know
what the truth is.

1:32:33.637 --> 1:32:36.181
See, I-- I grew up
with the feeling that...

1:32:37.057 --> 1:32:39.852
reality could fail me
at any time.

1:32:39.935 --> 1:32:41.270
So did I.

1:32:42.145 --> 1:32:43.981
I didn't want that for you.

1:32:44.481 --> 1:32:46.692
I didn't want you
to have to endure that.

1:32:47.317 --> 1:32:48.986
I did have to endure that

1:32:49.069 --> 1:32:50.612
and other things too.

1:32:51.530 --> 1:32:52.906
Wendy, I'm so sorry.

1:32:54.199 --> 1:32:55.701
I'm so, so sorry.

1:32:55.784 --> 1:32:57.828
I know it's such
a little word.

1:33:00.330 --> 1:33:02.082
I left because I had to.

1:33:03.250 --> 1:33:04.793
I've no excuse.

1:33:06.170 --> 1:33:07.671
And I had no choice.

1:33:09.214 --> 1:33:11.550
My reality had
just become this cage

1:33:11.633 --> 1:33:13.468
and I wanted freedom.

1:33:18.307 --> 1:33:20.058
I was selfish.

1:33:23.103 --> 1:33:24.855
I should have
been there to protect you.

1:33:27.357 --> 1:33:29.860
I so wish that
I had done better.

1:33:32.362 --> 1:33:34.072
You could've done better.

1:33:36.825 --> 1:33:37.826
But...

1:33:39.119 --> 1:33:41.872
isn't that true
for just about anybody?

1:33:47.294 --> 1:33:49.046
You seem to be doing very well.

1:33:49.129 --> 1:33:50.130
Me?

1:33:51.465 --> 1:33:53.592
I'm a disaster, Mom.

1:33:54.259 --> 1:33:57.054
But I am trying
to make some improvement.

1:33:58.096 --> 1:33:59.848
Especially with Berry.

1:34:00.849 --> 1:34:01.850
Berry.

1:34:03.060 --> 1:34:05.187
What a wild thing she is.

1:34:05.437 --> 1:34:06.647
Just like you.

1:34:08.398 --> 1:34:09.608
And you.

1:34:09.775 --> 1:34:11.360
And my mother.

1:34:13.779 --> 1:34:15.113
You see, Wendy,

1:34:16.365 --> 1:34:18.200
when I was a little girl, I--

1:34:18.951 --> 1:34:21.203
I couldn't wait to...

1:34:21.286 --> 1:34:23.330
grow up and fly away.

1:34:25.415 --> 1:34:28.293
Because I wanted
so much to be like her.

1:35:01.034 --> 1:35:04.830
Peter, do you expect me

1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:06.874
Of course,
that is why I've come.

No, don't turn up the light.

I came back for my mother.

1:36:48.058 --> 1:36:49.685
To take her to Neverland.
