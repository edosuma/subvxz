WEBVTT

00:00.102 --> 00:02.883
<i>People have come from all
over the city to mourn.</i>

00:03.039 --> 00:04.907
<i>The grief is palpable.</i>

00:04.975 --> 00:05.908
But the lights from these candles

00:05.976 --> 00:07.843
have never shone brighter.

00:07.911 --> 00:10.846
Pizza Rat, dead tonight
at the age of four.

00:10.914 --> 00:11.914
Kit.

00:11.982 --> 00:13.315
All right, Haley, thank you for that.

00:13.383 --> 00:14.917
I think it's gonna be a long,
sad night for all of us, huh?

00:14.985 --> 00:16.652
2017 strikes again.

00:16.720 --> 00:17.786
Indeed it does.

00:17.854 --> 00:19.655
In other news, we are just days away now

00:19.723 --> 00:22.558
from the start of a trial
for NYPD detectives

00:22.625 --> 00:24.526
Jake Peralta and Rosa Diaz.

00:24.594 --> 00:26.061
<i>They were arrested two months ago</i>

00:26.129 --> 00:27.763
<i>for a whole string of bank robberies.</i>

00:27.831 --> 00:29.098
The pair are currently out on bail

00:29.165 --> 00:32.735
but, if convicted, face
up to 15 years in prison.

00:32.802 --> 00:34.937
Yeah, Anna, these disgraced
detectives were apprehended

00:35.005 --> 00:37.840
after a months-long
investigation by hero cop

00:37.907 --> 00:39.508
Lieutenant Melanie Hawkins.

00:39.576 --> 00:40.676
They're guilty.

00:40.744 --> 00:42.511
Super duper guilty.

00:42.579 --> 00:44.613
While there is little to
no public information

00:44.681 --> 00:46.915
about Detective Diaz, Channel 12

00:46.983 --> 00:49.218
has learned this isn't the first time

00:49.285 --> 00:51.720
Peralta has been on the
wrong side of the law.

00:51.788 --> 00:53.956
We just uncovered cell phone footage

00:54.024 --> 00:56.225
from a Criss Angel magic show.

00:56.292 --> 00:57.760
I just want to know how he did it.

00:57.827 --> 00:59.528
He's a mind freak!

00:59.596 --> 01:00.696
A mind freak!

01:21.117 --> 01:22.918
Okay, update on our trial prep.

01:22.986 --> 01:24.887
This is our lawyer, Samuel Miller,

01:24.954 --> 01:26.889
who, in many ways, is in
charge of our defense.

01:26.956 --> 01:27.990
In every way.

01:28.058 --> 01:29.024
Well, "many" is part of "every."

01:29.092 --> 01:29.892
I'm facing 15 years in prison.

01:29.959 --> 01:30.993
st let me have this.

01:31.061 --> 01:33.896
Okay. So, prosecution's case is strong.

01:33.963 --> 01:35.931
You two were caught
red-handed robbing a bank

01:35.999 --> 01:38.734
by one of the NYPD's
most esteemed detectives

01:38.802 --> 01:40.636
in front of two dozen eyewitnesses.

01:40.703 --> 01:42.604
Right, but can't Captain
Holt just testify

01:42.672 --> 01:43.739
he knew you were trying to

01:43.807 --> 01:45.074
take down Hawkins from the inside?

01:45.141 --> 01:46.408
Unfortunately, no.

01:46.476 --> 01:47.910
Legally you can't testify
for your best friend.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.011
- That's not a law.
- No?

01:49.079 --> 01:50.345
- Sam?
- Not a law.

01:50.413 --> 01:51.814
Well, point is, he didn't
deny we're best friends.

01:51.881 --> 01:52.948
The investigation was off the books.

01:53.016 --> 01:54.917
There's no evidence
proving it even existed.

01:54.984 --> 01:56.618
Doesn't matter anyway. We
don't need your testimony,

01:56.686 --> 01:58.754
because we have... the meat fork.

01:58.822 --> 01:59.755
What?

01:59.823 --> 02:01.290
Our two-pronged defense.

02:01.357 --> 02:03.292
Not unlike a fork you would use
to flip a steak on a grill.

02:03.359 --> 02:04.326
It's a meat fork!

02:04.394 --> 02:05.761
Sam, explain the meat fork to them.

02:05.829 --> 02:07.629
Again, "meat fork" is fun,

02:07.697 --> 02:08.697
but under no circumstances should

02:08.764 --> 02:09.698
anyone say that in court.

02:09.765 --> 02:10.765
We have it if we need it.

02:10.834 --> 02:11.767
Tell them about the first prong.

02:11.835 --> 02:13.102
We have airtight alibis

02:13.169 --> 02:14.837
for the other three bank robberies

02:14.904 --> 02:16.305
you all are accused of.

02:16.372 --> 02:17.840
Yes, I pulled time sheets,
witness statements,

02:17.907 --> 02:18.974
and security footage.

02:19.042 --> 02:20.375
We can show that both
of you weren't present

02:20.443 --> 02:22.678
at any of the other robberies, except...

02:22.745 --> 02:25.013
March 12th. Still not
sure where Rosa was.

02:25.081 --> 02:26.048
And you never will be.

02:26.116 --> 02:27.616
Okay, reminder: privacy is cool,

02:27.684 --> 02:28.717
but if you don't tell us,

02:28.785 --> 02:30.719
we're gonna go to jail for a long time.

02:30.787 --> 02:32.054
Fine.

02:32.122 --> 02:33.655
I was at a "La La Land" sing-along.

02:33.723 --> 02:34.790
Really?

02:34.858 --> 02:35.958
- What's that?
- Enough.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.793
- Just move on to the next prong.
- Yep.

02:37.861 --> 02:40.062
Prosecution claims you
stole $26 million,

02:40.130 --> 02:42.064
but they can't trace that
money to you in any way.

02:42.132 --> 02:44.333
Yeah, I have negative
$73 in my bank account.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.501
Ba-boom!

02:45.568 --> 02:46.668
I'm somehow embarrassed and proud of you

02:46.736 --> 02:47.669
at the same time.

02:47.737 --> 02:48.871
Yeah, that's my sweet spot.

02:48.938 --> 02:49.872
Okay, so that's where we stand.

02:49.939 --> 02:51.340
Are there any questions or comments?

02:51.407 --> 02:52.908
Yes, there's something I'd like to say.

02:54.210 --> 02:55.177
Don't lose.

02:55.245 --> 02:57.012
Thought that was gonna be longer.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.814
- I loved it.
- It was perfect.

02:58.882 --> 03:01.650
Hey, Boyle. How you doing there, bud?

03:01.718 --> 03:03.352
I'm fine. I'm great.

03:03.419 --> 03:04.820
Well, I hear your mouth say that,

03:04.888 --> 03:06.989
but the rest of your head is
telling a different story.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.690
Feels like the stress
of the upcoming trial

03:08.758 --> 03:09.791
is starting to get to you.

03:09.859 --> 03:11.360
Oh, is this about my hair turning white?

03:11.427 --> 03:12.895
Yes, definitely.

03:12.962 --> 03:14.930
It's not just the head hair.

03:14.998 --> 03:16.899
It's all of it.

03:16.966 --> 03:19.067
All. Of. It.

03:19.135 --> 03:20.169
I get it.

03:20.236 --> 03:21.103
It's like an Eagles concert down there.

03:21.171 --> 03:22.137
Nothing but whites.

03:22.205 --> 03:24.006
Understood. You got white pubes.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.707
There's no need to stress out.

03:25.775 --> 03:26.942
The lawyer's very confident.

03:27.010 --> 03:28.076
Not good enough.

03:28.144 --> 03:29.678
I need to do everything
I can to save Jake.

03:29.746 --> 03:31.380
Charles, you're falling apart.

03:31.447 --> 03:33.015
And that's not helping anyone.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.383
You need to get your crap in order.

03:34.450 --> 03:40.022
Okay, you're right. I'll take a nap.

03:40.089 --> 03:42.891
I'll eat. I'll dye my pubes.

03:42.959 --> 03:43.926
You can dye all your hair.

03:43.993 --> 03:46.728
No. There's no time.

03:46.796 --> 03:49.431
Hey. Big day. How you feeling?

03:49.499 --> 03:50.632
Good. Good.

03:50.700 --> 03:51.867
I was just working on my innocent face.

03:51.935 --> 03:53.035
Check it out.

03:53.102 --> 03:54.736
"I'm a nice boy."

03:54.804 --> 03:55.737
Oh, no. I don't think that's doing

03:55.805 --> 03:56.772
what you want it to at all.

03:56.839 --> 03:58.740
Oh. Well, it doesn't matter,

03:58.808 --> 03:59.875
because my normal face
is my innocent face,

03:59.943 --> 04:00.976
because I'm innocent.

04:01.044 --> 04:03.045
I know. I just hope the jury knows too.

04:03.112 --> 04:04.146
Should we talk about what happens

04:04.214 --> 04:05.814
if they somehow find you guilty?

04:05.882 --> 04:06.815
That's not happening.

04:06.883 --> 04:07.950
But what we should talk about

04:08.017 --> 04:09.384
is how we're gonna celebrate when I win.

04:09.452 --> 04:11.920
I'm thinking we take a trip
to Paris or London, Rome,

04:11.988 --> 04:12.955
anywhere Jason Bourne

04:13.022 --> 04:14.156
has driven a car down some stairs.

04:14.224 --> 04:16.124
Paris sounds fun. Or we could just go

04:16.192 --> 04:17.492
somewhere we could actually afford.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.493
Oh, we can afford it.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.894
Don't forget I robbed a bank.

04:19.963 --> 04:22.096
I'm sitting on $26 million, baby!

04:22.165 --> 04:23.098
Excuse me?

04:23.166 --> 04:24.099
Oh! He's just kidding.

04:24.167 --> 04:25.100
Yeah, I'm innocent.

04:25.168 --> 04:26.235
You'll see when we get in there.

04:26.302 --> 04:28.470
Nice talking to you, Judge.

04:28.538 --> 04:29.905
Okay, you ready?

04:29.973 --> 04:31.106
Yeah.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.109
I love you.

04:34.177 --> 04:35.911
I know. Han Solo.

04:35.979 --> 04:37.012
Love you too.

04:38.314 --> 04:39.748
You got this.

04:41.050 --> 04:42.918
You got this.

04:42.986 --> 04:44.186
You got this.

04:45.221 --> 04:46.989
- Charles, you're...
- In a wheelchair, yep.

04:47.056 --> 04:48.957
My back gave out when I
was dyeing my pubes.

04:49.025 --> 04:50.525
I was only halfway done.

04:50.593 --> 04:51.927
I'm like Cruella de Vil down there.

04:51.995 --> 04:53.228
Okay, well,

04:53.296 --> 04:54.997
I need to go be on trial
for bank robbery now,

04:55.064 --> 04:56.198
so maybe we can talk about this later?

04:56.266 --> 04:58.267
Oh, right. Good luck.

04:58.334 --> 04:59.268
Good luck to you.

04:59.335 --> 05:00.469
- About the...
- Yes.

05:00.536 --> 05:01.803
Thank you.

05:01.871 --> 05:02.904
Okay.

05:04.173 --> 05:06.275
Psst! Hey, Jake.

05:06.342 --> 05:07.276
I got you. Don't worry about it.

05:07.343 --> 05:08.477
Really? How?

05:08.544 --> 05:10.946
Among my many, many, many skills,

05:11.014 --> 05:12.281
I'm fluent in face.

05:12.348 --> 05:13.815
I can tell you what the jury's thinking

05:13.883 --> 05:14.950
at any given moment.

05:15.018 --> 05:17.152
I see an eyebrow twitch, I'm like, "Oh."

05:17.220 --> 05:19.121
If their cheek has a certain tension,

05:19.188 --> 05:20.822
okay, that leads me a different way.

05:20.890 --> 05:22.257
Watch this.

05:22.325 --> 05:25.027
Scully, you're wondering if
anyone can smell your fart.

05:25.094 --> 05:27.562
The answer, my brother, is yes.

05:27.630 --> 05:28.830
She's a witch.

05:28.898 --> 05:30.132
What'd I tell you, boy? Trust me.

05:30.199 --> 05:32.000
- I got you.
- Okay.

05:32.068 --> 05:33.035
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:33.102 --> 05:35.070
I like your stupid courtroom clothes.

05:35.138 --> 05:36.238
Thanks.

05:36.306 --> 05:37.239
I like your stupid courtroom clothes.

05:37.307 --> 05:39.508
Thank you.

05:39.575 --> 05:41.076
You know, if you had asked
me back at the Academy

05:41.144 --> 05:42.978
where I wanted to be in 12 years,

05:43.046 --> 05:44.179
I definitely would have said right here.

05:44.247 --> 05:45.981
Same.

05:46.049 --> 05:46.982
Great.

05:47.050 --> 05:48.150
So it all worked out.

05:48.217 --> 05:49.518
End of story.

05:49.585 --> 05:52.187
All rise for the honorable
Judge Marinovich.

05:52.255 --> 05:53.889
Please. You may be seated.

05:53.956 --> 05:55.090
Court is in session.

05:55.158 --> 05:56.558
Now, Miss Crunder, you were in the bank

05:56.626 --> 05:57.859
at the time of the holdup.

05:57.927 --> 05:59.161
Did you see the robbers' faces?

05:59.228 --> 06:00.162
Plain as day.

06:00.229 --> 06:01.163
They're sitting right there.

06:01.230 --> 06:02.297
Let the record show,

06:02.365 --> 06:04.266
she's pointing at Jake
Peralta and Rosa Diaz.

06:04.334 --> 06:06.868
Okay, the jurors found
that super compelling.

06:06.936 --> 06:08.003
Just an update.

06:08.071 --> 06:09.438
Thanks, Gina.

06:09.505 --> 06:11.039
So, like, you're not making
a good first impression.

06:11.107 --> 06:12.040
Right. Thank you.

06:12.108 --> 06:13.041
No doubt.

06:14.344 --> 06:16.578
Hey. Don't worry. We got this.

06:16.646 --> 06:17.646
We still have our alibis.

06:17.714 --> 06:19.247
We weren't at the first three robberies.

06:19.315 --> 06:21.183
Sure, they weren't at the
first three robberies.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.951
But that's just so they'd
have airtight alibis.

06:23.019 --> 06:24.019
Uh-oh.

06:24.087 --> 06:25.020
They were only at the last robbery

06:25.088 --> 06:26.021
'cause we were short on manpower.

06:26.089 --> 06:27.556
Our other two guys disappeared.

06:27.623 --> 06:28.924
I think those bastards killed them.

06:28.991 --> 06:29.925
- Come on.
- What?

06:29.992 --> 06:31.193
Objection. Conjecture!

06:31.260 --> 06:33.061
Sustained. Sorry, you say it.

06:33.129 --> 06:34.196
Sustained.

06:34.263 --> 06:35.330
We both sounded equally authoritative.

06:35.398 --> 06:36.565
Prong one's not looking so great.

06:36.632 --> 06:38.100
Well, that's why we have second prong.

06:38.167 --> 06:39.201
They can't tie us to the money.

06:39.268 --> 06:42.037
Just this morning, my team uncovered

06:42.105 --> 06:43.905
two accounts from the Cayman Islands

06:43.973 --> 06:46.208
controlled by Diaz and Peralta

06:46.275 --> 06:50.045
containing $26 million between them.

06:50.113 --> 06:51.213
It's okay.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.614
She has no proof.

06:52.682 --> 06:54.583
These are the original applications

06:54.650 --> 06:57.619
for the accounts signed
by Diaz and Peralta.

06:57.687 --> 06:59.588
This is the affidavit
from the bank manager

06:59.655 --> 07:02.124
identifying them as the
owners of the account,

07:02.191 --> 07:04.960
and these are the deposit
slips for the entire amount.

07:05.027 --> 07:05.994
Oh, no. Rosa,

07:06.062 --> 07:06.995
we don't have any more prongs.

07:07.063 --> 07:07.996
We're prongless.

07:08.064 --> 07:09.164
Oh, and one more thing.

07:09.232 --> 07:10.232
They're guilty.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.500
No, we are not.

07:11.567 --> 07:13.235
Please don't address the jury, Mr.
Peralta.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.137
But... but... but...

07:15.204 --> 07:17.406
One more "but," and you
will be in contempt.

07:17.473 --> 07:18.940
"One more 'but'
and you're contempt,"

07:19.008 --> 07:20.075
name of your sex tape.

07:20.526 --> 07:22.181
Okay, I know it looks bad.

07:22.284 --> 07:24.219
But it also looked bad for
Liam Neeson in "The Grey."

07:24.286 --> 07:26.154
He got torn up by wolves in that movie.

07:26.222 --> 07:27.155
That's how it ends?

07:27.223 --> 07:28.256
Oh, man. That is depressing.

07:28.324 --> 07:30.058
Why would someone make
a movie about that?

07:30.125 --> 07:31.125
Okay, here's how the jury's feeling

07:31.193 --> 07:32.627
from left to right, L to R:

07:32.695 --> 07:35.163
not a fan of Jake, not of a fan of Rosa,

07:35.231 --> 07:37.065
not a fan of me, bathroom incident...

07:37.132 --> 07:38.433
We get it. They all hate us.

07:38.501 --> 07:39.634
In toto, yes.

07:39.702 --> 07:41.436
Some good news. I spoke to the judge,

07:41.504 --> 07:44.138
and he's giving us an extra day
to review the new evidence.

07:44.206 --> 07:45.306
What are they gonna find in one day?

07:45.374 --> 07:47.308
Face it, man, we are going to jail.

07:47.376 --> 07:49.310
We might as well start hiding
razor blades under our tongues.

07:49.378 --> 07:51.646
Here. You can have one of mine.

07:51.714 --> 07:53.114
How long has that been in there?

07:53.182 --> 07:54.482
- Since grade school.
- Yeah, that checks out.

07:54.550 --> 07:55.984
No one's going to jail.
We're gonna work this case,

07:56.051 --> 07:57.085
and we're gonna find something.

07:57.152 --> 07:58.219
You're not gonna sit back

07:58.287 --> 07:59.654
and resign yourselves to your fates.

07:59.722 --> 08:00.788
You're gonna take action.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.690
Now, Hawkins can destroy your alibis

08:02.758 --> 08:04.325
and put money in your accounts...

08:04.393 --> 08:05.460
Wait, sir.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.262
I think Hawkins just
made her first mistake.

08:07.329 --> 08:08.463
What are you talking about?

08:08.531 --> 08:09.564
Well, the money that she
put into our accounts

08:09.632 --> 08:11.699
didn't just appear out
of thin air, right?

08:11.767 --> 08:13.668
Right. It was transferred
in from somewhere.

08:13.736 --> 08:15.203
We just have to trace
it back to its source.

08:15.271 --> 08:17.005
Which would be Lieutenant Hawkins.

08:17.072 --> 08:18.206
But those are offshore accounts.

08:18.274 --> 08:19.407
We can't subpoena them.

08:19.475 --> 08:20.341
So we need to break in
to the bank's computers.

08:20.409 --> 08:21.342
We need a hacker.

08:21.410 --> 08:22.343
Does anyone know a hacker?

08:22.411 --> 08:23.344
Boyle does.

08:23.412 --> 08:24.679
I'm Boyle!

08:24.747 --> 08:26.347
I get to help!

08:26.415 --> 08:27.382
Oh, my God.

08:27.449 --> 08:29.717
I can feel my legs again.

08:31.754 --> 08:32.986
I can walk.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.355
Yes! It's a miracle kind of.

08:34.423 --> 08:36.024
See? When the Nine-Nine

08:36.091 --> 08:37.191
puts our brains together,
we can achieve anything.

08:37.259 --> 08:39.193
Hey, we should team up
and rob banks for real!

08:39.260 --> 08:41.361
You should stop talking in the hallway.

08:41.429 --> 08:43.364
Yep, copy that. Nice to see you.

08:43.432 --> 08:44.365
Okay, Boyle,

08:44.433 --> 08:45.600
tell us about your hacker.

08:45.668 --> 08:47.201
Okay, he goes by the handle "Pandemic,"

08:47.269 --> 08:49.137
and there's not a
network he can't crack.

08:49.204 --> 08:50.371
He's a phantom, a ghost.

08:50.439 --> 08:52.740
And only I know where to find him.

08:52.808 --> 08:54.208
Welcome to Hey, Hey, It's Wednesday's!,

08:54.276 --> 08:56.210
where it's never the weekend.

08:56.278 --> 08:58.012
Be right with ya.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.414
Are you sure about this hacker, Charles?

08:59.481 --> 09:01.149
I'm not getting a strong "Mr.
Robot" vibe

09:01.216 --> 09:02.150
from this place.

09:02.217 --> 09:03.251
Yeah, that's because the only thing

09:03.319 --> 09:05.720
Pandemic loves more
than hackin' computers

09:05.788 --> 09:08.256
is hackin' into a big old fried onion.

09:08.324 --> 09:09.424
Oh, there he is.

09:09.491 --> 09:12.360
Hey guys, welcome to the Quarantine.

09:12.428 --> 09:14.062
Help yourselves to some potstickers.

09:14.129 --> 09:15.129
Best eaten when hot.

09:15.197 --> 09:16.431
No thanks. Here are the account numbers

09:16.498 --> 09:18.199
for the bank where the money showed up.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.500
Now, we're in a real hurry.

09:19.568 --> 09:21.169
You think you can trace
it back to its source?

09:21.236 --> 09:22.770
Are you questioning my abilities?

09:22.838 --> 09:24.839
Watch this. What's your name?

09:24.907 --> 09:27.041
- Why do you need...
- Terrence Vincent Jeffords.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.276
Wait. What's happening?

09:28.344 --> 09:29.277
You're getting hacked, bro.

09:29.345 --> 09:30.545
That's what's happening.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.080
- Don't do that.
- I'm in your home computer.

09:32.147 --> 09:33.314
You are? Get out.

09:33.382 --> 09:35.283
You got a lot of songs
by Natalie Imbruglia.

09:35.351 --> 09:37.251
Uh, I bought those back in the '90s.

09:37.319 --> 09:38.319
Nope. Downloaded on Thursday.

09:38.387 --> 09:41.089
Okay, now watch the Pandemic spread.

09:41.156 --> 09:43.524
There's a document in here
that looks to be fan fiction

09:43.592 --> 09:45.293
for the show "Madam Secretary."

09:45.361 --> 09:46.527
Oh, Sarge, I didn't know

09:46.595 --> 09:48.429
you were a fan of the Madam.

09:48.497 --> 09:50.131
The show leaves Terry wanting more.

09:50.199 --> 09:51.532
I'm just filling in the gaps!

09:51.600 --> 09:53.201
Now get to hacking.

09:53.268 --> 09:55.770
Guys, I think I found something.

09:55.838 --> 09:56.904
Is it my heart medicine?

09:56.972 --> 09:58.539
My doctor said that if
I miss even one dose,

09:58.607 --> 09:59.807
I could have a massive stro...

09:59.875 --> 10:01.542
No, Scully, this is important.

10:01.610 --> 10:03.211
I was going through the arrest reports

10:03.278 --> 10:04.779
filed by everyone in Hawkins' squad.

10:04.847 --> 10:06.047
We already went over these.

10:06.115 --> 10:07.782
Right, but there was
one guy we didn't flag

10:07.850 --> 10:09.217
because he was never
the arresting officer:

10:09.284 --> 10:10.785
Detective Matthew Langdon.

10:10.853 --> 10:12.320
I think something went down
between him and Hawkins.

10:12.388 --> 10:14.088
Well, he had a stellar 14-year career

10:14.156 --> 10:15.390
Before joining Hawkins's squad.

10:15.457 --> 10:19.160
Then, three months later,
he quit the force entirely.

10:19.228 --> 10:21.095
He didn't just quit. He disappeared.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.430
No tax records. No known address.

10:22.498 --> 10:24.399
His wife filed a missing persons report.

10:24.466 --> 10:27.101
But after doing some
incredible sleuthing,

10:27.169 --> 10:28.569
I think I figured out where he is.

10:28.637 --> 10:30.104
Ames, how would you like to take

10:30.172 --> 10:31.472
a romantic trip to the town of...

10:31.540 --> 10:32.840
"Horseditch, Pennsylvania"?

10:32.908 --> 10:33.841
Ooh.

10:33.909 --> 10:34.909
The Paris of the mud belt?

10:34.977 --> 10:35.910
Oui, oui.

10:35.978 --> 10:37.178
Wee-wee.

10:37.246 --> 10:38.179
Anyway, it's huge stakes.

10:38.247 --> 10:39.247
We should get going.

10:39.314 --> 10:40.448
Good luck.

10:40.516 --> 10:41.983
Has anyone seen Diaz?

10:42.051 --> 10:43.284
She's supposed be looking into
the first two bank robberies.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.485
I saw her outside the courthouse.

10:44.553 --> 10:46.487
She gave me her jacket

10:46.555 --> 10:48.156
and her motorcycle helmet.

10:48.223 --> 10:49.824
Why would she give you
her favorite jacket?

10:49.892 --> 10:51.626
Because I'm a rebel, and we're in love.

10:51.694 --> 10:52.927
Doi.

10:56.231 --> 10:57.432
Diaz, I've been calling you.

10:57.499 --> 10:58.499
Why weren't you answering your phone?

10:58.567 --> 10:59.834
Don't have it.

10:59.902 --> 11:00.635
I charged it and stuck it
on a truck headed west.

11:00.703 --> 11:01.903
What's with the suitcase?

11:01.905 --> 11:02.837
- Going to Malaysia.
- You're going to Malaysia?

11:02.839 --> 11:04.153
No, the suitcase
is going to Malaysia.

11:04.239 --> 11:04.939
I'm getting on a bus to Florida.

11:05.007 --> 11:05.973
What's in Florida?

11:06.041 --> 11:07.175
Airport. I'm flying to Argentina.

11:07.242 --> 11:08.509
- This is very complicated.
- Thank you.

11:08.577 --> 11:09.644
Adrian has a ranch in the Andes

11:09.712 --> 11:11.012
where he goes when he's on the run.

11:11.080 --> 11:13.347
He's already there, getting
rid of the scorpions.

11:13.415 --> 11:15.183
adding more scorpions.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.651
I don't know. The
reception was real bad.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.186
Diaz, I know you're scared,

11:18.253 --> 11:19.287
but things are starting to turn around.

11:19.354 --> 11:20.521
We're on the money trail,

11:20.589 --> 11:22.156
and we just found a new lead.

11:22.224 --> 11:23.524
With all due respect, sir,

11:23.592 --> 11:25.493
both you and I know that none
of that is gonna pan out.

11:25.561 --> 11:27.328
And you said yourself
I should take action.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.197
So I am, in Argentina,

11:29.264 --> 11:30.631
surrounded by scorpions.

11:30.699 --> 11:31.866
Or not surrounded by scorpions.

11:31.934 --> 11:32.867
I'll find out when I get there.

11:32.935 --> 11:34.569
Look. I know you're innocent,

11:34.636 --> 11:36.537
but fleeing the country is a crime.

11:36.605 --> 11:38.172
I could arrest you right here.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.407
Do it then.

11:41.443 --> 11:42.910
I didn't think so.

11:45.380 --> 11:46.481
The mortgage is paid off.

11:46.548 --> 11:47.882
You can give the place
to whoever you want.

11:47.950 --> 11:48.983
I don't care.

11:51.386 --> 11:53.221
Actually, I do care.

11:53.288 --> 11:54.956
Don't give it to Hitchcock.

11:56.759 --> 11:59.560
I'll have the Mid-Week Potato Leak soup,

11:59.628 --> 12:01.195
and he'll have a "There's Work Tomorrow

12:01.263 --> 12:03.030
So Be Cool Frozen Margarita."

12:04.266 --> 12:05.199
Who are you?

12:05.267 --> 12:06.634
You can call me Nightmare.

12:06.702 --> 12:08.503
But for check writing purposes,
it's Jennifer Huggins.

12:08.570 --> 12:09.904
The bank's encryption turned out to be

12:09.972 --> 12:11.339
more secure than I thought,

12:11.406 --> 12:12.340
so I had to bring in a friend.

12:12.407 --> 12:14.408
Just tell us if this is impossible.

12:14.476 --> 12:15.576
We don't have a lot of time to waste,

12:15.644 --> 12:17.912
and we've been here, like,
five hours already.

12:17.980 --> 12:20.214
Huh. You don't think I can do this?

12:20.282 --> 12:21.415
Is it because I'm a woman?

12:21.483 --> 12:22.617
No, no, I didn't say that.

12:22.684 --> 12:24.218
- I think women are amazing.
- Thank you.

12:24.286 --> 12:25.419
And now I'm about to hack your world

12:25.487 --> 12:26.954
into pieces, old man.

12:27.022 --> 12:28.122
That'll show you.

12:28.190 --> 12:29.357
No. Just do the thing with the bank.

12:29.424 --> 12:30.925
- That'll show me.
- Whoa.

12:30.993 --> 12:33.361
Looks like someone was a
catalog model in Japan.

12:33.428 --> 12:34.929
Whoa! Those boots.

12:34.997 --> 12:35.963
That slicker.

12:36.031 --> 12:37.532
The no pants.

12:37.599 --> 12:39.600
Who's the target audience
for these pics, Sarge?

12:39.668 --> 12:41.035
I was a starving student.

12:41.103 --> 12:43.237
Terry needed the yen!

12:43.305 --> 12:45.439
Babe, are you sure we're
in the right place?

12:45.507 --> 12:47.241
This looks like where
they shot "The Village."

12:47.309 --> 12:48.709
Amy, don't say things like that.

12:48.777 --> 12:50.278
You're gonna scare me. You know that.

12:50.345 --> 12:52.713
I think Langdon's wife's
been secretly visiting him.

12:52.781 --> 12:55.049
She posted a photo in
March of a snowstorm,

12:55.117 --> 12:56.951
but there was no snow in New York.

12:57.019 --> 12:59.954
The picture was geotagged right...

13:00.022 --> 13:01.255
here.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.990
"Flaxton Hill Farms."

13:03.058 --> 13:05.393
Check it out. There's a
car in the driveway.

13:05.460 --> 13:06.661
Somebody's home.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.398
Matthew Langdon? Are you there?

13:10.465 --> 13:12.733
We'd like to talk to you
about Melanie Hawkins.

13:14.036 --> 13:15.269
Whoa!

13:15.337 --> 13:16.237
Don't shoot!

13:16.305 --> 13:18.072
But seriously, don't. Don't shoot.

13:20.122 --> 13:22.911
If I were you I'd turn
around and start walking.

13:23.099 --> 13:26.368
Because in about three seconds,
I'm gonna start shooting.

13:26.436 --> 13:28.203
Oh, God. He did the gun cock.

13:28.271 --> 13:29.238
This is escalating much too quickly,

13:29.306 --> 13:30.272
and three seconds is not enough time...

13:30.340 --> 13:31.373
- Jake...
- Right, focus. Sorry.

13:31.441 --> 13:33.375
Sir, we know you worked with Hawkins.

13:33.443 --> 13:34.376
Did she send you here?

13:34.444 --> 13:35.377
- No.
- No.

13:35.445 --> 13:36.812
We're not with her.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.047
We're like the opposite of that.

13:38.114 --> 13:39.048
She set me and my friend up.

13:39.115 --> 13:40.049
We could go to jail.

13:40.116 --> 13:41.817
Why should I believe you?

13:41.885 --> 13:43.886
Look, if you let me slowly
reach into my jacket pocket,

13:43.954 --> 13:45.187
there's an article open on my phone

13:45.255 --> 13:48.057
that will explain everything.

13:48.124 --> 13:51.060
That's a video of a
monkey humping a frog.

13:51.127 --> 13:52.061
What?

13:52.128 --> 13:53.395
Oh. That's my bad.

13:53.463 --> 13:55.397
It was a long ride up
here, and I got bored.

13:55.465 --> 13:57.066
Here. Close that tab.

13:57.133 --> 13:58.033
That's the article.

13:58.101 --> 13:59.068
Hawkins ran you out of New York

13:59.135 --> 14:00.302
and took away your life.

14:00.370 --> 14:02.838
If you help us, maybe we
can help you get it back.

14:02.906 --> 14:04.907
Fine. I'll talk to you,

14:04.975 --> 14:07.242
but you gotta follow me; I
gotta go feed the hogs.

14:07.310 --> 14:08.243
Oh, my God, what are
you gonna feed them?

14:08.311 --> 14:09.244
Is it us?

14:09.312 --> 14:10.245
Corn.

14:10.313 --> 14:11.480
Hmm, corn.

14:11.548 --> 14:13.415
Maize, as there was at
the first Thanksgiving.

14:13.483 --> 14:14.416
- Jake.
- Right.

14:14.484 --> 14:15.417
Let's go talk.

14:15.485 --> 14:17.052
All right, guys.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.320
Let's order a round of "Hey, Hey,

14:18.388 --> 14:19.989
It's Light Beer, Light
Beer" and get into it.

14:20.056 --> 14:21.256
Um, who is this guy?

14:21.324 --> 14:22.925
These offshore banks
are incredibly secure,

14:22.993 --> 14:24.426
so we needed more manpower.

14:24.494 --> 14:26.095
But what makes you think
that he would be...

14:26.162 --> 14:28.263
Charles, don't talk.

14:28.331 --> 14:29.331
Do not challenge

14:29.399 --> 14:32.101
this very capable gentleman in any way.

14:32.168 --> 14:33.102
Just let him get to work.

14:33.169 --> 14:34.536
Okay, thanks.

14:34.604 --> 14:36.438
So you understand we're not
questioning your ability at all.

14:36.506 --> 14:37.740
Of course not.

14:37.807 --> 14:39.441
But I don't know you guys,
so just to be safe,

14:39.509 --> 14:42.111
I did dig up some dirt on
you to use as blackmail

14:42.178 --> 14:43.445
in case things go south.

14:43.513 --> 14:44.913
On both of us?

14:44.981 --> 14:46.015
- Just Terry Jeffords.
- Yup.

14:46.082 --> 14:48.050
Or should I say Sir-Dance-Alot?

14:48.118 --> 14:49.118
Oh, come on!

14:49.185 --> 14:50.653
<i>Turn the volume up!</i>

14:50.720 --> 14:53.088
<i>Mommy can't hear us in Da Bassment.</i>

14:53.156 --> 14:55.124
Oof. at's embarrassing.

14:55.191 --> 14:58.427
Sarge, you gotta
scrub-a-dub-dub that profile.

14:58.495 --> 15:01.130
Oof. It's pungent out here.

15:01.197 --> 15:02.364
It's so weird how food smells so good

15:02.432 --> 15:04.033
but farms smell so bad.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.068
Yeah, I think that every day.

15:06.136 --> 15:07.436
So... Hawkins?

15:07.504 --> 15:10.305
I caught her taking payoffs
from a gang leader.

15:10.373 --> 15:12.107
When I confronted her about it,

15:12.175 --> 15:14.476
she said I could disappear
or she'd kill me.

15:14.544 --> 15:15.978
I see why you chose pig farming.

15:16.046 --> 15:17.046
It's better than death.

15:17.113 --> 15:18.313
Not during the spring thaw.

15:18.381 --> 15:20.382
Why? Does it smell even worse somehow?

15:20.450 --> 15:22.251
I was talking about the noises.

15:22.318 --> 15:23.986
It's pig mating season.

15:24.054 --> 15:26.155
What does that sound like,
a bunch of wet bagpipes?

15:26.222 --> 15:27.289
That's exactly it.

15:27.357 --> 15:29.458
- Oh. Nailed it.
- Hey. Yeah.

15:29.526 --> 15:30.359
The worst part about it is,

15:30.427 --> 15:32.327
I had to leave my wife behind.

15:32.395 --> 15:35.164
If Hawkins knew we were still together,

15:35.231 --> 15:36.498
I'm afraid she'll kill her.

15:36.566 --> 15:38.067
If you testify to this in court,

15:38.134 --> 15:41.136
it would back up everything
Jake and Rosa are saying.

15:41.204 --> 15:42.538
It could sway the jury.

15:42.605 --> 15:44.473
You could take Hawkins down
and get your life back.

15:44.541 --> 15:49.011
I've tangled with her enough
to know that she always wins.

15:49.079 --> 15:50.145
So it's a no.

15:50.213 --> 15:52.114
Come on. You're our last chance.

15:52.182 --> 15:53.315
I can't help you.

15:53.383 --> 15:55.084
That's final.

15:55.151 --> 15:56.285
Oh, my God.

16:01.091 --> 16:02.224
Is this seat taken?

16:03.526 --> 16:04.493
You really gonna do this, Diaz?

16:04.561 --> 16:06.195
My name is Rachel Weinstein.

16:06.262 --> 16:08.363
I am a graduate student on
sabbatical to study birds

16:08.431 --> 16:10.299
at the University of Buenos Aires.

16:10.366 --> 16:11.500
You know, Cornell has a far better

16:11.568 --> 16:13.135
ornithology department,

16:13.203 --> 16:14.970
and it's right here in New York.

16:15.038 --> 16:16.505
Cornell has accused me of robbing a bank

16:16.573 --> 16:18.540
and is gonna send me
to jail for 15 years.

16:18.608 --> 16:19.575
I guess we're dropping the metaphor.

16:19.642 --> 16:20.642
I don't know why you're here.

16:20.710 --> 16:21.543
You're not gonna change my mind.

16:21.611 --> 16:23.512
I know.

16:23.580 --> 16:25.114
I just wanted to say good-bye.

16:25.181 --> 16:26.381
Okay. Good-bye.

16:26.449 --> 16:27.583
I hope you know your
family's gonna miss you.

16:27.650 --> 16:29.551
I don't care. I barely speak to them.

16:29.619 --> 16:32.054
I was talking about the Nine-Nine.

16:32.122 --> 16:34.089
Be safe, Rachel Weinstein.

16:38.394 --> 16:40.462
I guess now we have to
actually talk about

16:40.530 --> 16:42.397
what happens if the
jury finds me guilty.

16:42.465 --> 16:44.066
They still might not.

16:44.134 --> 16:45.234
We could still go to Paris.

16:45.301 --> 16:47.069
Forget Paris.

16:47.137 --> 16:48.470
Billy Crystal. Nailed it.

16:48.538 --> 16:49.471
I'll wait for you.

16:49.539 --> 16:50.572
And I'll keep fighting for you

16:50.640 --> 16:53.075
and so will everyone at the Nine-Nine.

16:53.143 --> 16:56.211
We'll do whatever it takes.

16:56.279 --> 16:58.013
I love you.

16:58.081 --> 16:59.148
I love you.

16:59.215 --> 17:00.349
Okay.

17:00.416 --> 17:02.084
Let's go back to New York.

17:02.152 --> 17:03.185
You can choose the music.

17:03.253 --> 17:05.020
Just put on anything by Enya.

17:05.088 --> 17:07.222
No, not anything. "Orinoco
Flow." On repeat.

17:07.290 --> 17:08.589
Okay.

17:08.657 --> 17:09.657
Wait.

17:12.228 --> 17:13.262
I'm coming with you.

17:13.329 --> 17:15.030
You are? You'll testify?

17:15.098 --> 17:16.598
Hawkins has cost me and my wife

17:16.665 --> 17:18.500
too many years of happiness.

17:18.568 --> 17:20.602
I'm not gonna let her
do the same to you.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.436
Thank you so much.

17:22.505 --> 17:23.539
Well, I'm gonna grab my stuff,

17:23.606 --> 17:25.440
and I'll get a few CDs.

17:25.508 --> 17:27.075
Hope you like Enya.

17:27.944 --> 17:30.982
Matthew Langdon, you and
I are vibing so hard!

17:34.523 --> 17:36.250
Where are Jack and Rosa?

17:36.304 --> 17:37.237
I don't know.

17:37.305 --> 17:38.238
I'm getting worried,

17:38.306 --> 17:39.239
because the jury's getting restless,

17:39.307 --> 17:40.474
especially juror number 4.

17:40.542 --> 17:42.142
She'd rather be in Lake Havasu

17:42.210 --> 17:43.443
with her new boyfriend, Derek.

17:43.511 --> 17:44.778
I didn't get that from her face.

17:44.846 --> 17:47.080
I was eavesdropping by the
vending machine, so...

17:47.148 --> 17:48.549
I just got a text from Peralta.

17:48.616 --> 17:50.250
- He's a few minutes away.
- And Diaz?

17:50.318 --> 17:51.952
Perhaps a bit more than
a few minutes away.

17:52.020 --> 17:53.387
- I think there's a chance...
- I'm here!

17:53.454 --> 17:54.488
Sorry, traffic was a nightmare

17:54.556 --> 17:56.456
coming back from Philadelphia...

17:56.524 --> 17:58.392
cheesesteak restaurant.

17:58.459 --> 17:59.960
They do breakfast. It checks out.

18:00.028 --> 18:01.495
Okay.

18:04.299 --> 18:05.532
So what happened?

18:05.600 --> 18:07.467
I guess I wasn't ready to
say good-bye to my family.

18:07.535 --> 18:10.304
Good.

18:10.371 --> 18:12.439
Neither were we.

18:12.507 --> 18:14.508
Now what I'm picking up on
is just a genuine moment

18:14.576 --> 18:17.411
of friendship and respect.

18:17.478 --> 18:19.479
And now I'm feeling like

18:19.547 --> 18:21.415
you wish I would stop analyzing you

18:21.482 --> 18:23.217
'cause I'm ruining the moment.

18:24.586 --> 18:25.519
But you guys are so cute.

18:25.587 --> 18:26.753
I love you.

18:26.821 --> 18:29.456
All rise for the honorable
Judge Marinovich.

18:29.524 --> 18:31.425
Please, be seated. The
court is in session.

18:31.492 --> 18:33.193
Counselor, where is Mr. Peralta?

18:33.261 --> 18:34.428
Objection!

18:37.498 --> 18:44.538
<i>â™ª</i>

18:44.606 --> 18:46.273
Mr. Peralta,

18:46.341 --> 18:48.375
what is the meaning of this?

18:48.443 --> 18:50.544
Your Honor, I'd like to
call a surprise witness.

18:50.612 --> 18:52.012
You're not an attorney.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.348
Right. Sam, call a surprise witness.

18:54.415 --> 18:56.183
Okay. Uh...

18:56.251 --> 18:58.385
We'd like to call a surprise witness.

18:58.453 --> 19:00.320
The jury's like, "Oh, snap, a twist."

19:00.388 --> 19:01.355
Like, they love twists.

19:01.422 --> 19:03.390
Any great trial has a twist.

19:03.458 --> 19:04.458
I'm getting worried.

19:04.525 --> 19:05.592
We're running out of time.

19:05.660 --> 19:07.327
It's fine. This place is open 24-5.

19:07.395 --> 19:09.029
Only closed on weekends.

19:09.097 --> 19:10.364
Such a strange theme for a restaurant.

19:10.431 --> 19:12.032
Agreed. But that's not what I meant.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.400
Did you guys find anything yet?

19:13.468 --> 19:15.302
Yes. Terry made a sizable purchase

19:15.370 --> 19:17.337
at an Etsy store that
sells anklets for men.

19:17.405 --> 19:19.373
Sharon thinks they're sexy.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.375
Oh, come on! Focus on the case, man.

19:21.442 --> 19:22.542
Hey, hey, hey! I'm in!

19:22.610 --> 19:24.378
Can you state your name for the record?

19:24.445 --> 19:26.246
My name is Matthew Langdon.

19:26.314 --> 19:28.215
Mr. Langdon, do you
know Melanie Hawkins?

19:28.283 --> 19:33.086
Yes. I worked for her for
three months in 2010.

19:33.154 --> 19:34.354
And you are a retired...

19:34.422 --> 19:36.523
NYPD detective, correct?

19:36.591 --> 19:38.058
Yes, I served for 14 years.

19:38.126 --> 19:39.159
Gotcha!

19:40.728 --> 19:42.095
Sorry.

19:42.163 --> 19:43.397
Proceed.

19:43.464 --> 19:44.431
The money that was deposited

19:44.499 --> 19:45.399
was routed through five banks.

19:45.466 --> 19:47.434
Now, I can't link it to Hawkins,

19:47.502 --> 19:50.070
but the original transfer
came from this shell corp.

19:50.138 --> 19:51.405
- Huh.
- Doesn't ring a bell.

19:51.472 --> 19:52.572
I'll text the squad,

19:52.640 --> 19:54.207
see if anyone recognizes it.

19:54.275 --> 19:56.576
"Flaxton Hill Holdings."

19:58.313 --> 20:00.180
"Flaxton Hill"?

20:00.248 --> 20:01.214
Oh, no.

20:01.282 --> 20:03.517
Flaxton Hill Farms.

20:03.584 --> 20:04.685
Jake! Jake! Jake!

20:04.752 --> 20:05.752
This was a mistake.

20:05.820 --> 20:07.087
We have to get Langdon
off the stand now.

20:07.155 --> 20:08.221
What? Why?

20:08.289 --> 20:09.289
And how would you
describe the Lieutenant?

20:09.357 --> 20:10.290
He works for Hawkins.

20:10.358 --> 20:12.092
He put the money in the accounts.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.260
Oh, no.

20:13.328 --> 20:14.561
Melanie Hawkins

20:14.629 --> 20:17.230
was the most honorable
cop I ever worked with.

20:17.298 --> 20:19.433
And the only reason that I'm here

20:19.500 --> 20:21.635
is because of that man, Jake Peralta.

20:21.703 --> 20:27.107
He offered me $300,000 to lie
and say that she set 'em up.

20:29.444 --> 20:31.378
Okay, okay, this is bad.
This is really bad.

20:31.446 --> 20:34.114
But just remember, we
are not going to jail.

20:34.182 --> 20:36.116
We didn't do it. We're innocent.

20:36.184 --> 20:37.150
Guilty.

20:37.218 --> 20:38.418
On all charges.

20:39.620 --> 20:40.654
Oh.

20:40.722 --> 20:42.322
Guilty.

20:42.390 --> 20:43.623
Very cool.

20:43.691 --> 20:46.293
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool.

20:46.332 --> 20:49.714
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.855
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool.

20:53.680 --> 20:54.680
Cool.

20:56.736 --> 20:58.003
<i>Fremulon.</i>

20:58.673 --> 21:00.674
