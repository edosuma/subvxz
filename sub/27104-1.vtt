03:26.624 --> 03:28.667
Mm. Yeah, she's hot right now.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.753

to called. He wants you.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.551

He wants to book you in

-Really?

04:21.553 --> 04:22.930

Fuckin' A.

04:22.972 --> 04:24.640

also.

04:24.682 --> 04:26.642
Newspapers. They heard
all about the Lenny Bruce gig,

04:26.684 --> 04:28.477

No, it's not. There's nothing
exciting about Philadelphia.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.277

-What?

04:52.042 --> 04:53.335
No. I need you now.

-Now, Miriam, now.

04:55.838 --> 04:57.047
Now, now, now.

What is it?

What's missing?

05:01.343 --> 05:03.178

nose, hand, foot.

No blood! Ethan's fine.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.685

Oh, God.

05:09.727 --> 05:11.103

What's bad?

05:11.145 --> 05:12.521

You look fine.

05:12.563 --> 05:14.189
Your eyes are asymmetrical.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.275

Her eyes are asymmetrical?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.985

-Papa!

05:19.945 --> 05:21.780

understand what's happening.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.282

-It's your mother.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.700
Mama? What's wrong with Mama?

05:24.742 --> 05:26.160
-She's not here.
-She's...

05:26.201 --> 05:27.828
Tonight's the annual
faculty holiday party,

05:27.870 --> 05:29.288
-and she's not here?
-I...

05:29.329 --> 05:30.956
She's never missed
this party before, ever.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.332
-Well, where is she?
-I don't know.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.834
You don't?

05:33.876 --> 05:35.252
I mean, she went to Paris,

05:35.294 --> 05:36.920
but she was supposed
to be back by now.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.881
Paris? She went to Paris?
When did she go to Paris?

05:38.922 --> 05:41.258
A few days ago. She was going
on a shopping trip or something.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.052
What do you mean "or something"?

05:43.093 --> 05:44.970
It just doesn't make sense
that she would miss the party.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.598
-Papa, what did she say?
-That she was going to Paris,

05:47.639 --> 05:49.141
and she'd be back
before the party.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.559
-She said that?
-Yes.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.936
-Well, I assume she said that.
-Assume?

05:52.978 --> 05:55.022
This is a great party, Miriam.
They have a band.

05:55.064 --> 05:56.315
Papa, did you ask
when she'd be back?

05:56.356 --> 05:57.816
-Yes.
-A second ago you assumed.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.318
Asked, assumed-- same thing.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.819
-Not at all the same thing.
-Pretty close.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.780
You teach at Columbia.
They should be terrified.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.199
-Did you look around your den?
-For what?

06:05.240 --> 06:07.076
For flight information.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.912
A hotel name, a phone number,
Amelia Earhart.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.997
-There's nothing in my den.
-Papa, think hard.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.707
When Mama said
she was going to Paris,

06:13.749 --> 06:15.876
-what exactly did she say?
-I don't know.

06:15.918 --> 06:18.045
Concentrate.
Recreate the moment.

06:18.087 --> 06:20.547
I was there,
and she came in, and...

06:20.589 --> 06:23.092
-I'm going to Paris.
-Mm-hmm.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.135
I don't feel like I have
a life here anymore.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.762
Everything and everyone
that I always counted on

06:26.804 --> 06:28.097
has let me down.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.681
I don't know what
my place is here.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.975
You don't need me.
Miriam doesn't need me.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.602
I serve no purpose.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.395
I'm unhappy
and I'm tired of being unhappy,

06:35.437 --> 06:37.439
so I booked myself a flight
for tomorrow night.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.526
Zelda's making lamb for dinner.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.569
Lamb's good.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.365
-Papa, are you kidding me?!
-What?

06:46.406 --> 06:49.326
-Mama moved to Paris!
-What?! Oh, that's ridiculous.

06:49.368 --> 06:50.786
Did you hear what you just said?

06:50.828 --> 06:52.538
What?

06:52.579 --> 06:54.581
You just told me that Mama told
you she was moving to Paris.

06:54.623 --> 06:55.999
I never said that.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.376
"I don't feel like
I have a life here.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.919
"Everyone and everything

06:58.961 --> 07:00.504
that I have ever counted on
has let me down"?

07:00.546 --> 07:02.005
And you said, "Okay."

07:02.047 --> 07:03.799
No. I said lamb was okay,
and it was.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.093
Oh, good grief.

07:06.135 --> 07:08.178
Honestly, Papa,
you don't listen.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.930
-Not true.
-You don't listen to anyone.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.348
Not true.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.724
"I don't feel like
I have a life here"?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.518
Stop repeating that!

07:14.560 --> 07:17.020
All right, I'll admit that
sometimes I tune people out,

07:17.062 --> 07:19.064
but mostly because
they rarely have anything useful

07:19.106 --> 07:21.066
-or interesting to say.
-It's empty.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.402
-What?
-Her closet's empty.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.446
Her drawers are empty.
Her perfume's gone.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.407
Where's her things?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.909
-Where did they go?
-I'm guessing Paris.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.412
But what was she going to wear
to the party tonight?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.414
You didn't notice this?
You sleep right there.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.291
You live here, too.
You didn't notice either.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.542
You're her husband.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.210
You're in her closet
way more than I am.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.671
-(dishes clattering)
-Wait a minute.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.089
Wait a minute.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.216
Papa?

07:48.552 --> 07:50.429
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.015
You're in on it, aren't you?
You helped her pack?

07:53.056 --> 07:55.142
-No.
-Yeah, you're still helping her.

07:55.184 --> 07:57.186
You're packing up dishes to send
to her right now, aren't you?

07:57.227 --> 07:58.687
Only the ones
from her grandmother.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.564
You do hate those dishes.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.149
Yes, but this isn't the way
I wanted to get rid of them.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.942
Zelda, do you know where she is?

08:03.984 --> 08:06.320
-She left me the address.
-Why didn't you tell us?

08:06.361 --> 08:08.989
She said not to say anything, to
wait until Mr. Weissman asked.

08:09.031 --> 08:10.574
He's asking!
I'm asking.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.826
Zelda, please,
where is Mrs. Weissman?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.542
Was that up there
the whole time?

08:20.584 --> 08:22.669
-Yes.
-In plain view? Just like that?

08:22.711 --> 08:26.173
-Yes.
-Okay, you-- pack. You--

08:26.215 --> 08:27.799
-unpack.
-What? Why?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.635
Because, the idiot twins
are going to go to Paris

08:29.676 --> 08:31.678
-to bring your mother back.
-But...

08:31.720 --> 08:34.223
And then we'll have
a little talk about loyalty.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.099
To the person
who signs the checks,

08:36.141 --> 08:38.310
not the person you like more.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.354
American loyalty!

08:41.605 --> 08:43.607
(sighs)

"18 Bis Rue du Mail."

09:23.355 --> 09:25.357
18. 18. 18. 18.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.484
-Small bills.
-I can't find an address.

09:27.526 --> 09:30.112
Can you find a...?
Oh, that hat is fabulous.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.989
Hey, hey, small bills,
small bills.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.365
What? Oh.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.993
-DRIVER: Monsieur...
-Uh, here.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.786
The French kind.
French kind.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.162
Wow, that one's even better.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.914
Hey, hey, will you
stop shopping?

09:40.956 --> 09:42.582
Sorry.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.793
(driver speaking French)

09:44.835 --> 09:47.629
Okay, is, uh...
is this enough?

09:47.671 --> 09:50.590
(speaking French)

09:50.632 --> 09:52.509
What, wh-what, what did he say?

09:52.551 --> 09:54.052
I don't know.
I don't speak French.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.762
What do you mean
you don't speak French?

09:55.804 --> 09:56.805
I mean I don't speak French.

09:56.847 --> 09:57.889
All this time with your mother,

09:57.931 --> 09:59.349
-she never taught you French?
-No.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.143
That's the only reason
I asked you to come.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.477
(driver speaking French)

10:02.519 --> 10:04.396
-Okay, I, uh...
-Okay.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.481
Yeah, you're welcome
for the tip.

10:06.523 --> 10:09.067
For D-Day.
You pick.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.319
I think this is it.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.820
This can't be it.
It must be it.

10:11.862 --> 10:14.364
-Is there a bell?
-Maybe we should call.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.283
-Does she have a phone?
-Does she have a bell?

10:16.325 --> 10:18.952
-I don't know.
-You've just answered
both questions.

10:18.994 --> 10:20.704
-I'm nervous.
-Me, too.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.622
-What do I say?
-I think you should just

10:22.664 --> 10:24.374
go in there and be sweet.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.168
She's probably homesick by now.

10:26.209 --> 10:28.378
She's probably just waiting for
you to sweep her off her feet

10:28.420 --> 10:29.838
and carry her back
to the Upper West Side.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.215
Oh, that's gonna be murder
on my back.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.259
Be sweet.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.555
Hey, hey, hey, focus, focus.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.599
Sorry.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.022
(speaking French)

10:48.857 --> 10:51.151
Uh, good morning,
Miss, uh, Mrs.

10:51.193 --> 10:54.404
Can you help us?

10:54.446 --> 10:58.617
We're looking for
Rose Weissman.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.161
Mademoiselle Weissman.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.621
Oh, so now you speak French.

11:02.662 --> 11:07.417
Rose Weissman?
(continues in French)

11:07.459 --> 11:09.461
(shouting in French)

11:16.051 --> 11:18.053
-Uh-huh.
-(woman continues shouting)

11:25.644 --> 11:27.187
Are you sure this is right?

11:27.229 --> 11:28.605
This is the address she left.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.774
It's like a Gallic Hooverville.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.401
It's a little rustic.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.486
Everyone here has murdered
at least three people

11:34.528 --> 11:35.612
in their lifetimes.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.572
-Rose? Rose, are you here?
-(woman continues shouting)

11:37.614 --> 11:39.449
She's drafting us.
She's drafting us.

11:39.491 --> 11:41.701
Don't look her in the eye,
it'll only rile her up.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.662
-More than this?
-Rose, are you here?

11:43.703 --> 11:45.914
-Mama?
-Rose... Rose?

11:45.956 --> 11:47.916
-Mama?
-Rose.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.668
(woman continues shouting
in French)

11:49.709 --> 11:52.712
-I'm going up.
-Okay. We're going up.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.631
ABE:
I'm just gonna leave these here.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.342
-Never mind.
-Oh, God, what is that smell?

11:57.384 --> 12:01.179
It's like a dead fish
crawled inside a deader fish.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.223
-She's still coming.
-Rose?!

12:03.265 --> 12:05.100
Boy, I really wish
you knew French.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.352
Papa, look, Rose.
It says "Rose."

12:07.394 --> 12:09.312
-Rose! My Rose!
-Mama?

12:09.354 --> 12:11.022
-Mama, are you in there?
-It's your husband!

12:11.064 --> 12:14.651
Abe? Miriam? What on earth
are you doing here?

12:14.693 --> 12:16.194
We're here to see you.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.071
-Wait, you didn't wire her?
-No. Why?

12:18.113 --> 12:19.739
Papa, we had a whole
conversation where I told you

12:19.781 --> 12:20.907
to let her know we were coming.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.075
-We did?
-Yes.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.660
I have no memory of that.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.595
Oh, well, this is
a nice surprise.

12:41.636 --> 12:44.181
Would you like to come in?

12:44.222 --> 12:46.057
Hey. Sweet.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.352
What?

12:49.394 --> 12:52.731
Would you like some coffee?
I'll heat up the rechaud.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.649
I'm sorry about
the weather today.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.985
The papers actually said sun.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.528
I know how rain
depresses you two,

12:58.570 --> 13:00.447
but really, in Paris,
it's quite wonderful.

13:00.489 --> 13:01.781
So try to look past it.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.742
Oh, how was your flight?

13:03.783 --> 13:06.703
It was your first time
on a plane, wasn't it, Miriam?

13:06.745 --> 13:09.498
-Isn't air travel a marvel?
Bonjour, René.
-RENE: Bonjour, Rose.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.958
One minute you're in New York,
and the next you're here

13:12.000 --> 13:13.502
in Gay Paree.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.087
Are you hungry? I could
scrounge around for some cake.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.715
Uh, I think we're fine.

13:18.757 --> 13:21.051
Well, if you change your mind.

13:21.092 --> 13:24.429
-So, this apartment...
-Oh, isn't it charmant?

13:24.471 --> 13:26.723
This is where I lived
when I went to school here.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.141
There's no furniture.

13:28.183 --> 13:29.559
ROSE: I didn't know if
there'd be a room available.

13:29.601 --> 13:30.769
It had been a while.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.479
One chair.
There's only one chair?

13:32.521 --> 13:35.190
So I knocked on the door,
and dear sweet Marie answered.

13:35.232 --> 13:36.775
I couldn't believe my luck.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.402
-I can see the sky.
-Oh, Gitane?

13:39.444 --> 13:41.571
Me? Oh, no.
Well, sure, I guess.

13:41.613 --> 13:44.241
Oh, I was so thrilled.
I just love this view.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.701
Uh, I see a pipe
and more roof.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.787
Oh, there's a dead bird
over there, that's nice.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.330
-(coughs)
-ROSE: Oh, sorry.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.498
I thought you smoked.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.999
Not pure hellfire, no.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.334
Well, put it out;
I'll smoke it later.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.044
You'll smoke it later?

13:56.086 --> 13:58.088
(Rose speaking French)

13:59.923 --> 14:01.383
You got a dog?

14:01.424 --> 14:05.178
-ROSE:
Everyone, meet Simone. Simone.
-(Simone barks)

14:05.220 --> 14:08.223
Oh. (speaking French)

14:08.265 --> 14:09.766
-(continues in French)
-(barks)

14:09.808 --> 14:11.935
-You trained it?
-Of course.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.812
Okay. Okay, okay. Here we go.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.355
-Papa.
-No! No. No.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.190
We're done. It's over.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.608
Enough of this.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.318
-You are insane.
-Papa.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.653
Look at this place.

14:21.695 --> 14:22.862
Look at you.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.323
This is not-- I'm not--

14:25.365 --> 14:26.950
That chair is broken.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.577
-So?
-So?

14:28.618 --> 14:30.495
-Mama, we're just concerned.
-About what?

14:30.537 --> 14:31.997
You, crazy lady, you.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.082
You just took off
with no word.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.084
I told your father
I was leaving.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.586
Yes, but he doesn't remember,
so it doesn't count.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.379
Well, I'm sorry
you were worried.

14:39.421 --> 14:42.048
Ah, apology accepted.
Get your things.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.092
Pack up your one fork
and your half a plate,

14:44.134 --> 14:46.386
your used cigarette
and let's go.

14:46.428 --> 14:47.512
No.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.472
You are coming back to New York.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.182
-Right now.
-Papa, this isn't sweet.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.976
Fuck sweet. She got a dog.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.394
Let me talk to Mama
for a second.

14:54.436 --> 14:57.772
-Can you just wait?
-Wait? Wait where?

14:57.814 --> 15:00.108
There's one room
and a partial roof.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.068
The butter's hanging
from a windowsill.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.570
The bathroom--

15:03.612 --> 15:05.405
-Where is the bathroom?
-Down the hall.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.407
-Did she say "down the hall"?
-She did. We share.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.159
I think sharing a bathroom
sounds fun.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.785
Then get out more.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.996
Rose, Rose.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.582
Rose, you're angry,
and trying to prove a point.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.626
Fine. Prove it back in New York.

15:17.667 --> 15:18.877
(Simone barks)

15:18.918 --> 15:20.128
Oh, you're upsetting her.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.338
ABE:
All right, playtime's over.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.131
I am telling
that Nazi downstairs

15:23.173 --> 15:25.383
that you are leaving tonight.

15:27.093 --> 15:31.556
Why the hell didn't you teach
her to speak French?

15:31.598 --> 15:33.266
-Marie's not a Nazi.
-(Marie shouting nearby)

15:33.308 --> 15:34.893
She's just flexible.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.228
Hey, could we maybe
try this again?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.938
Somewhere else?
Maybe have some dinner?

15:38.980 --> 15:40.523
-Tonight?
-Oh, of course.

15:40.565 --> 15:43.068
Oh, I know a lovely little
bistro you would love.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.904
It's just around the corner.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.781
Here.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.949
Just give this to the cab driver
and he'll take you there.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.701
-9:00?
-Sure.

15:51.743 --> 15:52.869
We'll be there.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.954
Oh, you're bringing your father.

15:54.996 --> 15:58.625
Yeah. I thought,
"What the hell."

15:58.667 --> 15:59.959
I just saw a cockroach.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.586
It's heading right toward
your door.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.672
Do you want me to kill it
for you?

16:05.965 --> 16:08.718
ABE:
I know. Okay, I got it.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.930
So... see you at 9:00.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.019
I've missed you, Mama.

16:18.061 --> 16:20.855
I've missed me, too.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.541
(sighs)

16:39.582 --> 16:41.710
So, see, when I said
"be sweet..."

16:41.751 --> 16:43.086
I know, I know.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.421
So now what?

16:44.462 --> 16:46.172
Well, she agreed
to have dinner with us.

16:46.214 --> 16:47.799
Did she? What a sport.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.259
We should find a hotel.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.386
She agreed to have dinner.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.054
We should check in, get settled.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.515
Deigned. She deigned to dine.

16:55.557 --> 16:56.808
You know,
when Ethan acts like this,

16:56.850 --> 16:58.309
I take away his fire truck.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.353
(shouting in French)

17:08.820 --> 17:10.613
♪ I'd cry like a baby... ♪

17:10.655 --> 17:12.490
The whole room was frozen.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.452
And Lawrence said,
"What did he say?"

17:15.493 --> 17:17.120
And Curtis said, "I quit,"

17:17.162 --> 17:19.789
so Lawrence thought Curtis
was quitting

17:19.831 --> 17:21.750
and he called him
a goddamn pansy.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.877
(chuckles)
I'm sorry, Archie.

17:23.918 --> 17:25.795
You don't have
to keep apologizing.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.797
I did not mean to just walk out
on you guys like that.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.215
We were all dressed up,

17:29.257 --> 17:31.176
-had our corsages on.
-I know.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.219
You heard we didn't put out,
that's why you walked, right?

17:33.261 --> 17:34.846
Yes, that was it.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.848
(sighs) Doesn't pay to be
a nice girl anymore.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.391
♪ I'd let out a wail ♪

17:38.433 --> 17:40.518
Shit. Sally.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.479
-SAL: You going for a record?
-Yes.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.023
To go along with my
biggest asshole trophy.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.775
You know, if you talked
to your uncle...

17:46.816 --> 17:48.401
-No.
-I know he'd let you come back.

17:48.443 --> 17:50.195
-Forget it.
-You were on fire
before you left.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.279
He doesn't want to lose you now.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.031
I was drowning before I left.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.407
That place was like a tomb.

17:54.449 --> 17:55.658
A mausoleum.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.494
Filled with people who are dead.

17:57.535 --> 18:00.914
Their souls died years ago,
they just don't know it yet.

18:00.955 --> 18:03.500
-And you.
-Thank you.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.585
So what do you do now?

18:05.627 --> 18:07.337
Now I find an apartment.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.255
Tired of living
at your parents' house?

18:09.297 --> 18:11.341
What grown man wouldn't love
living with his parents?

18:11.382 --> 18:14.093
-(chuckling): Yeah? Fun?
-So fun.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.471
I stay out till they're asleep,
I get up before they're awake.

18:16.513 --> 18:17.847
Sounds exhausting.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.474
I've seen a couple of places,

18:19.516 --> 18:21.226
but I need something big enough
for Ethan to say over,

18:21.267 --> 18:22.894
but not so big
that I have to pay for it.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.480
Sure, one of those nice spacious
free one bedrooms.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.482
-If you hear of anything...
-(phone ringing)

18:27.524 --> 18:29.108
Sally's.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.861
Joel, phone.

18:31.903 --> 18:33.822
Hello?

18:33.863 --> 18:35.782
Well, what did she say it was?

18:35.824 --> 18:37.283
♪ Fourth of July... ♪

18:37.325 --> 18:38.618
Is she okay?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.036
♪ If you ever said... ♪

18:40.078 --> 18:41.371
Did she say why it's
so important?

18:41.412 --> 18:43.081
♪ You were leaving for good... ♪

18:43.122 --> 18:45.458
Okay. I'll call her right away.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.168
Thank you, Mrs. Moskowitz.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.545
Something wrong?

18:48.586 --> 18:50.255
My mother wants me to call her.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.006
♪ I'd cry like a baby ♪

18:52.048 --> 18:55.426
♪ With a busted balloon ♪

18:55.468 --> 18:57.929

-(line ringing)

18:57.971 --> 19:00.098
-SHIRLEY: Hello?
-Hello, Ma, what's wrong?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.641
Oh, Joel, hello.

19:01.683 --> 19:03.810
-What's going on?
-Nothing, why?

19:03.852 --> 19:05.645
I got a message there was
an emergency.

19:05.687 --> 19:07.814
-Who told you that?
-Ma, you called Mrs. Moskowitz,

19:07.856 --> 19:09.315
said you had to talk to me.

19:09.357 --> 19:10.733
Well, here I am. Talk.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.902
Oh, I was out of cheese.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.279
You were out of cheese.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.572
SHIRLEY:
Your father had people over

19:15.613 --> 19:16.823
and I wanted to serve cheese.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.741
-And that's it?
-Yes.

19:18.783 --> 19:21.119
Well, now I'm on the edge
of my seat, so what happened?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.287
I found some.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.913
You should go to Hollywood, Ma.

19:23.955 --> 19:25.415
They'd pay big money
for that story.

19:25.456 --> 19:26.958
It's not a story.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.877
You don't believe your mother?
Fine.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.169
You'll miss me when I'm dead.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.254
JOEL:
Okay, good-bye.

19:31.296 --> 19:32.797
Oh, shit.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.257
Is that the time?
I have to go.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.259
-You sure?
-I'm sure. I'm sorry.

19:36.301 --> 19:39.888
SAL:
That'll be eight bucks, boys.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.307
Buy yourself something nice.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.183
Boy, we're getting really good
at this drinking thing.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.060
If you're gonna do something,
do it right.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.687
If I don't get back
to the office,

19:47.729 --> 19:49.314
they're gonna think I quit, too.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.773
So, drinks tomorrow?

19:50.815 --> 19:52.191
Same place, same stool?

19:52.233 --> 19:53.443
You're on.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.278
Hey, Joel, what the hell

19:55.320 --> 19:57.363
was that tape we heard that day
at the record store?

19:57.405 --> 19:59.240
I mean, that was Midge, right?

19:59.282 --> 20:02.160
Yeah, she got drunk at a party,
started talking.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.828
Some asshole taped it.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.622
Happens to the best of us, pal.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.790
-See ya tomorrow.
-Yup.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.502
GENO: Some people say
that women aren't funny.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.879
Ah, I think the only people
who say that

20:12.921 --> 20:14.047
are men who aren't funny.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.173
Times are changing.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.466
Buy a new watch, pal.

20:16.507 --> 20:17.926
SUSIE:
Mm, I actually think people

20:17.967 --> 20:19.302
are interested in what
a woman has to say.

20:19.344 --> 20:20.720
Maybe they don't admit it.

20:20.762 --> 20:22.305
You think the fact she's
so attractive is a problem?

20:22.347 --> 20:24.223
-For who?
-Jackie.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.893
Maybe it's confusing to some,
but there's a brain there.

20:26.935 --> 20:29.187
And people are talking
about shit nowadays.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.980
The Pope, you think Bruce

20:31.022 --> 20:32.565
could've mentioned the Pope
ten years ago?

20:32.607 --> 20:34.317
Well, he sure as shit
is mentioning him now.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.944
You want another coffee?
Jackie, get him another coffee.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.279
So when she walked in here
the first night,

20:38.321 --> 20:40.198
she was raw,
but you could see it.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.951
-I sure did.
-Just the coffee, please.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.912
I'm just saying, as a man,
I saw that she had thoughts.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.497
You were here when Susie
discovered her?

20:47.538 --> 20:49.499
Was I here? I'm always here.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.292
Just waiting for something
to happen, man.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.044
It's a boring fucking place.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.379
That could change any minute,
Jackie.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.172
So what is the connection
with Lenny Bruce?

20:56.214 --> 20:58.132
-They dating?
-No, they are not dating.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.509
He's her champion.

20:59.550 --> 21:00.885
And when the best
spots the best,

21:00.927 --> 21:02.595
you can bet it's the best.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.347
Wait, cross that out.
I sound like an idiot.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.224
I just mean, he's the top,

21:06.265 --> 21:07.558
but he sees who's coming up
behind him.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.935
So where do you go from here?

21:08.977 --> 21:10.770
We'll, we're, uh,

21:10.812 --> 21:12.689
working on expanding
her profile.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.232
Articles like this
are gonna help.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.566
Uh, we're being choosy,

21:15.608 --> 21:17.568
picking the right clubs;
eventually,

21:17.610 --> 21:19.529
Mrs. Maisel's gonna be
a household name.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.489
Mark my words, pal.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.260
Can I help you guys?

21:42.301 --> 21:44.262
-This the one?
-I think so.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.972
I thought it was a girl.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.808
Yeah, it's supposed to be
a girl.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.393
Is this a girl?
This doesn't look like a girl.

21:50.435 --> 21:51.853
It came out of the club
when they said she would.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.771
-Hey, you a girl?
-I'm not sure what

21:53.813 --> 21:55.273
-the best answer is here.
-I don't think it's a girl.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.816
This is why we need
a fucking picture.

21:56.858 --> 21:57.900
Wait.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.821
I see it now.
It could be a girl.

22:01.863 --> 22:03.698
All right.
We're gonna take a walk.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.825
-Where?
-None of your business.
Just walk.

22:05.867 --> 22:07.577
-Can I finish my slice?
-Do you understand you're in

22:07.618 --> 22:09.537
-a little bit of trouble here?
-I'm picking up on that.

22:09.579 --> 22:11.664
We're gonna go somewhere, we're
gonna have a talk. Now move.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.669
(car horn honking)

22:18.880 --> 22:20.465
Nothing but roadwork.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.509
This whole town's
a crumbling shit hole.

22:23.551 --> 22:25.178
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

22:25.219 --> 22:26.554
-Stretching.
-Well, don't.

22:26.596 --> 22:29.557
(car horn honking)

22:29.599 --> 22:31.559
You work for Harry Drake, right?

22:31.601 --> 22:32.935
Who knows.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.395
Well, you do, theoretically.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.647
Shut up. That's what I know.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.275
(car horn honking)

22:39.317 --> 22:41.069
-Where are we going?
-You'll find out.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.237
Now sit back and make like
The Miracle Worker.

22:43.279 --> 22:45.198
Hey, Frank, I got to say,
I don't know how I feel

22:45.239 --> 22:46.407
about roughing up a girl.

22:46.449 --> 22:47.909
-We don't know it's a girl.
-It's a girl.

22:47.950 --> 22:49.619
Fuck you, Annie Sullivan.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.454
-Annie Sullivan could talk.
-Not in my car, she couldn't.

22:51.496 --> 22:53.081
-Doesn't seem right.
-We do what we're told.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.624
My sister's a girl.

22:54.665 --> 22:55.708
Look, it's not my favorite
assignment, either,

22:55.750 --> 22:57.085
but we chose this line of work.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.377
You want to be a garbage man?

22:58.419 --> 22:59.837
Fuck, I'd love to be
a garbage man.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.798
-Time and a half on weekends.
-Great benefits.

23:01.839 --> 23:04.509
Shut the fuck up!

23:04.550 --> 23:07.678
(car horn honks)

23:07.720 --> 23:09.388
It's nice that you like theater.

23:12.141 --> 23:15.561
MIDGE:
Zelda?

23:15.603 --> 23:17.688
Zelda?

23:17.730 --> 23:20.316
Zelda? Zelda, can you hear me?

23:20.358 --> 23:21.734
ZELDA (over phone):
Miss Miriam?

23:21.776 --> 23:22.944
Did you find Mrs. Weissman?

23:22.985 --> 23:23.986
We did.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.446
Did she get her underwear?

23:25.488 --> 23:28.074
-I did not ask.
-Tell her I sent her underwear.

23:28.116 --> 23:29.367
I will let her know.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.369
-Is Mr. Weissman calm?
-Not at all.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.037
Put two jiggers of schnapps
in his coffee.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.789
-He will fall right to sleep.
-Good tip.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.207
It works for Ethan, too.

23:36.249 --> 23:37.750
-How are the kids?
-They're fine.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.335
Mr. Maisel took Ethan
to the movies today.

23:39.377 --> 23:40.878
Oh. Th-That's great.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.381
Uh, did, um, did Mr. Maisel
leave a message?

23:43.422 --> 23:44.924
-For who?
-For me.

23:44.966 --> 23:46.509
-No.
-Did he leave a number?

23:46.551 --> 23:47.844
-No.
-Oh.

23:47.885 --> 23:49.929
But he did say if you need him,
just leave some words

23:49.971 --> 23:51.806
at his father's
and someone will tell him.

23:51.848 --> 23:53.141
So he did leave a message?

23:53.182 --> 23:54.684
Oh, yes. That's a message?

23:54.725 --> 23:57.103
-That is a message.
-Well, he left that.

23:57.145 --> 23:58.896
I am sorry for you, Miss Miriam.

23:58.938 --> 24:02.316
To lose the boy who climbs
out your window, that is hard.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.609
She's coming. She's coming.

24:03.651 --> 24:04.861
Zelda? Zelda, I have to go.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.529
Kiss the children for me.

24:06.571 --> 24:07.864
That's her, right?

24:07.905 --> 24:09.240
You don't recognize
your own wife?

24:09.282 --> 24:11.033
I haven't recognized her
since I got here.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.952
She just walked right through a
puddle. Right through a puddle!

24:12.994 --> 24:15.746
-Bonsoir, Ronan.
-Bonsoir, Rose.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.171
-MIDGE: Mama?
-Oh, there you are, Miriam.

24:23.212 --> 24:25.464
Mwah, mwah. Abe.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.725
-I guess we're walking.
-Mm-hmm.

24:35.766 --> 24:38.728
I hope you're all starving
because I am.

24:38.769 --> 24:41.189
They have the best bread
in the world.

24:41.230 --> 24:43.983
They get it from this mad,
little man around the corner.

24:44.025 --> 24:45.860
Oh, uh, no, thank you. Okay.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.820
-Proost.
-Proost.

24:47.862 --> 24:49.238
Leave him out of it.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.824
So tell me, how do you
like Paris so far?

24:51.866 --> 24:53.826
It's very Parisian.

24:53.868 --> 24:55.870
It's the most beautiful city
in the world.

24:55.912 --> 24:57.538
They talk about the light
in New York,

24:57.580 --> 25:00.041
but when the sun sets here,
it's magic.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.543
It's why all the great artists
in the world

25:02.585 --> 25:05.546
-are so drawn to this place.
-She brought the dog.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.173
(Rose speaking French)

25:07.215 --> 25:08.883
We found an adorable hotel
right near here.

25:08.925 --> 25:10.343
Oh, yes? What's it called?

25:10.384 --> 25:12.511
Le something.

25:12.553 --> 25:14.931
Oh, delicious.
(speaks French)

25:14.972 --> 25:16.349
What is this?

25:16.390 --> 25:19.227
Simone's favorite.
Steak tartare.

25:19.268 --> 25:22.230
-We're eating dog food?
-No. She's eating people food.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.940
(Rose speaking French)

25:23.981 --> 25:26.108
It's raw.
Is it supposed to be raw?

25:26.150 --> 25:28.402
ROSE: You know, you should go
to the Louvre tomorrow.

25:28.444 --> 25:31.781
Get a little culture
before you head back home.

25:31.822 --> 25:34.492
(Rose continues in French)

25:34.533 --> 25:37.954
I was thinking we could all
spend a day or so

25:37.995 --> 25:40.831
seeing the sights
before we all head back home,

25:40.873 --> 25:43.501
the collective we.
We three, we.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.754
(speaking French)

25:46.796 --> 25:49.423
Mama, did you hear what Papa
just said about the sightseeing?

25:49.465 --> 25:50.508
And the coming home?

25:50.549 --> 25:51.926
Well, sightseeing
would be lovely.

25:51.968 --> 25:52.969
What about the coming home?

25:53.010 --> 25:55.179
Oh, dear. She threw up.
We'll need a napkin.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.890
Rose, please. It's a dog.
It'll clean that up itself.

25:57.932 --> 25:59.725
Let's talk about
getting you home.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.519
I think we should have
the chicken.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.938
I know that sounds simple,
but a well-made roast chicken

26:03.980 --> 26:06.190
is the sign
of a truly great chef.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.692
Chicken sounds great.
So, tomorrow?

26:07.733 --> 26:08.943
Stay in the moment, Miriam.

26:08.985 --> 26:10.444
You need to learn
to stay in the moment.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.029
Look around.
See where you are.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.991
You're in Paris. Take it in.

26:15.032 --> 26:16.909
Internalize it.

26:28.379 --> 26:31.132
Not to cut the internalizing
short or anything,

26:31.173 --> 26:33.592
but we really do need
to make some plans.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.261
I don't make plans anymore.

26:35.303 --> 26:37.596
Because we have a life
back in New York

26:37.638 --> 26:40.141
and up until recently,
it was a pretty good life.

26:40.182 --> 26:41.434
It was fine.

26:41.475 --> 26:43.394
Ah, it was a little better
than "fine."

26:43.436 --> 26:45.271
We had D. Porthault sheets.

26:45.313 --> 26:48.107
I'm not even sure what that is,
but people always seemed

26:48.149 --> 26:49.859
so impressed when you
mentioned it to them.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.028
Yes, that did stop a room.

26:52.069 --> 26:54.447
So, what do you think?
Maybe a few more days?

26:54.488 --> 26:56.073
Mm, I don't know.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.325
A week. Two weeks.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.410
No, I have a life here, Abe.

26:59.452 --> 27:01.037
Mama, this isn't your real life.

27:01.078 --> 27:04.040
It's not?
(speaks French)

27:05.666 --> 27:07.918
Rose, will you please stop
talking to the dog?

27:07.960 --> 27:10.796
All right, Abe. My goodness.
So threatened by a little dog.

27:10.838 --> 27:13.299
I'm not threatened by a dog.

27:13.341 --> 27:15.634
I'm trying to discuss
something serious.

27:15.676 --> 27:17.470
When are you coming home?

27:17.511 --> 27:19.805
-I'm not.
-MIDGE: This is ridiculous.
Both of you.

27:19.847 --> 27:21.640
W-We need to come
to some sort of resolution here.

27:21.682 --> 27:22.933
I have to get back.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.227
I have work. I-I have children.

27:25.269 --> 27:27.104
-Then you should go.
-Not without you.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.564
-I'm happy here.
-Bullshit!

27:28.606 --> 27:30.066
-(Simone barking)
-Oh, zip it, Simone.

27:30.107 --> 27:33.027
(Rose speaking French)

27:33.069 --> 27:34.612
ABE:
Okay.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.489
I've sat here long enough.
You want to play it like that?

27:36.530 --> 27:38.407
Fine. Miriam, go home.

27:38.449 --> 27:42.286
Me? I am not going home
without my wife. Period.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.998
Now, if you'll excuse me,
my dinnertime is 6:00.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.084
Only gangsters eat at 9:00

27:48.125 --> 27:50.878
after some bootlegging
and a hot game of craps.

27:50.920 --> 27:54.340
We will continue
this nightmare tomorrow.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.760
More wine?

28:01.806 --> 28:04.308
ROSE (laughs): So, was that
a chicken or was that a chicken?

28:04.350 --> 28:05.893
That was a chicken.

28:05.935 --> 28:08.562
Mama, how long are you gonna
torture Papa like this?

28:08.604 --> 28:10.815
-Oh, your father's just fine.
-No.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.983
No, he's not fine.
He's going out of his mind.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.902
As soon as he realizes
he can put a bookshelf

28:14.944 --> 28:17.238
where my vanity is,
he'll be just fine.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.281
-I don't understand you.
-You don't?

28:19.323 --> 28:21.158
You made your point. You won.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.743
I-I know we all let you down,

28:22.785 --> 28:25.079
but you have punished us.
You've punished him.

28:25.121 --> 28:26.580
He-he came here
to say "I'm sorry."

28:26.622 --> 28:28.040
I didn't hear him say
"I'm sorry."

28:28.082 --> 28:29.625
Did you hear him say
"I'm sorry"?

28:29.667 --> 28:31.252
-You know what I mean.
-I speak two languages.

28:31.293 --> 28:32.545
I didn't hear him say
"I'm sorry"

28:32.586 --> 28:34.046
-in either one of them.
-He came here.

28:34.088 --> 28:35.840
That is "I'm sorry"
in Abe speak.

28:35.881 --> 28:38.008
-It's not good enough.
-What more does he need to do?

28:38.050 --> 28:39.677
Nothing. I'm not asking him
to do anything.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.804
-I didn't ask him to come here.
-Oh, come on.

28:41.846 --> 28:43.472
You thought
he was just gonna let you leave?

28:43.514 --> 28:45.516
I didn't think about it
in those terms.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.518
What terms
did you think of it in?

28:47.560 --> 28:50.646
I was unhappy. I didn't want
to be unhappy anymore.

28:50.688 --> 28:52.690
But you're married.
You-you have a life.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.984
You have grandchildren.
Remember your grandchildren?

28:55.025 --> 28:57.445
-I do. They're very pleasant.
-Mama.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.029
They can visit.
Ethan can learn to fish,

28:59.071 --> 29:00.698
and when Esther's old enough
to have that nose fixed,

29:00.739 --> 29:02.450
the best doctors in the world
are here for that.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.702
What about me?
Don't you miss me?

29:04.743 --> 29:07.079
-You're here.
-But I have to leave.

29:07.121 --> 29:09.415
-You'll come back.
-What about Papa?

29:09.457 --> 29:12.001
Your father's always been very
good at taking care of himself.

29:12.042 --> 29:14.795
Mama, listen to me.
You have to get over this.

29:14.837 --> 29:17.089
The world is full
of disappointments,

29:17.131 --> 29:18.716
and sometimes people
let you down.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.509
You can't just run away.

29:20.551 --> 29:22.553
What are you getting
so upset about?

29:22.595 --> 29:24.263
You made a commitment
to this man.

29:24.305 --> 29:25.723
He is your husband.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.184
You have to go back to him!

29:29.226 --> 29:31.729
Well, look who's talking.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.858
Allons-y, Simone.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.499
Hey, drunk or dead?

29:51.540 --> 29:54.168
-Drunk.
-You can tell from here?

29:54.210 --> 29:56.837
I got an eye.

29:56.879 --> 29:59.089
You play the ponies?

29:59.131 --> 30:01.342
Once in a while. To relax.

30:01.383 --> 30:03.052
My uncle played the ponies.

30:03.093 --> 30:04.553
Played every day for five years.

30:04.595 --> 30:06.347
Hmm. Then what?
He learned his lesson?

30:06.388 --> 30:07.765
I don't know.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.433
One day he disappeared,
we never saw him again.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.143
-Oh, you're kidding.
-Eh.

30:11.185 --> 30:13.270
He owed someone something.
They collected.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.688
I got his jacket, though.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.525
-Oh, sorry about that.
-Yeah.

30:17.566 --> 30:20.361
He might've just moved. Ran.

30:20.402 --> 30:22.863
We got sent a thumb.
To be totally honest,

30:22.905 --> 30:24.490
by the time it goes
through the postal system,

30:24.532 --> 30:26.325
you can't really tell who
a thumb belongs to.

30:26.367 --> 30:29.328
Thumb, huh? Could be Salvatore.
He does thumb work.

30:29.370 --> 30:30.955
CONDUCTOR (over P.A.):
This is Clinton-Washington.

30:30.996 --> 30:34.208
Next stop,
Broadway-East New York.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.919
Going to the Rockaways, huh?

30:36.961 --> 30:38.963
Who said that?

30:39.004 --> 30:42.007
Well, there's nowhere else to go
from here but to the Rockaways.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.551
I should know. I grew up there.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.386
You're from the Rockaways?

30:45.427 --> 30:46.845
Yeah, Broad Channel Avenue.

30:46.887 --> 30:49.098
Hey, I'm over on Seagull.

30:49.139 --> 30:50.891
Whoa,
you're in the fancy section.

30:50.933 --> 30:52.810
I don't believe it.
Frank, did you hear?

30:52.851 --> 30:55.020
-A girl from the Rockaways.
-You never meet one of those.

30:55.062 --> 30:57.439
-(chuckles)
-Well, you meet 'em.
They just don't admit it.

30:57.481 --> 30:59.316
Hey, is Greenie's Luncheonette
still there?

30:59.358 --> 31:00.776
Oh, no. We burned it down.

31:00.818 --> 31:02.945
Oh, shame.
They made a great patty melt.

31:02.987 --> 31:05.072
Yeah, yeah, they did at that.

31:05.114 --> 31:07.366
A Rockaways girl. Heh!

31:07.408 --> 31:09.410
(chuckles nervously)

36:47.873 --> 36:49.791
And then it was
completely upended

36:49.833 --> 36:51.793
when my husband had an affair.

36:51.835 --> 36:54.630
(speaking French)

36:54.671 --> 36:56.506
-He cheated on me.
-(speaking French)

36:57.925 --> 36:59.384
-That's a bad thing.
-(speaking French)

37:01.011 --> 37:03.221
Who here has ever
been attacked in public

37:03.263 --> 37:04.848
by their husband's secretary?

37:04.890 --> 37:08.268
(speaking French)

37:08.310 --> 37:09.853
Oh.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.563
Right. It's France.

37:11.605 --> 37:14.149
Back in America,
that line gets bupkis.

37:14.191 --> 37:16.985
Anyhow, my-my husband's cheating
started a chain of events

37:17.027 --> 37:19.821
that led to me spontaneously
getting up on stage

37:19.863 --> 37:21.198
and telling complete strangers,

37:21.239 --> 37:23.659
some of whom don't even
speak my language,

37:23.700 --> 37:25.911
all about my humiliating life.

37:25.953 --> 37:27.537
And the more I did it,

37:27.579 --> 37:29.039
the more I could not
stop doing it,

37:29.081 --> 37:30.207
and the next thing I knew,

37:30.248 --> 37:31.500
twice a week
I'm saying "fuck" onstage.

37:31.541 --> 37:34.503
-(continues speaking French)
-(laughter)

37:34.544 --> 37:36.129
Damn it, your waist is small.

37:36.171 --> 37:38.131
-(Lillian speaking French)
-It's smaller than mine.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.675
Can you just turn the other way?

37:39.716 --> 37:42.052
Seriously, your lipstick
is killing me.

37:42.094 --> 37:45.639
-(laughter)
-Well, that was a mistake.

37:45.681 --> 37:48.642
Your ass is better
than your tits.

37:48.684 --> 37:50.352
(speaking French)

37:50.394 --> 37:53.689
-(laughter)
-Okay.

37:53.730 --> 37:55.732
Is it, is it really necessary
to be that beautiful?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.234
(speaking French)

37:57.275 --> 37:59.987
Because frankly,
it's incredibly unfair.

38:00.028 --> 38:02.406
It's not enough that women have
to compete with other women,

38:02.447 --> 38:04.741
now men are getting in the mix?

38:04.783 --> 38:06.785
(laughter)

38:06.827 --> 38:08.412
You can't have it all.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.247
(speaking French)

38:10.288 --> 38:13.583
You can't run the world and have
all the pretty underwear, too.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.419
(speaking French)

38:15.460 --> 38:17.254
(laughter)

38:17.295 --> 38:18.922
The competition wasn't
stiff enough with the hoards

38:18.964 --> 38:20.674
of slutty secretaries
roaming the Earth?

38:20.716 --> 38:22.509
-(speaking French)
-(laughter)

38:22.551 --> 38:24.177
That's like y-you're already
fighting with some asshole

38:24.219 --> 38:25.929
who's trying to get
in front of you in line

38:25.971 --> 38:27.431
and steal your cab at Bendel's

38:27.472 --> 38:29.099
while you got one arm
full of shopping bags

38:29.141 --> 38:30.726
and the other's
holding onto your son

38:30.767 --> 38:32.436
so he doesn't run away
and drink from the puddles,

38:32.477 --> 38:34.104
and then out of the blue
a mugger comes along

38:34.146 --> 38:35.897
and hits you over the head
with a piece of pipe

38:35.939 --> 38:39.526
he found at a construction site
and completely knocks you out!

38:39.568 --> 38:42.029
(laughter)

38:45.282 --> 38:47.075
See? You see, right?

38:47.117 --> 38:49.494
-It's fun to be up here.
-Whew.

38:49.536 --> 38:52.164
-The-the laughter...
-(speaking French)

38:52.205 --> 38:55.625
...the adoration,

38:55.667 --> 38:59.129
the power of the microphone.

38:59.171 --> 39:02.299
It's intoxicating.
Dangerous, too.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.508
(speaking French)

39:03.550 --> 39:05.218
You remember
my cheating husband?

39:05.260 --> 39:06.803
(speaking French)

39:06.845 --> 39:09.598
-Or as you'd say, "husband"?
-(speaking French)

39:09.639 --> 39:11.183
-(laughter)
-After his affair...

39:11.224 --> 39:13.018
(speaking French)

39:13.060 --> 39:14.269
...or as you'd say, "Thursday."

39:14.311 --> 39:16.271
-(speaking French)
-(laughter)

39:16.313 --> 39:18.607
-He came back.
-(speaking French)

39:18.648 --> 39:21.109
And it seemed like
maybe we could

39:21.151 --> 39:24.488
put the whole sordid affair
behind us, you know,

39:24.529 --> 39:28.909
be French, and then one night...

39:28.950 --> 39:30.368
(laughter)

39:30.410 --> 39:32.579
MIDGE: You've been a great
audience, ladies and gentlemen.

39:32.621 --> 39:35.499
That's it for me.
My name is Mrs. Maisel.

39:35.540 --> 39:39.169
-Thank you and goodnight!
-(cheers and applause)

39:42.798 --> 39:44.216
It worked!

39:44.257 --> 39:46.927
They loved it! That was great!
Wasn't I great?

39:46.968 --> 39:49.513
My God, the arrogance.
I've created a monster.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.431
You're Norman Mailer
in a cocktail dress.

39:51.473 --> 39:53.642
Okay, fine, I'm sorry.
Just tell me, was it good?

39:53.683 --> 39:55.811
Come on, you don't need me
to say it, do you?

39:55.852 --> 39:57.020
Okay, you're up.

39:57.062 --> 39:59.064
I'm not going on after that.
Are you kidding me?

39:59.106 --> 40:01.650
-You afraid to follow a girl?
-Always and everywhere.

40:01.691 --> 40:03.318
JACKIE:
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

40:03.360 --> 40:04.903
the reason why
we're here tonight,

40:04.945 --> 40:08.573
-I give you, Lenny Bruce!
-(cheers and applause)

40:21.211 --> 40:24.464
Will Elizabeth Taylor
become Bar Mitzvah'ed?

40:24.506 --> 40:26.216
(laughter)

40:26.258 --> 40:28.844
No, I promise continuity,
I'll behave myself.

40:28.885 --> 40:30.679
I'll do all the lines
that we rehearsed.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.931
That's the thing, you know,

40:32.973 --> 40:35.350
I have a, uh, reputation

40:35.392 --> 40:39.396
for being sort of controversial
and irreverent

40:39.437 --> 40:43.191
and-and also the semantic
bear trap of bad taste.

40:43.233 --> 40:44.901
And actually I do have

40:44.943 --> 40:47.946
and-and always will be
accused of bad taste

40:47.988 --> 40:50.657
by the people
who eat in restaurants

40:50.699 --> 40:53.034
to reserve service,

40:53.076 --> 40:55.120
-you know, that kind of scene.
-(laughter)

40:55.162 --> 40:57.539
Yeah. But you
might be interested

40:57.581 --> 41:01.209
in how I became offensive.

41:01.251 --> 41:03.211
Like, it started in school,

41:03.253 --> 41:05.922
uh, with, um... drinking,

41:05.964 --> 41:07.674
and, uh, I was...

41:07.716 --> 41:11.136
Really, I was, like, this
real depressed kid, you know.

41:11.178 --> 41:13.722
And, uh,
seven or eight years old,

41:13.763 --> 41:16.016
and I'd get really juiced

41:16.057 --> 41:17.767
and out of my head, and...

41:17.809 --> 41:21.897
Yeah, yeah, so the teacher would
really get bummed, you know,

41:21.938 --> 41:25.650
with me singing and carrying on

41:25.692 --> 41:27.360
and calling Columbus a fink,

41:27.402 --> 41:29.571
-(laughter)
-and-and boosting Aaron Burr,

41:29.613 --> 41:31.031
and then smoking.

41:31.072 --> 41:33.241
See, I don't know
if you can see this,

41:33.283 --> 41:35.619
but I have this tattoo.
Can you see that?

41:35.660 --> 41:38.788
-Aah! Did you see?
-Yeah. You were amazing.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.165
I was amazing.

41:40.207 --> 41:41.833
What's the matter?

41:41.875 --> 41:44.419
Nothing. Just a funny story.

41:44.461 --> 41:47.172
While you were up there,
Joel came in.

41:47.214 --> 41:49.674
-What?
-Yeah. He was here and he saw...

41:49.716 --> 41:51.218
How much did he hear?

41:51.259 --> 41:53.428
-I don't know.
-How much?

41:53.470 --> 41:55.138
Well... all of it.

41:55.180 --> 41:56.514
Oh, God. Oh, God.

41:56.556 --> 41:58.433
Did he, did he seem upset?

41:58.475 --> 42:00.602
A little.
He said some things.

42:00.644 --> 42:02.687
-You talked to him?
-For a second.

42:02.729 --> 42:03.730
What-what did he say?

42:03.772 --> 42:05.523
That he was upset.

42:05.565 --> 42:07.776
-What did you say?
-I said you were a great comic,

42:07.817 --> 42:09.402
and you were gonna be a star.

42:09.444 --> 42:10.987
And I might have called him
Sal Mineo.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.489
Which I would like to point out

42:12.530 --> 42:14.157
that many people
would take as a compliment.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.450
Shit. Shit, shit...

42:15.492 --> 42:17.369
Miriam, where are you going?

42:17.410 --> 42:19.496
(laughter)

42:28.755 --> 42:31.258
(panting)

42:31.299 --> 42:34.177
I didn't know you
were gonna be there.

42:35.762 --> 42:38.556
And what would you have done
if you did know?

42:41.101 --> 42:43.270
I'm sorry.

42:44.312 --> 42:46.022
For what?

42:47.691 --> 42:50.610
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

43:36.573 --> 43:38.950
I should probably
get off the stage now.

43:38.992 --> 43:40.577
Uh...
(sniffles)

43:40.618 --> 43:42.579
Thank you for listening.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.998
My name is Mrs. Maisel.

43:45.040 --> 43:46.833
That's my stage name.

43:46.875 --> 43:48.835
I-I gave it to myself
when I thought

43:48.877 --> 43:50.628
I was actually gonna be
Mrs. Maisel,

43:50.670 --> 43:54.049
and then after it just seemed
darkly ironic, so...

43:54.090 --> 43:55.925
I kept it.

43:57.427 --> 44:00.221
(quietly):
So...

44:00.263 --> 44:01.890
bye.

44:04.392 --> 44:06.394
-(Midge sniffles)
-(woman coughs)

44:12.317 --> 44:14.611
Here's the card
of a psychiatrist

44:14.652 --> 44:16.613
who just moved to New York
from Boston.

44:16.654 --> 44:19.616
He's done wonders
for my friend Sylvia Plath.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.659
Call him.

44:21.701 --> 44:23.203
Thanks.

I just can't understand

44:39.094 --> 44:40.678
what goes on
in that head of yours!

44:40.720 --> 44:42.472
It's like a panoply

He's not in the business.

-SHIRLEY: He's smart.
Explain it.

44:47.143 --> 44:48.603
MOISHE:
No, I don't want to explain it.

44:48.645 --> 44:50.313
He chose to keep
his life separate,

44:50.355 --> 44:51.523
so, goddamm it,
keep it separate!

45:16.506 --> 45:17.674

45:17.715 --> 45:20.051
I can't believe
you shot a clown.

45:20.093 --> 45:23.179
His flower-- whoa--
started spewing water

45:23.221 --> 45:24.472
all over the place.

45:24.514 --> 45:27.100
Colored scarves were
shooting out of his mouth.

45:27.142 --> 45:30.311
People were killing themselves
to get out of that Volkswagen.

45:30.353 --> 45:31.980
It was great.

45:32.021 --> 45:34.274
I have to tell you, Saverina,
this food is amazing.

45:34.315 --> 45:35.608
I never had moussaka before.

45:35.650 --> 45:37.318
Wouldn't you know
I go out of my way

45:37.360 --> 45:40.447
to marry a Sicilian girl,
and all she cooks is Greek.

45:40.488 --> 45:41.990
(chuckles)
Hey, Sophia,

45:42.031 --> 45:43.450
you find that quarter I hid yet?

45:43.491 --> 45:44.701
No.

45:44.742 --> 45:46.578
Oh, you don't find it
by the time I finish,

45:46.619 --> 45:47.745
I'm taking it back.

45:47.787 --> 45:49.706
SOPHIA:
No, no, no, no, no!

45:49.747 --> 45:50.832
Cute kid.

45:50.874 --> 45:52.500
-Thanks.
-So, Susie,

45:52.542 --> 45:54.502
we've been talking,
and if you want us

45:54.544 --> 45:56.880
to do a little digging
about your uncle,

45:56.921 --> 46:00.300
we know where they, you know,
do a little digging,

46:00.341 --> 46:01.593
if you get my drift.

46:01.634 --> 46:03.887
Wow, that is a really
sweet offer,

46:03.928 --> 46:05.722
but no one really misses him.

46:05.763 --> 46:06.931
Thanks, though.

46:08.141 --> 46:10.852
Mmm... this is better
than the moussaka.

46:10.894 --> 46:13.021
Seriously, Saverina,
you are a genius.

46:13.062 --> 46:15.231
Wait till you taste her dessert.

46:15.273 --> 46:17.108
You know what, this is the best
abduction I've ever had.

46:17.150 --> 46:18.401
I'm serious here.

46:18.443 --> 46:19.611
Hey, our pleasure.

46:19.652 --> 46:21.571
God, it's so good.

46:23.656 --> 46:26.201
SUSIE:
Ah, shit! Almost.

46:26.242 --> 46:28.077
I'll tell you one thing,
you don't throw like a girl.

46:28.119 --> 46:29.913
Okay, okay, okay. Ha!

46:29.954 --> 46:31.539
-(glass shatters)
-SUSIE: Asshole.

46:31.581 --> 46:33.124
Every time.
He hits it every time.

46:33.166 --> 46:34.959
I roughed up
a Major League pitcher once.

46:35.001 --> 46:36.836
Yeah, what, so you got
his abilities through osmosis?

46:36.878 --> 46:39.214
No, but he gave me some tips
before I broke his arm.

46:39.255 --> 46:41.299
Okay, here goes nothing.

46:41.341 --> 46:43.259
-(water splashes)
-I'm fighting the wind.

46:43.301 --> 46:45.178
-Oh, come on.
-What?
-There was a gust of wind

46:45.220 --> 46:46.804
that came right as
I started to throw.

46:46.846 --> 46:48.973
The only wind out here is coming
out of your ass, pal.

46:49.015 --> 46:51.643
-I win. Five bucks. Pay up.
-I don't have any money.

46:51.684 --> 46:53.645
Guess you're just gonna
have to kill me.

46:53.686 --> 46:55.730
(laughter)

46:55.772 --> 46:58.358
Speaking of killing me,
it's getting pretty late here.

46:58.399 --> 47:00.735
Okay, come on.
Let's get you home.

47:00.777 --> 47:04.614
Oh, hey,
a little business first.

47:04.656 --> 47:06.741
You skated here tonight, Susie.

47:06.783 --> 47:08.868
You're from the neighborhood,
we like you,

47:08.910 --> 47:10.954
my family likes you,
so we're gonna just

47:10.995 --> 47:12.455
tell our boss
we couldn't find you.

47:12.497 --> 47:13.831
I appreciate that, Frank.

47:13.873 --> 47:15.750
But this problem
isn't going away,

47:15.792 --> 47:17.377
and next time they could
send some other guys.

47:17.418 --> 47:20.171
Guys who don't have a problem
roughing up a girl.

47:20.213 --> 47:21.756
They could send Tony.

47:21.798 --> 47:24.551
Tony beat the shit
out of Martha Raye last week.

47:24.592 --> 47:26.386
Had a steak dinner
at Keens after.

47:26.427 --> 47:28.179
-Yeah, I get it.
-It would be good if you could

47:28.221 --> 47:29.347
find a way
to resolve this problem

47:29.389 --> 47:31.266
before that happens, okay?

47:31.307 --> 47:33.351
Now, come on.

47:33.393 --> 47:35.937
Saverina made you
a fuckin' doggie bag.

-Okay.

-Hello?
-MIDGE: Joel?

48:31.826 --> 48:34.245
Midge? What's the matter?

48:34.287 --> 48:36.205
So, this is how it's gonna be
from now on?

48:36.247 --> 48:37.915
I call, and it's,
"Midge, what's the matter?"

48:37.957 --> 48:42.879
No. No, but...
what's the matter?

48:42.920 --> 48:45.256
You won't leave a number.
You won't talk to me.

48:45.298 --> 48:47.717
I-I can't find you.
I don't know where you are.

48:47.759 --> 48:48.760
I'm at my parents'.

48:48.801 --> 48:49.927
No, I know you're
at your parents'.

48:49.969 --> 48:51.596
-Then you know where I am.
-I don't-- I don't mean

48:51.638 --> 48:53.306
I want to know where you are,
I mean I want to know

48:53.348 --> 48:56.059
where you are;
I want to talk.

48:56.100 --> 48:58.436
I think it would be better to
have a little space right now.

48:58.478 --> 49:01.356
-Why? Why?!
-Midge, you know why.

49:01.397 --> 49:04.067
No. It was,
it was just that night.

49:04.108 --> 49:05.652
That night screwed
everything up.

49:05.693 --> 49:07.236
Hey, what's going on
with you tonight?

49:07.278 --> 49:08.488
Where's this coming from?

49:08.529 --> 49:10.114
It's coming from me.

49:10.156 --> 49:12.617
It's coming from
that fucking bridge.

49:12.659 --> 49:14.869
-What bridge?
-(sirens wailing in background)

49:14.911 --> 49:16.204
I hear sirens.

49:16.245 --> 49:17.497
That's not New York.
Where are you?

49:17.538 --> 49:18.706
-France.
-What?!

49:18.748 --> 49:20.375
I want to talk about our future.

49:20.416 --> 49:22.627
-Did you say France?
-Because I really think
we can work this out.

49:22.669 --> 49:23.961
(sighs)
Midge...

49:24.003 --> 49:25.296
-We have children.
-Yes.

49:25.338 --> 49:26.673
We will have to
see each other forever.

49:26.714 --> 49:28.007
-Yes.
-Until we are dead.

49:28.049 --> 49:29.926
-Yes.
-And then for four
to six months after.

49:29.967 --> 49:31.928
Okay, apparently you know
something I don't.

49:31.969 --> 49:34.138
So we are never gonna be
fully out of each other's lives.

49:34.180 --> 49:36.265
-I know that.
-So, if we can't ever leave,

49:36.307 --> 49:37.725
then let's figure out
how to stay.

49:37.767 --> 49:39.977
-Midge, come on.
-We were on a path.

49:40.019 --> 49:42.355
We were heading somewhere.
We were almost there.

49:42.397 --> 49:44.607
-I know.
-It was just that night
at the club.

49:44.649 --> 49:46.901
That's it. I-If that
hadn't have happened...

49:46.943 --> 49:50.613
-It happened.
-But... I don't understand.

49:50.655 --> 49:52.490
I don't understand why
we can't work it out.

49:52.532 --> 49:53.741
There has to be a way.

49:53.783 --> 49:56.160
-There's not.
-Don't say that.

49:56.202 --> 49:57.829
I love you, Joel.

49:57.870 --> 49:59.956
I love you, too.

49:59.997 --> 50:03.918
I am in love with you.
So deeply in love with you.

50:03.960 --> 50:06.462
-You're killing me, Midge.
-We can do this.

50:06.504 --> 50:08.423
We can figure this out.
I can figure this out.

50:08.464 --> 50:10.133
I can figure anything out.
I am amazing.

50:10.174 --> 50:12.135
I know you are, you don't have
to tell me any of this.

50:12.176 --> 50:16.180
So then, why? Why?
Tell me why.

50:16.222 --> 50:18.975
Because for us to be together,
you'd have to give it up.

50:19.016 --> 50:21.769
What? Stand-up?

50:21.811 --> 50:23.563
I can't be in a marriage
where my wife is going off

50:23.604 --> 50:25.606
and talking about me
to a room full of strangers.

50:25.648 --> 50:28.776
Talking about my faults,
my mistakes, my failures.

50:28.818 --> 50:30.236
Y-You don't understand,
the whole point is

50:30.278 --> 50:31.946
you go off
and talk about your life.

50:31.988 --> 50:34.782
No, no, no, I do understand.
I understand completely.

50:34.824 --> 50:36.993
I know you have to talk
about your life.

50:37.034 --> 50:40.079
That's why you're good,
'cause you're honest.

50:40.121 --> 50:42.498
It's real, it's authentic.

50:42.540 --> 50:44.250
It's everything
I wasn't up there.

50:44.292 --> 50:48.838
I get it.
I just can't live with it.

50:48.880 --> 50:51.507
I wish I could.
Maybe another man could,

50:51.549 --> 50:54.260
but I just can't be a joke.

50:54.302 --> 50:56.888
You are not a joke.

50:56.929 --> 50:59.015
Do you want to quit?

51:02.226 --> 51:03.686
No.

51:03.728 --> 51:07.231
I don't want you to quit either.

51:07.273 --> 51:09.484
You're too good.

51:09.525 --> 51:13.362
So... you see where
I'm going here?

51:13.404 --> 51:15.573
Follow me down the road.
If you're not gonna stop,

51:15.615 --> 51:17.033
I can't be there for it.

51:21.412 --> 51:25.500
Now... why are you in France?

51:25.541 --> 51:27.627
Long story.

51:27.668 --> 51:30.421
I'd like to hear it sometime.

51:30.463 --> 51:33.883
I love you.

51:35.384 --> 51:37.762
I love you, too, honey.

51:42.058 --> 51:44.143
And you're gonna be okay.
