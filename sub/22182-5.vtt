WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:03.771
You're the first Special
Ops chick I ever met.

00:03.804 --> 00:07.041
How do you control yourself
around so many hot, sweaty men?

00:07.075 --> 00:10.211
Only hard part's the smell, sir.
(laughter)

00:10.244 --> 00:12.680
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
They have the package.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.649
(screams)

00:18.252 --> 00:22.490
GALLO:
His name is Davis Goundry.
Killed in action in 2014.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.392
They told us we were targeting
a Somali national that night.

00:24.425 --> 00:25.726
Instead we get
an American soldier.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.295
Move! Or I will shoot
through you.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.662
MADANI:
Why would Richard
want him dead?

00:31.165 --> 00:32.433
We lied in our debriefs.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.135
We made that decision together.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.569
HASKINS:
Jimmy Kam's been captured

00:35.603 --> 00:36.770
along with Sergeant Hendrix.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.073
My name is Khalid Samatar.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.175
I'm the man who has
your soldiers.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.776
His brother is who he
really cares about.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.745
My guess, he would
take that deal.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.180
The prisoner exchange is a go.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.149
Let's get our boys back.
Hooah!

00:48.182 --> 00:49.850
GALLO:
If all goes well,
36 hours from now

00:49.883 --> 00:52.186
we'll have Jimmy back.
MADANI: It will go well.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.188
(groans)
We got a problem back here.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.223
The prisoner seems
to be convulsing.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.757
What's happening back there?

00:56.790 --> 00:58.092
It's pretty bad.
I think he's dead.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.568
MADANI:
Are you sure he's dead?

01:07.601 --> 01:09.203
COOGAN:
He seems pretty
friggin' gone, ma'am.

01:09.237 --> 01:11.205
THEA:
There's no pulse.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.174
GALLO: Maybe you can get his
heart started again.
DARZI: Try CPR.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.109
THEA: And there should be
a steroid shot in the med kit.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.710
DARZI: And one and two
and three and four

01:16.744 --> 01:19.247
and ten, and one...
He's not breathing.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.748
The med kit is not designed
for a heart attack.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.150
If his brother's dead,
there's no way Khalid

01:22.183 --> 01:23.083
goes through with the
prisoner exchange.

01:23.117 --> 01:25.286
We're fully aware, Ms. Madani.
And four.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.720
We lost him.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.589
COOGAN:
Mustaf's dead.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.295
GALLO:
Anchor Zero-Six.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.297
We got a problem up here.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.532
MADANI (on radio):
Sir, we need to abort

01:38.566 --> 01:40.568
and then try and make
a new deal with Khalid.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.803
We've never been
this close to getting our guys.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.306
We know Khalid's negotiator
will be at the meeting spot.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.374
That is worth a lot.

01:46.407 --> 01:49.277
How much time
until the exchange?

01:49.310 --> 01:50.544
We got three hours.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.646
That's just enough time
to get there. No time

01:52.680 --> 01:53.814
to stop and regroup.
We're gonna have to
solve this in the air.

01:53.847 --> 01:58.118
If Khalid finds out his brother
is dead, those POWs...

02:00.421 --> 02:01.722
Renegade One-Two.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.824
Renegade One-Two.
Do not,

02:03.857 --> 02:05.293
I repeat, do not abort.

02:05.326 --> 02:06.527
Proceed to the airstrip.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.296
And then do what, sir?

02:08.329 --> 02:10.231
We'll work on that.
Stand by for an update.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.234
THEA:
This is insane.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.236
I need to call Magnus.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.171
Who's Magnus?

02:17.205 --> 02:19.507
Director of CIA
Special Activities.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.176
My boss, Darzi.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.677
He's good with these kinds
of situations.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.213
Disasters, you mean?

02:25.246 --> 02:27.881
No. Crazy-ass solutions.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.750
Two years ago, we did an exfil
in Kazakhstan,

02:29.783 --> 02:32.320
the guy got us, and the asset,
out safely.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.255
Operators call him
"The Resuscitator."

02:34.288 --> 02:37.157
Because he saves operations
that go sideways.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.362
Something tells me
this qualifies.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.266
*

02:51.239 --> 02:54.708
Right this way, Director.
The colonel is expecting you.

02:54.742 --> 02:55.909
Outstanding.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.278
You got lucky.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.447
I was on a golf weekend
in Atlanta.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.915
Think I hit nearly every
sand trap on the course.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.817
We have been running some
contingency scenarios

03:03.851 --> 03:05.353
while you were en route.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.320
We think that the best...

03:06.354 --> 03:08.389
Not concerned with those.

03:08.422 --> 03:11.592
Sir, our team is only two
hours from the airstrip.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.927
I know. I've got
my own briefers.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.764
Don't need a backgrounder
from some kid born on third

03:16.797 --> 03:19.267
thinkin' he hit
a triple, Porter.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.472
I can assure you
that my mother

03:24.505 --> 03:26.340
has nothing to do
with my role here.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.276
I am absolutely sure
you believe that.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.945
And you know that saying about
workhorses and show horses,

03:31.979 --> 03:33.314
right?

03:33.347 --> 03:34.515
I wonder which one you are.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.318
Gentlemen.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.454
Director, welcome.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.323
Colonel Haskins, it is
an honor to meet you, sir.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.624
I've always wanted to
work with your unit.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.459
All right. Well, let me
bring you up to speed.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.860
Oh, I'm pretty clear.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.629
The prisoner is no
longer breathing,

03:48.662 --> 03:50.864
so we've got a little bit of
a situation on our hands.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.533
That's all right. We'll
whip it into shape.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.903
But for this to work, I need
us to be absolutely clear:

03:55.936 --> 03:57.738
Those aviators
are all yours.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.374
I'm in command of the ground
operators from here on out.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.310
Well, we've drawn up a number
of possible plans.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.812
I'm leaning toward the capture
and interrogate maneuver.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.780
Value to that,
but I hate people.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.782
Too many headaches.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.551
That negotiator's our only lead

04:10.584 --> 04:12.553
to finding Sergeants Kam
and Hendrix.
Exactly.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.455
That's why we need him to make
the proof-of-life call for us.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.824
FaceTime, that's what
we agreed on, isn't it?
Yes.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.059
Well, then we just need to get
the negotiator's phone.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.562
NSA triangulates the call,
then we know where to find them.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.831
No headaches at all.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.499
But how are we gonna do
our proof-of-life call

04:25.533 --> 04:27.000
when the guy isn't alive?

04:27.034 --> 04:28.902
Oh, we just play a
little "show me yours

04:28.936 --> 04:30.804
before I show you mine."

04:32.640 --> 04:34.675
There are still some moving
pieces to work out.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.411
Let's get started.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.596
You all right, Madani?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.998
Clear headed?

04:59.367 --> 05:01.369
Don't worry, it's just us
on this channel.

05:01.402 --> 05:05.839
I told you, I have a
prescription for those pills.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.107
And I told you, no way

05:07.140 --> 05:08.576
you should be taking those
in the cockpit.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.479
I got us through the fog,
didn't I?

05:11.512 --> 05:12.580
I'm flying fine.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.114
That's not the point.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.016
You don't pop pills
in my helo,

05:16.049 --> 05:17.685
or in my unit.

05:17.718 --> 05:20.087
We're gonna talk long
and hard about this,

05:20.120 --> 05:21.755
as soon as this
mission's done.

05:21.789 --> 05:25.926
And until then, you make sure
no one else sees that bottle.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.362
This day's enough of a
Charlie-Foxtrot as is.

05:28.396 --> 05:32.132
Yes, sir.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.535
How long do you think they'll
have us flying without a plan?

05:34.568 --> 05:36.437
Command's still
working on it.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.439
In the meantime,
we gotta stay fluid.

05:38.472 --> 05:39.973
Trust our guts.
(chuckles)

05:40.974 --> 05:42.510
What?

05:42.543 --> 05:45.479
I just...

05:45.513 --> 05:47.581
I'm just not sure
my gut's worth trusting.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.983
Last time I did, it
was the wrong choice.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.485
You mean Goundry?

05:51.519 --> 05:52.219
If he'd flipped sides,

05:52.252 --> 05:53.621
if he was working
with Khalid,

05:53.654 --> 05:55.456
then we shouldn't
have saved him.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.390
We should've been
helping Richard.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.058
That's still a real big if.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.827
It would answer a lot of
questions, wouldn't it?

06:01.562 --> 06:03.564
Okay.

06:03.597 --> 06:04.865
Let's just finish this mission,

06:04.898 --> 06:06.500
get our guys.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.402
We'll handle all the
other suck stateside.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.504
HASKINS:
Renegade One-Two,
Renegade One-Two.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.507
This is Anchor Zero-Six.
We have a plan.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.576
We have a friend from Langley
here with us.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.977
We're gonna walk you
through the new op.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.712
Good evening, Renegade Elements.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.482
It's always a pleasure to be
working with the best.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.817
The plan here is simple.
You will follow through

06:23.851 --> 06:27.087
on the prisoner exchange,
with one slight twist.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.557
We're all aware the prisoner
is still dead, right?

06:29.590 --> 06:31.659
HASKINS:
Renegade One-Two, time
is of the essence here.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.761
Roger that, sir.
Just trying to keep it loose.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.863
Tighten it up.
Since Khalid's brother Mustaf

06:35.896 --> 06:37.698
is indeed no longer with us,

06:37.731 --> 06:39.567
one of you will need
to impersonate him

06:39.600 --> 06:41.769
at the exchange.
Put on his clothes,

06:41.802 --> 06:44.438
get black-bagged to conceal your
identity from the negotiator.

06:44.472 --> 06:47.608
Now, the deal is that we swap
proof-of-life videos first,

06:47.641 --> 06:49.610
then deliver the prisoners
at a separate location.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.745
Khalid's negotiator's
gonna be surprised

06:51.779 --> 06:53.481
that we brought the brother
to the airstrip.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.414
We're gonna use this

06:54.448 --> 06:56.850
to get him on tilt,
then incentivize him

06:56.884 --> 06:59.487
to verify proof of life first.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.688
That's mission critical.

07:00.721 --> 07:03.023
The negotiator demanded
one Black Hawk only

07:03.056 --> 07:04.925
at the exchange, engines off.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.527
The other helos will drop their

07:06.560 --> 07:08.929
Delta Force operators
one klick away.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.998
They will move on foot
to the airstrip.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.534
Meantime, get the negotiator
to make that video call.

07:13.567 --> 07:17.137
As soon as he does,
our Delta Team will break cover

07:17.170 --> 07:19.139
and will apprehend the
negotiator to secure that phone.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.542
That's the key to finding Kam
and Hendrix's location.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.644
What are our, uh,
rules of engagement?

07:23.677 --> 07:25.679
Nothing but flash bangs, unless
they threaten deadly force.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.615
MADANI:
Since he's dead,

07:27.648 --> 07:29.182
who's going to play the brother?

07:29.216 --> 07:30.884
Since we only get one helo
at the airstrip,

07:30.918 --> 07:32.520
it's got to be somebody
on your bird.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.955
Mustaf is six-foot, 190.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.691
Gallo, Ramirez,

07:37.725 --> 07:39.893
you're the only ones
who fit the description.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.663
Let us know what you decide.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.834
I'm fully aware this is
unorthodox.

07:46.867 --> 07:50.738
But on Khalid's timeline
it's what we've got.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.640
All right, here's the deal.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.975
Ramirez, since you're gonna be
in the jumpsuit, Bautista,

07:55.008 --> 07:56.710
I want you on the hand...
That won't be necessary.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.912
I'm gonna play
the dead brother.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.614
Sir, personally, I would feel
more comfortable

08:00.648 --> 08:01.615
with a ground operator
out there.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.916
Ramirez is the best shot
we have.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.952
Why take away his rifle
and put a bag over his head?

08:04.985 --> 08:06.554
It needs to be Ramirez.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.255
We have two pilots
for a reason.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.624
That's a redundancy. Besides,
we'll be on the ground

08:10.658 --> 08:12.059
when I'm doing it.
Look, if Madani's even
agreeing with me,

08:12.092 --> 08:14.595
I think you know I'm right.
Not to mention, Ramirez

08:14.628 --> 08:16.930
has training in
close combat; you don't.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.299
This isn't a debate.
We need shooters at the ready.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.301
I'm getting under that hood.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.070
Hey.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.005
Do you want to step in here?

08:25.038 --> 08:27.575
The man left it up
to Gallo and Ramirez.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.943
If Mission Control doesn't care,
then neither do I.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.645
GALLO:
Good. Then we're done here.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.547
Renegade One-Two.
Decision's made.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.048
I'll play the brother.

08:54.134 --> 08:57.671
Negotiator's six mikes out,
people. Let's get into position.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.787
(phone rings)

09:13.821 --> 09:15.623
What is it?

09:15.656 --> 09:18.058
Due respect, sir,

09:18.091 --> 09:20.193
but this plan could go wrong
in so many ways.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.631
I am trusting you
to make sure that it doesn't.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.866
After completely icing me
out of the planning process.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.235
I know this is your first time
in the field.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.970
I'm here to clean up
your mess, Thea.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.772
That's why you called me.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.207
I need you to execute this plan
and get that phone

09:34.241 --> 09:35.776
by whatever means necessary.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.079
Yes, sir.
I'll get it done.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.048
And you're clear
on the secondary objective?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.650
We have every reason to believe
Khalid stored it

09:42.683 --> 09:43.951
wherever the prisoners are.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.319
Yes, sir. I have the equipment
to secure it.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.256
Outstanding.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.777
Coogan's right, you know.
Makes no sense, you doing this.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.179
Decision's made.
Okay. Just help me
understand why.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.716
We'll add it to our
stateside suck list.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.718
Are you trying
to prove something?

10:17.751 --> 10:19.987
I'm trying to set something
right... for Jimmy.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.355
It's not your fault
he was captured.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.657
It's no one's fault.

10:23.691 --> 10:26.093
I let him down before.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.262
Today, I finally have a chance
to make that right.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.798
I'm taking it.

10:30.831 --> 10:34.034
THEA: Khalid's negotiator's
half a klick out, people!

10:34.067 --> 10:36.704
Let's move!
(exhales)

10:40.173 --> 10:41.775
I need you to take these.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.677
Anything happens
to me out there,

10:43.711 --> 10:45.713
you make sure my mom gets these.

10:45.746 --> 10:46.780
Gallo...

10:46.814 --> 10:48.749
That's an order, Madani.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.021
Yes, sir.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.322
You're flight lead now.

10:56.724 --> 10:57.725
Get back in that pilot's seat.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.935
(exhales)

11:07.968 --> 11:10.170
*

11:37.998 --> 11:40.000
(exhales)

11:46.807 --> 11:49.109
*

11:55.515 --> 11:56.917
(gasping)

11:56.950 --> 11:59.820
Wake up.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.122
Khalid wants you clean
for the camera.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.824
What are you talking about,
Dauud?

12:03.857 --> 12:05.525
What camera?
(sniffs)

12:05.558 --> 12:07.360
Wash your faces.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.229
This is big day.

12:11.298 --> 12:14.868
You should pray to Allah
for his many blessings.

12:16.203 --> 12:19.206
They're gonna do
a proof of life.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.241
(panting)

12:24.411 --> 12:26.413
Thea.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.249
(whistles)

12:29.282 --> 12:31.151
Thea.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.285
You know, you give people
hell all the time.

12:32.319 --> 12:35.455
I mean, you've been giving
me hell since day one. Yeah.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.557
What do you say we go give
these guys some hell together?

12:37.590 --> 12:40.193
I'd say you need to work
on your pep talks.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.330
And here I was, trying
to bury the hatchet.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.265
Let's get you bagged.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.934
And give him
an earpiece.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.536
(grunts)
Here, take that.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.145
(grunts)

13:01.114 --> 13:04.151
Well, now, I'd say
that's an improvement.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.827
The brother had a limp
in his left leg.

13:13.861 --> 13:16.196
Give me a limp, Captain.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.433
(panting)

13:23.336 --> 13:26.339
JIMMY: That's the chip
indicator, and right behind it

13:26.373 --> 13:28.308
is the oil level
sight glass.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.310
And that's the tail rotor
gearbox, right?

13:30.343 --> 13:32.312
Yes, ma'am. That can be
a real pain in the ass.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.914
Sir.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.985
Now, I always keep spare
electric tape in my flight bag.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.220
You'd be surprised
how dollar store tape

13:40.253 --> 13:42.355
can solve
million-dollar problems.
(chuckles)

13:42.389 --> 13:45.292
You know, most pilots
aren't interested

13:45.325 --> 13:48.896
in how the helos work,
just how fast they go.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.398
Yeah, it's a good point.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.601
But can she go any faster?

13:54.634 --> 13:56.303
Sorry I'm interrupting
your weekly

13:56.336 --> 13:57.504
technical talks.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.239
Heard you were looking for me,
Sergeant.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.373
Good evening, sir.

14:00.407 --> 14:04.477
I will see you two
bright and early.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.447
Good night, sir.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.082
Dismissed.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.918
(sniffs, grunts)

14:10.951 --> 14:13.987
Did you, uh, get a chance to
review the mission brief, sir?

14:14.021 --> 14:15.455
Read it twice.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.290
It's kind of my job.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.292
It's a little light
on details, wouldn't you say?

14:19.326 --> 14:21.594
Yeah. CIA's always sparse
with specifics.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.997
No, no. Not like this.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.399
We have zero intel
on this Somali prisoner.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.235
Zero.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.904
You telling me
that's not a first?

14:30.938 --> 14:32.639
I don't feel good
about this one.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.541
Look, if you have a problem,
Sergeant,

14:34.574 --> 14:37.077
you should've brought that up to
Officer Richard in the briefing.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.912
Well, you're the flight lead.
It's... (chuckles)

14:38.946 --> 14:40.547
kind of your job.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.449
If I have a problem,
you have a problem, right?

14:42.482 --> 14:45.919
It's just nerves, man.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.620
All right?

14:47.654 --> 14:50.423
Look, you want

14:50.457 --> 14:53.093
to grab a beer, catch
a ball game, I'm all in.

14:53.126 --> 14:56.096
But... you need to talk
about your feelings,

14:56.129 --> 14:57.197
go to Jess.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.167
Or I can sub you out.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.939
I'll see you tomorrow at 06.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.576
All right.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.579
(panting)

15:22.522 --> 15:24.557
Stay there.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.226
(speaks Arabic)

15:26.259 --> 15:28.695
(speaks Arabic)

15:28.728 --> 15:31.431
English is okay.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.266
Uh, you brought
Khalid's brother here?

15:33.300 --> 15:35.035
He's not well.
I didn't want to put him

15:35.068 --> 15:36.436
through another flight
after this.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.973
It's my gift to you.

15:40.007 --> 15:42.942
It's a gesture of good faith.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.146
Mm.

15:46.179 --> 15:49.716
Khalid told me to show you this

15:49.749 --> 15:51.718
and to tell you,

15:51.751 --> 15:53.686
if this goes wrong,

15:53.720 --> 15:57.557
there is much, much more
he can do to hurt your country.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.992
A domino.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.693
Is that supposed to mean

16:00.727 --> 16:02.595
something to me?

16:05.698 --> 16:07.667
MAGNUS:
Backup ground operators in place

16:07.700 --> 16:09.236
and ready to converge?

16:09.269 --> 16:11.471
20 yards till position.
So far, so good.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.073
The backup team

16:13.106 --> 16:15.475
is in place.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.609
We are a go.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.245
Bring him over.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.580
My prisoner is right here,
in person.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.349
Yours are God knows where.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.351
You verify first.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.720
Or did I fly all this way
for nothing?

16:34.694 --> 16:37.230
(soft clinking)

16:37.264 --> 16:39.499
(chuckling)

16:54.614 --> 16:58.618
Khalid's guests
are, uh, alive and well.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.657
MAGNUS:
Backup team is standing by.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.593
They'll move as soon
as we've got the proof of life.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.298
You see for yourself.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.641
I believe it is your turn now.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.178
He made the call.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.613
Time for the operators to move.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.215
We need that phone.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.654
Hold tight. We have a problem.
Tango, ten o'clock.
That one of Khalid's guys?

17:34.687 --> 17:37.690
He posted a lookout right
in the operator's path.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.392
We're all looking
at the same monitor, Porter.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.793
CAG OPERATOR:
We have eyes on him, sir.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.229
He hasn't spotted us.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.531
How do we proceed?
HASKINS: Do not proceed.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.166
That lookout sees you,
he calls Khalid--

17:46.199 --> 17:47.700
our guys are as good as dead.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.702
Reposition and take the airstrip
from the south.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.838
Oh, no, that will
take too long.
You got a better idea?

17:53.706 --> 17:55.708
Backup team will reposition.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.510
We need more time.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.147
I'd like to see our guys again.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.648
No! La, la, la.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.317
I gave you proof of life.
Now you give mine.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.619
My people are saying that I need
to take a photo of that screen.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.555
I'm not authorized
to do the I.D.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.590
(speaks Arabic)
Then why are you the one here?

18:10.623 --> 18:12.559
U.S. government.
Lot of bureaucracy.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.726
What do you want me to say?

18:14.761 --> 18:17.297
Show me his face now.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.431
I need you to take out
your phone...
No!

18:18.465 --> 18:20.333
This is not what we agreed on!

18:23.270 --> 18:24.471
MADANI:
Weapons are out!

18:24.504 --> 18:26.139
Things are going south!

18:26.173 --> 18:27.574
We can take 'em if we need to.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.609
Targeted and ready to bang-bang.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.645
COOGAN: Yeah, Gallo's
in the way of the target.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.481
If this gets hairy,
he could get clipped.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.482
So he can move.

18:35.515 --> 18:36.716
No. He takes one step,

18:36.749 --> 18:38.551
they're gonna open fire.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.196
(panting)

18:56.936 --> 18:59.239
*

19:12.252 --> 19:15.422
Anchor O-Six,
permission to engage?

19:16.356 --> 19:17.857
MAGNUS: Reaper feed image
isn't giving us

19:17.890 --> 19:20.193
the detail
we need.

19:20.227 --> 19:22.595
Chief Madani has
the clearest view.

19:22.629 --> 19:25.665
She makes the call.

19:28.435 --> 19:29.569
Permission to engage, Madani?

19:36.576 --> 19:38.611
(inhales)

19:39.579 --> 19:41.548
COOGAN:
Captain Gallo,

19:41.581 --> 19:44.584
what the hell are you doing?

19:47.254 --> 19:50.223
(panting)

19:50.257 --> 19:51.258
Cover me.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.395
Engage!

20:08.341 --> 20:12.612
CAG OPERATOR:
Lookout is smoked, too, sir.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.847
Backup team moving in.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.384
Gunmen down.
Situation defused.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.419
How's Gallo?

20:21.421 --> 20:23.423
He's still down.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.262
(panting)

20:31.698 --> 20:33.333
THEA: Captain Gallo
has secured the phone.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.806
(soft beeping)

20:40.840 --> 20:42.742
NSA is tracing the video call.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.944
Should have
their location shortly.

20:44.977 --> 20:48.948
Khalid will expect to hear
from the negotiator,

20:48.981 --> 20:50.917
confirming his brother is alive.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.752
Every minute that he doesn't get
that call is a minute

20:52.785 --> 20:54.721
that he could get spooked
and cut bait.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.055
Fully aware.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.657
They're working
as fast as they can.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.758
Granola?

21:00.026 --> 21:02.329
I like to eat small meals
every two hours.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.631
Keeps the mind sharp
and the energy up.

21:04.664 --> 21:08.435
(mechanical trilling, beeping)

21:15.708 --> 21:22.349
* She no longer lies

21:22.382 --> 21:26.386
* From what I can see

21:26.419 --> 21:28.721
* I heard it once...

21:28.755 --> 21:31.023
The negotiator had a domino.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.593
Just like Khalid in the video,
just like Goundry.

21:33.626 --> 21:37.397
Brings up a hell of a lot of
questions we have no answers to.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.531
Well, you don't seem
very concerned.
Right now,

21:38.565 --> 21:40.600
I'm more concerned about why
you didn't call that shot.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.470
Coogan is many things,
but he's a pro.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.037
He wouldn't have hit me.

21:45.071 --> 21:48.741
You're right. Happy?

21:48.775 --> 21:50.643
My gut said
they should shoot, but just...

21:50.677 --> 21:54.414
But you didn't. You
second-guessed yourself.

21:54.447 --> 21:57.917
The Madani I know
doesn't flinch.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.653
She's kind of
a stone cold badass.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.923
I just keep replaying it
in my head,

22:03.956 --> 22:05.958
that night,
making the wrong call.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.928
Wrong or right, you saved
my life on that mission.

22:08.961 --> 22:11.598
The only reason I'm here
is 'cause of your gut.

22:11.631 --> 22:14.133
So who knows? Maybe
it ain't so bad.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.669
Yeah. Maybe.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.538
So stop replaying.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.507
Anything like today
happens again,

22:20.540 --> 22:21.974
you take the shot,
you hear me?

22:26.746 --> 22:28.548
THEA:
We got Hendrix
and Kam's location.

22:28.581 --> 22:31.551
Let's get in the air.
Anchor Zero-Six, this
is Renegade One-Two.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.052
We're moving.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.735
(distant shouting in Arabic,
glass breaking)

22:51.838 --> 22:54.974
CRANK:
What the hell's
going on out there?

22:55.007 --> 22:56.676
Can you understand
what they're saying?

22:56.709 --> 22:58.411
Something about moving us.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.647
(men speaking Arabic)

23:00.680 --> 23:02.549
Something about a small pearl?

23:02.582 --> 23:03.816
Okay, we got
to think this through.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.752
All right?
We made a proof-of-life video,

23:05.785 --> 23:06.953
that much we know,

23:06.986 --> 23:09.922
so maybe they're getting ready
to hand us over,

23:09.956 --> 23:11.591
and it could be to our guys,

23:11.624 --> 23:13.826
or it could be
to someone else, maybe ISIS.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.795
You think we're being sold?

23:15.828 --> 23:18.498
You know how valuable
American soldiers are

23:18.531 --> 23:21.968
to ISIS? Alive...

23:22.001 --> 23:23.836
or dead?
Or

23:23.870 --> 23:25.638
the deal could have gone bad.

23:25.672 --> 23:27.874
They don't sound happy
out there.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.644
(grunting)
And if our guys ever

23:31.678 --> 23:32.979
find this place,

23:33.012 --> 23:34.814
they'll find this message.

23:34.847 --> 23:38.885
Maybe they can figure out
what it means.

23:40.119 --> 23:43.856
Okay. They're coming our way.
Hurry!

23:43.890 --> 23:45.692
(panting)

23:45.725 --> 23:48.795
Tokyo?
It's for my wife.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.730
What's it mean?
(panting)

23:53.132 --> 23:55.735
Hope.

24:20.092 --> 24:22.461
Renegade One-Two,
on the ground.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.769
You think they're here?

24:29.802 --> 24:33.039
MADANI: This is where
they traced the call to.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.614
Is that lead?

24:41.648 --> 24:43.516
Is there something
radioactive in there?

24:43.550 --> 24:45.552
Nothing you need to worry about.

24:45.585 --> 24:48.621
Let's move!

25:17.784 --> 25:20.553
I never get this. They think
with some batting practice,

25:20.587 --> 25:23.055
we're not gonna find
what's on these hard drives?

25:23.089 --> 25:24.657
We'll bag and tag
on the way out. Clear the rooms.

25:24.691 --> 25:27.059
Sergeants Kam and Hendrix
are somewhere in here.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.861
Bravo Team.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.968
(sighs)

25:37.604 --> 25:40.006
(sighs)

25:52.852 --> 25:53.686
Room clear.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.588
(sighs)

25:58.791 --> 26:01.093
Clear.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.996
(panting)

26:04.030 --> 26:05.632
THEA:
Our guys aren't here.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.366
You can't clear
rooms that quick.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.235
Double back, make it thorough.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.337
HASKINS:
Keep the chatter to a minimum,
Renegade One-Two.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.740
Let the operators do their job.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.244
The hell are you doing?
They're rushing.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.780
Our guys could be anywhere.
They need to slow down.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.882
You heard Haskins.
They're in there!

26:22.915 --> 26:25.384
What is going on with you?

26:25.417 --> 26:27.086
(sighs)

26:27.119 --> 26:29.388
You did not put Jimmy in that
hospital. You know that, right?

26:29.421 --> 26:31.958
He felt that something was off
about the mission.

26:31.991 --> 26:34.627
I could have pushed for
more intel, but I didn't.

26:34.661 --> 26:37.029
I dismissed him.
You had no idea
what would happen.

26:37.063 --> 26:39.398
He needed me to step up
that day, and I didn't.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.134
So I've been trying to...

26:42.168 --> 26:46.673
be a little more of
that person lately.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.776
You mean, a leader?

26:52.111 --> 26:54.647
Something like that.

27:17.003 --> 27:20.372
They were here.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.775
It's unlikely Khalid's guys
are writing in English.

27:22.809 --> 27:25.011
What the hell is "Tokyo"?

27:25.044 --> 27:26.378
It's the capital
of Japan, sir.

27:26.412 --> 27:29.281
Hey, N-G with the jokes.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.319
We found Sergeant Kam
and Hendrix's cell.

27:33.352 --> 27:34.821
No sign of them.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.723
Anchor Zero-Six,
that's the last room.

27:36.756 --> 27:39.726
They're not here. Over.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.796
Damn it!

27:51.270 --> 27:52.705
That's not the last room.

27:52.739 --> 27:53.940
What do you have?

27:53.973 --> 27:55.775
I pulled the blueprints,

27:55.808 --> 27:57.176
and I cross-referenced
through my intel.

27:57.209 --> 27:58.811
You have blueprints
on a 50-year-old hospital

27:58.845 --> 27:59.912
in a failed state?

27:59.946 --> 28:02.114
I have
my resource networks, too.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.818
I saw something on
Ramirez's body cam.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.720
About ten yards back,

28:07.754 --> 28:08.821
there should have been
a door right here.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.322
All I saw was a cabinet.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.991
Now, if they go back, and
they move that thing,

28:12.024 --> 28:14.026
I think they'll
find a false wall.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.863
You heard
Lieutenant Porter.

28:16.896 --> 28:19.165
Let's see what
these guys are hiding.

28:46.192 --> 28:48.194
Clear.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.530
They're not here.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.966
(groans)

28:54.000 --> 28:56.402
Hey.

28:57.804 --> 28:59.471
We're going to find them.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.473
We won't stop until we do.

29:01.507 --> 29:05.044
Darzi, do a sweep.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.345
Five mikes,
I want to be in the air.

29:07.947 --> 29:10.883
(sighs)

29:15.321 --> 29:17.990
HASKINS:
All right, operators, head back

29:18.024 --> 29:20.860
to the birds. We are wheels up
and patrolling the A-O.

29:20.893 --> 29:23.095
Sergeants Kam
and Hendrix may be close.

29:30.002 --> 29:32.038
Nothing's here.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.909
(panting)

29:39.846 --> 29:41.914
I'd like
to keep some operators here.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.816
There's a lot of intel
left behind.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.584
HASKINS:
Roger. Renegade One-Two,
stay and collect.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.587
Renegade One-One team,
head to your bird.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.957
The Little Birds
will be overhead in support.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.959
Everything in this room is
need-to-know moving forward.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.393
Understood?

29:56.128 --> 29:58.931
Director, I need
to speak with you privately.

30:16.415 --> 30:17.884
(beep)

30:17.917 --> 30:20.887
Sir, the secondary objective
was gone.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.855
All of it.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.623
MAGNUS:
But it was there?

30:24.656 --> 30:26.859
High confidence.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.209
I've got an I.E.D.!

30:43.242 --> 30:45.044
Where?
COOGAN:
In the hospital?

30:45.077 --> 30:47.579
THEA:
Outside in the truck. Darzi!

30:48.915 --> 30:50.883
Get out of there!
Get your ass out of there!

30:54.420 --> 30:56.322
I've got a hostile!

30:56.355 --> 30:57.924
MAGNUS:
Thea, don't fire.

31:03.996 --> 31:05.264
THEA:
Darzi, run!

31:06.365 --> 31:09.135
(explosion)

31:25.517 --> 31:27.920
Comms and body
cams are down.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.555
Give me the Reaper feed.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.260
Can't see a damn thing
down there.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.598
(beeping)

31:42.134 --> 31:43.970
(beeping volume increases)
Nora!

31:44.003 --> 31:45.972
Shutting down.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.308
(beeping stops)

31:49.341 --> 31:51.377
I think shrapnel got
me. How bad is it?

31:51.410 --> 31:52.611
Darzi's hurt.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.214
Come on.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.049
GALLO:
There we go.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.919
(grunting)

32:05.224 --> 32:07.159
(panting)

32:13.165 --> 32:15.234
The blast took out the radio.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.402
Is that something we can fix?

32:16.435 --> 32:18.504
MADANI:
I don't think so.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.039
(beeping)

32:21.473 --> 32:22.574
I can't feel my toes.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.076
You're gonna be okay.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.244
Get him a fentanyl pop!

32:25.277 --> 32:27.079
No, the fire
took out the med kit.

32:27.113 --> 32:27.980
We've got
to get out of here ASAP.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.415
I think the blast
hit the tail rotor.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.516
He's got to get
medical attention.

32:30.549 --> 32:32.084
We can't fly without it.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.119
(groaning, panting loudly)

32:34.286 --> 32:36.188
I'll go take a look.

32:36.222 --> 32:37.556
Hang in there, buddy.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.509
Okay, good news, bad news.

32:57.543 --> 33:00.079
There's no damage
to the tail rotor,

33:00.112 --> 33:01.580
but the chip wire's been cut.

33:01.613 --> 33:02.581
Can you fix it?

33:03.782 --> 33:06.485
Uh, depends.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.054
"Depends" is not gonna cut it.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.621
We burn time, Darzi bleeds out.

33:20.466 --> 33:23.035
I got this.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.536
Hey. Hey.
Look at me.
(grunting)

33:24.570 --> 33:26.572
We don't really get to
shoot the breeze, do we?

33:26.605 --> 33:28.574
You got daughters, right?
Tell me about 'em.

33:28.607 --> 33:29.641
Two angels, sir.
Yeah?

33:29.675 --> 33:31.177
And an idiot stepson.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.711
(chuckles)
I need to see them again.

33:32.744 --> 33:35.614
You will.
I promise you, you will.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.716
You got any kids, Captain?

33:37.749 --> 33:39.318
Not that I know of.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.353
Why? You hear any different?

33:41.387 --> 33:42.554
I just hear
you're a ladies' man.

33:42.588 --> 33:44.690
See? Been paying people
a lot of money

33:44.723 --> 33:47.193
to spread that rumor.
I'm glad it's paying off.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.428
Stay here, man.

33:49.461 --> 33:51.363
Come on. Madani!

34:06.678 --> 34:08.114
What do you need?

34:08.147 --> 34:09.581
You tell me what you need,
and I'll do it.

34:09.615 --> 34:11.550
Just... You just stay with me.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.419
Okay? Please?

34:13.452 --> 34:15.654
Madani'll fly.
I'm not going anywhere.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.226
(grunting loudly)

34:28.567 --> 34:29.601
We're good to go.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.603
MAN:
Load up!
Stone-cold badass.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.372
Get us airborne, Madani.

34:37.509 --> 34:39.111
You're clear.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.779
I'm staying with him.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.700
Hey, Darzi.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.669
Take these.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.404
What are you doing?

35:05.437 --> 35:07.606
He's in pain,
and those will help.

35:07.639 --> 35:08.840
That's all that matters
right now.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.776
Damn it, Nora.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.621
(phone ringing)

35:28.594 --> 35:30.562
Where are you? What happened?

35:30.596 --> 35:32.464
THEA: Comms got taken out
by the blast.

35:32.498 --> 35:33.565
Darzi was injured.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.234
We're en route to the F.O.B.

35:35.267 --> 35:36.435
to get him medical attention.

35:36.468 --> 35:37.469
Any more casualties?

35:37.503 --> 35:38.470
THEA:
Negative.

35:38.504 --> 35:41.273
And Madani just saved our asses.

35:51.217 --> 35:52.851
MAN: One, two, three.
One, two, three.
SOLDIERS: One. Two.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.225
Sir.

35:59.258 --> 36:00.759
Come on in.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.728
Renegade elements
are five minutes out,

36:02.761 --> 36:04.230
and I just got word

36:04.263 --> 36:06.765
that Darzi has exited
surgery at Lemonnier.

36:06.798 --> 36:09.335
He's stable.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.770
I'd say workhorse.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.405
Excuse me?

36:13.439 --> 36:15.907
I wasn't sure earlier--
workhorse or show horse.

36:15.941 --> 36:19.311
But... you showed me
something today.

36:19.345 --> 36:22.314
I take it that the false wall
proved valuable.

36:22.348 --> 36:25.251
It was not insignificant.
What'd you find?

36:25.284 --> 36:26.918
That's above
your security clearance.

36:26.952 --> 36:29.321
Course, if you want
that clearance,

36:29.355 --> 36:31.490
you should consider coming
to work for us at Langley.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.892
Military intelligence
has a lot of barriers.

36:33.925 --> 36:36.595
We could free things up for you.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.330
I believe Thea's talked to you
about that.

36:38.364 --> 36:41.800
Not so sure
the CIA is for me, sir.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.902
(chuckles softly)

36:43.935 --> 36:46.872
You'll come around, Porter.

36:48.874 --> 36:52.511
You know they're
gonna debrief Darzi.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.746
He's gonna tell them
about those painkillers.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.615
What did you expect me to do?

36:56.648 --> 36:57.483
Maybe listen to me.

36:58.984 --> 37:00.919
I told you
not to let anybody see them.

37:00.952 --> 37:03.789
I was able to help Darzi,
so I did.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.391
I'd do it again.

37:05.424 --> 37:06.892
Any other flight lead

37:06.925 --> 37:08.694
would bring this up
to the colonel right now.

37:08.727 --> 37:09.861
You really want to talk
about all the ways

37:09.895 --> 37:12.664
that you're not
just another flight lead?

37:14.933 --> 37:18.537
* Oh, I may not be a lover

37:18.570 --> 37:19.771
* May not be a lover *

37:19.805 --> 37:21.373
* I always been a fighter

37:21.407 --> 37:23.041
* Always been a fighter *

37:23.074 --> 37:24.943
* But I'll be...

37:24.976 --> 37:28.046
Good to see you,
Lieutenant Porter.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.915
Welcome back.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.618
What do you say
we get out of here?

37:34.786 --> 37:37.656
Oh, shoot.

37:37.689 --> 37:39.858
Forgot my other girlfriend's
still at my place.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.793
Ooh.
Yeah.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.495
Awkward.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.897
Well, my other boyfriend's
out of town, so...

37:45.931 --> 37:48.534
I guess we're good at mine.

37:50.101 --> 37:53.672
* May not be a lover

37:53.705 --> 37:55.807
* Always been a fighter

37:55.841 --> 37:59.778
* But I'll be

37:59.811 --> 38:00.979
* I'll be a...

38:02.981 --> 38:05.684
She sure took some damage.

38:05.717 --> 38:09.488
Could've been a
lot worse, sir.

38:09.521 --> 38:12.391
I hate to say it, but...

38:12.424 --> 38:13.959
Thea did good out there.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.694
So did Madani.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.763
And you.
Look around.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.732
You see Jimmy or Hendrix?

38:20.766 --> 38:22.401
I didn't do a damn thing.

38:22.434 --> 38:23.869
They're still alive.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.404
We can assume that.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.906
(sighs)
Khalid's clock ran out, but...

38:29.941 --> 38:32.010
...if he had followed through
with what he'd promised,

38:32.043 --> 38:33.712
he would have
released a video.

38:33.745 --> 38:36.715
Wouldn't pass up that kind
of propaganda opportunity.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.617
I guess we got that
going for us, then.

38:38.650 --> 38:39.951
Means there's still hope, son.

38:41.587 --> 38:42.888
We'll find 'em.

38:42.921 --> 38:45.757
We flew through
some of the worst weather

38:45.791 --> 38:47.559
I've ever seen.

38:47.593 --> 38:49.695
I impersonated
a dead guy.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.463
Helped Darzi
get to safety.

38:51.497 --> 38:53.865
I did everything right.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.834
And still the mission failed.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.636
I understand.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.605
Sometimes that's how it is
on the battlefield.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.373
I'll never get used to that.
Being a leader

39:01.407 --> 39:02.974
isn't always about
the result, son.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.878
No one ever said
this would be simple.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.814
But I'm proud of you

39:08.847 --> 39:10.949
and what you did over there.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.951
You should be, too.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.853
* Come on and take me down

39:14.886 --> 39:16.655
* Oh *

39:16.688 --> 39:19.858
* Oh, take me down *

39:19.891 --> 39:21.460
* Yeah

39:21.493 --> 39:23.629
* The Devil's
got his eye on me *

39:23.662 --> 39:25.096
* He's gonna take me down

39:25.130 --> 39:29.000
* Oh, take me down *

39:29.034 --> 39:31.937
* Oh *

39:31.970 --> 39:35.874
* Oh, take me down *

39:35.907 --> 39:37.976
* Oh. *

39:39.945 --> 39:42.113
How much should we worry
about this?

39:42.147 --> 39:43.949
I would say a nine out of ten.

39:45.150 --> 39:46.752
But that's not why I wanted
to see you.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.854
Okay, look, before you say
anything else, I know.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.155
I defied orders out there.

39:50.188 --> 39:51.890
But we had a hostile
trying to take out

39:51.923 --> 39:53.959
a $30 million helicopter
and its flight crew.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.928
I had the shot, so I took it.

39:57.963 --> 39:59.230
You made a good call.

39:59.264 --> 40:02.167
The kind of call an experienced
field operative would have made.

40:02.200 --> 40:05.671
Of course, that's not the
only order you disobeyed.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.172
You were having
these pilots followed.

40:07.205 --> 40:09.508
Madani and Gallo. That's done.

40:09.541 --> 40:12.010
Something is up
with the two of them.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.712
Their debriefs don't add up.

40:13.745 --> 40:14.846
It's a hunch, and it's over.

40:14.880 --> 40:15.914
Where is that coming from?

40:15.947 --> 40:17.716
You send a lot of e-mails, Thea.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.618
I need you focused.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.019
We got this to worry about,

40:21.052 --> 40:22.521
and you're tossing away
resources.

40:22.554 --> 40:24.022
My ass is getting chewed out

40:24.055 --> 40:27.459
by House intel,
so this ends today.

40:27.493 --> 40:29.194
Besides...

40:29.227 --> 40:32.063
I need you back in the field.

40:42.007 --> 40:44.175
Davis Goundry is still alive.
Yes.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.877
The traitor is living,

40:45.911 --> 40:47.546
and somehow he made his
way out of Somalia.

40:47.579 --> 40:49.748
That was taken two
days ago in Berlin.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.049
All our intel suggests

40:51.082 --> 40:52.918
that he's trying to make
his way back to America,

40:52.951 --> 40:54.920
and not because he is homesick.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.988
And Richard? Any word on him?

40:57.022 --> 40:58.189
Still nothing.

40:58.223 --> 41:00.592
I'm sorry.

41:00.626 --> 41:02.894
I want you in Berlin.

41:02.928 --> 41:04.496
Find Goundry.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.097
You recruited him.
You know how he thinks

41:06.131 --> 41:07.866
better than anyone.
I want you to bring him in.

41:07.899 --> 41:10.502
I'm on the next flight.
Good.

41:10.536 --> 41:12.504
And word of this new development

41:12.538 --> 41:15.006
does not leave this room.
