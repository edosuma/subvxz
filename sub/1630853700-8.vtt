WEBVTT

00:01.566 --> 00:03.873
- You brought this shit into
the community? You lied to me.

00:03.916 --> 00:06.223
- I'm trying to apologize.
- Well, guess what, Hayley,

00:06.267 --> 00:08.399
I don't give a shit if
you feel better.

00:08.443 --> 00:10.314
- You know what you do want?
- Same thing I wanted

00:10.358 --> 00:12.012
since I was ten,
to be an astronaut.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.796
About as likely as me
and Emma, huh?

00:13.839 --> 00:15.798
- Did you know I was taken?
- We always assumed

00:15.841 --> 00:17.930
that the adoption was
consensual.

00:17.974 --> 00:20.107
- I'm sorry.
North House is my heart.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.804
- And Jeremy?
- He is too.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.632
- I knew I should've examined
you after the car accident.

00:23.675 --> 00:25.199
Panic attacks are totally
normal.

00:25.242 --> 00:28.115
I'm sending you the information
for a counsellor.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.030
Call him, set up an appointment.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.207
[soft music]

00:36.123 --> 00:39.213
- Help! Help!

00:40.388 --> 00:42.564
Please, I need help!

00:43.521 --> 00:46.568
[wind howling]

00:46.611 --> 00:48.396
[engine humming]

00:49.484 --> 00:52.139
- Nine in the morning,
and it's still dark out.

00:52.182 --> 00:54.358
Big storm coming too,
on FlightRadar.

00:54.402 --> 00:57.318
I dream about
living somewhere hot, like,

00:57.361 --> 01:01.800
no boots, no thermals,
just sunny skies and tequila.

01:01.844 --> 01:04.107
- I don't trust anywhere
that doesn't have four
distinct seasons.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.587
- Masochist.

01:08.285 --> 01:09.939
[wind howling]

01:12.028 --> 01:13.421
[heart pounding]

01:13.464 --> 01:16.467
[tense music]

01:16.511 --> 01:18.382
[breathing deeply]

01:21.168 --> 01:23.083
[glass shattering]

01:25.259 --> 01:26.912
[panting]

01:28.958 --> 01:30.525
- I need air.

01:32.135 --> 01:34.094
[beeping]
- What's going on?

01:34.137 --> 01:36.139
Speed. Nowak, check your
airspeed.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.358
[beeping]

01:37.880 --> 01:39.490
- Nowak!

01:39.534 --> 01:41.449
- We're losing speed.
I have control.

01:42.450 --> 01:45.235
[panting]

01:55.202 --> 01:56.725
Are we gonna talk about what
just happened?

01:56.768 --> 01:58.857
- What is there to talk about?

01:58.901 --> 02:01.512
I had a moment of distraction,
and my FO overreacted.

02:01.556 --> 02:04.385
- You saw! We couldn't reach
him. What's up with you?

02:04.428 --> 02:06.474
The weather wasn't that bad,
we've flown through worse.

02:06.517 --> 02:07.823
- I just got light-headed
for a second.

02:07.866 --> 02:09.303
- You said you'd see
a counsellor.

02:09.346 --> 02:11.305
- Counsellor? What's going on?

02:12.436 --> 02:14.003
- The panic attacks.

02:14.569 --> 02:16.048
- This has happened before?

02:16.092 --> 02:17.441
- Never in the air.

02:17.485 --> 02:18.790
It's not a big deal.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.053
Sometimes I get a memory
of the car accident.

02:21.097 --> 02:23.012
- What did the counsellor say?

02:24.840 --> 02:28.583
- This is something that I can
handle on my own. It's fine.

02:28.626 --> 02:30.541
- You know you can't fly again,
right?

02:30.585 --> 02:31.934
Not until you've dealt
with this.

02:31.977 --> 02:34.066
- I'll get some sleep,
regroup tomorrow.

02:42.292 --> 02:44.381
[man on radio]: It may just be
flurries out there now,

02:44.425 --> 02:48.124
but don't be fooled. We're in
for a big one tonight, folks,

02:48.168 --> 02:50.866
with a heavy snowfall warning
in effect.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.607
- I'll replace this.

02:52.650 --> 02:55.392
Yeah, that one's yours now.
What's with the duds?

02:56.524 --> 02:58.961
- I've been invited to
Selection Camp.

02:59.004 --> 03:01.224
With Space Program Canada.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.531
- Whoa! Way to go, kid!

03:04.836 --> 03:07.622
So, how many people get chosen
for Selection Camp?

03:07.665 --> 03:09.058
- 72.

03:09.101 --> 03:11.234
Out of 4,000 applicants.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.627
- Whoa.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.281
- Yeah, I had a bunch of
interviews,

03:14.324 --> 03:16.935
and I thought today was just
going to be another one,

03:16.979 --> 03:18.676
but they told me I'm in.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.983
- That's amazing.
- Yeah, so I hung up on them.

03:21.026 --> 03:22.637
- What?
- Look, I don't know,

03:22.680 --> 03:25.248
I panicked, alright?

03:25.292 --> 03:27.772
It's bad, isn't it?
I know it's bad.

03:27.816 --> 03:30.079
Astronauts can't panic.
That's their whole thing.

03:30.122 --> 03:31.907
- It's kinda your thing too,
Chops.

03:31.950 --> 03:33.822
You know how to handle
yourself.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.998
- In a plane, yes.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.261
But Selection Camp is designed
to screw with you.

03:38.305 --> 03:39.741
That's their whole point.

03:39.784 --> 03:41.133
They throw you into crazy
situations

03:41.177 --> 03:43.658
to see if you have what it takes
to figure it out.

03:46.748 --> 03:48.880
What if I don't?

03:49.403 --> 03:53.233
- Okay. I'm gonna go and wake up
Nowak so he can

03:53.276 --> 03:54.712
Polish some sense into you
on this.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.236
- He's gone.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.238
I saw him leave a couple hours
ago in his flight suit.

03:58.281 --> 04:00.240
I think he was doing a run
to North House.

04:03.504 --> 04:04.983
[phone beeps]

04:05.027 --> 04:06.681
[phone ringing tone]

04:06.724 --> 04:09.031
[Nowak]: Hey, Lex.
- What are you doing?

04:09.074 --> 04:11.686
You shouldn't be flying
right now. You told me
you wouldn't fly.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.818
- I got some rest,
I'm feeling a lot better.

04:13.862 --> 04:16.691
- If you're not at full health,
you're putting people in danger.

04:16.734 --> 04:18.345
Don't make me have
to report you.

04:18.388 --> 04:20.347
- I kept your secret,
didn't I?

04:20.390 --> 04:21.826
- It's not the same thing.

04:21.870 --> 04:25.395
Don't make me have to lie again,
for you of all people.

04:26.701 --> 04:29.181
I love you, but I...

04:29.965 --> 04:34.099
I won't let anyone do this
to me again. I can't.

04:35.275 --> 04:39.235
You have until you get back
to Thompson to tell Chief Pilot
Pierce what's going on,

04:39.279 --> 04:41.063
or I will.

04:42.238 --> 04:44.240
[man on radio]: The roads are
really bad out there, folks.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.024
There is a multi-vehicle pile-up
in town,

04:46.068 --> 04:47.896
not to mention all the cars
that are off the road.

04:47.939 --> 04:50.202
I would say don't go out
unless you absolutely have to.

04:50.246 --> 04:52.074
- Shouldn't the guys
be back by now?

04:52.117 --> 04:54.381
- Bodes and Nowak know how
to handle themselves

04:54.424 --> 04:55.904
in weather like this.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.122
[knocking]

04:58.515 --> 04:59.951
- Please. We heard nurses
live here?

04:59.995 --> 05:01.910
- Nurses do, but they're all out
right now. We're pilots.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.433
- Well, why don't you
come inside?

05:03.477 --> 05:05.522
- What's wrong? What happened?

05:05.566 --> 05:07.307
- Please. You have to sit.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.744
The roads are bad and
there's trees down everywhere,

05:09.787 --> 05:12.355
and we swerved and we slid
into the ditch,

05:12.399 --> 05:13.835
and Gordon hit
the steering column.

05:13.878 --> 05:15.532
[strained]: That's enough, Abby.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.404
- We should call an ambulance.

05:18.405 --> 05:21.103
- We'll go to the car now.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.670
[wheezing]

05:22.713 --> 05:24.411
- No!
- What is it? What is it?

05:24.454 --> 05:26.238
[phone ringing]

05:26.282 --> 05:27.936
- Lex, I know what
you're going to say.

05:27.979 --> 05:29.329
- Tris, I need your help.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.287
We have a hurt patient here.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.855
All the nurses are out, we can't
get through to an ambulance,

05:33.898 --> 05:36.814
he just collapsed.
- Okay, so what's the source
of this injury?

05:36.858 --> 05:38.686
- He was driving and
he hit the steering column.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.514
He's been having a hard
time breathing.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.037
- Are there any visible wounds?

05:46.346 --> 05:47.608
- Uh...

05:48.652 --> 05:50.175
No cuts or bruising.

05:50.219 --> 05:52.090
- You need to get vitals.
Grab a flight bag.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.919
- W-We don't have one.
- Where's Hayley, isn't she off?

05:54.963 --> 05:56.617
- I don't know,
but she's not here.

05:56.660 --> 05:59.359
The only thing I could find
was Crystal's spare stethoscope

05:59.402 --> 06:00.838
and some gloves.
- Okay, uh,

06:00.882 --> 06:02.362
can you check his wrist
for a pulse?

06:03.493 --> 06:04.799
- It's really fast.

06:04.842 --> 06:06.322
- I need you to use
the stethoscope

06:06.366 --> 06:07.802
to check both sides
of his chest.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.630
Put it on his sides along
the nipple line

06:09.673 --> 06:11.980
and tell me what you hear.
- It's a lot quieter
on the left.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.198
- It's pneumothorax.

06:13.242 --> 06:14.591
- He needs it decompressed

06:14.635 --> 06:15.984
with a chest tube
or he'll arrest.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.464
- W-What does that mean?

06:17.507 --> 06:19.379
- A chest tube goes through
the chest wall

06:19.422 --> 06:20.989
and drains any compressed air
from the heart and the lungs.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.295
- We don't have a doctor
or a chest tube,

06:23.339 --> 06:25.297
and we can't make it to an ER.
- Please, please,

06:25.341 --> 06:27.256
you have to help him!
His neck, it looks funny.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.910
- His veins are all swollen.

06:28.953 --> 06:31.173
- Tristan, they're running out
of time.

06:31.216 --> 06:33.610
- Maybe you should take Hayden
into Nowak's room,

06:33.654 --> 06:35.351
it's over there on the left.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.484
- Okay, so we need a tube,

06:37.527 --> 06:40.748
the ability to puncture skin,
and, uh, suction.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.314
[Tristan]: That's right.

06:42.358 --> 06:45.361
- Okay, let's see, here.

06:49.670 --> 06:50.975
This should puncture through
the muscle,

06:51.019 --> 06:52.803
like the chest tube would,
correct?

06:52.847 --> 06:55.240
- Uh, we wouldn't recommend
an improvised home surgery.

06:55.284 --> 06:57.547
- His pulse is weak.
I can barely feel it.

06:58.069 --> 06:59.854
- A pen won't puncture the skin.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.943
You're gonna need to make
an incision first.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.647
[Gordon wheezing]

07:17.524 --> 07:20.048
Find the second rib
on Gordon's chest.

07:20.091 --> 07:23.399
You'll feel a hump.
Count down four or five ribs.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.228
You're gonna want to be
on between the 4th and 5th
intercostal

07:26.271 --> 07:28.273
on the nipple line
towards Gordon's right side,

07:28.317 --> 07:30.798
down by his armpit.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.887
[Emma]: You have to go
over the rib

07:32.930 --> 07:34.628
when you put the tube in,
not under it,

07:34.671 --> 07:36.456
or else you'll risk damaging
the nerve.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.850
- Ready? Ready.

07:39.894 --> 07:43.419
- Make a small incision
so it can fit the straw in.

07:49.077 --> 07:51.514
Okay, good. Poke your finger
into the incision

07:51.558 --> 07:53.255
to make a little room.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.564
- Uh... Hmm...

08:03.265 --> 08:05.049
Oh, uh, okay...

08:05.093 --> 08:07.269
- It's gonna take a lot of force
to punch through the muscle wall

08:07.312 --> 08:10.011
to get the tube in. Once
you feel it push through, stop.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.404
You don't want to go too far
and puncture the lung.

08:12.448 --> 08:13.754
- Uh...

08:15.103 --> 08:17.366
Okay.
- You'll feel a rush of air

08:17.409 --> 08:19.237
when you get to the pleural
space. Okay, and then--

08:19.281 --> 08:20.935
[phone beeping]

08:20.978 --> 08:22.937
- Ah, shit.
[both]: Shit.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.853
- We can't wait until
the line comes back up,
we have to finish this.

08:27.289 --> 08:30.031
[air whooshing]
Ah, I'm in.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.250
I did it, I think I did it.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.339
- That's good,
that's what we want, right?

08:34.383 --> 08:35.906
- Oh, it's sucking back in.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.299
The goal is to vent
the stuff out.

08:37.342 --> 08:39.431
- Please, please, do something.
He can't breathe.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.129
- You got a condom?

08:41.172 --> 08:44.872
I need something flexible,
to create a valve.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.222
- Okay.

08:48.615 --> 08:51.487
Okay. Will this work?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.707
- Yes, cut the end.
- Okay.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.798
[indistinct whispering]

08:57.841 --> 09:00.235
- Okay, tape.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.159
[Gordon breathing]

09:11.202 --> 09:13.335
[chuckling]

09:14.858 --> 09:17.992
- You just made a chest tube out
of a straw and a balloon.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.428
[laughing]

09:19.471 --> 09:21.212
That's some real astronaut shit.

09:22.562 --> 09:26.130
Gordon's stable for now,
but he needs a hospital.

09:28.698 --> 09:30.352
I know it's none
of my business

09:30.395 --> 09:33.181
and I don't know anything
about your marriage,

09:33.224 --> 09:35.357
but why wouldn't he let
you call an ambulance?

09:35.400 --> 09:37.315
If you need help,
I can help you.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.144
- It's not like that.

09:42.843 --> 09:46.368
- I know people have to leave
when they're ready, but...

09:46.411 --> 09:48.979
don't cover for Gordon
if it means hurting yourself,

09:49.023 --> 09:52.504
or your kid. No one deserves
that kind of loyalty.

09:53.375 --> 09:57.466
- Gordon's not my husband.
He's my father.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.208
Hayden's dad...

10:01.383 --> 10:02.689
We're getting divorced.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.866
I tried to fight for
full custody,

10:05.909 --> 10:09.130
but I can't afford the lawyers
that he can, so...

10:10.740 --> 10:13.656
The last time that
I left Hayden with his dad

10:13.700 --> 10:15.266
for his court-ordered weekend,

10:16.006 --> 10:19.575
Hayden walked home alone
three miles

10:19.619 --> 10:21.882
because he was scared of him.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.712
That's when I knew, I...

10:26.451 --> 10:30.194
I couldn't leave my son with him
even one more time.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.721
- You custody-napped your son.

10:34.764 --> 10:37.027
- My ex called the cops,
then the storm hit.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.550
And I knew my dad was hurt,

10:38.594 --> 10:41.075
but I didn't want to call
an ambulance.

10:41.118 --> 10:43.947
What if they recognized
me at the hospital?

10:43.991 --> 10:45.601
Then I would go to jail

10:45.645 --> 10:47.472
and Hayden would go
to his dad full time.

10:48.125 --> 10:51.825
Wait, please. Now that you know,
what are you gonna do?

10:51.868 --> 10:54.828
[tense music]

10:59.963 --> 11:01.922
[Lexi]: You know you can't fly
again, right?

11:01.965 --> 11:03.750
Not until you've dealt
with this.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.186
[Nowak]: It's fine.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.755
[sighing]

11:13.411 --> 11:15.544
[phone ringing]

11:17.415 --> 11:18.939
This is Nowak.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.636
[dispatch]: Hey, we're stretched
thin tonight

11:20.680 --> 11:22.464
with the storm moving in.

11:22.507 --> 11:25.119
Can you fly Right Seat to take
a patient to North House?

11:26.468 --> 11:29.819
We wouldn't ask,
but since you've been looking
for extra shifts...

11:30.690 --> 11:33.780
- Uh, I'm on my way.
- Great. Thanks.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.607
[phone beeps]

11:53.495 --> 11:57.412
- Wow. Captain Nowak kept
himself Right Seat qualified?

11:57.455 --> 11:59.849
You must need money pretty bad.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.765
- Nope. Just gunning
to be a Training Captain.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.985
Looks good in AC interviews.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.814
Well, most peoples' interviews.

12:09.859 --> 12:12.079
- Are you sure
you should be doing this?

12:12.122 --> 12:13.733
You promised Lexi
you wouldn't.

12:16.648 --> 12:18.520
- Park break.
- Set.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.610
[soft music]

12:22.002 --> 12:23.177
- The snow isn't too bad yet,

12:23.220 --> 12:25.353
but we'll wait inside
the hangar.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.096
Our ride should be here
any minute, Dale.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.446
[phone ringing]

12:32.752 --> 12:34.101
How you doing?

12:37.365 --> 12:40.194
[phone beeps]
- Hey, Lex.

12:40.237 --> 12:41.543
[Lexi]: What are you doing?

12:41.586 --> 12:42.762
You shouldn't be flying
right now.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.198
You told me you wouldn't fly.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.590
[sighing]

12:45.634 --> 12:48.028
- I got some rest,
I'm feeling a lot better.

12:48.071 --> 12:51.509
- If you're not at full health,
you're putting people in danger.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.642
Don't make me have
to report you.

12:54.556 --> 12:56.863
- I kept your secret,
didn't I?

12:56.906 --> 13:00.736
- It's not the same thing.
Don't make me have to lie again.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.738
You have until you get back
to Thompson

13:02.782 --> 13:04.609
to tell Chief Pilot Pierce
what's going on,

13:04.653 --> 13:06.263
or I will.

13:08.613 --> 13:09.919
[phone beeps]

13:09.963 --> 13:11.529
- You told Lexi I was flying!

13:11.573 --> 13:14.924
- No. But considering how small
SkyMed is,

13:14.968 --> 13:16.578
you can't be surprised
she found out.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.623
I'm not happy about it either.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.712
I care about you, Nowak.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.323
[phone ringing]

13:23.759 --> 13:25.674
Our ride's here.

13:27.284 --> 13:30.157
Come on, Dale. We're heading
to the nursing station.

13:32.202 --> 13:34.814
[breathing heavily]

13:39.819 --> 13:41.429
[sighing]

13:41.472 --> 13:44.171
- That's like a thousand dollar
punching bag you got there.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.784
I powered down 911,
but we're gonna have to try

13:48.828 --> 13:50.830
and keep up with the snow.
If it freezes on the wings,

13:50.873 --> 13:52.875
we won't be able to get out
of here.

13:53.658 --> 13:55.051
- I'll take the first shift.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.104
[phone ringing tone]

14:04.147 --> 14:05.540
Hi, Mom.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.281
[Irena]: Milosz. Are you calling
about Lukasz?

14:07.324 --> 14:09.413
He has two offers
from competing universities.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.937
- That's great.

14:11.763 --> 14:14.201
- I need to ask a favour, um...

14:14.941 --> 14:17.117
Can I borrow money for
a new headset?

14:17.160 --> 14:20.381
I can pay interest. I have
a second job, and if I need to,

14:20.424 --> 14:22.470
I can get a third job
to pay it back faster.

14:22.513 --> 14:25.255
- If I helped, it would be
endorsing your career choice.

14:25.299 --> 14:28.215
You know I can't do that.
- Yeah, okay.

14:29.129 --> 14:32.045
Tell Dad I said hello.
- I will.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.395
[phone beeps]

14:39.052 --> 14:43.230
[wind howling]

14:44.231 --> 14:45.885
[switches clicking]

14:52.674 --> 14:54.850
[tense music]

14:57.679 --> 14:59.333
[wind howling]

14:59.376 --> 15:01.988
- Tris is waiting for Crystal
to show up with another patient,

15:02.031 --> 15:04.425
but she's taking forever.
- You left the boost pumps on.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.515
- I turned the master off.
- It doesn't matter.

15:07.558 --> 15:10.910
You left the goddamn boost pumps
on. The battery's dead, Bodie.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.477
- I was worried about
keeping the plane clear,

15:13.521 --> 15:15.436
I must've rushed out
of the cockpit and forgot.

15:15.479 --> 15:17.568
- Oh, so any second, Tristan's
going to show up with a patient,

15:17.612 --> 15:19.483
and we won't be able to start
the plane.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.964
- We'll get someone
to fly us a new battery
and an AME from Thompson.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.314
- In this storm?!
It's the Captain's job

15:24.358 --> 15:26.534
to make sure you turn
the boost pumps off.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.275
If I was in the Left Seat,
this never would've happened.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.320
- What the hell is your problem,
man?

15:30.364 --> 15:33.758
- You! You're a crap pilot,
you do dumb shit

15:33.802 --> 15:35.195
like leave the boost pumps on!

15:35.238 --> 15:36.848
And everyone treats you like
you're the shit.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.241
Chopper's a way better pilot,

15:38.285 --> 15:40.330
but somehow Bodie's always
the hero.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.811
You're just a rich kid who had
everything handed to him.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.510
- You don't know a damn thing
about me.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.164
You wanna talk shitty pilots?

15:48.208 --> 15:50.558
What the hell is going on
with you? Tristan acting
all worried?

15:50.601 --> 15:53.169
What exactly do you not want
everyone to know, huh?

15:53.213 --> 15:54.954
Is Iceman finally cracking
under the pressure

15:54.997 --> 15:56.042
of his own goddamn ego?

15:56.085 --> 15:57.652
[grunting]

16:02.004 --> 16:03.745
[breathing heavily]

16:03.788 --> 16:05.616
[grunting]

16:23.983 --> 16:25.767
[wind howling]

16:25.810 --> 16:26.986
[phone ringing]

16:30.641 --> 16:33.035
- Hayley?
- Bodie? We need...

16:33.079 --> 16:34.428
hospital.
[audio cutting]

16:34.471 --> 16:36.212
- Hayley, I can't hear you.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.693
- Madison-- Can you hear...
[phone beeping]

16:39.476 --> 16:40.738
- Shit.

16:42.131 --> 16:44.742
- Tree or something
must've taken out a tower.

16:44.786 --> 16:47.049
- She said something about
Madison and the hospital.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.225
- She's not due yet, is she?

16:49.269 --> 16:50.879
- Not for another two months.

16:50.922 --> 16:53.882
You know, I tried to apologize,
but she's not talking to me.

16:54.317 --> 16:57.320
I actually want to be
in my kid's life.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.718
But I messed that up.

17:05.850 --> 17:09.680
You know those rich parents
you're always giving me shit
about?

17:11.856 --> 17:15.077
Yeah, they stole me
from my Indigenous birth mother.

17:15.121 --> 17:18.559
And my white parents just...
went along with it.

17:19.821 --> 17:21.475
- Shit.

17:21.518 --> 17:25.392
- My whole life,
I thought she gave me up.

17:26.001 --> 17:28.003
I thought it was a choice.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.919
[wind howling]

17:32.138 --> 17:34.270
Afro-Indigenous kid

17:34.314 --> 17:36.620
raised by white folks
in a rich neighbourhood

17:36.664 --> 17:38.318
with nobody who looked like me,

17:38.361 --> 17:40.407
nobody who knew where
I was from.

17:40.450 --> 17:41.712
No one who knew who I was.

17:43.149 --> 17:46.978
See, but I know what
a pilot is. I know how to be,

17:47.022 --> 17:49.068
and where I'm supposed to be.

17:49.111 --> 17:52.723
But if I'm not gonna go
to an airline

17:52.767 --> 17:54.638
and I'm not gonna be a pilot...

17:58.077 --> 18:00.079
Who am I?

18:02.777 --> 18:06.998
- I had a panic attack after
my car accident.

18:07.042 --> 18:09.784
Sometimes when
I'm in the plane...

18:10.785 --> 18:11.873
I'm afraid.

18:16.225 --> 18:18.097
- Is that why you broke
your headset?

18:18.140 --> 18:19.446
[scoffs]

18:19.489 --> 18:22.362
- If my head's screwed up,
I can't be a pilot,

18:22.405 --> 18:24.364
which my parents would love.

18:24.407 --> 18:25.974
They think it's beneath me.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.671
- Being a pilot's impressive.

18:27.715 --> 18:30.674
What do they expect,
a brain surgeon?

18:30.718 --> 18:33.547
- Actually, my brother
has a PhD in neuroscience.

18:33.590 --> 18:36.463
I think that's why
I hated you so much.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.293
You had a family that wanted
you to live your dreams.

18:42.686 --> 18:45.167
I've wanted to go to
a major airline for so long,

18:45.211 --> 18:47.691
but I'm not even sure
if I want it for me anymore.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.217
I don't know if I want to fly
because I love it

18:51.260 --> 18:53.567
or just to prove
my parents wrong.

18:53.610 --> 18:54.959
[wind howling]

18:55.003 --> 18:57.048
Flying is the only time
I ever feel like myself.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.792
[soft music]

19:07.276 --> 19:08.843
- Snow's letting up.

19:09.844 --> 19:12.890
We could, uh, clear the plane
and go try and pick up Madison

19:12.934 --> 19:16.329
and the baby... But I...
drained the battery.

19:21.986 --> 19:24.250
It's busted, dude.

19:24.815 --> 19:26.208
We can't fly that,
we're not rated.

19:27.818 --> 19:30.169
- It's a 12 volt.
- The 200 takes 24.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.220
- Another 12.

19:38.264 --> 19:41.223
We can hook them up in a series
to the 24 volt in the plane.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.486
We can jump-start it.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.967
- I mean, we don't even know
if these batteries are charged.

19:46.010 --> 19:48.012
And the runway's not plowed.

19:48.056 --> 19:50.319
With that kind of drag, we might
not be able to take off.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.278
- One way to find out.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.280
Park break?
- Set.

19:54.323 --> 19:55.846
- Battery voltage?

19:57.326 --> 19:59.285
- 23 volts.
- Levers?

19:59.328 --> 20:03.376
- Cut off, forward, flight idle.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.682
- Before start checklist
complete.

20:05.726 --> 20:06.988
[sighing]

20:07.031 --> 20:08.337
- We only have one shot.

20:08.381 --> 20:10.209
After this, the 12 volts
will be drained.

20:11.819 --> 20:12.863
Clear right?

20:13.734 --> 20:15.170
- Clear right.

20:19.043 --> 20:21.089
We have power. 12 %.

20:24.745 --> 20:27.008
If we hit the red line, there's
no grace period here, Bodie.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.618
We'll need to abort,
or we'll torch the engine.

20:28.662 --> 20:29.793
- Just hold a little longer.

20:31.055 --> 20:32.274
[engine whirring]

20:32.318 --> 20:33.754
- Bodie...

20:36.409 --> 20:37.888
- Hold steady.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.502
- Bodie...

20:42.545 --> 20:45.505
[engine revving]

20:46.941 --> 20:49.248
[chuckling]

20:50.249 --> 20:52.163
- Okay, I appreciate the help.

20:52.207 --> 20:53.643
But are you sure
you wanna do this?

20:54.731 --> 20:56.690
We might not even make
it off the runway.

20:56.733 --> 20:59.997
We could overshoot into
the trees, end up like Wheezer.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.522
Look, this is my risk.
I'm taking it, but...

21:02.565 --> 21:04.263
But you don't have to.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.268
- Let's do it.

21:14.447 --> 21:16.318
- Let's get out of here.

21:21.018 --> 21:23.064
- I know you're off duty.

21:23.107 --> 21:25.588
But I just got a call
from Randy Jacobs.

21:25.632 --> 21:28.243
He's a 60-year-old patient
with a history of epilepsy,

21:28.287 --> 21:30.158
and it sounds like he has
a nasty dog bite.

21:30.201 --> 21:32.813
It would be great to
get him on Tristan's flight
when he goes back,

21:32.856 --> 21:34.510
before the huge snow storm
rolls in.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.207
- And you want me
to go pick up Randy.

21:36.251 --> 21:37.992
- There's already a driver
on the way.

21:38.035 --> 21:38.949
- Hmm...

21:38.993 --> 21:41.343
[wind howling]

21:41.387 --> 21:42.953
- Hey, Emma.

21:42.997 --> 21:44.694
[speaking Nêhiyawwin]

21:46.479 --> 21:48.002
[wind howling]

21:48.045 --> 21:50.134
[Crystal]: We're not getting
your truck out of the ditch,

21:50.178 --> 21:52.311
and we're still an hour from
the nursing station.

21:52.702 --> 21:55.879
- Don't worry. Get yourself
a tow outta the ditch.

21:57.011 --> 21:59.535
Your truck'll be good as new.
[grunting]

21:59.579 --> 22:01.624
- There won't be any tow
coming tonight.

22:02.059 --> 22:04.235
You know, we're lucky
we were close to the shack.

22:04.279 --> 22:07.021
- Anybody passing the road,
they'll stop and see my truck,

22:07.064 --> 22:08.762
and come help.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.721
[sighing]
Hopefully.

22:14.115 --> 22:16.247
Okay, well I'm gonna go find
some firewood.

22:22.166 --> 22:26.954
- Nasty bite.
What happened?

22:27.258 --> 22:29.739
- I had Milroy since
he was a pup.

22:31.219 --> 22:33.134
Whenever I had a seizure,

22:33.177 --> 22:34.788
he'd lay down next to me

22:34.831 --> 22:37.268
and he'd be there when
I'd wake up.

22:40.968 --> 22:43.318
Never thought I'd have
to put him down.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.321
- I don't like the look
of this, Randy.

22:47.148 --> 22:48.671
We need to keep an eye
on the red parts,

22:48.715 --> 22:51.108
make sure it doesn't spread,
okay?

22:55.286 --> 22:58.072
How you holding up, Randy?
- It hurts.

22:58.115 --> 23:01.075
- You've got cellulitis.
It's spreading fast.

23:01.118 --> 23:03.207
That can happen sometimes
with animal bites.

23:03.773 --> 23:06.341
You need antibiotics
to prevent sepsis.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.866
- Doesn't seem like I'm getting
that any time soon.

23:10.606 --> 23:13.304
[wind howling]

23:13.348 --> 23:15.785
[Crystal]: Okay, let's lay
you down.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.788
[panting]

23:18.832 --> 23:21.530
- I, uh, found some stuff
in my truck

23:21.574 --> 23:23.140
I was gonna donate
to the community centre,

23:23.184 --> 23:26.187
but maybe there's some stuff
we could burn in here, you know?

23:31.410 --> 23:33.629
- None of this will
burn for long.

23:33.673 --> 23:36.023
Where's one of your black
and yellow boxes of supplies

23:36.066 --> 23:37.894
when we need it?

23:37.938 --> 23:40.027
- I don't do that anymore.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.378
- The pills?

23:43.422 --> 23:44.466
- Any of it.

23:47.991 --> 23:50.211
- We can burn the boxes for now.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.607
Treasure Island?

23:55.825 --> 23:57.610
You kept this?

23:58.480 --> 23:59.916
- I like pirates, you know?

23:59.960 --> 24:01.527
[chuckling]

24:01.570 --> 24:03.354
You liked it, too.
You used to read it to me

24:03.398 --> 24:05.792
in the canoe when you were
trying to get out of paddling.

24:05.835 --> 24:07.750
[laughing]
- I loved this book!

24:07.794 --> 24:11.145
Stories like this reminded
me of the adventures

24:11.188 --> 24:12.842
we used to have in the bush.

24:13.669 --> 24:18.805
Camping, or afternoons
in the canoe in the sun.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.247
Paper burns.

24:26.290 --> 24:29.380
- No, no, no, not that.
Not this one.

24:31.818 --> 24:33.907
This one. We'll burn this.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.483
[fire crackling]

24:54.536 --> 24:55.798
It's good, huh?

24:56.538 --> 24:58.540
See, not everything
from your past is horrible.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.411
- Who said it was?

25:02.413 --> 25:03.763
[scoffing]

25:05.547 --> 25:07.897
- I don't know why
you're so hard on who you
used to be, Flipper.

25:07.941 --> 25:11.379
You were...
You were pretty great.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.295
- What's wrong with
who I am now?

25:15.557 --> 25:19.430
- Well, you just don't seem
very... happy.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.173
You're always so serious
all the time now.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.395
Or maybe that's just
when I'm around.

25:30.093 --> 25:33.444
I'm gonna go on the land
for a while. I think I need it.

25:33.488 --> 25:35.403
And besides, people
in the community,

25:35.446 --> 25:37.231
they don't need my kind
of help.

25:43.890 --> 25:46.153
- What happened to the Oxy?
- Burned it.

25:48.459 --> 25:50.984
I don't care what those people
do to me,

25:51.027 --> 25:53.160
I'm not letting any more
of that shit come up here.

25:57.817 --> 25:59.645
- You should've told me, Jer.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.865
We could've figured
something out.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.215
- Would we?

26:05.651 --> 26:07.783
Or would you just have
blamed me for everything,

26:07.827 --> 26:09.437
just given me shit like always?

26:09.480 --> 26:11.134
[groaning]

26:12.309 --> 26:14.616
What's happening?
What's going on?

26:14.660 --> 26:15.748
- He's seizing

26:15.791 --> 26:17.227
[groaning]

26:18.794 --> 26:21.318
We need to keep him warm, okay?
He's getting too cold.

26:22.232 --> 26:24.539
Get him on his side. Come on.

26:28.978 --> 26:30.501
Okay.

26:34.070 --> 26:35.855
- You're gonna hate me
for saying it, but...

26:37.247 --> 26:39.336
I'll be the peanut butter.

27:01.881 --> 27:04.361
- Maskwa doesn't blame you,
you know.

27:06.581 --> 27:07.843
- He should.

27:09.889 --> 27:11.455
- Jeremy...

27:23.554 --> 27:26.775
- Hey, what are you doing?
Crys...

27:32.999 --> 27:36.306
- Dumb to hold on to the past
so much that we freeze
to death now.

27:44.401 --> 27:47.100
We're not going to survive
in this much longer.

27:49.058 --> 27:53.280
- Just stay awake.
Just try to stay awake.

27:53.802 --> 27:56.587
[shivering]

28:05.988 --> 28:08.121
[man on radio]: It may just
be flurries out there now,

28:08.164 --> 28:11.559
but don't be fooled. We are
in for a big one tonight, folks,

28:11.602 --> 28:13.909
with a heavy snowfall warning
in effect.

28:13.953 --> 28:16.129
[sighing]

28:16.782 --> 28:21.003
- Since our unspoken
agreement apparently needs
to be spoken,

28:21.047 --> 28:23.223
I really hoped you wouldn't come
here when I'm working.

28:23.266 --> 28:25.660
- Is there another waitress?

28:25.704 --> 28:27.531
- No, I sent everybody home.

28:27.575 --> 28:31.666
Place is dead with the storm
coming, and I need the money,
so...

28:35.191 --> 28:37.498
- I'll have a cup of coffee
and go, I just...

28:37.846 --> 28:39.587
need a minute.

28:40.806 --> 28:45.332
- Fine. Get it yourself.
My back's killing me.

28:48.248 --> 28:51.338
[music playing softly]

29:01.304 --> 29:03.480
- Tradition.
[chuckling]

29:03.524 --> 29:05.700
My brother and I would order
one of each,

29:05.744 --> 29:07.876
then take turns stealing from
each other's plates.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.792
He always said that life's
too short,

29:10.836 --> 29:12.663
eat dessert first.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.363
- I'm sorry.

29:16.406 --> 29:17.581
- Oh, no, no, no, hey.

29:17.625 --> 29:20.323
My brother's still alive but,
uh...

29:20.846 --> 29:23.109
He just isn't talking to me
right now.

29:23.152 --> 29:25.502
Anyone ever tells you
they're thinking about

29:25.546 --> 29:27.678
getting back together
with their ex,

29:27.722 --> 29:31.030
don't tell them what you really
think. That was last fall.

29:31.073 --> 29:32.771
- You must miss him.

29:33.859 --> 29:36.687
- Snowmobile trip
isn't the same by myself.

29:36.731 --> 29:38.951
- Have you tried calling him?

29:39.952 --> 29:42.519
- It's kinda hard
to break the ice, you know?

29:43.912 --> 29:45.696
Things change fast, man.

29:45.740 --> 29:49.048
Somebody who was
in your life all this time
can suddenly just...

29:50.310 --> 29:52.486
be gone.

29:52.529 --> 29:54.183
Like a bolt of lightning.

29:54.227 --> 29:56.098
[man on radio]: The roads
are really bad out there, folks.

29:56.142 --> 29:58.057
There is a multi-vehicle
pile-up in town,

29:58.100 --> 29:59.972
not to mention all the cars
that are off the road.

30:00.015 --> 30:02.278
I would say don't go out unless
you absolutely have to.

30:02.322 --> 30:03.889
- Hey, you should probably
head out.

30:03.932 --> 30:06.195
You wait much longer, your car
won't be able to make it out.

30:06.239 --> 30:08.545
- Oh, yeah, thanks.

30:16.553 --> 30:18.904
[door opening and closing]

30:20.993 --> 30:22.298
Mitosis?

30:23.734 --> 30:26.694
- Yeah. I'm applying
to a phlebotomy program.

30:26.737 --> 30:31.090
It's good money.
I'll be able to take care
of myself and the baby.

30:33.048 --> 30:35.355
I didn't take high school Bio,
so I'm making it up.

30:35.398 --> 30:37.444
- No yeah, that's...
that's great.

30:38.053 --> 30:39.881
People will always need
blood taken.

30:39.925 --> 30:43.798
- I know you think
I'm some dumb local girl.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.409
- I don't think you're dumb.

30:47.497 --> 30:50.849
I used to think
we could be friends, actually.

30:51.414 --> 30:54.461
- Yeah, if by friends
you mean...

30:54.504 --> 30:55.810
[water pouring]

30:55.854 --> 30:58.160
- Uh... Oh, God.
- Are you okay?

30:58.204 --> 31:02.251
- No. I just... peed my pants.

31:02.295 --> 31:03.949
- Has the pain
been coming in waves?

31:05.211 --> 31:06.908
You've been having contractions.

31:06.952 --> 31:10.564
- I'm only 28 weeks, the baby's
not due for another two months!

31:10.607 --> 31:12.609
- No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

31:12.653 --> 31:14.916
I saw this all
the time at Sinai.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.571
Uh, you need to go to
the hospital for antibiotics,

31:17.614 --> 31:19.486
tocolytics, and a shot
of steroids.

31:19.529 --> 31:22.271
- What will that do?
- The steroids will help
the baby's lungs mature,

31:22.315 --> 31:25.405
fast but the tocolytics
might be able to stop
the premature labour

31:25.448 --> 31:27.711
and give baby more time inside
to grow and develop.

31:27.755 --> 31:28.843
- Okay...

31:29.626 --> 31:32.020
Can you... drive me?

31:32.064 --> 31:33.761
- I'm not sure my car
will make it.

31:33.804 --> 31:35.415
Um, I'll call an ambulance.

31:38.026 --> 31:40.115
[phone ringing tone]

31:40.811 --> 31:42.422
[dial tone]

31:43.902 --> 31:46.295
- The radio said there
was a big pile-up in town.

31:48.819 --> 31:51.779
- It's okay. We'll, um...
time your contractions.

31:51.822 --> 31:55.870
Most primip labour takes hours,
so we've got time.

31:56.349 --> 32:00.179
- What happens if we can't make
it to the hospital? Could I...

32:00.222 --> 32:01.397
The baby.

32:02.833 --> 32:06.576
- Look, I have never lost
a patient.

32:06.620 --> 32:09.057
Not in L&D,
not flying medevacs.

32:09.101 --> 32:10.580
You're in good hands,
okay?

32:12.495 --> 32:14.454
[tense music]

32:14.497 --> 32:16.978
[groaning]

32:17.022 --> 32:18.588
Ten minutes apart.

32:20.503 --> 32:22.288
[phone ringing tone]

32:22.331 --> 32:24.812
[Bodie]: Hayley?
- Bodie! Um...

32:24.855 --> 32:27.336
can you come get me and Madison
from the Whiskey Hatch?

32:27.380 --> 32:29.817
We need to get to a hospital.
- Hayley, I can't hear you.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.602
- Bodie, we need your truck.
Madison's in labour.

32:32.646 --> 32:34.604
Bodie, can you hear me?

32:34.648 --> 32:36.606
[phone beeping]
Shit!

32:36.650 --> 32:38.347
- Oh, God.

32:39.740 --> 32:42.961
- Okay, um, try standing
with your feet apart,

32:43.004 --> 32:44.701
bent over the bar like this.

32:44.745 --> 32:46.529
Some women find it helps.

32:46.573 --> 32:48.836
You know, this is usually
when I suggest

32:48.879 --> 32:51.795
the birthing partner rubs
Mama's back.

32:51.839 --> 32:55.016
- Yeah, well, just another thing
I'll have to do for myself.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.497
[sighing]

32:58.324 --> 33:01.718
- Have you tried talking
to Bodie?

33:05.374 --> 33:07.986
- He's, uh, tried calling.

33:10.031 --> 33:13.078
Says he wants to help me
and the baby.

33:13.556 --> 33:18.083
But... I have to be able to take
care of myself.

33:18.735 --> 33:21.129
Even if we make up now,

33:21.173 --> 33:23.914
I could still end up raising
this baby on my own later.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.655
[breathing deeply]

33:25.699 --> 33:28.136
Thought I'd have a couple
more months, though.

33:28.180 --> 33:31.879
It's so weird
to love someone

33:31.922 --> 33:35.143
that you've never met
before so much.

33:36.231 --> 33:39.930
I already love this baby
more than anyone.

33:40.931 --> 33:43.847
I just want him to be okay

33:43.891 --> 33:46.633
[breathing deeply]

33:55.729 --> 33:58.253
- I had an appointment

33:58.297 --> 34:00.299
with my oncologist
in Winnipeg this morning.

34:03.302 --> 34:05.130
They found...

34:07.219 --> 34:10.004
precancerous shadows
on my MRI.

34:12.311 --> 34:17.359
She suggested a preventative
double mastectomy.

34:18.752 --> 34:21.059
- What are you going to do?

34:26.455 --> 34:28.718
- I mean, your whole life,
this giant decision

34:28.762 --> 34:30.894
gets reduced to probabilities.

34:32.983 --> 34:35.247
Chances that something bad
might happen,

34:35.290 --> 34:38.119
like a bomb that might go off,
or lightning that might strike.

34:38.163 --> 34:40.382
And-- You know, and I'm 25?

34:42.819 --> 34:47.128
And this is my body, and
I'm just so... I'm so angry.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.782
I'm angry that my mom died,

34:48.825 --> 34:50.958
I'm angry that I have to make
this big decision,

34:51.001 --> 34:52.220
and I'm just...

34:52.264 --> 34:53.700
[sighing]

35:02.012 --> 35:04.102
I think that's why I slept
with Bodie.

35:11.239 --> 35:12.719
- It still wasn't right.

35:12.762 --> 35:14.590
- No.

35:17.637 --> 35:19.247
[groaning]

35:26.863 --> 35:28.561
Okay.

35:30.519 --> 35:32.042
Madison, I wouldn't usually
recommend doing this outside
of a hospital,

35:32.086 --> 35:33.914
but I think I need to give
you a vaginal exam

35:33.957 --> 35:35.481
to see how much time we have.

35:35.524 --> 35:36.917
[sighing]

35:37.439 --> 35:39.833
- Whatever the baby needs.

35:41.051 --> 35:42.488
- You're five centimetres.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.839
- Okay. That's not so far,
right?

35:45.882 --> 35:47.841
I need to get all the way to 10?

35:47.884 --> 35:49.973
- With a preemie,
it's not uncommon to deliver

35:50.017 --> 35:51.323
at seven or eight centimetres.

35:51.366 --> 35:53.151
And you're progressing fast.

35:53.194 --> 35:55.588
- But... what about his lungs?

35:55.631 --> 35:57.242
You said he needed steroids
or else

35:57.285 --> 35:59.374
his lungs won't be developed
enough yet, right?

35:59.418 --> 36:00.810
And you never lost a patient,

36:00.854 --> 36:03.204
you can deliver my baby here,
can't you?

36:03.248 --> 36:04.379
- Madison, I--
[Mike]: Whew!

36:04.423 --> 36:07.426
That is a storm!

36:09.732 --> 36:11.212
What kind of night
have you had?
