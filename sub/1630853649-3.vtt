- Thank you.
- Madam Secretary.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.657
- Good morning.
- Madam Secretary.

02:38.409 --> 02:42.288
I've devoted my career
to reducing casualties

02:42.371 --> 02:43.747
and improving mental health

02:43.831 --> 02:45.416
in the armed services.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.252
But while we're achieving
success with our conventional

02:48.335 --> 02:51.672
forces, the physical
and psychological burden

02:51.755 --> 02:53.716
is falling
on the Spec Ops community

02:53.799 --> 02:57.094
to a degree that feels...
unsustainable.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.847
Much as we'd like
our elite warriors

02:59.930 --> 03:03.017
to be machines, they are not.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.436
We are going to overhaul
our budget request

03:05.519 --> 03:07.062
before it goes
to appropriations.

03:07.146 --> 03:08.397
Uh, overhaul in what capacity?

03:08.480 --> 03:11.650
Significant reductions
in lifetime deployments

03:11.734 --> 03:13.152
for our special operators.

03:13.235 --> 03:16.488
- So, recalculating allowances?
- No.

03:16.572 --> 03:18.866
I'm talking hard caps.
Mandatory retirements.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.285
We can't keep riding them
till there's nothing left.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.579
We'll be facing a significant
degradation in readiness.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.540
- And the financial
implication...
- We'll find acceptable levels.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.919
We've been working
on the budget since June, ma'am.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.837
You're suggesting we restructure
in a matter of days?

03:31.921 --> 03:34.465
All right. Call home,
let your families know

03:34.548 --> 03:36.175
they're running solo
the next few nights.

03:36.258 --> 03:39.428
These operators give their
whole lives to fight for us.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.805
We can give up a weekend
to fight for them.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.307
Let's go.

03:50.481 --> 03:52.441
This is about James Reece,
isn't it?

03:53.484 --> 03:55.694
He's one data point.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.932
♪ ♪

04:38.028 --> 04:40.030
Yeah, so, if we don't get
this done in the next 12 hours,

04:40.114 --> 04:41.198
BuzzFeed is gonna beat us to it,

04:41.281 --> 04:42.700
and it's gonna be
fucking embarrassing.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.451
I'm sorry, guys. I have
another meeting, but thank you.

04:44.535 --> 04:45.828
Get to it. Good job.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.705
Thank you, okay?

04:55.838 --> 04:57.548
How could they miss this?

04:57.631 --> 05:00.092
I spoke with
a Dr. Russell in Incirlik.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.635
Apparently he pressed
for more testing,

05:01.719 --> 05:03.470
but Reece
checked himself out A.M.A.

05:03.554 --> 05:05.597
Said he had to be back
for the funerals.

05:05.681 --> 05:07.558
- Wait, so no one in the Navy
has seen this.
- Yeah, they got

05:07.641 --> 05:09.476
this guy running around,
leading a platoon,

05:09.560 --> 05:11.228
and his medicals are optional?

05:11.311 --> 05:12.604
That's absolute negligence.

05:12.688 --> 05:15.024
Okay.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.734
So what now?

05:16.817 --> 05:18.485
Well, Reece wants to meet.
I want to know why.

05:18.569 --> 05:19.987
Either way,
I'll have something set

05:20.070 --> 05:21.071
to drop later this evening.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.156
All right.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.365
Are you being safe on this?

05:23.449 --> 05:24.742
I was on the ground

05:24.825 --> 05:25.993
in Sirte when they came
for Gaddhafi.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.453
I think I got this.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.539
Maybe I come with you.

05:30.622 --> 05:33.125
And we never see
or hear from Reece again?

05:33.208 --> 05:34.752
No.

All right, Reece,
why did you want to meet?

07:08.345 --> 07:10.806
Have you ever heard
of Saul Agnon?

07:10.889 --> 07:13.767
Or a company called
Capstone Industries?

07:13.851 --> 07:15.102
Hi, guys.
May I take your order?

07:15.185 --> 07:16.645
Uh, yeah.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.690
I'll have the little gems
and the striped bass.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.024
- Of course.
- Nothing for me, thank you.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.152

07:23.235 --> 07:25.445
Of course, right away.

07:25.529 --> 07:26.947
Capstone Industries?

07:27.030 --> 07:29.700
Kind of place that only has
a logo on their website.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.452
Agnon, he's the VP
of Asset Management.

07:32.536 --> 07:35.247
I did a little research
of my own, and all their market

07:35.330 --> 07:36.790
investments,
it's, it's, it's fluff.

07:36.874 --> 07:40.002
It's Carnival Cruise Lines,
Planet Fitness, H&M...

07:40.085 --> 07:42.546
Wait, so now the backers of
Planet Fitness are involved?

07:42.629 --> 07:43.964
Just listen.

07:44.047 --> 07:47.718
The point being,
they have an investment pool

07:47.801 --> 07:49.803
of $60 billion.

07:49.887 --> 07:52.431
That's way more than can be
accounted for in public holding.

07:52.514 --> 07:53.807
Well, where do
they have the remainder?

07:53.891 --> 07:56.393
That's what we need to find out.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.063
What about the Iranians?

08:00.147 --> 08:02.608
It was never about Kahani.
He was, he was top-shelf bait.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.318
This...

08:04.401 --> 08:06.111
it's something domestic.

08:06.195 --> 08:07.988
Something corporate.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.615
And it's not over.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.622
This lead on Capstone,
where did it come from?

08:16.705 --> 08:18.582
- Not important.
- It's important, actually.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.459
If I'm gonna run with
information, I need to know

08:20.542 --> 08:22.836
that I can trust the source.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.172
I'm the source.

08:31.428 --> 08:34.139
There's something
I need to show you.

08:34.223 --> 08:36.975
Um... I pulled this
from the Engram Clinic.

08:37.059 --> 08:39.102
I didn't want to show it to you

08:39.186 --> 08:41.772
until I had some context.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.158
It's a tumor, Reece.

08:53.242 --> 08:56.370
It's, um,
about the size of a walnut.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.455
It's on the node between

08:58.538 --> 09:00.916
the hippocampus
and the amygdala.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.751
I spoke with a neurologist,
and she said

09:02.834 --> 09:05.545
that symptoms would
include headaches...

09:06.588 --> 09:08.966
...paranoia, memory confusion.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.263
That's not me.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.723
It's time-stamped
to your arrival at the clinic.

09:16.807 --> 09:17.891
Did NCIS give this to you?

09:17.975 --> 09:20.978
No. Holder never mentioned it.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.230
Right now, I'm pretty sure that
we're the only ones who know.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.816
The neurologist recommended
biopsy.

09:25.899 --> 09:29.486
Without that, there's no way
to accurately diagnose.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.947
And, um, we both know
that you've

09:32.030 --> 09:34.700
been having
confabulatory episodes.

09:34.783 --> 09:37.077
That's not something
that you could explain

09:37.160 --> 09:41.039
with, uh, Jahan Kahani
or with Capstone.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.126
Look in the mirror behind you.
There's a man,

09:44.209 --> 09:45.544
brown cap, wrap-around shades.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.130
- You see him?
- No.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.007
There's just some people
finishing their lunch.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.092
We got to go. Now.

09:52.175 --> 09:55.053
Wait, Reece! Hey.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.722
You have to...

10:05.439 --> 10:07.691
Reece! Reece, wait!

10:07.774 --> 10:09.401
Did you bring your smartphone?

10:09.484 --> 10:11.069
No. Just the burner.
What's going on?

10:11.153 --> 10:13.864
They have eyes in the sky.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.825
- You mean like a drone?
- The man that I just saw
is an operator.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.785
Now, he's either here for me...

10:18.869 --> 10:20.203
or for you.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.622
Reece, there's nobody there.
You're imagining things.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.708
I ran an SDR to get here.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.418
The only way they could've
tracked me is with UAV.

10:26.501 --> 10:27.836
Hold.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.591
This is my ride. Get in.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.468
Get in!

10:37.554 --> 10:39.348
Buckle up.

10:39.431 --> 10:40.891
I'm sorry, we're running away
because you think

10:40.974 --> 10:43.352
you saw a guy
in wrap-around shades?

10:43.435 --> 10:45.437
We're not running.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.066
Hold on.

10:53.904 --> 10:55.781
Stay here.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.657
You okay, buddy?
I didn't see you there.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.913
Read that.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.748
Open it!

11:46.832 --> 11:49.584
That's a professional
target package.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.171
Still think I'm losing my mind?

12:21.908 --> 12:24.202
- We need to tell
the police what happened.
- No cops.

12:24.286 --> 12:26.371
Reece, that guy came
at you in broad daylight.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.915
NCIS is compromised.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.876
Maybe elements in PD,
we can't be sure.

12:30.959 --> 12:33.086
Right now,
we need to get off the grid.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.891
You know how
to use one of these?

12:45.974 --> 12:48.226
Yeah.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.811
Can't be sure
if you're a known quantity.

12:49.895 --> 12:51.438
You need to lay low
until this thing blows over.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.731
Do you have a place to go?

12:55.525 --> 12:57.903
- Do you?
- Yeah.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.121
I'm sorry I got you into this.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.956
You won't see me again.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.333

13:14.336 --> 13:16.796

you and your men, I'll find it.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.534
- What the fuck was that,
Hargrove?
- Sir?

15:09.618 --> 15:11.620
You were on the door.
You should have taken the room.

18:25.021 --> 18:28.900
Look, it's time
to focus now, Saul, okay?

18:28.983 --> 18:31.861
The Plano deal has to make.
It has to.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.113
Capstone has sunk
too much money into Nubellum.

18:34.197 --> 18:35.740
The time to sell
is right now.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.283
I'm sick of waiting
for Elias Ryberg

18:37.367 --> 18:39.285
to grow some nuts,
and I need you there.

18:39.369 --> 18:41.412
Okay?

18:41.496 --> 18:43.081
You're my closer.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.086
Kurt, send Janet in.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.687
- Oh.
- You should come to bed.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.900
I can't. I have homework.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.985
Hmm.

19:56.613 --> 19:58.698
WARCOM's got you...

19:58.781 --> 20:01.159
jumping over bonfires now?

20:01.242 --> 20:03.786
That's a Zoroastrian
new year celebration, Newroz.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.998
Well, I can see how that's
operationally relevant.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.335
They got us tagged
to the Syrian Defense Force.

20:10.418 --> 20:13.046
Got to learn a thing or two
about Kurdistan.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.255
She's kicking.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.967
Is she?

20:19.344 --> 20:20.845
Wait a minute.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.889
Oh...

20:24.891 --> 20:27.060
- Daddy's little ass-kicker.
- No.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.978
She gets her ass-kicking
from her mama.

20:31.940 --> 20:34.776
You know if you get stuck
out there, I'll be okay.

20:35.777 --> 20:38.029
My mom and dad will
come down and help.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.117
If I do make it back,

20:43.201 --> 20:44.869
then I'll probably
just go fishing, I guess.

20:47.205 --> 20:49.666
Even if I have
to liberate a bird...

20:49.749 --> 20:52.418
and fly myself home,
I'm gonna be here.

20:52.502 --> 20:55.046
I'll be holding
your hand the whole way.

20:55.129 --> 20:57.590
Well, I guess then I'll be
the only girl with a doula

20:57.674 --> 20:59.759
- coming straight
from the sandbox.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.851
Oh...

21:20.321 --> 21:22.699
Is she going to be okay, Daddy?

21:22.782 --> 21:25.702
Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.
She's just, she's stunned.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.620
She's gonna, she's gonna
fly back to her family.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.601
Coming at you.

21:50.685 --> 21:52.729
Oh, thank you.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.814
Yeah.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.651
Oh, I see you've sprung
for the honeymoon suite.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.363
Mm. All right. You were right.

22:02.447 --> 22:05.366
NCIS put a BOLO out last night.

22:05.450 --> 22:08.036
So, if I were you,
I wouldn't go home anytime soon.

22:08.119 --> 22:10.204
Oh, and that, uh,
your shooter in L.A.?

22:10.288 --> 22:12.373
Locals ID'd him
as Adrian Gordonis.

22:12.457 --> 22:14.125
Former MARSOC, or Raiders,

22:14.208 --> 22:16.169
or whatever the fuck
they're calling themselves now.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.546
Went private
with Talos Tactical.

22:19.630 --> 22:22.050
I haven't dealt with them
directly, but I think it's safe

22:22.133 --> 22:24.969
to say they don't operate
with a moral fucking compass.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.638
Jesus fuck.
Like, just take a breath.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.392
I don't think the burrito's
going anywhere, brother.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.895
I didn't get my bucatini, man.

22:33.978 --> 22:35.438
I don't know what that means.

22:36.481 --> 22:37.982
It means thank you
for this burrito.

22:38.066 --> 22:39.859
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

22:54.332 --> 22:56.959
Luce.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.378
She had some skills, huh?

22:59.462 --> 23:02.215
Yeah. She could sing, too.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.300
And hold a barre chord.

23:09.097 --> 23:11.599
Yeah, she was
something, brother.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.819
You know, for the life of me,
I can't remember the day

23:22.902 --> 23:24.070
she drew this picture.

23:25.154 --> 23:27.448
Bro, I don't remember
last Sunday.

23:29.659 --> 23:31.828
It was the morning
before Syria, I think.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.622
And, uh...

23:34.705 --> 23:36.415
there was a bird.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.417
A starling, maybe?

23:38.501 --> 23:40.586
Cracked into the window,
killed itself.

23:40.670 --> 23:43.256
- Sounds like your memory's
spot on.
- Mmm.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.007
It's there, but only half there.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.801
The other parts...

23:46.884 --> 23:48.886
it's fucking... it's muddled.

23:52.557 --> 23:55.143
Mixed with other memories,
it's like...

23:55.226 --> 23:58.187
like looking
through a kaleidoscope.

23:59.814 --> 24:02.775
Well, you did
get fucking rocked.

24:02.859 --> 24:05.069
I mean, you still getting
those headaches, huh?

24:09.448 --> 24:11.450
No.

24:14.829 --> 24:17.331
- Did you see
the target package?
- Yeah.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.209
Yeah.

24:20.293 --> 24:21.919
I mean...

24:22.003 --> 24:23.754
looks like a complete asshole.

24:23.838 --> 24:25.756
You see his little fucking dog?

24:27.758 --> 24:29.260
I mean, what I'm saying is,
I don't really get

24:29.343 --> 24:31.012
a mastermind vibe with this guy.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.556
Yeah. I didn't think so, either.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.558
I'm also gonna take
a dive into Capstone.

24:35.641 --> 24:38.352
We could, but I do already
have someone working on it.

24:38.436 --> 24:40.354
There's a journalist.

24:40.438 --> 24:41.981
And she can help me
do some research

24:42.064 --> 24:43.399
without raising suspicion.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.484
- Journal?
- Yeah.

24:45.568 --> 24:48.321
Hmm. That's good to know.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.449
She know you're here?

24:51.532 --> 24:53.409
- No.
- She know I'm here?

24:53.492 --> 24:56.495
- Of course not.
- You do know you're not
the only one on the line, right?

24:56.579 --> 24:58.289
That I am fucking CIA,
and if it gets out that

24:58.372 --> 25:00.750
- you're trying to fucking
wage your own war...
- I understand.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.793
- ...in the streets of L.A....
- I'm telling you,

25:02.877 --> 25:04.879
you're clean. I promise you.

25:06.130 --> 25:08.591
You're good. She's an asset.

25:09.634 --> 25:11.886
I know what category
to put her in.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.888
And there's never been
an obligation.

25:13.971 --> 25:16.349
- If you need to walk, I get it.
- Fuck you, I'm not walking.

25:16.432 --> 25:20.603
This isn't an obligation
for me, brother.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.481
I just need to know
we have each other's backs.

25:23.564 --> 25:26.192
- That's it.
- Always.

25:27.652 --> 25:29.654
All right.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.784
All right.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.245

of fucking people

25:37.328 --> 25:40.665
tracking you right now,
so just lay low, please.

25:42.917 --> 25:45.336
- That's what I'm talking about,
all right.
- I'm chilling.

I'll buzz you.

I'm not talking
about harassment.

positioned to buy
Mike's company.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.128
We'll make you a hell of a deal
on Nubellum.

27:09.211 --> 27:10.796
Capstone Industries?

27:10.880 --> 27:12.423
- You're on deck.
- Hey, excellent.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.425
Uh, do we know
who we're paired with yet?

27:14.508 --> 27:16.052
I asked for Bryson DeChambeau.

You are with Steve Davey.

27:28.856 --> 27:30.858
And now teeing off

27:30.941 --> 27:33.277

28:06.060 --> 28:07.812
I'm not ashamed
to admit we considered

28:07.895 --> 28:10.648
very seriously
an offer six years ago.

28:10.731 --> 28:11.899
I had no idea.

28:11.982 --> 28:13.651
Your work has always
been very impressive.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.653
I really
appreciate that.

28:15.736 --> 28:17.780
Before Capstone took us
into military contracts,

28:17.863 --> 28:20.074
I had a different plan
for Nubellum.

28:20.157 --> 28:22.159
And if this sale goes through,

28:22.243 --> 28:23.536
maybe we can explore
that original concept.

28:23.619 --> 28:26.497
There he goes! Getting excited.

28:27.498 --> 28:30.084
The thing about visionaries...

28:30.167 --> 28:33.254
they see an endless
spectrum of possibilities.

28:33.337 --> 28:36.424
Our job as partners, as patrons,

28:36.507 --> 28:39.844
has been to narrow
that band just a bit.

28:39.927 --> 28:41.887
Once Capstone came on board,

28:41.971 --> 28:43.931
once Steve started steering

28:44.014 --> 28:47.309
the ship, well,
that's why we're here, isn't it?

28:47.393 --> 28:48.894

28:58.112 --> 29:00.114
Mr. Agnon,
I appreciate your perseverance,

Social. Mm-hmm. Okay.

29:06.287 --> 29:07.872
How about this?

29:09.039 --> 29:11.709
I rented a house off the 16th.

29:11.792 --> 29:14.295
How about I drum up
a little soirée tonight?

48:21.357 --> 48:23.443
He, uh, understands people,

48:23.526 --> 48:26.654
markets, war.

48:28.990 --> 48:31.743
I-I'm just an appendage.

48:31.826 --> 48:35.079
A go-between. I resolve things.

48:36.789 --> 48:38.958
How does Steve execute
an ambush in Syria?

48:39.042 --> 48:41.669
Steve has friends everywhere.

48:41.753 --> 48:43.963
Perks of being a billionaire.

48:44.047 --> 48:45.673
- What was his objective?
- Look, that's...

48:45.757 --> 48:48.509
that's not my department,
but, um...

48:48.593 --> 48:51.179
it's all
about something called, uh...

48:53.181 --> 48:56.059
...Project RD-4895.

48:56.142 --> 48:59.604
- What's that?
- RD-4895.

48:59.687 --> 49:03.066
But I'm telling you,
I don't know what it is.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.569
I-I-I just know
that it's worth a...

49:06.653 --> 49:08.821
a lot of money.

49:10.031 --> 49:12.033
That's not good enough.

49:14.577 --> 49:16.954
No! Come on! Come on!

49:17.038 --> 49:19.248
Listen, man,
I'm telling you, man!

49:19.332 --> 49:21.000
I don't know anything!

49:21.084 --> 49:22.877
I'm just a guy!
You said it yourself!

49:22.960 --> 49:24.712
I'm just a fucking guy!

49:34.931 --> 49:36.474
All right.

49:36.557 --> 49:38.476
All right, I believe you.

49:40.019 --> 49:42.313
Steve Horn calls the shots
and you are

49:42.397 --> 49:44.273
- his little errand bitch.
- Yes!

49:44.357 --> 49:46.025
- Right.
- Yes! That's it.

49:46.109 --> 49:47.485
You don't make decisions.

49:47.568 --> 49:49.362
You didn't want any of this
to happen.

49:49.445 --> 49:51.614
I swear to Christ.

49:51.698 --> 49:53.282
Who did you send

49:53.366 --> 49:55.576
to kill my family?

49:57.412 --> 49:59.414
Hmm?

50:04.043 --> 50:05.670
Have a little more.

50:05.753 --> 50:07.755
I want to go home, man.

50:12.218 --> 50:14.220
I asked you a question.

50:22.979 --> 50:24.981
There's a...

50:27.024 --> 50:29.277
There's a lawyer
out of Jackson Hole.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.237
Marcus Boykin.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.990
He deals in black market
crude all over the globe,

50:34.073 --> 50:36.325
including Mexico.

50:36.409 --> 50:38.411
Mexico?

50:40.329 --> 50:42.999
Boykin hired sicarios.

50:43.082 --> 50:45.209
The triggerman.

50:45.293 --> 50:47.003
The one who got away.
Where do I find him?

50:47.086 --> 50:48.796
Fucking Mexico,
I just said that.

50:48.880 --> 50:51.174
- Be specific.
- "What's the address
of the sicario?"

50:51.257 --> 50:53.634
That's not
a fucking question you ask.

50:53.718 --> 50:55.636
- Does Boykin know?
- Boykin doesn't know shit.

50:55.720 --> 50:58.639
He knows routing numbers for...

51:00.725 --> 51:02.810
...incompetent fucking hit men.

51:04.228 --> 51:06.230
He's more useless than me.

51:12.028 --> 51:13.863
You know, downrange
we like to say

51:13.946 --> 51:15.406
that what we do is for freedom.

51:15.490 --> 51:17.909
But what it really is, Saul...

51:17.992 --> 51:20.453
There's evil...

51:20.536 --> 51:23.247
in this world.

51:23.331 --> 51:25.750
It's our job
to look it in the eye,

51:25.833 --> 51:27.543
'cause most folks
don't have the balls.

51:27.627 --> 51:29.504
That's the job. We do it.

51:29.587 --> 51:31.380
All you got to do
is pay your taxes

51:31.464 --> 51:33.508
and stay out of our way,
but you...

51:33.591 --> 51:35.635

51:35.718 --> 51:37.553
Steve Horn,

51:37.637 --> 51:40.890
Capstone Industries...

51:42.683 --> 51:44.685
...oh, you wanted
in on the fray.

51:45.853 --> 51:48.689
Now...
you're on the battlefield.

51:52.276 --> 51:55.238
This is a methadone cocktail,
Saul.

51:55.321 --> 51:57.490
You get a quiet death.

51:57.573 --> 51:59.575
And you're lucky.

52:00.701 --> 52:02.203
It's more than you deserve.

A little cabin

54:17.338 --> 54:18.756
Lauren had this plan.

54:18.839 --> 54:21.258
She was gonna train
athletes at altitude.

Lucy wanted to live somewhere

An assassination would
make waves.

If a combat veteran goes nuts,
