WEBVTT

00:07.572 --> 00:09.705
- The latest polls show Taft
has eaten away at our lead

00:09.748 --> 00:13.317
in several key states, so this
Julien situation is a problem.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.232
- "The Rock attacking
an average citizen" angle

00:15.276 --> 00:17.669
- is hurting us.
- I didn't attack Julien.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.497
I mean, come on.
I was just defending myself.

00:19.541 --> 00:21.064
If anything,
I was online bullied.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.110
- Hmm, I once played
an online bully

00:23.153 --> 00:24.676
in a Lars von Trier film.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.505
- We all have, Randall.
How's Tennessee lookin'?

00:27.549 --> 00:28.637
Not great.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.073
- I'm not losing
one of my home states.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.509
No, sir, you're not.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.511
We're going on the offensive
in Tennessee,

00:33.555 --> 00:35.513
starting with sending in
General Monica Jackson.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.254
- Oh, great.
Is she on the ground?

00:37.298 --> 00:38.995
- She's in Memphis
prepping her rally speech

00:39.039 --> 00:40.257
with Governor Juanita Patree.

00:40.301 --> 00:42.607
- And Monica and the governor
go way back.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.740
They were on the armed forces'
tae kwon do team together.

00:44.783 --> 00:47.482
- Hmm, Chang Hon style
or Songahm style?

00:47.525 --> 00:49.745
- I don't know.
Should I know that?

00:49.788 --> 00:51.007
- Mm-hmm.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.835
All right, brief me
on how the rally goes

00:52.878 --> 00:54.097
as soon as you have anything.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.664
Of course.

00:56.969 --> 00:58.536
That's a plus, huh,

00:58.580 --> 01:00.451
your vice presidential pick
being tight with the governor?

01:00.495 --> 01:02.714
- I trust Monica
to get the job done,

01:02.758 --> 01:04.716
and, you know, sometimes
the best way to solve a problem

01:04.760 --> 01:06.849
is to surround yourself
with the right people.

01:06.892 --> 01:08.024
Mm.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.460
Now, I know we're talking
Tennessee,

01:09.504 --> 01:11.680
but that reminds me
of the story you were telling

01:11.723 --> 01:13.856
about your mom stepping in
to help your grandmother

01:13.899 --> 01:15.162
run her business in Hawaii.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.511
Good callback, Randall.

01:16.554 --> 01:17.686
- I listen.

01:17.729 --> 01:20.428
- I mean,
what a crazy time that was.

01:20.471 --> 01:23.605
My grandmother was about to go
to trial on extortion charges,

01:23.648 --> 01:27.478
and she handed the reins over
to the best person for the job:

01:27.522 --> 01:28.914
Mama Rock.

01:28.958 --> 01:31.439
- Welcome to Honolulu
International Airport.

01:31.482 --> 01:34.746
We are days away
from the event of the summer:

01:34.790 --> 01:37.140
the Backyard Brawl-B-Q.

01:37.184 --> 01:39.577
In fact, let's bring in
two of the giants

01:39.621 --> 01:41.275
of professional wrestling
right now,

01:41.318 --> 01:42.754
the one and only Nature Boy,
Ric Flair,

01:42.798 --> 01:46.106
and the man from Mud Lick,
Kentucky, Hillbilly Jim.

01:46.149 --> 01:48.238
Aloha, fellas.
How was the flight?

01:48.282 --> 01:51.111
- Crazy, Gene.
The plane was so big.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.895
Bathrooms were so small.

01:52.938 --> 01:55.376
- I suppose better
than the alternative.

01:55.419 --> 01:57.160
- Ric, you're in Hawaii.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.075
- What's gonna happen?
- Woo!

01:59.119 --> 02:00.250
What the hell?

02:00.294 --> 02:01.904
Oh, that's no chauffeur.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.471
That's The Iron Sheik.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.256
This is you, bubba.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.997
- This could get ugly.
- Woo!

02:08.040 --> 02:11.305
- I take your bag.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.133
My luggage!

02:13.176 --> 02:14.482
- All tighty-whities?

02:14.525 --> 02:16.788
- Just undies?
Is that all you brought?

02:18.181 --> 02:20.183
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.098
This is
an international airport.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.057
This is no place for a brawl.

02:25.101 --> 02:28.626
The only place for a brawl
is the Backyard Brawl-B-Q,

02:28.670 --> 02:31.673
and things may not settle down
until then.

02:31.716 --> 02:32.978
Security!

02:33.022 --> 02:34.980
My mom was finding her rhythm

02:35.024 --> 02:36.373
as a wrestling promoter,

02:36.417 --> 02:38.288
and she was creating
all these amazing story lines

02:38.332 --> 02:40.943
for her events,
but she was so busy

02:40.986 --> 02:43.206
running the family business--
Randall, what is this?

02:43.250 --> 02:45.513
- What are we doin'?
- Oh, this is a blanket.

02:45.556 --> 02:48.168
I brought it from home.
I'm just a hair chilly.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.779
- Mm.
Okay.

02:50.822 --> 02:53.390
Well, she was so busy
running the business

02:53.434 --> 02:56.176
that she didn't realize
that...

02:56.219 --> 02:57.786
I was going through
some changes,

02:57.829 --> 02:59.788
<i>let's say</i>
<i>pushing some boundaries.</i>

03:03.705 --> 03:07.187
- He wrote on my pants--
permanent marker!

03:12.192 --> 03:14.063
A pigeon
in the teachers' lounge!

03:17.545 --> 03:19.242
Perfectly good cheese!

03:19.286 --> 03:22.332
- Ten! Mark it.

03:22.376 --> 03:25.074
- Everybody
take your new pages.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.336
I wrote your names on the top

03:26.380 --> 03:28.686
so you know
which ones are yours.

03:28.730 --> 03:31.428
- Ah, sweet.
Mine say "Macho."

03:31.472 --> 03:32.690
That's right.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.519
- Say, Rock,
can I share with you?

03:35.563 --> 03:36.955
I seem to have lost mine.

03:36.999 --> 03:38.566
You guys are doing so great

03:38.609 --> 03:40.132
with all the new story lines.

03:40.176 --> 03:42.352
We aired the airport stunt
during the match on Saturday.

03:42.396 --> 03:43.875
The fans ate it up!

03:43.919 --> 03:45.355
- Woo!

03:45.399 --> 03:46.530
Now, just remember to take

03:46.574 --> 03:48.053
your pages home with you,
please.

03:48.097 --> 03:50.186
Last week, I found a bunch
of them in the men's room.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.144
That was me.

03:52.188 --> 03:53.537
Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.

03:53.581 --> 03:55.496
But some people called for you.

03:55.539 --> 03:57.585
<i>- Wait,</i>
<i>is that Downtown Bruno?</i>

03:57.628 --> 03:59.108
<i>Yup, that's Bruno.</i>

03:59.151 --> 04:00.544
<i>He looks so young.</i>

04:00.588 --> 04:01.719
<i>- That was before</i>
<i>he discovered</i>

04:01.763 --> 04:03.243
<i>chicken wings and whiskey.</i>

04:03.286 --> 04:04.809
<i>- Really?</i>
<i>- Nah.</i>

04:04.853 --> 04:06.681
<i>He was deep into both by then.</i>

04:08.030 --> 04:09.684
- Yeah, okay, so the first--
vet called.

04:09.727 --> 04:10.815
Francine's eye medicine
is ready,

04:10.859 --> 04:12.382
so I'll make sure
to go get that.

04:12.426 --> 04:14.558
And then--oh, yeah, yeah,
Dewey's principal called.

04:14.602 --> 04:17.082
Dewey's principal?

04:17.126 --> 04:18.954
"Shenanigans," Mom.

04:18.997 --> 04:21.086
That's the word he used
to describe Dewey's behavior,

04:21.130 --> 04:22.479
"shenanigans."

04:22.523 --> 04:25.265
- Why are you doing shenanigans
at school, Dewey?

04:25.308 --> 04:26.570
I'm not!

04:26.614 --> 04:28.703
- Shh! No talking.
You're being punished.

04:28.746 --> 04:32.576
- Fine!
Francine's farting.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.926
- Classic shenanigans.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.538
- Rocky, this is serious.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.191
Something's going on
with Dewey.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.455
- So the boy turns heel
for a couple of weeks.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.065
It happens.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.285
We're lucky he's only tossin'
cheese slices.

04:45.328 --> 04:46.416
When I was his age,

04:46.460 --> 04:48.200
I was boostin' car stereos.

04:50.638 --> 04:53.815
- Ata, don't worry.
Dewey's a good boy.

04:53.858 --> 04:56.296
- I know he is.
That's why I'm so confused.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.601
Maybe because
his dad's the champ,

04:57.645 --> 04:59.168
now he's getting a big head.

04:59.211 --> 05:00.604
A few weeks ago,
he got in trouble

05:00.648 --> 05:02.432
for stealing
a janitor's ladder.

05:02.476 --> 05:05.130
- And he killed the janitor?
- No.

05:05.174 --> 05:07.307
But it's still not good.

05:07.350 --> 05:08.525
He's getting bigger--

05:08.569 --> 05:09.874
bigger than the other kids
in his class.

05:09.918 --> 05:12.312
Andre know what that is like.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.704
When I was Dewey's age,

05:13.748 --> 05:16.403
I threw my teacher
into the forest.

05:16.446 --> 05:18.361
- You want me to talk to him?
- Would you?

05:18.405 --> 05:19.667
That would be great.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.146
I'm sure Rocky's right

05:21.190 --> 05:22.626
and I'm probably making
a big deal out of nothing,

05:22.670 --> 05:25.673
but I just don't want him
to become, you know,

05:25.716 --> 05:27.631
a bully.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.503
Except for white chocolate,

05:29.546 --> 05:32.462
being a bully is
the worst thing on this Earth.

05:32.506 --> 05:33.637
Thank you.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.160
- Yeah, look,
all I'm saying is,

05:35.204 --> 05:36.901
I do 99% of the work.

05:36.945 --> 05:40.427
But since Tony gets the pin,
he gets most of the credit.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.342
- Hey, I've been working
with this promoter.

05:42.385 --> 05:43.908
He's planning a match
in Saudi Arabia,

05:43.952 --> 05:45.475
wants to open up
that whole territory.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.042
- Mm!
- He was sayin'

05:47.085 --> 05:49.000
there's a Rocky-sized hole
in the market.

05:49.044 --> 05:51.176
Really?

05:52.656 --> 05:56.268
- Thank you all for coming
to my trial eve dinner.

05:56.312 --> 05:59.402
To my jury, who I am confident

05:59.446 --> 06:01.665
are gonna find me
a lady innocent.

06:01.709 --> 06:04.015
Hear, hear.

06:04.059 --> 06:07.367
- Oh, that reminds me.
I gotta ring Bob.

06:09.107 --> 06:10.674
Bob, please.

06:10.718 --> 06:13.590
<i>Hello, FBI,</i>
<i>connect me to Bob.</i>

06:14.809 --> 06:17.246
- Mrs. Maivia,
again, I'm not an operator.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.943
I'm tapping your phones.

06:18.987 --> 06:20.336
Bob, please.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.604
<i>Pronto?</i>

06:27.648 --> 06:29.519
Bob, it's me.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.652
Just checking on the brisket.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.958
- Is it ready yet?
<i>- Ah, yes.</i>

06:34.002 --> 06:37.701
The brisket.
The brisket is cooking.

06:37.745 --> 06:41.183
<i>[Eurythmics' "Sweet Dreams</i>

07:04.902 --> 07:05.990
Wait!

07:07.644 --> 07:09.603
I'm trying to give you mangos!

07:28.360 --> 07:29.797
Before we begin,

07:29.840 --> 07:31.625
it has come
to the court's attention

07:31.668 --> 07:34.279
that the defendant, Lia Maivia,

07:34.323 --> 07:37.108
has attempted to illegally
influence the jury

07:37.152 --> 07:39.981
and the judge
for some reason...

07:40.024 --> 07:41.286
with fruit.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.071
The bailiff will now collect
all the mangos.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.643
- What if
we already ate our mango?

07:51.819 --> 07:53.516
- My grandmother
loved mangos too!

07:53.560 --> 07:56.563
- Yes, they draw their power
from the elderly.

07:56.606 --> 07:57.955
What?

07:57.999 --> 08:00.523
- The fruit do?
- Yeah.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.307
Mm.

08:02.351 --> 08:04.135
Mm-hmm.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.398
- I don't know how things work
in the wrestling business,

08:06.442 --> 08:07.922
Mrs. Maivia,

08:07.965 --> 08:11.055
but in my courtroom,
we follow the rules,

08:11.099 --> 08:13.318
which is why I've chosen
to sequester the jury

08:13.362 --> 08:16.104
at the DoubleTree hotel until
the conclusion of this trial.

08:16.147 --> 08:17.235
Not the DoubleTree!

08:17.279 --> 08:19.150
- But I have tickets
to see Aerosmith!

08:23.154 --> 08:23.372
.

08:23.415 --> 08:25.983
- So while my grandmother
was dealing with a setback

08:26.027 --> 08:26.984
in her trial,
my mom was trying to figure out

08:27.028 --> 08:28.377
why I kept acting out
in school,

08:28.420 --> 08:31.598
so she called in
the best man for the job.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.730
- Where is my other
coral earring?

08:33.774 --> 08:35.036
I'm gonna be late!

08:35.079 --> 08:37.908
- I don't understand why
"Mary Worth" is in here.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.651
Go on, answer it.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.352
<i>Bonjour, mon ami.</i>

08:47.396 --> 08:49.093
- Andre?

08:49.137 --> 08:52.662
- Hi, Andre.
- Hi, Ata.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.316
What are you doing here?

08:54.359 --> 08:57.362
- Well, today
you spend the day with Andre,

08:57.406 --> 08:59.582
- again.
- But I have school.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.758
- It's okay to miss one day.
Go on, go get ready.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.107
Yes!

09:03.151 --> 09:05.066
Oh, hey, Speed Racer!

09:05.109 --> 09:07.111
- Hey, Andre.
- Rocky.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.504
Ooh, babe.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.462
Hey, sorry I can't make it
to Lia's trial today.

09:10.506 --> 09:12.029
I'm waitin' on Vince McMahon
to call me back.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.074
That's fine.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.466
Her white lawyer, Herman,

09:14.510 --> 09:15.729
says it's best
to not have any wrestlers there

09:15.772 --> 09:17.905
in case the jury has a bias.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.080
<i>All rise.</i>

09:21.082 --> 09:23.475
United States
versus Lia Maivia,

09:23.519 --> 09:25.782
the Honorable
Judge Lamington presiding.

09:28.524 --> 09:30.482
- All right,
let's get started.

09:30.526 --> 09:31.962
Prosecution,
your first witness?

09:32.006 --> 09:33.311
Thank you, Your Honor.

09:33.355 --> 09:35.618
The prosecution calls
Lonnie McGill.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.228
Nice lady,

09:37.272 --> 09:39.622
but she did threaten to bash
my head in like a watermelon.

09:41.363 --> 09:44.671
- Sylvester Ritter,
AKA Junkyard Dog.

09:44.714 --> 09:47.325
- Love Lia.
Wrestled for her for years.

09:47.369 --> 09:48.631
She was always good to me.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.067
- Didn't she threaten
to slap you?

09:51.895 --> 09:53.244
- No.
- May I remind you

09:53.288 --> 09:54.724
that you're under oath?

09:54.768 --> 09:56.639
- She was always
threatenin' slaps.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.641
Somebody do somethin'
that she didn't like,

09:58.685 --> 10:00.774
she was breakin' out
them gloves.

10:00.817 --> 10:03.341
Slap City.
Slap City limits.

10:03.385 --> 10:05.039
She was like
Gladys Knight and The Slaps.

10:06.562 --> 10:09.957
- Christopher Alan Pallies,
AKA King Kong Bundy.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.524
- One time, she said my ring
outfits make me look like

10:12.568 --> 10:14.831
a bald woman trying on
swimsuits at the mall!

10:25.450 --> 10:27.191
We need to change your image.

10:33.894 --> 10:35.417
Mrs. Maivia.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.594
Mrs. Maivia!

10:38.638 --> 10:39.682
Yes?

10:39.726 --> 10:41.684
- What are you doing?
- Knitting,

10:41.728 --> 10:43.643
like a grandmother does.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.035
- It looks like
you're just

10:45.079 --> 10:47.081
hitting two knitting needles
together.

10:47.124 --> 10:49.300
- Oh, no.
I'm making a gift.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.476
It's a summer hand muff
for your wife

10:51.520 --> 10:53.478
for nighttime beach walks.

10:55.698 --> 10:58.048
It's just the base.

10:58.875 --> 11:03.097
- Then you lead the pony to
the pumpkin patch, and voilà.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.403
Your hook has been snelled.

11:05.447 --> 11:06.927
- Got it.
- Good.

11:06.970 --> 11:08.102
Now we fish.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.669
Remember how I show you?

11:13.455 --> 11:14.848
<i>C'est magnifique,</i> Dewey.

11:16.197 --> 11:19.026
So Andre tell Dewey a story,
huh?

11:19.069 --> 11:23.857
Once upon a time, there was
a woman who had a cherry bush.

11:23.900 --> 11:27.469
And one day, she see a toad
eating her cherries.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.080
And she say to the toad,
"Hey, toad!

11:30.124 --> 11:31.734
Get away from my cherries!"

11:32.866 --> 11:35.695
But the toad
was secretly a witch.

11:37.348 --> 11:41.004
She put a spell on the woman
so her baby would be born

11:41.048 --> 11:43.920
covered in hair like a dog.

11:45.617 --> 11:48.751
- I'm gonna shoot you
straight here, Andre.

11:48.795 --> 11:51.101
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.886
- Just because
you're becoming big

11:52.929 --> 11:55.410
does not mean you can bully
the children at school, huh?

11:55.453 --> 11:58.369
- Hey, the bigger you are--
- Oh.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.110
This is about me
getting in trouble?

12:00.154 --> 12:01.764
<i>- Oui.</i>
- I'm not doing that stuff

12:01.808 --> 12:03.113
because I'm big.

12:03.157 --> 12:05.376
I'm doing it because of a girl.

12:06.290 --> 12:07.465
A girl?

12:28.748 --> 12:31.968
- It felt weird to tell my mom
because she's like an old girl,

12:32.012 --> 12:35.798
and my dad would just be like,
"Is she a wrestling fan?

12:35.842 --> 12:37.452
Sell her my merch."

12:37.495 --> 12:39.802
- I think I'm in love.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.196
- And I've never felt
these feelings before.

12:42.979 --> 12:45.939
- Maybe we don't talk
for a while, huh?

12:45.982 --> 12:47.288
The fish are sleeping.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.687
- Hello?

12:55.731 --> 12:57.037
Rocky, it's Vince Mc--

12:57.080 --> 12:58.778
One sec.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.476
Rocky, it's Vince McMahon.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.521
<i>Sorry, I was eating a burrito.</i>

13:03.565 --> 13:04.827
<i>Anyway, how are you, Rock?</i>

13:04.871 --> 13:07.003
- You left a message?
<i>- First of all,</i>

13:07.047 --> 13:08.526
I just wanna say
I'm very excited

13:08.570 --> 13:10.485
about getting back
on the road for the WWF.

13:10.528 --> 13:12.139
<i>And I was thinking,</i>

13:12.182 --> 13:13.618
look, I know,
for the most part,

13:13.662 --> 13:15.707
it's gonna be Tony and I
defending the tag team titles.

13:15.751 --> 13:19.711
But...what if we threw
a couple solo matches my way?

13:19.755 --> 13:21.409
I feel like
there's a Rocky-sized hole

13:21.452 --> 13:22.584
in the market right now.

13:22.627 --> 13:23.846
Oh, I agree, Rocky.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.109
You're a wonderful
singles competitor.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.851
- Oh.
Thank you. That's great.

13:28.895 --> 13:32.768
- But you and Tony together,
it's historic.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.858
<i>I mean, it's legendary.</i>
<i>It's--it's inspiring.</i>

13:35.902 --> 13:37.991
- Uh-huh, yeah.
<i>- We can't break that apart.</i>

13:38.034 --> 13:40.645
Think about all the kids
out there who love you, Rock,

13:40.689 --> 13:42.778
that--that believe in you.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.780
We can't do that to them,
right?

13:44.824 --> 13:47.522
- Uh...right.
Yeah, no, no, no,

13:47.565 --> 13:49.611
- we can't do that.
- Good!

13:49.654 --> 13:51.743
Glad we had this talk.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.876
<i>So look, I've got</i>
<i>something big brewing.</i>

13:53.920 --> 13:55.747
I'm bettin' the farm
on this one.

13:55.791 --> 13:56.879
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what I'm gonna name it--</i>

13:56.923 --> 14:01.275
<i>maybe Wrestlefest</i>
<i>or Wrestleplex.</i>

14:01.318 --> 14:02.580
<i>It's gonna be huge.</i>

14:04.495 --> 14:04.844
.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.889
<i>I don't have the money.</i>

14:06.933 --> 14:07.847
<i>- Then you have to pay</i>
<i>a different price.</i>

14:07.890 --> 14:08.891
<i>What do you mean?</i>

14:08.935 --> 14:10.632
<i>Bang, bang.</i>

14:10.675 --> 14:13.113
- Mrs. Maivia,
is that you on the tape?

14:13.156 --> 14:14.636
Yes,

14:14.679 --> 14:16.507
but I wasn't threatening
Greg Yao.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.987
That's just how I talk.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.076
Bang, bang. Boom, boom.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.904
It's a wrestling thing.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.340
Bang, bang.

14:23.384 --> 14:25.690
- That's how you talk?
- That's right.

14:25.734 --> 14:26.909
Boom, boom.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.911
- I've never heard you add
those words

14:28.955 --> 14:31.087
to the end of your sentences
until just now.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.872
- I have been.
Bang, boom.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.395
- Can we get
the court stenographer

14:34.438 --> 14:37.093
to read back any part of
the transcript that shows that?

14:37.137 --> 14:39.008
- She missed it.
Boom, bang.

14:39.052 --> 14:40.705
You should fire her.

14:40.749 --> 14:41.881
Boom, boom.

14:43.491 --> 14:46.233
- I didn't know you wanted
to talk about love.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.278
I thought you were bullying
because you're becoming big,

14:48.322 --> 14:50.672
- so I take you fishing.
- Andre, it's fine.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.892
We don't have to talk
about love if you don't want.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.241
We can just fish.

14:54.284 --> 14:56.765
- This is not
Andre's area of expertise, huh?

14:56.808 --> 14:59.811
Andre is a giant, not a Romeo.

15:01.248 --> 15:03.511
But if you want to talk
about love,

15:03.554 --> 15:04.468
then we talk about love.

15:04.512 --> 15:05.556
Okay, great.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.167
So her name is Debbie Rose,

15:07.210 --> 15:09.691
and she wears these little
colored balls in her hair,

15:09.734 --> 15:11.954
and she's a fan
of REO Speedwagon.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.217
She smells
like Johnson's Baby Shampoo.

15:14.261 --> 15:16.045
Oh, one time,
I made a joke about that

15:16.089 --> 15:18.004
because my last name
is Johnson.

15:18.047 --> 15:19.744
But she didn't laugh.

15:19.788 --> 15:22.182
Anyways, whenever I see her,

15:22.225 --> 15:25.402
my stomach feels like
I just ate a bag of Pop Rocks.

15:25.446 --> 15:27.622
Is that a question?

15:27.665 --> 15:29.450
I guess my question is,

15:29.493 --> 15:31.060
how do you get a girl
to like you?

15:31.104 --> 15:33.193
Women.

15:33.236 --> 15:35.935
They're complex creatures,
Dewey.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.981
They are strong of will
and firm of heart.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.244
And they only go
where they wish to.

15:41.288 --> 15:44.204
If she like you,
then she like you.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.989
- And if she doesn't?
<i>- Que será, será.</i>

15:47.033 --> 15:49.992
- What does that mean?
- It means <i>c'est la vie.</i>

15:50.036 --> 15:52.255
- I don't understand
any of that.

15:52.299 --> 15:55.519
Andre,
have you ever been in love?

15:55.563 --> 15:56.912
<i>Oui, mon ami.</i>

15:56.956 --> 15:58.348
Andre has loved.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.786
Her name was Brigitte.

16:01.830 --> 16:04.180
She was Andre's stewardess
when he fly to Japan.

16:06.226 --> 16:08.924
She had blonde hair and a...

16:08.968 --> 16:11.057
beautiful, kind face.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.886
And when Andre ask
for a glass of wine...

16:16.410 --> 16:18.325
Brigitte bring him
the whole bottle.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.632
- Did you tell her
how you felt?

16:21.676 --> 16:23.460
At the end of flight,

16:23.504 --> 16:25.680
when Brigitte bring
a hot towel,

16:25.723 --> 16:27.421
Andre tell her how he feel,

16:27.464 --> 16:29.423
and he ask her
to join him for dinner.

16:29.466 --> 16:30.554
Then what happened?

16:32.948 --> 16:34.819
Brigitte belonged to the sky.

16:34.863 --> 16:37.083
She's dead?

16:37.126 --> 16:40.956
- No.
No, she is working.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.436
She's too busy
to have dinner with Andre.

16:43.785 --> 16:46.614
- So sad.
- No.

16:46.657 --> 16:49.269
No, Andre got to be in love.

16:50.183 --> 16:53.577
Love does not have to be
returned to be love, Dewey.

16:53.621 --> 16:54.883
It's a feeling.

16:54.926 --> 16:58.321
And if you feel it,
then it's real.

16:58.365 --> 17:02.412
It fills you up with...

17:02.456 --> 17:03.761
The Pop Rocks.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.155
- Oh, oh!
- Oh!

17:06.199 --> 17:08.897
- Oh, my God! It--
- Reel her in, <i>mon ami!</i>

17:08.940 --> 17:12.292
- Whoo!

17:12.335 --> 17:15.599
- Yeah!

17:15.643 --> 17:19.951
- Oh!
<i>Très bien, Dewey!</i>

17:22.737 --> 17:24.434
Okay.

17:24.478 --> 17:25.566
Now we release her, huh?

17:25.609 --> 17:27.611
- Release her?
But I just caught her.

17:27.655 --> 17:31.354
- You want her to stay.
She does not want to.

17:31.398 --> 17:35.924
So like Brigitte, we honor
and respect her choice,

17:35.967 --> 17:38.057
even though we do not share it.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.101
We let her go, huh?

17:43.845 --> 17:45.716
<i>Bonne chance, ma choupette.</i>

17:45.760 --> 17:47.544
Bye, fish.

17:53.768 --> 17:57.424
So if you only keep the fish
that want to be kept,

17:57.467 --> 18:00.209
how many fish do you
actually end up getting to eat?

18:00.253 --> 18:03.082
- Oh,
Andre do not eat the fish.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.171
The wine pairings
do not speak to me.

18:09.523 --> 18:09.958
.

18:10.001 --> 18:12.047
- So Andre the Giant
taught you about love?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.396
I learned about it

18:13.440 --> 18:15.529
from watching
two squirrels in the park.

18:15.572 --> 18:17.096
- Mm.
- Yeah.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.880
- They were goin' at it.
- Mm.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.362
- Well, I came
out of that day changed,

18:22.405 --> 18:24.581
and my mom
was so happy about that,

18:24.625 --> 18:27.018
and even if she didn't know it,

18:27.062 --> 18:28.759
she sent in the right person
for the job.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.587
Mm.

18:36.811 --> 18:38.595
- Hi, Debbie Rose.
- Hi, Dewey.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.600
I like you.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.907
Oh, okay.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.952
Like, <i>like</i> like?

18:47.996 --> 18:50.955
- Yeah.
Do you <i>like</i> like me?

18:50.999 --> 18:52.957
No, sorry.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.742
I just like you regular.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.095
I understand.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.445
You're a complex creature
who is strong of will

19:02.489 --> 19:05.927
and firm of heart, and nobody
can tell you what to do.

19:08.364 --> 19:09.322
I release you.

19:10.845 --> 19:13.978
<i>Que será--la-la, la-la.</i>

19:14.022 --> 19:16.329
- What?
- It's French.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.685
What was that about?

19:24.728 --> 19:28.384
- I think Dewey Johnson just...
respected me.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.517
- Huh,
I wonder if it'll catch on.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.606
Fart pony, fart pony!

19:32.649 --> 19:34.303
- Ow!
- Oh!

19:35.696 --> 19:39.178
<i>- Ugh, Julien again?</i>
<i>- Always been the worst.</i>

19:42.137 --> 19:44.052
Mom, what are you doing?

19:44.095 --> 19:46.054
Packing for prison.

19:46.097 --> 19:49.100
- Do you want my wooden spoons?

19:49.144 --> 19:50.580
Don't need these
where I'm going.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.191
Don't be ridiculous.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.062
There's still a lot
of trial to go.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.196
I'm tired of fighting.

19:57.239 --> 19:58.980
I am a lady innocent.

19:59.023 --> 20:02.026
But the court system's
so cruel...

20:02.070 --> 20:05.508
which is why I want you to take
over the business permanently.

20:07.554 --> 20:08.990
- No.
- No?

20:09.033 --> 20:10.383
Who's gonna run things?

20:11.775 --> 20:13.951
You will...

20:13.995 --> 20:15.779
because you're
the strongest woman I know,

20:15.823 --> 20:18.042
and you're going
to get through this.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.696
The jury doesn't believe me.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.917
- The jury isn't any different
from a wrestling audience.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.354
We tell them what's real
and what's not.

20:25.398 --> 20:26.921
It's what we do.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.532
Also, nobody believes
you're tired of fighting.

20:29.576 --> 20:30.968
You love fighting.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.841
- I do, don't I?

20:33.884 --> 20:35.495
We just need a plan.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.417
Casey, hey.

20:44.460 --> 20:47.463
- How's it goin'?
<i>- Not well.</i>

20:47.507 --> 20:51.380
It turns out that the governor
and Monica were more rivals

20:51.424 --> 20:53.600
than friends
on the tae kwon do team.

20:53.643 --> 20:56.124
And they decided pretty quickly
for old times' sake

20:56.167 --> 20:58.344
to throw on their doboks
and have a grapple,

20:58.387 --> 21:01.564
and Monica,
being in far superior shape,

21:01.608 --> 21:04.567
dispatched the governor
with pace and brutality.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.743
<i>There is video, which we've</i>
<i>managed to secure all of,</i>

21:06.787 --> 21:09.485
<i>thank God, because it is not</i>
<i>something that you wanna see.</i>

21:09.529 --> 21:12.314
<i>At one point, the governor</i>
<i>literally begs for mercy,</i>

21:12.358 --> 21:14.577
<i>and Monica reminded her</i>
<i>that tae kwon do means</i>

21:14.621 --> 21:15.970
<i>"the way of the foot</i>
<i>and fist"</i>

21:16.013 --> 21:18.102
<i>and showed her none.</i>

21:18.146 --> 21:19.930
- Sounds like General Jackson
had an old grudge

21:19.974 --> 21:21.541
she couldn't let go of.

21:21.584 --> 21:22.846
You know, like you and--

21:22.890 --> 21:24.544
- Yes,
we all see the parallels.

21:24.587 --> 21:25.545
Thank you, Randall.

21:30.506 --> 21:31.551
<i>I think that's a good idea.</i>
