WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.536
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:02.570 --> 00:05.073
Juliette Barnes went
after concertgoers...

00:05.106 --> 00:06.507
Nobody likes you!

00:06.540 --> 00:08.176
Excuse me.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.177
You know we're trying
to put on a show here.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.211
What is going on?

00:10.244 --> 00:11.479
I struggle with depression.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.347
And I'm putting
my tour on hold.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.648
What do you want from me?

00:14.682 --> 00:16.184
I want to help you
change your life.

00:16.217 --> 00:18.352
How am I supposed to
do this by myself?

00:18.386 --> 00:20.288
So just imagine
I'm up there with you.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.622
How's La

00:21.655 --> 00:23.191
I almost did something
real stupid.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.192
Say, you getting a tattoo?

00:24.225 --> 00:25.726
No, worse.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.828
You take good care
of yourself, Deacon.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.263
You too, Jess.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.534
Oh, thank you very much.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.070
Appreciate it.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.371
Oh, we should get some of...
Nope.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.076
What time is
your show tonight?

00:44.145 --> 00:46.580
It's a small show
and really rough set.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.149
Oh, come on, please.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.284
Hey, as your uncle,
your head of your label,

00:50.318 --> 00:51.785
your biggest fan, yes,
I'm going to your show tonight.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.454
You're sweet.
Thank you.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.190
Ugh.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.826
What are we doing?

00:58.859 --> 01:02.130
Oh, was that Gunnar?
- Yep.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.131
You just gonna stare
at that zucchini?

01:03.164 --> 01:04.632
Stare at this zucchini.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.167
I'd appreciate it if
you did too, there you go.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.836
That rough, huh?

01:08.869 --> 01:10.371
Yeah, well, we tried talking.
That didn't work.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.206
So now we're not talking.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.108
And I don't know what the
etiquette is for public run-ins.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.177
And here we are.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.611
Well, he's gone.
Can we stop doing this?

01:17.645 --> 01:19.079
Yes.

01:21.682 --> 01:22.716
Oh!

01:22.750 --> 01:24.585
- Hey!
- Hi! Hi.

01:24.618 --> 01:25.686
We keep bumping
into people here.

01:25.719 --> 01:26.887
It's been forever.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.722
Yes, totally. Hi.
Nice to see you.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.124
You, too.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.195
I didn't expect it to be
so long since we saw each other.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.596
Yeah. Well, you know,
time flies

01:35.629 --> 01:36.864
when you're
raising kids, right?

01:36.897 --> 01:39.099
It does, right? Yeah.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.736
Well, speaking of kids,
I gotta go pick up mine

01:42.770 --> 01:44.238
from soccer practice, so...

01:44.272 --> 01:46.774
Oh, all right.
Tell 'em good luck.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.709
I, well, it's practice, but...

01:48.742 --> 01:50.211
- Oh, no, well...
- I will.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.613
- Okay. Thank you.
- Good seeing you.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.482
- All right.
- All right.

01:54.515 --> 01:55.483
Bye, Scarlett.
- Take care.

01:55.516 --> 01:58.152
Bye.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.220
You've got to call her.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.288
What are you talking about?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.922
Don't hide your feelings.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.724
This from a woman that's
hiding behind an eggplant!

02:03.757 --> 02:05.593
- Zucchini.
- Whatever.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.794
- That's completely different.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.429
Because Gunnar and
I ran our course

02:08.462 --> 02:10.498
and y'all chickened out
at the starting gate.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.833
- I didn't chicken out.
- You did.

02:12.866 --> 02:13.867
No.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.406
Oh. Hey, buddy, what's up?

02:18.439 --> 02:21.475
Oh, I saw Scarlett at
the market and she avoided me.

02:21.509 --> 02:22.676
Or I guess it's
remotely possible

02:22.710 --> 02:24.478
she never saw me
in the first place.

02:24.512 --> 02:28.649
Anyway, I should probably not
get so worked up about it.

02:28.682 --> 02:29.750
What do you think?

02:29.783 --> 02:31.485
I think you're right.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.454
What, that she saw me
or she didn't?

02:33.487 --> 02:35.423
That you're obsessing.

02:35.456 --> 02:38.926
Look, you two are on
different paths now, okay?

02:38.959 --> 02:41.929
And part of that is
getting used to the idea

02:41.962 --> 02:43.497
that you can't be worried
about what the other person

02:43.531 --> 02:45.299
is thinking and feeling
at all times.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.568
Yeah. You're right.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.938
Hey, you still got
that gig on Thursday?

02:50.971 --> 02:52.673
Yeah. What about it?

02:52.706 --> 02:55.276
I was just wondering
if you wanted me

02:55.309 --> 02:56.610
to play with you again.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.779
Oh. Well, look, man.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.814
I really appreciate you
bailing me out the other night.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.284
I mean, I really do,
but I'm okay.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.286
And I got to learn to do it by
myself at some point, right?

03:05.319 --> 03:06.520
Well, yeah, sure.

03:06.554 --> 03:07.521
For the record,
I wasn't offering

03:07.555 --> 03:08.756
because I was worried about you.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.791
- Yeah, you were.
- No, I wasn't.

03:10.824 --> 03:11.892
Well, then why?

03:11.925 --> 03:13.627
Because it was fun.

03:14.628 --> 03:15.796
Fun?

03:15.829 --> 03:18.532
Yeah, it was fun!
You heard of it?

03:18.566 --> 03:22.303
I haven't felt that free
on stage in a long time.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.972
So what could be more fun than
playing with your best friend?

03:25.005 --> 03:26.407
Avery?

03:26.440 --> 03:27.908
No. I was talking...

03:27.941 --> 03:29.677
No, I'm kidding man, yeah.
It was pretty fun.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.645
It was.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.452
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

03:38.486 --> 03:39.653
Mmm.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.291
What's up?

03:43.324 --> 03:44.758
Nothing.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.796
Why are staring at me
while I eat?

03:48.829 --> 03:50.464
I'm not.

03:50.498 --> 03:53.834
I just, I got a name
for someone today,

03:53.867 --> 03:57.671
someone that I thought
maybe you could... talk to.

03:57.705 --> 04:00.274
Like a shrink?

04:00.308 --> 04:03.811
Yeah, and I know your
opinion of that profession.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.347
So before you get mad at me,
I'm just worried about you.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.049
I'm not mad. I'm not.
I know I need help.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.918
And it just so happens
I have a plan for that.

04:11.985 --> 04:14.054
- Mm-hmm.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.956
I'm gonna go see
Darius Enright tomorrow

04:15.989 --> 04:17.791
and see what his
whole thing's about.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.760
Oh.

04:19.793 --> 04:20.794
What?

04:20.828 --> 04:22.630
Nothing, nothing.

04:22.663 --> 04:25.499
I guess I just thought you were
talking about seeing a doctor.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.568
He is a doctor.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.037
I mean, a medical one.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.572
Thank you.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.907
Darius has written
four bestselling books

04:33.941 --> 04:36.577
that have been translated into
over 60 different languages.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.046
How many books has
your doctor written?

04:39.079 --> 04:40.914
I don't know.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.517
See?

04:43.551 --> 04:46.019
Look, I understand you're
asking me to get help.

04:46.053 --> 04:49.923
And I'm telling you calmly
that's exactly what I'm doing.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.360
Just in my own way.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.894
What more do you want from me?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.445
Twice in one day, huh?

05:12.480 --> 05:14.047
Guilty as charged.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.983
And to what do
I owe this honor?

05:16.016 --> 05:19.887
Well, um, I just, you know,
when I ran into you today,

05:19.920 --> 05:20.954
I just thought...

05:23.090 --> 05:24.758
it's been
a while, you know.

05:24.792 --> 05:25.859
Uh-huh.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.495
And, uh...

05:27.528 --> 05:31.432
even though it's been a
long time, I just...

05:31.465 --> 05:32.766
I don't know.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.470
I thought maybe, you know,
it was a sign.

05:36.504 --> 05:37.538
Or... you know,
maybe I was wrong.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.773
Maybe you and I...

05:39.807 --> 05:41.509
You know, or not. I mean...

05:41.542 --> 05:46.414
No, no.
I'm just surprised, I guess.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.417
Uh, if it's not...

05:49.450 --> 05:54.388
No, no. Um...
That... that, uh, sounds lovely.

05:54.422 --> 05:58.659
It's just, um...
Are you sure?

05:58.692 --> 06:01.829
Yeah, uh, yeah.
Why?

06:01.862 --> 06:04.898
Oh, gosh, this is tough.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.099
I can take it.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.635
I don't know.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.537
It just seems like not
that long ago

06:09.570 --> 06:12.940
when you weren't ready, so...

06:12.973 --> 06:16.043
Well, if I recall,
you weren't exactly ready

06:16.076 --> 06:17.711
to rush into anything either.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.080
Yeah, that's... that's true.

06:20.113 --> 06:24.518
So I guess I thought,
you know, that was then.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.687
This is now, so...

06:30.157 --> 06:32.192
Okay, yeah.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.828
What... Yeah?

06:34.862 --> 06:37.898
Yes. Let's, uh... Yeah.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.468
Okay.

06:50.478 --> 06:53.981
* Looking for the woman
in this girl *

06:57.184 --> 07:01.421
* Ain't no normal
in this world *

07:06.527 --> 07:11.532
* Always hard to find the
path your feet should follow *

07:13.166 --> 07:19.973
* It's enough to leave you
emptied out and hollow *

07:20.007 --> 07:24.945
* And they tell you here's
the truth you need to swallow *

07:24.978 --> 07:28.616
* Then they put you
on a tilt-a-whirl *

07:31.018 --> 07:36.223
* There ain't no normal
in this world *

07:36.256 --> 07:39.927
* Oh, you can pray for
the waves to die *

07:39.960 --> 07:43.497
* Or just decide
to ride the curl *

07:46.567 --> 07:51.539
* There ain't no normal
in this world *

08:27.675 --> 08:29.309
Wow. Gym again?

08:29.342 --> 08:33.581
Oh, you think this work
of art maintains itself?

08:33.614 --> 08:35.148
I don't know, man.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.117
Just seems like every time
I turn around these days,

08:37.150 --> 08:38.852
you're either on your way
there or on your way back.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.253
That's the thing
about exercise.

08:40.287 --> 08:43.023
You're kind of supposed
to do it every day.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.592
Really?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.594
I don't know how you do it.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.996
I gotta take my shirt off
for a photoshoot next week.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.330
That's motivation enough.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.032
Woo! Can I come?

08:52.065 --> 08:54.301
You can shave my back.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.769
I'm good.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.215
So happy to have you back,
Ms. Barnes.

09:08.248 --> 09:14.187
Oh, well, I'm so happy
to be sitting here waiting.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.657
- Hmm.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.258
I don't have that
much more time.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.594
Unfortunately, Darius has
an extremely demanding schedule

09:20.628 --> 09:21.595
that has him on the
road most days.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.163
Yep.

09:23.196 --> 09:26.634
But he asked that I give
you a personalized introduction

09:26.667 --> 09:29.837
to what we do here.
Will that be okay?

09:29.870 --> 09:31.672
Sure.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.273
Intentional communities
like ours now

09:33.306 --> 09:34.975
exist in 29 cities
around the world.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.810
Intentional?

09:36.844 --> 09:39.146
It's just like-minded
people who've decided

09:39.179 --> 09:40.881
that the workshops,

09:40.914 --> 09:43.150
transformative though
they are, weren't enough.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.852
So here, we're able to
support each other year-round

09:44.885 --> 09:46.754
as we strive to be
our best selves.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.989
How exactly do you do that?

09:49.022 --> 09:51.659
Well, most days it's like
living anywhere else.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.794
We go to our jobs
or schools during the day.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.295
But in the evening,
we do things together.

09:55.328 --> 10:00.000
Like meditate, cook, and
we give more of ourselves,

10:00.033 --> 10:02.870
much more than we ever realized
possible, to other people.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.638
How much more?

10:06.273 --> 10:07.941
30% of our income.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.844
And at least one day
per week of good work.

10:10.878 --> 10:13.346
So today, a group of us are
going to be lending our hand

10:13.380 --> 10:15.749
to an affordable housing project
just outside the city.

10:15.783 --> 10:18.018
Would you like to join us?

10:18.051 --> 10:21.922
I... I thought I was gonna
come here to talk to Darius.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.891
I am not dressed for it

10:23.924 --> 10:27.627
and I've got an appointment
in the city.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.200
These are all really
lame excuses, aren't they?

10:42.710 --> 10:44.044
Maddie-boo.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.146
So hungry.
There better still be leftovers.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.248
- There are.
- Thank God.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.817
What's up with you?

10:49.850 --> 10:52.452
I'm just trying to find
a place to eat.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.155
You know, good food,
nothing fancy.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.925
A place where you can talk
without a whole lot of noise.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.393
Like a date spot?

11:00.427 --> 11:03.797
No, not a date spot.
Just... dinner spot.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.999
Who's the lucky lady?

11:06.033 --> 11:08.135
Tell you what.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.302
If it turns out to be
halfway anything,

11:09.336 --> 11:10.904
I'll let you
know then, okay?

11:10.938 --> 11:12.940
Well, if you throw
in $40 bucks,

11:12.973 --> 11:15.709
I will forget to tell
Daphne maybe.

11:15.743 --> 11:16.810
You're terrible.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.985
Well, that looks like
that must be

11:25.018 --> 11:27.320
from that
Jonah what's-his-name.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.189
What?
I can't read you back?

11:29.222 --> 11:31.091
It's just so confusing.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.459
What's confusing?

11:32.492 --> 11:34.461
Yesterday we had this
awesome time together,

11:34.494 --> 11:36.329
like really awesome.
- Mm-hmm.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.932
And now he's taking like
hours to respond to my text.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.934
Can I see it?

11:40.968 --> 11:43.370
You're not maybe making too
much of it if it's just hours?

11:43.403 --> 11:45.205
No. Look.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.907
I texted him at 11 last night.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.942
He doesn't even reply
till noon today.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.944
He doesn't even ask questions.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.946
He's not even trying to
like engage in a conversation.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.514
These are all signals
that you look for

11:54.547 --> 11:55.783
when you're texting someone.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.886
- Yes.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.955
Hi, family!

12:01.989 --> 12:03.757
- Hey.
- Hello.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.428
Hey, you know a good
restaurant somewhere in town?

12:08.461 --> 12:10.263
Like downtown maybe?
Germantown or something?

12:10.297 --> 12:12.833
You took my advice.
I'm so proud of you.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.101
I'm not taking advice,
all right?

12:14.134 --> 12:15.368
Please, I'm just trying
to find a place

12:15.402 --> 12:16.369
to eat some dinner,
that's all.

12:17.504 --> 12:18.471
Okay, grouchy.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.207
I'm not...

12:20.240 --> 12:21.975
- I'll talk to you in a bit.
- I love you, baby.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.343
I love you.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.112
Hey, what was going on
with you last night?

12:25.145 --> 12:27.014
Seemed like something
was off after the show.

12:27.047 --> 12:30.083
Oh, I don't know, I just...

12:32.585 --> 12:35.155
I felt his absence.

12:35.188 --> 12:38.025
Look, I'm sure it must be
weird up there by yourself.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.392
But, believe me,
it'll get better with time.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.161
Yeah.

12:41.194 --> 12:44.497
It's not that
I'm not okay without Gunnar.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.333
Because I actually am.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.435
It's just without him up there,

12:48.468 --> 12:53.306
I'm kind of starting to wonder
why I'm doing it, you know?

12:53.340 --> 12:55.308
No, actually,
I don't follow.

12:55.342 --> 12:58.578
The performance, the lights,
crowds, tension, all that.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.213
It was his dream.
It was never mine.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.015
And now it's just me up there.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.918
I kind of don't really
know if it's what I want.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.187
Listen to me.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.190
All that stuff, Gunnar might
have coaxed it outta you.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.825
But that is you.
That is your talent.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.493
That is all you, okay?

13:13.526 --> 13:15.228
Thank you.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.263
I don't know.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.597
Yeah, well, I do know.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.299
Your songs,
they say something.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.434
And that'd just...

13:21.468 --> 13:23.036
I'm sorry.
I think it'd be a shame if,

13:23.070 --> 13:25.472
you know, they didn't
have an audience.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.040
Thanks.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.042
Speaking of which,
somebody just asked me

13:29.076 --> 13:31.511
if you would like to take
part in a guitar pull.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.213
Maybe it'd be a good way
for you to sort of,

13:33.246 --> 13:34.414
you know, remember
the fun of it.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.549
I'll think about it?

13:36.583 --> 13:39.219
You think about it.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.054
I'll think about it
while you're on your date.

13:42.622 --> 13:45.392
So what kind of experience
do you have on a worksite?

13:47.928 --> 13:49.930
None.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.499
All right, then we will start
you out with something simple.

13:52.532 --> 13:53.901
All right.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.937
All these walls have
to be insulated

13:56.970 --> 13:58.872
before we can seal them up.
All right?

14:02.675 --> 14:03.877
That's where you come in.

14:04.945 --> 14:05.979
Yeah, that's right.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.614
Oh, no.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.950
This, I'm pretty sure,
is a hazard.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.019
You leave this in my hands,
somebody's gonna get hurt.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.486
It's perfectly safe,
all right?

14:13.520 --> 14:15.255
Just watch out you
don't touch the fiberglass

14:15.288 --> 14:18.225
with your bare skin,
all right?

14:18.258 --> 14:20.127
Leaves a nasty rash.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.332
You know I can't
really do this, right?

14:25.365 --> 14:26.934
Why not?

14:26.967 --> 14:29.136
Well, I got into an
accident a year ago.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.403
I shouldn't...

14:30.437 --> 14:32.172
And you made
a remarkable recovery.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.673
You're pretty strong
when you put your mind to it.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.342
Thank you. I am.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.145
But this thing's
the size of my head

14:38.178 --> 14:41.114
and this really
isn't my kind of task.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.085
You know, I actually
think this is

14:45.118 --> 14:46.386
the exact kind of task
you need.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.121
I'll come check in
on you later.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.256
Here you go.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.345
* I've watched you
watch me dance *

15:12.379 --> 15:15.582
* And tip-toe all around it

15:15.615 --> 15:18.051
* Love makes one cautious

15:18.085 --> 15:22.322
* When you think you
finally found it *

15:22.355 --> 15:24.657
* Wore out both my sleeves

15:24.691 --> 15:28.028
* Till my heart
showed completely *

15:28.061 --> 15:31.965
* You've got me right
where you want me *

15:34.201 --> 15:36.269
* There's no use even

15:36.303 --> 15:40.240
* Finishing this conversation

15:40.273 --> 15:42.342
* Kiss me till
I can't breathe *

15:42.375 --> 15:46.179
* There's no negotiation

15:46.213 --> 15:48.615
* This deal is done, you won

15:48.648 --> 15:52.352
* You got your
hands full, honey *

15:52.385 --> 15:56.089
* You've got me right
where you want me *

15:58.325 --> 16:02.395
* You've got me right
where you want me *

16:04.397 --> 16:06.433
I love you!

16:06.466 --> 16:08.401
Thank you!

16:08.435 --> 16:09.602
- I love you!
- Thank you.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.204
- I love you!
I love you.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.605
Oh, hey.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.607
Which one of us you
think she's talking to?

16:14.641 --> 16:17.144
I'm pretty sure
she's talking to you, man.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.046
Hey, which one of
us you talking to?

16:19.079 --> 16:20.080
You!

16:21.348 --> 16:22.782
Honey, you are beautiful.

16:22.815 --> 16:26.519
But you know you're
not my type, right?

16:26.553 --> 16:27.620
Now this guy, however...

16:27.654 --> 16:29.256
- No, no, no.
- Yes.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.557
One of the saddest human
beings I've ever known.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.525
He is so lonely and available!

16:32.559 --> 16:34.661
Please take him!
- I'll take him!

16:36.129 --> 16:37.197
- All right.
Thank you, thank you.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.099
Sold to the highest bidder!

16:40.233 --> 16:41.734
To you guys, cheers.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.270
Cheers, man.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.072
Honestly, though,
what did you think?

16:45.105 --> 16:46.773
Honestly, I think
you guys were having

16:46.806 --> 16:48.441
a little too much fun.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.310
- Yeah.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.611
It means I'm jealous.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.080
You guys are having
a blast up there.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.647
Well, so join us
next time, man.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.782
Come play with us.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.418
Aw, I wish, but I can't.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.287
Why not?

17:00.320 --> 17:02.089
Well, first of all, haven't we
already been down that road?

17:02.122 --> 17:04.424
And, besides, man, I got
my own band to worry about now.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.626
Well, no one's telling you
to give up your own thing.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.361
It could be like a...
like a side project.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.430
Raconteurs.
Or the Highwaymen.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.299
Yeah.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.201
Look, I would, but Juliette's
in a weird place right now.

17:14.234 --> 17:16.136
So I'm double duty
with Cadence.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.637
And it's just...
it's not a good time.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.239
Well, seems like
all that stress

17:19.272 --> 17:21.108
is exactly why you need
to come play with us.

17:21.141 --> 17:24.711
Well, maybe when you have
a kid and an ex-wife... wife...

17:24.744 --> 17:27.347
- Yeah, whatever.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.216
Maybe then you'll understand.

17:29.249 --> 17:32.285
- All right.
End of discussion.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.620
For now.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.426
Ow! Oh!

17:39.459 --> 17:40.693
Everything okay?

17:40.727 --> 17:43.230
Does it look like it?

17:43.263 --> 17:44.431
There's ice in the cooler.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.799
Oh!
Can you get me some?

17:46.833 --> 17:49.169
It's in the van.

17:49.202 --> 17:52.172
Excuse me?

17:52.205 --> 17:53.240
Juliette, nobody's
making you stay here.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.607
But so long as you're here,

17:54.641 --> 17:56.509
you'll be treated
like everybody else.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.245
I got news for you.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.513
I'm not like everyone else.

18:00.547 --> 18:03.216
I'm leaving.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.885
When people hand us things,
we grow weak.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.455
When they refuse us,
we rise to the challenge.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.223
Darius says that a lot.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.125
These things we do,
this good work,

18:12.159 --> 18:13.660
is not really just
about giving back.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.129
It's also about moving
away from victimhood

18:16.163 --> 18:17.697
and realizing your own power.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.601
Stay or go.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.737
It's your choice.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.311
Hey, did you understand
anything in algebra?

18:31.344 --> 18:32.879
Not a single word.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.615
Okay, I'm definitely calling
you about it later then.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.351
There's Jake.

18:38.385 --> 18:42.322
He is so weird.
What is he even doing?

18:43.756 --> 18:45.292
I don't know.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.130
Whatever.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.867
- You came!
- Hey!

18:54.901 --> 18:55.868
I said I would, didn't I?

18:55.902 --> 18:57.737
I know.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.606
It's just, um... it's
really hard for me to understand

18:59.639 --> 19:01.541
how you're like
this famous person.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.443
But you're also
like my friend.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.544
Come on.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.313
- Yep.

19:06.346 --> 19:09.216
Oh, my goodness.
I'm so proud of you. It's great.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.450
Don't be.
It's just a student show.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.219
They pick one of each
of our paintings

19:12.252 --> 19:13.486
so no one's
feelings get hurt.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.721
Come on, baby,
it's a masterpiece.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.290
I love it.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.226
- Hi.
- Mom, this is Scarlett.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.394
Scarlett, this is
my mom, Jennifer.

19:21.428 --> 19:22.829
So nice to meet you.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.432
Well, Nadi here never
shuts up about you.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.234
You meant a lot to me.

19:27.267 --> 19:30.203
I mean, even when
I thought I was alone

19:30.237 --> 19:33.306
I never really was
'cause I had your music.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.875
It helped me through
a really tough time.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.844
I feel a lot better now.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.213
- I'm so glad.
- Thank you.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.685
Thank you.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.295
Hold on just a second, okay?
I'll be right back.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.730
- Okay.
- Hey.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.432
We don't got to eat there.
We can go anywhere you want.

19:59.466 --> 20:00.967
No, no, no.
That's not it.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.535
It's just, um...

20:02.569 --> 20:04.237
You can't make me!

20:04.271 --> 20:07.507
My son is having a bit of
a meltdown right now.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.443
Oh, I'm sorry.
Everything okay?

20:10.477 --> 20:11.744
Yeah, yeah.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.546
It's just, you know,
one of those

20:13.580 --> 20:15.948
"I'm gonna die if
you make me go

20:15.982 --> 20:19.852
to one more day
of eighth grade" kind of deal.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.388
I been there.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.823
Yeah. Well, par for
the course, but...

20:23.856 --> 20:28.861
You just don't think you
should go out to dinner tonight.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.298
Yeah, I just kind
of feel like

20:31.331 --> 20:34.334
with everything going on
maybe... I don't know.

20:34.367 --> 20:37.404
No, I understand, listen.
Hey, kids come first.

20:37.437 --> 20:40.573
Yeah, even when you
want to strangle them.

20:41.874 --> 20:45.312
Anyway, um...
I'm really sorry.

20:45.345 --> 20:49.982
No, no, no, no. No, please,
we'll just do it another time.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.017
Maybe when they turn 18.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.487
Hopefully, a little before
then, but yeah.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.423
Okay. Take care.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.457
All right. Bye.

21:10.403 --> 21:14.407
Nice work, especially
with such a crummy task.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.943
I knew you were hazing me!

21:16.976 --> 21:18.411
Yeah.
I was betting against you.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.879
Bad idea.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.349
Watch out, now.
She can use a staple gun too.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.750
Woo!

21:27.854 --> 21:29.689
We're all getting dinner
back at the center.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.057
You should join us.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.392
I'd love to.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.377
"He was tired of
playing by himself

21:50.410 --> 21:52.879
and he wanted to play with..."

21:52.912 --> 21:53.980
Oh.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.515
Who's that?

21:55.548 --> 21:56.683
Mom.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.685
Yeah, it's Mom.

21:58.718 --> 21:59.986
Hey, baby.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.788
We're just doing
our bedtime stories.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.056
Oh, hi, baby girl.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.459
I miss you.
I love you.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.894
Love you.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.829
We love you, too.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.698
What time you getting home?

22:11.731 --> 22:13.700
Well, you know,
it just got so late here,

22:13.733 --> 22:15.835
I ended up just
sending Bo home.

22:15.868 --> 22:18.605
Juliette, where are
you gonna stay?

22:18.638 --> 22:20.740
Don't worry about it, they've
got a million rooms here.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.709
Okay.

22:22.742 --> 22:25.144
I had a great day, okay?

22:25.177 --> 22:28.881
That is it.
They are good people.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.918
And I felt better
than I have felt in,

22:31.951 --> 22:33.052
I don't even
know how long.

22:33.085 --> 22:35.054
So please don't ruin this.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.057
Okay.

22:39.492 --> 22:40.827
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.806
All right. Got your lunch
and your backpack?

22:53.840 --> 22:55.442
- 10-4, boss.
- Okay.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.047
I gotta take this.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.482
You be ready to go
in five minutes, okay?

23:02.515 --> 23:03.883
I'll be ready.
Will you be ready?

23:03.916 --> 23:05.752
Very funny.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.655
Hey.
- Hey.

23:08.688 --> 23:12.492
So, um... I, uh...

23:12.525 --> 23:16.496
just wanted to call and...

23:16.529 --> 23:18.197
apologize for yesterday.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.699
What do you have
to be sorry for?

23:19.732 --> 23:23.069
Well, there was a lot
of stuff going on.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.037
I didn't make any of that up.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.739
But, um, well,
I kind of feel like

23:26.773 --> 23:28.207
there's always a lot going on.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.711
And the truth is,
I was just...

23:32.779 --> 23:34.046
nervous.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.715
Nervous, huh?

23:35.748 --> 23:38.117
Yeah. I don't know.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.820
It just feels like everything's
super heightened right now

23:40.853 --> 23:44.924
and we're like walking on
some kind of a minefield.

23:48.060 --> 23:53.566
You know, it could just may be
like it's just dinner, you know.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.934
Just two people
sharing a meal?

23:54.967 --> 23:56.536
Hmm, yeah.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.070
I think I've heard
of that before.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.575
Yeah, totally.
It could just be dinner.

24:02.609 --> 24:03.643
It's dinner.

24:03.676 --> 24:06.178
Okay, okay. Well, let's...

24:06.212 --> 24:07.614
Let's do that then.

24:07.647 --> 24:08.848
Okay, all right.

24:08.881 --> 24:09.916
I feel like I should
pretend I got

24:09.949 --> 24:12.184
a whole bunch of
plans this week.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.487
Yeah, me too.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.656
I could potentially look
in my calendar

24:16.689 --> 24:20.860
and see if I maybe have like
an hour next Thursday or...

24:20.893 --> 24:22.194
So tonight?

24:22.228 --> 24:24.997
Yeah, tonight sounds great.

24:25.031 --> 24:26.499
All right, tonight.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.103
What is this stuff?

24:31.137 --> 24:32.839
Salad?

24:32.872 --> 24:35.775
I miss when cafeterias
were allowed to be unhealthy.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.045
I'll be right back.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.051
Hey.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.619
Hey.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.220
You can come sit at
our table if you want.

24:48.254 --> 24:49.989
Do I look like some
Make

24:50.022 --> 24:52.959
Yeah, no, you do.
Just a little funnier-looking.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.063
Wouldn't it have been
super awkward

24:57.096 --> 24:58.565
if our parents had
actually dated?

24:58.598 --> 24:59.632
Yes.

24:59.666 --> 25:02.034
Like those two getting it on?

25:02.068 --> 25:03.670
Ew! That is disgusting!

25:03.703 --> 25:05.204
Yeah, I know.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.944
- Oh, hey.
- Hey. Hey.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.680
Don't you look all nice
and smart and stuff.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.247
Well, that's funny
'cause I feel stupid.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.949
You don't look stupid.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.551
I'm just saying I think
she'll appreciate it.

25:18.585 --> 25:19.552
Please, dear God,
tell me you're not here

25:19.586 --> 25:20.920
to give me a pep talk.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.021
I'm not here to give you
a pep talk.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.723
Good.

25:23.756 --> 25:24.957
You give any more thought
about that guitar pull?

25:24.991 --> 25:26.793
Yeah, lots.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.661
I don't know if my head's
any clearer, but...

25:28.695 --> 25:30.262
What are you thinking?

25:30.296 --> 25:32.899
I'm thinking that music
has given me this platform

25:32.932 --> 25:34.634
that I can use to help people.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.169
So it would be selfish for me
to be worried so much

25:37.203 --> 25:39.839
about whether I enjoy myself
all the time or not.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.775
Look, there's no job that
everybody loves all the time.

25:42.809 --> 25:45.678
But it's not selfish to want
to love what you do.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.814
Thanks.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.782
Look, they said this thing
tonight, it's super informal.

25:49.816 --> 25:51.117
Swing by if you can.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.351
If you don't want to go,
don't go.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.320
Just figure it out as you go.
- Okay.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.356
- Little bit.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.691
Yeah.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.730
Here you go, girl.

26:05.698 --> 26:08.167
Are you expecting
company, hmm?

26:10.402 --> 26:12.238
Hey, guys.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.006
What... what...
What are you doing here?

26:14.040 --> 26:16.008
Avery, listen to me.
This is very important.

26:16.042 --> 26:17.977
What

26:18.010 --> 26:19.612
It's an intervention.

26:19.646 --> 26:21.948
An intervention?
What are you guys talking about?

26:21.981 --> 26:23.249
Who needs help?

26:23.282 --> 26:24.717
Wait, me?

26:24.751 --> 26:26.185
Yep. You're way too mopey.

26:26.218 --> 26:27.887
And we're gonna do
something about it.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.656
- I'm not mopey.
- You're mopey.

26:31.858 --> 26:33.893
What are you doing, man?

26:36.729 --> 26:38.164
Thought you said
you're good at that.

26:38.197 --> 26:39.966
I am good at this.
I just... just give me a second.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.234
All right,
we're gonna be late.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.670
Just... Just get him.

26:43.703 --> 26:46.906
Get him?
I'm not going anywhere.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.208
What...
- Yes, you are, and no excuses!

26:49.241 --> 26:51.377
You're coming with us!
- I'm not going anywhere.

26:51.410 --> 26:52.912
We even got a babysitter
for this little munchkin.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.714
- Thought of everything.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.387
Woo-hoo-hoo!
Look at this line to park!

27:01.420 --> 27:03.389
Okay, this is... this is
the last time I'm gonna ask.

27:03.422 --> 27:04.857
What are we doing here?

27:04.891 --> 27:06.926
It's a surprise.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.194
That's not an answer.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.129
See, Ave, the nature
of a surprise

27:10.162 --> 27:12.298
is that you ruin it
if you tell the person.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.066
- I'm gonna kill you guys.
- Right.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.835
Would you just quit
being an adult?

27:15.868 --> 27:19.105
I am an adult.
You're an adult.

27:19.138 --> 27:22.675
We're all adults
here, supposedly.

27:23.776 --> 27:25.144
Hey.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.746
Oh, hi.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.881
Appreciate you
meeting me up here.

27:28.915 --> 27:30.717
Work got a little crazy.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.352
Oh, no, don't worry about it.
I ended up taking an Uber.

27:33.385 --> 27:36.088
- So...
- Cool.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.690
Shall we?

27:37.724 --> 27:39.025
Oh, sure, okay.

27:40.860 --> 27:41.961
Thank you.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.030
- Hi. We're here.
- Hey.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.397
Great.

27:45.431 --> 27:46.933
So right now, I have
something at the bar.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.267
Or you can wait like
30 minutes for a table.

27:48.300 --> 27:52.371
Uh, you want to wait?
What do you want to do?

27:52.404 --> 27:54.073
I don't know.
What are you thinking?

27:54.106 --> 27:56.108
I'm fine either way.
Are you hungry?

27:56.142 --> 27:59.812
Yeah, I could eat
or I could wait.

27:59.846 --> 28:00.980
I mean...

28:02.514 --> 28:05.417
- Yeah.

28:05.451 --> 28:06.953
Let's sit at the bar.
- Bar.

28:06.986 --> 28:08.320
Great. Right this way.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.222
Okay.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.458
Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen of the Basement East.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.326
Thank you all for
making it out tonight.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.494
You said you
were gonna show up.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.796
You did show up...

28:16.829 --> 28:18.064
- Ms. O'Connor.
- Hi.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.866
We're so happy
you could make it.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.734
We're gonna call the musicians
onstage one by one.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.369
And this is The Amazing Ryan.
You'll be right after him.

28:23.402 --> 28:24.971
Thanks.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.338
We've got Ashley McBride.

28:30.977 --> 28:34.080
A gig

28:34.113 --> 28:35.815
Our gig.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.283
Wait. What?

28:37.316 --> 28:38.284
It's like you guys
didn't even listen

28:38.317 --> 28:39.819
when we talked about this.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.020
No, we heard you, we just
chose to ignore

28:41.053 --> 28:43.022
whatever you had to say.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.924
Avery, this is Beth.

28:44.957 --> 28:46.425
She's a
fantastic babysitter.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.060
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:48.094 --> 28:50.763
Hi, Cadence.

28:50.797 --> 28:53.032
Hey, hey, it's cool.
She got great reviews on Yelp.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.172
So eventually I just said
to myself, "Jessie, you're 36.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.874
Your career's not taking off

29:01.908 --> 29:04.376
and that's not
likely to change.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.346
And it also doesn't really
mesh well with being a parent.

29:07.379 --> 29:11.283
So maybe it's just time
to try something new."

29:13.185 --> 29:14.921
Wow.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.455
Yeah.

29:16.488 --> 29:19.992
So I've been taking some
psychology classes online

29:20.026 --> 29:23.930
and I actually think that I'm
gonna go back to school for it.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.564
And giving up the music?

29:25.597 --> 29:28.367
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.070
No, yeah, I know, I know.
I'm just...

29:31.103 --> 29:33.339
It's... That's exciting.

29:33.372 --> 29:34.907
That's, you know...

29:36.408 --> 29:37.776
Yeah.

29:40.246 --> 29:44.050
So how are you?
Are you writing and playing?

29:44.083 --> 29:47.386
You know, not a lot.
Not as much as I'd like.

29:47.419 --> 29:48.955
It's hard to find
the time sometimes.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.890
Well, you got
to make the time.

29:50.923 --> 29:52.158
- It's too important not to.
- Yeah, you're right. I do.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.426
- Yeah.
- I should.

29:58.931 --> 30:00.299
What?

30:00.332 --> 30:03.302
Is everything okay with you?

30:03.335 --> 30:05.171
Yeah.

30:05.204 --> 30:07.173
- I don't know.

30:09.108 --> 30:10.843
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.078
I just feel like you're
not really here or something.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.582
- I'm here.
- No.

30:16.615 --> 30:19.318
I mean, I'm feeling
a little self-conscious,

30:19.351 --> 30:21.187
now that you say that, but...
- Oh.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.155
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's my fault.

30:23.189 --> 30:24.556
No, it's not your fault.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.458
I'm just saying maybe
you're feeling

30:26.492 --> 30:29.128
a little weird or something.
So you're thinking that I am.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.463
Oh, oh, okay.
So I'm projecting.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.599
Not the word I'd use.

30:33.632 --> 30:36.903
- No. No.

30:36.936 --> 30:39.605
I'm not taking the psychology
class, so maybe that's...

30:39.638 --> 30:41.473
I'm just joking.
It's a joke.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.309
No, I know, I know.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.545
I knew this would happen.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.147
What would happen?

30:48.180 --> 30:50.116
That it would just
ruin our friendship.

30:50.149 --> 30:52.418
This isn't ruining
our friendship, Jessie.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.286
Our friendship is fine, okay?

30:54.320 --> 30:55.988
No, our friendship
is far from fine.

30:56.022 --> 30:57.489
Oh, come on now.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.025
If our friendship was fine,
you would have given me

30:59.058 --> 31:00.626
all kinds of crap
for quitting singing.

31:00.659 --> 31:03.229
And then you would tell me
a story about how your girls

31:03.262 --> 31:05.064
give you a million
distractions from music

31:05.097 --> 31:06.632
but you love them
to pieces anyway.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.034
And we would just be,
you know, talking

31:08.067 --> 31:10.669
instead of just
sitting here trying.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.171
I'm sorry, okay?
I've been...

31:15.474 --> 31:19.211
I've been looking forward
to this a lot, okay?

31:19.245 --> 31:21.147
And I don't know.

31:21.180 --> 31:23.549
Now that I'm here and
you're right there, I don't...

31:25.284 --> 31:26.652
Maybe I'm a
little overwhelmed.

31:26.685 --> 31:29.288
You know?

31:29.321 --> 31:31.490
Well, I'm really
overwhelmed.

31:31.523 --> 31:32.691
- Yeah.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.360
- Well...
- But you were the one

31:34.393 --> 31:37.063
that said that this
could just be dinner, so...

31:37.096 --> 31:38.530
- Yeah.
I mean, I did.

31:38.564 --> 31:41.533
I was... wrong, I guess.

31:41.567 --> 31:44.003
I mean sometimes I guess
dinner isn't just dinner.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.537
I'm sorry.
- Okay.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.373
- Yeah.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.175
Thank you.

31:51.643 --> 31:54.646
So you just want to just
go back to being friends?

31:58.017 --> 32:00.319
- Yeah, okay, sure, yeah.
- Okay.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.991
Okay, quick question.
What are we playing?

32:05.024 --> 32:06.993
That is a good question.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.594
You guys know
"Something More Than Free"?

32:08.627 --> 32:10.029
No.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.597
What about "Whiskey and You"?

32:11.630 --> 32:12.664
- Yeah, I know that one.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.366
Shoot, I don't know that.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.002
Uh...

32:16.035 --> 32:18.270
I got it.

32:18.304 --> 32:19.705
Ladies and gents!

32:19.738 --> 32:22.374
They have informed me
they don't have a name.

32:22.408 --> 32:25.177
But you may recognize
them individually.

32:25.211 --> 32:28.714
So give it up
for Gunnar Scott,

32:28.747 --> 32:32.351
Will Lexington
and Avery Barkley.

32:32.384 --> 32:33.585
Come on!

32:34.653 --> 32:35.721
Hey, that's lame!

32:35.754 --> 32:37.389
Come on! Come on!

32:37.423 --> 32:43.229
Yeah! Yeah!

32:43.262 --> 32:44.496
You know, we're still
all getting

32:44.530 --> 32:46.732
our, uh, our feet
wet together here.

32:46.765 --> 32:49.401
So we're just gonna
play y'all the hits.

32:53.439 --> 32:56.475
* Hey, stop the world
and let me off *

32:56.508 --> 32:58.477
* Stop the world
and let me off *

32:58.510 --> 33:01.280
* I'm tired of going
round and round *

33:01.313 --> 33:03.615
* Stop the world
and let me off *

33:03.649 --> 33:06.352
* I've played the game
of love and lost *

33:06.385 --> 33:08.720
* Stop the world
and let me off *

33:08.754 --> 33:11.623
* So stop the world
and let me off *

33:11.657 --> 33:14.460
* Stop the world
and let me off *

33:14.493 --> 33:17.096
* My heart is shattered,
can't you see *

33:18.697 --> 33:23.635
* 'Cause you no longer
care for me *

33:23.669 --> 33:29.275
* But someday I hope
you'll see *

33:29.308 --> 33:34.113
* Loving you don't rescue me

33:34.146 --> 33:37.116
* Hey, stop the world
and let me off *

33:37.149 --> 33:39.485
* Stop the world
and let me off *

33:39.518 --> 33:41.820
* I'm tired of going
round and round *

33:41.853 --> 33:44.423
* Stop the world
and let me off *

33:44.456 --> 33:47.393
* I've played the game of
love and lost *

33:47.426 --> 33:49.561
* Stop the world
and let me off *

33:49.595 --> 33:52.264
* So stop the world
and let me off *

33:52.298 --> 33:55.033
* Stop the world
and let me off *

33:57.369 --> 34:00.339
* Doodelee-doodelee
doodelee-doo *

34:02.541 --> 34:05.077
* Doodelee-doodelee
doodelee-doo *

34:05.111 --> 34:09.548
* My dream world tumbled
to the ground *

34:09.581 --> 34:14.586
* The one I love
has let me down *

34:14.620 --> 34:19.825
* I lost the wonder
of her kiss *

34:19.858 --> 34:25.097
* How could she leave me
here like this *

34:25.131 --> 34:28.234
* Hey, stop the world
and let me off *

34:28.267 --> 34:30.636
* Stop the world
and let me off *

34:30.669 --> 34:33.139
* I'm tired of going
round and round *

34:33.172 --> 34:35.674
* Stop the world
and let me off *

34:35.707 --> 34:38.277
* I've played the game
of love and lost *

34:38.310 --> 34:40.512
* Stop the world and
let me off

34:40.546 --> 34:43.182
* So stop the world
and let me off *

34:43.215 --> 34:45.651
* Stop the world and
let me off *

34:51.757 --> 34:52.858
Did you see?

34:52.891 --> 34:54.226
Woo!

34:54.260 --> 34:55.727
Yeah

35:17.416 --> 35:18.817
Well, that was a...

35:19.885 --> 35:22.288
Fun, failed experiment.

35:23.489 --> 35:24.590
Yeah.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.461
Guess to know it doesn't work,
you gotta give it a try, right?

35:29.495 --> 35:31.129
Yeah, good point.

35:33.565 --> 35:34.600
Yeah.

35:36.435 --> 35:38.837
- All right. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

36:13.339 --> 36:14.673
Coffee's on the counter.

36:16.408 --> 36:19.845
Hey, buddy, you want
in on some of these pancakes?

36:19.878 --> 36:21.580
Oh, pancakes, yeah.

36:21.613 --> 36:23.549
We are not in our
early 20s anymore.

36:23.582 --> 36:27.319
Yeah, I can manage exactly
one night like that a year.

36:27.353 --> 36:28.954
I was thinking more
like once a week.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.622
What do you mean?

36:30.656 --> 36:32.258
Just admit it, Ave.
You had fun.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.692
Come on, you did.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.794
Okay, maybe I had
a little fun.

36:35.827 --> 36:37.463
Well, then
we should do this.

36:37.496 --> 36:38.897
Yeah. You saw how that
audience reacted.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.766
We got to.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.534
You're talking about
like a super group?

36:42.568 --> 36:45.871
We're just making music
and having fun.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.473
That's what we do.

36:47.506 --> 36:48.740
Hey.

36:48.774 --> 36:50.842
We're a band.
We share everything.

36:57.749 --> 36:58.917
Yes? Come in.

37:00.419 --> 37:01.720
Come in.

37:01.753 --> 37:04.856
Just wanted to say hi
briefly before I go.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.493
I'm sorry we didn't get
to spend much time together

37:07.526 --> 37:08.727
during your stay.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.797
But I thought it might
be instructive.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.565
Instructive how?

37:15.401 --> 37:19.805
Unlearning traps of
instant gratification,

37:19.838 --> 37:21.507
dealing with disappointment.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.642
I don't like mind games.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.544
I understand that.

37:27.479 --> 37:30.682
Do you feel like
maybe you, I don't know,

37:30.716 --> 37:32.017
learned something?

37:32.050 --> 37:34.820
Did you feel present?
In control?

37:34.853 --> 37:36.722
I did, yeah.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.525
Can I just ask then
what are you returning to?

37:39.558 --> 37:42.394
My family, for one.
My career.

37:42.428 --> 37:43.962
People so close to you,

37:43.995 --> 37:46.632
they're invested in you staying
exactly the way you are.

37:46.665 --> 37:47.999
What does that mean?

37:48.033 --> 37:49.835
It means there's a dynamic.

37:51.503 --> 37:53.905
You feel compelled to
dominate every interaction

37:53.939 --> 37:55.941
and the people around you
are more than happy

37:55.974 --> 37:57.876
to genuflect and submit.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.745
I don't have
to act that way.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.613
No, you don't.

38:01.647 --> 38:05.083
But it's hard to break old
habits in old environments.

38:05.116 --> 38:08.954
One needs distance,
structure.

38:08.987 --> 38:11.022
So you're saying that
I shouldn't leave.

38:11.056 --> 38:12.824
I'm saying be mindful.

38:12.858 --> 38:15.327
Am I falling back
into my old ways?

38:15.361 --> 38:19.064
Am I truly happy
here and now?

38:20.532 --> 38:21.733
That's all.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.014
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:39.451 --> 38:40.852
You know,
if you don't want to talk,

38:40.886 --> 38:42.654
I can keep shopping or...
- That's okay.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.890
It's been too long.
Feels weird.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.558
Yeah.

38:46.592 --> 38:47.659
I can't remember
the last time I didn't know

38:47.693 --> 38:48.994
what was going on in your life.

38:49.027 --> 38:50.896
I know.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.698
Well, you first.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.500
What's new?

38:54.533 --> 38:59.104
Well, I been playing out with
the guys a bit, Will and Avery.

38:59.137 --> 39:01.139
Oh, really?

39:01.172 --> 39:04.643
I mean, I don't know if it's
gonna be a real thing, but...

39:04.676 --> 39:06.077
I think it's great.

39:06.111 --> 39:08.013
You do?

39:08.046 --> 39:10.348
Yeah. I'm happy you found
something that's right for you.

39:12.518 --> 39:13.952
Well, what about you?

39:13.985 --> 39:14.953
You been playing?

39:14.986 --> 39:16.822
A little bit.

39:16.855 --> 39:20.892
Thinking about taking a break
from it all just for a minute.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.428
Oh.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.630
What?

39:24.663 --> 39:25.964
Oh, nothing. It's just...

39:28.133 --> 39:30.101
You got the most beautiful
voice I've ever heard.

39:30.135 --> 39:31.770
And I'd hate to think
you're not singing.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.672
Thanks.

39:33.705 --> 39:37.676
It just, it's started to feel
like an obligation.

39:37.709 --> 39:41.647
Like something I had to do
to help people like Nadine.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.982
You remember that girl?
- Yeah.

39:44.015 --> 39:46.852
Yeah, I had this moment
where I realized

39:46.885 --> 39:49.421
it wasn't just my music
that helped people.

39:49.455 --> 39:54.125
It was me and stuff
that I decided to do.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.795
And it made me think that,
for every person who says

39:56.828 --> 39:59.765
a song changed their life,
there's like a thousand more

39:59.798 --> 40:01.533
people who just change
the radio station.

40:01.567 --> 40:05.637
So I wanted to do
something more direct.

40:05.671 --> 40:07.138
Get some dirt
under my fingernails.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.140
It's just where
my heart is at right now.

40:09.174 --> 40:13.011
Well, then I'm really happy
for you too, honestly.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.713
Thank you.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.592
It's good to see you.

40:26.625 --> 40:27.959
You, too.

40:39.738 --> 40:41.607
All right, kiddo.
Ace that test.

40:41.640 --> 40:42.741
Don't jinx it.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.175
Sorry. Fail it.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.477
Much better.
Thank you.

40:45.511 --> 40:47.012
Love you, too.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.246
- Morning.
- Hi.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.881
Hey, guys.

40:51.883 --> 40:54.019
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.053
Long time, no see.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.255
Yeah, totally.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.957
Hey, Daphne.
- Hi.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.125
How you feeling
about algebra?

41:00.158 --> 41:01.727
Fine, thank you.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.495
Mmm. Good.

41:03.529 --> 41:04.496
- We should catch up sometime.
- Yeah, totally.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.599
Oh, well, that's
my cue to go, I guess.

41:07.633 --> 41:09.200
Please, miss, you're
blocking the traffic.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.803
All right, I'll see you later.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.238
Break a leg, honey.

41:13.271 --> 41:14.706
Yeah. Whatever.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.025
Sorry!

41:36.327 --> 41:39.097
He shoots, he scores!

41:48.940 --> 41:51.176
You're back.

41:51.209 --> 41:53.144
Yeah.

41:53.178 --> 41:54.245
So how'd it go?
