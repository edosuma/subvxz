00:16.550 --> 00:19.953
My grandfather is one of the
wealthiest men in the New World.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.689
If I plead our case
and gain his support,

00:21.789 --> 00:24.425
that might be all we need
to emerge from this intact.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.595
I alone am to be left in
charge of Nassau's security.

00:27.679 --> 00:30.272
And I gave our lord
governor my solemn oath

00:30.297 --> 00:31.674
that I would see it protected.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.068
Israel Hands.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.270
It's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.038
- You want to withdraw?
- If we don't,

00:38.139 --> 00:40.074
it will be the end of
whatever trust exists

00:40.174 --> 00:41.975
between us and the slaves on the island.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.949
I'm through following you down a path

00:43.974 --> 00:45.170
only you seem able to see.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.747
Fire!

00:49.183 --> 00:51.587
The neighboring estates must've
heard the guns and rallied.

00:51.612 --> 00:53.454
We need to be gone before
that militia arrives.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.648
I board the sloop and I run.

00:55.673 --> 00:58.383
The door will be open for you to reach
your grandfather and gain his aid.

00:58.408 --> 01:00.767
- It's the governor's banner.
- Do we pursue?

01:00.943 --> 01:03.204
Set a course to overtake her.

03:01.899 --> 03:03.466
Captain?

03:07.057 --> 03:08.892
I would've thought you'd retired by now.

03:10.227 --> 03:11.751
Bulletins...

03:12.152 --> 03:14.789
from my scouts in the field tonight.

03:15.383 --> 03:18.168
I was contemplating my
response after the sunrise.

03:19.628 --> 03:21.758
Anything we should discuss?

03:22.906 --> 03:25.543
You have enough on your mind.

03:25.834 --> 03:28.170
Let this be my concern.

03:35.901 --> 03:37.931
Have you told her, my Lord?

03:39.590 --> 03:41.441
Your wife.

03:42.188 --> 03:44.324
About what lies ahead?

03:50.601 --> 03:52.570
Good.

03:52.799 --> 03:55.802
She doesn't need it
on her mind, either...

03:57.741 --> 04:00.077
what lies ahead.

04:08.351 --> 04:12.255
I have found that
contemplating these things

04:12.355 --> 04:14.592
is the most difficult part.

04:14.971 --> 04:18.666
That when the dread moment arrives,

04:18.869 --> 04:21.665
your true nature will assert itself.

04:22.438 --> 04:24.602
The confusion will lift

04:24.812 --> 04:27.899
and all will appear as it should be.

04:30.173 --> 04:32.342
You've given me good men to lead.

04:33.210 --> 04:35.179
I'll do my best by them.

04:40.383 --> 04:43.921
There isn't a good man among them.

04:44.972 --> 04:46.688
Not anymore.

04:48.826 --> 04:52.863
Some of them may have
been, before all this.

04:53.897 --> 04:56.133
Some of them may be again

04:56.233 --> 04:57.727
on the other side of it.

04:58.641 --> 05:01.705
But right now,

05:01.805 --> 05:06.710
good men are not what
the moment requires.

05:08.746 --> 05:10.648
Right now,

05:10.681 --> 05:13.375
the time calls for dark men...

05:13.734 --> 05:16.593
to do dark things.

05:18.483 --> 05:21.586
Do not be afraid to lead them to it.

05:36.192 --> 05:38.275
Prepare for departure!

05:43.814 --> 05:45.916
Today is the 24th.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.035
David is five today.

05:53.156 --> 05:54.837
My son.

05:56.694 --> 05:58.361
I didn't know that.

06:00.454 --> 06:03.901
Mr. Grandal has not
contacted me in weeks.

06:04.352 --> 06:08.241
With the war apparently occupying
Spain's attention elsewhere,

06:08.804 --> 06:11.541
there is a good chance the
entire unfortunate affair

06:11.566 --> 06:13.905
surrounding the Spanish
gold is behind us.

06:14.179 --> 06:15.921
So, when we reach Philadelphia,

06:15.946 --> 06:18.485
once you are under the
protection of your family...

06:21.719 --> 06:25.723
I was hoping you might see fit
to release me from my service,

06:26.204 --> 06:28.759
that I might return to London...

06:29.902 --> 06:31.604
to my children.

06:33.396 --> 06:35.065
Of course.

06:39.694 --> 06:41.261
Ma'am...

06:44.042 --> 06:47.044
I've just been informed our permission
to depart has been suspended.

06:47.144 --> 06:48.779
Suspended? Why?

06:48.840 --> 06:51.109
I'm told the soldiers that
were to comprise your escort

06:51.134 --> 06:52.891
are otherwise needed ashore.

07:15.172 --> 07:16.874
What the fuck is this?

07:16.899 --> 07:19.474
- Get out.
- Get dressed.

07:50.353 --> 07:52.418
Mr. Harrison,

07:52.873 --> 07:54.466
proceed.

07:58.448 --> 08:00.512
Six men with you.

08:00.951 --> 08:04.054
They never looked my way as I
stayed a considerable distance.

08:05.188 --> 08:07.825
Saw you meet two others late last night,

08:08.402 --> 08:10.427
one of them standing on just one leg.

08:11.249 --> 08:13.080
Saw it all.

08:13.893 --> 08:16.133
I had him follow you

08:16.466 --> 08:20.136
after you left town
so abruptly last night.

08:21.872 --> 08:26.009
I assume the one-legged
man was Long John Silver.

08:27.921 --> 08:31.124
Would you like to tell me
what the meeting was about?

08:32.149 --> 08:33.851
I was summoned by him

08:33.951 --> 08:37.561
in a failed attempt to
extort money from me.

08:38.355 --> 08:40.357
I would hope that your
spy also informed you

08:40.381 --> 08:42.851
that four of my six men
attempted to arrest him

08:42.876 --> 08:44.536
and died in the effort.

08:44.561 --> 08:46.930
I was barely able to escape myself.

08:47.420 --> 08:51.491
Surely this should mitigate any
doubt you may have about my loyalties.

08:52.635 --> 08:54.237
If you were loyal to the governor,

08:54.262 --> 08:57.415
why did you not inform me of
the meeting before the fact?

08:57.462 --> 09:00.077
If you are loyal to the governor,

09:00.665 --> 09:03.413
why attempt to arrest
a man as dangerous as he

09:03.513 --> 09:05.983
rather than simply eliminating him?

09:06.718 --> 09:08.185
If you had informed me,

09:08.285 --> 09:10.921
I'm sure I could have
helped in that regard.

09:11.093 --> 09:13.304
My questions about your loyalty, ma'am,

09:13.329 --> 09:15.492
are not mitigated by
last night's events.

09:15.592 --> 09:19.396
If anything, they are now
aggravated to an intolerable degree.

09:25.135 --> 09:28.338
Does the testimony presented
satisfy a charge of treason?

09:28.438 --> 09:30.718
- Wait.
- It does.

09:31.008 --> 09:32.375
This is outrageous.

09:32.475 --> 09:34.297
When the governor returns,
he will not stand for this.

09:34.322 --> 09:36.875
The governor is not here. I am here.

09:38.097 --> 09:40.617
And you are now under an indictment

09:40.717 --> 09:43.964
that carries with it
the penalty of death.

09:47.925 --> 09:51.228
Mr. Harrison here
trailed Long John Silver

09:51.253 --> 09:53.293
before losing him in the wrecks.

09:53.318 --> 09:55.265
Men and horse await in the square,

09:55.365 --> 09:58.635
preparing to clear that
area and apprehend him.

09:58.735 --> 10:02.239
Today is the day the
pirate resistance dies,

10:02.339 --> 10:03.873
its leader eliminated,

10:03.898 --> 10:07.081
its supporters in Nassau
exposed and arrested.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.147
If you cooperate with me to that end,

10:10.691 --> 10:14.240
perhaps your death
might still be averted.

10:20.475 --> 10:22.425
We have no choice but
to leave the island.

10:22.525 --> 10:24.461
No one is leaving anything.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.625
We came here to take Nassau.

10:26.650 --> 10:28.873
We leave once that
is done or not at all.

10:28.898 --> 10:31.211
Take Nassau?

10:31.368 --> 10:33.141
With what army?

10:33.555 --> 10:36.073
Whatever slaves are
still alive on this island

10:36.098 --> 10:39.420
will never fight
alongside a pirate again.

10:39.445 --> 10:41.219
- Not after last night.
- Last night,

10:41.244 --> 10:43.513
there were also pirates
who fought alongside us.

10:43.613 --> 10:46.102
Against terrible odds and at great cost.

10:46.127 --> 10:49.386
Billy and his men are our enemies
now, but these men are not.

10:49.486 --> 10:52.622
And as long as that is true,
our alliance with them holds.

11:00.111 --> 11:01.831
You know where you're going?

11:02.074 --> 11:04.209
I saw her last employed in the tavern.

11:04.234 --> 11:05.902
I'll begin there.

11:06.162 --> 11:09.191
We don't need to persuade
her to do anything yet.

11:09.216 --> 11:11.174
Eventually, we'll need to garner support

11:11.274 --> 11:15.645
to help incite Nassau to
revolt against the governor,

11:15.670 --> 11:18.115
but what we need right
now is information.

11:18.215 --> 11:20.150
How many soldiers there are,

11:20.175 --> 11:23.463
what kind of sympathy
exists for our cause.

11:23.488 --> 11:24.923
I know.

11:28.091 --> 11:29.392
Thank you.

11:30.132 --> 11:33.296
- What for?
- Last night.

11:33.396 --> 11:35.432
You did not have to side with me.

11:35.457 --> 11:37.425
It was costly for you to do so.

11:37.450 --> 11:41.038
Well, it would have cost far
more for me not to have done so.

11:41.138 --> 11:43.240
We might be able to take Nassau alone,

11:43.340 --> 11:46.543
but there will be no greater
victory, no widespread revolution

11:46.643 --> 11:50.247
unless we can somehow
keep our alliance together.

11:51.494 --> 11:53.924
You truly believe it is possible?

11:54.502 --> 11:57.814
That as disadvantaged
and disabled as we are,

11:58.338 --> 11:59.689
that anything we do here

11:59.789 --> 12:02.596
is going to make the least bit of
difference to the men in London?

12:04.480 --> 12:06.353
Well, that's the trick, isn't it?

12:06.924 --> 12:09.466
If no one remembers a time
before there was an England,

12:09.491 --> 12:12.632
then no one can imagine a time after it.

12:12.657 --> 12:14.637
The empire survives in part

12:14.662 --> 12:17.732
because we believe its
survival to be inevitable.

12:18.075 --> 12:19.709
But it isn't.

12:20.746 --> 12:22.481
And they know that.

12:23.680 --> 12:26.474
That's why they're so
terrified of you and I.

12:27.550 --> 12:29.519
If we were able to take Nassau,

12:31.156 --> 12:33.601
if we are able to expose the illusion

12:33.626 --> 12:36.052
that England is not inevitable,

12:36.687 --> 12:38.961
if we are able to incite a revolt

12:38.986 --> 12:41.088
that spreads across the New World...

12:43.084 --> 12:44.753
then, yeah...

12:46.680 --> 12:49.273
I imagine people are gonna notice.

12:51.866 --> 12:54.511
"Too much sanity may be madness,

12:54.875 --> 12:56.977
"and the maddest of all,

12:57.002 --> 13:00.315
"to see life as it is
and not as it should be."

13:29.512 --> 13:31.411
Get the main sail.

13:31.973 --> 13:34.751
I'll say this for him, he's not shy.

13:34.851 --> 13:38.054
If he misses this tack, we'll
be on him in less than an hour.

13:38.691 --> 13:41.424
He's completed his last
three tacks. Why stop now?

13:41.524 --> 13:43.231
Not that close to the wind.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.918
Not nearly that close.

13:45.114 --> 13:46.748
Don't you think?

13:47.707 --> 13:50.121
Any chance he could slip away from us?

13:50.367 --> 13:51.668
- Not really, no.
- No.

13:54.003 --> 13:55.638
He's pointing higher,
but we've got the speed.

13:55.663 --> 13:57.565
He can't hold us off forever.

13:57.863 --> 13:59.776
Once we've stopped him,

13:59.876 --> 14:02.512
you and I will take the
vanguard aboard on longboats.

14:02.862 --> 14:06.431
You can stay close, provide
support until we're boarded.

14:07.284 --> 14:09.507
Ever captained a ship
of this size before?

14:09.532 --> 14:10.833
God, no.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.536
Have you captained a
ship this size before?

14:16.226 --> 14:17.727
- Sure.
- Good.

14:25.368 --> 14:27.404
This ain't ever gonna end for us, is it?

14:28.038 --> 14:29.460
What?

14:29.728 --> 14:32.367
You always wanted to
stand next to giants.

14:32.722 --> 14:34.557
Now there you are.

14:35.845 --> 14:39.633
And I'm wondering how it is you and
I are ever gonna move on from this.

14:45.388 --> 14:47.290
He's brilliant, you know?

14:47.390 --> 14:49.554
I've heard him
underestimated on that score,

14:49.579 --> 14:51.601
perhaps owing to his physical strength.

14:51.626 --> 14:53.531
People finding it
hard to accept the idea

14:53.556 --> 14:55.100
that one man can be two things,

14:55.125 --> 14:56.561
but I've seen it.

14:56.940 --> 14:58.710
He is brilliant.

15:00.870 --> 15:03.773
And last night, all
he wanted was revenge,

15:03.873 --> 15:06.843
and all that would satisfy it was
Eleanor Guthrie's head on a plate.

15:06.868 --> 15:10.999
And in a moment in which he had no
appetite to be persuaded otherwise,

15:11.024 --> 15:12.615
I persuaded him otherwise.

15:14.902 --> 15:17.915
If the story of the pirate Jack Rackham

15:18.329 --> 15:21.960
is to end with him standing
alongside Blackbeard as an equal,

15:21.985 --> 15:24.514
together defeating the
governor who hanged Charles Vane

15:24.539 --> 15:28.474
and in so doing restoring
pirate rule over Nassau...

15:33.670 --> 15:36.339
that is an ending I can live with.

15:39.516 --> 15:41.351
Defeat Rogers...

15:42.087 --> 15:43.977
and we walk away.

15:46.805 --> 15:48.874
They've missed stays!

15:48.899 --> 15:50.901
We've got him.

15:51.390 --> 15:53.611
Ready the guns!

15:56.133 --> 15:58.468
The end is about to begin.

16:02.465 --> 16:04.600
Our invasion failed.

16:06.122 --> 16:07.790
But we are not through.

16:08.878 --> 16:11.757
There is support for
our cause inside Nassau.

16:11.999 --> 16:14.517
There must be, however dormant.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.129
But we need to find it.

16:17.154 --> 16:19.271
Need your help to find it.

16:19.296 --> 16:21.158
There was support once,

16:21.224 --> 16:25.536
but now Nassau is frightened.

16:25.561 --> 16:29.647
What you would ask, openly
defying those soldiers...

16:30.688 --> 16:32.924
I doubt you'd find that kind of support.

16:36.146 --> 16:40.379
I have lost more than you
can know to reach this moment.

16:40.404 --> 16:42.582
Captain Flint has lost
more than you can know.

16:42.607 --> 16:44.716
- But we are here.
- Captain Flint?

16:45.029 --> 16:47.537
He awaits with a small force of men.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.902
But if we can see those
prisoners broken free...

16:49.927 --> 16:52.422
And you are with him as well?

16:52.522 --> 16:53.990
Yes?

16:54.631 --> 16:57.260
Him... who?

16:58.008 --> 16:59.873
Long John Silver.

17:02.562 --> 17:05.798
He died in the bay

17:05.823 --> 17:07.492
during the invasion.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.483
What?

17:12.849 --> 17:15.608
A posse just departed for the wrecks

17:15.646 --> 17:18.012
under instructions
from Captain Berringer

17:18.037 --> 17:21.450
to locate and arrest Long John Silver.

17:31.809 --> 17:33.778
Are you all right, ma'am?

17:37.834 --> 17:39.595
Ma'am?

17:45.642 --> 17:47.344
Fuck.

17:47.760 --> 17:50.621
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
- That's enough.

17:50.713 --> 17:52.415
We should be running.

17:52.768 --> 17:54.717
There's nowhere to run.

17:54.817 --> 17:56.753
Then we have a serious problem,

17:56.853 --> 17:58.954
as Captain Berringer is going to demand

17:58.979 --> 18:02.149
she identify her connections
to the resistance, which is us.

18:02.174 --> 18:03.593
She won't.

18:04.177 --> 18:05.395
How can you be so sure?

18:05.495 --> 18:08.121
Because she doesn't like
her friends being threatened.

18:08.146 --> 18:09.899
And she doesn't like
to be pushed around.

18:09.999 --> 18:11.901
I sincerely hope you're right,

18:12.001 --> 18:14.271
as I believe our lives depend upon it.

18:14.997 --> 18:17.107
She won't tell on us in there.

18:17.599 --> 18:19.287
What we should be worried about

18:19.312 --> 18:21.660
is how we're going to
help her from out here.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.581
Fuck.

18:28.276 --> 18:30.262
The other day,

18:30.287 --> 18:32.655
you refused to name the source you used

18:32.755 --> 18:35.492
to undermine the pirate
invasion of the bay...

18:36.949 --> 18:38.994
as a matter of principle.

18:42.096 --> 18:45.768
Since that time, Long John
Silver and his associates

18:45.868 --> 18:48.538
have murdered one of my men...

18:49.384 --> 18:51.952
murdered four of your men...

18:53.468 --> 18:56.865
murdered a family of three
on the Underhill estate

18:56.890 --> 18:58.415
in cold blood last night,

18:58.515 --> 19:00.450
including an eight-year-old girl.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.688
Knowing now how high
the bodies are piling,

19:05.788 --> 19:08.325
how real the threat is,

19:09.018 --> 19:12.161
I am giving you an opportunity
to remedy your error

19:12.186 --> 19:15.676
and help me end this
threat once and for all.

19:20.970 --> 19:23.806
I want the names of your sources.

19:28.364 --> 19:30.366
I am sorry,

19:30.411 --> 19:32.447
but I cannot do that.

19:32.820 --> 19:35.689
Cannot or will not?

19:36.386 --> 19:39.221
These men would turn on
you in a blink of an eye.

19:39.356 --> 19:42.498
Why would you go to such
lengths to protect them?

19:42.553 --> 19:44.443
I told you,

19:44.719 --> 19:46.853
I have an understanding
with the governor...

19:46.929 --> 19:48.248
- ... in which he acknowledged...
- Give me the names.

19:48.273 --> 19:50.807
... the benefit of my being
able to honor my word...

19:50.832 --> 19:52.058
- ... to my sources...
- Give me the names.

19:52.134 --> 19:53.511
- ... such that I might continue...
- Give me the names.

19:53.536 --> 19:54.972
- to serve his regime in the future...
- Give me the names.

19:54.997 --> 19:56.674
- ... as I have served it every day...
- Give me the names.

19:56.699 --> 19:58.964
- ... until now.
- Give me the names!

20:04.939 --> 20:06.994
You can't go in there, ma'am.

20:08.485 --> 20:10.431
What is going on here?

20:19.629 --> 20:21.165
Go!

20:53.372 --> 20:55.206
I'm not shackled.

20:56.770 --> 20:58.806
You plan to run?

21:01.838 --> 21:03.673
Do I need to run?

21:06.171 --> 21:08.789
That'd be fun for me to see.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.415
How would you do it?

21:14.083 --> 21:17.063
With great difficulty, I imagine.

21:18.003 --> 21:20.157
How would you take Nassau?

21:23.570 --> 21:25.262
When I did it...

21:26.896 --> 21:29.031
drove the governor away,

21:29.239 --> 21:33.503
I had Teach and an army of
my once-brothers at my back.

21:33.603 --> 21:35.472
You want to play Teach?

21:36.573 --> 21:38.597
Who's to play the rest?

21:40.299 --> 21:43.837
Or do you believe we
two could do it alone?

22:00.937 --> 22:03.282
Find him!

22:09.744 --> 22:11.234
Look over there!

22:15.035 --> 22:16.112
Find him!

22:17.539 --> 22:18.940
Right. Over there!

22:19.450 --> 22:21.441
Behind them. Check the brush!

22:26.248 --> 22:27.557
Find him!

22:27.812 --> 22:29.412
Search that wreck!

22:29.437 --> 22:30.576
Get in there!

23:03.760 --> 23:05.227
It's all right.

23:06.148 --> 23:08.625
How are we going to take Nassau?

23:08.867 --> 23:10.800
That's how.

23:32.291 --> 23:33.364
Cease fire!

23:33.389 --> 23:34.893
Cease firing!

23:34.918 --> 23:36.720
Shall we reload, Captain?

23:40.730 --> 23:42.899
There's nothing more
we can do from here.

23:45.131 --> 23:47.013
They're on their own now.

26:48.851 --> 26:51.040
They've struck their colors!

27:23.019 --> 27:25.254
She is the most influential
member of the Governor's Council.

27:25.354 --> 27:26.488
Whatever tension there has been,

27:26.588 --> 27:27.870
he relies upon her to maintain control.

27:27.895 --> 27:29.165
Ma'am.

27:29.190 --> 27:30.827
If when the governor does return

27:30.893 --> 27:32.829
I have to explain to
him that I discovered

27:32.895 --> 27:35.077
the most influential
member of his council

27:35.102 --> 27:37.016
conspiring with our enemies

27:37.041 --> 27:38.959
and took action to stop her,

27:39.105 --> 27:42.208
that is an explanation
I will offer happily.

27:43.405 --> 27:45.141
Now, I apologize for the delay

27:45.241 --> 27:47.299
in your transport to Philadelphia.

27:47.324 --> 27:50.346
The men were most needed
to address today's crisis.

27:50.446 --> 27:52.248
Please trust I will have you on your way

27:52.348 --> 27:54.795
by the time the sun rises tomorrow.

28:05.935 --> 28:08.200
I explained the situation to him.

28:08.225 --> 28:10.910
He's in no mood to be
reasoned with on the issue.

28:11.020 --> 28:13.161
You saw him, Silver?

28:13.208 --> 28:15.283
What happened?

28:15.630 --> 28:17.439
It was him and one other.

28:17.832 --> 28:19.876
I had six men.

28:20.347 --> 28:22.879
I thought it would be sufficient
to apprehend him myself.

28:22.952 --> 28:24.418
Apprehend him?

28:24.443 --> 28:25.913
No one asked you to apprehend him.

28:25.948 --> 28:27.999
All you had to do was
report the invitation to meet

28:28.024 --> 28:29.411
and let the captain handle it.

28:29.436 --> 28:31.677
How in God's name did
that not occur to you?

28:31.702 --> 28:33.718
I did not fail to do it.

28:34.280 --> 28:37.226
I refused to do it and would again.

28:37.326 --> 28:39.999
Why would you refuse
to adhere to the law?

28:41.497 --> 28:43.869
Because the last time the law

28:43.894 --> 28:46.426
got its hands on a
pirate of that stature,

28:46.502 --> 28:49.040
it yielded the following...

28:49.087 --> 28:53.009
anger, hostility, resentment,

28:53.376 --> 28:57.446
purges to combat it all that only
resulted in amplifying it all,

28:57.546 --> 29:01.383
and a resistance movement that,
since Captain Vane was hanged,

29:01.408 --> 29:03.728
has done nothing but grow strong enough

29:03.753 --> 29:07.157
to control almost every part of
this island outside of Nassau.

29:08.190 --> 29:10.092
And you ask why I chose

29:10.192 --> 29:12.898
not to help start the
cycle all over again?

29:12.923 --> 29:14.423
There is a ship in the bay

29:14.448 --> 29:16.107
that is supposed to
be taking me to a place

29:16.132 --> 29:18.570
where I might actually
solve our problems here.

29:18.595 --> 29:21.938
But instead, I am stuck here for
as long as it takes to fix this.

29:22.004 --> 29:23.393
In order to do that,

29:23.418 --> 29:25.939
you are going to have to give
me something to fix it with.

29:26.072 --> 29:28.044
But you'd better come up with
something of value I can use

29:28.144 --> 29:30.260
to get him to walk away from this.

29:31.873 --> 29:34.337
You think you can control him.

29:35.952 --> 29:39.821
And by the time you realize
he has been controlling you,

29:40.134 --> 29:42.358
it is going to be too late.

29:42.533 --> 29:45.198
Riders returning!

29:55.480 --> 29:56.948
Give me something I can use

29:56.973 --> 29:59.343
because otherwise I can't help you.

29:59.703 --> 30:02.827
And I beg your pardon, but what
the fuck have you got to lose?

30:14.056 --> 30:16.825
- What happened?
- Fugitive escaped.

30:16.925 --> 30:18.260
Though, not before
killing three of my men

30:18.360 --> 30:20.196
and fixing that to one of the bodies.

30:23.685 --> 30:25.533
What does it say?

30:29.613 --> 30:31.682
"To the men and women of Nassau,

30:31.707 --> 30:35.766
"the strength of the governor's
force is now reduced by three.

30:36.523 --> 30:39.838
"The time to lend us
your efforts is now.

30:40.549 --> 30:43.432
"See my brothers held captive freed.

30:44.469 --> 30:47.738
"Join them. Join me.

30:48.752 --> 30:51.660
"Signed, Long John Silver."

30:53.615 --> 30:54.923
You heard him.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.634
The time is now.

31:01.103 --> 31:04.573
Who among you would like to lend
his efforts to Long John Silver

31:04.673 --> 31:06.375
and resist me?

31:12.248 --> 31:13.549
Here.

31:17.595 --> 31:19.330
I am unarmed.

31:21.090 --> 31:23.359
No one will stand in your way.

31:26.360 --> 31:30.664
If the time isn't now, when
the fuck is it going to be?!

31:33.369 --> 31:34.795
None of you?!

31:37.309 --> 31:39.443
No one at all?!

31:55.691 --> 31:58.327
You fucking cowards.

32:25.165 --> 32:26.697
I don't understand.

32:26.955 --> 32:28.724
- Billy.
- Yep.

32:28.824 --> 32:30.559
- Tried to kill you?
- Yep.

32:30.721 --> 32:33.291
- And Madi?
- Her, too.

32:34.305 --> 32:36.207
Why are we not angry about this?

32:36.232 --> 32:38.155
Who says we're not?

32:38.400 --> 32:41.437
Well, I'm not sensing a whole lot
of urgency to do anything about it.

32:41.537 --> 32:44.658
There isn't anything we can
do about it at the moment.

32:45.241 --> 32:46.442
Isn't there?

32:47.567 --> 32:49.571
Look, Billy's not stupid.

32:49.596 --> 32:51.613
He's almost certainly
consolidated by now,

32:51.713 --> 32:56.067
intimidated or eliminated anyone who
would challenge him or support me.

32:56.092 --> 32:58.129
He has control of the Underhill estate,

32:58.154 --> 33:00.662
control of the army that calls it home.

33:00.974 --> 33:04.526
There will be a time to
deal with him, but not now.

33:11.778 --> 33:13.332
This one, however.

33:16.701 --> 33:18.038
He's fine.

33:18.840 --> 33:20.740
If you'd asked me yesterday,

33:20.765 --> 33:24.746
when he was considering selling
me to the governor for a profit,

33:24.882 --> 33:27.183
I'd be in agreement we
should be rid of him.

33:27.314 --> 33:30.556
But now, I don't know.

33:30.581 --> 33:33.327
I feel like we need as
much help as we can...

33:35.337 --> 33:37.201
get.

34:13.703 --> 34:16.864
Execution of the pirate
prisoners is scheduled for today.

34:16.965 --> 34:19.301
Captain Berringer stood in the square

34:19.400 --> 34:22.572
and said if Long John Silver
had a problem with this,

34:22.597 --> 34:25.617
he was welcome to show
himself and voice it.

34:28.244 --> 34:30.466
Uh, even if we could get
through their outer defenses,

34:30.498 --> 34:33.356
10 of us walk into town against
what could be 100 soldiers.

34:33.380 --> 34:34.913
And then what?

34:37.518 --> 34:39.355
The threats have been
made. The story's been told.

34:39.455 --> 34:41.061
Everyone in Nassau knows

34:41.085 --> 34:44.068
what Long John Silver's return means,

34:44.099 --> 34:47.045
what's expected of them
when he does return.

34:48.216 --> 34:50.139
All that remains to do...

34:50.164 --> 34:52.092
is for him to return.

34:55.748 --> 34:58.162
It would help if Nassau
knew I was coming.

34:58.488 --> 35:00.279
Can you see to it?

35:01.121 --> 35:03.023
Of course.

35:12.621 --> 35:14.423
Ooh, lovely.

35:15.802 --> 35:18.136
I don't make this request lightly.

35:18.402 --> 35:21.344
But after everything Max
has done for the council,

35:21.699 --> 35:23.334
for you,

35:23.359 --> 35:26.543
it seems like a moment when
she's owed something back.

35:26.711 --> 35:30.748
The charges against her are
of the utmost seriousness.

35:30.848 --> 35:33.019
It sounds as if the
law is being adhered to.

35:33.044 --> 35:35.652
And what standing do
we have to interfere?

35:35.668 --> 35:37.870
People are angry, Mr. Frasier.

35:37.970 --> 35:40.339
At the soldiers, at Captain Berringer.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.570
Some of them even at our lord governor.

35:42.645 --> 35:45.585
You may not see it, but trust me, I do.

35:47.335 --> 35:50.282
If the council won't resist the captain,

35:50.875 --> 35:54.807
then some of those people might find
their own ways of resisting this.

35:55.190 --> 35:57.432
Ways you might not like.

36:02.330 --> 36:04.793
Don't send for me again.

36:10.536 --> 36:11.971
Fuck.

36:15.849 --> 36:18.510
- What did he say?
- Nothing helpful.

36:21.243 --> 36:22.745
What's going on?

36:36.842 --> 36:39.115
You're about to make a terrible mistake

36:39.146 --> 36:41.200
and I am asking you to reconsider.

36:41.225 --> 36:44.745
I am entitled to exercise these
sentences at my discretion.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.572
But I'm not asking you
to cancel the hangings.

36:46.672 --> 36:48.878
I'm asking you to cancel
the theater around them.

36:52.089 --> 36:53.803
You intend to lure Silver in.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.148
Force him to appear in
the square to save his men

36:56.248 --> 36:58.551
so that you might defeat him
in full view of all of Nassau.

36:58.651 --> 37:00.560
Demonstrate your fearsomeness to them.

37:01.099 --> 37:02.606
Don't.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.442
- Why not?
- Because you don't need to.

37:06.576 --> 37:08.411
Because they know it already
and because at a certain point,

37:08.511 --> 37:10.861
there is only so much
fear a man can endure.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.182
All you are doing is antagonizing them.

37:13.383 --> 37:15.485
And who is that serving?

37:16.248 --> 37:19.056
Because there is a better
way to solve this problem.

37:21.945 --> 37:23.146
What is that?

37:23.171 --> 37:25.362
This is information
about the preferred routes

37:25.428 --> 37:28.116
used by the resistance
to enter into Nassau.

37:31.368 --> 37:33.900
- She gave it to you?
- She did.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.708
Send men to lie in wait.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.519
Set an ambush that can
overwhelm Silver and his men

37:49.619 --> 37:51.388
when they attempt to pass.

37:52.803 --> 37:55.400
End this quietly and easily

37:55.425 --> 37:57.394
and definitively.

38:36.478 --> 38:39.281
What do you imagine happens next?

38:40.514 --> 38:43.983
If you are fortunate
enough to capture Teach...

38:47.777 --> 38:50.060
what will you do with him?

38:55.452 --> 38:57.045
Years ago...

38:57.750 --> 39:00.262
as a privateer during the war,

39:00.287 --> 39:03.340
I was in a running fight
with a Spanish galleon.

39:03.365 --> 39:05.595
Hounded her for days.

39:06.162 --> 39:09.431
By all rights, she should've
surrendered long before she did.

39:11.668 --> 39:14.853
Just before her colors were
struck, a shot was fired.

39:16.642 --> 39:19.709
A cheap, cowardly shot...

39:21.326 --> 39:23.846
fired with the knowledge they
were about to surrender anyway

39:23.946 --> 39:27.326
and the presumption that
they be entitled to quarter.

39:29.334 --> 39:31.821
This particular shot found its mark.

39:33.390 --> 39:35.492
Took three of my men...

39:36.225 --> 39:38.826
one of them, my brother, Thomas.

39:41.872 --> 39:44.307
He'd always been smarter than me.

39:45.260 --> 39:46.962
Braver.

39:48.777 --> 39:50.380
Better.

39:51.641 --> 39:53.776
Protected me when we were young.

39:54.383 --> 39:56.979
Taught me to sail when we were older.

39:58.094 --> 40:00.336
He was my closest friend.

40:02.149 --> 40:06.656
Lost to a cheap and cowardly shot.

40:09.798 --> 40:12.734
So, after they surrendered,
I went aboard the ship.

40:14.870 --> 40:16.933
And I began with the captain.

40:21.597 --> 40:23.601
I was more deliberate with him.

40:25.808 --> 40:27.944
It took some time.

40:31.369 --> 40:33.673
Then I moved to his first mate.

40:35.818 --> 40:37.820
The gun captains.

40:39.184 --> 40:41.186
Gun crews.

40:44.141 --> 40:47.179
74 men aboard that
ship when I boarded her.

40:48.164 --> 40:51.500
But by the time we reached
Acapulco, there was only one.

40:53.999 --> 40:57.269
The one I delivered
alive to recount the tale.

41:09.617 --> 41:12.164
You asked what would happen next.

41:13.621 --> 41:16.925
My instinct is the
same now as it was then.

41:18.226 --> 41:20.428
I will show them what
the consequences are

41:20.528 --> 41:23.331
for threatening that
which I hold most dear.

41:25.705 --> 41:27.940
I will leave no doubt about it.

41:30.387 --> 41:31.557
Do it.

41:38.218 --> 41:39.538
Heave!

42:17.580 --> 42:18.959
Let's get the slack.

42:53.087 --> 42:54.094
Now.

42:54.178 --> 42:55.462
Pull!

43:29.395 --> 43:30.831
Pull it away!

43:32.365 --> 43:33.643
Hold him.

44:38.394 --> 44:39.495
Again.

44:40.632 --> 44:41.897
Again.

44:47.153 --> 44:48.833
Heave!

45:18.269 --> 45:20.481
- Heave!
- Get it out!

45:20.849 --> 45:22.751
Heave!

46:10.068 --> 46:11.570
Him next.

46:50.630 --> 46:52.165
Again!

46:52.190 --> 46:53.528
Again!

46:53.942 --> 46:55.645
Heave!

46:56.305 --> 46:58.107
Heave!

47:11.051 --> 47:12.318
Let fall.

49:05.198 --> 49:07.167
Can you see?

49:47.752 --> 49:49.471
Secure the rest of them.

49:50.475 --> 49:52.712
Set a course for Nassau.

49:52.812 --> 49:54.614
Raise sail!

50:22.669 --> 50:25.271
Keep moving. Don't drag your feet!

50:25.427 --> 50:26.728
Go on.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.427
Move it.

50:30.646 --> 50:32.113
Go on through.

51:08.888 --> 51:10.187
Sir...

51:25.438 --> 51:26.906
What did he say?

51:28.441 --> 51:30.776
Your men lying in wait
for Silver and his men,

51:30.876 --> 51:32.545
were they successful?

51:34.587 --> 51:36.175
Do it.

51:47.685 --> 51:49.863
There was no ambush set, was there?

51:51.597 --> 51:54.186
- I reconsidered.
- We had an agreement.

51:55.139 --> 51:57.236
Nassau will never fully come to heel

51:57.337 --> 52:00.288
until we can demonstrate control.

52:00.606 --> 52:02.508
And control that no one can see

52:02.608 --> 52:05.478
makes for no demonstration at all.

52:07.047 --> 52:09.681
So, I will let them see it.

52:13.181 --> 52:14.382
Remove them.

52:14.501 --> 52:16.303
Ready the next three.

52:16.602 --> 52:18.437
Take them down.

52:19.525 --> 52:20.860
Next three prisoners.

52:20.960 --> 52:22.628
You know Lieutenant Utley
from the captain's staff?

52:22.728 --> 52:23.963
- Yes.
- Find him.

52:23.988 --> 52:25.873
Tell him I ask that he gather
as much food and supplies

52:25.898 --> 52:27.346
as he can move into the
fort within the next hour.

52:27.371 --> 52:28.448
The fort?

52:28.473 --> 52:29.859
And tell him to gather six men he trusts

52:29.935 --> 52:31.704
to escort it and us up there.

52:31.804 --> 52:33.112
And tell him to get Max.

52:33.137 --> 52:34.580
Why do we need an escort to the fort?

52:34.605 --> 52:36.540
Quickly, please. We
don't have much time.

53:15.293 --> 53:16.895
They'll come.

53:40.493 --> 53:43.560
Company, fall into two ranks!

54:07.014 --> 54:08.428
Make ready!

54:15.834 --> 54:18.110
Present!

54:41.398 --> 54:42.950
Ready!

54:43.367 --> 54:44.870
- Fire!
- Fire!

54:56.887 --> 54:58.610
Charge!

55:16.902 --> 55:18.270
I need B Company!

55:18.295 --> 55:19.762
Fall back!

55:20.612 --> 55:22.708
B Company, make ready!

55:28.714 --> 55:30.883
Wait for my command!

55:30.908 --> 55:32.634
Mark your target!
