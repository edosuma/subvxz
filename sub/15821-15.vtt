19:27.165 --> 19:29.626
AND HIS MOTHER WAS
ACTUALLY BLOCKING HIM

19:29.710 --> 19:30.711
FROM GOING TO WARSAW.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.588
HOW WAS SHE BLOCKING HIM?

19:32.671 --> 19:34.882
MALIK DOESN'T...

19:35.924 --> 19:39.261
DIDN'T HAVE A PASSPORT.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.762
AND HIS MOTHER WOULDN'T
LET HIM APPLY

19:40.846 --> 19:42.764
TO THE LEBANESE EMBASSY
TO GET ONE.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.684
IT'S REALLY UNFAIR.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.936
RITA IS SUCH A BITCH.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.021
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?

19:49.104 --> 19:50.272
SHE HAS THIS
DYED BLONDE HAIR

19:50.355 --> 19:51.815
AND SHE WEARS
COSMETIC CONTACTS.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.276
SHE'S--SHE'S OBSESSED
WITH BLENDING IN.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.485
ONCE AFTER RECITAL,

19:55.569 --> 19:57.195
MALIK INTRODUCED HER
AS HIS MOTHER,

19:57.279 --> 19:58.780
AND SHE ACTUALLY TOOK
A STEP BACK,

19:58.864 --> 20:00.782
LIKE SHE WAS ASHAMED
OF HIM.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.784
AND SHE IS SUCH A LIAR.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.370
MALIK SAID SHE USED
TO LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.122
HE HATED HER.

20:07.205 --> 20:09.124
BUT DESPITE MALIK'S MOTHER,

20:09.207 --> 20:11.126
HE FOUND ANOTHER WAY
TO GET A PASSPORT.

20:11.209 --> 20:12.294
IS THAT IT?

20:12.377 --> 20:15.589
UH...NO.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.925
I MEAN, HE NEVER
SAID ANYTHING

20:18.008 --> 20:19.301
TO ME ABOUT THAT.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.511
SOMEONE WAS HELPING
MALIK GET

20:21.595 --> 20:24.473
A U.S. PASSPORT, ANGELA.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.266
REALLY?

20:35.734 --> 20:38.904
DOES THIS MEAN
ANYTHING TO YOU?

20:44.785 --> 20:49.247
UH...MALIK TOLD ME
NEVER TO TALK ABOUT IT.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.540
THAT IF I DID...

20:50.624 --> 20:52.084
IF THE WRONG PEOPLE
FOUND OUT

20:52.167 --> 20:57.172
THAT I HAD HELPED HIM,
THEN I MIGHT BE IN DANGER.

20:57.255 --> 20:58.799
WE'RE NOT
THE WRONG PEOPLE.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.842
AND YOU'RE IN DANGER
ANYWAY, ANGELA.

21:00.926 --> 21:04.179
EVEN MORE SO IF YOU DON'T
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

21:04.262 --> 21:07.432
MALIK TOLD ME
HE HAD MET SOMEONE

21:07.516 --> 21:09.017
WHO WAS GOING
TO HELP HIM BECOME

21:09.101 --> 21:10.769
AN AMERICAN CITIZEN,

21:10.852 --> 21:13.981
BUT THAT IT HADN'T
REALLY WORKED OUT.

21:14.064 --> 21:16.566
SO THEY WERE GONNA
MAYBE GO TO CANADA.

21:16.650 --> 21:21.780
AND THAT HE NEEDED
SOME WAY TO COMMUNICATE

21:21.863 --> 21:28.745
WITH THIS FRIEND SECRETLY.
SO HE WOULD...HE...

21:28.829 --> 21:32.040
HE WOULD OPEN UP THE BEAR,
PUT A MESSAGE INSIDE,

21:32.124 --> 21:35.377
CLOSE IT UP AGAIN,
AND PASS IT OFF TO YOU?

21:35.460 --> 21:39.131
AND YOU HANDED
THE BEAR OFF TO A PERSON?

21:39.214 --> 21:42.509
NO, I--I...I NEVER MET
ANYONE, EVER.

21:42.592 --> 21:44.469
I WOULD JUST--THE NEXT
DAY AFTER SCHOOL,

21:44.553 --> 21:46.555
I WOULD--I WOULD
DROP IT OFF,

21:46.638 --> 21:49.891
OR SEE IF ANYTHING HAD
BEEN LEFT FOR ME.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.394
I NEVER SAW ANYONE,
EVEN ONCE.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.105
AND WHERE DID YOU PICK UP
AND LEAVE THE BEAR?

21:55.188 --> 21:57.190
THERE'S A CHURCH
DOWN ON FAIRFAX,

21:57.274 --> 22:00.235
IN BETWEEN SANTA MONICA
AND SUNSET.

22:00.318 --> 22:01.528
I WOULD LEAVE
THE BEAR

22:01.611 --> 22:03.196
BETWEEN
THE PRAYER BOOKS,

22:03.280 --> 22:04.906
IN THE FIFTH PEW
FROM THE DOOR

22:04.990 --> 22:06.408
ON THE LEFT.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.952
THANK YOU, ANGELA.

22:11.163 --> 22:11.997
TAKE SANCHEZ

22:12.080 --> 22:13.081
AND CHECK OUT
THAT CHURCH.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.291
MAYBE ONE
OF THE PRIESTS,

22:14.374 --> 22:15.417
OR THE RECTOR,
OR THE POPE FOUND

22:15.500 --> 22:16.668
A TEDDY BEAR THERE
ONCE

22:16.752 --> 22:17.878
AND PUT IT IN
THE LOST AND FOUND.

22:17.961 --> 22:18.837
I'M ON IT.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.130
CHIEF.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.130
YES?

22:20.213 --> 22:23.592
ELAINE SAYS
ELAINE'S FOUND SOMETHING.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.387
THESE ARE THE SCRAPBOOKS

22:27.471 --> 22:28.597
SHE TOLD YOU WERE
UNIMPORTANT?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.223
THE PICTURES
OF RITA FARA TAKEN

22:30.307 --> 22:31.767
BEFORE MALIK WAS BORN...

22:31.850 --> 22:32.893
YOU RECOGNIZE
SOMEONE IN IT?

22:32.976 --> 22:34.811
NO, I RECOGNIZE
SOME PLACE.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.813
LOOK WHAT ELAINE
HAS FOUND.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.608
PROVENZA WOULD
LIKE TO LOOK, TOO.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.943
RITA FARA IS
NOT FROM BEIRUT.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.779
SHE'S NOT EVEN
FROM LEBANON.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.740
RITA FARA IS FROM AMMAN,
JORDAN.

22:55.832 --> 22:57.918
[SIGHS]

23:18.688 --> 23:21.483
AHH! OH, FOR GOODNESS' SAKE.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.193
[SIGHS]

23:32.828 --> 23:33.787
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

23:33.870 --> 23:35.122
HMM!

23:35.205 --> 23:38.834
YOU'RE BEING PAGED
AND YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING.

23:38.917 --> 23:39.793
ANDREW?

23:39.876 --> 23:41.002
HE'D LIKE AN UPDATE.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.255
OH. I CAN'T
GIVE HIM ONE.

23:43.338 --> 23:45.423
WHY?

23:45.507 --> 23:46.550
I'M HAVING
TRUST ISSUES.

23:46.633 --> 23:47.801
WITH ANDREW?

23:47.884 --> 23:49.052
WHO DIDN'T TELL ME
EVERYTHING

23:49.136 --> 23:50.178
WITH MALIK'S MOTHER
WHO LIED

23:50.262 --> 23:51.763
ABOUT
BEING FROM LEBANON

23:51.847 --> 23:53.014
WITH LARRY COLE,
ELAINE DONAHUE,

23:53.098 --> 23:54.474
WHO NEVER
TRUSTED EACH OTHER

23:54.558 --> 23:56.101
WITH RICHARD BRANCH,
WHO NEVER TRUSTED THEM.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.269
IN FACT, THE ONLY
PERSON GOING OUT

23:57.352 --> 23:58.311
OF THEIR WAY
TO BE HELPFUL

23:58.395 --> 23:59.813
MIGHT BE A TERRORIST.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.773
SO THIS TERRORIST GUY,

24:01.857 --> 24:03.733
ABDUL AL-FULANI--
HE WAS HELPFUL?

24:03.817 --> 24:05.277
WHICH MEANS THAT
HE'S CONFIDENT THAT

24:05.360 --> 24:06.820
ANYTHING I DISCOVER,
HE'S GOING TO FIND OUT

24:06.903 --> 24:08.405
ABOUT IT IN A HURRY,
WHICH MEANS...

24:08.488 --> 24:09.823
YOU'VE GOT TRUST ISSUES.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.408
SOME OF WHICH I'M
HOPING THAT RITA FARA

24:11.491 --> 24:12.868
WILL HELP ME SOLVE.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.327
I'VE SENT A BLACK AND
WHITE TO PICK HER UP.

24:14.411 --> 24:17.873
SO COULD YOU STALL
ANDREW FOR ME, PLEASE?

24:17.956 --> 24:20.125
BRENDA, HE'S FROM
WASHINGTON, D.C.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.209
AND IF THERE'S
ONE THING PEOPLE

24:21.293 --> 24:22.586
FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.

24:22.669 --> 24:24.880
TEND TO RECOGNIZE,
IT'S STALLING.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.381
I JUST--I KNOW
THERE'S SOMETHING

24:26.464 --> 24:28.717
IN THESE SCRAPBOOKS
THAT I'M MISSING.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.886
I MEAN, WHY WOULD
RITA FARA LIE TO ME

24:30.969 --> 24:32.304
ABOUT BEING FROM JORDAN?

24:32.387 --> 24:34.681
AND WHY WOULD SOMEONE
INSIDE THE ARMY OF ALLAH

24:34.764 --> 24:36.391
WANT MALIK TO GET
A U.S. PASSPORT

24:36.474 --> 24:37.976
OR TO GO TO WARSAW?

24:38.059 --> 24:40.228
I JUST--I NEED MORE
INFORMATION

24:40.312 --> 24:41.938
BEFORE I SPEAK
TO ANDREW AGAIN.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.982
I KNOW THAT
ANXIOUS, CRAZED LOOK,

24:44.065 --> 24:45.442
AND I KNOW THAT
THERE ARE VERY FEW WORDS

24:45.525 --> 24:48.236
I CAN SAY THAT WILL
ACTUALLY REGISTER RIGHT NOW,

24:48.320 --> 24:50.572
SO LET THEM BE THESE:

24:50.655 --> 24:53.408
I AM SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU
AND YOUR SQUAD BACK AT WORK

24:53.491 --> 24:56.286
THAT I AM WILLING
TO LIE TO THE PERSON

24:56.369 --> 24:59.623
WHO MADE IT ALL POSSIBLE
IF YOU REALLY NEED THE TIME.

24:59.706 --> 25:02.125
AND I DO.
THANK YOU, WILL.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.835
MM-HMM.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.835
OH.

25:05.503 --> 25:06.796
IF I DON'T GET
THIS RIGHT,

25:06.880 --> 25:08.256
YOU THINK THEY'LL
KICK ME OUT AGAIN?

25:08.340 --> 25:09.799
DON'T THINK LIKE THAT.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.426
SO THEY WILL.

25:14.512 --> 25:17.474
IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE VARIABLES.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.684
A COMPUTER
IS JUST A TOOL,

25:19.768 --> 25:21.311
AND A TOOL IS
ONLY AS GOOD

25:21.394 --> 25:23.772
AS THE PERSON
USING IT.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.273
BOOYA!

25:25.357 --> 25:26.483
CHIEF.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.318
IT'S AN ODD THING
TO REPORT, BUT--

25:28.401 --> 25:30.946
THERE WERE NO TEDDY
BEARS IN THE CHURCH.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.989
YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW
QUITE HOW TO SAY IT.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.742
OH, SHOOT.
THANK YOU.

25:35.825 --> 25:37.827
LIEUTENANT TAO,
HOW ARE WE DOING HERE?

25:37.911 --> 25:40.455
THE ABRIDGED
VERSION, PLEASE.

25:40.538 --> 25:42.290
WHEN LAST WE SAW
OUR HEROIC DATABASE,

25:42.374 --> 25:44.876
THERE WERE
14,762 POSSIBLES.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.253
SINCE THEN,
WITH THE ACCESS TO

25:46.336 --> 25:47.921
THE TERRORIST
INFORMATION NETWORK

25:48.004 --> 25:50.298
PROVIDED BY THE VERY,
VERY SPECIAL AGENT HOWARD,

25:50.382 --> 25:52.425
THE IDENTITY OF
MALIK'S FRIEND

25:52.509 --> 25:55.136
HAS BEEN NARROWED DOWN
TO 2,109.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.596
OH, THAT'S STILL
TOO MANY.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.098
WE'RE WAITING ON SOME
INFORMATION FROM CUSTOMS,

25:58.181 --> 26:00.642
CLASSIFIED STUFF
THAT EVEN AGENT HOWARD

26:00.725 --> 26:02.185
CAN'T ACCESS
WITHOUT APPROVAL.

26:02.269 --> 26:04.145
I'LL NEED FEWER NAMES
TO EVEN BEGIN

26:04.229 --> 26:05.605
TO INVESTIGATE
INDIVIDUALS. THANK YOU.

26:05.689 --> 26:06.648
CAN I HAVE A MOMENT?

26:06.731 --> 26:07.732
RIGHT NOW?
I NEED TO SPEAK

26:07.816 --> 26:08.733
TO RITA FARA.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.652
YEAH. RIGHT NOW.

26:10.735 --> 26:11.861
I'M LOOKING
AT SOME

26:11.945 --> 26:14.990
OF THE NAMES HERE,
AND, BRENDA...

26:15.073 --> 26:16.283
THESE GUYS ARE
REALLY DANGEROUS.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.492
AND YOU GET INTO THE CAR
WITH ONE OF THEM?

26:17.575 --> 26:19.035
NO, NOT ONE OF THEM,
3 OF THEM,

26:19.119 --> 26:20.662
BUT THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE
THEY WERE FOLLOWING ME.

26:20.745 --> 26:21.997
WHY ARE PEOPLE LIKE
THIS FOLLOWING YOU?

26:22.080 --> 26:23.248
WHERE DID THIS
DATABASE COME FROM?

26:23.331 --> 26:24.499
WHO GOT YOU
INVOLVED WITH THIS?

26:24.582 --> 26:25.542
ARE YOU REALLY
GOING AFTER

26:25.625 --> 26:26.710
TERRORISTS HERE?

26:26.793 --> 26:28.128
I WOULD ANSWER
ALL YOUR QUESTIONS,

26:28.211 --> 26:29.504
BUT I SIGNED
A CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT.

26:29.587 --> 26:30.964
YOU TRYING
TO REASSURE ME?

26:31.047 --> 26:32.132
'CAUSE YOU'RE DOING
A TERRIBLE JOB.

26:32.215 --> 26:33.341
CHIEF.

26:32.215 --> 26:33.341
HMM?

26:33.425 --> 26:34.676
JUST GOT WORD FROM
THE BLACK AND WHITE

26:34.759 --> 26:36.386
THAT WENT TO PICK UP
THAT FARA WOMAN.

26:36.469 --> 26:37.721
OH, TELL ME
SHE'S OK.

26:37.804 --> 26:39.306
WELL, I CAN'T.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.598
LOOKS LIKE SHE
PACKED UP AND LEFT.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.351
OHH, FOR
HEAVEN'S SAKE!

26:47.814 --> 26:48.857
I WANT
TO THANK YOU.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.358
HOW MUCH LONGER ARE
YOU GOING TO KEEP

26:50.442 --> 26:51.860
TREATING MY MOTHER
LIKE A CRIMINAL?

26:51.943 --> 26:53.028
AND AFTER SHE
HELPED YOU, TOO.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.279
CYNTHIA, I DON'T
NEED FOR YOU

26:54.362 --> 26:55.655
TO DEFEND ME.
THERE'S NO REASON

26:55.739 --> 26:57.240
FOR YOU TO BE HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

26:57.324 --> 26:59.034
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
Y'ALL CAN GO HOME.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.327
I'M GETTING NO WORD
TODAY.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.870
IF I NEED YOU AGAIN,
I WILL CALL YOU.

27:01.953 --> 27:03.997
AND THANK YOU, ELAINE.
YOU DID HELP, A LOT.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.790
WHAT? OH, ELAINE
HELPED YOU?

27:05.874 --> 27:07.208
HOW'D SHE HELP YOU?
I MEAN,

27:07.292 --> 27:08.460
SHE GET SOME SORT OF CHANCE
TO CLEAR HER NAME?

27:08.543 --> 27:09.711
MR. COLE, MY BEST
ADVICE TO YOU

27:09.794 --> 27:11.046
IS TO GO HOME
AND GET SOME REST.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.340
OH, YEAH? WHAT AM I
RESTING UP FOR, HUH?

27:16.301 --> 27:19.095
MS. JOHNSON,
ANDREW CALLED,

27:19.179 --> 27:22.057
AND HE--HE SERIOUSLY
WANTS TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

27:22.140 --> 27:25.018
GOOD. I'LL CALL HIM
WHEN I GET A CHANCE.

27:25.101 --> 27:27.562
ELAINE.

27:27.645 --> 27:28.688
MAY I...

27:28.772 --> 27:30.231
MAY I KNOW HOW
EVERYTHING TURNS OUT

27:30.315 --> 27:31.608
OR WILL YOU...

27:31.691 --> 27:33.610
ELAINE. THAT'S REALLY
NOT MY PLACE TO SAY.

27:33.693 --> 27:36.696
SHE HAS TO PROTECT
HER SOURCES...AND METHODS.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.490
CAN'T LET THE PEOPLE
KNOW HER SECRETS.

27:38.573 --> 27:41.451
CERTAINLY, IT'S A DRILL
YOU KNOW, MOTHER.

27:41.534 --> 27:42.911
CYNTHIA, WHY CAN'T
YOU EVER JUST

27:42.994 --> 27:44.496
WAIT IN THE CAR?

27:44.579 --> 27:46.873
SO IF YOU CALL,
YOU CALL.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.708
COME ON. I'M CRANKY,
I'M EXHAUSTED,

27:48.792 --> 27:50.710
AND I NEED TO SMOKE.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.881
GEOPOLITICS,
NATIONAL SECURITY,

27:54.964 --> 27:56.633
WAR AND PEACE...

27:57.926 --> 28:00.887
WHAT'S A DAUGHTER
COMPARED TO ALL THAT?

28:00.970 --> 28:03.765
YOU PEOPLE NEVER THINK
ABOUT THE FAMILIES AT ALL.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.360
SO, I WAS SO BUSY
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING,

28:15.443 --> 28:16.778
I DIDN'T NOTICE
WHAT WAS MISSING.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.405
SCRAPBOOKS, SCRAPBOOKS.
CAN I HAVE THE SCRAPBOOKS?

28:18.488 --> 28:19.906
OH, I GOT 'EM RIGHT HERE.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.116
THANK YOU.

28:24.702 --> 28:27.914
THE REAL STORY
IS NOT WHAT IS HERE

28:27.997 --> 28:29.416
BUT WHAT ISN'T.

28:29.499 --> 28:32.752
WHERE ARE THE PICTURES
OF RITA'S HUSBAND?

28:32.836 --> 28:33.795
SHE'S GOT ALL
THESE SCRAPBOOKS

28:33.878 --> 28:34.963
AND NO WEDDING PHOTOS.

28:35.046 --> 28:36.464
NOT ONE PICTURE
OF THE FATHER

28:36.548 --> 28:37.757
MALIK WORSHIPED.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.300
RITA WASN'T MARRIED.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.010
IT WOULD EXPLAIN
WHY SHE DIDN'T WANT

28:41.094 --> 28:42.345
HER SON TO GET
A PASSPORT,

28:42.429 --> 28:43.972
WHY SHE WAS ANXIOUS
ABOUT BEING SEEN

28:44.055 --> 28:45.473
WITH HER SON IN PUBLIC,

28:45.557 --> 28:49.811
WHY SHE DYES HER HAIR
AND WEARS COLORED CONTACTS.

28:49.894 --> 28:51.855
SHE WAS IN DISGUISE
MOST OF HER ADULT LIFE,

28:51.938 --> 28:53.731
HIDING FROM HER FAMILY.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.150
BECAUSE SHE HAD AN
ILLEGITIMATE BABY?

28:55.233 --> 28:56.484
IN JORDAN, IF A WOMAN
LOSES HER VIRGINITY

28:56.568 --> 28:57.944
BEFORE MARRIAGE,

28:58.027 --> 29:00.321
EVEN IF SHE'S RAPED,
ONE OF HER MALE RELATIVES

29:00.405 --> 29:01.865
KILLS HER TO PROTECT
THE FAMILY'S HONOR.

29:01.948 --> 29:03.283
YOU THINK THE GUY
IN THE CAR

29:03.366 --> 29:05.368
WAS MALIK'S FATHER?

29:05.452 --> 29:07.620
WHY ELSE WOULD SOMEONE
TRYING TO DEFECT

29:07.704 --> 29:09.581
REACH OUT TO US
THROUGH MALIK?

29:09.664 --> 29:11.166
MAKE CONDITIONS BASED
ON MALIK'S NEEDS.

29:11.249 --> 29:12.500
AND WHY HASN'T
MALIK'S FRIEND

29:12.584 --> 29:13.835
TRIED TO CONTACT US?

29:13.918 --> 29:15.879
BECAUSE HIS REASON
FOR DEFECTING IS DEAD.

29:15.962 --> 29:17.005
IT'S A GUESS,
LIEUTENANT FLYNN,

29:17.088 --> 29:18.131
BUT AN INFORMED ONE.

29:18.214 --> 29:19.174
LET'S SEE
WHAT IT GETS US.

29:19.257 --> 29:20.508
MALIK WAS 16 YEARS OLD.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.135
LET'S BE CONSERVATIVE
AND ADD ANOTHER

29:22.218 --> 29:23.511
19 YEARS TO THAT.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.846
SO KNOCK OFF
EVERYONE ON THIS LIST

29:24.929 --> 29:26.347
UNDER 35 YEARS OF AGE.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.391
AND THEN LET'S CROSS
OUR FINGERS

29:28.475 --> 29:30.018
AND ELIMINATE EVERYONE
WHO WASN'T LIVING

29:30.101 --> 29:33.062
IN JORDAN DURING THAT TIME.
HOW HARD IS THAT TO DO?

29:33.146 --> 29:34.814
WAIT A SEC.

29:34.898 --> 29:38.026
OOF. THAT AGE
THING BLEW OUT

29:38.109 --> 29:39.194
ALL BUT 246.

29:39.277 --> 29:44.449
NOW, JORDAN,
AND THE YEAR 1992.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.409
THAT'S GOING
TO BE BIG.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.746
WE'RE DOWN
TO 8 GUYS...

29:49.829 --> 29:53.708
AND ONE
OF THEM IS...

29:53.791 --> 29:54.876
OH.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.422
THIS GUY LOOK
FAMILIAR?

29:59.506 --> 30:00.632
ABDUL'S PHYSICIAN.

30:00.715 --> 30:03.009
DR. AL-THANI.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.720
YOU TRUST YOUR DOCTOR
WITH YOUR ILLNESS,

30:05.803 --> 30:06.888
WHY NOT YOUR SECRETS?

30:06.971 --> 30:08.264
OH, COME ON.
I MEAN, YOU THINK

30:08.348 --> 30:09.557
MALIK'S FATHER IS
GONNA SEE HIS SON

30:09.641 --> 30:10.975
GET SHOT, THEN RUN OFF
AND LEAVE?

30:11.059 --> 30:12.435
HE LEFT MALIK
WHEN HE WAS A BABY.

30:12.519 --> 30:13.603
WHY NOT DO IT AGAIN?

30:13.686 --> 30:14.979
THE TROUBLE IS,
IF I TRY TO FIND

30:15.063 --> 30:16.731
EVIDENCE THAT PROVES
THIS...

30:16.814 --> 30:18.775
WELL, YOU MIGHT
TIP OFF THE WRONG PEOPLE

30:18.858 --> 30:20.068
BEFORE YOU GET TO THIS GUY.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.361
EXACTLY WHAT
THEY'RE HOPING FOR.

30:21.444 --> 30:23.988
BUT IF DR. AL-THANI
IS THE GUY

30:24.072 --> 30:25.657
FROM THE CAR
WHO WAS THERE

30:25.740 --> 30:26.783
THE NIGHT MALIK
WAS KILLED,

30:26.866 --> 30:28.243
THEN HE KNOWS
SOMEONE ELSE

30:28.326 --> 30:29.911
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.
THIS IS OUR TWO-FER.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.037
AND ABDUL DID SAY
TO COME BY

30:31.120 --> 30:32.247
WHENEVER I WANTED.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.957
OH, HEY, HEY...
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA...

30:34.040 --> 30:35.750
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO THIS
NUT JOB TERRORIST'S HOUSE?

30:35.833 --> 30:36.793
COME ON. WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO

30:36.876 --> 30:38.127
WHEN YOU GET THERE?

30:38.211 --> 30:39.295
YOU'RE GONNA ASK
THIS DOCTOR IN FRONT

30:39.379 --> 30:40.421
OF AL-FULANI
IF HE WANTS TO

30:40.505 --> 30:41.714
DEFECT WITH YOU?

30:44.259 --> 30:45.969
NO.

30:47.470 --> 30:50.056
I'M GONNA HAVE
MALIK DO IT FOR ME.

30:57.397 --> 31:00.942
I'M UNUSED TO HOSTING WOMEN
TO WHOM I AM NOT RELATED.

31:01.025 --> 31:02.110
IS IT COURTEOUS
TO OFFER YOU

31:02.193 --> 31:03.111
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

31:03.194 --> 31:05.280
I WON'T BE LONG. I--

31:09.701 --> 31:12.829
JUST A TINY FOLLOW-UP
ON OUR EARLIER INTERVIEW,

31:12.912 --> 31:15.164
BECAUSE AFTER YOU
AND I SPOKE,

31:15.248 --> 31:18.459
RU'YAH FARA, MALIK'S
MOTHER, DISAPPEARED.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.212
WERE THERE SIGNS
OF A STRUGGLE?

31:21.296 --> 31:23.298
NO. THERE WERE SIGNS
OF RAPIDLY PACKED BAGS,

31:23.381 --> 31:25.133
AND SHE HAD NO REASON
TO BE AFRAID OF US.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.884
NOT OF ME,
I CAN ASSURE YOU.

31:26.968 --> 31:29.345
AS I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE,
I AM A SPIRITUAL MAN

31:29.429 --> 31:30.430
WHO DEVOTED HIS LIFE--

31:30.513 --> 31:33.349
I KNOW WHAT
YOU ARE, SIR.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.645
I BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE
INSIDE THE ARMY OF ALLAH

31:37.729 --> 31:39.814
WAS TRYIN' TO PASS SOME
PRETTY IMPORTANT SECRETS

31:39.897 --> 31:41.858
ALONG TO THE UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT.

31:41.941 --> 31:44.235
AMONG THOSE SECRETS WAS
INFORMATION CONCERNING

31:44.319 --> 31:46.154
20 POUNDS OF
SEPARATED PLUTONIUM

31:46.237 --> 31:48.448
AND THE NAME OF
THE C.I.A. OFFICER

31:48.531 --> 31:49.907
WHO HELPED YOU GET IT.

31:49.991 --> 31:52.577
[SPEAKING ARABIC]

31:52.660 --> 31:54.329
THESE ARE
THE LIES TOLD

31:54.412 --> 31:55.830
BY THAT INFIDEL BOY.

31:55.913 --> 31:57.332
I BELIEVE IT'S TRUE.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.167
BECAUSE YOU WISH
TO BE DECEIVED.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.127
NO.

32:01.210 --> 32:05.632
BECAUSE MALIK FARA
SPEAKS FROM THE DEAD.

32:05.715 --> 32:08.051
WELL, THAT IS ABSURD,
MISS JOHNSON.

32:08.134 --> 32:09.469
AND EVEN WERE IT NOT,

32:09.552 --> 32:11.804
WHAT IS THE WORD
OF A DEAD BOY WORTH

32:11.888 --> 32:12.972
IN A COURT OF LAW?

32:13.056 --> 32:15.350
WE'LL SEE.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.477
I NEED TO KNOW
WHERE THAT PLUTONIUM IS,

32:17.560 --> 32:19.687
AND I WANT TO MEET
THE C.I.A. OFFICER

32:19.771 --> 32:20.938
WHO HELPED YOU GET IT.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.607
AND I WANT YOU
TO ARRANGE THAT MEETING

32:22.690 --> 32:24.734
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, SIR.

32:29.364 --> 32:32.617
I'M AFRAID YOU AND I
HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY

32:32.700 --> 32:34.702
TO EACH OTHER, MISS JOHNSON.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.372
ALL RIGHT THEN, SIR.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.706
GOOD NIGHT.

32:46.381 --> 32:50.176
[DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES]

33:08.319 --> 33:10.279
Flynn: NO SIGN OF HIM
OVER HERE.

33:11.489 --> 33:14.367
Provenza: WHAT ABOUT
OVER THERE?

33:14.450 --> 33:15.618
NADA.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.037
DOCTOR IS ABOUT
AN HOUR LATE.

33:20.498 --> 33:21.374
YOU KNOW, CHIEF,

33:21.457 --> 33:22.709
THIS MAY NOT
BE THE GUY.

33:22.792 --> 33:25.211
HE'S THE GUY,
AND HE'LL SHOW.

33:25.294 --> 33:26.754
I LEFT EXPLICIT
INSTRUCTIONS

33:26.838 --> 33:28.214
INSIDE MALIK'S BEAR

33:28.297 --> 33:29.841
TELLIN' THE DOCTOR
EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED

33:29.924 --> 33:31.801
AND EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD
DO IF I DIDN'T GET IT.

33:31.884 --> 33:34.053
SO UNLESS HE WANTS
TO BE ARRESTED FOR MURDER

33:34.137 --> 33:35.805
TOMORROW MORNING,
HE'LL SHOW.

33:35.888 --> 33:37.098
EVERYONE BUT FLYNN,

33:37.181 --> 33:38.641
STAY AS STILL
AS POSSIBLE.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.770
TAR PITS IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE CITY.

33:42.854 --> 33:46.357
AND THEY SAY L.A.
HAS NO CENTER.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.484
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING'S
BOTHERING ME A LITTLE.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.153
WHAT'S THAT, SERGEANT?

33:50.236 --> 33:51.362
THIS WHOLE C.I.A. THING.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.448
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
I TRUST THEM.

33:53.531 --> 33:55.408
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT THE PEOPLE

33:55.491 --> 33:56.784
WHO WORK THERE, YOU KNOW?

33:56.868 --> 33:58.035
I KNOW.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.455
IT'S A...GRAY AREA.

34:00.538 --> 34:02.874
I REMEMBER ONCE
HEARING A SPEECH

34:02.957 --> 34:03.958
ABOUT WHAT IT MEANT
TO BE

34:04.041 --> 34:06.002
AN OFFICER
OF THE C.I.A.,

34:06.085 --> 34:08.004
AND THE MAN WHO
GAVE THIS SPEECH

34:08.087 --> 34:11.841
TALKED ABOUT THE STRUGGLE
TO CONTROL CIVILIZATION,

34:11.924 --> 34:14.427
AND HOW WE'RE ALWAYS
FIGHTING THE SAME FIGHT.

34:14.510 --> 34:17.472
AND HE USED THE DARK AGES
AS AN EXAMPLE.

34:17.555 --> 34:19.640
AND HE TALKED ABOUT
HOW, ON THE ONE SIDE,

34:19.724 --> 34:23.603
YOU HAD THE PRAGMATIC KING
WHO WAS GREEDY AND POWER-HUNGRY,

34:23.686 --> 34:25.146
AND BASICALLY TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE

34:25.229 --> 34:26.606
WHENEVER HE COULD.

34:26.689 --> 34:29.901
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE,
YOU HAD THE IDEALISTIC CHURCH

34:29.984 --> 34:32.528
FORCIN' EVERYONE
TO FOLLOW THE SAME RULES,

34:32.612 --> 34:34.822
BELIEVE THE SAME THINGS,
ALL THAT.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.741
NEITHER THE KING
NOR THE CHURCH

34:36.824 --> 34:38.493
WAS EVER COMPLETELY
RIGHT OR WRONG.

34:38.576 --> 34:42.246
BOTH SIDES ENDED UP
DOIN' TERRIBLE THINGS

34:42.330 --> 34:44.499
TO GET WHAT THEY WANTED.

34:44.582 --> 34:47.293
REALLY TERRIBLE THINGS.

34:47.376 --> 34:50.630
BUT THE POINT
OF THE STORY WAS THIS--

34:50.713 --> 34:53.341
THAT THIS STRUGGLE
FROM THE DARK AGES

34:53.424 --> 34:54.842
HAD BEEN GOIN' ON FOREVER.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.677
AND THE CHURCH
AND THE KING

34:56.761 --> 34:58.513
MIGHT TAKE ON DIFFERENT
FORMS AND PHILOSOPHIES,

34:58.596 --> 35:01.682
BUT THAT THEY WOULD
ALWAYS FIGHT EACH OTHER.

35:01.766 --> 35:04.185
PRAGMATISTS
AND IDEALISTS.

35:04.268 --> 35:06.187
AND THEN MOST TIMES,

35:06.270 --> 35:07.647
YOU'RE BETTER OFF
STANDIN' ON THE SIDELINES

35:07.730 --> 35:10.566
AND LETTIN' THEM
DUKE IT OUT.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.819
BUT EVERY
ONCE IN A WHILE,

35:12.902 --> 35:14.779
ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER

35:14.862 --> 35:16.280
DECIDES IT MIGHT
BE BETTER TO JUST

35:16.364 --> 35:20.368
BLOW UP THE WHOLE WORLD,
JUST GET ITS OWN WAY.

35:20.451 --> 35:22.370
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS,

35:22.453 --> 35:25.790
YOU CAN'T STAND
ON THE SIDELINES ANYMORE.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.125
YOU HAVE TO PICK A TEAM.

35:31.879 --> 35:34.257
AND SO, FOR TONIGHT,
ANYWAY,

35:34.340 --> 35:35.925
WE'RE SERVIN' THE KING.

35:36.008 --> 35:37.760
Gabriel: CHIEF,
SOMEBODY'S COMIN'.

35:37.844 --> 35:40.221
ALL RIGHT, SERGEANT.
NO ONE MOVES

35:40.304 --> 35:41.889
UNTIL BOTH PARTIES
COME TOGETHER.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.475
UH, HERE COMES
THE DOCTOR, CHIEF,

35:44.559 --> 35:47.603
AND HE'S HEADING
RIGHT FOR THE BRIDGE.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.064
KEEP MOVIN'.
DON'T LOOK AT HIM.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.402
HEY, CHIEF, THERE'S
SOMEBODY ELSE HERE.

35:54.485 --> 35:57.321
HOLD STILL, EVERYONE.
LET THEM GET TOGETHER.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.087
HELLO, DOCTOR.

36:13.170 --> 36:15.423
I GATHER WE'RE
IN TROUBLE SOMEHOW.

36:15.506 --> 36:16.632
YES, UH, WE ARE.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.593
WE ALL MUST
LEAVE TONIGHT.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.847
PERSONALLY, I THINK
WE STAYED TOO LONG ALREADY,

36:22.930 --> 36:25.641
ESPECIALLY WITH VOITSKI
GETTING PINNED IN THE HEAD.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.351
WHAT ABOUT
OUR FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS?

36:27.435 --> 36:30.605
YES, WE HAVE TRANSFERRED
THE LAST $10 MILLION

36:30.688 --> 36:32.315
TO YOUR SWISS
BANK ACCOUNT.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.108
TIME TO ENJOY
THAT LITTLE VILLA

36:34.192 --> 36:35.484
ON THE MEDITERRANEAN, YES?

36:35.568 --> 36:37.570
YES. WE SHOULD MOVE
TO THE EXIT.

36:37.653 --> 36:39.322
I HAVE TRANSPORTATION
FOR YOU.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.201
THEY'RE MOVING OUT, CHIEF.

36:43.284 --> 36:44.577
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
GO FOR IT.

36:44.660 --> 36:45.828
BUT BE CAREFUL.
ONE OF THEM

36:45.912 --> 36:47.079
MIGHT BE ARMED.

36:55.338 --> 36:58.049
WE MUST HURRY. COME.

36:58.799 --> 36:59.926
DAMN IT.

36:58.799 --> 36:59.926
GO.

37:00.009 --> 37:01.469
YOU LED ME INTO
A TRAP, YOU--

37:01.552 --> 37:04.347
HE-HE HAS A GUN!
HE-HE HAS A GUN!

37:04.430 --> 37:06.641
HE HAS A GUN!

37:06.724 --> 37:07.892
[GUNSHOT]

37:09.435 --> 37:11.437
WHAT WAS THAT SHOT?!

37:11.520 --> 37:12.688
DON'T MOVE!

37:12.772 --> 37:13.689

WHAT WAS THAT SHOT?!

37:13.773 --> 37:15.316
DON'T MOVE.
YOU MOVE,

37:15.399 --> 37:16.317
IT'LL BE
THE LAST THING YOU DO,

37:16.400 --> 37:17.318
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!

37:17.401 --> 37:18.611
WHO'S HURT?!

37:20.363 --> 37:21.322
IS ANYONE HURT?

37:21.405 --> 37:22.698
PAT DOWN THE DOCTOR.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.408
WE DON'T WANT ANY
SURPRISES IN THE VAN.

37:26.035 --> 37:27.203
LET'S GO.

37:32.124 --> 37:33.167
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

37:33.250 --> 37:34.835
SPY BOY HERE TOOK
A SHOT AT ME.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.337

SERGEANT GABRIEL?

37:38.506 --> 37:39.840
NOBODY'S HIT,
NOBODY'S HIT.

37:39.924 --> 37:41.217
WE GOT HIM.
IT'S RICHARD BRANCH.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.177
WE GOT HIM.

37:43.260 --> 37:44.387
AH.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.810
ALL RIGHT.

37:50.893 --> 37:52.436
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

37:52.520 --> 37:56.357
ESCORT THE VAN BACK HERE.
TURN OFF THE HEADPIECES.

37:56.440 --> 38:00.111
AND, UM, BUZZ, GIVE
THE DOCTOR YOUR HEADPHONES.

38:05.491 --> 38:06.867
DON'T BOTHER ARRESTING ME.

38:06.951 --> 38:09.286
DON'T BOTHER
READING ME MY RIGHTS.

38:09.370 --> 38:10.955
MY KNOWLEDGE
OF THE ARMY OF ALLAH

38:11.038 --> 38:13.499
IS EXTENSIVE,
AND THE AGENCY WOULD RATHER

38:13.582 --> 38:15.543
I SHARE IT
THAN GO TO JAIL.

38:15.626 --> 38:17.378
WHY NOT DO BOTH?

38:18.212 --> 38:19.547
WE SHOULD MEET.

38:19.630 --> 38:22.258
I'M SPECIAL AGENT
FRITZ HOWARD OF THE F.B.I.

38:22.341 --> 38:23.676
YOU'RE NOT GOING BACK
TO THE AGENCY.

38:23.759 --> 38:26.929
SO JUST SHUT UP
AND SIT VERY STILL.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.682
Brenda: DR. AL-THANI,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

38:29.765 --> 38:33.060
YES. IS...IS...

38:33.144 --> 38:35.104
IS MALIK STILL ALIVE?

38:35.187 --> 38:38.232
NO, SIR. HE'S NOT.

38:38.315 --> 38:39.984
I'M SORRY. I TRIED
NOT TO MISLEAD YOU

38:40.067 --> 38:41.027
ON THAT POINT.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.319
AND I HATE TO
ARREST YOU,

38:42.403 --> 38:43.612
BUT WE DON'T
HAVE MUCH TIME.

38:43.696 --> 38:45.031
HOW MUCH LONGER
BEFORE YOUR ABSENCE

38:45.114 --> 38:47.241
WILL BE NOTICED
AT THE AL-FULANI HOUSE?

38:47.324 --> 38:50.077
UH, 2 HOURS AT THE MOST.
I--I MUST GO BACK.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.912
NO, YOU CAN'T
GO BACK, DOCTOR.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.330
YOU CAN'T KEEP ME HERE!

38:53.414 --> 38:54.749
DOCTOR, WE'VE GOT
AN AWFULLY GOOD SET

38:54.832 --> 38:56.542
OF PRINTS
FROM THAT ICE PICK

38:56.625 --> 38:58.586
THAT YOU SHOVED
IN VOITSKI'S EAR.

38:58.669 --> 39:00.463
SO IF YOU DON'T
HELP US,

39:00.546 --> 39:01.797
I'M GOING TO
ARREST YOU FOR MURDER.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.257
VOITSKI MURDERED MY SON!

39:03.340 --> 39:04.383
YOU KILLED YOUR SON

39:04.467 --> 39:05.760
WHEN YOU RAN OFF
AND LEFT HIM.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.845
YOU ACTUALLY
SEWED VOITSKI'S LEG UP

39:07.928 --> 39:09.263
AFTER HE MURDERED
YOUR SON!

39:09.346 --> 39:11.432
I HAD TO!
THERE WERE PEOPLE THERE.

39:11.515 --> 39:13.059
WHY--WHY DID THEY DO THIS?

39:13.142 --> 39:15.770
THERE WAS NO REASON
TO KILL MALIK!

39:15.853 --> 39:17.938
THEY MADE A MISTAKE.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.441
BUT YOU CAN MAKE THEM
PAY FOR IT.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.817
OR YOU CAN SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

39:21.901 --> 39:23.444
IN AN AMERICAN PRISON.

39:23.527 --> 39:25.446
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

39:26.822 --> 39:28.699
ARE YOU STILL WITH ME?

39:28.783 --> 39:31.827
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

39:31.911 --> 39:34.413
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE SEPARATED PLUTONIUM IS?

39:35.706 --> 39:38.209
YES, YES.

39:38.292 --> 39:39.460
IT'S IN HAMBURG.

39:39.543 --> 39:41.378
Brenda: IS IT WHERE
WE CAN GET TO IT?

39:41.462 --> 39:43.464
YES, I CAN GIVE YOU
THE ADDRESS.

39:43.547 --> 39:45.049
WELL, THEN
SPEAK FAST, DOCTOR.

39:45.132 --> 39:47.468
BECAUSE THE SECOND
PEOPLE KNOW YOU'RE GONE,

39:47.551 --> 39:49.887
WE LOSE EVERYTHING.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.946
GERMAN AUTHORITIES CALLED.
THEY FOUND THE PACKAGE.

40:07.029 --> 40:08.948
OH, THAT'S
A RELIEF ANYHOW.

40:09.031 --> 40:10.950
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW
YOU HAVEN'T EXACTLY

40:11.033 --> 40:12.785
PLAYED THIS
BY ANDREW'S RULES.

40:12.868 --> 40:14.662
OH, I THINK
I GOT IT COVERED.

40:14.745 --> 40:15.871
THANKS.

40:14.745 --> 40:15.871
MM-HMM.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.665
GOOD WORK, EVERYBODY.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.168
GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK,
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.

40:21.252 --> 40:22.336
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA.

40:22.419 --> 40:24.505
THANK YOU,
CHIEF POPE, SIR.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.882
[IMITATING SANCHEZ]
THANK YOU, CHIEF POPE, SIR.

40:33.806 --> 40:35.850
GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK,
SANCHEZ.

40:38.936 --> 40:41.021
[LAUGHTER]

40:43.858 --> 40:46.026
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]

40:51.615 --> 40:52.783
DOCTOR.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.454
I...

40:58.747 --> 41:02.960
I HEARD MY SON PLAYING
IN THE BACK OF AN AUDITORIUM.

41:03.043 --> 41:07.381
AFTER HIS MOTHER LEFT,
I WENT TO MEET HIM...

41:07.464 --> 41:10.968
BECAUSE IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
WHAT HE COULD DO.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.557
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP HIM.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.309
DID YOU EVER
IDENTIFY YOURSELF

41:18.392 --> 41:19.894
TO HIM AS HIS FATHER?

41:19.977 --> 41:21.312
DID YOU EVER
TELL MALIK

41:21.395 --> 41:22.855
WHY YOU WERE
TRYING TO HELP HIM?

41:22.938 --> 41:26.066
THAT'S ENOUGH.
UH, THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.907
BRENDA?

41:31.614 --> 41:32.907
YEAH?

41:32.990 --> 41:34.241
YOU WENT BACK
ON OUR DEAL.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.452
I DID EXACTLY
WHAT YOU ASKED.

41:36.535 --> 41:38.996
THE GERMANS HAVE
THE SEPARATED PLUTONIUM,

41:39.079 --> 41:40.706
AND THE F.B.I.
HAS RICHARD.

41:40.789 --> 41:42.041
AND YOU HAVE
DR. AL-THANI.

41:42.124 --> 41:43.834
AND I'M TOLD
THAT RICHARD BRANCH

41:43.918 --> 41:45.044
WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE
TO YOUR DEBRIEFERS

41:45.127 --> 41:46.420
WHENEVER YOU WANT HIM.

41:46.503 --> 41:48.589
YOUR JOB WAS GIVEN BACK
TO YOU ON THE CONDITION--

41:48.672 --> 41:52.384
ANDREW, WHILE I APPRECIATE
THE AGENCY'S ASSISTANCE,

41:52.468 --> 41:53.886
SINCE I'VE GIVEN
THE F.B.I. FULL CREDIT

41:53.969 --> 41:56.305
ON A MAJOR
ESPIONAGE ARREST,

41:56.388 --> 41:58.265
THEY'RE MY NEW
BEST FRIENDS.

41:58.349 --> 42:01.268
AND I HAVE GIVEN YOU
A MURDERER.

42:01.352 --> 42:03.145
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA

42:03.229 --> 42:04.939
HOW HARD THAT IS
FOR ME TO DO.

42:05.022 --> 42:07.816
Pope: LOOK, I THINK I GET
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

42:07.900 --> 42:09.026
THE C.I.A.
IS EMBARRASSED

42:09.109 --> 42:10.945
ABOUT AN INTELLIGENCE
FAILURE...

42:11.028 --> 42:13.489
AGAIN. THEY'RE USED TO IT.

42:13.572 --> 42:16.200
BRENDA DID HER JOB.
YOU DID YOURS.

42:16.283 --> 42:18.494
CAN'T THIS JUST BE OVER?

42:20.120 --> 42:21.872
YES, WELL, I'VE EXPRESSED

42:21.956 --> 42:25.209
THE COMPANY'S
OFFICIAL IRRITATION.

42:25.292 --> 42:29.338
HMM. IT WAS NICE
SEEING YOU AGAIN, BRENDA.

42:29.421 --> 42:33.342
I WISH YOU WELL.
I DO...WISH YOU WELL.

42:33.425 --> 42:35.511
YOU, TOO, SIR.

42:38.222 --> 42:40.391
OH, AND IF ANYONE
ASKS YOU,

42:40.474 --> 42:41.850
I WAS AS MAD
AS A HORNET.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.230
THANK YOU, SIR.

42:46.313 --> 42:48.941
DID I HEAR THE WORDS
"GOOD JOB" IN THERE ANYWHERE?

42:49.024 --> 42:51.110
YEAH, BUT IT WAS
IN CODE.

42:51.193 --> 42:52.319
[CHUCKLES]

43:11.588 --> 43:12.339
[NAIL FALLS ON FLOOR]

43:12.423 --> 43:13.590
OHH.

43:22.599 --> 43:25.394
I LIKE IT RIGHT THERE.

43:25.477 --> 43:26.979
YOUR PICTURE.

43:27.062 --> 43:28.355
JIM PROVENZA!

43:28.439 --> 43:30.524
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?
IT'S LATE!

43:30.607 --> 43:31.775
WHY AREN'T YOU HOME?

43:31.859 --> 43:33.027
'COURSE, IDEALLY,
YOU WOULD--

43:33.110 --> 43:35.029
YOU KNOW, YOU'D
HANG IT UP RIGHT NOW

43:35.112 --> 43:36.530
AND PUT IT BACK
WHERE IT BELONGS,

43:36.614 --> 43:38.198
OR PRAGMATICALLY,
YOU MIGHT JUST

43:38.282 --> 43:39.408
SET IT DOWN
ON THE FLOOR.

43:39.491 --> 43:41.201
BUT YOU SEE,
YOUR INSTINCT IS

43:41.285 --> 43:42.870
TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE

43:42.953 --> 43:45.873
SO THAT EVEN IF IT'S
NOT PERFECTLY PLACED,

43:45.956 --> 43:48.000
YOU CAN STILL SEE IT.

43:48.083 --> 43:49.877
AREN'T YOU TIRED?

43:49.960 --> 43:51.837
YEAH. YEAH.

43:51.920 --> 43:53.255
BUT I HADN'T BEEN HERE
IN A WHILE,

43:53.339 --> 43:57.051
AND, I DON'T KNOW,
I KINDA MISSED THE PLACE.

43:57.134 --> 43:58.218
PLUS, BEFORE
HE LEFT TONIGHT,

43:58.302 --> 43:59.303
FLYNN PILED UP MY DESK

43:59.386 --> 44:00.929
WITH EVERY COFFEE CUP
IN THE JOINT,

44:01.013 --> 44:02.056
OLD CASE FILES.

44:02.139 --> 44:03.265
I THINK HE EVEN BROUGHT
A LITTLE TRASH

44:03.349 --> 44:06.226
FROM HIS HOUSE.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.729
SO I JUST THOUGHT
THAT BEFORE I CLEANED IT UP,

44:08.812 --> 44:11.940
I MIGHT, UH...

44:12.024 --> 44:13.776
TAKE YOU OUT TO BREAKFAST.

44:13.859 --> 44:15.986
YOU KNOW SOME PLACE
FAST AND CHEAP?

44:16.070 --> 44:18.280
FAST AND CHEAP
IS MY SPECIALTY.

44:18.364 --> 44:19.698
SO COME ON.

44:19.782 --> 44:21.492
LET'S GRAB A BITE TO EAT,
AND THEN WHEN WE GET BACK,

44:21.575 --> 44:24.536
I'LL HANG YOUR PICTURE UP
SO YOU DON'T GO NUTS.

44:24.620 --> 44:27.373
WELL, HOW CAN I REFUSE
AN INVITATION LIKE THAT?

44:28.207 --> 44:29.792
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND.
