WEBVTT

00:05.113 --> 00:07.062
[sirens]

00:08.523 --> 00:11.097
Tickets this way for the Chatsworth Express.

00:11.202 --> 00:15.064
Come and watch pikeys making a mess of the lives

00:15.168 --> 00:18.891
they were given by Him upstairs.

00:18.996 --> 00:23.379
And kids they're convinced aren't actually theirs.

00:23.483 --> 00:28.354
What sounds on Earth could ever replace kids needing money,

00:28.458 --> 00:29.780
or wives in your face?

00:29.885 --> 00:32.773
Cause this, people reckon, and me included,

00:32.877 --> 00:37.052
is why pubs and drugs were kindly invented.

00:37.156 --> 00:42.271
To calm us all down, stop us going mental.

00:42.375 --> 00:46.098
These are Chatsworth Estates' basic essentials.

00:46.202 --> 00:50.238
We are worth every penny for grinding your axes.

00:50.343 --> 00:54.518
You shit on our heads, but you pay the taxes.

00:58.971 --> 01:02.833
Imagine a Britain without Chatsworth buccaneers

01:02.937 --> 01:06.277
who'll come on your face for the price of a beer.

01:06.382 --> 01:07.774
Make poverty history.

01:07.878 --> 01:10.208
Cheaper drugs now!

01:10.314 --> 01:12.992
Make poverty history.

01:13.097 --> 01:16.610
Cheaper drugs now!

01:16.715 --> 01:17.724
Scatter!

01:17.828 --> 01:18.664
Party!

01:27.222 --> 01:29.971
DEBBIE (VOICEOVER): Age of enlightenment, age of reason,

01:30.075 --> 01:31.606
age of Aquarius--

01:31.710 --> 01:34.076
it's always the age of something.

01:34.180 --> 01:36.824
We live in the information age.

01:36.929 --> 01:39.851
Internet, satellite, cable.

01:39.956 --> 01:41.661
Oh!

01:41.765 --> 01:44.479
Are you sure that's your most respectable gear?

01:44.583 --> 01:46.044
Me black tights are laddered.

01:46.148 --> 01:48.897
Had to raid the laundry basket for these.

01:49.001 --> 01:50.915
Looks like she got a bit of--

01:51.020 --> 01:52.619
Fuck me stockings.

01:52.724 --> 01:54.081
And a bare tit on display has always

01:54.186 --> 01:57.769
been just my luck at a funeral.

01:57.874 --> 02:00.587
DEBBIE (VOICEOVER): Quality information is at a premium,

02:00.691 --> 02:03.267
and those who have it want to hold onto it.

02:03.371 --> 02:06.328
Because information is dangerous.

02:06.432 --> 02:07.546
Hey!

02:07.650 --> 02:10.120
You told me St. Martin's.

02:10.225 --> 02:11.129
Oh, did I?

02:11.234 --> 02:13.390
Oh, I meant St. Mark's.

02:13.494 --> 02:14.956
You don't sit down.

02:15.061 --> 02:18.088
Well, you'll only get pissed and embarrass us.

02:18.192 --> 02:20.975
Who the fuck are you to censor where I go and don't go?

02:21.079 --> 02:23.098
Any chance you might be slightly overreacting, Mr. G?

02:23.202 --> 02:24.767
You straighten your gusset there and listen

02:24.871 --> 02:26.159
to what you've got to say.

02:26.263 --> 02:27.829
I am the head of the house. I should be told.

02:27.934 --> 02:29.116
- Told what? - Everything!

02:29.221 --> 02:30.856
Where, who, why.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.700
When. Where.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.518
My role is to listen, advise, support.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.492
People look to me.

02:36.597 --> 02:37.989
Only to point and laugh.

02:38.093 --> 02:39.728
You've only bothered cause the chance of a free drink

02:39.832 --> 02:40.946
flashed in front of your eyes.

02:41.050 --> 02:43.242
To pay my respects.

02:43.346 --> 02:47.695
I knew Theresa before you were even a teardrop in me trousers.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.965
And as for the free drink, well-- you know, every cloud.

02:55.941 --> 02:57.159
You all right?

02:57.263 --> 02:59.037
Fucking indigestion.

02:59.141 --> 03:01.647
That fucking curry that Yvonne gave us last night.

03:01.751 --> 03:03.664
I had it on me chips.

03:03.769 --> 03:05.474
Yvonne didn't do a curry last night.

03:05.578 --> 03:08.396
Then what was that green stuff on the stove, then?

03:19.182 --> 03:20.016
Can't think.

03:52.095 --> 03:55.261
My patience has been sorely fucking tested.

03:55.365 --> 03:56.200
Good.

03:59.957 --> 04:01.697
Morning.

04:01.802 --> 04:03.959
Oh my god.

04:04.063 --> 04:05.420
You weren't?

04:05.524 --> 04:08.064
Don't be ridiculous.

04:08.169 --> 04:10.047
Did you get your undies from the washing basket?

04:10.152 --> 04:11.056
Yes.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.274
There's caustic soda in the crotch.

04:21.005 --> 04:22.607
Piss off.

04:22.711 --> 04:24.382
We open in five.

04:24.486 --> 04:25.599
I need to get away, anyway.

04:33.914 --> 04:34.749
Morning.

04:34.854 --> 04:35.723
Yeah.

04:40.629 --> 04:43.934
We should at least try and be civil to one another.

04:44.039 --> 04:45.291
I haven't kicked you out, have I?

04:50.231 --> 04:51.241
You look nice.

04:54.476 --> 04:55.346
Hey, beautiful.

04:55.450 --> 04:56.946
All set?

04:57.051 --> 04:57.920
Yeah!

04:58.025 --> 04:58.930
Yeah!

04:59.034 --> 04:59.869
Wee!

05:07.837 --> 05:11.072
I still don't see how come I can't go to this funeral.

05:11.176 --> 05:12.985
Don't want to spoil your innocence by finding out

05:13.090 --> 05:15.490
you're gonna be worm food one day.

05:15.595 --> 05:19.526
Besides, I need your help packing all this.

05:19.631 --> 05:21.614
14 quid some sow's willing to pay for that.

05:21.718 --> 05:23.457
Whole set's worth a couple of hundred.

05:23.562 --> 05:25.685
One geek selling crap to another geek.

05:25.789 --> 05:28.329
Not exactly what the internet was invented for.

05:28.433 --> 05:29.303
You calling me a geek?

05:29.407 --> 05:30.485
You looked in the mirror lately?

05:32.747 --> 05:34.696
What are you gonna do with all the money?

05:34.800 --> 05:36.156
Add it to the pot.

05:36.261 --> 05:38.210
Whatever I get for the owls will set me up.

05:46.734 --> 05:48.717
We've been over this, wee man.

05:48.821 --> 05:51.396
There's nothing for me on the Chatsworth.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.726
I was having a riot and a beef. It's all done.

05:53.830 --> 05:55.118
It-- happened.

06:01.833 --> 06:04.442
On behalf of all Theresa's family,

06:04.546 --> 06:07.295
I'd like to thank you all for coming.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.287
And drink your fill in her blessed memory.

06:10.392 --> 06:11.818
- Theresa. - Theresa.

06:15.228 --> 06:15.959
Grub's good.

06:16.063 --> 06:17.489
I've not eaten since breakfast.

06:17.594 --> 06:18.463
Salad's not bad, either.

06:21.246 --> 06:24.309
You're mooching at a funeral?

06:24.413 --> 06:26.326
Where's all that go?

06:26.431 --> 06:28.310
I've got Johnny Vegas locked in me attic.

06:40.799 --> 06:42.227
Must be fate.

06:42.331 --> 06:44.209
I asked around my mates, but nobody knew who you were.

06:44.314 --> 06:45.705
Thought I'd lost yet.

06:45.809 --> 06:46.715
And yet here I am.

06:53.673 --> 06:55.621
Is it my turn to say something?

06:55.726 --> 06:56.978
Or do you want me to fuck off?

07:01.119 --> 07:01.814
So--

07:01.918 --> 07:02.928
She was my grandmother.

07:03.032 --> 07:04.040
On my dad's side.

07:08.633 --> 07:10.025
He shoots, he scores.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.808
Should come around for a drink later.

07:12.913 --> 07:14.373
It's weird, though.

07:14.478 --> 07:15.835
I keep getting the feeling that I know him from somewhere.

07:15.940 --> 07:16.913
You do.

07:17.018 --> 07:19.210
He shagged her about three months ago.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.636
After ABBA night at the Jockey.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.619
Well, she didn't say aught.

07:22.723 --> 07:26.377
Maybe she don't remember.

07:26.481 --> 07:28.603
Nice of you to bring the family, Frank.

07:28.708 --> 07:31.943
Her kids will appreciate that.

07:32.048 --> 07:33.718
Dragged them out of bed, Algie.

07:33.822 --> 07:34.936
Least I could do.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.127
Theresa was one of a kind.

07:37.232 --> 07:38.798
I didn't know you were so close.

07:38.902 --> 07:39.772
Aye.

07:43.007 --> 07:47.217
When I was 15, Theresa would be--

07:47.322 --> 07:50.453
oh, pushing about 40.

07:50.558 --> 07:54.976
But she's still fit, you know?

07:55.080 --> 08:00.995
Blessed like Hindenburgs-- points in the sky was--

08:01.099 --> 08:03.465
lush, heart shaped ass.

08:03.570 --> 08:06.527
She rode me raw, Algie.

08:06.631 --> 08:11.745
She initiated me in the pearls of the flesh.

08:11.850 --> 08:13.763
It was a two way street, though.

08:13.867 --> 08:18.008
Old Tommy-- he wasn't, you know, adult fit.

08:18.112 --> 08:19.713
[microphone feedback]

08:21.139 --> 08:22.253
Sorry, Algie, is that me?

08:22.357 --> 08:23.575
It's the curry last night.

08:33.385 --> 08:34.917
Testing, one, two.

08:35.020 --> 08:36.726
Who the fuck is that idiot?

08:46.015 --> 08:47.199
How could she not remember?

08:47.303 --> 08:48.521
You didn't remember her.

08:51.895 --> 08:53.217
Oh, come on!

08:53.321 --> 08:54.956
MAN: Fuck off!

08:55.061 --> 08:59.549
I'm in dire fucking straits here!

08:59.654 --> 09:02.124
I know this might be a bad ass above tit,

09:02.228 --> 09:04.281
seeing as we've already spent the night together,

09:04.386 --> 09:09.569
but maybe I could take you for a drink sometime?

09:09.673 --> 09:11.483
Are you asking me out at your gran's funeral?

09:11.588 --> 09:14.336
By all accounts, Gram was a bit of a goer.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.075
I'm sure she'd approve.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.085
[farting]

09:18.197 --> 09:19.102
[sigh]

09:20.667 --> 09:22.164
[plopping]

09:25.329 --> 09:27.835
[groaning]

09:35.594 --> 09:38.203
Well, I can hardly stop now!

09:38.307 --> 09:39.212
Ah!

09:39.316 --> 09:41.404
[farting] Ah!

09:50.658 --> 09:53.511
You're a puff.

09:53.616 --> 09:56.399
Your ringtone is Copacabana.

09:56.503 --> 09:58.729
And you pluck your eyebrows.

09:58.835 --> 10:01.548
Yeah, that's-- that's just personal grooming.

10:01.652 --> 10:03.288
You saw "The Sound of Music" three times

10:03.392 --> 10:04.575
when it was in Manchester.

10:04.679 --> 10:08.159
Yeah, that's-- it's a morality tale.

10:13.899 --> 10:15.187
Did Carl tell you?

10:15.291 --> 10:18.248
I used my own amazing powers of deduction.

10:21.519 --> 10:25.137
You know that Ian is also a homosexual?

10:25.241 --> 10:27.259
Oh, I've seen his membership card.

10:27.363 --> 10:30.356
Got a proposition for ya.

10:30.460 --> 10:31.782
Hey!

10:31.887 --> 10:35.122
Do you think I've gone too far?

10:35.226 --> 10:35.992
The eyebrows?

10:36.096 --> 10:37.905
Some might say not far enough.

10:44.063 --> 10:46.569
I've never seen you cook once since I met ya.

10:46.673 --> 10:48.238
I can follow a recipe, thank you.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.526
I'm not a complete idiot.

10:49.630 --> 10:51.300
Look, get 'em set around a table.

10:51.405 --> 10:54.362
We'll have to talk.

10:54.466 --> 10:55.858
What are you doing?

10:55.963 --> 10:58.780
Loss adjuster from the insurance comes tomorrow.

10:58.884 --> 11:00.659
All me invoices have been rendered

11:00.763 --> 11:02.816
unreadable due to water damage.

11:02.921 --> 11:03.965
So I have to estimate.

11:04.069 --> 11:04.938
We don't sell electrical goods.

11:05.043 --> 11:07.130
Of course we do, Stanley.

11:07.234 --> 11:10.992
All my stock has been tragically decimated in this fire.

11:11.097 --> 11:13.114
There's is skip down on River and Common.

11:13.220 --> 11:14.472
Go see what you can find.

11:14.576 --> 11:17.325
Every piece of crap I drag in, I get a tenner.

11:17.429 --> 11:18.473
What are you doing?

11:21.291 --> 11:23.726
I need 30 quid.

11:23.830 --> 11:25.361
Is that a problem?

11:28.840 --> 11:31.798
I'm scrounging through skips doing this to my nails,

11:31.902 --> 11:33.434
and he can take what he wants?

11:33.538 --> 11:34.929
What do you want doing with these?

11:35.033 --> 11:36.251
Kick the fuck out of 'em.

11:36.355 --> 11:37.991
Mark 'em as reduced, put 'em with fire stock.

11:52.081 --> 11:54.482
What was Debbie's quote?

11:54.586 --> 11:57.404
The single most humiliating day of my life.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.353
And that's saying something, Frank.

11:59.457 --> 12:01.197
Well, I've had a Dicky Tommy, see?

12:01.301 --> 12:02.345
And--

12:08.260 --> 12:11.286
Even when you genuinely try to do right, you still fuck it up,

12:11.391 --> 12:12.644
don't you?

12:12.748 --> 12:14.279
I'm cursed.

12:14.383 --> 12:17.758
Like I was Glenn Hoddle in a previous life, or something.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.810
Just listen sometimes.

12:19.914 --> 12:21.168
I do!

12:21.272 --> 12:22.629
I'm not talking about the gaps in between what

12:22.733 --> 12:23.811
you want to say.

12:23.916 --> 12:27.048
I mean really listen.

12:27.152 --> 12:28.508
It's an under-valued skill.

12:34.771 --> 12:36.023
Best go in.

12:36.128 --> 12:38.355
Endure the wrath of Debbie.

12:38.459 --> 12:39.641
Well, she's not there.

12:39.746 --> 12:41.103
She's down the Jockey.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.704
Yvonne's got the little one.

12:49.418 --> 12:51.610
Despite your reasonable tone and helpful advice,

12:51.715 --> 12:52.932
I still fucking hate ya.

12:53.036 --> 12:53.871
Of course.

13:03.752 --> 13:07.301
How do you like it?

13:07.406 --> 13:09.667
Four hours, that took.

13:09.772 --> 13:11.337
It's a lovely surprise.

13:11.441 --> 13:13.250
Thank you, son.

13:13.355 --> 13:17.286
Did you follow the recipe to the letter?

13:17.391 --> 13:18.296
Ah.

13:18.400 --> 13:22.122
Oh-- Proper good cook, see?

13:22.227 --> 13:23.862
Just strayed from the book a bit.

13:23.966 --> 13:25.358
It said, add sugar.

13:25.462 --> 13:27.932
But you don't add sugar to hot food, do ya?

13:28.037 --> 13:29.533
So you replaced it with--

13:29.637 --> 13:31.134
Mango chutney.

13:31.238 --> 13:32.734
I like getting curried, and that.

13:35.865 --> 13:37.152
Mango bolognese?

13:37.256 --> 13:38.684
[laughter]

13:38.788 --> 13:39.971
Yeah.

13:40.075 --> 13:40.910
Delicious.

13:45.572 --> 13:48.146
Pass the salt, please, Mimi.

13:48.251 --> 13:49.156
Certainly.

13:52.740 --> 13:53.609
Oops.

13:57.019 --> 13:58.167
Can we have the room, please?

14:03.037 --> 14:03.873
He means get out.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.022
This stops now.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.033
Her name was Maureen.

14:18.137 --> 14:19.390
Don't you fucking dare--

14:19.494 --> 14:20.677
I will not live like this.

14:20.781 --> 14:22.103
If it's all out in the open, I've got

14:22.208 --> 14:23.738
nothing left hanging over me.

14:23.843 --> 14:24.817
I don't want to know.

14:24.922 --> 14:27.949
Tough fucking titty.

14:28.053 --> 14:29.410
Maureen.

14:29.514 --> 14:30.802
And I fell head over heels for her,

14:30.906 --> 14:32.437
like an imbecilic schoolboy.

14:32.541 --> 14:34.003
Don't ask why, cause I don't know.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.368
Something lacking at home, maybe?

14:36.473 --> 14:39.186
A marriage long gone stagnant?

14:39.290 --> 14:40.230
Certainly.

14:40.334 --> 14:42.908
But I am not the betraying kind, Mimi.

14:43.013 --> 14:44.162
Never have been.

14:44.266 --> 14:45.935
Throughout our marriage.

14:46.040 --> 14:52.512
This woman-- she had something.

14:55.712 --> 14:58.356
And I fell.

14:58.460 --> 15:01.279
Had something, did she?

15:04.062 --> 15:07.403
She was special, was she?

15:17.179 --> 15:19.231
You've crossed a line, Paddy.

15:19.336 --> 15:20.866
You should have left it unsaid.

15:27.547 --> 15:29.460
Fucking Irish.

15:29.564 --> 15:30.400
Fucking scum!

15:33.914 --> 15:37.914
Slapper with a sob story!

15:38.019 --> 15:40.385
Deceitful.

15:40.489 --> 15:42.855
Fucking excuse for a man!

15:42.959 --> 15:47.552
A real man would stand by his family!

15:47.657 --> 15:49.187
Stand by his wife!

16:00.599 --> 16:01.434
Fuck.

16:08.706 --> 16:10.062
[moaning]

16:10.167 --> 16:13.298
He's got us over a barrel.

16:13.402 --> 16:15.734
[moaning]

16:20.952 --> 16:22.100
What do you think you're doing?

16:22.205 --> 16:23.631
Your mom's in there. - Put it back on.

16:23.735 --> 16:27.562
And don't let the door hit your fat ass on the way out.

16:27.666 --> 16:29.407
If you value your bollocks, lads, I

16:29.511 --> 16:30.485
suggest you make an exit.

16:30.589 --> 16:31.598
Now.

16:34.590 --> 16:36.295
You're a fucking crook and a liar.

16:36.399 --> 16:37.478
And so is she.

16:37.582 --> 16:38.869
Your mom and dad were trying to protect you.

16:38.975 --> 16:40.157
They were looking after the money.

16:40.261 --> 16:41.896
Told us our dad was dead.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.150
Cause it's always about the money.

16:43.254 --> 16:44.784
- That's not true. - What do you know?

16:44.889 --> 16:47.672
You're only here cause she's so desperate she'll shag anything.

16:50.525 --> 16:51.534
Well, I'm sorry.

16:54.595 --> 16:55.953
I'll do whatever I fucking like.

16:56.057 --> 16:56.927
I'm sorry.

17:01.797 --> 17:02.633
We need to talk.

17:09.382 --> 17:10.565
Light a match under me.

17:10.670 --> 17:11.992
You keep deep dry haddock on me arms.

17:12.096 --> 17:13.766
I've shared a room with him for long enough.

17:13.869 --> 17:15.401
I think I know what his tastes are.

17:15.506 --> 17:19.854
What, and they're stuck in 1983, are they?

17:19.959 --> 17:20.792
I'm fucking starving.

17:20.897 --> 17:23.786
Does anyone fancy--

17:23.890 --> 17:25.351
Sorry.

17:25.454 --> 17:26.326
Needed the tape.

17:30.605 --> 17:33.911
There's four rolls on the table.

17:34.015 --> 17:34.849
Oh, yeah.

17:34.954 --> 17:35.963
So there is.

17:36.067 --> 17:36.902
Pizza.

17:37.007 --> 17:39.338
I'm going for pizza.

17:39.442 --> 17:40.903
No anchovies.

17:41.007 --> 17:42.017
They make me gag.

17:53.846 --> 17:55.655
Good day?

17:55.760 --> 17:57.673
Brilliant.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.656
He was really wonderful with her.

17:59.761 --> 18:01.778
And me.

18:01.882 --> 18:03.797
But you know him in the biblical sense.

18:03.901 --> 18:04.771
Any good?

18:07.519 --> 18:09.398
I don't remember.

18:09.503 --> 18:10.755
Don't remember?

18:10.859 --> 18:12.424
Well, not even--

18:12.530 --> 18:13.642
[laughter]

18:13.746 --> 18:14.930
She wouldn't know.

18:15.034 --> 18:16.843
Never seen it.

18:16.947 --> 18:18.409
Nothing happened.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.575
Debbie was in no fit state to go home by myself.

18:21.679 --> 18:24.358
Since her mate had fucked off.

18:24.462 --> 18:25.889
I slept on the floor.

18:25.993 --> 18:28.324
You didn't even cop a feel while she were out of it?

18:28.429 --> 18:29.334
Max.

18:29.438 --> 18:30.969
99 blokes out of 100 would.

18:31.073 --> 18:35.248
If he didn't, that makes him weird.

18:35.352 --> 18:36.188
Same again?

18:36.292 --> 18:37.161
Oh, yes, ta.

18:43.494 --> 18:46.173
Tracy [inaudible],, psychology student

18:46.277 --> 18:48.052
at Pete's party on weekends.

18:48.156 --> 18:49.269
All coming back to her, then?

18:49.374 --> 18:50.660
No, not a fucking clue.

18:50.766 --> 18:51.635
Just ask her direct.

18:51.740 --> 18:52.783
I shouldn't need to.

18:52.888 --> 18:54.697
Look, I'm a really good shag, me.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.958
Max, tell her.

18:57.063 --> 18:59.776
I'm an open minded girl, but talking to your sister

18:59.881 --> 19:01.063
about the ins and outs of shagging

19:01.168 --> 19:02.351
you is a little bit creepy.

19:02.455 --> 19:03.291
Even for me.

19:14.911 --> 19:18.112
Pint and a Pampers, Frank?

19:18.216 --> 19:19.156
Oh, ha ha.

19:19.260 --> 19:20.304
Very fucking droll.

19:20.408 --> 19:24.235
just answer your call and pour us a pint.

19:24.339 --> 19:26.740
That was my grandmother's funeral this morning.

19:26.844 --> 19:28.131
For fuck's sake!

19:31.124 --> 19:33.176
So I-- well, that wasn't deliberate.

19:33.281 --> 19:36.655
What-- but I didn't--

19:36.760 --> 19:37.629
Fine.

19:37.735 --> 19:39.926
Shit in a bush, slap one stranger,

19:40.031 --> 19:43.787
and suddenly everyone's judge, jury, and fucking executioner.

19:58.017 --> 19:59.061
You're getting it on your vest.

20:04.558 --> 20:06.193
This is fucking humiliating!

20:06.299 --> 20:10.160
I look like a refugee out of a shit boy band!

20:10.264 --> 20:12.213
Your seduction techniques are crap.

20:12.317 --> 20:14.196
I'm only 10.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.388
Yeah, well, you'll always be single

20:16.492 --> 20:17.674
if this is the best you can do.

20:22.442 --> 20:25.364
What are you up to?

20:25.469 --> 20:26.547
Ah-- ah.

20:31.870 --> 20:33.957
Any better?

20:34.062 --> 20:35.558
Much.

20:35.662 --> 20:39.037
Still gonna floor that pillock next time I see him.

20:39.142 --> 20:40.186
You can't.

20:43.595 --> 20:44.465
He's my dad.

20:47.874 --> 20:48.953
Why didn't you say?

20:49.057 --> 20:50.623
Well, because I didn't want to spoil things.

20:50.727 --> 20:52.014
Thought you'd lie all day instead?

20:52.118 --> 20:52.989
Didn't I didn't lie.

20:53.093 --> 20:54.554
Yeah, you didn't tell the truth.

20:54.658 --> 20:56.050
He got pissed at a funeral. It's not a crime.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.268
Blackening my granny's reputation isn't that the best

20:57.372 --> 20:58.659
taste, though, is it? - It takes two.

20:58.765 --> 21:01.235
He was only 15.

21:01.339 --> 21:03.322
I can't believe you're defending him.

21:03.426 --> 21:04.887
Against the likes of you?

21:04.992 --> 21:05.827
Always.

21:12.611 --> 21:14.664
It's a cold night, Frank.

21:14.768 --> 21:18.978
Something tells us you're not socializing out here by choice.

21:19.083 --> 21:21.866
Something tells us you're not socializing out here by choice.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.667
What a day, eh?

21:26.772 --> 21:29.520
Lookie what I have.

21:29.625 --> 21:31.921
Don't bother coming home tonight!

21:32.025 --> 21:34.878
You're an embarrassment!

21:34.982 --> 21:36.617
It wasn't my fault!

21:36.722 --> 21:38.670
No, Dad, it never is.

21:38.774 --> 21:39.714
Never.

21:39.818 --> 21:42.010
Yet it always, always fucking happens!

21:46.255 --> 21:47.160
Told you.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.481
Try listening.

21:51.369 --> 21:53.839
You can always spoon in with me.

21:53.944 --> 21:55.300
I'll get a bed.

21:55.404 --> 21:56.588
Very popular, I am.

22:08.069 --> 22:09.356
Hello?

22:09.461 --> 22:10.331
Yvonne?

22:13.705 --> 22:15.584
YVONNE: So it wasn't a scam.

22:15.688 --> 22:17.602
It wasn't done to hurt ya.

22:17.706 --> 22:20.837
We had to fake your dad's death to protect all of us.

22:20.943 --> 22:25.152
We have to continue on just like before, Meena.

22:25.256 --> 22:26.300
I'm going to bed.

22:26.404 --> 22:27.970
I'll put the kettle on.

22:45.505 --> 22:48.253
Just want some shelter.

22:48.358 --> 22:50.411
Oh, and maybe a bit of heat.

22:50.515 --> 22:51.559
Aw.

23:01.266 --> 23:02.797
It's like death in here.

23:10.625 --> 23:12.608
Never doubted you for a minute.

23:15.356 --> 23:17.409
It has to be clean.

23:17.514 --> 23:19.114
And only when I say.

23:19.219 --> 23:20.471
I don't want any of the kids there.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.499
Don't underestimate him.

23:27.603 --> 23:30.596
Once I walk out of here, there's no changing your mind.

23:34.005 --> 23:34.875
He's done his worst.

23:34.979 --> 23:35.883
It's my turn now.

23:40.963 --> 23:45.486
And Terry-- not the face. I want an open coffin.

24:01.073 --> 24:01.908
What?

24:08.101 --> 24:09.944
MIMI: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

24:12.519 --> 24:17.112
It's been-- well, too long since my last confession.

24:17.216 --> 24:19.478
And I have made a terrible decision.

24:19.582 --> 24:22.435
A life changing decision.

24:22.539 --> 24:25.601
I know it's a sin, and I am sorry.

24:25.705 --> 24:26.749
But I've got no choice.

24:29.219 --> 24:31.967
I'm going through with it, regardless

24:32.073 --> 24:33.464
of what you tell me today.

24:36.178 --> 24:39.239
And I want the Lord to know I do it with a heavy heart.

24:43.031 --> 24:44.841
Are you with me, Father?

24:44.945 --> 24:45.710
[coughing]

24:45.814 --> 24:48.112
(MASKING VOICE) Yes, yes, I--

24:48.216 --> 24:51.382
continue, my child.

24:51.486 --> 24:54.060
Have you got a cold?

24:54.164 --> 24:55.452
Allergy.

24:55.557 --> 24:58.653
Altar wine.

24:58.758 --> 25:01.645
I'm going to murder my husband.

25:01.749 --> 25:03.211
Well, not personally.

25:03.315 --> 25:04.463
I've arranged to have it done.

25:07.282 --> 25:09.369
I'll understand if you want me to leave.

25:12.743 --> 25:13.405
No.

25:13.509 --> 25:14.553
Go on.

25:17.998 --> 25:19.424
I hope you've got a free hour.

25:28.053 --> 25:29.792
MAN: I can do this.

25:29.896 --> 25:32.018
WOMAN: And what do the eggshells do, then?

25:32.122 --> 25:34.175
What did you do?

25:34.280 --> 25:35.428
What?

25:35.532 --> 25:38.316
With Tracy-- what's her fucking name?

25:38.420 --> 25:39.881
What did you do?

25:39.985 --> 25:42.838
Let me see if we can find out where you're going wrong.

25:42.942 --> 25:46.944
Well-- first we sort of--

25:49.623 --> 25:50.493
right.

25:50.597 --> 25:51.571
I had her like this.

25:51.675 --> 25:52.650
Fuck's sake.

25:52.754 --> 25:55.189
It would help if you spoke the language.

25:55.294 --> 25:56.685
Right, pretend I'm her.

25:56.790 --> 25:58.043
Where should I be?

25:58.147 --> 26:01.278
Um-- on your back, I suppose.

26:01.383 --> 26:03.400
And where are you?

26:03.505 --> 26:05.627
Sort of-- here.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.784
Doing what?

26:07.888 --> 26:10.915
You know-- mouth, and fingers, and stuff.

26:11.019 --> 26:15.020
- How long? - I wasn't timing it.

26:15.126 --> 26:16.064
I don't know.

26:16.169 --> 26:19.405
Um-- until my tongue was sore.

26:22.292 --> 26:23.127
Yeah?

26:23.232 --> 26:24.798
Nothing wrong there.

26:24.902 --> 26:26.015
Then what?

26:26.119 --> 26:27.268
Maybe a bit of--

26:30.712 --> 26:31.756
Well, something like this.

26:40.036 --> 26:43.167
Seems good.

26:43.272 --> 26:45.742
[phone ringing]

26:47.099 --> 26:49.151
Hello?

26:49.256 --> 26:52.213
It's her.

26:52.318 --> 26:53.222
[sigh]

27:00.320 --> 27:03.347
He didn't come home, then?

27:03.451 --> 27:05.190
What you did was wrong.

27:05.295 --> 27:07.592
Really fucking wrong.

27:07.696 --> 27:09.470
He's not as tough as he makes out.

27:34.346 --> 27:35.912
Don't know how you do it, mate.

27:36.016 --> 27:36.677
Honestly.

27:36.781 --> 27:38.173
I'm full of admiration.

27:50.628 --> 27:52.333
Up with the lark?

27:52.438 --> 27:53.690
Got a lot on me mind.

27:53.794 --> 27:56.961
Anything I can do to ease the burden?

27:57.065 --> 27:59.640
Not particularly.

27:59.744 --> 28:02.562
This tension-- this fucking atmosphere

28:02.667 --> 28:05.137
all the time between you two--

28:05.241 --> 28:06.459
it's cancerous.

28:06.563 --> 28:08.512
Your mother and I are working through our problems.

28:08.616 --> 28:10.217
Isn't that right?

28:10.321 --> 28:10.982
Takes time.

28:11.086 --> 28:13.034
That's all.

28:13.138 --> 28:15.122
What needs to be done will be done.

28:19.158 --> 28:20.515
Good.

28:20.619 --> 28:22.463
As long as you're prepared to work at it.

28:33.735 --> 28:35.892
He doesn't even like her.

28:35.997 --> 28:37.319
What's it to you?

28:37.423 --> 28:38.258
Nothing.

28:41.946 --> 28:45.321
Don't want him making a dick of himself.

28:45.426 --> 28:48.766
I mean, she ain't all that.

28:48.870 --> 28:49.948
Just tell him you like him.

28:52.801 --> 28:55.028
- Aw-- - What are you talking about?

29:00.525 --> 29:03.030
I know he's your brother, Debs, but I

29:03.134 --> 29:05.779
can't stop thinking about him.

29:05.883 --> 29:06.822
Oh, shut up!

29:06.927 --> 29:10.198
I don't want to hear this!

29:10.302 --> 29:11.137
I said--

29:11.241 --> 29:13.607
[mumbling]

29:15.521 --> 29:17.677
I was playing hard to get.

29:17.782 --> 29:21.331
He was supposed to pick up on the signals.

29:21.435 --> 29:23.384
What, you think you've got problems?

29:23.488 --> 29:24.462
Hello?

29:24.566 --> 29:27.071
Earth calling planet fucking ollie ox.

29:27.176 --> 29:28.845
I met a bloke, I slept with him

29:28.950 --> 29:30.203
before I even knew his name.

29:30.307 --> 29:31.838
Smart Why are you torturing me?

29:31.942 --> 29:36.222
I called his granny a slapper, and then walked out on him.

29:36.326 --> 29:37.752
And I think I love him.

29:54.696 --> 29:55.426
Ah.

29:55.530 --> 29:56.888
So have you tried listening?

29:56.992 --> 29:58.001
Listening?

29:58.106 --> 30:00.506
I know things no person should ever know.

30:00.611 --> 30:02.211
And if I say, I'm fucked.

30:02.315 --> 30:04.577
If I don't say, I'm fucked.

30:04.681 --> 30:07.082
You have ruined my life.

30:07.186 --> 30:09.239
Oh, it's not even lunchtime.

30:13.136 --> 30:15.362
Francis.

30:15.467 --> 30:16.928
A word.

30:17.032 --> 30:18.250
Oh, for fuck's sake.

30:26.983 --> 30:28.131
Have you really fainted?

30:30.705 --> 30:31.575
No.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.689
Then come and spend some time.

30:36.794 --> 30:39.021
Mano a mano.

30:39.125 --> 30:40.586
I thought maybe I'm more worried

30:40.690 --> 30:45.248
about you, and your weird notions of what gay men like.

30:45.352 --> 30:47.023
Or even for listening to you.

30:47.127 --> 30:48.240
You're leaving again?

30:48.345 --> 30:49.597
Yeah, Liam, I am.

30:49.701 --> 30:50.849
I want to be, happy and I'm not going

30:50.955 --> 30:53.285
to find it two doors away.

30:53.389 --> 30:54.990
Why not?

30:55.094 --> 30:56.660
Because we're not an endangered species.

30:56.765 --> 30:59.756
We don't have to mate with the first gay bloke we see.

30:59.860 --> 31:02.088
You don't have to go halfway across the world, either.

31:02.192 --> 31:03.201
It's exactly the same.

31:03.306 --> 31:04.628
Just hotter.

31:04.732 --> 31:05.636
Fine.

31:05.740 --> 31:07.445
I'll be a lonely puff with a sun tan.

31:07.549 --> 31:08.593
So you admit it, then?

31:12.073 --> 31:12.978
Admit what?

31:13.082 --> 31:13.917
That you're lonely.

31:26.233 --> 31:27.555
I'll catch up with ya.

31:32.148 --> 31:33.192
So what?

31:33.296 --> 31:34.722
Striking out on your own?

31:34.827 --> 31:35.731
Maybe.

31:35.836 --> 31:36.949
So as long as I stump you the cash--

31:37.053 --> 31:38.132
I don't need you.

31:38.236 --> 31:39.106
Is this what you'd like?

31:42.516 --> 31:43.629
Cause if it is, go ahead.

31:46.586 --> 31:48.570
If you hate me that much.

31:48.674 --> 31:49.996
Ma, I don't hate you.

31:50.100 --> 31:51.875
I'd gladly do it, Chesney.

31:51.979 --> 31:53.962
For you or Meena.

31:54.067 --> 31:57.198
Cause that's what it's like when you have kids.

31:57.302 --> 32:00.398
You love them more than the air you fucking breathe.

32:00.502 --> 32:01.894
Yeah, right.

32:01.999 --> 32:05.617
Do you think this is the life I dreamt for myself?

32:05.721 --> 32:06.556
We have no choice.

32:09.827 --> 32:12.819
Stop fucking hiding, Chesney!

32:12.923 --> 32:14.071
We were going to be on the street.

32:14.176 --> 32:15.046
No income.

32:15.150 --> 32:16.090
Money, money, money.

32:16.194 --> 32:17.342
Not fucking money!

32:25.796 --> 32:26.944
I love you, son.

32:36.199 --> 32:37.765
[clattering]

32:41.383 --> 32:42.496
Chesney, please!

32:45.732 --> 32:48.098
Hey.

32:48.202 --> 32:52.307
What's with the Cheshire Cat look 24/7?

32:52.413 --> 32:53.873
Nothing.

32:53.978 --> 32:56.552
Just wish it could always be like this.

32:56.656 --> 32:57.979
Like what?

32:58.083 --> 32:59.266
Us three.

32:59.371 --> 33:00.971
Having a laugh, getting on.

33:01.075 --> 33:03.580
Why shouldn't it be?

33:03.684 --> 33:06.120
Because real life gets in the way.

33:06.224 --> 33:08.834
No reason why.

33:08.938 --> 33:09.600
Business is good.

33:09.704 --> 33:11.617
Come and work for me.

33:11.721 --> 33:13.600
Spend every day together.

33:13.705 --> 33:14.679
Well, why not?

33:14.783 --> 33:16.036
You'd be brilliant.

33:18.749 --> 33:22.716
Even better-- marry me.

33:22.820 --> 33:23.690
Joe?

33:23.794 --> 33:24.629
She should hear it.

33:24.733 --> 33:25.673
It concerns her, too.

33:29.744 --> 33:30.579
So?

33:30.683 --> 33:33.362
Will ya?

33:33.466 --> 33:35.171
I just fucking told him straight.

33:35.275 --> 33:36.597
Then I were like, oi.

33:36.702 --> 33:37.850
Sort it out.

33:37.955 --> 33:39.346
I think it's made a difference.

33:39.450 --> 33:40.702
I dunno, Shane.

33:40.808 --> 33:43.661
There's a lot of hurt. - They said they'd try.

33:43.765 --> 33:44.913
Didn't they, Kel?

33:45.017 --> 33:46.409
Tell him.

33:46.514 --> 33:50.096
Well, I wasn't exactly feeling the love in the room.

33:50.202 --> 33:51.558
- Pint? - Yeah.

33:51.662 --> 33:52.498
Please, mate.

34:00.325 --> 34:03.214
Mickey! Just come out.

34:03.318 --> 34:04.187
I saw ya.

34:13.929 --> 34:16.016
What are you doing?

34:16.121 --> 34:17.512
Not getting humiliated anymore.

34:17.618 --> 34:19.357
What, and locking yourself in the public toilet's

34:19.460 --> 34:21.304
the dignified response, is it?

34:21.409 --> 34:23.288
What was that shit all about last night?

34:23.391 --> 34:24.226
Yeah, go on.

34:24.331 --> 34:25.724
Laugh it up.

34:25.828 --> 34:26.663
I'm not laughing.

34:26.766 --> 34:29.655
It was Liam's idea.

34:29.759 --> 34:32.577
I haven't thought about you in--

34:32.681 --> 34:33.795
a long time.

34:33.899 --> 34:36.056
You know, I've moved on.

34:36.161 --> 34:39.466
But he talked me into it.

34:39.571 --> 34:41.136
I made a dick of myself.

34:41.239 --> 34:42.179
You didn't make a dick--

34:42.284 --> 34:43.155
Yes, I did.

34:46.076 --> 34:48.268
But it's all right.

34:48.373 --> 34:49.313
It's a reminder.

34:49.417 --> 34:50.739
Of what?

34:50.842 --> 34:52.373
To look after myself first and last.

34:52.478 --> 34:53.313
Mickey--

34:53.418 --> 34:55.331
No, I'm cool.

34:55.436 --> 34:57.940
Seriously.

34:58.045 --> 34:59.855
Just go out and do your own thing, Ian.

35:03.020 --> 35:05.003
I won't lose any sleep.

35:10.849 --> 35:12.031
10p.

35:12.136 --> 35:14.814
Add it to your fund.

35:14.919 --> 35:17.250
I ain't got a fund yet.

35:17.354 --> 35:19.025
Having second thoughts?

35:19.129 --> 35:21.147
You're a shit stirring little bastard.

35:32.245 --> 35:33.776
Something to say?

35:33.880 --> 35:34.750
Nope.

35:42.996 --> 35:44.075
[knocking]

35:45.675 --> 35:46.510
Hi.

35:46.614 --> 35:47.623
Is Debbie in?

35:47.727 --> 35:48.980
Are you the new boyfriend?

35:49.084 --> 35:49.919
Um, no.

35:50.023 --> 35:53.086
Uh-- not exactly.

35:53.190 --> 35:54.164
Debbie?

35:54.268 --> 35:56.182
Your new boyfriend's here.

36:02.270 --> 36:04.567
I was out of line.

36:04.671 --> 36:06.411
I'm sorry.

36:06.515 --> 36:08.498
I like you.

36:08.602 --> 36:11.560
You're funny, and spunky, and loyal.

36:14.831 --> 36:16.222
And beautiful.

36:16.327 --> 36:19.318
I like being with you.

36:19.423 --> 36:20.328
Is that it?

36:20.432 --> 36:21.476
More or less.

36:31.531 --> 36:33.653
You hear all of that?

36:33.757 --> 36:35.775
Every word.

36:35.880 --> 36:36.714
Good.

36:49.970 --> 36:52.510
I admit it, I was legging it to the funeral

36:52.614 --> 36:53.971
for the free swallow.

36:54.075 --> 36:55.954
Don't want to know about my childrens' love

36:56.058 --> 36:58.181
lives, or my neighbors' insurance scams,

36:58.285 --> 37:00.025
stroke deaths falsification.

37:00.129 --> 37:06.774
It is not my place to be aware of marital struggles of dear,

37:06.878 --> 37:09.941
dear friends whom I consider extended family.

37:10.045 --> 37:12.968
I'm weighed down by too much information, Paddy.

37:16.308 --> 37:19.265
I have no fucking clue what you just said.

37:19.369 --> 37:22.326
And why in God's name do you think it would interest me?

37:22.430 --> 37:25.944
You-- you brought me here to--

37:26.049 --> 37:31.199
you were gonna-- because--

37:31.303 --> 37:33.425
you know I know.

37:33.529 --> 37:38.331
Know what

37:38.435 --> 37:39.270
Nothing.

37:44.245 --> 37:46.158
Someone intends to do me harm.

37:46.263 --> 37:49.638
I don't yet know who to trust.

37:49.742 --> 37:52.873
So your role here is a double edged insurance policy.

37:52.978 --> 37:55.935
On the one hand, you'll serve as a witness to what is said.

37:56.039 --> 37:57.779
You're going to try and talk him out of it?

37:57.884 --> 37:59.206
Hell no.

37:59.310 --> 38:03.381
I'm going to offer him twice the fee to shoot my wife.

38:03.485 --> 38:04.911
[bell ringing]

38:06.860 --> 38:07.973
My other role?

38:08.077 --> 38:10.130
You're my human shield, Francis.

38:30.448 --> 38:31.318
Why?

38:31.422 --> 38:32.466
Why, though?

38:32.570 --> 38:35.180
Paddy, why reveal all this information to me?

38:35.285 --> 38:37.024
I am totally unreliable.

38:37.129 --> 38:38.312
Well known for letting down all in--

38:38.416 --> 38:39.216
- Shut the fuck up. - Come on.

38:39.321 --> 38:40.747
Paddy. Paddy.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.104
Paddy.

38:42.208 --> 38:43.043
You can't do it.

38:43.148 --> 38:44.783
You can't kill your wife.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.349
Yes, she may be the [inaudible] from Hell,

38:46.453 --> 38:47.427
but that's beside the point.

38:47.531 --> 38:49.793
She took a contract out on me!

38:49.897 --> 38:51.185
Yes-- yeah, fair point, but--

38:51.289 --> 38:51.950
yeah.

38:52.054 --> 38:54.107
But-- and-- yeah.

38:54.212 --> 38:55.881
And more fool there for getting one

38:55.985 --> 38:57.065
of your colleagues to do it.

38:57.169 --> 38:58.560
You're flapping like a teenage girl.

38:58.664 --> 38:59.918
I--

39:00.022 --> 39:01.691
Keep a low profile.

39:01.795 --> 39:04.822
If it goes belly up for me, give a statement.

39:04.927 --> 39:08.859
If it goes in my favor, I'll let you keep your legs

39:08.963 --> 39:10.007
in return for your silence.

39:40.484 --> 39:42.015
[knocking]

39:47.965 --> 39:48.938
Can we talk?

39:58.889 --> 40:01.012
Nothing to talk about.

40:01.116 --> 40:04.178
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

40:04.282 --> 40:06.057
What for?

40:06.161 --> 40:08.318
For always blanking you.

40:08.423 --> 40:10.300
And not treating you with respect.

40:10.406 --> 40:13.259
Yeah, well, cheers.

40:13.363 --> 40:14.371
Enjoy France.

40:14.475 --> 40:16.424
[inaudible] is in Spain.

40:16.529 --> 40:18.025
And I'm not going.

40:21.573 --> 40:23.731
Not yet, anyway.

40:23.835 --> 40:26.514
I'm not ready to leave yet.

40:26.618 --> 40:27.697
How come?

40:27.801 --> 40:28.845
Don't push it.

40:32.567 --> 40:34.064
Kettle only takes a minute to boil.

40:47.841 --> 40:49.824
He's still there.

40:49.929 --> 40:50.798
Three hours.

40:50.902 --> 40:53.512
I don't care.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.947
You've got a nice looking fella prepared

40:56.052 --> 40:58.035
to sit in the middle of a public thoroughfare

40:58.140 --> 41:00.470
with no toilet break, just in the hope

41:00.575 --> 41:01.758
that you might talk to him.

41:04.576 --> 41:06.072
You said you loved him this morning.

41:06.176 --> 41:07.672
No I didn't.

41:07.777 --> 41:09.551
No, I said maybe.

41:09.656 --> 41:10.699
I might.

41:15.953 --> 41:16.892
I'm meeting her for a drink.

41:16.996 --> 41:17.867
Yeah, what do you want?

41:17.971 --> 41:18.910
A medal?

41:19.015 --> 41:20.059
Freaks.

41:24.999 --> 41:26.912
Well?

41:27.017 --> 41:29.835
I'm not talking to him.

41:29.939 --> 41:30.879
No-- treat him mean.

41:35.227 --> 41:37.106
I'm going for a walk.

41:37.210 --> 41:38.532
To the Jockey, by any chance?

41:38.637 --> 41:39.507
No.

41:46.291 --> 41:47.335
Stood you up, has she?

41:47.439 --> 41:48.100
No.

41:48.205 --> 41:49.214
She's a bit late.

41:49.318 --> 41:51.510
That's all.

41:51.614 --> 41:53.841
You want to get the priorities right in your head, Carl.

41:53.946 --> 41:54.885
How so?

41:54.989 --> 41:56.276
You don't even care about this bird.

41:56.380 --> 41:58.816
Some girl you'll likely never see again.

41:58.921 --> 42:00.938
You should focus your energies on the future.

42:03.444 --> 42:04.313
Which is?

42:13.777 --> 42:15.412
Twins?

42:15.516 --> 42:16.351
I didn't shag her.

42:16.456 --> 42:17.500
I shagged her!

42:22.266 --> 42:24.666
Her sister.

42:24.771 --> 42:26.302
I shagged her sister.

42:43.489 --> 42:45.020
Where'd you get the chair?

42:45.124 --> 42:46.272
My house.

42:46.376 --> 42:48.638
Got a car?

42:48.742 --> 42:50.725
Brought it on the bus.

42:50.830 --> 42:52.292
So you planned this?

42:52.396 --> 42:54.309
If you'd spoke to me earlier, I wouldn't have needed it.

42:54.413 --> 42:55.770
Then I'd just be an idiot who carried

42:55.874 --> 42:58.450
the chair across Manchester on a bus for no reason.

42:58.554 --> 43:01.615
It's not cute, you know?

43:01.720 --> 43:04.434
Could be seen as creepy. You know, like a stalker?

43:08.643 --> 43:10.557
So you're just going to sit there?

43:10.661 --> 43:11.531
Yep.

43:11.635 --> 43:14.315
Why?

43:14.419 --> 43:16.019
Because you kissed me.

43:16.124 --> 43:17.863
And you don't strike me as the type of girl

43:17.967 --> 43:19.638
who just kisses anybody.

43:19.742 --> 43:20.612
Suit yourself.

43:24.265 --> 43:26.213
Look round.

43:26.317 --> 43:27.848
Come on, look round.

44:01.945 --> 44:02.988
Mimi Maguire!

44:05.633 --> 44:09.077
Katherine Mary Joy Maguire!

44:09.181 --> 44:10.607
Get your big old ass out here!

44:29.082 --> 44:30.090
So here we are.

44:38.128 --> 44:42.129
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

44:42.233 --> 44:43.521
What are you waiting for?

44:43.625 --> 44:45.712
I don't think so, Mimi.

44:45.817 --> 44:47.800
See, I've also compensated young Terrance

44:47.904 --> 44:50.827
here to take a pop at you.

44:50.931 --> 44:52.427
Two for one.

44:52.532 --> 44:53.610
Spring seal.

44:53.714 --> 44:55.802
It's never too late to think again, you know?

44:55.906 --> 44:59.177
My thoughts precisely.

44:59.281 --> 45:04.013
It's none or both, Mimi.

45:04.117 --> 45:05.613
What do you think?

45:11.632 --> 45:14.242
I fucking hate you!

45:14.346 --> 45:15.459
I understand.

45:18.521 --> 45:19.356
And I'm sorry.

45:23.183 --> 45:24.610
I'm not too fond of myself, neither.

45:27.811 --> 45:29.237
That's why changes have to happen,

45:29.341 --> 45:32.785
whether you like them or not.

45:32.890 --> 45:35.673
He did stray from the fold, Mimi,

45:35.778 --> 45:37.552
but it was never consummated.

45:37.656 --> 45:39.361
I mean, what man doesn't window shop?

45:39.465 --> 45:41.588
- How the fuck do you know that? - Yes.

45:41.692 --> 45:42.562
How do you know?

45:48.025 --> 45:49.660
Intuition.

45:49.764 --> 45:51.851
Empathy.

45:51.956 --> 45:53.418
What changes?

45:53.522 --> 45:55.888
Fundamental ones.

45:55.992 --> 45:58.775
The kind that take a long time to negotiate.

46:03.471 --> 46:06.742
Call it off, Terry.

46:06.847 --> 46:07.925
You can go now, Terry.

46:08.029 --> 46:08.968
I think we can deal with this.

46:09.074 --> 46:11.266
No, it's gone too far, Paddy.

46:11.370 --> 46:12.831
What are you talking about?

46:12.935 --> 46:15.092
What, you don't think I do this for the profit margin,

46:15.197 --> 46:16.519
do ya?

46:16.623 --> 46:18.398
See, I've made arrangements with certain parties

46:18.502 --> 46:21.737
about business opportunities in this area.

46:21.842 --> 46:23.964
A lot of people are going to be very happy to see

46:24.069 --> 46:25.634
the back of you two.

46:25.738 --> 46:27.409
Look, it's not really my argument.

46:27.513 --> 46:28.557
I'd just be cannon fodder.

46:28.661 --> 46:30.609
Do not move a fucking muscle!

46:30.714 --> 46:32.419
Well, I've got a Dicky Tommy.

46:36.489 --> 46:37.985
You [inaudible] bitch.

46:56.286 --> 46:57.921
Who the fuck are you?

46:58.025 --> 46:59.069
Debbie's new boyfriend.

46:59.173 --> 47:00.669
No he's not!

47:00.773 --> 47:03.522
Yes he is.

47:03.626 --> 47:06.445
You love him.

47:06.549 --> 47:09.611
She is infatuated with Carl.

47:09.716 --> 47:11.942
They have run two insurance scams now

47:12.046 --> 47:15.490
over Kash's death, which they may actually have played a part

47:15.596 --> 47:17.056
in, willing or otherwise.

47:17.161 --> 47:20.048
And these two took out hits on each other

47:20.153 --> 47:22.519
because he had an ultimately unsuccessful

47:22.623 --> 47:25.024
dalliance with a psycho who turned

47:25.128 --> 47:26.485
him into a heroin addict.

47:26.589 --> 47:30.138
And I don't ever want to talk to any of you

47:30.242 --> 47:31.634
again about anything!

47:31.739 --> 47:34.660
I have no desire to know.

47:34.766 --> 47:36.122
Is that enough listening for ya?

47:39.323 --> 47:42.106
Tell me again about your relationship expertise,

47:42.211 --> 47:43.324
sweetheart.

47:54.249 --> 47:56.197
[clattering]

48:11.680 --> 48:14.497
DEBBIE (VOICEOVER): Information is a dangerous commodity.

48:14.601 --> 48:16.654
If it's misused and misunderstood,

48:16.759 --> 48:18.951
it can have real consequences.

48:19.055 --> 48:22.290
But information is only words.

48:22.396 --> 48:24.274
Actions speak louder.

48:24.378 --> 48:25.596
Much louder.

48:41.566 --> 48:44.140
[moaning]

48:48.420 --> 48:51.447
[theme music]

49:29.961 --> 49:32.117
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

49:32.222 --> 49:35.736
I've been having impure thoughts, Father.

49:35.841 --> 49:37.163
Oh.

49:37.267 --> 49:37.963
About whom?

49:38.067 --> 49:39.355
Is it necessary to say?

49:39.459 --> 49:42.695
If one wishes the Lord's forgiveness.

49:42.799 --> 49:44.678
Well, it's Frank.

49:44.782 --> 49:46.104
Frank Gallagher.

49:46.209 --> 49:50.244
He sends a quiver through me loins.

49:50.349 --> 49:52.750
Father?

49:52.854 --> 49:53.967
Father?

49:54.072 --> 49:55.672
Father?
