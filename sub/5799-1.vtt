Apparently,
he pissed all over
the front of his pants.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.355

that's because
he's six.

become partners

Yo, Payne!

You know, I heard
you've been giving
these boys a hard time.

44:12.108 --> 44:16.821
In fact,
I heard you couldn't cut it
in a real man's military!

44:17.447 --> 44:20.158
I heard that it's time
for you to leave.

44:20.700 --> 44:21.993
Yeah.

44:23.119 --> 44:24.787
Know what I heard?

44:24.871 --> 44:28.833
I heard your mother
was so fat, she played
pool with the planets.

44:32.545 --> 44:33.629
Yes!

44:36.007 --> 44:38.259
You thinking about leaving yet?

44:40.762 --> 44:44.974
Well, actually, I think
the party just begun.

44:45.099 --> 44:46.601

44:48.895 --> 44:52.565

is take this right foot

44:52.648 --> 44:54.768
and I'm gonna put it
across the left side
of your face.

45:21.844 --> 45:24.263
Oh, children.

45:25.515 --> 45:29.227

for this blood
from my lip.

45:30.436 --> 45:31.896

45:32.688 --> 45:35.066
I wanna know who's responsible.

45:38.152 --> 45:40.488
Don't all run at once.

45:41.739 --> 45:44.367
I guess nobody's responsible.

45:44.659 --> 45:48.246

that one coming.

45:49.539 --> 45:52.083
Well, you know
what y'all got coming?

46:04.387 --> 46:05.429
Sir.

46:06.931 --> 46:08.266
Yes, turd?

46:10.142 --> 46:12.228
It was me, sir.
I hired him.

46:12.353 --> 46:14.939
Well, that's one
death warrant signed.

46:15.648 --> 46:18.317

What about you, brown nose?

46:22.655 --> 46:24.407
I acted alone, sir.

46:24.782 --> 46:28.077
The rest of the squad
was unaware
of my activities.

46:30.746 --> 46:33.583
That's a pretty bold
move there, Mr. Stone.

46:35.626 --> 46:38.379
What do you think
I ought to do with you?

46:39.171 --> 46:40.840
I don't know, sir.

46:42.675 --> 46:44.302
You don't know.

46:45.303 --> 46:48.097
I guess you should
probably expel me, sir.

46:48.931 --> 46:51.893
What, and send you
on a vacation?

46:53.269 --> 46:54.395

You are no longer
the squad leader.

46:59.275 --> 47:03.237
Stone, you are now
cadet sergeant.

47:04.363 --> 47:07.408
If these men win the
Virginia Military Games,

47:07.491 --> 47:10.828
it'll be because
you have led them
to a victory.

47:11.871 --> 47:16.792
If they lose,
it'll be because
you failed them.

47:19.503 --> 47:21.297
I don't accept
that responsibility.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.716
It's not negotiable.

47:29.472 --> 47:33.476
If I'm the new squad leader,
my first order is
to screw you, sir!

47:34.477 --> 47:36.562
What did you say to me, turd?

47:36.646 --> 47:39.857
Why don't you go
back to hell
where you came from?

47:41.442 --> 47:45.571
Boy, I am two seconds
from being on you
like white on rice

47:45.655 --> 47:48.616

I will put my foot
so far up your ass,

47:51.661 --> 47:54.622
the water on my knee
will quench your thirst.

47:54.997 --> 47:56.207
Try it.

48:02.964 --> 48:04.840
You want me gone, boy?

48:05.424 --> 48:06.926
Yes, sir.

48:07.009 --> 48:10.054
I said, do you
want me gone, soldier?

48:10.137 --> 48:11.889
Yes, sir!

48:12.556 --> 48:17.061
Then you meet me outside

at 2100 hours.

trophy from the Virginia
Military Games?

48:50.845 --> 48:53.055

48:54.181 --> 48:57.226
I want that trophy.

48:57.476 --> 49:00.855
If you turds can
bring me that trophy,

49:00.938 --> 49:03.482
I will resign my command.

49:04.316 --> 49:06.944
This is a black op, gentlemen.

49:07.028 --> 49:11.699
If you are discovered,
I will deny all knowledge,

49:11.782 --> 49:14.410
and you will pay the price.

49:15.661 --> 49:18.080
That is my deal.

49:19.498 --> 49:21.375
Do you accept it?

49:25.504 --> 49:28.507
Sir, yes, sir.

49:29.967 --> 49:32.470
Then bring me my trophy.

49:49.779 --> 49:51.238

All right, guys,
this is it.

49:51.322 --> 49:53.324
This is our big chance
to get rid of Payne.

49:53.407 --> 49:55.034
We got two miles
to get to Wellington.

out of there
as fast as we can.

last chance,

I'm gonna come and help
you make me look bad?

50:16.305 --> 50:17.681

50:17.765 --> 50:20.434
No, no, no.
You can't come.
You're too little.

50:20.518 --> 50:23.979

and guard the base, okay?

go on no black op.
They say I'm too little,

lets you do anything

about the

Let me tell you that story.

51:23.664 --> 51:25.499
Once upon a time,

51:26.167 --> 51:28.294
deep, deep in the jungle,

51:28.377 --> 51:30.921
there was a Little
Engine That Could.

51:31.380 --> 51:34.550
And he was
chugging his way
across the enemy line.

51:39.555 --> 51:41.432
This Little Engine's mission

51:41.557 --> 51:45.769
was to take some AK-47s
and a nuclear payload

51:45.853 --> 51:49.106
over the mountain
to the 2063 Battalion.

51:49.690 --> 51:54.403
Needless to say,
there was
plenty opposition.

51:55.070 --> 51:57.656
You think that stopped
the Little Engine
That Could?

51:57.740 --> 52:00.910
No, siree, Bob.
He just kept
chugging along.

they climbed
aboard the train

52:09.293 --> 52:11.837
and popped out the eyes
of the conductor,

52:11.921 --> 52:15.257
and blood and snot
was dripping out
his eye sockets.

You think that stopped
the Little Engine
That Could?

You know, that was
the first time

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:31.062
I ever drove
a man's nose up
into his brain

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:35.150
causing instant death
and simultaneous
bowel evacuation.

01:01:36.234 --> 01:01:39.154
But enough
about me, woman.
What's your story?

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:43.241
I'm surprised
you ain't dropped
about 12 puppies by now.

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:46.578
Ain't you never been married?

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:49.164
Yeah, I was.

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:52.042
What happened?
You terminate
his command?

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:54.836
No. Actually, he left.

01:01:56.505 --> 01:01:58.632
I wanted children.
He didn't.

01:02:00.509 --> 01:02:03.553
Any man that would
leave you ought
to be monkey stomped

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:06.598
and have his brains
mailed back
to his mother.

01:02:06.681 --> 01:02:08.266

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:10.393

01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:14.940
How about you?

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:17.484
Was there ever
a Mrs. Payne?

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:18.944
Negative.

01:02:19.027 --> 01:02:21.655
I figure if the
Marines wanted me
to have a wife,

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.073
they'd have issued me one.

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:24.616

01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:29.496
Well,

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:33.250
I had a really nice
time tonight, Benson.

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:37.420
Heck, being with you
is almost better
than cleaning my gun.

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:42.300
I got something for you.

01:02:42.384 --> 01:02:43.927
Oh, what is it?

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:45.637
It's a bullet.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.517
It's something special.

01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:53.228
It's from my heart.

01:02:56.064 --> 01:02:58.567
Really? Well,
where'd you get it?

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:00.485
From my heart.

01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:04.072
Left ventricle.
I took it out myself
with a field knife.

01:03:04.573 --> 01:03:06.700
And I want you to have that.

01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:11.079
Thank you, Benson.

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:30.599
Good night.

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:36.104
Good night, princess.

I might have made
a little anonymous call.

You didn't think
they were just gonna
hand it to you, did you?

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:36.665
We got the crap
kicked out of us
because of you.

Tonight wasn't

01:04:40.669 --> 01:04:43.254
It was about achieving
your objective.

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:46.341
Did you?

01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:49.386
Did you even see that trophy?

01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:52.222
Oh, I saw it.

01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:56.184
And when you saw it,
did you want it?

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:58.520
Yeah, to get rid of you.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:00.855
That's not what I asked.

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:03.024
Did you want it?

01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:05.527
I wanted it.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.697
Yeah.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.532
Deserve it?
Yeah.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.617

Oh, yeah.

01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:15.453
