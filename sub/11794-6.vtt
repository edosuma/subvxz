00:02.035 --> 00:03.737
( bell rings )

00:03.770 --> 00:06.773
 <i>* When I wake up in the</i>
 <i>morning and the alarm</i>
 <i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.806 --> 00:09.609
  <i>* I don't think</i>
  <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.642 --> 00:12.545
  <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
  <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.579 --> 00:16.248
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.282 --> 00:19.986
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.888 --> 00:24.858
   <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
   <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.891 --> 00:27.827
   <i>* And my dog ate</i>
   <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.861 --> 00:30.730
  <i>* Riding low on my chair</i>
  <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.764 --> 00:34.467
 <i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
 <i>it'll be all right</i>

00:34.501 --> 00:38.838
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:52.919 --> 00:56.056
 <i>* It's all right,</i>
 <i>'cause I'm saved by the</i>

00:56.089 --> 00:58.758
 <i>* It's all right,</i>
 <i>'cause I'm saved by the</i>

00:58.792 --> 01:02.662
 <i>* It's all right,</i>
 <i>'cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:14.774 --> 01:17.344
 Everyone hopes for that
 one shining moment...

01:17.377 --> 01:19.479
  Joe Montana
  in the Super Bowl,

01:19.512 --> 01:21.448
 Kirk Gibson
 in the World Series,

01:21.481 --> 01:24.317
  "Flo-Jo" in the Olympics,
  and today,

01:24.351 --> 01:28.755
  Zack Morris in the
  Bayside vs. Madison
  Cross-Country Meet.

01:30.123 --> 01:32.092
  Oh hi, Zack.
  How did you do in the race?

01:32.092 --> 01:34.094
Well, I don't like
to brag but...

01:34.127 --> 01:36.663
 Third place, Zack.
 That's great!

01:36.696 --> 01:38.665
   You know, I have a feeling
   that at some country fair

01:38.698 --> 01:42.002
   there is a prize bull
   wondering where
   his ribbon went.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.537
   Third place, wow!

01:44.571 --> 01:48.475
 I once finished
 fifth in an "ALF"
 look-a-like contest.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.978
For the first quarter mile,
I held back.

01:52.012 --> 01:54.147
  At the half mile,
  I was still in last place.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.949
 At the three-quarter mile,
 I heard this voice...

01:55.982 --> 01:59.185
 - Hey guys, look at this.
 - Slater, what a great trophy!

01:59.219 --> 02:02.922
   I won my weight
   class in the county
   wrestling championships.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.859
  - Wow, that's fabulous.
  - This is awesome.

02:05.892 --> 02:08.928
 Oh my gosh.
 That is so exciting.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.896
 You're a champion.
 I am so proud of you!

02:10.930 --> 02:13.833
  Then, ignoring the pain
  in my side, I made
  a mad dash to the finish...

02:13.867 --> 02:16.369
   Hey Zack, would you
   hold this for me, please?

02:16.403 --> 02:19.472
I want to hug Kelly
with both arms.

02:19.506 --> 02:21.941
 Oh Slater,
 put me down.

02:23.777 --> 02:26.379
  I can't watch this.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.882
  Let's hear it for our first
  county wrestling champion,

02:28.915 --> 02:31.551
 in fact, our first
 champion in anything,

02:31.584 --> 02:33.586
  AC Slater!

02:33.620 --> 02:35.655
 ( all cheer )

02:38.191 --> 02:40.960
Would you teach me
how to wrestle?

02:44.898 --> 02:47.934
   Slater, show me that hold
   you used to beat Johnson.

02:47.967 --> 02:50.437
  You know, that double-jointed
  torso stretcher.

02:50.470 --> 02:53.506
   Don't worry, Slater.
   I won't hurt you.

02:55.141 --> 02:57.110
  All right.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.546
 Oof!

02:59.579 --> 03:02.949
   Hey, this is
   pretty effective.

03:03.049 --> 03:05.919
  Thank you.

03:05.952 --> 03:09.823
( gasping )
I'll ease up if you do.

03:09.856 --> 03:13.560
   I'm just going to
   go help the nurse
   look for a contact lens.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.063
   ( girls squeal )

03:19.866 --> 03:21.868
   Hey Zack,
   Slater isn't that great.

03:21.901 --> 03:25.071
  You could do that too
  if you had muscles.

03:28.641 --> 03:31.845
  Excuse me.
  I'm Major Martin Slater.
  I'm looking for...

03:31.878 --> 03:34.614
- AC Slater's father?
- Affirmative.

03:34.647 --> 03:37.183
   Tell me, son, how do you
   find Mr. Belding?

03:37.217 --> 03:39.619
   Confused,
   but well-meaning.

03:39.652 --> 03:41.821
 He's not in his office.
 Where can I find him?

03:41.855 --> 03:45.091
  - He's with the school nurse.
  - Where's the school nurse?

03:45.091 --> 03:48.228
She's with Mr. Belding.

03:48.261 --> 03:51.765
  I know that.
  Where's her office?

03:53.900 --> 03:56.936
Then I'll go this way.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.440
  Zack, the nurse's
  office is that way.

04:00.473 --> 04:03.109
  I know. But when a father
  comes to school,
  it's important.

04:03.143 --> 04:04.944
   We've got to find out
   what's going on.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.479
 Let's go to Belding's office.

04:06.513 --> 04:07.881
  Why?

04:08.548 --> 04:11.117
I have a plan.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.919
 I have a meeting
 at 1400 hours.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.721
 I'll get to the point,
 Mr. Belding.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.057
 "1400 hours."
 Now that brings back memories.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.759
 Proud to say I
 served my country
 in the Fighting 55th.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.528
  - 'Nam?
  - Indiana.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.197
National Guard.

04:24.230 --> 04:26.900
 I'll sleep better at night
 knowing that.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.968
Major?

04:37.544 --> 04:40.880
 Mr. Belding, I've been offered
 a transfer to Hawaii,

04:40.914 --> 04:45.251
 and I'm here to
 let you know that
 my son will be going with me.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.787
   What does AC
   think about this?

04:47.821 --> 04:50.657
 I found out this morning,
 I haven't talked to him yet.

04:50.690 --> 04:54.094
 Major... sir, AC has found
 a home here.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.563
   He's a good student,
   a great athlete,

04:56.596 --> 04:58.298
very popular
with the girls.

04:58.331 --> 05:02.035
   He gets almost
   as many whistles
   around the pool as I do.

05:03.803 --> 05:07.073
That's hard to believe.

05:07.107 --> 05:11.745
 Mr. Belding I know my son.
 I know what he wants.

05:11.778 --> 05:14.114
 Belding:
 Could you at least talk to him

05:14.147 --> 05:16.716
 and see how
 he feels about this?

05:16.750 --> 05:20.153
  We've talked about
  going to Hawaii for years.

05:20.186 --> 05:23.089
   But go ahead
   and call him if you want.

05:26.626 --> 05:29.729
  AC Slater, to the principal's
  office, please.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.598
  I'll need AC's transcripts.

05:31.631 --> 05:33.767
   Yes, sir.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.605
 Major, I want you
 to know that I think

05:38.638 --> 05:41.941
   AC is a very bright,
   well-adjusted young man.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.843
  Thank you.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.580
  - Dad.
  - Hi, son.

05:47.614 --> 05:51.918
 I've got great news.
 We finally got
 that chance to go to Hawaii.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.287
 Yeah, Dad.
 That's great.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.855
That doesn't
make you happy?

05:55.889 --> 05:58.958
 Well, I like it here
 in this school, Dad.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.326
 Why?

06:00.360 --> 06:03.063
  Major, what I think
  your son is trying to say,

06:03.096 --> 06:06.900
 is that he's never had
 a principal
 quite like me before.

06:06.933 --> 06:10.603
 Yes, that's true, Mr. Belding.
 You're one of a kind.

06:10.637 --> 06:14.107
Seems to be more here
than I thought.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.809
 Could you excuse us
 for a moment?

06:15.842 --> 06:17.944
 Certainly, sir.
 10-4.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.781
 Same to you.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.317
Sit down, son.

06:24.351 --> 06:27.153
   I thought you wanted
   to go to Hawaii.

06:27.187 --> 06:30.924
   Well I did,
   when we were in Iceland.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.360
   But I have real friends here
   for a change.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.963
  If I had to leave them,
  I'd really miss them, Dad.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.398
 Don't you want to go?

06:38.431 --> 06:40.667
   I don't know what I want.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.670
  All right.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.271
I've got to let my C.O.
know by Friday.

06:45.305 --> 06:48.775
So that gives you four days
to make up your mind.

06:51.311 --> 06:55.081
 I'm sorry you were stuck
 in the file
 cabinet for so long.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.220
   That's all right.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.623
Just paint me blue
and call me a "smurf."

07:03.656 --> 07:06.359
 So what'd you find out
 about Slater?

07:06.393 --> 07:09.329
Well, his father is being
transferred to Hawaii.

07:09.362 --> 07:13.033
Slater has until Friday
to decide if he's going
   to stay or leave.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.834
Slater gets to decide?

07:14.868 --> 07:17.771
Yeah, and you'd better hope
he chooses Hawaii.

07:17.804 --> 07:19.739
 Why?

07:19.773 --> 07:22.809
Zack, look at yourself.

07:22.842 --> 07:24.844
 Before Slater, you were
 the big cheese, the main man,

07:24.878 --> 07:26.880
  - head honcho, top dog...
  - Okay!

07:26.913 --> 07:28.882
   A-number-one,
   king of the hill,
   master of your destiny...

07:28.915 --> 07:31.084
Enough already!

07:33.086 --> 07:36.389
 And worst of all, Kelly's
 stuck on him like crazy glue.

07:36.423 --> 07:39.292
   You better pray he chooses
   Hawaii or you're a dead
   man with Kelly.

07:40.727 --> 07:43.063
  "Dead man"? Hawaii?

07:43.797 --> 07:44.798
Hmmm...

07:44.831 --> 07:47.400
 Zack! No!
 Wait!

07:54.941 --> 07:56.876
Slater's what?

07:56.910 --> 07:59.446
 - He's dying.
 - He's dying?

08:01.514 --> 08:03.350
   Zack, that is ridiculous.

08:03.383 --> 08:07.187
Slater's father met
with Belding yesterday.
I bugged his office.

08:07.220 --> 08:11.091
 - You wouldn't do that.
 - Trust me. He would do that.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.793
  How can Slater be dying?
  He won the wrestling title.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.831
 One last heroic
 burst of strength
 is a symptom of the disease.

08:17.864 --> 08:18.765
 What disease?

08:18.798 --> 08:22.102
 It's called
 "mumbio-quadralation... osis."

08:24.404 --> 08:26.039
 It affects the brain.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.209
   Then I think
   you have it too.

08:29.242 --> 08:34.047
   There's a clinic
   in Hawaii that can
   treat mumbio... whatever,

08:34.047 --> 08:36.383
 but that big brave galoot
 would rather live out

08:36.416 --> 08:38.852
his remaining days
here with his friends.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.488
   We have to find some way
   to get him to go
   to that clinic.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.823
 - How are we going to do that?
 - I don't know.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.226
   Maybe by pretending we don't
   want him around anymore?

08:46.259 --> 08:47.494
   Oh that is crazy.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.462
 Crazy? Well sure, it's crazy.

08:49.496 --> 08:53.566
  But if you care
  about Slater at all,
  you'll treat him like dirt.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.838
  - ( knocking )
  - Come in.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.107
  Mr. Belding?

09:01.141 --> 09:02.809
 Hi, Jessie.
 What can I do for you?

09:02.842 --> 09:05.812
 Did Slater's
 father really come
 to see you yesterday?

09:05.845 --> 09:07.447
- Yes, he did.
- Oh I didn't think so.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.382
 Sorry to bother you.

09:09.416 --> 09:13.219
 - Did you say yes?
 - Afraid so.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.156
 Then it's true
 Slater won't be
 with us much longer?

09:16.189 --> 09:19.426
   Might as well
   kiss him goodbye.
   He's out of here.

09:23.363 --> 09:27.067
 I can't believe this.
 Poor Slater.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.268
 Poor Slater?

09:28.301 --> 09:32.105
Where am I going to find
another star wrestler?

09:32.138 --> 09:35.041
 How can you worry about
 wrestling at a time like this?

09:35.041 --> 09:36.910
 Jessie, life goes on.

09:36.943 --> 09:40.180
 People come and go.
 You win some, you lose some.

09:41.948 --> 09:44.951
Mr. Belding,
that is so insensitive.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.053
  Slater's going
  to a better place.

09:47.053 --> 09:49.923
  We should all be so lucky.

09:52.058 --> 09:54.294
  This is all just so sudden.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.962
It usually is.

09:56.062 --> 09:59.299
   Let's just make his last
   few days with us special.

10:00.500 --> 10:04.004
  Last few days?
  I heard six months.

10:04.037 --> 10:07.107
   No way.
   Two weeks, tops.

10:09.376 --> 10:13.380
My guess is he'll
probably be gone
by the end of the week.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.516
 This whole thing is
 just so unbelievable.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.085
  I know. I thought so too
  until I talked to Belding.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.388
  Well, according
  to the medical book I read,

10:21.421 --> 10:25.025
Slater's not in
any immediate danger
unless symptoms appear.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.292
What symptoms?

10:26.326 --> 10:28.595
   Sneezing, itching,
   loss of memory...

10:28.628 --> 10:30.663
  Shh. Here he comes.

10:32.232 --> 10:35.335
- Hey guys, how's it going?
- Great. How are you?

10:35.368 --> 10:38.338
  - I've been better.
  - ( sobs )

10:41.608 --> 10:43.576
By the way,
where were you?

10:43.610 --> 10:46.212
   You were supposed to meet me
   in the weight
   room last period.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.747
  What are you talking about?

10:47.781 --> 10:51.618
 Oh.
 I guess he... forgot.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.586
  ( sobbing )

10:56.423 --> 10:58.058
What's wrong with them?

10:58.091 --> 11:01.061
 It was "Peel An Onion Day"
 in Home Ec.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.065
You're late.
Do you have the stuff?

11:05.065 --> 11:09.069
 Yep. One deluxe ant farm,
 with five generations of ants.

11:09.069 --> 11:12.272
 All lined up
 according to height.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.307
Okay, let's step on it.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.677
  Zack, never let ants
  hear you say, "Step on it."

11:17.711 --> 11:21.114
  I meant hurry up.
  Now, pour the pepper on me.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.719
- Okay, that's good.
- ( school bell rings )

11:25.752 --> 11:29.122
   Okay, this is study hall.

11:29.155 --> 11:32.525
- Can I borrow a pencil?
- Yeah, sure, Preppie.

11:36.796 --> 11:39.399
   Ah-choo! Ah-choo!

11:40.500 --> 11:43.136
  Oh, he's sneezing.

11:53.313 --> 11:56.549
 ( sneezing )

11:56.583 --> 12:00.720
   Hey! This is study hall,
   not "Soul Train."

12:03.490 --> 12:05.158
 Slater's fading fast.

12:05.191 --> 12:08.328
 We've got to get him to Hawaii
 to save his life!

12:12.799 --> 12:15.468
  The "Treat
  Slater Like Dirt Show"
  is about to begin.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.070
By the time it's over,

12:17.103 --> 12:20.373
  Slater will be in Hawaii
  and Kelly will be all mine.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.443
It's show time.

12:24.411 --> 12:28.314
Hi, Jessie.
It's a great day, huh?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.617
   It's a terrible day.
   You can't even
   breathe the air.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.585
 What are you, stupid?

12:32.619 --> 12:34.587
What are you talking about?
What's wrong?

12:34.621 --> 12:37.257
 You are what's wrong.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.630
  - Hi, Lisa.
  - Don't talk to me.

12:43.663 --> 12:44.764
Why not?

12:44.798 --> 12:47.400
  You're one of those
  dumb jocks.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.437
  You didn't think so yesterday
  when I won my trophy.

12:50.470 --> 12:54.274
 You're a conceited dumb jock.
 Well, that's the worst kind.

12:57.811 --> 13:00.714
  - Hey Slater, how's it going?
  - I'm afraid to say.

13:00.747 --> 13:04.084
Hey,
well don't worry about it.
Everybody has bad days.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.820
 But not everybody has a trophy
 to remind you
 of the good ones.

13:06.853 --> 13:08.722
  That's one thing
  they'll never be
  able to take away from you.

13:08.755 --> 13:11.157
 My trophy!
 Where is it?

13:11.191 --> 13:13.860
  Well, this is disgraceful.

13:13.893 --> 13:16.329
Vandals must have stolen it
and melted it down.

13:16.363 --> 13:20.333
  By now it's probably
  Andre the Giant's shoehorn.

13:20.367 --> 13:23.403
  I can't believe this.
  I hate this school.

13:24.771 --> 13:27.674
There he is.
Places, people.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.709
  Hi, Kelly.

13:29.743 --> 13:32.412
 Wait a second. Are we still on
 for the beach this afternoon?

13:32.445 --> 13:34.314
No way.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.218
- What's wrong with her?
- Oh I don't know.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.719
She just saw you coming in,
then said,

13:39.753 --> 13:43.223
 "Here comes that muscle-bound
 pea brain, Slater."

13:43.256 --> 13:44.624
She said that?

13:44.657 --> 13:47.827
 Hey, would I have the guts
 to make it up?

13:47.861 --> 13:50.230
 What's happening here,
 Screech?

13:50.263 --> 13:52.332
Nobody wants me
around anymore.

13:52.365 --> 13:55.201
Can you blame them,
"Brillo head"?

14:00.540 --> 14:02.676
 Hi, Slater.
 You're looking a little pale.

14:02.709 --> 14:06.346
 I want to tell
 you guys that I have
 the chance to move to Hawaii.

14:06.379 --> 14:09.549
   You're going, right?
   Oops.

14:09.582 --> 14:13.319
 Yeah, that's right. I'm going.
 I'm moving to Hawaii.

14:13.353 --> 14:17.457
   - Oh, yes!
   - And I'm going with him.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.626
   What have I done?

14:23.963 --> 14:26.332
   Why'd you say you were
   coming to Hawaii with me?

14:26.366 --> 14:29.636
  Because I care about you.
  I'm going to ask my parents

14:29.669 --> 14:32.772
if I can stay with my uncle
in Honolulu and
take care of you.

14:32.806 --> 14:35.241
  What do you mean,
  "take care" of me?

14:35.275 --> 14:38.511
I couldn't bear for you
to live the last days of
your life alone.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.979
 What?

14:40.080 --> 14:44.317
   It's all right, Slater.
   Zack told us everything.

14:44.351 --> 14:47.253
  Exactly how much
  did Zack tell you?

14:47.287 --> 14:49.923
He told us all about
your tropical disease.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.892
About the sneezing,
itching, memory lapses.

14:52.926 --> 14:55.295
   Listen...

14:55.328 --> 14:58.798
 I really appreciate your offer
 to come to Hawaii with me.

14:58.832 --> 15:02.402
I can't think of
anyone I'd rather
spend my last days with

15:02.435 --> 15:04.270
  than you... Jessie.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.807
 - Slater, I'm Kelly.
 - Oops. Memory lapse.

15:09.809 --> 15:12.545
   Zack, I've been looking
   all over for you.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.215
- For me?
- I don't want
to go to Hawaii.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.283
 - Zack, you've got to help me.
 - You've got it made.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.219
Kelly's going with you.

15:19.252 --> 15:23.390
 She doesn't care about me.
 I'm just her ticket to Hawaii.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.760
 Zack, I feel so used.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.062
Don't go.
Let Kelly use you here.

15:29.062 --> 15:32.532
It's too late.
I told my father
I wanted to go.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.402
You only get one chance
with the major.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.370
So tell him you changed
your mind.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.373
  I'm afraid.
  I'm not good at those
  things like you are, Zack.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.076
 You're so persuasive.

15:43.076 --> 15:46.579
  Wait a minute. Would you mind
  talking to him for me?
  I'd really...

15:46.613 --> 15:48.715
   Time out.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.918
  Wait a minute.
  Would I talk to his father?

15:56.089 --> 15:58.091
  This is too good
  to be true.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.760
   I mean, if Slater stays,
   Kelly stays.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.362
   Time in.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.730
   Sure, if you think
   it'll make a difference.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.833
   Oh, thanks, Zack.
   It will, it will.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.407
  Are you sure we're not
  overdoing it, son?

16:14.441 --> 16:18.278
 Dad, Zack needs to be taught
 a lesson he'll never forget.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.480
 I want him to think
 he's meeting General Patton.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.416
  Hey, I'll make Patton
  look like a pansy.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.586
   - Everything set?
   - Yeah. Dad...

16:26.619 --> 16:29.522
  Are you sure it's okay
  we're not going to Hawaii?

16:29.556 --> 16:34.060
  Well,
  I was disappointed at first.
  But, if you're happy here,

16:34.094 --> 16:36.863
 I can learn to become
 a Dodger fan.

16:36.896 --> 16:38.398
   ( doorbell rings )

16:38.431 --> 16:41.334
 Well, let's let the enemy in.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.770
  Oh, you forgot
  your bandage, Dad.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.809
Ahem...

16:49.843 --> 16:52.412
  - ( knocking )
  - Come in.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.349
  Mr. Slater?

16:56.383 --> 16:58.551
  It's Major Slater.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.854
   You must be Minor Morris.

17:00.887 --> 17:03.423
 Well, yes Major,
 I'm a minor.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.526
Whatever you say, sir.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.662
   Well,
   what is it you want from me?
   You've got three minutes.

17:09.695 --> 17:13.032
- Ooh, oh, that smarts.
- Are you okay?

17:13.032 --> 17:15.035
 A slight accident
 on the grenade range.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.569
   Brain concussion.
   Nothing serious.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.673
Excuse me
while I call the base.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.775
 ( yells )
 Base!

17:23.042 --> 17:25.345
You've got two minutes.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.113
Well sir... Major sir,

17:27.146 --> 17:30.350
  I don't want your son
  AC to go to Hawaii.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.751
  Why should he stay?

17:31.785 --> 17:34.387
 They stole his trophy,
 cold-shouldered him.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.656
 And a girl named Kelly
 used him.

17:36.690 --> 17:38.391
  Well, that's not
  exactly true, sir.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.493
  - Are you calling me a liar?
  - No!

17:40.527 --> 17:42.462
  Drop!
  Give me 10!

17:42.495 --> 17:46.466
 Two, three... hurry, hurry,
 the Russians are in Burbank!

17:49.769 --> 17:53.940
   Hi.
   I'm Major Slater.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.976
 What is it you wanted
 to talk to me about, soldier?

17:57.077 --> 17:58.545
  Well Major,

17:58.578 --> 18:01.014
  I was the one that made
  everybody cold-shoulder AC.

18:01.014 --> 18:03.616
 I was jealous of his trophy
 and tried to get him to leave.

18:03.650 --> 18:07.487
  Oh, you're the one.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.723
   - What's that?
   - Oh, just a live grenade.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.025
A live grenade?

18:12.058 --> 18:13.693
Do you know
how these work?

18:13.727 --> 18:16.529
 Just pull the pin, like this.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.565
 As long as you hold that clip,
 nothing will happen.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.400
But if you were
to let go of that clip,

18:20.433 --> 18:24.471
  it could blow up everyone
  who did you wrong
  in four seconds.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.741
Three... two...

18:27.774 --> 18:30.543
  - ( Zack shrieking )
  - one...

18:30.577 --> 18:33.179
( softly together )
Boom.

18:35.115 --> 18:38.451
 ( Hawaiian style music plays )

18:38.485 --> 18:41.788
 Max:
 And so we bid goodbye

18:41.821 --> 18:43.790
 to our brave warrior.

18:43.823 --> 18:47.093
 As the sun dips
 into farewell

18:47.127 --> 18:50.697
   we say,
   "Aloha, Slater,"

18:50.730 --> 18:53.199
  as he is welcomed
  to paradise

18:53.233 --> 18:56.770
 by the
 "Pineapple Princess."

19:03.877 --> 19:06.813
My pineapple bra
is killing me.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.883
   Which means,
   let's hula down!

19:09.916 --> 19:12.085
   ( drums playing )

19:25.165 --> 19:27.467
 All:
 Hey!

19:28.835 --> 19:30.870
 Hey!

19:31.905 --> 19:34.040
  Ho!

19:46.820 --> 19:49.189
  - <i>Mona lalla</i>, Lisa.
  - What's that mean?

19:49.222 --> 19:52.258
  "You make my blood bubble
  like hot lava."

19:52.292 --> 19:55.895
Well, <i>mona lalla-lalla</i>...
"Go sit on a volcano."

19:57.797 --> 20:01.101
Here's a going-away gift
from all your friends.

20:01.134 --> 20:03.970
   It's a man-eating plant!

20:04.004 --> 20:05.305
  ( rapid clicking )

20:06.006 --> 20:08.541
 Thanks, Max.

20:08.575 --> 20:11.544
   Hey you guys,
   this is all really nice,

20:11.578 --> 20:13.780
   but I don't
   deserve all this.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.119
  Slater, is that you?

20:19.152 --> 20:20.787
 Hey where'd you get my trophy?

20:20.820 --> 20:22.655
 Oh, it's a surprise.

20:22.689 --> 20:25.291
 I asked Belding
 to have it engraved.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.360
  Aloha, pal.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.062
  Stop him,
  Pineapple Princess.

20:29.095 --> 20:32.799
 His Majesty
 beckons you.

20:32.832 --> 20:36.036
   Hey, you guys,
   I have really great news.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.904
   I'm not
   going to Hawaii.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.707
   But you have to.
   You have a disease.
   You'll die here.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.143
   Hey, I'm healthy.
   I never was sick.

20:43.176 --> 20:45.679
 I just used it
 to get back at Zack.

20:45.712 --> 20:48.748
 You're not sick?
 That is sick!

20:48.782 --> 20:50.050
  You mean
  you're not leaving?

20:50.083 --> 20:52.052
   - You used me?
   - I thought she used you.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.754
  No, I used her to use you
  for you using me.

20:54.788 --> 20:57.157
 Sounds like
 a "used person lot."

20:57.190 --> 20:58.892
  This is the lowest.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.927
   It was only to get
   back at Morris.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.296
 Well you two
 can have each other.

21:03.329 --> 21:04.597
   Come on, Screech.

21:04.631 --> 21:07.200
Compared to these two,
you look good.

21:09.135 --> 21:13.907
 Which means,
 "Thanks for being slimeballs."

21:13.940 --> 21:15.842
 - They'll get over it.
 - You think so?

21:15.875 --> 21:18.745
 I've been putting them through
 this since the first grade

21:18.778 --> 21:19.913
  and I'm still here.

21:19.946 --> 21:23.183
 - You mad I'm staying?
 - Not really.

21:23.216 --> 21:25.785
   There's nobody
   I'd rather beat than you.

21:25.819 --> 21:28.922
 Dream on, Preppie.
 Because right now...

21:30.090 --> 21:31.658
 I'm the king.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.693
  Over my dead body.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.362
 Oh, that reminds me,

21:35.395 --> 21:37.764
   my dad asked me
   to give you this.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.233
Three... two...

21:40.967 --> 21:42.235
one...

21:47.707 --> 21:50.343
 ( instrumental music plays )
