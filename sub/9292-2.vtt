00:14.240 --> 00:16.390
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

00:17.360 --> 00:18.634
I'm your brother.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.790
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.599
- It's all right. Really.
- OK.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.875
One more chapter
and we'll take a break.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.797
David.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.435
Get help!

00:31.920 --> 00:36.391
Whoever did this, I want them dead
or in custody when the Russians get here.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.994
I would ask that you consider postponing
the signing of the treaty.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.150
No. Absolutely not.

00:41.640 --> 00:47.158
I think that David was killed because of
something he was about to tell me.

00:47.240 --> 00:50.994
He said that it concerned national security
and that it involved you.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.075
Is she all right?

00:54.160 --> 00:57.277
No, she's not all right.
She's having another one of her delusions.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.957
- What is this? An interrogation?
- I just don't like being lied to.

01:01.040 --> 01:03.076
No one's lying to you, Derek.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.230
I'm not hungry.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.753
Sorry.

01:07.840 --> 01:10.400
You don't owe me an explanation.

01:10.480 --> 01:13.074
If you had wanted to tell me
about your past, you would have.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.311
Yeah?

01:16.360 --> 01:19.630
Jack, I know this isn't protocol.
Please don't hang up on me. I need your help.

01:19.720 --> 01:23.918
<i>They got Tony and Michelle. She's dead.
Tony's critical. They're gonna kill me,</i>

01:24.000 --> 01:25.399
What are you doing here?

01:25.480 --> 01:28.836
I'm sorry I followed you.
I'm just... I'm just worried about my mother.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.035
You're going with me.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.279
Hold your fire, Chloe!

01:39.640 --> 01:42.200
Palmer was the primary target.

01:43.160 --> 01:46.470
To set you up.
Make it look like you did it.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.393
- You're the one that killed Palmer.
- Yeah.

01:59.080 --> 02:03.471
The president's retreat is vulnerable. You
need to post two more people here at Delta.

02:03.560 --> 02:07.792
- It's a likely point of infiltration.
- I'll pull assets from somewhere else.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.235
- Marcy, hi. Can you give me the figures?
- 167...

02:10.320 --> 02:12.914
- Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.
- What is it, Edgar?

02:13.000 --> 02:17.152
We have a visual on the suspect.
He may be the Palmer shooter.

02:17.240 --> 02:20.949
- Were you able to make an lD?
- I think you should see for yourself.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.998
About an hour before
President Palmer was shot,

02:24.080 --> 02:27.470
someone broke into the building
the sniper used.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.120
We have a frame grab from a security video.

02:30.200 --> 02:35.479
I ran it through a high-res filter,
so it may take a few seconds to render.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.951
Audrey.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.478
What is going on here, Jack?

03:06.560 --> 03:09.711
They're setting me up
for Palmer's assassination.

03:09.800 --> 03:13.509
- Palmer's not even president. Why kill him?
- I don't know.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.909
You need to get
as far away from here as you can.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.231
No, I need to find out
who really killed President Palmer.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.197
How are you gonna do that?

03:21.280 --> 03:24.829
Start at the beginning,
investigate the original crime scene.

03:24.920 --> 03:29.232
David Palmer was visiting his brother. Maybe
he left something there that can help me.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.311
Palmer was killed an hour ago.

03:31.400 --> 03:34.358
The place will be crawling with
Secret Service, FBl, police.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.432
I need schematics
and an interagency deployment grid.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.750
Can you get that for me or not?

03:40.560 --> 03:44.155
Yeah. I should be able
to log on remotely from the site.

03:44.240 --> 03:47.038
OK. Come on. Let's go.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.754
How could you kill that guy?

03:56.320 --> 04:00.029
I'm sorry you had to see that, Derek.
Get in the van.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.031
I'm not going anywhere with you.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.588
You're gonna do exactly what I tell you.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.875
Let go of me!

04:08.600 --> 04:11.114
Let's get something straight, kid.

04:11.200 --> 04:17.594
The only reason you're still conscious is
because I don't wanna carry you. Get in.

04:26.040 --> 04:29.237
<i>Analysis indicates
the video hasn't been doctored.</i>

04:29.320 --> 04:33.518
Jack was in the building the sniper fired
from at the time Palmer was assassinated.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.273
That's impossible.
This whole thing is impossible.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.670
Bill, you were there when Jack was shot.
He had no pulse, no vitals.

04:39.760 --> 04:44.436
And I have no idea how Jack staged his
own death. But I understand his reasons.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.512
He was to be handed to the Chinese
to spend his life in prison.

04:47.600 --> 04:51.195
Yeah, but none of that explains
why Jack would want to kill David Palmer.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.919
I had Curtis pull the phone logs.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.404
Palmer, Tony and Michelle
were all talking to Jack

04:56.489 --> 04:58.391
right before he was
supposedly killed.

04:58.480 --> 05:03.600
Our working theory is that they conspired
to help Jack fake his own death.

05:03.680 --> 05:08.390
Now you're saying that Jack was behind
the attack on Tony and Michelle too?

05:08.480 --> 05:11.313
Why would Jack want to kill
the people who helped him?

05:11.400 --> 05:14.312
He may have stopped trusting them
to keep his secret.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.356
Jack would never murder his friends.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.351
Audrey.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.989
I don't wanna believe Jack did this either.

05:22.080 --> 05:26.073
But right now it's the best explanation
for the evidence we have.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.911
I'm sorry.

05:34.160 --> 05:37.436
- The White House needs to know.
- I'll call the president.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.238
Thanks.

05:39.320 --> 05:40.309
Bill.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.914
What is it, Curtis?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.197
I had Adamson run data recovery
on Tony's phone records.

05:46.280 --> 05:49.431
Chloe was on those calls
with President Palmer and Tony.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.431
Chloe knew Jack was alive?

05:51.520 --> 05:53.033
Apparently.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.395
I called her in an hour ago.
She should be here.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.948
I've been calling her,
but she's not answering.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.713
I wanted to run a locate,
but Spenser talked me out of it.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.553
- If anything happens to her, it's your fault.
- Stop.

06:03.640 --> 06:07.030
Have Adamson track her cell.
We need to get to her before Jack does.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.872
Put out an interagency alert.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.918
Bauer's now the prime suspect
in Palmer's assassination.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.993
Emphasise that he's a former agent and
should be considered extremely dangerous.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.955
Excuse me, sir.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.393
What is it, Walt?

06:27.480 --> 06:30.199
Mrs Logan called again.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.514
I can't keep stalling her
about this Palmer call.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.433
Why would he call my wife
about a national security threat?

06:37.520 --> 06:41.638
That's what she says he wanted to talk to
her about "a matter of national security."

06:41.720 --> 06:45.395
- Maybe if I investigated the phone call.
- Stay focused on the summit.

06:45.480 --> 06:50.679
I am, sir. Which is why we can't risk having
Mrs Logan obsess about this phone call.

06:50.760 --> 06:54.150
Showing her the truth might help her
get on with her responsibilities.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.151
So what are you suggesting?

06:56.240 --> 07:00.995
If Palmer called her yesterday, our office
will have a recording of their conversation.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.958
- Get that for me.
- Yes, sir.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.792
And Walt?

07:06.880 --> 07:09.440
Thank you for doing this.

07:09.520 --> 07:13.877
Mr President,
Audrey Raines is holding on line three,

07:16.880 --> 07:20.077
Ms Raines, President Logan.
You're also on with Walt Cummings.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.550
Sir, CTU has a suspect
in the assassination of President Palmer.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.278
Good.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.396
Who is it?

07:28.280 --> 07:30.191
Ms Raines?

07:32.720 --> 07:35.154
It's Jack Bauer, sir.

07:35.240 --> 07:38.437
- Bauer is dead.
- We've all been living under that assumption.

07:38.520 --> 07:41.080
I don't understand.
What makes you think it's Bauer?

07:41.160 --> 07:44.072
CTU has verified surveillance video
placing Jack Bauer

07:44.160 --> 07:48.199
at the same time in the same building
as the sniper who killed President Palmer.

07:48.280 --> 07:50.475
Audrey, this is Walt Cummings.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.950
Let me get clear on this. Are you saying
that Bauer shot David Palmer?

07:54.040 --> 07:56.076
We're proceeding under that assumption.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.957
Why? For what possible reason?

07:58.040 --> 08:00.429
David Palmer might have known
Bauer was alive,

08:00.520 --> 08:04.991
knowledge he shared with three CTU agents,
all of whom were targeted in the last hour.

08:05.080 --> 08:08.914
He does have a history of insubordination,
irrational behaviour, addiction.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.754
Jack Bauer has a history of
great service to this country.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.796
How does this affect the summit?

08:14.880 --> 08:18.759
We're recommending that you delay
or reschedule until Jack is apprehended.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.832
Ms Raines, you have a suspect. Find him.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.073
Yes, sir.

08:25.360 --> 08:28.636
Sir. President Suvarov
arrives within the hour.

08:28.720 --> 08:32.235
Should we inform his security chief
that he's a potential target?

08:32.320 --> 08:33.434
No.

08:33.520 --> 08:37.832
I want this information limited to those who
are involved in the manhunt for Jack Bauer.

08:37.919 --> 08:40.308
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.750
I found Haas.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.798
- He and his men are all dead.
- How did this happen?

08:52.880 --> 08:56.793
I'm not sure. The last time I spoke to Haas,
he was about to move on Bauer.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.393
Any sign of Bauer now?

08:58.480 --> 09:01.631
No. I'll dispatch a team and track him.
We'll have him in 24 hours.

09:01.720 --> 09:07.033
No. Let CTU find Bauer. Once they have him
in custody, we'll take him out.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.315
Bauer won't impede the operation?

09:09.400 --> 09:11.516
He won't have a chance.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.160
We launch in less than an hour.

09:27.160 --> 09:33.395
Their hardware's military spec.
Fragmentation grenades, percussion grenades.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.516
There's a comm unit we can use.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.875
Who are these people?

09:41.160 --> 09:44.709
- Yeah?
- Frank. Please tell me what's going on.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.998
Diane, I know it's hard, but please try not
to worry. Derek is fine. Where are you now?

09:49.080 --> 09:52.152
I'm about a half-hour outside of LA.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.674
- Just tell me where to meet you.
- I don't know yet.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.479
Head towards the city.
I'll get back to you when I can.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.279
- Can I talk to him?
- Of course. Hold on.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.835
It's your mother. Talk to her.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.472
<i>- Mom?
- Derek?</i>

10:06.560 --> 10:08.118
Are you OK?

10:08.200 --> 10:09.838
- I'm all right.
- Are you sure?

10:09.920 --> 10:12.070
<i>- We're about a block away.
- Who was that?</i>

10:12.160 --> 10:15.197
- Say goodbye to your mother.
- I have to hang up now, Mom.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.919
<i>- Don't worry, I'm fine.
- Derek, I love you.</i>

10:18.000 --> 10:19.638
Yeah, me too.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.757
Give me the phone.
Get to the back of the van.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.273
Go!

10:26.160 --> 10:30.278
While security agencies are remaining
hushed, speculation begins to grow.

10:30.360 --> 10:33.193
We're told that that speculation
will not be addressed

10:33.280 --> 10:36.670
because the government says
security is of utmost importance.

10:36.760 --> 10:39.320
Behind me is the Los Angeles
apartment building

10:39.400 --> 10:43.109
where President Palmer was assassinated
a little more than an hour ago.

10:43.200 --> 10:47.990
- You can also see Americans of all ages...
- Pull up, please.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.991
Credentials?

10:57.080 --> 10:59.435
All right. Go on through.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.636
Let her through.

11:32.160 --> 11:34.196
We're clear.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.793
Come on up front.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.155
Hold the light on the bag.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.317
Can you get a wireless access point?

11:58.400 --> 12:03.872
I'm reading the agents' transponders. I can
track their locations to within three feet.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.236
Jack, there are 167 agents
in and around the location,

12:12.320 --> 12:14.675
25 of them
in Wayne Palmer's apartment alone.

12:14.760 --> 12:20.869
I know. That's why we'd better hope that this
is the last place they're gonna look for me.

12:24.480 --> 12:28.189
Testing, one, two.
Testing, one, two, three. OK.

12:28.280 --> 12:33.513
This is a field ops communication unit.
Just put it in your ear and we're set to go.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.912
Derek, put out the light.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.203
Officer. I live here.
I was told that I needed

12:56.288 --> 12:58.636
to check with one of the
agents to get clearance.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.633
- Can you help with that?
- All right, let me check.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.398
- What...?
- Relax. He's really good at this.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.751
Are you sure he's OK?

13:13.840 --> 13:15.353
Yeah.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.231
I think.

13:37.160 --> 13:40.197
<i>- Chloe, do you copy?
- Yeah.</i>

13:52.560 --> 13:56.075
<i>Wayne Palmer's apartment
is the penthouse.</i>

13:59.320 --> 14:01.390
I'm going up now.

14:05.440 --> 14:09.228
There are four agents waiting at the lobby.
Hold off on going up if you can.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.196
Too late.

14:24.160 --> 14:29.075
<i>At the time of the assassination
and assemble at a secure location.</i>

14:35.280 --> 14:39.956
<i>They need to be confiscated
for frame-by-frame analysis downtown.</i>

15:01.120 --> 15:02.951
<i>I'm entering the apartment.</i>

15:04.080 --> 15:08.232
<i>Most of the agents are in the living room.
That must be where Palmer was shot.</i>

15:08.320 --> 15:13.678
There are two rooms to the north, 15 feet,
probably bedrooms. They're clear. No agents.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.988
This first room is a study.

15:54.080 --> 15:58.312
<i>- Let me know if anyone comes this way.
- Will do, Jack.</i>

15:59.520 --> 16:01.954
You keep calling him Jack.

16:02.040 --> 16:05.396
He told my mother and I his name's Frank.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.071
Who is he really?

16:08.160 --> 16:11.516
Jack Bauer. Until a year and a half ago
he worked for the government.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.955
Is that why we're
where the president was killed?

16:14.040 --> 16:16.918
Please don't ask me any more questions.

16:17.800 --> 16:22.874
Can't you at least tell me why
he had to pretend he was someone else?

16:27.360 --> 16:29.156
Certain people
thought the best way

16:29.241 --> 16:31.751
to cover up their mistakes
was to get rid of Jack.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.637
You mean kill him?

16:33.720 --> 16:34.914
Yes.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.879
Jack gave up everything and everyone
in his life, including his daughter.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.269
He has a daughter?

16:42.200 --> 16:47.354
<i>- I've already told you more than I should've.
- I have a computer in the study booted up.</i>

16:47.440 --> 16:49.556
President Palmer had a user account.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.392
<i>- Is it password secured?
- No.</i>

16:51.480 --> 16:54.517
Only one of the files is encrypted.
That's where we'll look.

16:54.600 --> 16:58.309
Give me the computer's lP address.
I'll upload a decryption program to it.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.389
Hold on.

16:59.480 --> 17:04.998
292.162.12.2.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.875
- Someone's at the door.
- Not according to the deployment grid.

17:17.839 --> 17:22.152
- Do not raise your voice.
- You son of a bitch. You killed my brother.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.834
Mr Palmer, you know I didn't do that.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.912
Any evidence they showed you
against me has been fabricated.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.757
I served your brother for years.
I would have gladly given my life for his.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.274
He was my friend.

17:37.960 --> 17:42.670
The only reason that I am here is to try and
figure out why and how he was assassinated.

17:42.760 --> 17:47.550
- I was hoping to find clues on that computer.
- Why don't you ask Secret Service to help?

17:47.640 --> 17:52.919
I'm being set up. Whoever's behind this
has planted evidence making me the shooter.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.275
It's useless to try
to convince the authorities.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.191
And you think you'll convince me?

17:57.280 --> 17:59.746
If I killed your brother,
why didn't I kill you

17:59.831 --> 18:01.637
when you walked
through the door?

18:01.720 --> 18:05.599
Think about this, Wayne.
Why would I be here?

18:09.240 --> 18:12.277
Please. I need your help.

18:12.880 --> 18:17.510
Jack, how do you expect me to believe you
under these circumstances?

18:21.800 --> 18:24.951
- Take the gun.
- Jack, what are you doing?

18:26.560 --> 18:28.278
Take the gun.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.114
<i>After two terms in the house
and one in the senate.</i>

19:02.200 --> 19:06.159
<i>David Palmer was elected president
with a 60% plurality.</i>

19:06.240 --> 19:08.470
Here you are, Mrs Logan.

19:10.680 --> 19:15.037
David and I first got to know each other
when he was elected to Congress.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.953
He and Charles
never saw eye to eye politically.

19:18.040 --> 19:22.033
David never let that
get in the way of our friendship.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.635
Oh... That picture's
from his inauguration.

19:25.720 --> 19:29.429
At the ball, I was one of the first people
David asked to dance.

19:31.080 --> 19:34.675
- We need a few more minutes with your hair.
- I know. I can do it myself.

19:34.760 --> 19:39.390
- I'm just trying to help.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Evelyn. I know. I'm sorry.

19:40.160 --> 19:43.470
Mrs Logan. May l... have a word?

19:43.560 --> 19:45.551
Of course.

19:47.880 --> 19:51.031
The president asked me
to look into the call from David Palmer.

19:51.120 --> 19:54.396
I was beginning to think
you were ignoring me.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.153
- So when did this call take place?
- Last night.

19:57.240 --> 20:01.438
It woke me up. I had fallen asleep watching
the news, so somewhere between 10 and 11.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.956
I'll have someone pull up the call
from the audio archives.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.589
Walt.

20:08.480 --> 20:11.677
He doesn't believe me, does he? Charles.

20:12.560 --> 20:15.757
He thinks I'm making the whole thing up.

20:16.880 --> 20:20.793
- I wouldn't say that, Mrs Logan.
- Well, of course you wouldn't say it.

20:22.040 --> 20:25.476
- Mrs Logan...
- Walt, you can go now.

20:35.760 --> 20:39.719
Did your brother say or do anything
out of the ordinary before he was shot?

20:39.800 --> 20:42.598
He'd been distracted
ever since he came to Los Angeles.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.558
I finally called him on it this morning.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.278
What'd he say?

20:47.360 --> 20:50.955
He never had the chance
to say anything, Jack.

20:52.320 --> 20:55.198
The decryption's done.
You can open the file.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.669
OK, I'm going into it now.

21:00.800 --> 21:05.237
That's the first chapter of his memoir. It
makes no sense. Why would he encrypt that?

21:05.320 --> 21:07.593
There are print-outs of
it all over the place.

21:07.678 --> 21:09.632
Maybe he hid some
information in it.

21:09.720 --> 21:13.599
We'll compare this to the print-out,
see if he added or changed anything.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.319
I've got one right here.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.794
No...

21:20.920 --> 21:26.199
- You haven't sent the file allocations. Why?
- I need a higher-level access code.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.874
- If you're upset about me and Chloe...
- I don't care.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.918
If you hadn't left her on her own,
maybe she'd be OK now.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.468
Don't you think I know that?

21:37.240 --> 21:40.596
Look, you're just making it harder
for me to do my job.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.834
Use Chloe's access code. JJ72.
You won't get firewalled with it.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.035
Thank you.

21:51.320 --> 21:53.515
SYSTEM ERROR

21:55.400 --> 21:56.594
- Edgar.
- What?

21:56.680 --> 21:59.752
This is weird. I tried logging in
under Chloe's access code.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.274
The system says I'm already signed in.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.112
Let me see.

22:07.320 --> 22:10.312
- Chloe's logged in remotely.
- Are you sure it's her?

22:10.400 --> 22:13.676
Yes. See the way the traffic's
redirected to an external socket?

22:13.760 --> 22:16.513
Even I don't know how to do that.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.750
Then she's alive.

22:28.600 --> 22:29.715
Buchanan.

22:29.800 --> 22:33.429
<i>- Sir, it's Edgar. I think we can find Chloe.
- How?</i>

22:33.520 --> 22:36.830
She's accessing our system to a laptop.
I'm running a locate now.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.718
- What's she using the system to do?
- All I can see from here

22:39.800 --> 22:43.031
is she's tracking Secret Service
and FBl deployments.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.236
The locate came back.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.390
She's at Wayne Palmer's building.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.711
Signal's faint.
She could be in a garage under the building.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.711
Let me know if she changes location.

22:52.800 --> 22:56.236
Why would Chloe be at the scene
of Palmer's murder tracking agents?

22:56.320 --> 22:59.471
She wouldn't be.
Unless someone was forcing her.

22:59.560 --> 23:00.993
What do you mean?

23:01.080 --> 23:03.469
Maybe Jack left evidence he needs to erase.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.028
Surrounded by all those agents?

23:06.120 --> 23:08.236
Jack can explain when we apprehend him.

23:08.320 --> 23:13.519
Bill Buchanan at CTU. I need to speak to
the Secret Service field director immediately.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.951
<i>- Yes?
- Have you left yet?</i>

23:34.040 --> 23:36.395
We were delayed.
We're still loading the truck.

23:36.480 --> 23:40.109
- You should be on your way.
- We'll be there in 20 minutes, as planned.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.760
Call me when you're approaching.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.312
Wait. Stop, stop. Right there. He added
something in the middle of a sentence.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.312
A... a name and an address. There.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.870
Chevensky - 16 Transport Way.
Did you get that? It looks like an address.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.633
Yes. Transport Way is a street
at the Ontario airport.

23:58.720 --> 24:01.996
Check all flights into Ontario.
Look for a passenger Chevensky.

24:02.080 --> 24:04.230
Try and make the connection.

24:04.320 --> 24:08.074
Jack, Secret Service
is changing its deployment.

24:09.760 --> 24:10.954
How?

24:11.040 --> 24:13.235
A lot of agents are moving
into the building.

24:13.320 --> 24:14.992
I'm on my way down.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.911
They know that I'm here.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.437
- Let me help you get out of here, Jack.
- No. You can't risk being connected to me.

24:21.520 --> 24:26.992
And until we know who to trust, you can't tell
anybody what we found. Do you understand?

24:27.080 --> 24:31.039
I'm gonna do everything I can
to find out who did this to your brother.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.190
I'll be in touch.

24:53.040 --> 24:55.031
Chloe, I need another way out of here.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.111
Checking.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.952
Across the hall, through the kitchen.
One agent at the door.

25:01.040 --> 25:03.235
Copy that.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.396
I'm in the elevator. Where are they
concentrating their agents?

25:47.000 --> 25:51.949
They cut off access to my grid. I don't know
where the agents are. They were in the lobby.

25:53.840 --> 25:56.752
I'm getting out on the second floor.

26:20.200 --> 26:22.156
Come on, Jack.

26:27.560 --> 26:31.951
- What'd you get for me on Chevensky?
- He's a baggage supervisor at the airport.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.758
<i>Jack Bauer!</i>

26:33.840 --> 26:35.876
Agent O'Brian!

26:35.960 --> 26:38.793
The perimeter is sealed.
There is no way out.

26:40.320 --> 26:43.790
Step into view with your hands in the air.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.915
We know you're down here.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.834
Step into view with your hands in the air.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.434
<i>We got a visual!</i>

27:00.680 --> 27:03.717
Do not shoot! We need them alive!

27:05.160 --> 27:07.071
No one fire!

27:10.960 --> 27:13.076
Don't fire!

27:19.080 --> 27:21.389
- Do not fire!
- Get out of the vehicle.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.869
Step out of the vehicle.

27:23.960 --> 27:25.996
Check the back. Get the side.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.753
Step to your left. Get down on your knees.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.432
Cuff her.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.158
Open the back.

27:33.720 --> 27:36.280
Bauer's not here. Secure the area.

27:49.680 --> 27:52.399
Get in. Give me my bag.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.471
Come on.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.351
Got it.

28:39.640 --> 28:40.675
Frank?

28:40.760 --> 28:44.389
Yeah, it's me. Listen, Derek is all right.
I just need to know where you are.

28:44.480 --> 28:47.040
I'm, uh, on the 210 at the 10.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.953
OK, I want you to take the 10 east
to the Ontario airport.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.634
Go to the parking lot
in front of the terminal.

28:52.720 --> 28:55.359
I'll meet you on the west side of it.
Understand?

28:55.440 --> 28:57.158
Yeah. Yeah.

28:57.240 --> 28:59.276
Diane, listen to me.

29:00.280 --> 29:03.033
I am so sorry that
I got you involved in this.

29:03.120 --> 29:06.112
But it's gonna be all right.
I'll be there in a few minutes.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.235
OK,

29:07.320 --> 29:09.311
OK, thanks.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.878
This is Agent Jennings.

29:16.960 --> 29:20.953
There's no sign of Jack Bauer yet, but we've
apprehended your agent Chloe O'Brian.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.634
She tried to escape our agents
and leave the building.

29:23.720 --> 29:27.872
- You're telling me she wasn't under duress?
- Not as far as I can tell.

29:28.520 --> 29:29.919
Put her on the phone.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.070
Uncuff her.

29:33.800 --> 29:36.439
Bill Buchanan wants to talk to you.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.395
- Hi.
- Chloe, what the hell's going on?

29:39.480 --> 29:43.268
Jack's being framed to cover up
the real reason Palmer was assassinated.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.113
- Says Jack?
- Says the man who killed Palmer.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.156
I heard his dying confession.

29:48.240 --> 29:51.676
You'll find his body
at the refinery at Variel and Topanga.

29:51.760 --> 29:54.911
Do you have evidence that Palmer's
death is to do with the summit?

29:55.000 --> 29:58.037
- No. Jack's trying to figure that out.
- How? Where is he?

29:59.120 --> 30:01.270
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

30:01.360 --> 30:04.272
I don't think you believe him.
You're trying to arrest him.

30:04.360 --> 30:09.070
Chloe, I'm not gonna ask you again.
I'm ordering you to tell me where Jack is.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.955
I'm sorry.
I'd like to tell you but I can't.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.871
Chloe!

30:16.640 --> 30:19.598
- Sir.
- Bring her back to CTU.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.675
Curtis, take a team to the refinery.

30:23.760 --> 30:28.788
Edgar, make sure Chloe goes into
a holding cell when she gets back.

30:32.640 --> 30:35.313
That woman, Chloe...

30:36.560 --> 30:39.836
she told me some stuff
about what you used to do.

30:43.120 --> 30:45.680
Yeah, well, she shouldn't have.

30:48.800 --> 30:53.271
Why did you have to lie?
Couldn't you have just told us the truth?

30:53.880 --> 30:59.159
First of all, you have to understand I never
thought anything like this could ever happen.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.000
After your mother rented me that room,

31:03.800 --> 31:08.032
I started to remember what it was like
to have a family.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.913
How nice it was.

31:15.840 --> 31:20.197
I started to believe that a guy like me
could actually get a second chance.

31:20.280 --> 31:23.113
I know you don't believe this now...

31:24.760 --> 31:27.149
but I really do care about you.

31:30.840 --> 31:33.229
And I care about your mother.

31:36.440 --> 31:39.432
I hope one day you can understand that.

31:46.520 --> 31:47.919
Charles.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.434
- Evelyn said you wanted to talk to me.
- I do.

31:50.520 --> 31:54.911
Did Walt find the tape of the phone call?
I told him approximately when it took place.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.560
- Why don't we sit down?
- I don't want to sit down.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.392
All right.

32:01.400 --> 32:03.789
Don't be concerned
that there's any connection

32:03.880 --> 32:06.792
between David's death
and the phone call he made to you.

32:06.880 --> 32:10.873
He said it was a matter of national security.
Those were his exact words.

32:10.960 --> 32:15.351
- There's got to be a connection, of course.
- There isn't.

32:15.440 --> 32:18.432
David was killed by
an unstable ex-CTU agent.

32:18.520 --> 32:22.672
This was not a conspiracy, this was
one man acting out some kind of grudge.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.876
Did you hear the call?

32:24.960 --> 32:26.916
Can we just drop this?

32:27.000 --> 32:29.116
Did you or didn't you hear it?

32:39.080 --> 32:43.232
- Hello?
- Martha, it's David Palmer, Did I wake you?

32:43.320 --> 32:46.232
<i>No, no, David.
Not at all, What's going on?</i>

32:46.320 --> 32:50.233
<i>I need to talk to you.
It's hardly a matter of national security,</i>

32:50.320 --> 32:54.233
<i>but I'm hosting a charity dinner next month
for the Art In Action programme.</i>

32:54.320 --> 32:56.766
<i>No. That's not what he
said. No, that's not it.</i>

32:56.851 --> 32:58.438
<i>I would like you to be there.</i>

32:58.520 --> 33:01.910
No, that is not it. That is not it.
Charles, that's not it. Let me...

33:02.000 --> 33:03.752
Martha, listen!

33:03.840 --> 33:06.798
<i>- We'll talk more in the morning, then.
- Thank you.</i>

33:06.880 --> 33:09.189
<i>- Of course.
- Send the president my best.</i>

33:09.280 --> 33:11.316
- No. That's not what he said.
- Y es, it is.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.072
No, that is a trick.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.798
- I am not crazy.
- Listen to me.

33:14.880 --> 33:18.270
- I know what I heard!
- Martha! Martha! Listen to me.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.794
I spoke to Dr Hill.

33:21.360 --> 33:25.876
He said if you are not consistent with your
medication you can become disoriented.

33:25.960 --> 33:29.191
Your memory can be affected.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.958
- He said that?
- Yes.

33:37.720 --> 33:40.837
That's why you remember
something different.

33:40.920 --> 33:44.913
I know you don't like
how these pills make you feel,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.514
but you need to take them.

33:54.120 --> 33:57.430
If Jack was responsible for Palmer's death,
why would Chloe cover him?

33:57.520 --> 34:01.559
It doesn't make sense. There's something
else going on here and we're missing it.

34:01.640 --> 34:05.030
NSA intercepted some chatter
identifying the summit as a target.

34:05.120 --> 34:08.476
We're sourcing it now,
but the reliability's approaching 95%.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.869
- Time frame?
- Within the next 15 minutes.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.428
That's when Suvarov's scheduled to land.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.829
Logan said he won't postpone this summit.

34:15.920 --> 34:19.117
In light of this, he may not have a choice.

34:21.280 --> 34:23.714
<i>- Operations.
- Put me through to Mike Novick.</i>

34:27.920 --> 34:30.639
<i>Suvarov's helicopter
is leaving the air base.</i>

34:30.719 --> 34:33.871
<i>- His arrival at the retreat is on schedule.
- As are we.</i>

34:33.960 --> 34:38.192
We'll go dark now.
No communication until after your strike.

34:38.280 --> 34:41.511
- I will monitor your progress from here.
- Understood.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.351
<i>Udachi.</i>

34:48.199 --> 34:50.235
- Mr President?
- Yeah, Mike, what is it?

34:50.320 --> 34:52.150
CTU has confirmed intelligence

34:52.239 --> 34:56.027
suggesting President Suvarov's helicopter
will be targeted.

34:56.120 --> 35:01.148
- How good is this intelligence?
- Very good. They want you to reschedule.

35:01.240 --> 35:04.869
No. I've told them, I'm telling you.
I will not postpone this summit.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.758
Then at least have Suvarov
alter his arrival plan.

35:07.840 --> 35:11.116
His chopper can land at a different site.
He can come by motorcade.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.156
The risk would be reduced.

35:13.240 --> 35:15.913
And the impact of his arrival
would also be reduced.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.639
The media is waiting
for a landing in five minutes.

35:18.720 --> 35:21.075
- Mr President...
- I don't wanna hear it, Walt.

35:21.160 --> 35:27.235
It's up to Secret Service and the air force
to protect our airspace. Make sure they do it.

35:52.160 --> 35:54.549
There's your mom.

35:54.640 --> 35:56.153
Hey.

35:58.240 --> 36:01.312
I'm sorry about the way
I treated you earlier.

36:02.280 --> 36:04.475
You're a good kid.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.590
Go get your mom.

36:13.520 --> 36:16.114
- Mom?
- My God.

36:18.600 --> 36:19.555
Oh!

36:19.640 --> 36:23.679
Oh, are you OK? I was so worried.

36:30.280 --> 36:32.430
- Things are fine.
- Are you sure?

36:32.520 --> 36:34.511
I'm fine.

36:35.760 --> 36:39.548
You gotta tell me right now
what the hell is going on here, Frank.

36:39.640 --> 36:42.473
My name's not Frank. It's Jack Bauer.

36:43.520 --> 36:47.513
I lied to you.
I lied to you about a lot of things.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.452
And I'll explain
as soon as I can,

36:49.537 --> 36:52.469
but right now you and Derek
need to go to this address.

36:52.560 --> 36:53.603
CTU?

36:53.684 --> 36:55.757
Counter Terrorist Unit.
I used to work there.

36:55.840 --> 37:00.152
You need to ask for a man named
Bill Buchanan. Tell him I sent you.

37:01.240 --> 37:03.231
I'm sorry.

37:04.440 --> 37:07.193
I have to go.

37:07.280 --> 37:10.238
When we get there, what do we tell him?

37:11.520 --> 37:13.909
Tell him the truth.

37:30.560 --> 37:34.997
- Where is the baggage claim supervisor?
- Down that hall, to the left.

37:40.120 --> 37:43.112
DOD is giving us the all clear
on the airspace on the retreat.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.475
<i>Unprecedented levels of security.</i>

37:45.560 --> 37:49.951
<i>The president admits Suvarov was given
an air escort of F-16 fighter jets...</i>

37:50.040 --> 37:54.397
- Any word from our agents on the ground?
- OK. I'm all quiet so far.

37:54.960 --> 37:58.509
If they're going to attack the helicopter,
it's going to be now.

37:58.600 --> 38:01.114
<i>The helicopter touching down now.</i>

38:01.200 --> 38:04.237
<i>It will be only moments
before Presidents Logan and Suvarov</i>

38:04.320 --> 38:06.515
<i>will meet face to face for the first time.</i>

38:06.600 --> 38:09.319
<i>There was speculation
the summit might be postponed</i>

38:09.400 --> 38:11.630
<i>following the death of President Palmer,</i>

38:11.720 --> 38:14.359
<i>but President Logan said the late president</i>

38:14.440 --> 38:18.115
<i>would not have wanted a vital step
towards international cooperation...</i>

38:29.480 --> 38:31.550
Mr President. A pleasure to see you.

38:31.640 --> 38:36.430
<i>President Logan, smiling broadly, extends
a greeting to his Russian counterpart.</i>

38:36.520 --> 38:38.636
Our intel must've been wrong.

38:38.720 --> 38:41.757
<i>Relief that Suvarov
arrived without incident.</i>

38:41.840 --> 38:45.435
<i>The ceremony will be carried live
throughout the world...</i>

39:05.360 --> 39:08.477
- Mom, do you see those men?
- Y eah.

39:10.640 --> 39:13.473
That's where Jack went.

39:18.640 --> 39:22.235
Something's wrong. I have to warn Jack.

39:22.320 --> 39:26.108
Derek, where are you going?
Come back here. Derek, come back here!

39:26.200 --> 39:27.553
Derek!

39:27.640 --> 39:30.473
- Get back in your...
- Come back! I gotta get my son.

39:30.560 --> 39:32.630
Derek! Come back here!

39:32.720 --> 39:36.030
- Please go to your car. Get back in.
- I've gotta get my son! Derek!

40:08.280 --> 40:09.872
Chevensky.

40:10.800 --> 40:15.032
- Why was President Palmer killed?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

40:15.120 --> 40:18.351
You will tell me.
It's just a question of how much it hurts.

40:32.360 --> 40:33.952
No!

41:00.920 --> 41:03.354
Get on the floor! Go!

41:12.160 --> 41:14.151
Quiet!

41:14.360 --> 41:15.952
Quiet!

41:19.600 --> 41:24.754
You will not be harmed as long as
your president complies with our wishes.

41:33.680 --> 41:35.398
Derek!

41:36.760 --> 41:38.273
- Derek!
- Ma'am, stop.

41:38.360 --> 41:43.036
I'm trying to find my son in there!
My son...! I have to get my son!

41:55.120 --> 41:57.714
<i>I have dealt with
the Martha Logan situation.</i>

41:57.800 --> 42:00.155
<i>- She's not going to be a problem?
- No.</i>

42:00.240 --> 42:03.676
<i>I altered the tape of the phone call
before the president heard it.</i>

42:03.760 --> 42:08.436
There's no evidence on my end that Palmer
was trying to warn her about the attack.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.192
Good.

42:10.280 --> 42:12.999
The terminal and the hostages are secure.

42:13.080 --> 42:18.598
It'll only be a matter of time till the
president is notified of the demands.
