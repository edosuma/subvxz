He's doing great at not
following his old lesson plan,

17:43.062 --> 17:44.431
so when he arrives today,

17:44.464 --> 17:46.866
I'm taking him home
to teach it myself.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.601
You know, I understand

17:48.635 --> 17:51.771
why you want him to read those
stories and write those essays.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.806
It's a necessary skill.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.475
I actually was just
reading a student paper

17:55.508 --> 17:57.977
on British culture earlier.

17:58.010 --> 18:01.148
"It is that generational focus
on casual pleasantries

18:01.181 --> 18:02.982
that has influenced the way
people interact

18:03.015 --> 18:04.751
across a myriad
of situations,

18:04.784 --> 18:07.420
no matter what they may confront
in the day ahead."

18:07.454 --> 18:09.789
See, now,
that sounds pretty good.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.492
As a former author,
I would know.

18:12.525 --> 18:13.926
Well, I'm glad
you think so

18:13.960 --> 18:15.928
because Eddie
wrote this.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.630
No. Eddie wrote
his paper on cereal.

18:17.664 --> 18:18.931
"And that concludes
my theory

18:18.965 --> 18:20.633
of how the British phrase
'Cheerio'

18:20.667 --> 18:23.836
inspired the name of
one of my favorite cereals."

18:23.870 --> 18:25.672
He did such a great job

18:25.705 --> 18:28.441
because he wrote about
something he felt excited about.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.410
And that's gonna give him
confidence come test time,

18:30.443 --> 18:31.811

18:31.844 --> 18:34.614
Okay, but that doesn't
explain class in the dark

18:34.647 --> 18:37.484
or saying that college
might not be for everyone.

18:37.517 --> 18:40.287
My goal is for students
to discover their true passion

so they don't find themselves
staring at the ceiling one day,

18:42.889 --> 18:44.557
wondering what they're gonna
do with their lives.

18:46.193 --> 18:48.295
You're right.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.363
It is important
to find your passion.

You're a good teacher,
Mr. Grant.

Eddie is your student.

as they do from me.

We have a pill for this, right?

Maybe a little Fen-Phen?

You are pregnant.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.357
Right.
I was pregnant,

19:17.390 --> 19:19.792
and now I'm asking
for a little Fen-Phen.

an insurance issue?

You won't be needing that,

I realized I'm quite lucky
he's your teacher.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.581
I feel like this is
a trick...or a trap...
