[alarm blaring]

00:10.260 --> 00:11.886
- Signal reestablished.

00:11.928 --> 00:13.722
- Satellites just coming
back online, General.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.056
- Okay, people, we
need answers,

00:15.098 --> 00:16.474
and we need them yesterday.

00:16.516 --> 00:19.477
Do we have any idea who
these kidnappers are, major?

00:19.519 --> 00:20.854
- No, sir.
They scrambled our comms

00:20.895 --> 00:21.896
before we could get a real ID.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.398
- What about a location?

00:23.440 --> 00:24.858
- We dispatched two
recon drones

00:24.899 --> 00:26.317
to try and track them down,
but nothing so far.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.944
- So we don't know
who they are,

00:27.986 --> 00:29.154
where they are,

00:29.195 --> 00:32.157
or what they're planning
to do next?

00:32.198 --> 00:34.034
- No, sir.

00:34.075 --> 00:38.121
- Jesus.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.456
What about MacGruber?

00:41.541 --> 00:44.461
- I'm sorry, sir.
We have to assume the worst.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.297
Sir.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.134
- Barrett.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.845
- Honey,
now is not a good time.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.430
- MacGruber's in trouble.
I can sense it.

00:55.472 --> 00:56.598
I--I know I can help.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.224
- There's nothing
you can do for him.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.435
- Come on, Barrett. I-I-I know
him better than anyone, please.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.479
He was my mentor,
my first husband.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.564
- Victoria.
- I know how he thinks.

01:04.606 --> 01:06.441
I know how he moves.
- Victoria.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.942
- He took both my virginities,
for God sakes.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.986
- Victoria!

01:10.028 --> 01:11.780
He's dead.

01:13.490 --> 01:17.619
- What?
- MacGruber is dead.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.037
I'm sorry.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.747
- Sir.
- Not now, major.

01:20.789 --> 01:24.709
- Sir, the president
is on the line.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.127
- Victoria,
I have to take this.

01:26.169 --> 01:29.255
Please, go home.
Don't worry.

01:29.297 --> 01:30.632
Look, I'm gonna find
whoever did this,

01:30.674 --> 01:32.217
and I'm gonna make them pay.
I promise.

Hello.

Hello.

03:04.559 --> 03:07.145
I know you're out there,
Queeth.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.482
Where are you,
you sack of shit?

03:10.523 --> 03:12.901
- Well, look who's up.

03:12.942 --> 03:18.865
* *

03:18.907 --> 03:21.076
Hello, MacGruber.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.410
Have a bad dream?

03:22.452 --> 03:24.954
- No,
I had a fucking great dream.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.374
Fucked your mom
and dad unprotected,

03:27.415 --> 03:29.584
came in both of them
a bunch of times.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.294
- That sounds pretty wild.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.463
- Oh, it was.
And it was so much better

03:33.505 --> 03:35.423
than the nightmare
you're about to have.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.801
- Tell me about it.
- Oh, gladly.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.136
It'll be a simple
two-step process

03:40.178 --> 03:43.598
in which I get loose
and then do to you exactly

03:43.640 --> 03:46.726
what I did to your folks,
mephorically, of course.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.228
'Cause I wouldn't let my dick

03:48.269 --> 03:52.440
get within 100 calendar feet
of your dirty butthole

03:52.482 --> 03:53.983
- So we're calling that
a dick now?

03:54.025 --> 03:55.902
- Oh, fuck you, Queeth.

03:55.944 --> 03:58.446
You'll pay for what you did
to my family.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.865
- Oh, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.075
- Oh, but you do.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.660
As soon as I get out of here,

04:03.702 --> 04:05.954
I'm gonna skin you
from stem to stern

04:05.995 --> 04:09.958
and leave your bloody carcass
to rot in the noonday sun.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.793
And that's a promise.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.462
- You got me quaking
in my boots.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.506
Oh, where are my manners?

04:16.548 --> 04:18.299
You got some old friends here

04:18.341 --> 04:19.968
who just can't wait
to say hello.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.137

Master Sergeant Lon Vincente,

04:24.681 --> 04:27.976
killed in action May 1, 1998.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.561
- No.

04:29.602 --> 04:34.274
- Sergeant Major Presley Dean,
killed in action May 1, 1998.

04:34.315 --> 04:35.817
- [spits]

04:35.859 --> 04:42.073
- Commander Baker Jaxx,
killed in action May 1, 1998.

04:42.115 --> 04:47.162
Lieutenant Chance Tucker,
killed in action May 1, 1998.

04:47.203 --> 04:48.663
- Been too long.

04:48.705 --> 04:53.877
- Captain Bex Dawson,
killed in action May 1, 1998.

04:53.918 --> 04:57.714
I suspect you're detecting
a bit of a theme here.

04:57.756 --> 05:01.051
- Yeah, you guys are all still
super ugly as shit.

05:02.469 --> 05:06.097
- You know, it feels
just like yesterday

05:06.139 --> 05:08.433
that you left us all for dead

05:08.475 --> 05:11.269
bleeding to death
in the burning-hot savannas

05:11.311 --> 05:13.063
of Burkina Faso.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.691
But it wasn't yesterday,
was it?

05:16.733 --> 05:20.362
No, it was 20 years ago,

05:20.403 --> 05:23.990
20 years of near
constant torture

05:24.032 --> 05:27.035
in a secret prison camp
behind enemy lines.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.996
- I guess that's what happens
to traitors.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.748
- Traitors?

05:32.749 --> 05:35.001
We were American soldiers

05:35.043 --> 05:38.046
putting our asses on the line
for our country.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.090
All we wanted
was our fair share.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.383
Am I right?

05:41.424 --> 05:42.467
[together]
Yes, sir.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.094
- But you wouldn't
let that happen.

05:44.135 --> 05:47.055
- Oh, well, ex-squeeze me if
I had a little problem with you

05:47.097 --> 05:50.308
selling a chemical weapon
to the Russian government.

05:50.350 --> 05:55.397
- We were never going to use
Brimstone, you fucking dolt.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.107
No one was ever gonna die.

05:57.148 --> 06:01.403
But all that time we spent
rotting away in that prison,

06:01.444 --> 06:03.238
we perfected the plan.

06:03.279 --> 06:06.282
And now people will die.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.119
- Looks to me like
you're forgetting one teeny,

06:09.160 --> 06:12.288
tiny, little,
incredibly huge thing.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.915
- Yeah? What is that?

06:13.957 --> 06:16.167
- There's only one person
in the world

06:16.209 --> 06:18.044
who knows where Brimstone is.

06:18.086 --> 06:21.172
And his name rhymes
with fuck you-ber.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.258
And that man or woman--

06:23.299 --> 06:24.759
could be a woman--

06:24.801 --> 06:27.012
hid it in a very safe place.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.848
So looks like you're
shit out of luck, bud,

06:29.889 --> 06:31.766
'cause you're never, ever,

06:31.808 --> 06:33.935
ever, ever, ever gonna--

06:33.977 --> 06:35.395
[case clicks open]
Uh, what's that?

06:35.437 --> 06:38.189
[tense music]

06:38.231 --> 06:39.441
- Brimstone.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.734
- No, it can't be.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.527
- It can, and it is.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.737
- You're lying.

06:43.778 --> 06:46.281
You're tying play me
like a blank CD.

06:46.322 --> 06:49.284
But we all know what happens
to blank CDs.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.870
They get burned.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.247
- Okay.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.791
Well, if this isn't Brimstone,

06:56.833 --> 07:00.295
then why am I gonna kill you
right now?

07:00.337 --> 07:03.423
- You're not, right?

07:03.465 --> 07:07.302
- Perhaps you remember your
old friend, Constantine Bach.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.970
Constantine.

07:09.012 --> 07:13.016
* *

07:13.058 --> 07:14.351
- No.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.311
* *

07:16.353 --> 07:18.563
- Hello, MacGruber.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.023
- But you're dead.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.859
- No, he survived that
explosion at Cunth's compound.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.153
His eyes didn't, however,

07:25.195 --> 07:27.322
which is why he requested
personally

07:27.364 --> 07:29.199
to kill you himself.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.702
I just wish he could see
what he's about to do to you.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.954
* *

07:34.996 --> 07:37.832
Well, we're off to make merry.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.085
- Hey, Queeth, one more thing.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.588
Go fuck yourself.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.675
- Another home run.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.051
Have you been working on these?

07:48.093 --> 07:49.427
- I sure have.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.805
And I don't accept
your compliment.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.182
- Goodbye, MacGruber.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.976
[dramatic music]

07:57.018 --> 07:59.396
Constantine, he's all yours.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.772
- Fuck you!

08:00.814 --> 08:02.399
You won't get away with this!

08:02.440 --> 08:05.860
I'm gonna get outta here,
and I'm gonna stop you!

08:05.902 --> 08:08.405
Fuck you!
- Ready the choppers.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.299
- What is all this crap
we're hauling anyway?

08:28.341 --> 08:29.801
- No idea.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.012
But it's important enough
for me to get an H2 clearance

08:32.053 --> 08:33.430
and miss
my daughter's birthday.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.599
- Oh, that's too bad, man.
How old is she?

08:36.641 --> 08:38.560
- She's 8 going on 18.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.479
- [laughs]

08:41.521 --> 08:44.441
Aw, she's a cute kid.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.650
* *

08:45.692 --> 08:47.986
Gonna need therapy, though.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.530
- Wait, why would you say...

08:50.572 --> 08:54.868
[dramatic music]

08:54.909 --> 08:56.828
- The partridge
is in the pear tree.

08:56.870 --> 08:57.996
- Wonderful.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.082
Tell the reindeer
to turn that sled around.

09:01.124 --> 09:04.044
- Copy that.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.089

* And let us in *

09:17.557 --> 09:18.683
* *

09:18.725 --> 09:19.976
Thanks for coming.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.854
- Your message sounded
pretty urgent.

09:22.896 --> 09:26.608
- Piper, MacGruber's dead!

09:26.649 --> 09:29.819
Ohh, he's dead! Ah!

09:29.861 --> 09:31.029
[phone beeps]

09:31.071 --> 09:32.989
They asked him to do
a suicide mission.

09:33.031 --> 09:36.034
And he RSVP'd, "Yass, queen."

09:36.076 --> 09:37.202
He didn't tell you?

09:38.244 --> 09:39.412
- I didn't let him.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.540
- Ohh.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.417
We used to make love
to this song.

09:44.459 --> 09:45.585
- Mm.

09:45.627 --> 09:46.836
- Me and MacGruber.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.213
- Yeah, I got it.

09:48.254 --> 09:52.258
- Oh, he was such
a giving partner.

09:52.300 --> 09:56.262
He never wanted me
to have to do any of the work.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.639
Sometimes he would even tell me

09:57.681 --> 09:59.724
to not talk
so he could picture something.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.393
- Nice.

10:01.434 --> 10:05.522
- Probably just the two of us
on a hike or swimming at the Y.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.442
We would build
to this crescendo,

10:09.484 --> 10:14.197
and he would generously finish
for the both of us.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.490
And then use the restroom.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.366
- Okay.

10:16.408 --> 10:19.244
- Be in there for a while.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.706
Then he would come,
and in his best

10:22.747 --> 10:27.210
Jim Carry voice he would say,
"Do not go in there."

10:27.252 --> 10:29.254
- Cool.
- He would shake my hand,

10:29.295 --> 10:35.135
ask me to leave,
and then hug me with one arm.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.637
It was pure bliss.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.723
- Yeah, it sounds--yeah.

10:39.764 --> 10:42.017
- * The book of love
will open up *

10:42.058 --> 10:44.686
- Whoo! Come on, Piper.
Let's go.

10:44.728 --> 10:45.812
Let's celebrate.

10:45.854 --> 10:46.938
- Vicki, you don't
have to do this.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.316
- Don't have to what, Piper?
Be happy?

10:50.358 --> 10:54.279
I have a wonderful husband
and a big, glitzy house,

10:54.320 --> 10:55.905
and I don't ever
have to work again.

10:55.947 --> 10:58.575
And no more getting shot at,
and no more risking my life

10:58.616 --> 10:59.909
to save the world.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.954
I have the best job ever now.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.497
I'm a wife.

11:04.539 --> 11:07.208
* *

11:07.250 --> 11:09.002
I'm really happy.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.129
- Ohh.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.631
* *

11:13.673 --> 11:15.508
- He needed us.

11:15.550 --> 11:18.970
He needed us.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.805
- * Baby *

11:20.847 --> 11:24.392
- Okay. Okay, what you need
is some sleep.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.435
- Yeah.

11:25.477 --> 11:26.728
- So let me
take you home, okay?

11:26.770 --> 11:29.939
- Yeah.
- All right.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.691
- What kind of car do you have?

11:31.733 --> 11:34.652
[tense music]

11:34.694 --> 11:35.820
* *

11:35.862 --> 11:36.988
- Ahh!

11:37.030 --> 11:39.240
- Ah, there he is.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.993
* *

11:42.035 --> 11:44.662
Shall we begin?

11:44.704 --> 11:47.665
I made these
especially for you, MacGruber.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.583
- Oh, God.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.169
- And I can't wait to use them.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.712
- Constantine, come on, buddy.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.297
What's the rush, right?

11:54.339 --> 11:57.509
You know, you should grab a few
Molsons and pull up a chair.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.345
I'll just hang here literally.
[chuckles]

12:00.387 --> 12:03.181
But seriously,
let's catch up, huh?

12:03.223 --> 12:07.811
- I've thought about this day
for 11 years.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.021
- I've thought about it too.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.316
'Cause I knew that this would
be the day that you forgave me

12:13.358 --> 12:15.819
for getting your eyes
all blown up to shit.

12:15.860 --> 12:19.531
Look, I got some buds
in the optical industry.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.700
So why don't you let me out
of here,

12:21.741 --> 12:24.077
and we can go get you
a brand-new set of peepers

12:24.119 --> 12:26.329
for those eye stumps of yours,
huh?

12:26.371 --> 12:27.831
Any color you want.

12:27.872 --> 12:31.376
And I promise you
from the bottom of my heart

12:31.418 --> 12:32.836
I will not press charges.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.422
You've done a lot
of very hideous things today

12:35.463 --> 12:38.383
that are illegal, to be honest,
very illegal.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.093
And I will not--
I'll overlook it.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.887
I'll just like,
"Didn't happen."

12:42.929 --> 12:45.223
- Sorry, MacGruber.

12:45.265 --> 12:49.269
Now, what do I want
to start with?

12:50.437 --> 12:53.898
Ah, this will do nicely.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.901
[tense music]

12:56.943 --> 13:03.825
* *

13:03.867 --> 13:08.413
I'm gonna carve you up
like a country ham.

13:08.455 --> 13:12.584
And I'm gonna take it
nice and slow

13:12.625 --> 13:16.463
so you can enjoy
every second of it.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.465
- No, no, no.
Please, don't do this.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.717
This isn't you.
You're better than this.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.636
Be best. Be best.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.432
- How about little music?

13:27.474 --> 13:30.602
It tends to cover
the screaming.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.772
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

13:36.941 --> 13:41.112
Constantine, bud, on your way
to get that music going--

13:41.154 --> 13:42.322
which by the way
I agree

13:42.364 --> 13:44.532
is a great way
to cover up screaming--

13:44.574 --> 13:47.160
could you pop into the other
room and get me a little water,

13:47.202 --> 13:49.788
you know,
sparkling if you got it?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.664
- Nice try, MacGruber.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.083
- Shit.

13:53.124 --> 13:56.044
- You know, after you
blinded me in that explosion,

13:56.086 --> 13:58.338
it took me years to recover.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.798
- [grunting]

13:59.839 --> 14:03.635
The only thing that got me
through was the thought

14:03.677 --> 14:07.972
that one day I'd be able
to deliver to you

14:08.014 --> 14:09.724
as much pain

14:09.766 --> 14:14.437
as you gave me
over the last 11 years.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.565
[twangy version
of "Skip To My Lou" playing]

14:17.607 --> 14:22.404
Not my first choice,
but I'll live.

14:22.445 --> 14:27.409
You on the other hand...

14:27.450 --> 14:31.121
- * Guess who's out
of his restraints *

14:31.162 --> 14:35.041
And I know you can't
see this, but...

14:35.083 --> 14:37.002
- Fuck you too, MacGruber.

14:37.043 --> 14:40.130
- Well, I guess I'm gonna
skedaddle on outta here.

14:40.171 --> 14:42.632
By the way, thanks for leaving
that scalpel right by

14:42.674 --> 14:44.509
where my fucking hands were,

14:44.551 --> 14:46.511
you fucking dumbass.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.388
I mean, that was
the biggest dipshit move,

14:48.430 --> 14:50.682
and I cannot wait
to tell Queeth about it

14:50.724 --> 14:53.268
right before I rip out
his throat

14:53.309 --> 14:56.396
and take a major dump
down his neck.

14:56.438 --> 14:57.731
You know what
that's called, huh?

14:58.648 --> 15:01.693
An upper-necker.
Yeah.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.362
So, well,
guess I should be going.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.781
Great to "see" you.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.325
And yes, that is a dig
at the fact

15:09.367 --> 15:11.369
that you don't have
usable eyes anymore.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.038
Oh, and one more thing.

15:13.079 --> 15:16.624
I am totally pressing charges.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.001
Yeah.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.502
- [chuckles]

15:19.544 --> 15:21.880
- So kiss my fucking butt,

15:21.921 --> 15:25.967
'cause I am officially
outta here.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.594
What the fuck?

15:27.635 --> 15:30.930
- Maybe it's time we even
the playing field.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.438
- Fuck.

15:44.486 --> 15:45.945
- * Baa, baa, black sheep,
have you any wool? *

15:45.987 --> 15:47.280
- Fuck. Fuck.

15:47.322 --> 15:51.034
How the fuck do you
get out of this place? Shit.

15:51.076 --> 15:53.453
- Hey, MacGruber.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.997
I went and got myself
a little toy.

15:57.499 --> 16:00.043
- Holy shit. A fire gun.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.796
- A flamethrower.
- Yeah, a flamethrower.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.422
- You know, the only good thing

16:04.464 --> 16:06.883
about losing
one of your senses?

16:06.925 --> 16:10.011
The other ones
grow much stronger.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.972
You can smell better.

16:13.014 --> 16:15.642
You can hear better.

16:15.684 --> 16:17.143
You can kill better.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.395
- Ahh!

16:18.436 --> 16:21.022
[crickets chirping]

16:21.064 --> 16:23.149
- It's the one with the ducks
on the door.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.777
- Nice.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.573
He's gone, Piper.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.784
He's really gone.

16:32.826 --> 16:33.868
- Mm.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.747
- And he's never,
ever coming back.

16:37.789 --> 16:41.042
- Hey, remember
what he always used to say.

16:41.084 --> 16:44.337
"Never ever say never ever."

16:44.379 --> 16:45.714
- He taught us so much.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.884
He was the smartest man
that ever lived.

16:51.428 --> 16:52.679
- Uh, yeah.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.392
- I bet he's in heaven
right now

16:57.434 --> 17:01.229
fighting for justice
with Gandhi and Lady Di.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.397
- I bet he is.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.983
- You know, like,
if some bad guys got in,

17:05.025 --> 17:07.277
like, they snuck in on, like,
a technicality

17:07.318 --> 17:08.987
and they shouldn't have...
- Right.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.573
- I bet he's punching them
in the face right now...

17:11.614 --> 17:13.616
- Sure.
- Kicking them in the friggin'

17:13.658 --> 17:15.702
butts and ribs
and pulling out their eyes.

17:17.287 --> 17:20.123
[gentle music]

17:20.165 --> 17:24.753
He always wanted to pull out
someone's eyes.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.296
But he didn't get to.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.840
I'm sorry.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.301
I don't mean
to make this all about me.

17:31.343 --> 17:34.387
I know you're hurting too.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.056
- Yeah.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.016
- What do you think he'd be
doing to the bad guys up there?

17:41.936 --> 17:43.229
- All the stuff that you said.

17:43.271 --> 17:49.069
- That's so true.

17:49.110 --> 17:51.237
Thanks, Piper.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.115
- Look, you're gonna
get through this.

17:54.157 --> 17:57.452
I know it's hard,
but just try to remember,

17:57.494 --> 17:58.787
he's in a better place.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.039
- He's in a better place.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.084
Okay.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.969
[exhales]
He's in a better place.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.972
[tense music]

18:18.014 --> 18:21.476
* *

18:47.043 --> 18:49.546
-Our Father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.047
Thy kingdom come;
thy will be done.

have you any wool? *

19:08.148 --> 19:11.317
* Yes sir, yes sir,
three bags full *

19:11.359 --> 19:12.819
- Gotcha!

19:12.861 --> 19:15.739
Those stairs are a dead end,
MacGruber.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.323
You're fucked now.

19:17.365 --> 19:19.325
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

19:19.367 --> 19:21.661
[fire whooshing]

19:21.703 --> 19:23.079
- Fuck, fuck.

19:23.121 --> 19:29.544
* *

19:29.586 --> 19:34.215
MacGruber,
I have a story for ya.

19:34.257 --> 19:37.177
Long ago there was a king

19:37.218 --> 19:42.057
with a very interesting way
of dealing with criminals.

19:42.098 --> 19:46.394
He'd give them a choice
between two doors.

19:46.436 --> 19:50.023
Behind one door
was a hungry lion

19:50.065 --> 19:54.110
who'd immediately tear
the criminal to pieces.

19:54.152 --> 19:57.405
Behind the other door
was a pot of gold.

19:57.447 --> 20:00.784
The criminal just had
to make the right choice.

20:00.825 --> 20:03.745
- What's the play?
What's the fucking play?

20:03.787 --> 20:07.916
- What choice are you
going to make, MacGruber?

20:07.957 --> 20:11.961
Well, unfortunately for you,

20:12.003 --> 20:15.006
in my version of the story,

20:15.048 --> 20:17.676
there's a lion
behind both doors.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.344
And guess what.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.763
It's dinnertime.

20:21.805 --> 20:25.225
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

20:25.266 --> 20:30.814
Ahh! Ahh!

20:31.815 --> 20:34.401
- Now,
that's a spicy meatball.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.194
- [gasps]

20:36.236 --> 20:38.446
[iron rattling]

20:38.488 --> 20:41.116
- Oh, shit.

Shit, shit, shit.

This is where he dies.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.479
So long, MacGruber.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.898
You were one of the good ones.

21:59.527 --> 22:02.822
At ease, soldier.

We'll take it from here.

I won't make it now.

[dramatic musical sting]

23:32.287 --> 23:33.663
Ahh!

in hell together, MacGruber?

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
