Cleveland!
Come on, baby,

00:34.568 --> 00:36.301
we're gonna go
for a ride in the car!

00:36.303 --> 00:37.803
The car?!

00:37.805 --> 00:39.038
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
oh, boy!

00:39.040 --> 00:42.007
(panting)
Going for a ride!

00:42.009 --> 00:43.542
Going in the car!
Riding in the car!

00:43.544 --> 00:45.677
Doctor's appointment?

00:45.679 --> 00:46.879
Doctor's appointment.

00:47.747 --> 00:50.516
Doctor's appointment?

00:50.518 --> 00:51.817
Just a quick checkup.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.819
But he's gonna poke
my booty hole!

00:53.821 --> 00:55.421
You don't know that.
He might not.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.822
Oh, you're right.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.257
Not in these frumpy dad pants.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.725
Boo...

01:02.028 --> 01:04.530
Oh, don't worry,
Cleveland.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.365
You're not scheduled
for an ass jam

01:06.367 --> 01:08.067
for another two months.

01:08.069 --> 01:09.201
You're still gonna do
the Cup 'n' Cough, right?

01:09.203 --> 01:11.770
'Cause this one should
be free.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.506
Wait a minute.
This is from the yogurt place.

01:14.508 --> 01:17.209
Uh! They should
not be doing that!

01:17.211 --> 01:18.577
(laughs)

01:18.579 --> 01:20.245
You're a hoot,
Cleveland.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.581
No, I'm a walrus!

01:22.583 --> 01:25.184
(laughing)

01:25.186 --> 01:29.421
I have literally never seen
anyone do that before!

01:29.423 --> 01:31.957
Oh, you can just put those
back in the jar.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.035
What the hell? I told
Junior to pack me

01:43.037 --> 01:44.570
a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich,

01:44.572 --> 01:46.772
not a... (mumbles):

01:46.774 --> 01:48.474
Try it!

01:48.476 --> 01:50.142
Gah! Oh, man, we gotta put
a bell around your neck.

01:50.144 --> 01:53.245
I decided to try
something new.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.947
I made you
a deconstructed

01:54.949 --> 01:56.949
peanut butter and
jelly sandwich.

01:56.951 --> 02:00.252
Sourdough crostini,
spherified raspberry puree

02:00.254 --> 02:02.221
and Thai peanut foam.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.656
Wait, this is like
that scientific
cooking trend

02:04.658 --> 02:06.992
I saw on the Food Network
when I flew JetBlue

02:06.994 --> 02:09.761

Etta James' funeral!

Sorry for your
loss, but yes.

"Molecular gastronomy."

02:13.567 --> 02:17.736
It combines two of my favorite
things: food and nerd stuff!

02:17.738 --> 02:20.005
(sighs)
Gimme one dem.

02:21.508 --> 02:24.843
Whoa! My taste butts
are loving this!

02:24.845 --> 02:28.013
Fierce-looking
lunch, girl!

02:28.015 --> 02:30.782
I'd pay fab cash to wrap my
lips around those nuggets.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.685
You would, huh?

02:36.456 --> 02:40.659
Finally, a "thcool" lunch for
the "thophithticated" palate!

02:40.661 --> 02:43.095
We're a hit, Junior!

02:43.097 --> 02:47.266
I've never been so happy
to watch other people
eat my food!

02:47.268 --> 02:49.868
Oh...

02:49.870 --> 02:52.504
(truck horn playing
"Mexican Hat Dance")

02:54.374 --> 02:55.541

03:00.447 --> 03:03.882

Get your one dollar
burritos,

03:05.686 --> 03:07.786
quesadillas
and virgin Bud Light Clamatos!

03:07.788 --> 03:11.657
And your first taco is free!

03:11.659 --> 03:12.858
(ranchero music plays)

03:15.495 --> 03:16.562
Yay, cheap Mexican food!

03:16.564 --> 03:18.664

03:18.666 --> 03:20.232

ANNOUNCER (on TV):
We now return to CBS's
hit comedy,

03:27.041 --> 03:29.141
<i>Two-And-A-Half</i>
<i>Broke Man-Girls.</i>

03:29.143 --> 03:30.576
Okay, be honest.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.877
Does this dress make
my balls look fat?

03:31.879 --> 03:32.511
(canned laughter)

03:32.513 --> 03:34.846
No way!

03:34.848 --> 03:36.381
It's giving me
a total boob boner.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.849
(canned laughter)

03:37.851 --> 03:38.750

my period.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.387
(phone rings)

03:42.389 --> 03:44.056
Yeap-yeap?

03:44.058 --> 03:46.091
Hi, Cleveland.
Dr. Fist.

03:46.093 --> 03:48.493
I got the results back
from the urine sample

03:48.495 --> 03:49.895
you left all over
the bathroom.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.330
Hilarious, by the way.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.097
But I'd like you
to come back in

03:52.099 --> 03:53.999
for a few more tests.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.367
Is there
something wrong?

03:55.369 --> 03:57.536
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Of course not.

03:57.538 --> 03:58.604
Everything's fine.
Just get here as fast
as you can.

03:58.606 --> 04:01.173
Okay.

04:09.616 --> 04:11.783
And he's had me back
every day this week

04:11.785 --> 04:14.186
for throat cultures,
biopsies,

04:14.188 --> 04:18.724
organ probes, cheek swab,
nastral swab, weenie swab.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.692
But he won't tell me
what's wrong.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.394
Sounds like he doesn't want

04:22.396 --> 04:25.530
to break the bad news to you
till he's absolutely sure.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.099
Sounds like
you're a goner.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.434
Donna the Bear...

04:29.436 --> 04:31.403
Clevebro,
you're dying.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.138
It's the only
explanation.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.440
I've got to do everything
I ever wanted to do

04:35.442 --> 04:36.908
before it's too late.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.810
<i>Bucket List.</i>
<i>Nicholson. Freeman.</i>

04:38.812 --> 04:40.712
Never saw it.
On my bucket list.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.881
Shut up.
I'll start with something

04:42.883 --> 04:47.586
I've dreamed of doing
as long as I can remember.

04:47.588 --> 04:50.489
Yes, I've always wanted to eat
ice cream for breakfast.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.990
I've been afraid,

04:51.992 --> 04:53.325
'cause Donna said
I'd turn into ice cream.

04:53.327 --> 04:57.195
But at this point,
I'm willing to take that risk.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.639
I'm still a "mamammal."

05:07.641 --> 05:13.111
I can do anything!

05:13.113 --> 05:15.280
So that's it?
Just the ice cream?

05:15.282 --> 05:17.749
Yep. Oh, and I've always
wanted to fight

05:17.751 --> 05:20.452

in an old, dusty town square.

05:26.259 --> 05:29.094
Yah!

against you!

05:35.869 --> 05:37.269
Nup!

05:39.839 --> 05:42.441
Oh, I do love you so.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.042
By the way,

05:44.044 --> 05:46.945
when I was at the bottom
of the pile of Chineses,

05:46.947 --> 05:48.780
I bit one of them right
in the water chestnuts.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.782
I'm telling you,

05:50.784 --> 05:52.684
there's no reason for you
to be biting Orienticles!

05:52.686 --> 05:55.887
Dr. Fist would have told you
if you were dying.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.422
(doorbell rings)

05:59.325 --> 06:01.393
Cleveland, I have bad news.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.862
Ah! I'm dying
or we're canceled!

06:03.864 --> 06:05.230
It's one of them!

06:05.232 --> 06:07.399
Tell me we're
not canceled!

06:07.401 --> 06:08.967
Cleveland, I lied.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.403
You didn't need any
of those appointments.

06:11.405 --> 06:15.707
I just wanted to hang out
with you, because, well...

06:15.709 --> 06:20.011
(sobbing)

06:20.013 --> 06:23.382
I don't have any friends!

06:23.384 --> 06:25.016
So you're telling me

06:25.018 --> 06:26.918
you made me think
I was dying,

06:26.920 --> 06:29.588
causing me to break my arms

06:29.590 --> 06:31.890
and the saltines
I had in my pocket,

06:31.892 --> 06:34.493
all for nothing?!

06:34.495 --> 06:36.828
I know! (sobs)

06:36.830 --> 06:40.065
I felt so guilty when I heard
all of this happened!

06:40.067 --> 06:42.033
Can you ever forgive me?

06:42.035 --> 06:46.471
Heads I will, tails I won't.

07:03.956 --> 07:04.589
Uhp, rolled under the couch.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.025
Tie!

07:07.027 --> 07:08.894
Please forgive me,
Cleveland. (sobbing)

07:08.896 --> 07:11.029
Dr. Fist, why didn't you
just say you wanted

07:11.031 --> 07:13.632
to hang out with Cleveland

07:13.634 --> 07:15.467
instead of making him
think he was dying?

07:15.469 --> 07:18.303
I couldn't ask a patient
to hang out socially.

07:18.305 --> 07:21.640
It's unprofessional.
I'm sorry, Cleveland.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.642
I just thought you were
so much fun.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.878
You know, with that hilarious
walrus impression?

07:26.880 --> 07:29.080
No!

07:29.082 --> 07:30.782
You don't deserve it.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.117
(quietly):
Cleveland, I feel
bad for him.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.719
I mean, look at how
pathetic he is.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.555
Will you be my friend?

07:36.557 --> 07:39.124
Oh, that's not even one
of our cool plants.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.393
Just offer to have a beer
with him sometime.

07:41.395 --> 07:43.328
Fine, fine.

07:43.330 --> 07:46.598
Dr. Fist, perhaps you'd like
to have a beer sometime?

07:46.600 --> 07:49.234
Great! Why don't you come over
to my place Thursday night?

07:49.236 --> 07:51.269
And bring those buddies
of yours, too.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.938
Ed, Calvin and Rick
the Moose?

07:52.940 --> 07:55.640
I was thinking of Holt,
Lester and Tim the Bear.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.342
Oh, the second
tier. Sure.

08:02.415 --> 08:06.151
Yo, Choni!
This is our turf!

08:06.153 --> 08:08.653
Yeah! Nobody wants
your kind here!

08:08.655 --> 08:10.489
And by that I mean
competition

08:10.491 --> 08:11.857
and nothing offensive.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.192
So get the truck out of here!

08:14.194 --> 08:16.495
And by that, I mean get
the (bleep) out of here!

08:16.497 --> 08:18.830
There's an old saying
in my country:

08:18.832 --> 08:22.801
"No way, José."

08:22.803 --> 08:24.503
Well, there's only one
way to respond to this.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.806
By working harder
and providing

08:27.808 --> 08:30.475
an even better product
at a competitive price.

08:30.477 --> 08:33.111
Hard work?
That's for Mexicans.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.514
No, we gonna fix this
the American way.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.115
By calling in a
criminal cousin.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.518
What up, Sherrod.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.319
I got a job for you.

09:18.759 --> 09:22.494

What happened to

09:47.588 --> 09:50.221
Gone, Cleveland. All gone.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.057

09:52.059 --> 09:53.625

Yep, sad.

Super sad.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.073
I don't know it.
(chuckles)

10:08.075 --> 10:10.041
Go ahead, Holt,
remove the elbow joint,

10:10.043 --> 10:13.812
and then we will
light it up and par-tay!

10:13.814 --> 10:15.213
(buzzes)
Damn it!

10:15.215 --> 10:17.549
No, Holt,
we're not playing strip.

10:17.551 --> 10:19.250
<i>You're</i> not.

10:19.252 --> 10:22.587
CLEVELAND:
Yep...

10:22.589 --> 10:25.390
All Night Life-Size Operation
Party, everybody!

10:25.392 --> 10:27.626
(all cheer)

10:27.628 --> 10:31.730
(chuckles)
I never thought I'd be
giving a doctor a shot!

10:31.732 --> 10:33.898
Cleveland, it is
my professional opinion

10:33.900 --> 10:38.470
that you are the funniest
person in the world.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.172
(clanking cowbell sounds)

10:41.174 --> 10:44.943
Rallo! As I live and labor
to breathe.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.145
Yo, Kendra, I'm trying to get
this food truck shut down,

10:47.147 --> 10:49.748
and no judgment here,

10:49.750 --> 10:51.316
but I thought you might have

10:51.318 --> 10:53.184
a few bugs or rodents
in your house?

10:53.186 --> 10:57.255
You came to the right
disgusting place.

10:57.257 --> 11:01.926
We have a large selection
of slugs and night crawlers.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.261
Just got a couple
of new squirrels in.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.997
Oh, here's a diseased raccoon

11:05.999 --> 11:07.699
that might be
a good fit for you.

11:07.701 --> 11:08.767
Well...

11:08.769 --> 11:10.568
(grunts)

11:11.704 --> 11:14.005
What about these ghetto ants?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.306
Sure, cock-a-roaches.

11:15.308 --> 11:19.110
A timeless classic.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.446
Oops, can't sell that one.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.048
He's like a son to me.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.717
Come here, Bernie.

11:25.719 --> 11:28.620
(beeps)

11:28.622 --> 11:30.655
$5.32, please.

11:30.657 --> 11:31.956
Thank you.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.725
Have a blessed day.

11:33.727 --> 11:34.325
(bell dings)

11:34.327 --> 11:36.494
Number 23.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.829
I'll take a pound
and a half

11:37.831 --> 11:39.097
of the
night crawlers.

11:39.999 --> 11:42.500
Hey, Dr. Fist!

11:42.502 --> 11:44.302
Hey, Pete!
Herpes.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.070
(snickering)

11:45.072 --> 11:47.072
Innie nipples.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.340
(laughing)

11:49.342 --> 11:51.042
"Accidentally" sat on

11:51.044 --> 11:52.410
a bottle of
Worcestershire sauce.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.479
(laughing)

11:54.481 --> 11:55.914
It happens.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.850
Ah, it's nice
having friends again.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.218
It's a welcome change

12:00.220 --> 12:01.753
from crying in my
big, lonely house.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.055
Well, we have
a surprise for you.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.256
Get in the car.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.191
You bought me
a new car?

12:06.193 --> 12:09.027
No, get in my car.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.429
Now the real surprise
is gonna seem terrible.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.868
So, uh, where are
we going, Cleveland?

12:16.870 --> 12:19.337
As I tell a lot of pregnant
women during delivery,

12:19.339 --> 12:21.172
you just passed
the Stool.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.775
That's because the surprise
isn't in the Stool.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.443
After you bummed us out

12:25.445 --> 12:27.512
saying how you've lost touch
with everyone,

12:27.514 --> 12:29.781
I put a picture of you
in an e-mail and wrote,

12:29.783 --> 12:31.282
"Do You Know This Guy?"

12:31.284 --> 12:34.018
Then I sent it
to the entire Internet,

12:34.020 --> 12:36.688
with the subject
"Lindsay Lohan autopsy photo."

12:36.690 --> 12:40.258
You... put my picture
on the Internet?

12:40.260 --> 12:43.962
Yep, and I heard back from
a group of your old friends,

12:43.964 --> 12:45.864
and we arranged
a little get-together

12:45.866 --> 12:48.900
at the nicest restaurant
that allows bears!

12:48.902 --> 12:50.769
What?

12:52.138 --> 12:54.706
No, no, no,
those...

12:54.708 --> 12:56.141
tho-those people aren't
my friends, Cleveland!

12:56.143 --> 12:58.610
They're the Mob!

12:58.612 --> 13:00.612
And they want
me dead!

13:01.747 --> 13:03.748
(tires squealing)

13:03.750 --> 13:05.049
Whoa!

13:05.051 --> 13:06.484
These things go backwards?

13:06.486 --> 13:09.487
<i>Game-changer!</i>
<i>(tires squealing)</i>

13:16.295 --> 13:18.229
Cleveland,
how could you

13:18.231 --> 13:19.898
tell them
where I was?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.399
No, you know what?

13:21.401 --> 13:24.803
It's my fault for thinking
I could have friends.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.272
ALL:
Why?
(sighs)

13:27.274 --> 13:30.408
Fine, I'll tell you
the whole story.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.442
First of all,
"Chip Fist"

13:31.444 --> 13:34.679
is not my
real name.

13:34.681 --> 13:37.649
My name is
GreenJarvus Ben-Ellis.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.684
I once had a thriving
private practice

13:39.686 --> 13:41.619
<i>on Manhattan's</i>
<i>Upper East Side.</i>

13:41.621 --> 13:43.354
<i>One night, I was eating</i>

13:43.356 --> 13:45.757
<i>at New York City's</i>
<i>Italian restaurant</i>

13:45.759 --> 13:47.592
<i>when I was approached</i>
<i>by a couple of--</i>

13:47.594 --> 13:51.296
<i>for lack of a better word--</i>
<i>"goombahs."</i>

13:51.298 --> 13:53.765
<i>Seeing my lab coat,</i>
<i>which I always wear</i>

13:53.767 --> 13:55.500
<i>to let people know</i>
<i>I am a doctor,</i>

13:55.502 --> 13:58.336
<i>they took me to a room</i>
<i>in the back.</i>

13:58.338 --> 14:00.638
<i>One of their associates had</i>

14:00.640 --> 14:01.806
<i>multiple stab wounds in his</i>

14:01.808 --> 14:03.274
<i>greasy, hairy midsection,</i>

14:03.276 --> 14:05.777
<i>and needed medical attention.</i>

14:05.779 --> 14:08.980
<i>Before I knew it,</i>
<i>I was the exclusive doctor</i>

14:08.982 --> 14:09.514
<i>to the New York Mafia.</i>

14:09.516 --> 14:12.684
(slurping)

14:12.686 --> 14:14.953
<i>It was high-paying,</i>
<i>steady work,</i>

14:14.955 --> 14:17.121
<i>mostly quadruple bypasses</i>
<i>for the mobsters,</i>

14:17.123 --> 14:19.557
<i>and boob jobs for their</i>
<i>fat meatball daughters.</i>

14:22.161 --> 14:24.629
But soon thereafter,
I said to myself,

14:24.631 --> 14:27.198
"GreenJarvus,
you're a Ben-Ellis.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.633
"You're better than this.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.702
Get out while you still can."

14:30.704 --> 14:33.371
<i>As luck would have it,</i>

14:33.373 --> 14:35.139
<i>the night before</i>
<i>I was to perform</i>

14:35.141 --> 14:38.142
<i>an aortic decheesification</i>
<i>on the Mafia Don,</i>

14:38.144 --> 14:41.179
<i>I was approached</i>
<i>by a couple of FBI agents.</i>

14:41.181 --> 14:42.714
<i>They said if I agreed to</i>

14:42.716 --> 14:45.316
<i>anesthetize the Godfather</i>
<i>into a temporary coma</i>

14:45.318 --> 14:47.218
<i>so they'd have time</i>
<i>to arrest him,</i>

14:47.220 --> 14:49.554
<i>they'd put me</i>
<i>into Witness Relocation,</i>

14:49.556 --> 14:50.889
<i>and I could start a new life.</i>

14:50.891 --> 14:52.757
<i>The end.</i>

14:52.759 --> 14:54.225
Wow!

14:54.227 --> 14:55.593
Hey, we lost 'em!
Pull in the Stool!

14:58.063 --> 14:59.597
You're welcome
to lay low

14:59.599 --> 15:00.331
as long as
you need.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.667
And remember,

15:02.669 --> 15:03.768
all the
decorative guns

15:03.770 --> 15:05.069
on the wall
are loaded.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.105
As is a
random urinal.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.172
(toilet flushes, gunshot)
MURRAY:
Ow!

15:08.174 --> 15:10.408
Damn it, Gus!

15:10.410 --> 15:11.676
Ha! Sorry, friend!

15:11.678 --> 15:14.879
Oh, there
you are.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.281
You wouldn't happen
to know anything

15:16.283 --> 15:19.384
about a health inspector
finding hundreds

15:19.386 --> 15:20.018
of <i>cucarachas</i>
<i>in my truck?</i>

15:20.020 --> 15:22.120
What?!

15:22.122 --> 15:23.554
Congratulations,

15:23.556 --> 15:25.023
your little trick worked.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.859
They took away
my food service license--

15:27.861 --> 15:30.862
and not just for my truck,
but for my restaurant, too!

15:30.864 --> 15:33.097
But I swear, I had
nothing to do with...

15:33.099 --> 15:34.732
How could
you do this?

15:34.734 --> 15:39.037
And only five months
before Cinco de Mayo!

15:39.039 --> 15:40.605
Poor Choni.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.373
That is indeed
an unfortunate
development.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.042
Rallo!

15:44.044 --> 15:45.944
Did you plant those
roaches in her truck?

15:45.946 --> 15:47.645
And called the
health inspector,

15:47.647 --> 15:48.947
and saved our business.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.582
I didn't want
to play dirty.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.284
I had no choice!

15:53.286 --> 15:55.286
This might just
be a food truck

15:55.288 --> 15:57.055
to you, but
it's all...

15:57.057 --> 15:58.790
I've... got!

15:58.792 --> 16:02.393
You're gonna fix this
or I'm telling everybody!

16:02.395 --> 16:06.264
I am this close to calling
<i>The New York Times!</i>

16:06.266 --> 16:08.099
Fine.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.467
But one day,

16:09.469 --> 16:12.737
I'm gonna be
bigger than you.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.339
Cut! Good job,
you guys!

16:14.341 --> 16:17.008
Darryl, can you play that
last one back for me?

16:17.010 --> 16:20.645
RALLO:...I'm gonna
be bigger than you.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.146
That was a little
too big, right?

16:22.148 --> 16:25.016
Nope. This... is "dramma."

16:25.018 --> 16:25.817
Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:25.819 --> 16:27.819
I'm in the next scene.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.988
Jit'ry...
jit'ry...

16:31.757 --> 16:34.325
Man, I'm
all jit'ry.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.693
Let me try
one of those.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.830
I don't have a light.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.198
No, I got it.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.166
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:42.168 --> 16:43.701
Yo, driver man,
you got a light

16:43.703 --> 16:44.969
for me and my buddy?

16:44.971 --> 16:48.206
We're hiding
from the Mob.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.042
Oh, no!
They found us!

16:51.044 --> 16:54.946
Well, well, well,
Dr. Snitch.

16:54.948 --> 16:55.646
Say your prayers.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.215
(glass breaking)

16:57.217 --> 16:58.883
Not so fast!

16:58.885 --> 17:01.285
Cleveland?
Don't be crazy!

17:01.287 --> 17:02.653
There's three of them
and one of you!

17:02.655 --> 17:04.188
No.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.991
There's four of us
and one of you.

17:06.993 --> 17:10.361
Good-bye, Dr. Snitch.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.196
Cleveland!
Holy (bleep)!

17:12.198 --> 17:13.798
What the
fazool?
Shut up!

17:13.800 --> 17:15.133
All of youses!

17:15.135 --> 17:16.734
He lied to me.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.803
Made me think
I was gonna die.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.005
Well, he's the one
that was gonna die.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.673
Because seven days ago,

17:22.675 --> 17:23.741
he saw the ring.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.878
Get it? Prostate exam?
(chuckles)

17:26.880 --> 17:28.513
Figures you wouldn't laugh.

17:28.515 --> 17:29.981
That's why I called you.

17:29.983 --> 17:33.084
I needed someone
to seriously kill him.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.585
But you blew it!

17:34.587 --> 17:37.155
Taking that again.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.756
But you blew it.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.525
Darryl, mark the second one.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.527
Look, we don't want
no trouble, man.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.195
That ain't fake.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.998
You're one tough
African-Italian-American.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.833
Thank you for
saying it correctly.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.568
Now get
out of here

17:50.570 --> 17:52.470
before I show
you the ring!

17:54.406 --> 17:56.607
Cleveland, what have you did?

17:56.609 --> 17:59.243
Don't worry, guys,
Dr. Fist is fine.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.945
He and I planned this
in case they found us.

18:00.947 --> 18:03.448
He told me where
to shoot him

18:03.450 --> 18:05.683
in order to miss all
of his vital organs.

18:05.685 --> 18:06.884
It was either
two inches

18:06.886 --> 18:08.252
to the left
of the heart,

18:08.254 --> 18:09.887
or two inches
to the right.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.290
Couldn't remember,
so I split the difference.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.460
Dr. Fist?

18:15.462 --> 18:16.928
GreenJarvus?

18:17.763 --> 18:19.130
Uh-oh.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.531
Uh, Holt, would
you mind putting

18:20.533 --> 18:21.866
your fingerprints
all over this gun?

18:21.868 --> 18:22.967
On it.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.869
Dummy.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.704
Thanks for coming back

18:26.706 --> 18:29.607
so we can clear up
this silly misunderstanding.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.810
See, what you thought was
a cockroach infestation

18:32.812 --> 18:35.379
was actually the
latest cooking trend.

18:35.381 --> 18:36.714
Oh, I heard trends
are all the rage.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.149
Go on.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.550
See, you've got your
Peruvian Browns,

18:39.552 --> 18:41.786
nice and mellow,

18:41.788 --> 18:43.721
German Darks, a tad smoky,

18:43.723 --> 18:45.056
with a nutty finish.

18:45.058 --> 18:46.891
Look, son,
I know cockroaches.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.326
I was on
<i>Fear Factor.</i>

18:48.328 --> 18:49.727
But you've never seen someone
eat a cockroach

18:49.729 --> 18:51.996
that was prepared properly.

18:51.998 --> 18:52.964
Hmm?

19:01.573 --> 19:03.574
Flash-frozen
in nitrogen,

19:03.576 --> 19:05.977
and served with
a basil pesto foam.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.178
It's called molecular ga...

19:07.180 --> 19:07.912
Molecular
gastronomy,

19:07.914 --> 19:08.913
yeah, I knew that.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.482
So you're going to eat that?

19:11.484 --> 19:12.683
Uh, no.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.986
My partner Rallo is.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.521
What?
You know,

19:16.523 --> 19:17.622
to show the health inspector

19:17.624 --> 19:18.523
you love Choni's food.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.725
Uh...

19:21.960 --> 19:23.528
(crunching)

19:23.530 --> 19:24.595
(gulps)
Uh...

19:24.597 --> 19:25.796
Well,
I'm convinced.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.265
You're back in business.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.534
That's what I'm
<i>hablar-ing</i> about!

19:29.536 --> 19:31.469
Ha! Spanish.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.137
Everybody
<i>bailar!</i>

19:33.139 --> 19:35.606
♪

19:37.609 --> 19:40.311
We're losing him!

19:40.313 --> 19:41.546
(moans)

19:41.548 --> 19:43.214
We gotta get
that bullet out.

19:43.216 --> 19:44.715
But we ain't
no doctors.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.017
Wait a minute,
we don't need to be.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.518
Put him on
the table.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.520
Gus, I need a pair
of cocktail tongs

19:49.522 --> 19:52.990
and the biggest Maraschino
cherry you've got!

19:52.992 --> 19:54.058
You got it.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.826
somebody give
him a moe haircut.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.095
I've got my body groomer.

20:00.566 --> 20:01.832
Why'd you do that?

20:01.834 --> 20:04.569
So that he looks like...

20:05.337 --> 20:07.538
The Operation guy!

20:07.540 --> 20:09.173
Exactly.

20:09.175 --> 20:13.377
May Milton Bradley
guide my hands.

20:15.747 --> 20:17.515
To Dr. Fist,

20:17.517 --> 20:19.150
who's as good
as new.
(grunts)

20:19.152 --> 20:20.685
So, now that
those mafiosos

20:20.687 --> 20:22.420
think you're dead,
I guess you can go back

20:22.422 --> 20:25.690
to your life
as a big city doctor.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.692
I can...
but I won't.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.893
I want to stay
here in Stoolbend,

20:28.895 --> 20:31.429
where my
friends are.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.197
People who care
enough about me

20:33.199 --> 20:34.932
to shoot me and save my life.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.267
Hooray!

20:36.269 --> 20:38.169
He's one of,
quote, "the guys"!

20:38.171 --> 20:40.271
ALL:
Hear, hear!

20:40.273 --> 20:43.541
Uh, Cleveland, I wasn't
completely honest

20:43.543 --> 20:45.276
with you about
your test results.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.411
You do have an
aggressive
ingrown hair

20:47.413 --> 20:49.213
that is wrapped
around and

20:49.215 --> 20:51.249
currently strangling
your brain stem.
Ha!

20:51.251 --> 20:54.352
Doc, you're a... (mumbling)
Boise Idaho.
