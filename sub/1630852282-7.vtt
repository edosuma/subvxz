10:55.948 --> 10:59.201
Do you know how hard it is
to not get pregnant in this day and age?

10:59.201 --> 11:01.912
My high school nickname was
"The Comeback Kid."

11:01.912 --> 11:04.331
‐ Why don't we just throw it in the river
and get some pizza?

11:04.331 --> 11:05.541
‐ Good plan.
‐ Agreed.

11:05.541 --> 11:07.876
[loud wailing]

11:09.795 --> 11:11.922
[sighs, then coos]

11:13.841 --> 11:15.259
‐ Damn, that's cute.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.095
‐ [stomach growling]

11:18.095 --> 11:20.556
‐ Ah, Beanie's hungry.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.100
[all munching]

11:23.100 --> 11:26.854
‐ Wow, we're actually great parents!
‐ [chomping]

11:26.854 --> 11:29.481
‐ [Beanie cooing\}
‐ Nah, nah, nah. This is Ruben's pizza.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.900
‐ [Ruben yelling]
Get off!

11:31.900 --> 11:33.569
‐ [pooping loudly]
‐ The fuck‐‐ Get‐‐ off‐‐

11:33.569 --> 11:35.362
Get the fuck off of me!
‐ Holy shit!

11:35.362 --> 11:37.072
‐ [pooping continues]
‐ [both yelling]

11:37.072 --> 11:39.324
‐ [chomping]
‐ [Patrick chuckling]

11:39.324 --> 11:40.742
‐ Have you taken the tour?

11:40.742 --> 11:44.413
They've got an ethically sourced
food co‐op, a‐a windmill power grid,

11:44.413 --> 11:47.374
free childcare center, and don't even
have a word for unemployment.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.668
‐ And they have a vending machine
just for cake.

11:49.668 --> 11:50.460
Mm. [chomps]

11:50.460 --> 11:54.006
‐ Okay. Sire, this place is a utopia.

11:54.006 --> 11:57.050
These ideas could help us
out of our financial crisis back home.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.428
‐ Home? This is my home now, Patrick.

11:59.428 --> 12:01.513
The home with unlimited cake.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.223
‐ I love Nimbus, too.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.977
But we have responsibilities at home.
The people need you.

12:06.977 --> 12:09.938
‐ You go be responsible.
I'll be right here.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.356
Cakin'.
‐ Hello!

12:11.356 --> 12:15.402
I'm not trying to embarrass anybody,
but I must ask.

12:15.402 --> 12:19.072
Did one of you have
explosive diarrhea in the rainbow river?

12:19.072 --> 12:21.575
‐ That's not the toilet?
‐ Oh, no.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.869
That's the source of
all of our drinking water.

12:23.869 --> 12:26.830
‐ Sucks for you.
How about topping me off on this cake?

12:26.830 --> 12:28.999
‐ And there's another thing, my friend.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.418
You've already eaten
a month's worth of cake.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.920
It's meant to be shared.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.380
‐ Shared? [chuckles] But I'm the king.

12:35.380 --> 12:39.009
‐ Weren't you listening during
the elaborate musical number?

12:39.009 --> 12:42.679
This is a republic. Leaders are elected,
and there are strict term limits!

12:42.679 --> 12:45.516
‐ Not anymore. I'm the king now.

12:45.516 --> 12:49.770
Your king demands cake!
‐ ["cake" echoing]

12:50.020 --> 12:51.063
Rah!

12:52.022 --> 12:55.901
‐ [sighs] This always happens
when big people show up.

12:55.901 --> 12:57.778
Gert! Get the harpoons!

12:59.112 --> 13:00.697
‐ Woo!
BOTH: Go, go, go!

13:00.697 --> 13:02.658
‐ Come on, you've got this! You can do it!

13:02.658 --> 13:03.450
Yay!
‐ Yeah!

13:03.450 --> 13:04.952
They grow up so fast.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.620
[Beanie giggling and babbling]

13:06.620 --> 13:09.790
‐ You're doing it, Beanie!
‐ [Beanie laughing]

13:09.790 --> 13:11.458
‐ [bike bell dings]
RUBEN: There's our little star!

13:12.960 --> 13:15.712
‐ Yeah, Beanie!
‐ Holy shit!

13:15.712 --> 13:18.048
‐ Oh, fuckin' awesome!
‐ [whirling]

13:18.048 --> 13:20.175
[both grunting and groaning]

13:20.175 --> 13:21.802
‐ Untie your king!

13:21.802 --> 13:24.471
‐ No, no, no, no.
Destruction of property.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.307
Poisoning the water. Excessive frowning.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.184
These are serious crimes.

13:29.184 --> 13:32.813
‐ But why am I under arrest?
I was an innocent bystander.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.691
‐ Were you? Bystanding is a felony here.

13:43.115 --> 13:46.410
‐ This place sucks. Let's go home.
‐ Now you want to go?

13:46.410 --> 13:49.371
You ran away from your problems
like a child,

13:49.371 --> 13:54.084
and then when we had the chance to leave,
you chose cake, and threw a tantrum.

13:54.084 --> 13:57.254
Destroyed their non‐denominational
faith space,

13:57.254 --> 13:59.214
and shat in their drinking water.

13:59.214 --> 14:02.759
‐ Hey, maybe I'm not their king,
but I'm still <i>your</i> king,

14:02.759 --> 14:04.553
and I command you to get us out of here.

14:04.553 --> 14:08.265
‐ I have been trying to help you all day,

14:08.265 --> 14:09.808
and you keep ignoring me.

14:09.808 --> 14:12.102
‐ Mm. Who said that?

14:12.102 --> 14:14.313
‐ [thunder crashes]
‐ Hear that?

14:14.313 --> 14:17.524
You were mean to your king,
and now God's gonna kill you.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.484
[thunder crashes]

14:19.484 --> 14:22.112
‐ Look. The beanstalk! It kept growing.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.115
[thunder booming]

14:25.115 --> 14:27.367
‐ No song is gonna fix this.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.578
‐ What is it? What's up there?

14:30.287 --> 14:31.788
‐ Giants!

14:33.457 --> 14:37.127
[laughing]

14:37.127 --> 14:40.255
‐ You, there!
This monstrosity's blocking my light!

14:40.255 --> 14:41.715
Chop it down!

14:42.424 --> 14:46.220
‐ This isn't over.
One day I'll get your precious butter.

14:46.220 --> 14:50.349
‐ [sword clanking]
‐ [chopping]

14:50.349 --> 14:53.227
‐ [muffled music through headphones]
‐ Beanie, did you clean your room?

14:53.227 --> 14:54.645
[babbling angrily]

14:54.645 --> 14:57.022
Don't talk back to me,
you fuckin' gremlin!

14:57.022 --> 14:59.775
‐ [whimpering]
‐ Oh. I didn't mean it.

14:59.775 --> 15:02.694
[frustrated crying]

15:02.694 --> 15:04.905
Beanie, I'm sorry!

15:04.905 --> 15:07.574
‐ It's from Kingstown U. Ready?

15:07.574 --> 15:11.912
Beanie... did... not get in! Fuck!

15:11.912 --> 15:13.413
‐ He takes after you.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.998
[thunder crashes]

15:15.874 --> 15:19.628
TYLER THE GIANT:
Fee‐fi‐fo‐fum, bitches!

15:20.295 --> 15:22.631
[yelling]

15:23.715 --> 15:25.175
‐ [thuds]
‐ Ha ha!

15:25.175 --> 15:28.762
[Wispies yelling and chattering]

15:28.762 --> 15:30.347
Spring break!

15:30.347 --> 15:33.100
‐ [pounding]
‐ [grunting]

15:33.100 --> 15:37.271
Uh. I'm done. Let's do some shots!

15:37.271 --> 15:39.690
[gulps]
Aah!

15:39.690 --> 15:42.317
‐ Why did you never mention the giants?

15:42.317 --> 15:44.736
TYLER THE GIANT:
Show me them Wispie titties!

15:44.736 --> 15:46.822
‐ They've been gone for generations.

15:46.822 --> 15:50.450
In olden times, they enslaved us,
but even worse,

15:50.450 --> 15:51.869
they're assholes!

15:51.869 --> 15:55.539
‐ Check out the bling! Wassupppp?

15:55.539 --> 15:58.292
Who wants to get fuckin' faded?

15:58.292 --> 16:00.961
‐ They're always bringing
their guitars to parties

16:00.961 --> 16:03.005
and talking about slammin' puss!

16:03.005 --> 16:05.007
And they all seem to be named Tyler.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.134
We banished them to the clouds above,

16:07.134 --> 16:10.179
but now your beanstalk has given them
a way to return!

16:10.179 --> 16:11.263
[guitar strumming]

16:11.263 --> 16:13.974
Oh, he's got his guitar out!

16:14.433 --> 16:17.686
‐ Oh, great. You got an earring
to go with that shitty tattoo.
‐ [glass shattering]

16:17.686 --> 16:20.189
‐ Is this midlife crisis
ever gonna end, Beanie?

16:20.189 --> 16:22.357
[babbling, hiccupping]

16:22.357 --> 16:23.609
[gulping]

16:23.609 --> 16:25.068
‐ Are you drunk?

16:25.569 --> 16:28.238
‐ [chickens clucking]
‐ You stole a boat?

16:28.238 --> 16:31.700
What's wrong with you?
Where'd you learn to be a boat thief?

16:31.700 --> 16:34.369
‐ How'd you turn into such a pathetic
attention whore?

16:34.369 --> 16:37.122
‐ And how did you become such a lush?

16:37.122 --> 16:39.124
[gulping, grunting]

16:39.625 --> 16:40.959
‐ [Beanie roars]

16:40.959 --> 16:44.379
I learned it from watching you.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.381
‐ [spits]
‐ Is this...

16:46.381 --> 16:48.550
all our fault?

16:48.550 --> 16:50.719
‐ We made Beanie this way.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.430
‐ No, we've been terrible parents.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.766
[distant siren blaring]

16:55.766 --> 16:58.435
‐ [horn honking]
‐ The cops! We've gotta hide Beanie!

16:58.435 --> 17:00.896
‐ You distract them.
I'll sneak Beanie out the back.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.940
‐ Goodbye.

17:02.940 --> 17:04.900
‐ No, no, no, no, no! No, Beanie!

17:04.900 --> 17:06.401
Beanie, no!

17:06.401 --> 17:08.654
[Beanie babbling]

17:08.654 --> 17:10.405
‐ [thudding]
‐ [arrows firing]

17:10.405 --> 17:12.032
[Beanie squealing]

17:12.032 --> 17:13.617
‐ [thuds]
‐ [yells]

17:13.617 --> 17:14.910
ALL:
[yelling] No!

17:14.910 --> 17:16.912
‐ My firstborn!
‐ [all yelling]

17:16.912 --> 17:17.746
‐ Shit!

17:17.746 --> 17:21.708
‐ [chopping]
‐ [grunting]

17:24.044 --> 17:25.504
‐ Ha ha ha ha.

17:25.504 --> 17:27.047
‐ [smashes]
‐ [chomps]

17:27.047 --> 17:28.048
‐ Mm.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.050
‐ But we didn't vote for this!

17:34.596 --> 17:36.265
‐ Trick shot!
[grunts]

17:36.265 --> 17:38.475
‐ [thwacking]
‐ [grunts]

17:38.475 --> 17:40.269
‐ Ha ha! Meant to do that!

17:40.269 --> 17:42.437
[Wispie giggling]

17:42.437 --> 17:44.439
‐ Ha ha ha ha! Watch this!

17:44.439 --> 17:46.233
[yelling]

17:46.233 --> 17:48.068
‐ [thuds]
‐ Crushed it!

17:48.068 --> 17:50.863
‐ Mayor McCloud, cut the ropes!
We can help you!

17:50.863 --> 17:54.116
‐ Freeing you would require
a two‐thirds majority!

17:54.116 --> 17:56.702
And the speaker of the house
just got trick‐shotted!

17:56.702 --> 18:00.038
‐ Okay. The hell with this.
We're playing by king rules now.

18:00.038 --> 18:03.375
Humph. Untie us or I eat the mayor.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.918
[snapping]

18:05.752 --> 18:07.087
MAYOR McCLOUD: Oh!
‐ See, Patrick?

18:07.087 --> 18:09.339
Democracy is a failed experiment.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.508
Now, let's get the fuck out of here.
‐ [Tyler the Giant yelling]

18:11.508 --> 18:14.428
‐ We can't just let them get slaughtered.
We're responsible.

18:14.428 --> 18:16.597
‐ Actually, it's the beans' fault.

18:16.597 --> 18:18.765
[Tyler the Giant grunting]

18:21.977 --> 18:24.855
‐ How about this?
If we take down that giant,

18:24.855 --> 18:28.066
you can take that big‐ass nipple ring.

18:28.066 --> 18:30.152
‐ Ah, I had one of those in high school,

18:30.152 --> 18:32.571
but my girlfriend's headgear
got stuck on it.

18:32.571 --> 18:33.822
‐ Not to wear!

18:33.822 --> 18:35.574
It's solid gold.
‐ [gasps]

18:35.574 --> 18:37.743
PATRICK:
It'll pay your bills for months!

18:37.743 --> 18:40.287
‐ Fine. We'll do it your way.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.082
‐ [Patrick yelling]
‐ [snaps]

18:44.082 --> 18:45.918
Here! Run through his legs.

18:45.918 --> 18:48.212
[both panting]

18:49.171 --> 18:51.965
‐ [Tyler the Giant grunting]

18:51.965 --> 18:54.259
Party foul! Whoa!

18:54.259 --> 18:55.010
‐ [thuds]
‐ [squishing]

18:55.010 --> 18:56.136
[splats]

18:56.136 --> 18:59.348
‐ That might be the worst thing
I've ever seen.

18:59.348 --> 19:01.099
‐ Now gimme that gold.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.018
Yoink!
‐ [squishing]

19:03.018 --> 19:04.728
‐ Nope. That's worse. Ugh.

19:04.728 --> 19:07.064
‐ Uh, I think I'm okay.

19:07.064 --> 19:08.982
I'm getting my second wind.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.275
Boot and rally.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.985
‐ [sawing]
‐ [grunting]

19:11.985 --> 19:13.320
[all cheering]

19:13.320 --> 19:16.156
‐ The good news is we'll feast
on giant meat for weeks,

19:16.156 --> 19:20.285
and the bad news is that beanstalk
still bridges our world to theirs!

19:20.285 --> 19:22.412
[ground rumbling]

19:22.412 --> 19:25.249
‐ Not for much longer.
They're chopping down the beanstalk.

19:25.249 --> 19:27.334
Come on, sire. It's now or never.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.549
[sword hacking]

19:33.549 --> 19:35.801
‐ Broth, wait! Stop chopping!

19:35.801 --> 19:37.803
‐ [cracks]
‐ [Patrick yelling]

19:39.221 --> 19:40.639
Sire, get on!

19:41.098 --> 19:42.724
[both grunting]

19:42.724 --> 19:47.479
[Wispies yelling]

19:47.479 --> 19:50.315
‐ Whoa!
‐ Bazingaaaa!

19:50.315 --> 19:52.568
[all yelling]

19:52.568 --> 19:54.444
‐ Oh, gentlemen.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.905
It has been an honor‐‐
Aah!

19:56.905 --> 20:00.158
[all screaming]

20:00.158 --> 20:01.702
‐ [grunting]
‐ [chopping]

20:01.702 --> 20:02.995
[beanstalk groaning]

20:02.995 --> 20:05.247
[both yelling]

20:06.582 --> 20:08.083
[yelling continues]

20:08.083 --> 20:10.294
‐ [thuds]
‐ [both yelling]

20:12.337 --> 20:14.506
‐ Oh, hey, Patrick.
‐ Sloane!

20:14.506 --> 20:15.924
You're leaving?

20:15.924 --> 20:18.802
‐ What the fuck just happened?

20:18.802 --> 20:20.387
‐ I've saved the kingdom.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.889
[crumbling]

20:21.889 --> 20:24.600
Look at this loot.
It's still got a little nipple on it.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.560
But we're rich.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.728
[clinks]

20:27.728 --> 20:30.189
‐ Once we pay for the catastrophic damage
to the castle,

20:30.189 --> 20:32.024
this should keep us afloat
for a few weeks.

20:32.024 --> 20:34.902
‐ So, the kitchen staff keeps their jobs?

20:34.902 --> 20:38.155
‐ That's a random question, but sure.

20:39.489 --> 20:42.743
[Broth laughing]

20:42.743 --> 20:44.119
