Tonight, for the first time
in my entire life,

00:39.419 --> 00:41.339
I really felt like

00:41.380 --> 00:42.930
I was in control.

a little...

01:36.810 --> 01:38.600
Of course, the seller
wants something.

01:39.313 --> 01:41.103
The buyer wants
something else.

01:41.898 --> 01:43.908
And, sometimes,
there are

01:44.484 --> 01:46.274

desires of their own.

He was in his car

these numbers correctly,

you have, like,
seven minutes, max.

An electrician and a plumber.
But...

05:25.080 --> 05:27.340
one night the electrician
murdered the plumber.

05:27.374 --> 05:29.004
-So, like Cain and Abel
in the Bible.

Anyway, they say
the grandfather clock you have

05:34.965 --> 05:36.845
stopped at that moment. So,

05:37.843 --> 05:39.463
we had to track down
the exact time of death,

05:39.511 --> 05:41.841
find a key that would
work in the clock,

05:41.888 --> 05:44.018
reset it
and then get it running

05:44.057 --> 05:46.307
so that the plumber
could move on, but...

wet cleanup to do in aisle five

06:01.575 --> 06:03.155

we’re good to go.

06:03.201 --> 06:04.661

06:04.703 --> 06:06.243
-Well, now
we sell this place!

06:06.288 --> 06:08.248
-Well, we’re a little worried
’cause our neighbors,

06:08.290 --> 06:10.050
they showed their house nonstop
for six months

06:10.083 --> 06:11.543
before they found a buyer.

06:11.585 --> 06:13.545

it only takes one.

One person to step into a house
and whammo!

Feels like home.

happen that way, though?

06:19.801 --> 06:21.921

See...

06:21.970 --> 06:24.190
I believe the right house
is like a soulmate.

06:24.222 --> 06:26.552
You can look at
a thousand other houses

06:26.600 --> 06:28.770

comes along, you know.

06:29.269 --> 06:30.819
And it’s magic.

07:37.212 --> 07:39.422
-Mm, but it’s
so much money.

07:39.464 --> 07:42.804
-Look, you knock out this wall,
put in a nice big island,

07:42.842 --> 07:45.052
upgrade those appliances,
a backsplash here,

07:45.095 --> 07:46.765
a wine fridge there and...

07:46.805 --> 07:49.805
you can increase
your asking price to this...

07:50.517 --> 07:52.727
But you’ll only be spending...

07:53.603 --> 07:54.893
that.

07:54.938 --> 07:57.648
Your R-O-I is going to be
at least 84%!

07:57.691 --> 07:59.271
Even more
if there’s a bidding war

07:59.317 --> 08:01.697

a farm sink

08:01.736 --> 08:03.236

08:03.279 --> 08:04.949

invading Poland.

08:11.955 --> 08:13.495

08:18.795 --> 08:20.425
These are killing me,
August.

talk with them,
reason with them,

they didn’t feel like it.

So you’re the guy!

There has to be
something more efficient here

37:40.221 --> 37:42.011
[heavy breathing]

37:49.397 --> 37:50.897
-You guys are all so tough

37:50.940 --> 37:52.980
until somebody
torches your goodies.

37:53.735 --> 37:55.315
[gentle score]

37:55.820 --> 37:57.360
[relieved sigh]

37:58.448 --> 38:00.038
-[Susan] Thanks, Deb.

38:00.074 --> 38:02.324
As soon as the kitchen is done,
we hit the market.

38:03.661 --> 38:06.031
Yeah, I spoke
with the contractor. Yeah.

38:06.748 --> 38:08.838
Yeah, I sort of
lit a fire under his ass.

38:09.834 --> 38:11.414
Two weeks.
Great.

38:11.461 --> 38:13.001
’Kay, bye.

38:13.797 --> 38:15.297
-The Cantervilles?

38:15.340 --> 38:17.220
-We’re back on.

38:17.258 --> 38:18.758
-So we are
de-terminated.

38:19.427 --> 38:20.927
Great job on this, Susan.

38:21.846 --> 38:23.516
-Thanks.
-No, I mean...

38:24.682 --> 38:26.602
I screwed up
and you pulled it out.

38:30.939 --> 38:32.529
You really should
take some time.

38:33.691 --> 38:35.231
-Time?

38:35.276 --> 38:36.776
-You could be kicking ass
and closing escrow

38:36.820 --> 38:38.490
almost single-handedly.

38:38.530 --> 38:41.330
Take a few days off!
I got this covered.

38:41.366 --> 38:43.156
[phone buzzing]

38:43.201 --> 38:44.991
-Um...

38:45.036 --> 38:47.746
Yeah. Maybe.
Thanks.

38:47.789 --> 38:49.339
-Hey, Bob.

38:49.374 --> 38:52.204
Ah, yeah. Back at the helm,
steering the ship.

38:52.710 --> 38:55.580
Listen, about this, uh,
Frederico listing,

38:55.630 --> 38:57.600
what’s his
bottom line price?

38:57.632 --> 38:59.212
[brooding score]

39:07.809 --> 39:09.319
[buttons clacking]

39:16.150 --> 39:17.650
-Julie, it’s Susan.

39:18.528 --> 39:21.488
Hey, so I checked out
that bank repo like you asked.

39:23.157 --> 39:24.787
Yeah.

39:24.826 --> 39:27.246
No, it’s okay.
It’s just, um...

39:28.204 --> 39:30.334
It’s just not for you.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.510
Yeah.

39:34.502 --> 39:37.172
N-no, yeah, of course,
we’ll keep on looking.

39:38.339 --> 39:40.349
Okay.
Goodbye.

39:43.344 --> 39:45.304
[phone drops into cradle]

39:45.346 --> 39:46.846
[soft sigh]

39:49.559 --> 39:51.109
[surf in distance]

39:52.395 --> 39:53.935
[gentle score]

40:27.221 --> 40:29.681
-Feels weird coming here
to feel close to you.

40:32.143 --> 40:34.183
Lacks the atmosphere
of Funland.

40:35.063 --> 40:36.983
And the hot dogs
aren’t nearly as good.

40:40.234 --> 40:42.154
Sorry I haven’t
been by in a while.

40:44.447 --> 40:46.157
But I’m, uh,
back at work

40:47.325 --> 40:48.995
and, Dad,
I’m just tearing it up.

40:52.163 --> 40:53.703
Alienated Susan,

40:54.415 --> 40:56.545
best real estate agent
to ever live.

40:56.584 --> 40:58.164
Faced down
a serial killer

40:59.170 --> 41:01.920
armed with nothing
but a stuffed animal

41:01.965 --> 41:04.845
and an epic misunderstanding
of the situation.

41:06.260 --> 41:07.840
Oh, and you’ll like this...

41:10.264 --> 41:11.844
Phil thinks
he found mom.

41:13.601 --> 41:15.261
Yeah.

41:15.311 --> 41:17.021
"For reals" this time.

41:28.449 --> 41:31.119
For as long as I can remember
I wanted to ask her...

41:34.497 --> 41:36.047
Why?

41:40.795 --> 41:42.375
Why’d she leave?

41:44.799 --> 41:46.389
What did we do?

41:49.637 --> 41:51.267
What did I do?

41:51.305 --> 41:52.895
[emotional score]

42:03.526 --> 42:05.906
I really wish that we could
talk about these things.

42:09.407 --> 42:10.957
Hm.

42:14.495 --> 42:15.995
[deep sigh]

42:18.082 --> 42:19.622
Maybe someday.

42:22.170 --> 42:23.760
Maybe not.

42:28.843 --> 42:30.343
Here, Dad.
[emotional exhale]

42:34.348 --> 42:35.848
Nice catch.
