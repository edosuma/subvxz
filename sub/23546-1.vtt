Mohamed Sanaaeldin Shafie

01:25.735 --> 01:29.406
We worked unpaid overtime.
We were building Egypt.

01:29.535 --> 01:31.171
Those days are gone.

01:31.302 --> 01:34.075
The project was completed.

01:34.168 --> 01:39.875
The government sent
people home to raise their kids.

01:39.968 --> 01:42.810
Even Egypt's top officials said so.

01:42.902 --> 01:45.937
Raising your kids is the priority.

01:46.068 --> 01:50.240
Can we really
raise our kids nowadays?

01:50.368 --> 01:55.676
Morally? Intellectually?

01:55.802 --> 01:57.780
Can we honestly do that?

02:22.702 --> 02:26.475
Where the fuck were you?
The cable guy waited for three hours.

02:26.569 --> 02:28.513
Didn't I tell you to wait for him?

02:28.635 --> 02:31.442
I swear to God, boss,
I've been here all day.

02:31.535 --> 02:34.741
The big companies are all the same.
They do nothing.

02:34.869 --> 02:38.005
Saleh,
did I ask you to liberate Jerusalem?

02:38.135 --> 02:40.511
You just had to let him in.

02:40.635 --> 02:44.477
- Absolutely, sir. I understand.
- Understand what?

02:44.569 --> 02:48.604
My cousin can fix it real cheap.

02:48.735 --> 02:51.110
Just get the fucking television fixed.

02:51.235 --> 02:53.770
God willing, drive safely.

03:03.235 --> 03:05.440
Sorry, sir. It's loading.

03:05.569 --> 03:07.944
Here we go.

03:08.068 --> 03:09.569
Look here, Noredin, sir.

03:09.702 --> 03:12.475
You put your interests here.

03:12.569 --> 03:15.876
Reading, writing, football...

03:16.001 --> 03:18.479
You write all your interests here.

03:19.569 --> 03:22.604
And here are your pictures.

03:22.735 --> 03:27.577
Photos you've taken
or ones your friends uploaded.

03:29.068 --> 03:32.910
Here we have your friends.

03:33.035 --> 03:36.911
Look, these are my friends.
All foreigners.

03:37.035 --> 03:38.809
And women, too.

03:39.901 --> 03:43.573
This is the one I'm going to meet.

03:44.702 --> 03:48.510
- She looks like a pink baby elephant.
- I know.

03:48.635 --> 03:52.238
- She just liked my photo.
- She did what?

03:52.335 --> 03:53.506
She gave me a like.

03:53.635 --> 03:57.477
You can like a friend's photo
and they can like yours.

03:57.569 --> 03:59.547
She likes my photo.

04:00.702 --> 04:03.872
All right, Casanova.
Let's work.

04:17.368 --> 04:22.142
- So what did you discuss at Kammal's?
- Nothing.

04:22.235 --> 04:24.509
When will you guys let me in?

04:24.635 --> 04:26.340
Stop nagging.

04:39.834 --> 04:42.869
Good evening, sir.
It's tough out here.

04:42.968 --> 04:44.674
Captain Walid let the Chinese in.

04:44.801 --> 04:47.972
Are you telling us your life story?
Where's what we agreed on?

04:48.068 --> 04:49.512
I swear to God, sir,
business is dead.

04:49.635 --> 04:52.476
Listen, you pay on time.

04:52.569 --> 04:55.547
Absolutely, sir.
I will let the boss know.

05:11.569 --> 05:14.910
- What's the deal with the Chinese?
- Mr Kammal approved it.

05:15.035 --> 05:17.808
Really?
So you're working behind my back?

05:17.901 --> 05:19.845
- No, sir. Never.
- Go!

05:22.968 --> 05:25.105
Sir, please! A quick word.

05:25.201 --> 05:27.201
Sir!

05:27.335 --> 05:29.778
They don't respect us anymore.

06:16.502 --> 06:21.105
Honourable attendees,
I leave you with the commander-in-chief,

06:21.201 --> 06:25.145
President Muhammad Hosni Mubarak.

06:27.901 --> 06:29.879
Thank you.

06:32.701 --> 06:35.872
I congratulate the police

06:36.001 --> 06:41.036
tor capturing the terrorists responsible

06:41.168 --> 06:43.146
for the Alexandria attack.

06:53.868 --> 06:57.403
Egypt celebrates Police Day this year

06:57.535 --> 07:01.740
under a new terrorist attack.

07:03.201 --> 07:08.339
What we just heard
from the interior minister...

07:45.201 --> 07:49.577
I sacrificed everything for you!
I gave you everything!

07:49.701 --> 07:51.872
Keep your voice down.

07:52.001 --> 07:53.502
You fucking bastard!

07:53.634 --> 07:56.078
Just leave!

07:56.168 --> 07:58.146
Get the fuck out of here, asshole!

10:17.634 --> 10:21.442
- Captain!
- I was just checking for any signs of assault.

10:21.534 --> 10:24.172
- Prosecutor.
- Let him have a look.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.976
What brings you here?

10:28.068 --> 10:30.239
Mr Kammal called me.

10:31.634 --> 10:33.112
Where are the lab boys?

10:33.201 --> 10:35.042
Home in their beds.

10:35.168 --> 10:38.441
But... he trusts you with this?

10:41.467 --> 10:44.468
Who covered her face?

11:02.135 --> 11:08.307
- Looks like a professional job.
- No way. It's a crime of passion.

11:08.467 --> 11:11.843
With a woman this beautiful,
you know it's passion.

11:11.901 --> 11:15.606
I've seen this girl somewhere.
She looks like that singer, no?

11:15.734 --> 11:21.701
So you think you're a real detective now?
Go fetch me some coffee!

11:26.068 --> 11:28.841
Did someone order mango
and a plate of shrimp...

11:28.901 --> 11:34.346
Over here, kid. Come!
Give me that.

11:34.501 --> 11:38.809
Charge it on the room, thanks.
Now, leave.

11:40.068 --> 11:41.875
- What? What do you want?
- I'm hungry.

11:42.001 --> 11:43.842
Hungry? Get your own food.

11:43.901 --> 11:46.742
- Get out of here.
- Yes, sir.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.938
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

12:02.068 --> 12:04.046
Welcome, Mr Kammal.

12:04.168 --> 12:06.009
How are you guys doing?

12:06.135 --> 12:08.135
How are you, kid?

12:09.302 --> 12:12.575
- How's your dad?
- He's good. Thanks for the case.

12:12.668 --> 12:18.045
- Found anything?
- It's a professional execution.

12:18.168 --> 12:21.009
I want you to use silk gloves
on this one.

12:21.135 --> 12:24.079
I've been told the circumstances
are very sensitive.

12:25.235 --> 12:30.009
- As you know, sir, certain guests...
- No, I don't know.

12:30.135 --> 12:31.476
Who reserved this room?

12:34.301 --> 12:38.178
Sir, as I said,
it's a special kind of reservation.

12:38.301 --> 12:42.905
- Only the owner knows who pays.
- The owner?

12:42.968 --> 12:44.946
Yes, sir. Mr Shafiq.

12:51.668 --> 12:54.044
Please, sir, take this.

13:00.834 --> 13:05.176
A little compliment from the hotel.

13:16.467 --> 13:18.342
Who discovered the body?

13:18.501 --> 13:22.309
- Housekeeping, sir.
- Bring her to me.

13:22.467 --> 13:24.968
Sorry, sir.
We let her leave early today.

13:25.068 --> 13:27.671
- What's her name?
- Salwa.

13:27.801 --> 13:32.177
We don't have her full name.
She's a Sudanese girl, gets paid daily.

13:32.301 --> 13:33.904
Do you have her address?

13:34.001 --> 13:35.808
She said Arbaa W Nuss.

13:35.901 --> 13:38.879
I'm afraid I don't have an address.

13:38.968 --> 13:40.071
Really?

14:19.200 --> 14:22.077
- Go get the mayor, boy!
- Clinton!

14:24.568 --> 14:28.103
Get over here!
Give me your papers.

14:37.701 --> 14:40.542
- You're the mayor here?
- Yes.

14:40.668 --> 14:44.010
We're looking for a Sudanese girl, Salwa,
works at the Hilton.

14:44.135 --> 14:47.079
- Do you know her?
- Yes.

14:47.167 --> 14:50.044
Get us the girl
and you'll get your papers back.

14:50.167 --> 14:54.135
- But I need my ID.
- Get back inside, boy.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.773
- I'm learning German.
- Very ambitious.

15:06.901 --> 15:10.845
Aiming for
the Horniest Police Officer Award.

15:10.901 --> 15:12.879
You know I am.

15:17.501 --> 15:20.672
- Hello.
- Hello brother, where are you?

15:20.801 --> 15:23.472
- What's up, all good?
- I need you to take care of dad now.

15:23.568 --> 15:25.603
- What?
- It's your fucking turn.

15:25.734 --> 15:28.678
- No, I can't.
- Just do as I say.

15:28.801 --> 15:30.676
Are you asking me
or giving me an order?

15:30.801 --> 15:32.904
- I'm travelling, for God's sake.
- When are you back?

15:32.968 --> 15:35.741
- None of your business.
- You're kidding me?

16:10.668 --> 16:13.044
Dad, I've earned some extra money.

16:13.167 --> 16:15.145
How about we go to the hospital?

16:15.234 --> 16:20.043
Please. Don't say you earned
some "extra" money.

16:20.167 --> 16:24.509
Just say you stole it.

16:24.634 --> 16:26.839
OK, fine.

16:26.901 --> 16:30.038
You can't buy dignity, son.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.645
Goodbye.

16:50.901 --> 16:53.401
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

17:43.167 --> 17:45.167
Got any Lalena CDs?

17:45.301 --> 17:47.609
- Yeah. Your Love is Not Enough?

18:08.167 --> 18:09.338
Evidence.

18:13.868 --> 18:17.869
You've reached Club Solitaire.

18:17.967 --> 18:23.344
If you dance or sing,
please send us a full-body picture.

18:23.501 --> 18:27.206
For other services,
leave your name and number.

18:30.367 --> 18:33.834
You who are travelling alone

18:36.200 --> 18:39.804
You who are travelling alone

18:41.167 --> 18:44.543
And leaving me behind

18:44.668 --> 18:48.339
Why are you leaving me?

18:48.501 --> 18:55.639
Why are you leaving me
and haunting me?

18:55.734 --> 19:03.726
Leave me without saying goodbye

19:04.367 --> 19:12.359
My heart has already fared you well

19:17.534 --> 19:21.478
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

20:47.867 --> 20:54.244
We're building the new Cairo with a
modern vision. - Hatem Shafiq.

21:20.900 --> 21:24.572
We received a complaint.
Some money is missing from a room.

21:24.701 --> 21:26.803
Do you know anything about it?

21:53.134 --> 21:57.135
What's going on?
They didn't do their homework?

21:57.234 --> 21:59.405
They were handing out flyers
at the university.

21:59.534 --> 22:01.409
Just stupid kids
who want to start a revolution.

22:01.534 --> 22:04.341
It's been three days since deposed
president Ben Ali fled Tunisia...

22:04.501 --> 22:06.479
What do you think?

22:06.568 --> 22:10.569
The market is dead and he lets
the Chinese drown the market.

22:10.701 --> 22:13.178
- Very patriotic, Yosef.
- What the hell are you talking about?

22:13.301 --> 22:14.677
We're working so hard.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.778
Momo and I barely sleep
just trying to maintain things.

22:17.867 --> 22:20.402
If you don't like it
then let's switch places.

22:20.534 --> 22:22.011
Easy, easy, guys.

22:22.134 --> 22:24.737
You're not the only one
with eagles on his shoulders.

22:24.833 --> 22:27.175
- Exactly.
- Are you his fucking echo?

22:27.301 --> 22:29.835
I'd gladly move the goalposts.

22:29.900 --> 22:32.071
But believe me, you'll lose.

22:32.200 --> 22:36.235
Nobody moves a thing but me.
Understood?

22:36.367 --> 22:37.538
- Of course.
- But, Mr Kammal...

22:37.668 --> 22:40.043
Am I making myself clear?

22:40.167 --> 22:44.339
And you, work harder.
I expect more.

22:44.501 --> 22:47.604
Or we will have to
reevaluate things.

22:49.301 --> 22:52.108
Tunisia is going to shit
and still beat us at football.

22:52.200 --> 22:55.007
What a scandal!

22:55.134 --> 22:57.271
And you can drop the Hilton case.

22:57.367 --> 22:59.470
The prosecutor closed it as suicide.

22:59.568 --> 23:02.704
What? Suicide?

23:02.833 --> 23:05.607
- She slit her own throat?
- Apparently.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.007
Congratulations.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.201
Move along. You read it, you buy it.

23:26.334 --> 23:29.210
I don't read.
I'm just looking at the pictures.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.075
Give me some washing powder.

23:36.167 --> 23:38.611
And chocolate too.

23:44.234 --> 23:49.076
- Hey. Did Majok call you?
- No.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.405
Here's the chocolate you like.

23:52.900 --> 23:56.276
Who can read Arabic?

23:56.467 --> 23:57.773
Clinton.

23:59.134 --> 24:00.839
That asshole. Anyone else?

24:00.900 --> 24:03.844
Little Muhammad.

24:09.367 --> 24:13.674
Shafiq Holding Group

24:13.800 --> 24:18.767
Hatem Shafiq,
CEO of Shafiq Holding,

24:18.867 --> 24:23.902
the leader in construction
and cement distribution:

24:24.034 --> 24:27.535
We are building the new Cairo.

24:36.367 --> 24:39.538
- Who's Hamada Mansour?
- They took him away.

24:45.967 --> 24:49.343
Who decided to bring down our president?

24:49.501 --> 24:53.445
You don't want to talk?
C'mon. I'm getting bored.

24:54.967 --> 24:57.468
I want to go see the game.

24:57.567 --> 25:01.011
Come on, are you going to
give us a name or not?

25:03.800 --> 25:07.176
What's his name?

25:10.134 --> 25:18.126
The President ignited the spark
of a construction boom

25:18.467 --> 25:25.741
with the start of a total development
and urban revival movement.

25:25.833 --> 25:31.107
Egyptian products have reached a global level
of competitiveness in the export market.

25:31.200 --> 25:35.974
The return of investment being
channelled into infrastructure

25:36.067 --> 25:44.059
like roads, communications, or water,
agriculture and manufacturing projects...

27:35.867 --> 27:42.869
We're on schedule.
I'm sure we'll all be proud of this.

27:55.334 --> 27:58.107
I'm very sorry to have to
bother you with this, sir.

28:01.700 --> 28:03.871
Do you recognize this woman?

28:10.334 --> 28:11.811
No, I don't.

28:14.334 --> 28:17.039
Sorry, sir. Can you look
at the photo one more time?

28:18.533 --> 28:21.205
Are you absolutely certain
you've never seen her before?

28:21.334 --> 28:26.039
- What did you say your name was?
- Major Noredin Mustafa.

28:26.167 --> 28:28.145
Noredin.

28:29.533 --> 28:33.034
I thought the police protected
good citizens.

28:33.167 --> 28:35.145
Not bothered them.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.937
- Is the car ready?
- Ready, sir.

30:01.000 --> 30:06.138
- What do the police want with you?
- I don't know.

30:06.234 --> 30:08.541
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

30:08.667 --> 30:10.338
I will take you to the police.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.637
Stop!

30:12.733 --> 30:14.836
Someone was murdered at the hotel.

30:14.900 --> 30:19.275
A woman was killed.
I saw the man who killed her.

30:20.567 --> 30:22.545
I have something here.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.178
This is the man I saw.

30:34.900 --> 30:37.707
I told him, $10,000 for pilgrimage?

30:37.833 --> 30:40.141
That's theft!

30:40.233 --> 30:44.042
Are you trying to rip off an
Egyptian police officer?

30:44.167 --> 30:47.337
He said it's not a high price to pay

30:47.500 --> 30:51.876
to be cleansed from sin
like a newborn baby.

30:51.967 --> 30:55.104
But they were very nice days
and I prayed for you.

30:55.199 --> 30:57.803
God bless you, Uncle.

30:57.900 --> 31:00.503
OK, if you'll excuse us, sir.

31:00.633 --> 31:02.474
Stay, Noredin.
I want a word with you.

31:02.567 --> 31:04.045
Yes, sir.

31:05.466 --> 31:08.740
- What?
- Why did you go to see Shafiq?

31:11.900 --> 31:14.037
He had something
with the dead singer.

31:14.167 --> 31:17.838
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

31:17.900 --> 31:23.503
- Didn't we agree to close the case?
- Yes.

31:23.633 --> 31:26.907
You're more than a nephew to me.

31:26.967 --> 31:30.672
But when these people call,
I can't protect you.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.778
He's best friends with the president's son.

31:34.667 --> 31:37.804
All right, be good.

31:56.333 --> 31:59.777
Shafiq agreed to meet me.

32:03.533 --> 32:09.035
But I have to make sure it's not a trap.

32:10.900 --> 32:15.344
- I will ask him for a million.
- A million?

32:22.034 --> 32:24.568
- A million is too much.
- Salwa.

32:24.700 --> 32:27.177
Ask for a hundred thousand.

32:27.300 --> 32:32.643
Girl, if they're going to kill someone,
it will be me, not you.

32:32.733 --> 32:36.700
Why don't you trust me, huh?

32:37.700 --> 32:39.678
I don't trust anyone.

32:40.533 --> 32:43.511
And we must split the money
between the three of us.

32:48.233 --> 32:51.837
Fine. No problem.

32:54.366 --> 32:57.708
- The internet is down.
- I know, but I want Facebook.

32:57.833 --> 32:59.435
Facebook is on the internet.

32:59.533 --> 33:00.875
What do you mean,
the internet is on Facebook?

33:00.967 --> 33:02.603
No, Facebook is on the internet.

33:02.700 --> 33:06.234
So what's the difference?
Are you trying to be a smartass?

33:06.366 --> 33:07.343
No, sir.

33:08.733 --> 33:10.608
Where the fuck are you going?

33:10.733 --> 33:12.711
Come get me this fucking Facebook.

33:12.833 --> 33:14.674
All right, I'll take care of it.

33:18.466 --> 33:22.274
Listen, Gina, the Tunisian singer
is waiting for you inside.

33:22.366 --> 33:23.673
All right, calm down.

33:30.533 --> 33:32.875
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

33:37.867 --> 33:41.743
My friend disappeared.
I don't know where she is.

33:43.166 --> 33:46.701
She said she had
an appointment at Nile Hilton.

33:46.833 --> 33:48.811
Then she disappeared.

33:57.133 --> 33:59.236
What's your friend's name?

33:59.333 --> 34:01.311
Lalena.

34:08.733 --> 34:10.710
The singer?

34:16.500 --> 34:20.308
- Did she say who she was meeting?
- A friend.

34:25.833 --> 34:27.275
Has something happened to her?

34:29.199 --> 34:31.199
Your friend was murdered.

34:42.900 --> 34:44.536
She had pictures.

34:46.833 --> 34:48.811
Private pictures.

34:50.998 --> 34:53.273
She didn't want anyone to see them.

35:07.567 --> 35:09.101
How much do you want?

35:10.800 --> 35:13.107
We don't have any pictures, miss.

35:18.300 --> 35:21.608
Twenty thousand, that's all I've got.

35:25.567 --> 35:30.204
A lady like yourself shouldn't be
coming to a place like this.

35:31.166 --> 35:34.440
Leave your name and address, please.

35:48.833 --> 35:52.436
Enough. Show's over.

35:53.567 --> 35:55.875
- Sir.
- Saleh.

35:55.966 --> 35:59.103
- He fixed your dish and it works great.
- Finally.

35:59.199 --> 36:03.166
But for some reason
it only picks up Italian channels.

36:03.300 --> 36:07.574
- What?
- You only get Italian channels.

36:07.667 --> 36:09.872
Italian TV is good.

36:09.999 --> 36:11.977
Is this your cousin?

36:57.832 --> 37:02.140
- Yeah?
- Hello? Hello?

37:02.233 --> 37:04.404
Who's this?

37:04.533 --> 37:06.840
- Major Noredin?
- Yes.

38:12.966 --> 38:15.137
Excuse me, where's the toilet?

38:48.667 --> 38:50.645
Open it.

38:54.366 --> 38:58.242
I was with her that night
at the hotel.

39:10.866 --> 39:12.866
He still has the negatives.

39:16.166 --> 39:19.007
He'll pin the murder on me
if I don't pay him.

39:23.899 --> 39:30.776
He thought he owned her,
her manager, Nagy, the Tunisian.

39:35.866 --> 39:38.844
But you're a member of parliament.

39:38.899 --> 39:41.343
You have legislative immunity.

39:41.500 --> 39:42.943
No one is immune to scandal.

39:46.567 --> 39:48.669
The investigation has been closed.

39:51.333 --> 39:53.311
I can get it opened again.

39:56.133 --> 39:57.667
Why do you need me?

39:59.899 --> 40:05.173
When you first came to me,
you knew I could crush you.

40:05.300 --> 40:07.278
Destroy you.

40:08.666 --> 40:14.941
I've never asked anyone for help,
but now I'm asking you.

40:16.666 --> 40:18.871
I loved her.

40:20.066 --> 40:22.044
And she loved me.

40:23.300 --> 40:25.437
She wanted me to leave my wife.

40:27.732 --> 40:30.506
She was going to steal back
the negatives.

40:38.133 --> 40:40.804
How did you meet her?

40:42.166 --> 40:43.269
Club Solitaire.

40:47.199 --> 40:49.972
Men are forbidden to wear gold.

40:51.133 --> 40:55.100
They say it turns into shackles of fire
on Judgement Day.

40:56.899 --> 40:59.343
But for some, it's worth it.

41:03.567 --> 41:06.044
Where are the negatives, Amir?

41:14.866 --> 41:18.867
- A police officer took them.
- An officer?

41:20.333 --> 41:21.969
Calm down, Nagy.

41:22.066 --> 41:24.101
I'm telling the truth.

41:39.500 --> 41:41.535
I believe you, Amir.

41:47.199 --> 41:51.836
If people in this life
gathered and loved one another,

41:51.899 --> 41:54.877
then God the Almighty will say

41:54.999 --> 41:58.841
"Come. Take each others hands
and enter paradise."

41:58.899 --> 42:02.275
It makes a difference.
Imagine if the people sitting here

42:02.466 --> 42:06.308
had specific goals in life
they want to achieve and live for.

42:06.466 --> 42:13.069
If this number of people only,
not the entire Muslim nation

42:13.166 --> 42:17.508
just this number here,
have goals to live for...

42:21.899 --> 42:25.275
The car's owner charges me 180
at the end of the shift

42:25.466 --> 42:28.342
and you want me to start the meter?

42:29.966 --> 42:32.910
We're getting fucked in this country
and no one cares

42:32.999 --> 42:35.307
while those bastards
go and get treated abroad.

42:35.466 --> 42:39.342
We can't even afford cigarettes
anymore.

42:39.499 --> 42:43.000
But you, sir, seem like a gentleman.
Here.

42:43.133 --> 42:45.111
All right, cool.

42:48.566 --> 42:52.067
Did you see what happened
to that kid in Alexandria?

42:52.199 --> 42:56.007
Those fucking officers ganged up on him
and beat him to death.

42:56.133 --> 42:58.111
Can you believe it?

42:58.966 --> 43:00.568
You son of a pimp!

43:02.966 --> 43:08.967
These internet kids
published the boy's picture online.

43:09.066 --> 43:11.873
They are going to demonstrate
on January 25th.

43:11.966 --> 43:14.466
Police Day.

43:14.566 --> 43:19.738
We're gonna show those dirty pigs
what the people really think.

43:20.566 --> 43:24.170
I'm thinking of going.
What about you?

43:24.300 --> 43:28.675
I have to.
I'm one of those pigs.

43:32.199 --> 43:35.972
Those fucking Alexandrians are liars.

43:36.066 --> 43:38.044
I'm sure that kid was some pothead.

43:38.166 --> 43:41.337
It is rather unbelievable, right?

43:41.499 --> 43:43.875
Would they just beat him up like that
for no reason?

43:48.366 --> 43:51.866
- Inspection. Open up.
- Welcome.

43:53.732 --> 43:55.710
How are you, sweetheart?

44:16.465 --> 44:18.443
Look who's here.

44:19.732 --> 44:22.233
- How are you?
- What an honour.

44:22.366 --> 44:24.866
- How's business?
- Wonderful.

44:24.966 --> 44:28.933
I'm going to sell this shithole
so they can turn it into a mosque.

44:30.866 --> 44:33.071
What gives us the pleasure?

44:34.866 --> 44:37.503
Listen, you know this guy Nagy?

44:37.632 --> 44:40.236
- Nagy the pimp?
- No, the music producer.

44:41.133 --> 44:43.576
Music?

44:43.666 --> 44:48.701
Listen, he's got these girls
that dance and sing, wannabe artists.

44:48.832 --> 44:50.503
He works at this VIP club.

44:50.632 --> 44:54.804
The girls lure the men and he takes
their pictures to blackmail them.

44:54.899 --> 44:56.877
He's been doing this forever.

44:56.966 --> 45:00.910
He uses this old camera
to make them pay extra tor the negatives.

45:00.966 --> 45:05.240
- Where can I find him?
- He's got this club...

45:05.333 --> 45:08.106
- Club Solitaire?
- Exactly.

45:08.199 --> 45:10.870
That's it, man. You know everything.

45:10.966 --> 45:13.103
- What do you need him for?
- I want to "sing".

45:15.666 --> 45:17.507
Can you get a drink around here or what?

45:17.632 --> 45:20.236
Man, this is your place. Come.

45:20.332 --> 45:22.332
Don't worry, I'll pay for it.

45:34.866 --> 45:38.003
Congratulations, sir!

45:38.133 --> 45:40.940
Congratulations!

45:44.365 --> 45:46.400
Goodbye.

45:46.532 --> 45:50.204
- What's this?
- Congratulations, Colonel.

45:50.332 --> 45:52.503
Colonel?

45:52.632 --> 45:54.610
Check it out. Try it on.

45:57.033 --> 45:59.874
You're a genius and I'm an idiot.

45:59.966 --> 46:02.637
What do you have on Shafiq?

46:02.732 --> 46:06.437
He had something going on with
the singer and doesn't want a scandal.

46:06.566 --> 46:10.067
He claims her manager killed her.

46:10.199 --> 46:11.870
Of course her manager killed her.

46:11.966 --> 46:14.910
The prosecutor agreed
to reopen the case.

46:14.966 --> 46:17.842
We'll give him a hundred thousand.

46:17.899 --> 46:21.173
You and I split the rest.
Some good money.

46:21.299 --> 46:25.471
You'll buy a Peugeot
instead of your crappy car.

46:25.566 --> 46:27.010
God willing.

46:27.133 --> 46:29.303
I'm really proud of you, Noredin.

46:29.465 --> 46:33.137
You have us working directly
with the VIP.

46:34.866 --> 46:37.003
One day you will be sitting
in my chair.

46:43.166 --> 46:45.144
What happened?

46:47.966 --> 46:49.944
He agreed to a million.

46:50.899 --> 46:53.399
Why did you do that?
What if they followed you?

46:53.532 --> 46:56.305
I told you a hundred thousand.

46:56.465 --> 46:59.272
You must split it with us.
You hear me?

47:11.066 --> 47:13.236
- Good evening.
- Welcome, sir.

48:03.966 --> 48:09.342
You who are travelling alone

48:09.499 --> 48:13.875
You who are travelling alone

48:14.966 --> 48:19.910
And leaving me behind

48:19.966 --> 48:23.239
Why are you leaving me?

48:23.966 --> 48:30.638
Why are you leaving me and haunting me?

48:33.299 --> 48:41.291
Leave me without saying goodbye

48:42.033 --> 48:46.670
My heart has already fared you well

48:48.365 --> 48:56.357
Leave me without saying goodbye

48:57.632 --> 49:04.338
My heart has already fared you well

49:05.499 --> 49:11.500
My eyes speak to you with tears

49:11.632 --> 49:18.474
My eyes speak to you with tears

49:19.365 --> 49:27.357
You who are travelling alone
and leaving me behind

49:28.632 --> 49:32.804
Why are you leaving me?

49:32.899 --> 49:40.003
Why are you leaving me and haunting me?

49:56.699 --> 49:59.870
Major, what brings you here?

49:59.999 --> 50:02.772
It's Colonel now. I got promoted.

50:07.499 --> 50:08.806
Your voice is amazing.

50:11.198 --> 50:13.176
I don't drink.

50:19.165 --> 50:21.769
Come, let me introduce you
to my friends.

50:21.866 --> 50:23.070
No, no, no.

50:24.165 --> 50:25.302
Mido!

50:25.465 --> 50:28.671
- You were amazing.
- Thank you.

50:28.799 --> 50:32.005
- This is Noredin, my boyfriend.

50:32.132 --> 50:34.008
Lucky man.

50:34.132 --> 50:36.110
What industry are you in?

50:37.532 --> 50:40.032
- Listen, I...
- Ceramics.

50:40.165 --> 50:43.143
Biggest toilet manufacturer
in the Middle East.

50:43.232 --> 50:45.836
Haven't you heard of "Noredin Toilets"?

50:47.632 --> 50:51.007
You've probably
taken a piss in one.

50:53.832 --> 50:58.537
Tell them about the gold toilet
you made for the president.

50:58.666 --> 51:02.667
Honey, we try to honour
our customers' privacy.

52:19.899 --> 52:21.877
You like the view?

52:25.632 --> 52:27.769
I have to work tomorrow.

52:35.198 --> 52:38.903
Did you know that Lalena was having
an affair with a powerful man?

52:41.165 --> 52:43.972
She said she loved someone.

52:50.799 --> 52:52.606
Do you know Nagy, the Tunisian?

52:54.699 --> 52:56.677
Come with me.

53:01.732 --> 53:03.710
Wait upstairs.

56:06.165 --> 56:10.768
We're looking for Nagy, the Tunisian.

56:10.865 --> 56:12.207
He killed your friend.

56:23.731 --> 56:26.107
What do you want from me?

56:27.998 --> 56:29.976
You want to put me in danger?

56:30.998 --> 56:32.305
You're in danger?

56:35.198 --> 56:39.233
No, I don't know him.

56:51.698 --> 56:56.302
Tell me, why did you leave your country?

57:00.566 --> 57:02.601
I just want to live my dream.

57:07.332 --> 57:09.310
I'm an artist.

57:11.499 --> 57:13.474
Some people with money
want to put you in a golden cage.

57:13.499 --> 57:18.841
Some people with money
want to put you in a golden cage.

57:21.032 --> 57:24.533
You can't fly away
even if you have the key.

57:32.198 --> 57:34.801
What about you?

57:34.898 --> 57:39.842
Is it the money? Or maybe...

57:51.865 --> 57:54.469
Can I see you again?

58:03.665 --> 58:06.768
Wissen.

58:06.865 --> 58:08.843
Wissen?

58:13.065 --> 58:15.599
Wissen.

58:15.731 --> 58:17.107
All right, wissen.

58:19.565 --> 58:20.838
Wissen.

58:40.731 --> 58:42.266
This fucking early?

58:52.565 --> 58:54.407
Salwa!

58:56.032 --> 58:59.010
Salwa, the police are here for you.

59:00.332 --> 59:02.310
Salwa, come here.

59:09.698 --> 59:11.539
Wait.

59:14.165 --> 59:15.938
Wait.

59:19.498 --> 59:20.973
I'll tell him you left.

59:20.998 --> 59:21.532
I'll tell him you left.

01:02:21.798 --> 01:02:24.174
Hurry up, kid. Move it. Faster.

01:02:24.299 --> 01:02:24.974
What's going on, Ali?

01:02:24.998 --> 01:02:26.907
What's going on, Ali?

01:02:26.965 --> 01:02:29.806
Colonel Noredin, it's crazy
over at the Arbaa W Nuss precinct.

01:02:29.898 --> 01:02:32.432
They say an officer killed
two Sudanese there,

01:02:32.565 --> 01:02:36.032
some mayor called Clinton
and a young girl.

01:02:36.165 --> 01:02:37.165
What are you talking about?

01:02:37.298 --> 01:02:38.742
Don't worry, sir.
We've got it under control.

01:02:45.798 --> 01:02:47.003
What's up, Noredin?

01:02:47.132 --> 01:02:51.133
The cleaning girl was murdered.
The one from the Hilton.

01:02:51.232 --> 01:02:52.868
The only witness?

01:02:52.998 --> 01:02:58.340
- I made a mistake.
- Don't tell me. Should I be worried?

01:02:58.498 --> 01:03:00.806
No. I know where to find Nagy.

01:03:15.065 --> 01:03:16.940
Call Gina for me.

01:03:17.065 --> 01:03:19.043
She's not in.

01:03:19.898 --> 01:03:21.473
I said call Gina!

01:03:21.498 --> 01:03:21.532
I said call Gina!

01:03:47.665 --> 01:03:49.473
Come out, Nagy!

01:03:49.498 --> 01:03:49.669
Come out, Nagy!

01:03:49.798 --> 01:03:51.776
Open up!

01:03:58.898 --> 01:04:00.876
Nagy!

01:07:38.798 --> 01:07:40.070
Noredin?

01:07:42.164 --> 01:07:46.267
- Relax. Are you upset?
- Keep moving.

01:07:46.364 --> 01:07:48.342
Take it easy.

01:07:59.997 --> 01:08:02.475
- Good evening.
- Shut up.

01:08:04.331 --> 01:08:04.473
Who the fuck are you?

01:08:04.498 --> 01:08:06.305
Who the fuck are you?

01:08:08.498 --> 01:08:10.339
Colonel Noredin Mustafa.

01:08:10.498 --> 01:08:12.476
- Colonel?
- Yes, Colonel.

01:08:12.565 --> 01:08:15.600
- Which precinct?
- Kasr El-Nil.

01:08:19.331 --> 01:08:21.639
This is not Kasr El-Nil.

01:08:25.331 --> 01:08:28.832
This man is accused of murder.

01:08:28.898 --> 01:08:32.473
No offence, Colonel, but out here
I decide who's a suspect and who's not.

01:08:32.497 --> 01:08:34.840
No offence, Colonel, but out here
I decide who's a suspect and who's not.

01:08:34.898 --> 01:08:37.398
Yeah, tell him, Major Khalil.

01:08:37.531 --> 01:08:42.669
I don't give a fuck who you know.
You're nothing but a junkie.

01:08:44.197 --> 01:08:46.868
Really, Major Khalil?
You let that fat fuck hit me?

01:08:46.964 --> 01:08:46.971
Shut the fuck up!
Have we met before?

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:52.169
Shut the fuck up!
Have we met before?

01:08:52.298 --> 01:08:54.002
Excuse me, Colonel.

01:09:03.231 --> 01:09:06.232
Shame on you, Major Khalil.
I pay you more.

01:09:07.964 --> 01:09:10.636
Are you accusing me
of taking bribes, asshole?

01:09:10.731 --> 01:09:12.731
Not at all, Major Khalil. Not at all.

01:09:15.731 --> 01:09:17.504
Do you want a lawyer?

01:09:22.631 --> 01:09:25.165
Just kill me.

01:09:25.298 --> 01:09:27.435
I promise I won't tell.

01:09:27.531 --> 01:09:30.737
As you wish. Empty your pockets.

01:09:57.897 --> 01:10:00.273
These too.

01:10:07.331 --> 01:10:08.865
That's all I've got.

01:10:23.197 --> 01:10:26.471
- Did he ask for a lawyer?
- He doesn't want one.

01:10:29.131 --> 01:10:32.735
What's with these early arrests?

01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:35.434
Let's have breakfast first, at least.

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:38.838
Where are the photos of Shafiq?

01:10:38.897 --> 01:10:40.068
You don't have them?

01:10:40.197 --> 01:10:42.902
Lalena stole them from you,
didn't she?

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:46.635
Oh, check out Mr Police officer.
Proper police work.

01:10:47.731 --> 01:10:50.231
You think you're handling
a real investigation?

01:10:50.364 --> 01:10:53.171
Watch your tongue or I'll cut it out.

01:10:54.565 --> 01:10:57.543
Where were you the night of the murder?

01:10:57.665 --> 01:11:00.199
- With Gina.
- Can she confirm that?

01:11:01.665 --> 01:11:02.801
If she's still alive.

01:11:05.631 --> 01:11:09.666
You're suspected of murdering Lalena.

01:11:09.797 --> 01:11:13.332
We'll hold you
for investigation for 15 days.

01:11:22.464 --> 01:11:23.941
Momo!

01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:24.838
What?

01:11:26.565 --> 01:11:29.008
Watch him, but don't talk to him.
He's a snake.

01:11:29.131 --> 01:11:30.131
Where are you going?

01:12:10.498 --> 01:12:11.873
- Where's Momo?
- I don't know.

01:12:11.964 --> 01:12:14.840
- Where the fuck is he?
- I don't know, sir.

01:12:16.631 --> 01:12:18.609
Wake up.

01:12:23.997 --> 01:12:25.975
Get up.

01:12:44.964 --> 01:12:47.272
Where's Momo?

01:12:47.364 --> 01:12:49.467
State Security want to talk to you. Why?

01:12:51.331 --> 01:12:52.933
Nagy is dead.

01:12:53.031 --> 01:12:55.566
Don't worry about it.
We will handle it.

01:12:55.697 --> 01:12:58.574
What will you say it
they are investigating us?

01:12:59.864 --> 01:13:03.308
- Nothing.
- All right, go in uniform.

01:13:03.464 --> 01:13:07.237
If they sniff money,
they'll want a cut-.

01:13:07.331 --> 01:13:10.332
I'm going to hide the Mercedes
at my cousin's.

01:13:13.664 --> 01:13:18.040
I swear to God it wasn't my fault.
I got orders. Please listen...

01:13:18.164 --> 01:13:20.801
You think you can fuck me over?

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:23.205
It's my fault I trusted you!

01:13:42.031 --> 01:13:44.305
Colonel Noredin.

01:13:44.464 --> 01:13:46.499
State Security want to talk to me.

01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:48.608
Why are you telling me?

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:56.669
- Where's Gina?
- Have you forgotten where you...?

01:13:56.797 --> 01:13:59.241
- Where is Gina?
- Keep your voice down.

01:14:00.897 --> 01:14:01.874
Nagy is dead.

01:14:07.231 --> 01:14:10.038
Did he have the pictures?

01:14:10.164 --> 01:14:11.835
No.

01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:21.297
You're a good man, Noredin.
You're doing a good job.

01:15:03.464 --> 01:15:05.305
Have a seat.

01:15:11.864 --> 01:15:15.138
Your name came up in our investigation.

01:15:16.197 --> 01:15:19.232
- Do you know Gina, the singer?
- No.

01:15:20.664 --> 01:15:23.801
They found her dead two hours ago.

01:15:23.897 --> 01:15:26.738
Dumped in the trash
with her throat slit.

01:15:55.164 --> 01:16:00.165
Kammal Mustafa is your uncle, right?
We're investigating him.

01:16:00.298 --> 01:16:02.333
Have you noticed
anything suspicious about him?

01:16:02.497 --> 01:16:03.475
No.

01:16:10.664 --> 01:16:13.505
Two Sudanese were killed
a couple of days ago.

01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:15.904
One of them
was a cleaning girl at the Hilton.

01:16:15.997 --> 01:16:20.169
They say she witnessed the murder.
Have you met her?

01:16:21.131 --> 01:16:23.439
I looked for her
but couldn't find her.

01:16:24.197 --> 01:16:27.232
What's your relation to Hatem Shafiq?

01:16:27.364 --> 01:16:28.500
None.

01:16:31.964 --> 01:16:35.101
Mr Shafiq is a member of parliament.

01:16:35.197 --> 01:16:38.073
Any investigation involving him
is a State Security matter.

01:16:44.497 --> 01:16:46.475
You're excused.

01:17:29.797 --> 01:17:31.900
Welcome back, sir.

01:17:31.964 --> 01:17:35.931
The repairman fixed your dish again.

01:17:36.031 --> 01:17:39.406
Got you more European channels
with sexy girls.

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:41.031
May God forgive us.

01:17:41.164 --> 01:17:42.641
Noredin!

01:17:50.864 --> 01:17:52.842
Saleh!

01:17:54.697 --> 01:17:56.141
Wake up!

01:17:56.231 --> 01:17:58.209
Saleh!

01:18:30.197 --> 01:18:31.868
You! What the fuck are you doing?

01:18:31.997 --> 01:18:36.305
You're under arrest!
Walk! I said walk, you bitch!

01:18:44.064 --> 01:18:46.405
Hold it right there!

01:18:46.530 --> 01:18:48.202
What do you want, Captain?

01:18:48.330 --> 01:18:50.968
I have orders to take them into custody.

01:18:51.064 --> 01:18:52.507
Whose orders?

01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:55.165
There's a bus outside
to send them back to Sudan.

01:18:55.298 --> 01:18:56.969
These cells are for Egyptians only.

01:18:57.064 --> 01:18:58.939
I'll tell the general
you turned them down.

01:18:59.064 --> 01:19:00.735
Tell him whatever you want.

01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:06.036
Sir, I saw what happened at the Hilton.

01:19:11.564 --> 01:19:13.838
Get these fucking people
out of here now.

01:19:13.897 --> 01:19:15.170
- Momo!
- Yeah?

01:19:15.297 --> 01:19:19.901
The Hilton girl.
Get me the prosecutor on the phone.

01:19:19.997 --> 01:19:21.997
Yes, sir.

01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:29.637
- He's not answering, sir.
- Try again.

01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:32.674
Yes, sir. I'll keep trying.

01:19:41.131 --> 01:19:44.007
Sir, I have something important
for you to see.

01:19:44.131 --> 01:19:46.109
Yes, sir.

01:19:55.330 --> 01:19:57.934
Ali, let's go.

01:20:15.164 --> 01:20:17.607
You there, come.

01:20:17.697 --> 01:20:19.675
Come. Don't be afraid.

01:20:21.797 --> 01:20:24.331
Hello?

01:20:24.497 --> 01:20:29.874
I have Salwa, the girl from the hotel.
Yes, she's with me.

01:20:31.131 --> 01:20:34.506
No, Yosef put her in jail,
but I got her out.

01:20:48.997 --> 01:20:51.838
An officer brought her in from Tahrir.

01:20:51.897 --> 01:20:54.340
Are you fucking crazy,
bringing her in a police car?

01:20:54.497 --> 01:20:56.873
She's the only witness.
I brought her...

01:20:56.964 --> 01:21:00.999
Listen! Tell Mr Kammal I ordered her
release.

01:21:01.131 --> 01:21:03.904
And tell him that Shafiq
is trying to get rid of me.

01:21:03.997 --> 01:21:06.440
Be careful.
Talk only to Mr Kammal.

01:21:10.697 --> 01:21:12.675
Salwa?

01:21:14.196 --> 01:21:16.470
Don't be afraid.

01:21:16.564 --> 01:21:18.542
Come with me.

01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:38.774
Are you tired?

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:43.102
Hungry?

01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:41.035
You know,
I love you like a little brother.

01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:47.036
What? You still don't want to talk?

01:23:26.031 --> 01:23:28.009
What did you see?

01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:38.137
I saw Shafiq leaving the room.

01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:41.808
He was putting on his watch.

01:23:43.697 --> 01:23:51.130
I heard a woman in the room say
"You promised me."

01:23:51.230 --> 01:23:54.071
He took the elevator and left.

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:57.474
I went back to work.

01:24:00.230 --> 01:24:03.265
A bit later I heard screaming...

01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:08.501
Another man came out of the room.

01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:14.006
How long after Shafiq left
did you hear the screaming?

01:24:14.130 --> 01:24:17.574
Not long.

01:24:17.664 --> 01:24:21.267
I was in the next corridor.

01:24:33.463 --> 01:24:37.305
It was the same man
that came for Clinton.

01:24:41.463 --> 01:24:46.066
Shafiq thinks you're dead.
It's me he's after now.

01:25:23.897 --> 01:25:26.875
- Can I help you, Officer?
- I'm here for Mr Shafiq.

01:25:26.996 --> 01:25:28.599
Tell him it's Colonel Noredin.

01:25:28.697 --> 01:25:31.970
- Mr Shafiq is playing golf.
- Tell him it's urgent.

01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:36.668
I'm sorry, sir.
Can't let you in without an invitation.

01:25:36.797 --> 01:25:38.832
Are you sure
you want to see my invitation?

01:26:49.363 --> 01:26:52.034
Sorry to bother you, gentlemen.

01:26:52.163 --> 01:26:54.300
Can we talk in private?

01:26:54.463 --> 01:26:57.236
We're at the eleventh.
Can this wait?

01:26:57.330 --> 01:26:59.308
I'm afraid not.

01:27:06.797 --> 01:27:10.297
Lalena had the photo slip
when she was murdered.

01:27:10.463 --> 01:27:13.600
I have the photos.
And the negatives.

01:27:15.297 --> 01:27:17.434
I also have a witness.

01:27:34.564 --> 01:27:36.735
Excuse us, gentlemen.

01:27:46.330 --> 01:27:47.830
I thought you were smart.

01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:51.308
But you are stupid.

01:27:52.564 --> 01:27:54.701
Really fucking stupid!

01:27:55.829 --> 01:27:58.807
You think you're in Switzerland?

01:27:58.896 --> 01:28:00.874
There's no justice here.

01:28:04.297 --> 01:28:06.934
What's this?
What do you think you're doing?

01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:12.304
- Mr Shafiq, you are free to go.
- No, I want my lawyer.

01:28:12.463 --> 01:28:15.997
- Please relax in my office.
- I said I want my lawyer.

01:28:16.130 --> 01:28:20.165
Here they come. God save us.

01:28:28.664 --> 01:28:30.971
Mr Shafiq, how did they treat you?

01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:36.133
You are responsible
for kidnapping a member of parliament.

01:28:36.230 --> 01:28:39.504
Please, calm down.
I know my nephew made a mistake.

01:28:39.630 --> 01:28:42.005
But let us speak
in a civilized manner.

01:28:42.130 --> 01:28:46.131
- Who's the prosecutor here?
- Welcome, sir. Welcome.

01:28:46.230 --> 01:28:49.265
Do you know
the legal disaster you're in?

01:28:57.863 --> 01:29:00.137
Sir.

01:29:01.996 --> 01:29:03.974
Sir.

01:29:05.697 --> 01:29:10.004
Yes, sir. Understood.

01:29:10.130 --> 01:29:15.165
Of course, sir. Of course.

01:29:19.630 --> 01:29:24.301
The prosecutor general
has ordered the arrest of Hatem Shafiq.

01:29:24.463 --> 01:29:29.339
He's charged with the murder
of Lalena at the hotel.

01:29:36.863 --> 01:29:40.137
My wife and kids
must leave for Dubai immediately.

01:29:40.230 --> 01:29:41.207
Yes, sir.

01:29:41.330 --> 01:29:45.035
You know what to do
with the documents.

01:29:48.863 --> 01:29:50.068
You saw me.

01:29:51.564 --> 01:29:57.099
You know I didn't kill her.

01:29:58.163 --> 01:30:00.266
I loved her.

01:30:30.796 --> 01:30:32.774
The bed is inside.

01:30:43.629 --> 01:30:45.903
Is this your wife?

01:30:45.963 --> 01:30:47.941
She's beautiful.

01:30:49.564 --> 01:30:51.542
Where is she?

01:30:54.063 --> 01:30:56.439
She died in a car accident.

01:31:22.829 --> 01:31:24.966
Shafiq didn't kill that woman.

01:31:26.297 --> 01:31:28.275
He said he loved her.

01:31:32.530 --> 01:31:34.508
What's that?

01:31:37.863 --> 01:31:39.841
Pills.

01:31:43.663 --> 01:31:46.471
- For what?
- For peace of mind.

01:32:45.963 --> 01:32:46.940
Yes, sir.

01:32:50.796 --> 01:32:52.240
Roger that, sir.

01:32:52.330 --> 01:32:55.773
We have the orders. Fire!

01:32:55.863 --> 01:32:59.864
- Fire at who?
- Shoot at them, Yosef!

01:33:14.496 --> 01:33:16.838
Mr Kammal! Mr Kammal!

01:33:45.496 --> 01:33:51.998
Over 10,000 demonstrators gathered
at Tahrir Square in Cairo.

01:33:52.130 --> 01:33:56.471
Some demonstrators
pelted the police with rocks

01:33:56.563 --> 01:33:59.734
on Kasr El-Ayni street near Tahrir,

01:33:59.863 --> 01:34:05.331
while many of them rioted
and vandalised public property.

01:34:07.729 --> 01:34:10.071
Come on! Move it!

01:34:10.196 --> 01:34:12.400
- I'll wait for you.
- Go, Yosef! Go!

01:34:12.529 --> 01:34:15.666
- Mr. Kammal!
- What do you want?

01:34:15.796 --> 01:34:20.968
The people want
to bring down the regime!

01:34:21.063 --> 01:34:26.007
According to the president,

01:34:26.130 --> 01:34:31.336
curfew starts
in about two and a halt minutes.

01:34:31.496 --> 01:34:35.531
How are things looking in the streets?

01:34:35.663 --> 01:34:43.655
Citizens just want to secure
bread, fruit, and water right now.

01:34:44.796 --> 01:34:51.105
The average citizen
knows his duties towards his family.

01:34:54.130 --> 01:34:55.107
Uncle?

01:34:59.496 --> 01:35:00.530
Uncle?

01:35:00.663 --> 01:35:06.608
People are following the orders
of the military commander,

01:35:06.696 --> 01:35:09.640
President Muhammad Hosni Mubarak,

01:35:09.729 --> 01:35:16.901
who enforced a curfew at six o'clock,
due to the incidents...

01:35:34.896 --> 01:35:36.874
Hello.

01:35:39.163 --> 01:35:41.141
Anyone there?

01:35:42.863 --> 01:35:44.670
Hello?

01:35:44.796 --> 01:35:47.672
Yeah, coming.

01:35:47.796 --> 01:35:50.296
Good afternoon.

01:35:50.462 --> 01:35:53.100
Three packs of Cleopatra.

01:35:54.329 --> 01:35:56.307
Here you go.

01:36:24.896 --> 01:36:26.033
Salwa!

01:36:39.496 --> 01:36:43.304
Where are you going?
Only you know the truth!

01:36:44.896 --> 01:36:49.271
The man you shot,
have you seen him before?

01:36:49.462 --> 01:36:51.440
A1 the Hilton?

01:37:08.296 --> 01:37:10.274
Come.

01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:15.605
Hurry! Go!

01:37:15.729 --> 01:37:18.673
Leave this country.
There's nothing for you here.

01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:32.605
Police! Get back inside! Now!

01:37:40.896 --> 01:37:42.532
State Security Officer

01:38:06.496 --> 01:38:08.031
Uncle.

01:38:08.162 --> 01:38:10.436
- Uncle!
- Where are you?

01:39:11.195 --> 01:39:14.072
Where's Mr Kammal?

01:39:14.195 --> 01:39:16.673
Mr Kammal!

01:39:16.796 --> 01:39:18.774
Safe journey.

01:39:22.496 --> 01:39:24.474
Let's move.

01:39:35.796 --> 01:39:38.137
You're letting him get away?

01:39:38.229 --> 01:39:39.935
Of course. We got our money.

01:39:40.062 --> 01:39:41.904
We can't do this. He killed her.

01:39:42.030 --> 01:39:43.564
No, he didn't.

01:39:43.696 --> 01:39:45.196
He just tell in love with
the wrong girl.

01:39:45.329 --> 01:39:47.035
Relax. We got our money.

01:40:08.462 --> 01:40:10.565
Why did you let him go?

01:40:14.329 --> 01:40:15.500
Why?

01:40:15.629 --> 01:40:18.630
Calm down, it's over.
We got our money.

01:40:21.529 --> 01:40:23.165
I have a body in my car.

01:40:23.296 --> 01:40:24.968
The killer.

01:40:25.062 --> 01:40:27.040
He's a State Security officer.

01:41:46.129 --> 01:41:50.232
This whole mess will be over
in a couple of days.

01:41:50.329 --> 01:41:55.706
The president will call in the army
and they'll ride our backs.

01:41:57.462 --> 01:42:00.497
Did you have anything to do
with Lalena's murder?

01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:02.732
Goddamn heartburn.

01:42:02.829 --> 01:42:04.965
I need to eat something.

01:42:05.062 --> 01:42:06.540
Did you kill her?

01:42:06.663 --> 01:42:10.197
What are you talking about?
Of course not!

01:42:10.329 --> 01:42:16.932
Well... I knew about Nagy's business.

01:42:17.896 --> 01:42:21.237
He took pictures of all these men
with his girls.

01:42:21.362 --> 01:42:25.465
And I got a little piece of the pie.

01:42:25.563 --> 01:42:30.029
But when we got the photos of Shafiq,
that was something else.

01:42:30.162 --> 01:42:32.834
State Security contacted me.

01:42:32.895 --> 01:42:37.169
I thought we went too far.

01:42:37.296 --> 01:42:41.331
But instead they wanted in, of course.

01:42:41.496 --> 01:42:45.167
They turned it really ugly.

01:42:45.296 --> 01:42:48.672
Poor girl,
she was worth more dead than alive.

01:42:50.829 --> 01:42:53.807
May she rest in peace.

01:42:53.895 --> 01:42:55.271
What can we do?

01:43:15.663 --> 01:43:18.300
Is something wrong?

01:43:19.962 --> 01:43:21.940
Are you ok?

01:43:24.029 --> 01:43:26.007
You're not feeling well?

01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:28.865
You killed Gina too.

01:44:53.296 --> 01:44:55.274
Are you crazy?

01:44:55.362 --> 01:44:57.340
You want to arrest me?

01:44:57.496 --> 01:44:59.599
I treated you like a son.

01:45:01.162 --> 01:45:03.538
How dare you?

01:45:03.663 --> 01:45:05.799
All right, you want to arrest me?

01:45:05.895 --> 01:45:08.169
Then arrest me, Officer!

01:45:08.296 --> 01:45:09.273
Arrest me!

01:45:09.362 --> 01:45:11.033
He's police... He has a gun!

01:45:37.862 --> 01:45:41.329
Enough! Stop it!
We are not like them!

01:45:41.496 --> 01:45:43.030
Enough!
We're not like them!
