<i>NARRATOR: In the fall of 2009,
a new couple had moved in upstairs.</i>

00:03.800 --> 00:04.867
<i>We hadn't met them yet,</i>

00:04.867 --> 00:07.434
<i>but we could hear them,
all the time.</i>

00:07.434 --> 00:08.734
<i>They were always...</i>

00:08.734 --> 00:10.533
<i>Well, kids, let's just say
they were always</i>

00:10.533 --> 00:12.134
<i>"playing the bagpipes."</i>

00:17.533 --> 00:19.600
Okay, this is ridiculous.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.700
I can't believe those
two are still bagpiping.

00:21.700 --> 00:24.134
I know. It's been six hours.

00:24.134 --> 00:26.800
Must be that tantric bagpiping
that Sting is into.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.633
She keeps yelling out for him
to play the bagpipes harder,

00:29.633 --> 00:31.934
but it sounds like he's
bagpiping her pretty hard.

00:31.934 --> 00:33.533
There's a glass of water
in my bedroom

00:33.533 --> 00:35.468
<i>that's vibrating
like Jurassic Park.</i>

00:36.667 --> 00:38.934
You have neighbors!

00:38.934 --> 00:41.134
Shut the bagpipes up!

to get some peace and quie</i>

00:56.968 --> 00:58.834
<i>That didn't work out so well.</i>

00:58.834 --> 00:59.868
Ted, I hate to have

00:59.868 --> 01:02.701
to be the one
to tell you this.

01:02.701 --> 01:04.566
Marshall and Lily
are getting a divorce.

01:04.566 --> 01:07.167
No, they're not.
Just listen

01:07.167 --> 01:09.701
to what I witnessed yesterday.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.267
Baby, you mind washing that?

01:12.267 --> 01:15.400
No problem.

01:16.150 --> 01:17.484
I should go.

01:18.684 --> 01:22.850
She makes him wash his dishes
right away, Ted.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.618
I give 'em two,
maybe, three weeks tops.

01:25.618 --> 01:28.050
Barney, that's not a big deal.
And it's certainly

01:28.050 --> 01:30.384
not a big enough deal for you
to be holding my hands.

01:31.551 --> 01:33.084
They're in big trouble, Ted.

01:33.084 --> 01:34.417
I see what's going on.

01:34.417 --> 01:37.317
You, my friend, are suffering
from a little known condition--

01:37.317 --> 01:39.551
"little known" because I just
made it up--

01:39.551 --> 01:42.384
called New Relationship
Smugness.

01:42.384 --> 01:45.117
You and Robin are
in the honeymoon phase.

01:45.117 --> 01:46.651
Everything's perfect.

01:46.651 --> 01:48.484
Every song on the radio's
about you.

01:48.484 --> 01:49.984
Every other couple sucks.

01:49.984 --> 01:52.551
Enjoy it.
N.R.S. doesn't last forever.

01:52.551 --> 01:55.184
It does when
you're this awesome.

01:55.184 --> 01:56.917
Hey, check it out.
Robin and I have been

01:56.917 --> 01:59.117
keeping a tally of how many beds
we've done it in.

01:59.117 --> 02:01.251
We're up to 83-and-a-half.

02:01.251 --> 02:02.184
A half?

02:02.184 --> 02:03.584
19 century ottoman

02:03.584 --> 02:04.883
in an antique shop.

02:06.717 --> 02:08.783
Hey.
Hey, what'up?

02:08.783 --> 02:11.117
Hey, tiger.

02:11.117 --> 02:13.151
How ya holding up?
Do you need a hug?

02:13.151 --> 02:14.817
You want to talk
about yesterday?

02:14.817 --> 02:16.117
Safe space.

02:16.117 --> 02:18.650
Barney thinks Lily
asking you to wash your dishes

02:18.650 --> 02:21.617
right away is a sign your
marriage is crumbling. What?

02:21.617 --> 02:22.717
Why?

02:22.717 --> 02:24.418
Lily likes a clean sink,
so I do the dishes

02:24.418 --> 02:25.583
right away;
what's the big deal?

02:25.583 --> 02:29.184
I'll tell you
what the big deal is.

02:29.184 --> 02:32.817
You know how I was always
the best at being single?

02:32.817 --> 02:34.151
No.
No.

02:34.151 --> 02:37.583
Well, now I am the best
at relationships.

02:37.583 --> 02:39.351
Even better than you and Lily.

02:39.351 --> 02:41.351
Aw, look at you.

02:41.351 --> 02:43.384
Had a girlfriend for five
minutes, you think you can

02:43.384 --> 02:46.084
play with the big boys--
adorable. Son...

02:46.084 --> 02:48.351
I've been in a relationship
since you had a ponytail

02:48.351 --> 02:50.683
and were playing Dave Matthews
on your mama's Casio.

02:50.683 --> 02:51.884
I'm a good boyfriend

02:51.884 --> 02:54.551
in my sleep.
I can rock a killer foot rub

02:54.551 --> 02:57.618
with one hand and brew a
kick-ass pot of chamomile

02:57.618 --> 02:59.351
in the other that
would make you weep.

03:00.051 --> 03:01.151
Hell,

03:01.151 --> 03:02.951
I've forgotten more
about microwaving

03:02.951 --> 03:04.218
fat-free popcorn
and watching

03:04.218 --> 03:05.951
Sandra Bullock movies
than you'll ever know,

03:05.951 --> 03:09.151
but thanks for
your concern, rook.

03:09.151 --> 03:11.617
Mashall, let me ask you
one question.

03:11.617 --> 03:12.851
Sure.

03:12.851 --> 03:15.817
Do you mind if there is
sink full of dirty dishes?

03:15.817 --> 03:17.717
Not really.

03:18.717 --> 03:20.051
Then it's Lily's problem,
not yours.

03:20.051 --> 03:21.784
Yeah, but if I said
that to her,

03:21.784 --> 03:23.750
it would only lead to a fight, so...
Oh.

03:23.750 --> 03:24.917
You fight.

03:24.917 --> 03:26.251
See, Robin and I never fight.

03:26.251 --> 03:28.483
Of course you do.
No.

03:28.483 --> 03:31.084
And here's the secret:
every time it looks like

03:31.084 --> 03:32.750
we're about to get
into a fight...

03:32.750 --> 03:34.584
Um, why is there

03:34.584 --> 03:38.951
a bag of panties labeled
"April 2008" in your closet?

03:51.417 --> 03:53.550
So any time you think
you might have a fight

03:53.550 --> 03:54.750
you just get up and leave?

03:54.750 --> 03:56.617
100% effective.

03:56.617 --> 03:58.151
Can't fight
if you're not there.

03:58.151 --> 03:59.817
That's what Gandhi taught us.

03:59.817 --> 04:01.105
Boy, that's not true.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.150
I can't believe that
Robin puts up with that.

04:04.150 --> 04:04.984
Oh, don't worry.

04:04.984 --> 04:07.184
She's got a great way
to avoid fights, too.

04:07.184 --> 04:10.317
Um, are ties
machine washable?

04:10.317 --> 04:14.050
No, they most certainly
are not. Why?

04:14.950 --> 04:17.216
What is in your hand?

04:17.216 --> 04:19.384
Oh, my God,
what's in your hand?!

04:25.451 --> 04:27.484
Okay, so you walk away.

04:27.484 --> 04:28.584
Robin gets naked.

04:28.584 --> 04:30.184
Those are the two
stupidest ways

04:30.184 --> 04:31.551
to handle conflict
I've ever heard.

04:31.551 --> 04:33.484
Actually, the naked
thing ain't bad.

04:35.150 --> 04:38.517
That felt kind of weird.
Okay, call me crazy.

04:38.517 --> 04:40.917
But when a problem comes up,
Lily and I

04:40.917 --> 04:42.384
actually talk about it.

04:42.384 --> 04:44.784
There are so many great things
to do withhe human mouth.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.951
Why waste it on talking?

04:46.951 --> 04:48.917
But if you insist,
here's what I would say

04:48.917 --> 04:51.784
about the dishes
if I were Lily's husband.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.418
Barney, you're home!

04:59.284 --> 05:01.450
Dude... Get to the point!

05:01.450 --> 05:02.550
All right.

05:02.550 --> 05:04.684
Thanks, doll.

05:07.984 --> 05:10.151
Sweetie, are you
going to wash that?

05:10.151 --> 05:12.384
I'm glad you bring that up. No.

05:12.384 --> 05:13.917
And here's why.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.951
Lily, I know you don't
like a dirty sink.

05:19.951 --> 05:22.017
But does that make it my job
to keep it clean?

05:22.017 --> 05:23.017
I mean, if one day

05:23.017 --> 05:25.017
I look up
at the living room ceiling

05:25.017 --> 05:26.650
and think,
"Hey, I'd like a replica

05:26.650 --> 05:27.984
of the Sistine Chapel up there."

05:27.984 --> 05:29.517
Would it be your job
to paint it?

05:29.517 --> 05:31.381
Well, no.
Of course not.

05:32.381 --> 05:34.251
Exactly! So, baby,
by the same logic,

05:34.251 --> 05:36.784
if you don't like looking
at a sink full of dishes,

05:36.785 --> 05:38.985
Shouldn't it be your job to clean them?

05:39.684 --> 05:41.484
Wow. Thanks for
explaining that.

05:41.484 --> 05:43.384
I get so confused.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.251
That's because
you're a woman.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.384
I don't even know
why we're laughing!

05:49.384 --> 05:51.151
Of course you don't.

05:54.517 --> 05:56.217
You're kidding me with this.

05:56.217 --> 05:57.217
Hang on, Ted.

05:57.217 --> 05:58.750
Let's hear the man out.

05:58.750 --> 06:00.650
Once I have her attention,

06:00.650 --> 06:03.318
it's time
to bring out the big guns.

06:03.318 --> 06:05.917
Look, I love you.

06:05.917 --> 06:09.418
But, baby, with the little
energy I have left after work,

06:09.418 --> 06:11.750
I want to shower you with love,

06:11.750 --> 06:14.084
not wash some silly dishes.

06:14.084 --> 06:17.051
You're right.
I'll do the dishes.

06:17.051 --> 06:19.884
Right after I do this.

06:23.151 --> 06:25.684
Oh, yeah.

06:25.684 --> 06:26.850
Now turn around.

06:30.450 --> 06:32.318
Firm.

06:32.318 --> 06:33.517
Oh, yeah.

06:33.517 --> 06:35.184
Are you going to
hit him or should I?

06:35.184 --> 06:36.418
He's right.

06:36.418 --> 06:39.483
No, he's not.
Marshall, look at me.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.850
Do not get drawn into
Barney Stinson's circus tent

06:41.850 --> 06:43.550
of funhouse mirrors
and flawed logic.

06:43.950 --> 06:46.451
This is exactly how you got
the earring back in '03.

06:46.451 --> 06:47.651
Hey, that earring looked cool.

06:47.651 --> 06:49.117
It did look
cool, didn't it?

06:49.117 --> 06:52.084
Marshall, stay with me!
Barney is wrong.

06:53.050 --> 06:54.484
No, he isn't.

06:55.417 --> 06:57.684
I hate doing my
dishes right away.

06:57.684 --> 06:58.883
You just said
you don't mind!

06:58.883 --> 07:00.084
I hate it, Ted!

07:00.084 --> 07:01.117
I hate it

07:01.117 --> 07:02.818
with a boundless,
burning fury!

07:02.818 --> 07:05.684
I hate it, I hate
it, I hate it!

07:05.684 --> 07:06.917
You're welcome.

07:06.917 --> 07:07.883
Hey, guys.

07:07.883 --> 07:09.017
Hey.
Oh, good.

07:09.017 --> 07:10.084
There you are.

07:10.084 --> 07:11.750
You'll tell me the truth.

07:12.150 --> 07:14.318
Barney says
that you two never fight.

07:14.318 --> 07:16.284
Huh. I guess
that's true.

07:16.284 --> 07:17.284
Told ya.

07:17.284 --> 07:19.984
No way.
I love you both,

07:19.984 --> 07:22.117
but you are the two most
emotionally ill-equipped

07:22.117 --> 07:24.017
individuals in the history
of relationships.

07:24.017 --> 07:26.218
You two must have had
at least one fight.

07:26.218 --> 07:28.117
You know what?
We did.

07:28.117 --> 07:29.218
Aha!
ROBIN: Mm-hmm.

07:29.218 --> 07:30.517
There was
one small dispute

07:30.517 --> 07:32.884
about which one of
us was more awesome.

07:32.885 --> 07:34.875
We just called it a tie and had sex.

07:34.884 --> 07:38.517
Speaking of which, I am so glad
we're going skiing this weekend.

07:38.517 --> 07:39.151
I need a break.

07:40.451 --> 07:41.717
The upstairs neighbors
are driving me crazy.

07:41.717 --> 07:43.017
Yeah, it's bad.

07:43.017 --> 07:44.650
I'm gonna say
something to them.

07:44.650 --> 07:45.551
Thank you.
Great.

07:45.551 --> 07:46.650
Okay, we all have

07:46.650 --> 07:48.184
our assignments
for the weekend.

07:48.184 --> 07:49.384
Ted, you're going to stand up
to your neighbors.

07:49.384 --> 07:50.917
Marshall, you're going
to stand up to Lily.

07:50.917 --> 07:53.184
And Robin, I'm gonna need yo
in sort of a crouched position

07:53.184 --> 07:55.284
on the bear-skin rug
at our ski chalet. Ready?

07:55.284 --> 07:56.351
Break!

07:56.351 --> 07:57.650
Bye, guys.Bye.

07:57.650 --> 07:59.317
Have fun.

08:00.484 --> 08:03.284
Barney.

08:03.284 --> 08:05.683
With his crazy, well-
thought-out theories

08:05.683 --> 08:06.850
that probably would work.

08:07.550 --> 08:10.750
Marshall, I'm just gonna
say this one more time.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.550
It's a bad idea.

08:12.550 --> 08:13.350
I think it could work.

08:13.350 --> 08:15.617
Okay, two more times.
It's a bad idea.

08:15.617 --> 08:17.317
Listen, Barney lays out
some logical points

08:17.317 --> 08:18.784
Lily is a
reasonable woman.

08:18.784 --> 08:20.751
I think that if I
explain it to her,

08:20.751 --> 08:22.918
she'll get it and
I'll get my way.

08:22.918 --> 08:24.617
Uh, no.
She'll get mad,

08:24.617 --> 08:26.317
and you'll get
in a huge fight.

08:26.317 --> 08:27.884
Slap bet?
Slap bet.

08:31.950 --> 08:34.484
Baby, could you wash your dishes?

08:34.484 --> 08:37.488
Lily, I'm glad
that you bring that up.

08:42.232 --> 08:43.232
Can I stay here tonight?

08:45.234 --> 08:46.234
Hop it on the sofa, buddy.

08:55.917 --> 08:57.317
The ski bunnies
are back!

08:57.317 --> 08:59.017
(Both laughing)
Hey, guys.

08:59.017 --> 09:00.451
(Smooching loudly)
How was your trip?

09:00.451 --> 09:02.250
So perfect.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.751
We just spent the whole
weekend cuddling by the fire.

09:04.751 --> 09:05.917
No black diamonds,

09:05.917 --> 09:07.818
but a lot of red hearts.
Aw...

09:09.384 --> 09:10.718
Okay, I'm gonna
go unpack.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.584
Hey, you.
Yeah?

09:19.250 --> 09:21.451
Oh, man.

09:21.451 --> 09:23.284
What the hell has
gotten into you two?

09:23.284 --> 09:25.351
When did you become
so nauseating?

09:25.351 --> 09:28.584
Isn't it great
to finally see her fulfilled

09:28.584 --> 09:31.584
emotionally, spiritually
and sexually?

09:31.584 --> 09:34.351
Um, I dated her
for a year.

09:34.351 --> 09:36.017
Yeah.

09:36.017 --> 09:38.117
Anyway,
how was your weekend?

09:38.117 --> 09:40.251
Terrible, and it's all
your fault, okay?

09:40.251 --> 09:42.284
I took your stup advice!

09:43.951 --> 09:46.350
Baby, could you
wash your dishes?

09:46.350 --> 09:49.650
Lily, I'm glad
that you bring that up.

09:50.318 --> 09:53.984
No, and here is why...

10:01.617 --> 10:02.717
Okay.

10:04.350 --> 10:07.717
So, it's like this, okay?

10:07.717 --> 10:10.684
Yeah, sure.
You want me

10:10.684 --> 10:12.850
to go ahead
and wash my dish.

10:12.850 --> 10:14.150
But maybe...

10:14.150 --> 10:16.317
I want you...

10:16.317 --> 10:19.651
to paint
the ceiling, right?

10:19.651 --> 10:20.984
Like, maybe I should say,

10:20.984 --> 10:23.850
"Okay, yeah.
I'll wash my dish

10:23.850 --> 10:25.117
"if you get up there

10:25.117 --> 10:27.984
and just--you paint
naked babies on the ceiling."

10:27.984 --> 10:30.783
You know?
It just like...

10:32.734 --> 10:35.134
I don't know what happened.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.534
I'm a lawyer.

10:36.534 --> 10:37.833
I argue for a living,

10:37.833 --> 10:41.900
but when it comes to Lily,
I just get all... flustered.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.700
How could you not?

10:43.700 --> 10:45.838
I mean, the girl's
all eyes and boobs.

10:46.638 --> 10:49.696
What happened to the "I'm tired
after my draining day,

10:49.697 --> 10:50.997
I want to use my left over energy

10:50.997 --> 10:51.934
showering you
with love" argument?

10:51.934 --> 10:54.967
I should have written that down.

10:56.567 --> 10:57.473
Look, Lily, I...

10:59.008 --> 11:00.434
I make more money than you.

11:00.434 --> 11:01.791
Excuse me?!

11:03.567 --> 11:06.200
Dance for me.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.168
Oh, Marshall.

11:07.168 --> 11:08.333
Dude.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.867
It all made so much sense
when you said it,

11:10.867 --> 11:12.024
but when I said it,
it turned into a fight.

11:12.034 --> 11:13.534
And once Lily and I
start fighting,

11:13.534 --> 11:17.367
the fight starts to mutate
and multiply.

11:18.067 --> 11:20.233
<i>MARSHALL:Sure, it started
with the dishes, but then...</i>

11:20.233 --> 11:23.801
So you're saying that you
shouldn't have to wash dishes

11:23.801 --> 11:25.701
because you work
harder than me?

11:25.701 --> 11:27.701
Okay, that's not
what I'm saying--

11:27.701 --> 11:28.967
but it's true.

11:28.967 --> 11:30.801
<i>And then all of sudden,
we're also fighting</i>

11:30.801 --> 11:31.434
<i>about who works harder.</i>

11:31.435 --> 11:33.435
I teach kindergarten.

11:33.435 --> 11:36.367
I am molding the future
leaders of tomorrow.

11:36.368 --> 11:38.367
You eat cookies and glue stuff.

11:38.367 --> 11:39.901
<i>And soon more fights spinn off.</i>

11:39.901 --> 11:41.400
I can't believe you'd rather
be killed...

11:41.400 --> 11:42.834
<i>Until there are
more fights going on</i>

11:42.834 --> 11:44.434
<i>than you can even
keep track of.</i>

11:44.434 --> 11:46.867
If you need to go in the middle
of the night,

11:46.867 --> 11:49.200
either turn the bathroom
light on or sit down.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.400
My mother
does not hate you.

11:51.400 --> 11:54.467
She is neutral
about you.

11:54.467 --> 11:57.050
<i>I am not scared of
your Shining impression.</i>

11:57.050 --> 12:00.167
I just don't need to hear
it, especially at night.

12:00.167 --> 12:01.868
(Gravelly voice):
Danny's not here,

12:01.868 --> 12:03.333
Mrs. Torrance.

12:03.333 --> 12:06.634
Please don't do that.

12:06.634 --> 12:08.434
Man, Lily fights dirty.

12:08.734 --> 12:12.701
She's small
but vicious like a badger

12:12.701 --> 12:14.667
that your brother's caught
and starved for five days

12:14.667 --> 12:17.500
and then put
in your sleeping bag.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.134
I should just go home
and apologize.

12:19.134 --> 12:22.001
No. What you need
is a surge.

12:22.001 --> 12:23.367
Fight harder.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.901
Picture it, Marshall,

12:25.901 --> 12:28.567
never having to wash another dish
as long as you live,

12:28.567 --> 12:30.734
yet all the dishes
are always clean.

12:30.734 --> 12:33.934
Why, this would take all the anxiety
out of snacking.

12:33.934 --> 12:36.434
No more holding
open your shirt

12:36.434 --> 12:39.634
to form a makeshift bowl
for your salty treats.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.365
That world is
yours, Marshall.

12:41.366 --> 12:42.366
Reach out, take it.

12:43.734 --> 12:47.434
dip it in some
ranch dressing, enjoy.

12:51.000 --> 12:51.501
He's right.

12:51.501 --> 12:52.767
No!

12:52.767 --> 12:53.767
Barney's stupid ideas

12:53.767 --> 12:55.201
are what got you
into this quagmire.

12:55.201 --> 12:57.034
There's no exit strategy.
Just wash your stupid dishes.

12:57.034 --> 12:59.167
No! Those dishes are my manhood!

12:59.167 --> 13:02.067
And if I want to leave my
manhood dirty in the sink,

13:02.067 --> 13:03.367
caked with ketchup and pasta...

13:03.367 --> 13:04.301
What are you eating?

13:04.301 --> 13:06.467
...then damn it,
that's my right!

13:06.467 --> 13:09.668
I'll wash my manhood
when I'm good and ready!

13:09.668 --> 13:11.301
Where was he not sitting?

13:12.950 --> 13:15.284
Hey, Barnstormer.

13:15.284 --> 13:17.750
He Ro-Ro.
Ooh!

13:17.750 --> 13:19.817
Okay, now you have
adorable nicknames?

13:19.817 --> 13:21.984
Seriously, what's going on
with your two?

13:21.984 --> 13:23.618
Nothing. We're just happy.

13:23.618 --> 13:25.184
It's like Gandhi said,

13:25.184 --> 13:27.017
"A smile don't cost nothing, sugar."
Mm-hmm.

13:27.017 --> 13:29.584
I'm not sure you know
who Gandhi is.

13:29.584 --> 13:31.518
So, um, Ted, did you
talk to our neighbors?

13:31.518 --> 13:33.284
Yes, yeah, I did.

13:33.284 --> 13:36.151
I went up there ready
to set them straight.

13:46.884 --> 13:47.917
They're old?

13:47.917 --> 13:49.317
Really old.

13:49.317 --> 13:51.284
So what did you do?

13:51.284 --> 13:53.584
Well, I didn't have the heart
to tell them to stop,

13:53.584 --> 13:54.884
because, well, good for them.

13:54.884 --> 13:56.717
So I just weomed them
to the building,

13:56.717 --> 13:58.017
had a hard candy,

13:58.017 --> 14:01.050
nodded politely at some racist
comments and then left.

14:02.850 --> 14:04.484
<i>Over the next couple of days</i>

14:04.484 --> 14:07.584
<i>Barney and Robin continued
to be happier than ever.</i>

14:07.584 --> 14:09.851
<i>And Marshall and Lily
continued to fight.</i>

14:09.851 --> 14:12.450
I don't care if
the dishes aren't done.

14:12.450 --> 14:14.217
Okay, if you care, you do it.

14:14.217 --> 14:17.617
Great. Then I don't care
if you have an orgasm.

14:17.617 --> 14:19.450
If you care, you do it.

14:19.450 --> 14:22.651
I went 18 years without
the touch of a woman.

14:22.651 --> 14:23.984
I can do it again.

14:23.984 --> 14:25.717
You might have to.

14:25.717 --> 14:28.250
<i>And I continued to hear
more bagpiping</i>

14:28.250 --> 14:31.797
<i>than a St. Patty's Day parade.</i>

14:35.317 --> 14:36.518
I don't know what to do.

14:36.518 --> 14:38.550
Lily and I have never
had a fight this long.

14:38.550 --> 14:39.984
It's like I don't
even exist.

14:39.984 --> 14:43.017
On Sunday morning,
she made pancake, Ted.

14:43.017 --> 14:45.583
Pancake and bacon strip.

14:45.583 --> 14:47.251
It's your own fault.

14:47.251 --> 14:50.217
You took relationship
advice from Barney.

14:50.217 --> 14:53.251
Well, maybe Barney
has it all figured out.

14:53.251 --> 14:56.217
He and Ro-Ro are
the best couple now.

14:56.217 --> 14:58.284
Lily and I have
been dethroned.

14:58.284 --> 14:59.717
You know what,
I'm not buying it.

14:59.717 --> 15:01.451
All that cutesy,
lovey-dovey crap,

15:01.451 --> 15:02.683
that's not them.

15:02.683 --> 15:05.717
And I know for a fact
that Robin hates nicknames.

15:06.984 --> 15:08.384
Thanks, Robbsy-wobbsy.

15:08.384 --> 15:11.217
Yeah, I don't do nicknames.

15:11.217 --> 15:13.583
Finished with the
sports page, Sherbs?

15:13.583 --> 15:15.817
Seriously, stop.

15:16.817 --> 15:18.984
Hey, Robin, it's T-Mose.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.717
Yeah, I don't like them
on you either.

15:22.183 --> 15:24.384
Well, she obviously
likes them now.

15:24.384 --> 15:26.083
And, come on

15:26.083 --> 15:28.484
somebody had to put
an end to T-Mose.

15:28.484 --> 15:31.317
No, T-Mose was awesome.

15:31.317 --> 15:33.717
I'm thinking
of bringing it back.

15:35.183 --> 15:38.117
Bagpiping sounds
a little different today.

15:38.117 --> 15:39.951
It's all echo-y.

15:39.951 --> 15:41.384
Yeah. They're
in the bathroom.

15:41.384 --> 15:44.384
I think they're bagpiping
on the shower chair.

15:44.384 --> 15:46.418
<i>And just like that, I realized</i>

15:46.418 --> 15:49.151
<i>exactly how to get the real
scoop on Barney and Robin.</i>

15:49.151 --> 15:51.251
Oh, hey, Ted.
How are Marshall and Lily?

15:51.251 --> 15:53.351
I worry about those two,
I really do.

15:53.351 --> 15:54.984
You and your
big, giant heart.

15:54.984 --> 15:57.817
Okay, enough.
The jig is up.

15:58.817 --> 16:00.917
Ted, whatever do you mean?

16:01.417 --> 16:02.417
Who's this guy?

16:02.417 --> 16:03.717
We'll get to that.

16:03.717 --> 16:05.617
You see, I knew
something was wrong.

16:05.617 --> 16:09.711
You two were too happy,
too shiny, too nickname-y.

16:09.746 --> 16:10.742
Didn't add up.

16:10.742 --> 16:12.282
You two never fight?

16:12.282 --> 16:13.481
Horse apples.

16:14.112 --> 16:18.323
You fight all... the... time.

16:19.323 --> 16:20.500
How would you know that?

16:21.051 --> 16:22.501
Phil told me.

16:22.784 --> 16:23.947
Who the hell is Phil?

16:24.182 --> 16:25.812
Your downstairs neighbor.

16:25.847 --> 16:29.546
Hi. I'm Phil. 12-B.

16:29.547 --> 16:32.547
And he's heard everything.

16:37.217 --> 16:39.184
So Phil tells me that
Ro-Ro and the Barnstormer

16:39.184 --> 16:41.483
have been
fighting... a lot.

16:41.483 --> 16:42.951
Care to explain?

16:46.550 --> 16:50.517
Okay. Everything
was going great.

16:50.517 --> 16:53.251
Our no-fighting techniques
were working perfectly

16:53.251 --> 16:56.051
until we went on that ski trip
last weekend.

16:56.051 --> 16:59.750
So I showed Marshall
that Lily's argument was bananas

16:59.750 --> 17:02.284
and now he'll never have
to wash another dish.

17:02.284 --> 17:03.717
High two.

17:03.717 --> 17:05.084
That's terrible advice.

17:05.084 --> 17:07.417
You agree with Lily?

17:07.417 --> 17:08.617
You...

17:11.849 --> 17:14.951
<i>BARNEY: Oh, no.
We're about to get in a fight,</i>

17:14.951 --> 17:16.151
<i>and I can't run away.</i>

17:16.151 --> 17:18.318
<i>ROBIN:
I can't take my clothes off.</i>

17:18.318 --> 17:20.351
<i>It's freezing up here.
I get hypothermia.</i>

17:20.351 --> 17:23.517
<i>Maybe I can jump it?
Maybe just my pants?</i>

17:25.983 --> 17:30.151
This no-fighting thing is over, huh?
I think so.

17:32.151 --> 17:34.384
How could you possibly agree with Lily?!
I can't believe that you made Lily get in a fight about this!

17:34.384 --> 17:35.750
She's shorter than him!

17:36.050 --> 17:37.783
And it didn't end there.

17:37.783 --> 17:38.850
We've been fighting
ever since.

17:38.850 --> 17:41.217
All those fights we
kept not having--

17:41.217 --> 17:42.618
they all came back around.

17:42.619 --> 17:43.618
The bag of panties...

17:43.618 --> 17:45.084
The tie Robin murdered.

17:45.184 --> 17:46.951
The tiny camera I
found in the headboard.

17:46.951 --> 17:50.284
That's how a
quarterback stays sharp.

17:50.284 --> 17:51.984
Monday morning, he sits
on a bag of ice

17:51.984 --> 17:53.984
and studies the game tape.
Barney for the millionth time...

17:53.984 --> 17:56.451
You don't get to be as good as I am...
using football analogies...

17:54.884 --> 17:58.279
Whoo, yeah!

17:56.451 --> 17:57.783
Without reviewing the fundamentals

17:57.783 --> 17:58.384
and studying technique!
Does not make it any less creepy.

17:58.384 --> 18:02.217
I knew it! I knew you guys were acting
too cute and perfect!

18:02.217 --> 18:05.517
Look, we were just sick
of everyone pointing out

18:05.517 --> 18:07.284
how crappy at
relationships we both are.

18:07.284 --> 18:10.417
Yeah, it was sort of nice
to be the perfect couple for a minute.

18:10.417 --> 18:11.984
TED:
I knew you were lying.

18:11.984 --> 18:15.251
You got to wake up pretty early
to slip one by the T-Mose.

18:15.251 --> 18:16.017
Stop it.

18:18.017 --> 18:20.651
LILY (singsong voice):
Marshall, dinner's ready.

18:20.651 --> 18:23.351
Did you-- did you make
any for me?

18:23.351 --> 18:26.017
No, but it's
your favorite.

18:33.017 --> 18:34.917
(Sighing):
Hey.

18:35.917 --> 18:37.917
We need your advice.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.917
<i>NARRATOR:
So Barney and Robin told Lily and Marshall</i>

18:39.917 --> 18:41.150
<i>all about their fighting.</i>

18:41.150 --> 18:42.484
<i>And let's just say,
that in comparison,</i>

18:42.484 --> 18:44.518
<i>their little dishes spat
seemed pretty tame.</i>

18:55.284 --> 18:56.618
<i>And by the end,</i>

18:56.618 --> 18:58.984
<i>Lily and Marshall
both had the same reaction.</i>

18:58.984 --> 19:02.117
I'll wash my dishes right away
from now until the day I die.

19:02.117 --> 19:03.484
I don't care when
you wash the dishes.

19:03.484 --> 19:06.850
But if it's something
cheese-based like a nice ziti,

19:06.850 --> 19:08.884
at least soak it, okay?
Of course, baby.

19:08.884 --> 19:10.050
Oh, I love you.

19:10.050 --> 19:12.683
I love you, too.
ROBIN: See?

19:12.683 --> 19:14.217
Right there,
how did you just do that?

19:14.217 --> 19:15.251
How'd you just
fix everything?

19:15.251 --> 19:16.551
I don't know.

19:16.551 --> 19:19.217
I guess sometimes you just
have to set your ego aside.

19:19.217 --> 19:22.351
Yeah. An-And remember
at the love that you have

19:22.351 --> 19:25.917
for that other person is way
more important than winning.

19:30.584 --> 19:32.650
More important
than winning

19:32.650 --> 19:34.084
Stop, stop it.

19:34.084 --> 19:36.050
Seriously,
what's the secret?

19:36.050 --> 19:39.650
Okay, look, the honeymoon period
may be over,

19:39.650 --> 19:42.984
but now you can get
into the real stuff.

19:42.984 --> 19:44.217
And honestly,

19:44.217 --> 19:46.317
that's the best part.

19:46.817 --> 19:47.917
Good night.

19:47.917 --> 19:50.084
So what do
we do now?

19:50.084 --> 19:52.018
I guess we got to
start talking more

19:52.018 --> 19:53.250
and get into
the real stuff.

19:53.250 --> 19:54.684
Yeah.

19:54.684 --> 19:56.183
Or there's a bench
in the elevator.

19:56.183 --> 19:57.550
Ooh, that's better.
Mm-hmm.

19:57.550 --> 19:59.851
Hey, so what if we're not
the best couple in the world?

19:59.851 --> 20:02.317
Totally. It's not a competition.
No.

20:02.317 --> 20:03.350
We win!

20:03.350 --> 20:04.984
Best couple in the world!

20:04.984 --> 20:08.379
Whoo, yeah!

20:09.617 --> 20:10.884
Guess what?

20:10.884 --> 20:11.984
These glasses

20:11.984 --> 20:13.651
are plastic.

20:13.651 --> 20:15.784
So we can just
throw them away.

20:15.784 --> 20:18.450
That means no dirty
dishes in the sink.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.517
Mm, you're dirty.

20:20.517 --> 20:22.784
Maybe I should leave
you in the sink.

20:25.184 --> 20:27.884
<i>NARRATOR: And once that first
argument got worked out,</i>

20:27.884 --> 20:29.251
<i>all those other arguments,</i>

20:29.251 --> 20:32.850
<i>well, they got better, too.</i>
