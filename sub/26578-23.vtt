WEBVTT

00:00.296 --> 00:02.375
Great dinner as usual, Mom.

00:02.400 --> 00:04.148
Great sucking up as usual, Frank.

00:04.173 --> 00:05.740
Thank you for inviting me, Mrs. Cleary.

00:05.765 --> 00:07.340
Oh, "Mrs. Cleary."

00:07.372 --> 00:09.910
After all this time, I'm surprised
you don't call me Peggy.

00:09.943 --> 00:12.086
- Oh, well, that would actually be...
- It's a test.

00:12.110 --> 00:13.412
...inappropriate, Mrs. Cleary.

00:13.446 --> 00:15.407
It <i> is</i> more respectful.

00:15.948 --> 00:17.584
Is there any more Hamburger Helper?

00:17.617 --> 00:18.946
I got the last of it.

00:18.971 --> 00:20.695
With just a quarter pound of hamburger,

00:20.719 --> 00:21.922
it can only help so much.

00:21.954 --> 00:24.615
There's still lots of that green
bean thing Wendi brought.

00:24.640 --> 00:25.887
What'd you call it again?

00:25.912 --> 00:27.397
- Green beans.
- Mm.

00:27.422 --> 00:28.762
I picked them fresh from our garden.

00:28.794 --> 00:30.430
So, they were in the ground?

00:30.463 --> 00:31.832
Like dead people?

00:31.864 --> 00:33.209
All vegetables have been in the ground.

00:33.233 --> 00:34.968
There's usually a can in between.

00:35.001 --> 00:36.202
It's kind of like a buffer.

00:36.236 --> 00:38.370
Be nice. This is obviously something

00:38.404 --> 00:40.201
that for some reason
Wendi thought we would enjoy.

00:40.226 --> 00:42.108
- Frank, eat some.
- You got it, Mom!

00:42.141 --> 00:43.141
Pass the ketchup.

00:44.577 --> 00:46.546
Eddie got us tickets
for the Laserium show tonight

00:46.578 --> 00:47.713
at the Griffith Observatory.

00:47.746 --> 00:49.682
Laserium? What's that entail?

00:49.715 --> 00:51.050
You learn all about lasers.

00:51.084 --> 00:53.185
It's... It's a very educational program.

00:53.218 --> 00:55.120
I've heard
it's a real hands-on experience.

00:55.154 --> 00:57.523
Kids in the dark, groping for knowledge.

00:57.556 --> 00:58.691
What kind of lasers?

00:58.724 --> 01:00.660
Solid-state? Chemical? Metal-vapor?

01:00.693 --> 01:03.530
I'd say chemicals and vapors
are definitely involved.

01:03.562 --> 01:05.506
You should take your dad instead.

01:05.530 --> 01:06.800
Lasers are right up his alley.

01:06.833 --> 01:08.501
Oh, I don't mind learning about lasers.

01:08.533 --> 01:10.246
Oh, you don't have to act
interested in something

01:10.270 --> 01:11.571
just for a man.

01:11.604 --> 01:12.873
You're a liberated woman.

01:12.905 --> 01:14.074
You and I can stay in

01:14.107 --> 01:15.709
and work on that poncho
we're crocheting.

01:15.741 --> 01:18.310
"Mannix" is a rerun,
so my schedule's clear.

01:18.343 --> 01:20.346
- Great.
- Great.

01:20.379 --> 01:22.182
We're missing somebody. Where's Timmy?

01:22.214 --> 01:24.383
He's in the bathroom
doing his puppet's hair.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.729
Why do I ask "where's Timmy?"
when I always hate the answer?

01:26.753 --> 01:28.429
- ♪<i> I feel pretty</i> ♪
- Sorry those kids at the party...

01:28.453 --> 01:30.199
- ♪<i> Oh, so pretty</i> ♪
- ...threw cake at you, Knuckles.

01:30.223 --> 01:31.566
- ♪<i> That the city should give me ♪</i>
- If it makes you feel any better...

01:31.590 --> 01:32.902
- ♪<i> Its key</i> ♪
- ...they were aiming for me.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.327
♪ <i>A committee</i> ♪

01:34.360 --> 01:37.197
♪ <i>Should be organized to honor me</i> ♪

01:37.229 --> 01:39.375
♪ <i>La-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la</i> ♪

01:39.399 --> 01:40.500
♪ <i>I feel dizzy</i> ♪

01:42.155 --> 01:43.946
- Sorry!
- Oh, for Heaven's sakes.

01:43.970 --> 01:45.538
It's a fuse. I'll be right back.

01:45.571 --> 01:49.542
And I know exactly
how much food was on my plate.

01:51.521 --> 01:53.956
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

01:53.981 --> 01:55.916
So, we're doing this.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.584
We're moving in together.

01:57.616 --> 01:59.785
A bold step for the seminarian,

01:59.819 --> 02:03.056
living in sin with
a sophisticated older woman.

02:03.089 --> 02:04.791
I don't think of it as living in sin.

02:04.824 --> 02:06.426
Well, don't ruin it for me, bucko.

02:06.458 --> 02:08.092
Are you sure you're ready for this?

02:08.127 --> 02:09.696
You've never lived with anyone before.

02:09.728 --> 02:10.940
I've lived with seven brothers.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.565
It'll be just like that, you know?

02:12.597 --> 02:14.075
A lot of wrestling in our underpants.

02:14.099 --> 02:15.634
Maybe you <i> are</i> ready.

02:15.668 --> 02:17.137
I guess all that's left

02:17.169 --> 02:19.104
is to go inside and tell your mother.

02:19.138 --> 02:20.974
Whoa, okay.

02:21.007 --> 02:22.136
Hang on.

02:22.161 --> 02:23.917
Yeah, I like everything about that plan

02:23.942 --> 02:26.534
except by mom meeting you
or knowing you exist.

02:26.559 --> 02:27.573
Our best chance is

02:27.598 --> 02:29.591
keeping my mom in the dark
until I'm all moved in

02:29.615 --> 02:31.051
so she can't foil our plans.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.986
You make her sound like some
diabolical "Batman" villain.

02:34.019 --> 02:35.721
More like the villain's
judgmental mother

02:35.754 --> 02:36.889
who made him that way.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.334
Look, you're just gonna have to trust me

02:38.358 --> 02:40.259
on how to handle Peggy Cleary...

02:41.593 --> 02:44.096
...A.K.A. "The Meddler."

02:44.129 --> 02:45.331
And what would you do

02:45.365 --> 02:46.642
if I just walked up,
knocked on the door,

02:46.666 --> 02:47.934
and introduced myself?

02:47.966 --> 02:49.601
I'd tell you to say hi to the Clausons.

02:49.634 --> 02:52.004
That's who lives here.
We live a block over.

02:52.037 --> 02:54.673
I've dropped you off
at this house dozens of times.

02:54.706 --> 02:56.108
I've seen you go inside.

02:56.142 --> 02:57.509
Eh, it was awkward the first time,

02:57.543 --> 02:58.583
but they're a nice couple.

02:58.610 --> 02:59.854
Oh, they're gonna give us an end table.

03:03.983 --> 03:05.485
An end table?

03:07.819 --> 03:09.322
Hello?

03:11.858 --> 03:14.494
Oh, look who's decided
to bless us with his presence.

03:14.526 --> 03:15.971
Are those actual green beans
on the table

03:15.995 --> 03:17.129
or some kind of centerpiece?

03:17.162 --> 03:19.198
Wendi brought them.
They were in the ground.

03:19.232 --> 03:20.333
Like Grandma,

03:20.365 --> 03:21.676
or the chipmunk I tried to dance with.

03:21.700 --> 03:22.807
Eat up.

03:22.832 --> 03:25.047
You need energy for all that
loafing around you do.

03:25.071 --> 03:26.673
I'm working on finding myself.

03:26.705 --> 03:27.840
Check the couch.

03:27.873 --> 03:29.050
That's where I usually find you.

03:29.074 --> 03:31.010
Not after next week, Dad.

03:31.043 --> 03:32.978
I'm starting classes at Pasadena State,

03:33.012 --> 03:35.048
and I've decided
to move closer to campus.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.050
- Congratulations, man.
- Boy-howdy!

03:37.083 --> 03:38.123
I finally have a real bed.

03:38.150 --> 03:39.651
I've been sleeping under this table

03:39.685 --> 03:41.721
for the past three months,
and it is gross.

03:41.746 --> 03:43.089
It's where people drop their gristle.

03:43.114 --> 03:45.657
Hey, I've been sleeping
with Pat for three years

03:45.691 --> 03:48.694
- and there's also gristle.
- I eat in my dreams.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.663
What exactly is the big ta-doo
about Pasadena?

03:50.696 --> 03:52.132
School.

03:52.164 --> 03:53.508
What's the big ta-doo about school?

03:53.532 --> 03:55.300
Learning stuff,

03:55.334 --> 03:57.069
and eventually a degree in psychology.

03:57.103 --> 03:58.071
Uh-huh.

03:58.103 --> 03:59.905
- Psychology?
- Mm-hmm.

03:59.938 --> 04:01.907
That's one way to go.

04:01.941 --> 04:04.510
Pasadena State also has
an excellent program

04:04.543 --> 04:06.145
- in airport operations...
- Mm.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.813
...terminal and tarmac maintenance,

04:07.847 --> 04:09.248
baggage handling.

04:09.281 --> 04:10.249
Might make a good minor.

04:10.282 --> 04:11.684
Of course he's studying psychology

04:11.716 --> 04:13.194
because it's all about
blaming the mother.

04:13.218 --> 04:14.721
Actually, the latest studies suggest

04:14.753 --> 04:16.764
that peers are more important
in a person's development.

04:16.788 --> 04:18.199
Mothers are actually inconsequential

04:18.223 --> 04:19.192
in how their kids turn out.

04:19.225 --> 04:20.392
Uh-oh.

04:22.562 --> 04:24.030
Inconsequential?

04:24.062 --> 04:25.764
Let's focus on the good news.

04:25.798 --> 04:28.114
Our son is ready to leave the nest.

04:28.139 --> 04:29.235
More room for the rest of us

04:29.267 --> 04:31.537
and less pressure
on the Hamburger Helper.

04:31.570 --> 04:33.466
So, I guess I was inconsequential

04:33.491 --> 04:35.434
during 12 hours of labor with you,

04:35.459 --> 04:37.188
or 10 1/2 months of pregnancy
with Frank?

04:37.227 --> 04:38.678
Family record.

04:38.711 --> 04:40.246
Was I inconsequential

04:40.279 --> 04:41.548
when Pat was afraid of the dark

04:41.581 --> 04:44.183
- and I put his crib in the basement?
- I was terrified.

04:44.216 --> 04:45.685
I can't imagine a scenario

04:45.718 --> 04:48.464
in which you would be
inconsequential, Mother.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.034
In fact, your beauty and intelligence

04:50.059 --> 04:52.591
has spoiled me for all other women.

04:52.625 --> 04:56.129
Take it down a notch, Norman Bates.

04:56.161 --> 04:59.913
I found Norman's
unwavering devotion refreshing.

05:04.670 --> 05:07.357
Lawrence's malarkey
about mothers having no influence.

05:07.382 --> 05:09.942
Hogwash. You could literally
wash a hog with it.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.810
Farmers with dirty hogs
could hire Lawrence

05:11.843 --> 05:13.413
to come and say nonsense like that.

05:13.445 --> 05:16.152
As a job, it makes about
as much sense as psychology.

05:17.817 --> 05:18.817
Where you been?

05:19.942 --> 05:22.121
Oh, just down at the crick
catching pollywogs.

05:22.154 --> 05:23.789
Hmm.

05:23.822 --> 05:25.257
The simple joys of childhood.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.127
Looking for something?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.165
Knuckles.

05:29.190 --> 05:30.262
We have a gig tonight,

05:30.295 --> 05:31.740
and I still need to press his trousers.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.233
Oh, your puppet.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.432
I have him right...

05:37.670 --> 05:39.105
Huh.

05:39.137 --> 05:40.906
I must've left him on the plane.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.242
What plane?

05:42.274 --> 05:43.793
The 1:10 out of McCarran.

05:43.818 --> 05:45.239
I came by a couple of tickets

05:45.264 --> 05:47.520
to see Elvis last night
at the Las Vegas Hilton.

05:47.545 --> 05:49.122
Why would you take Knuckles?

05:49.147 --> 05:51.315
<i>Because people with "lap babies"</i>

05:51.349 --> 05:54.152
<i>get early boarding
and their pick of the seats.</i>

05:54.185 --> 05:55.654
<i>Back in 1972,</i>

05:55.686 --> 05:57.565
<i>an airplane had roughly
the same amount of security</i>

05:57.589 --> 05:58.690
<i>as a movie theater.</i>

05:58.722 --> 06:00.391
<i>If you got past the stewardess,</i>

06:00.424 --> 06:02.021
<i>you could probably even
sneak around back</i>

06:02.046 --> 06:03.561
<i>and let your friends in.</i>

06:03.594 --> 06:05.529
But you took him without asking me!

06:05.563 --> 06:07.365
In my defense, I was sure you'd say no.

06:07.397 --> 06:10.502
We have a show in three hours.
I need him!

06:10.534 --> 06:11.935
Do you?

06:11.968 --> 06:15.880
Or is this one of those defining
moments in a performer's career

06:15.907 --> 06:18.008
where an obstacle
gets thrown in your path

06:18.041 --> 06:19.710
and it forces you to raise your game?

06:19.743 --> 06:21.880
Like when the great opera singer
Marcel Marceau

06:21.912 --> 06:23.514
got laryngitis and invented mime?

06:23.548 --> 06:26.017
Mom!!

06:26.049 --> 06:29.186
You went on a jet plane to Las Vegas?

06:29.219 --> 06:31.551
And I know what you're going to ask...

06:31.576 --> 06:33.224
yes, Elvis leaves it all on the stage.

06:33.267 --> 06:35.668
There is a reason
that they call him The King.

06:35.693 --> 06:37.294
- He kidnapped Knuckles.
- In fairness,

06:37.319 --> 06:39.205
I originally wanted to take Baby Andy,

06:39.229 --> 06:40.497
but you're such a good mother,

06:40.531 --> 06:42.008
I figured you'd notice
after a day or so.

06:42.032 --> 06:44.602
I probably would have.

06:44.635 --> 06:47.171
Well, the only question now
is punishment.

06:47.205 --> 06:49.039
Apparently what I do as a mom
is worthless,

06:49.073 --> 06:50.842
so this would mostly be for fun.

06:50.875 --> 06:53.847
Or I can offer
some rather juicy information

06:53.872 --> 06:55.512
about Lawrence and his moving plans.

06:55.546 --> 06:58.324
- Mom's not interested in making any...
- Stop interrupting.

06:58.349 --> 06:59.351
What do you got?

06:59.383 --> 07:01.793
I'll require full immunity
and my record expunged.

07:01.818 --> 07:03.520
Are we forgetting
what he did to Knuckles?

07:03.553 --> 07:05.623
Who's to say what happened to Knuckles?

07:05.657 --> 07:06.690
Maybe Knuckles ran off.

07:06.724 --> 07:07.791
Now you do the same.

07:10.061 --> 07:12.229
- This better be good.
- Have a seat.

07:12.262 --> 07:14.431
I'll make us a couple espressos.

07:14.464 --> 07:16.564
You know how Dad always says

07:16.580 --> 07:18.820
"I have a moving box
with your name on it, mister"?

07:18.845 --> 07:20.816
Not a figure of speech.

07:20.850 --> 07:22.028
He shows me mine all the time.

07:22.052 --> 07:23.953
He gave us each a set when we were born.

07:23.987 --> 07:27.124
Well, isn't this a fine kettle of fish.

07:27.157 --> 07:31.127
Uh-oh. When she says that,
it's almost never about fish.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.528
Mrs. Cleary, is something wrong?

07:32.561 --> 07:35.064
Well, only if it's wrong
being a deceitful son

07:35.098 --> 07:36.576
who says he's moving away
to attend college

07:36.600 --> 07:37.677
when he's really shacking up

07:37.701 --> 07:39.903
with a waitress I've never even met
from McSorley's Tavern.

07:39.936 --> 07:41.338
See? No fish.

07:41.371 --> 07:43.640
Gee, I wonder who told you about
McSorley's Tavern,<i> Joey!</i>

07:43.672 --> 07:45.113
Sorry. I cut a deal.

07:45.146 --> 07:47.084
I was looking at serious time.

07:47.110 --> 07:49.845
You might as well take
these "Frank" boxes, too.

07:49.879 --> 07:51.982
I doubt we'll ever be rid of that one.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.349
Lawrence needs plenty of boxes

07:53.383 --> 07:54.860
to move in with his secret girlfriend.

07:54.884 --> 07:56.352
Now there's a girlfriend.

07:56.386 --> 07:57.754
Mm. Surely you remember Fiona

07:57.787 --> 07:59.165
from that time he never introduced us.

07:59.189 --> 08:01.058
No, but I remember a few minutes ago

08:01.090 --> 08:02.425
before I knew any of this.

08:02.458 --> 08:03.860
That was a good time.

08:03.893 --> 08:04.920
You haven't met her yet

08:04.945 --> 08:07.263
because I wanted our relationship
on a more secure footing

08:07.297 --> 08:08.698
before you started meddling.

08:08.732 --> 08:11.101
I meddle in my sons' relationships?

08:11.134 --> 08:13.869
Eddie, how was
your Laserium date with Dad?

08:13.903 --> 08:14.931
Pretty fun.

08:14.956 --> 08:16.463
We don't get a lot of one-on-one time.

08:16.488 --> 08:19.799
I didn't care for the music...
Emerson, Lake, or Palmer.

08:19.824 --> 08:21.453
Look, I don't want you pulling
the same stuff with Fiona

08:21.477 --> 08:22.412
that I've seen you do to Wendi.

08:22.444 --> 08:23.946
What have I ever done to Wendi

08:23.980 --> 08:26.182
except make her a poncho
and eat her stupid green beans?

08:26.215 --> 08:28.474
- Wendi and I love each other, right?
- Huh?

08:28.499 --> 08:29.576
You want to talk about meddling?

08:29.601 --> 08:31.631
I haven't said word one
about the bonehead she's dating.

08:31.655 --> 08:32.731
And I very much appreciate it.

08:32.755 --> 08:34.124
You only befriended Wendi

08:34.157 --> 08:35.852
so you could bully and dominate her.

08:35.878 --> 08:37.793
- Your mom does not...
- Sweetie, keep still.

08:37.826 --> 08:39.696
Do not denigrate our friendship.

08:39.729 --> 08:41.206
You heard Wendi. She said she loves me.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.798
It is so toxic

08:42.831 --> 08:44.110
the way you're tangled up
in their lives.

08:44.134 --> 08:45.902
Wendi and Eddie and I disagree.

08:45.935 --> 08:47.746
I think we can speak
for ourselves, Mrs. Cleary.

08:47.770 --> 08:50.906
But we'd be happy to do it
in another room.

08:50.940 --> 08:52.909
Yeah, I'm gonna take off, too.

08:52.941 --> 08:54.287
My plan was to move out next week,

08:54.311 --> 08:57.047
but, uh, I'll just go to Fiona's now.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.215
Be my guest.

08:59.682 --> 09:01.083
Didn't even take his boxes.

09:01.116 --> 09:02.628
Why do I save nice things for these kids

09:02.652 --> 09:03.920
if they don't appreciate them?

09:03.952 --> 09:04.720
They don't appreciate anything...

09:04.754 --> 09:05.956
boxes, mothers.

09:05.989 --> 09:07.590
We're all destined for the ash heap.

09:07.624 --> 09:08.792
I should go fix his wagon.

09:08.825 --> 09:10.560
No. Stop. Peg, back off.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.762
Let him go or you'll drive him away.

09:12.796 --> 09:13.997
It's like when you grab

09:14.029 --> 09:15.273
a big handful of mashed potatoes...

09:15.297 --> 09:16.600
the tighter you squeeze,

09:16.633 --> 09:18.311
the more the potatoes
slip through your fingers.

09:18.335 --> 09:20.366
If you'd buy me a decent masher,
I would have to do that.

09:20.391 --> 09:22.439
- What's your point?
- Look, I'm not crazy about him

09:22.471 --> 09:25.187
shacking up with this Fiona person,
but he's a grown man.

09:25.212 --> 09:26.944
And thanks to us,
he's walking out of here

09:26.969 --> 09:28.110
on his own two feet,

09:28.143 --> 09:29.782
which is a miracle
considering how many times

09:29.815 --> 09:31.936
he mowed the lawn
in those stupid sandals.

09:31.961 --> 09:33.482
You're right.

09:33.515 --> 09:35.651
Those sandals were ridiculous.

09:35.685 --> 09:39.323
And you're right about
how I've been an exemplary mom.

09:39.355 --> 09:40.432
We deserve a little credit.

09:40.456 --> 09:42.256
We saved Lawrence's life a million times

09:42.281 --> 09:44.256
if you consider all the times
we wanted to kill him and didn't.

09:44.281 --> 09:46.362
Well, I can't disagree with you.

09:46.395 --> 09:47.496
I've been great.

09:47.529 --> 09:49.465
You and I got one of our little birdies

09:49.499 --> 09:50.634
- out of the nest.
- Mm.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.336
We need to savor the accomplishment.

09:52.369 --> 09:55.037
We need to celebrate letting go.

09:55.071 --> 09:56.973
You know, there's this
Irish-themed restaurant

09:57.005 --> 09:58.316
I've been wanting to try.

09:58.340 --> 10:00.143
We go to McDonald's all the time.

10:00.176 --> 10:01.445
But I'm in.

10:01.478 --> 10:02.721
Let me go put my loose pants on.

10:02.745 --> 10:04.447
No, this is a tavern I heard about.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.649
Um, McSorley's, I think.

10:06.682 --> 10:07.951
We can check it out.

10:07.984 --> 10:09.853
Um, but if the food's bad,

10:09.885 --> 10:12.489
we're swinging by the Golden Arches.

10:12.522 --> 10:13.657
Mm.

10:17.046 --> 10:20.064
Why did the boy
throw his clock out the window?

10:20.097 --> 10:23.140
Because he wanted to see time fly.

10:23.166 --> 10:25.035
What's black and white

10:25.067 --> 10:26.970
and red all over?

10:27.003 --> 10:29.739
That skunk that got squished
in front of our house.

10:29.773 --> 10:31.240
You're not supposed to talk!

10:31.273 --> 10:33.210
Maybe this is why Knuckles ran away.

10:33.243 --> 10:35.479
I got your boy Knuckles back
from the airline.

10:35.512 --> 10:36.912
Oh, thank God!

10:36.946 --> 10:38.490
Yeah, stayed in touch
with one of the stews.

10:38.514 --> 10:39.514
Rhonda made it happen.

10:40.215 --> 10:41.751
Welcome home, Knuckles!

10:41.784 --> 10:43.386
- Whoa.
- Who's that?

10:43.419 --> 10:45.388
Do you live in a cave?

10:45.422 --> 10:46.989
This is Lester,

10:47.023 --> 10:50.326
one of the most renowned talents
in all of ventriloquism.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.770
Knuckles is gonna be devastated

10:51.795 --> 10:53.230
he wasn't here to meet him.

10:53.263 --> 10:55.197
<i>The comedy team
of Willie Tyler and Lester</i>

10:55.230 --> 10:57.371
<i>were one of the reasons
I got into ventriloquism.</i>

10:57.396 --> 10:59.090
<i>Also, no girls liked me.</i>

10:59.115 --> 11:00.603
<i>So, why are your eyes so big?</i>

11:00.637 --> 11:03.440
<i>Man, if you jumped on a bicycle
and the seat wasn't there,</i>

11:03.472 --> 11:04.582
<i>your eyes would be big, too.</i>

11:06.109 --> 11:09.433
Oh, ventriloquism
will make me popular for sure.

11:09.458 --> 11:10.780
<i>It did not.</i>

11:10.813 --> 11:13.331
Two ventriloquism puppets
on the same flight.

11:13.356 --> 11:14.518
I mean, what are the odds?

11:14.551 --> 11:15.808
What do I do now?

11:15.833 --> 11:17.387
I have a big show in an hour.

11:17.419 --> 11:19.255
I believe <i> he's</i> free.

11:20.557 --> 11:22.057
No, I couldn't.

11:22.090 --> 11:24.260
Lester is showbiz royalty.

11:24.293 --> 11:27.029
He's built from pieces of
the Atlantic City Boardwalk.

11:27.062 --> 11:28.631
You know you want to.

11:28.664 --> 11:30.132
Go ahead, Timmy.

11:30.166 --> 11:32.436
Put your hand in him
and take him for a spin.

11:34.137 --> 11:35.739
Say, Lester...

11:35.772 --> 11:37.474
What, turkey?

11:37.507 --> 11:39.709
What did you eat for Thanksgiving?

11:39.741 --> 11:42.912
A turkey, you jive turkey.

11:42.946 --> 11:45.816
<i>Even in 1972, this was a huge mistake.</i>

11:45.849 --> 11:47.717
Mm. Wow.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.785
This place is pretty swanky.

11:49.818 --> 11:52.455
Cloth napkins and candles on the tables.

11:52.489 --> 11:54.958
Well, soak in all the ambiance, honey.

11:54.990 --> 11:56.681
They pass that cost along in the...

11:56.706 --> 11:58.295
Holy Toledo.

11:58.327 --> 12:00.329
40 cents for a soda.

12:00.363 --> 12:01.639
Maybe they'll knock something off

12:01.663 --> 12:02.898
if we blow out the candle.

12:02.932 --> 12:04.134
Relax, I'm taking the candle.

12:04.167 --> 12:06.069
We escaped our kids for one night,

12:06.101 --> 12:07.386
I say we splurge.

12:07.411 --> 12:08.683
Oh.

12:08.708 --> 12:10.307
The onion soup is French.

12:10.340 --> 12:13.576
You feeling better about
Lawrence and this Fiona?

12:13.610 --> 12:17.410
Well, I suppose we'll just
have to meet this mystery girl

12:17.435 --> 12:18.520
when he's ready.

12:18.545 --> 12:20.411
Welcome to McSorley's. Are you ready?

12:20.436 --> 12:22.518
Yes.

12:22.552 --> 12:24.687
Yes, I am.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.921
I'm not usually a fish guy,

12:26.946 --> 12:29.118
but with all the breading and the sauce,

12:29.157 --> 12:30.429
you hardly taste it.

12:30.454 --> 12:32.963
- I got you more tartar sauce.
- Oh, boy.

12:32.995 --> 12:34.297
It's just mayo and pickles.

12:34.330 --> 12:36.533
Please, write down the recipe
for my wife.

12:36.566 --> 12:37.968
I got it.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.668
So, how long have you been working here?

12:39.701 --> 12:40.743
Four years.

12:40.768 --> 12:43.606
I think I started the day
they made that batch of tartar sauce.

12:43.639 --> 12:44.975
I am not discouraged.

12:45.008 --> 12:46.877
You're so pretty.

12:46.909 --> 12:48.553
I imagine you get
a lot of men hitting on you.

12:48.577 --> 12:50.513
Believe me, I know.

12:50.547 --> 12:52.648
This comes with a price.

12:52.682 --> 12:55.317
Although a lot of gals are
into the bed-hopping these days,

12:55.350 --> 12:56.352
I would never judge.

12:56.385 --> 12:57.462
How do you feel about promiscuity?

12:57.486 --> 13:00.122
I'm an old-fashioned girl.

13:00.156 --> 13:02.125
I like to meet men
by putting on a nice dress

13:02.158 --> 13:03.502
and tying myself to a railroad track.

13:03.527 --> 13:06.162
Well, enjoy yourself.
I say live-and-let-live.

13:06.195 --> 13:08.174
I must have been
out of the room that day.

13:08.199 --> 13:10.576
I imagine you get
your drinks for free, huh?

13:10.600 --> 13:12.402
You enjoy a little snort
every now and then?

13:12.435 --> 13:13.737
What are you doing, honey?

13:13.769 --> 13:15.704
I'm just saying,
in this festive atmosphere,

13:15.738 --> 13:16.973
it must be pretty tempting

13:17.005 --> 13:18.975
to become a degenerate alcoholic.

13:19.008 --> 13:20.518
Could you give me a hand
over here, Fiona?

13:20.542 --> 13:22.345
Excuse me.

13:22.378 --> 13:24.080
Fiona.

13:26.215 --> 13:28.652
Lawrence's Fiona?

13:28.685 --> 13:31.247
You suckered me into spying
on our son's girlfriend.

13:31.272 --> 13:32.450
Oh, grow up.

13:32.475 --> 13:33.723
You knew who I was when you married me.

13:33.748 --> 13:35.092
Yeah, well, it backfired

13:35.117 --> 13:37.201
because all you found out
was she's a very nice girl

13:37.225 --> 13:39.075
who knows how to keep
the tartar flowing.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.153
You're right.

13:40.178 --> 13:41.664
There's nothing not to like about her.

13:41.697 --> 13:42.898
But I'll find it.

13:42.932 --> 13:44.768
Can I get you anything else?

13:44.801 --> 13:46.278
I was wondering about
your dessert specials

13:46.302 --> 13:47.580
and if you have
any history of mental illness

13:47.604 --> 13:49.205
- in your family.
- We're fine.

13:49.238 --> 13:51.960
Well, it's been a pleasure,
Mr. and Mrs...?

13:51.985 --> 13:53.576
Tartar-son.

13:53.610 --> 13:55.512
Miles and Eleanor Tartarson.

13:55.544 --> 13:57.632
Hopefully we'll see you back here soon,
Miles and Eleanor.

13:57.657 --> 13:58.671
Oh, I doubt it.

13:58.696 --> 14:00.450
We don't get out much,

14:00.483 --> 14:02.085
especially not after this.

14:02.118 --> 14:03.253
I understand.

14:03.286 --> 14:06.129
It happens to all of us as we get older.

14:06.154 --> 14:08.424
Older?

14:08.457 --> 14:09.858
Sweetie, how old are you?

14:09.892 --> 14:12.118
- Eleanor...
- I don't mind.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.196
I'm 43.

14:13.229 --> 14:14.431
You two have a good evening.

14:17.734 --> 14:18.768
Did I hear right?

14:18.801 --> 14:20.141
She's 43?

14:20.166 --> 14:21.541
If she admits it that easily,

14:21.566 --> 14:24.399
she's probably been saying it
for a long time.

14:27.494 --> 14:31.147
I can't get over him dating
a girl... a lady...

14:31.180 --> 14:32.582
43 years old.

14:32.614 --> 14:33.917
Why would he do that?

14:33.950 --> 14:35.226
It's like he's chasing his mother.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.486
I know, it's great.

14:37.519 --> 14:39.489
So much for "inconsequential."

14:39.522 --> 14:41.124
You're okay with that?

14:41.157 --> 14:42.559
It's weird.

14:42.591 --> 14:44.059
It's like Lawrence

14:44.092 --> 14:46.829
is looking for a substitute for you.

14:46.863 --> 14:48.098
Mm. Yep.

14:48.130 --> 14:50.100
'Cause I'm taken.

14:50.133 --> 14:52.067
Not only am I consequential,

14:52.100 --> 14:55.072
I'd say I gave that kid
a pretty serious complex.

14:55.097 --> 14:57.307
Well, we know Frank's gonna be jealous.

14:57.340 --> 14:59.475
You guys can all duke it out over me.

14:59.509 --> 15:02.532
You know, I'm not buying
you're happy with this.

15:02.557 --> 15:04.766
You've been looking for ammunition
to use against this woman,

15:04.791 --> 15:05.893
and now you have it.

15:05.918 --> 15:07.625
She's The Little Old Lady From Pasadena.

15:07.649 --> 15:09.685
Hey, watch yourself.
She's younger than me.

15:09.719 --> 15:11.021
I just meant old for him.

15:11.053 --> 15:12.855
Fine. It's weird.

15:12.888 --> 15:14.923
But when you think about it, Mike,

15:14.956 --> 15:16.759
trying to hold on to your children

15:16.792 --> 15:18.827
is just like grabbing
a fistful of Jell-O...

15:18.860 --> 15:19.928
the more you squeeze it,

15:19.961 --> 15:21.306
the more it slips through your fingers.

15:21.330 --> 15:22.766
Or mashed potatoes.

15:22.798 --> 15:25.701
Sure, Mike. Or mashed potatoes.

15:25.735 --> 15:28.837
I'll just have to let
Lawrence do what he does

15:28.870 --> 15:31.756
because any more meddling
might drive him away forever.

15:31.781 --> 15:34.711
Mom, Dad. It's Lawrence.

15:34.744 --> 15:35.879
Coming.

15:35.903 --> 15:38.023
Wait, I'd better cover up.

15:40.816 --> 15:42.686
Didn't expect to see you here.

15:42.719 --> 15:43.987
If you're staying,

15:44.019 --> 15:45.976
I'm happy to kick Frank out of your bed.

15:46.001 --> 15:47.679
Just a visit.

15:47.704 --> 15:50.225
I felt bad about
how we left things today,

15:50.250 --> 15:52.101
and I came by hoping to heal

15:52.126 --> 15:53.395
some of this negative energy.

15:53.428 --> 15:54.849
Well, a good start would be

15:54.882 --> 15:57.041
not saying stuff like "negative energy."

15:57.066 --> 16:00.570
Well, uh, I've decided
I want you guys to meet Fiona.

16:00.603 --> 16:03.973
We'd enjoy that...
someday in the distant future.

16:04.005 --> 16:06.076
Maybe bring her by for Thanksgiving.

16:06.109 --> 16:07.977
Or we could do it right now.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.379
She's in the kitchen.

16:10.779 --> 16:12.089
How can you expect me

16:12.114 --> 16:13.759
to put together a turkey dinner
at this hour?

16:13.783 --> 16:16.251
- We'll see her in November.
- It will just take a minute, guys.

16:17.887 --> 16:20.079
- W-We'll be right out.
- Mm.

16:21.124 --> 16:22.358
Hey!

16:22.390 --> 16:23.726
The woman might be elderly,

16:23.759 --> 16:25.761
but she's not gonna forget us
from an hour ago.

16:28.597 --> 16:31.166
What if she can't see us?

16:31.200 --> 16:33.612
What are your intentions
regarding my brother?

16:33.637 --> 16:35.127
Isn't it past your bedtime?

16:35.152 --> 16:36.651
Now that I finally have a bed,

16:36.676 --> 16:38.245
I have no interest in giving it back

16:38.270 --> 16:40.862
once Missy here tires of
her pretty little plaything.

16:43.311 --> 16:44.614
Let me guess.

16:44.647 --> 16:46.715
That was Frank.

16:46.749 --> 16:48.127
Yeah.

16:48.151 --> 16:49.186
What's happening now?

16:49.211 --> 16:52.482
Frank's personality
sucked all the light out of the world.

16:52.507 --> 16:53.756
Hey, there.

16:53.781 --> 16:56.693
- Sorry about the lights.
- I think we're out of fuses.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.393
- This could take a while.
- Yeah.

16:58.427 --> 16:59.638
That's the same kind of candle

16:59.662 --> 17:00.396
we have at our restaurant.

17:00.428 --> 17:01.764
You mean this common candle

17:01.797 --> 17:03.398
that's sold practically everywhere?

17:03.432 --> 17:06.603
Uh, Fiona, this is, uh,
probably my mom and my dad.

17:06.635 --> 17:08.069
So nice to probably meet you.

17:08.104 --> 17:09.939
Well, sorry we can't see each other.

17:09.971 --> 17:12.275
We should definitely reschedule
for some other time.

17:12.307 --> 17:14.618
- What are you doing for Thanksgiving?
- Oh, there's an idea.

17:14.643 --> 17:15.944
Come at 3:00, bring a side dish,

17:15.978 --> 17:18.381
maybe some of that tartar sauce.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.647
Damn it.

17:21.616 --> 17:24.153
- Why would you say that?
- Doesn't matter. Power came on.

17:24.186 --> 17:26.089
So now you're blaming the electricity?

17:26.122 --> 17:27.665
Did the electricity say "tartar sauce"?

17:27.690 --> 17:31.326
I rushed to fix that fuse, Dad.

17:31.359 --> 17:33.272
When you have an unmarried
couple on the premises,

17:33.296 --> 17:34.948
you do not want to give them
the cover of darkness.

17:34.973 --> 17:36.499
Thank you, Frank.

17:36.531 --> 17:40.057
- We meet again, Miles and Eleanor.
- What's that?

17:40.082 --> 17:41.946
Your folks came into
the restaurant tonight

17:41.970 --> 17:44.239
pretending to be the Tartarsons.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.842
I'm curious...
if you'd ordered the bratwurst,

17:46.875 --> 17:48.677
would you have been the Mustardsons?

17:48.711 --> 17:50.747
No because that's a fake-sounding name.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.080
So, after everything I said,

17:52.114 --> 17:53.792
you still couldn't stop yourself
from meddling?

17:53.816 --> 17:55.250
Don't give her all the blame.

17:55.284 --> 17:56.586
I couldn't stop her either.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.620
I'm glad you got to see this
for yourself.

17:58.653 --> 18:00.510
My mother's duplicity
is like the Grand Canyon...

18:00.535 --> 18:02.371
people tell you about it,
you can see the pictures,

18:02.396 --> 18:03.457
but there's nothing quite like

18:03.482 --> 18:06.045
standing in front of it
and saying, "Oh, my God."

18:07.063 --> 18:09.432
I'm glad, too, Lawrence.

18:09.464 --> 18:12.334
I finally get to see
how wonderful your parents are.

18:12.367 --> 18:13.302
What?

18:13.336 --> 18:14.871
What?

18:16.538 --> 18:18.641
I think what Fiona is saying

18:18.673 --> 18:21.711
is that I am the Grand Canyon
of wonderfulness.

18:21.743 --> 18:23.712
Thank you. Someone gets it.

18:23.746 --> 18:25.315
Of course your poor mom and dad

18:25.347 --> 18:26.883
had to go to crazy lengths.

18:26.915 --> 18:28.217
What choice did they have?

18:28.250 --> 18:29.818
You didn't even tell them I existed.

18:29.852 --> 18:31.888
I was just trying to protect us.

18:31.921 --> 18:33.770
From what? Your mother's love?

18:33.795 --> 18:35.192
I offer it to all my boys.

18:35.217 --> 18:36.869
Whether they accept it or not
is on them.

18:36.893 --> 18:38.526
With you, it's not love. It's control.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.871
It's about making everything about you.

18:39.895 --> 18:41.630
But it <i> is</i> about me.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.298
It's about me losing my son.

18:43.332 --> 18:46.002
I lost you for a while before
and you came back,

18:46.035 --> 18:48.004
and I realized how important it is to me

18:48.037 --> 18:49.905
having my whole family around me.

18:51.907 --> 18:53.909
I'm just really bad at saying goodbye.

18:53.942 --> 18:57.046
Mom, I'm just gonna be in Pasadena.

18:57.078 --> 18:59.214
Yeah, but I hate that freeway.

18:59.248 --> 19:00.792
Well, then I'll come here all the time.

19:00.816 --> 19:02.384
Okay, but call first.

19:02.418 --> 19:04.508
I guess we'll come back tomorrow

19:04.540 --> 19:06.062
and load some of Lawrence's stuff.

19:06.087 --> 19:08.892
I can get my hands on
some really excellent boxes.

19:08.924 --> 19:10.592
See you soon, Mr. and Mrs. Cleary.

19:10.625 --> 19:12.528
Oh, "Mrs. Cleary."

19:12.560 --> 19:13.906
You sure you don't want
to call me Peggy?

19:13.930 --> 19:15.265
Maybe someday.

19:15.297 --> 19:16.774
Right now, it wouldn't feel respectful.

19:16.798 --> 19:18.100
You hear that, Mike?

19:18.134 --> 19:20.134
From a different generation,
when they had manners.

19:25.441 --> 19:26.942
Come here.

19:32.981 --> 19:34.083
But seriously, call first.

19:34.115 --> 19:37.252
- If we don't pick up, don't come.
- Okay.

19:42.091 --> 19:45.028
We gonna go through this
seven more times?

19:45.060 --> 19:46.728
Maybe four or five.

19:46.761 --> 19:50.066
There's a couple I'll be
happy to see the back of.

19:50.098 --> 19:52.134
Change.

19:52.168 --> 19:53.636
Change.

19:53.669 --> 19:56.038
Back.

19:56.072 --> 19:57.941
Change.

19:57.973 --> 19:59.450
<i>It wasn't the easiest thing
in the world for my mom</i>

19:59.474 --> 20:00.976
<i>to see Lawrence move away,</i>

20:01.009 --> 20:02.612
<i>but it helped that she still had</i>

20:02.644 --> 20:04.446
<i>plenty more sons to dote on.</i>

20:04.480 --> 20:06.649
I can't keep my arms up
much longer, Mom.

20:06.682 --> 20:07.983
My shoulder is throbbing.

20:08.017 --> 20:09.974
Offer it up
to St. Anthony de Bordelaine,

20:10.007 --> 20:11.294
the patron saint of sweaters.

20:11.319 --> 20:13.614
- Change.
- I am standing by if you need me, Mom.

20:13.639 --> 20:14.747
Frank.

20:14.772 --> 20:16.291
Always hovering.

20:16.325 --> 20:17.969
Change.

20:17.993 --> 20:19.033
Wait, wait, wait, go back.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.663
<i>A coffee table.</i>

20:21.697 --> 20:23.433
Holy smokes.

20:23.466 --> 20:24.734
Timmy, get in here!

20:24.767 --> 20:27.437
- This is bananas.
- What?

20:29.137 --> 20:30.472
Oh, my God.

20:30.506 --> 20:34.643
<i>Knuckles, can you speak
any foreign languages?</i>

20:34.676 --> 20:35.978
<i>I can speak Russian.</i>

20:36.011 --> 20:37.813
<i>Give us two words in Russian.</i>

20:37.846 --> 20:39.614
<i>Vodka.</i>

20:39.647 --> 20:40.582
<i>That's only one.</i>

20:40.615 --> 20:41.984
<i>Make it a double.</i>

20:43.685 --> 20:45.454
A double's a kind of a drink

20:45.488 --> 20:47.489
but also means two of something.

20:47.522 --> 20:49.001
<i>Yeah, I saw you running down
the street the other day.</i>

20:49.025 --> 20:51.369
<i>- The strangest thing about this...</i>
- I can't believe Knuckles

20:51.393 --> 20:52.929
gets to work with Willie Tyler.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.262
<i>Why were you running so fast?</i>

20:54.296 --> 20:56.499
Oh, I'm so proud of him.

20:56.531 --> 20:59.634
He doesn't look nervous at all.

20:59.668 --> 21:01.170
Well, now that you know where he is,

21:01.202 --> 21:02.372
you can go and get him back.

21:03.331 --> 21:04.806
<i>Why would you stick
your tongue out at him...</i>

21:04.831 --> 21:06.259
I could, I guess.

21:06.284 --> 21:08.150
<i>I always stick my tongue out...</i>

21:08.175 --> 21:09.811
But no.

21:09.845 --> 21:12.547
I'm not gonna stand in his way.

21:12.580 --> 21:15.384
Knuckles was always
the real talent of the team.

21:15.418 --> 21:17.020
<i>For me and my mom,</i>

21:17.053 --> 21:20.007
<i>the summer of 1972
was a time for letting go.</i>

21:20.039 --> 21:22.798
Fly high, my wooden friend.

21:22.825 --> 21:24.382
Fly high.

21:24.413 --> 21:29.413
