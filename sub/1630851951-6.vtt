rabbit ass mind,

00:05.138 --> 00:06.874
sugar does not belong on grits.

00:06.974 --> 00:08.842

01:18.545 --> 01:19.847

01:19.947 --> 01:23.150
Somebody left the door open.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.960

at random times, if at all.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.336
And when they do,

01:42.436 --> 01:43.604
they try to speed
through the neighborhood

01:43.704 --> 01:45.405
before anybody
can get their trash out.

01:45.506 --> 01:46.807
- Oh, now, that's ridiculous.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.876

02:00.621 --> 02:02.589
Oh, and Mr. Brown, maybe you
can settle this for us.

02:02.689 --> 02:03.624

02:03.724 --> 02:06.660
- What goes in grits,
sugar or salt?

02:06.760 --> 02:09.296

03:20.191 --> 03:21.993

all the things we need done
in the community,

03:22.093 --> 03:23.561

and one of the councilmen
just sat there

03:23.662 --> 03:25.530

staring at me the whole time.
- CORA: Really?

03:25.630 --> 03:27.565

that was Councilman Sams.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.501
Yeah, he ain't changed

03:35.707 --> 03:38.009
that just sat there slumped over
sleep the whole time.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.178

Councilwoman Staples.

03:40.245 --> 03:42.280
You know, she tell everybody
it's Narcolepsy,

03:42.380 --> 03:45.016

that we got
running our community?

03:49.054 --> 03:51.189
- ALL: Yep!
- You know, it was alot better

03:51.289 --> 03:53.391
when, uh, Councilman Kirkland
was there.

03:53.491 --> 03:57.195
He at least got new buses,
school buses for the kids.

03:57.262 --> 04:00.432
- So, what happened to him?
- Well, he had to retire,

04:00.532 --> 04:03.101
turns out
he was buying stolen buses

04:03.201 --> 04:05.737
'cuz he used the extra money
to get an ab implant.

04:05.837 --> 04:07.339
- [audience laughing]

04:07.439 --> 04:10.208

He weighed 300 pounds.

04:10.275 --> 04:12.277

04:23.254 --> 04:24.222
and it's been years,

04:24.322 --> 04:26.291

filled his seat.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.926
But it's an upcoming election,

04:28.026 --> 04:29.661
and it's still
no one running for it.

04:29.761 --> 04:30.862
- Well, 300 pounds,

04:30.962 --> 04:32.797
I'm surprised there's a seat
left to be filled.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.100

it was time

05:22.314 --> 05:24.215
to start doing
some extracurricular activities.

05:24.249 --> 05:25.583
You know, colleges look
for that type of stuff

05:25.684 --> 05:27.719
for admission and scholarships.
- LEAH: Mm-hm, they sure do.

05:27.819 --> 05:30.322
- Yeah, well I can
appreciate your initiative,

05:30.422 --> 05:32.557
especially since we blew
your college fund

05:32.657 --> 05:34.092

Nah, I'm just playing,

Okay.
