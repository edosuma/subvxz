NATHAN:
Previously on Haven...

00:02.670 --> 00:04.786
-Duke Crocker.
-This is Evi.

00:04.922 --> 00:06.253
-|'m Duke's...
-Wife?

00:06.340 --> 00:08.672
-I saved your life.
-And then you almost ruined it again.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.374
I do not want you sticking around.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.130
Freakish things happen in this town.

00:13.139 --> 00:15.175
Somebody out there with a tattoo
wants to kill me.

00:16.475 --> 00:19.603
Nathan, when the Chief of Police dies,
people tend to notice.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.097
-Chief.
-Sorry about this Nathan.

00:21.189 --> 00:22.599
There's just no simple answers.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.437
Dad.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.808
My dad was holding it all together.

00:26.944 --> 00:29.560
I understand these people. I can talk to them.

00:29.655 --> 00:32.237
You're troubled,
like many of the people in Haven.

00:32.325 --> 00:34.111
And I can help them.

00:34.202 --> 00:35.658
(BABY CHUCKLING)

00:35.870 --> 00:37.235
Haven PD. Who are you?

00:39.790 --> 00:41.371
Well, you do have my memories.

00:41.459 --> 00:42.949
She thinks she's you. She's not.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.205
-I need to know more about her.
-GARLAND: Lucy Ripley.

00:45.296 --> 00:48.288
-What do you think, she your mother?
-Lucy always helped those in need.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.462
You knew my mother?

00:55.056 --> 00:57.638
MAN: Guys, go get coffee
or something, okay?

00:57.975 --> 00:59.886
Give me some space here.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.395
I hate this boat.

01:06.651 --> 01:08.232
Come on, you hunk ofjunk.

01:08.319 --> 01:11.402
How am I supposed to catch anything
if a load's stuck here?

01:16.661 --> 01:18.822
Come on, you stupid boat!

01:20.498 --> 01:21.988
(METAL CLANGING)

01:22.083 --> 01:23.994
(GEAR WHEEL RATTLING)

01:27.838 --> 01:30.329
I can't believe this. Stupid boat.

01:46.357 --> 01:47.722
(GROANING)

02:11.549 --> 02:12.880
DUKE: So, here it is.

02:13.968 --> 02:16.084
Why the sudden rent reduction?

02:16.220 --> 02:21.806
Ah! You know, I'd just rather rent to a friend.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.971
Especially if she's a cop.

02:25.062 --> 02:29.226
That's a good cover for the crook
you got tending bar downstairs.

02:29.900 --> 02:33.313
You're not as nice as the blond one, are you?

02:38.909 --> 02:41.116
Hey, what's he know about us?

02:41.245 --> 02:42.405
Duke?

02:44.915 --> 02:46.780
Only...only what we know.

02:48.002 --> 02:51.745
That somehow my memories
are really your life.

02:56.469 --> 03:00.883
This reminds me of a lake house
some church let us use when l was 10.

03:00.973 --> 03:04.841
It had those funny wind chimes
with the old forks and spoons.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.141
When I'd have a nightmare...

03:06.270 --> 03:09.433
The sound of the chimes would
make me remember exactly where l was.

03:09.774 --> 03:11.765
But where was I really?

03:15.863 --> 03:19.196
Have you ever heard of Lucy Ripley?

03:20.326 --> 03:21.611
No. Why?

03:23.704 --> 03:24.784
Never mind.

03:29.835 --> 03:33.168
I found something in the book
that we found at Agent Howard's house.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.256
lts latitude and longitude. That's near here.

03:38.344 --> 03:39.459
Yeah.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.636
It's a remote spit of land
about 10 miles up the coast.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.135
No road access. Called Kick'em Jenny Neck.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.386
(PHONE RINGING)

03:46.477 --> 03:48.013
We should check that out.

03:48.646 --> 03:50.477
I knew you'd say that.

03:50.731 --> 03:51.971
Parker.

03:54.318 --> 03:55.649
On my way.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.407
It's gonna...

04:00.908 --> 04:03.490
-lt's gonna have to wait.
-I could go.

04:04.537 --> 04:06.903
Well, you realize that
you can't stop me, right?

04:07.039 --> 04:08.700
We know each other better than sisters.

04:11.168 --> 04:14.706
Okay. Just be careful.

04:18.050 --> 04:21.042
Hey, when you get your wind chimes,
l'd hang them here.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.839
There? Seriously?

04:23.514 --> 04:26.256
Yeah. Maybe we're not that much alike.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.299
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

04:28.394 --> 04:31.807
Well, at least you have somebody
to help you pick an apartment.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.057
Yeah.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.848
Speaking of, when are you gonna move
into your dad's office?

04:37.153 --> 04:39.360
We weren't speaking of that.

04:43.409 --> 04:44.694
Haven PD.

04:44.827 --> 04:45.987
-What's. ..
-Yeah.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.693
I think we've got everything
under control here.

04:47.997 --> 04:50.488
We'll call the Coast Guard
if we need any more help, Officers.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.244
Actually, it's Chief.

04:52.543 --> 04:55.660
You're Garland Wuornos' son.
Sorry he's gone.

04:56.547 --> 04:57.878
You're chief now?

04:58.215 --> 05:00.171
Interim. So, yeah.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.254
Okay, Captain.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.218
Why don't you tell
the interim chief here your story?

05:05.347 --> 05:07.087
Excuse me. Who are you?

05:07.266 --> 05:10.053
Jimmy Halsey.
I own the boat and these three docks.

05:10.186 --> 05:11.926
And the Northeast Marine Corporation.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.394
So you're the one who's doing
all the big renovations around here?

05:14.523 --> 05:16.059
That's correct.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.233
Unfortunately, I haven't upgraded
my fishing crews.

05:19.737 --> 05:22.479
They keep mishandling my equipment,
I'll get rid of them all soon enough.

05:22.573 --> 05:25.235
Oh, yeah?
l'll mishandle you, you motherless scumbag.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.447
-l'd like to see that!
-(MOTOR REWING)

05:26.577 --> 05:28.192
Hey, hey, who's driving that boat?

05:28.621 --> 05:30.077
-What the...
-JlMMY: Whoa!

05:33.209 --> 05:34.244
Nobody.

05:37.046 --> 05:38.377
What's going on?

05:38.797 --> 05:40.628
There's something wrong
with that damn boat!

05:40.758 --> 05:42.089
lt tried to kill me.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.917
So what, now it's just trying to escape?

05:45.095 --> 05:46.426
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

05:48.098 --> 05:49.474
(CHAINS RATTLING)

05:50.935 --> 05:51.970
(SCREAMING) No!

05:59.902 --> 06:01.017
JIMMY: It's a fishing boat,

06:01.111 --> 06:03.727
designed to pull schools of fish
out of the ocean. It's powerful.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.234
Yeah. And it's dangerous.
Itjust killed someone right in front of us.

06:06.325 --> 06:09.408
Fishing boats don't kill people,
they catch fish.

06:10.955 --> 06:14.072
Look, it was a tragic accident, and I'm sorry.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.786
But I need that boat back in operation.

06:15.918 --> 06:20.252
And I need repair records and manifests,
or else that boat isn't going anywhere.

06:24.468 --> 06:25.833
Mr. Halsey.

06:27.137 --> 06:31.506
You are aware that Haven
is a special place, right?

06:32.476 --> 06:34.842
Yes. We have a lovely downtown,
a scenic port,

06:34.979 --> 06:38.938
and the Gulf Stream brings in
the finest fishing on the east coast.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.139
Very special.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.529
Well, Mr. Halsey was no help.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.945
Did you get anything on the captain?

06:51.036 --> 06:53.197
Not much. People liked him.

06:54.999 --> 06:58.833
So we have no motive
and our suspect is a boat.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.206
Let's see if this is her first offense.

07:37.333 --> 07:40.700
Here's everything we could find out
about the Maggie Kelly.

07:41.045 --> 07:44.378
According to the ad
that Halsey used to crew her up,

07:44.506 --> 07:46.497
she's a 55-foot dragger,
750-horsepower Cummins diesel

07:48.719 --> 07:50.050
with a Frigi-Cool system.

07:50.179 --> 07:51.885
Named after a Lobster Princess?

07:52.056 --> 07:53.341
It's a Haven tradition.

07:53.432 --> 07:55.514
Little Maggie Kelly won in '98.

07:55.768 --> 07:59.226
I thought the builder of those boats
stopped production in '94.

08:00.064 --> 08:01.395
He renamed her?

08:02.733 --> 08:04.223
See if the specs in Halsey's ad

08:04.360 --> 08:06.942
match anything from
the Penobscot ship registry.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.569
Wait. What's the big deal
about renaming a boat?

08:09.698 --> 08:11.905
It's just not done. Bad luck.

08:15.371 --> 08:16.406
Oh, dear.

08:17.748 --> 08:18.954
She's the Sea Star.

08:19.083 --> 08:21.449
Well, that explains the rename.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.117
Not to me.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.081
Ten years ago, the Sea Star

08:25.214 --> 08:27.296
got caught in a nor'easter
and sank to the bottom.

08:27.883 --> 08:30.545
Halsey must have floated her, fixed her up.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.423
You can fix a boat that sunk
to the bottom of the ocean?

08:34.264 --> 08:36.596
I know one guy in town who can.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.103
AUDREY 1: So that's all you know
about the Maggie Kelly?

08:40.479 --> 08:42.265
She's a good boat.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.813
Good bones on her. Good motor.

08:45.401 --> 08:47.357
Really scoots for a big girl, you know?

08:47.444 --> 08:49.150
And you never saw anything odd?

08:51.615 --> 08:53.446
There you go, baby.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.407
Gonna run like a dream again.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.735
Louis.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.620
(SIGHS)

09:01.834 --> 09:05.952
Look, he told me everything
was square with the families.

09:06.255 --> 09:07.665
I believed him.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.840
I do a lot of work for Halsey.

09:12.136 --> 09:14.468
-What do you mean?
-The bodies.

09:15.597 --> 09:16.848
What bodies?

09:21.645 --> 09:24.352
When Halsey floated that boat,
there were bodies.

09:24.815 --> 09:27.181
-Still on the boat?
-Still at their posts.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.851
Went down with the ship, every one of them.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.485
Came back up with it, too.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.156
Hey.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.494
-Everything okay?
-Sure, dove.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.990
These officers are just asking
a few questions about a boat.

09:44.626 --> 09:47.083
You really do fix everything, Louis.

09:47.421 --> 09:51.334
You know, I brought this to him
four times before he finally got it.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.674
Now it comes to him with his lunch.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.472
Excuse me.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.261
I'm Marcia Stelzer.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.808
Have you gotten to my note
about the hot stove meeting?

10:04.313 --> 10:07.476
I left a letter at the police station
in that box that your father has set up.

10:09.651 --> 10:10.811
Yeah.

10:11.862 --> 10:15.605
We'll check into that. Just give us a call.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.527
Okay, thank you.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.866
-May we?
-Yeah.

10:23.707 --> 10:27.040
-Hot stoves?
-It's just something my father's...

10:27.211 --> 10:29.702
People used to leave a letter
requesting a meeting.

10:29.838 --> 10:33.456
They'd sit around a hot stove
and talk about some Troubles.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.132
More whining than anything.
I don't want to do it.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.711
I'm not gonna... I'm gonna put a stop to it.

10:38.806 --> 10:42.219
All right, well, a hot stove
isn't gonna solve this.

10:43.227 --> 10:45.183
So bodies still at their posts...

10:45.729 --> 10:47.060
-Ghosts?
-(PHONE BEEPS)

10:47.189 --> 10:50.522
Maybe the old crew,
they wanna be left alone, rest in peace.

10:51.735 --> 10:54.852
Then again, maybe they wanna
drive everyone from port.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.998
-NATHAN: You see what happened here?
-Yeah.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.419
-Curtis is lucky to be alive.
-Did the crane operator do that?

11:12.589 --> 11:16.252
Operator hadn't even clocked in.
That thing moved all by itself.

11:18.011 --> 11:21.674
The ghost crew's on leave now,
attacking sailors inland?

11:22.766 --> 11:25.382
Curtis, can we talk to you?

11:27.604 --> 11:29.265
You ever crew on the Maggie Kelly?

11:29.690 --> 11:31.100
No. Never set foot on her.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.692
So what were you doing at the docks today?

11:32.776 --> 11:35.859
I'm trying to make this place
safer for dock workers,

11:35.946 --> 11:37.937
get better equipment,
new maintenance crews.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.569
Wait. You're a union organizer?

11:41.869 --> 11:45.202
Local 603. lwas working on Captain Robbie.

11:45.581 --> 11:48.618
-Does Jimmy Halsey know about you?
-Oh, yeah. He's a big fan.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.620
I was talking to some men
about new safety equipment.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.292
He came down and started screaming.

11:53.297 --> 11:55.083
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

11:59.136 --> 12:02.219
Halsey was laying into Robbie
right before he was killed, too.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.638
Do you think he's the one
controlling the machines?

12:08.770 --> 12:11.432
He's got motive for both attacks.
He was around them both, too.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.815
Halsey thinks that The Troubles are fake.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.564
Well, maybe he doesn't believe it
'cause he can't control it.

12:22.826 --> 12:25.158
Well, what if we can?
Maybe we could provoke him

12:25.287 --> 12:27.278
and make him turn the machines on us.

12:32.628 --> 12:33.913
HALSEY: You can't close me down.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.414
I talked to my friend at OSHA.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.166
That thing with the crane was operator error.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.748
We can close you down
if you have an endangered plant.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.083
(HALSEY SCOFFS)

12:43.680 --> 12:46.422
-This might be one.
-I think that is. Yeah.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.928
You're gonna shut my port
to investigate some Troubles?

12:49.269 --> 12:50.850
You two are killing this town!

12:50.938 --> 12:53.099

that's doing that.

Mr. Halsey, get out of the way!

They're herding us.

13:27.516 --> 13:30.474

He's not controlling them.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.346
Who is?

13:34.314 --> 13:36.726
Maybe they're controlling themselves.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.385
who would give you a reason to leave Haven.

29:32.521 --> 29:33.931
Well, then, Marcia's in danger.

29:34.023 --> 29:35.559
AUDREY 1: The piano. The puck machine.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.602
Is there anything else
that you would have fixed there?

29:38.778 --> 29:39.893
Oh!

29:45.076 --> 29:46.782
(ENGINE STARTING)

30:08.307 --> 30:11.595

30:13.896 --> 30:15.557
It's okay. I'm here. I'm here.

30:15.648 --> 30:17.058
Please, Louis!

30:27.910 --> 30:29.366
This thing could kill her right now.

30:29.453 --> 30:30.738
-I know.
-So why's it waiting?

30:30.830 --> 30:32.661
Hang in there, Marcia.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.747
It's sending a message.

30:38.421 --> 30:39.752
Parker!

30:41.799 --> 30:45.007
-Louis, ignore her and fix it.
-What?

30:45.261 --> 30:46.717
-Do you wanna save her?
-Yes!

30:46.804 --> 30:48.669
Then you need to keep it happy, all right?

30:48.764 --> 30:50.049
Your machines have killed people.

30:50.141 --> 30:53.258
Louis, what is she talking about?
Please help me.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.263
You need to choose them.

31:06.115 --> 31:09.323
Okay, baby. Okay. I'm gonna fix you all up.

31:09.785 --> 31:10.945
There you go.

31:25.176 --> 31:26.336
There we go.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.175
(MARCIA COUGHING)

31:38.355 --> 31:39.856
Louis! That was crazy!

31:39.982 --> 31:42.018
-Thank you so much!
-AUDREY 1: No, no, no.

31:42.151 --> 31:43.391
You need to stay here.

31:44.487 --> 31:46.227
You need to stay here in Haven.

31:46.489 --> 31:48.354
Let her go to Florida.

31:48.491 --> 31:49.651
Louis!

31:50.659 --> 31:51.819
Louis!

32:09.053 --> 32:10.589
There's a good girl.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.520
You didn't see anything?

32:22.358 --> 32:23.939
No. She just...

32:25.569 --> 32:27.400
Came back like that.

32:38.541 --> 32:40.202
-Hey.
-Hey.

32:43.420 --> 32:44.876
Do you know...

32:44.964 --> 32:46.750
Do you know where you are?

32:49.051 --> 32:50.712
A police station.

32:54.098 --> 32:57.306
Yeah, I figured that one out all by myself.
I should be a detective.

32:57.726 --> 32:58.886
Yeah.

33:03.232 --> 33:05.063
Do you know who you are?

33:05.818 --> 33:08.230
Yes. lam...

33:14.451 --> 33:16.737
lam...

33:21.292 --> 33:23.408
-Oh, God, I...
-It's okay.

33:25.838 --> 33:27.419
I'll tell you.

33:32.094 --> 33:35.632
Your name is Audrey Parker.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.311
You like...

33:42.688 --> 33:45.646
You like matinees in empty theaters

33:47.610 --> 33:49.692
and you hate runny eggs.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.325
What else?

33:58.454 --> 34:00.285
You're an FBI agent.

34:01.665 --> 34:04.998
You became an FBI agent because you felt

34:05.127 --> 34:07.459
that if you could help people,

34:08.714 --> 34:11.797
help people in trouble, that you could...

34:13.469 --> 34:15.630
That you could connect.

34:18.724 --> 34:21.636
I'm sorry. I don't remember any of that.

34:24.313 --> 34:27.476
It's okay. It's okay, 'cause I do.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.065
How?

34:33.239 --> 34:34.945
You're my friend.

34:38.994 --> 34:40.780
We're like sisters.

34:47.211 --> 34:49.122
And what is your name?

34:50.965 --> 34:52.250
My name?

34:53.884 --> 34:55.124
It's...

34:56.095 --> 34:58.302
It's also Audrey.

35:04.645 --> 35:06.101
It's gonna be okay.

35:16.198 --> 35:18.860
It's like the day we found the Colorado Kid.

35:19.827 --> 35:22.113
None of us remember anything.

35:24.206 --> 35:26.322
How are we gonna help her?

35:26.834 --> 35:29.541
We figure out what's really going on.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.626
You know that.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.590
But she needs somebody to take care of her.

35:39.221 --> 35:41.337
I know who we should call.

35:51.692 --> 35:54.308
-Thanks for coming, Brad.
-Of course.

35:54.903 --> 35:58.691
A boater found her about 20 miles south
on a remote beach.

35:58.991 --> 36:00.777
Our doctors say that she's in good health.

36:00.909 --> 36:04.447
She just, she doesn't remember anything.

36:07.291 --> 36:08.622
Go ahead.

36:13.130 --> 36:14.245
Hey.

36:15.466 --> 36:16.706
Audrey.

36:17.051 --> 36:18.916
-Hi.
-How are you feeling?

36:19.470 --> 36:21.586
I came as fast as I could.

36:25.184 --> 36:26.344
Brad?

36:29.188 --> 36:30.348
Yeah.

36:46.622 --> 36:48.863
Let's take you home. Okay?

36:51.960 --> 36:53.120
Home.

36:55.631 --> 36:56.791
Yeah.

37:06.975 --> 37:09.842
You're the first person she's remembered.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.229
She must really care about you.

37:13.482 --> 37:15.347
I care about her, too.

37:27.204 --> 37:28.660
Thank you...

37:31.667 --> 37:32.907
Audrey.

37:52.855 --> 37:54.186
Morning.

37:57.693 --> 38:00.059
How'd it go with your FBI lady?

38:01.071 --> 38:03.027
Did you get your file?

38:06.952 --> 38:08.112
Yep.

38:08.871 --> 38:10.202
All good.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.246
Really?

38:15.127 --> 38:16.207
Uh-huh.

38:16.879 --> 38:18.744
Got it. Destroyed it.

38:19.756 --> 38:21.371
Problem solved.

38:27.723 --> 38:31.261
I stole that from her car
because I thought you were in trouble.

38:32.978 --> 38:35.560
It isn't about Bolivar. You lied.

38:35.731 --> 38:36.720
Evi, listen...

38:36.815 --> 38:40.148
There's nothing in this
for me except helping you.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.485
It's my mistake.

38:58.921 --> 39:01.583
You did the right thing with Audrey.

39:01.924 --> 39:03.255

She can't stay here in Haven.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.424
Ijust wish I could have helped more.

39:10.516 --> 39:11.631
Hey.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.470
You help a lot of people.

39:14.811 --> 39:16.676
Is that why I'm here?

39:17.856 --> 39:19.062
Well...

39:19.149 --> 39:21.105
I gotta figure that out.

39:21.193 --> 39:25.357
The only lead I have on who I am
and where I am from is Haven.

39:26.448 --> 39:29.360
I mean, that's why I ended up here, right?

39:29.660 --> 39:31.696
I just gotta keep looking.

39:32.329 --> 39:33.819
-Parker.
-Huh?

39:34.665 --> 39:36.496
We'll figure it out.

Because it's gone.

39:49.805 --> 39:52.012
Something was there, though.
