10:03.302 --> 10:04.470
- Hm?

10:04.537 --> 10:06.105
- I'm pretending
to be on the phone

10:06.172 --> 10:07.840
so that dad doesn't ask me
to help him in the backyard.

10:07.907 --> 10:09.375
- What's he doing
in the back yard?

10:09.442 --> 10:12.812
- Blasting K-Pop and building
a roller skating rink.

10:12.878 --> 10:15.014
- Wait, is he really building
a roller skating rink?

10:15.081 --> 10:16.916
'Cuz I literally just made
that up as an excuse

10:16.983 --> 10:18.651
{\an5}to get out of work.
- Wow you really just
made that up...

10:18.718 --> 10:20.086
{\an5}- I really did.
- as an excuse
to get out of work

10:20.152 --> 10:22.121
that's so crazy.
- Why are you making fun of me?

10:22.188 --> 10:27.193
I'm just trying to communicate
with my sister. I'm sorry.

10:27.259 --> 10:28.861
- Hey, Henry!

10:28.928 --> 10:31.297
- Piper, wanna
come out back and--

10:31.364 --> 10:33.366
- Uh... like, fifty?

10:33.432 --> 10:36.635
- Ooh sorry, still on the phone.

10:36.702 --> 10:41.407
Hey, Henry -- wanna come
skate with me in the backyard?

10:41.474 --> 10:44.443
{\an5}- I can't believe you actually
made a roller skating rink
in the backyard.

10:44.510 --> 10:46.545
- You better believe it
home-skillet.

10:46.612 --> 10:48.647
Now I just gotta learn
how to dance on skates

10:48.714 --> 10:50.850
and my mid-life crisis
will be over.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.252
- That makes me uncomfortable
so I'm gonna change the subject.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.287
- Please do.

10:55.354 --> 10:58.891
{\an5}- So uh, how did you deal with
mom's mood swings
when she was pregnant?

10:58.958 --> 11:02.828
- Hmmm... As you know, that was
back when I was a Navy Seal...

11:02.895 --> 11:05.097
So I wasn't around much,
which was tough on your mom,

11:05.164 --> 11:06.565
but when I wasn't overseas,
I would--

11:06.632 --> 11:07.767
[ Henry's whiz watch goes off ]

11:07.833 --> 11:09.068
- Uhhhhh hold up
hold up hold up hold up.

11:09.135 --> 11:11.070
I... gotta,
I gotta go to work.

11:11.137 --> 11:12.772
- I thought you
just got back from work.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.340
- I did... but...

11:14.407 --> 11:16.876
- I don't get it. If you just
came home from work

11:16.942 --> 11:18.377
why do you have to turn
around and go right back?

11:18.444 --> 11:19.378
- I'll call you back.

11:19.445 --> 11:20.946
- Because I uh...

11:21.013 --> 11:23.516
- How's it goin'
with the skating rink?

11:23.582 --> 11:26.552
- It's goin'...
"wheelie"-good.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.791
- What a funny joke!

11:31.857 --> 11:33.793
Bring me outside right now
and show me the rink

11:33.859 --> 11:35.528
so I can be very impressed!

11:35.594 --> 11:38.631
- Okay!

11:38.697 --> 11:40.866
- You're welcome.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.306
- Hey, Henry. A couple thieves
are stealing grease

11:47.373 --> 11:49.308
from that restaurant
where they fry everything.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.543
- Fry Me A River?

11:50.609 --> 11:52.912
- No, Grease On Earth.
- Ah.

11:52.978 --> 11:55.481
- You gotta go stop them.
- Okay.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.016
Is that Ray's salad?

11:57.083 --> 11:59.718
- He didn't want it.
And it's a good salad.

11:59.785 --> 12:01.053
Y'know, whenever
I eat healthier,

12:01.120 --> 12:02.788
I just feel so much better
about my--

12:02.855 --> 12:05.691
- I said I didn't want
that salad, Charlotte!

12:05.758 --> 12:09.395
- I know.
That's why I was eating it.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.764
- This place is a mess!

12:11.831 --> 12:13.999
Ooo! Is that a crouton?

12:18.671 --> 12:22.641
- Whoa!
Captain Man got double-c thick.

12:22.708 --> 12:25.211
- For your information I'm not
double-c thick,

12:25.277 --> 12:29.115
I'm capital P-regnant.
- You're pregnant?!

12:29.181 --> 12:31.117
- He ate an alien egg,
it's growing inside of him...

12:31.183 --> 12:33.185
He's being kind of a gunch
about the whole thing.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.454
- What'd you just say about me?
- Hmm?

12:35.521 --> 12:37.423
- Grease heist.
Clock ticking.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.691
- Right. On my way.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.259
- Alright, kid.
I'll meet you ther--

12:40.326 --> 12:41.827
Ahhhh!

12:41.894 --> 12:44.296
- Oh, big guy, you okay?

12:44.363 --> 12:45.898
- Ahh! My stomach's killing me.

12:45.965 --> 12:48.934
I knew I shouldn't have eaten
that stupid salad.

12:49.001 --> 12:52.071
- You ate one floor crouton!

12:52.138 --> 12:55.307
- It's not the floor crouton.

12:55.374 --> 12:57.009
[ gasps ] You're in labor!

12:57.076 --> 12:59.145
You're about to give
alien birth!

12:59.211 --> 13:00.479
- Gaahhh! Ahhh!

13:00.546 --> 13:02.481
- This is amazing.

13:02.548 --> 13:03.916
- Don't look at me!

13:03.983 --> 13:05.551
- Charlotte, get some towels.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.453
Jasper, put on some Cardi B.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.788
We're having an alien baby!

13:09.855 --> 13:13.392
{\an5}- Sorry, kid,
you're gonna have to handle
those thieves by yourself.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.327
- No problem.
I got a great entrance line.

13:15.394 --> 13:17.062
I'm gonna walk
right up to them and say,

13:17.129 --> 13:19.198
"You probably think
you're so--"

13:19.265 --> 13:21.634
- Daaahhhh! Ahhh!

13:21.700 --> 13:24.537
YOU DID THIS TO ME!

13:24.603 --> 13:26.605
- Garlic on the crouton!

13:26.672 --> 13:28.340
- Okay, I'll say it
when I get there.

13:28.407 --> 13:30.609
I gotta run.
- Yeah, just give me two minutes

13:30.676 --> 13:32.611
and I'll be ready to go.

13:32.678 --> 13:34.680
- Go where?
- To Grease On Earth.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.016
It's crime fightin' time!

13:37.082 --> 13:41.687
- No no no no no no no no no.
No.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.289
- Captain Man's
having an alien baby.

13:43.355 --> 13:45.024
You need my help.
- No I do not.

13:45.090 --> 13:46.659
I need you to stay here
and cover for me.

13:46.725 --> 13:48.928
- But I have this great idea
for a crimefighting character.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.396
- You're not coming, Piper.

13:50.462 --> 13:52.264
- I got this viking helmet,
these roller skates,

13:52.331 --> 13:54.233
and this dope hoodie
that says, "Rollin' Thunder."

13:54.300 --> 13:56.068
Guess what
I'm gonna call myself?

13:56.135 --> 13:57.703
- I'm absolutely not gonna guess
what you're gonna call--

13:57.770 --> 14:01.840
- "Rollllllinnnn' Thunderrrrr!"

14:01.907 --> 14:05.578
- I need you to
stayyyyyy herrrrre.

14:05.644 --> 14:08.013
- Ugh, fiiiiine.
- Okay? Promise me?

14:08.080 --> 14:10.916
- Cross my hizzy,
hope to dizzy.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.751
- Hizzy?
That's outdated slang.

14:12.818 --> 14:15.588
You're lying, aren't you?
- Yeah.

14:15.654 --> 14:17.289
- You know what,
fine you can come.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.592
- Let's hit the bricks, doll.
- Now you're lying.

14:19.658 --> 14:21.794
- Yup. Love you byyeeee!
- Oh come o--

14:26.932 --> 14:29.235
- Yup. Yeahhhhh.

14:34.506 --> 14:37.243
- Alright that's enough grease.
We gotta get outta here.

14:37.309 --> 14:40.145
- Hey, we can't leave yet, we
got five more barrels to steal.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.881
- You're goin' too far, Terbert!
You're takin' too many risks!

14:42.948 --> 14:44.516
- We just need this
one last grease heist

14:44.583 --> 14:47.219
and we finally got us enough
money to go to medical school.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.755
- I don't know...
- C'mon, Freddie.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.725
I mean that's why we started
stealing grease to begin with--

14:52.791 --> 14:55.828
to save lives. C'mon.

14:58.497 --> 15:01.834
- You guys must think
you're pretty slick.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.836
- What?
- Yeah what?

15:03.902 --> 15:08.173
- I said...
You guys must think you're

15:08.240 --> 15:10.342
pretty slick!

15:12.111 --> 15:15.281
- We don't get it.
- Are we missing something?

15:15.347 --> 15:19.051
- "Pretty slick."
Because you're stealing grease?

15:19.118 --> 15:21.186
Grease is notoriously slick.

15:21.253 --> 15:24.823
So... yeah.

15:24.890 --> 15:28.327
Maybe you'd care to reevaluate
my wordplay.

15:28.394 --> 15:30.362
- Where's Captain Man?

15:31.563 --> 15:32.665
- He's giving birth.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.166
- What?
- Yeah what?

15:34.233 --> 15:37.169
- I said he's giving birth!
To an alien baby.

15:37.236 --> 15:39.538
But right now,
I'm about to deliver

15:39.605 --> 15:41.707
some justice to you guys.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.076
That's right.
More wordplay.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.478
- ROOOOOOOLLLINNNNNN'
THUNDERRRRRRR!

15:46.545 --> 15:48.213
- Awwwwww, n--

15:51.650 --> 15:53.719
- Thanks. Now they're armed.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.121
- I still got my bat.

15:59.858 --> 16:01.193
[ giggles ]

16:01.260 --> 16:03.395
- Okay, now I don't know
what to do.

16:09.601 --> 16:11.403
- C'mon.
- I want this thing out of me!

16:11.470 --> 16:13.639
I want my body back!
- Okay?

16:13.706 --> 16:15.407
- This is not okay!
Do you hear me?!

16:15.474 --> 16:16.942
- Stop yelling...
- None of this is okay!

16:17.009 --> 16:20.612
- Hit Schwoz.
- Fine I'll hit Schwoz.

16:20.679 --> 16:23.982
Ah, ah! Can't you guys give me
anything for the pain?!

16:24.049 --> 16:25.517
- We tried!

16:25.584 --> 16:29.955
Your densitized skin bent
every needle in the Man Cave.

16:30.022 --> 16:32.491
- Hey I got the gummy-worm
cheeseburger you wanted.

16:32.558 --> 16:33.692
- Oh, thank you, my sweet boy.

16:33.759 --> 16:35.728
- Oh you can't eat that!

16:35.794 --> 16:37.830
- Noooooo!
Wwwwwhhhhhyyyy?!

16:37.896 --> 16:40.766
- Because,
normally this alien baby

16:40.833 --> 16:42.334
would burst out of your stomach.

16:42.401 --> 16:44.036
But since you're
indestructible...

16:44.103 --> 16:48.941
there's only two ways for it to
exit out of your body.

16:49.007 --> 16:52.111
I'm guessing it will
come out of your mouth.

16:52.177 --> 16:55.781
- But... what if it
doesn't come out of his mouth?

16:57.082 --> 16:58.784
- Welllll.....
- I'm outta here.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.419
- No, Charlotte, Charlotte,
please don't leave me

17:00.486 --> 17:02.354
you're the only normal one here!

17:02.421 --> 17:03.822
- Yeah.
That's why I'm leaving!

17:03.889 --> 17:07.159
- No, no! Pleeeeease,
I'll give you a raise.

17:07.226 --> 17:10.095
I'll give you the Man-Copter.
I'll give you whatever you want!

17:10.162 --> 17:14.233
Just tell me what you want
and I'll give it to you!

17:14.299 --> 17:16.935
- I'll take a raise.
- Done!

17:19.471 --> 17:22.473
- I'm outta here too.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.344
- See ya.

17:25.411 --> 17:27.445
- Okay fine.
I'll stay.

17:27.512 --> 17:28.847
- Ahh!

17:28.914 --> 17:31.617
Schwoz, you gotta
get this thing out of me.

17:31.683 --> 17:33.619
I gotta go help Henry!
He could be in trouble...

17:33.685 --> 17:34.853
- I'm sure he's fine.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.656
Now open your mouth
and say "ahh".

17:37.723 --> 17:40.159
- Ahhhhhhh!!!
- Good!

17:42.828 --> 17:45.497
- and then, after we
go to medical school

17:45.564 --> 17:49.067
and, of course, complete a two
to four year residency program.

17:49.134 --> 17:51.537
- Depending on our area
of specialization.

17:51.603 --> 17:52.871
- That's correct.

17:52.938 --> 17:54.373
After that we start
our own practice...

17:54.440 --> 17:55.541
[ groans ]

17:55.607 --> 17:58.343
- Shut uuuuuup!

17:58.410 --> 18:00.279
Do bad guys always talk
this much?

18:00.345 --> 18:02.614
{\an5}- Usually, yeah.
But most of the time
people don't see this part.

18:02.681 --> 18:06.685
- I'm sorry, are we boring you
with this incredibly detailed

18:06.752 --> 18:08.954
explanation of
our ten-year plan?

18:09.021 --> 18:12.257
- Yes!
Zap us or let us go!

18:12.324 --> 18:14.226
- I vote no zapping.

18:14.293 --> 18:17.196
- Either way just stop talking!

18:17.262 --> 18:19.998
- We could get some salads.
Eating healthy feels good.

18:20.065 --> 18:23.202
- No! Okay you are gonna
hear our plan

18:23.268 --> 18:26.438
on streamlining the billing
process for medical insurance,

18:26.505 --> 18:29.141
so strap in sweetheart--
- Oh my god, I can't take this.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.243
Roller KICK! Ahhh!

18:34.646 --> 18:36.014
- What are you doing?!

18:36.081 --> 18:39.318
- I'm trying to kick the laser
out of his hand!

18:39.384 --> 18:43.422
- That's not gonna work!
- Yes it will! I'm helping!

18:43.489 --> 18:45.390
- If you want to kick a laser
out of a guy's hand,

18:45.457 --> 18:47.326
you gotta go like this!

19:09.014 --> 19:11.884
- Rollllllllin' barrrrrellllll!

19:13.919 --> 19:17.589
Sorry, I thought that
would help.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.225
- Stop helping!
- Okay, I'll stop.

19:20.292 --> 19:23.028
- Are you lying?
- Yes.

19:23.095 --> 19:24.663
- That's it.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.227
- Wow.
That was really impressive.

19:55.294 --> 19:57.062
- I know.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.531
- Raaaaaaaaaainin'
thunderrrrrrrr!

19:59.598 --> 20:01.833
- You've got to be
kidding me--

20:04.903 --> 20:08.307
- Come on Terbert,
let's get out of here.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.775
- But all that valuable grease!

20:09.841 --> 20:11.476
- Leave it!
We'll go to dental school!

20:11.543 --> 20:13.912
- Ahhh!

20:18.817 --> 20:21.687
- Well, you can't win 'em all.

20:21.753 --> 20:24.056
- Actually you can
and we usually do.

20:24.122 --> 20:26.491
- Oh, I get it.
Never give up.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.826
Let's go chase those guys!

20:27.893 --> 20:30.262
- No!
- I am having so much fun.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.698
- Piper!
I'm going to chase those guys.

20:32.764 --> 20:33.966
Okay? You're going home.

20:34.032 --> 20:37.402
- Oh come on!
- Just go home. Okay?

20:37.469 --> 20:39.237
I will handle this.

20:39.304 --> 20:43.308
