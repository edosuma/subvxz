WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:05.205
Wow, I did it!

00:05.205 --> 00:07.273
Something is definitely wrong!

00:08.208 --> 00:09.509
Gold?

00:09.509 --> 00:11.478
In a few minutes,
it'll be all mine!

00:13.346 --> 00:16.516
I'm going put an end to
your meddling for good!

00:20.220 --> 00:20.687
 This is the

00:20.687 --> 00:20.987
 This is
the Evergreen Forest.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.992
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:28.128 --> 00:30.463
That is, until Bert
Raccoon wakes up.

00:30.463 --> 00:31.264
Yahoo!

00:43.710 --> 00:45.712
Luckily,
he has some good friends

00:45.712 --> 00:46.846
to help him out.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.589
Life would be simple in
the forest, except for

00:57.957 --> 00:59.592
Cyril Sneer.

01:03.296 --> 01:05.298
And his life would
be simple, except for

01:06.199 --> 01:07.867
the Raccoons!

01:23.750 --> 01:26.853
In the darkest hours of an
Evergreen Forest evening,

01:26.853 --> 01:29.656
Cyril Sneer is dealing in ideas

01:29.656 --> 01:31.458
darker than the night itself.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.493
So then!

01:33.493 --> 01:35.562
We have a deal, Mr. Knox?

01:35.562 --> 01:39.933
Why certainly, Mr. Sneer.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.434
Excellent!

01:41.434 --> 01:45.772
But there are two as yet
undiscussed conditions.

01:46.506 --> 01:47.774
And they are?

01:47.774 --> 01:51.478
Payment
by noon on the 13th.

01:51.478 --> 01:53.279
Heh, no problem.

01:53.279 --> 01:56.716
The second is I want
it entirely in gold.

02:01.154 --> 02:02.622
Gold?

02:02.622 --> 02:06.826
But I have all kinds of
cash, stocks, works of art!

02:06.826 --> 02:09.496
No gold, no deal!

02:09.496 --> 02:10.964
You'll get your gold.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.366
But I want those ink
and paper deliveries

02:13.366 --> 02:15.935
to stop, immediately!

02:15.935 --> 02:19.506
I can see that
deliveries dwindle.

02:19.506 --> 02:20.306
Good, good!

02:21.808 --> 02:24.711
But, until
I see all that gold

02:24.711 --> 02:29.682
by exactly noon on Friday,
I'll do as I please, Mr. Sneer.

02:34.521 --> 02:37.390
It's as good as
sealed, Mr. Knox!

02:39.826 --> 02:43.596
By Friday at noon, I'll
own every single company

02:43.596 --> 02:45.932
that has anything to
do with newspapers!

02:46.799 --> 02:48.835
Then one paper in these parts

02:48.835 --> 02:51.371
will be nothing more
than a bad memory!

02:55.542 --> 02:57.644
There's a saying
in the Evergreen Forest

02:57.644 --> 03:01.314
you get to know almost from
the first day you're there.

03:01.314 --> 03:03.383
"Where there's smoke,

03:03.383 --> 03:05.451
there's Burt Raccoon."

03:05.451 --> 03:07.554
It worked!

03:07.554 --> 03:09.389
Ah, this is fantastic!

03:10.490 --> 03:12.025
Wow!

03:12.025 --> 03:14.194
Hall of Fame, here I come!

03:16.963 --> 03:19.933
Broo, this magic
book is gonna give me

03:19.933 --> 03:22.569
months and months
worth of columns!

03:22.569 --> 03:23.403
For the Standard!

03:26.673 --> 03:29.475
Yes, that's
what they assured me.

03:29.475 --> 03:31.678
We placed that order
over a month ago!

03:32.512 --> 03:34.214
Thank you.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.515
Goodbye.

03:35.515 --> 03:37.417
Something is definitely wrong.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.453
And that's the third
delivery in a row

03:40.453 --> 03:42.088
that's been missed.

03:42.088 --> 03:44.691
What's going on?

03:44.691 --> 03:46.025
Hey, gang!

03:46.025 --> 03:49.329
Have I got something
for you!

03:49.329 --> 03:50.163
Uh...

03:51.664 --> 03:53.366
What's the matter, guys?

03:53.366 --> 03:56.202
Things aren't going
very well, Bert.

03:56.202 --> 04:01.207
Well, maybe my new column
on magic will cheer you up!

04:04.077 --> 04:06.646
It's going to
take magic, Bert.

04:06.646 --> 04:10.416
Because if we don't come up
with a miracle by Friday,

04:10.416 --> 04:12.385
there won't be a column.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.387
The fact is, Bert,

04:14.387 --> 04:17.657
the newspaper is
going out of business.

04:17.657 --> 04:18.491
Wha-

04:18.491 --> 04:20.360
How's that possible?

04:20.360 --> 04:21.494
We're
having trouble getting

04:21.494 --> 04:23.029
paper and ink supplies.

04:23.029 --> 04:27.100
And without those supplies,
we can't print the Standard.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.836
If this keeps up,
Friday's edition

04:29.836 --> 04:33.573
of the Evergreen Standard
will be the last!

04:33.573 --> 04:35.074
What?

04:35.074 --> 04:37.010
That's impossible!

04:37.010 --> 04:39.445
There must be
something we can do!

04:39.445 --> 04:42.815
I think it's time
we took some action!

04:42.815 --> 04:46.786
Schaeffer, let's go get
those supplies ourselves!

04:46.786 --> 04:48.087
And while you're gone,

04:48.087 --> 04:51.291
Sophia and I will
do what we can here.

04:52.892 --> 04:54.594
Come on, Broo, let's go!

04:54.594 --> 04:57.730
We've got work to do.

04:59.999 --> 05:02.235
Front and center!

05:03.803 --> 05:08.141
All of my gold has to
be gathered together
for noon, Friday!

05:08.141 --> 05:10.977
There's a deadline to be met,
and we're going to meet it!

05:10.977 --> 05:11.811
Yes, sir!

05:13.246 --> 05:15.381
Synchronize
your watches!

05:15.381 --> 05:16.849
In three,

05:16.849 --> 05:17.684
two,

05:17.684 --> 05:18.551
one!

05:19.986 --> 05:24.157
Now the next time those Raccoons
yell, "Stop the presses,"

05:24.157 --> 05:25.858
it'll be for good!

05:25.858 --> 05:30.196
Because by noon on the
13th, this deceiving daily

05:30.196 --> 05:33.966
dupes the unwitting
public for the last time!

05:33.966 --> 05:36.936
But sir, they only
print the facts!

05:36.936 --> 05:37.904
Facts?

05:37.904 --> 05:39.138
I'll give you facts!

05:39.138 --> 05:41.674
The life expectancy
of a loud-mouthed pig

05:41.674 --> 05:44.644
is shortened every time
it opens its mouth!

05:44.644 --> 05:45.778
Understand?

05:45.778 --> 05:46.612
Yes, sir!

05:48.147 --> 05:49.716
What now?

05:49.716 --> 05:51.818
Cedric's not going
like this, sir!

05:51.818 --> 05:54.587
Cedric's not going to know!

05:54.587 --> 05:55.788
Is he?

05:55.788 --> 05:56.689
Yes, sir!

05:56.689 --> 05:57.523
I mean-

05:57.523 --> 05:58.458
I mean, no, sir!

05:58.458 --> 06:00.259
Now let's get to work!

06:00.259 --> 06:01.928
Time is running out!

06:01.928 --> 06:02.929
Yes, sir!

06:25.284 --> 06:27.120
That's tough work!

06:29.088 --> 06:30.490
I'll say!

06:30.490 --> 06:32.692
Do you think the boss
will have enough gold?

06:33.559 --> 06:34.861
I don't know.

06:34.861 --> 06:38.331
My total seemed a little low.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.734
If he doesn't, that
newspaper will still be writing

06:41.734 --> 06:44.504
those slanderous
truths about him!

06:44.504 --> 06:47.974
Yeah, he really wants
the Evergreen Standard

06:47.974 --> 06:50.143
out of business!

06:50.143 --> 06:53.045
So we're going
to help him out, guys!

06:53.045 --> 06:54.113
Help him out?

06:54.113 --> 06:55.982
Since he needs gold,

06:55.982 --> 06:57.950
We're going to make him gold!

06:57.950 --> 07:01.187
Enough gold to put every
newspaper in the world

07:02.388 --> 07:04.257
out of business!

07:04.257 --> 07:05.925
Whoopee, gold!

07:05.925 --> 07:06.759
Yeah!

07:07.994 --> 07:09.896
How are we gonna do it?

07:09.896 --> 07:11.764
With the help of this book!

07:11.764 --> 07:14.500
I got it from the "get
rich quick" section

07:14.500 --> 07:16.803
from the boss's library!

07:16.803 --> 07:20.106
It has a chapter on making gold!

07:21.307 --> 07:23.609
A chapter on making gold!

07:23.609 --> 07:24.977
Wow!

07:24.977 --> 07:27.980
That'll really show the
boss what we're made of!

07:27.980 --> 07:30.450
It'd show
him our devotion!

07:30.450 --> 07:33.753
And it might even
earn us a raise!

07:33.753 --> 07:37.957
It says here that to make
a large amount of gold,

07:37.957 --> 07:40.426
you need a small amount of gold.

07:41.594 --> 07:44.430
Gee, where are
we gonna get gold?

07:45.832 --> 07:50.269
The only person around here
with any gold is the boss.

07:51.404 --> 07:51.737
We can't
take the boss's gold!

07:55.975 --> 07:56.809
Can we?

08:00.480 --> 08:03.883
Broo, if the newspaper
can't afford supplies,

08:03.883 --> 08:05.384
we've gotta help them.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.721
But we're gonna need money.

08:08.721 --> 08:11.657
Oh, where are we
gonna get money?

08:13.092 --> 08:14.594
You're right, Broo!

08:14.594 --> 08:18.731
Doing a magic show is just
not thinking big enough!

08:18.731 --> 08:22.935
They've come to expect great
things from Bert Raccoon!

08:28.541 --> 08:30.476
Hey, Broo, wait!

08:30.476 --> 08:32.311
That's exactly the
way to get the money

08:32.311 --> 08:33.846
for the ink and the paper!

08:33.846 --> 08:36.115
The magic formula is right here!

08:38.017 --> 08:38.851
This is it, Broo!

08:40.186 --> 08:44.624
We'll perform the greatest
trick of all time!

08:44.624 --> 08:45.925
We'll make gold!

08:52.031 --> 08:53.633
Six
ounces of snake oil!

08:53.633 --> 08:54.934
Check!

08:54.934 --> 08:56.135
A dab'll do ya!

08:56.135 --> 08:57.370
Check!

08:57.370 --> 08:58.804
A hair from the
dog that bit ya!

08:58.804 --> 09:00.206
Check!

09:00.206 --> 09:01.440
That's it!

09:01.440 --> 09:04.544
Okay,
everything is set.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.480
All we need now,
according to the book,

09:07.480 --> 09:10.850
is a massive amount
of electricity.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.151
Oh, goodie!

09:12.151 --> 09:13.085
Let's do it!

09:14.153 --> 09:15.354
Ready?

09:15.354 --> 09:16.556
Three,

09:16.556 --> 09:17.823
two,

09:17.823 --> 09:19.125
one,

09:19.125 --> 09:20.426
zero!

09:24.130 --> 09:27.066
Hey, what happened?

09:27.066 --> 09:29.969
Must be a power failure.

09:29.969 --> 09:34.040
The lightning outside must've
taken out a few power lines.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.909
Oh, what are we gonna do?

09:36.909 --> 09:40.580
Without electricity,
we can't make our gold!

09:42.815 --> 09:44.383
Wait a minute!

09:44.383 --> 09:46.919
Lightning's electricity!

09:46.919 --> 09:49.221
We'll take the gold out there!

09:49.221 --> 09:52.792
And I think I know
just the place to put it!

09:52.792 --> 09:56.362
It's so high that the
lightning is sure to strike it!

09:57.330 --> 09:58.764
Green's Peak!

10:01.634 --> 10:03.803
Ralph!

10:03.803 --> 10:04.937
Schaeffer!

10:04.937 --> 10:06.205
You're back!

10:06.205 --> 10:08.240
What happened to
the lights, Melissa?

10:08.240 --> 10:10.876
Oh, it's just a power failure.

10:10.876 --> 10:12.612
Did you get any supplies?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.180
No.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.649
In fact, we couldn't even
get anyone to talk to us.

10:16.649 --> 10:18.618
Did you have any luck?

10:18.618 --> 10:21.520
Well, we came
up with something.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.390
We figured that if we cut
the newspaper in half,

10:24.390 --> 10:26.559
we could save on ink and paper.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.661
That's a great idea!

10:28.661 --> 10:31.864
But we'll still need
supplies, and soon.

10:31.864 --> 10:35.234
Or tomorrow will be
our last edition.

10:35.234 --> 10:37.503
Ralph, I just had a thought.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.474
If we gathered up the old
editions of our newspaper,

10:41.474 --> 10:43.576
couldn't we recycle them?

10:43.576 --> 10:45.077
You're right!

10:45.077 --> 10:48.547
And that would make us less
dependent on paper deliveries.

10:48.547 --> 10:50.716
It's a step
in the right direction.

10:50.716 --> 10:52.218
Let's keep thinking.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.619
We're not gonna give up yet!

10:57.690 --> 11:00.426
I wanna make
sure I got this right.

11:00.426 --> 11:04.797
"One incantation at the
stroke of midnight."

11:04.797 --> 11:06.232
What else?

11:06.232 --> 11:09.068
Peanut butter!

11:09.068 --> 11:10.936
Oh, "high mountaintop."

11:10.936 --> 11:13.139
Hmm, high mountaintop?

11:13.139 --> 11:16.942
Hey, the highest mountaintop
nearby is Green's Peak!

11:17.843 --> 11:19.078
You're right, Broo.

11:19.078 --> 11:20.813
It's time to go!

11:20.813 --> 11:25.484
This may be the room of plain
old Bert Raccoon tonight.

11:25.484 --> 11:29.355
But by morning, it'll belong
to the greatest wizard

11:29.355 --> 11:31.657
and magician since Merlin!

11:31.657 --> 11:35.561
Because tonight's the
night I, Bert raccoon,

11:36.729 --> 11:39.999
master of magic, waver of wands,

11:39.999 --> 11:43.369
the leader of the
pack, really make gold!

12:53.072 --> 12:56.876

13:00.579 --> 13:02.982
Let's set
this up and hide!

13:02.982 --> 13:04.784
When that lightning hits,

13:04.784 --> 13:08.220
it'll turn everything
around here to toast!

13:08.220 --> 13:11.056
And gold!

13:11.056 --> 13:15.194
And boy, oh boy will the
boss be impressed!

13:15.194 --> 13:17.429
Are you
sure the gold is safe?

13:17.429 --> 13:19.698
Of course it's safe!

13:19.698 --> 13:23.702
Only an idiot would be
out on a night like this!

13:25.738 --> 13:28.340
Fortunes hidden in the dark,

13:28.340 --> 13:30.442
behind the thunder's roll,

13:31.644 --> 13:35.648
at my command, you'll
spit and spark,

13:35.648 --> 13:37.049
surrendering your gold!

13:41.821 --> 13:44.590
Huh?

13:53.232 --> 13:54.066
Huh?

13:56.969 --> 13:59.572
I did it!

13:59.572 --> 14:00.372
I, Bert Raccoon, master
wizard, have created gold!

14:05.911 --> 14:08.814
Gold!

14:08.814 --> 14:09.648
Yahoo!

14:10.616 --> 14:13.052
Bert Raccoon's done it again!

14:15.788 --> 14:17.489
This is it, boys!

14:17.489 --> 14:21.961
That storm was strong enough
to fill Fort Knox with gold!

14:21.961 --> 14:23.395
Now, the boss'll really-

14:26.899 --> 14:29.535
Kill us!

14:29.535 --> 14:30.936
The gold!

14:30.936 --> 14:31.804
It's gone!

14:36.675 --> 14:39.245
The Raccoon
Gang toiled all night,

14:39.245 --> 14:42.147
looking for other ways
to save the newspaper.

14:42.147 --> 14:45.384
But their valiant effort
was just not enough.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.621
Can this really
be our last edition?

14:48.621 --> 14:53.359
Seems like only yesterday
that the first one came out.

14:53.359 --> 14:56.161
It's hard to
believe it's all over.

14:58.330 --> 14:59.531
Hang on, gang!

14:59.531 --> 15:03.535
I, Bert Raccoon,
grand master wizard,

15:03.535 --> 15:06.105
have saved the Standard!

15:08.173 --> 15:09.608
What are you
talking about, Bert?

15:09.608 --> 15:12.978
Nothing up my sleeve.

15:12.978 --> 15:15.447
Presto!

15:15.447 --> 15:18.217
The gold that will
save the Standard!

15:19.818 --> 15:21.253
Gold?

15:21.253 --> 15:23.522
Bert, where did you get this?

15:23.522 --> 15:24.623
I made it!

15:24.623 --> 15:26.492
Last night, during the storm!

15:26.492 --> 15:31.430
With my awesome magical
powers!

15:32.498 --> 15:34.600
Nobody can make gold!

15:34.600 --> 15:36.302
It's impossible!

15:36.302 --> 15:40.172
The impossible
is what I specialize in!

15:40.172 --> 15:42.041
And this is the gold
that's gonna buy

15:42.041 --> 15:44.109
all the supplies we need!

15:44.109 --> 15:45.477
It's worth money!

15:45.477 --> 15:47.246
Bert, we have the money.

15:47.246 --> 15:50.049
But the companies won't
sell us the supplies.

15:50.049 --> 15:50.883
Huh?

15:51.850 --> 15:53.218
You have the money?

15:53.218 --> 15:56.121
Bert, we really
appreciate what you've done,

15:56.121 --> 15:58.657
but you can't buy
what you can't get.

16:00.426 --> 16:01.260
The newspaper is
finished, isn't it?

16:07.099 --> 16:07.933
Hello?

16:07.933 --> 16:09.401
The Evergreen Standard.

16:09.401 --> 16:10.903
Well, hello!

16:10.903 --> 16:13.472
Cyril Sneer, here.

16:13.472 --> 16:17.576
I'm holding a press conference
at five to 12 today.

16:17.576 --> 16:19.244
It's a big story!

16:19.244 --> 16:21.747
One I'm sure you'll
be interested in.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.549
Well, thank you.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.885
That was Cyril Sneer.

16:26.885 --> 16:29.254
He's holding a very
important press conference

16:29.254 --> 16:30.422
just before noon.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.195
Are you ready
for the count, Cedric?

16:36.195 --> 16:37.463
Yes, Pop.

16:37.463 --> 16:39.398
All right,
let's get a move on!

16:39.398 --> 16:41.367
We've only got an hour!

16:41.367 --> 16:44.169
What kind of
count are we doing, Pop?

16:44.169 --> 16:46.438
A gold inventory.

16:46.438 --> 16:49.074
I wanna make sure it's all here.

16:49.074 --> 16:50.776
Let's go, Cedric!

16:50.776 --> 16:52.311
Time is money!

16:52.311 --> 16:53.779
My money!

16:53.779 --> 16:56.415
Right, Pop.

16:56.415 --> 16:58.450
Oh, what'll we do now?

16:59.918 --> 17:04.323
If he finds that the gold
is missing, we're done for!

17:04.323 --> 17:07.693
You try to stall him
while we search the forest!

17:07.693 --> 17:09.828
It's got to be out
there somewhere!

17:11.163 --> 17:13.098
Let's speed this up!

17:13.098 --> 17:15.834
You, start counting!

17:15.834 --> 17:16.668
Yes, sir!

17:20.572 --> 17:21.407
One,

17:21.407 --> 17:22.775
two,

17:22.775 --> 17:23.776
four,

17:23.776 --> 17:24.743
five,

17:24.743 --> 17:25.911
six-

17:25.911 --> 17:27.946
Uh, you missed "three."

17:27.946 --> 17:29.181
Oh, I did?

17:30.315 --> 17:32.317
I've always had
problems with geometry.

17:33.619 --> 17:36.455
Eight, nine...

17:36.455 --> 17:38.290
It's no good.

17:39.691 --> 17:41.927
We've looked everywhere!

17:41.927 --> 17:45.097
Our goose is cooked!

17:45.097 --> 17:48.133
Without the gold, the
boss won't be able to

17:48.133 --> 17:50.002
put the newspaper
out of business!

17:52.004 --> 17:53.405
Newspaper?

17:53.405 --> 17:56.241
Hey, there is
something we can do!

17:57.643 --> 17:59.278
What's that?

18:02.114 --> 18:02.948
But that's-

18:02.948 --> 18:04.683
That's the enemy!

18:04.683 --> 18:07.052
It's either that, or...

18:07.986 --> 18:09.621
Let's go!

18:22.201 --> 18:23.469
Quick, quick!

18:23.469 --> 18:25.871
Place this in your
newspaper for us!

18:25.871 --> 18:28.040
"Lost: one gold bar.

18:28.040 --> 18:28.941
handsome."

18:30.976 --> 18:32.644
Gold bar?

18:32.644 --> 18:33.545
Yes, yes!

18:34.546 --> 18:36.348
When
did you lose it?

18:36.348 --> 18:39.718
Last night, during the storm!

18:39.718 --> 18:43.388
We've got to get it back
as soon as possible!

18:43.388 --> 18:46.758
That's why the reward's so big!

18:46.758 --> 18:49.862
It's a matter of life and death!

18:49.862 --> 18:51.029
Ours!

18:52.965 --> 18:55.701
But I used
the magic formula!

18:55.701 --> 18:59.471
I waved my wand like
this, and poof, zap!

18:59.471 --> 19:03.242
I saw it happen right
before my eyes, honest!

19:03.242 --> 19:05.344
I made a small mistake
anyone could have made!

19:07.246 --> 19:09.081
Did they say "reward?"

19:11.850 --> 19:13.952
Uh, reward?

19:13.952 --> 19:16.421
What reward?

19:16.421 --> 19:18.657
You said that there
was a big reward!

19:18.657 --> 19:20.058
Ah!

19:20.058 --> 19:21.527
Oh, that reward!

19:21.527 --> 19:25.230
Well, we don't
really have a reward.

19:25.230 --> 19:28.100
No reward, no gold!

19:28.100 --> 19:29.468
Look, we'll do anything!

19:30.969 --> 19:31.770
Anything?

19:34.373 --> 19:35.707
Hurry, hurry, Cedric!

19:35.707 --> 19:37.776
We only have five minutes!

19:51.857 --> 19:53.792
Time is running out!

19:53.792 --> 19:55.294
What's our grand total?

19:55.294 --> 19:56.528
Gee, Pop.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.363
I don't know how
to tell you this,

19:58.363 --> 20:01.200
but we seem to be-

20:01.200 --> 20:02.501
Right on!

20:03.936 --> 20:05.237
This is it!

20:05.237 --> 20:06.538
In a few minutes,
it'll be all mine!

20:07.706 --> 20:08.874
Mine!

20:08.874 --> 20:10.442
Mine, all mine!

20:15.681 --> 20:17.583
I thought it would be
nice if you could be here

20:17.583 --> 20:19.885
to share history in the making.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.287
Do you see all this gold?

20:22.287 --> 20:25.123
It's hard to miss, Mr. Sneer.

20:25.123 --> 20:27.659
No, I'll miss it, all right.

20:27.659 --> 20:29.695
But it'll be for a good reason.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.697
Because there's enough
gold here to buy

20:31.697 --> 20:33.599
all the ink and paper factories

20:33.599 --> 20:35.500
this side of the
Evergreen Forest!

20:35.500 --> 20:39.037
So you're responsible for
our supplies being cut off!

20:39.037 --> 20:42.507
But Pop, that's hardly nice.

20:42.507 --> 20:43.976
Nice?

20:43.976 --> 20:47.079
This is the nicest thing
that's ever happened to me!

20:47.079 --> 20:48.347
I'm placing the call

20:48.347 --> 20:50.649
that's going to put an
end to your newspaper

20:50.649 --> 20:52.951
and your meddling for good!

20:52.951 --> 20:55.921
Pigs, call Mr. Knox!

20:57.689 --> 20:58.624
Hello?

21:00.459 --> 21:01.860
Uh, really?

21:04.196 --> 21:05.697
Are you sure?

21:08.667 --> 21:09.835
Okay, uh, bye!

21:12.271 --> 21:13.538
Who was that?

21:13.538 --> 21:17.342
Uh, well, it was,
uh, Mr. Knox's office.

21:17.342 --> 21:20.946
Well, it seems you're
a little too late.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.214
The deal is off.

21:22.214 --> 21:23.181
What?

21:23.181 --> 21:25.284
But I have the gold!

21:25.284 --> 21:28.787
Well, you missed
the deadline, sir.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.289
They won't sell.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.156
What?

21:31.156 --> 21:32.824
But it isn't noon yet!

21:32.824 --> 21:34.559
He has to sell!

21:34.559 --> 21:38.297
They just told me it's,
uh, three minutes past.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.931
Three minutes past?

21:39.931 --> 21:41.566
How's that possible?

21:41.566 --> 21:42.968
Who set the clock?

21:42.968 --> 21:44.002
Who?

21:44.002 --> 21:44.936
Speak up!

21:44.936 --> 21:47.372
I'll make an example of them!

21:47.372 --> 21:50.442
I think you forgot
something, Pop.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.146
Speak up!

21:54.146 --> 21:56.214
What secret policy?

21:56.214 --> 21:59.184
Maybe I shouldn't mention
it in front of the employees.

22:03.622 --> 22:04.456
Blast them!

22:04.456 --> 22:05.290
Tell me!

22:06.425 --> 22:09.594
Well, Pop, you rigged
the clocks years ago

22:09.594 --> 22:11.063
to be five minutes slow

22:11.063 --> 22:13.398
so you can get
more work out them

22:13.398 --> 22:15.567
and not have to pay them for it.

22:15.567 --> 22:20.172
You must have forgotten.

22:24.743 --> 22:26.244
By secretly
putting pressure

22:26.244 --> 22:28.780
on the Evergreen Standard
with his unsuccessful

22:28.780 --> 22:32.751
takeover scheme, Cyril Sneer
unwittingly made the newspaper

22:32.751 --> 22:36.021
a better and more
efficient enterprise.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.689
And the staff of the Standard

22:37.689 --> 22:39.524
even got some unexpected help.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.126
There you go!

22:41.126 --> 22:44.029
And, uh, while you're
delivering those papers, guys,

22:44.029 --> 22:47.733
don't forget to pick up the
old issues for recycling!

22:47.733 --> 22:50.001
You and your big ideas!

22:50.001 --> 22:50.936
Yeah!

22:50.936 --> 22:53.805
"We can make gold."

22:53.805 --> 22:56.141
"We'll put the newspaper
out of business

22:56.141 --> 22:58.110
and even get a raise!"

22:58.110 --> 22:59.811
Oh yes, I remember.

22:59.811 --> 23:01.480
"We'll do anything!"

23:02.681 --> 23:05.851
Shut up,
shut up, shut up!
