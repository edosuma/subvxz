WEBVTT

00:14.600 --> 00:16.342
Fire crews
and emergency personnel

00:16.442 --> 00:18.824
have responded in
the predawn hours this morning

00:18.924 --> 00:20.506
to a devastating fire

00:20.606 --> 00:23.629
at the venerable
Perez Sugar Factory.

00:23.729 --> 00:25.391
Authorities are on site,

00:25.491 --> 00:28.373
but the cause of the fire
has not been disclosed.

00:35.901 --> 00:38.923
Generations of Prescotts
walked through those halls.

00:39.023 --> 00:40.405
Yes, I know the fight song,
Mother.

00:40.505 --> 00:42.567
I was your father's secretary
when we were married.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.569
-Still going.
-We were so proud to...

00:44.669 --> 00:46.971
Know the name
of every man and woman

00:47.071 --> 00:48.573
that worked there.

00:48.673 --> 00:50.975
You should not make fun,
Bellwether.

00:51.075 --> 00:53.898
You loved inspecting the fields
with your father.

00:53.998 --> 00:55.659
He carried you on his shoulders

00:55.759 --> 00:59.343
so you could see
over the cane and...

00:59.443 --> 01:01.705
Indigo...

01:01.805 --> 01:03.467
thought you were the future.

01:03.567 --> 01:06.270
Note the past tense.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.151
There.

01:08.251 --> 01:10.193
The flames burned hotter
on the top floor,

01:10.293 --> 01:12.756
which means that was
the point of ignition.

01:12.856 --> 01:14.998
The top floor
w-was all offices.

01:15.098 --> 01:17.160
It was desks and file storage

01:17.260 --> 01:20.163
and the Girls of Miami-Dade
calendar

01:20.263 --> 01:21.524
that no one bothered
to take down.

01:21.624 --> 01:23.286
File storage? What files?

01:23.386 --> 01:26.529
Everything--schedules,
shipping and receiving,

01:26.629 --> 01:28.211
uh, personnel.

01:28.311 --> 01:30.573
Let's play "Wheel of Arson"
for a minute, Mother.

01:30.673 --> 01:32.775
Say you wanted to
destroy a building.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.498
-You mean for the insurance?
-Yes.

01:35.598 --> 01:37.379
You set a fire
at the ground level

01:37.479 --> 01:39.021
so that it burns up and out.

01:39.121 --> 01:42.704
But whoever did this,
they didn't want to destroy.

01:42.804 --> 01:44.987
They wanted to target.

01:45.087 --> 01:46.428
Why?

01:46.528 --> 01:48.470
To hide all the names
of the men and women

01:48.570 --> 01:50.912
you were so proud to know...

01:51.012 --> 01:52.554
to block us from tracing

01:52.654 --> 01:55.276
how many of them got sick
from the same thing

01:55.376 --> 01:57.899
that ate up Jeremiah Cedar.

02:07.748 --> 02:09.650
How about a comment
for "The Post"?

02:09.750 --> 02:12.653
I don't have a comment,
but I do have a question.

02:12.753 --> 02:14.855
Do you still have
the key to my house?

02:14.955 --> 02:17.378
No.

02:17.478 --> 02:19.259
I don't know. Maybe.

02:19.359 --> 02:21.221
Do you think that
maybe you stopped by

02:21.321 --> 02:23.143
at some point
in the last 24 hours?

02:23.243 --> 02:25.866
And don't lie,
because I got a Ring.

02:25.966 --> 02:27.347
No, you don't.

02:27.447 --> 02:29.950
And why would I come by
when you're not there?

02:30.050 --> 02:32.792
Why are you looking
at me like that?

02:32.892 --> 02:34.114
'Cause I'm trying to decide

02:34.214 --> 02:37.717
if you graduated
from deadbeat dad to criminal.

02:37.817 --> 02:39.679
That's why.

02:39.779 --> 02:41.921
Have a good day.

02:42.021 --> 02:43.923
Sheriff.

02:44.023 --> 02:46.025
Got a minute?

02:47.666 --> 02:51.210
I understand you were let go,
Lorde, which is a damn shame,

02:51.310 --> 02:53.012
but there's nothing
I can do about it.

02:53.112 --> 02:54.533
Look, we investigated
the Perez family,

02:54.633 --> 02:55.614
and there's a fire.

02:55.714 --> 02:57.456
This--this isn't an accident.

02:57.556 --> 03:01.500
I can't even think straight
'cause of this goddamn drone.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.142
I didn't process anything
you just said.

03:04.242 --> 03:05.584
We pushed them,

03:05.684 --> 03:08.466
and they burned down a piece
of your county, Sheriff.

03:08.566 --> 03:09.828
They're dangerous.

03:09.928 --> 03:12.390
Look, I know this was arson.

03:12.490 --> 03:14.032
You know it was arson.

03:14.132 --> 03:15.593
But what we don't need

03:15.693 --> 03:20.198
is to put the Perezes on alert
before I have evidence.

03:20.298 --> 03:22.159
Holy shit.

03:22.259 --> 03:24.582
I can't take this anymore.

03:32.950 --> 03:36.994
Now, you pass that message
along to Bell Prescott, too.

03:40.077 --> 03:42.078
Okay.

03:42.479 --> 03:43.980
Look, I'm--I'm sorry

03:44.080 --> 03:46.863
your creepy Peeping Tom toy
got killed,

03:46.963 --> 03:49.025
but whatever the Perezes
are hiding,

03:49.125 --> 03:51.988
there's nothing I can do
because the mayor fired me.

03:52.088 --> 03:53.389
He fired you?

03:53.489 --> 03:55.511
He fired me.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.513
The mayor
is an exasperating fribble.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.956
Assuming that's an insult,

04:00.056 --> 04:02.598
the mayor didn't fire me
because he's an idiot...

04:02.698 --> 04:03.959
which he is.

04:04.059 --> 04:06.482
He fired me
because I didn't do my job.

04:06.582 --> 04:08.043
Because of me?

04:08.143 --> 04:11.046
Yes, because of you.

04:11.146 --> 04:12.968
Look, I-I like you, Bell.

04:13.068 --> 04:15.370
I... I have no idea why,

04:15.470 --> 04:19.694
but maybe it's time
for both of us just to move on.

04:19.794 --> 04:21.977
They burned their own factory!

04:22.077 --> 04:24.179
It's a cover-up.
It's practically Nixonian.

04:24.279 --> 04:25.660
This cannot be tolerated.

04:25.760 --> 04:26.941
Okay.

04:27.041 --> 04:29.584
You need to go take
all the pills,

04:29.684 --> 04:32.667
and I got to go return my car,
which I'm weirdly gonna miss.

04:32.767 --> 04:34.068
We cannot leave this

04:34.168 --> 04:35.670
up to Sheriff Moonshine
and his Hardy Boys.

04:35.770 --> 04:38.713
I am not a cop anymore, okay?

04:38.813 --> 04:41.675
And I have to go get a job,
or I can't pay rent.

04:41.775 --> 04:43.357
You do have
an excellent physique.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.999
You could call Darby
and see if there

04:45.099 --> 04:47.481
are any openings at the--

04:47.581 --> 04:50.204
Say the words "strip club,"

04:50.304 --> 04:52.306
and I'm gonna
kick you in the testicles.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.630
Gentlemen's club?

05:01.474 --> 05:03.016
Has it occurred to you

05:03.116 --> 05:05.819
that if we solve the biggest
unsolved crime in this county,

05:05.919 --> 05:08.381
the mayor will have no choice
but to reinstate you?

05:08.481 --> 05:10.383
Maybe I don't want
to get reinstated.

05:10.483 --> 05:12.865
I didn't like
that damn job anyway.

05:12.965 --> 05:14.967
You were good at that job
you didn't like.

05:16.449 --> 05:19.351
I see the seeds of greatness
in you, Cammie Lorde.

05:19.451 --> 05:21.353
Oh, you're laying it on
way too thick.

05:21.453 --> 05:24.236
I'm not laying it on.

05:24.336 --> 05:28.360
I mean it...

05:28.460 --> 05:30.462
With great sincerity.

05:33.105 --> 05:35.367
-We need to go to Tampa.
-Tampa?

05:35.467 --> 05:37.689
-Tampa, Florida?
-No. No, no, no.

05:37.789 --> 05:39.891
You know that's someplace
other than here, right?

05:39.991 --> 05:42.414
The fire burned the hard
copies of the employee files,

05:42.514 --> 05:44.736
but the digital files
of those same copies would be--

05:44.836 --> 05:47.618
-At El Calvero in Tampa.
-Exactly.

05:47.718 --> 05:50.782
See? You are good at your job.

05:50.882 --> 05:53.104
Now, with a little training
you would definitely be better.

05:53.204 --> 05:54.865
Okay, w-we're just two people.

05:54.965 --> 05:56.907
What are we supposed to do
with just two people?

05:57.007 --> 05:59.009
She's right.
You're both losers.

06:01.211 --> 06:03.674
You're right.

06:03.774 --> 06:04.835
What am I?

06:04.935 --> 06:06.476
I'm just an agoraphobe

06:06.576 --> 06:08.959
with substance-abuse issues
and depressive episodes,

06:09.059 --> 06:10.721
and what are you, even?

06:10.821 --> 06:13.323
You're just an ex-traffic cop
in a one-stoplight town.

06:13.423 --> 06:15.285
Yeah.

06:15.385 --> 06:17.707
We were never gonna solve
this thing.

06:22.031 --> 06:24.033
You know what?

06:25.475 --> 06:27.476
Fuck that.

06:28.237 --> 06:31.340
Fuck that tiny box that keeps
getting smaller and smaller

06:31.440 --> 06:33.262
until you can't breathe.

06:33.362 --> 06:35.704
Fuck that traffic light
and the radar gun

06:35.804 --> 06:38.067
and your--your depression
and all the alcohol

06:38.167 --> 06:39.908
and those weird suits
you insist on wearing,

06:40.008 --> 06:41.430
even though they make
you look like Mark Twain.

06:41.530 --> 06:43.312
Well, thank you.
He is my fashion icon.

06:43.412 --> 06:45.033
Do you really think
he'd reinstate me?

06:45.133 --> 06:47.616
Oh, he'd have no choice but to.

06:51.539 --> 06:54.142
Did I-- did I just get played?

06:56.104 --> 06:57.926
Yeah.

06:58.026 --> 07:00.048
Wow.

07:00.148 --> 07:01.649
You're good.

07:01.749 --> 07:03.751
See you in two hours.

07:10.758 --> 07:12.179
157

07:12.279 --> 07:14.702
Marcus will pick you up
at the Prescotts', okay?

07:14.802 --> 07:16.463
Just gone for--for one night.

07:16.563 --> 07:18.065
Where are you going?

07:18.165 --> 07:21.228
Out of town with Mr. Prescott.

07:21.328 --> 07:23.430
Not, like, out of town.

07:23.530 --> 07:26.153
You know, it's, um...
it's a work trip.

07:26.253 --> 07:28.415
-We have work to do.
-Are you gonna have sex?

07:30.457 --> 07:32.839
What?

07:32.939 --> 07:35.281
D-do you even know
what that word means?

07:35.381 --> 07:37.003
Miss Millicent told me.

07:37.103 --> 07:39.646
It's how you get blue tomatoes.

07:39.746 --> 07:44.330
Oh, baby, no, no, no, no,
no sex.

07:44.430 --> 07:48.174
No tomatoes, okay?
It's just business.

07:48.274 --> 07:50.836
Do people have sex
the same way as tomatoes?

07:53.679 --> 07:54.620
Yes.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.261
Yes, they do.

07:56.361 --> 07:59.304
Exactly like that.

07:59.404 --> 08:01.406
God, I'm a terrible mother.

08:03.849 --> 08:05.510
A road trip?

08:05.610 --> 08:07.232
You can't even take a shit
without me by your side,

08:07.332 --> 08:09.474
and you're gonna drive on I-75?

08:09.574 --> 08:13.118
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

08:13.218 --> 08:15.119
Oh, bay rum.

08:15.219 --> 08:17.402
Are you delusional?

08:17.502 --> 08:19.884
You think she's gonna sleep
with you.

08:19.984 --> 08:21.205
If anything,
it'll be a pity fuck.

08:21.305 --> 08:25.149
Go away!

08:27.231 --> 08:29.974
-That was not directed at you.
-I figured.

08:30.074 --> 08:32.576
It's cool, man.

08:32.676 --> 08:36.380
But you're never gonna
fit all that into the Porsche.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.702
I was hoping
I could borrow a vehicle.

08:38.802 --> 08:40.864
We've got
a family beater, but...

08:40.964 --> 08:42.706
I mean, I'd have to make up,
like, a bunch of lies.

08:42.806 --> 08:44.808
Prevaricate as needed.

08:49.933 --> 08:51.434
Dude, seriously?

08:51.534 --> 08:53.116
I need it.

08:53.216 --> 08:54.597
What if the hotel lighting

08:54.697 --> 08:57.860
doesn't have
a suitable lumen level?

08:59.662 --> 09:02.925
I will remove the lamp...

09:03.025 --> 09:05.027
but I will keep the bulb.

09:08.350 --> 09:10.052
I...

09:10.152 --> 09:13.095
do not want to know
where you got this.

09:13.195 --> 09:15.197
Nope.

09:17.399 --> 09:20.582
And, um...

09:20.682 --> 09:22.744
tell me why we need this.

09:22.844 --> 09:25.146
It's like
a emotional-support animal.

09:25.246 --> 09:28.269
You know, about a month ago,

09:28.369 --> 09:30.191
I would have thought
that this was just crazy,

09:30.291 --> 09:32.714
but, um, now it's just Monday.

09:32.814 --> 09:36.117
Does this rolling coffin
have a, uh...

09:36.217 --> 09:38.119
set of keys?

09:38.219 --> 09:40.221
Oh.

09:42.943 --> 09:44.645
I wouldn't take it over 40.

09:44.745 --> 09:46.947
And if it starts to make
a noise like this...

09:49.149 --> 09:52.052
Then I would immediately pull
over to the side of the road,

09:52.152 --> 09:55.896
run at least 20 feet
from the vehicle.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.458
Once the largest employer
in the county,

09:58.558 --> 10:00.820
the site
of the Perez Sugar Factory

10:00.920 --> 10:02.662
is now in near-ruin,

10:02.762 --> 10:04.904
as the damage is assessed
by authorities

10:05.004 --> 10:07.307
and the source of the fire
is investigated.

10:07.407 --> 10:10.630
Fire wasn't my first choice,
but it was a necessary one.

10:10.730 --> 10:12.512
Yes, please tell me

10:12.612 --> 10:14.554
about all the necessary choices
you've made.

10:14.654 --> 10:16.515
None of the manufacturing
equipment was damaged,

10:16.615 --> 10:19.438
and our insurance will pay for
the rest, so relax, mi vida.

10:19.538 --> 10:22.481
I promise,
I covered all our bases.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.643
What?
You're not gonna say anything?

10:24.743 --> 10:29.047
Ay, Alejandro,
you stupid, stupid man.

10:29.147 --> 10:32.791
Next time you have
a bright idea, don't do it.

10:35.153 --> 10:38.296
After work,
can you check on Mother?

10:38.396 --> 10:41.259
Why? Dude,
it's gonna be, like, one night.

10:41.359 --> 10:43.341
She hasn't been alone in years.

10:43.441 --> 10:45.503
What will she do with herself?

10:45.603 --> 10:47.545
Whatever old ladies do,
you know--

10:47.645 --> 10:50.808
knit, vote Republican,
or kill their husbands.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.312
He's already dead.

10:54.412 --> 10:56.413
So not that.

10:57.815 --> 10:59.677
Ugh!

10:59.777 --> 11:01.558
Your mother insisted.

11:01.658 --> 11:03.440
She does know
that we're just going to Tampa

11:03.540 --> 11:05.362
for one night, right?

11:05.462 --> 11:08.565
Overpacking's
kind of a family theme.

11:08.665 --> 11:10.987
You can't do this without me.

11:16.513 --> 11:18.515
I can do this.

11:22.278 --> 11:24.580
-How you doing, camper?
-I'm doing fine.

11:24.680 --> 11:26.142
I'm doing fine.

11:26.242 --> 11:27.703
You need to distract yourself.

11:27.803 --> 11:29.105
I am distracting myself.

11:29.205 --> 11:31.867
I am debating
whether it would be worse

11:31.967 --> 11:33.709
to be a trench soldier
in World War I

11:33.809 --> 11:36.352
or a foot soldier
during the Civil War.

11:36.452 --> 11:38.794
Scholars argue
which was bloodier--

11:38.894 --> 11:42.077
the Battle of the Somme
or the Battle of Antietam.

11:42.177 --> 11:43.639
W-we're discussing this?

11:43.739 --> 11:45.841
In fact, the bloodiest
was the Battle of Cannae,

11:45.941 --> 11:47.362
during the Second Punic War,

11:47.462 --> 11:51.766
which had
a 53.42% fatality rate.

11:51.866 --> 11:55.890
Okay, so you're not a fan
of road trips.

11:55.990 --> 11:59.053
Actually...

11:59.153 --> 12:03.057
Vida and I used to drive down
to the Keys every summer.

12:03.157 --> 12:04.699
Yeah?

12:04.799 --> 12:09.103
There's a little place
on the south end of Islamorada.

12:09.203 --> 12:11.946
Is it worth a visit?

12:12.046 --> 12:14.168
It used to be.

12:16.730 --> 12:19.953
Now I can't even get
past the county line.

12:20.053 --> 12:22.316
Oh, actually,
we passed the county line

12:22.416 --> 12:24.418
about a few miles back.

12:26.419 --> 12:28.421
Mm-hmm.

12:30.664 --> 12:32.906
I have developed
a sudden thirst.

12:43.155 --> 12:46.719
-Your mother packed a gun?
-For the road.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.423
That thing looks older
than the state of Florida.

12:50.523 --> 12:53.025
Well, Florida became
a state in 1845,

12:53.125 --> 12:55.347
and this became a gun in 1929,

12:55.447 --> 12:57.189
so you are incorrect.

12:57.289 --> 12:58.871
Wow.

12:58.971 --> 13:03.315
Fuck, you're like hanging
out with "Jeopardy!".

13:03.415 --> 13:04.956
There's a note.

13:05.056 --> 13:07.559
"I pressed the bullets myself
so they are untraceable.

13:07.659 --> 13:09.040
Love, Mom."

13:09.140 --> 13:12.043
Wow.
That's both so sweet and...

13:12.143 --> 13:14.265
so messed up.

13:16.908 --> 13:18.649
Oh, afternoon, Miss Millicent.

13:18.749 --> 13:21.572
Uh, Bell asked me to stop by
and just--

13:21.672 --> 13:23.414
Is that a new hat?

13:23.514 --> 13:25.656
It's just new to this decade.

13:25.756 --> 13:28.179
I haven't worn this old girl
in years.

13:28.279 --> 13:29.860
What's the occasion?

13:29.960 --> 13:32.623
I'm going out.

13:32.723 --> 13:34.945
Did you know that I haven't

13:35.045 --> 13:38.589
left this property
in five years?

13:38.689 --> 13:41.631
-Where are you going?
-It's where we're going.

13:41.731 --> 13:42.833
Oh, all right.

13:42.933 --> 13:44.714
We're gonna have so much fun.

13:44.814 --> 13:48.118
Oh, I'd like to do my feet,
if there's time.

13:48.218 --> 13:51.080
Don't you just love
a good callous scrub?

13:51.180 --> 13:53.002
Yeah.
I actually have some plans--

13:53.102 --> 13:56.786
You wouldn't leave me
stranded, would you?

14:06.595 --> 14:08.938
This isn't the way
I told you to go.

14:09.038 --> 14:12.541
I gave you specific directions.

14:12.641 --> 14:14.983
Really? I'm supposed
to take directions

14:15.083 --> 14:18.066
from a man who hasn't
left his house in five years?

14:18.166 --> 14:20.809
You ignored me,
and now we are going to die!

14:23.732 --> 14:26.955
Hello, where are you go--

14:27.055 --> 14:29.057
Really?

14:29.537 --> 14:31.359
Hey, get back in the--

14:31.459 --> 14:33.821
Oh, my God, It's like
I'm in freakin' "Rain Man."

14:36.984 --> 14:38.486
What?

14:38.586 --> 14:42.670
Hey, hey, lady, you looking
for the toll fee in there?

14:45.592 --> 14:47.414
Okay, we're moving now.

14:47.514 --> 14:49.817
Can you get back in the car?
Okay.

14:49.917 --> 14:51.658
Oh, God!

14:53.760 --> 14:57.664
311

14:57.764 --> 15:00.427
Coccoloba uvifera.

15:00.527 --> 15:02.268
Sabal palmetto.

15:02.368 --> 15:03.870
Taxodium distichum.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.272
What is it this time?

15:06.372 --> 15:08.194
Species of trees...

15:08.294 --> 15:10.316
native
to the Florida Panhandle.

15:10.416 --> 15:12.839
Right. Why don't you know
normal stuff?

15:12.939 --> 15:14.841
Like what?

15:14.941 --> 15:17.803
I don't know, like the cast
of "Fast & Furious."

15:17.903 --> 15:21.207
Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson,

15:21.307 --> 15:24.730
Jordana Brewster,
Tyrese Gibson,

15:24.830 --> 15:28.273
oh, Paul Walker--
rest in peace.

15:31.757 --> 15:34.379
Okay, fine. I'm gonna go inside
and get us some cold drinks

15:34.479 --> 15:35.420
and cheesesteaks.

15:35.520 --> 15:36.822
Magnolia grandiflora.

15:36.922 --> 15:38.923
To go.

15:42.887 --> 15:44.108
Hi, Mommy!

15:44.208 --> 15:45.149
Hey, baby.

15:45.249 --> 15:46.831
Is something wrong?

15:46.931 --> 15:49.193
No, I'm just calling to make
sure that everything's okay.

15:49.293 --> 15:51.516
It's great. Dad's awesome.

15:51.616 --> 15:53.357
You're having fun, huh?

15:53.457 --> 15:54.839
Do you want to talk to him?

15:54.939 --> 15:56.721
No, no, no, no, no.
That's--that's okay.

15:56.821 --> 15:59.763
I'll just, um...
talk to you later, all right?

15:59.863 --> 16:01.245
We're gonna play some more.

16:01.345 --> 16:02.486
I gotta go.

16:02.586 --> 16:03.887
-Okay, I love you, bug.
-Love you.

16:03.987 --> 16:05.989
Okay, bye.

16:32.615 --> 16:34.757
Shit!

16:34.857 --> 16:37.760
Here you go--your food.

16:37.860 --> 16:40.202
Are you okay, sweetie?

16:40.302 --> 16:42.244
Are you okay?

16:42.344 --> 16:44.246
You look like you saw a ghost.

16:44.346 --> 16:46.948
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.703
You look strange.

17:01.803 --> 17:04.826
Says the man holding hands
with a life-size hump doll.

17:04.926 --> 17:07.268
Hey, I'm not pretending

17:07.368 --> 17:09.350
to be anything but strange.

17:09.450 --> 17:12.032
Cammie.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.755
-Cammie what happened in there?
-Nothing.

17:14.855 --> 17:16.437
Nothing happened.

17:16.537 --> 17:18.539
Just--just drop it, all right?

17:30.190 --> 17:33.253
I'm not gonna lie.
This place kind of rocks.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.255
I haven't been here

17:35.355 --> 17:38.378
in such a long time.

17:38.478 --> 17:40.340
Why so long?

17:40.440 --> 17:42.822
Well, I-I was taking care
of everyone--

17:42.922 --> 17:45.484
my--my husband, my son...

17:46.886 --> 17:48.387
My alligator.

17:48.487 --> 17:51.550
You didn't make the list?

17:51.650 --> 17:55.214
Well, you can dream
for yourself, but...

17:56.935 --> 17:58.277
Life is...

17:58.377 --> 18:00.419
Other people.

18:06.024 --> 18:07.726
Maybe it's the bubbles
getting to me,

18:07.826 --> 18:10.228
but that sounds
like a shitty deal.

18:27.444 --> 18:29.547
Are we gonna talk about it?

18:29.647 --> 18:31.789
Talk about what?

18:31.889 --> 18:34.271
What happened
at that roadside diner.

18:34.371 --> 18:36.553
No.

18:36.653 --> 18:38.875
No, we're not gonna
talk about it.

18:38.975 --> 18:41.438
You're sad.

18:41.538 --> 18:45.562
For some unaccountable reason,
that's making me sad.

18:45.662 --> 18:47.764
Wanna cry?
I would cry with you.

18:47.864 --> 18:49.866
No, no, I don't.

18:51.828 --> 18:53.529
I don't want to cry, okay?

18:53.629 --> 18:55.972
What I want to do is just go
inside and get us checked in.

18:56.072 --> 18:57.493
You stay here
and try not to act

18:57.593 --> 18:59.775
like this is your first day
on the planet.

18:59.875 --> 19:01.217
You're--you're leaving me?

19:01.317 --> 19:03.659
We both know I can't handle
that responsibility!

19:03.759 --> 19:05.181
It's the car

19:05.281 --> 19:07.062
or a crowded lobby
with half an acre of mirrors.

19:07.162 --> 19:09.164
You pick.

19:14.129 --> 19:16.131
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Stay inside.

19:30.625 --> 19:32.627
No! No, no.

19:34.749 --> 19:36.751
Please tell me
this isn't happening.

20:07.420 --> 20:09.922
What are you doing in Tampa?

20:10.022 --> 20:11.484
These things don't just come

20:11.584 --> 20:13.646
out of a magic gumball machine,
you know.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.968
I can't get
into that right now.

20:16.068 --> 20:17.650
I just need a refill...

20:17.750 --> 20:19.331
immediately.

20:19.431 --> 20:22.414
Scale of one to ten,
where's your anxiety currently?

20:22.514 --> 20:25.257
Orbiting Pluto.

20:25.357 --> 20:27.579
Ah, fine.

20:27.679 --> 20:30.582
I will just live here

20:30.682 --> 20:33.044
under this bus bench.

20:41.412 --> 20:44.475
Whoa. What happened in here?

20:44.575 --> 20:47.198
It's like your brain
exploded all over the room.

20:47.298 --> 20:48.639
Oh, no, if it did,

20:48.739 --> 20:50.922
there would be grey matter
everywhere, blood,

20:51.022 --> 20:53.324
some skull,
minimally from the pterion.

20:53.424 --> 20:55.246
The pterion
is incredibly fragile.

20:55.346 --> 20:57.568
Now, that's why Maori warriors

20:57.668 --> 21:01.772
created a weapon specifically
designed to fracture it.

21:01.872 --> 21:04.214
You brought a light bulb?

21:04.314 --> 21:06.296
Judge not lest ye be judged,

21:06.396 --> 21:09.179
for with what judgment you
judge, you shall be judged.

21:09.279 --> 21:12.582
I am perfectly happy judging
this whole thing right now.

21:12.682 --> 21:16.746
Oh, by the way, um,
front desk delivered this.

21:16.846 --> 21:19.229
Return address
is Brumunddal, Norway.

21:19.329 --> 21:21.331
Excellent.

21:22.892 --> 21:26.676
You know you can take those
with water, right?

21:26.776 --> 21:28.397
That's what normal humans do.

21:28.497 --> 21:30.159
The bitterness is bracing.

21:30.259 --> 21:31.721
Well, now that you mention it,

21:31.821 --> 21:33.362
I do have that nice bottle
of rosé.

21:33.462 --> 21:36.846
-Uh-uh, it's almost 6:00.
-What's at 6:00?

21:36.946 --> 21:38.687
I booked us a tour
of El Calvero.

21:38.787 --> 21:40.369
We need to scope out the place.

21:40.469 --> 21:42.251
Also, I don't know
if there's a way

21:42.351 --> 21:44.012
for you to be low profile.

21:44.112 --> 21:47.496
Seems unlikely, but, um...

21:47.596 --> 21:49.718
I considered that.

21:50.759 --> 21:52.981
Should I brace myself?

21:53.081 --> 21:56.845
Do you want to be Orlando
or Panama City Beach?

21:59.247 --> 22:02.050
I should have
gone with Orlando.

22:03.891 --> 22:06.994
Can you--can you slow down
on those, please?

22:07.094 --> 22:09.357
You must have half of
Walgreen's in your bloodstream.

22:09.457 --> 22:11.278
-I feel just peaches.
-Oh, yeah.

22:11.378 --> 22:12.880
This room houses

22:12.980 --> 22:15.362
our 15-year-old
premium label special reserve--

22:15.462 --> 22:17.645
our most prestigious rum.

22:17.745 --> 22:20.207
And here, you'll find one
of our tasting stations,

22:20.307 --> 22:22.529
where you can sample
for yourself.

22:22.629 --> 22:24.871
Ahh. That's not half bad.

22:26.753 --> 22:29.176
I mean, 15-year-old booze--
it should be good.

22:29.276 --> 22:32.178
Oh, how'd you know
that's what it was?

22:32.278 --> 22:35.181
An enchanted
willow tree told me.

22:35.281 --> 22:37.383
The tour guide
literally just said it.

22:37.483 --> 22:39.185
Can you just--
can you focus, please?

22:39.285 --> 22:41.187
I am coping.

22:41.287 --> 22:42.829
What are you doing,
besides lying

22:42.929 --> 22:45.071
about what happened
back at that roadside diner.

22:45.171 --> 22:46.632
We are past that.

22:46.732 --> 22:49.515
Mm, no, it's still there.

22:49.615 --> 22:50.836
God.

22:50.936 --> 22:52.558
Yeah, I noted
the fresh abrasion

22:52.658 --> 22:54.400
on the side of your hand,

22:54.500 --> 22:56.562
because I was watching you
the entire time,

22:56.662 --> 22:58.403
absent a 40-second window

22:58.503 --> 23:01.546
when you disappeared toward
the rear of the establishment.

23:02.868 --> 23:04.569
Clearly, that abrasion occurred

23:04.669 --> 23:06.011
during that interregnum.

23:06.111 --> 23:08.053
There were three things
of note.

23:08.153 --> 23:10.535
One, a drug deal to the east
of the building,

23:10.635 --> 23:12.417
but you were not in proximity.

23:12.517 --> 23:15.180
Two, a tangle
between two stray dogs

23:15.280 --> 23:17.342
over a strawberry milkshake.

23:17.442 --> 23:19.384
Ah, not that.

23:19.484 --> 23:22.667
And third,
a couple in a camper van

23:22.767 --> 23:25.549
emerged from the rear
of the parking area.

23:25.649 --> 23:28.472
A rear parking lot
with a palm tree,

23:28.572 --> 23:31.835
whose thorny flesh would
account for that abrasion.

23:31.935 --> 23:35.119
So perhaps
a troubling encounter

23:35.219 --> 23:39.363
led you to vent on a poor
little innocent palm tree.

23:39.463 --> 23:41.465
Ah, ah, ah.

23:47.871 --> 23:50.153
The assassins themselves.

23:56.599 --> 23:58.421
Well, it looks like
we just need a key card

23:58.521 --> 24:00.603
to get into the offices.

24:02.805 --> 24:04.627
We could follow
a security guard home,

24:04.727 --> 24:07.109
break into his house,
steal his card,

24:07.209 --> 24:09.752
print out a copy
with an RFID scanner,

24:09.852 --> 24:12.674
then break back in,
and replace his card.

24:12.774 --> 24:14.837
Oh. Oh, that's all
we have to do?

24:14.937 --> 24:16.438
We should just do that.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.160
I sense you're being sarcastic.

24:18.260 --> 24:20.262
I am?

24:22.264 --> 24:27.088
Or we could just have drinks
with Ramon and take his card.

24:27.188 --> 24:29.931
Ramon Perez?
Like Vida's brother?

24:30.031 --> 24:32.173
So you can just call him?

24:32.273 --> 24:33.855
Why not?

24:33.955 --> 24:35.977
Once upon a time, we were, uh--

24:36.077 --> 24:38.619
what's the word?

24:38.719 --> 24:40.721
Chums.

24:42.443 --> 24:44.465
And if you'll follow me
into the next room,

24:44.565 --> 24:46.186
we'll learn some history.

24:48.449 --> 24:50.450
491

24:57.097 --> 24:59.119
Think of Vida's family

24:59.219 --> 25:01.962
like a school
of hungry piranha,

25:02.062 --> 25:04.484
except Ramon is like
the vegetarian in the pack.

25:04.584 --> 25:06.166
When he came out of the closet,

25:06.266 --> 25:07.967
his parents
weren't mad that he was gay.

25:08.067 --> 25:09.769
They were mad that
he was dating a Democrat.

25:09.869 --> 25:11.451
Okay, we get his wallet,
we get the key card,

25:11.551 --> 25:13.553
we get the hell out of here.

25:16.075 --> 25:18.938
I feel bad taking
advantage of him.

25:19.038 --> 25:22.341
If Grant's right,
this guy is a dealer, Bell.

25:22.441 --> 25:26.665
Bellwether Prescott,
my old chum!

25:26.765 --> 25:29.228
You look good, papi.

25:29.328 --> 25:31.350
What is that--
uh, Barry's or CrossFit

25:31.450 --> 25:33.271
or just drinking
and not leaving the house?

25:33.371 --> 25:35.514
Ding, ding, ding.
It is door number three.

25:35.614 --> 25:38.116
I love it. I love this guy.
This guy's a crack-up.

25:38.216 --> 25:41.039
-Isn't he a crack-up?
-Yeah, fully cracked up.

25:41.139 --> 25:42.680
It's true.

25:42.780 --> 25:44.923
And a señorita by your side.

25:45.023 --> 25:46.164
Dios mío.

25:46.264 --> 25:48.526
The night gets interesting.

25:48.626 --> 25:50.988
Are you two "fucking"?

25:52.710 --> 25:54.932
Why the air quotes?

25:55.032 --> 25:56.854
How much cocaine are you on?

25:56.954 --> 25:59.737
I'm not gonna lie...

25:59.837 --> 26:01.839
a fair amount.

26:03.761 --> 26:06.063
Did you get that here, or did
you, uh, bring it yourself?

26:06.163 --> 26:07.544
Papi, ven acá.

26:07.644 --> 26:10.867
Ooh, I am feeling young.

26:10.967 --> 26:13.550
You want a Jell-O shot?
Jell-O shot? Jell-O shot?

26:13.650 --> 26:15.712
-Uh, no, thank you.
-Uh, I'm good.

26:15.812 --> 26:17.814
12 Jell-O shots,
every colour of the rainbow.

26:21.457 --> 26:23.600
Thanks, baby.

26:23.700 --> 26:25.962
Hey, it's getting hot in here.

26:26.062 --> 26:28.044
You want me to take your jacket
and put it over here by mine?

26:28.144 --> 26:30.806
No, baby, I am good.

26:30.906 --> 26:33.028
Now, a pachanguear. Come on.

26:42.437 --> 26:44.379
She's a business partner.

26:44.479 --> 26:47.623
It's a new alcohol venture.

26:47.723 --> 26:49.624
I love it.

26:49.724 --> 26:52.908
Women should run everything,
don't you think?

26:53.008 --> 26:54.589
I like him.

26:54.689 --> 26:57.632
So what's the alcohol?

26:57.732 --> 26:59.594
Your venture?

26:59.694 --> 27:01.876
Oh, coconut Cognac.

27:01.976 --> 27:04.318
I figured we'd steer clear
of rum--

27:04.418 --> 27:07.001
you know, respect your lane.

27:07.101 --> 27:09.003
Coconut Cognac.

27:09.103 --> 27:10.604
Who would have thought it?

27:10.704 --> 27:13.928
I literally love that.

27:14.028 --> 27:16.690
-I love her. She's a keeper.
-Oh, it's not a romance.

27:16.790 --> 27:19.253
Right.

27:19.353 --> 27:20.854
I think
it's a great idea, papi--

27:20.954 --> 27:22.216
you know, something for you

27:22.316 --> 27:24.338
to really pour
your energy into, you know?

27:24.438 --> 27:25.979
Told you.

27:26.079 --> 27:28.081
Oh, God, I love Jell-O shots.

27:34.047 --> 27:35.829
Ramon and Vida and I--

27:35.929 --> 27:38.471
we used to get into
all sorts of hijinks.

27:38.571 --> 27:40.113
Hijinks?

27:40.213 --> 27:43.716
Yeah. Yeah, that's a word
that grown-ass people use.

27:43.816 --> 27:45.718
But he is not people.

27:45.818 --> 27:47.920
He is Bell.

27:48.020 --> 27:50.122
And, yeah, girl,
we used to get into all types.

27:50.222 --> 27:51.323
Kerfuffles.

27:51.423 --> 27:53.886
Kerfuffles.

27:53.986 --> 27:56.849
So many "kerfuffly" hijinks.

27:56.949 --> 27:59.811
It was just nice to have
someone in the family

27:59.911 --> 28:01.693
that didn't treat me
like a mistake.

28:01.793 --> 28:04.496
Oh, Catholics--
what are you gonna do?

28:04.596 --> 28:06.258
You remember
that time we brought

28:06.358 --> 28:10.181
the drag queen carollers
to Alicia's Christmas party?

28:10.281 --> 28:13.805
-Bellwether, Vida...
-Qué verguenza.

28:18.810 --> 28:22.153
I should have stayed
in touch when Vida died.

28:22.253 --> 28:25.156
You know, my crazy-ass parents
made that whole mess

28:25.256 --> 28:27.158
20 times more difficult
than it needed to be.

28:27.258 --> 28:29.760
I should have stayed
in touch with you.

28:29.860 --> 28:32.883
You're one of the only people
on the whole Earth

28:32.983 --> 28:34.985
that I actually enjoy.

28:39.029 --> 28:41.391
I heard you moved her grave.

28:42.993 --> 28:44.774
Hey, hey, hey.

28:44.874 --> 28:48.338
Con todo respeto,
she should be where you are.

28:48.438 --> 28:51.501
Yeah, that's what Bell
thought, too.

28:51.601 --> 28:53.703
If I'd have known
it was gonna piss

28:53.803 --> 28:56.386
my puta bitch mother off
that much,

28:56.486 --> 28:58.487
I would have told you
to do it years ago.

29:00.289 --> 29:03.492
Puta bitch!

29:10.459 --> 29:14.463
Oh, you have a little--
you got a little--

29:17.145 --> 29:19.147
Oh.

29:21.029 --> 29:23.612
Ah, ah, ah, you two.

29:23.712 --> 29:25.934
Careful, careful.

29:26.034 --> 29:29.938
Business and pleasure
lead to "fucking."

29:30.038 --> 29:31.659
It's not like that.

29:31.759 --> 29:34.582
-Again with the air quotes.
-Take my grandfather Quique.

29:34.682 --> 29:38.185
He built this huge company
in Cuba,

29:38.285 --> 29:40.948
moved here,
and did it all over again

29:41.048 --> 29:42.990
and almost blew the whole thing

29:43.090 --> 29:45.032
because he had
a wandering pinga.

29:45.132 --> 29:47.635
He was "fucking."

29:47.735 --> 29:49.676
Yes!

29:49.776 --> 29:51.718
She's a smart one.

29:51.818 --> 29:54.561
He was dipping
into the accounts

29:54.661 --> 29:56.483
to pay off paternity claims.

29:56.583 --> 30:00.086
It got so bad my mom was like,
"Le hago la cruz."

30:00.186 --> 30:02.689
She was ready
to show him "the door."

30:02.789 --> 30:05.532
Mm-hmm,
and that's how my parents

30:05.632 --> 30:08.094
took control of the company.

30:08.194 --> 30:10.536
My advice...

30:10.636 --> 30:12.498
enjoy it while you can.

30:12.598 --> 30:14.100
Good advice--

30:14.200 --> 30:15.741
enjoy it...

30:15.841 --> 30:18.864
while...you...can.

30:18.964 --> 30:21.607
-More...Jell-O...shots!
-Oh.

30:23.369 --> 30:27.072
I like you, Miss Millicent.

30:27.172 --> 30:29.915
It just feels like you're
kind of wasted, you know,

30:30.015 --> 30:31.877
all locked up in that home.

30:31.977 --> 30:34.039
And you...

30:34.139 --> 30:36.741
don't you feel a little wasted?

30:37.382 --> 30:39.564
Oh, you mean the crap
with my family?

30:39.664 --> 30:42.607
Oh, it's not crap, Checotah.

30:42.707 --> 30:45.690
They just want
the best for you.

30:45.790 --> 30:47.892
I don't want to run
for Council.

30:47.992 --> 30:50.054
My aunt even tried
to buy me a suit.

30:50.154 --> 30:51.536
I don't look good in suits.

30:51.636 --> 30:55.359
I look like a virgin teenager
at his prom.

30:56.520 --> 30:59.383
Don't you think you say...

30:59.483 --> 31:03.467
"no" to a lot of life?

31:03.567 --> 31:06.770
What if instead
you just said "yes"!

31:09.172 --> 31:11.074
Well, maybe I'm not
the only one

31:11.174 --> 31:14.357
who should be taking
that advice, Miss Millicent.

31:14.457 --> 31:16.720
You know?

31:16.820 --> 31:19.502
I think you can call me Millie.

31:20.463 --> 31:23.486
Oh...

31:23.586 --> 31:28.191
it's hard being a mother,
Checotah.

31:31.714 --> 31:33.856
Well, maybe it's time

31:33.956 --> 31:37.660
for Millie's second act.

31:37.760 --> 31:40.602
You still got some mileage left
on those wheels, right?

31:44.927 --> 31:48.510
Maybe I do, damn it.

31:48.610 --> 31:50.792
I've had a really
nice time tonight.

31:50.892 --> 31:52.894
Me too.

31:55.577 --> 31:56.518
Oh.

31:56.618 --> 31:58.620
Oh, here comes the bad news.

31:59.581 --> 32:01.903
Let's see
what we got going here.

32:59.998 --> 33:01.980
I like her.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.302
I'm glad you moved on.

33:03.402 --> 33:05.704
I told you, it's not like that.

33:05.804 --> 33:08.306
Papi, relax.

33:08.406 --> 33:10.709
My sister died, but...

33:10.809 --> 33:12.810
your heart didn't.

33:13.611 --> 33:14.953
Come on, party animals!

33:15.053 --> 33:17.495
We still have
too much liver left!

33:27.985 --> 33:29.406
Oh!

33:29.506 --> 33:31.609
Excuse me, cutie.

33:31.709 --> 33:33.911
I lost the grip on my pole.

33:39.076 --> 33:41.678
Oh, my God. Is everyone okay?

33:47.804 --> 33:49.025
Oh.

33:49.125 --> 33:51.147
What did you say
to that go-go dancer?

33:51.247 --> 33:54.190
Um... here's 20.

33:54.290 --> 33:57.133
Fall on that guy.

33:59.655 --> 34:03.319
We make a good team.

34:03.419 --> 34:06.362
Yeah, we do.

34:06.462 --> 34:08.944
We really do.

34:10.386 --> 34:12.387
-That was fun.
-Yeah, that was fun.

34:14.349 --> 34:16.952
I don't remember
the last time I had fun.

34:30.565 --> 34:32.607
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.952
I... I, uh--I should go.

34:38.052 --> 34:41.035
Oh, shit.

34:41.135 --> 34:44.578
We need to be at El Calvero
in a few hours.

34:47.061 --> 34:49.062
Yeah.

35:06.679 --> 35:08.681
Good night, Bell.

35:12.925 --> 35:14.927
Good night, Cammie.

35:18.250 --> 35:21.213
The sex doll peanut gallery
does not get an opinion.

35:24.536 --> 35:26.538
665

35:28.820 --> 35:31.363
Ah, there is nothing
more dangerous

35:31.463 --> 35:33.525
than a poorly trained
yet heavily armed

35:33.625 --> 35:36.348
Floridian security guard.

35:39.911 --> 35:41.853
You know, back at the bar
with Ramon,

35:41.953 --> 35:46.658
I saw someone
I'd never seen before...

35:46.758 --> 35:49.861
the old you, and it was good.

35:49.961 --> 35:53.864
It was confident and...

35:53.964 --> 35:56.147
friendly and handsome.

35:56.247 --> 35:58.349
-Handsome?
-Well...

35:58.449 --> 36:00.671
handsome enough.
Don't get distracted.

36:00.771 --> 36:02.853
And courageous and...

36:05.095 --> 36:07.257
Look, without you,
I wouldn't be here either.

36:10.981 --> 36:14.464
So what do you say we finish
what we started, hmm?

36:17.747 --> 36:20.410
All right.

36:20.510 --> 36:23.092
Spin me a yarn, master thief.

36:23.192 --> 36:25.475
What is your plan?

36:28.958 --> 36:30.980
Well, it's...

36:31.080 --> 36:33.082
it's possible
you won't like it.

36:53.742 --> 36:55.904
Ma'am? Ma'am, are you hurt?

37:05.313 --> 37:08.536
Dispatch, we got a situation.

37:08.636 --> 37:11.499
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

37:11.599 --> 37:13.220
I love it.

37:13.320 --> 37:14.742
Are you sure we're
going the right way?

37:14.842 --> 37:15.943
Yes, I'm sure.

37:16.043 --> 37:17.144
You would be, too,

37:17.244 --> 37:18.826
if you didn't spend
the entire tour

37:18.926 --> 37:20.387
getting higher
than Keith Richards.

37:20.487 --> 37:21.708
We toured this?

37:21.808 --> 37:23.810
It's a joke.

37:28.975 --> 37:32.779
It's that one.
Yeah, that's their office.

37:34.340 --> 37:36.483
Vida and I had
our engagement party here.

37:36.583 --> 37:38.685
Then we went to the Yacht Club

37:38.785 --> 37:42.748
for champagne and some
depressingly amateur ceviche.

37:51.597 --> 37:53.819
No. Oh, no.

37:53.919 --> 37:55.421
No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:55.521 --> 37:59.344
In case you hadn't noticed,
we are mid-felony right now.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.747
I was wrong. I can't do this.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.989
No, wait--Ugh.

38:04.089 --> 38:05.991
Oh, my God.

38:06.091 --> 38:08.954
Bell, get up. Come on.

38:09.054 --> 38:10.275
What about that thing I said--

38:10.375 --> 38:12.277
about how I wouldn't be here
without you?

38:12.377 --> 38:14.038
I mean, doesn't that
mean anything?

38:14.138 --> 38:16.241
Frankly, no.

38:16.341 --> 38:19.023
Great.

38:22.386 --> 38:26.570
Bell, I need you to get
through this password, okay?

38:26.670 --> 38:29.213
Well, it's not far
down to paradise

38:29.313 --> 38:30.774
Are you singing right now?

38:30.874 --> 38:32.376
At least it's not for me

38:32.476 --> 38:35.219
And if the wind is right,
you can sail away

38:35.319 --> 38:36.860
Oh, you're seriously singing.

38:36.960 --> 38:39.503
-Find tranquility
-Okay.

38:39.603 --> 38:43.266
Oh, the canvas can do miracles

38:43.366 --> 38:45.468
Just you wait and see

38:45.568 --> 38:47.570
Vida loved that song.

38:50.613 --> 38:53.236
Here.

38:53.336 --> 38:56.479
Skramstad sent this.

38:56.579 --> 38:58.201
It's a password breaker.

38:58.301 --> 38:59.962
He calls it
the Preacher's Daughter.

39:00.062 --> 39:01.804
Why does he call it
the Preacher's Daughter?

39:01.904 --> 39:04.567
-You get lucky every time.
-Oh.

39:04.667 --> 39:07.810
I know it's misogynistic
but in a humorous way.

39:07.910 --> 39:09.912
There's nowhere
to plug this in.

39:11.353 --> 39:14.496
Oh, the canvas can do miracles

39:14.596 --> 39:17.099
Just you wait and see

39:17.199 --> 39:19.141
Believe me

39:19.241 --> 39:20.742
Oh.

39:20.842 --> 39:23.445
It's not far
to never-never land

39:28.890 --> 39:30.031
Hi.

39:30.131 --> 39:32.634
Lady Florida cop. Hva skjer?

39:32.734 --> 39:33.995
What's up?

39:34.095 --> 39:35.997
Uh, this box thing
that you gave Bell.

39:36.097 --> 39:37.678
Ah, yes,
the Preacher's Daughter.

39:37.778 --> 39:39.560
Okay. Well, it--

39:39.660 --> 39:41.202
'Cause you get lucky
every time.

39:41.302 --> 39:43.084
I know.

39:43.184 --> 39:44.445
It's a good one, yes?

39:44.545 --> 39:45.846
Just say yes.

39:45.946 --> 39:47.047
Yeah.

39:47.147 --> 39:48.689
Yeah, it's fine,
but there's no port.

39:48.789 --> 39:50.691
I can't--
I can't plug it in, so...

39:50.791 --> 39:53.373
Where's Bellwether?

39:53.473 --> 39:56.536
Currently writhing
on the floor.

39:56.636 --> 39:58.258
Okay.

39:58.358 --> 39:59.699
Yeah.

39:59.799 --> 40:01.621
We'll do this old school.

40:01.721 --> 40:03.783
Are there any photos
near the computer?

40:03.883 --> 40:06.106
Okay, show me.

40:06.206 --> 40:08.628
Fantasy

40:08.728 --> 40:11.871
It gets the best of me

40:11.971 --> 40:13.713
Anything?

40:13.813 --> 40:16.716
Wait. Stop. The dog.

40:16.816 --> 40:18.197
What's the dog's name?

40:18.297 --> 40:19.839
Okay, Bell, Bell,
what's the dog's name?

40:19.939 --> 40:22.361
-Moose.
-Moose.

40:22.461 --> 40:23.402
-Horrible dog.
-Moose.

40:23.502 --> 40:25.924
Endless slobberer.

40:26.024 --> 40:30.108
Okay, try Moose123.

40:32.671 --> 40:34.913
Try Moose1234.

40:36.995 --> 40:39.417
Okay.

40:39.517 --> 40:41.519
Skramstad, thank you,
seriously.

40:43.962 --> 40:45.984
All right, so if the workers
really did get sick,

40:46.084 --> 40:48.786
then we need their files

40:48.886 --> 40:52.209
to prove that we're not crazy.

40:54.452 --> 40:57.334
To prove some of us
aren't crazy.

41:00.497 --> 41:03.540
Okay, okay.
That--that's something.

41:10.067 --> 41:12.068
Okay.

41:14.671 --> 41:18.295
I hope
you're the chicken dinner.

41:18.395 --> 41:20.557
Let's check the trash.

41:25.041 --> 41:28.144
Bell? Bell?

41:28.244 --> 41:31.667
It looks like they tested
the soil at the sugar plant.

41:31.767 --> 41:33.309
It looks bad.

41:33.409 --> 41:35.231
Bad--how bad?

41:35.331 --> 41:39.555
Like poison bad.

41:39.655 --> 41:40.836
What the hell is mill mud?

41:40.936 --> 41:42.978
Mill mud!

41:49.064 --> 41:52.007
783

41:52.107 --> 41:53.368
Where is the exit?

41:53.468 --> 41:54.769
What happened?

41:54.869 --> 41:57.212
I paid attention on the tour.
Why didn't you?

41:57.312 --> 41:59.334
Hey, I got us
up here, didn't I?

41:59.434 --> 42:03.458
Oh, congratulations on 50%
of an outstanding job!

42:03.558 --> 42:05.460
I'm sorry.

42:05.560 --> 42:07.561
I'm lashing out,
due to anxiety.

42:09.483 --> 42:11.746
It's a byproduct of
processing and treating sugar.

42:11.846 --> 42:13.667
-What? What is?
-Mill mud.

42:13.767 --> 42:15.749
Since it's free
and nutrient-dense,

42:15.849 --> 42:18.232
people reapply it to the field
as a fertiliser,

42:18.332 --> 42:19.633
but if you use too much,

42:19.733 --> 42:22.156
the soil builds up
toxic traces of heavy metal.

42:22.256 --> 42:24.037
And traces of that shit
can get folks sick?

42:24.137 --> 42:26.580
Oh, traces of that shit can
get folks incredibly sick.

42:32.465 --> 42:35.448
It's cane syrup.
There's nothing to see here.

42:35.548 --> 42:37.630
Let's find another way out.

42:55.768 --> 42:57.950
Why would Yasiel be helping
with a delivery?

42:58.050 --> 43:00.312
I don't know.
Learning the trade?

43:00.412 --> 43:02.274
Rich people are weird.
Let's go.

43:02.374 --> 43:04.396
Sheriff Grant was right.

43:04.496 --> 43:06.438
We'll call him from the road
to congratulate him.

43:06.538 --> 43:09.521
-We have what we came for.
-No, I need evidence.

43:09.621 --> 43:12.323
This is not our problem.

43:12.423 --> 43:15.887
Hey, look, maybe
I'm just a former cop,

43:15.987 --> 43:18.489
and you're just...
you're just a weirdo,

43:18.589 --> 43:20.812
or maybe tonight,

43:20.912 --> 43:23.774
just maybe...
we're more than that.

43:23.874 --> 43:27.098
Cammie, I want to go home.

43:27.198 --> 43:29.620
And I want my job back.

43:29.720 --> 43:32.222
I don't even know
why I want it back, but I do.

43:32.322 --> 43:34.645
I'm going in that truck
with or without you.

43:59.028 --> 44:01.030
He handed him something.

44:04.994 --> 44:07.616
This is it.

44:07.716 --> 44:10.259
This is the case.
Whatever else we get,

44:10.359 --> 44:12.301
Sheriff Grant has 'em
by the balls with this.

44:12.401 --> 44:14.062
Heroin tastes bitter.

44:14.162 --> 44:15.744
Cocaine
will numb your soft tissue.

44:15.844 --> 44:17.846
Yeah.

44:21.650 --> 44:24.272
-It's sugar.
-Sugar?

44:24.372 --> 44:26.935
Why would they be hiding sugar?

44:28.696 --> 44:30.698
Sugaring their rum.

44:33.381 --> 44:37.405
Adding granulated sugar
is a cheat to mimic aged rum.

44:37.505 --> 44:39.887
It's unethical,
it's disgusting,

44:39.987 --> 44:42.610
but, legally,
it's barely misdemeanour fraud.

44:42.710 --> 44:45.733
So this was nothing?

44:45.833 --> 44:49.216
Just a couple of douchebags
ruining perfectly good rum?

44:49.316 --> 44:51.098
We have the computer files.

44:51.198 --> 44:53.580
That's your victory.
We're done.

44:53.680 --> 44:54.861
I can't believe this.

44:54.961 --> 44:57.304
We will workshop
our feelings in the car.

44:57.404 --> 44:59.406
-Let's go.
-Okay, fine.

45:03.450 --> 45:05.512
Officer Lorde.

45:05.612 --> 45:08.835
There's a vehicle crashed
outside my factory

45:08.935 --> 45:11.998
with what appears to be
a sexual apparatus

45:12.098 --> 45:13.760
at the wheel.

45:13.860 --> 45:16.682
I hope you have
a good babysitter...

45:16.782 --> 45:18.784
because it's gonna be
a long night.
