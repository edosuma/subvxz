00:04.053 --> 00:06.221
<i>on a noble search
for true love.</i>

00:06.222 --> 00:08.790
<i>In this one, I'm just a jerk.</i>

00:08.791 --> 00:13.428
Well, guys,
tonight is the night.

00:13.429 --> 00:16.129
to see my antique
camera collection.

00:16.131 --> 00:17.332
Ah!
It's Ted's bait.

00:17.333 --> 00:18.399
"Bait"?

00:18.400 --> 00:20.635
A true gentleman
invents a pretense

00:20.636 --> 00:22.937
to lure an honorable lady
into his apartment.

00:22.938 --> 00:25.406
Some item of interest
or beauty you can both

00:25.407 --> 00:26.908
pretend to admire
for five minutes

00:26.909 --> 00:29.377
before she hops
on your disco stick.

00:29.378 --> 00:30.945
Like she's coming up
to "borrow a book"

00:30.946 --> 00:32.981
or "check out an album
on vinyl."

00:32.982 --> 00:34.315
Or to see your
new rap poster.

00:34.316 --> 00:36.050
"Rap poster"?

00:36.051 --> 00:37.285
Who would that work on?

00:37.286 --> 00:39.454
It was the first
week of college.

00:39.455 --> 00:41.422
I was really
into Wu-Tang Clan.

00:42.391 --> 00:43.925
Yeah, bait is tricky.

00:43.926 --> 00:46.694
It has to be something interesting
enough to get the girl upstairs,

00:46.695 --> 00:49.030
but not so interesting
that it overpowers the night.

00:49.031 --> 00:51.432
<i>BARNEY: I found that a
slot machine was too fun.</i>

00:51.433 --> 00:53.635
(coins clinking)
(yelling)

00:55.137 --> 00:56.904
<i>And a trampoline...</i>

00:56.905 --> 00:59.907
turned out to be too dangerous.

01:00.809 --> 01:03.344
<i>But then I found
the perfect bait:</i>

01:03.345 --> 01:05.580
<i>a teacup pig.</i>

01:07.449 --> 01:09.651
"A teacup pig"?
Who's that working on?

01:09.652 --> 01:11.819
You have a teacup pig?! I
didn't know you had a teacup pig!

01:11.820 --> 01:12.787
Can we see the teacup pig?!

01:12.788 --> 01:15.056
Hey, can I borrow
your teacup pig?

01:15.057 --> 01:17.091
Yes, you can borrow
my teacup pig.

01:17.092 --> 01:18.693
You have a teacup pig?!
Oh, my gosh!

01:18.694 --> 01:19.961
I can't believe
you have a teacup pig!

01:19.962 --> 01:21.062
You're just so cute!

01:21.063 --> 01:23.231
Yes, you are the cutest
piggy ever!

01:23.232 --> 01:25.099
What?

01:25.100 --> 01:26.734
Were you always this pretty?

01:26.735 --> 01:28.269
Or are you going
to give me that whole,

01:28.270 --> 01:30.905
"Oh, in high school I was
really shy and awkward" line?

01:30.906 --> 01:32.807
<i>I was shy and awkward.</i>

01:32.808 --> 01:34.342
I was, like,
a hundred pounds heavier

01:34.343 --> 01:36.944
and I had these crazy
buck teeth. Seriously?

01:36.945 --> 01:39.247
No, I've always been hot.

01:39.248 --> 01:41.849
What are you going to do?
(chuckles)

01:44.053 --> 01:46.120
Do you know who else
would love this teacup pig?

01:46.121 --> 01:47.789
Hmm?

01:47.790 --> 01:49.524
My boyfriend.

02:04.206 --> 02:05.306
You have a boyfriend?

02:05.307 --> 02:06.474
Ugh, I know.

02:06.475 --> 02:08.609
So annoying, right?
I mean, he's

02:08.610 --> 02:10.411
<i>not really my boyfriend.</i>

02:10.412 --> 02:12.347
Oh, good.
I mean,

02:12.348 --> 02:14.048
technically, he kind of is.

02:14.049 --> 02:15.783
Well, is he or isn't he?

02:15.784 --> 02:19.153
Some of both,
but definitely not either.

02:19.154 --> 02:21.122
Are you getting any of this?

02:22.257 --> 02:24.625
Look, I really like you.

02:24.626 --> 02:26.794
I just need you
to be patient.

02:26.795 --> 02:30.631
I don't want to lose you,
Big Brown Eyes.

02:32.668 --> 02:35.503
Yup. Somebody doesn't
want to lose

02:35.504 --> 02:36.971
Big Brown Eyes.

02:36.972 --> 02:38.539
ROBIN:
Oh, Ted.

02:38.540 --> 02:40.575
She's got you
on the hook.

02:40.576 --> 02:42.610
What? What?
I'm not on the hook.

02:42.611 --> 02:44.779
Oh, you are totally on the hook.

02:44.780 --> 02:46.280
She's stringing
you along.

02:46.281 --> 02:47.715
She's not
committing to you,

02:47.716 --> 02:49.717
but she's keeping you
around just in case,

02:49.718 --> 02:52.987
like an old can of chili
in the pantry.

02:52.988 --> 02:54.322
Um, who's buying
canned chili

02:54.323 --> 02:57.392
and not eating it
immediately? Amen, sister.

02:58.827 --> 03:00.461
Ted, don't feel bad.
We've all been there.

03:00.462 --> 03:01.596
I've been on both
sides of it.

03:01.597 --> 03:03.164
I've been a hookey
and a hooker.

03:03.165 --> 03:04.599
Move past it, guys.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.200
I've been a little
bit loose,

03:06.201 --> 03:08.069
but money never
changed hands.

03:08.871 --> 03:10.671
I've been on the hook.

03:10.672 --> 03:12.740
Lisa Walker.
Picture it:

03:12.741 --> 03:16.411
1994, St. Cloud, Minnesota.

03:16.412 --> 03:19.981
So I was, like,
thinking, Lisa-

03:19.982 --> 03:24.752
do you maybe want to,
like, go out with me?

03:24.753 --> 03:27.188
That sounds great.

03:27.189 --> 03:29.257
But I'm sort
of seeing this guy.

03:29.258 --> 03:30.525
He's got
a LeBaron convertible

03:30.526 --> 03:32.093
and an "in"
at the roller rink,

03:32.094 --> 03:34.262
so I'd hate
to burn that bridge.

03:35.864 --> 03:38.399
I understand.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.034
But how about this?

03:40.035 --> 03:41.636
You can be
my secret boyfriend

03:41.637 --> 03:43.271
who does all my
homework for me.

03:46.241 --> 03:47.775
A'ight.

03:48.677 --> 03:50.945
You want to see
my rap poster?

03:50.946 --> 03:52.814
Poster whore.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.382
MARSHALL:
Anyway...

03:54.383 --> 03:57.084
Lisa Walker strung me
along for months

03:57.085 --> 04:00.354
until one night,
I went to go tell her

04:00.355 --> 04:01.656
how much I loved her.

04:01.657 --> 04:02.857
BOTH: Aww. Hmm. Ugh.

04:02.858 --> 04:04.058
In song.

04:04.059 --> 04:05.393
(all groaning)

04:05.394 --> 04:06.661
<i>MARSHALL:
She wasn't home yet,</i>

04:06.662 --> 04:08.896
<i>so I waited.</i>

04:10.332 --> 04:12.567
<i>And waited.</i>

04:13.735 --> 04:17.137
<i>I woke up four hours later,
covered in snow.</i>

04:17.139 --> 04:19.173
<i>And that's when I saw it.</i>

04:20.976 --> 04:22.643
<i>Lisa's footsteps.</i>

04:22.644 --> 04:25.980
<i>She had walked right over me
and into the house.</i>

04:27.416 --> 04:29.016
It was the best thing
that could have happened.

04:29.017 --> 04:30.485
It got me off her hook.

04:30.486 --> 04:32.019
<i>Okay, that is
definitely not</i>

04:32.020 --> 04:33.488
what's going on
with me and Tiffany.

04:33.489 --> 04:34.822
Listen to this.

04:34.823 --> 04:37.925
I'm really into you.

04:37.926 --> 04:41.362
I just can't be
with you right now.

04:42.297 --> 04:44.131
Huh?! Huh?!

04:44.132 --> 04:46.834
Ted, "right no"
is the classic

04:46.835 --> 04:48.436
on-the-hook catchphrase.
MARSHALL: Yup.

04:48.437 --> 04:51.272
"Right now" paints a picture of
some sort of magical future time

04:51.273 --> 04:52.373
when everything will work out,

04:52.374 --> 04:55.309
but the truth is,
that will never happen.

04:55.310 --> 04:56.210
BARNEY:
It's like this.

04:56.211 --> 04:59.080
"I can't be with you." Boom!

04:59.081 --> 05:00.648
"Right now."

05:00.649 --> 05:02.783
(creaking)

05:03.752 --> 05:04.852
LILY:
Yeah.

05:04.853 --> 05:06.521
I think my high school
boyfriend, Scooter,

05:06.522 --> 05:08.256
is still sort of
on the hook for me.

05:08.257 --> 05:10.324
Sort of?
He totally is.

05:10.325 --> 05:13.160
The poor guy showed up at our
wedding hoping to win you back.

05:13.161 --> 05:14.428
LILY:
Yeah.

05:14.429 --> 05:15.563
It's still sometimes weird

05:15.564 --> 05:17.632
when I see him at work.
Wait. What?

05:18.534 --> 05:20.568
Scooter works in
the school cafeteria.

05:20.569 --> 05:22.036
We've talked about this.

05:22.037 --> 05:23.671
Hey, Lily.
Nice dress.

05:23.672 --> 05:25.506
Tater-tots?

05:25.507 --> 05:27.441
(mouthing)

05:29.344 --> 05:31.512
We most certainly have
not talked about this!

05:31.513 --> 05:32.680
Yes, we have.

05:32.681 --> 05:34.515
I've mentioned it
tons of times.

05:34.516 --> 05:36.384
"Lunch Lady Scooter."

05:36.385 --> 05:38.386
I thought that
you were referring

05:38.387 --> 05:41.088
to some sort of long overdue
device that carries around

05:41.089 --> 05:43.758
those poor,
underappreciated lunch ladies!

05:43.759 --> 05:46.193
This explains a lot.

05:46.194 --> 05:48.763
Lunch Lady Scooter
was there again today.

05:48.764 --> 05:51.232
Oh, yeah? Did you
jump on that thing?

05:51.233 --> 05:53.501
Give it a ride?
No!

05:53.502 --> 05:55.937
Really? If it were me,
I'd be riding that scooter

05:55.938 --> 05:58.906
all day long until I broke
that thang in half.

05:59.942 --> 06:02.476
So those poor women still
have to walk everywhere?

06:03.312 --> 06:05.479
Wait. Scooter is working
at your school?!

06:05.480 --> 06:08.082
Are you jealous?

06:08.083 --> 06:10.284
No, I just feel bad
for Scooter.

06:10.285 --> 06:11.919
'Cause the only reason
he took that job

06:11.920 --> 06:13.254
is he thinks
he has a shot with you.

06:13.255 --> 06:15.222
You have to make it clear
that he doesn't,

06:15.223 --> 06:17.491
so that he can move on
and a real lunch lady

06:17.492 --> 06:19.327
can get her
job back. Damn!

06:19.328 --> 06:21.195
I've tried.

06:21.196 --> 06:22.697
Hey, Lily.

06:22.698 --> 06:26.133
I saw you had seventh period
free. So do I.

06:26.134 --> 06:27.802
You want to run away together?

06:27.803 --> 06:30.504
Let me be clear, Scooter.

06:30.505 --> 06:34.542
There is no way you and I
can ever be together.

06:42.818 --> 06:44.218
Right now.

06:44.219 --> 06:45.519
I'll see you tomorrow, Lily.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.455
It's Tijuana Tuesday.

06:48.824 --> 06:51.459
"Right now"?

06:51.460 --> 06:52.827
You right-now'd Scooter?

06:52.828 --> 06:55.630
You need to let Scooter
off the hook once and for all.

06:55.631 --> 06:56.697
LILY:
You're right.

06:56.698 --> 06:57.832
Day after tomorrow,

06:57.833 --> 06:59.333
that's exactly what
I'm going to do.

06:59.334 --> 07:00.668
Why not tomorrow?

07:00.669 --> 07:03.838
Baby, I can't ruin
Tijuana Tuesday.

07:05.340 --> 07:06.807
Really?

07:06.808 --> 07:09.610
You're really going to sit here
all night watching the door

07:09.611 --> 07:12.446
because Tiffany said
she'll "try to stop by"?

07:12.447 --> 07:14.782
Barney, I'm not going
to just give up on her.

07:14.783 --> 07:17.051
NARRATOR:
I should have given up on her.

07:17.052 --> 07:19.520
This girl is special.

07:19.521 --> 07:22.023
<i>She was the devil.</i>

07:22.024 --> 07:24.291
Things are going
to work out with Tiffany.

07:24.292 --> 07:26.894
<i>No, they're not, dumbass.</i>

07:26.895 --> 07:30.431
Ted, let me be clear:
this girl is a poison

07:30.432 --> 07:33.334
and you need to cut her
out of your life forever.

07:34.870 --> 07:36.804
Hey, there she is.

07:39.441 --> 07:41.575
Oh, she brought
some of her coworkers.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.448
Hang on to this girl, Ted.

07:47.449 --> 07:49.650
Hang on to her
and never let go!

07:56.302 --> 07:58.603
these are some of the
hottest girls I've ever seen.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.138
And they all work with Tiffany?

08:00.139 --> 08:02.107
Yup.
There could only be

08:02.108 --> 08:04.175
one explanation for this.

08:04.176 --> 08:06.211
Ted...

08:06.212 --> 08:07.879
is Tiffany a ph-ph-ph...

08:07.880 --> 08:10.215
pharmaceutical sales rep?

08:10.216 --> 08:11.383
Yeah, how did you know that?

08:11.384 --> 08:12.417
And you never thought

08:12.418 --> 08:14.586
to mention that?

08:14.587 --> 08:16.421
What? It's just a job.

08:16.422 --> 08:17.756
(stammers)

08:17.757 --> 08:20.725
Just a j... just a jah...

08:21.727 --> 08:23.728
Ted, throughout time

08:23.729 --> 08:26.064
there has always been one
cutting-edge profession

08:26.065 --> 08:28.967
to which hot girls,
like Tiffany, have flocked.

08:28.968 --> 08:30.235
Shall I walk you
through the history?

08:30.236 --> 08:31.936
I'm gonna explicitly say no.

08:31.937 --> 08:35.206
It all started
2.5 million years ago.

08:35.207 --> 08:37.308
<i>BARNEY:
Man was a hunter.</i>

08:37.308 --> 08:40.211
<i>So, the hottest
profession of the day?</i>

08:40.212 --> 08:41.312
<i>Gatherer.</i>

08:41.313 --> 08:43.748
Homo erectus indeed.

08:46.585 --> 08:48.353
<i>As man mastered technology,</i>

08:48.354 --> 08:50.855
<i>the hottest profession
of the day evolved.</i>

08:50.856 --> 08:52.424
I'm pretty sure
it's a hernia.

08:52.425 --> 08:54.592
Can you check again?

08:57.530 --> 09:00.165
<i>And then,
man took to the skies.</i>

09:00.166 --> 09:02.734
<i>And so, hot women
put on high heels</i>

09:02.735 --> 09:04.269
<i>and became stewardesses.</i>

09:05.704 --> 09:08.473
I am in the upright
and locked position.

09:11.710 --> 09:14.946
And then man said,
"Life is hard.

09:14.947 --> 09:17.415
I should start taking
lotsf prescription drugs."

09:17.416 --> 09:18.583
And so, hot girls

09:18.584 --> 09:20.318
rolled into doctors' offices,

09:20.319 --> 09:22.787
looking sexy enough to render
the very erection pills

09:22.788 --> 09:24.422
they peddled
ironically redundant.

09:24.423 --> 09:25.623
So now,

09:25.624 --> 09:27.559
pharma girls are today's

09:27.560 --> 09:28.960
hottest profession.

09:30.062 --> 09:32.597
Hey, Big Brown Eyes.
How you doing?

09:32.598 --> 09:34.799
I'm good.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.201
Hey, by the way, you, uh,

09:36.202 --> 09:38.203
you ditch that
loser boyfriend yet?

09:38.204 --> 09:39.838
No, sir.

09:42.842 --> 09:44.576
Touched my nose.

09:44.577 --> 09:48.113
Dude, ditch Tiffany
and join the Barnacle

09:48.114 --> 09:50.014
in a pharma girl free-for-all.

09:50.015 --> 09:52.684
Side effects may include
loss of clothing, rug burn,

09:52.685 --> 09:55.220
shortness of breath and sore
abdominals the next morning.

09:55.221 --> 09:57.188
What in the world is up?!

09:59.125 --> 10:01.826
Hey. So...

10:01.827 --> 10:03.461
I know that you've
been having trouble

10:03.462 --> 10:05.296
letting Scooter off the hook.

10:05.297 --> 10:07.599
Well, I decided what you need
is practice.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.635
Now, you say the problem
is his cute, sad eyes?

10:11.337 --> 10:12.737
Well...

10:16.375 --> 10:18.376
Aww!

10:19.578 --> 10:20.645
All right, shut it, woman.

10:20.646 --> 10:23.181
Now, I want you
to look at this

10:23.182 --> 10:26.217
teacup pig and tell him
that there's no way

10:26.218 --> 10:28.319
that you could ever be with him.

10:31.190 --> 10:35.126
Teacup Pig, there is no way

10:35.127 --> 10:37.428
I can ever be with you.

10:45.504 --> 10:46.671
Right now.

10:46.672 --> 10:48.439
Oh, come on!
Grow a pair!

10:48.440 --> 10:50.441
I'm sorry, but he's

10:50.442 --> 10:52.610
just so freakin' cute.

10:52.611 --> 10:55.013
I just want to cuddle him
all day long.

10:55.014 --> 10:57.048
Yes, I do.
You know that's funny.

10:57.049 --> 10:59.651
I remember when you used to say
things like that about me.

10:59.652 --> 11:01.152
Oh, I still do.

11:01.153 --> 11:03.888
Yeah, not as much, Lily.

11:03.889 --> 11:05.890
Not as much.

11:07.159 --> 11:08.359
(laughs)

11:08.360 --> 11:10.061
âª Ain't no party like
a pharma girl party âª

11:10.062 --> 11:12.030
âª 'Cause a pharma girl
party don't stop! âª

11:12.031 --> 11:14.766
Dude, I have already hooked
up with three of them.

11:14.767 --> 11:15.934
Fantasmo.

11:15.935 --> 11:17.869
Plus, my cholesterol
is down.

11:17.870 --> 11:19.404
My restless legs
syndrome is cured.

11:19.405 --> 11:21.372
I've never felt
more alive- oh.

11:21.373 --> 11:24.108
Guys, great news.

11:24.109 --> 11:25.810
Tiffany broke up
with her boyfriend.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.245
Proof that I am
not on the hook.

11:27.246 --> 11:28.680
Oh, you're still on the
hook. (Lily chuckles)

11:28.681 --> 11:32.016
Ah, uh-uh, listen
to how we spent last night.

11:32.017 --> 11:34.219
<i>First, we cuddled.</i>

11:36.088 --> 11:40.124
Then, we shared chocolate cake.

11:40.125 --> 11:43.895
<i>Then, well, I don't usually
join in on locker room talk,</i>

11:43.896 --> 11:48.233
<i>but I gave her
a pretty sensual foot rub.</i>

11:49.435 --> 11:54.339
And let me guess: it didn't
go any further than that.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.506
Well, no, but...

11:55.507 --> 11:57.508
And tell me,
did you by any chance

11:57.509 --> 11:59.177
make that chocolate cake?

11:59.178 --> 12:01.346
It was a mix.

12:01.347 --> 12:02.313
Dude.

12:02.314 --> 12:04.616
There's no shame
in admitting it, Ted.

12:04.617 --> 12:06.551
We've all been
on people's hooks

12:06.552 --> 12:08.953
and we've all kept
someone on the hook.

12:08.954 --> 12:10.855
Um, I most certainly
have not.

12:10.856 --> 12:11.923
(scoffing):
What?!

12:11.924 --> 12:13.157
Are you joking?

12:13.158 --> 12:16.327
What about that girl from
the university library?

12:16.328 --> 12:17.929
Um, Henrietta?

12:17.930 --> 12:20.031
Henrietta and I
are just friends.

12:20.032 --> 12:22.233
Oh, she is so
on your hook.

12:22.234 --> 12:24.002
Absolutely not.

12:24.003 --> 12:25.703
<i>NARRATOR:
She totally was.</i>

12:25.704 --> 12:26.904
<i>I mean...</i>

12:26.905 --> 12:28.673
<i>we cuddled.</i>

12:28.674 --> 12:31.276
(sighs)

12:31.277 --> 12:34.012
<i>We shared chocolate cake.</i>

12:34.013 --> 12:35.546
(chuckles)

12:35.547 --> 12:38.316
<i>She gave me foot rubs-
long ones.</i>

12:38.317 --> 12:40.885
<i>I'm not proud, kids.</i>

12:40.886 --> 12:42.654
You like having Henrietta
around for the same reason

12:42.655 --> 12:44.756
that Tiffany likes
having you around:

12:44.757 --> 12:46.958
it's a nice
little ego boost.

12:46.959 --> 12:48.359
No wonder
you're such an expert

12:48.360 --> 12:50.194
about keeping people
on the hook.

12:50.195 --> 12:52.430
What about that poor
camera guy you work with?

12:52.431 --> 12:54.098
Mike and I are
just friends.

12:54.099 --> 12:55.800
Come on.

12:55.801 --> 12:57.535
Mmm...

12:57.536 --> 13:00.338
Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.

13:00.339 --> 13:01.706
Robin, have you
ever thought

13:01.707 --> 13:03.941
about taking us
to the next level?

13:03.942 --> 13:05.610
Well, if you're talking
about doing my laundry,

13:05.611 --> 13:06.711
I'm on board.

13:06.712 --> 13:08.179
You got yourself a deal.

13:08.180 --> 13:09.847
Hmm.

13:09.848 --> 13:10.848
What?!

13:10.849 --> 13:12.917
I- I am not keeping
Mike on the hook.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.752
You are Captain Hook.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.287
Dude, I'm a girl.

13:16.288 --> 13:18.790
Okayour girl parts
are like a spiderweb.

13:18.791 --> 13:20.858
Sometimes you're gonna
catch stuff you don't want.

13:20.859 --> 13:22.393
That doesn't

13:22.394 --> 13:23.494
make it okay.

13:23.495 --> 13:25.730
Oh, a-and Henrietta
is in, in no way

13:25.731 --> 13:27.165
wasting her time
with you, right?

13:27.166 --> 13:29.133
Henrietta knows
that we're just friends.

13:29.134 --> 13:30.835
In fact,
I'm gonna call her up

13:30.836 --> 13:34.038
and hang out with her tonight
as friends.

13:34.039 --> 13:35.540
Hey, Ted.
Hey.

13:35.541 --> 13:36.774
I love you.

13:36.775 --> 13:38.376
What?
Uh, do you want a foot massage?

13:38.377 --> 13:40.545
'Cause I've been practicing
on myself.

13:40.546 --> 13:42.580
No, I'm good.

13:42.581 --> 13:44.048
I didn't know
if you were hungry,

13:44.049 --> 13:46.417
so I just threw together some...
it's not a big deal.

13:46.418 --> 13:49.087
<i>Kids, looking back,
I don't know how I didn't see</i>

13:49.088 --> 13:51.222
<i>that Henrietta was madly
in love with me.</i>

13:51.223 --> 13:52.290
(phone rings)

13:52.291 --> 13:54.926
Oh.

13:54.927 --> 13:56.961
Hello.
Hey, Ted.

13:56.962 --> 13:57.962
Hey, Tiffany.

13:57.963 --> 13:58.930
I'm going out of town

13:58.931 --> 13:59.964
this weekend
for my friend's wedding.

13:59.965 --> 14:02.400
Want to be my date?

14:02.401 --> 14:03.668
I would love to.

14:03.669 --> 14:05.136
Hey, what are you doing
right now?

14:05.137 --> 14:06.904
Oh, God, no.

14:06.905 --> 14:09.307
Awesome. Okay, I'll see you
in, like, ten minutes?

14:09.308 --> 14:10.608
Great.

14:10.609 --> 14:12.310
Soy, Henrietta,

14:12.311 --> 14:13.344
something came up.

14:13.345 --> 14:15.279
Take a rain check, pal?

14:15.280 --> 14:16.748
Yeah, it's no problem.

14:16.749 --> 14:18.616
All right, yeah, hey-ho.
Oh, you're strong.

14:18.617 --> 14:21.419
<i>What a jerk.</i>

14:22.221 --> 14:24.088
Henrietta, I...

14:24.089 --> 14:25.890
Wait. Where
did Ted go?

14:25.891 --> 14:27.592
I thought we were finally
going to get to meet him.

14:27.593 --> 14:28.793
Yeah, something came up,
okay, Mom?

14:28.794 --> 14:32.397
I told you
there was no Ted.

14:32.398 --> 14:34.899
I heard that.

14:39.073 --> 14:41.074
<i>So there I was,
at one of the surest signs</i>

14:41.075 --> 14:43.477
<i>of taking a relationship
to the next level:</i>

14:43.478 --> 14:45.278
<i>an out-of-town wedding.</i>

14:45.279 --> 14:46.713
<i>It was finally happening.</i>

14:46.714 --> 14:47.981
Champagne?

14:47.982 --> 14:50.917
Ted, oh, my gosh,
I forgot to call you.

14:50.918 --> 14:52.352
Well, whatever it is
you wanted to talk about,

14:52.353 --> 14:53.687
we can talk about it now.

14:55.757 --> 14:56.790
This is Jack.

14:56.791 --> 14:58.492
He's the best man
at the wedding.

14:58.493 --> 15:00.661
We just got back together.

15:00.662 --> 15:01.962
You know, now that
I think about it,

15:01.963 --> 15:03.730
a phone call
would have been nice.

15:03.731 --> 15:06.667
You're Ted? Ouch.

15:06.668 --> 15:09.536
But I hear you make
a mean chocolate cake.

15:12.340 --> 15:14.041
Oh, isn't he great?

15:14.042 --> 15:16.376
And he's in a band.
(squeals)

15:16.377 --> 15:19.046
Thanks.

15:19.047 --> 15:21.348
Come on, Lily. You have
to get Scooter off the hook.

15:21.349 --> 15:22.516
Now, try again.

15:22.517 --> 15:25.886
Teacup Pig, oh...

15:26.888 --> 15:28.622
I don't want to be with you.

15:35.530 --> 15:36.997
Right now.

15:36.998 --> 15:39.399
Man up!

15:40.234 --> 15:43.804
Teacup Pig...

15:43.805 --> 15:45.772
I don't want to be with you.

15:50.478 --> 15:51.978
Ever.

15:51.979 --> 15:53.380
Finish him!

15:53.381 --> 15:55.415
We will never be together

15:55.416 --> 15:58.385
in any sort of sexual way
ever again.

15:58.386 --> 15:59.553
Nice.

15:59.554 --> 16:02.022
Sort of a weird thing
to say to a pig.

16:02.023 --> 16:03.190
It felt really wrong.

16:04.992 --> 16:07.360
Anyway, I just don't think
you and I are going to work.

16:07.962 --> 16:09.930
(whispers):
Right now.

16:09.931 --> 16:12.132
<i>NARRATOR:
And that's when it hit me.</i>

16:12.133 --> 16:13.433
<i>I was on the hook.</i>

16:13.434 --> 16:14.935
<i>I also realized...</i>

16:14.936 --> 16:17.204
I missed this
so much, baby.

16:17.205 --> 16:19.206
<i>...Tiffany was
on this guy's hook.</i>

16:19.207 --> 16:20.640
<i>It was a vicious cycle.</i>

16:20.641 --> 16:22.209
<i>Henrietta was on my hook.</i>

16:22.210 --> 16:24.444
<i>And years later, I found out
this poor bastard</i>

16:24.445 --> 16:26.012
<i>was on Henrietta's hook.</i>

16:28.916 --> 16:30.617
You know what?

16:30.618 --> 16:33.220
We're not going to work ever.

16:34.222 --> 16:35.989
I'm done.

16:38.793 --> 16:40.627
And it's really better
for the circulation

16:40.628 --> 16:42.696
if you knead the arches
with your thumbs.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.197
Now, I'm done.

16:46.901 --> 16:49.703
Marshall, I can
do this by myself.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.304
Okay, well, then prove it.

16:52.273 --> 16:54.274
And, um...

16:54.275 --> 16:56.309
Grab me a pudding.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.881
Listen up, Scooter.

17:00.882 --> 17:04.050
There is no way
you and I will ever be together.

17:11.692 --> 17:13.160
Right now!
Marshall!

17:13.161 --> 17:16.563
I'm sorry, but he's
adorable. Listen.

17:16.564 --> 17:17.897
I don't want to be with you.

17:17.898 --> 17:19.733
Right now.
Hang in there, Scoots!

17:19.733 --> 17:21.468
I'm not going to live forever.

17:22.537 --> 17:24.938
Last night I was with
this pharma girl who was

17:24.939 --> 17:26.439
so hot, you should call a doctor

17:26.440 --> 17:29.242
if you don't have an erection
for more than four hours.

17:29.243 --> 17:31.511
Am I right, people?

17:31.512 --> 17:32.546
Yeah, there's no people-

17:32.547 --> 17:34.848
just the girl
you most recently dated.

17:34.849 --> 17:36.116
(clicks tongue)

17:36.117 --> 17:37.584
Hey, Barney.

17:37.585 --> 17:39.920
I want you to meet
the newest pharma girl.

17:39.921 --> 17:40.987
Oh.

17:40.988 --> 17:41.988
Gladys Reynolds.

17:41.989 --> 17:43.423
Nice to make
your acquaintance.

17:43.424 --> 17:47.194
I represent statins and other
cholesterol-lowering drugs.

17:47.195 --> 17:49.296
Come on, girl.
Let's go get our drink on.

17:51.132 --> 17:53.433
It's over.

17:53.434 --> 17:54.634
What's over?

17:54.635 --> 17:58.905
Pharma girls are no longer
exclusively hot chicks.

17:58.906 --> 18:01.341
It's the en.
You're being

18:01.342 --> 18:02.375
a little dramatic.

18:02.376 --> 18:03.743
Am I?

18:03.744 --> 18:05.478
It starts out with a Gladys.

18:05.479 --> 18:07.747
Next thing you know,
a few not-so-fabulous

18:07.748 --> 18:09.316
gay guys enter the ranks.

18:09.317 --> 18:10.684
And before
you know it,

18:10.685 --> 18:12.986
pharma girls look like the crew

18:12.987 --> 18:16.089
on a Southwest flight
from Albuquerque to Little Rock.

18:17.225 --> 18:19.860
It's over!

18:19.861 --> 18:22.929
<i>So that night, I went
straight to Henrietta's-</i>

18:22.930 --> 18:24.931
<i>all set to let her
off the hook.</i>

18:33.808 --> 18:34.975
This is Jack.

18:34.976 --> 18:36.710
He's the best man
at the wedding.

18:40.681 --> 18:42.883
I'm done.

18:46.254 --> 18:48.321
Yes!

18:48.322 --> 18:50.523
The answer is yes!

18:51.759 --> 18:53.293
No.

18:53.294 --> 18:55.829
Oh, it gets worse.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.364
It's perfect!

18:57.365 --> 19:00.333
Mom, Dad!
Ted proposed!

19:00.334 --> 19:02.836
Oh, my God!
I knew this day would come!

19:02.837 --> 19:03.870
(stammering)

19:03.871 --> 19:06.072
Son!
Yeah, well, there's been a...

19:06.073 --> 19:08.975
No. What did you do?

19:08.976 --> 19:12.846
I seriously considered
just marrying her

19:12.847 --> 19:14.347
out of sheer awkwardness.

19:15.016 --> 19:16.583
But I did what I had to do.

19:16.584 --> 19:20.220
I did what anyone keeping
someone on the hook should do.

19:20.221 --> 19:21.855
I broke her heart.

19:21.856 --> 19:24.257
Henrietta, I'm sorry
if this is blunt,

19:24.258 --> 19:26.026
but I think
I owe you this.

19:27.295 --> 19:30.030
I don't want to be with you.

19:30.031 --> 19:32.532
Right now?

19:32.533 --> 19:34.401
Ever.

19:36.070 --> 19:38.838
But we're still
getting married, right?

19:38.839 --> 19:42.475
It was brutal.

19:42.476 --> 19:43.877
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.

19:43.878 --> 19:45.845
Honesty is tough,
but in the end,

19:45.846 --> 19:48.214
it is the far kinder
alternative.

19:48.215 --> 19:50.050
Yeah.

19:50.051 --> 19:52.118
Hey, sweetie.

19:53.921 --> 19:55.155
Hey, Mike.

19:55.156 --> 19:57.424
I have to tell
you something.

19:58.225 --> 20:00.226
Wait. Did you finish
my delicates?

20:00.227 --> 20:02.562
Got one more load.
Ah, it can wait.

20:06.434 --> 20:07.734
I...

20:13.454 --> 20:15.088
Hey.
Hey, how's it going?

20:15.089 --> 20:17.490
Still in mourning over the end
of the pharma girl era?

20:17.491 --> 20:20.059
No. I realized
that their reign

20:20.060 --> 20:22.929
had to end to make room for some
new hot girl profession.

20:24.064 --> 20:27.667
Maybe it'll be intergalactic
communications officer

20:27.668 --> 20:30.003
on a rocket ship
to some distant solar system

20:30.004 --> 20:31.804
we can't possibly imagine.

20:31.805 --> 20:34.407
Maybe it'll be... meter maids.

20:34.408 --> 20:35.742
We just don't know.

20:36.744 --> 20:38.978
But one thing is sure.

20:38.979 --> 20:43.816
The future glows
like a giant sun

20:43.817 --> 20:48.488
shooting amber rays of light
into our hearts and minds.

20:49.657 --> 20:52.525
Wow, uh,
what changed your mind?

20:52.526 --> 20:55.561
The realization that hope
springs eternal, Robin.

20:56.563 --> 20:58.731
That and this little
bottle of purple pills

20:58.732 --> 21:00.700
I found in my couch cushion.

21:00.701 --> 21:03.703
Don't know what they are,
but they are amazing!
