WEBVTT

00:02.310 --> 00:06.137
NO RISK, NO REWARD--
THIS WEEK, THE SUMMER'S MOTTO

00:06.172 --> 00:08.586
HAS NEVER BEEN MORE TRUE.

00:08.620 --> 00:12.896
WELCOME TO LIVE EVICTION NIGHT
ON "BIG BROTHER"!

00:12.931 --> 00:18.206
PREVIOUSLY ON
"BIG BROTHER": SARAH BEASTED HER

00:18.241 --> 00:19.482
WAY TO POWER.

00:19.517 --> 00:21.206
CONGRATULATIONS,
SARAH BETH.

00:21.241 --> 00:23.413
YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

00:23.448 --> 00:24.551
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:24.586 --> 00:27.655
SO LOOKING TO
PROTECT HIS SECRET COOKOUT

00:27.689 --> 00:31.068
ALLIANCE, HER BESTIE KYLAND
PUSHED HER TO TARGET DEREK X.

00:31.103 --> 00:36.827
IN TERMS OF HIS THREAT LEVEL
TO YOU AND I, HE'S THE HIGHEST,

00:36.862 --> 00:38.034
MOST IMMINENT.

00:38.068 --> 00:43.034
IDEALLY, I CAN CONVINCE SARAH
BETH TO TAKE OUT THE BIGGEST

00:43.068 --> 00:44.275
THREAT TO THE COOKOUT, DEREK X.

00:44.310 --> 00:48.413
AND SARAH BETH
PUT UP TWO PAWNS WITH HER SIGHTS

00:48.448 --> 00:50.103
SET ON A BACKDOOR.

00:50.137 --> 00:55.103
I NOMINATED DEREK F. AND
CLAIRE, BUT I'M REALLY LOOKING

00:55.137 --> 00:56.379
AT DEREK X.

00:56.413 --> 00:59.931
THE HIGH ROLLERS
ROOM REOPENED, AND DX DECLINED A

00:59.965 --> 01:01.068
CHANCE TO COMPETE FOR SAFETY.

01:01.103 --> 01:04.137
I AM NOT PLAYING THE
ROULETTE.

01:04.172 --> 01:05.689
I'M GOING TO KEEP SAVING AND
WE'RE GOING FOR THAT COIN OF

01:05.724 --> 01:06.758
SKINNY.

01:06.793 --> 01:10.206
BUT ALYSSA
SEIZED THE MOMENT AND WON

01:10.241 --> 01:10.931
CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE.

01:10.965 --> 01:11.551
ALYSSA!

01:11.586 --> 01:14.034
YOU ARE SAFE FOR THE WEEK.

01:14.068 --> 01:16.862
WITH THE
SWIMWEAR DESIGNER SAVING DEREK

01:16.896 --> 01:17.827
F....

01:17.862 --> 01:18.758
WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE
OFF THE BLOCK?

01:18.793 --> 01:21.655
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE DEREK
OFF THE BLOCK.

01:21.689 --> 01:22.931
THANK YOU.

01:22.965 --> 01:26.758
...A SPIN OF THE
WHEEL PUT ANOTHER COOKOUT MEMBER

01:26.793 --> 01:28.551
ON THE HOT SEAT.

01:28.586 --> 01:31.379
XAVIER, YOU ARE NOW NOMINATED
FOR EVICTION.

01:31.413 --> 01:32.793
PLEASE TAKE A SEAT.

01:32.827 --> 01:36.724
AFTER DX HAD A
CHAT WITH S.B. ABOUT HER PLANS.

01:36.758 --> 01:40.034
DO YOU KNOW IF YOU WOULD WANT
TO USE THE VETO?

01:40.068 --> 01:42.724
I'M JUST HOPING I CAN WIN
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT

01:42.758 --> 01:46.034
TO DO, BUT I WOULD RATHER-- I
HAVE MY OPTIONS, YOU KNOW,.

01:46.068 --> 01:47.137
YEAH, YEAH.

01:47.172 --> 01:51.758
HE FINALLY
REALIZED HE WAS IN TROUBLE.

01:51.793 --> 01:53.655
THIS GIRL DOESN'T TELL ME
ANYTHING.

01:53.689 --> 01:56.482
I DON'T TRUST HER AT ALL RIGHT
NOW.

01:56.517 --> 02:00.000
I FEEL LIKE THE BIGGEST IDIOT ON
THE PLANET BECAUSE I COULD HAVE

02:00.034 --> 02:01.620
PLAYED THE STUPID WHEEL.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.551
NOW I COULD GET BACKDOORED.

02:03.586 --> 02:06.586
AND HIS WORST
NIGHTMARE CAME TRUE WHEN HE

02:06.620 --> 02:08.103
WASN'T PICKED TO PLAY VETO.

02:08.137 --> 02:10.034
MY NAME DIDN'T GET DRAWN AND
NOW I CAN'T PLAY TO SECURE MY

02:10.068 --> 02:11.172
OWN SAFETY.

02:11.206 --> 02:13.275
AT THE VETO
COMPETITION, "X" CLAIMED THE

02:13.310 --> 02:14.206
POWER...

02:14.241 --> 02:16.206
XAVIER HAS WON THE GOLDEN
POWER OF VETO.

02:16.241 --> 02:18.379
...AND THREE
PUNISHMENTS.

02:18.413 --> 02:19.275
B.B. BANKRUPTCY.

02:19.310 --> 02:22.310
OH, MY GOSH.

02:22.344 --> 02:26.137
STRATEGY SHUTDOWN, AND HE'LL
BECOME THE THIRD NOMINEE AT THE

02:26.172 --> 02:27.241
NEXT AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITY.

02:27.275 --> 02:29.482
AFTER XAVIER
SAVED HIMSELF AT THE VETO

02:29.517 --> 02:30.586
MEETING...

02:30.620 --> 02:34.034
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE
POWER OF VETO ON MYSELF.

02:34.068 --> 02:37.241
...S.B. STUCK TO
HER BACKDOOR PLAN.

02:37.275 --> 02:40.965
DEREK X., PLEASE TAKE A SEAT.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.275
TONIGHT, WITH
THE COOKOUT DIVIDED ON WHO

02:44.310 --> 02:51.379
SHOULD BE THE TARGET, WILL IT BE
BABY "D" OR CLAIRE SENT TO JURY?

02:51.413 --> 02:53.965
AND WHO WILL BE THE NEXT TO
CAPTURE THE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD?

02:54.000 --> 03:00.965
FIEND OUT LIVE RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

03:01.000 --> 03:04.758
PLACE YOUR BETS, PLACE YOUR
BETS.

03:04.793 --> 03:05.965
ME.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.689
DX!

03:10.724 --> 03:11.482
GOOD EVENING.

03:11.517 --> 03:13.586
I'M JULIE CHEN MOONVES.

03:13.620 --> 03:16.724
WELCOME TO "BIG BROTHER."

03:16.758 --> 03:19.413
IT'S DAY 51 INSIDE THE "BIG
BROTHER" HOUSE, AND HISTORY

03:19.448 --> 03:21.517
SEEMS POISED TO REPEAT ITSELF.

03:21.551 --> 03:25.206
FOR THE SECOND WEEK IN A ROW,
CHOOSING NOT TO GAMBLE IN THE

03:25.241 --> 03:29.172
HIGH ROLLERS ROOM HAS PUT A
HOUSEGUEST IN DANGER.

03:29.206 --> 03:33.517
AS A RESULT, THE ONCE-CONFIDENT
DEREK X. NOW FINDS HIMSELF ON

03:33.551 --> 03:37.275
THE CHOPPING BLOCK NEXT TO
CLAIRE, ONE OF HIS CLOSEST

03:37.310 --> 03:40.586
ALLIES, AS PART OF SARAH BETH'S
BACKDOOR PLAN.

03:40.620 --> 03:44.172
SO, WHO WILL ULTIMATELY BE
WALKING UP ON THE THE FRONT

03:44.206 --> 03:44.827
DOOR?

03:44.862 --> 03:46.931
WE'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.

03:46.965 --> 03:51.000
BUT FIRST, THE COOKOUT MAY BE
RUNNING THE GAME, BUT WHO STAYS

03:51.034 --> 03:55.241
AND WHO GOES TONIGHT WILL
DETERMINE WHO'S REALLY RUNNING

03:55.275 --> 03:56.896
THE COOKOUT.

03:56.931 --> 04:03.448
THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

04:03.482 --> 04:06.862
IT'S FUNNY, DEREK X. THOUGHT

04:06.896 --> 04:10.137
THAT BY TAKE OUT CHRISTIAN, HE
WOULD BE TAKING OUT THE BIGGEST

04:10.172 --> 04:11.482
COMPETITOR IN THIS GAME.

04:11.517 --> 04:15.448
WHAT HE DOESN'T REALIZE IS THE
BIGGEST COMPETITOR IS STILL IN

04:15.482 --> 04:18.965
THIS HOUSE, AND IT'S THE MAIN
PERSON WHO TARGETED HIM SINCE

04:19.000 --> 04:21.655
CHRISTIAN WENT OUT THE DOOR.

04:21.689 --> 04:24.862
SEE YOU LATER, BABY D.

04:24.896 --> 04:30.275
RIGHT NOW, IT'S ME VERSUS
DEREK X., AND AS MUCH AS I ADORE

04:30.310 --> 04:33.413
HIM, HE DEFINITELY IS MY BEST
CHANCE AT STAYING.

04:33.448 --> 04:36.551
HE'S SUCH A HUGE PHYSICAL
THREAT, I DEFINITELY BELIEVE

04:36.586 --> 04:43.103
THAT AT THIS MOMENT, THE HOUSE
DOES WANT DEREK X. OUT.

04:43.137 --> 04:45.034
DEREK X. IS ON THE BLOCK.

04:45.068 --> 04:47.413
I CAN LET OUT A SIGH OF RELIEF.

04:47.448 --> 04:51.413
I FEEL CONFIDENT I HAVE THE
VOTES, AND DEREK X. SHOULD BE

04:51.448 --> 04:51.965
PACKING HIS BAGS.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.482
CLAIRE IS MY GIRL.

04:53.517 --> 04:57.275
BUT I REALLY HAVE TO THINK
WHAT'S BEST FOR MY GAME.

04:57.310 --> 04:59.413
DEREK X. IS A REALLY CLOSE ALLY
OF MINE.

04:59.448 --> 05:04.655
HE'S LIKE A TOTAL COMP BEAST,
AND HE WOULD NEVER COME FOR ME,

05:04.689 --> 05:08.379
SO HE PROBABLY WOULD BE ABLE TO
GET ME FURTHER IN THIS GAME.

05:08.413 --> 05:10.482
HAD TO USE IT, HUH.

05:10.517 --> 05:11.241
SORRY, BUDDY.

05:11.275 --> 05:12.793
HAD TO USE IT.

05:12.827 --> 05:15.862
S.B. BACKDOORS ME AND I'M A
LITTLE PISSED.

05:15.896 --> 05:18.275
I LOST TO HER BY A FRACTION OF A
SECOND IN THE H.O.H. AND I

05:18.310 --> 05:19.758
COULDN'T EVEN PLAY IN THE VETO.

05:19.793 --> 05:22.896
THE WORST PART IS I'M SITTING
NEXT TO ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS

05:22.931 --> 05:24.344
IN THIS HOUSE, CLAIRE, ON THE
BLOCK.

05:24.379 --> 05:27.413
BUT I HAVE NOT GIVEN UP YET THAT
I'M DEFINITELY LEAVING THIS

05:27.448 --> 05:31.137
WEEK.

05:31.172 --> 05:32.413
LET'S GO TALK.

05:32.448 --> 05:33.344
ALL RIGHT.

05:33.379 --> 05:35.137
SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO THIS
WEEK?

05:35.172 --> 05:41.620
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD SEND
CLAIRE HOME THIS WEEK AND KEEP

05:41.655 --> 05:42.344
DX?

05:42.379 --> 05:44.758
DX WILL KEEP ALL OF US SAFE.

05:44.793 --> 05:54.793
I WAS THINKING HE WOULD TAKE
OUT ALYSSA AND S.B.

06:13.034 --> 06:19.206
IT'S LITERALLY BEING HANDED
TO US ON A SILVER PLATTER.

06:19.241 --> 06:20.413
WHY?

06:20.448 --> 06:23.448
WHY WOULD WE KEEP THE STRONGEST
COMPETITOR OUTSIDE OF THE

06:23.482 --> 06:24.482
COOKOUT AROUND?

06:24.517 --> 06:34.068
NOW I'VE GOT TO GO TO WORK ON
TIFFANY AND AZAH.

06:34.103 --> 06:35.310
SO...

06:35.344 --> 06:41.655
IF THIS WERE MY PERSONAL
- GAME, BABY D.
- WOULD STAY, BECAUSE

06:41.689 --> 06:57.551
THE TARGET HE IS DEAD SET ON
MAKING SURE TO GET OUT IS S.B.

06:57.586 --> 06:59.413
>
> OKAY, I HEAR YOU.

07:06.103 --> 07:09.620
I THINK AZAH IS BACK ON BOARD
WITH VOTING OUT DEREK X.

07:09.655 --> 07:13.241
SOMETHING TELLS ME TIFFANY IS
NOT GOING TO BE AS EASY TO

07:13.275 --> 07:19.137
PERSUADE AS AZAH.

07:19.172 --> 07:19.448
HONESTLY.

07:19.482 --> 07:23.448
YES?

07:23.482 --> 07:28.172
IF I WASN'T AFRAID OF Y'ALL
BEING MAD AT ME.

07:28.206 --> 07:28.965
I KNOW.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE A
QUESTION.

07:31.034 --> 07:33.586
I KNOW.

07:33.620 --> 07:37.310
SHE'S LIKE, "I KEEP FINDING
MYSELF TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE

07:37.344 --> 07:40.344
IN THE SIX AND HAVING TO
CONVINCE THEM AS TO WHY THIS

07:40.379 --> 07:43.172
WEEK IS THE IDEAL WEEK."

07:43.206 --> 07:45.724
I THINK THAT FEELS UNFAIR TO
HER.

07:45.758 --> 07:49.275
OKAY, BUT YOU CAN WALK AROUND
AND SAY THAT THIS IS MY PERSON,

07:49.310 --> 07:51.862
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN OTHER
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE CONNECTIONS

07:51.896 --> 07:52.793
WITH THESE PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE.

07:52.827 --> 07:54.137
OF COURSE, I AGREE.

07:54.172 --> 07:55.413
NOBODY IS DISAGREEING WITH YOU.

07:55.448 --> 07:57.965
SO WHAT WAS YOUR POINT?

07:58.000 --> 08:01.206
OF COURSE I HAVE TALKED TO
HANNAH ABOUT THIS, AND I KNOW

08:01.241 --> 08:03.724
THAT THEY WANT DEREK X. TO
LEAVE.

08:03.758 --> 08:09.655
HOWEVER, I'M NOT GOING TO LET
KYLAND GUILTY TRIP ME ABOUT HOW

08:09.689 --> 08:10.931
I FEEL REGARDING DEREK X.

08:10.965 --> 08:12.586
STAYING IN THIS HOUSE.

08:12.620 --> 08:13.827
I AM SO ANNOYED RIGHT NOW.

08:13.862 --> 08:17.551
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE HERE
THINKING WE WANT YOU TO AGREE.

08:17.586 --> 08:21.000
IF THERE'S A CASE TO BE MADE,
LET'S TALK OUT THE CASE.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.241
LET'S FIGURE IT OUT.

08:22.275 --> 08:27.137
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I
THINK OR FEEL ABOUT IT IF IT IS

08:27.172 --> 08:31.379
A UNANIMOUS DECISION OUTSIDE OF
MYSELF.

08:31.413 --> 08:47.448
OKAY.

08:48.206 --> 08:50.620
THERE ARE PROS AND CONS TO
EACH.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.827
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT.

08:53.862 --> 08:58.586
D"X" LEAVING THIS WEEK, I
UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU GUYS ARE

08:58.620 --> 08:59.827
COMING FROM WITH THAT.

08:59.862 --> 09:03.758
I ALSO FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE
HAD NO IDEA THAT S.B. WOULD BE

09:03.793 --> 09:06.862
THE ONE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE HIM
OUT.

09:06.896 --> 09:11.793
SO HE'S NOT UNTOUCHABLE, BUT
WHATEVER Y'ALL WANT TO DO, I'M

09:11.827 --> 09:13.000
FINE WITH THAT.

09:13.034 --> 09:16.551
TIFFANY DOES SEEM A LITTLE
UPSET, BUT SHE DOES SEEM ON

09:16.586 --> 09:18.655
BOARD WITH GETTING DEREK X. OUT
AT THIS POINT.

09:18.689 --> 09:21.103
SO I FEEL LIKE MY JOB IS DONE.

09:21.137 --> 09:21.620
PLAY THE GAME.

09:21.655 --> 09:26.275
I PLAY THE GAME.

09:26.310 --> 09:29.965
I'M TELLING XAVIER AND KYLAND
WHATEVER THEY NEED TO HEAR SO

09:30.000 --> 09:32.103
THIS CONVERSATION CAN BE DONE.

09:32.137 --> 09:37.068
THE CONVERSATION IS OVER, BUT
THE GAME IS STILL ON.

09:37.103 --> 09:39.413
I WAS READY TO FLIP IT FOR
CHRISTIAN.

09:39.448 --> 09:43.137
I'M READY TO FLIP IT FOR DX, AND
THIS TIME, I MIGHT JUST GET WHAT

09:43.172 --> 09:43.793
I WANT.

09:43.827 --> 09:54.137
I CAME HERE TO PLAY A GAME.

09:54.172 --> 09:57.034
I KNOW THEY WANT ME OUT OF HERE
FIRST.

09:57.068 --> 09:59.517
AH...

09:59.551 --> 10:01.551
WHO IS "THEY" YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT?

10:01.586 --> 10:06.310
THE SIX.

10:07.344 --> 10:12.206
7.

10:12.241 --> 10:18.689
I WAS REALLY THINKING, LIKE,
IF THE LAST THREE COULD BE ME,

10:18.724 --> 10:23.517
YOU, AND CHADDHA.

10:23.551 --> 10:27.241
I LIKE THE GUYS, BUT THEY WOULD
BEAT US.

10:27.275 --> 10:30.103
IF ANY ONE OF THEM GETS TO
THREE, WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

10:30.137 --> 10:31.379
I AGREE.

10:31.413 --> 10:34.517
I THINK IF IT'S ME, YOU, AND
CHADDHA, THAT'S A FAIR FIGHT.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.103
I AGREE.

10:36.137 --> 10:38.551
THEY HAVE TOO MUCH ON THEIR
RESUME.

10:38.586 --> 10:41.310
AND THEY THINK THAT THEY'RE
CARRYING US.

10:41.344 --> 10:46.620
THESE GUYS WANT TO TAKE CREDIT
FOR RUNNING EVERYTHING.

10:46.655 --> 10:51.241
HOWEVER, CAN THEY FORGET THAT
THE ONE WHO CAME UP WITH THE

10:51.275 --> 10:52.034
MASTER PLAN?

10:52.068 --> 10:53.413
AND, CLEARLY, IT'S WORKING.

10:53.448 --> 10:57.103
NOW IT'S TIME TO START PLANNING
ON HOW THE READIES CAN TAKE THE

10:57.137 --> 10:58.310
WHEEL.

10:58.344 --> 10:59.965
AND I BELIEVE THAT STARTS BY
KEEPING DEREK X. IN THE HOUSE

11:00.000 --> 11:00.758
THIS WEEK.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.310
WE HAVE HALF THE SEASON TO
GO.

11:02.344 --> 11:14.689
WE'VE GOT A LOT MORE TO BE ABLE
TO SHOW OURSELVES.

11:14.724 --> 11:17.689
UP NEXT, XAVIER GETS
LOCKED AWAY.

11:17.724 --> 11:19.517
COULD A DOOR OPEN FOR DEREK X.

11:19.551 --> 11:20.413
TO STAY?

11:20.448 --> 11:22.689
THE LIVE VOTE AND EVICTION IS
COMING UP.

11:22.724 --> 11:26.137
PLUS, IT'S TIME TO CROWN A NEW
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

11:26.172 --> 11:29.034
THAT COMPETITION PLAYS OUT LIVE
TONIGHT.

11:29.068 --> 11:29.931
STAY WITH US.

11:45.344 --> 11:53.413
WITH TIFFANY BEHIND HIM, DEREK
X. LOOKS TO CHANGE HIS FATE.

11:53.448 --> 11:55.137
WHY ARE YOU WALKING SO FAST?

11:55.172 --> 11:56.000
I DON'T KNOW.

11:56.034 --> 12:01.758
HANI IS JUST OUT HER HERE
CONNIVING.

12:01.793 --> 12:06.827
HEY, GUYS, CAN I GET EVERYONE
TO GATHER IN THE LIVING ROOM?

12:06.862 --> 12:10.793
XAVIER, ONE OF THE PUNISHMENTS

12:10.827 --> 12:16.103
YOU TOOK IN THE VETO COMPETITION
WAS THE STRATEGY SHUTDOWN.

12:16.137 --> 12:17.620
AND IT BEGINS NOW.

12:17.655 --> 12:20.793
YOU WILL BE LOCKED IN THE
HAVE-NOT ROOM FOR THE NEXT 24

12:20.827 --> 12:24.068
HOURS AND WON'T BE RELEASED
UNTIL JULY CALLS YOU DOWN TO

12:24.103 --> 12:26.310
CAST YOUR LIVE EVICTION VOTE.

12:26.344 --> 12:29.172
GRAB SOME FOOD AND WATER AND
HEAD UP TO THE ROOM NOW.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.413
GOT IT.

12:30.448 --> 12:35.379
FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS, I WILL BE
FORCED TO STAY IN SOLITARY

12:35.413 --> 12:35.965
CONFINEMENT.

12:36.000 --> 12:36.793
BIEB, EVERYONE.

12:36.827 --> 12:37.827
I'LL MISS YOU.

12:37.862 --> 12:38.275
REMEMBER ME.

12:38.310 --> 12:39.827
REMEMBER US!

12:39.862 --> 12:41.413
REMEMBER ME.

12:41.448 --> 12:42.896
IN THE HAVE-NOT ROOM BY MYSELF.

12:42.931 --> 12:43.689
BYE, I LOVE YOU.

12:43.724 --> 12:45.862
WE LOVE YOU, "X"!

12:45.896 --> 12:52.241
I WILL HAVE A LUXURIOUS STAY
IN THE HAVE-NOT VILLA.

12:52.275 --> 12:52.862
HOME, SWEET HOME.

12:52.896 --> 12:55.137
I GUESS?

12:55.172 --> 13:01.620
I WILL HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF
FOOD, A TOILET, AND WATER.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.517
MY TOILET IS...

13:04.551 --> 13:08.517
A BUCKET.

13:08.551 --> 13:15.068
B.B. GODS, PLEASE LET THE
COOKOUT KEEP IT TOGETHER FOR ONE

13:15.103 --> 13:15.931
VOTE.

13:15.965 --> 13:23.655
WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO THAT REAL
QUICK.

13:23.689 --> 13:24.379
THIS AIN'T WORKING.

13:24.413 --> 13:28.482
LOOK AT THAT.

13:52.344 --> 13:55.517
I NEED FOUR VOTES TO STAY
THIS WEEK, AND RIGHT NOW I'M

13:55.551 --> 13:58.034
COUNTING ON TIFFANY, HANNAH, AND
KYLAND.

13:58.068 --> 14:01.172
I JUST NEED ONE MORE VOTE TO
STAY THIS WEEK, AND I THINK I

14:01.206 --> 14:11.206
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET IT FROM
AZAH.

14:42.103 --> 14:46.275
IF THE GUYS ARE RUNNING THE
HOUSE, WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE,

14:46.310 --> 14:47.827
BUT YOU CAN BE THE ONE TO HELP
US.

14:47.862 --> 14:54.379
AND IT COULD BE ME, YOU,
CHADDHA.

14:54.413 --> 14:57.034
AZAH.

14:57.068 --> 15:02.448
AT THE END.

15:02.482 --> 15:06.172
I THINK YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.034
I DO HAVE A PITCH.

15:08.068 --> 15:16.172
I THINK RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE VIEW
THE POWER BALANCE AS COUNTY,

15:16.206 --> 15:22.034
S.B., AND ALYSSA.

15:22.068 --> 15:28.068
I KNOW THAT IF I STAY IN THIS
GAME, I'M NOT LONG FOR THE GAME.

15:28.103 --> 15:31.862
WHAT I WANT BEFORE I GO IS TO
LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR

15:31.896 --> 15:35.689
EVERYONE ELSE.

15:35.724 --> 15:39.206
LET'S SAY I AM ABLE TO TAKE OUT
TWO.

15:39.241 --> 15:42.344
AND THEN THEY TAKE ME OUT.

15:42.379 --> 15:51.413
I THINK THIS GAME LOOKS A LOT
BETTER FOR THE PEOPLE REMAINING.

15:51.448 --> 15:56.448
I'M GOING TO THINK VERY LONG
AND HARD ON THIS, EXTREMELY,

15:56.482 --> 15:58.206
EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY CONVINCING.

15:58.241 --> 16:03.517
LIKE, FOR ME, I'VE ACCEPTED I
WON'T GO FAR IN THE SEASON.

16:03.551 --> 16:06.000
AND I'M PERFECTLY OKAY WITH
THAT.

16:06.034 --> 16:07.034
BUT I CARE ABOUT YOU.

16:07.068 --> 16:10.000
I CARE ABOUT TIF.

16:10.034 --> 16:16.137
I CARE ABOUT HANNAH.

16:16.172 --> 16:19.310
COME HERE.

16:19.344 --> 16:19.862
DEPRESSION KITTY.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.689
NO, NO.

16:21.724 --> 16:26.241
BABY "D" STAYING IN THE HOUSE
AND WILLING TO BE THAT SHIELD

16:26.275 --> 16:28.862
COULD BE A GAME CHANGER.

16:28.896 --> 16:33.620
ONE, IT KEEPS A LARGE TARGET IN
THE HOUSE THAT ALYSSA AND S.B.

16:33.655 --> 16:36.413
CAN CONTINUE TO GO AFTER.

16:36.448 --> 16:40.137
IT'S ALSO AN ALLY THAT I
HONESTLY HAVE COME TO REALLY

16:40.172 --> 16:41.758
VALUE AND LOVE IN THE HOUSE.

16:41.793 --> 16:46.137
I REALLY NEED TO FIGURE OUT IF
THIS IS THE BEST GAME PLAY HERE.

16:46.172 --> 16:57.931
I LOVE YOU.

16:57.965 --> 17:01.724
OH, MY GOD!

17:01.758 --> 17:04.517
I FELT SO CERTAIN UNTIL, LIKE,
30 MINUTES AGO.

17:04.551 --> 17:08.517
I WAS LIKE, BOOM, HE NEEDS TO
GO.

17:08.551 --> 17:12.448
HE BROUGHT UP SOME REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY GOOD POINTS.

17:12.482 --> 17:15.275
GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

17:15.310 --> 17:21.620
UP NEXT, XAVIER IS
RELEASED FROM HIS 24-HOUR

17:21.655 --> 17:25.448
STRATEGY SHUTDOWN PUNISHMENT,
JUST IN TIME TO CAST HIS VOTE TO

17:25.482 --> 17:26.068
EVICT.

BROTHER."

17:45.965 --> 17:47.827
CLAIRE OR DEREK X.?

17:47.862 --> 17:50.000
WHO WILL BECOME THE NEXT MEMBER
OF THE JURY?

17:50.034 --> 17:54.275
LET'S HEAD TO THE LIVING ROOM
AND TALK WITH THE TWO NOMINEES.

17:54.310 --> 17:56.275
HELLO, HOUSEGUESTS.

17:56.310 --> 17:59.724
HELLO, HELLO.

17:59.758 --> 18:01.620
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

18:01.655 --> 18:02.137
YES!

18:02.172 --> 18:03.310
OH, GOOD.

18:03.344 --> 18:05.655
BECAUSE I COULD NOT HEAR YOU.

18:05.689 --> 18:06.137
LIVE TELEVISION.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.931
DON'T YOU LOVE IT?

18:07.965 --> 18:12.103
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, IT'S TIME
FOR THE LIVE VOTE AND EVICTION.

18:12.137 --> 18:13.034
CLAIRE, DEREK X.

18:13.068 --> 18:19.482
DEREK X., MAY I CALL YOU BABY
"D."

18:19.517 --> 18:21.482
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.103
YES.

18:22.137 --> 18:26.172
OKAY, THANK YOU.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.793
CLAIRE, BABY "D," IN JUST
MOMENTS YOUR HOUSEMATES WILL

18:27.827 --> 18:29.482
CAST THEIR VOTES TO EVICT LIVE.

18:29.517 --> 18:31.896
BUT BEFORE THEY DO, YOU EACH
HAVE A FINAL CHANCE TO SWAY

18:31.931 --> 18:34.310
THEIR VOTES WITH ONE BRIEF
STATEMENT.

18:34.344 --> 18:37.172
CLAIRE, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

18:37.206 --> 18:43.103
MOM, DAD, TAILOR, ADDIE, AT
LEAST ONE OF US CAN REMEMBER

18:43.137 --> 18:43.620
YOUR NAME.

18:43.655 --> 18:45.827
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

18:45.862 --> 18:47.068
TEAM "E" FOREVER.

18:47.103 --> 18:48.793
HOUSEGUESTS THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A
PLEASURE SO FAR.

18:48.827 --> 18:52.793
AND, YOU KNOW, BRITINI REALLY
SAID IT BEST-- THIS IS AN

18:52.827 --> 18:56.482
INDIVIDUAL GAME, AND SO IF YOU
THINK THAT IN THIS GAME I CAN BE

18:56.517 --> 19:01.137
AN ASSET TO YOU, THEN PLEASE
KEEP-- VOTE TO KEEP ME HERE.

19:01.172 --> 19:05.172
YOU KNOW, I HAVE NEVER BEEN THE
VETO QUEEN OR KING.

19:05.206 --> 19:08.931
AND I HAVEN'T HAD THAT MANY
WINS, BUT I WOULD LOVE TO KEEP

19:08.965 --> 19:13.103
MY LIFE IN THIS GAME A LITTLE
BIT LONGER.

19:13.137 --> 19:14.448
THANK YOU, ALL, SO MUCH.

19:14.482 --> 19:16.034
THANK YOU, CLAIRE.

19:16.068 --> 19:21.241

19:21.275 --> 19:25.724
SHOUTOUT TO ALL MY FRIEND AND
FAMILY, EVERYBODY BACK HOME.

19:25.758 --> 19:29.275
FOLLOW "EAT REMY" ON INSTAGRAM.

19:29.310 --> 19:32.344
HOUSEGUESTS, IN "BIG BROTHER" I
BELIEVE THERE ARE INFLECTION

19:32.379 --> 19:33.724
POINTS THAT CHANGE THE COURSE OF
THE GAME.

19:33.758 --> 19:37.172
I SAW THE FIRST INFLECTION POINT
IN TEAM FIVE WHEN THERE WAS A

19:37.206 --> 19:40.827
STRONG TEAM OF FOUR MOVING INTO
JOURNEY AND I MADE A MOVE TO

19:40.862 --> 19:42.206
TAKE OUT ONE OF THEM.

19:42.241 --> 19:45.551
THAT WAS BAD FOR MY PERSONAL
GAME BUT I THOUGHT IT CREATED A

19:45.586 --> 19:46.275
MORE FAIR HOUSE.

19:46.310 --> 19:51.724
THIS WEEK I SEE A SECOND POINT.

19:51.758 --> 19:55.379
IF I STAY, I CAN PROMISE I WILL
TAKE THIS PERSON OUT, AND I WILL

19:55.413 --> 19:56.655
BE YOUR BIGGEST SHIELD.

19:56.689 --> 19:59.241
I KNOW THAT BY SAYING THIS, IF
YOU DO KEEP ME, I'M NOT LONG FOR

19:59.275 --> 20:00.517
THE GAME.

20:00.551 --> 20:03.448
BUT RIGHT NOW, I JUST WANT TO
PLAY THIS GAME SO I CAN GIVE THE

20:03.482 --> 20:08.241

SHOT AS POSSIBLE AT WINNING IT.

25:35.344 --> 25:37.758

25:52.827 --> 25:54.241
I'LL MISS HAMMOCK TIME.

25:54.275 --> 25:59.655
I KNOW.

25:59.689 --> 26:02.827
S.B., NO HARD FEELINGS.

26:02.862 --> 26:13.206

26:13.241 --> 26:14.068
OH, GOSH, OKAY.

26:14.103 --> 26:15.793
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I DON'T CRY

26:15.827 --> 26:16.655
I LOVE YOU, KIDDIE.

26:16.689 --> 26:17.793
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

26:17.827 --> 26:22.379
YOU ARE AMAZING.

26:22.413 --> 26:24.379
OH, IS THIS FOR ME?

26:24.413 --> 26:24.896
<i>[ LAUGHTER ].</i>

26:24.931 --> 26:26.896
GIVE ME A BREAK.

I LOVE YOU.

26:28.862 --> 26:29.896
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

26:29.931 --> 26:32.551
YOU HAVE THE BEST PERSONALITY IN
THIS HOUSE, KIDDO.

26:32.586 --> 26:34.000
YOU'RE LEAVING ME HERE WITH
THESE PEOPLE.

26:34.034 --> 26:36.206
SHE'S GOING TO MAKE ME CRY.

26:36.241 --> 26:40.344
LISTEN, I LOVE YOU, DERRICK.

26:40.379 --> 26:42.000
I LOVE YOU, "D."

26:42.034 --> 26:46.482
I'M GOING TO TAKE MY NAME BACK

YOU'RE AMAZING.

26:48.586 --> 26:50.586
I DID, DID I.

26:50.620 --> 26:54.344
YOU'RE AMAZING.

26:54.379 --> 26:58.000
YOU ARE THE BEST NUMBER ONE I
COULD HAVE.

26:58.034 --> 26:58.758
THANK YOU!

26:58.793 --> 27:00.862
I'M ACTUALLY THE WORST,
BUT...

27:00.896 --> 27:03.827
LOVE YOU!

27:03.862 --> 27:06.310
BYE, BRO!

27:06.344 --> 27:09.931
YOU ARE AMAZING, DEREK!

27:09.965 --> 27:12.137
BYE, DEREK!

27:12.172 --> 27:12.689
BYE!

27:12.724 --> 27:13.931
BE CAREFUL.

27:13.965 --> 27:14.793
AIR HUG.

27:14.827 --> 27:16.344
OKAY, AIR HUG.

27:16.379 --> 27:17.413
HAVE A SEAT.

27:17.448 --> 27:19.827
I'M GOING TO STOP CALLING YOU
THAT NICKNAME.

27:19.862 --> 27:21.689
I CAN TELL YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.000
I DON'T MIND.

27:23.034 --> 27:24.827
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT CAUGHT ON
LIKE THAT.

27:24.862 --> 27:26.206
I CAN SAY NOTHING.

27:26.241 --> 27:27.034
ALL RIGHT.

27:27.068 --> 27:27.793
LET'S TALK ABOUT
THIS GAME.

27:27.827 --> 27:29.275
THIS HAS BEEN A BAD WEEK FOR
YOU.

27:29.310 --> 27:30.517
IT WAS ROUGH.

27:30.551 --> 27:34.310
A WEEK AGO TONIGHT
YOU LOST OUTER TO SARAH BETH TO

27:34.344 --> 27:36.068
BECOME CURRENT H.O.H. BY A
FRACTION OF A SECOND.

27:36.103 --> 27:37.172
I KNOW.

27:37.206 --> 27:40.620
THEN YOU HAD TWO
OPPORTUNITIES TO MAYBE WIN

27:40.655 --> 27:41.172
SAFETY.

27:41.206 --> 27:41.896
SALT IN THE WOUND!

27:41.931 --> 27:43.000
I'M SORRY.

27:43.034 --> 27:45.344
WE HAVE TO SPELL IT OUT TO
PEOPLE.

27:45.379 --> 27:48.172
THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY YOU TURNED
DOWN BY CHOOSING NOT TO PLAY IN

27:48.206 --> 27:49.310
THE HIGH ROLLERS ROOM.

27:49.344 --> 27:50.551
OKAY.

27:50.586 --> 27:53.517
CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE, EVEN
THOUGH YOU HAD THE MONEY TO

27:53.551 --> 27:54.724
PLAY.

27:54.758 --> 27:58.068
THE SECOND TIME YOU COULD HAVE
MAYBE GOTTEN SAFETY WAS THE

27:58.103 --> 28:00.310
P.O.V., BUT YOU WEREN'T PICKED
TO PLAY.

28:00.344 --> 28:01.206
YEAH.

28:01.241 --> 28:02.482
HOW ARE YOU FEELING
RIGHT NOW?

28:02.517 --> 28:05.068
OBVIOUSLY, YOU CAN TELL FROM
MY FACIAL REACTIONS IT SUCKS.

28:05.103 --> 28:08.275
I HAVE SO MUCH REGRET FROM THIS
WEEK.

28:08.310 --> 28:11.241
I WAS THINKING ABOUT A LONG-TERM
GAME, WHEN I DIDN'T REALIZE MY

28:11.275 --> 28:12.620
SHORT-TERM GAME WAS AT RISK.

28:12.655 --> 28:15.655
ALL I CAN DO NOW IS HOPE THERE'S
A BATTLE BACK.

28:15.689 --> 28:16.758
AND NO RISK, NO REWARD.

28:16.793 --> 28:19.172
BUT I TOOK A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH
RISK.

28:19.206 --> 28:21.344
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO
SAY TO AMERICA?

28:21.379 --> 28:24.827
AMERICA VOTED TWO WEEKS IN A ROW
TO GIVE YOU THE TOP AMOUNT THAT

28:24.862 --> 28:30.137
THEY COULD HAVE TO PLAY IN THE
HIGH ROLLER'S ROOM, 100 B.B.

28:30.172 --> 28:30.965
BUCKS EACH WEEK.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.137
AMERICA, I LOVE YOU ALL SO
MUCH.

28:34.172 --> 28:35.551
THANK YOU FOR VOTING FOR ME.

28:35.586 --> 28:37.413
I'M SO SORRY IF I LET YOU DOWN.

28:37.448 --> 28:42.034
I FEEL STUPID, BUT I TRIED MY
BEST IN THERE.

28:42.068 --> 28:45.862
IN THE FINAL MOMENTS
OF THIS INTERVIEW, WE SAW YOU

28:45.896 --> 28:47.137
AND HANNAH GREW VERY CLOSE.

28:47.172 --> 28:50.413
IT LOOKED LIKE THERE COULD BE A
SHOWMANCE, BUT BOTH OF YOU ARE

28:50.448 --> 28:51.000
VERY GAME FOCUSED.

28:51.034 --> 28:51.655
YEAH.

28:51.689 --> 28:52.862
WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:52.896 --> 28:55.344
YEAH, IT'S EXACTLY THAT.

28:55.379 --> 28:57.206
WE'RE SUPER GAME FOCUSED.

28:57.241 --> 28:58.517
LOOK, HANNAH IS AMAZING.

28:58.551 --> 29:02.310
I LOVE HER A LOT, BUT IN THERE,
YOU REALLY HAVE TO HAVE 100% OF

29:02.344 --> 29:05.344
YOUR ENERGY FOCUSED ON THE GAME
OR YOU END UP SITTING IN THIS

29:05.379 --> 29:06.310
CHAIR, HONESTLY.

29:06.344 --> 29:08.517
SO WE BOTH HAVE OUR HEAD IN THE
SAME PLACE.

29:08.551 --> 29:10.620
DOES THAT MEAN
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE THE TWO OF YOU

29:10.655 --> 29:11.241
MIGHT START DATING?

29:11.275 --> 29:14.413
EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.034
OOOH!

29:16.068 --> 29:16.379
DEREK X.!

29:16.413 --> 29:18.724
I LOVE IT!

29:18.758 --> 29:19.551
THROWING THAT BACK AT ME!

29:19.586 --> 29:21.655
ALL RIGHT, DON'T GO TOO FAR.

29:21.689 --> 29:22.758
OKAY.

29:22.793 --> 29:23.965
I HAVE MORE
QUESTIONS FOR YOU AFTER WE GET

29:24.000 --> 29:24.551
OFF THE AIR.

29:24.586 --> 29:25.379
ALL RIGHT.

29:25.413 --> 29:26.517
STAY RIGHT THERE
RIGHT NOW.

29:26.551 --> 29:29.310
TO SEE MY EXTENDED INTERVIEW
WITH DEREK X. AND ALL THE

29:29.344 --> 29:32.379
GOOD-BYE MESSAGES GO TO "BIG
BROTHER WATCH PARTY."

29:32.413 --> 29:39.103
OR "BIG BROTHER'S" INSTAGRAM
PAGE.

29:39.137 --> 29:42.172
IT'S TIME TO CROWN A NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD LIVE, BUT FIRST,

29:42.206 --> 29:44.275
EARLIER THIS WEEK, THE
HOUSEGUESTS PUT THE GAME ON HOLD

29:44.310 --> 29:49.206
SO THEY COULD WORK TOGETHER AND
DONATE THEIR TIME TO ASSEMBLE

29:49.241 --> 29:52.000
LIFE-SAVING EMERGENCY KITS UNDER
THE AMERICAN RED CROSS.

29:52.034 --> 30:01.310
AND IN HONOR OF CBS' PARTNERSHIP
WITH THE RED CROSS, I'M EXCITED

30:01.344 --> 30:04.448
TO ANNOUNCE "BIG BROTHER" WILL
BE DONATING $100 FOR EVERY BAG

30:04.482 --> 30:05.655
THE HOUSEGUESTS MADE.

30:05.689 --> 30:09.172
THAT'S A TOTAL OF $10,000 TO
HELP THE RED CROSS WITH THEIR

30:09.206 --> 30:11.137
CRUCIAL WORK.

30:11.172 --> 30:14.655
WE INVITE YOU TO EXPLORE THE
WAYS YOU CAN GET INVOLVED AND

30:14.689 --> 30:20.310
JOIN CBS IN BECOMING A NATION OF
DOERS BY DOING YOUR HART TO HELP

30:20.344 --> 30:21.275
OTHERS.

30:23.137 --> 30:27.068
CBS INVITES YOU TO BE A
NATION OF DOERS, DOING YOUR BEST

30:27.103 --> 30:29.275

OTHERS.

30:29.310 --> 30:33.275

30:39.000 --> 30:44.793
YOUR DONATION OF TIME AND
RESOURCES WILL MAKE A BIG

30:44.827 --> 30:45.241
DINCHES.

30:45.275 --> 30:46.206
DIFFERENCE.

30:46.241 --> 30:48.103
DOERS, IT'S TIME TO UNITE.

30:48.137 --> 30:50.827
-- LEARN MORE AT REDCROSS.

- CBS.

30:56.206 --> 30:57.758
WELCOME BACK TO "BIG
BROTHER."

30:57.793 --> 31:00.689
EARLIER, THE HOUSEGUESTS HAD A
SHORT TIME TO STUDY THE MEMORY

31:00.724 --> 31:04.965
WALL KNOWING THAT THE CONTENTS
DISPLAYED THERE WOULD BE CRUCIAL

31:05.000 --> 31:10.965
TO WINNING TONIGHT'S HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.965
DEFINITELY GOING TO BED EARLY

31:15.000 --> 31:15.310
TONIGHT.

31:15.344 --> 31:16.758
UH-HUH.

31:16.793 --> 31:21.758

31:21.793 --> 31:22.827
B.B. NFT'S DROPPING SOON.

31:22.862 --> 31:25.034
OH, MY GOSH!

31:25.068 --> 31:26.344
NFT'S.

31:26.379 --> 31:29.034
I SEE THE MEMORY WALL CHANGE
AND IT SAYS B.B. NFT'S DROPPING

31:29.068 --> 31:29.517
SOON.

31:29.551 --> 31:32.551
WHAT ARE NFT'S?

31:32.586 --> 31:35.793
NFT'S ARE LIKE PHOTOS OR
GIFs.

31:35.827 --> 31:41.137
YOU KNOW WHAT A GIF IS?

31:41.172 --> 31:43.620
GIVES OF US!

31:43.655 --> 31:44.827
I'M SUPER EXCITED.

31:44.862 --> 31:48.862
AS A SUPER FAN OF THIS SHOW I
KNOW THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE

31:48.896 --> 31:53.137
H.O.H. COMPETITION COMING UP.

32:01.206 --> 32:06.034
OH, NO!

32:06.068 --> 32:09.172
YES!

32:09.206 --> 32:11.379
SORRY.

32:11.413 --> 32:13.448
OH, MY GOD!

32:13.482 --> 32:19.379
THE MOON WALK!

32:19.413 --> 32:22.068
WATCH THE ARMS, AZAH, WATCH
THE ARMS!

32:22.103 --> 32:24.413
OH, HERE IT IS.

32:24.448 --> 32:28.000
I TRIED!

32:28.034 --> 32:33.689
WHEN I WIN THAT $750,000, THE
FIRST THING THAT I'M PURCHASING

32:33.724 --> 32:36.931
IS THAT MOON WALK NFT FOR
$5,000.

32:36.965 --> 32:39.034
I'M TRYING TO GET THAT
OBLITERATED FROM THE INTERNET.

32:39.068 --> 32:45.137
I LOVE SEEING ALL OF THESE
NFTs-- OTEV.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.551
THE FACE MASK.

32:46.586 --> 32:48.862
BUT THIS IS NOT ALL FUN AND
GAMES.

32:48.896 --> 32:52.965
I HAVE TO MEMORIZE ALL OF THESE
VIDEOS IF I WANT TO BE PREPARED

32:53.000 --> 32:55.068
TO WIN THE H.O.H. COMPETITION.

32:55.103 --> 32:59.172
THIS IS HARD.

32:59.206 --> 33:03.827
IT'S TIME FOR THE
LIVE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD

33:03.862 --> 33:04.965
COMPETITION.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.034
FREE FROM THE THREAT OF
EVICTION, THE H.O.H. MUST PUT

33:08.068 --> 33:09.827
TWO NOMINEES ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK.

33:09.862 --> 33:14.517
LET'S HEAD TO THE BACKYARD AND
GET THINGS STARTED.

33:14.551 --> 33:19.620
HOUSEGUESTS, THE POWER IS UP FOR
GRABS.

33:19.655 --> 33:24.275
SARAH BETH, AS OUTGOING HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD, YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE

33:24.310 --> 33:25.379
TO COMPETE TONIGHT.

33:25.413 --> 33:30.931
THIS COMPETITION IS CALLED "B.B.

33:30.965 --> 33:32.275
NFTs," AND HERE'S HOW IT
WORKS.

33:32.310 --> 33:36.034
EARLIER, YOU HAD TIME TO STUDY
NFTs ON THE MEMORY WALL.

33:36.068 --> 33:42.103
I WILL NOW ASK YOU A SERIES OF
TRUE OR FALSE QUESTIONS ABOUT

33:42.137 --> 33:43.517
THOSE NFTs.

33:43.551 --> 33:46.068
GET THE ANSWER RIGHT, YOU STAY
IN THE GAME.

33:46.103 --> 33:51.862
GET THE ANSWER WRONG, AND YOU
WILL IMMEDIATELY BE ELIMINATED.

33:51.896 --> 33:55.793
THE LAST PERSON STANDING AFTER
SEVEN QUESTIONS WILL BECOME THE

33:55.827 --> 33:58.344
NEW HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

33:58.379 --> 34:02.551
IF WE HAVE A TIE AFTER ALL THE
QUESTIONS ARE ASKED, WE WILL GO

34:02.586 --> 34:04.586
TO A THAI BREAKER.

34:04.620 --> 34:08.793
NOW, YOU WERE TOLD THAT THERE
WOULD BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU

34:08.827 --> 34:12.103
TO WIN EXTRA B.B. BUCKS IN

34:12.137 --> 34:13.655
