WEBVTT

00:04.773 --> 00:06.909
Oh, this is crazy.
You know, now I get

00:06.910 --> 00:09.979
why people hate us
when we block traffic.

00:09.980 --> 00:12.247
What the hell
are they building, anyway?

00:12.248 --> 00:13.716
According to that poster
on the fence,

00:13.717 --> 00:15.884
it's gonna be high-rise
condominiums and shops

00:15.885 --> 00:18.187
populated completely
by white people.

00:18.188 --> 00:20.322
What are you talking about?
There's a black guy right there.

00:20.323 --> 00:22.558
That's not a black guy.
That's a heat lamp.

00:22.559 --> 00:23.859
Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:23.860 --> 00:26.761
I was wondering why he was
wearing that Chinese hat.

00:27.796 --> 00:29.731
But what is going on with
this cement truck? Mm-hmm.

00:29.732 --> 00:31.633
Come on, move it, man.

00:31.634 --> 00:33.769
Let's give him
a little whoop-whoop.

00:33.770 --> 00:36.004
(siren whooping)

00:36.005 --> 00:38.540
Did that son of a bitch
just flip us the bird?

00:38.541 --> 00:40.008
Why did he do that?

00:40.009 --> 00:43.210
Now we got to get out
of the car.

00:45.914 --> 00:46.882
You know what he did?

00:46.883 --> 00:48.283
He put bad karma
out in the world,

00:48.284 --> 00:49.751
and now it's coming home
to roost.

00:49.752 --> 00:51.853
Well, which is why I choose
to radiate positive energy.

00:51.854 --> 00:53.288
Universe is
a cosmic penny jar...

00:53.289 --> 00:55.257
never take one,
always leave one.

00:55.258 --> 00:58.226
Aw, he's got a busted taillight.
That's a $100 fine.

00:58.227 --> 00:59.427
<i>Namaste,</i> universe.

00:59.428 --> 01:01.629
MAN:
Watch out!

01:04.465 --> 01:06.166
Whoa.

01:08.303 --> 01:09.838
Well, you go
write the ticket.

01:09.839 --> 01:12.273
I got to go change my pants.

SAMUEL:
Gentlemen,

01:49.168 --> 01:50.135
your booth awaits.

01:50.136 --> 01:52.770
Uh, one tea and one coffee?

01:57.776 --> 01:59.244
I love you.

01:59.245 --> 02:03.013
I might not always like you,
but I love you.

02:04.616 --> 02:08.519
Well, someone's getting
an extra sausage link.

02:10.788 --> 02:12.824
(sighs)

02:12.825 --> 02:15.192
That could have been it, man.

02:15.194 --> 02:17.896
I mean, what would have
been my last words?

02:17.897 --> 02:19.963
You know, what was
the last thing that I said?

02:19.965 --> 02:22.499
I don't know, something about
crapping your pants.

02:25.370 --> 02:28.972
I guess there's no way
to make that sound heroic.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.508
Yeah, I just keep
replaying the scene

02:30.509 --> 02:31.976
over and over in my head, man.

02:31.977 --> 02:34.412
If we're in that squad car
for ten more seconds,

02:34.413 --> 02:35.914
we're not here.

02:35.915 --> 02:37.315
Yeah, we are alive by the grace

02:37.316 --> 02:39.750
of a truck driver's
middle finger.

02:40.752 --> 02:43.887
God bless that rude
son of a bitch.

02:43.889 --> 02:45.123
You know, this is
the kind of thing

02:45.124 --> 02:46.590
that makes you take
a hard look at your life.

02:46.592 --> 02:49.093
You know? Did I live
the best one that I could?

02:49.094 --> 02:51.595
Did I carpe my Diem?

02:51.597 --> 02:54.265
Yeah, uh... it really
makes you think.

02:54.266 --> 02:57.401
You know? I mean...
Yeah.

02:57.402 --> 02:59.569
Yeah, I'm good.

03:01.372 --> 03:02.940
What... Are you telling me
that you're satisfied

03:02.941 --> 03:04.407
with everything
that you did in your life?

03:04.409 --> 03:06.511
Well, there was that mullet
and that Michael Jackson glove

03:06.512 --> 03:08.212
I wore in my senior picture,
but overall,

03:08.213 --> 03:11.616
I'd say A-plus-plus...
would recommend to a friend.

03:11.617 --> 03:12.650
All right, well, not me.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.085
After that accident,
the one face

03:14.086 --> 03:16.319
that's been popping up
in my mind is Victoria's.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.521
Well, what's wrong with that?

03:17.522 --> 03:19.123
It means you're finally
in a good relationship.

03:19.124 --> 03:21.459
No drama, no crying
phone calls at 3:00 a.m.

03:21.460 --> 03:24.761
I am so glad to not be
getting those from you anymore.

03:25.796 --> 03:27.465
Hey, man, I'm just happy

03:27.466 --> 03:29.066
that I've been given
a second chance

03:29.067 --> 03:32.103
to do something that I should've
done a long time ago.

03:32.104 --> 03:34.537
Mike, I'm gonna
ask her to marry me.

03:37.541 --> 03:39.576
Really?
I love her.

03:39.578 --> 03:41.712
I want to spend the rest
of my life with her.

03:41.713 --> 03:43.479
And the rest of my life
starts right now.

03:43.481 --> 03:46.750
Okay, you... you sure this isn't
just some knee-jerk reaction

03:46.751 --> 03:50.053
to almost getting panini'ed
in the squad car?

03:51.221 --> 03:53.022
I'm as sure as I've been
about anything.

03:53.024 --> 03:55.292
Well, then that's fantastic.
Congratulations.

03:55.293 --> 03:57.360
Thank you.
Big news, Samuel.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.963
Carl is gonna ask
Victoria to marry him.

03:59.964 --> 04:01.464
No.

04:01.466 --> 04:03.300
Well, she can do much better,

04:03.301 --> 04:05.835
but I'm so happy for you.

04:05.837 --> 04:07.638
Hey, let's make this official.

04:07.639 --> 04:10.172
Mike Biggs,
will you be my best man?

04:10.174 --> 04:13.243
Course, I'd be honored.
All right, then.

04:13.244 --> 04:14.678
Oh, and Samuel?
Yes?

04:14.679 --> 04:17.180
Can I get some
lemon for my tea?

04:17.180 --> 04:19.382
(indistinct conversation)

04:26.957 --> 04:29.326
Yep. It was just
a freak accident, man.

04:29.327 --> 04:32.429
One bolt cracked, and bam!
Carl and I could've ended up

04:32.430 --> 04:34.697
like a couple
of Girl Scout Thin Mints.

04:37.167 --> 04:41.070
Oh, my God. I am so thankful
that you weren't hurt.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.240
We all are.
Yeah, but if he had to go,

04:43.241 --> 04:45.507
flattened by a girder's
not a bad way.

04:45.509 --> 04:47.309
Yeah, it's quick, painless,

04:47.311 --> 04:51.348
and you were on the job, so
the payout's got to be huge.

04:51.349 --> 04:52.949
Oh, and that's-that's
just from the city.

04:52.950 --> 04:54.884
The big jackpot
comes from the settlement

04:54.885 --> 04:56.353
with the construction company.

04:56.354 --> 04:59.389
Oh, yeah, that kind
of negligence...

04:59.390 --> 05:00.790
we'd spend the
rest of our days

05:00.791 --> 05:03.593
living on a yacht
off Myrtle Beach. Oh.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.962
Wearing nothing
but sunscreen and a smile

05:05.963 --> 05:09.798
on the SS <i>Mike.</i>
Mmm.

05:12.602 --> 05:14.803
I'm still alive.

05:16.439 --> 05:19.608
Yeah, and it's my money.

05:19.610 --> 05:22.011
Well, I guess we've
all learned something

05:22.012 --> 05:23.745
about each other, haven't we?

05:25.348 --> 05:27.749
You two are not invited
on the yacht.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.221
Are you sure you're okay?

05:33.223 --> 05:36.359
You know, I'm more than okay.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.762
When I almost died
today, I realized...

05:39.763 --> 05:42.665
I don't have any regrets.

05:42.666 --> 05:45.066
Except that maybe I
didn't meet you sooner.

05:45.068 --> 05:47.236
Aw.

05:47.237 --> 05:49.238
You know, you were already
getting some action tonight,

05:49.239 --> 05:51.439
but now you are really
gonna get some.

05:52.308 --> 05:53.743
Oh, hey, by the way,

05:53.744 --> 05:57.446
Carl invited us to dinner with
Victoria and him on Friday.

05:57.447 --> 06:00.615
Oh. Okay.
Yeah, uh, I can't tell you why.

06:00.617 --> 06:03.151
But it's very important
that we be there.

06:03.153 --> 06:05.854
All right.

06:05.856 --> 06:09.225
I mean, it's really,
really, really important

06:09.226 --> 06:12.127
that we be there.

06:12.128 --> 06:14.963
Does Carl have another Groupon?

06:14.965 --> 06:17.766
Hmm?
You're close.

06:17.767 --> 06:20.101
He's gonna propose to Victoria.

06:20.103 --> 06:22.037
He's gonna propose?
I didn't say anything.

06:22.038 --> 06:24.405
You said exactly that. I know, I
know, I know! But don't tell anybody.

06:24.407 --> 06:26.841
Don't tell anybody.
He wants it to be a surprise.

06:26.843 --> 06:28.077
Well, of course not.

06:28.078 --> 06:29.545
I'm not gonna ruin
Victoria's biggest night.

06:29.546 --> 06:31.246
Ooh! I can help her
plan the wedding.

06:31.247 --> 06:34.549
I can fix all the mistakes
we made with ours.

06:36.485 --> 06:38.786
What... Wh-What mistakes?
Our wedding was beautiful.

06:38.788 --> 06:41.056
It was good.
It wasn't perfect.

06:41.057 --> 06:43.325
Let's just say, if a girder
landed on me, I'd still

06:43.326 --> 06:46.827
be seeing your Fudgie
the Whale groomsman cake.

06:49.865 --> 06:51.500
My only regret is...

06:51.501 --> 06:53.634
I didn't get to marry you twice.

06:54.770 --> 06:56.071
I already said you're
getting action.

06:56.072 --> 06:58.339
It's not gonna happen sooner.

06:59.541 --> 07:01.742
I almost died.

07:03.278 --> 07:05.012
All right, let's go.

07:05.014 --> 07:07.214
(giggles)

07:12.187 --> 07:14.489
(Molly, Victoria
and Joyce squealing)

07:14.490 --> 07:16.358
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

07:16.359 --> 07:18.859
Hey, hey, hey!
Is every-everything okay?

07:24.266 --> 07:26.900
Yeah. Why?

07:30.238 --> 07:32.439
I-I thought I heard something.

07:34.609 --> 07:37.111
No.

07:38.913 --> 07:41.616
Not here.
No.

07:41.617 --> 07:44.685
Maybe it was from outside.
Oh.

07:44.687 --> 07:48.121
Do you still hear it?

07:51.125 --> 07:53.060
No.

07:53.062 --> 07:56.430
Then I guess it's your word
against ours.

08:00.968 --> 08:02.569
All right,
I'm gonna get going.

08:02.571 --> 08:03.770
Okay.

08:03.772 --> 08:05.673
Bye, hon.

08:05.674 --> 08:07.941
Have a great day at work.
I will.

08:10.978 --> 08:12.245
(door closes)

08:12.247 --> 08:14.715
(both whooping)
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

08:14.716 --> 08:17.452
Oh... Now, remember,
you can't say a word.

08:17.453 --> 08:21.388
Oh, don't worry, I can keep
a secret. I'm not like you.

08:24.058 --> 08:25.559
I'm just so proud of myself.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.461
Both my girls married off,

08:27.462 --> 08:30.931
and neither one of
you knocked up. Aw.

08:30.932 --> 08:32.967
I'd like to take credit,
but it's just

08:32.967 --> 08:35.434
dumb luck, really, so...

08:35.437 --> 08:38.304
This is so exciting. I'm
thinking a winter wedding.

08:38.306 --> 08:40.941
Neutral palette,
harps play as you walk

08:40.942 --> 08:42.942
down the aisle strewn
with rose petals.

08:42.943 --> 08:46.246
Or we could do it in Vegas
dressed like Bonnie and Clyde.

08:48.082 --> 08:51.684
Don't ruin this for me, okay?

08:56.257 --> 08:57.925
Come on, girls,
we're gonna be late.

08:57.926 --> 09:00.693
So, where you going
for dinner?

09:00.695 --> 09:02.161
Uh, Permesso.

09:02.997 --> 09:05.298
I approve.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.335
Thank you. So does Yelp.

09:08.336 --> 09:11.338
Four stars and only
two dollar signs.

09:11.339 --> 09:16.576
(to tune of "Bridal Chorus"):
♪ Here comes Victoria. ♪

09:16.578 --> 09:20.046
Look at me.
My hands are sweating.

09:20.814 --> 09:24.417
Take good care
of my little girl.

09:24.419 --> 09:26.486
I will. And Mike's
paying for Molly, too.

09:26.487 --> 09:28.689
We worked all that out.

09:28.690 --> 09:31.190
Ooh, I hope you like seafood.

09:31.192 --> 09:34.860
For as long
as we both shall live.

09:35.696 --> 09:37.363
MOLLY:
Sorry.

09:37.365 --> 09:39.232
I bought a new camera.
Just testing it out.

09:39.233 --> 09:42.502
And one more with the mother
of the... Victoria.

09:42.503 --> 09:43.969
Ah.

09:43.971 --> 09:45.905
Okay, let's get a move on.

09:45.907 --> 09:47.140
Go. Have dinner.

09:47.141 --> 09:50.409
Mazel tov!
(chuckles)

09:54.080 --> 09:56.181
(quietly):
You got the ring?

09:56.183 --> 09:58.417
What ring?

09:58.419 --> 10:01.220
The ring you're gonna use
to propose to Victoria with.

10:01.222 --> 10:03.023
Oh, that? Well, I
changed my mind.

10:03.024 --> 10:04.190
That ain't happening.

10:04.191 --> 10:06.559
Whoa!
What are you talking about?

10:06.560 --> 10:09.428
You can't just ask someone to
marry you and then take it back.

10:09.430 --> 10:10.996
I didn't ask anyone to marry me.

10:10.998 --> 10:12.966
Well, you asked me!

10:12.967 --> 10:15.402
I mean, you told me you
were gonna ask Victoria.

10:15.403 --> 10:18.270
I mean, that is practically
a verbal contract.

10:18.272 --> 10:20.106
We almost got killed.
I said a lot of things.

10:20.107 --> 10:21.941
I told Samuel
he could have my ten-speed bike.

10:21.942 --> 10:23.843
I'm sorry he shaved his legs
and bought a helmet,

10:23.844 --> 10:26.278
but I'm taking
my bike back, too.

10:26.280 --> 10:28.014
Yeah, but you set
things in motion.

10:28.015 --> 10:30.849
Nothing got set in motion.
The only person I told was you.

10:30.851 --> 10:33.353
Yeah, but y...

10:33.354 --> 10:36.122
you got my hopes up!

10:36.123 --> 10:39.191
And now I am very
disappointed.

10:39.193 --> 10:41.660
Aw. You want to be
my brother-in-law.

10:41.662 --> 10:44.463
(chuckles) Look, don't worry.
I love Victoria, okay?

10:44.465 --> 10:46.933
The time will come, all right?
But this is a big decision.

10:46.934 --> 10:48.300
There's no need
to rush into it.

10:48.302 --> 10:50.870
All I can say is, you
picked a hell of a time

10:50.871 --> 10:53.939
to stop jumping into
things like an idiot.

10:53.941 --> 10:55.373
Thank you.

10:57.643 --> 10:59.979
Thank God I got action
yesterday,

10:59.980 --> 11:03.448
'cause I am headed
for a drought.

11:15.868 --> 11:18.170
(chuckling)

11:18.171 --> 11:21.140
Hey. You guys should see
the new squad car they gave us.

11:21.141 --> 11:24.143
Same model, same features,
but it's got that new car smell,

11:24.144 --> 11:26.512
you know, as opposed
to that old Mike smell.

11:26.513 --> 11:28.580
(laughter)

11:28.581 --> 11:31.082
Oh, very nice.

11:31.084 --> 11:32.351
CARL: Oh, no.
We didn't order champagne.

11:32.352 --> 11:34.385
The Groupon says ice tea only.

11:34.387 --> 11:38.322
Oh. This is compliments
of me and Mike.

11:38.324 --> 11:39.892
Well, we'll just have
the one glass.

11:39.893 --> 11:42.027
Everybody can take a pull.

11:42.028 --> 11:43.862
Keep pouring. Keep pouring.

11:43.863 --> 11:46.265
(quietly): Can you not be
so cheap just for one night?

11:46.266 --> 11:47.899
This is a special occasion.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.367
Or a very uncomfortable dinner.

11:49.369 --> 11:51.303
Can I talk to you
for a sec, Mol?

11:51.304 --> 11:54.406
No, because I bet Carl
is just about to make a toast.

11:54.407 --> 11:57.142
No, I'm not.

11:57.143 --> 12:00.211
Oh, that's right.
Those come later.

12:01.747 --> 12:03.348
Come on.
Uh, it'll just take a second.

12:03.349 --> 12:05.817
Uh... oh, I want you
to help me pick out a lobster.

12:05.818 --> 12:07.052
You hate lobster.

12:07.053 --> 12:08.286
No, I'm allergic.

12:08.287 --> 12:10.922
But I'm willing to give
it another try. Come on!

12:10.923 --> 12:13.592
All right. A wife's job
is never done. You'll see.

12:13.593 --> 12:15.826
Very soon.

12:19.264 --> 12:22.133
Mmm.

12:22.134 --> 12:24.135
So...

12:24.136 --> 12:26.170
So.

12:27.038 --> 12:30.307
So...

12:31.142 --> 12:33.243
So?

12:34.479 --> 12:36.313
So!

12:38.183 --> 12:41.186
Ooh, this guy.
He wants out anyway.

12:41.187 --> 12:44.122
Come on. Let's go back
before he gives her the ring.

12:44.123 --> 12:45.423
There is no ring.
(gasps)

12:45.424 --> 12:47.325
He's gonna let her pick out
the one she wants.

12:47.326 --> 12:49.093
Oh, I wish
you would've done that.

12:49.094 --> 12:50.495
What?

12:50.496 --> 12:52.095
What?
No, listen to me.

12:52.097 --> 12:54.499
Carl changed his mind.
He's not proposing tonight.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.634
I'm sorry. What's that?
Well, he thought about it,

12:57.636 --> 12:59.170
and he doesn't want
to rush into anything.

12:59.171 --> 13:00.237
So no harm, no foul.

13:00.239 --> 13:02.373
You know? I think I
will have the lobster.

13:02.374 --> 13:04.342
You got Benadryl, right?

13:04.343 --> 13:06.644
Are you crazy?
Carl can't back out now.

13:06.645 --> 13:08.246
There are things in motion.

13:08.247 --> 13:10.782
What's in motion?
You know, things.

13:10.783 --> 13:12.950
Oh. Did you tell Victoria?

13:12.951 --> 13:14.385
No.
Molly.

13:14.386 --> 13:16.988
Of course I did.
(groans)

13:16.989 --> 13:18.256
Well, why did you do that?

13:18.257 --> 13:20.191
It was supposed to be just
between the two of us.

13:20.192 --> 13:22.260
No, this was supposed
to be between you and Carl,

13:22.261 --> 13:24.995
and you blew it,
with your big, stupid mouth.

13:24.997 --> 13:27.164
Really? That's the angle
you're taking? Yeah.

13:27.165 --> 13:28.666
And your friend's an idiot.

13:28.667 --> 13:31.402
Well, now that I can get behind.

13:31.403 --> 13:34.071
Victoria, can I talk to you
for a second?

13:34.072 --> 13:35.639
If it's about picking
the lobster,

13:35.640 --> 13:38.709
I don't want any part of it.
Let somebody else play God.

13:38.710 --> 13:41.512
No, it's not about that.
Just come with me.

13:41.513 --> 13:43.347
Well, hold on. The waiter's
been by, like, three times.

13:43.348 --> 13:45.049
We should probably figure out
what we're ordering first.

13:45.050 --> 13:47.551
Yeah, sounds good.
Man,

13:47.552 --> 13:49.520
I cannot decide what I want.

13:49.521 --> 13:51.855
No, you cannot.

13:51.856 --> 13:54.925
Too many choices. A man
shouldn't have to pick just one.

13:54.926 --> 13:56.927
God, you make me sick.

13:56.928 --> 13:58.095
Mol.

13:58.096 --> 13:59.830
Easy, easy.

13:59.831 --> 14:01.031
I'm sorry,
did I say something?

14:01.032 --> 14:02.366
No, you didn't.

14:02.367 --> 14:05.736
Because you're a wishy-washy
child who can't commit!

14:05.737 --> 14:07.170
What is going on?

14:07.172 --> 14:10.240
Nothing, sweetie. Unfortunately,
<i>nothing</i> is going on.

14:10.241 --> 14:12.676
Isn't that right, Carl?

14:12.677 --> 14:15.579
Well, that all depends
if Mike opened his big mouth.

14:15.580 --> 14:17.581
Well, of course he did.

14:17.582 --> 14:20.750
Focus. He's the idiot.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.587
So, wait, you thought
I was gonna propose?

14:25.422 --> 14:27.891
I did.

14:27.892 --> 14:29.326
Oh, no.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.361
But you're not?

14:31.362 --> 14:34.031
Victoria, I love you.

14:34.032 --> 14:35.332
I-I really do.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.300
And, you know, one day,
who knows?

14:37.301 --> 14:39.569
You know? But whatever
you thought was happening

14:39.570 --> 14:41.037
is not gonna happen.

14:41.038 --> 14:42.705
Well, at least not tonight.

14:43.540 --> 14:45.342
Oh, thank goodness.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.843
What's that, now?

14:46.844 --> 14:48.111
Are you ready to order?

14:48.112 --> 14:49.813
What's your soup?

14:49.814 --> 14:51.248
Can we have a minute, please?

14:51.249 --> 14:52.616
VICTORIA:
I mean, I love you,

14:52.617 --> 14:55.217
but I am not ready to marry you.

14:55.219 --> 14:57.420
What? When you first
spilled the beans, I got

14:57.421 --> 14:59.990
so caught up in the excitement
and the idea of having a wedding

14:59.991 --> 15:01.758
that I didn't really think
about what came after that.

15:01.759 --> 15:03.927
So, what, y-you're saying
you're relieved

15:03.928 --> 15:06.596
that you don't have to spend
the rest of your life with me?

15:06.597 --> 15:09.432
Oh, here comes the spinout.

15:09.433 --> 15:10.834
Hold on a second.
Let's say

15:10.835 --> 15:12.102
I did ask you to marry me.

15:12.103 --> 15:14.170
But you didn't.
But if I did.

15:14.171 --> 15:15.405
Would you have said yes?

15:15.406 --> 15:17.373
Carl, come on.
That's like asking, if a chicken

15:17.374 --> 15:20.275
laid an egg in the forest,
would you hear it?

15:24.180 --> 15:26.816
I guess it was a good thing
I didn't ruin your life

15:26.817 --> 15:29.418
by offering to love and cherish
you till death do us part.

15:29.420 --> 15:30.620
What are you getting
so mad about?

15:30.621 --> 15:31.788
You didn't want
to marry me, either.

15:31.789 --> 15:33.256
No, I did.
And then I didn't.

15:33.257 --> 15:35.124
And then I thought
maybe someday.

15:35.125 --> 15:37.293
Sounds to me like you don't know
what the hell you want.

15:37.294 --> 15:40.096
What I want is for you to not
want me to want to marry you.

15:40.097 --> 15:42.330
Is that so hard
to understand?

15:45.201 --> 15:47.603
Can you believe this?

15:47.604 --> 15:50.705
I was so close to planning
the perfect wedding.

15:51.874 --> 15:54.544
Eh. Hey, maybe
we can renew our vows.

15:54.545 --> 15:57.146
Ooh, how about
we do it in Vegas?

15:57.147 --> 16:01.716
God, why do you people want
to ruin everything for me?

16:06.188 --> 16:08.124
A little higher.
Are you kidding me?

16:08.125 --> 16:11.961
I'm on the step that says,
"This is not a step."

16:11.962 --> 16:13.162
(blowing party horn)

16:13.163 --> 16:15.431
Congratulations!
Oh, no.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.099
Take it down.

16:17.100 --> 16:19.201
Take it all down.

16:19.202 --> 16:20.402
She said no?

16:20.403 --> 16:21.437
He didn't ask.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.706
And then she said no.

16:23.707 --> 16:25.841
I'm getting my stuff
and I'm getting out of here.

16:25.842 --> 16:28.277
Go ahead. Be a baby.
Need help changing your diaper?

16:28.278 --> 16:31.847
CARL: Oh, no.
Don't try and get sexy with me.

16:31.848 --> 16:34.216
Well, on the bright side,
that's the last time

16:34.217 --> 16:35.985
Carl tells me a secret.

16:35.986 --> 16:38.020
(sighs)
I love you, Mike,

16:38.021 --> 16:40.188
but you've got a big mouth.

16:52.820 --> 16:54.855
Oh, this thing is nice.

16:54.856 --> 16:56.423
Dual climate control.

16:56.424 --> 16:58.759
Hey, you blast the heat,
I'll blast the cold,

16:58.760 --> 17:01.794
see if we can't make it
rain in here.

17:02.663 --> 17:04.665
I liked the way it was.

17:04.665 --> 17:06.666
Well, you don't
really have a choice.

17:06.667 --> 17:09.670
I mean, that thing
was destroyed.

17:09.671 --> 17:12.039
Publicly.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.406
In front of our very eyes.

17:15.375 --> 17:18.077
Yeah, but maybe
we could've fixed it.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.013
Look, I-I know you loved
how things were, but...

17:21.015 --> 17:22.983
let-let's be honest.

17:22.983 --> 17:26.319
It wasn't exactly perfect;
Very high-maintenance.

17:26.320 --> 17:29.423
Yeah, but there was
a comfort level there.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.925
You know, we knew each other.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.594
Plus, I loved
that beautiful trunk.

17:35.662 --> 17:38.332
Eh... in time, you'll forget
about the old one

17:38.333 --> 17:40.300
and learn to love a new one.

17:40.301 --> 17:43.070
Uh, maybe you'll love it
even more.

17:43.071 --> 17:45.105
It does ride nice.

17:45.106 --> 17:46.473
Very smooth.

17:46.474 --> 17:50.377
Ah, see? There you go.
Focus on what's ahead of you.

17:50.378 --> 17:52.311
That's right.

17:52.313 --> 17:53.847
Only thing I see
in my rearview mirror

17:53.848 --> 17:55.815
is a handsome, eligible man
who bowls in the 180s

17:55.816 --> 17:58.851
and makes one heck of
a mock apple pie. (chuckles)

17:58.853 --> 18:01.955
Exactly. Thanks, man.
You're a good friend.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.024
Ah, glad I could help.

18:04.025 --> 18:05.492
Mike?
Yeah.

18:05.493 --> 18:07.460
(choking up):
I miss my old squad car.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.962
All right. Okay.
All right. It's okay.

18:09.963 --> 18:11.281
Breathe.
