WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:03.960
YOU EXPECT US
TO BEAT THE TITANS
DRESSED LIKE THIS?

00:04.134 --> 00:05.396
MAYBE
AT A COSTUME PARTY.

00:05.570 --> 00:06.832
Chris: THAT'S
NOT A COSTUME.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.618
THAT REPRESENTS
YOUR NEW POSITION AND POWER.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.750
POWER.
POWER'S GOOD

00:11.924 --> 00:13.839
I LIKE POWER.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.102
WHY DO I LIKE POWER?

00:15.276 --> 00:17.017
BECAUSE YOU ARE
THE GODDESS OF WAR.

00:17.191 --> 00:18.496
AH!

00:18.670 --> 00:20.194
WELL, I GUESS
THAT EXPLAINS
THE PITCHFORK.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.283
IT'S NOT A PITCHFORK.
IT'S A TRIDENT.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.067
BE CAREFUL.
THAT'S A FORMIDABLE WEAPON.

00:24.241 --> 00:25.155
RIGHT ON.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.200
WHO WANTS
TO FIGHT?

00:26.374 --> 00:28.115
I'M A LOVER,
NOT A FIGHTER.

00:28.289 --> 00:29.638
YOU'RE THE GODDESS
OF LOVE.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.335
Piper: NATURALLY.

00:31.509 --> 00:33.294
WELL, THEN,
THAT MUST MAKE ME
THE GODDESS OF SANITY,

00:33.468 --> 00:35.165
BECAUSE I FIND
THIS RIDICULOUS.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.124
ACTUALLY, LEO GAVE YOU
DOMINION OVER THE EARTH

00:37.298 --> 00:38.821
AND ALL ITS NATURAL ELEMENTS.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.866
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
LEO DID THIS TO US?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.520
Phoebe: CHRIS...

00:42.694 --> 00:43.826
YOU NEVER TOLD US.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.828
DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND
IN THE FUTURE?

00:46.829 --> 00:48.222
AS YOU CAN SEE,

00:48.396 --> 00:49.527
ALL OF YOU HAVE
DRIVES AND URGES

00:49.701 --> 00:50.615
BASED ON YOUR POWERS.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.226
DON'T LET
THEM DISTRACT YOU.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.489
ALL RIGHT? STAY FOCUSED--

00:54.663 --> 00:56.447
FOCUSED ON THE TITANS.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.493
HOLD IT, PAL. I DON'T
KNOW WHAT KIND OF GAME
YOU'RE RUNNING HERE,

00:58.667 --> 01:01.017
BUT LEO IS
NOT IN THE GOD-MAKING
BUSINESS.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.758
HOW OLD ARE YOU,
ANYWAY?

01:02.932 --> 01:04.455
THE ELDERS FORBID IT,
AND, IF ANYTHING,

01:04.629 --> 01:05.891
LEO IS A COMPANY MAN.

01:06.066 --> 01:06.936
THE ELDERS DID FORBID IT,

01:07.110 --> 01:08.242
AND GUESS WHAT?

01:08.416 --> 01:10.809
THEY'RE DEAD,
MOST OF 'EM.

01:10.983 --> 01:12.681
LEO'S IN CHARGE
UP THERE NOW, AND HE'S
TAKING A HUGE RISK

01:12.855 --> 01:14.422
THAT YOU THREE
WON'T LOSE YOUR HUMANITY

01:14.596 --> 01:16.946
LIKE THE ANCIENT GREEK--
[GASPS] WHOA!

01:17.120 --> 01:19.209
YOU KILLED
THE ELDERS.

01:19.383 --> 01:20.602
YOU COULD'VE
PREVENTED IT!

01:20.776 --> 01:22.082
I SAY
WE CASTRATE HIM.

01:22.256 --> 01:23.692
[GASPS] A LITTLE CONTROL
HERE, LADIES, PLEASE?

01:23.866 --> 01:26.260
OH, OH, CAN'T WE FIGURE OUT
SOMETHING ELSE TO CUT OFF?

01:29.437 --> 01:30.655
I TOLD YOU,

01:30.829 --> 01:32.614
STAY FOCUSED.

01:32.788 --> 01:35.312
IN MY FUTURE,
ALL THE ELDERS WERE KILLED.

01:35.486 --> 01:37.619
THAT'S WHY I CAME BACK,
TO HELP LEO GIVE YOU THE POWER

01:37.793 --> 01:39.316
SO THIS WOULD NEVER
HAVE TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

01:39.490 --> 01:40.883
HEY, GUYS,
WATCH THIS.

01:45.888 --> 01:47.933
PUT THAT THING DOWN.
YOU'RE GONNA
HURT SOMEONE!

01:48.108 --> 01:49.587
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

01:49.761 --> 01:50.806
DO YOU KNOW THE KIND
OF DAMAGE THIS THING
COULD DO?

01:50.980 --> 01:52.199
A LOT.

01:52.373 --> 01:54.505
PAIGE, MAKE LOVE, NOT...

01:54.679 --> 01:55.724
YOU KNOW.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.943
THERE'S NO DOOR
LOVE CAN'T OPEN,

01:58.118 --> 02:00.120
NO WALL LOVE CAN'T CLIMB,

02:00.294 --> 02:03.297
NO HURDLE LOVE CAN'T...
HURDLE.

02:03.471 --> 02:04.950
THIS IS LEO'S STRATEGY?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.691
WELL, HE MUST'VE
LOST IT UP THERE,

02:06.865 --> 02:08.389
BECAUSE THESE GIRLS
CAN'T BE SEEN IN PUBLIC,
MUCH LESS--

02:08.563 --> 02:10.130
OHH, THAT REMINDS ME!

02:10.304 --> 02:11.870
I'M LATE
FOR THE BACHELOR AUCTION.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.655
I'M GONNA GO PICK UP
A GUY OR TWO...

02:13.829 --> 02:15.526
OR 12. [SNAPS]

02:15.700 --> 02:16.701

02:16.875 --> 02:18.616
OOH, THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA.

02:18.790 --> 02:21.358
I'M GONNA GO GET IN
SOME TARGET PRACTICE
WITH SOME DEMONS.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.360
WATCH OUT, TITANS.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.408
I KNEW THIS
WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

02:27.582 --> 02:28.757
YOU GOTTA GO AFTER 'EM.

02:28.931 --> 02:30.150
OH, NO, NO, NO.
THIS WAS YOUR BIG PLAN.

02:30.324 --> 02:31.586
YOU CLEAN UP THE MESS.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.415
NO, YOUR ROLE
IS TO PROVIDE BALANCE.

02:34.589 --> 02:36.678
THAT'S WHY YOU FEEL
SO GROUNDED AND IN CONTROL.

02:36.852 --> 02:39.028
WOW, CHRIS, THAT WAS
ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD.

02:39.202 --> 02:40.290
YOU ALMOST SOUNDED
LIKE A WHITELIGHTER.

02:40.464 --> 02:42.118
TOO BAD
I ALREADY HAVE ONE.

02:42.292 --> 02:43.772
AND IF HE WOULD LIKE ME
TO DO SOMETHING,

02:43.946 --> 02:45.643
HE CAN COME DOWN
AND TELL ME HIMSELF.

02:45.817 --> 02:47.079
DO YOU HEAR THAT?!

02:47.254 --> 02:49.604
YOU WANT LEO?

02:49.778 --> 02:52.084
HMM? THEN VANQUISH
THE TITANS.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.869
IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT,
YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT

02:54.043 --> 02:56.219
WHAT A WORLD
OF DARKNESS FEELS LIKE,

02:56.393 --> 02:57.525
MY WORLD.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.537
I CAN SENSE WHAT'S LEFT
OF THE ELDERS.

03:09.711 --> 03:12.627
THEY'RE SCARED AND
RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES.

03:12.801 --> 03:15.804
YOU'RE STILL ANGRY WITH ME
FOR KILLING HER, AREN'T YOU?

03:16.805 --> 03:18.154
DEMETRIUS, I'M SORRY.

03:18.328 --> 03:19.851
META WAS A DISTRACTION.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.157
ONCE WE CONTROL
THE HEAVENS,

03:21.331 --> 03:24.334
YOU CAN HAVE
ANY WOMAN YOU WANT.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.206
I WANT YOU TO KNOW I DID
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.730
WE NEEDED
TO HIT THE ELDERS
HARD AND FAST,

03:28.904 --> 03:30.471
AND WE DID, RIGHT?

03:32.124 --> 03:33.517
DEMETRIUS...

03:34.997 --> 03:36.172
LET'S GO FINISH OFF
THE ELDERS.

05:11.659 --> 05:12.703

THE BIDDING?

05:42.124 --> 05:43.647

07:12.910 --> 07:14.172

ONE OF MY POWERS

07:14.346 --> 07:15.478
TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOU.

07:17.262 --> 07:19.264
OH, I'M JUST
BUILDING AN ARMY.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.266
I FIGURED
WHAT BETTER WAY
TO SMITE THE TITANS

07:21.441 --> 07:22.790
THAN WITH HORDES

19:44.748 --> 19:46.402
ACTUALLY, THEY NEED LEO.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.317
LOOK, WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST GO DEAL WITH THEM?

19:48.491 --> 19:49.666
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
CHRIS?

19:49.840 --> 19:51.625
THE ALL-KNOWING
RUNNING OUT OF ANSWERS?

19:51.799 --> 19:53.235
YES! YES, I AM!

19:53.409 --> 19:55.019
IF THAT WILL MOTIVATE YOU,
YES, I'M LOSING CONTROL,

19:55.194 --> 19:56.804
BECAUSE I'M WATCHING
HISTORY REPEAT ITSELF,

19:56.978 --> 19:58.762
AND NOBODY'S WILLING TO DO
A DAMN THING ABOUT IT!

19:58.936 --> 20:00.721
I FEEL YOUR FRUSTRATION.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.552
PIPER,

20:05.726 --> 20:06.466
IF IT HELPS,

20:06.640 --> 20:07.728
I GET IT.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.730
OK? I DO. REALLY.

20:09.904 --> 20:10.992
YOU NEED LEO.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.820
YOUR SISTERS NEED LEO.

20:12.994 --> 20:13.908
BUT IF YOU CAN'T STOP--

20:14.082 --> 20:15.083
YOU FORGOT THE BABY.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.606
THE BABY NEEDS
HIS FATHER, TOO.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.608
FINE, BUT IF YOU CAN'T STOP
MISSING YOUR HUSBAND

20:18.782 --> 20:20.393
LONG ENOUGH TO SEE
THE BIGGER PICTURE--

20:20.567 --> 20:22.438
THERE IS
NO BIGGER PICTURE
THAN MY FAMILY.

20:22.612 --> 20:24.571
WELL, THEN, PAY ATTENTION,
BECAUSE THE WORLD
I GREW UP IN,

20:24.745 --> 20:26.181
FAMILIES HARDLY EXISTED.

20:26.355 --> 20:27.704
I NEVER HAD A CHANCE
TO KNOW MINE.

20:27.878 --> 20:28.662
NOT MY FAULT.

20:28.836 --> 20:29.706
NOT YET.

20:31.055 --> 20:32.187
IS THAT WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT?

20:32.361 --> 20:33.841
YOU BLAME US FOR
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

20:34.015 --> 20:35.930
I JUST WANT YOU
TO GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME.

20:36.104 --> 20:37.888
USE YOUR POWER OF THREE.

20:38.062 --> 20:40.021
USE YOUR POWER AS GODS.

20:40.195 --> 20:41.805
SAVE THE WORLD
FROM GOING TO HELL.

20:43.067 --> 20:44.243
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,

20:44.417 --> 20:45.461
THEN I WILL SAY IT
ONE MORE TIME,

20:45.635 --> 20:46.723
AND MAYBE
YOU WILL HEAR ME.

20:46.897 --> 20:48.769
WE NEED LEO.

20:48.943 --> 20:51.511
NOW, EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE TO GO
WARM UP A BOTTLE.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.697

21:03.871 --> 21:05.829
DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL COME
TO TRUST ME IN TIME.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.398
THEY ALL WILL.

21:19.887 --> 21:22.193
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE GONNA EXPOSE US.

21:22.368 --> 21:23.673
SHH. THAT'S THE IDEA.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.719
DID YOU SENSE THAT?

21:25.893 --> 21:27.721
SOMEONE ORBED.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.636

21:34.336 --> 21:35.642

21:48.785 --> 21:51.788
LEO, HOW COULD
YOU LEAVE US?

21:51.962 --> 21:55.575
[ORBING]

21:55.749 --> 21:56.663
WHO ARE YOU?

21:58.926 --> 22:00.057
HI, PIPER.

22:00.231 --> 22:01.494
YOU'RE HOME.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.196
YOU HEARD MY CALLS, RIGHT?

22:08.370 --> 22:09.632
OF COURSE I DID, HONEY.

22:09.806 --> 22:11.286
BUT I HAD TO MAKE SURE
THE ELDERS WERE SAFE,

22:11.460 --> 22:13.201
AND THEN I WAS CORNERED
BY THE TITANS.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.289
I'M JUST THANKFUL
YOU'RE OK.

22:14.463 --> 22:16.117
MY MIND WAS JUST RACING.

22:16.291 --> 22:18.249
I KNOW. I FELT IT.

22:19.425 --> 22:20.817
GOOD THING CHRIS
CAME WHEN HE DID.

22:20.991 --> 22:22.253
CHRIS?

22:22.428 --> 22:24.604
HE DISTRACTED THE TITANS
SO I COULD ESCAPE.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.823
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE
PROBABLY FOLLOWING
HIS ORB TRAIL,

22:26.997 --> 22:29.217
SO WE DON'T HAVE...

22:29.391 --> 22:30.349
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR HAIR?

22:30.523 --> 22:31.437
WHAT?

22:31.611 --> 22:34.048
UM, IT'S WHITE.

22:34.222 --> 22:35.571
IS IT?

22:39.923 --> 22:42.796
WOW. MUST BE
FROM STAYING UP THERE
FOR SO LONG.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.580
I GUESS SO.

22:44.754 --> 22:46.016
WHERE ARE YOUR SISTERS?

22:46.190 --> 22:47.278
WELL, THEY CAN
WAIT A MINUTE

22:47.453 --> 22:48.715
WHILE WE SPEND
SOME TIME ALONE,

22:48.889 --> 22:50.630
AND THEN YOU NEED
TO HOLD YOUR SON.

22:50.804 --> 22:53.284
SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE
EARTH GODDESS.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.374
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

22:55.548 --> 22:57.071
YOU NEED TO CHANNEL
YOUR HEARTH AND HOME
INSTINCTS

22:57.245 --> 22:58.377
TO FIGHT THE TITANS.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.030
LEO, I WAS SPEAKING
FROM THE HEART,

23:00.204 --> 23:01.205
NOT THE HEARTH.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.817
HI. I'M YOUR WIFE.
REMEMBER?

23:03.991 --> 23:07.298
I DO. BUT CHRIS CAN ONLY
THROW OFF THE TITANS
FOR SO LONG.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.952
WE NEED TO BE READY
WITH A BATTLE PLAN.

23:09.126 --> 23:10.780
NOW, LET'S FIND
YOUR SISTERS.

23:14.218 --> 23:16.786
MA'AM, I WAS JUST COMING
TO CHECK ON THE BABY.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.701
THAT'S OK, 'CAUSE HE'S
ACTUALLY SLEEPING,

23:18.875 --> 23:19.876
SO...

23:21.965 --> 23:23.314
WELCOME...

23:23.489 --> 23:24.838
WISE ONE.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.450
OH, NO,
THIS IS JUST MY HUSBAND.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.409
HE'S NOT AN ELDER.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.585
HE'S JUST WEARING
THIS ROBE BECAUSE--

23:32.759 --> 23:34.369
WHY ARE YOU
WEARING THIS ROBE?

23:34.543 --> 23:36.632
OH, IT WAS WINDY
UP THERE.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.112
SEE? SO YOU CAN
TAKE A BREAK,

23:38.286 --> 23:40.331
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
WYATT'S ASLEEP, AND...

23:43.639 --> 23:44.901
OK. HERE WE GO.

23:50.298 --> 23:53.214
IT SAYS IN HERE
THAT CRONUS SWALLOWED
HIS NEWBORN CHILDREN

23:53.388 --> 23:56.347
TO KEEP THEM
FROM OVERTHROWING HIM.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.915
WHAT IF YOU LURE
THE TITANS
TO A FIELD,

23:59.089 --> 24:01.048
PIPER LIFTS THEM
WITH A TORNADO,

24:01.222 --> 24:02.919
AND I HIT 'EM
WITH MY LIGHTNING?

24:03.093 --> 24:04.878
I'M AFRAID THERE'S
NO WAY TO BEAT A MAN

24:05.052 --> 24:06.053
WHO EATS
HIS OWN CHILDREN.

24:06.227 --> 24:06.706
THOSE STORIES
ARE FABLES.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.142
LEO!

24:08.316 --> 24:10.318
WELCOME HOME,
LEO.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.711
WHAT DO YOU
HAVE FOR ME?

24:11.885 --> 24:14.061
PAIGE RAN EVERY
BATTLE PLAN SHE KNOWS,

24:14.235 --> 24:15.628
WHICH, AS A WAR GODDESS,

24:15.802 --> 24:18.979
IS BASICALLY EVERY BATTLE
THAT'S EVER BEEN FOUGHT.

24:19.153 --> 24:21.503
NO MATTER
HOW YOU SPIN IT--

24:21.677 --> 24:24.985
WARRIOR, SEDUCTRESS,
EARTH MOTHER--

24:25.159 --> 24:26.987
WE DON'T HAVE
THE POWER TO DEFEAT
THE TITANS.

24:27.161 --> 24:28.031
WE CAN'T BEAT THEM.

24:28.205 --> 24:29.990
THEY'RE TOO STRONG FOR US.

24:30.164 --> 24:31.818
SEE HOW MUCH
THIS FAMILY
NEEDS YOU?

24:31.992 --> 24:34.342
NO...

24:34.516 --> 24:36.344
I DON'T.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.389
YOU CAN DO THIS
WITHOUT ME.

24:38.564 --> 24:41.175
AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE
YOU HAVE THE POWER OF GODS

24:41.349 --> 24:42.481
OR THE POWER OF THREE.

24:43.525 --> 24:44.874
IT'S BECAUSE...

24:45.048 --> 24:46.789
YOU WERE THE GREATEST FORCE
OF GOOD THAT I KNOW,

24:46.963 --> 24:48.661
AND THAT'S WHY I CHOSE YOU.

24:48.835 --> 24:52.316
OOH, SEE? I COULD
JUST FEEL THE CONFIDENCE
WASH ALL OVER ME.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.492
HE'S DOING IT.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.015
WHAT IS HE DOING?

24:55.189 --> 24:56.930
PAIGE, YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE TO FIND THE POWER

24:57.104 --> 24:58.061
TO CONQUER THE TITANS.

24:58.235 --> 24:59.410
I DO?

24:59.585 --> 25:00.934
YES.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.413
YOU JUST NEED TO FOCUS.

25:05.852 --> 25:09.203
WE HAVE TO DECLARE
OURSELVES GODS.

25:09.377 --> 25:10.552
THAT'S HOW
THE ANCIENT GREEKS DID IT.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.772
CHRIS TOLD US
NOT TO DO THAT.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.208
WELL, CHRIS IS WRONG.

25:14.382 --> 25:15.731
HE DOESN'T
KNOW YOU LIKE I DO.

25:15.905 --> 25:18.299
BUT, LEO, THE ANCIENT GREEKS
LOST THEIR HUMANITY.

25:18.473 --> 25:20.954
YOU'RE NOT
THE ANCIENT GREEKS.

25:21.128 --> 25:22.433
YOU'RE THE CHARMED ONES.

YOU CAN'T HANDLE.

25:32.095 --> 25:33.488
AND YOU CAME BACK.

25:33.662 --> 25:37.144
OF COURSE YOU CAN HANDLE
BEING THE GODDESS OF LOVE.

25:37.318 --> 25:38.754
I NEVER THOUGHT
OF IT THAT WAY.

25:38.928 --> 25:40.277
PAIGE, YOU'RE
THE GODDESS OF WAR

25:40.451 --> 25:42.323
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN CONSUMED
WITH GAINING POWER,

THE POWER CONSUME YOU.

NEED TO ASK THAT?

FROM YOUR EMOTION,
