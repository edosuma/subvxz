This is Love Island:
The Weekly Hotlist.

00:15.960 --> 00:19.959
Your Saturday night fix
of exclusive unseen bits...

00:19.960 --> 00:21.959
<font color="#FFFF00">We just want to cuddle!</font>

00:21.960 --> 00:25.959
..from the villa
everyone wants a piece of.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.959
Talking of unseen bits...
<font color="#00FFFF">Educate me.</font>

00:27.960 --> 00:31.959
..may I just say the swimwear
this year has been second to none.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.959
<font color="#11FF11">Big dog in yellow shorts.</font>

00:33.960 --> 00:36.959
We will be revisiting
all the juiciest moments

00:36.960 --> 00:38.959
from the last seven days.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.959
<font color="#FFFF00">You make me giggle.</font>

00:40.960 --> 00:45.959
All summed up by me. You know, the
voice of that BAFTA Award-winning
show.

00:45.960 --> 00:49.959
Did anyone mention the BAFTA?
<font color="#00FFFF">ALL: Yes!</font> BAFTA.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.959
<font color="#11FF11">Don't push it.</font>

00:51.960 --> 00:55.959
We will be bringing you the most
memorable bits... <font color="#FFFF00">Hey!</font>

00:55.960 --> 00:59.639
..the funniest bits... <font color="#00FFFF">Vocabulary.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">(SLURS) Vocabulary.</font>

00:59.640 --> 01:02.960
..the most awkward bits...
<font color="#FFFF00">If you fancy Alex, step forward.</font>

01:04.319 --> 01:07.959
..and a bucketload of exclusives.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.959
<font color="#11FF11">I feel like a gangster,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I feel like a rapper.</font>

01:09.960 --> 01:12.959
So settle down,
slap on some factor 50,

01:12.960 --> 01:16.959
because things are about
to get hot... list.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.959
See what I did there?

01:18.960 --> 01:20.960
<font color="#FFFF00">(LAUGHS) It's brilliant!</font>

01:34.960 --> 01:38.959
Hello! Welcome to a cherry-popping
first episode

01:38.960 --> 01:40.959
of your Weekly Hotlist.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.959
And to get us in the mood,
let's kick things off

01:43.960 --> 01:46.960
with a quick nose around
TV's raunchiest holiday ranch.

01:47.960 --> 01:52.319
As well as having a great voice,
I am also a dab hand at DIY.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.999
And I think you will be pretty
impressed with what I've done to the
place.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.159
I have repainted the entire villa.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.319
I have even changed the bed sheets.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.479
I am not an animal.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.959
And in an act of
interior design madness,

02:04.960 --> 02:07.959
I covered an entire wall
with fake grass.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.959
But don't worry,
I kept some things the same.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.959
Vanity Corner is still there,
to ensure that after eight weeks

02:13.960 --> 02:17.959
our islanders haven't morphed
into professional darts players.

02:17.960 --> 02:22.959
And the infinity pool is still there
and seems to go on for, well,
infinity.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.959
Hold on a minute.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.959
There was one brand-spanking-new
feature,

02:27.960 --> 02:29.959
the surprise everybody
has been waiting for.

02:29.960 --> 02:33.959
Guaranteed to put the "love"
into Love Island,

02:33.960 --> 02:35.960
a swinging seat.

02:36.960 --> 02:40.959
But that seat won't be swinging
at all without some bums on it.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.959
So let's take a lovely trip
down memory lane

02:42.960 --> 02:45.959
and relive the moment when our girls
entered the villa.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.999
What a treat!

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my gosh, hi.</font>

02:51.960 --> 02:53.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm Samira, nice to meet you.</font>

02:55.960 --> 02:59.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm Samira, I'm 22, from London,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I'm a musical theatre performer.</font>

03:00.960 --> 03:03.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I am a boy-crazy girl.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I do love a bit of a flirt.</font>

03:04.960 --> 03:08.479
<font color="#FFFF00">My perfect guy would have dark hair,</font>

03:08.480 --> 03:10.959
<font color="#FFFF00">that smouldering look,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a nice base tan.</font>

03:10.960 --> 03:12.999
<font color="#FFFF00">Mm! (LAUGHS)</font>

03:13.000 --> 03:15.959
I love the smell of base tan!

03:15.960 --> 03:17.960
<font color="#00FFFF">We are gonna have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the summer of our lives!</font>

03:22.320 --> 03:25.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm Hayley Hughes, I'm 21,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and I'm a model from Liverpool.</font>

03:25.960 --> 03:28.960
<font color="#00FFFF">The biggest word</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I've ever used is...</font>

03:30.960 --> 03:33.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't really know.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't really use big words.</font>

03:34.960 --> 03:36.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I have only slept with one person.</font>

03:36.960 --> 03:39.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Nowadays, girls have slept</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with loads, haven't they?</font>

03:39.960 --> 03:41.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Maybe I just need to experience</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a bit more.</font>

03:44.960 --> 03:47.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, it's unreal.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't get over it.</font>

03:49.160 --> 03:51.160
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh!</font>

03:52.320 --> 03:54.320
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, my God.</font>

03:56.960 --> 04:00.960
<font color="#11FF11">I'm Kendall, I'm 26</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and I'm from sunny Blackpool.</font>

04:04.960 --> 04:08.479
<font color="#11FF11">I have been single for seven months,</font>

04:08.480 --> 04:12.959
<font color="#11FF11">due to my ex-fiance of five years</font>
<font color="#11FF11">leaving me last year.</font>

04:12.960 --> 04:16.639
<font color="#11FF11">Being out of the dating game,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">there is so much to learn.</font>

04:16.640 --> 04:18.959
<font color="#11FF11">So I am open to anything.</font>

04:18.959 --> 04:22.959
Ooh, aye! <font color="#11FF11">That's awful. No, I'm not</font>
<font color="#11FF11">open to anything.</font>

04:22.960 --> 04:24.959
<font color="#11FF11">But you know what I mean.</font>

04:24.960 --> 04:26.959
Gotcha.
<font color="#00FFFF">What's your type?</font>

04:26.960 --> 04:29.959
<font color="#11FF11">Ooh, I go for tall, dark</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and handsome.</font>

04:29.960 --> 04:31.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Every girl says that.</font>

04:32.960 --> 04:34.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Whoo, whoo, whoo!</font>

04:40.960 --> 04:44.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm Dani, I'm 21, I'm from Essex,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I work as a barmaid.</font>

04:44.960 --> 04:47.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I have been single now</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for nearly two years.</font>

04:47.960 --> 04:51.959
<font color="#FFFF00">My dad is happy now</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that I'm on Love Island.</font>

04:51.960 --> 04:54.959
<font color="#FFFF00">When I first told him,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he wasn't, like, ecstatic.</font>

04:54.960 --> 04:57.999
<font color="#FFFF00">I have got to find a boyfriend.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, I am ready for love.</font>

04:58.000 --> 05:01.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, he's going to have to live</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with it.</font> Rather you tell him than
me!

05:01.960 --> 05:05.959
<font color="#11FF11">How are you?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm shaking.</font>

05:05.960 --> 05:07.959
<font color="#FFFF00">What's your name?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Kendall.</font>

05:07.960 --> 05:09.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Like Kendall Jenner!</font>

05:09.960 --> 05:11.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Hello!</font>

05:11.960 --> 05:13.959
(GIRLS CHEER)

05:13.960 --> 05:15.960
<font color="#11FF11">Another girl, another girl.</font>

05:18.960 --> 05:22.640
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm Laura, and I'm an air hostess</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">from Scotland.</font>

05:24.960 --> 05:27.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, I am a fully-fledged member</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of the mile-high club.</font>

05:27.960 --> 05:30.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Like, welcome, everyone, join me.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">(LAUGHS)</font>

05:31.960 --> 05:33.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I have been single</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for about three months.</font>

05:33.960 --> 05:35.959
<font color="#00FFFF">All my friends make fun of me.</font>

05:35.960 --> 05:38.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I've literally had</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">about nine boyfriends.</font>

05:38.960 --> 05:40.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Find me a husband, please.</font>

05:40.960 --> 05:42.960
OK. Leave it with me.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.959
So with the girls hot to trot,

05:46.960 --> 05:49.959
and with a few plastic glasses
of Cava in them,

05:49.960 --> 05:52.960
they were ready to get their teeth
into some fellas.

05:53.960 --> 05:56.959
And who better to lure in
some luscious lads

05:56.960 --> 06:01.959
than a woman who attracts fit men
like my bins attract bluebottles?

06:01.960 --> 06:03.959
Caroline!

06:03.960 --> 06:07.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Are we ready to meet our first boy?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">ALL: Yes!</font>

06:13.960 --> 06:16.960
<font color="#11FF11">I am Niall, I'm 23,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and I'm a student from Coventry.</font>

06:17.960 --> 06:22.959
<font color="#11FF11">I love Harry Potter. I have got</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Hermione Granger's wand tattooed on</font>
<font color="#11FF11">my forearm.</font>

06:22.960 --> 06:26.959
<font color="#11FF11">If a girl is lucky, after a night</font>
<font color="#11FF11">out, she can come back and see my</font>
<font color="#11FF11">wand. (LAUGHS)</font>

06:26.960 --> 06:29.319
<font color="#11FF11">When a girl sees me,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">they probably think</font>

06:29.320 --> 06:31.959
<font color="#11FF11">I am just the typical,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">low-cut, muscle-fit lad.</font>

06:31.960 --> 06:35.639
<font color="#11FF11">Once they get to know me, hopefully</font>
<font color="#11FF11">they will get to realise</font>

06:35.640 --> 06:37.959
<font color="#11FF11">I've got loads of layers. A bit like</font>
<font color="#11FF11">an onion.</font>

06:37.960 --> 06:40.159
Let's hope you don't smell like one,
pal.

06:40.160 --> 06:43.960
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, girls. If you like the look of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Niall, then please step forward.</font>

06:47.960 --> 06:49.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Hayley, why did you not step</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">forward?</font>

06:49.960 --> 06:52.959
<font color="#00FFFF">He seems a nice guy,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">but he's just not my type.</font>

06:52.960 --> 06:55.959
<font color="#11FF11">I'm more of an investment</font>
<font color="#11FF11">for the future.</font> (LAUGHTER)

06:55.960 --> 06:58.959
<font color="#11FF11">Give me about four years,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">obviously, then, sorted, isn't it?</font>

06:58.960 --> 07:00.959
Five years?

07:00.960 --> 07:05.640
You have got eight weeks to work your
magic, like everyone else.
Including this guy.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm Alex, I'm 27.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm an A&amp;E doctor from Carmarthen.</font>

07:10.960 --> 07:14.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I am five hours into a pretty busy</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">A&amp;E shift.</font>

07:14.960 --> 07:16.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Life as a doctor is very fast-paced.</font>

07:16.960 --> 07:20.799
<font color="#00FFFF">A&amp;E is definitely going to be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">very different to Love Island.</font>

07:20.800 --> 07:23.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm always on standby, though,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to mend any broken hearts.</font>

07:23.960 --> 07:27.159
<font color="#00FFFF">Obviously, my bedside manner</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is quite professional at work.</font>

07:27.160 --> 07:29.639
<font color="#00FFFF">But my bedside manner out of</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">work...?</font>

07:29.640 --> 07:32.959
Come on, girls, it's your chance
to bag a doctor!

07:32.960 --> 07:36.999
<font color="#FFFF00">Girls, if you fancy Alex,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">please step forward.</font>

07:37.000 --> 07:39.959
(BLEEPING)
Anyone?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.959
Please?

07:41.960 --> 07:43.959
No?

07:43.960 --> 07:45.959
Oh, kill me now.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Argh!</font>
(HEART RATE MONITOR FLATLINES)

07:47.960 --> 07:52.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Alex, it doesn't matter. Which girl</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">would you like to couple up with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">today?</font>

07:52.480 --> 07:54.639
<font color="#00FFFF">I'll start on the end, yeah?</font>

07:54.640 --> 07:57.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Yay, Laura!</font> Just keep mentioning
you're a doctor, mate.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.959
A girl loves a guy with brains.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.000
Talking of which...
<font color="#FFFF00">This is Wes.</font>

08:03.800 --> 08:05.800
<font color="#00FFFF">Whoa.</font>

08:08.960 --> 08:11.959
<font color="#11FF11">I am Wes, I'm 20 years old</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and I'm a design engineer</font>

08:11.960 --> 08:13.960
<font color="#11FF11">in the electrical and nuclear</font>
<font color="#11FF11">industry.</font>

08:15.960 --> 08:18.959
<font color="#11FF11">Obviously, my job role</font>
<font color="#11FF11">is a massive help</font>

08:18.960 --> 08:20.959
<font color="#11FF11">when you are trying to graft girls.</font>

08:20.960 --> 08:23.799
<font color="#11FF11">They instantaneously think</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm intelligent.</font>

08:23.800 --> 08:25.959
<font color="#11FF11">I could definitely engineer the ride</font>
<font color="#11FF11">of someone's life.</font>

08:25.960 --> 08:28.479
<font color="#11FF11">I've got the gears, I've got the</font>
<font color="#11FF11">gear stick to do it.</font>

08:28.480 --> 08:30.639
<font color="#11FF11">I just thought of that on the spot.</font>

08:30.640 --> 08:33.479
With a quick wit like that,
the next eight weeks will fly by.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.960
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, ladies, if you like the look of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Wes, step forward.</font>

08:38.960 --> 08:43.958
Laura is going to be crueller to a
junior doctor than the Health
Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

08:43.960 --> 08:47.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Why have you stepped forward? Why</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have you left dear old Alex behind?</font>

08:47.960 --> 08:50.959
<font color="#00FFFF">He has got, like, a 20 pack.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm gonna have to stick with Laura.</font>

08:50.960 --> 08:52.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Congratulations.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Sorry, man.</font>

08:52.960 --> 08:55.959
With Dr Alex left firmly
in the waiting room,

08:55.960 --> 08:57.959
it was time to send in
the next patient.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.959
And it was a healthy specimen.

08:59.960 --> 09:02.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Everybody, meet Eyal.</font>

09:04.000 --> 09:06.159
<font color="#00FFFF">Hello!</font>

09:06.160 --> 09:09.960
Did someone say
"curly hair, don't care"?

09:12.800 --> 09:16.160
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm Eyal, I'm 22, I'm from London</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and I'm a model.</font>

09:17.320 --> 09:19.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I like to think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not your typical model.</font>

09:19.960 --> 09:21.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm quite a spiritual person.</font>

09:23.000 --> 09:26.159
<font color="#00FFFF">I have got to have someone</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that has some depth to them.</font>

09:26.160 --> 09:29.999
<font color="#00FFFF">And I also like someone that likes</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to have fun in the bedroom.</font>

09:30.000 --> 09:32.159

<font color="#FFFF00">So, girls, if you fancy Eyal,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">step forward.</font>

09:43.960 --> 09:45.959
I hope Alex missed that.

09:45.960 --> 09:50.959
The remaining girls didn't so much
step forward, as lunge.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.960
Take your pick, Eyal.
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm going with Hayley.</font>

09:53.960 --> 09:56.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Wow, congratulations.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Thanks.</font>

09:58.960 --> 10:00.960
They would make beautiful babies.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.959
Send in the next one, Caroline!

10:03.960 --> 10:06.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Everybody, meet Jack.</font>

10:11.960 --> 10:15.960
<font color="#11FF11">I'm Jack, I'm 26</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and I sell pens for a living.</font>

10:16.960 --> 10:19.959
<font color="#11FF11">I 100% have got the gift of the gab.</font>

10:19.960 --> 10:22.959
<font color="#11FF11">Hello, Julie, it's only</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Jack calling. How are you?</font>

10:22.960 --> 10:25.959
<font color="#11FF11">All the better now I've spoken to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you. In with a joke, they love it.</font>

10:25.960 --> 10:27.959
<font color="#11FF11">This pen is going to change</font>
<font color="#11FF11">your life.</font>

10:27.960 --> 10:31.959
<font color="#11FF11">You can write in the dark with it</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and it will make you feel good</font>
<font color="#11FF11">about yourself.</font>

10:31.960 --> 10:34.960
<font color="#11FF11">I'll send three down to you.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I make stationery fun.</font>

10:35.960 --> 10:38.799
If there's one thing
the villa is missing,

10:38.800 --> 10:40.959
it's a stationery cupboard.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.319
I think he has been using Tippex
on his teeth, too.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.960
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, girls, if you fancy Jack,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">please step forward.</font>

10:49.960 --> 10:52.959
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, we have got two single girls</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">who stepped forward for you.</font>

10:52.960 --> 10:55.959
<font color="#11FF11">I think Dani is lovely.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I will couple up with Dani.</font>

10:55.960 --> 10:59.159
<font color="#FFFF00">Aw! Congratulations. Off you go.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You all right?</font>

10:59.160 --> 11:01.319
<font color="#00FFFF">Lovely to meet you.</font>

11:01.320 --> 11:03.479
But Samira needn't have worried,

11:03.480 --> 11:06.159
because there was a doctor on hand
to ease the pain.

11:06.160 --> 11:10.639
He just needs to work on
his bedside manner.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.959
So there we have it,
five luscious ladies

11:13.960 --> 11:15.960
paired off with five likely lads...

11:25.960 --> 11:27.959
But as we all know,

11:27.960 --> 11:31.319
this wouldn't be Love Island
without a spanner in the works.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.959
Cue a totally handsome hunk with
a massive spanner in his trunks.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Jesus.</font>

11:36.960 --> 11:38.960
At least I hope that's a spanner.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.959
<font color="#11FF11">There's not much left to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the imagination, really, is there?</font>

11:45.960 --> 11:49.960
<font color="#11FF11">I'm Adam, I'm 22 and I'm a personal</font>
<font color="#11FF11">trainer from Newcastle.</font>

11:50.960 --> 11:54.319
<font color="#11FF11">Three words to describe me</font>
<font color="#11FF11">in the bedroom would be flamboyant,</font>

11:54.320 --> 11:56.320
<font color="#11FF11">fun and quick.</font>

11:57.960 --> 12:00.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Guys, if you are a bit worried,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't blame you.</font>

12:00.800 --> 12:04.959
<font color="#FFFF00">In 24 hours, Adam will be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">coupling up with one of your girls.</font>

12:04.960 --> 12:06.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Hold on, mate!</font>
(LAUGHTER)

12:06.960 --> 12:11.479
But don't worry, guys, it's not like
he's 6'5", dark and incredibly man...

12:11.480 --> 12:13.639
Oh, wait, he is.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.799
(LAUGHTER)

12:15.800 --> 12:17.959
With Abs McGee now firmly
on the scene,

12:17.960 --> 12:20.959
it's time for the couples
to brush up on their pulling skills

12:20.960 --> 12:23.960
with a series-first of our handy
guides...

12:26.960 --> 12:31.959
Grafting technique number one,
explore new depths.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you, like, quite deep?</font>

12:33.960 --> 12:35.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm a deep guy.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">(GIGGLES)</font>

12:36.960 --> 12:38.959
<font color="#11FF11"># Deep, deep down...</font>

12:38.960 --> 12:42.319
<font color="#00FFFF">What's meant to happen will happen.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I love a guy that's deep.</font>

12:42.320 --> 12:45.159
<font color="#00FFFF">I like to think I'm quite</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a spiritual kind of person.</font>

12:45.160 --> 12:48.319
<font color="#00FFFF">I think she's on the same page.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">What does "superficial" mean?</font>

12:48.320 --> 12:52.159
<font color="#00FFFF">Like... (SIGHS) She did completely</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">misinterpret what I said to her.</font>

12:52.160 --> 12:54.319
<font color="#FFFF00">Educate me.</font>

12:54.320 --> 12:57.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't predict my own future,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">but at the same time I think that,</font>

12:57.960 --> 13:01.959
<font color="#00FFFF">if you truly believe in something</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and you put your energies</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">into that something...</font>

13:01.960 --> 13:05.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, I'm a deep guy. But I guess</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not just looking for something</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">deep.</font>

13:05.960 --> 13:08.959
<font color="#FFFF00">There's, like, no, like, coordina...</font>

13:08.960 --> 13:10.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Whatever the word is.</font>

13:10.960 --> 13:13.159
I have no idea
what the word is either.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.319
Grafting technique number two...

13:15.320 --> 13:18.959
<font color="#11FF11">What do you do? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I sell office</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">supplies and stationery.</font>

13:18.960 --> 13:20.959
..go for the sales approach.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.959
<font color="#11FF11">You what? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I sell office supplies and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">stationery.</font>

13:22.960 --> 13:26.959
<font color="#FFFF00"># Keep on moving...</font>

13:26.960 --> 13:28.959
<font color="#11FF11">So you sell pens?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah.</font>

13:28.960 --> 13:31.959
<font color="#11FF11">I mean, he's got stationery, he's</font>
<font color="#11FF11">got pencils, he's got sharpeners.</font>

13:31.960 --> 13:35.999
<font color="#00FFFF">I left school and my stepdad's mate</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">was like, "Do you want to come and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">work for me?"</font>

13:36.000 --> 13:38.959
<font color="#00FFFF">And I went, "Yeah, go on. What's it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">doing?" He went,</font>

13:38.960 --> 13:41.959
<font color="#00FFFF">"We sell stationery." I said, "Shut</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">up, mate. I ain't doing that."</font>

13:41.960 --> 13:43.959
<font color="#11FF11">I just love that you sell pencils</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and pens.</font>

13:43.960 --> 13:48.959
<font color="#11FF11">He's got felt-tip pens. I mean, he's</font>
<font color="#11FF11">offering me the world in, like,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">bloody stationery.</font>

13:48.960 --> 13:51.959
<font color="#11FF11">I'm like, "Whoa!"</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you want some pens and pencils?</font>

13:51.960 --> 13:54.959
<font color="#11FF11">Are you selling me a pen now?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You boring bastard.</font>

13:54.960 --> 13:56.959
Grafting technique number three,

13:56.960 --> 13:58.999
keep your girl on lockdown.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Gonna have to be done.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Do it, boy. We are behind you.</font>

14:02.960 --> 14:05.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Can I have a quick chat? Sorry, I'm</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not, like, trying to interrupt.</font>

14:05.960 --> 14:08.959
<font color="#11FF11">No, no, no. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Do you want to go to the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">roof terrace, just check it out?</font>

14:08.960 --> 14:12.799
As the youngest boy in the villa,
convince them you are all man.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.639
<font color="#00FFFF"># What a man, what a man, what a man</font>
<font color="#00FFFF"># What a mighty good man...</font>

14:15.640 --> 14:18.319
<font color="#11FF11">You are the youngest boy and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I am the oldest girl. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, I know.</font>

14:18.320 --> 14:21.959
<font color="#11FF11">Do you know what I mean, though? For</font>
<font color="#11FF11">me, like, I would not put that</font>
<font color="#11FF11">together.</font>

14:21.960 --> 14:24.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, there's not a lot of guys,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not just of my age</font>

14:24.960 --> 14:28.319
<font color="#FFFF00">but people in their 20s in general,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not got their head screwed on.</font>

14:28.320 --> 14:31.959
<font color="#11FF11">I'm really impressed by you.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">(LAUGHS) What do you mean?</font>

14:31.960 --> 14:33.959
<font color="#11FF11">Your job,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I don't really know much about.</font>

14:33.960 --> 14:36.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't really say much about it.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, really?</font>

14:36.960 --> 14:39.960
<font color="#11FF11">That's also interesting.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">(LAUGHS)</font>

14:40.960 --> 14:44.959
Grafting technique number four,

14:44.960 --> 14:47.959
lay it on thicker than Ed Sheeran's
sunscreen in a heatwave.

14:47.960 --> 14:51.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Are you going to lay it on thick,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">or...? What's your plan?</font>

14:51.480 --> 14:53.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Cos I only know it one way, and it's</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">thick,</font>

14:53.960 --> 14:56.959
<font color="#00FFFF">so I'm interested to know other</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">approaches.</font>

14:56.960 --> 14:59.959
<font color="#FFFF00">He just said, "I don't want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to be with you,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't love you any more."</font>

14:59.960 --> 15:03.799
<font color="#00FFFF">I would just never do that to a girl</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">as stunning as you. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, my God. Shut</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">up.</font>

15:03.800 --> 15:06.159
<font color="#00FFFF">Am I laying it on thick?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">(LAUGHS)</font>

15:06.160 --> 15:10.479
<font color="#00FFFF">Tell me to rein it in.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I can go way too thick too early.</font>

15:10.480 --> 15:12.959
<font color="#11FF11"># Never too much, never too much,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">never too much...</font>

15:12.960 --> 15:16.159
<font color="#00FFFF">The chat's flowing.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm laying it on thick.</font>

15:16.160 --> 15:18.160
<font color="#00FFFF">This is actually well romantic.</font>

15:19.640 --> 15:21.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Don't push it.</font>

15:21.800 --> 15:23.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I think that I do push it.</font>

15:23.960 --> 15:26.959
<font color="#00FFFF">And I think it's going well.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I think she's taking to it.</font>

15:26.960 --> 15:30.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I wouldn't say I'm an eager beaver</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of sorts... </font><font color="#FFFF00"> (LAUGHS)</font>

15:30.960 --> 15:32.999
<font color="#00FFFF">I just lay it out there.</font>

15:33.000 --> 15:35.159
<font color="#11FF11">It's crazy, isn't it?</font>

15:35.160 --> 15:39.319
And finally,
grafting technique number five,

15:39.320 --> 15:41.479
let the girl do all the talking.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.959
<font color="#FFFF00">So, my type is usually like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a pretty boy.</font>

15:43.960 --> 15:46.959
<font color="#FFFF00">But like I said, like,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if I have a connection,</font>

15:46.960 --> 15:49.959
<font color="#FFFF00">then I'm like, I can be with anyone.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you know what I mean?</font>

15:49.960 --> 15:55.959
<font color="#11FF11"># You say it best</font>
<font color="#11FF11">when you say nothing at all...</font>

15:55.960 --> 15:57.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, sometimes I need, like,</font>

15:57.960 --> 16:00.959
<font color="#FFFF00">instead of, like, a forced</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">conversation,</font>

16:00.960 --> 16:03.959
<font color="#FFFF00">I like it to sort of flow. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">yeah. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Do you know what I mean?</font>

16:03.960 --> 16:06.959
<font color="#11FF11"># When you say nothing at all...</font>

16:06.960 --> 16:09.959
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you feel like it's hard to get in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a word, or like...?</font>

16:09.960 --> 16:11.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't really just chat.</font>

16:11.960 --> 16:14.639
<font color="#00FFFF">So I'm still learning how to...</font>

16:14.640 --> 16:16.999
<font color="#FFFF00">You know what you should do? Text.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">(LAUGHS) </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah.</font>

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
I think that just about says it all.

16:20.960 --> 16:25.959
Time for a break now. But here is
something to chew over for a couple
of minutes.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.959
Or seconds,
if you've got teeth like Jack's.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.319
Here is Eyal walking over
to join the boys in the hot tub.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.320
But what happened next?!

16:35.800 --> 16:39.959
One. Do his shorts slip down,
giving us a glimpse of little Eyal?

16:39.960 --> 16:42.999
Two. Does he somersault
into the water?

16:43.000 --> 16:47.959
Or three, does he slip and end up
on Adam's lap?

16:47.960 --> 16:49.960
Find out after the break.

17:01.113 --> 17:03.385
Welcome back to
the Weekly Hotlist.

17:03.387 --> 17:07.386
A digest of the dating dalliances and
debauchery from the last seven days

17:07.387 --> 17:10.386
in Majorca's most luxurious
holiday let.

17:10.387 --> 17:12.386
It might be 11 to a room,

17:12.387 --> 17:15.387
but it does have the most
well-mown walls on the island.

17:18.587 --> 17:22.386
Before the break, we showed you
a clip of Eyal at the hot tub.

17:22.387 --> 17:24.387
But what happened next?!

17:29.387 --> 17:32.386
He slipped and ended up
on Adam's lap.

17:32.387 --> 17:34.386
The lucky sod!

17:34.387 --> 17:38.387
Be careful, Eyal.
Like you, that water is very deep.

17:47.387 --> 17:50.386
Now for another of those
elusive exclusives.

17:50.387 --> 17:52.386
This time, from funnyman Niall.

17:52.387 --> 17:56.387
Here is the moment the villa first
found out about his favourite dish.

17:57.387 --> 18:01.426
<font color="#FFFF00">I like chicken dippers.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">(LAUGHS) I like chicken dippers.</font>

18:01.427 --> 18:05.386
<font color="#FFFF00">It's like my tastebuds</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have never developed.</font>

18:05.387 --> 18:08.386
(LAUGHTER)
<font color="#FFFF00">Honestly. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> From being five.</font>

18:08.387 --> 18:10.586
<font color="#11FF11">So what's the most exotic meal</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you've ever had?</font>

18:10.587 --> 18:12.587
<font color="#FFFF00">Lasagna.</font>

18:13.747 --> 18:15.906
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God.</font>

18:15.907 --> 18:19.386
<font color="#FFFF00">I just don't get it. Like, everyone</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">over-complicates their food.</font>

18:19.387 --> 18:23.386
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, from what point in your life</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">do you go, "Do you know what, like,</font>

18:23.387 --> 18:27.386
<font color="#FFFF00">these fuckin' chicken dippers...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll have an 'alleloli'</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">or alveole..."</font>

18:27.387 --> 18:30.386
<font color="#11FF11">'Alveole', that's...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Whatever it's called.</font>

18:30.387 --> 18:33.066
<font color="#FFFF00">At what point growing up do you go,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">"You know what?</font>

18:33.067 --> 18:36.426
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm going to sack off these lovely</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">chicken dippers and turkey</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">twizzlers,</font>

18:36.427 --> 18:39.386
<font color="#FFFF00">give me a cheese platter."</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">When did that happen?</font>

18:39.387 --> 18:41.386
<font color="#FFFF00">It hasn't for me yet.</font>

18:41.387 --> 18:44.387
That's Niall off Jamie Oliver's
Christmas card list.

18:46.387 --> 18:48.586
(JAMES BOND THEME)

18:48.587 --> 18:51.386
It started when they spied a tall,
dark stranger

18:51.387 --> 18:55.386
taking longer than necessary
to enter the villa,

18:55.387 --> 18:58.386
thanks to the gratuitous use
of slow mode.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.386
<font color="#00FFFF">Boys, girls.</font>

19:00.387 --> 19:05.387
The islanders were introduced to the
man of mystery with the golden eye
and licence to pull.

19:06.387 --> 19:09.386
The name's Collard, Adam Collard.

19:09.387 --> 19:13.386
<font color="#00FFFF">Ask the girls how much they weigh</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and I will bench them. (LAUGHS)</font>

19:13.387 --> 19:16.386
<font color="#11FF11">Adam is a threat.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">He is literally like Action Man.</font>

19:16.387 --> 19:19.386
<font color="#11FF11">Look at the boy, for god's sake.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">What have you put me in here with?</font>

19:19.387 --> 19:23.386
He was given the task of making the
sky fall in for one of our couples.

19:23.387 --> 19:25.386
<font color="#FFFF00">You look a bit worried!</font>

19:25.387 --> 19:29.386
So for your eyes only,
here is Adam's plan of attack.

19:29.387 --> 19:32.386
<font color="#00FFFF">I think the next 24 hours are</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">definitely going to be a lot of fun.</font>

19:32.387 --> 19:34.387
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, for me, anyway.</font>

19:35.387 --> 19:37.387
First up, hone in on your target.

19:39.387 --> 19:42.387
<font color="#00FFFF">Kendall? Is that all right?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, sure.</font>

19:45.387 --> 19:48.387
<font color="#FFFF00">You all right?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, not bad. How are you?</font>

19:52.387 --> 19:56.386
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you want to come and go for a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">little chat? </font><font color="#11FF11"> Yeah, of course.</font>

19:56.387 --> 19:58.387
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, no.</font>

19:59.387 --> 20:02.386
Secondly,
when on a Secret Service mission,

20:02.387 --> 20:04.386
don't crack under interrogation.

20:04.387 --> 20:07.066
<font color="#11FF11">What I wanna know is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">where your head's at.</font>

20:07.067 --> 20:10.386
<font color="#00FFFF">Every single girl in here is, like,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">obviously good looking.</font>

20:10.387 --> 20:13.426
<font color="#00FFFF">So I'm not gonna rule anyone out</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">right now.</font>

20:13.427 --> 20:16.386
<font color="#11FF11">Just keeping your cards</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to your chest?</font>

20:16.387 --> 20:19.387
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, you've got to, haven't you?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You've got to keep your cards.</font>

20:21.387 --> 20:24.386
<font color="#FFFF00">What about you?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, what are you thinking, then?</font>

20:24.387 --> 20:27.386
<font color="#00FFFF">I dunno, you know.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I might need to sleep on it.</font>

20:27.387 --> 20:29.386
<font color="#00FFFF">Sleep on it, see what I think.</font>

20:29.387 --> 20:31.386
<font color="#11FF11">You know, it's up to you.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You've just got to do it.</font>

20:31.387 --> 20:35.386
<font color="#11FF11">So just, yeah, just do whatever you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">want to do. What are you thinking?</font>

20:35.387 --> 20:37.387
<font color="#00FFFF">I really don't know, you know.</font>

20:38.387 --> 20:41.386
Third up, take out the competition.

20:41.387 --> 20:45.386
<font color="#00FFFF">It is what it is. I'm not scared to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">step on anyone's toes, because it's</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the game.</font>

20:45.387 --> 20:47.386
<font color="#00FFFF">It's what you've got to do.</font>

20:47.387 --> 20:49.387
<font color="#11FF11">Uh-oh.</font>

20:50.387 --> 20:53.586
<font color="#FFFF00">Sweet, right, wicked. Yeah.</font>

20:53.587 --> 20:56.387
<font color="#11FF11">How tall are you?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">6'5".</font>

20:57.427 --> 20:59.427
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel sick!</font>

21:02.387 --> 21:04.386
<font color="#11FF11">How are you feeling, darling?</font>

21:04.387 --> 21:08.426
<font color="#00FFFF">I just don't want a big dog in</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">fucking yellow shorts</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to come in and, you know...</font>

21:08.427 --> 21:13.226
<font color="#00FFFF">Obviously, they're fucking</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">getting on over there. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Chirps.</font>

21:13.227 --> 21:15.386
<font color="#FFFF00">Don't be intimidated.</font>

21:15.387 --> 21:19.226
<font color="#00FFFF">I am worried. Imagine a big, fat</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">sledgehammer. That's what he's got.</font>

21:19.227 --> 21:22.386
<font color="#00FFFF">I've got a little fucking pickaxe.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I've just got to chat, chat, chat,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">chat.</font>

21:22.387 --> 21:25.386
<font color="#00FFFF">He can just come in and wallop,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">do you know what I mean?</font>

21:25.387 --> 21:28.386
Remember, you are the man
in the golden shorts.

21:28.387 --> 21:30.747
So do your duty and go in
for the kill.

21:32.387 --> 21:34.906
<font color="#00FFFF">So, the girl I want to couple up</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with is...</font>

21:34.907 --> 21:36.907
<font color="#00FFFF">Kendall.</font>

21:54.907 --> 21:57.386
Time for another exclusive,

21:57.387 --> 22:03.226
in the dressing room Wes is trying to
get inside Laura's blouse, literally.

22:03.227 --> 22:10.746
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you want to take it downstairs</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for me?</font>

22:10.747 --> 22:20.386
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm wearing it.</font>

22:20.387 --> 22:22.386
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel like a gangster.</font>

22:22.387 --> 22:26.386
And just like that he became a style
icon.

22:26.387 --> 22:30.386
What are you saying to this?

22:30.387 --> 22:32.387
<font color="#FFFF00">Give us a twirl.</font>

22:36.387 --> 22:39.386
<font color="#00FFFF">It's sick, I won't lie.</font>

22:39.387 --> 22:43.386
<font color="#00FFFF">You can rock that.</font>

22:43.387 --> 22:50.387
<font color="#FFFF00">That is how you make your exit.</font>

23:03.387 --> 23:12.386
Earlier we saw Adam stealing Niall's
girl.

23:12.387 --> 23:15.386
<font color="#FFFF00">Harry Potter.</font>

23:15.387 --> 23:17.386
<font color="#00FFFF">I get it.</font>

23:17.387 --> 23:22.586
What does a wannabe Wizard do when
he is drawn into a love triangle?

23:22.587 --> 23:33.386
Turn to the powers of magic. Here
is Niall's crash course.

23:33.387 --> 23:38.386
<font color="#FFFF00">Big dog, yellow pant-wearing Adam.</font>

23:38.387 --> 23:42.386
<font color="#FFFF00">I told everyone a lad with 15 abs,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you don't trust him.</font>

23:42.387 --> 23:44.386
<font color="#FFFF00">Who was right? Me.</font>

23:44.387 --> 23:49.386
<font color="#FFFF00">Tell him you know about his dirty</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">chamber of secrets.</font>

23:49.387 --> 23:57.586
<font color="#00FFFF">You have abs and shorts and I have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">chat, you know.</font>

23:57.587 --> 24:08.387
Waste no time
in using your best spell.

24:11.587 --> 24:14.386
<font color="#00FFFF">Worked like a charm.</font>

24:14.387 --> 24:21.386
Lesson three, be open to weird
magic. <font color="#11FF11">If I could merge you together</font>

24:21.387 --> 24:26.386
<font color="#11FF11">but no. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> She wishes my personality</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">was in him which is a bit of a</font>

24:26.387 --> 24:31.386
<font color="#FFFF00">statement. I'm not bad-looking he's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just too good-looking it's weird.</font>

24:31.387 --> 24:33.387
<font color="#FFFF00">He doesn't look real.</font>

24:35.227 --> 24:40.387
Lesson four, walk off in a mood.

24:42.067 --> 24:46.386
Lesson five, instead of a mysterious
cloak, shroud yourself in an

24:46.387 --> 24:50.386
impenetrable open layer. Like an
onion.

24:50.387 --> 24:55.386
<font color="#FFFF00">It was like you said I will</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">put your personality in him.</font>

24:55.387 --> 25:03.386
<font color="#00FFFF">It's not like that. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> One of my layers</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is that I back myself</font>

25:03.387 --> 25:10.226
<font color="#FFFF00">and if you didn't have that coating</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the whole thing could get messed up.</font>

25:10.227 --> 25:13.386
Sorry, onions will do that.

25:13.387 --> 25:17.426
Lesson six, when Big Dog makes your
girl disappear,

25:17.427 --> 25:20.387
turn yourself into a mythical
creature.

25:21.387 --> 25:24.386
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm like the rainbow fish in that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">story.</font>

25:24.387 --> 25:30.386
<font color="#FFFF00">Where there is that fish and it had</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">no cool scales</font>

25:30.387 --> 25:33.386
<font color="#FFFF00">and all of the other fish made fun</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of it</font>

25:33.387 --> 25:38.066
<font color="#FFFF00">and then out of nowhere that fish</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">turned into a rainbow fish.</font>

25:38.067 --> 25:42.386
<font color="#FFFF00">But I feel like I need a pristine</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">female fish</font>

25:42.387 --> 25:45.386
<font color="#FFFF00">to unravel my rainbow colours.</font>

25:45.387 --> 25:48.387
I don't have a clue what you're
talking about, mate.

25:54.387 --> 25:58.386
Time for another pearly-white
exclusive from Jack.

25:58.387 --> 26:02.226
<font color="#00FFFF">You have to watch out for bears</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">here. </font><font color="#11FF11"> We are in Spain.</font>

26:02.227 --> 26:11.386
<font color="#00FFFF">You get wolves in Spain. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Do you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">believe in them still?</font>

26:11.387 --> 26:18.386
<font color="#00FFFF">Wolves aren't fake. </font><font color="#11FF11"> I'm talking</font>
<font color="#11FF11">about humans that turn into wolves.</font>

26:18.387 --> 26:32.387
<font color="#00FFFF">Werewolves you mean. I do believe in</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">them. They must be true.</font>

26:38.387 --> 26:43.387
Don't go anywhere because we will be
back quicker than you can say
gale-force prang.

26:53.907 --> 26:56.386
Welcome back.

26:56.387 --> 27:00.386
Most of us have a string of exes we
never want to see again

27:00.387 --> 27:13.387
but on the Hotlist we show the exes
you do want to see.

27:17.387 --> 27:24.386
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm clumsy with my words, I don't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have a good vocal...</font>

27:24.387 --> 27:27.386
<font color="#FFFF00">(LAUGHING)</font>

27:27.387 --> 27:32.386
<font color="#FFFF00">I should just not talk.</font>

27:32.387 --> 27:34.386
<font color="#00FFFF">Vocabulary.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Vocab...</font>

27:34.387 --> 27:49.386
<font color="#00FFFF">Vo...</font>

27:49.387 --> 27:55.386
<font color="#FFFF00">It's like a tongue tie isn't it?</font>

27:55.387 --> 28:00.907
<font color="#FFFF00">I never pronounce my words right and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that's just me, you know.</font>

27:55.427 --> 28:01.387
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't worry, Hayley, it's bot just</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">boo who pronounces her words</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">wrongly.</font>

28:06.957 --> 28:11.596
Next up, a cautionary tale about the
most feared place in all of Love
Island.

28:11.597 --> 28:17.597
Not the hideaway, but the dreaded
friend zone.

28:18.597 --> 28:25.597
So here to help guide our islanders,
Jack, identifying platonic purgatory.

28:26.596 --> 28:30.069
Here is what to look out for.
Number one.

28:30.071 --> 28:34.390
Be aware of shock revelations about
you that will spin her nut.

28:34.391 --> 28:38.391
<font color="#FFFF00">This boy has cheated on all of his</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">previous girlfriends.</font>

28:41.391 --> 28:43.391
<font color="#FFFF00">Jack.</font>

28:46.591 --> 28:49.751
<font color="#FFFF00">On all of their girlfriends?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I've only had two.</font>

28:52.391 --> 28:58.391
<font color="#FFFF00">His reaction was rubbish. It's only</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">two. I don't care if it's one.</font>

28:59.391 --> 29:05.390
Number two, you know you are in
trouble when the girl starts with a
crying girl chat.

29:05.391 --> 29:12.231
<font color="#FFFF00">I always go for the same boys. You</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">know what I mean?</font>

29:13.591 --> 29:19.391
Number three. Things are looking bad
when even the chat gets fishy.

29:21.391 --> 29:26.391
<font color="#FFFF00">I always go for the same pond and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">soon I'm going to run out of fishes.</font>

29:29.391 --> 29:31.430
<font color="#00FFFF">Are you saying you want to go into</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the lake?</font>

29:31.431 --> 29:34.391
<font color="#FFFF00">Maybe.</font>

29:35.591 --> 29:42.430
Number four, if you found yourself
being given the "It's not you, it's
me" speech,

29:42.431 --> 29:46.391
put yourself in the friend zone
before she can.

29:50.391 --> 29:53.390
<font color="#FFFF00">I think after yesterday, my nut</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">spun,</font>

29:53.391 --> 30:00.390
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought, go to bed, have a sleep</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I woke up and thought we get on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">so well, we should be mates.</font>

30:00.391 --> 30:03.751
<font color="#00FFFF">I think so too. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I'm glad.</font>

30:05.391 --> 30:08.390
And finally number five,

30:08.391 --> 30:12.390
however gutted you are that you were
kicked into the friend zone,

30:12.391 --> 30:15.430
protect her by never letting her know
how you really feel.

30:15.431 --> 30:18.070
What a legend.

30:18.071 --> 30:26.391
<font color="#FFFF00">I sort of brushed it off when</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">really, deep down, I'm gutted about</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it.</font>

30:37.391 --> 30:43.070
Here is another exclusive and you
have been waiting three series for

30:43.071 --> 30:45.071
a five-some in the bedroom.

30:46.391 --> 30:54.391
<font color="#FFFF00">We just want to cuddle.</font>

30:56.391 --> 31:02.390
<font color="#00FFFF"># There were five in the bed and the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">little one said rollover</font>

31:02.391 --> 31:05.430
<font color="#00FFFF"># So they all rolled over and one</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">fell out</font>

31:05.431 --> 31:11.390
<font color="#00FFFF"># There were four in the bed and the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">little one said rollover</font>

31:11.391 --> 31:15.390
<font color="#00FFFF"># So they all rolled over and one</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">fell out</font>

31:15.391 --> 31:22.390
<font color="#00FFFF"># And we want to be together for</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">ever</font>

31:22.391 --> 31:29.390
<font color="#00FFFF"># Without the boys I wouldn't care</font>

31:29.391 --> 31:38.390
<font color="#FFFF00">We have to share our wardrobes. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> No.</font>

31:38.391 --> 31:42.390
<font color="#FFFF00">There's no room. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Laura, you have</font>
<font color="#11FF11">two.</font>

31:42.391 --> 31:45.391
<font color="#00FFFF">I want to keep it that way.</font>

31:46.391 --> 31:50.070
Thankfully they got out of bed to
scrub up for the new islanders.

31:50.071 --> 31:52.071
Sweet of them to make the effort.

31:56.391 --> 32:00.390
<font color="#FFFF00">I can see them.</font>

32:00.391 --> 32:02.390
<font color="#00FFFF">Hello.</font>

32:02.391 --> 32:06.390
To say there was jealousy in the air
is an understatement.

32:06.391 --> 32:08.390
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't like this at all.</font>

32:08.391 --> 32:12.390
<font color="#FFFF00">The boys on the other hand didn't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">seem to be bothered.</font>

32:12.391 --> 32:18.390
<font color="#11FF11">Lovely to meet you, I'm Georgia.</font>

32:18.391 --> 32:22.390
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't watch, I feel like watching</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">my boyfriend cheat on me or</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">something.</font>

32:22.391 --> 32:24.390
<font color="#FFFF00">I am Rosie.</font>

32:24.391 --> 32:28.430
Instead of leaving you to go through
social media like an ex

32:28.431 --> 32:31.391
we will give you an exclusive.

32:32.591 --> 32:37.390
<font color="#FFFF00">I think when I first walk in people</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">will be intimidated by my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">confidence.</font>

32:37.391 --> 32:42.390
<font color="#FFFF00">There is no party without Georgia. I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">was born to flirt really.</font>

32:42.391 --> 32:47.391
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not one to cause arguments for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">no reason I don't think.</font>

32:51.391 --> 32:53.390
<font color="#FFFF00">Perfect girlfriend material.</font>

32:53.391 --> 32:56.390
<font color="#FFFF00">But, I am a handful.</font>

32:56.391 --> 33:00.391
<font color="#FFFF00">I have cheated but I haven't been in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a serious relationship so it doesn't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">count.</font>

33:04.391 --> 33:09.390
<font color="#FFFF00">I go on lots of dates, boys normally</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">come up to me asking to take me out.</font>

33:09.391 --> 33:12.070
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't go out with everyone, I take</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my pick.</font>

33:12.071 --> 33:14.391
<font color="#FFFF00">I get bored after the main course.</font>

33:18.071 --> 33:23.390
<font color="#FFFF00">On Love Island I would love to find</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">someone who has the banter</font>

33:23.391 --> 33:33.070
<font color="#FFFF00">like I have.</font>

33:33.071 --> 33:43.390
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm angry right now.</font>

33:43.391 --> 33:45.390
<font color="#00FFFF">Where are you from?</font>

33:45.391 --> 33:47.391
<font color="#FFFF00">Wales.</font>

33:51.391 --> 33:56.390
<font color="#FFFF00">I like to think I'm quite a classy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">girl. I'm feisty when people push my</font>

33:56.391 --> 34:01.390
<font color="#FFFF00">buttons. I do like the finer things</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in life, I'm a self-confessed</font>

34:01.391 --> 34:09.391
<font color="#FFFF00">princess. I like handbags and shoes,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my biggest passion for sure.</font>

34:10.391 --> 34:14.389
<font color="#FFFF00">I've had a pretty messy dating</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">history, I never seem to be the one.</font>

34:14.391 --> 34:19.389
<font color="#FFFF00">I spend a lot of my time looking for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">love, Mr Right. But obviously it</font>

34:19.391 --> 34:22.391
<font color="#FFFF00">has not worked so far.</font>

34:25.231 --> 34:28.389
<font color="#FFFF00">I like to think that by going on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Love Island someone see me 24 hours</font>

34:28.391 --> 34:33.389
<font color="#FFFF00">a day, the good, the bad and the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">ugly and they will hopefully still</font>

34:33.391 --> 34:35.391
<font color="#FFFF00">like me. Who knows?</font>

34:37.391 --> 34:39.389
<font color="#FFFF00">I would say deep down I'm a romantic</font>

34:39.391 --> 34:44.431
<font color="#FFFF00">but then I have been known to cringe</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if someone is a bit too cheesy with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">me.</font>

34:47.431 --> 34:50.389
<font color="#FFFF00">I hope to think that when I walk in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the villa</font>

34:50.391 --> 34:53.391
<font color="#FFFF00">the boys think here comes a little</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Welsh wonder.</font>

34:57.391 --> 34:59.391
<font color="#11FF11">Cheers, everyone.</font>

35:00.391 --> 35:03.430
<font color="#00FFFF">This is horrible. I didn't think I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">would be bothered.</font>

35:03.431 --> 35:06.390
<font color="#FFFF00">I've got the hump.</font>

35:06.391 --> 35:11.390
The new girls sat down with the boys
but before they could get too
comfortable

35:11.391 --> 35:13.390
Georgia went on a date with Niall

35:13.391 --> 35:17.391
and Rosie had less of a date and more
of an appointment with Dr Alex.

35:18.391 --> 35:22.391
Let's cross over to the news desk
for the headlines.

35:25.391 --> 35:28.390
<font color="#FFFF00">With the cowboy hats?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">No, Jolene and that.</font>

35:28.391 --> 35:33.750
<font color="#00FFFF"># Jolene</font>

35:33.751 --> 35:39.390
Rosie is from Wales and so is Alex.
They have so much in common.

35:39.391 --> 35:41.391
(SILENCE)

35:44.391 --> 35:47.230
Niall And Georgia had a kiss.

35:47.231 --> 35:52.750
Alex and Rosie probably shook hands
but we have no witness reports.

35:52.751 --> 35:58.391
The events that unfolded that night
sent shockwaves through the villa.

35:59.391 --> 36:03.390
Hayley remembered the name of the
show she was on.

36:03.391 --> 36:05.910
And proceeded to
show early signs of pie.

36:05.911 --> 36:12.070
<font color="#FFFF00">I know why I'm here so I'm going to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">wait until I get what I want from</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it.</font>

36:12.071 --> 36:14.230
<font color="#00FFFF">That's all I needed to hear.</font>

36:14.231 --> 36:18.390
Adam appears to be losing interest
in Kendall.

36:18.391 --> 36:23.230
<font color="#11FF11">I didn't realise how insecure she</font>
<font color="#11FF11">might have been.</font>

36:23.231 --> 36:26.391
<font color="#11FF11">To be honest it might be grinding on</font>
<font color="#11FF11">us a little bit.</font>

36:27.391 --> 36:33.391
Here are the top stories from
hurricane Rosie/Georgia.

36:34.391 --> 36:37.390
Dani and Hayley negotiate a trade
deal.

36:37.391 --> 36:41.390
<font color="#FFFF00">If you want to get to know Jack,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I am OK with it.</font>

36:41.391 --> 36:43.391
<font color="#00FFFF">I think we just swap.</font>

36:44.911 --> 36:48.590
Which is handy because Hayley
couldn't remember her boy's name.

36:48.591 --> 36:54.391
<font color="#FFFF00">I said if you want to couple up</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with... Umm...</font>

36:56.911 --> 36:59.070
<font color="#FFFF00">What is his name?</font>

36:59.071 --> 37:03.390
And was the recoupling on the
horizon, Eyal kissed Kendall and

37:03.391 --> 37:05.390
Rosie kissed Adam.

37:05.391 --> 37:07.390
Poor Alex.

37:07.391 --> 37:12.231
I'm the guy who does the voice on
Love Island and you have been
watching Island News.

37:17.391 --> 37:20.390
You will be pleased to know it is
exclusive time again. Remember the

37:20.391 --> 37:24.391
game of truth or dare? Here are some
bits you won't have seen.

37:27.391 --> 37:30.390
<font color="#FFFF00">Georgia. Truth or dare.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Dare.</font>

37:30.391 --> 37:34.391
<font color="#FFFF00">I dare you to kiss someone you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fancy.</font>

37:37.391 --> 37:40.430
<font color="#00FFFF">That's easy though.</font>

37:40.431 --> 37:46.390
<font color="#FFFF00">Aw!</font>

37:46.391 --> 37:52.390
<font color="#00FFFF">Adam. Have you ever had a foursome?</font>

37:52.391 --> 37:54.390
<font color="#11FF11">No.</font>

37:54.391 --> 37:56.391
<font color="#FFFF00">If you said a fivesome.</font>

37:57.391 --> 38:00.391
<font color="#11FF11">You are never going to get picked,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">are you?</font>

38:01.391 --> 38:03.390
<font color="#FFFF00">Kendall, truth or dare.</font>

38:03.391 --> 38:05.430
<font color="#00FFFF">Truth.</font>

38:05.431 --> 38:10.391
<font color="#FFFF00">Who is a better kisser, Niall or</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Adam?</font>

38:13.391 --> 38:16.390
<font color="#00FFFF">Adam.</font>

38:16.391 --> 38:19.391
<font color="#FFFF00">Sorry. </font><font color="#11FF11"> He's got more experience</font>
<font color="#11FF11">so...</font>

38:20.391 --> 38:22.390
<font color="#FFFF00">Alex, truth or dare.</font>

38:22.391 --> 38:25.390
<font color="#00FFFF">Truth.</font>

38:25.391 --> 38:30.591
<font color="#FFFF00">If you could couple up with somebody</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">at the end of the week</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">who would it be?</font>

38:32.591 --> 38:34.750
<font color="#11FF11">Anybody.</font>

38:34.751 --> 38:36.751
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know.</font>

38:42.431 --> 38:48.391
<font color="#00FFFF"># You say it best when you say</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">nothing at all</font>

38:50.591 --> 38:55.910
Time for another break but here's
something to mull over whilst the
ad men do their thing.

38:55.911 --> 39:02.391
Here is a clip of the islanders sat
around on bean bags but what happened
next?

39:17.391 --> 39:19.391
Find out in a moment.

39:28.391 --> 39:30.390
Welcome back to The Weekly Hot List.

39:30.391 --> 39:37.231
Your round-up of exclusives from
ITV2's most talked about timeshare.

39:39.911 --> 39:44.390
Remember before the break we saw the
islanders talking on the bean bags?

39:44.391 --> 39:47.391
And here's what happened next.

39:50.391 --> 39:54.390
Niall falls of his beanbag while
getting freaked out by a fly.

39:54.391 --> 39:56.390
Send in the SWAT team.

39:56.391 --> 40:02.390
Exclusive time now and revelations,
Jack did not always sell biros.

40:02.391 --> 40:05.390
Before that there was a different
career.

40:05.391 --> 40:09.230
<font color="#FFFF00">My first job I washed dogs at a dog</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">groomers.</font>

40:09.231 --> 40:12.390
<font color="#FFFF00">I wasn't allowed to cut them.</font>

40:12.391 --> 40:16.390
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you want to come here</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">tomorrow? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> It's a big process.</font>

40:16.391 --> 40:22.390
<font color="#FFFF00">You wash them, then you condition</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">them and they squeeze the water out.</font>

40:22.391 --> 40:27.590
<font color="#FFFF00">Listen. It looks like an oven.</font>

40:27.591 --> 40:35.390
<font color="#FFFF00">They hate it, then I send them to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Diane, she would cut them.</font>

40:35.391 --> 40:44.391
<font color="#FFFF00">She sent some down saying they are</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not dry enough. I promise you.</font>

40:46.391 --> 40:51.070
On to more pressing matters and with
the first recoupling looming,

40:51.071 --> 40:54.390
our islanders couldn't help but ask
that question.

40:54.391 --> 41:03.390
<font color="#00FFFF">Where are you? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I found a rainbow</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fish and I'm like Dumbledore.</font>

41:03.391 --> 41:07.390
I thought you were Harry Potter. <font color="#FFFF00">It's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">brilliant.</font>

41:07.391 --> 41:11.390
Adam is snuffing out Kendall.

41:11.391 --> 41:17.390
<font color="#11FF11">I fancy you the most right</font>
<font color="#11FF11">now but it has ran its course now.</font>

41:17.391 --> 41:20.390
<font color="#11FF11">It's done.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">That's fine.</font>

41:20.391 --> 41:22.750
What was that? <font color="#00FFFF">That's fine.</font>

41:22.751 --> 41:26.390
Got it.

41:26.391 --> 41:29.390
<font color="#FFFF00">Where is your head at? </font><font color="#11FF11"> Where do you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">think it's at?</font>

41:29.391 --> 41:34.391
Adam is close to yours, it's
practically inside.

41:38.391 --> 41:40.390
As for Jack and Dani...

41:40.391 --> 41:47.391
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like me and Jack have grown a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">bit. It was nice.</font>

41:48.391 --> 41:55.750
Jack, is that a pen in your pocket?
It is.

41:55.751 --> 41:58.390
Wes is happier than either of them.

41:58.391 --> 42:02.390
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't stop smiling.</font>

42:02.391 --> 42:07.390
Just when Adam knew where his head
was at, Kendall threw a curve ball.

42:07.391 --> 42:11.390
<font color="#00FFFF">I like you, I would like to get to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">know you.</font>

42:11.391 --> 42:17.390
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know where my head's at</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">because I'm considering both of them</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">as options</font>

42:17.391 --> 42:20.390
<font color="#FFFF00">when it comes to re-coupling.</font>
Make your mind up.

42:20.391 --> 42:26.390
<font color="#11FF11">Which left Hayley realising that she</font>
<font color="#11FF11">did want to know that guy.</font>

42:26.391 --> 42:31.390
<font color="#00FFFF">It lets me know a little</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bit where your head is at.</font>

42:31.391 --> 42:34.390
<font color="#FFFF00">There might be a few surprises.</font>

42:34.391 --> 42:39.390
<font color="#11FF11">I literally don't know what he is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">thinking.</font>

42:39.391 --> 42:43.391
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm slightly in two minds</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about what I'll do.</font>

42:44.391 --> 42:47.390
And so we arrive at the first
re-coupling

42:47.391 --> 42:51.390
and just like Jack and the pen game,
it's a big deal.

42:51.391 --> 42:56.390
Laughing in the face of tradition it
was gentleman picking first which

42:56.391 --> 43:00.390
meant one of the ladies would be
shown the door. First up was Wes

43:00.391 --> 43:04.390
but would he stick with his first
pick?

43:04.391 --> 43:06.390
<font color="#FFFF00">The girl I want to couple up with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is...</font>

43:06.391 --> 43:08.390
<font color="#FFFF00">Laura.</font>

43:08.391 --> 43:10.391
Sensible.

43:15.391 --> 43:20.390
Next up, Love Island's resident
medic, Alex. <font color="#00FFFF">The girl I want to</font>

43:20.391 --> 43:22.391
<font color="#00FFFF">couple up with is Samira.</font>

43:25.391 --> 43:29.390
<font color="#11FF11">Love you, Alex.</font> Jack next.

43:29.391 --> 43:33.390
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to couple up with this girl</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">because I've clicked with her</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">straightaway</font>

43:33.391 --> 43:35.390
<font color="#FFFF00">and I've enjoyed spending time</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with her.</font>

43:35.391 --> 43:38.390
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought I lost her at one point</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but we're back on track.</font>

43:38.391 --> 43:40.390
Who could he be talking about?

43:40.391 --> 43:44.391
<font color="#FFFF00">The girl I want to couple up with is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Dani.</font>

43:54.231 --> 43:58.390
On to Niall. And he was on the
fishing metaphors.

43:58.391 --> 44:04.071
<font color="#11FF11">I caught a rainbow fish. Georgia.</font>

44:06.391 --> 44:12.390
Brace yourselves, we are about
to head into choppy waters.

44:12.391 --> 44:17.390
After his gut told him Hayley wasn't
a good listener, Eyal went and
picked...

44:17.391 --> 44:19.390
<font color="#00FFFF">Hayley.</font>

44:19.391 --> 44:23.070
They do look great together.

44:23.071 --> 44:27.910
Adam had to choose between Rosie and
Kendall.

44:27.911 --> 44:33.390
<font color="#00FFFF">I want to couple up with this girl</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">because I don't really think I gave</font>

44:33.391 --> 44:38.390
<font color="#00FFFF">her enough of a chance. And I do</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">think I should probably get to know</font>

44:38.391 --> 44:49.391
<font color="#00FFFF">her better. So the girl I want to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">couple with is Rosie.</font>

44:52.391 --> 44:54.390
Stay classy, Georgia.

44:54.391 --> 44:59.390
Like a candle in the wind, our lass
from Blackpool had her light turned
out.

44:59.391 --> 45:03.430
<font color="#FFFF00">Making the decision was difficult</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for me.</font>

45:03.431 --> 45:07.390
Tough having to choose between two
beautiful women.

45:07.391 --> 45:12.390
After a strong start that saw her
heart stolen from the arms of a

45:12.391 --> 45:19.390
wizard by a big dog in yellow shorts
Kendall was first out of the villa.

45:19.391 --> 45:23.230
But what will the future bring our
couples?

45:23.231 --> 45:31.390
Will air hostess Laura sign Wes up to
the mile-high club?

45:31.391 --> 45:35.390
Will Dani and Jack meet the parents
because I would pay to see that.

45:35.391 --> 45:42.390
Will Georgia stay on the end of
Niall's rod.

45:42.391 --> 45:45.390
Can Rosie tame big dog Adam.

45:45.391 --> 45:54.390
That is all from this week but
before you go we have time for one

45:54.391 --> 45:59.390
last exclusive. Eyal Having a
spiritual awakening.

45:59.391 --> 46:04.070
<font color="#FFFF00">Hang on, her name is Dani, and his</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">name is Danny Dyer</font>

46:04.071 --> 46:06.431
<font color="#FFFF00">and her name is Dani Dyer.</font>
