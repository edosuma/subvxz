<i>If you fall, you'll be fine...</i>

00:22.880 --> 00:25.848
<i>I will put you back together...</i>

00:25.849 --> 00:30.029
<i>If you thought you're alone ...</i>

00:30.640 --> 00:34.373
<i>Then you couldn't be
more wrong...</i>

00:34.374 --> 00:38.854
<i>If you look to your side...</i>

00:38.855 --> 00:42.540
<i>I'll be there, and we'll
just be fine ...</i>

00:42.541 --> 00:47.363
<i>If you thought you
were wrong...</i>

00:47.364 --> 00:51.119
<i>Well, then we'll carry
you along...</i>

00:55.350 --> 00:57.366
<i>Well, then we'll carry
you along...</i>

01:08.000 --> 01:12.426
<i>If you fall, you'll be fine...</i>

01:14.263 --> 01:16.255

01:16.515 --> 01:21.676

01:22.229 --> 01:24.352
<i>Then you couldn't be
more wrong...</i>

01:24.690 --> 01:30.195
<i>If you look to your side...</i>

01:30.613 --> 01:32.736
<i>I'll be there, and we'll
just be fine ...</i>

01:32.949 --> 01:38.453
<i>If you fall behind...</i>

01:39.372 --> 01:42.408
<i>Well, then we'll carry
you along...</i>

01:45.336 --> 01:48.373
<i>Well, then we'll carry
you along...</i>

01:49.799 --> 01:53.963
<i>Nobody likes a sad song...</i>

01:54.638 --> 01:57.971
<i>Everyone wants a
happy ending...</i>

01:58.100 --> 02:02.263
<i>Nobody likes a sad song...</i>

02:02.813 --> 02:07.190
<i>Everyone wants a
happy ending...</i>

02:12.031 --> 02:12.896
Come on...

02:14.533 --> 02:15.648
Oh, come on!

02:28.965 --> 02:31.800
- Ethan?
- Catie... Where's Suzie?

02:32.260 --> 02:33.374
She's not here.

02:33.636 --> 02:36.388
- I know she doesn't want to see me, but if you just...
- No, Ethan...

02:36.556 --> 02:38.383
...she's really not here.

02:40.185 --> 02:41.180
Catie.

02:42.228 --> 02:43.224
I love her.

02:43.772 --> 02:44.767
Please.

02:45.106 --> 02:48.606
She loves you too, but she has
already left for the airport.

02:53.031 --> 02:55.024
You'll never gonna
make it in time!

03:19.600 --> 03:20.798
Can I help you?

03:24.939 --> 03:26.481
I thought you
were leaving.

03:27.441 --> 03:28.640
I thought I would.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.475
I love you.

03:34.449 --> 03:37.022
You know Suzie, life doesn't give
you a lot of second chances.

03:37.340 --> 03:41.009
And if I've learned anything, I've learned that
you've got to make the most of the moment...

03:41.010 --> 03:41.990
No!

03:44.292 --> 03:46.499
Honey, it just feels
'formulate' to me.

03:46.670 --> 03:49.125
This is the kind of stuff that
happens in every love story...

03:49.256 --> 03:51.925
...but this is not the kind of
stuff that happens in real life.

03:52.134 --> 03:54.755
But it is not real.
It's a... story.

03:54.970 --> 03:58.006
For someone who has never
published anything before...

03:58.515 --> 04:02.430
If you want to break through,
you've got to do something with 'heart'.

04:03.645 --> 04:07.394
Something with sincerity,
something that feels like you really mean it.

04:08.192 --> 04:11.228
Even in a romance,
it has to feel realistic.

04:11.487 --> 04:14.108
That's what I'm trying to do,
draw from real life...

04:14.281 --> 04:16.404
...model the character after my
own experience.

04:16.575 --> 04:18.283
That's another problem.

04:19.245 --> 04:22.281
That's just not the kind
of 'reality' I'm talking about.

04:22.999 --> 04:24.327
Don't get me wrong...

04:26.169 --> 04:28.660
You seems like a
very nice kid.

04:29.088 --> 04:32.789
But for your leading man, even...
you need a 'leading man'!

04:32.967 --> 04:36.668
You need somebody who is
handsome, and confident...

04:36.971 --> 04:39.047
...and charismatic,
and sexy.

04:39.933 --> 04:43.384
No offense. In real life,
girls end up settling for ...

04:43.520 --> 04:47.220
...nice guys all the time but you see,
even this is my point.

04:47.524 --> 04:52.767
This is why they go to the movies and
they need to read the romance novels.

04:52.904 --> 04:55.193
They want to read them
because they want to see...

04:55.365 --> 04:59.114
...girls like them fallin' in love
with guys who aren't like you!

04:59.745 --> 05:04.703
Okay, so, you're telling me you wanted to be realistic,
but 'not' realistic.

05:05.084 --> 05:05.997
Exactly.

05:06.543 --> 05:07.788
I don't understand.

05:08.212 --> 05:10.833
Ethan, your writing
is not bad.

05:11.340 --> 05:13.831
It's pretty good, actually.
It's funny!

05:14.009 --> 05:14.923
Thank you.

05:15.177 --> 05:18.427
It's just not something
we can publish.

05:21.225 --> 05:22.139
Ethan...

05:22.810 --> 05:26.096
I've been watching you coming here for a long time,
trying to make...

05:26.272 --> 05:29.688
...something happen,
and I have to tell you it's just not happening.

05:29.942 --> 05:31.187
I'm very sorry.

05:31.527 --> 05:34.647
Please... There's got to be something else I can do.

05:35.281 --> 05:38.733
Of course, there is so much
stuff that you can do.

05:38.910 --> 05:40.285
You are young...

05:40.578 --> 05:43.414
...and you have the whole future ahead
of you to figure out what to do...

05:43.540 --> 05:47.123
...but just don't...
don't get hung up on writing.

05:49.796 --> 05:52.370
Ethan, I'm so sorry.
I have somebody waiting.

05:54.134 --> 05:55.509
Right, you're... uh...

05:57.930 --> 05:59.472
Thank you for your time.

06:02.101 --> 06:03.096
Hey, Ethan!

06:04.269 --> 06:05.977
You know what I'm
gonna do?

06:06.855 --> 06:09.773
I'm gonna have Allison
validate your parking.

06:09.942 --> 06:10.973
You hold on.

06:11.402 --> 06:14.071
Oh, it's... I didn't drive...
- Allison...

06:14.488 --> 06:18.403
Allison, when this young man comes out,
would you validate his parking, please?

06:36.428 --> 06:38.136
"Our Spry
is doing just that."

06:38.263 --> 06:41.383
"Which means that it
keeps your teeth clean."

06:41.516 --> 06:43.473
"It's sugar but
it's 'not' sugar..."

06:43.643 --> 06:45.221
"And it's good for
your teeth."

06:47.147 --> 06:49.685
"Spry gum.
Stay free, less filling."

06:51.818 --> 06:55.733
"With gum so good,
we don't need a professional spokesman."

06:59.326 --> 07:00.095
Hello!

07:00.244 --> 07:01.157
Hi!

07:01.745 --> 07:04.071
What's it gonna be today?
- Just a black coffee to go.

07:04.915 --> 07:05.745
Anything else?

07:05.874 --> 07:08.412
Yeah! Dinner at my house.
Any Sunday, you name it!

07:08.544 --> 07:10.620
I think I can make that happen.
- Excellent!

07:10.754 --> 07:12.379
You've been playing
hard to get.

07:13.257 --> 07:16.460
Should I bring dessert?
- I wouldn't have invited you, otherwise.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.713
So, eh...
just you there?

07:20.556 --> 07:21.671
...and David.

07:22.016 --> 07:23.807
Well, David is always invited.

07:23.935 --> 07:26.971
I just meant that you could always bring
someone who is not your brother, you know.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.686
Uncle Logan...
- I just say...

07:30.233 --> 07:31.001
Enough.

07:31.067 --> 07:34.436
If don't ask, how am I supposed to know
if there's anyone worth asking about?

07:34.612 --> 07:37.020
When you there is, you'll
be the first to know.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.271
"When" or "if"?

07:39.534 --> 07:40.613
Ouch!

07:40.952 --> 07:42.861
I know it's scary.

07:43.914 --> 07:46.701
But it gets less scary when you
put yourself back out there.

07:46.833 --> 07:49.953
Sooner or later, you'll gonna
have to just take a leap.

07:50.379 --> 07:53.498
'Later' is a lot harder
than 'sooner', believe me.

07:54.299 --> 07:57.253
I know. I just don't
know if I'm ready yet.

07:58.220 --> 08:00.047
You want to know a secret?
- Yeah?

08:00.472 --> 08:04.340
No one... is ever ready.
That's why they called it 'the leap'.

08:05.436 --> 08:08.520
And if you wait 'till you're ready,
you're going to wait forever.

08:10.775 --> 08:11.640
Oops!

08:13.569 --> 08:15.229
Hospital?
- Naturally.

08:17.281 --> 08:19.772
What is the damage?
- On the house. Doctor's discount.

08:19.951 --> 08:21.445
I know you're thinking
about cops.

08:21.577 --> 08:23.736
Doctors actually pay for
their drinks.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.160
Get out of here before
I change my mind!

08:26.749 --> 08:29.038
Call me!
- I will. 'Bye!

08:37.719 --> 08:39.676
Sorry. I didn't mean
to startle you.

08:39.846 --> 08:42.551
No, no, no, that's okay.
I was just writing out some thoughts.

08:43.975 --> 08:45.256
Is that a diary?

08:45.393 --> 08:47.719
No, it's a... journal.

08:48.772 --> 08:50.563
Must be some pretty
deep stuff.

08:50.691 --> 08:51.604
Not really.

08:51.733 --> 08:54.818
Then it must be 'psycho-perverted'.
- What? No, nothing like that.

08:54.945 --> 08:57.187
Well, if it's a journal, it has to be
one or the other.

08:59.616 --> 09:02.701
I'll go with 'deep'.
- That is a good choice.

09:02.828 --> 09:05.117
The world has enough
perverts in it already.

09:23.349 --> 09:24.891
Hi.
- Hi.

09:27.228 --> 09:28.224
So, do I make it?

09:29.105 --> 09:30.434
Did you go make it?

09:30.565 --> 09:31.763
Yeah, in your journal.

09:32.067 --> 09:34.605
How much impact does someone
has to have on your life...

09:34.736 --> 09:37.772
...before you immortalized them
in your personal record?

09:38.031 --> 09:41.863
Eh... well, like I said,
it's just really a bunch of thoughts. It's kinda random.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.652
How much 'random' do I
have to be?

09:44.788 --> 09:46.946
How much more
'random' can you be?

09:48.750 --> 09:52.451
I tell you what? I can...
name a character after you some time.

09:53.964 --> 09:56.918
So, you're really a writer?
Like for a living?

09:57.051 --> 09:59.292
Well, that's what I tell
people to impress them.

09:59.428 --> 10:03.640
No, I'm... I'm really a writer.
I just don't really make a living in it.

10:04.433 --> 10:06.592
Have you ever tried to get published?
- Used to.

10:06.727 --> 10:08.934
Used to get published?
- Used to 'try'.

10:10.022 --> 10:11.220
Until when?

10:11.399 --> 10:13.806
Eh... pretty recently,
actually.

10:18.573 --> 10:19.771
You should keep
trying.

10:20.158 --> 10:22.909
Too late. Gave up...
about an hour ago.

10:23.494 --> 10:24.443
Well, that's a mistake.

10:24.579 --> 10:27.248
I mean, if haven't had any luck,
it is because you're publishing...

10:27.415 --> 10:30.416
...the wrong stuff.
Maybe you should try something new?

10:31.336 --> 10:32.498
Like what?

10:35.298 --> 10:37.789
Hmmm... there's this guy
who walks into a cafe.

10:38.635 --> 10:40.544
He's nice...
but desperate.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.840
Oh! Desperate?
- Yup! He is a total loser.

10:44.808 --> 10:46.765
Ready to give
all up.

10:47.394 --> 10:49.434
But then, he meets
this girl.

10:50.439 --> 10:53.642
The single most amazing woman
he has ever met in his life.

10:55.027 --> 10:56.402
And she inspires him.

10:57.988 --> 11:00.230
Convinces him not to
give up hope.

11:03.786 --> 11:04.865
And then what?

11:06.038 --> 11:06.987
I don't know.

11:07.206 --> 11:09.875
You're the writer.
I just provide the inspiration!

11:10.459 --> 11:11.491
Hey, wait!

11:13.421 --> 11:17.371
If I need some inspiration,
Can I, maybe, call you and get some?

11:20.386 --> 11:24.051
Inspiration, I meant get
some inspiration.

11:25.934 --> 11:28.057
Well... desperate!

11:35.235 --> 11:36.184
Alright.

11:37.487 --> 11:38.317
Okay.

11:40.073 --> 11:41.698
But I just want
to warn you.

11:41.825 --> 11:44.826
I do not inspire well
on an empty stomach.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.613
Okay. Oh, wait,
how is your name?

11:48.916 --> 11:50.030
I'm Jesse.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.167
Jesse...

12:11.898 --> 12:12.763
Excuse me?

12:13.441 --> 12:16.228
Hi, I called an order for pick-up.
My name is Troy.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.185
I go check then.

12:19.656 --> 12:20.687
Thank you.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.573
"How important
is your vision to you?"

12:26.830 --> 12:29.534
"Cataract specialist delay
the guess work."

12:33.962 --> 12:37.497
My brother and I die when that
commercial comes on.

12:37.632 --> 12:38.581
So brilliant!

12:39.092 --> 12:40.088
You think so?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.838
Yeah, don't you?

12:42.846 --> 12:43.925
Well I...

12:44.056 --> 12:44.802
What?

12:44.973 --> 12:48.556
- That's actually my commercial.
- Your commercial?

12:48.727 --> 12:51.479
Well, That's what I do.
I make television commercials.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.644
I don't even know you and
I've already called you brilliant.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.440
Makes me feel slightly better
about being a sell-out...

12:58.571 --> 13:01.026
...devoting my life to consumerism
that suppose to contribute...

13:01.157 --> 13:03.149
...to something actually artistic
to society.

13:03.492 --> 13:06.410
Well, commercials are the 'art'
of today's society.

13:07.538 --> 13:10.907
My mom used to tell me that.
- And I reminded him of his mother.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.491
I think she just thrilled that I'm
not starving after I told her...

13:13.628 --> 13:16.415
...I wanted to be a writer rather than
going to school for a real career.

13:16.547 --> 13:18.457
Well, I'm sure she's
very proud.

13:19.300 --> 13:21.127
She's my mom.
She have to be.

13:21.886 --> 13:23.215
Thank you.
- Sure.

13:25.432 --> 13:28.349
As a general rule, I try
not to be one of these...

13:28.476 --> 13:31.892
...crazy men who ask random girls he meets
in restaurants for their phone numbers.

13:32.689 --> 13:35.145
But I have this strange feeling that if I
don't make an exception this one time...

13:35.317 --> 13:36.645
...I'm really going
to regret it.

13:36.818 --> 13:40.234
See, then, I'll have to come all the way back here,
order this stuff all over again...

13:40.364 --> 13:42.403
Canned food is not very good
here anyway.

13:42.574 --> 13:45.361
On top of everything else,
I have to find some way to strike up a conversation...

13:45.494 --> 13:49.278
...with you and I will have to come
up with some witty clever remarks.

13:49.540 --> 13:52.825
So, you won't think I'm some sort of idiot,
coming all the way back here just to talk to you.

13:53.544 --> 13:58.040
So, the way I see it is...
if you actually gave me your phone number now...

13:59.091 --> 14:01.380
You'll be helping me
out a great deal.

14:02.053 --> 14:04.425
You make it sound like an act of charity on my part.

14:04.555 --> 14:07.093
I don't think there's any other way
you can possibly see it.

14:08.226 --> 14:09.471
Okay, then.

14:17.402 --> 14:19.359
Thank you, Jesse.
- Sure.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.319
You've done
the right thing today.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.072
Okay, 'bye.
- 'Bye.

14:38.465 --> 14:40.374
Hi.
- Hi! I'm looking for Jesse.

14:40.550 --> 14:41.926
Sure.
Come on in.

14:43.220 --> 14:44.251
Thanks.

14:45.973 --> 14:46.886
Wow.

14:47.099 --> 14:49.507
I'm her brother, David.
- Hey, Ethan.

14:52.563 --> 14:54.686
Jess!
Ethan is here!

14:54.857 --> 14:56.399
Okay!
I'll be right out!

15:01.489 --> 15:04.443
I'm sorry, you look familiar
to me. Have we met?

15:04.909 --> 15:07.661
I don't think so. Probably just...
- The 'Gum Guy'!

15:07.829 --> 15:09.287
You are the 'Gum Guy',
right?

15:09.997 --> 15:11.373
That's it, right?

15:12.083 --> 15:13.198
Jesse!

15:13.501 --> 15:14.414
S. ..

15:14.877 --> 15:17.084
Hi!
- Hi. You look great!

15:17.213 --> 15:18.494
Thanks.
Are you ready?

15:18.673 --> 15:21.342
Yeah. You didn't tell me
your brother is a 'big celebrity'.

15:21.843 --> 15:23.385
I didn't want to brag.

15:24.137 --> 15:25.512
'Bye.
- 'Bye.

15:25.680 --> 15:26.676
Nice to meet you.

15:27.057 --> 15:28.551
Nice to meet you,
Ethan.

15:29.142 --> 15:30.471
Have fun!

15:31.019 --> 15:32.348
Stay up late!

15:35.148 --> 15:37.355
Did I ignore your brother?
I mean, I didn't mean to...

15:37.526 --> 15:39.150
No, no, no, he's...

15:39.319 --> 15:42.356
...just had a hard time dealing
with his 'celebrity'.

15:42.489 --> 15:45.490
Those commercials are huge!
He's got to be awesome for an actor.

15:45.617 --> 15:48.784
Yeah, but that's just it.
He is not an 'actor'.

15:49.830 --> 15:51.111
What do you mean?

15:51.415 --> 15:54.665
Well, like three years ago,
Spry chewing gum ran this big promotion...

15:54.794 --> 15:58.494
...where people would win prizes
in packs of gum, right, mostly...

15:58.631 --> 16:04.171
...small stuff like t-shirts,
and baseball hats, and... gum.

16:04.762 --> 16:07.467
And It turns out that Spry
was looking for a regular guy...

16:07.598 --> 16:09.638
...to be their new
spokesperson.

16:10.977 --> 16:13.219
David... was that
regular guy.

16:14.355 --> 16:16.811
Next thing we know,
he signed a contract to be in their commercial...

16:16.983 --> 16:19.984
...for a lifetime supply
of chewing gum.

16:23.114 --> 16:25.136
The only problem was,
my brother...

16:25.137 --> 16:27.159
...doesn't exactly have
what you would call...

16:28.912 --> 16:30.406
...'charisma'.
- Cut!

16:33.417 --> 16:35.705
Spry gum.
With a hundred percent Tylon ...

16:35.877 --> 16:37.870
Xili-xil-xylitol?

16:38.213 --> 16:40.704
With a hundred percent 'Xylitol'.
- With a hundred percent 'Xylitol'.

16:40.841 --> 16:43.047
- Cut!
- Here? Or here?

16:43.177 --> 16:44.920
That's fine. Right there!
- Or here?

16:45.637 --> 16:47.096
Or there?
- That's fine!

16:47.222 --> 16:49.927
It is hard when the words are right there,
and I'm suppose...

16:50.100 --> 16:52.936
...to say, but I'm suppose to look there?
How do I say the words?

16:53.062 --> 16:54.805
Smile!
- I am.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.179
Smile bigger!

16:56.482 --> 16:58.938
Like that?
'Xi-li-tol'!

16:59.235 --> 17:00.433
Spry Gum...

17:00.570 --> 17:02.609
...taste great, less filling..s.

17:03.739 --> 17:07.737
No! No! That's weird!
Smile, smile like a normal person.

17:08.869 --> 17:10.743
I'm pretty sure you
can't actually say that.

17:10.872 --> 17:13.540
That is someone else's slogan.
- Cut!

17:14.166 --> 17:15.116
Spr ...

17:15.251 --> 17:17.492
Do you have something for my ears?
Because my ears are very hot?

17:17.670 --> 17:19.829
Spry gum. It's like...

17:20.632 --> 17:21.580
...mint.

17:21.758 --> 17:24.426
But you chew 'em and they never go away.
- Cut!

17:24.553 --> 17:27.719
I totally thought that he was acting.
But really? That's just him?

17:27.848 --> 17:30.552
He's been on TV non-stop
for the past three years.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.260
And 'YouTube', who knows
how many times.

17:33.395 --> 17:35.886
How long can they run those things?
- As long as they want.

17:36.064 --> 17:38.900
And all he's has to show
for it is free 'Spry'.

17:39.067 --> 17:40.063
Oh, wow!

17:41.028 --> 17:42.403
Wow, that's...

17:42.696 --> 17:45.270
...'true' wow. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be...

17:45.407 --> 17:49.073
No, it's okay.
Pretty much everyone find this funny, but David.

17:56.043 --> 17:58.451
Sorry, looks like this is
gonna take a while.

17:59.964 --> 18:01.127
Eh...

18:02.925 --> 18:04.883
I think I know
a better place!

18:05.178 --> 18:06.553
Oh, okay.

18:07.764 --> 18:09.424
I haven't been here
for a long time.

18:09.599 --> 18:11.888
Are you sure it's okay
for us to be here afterhours?

18:12.018 --> 18:15.304
It's the best time to come.
- Until the SWAT team shows up.

18:17.148 --> 18:18.808
We're not
bothering anyone.

18:21.111 --> 18:24.147
When I was little,
my dad usually bring my brother and I here.

18:24.281 --> 18:26.024
All the time we used
to watch games.

18:26.199 --> 18:27.693
Hmmm... are you close
to your dad?

18:29.327 --> 18:32.447
He died when I was twelve.
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

18:32.914 --> 18:33.994
It's okay.

18:34.499 --> 18:38.200
It was a long time ago.
And yes, we were close.

18:39.254 --> 18:42.955
But I'm just happy I got to spend the
time with him like I did, you know.

18:43.884 --> 18:45.213
And my uncle Logan...

18:45.344 --> 18:48.511
...his brother, kinda stepped in
and became like a second dad.

18:48.639 --> 18:50.430
So that helped a lot.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.928
How about you?
How about your family?

18:57.607 --> 19:00.358
Eh, my parents have been
happily married for 40 years.

19:00.943 --> 19:02.651
Wow!
That's impressive.

19:02.820 --> 19:04.362
Well, they are.

19:05.615 --> 19:08.569
What is their secret?
- Well, beats me.

19:09.369 --> 19:12.239
My dad always said that they fell in
love the first night that they met.

19:13.665 --> 19:16.120
I don't know. Do you think
that's even possible?

19:16.292 --> 19:18.997
I think I felt like that once.
- Really?

19:19.129 --> 19:20.243
What happened?

19:20.422 --> 19:22.414
Well... we dated...

19:23.008 --> 19:25.962
...and then we got engaged.
And then we got married.

19:26.762 --> 19:28.256
And then we got
divorced.

19:30.557 --> 19:34.092
The longer version of the story?
- The long and the short of it, yeah.

19:36.730 --> 19:38.937
So what was it?
Was he just the wrong guy?

19:41.026 --> 19:43.102
I just wasn't the
right girl.

19:43.862 --> 19:45.025
Come on,
I doubt that.

19:45.197 --> 19:48.151
Oh, I know. Shocking, isn't it?
- It is shocking.

19:51.954 --> 19:55.952
Oh... I loved him.

19:59.003 --> 20:01.577
We were married
over three years.

20:03.591 --> 20:04.670
I tried...

20:05.093 --> 20:07.002
I really tried to make
it work.

20:08.096 --> 20:09.175
But?

20:09.389 --> 20:15.601
But... eh... ultimately,
I wasn't what he wanted.

20:21.318 --> 20:23.773
How's that for ruining
our first date?

20:24.654 --> 20:26.030
Not even close.

20:26.198 --> 20:29.697
Once I've got a girl who got back with
her boyfriend through a text message ...

20:29.826 --> 20:31.321
...while we were at dinner.

20:32.287 --> 20:33.450
Oh, oh ...

20:34.081 --> 20:36.786
Yeah, you've got to
work a lot harder to beat that.

20:37.334 --> 20:38.413
Oh... wow!

20:45.885 --> 20:48.340
It's funny how life never turns
out the way you think it will.

20:48.471 --> 20:49.466
Yeah...

20:50.097 --> 20:52.802
When I was a little girl,
I thought I'd be married...

20:52.934 --> 20:54.677
...and have four kids
by now.

20:55.895 --> 20:59.394
Instead I'm divorced and...
don't even have a plant.

21:01.734 --> 21:05.602
Come on, you've got lots of time.
I bet you will be a great mom.

21:07.282 --> 21:09.855
When I was a kid I thought I
would be a Pulitzer Prize winner.

21:10.285 --> 21:13.036
And instead, I spent most
of my days punching toilets.

21:13.872 --> 21:15.200
Hobby of yours?

21:15.790 --> 21:17.830
No, I managed
the building I live in.

21:18.001 --> 21:19.994
Maintenance for
free rent. Can't beat it...

21:20.128 --> 21:22.002
Hmmm... looks like
you're handy.

21:22.756 --> 21:25.294
Never met a radiator
I couldn't handle.

21:25.467 --> 21:27.258
Like twelve when I'm old,
whatever.

21:30.597 --> 21:33.966
So...
no first date regrets?

21:35.185 --> 21:36.561
Absolutely not.

21:37.354 --> 21:38.433
You?

21:39.523 --> 21:41.315
Absolutely not...

21:42.484 --> 21:43.765
...yet.

21:44.069 --> 21:45.149
Great.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.238
Oh! Shit!

21:53.204 --> 21:54.828
Sorry.
- It's okay.

21:58.459 --> 21:59.574
Sorry.

22:30.951 --> 22:32.066
Here we go!

22:33.120 --> 22:34.531
So, this is it...

22:34.705 --> 22:38.655
Yeah, if by 'it' you mean all there is, then,
this is definitely 'it'.

22:40.502 --> 22:42.460
Oh, that's my niece
and nephew.

22:44.465 --> 22:45.544
Sweet!

22:47.718 --> 22:51.763
That, that is just a thing...
it's like a good luck charm.

22:52.390 --> 22:55.474
They say that everything we own
tells a story about who we are.

22:55.643 --> 22:57.470
Yeah? Then, what does
that say?

22:58.563 --> 23:02.395
That you're old school.
This isn't new. It's an original.

23:03.568 --> 23:05.561
Pre-Hayden.

23:05.695 --> 23:09.610
This is Kenner, gonna say
like... 1977.

23:11.701 --> 23:14.073
Okay, that's the hardest thing
a girl ever said to me.

23:14.746 --> 23:17.617
Don't be too impressed.
I have a brother, remember?

23:17.999 --> 23:20.206
- 'My Little Pony' was more of my thing.
- Oh, yeah?

23:20.377 --> 23:22.998
Yeah, and I have a favorite,
'Firefly'.

23:23.130 --> 23:26.166
And she was pink,
with a turquoise mane...

23:26.300 --> 23:30.677
And I brought her with me everywhere.
She was like a security blanket...

23:30.971 --> 23:32.169
Oh, sorry!

23:33.015 --> 23:35.257
You weren't big enough
to actually keep her.

23:35.392 --> 23:38.228
Oh, I would have, but
sadly we lost ...

23:38.354 --> 23:40.596
...'Firefly' on a
family vacation.

23:42.691 --> 23:44.649
I'm sure wherever she is,
she's very happy.

23:44.777 --> 23:47.482
Just as long as she's a
well adjusted adult pony.

23:47.655 --> 23:52.151
Yeah, I'm going to use the little boy's room.
Could I trust you to behave yourself?

23:52.368 --> 23:54.740
No. I'm gonna sniff around
everywhere.

23:54.912 --> 23:55.861
Great.

23:55.997 --> 23:57.906
So, you better hurry.
- Don't worry, I'm dope for speed.

23:58.082 --> 23:59.162
That's hot!

23:59.876 --> 24:04.538
I meant in the bathroom.
That sounds better. I'll be right back.

24:20.939 --> 24:22.137
Okay...

24:29.573 --> 24:30.604
Alright...

24:35.913 --> 24:36.862
Hey!

24:37.289 --> 24:38.155
Hi.

24:42.878 --> 24:45.204
Oh... is this okay?

24:45.381 --> 24:47.457
Yeah, yeah, no,
it's fine.

24:47.592 --> 24:50.083
I just forgot that
I left it out.

24:51.387 --> 24:54.388
It's really good.
- No, really? No.

24:54.557 --> 24:55.506
Really?

24:55.767 --> 24:57.177
Is all your stuff like this?

24:58.019 --> 24:59.299
Eh... some of it.

24:59.479 --> 25:02.017
It's mostly short stories,
really.

25:02.190 --> 25:06.318
And some longer stories. That's a poetry,
a couple of screenplays nothing much.

25:06.444 --> 25:09.611
You know, I really don't
let people read stuff.

25:10.782 --> 25:13.902
You said you tried to get published.
- I said I used to try.

25:14.828 --> 25:19.205
I don't know, I thought that I was going
to make a living doing this, but I...

25:21.293 --> 25:23.914
...discovered that it was
really hard...

25:24.087 --> 25:26.543
...to get people to pay
your rent.

25:32.221 --> 25:34.297
Maybe you just need
some more time.

25:35.891 --> 25:37.089
Maybe.

25:38.519 --> 25:40.310
Or maybe you sucked.

25:41.897 --> 25:43.060
Maybe.

25:48.362 --> 25:50.900
What I've read
seemed really good.

26:17.517 --> 26:19.475
Ehmm... Ugh! Well...

26:21.855 --> 26:22.721
I know.

26:24.650 --> 26:27.686
Oh, it must have been...
some date.

26:28.737 --> 26:30.148
Yeah, it was somethin'.

26:32.449 --> 26:36.578
Are you too sleepy for breakfast?
- Never too sleepy for breakfast.

26:37.163 --> 26:39.701
Good, because it's
'eggs' time!

26:41.000 --> 26:43.158
And I've got some
coffee brewing too.

26:43.961 --> 26:45.835
So, tell me...

26:46.464 --> 26:49.133
Is there any future with this guy?
- Depends.

26:49.509 --> 26:51.051
Depends on what?

26:53.262 --> 26:57.130
Troy! It's good to see you! We've got you at the
back a table if you're going in to dine with her.

26:57.267 --> 26:58.465
Thanks.
- Yeah.

27:02.022 --> 27:03.516
Thanks, Cory.

27:04.232 --> 27:06.024
I take it that you
come here a lot.

27:06.735 --> 27:09.652
Well, I'm a creature of habit.
I work just down the street.

27:10.822 --> 27:13.148
So, do you bring
all your dates here?

27:13.700 --> 27:15.859
Just the ones I really
want to impress.

27:16.453 --> 27:18.778
Well, I should tell you that
I'm not easily impressed...

27:18.914 --> 27:22.746
...by a fancy place.
- Well, I have to work harder to impress you.

27:24.378 --> 27:26.667
I'm waiting.
- Now?

27:27.131 --> 27:30.132
Oh, okay, I can spell the
word 'Connecticut'.

27:30.718 --> 27:31.963
Great, let's hear it!

27:33.053 --> 27:34.429
Alright, you got me.

27:36.223 --> 27:38.015
How long have you
been coming here?

27:38.184 --> 27:41.304
Eh, about since we started the agency.
So, about four years.

27:41.437 --> 27:44.438
Since 'we started the agency'?
- My partner and I.

27:44.565 --> 27:47.650
Oh, you have a partner?
I thought it was your place.

27:48.611 --> 27:49.642
Pretty lame!

27:51.531 --> 27:55.030
But still, four years, that's...
that's impressive.

27:56.077 --> 27:57.108
Oh!

27:59.080 --> 28:00.111
Got it.

28:01.166 --> 28:02.957
That is impressive too!

28:06.296 --> 28:07.459
Ah...

28:08.632 --> 28:11.835
Well, I had a...
really nice time.

28:12.344 --> 28:15.464
I don't blame you.
- Well! Narcissism is hot.

28:15.639 --> 28:18.556
So is sarcasm.
- Well, you can work on that next time.

28:19.184 --> 28:21.971
So, you're assuming that there's
going to be a next time?

28:23.814 --> 28:25.142
I hope so.

28:27.902 --> 28:29.182
We'll see.

28:31.447 --> 28:32.775
Good night.

28:35.409 --> 28:36.654
Good night.

28:51.843 --> 28:53.919
I can't even remember
the last time I did this.

28:54.095 --> 28:56.135
You see, that is exactly
why you need to be doing it.

28:56.931 --> 28:58.390
Really? That's why?

28:58.600 --> 29:01.470
Well, and the fact that I need to assert
my manhood by challenging you to an...

29:01.645 --> 29:03.518
...activity that I know
I can win.

29:03.647 --> 29:05.639
I think most guy
would have picked bowling.

29:05.774 --> 29:07.766
No, too risky
You might beat me.

29:08.527 --> 29:09.725
And if I did?

29:09.903 --> 29:12.821
Unfortunately, I don't have anywhere near
enough self-esteem to keep this up...

29:12.990 --> 29:15.397
...a blow like that.
So...

29:15.951 --> 29:20.280
Couldn't you just challenge me to something else?
- Not really good at a lot of things.

29:20.414 --> 29:21.363
Dreamy...

29:21.498 --> 29:23.224
Listen, is it safer for any...

29:23.225 --> 29:24.950
...possible relationship
that we 'mini-golf' ...

29:25.127 --> 29:28.496
...'coz... baby,
I'm great at this!

29:28.881 --> 29:31.502
All right.
Show me what you've got.

29:37.640 --> 29:38.885
That's right...

29:39.892 --> 29:43.557
So, when was the last time you went 'golfing'?
- Does 'miniature-golf' count?

29:43.688 --> 29:44.767
I'm afraid not.

29:45.356 --> 29:47.894
I love it out here,
I try to come as much as I can.

29:49.027 --> 29:51.565
Alright... ladies first!

29:52.071 --> 29:54.064
Oh, really? Okay.

29:56.284 --> 29:58.193
Okay, ready?
Okay.

30:03.291 --> 30:06.079
Oh, promise me that you're not
going to tell anyone about that.

30:06.336 --> 30:10.001
I try not to make promises that I
absolutely have no intention of keeping.

30:10.132 --> 30:11.590
I'm old-fashioned,
that way.

30:11.758 --> 30:15.756
I don't understand what is it with
this obsession guys have with golf?

30:16.221 --> 30:18.712
I wouldn't call it an obsession.
Have I seen all the movies?

30:18.891 --> 30:20.551
Yes.
More than once? Yes.

30:20.726 --> 30:23.299
If you ask me what planet Chewbacca's from?
I would say Kashyyyk.

30:23.437 --> 30:25.180
But does that really cause me to have an obsession?

30:25.356 --> 30:28.559
I'm not saying that
they're not great movies.

30:28.692 --> 30:31.018
They are. You know,
how many of them do we need?

30:31.153 --> 30:33.858
I don't know. How many times did
they remake 'Pride and Prejudice'?

30:34.031 --> 30:35.823
One a year, every year?

30:35.950 --> 30:39.366
Mr. Darcy expressing
his undying devotion?

30:40.079 --> 30:42.487
You can't see that
too many times.

30:42.832 --> 30:45.537
You see, I feel the same way.
Just take up Mr.Darcy...

30:45.710 --> 30:49.209
Instead of Princess Leia and replace the
look of undying devotion with a golf keen.

30:49.339 --> 30:53.467
Okay, I can live with that,
just as long as your taste in music isn't lame.

30:53.885 --> 30:55.676
What's your favourite kind?
Don't think, just answer.

30:55.804 --> 30:56.799
Classic rock.

30:56.930 --> 30:59.765
What do you consider 'classic'?
- Anything but 'country'.

31:01.434 --> 31:04.934
What's the worst date you've ever been on?
- Besides this?

31:07.315 --> 31:09.392
You know I have the keys
to the car, right?

31:09.860 --> 31:11.188
Favorite president?

31:11.320 --> 31:13.063
Rutherford B. Hayes.

31:13.906 --> 31:16.231
You can't just
make up a name...

31:20.537 --> 31:24.072
So, how's the writing going?
- Well, pretty well, actually.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.167
Better than it's been
a long time, I think.

31:27.336 --> 31:28.747
Starting something new.

31:29.505 --> 31:31.961
Can I read it?
- It depends...

31:32.675 --> 31:35.592
Can you be honest with me about what
you think or are you one of those girls...

31:35.761 --> 31:38.679
...who's gonna be like, "Oh,
I love it"? Then, stop calling me.

31:39.223 --> 31:41.596
I think I'm totally
incapable of false praise...

31:41.768 --> 31:44.389
It's like...
a natural deficiency or something.

31:44.562 --> 31:45.677
Then, you're on.

31:52.612 --> 31:54.439
I love this building.
- Oh, me too.

31:54.572 --> 31:56.155
The view from the
roof is amazing!

31:56.156 --> 31:57.739
I've never seen it.

31:58.660 --> 31:59.988
You're kidding?

32:00.120 --> 32:01.318
You've never seen it?
- No!

32:01.455 --> 32:04.124
Well, we gotta check this out.
- I'm sure it has been closed for hours.

32:05.667 --> 32:10.910
Yeah, you're right, although
I wonder if this would...

32:13.926 --> 32:15.503
...do anything.

32:23.018 --> 32:24.928
Have you lived
in any place else?

32:25.062 --> 32:26.011
Not yet.

32:26.147 --> 32:28.685
You planning on movin'?
- I don't know. Maybe someday.

32:29.358 --> 32:31.018
Not me,
I like it here.

32:31.736 --> 32:34.191
My sister is here,
my niece and nephews are here...

32:35.031 --> 32:36.988
I know this town like
the back of...

32:39.619 --> 32:41.030
I'm so...

32:41.162 --> 32:44.198
Ouch... agile,
coordinated?

32:44.457 --> 32:46.913
Yeah and...
really sorry.

32:52.590 --> 32:53.456
Wow...

32:54.259 --> 32:56.750
Yeah... not the worst
thing ever.

33:16.699 --> 33:18.157
Wow!

33:18.284 --> 33:21.320
Yeah... not the worst
thing ever.

33:27.376 --> 33:30.543
Your aunt kicked me out of the dining room...
so that I should be helping you.

33:30.671 --> 33:32.463
Here. Slice the bread.

33:33.508 --> 33:37.375
She told me she wants you to help!
- Don't believe his lies!

33:37.512 --> 33:38.757
I never do.

33:39.472 --> 33:40.421
So...

33:42.308 --> 33:45.095
How are things?
- My things are good.

33:46.688 --> 33:50.187
David tells me your love-life has
taken a recent leap in activity.

33:51.109 --> 33:53.066
Yeah, you could
say that.

33:53.987 --> 33:56.656
Well, you could say that
as if it's a bad thing.

33:57.282 --> 33:59.109
I just want to be honest.

34:00.535 --> 34:02.528
No one ever said that you have to reveal everything...

34:02.663 --> 34:04.702
...to any guy you date.

34:04.831 --> 34:07.453
No, I know, I know
but still I just...

34:07.584 --> 34:11.795
You just give yourself some time.
Nothing wrong with taking it slow.

34:12.130 --> 34:14.835
That's 'big' talk coming from a guy who
said he fell in love with aunt Linda...

34:14.967 --> 34:17.292
...the second he laid
eyes on her.

34:17.428 --> 34:18.590
That was different.

34:19.054 --> 34:23.301
With me, one girl is all it took.
I hit the 'jackpot' first time I took the gamble.

34:24.643 --> 34:26.683
How did you know
that she was the one?

34:29.023 --> 34:30.221
She, eh...

34:34.737 --> 34:36.231
She inspired me.

34:45.623 --> 34:48.909
<i>Remember that rainy evening
I took you out</i>

34:49.043 --> 34:52.708
<i>With nothing but
a fine-tuned comb...</i>

34:52.880 --> 34:56.380
<i>I know no one's to blame
but then what a shame...</i>

34:56.510 --> 35:00.377
<i>Hey baby, won't you please
come home!</i>

35:03.308 --> 35:07.057
I can't believe you've never been here.
- Only because I've never wanted to come.

35:07.396 --> 35:09.602
This place is all musicals.
That's all I need to hear.

35:09.731 --> 35:12.436
How do you not like musicals?
- They don't make any sense.

35:12.568 --> 35:15.438
Musicals make total sense.
- What's your favorite musical?

35:15.571 --> 35:16.816
'West Side Story'.
- It makes no sense.

35:16.947 --> 35:18.228
It's 'Romeo and Juliet'.

35:18.365 --> 35:20.773
It's two gangs dancing
while they fight.

35:20.951 --> 35:23.621
Okay, so next,
you're going to tell me you hate 'Sounds Of Music'.

35:23.746 --> 35:25.703
Oh, please you askin'
me of the 'singing' nuns.

35:25.873 --> 35:29.076
But you have to like 'Grease'.
- No, I have to do no such things.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.582
Everyone likes 'Grease'.

35:31.712 --> 35:34.832
The only nice thing I can say about
'Grease' is that there's not a 'Grease 2'.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.836
I happen to love 'Grease 2'.
- 'Shut your mouth'.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.886
I'm not going to apologize
for loving 'Grease 2'.

35:41.055 --> 35:43.428
'Grease 2' should apologize
to 'Grease 2'.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.930
Have you ever seen it?
- No, I've never seen it!

35:46.102 --> 35:48.142
Okay, so how could you judge a movie
you've never seen?

35:48.271 --> 35:51.142
I don't have to see 'Grease 2'
to know it's 'Grease 2'.

36:02.202 --> 36:04.776
<i>I don't iron his shirts...</i>

36:06.999 --> 36:09.916
<i>I don't sew on his buttons...</i>

36:11.545 --> 36:14.879
<i>I don't know of all
the jokes he tells...</i>

36:16.050 --> 36:18.671
<i>...or the songs he hums.</i>

36:21.305 --> 36:24.721
<i>But he says he loves me...</i>

36:26.102 --> 36:28.889
<i>And I believe it's true...</i>

36:30.857 --> 36:37.088
<i>Doesn't that makes someone...
belong to you?</i>

36:37.089 --> 36:43.685
Maver.ikk

36:55.549 --> 36:56.877
Okay, open 'em.

37:00.387 --> 37:01.466
Wow!

37:03.307 --> 37:04.884
What's the occasion?

37:05.017 --> 37:06.297
It's Tuesday!

37:09.605 --> 37:11.763
How did you arranged
all these?

37:11.899 --> 37:15.517
Well, I think secrets are an important
part of every relationships.

37:15.694 --> 37:17.438
Wouldn't you agree?

37:17.863 --> 37:19.488
You've no idea.

37:20.950 --> 37:24.117
This is the best place in
the city to look at the stars.

37:25.288 --> 37:27.245
Are you a man who knows
his constellations?

37:27.373 --> 37:28.832
You mean 'the constellations' man?
- Yeah.

37:29.000 --> 37:29.830
Yeah.

37:30.042 --> 37:32.913
Alright, see those three near each other,
but they're branching off at the top...

37:33.046 --> 37:36.082
...in different directions?
That's the 'eternal tree'.

37:37.175 --> 37:38.420
What about that one?

37:38.593 --> 37:41.131
Oh, that's my favorite.
That's the 'Lion's Triumph'.

37:41.638 --> 37:44.045
Meaning?
- I have no idea. I just want to sound smart.

37:44.224 --> 37:45.386
It almost works.

37:47.060 --> 37:48.720
How about that one
over there?

37:50.605 --> 37:52.100
Well, no clue.

37:52.524 --> 37:54.184
Maybe we should name it.

37:55.152 --> 37:57.607
Yeah, we can call it...
'Jesse'.

37:59.239 --> 38:02.026
You want to name it after me?
- Well, Yeah, I really like you.

38:02.618 --> 38:04.409
I really like you too.

38:04.578 --> 38:06.986
No, no, no,
I like... 'LIKE' you.

38:09.375 --> 38:12.162
Meaning, em...
I think I'm falling for you.

38:12.711 --> 38:14.870
I know... I know I'm falling
for you.

38:17.049 --> 38:20.833
I'm freaking you out right now.
Maybe I should just kiss you.

38:41.658 --> 38:42.986
Hey.
- Hey.

38:46.121 --> 38:47.366
Good date?

38:47.873 --> 38:49.153
Yeah, great date.

38:53.754 --> 38:54.749
What?

38:55.631 --> 38:58.335
Nothing, just sounds like
it's getting serious.

38:59.551 --> 39:00.796
Maybe.

39:05.474 --> 39:06.470
What?

39:07.476 --> 39:09.220
I didn't say anything.

39:11.272 --> 39:14.475
Ethan has made it perfectly clear that
I don't have to tell him...

39:14.650 --> 39:16.607
...anything until I'm ready.

39:18.946 --> 39:21.864
I have to figure out how
I'm going to figure this out.

39:23.743 --> 39:26.068
Sure... I mean take
your time.

39:28.122 --> 39:30.495
Let me just...
lay it all out there.

39:31.918 --> 39:33.875
Tell Ethan everything.

39:36.965 --> 39:38.957
Am I making a mess?

39:39.843 --> 39:40.838
No.

39:42.554 --> 39:45.259
Maybe, I don't know.

39:50.562 --> 39:52.768
I'm gonna tell him
the next time I see him.

39:56.026 --> 39:59.360
And if he leaves me, then...
problem solved, right?

40:00.322 --> 40:02.279
I mean, if he doesn't think
I'm worth it...

40:02.449 --> 40:03.944
...then, he's an idiot.

40:08.706 --> 40:09.737
Good night.

40:10.499 --> 40:11.662
Good night.

40:22.887 --> 40:26.588
Okay, I have to warn you.
My sister's house can be a little...

40:27.600 --> 40:29.972
What?
- Intense... at first.

40:30.937 --> 40:32.182
You'll be great!

40:34.232 --> 40:35.097
Hello?

40:35.775 --> 40:37.234
Hello?
- Uncle Ethan!

40:39.487 --> 40:42.061
Hey, guys! This is my girlfriend, Jesse.
This is Hayley and Conner.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.612
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

40:44.868 --> 40:45.983
You're pretty.

40:46.119 --> 40:47.661
No, you're pretty!

40:47.788 --> 40:50.409
No, I think all girls are dumb.
- Hey!

40:50.749 --> 40:52.742
Where are you goin'?
Get out of town, you monkey!

40:52.918 --> 40:55.587
Alright, enough impressing
our guests.

40:55.712 --> 40:57.372
Hey, Baggy.
- Hello, Baggy.

40:57.881 --> 41:00.586
Jesse, my sister, Sarah.
- Hi, Sarah, nice to meet you.

41:00.759 --> 41:03.429
Jesse, so good to meet you.
Welcome to the 'circus'.

41:03.595 --> 41:05.339
Oh, that's Adam.
Our littlest.

41:05.472 --> 41:07.845
Is he okay?
- Oh, a little fuzzy today, but he's alright.

41:08.017 --> 41:09.844
Hey, Bill! This is my brother-in-law, Bill.
This is Jesse.

41:09.977 --> 41:12.978
Hi!
- Hey! How are you? Bill Walters. Wow...

41:13.773 --> 41:15.397
It's okay... it's okay.
- Sorry.

41:15.524 --> 41:19.605
Clearly, you can see, we keep a little informal
around here... Please just make yourself at home.

41:19.779 --> 41:23.029
Dinner is almost ready.
I've gotta go to deal with the baby.

41:23.199 --> 41:24.942
Come on, let's go wash up!
Let's go... go!

41:25.076 --> 41:26.867
We've got some serious barbecue
going on out back.

41:26.995 --> 41:28.952
But Ethan told me that
you're a vegetarian...

41:29.080 --> 41:30.907
So, I got you some 'pork'.

41:32.417 --> 41:35.122
Great!
- For the others... not meat.

41:49.685 --> 41:51.428
Get back here...

41:53.605 --> 41:54.471
Hey.

41:56.650 --> 41:58.939
Come on uncle Ethan!
Let's go play 'Spies Tag'!

41:59.069 --> 42:02.070
You know what, buddy?
I think we're gonna stay here and relax a little bit.

42:02.197 --> 42:04.155
No! Please, please!

42:04.283 --> 42:06.489
Oh, how can you say
no to that?

42:06.619 --> 42:09.785
Oh. Alright. I'll be right back.
I'm great at this game.

42:09.914 --> 42:11.456
You better go,
I'll get you!

42:17.255 --> 42:19.543
Hey, he really is good
at this game.

42:20.967 --> 42:24.336
Yeah, he should be. He has had enough practice.
- That's for sure.

42:25.305 --> 42:27.878
Your children are beautiful.
- Thank you.

42:28.766 --> 42:32.349
They certainly love their uncle.
It's like having a 'on-call' babysitter.

42:32.771 --> 42:33.969
If anything comes up...

42:34.147 --> 42:37.682
Yeah, if we just wanna get away
for a couple of hours...

42:37.859 --> 42:39.733
- Bill!
- Alright? It's true!

42:43.406 --> 42:44.652
Oh, hello.
- Hello...

42:44.783 --> 42:47.903
Are you and uncle Ethan going to
get married and have a baby?

42:48.453 --> 42:52.700
Oh, okay, Hayley, I think that
uncle Ethan needs to be chased.

42:52.833 --> 42:54.826
Why don't you go chase him?
- Okay.

42:55.127 --> 42:57.618
Where are you gettin' off?
Where are you gettin' off?

42:57.755 --> 43:02.030
Wahhh! I'm the 'Beast'!
Where? Where?...

43:21.571 --> 43:24.440
Yes! I'm gonna get you!
I'm gonna get you!

43:24.949 --> 43:26.147
Thank you!

43:26.284 --> 43:28.692
Nice meeting you, 'bye!

43:29.245 --> 43:30.277
'Bye!

43:30.622 --> 43:34.916
Okay, seriously I think I hurt something.
- Those kids are so crazy about you!

43:35.543 --> 43:38.117
Big 'E'!
- And I'm crazy about them.

43:41.133 --> 43:42.675
Thank you.
- Yeah!

43:48.348 --> 43:51.599
Oh... I almost forgot.
I found something of yours.

43:51.727 --> 43:53.601
What?
- Close your eyes.

43:53.771 --> 43:54.719
Close!

43:55.064 --> 43:56.095
Okay?

43:57.399 --> 43:58.348
Okay.

43:58.776 --> 43:59.890
Open.

44:02.822 --> 44:04.731
It's 'Firefly'.
- Yeah...

44:05.533 --> 44:07.988
How did you...?
Where did you find...?

44:08.160 --> 44:12.158
She just showed up on my doorstep yesterday...
in a box from ebay.

44:16.169 --> 44:18.292
This is the nicest thing anyone
has ever given me.

44:18.463 --> 44:20.206
Oh, come on,
I hope that's not true.

44:21.883 --> 44:24.041
Thank you. - You're welcome.
- Thank you so much.

44:27.472 --> 44:28.635
So, what did you
want to tell me?

44:29.891 --> 44:31.054
What do you mean?

44:31.267 --> 44:35.265
Oh, I hear you said you've something to tell
me but it could wait after my sister's house.

44:35.981 --> 44:37.179
I, er...

44:39.317 --> 44:40.183
What?

44:40.694 --> 44:44.774
I just...
wanted to tell you how happy you make me.

44:47.159 --> 44:49.566
Good. I like you happy.

44:51.872 --> 44:54.363
Is that all you wanted to tell me?
- Yeah!

44:56.418 --> 44:58.826
You can talk to me about anything, you know that?
- I know, I know, yeah.

44:59.505 --> 45:01.747
Well, prove it.
You can talk to me right now.

45:03.634 --> 45:05.294
There is nothing.

45:12.018 --> 45:13.097
Okay.

45:33.290 --> 45:34.072
Hi!

45:34.374 --> 45:37.292
- I can help you?
- I'm Jesse. I'm here to see Troy.

45:38.962 --> 45:41.121
Troy, there is someone
here to see you.

45:41.256 --> 45:42.287
Okay.

45:43.216 --> 45:44.960
He'll be right out.
- Thanks.

45:50.224 --> 45:51.338
There she is!

45:51.517 --> 45:52.715
Hi, T.

45:53.936 --> 45:55.810
Alright, let me show
you around.

45:57.523 --> 45:59.432
You doing alright?
- Yeah, how's your day been?

45:59.567 --> 46:00.646
Good, good.

46:01.444 --> 46:03.935
Troy, I've got the Clear magazine
spread for you to look out.

46:04.071 --> 46:06.397
Thanks, Mike, I'll stop by
your desk this afternoon.

46:06.616 --> 46:09.486
Troy, can I get your opinion on this local survey?
- Can I come by a little later?

46:09.619 --> 46:11.196
Sure.
- Thanks, Brandy.

46:13.331 --> 46:14.445
Hey, Garrett!

46:14.624 --> 46:17.411
I want you to meet Jesse.
- Yes, Jesse...

46:17.543 --> 46:20.663
- Hi! I heard a lot about you.
- Oh, good things, I hope.

46:20.838 --> 46:21.668
Oh, pretty good.

46:21.840 --> 46:24.794
Oh, Troy usually sensed really horrific
stuff about other people.

46:24.926 --> 46:26.919
That's not true,
just about you.

46:27.637 --> 46:30.211
I'm gonna show her around.
- Well, you think you own the place?

46:30.390 --> 46:33.593
No, Garrett, I think you own the place.
- That's right... don't forget it.

46:34.436 --> 46:37.472
Actually, you know, Jesse, we get
most of our clients...

46:37.606 --> 46:40.061
...based on Troy's
reputation alone.

46:40.942 --> 46:43.350
Well, don't you forget that.
- I can't forget that.

46:43.528 --> 46:45.071
We'll see you in a bit.
- Okay dokey.

46:45.197 --> 46:47.984
Very nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you too, take care. - Okay, 'bye.

46:49.993 --> 46:52.449
So, this is your home
during the day.

46:52.579 --> 46:53.824
And some nights.

46:53.956 --> 46:56.245
I spend so much time here,
I figure I might as well make it as comfortable...

46:56.375 --> 46:57.917
...as a place can be
as possible.

46:59.754 --> 47:01.212
It's really big.

47:01.630 --> 47:04.204
Yeah, well, over compensating
for something, obviously.

47:04.342 --> 47:06.085
I prefer not to
say what.

47:08.846 --> 47:10.091
What are you
working on?

47:10.306 --> 47:12.346
Oh... this is a
potential client.

47:12.517 --> 47:15.221
I'm trying to come up with a
"slogan" for their nasal spray.

47:15.395 --> 47:18.016
You know, if I can dazzle them,
they'll definitely sign with us.

47:18.982 --> 47:20.357
You're pretty
dazzling.

47:20.525 --> 47:23.645
It's a lot easier if you have a specific audience,
this 'nasal spray' is for everybody.

47:23.778 --> 47:25.605
Everybody with a nose.

47:26.740 --> 47:28.779
Yeah, well said.

47:30.827 --> 47:33.579
Woo... I'm starving.
Can we talk about that?

47:33.872 --> 47:37.241
Absolutely, tell me what's on your mind?
- Wait! Come on!

47:49.638 --> 47:54.799
<i>I see the sunbeam.
The perfect rain...</i>

47:55.436 --> 48:00.596
<i>I want to send out a
gazillion bouquet...</i>

48:01.442 --> 48:06.602
<i>I hear the chords
that resonate...</i>

48:07.406 --> 48:13.409
<i>It's just another
o..o..o..o..ordinary day...</i>

48:25.091 --> 48:30.252
<i>I look from your eyes
down to your lips...</i>

48:31.056 --> 48:36.216
<i>I feel it from my toes
down to my figertips...</i>

48:37.062 --> 48:42.222
<i>I see the clouds change
a sweet array...</i>

48:42.901 --> 48:48.904
<i>It's just another
o..o..o..o..ordinary day...</i>

48:51.035 --> 48:54.036
"NOW YOU HAVE A PLANT
LOVE, ETHAN"

49:10.263 --> 49:13.133
<i>o..o..o..o..ordinary day...</i>

49:15.184 --> 49:19.052
<i>o..o..o..o..ordinary day...</i>

49:20.982 --> 49:25.027
<i>o..o..o..o..ordinary day...</i>

49:26.029 --> 49:27.488
"JESSE, I LOVE YOU!
- TROY"

49:27.656 --> 49:30.906
<i>o..o..o..o..ordinary day...</i>

49:32.911 --> 49:36.956
<i>o..o..o..o..ordinary day...</i>

49:40.627 --> 49:42.620
Oh, come on, no way!

49:43.088 --> 49:44.748
Yes-way.
Don't act surprised.

49:44.923 --> 49:48.292
No, look, something's wrong with this controller.
I press 'X' and nothing's happenin'.

49:48.427 --> 49:50.467
Yeah, it's the
'controller's' fault.

49:50.638 --> 49:52.677
Oh, shut up! I'm serious!
The thing is broken.

49:52.848 --> 49:55.339
No, I think it's the guy who's using it, actually.
- You know what?

49:55.518 --> 49:58.305
You play this game all the time and you
know that controller works better...

49:58.437 --> 50:00.145
Hi. Sorry.
- Hi, wow.

50:00.314 --> 50:02.722
I didn't know you were here.
- I didn't know you were here!

50:02.859 --> 50:05.432
Is everything okay?
- Yeah! Just fine. David invited me over.

50:05.611 --> 50:06.856
Will you pause it
please?!

50:07.989 --> 50:11.689
He called and we got to talking.
Did you know that his cousin is a lawyer?

50:12.160 --> 50:14.865
No, I didn't know that.
- Yeah, he works in contracts, I...

50:15.038 --> 50:17.363
...thought maybe he can help
him out with his 'gum' situation.

50:17.499 --> 50:19.041
I was talking to his cousin,
he said that...

50:19.042 --> 50:21.194
ZZZZZZZ....

50:21.670 --> 50:24.540
He said that he thinks he can get
me out of the contract or at least...

50:24.714 --> 50:27.834
...renegotiate so that they have to
pay me for as long as it's running.

50:28.093 --> 50:29.552
That's amazing.

50:29.678 --> 50:32.513
Will you guys go to the store with me
so that I don't have to go by myself?

50:32.639 --> 50:34.383
Of course,
we're almost done here.

50:34.516 --> 50:36.972
I bet you mean I
'destroyed' you.

50:37.102 --> 50:38.133
Oh...

50:38.896 --> 50:40.687
Okay, I'll be right back.

50:40.814 --> 50:42.012
"Unpause."

50:44.318 --> 50:45.812
Hey, no way,
you'll a 'quitter' now!

50:52.034 --> 50:52.900
Excuse me!

50:53.035 --> 50:54.695
Excuse me, sir!
- Hey, dude!

50:55.913 --> 50:58.072
You are awesome, man!
- Wow!

50:58.916 --> 51:01.407
Could you take a picture?
- We actually have to go.

51:01.544 --> 51:04.296
No, are you kidding?
Don't be silly. He loves this stuff!

51:04.464 --> 51:05.377
Alright, okay.

51:06.049 --> 51:08.622
It's awesome!
- Breathe, man, breathe!

51:09.385 --> 51:11.793
That was mean!
- It's good for him.

51:13.890 --> 51:14.969
Hey, check it out!

51:15.058 --> 51:15.923
Oh, look at this!

51:16.017 --> 51:18.259
I mean, honestly,
who writes those?

51:18.395 --> 51:20.268
I don't know but I've been
thinking about it.

51:21.273 --> 51:23.764
About what?
- About going into commercial advertising.

51:23.900 --> 51:26.652
Seems like a writer could
actually make a living.

51:28.363 --> 51:33.156
Yeah, but...
would you be happy doing that?

51:34.411 --> 51:35.407
I don't know.

51:35.704 --> 51:37.862
But if I don't make enough money
doing what makes me happy...

51:38.040 --> 51:40.661
...then, I'm gonna have to settle on something, right?

51:44.088 --> 51:46.579
I'm so serious.
That's not funny!

51:48.008 --> 51:51.757
Erm... I don't mean to bother you,
but would you mind?

51:53.514 --> 51:55.305
Be nice. He is a kid.

51:57.143 --> 51:58.886
That'll be five dollars.

51:59.061 --> 52:00.935
Be nice!
- You can't do that...

52:01.647 --> 52:03.770
Sorry, sorry about that.
- It's free this time.

52:03.900 --> 52:06.058
Next time, you pay.
- Thank you!

52:09.113 --> 52:11.865
So, did you mean what
you said before?

52:12.033 --> 52:13.231
What... at the store?

52:13.368 --> 52:14.364
Yeah.

52:14.661 --> 52:15.443
Yeah.

52:17.247 --> 52:18.361
Maybe.

52:19.624 --> 52:24.619
Look, I just think that it might be time
for me to get a little more serious.

52:25.464 --> 52:28.998
Think about my future instead of
going after this whole 'writing' thing.

52:29.134 --> 52:30.925
But it's your dream.
- Yes.

52:31.720 --> 52:34.176
But it's definitely
not my 'reality'.

52:35.098 --> 52:38.931
And I want to have a family
...someday.

52:39.603 --> 52:43.435
So, I think I might need to settle for a
career that is a little more realistic.

52:46.986 --> 52:48.017
You can't quit.

52:48.612 --> 52:49.442
Why?

52:49.572 --> 52:52.110
Besides the fact that I love it.
Why? Give me one good reason.

52:52.241 --> 52:54.198
Because I know you're
going to make it.

52:54.952 --> 52:56.660
Okay, That is
pretty good, but...

52:57.663 --> 53:00.333
Promise me...
you won't give up.

53:03.878 --> 53:06.832
Promise me.
- Why are you so sure of me?

53:07.006 --> 53:09.378
Because I know you, Ethan.
You are talented.

53:10.134 --> 53:13.171
And you shouldn't settle.
You can have everything you want out of life.

53:14.889 --> 53:15.969
And I...

53:19.436 --> 53:20.930
I believe in you.

53:25.817 --> 53:26.813
Thank you.

53:29.237 --> 53:30.898
You're my 'Charlie Brown'.

53:31.573 --> 53:33.233
I'm your what now?

53:33.408 --> 53:36.493
When I was a kid, there used
to be these 'Charlie Brown' ...

53:36.662 --> 53:38.820
...Specials on TV.
- Yeah...

53:38.998 --> 53:43.790
And there was one where Charlie
Brown had a crush ...

53:43.961 --> 53:46.001
...on this little girl.
- Oh, the redhead girl.

53:46.130 --> 53:47.873
- Yes, exactly.
- Yeah.

53:48.132 --> 53:51.086
And through the whole cartoon,
he was totally smitten.

53:51.510 --> 53:54.677
And then, finally...
the little girl kissed him.

53:55.598 --> 53:58.599
And suddenly,
Charlie Brown was flying.

53:59.227 --> 54:04.387
And I mean... really flying...
like through the clouds, soaring.

54:04.691 --> 54:07.146
And I just totally
didn't get it.

54:07.443 --> 54:09.520
And so, I asked my mom
what was going on?

54:09.696 --> 54:11.024
And she told me...

54:12.282 --> 54:15.781
"That's exactly how I feel every
time I kiss your father."

54:17.203 --> 54:20.703
So, naturally, I thought my
dad had some kind of...

54:20.832 --> 54:23.121
...magical kissing power!

54:23.376 --> 54:26.792
That whoever kisses him
gets to feel like they're fine.

54:26.964 --> 54:27.959
Sure...

54:28.257 --> 54:29.585
So, I tried it.

54:31.426 --> 54:34.178
I kissed him...
and I closed my eyes.

54:34.930 --> 54:38.714
And I concentrated really,
really hard.

54:40.019 --> 54:42.095
And absolutely nothing
happened.

54:43.022 --> 54:43.935
Nothing.

54:44.231 --> 54:45.891
I was so bombed.

54:46.233 --> 54:49.733
And I tried it a few more times
and eventually just gave up.

54:51.447 --> 54:53.689
I actually forgot
all about it.

54:54.659 --> 54:56.947
Until the first time
you kissed me.

54:58.955 --> 55:01.327
And then I remembered
Charlie Brown.

55:05.753 --> 55:06.998
Promise me.

55:11.551 --> 55:14.386
I promise... for now.

55:36.285 --> 55:37.744
Hi!
- Hi.

55:39.330 --> 55:42.247
What are you doing here?
- Well, can't your boyfriend stop by?

55:42.416 --> 55:45.334
Of course, I'm just...
surprised.

55:45.461 --> 55:47.501
Well, I wanted to surprise you.
Come on, grab your coat!

55:47.630 --> 55:48.626
All right.

55:51.842 --> 55:53.503
What are we doing here?
- Grab a seat.

55:59.225 --> 56:01.716
"FOR EVERYBODY
WITH A NOSE."

56:01.853 --> 56:03.477
We got it.
- You got it?

56:03.605 --> 56:06.938
No, no, we got it. They loved it!
We're launching this fall.

56:07.066 --> 56:08.312
Congratulations!

56:08.485 --> 56:10.145
To you too!
- No.

56:10.278 --> 56:12.401
That is your line.
I would have never come up with that.

56:12.572 --> 56:14.031
No, no.
- You're smarter than me.

56:14.157 --> 56:15.984
Nobody's denying that.

56:18.036 --> 56:20.871
Did my superior intelligence
just emasculate you?

56:20.997 --> 56:23.535
Because that's bound to happen,
eventually.

56:26.420 --> 56:28.211
There's... more.

56:29.423 --> 56:30.502
Okay.

56:31.216 --> 56:34.668
For a while now, Garrett
and I have been talking about...

56:34.803 --> 56:37.804
...expanding the agency.
Opening another branch.

56:38.432 --> 56:40.259
Well, this kinda put it
over the top for us.

56:40.434 --> 56:44.183
Since I developed the concept "Clear"
wants me to head up the design.

56:44.355 --> 56:48.602
Which I would do at our...
new branch... in Austin.

56:49.527 --> 56:51.935
The one in the middle
of Texas?

56:52.071 --> 56:54.741
That's the one, but it'll probably
for a few months.

56:54.866 --> 56:56.942
Once, we're running smoothly...
- Then, you'll move back?

56:57.118 --> 57:00.202
I can commute back and forth.
But I'm gonna be here all the time.

57:01.748 --> 57:05.033
When is this all going to happen?
- As soon as I say 'Yes'.

57:05.210 --> 57:06.787
And when will that be?

57:07.420 --> 57:09.876
As soon as you say
you will come with me.

57:10.465 --> 57:12.422
Don't say anything,
Just think about it.

57:12.592 --> 57:13.506
You, me...

57:13.635 --> 57:14.631
Austin...

57:15.345 --> 57:17.919
Some apartment we
try really hard to make hip...

57:18.098 --> 57:20.470
...but it's pathetically unhip.
It will be great!

57:23.604 --> 57:29.025
Wow... I don't know really what to say...

57:30.152 --> 57:32.441
Well... just think about it,
then.

57:32.571 --> 57:37.114
Take as long as you want but just say 'Yes'.
And by tomorrow night, if you can

57:43.374 --> 57:45.034
Run away with me.

57:47.211 --> 57:50.829
When you kiss me, I feel
like I'm flying.

57:53.634 --> 57:55.129
It's been known
to have happened.

58:09.651 --> 58:11.942
This is so amazing!
- Yeah!

58:12.779 --> 58:15.614
My parents and I used
to hike up here a lot.

58:16.116 --> 58:17.824
Seems like a tough
hike for a kid.

58:17.825 --> 58:19.532
I was a tough kid!

58:22.581 --> 58:24.739
I know you're such a
cute little boy.

58:24.917 --> 58:27.621
You know, when I was in 7th grade,
I brought home a progress report.

58:27.795 --> 58:29.621
Except I was failing
in science.

58:29.963 --> 58:32.170
My mother went ballistic!

58:32.758 --> 58:34.964
And the next day, my dad
brought me up here.

58:35.135 --> 58:37.709
And he told me the reason that they
were so upset was because they know...

58:37.847 --> 58:40.848
...how special I was,
and that I can do whatever I wanted in life...

58:41.016 --> 58:43.305
...if I was just willing
to work for it.

58:43.602 --> 58:47.387
And he really believed it.
He was so sure of me.

58:48.232 --> 58:50.355
Were you not so
sure of 'you'?

58:52.195 --> 58:54.733
What about you?
Have you felt totally sure about yourself?

58:54.864 --> 58:58.198
I think so, yeah.
I mean when I was younger.

58:59.160 --> 59:02.280
But I don't know, divorce has its weird
way of making you realize that...

59:02.414 --> 59:05.118
...you can't really be sure
of anything.

59:05.750 --> 59:07.707
Anything?
- Anything.

59:07.877 --> 59:09.372
Come on,
I don't buy that.

59:09.546 --> 59:13.164
Okay, has there ever been
anything that you've been...

59:13.341 --> 59:15.583
...totally sure of?

59:16.636 --> 59:20.765
Okay, I used to think, believe I
was going make it as a writer.

59:22.184 --> 59:24.722
I have become significantly
less sure of that...

59:24.895 --> 59:28.430
But... then I ran into
this girl at the cafe.

59:29.108 --> 59:30.103
Gorgeous...

59:30.234 --> 59:31.099
Funny...

59:31.235 --> 59:32.563
Blonde...
- Hey!

59:32.695 --> 59:35.067
I'm kidding... I'm kidding!
- That's not nice.

59:35.531 --> 59:40.110
And... I was 'sure' that I wanted
to talk to her.

59:41.078 --> 59:42.738
I wanted to get to
know her.

59:43.497 --> 59:45.823
And the more I got to know her,
the more I became sure...

59:46.000 --> 59:48.538
...that I've never met anyone
like her.

59:49.754 --> 59:52.957
And that everything with her is
better that anything without her.

59:54.634 --> 59:56.212
I'm better with her.

59:57.887 --> 59:59.002
So...

59:59.889 --> 01:00:02.677
I guess I've never really been sure
about anything except you.

01:00:04.311 --> 01:00:05.935
I'm 'sure' about you.

01:00:08.023 --> 01:00:10.478
I have fallen in love
with you, Jesse.

01:00:11.818 --> 01:00:13.692
I love you too.

01:00:15.364 --> 01:00:18.068
And I'm sure that...

01:00:19.159 --> 01:00:20.440
I want to spend...

01:00:22.371 --> 01:00:24.162
...the rest of my life
with you.

01:00:25.332 --> 01:00:27.289
Will you marry me?

01:00:32.006 --> 01:00:33.963
Ethan, you are
so amazing.

01:00:35.009 --> 01:00:37.251
Amazing enough
to marry?

01:00:41.641 --> 01:00:43.847
I don't even know what
to say to you right now.

01:00:45.019 --> 01:00:46.182
Was it the speech?

01:00:46.312 --> 01:00:49.017
I know the speech was too much but... Jesse!

01:00:49.357 --> 01:00:51.978
I know this is fast,
but I know that it's right.

01:00:52.485 --> 01:00:55.771
But I guess it's just not right for you...
- It's just...

01:00:58.241 --> 01:01:01.610
...a lot about me that
you still don't know.

01:01:01.786 --> 01:01:04.456
Okay, so tell me.
All of it and I'll marry you anyway.

01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:07.416
There is nothing you can say that
will change how I feel about you.

01:01:07.584 --> 01:01:08.864
I can't...

01:01:12.422 --> 01:01:13.833
Do you love me?

01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:17.210
Really, honestly love me?
- I love you so much.

01:01:17.386 --> 01:01:20.007
Then, talk to me.
- I can't, I can't...

01:01:20.139 --> 01:01:22.843
Jesse, I'm not blind.
I know you're not telling me something.

01:01:23.016 --> 01:01:25.887
The only thing frustrating about that...
is that you still don't feel like you can!

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:28.178
I can't!
- You can't or you won't?!

01:01:28.314 --> 01:01:29.689
I can't!

01:01:29.815 --> 01:01:32.650
Okay? I can't be who
you want me to be!

01:02:16.196 --> 01:02:19.233
Jesse, all I want
is you.

01:05:00.073 --> 01:05:01.236
Yes.

01:06:48.226 --> 01:06:50.349
Jesse, I don't know
what to do, eh ...

01:06:51.563 --> 01:06:53.686
Confused...
I am really confused.

01:06:53.857 --> 01:06:57.937
And I'm hurt and I don't understand
what happened, so...

01:06:59.154 --> 01:07:01.941
I think I'm just going to keep calling you...
leaving messages.

01:07:03.575 --> 01:07:09.448
I don't know.
I just... I miss you.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.875
I'm still here.

01:07:13.335 --> 01:07:15.127
And I miss you.

01:07:21.177 --> 01:07:22.208
Don't.

01:07:23.387 --> 01:07:26.139
I didn't say anything.
- It's what you're thinking.

01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:30.851
What am I thinking?
- That I made the wrong choice.

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.060
Are you sure that's not
what you're thinking?

01:07:36.234 --> 01:07:39.104
I just need to get out of here.
And things will be better.

01:07:39.737 --> 01:07:41.113
For you or for him?

01:07:43.449 --> 01:07:45.442
You want to know what
I'm really thinking?

01:07:46.745 --> 01:07:47.943
Do I have a choice?

01:07:48.121 --> 01:07:51.455
I think... that
you are an amazing person.

01:07:51.583 --> 01:07:53.575
And you deserve
to be happy.

01:07:54.419 --> 01:07:58.796
And I think if you don't tell Ethan
the truth about everything...

01:07:58.965 --> 01:08:02.085
You'll never going to be
as happy as you could be.

01:08:02.719 --> 01:08:04.344
No matter what happens.

01:08:46.598 --> 01:08:47.511
Yeah!

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:50.350
So, you've got it?

01:08:50.518 --> 01:08:52.558
Yeah, I've got it!
Is this for real?

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:56.728
Yes! What did I tell you, Ethan?
I've always said you've talent.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:59.734
But if I had known you
were capable of writing...

01:08:59.903 --> 01:09:03.354
...with so much pain!
With so much of thought!

01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:06.408
My God, I would have signed
you a long time ago.

01:09:06.577 --> 01:09:10.325
Congratulations, but you really
broke through on this one.

01:09:14.877 --> 01:09:17.118
Barbara. I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

01:09:17.254 --> 01:09:18.286
You go!

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:22.254
Celebrate! You'll be seeing so much
each other that you'll be sick of me.

01:09:24.886 --> 01:09:26.261
Okay, thank you.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.719
Jesse!

01:09:40.194 --> 01:09:41.938
Oh, please pick up!

01:09:42.322 --> 01:09:44.729
Hi, this is Jesse, please
leave a message.

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:52.198
Oh, sorry! Sorry!

01:10:02.134 --> 01:10:03.414
Come on,
come on...

01:10:17.566 --> 01:10:20.271
Ethan?
- David ... is she here?

01:10:20.861 --> 01:10:22.771
No. She's not.

01:10:24.448 --> 01:10:28.114
Look... I know she doesn't want to see me...
but if you just...

01:10:28.286 --> 01:10:29.151
Ethan.

01:10:29.454 --> 01:10:31.114
She is really
not here.

01:10:32.373 --> 01:10:34.781
Okay, can you tell me where she is?
- Eh...

01:10:36.085 --> 01:10:37.034
David.

01:10:37.462 --> 01:10:38.541
I love her.

01:10:39.047 --> 01:10:40.209
Please.

01:10:40.673 --> 01:10:42.333
She loves you too.

01:10:42.926 --> 01:10:44.337
But she's gone.

01:10:45.136 --> 01:10:47.295
She already left
for the airport.

01:10:48.682 --> 01:10:51.802
The airport?
- Ethan, run!

01:10:54.479 --> 01:10:55.855
All right. Thanks.

01:10:58.525 --> 01:11:00.767
Delta Flight 1182!

01:11:47.075 --> 01:11:48.356
Can I help you?

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:53.074
Can I help you, sir?

01:11:54.583 --> 01:11:56.160
No, thank you.

01:12:18.816 --> 01:12:20.441
I thought you left?

01:12:21.068 --> 01:12:22.646
I thought I would.

01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:27.862
I have to tell you
something.

01:12:29.327 --> 01:12:31.154
I need to tell
you something.

01:12:44.718 --> 01:12:47.090
You finished your manuscript?
- Yeah.

01:12:47.637 --> 01:12:48.586
And...

01:12:53.977 --> 01:12:55.804
Ethan, this is amazing.

01:12:58.273 --> 01:12:59.139
You did it.

01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:00.604
We did it.

01:13:00.984 --> 01:13:03.476
What are you talking about?
- The day that I met you...

01:13:04.697 --> 01:13:06.488
...something happened in me.

01:13:07.408 --> 01:13:08.783
You changed me.

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:13.119
And this story...
this is us.

01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:15.531
"TROY MEETS GIRL"

01:13:15.708 --> 01:13:18.958
My publisher tells me it has 'passion'...
and 'heart'...

01:13:22.507 --> 01:13:24.583
It's the best thing
I've ever written.

01:13:28.304 --> 01:13:31.590
So, how was the writing going?
- Pretty well, actually.

01:13:31.766 --> 01:13:32.929
I started something new.

01:13:33.059 --> 01:13:35.930
Ethan, you need a
leading man.

01:13:36.104 --> 01:13:39.639
You need somebody who is
handsome, and confident, and...

01:13:39.816 --> 01:13:41.892
...charismatic, and sexy.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.356
Excuse me?

01:13:43.945 --> 01:13:47.231
Hi, I called an order for pick-up.
My name is Troy.

01:13:48.033 --> 01:13:50.440
But I have a strange feeling that if I
don't make an exception this one time...

01:13:50.577 --> 01:13:52.119
I'm really going to
regret it.

01:13:54.748 --> 01:13:59.042
On top of everything else,
not only will I have to find some way
to strike up another conversation with you...

01:13:59.503 --> 01:14:01.840
I will have to come up with some
witty clever remarks so..

01:14:01.841 --> 01:14:04.680
...you won't think I'm some sort of idiot,
coming all the way back here just to talk to you.

01:14:07.261 --> 01:14:09.550
That's what I've been trying to do.
Draw from real life.

01:14:09.722 --> 01:14:12.592
Model the character
after my own experience.

01:14:17.271 --> 01:14:18.302
That's right...

01:14:22.902 --> 01:14:25.310
Oh, promise me you'll not
going to tell anyone about this!

01:14:25.446 --> 01:14:28.650
I never make promises that I have
absolutely no intention of keeping.

01:14:28.825 --> 01:14:30.652
I'm old fashioned that way.

01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:34.612
Until the first time
you kissed me.

01:14:34.831 --> 01:14:36.907
Then, I remembered
Charlie Brown.

01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:40.499
When you kiss me, I feel
like I'm flying.

01:14:51.181 --> 01:14:53.719
This guy, Troy...
- Yeah?

01:14:54.893 --> 01:14:56.637
He is nothing like you.

01:14:56.812 --> 01:15:01.141
Well... I had to change that 'coz no one
likes to read a story about a guy like me.

01:15:03.736 --> 01:15:05.479
And I changed the ending.

01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:09.734
Instead of leaving an envelope
on my doorstep, you showed up...

01:15:10.326 --> 01:15:12.781
Said, 'Yes' and we went
away together.

01:15:15.039 --> 01:15:17.411
Everybody loves
happy endings.

01:15:20.878 --> 01:15:25.291
I eh...
wanted to tell you everything.

01:15:26.593 --> 01:15:29.380
And be more...
open with you.

01:15:30.138 --> 01:15:36.223
But... I didn't believe that we can be together.

01:15:37.437 --> 01:15:41.269
I mean, really...
really be together.

01:15:43.068 --> 01:15:44.147
Like...

01:15:44.277 --> 01:15:46.733
Happily ever after
with four kids?

01:16:00.461 --> 01:16:02.334
I can't have children.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.418
I just can't.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:13.798
And that's why my ex-husband
divorced me and eh...

01:16:14.809 --> 01:16:18.344
I don't really blame him,
you know... because I...

01:16:20.982 --> 01:16:24.600
...couldn't give him
what he deserved, so...

01:16:27.405 --> 01:16:29.481
Why didn't you
tell me this?

01:16:30.742 --> 01:16:32.984
Because I was terrified.

01:16:33.411 --> 01:16:35.071
Jesse, I'm not him.

01:16:35.956 --> 01:16:38.162
And that's what
I was scared of.

01:16:38.458 --> 01:16:44.623
I mean, I was afraid that
you loved me enough that...

01:16:44.624 --> 01:16:46.757
...you would give
that up and...

01:16:50.762 --> 01:16:53.865
You know, I felt that if...

01:16:53.866 --> 01:16:58.288
...I really loved you,
then I couldnt ask you to give that up.

01:17:01.106 --> 01:17:03.597
To sacrifice that for me.

01:17:04.026 --> 01:17:05.105
I don't need that.

01:17:05.277 --> 01:17:06.309
No.

01:17:07.029 --> 01:17:08.938
But you deserve it.

01:17:10.157 --> 01:17:12.233
You deserve to be
a father.

01:17:14.996 --> 01:17:18.116
And you deserve to be with someone
that can give that to you...

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:24.711
Someone... whole
and complete.

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:36.218
So, I couldn't leave without
telling you all of that.

01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:43.429
Where are you going?

01:17:44.484 --> 01:17:46.940
I took a job in Portland.

01:17:47.863 --> 01:17:51.528
My best friend from High School lives
there and I'm going to live with her.

01:17:55.496 --> 01:17:58.283
This story has passion because
I'm passionate about you.

01:17:59.667 --> 01:18:01.743
I never could have written
it without you.

01:18:02.628 --> 01:18:06.044
Because I have never been this happy
as I am when I'm with you.

01:18:08.634 --> 01:18:12.299
Now you tell me that I deserve
someone whole and complete.

01:18:13.931 --> 01:18:16.802
I was never whole and complete
until I met you.

01:18:20.396 --> 01:18:22.223
I will never be a mother.

01:18:24.150 --> 01:18:25.526
Of course you will.

01:18:26.569 --> 01:18:29.274
We'll adopt.
We can have as many kids as you want.

01:18:30.865 --> 01:18:33.570
I mean, we should
keep trying, though.

01:18:33.743 --> 01:18:36.234
We should try a lot.
We should try right now.

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:44.793
On our first date, we were sitting
on that baseball field...

01:18:46.506 --> 01:18:50.836
And you said that life doesn't
always turn out the way you expect.

01:18:52.388 --> 01:18:53.668
Which is right...

01:18:53.931 --> 01:18:59.138
but... I think that if you stay...

01:19:00.646 --> 01:19:06.811
...and maybe marry me, we can
still have that 'happily ever after'.

01:19:10.781 --> 01:19:12.026
Yeah.

01:19:21.084 --> 01:19:23.456
Happily ever after? Really?

01:19:23.711 --> 01:19:26.285
Trust me, I am a writer...
soon to be published.

01:19:27.215 --> 01:19:30.501
Yeah, but Troy...
Can't you come up with a better name?

01:19:30.635 --> 01:19:32.379
Everyone is a critic!

01:19:35.098 --> 01:19:37.138
How come you
didn't change 'me'?

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:39.388
I couldn't change you.

01:19:40.187 --> 01:19:41.562
You're perfect.

01:19:50.781 --> 01:19:53.748
<i>Don't you worry there,
my honey ...</i>

01:19:53.784 --> 01:19:57.367
<i>We might not have any money...</i>

01:19:57.496 --> 01:20:02.158
<i>But we've got our love
to pay your bills...</i>

01:20:04.503 --> 01:20:07.837
<i>Maybe, I think you're
cute and funny...</i>

01:20:07.924 --> 01:20:12.751
<i>Maybe I want to do what
bunnies do with you...</i>

01:20:12.845 --> 01:20:16.345
<i>If you know what I mean...</i>

01:20:18.142 --> 01:20:24.367
<i>Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents'
home in south of France...</i>

01:20:24.858 --> 01:20:27.943
<i>Let's get rich and gale,
everybody nice sweaters...</i>

01:20:27.944 --> 01:20:31.030
<i>...and teach them how
to dance...</i>

01:20:31.781 --> 01:20:34.909
<i>Let's get rich
and build a house...</i>

01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:38.037
<i>...on a mountain, makin' eveybody
look like ants...</i>

01:20:38.747 --> 01:20:44.501
<i>From way up there,
you and I, you and I...</i>

01:20:46.588 --> 01:20:49.673
<i>Well, you might be
a bit confused...</i>

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:53.335
<i>And you might be
a little bit bruised...</i>

01:20:53.512 --> 01:20:58.886
<i>But baby how we spoon
like no one knows...</i>

01:21:00.519 --> 01:21:04.434
<i>So, I will help you read
those books...</i>

01:21:04.565 --> 01:21:08.065
<i>If you will soothe my
worried look...</i>

01:21:08.277 --> 01:21:12.821
<i>And we will put the lonesome
on the shelf...</i>

01:21:15.159 --> 01:21:18.271
<i>Oh, let's get rich
and buy...</i>

01:21:18.272 --> 01:21:21.383
<i>...our parents' home in
south of France...</i>

01:21:21.875 --> 01:21:24.960
<i>Let's get rich and gale
everybody nice sweaters...</i>

01:21:24.961 --> 01:21:28.047
<i>...and teach them how
to dance...</i>

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:31.943
<i>Let's get rich and
build a house...</i>

01:21:31.944 --> 01:21:35.048
<i>...on a mountain makin' everybody
look like ants...</i>

01:21:35.806 --> 01:21:41.227
<i>From way up there,
you and I, you and I...</i>

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:49.704
<i>Let's get rich and buy our parents'
home in south of France...</i>

01:21:50.112 --> 01:21:53.197

01:21:53.199 --> 01:21:56.284
