00:13.666 --> 00:16.596
It was May of 2006 in New York City

00:16.597 --> 00:18.119
and life was good.

00:18.130 --> 00:20.334
But everything was about to change.

00:21.126 --> 00:24.349
So... what do you think?

00:25.261 --> 00:27.457
Robin again?

00:27.458 --> 00:33.085
Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together.

00:33.086 --> 00:36.250
Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.

00:36.251 --> 00:39.611
But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?

00:39.612 --> 00:45.295
Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills.

00:45.315 --> 00:47.551
Anybody else get chills?

00:48.200 --> 00:51.460
Look, I realize we've been down this road before,

00:51.460 --> 00:54.063
but the fact is, whatever I do,

00:54.063 --> 00:56.927
it all keeps coming back to Robin, so...

00:57.166 --> 00:58.703
I gotta do this.

01:00.015 --> 01:01.840
Ow! What the hell?

01:01.848 --> 01:04.321
That wasn't me. That was the universe.

01:05.658 --> 01:10.000
The funny thing was, at that very moment, the universe was working on something--

01:10.006 --> 01:11.401
a storm.

01:11.405 --> 01:15.442
And so tropical storm Willy is going to be with us at least until Monday.

01:15.447 --> 01:18.171
It's gonna rain cats and dogs, folks.

01:18.187 --> 01:20.150
So don't step in a poodle.

01:20.156 --> 01:21.583
Sandy? Robin?

01:21.585 --> 01:22.750
Thanks, Lou.

01:22.756 --> 01:26.851
Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend.

01:26.856 --> 01:30.000
Yeah, but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.651
Guess we'll have to take a rain check.

01:31.655 --> 01:33.872
And we'll check in with you tomorrow, New York.

01:33.876 --> 01:35.380
Have a great night.

01:35.725 --> 01:37.300
And, we're clear.

01:37.307 --> 01:41.480
Bummer. I was hoping to finally have sex with you this weekend, Scherbotsky.

01:41.486 --> 01:44.533
Well, I'd give you the "I don't date coworkers" speech again,

01:44.535 --> 01:47.523
but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now.

01:47.527 --> 01:50.683
Shame, though. It was a pretty hot show tonight.

01:50.686 --> 01:53.770
The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end

01:53.775 --> 01:56.051
really got my freak juice flowing.

01:57.206 --> 02:00.161
Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash

02:00.166 --> 02:02.091
and burn before you say, "enough"?

02:02.097 --> 02:04.110
One more. One more time.

02:04.117 --> 02:06.582
One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture.

02:06.598 --> 02:09.382
And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it.

02:09.386 --> 02:10.793
If it's yes, great.

02:10.795 --> 02:14.131
If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever.

02:14.137 --> 02:17.630
So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?

02:17.635 --> 02:19.873
I am going to make her...

02:20.707 --> 02:22.621
a mix CD.

02:23.776 --> 02:25.340
No, I'm kidding. I got a plan.

02:25.348 --> 02:27.262
Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment.

02:27.266 --> 02:28.892
I see where this is going.

02:28.898 --> 02:33.710
Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work...

02:33.885 --> 02:35.082
usually.

02:35.085 --> 02:37.220
The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999.

02:37.227 --> 02:40.953
The characters: Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name...

02:41.417 --> 02:42.771
Universe.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.990
So, this plan you speak of?

02:45.996 --> 02:48.792
Remember the first night Robin and I went out?

02:48.797 --> 02:52.470
I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.

02:52.478 --> 02:54.971
Yeah. Dude, that was awesome,

02:54.988 --> 02:57.261
but how are you ever going to top that?

03:02.878 --> 03:04.753
She should be here any second.

03:05.155 --> 03:08.411
Uh, we're pretty hungry. When do we get our pizza?

03:08.417 --> 03:11.703
Enough with the-- we'll go get pizza later, all right?

03:11.708 --> 03:13.141
Just...

03:25.518 --> 03:26.852
Damn it.

03:32.997 --> 03:33.850
Hello.

03:33.857 --> 03:38.242
Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key.

03:38.408 --> 03:40.121
Extra key?

03:41.306 --> 03:43.351
Do I have an extra key to your apartment?

03:43.355 --> 03:44.733
Yes, I gave it to you.

03:44.735 --> 03:46.641
Oh, right. That key.

03:46.646 --> 03:48.252
Yeah, I lost it.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.520
Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith.

03:50.526 --> 03:52.621
No, wait, uh...

03:52.745 --> 03:54.682
Maybe you should just knock.

03:54.686 --> 03:56.081
Knock?

03:56.097 --> 03:58.641
Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained.

04:03.806 --> 04:08.683
Hello, Lily, this is Janet Kagan at the Russell House Art Foundation here in San Francisco.

04:08.686 --> 04:12.531
I'm pleased to inform you that we've accepted your application for our summer fellowship.

04:12.537 --> 04:14.691
We look forward to hearing from you. Bye-bye.

04:14.706 --> 04:18.182
Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay?

04:19.928 --> 04:21.831
Summer fellowship?

04:22.178 --> 04:23.581
Just knock.

04:23.598 --> 04:24.983
Okay.

04:31.246 --> 04:32.101
Hi.

04:33.116 --> 04:34.310
Hi.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.563
Robin...

04:46.457 --> 04:47.982
I've sort of said this already.

04:47.985 --> 04:51.962
I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly.

04:52.056 --> 04:54.992
So this is me, just saying it.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.972
With strings.

04:58.018 --> 05:01.552
I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together.

05:01.958 --> 05:03.532
What do you say?

05:12.807 --> 05:14.651
- What do you say?
- Yes.

05:14.655 --> 05:15.881
No.

05:16.095 --> 05:17.461
I don't know.

05:17.515 --> 05:19.143
Those are the three options.

05:19.145 --> 05:21.212
- Ted, this is so...
- I know.

05:21.216 --> 05:26.912
I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and...

05:27.077 --> 05:28.832
I have to pee.

05:29.505 --> 05:31.050
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:31.508 --> 05:34.290
Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait.

05:46.406 --> 05:49.933
Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier, you said there'd be pizza.

05:49.936 --> 05:53.740
No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards.

05:53.745 --> 05:57.781
Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here.

05:57.795 --> 05:59.112
Sure.

06:00.606 --> 06:02.281
We're not getting any pizza.

06:04.695 --> 06:07.881
Okay. Let's talk.

06:07.885 --> 06:09.222
Okay.

06:12.096 --> 06:14.611
Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?

06:15.957 --> 06:17.791
Thanks, guys. Just need a minute.

06:17.795 --> 06:21.140
Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.872
Kind of an inside joke.

06:23.076 --> 06:24.220
Thanks.

06:26.295 --> 06:29.182
- You're crazy.
- Right. Come on.

06:29.187 --> 06:31.643
It's not that I haven't thought about this.

06:31.645 --> 06:33.991
You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay?

06:33.996 --> 06:36.201
We only just started being friends again.

06:36.206 --> 06:39.001
I know. But-- come on.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.691
And we want different things.

06:40.696 --> 06:43.071
That's still there. That's not going away.

06:43.075 --> 06:45.322
I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out

06:45.328 --> 06:47.560
and I'd lose you as a friend?

06:47.567 --> 06:49.291
I gotta think about this.

06:49.296 --> 06:51.701
Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane.

06:51.707 --> 06:53.783
Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious.

06:53.796 --> 06:55.282
I'm kidding. I'm serious.

06:55.297 --> 06:57.732
I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping.

06:57.738 --> 06:59.060
I thought that thing was canceled.

06:59.066 --> 07:00.110
Well, it's back on.

07:00.118 --> 07:01.022
Since when?

07:01.028 --> 07:02.842
Since like an hour ago.

07:02.847 --> 07:06.441
..sending the storm back out into the Atlantic.

07:06.456 --> 07:09.670
So it's blue skies this weekend.

07:09.677 --> 07:11.092
Sandy? Robin?

07:11.097 --> 07:16.500
Thanks, Lou, but that blue sky isn't without at least one cloud.

07:16.515 --> 07:21.261
I'm sorry to announce that one week from today I will be leaving Metro News One.

07:21.346 --> 07:23.750
It has been an honor to bring you the news each night,

07:23.756 --> 07:26.332
and read the paper to you each morning.

07:26.596 --> 07:28.432
I will always treasure it.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.043
Good night, New York.

07:30.218 --> 07:31.871
And we're clear.

07:32.067 --> 07:33.270
You're leaving?

07:33.276 --> 07:35.622
There. I quit my job.

07:35.628 --> 07:39.192
We're not coworkers. Will you please have dinner with me?

07:39.910 --> 07:42.360
I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.973
Oh, congratulations.

07:43.973 --> 07:45.956
Congratulations yourself.

07:45.956 --> 07:46.952
What do you mean?

07:46.958 --> 07:51.410
Well, Joel asked me who I thought should replace me as lead anchor.

07:51.415 --> 07:53.222
I told him you.

07:53.887 --> 07:56.661
They're announcing it next week. Act surprised.

07:56.666 --> 07:58.240
Wow.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.170
Thanks.

08:01.415 --> 08:02.611
And, yes.

08:02.618 --> 08:03.812
Yes, what?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.781
Yes, let's go get dinner.

08:06.765 --> 08:09.373
How about this weekend on the camping trip?

08:09.435 --> 08:11.500
I roast a mean weenie.

08:13.277 --> 08:15.222
Oh, you're kidding me.

08:15.227 --> 08:17.142
No way. Don't go on this thing.

08:17.145 --> 08:19.830
Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip.

08:19.838 --> 08:22.491
Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date.

08:22.498 --> 08:25.192
With Sandy... and his weenie.

08:25.195 --> 08:27.500
I mean is this not a date?

08:27.525 --> 08:29.291
I don't-I don't know.

08:29.298 --> 08:31.980
So, what? You actually like this guy now?

08:31.986 --> 08:33.572
I don't know.

08:33.578 --> 08:34.751
Are you gonna hook up with him?

08:34.758 --> 08:35.722
I don't know.

08:35.726 --> 08:37.842
- Yes, you do.
- No, Ted, I don't.

08:37.847 --> 08:39.852
And you know what? That's okay.

08:39.866 --> 08:42.813
I don't plan out every second of my life like you do.

08:42.815 --> 08:46.372
- I don't plan out every...
- Oh, really? What is all of this?

08:46.377 --> 08:50.162
I mean, why can't you just say, "Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?"

08:50.167 --> 08:55.143
No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates

08:55.148 --> 08:57.871
and let's spend the rest of our lives together.

08:57.877 --> 09:00.732
Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point?

09:00.735 --> 09:03.930
God, you are so terrified of anything real.

09:03.937 --> 09:05.873
It's like you're floating out in space.

09:05.875 --> 09:07.852
Touch the ground, Robin.

09:07.857 --> 09:10.821
Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake.

09:10.826 --> 09:12.803
I need to think about this.

09:12.808 --> 09:14.130
Fine.

09:14.305 --> 09:16.323
No, I'm sorry, I...

09:16.698 --> 09:18.171
I can't do this anymore.

09:18.177 --> 09:19.840
I need an answer.

09:21.147 --> 09:25.413
If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that.

09:25.418 --> 09:29.383
Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no.

09:31.158 --> 09:33.492
Then I guess it's not meant to be.

09:37.295 --> 09:38.693
Nice try, buddy.

09:38.698 --> 09:40.841
Good hustle out there.

09:41.368 --> 09:44.013
Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure.

09:44.018 --> 09:47.092
She's made her choice and you can finally move on.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.881
Screw that. This ain't over.

09:50.186 --> 09:53.452
Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said...

09:53.457 --> 09:55.513
I don't care what I said.

09:55.515 --> 09:58.422
This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be.

09:58.425 --> 10:00.420
It is meant to be, and you know why?

10:00.427 --> 10:02.650
'Cause I mean it to be.

10:06.325 --> 10:07.910
- Unpause?
- Unpause.

10:07.915 --> 10:09.531
Let's pause.

10:09.585 --> 10:13.081
See, Marshall and Lily had a rule that at any point during a fight

10:13.088 --> 10:14.842
they could pause and take a break.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.072
Their fights often lasted for days.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.291
- A painting fellowship?
- I was never going to take it.

10:19.305 --> 10:22.143
- In California?
- I was never going to take it.

10:22.146 --> 10:25.102
Ted, she is going on that camping trip.

10:25.107 --> 10:30.380
Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.

10:31.258 --> 10:32.572
Fine.

10:32.808 --> 10:35.443
If an act of God is what it takes,

10:35.447 --> 10:37.683
then an act of God it is.

10:38.247 --> 10:40.553
What are you talking about?

10:42.038 --> 10:44.142
I'm gonna make it rain.

10:48.757 --> 10:51.031
I can't let Robin go camping with this guy.

10:51.035 --> 10:52.531
So how do I keep that from happening?

10:52.535 --> 10:54.973
Simple-- I make it rain!

10:54.975 --> 10:56.973
Ted, do you want me to slap you again?

10:56.976 --> 10:59.103
'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.

10:59.107 --> 11:00.991
Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what?

11:00.995 --> 11:03.741
I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.513
That girl you used to go out with, Penelope,

11:05.527 --> 11:08.061
wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?

11:08.066 --> 11:08.822
Yeah.

11:08.826 --> 11:09.931
Are you still in touch with her?

11:09.937 --> 11:12.152
Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having sex,

11:12.157 --> 11:14.571
we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up,

11:14.575 --> 11:16.373
and of course I'm not in touch with her!

11:16.378 --> 11:18.572
Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her.

11:18.578 --> 11:21.392
She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.

11:22.297 --> 11:25.571
- Did you just say a "rain dance"?
- Yes.

11:25.856 --> 11:28.201
- A rain dance.
- Yes.

11:28.206 --> 11:31.982
- A dance to make it rain.
- Yes.

11:39.127 --> 11:41.073
- We're finding Penelope!
- No, we are not!

11:41.078 --> 11:42.032
Yes, we are!

11:42.037 --> 11:46.581
Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!

11:47.345 --> 11:49.423
Why the hell should I help you?

11:49.427 --> 11:54.741
Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship.

11:54.745 --> 11:58.023
We had sex twice in your car, and then you dumped me.

11:58.038 --> 12:00.453
How is that a relationship?

12:00.457 --> 12:01.951
Twice!

12:02.308 --> 12:05.170
- Barney, there is no way...
- Shh!

12:05.176 --> 12:07.160
Seriously, come on.

12:08.217 --> 12:11.393
Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend.

12:11.396 --> 12:12.770
Why?

12:12.936 --> 12:14.560
There's this girl...

12:14.565 --> 12:16.323
"There's this girl."

12:16.328 --> 12:20.393
You know, the traditional rain dance is a sacred prayer to nature.

12:20.395 --> 12:25.473
I don't think the Great Spirit looks too kindly on white dudes who co-opt it to get laid.

12:25.476 --> 12:27.102
Penelope, this is the girl I love.

12:27.106 --> 12:30.273
If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy.

12:30.276 --> 12:31.802
Please.

12:33.516 --> 12:36.740
This wrong guy, is he a huge jackass?

12:36.746 --> 12:37.722
Absolutely.

12:37.726 --> 12:39.181
- Kind of like Barney?
- Kind of.

12:39.197 --> 12:40.951
- Hey.
- You hit on my mom!

12:40.957 --> 12:42.803
We weren't exclusive!

12:44.775 --> 12:45.963
I'm in.

12:45.967 --> 12:48.803
And so the three of us headed up to the roof of my building.

12:48.806 --> 12:49.973
Okay.

12:50.308 --> 12:52.571
Crouch down and bend over a little bit.

12:52.577 --> 12:55.610
Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position.

12:55.786 --> 12:58.482
I will throw you off this roof.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.610
There's so much of your mom in you.

13:03.807 --> 13:06.041
And she's been throwing up ever since.

13:06.045 --> 13:08.683
So how'd she manage to eat so much chocolate?

13:08.885 --> 13:12.250
Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about?

13:12.267 --> 13:15.183
Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment

13:15.185 --> 13:17.670
with a string quartet and roses and chocolates...

13:17.688 --> 13:20.540
Oh, that's so sweet.

13:20.556 --> 13:24.600
Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy?

13:24.616 --> 13:28.811
I mean, a string quartet in my living room-- who does that?

13:28.817 --> 13:30.113
Nobody does that.

13:30.117 --> 13:31.262
Exactly.

13:31.267 --> 13:34.410
No, honey-- nobody does that.

13:35.727 --> 13:38.521
But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic.

13:38.526 --> 13:41.121
I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now.

13:43.288 --> 13:46.053
So you're saying you would forbid me from going?

13:46.055 --> 13:47.833
Forbid? Who said forbid?

13:47.837 --> 13:50.983
I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months,

13:50.986 --> 13:52.872
and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day.

13:52.876 --> 13:55.530
Look for me-- I'll be the guy in the awesome suit.

13:55.545 --> 13:58.241
Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted.

13:58.245 --> 14:03.092
Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them.

14:03.656 --> 14:08.600
I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever.

14:08.605 --> 14:12.401
So now we've gone from "I was never gonna do it" to "I need to do this"?

14:12.407 --> 14:14.450
Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?

14:14.456 --> 14:16.350
Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.332
I never said that!

14:18.336 --> 14:19.962
You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now,

14:19.968 --> 14:21.431
what's gonna change in three months?

14:21.437 --> 14:22.741
Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.

14:22.756 --> 14:24.152
Maybe not.

14:26.638 --> 14:28.130
- Pause.
- Pause.

14:28.775 --> 14:31.523
- So, are you just, like, starving?
- Totally.

14:31.525 --> 14:32.860
Red Lobster?

14:33.565 --> 14:37.122
Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious!

14:37.126 --> 14:40.661
Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it.

14:40.668 --> 14:43.141
Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.922
I wouldn't dare.

14:45.307 --> 14:48.380
Marshall, no. We're on pause.

14:48.386 --> 14:50.830
There's no crying in Pauseland!

14:50.837 --> 14:53.041
Pauseland is a magical place, with--

14:53.048 --> 14:56.741
with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers!

14:57.665 --> 14:59.093
Damn it!

14:59.175 --> 15:01.641
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy birthday,

15:01.698 --> 15:04.170
happy, happy, happy, happy, appy, happy birthday,

15:04.176 --> 15:05.402
happy, happy...

15:14.018 --> 15:15.652
Ted, this is funny.

15:16.265 --> 15:17.720
Still funny.

15:18.355 --> 15:21.720
Still fu... And now it's sad.

15:22.336 --> 15:25.340
Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?

15:25.348 --> 15:26.633
I think so.

15:27.165 --> 15:30.461
Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance?

15:30.466 --> 15:32.100
I think so.

15:32.406 --> 15:37.762
Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?

15:38.177 --> 15:39.362
No.

15:41.277 --> 15:42.171
No?

15:42.177 --> 15:43.770
I've read extensively on the subject:

15:43.776 --> 15:46.542
firsthand accounts, theoretical criticism, the anthropological...

15:46.547 --> 15:49.851
Have you ever seen a rain dance?

15:50.045 --> 15:52.371
I've seen a film strip.

15:52.375 --> 15:54.083
Terrific. Uh, look, I should run.

15:54.087 --> 15:57.730
I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R.

15:57.737 --> 15:59.341
I can't believe this.

15:59.347 --> 16:02.461
We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves.

16:02.468 --> 16:04.782
What do you mean "we," white man?

16:08.205 --> 16:10.301
How did we get here?

16:10.935 --> 16:13.323
Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was,

16:13.336 --> 16:16.672
did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge.

16:16.678 --> 16:18.593
I think there's still one left.

16:18.736 --> 16:20.222
Dibs.

16:23.707 --> 16:26.361
- Unpause?
- Unpause.

16:27.185 --> 16:30.511
Look... I know this sucks.

16:30.517 --> 16:33.221
It's just something I'm going through.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.763
I'm not asking you to understand it.

16:35.766 --> 16:38.211
I'm not asking you to be happy about it.

16:38.687 --> 16:41.271
I'm just asking you to support it.

16:43.495 --> 16:45.941
I want to, Lily, okay?

16:45.976 --> 16:47.782
I really do.

16:47.846 --> 16:49.841
But I just can't.

16:49.846 --> 16:50.530
Why not?

16:50.537 --> 16:53.463
Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not.

16:53.688 --> 16:55.582
What if you decide to go be a painter

16:55.586 --> 16:57.682
and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore,

16:57.688 --> 16:59.891
and three months becomes forever?

16:59.906 --> 17:02.571
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?

17:02.988 --> 17:03.921
Marshall...

17:03.925 --> 17:06.080
'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now.

17:06.086 --> 17:09.342
I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out.

17:11.738 --> 17:13.880
Marshall, I love you.

17:14.955 --> 17:17.642
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?

17:17.645 --> 17:19.901
- Pause.
- No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore.

17:19.907 --> 17:21.731
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?!

17:21.738 --> 17:23.760
- Pause!
- Why do you want me to pause?!

17:27.068 --> 17:29.433
That's just a great use of the pause function, baby.

17:29.436 --> 17:30.630
Thank you.

17:36.826 --> 17:38.491
Hey, Ted.

17:38.495 --> 17:40.310
Whatcha doing?

17:40.317 --> 17:41.973
A rain dance.

17:41.985 --> 17:46.751
Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.

17:46.758 --> 17:50.090
Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography.

17:50.096 --> 17:51.953
It's the thought that counts.

17:51.998 --> 17:54.741
She's leaving in half an hour.

17:56.755 --> 18:00.413
These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl.

18:00.417 --> 18:01.790
This isn't gonna work!

18:01.795 --> 18:03.510
Yeah. I know that.

18:03.517 --> 18:06.613
- Well, then why are you doing this?
- Because I love her.

18:06.615 --> 18:07.980
I love her!

18:07.988 --> 18:09.542
I told her that the first night we went out,

18:09.546 --> 18:12.592
and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed.

18:12.597 --> 18:15.661
So yes, I know this isn't gonna work.

18:15.665 --> 18:17.700
But it has to work!

18:17.995 --> 18:20.060
You hear me, universe?

18:20.068 --> 18:22.812
This is Ted Mosby talking!

18:22.816 --> 18:24.910
Give me some rain!

18:25.785 --> 18:27.361
Come on!

18:28.295 --> 18:30.151
Come on!

18:30.657 --> 18:32.943
Come on...!

18:36.237 --> 18:38.603
Oh, come on!

18:51.198 --> 18:54.233
Pushing the front back into the Tri-State area

18:54.236 --> 18:58.380
and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.973
How about that? He did it.

19:21.945 --> 19:24.812
Robin! Hey, Robin!

19:31.055 --> 19:32.963
Oh, thank God you're here!

19:32.966 --> 19:35.151
My camping trip got rained out.

19:35.166 --> 19:36.960
I know. I'm sorry.

19:36.965 --> 19:39.800
- It's not your fault.
- Yeah, it is.

19:39.806 --> 19:41.081
Come down here.

19:41.087 --> 19:43.232
It's pouring. You come up.

19:43.238 --> 19:45.412
No, you have to come down here.

19:45.997 --> 19:47.931
- Why?
- Why?

19:47.936 --> 19:51.163
Because I made it rain, that's what I did today!

19:51.176 --> 19:55.582
And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!

19:55.657 --> 19:58.641
I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up.

19:58.646 --> 20:01.100
I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not.

20:01.107 --> 20:03.661
You have to come down here!

20:22.287 --> 20:24.441
- I was gonna...
- I know.

20:43.147 --> 20:45.900
And that's how Robin and I ended up together.

20:45.908 --> 20:48.960
Turns out, all I had to do was make it rain.

20:49.096 --> 20:52.192
As I rode home the next morning, the city looked the same,

20:52.195 --> 20:55.220
the people looked the same. It all looked the same.

20:55.226 --> 20:56.742
But it wasn't.

20:56.746 --> 21:00.320
In just one night, everything had changed.
