00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
GERMAN ANGST

03:24.500 --> 03:28.935
FINAL GIRL

04:02.380 --> 04:06.322
My guinea pig Mucki lost fingers.

04:06.372 --> 04:08.697
I don't know how it happened.

04:08.800 --> 04:14.639
One morning, when I went 
to feed her, they were gone.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.175
The wounds could not heal by 
themselves...

04:19.180 --> 04:21.640
It is given that the bone 
was exposed.

04:21.648 --> 04:25.110
There was not enough tissue 
to suture the wound,

04:25.115 --> 04:27.832
said the vet.

04:32.300 --> 04:37.424
So they had to amputate 
the whole leg.

04:38.299 --> 04:42.491
I asked that they only 
amputated to the knee,

04:42.541 --> 04:45.642
but the vet said it was not 
a good idea,

04:45.692 --> 04:49.734
because he would not be able 
to walk on the stump.

04:52.075 --> 04:56.809
Many veterinarians avoid doing 
this kind of operation,

04:56.830 --> 05:01.343
because guinea pigs don't 
heal easily.

05:03.576 --> 05:05.758
But the wound is healed...

05:05.760 --> 05:10.560
And Mucki lives well even 
with only three legs.

06:56.519 --> 06:58.294
Near Potsdamer Platz,

06:58.296 --> 07:03.510
a man killed and dismembered his wife 
in front of her six children.

07:03.519 --> 07:08.650
Police found the body of a woman of 
about 30 years, on the 5th floor...

07:08.653 --> 07:12.345
of a building inhabited mostly by 
Turkish and Arab families.

07:12.483 --> 07:18.520
The neighbors called the police at 13:15 
when they heard a loud quarrel.

07:18.545 --> 07:23.300
Angry, Hakan 32, attacked his wife, Zeynep,

07:23.304 --> 07:26.230
on the roof terrace, where they were arguing

07:26.235 --> 07:30.576
before decapitating her and 
throwing her head in the garden.

07:30.585 --> 07:33.093
Then he cut her right breast,

07:33.096 --> 07:37.347
while shouting "Allahu Akbar", 
God is great.

07:37.397 --> 07:40.925
According to a police spokesman, 
the man was immediately arrested

07:40.930 --> 07:43.531
although he resisted.

07:43.557 --> 07:48.239
The police did not release information 
about his religion.

07:48.255 --> 07:53.248
The man of Turkish origin was 
declared mentally ill...

07:53.298 --> 07:55.381
and he was interned in a 
psychiatric clinic

07:55.400 --> 08:00.198
"I thought I was Jesus and she 
was the devil," he said in court.

08:00.200 --> 08:03.544
Now his children, two girls 
and four boys,

08:03.549 --> 08:07.103
receive psychological care 
in an orphanage.

08:07.110 --> 08:11.766
The children, aged between 1 and 13 years, 
were physically unharmed.

08:11.825 --> 08:15.405
According to neighbors, the man 
met often with his mistress...

08:15.408 --> 08:18.515
who lived in the same house 
with her two children.

08:18.517 --> 08:21.997
His wife threatened him with divorce

08:22.000 --> 08:26.242
which then it turned into quarrel 
and murder.

08:26.325 --> 08:31.665
The man had been under investigation 
for tax evasion,

08:31.668 --> 08:34.923
and various traffic violations.

08:34.926 --> 08:39.543
However it has a history of violent 
crimes, police said.

08:39.592 --> 08:42.844
Now we change the subject...

10:27.077 --> 10:32.752
The castration of a male guinea pig 
is the eradication of the testicles.

10:32.790 --> 10:37.711
The surgery under anesthesia is 
practiced by a veterinarian.

10:37.761 --> 10:41.336
This is very stressful for 
the animals,

10:41.339 --> 10:45.003
therefore it must be done 
very carefully.

11:56.625 --> 12:01.485
After surgery, the wound can be 
sutured or left open.

12:01.487 --> 12:04.955
Open wounds heal much faster,

12:04.959 --> 12:08.826
but there is a greater risk of infection.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.130
The operation takes only 20 minutes,

12:32.136 --> 12:36.480
but then it must be supervised 
by a veterinarian...

12:36.487 --> 12:41.551
Not all apply anesthesia, as 
some guinea pigs die from it,

12:41.554 --> 12:45.387
and they may even die after surgery.

12:47.871 --> 12:50.897
It can also form an abscess...

12:50.900 --> 12:54.121
and it should be treated with antibiotics.

12:54.175 --> 13:01.022
But they can weaken the animal.

13:04.200 --> 13:08.625
After castration, the animal 
often loses it's appetite...

13:08.631 --> 13:12.040
and it undergoes some changes 
in behavior.

21:34.504 --> 21:37.971
I am Jesus and you are the devil.

22:25.883 --> 22:29.033
Many animals don't like to be touched.

22:29.083 --> 22:32.596
When I stroke my guinea pig, he looks up...

22:32.600 --> 22:39.517
because he wants to be left alone. 
It's a warning.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.704
Guinea pigs don't like the caresses.

22:43.709 --> 22:47.734
Often we misunderstand this behavior.

22:48.776 --> 22:53.835
Before, when I took her to bed with me, 
he wrapped himself around my neck.

22:53.840 --> 22:57.919
I thought he liked to be hugged.

22:58.169 --> 23:01.444
But it remained still only...

23:01.452 --> 23:04.386
to be disturbed as little as possible.

23:04.400 --> 23:09.878
Actually only he wanted to 
get back in his cage.

23:18.079 --> 23:20.200
My guinea pig is easy to take care of,

23:20.204 --> 23:24.612
now he realized that he can not escape.

23:24.762 --> 23:28.238
He is resigned to his inevitable fate...

23:28.250 --> 23:33.063
He knows that I don't care whether 
he is in pain or not.

25:59.424 --> 26:02.475
Wait, you fool. 
Let me catch my breath.

26:03.025 --> 26:07.375
- You look like a savage.
- You don't need air, you have me!

26:35.327 --> 26:36.786
Let's explore.

27:27.665 --> 27:30.007
Let's go there.

27:40.500 --> 27:48.500
MAKE A WISH

27:50.066 --> 27:52.950
It's huge!

28:57.530 --> 29:00.372
It's beautiful... What is it?

29:01.122 --> 29:05.747
It is an old story.

29:06.197 --> 29:11.073
It's a magical amulet that can 
protect you.

30:39.980 --> 30:44.010
Come on! Move! Faster!

30:44.022 --> 30:48.255
Move your ass! Quickly! Quickly!

30:50.733 --> 30:52.397
Now!

30:55.281 --> 30:57.339
Leave me!

30:58.389 --> 31:04.615
Come on, come on... Get moving.

31:04.645 --> 31:06.057
Move!

31:07.482 --> 31:10.715
Go up, come on! Faster!

31:13.599 --> 31:17.491
- Good.
- Come on, grandpa!

31:17.541 --> 31:20.591
Good. Get back.

31:20.741 --> 31:23.100
Shut up! Calm down!

31:30.434 --> 31:31.900
Hush!

31:45.143 --> 31:47.285
Come! Come!

31:48.655 --> 31:50.585
You are a criminal!

32:09.625 --> 32:13.037
Shut your mouth, Polish whore!

32:42.581 --> 32:44.331
Stop!

32:49.056 --> 32:50.557
Stop!

32:51.482 --> 32:53.182
Stop!

33:03.633 --> 33:05.475
Where are you going?

33:06.900 --> 33:08.700
Where are you going?

33:09.111 --> 33:11.533
Yes, it is beautiful.

33:34.735 --> 33:38.485
- What is that?
- Is it for us?

35:28.350 --> 35:33.769
- No... 
- Quiet, it doesn't end there.

35:34.719 --> 35:35.725
Look there!

35:35.728 --> 35:41.070
There is nothing more moving 
than a pair of sweethearts.

35:48.204 --> 35:49.500
Ciao!

35:49.522 --> 35:51.475
Fantastic.

35:51.522 --> 35:53.490
They would like popcorn.

35:53.500 --> 35:55.563
It seems a dream.

35:56.170 --> 35:58.200
How about it, Hilda?

35:58.213 --> 36:00.960
- What does she know about it?
- Shut up, you idiot!

36:00.963 --> 36:05.325
We have to speak English, remember?

36:05.330 --> 36:08.814
We don't want to change before our friend.

36:11.789 --> 36:17.631
What a wonderful day. 
Can I sit and rest a bit?

36:23.133 --> 36:25.548
Can't you speak in english?

36:27.422 --> 36:29.765
Don't you know how to?

36:29.915 --> 36:35.515
You don't even know to say "hello", 
or "I'm sorry"? Say something, anything.

36:35.655 --> 36:39.499
Otherwise, we will make you talk.

36:41.325 --> 36:43.675
I got it?

36:44.825 --> 36:46.598
We can not talk.

36:46.600 --> 36:49.000
What the fuck!

36:49.258 --> 36:53.109
- They are both deaf mute.
- No.

36:53.133 --> 36:55.451
Muti?

36:56.971 --> 36:59.159
Deaf?

37:00.209 --> 37:02.335
Both?

37:03.460 --> 37:07.960
- You know how to read lips?
- My God!

37:09.352 --> 37:14.985
Your guy can read my lips?

37:15.414 --> 37:18.186
You're disgusting, fuck!

37:18.236 --> 37:20.528
Read my lips.

37:26.945 --> 37:31.222
- You make me sick.
- Yes, right.

37:31.228 --> 37:34.920
- What did he say?
- "What did he say?"

37:39.054 --> 37:43.071
They know how to write! 
They know how to write!

37:45.500 --> 37:50.388
This is my first letter from a deaf-mute. 
Exciting.

37:50.438 --> 37:54.100
No, not really. I'm leaving.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.305
Go to hell, it's exciting.

37:56.355 --> 38:00.897
"Please, we don't want trouble."

38:02.814 --> 38:07.325
I decide who should and who
does not have problems.

38:07.340 --> 38:09.882
This is my territory.

38:10.082 --> 38:11.282
Mine.

38:11.632 --> 38:16.840
You think you can come here 
and have fun?

38:17.032 --> 38:21.782
And this? You think I'm kidding?

38:22.332 --> 38:26.541
What is this? 
Who do you think you are?

38:26.691 --> 38:29.966
Bitch... please.

38:32.425 --> 38:36.230
- Don't even think about moving.
- Don't be a hero!

38:36.233 --> 38:39.129
- What's the matter?
- There's a hero here!

38:39.134 --> 38:41.651
Yup? A fucking hero?

38:41.751 --> 38:44.951
Frisk them.

38:46.843 --> 38:50.760
Let's see... What have we here?

38:52.460 --> 38:59.923
Jacek Falecki. A Polish bastard.

38:59.935 --> 39:03.135
And you, pussy?

39:04.094 --> 39:09.378
Kasia Bi... Bi... Biedryczynka.

39:09.410 --> 39:11.867
I can't even pronounce this shit name.

39:11.870 --> 39:13.410
No wonder you're dumb.

39:13.412 --> 39:17.412
It's an invasion of dirty Poles?

39:17.500 --> 39:19.470
- Well, I am Polish? 
- Yes.

39:19.471 --> 39:23.614
- You fucking Polish? 
- Yes. - No, shit! No!

39:23.621 --> 39:25.360
I hate them!

39:25.363 --> 39:29.098
I left England because of them!
They are like an infection!

39:29.100 --> 39:31.819
They take our jobs! Bastards!

39:31.821 --> 39:36.888
- Kill them, fuck.
- Calm down, man. Calm down.

39:38.088 --> 39:39.991
We have not yet begun.

39:39.997 --> 39:43.505
What are you doing here in our country?

39:43.507 --> 39:49.839
- This is Germany. Germany!
- Yes!

39:50.000 --> 39:52.400
All right. Ok.

39:54.797 --> 39:57.197
The tension is unbearable.

39:59.057 --> 40:03.749
"We were born and raised here. 
We are Germans."

40:03.800 --> 40:08.474
Do you understand? They are Germans. 
Very well.

40:08.500 --> 40:10.874
Now I feel much better.

40:10.950 --> 40:13.000
Now we will do a test.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.845
It's not a joke.

40:15.850 --> 40:20.450
It's to see if you 
are really Germans.

40:22.450 --> 40:29.442
If you pass the test, we'll go and
not give you any more trouble.

40:29.492 --> 40:35.343
You simply need to sing 
the German national anthem.

40:38.596 --> 40:42.518
- I can not hear anything! Can you?
- No.

40:42.568 --> 40:44.977
You must just be shy.

40:45.100 --> 40:46.600
Are you ready?

40:46.627 --> 40:49.811
Begin! I can't hear anything!

40:49.861 --> 40:53.086
Sing! don't write.

40:58.078 --> 41:00.300
It's really brave.

41:07.024 --> 41:09.190
What did they write?

41:09.200 --> 41:13.671
"Fuck you, Nazi motherfuckers."

41:14.465 --> 41:18.965
"Fuck you, Nazi motherfuckers."

41:22.380 --> 41:24.630
Does it seem funny?

41:24.655 --> 41:27.080
Oh, fuck!

41:28.805 --> 41:32.397
There's no hero, but we 
have a heroine!

41:32.447 --> 41:36.906
Polish bastards! We already 
defeated you once before!

41:37.500 --> 41:41.273
Keep the son of a bitch there, 
I want you to look.

41:45.637 --> 41:49.482
Isn't she beautiful? 

41:50.450 --> 41:51.855
Yes!

41:51.882 --> 41:54.482
Troy!

41:56.900 --> 41:59.200
Hit it! Again!

41:59.864 --> 42:05.858
Excuse me, I didn't understand you.
Do you want some paper?

42:06.167 --> 42:10.459
Yes! Yes! Yes!

42:10.559 --> 42:12.477
Again!

42:12.481 --> 42:15.334
Get up, Polish cunt!

42:23.200 --> 42:28.727
Now comes the best part.

42:35.694 --> 42:39.702
- Did you have fun?
- Yes a lot.

43:18.839 --> 43:20.689
Jens!

43:27.981 --> 43:32.282
Are you stupid or deaf?

43:34.210 --> 43:36.290
What's happening to you?

43:46.215 --> 43:49.015
It means something.

43:49.433 --> 43:51.558
What's happening to you?

43:52.865 --> 43:54.997
We have no time for your 
fucking letters.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.009
No! No!
Please, give him some paper.

44:03.717 --> 44:08.209
Don't do that! 
You're scaring me!

44:11.750 --> 44:15.393
- Show him.
- "I'm Jens."

44:15.400 --> 44:19.827
- I don't understand. What the
fuck does that mean? "I'm Jens!"

44:24.788 --> 44:28.878
Brilliant, man! 
You could be an actor!

44:30.700 --> 44:35.130
Hello, Jens. I am Joseph Goebbels!

44:35.137 --> 44:38.350
And this is getting boring. 
What do we do with her?

44:38.353 --> 44:45.587
We'll take you to the land of pain!

44:57.137 --> 44:58.980
Hey, Jens.

45:00.655 --> 45:03.780
Come on, wake the fuck up. 
Wake up.

45:03.800 --> 45:06.400
Bring her.

45:23.900 --> 45:26.474
What's wrong with Jens, Hilda?

45:26.500 --> 45:29.400
I have no idea, he's always been strange.

45:29.866 --> 45:32.699
- What do you want?
- Come on! Walk!

45:32.730 --> 45:37.033
Walk! Go! Move!

45:37.900 --> 45:41.992
Sit down, now! Sit down!

45:44.975 --> 45:50.142
Are you done spitting? 
Watch your little girlfriend.

45:51.642 --> 45:53.442
Hey...

46:08.650 --> 46:11.011
How are you?

46:12.445 --> 46:18.925
He's starting to like it.
How about you?

46:21.945 --> 46:26.090
You're never going to get out 
of here... Over my dead body.

46:26.100 --> 46:30.545
- Hallelujah! He speaks! 
- Jens? Hey, you all right?

46:30.596 --> 46:32.329
Yes.

46:32.996 --> 46:35.404
Are you...

46:44.622 --> 46:47.539
Stop hitting him!

46:48.830 --> 46:51.880
Your bitch likes it!

46:51.931 --> 46:54.122
Give me the rag.

47:17.399 --> 47:21.725
Darren... there is a game,

47:21.733 --> 47:26.808
we did as children.

47:27.440 --> 47:30.450
It's called "The Hot Seat".

47:31.867 --> 47:37.717
Hold him down on the ground.

47:43.575 --> 47:46.093
Now I throw it over.

47:51.819 --> 47:56.827
Three, two, one... Go!

48:03.555 --> 48:09.878
I... I feel... so comfortable!

48:24.088 --> 48:28.100
I don't think you'll be writing
for a while, motherfucker.

48:28.105 --> 48:30.747
Motherfucker!

48:37.539 --> 48:41.147
Action!

48:48.300 --> 48:51.555
- Is this the English method?
- I don't know.

48:51.565 --> 48:55.982
English, Russian, Chinese, whatever. 
Pain is international.

48:56.032 --> 48:58.415
...his bones.

49:06.958 --> 49:13.908
You want to try it too?
Do you want more blood?

49:14.200 --> 49:20.892
Hit him! Hit him! Do it 
or I'll kill you!

49:26.059 --> 49:30.818
You have to bury him.

49:48.711 --> 49:52.661
- It has a fucking Polish eagle.
- Eagle?

49:53.770 --> 49:58.620
He flew away from him.

49:58.700 --> 50:01.137
Come, look at this.

50:04.245 --> 50:07.671
- This is art, man. 
- Beautiful.

50:41.507 --> 50:46.682
You can scream all you 
want here in Germany.

50:48.424 --> 50:53.980
- Well done. Bravo. 
- The bitch is still alive. Good morning!

50:53.983 --> 50:55.633
Wait.

51:00.758 --> 51:05.159
- What are you doing? 
- I?

51:07.959 --> 51:11.201
You have a choice.

51:11.651 --> 51:17.993
A choice? No, I haven't.

51:27.888 --> 51:33.936
Polish dirty son of a bitch.

52:37.875 --> 52:42.502
Look at him. His face.

52:43.975 --> 52:47.225
I'm sure you would want 
to trade places with me.

52:47.250 --> 52:50.934
But it's impossible.

52:53.425 --> 52:59.843
Why we don't ask. 
We don't explain.

53:01.251 --> 53:03.818
We just know...

53:03.900 --> 53:06.700
that you are the victim...

53:07.293 --> 53:10.293
and you will be executed.

53:12.169 --> 53:15.935
You have nothing to complain about.

53:16.086 --> 53:19.486
Today is your day.

53:20.900 --> 53:23.878
I will not have mercy...

53:25.010 --> 53:27.328
compassion,

53:28.260 --> 53:31.062
comprehension...

53:31.853 --> 53:34.395
and martyrdom.

53:36.187 --> 53:39.812
I'll be despised!

53:40.362 --> 53:43.338
I'll be hated!

53:45.580 --> 53:50.238
I am what I am...

53:50.288 --> 53:53.780
and I will drag this 
guilt with me!

53:53.830 --> 53:57.530
Everywhere I go!

54:00.625 --> 54:07.625
For him... everything will end 
with a happy silence.

54:09.315 --> 54:15.848
And for me... my nightmare is
only beginning.

54:18.932 --> 54:24.932
For those who believe that 
it is easier?

54:32.080 --> 54:34.333
Bye Bye.

54:49.760 --> 54:52.760
Come on, baby!

54:54.000 --> 54:55.644
Bye Bye!

54:55.650 --> 54:58.370
We must finish what we started.

54:58.380 --> 55:03.102
- I will help you to turn it on.
- Yes! Yes!

55:09.211 --> 55:11.211
- Shit! 
- Again!

55:29.746 --> 55:32.864
How are you now, you fucking Polack?

55:32.871 --> 55:37.038
Yes!

55:44.275 --> 55:47.047
Fuck you!

56:20.955 --> 56:26.467
- Now let's have a beer. 
- Come on!

58:39.627 --> 58:42.840
When I talk about these events,

58:42.845 --> 58:46.395
I am never sure if they are real...

58:47.103 --> 58:53.087
or sick dreams that go 
through my brain.

59:02.500 --> 59:06.200
Mandragola

59:28.898 --> 59:32.282
- Have you heard?
- What?

59:35.565 --> 59:38.007
That sound.

59:39.257 --> 59:45.099
Love, You just imagined it. 
What's happening?

59:49.500 --> 59:55.300
- You don't believe me, Maya.
- It's OK.

59:59.367 --> 01:00:00.842
Fine...

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.600
He began...

01:00:04.642 --> 01:00:08.284
the day, when you left me.

01:00:08.534 --> 01:00:10.299
Maya, you misunderstand.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:14.283
What kind of artist would photograph 
the tits of a prostitute?

01:00:14.285 --> 01:00:15.499
It's just work.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.597
Come on, it's a model. 
It's my job.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.241
- Eden, we are ready. 
- don't talk, Eden.

01:00:20.244 --> 01:00:21.092
Maya, please.

01:00:21.094 --> 01:00:24.260
- You can discuss it later. 
- There is a stain.

01:00:24.261 --> 01:00:25.909
Think about it.

01:00:25.911 --> 01:00:30.108
- We can talk about this later? I have to work.
- Where do I put the bottle?

01:00:30.111 --> 01:00:30.935
Wait a moment.

01:00:30.936 --> 01:00:33.685
Don't worry. 
You have all the time you want.

01:00:33.686 --> 01:00:36.895
- Maya, dammit, listen. 
- You won't miss me.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.868
I've never been important.

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:42.710
Cornelson wants that bottle in the frame.

01:00:42.712 --> 01:00:48.202
Sr. Helmut Newton, can your little 
assistant put it there?

01:00:48.204 --> 01:00:52.813
I know a perfect place for the bottle.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.990
"Photo Art" called me 
the magician of the camera.

01:00:59.997 --> 01:01:03.850
But in those days 
I felt only a hollow man.

01:01:03.855 --> 01:01:06.652
No more awards, only bottles.

01:01:06.656 --> 01:01:11.190
And all because of you, love. 
I had to stop thinking about you.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.995
- I had to... 
- Call the Samaritans.

01:01:13.998 --> 01:01:15.498
Exactly.

01:01:16.165 --> 01:01:18.615
I did a little research.

01:01:21.107 --> 01:01:26.057
I ended up in a blog, 
where I met her.

01:01:29.874 --> 01:01:33.674
"Snow White. The love and 
pleasure are incompatible?"

01:01:34.583 --> 01:01:37.430
Love is in the program, 
the pleasure is the malware.

01:01:37.438 --> 01:01:38.420
Yes.

01:01:38.423 --> 01:01:41.770
It was a very bad idea.

01:01:41.775 --> 01:01:45.850
"How about escire tonight?"

01:01:45.855 --> 01:01:47.359
ENTER

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:52.142
Don't be shy.

01:01:52.192 --> 01:01:54.084
"Seriously?"

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.335
You bet.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:03.660
"Been to the club Mabuse? 23:00? 
It's a fun place." - Yes.

01:02:05.843 --> 01:02:10.052
"I know where it is, but I've never 
been there. I haven't had time."

01:02:11.544 --> 01:02:13.727
"How do I confess?"

01:02:14.377 --> 01:02:16.503
Relaxed, and wearing good clothes.

01:02:16.575 --> 01:02:18.311
"I'll recognize you".

01:02:19.255 --> 01:02:23.270
The club was far from the tourist centers.

01:02:26.985 --> 01:02:28.754
Goodbye!

01:02:29.095 --> 01:02:33.762
I felt like an old man, 
not to mention the clothes.

01:02:35.257 --> 01:02:38.071
Okay, you can go.
Have fun.

01:03:15.032 --> 01:03:18.199
It would be, if it was
possible to find her...

01:03:19.233 --> 01:03:22.158
or at least, I thought.

01:03:55.345 --> 01:03:59.302
He caught my attention.

01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:18.871
- Hello, I'm Eden. 
- Pleasure. I am Kira.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.877
- I like your accent. 
- I like your looks.

01:04:25.879 --> 01:04:27.379
Thank you.

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:31.322
- Russian? 
- Ukraine.

01:05:06.016 --> 01:05:11.625
- Have you danced with her? 
- Yes sure.

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:16.633
Danced, talked, drank...

01:06:01.454 --> 01:06:03.595
"Snow White"

01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:09.721
You were right. I recognized
you as soon as I saw her.

01:06:11.688 --> 01:06:17.088
I knew that God would send
someone to save my soul.

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:35.473
Bad girl.

01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:01.075
Sorry.

01:07:16.276 --> 01:07:17.818
Roll it up.

01:07:33.402 --> 01:07:36.219
Do you want to save my soul?

01:07:51.325 --> 01:07:53.740
You don't have to enter my world.

01:07:53.746 --> 01:07:57.829
It's too late. 
They are already in your world.

01:08:02.255 --> 01:08:06.138
Stop... Stop.

01:08:39.991 --> 01:08:41.991
SNOW WHITE

01:08:42.041 --> 01:08:47.075
You only knew her for a few minutes,
and you ran after her.

01:08:47.850 --> 01:08:50.250
Something dragged us...

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:53.770
like a magnet.

01:10:02.572 --> 01:10:04.406
Kira?

01:10:14.195 --> 01:10:16.295
A latecomer invited.

01:10:17.724 --> 01:10:22.207
Hi, this is Eden. A friend of Kira.

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.898
- I saw you in the club, Eden. 
- Saw?

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.500
Yes. You glowed in the darkness.

01:10:29.655 --> 01:10:33.300
Yes, I had an appointment 
there tonight.

01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:35.800
But unfortunately it was
interrupted.

01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:40.398
Yes. And now you want to finish 
it, don't you?

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.900
Yes.

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.700
But I'm afraid you can't here.

01:10:44.701 --> 01:10:47.265
This place is reserved for members.

01:10:47.268 --> 01:10:51.768
No problem. I can become a member.

01:10:52.401 --> 01:10:55.435
And what would you be willing 
to give in return?

01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:01.719
I am the best photographer in Berlin. 
My photos are really striking.

01:11:02.244 --> 01:11:05.208
Accept me as your teacher.

01:11:05.211 --> 01:11:09.034
And be prepared to do things
that may be considered crazy

01:11:09.036 --> 01:11:11.236
during the day.

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:17.436
Sometimes when you enter, 
you can not leave.

01:11:21.437 --> 01:11:27.029
You are right.
It would be madness to accept that.

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:29.560
I was just kidding.

01:11:32.188 --> 01:11:34.288
Good night.

01:11:36.713 --> 01:11:39.522
Kira greet your part.

01:11:39.570 --> 01:11:43.214
The man was harmless. 
Do you understand?

01:11:43.764 --> 01:11:46.530
It's OK. I Agree.

01:11:49.164 --> 01:11:51.406
Then you have to kiss me.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:13.664
You're telling me, the price is a 
kiss to be part of that secret club?

01:12:13.666 --> 01:12:17.904
It sounds ridiculous, you don't
believe a word of what I say.

01:12:17.916 --> 01:12:19.333
You are right.

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:21.133
Continue...

01:12:21.618 --> 01:12:24.118
I should have been warned.

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:26.937
But it was as if I knew 
what was coming.

01:12:26.942 --> 01:12:34.368
As if that place... 
I was waiting for it.

01:12:54.702 --> 01:12:59.245
People my age prefer "Sunflowers" 
by Van Gogh.

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:03.275
But I confess that I prefer 
wet vaginas more.

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:09.440
- Cleo.
- Who's your new friend?

01:13:09.445 --> 01:13:13.777
My dear "Rose of Jericho", don't 
forget that tonight it's my turn.

01:13:13.779 --> 01:13:16.922
Do you want to save it
for another evening?

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:19.688
According to the script, 
I am a reasonable woman.

01:13:19.738 --> 01:13:26.400
Cleo is a TV producer. The man 
beside him is a famous biologist.

01:13:26.405 --> 01:13:32.405
Genetically modifies plants. 
It improves their nature.

01:13:43.473 --> 01:13:48.572
- He belongs to this place, Peter. 
- I know.

01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:51.800
Sorry, science calls.

01:13:52.055 --> 01:13:58.091
I don't think they were Puritans. He 
could tell something was going to happen.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:14.742
- Kira? 
- Be discreet.

01:14:19.701 --> 01:14:24.616
If you want to go to Kira,

01:14:24.618 --> 01:14:27.481
follow me.

01:14:27.485 --> 01:14:32.860
Or you can leave. The decision is yours

01:14:39.386 --> 01:14:44.458
"Mandrake". In the Middle Ages 
people were convinced...

01:14:44.461 --> 01:14:47.245
she possessed magical powers.

01:14:47.495 --> 01:14:50.533
They believed that would be
collected under the scaffold,

01:14:50.545 --> 01:14:53.737
because burgeoned thanks to 
the sperm of the condemned.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:56.943
So nowadays it should be easy to find.

01:14:56.945 --> 01:14:58.745
Yes.

01:14:59.365 --> 01:15:04.868
In German it is called "Alraune" 
and comes from the term "raunen".

01:15:04.871 --> 01:15:08.871
Which means to mumble or whisper.

01:15:09.321 --> 01:15:13.685
Thanks to Mandrake, I can feel 
your desires...

01:15:13.688 --> 01:15:16.560
in your nerves, my friend.

01:15:16.564 --> 01:15:23.563
She brought you here. Kira was 
just your sweet desire.

01:15:23.764 --> 01:15:30.315
But tonight you'll get much 
more than a sweet desire.

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:12.860
You'll get used. Come on, again.

01:16:19.593 --> 01:16:27.377
Now you have to trust me. 
You can do it?

01:16:28.227 --> 01:16:31.203
I can not say that I like.

01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:35.328
You can still get up and go away.

01:16:41.604 --> 01:16:45.162
It's only the beginning,

01:16:45.165 --> 01:16:49.387
until you get used to this experience.

01:16:49.437 --> 01:16:52.612
Now comes the most important part.

01:16:52.615 --> 01:16:58.155
When it happens, 
you really want to peek,

01:16:58.375 --> 01:17:05.366
But don't you dare take off 
the blindfold.

01:17:06.022 --> 01:17:12.989
- Don't look. Got it? 
- Yes.

01:17:15.225 --> 01:17:20.348
What the hell was I doing? 
It was too late to leave.

01:18:30.712 --> 01:18:32.687
Eden...

01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:39.521
- Eden...
- Kira, Kira, Kira...

01:18:45.213 --> 01:18:48.860
- I can not handle it anymore.
- It's a vicious circle.

01:18:48.863 --> 01:18:52.015
Please Peter... One last time.

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:57.606
I hope you will not disappoint me.

01:19:03.956 --> 01:19:09.540
- So did you get fucked? 
- It was not how to do it with a woman.

01:19:10.732 --> 01:19:14.149
It's was like... a dream.

01:19:14.499 --> 01:19:18.016
Ah ok. Then no problem.

01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:24.633
I've never experienced such a thing.

01:19:25.383 --> 01:19:29.650
Every thought or wish 
that I could think of...

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:32.567
...had been satisfied by her.

01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:56.394
Good morning.

01:19:58.344 --> 01:20:01.611
The side effects will 
disappear soon.

01:20:02.436 --> 01:20:07.478
- I'm fine. 
- I know.

01:20:11.912 --> 01:20:14.345
Welcome, Eden.

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:19.379
When I got home I was exhausted.

01:20:20.304 --> 01:20:22.487
I was lonely.

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:38.147
- Ready? 
- Kira, I am your admirer.

01:20:38.455 --> 01:20:39.997
Eden?

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.233
Hello, dancer. I...

01:20:43.235 --> 01:20:45.289
I don't want you to call me here.

01:20:45.291 --> 01:20:48.806
You should write it on your 
business card.

01:20:49.155 --> 01:20:50.806
I...

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:56.440
I just wanted to say thank you for the
most beautiful experience of my life.

01:20:56.490 --> 01:20:58.115
It's was really special.

01:20:58.119 --> 01:21:02.099
Eden, stop calling. 
We can never go there again.

01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:07.424
Kira, come on. I really hope 
to see you next Saturday.

01:21:07.765 --> 01:21:10.433
Kira? When did you leave?

01:21:11.385 --> 01:21:15.842
Do you know what the word 
"Alraune" means?

01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:19.570
I think it means "whisper".

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:21.320
That is the second syllable.

01:21:21.323 --> 01:21:25.492
The first comes from "alb," 
and the German word "nightmare".

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:30.150
Listen, Eden. You must relax
your neck muscles...

01:21:30.155 --> 01:21:32.251
When you are blindfolded.

01:21:32.533 --> 01:21:35.051
It's all an illusion...

01:21:35.101 --> 01:21:40.393
When they relax, the blindfold 
over your eyes becomes loose.

01:21:40.544 --> 01:21:43.975
And you can glimpse through 
the bottom.

01:21:43.977 --> 01:21:45.420
And?

01:21:45.425 --> 01:21:47.702
You have to look.

01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:54.995
A strange body is born from 
the head of the dead ant...

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.653
Guess what I did on the 
following Saturday.

01:22:05.233 --> 01:22:08.329
But this time something was different.

01:22:09.054 --> 01:22:13.729
Yes. Once things quieted, 
they got twisted.

01:22:15.877 --> 01:22:18.788
Hello...

01:22:24.245 --> 01:22:25.872
Kira?

01:22:29.255 --> 01:22:31.055
Kira...

01:22:31.598 --> 01:22:35.373
Hello! How are you?

01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:40.598
Kira won't be returning. 
She finished with the group.

01:22:41.048 --> 01:22:44.515
I thought that the members 
could not leave?

01:22:44.565 --> 01:22:49.957
You came here to reflect 
or to have fun?

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:03.067
You must relax your neck muscles.

01:23:03.217 --> 01:23:05.900
It's 's all an illusion.

01:23:06.618 --> 01:23:09.418
Come on, sailor.

01:23:15.801 --> 01:23:19.075
It begins again. 
But this time is different.

01:23:19.078 --> 01:23:22.501
All my internal reflections
were on alert.

01:23:46.045 --> 01:23:48.570
You have to look.

01:24:27.415 --> 01:24:34.395
Eden... From now on, you 
have to follow the rules.

01:24:34.399 --> 01:24:37.570
I'm not kidding...

01:24:37.577 --> 01:24:40.820
You put yourself in danger.

01:24:40.824 --> 01:24:44.925
It was what my mother told me
when she caught me masturbating.

01:24:46.191 --> 01:24:49.567
You don't understand!

01:24:51.867 --> 01:24:54.067
Hell!

01:24:56.917 --> 01:24:59.184
I apologize.

01:25:09.193 --> 01:25:13.402
- The dreams don't do these things. 
- Of course, love.

01:25:13.465 --> 01:25:17.152
I knew then I was in real trouble.

01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:22.895
I had to speak with Kira, 
but she didn't answer the phone.

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:26.400
So, the next night...

01:26:02.989 --> 01:26:04.798
Kira?

01:26:10.115 --> 01:26:11.940
Hello?

01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:47.576
Kira?

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.321
Kira?

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.514
Kira?

01:27:53.148 --> 01:27:54.781
Kira.

01:28:07.332 --> 01:28:09.191
Kira?

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:18.466
- Eden? 
- Yes. Are you OK?

01:28:18.516 --> 01:28:20.233
Eden...

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:24.600
Excuse me, but the door was open.

01:28:26.633 --> 01:28:30.665
- Go away. 
- I... I just wanted to talk to you.

01:28:30.667 --> 01:28:34.294
- Go away. 
- Come on, Kira. Just a second.

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:38.356
- Get out! 
- Hey... Listen...

01:28:38.359 --> 01:28:40.551
Go!

01:28:42.585 --> 01:28:45.502
Go away!

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.538
Don't do it!

01:29:11.054 --> 01:29:15.112
My God. Kira, stop! Stop!

01:29:16.322 --> 01:29:18.338
Stop!

01:29:30.955 --> 01:29:34.239
- I'll help you. 
- Mom!

01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:39.956
Mom! My mom!

01:29:40.576 --> 01:29:43.348
- Shit! 
- Mom!

01:29:43.377 --> 01:29:45.848
Someone answer, dammit!

01:29:53.274 --> 01:29:57.782
- What happened? 
- Nothing.

01:30:17.159 --> 01:30:20.201
Do you want to save my soul?

01:30:58.415 --> 01:31:01.288
Peter, open up!

01:31:02.055 --> 01:31:05.300
Open the door!

01:31:10.412 --> 01:31:12.663
We need to talk.

01:31:20.414 --> 01:31:25.031
Kira died. She killed herself.

01:31:25.431 --> 01:31:26.631
No.

01:31:26.639 --> 01:31:33.106
I'm sorry. Perhaps she was 
too much of a child.

01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:39.182
A butterfly with wings of dust.

01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:43.533
Beautiful poetry...
Ugly situation.

01:31:43.541 --> 01:31:49.475
To be one of his servants, 
you need stronger wings.

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:55.316
Shut your mouth. Servant to whom?

01:31:55.967 --> 01:32:01.950
After tasting their passion, 
you belong to them.

01:32:02.625 --> 01:32:08.298
You are wrong. 
You're wrong, old man.

01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:12.043
I belong to no one!

01:32:16.343 --> 01:32:20.168
It might be hard to accept,

01:32:20.875 --> 01:32:24.469
but I don't regret a single thing.

01:32:24.519 --> 01:32:30.544
Eden... this time we 
reinvented ourselves,

01:32:30.594 --> 01:32:32.736
our world.

01:32:32.745 --> 01:32:39.198
But we remain slaves of our imperfections 
and relationships in which we are trapped.

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:46.199
And all our certainties pale 
in comparison to our imagination.

01:32:47.233 --> 01:32:51.338
Alraune, deliver us from this.

01:32:51.688 --> 01:32:58.071
She gives us a pleasure that 
no other lover can give.

01:32:58.938 --> 01:33:03.090
Listen to me, you do what you want.

01:33:03.097 --> 01:33:09.410
But I'm leaving.

01:33:09.414 --> 01:33:11.738
- You understand me? 
- Sure.

01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:17.723
And I will never return!

01:33:26.225 --> 01:33:32.482
They will not let you go, my friend...

01:33:39.825 --> 01:33:45.625
When I got home, Peter's words
rang in my head.

01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:25.553
I forgot the keys.

01:34:28.965 --> 01:34:33.029
- Oh god... 
- It's not my blood.

01:34:46.676 --> 01:34:52.439
This is my story. 
And you are my happy ending.

01:35:17.724 --> 01:35:18.815
Maya...

01:35:18.818 --> 01:35:22.241
Maya, look at me.

01:35:24.458 --> 01:35:26.541
Look at me.

01:35:33.083 --> 01:35:37.017
Who... who...

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:42.901
Eden... What?

01:35:46.044 --> 01:35:47.900
Eden?

01:37:23.642 --> 01:37:26.017
What are you doing?

01:37:29.868 --> 01:37:32.676
I can not sleep.

01:37:38.818 --> 01:37:40.385
Eden...

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:44.000
Do you really want to go there...?

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:45.399
Again?

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:49.877
No, no, no, no. Don't.

01:37:50.775 --> 01:37:53.069
Just one last time.

01:37:53.719 --> 01:37:56.528
Give it to me... Please, Maya...

01:37:57.445 --> 01:37:58.945
Maya...

01:37:59.715 --> 01:38:01.390
- Give it back.
- No.

01:38:01.395 --> 01:38:06.137
- I have some things to sort out, ok? 
- No, you don't go.

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:11.321
I feel like dying. I have to go. 
Give it to me!

01:38:14.346 --> 01:38:18.746
I don't know what you hope to 
find there,

01:38:33.425 --> 01:38:36.825
but I can give you more.

01:39:47.853 --> 01:39:51.287
Maya...

01:39:53.837 --> 01:39:56.912
Maya, what is it?
