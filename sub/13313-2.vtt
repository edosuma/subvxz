12:59.864 --> 13:01.781
Is that what you want?

13:01.781 --> 13:04.201
To ruin the only source
of income that you have?

13:04.201 --> 13:07.830
So long as you stay sober
and keep away from Hector,

13:07.830 --> 13:10.415
his company will provide you
with a stipend

13:10.415 --> 13:12.792
of $25,000 a month.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.963
Why don't you go suck each other
off in a corner somewhere?

13:18.089 --> 13:21.801
You're listening to these rich
putos  now? Is that it?

13:21.801 --> 13:24.429
Little man,

13:24.429 --> 13:27.599
it has always been
you and me.

13:27.599 --> 13:28.850
Hasn't it?

13:28.850 --> 13:32.855
When the truth would
come calling?

13:32.855 --> 13:35.357
You and me.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.902
Tell me what you want, Hector.
Please.

13:41.446 --> 13:42.948
Speak to me.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.452
Fucking say something.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.706
I want you to take the money,
Marisol.

13:54.919 --> 13:56.002
Go to rehab.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.136
So, now you want me gone?

14:07.681 --> 14:08.682
Yes.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.685
'Cause you sure didn't
want me gone

14:11.685 --> 14:12.978
when I had your dick
in my mouth.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.570
Fuck you.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.962
It's your call, sweetie.

14:37.962 --> 14:39.879
I'm good either way.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.882
You get the money

14:42.882 --> 14:45.135
or you get Ray Donovan.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.239
You're not jerking off on me
in here, are you?

15:08.117 --> 15:10.535
No. Just shaving.

15:10.535 --> 15:15.040
What, you can't do two things
at once?

15:15.040 --> 15:17.625
Shave and jerk off?

15:17.625 --> 15:20.837
Why--why would I do that?

15:20.837 --> 15:24.049
Is that a thing?

15:24.049 --> 15:27.218
Jesus, Theresa, come--
I got to open up the club.

15:27.218 --> 15:28.762
And I got to get fucked.

15:28.762 --> 15:32.140
Why are you acting like this?
Huh?

15:32.140 --> 15:34.142
Y-you're gonna be a mother.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.977
Mothers fuck, Brendan.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.813
How do you think
they become mothers?

15:38.813 --> 15:40.732
What is it with you?

15:40.732 --> 15:41.900
I don't know.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.610
That SNAP shit doesn't cure you?

15:43.610 --> 15:45.403
I don't think it works
like that.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.490
You've got to get over your shit
and make love to me, Brendan.

15:48.490 --> 15:49.949
I'm serious.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.618
It's not fair.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.423
So, your daddy fuck you,
or just your priest?

16:07.759 --> 16:11.179
My daddy fucked me.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.806
I know.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.808
You're one of Romero's boys.

16:14.808 --> 16:18.520
That's how you know Hector.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.313
Ohh.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.358
Se aprieta la mandibula.

16:23.358 --> 16:26.986
You're a righteous fucking
pendejo,  huh?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.571
You think you know me?

16:28.571 --> 16:29.989
I know you fuck little kids.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.493
[laughs]
You don't know dick.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.537
You think I don't see you?

16:35.537 --> 16:37.914
Anyone who manhandles a woman
the way you do--

16:37.914 --> 16:40.167
you probably fuck women
like they're dogs, don't you?

16:42.627 --> 16:45.839
Una maldita ventana.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.675
Butt fucked as a boy,
mind fucked as a man.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.344
[chuckles]

16:51.344 --> 16:53.138
You need to be quiet now,
all right?

16:53.138 --> 16:55.974
Maybe we could pull over and
have a little cry together, huh?

16:55.974 --> 16:58.685
And then you can fuck me
real hard,

16:58.685 --> 17:01.063

17:01.063 --> 17:02.730
Right, daddy?

- Mom says you really want me

17:09.571 --> 17:11.364
to come to this thing tonight.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.200
Yeah, I just thought it'd be
nice to have everyone together.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.035
- You know?
- It's a big deal to you?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.247
Oh, I just--I thought it was
something we could do.

17:18.247 --> 17:19.581
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to. It's fine.

17:19.581 --> 17:23.668
Look at you
with the parental mind games.

17:23.668 --> 17:26.255
I want to be honest with you,
though, Daddy.

17:26.255 --> 17:29.174
I'm not sure I really want
to be home.

17:29.174 --> 17:32.385
I-I'm gonna try, but my life
is different now, and--

17:32.385 --> 17:34.471
I get it. You don't want
to come, you don't have to.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.181
It's fine. Really.

17:36.181 --> 17:37.849
I love you.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.562
That your whore?

17:42.562 --> 17:43.980
What the fuck is your problem?

17:43.980 --> 17:45.190
Men don't talk to their wives
that way.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.441
She got to be your whore.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.073
Ooh, sorry.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.134
It's Mickey.
They found him.

18:13.134 --> 18:15.470
- What?
- The black cop, Muncie,

18:15.470 --> 18:17.222
she has him downtown.

18:17.222 --> 18:19.349
They're going to charge him
with the Minassian thing.

18:19.349 --> 18:20.850
He's going to talk, Ray.

18:20.850 --> 18:23.436
Fuck. All right.
I'll be in touch.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.024
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

What am I supposed to do
with her?

Sit on her.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.737
Food, water. No drugs.

18:41.037 --> 18:44.123
You ever bounce
on the boss's dick?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.251
Yeah, I bet you have.
I bet you fucked him.

18:49.295 --> 18:52.465
Do you really think I waste my
time on cock, you fucking idiot?

18:52.465 --> 18:54.343

All right, G, you got to
stop obsessing about this,

This is all the crap
Bunchy should be taking care of.

Ran past, took the purse.

20:35.276 --> 20:36.944
And then you gave chase?

20:36.944 --> 20:40.406
Yeah. I caught up with him
in the alley off Sixth.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.492
And then what happened?

20:42.492 --> 20:45.244
Well, we struggled
a little bit.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.706
- A little bit?
- Fuck you, Daryll.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.166
Excuse me.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.834
Who struggled more, Terry?
You or him?

this done here, please?

Anything else I should know?

21:01.135 --> 21:04.347
- No, not really.
- Yes.

21:04.347 --> 21:07.100
He's got my car keys
and my wallet,

21:07.100 --> 21:11.104

Hector Campos fight tonight.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.398
Um, I just want
to get my stuff back.

Most likely, that's not gonna
happen, but I'll ask around.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.318
I'll see what I can do.
