No one to come home to...

00:08.620 --> 00:11.320
No one  to share their day with.

Those people are so lucky.

Hello mom?

00:49.900 --> 00:51.200
Dad?

00:54.150 --> 00:55.760
Yes.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.330
Samantha?

01:02.360 --> 01:04.030
We saw your car.

01:04.050 --> 01:05.349
Hey,sammy.What are you doing here?

01:05.370 --> 01:06.900
No,what are u doing here?

01:06.910 --> 01:09.980
I-I thought today was the day you guys go look for junk at garage sales.

01:09.990 --> 01:12.750
Well,it is.We came home early.I got some horrible news.

01:12.770 --> 01:14.690
She made me pass up a great box of doorknobs.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.230

01:17.410 --> 01:18.650
What was your horrible news?

01:18.670 --> 01:21.940
You know that condo we have listed over on college avenue?

01:23.040 --> 01:24.430
Well,there was a bidding war.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.400
And we solit.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.500
You do know that it wasn't an actual war,right?

01:31.520 --> 01:32.890
That was our only listing.

01:32.910 --> 01:35.090
And it sold.

01:35.140 --> 01:36.730
Hey,why don't you and dad go celebrate?

01:36.770 --> 01:38.510
Samantha,you don't understand.

01:38.760 --> 01:41.500
To get listings,you have to have a listing.

01:41.530 --> 01:46.080
It's like it's easier to get a job when you're working or to meet a man when you're dating somebody else.

01:46.430 --> 01:49.420
Oh,listen to me.I'talking to someone who doesn't have a job or a man.

01:50.430 --> 01:55.190
Why don't we just put another ad in the paper,like that--That picture of us with the cell phones?

01:55.210 --> 01:57.930
Oh,it looked like an escort service.

01:57.990 --> 01:59.480
We got calls.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.720
I know.

02:02.260 --> 02:04.120

02:04.160 --> 02:06.150
Nobody's selling this house.

02:06.220 --> 02:08.100
I just washed all the window screens.

02:08.130 --> 02:09.830

05:23.190 --> 05:24.420
Hey,i am insulted.

05:24.440 --> 05:28.610

I mean,i can.

05:30.790 --> 05:33.360
I mean,i ow someone who happens to be italian.

No,no,sweetie,because you're a lawyer and you can help me get his address.

05:37.280 --> 05:38.580
So you can slash his tires.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.920
No!No more bad.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.740
I-I've already messed up someone's whole life.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.970
I mean,who does that?

05:44.100 --> 05:45.260
Uh,my neighbor just called,

05:45.270 --> 05:49.780

05:50.260 --> 05:52.640
My mother does that.That's who.

05:53.350 --> 05:55.400
Thanks for signing in.Here's my card.

05:58.970 --> 06:00.640
Mrs.Newly,what's going on?

06:00.680 --> 06:02.430
How did you get in my house?

06:02.450 --> 06:04.740
Isn't that the great thing about living in a all town?

06:04.750 --> 06:05.870
No one locks their doors.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.160
I do,yeah.

06:07.180 --> 06:08.350
You can't sell mhouse.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.090
Is that something needed to say specifically at some point?

06:11.100 --> 06:12.840
No,no,i'm not-- I'm not--I'm not selling your house.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.620
I'm just making contacts.

06:14.650 --> 06:19.310
I've already met four potential clients and a strange man who sniffed your banister,and then he left.

06:19.350 --> 06:22.550
You let in mr.Darcy?This is not okay.

06:23.270 --> 06:25.980
We love this house...And we'd like to make an offer.

06:34.560 --> 06:39.290
Um,apparently the--The house might not actually be available after all.

06:39.370 --> 06:41.480
Okay,we don't want a big negotiation.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.050
We'll give you $30,000 over the asking price.

06:44.090 --> 06:45.980
I think you'll be very happy here.

07:00.310 --> 07:01.090
That's him.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.670
Now i gotta figure out what i'm gonna say to him.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.490
I need some sort of plan.

07:09.740 --> 07:10.900
I shou have sex with him.

07:10.950 --> 07:12.130
How is that gonna help my plan?

07:12.150 --> 07:13.260
What plan?

07:13.330 --> 07:15.260
- What?
- Oh,jeez.Forget it.

07:15.470 --> 07:17.840
Hey,wes greene!Wes greene.Hi.

07:20.080 --> 07:23.430
I'm samantha newly.I'm a friend of-- Of,uh,todd deepl's.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.240
How is todd?

07:26.280 --> 07:27.280
He's good.He's good.

07:27.300 --> 07:30.190
Look,you know that pulitzer prize you won?

07:30.230 --> 07:31.250
I do,yes.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.940
That should have been his.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.380
Okay um...

07:35.570 --> 07:37.500
Well,i'll just go get it then.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.000
No,no,no,no,no.

07:39.040 --> 07:42.050
You can--You can keep the--The thingamajigger just...

07:42.580 --> 07:44.690
Lookplease don't go on that interview today.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.300
Let todd get this job.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.550
And why would i do that?

07:47.590 --> 07:52.270
Look,todd was supposed to have that coal mine assignment,but i didn't give him the message,

07:52.300 --> 07:56.710
so in a way,you might say i kia got you that pulitzer prize.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.100
So basically,you owe me.

08:00.150 --> 08:04.000
Why--First of all,thank you for the pulitzer prize.

08:04.140 --> 08:04.750
It's okay.

08:04.760 --> 08:10.070
Although i don't recall you being in that mine shaft choking on dust and death for two days a mile underground

08:10.090 --> 08:12.850
or placing the camera or getting enough lights down there to shoot,

08:12.860 --> 08:17.130
but not too much light,so that people could feel the darkness those men live in down there.

08:17.210 --> 08:19.080
Yeah,okay,we get it.You got a camera.

08:19.340 --> 08:21.130
So does everybody else.I have one on my phone.

08:21.160 --> 08:25.990
Right,so if you don't mind,i'll just keep the prize and my interview appointment,which is in 20 mines.

08:26.030 --> 08:29.270
So i gotta get ready.Say hi to todd,okay?

08:53.690 --> 08:54.930
Oh use this.

08:55.890 --> 08:57.310
You carry that in your car?

08:57.450 --> 08:58.570
You don't?

08:59.430 --> 09:01.340
No,i can't do this.I can't do this.

09:01.350 --> 09:02.160
You've done it plenty.

09:02.170 --> 09:04.800
You just go through the side,where the steel belting's not in the way.

09:04.950 --> 09:05.800
No.No.

09:05.830 --> 09:09.220
I was mad a minute ago,but it is just--It's not right.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.910
So let's--Let's just go.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.790
No,you should go home,where because of you,

09:13.800 --> 09:18.670
todd is probably sitting there jobless,just teaching himself the banjo.

09:24.210 --> 09:27.460
See?It's just like riding a bike.Right?

09:33.690 --> 09:34.330
I can't believe it.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.870
I got the job the greawes greene was up for.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.250

But today i had to take the bus because someone slashed my te to get her boyfriend a job!

10:25.520 --> 10:26.900

10:26.940 --> 10:29.080

10:49.680 --> 10:51.830

10:51.870 --> 10:52.820
Did he?

10:53.010 --> 10:55.040
Did he need it because his wife divorced him

10:55.060 --> 10:59.600
and he has to show a judge that he's locally employed or he'll lose custody of his kids?

10:59.880 --> 11:01.020

11:02.320 --> 11:04.120
Fine.Fine.I have ruined yourife,too.

No, you go anywhere near my family,and i will run you down in t street!

11:13.430 --> 11:16.200
Need a pretty cooperative bus driver for that.

11:17.070 --> 11:18.370
Not funny.

11:19.010 --> 11:23.280
Great.Now to help wes,i just have to ruin todd's career again.

11:23.500 --> 11:27.600
By the wayi'm happy,and i never want your help.

11:29.320 --> 11:33.500
Dena,dena,this is a very good offer.

11:33.550 --> 11:34.740
I know.

11:35.010 --> 11:38.500

11:38.510 --> 11:40.930
I know.That's a l of money.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.590
In this market?

11:42.610 --> 11:46.810
With people all over ts country unable to sell their homes,it's like spitting in their faces.

11:46.980 --> 11:48.340
You know,this w my mom's house.

11:48.350 --> 11:51.050
I've never lived anywhere else.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.010

11:55.980 --> 11:58.090
Do you kw where your mother is right now?

11:58.510 --> 11:59.920
- In a wall.
- She's in here.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.330
- In a mausoleum over--
- I didn't mean literally.

12:02.350 --> 12:04.170
Okay,no,the point is...

12:04.300 --> 12:07.470
She's not here in this house.

12:07.740 --> 12:08.990
She's in heaven.

12:10.270 --> 12:15.130
And your boyiend's in the city,and samantha's in the city,and.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.910
That's where our future is,dena.

12:36.520 --> 12:37.610
Great.Amazing.

12:37.650 --> 12:39.860
Sam,this job is everything i've always wanted.

12:39.870 --> 12:40.880
Really?

12:41.450 --> 12:44.920
Even better than working...At a camera store?

12:44.990 --> 12:46.660
A camera store?No,no,this job is great.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.360
My assigent editor walked me through the storie i'm gonna be shooting--

12:49.470 --> 12:54.690

12:55.450 --> 12:57.480
Maybe london 2012?

12:57.490 --> 13:00.000
I mean,what,if you-- If you play your cards right?

13:00.010 --> 13:03.650
Ause i'm sure if you-- You want to walk on eggslls for the next four years.

13:03.660 --> 13:05.100
No wonder you're so stressed out.

13:05.110 --> 13:06.000
I'm not stressed out.

13:06.010 --> 13:07.950
Calm down,man!

13:08.050 --> 13:09.770
Breathe.Chill.

13:10.030 --> 13:13.360

You can do so much bette i-I believe in you.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.070
Wait.What's going on you were so happy i got this job.

13:21.090 --> 13:23.100
Okayall right,i'll say it.

13:23.140 --> 13:28.360
Look,i-I've seen your work,and,uh,it's not that good.

13:31.550 --> 13:32.500
Incredible.

13:32.530 --> 13:33.530
What?

13:33.560 --> 13:35.330
You just have to keep me down,don't you?

13:35.360 --> 13:37.130
No.No,no that's not it.

13:37.140 --> 13:39.440
well,then what?W-Why do you wt me to quit?

13:39.470 --> 13:40.570
Because...

13:41.620 --> 13:43.340
Because i.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.510
I just,uh,really started to miss u,you know?

13:47.530 --> 13:50.970
I just--It's really quiet around here.

13:51.010 --> 13:51.620
Yeah,exactly.

13:51.630 --> 13:53.900
When i was laying around the apartment claro,cuando estaba en like a lump,you could handle that.

13:53.910 --> 13:57.100
You know,i bet this is why i never got ywhere when we we together.

13:57.110 --> 13:58.490
Well,i'm going somewhere now.

13:58.870 --> 14:01.780
I'm going out to dinner wi my editor and publisher.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.330
Deal with it.

14:12.390 --> 14:13.500
Sam?

14:17.130 --> 14:21.320
You know,that martha stewart is a wackadoo,

14:21.340 --> 14:25.210
because this does not sharpen knives.

14:25.540 --> 14:27.240
Nope.It doesn't.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.640
You slashed wes greene's tire?

14:32.680 --> 14:34.210
Well,i tried reasoning with him first,

14:34.220 --> 14:38.210
and i-I wouldn't even have been able to slash the tire if andrea didn't carry a knife.

14:38.290 --> 14:41.280
You know what?Hearing it now,i bear very little responsibility here.

14:41.310 --> 14:43.210
So now i have to quit the job.

14:43.230 --> 14:44.660
Oh,god.Thank you so much for understanding.

14:44.670 --> 14:46.220
I mean, his life is in shambles.

14:46.230 --> 14:49.270
You know,he's getting divorced,his tire was slashed.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.390
I mean because i don't deserve it.

14:51.430 --> 14:54.270
Yes,you do deserve it,and you will get the next one.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.500
No,he can have it.I'm done.

14:55.570 --> 14:56.790
Done?With photography?

14:56.800 --> 14:58.210
No.Why?

14:58.220 --> 15:01.850
Because on the off chance you're not always ere to slash someone's tire for me,

15:01.860 --> 15:03.580
it's obvious i'll never have wes' career.

15:03.590 --> 15:06.010
Yeah,well,you know what?You would have if it wasn't for me.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.520
What?

15:08.760 --> 15:10.810
Thanks for doing my inspection, mr.Newly.

15:10.830 --> 15:12.170
Oh,not a problem.

15:12.210 --> 15:14.420
You know,those licensed gs are a racket.

15:14.450 --> 15:16.050
Carnies with a clipboard.

15:16.270 --> 15:19.550
No,everything is fine under there,but you got a little bluish stain in the sink there.

15:20.020 --> 15:23.600
You know what?That's just where my mom made a blueberry pie every sine sunday.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.500
Well,the new owners can just bleach it out,right?

15:25.510 --> 15:27.390
What?No!

15:27.670 --> 15:30.700
Every time i go to rinse out a glass,it makes me think of her.

15:30.730 --> 15:34.490
You know what?I'm just gonna take that--That sink with me.

15:34.650 --> 15:37.140
Well,they might notice that eventually.

15:37.620 --> 15:38.940
Oh,and here,this doorjamb--

15:38.950 --> 15:42.630
It has all the marks from where my mom measured my height every single birthday,

15:42.640 --> 15:47.380
and,oh,this asterisk by my 13th is 'cause i wouldn't take off my darth vader helmet.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.110
No,i'm--I'm--I'm ripping that out,too.

15:53.660 --> 15:54.760
And the front door?

15:54.800 --> 15:55.750
Taking it.

15:55.920 --> 16:00.900
Yeah,that's where chase and i had our first kiss,and,oh,i'm gonna need the floor in front of the fireplace

16:00.910 --> 16:03.090
because that's the first place,you,we...

16:03.130 --> 16:05.570
Never mind.But i'm--I'm gonna need that.

16:07.060 --> 16:08.960
Dena,are you sure you want to sell?

16:09.090 --> 16:11.150
Oh,yeah,sure.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.730
I mean--I mean,i signed a contract,right?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.640
Everybody's counting on me.

16:15.790 --> 16:17.070
So i guess...

16:17.860 --> 16:20.160
I just got off the phone with the new buyers.

16:20.470 --> 16:22.750
They wanted to make sure that you were leaving...

16:23.250 --> 16:25.950
That you were leaving the snoopy mailbox.

16:26.390 --> 16:28.750
Like--Like you were gonna take that with you.

16:29.470 --> 16:30.660
I want that.

16:31.540 --> 16:33.270
Regina,bad news.

16:33.300 --> 16:34.570
The sale ain't gonna happen.

16:34.850 --> 16:35.680
- What?
- What?

16:35.760 --> 16:37.360
Yeah,i was just down in the basement.

16:37.460 --> 16:39.700
I-It's riddled with mold.

16:40.590 --> 16:42.940
Mold?So?You n hang up an air freshener.

16:43.020 --> 16:45.230
Well,nobody's gonna buy a house with mold,regina,

16:45.240 --> 16:48.190
and now that you know,you have to disclose it.

16:48.810 --> 16:51.290
Well,thanks so much for your help,mr.Science.

16:51.420 --> 16:54.000
You're not a professional,and you cannot say anything against your wife in court.

16:54.010 --> 16:54.790
That's the law.

16:54.800 --> 16:58.210
Dena,dena,i'm gonna get a bottle of wine and some painkillers,

16:58.220 --> 17:01.280
and by tomorrow,you're gonna forget that this conversation ever happened.

17:01.550 --> 17:03.160
W-W-Wait.Wait.

17:03.210 --> 17:06.040
Don't blame mr.Newly.It's me.

17:06.810 --> 17:10.089
I'm happy here.I have a good life,you know?

17:10.220 --> 17:15.750
I have a boyfriend and a--And a best friend and--And a free house with a yard for my dogs.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.730
People work their whole lives to have what i already have.

17:18.740 --> 17:20.790
I mean,i don't want to leave!

17:26.930 --> 17:28.580
Okay.We got mold.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.320
I don't even have a basement.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.100
Well,i'm not a professional.

17:41.870 --> 17:43.000
Thanks,mr.Newly.

17:43.030 --> 17:44.200
Don't mention it.

17:44.330 --> 17:48.120
Oh,and,uh,your bedroom wiring is shot.

17:49.490 --> 17:50.310
Gotcha.

17:50.340 --> 17:51.700
No,i mean it.

17:51.780 --> 17:54.190
Fix it,or one night you'll wake up on fire.

17:57.850 --> 17:58.780
A vacation?

17:58.800 --> 18:01.210
You screwed me out of a job for a vacation?

18:01.220 --> 18:03.220
Okay,okay,okay.That's o scenario.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.960
Now just flip it around.

18:04.980 --> 18:06.250
I did you a favor.

18:06.270 --> 18:08.380
Oh,really?How's that?

18:08.410 --> 18:11.290
Say i did give you that message,and you had gotten that job.

18:11.320 --> 18:15.350
I mean,maybe you would have gotten a pulitzer prize and ended up just like wes--

18:15.380 --> 18:17.900
Failed marriage,not allowed to see our kids.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.900
Maybe i wouldn't have neglected our kids.

18:19.910 --> 18:20.960
Yes,you would've.

18:20.980 --> 18:22.250
You'd be gone all the time.

18:22.260 --> 18:23.640
What,and you're such a great mom?

18:23.650 --> 18:25.580
Yeah,well,at least i went to their soccer games!

18:25.600 --> 18:28.340
- Wait,sam.
- And the homework-- It's so hard!

18:28.360 --> 18:29.640
What are we talking about?

18:29.650 --> 18:31.240
I don't know!

18:32.060 --> 18:34.320
I'm just so ashamed.I'm...

18:34.860 --> 18:39.120
I am so,so sorry that i ruined your life.

18:41.900 --> 18:44.870
Well,i don't know if you ruined my life.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.430
Yeah,it was kind of ruined...

18:46.460 --> 18:47.170
By me.

18:47.180 --> 18:48.230
It's not ruined.

18:48.250 --> 18:49.180
Kinda is.

18:49.210 --> 18:50.270
Well,it's not even that bad.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.720
You didn't see wes' car.

18:51.780 --> 18:53.170
If it wasn't for me,you'd be driving that car.

18:53.180 --> 18:54.100
Okay,stop.

18:54.110 --> 18:55.270
Can you drive a stick,though?

18:55.290 --> 18:56.530
Sam,come on.

18:56.830 --> 18:59.260
You know,i-I know that you think you pull all the strings,but you're not god.

18:59.270 --> 19:01.170
You don't control the universe.

19:01.230 --> 19:03.380
That's very sweet,todd,but just not true.

19:03.400 --> 19:07.040
Believe me.I would love to blame you for everything bad that's ever happened,

19:07.050 --> 19:09.800
and--And not giving me that message--Yeah,that was bad.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.340
Yeah,but since then,i might've...

19:13.050 --> 19:15.080
Made a few wrong moves on my own.

19:15.300 --> 19:18.450
No,you said i always kept you down.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.830
Well...

19:20.690 --> 19:21.970
I was mad.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.000
The truth is,i've never been a big self-Start.

19:26.610 --> 19:29.370
When we were together,you kind of kicked my ass into gear.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.240
Really?

19:32.930 --> 19:35.570
Which is maybe why since we've been apart,i've...

19:37.880 --> 19:39.500
Kind of sputtereoh.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.500
Quit.

19:50.630 --> 19:52.030
Recommend wes.

19:52.510 --> 19:54.210
We'll find you something better.

19:55.450 --> 19:56.550
Camera store?

19:57.330 --> 19:58.930
Even better.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.780
Okay,so like i was saying,

20:04.820 --> 20:09.730
except the opposite,it is a nice thing to have people in your life.

20:14.020 --> 20:17.720
You just have to remember that they're in charge  of their own destiny..

20:18.050 --> 20:18.900
Give me that.

20:18.960 --> 20:22.800
And that  you can't control them,no matter how much you want to.

20:22.830 --> 20:23.750
Yeah,here we go.

20:27.940 --> 20:33.370
No matter how much they really  need you to take the wheel,don't do it.

20:40.030 --> 20:44.850
All you can do is give them  a nudge in the right direction and hope for the best.

20:47.420 --> 20:50.400
The good news is,you'll have more time to focus on your own life,

20:50.420 --> 20:53.730
to solve your own problems,big and small...

20:55.850 --> 20:59.730
Like how to do a crossword  puzzle when you have amnesia.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.460
I blank ly.

21:04.260 --> 21:05.200
Who the hell is lucy?
