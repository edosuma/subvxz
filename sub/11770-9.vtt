HEY, LARRY.

00:21.733 --> 00:22.267
HEY.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.233
HOW ARE YOU ?

00:23.267 --> 00:24.167
OKAY.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.033
GOOD.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.333
HEY, LISTEN,
IS THIS TRUE ?

00:27.367 --> 00:29.667
DID I HEAR THAT YOU WERE AT
THE U2 CONCERT LAST NIGHT ?

00:29.700 --> 00:31.733
( laughing )

00:31.767 --> 00:32.867
I GOT TO TELL YOU, MAN,
I BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT

00:32.900 --> 00:34.700
AND I CAN'T
SEE YOU THERE.

00:34.733 --> 00:36.633
OH, YEAH, MY WIFE
DRAGGED ME THERE.

00:36.667 --> 00:37.733
SHE HAD THESE
TICKETS, AND...

00:37.767 --> 00:39.067
UH-HUH.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.867
SO, I DID IT AS
A FAVOR TO MY WIFE.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.200
IT'S A LITTLE
EMBARRASSING TO ME.

00:42.233 --> 00:43.433
DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.

00:43.467 --> 00:44.867
HEY, YOU LIKE

00:44.900 --> 00:46.500
HOW'D YOU KNOW
I WAS AT THE U2 CONCERT ?

00:46.533 --> 00:49.033
UH, WELL, YOU KNOW MARGE,
AT THE FRONT.

00:49.067 --> 00:50.367
SHE CALLED TO CONFIRM
YOUR APPOINTMENT,

00:50.400 --> 00:53.467
APPARENTLY YOUR HOUSEKEEPER TOLD
HER THAT YOU HAD BEEN THERE.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.900
MY HOUSEKEEPER TOLD MARGE
I WAS AT THE U2 CONCERT ?

00:56.933 --> 00:59.700
UH, THAT'S WHAT,
YEAH, APPARENTLY, YEAH.

00:59.733 --> 01:01.633
YEAH.

01:01.667 --> 01:03.700
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE INTO
THE ROCK AND ROLL THING.

01:03.733 --> 01:06.067
WELL, I'M NOT, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I JUST DON'T LIKE THE IDEA

01:06.067 --> 01:08.733
THAT EVERYTHING I DO,
PEOPLE ARE FINDING OUT ABOUT

01:08.767 --> 01:10.233
THROUGH MY HOUSEKEEPER,
THAT'S ALL.

01:10.267 --> 01:12.300
HEY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE YOU DID YESTERDAY.

01:12.333 --> 01:15.167
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
I KNOW ABOUT YESTERDAY.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.867
WELL, DON'T MENTION TO ANYBODY
THAT I WAS AT THE U2 CONCERT,

01:17.900 --> 01:18.433
IF YOU CAN.

01:18.467 --> 01:19.200
ALRIGHT.

01:19.233 --> 01:21.333
SO, LET'S
MOVE PAST THAT,

01:21.367 --> 01:22.733
AND WHAT DO WE GOT
GOING ON HERE TODAY ?

01:22.767 --> 01:27.133
UM, I HAVE SOMETHING
STUCK IN MY THROAT.

01:27.167 --> 01:27.800
LET ME SEE.

01:27.833 --> 01:29.733
I GOT A, UH...

01:30.400 --> 01:33.067

01:34.267 --> 01:36.967
YOU GOT A PUBIC HAIR
IN YOUR THROAT ?

01:37.067 --> 01:37.533
YEAH.

01:37.567 --> 01:38.867
ALRIGHT, HEY.

01:38.900 --> 01:42.667
UH, WELL, LET'S TAKE
A LOOK AT IT THEN.

01:44.067 --> 01:45.467
THAT'S NOT
THAT UNUSUAL.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.700
I GOT PEOPLE IN HERE
ALL THE TIME WITH STUFF
STUCK IN THEIR THROAT.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.100
GENERALLY,
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

01:49.133 --> 01:52.300
IT'S NOT EVEN SOMETHING
I DO THAT OFTEN, AND, UH...

01:52.333 --> 01:54.133
YOU KNOW WHAT, DON'T EVEN
NEED TO KNOW THE SCHEDULE.

01:54.167 --> 01:55.333
I KNOW, I'M JUST,
UH, YOU KNOW...

01:55.367 --> 01:58.067

01:58.067 --> 02:00.067
THERE IT IS,
YEAH, I SEE IT.

02:00.067 --> 02:01.067
I SEE IT BACK THERE.

02:01.067 --> 02:03.067
IT'S PRETTY FAR BACK,
AND IT'S KIND OF,

02:03.067 --> 02:04.700
IT'S KIND OF WRAPPED
ITSELF AROUND.

02:04.733 --> 02:07.900
SO, UH, I CAN GO GET IT
FOR YOU IF YOU WANT ME TO.

02:07.933 --> 02:10.133
BUT IT WILL, UH,
I'LL TELL YOU NOW,

02:10.167 --> 02:11.300
IT'S GONNA BE
A LITTLE PAINFUL FOR YOU.

02:11.333 --> 02:13.300
IT'S GONNA HURT,
FRANKLY, IT'S GONNA HURT.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.267
THERE IS
THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.867
WHICH IS,
KIND OF FLUSH IT OUT.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.500
YOU TAKE SOME LIQUIDS
AND IT WILL FLUSH OUT.

02:18.533 --> 02:19.867
THREE DAYS
AT THE MOST.

02:19.900 --> 02:23.500
JESUS, IT'S JUST KIND OF STUCK
IN THERE AND IT'S SCRATCHING ME.

02:23.533 --> 02:26.767
YOU KNOW, I JUST FEEL LIKE
I CAN GET IT UP BUT I CAN'T.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.100
I KNOW, YOUR CHOICE.

02:28.133 --> 02:29.633
HAPPY TO GO IN AND GET IT
FOR YOU IF YOU'D LIKE.

02:29.667 --> 02:33.733
OR YOU CAN JUST LET IT, UH,
COME ON OUT BY ITSELF.

02:33.767 --> 02:35.533
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

02:35.567 --> 02:37.133
FINE, I'LL JUST WAIT.

02:37.167 --> 02:38.500
OKAY, LITTLE ADVICE.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.967
YEAH ?

02:40.067 --> 02:42.067
WHATEVER HAPPENED, STAY AWAY
FROM THAT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

02:42.100 --> 02:43.200
DON'T WORRY.

02:43.233 --> 02:44.867
I'LL BE STAYING AWAY
FROM IT FOR A WHILE.

02:44.900 --> 02:45.900
VERY GOOD.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.633

OKAY, ALRIGHT.

02:53.300 --> 02:53.833
OKAY, THANK YOU.

02:56.233 --> 02:58.200
HOW DID YOUR DOCTOR'S
APPOINTMENT GO ?

02:58.233 --> 03:01.300
UH, I GOT ABOUT ANOTHER
TWO DAYS WITH THIS THING.

03:01.333 --> 03:04.167
HE LOOKED AT IT AND JUST SAYS
IT WILL GO AWAY BY ITSELF.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.433
LISTEN, LARRY,

03:05.467 --> 03:08.067
WE HAVE A LOT TO DO
BEFORE MY PARENTS GET HERE.

03:08.067 --> 03:08.700
WHAT ?

03:08.733 --> 03:10.067
WHAT'S THERE TO DO ?

03:10.067 --> 03:11.667
WELL, WE NEED TO DO
ALL THEIR CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.767

A CHRISTMAS TREE.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.067
WE'VE GOT TO GET--

03:15.067 --> 03:16.333
HOLD IT,
HOLD IT, HOLD IT.

03:16.367 --> 03:18.267

PICK OUT A CHRISTMAS TREE

03:23.167 --> 03:24.667

03:24.700 --> 03:26.500
WE'RE GETTING
A CHRISTMAS TREE ?

03:26.533 --> 03:28.067
MY PARENTS ARE COMING.

03:28.067 --> 03:29.367
WE'RE CELEBRATING
CHRISTMAS.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.067
IS THAT
A SURPRISE TO YOU ?

03:31.067 --> 03:32.433
GIVE ME A BREAK
ON THE TREE.

03:32.467 --> 03:33.467
DO WE HAVE
TO DO THAT ?

03:33.500 --> 03:34.967
OF COURSE WE DO.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.200
IT'S CHRISTMAS.

03:36.233 --> 03:37.967
IT'S TOO WEIRD, MAN.

03:38.067 --> 03:39.733
COME ON, THAT IS
JUST TOO WEIRD.

03:39.767 --> 03:41.067
NO, LISTEN, MAN,
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT.

03:41.100 --> 03:42.600
I'M A JEW, TO HAVE THE TREE
IN THE HOUSE, IT'S BAD LUCK.

03:42.633 --> 03:43.833
YOU KNOW,
MY GUY MIGHT NOT,

03:43.867 --> 03:45.833
MAY THINK I'M SWITCHING
OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW,

03:45.867 --> 03:47.067
HE MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND.

03:47.067 --> 03:48.367
I THINK YOUR GUY IS
GONNA BE FINE WITH IT.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.667
DON'T YOU WANT MY--

03:49.700 --> 03:53.500

03:54.400 --> 03:56.567
I'M SORRY.

03:56.600 --> 04:00.667
DID YOU TIP ANYBODY YET
FOR CHRISTMAS ?

04:00.700 --> 04:02.567
HUH ?
NO, NO.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.667
YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE CARE OF THAT ?

04:03.700 --> 04:05.400
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT.

04:05.433 --> 04:07.267
AND THEN I GOT TO GO GET JEFF,
WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE CLUB

04:07.300 --> 04:08.900

04:08.933 --> 04:10.567
THERE'S NO END TO IT
WITH THIS HOLIDAY.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.900
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S GONNA MAKE FEEL GOOD.

04:13.933 --> 04:16.833

04:16.867 --> 04:19.467
WHAT SHOULD I GIVE HER
AH, YOU DON'T KNOW, AH...

04:23.900 --> 04:25.067
HEY, DORA.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.333

A FAVOR, OKAY ?

04:30.367 --> 04:33.600
WHEN PEOPLE CALL
AND ASK FOR ME,

04:33.633 --> 04:36.867
COULD YOU PLEASE JUST
NOT TELL THEM WHERE I AM ?

04:36.900 --> 04:39.067
OKAY.

04:39.067 --> 04:41.133

04:49.167 --> 04:50.667
OKAY, OKAY.

04:50.700 --> 04:51.567

THE "TU" FORM WITH ME.

06:01.633 --> 06:02.600
"TU" ?

06:02.633 --> 06:04.467
"USTED'S" A LITTLE
FORMAL FOR US.

WHY DON'T WE USE
THE "TU" FORM ?

06:06.133 --> 06:07.333

06:29.933 --> 06:31.800
U2 CONCERT ?

06:31.833 --> 06:36.433
MY WIFE DRAGGED ME TO
THE CONCERT, SO, BIG DEAL.

06:36.467 --> 06:38.200
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE
IN THE BAND ?

06:38.233 --> 06:40.267
NO, WELL, YEAH,
I KNOW THE LEAD SINGER.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.067
WHAT'S HIS NAME ?

06:41.067 --> 06:42.100
I KNOW HIS NAME.

06:42.133 --> 06:43.167
YOU DON'T KNOW
HIS NAME.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.067
YEAH, HEY, ASSHOLE,
I KNOW HIS NAME.

06:44.100 --> 06:44.667
YOU DON'T KNOW HIS NAME.

06:44.700 --> 06:45.500
DO YOU WANT TO BET ?

06:45.533 --> 06:46.467
100 BUCKS.

06:46.500 --> 06:49.167
OKAY, HIS NAME'S,
UH, B-O-N-O.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.067
YOU GOT TO
PRONOUNCE IT.

06:50.067 --> 06:53.100
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO PRONOUNCE IT.

06:53.133 --> 06:55.233
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
SONNY BONO, OR BONO.

06:55.267 --> 06:55.800
IT'S BONO.

06:55.833 --> 06:56.700
IT'S BONO.

06:56.733 --> 06:57.700
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

06:57.733 --> 06:59.333
BECAUSE YOU SPELLED IT,
IT'S A DRAW.

06:59.367 --> 07:00.733
OKAY, I DON'T
OWE YOU ANYTHING.

07:00.767 --> 07:01.733
EVEN, OKAY.

07:01.767 --> 07:02.933
WHO TOLD YOU
BY THE WAY ?

07:02.967 --> 07:04.200
DORA.

07:05.167 --> 07:06.733
I CALLED THE HOUSE
AND SHE TOLD ME.

07:06.767 --> 07:07.700
THAT IS JUST
UNBELIEVABLE.

07:07.733 --> 07:09.633
I JUST SPOKE
TO HER ABOUT THAT.

07:09.667 --> 07:12.400
MY DOCTOR KNOWS NOW,
NOW YOU KNOW.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.067
SHE TOLD THE DOCTOR
THE SAME THING.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.867
OKAY, WELL, YOU NEED
TO TALK WITH YOUR MAID.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.767
WELL, IF YOU COME OVER MY HOUSE
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS,

07:20.800 --> 07:21.967
YOU'LL SEE A
CHRISTMAS TREE THERE.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.067
WHY ?

07:24.067 --> 07:26.167
CHERYL'S PARENTS ARE COMING,
SHE WANTS A TREE.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.200
IT'S NOT GONNA
END THERE.

07:27.233 --> 07:28.267
I'VE NEVER HAD
A CHRISTMAS TREE IN MY LIFE.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.133
IT'S A LITTLE UNSETTLING,
YOU KNOW.

07:30.167 --> 07:31.200
IT'S UNSETTLING.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.167
NOTHING WORSE
THAN JEWS WITH TREES.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.267
AT LEAST YOUR
WIFE'S NOT JEWISH.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.300
WELL, MY WIFE'S
NOT JEWISH, YEAH.

07:35.333 --> 07:36.333
BUT THOSE COUPLES ?

07:36.367 --> 07:37.733
TWO JEWS GETTING TREES.

07:37.767 --> 07:39.067
( ringing )
THEY CAN'T LET THEM
HAVE THEIR HOLIDAY.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.700
WE HAVE TO HONE IN
ON THEIR HOLIDAY.

07:40.733 --> 07:42.367
IT MAKES ME CRAZY.

07:42.400 --> 07:43.433
YEAH.

07:43.467 --> 07:45.333
THEY CAN'T JUST LET THEM
HAVE THEIR HOLIDAY.

07:45.367 --> 07:46.733
LISTEN TO ME,
LISTEN TO ME.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.467
SUSIE'S ON HER WAY UP,
RIGHT NOW.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.667
OKAY, A COUPLE WEEKS AGO,
SHE WENT OUT OF TOWN,

07:50.700 --> 07:53.267
I MADE A PHONE CALL,
LIKE, ABOUT TWO IN THE MORNING,

07:53.300 --> 07:55.133
TO A FRIEND,
WOMAN, PLUTONIC.

07:55.167 --> 07:56.633
OKAY, NOTHING GOING ON.

07:56.667 --> 07:58.433
BUT SHE FOUND
THE PHONE BILL.

07:58.467 --> 08:00.433
AND I TOLD HER
IT WAS YOU, OKAY.

08:00.467 --> 08:02.200
I SAID YOU GOT IN
A FIGHT WITH CHERYL,

08:02.233 --> 08:05.233
YOU SLEPT OVER, AND THEN YOU
MADE THE PHONE CALL, OKAY ?

08:05.267 --> 08:06.867
WOW, WHAT A WILD STORY.

08:06.900 --> 08:08.067
I DON'T THINK
IT'S THAT BAD.

08:08.067 --> 08:08.833
IT'S GOOD.

08:08.867 --> 08:09.700
IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

08:09.733 --> 08:10.867
I DO THINK IT'S GOOD.

08:10.900 --> 08:11.933
WELL, THANK YOU.

08:11.967 --> 08:13.867
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
TELL HER THE TRUTH ?

08:13.900 --> 08:16.800
HEY, 10 P.M. IS THE CUT-OFF
FOR PLUTONIC FRIENDS.

08:16.833 --> 08:18.400
AFTER 10 P.M.
IT GETS WEIRD.

08:19.267 --> 08:20.633
HI HONEY.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.267
OH, LARRY, I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU WERE HERE.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.133
HOW ARE YOU,
SWEETHEART ?

08:24.167 --> 08:25.133
HI.

08:25.167 --> 08:26.067
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.233
IT'S SO GREAT
WHEN YOU COME.

08:27.267 --> 08:28.533
AWW, HERE'S THE KEYS.

08:28.567 --> 08:29.400
THANK YOU.

08:29.433 --> 08:30.500
SO...

08:30.533 --> 08:32.133
( clearing throat )

08:32.167 --> 08:34.300
WHAT THE FUCK
IS YOUR PROBLEM ?

08:34.333 --> 08:35.267
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HIM ?

08:35.300 --> 08:36.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

08:36.500 --> 08:38.767
NO, NO, I GOT SOMETHING
STUCK IN MY THROAT.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.700
JUST HAVE SOME WATER.

08:40.733 --> 08:42.467
HEY, BY THE WAY,
DO I OWE YOU ANY MONEY FOR,

08:42.500 --> 08:45.300
UM, SOME OF THOSE PHONE CALLS
THAT I MADE LAST--

08:45.333 --> 08:46.600
UH, OH, NO, NO, NO.

08:46.633 --> 08:48.967
YOU WERE IN A BAD PLACE,
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

08:49.067 --> 08:50.433
I KNOW I KIND OF RAN UP
A BILL ON YOU THERE.

08:50.467 --> 08:51.767
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.667
WHO ARE YOU CALLING AT
TWO A.M. FROM MY HOUSE, LARRY,

08:53.700 --> 08:54.800
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT ?

08:54.833 --> 08:57.933
I WAS CALLING MY,
UH, HOUSEKEEPER DORA.

08:57.967 --> 08:58.933
WAIT A MINUTE.

08:58.967 --> 09:00.767
YOU HAVE A FIGHT
WITH CHERYL.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.700
YOU SLEEP AT MY HOUSE,
AND AT TWO A.M.

09:02.733 --> 09:03.933
YOU CALL YOUR
HOUSEKEEPER ?

09:03.967 --> 09:05.633
SHE WAS GONNA QUIT,
IT WAS A WHOLE HUGE THING.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.567
SHE'S HAVING BIG
PROBLEMS WITH CHERYL.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.133
CHERYL CAN'T
FIND ANYTHING.

09:09.167 --> 09:10.767
SHE COULDN'T FIND HER
PAJAMAS THE OTHER NIGHT.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.100
SO, SHE YELLED AT HER.

09:12.133 --> 09:14.100
AND SHE WAS GONNA QUIT AND I HAD
TO TALK HER OUT OF QUITTING.

09:14.133 --> 09:15.433
AT 2:00 IN
THE MORNING, LARRY ?

09:15.467 --> 09:17.633
WELL, SHE WAS QUITTING
THE NEXT DAY, I HAD TO, YEAH.

09:17.667 --> 09:19.833
YOU'RE LYING,
OR YOU'RE LYING.

09:19.867 --> 09:21.400
ONE OF YOU
TWO ASSHOLES IS LYING,

09:21.433 --> 09:23.067
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHICH ONE.

09:23.067 --> 09:24.700
WE'RE NOT LYING.
WE'RE NOT LYING.

09:24.733 --> 09:25.733
YEAH, YOU ARE.

09:25.767 --> 09:27.933
NO, WE'RE NOT.
NO, WE'RE NOT.

09:27.967 --> 09:30.533
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

09:30.567 --> 09:32.233
IT'S TRUE.
IT'S TRUE.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.600
PLEASE, I HAVE
THINGS TO DO, OKAY.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.733
ALRIGHT, LET'S GO TO
THE CLUB AND DO SOME TIPPING.

09:45.767 --> 09:47.067
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.367
A MERRY CHRISTMAS
TO YOU, MY FRIEND.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.200
THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING.

09:51.233 --> 09:52.833
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

09:57.633 --> 10:00.333
THANK YOU,
THAT'S VERY NICE.

10:07.433 --> 10:09.400
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

10:12.767 --> 10:14.033
THAT WAS GREAT.

10:14.067 --> 10:14.833
HOW'D YOU DO ?

10:14.867 --> 10:15.900
OH, BEAUTIFUL.

10:15.933 --> 10:17.867
IT FELT GOOD,
THEY'RE ALL HAPPY.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.133
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?

10:20.967 --> 10:23.167
DID...

10:23.200 --> 10:24.700
DID I TIP HIM ?

10:24.733 --> 10:28.067
I THINK I TIPPED
THAT GUY TWICE.

10:28.100 --> 10:28.733
NO.

10:28.767 --> 10:30.233
YEAH.

10:30.267 --> 10:31.833
NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS,
HE WOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING.

10:31.867 --> 10:33.267
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.600
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

10:34.633 --> 10:36.433
I WAS JUST GOING AROUND
TIPPING EVERYBODY,

10:36.467 --> 10:37.767
AND I GOT...

10:40.600 --> 10:42.233
I TIPPED HIM TWICE.

10:42.267 --> 10:42.833
REALLY ?

10:42.867 --> 10:43.500
YEAH, I, YEAH.

10:43.533 --> 10:44.600
I GOT CONFUSED.

10:44.633 --> 10:45.733
WHY WOULDN'T HE SAY
SOMETHING TO YOU THOUGH ?

10:45.767 --> 10:47.567
WHY, 'CAUSE HE MAKES
TWICE AS MUCH MONEY.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.533
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHY ?

10:48.567 --> 10:50.367
WELL, IT'S JUST,
YOU KNOW.

10:50.400 --> 10:55.633
HI, UH,
IT'S A LITTLE AWKWARD, BUT,

10:55.667 --> 10:58.733
YOU KNOW, I WAS GOING AROUND
GIVING OUT MY CHRISTMAS...

10:58.767 --> 11:00.067
YEAH, WELL,
THAT WAS VERY NICE.

11:00.067 --> 11:01.467
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

11:01.500 --> 11:05.067
WELL, YOU'RE VERY WELCOME,
BUT, UM, I'M SURE,

11:05.067 --> 11:06.600
YOU'RE NOT
AWARE OF THIS.

11:06.633 --> 11:11.167
BUT I THINK I INADVERTENTLY,
UH, TIPPED YOU TWICE.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.400
TWICE ?

11:12.433 --> 11:15.067
NO, NO, YOU CAME UP AND YOU
SAID, UH, MERRY CHRISTMAS,

11:15.100 --> 11:16.767
AND YOU GAVE ME SOME MONEY,
WHICH WAS VERY NICE,

11:16.800 --> 11:18.467
AND THEN
YOU WALKED ON.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.067
YEAH, AND I
DID THAT TWICE.

11:21.067 --> 11:23.867
NO, NO,
YOU DID IT ONCE.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.367
WELL, IT WAS TWICE.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.300
I'M SURE YOU
DIDN'T REALIZE IT.

11:27.333 --> 11:30.800
NO, I WOULD HAVE REALIZED IT,
IF IT HAD HAPPENED.

11:30.833 --> 11:33.400
BUT SINCE IT
DIDN'T HAPPEN, UH...

11:33.433 --> 11:36.733
SO, YOU'RE SAYING
I ONLY TIPPED YOU ONCE ?

11:36.767 --> 11:38.133
UH, YES.

11:38.167 --> 11:42.300
DO YOU WANT YOUR
FIRST TIP BACK ?

11:42.333 --> 11:43.667
NO, MM-MM.

11:43.700 --> 11:44.967
OKAY.

11:45.067 --> 11:48.900
I'D LIKE
MY SECOND TIP BACK.

11:48.933 --> 11:51.900
THERE WAS
NO SECOND TIP.

12:08.333 --> 12:11.200
A BIG GOLD BALL THERE.

12:12.867 --> 12:15.233
HERE, YEAH

12:15.267 --> 12:16.200
THAT'S PERFECT.

12:16.233 --> 12:17.667
YOU'VE GOT
YOUR GOLD TRIANGLE.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.567
I'M GONNA PUT
THIS ONE RIGHT IN HERE.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.933
LARRY, HI.

12:20.967 --> 12:21.800
HI, LARRY.

12:21.833 --> 12:24.433
LOOK, MERRY CHRISTMAS.

12:24.467 --> 12:25.433
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
YOU LIKE IT ?

12:25.467 --> 12:27.067
IT'S KIND OF BIG,
ISN'T IT ?

12:27.100 --> 12:28.100
YEAH, IT'S
A BIG ONE, YEAH.

12:28.133 --> 12:29.200
GRAB A BALL.

12:29.233 --> 12:30.933
JUST MAKE A HOOK,
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.

12:30.967 --> 12:31.833
MAKE A HOOK.

12:31.867 --> 12:33.133
UH, NO, MAYBE,
MAYBE LATER.

12:33.167 --> 12:34.367
AND IT WILL
HANG UP REALLY...

12:34.400 --> 12:36.200
IT'S, LIKE, THE BIGGEST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

12:36.233 --> 12:39.733
THE BIGGER THE BETTER.

12:39.767 --> 12:41.600
CHERYL'S IN THE KITCHEN,
BY THE WAY, WITH BECKY.

12:41.633 --> 12:42.400
YEAH,
THEY'RE BAKING.

12:42.433 --> 12:43.633
THEY'RE BAKING COOKIES.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.633
OH, HOW WONDERFUL.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.733
SO, DID YOU FINISH YOUR
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING YET ?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.333
NO, NOT QUITE.

12:49.367 --> 12:50.567

12:50.600 --> 12:51.933
WHAT'D YOU
GET CHERYL ?

12:51.967 --> 12:54.200
( whispering )
You can tell me.

12:54.233 --> 12:58.067
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I THINK I'M GONNA GIVE HER
MY GRANDFATHER'S TALUS.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.500
TALUS,
WHAT'S A TALUS ?

12:59.533 --> 13:00.633
I DON'T KNOW THAT.

13:00.667 --> 13:01.833
IT'S, LIKE, A SCARF.

13:01.867 --> 13:02.900
OH, HE'S GETTING
HER A SCARF.

13:02.933 --> 13:05.067
OH, SHE LOVES SCARVES,
IS THAT ALL ?

13:05.100 --> 13:06.967
YEAH.

13:07.067 --> 13:09.167
( clearing throat)

13:09.200 --> 13:10.933
GOT SOMETHING CAUGHT
IN YOUR THROAT ?

13:13.833 --> 13:15.367
GRAPE STEM.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.400
OH.

13:17.433 --> 13:19.200
OH, YEAH.

13:19.233 --> 13:20.833
WELL, HERE,
HAVE SOME...

13:20.867 --> 13:21.567
THAT'S OKAY.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.200
( clearing throat )

13:25.067 --> 13:27.367
OH, THIS DOESN'T
HAVE A HOOK.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.267
HI, BECKY.

13:28.300 --> 13:28.900
HOW ARE YOU ?

13:28.933 --> 13:29.833
GOOD.

13:29.867 --> 13:31.100
HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
HAPPY HOLIDAYS.

13:31.133 --> 13:32.067
HOW ARE YOU ?

13:32.067 --> 13:32.833
OKAY.

13:32.867 --> 13:34.233
HELLO, DARLING.

13:34.267 --> 13:36.667
HONEY, WHY CAN'T YOU
WEAR THE SCARF

13:36.700 --> 13:38.633
THAT DORA GAVE YOU
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY ?

13:38.667 --> 13:40.300
YOU KNOW,
THE RED ONE ?

13:40.333 --> 13:41.933
BECAUSE IT ITCHES ME.

13:41.967 --> 13:43.067
IT'S ITCHY.

13:43.067 --> 13:45.333
WELL, SHE BROUGHT IT
UP TO ME TODAY.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.800
SHE JUST FEELS LIKE,
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T CARE

13:47.833 --> 13:49.433
THAT SHE GAVE YOU
THIS LOVELY PRESENT.

13:52.433 --> 13:54.167
AND THEN SHE TOLD ME
THAT YOU YELLED AT HER

13:54.200 --> 13:58.700
FOR TELLING PEOPLE,
UH, WHERE YOU GO.

13:58.733 --> 14:00.733
I DIDN'T YELL AT HER,
WE HAD A TALK,

14:00.767 --> 14:04.467
BECAUSE MY DOCTOR HAD HEARD
THAT I WENT TO THE U2 CONCERT.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.600
YOU WENT TO
THE U2 CONCERT ?

14:07.633 --> 14:09.367
YOU KNOW, SHE DRAGGED ME
TO THE CONCERT

14:09.400 --> 14:11.133
SO I WENT TO THE CONCERT,
SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ?

14:11.167 --> 14:12.400
OKAY, AND LISTEN.

14:12.433 --> 14:15.633
AND SHE'S UPSET BECAUSE YOU
TIPPED CARLOS TWICE AS MUCH

14:15.667 --> 14:16.600
AS YOU TIPPED HER.

14:16.633 --> 14:18.700
WHAT ARE YOU CRAZY ?
I DIDN'T DO THAT.

14:18.733 --> 14:19.967
YOU TIPPED
OUR GARDENER TWICE.

14:20.067 --> 14:20.933
THAT'S REALLY
IN POOR FORM.

14:20.967 --> 14:21.967
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

14:22.067 --> 14:23.633
HE'S LYING,
JUST LIKE THE WAITER.

14:23.667 --> 14:24.100
WHAT ?

14:24.133 --> 14:24.833
AT THE CLUB.

14:24.867 --> 14:25.733
WHAT WAITER ?

14:25.767 --> 14:27.467
I GAVE THE SAME WAITER
A TIP TWICE,

14:27.500 --> 14:28.367
'CAUSE I DIDN'T
REMEMBER WHO...

14:28.400 --> 14:29.767
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THAT ?

14:29.800 --> 14:31.433
'CAUSE I WAS GOING AROUND
IN A CIRCLE TIPPING EVERYBODY.

14:31.467 --> 14:32.700
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO
TO TIP AND WHO NOT.

14:32.733 --> 14:35.167
I FORGOT WHO I TIPPED,
SO I TIPPED HIM TWICE.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.367
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU SHOULD DO.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.667
YOU SHOULD TAKE HER
TO LUNCH AT THE CLUB.

14:37.700 --> 14:39.433
THAT IS A REALLY
GOOD IDEA.

14:39.467 --> 14:41.433
TREAT HER TO
A VERY NICE LUNCH.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.833
WHAT IS IT, EVERYTHING SHE SAYS,
YOU GO ALONG WITH, HUH ?

14:43.867 --> 14:46.067
I WOULD LIKE IT IF YOU TOOK ME
OUT TO LUNCH IS ALL I'M SAYING.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.300
YOU CAN DISAGREE
WITH HER ONCE.

14:47.333 --> 14:50.067
SHE HAPPENS TO THINK THAT
I'M RIGHT MOST OF THE TIME.

14:50.067 --> 14:52.633
SO, DO YOU REALLY THINK
I SHOULD TAKE HER TO LUNCH ?

14:52.667 --> 14:54.933
OH, HONEY, IT WOULD
MEAN SO MUCH TO HER.

14:54.967 --> 14:56.767
OKAY.

14:56.800 --> 14:57.700
IT'S A HOLIDAY.

14:57.733 --> 14:58.767
I'LL TAKE HER TO LUNCH.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.133
I THINK
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

15:00.167 --> 15:02.867
NICE TREE BY THE WAY.

15:02.900 --> 15:03.667
THANK YOU.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.200
CARLOS.

15:10.233 --> 15:12.267
OH, SéNOR LARRY.

15:12.300 --> 15:13.733
CARLOS, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

15:13.767 --> 15:16.800
DID YOU TELL DORA

15:16.833 --> 15:20.300
THAT YOU GOT A BIGGER
CHRISTMAS BONUS THAN HER ?

15:20.333 --> 15:22.700
NO.

15:22.733 --> 15:26.700
'CAUSE SHE TOLD MY WIFE
THAT YOU SAID THAT.

15:26.733 --> 15:29.900
NO, SéNOR.

15:29.933 --> 15:33.267
WHY WOULD SHE MAKE UP
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

15:33.300 --> 15:35.900
NO Sé.

15:35.933 --> 15:39.667
DON'T YOU FIND
THAT CURIOUS ?

15:39.700 --> 15:41.667
NO, SéNOR.

15:57.600 --> 16:01.500
( "We Wish You
A Merry Christmas" playing )

16:16.300 --> 16:18.867
YOU KNOW
WHAT I LOVE ?

16:18.900 --> 16:23.300
I LOVE HOW YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE
GONNA RUN OUT OF SOY MILK.

16:23.333 --> 16:24.433
YOU ANTICIPATE IT.

16:24.467 --> 16:26.267
AND THEN YOU PUT A NEW ONE
IN THE REFRIGERATOR,

16:26.300 --> 16:28.067
SO THERE'S ALWAYS
A COLD ONE IN THERE.

16:28.067 --> 16:29.500
I NOTICE THAT.

16:29.533 --> 16:31.500
OKAY, MR. LARRY.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.967
YOU'RE A GOOD FOLDER.

16:37.067 --> 16:39.600
VERY GOOD FOLDER.

16:39.633 --> 16:41.733
PARTICULARLY
WITH THE T-SHIRTS.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.733
THERE'S THAT LITTLE KIND
OF THING YOU DO AT THE END,

16:43.767 --> 16:44.900
YOU FLIP THEM OVER.

16:44.933 --> 16:48.867
PUT IN THE ARMS, TAKE IT,
LIKE, FLIPPED OVER.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.667
LIKE A LITTLE PENGUIN.

16:51.700 --> 16:53.133
OKAY.

16:53.167 --> 16:54.900
I SEE THAT,
I NOTICE THE FOLDING.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.700
THE TOILET PAPER...

16:58.733 --> 17:02.167
OKAY, LET'S DISCUSS
THE TOILET PAPER.

17:02.200 --> 17:06.533
I AM NEVER IN THAT BATHROOM
LOOKIN' AT CARDBOARD.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.600
AS SOON AS IT RUNS OUT,
YOU'VE GOT THE NEW ROLL.

17:09.633 --> 17:11.500
I'M NEVER RUNNING
OUT OF THERE WITH MY PANTS

17:11.533 --> 17:13.933
AT MY ANKLES SCREAMING,
THERE'S NO TOILET PAPER.

17:13.967 --> 17:14.800
MM.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.933
WHAT ELSE,
WHAT ELSE DO YOU DO ?

17:16.967 --> 17:19.533
TOILET PAPER...

17:19.567 --> 17:22.100
FOLDING...

17:22.133 --> 17:23.967
SOY MILK.

17:25.300 --> 17:28.333
YOUR SPONGE REPLACEMENT'S
NOT SO HOT.

17:28.367 --> 17:30.267
IF I CAN SPEAK FRANKLY.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.367
OKAY, MR. LARRY.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.167
FINISHED ?

17:36.200 --> 17:37.867
NO, NO.

17:37.900 --> 17:39.100
OKAY.

17:39.133 --> 17:41.900
SéNORITA,
ALGO MAS ?

17:41.933 --> 17:43.067
NO, GRACIAS.

17:43.067 --> 17:56.267
( speaking Spanish )

18:00.700 --> 18:03.467
WHAT WAS, UH,
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT ?

18:03.500 --> 18:06.233
CHRISTMAS.

18:14.767 --> 18:15.667
HI.

18:15.700 --> 18:16.767
HI, UH, GREENE.

18:16.800 --> 18:17.767
HEY.

18:17.800 --> 18:18.833
HEY.

18:18.867 --> 18:20.133
OH, LARRY'S HERE.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.200
HI, LAR.

18:21.233 --> 18:21.733
LOOKIE, LOOKIE.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.533
HEY, HI, SAMMIE.

18:23.567 --> 18:24.467
HI, LARRY.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.600
SUSIE.

18:25.633 --> 18:26.633
HI.

18:26.667 --> 18:29.100
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET DORA,
MY HOUSEKEEPER.

18:29.133 --> 18:30.100
HELLO.

18:30.133 --> 18:31.200
THIS IS YOUR
HOUSEKEEPER DORA ?

18:31.233 --> 18:34.300
OH, ALRIGHT,
ALRIGHT, LOOK.

18:34.333 --> 18:35.467
ALRIGHT.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.200
I MADE A MISTAKE,
I'M SORRY, I APOLOGIZE.

18:37.233 --> 18:38.433
YOU SURE DID.

18:38.467 --> 18:41.133
ALRIGHT, I APOLOGIZE
PROFUSELY TO BOTH OF YOU.

18:41.167 --> 18:42.433
MAYBE NEXT TIME YOU
WON'T JUMP DOWN MY THROAT.

18:42.467 --> 18:44.333
WELL, I JUST,
I WAS THINKING CRAZY THINGS.

18:44.367 --> 18:46.067
YOU INSULTED ME,
YOU INSULTED MY FRIEND.

18:46.100 --> 18:48.067
I KNOW, BUT I THOUGHT YOU
WERE TALKING TO A WOMAN.

18:48.100 --> 18:49.200
LARRY, I'M SO SORRY.

18:49.233 --> 18:51.367
FRANKLY,
I WAS PRETTY INSULTED.

18:51.400 --> 18:51.833
OKAY.

18:51.867 --> 18:52.767
JEFF.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.067
HEY, CHRIS,
HOW YOU DOING ?

18:55.067 --> 18:55.967
PRETTY DARN GOOD.

18:56.067 --> 18:56.633
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

18:56.667 --> 18:57.500
LARRY.

18:57.533 --> 18:58.567
CHRISTOPHER.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.300
WHERE'S THAT 20 BUCKS ?

19:00.333 --> 19:02.667
YOU SEEM LIKE
SUCH A LOVELY WOMAN.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.633
I DON'T KNOW WHY CHERYL
DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

19:04.667 --> 19:06.100
I'M SURE IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOUR WORK.

19:06.133 --> 19:08.467
I'M SURE YOUR WORK IS TERRIFIC,
'CAUSE I'VE SEEN THE HOUSE.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.067
IS THE BEST COINCIDENCE,
THAT I...

19:10.100 --> 19:11.500
WHAT ARE THE ODDS ?

19:11.533 --> 19:12.633
I KNOW,
WHAT ARE THE ODDS ?

19:12.667 --> 19:13.700
WHAT ARE THE ODDS,
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

19:13.733 --> 19:14.700
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

19:14.733 --> 19:16.133
YOU ARE HUNGRY,
WE'LL GET DADDY.

19:16.167 --> 19:17.833
HONEY,
SAMMIE'S HUNGRY.

19:17.867 --> 19:18.933
OKAY, LET'S GO.

19:18.967 --> 19:20.067
GOOD, COME ON, SAMMIE.

19:20.067 --> 19:21.067
AND LAR, AGAIN,

19:21.100 --> 19:23.467
I APOLOGIZE.

19:24.567 --> 19:25.633
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.

19:25.667 --> 19:26.367
I KNOW.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.167
SOMETHING WRONG ?

19:35.500 --> 19:37.967
IS IT THE SPONGE THING ?

19:38.067 --> 19:46.233
* OH COME, OH YE FAITHFUL,
JOYFUL AND TRIUMPHANT *

19:46.267 --> 19:52.533
* OH COME YE, OH COME YE

19:52.567 --> 20:00.167
* COME AND BEHOLD HIM
BORN THE KING OF ANGELS *

20:00.200 --> 20:03.733
* OH COME LET US
ADORE HIM *

20:03.767 --> 20:07.233
* OH COME
LET US ADORE HIM *

20:07.267 --> 20:14.267
* OH COME LET US ADORE HIM,
CHRIST THE LORD *

20:14.300 --> 20:20.633
* YE LORD, WE GREET THEE,
BORN THIS HAPPY MORNING *

20:20.667 --> 20:24.133
* JESUS TO THE THEE BE...

20:24.167 --> 20:25.333
COME ON.

20:25.367 --> 20:27.133
HEY, LARRY, JOIN US.

20:27.167 --> 20:28.700
I DON'T THINK SO,
THANK YOU.

20:28.733 --> 20:29.833
THE WORDS ARE
RIGHT HERE.

20:29.867 --> 20:31.133
WE GOT THEM OFF
THE INTERNET, LARRY,

20:31.167 --> 20:32.167
THEY'RE A
LITTLE DIFFERENT.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.100
HOW MUCH LONGER
DO YOU THINK

20:33.133 --> 20:34.500
THE CAROLING'S GONNA
GO ON TONIGHT ?

20:35.567 --> 20:36.733
WHATEVER.

20:36.767 --> 20:37.600
WE DON'T KNOW.

20:37.633 --> 20:39.967
( clearing throat )

20:40.733 --> 20:42.267
LARRY.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.100
CAN I SEE YOU
FOR A SECOND ?

20:44.133 --> 20:45.167
SURE.

20:48.033 --> 20:51.100
* OH COME LET US
ADORE HIM *

20:51.133 --> 20:53.067
* OH COME
LET US ADORE HIM *

20:53.100 --> 20:54.533
WHAT'S UP ?

20:54.567 --> 20:56.300
WELL, DORA QUIT.

20:56.333 --> 20:57.367
WHAT ?

20:57.400 --> 20:59.133
YEAH, I ASKED HER WHY,
AND SHE SAID,

20:59.167 --> 21:02.900
SUSIE GREENE TOLD HER
THAT I DON'T LIKE HER.

21:02.933 --> 21:04.967
SO, I JUST
TALKED TO SUSIE,

21:05.067 --> 21:06.500
TO FIND OUT WHAT
EXACTLY WAS GOING ON.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.700
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

21:07.733 --> 21:11.700
AND SUSIE TELLS ME
THIS STORY ABOUT, UH,

21:11.733 --> 21:13.933
US GETTING
IN A FIGHT AND...

21:13.967 --> 21:16.167
UH, YOU'RE SPENDING
THE NIGHT OVER THERE,

21:16.200 --> 21:17.967
AND YOU'RE CALLING DORA.

21:18.067 --> 21:22.300
AND I TOLD SUSIE THAT YOU
AND JEFF ARE FULL OF SHIT.

21:22.333 --> 21:29.900
* THE LITTLE LORD JESUS
LAY DOWN HIS SWEET HEAD *

21:29.933 --> 21:36.233
* THE STARS IN THE SKY
LOOK DOWN WHERE HE LAY *

21:36.267 --> 21:42.300
* THE LITTLE LORD JESUS
ASLEEP IN THE HAY *

21:42.333 --> 21:44.467
LARRY !

21:47.600 --> 21:49.300
LARRY !

21:49.867 --> 21:51.100
WHAT ?

21:55.633 --> 21:56.700
WHAT ?

21:56.733 --> 21:57.900
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE COOKIES ?

21:57.933 --> 21:58.700
WHAT ?

21:58.733 --> 22:00.200
THE COOKIES !

22:00.233 --> 22:03.167
THE COOKIES FROM--
WHAT, FROM LAST NIGHT ?

22:03.200 --> 22:03.800
YEAH.

22:03.833 --> 22:04.933
WHAT, I ATE THEM.

22:04.967 --> 22:07.333
WELL, YOU ATE THEM ?

22:07.367 --> 22:09.100
THEY WERE FOR
THE MANGER SCENE.

22:09.133 --> 22:11.933
THERE, YOU ATE THE BABY JESUS
AND HIS MOTHER MARY.

22:11.967 --> 22:13.333
I THOUGHT THEY
WERE ANIMAL COOKIES.

22:13.367 --> 22:14.233
ANIMAL COOKIES ?

22:14.267 --> 22:15.533
OH, WHAT ARE
YOU KIDDING ?

22:15.567 --> 22:17.333
JESUS CHRIST
IS NOT AN ANIMAL !

22:17.367 --> 22:19.067
I THOUGHT
HE WAS A MONKEY.

22:19.067 --> 22:20.200
A MONKEY ?

22:20.233 --> 22:21.067
OH, PLEASE !

22:21.067 --> 22:22.567
( all shouting at once )

22:22.600 --> 22:24.067
THE SON OF GOD
WAS A MONKEY ?

22:24.067 --> 22:25.500
WE WORKED ALL DAY
ON THOSE COOKIES.

22:25.533 --> 22:26.700
I'M SORRY.

22:26.733 --> 22:29.900
YOU DIDN'T SEE THE HAY,
THE TOASTED COCONUT WAS HAY.

22:29.933 --> 22:31.167
THE BARN.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.567
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
ALL PART OF THE ZOO.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.400
WHY WOULD WE HAVE
A ZOO ON CHRISTMAS DAY ?!

22:35.433 --> 22:37.400
OKAY, UH...

22:37.433 --> 22:39.267
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.733
HOW ARE YOU GONNA MAKE
IT UP TO US, LARRY, OKAY ?

22:40.767 --> 22:42.067
YOU JUST SWALLOWED
OUR LORD AND SAVIOR.

22:42.067 --> 22:43.067
I'LL MAKE IT UP.

22:43.067 --> 22:44.167
I'LL GO GET ANOTHER
MANGER SCENE.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.167
YEAH, WHERE ?

22:45.200 --> 22:46.867
NOTHING'S OPEN,
IT'S CHRISTMAS.

22:46.900 --> 22:50.300
OKAY, WE'RE GOING
TO GO VISIT OUR COUSIN.

22:50.833 --> 22:52.067
I'M SORRY.

22:52.067 --> 22:52.900
YEAH.

22:52.933 --> 22:54.233
I'M SORRY, I'LL MAKE
IT UP TO YOU.

22:54.267 --> 22:55.467
OH, MY GOD.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.633
( clearing throat )

22:58.667 --> 23:00.700
YOU'D BETTER
LOOK INTO THAT.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.700
YOU LYING
PIECE OF SHIT !

23:10.733 --> 23:11.833
OUT OF MY HOUSE !

23:11.867 --> 23:12.833
WHY ?

23:12.867 --> 23:14.067
OUT OF MY HOUSE !

23:14.067 --> 23:15.067
I DIDN'T LIE.

23:15.067 --> 23:16.067
OH, YOU LIED.

23:16.067 --> 23:17.433
I DIDN'T LIE.

23:17.467 --> 23:19.367
AND WAIT 'TIL I GET MY HANDS
ON THAT GODDAMN LARRY DAVID,

23:19.400 --> 23:21.200
THE FOUR-EYED FUCK.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.067
I'LL KILL HIM !

23:23.900 --> 23:26.967
( clearing throat )

23:39.467 --> 23:41.867
WE ARE HUMBLE,
SIMPLE PEOPLE.

23:41.900 --> 23:45.067
I KNOW YOU
HAVE TRAVELED FAR.

23:47.367 --> 23:48.667
EXCUSE ME.

23:48.700 --> 23:50.600
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND ?

23:51.933 --> 23:53.933
JUST CONTINUE.

23:53.967 --> 23:55.400
HOW YOU DOING ?

23:55.433 --> 23:56.467
HELLO.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.367
HI, UH...

23:58.400 --> 23:59.700
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

23:59.733 --> 24:03.267
HOW CAN I, UH,
GO ABOUT, UH,

24:03.300 --> 24:05.200
RENTING ONE OF
THESE MANGER GROUPS ?

24:05.233 --> 24:06.833
OH, RENTING ?

24:06.867 --> 24:09.667
WE'RE A VOLUNTEER GROUP
WITH THE CHURCH.

24:09.700 --> 24:10.800
SO...

24:10.833 --> 24:13.067
I'M KIND OF IN A BIND.

24:13.067 --> 24:16.733
IT'S CHRISTMAS DAY,
WE HAVE NO MANGER SCENE.

24:16.767 --> 24:18.733
IS IT A MANGER SCENE ?

24:18.767 --> 24:20.400
NATIVITY,
CERTAINLY A MANGER.

24:20.433 --> 24:21.900
WE DON'T HAVE
A NATIVITY SCENE IN MY HOUSE.

24:21.933 --> 24:23.633
WE HAD ONE
BUT I ATE IT.

24:23.667 --> 24:27.333
THEY WERE COOKIES, AND,
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT I COULD,

24:27.367 --> 24:30.067
I COULD GET YOUR GROUP
TO GO TO MY HOUSE ?

24:30.100 --> 24:32.100
TODAY ?

24:32.133 --> 24:32.867
YES.

24:32.900 --> 24:33.833
OH, IT'S CHRISTMAS.

24:33.867 --> 24:34.867
YEAH, I KNOW.

24:34.900 --> 24:36.067
UH, WOW.

24:36.067 --> 24:37.333
JUST FOR
A COUPLE OF HOURS.

24:37.367 --> 24:38.400
LIKE, THREE,
FOUR HOURS.

24:38.433 --> 24:39.500
OH, I SEE.

24:39.533 --> 24:41.500
WELL, ACTUALLY, WE DO
HAVE A BREAK COMING UP.

24:41.533 --> 24:45.367
WE COULD PROBABLY
SEE OUR WAY TO YOUR HOME.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.267
YOU KNOW, I OBVIOUSLY
WE WOULD WORK SOMETHING OUT.

24:48.300 --> 24:50.267
OH, GREAT, A DONATION
FOR THE CHURCH

24:50.300 --> 24:51.833
WOULD BE A CAPITAL THING.

24:51.867 --> 24:53.067
FINE, A DONATION.

24:53.100 --> 24:54.833
GREAT, YES.

24:54.867 --> 24:57.600
OKAY, UM...

24:57.633 --> 25:00.433
WELL, WE'D HAVE TO MAYBE
DISCUSS THE DONATION.

25:00.467 --> 25:01.967
WHATEVER YOU
THINK IS FAIR.

25:02.067 --> 25:03.367
WHAT DO YOU
THINK IS FAIR ?

25:03.400 --> 25:06.300
HUH, I DON'T
REALLY WANT TO SAY,

25:06.333 --> 25:08.267
BUT I GUESS
I'M FORCED TO.

25:08.300 --> 25:10.767
$500...

25:10.800 --> 25:14.067
AND A MEAL OF COURSE,

25:14.100 --> 25:15.767
BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT
TO HAVE A LUNCH.

25:15.800 --> 25:16.900
I DON'T REALLY COOK.

25:16.933 --> 25:18.133
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
TAKE OUT, YOU KNOW.

25:18.167 --> 25:20.400
THAT'S FINE.

25:20.433 --> 25:22.700
OKAY, $500, FINE.

25:22.733 --> 25:23.933
I'LL GIVE YOU $500.

25:23.967 --> 25:25.433
AND THE MEAL.

25:25.467 --> 25:26.600
I DON'T MEAN TO PUSH.

25:26.633 --> 25:27.667
AND A MEAL.

25:27.700 --> 25:28.600
OKAY, WHICH ONE,
WHICH ONE ARE YOU ?

25:28.633 --> 25:30.233
JOSEPH, LARRY.
I'M JOSEPH.

25:30.267 --> 25:32.067
HELLO, LARRY.

25:32.067 --> 25:33.067
PLEASURE.
HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.

25:34.467 --> 25:36.300
SO YEAH,
I JUST, UH...
