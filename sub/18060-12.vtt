00:03.253 --> 00:05.255
The four of us are no match
for Jafar's magic.

<i>his power is gonna be unstoppable.</i>

00:09.051 --> 00:11.220
So, let's begin.

00:12.471 --> 00:13.847
Let me look at you.

00:14.264 --> 00:18.060
My three brave, beautiful sons.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.521
I had a partner. Her name was Amara.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.940
<i>I found another use for her.</i>

00:24.191 --> 00:25.442
The needle, it's following you.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.528
Is it following me,
or is it following the staff?

00:27.694 --> 00:29.863
<i>My mother always said it would</i>
<i>one day lead me back to her.</i>

00:30.113 --> 00:31.240
This might sting a bit.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.450
(SCREAMS)

00:33.534 --> 00:34.785
She's made her wishes.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.578
I have no reason to keep her alive.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.288
No, no!

00:38.705 --> 00:41.124
No, no!

00:45.754 --> 00:48.507
JAFAR: Love makes us do
the maddest things, doesn't it?

00:49.091 --> 00:50.092
Go away.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.846
JAFAR: She risked so much to get you back.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.723
Pity it didn't work out.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.017
Yeah, pity.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.605
JAFAR: She does look beautiful, though.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.279
Like she's only asleep.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.586
Like you could almost reach out
and wake her up...

01:25.669 --> 01:26.670
Leave her alone!

01:29.381 --> 01:31.967
I like you with your heart in your chest.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.263
I imagine you must want
to kill me for what I did.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.141
Why don't you open this door
and we'll find out?

01:39.766 --> 01:41.727
Haven't you tortured him enough?

01:42.060 --> 01:43.687
Show the boy some mercy!

01:44.021 --> 01:45.022
Mercy?

01:45.272 --> 01:47.816
And I suppose you'd be
the expert on that subject?

01:48.275 --> 01:50.777
I've learned the error of my ways.

01:51.904 --> 01:54.781
But I'm waiting for you
to learn anything at all!

01:55.490 --> 01:58.202
I'm going to give him something
better than mercy, Father.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.537
I'm going to give him hope.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.208
If he agrees to one small favor.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.376
(SPITS)

02:07.294 --> 02:09.963
If you think I'll ever help you,
you're madder than the Hatter.

02:12.758 --> 02:13.967
You know, when I was a young boy,

02:14.051 --> 02:15.344
I lost someone I loved.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.601
And I can still remember
exactly how it felt.

02:24.770 --> 02:25.896
The cold rushing in,

02:26.355 --> 02:28.857
like the fabric of the world
had ripped in half.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.822
What If I told you there was a way

02:35.906 --> 02:37.658
to sew it back together again?

02:38.033 --> 02:39.576
To bring back Anastasia?

02:40.452 --> 02:42.120
I'd say you were a lying bastard.

02:44.248 --> 02:45.249
Half right.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.876
But ask yourself...

02:48.710 --> 02:51.672
What if there is a chance,
no matter how small,

02:53.382 --> 02:54.466
to see her again?

02:57.261 --> 02:58.679
She risked everything for you.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.639
Don't you think you owe her the same?

03:01.056 --> 03:02.933
Don't listen to him, boy.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.770
JAFAR: Oh, I think
he'll do more than listen.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.523
Give a man the proper motivation,

03:09.606 --> 03:11.441
there's no telling what he might do.

this is just lovely, isn't it?

03:21.535 --> 03:22.995
Tromping through the cold with you lads.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.706
Anyone know a good marching song? No?

03:27.416 --> 03:28.667
I don't know what I enjoy more,

03:28.750 --> 03:30.002
the frostbite or the conversation.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.545
Stop talking.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.629
I'd like to stop walking,

03:32.713 --> 03:35.132
but the Queen of Hearts
ordered me to... (CHOKES)

03:35.799 --> 03:36.842
Listen, Knave.

03:37.259 --> 03:39.303
We're hunting the most dangerous
criminal in Wonderland...

03:39.845 --> 03:42.472
Killed plenty of men, women, children.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.850
Been evading my men for weeks,

03:45.100 --> 03:46.310
trained soldiers.

03:46.894 --> 03:50.272
So tell me, how are you going to help us?

03:50.731 --> 03:51.857
By paying attention.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.025
To what?

03:53.108 --> 03:54.109
Campfire you're standing in.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.076
We're close.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.161
Spread out.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.662
And show no mercy.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.165
Because you'll get none from this monster.

(RUSTLING)

04:52.709 --> 04:55.671
And you're a little young
to be a murderer.

A murderer?

(SIGHS)

04:58.423 --> 04:59.967
Is that what
the Queen of Hearts says I am?

05:00.217 --> 05:02.219
She used a few other nasty words, as well.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.471
But, given the circumstances,
I hope she's wrong.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.639
She's wrong.

05:11.186 --> 05:14.439
You need to be a little bit more selective
with who you take orders from, soldier.

05:14.523 --> 05:15.524
I'm not a soldier.

05:15.691 --> 05:16.692
Then who are you?

05:16.775 --> 05:17.776
I don't have to tell.

05:18.902 --> 05:19.903
Who are you?

05:22.155 --> 05:23.407
The Queen's Knave.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.034
A knave?

05:27.953 --> 05:29.454
Kind of like a court jester?

05:29.997 --> 05:30.998
No.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.125
More like a Jack-of-all-trades, actually.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.751
But, apparently, a master of none.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.337
Watch your tongue, lass. Else you'll lose
that as well as your head.

05:37.421 --> 05:38.964
That's a little redundant,
don't you think?

05:39.047 --> 05:40.299
Depends which one you lose first.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.719
See you around, Knave of Hearts.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.388

06:00.652 --> 06:01.904
Alice, you have to understand.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.615
I do understand. I just don't agree.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.284
To defeat Jafar, we need to free
my brothers from their bottles,

06:07.743 --> 06:08.827
But to do that...

06:08.911 --> 06:11.705
BOTH: We need to return the stolen
water to the Well of Wonders.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.459
And you believe that that water
is in Jafar's staff.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.003
Yes. If my mother's in there,
the water rests with her.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.047
Well, let's free her first.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.924
If I had a chance
to speak with my mother again,

06:22.007 --> 06:24.301
-I would do anything.
-I defied the fates once before,

06:24.384 --> 06:26.678
and was cursed into a bottle
for hundreds of years.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.347

She's dead, Alice.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.875
Anastasia, she's dead.
Jafar stabbed her right in front of me.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.043
Put me heart back in me chest,

06:58.126 --> 07:00.754
and made me watch her die
right there on the ground.

07:02.673 --> 07:03.674

Of course I do.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.688
There's something you can do, actually.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.107
I mean a way to truly,
really make things better.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.191
Well, tell me.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.735
Remember when I said anything's
possible in Wonderland?

07:23.819 --> 07:25.863
Well, it turns out I was right.

We can bring Anastasia back to life.

why I keep sparing your life

trying to take mine.

the same thing,

-You mean you asked her to?
-It's a long story.

-Obvious to who?
-A thief.

we've been trying to prevent.

-Have you got a better one?
-Will, we want to help.

see either of you doing anything.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.087
Please.

If you're any mate of mine,
you'd hand that thing over.

You know we can't.

We can't.

So, that's how it is, then?

Will, think.

Even if Jafar kept his end of the bargain,

-which he won't...
-You don't know that.

10:55.948 --> 10:58.534
Well, if he did, then what?

10:58.617 --> 10:59.868
Yes, Ana would be alive,

10:59.952 --> 11:02.204
but what about all the people
that will die because of it?

11:02.287 --> 11:05.749

as Jafar that kind of power.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.004
I just can't do that.

11:19.638 --> 11:20.722
You're right.

11:20.806 --> 11:22.391
-Will...
-No, it's okay. You're right.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.726
I was thinking with my heart
and not with my head.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.228
I haven't had the option in a while.

11:27.271 --> 11:30.357
I guess sometimes you just need
a friend to set you straight.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.570
Would you want to come with us?

11:34.653 --> 11:35.654
Where to?

11:35.737 --> 11:36.947
The Well of Wonders,

11:37.030 --> 11:39.491
where this all started
and where it's gonna end.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.578
I guess I could go on one last adventure,

11:42.661 --> 11:45.789
get some fresh air before Jafar
brings me back to that bottle.

11:45.998 --> 11:47.374
For old times' sake?

11:47.457 --> 11:48.542
Sounds just perfect.

11:54.006 --> 11:55.465
(JABBERWOCKY SNIFFING)

11:55.549 --> 11:59.052
Did you know that everyone's
fear has its own unique scent?

11:59.845 --> 12:03.682
Yours, Jafar, smells like pine needles

12:04.850 --> 12:05.851
in the snow.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.274
Sneak up on me again,

12:12.357 --> 12:14.985
and I'll pin you to the ceiling
for another 1,000 years.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.069
If you're tired of me,

12:16.153 --> 12:18.572
why not just give me the Vorpal blade

12:19.990 --> 12:21.241
like you promised,

12:21.617 --> 12:22.868
and I'll be on my way?

12:23.035 --> 12:25.746
You'll get this back
when I finish the spell,

12:25.829 --> 12:26.914
not before.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.707
Your words say one thing,

12:29.333 --> 12:31.168
but your fear says another.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.381
You're worried you won't be able
to complete the spell,

12:36.465 --> 12:38.634
because you need
another sorcerer for that.

12:38.884 --> 12:44.348
You're wondering why
the staff wouldn't harm Cyrus...

12:45.474 --> 12:47.309
Afraid it might have something to do

12:47.392 --> 12:48.644
with the one inside it...

12:49.811 --> 12:50.979
Amara.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.525
You mistake curiosity for fear.

12:56.151 --> 12:59.321
You know what the difference is
between you and me?

12:59.404 --> 13:01.073
I don't need to get inside your head

13:01.156 --> 13:02.950
to know what you're afraid of.

13:04.493 --> 13:07.871
You wear it on
that tortured face of yours.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.669
You're afraid I won't live up
to my end of the bargain,

13:14.711 --> 13:17.589
and you'll be my slave for
as long as we both shall live.

13:21.218 --> 13:24.388
The thought had crossed my mind.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.723
Good.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.769
Let's see if there's a way
for you to keep my fears from coming true.

13:31.395 --> 13:32.604
And then maybe...

13:33.355 --> 13:35.190
Just maybe

13:36.900 --> 13:39.486
I'll consider doing the same for yours.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.855
Careful. If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were trying to steal that.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.440
Let go of my hand, mate.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.360
You know Alice trusts you.

14:20.444 --> 14:22.112
-You don't.
-Obviously.

14:22.196 --> 14:24.198
It'll break her heart
to find out about this.

14:24.615 --> 14:25.949
She's a tough girl. She'll be fine.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.619
How about you get back to bed,

14:28.702 --> 14:30.704
and we pretend like it never happened?

14:30.787 --> 14:32.331
I was never really good at pretending.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.050
Three, two, one...

15:07.866 --> 15:09.201
(MOUTHING)

15:15.123 --> 15:16.750
(MOUTHING)

15:30.389 --> 15:31.390
Lovely.

15:31.473 --> 15:34.309
Now, which one of these drawers
holds the Knave's heart?

15:37.479 --> 15:39.523
3-H. 7-S.

15:41.483 --> 15:42.693
What is this?

15:42.776 --> 15:44.528
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

15:45.028 --> 15:46.655
Oh, it's a deck of cards.

15:48.782 --> 15:51.410
Three of hearts,
seven of spades...

15:51.994 --> 15:53.203
The "K"...

15:53.287 --> 15:54.496
"K" would be for "King."

15:54.746 --> 15:56.415
So what's the Knave?

15:58.083 --> 15:59.126
He'd be...

16:03.255 --> 16:04.590
The Jack-of-all-Trades.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.091
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

16:11.597 --> 16:13.223
(HEART BEATING)

16:13.307 --> 16:14.308
Alice, wake up.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.393
What? What happened?

16:19.688 --> 16:20.856
Oh, no.

16:22.816 --> 16:23.859
How long ago?

16:25.194 --> 16:26.528
A few minutes at most.

16:26.612 --> 16:28.071
I can't believe he just...

16:29.448 --> 16:31.533
It's my fault. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have trusted him.

16:31.617 --> 16:33.035
You put your faith in a friend.

16:33.118 --> 16:34.661
This was his mistake, not yours.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.788
Fortunately, he made another mistake.

16:37.915 --> 16:39.124
He left us with this.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.001
The lost and found.

16:41.084 --> 16:43.587
As long as he has the staff,
this'll lead us right to him.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.380
And what do we do if we catch him?

16:45.464 --> 16:47.132
When we catch him,

16:47.216 --> 16:49.593
we ask him politely to return it to us.

16:49.927 --> 16:50.928
And if he doesn't?

16:52.513 --> 16:53.597
We take it back.

17:18.830 --> 17:19.998
RAFI: What do you want?

17:20.082 --> 17:21.708
Who says I want anything?

17:21.792 --> 17:24.127
In all these years,
you never once let us out of the bottles.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.672
That's because I was
never interested in you.

17:31.176 --> 17:32.177
But I am now.

17:39.643 --> 17:40.686
I'm curious.

17:41.812 --> 17:44.356
There was a woman who first
taught me about genies.

17:47.317 --> 17:48.485
Her name was Amara.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.240
Have you ever heard of her?

17:55.158 --> 17:56.159
Never.

17:56.577 --> 17:57.578
Are you sure?

17:58.453 --> 18:00.747
She'd been searching for you
for quite some time.

18:00.831 --> 18:01.957
So have many others.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.460
Indeed.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.260
Wait.

18:13.385 --> 18:14.720
Is that all you wanted?

18:15.762 --> 18:16.763
I'm afraid it is.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.184
I didn't bring you out
for your conversation.

18:21.727 --> 18:23.687
All I really needed
was to get a look at you.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.700
(PANTING)

18:38.160 --> 18:39.244
Oh, bollocks.

18:40.329 --> 18:42.039
Let's go this way. Go this way.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.124
Left.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.251
Right.

18:46.585 --> 18:47.920
Wait. No, left again.

18:50.506 --> 18:51.882
Was it...

18:58.263 --> 18:59.306
Double bollocks.

19:00.432 --> 19:01.433
Left.

19:02.976 --> 19:03.977
Right.

19:04.061 --> 19:05.604
He's taking a very strange route.

19:05.687 --> 19:07.397
Navigation was never his strong suit.

19:07.856 --> 19:09.066
There! I see him!

19:09.399 --> 19:10.400
ALICE: Will, wait!

19:10.484 --> 19:12.027
Split up! We can box him in!

19:20.327 --> 19:22.079
(GASPS)

19:27.417 --> 19:28.627
(GASPS)

19:28.710 --> 19:29.711
Hi, Alice.

19:29.795 --> 19:30.796
(SIGHS)

19:30.879 --> 19:31.922
Hi, Will.

19:33.924 --> 19:36.051
I guess you're not as clumsy
as you used to be.

19:41.849 --> 19:43.016
So, what now?

19:45.519 --> 19:47.229
I know it doesn't make any sense.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.981
I'm not saying it does, but I love her.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.065
I understand.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.149
Do you?

19:51.650 --> 19:52.776
I finally got my heart back,

19:52.860 --> 19:54.194
and you're asking me not to use it.

19:55.863 --> 19:57.614
I went to the ends of the earth
for you and Cyrus,

19:57.698 --> 19:59.032
risked me neck a dozen times.

19:59.116 --> 20:00.784
-That was different.
-Why?

20:00.868 --> 20:01.869
Why is it different?

20:01.952 --> 20:02.995
(SIGHS)

20:03.161 --> 20:04.663
You know what your problem is?

20:05.831 --> 20:08.166
You think your love story
is the only one worth fighting for.

20:10.794 --> 20:11.795
Don't follow me.

20:16.508 --> 20:17.509
Will, wait!

20:17.593 --> 20:18.886
(GASPS)

20:19.011 --> 20:20.304
(WATER SPLASHES)

20:24.641 --> 20:25.767
Alice!

20:28.020 --> 20:29.730
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

20:40.157 --> 20:41.575
(SIGHS)

20:45.913 --> 20:46.914
You saved me.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.625
You'd have done the same for me.

20:50.042 --> 20:52.920
You have done the same for me,
now that I think about it.

20:55.214 --> 20:56.965
I thought you didn't know how to swim.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.552
I don't know how to lose you, either.

21:01.136 --> 21:02.429
Give a man the proper motivation,

21:02.513 --> 21:04.932
you never know what he might be
willing to do.

21:05.015 --> 21:06.016
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

21:13.023 --> 21:14.024
You were right.

21:14.525 --> 21:15.526
I was?

21:15.609 --> 21:17.110
No matter how bad things got,

21:17.569 --> 21:20.072
no matter how much danger
we had to pass through,

21:20.155 --> 21:21.240
you stood by me.

21:22.074 --> 21:23.700
Until Cyrus and I were back together,

21:24.368 --> 21:25.369
you stood by me.

21:26.954 --> 21:29.039
We always figured out a way to survive.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.123
We did that together.

21:31.959 --> 21:33.627
The best thieves never work alone.

21:33.710 --> 21:34.837
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

21:35.462 --> 21:36.463
I said all that?

21:38.382 --> 21:41.009
You have the right to fight
for your own love story.

21:42.511 --> 21:43.637
Just, helping Jafar...

21:44.555 --> 21:45.597
It's not the way.

21:47.432 --> 21:48.433
You're right.

21:50.978 --> 21:52.312
I guess I just thought...

21:52.396 --> 21:53.772
You thought you were alone.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.316
But you're not.

22:01.029 --> 22:02.030
(GRUNTS)

22:15.252 --> 22:16.253
(GRUNTS)

22:17.713 --> 22:18.714
KNAVE: Bloody hell!

22:18.964 --> 22:20.966
A bit of warning wouldn't have hurt.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.509
Not nearly as much as the ground.

22:22.593 --> 22:25.137
Good news, the Queen of Hearts
no longer controls you.

22:25.846 --> 22:26.847
Oh, is that so?

22:27.222 --> 22:28.223
(GRUNTS)

22:28.515 --> 22:30.225
Oh! Ow!

22:30.809 --> 22:31.935
I don't understand.

22:32.269 --> 22:33.437
(GROANS)

22:33.520 --> 22:34.938
I have your heart.

22:35.022 --> 22:37.274
Yeah, I don't
bloody understand it, either.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.694
I still kind of feel like I...
Like I have to kill you.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.863
I'll give you a ten-second head-start.

22:42.946 --> 22:44.281
-No.
-20-second head-start.

22:44.364 --> 22:46.074
-I don't want a head-start.
-What do you want?

22:46.158 --> 22:47.784
I want you to stop trying to kill me!

22:47.868 --> 22:49.453
-(WHOOSHES)
-Oh! (GRUNTS)

22:54.833 --> 22:56.502
Yep. I think that did the trick.

22:57.586 --> 22:58.921
You're done coming after me?

22:59.004 --> 23:00.005
I guess I am.

23:00.088 --> 23:02.132
I'll be taking me heart back now.
Thank you very much.

23:02.216 --> 23:03.926
So If I possess your heart,

23:04.009 --> 23:05.344
you'll do whatever I say.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.054
-Wait a minute, Alice...
-Stand on one foot.

23:08.096 --> 23:09.181
-(LAUGHS)
-Very good.

23:09.306 --> 23:11.517
Now, you've had your fun.
Let's sort things out now, eh?

23:11.600 --> 23:13.435
Flap your arms like a chicken.

23:13.519 --> 23:14.561
Fantastic.

23:14.728 --> 23:17.564
Just because I'm not ordered to kill you
anymore doesn't mean I can't.

23:17.648 --> 23:18.649
Hmm.

23:20.776 --> 23:21.777
Stop.

23:25.822 --> 23:27.449
Help me show my father I'm not crazy.

23:27.991 --> 23:31.411
Help me find proof so he can see
that Wonderland is real.

23:32.162 --> 23:33.247
That's what you want?

23:34.498 --> 23:35.499
More than anything.

23:36.667 --> 23:37.751
All right, then.

23:38.001 --> 23:39.670
Let's go and get you your proof.

23:40.921 --> 23:42.923
Thank you for rescuing Alice.

23:43.632 --> 23:45.676
KNAVE: Don't mention it.
Any chance this makes us even?

23:45.759 --> 23:46.760
More than even.

23:47.177 --> 23:49.763
You sure? I just don't want to
have to always be watching me back.

23:49.847 --> 23:51.598
How about I give you a free swing?

23:51.932 --> 23:52.933
No, thank you.

23:53.392 --> 23:55.143
-Seriously, I don't mind.
-I do.

23:55.811 --> 23:57.896
What, because you're a lover,
not a fighter?

23:57.980 --> 23:59.982
I don't want to carry you around
for the next five hours.

24:00.065 --> 24:01.066
Stop.

24:03.610 --> 24:04.736
I don't hear anything.

24:05.195 --> 24:06.196
Exactly.

24:06.989 --> 24:08.323
The Jabberwocky,

24:08.407 --> 24:09.408
she's here.

24:10.367 --> 24:12.786
-Are you sure?
-(WIND WHISTLES)

24:14.204 --> 24:15.205
CYRUS: Pretty sure.

24:16.039 --> 24:18.750
Stop playing games, Jabberwocky.
Show yourself.

24:20.711 --> 24:22.880
JABBERWOCKY: Be careful what you wish for.

24:24.590 --> 24:25.591
You don't scare us.

24:26.216 --> 24:27.885
Mmm. But I know what does.

24:28.302 --> 24:29.386
CYRUS: Take one more step,

24:29.469 --> 24:31.263
and I'll take your head
clean off your shoulders.

24:31.346 --> 24:32.347
Aw...

24:32.890 --> 24:34.308
Come now, Cyrus.

24:34.433 --> 24:36.351
Is that any way to talk to a lady?

24:40.772 --> 24:42.858
You don't know anything about my mother.

24:43.150 --> 24:46.028
Don't let her get in your head.
She's poison.

24:47.029 --> 24:48.530
If Jafar knows we're here,

24:49.156 --> 24:50.407
why would he send you?

24:50.782 --> 24:53.076
He doesn't. And he didn't.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.954
My affinity for Jafar
has lessened of late.

24:56.288 --> 24:57.289
What do you want?

24:57.623 --> 24:59.208
I want what anybody wants...

25:00.626 --> 25:01.627
Freedom.

25:01.710 --> 25:03.128
Forgive us if your freedom

25:03.212 --> 25:05.672
is neither a concern nor a priority.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.091
But best of luck.

25:09.718 --> 25:11.094
Don't be a fool, Alice,

25:11.178 --> 25:13.472
or you'll end up buried in a dungeon,

25:13.847 --> 25:15.390

25:40.999 --> 25:43.001
But remove Jafar from this land,

25:43.460 --> 25:45.003
and fear will leave with him.

25:45.754 --> 25:48.715
With nothing left to eat,
I'll be forced to simply

25:49.550 --> 25:50.759
move on.

25:53.971 --> 25:55.597
Isn't that what everybody wants?

25:57.474 --> 25:59.560
We want more than just to defeat Jafar.

26:01.812 --> 26:03.438
We want to bring back the Queen.

26:06.692 --> 26:08.485
So unless you can help us with that

26:10.904 --> 26:12.281
you're of no use to us.

26:14.783 --> 26:15.784

for holding on to it.

then I wish everybody was
as terrible as you.

27:31.902 --> 27:33.820
Always felt like they were the best kind.

27:33.946 --> 27:35.239

Nothing like that.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.246

27:42.829 --> 27:44.081
We had a lake by our cottage.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.333
In the winter, it'd freeze over,

27:46.416 --> 27:49.378
and we must've spent hours,
days, even, out on that lake.

27:50.170 --> 27:53.507
But all it takes is one second,
one thin patch of ice,

27:53.632 --> 27:55.467
and your whole life changes forever.

27:57.386 --> 27:59.638
I always wondered
what she'd be like when she grew up.

28:00.764 --> 28:01.765

28:03.433 --> 28:05.227
She would have been a bit like <i>you.</i>
