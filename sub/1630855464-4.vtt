01:30.966 --> 01:34.261
<i>If your parents never met,
you wouldn't exist.</i>

01:35.220 --> 01:40.976
<i>In fact, if any of your great-great-
great-great-grandparents hadn't met,</i>

01:41.476 --> 01:42.853
<i>you wouldn't exist.</i>

01:44.938 --> 01:49.860
<i>Everyone in the universe
is the result of a unique set of pairings,</i>

01:49.860 --> 01:52.779
<i>and psychohistory doesn't care about them
at all.</i>

02:00.495 --> 02:01.747
Good morning.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.459
Why the long face?

02:06.043 --> 02:07.419
Could witness prophecy today.

02:07.419 --> 02:10.297
Prophecy. Seldon help us.

02:11.715 --> 02:14.843
Go tend to our guest. I'll pilot us in.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.628
You don't look very comfortable.
Sorry we didn't have a third seat.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.129
Don't worry about me.

02:51.129 --> 02:55.717
I'm perfectly happy rooming

02:55.717 --> 02:58.762
with dehydrated potatoes and...

03:00.889 --> 03:02.516
"ralfbarns." What the hell are ralfbarns?

03:02.516 --> 03:05.727
Food bars. Thespin and delicious.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.312
Did I puke on myself?

03:07.312 --> 03:08.647
You did.

03:12.651 --> 03:13.861
That's the Claric's.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.906
Not really my color, but fuck him.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.044
I heard you once wore a scarlet robe.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.839
Briefly. Till the Clarics took a good look
at my soul.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.591
Well, not everyone is called.

03:35.591 --> 03:38.177
It's possible to do good works
outside the formal system.

03:38.177 --> 03:41.180
Yeah.
It's also possible to cheat the greedy,

03:41.180 --> 03:42.764
bed the willing, and spend the cash.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.850
So your good works are subconscious.

03:48.687 --> 03:49.771
What is that, anyway?

03:51.773 --> 03:52.691
This...

03:54.651 --> 03:56.653
is Locris wine.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.031
It's two centuries old,

03:59.031 --> 04:02.201
laid down ten years
before the Zeonian Rebellion.

04:02.201 --> 04:04.077
Locris had a permanently sunny side,

04:04.077 --> 04:06.330
so the grapes grown there
were extra sweet.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.249
Empire ashed it with his nuclears
a while back,

04:09.249 --> 04:13.462
which means this vintage is rare as hell

04:13.462 --> 04:16.548
and the only luxury item I know of
actually worth its price.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.216
You'd swoon from the taste, Brother.

04:18.216 --> 04:22.387
I don't drink.
But I love the idea of sunny wine.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.681
Why you saving it?

04:24.681 --> 04:26.934
I'm waiting
for something good to celebrate.

04:27.434 --> 04:30.437
I've had this 15 years,
I still haven't cracked it open.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.523
You must be a man of tremendous hope.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.733
I'm sorry, who are you--

04:34.733 --> 04:37.069
For 15 years when something
wonderful happened, you thought,

04:37.069 --> 04:39.905
- "No, something better's coming."
- Maybe nothing wonderful has happened.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.407
You also said
the planet had a permanent sunny side.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.577
Pessimist would've said
it had a permanent dark side.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.081
And speaking of dark sides,
I'd keep that hidden from...

04:50.040 --> 04:52.084
He doesn't always use his best judgment
around alcohol.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.962
- It's because of the alcohol.
- It's a noted side effect.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.047
My Pater runs a pub down there.
The Four Moons.

04:57.589 --> 05:00.259
- I have served a lot of drunks.
- You still do.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.846
What's your real name, Brother?

05:03.846 --> 05:05.639
My Pater is Sayta-Thespin.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.393
We're a cultural minority,
keep our names private.

05:09.393 --> 05:12.354
All right, if I guess it correctly,
you would break a rule

05:12.354 --> 05:14.022
and share this with me right now?

05:14.690 --> 05:17.526
Jormette. Auran. Cavalcade?

05:18.235 --> 05:19.903
- Is Cavalcade even a name?
- No, no.

05:19.903 --> 05:25.075
I panicked. Borma? Ketrin? Agatish.

06:01.987 --> 06:05.115
Director, here's Hober Mallow.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.492
Sef remembers me. We're old friends.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.620
- Mallow.
- Father.

06:10.120 --> 06:10.996
Constant.

06:13.415 --> 06:16.335
I had no idea
you were father and daughter.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.130
Providing a child for the cause.
Who'd have guessed?

06:20.130 --> 06:22.132
- What's happening with the Vault?
- Nothing.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.343
No sign of Seldon.
We're maintaining a perimeter.

06:24.343 --> 06:27.387
This is Brigadier Manlio, and this is
my trusted adviser, Councilor Sutt.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.097
Now, all of you, come with me.

06:31.642 --> 06:34.144
And off we march again to the Prophet.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.313
So exciting.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.500
The Royal Seal is on everything.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.086
This morning,
I thought I saw it on my own face.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.045
And you know what?

07:01.171 --> 07:04.341
It was, because it's embroidered
on the damn pillow.

07:06.677 --> 07:10.472
Plain-faced as a common woman.
Where are your pigments?

07:10.472 --> 07:12.140
It's psychological.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.434
He'll feel like I'm revealing myself,

07:14.434 --> 07:16.061
which will make him want
to open up in turn.

07:16.061 --> 07:20.023
I intend to find out the truth
about my family, one way or another.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.943
I know how to employ courtesan tricks.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.528
You taught me most of them.

07:24.528 --> 07:27.197
Empire makes everyone into a courtesan.

07:28.699 --> 07:29.700
Eventually.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.041
Dusk and Enjoiner Rue?

07:39.585 --> 07:40.586
What? Last night?

07:40.586 --> 07:41.712
Decades ago.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.131
Rue was a concubine in the Gossamer Court.

07:44.923 --> 07:48.385
Your grandfather selected Rue
for a tryst and changed everything.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.804
She returned home rich and celebrated.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.973
I'd have thought he'd have mentioned it.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.185
And he's not my grandfather.

07:56.810 --> 07:57.811
Sorry, right.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.023
It's easy to forget
how things are with you.

08:01.023 --> 08:03.358
It seems so strange from the outside.

08:04.109 --> 08:06.153
Sometimes it's strange
from the inside too.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.032
Should we go this way?

08:10.616 --> 08:13.493
There's a lovely little grove.
It's very secluded.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.040
We'll have your Handman there
as chaperone.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.667
He is a vigilant one.

08:50.113 --> 08:54.243
Seems we've found your seclusion.
Very pretty.

08:57.079 --> 08:58.830
Do you wish to ask your question now?

09:03.585 --> 09:06.004
You want to know
if I was behind the assassination attempt?

09:06.004 --> 09:08.465
Well, you must acknowledge
that the timing is suspicious.

09:08.465 --> 09:09.800
It is indeed.

09:10.592 --> 09:14.221
And do you take me for the sort of fool
who'd make myself look so suspicious?

09:14.972 --> 09:17.307
- I don't wish to believe it was you.
- It wasn't.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.143
There, I've answered it.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.813
It's up to you to decide if I'm lying.

09:25.357 --> 09:30.737
Now, since I've been so open and obliging...

09:35.909 --> 09:37.828
Do you think Day had my family killed?

09:38.412 --> 09:39.246
No.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.209
Is there evidence?

09:45.669 --> 09:46.670
Good reaction.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.548
I'll judge you weren't involved.

09:50.132 --> 09:51.550
I most certainly wasn't.

09:52.050 --> 09:55.179
If it happened, which I very much doubt.

09:55.179 --> 09:58.682
The evidence is circumstantial.

09:59.349 --> 10:02.102
But consider this.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.814
I was a million steps from the throne.

10:07.065 --> 10:10.277
And not a single person
in the line of succession ahead of me

10:10.277 --> 10:11.612
would've made this alliance.

10:13.280 --> 10:17.075
And then one mysterious crash later,
and suddenly there I am.

10:19.119 --> 10:24.666
The weakest member of my family
ruling a weakened Dominion,

10:26.001 --> 10:28.212
just as Day is looking for someone
desperate enough

10:28.212 --> 10:31.673
to climb on top of an Empire
with dangerously adjusted frontiers.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.261
But there are others who've benefited.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.348
Your own Enjoiner Rue, for example,

10:39.348 --> 10:42.392
has risen from concubine
to the right-hand of a future empress.

10:43.018 --> 10:45.103
And I'm sure there are other suspects.

10:45.687 --> 10:48.398
I would still like to know
if my intended is capable of it.

10:52.402 --> 10:53.487
By which, I mean...

10:55.656 --> 10:56.740
I suppose...

10:58.450 --> 11:00.869
Do you feel like you would be?

11:02.454 --> 11:07.334
Since, as we've established,
you are the same man.

11:09.461 --> 11:10.712
I don't think I would be.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.258
But age brings changes.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.262
And I'm well-prepared
to think I could become capable of it.

11:23.058 --> 11:26.520
Of course, that would have to be
before I knew you...

11:29.064 --> 11:30.274
and liked you.

11:33.777 --> 11:35.070
I like you too.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.118
And I like your truthfulness.

11:44.246 --> 11:46.081
Let's stay honest with each other always.

11:54.548 --> 11:58.093
If Day thinks it's to his advantage to
deal with the weakest member of my family,

11:58.677 --> 11:59.678
he's wrong.

12:01.305 --> 12:05.225
You're going to be an interesting addition
to our strange little family.

12:07.102 --> 12:10.898
You know, since you are the same man,

12:12.441 --> 12:14.443
have you ever wondered why
they don't have us marrying?

12:16.278 --> 12:17.404
I think we'd have suited.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.513
I have been admiring your work.

12:43.472 --> 12:47.142
The older sections too.
I saw your hand there.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.728
Well, just touching up
where things have faded.

12:50.354 --> 12:54.274
They didn't use real Dominion pigment
in those days, so thank you for that.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.318
I'm sure it was your idea.

12:56.318 --> 12:57.903
I merely advise.

12:57.903 --> 13:00.405
And you did more than refresh the colors.

13:01.073 --> 13:03.742
The last five generations
have taken up a bolder style,

13:03.742 --> 13:07.162
and your embellishments have brought that
into harmony with the earlier work.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.790
Or at least covered over what was timid.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.167
Well, I started early.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.754
Painted this section when I was still Day.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.258
"Why wait for it to be a chore,"
I thought,

13:19.258 --> 13:22.052
"when it can be a pleasure instead?"

13:29.810 --> 13:32.563
Gossamer Court hasn't changed
as much as the Mural.

13:32.563 --> 13:33.564
Or at all.

13:34.106 --> 13:35.649
It could be 30 years ago.

13:35.649 --> 13:39.152
And you are still just as beautiful.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.654
So it was you I bedded?

13:41.613 --> 13:43.824
I thought maybe I lost count of my Cleons.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.702
No, it was me. Number XVI.

13:46.702 --> 13:47.828
Well, thank you.

13:48.620 --> 13:52.124
The distinction of being selected put me
on the political ladder, as you can see.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.669
Rue.

13:59.673 --> 14:04.052
I've never spoken to someone
after Erasure.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.804
Things are changing.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.725
You might be the last Dusk
and the first Grandfather Cleon.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.477
If the union happens.

14:13.312 --> 14:15.480
Right. Yes.

14:15.480 --> 14:19.151
No one seems to be especially in favor
of this match, apart from Day and myself.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.821
Of course,
we have the votes that matter most.

14:23.614 --> 14:24.907
Not the Queen's?

14:24.907 --> 14:28.535
My opinion weighs heavy with her,
but you're right.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.789
She's her own woman.
She doesn't suffer idiots.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.375
Empire tends to get wisdom late.

14:35.375 --> 14:39.963
For example, I'm much smarter now
than when last we talked.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.423
I wouldn't remember.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.009
And that is a shame.

14:45.177 --> 14:48.972
We had a lively conversation
and a joyous copulation.

14:49.473 --> 14:50.849
Well, that's good to know.

14:50.849 --> 14:54.353
We keep recordings.
We could watch if you like.

14:54.353 --> 14:56.480
In my quarters. It's private.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.984
Would I keep any new memories?

15:01.777 --> 15:03.153
Oh, yes.

15:07.658 --> 15:11.078
<i>We pair to procreate, or so we're taught.</i>

15:11.870 --> 15:13.872
<i>Love itself is inconsequential</i>

15:14.414 --> 15:17.209
<i>when measured against the scale
of the galaxy.</i>

15:28.262 --> 15:29.388
At ease.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.853
Status, Officer Kress?

15:35.853 --> 15:36.937
Yes, General.

15:37.479 --> 15:42.526
Geosynch is at zero inclination, and our
current altitude is 40,000 kilometers.

15:42.526 --> 15:45.445
Type Zero civilization, largely agrarian.

15:46.530 --> 15:49.700
No satellite array. No painting
on any electronic frequency.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.160
It's doubtful
the locals even know we're here.

15:52.160 --> 15:56.123
Good. The Imperium hasn't maintained
an official presence in the Outer Reach

15:56.123 --> 15:57.249
for over a century.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.711
I'm not keen on ringing any alarm bells
just yet.

16:00.711 --> 16:02.462
Shall I arrange a shuttle crew, sir?

16:03.297 --> 16:06.967
No shuttle. Officer Curr
and myself will be winging it.

16:07.551 --> 16:09.678
We'll use the storm as cover.

16:10.262 --> 16:12.347
Engineering will drop
an extraction packet,

16:12.347 --> 16:14.641
then we'll make contact
with our informant.

16:14.641 --> 16:19.646
If these Magicians really are a threat,
he'll know.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.064
Very good, sir.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.669
Releasing extraction packet.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.046
Good for insertion.

16:44.046 --> 16:47.341
Launching in three, two, one.

17:29.508 --> 17:30.509
Glay?

17:42.145 --> 17:43.313
Bel!

17:48.235 --> 17:50.612
Sorry. Missed the landing.

18:01.331 --> 18:05.210
We need to secure the extraction packet.
Make our way to the informant.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.171
Packet is a klick east of us.

18:11.675 --> 18:12.885
Seems to be moving.

18:46.877 --> 18:49.671
Don't underestimate them,
they are armed and reckless.

18:57.429 --> 18:58.639
Well-met.

19:00.933 --> 19:01.934
We mean no harm.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.989
It appears you've recovered our property.

19:15.989 --> 19:20.452
Isn't your property anymore.
This here is salvage.

19:20.452 --> 19:25.082
All right. Siwenna rules.
How much do you want for it?

19:28.836 --> 19:32.047
How much do we want? Let's see!

19:33.131 --> 19:35.759
How about half a dozen of them
pretty little teeth of yours?

19:37.177 --> 19:41.306
No one's got teeth like that
here in Siwenna. Where you from?

19:41.306 --> 19:42.683
Jennisek.

19:42.683 --> 19:43.934
Don't believe it.

19:43.934 --> 19:46.228
Not when you're carrying
imperial property.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.729
We don't want any trouble.

19:48.730 --> 19:51.066
Like he said, we'd be happy to pay.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.818
"We'd be delighted to pay."

19:54.903 --> 19:56.113
Not happening, off-worlder.

19:59.324 --> 20:02.202
Imperial maggots pay in blood.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.291
Bel!

20:14.131 --> 20:15.257
Enough!

20:15.924 --> 20:18.093
Release our property! We release her.

20:19.887 --> 20:21.430
Shut your face!

20:26.059 --> 20:27.477
Fuck!

21:09.645 --> 21:12.314
Shit.
He's gonna be back with reinforcements.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.691
We need to get to the informant fast.

21:25.911 --> 21:27.871
Fuck. That felt good.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.623
Yeah, I can see that on your face.

21:29.623 --> 21:32.042
Come here. Under all the blood.

21:32.543 --> 21:35.295
All right. It was cathartic, I won't lie.

21:35.295 --> 21:36.588
Yeah, but was it necessary?

21:37.214 --> 21:38.715
There might have been a bloodless path.

21:39.508 --> 21:40.509
There wasn't.

21:40.509 --> 21:43.595
Well, we can't know because you dove in
without meeting my eye first,

21:43.595 --> 21:44.972
or giving me a signal.

21:44.972 --> 21:48.308
That is not how we work!
Breaking a nose out of the blue.

21:48.934 --> 21:50.727
Guess I picked up a few new tricks.

21:56.108 --> 21:59.111
- Fuck!
- Empire takes a toll indeed.

22:02.114 --> 22:05.617
Bel, you cannot let them change you into
some hair-triggered nerve-case

22:05.617 --> 22:08.579
- they can just point at anyone!
- Fuck, Glay. I told you, let me be!

22:10.956 --> 22:11.957
Come on.

22:14.251 --> 22:18.297
I'm just saying.
By the time you recognize an atrocity,

22:19.464 --> 22:21.508
you may have already been
complicit in one.

22:22.593 --> 22:23.760
Just shut up and walk.

22:54.583 --> 22:56.376
The fuck is that?

22:56.877 --> 22:57.961
The Vault asked for you.

22:58.837 --> 22:59.880
No.

23:02.299 --> 23:05.302
No. Poly, what the fuck?
It doesn't work like this.

23:05.302 --> 23:08.180
Trust me, it makes no sense to me either.

23:08.180 --> 23:10.891
Apparently,
you're worthy of an engraved invitation.

23:10.891 --> 23:12.601
We don't know it's an invitation.

23:13.310 --> 23:15.270
Not considering what happened to
the Warden.

23:16.146 --> 23:17.481
Huh?

23:21.693 --> 23:22.819
That was a person?

23:28.617 --> 23:30.035
- Hell no.
- We should've told him.

23:30.035 --> 23:32.663
What? About the incineration part?
Yeah, you should have!

23:32.663 --> 23:35.832
- You would've refused to come.
- I did. I did refuse.

23:35.832 --> 23:38.293
Where is that heart full of hope, Hober?

23:39.419 --> 23:41.380
The Vault won't hurt you,
it asked for you.

23:41.380 --> 23:45.008
What if it asked for me
because it wants to kill me? Huh?

23:46.802 --> 23:50.764
No. No, your trumped-up religion, yeah,

23:51.348 --> 23:54.810
can get itself another human sacrifice,
'cause I'm not doing it.

23:56.186 --> 24:00.065
No. No. No, no, no, no!

24:05.988 --> 24:08.866
- So much for doing it your way.
- You're telling me this is my fault?

24:08.866 --> 24:12.035
Of course we're gonna fetch Hober Mallow.
Our future's already been dictated!

24:12.035 --> 24:13.120
Gentlemen?

24:14.162 --> 24:16.123
Come on, both of you. We gotta help Hober!

24:18.584 --> 24:19.668
Guess it's just me then.

24:31.180 --> 24:32.890
Well, are you coming?

24:32.890 --> 24:37.269
Governance depends on me
continuing to govern.

24:49.031 --> 24:50.073
Hober?

24:52.701 --> 24:53.785
Hober?

24:55.120 --> 24:56.121
Weird.

24:57.122 --> 24:58.165
It sounds big in here.

25:06.215 --> 25:07.466
It is big in here.

25:09.051 --> 25:10.677
So, where's Hober?

25:10.677 --> 25:11.970
Hober?

25:15.474 --> 25:16.975
- Hober?
- Constant!

25:19.102 --> 25:22.231
- What the shine happened to you?
- You got water?

25:23.023 --> 25:24.233
Please, please. Give me some.

25:25.234 --> 25:27.528
Two days! Why'd you wait?

25:27.528 --> 25:30.322
Two days? It's been two minutes.

25:35.994 --> 25:37.538
I promise you, it's not.

25:37.538 --> 25:40.999
I've been wandering this place forever.
This place never ends!

25:40.999 --> 25:43.043
Time must be different in here too.

25:43.043 --> 25:45.087
We should step outside
and gather provisions.

25:45.087 --> 25:48.841
Oh, my God. You have a ralfbarn.

25:53.679 --> 25:55.013
Seldon?

25:57.266 --> 25:58.267
Dad?

25:59.560 --> 26:02.813
Director. What about all the governance?

26:05.941 --> 26:07.317
I put Sutt in charge.

26:08.026 --> 26:10.571
And we're very glad you joined us.

26:10.571 --> 26:11.905
Unbelievable.

26:12.823 --> 26:16.076
I turn off the death ray
and it's all aboard.

26:16.076 --> 26:18.245
Have some respect, you arse.

26:18.245 --> 26:23.000
We're inside the mathematics
of Hari Seldon.

26:25.252 --> 26:29.256
Yeah. Well, I wouldn't go that way.
I took a dump over there.

26:32.259 --> 26:36.054
Right. Well, let's go this way.

27:07.669 --> 27:10.589
Wow. I would not wanna get lost in here.

27:11.423 --> 27:13.008
You are lost in here.

27:23.185 --> 27:24.228
You hear music?

27:46.416 --> 27:47.793
It's coming from this way.

28:13.318 --> 28:16.989
Have something to eat. You must be hungry.

28:17.739 --> 28:18.991
The Prophet.

28:22.286 --> 28:23.871
How is there food here?

28:23.871 --> 28:25.622
How is there a library?

28:27.541 --> 28:30.586
The Vault manipulates molecules.

28:31.587 --> 28:35.382
Everything is molecules.
Food is molecules.

28:35.382 --> 28:38.260
If the Vault makes it,
then it all comes from your body.

28:40.846 --> 28:42.848
- Dr. Seldon.
- Director Sermak.

28:43.807 --> 28:48.562
You look like a man who has built himself
a mountain to stand atop.

28:48.562 --> 28:50.439
And such a fine suit as well.

28:50.439 --> 28:51.773
I don't-- I--

28:51.773 --> 28:53.650
We thank you, Prophet.

28:54.151 --> 28:59.323
I'm the director's daughter,
Brother Constant, pledged to your cause.

28:59.323 --> 29:02.910
I see by your robes that the Foundation
has entered the religious phase.

29:04.453 --> 29:07.831
It is a pleasure to meet you,
my loyal child.

29:15.672 --> 29:16.798
Poly Verisof.

29:17.466 --> 29:19.009
Poly Verisof...

29:20.761 --> 29:21.762
The boy?

29:23.096 --> 29:25.265
You were so young just yesterday.

29:26.350 --> 29:28.810
I take it you're also in service to the--

29:28.810 --> 29:31.146
Well, what do you call it?
A church? A--

29:31.146 --> 29:33.398
We do. I am.

29:33.899 --> 29:36.318
Good man. I mean that.

29:36.902 --> 29:39.780
I could almost believe
you transported us to Trantor.

29:40.447 --> 29:44.409
We're inside a tesseract, right?
A polychoron.

29:44.409 --> 29:48.622
A four-dimensional object
in three-dimensional space. Yes, Poly.

29:49.873 --> 29:53.585
And that means that
you must be Hober Mallow.

29:55.337 --> 29:57.923
I heard you, you know,
during your wanderings.

29:59.007 --> 30:05.681
Entreaties to dead grandparents, parents,
and a bewildering number of bedmates.

30:06.974 --> 30:10.143
Yeah, and you didn't think
to throw some food molecules in my path?

30:11.186 --> 30:12.604
You taste delicious, by the way.

30:13.480 --> 30:14.314
Apologies.

30:14.898 --> 30:17.568
I've grown detached from physical needs.

30:17.568 --> 30:19.528
And time, well...

30:21.613 --> 30:23.073
it slips in here.

30:23.699 --> 30:25.450
Besides, I wanted more than just you.

30:27.744 --> 30:29.162
I'm going to need you all.

30:30.289 --> 30:31.540
To do what?

30:31.540 --> 30:33.000
Prevent a war.

30:33.625 --> 30:34.835
Prevent a war?

31:14.291 --> 31:17.461
Stand still, both of you, or die.

31:21.882 --> 31:23.342
Patrician Barr, I take it.

31:23.926 --> 31:25.177
State your business.

31:25.677 --> 31:30.224
I'm General Bel Riose.
This is my Fleet Supremus, Officer Curr.

31:32.226 --> 31:34.895
We've come seeking information
about the Magicians.

31:34.895 --> 31:36.730
I know of no Magicians.

31:36.730 --> 31:39.608
I'm a humble vintner,
as you can clearly see.

31:40.108 --> 31:41.276
Patrician,

31:42.277 --> 31:46.573
the Magicians I'm concerned with hail
from beyond the frontier guards,

31:47.658 --> 31:49.785
where the stars are scattered thinly.

31:50.494 --> 31:53.247
And the cold of space seeps in.

31:55.290 --> 31:57.793
Then call me Ducem, please.

31:59.044 --> 32:03.465
"Patrician" sounds like a rich man
sliding apology money across a mattress.

32:03.465 --> 32:06.802
We have to tell you, we had a run-in
with your countryfolk on our way here.

32:07.719 --> 32:10.430
So we should keep this meeting quick,
for your protection.

32:11.056 --> 32:14.893
Seems Siwenna has fallen into barbarism
since Empire's retreat.

32:17.229 --> 32:19.439
History has been crowded since.

32:20.524 --> 32:24.486
Both Empire's yoke
and the release of it have left a mark.

32:26.363 --> 32:28.365
And yet you're still a loyal subject.

32:29.366 --> 32:32.578
I do my job.
I've been tight-beaming dispatches

32:32.578 --> 32:36.206
ever since the Empire ceded control of
the Outer Reach.

32:36.707 --> 32:40.127
Forty years, no one's ever responded.

32:40.627 --> 32:42.880
Well, we're here now.

32:43.589 --> 32:44.590
Ta-da.

32:46.383 --> 32:47.843
Do you drink needle tea?

32:48.552 --> 32:52.222
I'm told it's socially irresponsible
not to on Siwenna.

32:53.182 --> 32:55.267
Just so. Yes.

33:10.699 --> 33:11.700
Bel.

33:37.518 --> 33:41.104
I see you've found my books.
I collect them.

33:43.357 --> 33:47.861
Since you're men of valor, you may find
that particular one of interest.

33:48.362 --> 33:51.949
Two massive armies gathering
to destroy one another

33:51.949 --> 33:57.079
and a prince and his charioteer debating
the rationale of war.

34:04.962 --> 34:07.214
I've never actually seen a book.

34:08.382 --> 34:11.802
Most haven't. Books are for old men.

34:13.011 --> 34:14.804
Past glories are poor feeding,

34:14.804 --> 34:18.308
and half the stories told
about the old days are mythical anyway.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.020
Drink, drink.

34:23.938 --> 34:25.399
Here's to those who fight.

34:25.399 --> 34:27.734
Here's to those who fight and ask why.

34:30.487 --> 34:32.656
He's right. That's the toast.

34:33.949 --> 34:37.619
An important addition from someone
who clearly asks why.

34:38.745 --> 34:43.792
Now, we've had two visitations
by these so-called Magicians.

34:43.792 --> 34:48.088
The first gentleman was killed by
the local constabulary.

34:48.922 --> 34:50.132
The second, though...

34:53.969 --> 34:56.722
<i>Behold the Spirit's shield!</i>

35:00.809 --> 35:03.979
Wait. Is that a personal aura?

35:03.979 --> 35:07.649
Extrapolated from Imperial design, apparently.

35:08.901 --> 35:12.863
All the representatives of
this Galactic Spirit wear one.

35:17.242 --> 35:22.623
Do any of these representatives mention
the Foundation?

35:26.919 --> 35:30.339
<i>The Vault opened. The Prophet emerged.</i>

35:30.339 --> 35:35.093
<i>He spoke. And those who heard his words
were forever changed.</i>

35:36.803 --> 35:38.388
What do you know of this "Vault"?

35:38.388 --> 35:42.434
The rumor has it it contains
the spirit of the late Dr. Seldon.

35:43.018 --> 35:46.188
Evolutionary AI was banned centuries ago.

35:46.188 --> 35:50.734
Yes. So was jump technology,
absent Imperial use.

35:50.734 --> 35:53.737
What are you saying?
These Magicians are folding space?

35:54.404 --> 35:56.073
Well, judge for yourself.

36:03.330 --> 36:05.624
They call them whisper-ships.

36:06.542 --> 36:09.878
Purportedly,
they navigate without Spacers.

36:09.878 --> 36:11.004
How?

36:11.004 --> 36:13.549
Organic computing, perhaps.

36:13.549 --> 36:19.137
But if you believe the rumors, these ships
literally have a mind of their own.

36:19.137 --> 36:21.849
A ship like this could
jump right on to Trantor's doorstep.

36:21.849 --> 36:22.933
Yeah, if they're real.

36:24.101 --> 36:28.230
Until we witness one ourselves,
these whisper-ships are just that.

36:29.147 --> 36:30.440
Whispers.

36:35.362 --> 36:38.323
<i>Barr! Get your ass out here!</i>

36:39.241 --> 36:41.577
<i>You and your two pretty boys from Trantor!</i>

36:42.411 --> 36:43.871
The local constabulary.

36:45.330 --> 36:46.373
Fuck.

36:51.712 --> 36:53.380
That will take you to the roof.

36:55.007 --> 36:56.216
Here. Take this.

36:56.884 --> 36:59.219
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

36:59.219 --> 37:02.681
And now, I need you to shoot me, please.

37:02.681 --> 37:04.975
- What?
- I've lived a long life.

37:04.975 --> 37:09.980
I have no desire to suffer torture at
the hands of my old f-f-friends out there.

37:10.898 --> 37:12.441
If it's any consolation,

37:12.441 --> 37:17.404
I already poisoned myself
with the lichen I smoked.

37:17.404 --> 37:23.243
But a particle beam to the head
will surely be more dignified.

37:23.994 --> 37:25.162
Please?

37:32.336 --> 37:33.337
Thank you.

38:26.849 --> 38:28.851
I do hope you'll take some wine.

38:29.601 --> 38:33.856
A Cassiopeaen d'Abruzzo.
An excellent vintage.

38:37.150 --> 38:40.362
- And your tea, Brother Constant.
- Thank you.

38:41.738 --> 38:44.575
- Poly?
- Since the Prophet is offering.

38:48.787 --> 38:50.789
Is that what I think it is?

38:55.043 --> 38:56.503
The Prime Radiant?

38:56.503 --> 38:58.672
- Yes.
- But how?

38:59.256 --> 39:02.092
Salvor Hardin left with it
over a century ago.

39:02.092 --> 39:05.345
Surely something so complex
is more than molecules.

39:06.597 --> 39:08.432
Always curious, Poly.

39:11.059 --> 39:16.064
The Prime Radiant is a quantum computer
that exists in a state of superposition.

39:16.773 --> 39:19.735
Meaning it exists in two places at once?

39:19.735 --> 39:21.904
You could think of it that way, yes.

39:21.904 --> 39:23.238
Prophet.

39:23.238 --> 39:25.282
Dr. Seldon, please.

39:25.282 --> 39:26.366
Doctor.

39:27.784 --> 39:31.246
Tell us how we can serve.
Prevent what war with whom?

39:31.246 --> 39:35.542
Empire.
It's the Second Crisis, long anticipated.

39:35.542 --> 39:38.712
Dr. Seldon,
I have been making preparations.

39:38.712 --> 39:40.797
- You'll find we're quite ready--
- Fuck, Sef.

39:41.632 --> 39:46.386
Enough mongering.
If war can be prevented, let's hear how.

39:46.386 --> 39:47.763
Thank you, Poly.

39:49.097 --> 39:53.143
I need them to go to Trantor
and open diplomatic relations.

39:53.143 --> 39:55.354
I take it you know how to sell Foundation.

39:55.354 --> 39:57.105
Seven planets so far.

39:57.105 --> 39:58.565
This is graduation day.

39:58.565 --> 40:00.859
Give them the sermon of your lifetime.

40:00.859 --> 40:05.155
Make them fall in love with us
and delay this war as long as you can.

40:05.155 --> 40:09.743
An agent of peace. Yes.
That's something worth being.

40:10.577 --> 40:13.956
You have by now developed
small jumpships beyond the Empire's ken?

40:13.956 --> 40:15.624
Yes. We have.

40:15.624 --> 40:18.752
Don't use one to journey there.
They don't need to know everything yet.

40:18.752 --> 40:21.338
We'll buy passage
on one of their jumpships.

40:21.338 --> 40:24.132
We're honored to be envoys in your name,
Dr. Seldon.

40:35.644 --> 40:37.896
The honor is mine, my loyal child.

40:41.817 --> 40:45.487
Director Sermak, again, fine suit.

40:46.780 --> 40:51.368
Now, time is crucial,
so speed you on your way.

40:51.368 --> 40:53.245
I need a word apart with you.

40:53.245 --> 40:54.413
With me?

40:54.413 --> 40:56.540
You'll be fine. We'll be just outside.

40:58.458 --> 40:59.459
Come on, Father.

41:12.806 --> 41:14.224
Something on your mind, Poly?

41:14.933 --> 41:17.644
It's just Jaegger.

41:20.355 --> 41:21.356
Jaegger?

41:21.356 --> 41:24.443
The warden you incinerated.
Why did you kill him?

41:24.443 --> 41:25.736
Well, I had to.

41:27.070 --> 41:31.408
For a god to be effective you have
to be intermittently wrathful.

41:32.534 --> 41:36.413
Besides,
I heard the warden on my doorstep.

41:36.413 --> 41:41.001
How long before he declared himself
the only holy vessel worthy of my spirit.

41:41.627 --> 41:43.003
So it was...

41:45.005 --> 41:46.006
divine judgment.

41:48.425 --> 41:51.386
Let no being presume upon my mercy.

42:18.622 --> 42:20.290
Can I ask you something personal?

42:22.835 --> 42:24.211
Am I leaving here alive?

42:24.211 --> 42:25.754
Of course.

42:25.754 --> 42:28.799
For that to be effective,
you'd need witnesses.

42:30.050 --> 42:33.470
No,
you're here because you have influence.

42:33.470 --> 42:34.680
I have influence?

42:35.556 --> 42:38.600
A passing ghost dropped your name.

42:39.101 --> 42:40.102
A ghost?

42:41.103 --> 42:42.187
Tell me your story.

42:43.856 --> 42:46.108
I was born on Smyrno.

42:47.818 --> 42:51.154
Educated almost entirely
at the college of my father's fists,

42:51.154 --> 42:53.448
but I got myself out.

42:53.448 --> 42:57.035
I attended that college too.
I also got myself out.

42:57.870 --> 43:00.205
I assume you did so via dishonest means.

43:02.207 --> 43:05.794
Yeah. Might've sold a few questionable
relics, finger bones, and whatnot.

43:05.794 --> 43:07.546
And you're clearly guilt-stricken.

43:07.546 --> 43:10.424
Oh, come on. The Church of Seldon.

43:10.424 --> 43:12.843
Isn't that part of
the same big confidence game?

43:12.843 --> 43:15.679
You've got priests claiming
they can perform miracles.

43:16.471 --> 43:18.724
Now,
I'm still not sure what that's feeding.

43:19.308 --> 43:20.893
It's feeding growth, Hober.

43:21.476 --> 43:25.272
The developmental stage that
all successful civilizations go through.

43:25.272 --> 43:27.274
Although, some never escape it.

43:27.858 --> 43:32.112
The church will fall away with time
and be replaced...

43:34.281 --> 43:35.574
by another mechanism.

43:36.158 --> 43:38.952
But your skepticism will
serve you well on this mission.

43:39.661 --> 43:41.413
Those I'm asking you to treat with,

43:41.413 --> 43:46.668
they're rightfully wary and not likely
to respond well to the spiritual approach.

43:46.668 --> 43:48.420
So, you're not sending me

43:48.420 --> 43:52.090
with the drunk and the monk
to sell peace to Empire?

43:52.090 --> 43:53.175
No.

43:53.175 --> 43:56.887
Your mission is separate,
and one might say, counterposed.

43:57.429 --> 44:01.266
The person who extends
an open hand in friendship

44:01.266 --> 44:04.394
had better have a blade
in a fist behind his back.

44:06.522 --> 44:07.689
Yeah, I can be a blade.

44:11.610 --> 44:14.279
All right. Where am I being thrust?

44:30.671 --> 44:32.422
I didn't think you were coming.

44:34.842 --> 44:36.093
He's reluctant.

44:37.511 --> 44:40.305
We hear you may be able
to help us with our inquiries.

44:41.932 --> 44:43.642
You may bare your face.

44:43.642 --> 44:47.271
Our Handman has a field disrupter.
Speak freely.

44:47.896 --> 44:50.732
<i>That doesn't matter.
They give us weekly memory audits.</i>

44:50.732 --> 44:53.694
<i>I'm recording us right now
just by being here.</i>

44:53.694 --> 44:54.903
Not to worry.

44:56.029 --> 44:58.615
My own Enjoiner Rue returned
to us from Trantor years ago

44:58.615 --> 45:00.117
with an Empire-tampered memory.

45:00.117 --> 45:03.453
My people developed technology
to block or reverse a memory wipe.

45:03.453 --> 45:04.746
Fool a memory audit.

45:05.873 --> 45:07.374
You truly are safe.

45:19.052 --> 45:21.805
- What's your name?
- Markley.

45:23.098 --> 45:25.392
I don't know if I can help you,
Your Highness.

45:26.768 --> 45:28.812
What do you want?

45:29.897 --> 45:30.939
And what can you pay?

45:31.523 --> 45:35.110
I command the treasury of Dominion.
Your price will be met.

45:37.863 --> 45:41.325
I want to know if Cleon XVII had
a hand in the deaths of my family.

45:44.203 --> 45:47.789
I don't know exactly how to find out,
but I know where to begin.

45:51.126 --> 45:52.169
Good enough for now.

45:54.087 --> 45:55.464
And while you're digging,

45:56.840 --> 45:58.842
I'd like to understand how Day
survived an attack

45:58.842 --> 46:00.427
from the galaxy's best assassins.

46:02.846 --> 46:04.765
Find me the visual records of the attempt.

46:42.302 --> 46:45.305
- It's dark out. How long was I in there?
- We've been waiting for three years.

46:45.305 --> 46:46.974
- Huh?
- Three hours.

46:46.974 --> 46:48.809
You can never just play along, can you?

46:58.569 --> 47:00.571
I guess that's our cue to hightail it.

47:00.571 --> 47:02.698
We'll set out to Trantor immediately.

47:03.240 --> 47:07.703
We'll take <i>the Spirit</i> to the Upsilon
Outpost and get a transporter from there--

47:08.203 --> 47:11.748
I'm not going to Trantor. Yeah,
the doc's got a different job for me.

47:13.834 --> 47:14.918
I thought we'd be together.

47:14.918 --> 47:18.297
Yeah. Sorry.
He told me I should take your ship.

47:18.922 --> 47:21.049
- <i>The Spirit Rising</i>?
- He said you'd balk at the idea,

47:21.049 --> 47:24.344
but he's already put my coordinates into
the ship's guidance system, okay?

47:24.344 --> 47:26.054
It's, you know, it's very hush-hush.

47:26.054 --> 47:28.223
Of course, you can take <i>the Spirit</i>.

47:29.892 --> 47:32.060
Just don't overfeed her.

47:32.060 --> 47:33.645
- Who?
- Beki.

47:41.945 --> 47:44.281
I'll go and collect our belongings.

47:51.205 --> 47:52.206
You'll be fine.

47:53.498 --> 47:54.791
She senses I like you.

47:59.463 --> 48:00.797
You all right, Brother?

48:01.632 --> 48:02.633
Of course.

48:03.926 --> 48:06.136
It's just our parting is unexpected.

48:07.846 --> 48:09.014
I had other hopes.

48:10.891 --> 48:12.768
We were getting to know each other.

48:12.768 --> 48:15.103
You were gonna grow fond of me,
and eventually,

48:15.103 --> 48:17.856
add me to your list of bedpartners
that the Prophet mentioned.

48:21.902 --> 48:22.903
I was?

48:26.281 --> 48:27.908
I'm not generally a robe chaser.

48:27.908 --> 48:30.327
And then you'd be first on my list
of bedpartners.

48:30.327 --> 48:31.411
Brother...

48:33.747 --> 48:35.582
I'm honored, but you're a woman of virtue.

48:36.542 --> 48:38.126
Honestly, I'm not.

48:39.002 --> 48:40.128
Not in that way.

48:41.129 --> 48:44.132
I'm just a woman of small opportunities
and particular likes.

48:46.218 --> 48:47.678
It will happen when it happens.

48:48.345 --> 48:51.932
Yeah. Well, for the record,
I'd prefer to be, say,

48:53.350 --> 48:55.143
tenth on the list.

48:55.143 --> 48:57.187
I just don't like to be first in general.

48:57.187 --> 49:00.274
You saw that. Dragged me kicking
and screaming into that Vault.

49:00.274 --> 49:02.568
I'd like to think that our consummation

49:02.568 --> 49:04.653
would've been
a pretty different experience.

49:07.447 --> 49:08.490
Hey, look.

49:10.367 --> 49:13.370
Maybe the doc will
bring us all back here afterwards.

49:14.037 --> 49:15.831
I can't help feeling that this is it.

49:17.749 --> 49:19.209
And it's a shame. I don't--

49:21.753 --> 49:23.630
I'm not attracted to many people.

49:23.630 --> 49:26.466
Of course not. Why would you be?
I mean, people are terrible.

49:27.301 --> 49:28.468
Maybe you expect too much.

49:29.803 --> 49:32.055
See how you're an optimist
even though you don't think so?

49:33.056 --> 49:35.893
Yeah, that's how I know
I'm gonna figure out your name.

49:36.768 --> 49:37.936
Calliope.

49:38.478 --> 49:41.190
- No, it's Brucilla-- Drucilla.
- No.

49:41.190 --> 49:45.736
You're clear to go, Mallow.
It's been mercifully brief.

49:53.285 --> 49:54.745
Good luck at your coordinates.

49:57.080 --> 50:01.084
Yeah. Good luck making peace with Empire.

50:02.961 --> 50:03.962
Myrna?

50:05.088 --> 50:06.089
Fifi?

50:07.090 --> 50:08.091
Desdarrhea?

50:12.387 --> 50:13.555
- Wenus?
- Yes.

50:13.555 --> 50:14.640
- Wenus.
- No.

50:14.640 --> 50:15.724
No.

50:21.480 --> 50:23.106
You have a generous heart.

51:12.781 --> 51:17.661
<i>With few exceptions, attraction
is entirely irrelevant to human history.</i>

51:18.537 --> 51:21.832
<i>It only matters on the small scale
of the human heart.</i>
