13:17.546 --> 13:19.465
THE BEAM BEGAN IMMEDIATELY

13:19.548 --> 13:21.383
TRAVELING UP MY BODY,

13:21.467 --> 13:24.720
ALMOST AS IF IT...

13:24.803 --> 13:27.306
ALMOST AS IF IT WAS SCANNING.

13:27.389 --> 13:30.309
- WELL, I GUESS NOW WE KNOW WHAT
THE AMULETS ARE FOR.

13:30.392 --> 13:31.727
- OH, AND I LEFT THEM.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.187
HOW STUPID.
I SHOULD HAVE...

13:33.270 --> 13:34.813
- SHH.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.815
- OH, BUT IT WAS ALL I COULD DO
TO FIND THE DOOR.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.567
- DON'T GET EXCITED.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.069
I WILL GET THE AMULET.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.571
YOU STAY HERE AND REST.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.739
- [sighs]

13:43.822 --> 13:44.865
- I'LL BE BACK
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.585
- OH, IT'S SO GOOD
TO MAKE NOISE AGAIN.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.586
- BUT DON'T BE AFRAID
TO NOT.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.755
- HOW DID VICTOR GET IN THERE?

13:59.838 --> 14:01.340
- WELL, LET'S NOT PANIC YET.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.550
HE'S ONLY SEEN THE ANTECHAMBER.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.344
- AND HE CAN'T GET THROUGH
TO THE TUNNELS.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.763
- THESE AMULETS
ARE NOT SAFE IN OUR ROOMS.

14:07.846 --> 14:08.847
- THEN WE'LL HIDE THEM

14:08.931 --> 14:11.392
THE ONE PLACE HE WON'T SEARCH.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.688
ONE SPARE.

14:15.771 --> 14:16.605
- I'M SORRY,
BUT I CAN'T WEAR TWO.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.275
I'D LOOK LIKE A RAPPER.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.985
- WHAT ABOUT THE DOLLHOUSE?

14:27.116 --> 14:28.409
- NOW WHAT?

14:28.492 --> 14:29.618
WE'VE STILL GOT
TO GET ACROSS THE BEAM.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.370
- YEAH, WELL,
WE CAN'T GO BACK TONIGHT.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.122
IT'S TOO RISKY.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.666
- WE'LL GO FIRST THING
BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE GETS UP.

14:35.749 --> 14:36.917
LET'S GO GET SOME SLEEP NOW.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.397
[computer chimes]

14:58.480 --> 15:02.276
- THE COLLECTOR?

15:02.359 --> 15:03.861
"KIDS MAKING FOOLS OF US.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.529
"THEY HAVE FOUND
FROBISHER-SMYTHES'

15:05.613 --> 15:07.615
SECRET STUDY."

15:19.752 --> 15:21.295
[door shuts]

15:23.505 --> 15:26.091
- [sniffs]

15:50.449 --> 15:51.867
[clanking]

15:51.950 --> 15:53.577
- SHH.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.876
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

16:00.959 --> 16:02.544
AND WHAT ARE YOU
DOING CREEPING AROUND?

16:02.628 --> 16:03.712
IT'S 6:00 A.M.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.090
- WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING CREEPING AROUND?

16:11.011 --> 16:13.514
- I WON'T ASK IF YOU DON'T.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.641
- DEAL.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.427
NEVER CHANGE, GERBIL.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.937
- I'LL GO FIRST JUST
TO SHOW YOU ALL

17:02.020 --> 17:04.314
HOW STRAIGHTFORWARD IT IS.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.655
- OH. OH!

17:13.699 --> 17:14.825
[all gasping]

17:14.907 --> 17:16.535
- YOU CAN DO THIS.
COME ON.

17:19.829 --> 17:20.497
[all laughing]

17:20.580 --> 17:23.208
- SEE?

17:23.291 --> 17:24.251
COME ON.

17:24.334 --> 17:25.544
A, B.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.963
C, D, A.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.506
- AH!

17:29.590 --> 17:31.258
- C, A.

17:31.341 --> 17:33.802
C.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.555
A, B.

17:36.638 --> 17:37.514
C, D, A.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.099
[all cheering]

17:41.560 --> 17:42.144
- [gasping]

17:59.620 --> 18:01.288
- COME ON, AMBER.

18:01.371 --> 18:01.789
YOU GOT THIS.

18:01.872 --> 18:02.498
- COME ON.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.459
- YOU GOT THIS.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.168
- EEK!

18:06.251 --> 18:07.586
[all shouting at once]

18:07.669 --> 18:10.255
[screaming]

18:10.339 --> 18:11.173
[all shouting at once]

18:11.256 --> 18:13.091
- GOOD, GOOD.
- [screams]

18:13.175 --> 18:14.676
- LAST ONE.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.844
- YES!

18:15.928 --> 18:17.721
- YOU DID IT.
- YOU DID IT. YOU DID IT.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.057
[all panting]

18:20.140 --> 18:21.016
OKAY, GUYS.

18:21.099 --> 18:24.019
AND NOW THE EXCITING PART.

18:24.102 --> 18:25.312
LET'S SEE WHAT'S DOWN HERE.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.814
- WELL, THIS SHOULD
BE INTERESTING

18:26.897 --> 18:28.148
CONSIDERING WHAT
WE'VE SEEN SO FAR.

18:28.232 --> 18:32.528
- AS LONG AS IT
DOESN'T INVOLVE BUGS.

18:32.611 --> 18:33.737
- A GIANT ROLLING BALL?

18:33.821 --> 18:36.281
- SUBTERRANEAN CAVERNS.

18:41.787 --> 18:45.749
- WELL, IT DOESN'T OPEN.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.669
- NO, THERE'S GOT
TO BE SOMETHING.

18:51.171 --> 18:51.880
- NO ONE GETS DEAD END.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.006
- IT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.050
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

18:55.134 --> 18:55.884
- NONE OF IT MAKES ANY SENSE.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.345
- WE MUST HAVE MISSED SOMETHING.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.973
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE MAP.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.058
- [whispering] ALFIE.

19:03.141 --> 19:04.601
SO HOW DID THE BREAK-UP GO?

19:04.685 --> 19:07.062
- UM...

19:07.145 --> 19:08.105
PRETTY GOOD.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.064
- YEAH?

19:09.147 --> 19:10.065
TOOK IT WELL?

19:10.148 --> 19:11.233
- [chuckles]

19:11.316 --> 19:13.527
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.366
- WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

19:19.449 --> 19:20.200
- PUNISHMENT FOR
THAT LITTLE STUNT

19:20.284 --> 19:22.744
HE PULLED WITH THE CHOCOLATES.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.329
APPARENTLY HE SPEAKS FRENCH?

19:24.413 --> 19:25.581
-<i> MONTEURS.</i>

19:25.664 --> 19:28.417
- YES, I WANTED
SOMETHING MUCH HARSHER,

19:28.500 --> 19:30.752
BUT MR. SWEET INSISTED
IT WOULD BE BETTER

19:30.836 --> 19:32.254
IF WE PUT HIS CREATIVE ENERGIES

19:32.337 --> 19:34.715
TOWARD SOMETHING
MORE CONSTRUCTIVE.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.633
- SO I'M A REPORTER.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.844
- IS THIS ALL WE HAVE?

19:38.927 --> 19:41.430
- YOU DIDN'T RAT ME OUT?

19:41.513 --> 19:42.264
- I DON'T RAT PEOPLE OUT.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.808
- RIGHT,
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.101
WE NEED AN EDITOR.

19:46.184 --> 19:47.603
- ME.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.397
- AH, JOY HAS NOMINATED HERSELF.

19:50.480 --> 19:55.235
ANYBODY ELSE FANCY PUTTING
THEIR HAT IN THE RING?

19:55.319 --> 19:56.945
ANYONE AT ALL?

19:57.029 --> 20:00.198
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE--

20:00.282 --> 20:01.491
- I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.619
I WAS GATHERING ALL
THE INFORMATION I COULD

20:03.702 --> 20:04.870
ON CURRENT AFFAIRS,

20:04.953 --> 20:05.829
AS WELL AS A LITTLE BIT
OF INFORMATION

20:05.913 --> 20:07.998
ON OUR COMPETITORS.

20:08.081 --> 20:11.335
- OH, MARA, WE WERE JUST ASKING

20:11.418 --> 20:13.086
ABOUT NOMINATIONS
FOR THE JOB OF EDITOR.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.671
- OH, YES, PLEASE,

20:14.755 --> 20:15.756
IF IT'S NOT ALREADY TAKEN.

20:15.839 --> 20:17.215
- KIND OF IS.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.718
- NONSENSE.
THIS IS A MERITOCRACY.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.346
- WHERE SUPERMAN LIVES?

20:22.429 --> 20:23.555
- YOU MEAN COMPETE FOR THE JOB?

20:23.639 --> 20:25.807
- YES.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.726
THE MOST IMPRESSIVE
FIRST ARTICLE

20:27.809 --> 20:28.602
GETS THE EDITOR'S JOB.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.395
- OKAY.

20:36.818 --> 20:37.986
- THERE'S NO DEAD END ON HERE.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.780
THE TUNNEL JUST GOES
STRAIGHT THROUGH.

20:39.863 --> 20:42.866
- THERE'S BEEN NOTHING
FROM THE DOLLHOUSE.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.326
- WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING,

20:44.409 --> 20:45.869
SOMETHING OBVIOUS.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.537
- LIKE THE CROCODILE.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.664
- WELL, IT'S LATE.

20:48.747 --> 20:49.957
WE CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT,

20:50.040 --> 20:51.375
SO WE'LL GET SOME SLEEP
AND RECONVENE TOMORROW?

20:53.418 --> 20:55.170
- WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.884
- SWEET DREAMS.

21:08.642 --> 21:11.103
[breathy whooshing]

21:11.186 --> 21:14.731
- YOU SLEEP SOUNDLY, GIRL.

21:14.815 --> 21:19.361
YOUR STONE IMPASSE
DOES NOT TROUBLE YOU?

21:19.444 --> 21:20.779
- I'VE GOT FOUR OTHER PEOPLE
TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

21:20.862 --> 21:22.823
- YES.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.574
YOUR SERVANTS.

21:24.658 --> 21:27.411
LAZY, FEARFUL CREATURES.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.080
PERHAPS IF YOU WERE NOT
THE ONLY ONE FORCED

21:30.163 --> 21:32.165
TO WATCH THE TIMEPIECE,

21:32.249 --> 21:35.335
PERHAPS IF THEY TOO SHARED
THE MARK...

21:35.419 --> 21:36.086
- SHARED?

21:36.169 --> 21:41.675
- I WILL BIND THEM TO YOU.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.260
- NO!

21:43.343 --> 21:45.429
- [screams]

21:47.180 --> 21:48.348
- [panting]

21:49.683 --> 21:52.561
- AMBER.

21:53.186 --> 21:56.398
[echoing laughter]

22:03.155 --> 22:05.365
- WE'RE ALL CURSED,
AREN'T WE?
