01:00.950 --> 01:02.999
If... it's a girl,

01:03.055 --> 01:04.956
I like Mary.

01:05.081 --> 01:07.534
Oh. Your mother's name.

01:07.659 --> 01:09.461
I would like to honour her.

01:09.868 --> 01:11.728
I love the name Mary.

01:12.643 --> 01:15.499
- And if it's a boy?
- Well...

01:15.539 --> 01:17.508
William would be nice.

01:18.521 --> 01:20.372
William the second?

01:20.497 --> 01:24.177
It is a convention to name the
eldest son after his father.

01:25.384 --> 01:28.136
So we'll be calling him... Junior?

01:29.011 --> 01:30.888
Or... Will.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.794
Or... Will... Will... Will.

01:33.830 --> 01:36.669
His name should be something
other than a verb, noun

01:36.697 --> 01:40.066
- and future indicative!
- Cheque please.

01:41.292 --> 01:43.399
- William...
- You don't have to say the name

01:43.422 --> 01:44.797
if you don't like it.

01:45.034 --> 01:47.799
I never said that I
didn't like your name.

01:47.832 --> 01:50.539
I'm afraid I can only offer you this.

01:54.177 --> 01:56.040
"You've saved my life.

01:56.091 --> 01:58.906
Allow me to pay for your meal."

01:59.311 --> 02:01.038
How extraordinary!

02:01.973 --> 02:04.674
- Whoever could it be?
- I have no idea.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.563
Well, it couldn't be for
me. It must be for you.

02:07.592 --> 02:09.020
I've never saved anyone.

02:09.681 --> 02:11.531
Well, except you. Twice.

02:11.576 --> 02:13.354
Well, I've never saved anyone either.

02:13.429 --> 02:16.233
There was the one... I
suppose if you count...

02:16.358 --> 02:18.088
You simply have to tell us.

02:18.213 --> 02:20.839
You're invited to join
him in the private section.

02:38.749 --> 02:40.257
President Roosevelt!

02:41.023 --> 02:43.746
Detective Murdoch and Doctor Ogden.

02:43.871 --> 02:46.590
Imagine my delight at seeing you here!

02:46.785 --> 02:49.065
Oh, these fine men
are my guide and guard,

02:49.088 --> 02:51.897
- Victor Palmer and Wilbur Reynolds.
- Gentlemen.

02:52.876 --> 02:55.426
- What brings you to Canada, Mr. President?
- Yes!

02:55.714 --> 02:57.536
Ahem.

02:58.771 --> 03:00.084
I am here

03:00.124 --> 03:02.824
to hunt the legendary white moose!

03:04.557 --> 03:06.811
I've never heard of such a thing.

03:07.050 --> 03:10.961
Well, I believe albinos
exist in every mammal species.

03:10.973 --> 03:13.604
Oh, it's not an albino!
It has dark eyes.

03:13.662 --> 03:15.717
That's what makes it so rare.

03:16.155 --> 03:18.232
Then... may I ask,

03:18.256 --> 03:20.432
why do you want to kill it?

03:20.772 --> 03:22.494
To preserve it, of course.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.497
You could preserve it with a photograph.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.778
There's already a photograph.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.274
Hmm?

03:29.665 --> 03:31.203
It's the moose I want.

03:32.026 --> 03:34.046
And where do you hope to find it?

03:34.087 --> 03:36.476
Oh, apparently he returns
to Crane Lake every year

03:36.488 --> 03:37.766
at the fall equinox.

03:37.950 --> 03:39.833
Is that common, for an animal

03:39.850 --> 03:42.522
to go to the same spot
at exactly the same time?

03:43.109 --> 03:45.116
Well, perhaps it's legend, but...

03:45.149 --> 03:47.110
I'm willing to take that chance.

03:47.318 --> 03:49.888
Well, then, I wish you happy hunting.

03:50.207 --> 03:52.205
I wish you happy hunting too.

03:52.245 --> 03:54.087
- I just hope you miss.
- Oh!

03:55.400 --> 03:58.624
Oh! Oh. I must ask that we
keep this meeting secret.

03:58.854 --> 04:00.472
The Canadian government

04:00.489 --> 04:02.430
is unaware I'm in your country.

04:02.902 --> 04:04.238
Ah...

04:04.249 --> 04:07.507
- Your secret is safe with us.
- Ha ha ha!

04:10.142 --> 04:13.711
I don't care if he's the king
of bloody England, he's...

04:13.743 --> 04:16.834
he's sneaking into our
country to kill our moose!

04:16.858 --> 04:18.522
You're laying claim to the moose?

04:18.574 --> 04:20.392
- Well, it's a beautiful, rare
- Sir!

04:20.422 --> 04:22.379
- and majestic beast, and...
- Doctor!

04:22.708 --> 04:23.929
George?

04:24.805 --> 04:26.408
I'm sorry to disturb you on a night out,

04:26.426 --> 04:27.785
but we've had a call
at the station house.

04:27.799 --> 04:29.005
Somebody's requesting that you

04:29.019 --> 04:31.534
meet them at the
Queen's Hotel, room 208.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.395
- Who?
- They wouldn't say, sir.

04:33.404 --> 04:36.030
- Only that it was of vital importance.
- Oh.

04:36.062 --> 04:38.830
Terribly sorry. I'll see you at home.

04:39.079 --> 04:42.008
Well, actually, sir, he's
asked for both of you.

04:42.039 --> 04:43.413
Hmm!

05:00.879 --> 05:02.118
Oh, no.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.637
Is this the man that called us?

05:04.762 --> 05:06.244
No.

05:10.002 --> 05:11.911
Terrence Myers.

05:12.452 --> 05:14.707
His name is Guillermo Burgos.

05:14.930 --> 05:17.276
He was an agent for
Spanish Intelligence.

05:17.514 --> 05:19.954
I'd like you to find out
who killed him and why.

05:27.033 --> 05:30.365
We had a meeting but he failed
to show, so I became suspicious.

05:30.543 --> 05:32.048
What was the meeting about?

05:32.274 --> 05:34.038
I'm not at liberty to say.

05:34.650 --> 05:36.635
Did it have anything to
do with the Americans?

05:36.686 --> 05:37.686
No.

05:37.847 --> 05:38.966
Why do you ask?

05:41.509 --> 05:43.093
The door was forced open.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.948
It was locked from the
inside. I had no choice.

05:44.972 --> 05:46.709
All of the windows are also locked,

05:46.741 --> 05:49.577
which means Mr. Burgos
died inside this room alone.

05:50.241 --> 05:51.806
And along with the fact of his death

05:51.829 --> 05:53.846
there's a top-secret
dossier that's missing.

05:53.971 --> 05:56.117
There are no obvious signs of trauma.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.571
I won't know cause of death
until I conduct a post-mortem.

05:58.594 --> 05:59.938
Can you help me flip him?

06:02.808 --> 06:04.723
There's something under the sheet.

06:06.593 --> 06:07.846
Let me see that.

06:08.274 --> 06:11.028
That is the missing
dossier. Intact, thank God.

06:11.084 --> 06:13.179
I'll see you both in the
morgue in the morning.

06:20.742 --> 06:23.450
- An injection mark.
- That's what I thought at first,

06:23.496 --> 06:26.301
but there were no signs of
poison in the blood or the organs.

06:26.370 --> 06:27.641
And it's also not where one

06:27.673 --> 06:29.548
- would readily find a vein.
- No.

06:29.912 --> 06:31.353
So he wasn't poisoned?

06:31.621 --> 06:34.038
Well, there are several poisons
that are fairly undetectable,

06:34.051 --> 06:36.659
but I found something
much more interesting.

06:38.657 --> 06:42.193
Electrical burns to the bottom
of the sigmoid intestine.

06:42.318 --> 06:45.096
Obviously, an electrode
was placed internally.

06:45.685 --> 06:47.132
So this was torture?

06:47.164 --> 06:49.801
Actually, I believe it
was the means of execution.

06:52.738 --> 06:55.504
This is where the
electrodes were attached.

06:55.559 --> 06:58.018
The charge would have
traveled through the heart,

06:58.055 --> 07:00.082
stopping it long enough to cause death.

07:00.648 --> 07:02.080
So he wasn't tortured?

07:03.281 --> 07:06.474
Well, there was a slight
deformation of the ulna,

07:06.487 --> 07:08.186
which could have been quite painful.

07:08.537 --> 07:09.675
How recent?

07:09.698 --> 07:12.101
I'll need your Roentgen ray
device to determine that.

07:12.324 --> 07:14.128
I'll have it sent over straight away.

07:15.445 --> 07:16.799
Electrocuted?

07:17.508 --> 07:19.549
It's also likely he was tortured.

07:19.674 --> 07:22.087
You seem preoccupied
with that possibility.

07:22.096 --> 07:25.036
Is your concern for the victim,
or what he may have revealed?

07:26.047 --> 07:28.106
Do I seem like the sentimental type?

07:28.603 --> 07:31.247
If it was worth torturing
and killing a man for,

07:31.275 --> 07:33.384
then it's at the centre of this case.

07:33.831 --> 07:36.548
- Tell us what it is.
- I can't.

07:36.801 --> 07:39.760
- National...
- Bloody security. Right?

07:40.560 --> 07:42.353
So where does that leave us, Murdoch?

07:42.650 --> 07:44.584
Mr. Burgos was electrocuted.

07:44.602 --> 07:46.533
Now, he did not do that to himself

07:46.541 --> 07:47.863
in a locked room.

07:48.061 --> 07:50.484
Also, the killer somehow escaped

07:50.535 --> 07:52.865
without using the door or the window.

08:06.548 --> 08:09.356
Sir, perhaps the killer was
never actually in this room.

08:09.791 --> 08:12.024
Then how did he kill Mr. Burgos?

08:12.301 --> 08:13.733
Perhaps...

08:14.640 --> 08:16.414
with robotic arms...

08:17.589 --> 08:19.035
built into this wall...

08:19.436 --> 08:22.051
just waiting for the victim
to fall asleep and when he did,

08:22.429 --> 08:23.893
they made use

08:23.907 --> 08:25.265
of this point of entry.

08:25.563 --> 08:27.126
They came in through the vents,

08:27.186 --> 08:28.702
extended across the room,

08:28.720 --> 08:30.866
taking the victim in
their deathlike grip...

08:31.198 --> 08:33.293
and when the deed was
done, they simply retracted

08:33.326 --> 08:35.961
- without a trace.
- And how were these...

08:36.006 --> 08:38.770
"robotic arms" controlled?

08:38.895 --> 08:40.921
By whoever was in the
next room, of course.

08:46.296 --> 08:47.632
"The next room."

08:48.811 --> 08:50.391
Help me with this, George.

08:58.763 --> 08:59.792
Good lord!

09:02.048 --> 09:04.669
Find out who stayed in room 206, please.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.033
Yes, sir.

09:18.109 --> 09:20.307
- Sir.
- What have you, George?

09:20.472 --> 09:22.987
The room was rented by a Juan Gonzalez.

09:23.112 --> 09:24.434
Did you get a description?

09:24.696 --> 09:26.437
Nobody remembers seeing him.

09:27.998 --> 09:31.361
I believe this apparatus
was used to kill Mr. Burgos.

09:33.812 --> 09:35.308
Hmm...

09:36.653 --> 09:37.855
Sir...

09:38.904 --> 09:40.683
there's something under the bed here.

09:46.293 --> 09:47.646
It looks like...

09:48.178 --> 09:50.446
photo processing equipment.

09:52.561 --> 09:54.891
I used the Roentgen rays to determine

09:54.901 --> 09:57.117
whether the ulna fracture was recent,

09:57.242 --> 09:59.659
- and the answer is yes.
- How recent?

09:59.857 --> 10:02.205
Sometime in the last two or three days.

10:02.244 --> 10:05.497
It appears to be the result
of a force applied slowly.

10:05.831 --> 10:07.943
- Painful?
- Very.

10:08.226 --> 10:09.964
So this was torture?

10:10.166 --> 10:12.348
Yes, that's a reasonable conclusion.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.481
I also found this.

10:14.606 --> 10:16.356
I would have dismissed it as a sliver

10:16.385 --> 10:18.238
had it not been for the location.

10:18.722 --> 10:21.094
- It's right above the injection mark.
- Exactly.

10:21.106 --> 10:24.675
- Something was inserted directly into the muscle.
- Post-mortem?

10:24.800 --> 10:29.420
I believe so. I retrieved it and
discovered it was a roll of metal foil.

10:29.453 --> 10:31.553
I've unfurled it. Take a look.

10:38.573 --> 10:40.165
"E N"?

10:41.746 --> 10:43.501
- "E N"?
- Yes.

10:44.542 --> 10:45.845
Let me see that.

10:51.197 --> 10:52.625
No. It can't be.

10:52.708 --> 10:53.827
What can't it be?

10:54.329 --> 10:57.185
I've seen this before. I
know this killer's work.

10:57.697 --> 10:58.968
Who is it?

11:00.672 --> 11:01.947
El Noche.

11:02.354 --> 11:04.010
Spanish for The Night.

11:04.688 --> 11:06.544
He's an assassin who specializes

11:06.557 --> 11:08.174
in killing his victims invisibly.

11:08.653 --> 11:10.695
Well, then, why leave his mark?

11:11.233 --> 11:12.555
Vanity.

11:12.901 --> 11:14.351
He wants his work appreciated,

11:14.379 --> 11:16.378
but only by those
worthy enough to find it.

11:19.049 --> 11:21.131
At least now we know
who we're looking for.

11:21.301 --> 11:22.674
How do we find him?

11:23.065 --> 11:25.884
You can't. He doesn't exist.

11:26.128 --> 11:27.892
He's a character in a novel.

11:28.140 --> 11:29.729
Is someone impersonating him?

11:29.854 --> 11:31.728
I'm the only one that's read the book.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.179
Who's the author?

11:34.985 --> 11:36.427
A former adversary

11:36.468 --> 11:37.615
now imprisoned.

11:37.740 --> 11:40.314
His location is top
secret. You can't go there.

11:40.439 --> 11:42.880
Well then, he'll just have to
be brought to the station house!

11:55.035 --> 11:56.808
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:59.387 --> 12:01.533
Giddy up!

12:08.493 --> 12:10.318
Thank you. You can go.

12:23.624 --> 12:25.431
Allen Clegg.

12:26.336 --> 12:28.206
I thought you were dead.

12:30.930 --> 12:32.611
Hello, gentlemen.

12:39.081 --> 12:42.374
As you may recall, Mr. Clegg
was relinquished to our authority

12:42.380 --> 12:45.311
after he attempted an
attack on his own country.

12:45.541 --> 12:47.809
Which he tried to blame on Canada.

12:48.132 --> 12:49.928
I expected he would hang!

12:49.946 --> 12:52.697
Mr. Clegg is now a guest
of the Canadian government.

12:53.256 --> 12:56.225
Apparently, your prime minister
felt me more valuable alive.

12:56.283 --> 13:00.066
- Alas... I didn't talk.
- No.

13:00.337 --> 13:03.117
But he has chosen to write a book. Hmm?

13:03.242 --> 13:05.996
Entitled... Shadow of the Night.

13:10.913 --> 13:12.341
You intercepted it.

13:12.732 --> 13:14.527
Oh, come, Mr. Clegg!

13:15.329 --> 13:17.362
You didn't actually
believe we would allow you

13:17.367 --> 13:19.215
to publish a book, did you?

13:19.693 --> 13:21.571
Ahem. Who's read it?

13:21.755 --> 13:23.160
Only me.

13:23.753 --> 13:25.377
What's this book about?

13:25.562 --> 13:29.301
A disgraced American
agent reclaims his glory

13:29.333 --> 13:33.354
by foiling the assassination of
the president who abandoned him.

13:33.964 --> 13:36.566
That's it. That's your precis.

13:36.808 --> 13:40.787
- Who's El Noche?
- El Noche is a Spanish assassin

13:40.912 --> 13:43.288
whose brother was
killed on San Juan Hill.

13:43.413 --> 13:46.684
He swore vengeance against
the man who pulled the trigger.

13:46.872 --> 13:48.927
- Theodore Roosevelt.
- If you don't mind.

13:49.664 --> 13:52.198
He tricks Roosevelt
into coming to Canada

13:52.203 --> 13:55.030
to hunt a great white moose.

13:55.559 --> 13:57.944
He knows that Roosevelt
will want this moose,

13:57.984 --> 14:01.123
and that he'll sneak into
Canada with a minimal retinue

14:01.134 --> 14:04.034
rather than suffer a
meeting with Laurier.

14:04.067 --> 14:06.425
Roosevelt apparently finds him boring.

14:06.488 --> 14:07.738
True.

14:08.089 --> 14:10.754
We've uncovered a murder
that was committed by someone

14:10.765 --> 14:13.201
who left the mark of El Noche.

14:13.610 --> 14:15.555
A fictional character?

14:16.171 --> 14:17.968
Oh, he's not entirely fictional.

14:18.026 --> 14:20.485
You based your villain on a real person?

14:20.610 --> 14:23.115
- It's permissible in fiction.
- Who is he?

14:24.295 --> 14:26.236
I first heard of El Noche

14:26.288 --> 14:28.314
during the Spanish-American war.

14:28.597 --> 14:31.774
No one knew who he was,
but anyone who wronged Spain

14:31.803 --> 14:34.192
could expect his shadow to fall on them.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.974
Through systematic
methods of persuasion,

14:37.025 --> 14:39.484
we learned a good deal about him.

14:41.429 --> 14:43.928
Did you leave anything
out or make anything up?

14:43.968 --> 14:46.962
I made up the plot and the
bit about the white moose.

14:46.985 --> 14:49.276
Everything else I got
from stories I was told.

14:49.679 --> 14:51.584
El Noche...

14:51.659 --> 14:54.186
is deadly real, gentlemen,

14:54.311 --> 14:57.055
and he always finds his target.

15:12.081 --> 15:13.779
Giddy up!

15:13.904 --> 15:15.996
It's time for the truth, Myers.

15:16.025 --> 15:18.477
I've told you the truth.

15:19.841 --> 15:22.514
Theodore Roosevelt was
in Toronto last night.

15:25.391 --> 15:28.561
- How do you know that?
- We met him, my wife and I.

15:28.686 --> 15:31.790
He paid for our dinner
just before you sent for us.

15:32.778 --> 15:34.930
You didn't think that worthy of mention?

15:35.260 --> 15:38.454
He's in Canada to hunt
the great white moose...

15:38.506 --> 15:41.079
which apparently
returns to the same place

15:41.102 --> 15:43.220
at the same time every year.

15:43.451 --> 15:45.368
He showed me the Geographic article,

15:45.425 --> 15:48.252
which I assume you got into his hands.

15:49.185 --> 15:51.042
I should never have
brought you into this.

15:51.545 --> 15:53.141
If my superiors were to discover

15:53.164 --> 15:55.022
- that this was out...
- Well, it is bloody out!

15:55.046 --> 15:56.652
And if you don't tell them, we will.

15:57.735 --> 15:59.974
- I'm afraid you can't do that.
- Murdoch,

16:00.290 --> 16:03.122
- get on the phone to the Prime Minister's office.
- Yes, sir.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.902
They know who we are.

16:05.247 --> 16:07.614
Tell them it's a matter
of national security.

16:08.310 --> 16:10.797
Switchboard. Police protocol.

16:11.162 --> 16:13.338
I'd like to call Ottawa, please.

16:13.370 --> 16:15.016
The Prime Minister's office.

16:15.632 --> 16:17.238
Thank you.

16:19.029 --> 16:21.510
The Prime Minister doesn't
know about any of this.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.008
Who does?

16:23.196 --> 16:24.624
Burgos...

16:25.043 --> 16:28.153
but he's dead now. So, just me.

16:28.479 --> 16:30.657
And possibly El Noche.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.909
Ahem.

16:34.158 --> 16:37.267
Gentlemen, when I read Clegg's
book, it struck a chord.

16:38.516 --> 16:40.056
The protagonist is based on Clegg.

16:40.071 --> 16:43.741
The whole book is a roman a
clef of his wishful fantasies...

16:44.845 --> 16:45.917
but it spoke to me.

16:45.951 --> 16:49.576
An agent whose star has fallen
finds a path to redemption.

16:49.897 --> 16:51.522
Your star has fallen?

16:52.910 --> 16:55.588
There were certain incidents
during my time in Borneo

16:55.606 --> 16:57.947
that have somewhat
darkened my reputation.

16:59.063 --> 17:01.492
And how does tricking
the American President

17:01.525 --> 17:03.920
into coming to Canada to hunt a moose

17:03.947 --> 17:05.589
restore that reputation?

17:06.153 --> 17:08.659
Burgos was to fake an
assassination attempt,

17:08.667 --> 17:10.099
which I was to foil.

17:10.464 --> 17:13.265
You copied Clegg's entire plot?!

17:14.185 --> 17:16.654
How was I supposed to know
it was based on real life?

17:17.654 --> 17:18.762
Carry on.

17:18.887 --> 17:21.365
Naturally, Roosevelt
would have been grateful

17:21.397 --> 17:22.641
that we had saved his life.

17:22.645 --> 17:24.340
Likewise, he would have been embarrassed

17:24.346 --> 17:25.843
that he had sneaked into Canada.

17:25.925 --> 17:29.139
This would have given Laurier... an edge

17:29.173 --> 17:31.241
during reciprocity negotiations,

17:31.275 --> 17:33.673
and I would be restored
to agent, first class.

17:33.724 --> 17:34.843
And Burgos?

17:34.889 --> 17:38.357
Burgos, already compromised,
feared retribution from Spain.

17:38.781 --> 17:40.854
After his capture, I
was to fake his death

17:40.868 --> 17:42.673
and give him a new identity.

17:43.359 --> 17:45.501
Unfortunately, he was tracked down

17:45.524 --> 17:47.925
and killed by El Noche himself.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.839
A bit of irony there.

17:50.231 --> 17:51.604
So, how do we catch him?

17:51.788 --> 17:55.408
Well, sir, the first step is to
learn all we can about El Noche,

17:55.491 --> 17:58.669
- starting with Mr. Clegg's book.
- No.

17:58.973 --> 18:00.921
I'm afraid that's
classified as top secret.

18:00.944 --> 18:02.293
Not anymore, it isn't.

18:06.678 --> 18:08.750
I'm finished. Who has chapter six?

18:08.813 --> 18:10.823
- I do.
- Well, here. Let's swap.

18:10.859 --> 18:12.126
We aren't supposed to swap.

18:12.154 --> 18:14.083
Damn it, Higgins! Chapter
five ends with El Noche

18:14.093 --> 18:15.640
drawing a bead on Roosevelt's forehead!

18:15.649 --> 18:17.035
I have to know what happens next!

18:17.330 --> 18:19.582
Roosevelt trips and the
shot goes over his head.

18:20.697 --> 18:22.272
That's a bit anti-climactic.

18:22.314 --> 18:24.364
What a crackerjack of a novel, eh lads?

18:24.631 --> 18:26.451
- Who's got chapter five?
- Sir!

18:26.478 --> 18:29.362
Gentlemen, gentlemen. We are
only reading one chapter each

18:29.394 --> 18:31.251
and noting everything about El Noche.

18:31.283 --> 18:33.761
Oh! You are the death of joy, Murdoch.

18:34.004 --> 18:35.075
Thank you, sir.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.000
What have we learned so far?

18:37.069 --> 18:38.750
He's not afraid of heights.

18:39.067 --> 18:41.347
He travels in the
treetops above his quarry.

18:41.375 --> 18:43.236
And he has a terrible fear of water,

18:43.277 --> 18:44.746
won't even get into a boat.

18:44.916 --> 18:47.404
He hides photos in his bedposts.

18:48.243 --> 18:49.504
I'm sorry, what?

18:50.002 --> 18:52.526
El Noche knows that they're
on the way to his room.

18:52.862 --> 18:54.462
They still don't know
what he looks like.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.399
But if they find the photos in his room,

18:56.422 --> 18:57.896
then they'll know all his plans,

18:57.915 --> 19:00.116
so he hides the photos in his bedpost.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.857
Bloody brilliant!

19:11.839 --> 19:13.101
Anything?

19:13.307 --> 19:14.321
Nothing.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.016
Hid it in the bedpost.

19:20.038 --> 19:21.415
Oh, well.

19:21.540 --> 19:23.902
Perhaps Mr. Clegg invented it

19:24.027 --> 19:26.789
- as a plot device.
- Mm-hmm.

19:27.090 --> 19:28.977
Wrote himself into a corner...

19:39.644 --> 19:41.192
Would you look at that?

19:43.296 --> 19:44.821
It's what I feared, gentlemen.

19:44.848 --> 19:46.119
How do you mean?

19:46.244 --> 19:48.104
That is a photograph

19:48.155 --> 19:51.209
of a document from the dossier
that Burgos was carrying.

19:51.444 --> 19:52.936
What does that mean?

19:52.973 --> 19:55.719
It means that El Noche has
all the information he needs

19:55.742 --> 19:57.870
to assassinate President
Roosevelt himself.

20:08.794 --> 20:11.267
Sirs. The station agent at Brignall

20:11.299 --> 20:14.044
said that the only people who
disembarked at the northbound 10:14

20:14.067 --> 20:15.573
were a woman and two children.

20:15.656 --> 20:16.825
What about southbound?

20:16.890 --> 20:20.256
He said a lone man did get off
the Southbound train at 11:48.

20:20.776 --> 20:22.446
But that can't be El Noche.

20:22.716 --> 20:24.079
He would be traveling northbound.

20:24.093 --> 20:26.451
But sir, if he carried on
northbound to Parry Sound,

20:26.465 --> 20:28.745
then took the southbound
to avoid detection...

20:28.870 --> 20:29.870
It's what I would do.

20:30.260 --> 20:31.752
So he's got a head start.

20:32.075 --> 20:34.281
Henry, when is the next
train out of Toronto?

20:34.484 --> 20:37.436
There's a 12:42 out
of Union Station, sir.

20:37.561 --> 20:39.454
That's enough time to pack and change.

20:39.523 --> 20:40.987
We'll make Crane Lake by nightfall.

20:41.204 --> 20:43.917
But we know he prefers to attack
under the cover of darkness.

20:44.442 --> 20:47.302
We also know the assassin
is terrified of water.

20:47.629 --> 20:49.480
We'll be safe on this island.

20:49.669 --> 20:51.509
Well! Get to it then, gentlemen.

20:51.644 --> 20:53.565
Where is my bolograph?

20:53.602 --> 20:55.154
Your what?

20:55.518 --> 20:58.446
It converts heat radiation
into a graphic array.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.123
You can see people in the dark.

21:00.248 --> 21:02.311
Well, actually sir, you can see the heat

21:02.357 --> 21:05.599
radiating off of their bodies. George!

21:06.046 --> 21:07.833
Sir, I found it!

21:08.454 --> 21:09.772
Where was it?

21:09.814 --> 21:12.886
Sir, McNabb had taken it
to help him shoot raccoons.

21:12.905 --> 21:15.272
Bloody McNabb. Big dozy git.

21:15.954 --> 21:17.340
Thank you.

21:20.314 --> 21:21.805
Well, get a move on, then.

21:22.013 --> 21:24.228
You've got 10 minutes
to catch that train.

21:25.449 --> 21:26.945
- Yeah!
- Good luck.

21:41.461 --> 21:43.731
You know, it occurs to me, Murdoch, that

21:44.454 --> 21:47.567
should we reach Roosevelt
before El Noche attacks,

21:47.847 --> 21:51.291
I will, in fact, be saving the
American President from assassination.

21:51.320 --> 21:54.084
- Ha!
- And if Roosevelt dies?

21:55.408 --> 21:57.561
The Americans will want to know

21:57.855 --> 21:59.410
why he was in Canada.

21:59.433 --> 22:01.793
They'll probably
uncover the role I played

22:01.810 --> 22:03.751
and my life will be over.

22:03.876 --> 22:06.065
Then I'd suggest we pick up the pace.

22:10.325 --> 22:11.586
Sir!

22:12.098 --> 22:15.258
A body has been found in an
alleyway off Darcy Street.

22:15.823 --> 22:17.216
Well, let's get a move on.

22:17.233 --> 22:19.547
- And let's inform Dr. Ogden.
- Sir.

22:21.579 --> 22:24.388
All right. Let's see what
we've got then, Crabtree.

22:27.866 --> 22:30.081
- Oh!
- Oh, good God!

22:30.206 --> 22:31.982
Oh! It appears he's lost his head.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.847
And hands by the look of it, sir.

22:33.972 --> 22:36.462
The killer obviously didn't
want us to identify him.

22:36.531 --> 22:38.229
What have we, gentlemen?

22:38.258 --> 22:42.286
- A particularly grisly one I'm afraid, Doctor.
- That it is.

22:46.954 --> 22:48.624
Excuse me.

22:48.831 --> 22:51.254
Well, I've never seen her
react like that before.

22:51.300 --> 22:54.239
Sir, that's the second time I've
seen Dr. Ogden overcome like that.

22:54.308 --> 22:56.744
Women have peculiar
constitutions, Crabtree.

22:56.807 --> 22:58.351
When Margaret was expecting Bobby,

22:58.365 --> 23:00.205
the sight of blood would
send her into a fit.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.649
Sir, are you suggesting
Dr. Ogden is with child?

23:02.677 --> 23:05.509
Bloody hell, Crabtree! I'm
saying women are unpredictable.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.644
Don't look for a reason
for their behavior.

23:07.677 --> 23:09.069
You won't find it.

23:10.663 --> 23:13.568
- Everything all right, Doctor?
- Let's just get it over with.

23:20.448 --> 23:21.720
Judging by the...

23:22.376 --> 23:24.208
the body temperature...

23:24.904 --> 23:28.451
and state of rigor
mortis, I'd suggest...

23:29.303 --> 23:31.802
the time of death was
shortly after midnight.

23:31.836 --> 23:33.833
As for the cause of death...

23:35.306 --> 23:36.844
I'll have to let you know.

23:37.258 --> 23:38.893
Ah!

23:40.057 --> 23:44.168
- Sir, something rather gross has been found.
- Oh, no.

24:11.297 --> 24:15.045
Three bedrolls. The President
is traveling with two other men.

24:24.901 --> 24:26.393
Mr. President.

24:30.925 --> 24:33.035
My dog chased a rabbit
through the fence.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.799
He didn't catch the
rabbit, but he found this.

24:36.015 --> 24:37.489
He wanted to keep digging.

24:37.834 --> 24:39.921
- Whoa, boy.
- Oh, gracious.

24:40.745 --> 24:42.440
Oh, bloody hell.

24:43.951 --> 24:45.084
Sir...

24:45.687 --> 24:47.479
are you thinking what I'm thinking?

24:47.604 --> 24:50.114
That this belongs to the
body we found earlier?

24:50.694 --> 24:52.541
Get your dog to sniff around some more.

24:52.564 --> 24:54.415
I'll give you a dollar for
every body part you find.

24:54.439 --> 24:56.272
- How about two?
- Don't push it.

24:56.308 --> 24:59.040
- Come on.
- Sir, look. There's a scar on the middle finger.

24:59.054 --> 25:00.391
So?

25:00.423 --> 25:03.674
The fingermark I lifted from
the photograph in the bedpost

25:03.729 --> 25:05.387
had a similar scar.

25:10.347 --> 25:13.418
How would a Spanish
assassin know I'm here?

25:13.450 --> 25:15.403
Even my cabinet is in the dark about it.

25:15.486 --> 25:17.209
- Well, sir...
- We don't know.

25:17.730 --> 25:19.903
But as you well know, sir, Spanish spies

25:19.913 --> 25:21.129
are among the world's best.

25:21.254 --> 25:23.589
I'm convinced as to the
threat, Mr. President.

25:23.621 --> 25:26.172
Damn it, Reynolds! I'm not
leaving without that moose.

25:26.255 --> 25:28.858
It returns every year, sir.
We can always come back.

25:31.663 --> 25:33.874
You say he only attacks at night.

25:34.284 --> 25:36.305
- Well, according to...
- That's correct.

25:36.430 --> 25:39.114
Then we won't have time to get
to Brignall Station before dark.

25:39.239 --> 25:42.251
No, but we can get to the
island before the sun sets.

25:42.449 --> 25:44.977
But what good is the island?
We'll be sitting ducks.

25:45.037 --> 25:46.976
The assassin is afraid of open water.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.192
Won't even get into a boat.

25:48.317 --> 25:50.970
How do you know so much about him? Hmm?

25:51.021 --> 25:54.755
- Interestingly, we learned about him from...
- Spanish intelligence.

25:55.031 --> 25:57.683
The assassin is
apparently a rogue agent.

25:58.081 --> 26:00.479
Personal vendetta against
yourself apparently, sir.

26:00.958 --> 26:02.469
What did I do to him?

26:02.502 --> 26:05.251
His brother was killed in
your charge up San Juan Hill.

26:06.278 --> 26:08.254
Well, if that's the case,

26:08.291 --> 26:10.801
we ought to pack and move
on as quickly as we can.

26:10.833 --> 26:12.164
Go.

26:16.881 --> 26:19.377
Murdoch, you cannot
tell them about Clegg.

26:19.435 --> 26:22.012
Mr. Meyers, I will not lie

26:22.026 --> 26:24.946
to the American President
in order to spare you

26:24.978 --> 26:27.051
the consequences of your poor decisions.

26:27.079 --> 26:29.989
Listen carefully. Clegg being
alive was not my decision.

26:30.017 --> 26:31.762
It was Laurier's.

26:31.956 --> 26:34.305
Two years ago, we informed
the American government

26:34.319 --> 26:36.925
that we had hanged Clegg. We did not.

26:36.990 --> 26:39.086
We only kept him alive
in order to extract

26:39.113 --> 26:41.853
American intelligence secrets.

26:42.028 --> 26:43.461
So you see, Murdoch...

26:43.958 --> 26:47.307
my own personal interests are
not the only ones at stake here.

26:59.555 --> 27:00.564
It's a match, sir.

27:01.033 --> 27:03.225
You're saying these belong
to the infamous El Noche.

27:03.253 --> 27:06.307
Well, most of him. There's
still a head and a hand at large.

27:06.432 --> 27:08.628
He was an assassin
who killed an assassin.

27:08.633 --> 27:11.236
- And has now been assassinated.
- Concisely put, Sir.

27:11.262 --> 27:13.665
- Thank you, Crabtree.
- We found the head.

27:14.567 --> 27:15.805
Let's have a look.

27:21.198 --> 27:22.307
Crikey!

27:22.348 --> 27:23.331
Sir that's...

27:23.332 --> 27:25.817
The prison guard that
escorted Clegg to our station.

27:26.181 --> 27:28.662
So Clegg's escort was El Noche?

27:29.270 --> 27:30.530
He's been dead how long?

27:30.655 --> 27:32.139
Midnight last night.

27:32.637 --> 27:34.825
Clegg and the guard left the station

27:35.308 --> 27:36.815
after 11 o'clock.

27:37.158 --> 27:40.351
Sir, I'll get Clegg's picture
to all points of transit.

27:41.689 --> 27:42.990
Carry on, Higgins.

27:43.303 --> 27:44.390
Sir.

27:46.668 --> 27:49.199
The device uses a bolometer
and a graphic array

27:49.206 --> 27:50.875
to visualize heat radiation.

27:51.125 --> 27:53.469
This would be excellent
for hunting at night.

27:53.598 --> 27:55.809
It's only accurate up to 100 yards,

27:55.827 --> 27:58.635
but should help us see
anyone approaching the island.

27:58.930 --> 28:00.606
There's someone coming right now.

28:00.964 --> 28:03.654
Sir, you must remain in the tent.

28:03.724 --> 28:06.019
Canvas won't stop a bullet, Meyers.

28:06.056 --> 28:09.589
No, but it will obscure you from
a sniper on the mainland. Please.

28:14.648 --> 28:15.779
Sir.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.935
We found the Canadian
government wagon abandoned

28:17.938 --> 28:19.409
outside Union Station.

28:19.840 --> 28:21.624
So he's making good his escape.

28:22.209 --> 28:24.016
If freedom is what he's seeking.

28:24.229 --> 28:25.204
How do you mean?

28:25.206 --> 28:28.035
Well, we showed Clegg's photo
around Union Station this morning.

28:28.083 --> 28:31.620
A clerk remembers selling him a
train ticket to Brignall this morning.

28:31.745 --> 28:32.745
Brignall?

28:33.002 --> 28:35.155
That's the nearest station
to where Roosevelt is camped.

28:35.179 --> 28:37.334
Sir, it can't be a coincidence.

28:37.875 --> 28:39.519
What does this have to do with El Noche?

28:39.541 --> 28:41.701
Sir, what if Clegg's guard

28:42.000 --> 28:45.023
was playing the role of El Noche
while Clegg was still imprisoned?

28:45.465 --> 28:46.465
To what end, though?

28:46.504 --> 28:49.764
Because Clegg's been trying
to obscure the true identity

28:49.787 --> 28:51.326
of the assassin all along.

28:53.477 --> 28:54.524
Bloody hell!

28:55.920 --> 28:57.257
Allen Clegg...

28:57.857 --> 28:59.464
... is El Noche.

29:06.345 --> 29:08.346
There'll be a station agent at Brignall.

29:09.259 --> 29:10.988
Get me Brignall station right away.

29:12.071 --> 29:13.924
Yes, sir. This is Toronto Constabulary.

29:13.946 --> 29:16.864
We need to get an urgent message
to a hunting party at Crane Lake.

29:17.774 --> 29:20.757
- Yes, I realize it's nighttime.
- Oh! Give me that, Crabtree.

29:21.166 --> 29:22.651
Now listen to me!

29:23.014 --> 29:25.775
The American President
is staying at Crane Lake.

29:26.388 --> 29:28.847
He will be killed if he doesn't
get this message immediately.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.201
The message as follows:

29:30.326 --> 29:32.435
Allen Clegg is El Noche.

29:32.486 --> 29:34.271
And he's escaped. Repeat:

29:34.319 --> 29:37.226
Allen Clegg is El
Noche. And he's escaped.

29:54.651 --> 29:57.009
I must insist you keep
down, Mr. President.

29:57.024 --> 29:58.752
He can still shoot at
us from the mainland.

29:58.785 --> 30:00.122
Well, let him try!

30:00.177 --> 30:02.557
His muzzleflash will
reveal his position.

30:06.275 --> 30:07.859
Perhaps you should remove your hat...

30:09.112 --> 30:10.201
Mr. President.

30:23.682 --> 30:25.837
The Parry Sound Constabulary
has sent a group of men,

30:25.844 --> 30:28.004
but most likely they likely
won't get there until dawn.

30:28.446 --> 30:30.272
What about the station agent?

30:30.313 --> 30:31.997
He's on his way by canoe

30:32.052 --> 30:34.366
- Apparently, it's quicker.
- Oh!

30:34.712 --> 30:36.171
It'll be all right, Doctor.

30:36.443 --> 30:37.873
As soon as he gets the message,

30:37.906 --> 30:39.712
Detective Murdoch will know what to do.

30:45.301 --> 30:47.216
The first I went hunting was in Maine.

30:47.643 --> 30:49.250
I was taught by the best.

30:49.301 --> 30:51.287
Bill Sewall, Wilmot Dow.

30:51.891 --> 30:53.173
What were you hunting?

30:54.061 --> 30:55.439
Waterfowl, mostly.

30:56.460 --> 30:58.199
I was rather nervous at first.

30:58.648 --> 31:00.023
The anticipation.

31:01.563 --> 31:03.545
The exhilaration of lying in wait,

31:03.670 --> 31:04.802
finger on the trigger.

31:08.091 --> 31:10.799
And now I lie in wait
for someone to shoot me.

31:11.254 --> 31:12.601
Hmm.

31:13.839 --> 31:15.372
Pardon me, Mr. President.

31:15.399 --> 31:17.582
Detective Murdoch's device
has picked up a signal.

31:34.812 --> 31:36.452
There's somebody near our boat.

31:48.406 --> 31:49.406
Here!

31:52.338 --> 31:53.373
Who's that?

31:54.357 --> 31:55.480
I don't know.

31:56.799 --> 31:59.889
It's the railway agent
from Brignall Station.

32:00.234 --> 32:02.913
- What's he doing out here?
- There's something in his mouth.

32:07.776 --> 32:10.362
It's part of a telegram from
Station House Number Four.

32:11.804 --> 32:13.218
El Noche.

32:21.466 --> 32:23.152
El Noche?

32:24.428 --> 32:26.118
It's the name of the assassin.

32:26.418 --> 32:27.961
Where's the rest of that message?

32:28.011 --> 32:31.207
- More importantly, what was the message?
- No, no, no. Hold on.

32:31.275 --> 32:33.764
El Noche is Spanish for The Night.

32:34.588 --> 32:35.942
He calls himself The Night?

32:36.067 --> 32:37.067
You've heard of him?

32:37.107 --> 32:39.270
Oh, yes. We know a man who
called himself The Night...

32:39.294 --> 32:40.800
but he wasn't Spanish.

32:41.077 --> 32:42.173
Who was he?

32:42.560 --> 32:44.692
An American agent you know, Mr. Meyers.

32:45.337 --> 32:47.324
Your government hanged
him two years ago.

32:48.238 --> 32:50.193
Are you speaking of Allen Clegg?

32:50.227 --> 32:51.393
Murdoch...

32:51.518 --> 32:55.128
- Allen Clegg called himself The Night?
- Murdoch, a word...

32:55.152 --> 32:57.159
Enough lies, Mr. Meyers.

32:58.076 --> 33:00.103
Allen Clegg is alive, Mr. President.

33:00.278 --> 33:02.138
And I fear he may be the man

33:02.172 --> 33:03.681
who seeks to kill you.

33:03.921 --> 33:05.063
What?

33:05.519 --> 33:06.643
Think of it!

33:06.845 --> 33:09.754
We were sent a message
of enough importance

33:09.798 --> 33:11.856
that the Station Agent canoed for miles

33:11.871 --> 33:13.800
through the night to
try to get it to us.

33:14.389 --> 33:16.315
You think that message
was meant to warn us

33:16.333 --> 33:18.622
that Clegg himself is the assassin?

33:18.686 --> 33:20.685
Why has your government lied to me?!

33:22.757 --> 33:25.023
I'm not at liberty to discuss that, Sir.

33:25.051 --> 33:26.363
More importantly,

33:26.994 --> 33:29.228
why would Clegg want to kill you?

33:29.997 --> 33:32.318
Well, we... we have a history.

33:32.806 --> 33:34.201
We met at Harvard.

33:34.326 --> 33:37.011
We were both writing our
theses on the war of 1812.

33:37.444 --> 33:40.041
Clegg was obsessed that America

33:40.078 --> 33:42.598
had lost its opportunity
to claim Canada as its own.

33:42.723 --> 33:44.122
And he still is.

33:44.168 --> 33:45.822
You think it's possible that Clegg

33:45.831 --> 33:48.203
seeks to start another war with Canada?

33:48.417 --> 33:51.020
But how would killing me result in war?

33:51.092 --> 33:53.505
It's not like I was
coerced into coming here.

33:54.154 --> 33:55.380
Not coerced...

33:55.725 --> 33:56.936
Tricked.

33:58.788 --> 34:01.008
Isn't that right, Mr. Meyers?

34:07.088 --> 34:09.119
What can you tell us about Allen Clegg?

34:09.994 --> 34:11.855
When I was Secretary of the Navy,

34:11.924 --> 34:14.033
Clegg was a covert operative.

34:14.377 --> 34:16.617
It is believed he planted a bomb

34:16.626 --> 34:18.348
on the hull of the USS Maine.

34:19.324 --> 34:20.683
In Havana Harbor?

34:21.609 --> 34:22.618
Yes.

34:22.636 --> 34:24.514
The explosion split the ship in two.

34:24.821 --> 34:27.090
And the war was declared against Spain.

34:30.654 --> 34:32.735
If Clegg was a navy diver...

34:32.757 --> 34:34.264
He's not afraid of water.

34:34.518 --> 34:36.714
He only told us that to
get us on this island.

34:36.839 --> 34:39.583
Which means our sanctuary is a trap.

34:41.243 --> 34:42.408
Reynolds!

34:43.670 --> 34:45.079
Why won't he answer?

34:45.699 --> 34:46.929
Get down!

34:50.208 --> 34:51.466
Got your answer.

34:51.746 --> 34:53.083
Dear God.

34:55.625 --> 34:57.025
He scuttled the boat.

34:57.951 --> 34:59.665
We'll have to swim for it.

35:00.903 --> 35:03.769
Sir. Agent Clegg now has the bolograph,

35:03.809 --> 35:05.991
which means he can see us.

35:06.394 --> 35:09.042
- Palmer!
- Get down, sir!

35:14.218 --> 35:15.790
He's given away his position.

35:25.525 --> 35:26.861
You might've gotten him.

35:27.770 --> 35:28.967
I doubt it.

35:29.944 --> 35:31.923
Sir, we've got to get
you to the mainland.

35:31.946 --> 35:33.872
I'm not leaving this
island without Palmer.

35:33.908 --> 35:36.957
You don't have to. All we have
to do is get into the water.

35:37.013 --> 35:39.437
- The water is freezing.
- Precisely my point.

35:39.562 --> 35:41.305
If we lower our body temperatures,

35:41.347 --> 35:43.408
he won't be able to see
us with the bolograph.

35:43.461 --> 35:44.571
And then?

35:44.865 --> 35:45.943
We fight back.

35:47.081 --> 35:48.223
All right.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.052
Let's move.

35:54.602 --> 35:57.014
Cover him with blankets.
Try to make him comfortable.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.461
What can I do?

35:59.285 --> 36:02.026
Fill this bag with warm
rocks from the fire.

36:02.151 --> 36:03.670
For what reason?

36:03.748 --> 36:06.977
You've hunted waterfowl
before. We're making a decoy.

36:34.359 --> 36:35.727
Right. After him!

36:44.529 --> 36:46.634
- Blood.
- Let's track him.

37:09.484 --> 37:10.732
There's more blood.

37:13.665 --> 37:15.277
- We're close.
- Sir,

37:15.535 --> 37:17.396
be careful. It could be a trap.

37:18.104 --> 37:20.291
You've been saying that
since dawn broke, Murdoch.

37:20.314 --> 37:22.801
Let's just say I have my own
reasons for being careful.

37:22.926 --> 37:24.238
And that is?

37:24.920 --> 37:26.329
Can you keep a secret?

37:26.951 --> 37:28.688
Murdoch, I'm a spy.

37:29.724 --> 37:31.464
Julia is with child.

37:32.827 --> 37:34.665
That's wonderful, Murdoch. And yes,

37:34.748 --> 37:36.678
your secret is safe with...

37:36.803 --> 37:39.355
- Meyers, no!
- Get him!

37:41.192 --> 37:43.311
Murdoch, this way!

37:49.765 --> 37:51.526
Sir, wait!

38:08.827 --> 38:10.733
I've lost sight of him.

38:10.858 --> 38:12.327
So have I.

38:21.084 --> 38:22.437
Ahem.

38:31.459 --> 38:34.805
If I put my gun down, you'll
shoot the President and flee.

38:35.381 --> 38:37.172
I can't let you do that.

38:37.748 --> 38:40.384
You shoot him, and I will shoot you.

38:40.931 --> 38:42.589
I'm surprised at you Clegg.

38:42.714 --> 38:44.840
How did you not think this through?

38:46.216 --> 38:47.724
You betrayed me.

38:47.776 --> 38:50.913
- You betrayed America.
- I'm a patriot!

38:51.575 --> 38:53.101
A patriot!

38:53.356 --> 38:56.462
Unlike all of you
pacifists who refused to see

38:56.468 --> 38:58.568
that America can have
everything it wants.

38:58.595 --> 39:01.344
It just needs a reason to take it.

39:02.565 --> 39:04.970
Which you are about to provide, hmm?

39:04.993 --> 39:06.300
I'm gonna kill you both

39:06.336 --> 39:07.737
and then disappear

39:07.940 --> 39:09.897
and let the evidence speak for itself.

39:25.149 --> 39:27.106
Put the weapon down, Clegg.

39:40.981 --> 39:44.040
There you are, you son of a gun!

39:44.269 --> 39:46.577
Son of...

40:03.819 --> 40:06.894
A quarter inch to the left and
it would have pierced the aorta.

40:07.019 --> 40:09.333
Be grateful for a punctured lung.

40:10.118 --> 40:12.553
I'm grateful for many things, Doctor.

40:13.613 --> 40:15.938
Yes, well, we can all be grateful.

40:16.780 --> 40:18.174
Ah yes.

40:18.207 --> 40:20.372
I believe congratulations are in order.

40:23.388 --> 40:24.983
You told him?

40:25.754 --> 40:27.292
He's a spy.

40:27.297 --> 40:28.685
He can keep a secret.

40:31.270 --> 40:33.233
With my life if necessary.

40:34.943 --> 40:36.382
Thank you.

40:51.155 --> 40:54.419
If it's a boy, I quite like Julian.

40:55.387 --> 40:56.901
Julian?

40:57.955 --> 40:59.555
After you.

41:01.001 --> 41:02.417
William...

41:03.620 --> 41:06.990
I don't want him to be
named after me, or you!

41:10.431 --> 41:12.878
I want him to have his own name.

41:19.176 --> 41:20.737
Daniel.

41:24.375 --> 41:26.511
I've always loved the name Daniel.

41:28.716 --> 41:31.315
Well then, Daniel it shall be.

41:55.764 --> 41:57.981
I suppose Clegg will hang this time?

41:59.334 --> 42:01.694
After our boys have
had a chat with him...

42:01.758 --> 42:03.686
an extensive chat.

42:04.895 --> 42:07.998
Sir... with regard to recent events,

42:08.033 --> 42:10.617
I'm of the opinion it
serves both our interests...

42:10.640 --> 42:12.828
That no one find out about this.

42:12.953 --> 42:15.524
You did come to Canada
without permission.

42:16.034 --> 42:19.061
You almost arranged my assassination.

42:20.560 --> 42:22.293
Shall we call it even, then?

42:25.995 --> 42:28.805
I concur that history need
not record this matter.

42:29.248 --> 42:33.517
- But as for your Prime Minister...
- He need not be apprised, sir.

42:34.754 --> 42:36.378
All right.

42:36.503 --> 42:40.250
Sir, will you not be going
after the Great White Moose?

42:40.283 --> 42:43.253
My misadventure cost
the life of a good man

42:43.318 --> 42:45.124
and very nearly two others.

42:45.326 --> 42:48.068
I've set eyes on the beast.
That will have to be enough.

42:49.183 --> 42:51.940
Thank you for saving my life yet again.

42:52.833 --> 42:54.530
Always a pleasure.

42:55.344 --> 42:56.966
Driver.

43:02.770 --> 43:05.341
Well... Clegg,

43:06.246 --> 43:08.081
I suppose this is it.

43:08.383 --> 43:10.145
I'll be seeing you in hell,

43:10.178 --> 43:11.888
- I'm sure.
- Perhaps.

43:11.924 --> 43:14.283
But not before I publish your novel.

43:14.853 --> 43:17.353
Under the name Guillermo Burgos.
