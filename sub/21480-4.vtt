00:01.000 --> 00:02.500
[Previously on the 4400...]

00:04.487 --> 00:05.982
We're not sure what's just happened.

00:06.017 --> 00:06.300
The light is gone,

00:06.400 --> 00:08.600
and thousands of people have just suddenly appeared.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.200
Tom is the best agent I've ever worked with,

00:10.300 --> 00:11.700
maybe the best you've got in this división.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.000
I thought I was being re-assigned to field duty.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.500
You are, effective immediately.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.500
Work's been a little crazy lately

00:15.535 --> 00:16.500
oh, the job?

00:16.600 --> 00:17.700
I've been waiting for that one.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.400
It finally feels like old times around here.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.800
April, glad to hear from you. You're my sister.

00:21.900 --> 00:22.700
Surprised?

00:22.800 --> 00:24.200
How come I've never met you before?

00:24.300 --> 00:25.600
- It's complicated.
- We've been busy.

00:25.700 --> 00:26.600
I'm shawn farrell.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.400
I am one of the 4400.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.400
Can I sign you up for a tour?

00:29.500 --> 00:31.100
I was looking for cousin, shawn farrell.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.500
Policy prohibits me from discussing our membership.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.100
Been to that place where you're living.

00:35.200 --> 00:38.100
There's some serious stepford wives vibes going on there.

00:38.135 --> 00:38.900
You know that, right?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.400
These centers, they're a chance to bring people together.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.100
Sounds like someone got inside your head.

00:43.200 --> 00:47.000
I will not allow these shadows from your past to alter your perceptions.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.700
The goal is what matters.

00:48.800 --> 00:49.700
Ensure the future.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.600
Save the planet.

00:51.700 --> 00:53.500
If maia's having visions, you should know about it

00:53.600 --> 00:55.100
and you should know what they are.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.100
Isabelle is six months old.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.300
I don't know why she talks to me and not to you.

00:59.335 --> 00:59.800
Talks?

00:59.900 --> 01:01.100
Ntac? Collier?

01:01.200 --> 01:01.865
I don't know who it is,

01:01.900 --> 01:03.600
but someone knows we're 4400s.

01:03.700 --> 01:05.700
Start packing

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.600 --> 01:19.700
How'd it go today, daddy?

01:20.900 --> 01:22.500
That bad, huh?

01:22.600 --> 01:25.800
Nobody wants to buy time shares in wilmington, idaho.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.500
Baja california, maybe.

01:27.600 --> 01:28.600
If I were you, I'd go in there

01:28.700 --> 01:31.100
and tell them "either let me have the good listings,

01:31.200 --> 01:31.700
or I quit".

01:31.800 --> 01:34.400
The whole staff wants baja, honey

01:34.500 --> 01:35.500
and I don't have the seniority.

01:35.600 --> 01:36.200
How is that fair?

01:36.300 --> 01:37.800
You've been a salesman longer than any of them.

01:37.900 --> 01:39.200
Salesman, not telemarketer.

01:39.235 --> 01:41.000
It's different.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.400
Hey, hey. Appelbaum.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.700
Payday.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.000
Leave him alone!

01:47.100 --> 01:49.600
He's trying to pay you back!

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
This your beer, appelbaum?

01:55.500 --> 01:57.200
You don't mind if I quench my thirst, do you?

01:57.300 --> 01:58.400
Honey, stay back.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.100
Stay back.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.900
I just need a couple more weeks.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.500
Something will turn around.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.800
You know, in my business

02:05.900 --> 02:07.400
you hear every sob story in the book

02:07.500 --> 02:09.400
but I got to tell you, yours is a new one

02:09.500 --> 02:10.800
"disappeared 15 years ago,

02:10.900 --> 02:12.000
"came back in a ball of light

02:12.100 --> 02:13.000
wife died

02:13.100 --> 02:14.500
daughter dropped out of school

02:14.600 --> 02:15.800
"You got a bad break,

02:15.900 --> 02:17.400
but you borrowed the money,

02:17.500 --> 02:18.700
and now you're going to have to pay me back.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.600
I'll figure something out.

02:20.700 --> 02:21.600
Oh, you do it quickly,

02:21.700 --> 02:24.600
because you and I are going to talk again in 48 hours.

02:24.700 --> 02:27.800
I thought you 4400s got special powers.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.800
How come you're such a big nothing?

02:29.900 --> 02:32.300
Just lucky, I guess.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.100
All right, let's go.

02:41.100 --> 02:42.900
Thanks for the beer.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.700
Should be at eric's place tomorrow.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.900
Be nice to see a friendly face,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
maybe sleep in for a change.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.200
Sounds good.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.200
You like eric, right?

03:01.300 --> 03:03.800
Yes You guys got along in quarantine.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.600
Richard, I'm late.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.000
Like, "I might be pregnant" late.

03:11.100 --> 03:11.700
You sure?

03:11.800 --> 03:13.000
No, I'm not sure.

03:13.100 --> 03:14.800
I'm late.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.700
Well, we just have to wait and see.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.200
Wait and see?

03:23.300 --> 03:25.700
We could go to the drug store, maybe...

03:26.000 --> 03:28.800
get one of those test things.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.900
And what would you want it to say?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.300
I'd like it to say, "congratulations.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.300
You have a job, a house, and a future.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.400
You're ready for another child.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.100
"But I don't think it's going to say that.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.600
No.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.500
Probably not.

03:44.500 --> 03:49.100
$3,150... 32, 33... $3,400.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.200
Well, that should keep that creep happy for a while.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.500
I'm sorry about your car.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.000
I'll ride the bus to work.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.200
Sorry about the televisión.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.100
I'll read a book.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.500
Appelbaum, the miracle man, huh?

04:04.600 --> 04:07.100
You notice anything different about me?

04:08.100 --> 04:10.500
My god...

04:10.700 --> 04:13.400
75 pounds in two days.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.900
Now, at first, I thought the termites had gotten me.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.200
You know, I was sick... cancer.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.200
Doctors ran all the tests. Turns out I'm fine.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.000
But

04:19.100 --> 04:20.000
how could I lose all that weight?

04:20.100 --> 04:22.500
Then I thought of you.

04:22.600 --> 04:23.500
Me and you, we shared a bottle of beer,

04:23.600 --> 04:25.300
and you're one of those 4400s.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.200
What does that prove?

04:26.300 --> 04:27.100
Nothing yet.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.900
But let's... let's find out.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.100
I want you to take a sip.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.000
Because if I'm right,

04:31.100 --> 04:32.200
you made me lose all this weight,

04:32.300 --> 04:34.300
and then the same thing should happen to my wife.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.200
Who... mm...

04:35.300 --> 04:36.300
though I love very much,

04:36.400 --> 04:39.400
I do... could stand to lose maybe 20 pounds.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.000
30.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.800
Go ahead.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.400
Drink up.

04:45.300 --> 04:46.300
Applebaum...

04:46.400 --> 04:47.200
these people who took you,

04:47.300 --> 04:49.500
they set you up for life.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.300
They snatched up a bum salesman,

04:51.400 --> 04:55.100
and they sent you back "the human diet."

04:55.400 --> 04:57.400
"The human diet."

04:58.600 --> 05:00.300
I like that.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.600
Go ahead.

05:25.200 --> 05:30.400
* So long ago, another life *

05:30.500 --> 05:34.100
 * I can feel your heart beat *

05:34.600 --> 05:39.700
* it's not a dream, remember us *

05:39.800 --> 05:43.900
 * I can see it in your eyes *

05:44.000 --> 05:47.400
* we'll find our place in time *

05:47.500 --> 05:52.100
* our place in time beyond the sun *

05:53.300 --> 05:56.600
* we'll find our place in time *

05:56.700 --> 06:02.000
* our place in time to call our own *

06:17.200 --> 06:17.799
Chloe

06:20.600 --> 06:22.500
thank you thank you

06:22.501 --> 06:26.001
reading Jordan's book was an absolute Revelation

06:26.002 --> 06:31.002
I bought copies for all my back up dangers
and we discuss it every night after the show

06:31.003 --> 06:32.203
she cut her tour short

06:32.204 --> 06:35.904
yes, because i felt like i had to be here

06:35.905 --> 06:39.205
obviously, i'm not one of 4400

06:39.206 --> 06:42.606
but i expect to be treated just like any other student here

06:42.607 --> 06:45.607
if i'm lucky enough

06:45.608 --> 06:47.708
to tap into an ability

06:47.709 --> 06:52.709
i will use it to ensure the worid a brighter future

06:52.710 --> 06:57.310
congratulations, Chloe Greezer, you have achieved "first key"

07:03.711 --> 07:05.011
thank you

07:06.812 --> 07:09.112
Last year, she was into Compila.

07:11.813 --> 07:14.613
It's amazing, i lost 23 pounds

07:14.614 --> 07:17.614
i haven't weighed less than 130 since college

07:18.200 --> 07:19.915
told you applebaum was a real deal, right?

07:19.916 --> 07:21.416
You have been happy harrassing him anymore

07:21.417 --> 07:25.017
honey, what we got from him is way more than he owns me, right?

07:25.018 --> 07:26.218
Come on

07:28.518 --> 07:29.084
turn around

07:29.119 --> 07:31.019
Question of the day

07:31.020 --> 07:34.620
who is Trent Applebaum and why is Drandix coporation calling me about it.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.020
Applebaum disappeared in the late 80's

07:37.021 --> 07:38.621
he's in phone-sells, right?

07:38.622 --> 07:40.722
And now he's selling himself

07:40.723 --> 07:43.723
he claimed that his saliva is catalogued for weight loss

07:45.224 --> 07:46.824
Applebaum backed his claim up?

07:46.825 --> 07:49.125
Two good satisfied customers

07:49.126 --> 07:52.726
married couple, one drop 75 pounds, the other 23

07:52.727 --> 07:54.027
particularly over a night

07:54.028 --> 07:55.528
my god

07:55.929 --> 07:57.629
they got a hand of the future on this one

07:57.630 --> 08:00.830
if they really give him this ability, it could be the cure for adiposity

08:00.831 --> 08:01.830
yeah, it will change the worid

08:01.831 --> 08:04.131
that's about to change Trent Applebaum's worid

08:04.132 --> 08:06.232
he hired a lawyer, an agent

08:06.233 --> 08:08.033
they were asking 20 million dollars

08:08.034 --> 08:10.634
but Trent's in a bidding war with three other company so...

08:10.635 --> 08:12.200
who knows what the final number will end up

08:12.201 --> 08:15.801
a 4400 selling exclusive rights to his ability is legal

08:15.802 --> 08:17.402
our lawyer is looking into conjunction

08:17.403 --> 08:20.603
but at the moment, no legislation specifically prevents it

08:20.638 --> 08:22.603
then our guy Stands to be a very rich man

08:22.604 --> 08:23.104
hmm

08:23.105 --> 08:24.505
maybe we should go see him

08:24.506 --> 08:26.906
yeah, find out if he's really worth 20 million dollars

08:37.407 --> 08:39.006
hey hey jet pilot

08:41.707 --> 08:42.308
did i get it right?

08:42.308 --> 08:43.509
Close enough

08:44.810 --> 08:48.410
so... you sounded a little freaked out on the phone
anything i should know about?

08:51.201 --> 08:52.411
Better that you don't

08:56.712 --> 09:00.212
look at you two, love birds from quarantine building B

09:00.913 --> 09:04.813
this little cutie must be Isabelle. Your daddy told me all about you

09:05.014 --> 09:06.614
i bet he did

09:08.515 --> 09:10.515
look, come on in. I'll show you guys the guest room

09:10.516 --> 09:12.316
or maybe somebody sleep on the couch

09:15.907 --> 09:18.307
not too shabby from my first college

09:18.308 --> 09:20.508
it was a good paper, well fall out

09:20.509 --> 09:22.109
so what's the minus for?

09:22.110 --> 09:24.710
Well, i always like to leave a bit room for improvement

09:27.411 --> 09:29.411
last days of pompeii

09:29.412 --> 09:30.912
yeah, they throw that party every year

09:30.913 --> 09:33.513
you should go, go out some steam you've earned it

09:34.814 --> 09:36.814
i hate to go alone, you're up for it?

09:37.315 --> 09:40.315
I probably love to have remembered that threat

09:40.316 --> 09:43.616
not my scene, but don't let me stop you

09:44.207 --> 09:46.907
i don't know how it works, they put something inside me

09:46.908 --> 09:49.308
one of those enzyme or whatever

09:49.309 --> 09:52.309
so someone drinks from the same bottle as you do and they lose weight

09:52.310 --> 09:53.980
maybe we should give him a demonstration

09:53.981 --> 09:55.481
cut it out, Louis

09:55.482 --> 09:57.182
she thinks she needs to lose eight pounds

09:57.183 --> 09:57.783
try ten

09:57.784 --> 10:00.584
sweetie, you're beautiful, you don't need to lose anything

10:00.585 --> 10:02.385
he's right about that, you don't

10:03.486 --> 10:05.386
a lot of kids go to college when they're eighteen

10:05.387 --> 10:07.487
and Lis had to take a job at a diner

10:07.688 --> 10:09.288
we were apart for sixteen years

10:09.289 --> 10:12.589
but while i was gone, they gave me a way to make it up to her

10:15.390 --> 10:18.490
Mr. Applebaum, no one's telling you not to provide for your daughter

10:18.491 --> 10:21.891
but a 4400 putting his gift on the open market is the first

10:21.892 --> 10:23.592
we wanna make sure nobody gets to take advantage of that

10:23.593 --> 10:25.193
not you, not the buyer, other 4400...

10:25.194 --> 10:27.094
you don't have to teach me about selling

10:27.095 --> 10:29.195
i've been a salesman my whole life

10:29.696 --> 10:31.096
most of the stuff i paddled

10:31.097 --> 10:32.597
junk

10:32.598 --> 10:37.798
but now i got the product that everybody wants
and only i can provide, i'm the damn product

10:38.299 --> 10:40.799
nobody is putting Trent Appelbaum back in the bottle

10:42.906 --> 10:45.306
my father fought in Korea, infantry

10:46.007 --> 10:47.307
i flew in 36

10:47.308 --> 10:48.308
Eric told me

10:48.309 --> 10:49.809
daddy admired you guys

10:49.810 --> 10:54.200
he said there were only 25 black pilots in the whole air force
who allowed to flylike everybody else

10:54.201 --> 10:55.901
there weren't a lot of us, it's true

10:55.902 --> 10:58.802
the first person i met long time ago
couldn't metion the Korea War

10:58.803 --> 11:03.200
that was a big deal in our house, we always go to pray

11:03.201 --> 11:05.901
yeah, my grandfather and my mom said he'd take me too

11:05.902 --> 11:08.402
except it was called "Armistice Day" back day

11:08.403 --> 11:09.603
for worid war one

11:10.004 --> 11:12.304
put on those boot dress, go visit old buddy

11:13.505 --> 11:16.005
daddy looks so handsome in his uniform

11:16.006 --> 11:17.406
i bet you'd too

11:17.807 --> 11:19.607
i'd like to meet him sometime

11:19.808 --> 11:21.608
yeah, well, too late

11:21.609 --> 11:24.409
he passed away two years ago this August

11:24.410 --> 11:25.510
i'm sorry to hear that

11:25.511 --> 11:27.211
thank you

11:27.212 --> 11:29.212
he would really love to meet you too

11:29.513 --> 11:32.413
the guy was 81, he was born four years after i was

11:32.414 --> 11:34.614
well, lucky for you, i like elder man

11:34.615 --> 11:37.515
so Rrichard, we've known what were you up to in 1951

11:37.816 --> 11:39.516
how about lately

11:39.817 --> 11:42.317
well, i've been working as an alternate weekend

11:42.318 --> 11:43.618
oh, really?

11:43.619 --> 11:47.219
So what brings you to this part of the country, it's kind of remote for vacation

11:47.220 --> 11:50.920
they came to see me, as 4400, we gotta stick together

11:51.421 --> 11:54.521
we have bond that you mere human will never understand

11:55.022 --> 11:58.422
Eric, you freak me out when you talk that 4400 unity crap

12:04.203 --> 12:06.123
not much of a talker, are you, Lily?

12:08.204 --> 12:11.224
I'm not really used to be in social situation since these days

12:12.325 --> 12:14.225
you are a luky man

12:14.226 --> 12:16.126
with this one here

12:18.927 --> 12:21.327
but i guess you already noticed that, didn't you?

12:24.328 --> 12:27.728
I have to pee for about 75th-time today

12:27.729 --> 12:29.429
i have to change Issabelle

12:34.707 --> 12:36.107
that thing is beautiful

12:36.408 --> 12:37.908
other all beautiful

12:37.909 --> 12:41.109
i just like them better in this book than i do on somebody's shoulder

12:41.710 --> 12:43.010
you don't get it, Día(Diana)

12:43.011 --> 12:45.411
This drawing are not meant live on the page

12:45.412 --> 12:47.212
they're meant to live on the skin

12:47.213 --> 12:48.613
that's very deep

12:48.814 --> 12:50.514
but you're right, i don't get it

12:50.515 --> 12:52.015
i do

12:53.716 --> 12:59.116
ok, you got to let this brilliant little girl go with me tomorrow

12:59.917 --> 13:01.017
it's a tattoo shop

13:01.018 --> 13:02.818
a boddy art emporium

13:02.819 --> 13:04.619
and for five hours tomorrow

13:04.620 --> 13:06.620
i'm the featured artist

13:06.821 --> 13:08.721
you must be pretty good

13:08.922 --> 13:12.322
can we go just for a little while

13:15.023 --> 13:16.200
one hour

13:20.901 --> 13:23.001
Shawn, have you seen Chloe's schedule?

13:23.002 --> 13:24.802
Why would i see Chloe's schedule, Devon?

13:24.803 --> 13:27.803
She has an interview with media three o'clock tomorrow?

13:28.304 --> 13:30.604
Oh, hopefully, she will mention the center

13:30.605 --> 13:33.405
but her nutrition and purification class is at three o'clock

13:33.606 --> 13:36.806
yeah, i think i heard Jordan said she was excused from the...

13:36.807 --> 13:39.707
she's been on the microbiotic diet for three years

13:39.708 --> 13:40.708
also she says

13:41.409 --> 13:45.809
look, i'm sure Jordan plans on treating Chloe like any other student

13:46.110 --> 13:47.410
Ok?

14:06.511 --> 14:07.811
No, i'm ready to close.

14:07.812 --> 14:09.212
I don't wanna wait, just tell him it's done

14:09.213 --> 14:10.213
and i'll be in tomorrow

14:11.200 --> 14:13.014
alright, thanks, Celine

14:13.915 --> 14:15.115
how much?

14:15.616 --> 14:18.116
40 million dollars

14:21.217 --> 14:22.317
come up

14:22.318 --> 14:23.318
it's on its way

14:23.319 --> 14:25.619
but sir, this will be your fourth stake

14:25.620 --> 14:26.420
we're hungry

14:26.421 --> 14:28.521
Ok, just hate to see make yourself sick

14:28.522 --> 14:31.822
no one is sick, we're hungry and starving, now go go

14:31.823 --> 14:33.323
get your hands up, please, go

14:33.624 --> 14:35.424
i'm starving

14:46.900 --> 14:49.800
Morning... you're not dressed?

14:49.900 --> 14:52.700
Those guys from arkham films are here to pitch us.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.200
Oh, the recruitment video.

14:54.300 --> 14:57.400
Yeah, well, you can handle that meeting, can't you?

14:57.500 --> 14:58.300
Well, yeah, sure,

14:58.400 --> 14:59.500
if you're too busy, yeah.

14:59.600 --> 15:00.900
Hey.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.300
Guess jordan's getting a late start this morning.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.300
My bad.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.000
I'm going to just jump in the shower, okay?

15:06.100 --> 15:08.200
Shower sounds good, chloe.

15:08.300 --> 15:09.500
Close your mouth, shawn.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.700
You'll draw flies.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.600
One-on-one tutoring with a first key?

15:15.700 --> 15:17.200
That'S. That's new.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.500
First key or not,

15:18.600 --> 15:19.300
chloe demands...

15:19.400 --> 15:21.700
deserves a different level of attention.

15:21.800 --> 15:22.900
She's our entree, shawn,

15:23.000 --> 15:24.300
into the entertainment community.

15:24.400 --> 15:29.700
Jordan, you have an entire chapter in your book that rips celebrity culture.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.600
It's a cancer that separates people,

15:31.700 --> 15:34.000
that helps define the haves and have-nots.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.000
And 4400 culture is all about unity.

15:36.100 --> 15:36.865
Yes. Please, shawn

15:36.900 --> 15:38.300
do not quote me back to myself.

15:38.400 --> 15:42.800
The fact is, celebrities have deep pockets and deeper insecurities,

15:42.900 --> 15:46.400
and we can use both to our advantage.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.500
You can be a manipulative prick.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.200
You know that?

15:49.300 --> 15:50.400
Yeah.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.600
Well.

15:52.300 --> 15:56.900
It helps to use your entire skill set when you're trying to change the worid.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.800
You and lily should think about putting down some roots here.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.700
I think all this running is fraying you both around the edges.

16:06.800 --> 16:07.800
You noticed.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.900
Hard not to.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.400
You can do a lot worse than white bird.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.600
It's quiet.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.400
Everyone minds their own business.

16:17.700 --> 16:21.000
Eventually you're going to have to stop criss-crossing the highways.

16:21.100 --> 16:24.000
Might as well do it here, before you run out of road.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.000
Thank you, by the way.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.100
For not asking what we're running from.

16:28.200 --> 16:31.400
I figured if you wanted me to know, you'd tell me.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.600
Look, richard.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.300
I got all the work I can handle up in livingston,

16:36.400 --> 16:39.500
keeping up these movie stars' second homes.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.600
I could use a hand.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.600
You offering me a job?

16:45.700 --> 16:47.100
They used to call us handymen.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.800
Now we're property managers.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.200
Either way, you'd be working with me,

16:52.300 --> 16:54.100
not for me.

16:59.300 --> 17:02.500
And if you'll just sign right here...

17:10.200 --> 17:13.900
as agreed... your signing bonus.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.900
When do I start?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.599
You're making breakfast.

17:26.700 --> 17:29.900
As you pour the milk over your cereal,

17:30.000 --> 17:35.400
you notice that there's a photo of a missing child on the side of the carton.

17:35.500 --> 17:41.000
It takes you a moment to realize that it's a picture of you at 10 years old.

17:41.100 --> 17:43.100
This one's giving me the chills.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.100
Who's making this stuff up?

17:45.200 --> 17:46.200
Moron.

17:46.300 --> 17:49.500
Devon, do not let jordan hear you say that.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.400
The two of them hooked up last night.

17:52.900 --> 17:56.700
Yeah, and by the looks of it, probably this morning, too.

17:56.800 --> 18:01.000
There's a telephone number on the missing persons report.

18:01.100 --> 18:04.800
It's the number of your childhood home.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.900
Stay here?

18:24.800 --> 18:26.100
You mean permanently?

18:26.200 --> 18:27.700
It's a nice town,

18:27.800 --> 18:30.900
and eric says I can start work tomorrow.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.400
Look, lily.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.800
We've got to get you off the road,

18:36.900 --> 18:39.100
especially if you're pregnant again.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.800
I'm not.

18:41.500 --> 18:42.600
You sure?

18:42.700 --> 18:44.800
Positive.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.000
Please don't try and pretend you're not relieved.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.900
Relieved?

18:52.000 --> 18:55.300
Lily, I was trying to wrap my head around it, that's all.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.200
Especially if we're not going to be running anymore.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.900
I don't know about this place, richard.

19:03.000 --> 19:03.700
Isabelle thinks...

19:03.800 --> 19:06.000
oh, let me guess.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.100
We should move on.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.000
I was hoping we could go to salem, oregon.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.100
I have some relatives there.

19:11.200 --> 19:14.000
I think they might be willing to help us out and keep quiet about it.

19:14.100 --> 19:14.800
Salem?

19:14.900 --> 19:16.600
That's a city.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.800
Maybe we could get lost in a crowd for a change.

19:20.900 --> 19:22.800
This place

19:23.200 --> 19:25.300
this life, it feels right to me.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.200
This is eric's life.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.000
It's not yours.

19:30.100 --> 19:32.600
It's not ours.

19:42.700 --> 19:44.600
No, this is not a negotiating stance.

19:44.700 --> 19:45.900
It's my answer... no.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.600
Goodbye.

19:47.700 --> 19:49.900
So let me guess... the answer is no?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.100
That was a rep from the yoyotron corp.

19:52.200 --> 19:57.000
They want to sign maia to a $300,000-a-year holding contract.

19:57.100 --> 19:58.700
But maia doesn't have any ability anymore.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.400
Well, you don't need any to make any of these deals.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.200
They're signing 4400s up on spec.

20:02.300 --> 20:05.800
They want them in their pocket in case something develops down the line.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.800
Well, you did the right thing by saying no.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.000
Tom.

20:10.100 --> 20:12.000
About maia.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.200
What? She's okay, isn't she?

20:15.300 --> 20:17.000
She's fine.

20:18.200 --> 20:21.800
I've been trying to figure out the right time to tell you this.

20:21.900 --> 20:24.700
I probably should have done it right away, but.

20:26.500 --> 20:29.100
You know those visions that maia used to have?

20:29.200 --> 20:33.000
It turns out she was only pretending that they stopped.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.100
How long have you known?

20:38.200 --> 20:39.100
Not long.

20:39.200 --> 20:42.600
I only found out because I read her diary,

20:42.800 --> 20:45.100
but it was an eyeful.

20:45.900 --> 20:46.900
You going to tell jarvis?

20:47.000 --> 20:51.900
I'd rather not turn my daughter's diary over to the government.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.300
Hey, don't give me that look, tom.

20:54.400 --> 20:58.200
You kept shawn's ability to yourself for quite some time.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.300
Guess we're even now.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.600
See how cool that looks?

21:09.700 --> 21:11.700
Your aunt, she's a real artist.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.000
Oh, say it again, billy boy.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.800
I don't think my sister heard you.

21:15.900 --> 21:16.900
Oh, I heard him.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
You're a star.

21:18.100 --> 21:18.900
Believe it.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.400
As soon as I heard april was appearing here,

21:20.500 --> 21:22.300
I booked my time right away.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.400
So did pretty much all of my buddies.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.200
That's impressive.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.100
I'm proud of you.

21:28.200 --> 21:28.900
Wait a minute.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.800
You didn't actually just say
that you were proud of me?

21:31.900 --> 21:33.900
Cut it out. Of course I am.

21:34.100 --> 21:37.000
I always thought you thought I was a loser.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.300
Did you really think that?

21:39.400 --> 21:40.700
Yeah, I really did.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.365
April.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.300
All I said was that I liked the tattoo.

21:45.300 --> 21:48.500
You don't always wear your helmet, do you?

21:49.100 --> 21:51.000
You should wear one tonight.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.600
Why's that?

21:52.700 --> 21:56.200
You won't make it over to
monica's house if you don't.

21:57.100 --> 21:58.600
Does that hurt?

21:58.700 --> 22:01.100
How do you know about my girlfriend?

22:02.800 --> 22:05.700
I really think you should wear your helmet.

23:16.700 --> 23:17.200
You killed her.

23:17.235 --> 23:18.200
Dmitri?

23:18.300 --> 23:19.200
What happened to you?

23:19.300 --> 23:20.800
My wife, she's gone.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.800
Doctors say that she starved to death.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.800
I'm next.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.500
You killed us both.

23:40.300 --> 23:41.300
How many times am I supposed to tell you?

23:41.400 --> 23:42.800
I don't know how I got to that store.

23:42.900 --> 23:44.500
And I sure as hell don't
remember breaking any window.

23:44.535 --> 23:46.000
Not remembering is no excuse.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.500
And stop telling me somebody spiked your drink.

23:48.600 --> 23:49.500
The police ran tests. Kyle.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.000
There's no ghb in your system.

23:51.035 --> 23:51.800
What else could it be?

23:51.900 --> 23:53.200
You spent three years in a coma.

23:53.300 --> 23:55.900
You have no business drinking anything!

23:56.000 --> 23:56.900
Okay. So I screwed up.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.300
I'm sorry. What more do you want?

23:58.400 --> 24:00.500
How about acknowledging that this was serious?

24:00.600 --> 24:02.800
Do you know how close they were to
charging you with breaking and entering?

24:02.900 --> 24:04.600
Which by the way is a felony.

24:04.700 --> 24:05.800
If I didn't play the ntac card.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.300
You'd be sitting in a jail cell right now.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.000
Can I go to bed?

24:08.100 --> 24:09.400
No. This is serious.

24:09.500 --> 24:10.600
You want to make up for last time.

24:10.700 --> 24:11.300
Kyle. I get it.

24:11.335 --> 24:12.700
I get it.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.700
But we need to talk about
some ground rules for you.

24:14.800 --> 24:15.300
I'm not a kid.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.565
I don't need ground rules.

24:16.600 --> 24:19.400
I wouldn't know that from tonight.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.500
Answer it.

24:24.100 --> 24:25.700
What?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.700
You're kidding me.

24:34.900 --> 24:37.000
Yeah. I'll be right in.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.300
We'll finish this later.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.800
What happened to laying down the law?

24:42.300 --> 24:45.000
Oh. Right. Something more important came up.

24:46.700 --> 24:48.600
Just go upstairs. Kyle.

24:48.700 --> 24:51.100
Just go upstairs.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.900
Richard?

25:06.200 --> 25:07.300
What are you doing out here?

25:07.400 --> 25:08.600
Oh. I'm just getting some air.

25:08.700 --> 25:11.300
Well. Hop in. We'll give you a ride back.

25:23.600 --> 25:27.300
I was reading about your air
force unit on the internet yesterday.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.500
No kidding.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.400
I looked at it a couple times too.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.800
You guys were one of the most decorated flying squads...

25:32.835 --> 25:33.300
tara.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.900
Will you stop pestering the man about his past?

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
It's okay.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.900
I don't mind.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.200
Well. As long as you're feeling talkative.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.300
I've got a question for you...

25:42.400 --> 25:46.800
what did a brother have to do back in the '50s
before they'd let you fly a plane. Huh?

25:46.900 --> 25:48.400
Polish the officer's boots on the weekends?

25:48.500 --> 25:49.400
David.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.700
No. No. No. Seriously. I mean.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.000
I'm wondering.

25:52.100 --> 25:55.600
Boy must've done some serious bowing and
scraping before they'd hand you them keys. Right?

25:55.700 --> 25:58.000
Okay. That is enough.

25:58.300 --> 25:59.500
I'm so sorry. Richard.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.800
No problem.

26:00.900 --> 26:04.900
Some people the less they know the more they talk.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.900
Oh. I know some things.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.700
I know a lot more than you realize.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.400
What's that supposed to mean?

26:10.500 --> 26:13.000
It means quit fawning over the
man and keep your mouth closed.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.400
Why don't you just let me out right here?

26:14.500 --> 26:15.300
Hey.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.800
You sit back and relax. Huh?

26:17.900 --> 26:19.500
Now this here?

26:19.600 --> 26:21.700
It's called marriage.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.500
That's all.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.100
You know what I'm talking about.

26:29.900 --> 26:31.000
Dmitri's dead?

26:31.100 --> 26:35.000
Organ failure resulting from
malnutrition just like his wife.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.300
They were supposed to lose 20 or 30 pounds.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.500
Not starve to death.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.300
Are you sure there isn't anyone else?

26:45.400 --> 26:46.100
Family?

26:46.200 --> 26:46.600
Friends?

26:46.700 --> 26:47.100
No.

26:47.200 --> 26:47.900
Did you kiss anyone?

26:48.000 --> 26:48.700
Share a drinking glass?

26:48.800 --> 26:50.600
No. There's no one else.

26:50.700 --> 26:53.200
We think we know what happened to the kazars.

26:53.300 --> 26:57.300
There's a protein in your saliva that
hyper-accelerated their metabolism.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.600
It's a cagey one too.

26:58.700 --> 27:04.100
It stimulates the brain to release epinephrine
and it breaks down fat cells at the same time.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.800
No wonder they burned up calories
faster than their bodies could take them in.

27:06.900 --> 27:10.100
Well. They could eat anything and
everything and still starve to death.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.700
That doesn't make any sense.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.300
We're supposed to be helping people. Right?

27:14.400 --> 27:17.000
That's why we were sent back.

27:20.100 --> 27:21.900
All I wanted was to make good for my daughter.

27:22.000 --> 27:22.900
Now I'm a murderer.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.600
You didn't mean to do it trent.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.200
That supposed to make me feel better?

27:26.300 --> 27:28.200
We're going to have to keep you here.

27:28.300 --> 27:31.600
Try and find a way to remove the protein from your system.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.900
Well. The good news is we caught it early.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.600
A lot more people could have been infected.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.100
Oh. No.

27:38.500 --> 27:41.000
I was at drandix this morning.

27:41.700 --> 27:45.200
I spent two hours in their lab giving tissue samples.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.400
Oh my god.

27:49.500 --> 27:50.700
Look this isn't my fault.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.900
And I have the documents to prove it.

27:53.000 --> 27:53.900
How many people did you test?

27:54.000 --> 27:54.860
Look. My bosses.

27:54.861 --> 27:57.368
They wanted a clinical trial up
and running by the end of the day.

27:57.403 --> 27:58.300
They said."make it your top priority."

27:58.335 --> 28:00.100
How many?

28:00.700 --> 28:02.200
A hundred.

28:06.500 --> 28:06.900
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.100
Hey. What's going on?

28:08.200 --> 28:10.100
What's going on?

28:29.100 --> 28:31.600
Why would devon try to kill herself?

28:31.700 --> 28:34.900
Obviously she's a very troubled young girl.

28:36.600 --> 28:37.900
But she's going to be okay though?

28:38.000 --> 28:38.600
Yeah.

28:38.700 --> 28:41.100
They were able to pump her
stomach out at the emergency room.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.500
She's at home recovering.

28:42.600 --> 28:42.865
Okay.

28:42.900 --> 28:46.500
I think what we need to
do right now is continue our work.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.300
Kyle if the cops say you didn't get "g"ed.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.600
You have to believe them right?

28:52.700 --> 28:53.600
They could have screwed up the test.

28:53.700 --> 28:55.300
I didn't drink that much.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.600
Well maybe your dad's right.

28:56.700 --> 28:58.600
Maybe you shouldn't drink at all.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.700
I hope it was just the booze.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.000
Well. What else could it have been?

29:06.200 --> 29:08.800
When I first came out of my coma.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.000
I wasn't quite myself.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I hope it's not happening again.

29:16.100 --> 29:18.700
I don't know exactly what you mean.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.100
But if you're losing chunks of time.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.600
You should talk to your dad about it.

29:21.700 --> 29:23.600
What's he going to do?
Turn me over to ntac medical?

29:23.700 --> 29:25.200
I'm not going back into quarantine.

29:25.300 --> 29:26.500
No way.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.700
If you're looking for eric...

29:43.000 --> 29:44.500
now there's your goddamn apology.

29:44.600 --> 29:45.400
What are you talking about?

29:45.500 --> 29:46.800
She was at me all morning.

29:46.900 --> 29:48.500
"Richard this." "Richard that."

29:48.600 --> 29:50.400
I should "go apologize."

29:50.500 --> 29:51.600
From here on in.

29:51.700 --> 29:53.500
You stay the hell away from my wife.

29:53.600 --> 29:54.800
You're crazy. Right?

29:54.900 --> 29:56.700
I've got nothing going on with your wife.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.700
Now you'd better step away
and take a deep breath or something.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.300
Man. I step where I please.

30:04.100 --> 30:05.600
Now. Listen to me.

30:05.700 --> 30:07.200
You're going to go home.

30:07.300 --> 30:09.600
And you're going to apologize to tara.

30:09.700 --> 30:11.500
And if you've got any brains at all.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.400
You're going to start treating her better.
Because if you don't.

30:13.500 --> 30:17.100
One day someone is going to take her away from you.

30:17.200 --> 30:20.000
Now get your ass out of here.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.100
Trent. This isn't helping.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.900
I had to see what I did.

30:35.000 --> 30:35.900
You want to do something?

30:36.000 --> 30:36.900
Get back to the lab.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.500
Help them work on a way to counter this.

30:41.400 --> 30:44.100
Just let me call elise first huh?

30:44.200 --> 30:46.800
She'll be wondering where I was all night.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.200
Help me.

31:01.300 --> 31:02.400
Elise?

31:02.500 --> 31:04.200
Daddy?

31:04.800 --> 31:06.600
Help me

31:13.200 --> 31:14.900
I'm sorry.

31:15.400 --> 31:18.500
I just wanted to lose 10 pounds.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.300
Baby.

31:20.700 --> 31:23.700
I told you you were perfect.

31:24.900 --> 31:26.900
I used one of your water glasses.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
We're going to get you help.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.800
We're going to get everybody help.

31:34.500 --> 31:35.600
Tom.

31:36.200 --> 31:36.800
We've got something.

31:36.900 --> 31:37.374
What?

31:37.375 --> 31:37.933
Tell me.

31:38.100 --> 31:42.000
Well. I asked the guys downstairs if we
could approach this like a smallpox vaccine

31:42.100 --> 31:45.600
use trace amounts of the antigen to build
resistance and counter the effects of the disease.

31:45.700 --> 31:46.700
These people are starving to death.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.800
Yeah. But it's because of a chemical reaction.

31:48.900 --> 31:50.600
Now. They biopsied trent's liver.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.300
That's where the protein is coming from.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.700
So if we extract this protein.

31:53.800 --> 31:57.400
They can make a serum that will stimulate
antibody production in the victims.

31:57.500 --> 32:00.100
But they're going to have
to harvest tissue to do it.

32:00.200 --> 32:01.700
How much of his liver would they have to use?

32:01.800 --> 32:03.200
Given how much time we have.

32:03.300 --> 32:05.500
They want to take all of it.

32:16.700 --> 32:18.000
I've never seen a sunset like that.

32:18.100 --> 32:20.500
The way it takes forever to go down.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.800
It's like it doesn't want to give up the sky.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.700
It's a pretty sky.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.100
Worth holding on to.

32:31.400 --> 32:32.800
I'm sorry.

32:32.900 --> 32:34.200
What for?

32:34.300 --> 32:35.800
For letting you believe even for a second.

32:35.900 --> 32:38.600
That I wouldn't want to have another child with you.

32:41.300 --> 32:42.800
I want to build a future for us lily.

32:42.900 --> 32:46.100
I just need to get my feet under me first.

32:46.200 --> 32:50.100
Well maybe if we stay here you can.

32:51.100 --> 32:52.900
I mean it richard.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.600
You love it here.

32:54.700 --> 32:57.100
I don't want to stand in the way of that.

32:59.300 --> 33:01.800
I'd sure hate to give up that sky.

33:02.500 --> 33:03.700
Me too.

33:09.100 --> 33:10.600
Are you even sure this will work?

33:10.700 --> 33:12.800
Well. It's elise's only shot...

33:12.900 --> 33:14.400
her and all the others.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.100
We've got a matching donor lined up.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.600
It's still a big risk.

33:17.700 --> 33:20.300
But say the word and the liver's on its way.

33:20.700 --> 33:21.900
Okay. Then.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.500
You want to close this deal.

33:25.600 --> 33:26.300
Here's the fine print...

33:26.400 --> 33:27.600
you want elise to go to school.

33:27.700 --> 33:29.400
It's already done.

33:29.500 --> 33:30.400
I talked to drandix.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.400
They've agreed to open up a college fund in her name.

33:36.800 --> 33:37.900
Sold.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.500
Great.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.100
Your mom put them in a vase for me.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.900
She's a very nice lady.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
They're very pretty shawn.

33:48.100 --> 33:49.400
But you didn't have to.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.400
Well I wanted to.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.500
I hope jordan's not too upset.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.700
No.

33:58.900 --> 33:59.607
No.

33:59.608 --> 34:00.295
Hey.

34:00.330 --> 34:03.300
He's probably too busy with his pet superstar.

34:03.400 --> 34:04.400
Devon.

34:05.400 --> 34:09.000
What are you doing thinking
about jordan and chloe right now?

34:10.500 --> 34:11.500
Hey.

34:11.800 --> 34:12.500
Hey.

34:12.600 --> 34:16.199
You have no idea how I feel about him.

34:18.500 --> 34:21.100
How deep it runs.

34:23.100 --> 34:27.300
I worship jordan for everything he's given me.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.699
For allowing me to be so close to him.

34:30.800 --> 34:34.699
He took me to a place I never thought possible.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.300
Devon.

34:38.800 --> 34:41.400
Are you telling me that you and jordan.

34:41.500 --> 34:44.500
Jordan's heart is full of love.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.300
He shares that love with me.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.500
It's an honor.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.600
An honor that chloe doesn't deserve.

34:51.699 --> 34:54.800
She's not a real student of jordan's.

34:59.500 --> 35:00.400
Billy?

35:00.500 --> 35:02.600
God. What happened to you?

35:02.700 --> 35:03.400
At the shop the other night.

35:03.500 --> 35:06.600
I got clipped by a car on the way out of the parking lot.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.900
But you were wearing your helmet. Weren't you?

35:09.000 --> 35:09.500
Yeah.

35:09.600 --> 35:12.100
Doctors said it saved my life.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.600
How'd you know that was going to happen to me?

35:15.700 --> 35:18.100
Children's intuition.

35:18.900 --> 35:20.200
I'm glad you're okay.

35:20.300 --> 35:21.200
Yeah.

35:22.100 --> 35:23.200
Me too.

35:26.800 --> 35:28.600
It's a shame to lose you so soon.

35:28.700 --> 35:29.800
Sucks huh?

35:29.900 --> 35:31.500
I thought my atlanta dates were pushed.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.900
Now they're threatening to sue if I don't show.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.700
You've made such progress
in such a short period of time.

35:37.800 --> 35:38.300
Yeah.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.300
Believe me. That doesn't happen very often.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.300
Well.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.300
I sure as hell hope not.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.000
You know me jordan...

35:45.100 --> 35:47.400
I like feeling special.

35:49.900 --> 35:51.500
You are.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.000
This was amazing.

35:54.100 --> 35:56.100
I can't wait to get back here.

35:56.700 --> 35:58.100
Goodbye.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.000
Talk about a quick study.

36:05.100 --> 36:07.300
Third key status in less than a week huh?

36:07.400 --> 36:09.400
Noblesse oblige shawn.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.300
She benefits and so do we.

36:11.400 --> 36:15.900
It's too bad all of the women that
you screw don't share the same benefits.

36:16.100 --> 36:17.500
That's cheap and childish.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.700
I expect more of you.

36:20.100 --> 36:21.400
I know the feeling.

36:25.900 --> 36:27.000
I am so sorry you two.

36:27.100 --> 36:27.600
What's wrong?

36:27.700 --> 36:28.500
It's david.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.200
He just looked on the website for the 4400s.

36:31.300 --> 36:32.600
It said that you two were missing.

36:32.700 --> 36:35.200
That you hadn't reported
in the way you were supposed to.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.000
I heard him on the phone just now.

36:37.100 --> 36:39.900
He's reporting you guys to the government.

36:48.800 --> 36:51.100
Sorry about that idiot david. Man.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.800
I would have loved to have you two around.

36:52.900 --> 36:54.900
Thanks for putting us up.

36:58.100 --> 37:00.000
Uh-uh. I can'T.

37:00.100 --> 37:00.600
Take it. Man.

37:00.700 --> 37:02.400
Call it a down payment on your next house.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.700
Wherever that may be.

37:07.400 --> 37:09.700
Hope you find a safe place.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.500
I thought it was here.

37:39.400 --> 37:40.900
Is my dad going to be all right?

37:41.000 --> 37:42.500
Well. He's going to be in intensive care for a while.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.500
But the transplant. It went well.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.500
Your dad's a hero.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.400
I'm going to tell him that when he wakes up.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.400
If you have something to say.

37:58.500 --> 37:59.600
Now would be a good time.

37:59.700 --> 38:00.800
You know what?

38:00.900 --> 38:02.500
You want to hand out keys like they're junk mail.

38:02.600 --> 38:03.200
You be my guest.

38:03.300 --> 38:06.500
That woman will play to 20.000 people every night.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.000
Wearing our insignia. Promoting our image.

38:09.100 --> 38:10.200
Image?

38:10.300 --> 38:14.200
How does nailing your
secretary help our image. Jordan?

38:14.300 --> 38:15.200
I'm not perfect.

38:15.300 --> 38:16.900
I never pretended...

38:16.935 --> 38:18.500
I don't need perfection!

38:18.600 --> 38:22.900
I just want you to stop giving me reason
to think of you as some kind of hypocrite.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.200
When you're running this place. Shawn.

38:25.300 --> 38:27.200
You can behave as nobly as you'd like.

38:27.300 --> 38:28.200
Meaning what?

38:28.300 --> 38:32.000
Meaning one day all of this will be yours.

38:32.100 --> 38:33.000
The paperwork's been drawn up.

38:33.100 --> 38:34.800
The lawyers know what to do.

38:34.900 --> 38:37.100
Everything's in place.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.700
But you're not going anywhere?

38:39.800 --> 38:41.900
Nevertheless.

38:42.000 --> 38:48.566
I sleep better knowing my life's
work is in the hands of the saintly.

38:48.601 --> 38:52.600
The unsullied shawn farrell.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.600
So we thought we had a cure
for the worid's obesity problems.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.200
Yeah. And instead.
We've got two dead bodies.

39:05.300 --> 39:06.500
A hundred other people in recovery.

39:06.600 --> 39:09.200
And one corporation scrambling to cover its ass.

39:09.300 --> 39:11.800
It looks like the great 4400 gold rush is over.

39:11.900 --> 39:14.900
Making the point of this little exercise what. Exactly?

39:15.000 --> 39:16.300
Well. Maybe they got it wrong.

39:16.400 --> 39:18.600
They thought they had a cure. But they didn't.

39:18.700 --> 39:19.700
I mean. They're from the future.

39:19.800 --> 39:21.300
But they're still human beings. Right?

39:21.400 --> 39:23.000
Let's not rush to judgment.

39:23.100 --> 39:26.400
We know rapid weight loss is
the effect on the human body.

39:26.500 --> 39:29.600
But if the purpose of this protein is
to provoke metabolic chemical change.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.900
It could have other applications.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.500
Like.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.200
I don't know... breaking down toxic waste.

39:35.300 --> 39:37.000
It could rid the ocean of pollutants.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.700
Maybe even restore in the ozone layer.

39:39.800 --> 39:40.600
So in other words.

39:40.700 --> 39:43.300
The possibilities are pretty much endless.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.433
That's all they are right now though

39:45.434 --> 39:46.339
possibilities.

39:46.374 --> 39:48.300
I mean we're years away from practical use.

39:48.400 --> 39:49.300
But with his new liver.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.800
Appelbaum won't be able to produce the chemical anymore.

39:51.900 --> 39:52.800
He doesn't have to.

39:52.900 --> 39:54.000
Now that we've got it isolated.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.500
We can reproduce it and
find out what we've really got here.

39:56.600 --> 39:59.700
So trent earned his golden parachute after all.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.300
Maybe his daughter can study chemistry in college.

40:13.400 --> 40:14.900
Hey.

40:15.700 --> 40:16.900
All right.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.300
There won't be any interruptions on my end.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.200
Is this a good time to talk?

40:22.300 --> 40:23.700
Yeah.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.000
Okay.

40:27.100 --> 40:28.400
Um.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.100
Here to say thanks.

40:33.700 --> 40:35.900
For getting me off the hook with the cops.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.100
Look kyle.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.700
I know you're going to make mistakes.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.800
I did when I was your age.

40:41.900 --> 40:46.400
The only thing I ask is you
let me help you learn from them.

40:46.500 --> 40:48.200
Makes sense.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.500
So I just need to know.

40:54.200 --> 40:57.800
You told me everything that
happened that night. Right?

41:06.600 --> 41:08.000
Yeah.

41:09.305 --> 41:15.537
