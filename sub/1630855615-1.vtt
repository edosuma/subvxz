Woman on radio:
Megan, return to base.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.672
Incoming
greet in one hour.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.591
Copy, traveling.

(engine revving)

(chuckling)

01:18.286 --> 01:20.497
Man:
Can you believe this?

01:20.538 --> 01:22.207
That's a giraffe.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.751
That's a real
giraffe right there.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.252
(camera shutter clicking)

01:26.294 --> 01:27.504
Wow.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.095
This one here.

01:35.136 --> 01:37.222
- You good with everything?
- Yeah.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.723
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.018
Hello, Tim!

01:42.060 --> 01:43.228
- Yes.
- Yes!

01:43.269 --> 01:45.480
Welcome to Ukubuyela Endle.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.690
And... yes,

01:46.731 --> 01:49.109
we do offer traditional
handshaking classes.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.403
- (chuckling)
- I'll have to work on that.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.822
Nozizwe, it's great to
finally meet you in person.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.573
Everybody calls me Mom Nozi.

01:55.615 --> 01:56.825
Okay, Mom Nozi.

01:56.866 --> 01:59.119
Well, this is Darius Pacheco -

01:59.160 --> 02:00.620
the videographer
and my right hand man.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.664
Hi, Mom.

02:02.706 --> 02:06.710
Ahh. Now, that's how you do it.
Where are you from?

02:06.751 --> 02:08.544
Cape Town, but I've been in
the US the past few years,

02:08.586 --> 02:09.963
working with Tim.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.132
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.883
Now, let's get you
inside out of this heat.

02:13.925 --> 02:14.968
I'm gonna finish up here.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.052
All right.
Cool.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.345
I'll take you
to your reception.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.680
Yeah.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.308
Oh?

02:23.351 --> 02:24.602
- Hi.
- Both: Hi.

02:24.644 --> 02:25.729
Mr. and Mrs. Foster.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.480
Yes.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.065
I'm Megan Henry.
I'll be your ranger tomorrow.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.358
- Mrs. Foster: Oh.
- Mr. Foster: Thank you.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.818
Why don't we meet back here
tomorrow morning?

02:31.860 --> 02:33.778
Is 6:30 too early?

02:33.820 --> 02:35.321
No, that'll be great.

02:35.363 --> 02:36.698
Okay, great.
Have a wonderful rest.

02:36.740 --> 02:37.824
Thank you.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.701
Nice to meet you.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.537
Oh, wow.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.623
This is beautiful.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.584
Thank you.
We're very proud of it.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.920
Ukubuyela Endle means
"A return to the wild."

02:50.962 --> 02:52.630
Well, I can't thank you enough

02:52.672 --> 02:55.467
for letting us use your reserve
for our little project.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.885
Little?

02:56.926 --> 02:59.220
I've seen the presentation
on your theme park ride.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.848
It'll be like people are
on actual safari.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.142
And they'll find out that it was
sponsored by Ukubuyela Endle

03:04.184 --> 03:06.186
and want to come and
experience the real thing.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.812
I believe they
call that synergy.

03:07.854 --> 03:08.980
Yes, they do.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.357
I've organized a ranger
for tomorrow,

03:10.398 --> 03:11.941
so you can get
started straight away.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.902
You know what? I think I'm
going to stick around here,

03:13.943 --> 03:15.153
just get the lay of the land,

03:15.195 --> 03:17.614
relax a little bit,
take some photos.

03:17.655 --> 03:18.865
I'll see
if your room's ready.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.742
All right.
Thank you.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.579
(exhaling sharply)

03:24.621 --> 03:26.247
(chuckling)

03:33.213 --> 03:34.589
Oh!

03:34.631 --> 03:37.008
Oh, can I help you
with something?

03:37.050 --> 03:39.719
I'm good, thank you.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.054
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.889
I'm just
checking out these photos.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.391
They're incredible.

03:44.432 --> 03:47.727
How do lions stay so
relaxed up in a tree like this?

03:47.769 --> 03:51.272
It's a good place for a nap and
a great place for a lookout.

03:51.314 --> 03:55.026
How about this one, too?
This cheetah is beautiful.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.194
Yeah, that's one
of my favorites.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.237
I took it last week.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.613
- You took this?
- Yeah.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.782
You're a talented
photographer.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.158
Thank you.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.910
Is there any way
that I can buy these?

04:03.952 --> 04:05.578
They're not really for sale,
but I could leave

04:05.620 --> 04:07.789
a few copies of them at
the front desk for you,

04:07.831 --> 04:09.082
if you want.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.959
That would be great.
Thank you.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.085
Who should I say they're for?

04:12.127 --> 04:14.421
Yeah, Tim Erickson.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.630
Megan Henry.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.591
- Nice to meet you, Megan.
- Yeah, you too.

04:19.634 --> 04:22.262
And you're sure I can't
help you with anything?

04:22.303 --> 04:24.514
- I got it. Thanks.
- Okay.

04:29.853 --> 04:30.979
Hey, Kamara.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.398
Hi.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.110
Wait. Did you take that apart
and then fix it again?

04:37.152 --> 04:38.695
Yeah, just needed
a little tweak.

04:38.737 --> 04:41.656
Wow. I have to give it to you,
you are pretty resourceful.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.783
Yeah, if I could just
figure out

04:43.825 --> 04:46.453
how to turn three weeks into
six months, I would be golden.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.872
I don't know how you do it -
working part-time

04:48.913 --> 04:52.417
and finishing your PhD;
it must all be so hard.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.336
Yeah, sometimes.

04:54.377 --> 04:57.714
But I am in South Africa,
living my dream, so...

04:57.756 --> 05:00.467
Oh, and when is your
thesis defense due again?

05:00.508 --> 05:02.802
(sighing)
It's due too soon.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.847
Okay. And then, what happens if
you don't finish it on time?

05:05.889 --> 05:07.974
I'm going to feed
myself to the lions.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.059
Wow!

05:09.100 --> 05:11.853
(both laughing)

05:11.895 --> 05:13.146
(sighing)

05:13.188 --> 05:14.606
Hey, do you want
to get dressed up

05:14.647 --> 05:15.899
and go to the Boma for dinner?

05:15.940 --> 05:17.150
What's the occasion?

05:17.192 --> 05:18.985
I don't feel like
doing my thesis.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.445
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.822
(both laughing)

05:22.864 --> 05:27.619
(drumming)

05:27.660 --> 05:30.747
*

05:30.789 --> 05:32.290
Amazing.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.001
(drumming)

05:35.043 --> 05:37.962
*

05:38.004 --> 05:39.506
(Megan laughing)

05:39.547 --> 05:41.174
Megan: He might be.
I don't know.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.009
Oh, good evening ladies.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.344
Both: Hi.

05:44.386 --> 05:45.845
Perfect timing
for an introduction.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.555
Tim, this is Dr. Henry.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.598
Nice to see you again.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.392
- You too.
- Doctor?

05:50.433 --> 05:52.018
She's working on it.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.854
This is my friend, Kamara.
She's one of the rangers here.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.065
Not yet.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.109
I'm working on it.
I'm a trainee.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.404
And I'm Darius.
I work with Tim.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.947
- Oh.
- Darius: Hi.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.532
Hi.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.703
So, how long
will you be staying?

06:09.744 --> 06:12.414
We'll be here
for three weeks.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.333
So, we'll definitely be
seeing each other again.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.460
Absolutely.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.297
Well, we will let you
enjoy your dinner.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.008
Have a good night.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.426
You, as well.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.303
- (chuckling)
- I'll leave you to it. Enjoy.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.222
Thank you.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.726
Wow.
Two very handsome guys.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.145
And here we are,
completely available.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.022
Oh, speak for yourself.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.274
I'm available for one thing
and that is work.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.234
Wow. Well, after
knowing you for three years,

06:41.276 --> 06:43.403
I think I have that
figured out.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.447
Are you calling me boring?

06:45.488 --> 06:48.033
No, never.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.076
I will have you know
I think about things

06:50.118 --> 06:52.787
other than work
all the time...

06:52.829 --> 06:54.706
sometimes.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.916
Okay, fine,
every once in a while.

06:59.919 --> 07:03.048
Maybe I do spend a little too
much time studying dung beetles.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.966
Yeah.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.724
Oh, morning, Shandor.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.395
Tim:
Morning.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.272
Oh, hey.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.358
Wow, that's, um...

07:21.399 --> 07:24.194
That's a lot of great
equipment for a safari.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.570
Yeah,
you can never have too much.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.906
I agree. Besides, if you're
going out in the wild,

07:27.947 --> 07:29.491
you want to get as many
good photos as you can.

07:29.532 --> 07:33.286
As long as we get some
great video, we're good.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.622
Oh, are you filmmakers?

07:35.663 --> 07:37.248
- No, theme park designers.
- Oh.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.501
We're here getting some ideas
for our new attraction.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.294
Cool, like
a roller coaster or...?

07:41.336 --> 07:43.296
No, but I've done those.

07:43.338 --> 07:46.633
This is-- it's a little
more impressive.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.843
It's an immersive attraction,

07:48.885 --> 07:51.221
virtual reality, special
effects, robotic animals.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.473
So, all of this equipment

07:53.515 --> 07:55.475
just to make a
fake savanna and fake lions

07:55.517 --> 07:57.018
that jump out and go "roar".

07:57.060 --> 07:59.562
Do lions go "roar"?

07:59.604 --> 08:01.856
(chuckling)

08:01.898 --> 08:03.483
So, how long you been
a photographer?

08:03.525 --> 08:07.946
Well, my grandpa got me my first
camera when I was about four.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.365
I fancied myself pretty good
at taking pictures

08:10.407 --> 08:11.658
of people's noses,
and then, you know,

08:11.700 --> 08:13.243
every once in a while,
I'd catch an ear.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.577
Well, by the looks of it,

08:14.619 --> 08:16.413
from those pictures inside,

08:16.454 --> 08:17.831
you've improved
just a little bit.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.208
Thank you.
It's just a hobby.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.960
Oh, so, you're a ranger now?

08:22.002 --> 08:24.838
Yeah, but, um, in real life, I'm
actually a research scientist.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.089
Really?

08:26.131 --> 08:28.633
So, I guess you'd know
if a lion goes "rah"!

08:28.675 --> 08:30.593
Mmm. I would.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.888
Oh, morning.
You can get on in.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.057
I should get back to work,
but be careful out there.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.686
It looks pretty safe to me.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.063
Oh, yeah, I mean it
looks innocent enough.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.109
But you see that
field over there?

08:46.151 --> 08:47.986
Yesterday,
I was driving by

08:48.028 --> 08:51.865
and I spotted a pride
of 18 lions sleeping,

08:51.906 --> 08:53.783
completely
hidden in the grass.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.578
- Eighteen lions?
- Yeah.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.538
Are they here
at the lodge, too?

08:58.580 --> 09:00.540
Oh, yeah, they're free
to roam wherever they want.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.250
No fences?

09:02.292 --> 09:04.878
No fences, no nothing.
Have fun.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.088
(engine revving)

09:11.343 --> 09:14.471
Yeah, there's 18 lions over
there... Or there was.

09:14.512 --> 09:17.515
- There's fences, right?
- No, there's no fences.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.435
(animals grunting)

09:20.477 --> 09:23.646
(elephants trumpeting)

09:28.526 --> 09:31.738
Megan: The babies are trying to
cool themselves off with mud.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.449
Get some pictures.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.451
Beautiful, aren't they?

09:36.493 --> 09:38.578
Absolutely beautiful.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.455
(trumpeting)

09:40.497 --> 09:41.748
(buzzing)

09:41.790 --> 09:44.125
- Mr. Foster: What's that noise?
- What?

09:44.167 --> 09:49.047
(buzzing)

09:49.089 --> 09:51.758
(trumpeting)

09:52.967 --> 09:54.719
Kamara.
Come in, Kamara. Over.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.429
Kamara:
What's up?

09:56.471 --> 09:59.224
Hey, so, I just spotted a drone
flying low over the park.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.392
Can you check it out?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.018
Kamara:
10-4. I'm on it.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.353
Thank you.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.569
I think we're pretty
good here for now.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.613
Oh, it's absolutely fabulous.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.574
Megan:
It never gets old.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.202
(buzzing)

10:19.244 --> 10:20.328
What's that?

10:21.663 --> 10:24.457
(buzzing)

10:24.499 --> 10:26.668
See, this is
what I'm getting.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.129
Oh, yeah, check out that.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.756
- What's that?
- Hey, what are you doing?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.258
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.218
We're just checking to see
what's lurking in the bushes

10:35.260 --> 10:36.261
before we venture out.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.887
This drone is fantastic.

10:37.929 --> 10:41.141
I'm sure it is,
but you can't use it here.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.475
- Really?
- Really.

10:42.517 --> 10:43.977
What's the problem?

10:44.019 --> 10:46.146
Well, for starters,
it's illegal

10:46.187 --> 10:48.314
to use a drone in
a legislated protected area.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.191
So, if the authorities catch
you, they'll take your drone,

10:50.233 --> 10:51.776
and you'll be banned
from using the reserve.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.612
You're kidding, right?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.281
No.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.782
Well, how am I supposed
to get my job done?

10:57.824 --> 10:58.992
I need to use a drone.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.827
The old-fashioned way,
like everybody else.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.037
You get a ranger,
you drive around,

11:02.078 --> 11:03.496
see if you can
spot something.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.331
That doesn't sound
terribly efficient.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.709
Well, neither's
your drone,

11:07.751 --> 11:09.377
seeing as you're gonna
have to stop using it.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.589
You just-- you have something
against technology, right?

11:12.630 --> 11:14.132
No, but I do have
something against

11:14.174 --> 11:16.634
disturbing the animals
in the natural world.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.428
Personally,
I don't think a little drone

11:18.470 --> 11:19.679
is disturbing anything.

11:19.721 --> 11:20.847
It's a flying camera.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.224
Think of it as a bird.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.143
You can think of it
however you want,

11:25.185 --> 11:27.228
but you're going
to have to stop using it.

11:27.270 --> 11:28.688
I don't think
you're right about that.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.357
Would you prefer
I write you a ticket

11:30.398 --> 11:32.692
and give you
a fine right now?

11:32.734 --> 11:36.071
You don't have
the authority to do that.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.864
As a park ranger,
I do have the authority,

11:37.906 --> 11:39.574
and I'm afraid you're
going to have to deal with me.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.035
- You?
- Yeah, me.

11:42.077 --> 11:45.038
Darius, can you please
bring the drone in...

11:45.080 --> 11:46.498
now?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.750
- Tim?
- Bring the drone in.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.669
Darius:
All right.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.003
Thank you.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.464
Welcome.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.425
(buzzing)

12:00.845 --> 12:03.056
Okay, I'll see you later.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.308
Morning, Megan.
I was looking for you.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.518
I need a little favor.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.852
Anything for you.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.270
I was hoping you'd say that.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.855
I've changed your
guests for today.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.399
I put the Fosters
with Bandile.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.109
Okay, no problem.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.485
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.986
Okay.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.155
Tim:
Let's go see some wildlife.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.240
Darius: Oh, yeah.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.491
Tim!

12:21.533 --> 12:22.992
Megan!

12:24.411 --> 12:26.287
You know what? I think there
might have been a mistake.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.832
I'm just gonna go check
with Mom Nozi really quick.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.167
Uh, no, I spoke to Nozizwe

12:31.209 --> 12:32.877
and she told us to take
the vehicle

12:32.919 --> 12:34.671
that's in the driveway
at 7 a.m.

12:34.713 --> 12:37.674
It's 7 a.m. and...

12:37.716 --> 12:40.301
I don't
see any other vehicles.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.722
You don't have your
drone with you, do you?

12:43.763 --> 12:46.307
No, but I can go get it,
if you want me to.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.938
If you're all ready,
we can head out.

12:51.980 --> 12:55.775
Oh, and today,
we need to see some giraffes.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.987
Oh, okay, yeah. Giraffes.

12:59.029 --> 13:01.114
I'll just give them a call.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.658
How difficult
can it be to spot a giraffe?

13:03.700 --> 13:04.909
All ready to go?

13:04.951 --> 13:07.370
- Both: Yeah.
- To the giraffes.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.372
They're expecting us.

13:09.414 --> 13:10.915
(engine revving)

13:22.635 --> 13:24.554
Yeah, good luck
with that, man.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.765
There's like
zero signal out here.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.309
(sighing)
Well, this is great.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.853
I guess my safari attraction's
going to be

13:31.895 --> 13:33.980
a bunch of people looking out
over an empty Savannah,

13:34.022 --> 13:35.482
listening to weird sounds.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.150
Shh. Shh.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.110
(rustling)

13:45.075 --> 13:46.368
Darius! Darius! Crazy!

13:46.409 --> 13:48.912
Oh, wow.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.667
Look at that.

13:53.708 --> 13:56.795
Look at this.
(chuckling)

13:56.836 --> 13:59.005
Wow.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.843
How did you know
it was there?

14:03.885 --> 14:06.304
I know what to
listen and look for.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.264
You know,
the crazy thing is,

14:08.306 --> 14:10.767
you can be right beside them
and not even realize it.

14:10.809 --> 14:14.646
How? They're so big...
and beautiful.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.655
Do you want to follow her?

14:23.697 --> 14:24.614
- Yeah.
- Can we?

14:24.656 --> 14:25.782
Please?

14:25.824 --> 14:27.992
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Okay.

14:28.034 --> 14:31.287
(engine revving)

14:36.042 --> 14:38.044
Hey, Darius,
just give me a minute.

14:38.086 --> 14:40.672
- I'll catch up with you.
- Okay, cool.

14:40.714 --> 14:41.965
- Um...
- Yeah?

14:42.007 --> 14:44.509
I owe you a huge apology.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.261
I shouldn't have had
my drone out yesterday,

14:46.302 --> 14:48.221
and I did not take
being set straight very well.

14:48.263 --> 14:51.891
It's okay.
I'm sorry, too.

14:51.933 --> 14:53.810
I, uh-- I get
a little passionate

14:53.852 --> 14:55.478
when it comes
to the wildlife.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.230
Well, I appreciate passion.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.482
You don't have to be sorry.
It was all on me.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.817
Can we just...
(sighing)

15:00.859 --> 15:02.861
...put this
behind us and start fresh?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.321
Sure.
I would like that.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.073
Do you want to grab
a cold drink or something?

15:07.115 --> 15:09.993
I have a ton of work
I've got to get done.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.494
Everybody needs a break.

15:11.536 --> 15:14.122
Okay.
Yeah, sure.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.332
I just need
to go get changed.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.668
I can meet you
on the veranda in 20 minutes.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.211
Okay.

15:24.007 --> 15:26.009
(grunting)

15:27.510 --> 15:28.678
Hey.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.680
- Hey.
- Tim: Look at this.

15:30.722 --> 15:33.767
I know.
They come almost every day.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.810
Here you go.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.103
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.647
- Got you an iced tea.
- Oh. Thank you.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.363
Tim:
Oh, man.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.117
You could
be a professional.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.619
It's just part of my job.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.953
Which one?

15:53.995 --> 15:55.455
Research scientist?
Ranger?

15:55.497 --> 15:56.790
Photographer?

15:56.831 --> 15:58.792
Research.
I'm working on my thesis,

15:58.833 --> 16:01.961
so I need a ton of
photos to do my defense.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.463
Master's? PhD?

16:03.505 --> 16:04.881
PhD in Ethology.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.341
Ethology...

16:06.383 --> 16:07.842
Yeah, it's the study of
animal behavior.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.929
Like... Jane Goodall?

16:10.970 --> 16:14.641
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, she's one
of the greatest in our field.

16:14.683 --> 16:17.102
So, where did you study?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.978
Braxton University
in Pennsylvania.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.897
What made you come out here?

16:20.939 --> 16:24.567
The dream was always to come
here to do research for my PhD.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.111
So, you're an underachiever.

16:26.152 --> 16:29.364
- (chuckling)
- It's an expensive dream.

16:29.406 --> 16:32.158
Yeah, and it was one I couldn't
really afford, to be honest.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.993
But then, I heard about
this rangers program

16:34.035 --> 16:35.745
and it would allow me
to work part-time

16:35.787 --> 16:37.163
to pay for my expenses.

16:37.205 --> 16:39.499
So, four years ago,
I packed my bags,

16:39.541 --> 16:43.294
came out here, got my rangers
license, and here I am.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.671
So, you've been here
for four years?

16:44.713 --> 16:46.089
No, not altogether.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.091
The first two years,
I was here working as a ranger

16:48.133 --> 16:50.719
to get the money together
that I needed to do my PhD.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.138
And then, I went back to
Braxton to do all my courses.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.806
So, when did you come
back here?

16:54.848 --> 16:56.725
Five months ago
to do my research.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.352
And then, now, I've just been
working on my thesis defense,

16:59.394 --> 17:02.856
which needs to be accepted
before I get my PhD.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.983
When do you have
to have it completed by?

17:05.025 --> 17:06.276
Now-ish.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.861
- (chuckling)
- Yeah.

17:07.902 --> 17:10.696
I'm going back in a month
to get the presentation ready.

17:10.739 --> 17:12.656
Well, it seems like you
got it all figured out.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.784
Yeah, we'll see.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.243
I still have
a lot of research to do,

17:16.286 --> 17:17.996
and then, I have to
come up with a creative way

17:18.038 --> 17:19.164
to present my thesis defense.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.125
That...
that is the scary part.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.710
Wow, that's a lot of pressure.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.587
Yeah.

17:25.627 --> 17:30.258
Speaking of which, I really
should get back to work.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.093
Is it okay
if I walk with you?

17:32.135 --> 17:35.180
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.058
Tim: So, what exactly is
the research you're doing here?

17:38.099 --> 17:40.226
The big cats;
I study their population,

17:40.268 --> 17:42.979
their behavior,
their response to habitat loss.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.898
For what purposes?

17:44.939 --> 17:46.566
Conservation.

17:46.608 --> 17:49.861
A lot of the big cats are on
fast track to extinction, so...

17:49.903 --> 17:52.155
- That's unthinkable.
- Yeah.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.449
You know I admire you
sacrificing so much

17:54.491 --> 17:56.534
to come out here
and stick with it.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.371
Thanks.
I do it because I love it.

18:00.663 --> 18:03.375
Well, this is me.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.627
It's been really nice
talking with you.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.545
Yeah. Yeah, you too.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.255
And literally,
I did all the talking.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.466
I don't quite know
how that happened.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.094
I guess I'm
an inquisitive human.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.845
Yeah, well,
you'd make a good scientist.

18:15.887 --> 18:18.473
Oh, I don't know about that.
I don't have the patience.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.141
The good thing
about theme park design

18:20.183 --> 18:21.893
is that
I get to travel a lot.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.562
I finish one project, and I move
on to the next challenge.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.940
Hm. Do you like being
on the go all the time?

18:26.981 --> 18:30.235
Yeah. Yeah, I love it.
I'm here.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.445
If inspiration is
what you're looking for,

18:32.487 --> 18:34.656
you definitely came
to the right place.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.032
I'll see you tomorrow.

18:36.074 --> 18:38.910
See you tomorrow.

18:45.000 --> 18:54.968
*

19:09.232 --> 19:10.400
Darius:
Oh, Tim look at that.

19:10.442 --> 19:12.527
Tim:
So beautiful.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.781
(roaring)

19:16.823 --> 19:19.993
Darius: Oh, look at them go!
(chuckling)

19:21.119 --> 19:22.328
Tim: Wow.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.330
The wildebeest came in?

19:24.372 --> 19:25.915
- Megan: Mm-hmm.
- (Tim chuckling)

19:25.957 --> 19:28.460
Um, Tim, I want to see
if I can get a few shots

19:28.501 --> 19:29.544
of the warthogs and impalas.

19:29.586 --> 19:30.754
- Yeah?
- Tim: Yeah.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.172
So, I'll catch up
with you guys later.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.049
Sounds good.
See you in a bit.

19:36.384 --> 19:37.969
Everyone's meeting here now.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.471
Mm-hmm.
Hi.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.181
- How was lunch?
- Oh, perfect, as always.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.808
- Thank you.
- Excellent.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.935
I hope you're both coming to
the Boma for braai tonight.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.563
- Wouldn't miss it.
- See you at six.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.648
- Tim: Okay.
- Sounds good.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.401
What's a braai?

19:54.486 --> 19:56.279
(chuckling)
It's kind of like a barbecue.

19:56.321 --> 19:58.156
Well, count me in.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.661
Hey, would you be interested in
doing a short walking safari?

20:03.703 --> 20:05.205
Now? Here?

20:05.246 --> 20:07.374
- Yeah.
- What about the 18 Lions?

20:07.415 --> 20:10.710
Well, we have areas that are
cleared by our trackers,

20:10.752 --> 20:13.171
and we take the ranger trainees
out there all the time.

20:13.213 --> 20:16.633
Yet another job
to add to your resume.

20:16.675 --> 20:20.136
Yeah, well, we all
participate in training here.

20:20.178 --> 20:22.138
Mostly,
I just hang out with Kamara.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.723
Come on.

20:23.765 --> 20:24.891
Okay.

20:32.607 --> 20:35.985
This is what I envisioned
for the theme park.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.446
Imagine bringing this
experience to kids and families?

20:38.488 --> 20:41.491
I just got to figure out
how to make it happen.

20:41.533 --> 20:44.244
Oh, wow! Look at that.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.745
Oh, yeah, they're so cute
when they run.

20:45.787 --> 20:47.914
So cute.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.833
Well, I think it
all sounds very exciting.

20:49.874 --> 20:52.085
It's not as exciting
as what you do.

20:52.127 --> 20:56.047
What? You create.
Not everyone can do that.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.133
How did you get into it?

20:58.174 --> 21:01.386
For my tenth birthday, my
parents took me to Disney

21:01.428 --> 21:02.929
and it blew my mind.

21:02.971 --> 21:04.764
I came home that day and I said,
"I want to design something

21:04.806 --> 21:06.808
like that,
so I can go whenever I want."

21:06.850 --> 21:09.686
So, you went
to Penn State.

21:09.728 --> 21:11.730
Did you grow up
in Pennsylvania?

21:11.771 --> 21:14.024
No, no.
I grew up in upstate New York.

21:14.065 --> 21:15.191
Hm.

21:15.233 --> 21:17.485
- Where do you live?
- New York City.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.612
- New York City.
- Yeah, a long way from home.

21:19.654 --> 21:21.740
Must be exciting.
(chuckling)

21:21.781 --> 21:24.868
It is. It is. I love it.
I work for this great

21:24.909 --> 21:26.995
boutique agency called
Colvin Designs.

21:27.037 --> 21:28.621
Mm-hmm.

21:28.663 --> 21:30.331
It's the best job ever.

21:30.373 --> 21:32.208
Recently,
I'm working on this proposal

21:32.250 --> 21:33.793
for Chipperfield Theme Parks.

21:33.835 --> 21:35.462
They're one of the biggest
players in our industry.

21:35.503 --> 21:37.380
Oh, that's amazing.

21:37.422 --> 21:38.631
Yeah, if I get
this contract,

21:38.673 --> 21:42.177
it would be a huge step up
in my career.

21:42.218 --> 21:46.139
Now-- now, I'm the one that's
been talking the entire time.

21:46.181 --> 21:47.307
Sorry about that.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.934
It's okay,
I don't mind.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.020
I've liked hearing
more about you.

21:56.691 --> 22:00.403
Folks, are you ready for
tonight's entertainment?

22:00.445 --> 22:01.654
- Oh, yeah.
- Of course you are.

22:01.696 --> 22:03.990
- Oh, yeah.
- Drums, please.

22:04.032 --> 22:07.911
(drumming)

22:07.952 --> 22:12.999
(traditional
South African singing)

22:13.041 --> 22:23.009
*

22:24.302 --> 22:26.012
Who me?

22:26.054 --> 22:27.430
(drumming)

22:27.472 --> 22:36.815
*

22:37.691 --> 22:40.235
Oh, that was fun last night.

22:40.276 --> 22:41.861
It really was.

22:41.903 --> 22:43.697
Mom Nozi really knows
how to throw a party.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.365
And you were actually
having a good time.

22:45.407 --> 22:48.326
I've never seen
you laugh so much.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.913
(laughing) Okay, me?
What about you and Darius?

22:51.955 --> 22:53.665
Huh?
What's going on there?

22:53.707 --> 22:55.875
- He's cute, isn't he?
- Mm-hmm.

22:55.917 --> 23:00.672
And Tim, what a handsome guy.
He'd be perfect for you.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.298
Yeah, I've had
the "perfect-for-you" guy.

23:02.340 --> 23:03.883
It hasn't worked out
so well for me.

23:03.925 --> 23:05.885
So, I am going to stick with
my very faithful companion:

23:05.927 --> 23:07.220
work.

23:07.262 --> 23:09.723
Ah, work isn't the only thing
in life, you know?

23:09.764 --> 23:14.060
No, but right now,
getting my PhD kinda is.

23:14.102 --> 23:18.231
Okay. Too bad
because Tim is so handsome.

23:19.441 --> 23:20.984
Hmm.
I hadn't noticed.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.572
Oh, you're coming with me
to the school tomorrow, right?

23:25.613 --> 23:27.824
Oh, yeah, of course.
I wouldn't miss it.

23:27.866 --> 23:31.995
Um, why don't we invite
Tim and Darius?

23:33.246 --> 23:34.748
I don't know.

23:34.789 --> 23:38.126
I mean, Tim's here to work on
his presentation and...

23:38.168 --> 23:41.921
Well, it's just that I'd like
to spend some time with Darius,

23:41.963 --> 23:45.258
and it would be awkward if I
invited him on his own.

23:49.346 --> 23:52.474
Okay, fine.
We will invite them.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.809
- (laughing)
- Ugh.

23:54.851 --> 24:02.901
*

24:02.942 --> 24:06.321
(singing in African language)

24:07.322 --> 24:17.332
*

24:20.335 --> 24:21.836
(audience applauding, cheering)

24:25.882 --> 24:27.634
Thank you for inviting us.

24:27.676 --> 24:29.260
Yeah, of course.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.970
You know, Kamara actually
went to school here.

24:31.012 --> 24:33.264
Her and Mom Nozi come and visit
the students every month.

24:33.306 --> 24:34.307
Really?

24:34.349 --> 24:35.558
So, what do you think?

24:35.600 --> 24:38.019
- It's amazing.
- Yeah.

24:38.061 --> 24:39.813
Megan said that you
went to school here.

24:39.854 --> 24:41.398
Yeah, well,
except, when I started,

24:41.439 --> 24:42.816
there was one small building.

24:42.857 --> 24:44.401
Mom Nozi made
all of this possible.

24:44.442 --> 24:46.695
Yeah, she raised all the money
using profits from the reserve.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.363
It's so great that
she's done so well

24:48.405 --> 24:50.532
and she's paying it forward.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.283
Did you want to meet
some of the students?

24:52.325 --> 24:54.661
- Yes, please.
- Yeah, please, let's do it.

24:54.703 --> 24:55.995
- This way.
- Okay.

24:56.037 --> 24:58.331
(drumming)

24:58.373 --> 25:02.627
*

25:02.669 --> 25:03.837
Oh.

25:06.923 --> 25:11.845
*

25:11.886 --> 25:13.138
Tim:
All right.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.098
Megan: Get in there.
(laughing)

25:15.140 --> 25:17.475
(drumming)

25:17.517 --> 25:19.728
*

25:19.769 --> 25:22.313
- Tim: I'm getting it?
- I'm losing my beat.

25:22.355 --> 25:25.358
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Tim: Shoulders, right?

25:25.400 --> 25:30.864
*

25:32.157 --> 25:34.534
Nozi:
Welcome to Ukubuyela Endle.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.536
Thank you.
I'm Amy Bradshaw.

25:36.578 --> 25:38.496
Miss Bradshaw, of course.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.540
We have one of
the best suites

25:40.582 --> 25:41.791
ready for you
in the Upper Lodge.

25:41.833 --> 25:43.710
- Oh, fantastic.
- Tim: That was incredible.

25:43.752 --> 25:45.045
Yeah,
I'm so glad you enjoyed it.

25:45.086 --> 25:46.379
Yeah.

25:46.421 --> 25:48.214
I think they're so sweet.

25:48.256 --> 25:50.592
Okay, Daddy,
I'll let you know how it goes.

25:50.633 --> 25:53.011
Yeah, sure. Talk soon.

25:53.053 --> 25:54.304
- Love you. Bye.
- Megan: I'm not even kidding.

25:54.346 --> 25:55.388
Tim!

25:55.430 --> 25:57.640
- Amy?
- Hi.

25:57.682 --> 25:59.559
- Hey.
- It's so good to see you.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.771
Wow.
Uh, yeah, it-- wow.

26:02.812 --> 26:04.898
- Wow.
- I'm so sorry.

26:04.939 --> 26:07.317
This is Megan Henry.
She's our ranger here.

26:07.359 --> 26:08.526
Oh, ranger. Hi. Amy.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.028
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

26:10.070 --> 26:11.154
Amy and I went
to school together.

26:11.196 --> 26:13.073
We went to the
same design college.

26:13.114 --> 26:14.449
Oh, very cool.

26:14.491 --> 26:15.867
Well, I hope you
enjoy your stay.

26:15.909 --> 26:18.161
I'm sure I will, thanks.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.122
What are you doing here?

26:21.164 --> 26:24.668
Oh, it's a long story.
We have so much to catch up on.

26:24.709 --> 26:26.628
But I am just
about to order lunch.

26:26.670 --> 26:28.046
Do you want to join me?

26:29.422 --> 26:31.091
Yeah... sure.

26:31.132 --> 26:32.676
Do we have enough time
before our next drive?

26:32.717 --> 26:34.219
Oh, yeah, yeah.
There's time. For sure.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.012
Why don't you two go ahead?
I'll catch up with you later.

26:36.054 --> 26:37.180
No, no.
You should join us.

26:37.222 --> 26:39.224
Oh, no.
I have so much I have to do.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.767
I should get back
to work anyway.

26:40.809 --> 26:42.268
- You sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.

26:42.310 --> 26:44.354
It was really nice
to meet you, Amy.

26:44.396 --> 26:45.438
- You too.
- Bye.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.357
Okay. See you in a bit.

26:47.399 --> 26:49.234
Megan:
Yeah.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.443
Looking good.

26:50.485 --> 26:53.321
Thank you.
So are you.

26:53.363 --> 26:54.406
What a coincidence...

26:54.447 --> 26:58.076
(conversation continuing
indistinctly)

27:03.373 --> 27:05.166
I cannot believe it's been ten
years since we saw each other.

27:05.208 --> 27:06.918
- Ten years...
- Since we graduated.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.045
I mean,
it's so great to see you again.

27:09.087 --> 27:11.589
You too.
So, are you here on vacation?

27:11.631 --> 27:14.050
No.
I am here for work.

27:14.092 --> 27:15.719
We're actually going
to be working together,

27:15.760 --> 27:18.054
at least I hope.

27:18.096 --> 27:20.056
You're working
for my company now?

27:20.098 --> 27:22.642
The thing is, Tim, my dad
just bought your company,

27:22.684 --> 27:25.186
Colvin Designs.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.189
So, um...

27:28.231 --> 27:29.566
Wow.
(chuckling nervously)

27:29.607 --> 27:31.901
Oh.

27:31.943 --> 27:34.821
And I am now running
the theme park division.

27:34.863 --> 27:37.365
So, does that mean
that you're my...

27:37.407 --> 27:38.408
- Boss.
- ...boss?

27:38.450 --> 27:39.659
Yes.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.828
- You're my boss.
- I am. So, I'm guessing--

27:41.870 --> 27:44.622
Um, I'm guessing you're
wondering why I am here.

27:44.664 --> 27:47.083
That's the burning question.

27:47.125 --> 27:48.835
I knew you'd be shocked
when you found out,

27:48.877 --> 27:50.420
so I thought it
would be best to come here

27:50.462 --> 27:52.505
and tell you in person,
especially since

27:52.547 --> 27:54.674
we've known each other
for so long, you know?

27:54.716 --> 27:56.301
Yeah, yeah.
Did you know that I was

27:56.343 --> 27:58.094
working for Colvin Designs
before the sale?

27:58.136 --> 28:01.306
No, not at all.
Imagine my surprise.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.392
Well, I appreciate you
coming all the way out here

28:04.434 --> 28:05.435
to let me know.

28:05.477 --> 28:07.145
Yes, of course.

28:07.187 --> 28:09.481
We have a lot of things to
look at with the new company,

28:09.522 --> 28:11.524
and I guess I just
wanted to check in with you

28:11.566 --> 28:14.694
to see if we could
work together, you know?

28:14.736 --> 28:16.529
Well, I'm sure we can.

28:16.571 --> 28:17.655
Yes?

28:17.697 --> 28:19.532
- Yeah.
- All right.

28:19.574 --> 28:21.076
You know,
why don't we go on a drive,

28:21.117 --> 28:22.452
so I can show you the world

28:22.494 --> 28:24.329
I'm planning to bring
into my new concept?

28:24.371 --> 28:25.789
- I would love that.
- Great.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.665
- Hi.
- Can I take your order?

28:27.707 --> 28:29.084
Amy:
Oh, wow.

28:29.125 --> 28:30.669
Tim:
Look at that.

28:30.710 --> 28:32.796
- It's a baby.
- They're so cute.

28:32.837 --> 28:35.340
Hey, Tim, why don't we get
a few shots of you out there?

28:35.382 --> 28:37.258
I mean, it'll be
great for publicity.

28:37.300 --> 28:38.635
Can you imagine the headline?

28:38.677 --> 28:41.054
"Theme park designer
walking with the elephants."

28:41.096 --> 28:42.305
I'm really sorry, Amy,

28:42.347 --> 28:43.765
but we're just a little
too close to do that.

28:43.807 --> 28:47.227
But why? They're so calm.
Everything looks so serene.

28:47.268 --> 28:49.604
I know it looks serene,
it's just really not safe.

28:49.646 --> 28:51.439
Oh, come on,
it'll be just for a minute.

28:51.481 --> 28:53.024
It doesn't really matter.
See the thing is,

28:53.066 --> 28:55.068
we have to remember is that this
is their world.

28:55.110 --> 28:56.820
We're simply visitors in it.

28:56.861 --> 28:59.322
As long as we respect their
space, they'll let us be here.

28:59.364 --> 29:01.991
Yeah, besides, we don't know
what's lurking out there.

29:02.033 --> 29:03.868
Elephants.

29:03.910 --> 29:07.122
And lions,
hyenas, leopards.

29:07.163 --> 29:10.542
Amy:
All right, let's move on then.

29:10.583 --> 29:11.584
Can we find a safer space?

29:11.626 --> 29:13.336
Yeah, sure.

29:13.378 --> 29:14.546
Tim:
Okay.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.089
- How's this?
- (camera shutter clicking)

29:16.131 --> 29:18.049
All right, that's lovely.

29:18.091 --> 29:20.010
Could you scootch
over to the left a little?

29:20.051 --> 29:22.345
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Cool.

29:22.387 --> 29:26.099
Amy: Couldn't you find anything
better for a backdrop, Darius?

29:26.141 --> 29:27.600
I mean, this is--

29:27.642 --> 29:31.104
this is gorgeous,
Amy, and you wanted safe.

29:31.146 --> 29:33.189
This is the best I
could do at a minute's notice.

29:33.231 --> 29:35.859
Yeah, but we should be standing
out in a field

29:35.900 --> 29:39.487
with zebras running
and lions roaring.

29:39.529 --> 29:41.781
I could have stayed home
and photoshopped these.

29:43.074 --> 29:45.410
Okay, I, uh...

29:45.452 --> 29:47.203
Well, why don't
I talk to Nozizwe

29:47.245 --> 29:48.621
and see if she can
suggest someplace better?

29:48.663 --> 29:50.457
I really need wildlife
in the background, Tim.

29:50.498 --> 29:53.043
I would even settle
for a cow at this point.

29:53.084 --> 29:54.878
They have cows here, right?

29:54.919 --> 29:57.172
Yeah, yeah,
I think they have cows here.

29:57.213 --> 30:00.050
Hey, uh,
you have a drone, right?

30:00.091 --> 30:02.177
- Yes, I do.
- Yeah, let's put it to work.

30:02.218 --> 30:03.678
You can't fly a drone here.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.889
- Says who?
- Megan.

30:05.930 --> 30:09.059
What a surprise.
(sighing)

30:09.100 --> 30:10.352
All right,
I'll have a chat with her.

30:10.393 --> 30:12.062
I'm sure we can
sort something out.

30:12.103 --> 30:13.396
Well, look,
why don't I talk to her

30:13.438 --> 30:15.315
and see if she can
take us out on another safari

30:15.357 --> 30:18.818
and find someplace safe
I can get out of the vehicle?

30:18.860 --> 30:20.737
- Sounds good.
- Tim: Okay.

30:20.779 --> 30:21.988
(grunting)

30:22.030 --> 30:23.615
Megan: Okay.

30:23.656 --> 30:27.702
You can get out, but I need you
to stay close to the vehicle.

30:27.744 --> 30:30.080
- Are you sure? They...
- (hippos grunting)

30:30.121 --> 30:31.915
They don't sound too happy.

30:31.956 --> 30:34.834
Well, it's daytime, so they'll
stay in or close to the river,

30:34.876 --> 30:37.921
and I'll keep an eye on them
in the clearing. Come on.

30:37.962 --> 30:41.216
So, Tim, why don't you run
a little closer to the bank,

30:41.257 --> 30:43.176
so Darius can get
a few good shots of you?

30:43.218 --> 30:45.929
Oh, no. No, I'm sorry.
We can't do that.

30:45.970 --> 30:48.181
But why not? You just said
that they stay in the river,

30:48.223 --> 30:49.391
and if something happens,

30:49.432 --> 30:51.184
then Tim can just run
back to the car.

30:51.226 --> 30:52.727
Well, how fast can they run?

30:52.769 --> 30:55.313
Well, they'll outrun you.

30:55.355 --> 30:58.024
I mean, they don't call them
a river horse for nothing.

30:58.066 --> 30:59.943
Yeah, I'd say it's
probably a pretty bad idea

30:59.984 --> 31:01.027
to go down there.

31:01.069 --> 31:02.987
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:03.029 --> 31:05.281
Did you bring
your drone with you?

31:05.323 --> 31:07.492
Darius: Yeah,
but you know we can't use it.

31:07.534 --> 31:09.411
Yeah, I know,
they're not permitted.

31:09.452 --> 31:10.870
But I mean,
we're in the middle of nowhere.

31:10.912 --> 31:11.955
Who's going to notice?

31:11.996 --> 31:15.959
Um... I'll notice.

31:16.001 --> 31:17.335
But we're all
friends here, right?

31:17.377 --> 31:19.587
Sure, yeah.
It's just, um, as a park ranger,

31:19.629 --> 31:23.133
it's my job to ensure that all
of the protocols are followed.

31:23.174 --> 31:25.969
Everyone breaks the rules,
Megan. Let's loosen up.

31:26.011 --> 31:27.303
Let's have
a bit of fun here.

31:27.345 --> 31:28.555
Amy, if you're
going to be out here,

31:28.596 --> 31:30.390
I need you to understand
one thing very clearly:

31:30.432 --> 31:34.310
poachers use drones to
find our rhinos and elephants,

31:34.352 --> 31:37.814
so they will not be tolerated
under any circumstances.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.900
Okay.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.318
Thanks.

31:46.281 --> 31:47.782
I knew I'd find you here.

31:47.824 --> 31:50.243
Oh. Hey.

31:55.331 --> 31:58.335
Um, I just...

31:58.376 --> 32:00.337
I wanted to say
I'm sorry about yesterday.

32:00.378 --> 32:02.130
I appreciate you
taking us out,

32:02.172 --> 32:04.341
and I know how busy you are.

32:04.382 --> 32:05.508
It's no problem.

32:05.550 --> 32:07.677
I just don't know
how helpful it was.

32:07.719 --> 32:09.262
It was great.

32:10.221 --> 32:12.182
Is Amy settling in okay?

32:12.223 --> 32:14.684
Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

32:14.726 --> 32:16.603
Good.

32:16.644 --> 32:19.022
You know you're a lucky guy;
not many people have a friend

32:19.064 --> 32:22.025
who would travel halfway around
the world just to visit them.

32:22.067 --> 32:23.777
I guess so.

32:23.818 --> 32:26.029
So, you guys have been
friends for a long time?

32:26.071 --> 32:30.033
Well, outside of
going to college together,

32:30.075 --> 32:32.619
we dated for a few months.

32:32.660 --> 32:35.538
That was like
ten years ago.

32:35.580 --> 32:39.167
I haven't seen her since
or even really kept in touch.

32:39.209 --> 32:42.796
So - sorry, I don't mean
to sound intrusive -

32:42.837 --> 32:46.049
but... why is she here?

32:46.091 --> 32:48.176
Her dad...

32:48.218 --> 32:51.179
just bought Colvin's.

32:51.221 --> 32:53.348
Oh.
Wow.

32:53.390 --> 32:55.141
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:55.183 --> 32:56.810
What does
that mean for you?

32:56.851 --> 33:00.772
Amy is now running
the theme park design division,

33:00.814 --> 33:03.191
so...

33:03.233 --> 33:05.193
she's effectively
my new boss.

33:05.235 --> 33:06.528
Wow.

33:08.571 --> 33:11.950
So, what's more stressful,

33:11.991 --> 33:14.327
being a ranger
or doing research?

33:14.369 --> 33:15.954
Oh, research, hands-down.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.497
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:17.539 --> 33:21.626
I mean, it's...
nothing I can control.

33:21.668 --> 33:25.296
I mean, I still want to do some
more research on the leopards.

33:25.338 --> 33:27.048
And then, there's
this pride of white lions

33:27.090 --> 33:29.884
that I was following, but
they've been so elusive lately.

33:29.926 --> 33:33.304
I've never seen a leopard
and white lions.

33:33.346 --> 33:34.973
They're really rare.

33:35.015 --> 33:37.434
There's only about a dozen
of them left in the wild.

33:37.475 --> 33:41.688
What I wouldn't give to
a white lion... and a leopard.

33:41.730 --> 33:43.606
Well...

33:43.648 --> 33:45.358
one of our trackers
just spotted a leopard

33:45.400 --> 33:47.068
and her cubs
down by the river,

33:47.110 --> 33:48.361
and Kamara and I
were planning on going

33:48.403 --> 33:50.196
to see if we could spot her.

33:50.238 --> 33:53.742
If you and Amy wanted to come,
you're welcome.

33:53.783 --> 33:55.994
Amy's got
video calls this morning,

33:56.036 --> 33:57.454
but I'd love to come.

33:57.495 --> 34:00.707
Okay.
Meet you in the front in ten?

34:00.749 --> 34:02.334
Yeah, I just have to
put my stuff in my room.

34:02.375 --> 34:03.835
Yeah, okay.

34:13.011 --> 34:15.388
(screeching)

34:15.429 --> 34:17.806
(chittering)

34:17.849 --> 34:19.809
- Hear those alarm calls?
- Yeah, what is it?

34:19.851 --> 34:21.936
It's guinea fowl and baboon.
They know that she's here.

34:21.978 --> 34:26.440
(screeching)

34:26.483 --> 34:27.942
Where do you think she is?

34:27.984 --> 34:30.362
I would say she's about
a hundred yards away

34:30.402 --> 34:31.780
in that brush up there.

34:31.821 --> 34:34.157
That's where the trackers
last spotted her.

34:34.199 --> 34:36.201
Tim:
Wait a second.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.994
Oh! I see her!

34:38.036 --> 34:39.496
Megan:
Really?

34:39.536 --> 34:41.915
Yeah, yeah. Just to the right.
To the right of the bush.

34:41.956 --> 34:43.958
- Okay.
- Darius, you getting this?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.043
Yes, man.
I'm getting it.

34:46.085 --> 34:47.795
- (animals screeching)
- Megan: Nice work.

34:47.837 --> 34:50.465
That's her.
You know what?

34:50.507 --> 34:52.050
There's-- there's actually
a road up ahead.

34:52.092 --> 34:54.010
If we head over there, we might
be able to get a better view.

34:54.052 --> 34:55.679
- Yeah.
- Yes.

34:58.098 --> 34:59.641
(air hissing)

34:59.683 --> 35:01.643
What was that?

35:01.685 --> 35:04.354
A... flat tire.

35:04.396 --> 35:06.648
- Hmm.
- What do we do now?

35:06.690 --> 35:09.192
Well, we'll just have to
call road service and, uh...

35:09.234 --> 35:12.946
if they can't come,
then we'll grab a cab.

35:14.072 --> 35:15.949
You don't have
those out here, do you?

35:15.990 --> 35:19.994
No.
No, we don't even have service.

35:20.036 --> 35:21.830
All right,
everybody out, let's go.

35:21.871 --> 35:24.082
Darius: Whoa, whoa, hold on.
Wait, you're kidding, right?

35:24.124 --> 35:25.959
I mean,
there's a leopard out there.

35:26.001 --> 35:28.211
- Yeah.
- Megan: Yeah, and your job

35:28.253 --> 35:30.672
is to make sure she
doesn't come over here.

35:30.714 --> 35:32.215
Tim:
How do we...

35:32.257 --> 35:33.925
Here.

35:33.967 --> 35:36.469
What am I supposed
to do with this? Defend myself?

35:38.722 --> 35:40.598
If she does
come over this way,

35:40.640 --> 35:44.561
just, whatever you do,
don't run.

35:44.602 --> 35:46.229
Megan, you're kidding,
right?

35:46.271 --> 35:47.814
Uh-uh. Out.

35:47.856 --> 35:48.940
She's kidding, right?

35:48.982 --> 35:50.191
No, she's not kidding.

35:50.233 --> 35:51.693
(clearing throat)
Let's go. Let's do this.

35:51.735 --> 35:56.406
(animals screeching)

36:01.745 --> 36:05.582
(animals chittering)

36:05.623 --> 36:07.751
We should not be out here.

36:16.259 --> 36:17.927
Just...
There's a leopard over there.

36:17.969 --> 36:19.971
Stop holding onto me, man.

36:20.013 --> 36:22.223
- Okay, looks like we're done.
- Yeah.

36:27.187 --> 36:28.855
(Tim sighing)

36:28.897 --> 36:32.317
You okay?
You look a little pale.

36:32.359 --> 36:33.568
I'm good. I'm cool.

36:33.610 --> 36:35.737
- Megan: Mm-hmm.
- Tim: Let's go.

36:35.779 --> 36:37.197
All right,
you know, we're just, uh,

36:37.238 --> 36:39.657
not completely
out of the woods yet.

36:39.699 --> 36:41.826
That's a bad joke.

36:41.868 --> 36:44.204
Thank you very much, yeah.

36:44.245 --> 36:45.997
Uh, we're gonna
head back to the lodge.

36:46.039 --> 36:47.248
- Megan: Okay.
- Yeah.

36:57.967 --> 36:59.135
Wow.

36:59.177 --> 37:01.805
Doesn't get much
better than this.

37:10.563 --> 37:12.732
(phone ringing, vibrating)

37:12.774 --> 37:14.609
Hey, Ames.
It's good to hear from you.

37:14.651 --> 37:16.152
Have you settled in?

37:16.194 --> 37:18.655
Amy:
I'm doing okay, Daddy.

37:18.697 --> 37:20.699
- Just a few little issues.
- Oh, what's up?

37:20.740 --> 37:23.910
I'm not getting to spend as much
time with Tim as I'd hoped.

37:23.952 --> 37:25.662
Why?
What's the problem?

37:25.704 --> 37:27.163
He seems more
interested in spending time

37:27.205 --> 37:28.790
with a certain
ranger over here.

37:28.832 --> 37:30.250
Well, don't let that
get in your way.

37:30.291 --> 37:31.793
I mean, you've been
friends for years;

37:31.835 --> 37:33.294
that should count
for something.

37:33.336 --> 37:34.796
Yeah, I'm working on it.

37:34.838 --> 37:36.631
He's your
best asset going forward.

37:36.673 --> 37:38.174
So, you better lock him down

37:38.216 --> 37:41.136
before one of our competitors
comes in and snaps him up.

37:41.177 --> 37:42.971
Yeah, I know.
Working on it.

37:43.013 --> 37:45.306
And getting that
Chipperfield contract right now

37:45.348 --> 37:46.683
is a priority,

37:46.725 --> 37:48.309
and you know it's not going
to happen without Tim.

37:48.351 --> 37:49.811
Yeah, I know.

37:49.853 --> 37:52.272
All right,
we'll-- we'll talk again soon.

37:52.313 --> 37:53.898
I'll check-in. Bye.

37:57.986 --> 38:00.613
Do you want
to get out?

38:00.655 --> 38:03.033
There's no leopards,
is there?

38:03.074 --> 38:04.993
I mean, there might be,

38:05.035 --> 38:07.370
but it's one of our
walking safari locations.

38:07.412 --> 38:09.706
Don't worry,
you're safe with me. Come on.

38:09.748 --> 38:11.875
Okay.

38:16.796 --> 38:17.797
Wow.

38:17.839 --> 38:19.424
Pretty cool, huh?

38:19.466 --> 38:22.677
You know, I admire what you do;
give your all for this.

38:22.719 --> 38:25.055
Do you find any time
for a personal life?

38:25.096 --> 38:28.099
This is my personal life.

38:28.141 --> 38:29.809
But do you miss
going out with friends,

38:29.851 --> 38:33.021
hanging out, having fun,
being spontaneous?

38:33.063 --> 38:35.273
I'm sorry, is changing
a tire beside a leopard

38:35.315 --> 38:37.484
not spontaneous enough
for you?

38:37.525 --> 38:38.777
(elephant trumpeting)

38:38.818 --> 38:40.695
That's a good point.

38:40.737 --> 38:42.655
Thank you.

38:42.697 --> 38:45.033
Look at them.
Wow, they're beautiful.

38:45.075 --> 38:48.661
- Megan: Yeah, they are.
- (trumpeting)

38:48.703 --> 38:50.872
I haven't seen many two-legged
eligible bachelors around.

38:50.914 --> 38:53.667
You never know, I might
find one hiding up a tree.

38:53.708 --> 38:56.294
Seriously, though.

38:56.336 --> 39:00.048
I dated someone
for three years in college.

39:00.090 --> 39:02.509
We... got engaged.

39:02.550 --> 39:05.220
And when we graduated, we
planned on traveling the world,

39:05.261 --> 39:09.557
doing our research,
starting a family.

39:09.599 --> 39:10.934
And then?

39:11.810 --> 39:12.977
Uh...

39:13.019 --> 39:16.106
then, he changed his mind.

39:17.607 --> 39:18.983
Yeah, we--

39:19.025 --> 39:21.027
we spent some time apart
to figure some things out.

39:21.069 --> 39:22.904
I came out here, and while
I was gone, he met someone else.

39:22.946 --> 39:24.948
So, it ended.

39:24.989 --> 39:28.493
I spent a little
too much time crying over it.

39:28.535 --> 39:31.788
And then, decided I should
just get on with my life.

39:31.830 --> 39:34.082
That was it for love?

39:34.124 --> 39:35.917
Pretty much.
I mean I've dated a bit.

39:35.959 --> 39:37.502
I just... I don't know,

39:37.544 --> 39:39.295
I don't see the point
in pursuing something

39:39.337 --> 39:41.256
if it's just not
gonna go anywhere.

39:41.297 --> 39:46.219
Well, what if you unexpectedly
met someone and fell in love?

39:47.345 --> 39:49.973
The timing would
have to be right.

39:52.475 --> 39:53.768
What about you?

39:53.810 --> 39:55.895
I haven't-- no,

39:55.937 --> 39:59.983
I have nobody special
in my life, either.

40:02.193 --> 40:05.947
I dated someone on and off
for a couple years,

40:05.989 --> 40:10.243
but work got in the way,
we drifted apart,

40:10.285 --> 40:12.787
we split up
about a year ago.

40:12.829 --> 40:15.832
So, not a relationship guy?

40:15.874 --> 40:18.793
No, actually,
quite the opposite.

40:18.835 --> 40:20.587
I'd like to find love.

40:22.505 --> 40:26.676
It's just work seems
to always get in the way.

40:27.927 --> 40:29.929
Yeah, I get that.

40:29.971 --> 40:33.266
Sometimes,
work just has to come first.

40:34.184 --> 40:36.311
Yeah, or maybe
we just work so much

40:36.353 --> 40:38.480
because we haven't
found the right person yet.

40:40.398 --> 40:41.524
Yeah, maybe.

40:41.566 --> 40:43.234
(elephant trumpeting)

40:47.697 --> 40:50.200
(grunting)

40:50.241 --> 40:52.619
Amy: Oh, look at all these
magnificent animals.

40:52.660 --> 40:54.662
Yeah.

40:54.704 --> 40:56.498
It's such a missed
opportunity to use that drone,

40:56.539 --> 40:58.708
don't you think?

40:58.750 --> 41:00.919
I guess so.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.671
You know,
I don't understand

41:02.712 --> 41:05.882
why Megan is being such
a stickler for rules.

41:05.924 --> 41:07.842
I'm sure lots of people
send their drones up

41:07.884 --> 41:08.968
and no one really cares.

41:09.010 --> 41:10.887
You just have to be careful.

41:10.929 --> 41:13.682
Look, Amy,
I'm just here to do my job.

41:13.723 --> 41:15.809
Oh, yes, of course,
of course.

41:15.850 --> 41:17.519
Yeah. Can I?

41:17.560 --> 41:18.728
Ah. Look.

41:20.605 --> 41:21.773
Oh!

41:21.815 --> 41:24.192
- These are amazing, Darius.
- Yeah?

41:24.234 --> 41:26.361
- Hey, can you send them to me?
- Of course.

41:26.403 --> 41:29.364
Yeah, I'll make sure they get
into the hands of the CEO.

41:29.406 --> 41:32.409
As a matter of fact, I can just
introduce you when we get back.

41:32.450 --> 41:34.077
- No way.
- Yeah, of course.

41:34.119 --> 41:35.704
That would be great, Amy.
Thank you.

41:35.745 --> 41:37.580
I mean, you're part of
the family-- well, company.

41:37.622 --> 41:38.623
You know what I mean.

41:38.665 --> 41:40.291
- I get you.
- Yeah.

41:40.333 --> 41:42.877
Honestly, I must say,
that's really good to hear.

41:42.919 --> 41:45.797
I wasn't sure what was going
to happen after the sale.

41:45.839 --> 41:47.424
Don't worry,
I got your back.

41:47.465 --> 41:48.758
Thank you.

41:50.218 --> 41:53.888
Such a shame that
we can't use the drone.

41:53.930 --> 41:57.183
Can you imagine how impressed
head office would be if we did?

41:57.225 --> 42:01.146
Just picture elephants,
giraffes, lions, cheetahs,

42:01.187 --> 42:03.523
leopards, all roaming
across the savannah.

42:03.565 --> 42:07.110
But I guess
it is what it is.

42:08.069 --> 42:10.113
All right,
see you later.

42:13.867 --> 42:16.161
- (animals chittering)
- (camera shutter clicking)

42:16.202 --> 42:19.873
(camera shutter clicking)

42:19.914 --> 42:21.082
(roaring)

42:21.124 --> 42:23.001
(camera shutter clicking)

42:23.043 --> 42:24.461
(beeping)

42:24.502 --> 42:28.214
Oh, great,
not working again.

42:28.256 --> 42:31.509
What happened?
Is that your only camera?

42:31.551 --> 42:34.179
I know it's a dinosaur,
but it's served me well.

42:34.220 --> 42:37.098
Well, you can use my camera.

42:37.140 --> 42:40.518
It's brand-new.
The latest in technology.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.771
I know how much
you love that.

42:44.773 --> 42:46.608
Here, let me get a picture
of you with the cheetah.

42:46.649 --> 42:49.069
- Okay.
- Okay.

42:49.110 --> 42:51.196
(camera shutter clicking)

42:51.237 --> 42:53.156
What do you think?

42:56.159 --> 42:57.494
That's great.

42:57.535 --> 43:01.915
We should probably
get back before it gets dark.

43:04.084 --> 43:06.878
I'm sure it gets pretty
scary out here at night.

43:06.920 --> 43:10.423
Yeah, but it's really
beautiful with the stars.

43:19.891 --> 43:21.184
- (thudding)
- (gasping)

43:24.646 --> 43:26.564
(both gasping)

43:26.606 --> 43:28.692
(growling)

43:38.284 --> 43:40.578
How didn't you get scared?

43:40.620 --> 43:43.164
Part of the job.

43:43.206 --> 43:46.459
We should, um-- we should
head back for dinner.

43:46.501 --> 43:47.919
Yeah.

43:47.961 --> 43:50.672
Wow.
That was amazing.

43:52.465 --> 43:56.177
I would like to make
a toast to Mom Nozi

43:56.219 --> 43:59.055
for being the reason
that we are all here,

43:59.097 --> 44:02.600
and to the beautiful friendships
that we've made this week.

44:02.642 --> 44:07.022
But most importantly,
to my friend Kamara

44:07.063 --> 44:09.774
because, tonight,

44:09.816 --> 44:13.528
Mom Nozi has officially
certified you as a park ranger.

44:13.570 --> 44:15.822
Congratulations.

44:15.864 --> 44:17.991
Congrats.

44:18.033 --> 44:19.409
(chuckling)

44:19.451 --> 44:21.786
Cheers.

44:21.828 --> 44:24.789
Kamara: Oh...
Oh, wow.

44:24.831 --> 44:26.750
- Megan: You deserve it, Kamara.
- Kamara: Wow.

44:26.791 --> 44:27.959
Thank you.

44:29.419 --> 44:32.464
I would also
like to make a toast.

44:32.505 --> 44:36.051
I came here to get
inspiration for my work.

44:36.092 --> 44:37.886
I got so much more than that.

44:37.927 --> 44:39.554
Thanks, Megan.

44:39.596 --> 44:42.307
Thanks for giving us
a safari experience

44:42.349 --> 44:44.142
that we will never forget.

44:44.184 --> 44:45.977
Darius:
Indeed.

44:46.019 --> 44:47.354
- Cheers, Megan.
- Kamara: To Megan.

44:47.395 --> 44:48.605
- Darius: Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

44:48.646 --> 44:50.273
Tim: Cheers.

45:02.077 --> 45:06.915
(guitar playing softly)

45:08.875 --> 45:09.918
(all laughing)

45:09.959 --> 45:11.419
No, it was crazy.

45:11.461 --> 45:13.129
Oh, it sounds like you
guys had an awesome day.

45:13.171 --> 45:14.631
We did.

45:14.673 --> 45:16.091
Maybe next time
you can come with us.

45:16.132 --> 45:18.510
Yeah, maybe I will.

45:18.551 --> 45:20.011
Who wants an a nightcap?

45:20.053 --> 45:22.013
Uh, not for me.

45:22.055 --> 45:24.933
You know what? I'll have one.
Whatever you're having.

45:24.974 --> 45:26.810
Tim:
Okay.

45:30.563 --> 45:32.857
Sure is a charmer,
isn't he?

45:32.899 --> 45:34.109
Sorry?

45:34.150 --> 45:35.527
Oh, look at that smile.

45:35.568 --> 45:37.362
Come on, don't tell me
you haven't noticed.

45:37.404 --> 45:39.864
He's having fun here, Megan,

45:39.906 --> 45:41.533
and with you.

45:41.574 --> 45:43.118
It's part of the job

45:43.159 --> 45:45.829
to make sure everyone has
the best safari experience.

45:45.870 --> 45:46.830
Yeah.

45:47.747 --> 45:50.417
You know we dated, right?

45:50.458 --> 45:52.711
Yeah.
Yeah, he mentioned.

45:52.752 --> 45:54.129
Sometimes still wonder

45:54.170 --> 45:57.507
what would have happened
if we'd stuck it out.

45:57.549 --> 46:00.677
All right,
here we are.

46:00.719 --> 46:02.887
All right,
well, I am heading out.

46:02.929 --> 46:06.057
We have a big day tomorrow.
All work, no distractions

46:06.099 --> 46:08.560
because he's all mine
for the next few days.

46:08.601 --> 46:10.228
No cheetahs, I promise.

46:10.270 --> 46:12.731
We're just going to a hyena den,
full of hyena pups.

46:12.772 --> 46:13.898
- Hyena pups?
- Megan: Yeah.

46:13.940 --> 46:16.735
See you at seven
for breakfast.

46:16.776 --> 46:19.612
I'll be there. Doesn't sound as
fun as hyena pups, though.

46:21.031 --> 46:22.157
Goodnight, Megan.

46:22.198 --> 46:24.200
Goodnight, Amy.
Good luck with your work.

46:24.242 --> 46:26.327
Yeah, thank you.

46:26.369 --> 46:29.539
Tim: Yeah, I can't believe
that day that we had.

46:29.581 --> 46:30.874
- I know.
- Honestly.

46:30.915 --> 46:33.126
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

46:34.461 --> 46:36.296
Hyena pups.

46:36.338 --> 46:37.756
Megan:
So cute.

46:38.923 --> 46:40.300
I looked at your
design yesterday

46:40.342 --> 46:41.968
and I thought it would be
helpful if you could maybe

46:42.010 --> 46:44.387
lay out a small
prototype or something.

46:44.429 --> 46:47.849
You know what? I had one,
but I pressed pause on it.

46:47.891 --> 46:50.560
I think I'm going to be
changing it up quite a bit.

46:50.602 --> 46:51.811
How come?

46:51.853 --> 46:53.396
It's just I have to
find a creative way

46:53.438 --> 46:56.191
to incorporate all the things
I've seen and experienced here.

46:56.232 --> 46:58.777
All right, sure.

47:00.403 --> 47:02.614
Can I ask you
a personal question?

47:02.655 --> 47:04.532
Yeah, sure.

47:04.574 --> 47:06.368
I've been thinking a lot
about our college days,

47:06.409 --> 47:09.746
and remember when we broke up,
we agreed to remain friends,

47:09.788 --> 47:11.956
and we were for a while.

47:11.998 --> 47:14.376
Do you think
we'll ever get that back?

47:14.417 --> 47:16.252
It was ten years ago.

47:16.294 --> 47:18.755
I think we've
changed a lot since then.

47:18.797 --> 47:21.508
We're still
the same people, aren't we?

47:21.549 --> 47:22.801
I think most
people change over time.

47:22.842 --> 47:24.969
We have new experiences,

47:25.011 --> 47:27.972
we mature,
we meet different people.

47:28.014 --> 47:30.642
We make new friends
that replace the old ones.

47:30.684 --> 47:32.977
I don't think
meeting new friends

47:33.019 --> 47:35.522
means you need
to replace the old ones.

47:35.563 --> 47:36.856
I see the way
you are with Megan.

47:36.898 --> 47:38.149
And I used to be that friend

47:38.191 --> 47:39.776
that you laughed with
and had fun with,

47:39.818 --> 47:42.987
and I guess I'm just--
just a little envious of that.

47:43.029 --> 47:44.489
Envious?

47:44.531 --> 47:46.700
I guess I just feel
a little slighted.

47:46.741 --> 47:49.536
I'm sorry,
that wasn't my intention.

47:49.577 --> 47:51.996
I guess when we
bought Colvin Designs,

47:52.038 --> 47:54.666
I assumed that we could just
rekindle our old friendship

47:54.708 --> 47:57.210
and work together
to build my new division.

47:57.252 --> 48:00.088
You're now my new boss.

48:00.130 --> 48:03.216
It's impossible
for things to stay the same.

48:03.258 --> 48:05.844
Yep.
All right.

48:08.388 --> 48:11.349
(chattering)

48:12.392 --> 48:15.854
(chittering)

48:15.895 --> 48:18.106
How's everything going
with Tim?

48:18.148 --> 48:19.399
Good.

48:19.441 --> 48:22.277
Good?
That-- that's it?

48:22.318 --> 48:24.738
Yeah, I'm having fun.

48:24.779 --> 48:28.950
Wow! Megan Henry finally
admitting to having fun.

48:28.992 --> 48:30.410
Now, that's progress!

48:30.452 --> 48:34.581
Wait, is that a spark of love
that I sense in the air?

48:34.622 --> 48:36.708
Okay, don't take it
too far.

48:36.750 --> 48:38.126
In two weeks,
he's going to be home,

48:38.168 --> 48:40.211
and I'm going to be
back to my statistics,

48:40.253 --> 48:42.589
chasing lions,
and finishing my defense.

48:42.630 --> 48:45.842
Yeah, okay. And then, he'll be
back in New York with Amy.

48:45.884 --> 48:47.886
Don't you just
find it strange

48:47.927 --> 48:49.471
that she's here
in the first place?

48:49.512 --> 48:54.351
Yeah, I do,
but she's his new boss.

48:54.392 --> 48:56.102
(buzzing)

48:56.144 --> 48:57.896
Kamara:
Where did that come from?

48:57.937 --> 48:59.856
Looks like the lodge.

49:04.277 --> 49:05.945
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:05.987 --> 49:07.739
Kamara and I just spotted a
drone flying near the hyena den.

49:07.781 --> 49:09.491
It looked like it was
launched from here.

49:09.532 --> 49:12.410
Yes. Several other rangers
saw it too and called it in.

49:12.452 --> 49:14.454
Well, any idea
who's flying it?

49:14.496 --> 49:16.623
No, but one of the reports
said it was a guest of yours.

49:16.664 --> 49:18.249
Looked like the same one
they saw last week.

49:18.291 --> 49:20.418
- It had a yellow stripe.
- No, that's impossible.

49:20.460 --> 49:22.712
I mean, the only person I know
of that has a drone is Tim,

49:22.754 --> 49:24.756
and there's no way
he would be flying it.

49:24.798 --> 49:26.758
Is it possible
that it was another guest?

49:26.800 --> 49:29.260
Tim's drone is the only one
I've registered here.

49:29.302 --> 49:31.763
(sighing)
It doesn't make any sense.

49:31.805 --> 49:34.140
No, it doesn't,
but you know how unbending

49:34.182 --> 49:37.018
the anti-poaching team is
about the use of drones.

49:37.060 --> 49:39.437
They may ask for a temporary
suspension of your license.

49:39.479 --> 49:42.857
Is there anything
I can do to resolve this?

49:42.899 --> 49:44.401
I only have two more weeks.

49:44.442 --> 49:46.820
You'll have to ask Tim to turn
in his drone immediately.

49:46.861 --> 49:48.947
Okay.
Do you know where he is?

49:48.988 --> 49:52.325
I saw him a little while ago in
the giraffe garden with Amy.

49:52.367 --> 49:53.702
Okay.

49:53.743 --> 49:55.203
Thank you.

50:05.338 --> 50:09.134
Hey, um, can I talk
to you for a minute?

50:09.175 --> 50:11.011
Yeah, sure.

50:11.052 --> 50:13.638
Privately, if that's okay.

50:13.680 --> 50:16.099
- No problem.
- Thanks.

50:20.562 --> 50:23.982
Do you know anything about
a drone flying over the park

50:24.024 --> 50:25.233
about a mile
or so from here?

50:26.776 --> 50:29.112
No, no. I've been working
with Amy all day.

50:29.154 --> 50:30.864
Why? What's up?
Is something wrong?

50:30.905 --> 50:32.449
Yeah, some complaints
were registered.

50:32.490 --> 50:35.076
My name was mentioned.

50:35.118 --> 50:37.996
Look, Tim, I'm-- I'm gonna
have to take your drone.

50:39.497 --> 50:40.999
What?

50:41.041 --> 50:43.168
I need to confiscate it.

50:43.209 --> 50:45.128
You're not suggesting I was
the one that was flying it.

50:45.170 --> 50:46.713
No, I'm not accusing
you of anything.

50:46.755 --> 50:48.381
Well, it sounds
like you are.

50:48.423 --> 50:52.427
Tim, I need you to understand
I have a lot on the line here.

50:52.469 --> 50:55.347
This is the second drone
incident in two weeks.

50:55.388 --> 50:57.223
If this is linked to me
in any way,

50:57.265 --> 50:59.225
I could lose
my ranger's license.

50:59.267 --> 51:00.310
Do you know
what that would mean?

51:00.352 --> 51:01.853
- Well, I can't--
- It would mean

51:01.895 --> 51:03.480
that I would have to
shut down all of my research.

51:03.521 --> 51:05.899
Well, I can tell you that your
name won't be linked to it

51:05.940 --> 51:08.193
because it wasn't my drone.

51:08.234 --> 51:10.362
Well, is there any way
that somebody else

51:10.403 --> 51:11.738
could have gotten
their hands on it?

51:11.780 --> 51:13.448
No, Darius is
the one that has it

51:13.490 --> 51:15.700
and there's no way
he would have flown it.

51:15.742 --> 51:17.535
Well, I'm gonna
need you to check

51:17.577 --> 51:19.704
because you're the only guest
that we know of that have one.

51:19.746 --> 51:21.122
I don't know what
to say, I'll--

51:21.164 --> 51:24.250
I'll make sure we hand
the drone in later today.

51:24.292 --> 51:28.505
Thank you. We should get it
back to you when you're leaving.

51:28.546 --> 51:30.090
Okay.

51:34.761 --> 51:37.681
(sighing)

51:41.017 --> 51:43.478
- Hey, man.
- Hi.

51:43.520 --> 51:45.522
I just spoke to Megan.

51:45.563 --> 51:48.733
Yeah, she came to see me.
She seemed pretty upset.

51:48.775 --> 51:49.984
Yeah.
Where's the drone?

51:50.026 --> 51:51.778
It's in my room.

51:51.820 --> 51:53.405
You didn't lend it
to anyone, did you?

51:53.446 --> 51:55.073
No, I wouldn't do that.

51:55.115 --> 51:57.492
We need to hand it in to
Mom Nozi right away.

51:57.534 --> 51:59.661
Okay, I'll do that now.

51:59.703 --> 52:03.289
Okay. Thanks.
Catch you in a bit.

52:11.548 --> 52:14.175
- Hey, Panco.
- Hello. How are you?

52:14.217 --> 52:15.844
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:17.762 --> 52:19.305
Any news
on the drone yet?

52:19.347 --> 52:22.892
Nothing yet,
but I'm working on it.

52:25.145 --> 52:26.980
Mom Nozi, I hope you know
I would never allow

52:27.022 --> 52:28.982
one of my guests
to fly a drone here.

52:29.024 --> 52:30.483
Oh, Megan,
I know that.

52:30.525 --> 52:32.235
You'd be the first person
to shut them down.

52:34.237 --> 52:37.323
Is this going to reflect
poorly on you or the reserve?

52:37.365 --> 52:41.202
Don't worry about us.
It'll all get sorted out.

52:42.370 --> 52:45.874
Thank you for everything
you've done to help me.

52:45.915 --> 52:47.667
I'm shutting down
for the night.

52:47.709 --> 52:50.587
Can I offer you a nice
cold glass of white wine?

52:52.672 --> 52:56.134
(chuckling) I would love one.
Yeah.

52:56.176 --> 52:57.886
- Oh...
- Thank you.

52:57.927 --> 52:59.679
You're the best.

52:59.721 --> 53:01.765
- Thank you, Panco.
- Panco: Thank you so much.

53:01.806 --> 53:03.224
Both:
Cheers.

53:04.184 --> 53:05.685
Have a good sleep.

53:05.727 --> 53:07.562
I will.

53:15.695 --> 53:17.364
Megan, hey.

53:17.405 --> 53:18.698
Hi.

53:18.740 --> 53:20.367
Hey.

53:20.408 --> 53:22.911
Um, do you have a second?

53:24.120 --> 53:26.247
Sure.

53:30.919 --> 53:32.796
Today, was a strange day.

53:32.837 --> 53:35.340
Yes, it was.

53:35.382 --> 53:36.966
I hope that you know I had
nothing to do with the drone.

53:37.008 --> 53:39.969
I would never do anything
to ruin your reputation

53:40.011 --> 53:42.889
or jeopardize what you've worked
so hard to accomplish here.

53:42.931 --> 53:45.183
I know. I just panicked when I
thought there was a chance

53:45.225 --> 53:46.476
that I could lose
my ranger's license

53:46.518 --> 53:48.186
and not be able to
complete my research.

53:48.228 --> 53:50.355
Well, that's understandable.

53:50.397 --> 53:52.524
You know,
when I first came here,

53:52.565 --> 53:56.444
I was so proud of myself.

53:56.486 --> 53:59.364
I would just hate to
leave feeling ashamed.

53:59.406 --> 54:01.408
Why would you feel ashamed?

54:01.449 --> 54:05.286
You're smart, strong,

54:05.328 --> 54:09.082
hands-down you're the bravest
person I've ever known.

54:09.124 --> 54:10.583
I'm not that brave,
believe me.

54:10.625 --> 54:12.168
I'm serious!

54:12.210 --> 54:14.546
There's not one the same that
you've been afraid of out there.

54:14.587 --> 54:19.259
Oh... lots of things
scare me, believe me.

54:19.300 --> 54:21.011
Okay, like what?

54:21.052 --> 54:23.763
Like failure.

54:23.805 --> 54:26.558
Not finishing
what I came here to do.

54:26.599 --> 54:28.768
Haven't you achieved
everything you came here for?

54:28.810 --> 54:31.354
No, I still want to do more
research on the white lions.

54:31.396 --> 54:33.606
That was my biggest goal.

54:33.648 --> 54:35.692
And if, for some reason, you
can't find them, then what?

54:35.734 --> 54:38.153
Hmm... Then,
I will still submit my thesis

54:38.194 --> 54:41.781
and hopefully get my PhD.

54:41.823 --> 54:43.992
Of course
you're gonna get your PhD.

54:46.327 --> 54:47.912
You know what?

54:47.954 --> 54:49.414
What?

54:49.456 --> 54:51.291
I can't drink wine
without a snack.

54:51.332 --> 54:53.460
I can't drink beer
without a snack.

54:53.501 --> 54:55.462
Do you think
we should order in?

54:55.503 --> 54:57.130
- Yes!
- Maybe pizza?

54:57.172 --> 54:58.590
Yeah, I'd love pizza.

55:00.508 --> 55:04.054
Wait a second, is this one
of those cab jokes again?

55:04.095 --> 55:06.139
Maybe.

55:06.181 --> 55:09.017
Oh. Ha-ha.
Got me again.

55:10.226 --> 55:12.270
Well, now, I'm hungry.

55:12.312 --> 55:14.356
Follow me.
I have an idea.

55:19.110 --> 55:21.071
Eeh...

55:23.114 --> 55:25.700
Okay, don't mind
if I do.

55:29.913 --> 55:31.331
What do you think?

55:31.373 --> 55:33.667
Malva pudding is officially
my new favorite dessert.

55:33.708 --> 55:34.876
Yes!

55:35.919 --> 55:37.337
Wow.

55:37.379 --> 55:40.006
Maybe I should add
chef to my resume.

55:40.048 --> 55:41.800
I don't know if it's actually
going to help me

55:41.841 --> 55:42.759
with my defense.

55:42.801 --> 55:45.428
Don't underestimate
yourself.

55:45.470 --> 55:48.473
I've seen people be swayed
by a delicious dessert.

55:48.515 --> 55:50.684
(chuckling)
Speak for yourself.

55:50.725 --> 55:54.062
Hey, I'm going to head into the
village tomorrow with Kamara.

55:54.104 --> 55:55.605
Do you want to come?

55:55.647 --> 55:58.525
Yeah, I'd love
to take a break.

55:58.566 --> 56:00.652
Darius is coming, too.

56:00.694 --> 56:02.445
If you want to,
you can invite Amy.

56:03.822 --> 56:06.491
I think she has a day
at the spa tomorrow.

56:07.742 --> 56:09.411
Okay.

56:14.249 --> 56:16.209
(chuckling)

56:16.251 --> 56:18.086
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:19.421 --> 56:21.840
And this is my mom
and my sister Annika.

56:21.881 --> 56:23.466
Hi!

56:23.508 --> 56:24.551
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

56:24.592 --> 56:26.720
So, my mom has a
store in Johannesburg.

56:26.761 --> 56:28.680
She comes here once a week.
All the profits from here

56:28.722 --> 56:31.307
go back to the village
to supply clean water.

56:31.349 --> 56:33.226
Oh, that's great.
I love that.

56:33.268 --> 56:34.978
- That's so nice.
- Yes. Thanks.

56:35.020 --> 56:36.730
These are beautiful.

56:36.771 --> 56:38.773
What do you think?
Like this? My color?

56:38.815 --> 56:41.234
You know what? I think
you're more of an autumn.

56:41.276 --> 56:42.527
Let's see.

56:42.569 --> 56:45.113
Oh, yes.
It's definitely your color.

56:45.155 --> 56:46.740
It's so you!

56:46.781 --> 56:52.245
*

56:52.287 --> 56:54.289
Thank you very much.

56:54.330 --> 56:55.707
Thank you.

56:57.917 --> 56:59.586
Bye.

57:03.214 --> 57:04.299
These are nice.

57:04.341 --> 57:05.759
Yeah, my mom's
going to love these.

57:05.800 --> 57:08.136
She-- she makes clothes
for all of her grandchildren.

57:08.178 --> 57:09.429
Oh.

57:09.471 --> 57:11.097
Do you have
a big family?

57:11.139 --> 57:13.808
No, actually. It's, um--
it's just me and my mom.

57:13.850 --> 57:15.727
My parents
split up when I was two,

57:15.769 --> 57:17.562
so she raised me
on her own.

57:17.604 --> 57:18.897
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:18.938 --> 57:20.815
Was that difficult?

57:20.857 --> 57:23.610
I mean, we didn't
have a ton financially,

57:23.651 --> 57:25.820
but she made up
for it with more love

57:25.862 --> 57:27.947
than any kid
could ever ask for,

57:27.989 --> 57:31.826
even though she was working
two jobs to make ends meet.

57:31.868 --> 57:33.870
You sound a lot
like your mom.

57:33.912 --> 57:35.789
She was really young
when she had me,

57:35.830 --> 57:38.875
so she had to
give up a lot to raise me,

57:38.917 --> 57:40.752
but she always made sure
I had the best,

57:40.794 --> 57:43.171
went to the best schools.

57:43.213 --> 57:45.715
Is that why you're
so determined?

57:45.757 --> 57:49.928
Yeah. I-- I want her to be
proud of who I've become.

57:49.969 --> 57:53.139
I'm sure she is.
How could she not be?

57:53.181 --> 57:54.724
Where is she now?

57:54.766 --> 57:57.102
She actually has an apartment
by mine at the university.

57:57.143 --> 57:59.145
After I got my undergrad,

57:59.187 --> 58:01.272
she went to college and
got a degree in nursing.

58:01.314 --> 58:02.482
That's incredible.

58:02.524 --> 58:04.359
Yeah. Yeah,
she even found new love.

58:04.401 --> 58:07.362
It's about time she had some
real happiness in her life.

58:07.404 --> 58:10.782
That's why I would never want to
do anything to disappoint her.

58:10.824 --> 58:13.451
Wait, hold on.
Do I hear a tiny bit

58:13.493 --> 58:15.036
of you being a perfectionist
creep back in?

58:15.078 --> 58:16.871
Is that what I hear here?

58:16.913 --> 58:21.793
No! Me?
That is so yesterday.

58:21.835 --> 58:25.547
I--
I got you a little something.

58:25.588 --> 58:27.298
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:27.340 --> 58:29.342
- I got you something.
- Really?

58:29.384 --> 58:30.635
All right, well...

58:30.677 --> 58:31.845
- On three?
- On three.

58:31.886 --> 58:33.596
One, two, three.

58:35.056 --> 58:36.516
- No.
- What?

58:36.558 --> 58:37.767
The same one?

58:37.809 --> 58:39.769
Which hand would
you like yours on?

58:39.811 --> 58:41.271
- Put it on this one here.
- Okay.

58:45.150 --> 58:47.193
Thank you.
There you go.

58:47.235 --> 58:48.611
Thank you.

58:51.614 --> 58:53.074
I love it.

58:53.116 --> 58:55.243
I love mine.

59:03.501 --> 59:05.503
Oh-whee!

59:05.545 --> 59:08.631
Oh, man, I got some
really awesome footage today.

59:08.673 --> 59:10.675
I'm going to go ahead and
start downloading this, yeah?

59:10.717 --> 59:12.385
Do you want some company?

59:12.427 --> 59:14.262
I'd love some company.

59:14.304 --> 59:15.847
Come on.

59:15.889 --> 59:18.350
Well, looks like
we've been ditched.

59:18.391 --> 59:20.143
(chuckling)

59:20.185 --> 59:21.561
- Hey.
- Megan: Hey.

59:21.603 --> 59:23.271
- Hope you guys had a good day.
- Yeah, it was great.

59:23.313 --> 59:24.397
Yeah.

59:25.398 --> 59:27.400
- Oh, I love your bracelet.
- Oh!

59:27.442 --> 59:29.569
Thank you.
Yeah, um...

59:29.611 --> 59:31.196
Tim actually
got it for me today.

59:31.237 --> 59:33.073
And Megan actually
got me the same one.

59:33.114 --> 59:34.699
Yeah.

59:34.741 --> 59:37.077
What... are the chances?

59:37.118 --> 59:38.453
(Megan chuckling nervously)

59:38.495 --> 59:39.996
You know what?

59:40.038 --> 59:41.373
I should get this
stuff back to my room.

59:41.414 --> 59:43.375
But we're still on
for the drive tomorrow?

59:43.416 --> 59:44.584
- Yes, we are.
- Okay.

59:44.626 --> 59:46.544
- Bye.
- Amy: Bye.

59:46.586 --> 59:48.421
Phew.
I'm glad you're back.

59:48.463 --> 59:50.840
It can get
kind of boring around here.

59:50.882 --> 59:52.217
Yeah, I guess so.

59:52.258 --> 59:54.427
Yeah. Hey, so I would love to
talk with you

59:54.469 --> 59:55.553
about something important.

59:55.595 --> 59:57.138
- Okay.
- Yeah.

59:57.180 --> 59:59.224
So, why don't we grab dinner,
maybe a glass of champagne?

59:59.265 --> 01:00:01.393
We might have something
big to celebrate.

01:00:01.434 --> 01:00:06.064
Yeah, I'm a little tired.
Can we just grab a coffee?

01:00:06.106 --> 01:00:08.191
Yeah, coffee.
Yeah. Coffee it is.

01:00:08.233 --> 01:00:09.192
Right now?

01:00:09.234 --> 01:00:10.777
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Okay.

01:00:10.819 --> 01:00:13.405
Did you get everything
downloaded?

01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:17.200
What's wrong?

01:00:17.242 --> 01:00:19.786
Darius needs to
tell you something.

01:00:19.828 --> 01:00:21.705
Okay.

01:00:21.746 --> 01:00:26.459
Megan, I feel really ashamed
of myself and I'm so sorry.

01:00:26.501 --> 01:00:28.712
Sorry about what?

01:00:28.753 --> 01:00:30.714
I'm the one
who flew the drone.

01:00:30.755 --> 01:00:32.007
Megan:
What?

01:00:32.048 --> 01:00:33.299
I don't understand.

01:00:33.341 --> 01:00:34.926
I made a really
stupid mistake.

01:00:34.968 --> 01:00:37.637
The thing is,
I was chatting with Amy

01:00:37.679 --> 01:00:39.931
and she had said she'd
really like some aerial shots.

01:00:39.973 --> 01:00:41.599
And seeing that
she's now my boss,

01:00:41.641 --> 01:00:44.686
I figured I'd at least
try to get her a few.

01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:47.022
Look, I really hope I didn't
harm your reputation.

01:00:47.063 --> 01:00:48.898
I'll tell Mom Nozi
right away.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.442
No, Darius,
it's okay.

01:00:50.483 --> 01:00:53.319
I appreciate your honesty
more than anything.

01:00:53.361 --> 01:00:55.572
I just don't really understand
why Amy would have

01:00:55.613 --> 01:00:56.781
asked you to do that.

01:00:56.823 --> 01:00:58.783
Darius:
She didn't exactly ask me.

01:00:58.825 --> 01:01:00.952
She just said
she'd like some shots.

01:01:00.994 --> 01:01:03.455
And so, I took it
upon myself to get them.

01:01:03.496 --> 01:01:06.916
In retrospect,
it was a really stupid idea.

01:01:06.958 --> 01:01:09.127
Have you told Tim?

01:01:09.169 --> 01:01:11.755
No. Please, don't say
anything to Tim or Amy.

01:01:11.796 --> 01:01:13.131
Megan:
I won't.

01:01:13.173 --> 01:01:15.216
But I do think you
should tell him yourself.

01:01:15.258 --> 01:01:17.677
I really think
he'll understand.

01:01:23.183 --> 01:01:25.477
How would you
feel about taking on

01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:27.645
more responsibility
with the company?

01:01:27.687 --> 01:01:29.314
What do you mean?

01:01:29.356 --> 01:01:32.359
I need a business partner, and
you're the best in the industry,

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.403
and Daddy and I would just
love to have you on the team.

01:01:35.445 --> 01:01:39.366
Well, thank you.
But what would that entail?

01:01:39.407 --> 01:01:41.993
Um, overseeing
all the new projects,

01:01:42.035 --> 01:01:45.914
a step up the ladder...
a big raise.

01:01:45.955 --> 01:01:47.874
Does that mean
I'll be on the road more

01:01:47.916 --> 01:01:49.501
or stationed
at head office?

01:01:49.542 --> 01:01:51.002
Oh, no,

01:01:51.044 --> 01:01:52.504
you'd be working
more directly with me.

01:01:52.545 --> 01:01:54.839
And of course, a vice president
position down the road,

01:01:54.881 --> 01:01:56.508
if it all works out.

01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:59.803
What about my team
at Colvin Designs?

01:01:59.844 --> 01:02:02.180
Oh, no,
I already have my own people.

01:02:02.222 --> 01:02:04.474
- (elephant trumpeting)
- Oh!

01:02:04.516 --> 01:02:06.434
(trumpeting)

01:02:08.728 --> 01:02:16.277
*

01:02:16.319 --> 01:02:20.407
I'm so sorry. I got a call
saying they were here.

01:02:22.617 --> 01:02:24.661
Well, I could think of
worse places to be.

01:02:26.663 --> 01:02:29.082
I think I might come out
again tomorrow afternoon

01:02:29.124 --> 01:02:31.376
to see if I can spot them,
if you want to come.

01:02:31.418 --> 01:02:33.545
Count me in.

01:02:33.586 --> 01:02:35.380
I forgot to tell you I have
to do a quick trip

01:02:35.422 --> 01:02:39.217
to Johannesburg tomorrow
to pick up some equipment.

01:02:39.259 --> 01:02:41.845
Okay. Oh, do you think you could
pick up a thumb drive for me?

01:02:41.886 --> 01:02:43.471
Yeah, of course.
But...

01:02:43.513 --> 01:02:45.390
why don't you
come with me?

01:02:45.432 --> 01:02:49.894
We could leave early,
get back just after lunch.

01:02:49.936 --> 01:02:53.732
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

01:02:53.773 --> 01:02:56.151
That would be fun.

01:02:59.946 --> 01:03:03.366
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, finally!

01:03:05.952 --> 01:03:07.871
Aren't they beautiful?

01:03:12.292 --> 01:03:15.420
Yeah, they're just right here.
How did we miss them?

01:03:15.462 --> 01:03:19.090
(low growling)

01:03:19.132 --> 01:03:22.635
I think this might be
the best day of my life.

01:03:24.804 --> 01:03:26.848
(sighing contentedly)

01:03:32.312 --> 01:03:40.737
*

01:03:41.946 --> 01:03:43.448
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:45.533
Tim Erickson, there was a
delivery that was made for me.

01:03:45.575 --> 01:03:46.701
Yes, Mr. Erickson.

01:03:46.743 --> 01:03:47.952
Would you like us
to bring the packages

01:03:47.994 --> 01:03:49.120
to your vehicle right now?

01:03:49.162 --> 01:03:50.288
Yeah, that'd be great.
Please.

01:03:50.330 --> 01:03:51.831
- No problem.
- Thank you.

01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:55.126
You hungry?

01:03:55.168 --> 01:03:56.795
I made reservations
at Aduna here.

01:03:56.836 --> 01:03:58.797
I'm hungry.

01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:03.677
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

01:04:07.514 --> 01:04:09.432
Oh, I keep forgetting to
ask you about your design.

01:04:09.474 --> 01:04:11.935
Have you done more work on it?

01:04:11.976 --> 01:04:16.189
I'm getting a lot of... great
ideas, which is why I came here.

01:04:16.231 --> 01:04:19.651
Good. I guess you must be
getting down to the wire.

01:04:19.693 --> 01:04:21.653
One week left.

01:04:21.695 --> 01:04:23.446
It's going to be
kind of a jolt to leave here

01:04:23.488 --> 01:04:26.491
and not see you every day.

01:04:26.533 --> 01:04:29.994
You never know, it might be
a refreshing change of pace.

01:04:30.036 --> 01:04:32.372
No, no,
I'm going to miss this place,

01:04:32.414 --> 01:04:34.165
and I'm going
to miss you.

01:04:34.207 --> 01:04:37.752
I'm going
to miss you, too.

01:04:37.794 --> 01:04:40.797
It's been
really nice having you here.

01:04:40.839 --> 01:04:42.090
What if,
when we leave here,

01:04:42.132 --> 01:04:44.300
I come visit you,

01:04:44.342 --> 01:04:48.221
and we can go out
on a real date?

01:04:48.263 --> 01:04:50.265
Tim, I don't want to get
my heart broken again.

01:04:50.306 --> 01:04:51.683
And once you leave,

01:04:51.725 --> 01:04:53.518
I just don't see how we
could make something work.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.604
How will we know
if we don't try?

01:04:58.398 --> 01:05:00.734
Long-distance
relationships are hard,

01:05:00.775 --> 01:05:02.902
trust me.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:09.367
Can we just try to enjoy
the time we have left?

01:05:16.082 --> 01:05:17.834
We got a flight to catch.

01:05:17.876 --> 01:05:20.462
Why don't we go back and try
to find those white lions?

01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:24.049
Okay.

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:33.850
*

01:05:34.934 --> 01:05:36.853
(roaring)

01:05:38.646 --> 01:05:40.940
I cannot tell you
how happy I am

01:05:40.982 --> 01:05:42.192
you're getting
to see them again.

01:05:42.233 --> 01:05:45.111
This is so special

01:05:45.153 --> 01:05:48.239
- Yeah.
- (camera shutter clicking)

01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:50.450
I can't believe I get to
experience this with you.

01:05:51.493 --> 01:05:52.952
Me, too.

01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:00.210
Oh, no.
Don't go, don't go.

01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:02.295
(camera shutter clicking)

01:06:03.338 --> 01:06:06.091
Okay,
I think it's about that time.

01:06:06.132 --> 01:06:08.093
What time?

01:06:08.134 --> 01:06:09.177
Time for a sundowner.

01:06:09.219 --> 01:06:10.845
A sundowner?

01:06:10.887 --> 01:06:11.930
Have you never had one?

01:06:11.971 --> 01:06:13.098
Nope.

01:06:13.139 --> 01:06:14.265
Okay, well,
it's tradition here,

01:06:14.307 --> 01:06:15.600
and you have to
have at least one

01:06:15.642 --> 01:06:17.102
to have a true
South African safari.

01:06:17.143 --> 01:06:21.022
Okay. Let's go!

01:06:26.653 --> 01:06:30.657
(animals grunting
in the distance)

01:06:30.699 --> 01:06:32.784
Tim:
This is unbelievable.

01:06:35.036 --> 01:06:37.664
I don't want it to end.

01:06:37.706 --> 01:06:39.708
Yeah, it's pretty magical,
isn't it?

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.379
Do you think you're gonna be
spending a lot of time

01:06:44.421 --> 01:06:46.172
in New York
when you get back?

01:06:46.214 --> 01:06:48.675
More than I planned.

01:06:49.592 --> 01:06:51.678
Amy offered me
a partnership.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:55.724
Wow!
That's a generous offer.

01:06:55.765 --> 01:06:57.350
It's a great opportunity,

01:06:57.392 --> 01:06:59.853
but I'll be doing
a lot less design work

01:06:59.894 --> 01:07:02.355
and more administration to
help build out the company.

01:07:02.397 --> 01:07:04.024
Do you think
that'll make you happy?

01:07:04.065 --> 01:07:05.692
I don't know.

01:07:05.734 --> 01:07:08.028
So, where does that
leave you and Amy?

01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:09.696
Well, I guess
I'll be working

01:07:09.738 --> 01:07:11.031
out of the head office
a lot more.

01:07:11.072 --> 01:07:13.199
You think that's
going to be easy to do?

01:07:13.241 --> 01:07:14.951
With your history?

01:07:14.993 --> 01:07:16.870
Yeah, I think so.

01:07:16.911 --> 01:07:19.414
The boundaries are clear.
The past is the past.

01:07:19.456 --> 01:07:21.249
Do you think
it'll be easy for her?

01:07:21.291 --> 01:07:23.084
I don't see why not.

01:07:24.336 --> 01:07:25.420
Why do you ask?

01:07:25.462 --> 01:07:27.756
Just a feeling.

01:07:36.264 --> 01:07:39.309
Tim: Yeah, that sundowner last
night was really incredible.

01:07:39.351 --> 01:07:41.311
Um, hey, Tim.

01:07:41.353 --> 01:07:42.562
Yeah.

01:07:42.604 --> 01:07:43.897
Look man,
I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

01:07:43.938 --> 01:07:46.191
There's something
I need to tell you.

01:07:46.232 --> 01:07:48.193
Okay.

01:07:48.234 --> 01:07:49.736
It's about the drone.

01:07:49.778 --> 01:07:52.822
Uh... I'm the one
who flew it.

01:07:53.823 --> 01:07:54.699
What?

01:07:54.741 --> 01:07:56.326
I'm really sorry, man.

01:08:00.955 --> 01:08:03.124
Uh...

01:08:04.793 --> 01:08:06.753
Why didn't you admit it?

01:08:06.795 --> 01:08:09.506
Well,
I didn't want to lose my job.

01:08:09.547 --> 01:08:11.132
Why would you ever
worry about that?

01:08:13.176 --> 01:08:14.719
Wait a second.

01:08:14.761 --> 01:08:16.554
Did Amy put you
up for this?

01:08:16.595 --> 01:08:18.264
No. I'm not blaming
Amy for anything.

01:08:18.305 --> 01:08:19.557
She didn't ask me.

01:08:19.599 --> 01:08:21.142
She just said she'd
like some footage.

01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:24.062
And so, I foolishly went
ahead and did it on my own.

01:08:24.104 --> 01:08:26.773
Tim,

01:08:26.814 --> 01:08:29.192
Darius has taken full
responsibility for this.

01:08:29.234 --> 01:08:31.778
He told us the truth and he's
told Mom Nozi the truth.

01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:34.406
No, no. Wait.
But what about Amy?

01:08:34.447 --> 01:08:36.323
She's responsible
for all of this.

01:08:36.366 --> 01:08:40.662
No, Kamara, I 100% take
responsibility for this, okay?

01:08:40.703 --> 01:08:44.124
Tim: I'm gonna straighten
this out with Amy,

01:08:44.165 --> 01:08:45.582
if that's okay.

01:08:45.625 --> 01:08:47.042
What if she fires me?

01:08:48.837 --> 01:08:52.465
You will always
have a job with me,

01:08:52.506 --> 01:08:54.426
no matter where I am.

01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:59.055
Thanks.

01:09:00.473 --> 01:09:02.809
- Thanks for telling me.
- Darius: Yeah.

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:06.895
- (elephant trumpeting)
- Hey.

01:09:06.938 --> 01:09:10.316
Oh.
Best view I ever had.

01:09:10.358 --> 01:09:13.903
Hey, maybe we can do, like,
a satellite office over here.

01:09:13.944 --> 01:09:16.281
What do you think? We could work
here during the winter.

01:09:16.322 --> 01:09:17.907
We need to talk.

01:09:17.948 --> 01:09:20.076
I just, I spoke to Darius
and he told me what happened.

01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:22.078
Oh, my gosh,
did something happen?

01:09:23.328 --> 01:09:26.124
Come on, Amy.

01:09:26.166 --> 01:09:27.834
Don't play this game.
You know what's going on.

01:09:27.876 --> 01:09:29.669
I'm sorry,
I honestly don't.

01:09:29.711 --> 01:09:31.421
- The drone?
- Yeah.

01:09:31.462 --> 01:09:32.671
Yeah?

01:09:32.714 --> 01:09:34.131
Oh, sorry.

01:09:34.174 --> 01:09:36.009
You don't think I had something
to do with that, do you?

01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:39.179
You didn't tell Darius you
needed some aerial shots?

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:40.513
I told everybody.

01:09:40.555 --> 01:09:43.558
I told you,
Megan, Darius, everyone.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.518
Guess he
misinterpreted what I said.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.354
Did you ever consider what this
could have done to Megan?

01:09:48.395 --> 01:09:50.939
She could have lost
her license and missed out

01:09:50.982 --> 01:09:52.942
on the opportunity
to finish her research.

01:09:52.984 --> 01:09:54.486
I wouldn't worry
about her too much.

01:09:54.527 --> 01:09:55.653
She can take care
of herself.

01:09:55.695 --> 01:09:57.739
Oh, come on, Amy.

01:09:58.865 --> 01:10:02.744
You know what?
I'm done with this.

01:10:02.786 --> 01:10:04.412
I'm done with the
way you treat people

01:10:04.454 --> 01:10:06.039
and pretend like you're
innocent,

01:10:06.081 --> 01:10:07.957
when you know full well you've
done something wrong.

01:10:07.999 --> 01:10:09.668
The only reason I came here

01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:12.629
was because of our friendship,
because I wanted to offer you

01:10:12.671 --> 01:10:14.214
an opportunity
to build your career.

01:10:14.255 --> 01:10:16.466
I don't need you
to bolster my career.

01:10:16.508 --> 01:10:18.051
And honestly,

01:10:18.093 --> 01:10:20.303
I don't know if I could
ever work with you again,

01:10:20.345 --> 01:10:22.263
not after this.

01:10:25.642 --> 01:10:30.271
(grunting)

01:10:33.191 --> 01:10:34.401
Morning.

01:10:34.442 --> 01:10:36.903
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10:36.945 --> 01:10:38.697
Well, I talked
to Amy last night.

01:10:38.738 --> 01:10:39.906
Yeah?

01:10:39.948 --> 01:10:42.575
And it didn't go too well.

01:10:42.617 --> 01:10:43.952
I quit my job.

01:10:43.993 --> 01:10:45.829
Tim, are you sure
that's what you want to do?

01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:47.497
Yeah, it's the right move.

01:10:47.539 --> 01:10:49.958
I mean, what about your design?
You've worked so hard on it.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.543
I know.

01:10:51.584 --> 01:10:54.462
So, what are you going
to do?

01:10:54.504 --> 01:10:56.673
I have to go back tomorrow.

01:10:56.715 --> 01:11:01.094
Amy left this morning,
but I need to get back

01:11:01.136 --> 01:11:02.762
and talk to my old boss
Jim at Colvin Designs

01:11:02.804 --> 01:11:05.807
and see if we can
figure something out.

01:11:05.849 --> 01:11:09.144
I'm really sorry
this happened.

01:11:09.185 --> 01:11:11.771
I know how important
this job was to you.

01:11:11.813 --> 01:11:16.026
It was, but, you know,
I'm glad it happened.

01:11:17.318 --> 01:11:19.154
Made me remember
the type of person Amy was

01:11:19.195 --> 01:11:20.822
before I started
working with her.

01:11:22.073 --> 01:11:25.118
Well, I'm sure something
good will come from this.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:28.121
I mean you're smart, you're
talented, you're creative.

01:11:28.163 --> 01:11:30.707
Thank you
for believing in me.

01:11:30.749 --> 01:11:33.877
Of course,
I believe in you.

01:11:33.918 --> 01:11:36.046
You're an amazing person.

01:11:36.087 --> 01:11:39.299
And you even
taught me that

01:11:39.341 --> 01:11:41.551
I don't need to take everything
so seriously all the time.

01:11:41.593 --> 01:11:44.971
That's not an easy task.

01:11:47.849 --> 01:11:50.518
Can I see you again
before I go?

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:53.521
Maybe do dinner tonight?

01:11:53.563 --> 01:11:56.358
Yeah.
I would like that.

01:12:00.904 --> 01:12:04.157
These past two weeks,
they've gone by so fast.

01:12:04.199 --> 01:12:05.825
Yeah, they have.

01:12:05.867 --> 01:12:09.287
This has been...

01:12:09.329 --> 01:12:11.664
one of the most phenomenal
experiences of my life.

01:12:11.706 --> 01:12:14.167
For me, too.

01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:16.628
We don't have
to say goodbye.

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:18.630
This doesn't have to be
the end.

01:12:18.672 --> 01:12:20.840
Tim, I...

01:12:20.882 --> 01:12:23.593
I just don't see how
a future for us could work.

01:12:23.635 --> 01:12:27.389
I know
all the odds are against us.

01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:30.934
I don't want this
to be over.

01:12:30.975 --> 01:12:32.686
Me neither.

01:12:32.727 --> 01:12:35.271
But you have a life to get back
to and you have to figure out

01:12:35.313 --> 01:12:37.107
what you're going to do, and I
don't want to be the person

01:12:37.148 --> 01:12:38.733
that stands
in the way of that.

01:12:38.775 --> 01:12:39.859
I don't want to be the person

01:12:39.901 --> 01:12:41.528
that gets in the way
of you either.

01:12:41.569 --> 01:12:44.364
You've worked your entire
life for what you have.

01:12:44.406 --> 01:12:46.408
Exactly.

01:12:46.449 --> 01:12:48.576
Our lives,
they're just too different.

01:12:48.618 --> 01:12:50.203
But they're not.

01:12:50.245 --> 01:12:53.331
We can't both live our dreams
if we're together.

01:12:53.373 --> 01:12:55.041
What if we can?

01:12:55.083 --> 01:12:58.962
If there was a way to make
this work, I would want to.

01:12:59.004 --> 01:13:01.965
But I just don't see
how it's possible.

01:13:06.803 --> 01:13:10.390
Will I see you tomorrow
before I leave?

01:13:10.432 --> 01:13:13.435
I don't know if
I can say goodbye to you.

01:13:15.353 --> 01:13:17.856
Then, don't.

01:13:17.897 --> 01:13:20.316
I'm sorry.

01:13:33.538 --> 01:13:34.873
(chattering)

01:13:36.041 --> 01:13:38.293
(both laughing)

01:13:38.335 --> 01:13:40.712
Oh... It's been so
great having you here.

01:13:40.754 --> 01:13:42.297
Thank you for everything.

01:13:42.339 --> 01:13:43.590
- Travel safe.
- Yes.

01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:46.551
- Darius.
- Mom.

01:14:01.399 --> 01:14:02.901
Bye.

01:14:02.942 --> 01:14:04.569
(engine revving)

01:14:14.037 --> 01:14:16.915
(breathing shakily)

01:14:22.545 --> 01:14:32.514
*

01:14:33.932 --> 01:14:35.600
(sighing)

01:14:37.227 --> 01:14:38.770
(camera shutter clicking)

01:14:47.237 --> 01:14:48.780
Hey, Megan.

01:14:48.822 --> 01:14:50.573
Hey.

01:14:50.615 --> 01:14:52.951
Tim left this here
for you this morning.

01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:59.416
He didn't want to leave
you behind, you know.

01:14:59.457 --> 01:15:02.210
I didn't want
to see him go.

01:15:02.252 --> 01:15:04.421
I hope you can find
a way back to each other.

01:15:04.462 --> 01:15:06.131
Love doesn't
come along very often.

01:15:06.172 --> 01:15:07.799
I know.

01:15:07.841 --> 01:15:10.051
Follow your heart;

01:15:10.093 --> 01:15:12.345
it'll take you
where you need to be.

01:15:12.387 --> 01:15:14.723
And this...

01:15:14.764 --> 01:15:17.100
is confirmation that
the complaint against you

01:15:17.142 --> 01:15:19.269
has been withdrawn.

01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:21.187
Your ranger's license
is still in good standing.

01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:24.024
- That's a relief.
- I'm so sorry.

01:15:24.065 --> 01:15:25.900
This shouldn't have
happened in the first place.

01:15:25.942 --> 01:15:28.445
No, it's okay.

01:15:28.486 --> 01:15:31.114
I mean, there's a lesson to be
learned in everything, right?

01:15:31.156 --> 01:15:34.534
This taught me not
to jump to conclusions,

01:15:34.576 --> 01:15:36.369
and to trust people
like you...

01:15:36.411 --> 01:15:37.829
who have my back.

01:15:37.871 --> 01:15:39.831
Always.

01:15:53.094 --> 01:16:03.063
*

01:16:07.525 --> 01:16:09.611
Tim (narrating):
"Thanks for all the memories.

01:16:09.652 --> 01:16:11.696
"I left the footage
from the leopard

01:16:11.738 --> 01:16:13.323
"and the white lion sightings.

01:16:13.365 --> 01:16:16.117
"I hope it'll help you dazzle
your thesis defense.

01:16:16.159 --> 01:16:17.786
"And if you see
the white lions again,

01:16:17.827 --> 01:16:19.871
"I'd love
to see the pictures."

01:16:26.044 --> 01:16:30.757
(sighing)

01:16:30.799 --> 01:16:34.969

(phone chiming)

01:17:11.006 --> 01:17:13.383
(sighing)
Okay.

01:17:13.425 --> 01:17:16.803
- I love you so much.
- Megan: I love you.

01:17:16.845 --> 01:17:19.347
I love you, too.

01:17:19.389 --> 01:17:21.516
Okay, my turn.

01:17:23.727 --> 01:17:26.646
We're all going
to miss you.

01:17:26.688 --> 01:17:29.190
Thank you both
so much for everything.

01:17:30.316 --> 01:17:32.736
I'll be back, I promise.

01:17:32.777 --> 01:17:34.696
You better.

01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:46.082
*

01:17:48.418 --> 01:17:51.129
(sighing)
Okay. Thanks, Josh.

01:17:53.256 --> 01:18:03.224
*

01:18:11.191 --> 01:18:12.442
Okay, yeah.

01:18:12.484 --> 01:18:14.569
I'll be right there.

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:23.119
Kamara?

01:18:23.161 --> 01:18:24.704
Oh, my gosh!

01:18:24.746 --> 01:18:26.539
What are you doing here?

01:18:26.581 --> 01:18:28.041
I'm visiting Darius
for a couple of weeks

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:30.752
and I wanted to come
and surprise you.

01:18:30.794 --> 01:18:33.004
Well, this is
an amazing surprise.

01:18:33.046 --> 01:18:35.131
Oh, do you have
a couple of hours to spare?

01:18:35.173 --> 01:18:36.508
Yeah. Why?

01:18:36.549 --> 01:18:37.967
Well, Darius is working
on a short film project

01:18:38.009 --> 01:18:39.636
and he asked me
to come and see it.

01:18:39.678 --> 01:18:41.930
So, do you want
to tag along?

01:18:41.971 --> 01:18:43.515
Yes, I would love to.
I just have to grab my purse.

01:18:43.556 --> 01:18:45.266
Come on,
I'll show you my office.

01:18:45.308 --> 01:18:46.351
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:46.393 --> 01:18:48.895
Megan:
I can't believe you're here.

01:18:54.234 --> 01:18:58.822
Uh... Kamara, are you sure
we're in the right place?

01:18:58.863 --> 01:19:01.991
Positive.
Let me grab Darius.

01:19:02.033 --> 01:19:04.035
Okay.

01:19:14.838 --> 01:19:16.256
Tim:
I'm happy you made it.

01:19:18.383 --> 01:19:20.218
Tim?

01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:22.804
I missed you, Megan.

01:19:22.846 --> 01:19:25.682
Yeah, I've, um--
I've missed you too.

01:19:25.724 --> 01:19:27.600
You know, there hasn't
been a second in the day

01:19:27.642 --> 01:19:29.728
that you weren't
on my mind.

01:19:29.769 --> 01:19:32.272
Can I show you something?

01:19:32.313 --> 01:19:35.150
Okay.

01:19:35.191 --> 01:19:37.152
Remember how you said you
wanted something spectacular

01:19:37.193 --> 01:19:39.154
to impress your committee
for your thesis presentation?

01:19:39.195 --> 01:19:41.031
Yeah.

01:19:41.072 --> 01:19:43.575
Well...

01:19:45.368 --> 01:19:47.495
Um...
Yeah, I mean, it's a--

01:19:47.537 --> 01:19:50.498
it's a little low-key, but...

01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:52.834
Wait, just one minute.
(clearing throat)

01:20:00.258 --> 01:20:02.177
(gasping)

01:20:02.218 --> 01:20:04.554
It's beautiful.
It's...

01:20:04.596 --> 01:20:07.807
It's like we're back there.

01:20:07.849 --> 01:20:09.726
The more I thought about what
I wanted the attraction to be,

01:20:09.768 --> 01:20:11.394
the more I realized...

01:20:11.436 --> 01:20:14.105
it needed to feel real.

01:20:14.147 --> 01:20:15.899
It does.

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:17.942
Thanks to you.

01:20:19.027 --> 01:20:20.695
You're the one that
inspired all of this.

01:20:20.737 --> 01:20:23.323
It's perfect.

01:20:23.365 --> 01:20:26.826
I love it. Oh!

01:20:26.868 --> 01:20:28.453
What happened with your job?

01:20:28.495 --> 01:20:30.705
I talked
to my old boss, Jim.

01:20:30.747 --> 01:20:32.248
This project
had been in development

01:20:32.290 --> 01:20:34.000
long before Amy came around.

01:20:34.042 --> 01:20:36.628
I was the one that
originally thought of this.

01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:38.421
So, Jim and I,
we ran with it.

01:20:38.463 --> 01:20:41.591
And we started our own company
and hired all the employees

01:20:41.633 --> 01:20:43.426
that were let go of by Amy.

01:20:43.468 --> 01:20:45.136
That's incredible.

01:20:45.178 --> 01:20:46.596
I'm really happy for you.

01:20:46.638 --> 01:20:48.723
And the best part is
that Chipperfield -

01:20:48.765 --> 01:20:51.226
the company that I originally
pitched my concept to -

01:20:51.267 --> 01:20:54.062
they bought it,

01:20:54.104 --> 01:20:56.940
and they gave us
a contract to create more.

01:20:56.981 --> 01:20:59.859
All your hard work
paid off.

01:20:59.901 --> 01:21:03.822
I want this company
to become our dream.

01:21:07.075 --> 01:21:08.702
What do you mean?

01:21:08.743 --> 01:21:10.995
They want more
immersive experiences

01:21:11.037 --> 01:21:14.416
from exotic locations
in the wilderness.

01:21:14.457 --> 01:21:16.292
I can work anywhere.

01:21:16.334 --> 01:21:18.878
I can travel with you
while you do your research.

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:21.840
I can do my designs from
wherever we are in the world.

01:21:21.881 --> 01:21:24.926
Are you sure that's
something you would want?

01:21:28.013 --> 01:21:30.807
I have never been
more sure about anything.

01:21:30.849 --> 01:21:33.309
The time I spent
with you in South Africa

01:21:33.351 --> 01:21:35.311
was the happiest
time of my life.

01:21:35.353 --> 01:21:37.272
Mine, too.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:39.816
I was maybe...

01:21:39.858 --> 01:21:42.694
just a little miserable
after you left.

01:21:46.156 --> 01:21:50.326
I'll go anywhere
and do anything for you, Megan.

01:21:50.368 --> 01:21:52.954
I love you
with all my heart.

01:21:55.081 --> 01:21:56.791
Please say you'll
take this chance with me

01:21:56.833 --> 01:21:59.586
and make this dream
our reality.

01:21:59.627 --> 01:22:02.589
You know, no one's
ever been willing to...

01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:05.842
make their
dreams fit with mine.

01:22:05.884 --> 01:22:09.387
I'll do whatever
it takes to make this work.

01:22:09.429 --> 01:22:12.015
I love you, too.

01:22:12.057 --> 01:22:22.067

01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:29.115
(audio of fireworks whistling,
popping, crowd cheering)

01:22:33.828 --> 01:22:35.622
(Megan laughing)

01:22:35.663 --> 01:22:39.042
Tim: I told Darius
I didn't want fireworks.

01:22:39.084 --> 01:22:41.461
Hey, you can never
go wrong with fireworks.

01:22:50.595 --> 01:22:53.890
And this is why
we must make every effort

01:22:53.932 --> 01:22:56.768
to save these
incredible creatures.

01:22:58.812 --> 01:23:02.107
I'd like to dedicate my thesis
defense today to my mom.

01:23:02.148 --> 01:23:06.111
(applauding)

01:23:09.155 --> 01:23:10.407
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:23:10.448 --> 01:23:12.575
Hey.

01:23:12.617 --> 01:23:14.077
Congratulations...

01:23:14.119 --> 01:23:15.995
Dr. Henry.

01:23:23.211 --> 01:23:25.296
I'm proud of you.

01:23:25.338 --> 01:23:27.298
Thank you.

01:23:28.425 --> 01:23:30.427
(elephant trumpeting)

01:23:34.639 --> 01:23:44.816
