00:24.525 --> 00:25.766
Ooh! [growls]

00:25.842 --> 00:27.509
- Mommy!
- Aaaaaaah!

00:27.528 --> 00:29.194
- Duncan!
- Duncan!

00:32.700 --> 00:34.775
- [groans] Stupid hair.

00:34.927 --> 00:37.202
Tame, you damn beast.

00:37.354 --> 00:39.446
Nice.

00:39.598 --> 00:42.783
[panting] Mom, I told you
to pick up your stuff.

00:42.785 --> 00:44.418
- Sorry, sorry.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.714
- I'm stuff.

00:48.865 --> 00:50.883
- Mia will be here
in 13 minutes.

00:51.034 --> 00:52.276
It's her first time
coming over,

00:52.369 --> 00:54.444
and I just want the evening
to be dope as hell.

00:54.446 --> 00:56.871
Is that so much to ask?
Dope as hell?

00:56.891 --> 00:58.724
- Ooh, somebody's nervous.

00:58.951 --> 01:00.133
- Of course I'm nervous.

01:00.210 --> 01:02.286
This is the only woman
I've ever had a crush on.

01:02.288 --> 01:03.954
- What about Mrs. Claus?

01:03.956 --> 01:05.138
- I was six.

01:05.291 --> 01:07.066
- Why do you care so much
about Mia?

01:07.142 --> 01:09.142
So she's got a nose ring.
Big whoop.

01:09.219 --> 01:12.720
- She's nice. She's smart.
She's got a nose ring.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.981
I don't know. I just need
everything to be perfect.

01:15.058 --> 01:16.133
[door clicks open]

01:16.151 --> 01:20.329
- Guess who fell
into a septic tank.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.169
- [screams]
Baby alligator.

01:28.238 --> 01:30.981
[doorbell rings]
- Oh, she's here.

01:30.999 --> 01:32.407
- Hurry, Jack,
shake yourself dry.

01:32.484 --> 01:36.503
- [blubbers]
- Good boy.

01:36.580 --> 01:39.172
- [panting]

01:39.325 --> 01:41.100
Oh, Mia, forgot
you were coming over.

01:41.176 --> 01:42.326
[grunts]

01:42.469 --> 01:44.419
No, no, I'm just kidding.
Please don't leave.

01:44.496 --> 01:45.938
- Hey, Duncan, my parents said

01:46.089 --> 01:47.681
to give this to your parents
for having me over.

01:47.833 --> 01:49.850
I think they just wanted
to prove they own wine.

01:50.002 --> 01:55.005
- Um, make yourself at my home
in the house where I live.

01:55.007 --> 01:57.783
- Oh, someone has a crush
on Santa's wife.

01:57.934 --> 01:59.952
- [grunts]
She meant nothing.

02:00.028 --> 02:02.979
- So, Mia, Duncan tells me
you move a lot.

02:02.981 --> 02:03.956
What are you hiding from?

02:04.032 --> 02:05.866
- Have I ever done
anything to you?

02:05.942 --> 02:08.201
- Duncan's an amazing person.

02:08.354 --> 02:11.130
And if you hurt him,
you'll have me to deal with.

02:11.206 --> 02:12.706
- I'm just here
to watch a movie.

02:12.782 --> 02:14.282
- Yeah.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.968
[grunts]

02:16.044 --> 02:17.803
- Maybe I won't freeze my eggs.

02:17.954 --> 02:20.121
- I heated pizza rolls.

02:20.141 --> 02:22.141
Take your pick:
ice cold or scalding hot.

02:22.292 --> 02:23.458
- Try one, Mia.

02:23.627 --> 02:26.203
They're like little egg rolls
with pizza inside.

02:26.221 --> 02:28.981
- Yes, I've had them before.
- Have you?

02:29.057 --> 02:32.058
Oh, Dunkie, I like this one.

02:32.135 --> 02:33.226
- All right, so for anyone
who's not caught up

02:33.379 --> 02:34.802
on the "Teen Housewives"
cinematic universe,

02:34.880 --> 02:36.989
Brandon is married to Braeyln,
who's dating Tylan,

02:37.065 --> 02:38.565
who used to be married
to Brendell,

02:38.717 --> 02:40.400
and Tamden hates this.

02:40.477 --> 02:41.401
- And tonight we find out

02:41.553 --> 02:43.737
which grandma's
gonna raise the baby.

02:43.813 --> 02:46.331
- My money's on Grandma Debbie.

02:46.483 --> 02:48.333
Oh, my God!

02:48.410 --> 02:50.335
- And without further ado,
I give you

02:50.412 --> 02:52.229
"Teen Housewives: The Movie."

02:52.231 --> 02:53.988
- Grandma Debbie,
Grandma Brittany,

02:54.008 --> 02:57.176
Stepgrandma Lindsey P,
Stepgrandma Lindsey C,

02:57.327 --> 02:58.677
<i> tonight one of you</i>
<i> will be chosen to do</i>

02:58.828 --> 03:00.679
<i> what you said you never would:</i>

03:00.906 --> 03:03.073
<i> raise my baby.</i>

03:03.075 --> 03:04.257
<i> - I hate this.</i>

03:04.351 --> 03:07.168
- It's so exciting.
They're all equally unfit.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.095
<i> - The person</i>
<i> who will be raising</i>

03:09.172 --> 03:12.191
<i> my and Tylan's baby is...</i>

03:12.267 --> 03:15.009
<i> - Are you tired of walking</i>
<i> on hardwood floors?</i>

03:15.029 --> 03:17.845
<i> - Ow!</i>
<i> - Or c-c-c-cold tile?</i>

03:17.923 --> 03:19.013
<i> - Brr!</i>

03:19.033 --> 03:20.774
- Aah! What's happening?

03:20.926 --> 03:22.426
- Where did movie go?

03:22.428 --> 03:24.686
- Calm down, kids.
It's just a commercial.

03:24.763 --> 03:28.749
They either have to run these
or do subtle product placement.

03:29.859 --> 03:31.952
Ah, the San Francisco treat.

03:32.028 --> 03:33.212
- It's Disney Plus.

03:33.363 --> 03:34.454
There's not supposed
to be commercials.

03:34.606 --> 03:37.532
- Actually, I got us
the ad-supported model,

03:37.534 --> 03:38.608
Disney Minus.

03:38.610 --> 03:39.867
It's cheaper.
- Ugh.

03:39.945 --> 03:42.370
Mia, I am so sorry
you had to see this.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.039
<i> - Then get on Route 17</i>
<i> and get to Oakdale's</i>

03:45.117 --> 03:48.042
<i> leading carpet dealer,</i>
<i> The Ruglord.</i>

03:48.120 --> 03:51.730
<i> - Say hello</i>
<i> to my little prices.</i>

03:51.881 --> 03:55.625
<i> [yelling]</i>
<i> [gunfire]</i>

03:55.627 --> 03:56.977
- This guy is so lame.

03:57.053 --> 03:59.296
He doesn't make me
wanna buy a carpet at all.

03:59.298 --> 04:01.481
- Actually, I deliver
pizzas to him.

04:01.558 --> 04:02.799
He's super rich.

04:02.801 --> 04:04.801
- We get pizza
and we're not super rich.

04:04.803 --> 04:08.805
- Do you get cinnamon sticks
and a side of frosting?

04:08.824 --> 04:10.398
all: Whoa!

04:10.400 --> 04:11.566
- Frosting?

04:11.585 --> 04:14.253
Dad, why can't we be rich
like The Ruglord?

04:14.329 --> 04:16.146
I bet he has Disney Plus.

04:16.164 --> 04:17.923
- We're doing just fine,
Duncan.

04:18.116 --> 04:20.074
Mia, the plumbing business
is cyclical.

04:20.094 --> 04:21.242
- That's okay, Mr. Harris.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.910
You don't have
to explain to me.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.004
- I feel like I do.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.322
If you're gonna marry Duncan,

04:25.340 --> 04:27.657
you need to know
he's not a wealthy boy

04:27.659 --> 04:30.251
pretending to be poor
to see if you really love him.

04:30.329 --> 04:32.253
- Again, just here
to watch a movie.

04:32.331 --> 04:34.439
- Dad, if you did a commercial
like The Ruglord,

04:34.549 --> 04:36.924
you'd be rich and our lives
would change forever.

04:37.002 --> 04:39.761
- Duncan, your father works
his butt off for this family.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.507
And yes, it doesn't
add up to money and things,

04:43.525 --> 04:44.950
but there's lot of ways
people can be rich.

04:45.177 --> 04:46.618
Don't you agree, Mia?

04:46.695 --> 04:48.028
- Oh, I'm still a part of this?

04:48.122 --> 04:51.531
Sure, yeah, uh, you can be rich
in family and in health.

04:51.683 --> 04:54.351
But The Ruglord's house
has a bowling alley.

04:54.369 --> 04:56.778
I'm not normally impressed
by shallow extravagance,

04:56.797 --> 05:00.690
but bowling from the comfort
of your own home...

05:00.709 --> 05:02.283
[sighs]

05:02.361 --> 05:04.619
- Dad, please make
a lame-ass commercial.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.712
I'll even help you.

05:05.864 --> 05:07.697
- You'd do that for me, son?

05:07.699 --> 05:08.974
- Sure.
Just for you, nobody else.

05:09.125 --> 05:11.310
- I don't know.
Commercial acting is hard.

05:11.495 --> 05:14.220
Geico's gone through
so many geckos.

05:14.297 --> 05:16.631
<i> - First you get</i>
<i> the carpet pad.</i>

05:16.650 --> 05:18.058
<i> Then you get the carpet.</i>

05:18.134 --> 05:20.877
<i> Then you get the warranty.</i>

05:20.879 --> 05:22.136
- On the other hand,

05:22.230 --> 05:24.573
it would be fun to sit
in a bathtub full of rugs.

05:27.703 --> 05:28.643
- Jack, I don't wanna say,

05:28.720 --> 05:30.554
"My bridge club
is coming over."

05:30.556 --> 05:32.906
Can't I be
a more contemporary woman?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.391
- I've been living
with these characters

05:34.393 --> 05:36.651
since I wrote the script
over breakfast.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.061
You've got to trust me.

05:38.063 --> 05:39.004
- Settle, everyone.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.322
You paid for five minutes
of studio time,

05:41.342 --> 05:43.157
and by the time I'm done
saying this, it'll be four.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.417
Places and action.

05:44.570 --> 05:45.993
- Oh, no.

05:46.071 --> 05:51.165
My bridge club is coming over,
and my toilet won't flush.

05:51.185 --> 05:54.594
- That's because you called
those other guys.

05:54.746 --> 05:55.687
- Glug, glug, glug.

05:55.764 --> 05:58.081
- Did you try plugging it in?

05:58.100 --> 06:01.101
- I'm drunk and you're
paying for it. [burps]

06:01.253 --> 06:03.511
- Step aside,
traditional homemaker,

06:03.589 --> 06:07.181
and let Cap'n Clog
save the day.

06:07.259 --> 06:11.185
This looks like the work
of The Gunkwad.

06:11.205 --> 06:14.355
- Not The Gunkwad!

06:14.433 --> 06:15.765
- Yeah, I'm not doing this.

06:15.784 --> 06:17.692
- Cut.
- Why not?

06:17.769 --> 06:19.269
- I'm a piece of poop.

06:19.271 --> 06:20.695
- You're not poop, honey.

06:20.772 --> 06:22.122
You're an amalgamation

06:22.198 --> 06:25.291
of all the gunk
that wads in people's pipes:

06:25.368 --> 06:28.945
hair, keys, goldfish,
criminal evidence,

06:28.964 --> 06:30.630
and those little
belly button nubs

06:30.782 --> 06:32.057
that fall off newborns.

06:32.134 --> 06:34.542
- All stuck
to a giant piece of poop.

06:34.636 --> 06:36.544
- 90 seconds and I've got
Rudy the Rat Killer coming in.

06:36.622 --> 06:38.045
Let's go. Come on.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.624
- Red leather, yellow leather,
red leather, yellow leather.

06:40.626 --> 06:43.293
- Duncan, this was your idea
because your night with Mia

06:43.295 --> 06:44.811
wasn't dope as hell.

06:44.888 --> 06:46.296
Do you want me
to be more successful?

06:46.298 --> 06:47.722
Or we can just go back
to living

06:47.741 --> 06:49.482
our happy and humble life.

06:49.635 --> 06:50.391
<i> [harp glissando]</i>

06:50.393 --> 06:52.152
- Welcome home, Mrs. Harris.

06:52.228 --> 06:54.971
- We're living in the camper?
Where do we shower?

06:54.990 --> 06:57.064
- Oh, we just use
the watering can.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.808
- It's not so bad
once you get used to it.

06:58.902 --> 07:00.735
- I will never
get used to this.

07:00.829 --> 07:01.920
- I'm leaving you, Duncan.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.813
The Ruglord has a teenage son,

07:03.832 --> 07:06.800
and he invited me
house bowling.

07:07.911 --> 07:11.337
- Why didn't I do
Dad's commercial?

07:11.490 --> 07:14.324
- All right, now turn over
so I can wash your butts.

07:14.417 --> 07:16.918
- Uh, may I be excused
from this fantasy?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.161
<i> [harp glissando]</i>

07:18.180 --> 07:20.847
- Let's film
a local commercial.

07:20.999 --> 07:23.833
- Not The Gunkwad!

07:23.852 --> 07:26.686
- Cap'n Clog,
nice to see poo.

07:26.763 --> 07:29.448
- Gunkwad, we meet again.

07:29.599 --> 07:30.932
- In the flush.

07:31.009 --> 07:32.433
- [grunts]

07:32.453 --> 07:36.696
- Ooh, curse you, Clog,
and your reasonable prices.

07:36.773 --> 07:39.349
[screams]
[toilet flushes]

07:39.351 --> 07:42.519
- How can I ever
repay you, Cap'n?

07:42.521 --> 07:44.370
- Venmo.

07:44.523 --> 07:48.783
That is the best thing
we have ever done as a family.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.117
- So when do we start
getting rich?

07:50.195 --> 07:51.953
- You gotta be patient, son.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.454
A good ad campaign
takes a long--

07:53.532 --> 07:54.881
[phone rings]
Harris Plumbing.

07:54.958 --> 07:57.050
Yes, I'm the guy
that defeated Gunkwad.

07:57.126 --> 07:59.035
Of course I can fit you in
tomorrow.

07:59.037 --> 08:00.870
- That depends.
Is your garbage disposal

08:00.872 --> 08:02.964
making a grr-rr-rr-rr

08:03.041 --> 08:05.725
or a g-glunk, g-glunk, g-glunk?

08:05.877 --> 08:08.636
- Oh, Oscar, the whole can?

08:08.655 --> 08:10.396
No wonder you're a grouch.

08:10.549 --> 08:11.698
How's 2:00?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.721
- Oh, yeah, that's it.

08:17.814 --> 08:20.390
Put me on the naughty list,
Mrs. Claus.

08:20.392 --> 08:22.075
- Time for work, Gunkwad.

08:22.227 --> 08:24.819
- Work? But we had a deal.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.671
You make the money,
and I spend it.

08:26.748 --> 08:28.064
- Everyone loves
your commercial

08:28.066 --> 08:29.508
and is goo-goo for Gunkwad.

08:29.659 --> 08:30.825
They all wanna meet him.

08:30.919 --> 08:32.660
- You're not only the face
of this company now.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.087
You're my son and my partner,

08:34.239 --> 08:35.847
and I could not be more proud.

08:35.999 --> 08:37.665
- Now go put on your poop suit.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.518
- It's an amalgamation.

08:39.594 --> 08:42.145
- Sure, it is, honey.

- You're pushing it, fella.

17:14.108 --> 17:16.350
- Mia's not responding
to my texts.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.703
I'm pouring my heart out here.

17:18.780 --> 17:20.112
- Don't worry.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.598
All will be forgiven when
this next commercial blows up.

17:22.617 --> 17:26.360
You know how the song goes.
Mo' money, less problems.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.454
- Are you sure we haven't
turned into jerks?

17:28.531 --> 17:30.697
- Absolutely not.

17:30.775 --> 17:33.943
You saw me coming!

17:33.945 --> 17:37.613
- Say hello
to my little prices.

17:37.615 --> 17:39.039
- And cut.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.726
That's a wrap on Ruglord.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.378
- Whoa, Ruglord.

17:44.455 --> 17:47.790
- Gunkwad, I am such a fan.

17:47.809 --> 17:50.234
- And I'm Cap'n Clog.
- Okay.

17:50.311 --> 17:52.219
- Ruglord, can I ask you
something?

17:52.297 --> 17:55.147
How do you balance work
and relationships?

17:55.300 --> 17:58.725
- Also, how do you make it look
like the rug is firing bullets?

17:58.803 --> 17:59.893
- Oh, the rug is easy.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.080
I have real machine gun
inside of it.

18:02.307 --> 18:04.807
But I fail miserably
at relationships.

18:04.826 --> 18:07.159
Being The Ruglord
cost me my wife,

18:07.236 --> 18:09.478
my girlfriend,
and my side piece.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.164
- But you're famous
and make so much money.

18:12.317 --> 18:15.318
We've heard about
the cinnamon sticks.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.503
- There are only so many
cinnamon sticks

18:17.655 --> 18:19.263
a man can eat alone.

18:20.916 --> 18:23.750
Hey, are you guys
doing anything tonight?

18:23.770 --> 18:26.162
I have a bowling alley
in my house.

18:26.164 --> 18:29.014
We can type funny names in
like we're good friends.

18:29.016 --> 18:30.757
both:
Oh, jeez, tonight?

18:30.819 --> 18:31.851
- No, yeah, sorry, man.
- Oh, shoot.

18:31.927 --> 18:33.502
- Gunkwad, Cap'n Clog
to the set.

18:33.504 --> 18:35.338
- Oh, thank God.

18:35.431 --> 18:39.033
- Looks like it's just you
and me, Shaggy.

18:41.103 --> 18:43.788
<i> - And the person I want</i>
<i> to raise my baby is...</i>

18:43.865 --> 18:45.123
<i> Grandma Brittany.</i>

18:45.199 --> 18:48.292
<i> - I can't,</i>
<i> because I'm pregnant.</i>

18:48.444 --> 18:50.611
- Aw, she wasn't throwing up
from the vodka.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.037
It was morning sickness.

18:52.190 --> 18:54.114
- I shouldn't be watching this.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.282
- Pause it, pause it, pause it.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.526
Annie, you gotta see
our new commercial.

18:57.528 --> 18:58.878
Gunkwad dies.

18:58.954 --> 19:00.454
Or does he?

19:00.473 --> 19:01.380
Sit, sit, sit.

19:01.457 --> 19:04.124
[doorbell rings]
- [panting]

19:04.202 --> 19:05.143
- Pizza for you.

19:05.294 --> 19:06.702
- Oh, would you mind
putting it

19:06.721 --> 19:08.128
on the coffee table?

19:08.148 --> 19:12.400
- You're lucky it's policy
that if you ask, I have to.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.989
<i> - Any last words, Gunkwad,</i>

19:18.140 --> 19:21.159
<i> before I send you</i>
<i> to Satan's toilet?</i>

19:21.310 --> 19:22.994
<i> - I just have one thing</i>
<i> to say.</i>

19:23.221 --> 19:25.329
<i> Mia...</i>
- Hmm?

19:25.481 --> 19:28.073
<i> - I got so caught up</i>
<i> on playing a giant turd on TV,</i>

19:28.150 --> 19:29.725
<i> I became one in real life.</i>

19:29.727 --> 19:30.835
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

19:30.986 --> 19:33.004
<i> All I wanted to do</i>
<i> was impress you</i>

19:33.231 --> 19:34.747
<i> and maybe get</i>
<i> to hold your hand,</i>

19:34.899 --> 19:36.007
<i> or you could hold my hand,</i>

19:36.158 --> 19:38.067
<i> or I don't know,</i>
<i> anything with our hands.</i>

19:38.069 --> 19:41.053
<i> But no, not that. Ugh.</i>
<i> Can I do another take?</i>

19:45.852 --> 19:47.685
- Mia's an amazing person.

19:47.836 --> 19:51.189
And if you hurt her,
you'll have me to deal with.

19:51.340 --> 19:53.357
- And I just wanna go back
to the way things were,

19:53.584 --> 19:55.193
with me barely providing
for our family

19:55.344 --> 19:58.345
and using our Mapplebee's
coupons on Tuesday nights.

19:58.364 --> 20:02.700
- Oh, Jackie,
you financially reckless fool.

20:02.777 --> 20:05.277
- Promise you'll never try
to impress me again,

20:05.354 --> 20:06.445
'cause when you do,

20:06.689 --> 20:09.098
you do it in really weird
and off-putting ways.

20:09.158 --> 20:12.785
- Don't worry.
My days as The Wad are over.

20:12.861 --> 20:15.296
Goodbye, gross costume.

20:18.367 --> 20:23.279
- The fumes are having a...
delightful effect.

20:23.297 --> 20:26.373
- I don't think
I should be inhaling this.

20:26.451 --> 20:27.558
- Anybody else feeling like

20:27.710 --> 20:30.453
you don't give
a rat's ass about anything?

20:30.471 --> 20:34.214
- I sure don't care about that
$3,000 bill from Mapplebee's.

20:34.292 --> 20:36.567
Mapplebee's.
That's a funny name, isn't it?

20:36.644 --> 20:39.070
Mapplebee's.

20:39.297 --> 20:41.480
- You guys are crazy.
I don't feel anything.

20:41.632 --> 20:42.481
- [grunts]

20:42.558 --> 20:44.242
Which one of you is Duncan?

20:44.351 --> 20:45.076
- [yelps]

20:45.394 --> 20:47.578
- Kris, stop it.
Nothing happened.

20:47.730 --> 20:50.473
- Mary, you haven't aged a day.

20:50.491 --> 20:51.707
[gun cocking]

20:54.737 --> 20:55.920
[all cheering]

20:55.997 --> 20:58.089
- This is awesome!

20:58.165 --> 21:00.591
I can feel the wind
in my cavities.

21:00.668 --> 21:03.319
- Duncan, you are
my boat friend--best friend.

21:03.337 --> 21:05.245
Nope, I'm going back
to boat friend.

21:05.323 --> 21:07.323
- This baby really handles
the chop.

21:07.325 --> 21:09.825
[tires screeching]
Whoa, why'd we stop?

21:09.827 --> 21:11.251
- End of the line.

21:11.271 --> 21:14.789
- Can't we just drive to Miami
and shoot a rap video?

21:14.865 --> 21:17.866
- Yeah, Mavis and I
haven't used our parasail yet.

21:17.868 --> 21:19.518
- Sorry, I got
better things to do

21:19.595 --> 21:21.261
than drive a bunch of kids
around.

21:21.339 --> 21:23.781
- You know,
he used to be Gunkwad.

21:23.932 --> 21:25.116
- Gunkwad?

21:25.267 --> 21:26.933
Hang on, kids.
We're catching the freeway.

21:26.953 --> 21:30.705
[all cheering]
