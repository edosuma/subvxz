WEBVTT

00:06.983 --> 00:08.453
Previously on E.R.

00:08.454 --> 00:11.261
Jen is really pushing it.
She's having an affair...

00:11.262 --> 00:13.659
...and I have to give up
my daughter at Christmas.

00:13.660 --> 00:14.693
Loretta, right?

00:14.693 --> 00:17.438
Looks like the old PID shuffle.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.676
Doctor, help her.

00:19.708 --> 00:22.413
You have a choice
of a new surgical technique.

00:22.514 --> 00:26.359
Developed by one of the top vascular
surgeons in the country. He works here.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.431
Okay, where do I sign?

00:28.432 --> 00:29.679
She's obviously high risk.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.878
- Has she consented?
- She's being prepped right now.

00:31.979 --> 00:33.388
Maybe I'm not gonna help for this.

00:33.945 --> 00:36.134
I guess it's your
first Christmas alone too.

00:37.972 --> 00:40.860
"Dead of Winter"

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.356 --> 00:51.357
Yeah.

00:53.984 --> 00:56.236
We'll take care of it.
What's your ETA?

00:56.402 --> 00:57.820
Okay, no problem.

00:57.987 --> 00:59.780
- Where's Dr. Lewis?
- Suture Room.

00:59.947 --> 01:03.699
Baby coming in, respiratory arrest.
Five minutes out.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.794
Susan? Susan?

01:21.088 --> 01:22.755
Turn off the overheads, would you?

01:22.964 --> 01:25.299
- We've got an unresponsive infant.
- The lights?

01:25.466 --> 01:28.134
- They'll be here soon.
- Okay.

01:28.301 --> 01:30.636
- You up? You sure?
- Yeah.

01:36.891 --> 01:39.601
- Susan?
- Yeah. I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.

02:17.963 --> 02:21.257
Top on, lock it in again...

02:26.219 --> 02:28.095
- This is Melody.
- Melody?

02:28.262 --> 02:31.140
Those Indians,
were they pretty close behind you?

02:31.306 --> 02:33.641
No! You 're wrong, Dr. Welby.

02:34.225 --> 02:36.935
- Now, Dean's going to recover.
- Yes, she will recover.

02:37.102 --> 02:39.770
But you must be aware
that there was damage.

02:39.937 --> 02:42.898
The damage can be corrected.
Dean has always been strong.

02:43.064 --> 02:46.443
I know what she can do.
She's gonna make a full recovery.

02:46.609 --> 02:48.318
I'll make sure of that.

03:03.663 --> 03:05.999
- You used to like her.
- No, I didn't.

03:06.165 --> 03:10.501
Yeah, you did. Before Rodman,
you talked about her all the time.

03:10.668 --> 03:14.254
- What have you got, sarge?
- Responded to a domestic-violence call.

03:14.421 --> 03:18.132
He was in the street, buck-naked,
waving a gun and screaming.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.468
- You'll need a light.
- Did he shoot someone?

03:20.634 --> 03:24.471
No, he ran inside, slipped
on the stairs and passed out, drunk.

03:25.721 --> 03:31.392
You better not have dragged us from
a warm firehouse to check a drunk.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.894
Bunch of jelly-doughnut-eating pendejos.

03:35.353 --> 03:37.396
Hey, Dumb and Dumber!

03:37.563 --> 03:40.691
Nobody got you out of bed
for that piece of crap.

03:42.859 --> 03:47.529
- I got you out of bed for them.
- Holy Mary, Mother of God!

03:56.535 --> 03:59.038
Welcome to Calcutta.

05:04.419 --> 05:07.463
Twenty-two children, ages 6 months
to 9 and a half years...

05:07.630 --> 05:09.798
...found in a single apartment
on Calumet.

05:09.965 --> 05:14.176
Malnutrition, suspect marasmus,
kwashiorkor, who knows what else.

05:14.343 --> 05:16.845
Northwestern took four, Mercy three,
we got the rest.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.513
- Parents?
- Nobody knows.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.682
- Children and Family Services?
- On the way.

05:20.848 --> 05:24.101
The cops took the kids and arrested
the guy who says he's the uncle.

05:24.267 --> 05:27.436
- Of all of them?
- So he says. I've got a toddler in 2.

05:27.603 --> 05:30.021
- How many have you seen so far?
- Four of them.

05:30.188 --> 05:33.982
Thrush, chronic otitis media,
ringworm, diarrhea...

05:34.149 --> 05:36.859
...malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances.

05:37.026 --> 05:41.363
Let's get a CBC, Chem-20, protein,
albumin, transferrin...

05:41.530 --> 05:45.491
...globulins, iron, UA
and a folate level.

05:46.117 --> 05:48.076
Doug, that baby's refusing formula.

05:48.243 --> 05:51.705
Drop a feeding tube.
Thirteen pounds, maybe a year old.

05:52.705 --> 05:56.249
- Who's this?
- Can't get a name. Says she's 3.

05:56.416 --> 05:57.917
You're 3, sweetheart?

05:58.084 --> 06:02.379
What's your name, darling?
Come on, what's your name?

06:02.546 --> 06:06.841
Let's get these sores cleaned up.
Start her on Keflex, 250 mgs.

06:07.007 --> 06:11.176
Looks like impetigo.
Let's hope the others haven't caught it.

06:11.385 --> 06:12.761
Chem-20, CBC, UA?

06:12.928 --> 06:16.389
Yeah, and let's get height,
weight, head and arm circumferences.

06:16.556 --> 06:20.058
- I'm gonna go make myself useful.
- Okay.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.313
- Last three.
- We got the beds?

06:26.480 --> 06:27.814
Suture Room.

06:27.981 --> 06:30.316
- I'm Dr. Greene. What's your name?
- Ty.

06:30.482 --> 06:33.694
- Are these your brothers and sisters?
- Some.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.945
- Who are the others?
- I don't know. Cousins.

06:36.195 --> 06:40.490
- You know their names? A few?
- Some.

06:40.657 --> 06:43.325
Right. Some.

06:43.492 --> 06:47.328
- Lydia, why don't you find Ty a bed.
- Come on, Ty.

06:50.956 --> 06:53.499
- Where's his shoes?
- Couldn't find them.

06:53.666 --> 06:57.502
Looked over the whole place.
There were only clothes for half the kids.

06:57.669 --> 07:02.047
Rubadoux. Would you excuse us
for a moment, Mr. Rubadoux?

07:02.214 --> 07:04.467
- Sure.
- Thank you.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.137
- Dr. Benton?
- Post-op, day nine.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.930
Patient presented with
type A aortic dissection...

07:13.097 --> 07:15.057
...repaired with
clamp-and-run procedure.

07:15.224 --> 07:17.267
Patient's surgical course
was unremarkable.

07:17.434 --> 07:20.519
There's evidence of partial
paraplegia of the lower extremities.

07:20.686 --> 07:23.814
- And this morning?
- Echo shows ejection of 15 percent.

07:23.981 --> 07:27.859
BUN's 45. Creatinine, 2.
BP's 180/110.

07:28.026 --> 07:30.569
- Suggesting what?
- Heart failure, renal insufficiency.

07:30.736 --> 07:34.697
None of this attributable to our
lifesaving, aortic-aneurysm surgery.

07:34.864 --> 07:37.240
I'm worried about her paraplegia.

07:37.407 --> 07:40.451
It's too soon to say if it's not temporary.
Course of action?

07:40.618 --> 07:44.120
Increase cardiac output so we can
send her to a long-term care facility.

07:44.287 --> 07:47.248
Get her off our service. Exactly. How?

07:47.414 --> 07:49.625
Given her condition,
I'd suggest dobutamine IV.

07:49.791 --> 07:52.501
They wouldn't accept her
in a nursing home with an IV.

07:53.002 --> 07:56.171
Anybody else? Mr. Carter, a thought?

07:56.338 --> 07:58.715
On dobutamine,
she'll be better for a few days...

07:58.882 --> 08:02.635
...but she'll decompensate and come
back here. Maybe an ACE inhibitor?

08:02.801 --> 08:05.220
- We could do that.
- Worsens her renal problem.

08:05.386 --> 08:06.762
- Carter?
- Nitrates.

08:06.929 --> 08:08.263
Decreases her preload.

08:08.430 --> 08:09.765
- Digoxin?
- Kidneys can't clear it.

08:09.932 --> 08:12.141
- Diuretics?
- Decreases her cardiac output.

08:12.308 --> 08:14.476
- Quite the conundrum.
- There's a solution.

08:14.643 --> 08:19.605
A pinch of this, a touch of that.
We have to use our clinical judgment.

08:22.774 --> 08:26.234
- How many are you carrying?
- Five, but I can handle another one.

08:26.401 --> 08:31.113
Show us what you can do without
resorting to Dr. Benton's dobutamine.

08:31.280 --> 08:34.573
Amaze us. Impress us.
Work miracles.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.998
Bad case of ringworm...
Well, with kerion...

08:45.374 --> 08:48.710
Let's get him on oral griseofulvin.
Open up.

08:50.127 --> 08:52.338
- Ty, you had enough to eat?
- Yeah.

08:52.505 --> 08:55.215
- Yeah. Like what?
- We eat stuff.

08:55.382 --> 09:00.552
- Fruits? Vegetables? Meat?
- Sometimes.

09:00.718 --> 09:02.929
What about the babies?
They get formula?

09:03.096 --> 09:06.431
Mom gives me the stamps when
she don't need them, and I get us stuff.

09:06.598 --> 09:08.974
Milk for the babies, bologna, bread.

09:09.141 --> 09:12.394
- You do the shopping?
- I'm good at it.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.812
Trey okay?

09:13.978 --> 09:17.064
- Is he one of your brothers?
- I look after him. He's sick.

09:17.231 --> 09:18.982
- How sick?
- Cerebral palsy.

09:19.149 --> 09:23.735
- Your brother has cerebral palsy?
- He's in Trauma 1. Doug's checking him.

09:23.902 --> 09:29.323
CBC, Chem-20, protein studies,
transferrin, iron and UA.

09:29.490 --> 09:33.576
Let's call a dental school and get some
students to take a look at the kids.

09:34.285 --> 09:36.995
And I'm gonna go see
how your brother Trey's doing, okay?

09:42.250 --> 09:44.167
- Where's Doug?
- Trauma 1.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.336
- How's she doing?
- Anemia, neutropenic, thrush...

09:47.503 --> 09:49.713
...chronic otitis media and pediculosis.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.048
- Lice?
- You bet you. And if she's got them...

09:52.215 --> 09:56.135
They've all got them. Grab a basin,
RID and start shampooing.

09:56.301 --> 09:58.970
- All of them?
- It's great to be the new kid, isn't it?

09:59.137 --> 10:01.931
- Susan, weren't you off at 7?
- Yeah. Jeanie too.

10:02.098 --> 10:05.142
I've got a performance review
this afternoon. I'll stick around.

10:05.308 --> 10:06.642
Come on, lice patrol.

10:06.809 --> 10:09.978
- Isn't that a nurse's job?
- No, not today, it isn't.

10:10.812 --> 10:13.815
Finish this one and go home.
We've got it.

10:13.981 --> 10:17.234
I signed them in.
I wanna make sure they're okay.

10:19.944 --> 10:21.611
Let me see that.

10:21.778 --> 10:24.573
- Is this the kid with CP?
- Yeah.

10:24.739 --> 10:27.116
Five years old, weighs 28 pounds.

10:27.658 --> 10:32.495
Lethargic. Slight abdominal edema.
Kid's starving to death. Take a look.

10:32.662 --> 10:35.080
Look at that.

10:35.247 --> 10:37.331
- Cigarette burn?
- Yeah. Welts too.

10:41.751 --> 10:44.045
You're gonna have to bring him in.

10:44.212 --> 10:46.088
Who paged me down from rounds?

10:46.255 --> 10:49.632
- If I got shot, I'd come to the hospital.
- This better be important.

10:49.799 --> 10:54.178
Look, lady, I'm not talking to him.
I'm a clerk, not a priest.

10:54.344 --> 10:57.346
Call 911 or get on the damn bus.

10:57.513 --> 11:00.016
- The page?
- How should I know? Ask around.

11:00.182 --> 11:03.018
Dr. Benton?
Al Boulet, Jeanie's husband.

11:04.810 --> 11:07.979
- Oh, yeah. How are you doing?
- Been better. Have you seen her?

11:08.146 --> 11:12.357
- No. Is she working?
- She's meeting me for breakfast.

11:13.317 --> 11:17.778
Do me a favor. If you see her,
tell her I'm looking for her, okay?

11:19.529 --> 11:23.616
Find out who paged me and tell them
to be here the next time I come.

11:24.992 --> 11:29.203
- What was that all about?
- Dr. Personality? Who knows?

11:29.370 --> 11:32.205
Anybody seen a DCFS around here?

11:32.372 --> 11:35.207
Mark Greene? Dr. Mark Greene?

11:36.334 --> 11:38.419
- You Child Services?
- Sorry, no.

11:38.586 --> 11:41.838
Process server. Sign here, please.

11:42.005 --> 11:45.049
- What for?
- Summons. Third line, please.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.263
- Have a nice day.
- Right.

11:55.890 --> 11:59.351
- Patient?
- Hope not.

12:02.227 --> 12:06.064
- Jennifer's suing me for divorce.
- Oh, no.

12:07.774 --> 12:10.984
- You Dr. Greene?
- Not if you want me to sign anything.

12:11.151 --> 12:13.236
- What?
- I'm Mark Greene.

12:13.402 --> 12:15.571
Pete Tuteur. DCFS.

12:15.738 --> 12:17.656
I understand you've got
some kids for us.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.538
A little more water.

12:30.374 --> 12:34.585
- Okay.
- That wasn't so bad, was it?

12:35.211 --> 12:39.005
- Got another one for you.
- Alrighty.

12:39.172 --> 12:43.258
Hi, there, sweet pea.
I'm Jeanie, do you have a name?

12:43.425 --> 12:44.842
That one doesn't talk.

12:46.552 --> 12:51.264
Okay, we're gonna shampoo your hair
and make it look all beautiful.

12:51.431 --> 12:52.973
Is that too hot?

12:53.641 --> 12:55.809
Is that too cold?

12:56.976 --> 12:58.478
Must be just right, then.

12:58.645 --> 13:01.146
- How many more?
- You've done eight?

13:01.313 --> 13:05.108
Nine, I think. What's that, sweetie?
Did you say something?

13:06.234 --> 13:09.111
I didn't hear what you said.
I was talking to my friends.

13:09.277 --> 13:13.155
Will you be my mommy?

13:26.915 --> 13:29.000
- Where's the husband?
- Cafeteria.

13:29.167 --> 13:31.627
- Renal or Cardiology been up yet?
- Yeah.

13:31.794 --> 13:33.838
- And?
- Renal wants to use hydralazine.

13:34.004 --> 13:35.672
Cardiology wants an ACE inhibitor.

13:35.839 --> 13:39.758
The Renal/Cardiology push-and-pull.
And Pulmonary?

13:39.925 --> 13:44.345
- They sent an incentive spirometer.
- That should solve all her problems.

13:44.512 --> 13:47.180
- Partial paraplegia?
- Still present.

13:49.807 --> 13:52.685
- You know your beeper's going off.
- I'm not deaf, Carter.

13:52.852 --> 13:56.896
All right. Well, hurry up.
Do something. Time's wasting.

13:58.105 --> 14:00.774
Forty milligrams IV push of Lasix, please.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.860
- Won't that volume deplete her?
- Just do it, please.

14:04.026 --> 14:06.444
Sorry, but...

14:11.657 --> 14:14.367
Three girls aren't supposed to
be living with the mother.

14:14.534 --> 14:17.411
Grandmother's got the custody.
God knows where she is.

14:17.578 --> 14:22.790
- Why were they all in one apartment?
- Twenty-two AFDC payments.

14:22.999 --> 14:25.792
Uncle's on disability.
The rent's maybe 300.

14:25.959 --> 14:28.502
Hell, they're netting 4 grand
a month for crack.

14:29.211 --> 14:30.588
Your tax dollars at work.

14:30.754 --> 14:33.089
Sounds like a press release
for welfare reform.

14:33.256 --> 14:35.049
That's all we need.

14:35.216 --> 14:38.468
Less money trickling down to keep
these kids from starving to death.

14:38.635 --> 14:42.680
When the kids are cleaned up,
I'll take them to Columbus/Maryville.

14:42.847 --> 14:46.016
They're malnourished, dehydrated,
electrolytes are screwed up...

14:46.183 --> 14:49.685
...and they've got infections.
They'll leave when they're okay.

14:49.852 --> 14:52.562
Fine by me. We haven't
got anywhere to put them.

14:52.729 --> 14:56.398
- Seen Benton? I keep paging him.
- He's around.

14:56.565 --> 14:58.817
Ever get the feeling
the system isn't working?

14:58.983 --> 15:01.694
You're just figuring that one out?

15:01.861 --> 15:04.779
One boy has an inguinal mass.
He needs a surgical consult.

15:04.946 --> 15:08.282
- Reducible?
- Yeah, but it's there when he's crying.

15:08.449 --> 15:11.701
He's crying a lot. None of the kids
have ever seen doctors.

15:11.868 --> 15:13.995
- She had me served at work.
- Jennifer?

15:14.162 --> 15:16.997
I'd hoped we were gonna be able
to handle this amicably.

15:17.164 --> 15:21.292
- Guess this blows that one to hell.
- I'm gonna need a good attorney.

15:21.459 --> 15:23.627
Come over tonight. We'll order a pizza.

15:23.793 --> 15:27.504
You can watch me give Susie a bath,
and you could change a diaper.

15:27.671 --> 15:31.841
- I'm gonna go and wallow in self-pity.
- Anytime.

15:34.551 --> 15:37.012
- They find homes for the kids yet?
- Not yet.

15:37.179 --> 15:41.514
DCFS took some to the emergency
shelter, and we admitted three.

15:41.681 --> 15:44.976
- Want anything from the machines?
- Peanut butter crackers.

15:45.143 --> 15:46.560
Got it.

15:47.686 --> 15:50.188
- He's cute.
- Raul?

15:50.355 --> 15:52.857
- You're not his type.
- Really?

15:53.023 --> 15:59.011
You ever dress up like a lumberjack?
Longshoreman? Greco-Roman wrestler?

15:59.278 --> 16:02.822
- He's gay.
- Really?

16:02.989 --> 16:05.824
- Who's paging me?
- Not a clue.

16:05.991 --> 16:10.411
- Isn't that your job?
- No. Check the board and the charts.

16:10.578 --> 16:13.955
You should've seen this place.
Twenty kids and no refrigerator.

16:14.122 --> 16:16.207
No heat. Roaches everywhere.

16:16.374 --> 16:18.626
Only food was a can of SpaghettiOs.

16:18.793 --> 16:22.629
You gotta wonder about the mothers.
And what about the families?

16:22.796 --> 16:26.006
The neighbors... Can't these people
take care of their own kids?

16:26.173 --> 16:29.008
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What does what mean?

16:29.175 --> 16:30.385
"These people. "

16:30.551 --> 16:32.260
- Come on.
- Partner, catch.

16:32.803 --> 16:36.389
Why can't these black folks
take care of their kids, right?

16:36.555 --> 16:38.599
- He didn't say that.
- That's what he meant.

16:38.766 --> 16:41.309
- Then I would have said it.
- What's going on?

16:41.476 --> 16:45.312
- David Duke's enlightening us.
- Oh, Malik, that's not fair.

16:45.479 --> 16:47.563
Think those kids deserve
to live like that?

16:47.730 --> 16:51.525
- What about personal responsibility?
- You think it's equal?

16:52.275 --> 16:56.028
- He's the surgeon. I'm the fireman.
- You would find it that simple.

16:56.195 --> 17:00.407
- The system works the same for all.
- It works pretty well for you.

17:00.573 --> 17:03.075
You don't know a damn thing
about what works for me.

17:03.242 --> 17:06.577
Peter, I've been paging you. Trauma 2.

17:10.454 --> 17:14.583
- What was that all about?
- You, man, that's what.

17:18.586 --> 17:21.464
- Loretta?
- It's her kid. Sore throat, temp's 101.

17:21.630 --> 17:24.800
- Where's Ross?
- Tied up with those kids.

17:24.967 --> 17:27.218
- How you been?
- Good.

17:27.385 --> 17:30.887
This is Annie, and this is my Jimmy.
His throat's sore.

17:31.054 --> 17:34.223
Well, let me take a look there, Jimmy.

17:36.600 --> 17:40.145
Jimmy, open up your mouth.
Stick out your tongue. That's good.

17:42.813 --> 17:47.150
Does that hurt when you swallow?
That hurts too, huh?

17:47.316 --> 17:49.651
- Glands are swollen.
- Still has his tonsils.

17:49.818 --> 17:54.655
You've got a little strep throat, Jimmy,
but we can clear that right up.

17:54.822 --> 17:57.699
- Is your throat sore, Annie?
- I'm okay.

17:57.866 --> 18:01.869
- Okay. And, Mom, how are you doing?
- I'm doing really good.

18:02.035 --> 18:04.829
I've still got the office job,
and we moved into a house.

18:04.996 --> 18:08.165
- The PID hasn't flared up?
- I get a little bleeding sometimes.

18:08.331 --> 18:12.835
Yeah? Lydia, why don't you take
the kids and I can talk to Mom.

18:13.002 --> 18:16.296
- It's no big deal.
- Come on, we've got some videos.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.006
- You've seen The Lion King?
- No.

18:18.172 --> 18:21.925
- Yes, you have.
- Go on. I'll be out in a minute.

18:24.719 --> 18:27.012
So how long have you been bleeding?

18:31.932 --> 18:33.684
What do we have?

18:33.851 --> 18:36.978
Seven-year-old male. Small, reducible,
right-sided inguinal mass.

18:37.145 --> 18:39.264
It's all right. This is Peter.
He's a doctor.

18:39.265 --> 18:41.784
He's gonna help you feel better, okay?

18:45.192 --> 18:47.444
- You paged me this morning.
- Where were you?

18:47.611 --> 18:52.656
- On rounds, which you pulled me off.
- I thought you were assigned to the ER.

18:52.823 --> 18:56.034
No, I'm assigned to the surgical service.
I cover the ER.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.036
And when I'm paged,
someone should be waiting for me.

18:59.202 --> 19:00.913
We've been a little busy today.

19:01.580 --> 19:03.915
Almost over, Michael. Almost.

19:04.081 --> 19:06.833
- He doesn't have a hernia.
- Check him again.

19:07.459 --> 19:08.835
You're wasting my time.

19:09.627 --> 19:10.919
- Peter.
- It's not there!

19:11.086 --> 19:12.588
Check him again.

19:18.342 --> 19:20.886
Still reducible.
I'll put him on a surgical schedule.

19:21.052 --> 19:23.137
I'll operate tomorrow.
Draw pre-op labs.

19:29.558 --> 19:32.394
Peter, what is the matter with you?

19:32.560 --> 19:35.647
If you're angry with me,
take it out on me, not on some boy.

19:35.855 --> 19:38.023
Give us a minute.

19:39.358 --> 19:41.567
That little boy is scared to death.

19:41.734 --> 19:44.152
You're poking around
like you're stuffing a turkey.

19:44.819 --> 19:47.822
Telling him he needs surgery.
He's never seen a doctor.

19:48.739 --> 19:50.783
- Is that it?
- No, that's not it.

19:50.949 --> 19:56.244
If it's about you and me, get over it.
If it's something else, get over that.

19:56.411 --> 19:58.955
I'm sick of it.
Don't you turn your back on me.

19:59.122 --> 20:04.667
That boy needs compassion. If you can't
find that in yourself, get out of medicine.

20:18.886 --> 20:23.390
Sixty-nine-year-old male. History of Ml.
Experienced sudden onset of chest pain.

20:23.556 --> 20:27.434
Took a Nitrotab, called his son.
Paramedics found him unconscious.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.478
One, two, three.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.980
They tubed him.
He's hypotensive, 40 palp.

20:33.147 --> 20:37.275
O-2, 100 percent.
Let's get a 12-lead.

20:37.442 --> 20:43.071
Pulse ox, chest x-ray, CBC, Chem-7,
cardiac enzymes and grab a blood gas.

20:43.238 --> 20:44.656
- You the son?
- Yes.

20:44.823 --> 20:47.449
- He's had a heart attack before?
- Two years ago.

20:47.616 --> 20:51.828
He's hypoxic. Rales bilaterally.

20:51.994 --> 20:55.122
- Jugular venous distention.
- Haleh, let's get an echo.

20:55.288 --> 20:59.875
- Dopamine?
-200 mics per minute. Call Cardiology.

21:00.042 --> 21:02.794
- Hi, I'm Dr. Greene, and you're Mr...?
- Howard Mills.

21:02.961 --> 21:07.214
Your father's in heart failure. It's too
early to know exactly what's happened.

21:07.381 --> 21:09.924
We're running tests,
and you'll know as soon as we do.

21:10.091 --> 21:12.926
- Can I stay?
- Get some coffee and let us do our work.

21:13.093 --> 21:16.179
When your father's stabilized,
I'll come get you, okay?

21:16.346 --> 21:17.805
Okay.

21:20.890 --> 21:24.643
- Bobbi, sorry I'm late.
- No problem.

21:24.810 --> 21:27.187
How about a cup of coffee?
It's only a week old.

21:27.354 --> 21:30.481
No, I'm already on my 1 Oth cup.
I was on all night.

21:30.648 --> 21:33.233
- How's it been going?
- Okay.

21:34.651 --> 21:38.404
I'm a little concerned
about your first student evaluation.

21:41.948 --> 21:47.660
"Pleasant, helpful, lacks assertiveness,
needs to take control to be useful.

21:47.827 --> 21:52.289
Good skills, but may not be suited
to work in the Emergency Department. "

21:55.708 --> 21:57.042
Is that from Peter Benton?

21:57.209 --> 21:59.711
- Who?
- Dr. Peter Benton, surgical Resident.

21:59.878 --> 22:03.422
No. Residents don't evaluate
physician-assistant students.

22:03.589 --> 22:08.050
This is from Carol Hathaway, RN, M.S.

22:08.217 --> 22:10.844
I didn't realize the nurses evaluated us.

22:11.469 --> 22:16.863
Look, I realize that putting P.A.s
into settings where nurses...

22:16.951 --> 22:19.893
...had a monopoly
can cause problems.

22:20.059 --> 22:24.479
But liked or disliked,
we have to do a better job.

22:24.646 --> 22:28.399
So I need to know, can you cut it?

22:28.566 --> 22:32.527
If you can't, I can't afford
to have you fail down there.

22:33.361 --> 22:34.987
I can cut it.

22:35.154 --> 22:38.573
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

22:38.740 --> 22:42.492
- Jennifer filed for divorce?
- Word travels fast.

22:42.659 --> 22:46.078
I knew you were breaking up,
but I thought you'd hold it together.

22:46.245 --> 22:48.914
- With Rachel in the pic-
- Trying to make me feel worse?

22:49.080 --> 22:52.500
No, but if you can't make
a marriage work, how am I gonna?

22:52.667 --> 22:54.835
- Why are you still here?
- Home away from home.

22:55.002 --> 22:58.171
- Cardiology's here on your Ml.
- I want you out of here by 5.

22:58.338 --> 23:01.965
- Can someone help me, please?
- Randi?

23:02.132 --> 23:04.967
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for my grandchildren.

23:05.134 --> 23:09.220
They were living down on Calumet.
Police said they brought them here.

23:09.387 --> 23:13.098
The name's Proulx. The littlest one,
Trey, has got cerebral palsy.

23:16.017 --> 23:21.146
- What are her I's and O's?
-150cc's in, 800cc's out.

23:21.313 --> 23:23.648
- Pressure?
- Down. 80/40.

23:23.814 --> 23:28.026
- Down? Why didn't you call me?
- You didn't put it in your orders.

23:28.193 --> 23:32.112
Give her 300cc's of bolus
and monitor her pressure, please.

23:32.279 --> 23:37.450
- How's our girl doing, doc?
- Not much improvement yet.

23:37.617 --> 23:40.744
Ruby, please. Call me Ruby.

23:40.911 --> 23:44.872
- Coffee? Come on, I bought an extra.
- Oh, no, thanks.

23:45.039 --> 23:50.709
Come on, a cup of hot Joe? You look like
you could stand a little pick-me-up.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.799
Now, that's good coffee.

24:06.429 --> 24:08.264
Should've seen her 50 years ago.

24:09.432 --> 24:12.643
Backstage at the Majestic.

24:12.810 --> 24:16.729
Great gams. Hell of a looker.

24:16.896 --> 24:21.565
Pal Joey,
Way to the Forum, How to Succeed.

24:21.732 --> 24:25.401
Broadway, off-Broadway, you name it.

24:26.778 --> 24:29.072
I did a couple of musicals.

24:29.238 --> 24:33.074
Back in school. Pippin. Fantastiks too.

24:33.241 --> 24:35.243
Yeah, good shows.

24:35.409 --> 24:37.911
- Bet you were wonderful.
- Not really.

24:38.078 --> 24:41.122
- Bet you were great.
- Mr. Carter.

24:41.288 --> 24:44.500
Mostly, I embarrassed myself.

24:46.918 --> 24:49.044
Doctor?

24:51.338 --> 24:54.632
I'm not ready to let her go yet.

25:00.386 --> 25:02.096
Carol?

25:03.222 --> 25:05.348
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure, what's up?

25:05.515 --> 25:09.059
I just had my student evaluation
with my program coordinator.

25:09.226 --> 25:11.936
You've been unhappy with my work.

25:12.103 --> 25:16.648
I think you're competent, but timid.
You need to be more aggressive.

25:16.815 --> 25:19.525
- I've been trying.
- The ER isn't for everybody.

25:19.692 --> 25:23.112
Don't feel bad if you're not
comfortable down here.

25:23.278 --> 25:26.239
Have I done something to offend you
in some way?

25:26.406 --> 25:29.116
This isn't personal. It's just...

25:29.283 --> 25:31.534
You wait for people
to tell you what to do.

25:31.701 --> 25:34.828
Like this conversation.
I tell you to be more aggressive...

25:34.995 --> 25:38.873
...and you want to discuss it.
I can't hold people's hands. Just do it.

25:39.039 --> 25:41.792
- So it's not a P.A. thing?
- No, it's not.

25:41.959 --> 25:45.628
But I've got nurses
who've been here for 20 years.

25:45.795 --> 25:48.922
P.A.s go to school for a couple
of months and tell us what to do?

25:49.089 --> 25:52.466
Two years of training.
Two years of internship.

25:52.633 --> 25:57.137
I went nights while working full-time,
so my training took four years.

25:58.137 --> 26:01.181
If you wanna stay in the ER,
stop looking for validation...

26:01.348 --> 26:03.099
...and start doing the job.

26:03.933 --> 26:06.518
You do that, and we'll get along fine.

26:09.062 --> 26:13.107
Make sure that everyone's ready for
the dog-and-pony show for the trustees.

26:13.273 --> 26:16.151
I don't want a repeat
of last fall's disaster.

26:16.318 --> 26:19.320
- You were looking for me?
- Yes, I was.

26:19.486 --> 26:21.362
- Have you met my assistant?
- No.

26:21.529 --> 26:23.489
- Hi.
- Hello.

26:23.656 --> 26:27.075
- Is Mrs. Rubadoux's paralysis subsiding?
- No.

26:27.242 --> 26:30.244
Don't be disappointed.
It was an emergency situation.

26:30.411 --> 26:34.581
What was our other choice? Death?
Besides, the woman was a bad risk.

26:34.748 --> 26:36.498
Pulmonary disease. Hypertension.

26:36.665 --> 26:39.918
I'm concerned it's my fault.
I performed the procedure.

26:40.127 --> 26:42.170
Oh, please. Don't be so melodramatic.

26:42.337 --> 26:45.756
Your technique was perfect.
We have to exclude her from the study.

26:45.922 --> 26:48.674
She was never an appropriate candidate.

26:50.426 --> 26:53.303
It's time we made Dr. Benton
an official member of the team.

26:53.470 --> 26:55.388
Don't you think, Claire?

26:55.555 --> 26:58.265
Research associate. Yes.

26:58.432 --> 27:01.476
Claire will make sure
you have everything you need.

27:01.642 --> 27:04.311
- I don't know what to say.
- "Thank you" will suffice.

27:05.187 --> 27:06.688
Yeah. Yeah.

27:10.483 --> 27:12.984
- Mr. Mills?
- Howard. Please.

27:13.151 --> 27:15.486
Howard.

27:15.652 --> 27:19.197
We suspect that your father
had a right-ventricle infarction.

27:19.364 --> 27:21.366
- Another heart attack?
- Yes.

27:21.532 --> 27:24.701
We're sending him
to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.

27:24.868 --> 27:27.995
They'll place a Swan-Ganz catheter...

27:27.996 --> 27:31.122
to monitor pressure
in his heart and lungs.

27:31.289 --> 27:35.542
They'll do an echo
to confirm the diagnosis.

27:37.252 --> 27:39.545
Doesn't look good.

27:44.049 --> 27:47.676
I think he wants to go.

27:48.886 --> 27:52.222
My mother died last year.
Breast cancer.

27:54.056 --> 27:55.891
They were married 50 years.

28:04.397 --> 28:06.899
This is you.

28:08.192 --> 28:11.194
Coffee's in the lounge,
bathroom's past the elevators.

28:11.361 --> 28:16.198
Research staff meets
every Tuesday, 8: 15 sharp.

28:16.365 --> 28:19.492
Fill this out and give it back to me
as soon as possible.

28:19.659 --> 28:22.744
- You have a parking space?
- I park in the Resident's lot.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.245
Not anymore, you don't.

28:24.411 --> 28:29.541
- AW4?
- All research associates receive stipends.

28:29.707 --> 28:33.001
And your first referral payment.

28:33.919 --> 28:36.629
I'm Carl's secretary, not yours.

28:36.796 --> 28:39.881
You want your phone answered,
get a machine.

28:40.048 --> 28:43.801
Anything else,
I'm at the end of the hall.

28:53.767 --> 28:57.103
- Trey, how are you doing?
- He's doing better now.

28:57.270 --> 28:59.479
Yeah, he is, isn't he?

28:59.646 --> 29:01.523
Mrs. Proulx, may I speak with you?

29:01.690 --> 29:03.858
- I'll take the little girl.
- Oh, that's okay.

29:04.024 --> 29:07.861
Ty, can you look after
your sister for Nana?

29:11.572 --> 29:15.783
Trey's well enough to be released
to the DCFS. This is Mr. Tuteur.

29:15.950 --> 29:18.535
We'll be taking him over
to Columbus/Maryville.

29:18.702 --> 29:22.621
- It's an emergency shelter. You know it?
- Yes, I've been there before.

29:22.788 --> 29:26.291
- So you won't let me keep them?
- Department's been granted custody.

29:26.457 --> 29:30.210
- There'll be a court hearing next week.
- They were with me till a month ago.

29:30.377 --> 29:33.963
Then their mother came and got them.
I told her they should be with me.

29:34.130 --> 29:39.009
They all have their own rooms and their
own beds at my place. They like it.

29:39.175 --> 29:43.637
Why did you keep them there? You have
custody, they're your responsibility.

29:43.804 --> 29:47.765
She said she was doing better, and
children should be with their mother.

29:47.932 --> 29:53.436
She wasn't always like this.
She loved those babies a lot.

29:53.603 --> 29:55.313
But, you know, it's the drugs.

29:57.647 --> 30:00.649
Are these jackets for them?

30:09.990 --> 30:13.993
Okay, children. Let's put
these coats on, now.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.787
Ty, you help your brother on
with his coat.

30:17.954 --> 30:19.289
Come on.

30:19.456 --> 30:23.083
- Be a good girl, you hear? Okay?
- Okay.

30:23.250 --> 30:26.586
How are we doing? All ready?
Come here, sweetheart.

30:26.753 --> 30:29.921
- You take care of little Trey, Ty.
- Yes, ma'am.

30:30.088 --> 30:32.798
- I'm scared.
- Come on, sweetheart. Come with me.

30:32.965 --> 30:37.302
There we go. I got you, sweetie.
Okay, we ready?

30:37.469 --> 30:40.554
- Let's go.
- When can I go home?

30:43.681 --> 30:48.352
Ty. Now, you take good care
of little Trey, you hear?

30:48.518 --> 30:51.145
Yes, ma'am.

31:29.965 --> 31:32.093
51-year-old woman.
Abdominal pain and cramps.

31:32.259 --> 31:34.761
Thinks she ate too much.
Gotta weigh 300 pounds.

31:34.928 --> 31:36.970
Is this day ever gonna end?

31:37.137 --> 31:42.350
Mrs. Saunders? Did you have
a little too much holiday cheer?

31:42.517 --> 31:44.893
She's been in pain for days.
I had to drag her in.

31:45.227 --> 31:49.772
- When did the cramps start?
- New Year's Day, after dinner.

31:49.939 --> 31:53.983
- Any pain here? Vomiting?
- I've been nauseous.

31:54.150 --> 31:55.568
- Diarrhea?
- No.

31:55.735 --> 31:59.071
- What did you have to eat?
- Usual holiday stuff.

31:59.238 --> 32:02.840
Potato salad, ham, cheesecake,

32:02.885 --> 32:05.615
pumpkin pie. Some sushi.

32:06.493 --> 32:11.330
Get a stool culture,
rule out salmonella, and a rectal.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.248
Chuny will help you.

32:13.414 --> 32:16.124
I doubt if it's appendicitis.

32:16.291 --> 32:19.877
It's probably viral gastroenteritis
or a touch of food poisoning.

32:20.044 --> 32:24.548
Get a surgical consult. CBC,
Chem-7, UA, abdominal series.

32:24.714 --> 32:27.758
Set up for a pelvic and find Benton.

32:28.342 --> 32:31.344
7-3-5-2-9-0-1.

32:31.511 --> 32:34.013
Date of admission: 12-26-95.
Dictating...

32:35.472 --> 32:39.559
- Can I interrupt you for a minute?
- You already have.

32:41.561 --> 32:47.147
Mrs. Rubadoux isn't improving.
I've tried Lasix, nitrates, pressors.

32:47.314 --> 32:48.983
She seesaws back and forth.

32:49.149 --> 32:51.276
She's volume-depleted,
pressure's dropping...

32:51.442 --> 32:53.778
...or pressure's up
and her pulse ox is dropping.

32:53.944 --> 32:55.946
- Put her on dobutamine?
- You said not to.

32:56.238 --> 33:00.741
Do you always follow instructions even
when you've surmised they're incorrect?

33:02.117 --> 33:05.703
She's a sinking ship,
and you're rearranging her deck chairs.

33:06.912 --> 33:08.247
You're probably right.

33:08.414 --> 33:12.834
Once we've bundled her off, she'll
decompensate and end up right here.

33:13.001 --> 33:17.712
But she won't be on our service,
and she won't be your problem.

33:20.548 --> 33:21.881
Let's see...

33:22.632 --> 33:25.342
Discharge summary on David
Piscuscus. Date of admission-

33:25.509 --> 33:27.594
Did I make her worse today?

33:29.637 --> 33:31.973
She's dying, Mr. Carter.

33:32.348 --> 33:34.975
Nothing you did is going to change that.

33:36.600 --> 33:41.813
Date of admission: 12-26-95.
Date of discharge: 01-08-96.

33:41.980 --> 33:45.232
Patient presented with claudication of
the right lower extremity...

33:45.399 --> 33:50.445
Marcus Miller? Bill Evans?
Wynton Marsalis? You gotta know him.

33:50.611 --> 33:51.945
The Jay Leno show?

33:52.988 --> 33:54.323
Hold up a second, will you?

33:56.741 --> 34:00.869
- Excuse me. It's Malik, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

34:01.036 --> 34:06.040
About earlier, I hope you didn't
misunderstand what I was trying to say.

34:06.206 --> 34:07.832
No, I didn't misunderstand.

34:07.999 --> 34:09.542
I've got 10 minutes.

34:09.708 --> 34:15.337
I think we're all doing okay,
and nobody owes anybody anything.

34:15.545 --> 34:18.257
Let's get on with our lives
and do what we can.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.467
- Sure, whatever, man.
- Shep, let's go.

34:20.632 --> 34:22.260
Yeah, hold up.

34:23.594 --> 34:27.054
- I was trying to be nice.
- What do you want me to say?

34:27.221 --> 34:31.683
That I don't think you're a bigot? Fine.
I don't think you're a bigot.

34:31.850 --> 34:33.351
Shep. God, please.

34:46.777 --> 34:51.114
- I'm not a racist. You think I'm a racist?
- Just drink your coffee.

34:51.281 --> 34:55.784
I ride with Raul 60 hours a week.
My sister dated a black guy two years.

34:55.951 --> 34:59.245
Raul and I go to the Y
twice a week to play ball.

34:59.412 --> 35:01.663
I'm the only white guy there.
The only one!

35:04.583 --> 35:05.917
I'm not a racist!

35:10.670 --> 35:12.005
I'm not.

35:13.339 --> 35:15.841
- What do we have?
-51-year-old with abdominal pain.

35:16.008 --> 35:18.927
Mark figures gastroenteritis,
wants to rule out appendicitis.

35:19.093 --> 35:21.428
The pain's getting worse.

35:21.595 --> 35:24.972
- Does it hurt here? How about here?
- No.

35:25.139 --> 35:26.933
- Okay.
- Oh, God!

35:27.099 --> 35:29.392
- What's happening?
- When did it get this severe?

35:29.559 --> 35:32.311
- I don't know. I just came back.
- There. Better.

35:32.478 --> 35:34.271
- Charts back?
- Chuny went to get them.

35:34.438 --> 35:36.898
It keeps coming in waves.

35:37.065 --> 35:39.192
- How often?
- About every minute.

35:39.359 --> 35:41.693
- Anybody do a pelvic exam?
- Not yet.

35:41.860 --> 35:45.029
- When was your last period?
- Year and a half. Oh, God!

35:45.196 --> 35:46.739
- Okay.
- Here it comes again!

35:46.906 --> 35:48.240
Okay, just put your legs up.

35:48.406 --> 35:51.659
- Her leg. Grab her leg.
- Forty-five seconds apart.

35:53.953 --> 35:55.745
She's fully dilated. She's crowning.

35:55.912 --> 35:59.831
Get OB-GYN and find Greene.
Don't push, okay.

35:59.998 --> 36:02.501
- What's going on?
- Get Mark. B.O.A.

36:02.833 --> 36:03.918
Dr. Greene!

36:04.627 --> 36:07.921
- What's happening?
- You're not overeating. You're in labor.

36:09.005 --> 36:11.507
- She's having a baby?
- Where's everybody? Let's move!

36:11.674 --> 36:15.843
- She's gone through menopause!
- Carla, call Daddy.

36:16.010 --> 36:21.557
- Oh, God! Here it comes again!
- Don't push! Don't push!

36:24.350 --> 36:29.145
- I haven't delivered since med school.
- Just guide the head.

36:29.312 --> 36:31.564
Okay. First time for everything, huh?

36:31.730 --> 36:36.734
All right, Mrs. Saunders. Good girl.
Breathe. Blow through your mouth.

36:38.944 --> 36:42.071
Okay, good. Good.

36:45.824 --> 36:51.328
She's doing better. Guess I'll have
to start watching myself...

36:51.495 --> 36:53.705
...around those nurses.

36:53.871 --> 36:56.332
We put her on dobutamine.

36:57.332 --> 37:01.252
- Hi, how are you feeling?
- Very tired.

37:01.419 --> 37:06.256
Dr. Carter is gonna have you
back again dancing in no time.

37:06.923 --> 37:10.634
Well, for now why don't you try
to get some more rest.

37:11.218 --> 37:13.386
You too, Ruby.
Go home and get some sleep.

37:14.971 --> 37:18.223
I promised Helen I'd stay
until she could come home with me.

37:24.728 --> 37:28.439
Ruby, I think you should consider
the possibility...

37:28.605 --> 37:32.025
...that your wife
may need long-term care.

37:36.653 --> 37:38.947
You don't know my Helen.

37:39.447 --> 37:41.741
She's a real trouper.

37:43.033 --> 37:45.452
A real trouper.

37:46.036 --> 37:48.370
Right, sweetheart?

37:51.873 --> 37:54.750
This is my beeper number.

37:54.916 --> 38:00.565
If you need anything tonight
or whenever, just give me a call.

38:06.216 --> 38:09.762
You're the only person around here
who gives a damn.

38:11.137 --> 38:14.514
Thank you. For both of us.

38:22.312 --> 38:25.606
- Mark, you missed all the fun.
- That fat lady had twins.

38:25.773 --> 38:28.025
- My abdominal pain?
- Curtain Area 3.

38:28.192 --> 38:29.734
Should've seen Benton's face.

38:29.901 --> 38:32.236
- Benton?
- That's why I was paging you.

38:32.403 --> 38:36.281
We moved them to Postpartum.
Mom's fine, babies too. Boy and girl.

38:36.448 --> 38:40.825
- Loretta Sweet. Biopsy came back.
- Really?

38:40.992 --> 38:43.161
- Damn.
- Stage 1 B carcinoma.

38:43.328 --> 38:45.287
Missed those annual Pap smears.

38:45.454 --> 38:48.123
- Is she still around?
- Left with her kids hours ago.

38:48.290 --> 38:52.834
- Call her, get her back.
- Already tried. Number's disconnected.

38:53.001 --> 38:58.380
- Want me to send out a social worker?
- No.

38:58.547 --> 39:02.467
- You know her address?
-1604 North Sedgewick.

39:02.634 --> 39:04.802
Out by Cabrini-Green.

39:04.968 --> 39:08.888
- Cervical cancer. That's tough.
- Couple of kids.

39:09.055 --> 39:12.474
- You want a ride out there?
- No, I drove in today. Thanks.

39:12.641 --> 39:17.102
Okay, '96 is gonna be
a hell of a year, huh?

39:34.032 --> 39:35.366
Thanks.

39:39.452 --> 39:44.456
- I got you some pecan pie. Looks good.
- I don't like pecan pie.

39:44.623 --> 39:46.958
- Since when?
- Since never.

39:49.168 --> 39:51.753
- Thanks for meeting me.
- You said it was important.

39:54.755 --> 39:57.591
- How's work going?
- Fine.

39:57.758 --> 40:00.593
- And your folks, they're fine?
- They're fine too.

40:00.760 --> 40:05.846
Al, I've been on my feet
since 4:00 yesterday afternoon.

40:06.013 --> 40:09.474
So if it's the same with you,
can we just...?

40:09.641 --> 40:12.269
Let's just do this some other time.

40:14.103 --> 40:16.230
Maybe we should we give it another try.

40:17.689 --> 40:21.525
Maybe we should give us another try.

40:23.485 --> 40:25.444
I'll have kids if you really want them.

40:25.611 --> 40:28.489
I've been thinking about it,
and kids would be okay.

40:28.655 --> 40:30.532
Great.

40:30.699 --> 40:33.534
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- Yeah, it was. I gotta go.

40:37.161 --> 40:38.955
I'm sorry.

40:39.122 --> 40:41.123
I'm ready now.

40:41.290 --> 40:43.834
Kids. Being home.

40:46.294 --> 40:49.462
No more playing around. No more lies.

40:50.630 --> 40:52.172
I gotta go.

41:00.960 --> 41:03.307
SEDGEWICK AVENUE

41:49.174 --> 41:50.966
Michael, right?

41:51.717 --> 41:55.011
Hey, I'm Dr. Benton.
We met earlier this morning, remember?

41:58.722 --> 42:02.349
Michael, you're gonna have an operation
tomorrow for a hernia.

42:02.516 --> 42:04.934
- You know what a hernia is?
- No.

42:06.519 --> 42:09.855
It's when you've got a balloon
poking out in your groin.

42:10.022 --> 42:13.941
- A balloon?
- Not a real balloon.

42:14.901 --> 42:18.236
The part of your insides
that looks like a balloon.

42:18.987 --> 42:21.655
If we don't fix it, you can get sick.

42:21.822 --> 42:24.866
- Will it hurt?
- You'll be asleep.

42:25.700 --> 42:27.035
But I'm scared.

42:30.037 --> 42:33.915
That's all right.
It's okay to be scared.

42:34.081 --> 42:36.374
You'll be fine.
I'm doing the operation.

42:36.541 --> 42:38.293
You will?

42:38.460 --> 42:41.128
It's no big deal.
A lot of kids have had it done.

42:44.839 --> 42:47.716
Will you stay with me for a while?

42:54.722 --> 42:57.724
Yeah. Sure.

43:26.245 --> 43:30.164
- Did I wake you up?
- Oh, I was on last night.

43:30.331 --> 43:32.708
- I'm sorry. I should've called.
- No, that's okay.

43:32.875 --> 43:35.502
Susie went down early,
so I sacked out on the couch.

43:35.669 --> 43:37.503
I brought pizza and beer.

43:38.879 --> 43:41.381
I should've called.
See you at work tomorrow.

43:41.547 --> 43:46.009
- What kind of pizza?
- Meat. Lots of meat.

43:46.635 --> 43:49.637
- Pepperoni?
- Probably some in there.

43:51.138 --> 43:53.848
- You have any diapers left to change?
- Always.

44:32.836 --> 44:36.463
- Hello?
- This is Carter. Somebody beeped me.

44:36.630 --> 44:40.591
Carter, this is Ruby. Mr. Rubadoux?

44:40.758 --> 44:43.135
Hi, Ruby. How's she doing?

44:43.301 --> 44:46.929
It's so late. I was worrying about
calling you. Is it okay?

44:47.096 --> 44:50.516
- No. I told you you could call.
- She's in trouble.

44:50.682 --> 44:53.601
- She's what?
- She's having trouble breathing.

44:53.768 --> 44:56.812
That's normal.

44:58.147 --> 45:00.648
Yeah, that's gonna happen.

45:04.943 --> 45:07.111
Yeah, I'll talk to the nurse.

45:07.945 --> 45:11.072
Hi, this is Carter. What's her pressure?
