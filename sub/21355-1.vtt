<i>I've just been advised</i>
<i>by our group that we are deploying</i>

00:27.110 --> 00:29.773
<i>six members of law enforcement</i>
<i>and two canine dogs to aid...</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:31.980
<i>Another day of searching
in the desert for clues</i>

00:32.073 --> 00:33.690
<i>in the case of three missing teens.</i>

00:33.784 --> 00:35.696
<i>Multiple law enforcement agencies are here.</i>

00:35.786 --> 00:39.111
<i>Well, there's still volunteers continuing
the search, the satellite images...</i>

00:39.206 --> 00:40.913
<i>So anyone with any information at all...</i>

00:40.999 --> 00:42.740
<i>...doubled since yesterday.</i>

00:42.834 --> 00:45.918
<i>As more time goes on,</i>
<i>they're really pushing their resources</i>

00:46.004 --> 00:47.836
<i>to make sure these teenagers are found.</i>

01:00.102 --> 01:02.389
You know, I read an article,

01:02.479 --> 01:06.392
you wouldn't believe the living
you can make photographing food.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.814
Hey, Dad, what's the secret
to making a great burger?

01:10.904 --> 01:13.612
Well, the first thing you got to do
is you got to get your coals hot.

01:14.825 --> 01:18.159
Super hot, so when you put it on there,
it seals in the juices.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.828
Then you don't flip it but one time.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.081
That's the secret.

01:24.167 --> 01:29.333
<i># Happy birthday, dear Sophie #</i>

01:29.423 --> 01:34.635
<i># Happy birthday to you #</i>

01:34.720 --> 01:36.712
- Make a wish, sweetie. Make a good one.
- And many more.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.801
Okay, keep going.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.224
- Keep going, one more! You did it!
- Go, go, go!

01:46.023 --> 01:48.015
Come on. Sit down.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.942
Imagine that you were going
to talk to grown-up Sophie.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.860
What would you say to yourself?

01:52.946 --> 01:54.778
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

01:56.908 --> 01:59.366
Can you give Sophie
some advice for the future?

01:59.453 --> 02:03.163
Sophie, when you get older,
you must obey your husband.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.614
- You must obey him.
- Gramps!

02:04.708 --> 02:05.994
- What, to Soph?
- Yeah.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.200
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

02:07.294 --> 02:08.535
You want to do it right now?

02:08.628 --> 02:11.042
Happy birthday, honey. I love you.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.257
I love you, Sophie. You're the best.

02:15.344 --> 02:18.087
Your brother is crazy, but I love him too.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.718
And now he's going to talk to you,
so give me... give me the camera.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.174
- No, no, no, I'm the director.
- No, honey, I want the camera now.

02:23.268 --> 02:27.228
No, it's your turn.
Sit down next to your sister. Come on.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.600
- Now you know how I feel.
- Okay.

02:28.690 --> 02:32.149
All right. I want you to, uh, say
something very sweet to your sister.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.103
A nice wish for her sixth year of life. Go.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.404
<i>This is how</i>
<i>I remember my brother. How I try to.</i>

02:41.328 --> 02:43.411
<i>Sitting next to me</i>
<i>at my sixth birthday party.</i>

02:44.581 --> 02:46.914
<i>Before anyone knew</i>
<i>our lives were about to change.</i>

02:47.876 --> 02:50.289
<i>That this would be</i>
<i>the last time we were all together.</i>

03:22.494 --> 03:25.237
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. Hey.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.322
- It's so good to see you.
- Good to see you.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.617
- How was your flight?
- Uh, good. This is Jay.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.159
Jay, this is my dad, Steve.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.711
How are you, Steve? Nice to meet you.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.501
What did you pack, Jay?

03:39.386 --> 03:41.469
Are you going to be filming the whole time?

03:42.097 --> 03:43.838
Yeah, that's, uh... that's the idea.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.553
You're like Harrison Ford.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.427
Okay, I'm over here in the scam lot.

03:49.521 --> 03:52.059
That's what they do, they scam you.
They've got the public one

03:52.149 --> 03:54.812
that's so far over,
it might as well be in another county.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.686
You go there,
you're going to miss your flight.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.103
And, uh...

04:01.074 --> 04:03.031
they resell the flight and then...

04:04.119 --> 04:06.202
you're shit out of luck is what you are.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.961
So you've got your own little reality show?

04:16.047 --> 04:17.333
It's not a reality show, dad.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.791
- It's a documentary.
- Documentary, huh?

04:19.885 --> 04:21.216
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.753
What's your documentary about?

04:26.808 --> 04:28.515
It's about Josh.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.428
Josh?

04:40.447 --> 04:42.564
<i>Anyone with any information at all,</i>

04:42.657 --> 04:44.740

04:59.925 --> 05:02.258
<i>There are still volunteers
continuing the search,</i>

05:02.344 --> 05:04.802
<i>uh, and satellite imaging is ongoing.</i>

05:04.888 --> 05:07.175

05:18.985 --> 05:21.147
Well... sold.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.570
Yeah.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.826
You don't want to come in?

05:35.126 --> 05:37.038
I... No, I-I better not.

05:37.128 --> 05:40.212
- Just, uh, say hi to mom for me.
- Okay.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.664
- Okay?
- Yeah.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.545
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay. Bye.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.186
Well, I like your bangs.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.184
- You're so cute!
- Mom!

05:58.358 --> 06:00.190
While you're here,
you've got to go through everything,

06:00.277 --> 06:01.813
- or else I'm giving it to the yard sale.
- Okay.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.190
- Okay?
- I'm fine, okay. I don't need my blankie.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.408
Well, as you can see, um...

06:17.502 --> 06:19.084
what's the point of redecorating?

06:19.963 --> 06:22.455
While you're here, I was hoping
you could help me pick up this stuff.

06:22.924 --> 06:27.468
I have a ton of boxes in the garage and
between the two of us it shouldn't take us...

06:30.181 --> 06:31.547
Do you still have the tapes?

06:46.448 --> 06:49.566
- This is it, huh?
- Yeah.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.117
That's the one. That's... how it all started.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.579
<i>Oh, it's your turn.</i>

06:59.669 --> 07:00.910
<i>Sit down next to your sister.</i>

07:01.004 --> 07:03.291
<i>Come on. Now you know how I feel.</i>

07:03.381 --> 07:05.589
- <i>Okay. Okay.</i>
- <i>I want you to, uh,</i>

07:05.675 --> 07:07.211
<i>say something very sweet to your sister.</i>

07:07.302 --> 07:09.840
A nice wish for her sixth year of life. Go.

07:12.891 --> 07:17.602
Okay. Well, Sophie,
I have one thing to say to you...

07:17.687 --> 07:20.851
Wow. Look at this.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.853
Whoa! Is that an airplane?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.309
I don't know.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.402
Oh! Josh! Careful!

07:27.489 --> 07:28.354
It's bright.

07:29.824 --> 07:30.905
Hold on.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.574
I don't think it's an airplane.

07:32.661 --> 07:33.822
- Hmm.
- Huh.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.528
Oh, look at that! A fourth one!

07:38.124 --> 07:41.663
They're in formation of some kind,
but they're not really moving.

07:41.753 --> 07:44.120
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

07:44.214 --> 07:46.547
Five, six, seven lights.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.549
Have you guys ever seen
anything like this before?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.719
- Hey!
- You see that.

07:51.805 --> 07:55.344
You see that? What is that?

07:55.433 --> 07:57.971
- Oh, my God.
- What is that?

07:58.061 --> 07:59.802
That's definitely not a plane.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.478
That's one object.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.228
- Wow, I've never seen anything like it.
- Oh, my God!

08:05.318 --> 08:07.184
- Honey, zoom in on it.
- I'm zooming, Mom.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.234
Okay. Okay.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.899
Whoa!

08:09.990 --> 08:12.323
- Whoa!
- They're aliens or something.

08:13.535 --> 08:16.198
- They're gone.
- That's weird.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.823
What was that?

08:19.541 --> 08:20.657
I don't know.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.912
- Where did they go?
- They're gone.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.962
Maybe they... they could have
gone behind the mountain maybe.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.460
- No, there's no clouds!
- Yeah, we saw the same thing.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.667
- That was interesting.
- That was a show, right?

08:30.760 --> 08:32.592
- Yeah, right?
- Guys, you know what that was?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.174
- Those were UFOs!
- Oh, come on.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.256
Those were UFOs! That's what a UFO is!

08:37.350 --> 08:39.307
You guys, I think that's our cue to clean up.

08:39.394 --> 08:42.386
- We gotta... Right? Come on.
- Are you kidding me? Dad!

08:43.481 --> 08:46.019
Yeah, it was probably, um...

08:46.109 --> 08:47.350
I don't know, military.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.151
Yeah, we've got to get the presents, Josh.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.072
Josh, put the camera down

08:53.158 --> 08:55.024
- and just help your mother clean up, okay?
- Soph...

08:55.118 --> 08:56.734
what do you think that was?

08:56.828 --> 08:58.444
I don't know!

09:06.755 --> 09:08.462
Holy moly.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.039
You okay, Soph?

09:11.551 --> 09:12.837
You all right?

09:12.927 --> 09:14.088
Yeah.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.006
That was the Air Force, Dad!

09:19.100 --> 09:21.057
Well, I hope it was our Air Force.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.601
Grandpa.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.683
That was amazing!

09:33.573 --> 09:35.439
<i>When these lights appeared over Phoenix,</i>

09:35.533 --> 09:39.243
<i>people immediately thought:</i>
<i>UFOs. Outer space.</i>

09:39.329 --> 09:41.537
- We were standing about here?
- Right about here.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.285
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

09:43.374 --> 09:45.832
They went just over the valley
toward South Mountain

09:45.919 --> 09:47.956
in like a...
what seemed to be a "V" formation,

09:48.922 --> 09:51.209
- It was definitely interesting.
- Mm-hmm.

09:51.299 --> 09:54.007
<i>So far, the military
hasn't claimed any testing</i>

09:54.094 --> 09:56.381
<i>in the area from nearby Luke Air Force Base,</i>

09:56.471 --> 09:58.212
<i>which leaves many residents wondering</i>

09:58.306 --> 10:00.423
<i>"What were those mysterious lights?"</i>

10:00.517 --> 10:02.975
It seemed like the Air Force didn't know
what it was, and if that's true,

10:03.061 --> 10:05.974
then what was it, you know? I don't know.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.266
And now I'll ask
Officer Stein and his colleagues

10:10.360 --> 10:14.528
to escort the accused into the room so that
we may all look upon the guilty party.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.401
Don't get him too close to me, please.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.525
This just goes to show
that you guys are entirely too serious.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.284
<i>No one really took it that
seriously from what I remember.</i>

10:24.374 --> 10:25.581
<i>Except Josh.</i>

10:25.667 --> 10:26.908
<i>Would you say he was sort of</i>

10:27.001 --> 10:29.664
single-minded about stuff,
like, once he got an idea?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.791
Yeah. Yeah, there was no stopping him.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.441
Peeeeeew. Peeeew.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.396
Excuse me, sir, do you have
a second to talk about the...

10:57.490 --> 11:00.654
- Nope.
- ...Phoenix Lights? Okay, thank you.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.360
- It was just a "V" like this.
- And you saw that yourself?

11:03.454 --> 11:06.447
It was just a "V" like that, man.
And we were like...

11:06.541 --> 11:09.249
and we were like,
"Hey, man, check that out, man."

11:11.004 --> 11:14.213
I know... UFOs will come

11:15.175 --> 11:19.089
at us... and attack one day.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.136
- You think they'll attack?
- And if that happ...

11:21.222 --> 11:25.216
And if that happens, we will be prepared.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.642
So, did you see the lights?

11:32.442 --> 11:35.435
No, not personally.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.861
Okay, so you saw them on, like, the news?

11:37.947 --> 11:40.234
- Yeah.
- Awesome. Channel 3?

11:41.117 --> 11:42.198
No.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.280
It doesn't matter.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.953
Uh, do you think it was a UFO?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.326
I don't know. Maybe.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.208
- Okay, so, um...
- Can I ask you something now?

11:52.295 --> 11:54.287
- Yeah.
- Can I give you some advice?

11:54.380 --> 11:57.088
- Umm, sure. Yeah.
- This is an interview, right?

11:57.175 --> 11:59.212
- Yeah.
- So maybe you should ask me

11:59.302 --> 12:00.838
some open-ended questions.

12:00.929 --> 12:03.592
You know, like, things that don't
just warrant yes or no answers.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.172
Just, like, get me to talk...

12:05.266 --> 12:06.802
Okay, yeah. No. Sure.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.343
Is this the same place?

12:11.773 --> 12:16.359
She just had this charm
about her that was electric.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.151
I think because of that
she could get a lot out of people,

12:21.241 --> 12:23.779
people trusted her, saw her as a confidant.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.862
Jack was kind of pushing the lawyer thing,

12:27.956 --> 12:31.620
but truly I... I think
Ashley's passion was journalism.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.079
<i>Good morning, Canyon Park High School.</i>

12:37.173 --> 12:39.335
<i>I'm Ashley Foster, CPTV.</i>

12:40.802 --> 12:43.215
Just want to say hello to all the new
freshmen in the building.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.511
Welcome aboard.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.722
I know locker combinations can be tricky,

12:47.809 --> 12:49.892
but you'll make it through just like I did.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.719
So just keep trying.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.054
Together, we're a team...

12:54.065 --> 12:56.227
and this is not teamwork.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.650
- That's cute.
- Yeah.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.068
What did you guys think of Josh?

13:00.905 --> 13:01.986
We didn't know him.

13:04.659 --> 13:07.197
- Is that Josh's yearbook?
- Yeah, umm...

13:07.704 --> 13:08.785
Ashley signed it.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.078
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.951
- There it is.
- Oh!

13:12.041 --> 13:13.907
Look at that.

13:15.837 --> 13:18.875
I mean, he was never one of these kids
that came over to the house.

13:20.842 --> 13:23.380
That's it. Josh Bishop.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.924
- Seems like she had a lot of friends.
- Oh, she did, yeah.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.847
She was a charmer.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.017
Have you ever... Have you ever heard
the story of Ezekiel's wheel?

13:33.021 --> 13:34.102
Umm...

13:35.732 --> 13:39.351
- It-It's from the Bible.
- Oh. Yeah. Definitely not.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.983
Ezekiel describes God
coming down from heaven in a chariot.

13:43.072 --> 13:46.190
It's lighting up the sky,
but all along the outside are eyes.

13:48.286 --> 13:49.697
Why would God need a spaceship?

13:49.787 --> 13:53.997
Exactly, because he is space.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.288
Yeah.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.165
- All right, we're done. It's cool.
- It's done?

13:59.255 --> 14:01.542
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Great. Okay. Bye.

14:01.632 --> 14:02.839
Thanks for doing it.

14:08.848 --> 14:12.637
<i>A very sweet girl. I met her a few times.</i>

14:12.727 --> 14:15.470
I definitely know that
Josh had a crush on her and...

14:17.148 --> 14:18.184
I'm hoping...

14:19.692 --> 14:21.900
Now I'm going to cry,
I'm hoping she liked him.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.649
Just because they...

14:25.740 --> 14:29.074
spent so much time together,
it would have been nice to know that he,

14:29.160 --> 14:31.777
in his short life, could experience that.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.579
- That's Ashley's handwriting.
- Mm-hmm.

14:38.669 --> 14:42.876
And how much do you know about
what Ashley and Josh were working on?

14:42.965 --> 14:46.049
We certainly didn't know any of that until...

14:46.135 --> 14:47.251
- later.
- Later.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.632
- It was after.
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.588
- We knew very little.
- Mm-hmm.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.975
We're going to meet with some astronomers.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.651
- Okay.
- They're going to have rocks

15:04.737 --> 15:06.899
and all different kinds of stuff to show us,

15:06.989 --> 15:09.697
so we've got to be prepared, and we need
to make sure that we're on our "A" game.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.113
What does our "A" game mean?

15:12.203 --> 15:14.320
We just have to be professional.

15:14.414 --> 15:18.624
But I'm feeling... I feel like I've been
pretty professional so far, thank you.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.996
I don't think I'm exactly amateur hour.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.249
I know, but I-I guess
I'm just a little nervous.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.500
I want everything to go good.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.547
Well, do you have any questions prepared?

15:26.634 --> 15:29.251
I have a ton, they're in my backpack.
Do you have my backpack by the way?

15:29.345 --> 15:30.756
Yeah, I do.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.307
Have you ever held a meteorite before?

15:40.356 --> 15:41.813
I'll start with this one.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.559
Whoa!

15:45.653 --> 15:49.863
We get phone calls about UFOs
kind of frequently.

15:49.949 --> 15:53.192
So when the Phoenix Lights happened,
were people calling and asking?

15:53.286 --> 15:55.903
Uh... yeah, they were.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.659
- A few.
- He shot the footage.

15:57.748 --> 16:00.616
- Oh, you shot the footage?
- That's right, yeah.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.794
Oh, congratulations! Can you learn to focus?

16:03.880 --> 16:05.496
There you go.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.627
<i>They're in a formation of some kind,</i>

16:07.717 --> 16:09.128
<i>but they're not really moving.</i>

16:09.218 --> 16:11.255
Okay, that's more likely flares.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.803
<i>The flares are probably</i>
<i>fifty to a hundred miles away.</i>

16:16.893 --> 16:20.136
<i>So you don't see the smoke. You just see</i>
<i>a bright light that just hangs there</i>

16:20.229 --> 16:22.596
<i>because of the parachute</i>
<i>to hold them in place.</i>

16:22.690 --> 16:24.727
Would you say you're
a hundred percent sure it's not

16:24.817 --> 16:27.901
or you're ninety-nine percent sure
and still open to the possibility?

16:27.987 --> 16:32.106
No, I'm a hundred percent sure
that-that-that... that that's what it was.

16:35.453 --> 16:38.537
- Oh! A jet.
- It's an F-18.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.410
- What was that?
- What did you say, Don?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.787
- F-18.
- How do you know?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.372
He's got the ear for it.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.334
All right, I got as close as I could.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.338
There's this creepy guy
who was just staring me down.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.420
I think he was about to call security on me.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.130
You actually believe it was the Air Force.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.260
- You believe that...
- I do not.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.808
- You believe the bearded...
- I don't know what I believe yet!

16:59.894 --> 17:02.181
- I'm open...
- The bearded Galileo Society

17:02.271 --> 17:06.106
of Phoenix, Arizona. I'm disappointed.
You're no longer a producer.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.479
I am absolutely a producer!

17:23.376 --> 17:24.708
I think I found the section.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.121
"Ancient UFO sightings."

17:29.215 --> 17:31.832
Check this out. Petroglyphs.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.964
That's totally a spaceship.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.046
Isn't this that Bible thing
you were talking about?

17:37.139 --> 17:38.380
Ezekiel's wheel.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.884
Wait, I know what this reminds me of.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.640
It's like the machine at the end of <i>Contact.</i>

17:43.729 --> 17:45.015
I love that movie.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.774
Okay to go.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.947
Okay to go.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.192
- Initiate drop sequence.
- Okay to go!

17:59.287 --> 18:02.371
Oh, my God, Oh, my God. I think
I'm going through a wormhole!

18:08.087 --> 18:09.453
Okay.

18:13.676 --> 18:16.214
I don't want
to seem ungrateful for all the help,

18:16.304 --> 18:17.840
but what are we doing here?

18:19.140 --> 18:21.473
We should be, like, breaking into Area-51.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.936
Can you tell us
your name and what you do here?

18:27.023 --> 18:31.108
My name is Tony Duncan,
I'm from the Apache Nation.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.855
For the most part,
we do a lot of story-telling.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.947
A lot of our stories of creation talk about

18:37.033 --> 18:39.867
how at one time we were up in the lights,

18:39.952 --> 18:44.071
up in the sky world, so maybe it was
one of our peoples up there.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.827
So, you saw the lights last week?

18:45.916 --> 18:49.250
I didn't see them.
I didn't see them... that exact time,

18:49.337 --> 18:51.829
um, but I just heard
everyone's different stories.

18:51.922 --> 18:55.256
But then eventually, you know,
I seen all the footage of it.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.551
<i>I first thought of the star people.</i>

18:57.637 --> 19:00.675
<i>"That must be them, our relatives."</i>

19:00.765 --> 19:03.007
You said you didn't see them that exact time.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.264
- What did you mean?
- Yeah. Actually, um...

19:06.354 --> 19:09.472
way before the lights
that were seen in Phoenix,

19:09.565 --> 19:12.228
my friend that I grew up with...
his name is Pony...

19:13.611 --> 19:16.274
we actually seen some lights in the same way,

19:16.364 --> 19:18.196
but they were a lot closer,
and we followed them.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.989
- Wait.
- You saw the same formation?

19:20.076 --> 19:22.489
Yeah, yeah. They were in the sky,
and they were actually...

19:22.578 --> 19:24.820
they'd be here and then
they would take off really fast,

19:24.914 --> 19:26.621
and they would move around,

19:26.707 --> 19:29.950
and it was really exciting,
and then it went way out into the field.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.411
Like, we were running way out
into the field for a long time,

19:32.505 --> 19:34.371
our legs were getting all scratched up.

19:34.465 --> 19:37.003
Eventually, it just took off.

19:37.093 --> 19:40.006
Away, high upward. Just...
we couldn't see it anymore.

19:40.096 --> 19:44.340
Uh, but we still talk about that, Pony and I.

19:44.433 --> 19:48.222
Uh, but that was off over in Salt River,
in the Salt River Reservation.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.181
The bus definitely doesn't go that far.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.402
That's where we're going.

19:57.488 --> 20:00.105
Well, that's where we're
deciding if we should go,

20:00.199 --> 20:03.067
to be more accurate.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.278
Are you serious?
What, are you scared of sky people?

20:06.372 --> 20:07.954
Of being taken to the spirit world

20:08.040 --> 20:09.656
- with the Anasazi.
- Well, I kind of believed him.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.580
Please come.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.246
I need my producer, you know.

20:19.009 --> 20:21.467
I think it would make
a really sick documentary.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.671
I'll show it to colleges or... somebody.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.434
How do we get there?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.022
That's for me.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.645
Okay. Mark!

20:36.736 --> 20:38.728
- Mrs. Bishop.
- I haven't seen you in so long.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.608
- I know, how are you?
- Good, how are you?

20:40.698 --> 20:42.109
Hey.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.360
- You look great.
- Thank you.

20:43.451 --> 20:46.615
- Did you do something with your hair?
- Oh. Just got it done.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.195
- Are you serious?
- Thanks for noticing.

20:48.289 --> 20:50.155
- No problem.
- Can you stop flirting with my mom?

20:50.249 --> 20:52.161
I'm not flirting with your mom.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.708
She does look pretty good though.

20:56.547 --> 20:57.879
All right, go.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.919
And let's not forget our most important
piece of equipment on this journey...

21:02.803 --> 21:05.341
my 1994 Grand Jeep Cherokee.

21:05.431 --> 21:09.721
Six-cylinder engine,
blood-red finish, roof racks...

21:09.810 --> 21:13.099
16-inch clearance, perfect for maneuvering
over any desert...

21:16.901 --> 21:17.937
Sorry.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.562
<i>...phenomenon has returned.</i>

21:22.656 --> 21:24.318
- Oh, shit.
<i>- For the second time in one week,</i>

21:24.408 --> 21:26.866
<i>mysterious lights have been spotted</i>
<i>over the Phoenix area...</i>

21:26.952 --> 21:29.786
- Yo, Mark! Look at this!
<i>- ...this time, over the suburb of Mesa.</i>

21:29.872 --> 21:31.738
<i>The sightings fascinated residents.</i>

21:31.832 --> 21:33.994
<i>It was completely silent.</i>
<i>You couldn't hear it,</i>

21:34.084 --> 21:37.327
<i>but you knew it was there.</i>
<i>It was just massive, it was big.</i>

21:37.421 --> 21:40.334
<i>Eye-witnesses</i>
<i>describe what they saw as being identical</i>

21:40.424 --> 21:43.041
<i>to the glowing orbs that passed</i>
<i>through the area earlier this week...</i>

21:43.135 --> 21:45.001
Is that them? Are those your aliens?

21:45.095 --> 21:47.678
<i>...a mysterious "V" formation</i>
<i>that flew from west to east.</i>

21:47.765 --> 21:50.348
<i>- The video you're seeing right now...</i>
- Dude, I know where this is.

21:50.434 --> 21:51.641
<i>...captured in Mesa</i>
<i>about ten miles from the...</i>

21:52.978 --> 21:56.562
Wait, this is it, here on the right.
Right, right, right, right! Go!

21:56.649 --> 21:58.356
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Shit. Let me know

21:58.442 --> 22:00.729
a little earlier next time.

22:02.488 --> 22:03.854
Jeez, man.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.275
Dang.

22:13.415 --> 22:16.453
This is it. This is where
they were, right over that ridge.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.086
Well...

22:20.172 --> 22:22.004
whatever they were, they're long gone now.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.299
Dude.

22:30.766 --> 22:31.927
Well, dude, check this out.

22:34.728 --> 22:35.809
Somebody's up there.

22:38.566 --> 22:41.934
You do realize we gotta get up
in, like, six hours, right?

22:42.027 --> 22:43.609
Dude, we're almost to the top.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.487
All right.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.445
Whoa!

22:49.535 --> 22:50.776
Get down.

22:54.832 --> 22:57.791
Dude, kill the light.
What are you doing? Josh?

23:04.633 --> 23:06.295
Josh, let's get the hell out of here.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.592
Just hang on.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.261
Man, those are cops up there.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.138
Dude, there's no plates.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.719
I don't care, let's go.

23:25.154 --> 23:27.271
They're just cops.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.947
Dude, cops don't walk around in
the middle of the night with telescopes.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.279
They're looking for it.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.243
What?

23:38.334 --> 23:40.621
- The UFO.
- Josh, I don't care. Let's go.

23:40.711 --> 23:43.249
- That's what they're looking for.
- Oh, my God.

23:45.174 --> 23:46.710
- Hey!
- Oh shit!

23:46.800 --> 23:48.086
Run, bitch!

23:48.177 --> 23:49.634
Run! Come on!

23:55.392 --> 24:00.137
Okay, so this is the first sighting
right above South Mountain.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.096
This is the second.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.018
And this is where we're going,

24:06.111 --> 24:08.444
right in the flight path of the first two.
Nobody knows about this.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.400
I told you.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.198
I guess we'll find out tomorrow.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.288
<i>This was an unusual case.</i>

24:19.375 --> 24:21.332
What do you mean
it was unusual? In what sense?

24:21.418 --> 24:24.582
Uh, well... it's very uncommon to have
three kids go missing at the same time.

24:24.672 --> 24:26.789
- Just because there were three of them?
- There were three, yeah.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.919
It is usually one, maybe two,

24:29.009 --> 24:32.218
<i>boyfriend-girlfriend,</i>
<i>but the fact that there were three,</i>

24:32.304 --> 24:34.261
<i>you know, set it outside of the norm.</i>

24:36.517 --> 24:38.224
<i>What did you guys use to get to drink?</i>

24:38.310 --> 24:43.226
I always got lemonade but Mark,
he'd always go for a suicide.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.773
All the way down. Dash of everything.

24:49.196 --> 24:52.655
Do you remember
the night that you got the call?

24:54.410 --> 24:56.652
Sure. Yeah. Um...

24:56.745 --> 24:59.283
<i>I was in my first year at ASU,</i>

24:59.373 --> 25:01.615
<i>and I got a call late at night from my mom</i>

25:01.709 --> 25:03.826
<i>saying that Mark hadn't come home.</i>

25:06.463 --> 25:10.924
<i>My dad was convinced that l'd taken him</i>
<i>to some frat party and gotten him drunk.</i>

25:11.844 --> 25:13.255
<i>He was pissed off.</i>

25:14.847 --> 25:16.509
<i>He was even more pissed than Ashley's dad,</i>

25:16.598 --> 25:19.181
<i>if you can believe that.</i>

25:19.268 --> 25:22.852
<i>My mom told me that if I just got</i>
<i>them home ASAP, I wouldn't get in trouble.</i>

25:24.023 --> 25:26.140
<i>They just... they refused to believe me.</i>

25:27.860 --> 25:29.396
<i>I didn't realize at the time that I was</i>

25:29.486 --> 25:31.569
<i>the last reasonable explanation that they had</i>

25:31.655 --> 25:34.398
before they started to freak out for real.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.863
<i>Officer...</i>

25:38.954 --> 25:40.365
<i>Is someone there?</i>

25:40.456 --> 25:43.870
<i>Possible 11-24 on the side of the highway.</i>

25:45.919 --> 25:48.662
<i>No, no one inside.</i>

25:48.756 --> 25:51.169
<i>- Copy that, 11-24.</i>
<i>- 10-4.</i>

25:57.431 --> 25:59.388
Should I put my phone in airplane mode?

25:59.475 --> 26:01.307
<i>It won't affect the flight at all</i>

26:01.393 --> 26:03.385
<i>- if you don't put it in.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

26:03.479 --> 26:06.313
<i>- I use that on planes.</i>
<i>- Yeah, that's bull crap.</i>

26:18.368 --> 26:20.735
<i>The reason I wanted to talk</i>
<i>to you was because you were involved</i>

26:20.829 --> 26:23.663
- in the search for my brother.
- I was.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.992
Um, can you tell me
a little bit about... about that?

26:27.711 --> 26:28.918
Strange case.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.710
<i>That's where the car was found.</i>

26:32.800 --> 26:34.086
<i>Right down there?</i>

26:40.724 --> 26:43.808
Do you think someone could have
forced them off the road?

26:43.894 --> 26:46.307
It's possible, but I doubt it.

26:46.396 --> 26:50.106
<i>It seems like they left</i>
<i>the car here intentionally.</i>

26:50.192 --> 26:51.933
<i>What do you mean, "intentionally"?</i>

26:52.027 --> 26:54.986
Oh, the car was parked perfectly in line,

26:55.072 --> 26:57.815
so it didn't seem like
they were in a rush or anything.

26:59.785 --> 27:03.278
<i>The doors were locked.</i>
<i>We didn't find the keys.</i>

27:03.372 --> 27:04.988
It was functional. It... it ran.

27:05.082 --> 27:08.166
It wasn't like it ran out of gas
or the battery died out there.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.459
They were able to start it up.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.958
<i>And we found some beers in the car.</i>

27:12.047 --> 27:14.084
Some beers? Like, they were drinking?

27:14.174 --> 27:17.884
Yeah. Just a couple of beers. We really
don't know if that means anything.

27:19.263 --> 27:23.348
<i>There were traces of blood,</i>
<i>and we think it was Mark's.</i>

27:25.978 --> 27:27.389
<i>And your brother's camera, of course.</i>

27:33.360 --> 27:35.101
This is the one they found in the car.

27:40.868 --> 27:45.112
The Diamondbacks are
the snakes that you want to look out for.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.696
Some dude died.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.992
I guess he was climbing over, like, a ridge

27:50.085 --> 27:52.202
and it struck, and it hit him in the neck.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.126
You dick!

27:56.216 --> 27:58.048
What?

27:58.135 --> 27:59.922
Are you serious? What about her parents, huh?

28:00.012 --> 28:01.548
You're the one who wants to hit the road.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.425
You want to get in trouble
before we even leave?

28:03.515 --> 28:04.881
- God.
- Now she comes out.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.096
Well. I guess it worked.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.180
It's 7:30 in the morning, you dicks.

28:11.273 --> 28:13.435
All right, well, there's a lot of dicks

28:13.525 --> 28:14.982
getting thrown at the driver right now.

28:15.068 --> 28:17.776
- What?
- All right, you guys ready?

28:25.329 --> 28:27.446
- Josh, do you have all the equipment?
- Can you move your camera?

28:27.539 --> 28:29.121
Yeah, no, we're good, we're good.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.040
Are you sure we shouldn't double check?

28:31.126 --> 28:32.742
'Cause once we're gone, we're gone.

28:32.836 --> 28:35.670
- Okay, go, go. Please drive.
- What?

28:35.756 --> 28:38.294
- It's just I don't want to talk to my dad.
- He looks like a sweet man.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.466
Yeah, until you meet him.

28:42.262 --> 28:43.753
Wait, when do you guys have to be home by?

28:43.847 --> 28:46.885
My parents aren't as concerned.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.467
My mom just like won't go
to sleep until I'm home.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.470
Different when you're a girl...

28:52.564 --> 28:55.181
- No, no, a hundred percent.
- ...with two men.

28:55.275 --> 28:57.232
- Hey look! Look, Josh.
- It would say Interstate.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.936
Look at this. It looks like
those petroglyphs in that book.

29:00.030 --> 29:02.022
- Those were clearly made...
- Quick, shoot that.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.105
...by alien spacecraft.

29:05.118 --> 29:10.705
<i># Arizona, take off your hobo shoes #</i>

29:10.791 --> 29:15.161
<i># Arizona, hey, won'tcha go my way #</i>

29:15.254 --> 29:17.462
I can tell 'em a little something.

29:17.547 --> 29:20.415
<i># Unh, Arizona, Unh #</i>

29:20.509 --> 29:22.922
<i># So hot and fresh, giving me a boner #</i>

29:23.011 --> 29:24.752
<i># Unh, rock and roller #</i>

29:24.846 --> 29:27.714
<i># Unh, bowler, Coca-Cola #</i>

29:27.808 --> 29:29.470
<i># Solar plexus #</i>

29:29.559 --> 29:31.516
<i># 'Cause we're better than Texas #</i>

29:31.603 --> 29:33.515
<i># 'Cause we're so big and fierce #</i>

29:33.605 --> 29:35.141
<i># Call us T-Rexes #</i>

29:35.232 --> 29:38.066
<i># Look at our faces,</i>
<i>I know you wanna sex us! #</i>

29:38.151 --> 29:39.483
Whoo!

29:39.569 --> 29:44.405
<i># Arizona, take off your rainbow shades #</i>

29:44.491 --> 29:47.700
<i># Arizona,</i>
<i>have another look at the world... #</i>

29:54.584 --> 29:58.453
<i>What happened between here</i>
<i>and when they left the car...</i>

29:58.547 --> 30:00.163
<i>you see that's the mystery.</i>

30:07.723 --> 30:12.058
<i>Wouldn't know if it was</i>
<i>a couple of hours or maybe a whole day.</i>

30:12.144 --> 30:14.386
That's the hole we're trying to fill.

30:18.150 --> 30:21.191
<i>Another day in the desert,
searching for clues for three missing teens.</i>

30:21.278 --> 30:24.237
So the ground search was odd,
'cause it turned up almost nothing.

30:24.323 --> 30:26.565
Normally in a case like that
where people turn up missing

30:26.658 --> 30:30.902
and then we find a vehicle,
um, they locate something.

30:30.996 --> 30:34.489
And there were no effective trails
that led us one direction or another

30:34.583 --> 30:36.449
and even when they used their dogs out there.

30:36.543 --> 30:39.536
<i>After two days of searching,</i>
<i>a small army of law officers</i>

30:39.629 --> 30:41.586
<i>are setting up camp</i>
<i>alongside a desert highway.</i>

30:41.673 --> 30:43.335
<i>People that are on the ground tell you that,</i>

30:43.425 --> 30:46.259
"Hey, the one gal has
a bright yellow shirt or something."

30:46.345 --> 30:49.088
So that's something that you're gonna
try to key on as looking down.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.640
<i>And you just go back and forth,</i>

30:52.726 --> 30:54.217
kind of like mowing the yard.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.640
It looks very flat from the air,

31:00.734 --> 31:03.351
<i>but when you get down on the ground</i>
<i>and you start walking around</i>

31:03.445 --> 31:08.861
<i>even the smallest bit of terrain, there is</i>
<i>a lot of... lot of places they could be.</i>

31:08.950 --> 31:11.192
Now anyone with any information
about this case

31:11.286 --> 31:12.868
is asked to call a special tip line...

31:14.039 --> 31:16.076
<i>If you'd have asked me</i>
<i>at the front end, "Are we going</i>

31:16.166 --> 31:18.658
to find these kids," I would have said,
"Yeah. Oh, yeah, we'll find them."

31:18.752 --> 31:21.369
<i>Three things to look for. Three shirts.</i>

31:21.463 --> 31:23.750
I don't want to be morbid, but three bodies.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.503
I mean, there's-there's more...
there's more to search for.

31:27.469 --> 31:28.835
<i>We just found nothing.</i>

31:30.263 --> 31:32.880
<i>So if you were to speculate,</i>
<i>what do you think happened to them?</i>

31:32.974 --> 31:35.182
Maybe if I wasn't on camera or something,

31:35.268 --> 31:37.760
I think maybe I could give you some opinions,

31:37.854 --> 31:39.720
but, um, it's hard to speculate.

31:41.608 --> 31:44.476
Okay, so what do you think happened?

31:44.569 --> 31:47.482
<i>There's potentially some sort</i>
<i>of relationship issue.</i>

31:47.572 --> 31:50.030
One boy likes the girl,
and the girl likes the other boy,

31:50.117 --> 31:53.155
and the two boys find out about the issue.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.407
<i>Maybe somebody came along and picked them up</i>

31:55.497 --> 31:58.535
and could have taken them somewhere,
but they should have surfaced.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.082
<i>Foul play is possible,</i>

32:00.168 --> 32:02.205
but it's very tough
if only one person did it.

32:02.295 --> 32:05.254
It's very difficult to hold three people,
you know, together.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.707
<i>It could just be someone</i>
<i>out there that's running some dope.</i>

32:07.801 --> 32:09.793
<i>They were just</i>
<i>in the wrong place at the wrong time.</i>

32:09.886 --> 32:12.299
<i>Wrong place wrong time.</i>
<i>Stumble upon something that was five miles</i>

32:12.389 --> 32:14.176
<i>from where they were,</i>
<i>where the vehicle was located,</i>

32:14.266 --> 32:15.632
<i>and they were driven to that loca...</i>

32:16.977 --> 32:20.345
Like I said, we didn't find anything,
so who knows what happened?

32:20.439 --> 32:21.896
Hard to speculate.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.236
How did you meet Josh?

32:29.322 --> 32:31.939
I feel weird talking about this,
'cause I know he's gonna watch it later.

32:32.033 --> 32:35.151
We met, uh... we met in church actually.

32:35.245 --> 32:36.781
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:36.872 --> 32:41.287
Everybody called Josh, "Ginger,"
and they were making fun of him,

32:41.376 --> 32:43.333
like, calling him "Ginger"
because of his red hair,

32:43.420 --> 32:46.629
but when I was little, I didn't know
"Ginger" was a name for redheads.

32:46.715 --> 32:50.504
I just thought it was a nickname,
like, specifically for Josh.

32:50.594 --> 32:54.508
So I just thought the coolest kid at
Sunday school... everybody knew who he was,

32:54.598 --> 32:56.339
so I went out of my way to hang out with him.

32:56.433 --> 32:59.050
That's when we started becoming friends.

32:59.144 --> 33:00.476
Oh, nice.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.814
I just got some B-roll,
but I got some really cool cactuses...

33:04.900 --> 33:07.233
Were you guys filming me while I was asleep?

33:07.319 --> 33:08.981
- No.
- No. Never.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.437
Okay, a little bit.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.693
- Can you put your seatbelt back on?
- Yeah.

33:16.244 --> 33:18.577
- Yeah.
- Literally nothing out here.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.494
Hello!

33:25.378 --> 33:27.620
You're gonna get
your head taken off by one of those.

33:30.717 --> 33:33.175
- I wanna live here.
- You wanna live here?

33:33.261 --> 33:35.719
Yeah. Maybe.

33:35.805 --> 33:37.467
Whoa, whoa, watch out!

33:37.557 --> 33:40.470
- God!
- Sorry, guys. My bad.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.597
- Whoa, check that out.
- What? What is it?

33:42.687 --> 33:45.725
Dead animal. A coyote?

33:45.815 --> 33:47.977
- Is it two?
- Yeah.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.900
- Yeah, it is.
- Hold on, this camera sucks.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.022
- So that's it?
- That's it.

33:55.116 --> 33:57.859
That's the last he shot.

33:57.953 --> 34:00.320
Hang on. So Josh went all the way out there

34:00.413 --> 34:02.370
and then just didn't shoot
anything past the road?

34:02.457 --> 34:03.868
Doesn't that seem weird to you?

34:07.754 --> 34:09.837
<i>I always thought it was a little odd.</i>

34:09.922 --> 34:11.505
<i>Why? Why odd?</i>

34:11.591 --> 34:13.297
Well, your brother...

34:13.385 --> 34:17.049
He seemed to have that camera
glued to his face all the time.

34:17.138 --> 34:19.596
<i>It-It just didn't make</i>
<i>any sense to leave it behind.</i>

34:21.976 --> 34:24.264
So do you think
maybe they had a second camera?

34:24.353 --> 34:25.594
Like, is that a possibility?

34:25.688 --> 34:27.179
I thought about that.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.891
I-I still think your brother
would have had that with him.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.772
<i>I know Ashley had access</i>

34:31.860 --> 34:34.228
<i>to those camera equipment</i>
<i>and could check out,</i>

34:34.322 --> 34:38.657
<i>but I don't remember anything</i>
<i>being unaccounted for at the time.</i>

34:38.743 --> 34:41.360
<i>We... we ran that thread out</i>
<i>as far as we could,</i>

34:41.454 --> 34:44.659
and we just couldn't take it, and law
enforcement couldn't take it anywhere either.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.458
So that's what the kids would
have been using back in '97, right?

34:51.547 --> 34:53.630
It's a little before my time,

34:53.717 --> 34:56.710
but yeah, probably.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.965
Do you still have any
of those old cameras laying around?

34:59.639 --> 35:00.720
Yeah.

35:04.519 --> 35:06.932
<i>I'm Ashley Foster, CPTV.</i>

35:07.022 --> 35:09.435
<i>Just want to say hello to all</i>
<i>the new freshmen in the building.</i>

35:09.524 --> 35:10.765
Where did you get this?

35:10.859 --> 35:13.021
This was found in Mark Abrams' Jeep

35:13.111 --> 35:16.070
after he went missing
with Ashley and with my brother.

35:16.156 --> 35:18.569
We think Josh had
a second camera with him on the trip.

35:18.658 --> 35:21.401
If he did have one,
it most likely came from the school,

35:21.494 --> 35:24.157
so I was wondering if you thought Ashley
could have checked one out from here,

35:24.247 --> 35:26.159
like, maybe she used a different name?

35:26.249 --> 35:29.868
It's possible, but like I said,
it was before I started.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.419
Would there have been, like,
a logbook or records of that?

35:32.505 --> 35:34.417
- Like, stuff that might have been...
- It's been 20 years.

35:35.884 --> 35:38.046
I'm so sorry I can't be of more help to you.

35:40.805 --> 35:44.094
Even if they had a second camera,
it just... it went missing with them.

35:48.021 --> 35:49.683
Just another dead end, you know?

35:52.942 --> 35:54.524
<i>And new developments tonight.</i>

35:54.611 --> 35:57.820
<i>Rescuers were forced to call off</i>
<i>their search for three missing teens,</i>

35:57.906 --> 36:00.990
<i>saying there was "no new</i>
<i>credible evidence or clues</i>

36:01.076 --> 36:02.738
<i>to guide the search."</i>

36:02.827 --> 36:04.363
It's like they've been written off.

36:04.454 --> 36:08.322
They've been... my son and his friends have
been abandoned by the police department.

36:08.416 --> 36:09.907
<i>All the efforts by law enforcement</i>

36:10.001 --> 36:11.788
<i>to develop some evidence as to what happened,</i>

36:11.878 --> 36:14.791
they were pretty... well, they were negative.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.123
They could never go anywhere with the case.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.089
I think if they had kids, they'd want
somebody looking for their kid.

36:30.939 --> 36:32.555
<i>Dear Ashley,</i>

36:34.275 --> 36:36.267
<i>I know that you're alive...</i>

36:36.361 --> 36:39.399
<i>and that you can hear my voice right now.</i>

36:41.241 --> 36:45.360
<i>You can't imagine how much your father</i>
<i>and I miss you... and love you.</i>

36:47.789 --> 36:49.781
<i>Every night, I have a dream</i>

36:49.874 --> 36:53.208
<i>that I come downstairs</i>
<i>and you're sitting at the table</i>

36:53.294 --> 36:54.705
<i>like you were never even gone.</i>

36:56.256 --> 36:58.293
<i>I know this means something.</i>

36:58.383 --> 37:02.798
<i>I know it means that you... are still alive.</i>

37:04.681 --> 37:07.549
<i>Your father and I will never give up hope.</i>

37:07.642 --> 37:10.726
<i>I love you, Ashley. Please come home.</i>

37:17.402 --> 37:18.893
<i>I wanted a funeral...</i>

37:20.947 --> 37:23.439
<i>but Jack wouldn't have it.</i>

37:23.533 --> 37:25.695
So, here we are.

37:28.163 --> 37:29.779
The bench was a compromise?

37:29.873 --> 37:31.865
Yep. That's what marriage is about.

37:50.393 --> 37:52.851
It's... uh... Sophie, I don't...

37:52.937 --> 37:54.553
I don't think your brother's alive.

37:54.647 --> 37:56.980
I-I... I don't think... I don't think he is.

37:57.066 --> 37:58.477
I think something would have developed.

38:02.739 --> 38:04.150
<i>Jay, get in here.</i>

38:06.785 --> 38:08.401
- What's up?
- Have you seen this?

38:12.040 --> 38:15.124
<i>If you'd been here ten years ago</i>
<i>and standing out here and looking up there</i>

38:15.210 --> 38:17.418
<i>at the lights and the view, um,</i>

38:17.504 --> 38:19.416
<i>you would have been astounded.</i>
<i>You would have been amazed.</i>

38:19.506 --> 38:22.670
- Is that the governor?
- Yeah.

38:22.759 --> 38:25.001
Twenty years ago,
he said the lights were a joke.

38:25.094 --> 38:27.882
He had a whole press conference
making fun of them.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.884
And now he's saying
he saw the lights that night.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.340
<i>I got four of 'em.</i>

38:31.434 --> 38:33.426
He's basically admitting he lied.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.183
<i>The former governor,</i>
<i>a Vietnam Air Force veteran,</i>

38:36.272 --> 38:39.811
<i>had never publicly</i>
<i>acknowledged seeing it until now.</i>

38:39.901 --> 38:41.767
And I suspect that...

38:41.861 --> 38:44.899
unless the Defense Department
proves this otherwise,

38:44.989 --> 38:48.448
that it was probably some form
of an alien spacecraft.

38:48.535 --> 38:52.370
<i>And I think as a public figure, you have</i>
<i>to be very careful about what you say,</i>

38:52.455 --> 38:56.699
<i>because people can have</i>
<i>pretty emotional reactions.</i>

39:08.721 --> 39:09.837
Is that him?

39:14.894 --> 39:16.681
Okay, follow me and just keep rolling.

39:22.819 --> 39:23.809
Excuse me, Mr. Garland?

39:25.154 --> 39:26.770
Hi, I'm Sophie Bishop. We spoke on the phone.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.527
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.573
Right, I just have a couple questions.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.744
You worked for the governor from 1992
until he resigned in '97, is that right?

39:33.830 --> 39:35.947
Sophie, I don't know anything
about your brother.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.406
Okay, what about the Phoenix Lights?

39:37.500 --> 39:39.742
On March 15th, 1997, you went on TV,

39:39.836 --> 39:41.828
and you said that they were military flares.

39:41.921 --> 39:44.834
Did you see the Governor
on CNN saying that was a lie?

39:44.924 --> 39:46.290
You were his press secretary at the time.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.046
Listen, I really am very sorry
about your brother.

39:48.136 --> 39:49.798
We were just trying not to create a panic.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.424
Who told you to lie?

39:55.268 --> 39:57.180
I mean, what if Josh was on to something?

39:58.813 --> 40:01.396
We always assumed he got lost
or kidnapped or...

40:03.610 --> 40:05.727
murdered but what if...

40:07.071 --> 40:08.858
What if he got abducted by aliens?

40:12.702 --> 40:14.614
Jesus, I sound like him, don't I?

40:17.040 --> 40:19.373
So... now what?

40:22.211 --> 40:23.292
I don't know.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.749
I don't know what we're doing here anymore.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.137
<i>Can't believe you're leaving.</i>

40:38.227 --> 40:39.513
It feels like you just got here.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.351
Can I ask you one more question?

40:46.527 --> 40:48.735
Why did you and Dad decide to call it quits?

40:50.406 --> 40:52.363
Sweetheart, everyone's divorced now.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.567
I want to know. Was it Josh's disappearance

40:54.661 --> 40:57.699
or would you guys have split up anyway?

41:13.846 --> 41:16.839
<i>Hello!</i>

41:16.933 --> 41:19.141
<i>You're going to get</i>
<i>your head taken off by one of those.</i>

41:19.227 --> 41:20.763
<i>I want to live here.</i>

41:20.853 --> 41:23.721
<i>- You want to live here?</i>
<i>- Yeah. Maybe.</i>

41:25.316 --> 41:26.932
<i>Josh, you want to stop here?</i>

41:43.626 --> 41:45.367
- Well, how is she?
- She's good.

41:45.461 --> 41:48.124
Just getting ready
for the big move, you know.

41:48.214 --> 41:52.253
Well, please tell her, you know, if she needs
any help or anything, she should call me.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.303
Somebody knows what happened.

41:59.267 --> 42:01.054
<i>Mark didn't just wander off into the desert.</i>

42:01.144 --> 42:02.510
<i>He didn't get lost.</i>

42:02.603 --> 42:04.344
That never made sense to me.

42:09.610 --> 42:11.602
<i>If Josh hadn't gone missing...</i>

42:11.696 --> 42:13.528
do you think you and Mom
would still be together?

42:14.323 --> 42:15.313
Yeah.

42:16.617 --> 42:17.983
What'd she say?

42:18.077 --> 42:20.194
Sweetheart, what happened was
your brother went missing.

42:21.164 --> 42:22.405
Completely missing.

42:23.332 --> 42:25.073
And it took over our lives.

42:26.085 --> 42:28.122
<i>...resources to make sure</i>
<i>these teenagers are found.</i>

42:34.844 --> 42:37.302
If that's true, then what was it,

42:37.388 --> 42:39.050
<i>you know? I don't know.</i>

42:39.140 --> 42:41.507
<i>Is Josh dead? Is he alive?</i>

42:42.435 --> 42:43.721
<i>Was he suffering?</i>

42:43.811 --> 42:48.351
Our relationship became about
all those questions,

42:48.441 --> 42:50.023
<i>and your father, he couldn't do it anymore</i>

42:50.109 --> 42:52.146
and still be the man
that I fell in love with,

42:52.236 --> 42:54.444
and I couldn't do it anymore
and still be his wife.

42:59.368 --> 43:02.361
<i>Everybody keeps criticizing me</i>
<i>for, you know, not dealing with it.</i>

43:02.455 --> 43:04.663
I was the only one who was still out there

43:04.749 --> 43:06.581
trying to figure out
what happened to your brother.

43:10.213 --> 43:12.956
<i>Do you think there's ever going to</i>
<i>be a point where you can let it go, Dad?</i>

43:16.761 --> 43:18.673
I mean, show... show me his body.

43:26.521 --> 43:28.478
- Good to see you.
- Love you.

43:28.564 --> 43:30.897
- I love you, too.
- Okay.

43:30.983 --> 43:33.270
All right. Do me a favor:
When you get home, give me a call, okay?

43:33.361 --> 43:34.818
- Okay.
- Let me know you got in okay.

43:34.904 --> 43:36.111
- Yeah.
- Okay.

43:36.197 --> 43:38.530
- We're going to see you Christmas?
- Yeah, I'll see you Christmas.

43:38.616 --> 43:39.823
- Okay.
- Okay.

43:39.909 --> 43:41.070
- All right.
- Love you.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.401
I love you.

43:42.495 --> 43:43.827
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

44:01.722 --> 44:04.089
<i>Hi, Sophie, this is Luisa. Luisa Moreno.</i>

44:04.183 --> 44:06.846
<i>We spoke several months ago</i>
<i>at Canyon Park High.</i>

44:06.936 --> 44:10.805
<i>Um... just call me back when you can.</i>

44:11.941 --> 44:13.352
Hi.

44:15.403 --> 44:17.360
- Thank you so much for meeting me.
- Yeah.

44:19.073 --> 44:20.484
Did you have a hard time finding the place?

44:20.575 --> 44:22.191
- No, no, not at all.
- Great.

44:23.327 --> 44:26.536
This place has been on the books
since the late '70s.

44:26.622 --> 44:29.660
Pretty much anything old
or outdated gets thrown in here.

44:29.750 --> 44:31.958
I was throwing away
some garbage over the weekend

44:32.044 --> 44:34.787
and just saw it sitting in the drawer.

44:34.881 --> 44:36.964
Somebody must have thrown it
in here and forgotten about it.

45:06.412 --> 45:08.529
- Can I take this?
- Oh, it's yours.

45:20.301 --> 45:22.543
I know you're excited about this, but...

45:24.597 --> 45:26.805
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up, you know?

45:26.891 --> 45:27.881
Yeah, I know.

45:32.230 --> 45:33.346
Is that a tape?

45:34.398 --> 45:35.809
- Be careful.
- I know.

45:37.944 --> 45:39.401
Okay.

45:39.487 --> 45:41.695
- That's Ashley's handwriting.
- Really?

45:51.999 --> 45:53.535
Holy shit.

45:58.839 --> 46:00.171
Hit play.

46:02.885 --> 46:04.547
I'm going to let you do this.

46:04.637 --> 46:05.923
All right, you ready?

46:06.847 --> 46:08.008
Ready.

46:20.987 --> 46:23.855
Soph? Sophie?

47:07.867 --> 47:08.732
Hi.

47:10.119 --> 47:12.361
Sophie Bishop.
I have an appointment with Captain Groves.

47:12.455 --> 47:13.696
IDs please.

47:30.639 --> 47:32.551
Just pull over to the side, ma'am.

47:32.641 --> 47:34.132
I need you to wait right over there.

47:34.226 --> 47:36.388
Okay. Is there a problem?
We should have an appointment.

47:36.479 --> 47:38.141
Yes ma'am.
I need you to wait right over there.

47:38.230 --> 47:39.516
Okay.

47:45.988 --> 47:47.479
What's it been, like an hour?

47:57.750 --> 47:59.582
That's him.

47:59.668 --> 48:03.628
Okay, uh, just stay here, keep it low.

48:06.175 --> 48:07.711
- Miss Bishop?
- Hi.

48:08.135 --> 48:09.216
Hi there.

48:14.767 --> 48:16.975
So we can do the interview
out here or in your office,

48:17.061 --> 48:18.518
whichever you prefer.

48:18.604 --> 48:19.845
It's not gonna happen.

48:24.527 --> 48:28.020
Okay, but... when we spoke on the phone,
you said that it was fine,

48:28.114 --> 48:31.403
so I guess I'm just wondering what
happened that made you change your mind.

48:31.492 --> 48:33.074
I understand.

48:35.788 --> 48:37.324
Did you watch the footage?

48:48.426 --> 48:49.542
Drive safe.

49:03.691 --> 49:04.898
You okay?

49:04.984 --> 49:07.271
Yeah, I just honestly wasn't expecting that.

49:07.361 --> 49:09.774
What did he say?

49:09.864 --> 49:12.072
He said, "Don't let that footage get out."

49:15.244 --> 49:16.701
What do you want to do?

49:21.000 --> 49:22.411
What do you think Josh would do?

49:32.011 --> 49:33.343
This is gonna be rad.

49:35.473 --> 49:36.714
Dude.

49:37.766 --> 49:39.974
- Yeah.
- Look at its eye.

49:40.060 --> 49:41.847
- Yeah.
- This camera is amazing.

49:41.937 --> 49:44.145
- Yo, don't get too close.
- It smells burnt.

49:44.231 --> 49:46.314
It's like males competing for females.

49:48.194 --> 49:49.560
They have the same burns.

49:49.653 --> 49:51.440
Countless stories when UFOs
have been sighted about,

49:51.530 --> 49:53.362
like, animal experimentation.

49:53.449 --> 49:55.236
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.

49:55.326 --> 49:57.113
They just got cooked by the sun.

49:58.871 --> 50:01.238
- Woo!
- Oh shit.

50:05.044 --> 50:06.455
This way.

50:12.134 --> 50:16.303
- Obviously I'm joking.
- You just said you look like older Leo.

50:16.388 --> 50:18.550
People told me that
when <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> came out.

50:19.767 --> 50:20.883
What, they said that you...

50:20.976 --> 50:23.593
That literally made me
more popular in school.

50:23.687 --> 50:25.303
What are you guys talking about?

50:25.397 --> 50:27.810
- What?
- What are you guys talking about?

50:27.900 --> 50:29.562
You.

50:31.529 --> 50:33.862
Just at the top of that ridge.

50:33.948 --> 50:36.281
We wouldn't be able
to see anything from down here.

50:36.367 --> 50:38.324
Not like we're gonna see
anything up there, either.

50:38.410 --> 50:41.244
Don't be that guy.

50:42.122 --> 50:44.159
We don't need that guy.

50:44.250 --> 50:45.991
You remember where we parked the car, right?

50:46.085 --> 50:49.249
Uh... yeah. It's... that a-way.

50:50.548 --> 50:51.914
- Ooh, Josh.
- Oh shit.

50:53.050 --> 50:54.131
Come look at this.

50:55.052 --> 50:56.384
- What do you got?
- Whoa.

50:57.429 --> 50:58.385
Petroglyphs.

50:59.098 --> 51:00.009
Oh!

51:00.099 --> 51:01.806
Guess this means we're on the right track.

51:03.018 --> 51:04.884
Wow. Ancient graffiti.

51:10.067 --> 51:12.525
Now what you see below me
are Native American petroglyphs.

51:12.611 --> 51:15.274
They were probably put here
hundreds of years ago

51:15.364 --> 51:17.822
by the Apache.
They were native to these lands,

51:17.908 --> 51:20.446
very adept at living
in these mountainous regions.

51:20.536 --> 51:22.118
Uh...

51:22.204 --> 51:24.571
the spiral shape that you see below us...

51:24.665 --> 51:26.907
historians aren't quite sure
what it could have represented.

51:27.001 --> 51:29.084
It could have represented ripples in water,

51:29.169 --> 51:30.785
things that they saw in the sky.

51:32.172 --> 51:35.836
And... that's pretty much it. Petroglyphs.

51:38.470 --> 51:39.756
Please be careful.

51:46.645 --> 51:48.102
- You get that?
- Yeah.

51:48.188 --> 51:49.679
- It look steep?
- Yeah.

51:51.942 --> 51:53.183
You guys are idiots.

51:59.033 --> 52:01.195
Ah, I should not have smoked that cigarette.

52:07.166 --> 52:08.282
Whoa.

52:11.879 --> 52:14.337
How far do you want us to go, Josh?

52:14.423 --> 52:15.959
Just keep going.

52:38.947 --> 52:41.906
I'm wheezing. I'm out of breath.

52:46.789 --> 52:48.075
Whoa.

52:58.008 --> 52:59.215
- You rolling?
- Yeah.

52:59.301 --> 53:01.213
Check this out. Oh, shit.

53:04.139 --> 53:05.471
Where'd you get those?

53:05.557 --> 53:06.798
Ask Diane Sawyer over there.

53:06.892 --> 53:08.633
I got it from a guy at the gas station.

53:08.727 --> 53:10.935
Here. He had a crush on you or something.

53:11.021 --> 53:12.387
I just used my eyes.

53:14.024 --> 53:16.437
- Yeah. Dude, no, no. Do not film this.
- We have two more in here.

53:31.834 --> 53:33.416
Is Josh filming this?

53:33.502 --> 53:35.164
Whoa.

53:35.254 --> 53:38.543
Will you please be as careful as possible
with that on a cliff edge.

53:38.632 --> 53:40.544
Sorry.

53:40.634 --> 53:42.967
- Where's Mark?
- He's taking a leak.

53:43.053 --> 53:44.840
Oh, you didn't want to go with him?

53:44.930 --> 53:46.341
Shut up.

53:49.268 --> 53:51.430
- What are you doing?
- It's my turn to interview you.

53:51.520 --> 53:52.636
- This is...
- See how you like it.

53:52.730 --> 53:54.187
It's not a Hitchcock movie, you know.

53:54.273 --> 53:55.889
The director isn't in this one.

53:57.568 --> 53:59.230
You guys playing Truth or Dare up here?

54:00.487 --> 54:02.103
- Want to play Truth or Dare?
- Yeah.

54:02.197 --> 54:04.029
- You go first.
- You actually want to play?

54:04.575 --> 54:05.861
- Yeah, why not?
- Come on.

54:06.618 --> 54:08.655
- I've got a couple beers in me.
- Uh... dare.

54:09.830 --> 54:12.698
Okay. I dare you to tell the truth.

54:14.418 --> 54:16.250
That is not how you play the game.

54:16.336 --> 54:18.373
- It's fair enough.
- That is how I play the game.

54:18.464 --> 54:20.956
What's. uh... what's the deal
with you and Debbie Gomez?

54:23.844 --> 54:25.426
De-Debbie Gomez?

54:27.306 --> 54:28.342
Why?

54:29.767 --> 54:31.679
Well, the old rumor mill's been, you know...

54:32.728 --> 54:34.970
We hang out sometimes. Like, I don't...

54:35.063 --> 54:37.521
You guys play tennis or go golfing?

54:37.608 --> 54:39.975
Why are you being a dick, dude?
Like, we hang out.

54:40.068 --> 54:41.980
- Like, it's not...
- Why didn't you invite her here?

54:43.155 --> 54:44.817
I don't know. I didn't want to make it weird.

54:44.907 --> 54:46.239
What do you mean, "make it weird"?

54:46.325 --> 54:47.315
Why would that be weird?

54:47.409 --> 54:49.071
I didn't want to make it like a double date.

54:49.161 --> 54:50.777
- Wait, now that's weird.
- Oh, come on, man.

54:52.122 --> 54:54.364
All right, we cannot stay here forever.

54:54.458 --> 54:56.245
We need to go as soon as the sun dips down.

54:56.335 --> 54:58.292
Just hold on and enjoy it
for a second, please.

55:01.381 --> 55:03.543
I just want to get this. It's gorgeous.

55:09.097 --> 55:11.009
- Josh.
- What?

55:11.517 --> 55:13.133
- What is that?
- What?

55:13.227 --> 55:14.684
- What?
- That.

55:16.647 --> 55:18.183
No, no, what is that?

55:20.400 --> 55:21.732
- Ashley.
- Whoa, what?

55:23.403 --> 55:26.896
- Wait, Mark, isn't that... what?
- It's just kind of sitting there.

55:26.990 --> 55:28.856
Wait,
isn't the Luke Air Force Base over there?

55:28.951 --> 55:30.283
- Yeah.
- Maybe.

55:30.369 --> 55:32.156
Probably just something
from the Air Force Base.

55:33.705 --> 55:35.697
- Maybe a helicopter.
- You're the one looking for UFOs.

55:35.791 --> 55:38.124
- No, that's not a helicopter.
- I'm just pointing it out.

55:38.210 --> 55:39.667
We'd hear it if it was a helicopter.

55:39.753 --> 55:40.743
Hold on.

55:43.674 --> 55:45.757
- Wait. Okay, you guys.
- Think it's a fighter jet?

55:45.843 --> 55:48.301
- No, that's not a fighter jet.
- Don't get ahead of yourself.

55:48.387 --> 55:49.423
It's just a light.

55:49.513 --> 55:51.004
It's not. You'd hear it, you'd hear it.

55:53.267 --> 55:54.929
What? Oh, my God.

55:55.018 --> 55:57.180
Okay. Okay.

55:57.271 --> 55:58.682
Whoa!

56:00.274 --> 56:01.981
- Holy shit!
- What!

56:02.901 --> 56:04.233
Josh, did you get that?

56:04.903 --> 56:05.984
Hold on.

56:06.655 --> 56:07.896
Oh...

56:09.533 --> 56:11.399
- What was that?
- I don't...

56:11.493 --> 56:13.155
- wait, tell me you got that on camera.
- Yes!

56:13.245 --> 56:14.235
Can you play that back?

56:16.957 --> 56:18.914
- Oh, my God! Josh.
- Guys, stop, stop, stop.

56:19.001 --> 56:21.660
- Wait, Josh, seriously though.
- This is the greatest day of my life.

56:21.753 --> 56:23.460
Oh, my... did you know that was gonna happen?

56:23.547 --> 56:24.537
Here, give me that back.

56:24.631 --> 56:26.122
Did you know that was gonna happen?

56:26.216 --> 56:27.582
Is Luke Air Force Base that way?

56:28.719 --> 56:30.756
Luke Air Force Base is that way,
but that's not Air Force.

56:30.846 --> 56:32.587
- How do you know?
- You don't know that.

56:32.681 --> 56:34.513
Because it's not 2150.

56:37.227 --> 56:38.217
Come back.

56:38.312 --> 56:39.848
- All right, man.
- Twenty minutes.

56:39.938 --> 56:41.520
Get like a last pan or whatever. Let's go.

56:41.607 --> 56:43.018
Dude, come on. I'm happy for you, let's go.

56:43.108 --> 56:45.100
- Just ten more minutes?
- You've done that twice.

56:45.193 --> 56:46.604
Do you know how hard it's gonna be

56:46.695 --> 56:48.027
to walk through this canyon in the dark?

56:48.113 --> 56:49.570
I don't see what the problem is, okay?

56:49.656 --> 56:51.318
- You know the way back.
- It's already dark.

56:52.784 --> 56:55.117
The problem is that it starts
to get really dark and really cold,

56:55.203 --> 56:57.661
and she has a curfew,
and I still have to drive.

56:57.748 --> 56:59.284
- Please.
- Come on.

56:59.374 --> 57:00.410
Cut. We gotta go.

57:00.542 --> 57:01.623
All right, we're leaving.

57:02.794 --> 57:05.457
What if we get arrested by,
like, the Air Force or something?

57:05.547 --> 57:07.709
That would actually be
the scariest situation.

57:07.799 --> 57:11.467
Like our parents don't ever find out,
like, what's going to happen to us.

57:11.553 --> 57:13.385
The Air Force just takes us away
or something.

57:14.431 --> 57:15.797
That'd be so sad.

57:18.185 --> 57:20.552
My mom would think I was just
in my room playing with the camera.

57:20.646 --> 57:22.103
They wouldn't notice?

57:22.189 --> 57:24.146
They wouldn't... like, it would take
a couple years I think.

57:24.232 --> 57:25.689
My parents are noticing right now.

57:29.905 --> 57:31.112
Oh...

57:33.450 --> 57:35.487
You good?

57:35.577 --> 57:37.113
- Yeah.
- Mark.

57:37.204 --> 57:38.445
- Mark!
- Sorry.

57:41.333 --> 57:42.744
- Whoa.
- Give it to me.

57:42.834 --> 57:44.666
Give me that. Give me the UFO.

57:45.420 --> 57:46.331
Ah!

57:47.506 --> 57:49.372
After tonight, you can be producer,

57:49.466 --> 57:50.923
assistant director.

57:52.719 --> 57:54.802
You know what?
If you're lucky, we can talk "co."

57:54.888 --> 57:56.754
- We can what?
- We can talk "co."

57:56.848 --> 57:58.180
- All right.
- Co-director.

57:58.266 --> 58:00.303
He's three years older than me.

58:00.394 --> 58:02.056
His brother voted for Dole.

58:02.145 --> 58:03.511
- No, he didn't.
- Bob Dole? Really?

58:03.605 --> 58:05.141
Yes, he did. Your brother's a moron.

58:05.232 --> 58:08.145
My brother's... are you kidding me?
He's an... he's an engineering student.

58:09.945 --> 58:12.733
He's an engineering student.
He's actually very smart.

58:15.117 --> 58:16.449
He's gonna be president one day.

58:24.292 --> 58:27.330
- Is this a dead end?
- No, you gotta keep going through.

58:27.421 --> 58:28.832
Are you sure it's not a dead end?

58:28.922 --> 58:30.914
- I'm positive it's not a dead end.
- All right.

58:31.008 --> 58:32.465
We walked through here in the daytime.

58:32.551 --> 58:34.634
- Does it usually get this tight?
- Yeah.

58:38.056 --> 58:39.888
We're good. It goes on for a while.

58:39.975 --> 58:41.216
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

58:41.309 --> 58:43.346
- You guys need help?
- It's worth being in trouble.

58:43.437 --> 58:44.803
Do you understand what we've seen today?

58:44.896 --> 58:46.888
Yeah, but I can push it like
an hour, but any longer, it's...

58:46.982 --> 58:48.939
We would've noticed these
on the way in for sure.

58:49.026 --> 58:50.688
I don't remember these.

58:50.777 --> 58:52.769
Yeah. I for sure would have noticed these.

58:53.864 --> 58:54.900
Mark, are you sure we passed...

58:56.783 --> 58:59.484
- Mark where are we going?
- Hold on, I'll be super sure, hold on.

59:04.124 --> 59:05.660
Are you sure we're going the right way?

59:05.751 --> 59:06.616
Yes!

59:08.420 --> 59:10.252
Why can't you just use the stars, man?

59:11.757 --> 59:13.248
- Josh.
- No, it's this way.

59:15.135 --> 59:16.671
- Are you positive?
- Yep.

59:16.762 --> 59:17.718
All right.

59:19.014 --> 59:20.676
- Do you guys not hear that?
- What?

59:25.687 --> 59:26.894
- What?
- Josh, come on.

59:27.773 --> 59:30.015
- Everything just looks like rocks.
- I know where we are.

59:30.108 --> 59:32.191
Yeah, but you keep going
left then right, then left then right.

59:32.277 --> 59:34.109
You keep complaining
about us being late, so can we go?

59:34.196 --> 59:35.653
I know exactly where we're going.

59:35.739 --> 59:37.480
I mean, who else are we
gonna listen to anyway?

59:38.658 --> 59:40.194
Okay, let's go. What way?

59:41.453 --> 59:43.285
Hold on. Just stop moving. Let me...

59:44.539 --> 59:45.746
look first.

59:53.256 --> 59:54.497
Well...

59:56.635 --> 59:58.467
- I definitely heard that.
- I just heard something.

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:03.468
Guys. Get down.

01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:05.850
Get down.

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:08.644
Mark, get down.

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:16.023
- What is that?
- It could be a train.

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:20.572
I-I... I didn't see any tracks out here.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:24.823
Shh. Just listen.

01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:44.713
Okay, we're almost back.

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:46.800
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Let's go.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:50.474
- Everybody walk faster.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.187
- Ash, it's all right.
- We need to get out of here now.

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:57.940
I know. Just calm down.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:02.281
Josh...

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:03.699
do you recognize any of this?

01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:07.111
- Give me the compass.
- Do you want to try?

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:08.491
- Guys!
- Yes! Give me the compass.

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:09.618
Get us home.

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:11.574
- Okay, I will. I will!
- You do it.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:17.922
Okay, so... we came from this way.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:22.376
We got this way.

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:24.086
- It's definitely not this way.
- Mark?

01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:28.557
- Mark, where you going?
- Just stay there.

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:31.226
- Mark, where you going?
- I'm gonna find the car from up here!

01:01:31.313 --> 01:01:33.555
You're not gonna see anything
up there, it's pitch black.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.272
Hey, Josh? Can you come look at this?

01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:41.688
What?

01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:44.110
It's just not working.

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:45.942
- Why would it do that?
- I don't know.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:48.323
Whoa! What is that?

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:52.914
Oh, my God. What is that?

01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:57.123
- Josh, I don't like this.
- Hold on, wait.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:59.797
Just stay still. Where is it coming from?

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.044
I don't know.

01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:02.962
- Oh!
- Ashley.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:04.464
Oh, my God.

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:08.513
Oh, my God.

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:12.934
Josh.

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:20.059
Ashley, run! Run!

01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:24.029
Oh, my God!

01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:27.574
- Get down! Get down!
- Ow!

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:29.360
Run!

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:42.965
Jesus Christ! Whoa.

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:46.294
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:49.964
Oh, my God.

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:57.471
Josh? Josh?

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.391
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, you?

01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.980
Yeah.

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:04.486
Your hands are shaking.

01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:06.943
I'm scared.

01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:09.366
- What was that?
- I don't know.

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:14.822
Oh, Mark! Are you all right?

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:18.579
Mark, tell me you saw that, man.

01:03:19.504 --> 01:03:21.086
I saw the car.

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:22.708
- You saw the what?
- I saw the car. It's close.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:23.835
You saw the car?

01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:25.632
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.970
- Mark, where are you going?
- I don't know.

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:31.763
Can we just get the hell out of here, please?

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:33.386
- No, wait!
- Mark!

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.887
- Mark!
- Let's go!

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.264
Okay, Mark, slow down!

01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:37.890
- Tell me you saw that, man.
- Hey.

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:39.643
Can we just get the hell out of here, please?

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:41.440
I think we should have a group huddle first.

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:42.516
Mark, what was that?

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:44.522
Come on, man, what did you see?

01:03:44.612 --> 01:03:46.444
Josh, I need you to stop talking
until we find the car.

01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:48.067
Okay. You're sure the car's over here?

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:49.694
Yes, I'm positive the car's over here.

01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:52.401
Can we please talk about what we got on tape?

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:53.611
Oh yes!

01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:55.367
- I told you.
- The car!

01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:57.073
Oh, oh!

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:03.496
Thank God.

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:09.844
We're not gonna see anything, Josh.

01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:15.133
- Josh, get your ass in the car.
- Ah, come on, what if they come back?

01:04:15.226 --> 01:04:16.762
I swear to God I'll leave you. Let's go.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.890
- Just five minutes, man.
- Come on. Get in the car.

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:24.437
You really didn't see anything?

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.644
I thought I did. I thought I saw these, um...

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:30.231
- Like circles?
- No, dumbass. Like rings.

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:31.907
And they were above me,
and then they were gone.

01:04:31.993 --> 01:04:33.404
Wait, rings like the petroglyphs?

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.203
Did you guys not see these?

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:41.575
All right, it was obviously
in my head, all right? Let's just go.

01:04:46.257 --> 01:04:48.590
Oh shit. Oh shit.

01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:50.793
There we go.

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.173
Oh, thank God.

01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:57.141
You guys, what the hell just happened to us?

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:59.594
No one has ever filmed
anything like that before.

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:01.728
Let's just get out of here.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:05.857
Signs of civilization.

01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:09.483
I know. It feels so nice to listen to music.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.731
You're gonna be real famous, Josh.

01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:13.361
- I think he will be.
- Thank you.

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:15.238
Yeah, until they think it's all faked.

01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:25.293
- Are you okay, Mark?
- Yeah.

01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:28.546
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:30.625
Your head feels a little bit hot.

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:32.880
Yeah, I have a stomachache, but I'm good.

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:39.304
I think Mark's gonna be the most famous
when people see how bad he pissed his pants.

01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:41.431
Dude, shut up. Are you serious?

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:43.854
- Mark, you were really scared.
- I would have loved to see

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.808
- either of you up there by yourselves.
- You should have seen your face.

01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:48.233
Okay.

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:51.145
What's up with the radio?

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.321
- I have to drive for two hours.
- All right, all right, all right.

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:01.906
And we're done shooting.

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.248
Whoa, whoa, what is that?

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:08.545
- What?
- Is that a car?

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:10.998
- What is that?
- What the hell is that?

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:13.424
It's just a car.

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:14.968
No, no, no, there's no way on earth.

01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:17.091
Josh, cars don't have one light.
What is that?

01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:18.718
Is it getting clo... turn that off.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:20.094
Sorry.

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:22.268
- Okay, Mark, speed up. Go, go, go, go, go.
- I am.

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:24.390
Josh, is it getting closer?

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:26.063
Yeah, it's getting closer, I can see it.

01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:29.141
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell is that?

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:30.646
Josh, it's not a car! Josh, it's not a car!

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:32.353
Josh, what's it doing? What's it doing?

01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:34.609
- Is it getting closer?
- Oh, my God, it's right behind us!

01:06:35.283 --> 01:06:36.819
Mark, speed up! Go, go, go, go, go!

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:38.367
I'm going as fast as I can!

01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:42.988
- Don't stop, dude!
- My car just died!

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:45.244
- Oh, my God. I don't like this!
- What just happened?

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:47.042
What just happened? The car isn't going.

01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:48.960
The car isn't going.
What the hell just happened?

01:06:49.047 --> 01:06:50.083
Josh. Josh.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:51.755
- What the heck!
- Okay, stop.

01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:03.930
Uh, everything was fine with the car,
and now... it's not.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.511
The engine doesn't have power.

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:07.517
The whole car in general doesn't have power.

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:11.817
Ah.

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:14.312
My mouth tastes weird.

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:18.657
Adrenaline. It's why your mouth tastes weird.

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:23.115
No water.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.451
Yo, Josh, come help me.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:29.752
Cool.

01:07:30.838 --> 01:07:32.830
Ash, put the E-brake up.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:37.840
There we go. You ready? Let's go.

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:44.558
What the hell is going on, man?

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:46.010
I don't know, man.

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:48.604
All right, that's good, Ash.

01:07:55.613 --> 01:07:57.400
- Mark?
- Yeah?

01:07:58.408 --> 01:07:59.524
Hey, man, you all right?

01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:03.614
- Yeah.
- Dude. Dude, your nose is bleeding.

01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:04.741
What's going on?

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:09.041
- What happened?
- I just have a nose bleed.

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:11.335
- What?
- I'm fine.

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:12.457
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:14.539
I used to get 'em all the time
when I was a kid. Stop.

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:16.464
- Oh, my God.
- It is the dry air.

01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:18.212
- You're sweating.
- I'm fine.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:20.926
- Is it any better?
- Oh.

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:23.464
Here.

01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:27.009
How far do you think the gas station is?

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:30.600
- Mark?
- Uh, seven, eight miles.

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:32.393
In the dark?

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:35.438
We should stay with the car,
we're not doing that. That's crazy.

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.941
Yeah, we are. No, honest,
it'll take a couple hours,

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.442
it'll be open, we'll get some help.

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:41.944
- Let's go. Josh?
- Come on.

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:44.193
Ashley, this is crazy.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:49.661
Shoot.

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:56.167
- You all right?
- Huh?

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:58.006
You cool?

01:08:58.091 --> 01:08:59.252
- You all right?
- Hey, guys.

01:08:59.344 --> 01:09:00.505
- Yeah.
- Come on.

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.221
You guys, it's getting cold.

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:25.026
Hey, Ash?

01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:28.988
Hey, Ash? Let's let Mark catch up.

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:34.158
Something's wrong with him, Josh.

01:09:34.252 --> 01:09:37.212
- It's, uh, just a nose bleed.
- No.

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:38.960
It's not just a nose bleed.

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:43.549
I mean, something happened to him up there.

01:09:43.638 --> 01:09:46.676
It's not just a coincidence, the car dying
right when the lights came back.

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:52.515
So what are you saying?
They're messing with us?

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:57.315
They're following us.

01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:58.392
Guys!

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.022
Do you hear that?

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:08.698
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:10.908
Come here.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:13.457
Mark, come on.

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:17.044
No, someone's out there.

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:22.378
Hey!

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:25.176
- Mark!
- Come... come here! Come help us!

01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:26.720
Dude, come on!

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:30.432
Come help us!

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:32.510
- What is he talking about?
- Dan, I can hear you.

01:10:32.603 --> 01:10:33.468
- Mark!
- Mark!

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:34.599
Shh.

01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:38.474
Dan! Thank God!

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.730
- What? Do you hear anything?
- Guys, it's my brother!

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.231
How did you find us?

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:43.778
What the hell is he talking about?

01:10:43.865 --> 01:10:46.152
- Mark! Come on!
- Mark!

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:47.699
JOSH! Mark, come on!

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:51.741
Whoa! Jesus! Ashley!

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:52.912
Mark!

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:02.877
What was that?

01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:04.048
I don't know.

01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:12.515
Ow! Ah! Ah!

01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:39.289
- Mark!
- Mark! What the hell?

01:11:41.589 --> 01:11:42.830
Mark!

01:11:46.093 --> 01:11:48.927
Hey, Mark! I can't see his headlamp.

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:51.467
Mark?

01:11:54.185 --> 01:11:55.346
Come on, man.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.890
Hold on.

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:06.604
- Did you hear anything?
- No.

01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:08.108
'Cause Mark said he heard voices.

01:12:08.199 --> 01:12:09.986
What voices, Josh? There's no one out here.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:13.319
Let's just find Mark. Hey, Mark!

01:12:13.412 --> 01:12:15.199
He looked so sick. Mark?

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:16.746
How much further could he have gone?

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:18.995
- I don't... I don't know.
- Mark!

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.159
Mark!

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.667
Oh, God.

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:26.840
We're not going anywhere until we find Mark.

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:28.007
Mark!

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:29.710
- Ashley.
- No, we're gonna find him.

01:12:29.804 --> 01:12:30.965
Ashley.

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:32.796
Mark!

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:34.802
Mark!

01:12:34.892 --> 01:12:37.680
- He's gone.
- He's not gone.

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:40.012
He's not gone. He's just...

01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:43.975
he's just lost. He's just lost, okay?

01:12:44.068 --> 01:12:46.025
What are you talking about?

01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:47.853
He was there, and then he was gone.

01:12:47.947 --> 01:12:50.781
Something took him. They took him.

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:52.699
No. No one took him.

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:55.448
He's probably behind
one of these hills. Okay?

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:59.122
But we... we've gotta keep moving.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.746
We've gotta keep moving,
we've gotta find people.

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:04.249
We can come back and help Mark, all right?
So come on.

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:08.215
Come on. Please.

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:12.548
- Okay.
- All right, all right.

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:14.387
Okay.

01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:20.762
All right. I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:25.599
Listen...

01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:28.811
don't worry about him anyway.
Okay? He's been in...

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:32.990
the Boy Scouts
since he was like two years old.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:35.112
- Mark!
- And he's go...

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:37.702
Holy shit!

01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:40.576
- What? What is it?
- Look! Look, it's a light!

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.493
- Is it them?
- No!

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:47.421
That's like... like a street light
or a trailer or something.

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:50.673
I told you.

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:54.215
Okay. Let's go.

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:58.803
We can get some water. Call for help.

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:04.354
Let's go. Yeah.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:11.061
- Are you still filming?
- Yeah.

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:15.149
I'm trying to film landmarks
so we can retrace our steps.

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:16.983
That's smart.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:21.204
I think I just need a second to rest.

01:14:23.751 --> 01:14:25.083
We're gonna be okay.

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:26.876
We're gonna find him, Josh.

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:28.170
Yeah.

01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:39.472
- Shit!
- What?

01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:43.093
Damn it! I just dropped my flashlight.

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:44.849
Okay, where is it?

01:14:44.939 --> 01:14:46.805
No, there's no way we can get it. Look down.

01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:49.228
Shit!

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:51.731
Okay, we're gonna use this as a flashlight.

01:14:53.864 --> 01:14:55.605
Okay, just flash it
in front of me, all right.

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.236
- Okay.
- Don't drop it.

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:58.487
- All right.
- Okay, let's go.

01:14:58.577 --> 01:15:01.820
Whoa. How long does this battery last?

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:03.496
About an hour.

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:04.948
Oh, shit.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:08.039
Is it bright enough?

01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:10.579
Yeah, it's okay.

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:13.335
We're almost down.

01:15:15.469 --> 01:15:17.586
Josh?

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.887
What?

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.798
God. Oh, my God.

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:25.518
I have t... I have tissues.

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:27.937
Get 'em. Where's... where's...

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:29.811
- It's in my front pocket.
- The front pocket?

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:34.486
Here. Here. Here.

01:15:35.322 --> 01:15:36.483
Okay.

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:39.858
I shouldn't have brought you guys out here.

01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:44.784
It's not your fault. I wanted to come.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:46.452
Why?

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:48.912
I don't know.

01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:53.588
I just wanted to do something different.

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:56.049
Something unexpected.

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:01.968
Something my dad wouldn't expect, anyway.

01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:05.930
I'm good.

01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:07.644
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:10.188
I'm good. Come on.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:27.160
Shit. Ashley?

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:33.086
Shit.

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:39.426
Let's go.

01:16:40.221 --> 01:16:41.177
Okay.

01:16:46.727 --> 01:16:48.263
Oh, God.

01:16:50.731 --> 01:16:52.643
- Josh.
- Hey.

01:16:52.733 --> 01:16:54.065
Hey, we can't go back.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.107
Come on. Just don't look at 'em.

01:17:01.492 --> 01:17:02.983
- Shit.
- They're burned.

01:17:04.411 --> 01:17:05.697
They burned them.

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:19.257
Ah!

01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:24.428
Ashley?

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:28.133
Josh?

01:17:28.853 --> 01:17:31.641
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:32.720
It's okay.

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:43.318
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:47.318
Do you hear that?

01:17:54.753 --> 01:17:55.743
Ashley?

01:17:58.507 --> 01:17:59.497
Ashley?

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.296
You don't hear that?

01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:09.757
Ashley?

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:12.093
- It's my dad.
- Ashley?

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:13.224
Oh!

01:18:13.314 --> 01:18:15.522
- It's my dad!
- Oh, my... Oh, my God!

01:18:16.317 --> 01:18:18.525
- Ashley!
- Dad!

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:21.774
- Dad!
- Oh!

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:25.069
I'm right here!

01:18:25.159 --> 01:18:27.902
- Ashley, stop!
- Dad, I'm here!

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.575
I'm right here!

01:18:32.082 --> 01:18:34.745
- Dad, I'm here!
- Ashley, don't!

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:39.458
It's my dad! It's my dad!

01:18:40.674 --> 01:18:42.040
Dad!

01:18:45.638 --> 01:18:47.470
Ashley, stop!

01:18:48.515 --> 01:18:49.881
Dad!

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:05.609
