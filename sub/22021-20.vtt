WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.454
[Mike] Previously
on Designated Survivor...

00:02.586 --> 00:06.124
Your claim that Andrea Frost is
responsible for the hackings and murder...

00:06.256 --> 00:09.874
This conclusion is a product
of months of painstaking work.

00:10.010 --> 00:13.719
Dax, I asked you here because I think
you're an excellent judge of character.

00:13.847 --> 00:17.636
Dr. Andrea Frost.
Do you think she's capable of sabotage?

00:17.768 --> 00:21.136
You don't get to be
the first female tech billionaire

00:21.271 --> 00:23.137
without a ruthless streak.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.560
You're not just a saboteur, Dr. Frost,
you are a murderer.

00:25.692 --> 00:27.308
If you ever slander me in public again,

00:27.444 --> 00:31.153
this will be your last act working
for the government or anyone else.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.444
Your actions constitute rank
insubordination, which I cannot accept.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.614
-Mr. President--
-Agent Wells, you've been terminated.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.953
Effective immediately.

00:43.585 --> 00:47.670
Senator. Good to see you.
Thank you very much for coming. Hi.

00:47.798 --> 00:50.836
-[indistinct chatter]
-Remind me exactly what we're doing here.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.460
[Emily] The White House equinox reception
is a rite of passage, sir.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.965
[Lyor] We're celebrating renewal.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.135
[Tom] What exactly are we renewing?

00:58.267 --> 01:01.259
Our fiscal bonds.
The Beltway's biggest donors are here.

01:01.395 --> 01:05.263
People who will donate liberally
to your most cherished causes.

01:05.399 --> 01:09.233
-The Bultani ambassador's here.
-Thank you, Aaron. Excuse us.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.946
Mr. President.
The people of Bultan wish you a very--

01:14.074 --> 01:17.658
Mr. Ambassador, why don't we dispense
with the pleasantries and get to the point.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.824
Matthew Jennings needs to be released
from jail and allowed to come home now.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.285
The young man committed a crime.

01:23.417 --> 01:27.536
Yes, he has. He drew a smiley face
on the side of a building.

01:27.671 --> 01:31.335
Mr. Ambassador, he's a teenager
who is now facing ten years in prison?

01:31.925 --> 01:35.964
My country takes enforcement of its laws
very seriously.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.303
We both know this has nothing to do
with your laws

01:38.432 --> 01:40.514
and everything to do with the Pulu Islands.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.804
A territory our countries
share sovereignty over.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.519
Which means that the exploitation
of the oil reserves--

01:45.647 --> 01:48.856
Is subject to bilateral approval,
which we're not going to give.

01:49.526 --> 01:53.144
Now you're using an innocent teenager
as some kind of leverage.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.865
We're not gonna allow the desecration of
one of the last pristine places on Earth.

01:57.993 --> 02:01.861
Not desecration, Mr. President.
Exploration.

02:01.997 --> 02:05.740
And not innocent, but guilty,
as a Bultani court found.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.708
The trial lasted less than 15 minutes.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.579
Our justice system is very efficient,

02:11.715 --> 02:15.333
which is why sentence will be passed
as early as tomorrow.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.676
Gentlemen.

02:18.722 --> 02:19.803
[speaks Indonesian]

02:23.060 --> 02:25.677
[Kendra] Emily, meet Steven Flannery.
My first boss.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.348
-Pleasure.
-The pleasure is all mine.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.688
I'm a big fan of your work
at the Zeno Institute.

02:29.816 --> 02:33.434
Oh, thank you. We have great lawyers,
but not many Kendras out there.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.028
Or Steven Flannerys,
which is why we wanted to talk to you.

02:36.657 --> 02:37.522
I'm sorry?

02:37.658 --> 02:40.275
Cyrus Gladwell from the DC Circuit
passed away last week.

02:40.410 --> 02:44.028
And his death leaves the most important
appellate court in the land with an empty chair.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.450
The president needs someone

02:45.582 --> 02:49.917
whose brilliance and moral clarity
will lead the way. Someone like you.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.871
[stutters] I'm flattered.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.123
But I'm a teacher now, Kendra.
I'm an activist.

02:56.259 --> 03:00.253
"We must meet the challenge,
rather than wish it were not before us."”

03:01.515 --> 03:03.597
-Justice Brennan.
-Yes.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.387
You used to have that inscription
framed on your wall.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.386
- I still do.
-[Kendra chuckles]

03:08.522 --> 03:11.310
Judges don't just shape our laws.
They shape our values.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.274
| know you believe that
because you said it to me years ago.

03:14.861 --> 03:19.071
The president believes it, too.
He's asking you to meet the challenge.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.276
| may have been too good a mentor.
You're very persuasive.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.119
So that's a yes?

03:26.790 --> 03:28.155
[exhales deeply]

03:28.291 --> 03:30.783
If the president truly wants me to serve,
| will.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.295
[indistinct chatter]

03:35.924 --> 03:38.666
-Benjamin Harrelson. CEO of ClimateKind.
-Thank you.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.213
Benjamin, it's been too long.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.011
Mr. President, it's an honor.
| trust that the shrimp

03:43.140 --> 03:45.598
have been sustainably farmed this year,
unlike last?

03:45.726 --> 03:49.060
| have to be honest, I haven't checked,
but I'll get someone to look in on it.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.975
Try the hormone-free cheese puffs.
They're great.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.643
Enjoy your night.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.229
You throw a hell of a party
on the taxpayers' dime.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.025
Mr. West, I don't recall seeing you
on the guest list.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.865
I'm representing
the family of Matthew Jennings.

04:02.993 --> 04:03.949
Since when?

04:04.077 --> 04:07.115
Since I saw his poor mother
on the news last week. I was moved.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.454
-[scoffs] Moved right into the spotlight.
-[Tom] Lyor.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.620
I'm doing this out of concern
for an innocent kid.

04:11.752 --> 04:15.165
Please tell Ms. Jennings we're doing
all we can to bring her son home.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.755
Seems like
you're burning the midnight oil.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.886
[Dax] It's a little odd to have
the FBI pay me a visit, Agent Wells.

04:24.014 --> 04:28.850
Former FBI, actually.
The president just terminated me.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.886
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'd be happy to put you in touch

04:32.022 --> 04:34.059
with my head of security
to see if we're hiring.

04:34.191 --> 04:37.900
[chuckles softly] Oh, no,
I'm not... I'm not looking for a job.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.814
I'm looking to protect the president.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.355
The president who just fired you.

04:43.492 --> 04:48.703
Yes. Because I believe he's being misled
by a woman named Andrea Frost.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.741
| think you know the name.

04:50.874 --> 04:54.538
| do. Have you shared your suspicions
with your former boss?

04:55.170 --> 04:56.535
It's why I don't have a job.

04:56.671 --> 04:57.832
Hmm.

04:57.964 --> 05:01.423
The president has a blind spot
where his friends are concerned.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.134
An allegiance that sometimes cloud his judgment.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.182
Then what do you need from me?

05:07.724 --> 05:10.512
-Have lunch with her.
-Why?

05:10.644 --> 05:13.386
Her place is 43 minutes
from the Old Ebbitt Grill.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.940
Giving you time to break into her house
to search for evidence.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.058
[smacks lips]

05:19.194 --> 05:21.435
[chuckles softly] Yeah,
| can't be complicit with that.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.187
| thought you were loyal to the president.

05:23.323 --> 05:27.612
| am, but I'd rather not be
an accomplice to a burglary.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.611
There are other people
Dr. Frost will meet with.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.737
Why'd you come to me?

05:31.873 --> 05:35.491
Because they don't have
the president's best interests at heart.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.371
Mr. President.

05:40.507 --> 05:44.296
Mr. Ambassador, I'm not gonna talk about
the Pulu Islands any further this evening.

05:44.427 --> 05:48.261
There is no need, sir.
| appreciate the compromise.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.260
Excuse me?

05:50.392 --> 05:53.225
Agreeing on the offshore exploration
of the Pulu Islands

05:53.353 --> 05:57.563
allows our countries
to share in billions of revenue.

05:57.691 --> 06:01.730
| believe the prime minister is pleased.
And your Mr. Jennings will soon be home.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.524
Mr. Ambassador, who approached you
with this compromise?

06:05.115 --> 06:06.446
Your emissary.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.066
[door opens]

06:09.202 --> 06:11.239
Mr. West, you do know that
misrepresenting yourself

06:11.371 --> 06:13.578
as an agent of the US government
is a federal crime?

06:13.707 --> 06:14.572
| didn't do that.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.121
You're saying you didn't
promise the ambassador concessions

06:18.253 --> 06:20.164
for the release of Matthew Jennings?

06:20.297 --> 06:25.258
Absolutely not. I might have implied
that you would consider a deal.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.002
[chuckles softly]
Well, that's a crime, too.

06:28.138 --> 06:31.927
Not from where I sit.
Matthew Jennings is a scared 17-year-old kid--

06:32.058 --> 06:33.264
And you think I'm not aware of that.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.851
You might not be aware
our interests aren't exactly in line.

06:35.979 --> 06:39.188
-I'm sorry. I don't follow.
-You have all kinds of things to consider.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.809
Politics. Diplomacy. I have one. That kid.
| wanna get him home.

06:42.944 --> 06:46.778
And you can put me in jail if you want to.
| look good in orange.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.107
| just spoke with the president.

06:50.243 --> 06:54.202
He wants us to disabuse Ambassador Dhawan
of any notion of a quid pro quo.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.821
-Now.
-[exhales] There's gonna be fallout.

06:55.957 --> 06:59.200
Doesn't matter. Matthew Jennings' release
must be unconditional.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.828
-[groans]
-[guests gasp]

07:01.963 --> 07:03.954
-Oh, my God!
-Call 911! Now!

07:04.090 --> 07:05.672
[guests murmuring]

07:08.511 --> 07:10.969
-There's no pulse.
-Get me the president.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.088
[theme music playing]

07:24.110 --> 07:25.566
This is absurd.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.027
The ambassador has a heart attack
and dies in the White House

07:28.156 --> 07:30.238
and the Bultani prime minister
is blaming us?

07:30.367 --> 07:32.358
[Lyor] Yeah, they're using his death
for diplomatic advantage.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.826
-You think?
-[Mike] They could do that for a while.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.038
Preliminary indications are
Ambassador Dhawan was poisoned.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.329
-The ME is still examining the toxin.
-Are you serious?

07:41.461 --> 07:45.250
An unsolved murder of a Bultani diplomat on
US soil is not gonna help bilateral relations.

07:45.382 --> 07:48.545
Or Matthew Jennings.
His sentencing is today.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.669
[breathes deeply] If this is true,
it's on us to find the murderer, Mike.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.762
-Yes, sir.
-Emily--

07:53.890 --> 07:55.597
I'm in touch with Matthew Jennings's mother,
Kristin.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.012
Okay, good. I wanna talk to her.
Let's get to it.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.397
[Aaron] We're sitting
on a diplomatic powder keg.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.433
We need to keep this in-house, Mike.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.933
| spoke to DC Metro. They'll defer to us
unless we send up a flare.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.686
-[Mike] Understood.
-You're gonna need a running buddy on this.

08:08.822 --> 08:09.903
Someone from the FBI.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.863
I've got just the guy in mind.

08:13.660 --> 08:17.073
[speaks Indonesian]

08:17.664 --> 08:20.577
You just said, "I wish you lentils."

08:21.167 --> 08:25.161
Oh. I meant, "I wish you justice."

08:26.172 --> 08:28.550
We know that matters
to the Bultani people.

08:29.092 --> 08:33.051
It's what we want to get for your friend,
the late Ambassador Dhawan.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.717
There were no threats.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.136
At least, not at the embassy.

08:39.269 --> 08:42.260
-But Dhawan was hardly ever there.
-Where was he?

08:42.397 --> 08:45.014
At his horse farm in Potomac.

08:46.776 --> 08:51.111
The ambassador lived a lavish lifestyle,
unbecoming of a diplomat.

08:51.698 --> 08:52.654
How lavish?

08:52.782 --> 08:54.523
He liked money.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.280
And he had a talent for losing it.

09:02.292 --> 09:07.412
Matthew was in Bultan on a music exchange.
He plays the trumpet.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.914
Ms. Jennings, Matthew made a mistake.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.508
But what they're threatening him with
is unacceptable.

09:12.635 --> 09:15.343
Which is why we gotta get him
out of there as soon as we can.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.338
I've made a personal plea
to the prime minister.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.932
-What did he say?
-He said he would consider it.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.677
But unfortunately, right now, tensions are high
between our countries.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.099
In the meantime, sir, is there anything
we can offer them

09:25.231 --> 09:26.972
to grease the wheels
of Matthew' release?

09:27.108 --> 09:30.271
Negotiations for the return of US citizens
are classified.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.939
| can't elaborate on that any further.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.780
My son is my best friend.
He's all I've got.

09:34.908 --> 09:40.369
Ms. Jennings, I care more about
my children than anything in the world.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.205
| can only imagine
what you're going through.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.995
-But you're gonna have to trust me.
-[shudders]

09:46.127 --> 09:47.959
| promise you, I give you my word,

09:48.088 --> 09:51.797
we're gonna do absolutely everything we can
to bring your son home.

09:52.801 --> 09:53.632
[reporters clamoring]

09:53.760 --> 09:56.718
The president is committed
to bringing Matthew Jennings home.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.713
Is his release tied to the unsolved murder
of the Bultani ambassador?

09:59.849 --> 10:01.886
-No.
-Is it tied to the Pulu Islands?

10:02.018 --> 10:03.179
-No.
-I have it on authority

10:03.311 --> 10:06.724
from Ethan West that if the US
softens its stance on oil--

10:06.856 --> 10:09.723
Ethan West is no authority
and the president will not be held to ransom.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.725
May be too late for ransom.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.398
Bultan just sentenced the kid
to 20 years' hard labor.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.522
[reporters continue clamoring]

10:18.535 --> 10:20.867
[Tom] Twenty years' hard labor?
You can't be serious.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.655
I'm sorry you are disappointed
with the sentence.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.909
We were disappointed in the crime.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.331
But perhaps we can reach an accommodation.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.706
Mr. Prime Minister, I will not allow this nation
to be extorted.

10:33.842 --> 10:38.757
It's not about extortion.
It's about a mutual benefit.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.721
-[scoffs] A protected habitat--
-That could yield billions.

10:42.350 --> 10:47.095
That may not mean much to you,
but Bultan is drowning in debt.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.722
Matthew Jennings is not the solution
to your problems.

10:49.858 --> 10:50.848
No, sir.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.187
Oil is.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.732
| can help the young man.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.072
If you help me.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.407
The prison he is being sent to,

11:01.536 --> 11:04.324
I wouldn't wish him
to spend one day there.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.915
| would like to talk to him first,
see how he's being treated.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.000
I will arrange it.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.298
Sir, if we give in to blackmail,
we set a bad precedent.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.635
Respectfully, sir,
all to get one kid back?

11:19.762 --> 11:23.881
Matthew Jennings won't survive 20 days
in that prison, let alone 20 years.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.760
If there's something we can do
to help him, we're damn well gonna do it.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.979
[Chuck] Some spread.

11:32.108 --> 11:35.271
[Mike] The ambassador
clearly liked the good life.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.737
-That's a beautiful tree.
-[horses neighing]

11:39.866 --> 11:42.824
[Chuck] Not if you have allergies.
That thing must be a nightmare in the summer.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.363
Get it on the truck.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.867
Secret Service. What are you doing?

11:48.458 --> 11:50.665
Getting my money back.

11:50.793 --> 11:54.787
Ambassador Dhawan was in hock to me
for about two million,

11:54.923 --> 11:56.755
which he invested in horses.

11:56.883 --> 12:00.251
-How long you been trying to collect?
-About a year.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.343
He was trying to sell the farm,
but he couldn't.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.804
Surprising. It's a beautiful property.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.550
| wonder what the problem is.

12:08.603 --> 12:11.595
All I know is he's been in debt
for a couple years.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.846
Now if you don't mind,

12:12.982 --> 12:16.600
| have to go convince someone
this tub of glue is Secretariat.

12:21.532 --> 12:24.445
[Kendra] So where are we
on Flannery's vetting for the judgeship?

12:24.994 --> 12:27.577
Flannery's vetting file's as clean as a whistle.
Except for one blip.

12:27.705 --> 12:31.539
A 2008 sexual discrimination suit
filed by a female associate.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.705
Flannery and his then-firm
were the named defendants.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.373
But the case was dismissed with prejudice
at the discovery phase.

12:36.506 --> 12:39.624
-So what's the problem?
-The GOP, they control judiciary.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.717
And they will look for any excuse to disqualify
a progressive icon like Flannery.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.631
We need to get in front of this.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.678
Huh. The complainant is Kaitlin Corday.

12:49.686 --> 12:52.144
| worked with her at the Sentinel
a few years ago.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.309
Let me reach out,
see if she can give us the low-down.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.018
[indistinct chatter]

13:00.154 --> 13:02.145
Hi. The reservation is under Minter.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.073
[Hannah] How much time do we have?

13:06.202 --> 13:09.240
The restaurant's reservation system
indicates Minter's party has checked in.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.908
So, you've got two hours.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.623
Control box is on the side of the house.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.507
[computer beeps]

13:23.636 --> 13:26.754
I'm in. Good news is I bypassed a door
that won't trip the alarm.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.722
-Okay, what's the bad news?
-It's on the roof.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.817
[grunts]

14:02.175 --> 14:03.415
[EMF meter beeping]

14:08.097 --> 14:09.178
[beeping intensifies]

14:13.853 --> 14:16.436
Hey, Chuck, I'm getting an EMF spike.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.976
There's a lot of power
coming from this closet.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.940
It's gotta be a false wall.

14:28.409 --> 14:31.367
You're right. I'm going in.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.111
[Chuck] Watch yourself.

14:33.748 --> 14:34.738
Copy that.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.209
[Chuck] The EMF meter is off the charts.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.792
This place is drawing more power
than a small city.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.628
[EMF meter continues beeping]

14:53.226 --> 14:57.390
Chuck, I don't see any cameras.
I'm gonna link you in with my phone.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.230
This looks like mission control at NASA.

15:06.823 --> 15:07.813
Whoa.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.317
That's how the hacking's done.
Satellite telemetry.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.034
[Tom] How are they treating you, son?

15:21.170 --> 15:25.084
Fine, sir. I'm just sorry
I'm causing everyone so much trouble.

15:26.592 --> 15:27.673
[Tom] I know you are.

15:27.802 --> 15:31.716
You need to know we're doing absolutely
everything we can to bring you home.

15:31.848 --> 15:37.139
If you could just, uh, tell my mom
that I'm okay?

15:37.687 --> 15:41.476
Of course I will.
Hopefully you'll be seeing her really soon.

15:42.859 --> 15:47.023
I... I know they're blackmailing you,
and I don't want to be used that way.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.445
Promise me you won't let them--

15:50.366 --> 15:52.653
Matthew? Matthew!

15:53.286 --> 15:54.776
Son of a bitch.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.408
Get me Prime Minister Khallou immediately.

16:01.544 --> 16:04.912
Mr. President, the papers for the oil
exploration deal have been drawn up.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.879
Secretary Krantz is waiting
for your approval.

16:07.467 --> 16:11.586
Delay it. Emily, get Secretary Krantz
to draw up sanctions against Bultan.

16:11.721 --> 16:16.261
We're gonna raise the heat.
You were both right, and so is this kid.

16:16.392 --> 16:19.601
We'll find a way to bring him home
without rolling over.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.596
[Hannah] I think [ finally found
the access point to the main server.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.064
[Chuck] Just get in there, Hannah.
Time's wasting.

16:25.193 --> 16:27.059
Yeah, I'm working on it.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.107
[scanning and beeping]

16:30.239 --> 16:31.400
Okay, I'm in.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.949
On the double, please, because this is burglary.
Digital theft.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.363
Yeah, just watch my back.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.612
[speaks indistinctly]

16:38.748 --> 16:40.955
They just paid the check.
You have a half hour.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.460
You better get going.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.246
-[typing]
-[computer beeping]

16:44.378 --> 16:47.211
Wait, I got something.
It's on a sub-server.

16:49.217 --> 16:50.582
The Turing source code.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.129
Our hacking proof.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.968
[continues typing]

16:54.096 --> 16:56.554
I'm pulling up the relevant database,
but I can't copy it remotely.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.059
All right, I'm on it.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.144
It's nice to hear from you, Seth.
It's been a long time.

17:03.272 --> 17:06.981
Yep, since our days at the Sentinel.
And, uh, I'd love to catch up,

17:07.108 --> 17:09.601
but I'm afraid this is, um...
this is all business.

17:10.613 --> 17:13.776
We're considering Steven Flannery
for a position.

17:13.907 --> 17:16.319
| wanted to ask you about the claim
you filed against him.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.911
-It's all in the past.
-But the past informs the present.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.905
It was sexual discrimination?

17:22.959 --> 17:26.167
Yes. Failure to promote.
| was passed over.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.626
What was your relationship?

17:27.755 --> 17:31.749
He was partner. Asked me out
right before my review. I said no.

17:31.884 --> 17:32.999
And he retaliated.

17:33.135 --> 17:36.469
Well, not to my face, but he was
a big player at Whitney Irvington.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.508
The court said you couldn't state a claim.

17:38.641 --> 17:43.181
He shouldn't have hit on me.
He was a partner. I wanted to be one.

17:43.312 --> 17:47.180
| understand. I'm... I'm trying
to ascertain if he did anything else.

17:47.316 --> 17:50.775
No. He was perfectly lovely.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.940
Until the day I was shown the door.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.945
So you had no proof.

17:55.074 --> 17:59.193
No. And I wasn't going to get any
from the old boys' club.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.990
It's the reason I left the law
and became a journalist.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.536
Nobody keeps the real story
from me anymore.

18:05.668 --> 18:06.954
Why are we even talking about this?

18:07.086 --> 18:11.296
Kaitlin Corday's disgruntled because she was
passed over. There's nothing there.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.335
Except bad judgment on Flannery's part.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.960
Look, Flannery is the leading light
for women's rights, reproductive rights,

18:17.096 --> 18:18.712
-equal pay.
-And he's your rabbi.

18:18.848 --> 18:22.216
| wouldn't vouch for him
if I didn't believe in his virtue.

18:22.351 --> 18:25.389
No one's questioning his virtues.
We're talking about his vices.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.478
Asking a coworker out?

18:27.607 --> 18:31.396
Alright, look, Kendra's got a point.
Sounds like nothing but an indiscretion.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.189
Which shouldn't be reason enough
to torpedo him.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.734
Agreed. I will float a trial balloon
about his candidacy.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.231
Legal, media, political circles.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.859
Good. No red flags come back,
we'll bring him to the president.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.611
Great. Thank you.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.709
[computer beeping]

18:46.834 --> 18:49.542
Unless a meteor hits it,
the car's two minutes out.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.081
Come on, come on.

18:51.213 --> 18:55.172
-[scanning and beeping]
-We have enough. Get out of there.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.838
Do you know exactly
where the source code is on this database?

18:57.970 --> 18:59.881
-No.
-Then we're getting it all.

19:00.014 --> 19:03.973
Subject is in the driveway.
Hannah, get out.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.397
Got it. Go!

19:12.360 --> 19:14.192
Subject entering house.

19:28.209 --> 19:31.497
-Hey, Emily, do you have a second?
-Sure.

19:32.505 --> 19:36.089
Look, in the interest of full disclosure,

19:36.217 --> 19:41.178
| should let you know that Flannery and |
had a brief thing ten years ago.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.552
-How brief?
-It was one evening.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.142
We were on a case in Boise.
| was a junior associate.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.931
He was a newly-minted partner. We won big.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.897
Had a few French 75s
and he invited me back to his room.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.392
-Consensual?
-Absolutely.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.566
We never even discussed it.
And he's had my back ever since.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.481
And you kept a lid on this because...

20:01.617 --> 20:04.075
| didn't want to seem biased. I'm not.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.786
But in light of everything,
| don't wanna whitewash misconduct.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.073
It doesn't sound like
there's any misconduct to whitewash.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.952
No, he's... he's great. I don't know
if I should steer his candidacy.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.289
| disagree. You hooked the fish.
You reel him in.

20:18.551 --> 20:22.010
Emily, if I was...
if I was too defensive earlier--

20:22.138 --> 20:23.469
You weren't.

20:23.597 --> 20:26.555
You were being fair then
and you're being fair now.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.846
[Chuck] Pulled up Dhawan's financials.

20:32.982 --> 20:35.974
His farm's worth enough
to cover his debt, easy.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.186
Then why couldn't he sell it?

20:39.321 --> 20:42.188
He was in litigation with a company
called Royal Oak LLC.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.452
Seemed to involve his house.
I'm trying to get the filings.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.945
Good. And I just got
the full tox screen back from the ME.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.368
Dhawan was poisoned with ricin,
which takes six to eight hours to Kill.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.877
Meaning he wasn't poisoned here.

20:53.002 --> 20:57.963
Yep. We gotta find out where Dhawan was
before he keeled over.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.330
-DC Circuit?
-Yes.

20:59.467 --> 21:02.960
Assuming I'm confirmed, I'll need interns.
| think that you'd be perfect.

21:03.804 --> 21:04.635
Thanks.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.009
She's a comer, that one.

21:08.142 --> 21:12.557
Yeah. The vetting's coming along nicely.
Still a few T's to cross and I's to dot,

21:12.688 --> 21:14.395
but we'll get your name
to the president today.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.560
Great. It took some time
to get my head around it,

21:16.692 --> 21:18.729
but I think you're right. I could do
real good from the bench.

21:18.861 --> 21:21.068
You can. Stay close. I'll be in touch.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.188
Oh, Sasha, can you please show Mr. Flannery out?

21:23.324 --> 21:24.689
Hey. Steve Flannery.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.987
- Know. Sasha Dixon. It's an honor.
-Oh.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.359
Oh, thank you.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.499
[Steven continues speaking indistinctly]

21:31.624 --> 21:34.082
[Lyor] Hey. So, we all buttoned up?

21:34.210 --> 21:37.419
Just about. Um, I want to
double-check something, though.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.583
Could your people dig a little more
into Flannery for me?

21:39.715 --> 21:42.173
-They pulled everything on the record.
-This wouldn't be on the record.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.168
-What are you hoping to find?
-Nothing.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.136
Mm-hmm.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.852
You said you wanted to talk to me
about ClimateKind?

21:54.980 --> 21:58.018
Yeah. But first
we need to show you something.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.140
[typing]

22:00.486 --> 22:03.228
[Chuck] We retraced the ambassador's steps
over the last 24 hours.

22:05.074 --> 22:08.032
That's Ambassador Dhawan yesterday,
at a cafe.

22:08.160 --> 22:12.074
And that's you, swapping out his drink
and poisoning him.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.953
[chuckles softly] Are you mad?
That's not me.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.371
Looks like your ring.

22:17.503 --> 22:20.791
It's an Eastlake University ring.
A lot of people have the same one.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.631
Yes, but not people
involved in protracted litigation

22:23.759 --> 22:26.421
over the removal of a giant oak tree
that straddles the property line

22:26.554 --> 22:28.795
between your house and the ambassador's.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.217
What are you talking about?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.716
The tree's root system destroyed
the ambassador's plumbing.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.935
-It's why he couldn't sell the house.
-Unless he got the tree removed.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.981
Your loan-out, Royal Oak LLC,
got injunctions.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.817
Until Dhawan finally got a court order
to take the tree down.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.606
And with Bultan in the news,

22:44.738 --> 22:47.696
you figured now was the time
to kill the ambassador. Right?

22:48.075 --> 22:49.577
Because there'd be multiple suspects.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.818
But in the end, there was only one.

22:51.954 --> 22:55.788
Your tree. Your ring. Your drink.

22:56.417 --> 22:57.452
Your ass.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.371
Thank you, Julie.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.171
Where are we at with the kid?

23:07.303 --> 23:11.342
Solving the murder of the ambassador Dhawan
relieved pressure on the prime minister.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.805
-He's in a place to negotiate.
-Okay, good.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.596
Except his office just released a statement
saying he won't.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.686
| thought we floated
a six-month jail sentence

23:18.814 --> 23:21.021
in exchange for limited drilling rights.
That's a nonstarter?

23:21.150 --> 23:25.189
It is, because Ethan West is on a rampage.
CNN, MSNBC, Al Jazeera.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.527
What is he saying?

23:26.655 --> 23:30.193
He's saying
that the prime minister is Stalin.

23:30.326 --> 23:33.114
That, uh, you're in bed with the devil.
That both countries are corrupt.

23:33.245 --> 23:37.204
Get the son of a bitch in here. I need
to talk to him. Arrest him if you have to!

23:40.169 --> 23:41.159
Unbelievable.

23:48.677 --> 23:52.511
[Tom] Mr. West, there's a difference
between an adversary and an enemy.

23:52.640 --> 23:57.350
When you sabotaged my negotiation,
you crossed the line.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.519
I'm just doing what's best for Matthew.

24:00.689 --> 24:04.102
Well, thanks to you and your overreach,

24:04.860 --> 24:07.022
he is now looking at 20 years.

24:09.198 --> 24:12.862
| couldn't figure out why you became involved
in this case in the first place,

24:12.993 --> 24:16.111
so I had my people look into it.
They brought me this file.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.156
Why didn't you tell me you knew his aunt?

24:20.292 --> 24:23.660
You went to college with Allie Jennings.
Is that correct?

24:26.215 --> 24:27.046
Yes.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.876
And she was murdered in 1988.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.386
Yes.

24:34.515 --> 24:36.722
What does that have to do with you?

24:39.520 --> 24:40.510
Everything.

24:42.648 --> 24:45.811
| was supposed to meet Allie that night
for a drink.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.401
But I...

24:51.156 --> 24:52.408
| got sidetracked.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.486
And I stood her up.

24:56.829 --> 25:00.072
The file said she was found stabbed to death
outside a bar.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.702
At two in the morning.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.251
Waiting for me.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.545
Her sister didn't... didn't know
about the connection.

25:11.677 --> 25:14.510
[stutters] But I heard about the case
and I reached out.

25:16.598 --> 25:19.386
So this is your effort
to make some kind of amends?

25:19.518 --> 25:21.885
What happened to Kristin Jennings is my fault.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.436
No, it isn't.

25:24.565 --> 25:27.808
Yeah, it is.
And it's why I wanna get her son back.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.480
Not in a year. Not in six months.
Not in a week. Today.

25:30.612 --> 25:35.448
Mr. West, all you're doing right now
is getting in the way.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.950
You wanna help the Jennings
and the young man?

25:40.372 --> 25:42.363
You need to work with me.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.490
Another complaint?

25:44.626 --> 25:46.913
Yes, one. For retaliatory dismissal.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.083
It was settled out
with a confidentiality agreement.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.000
But it can still come to light, right?

25:51.133 --> 25:54.967
Unlikely. This is subterranean. It's core of
the earth stuff. Judiciary will not trip to it.

25:55.095 --> 25:59.760
-Who was the complainant?
-26-year-old paralegal named Jane Quincy.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.429
But two lawsuits in decades of practice
isn't disqualifying.

26:02.561 --> 26:06.429
You work in the legal profession, the people
you rub shoulders with tend to be litigious.

26:06.982 --> 26:09.940
He'll sail through confirmation.
But it's your call.

26:10.986 --> 26:11.976
I'll tell him.

26:30.172 --> 26:31.333
[Kendra] Thanks.

26:39.973 --> 26:42.305
-Hey.
-Hey. Kendra.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.306
I'm so sorry I couldn't get back
to the White House.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.475
-It's been a crazy day.
-No problem.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.472
-Please.
-Thanks.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.892
So, I've been looking
at the DC Circuit's docket

26:53.028 --> 26:56.020
for the upcoming calendar.
You're right, so many crucial cases.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.658
[server] And your drinks.

26:57.783 --> 27:02.198
Oh, thank you. I got you a French 75.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.700
| haven't had one of these since--

27:05.833 --> 27:10.043
Boise, right? I thought
this was a night for celebration.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.752
[angrily] Mr. President,
I will keep this short.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.003
Mr. West has humiliated me.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.553
Made me look like I'm colluding
with a country that kills our ambassadors.

27:24.685 --> 27:26.847
Well, he hasn't done me many favors, either.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.516
Sir, I need you to know
| had nothing to do with that.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.561
It doesn't matter,
because now we have a new deal.

27:32.693 --> 27:36.857
Bultan gets unrestricted
exploration rights on the Pulu Islands.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.777
No profit-sharing. And no sanctions.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.569
If I don't agree with that?

27:41.702 --> 27:44.535
Matthew Jennings does 20 years.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.704
| was afraid you were gonna say that.

27:47.833 --> 27:51.371
| believe Mr. West
has a different perspective on the issue.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.457
Hi, Mr. Prime Minister.

27:54.590 --> 27:57.924
[Tom] He has discovered something unusual
in the Pulu Island habitat.

27:58.552 --> 28:02.295
You destroyed it.
Strip-mining, dumping, air pollution.

28:02.431 --> 28:06.550
Mr. West also happens to be one of the world's
most renowned toxic tort lawyers.

28:06.685 --> 28:10.269
He plans to file suit against your country
in every international tribunal.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.263
I'll make it my mission
to sue your country.

28:13.442 --> 28:16.605
[Tom] I think we're both aware of
what Mr. West is capable of.

28:17.196 --> 28:21.815
This mission of his is going to cost your
country billions and billions of dollars.

28:21.950 --> 28:25.864
Don't just take his word for it.
Google me. Look at my verdicts.

28:26.455 --> 28:29.618
Sir, I think you have an opportunity here
to show the rest of world

28:29.750 --> 28:31.912
the depth of your compassion, your humanity.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.671
What do you want, Mr. President?

28:37.799 --> 28:39.255
Mr. Jennings' freedom.

28:40.636 --> 28:41.922
And the mining?

28:42.054 --> 28:44.011
[Tom] I'm afraid that's been
taken off the table.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.676
The US government will be more than happy

28:46.808 --> 28:49.140
to pay for the damage
caused by the graffiti.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.805
And in order for you to save face,

28:50.938 --> 28:55.102
Mr. Jennings will wash the graffiti
off the wall himself in front of cameras.

28:55.984 --> 28:58.942
Now, if there's nothing else to discuss,
| believe our business is done.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.229
Mr. President--

29:01.365 --> 29:04.278
The FAA will contact you
as soon as his flight is in the air,

29:04.409 --> 29:06.116
then you can call his mother.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.862
Mr. President, I can't thank you enough
for helping me make this right.

29:08.997 --> 29:12.160
Everyone deserves
a second chance, Mr. West.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.039
[Emily] How you doing?

29:20.175 --> 29:24.009
Good. Then bad. Then good again.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.925
| had to pull the offer, Em.

29:29.977 --> 29:31.138
Did you give him a reason?

29:32.354 --> 29:36.063
| said the GOP was playing hardball.

29:36.191 --> 29:40.105
We didn't have the votes.
He was disappointed.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.315
It was your call.

29:42.447 --> 29:45.189
Yeah, and I'm not sure
it was the right one.

29:46.201 --> 29:49.364
These two cases are ambiguous.

29:50.372 --> 29:53.205
But I... I saw Steven Flannery today.

29:54.209 --> 29:56.826
On the make, as usual. And I just...

29:57.838 --> 30:02.878
It made me wonder if, that time in Boise,
| was coerced.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.341
Were you?

30:04.469 --> 30:06.335
At the time, I didn't think so.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.839
Now, I'm not so sure.

30:11.476 --> 30:14.434
His approval meant so much to me.

30:14.563 --> 30:17.055
[chuckles] It still does.

30:18.734 --> 30:23.069
And I think he knows that.
And... and he uses it.

30:23.196 --> 30:27.906
And that is manipulative and wrong.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.863
But he's also done so much good, you know?

30:35.417 --> 30:37.124
You're wondering if that cancels out--

30:37.252 --> 30:40.244
My suspicions of a guy
who may be nothing but a flirt.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.914
Sometimes all you have is your gut.

30:47.262 --> 30:48.593
Good night, Kendra.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.061
Mr. President.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.682
Thank you, Mike.

31:01.276 --> 31:04.439
Dax. Thank you for coming.
Have a seat.

31:05.030 --> 31:05.940
[Dax] Of course.

31:07.532 --> 31:11.526
Did you speak to Agent Hannah Wells
about Dr. Frost?

31:12.537 --> 31:15.529
Yes. I... She asked for my help.

31:16.583 --> 31:20.952
She's a tenacious investigator,
and insists that Dr. Frost was responsible

31:21.088 --> 31:24.297
for the cyberattacks
that have crippled my administration.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.415
| know. She told me.

31:27.969 --> 31:28.959
She's wrong.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.092
During my 25th Amendment hearing,

31:33.225 --> 31:36.013
Dr. Frost was questioned
about a conversation,

31:36.144 --> 31:39.353
a private conversation,
that we had in this office.

31:39.481 --> 31:43.315
Agent Wells thought she leaked
that conversation to Ethan West

31:43.443 --> 31:44.649
in an effort to undermine me

31:44.778 --> 31:46.485
because that's what
the hacker would've done.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.446
You never know what people are capable of.

31:49.574 --> 31:54.614
Exactly. So I had the Secret Service
sweep my office for bugs.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.282
And they found one thing.

31:57.290 --> 32:01.500
[Dax] Zero to 60 in three flat.
Carbon neutral, 400 miles to a charge.

32:01.628 --> 32:04.120
Rolling off the assembly lines
this spring.

32:07.467 --> 32:08.457
This.

32:10.137 --> 32:11.753
Inside the car you gave me.

32:12.848 --> 32:14.464
Needless to say, I was speechless.

32:14.599 --> 32:18.467
Because I couldn't believe that a man,
one of my closest friends,

32:18.603 --> 32:21.140
could possibly have hacked
the power grid, NASA.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.058
Tom--

32:22.190 --> 32:25.148
Released a video of me confronting the man
who killed my wife!

32:28.947 --> 32:31.939
Speechless doesn't even come close
to covering this.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.866
Why the hell would you do this to me?

32:36.204 --> 32:37.194
[scoffs]

32:42.669 --> 32:45.536
You know the greatest curse
facing this country right now?

32:46.715 --> 32:49.924
Government interference. Overregulation.

32:50.051 --> 32:52.338
What the hell are you talking about?

32:52.471 --> 32:54.929
Free enterprise? The promise of America?

32:55.056 --> 32:58.265
A promise that's been strangled
by red tape.

32:58.393 --> 33:01.931
A bureaucracy that prevents innovation,
stifles human progress.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.441
So you attack our institutions.
Undermine them.

33:04.566 --> 33:08.230
In hopes while the country's distracted,
you'd build your empire without scrutiny?

33:08.361 --> 33:11.649
You make it sound like I'm some kind of
Bond villain. I'm not.

33:12.407 --> 33:13.818
Then what the hell are you?

33:15.160 --> 33:19.575
Do you know the good my companies can do
if they are left to flourish?

33:19.706 --> 33:22.789
Without anti-trust investigations?

33:22.918 --> 33:26.912
And I'm not talking about money.
I'm talking about freedom.

33:27.923 --> 33:32.258
The greatest right we have as Americans
is the right to be left alone.

33:35.680 --> 33:39.969
Trust me. I'm gonna do everything I can
to make sure you're left alone.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.091
[intercom clicks]

33:47.609 --> 33:51.443
Agent Wells. So you're back
in the president's good graces.

33:52.072 --> 33:56.657
| was never out. I broke into your house
while you were at lunch with Frost.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.367
You staged her firing?

33:58.954 --> 34:02.288
Yes. Because I knew you'd be listening.

34:03.291 --> 34:07.455
And I knew when she talked to you
about Dr. Andrea Frost, you'd take the bait.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.454
Because just like every other coward...

34:12.717 --> 34:15.300
you need someone
to blame everything else on.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.927
Get him out of my sight.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.083
You did okay out there today, rook.

34:49.963 --> 34:52.204
Thanks. I'm better in here, though.

34:52.340 --> 34:57.130
Yeah. And you're definitely better off
not working for someone who got fired.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.297
Because if Hannah was really gone,
you'd be, too.

35:02.976 --> 35:05.638
-How long did you know?
-From the jump.

35:06.813 --> 35:07.564
I'm Secret Service.

35:07.689 --> 35:10.681
There's nothing that goes on
in this building that I don't know about.

35:12.652 --> 35:13.642
I'll remember that.

35:14.195 --> 35:18.063
Remember this, too.
| got a lot of respect for Hannah.

35:18.199 --> 35:21.362
And I think it's great
that you look out for her.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.361
But you gotta
look out for yourself as well.

35:37.344 --> 35:38.550
-Hey.
-[Andrea] Hey.

35:40.055 --> 35:42.217
Congratulations.
Looks like you pulled this off.

35:42.849 --> 35:48.435
Yes, we did. Dax Minter has been arrested
and is being charged as we speak,

35:48.563 --> 35:50.395
thanks in large part to you.

35:51.024 --> 35:54.517
Are you all right?
| know he was your best friend.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.606
[chuckles softly]

35:56.738 --> 35:58.524
Alex was my best friend.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.065
But he and I were close.

36:01.201 --> 36:04.068
And for a long time,
he was one of those rare people

36:04.204 --> 36:06.445
you didn't have to explain anything to.

36:06.581 --> 36:09.494
Or pull out all the old stories for,
because he was there.

36:10.919 --> 36:12.125
Tom, I'm so sorry.

36:12.253 --> 36:15.416
Yeah. Me, too.

36:16.883 --> 36:20.421
I'm just gonna have to accept
that he's not the same person now.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.087
Not the one who was my friend.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.095
| just wish I knew what had turned him.

36:28.103 --> 36:33.018
Anyway, I would never have gotten through
these last few months

36:33.775 --> 36:36.483
without your incredible friendship
and support.

36:36.611 --> 36:40.445
Thank you. And I'm sorry
that you got pulled into all of this.

36:40.573 --> 36:41.950
I'm not.

36:43.368 --> 36:46.201
| made a friend. A good one.

36:51.084 --> 36:53.951
One that I'm going to miss. Tom, um...

36:55.755 --> 36:57.621
[clears throat]
I'm moving to San Francisco.

36:58.258 --> 36:59.840
San Francisco? Why?

36:59.968 --> 37:02.585
Apache's acquiring
another aerospace company

37:02.721 --> 37:05.964
and it's a big play for us.
| need to be there for the transition.

37:07.142 --> 37:09.099
And close to the Cabernet.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.638
[both chuckle]

37:10.770 --> 37:12.636
Makes sense on both counts.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.108
Tom, listen,
| wanna say something because [sighs]...

37:20.572 --> 37:23.564
| think we share a connection.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.370
You lost your wife, I lost my husband.

37:30.498 --> 37:35.618
And they will always
hold a place in our hearts.

37:35.754 --> 37:36.710
Yes, they will,

37:36.838 --> 37:40.832
[stutters] But I think
part of getting through this...

37:43.636 --> 37:46.628
is making room in your heart
for someone else.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.302
And I wish that for you someday.

37:52.187 --> 37:54.428
| wish that for you, too.

37:56.357 --> 37:57.188
Bye, Tom.

37:58.359 --> 38:00.646
| prefer "Till I see you again.”

38:02.864 --> 38:04.070
Till I see you again.

38:04.199 --> 38:07.112
Yeah. Come here.

38:08.369 --> 38:09.985
You go get 'em out there, Andrea.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.477
[door opens]

38:40.068 --> 38:41.058
Hey.

38:42.237 --> 38:43.853
| found something on Minter's drive.

38:44.572 --> 38:47.189
A large payment
right after Damian was killed

38:47.325 --> 38:50.192
to a company
called Smith & Johnson Holdings.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.786
The killer-for-hire didn't even try
to make it sound legit.

38:52.914 --> 38:54.279
Is there a name?

38:54.415 --> 38:58.249
No. Just a business address.
2500 D Street Northwest. It's in DC.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.915
- I know that address.
-Who's it belong to?

39:01.047 --> 39:05.712
No one. That's the point.
It's an old, empty office building.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.211
Dummy corps pay to register
their business addresses there

39:08.346 --> 39:09.711
so they can stay off the grid.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.260
If there's a payment,
there's gotta be a money trail.

39:12.392 --> 39:16.477
The person who made the payment
would wanna cover their tracks.

39:16.604 --> 39:19.312
So they went there and paid
building management in cash.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.305
That's my guess.

39:20.441 --> 39:22.057
-Can you get into their security system?
-[typing]

39:22.193 --> 39:23.308
-Already on it.
-Good.

39:23.444 --> 39:26.061
Look for the, um... the day
the company was registered.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.653
That's when
the payment would've been made.

39:27.782 --> 39:28.863
Got it.

39:30.618 --> 39:31.870
Wait. Stop it there.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.245
Valeria Poriskova®?

39:36.374 --> 39:41.084
Wait. How the hell did Dax Minter
link up with Valeria?

39:42.547 --> 39:45.414
Minter knew
that I was on the hacking investigation.

39:45.550 --> 39:49.464
So to close the loop, he tried to get rid
of me and make it look like Frost did it.

39:49.596 --> 39:53.089
Who better to hire than a Russian agent
you've been clashing with

39:53.224 --> 39:55.010
who wants you dead anyway?

39:55.143 --> 39:59.478
Except Valeria missed me
and killed Damian.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.446
[lounge music playing through speakers]

40:24.255 --> 40:25.245
[Aaron sighs]

40:27.342 --> 40:29.959
What you're looking for isn't in there.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.550
| think you know where you can take
your self-help advice.

40:34.682 --> 40:35.672
[chuckles]

40:38.102 --> 40:39.092
[sighs]

40:41.689 --> 40:44.181
Hannah, I can't let you hunt down Valeria.

40:45.985 --> 40:49.194
Dax Minter is behind bars.
The hacking is done.

40:50.865 --> 40:53.027
We're repairing relations with Russia.
It's over.

40:53.660 --> 40:54.991
Not for me, it isn't.

40:57.956 --> 41:00.493
There are things that I have to do, Aaron.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.950
That I cannot do
working for the White House.

41:19.519 --> 41:21.351
| mean, think, Hannah.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.561
You lay those down,
you may not get 'em back.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.075
Bye, Aaron.
