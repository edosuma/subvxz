WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:01.664
Previously on "Royal Pains"...

00:01.827 --> 00:03.311
Can we get a little help over here?

00:03.336 --> 00:04.577
Jen and Sam!

00:04.602 --> 00:07.561
Sam seems like such a great, happy kid,

00:07.562 --> 00:10.432
I don't want to cause collateral damage.

00:10.442 --> 00:11.552
I don't wanna be my dad.

00:11.562 --> 00:13.442
Sam's actually leaving next week

00:13.467 --> 00:15.352
to spend the summer in
Idaho with his dad.

00:15.392 --> 00:18.351
- Hi. Diana Underhill.
- Hank Lawson. Nice to meet you.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.422
I can't let anyone see me
dealing with a medical problem.

00:20.432 --> 00:21.542
Diana, I'm sorry to tell you,

00:21.552 --> 00:23.542
you may have to consider a hysterectomy.

00:23.552 --> 00:25.471
Can I get it all done at once?

00:25.472 --> 00:27.511
You mean do the
hysterectomy on the spot?

00:27.512 --> 00:29.352
I think I just wanna get it over with

00:29.362 --> 00:31.372
and get back to work.

00:31.382 --> 00:32.551
I have a Senate seat to win.

00:32.552 --> 00:34.472
Excuse me, we're looking for Dr. Sacani.

00:34.482 --> 00:36.352
Are we in the right place?

00:36.362 --> 00:38.472
Jeremiah, those patients over
there are waiting for you.

00:38.482 --> 00:40.481
Those aren't patients.
Those are my parents.

00:40.482 --> 00:42.472
I don't know why they're here,
but I'll ask them to leave.

00:42.482 --> 00:44.552
Hospital server's down.
No one's getting emails.

00:44.562 --> 00:46.422
I think this tech glitch

00:46.432 --> 00:47.512
is getting worse.

00:47.522 --> 00:50.361
You know that glitch? It's
not a technical problem.

00:50.362 --> 00:51.441
So then what's the issue?

00:51.442 --> 00:53.432
We've been hacked.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.813 --> 01:07.803
Thank you all for convening so quickly.

01:07.813 --> 01:09.003
All right, as department heads,

01:09.013 --> 01:10.893
I just wanna make sure
you're fully informed

01:10.903 --> 01:12.873
about this recent data hack,
and here with an update

01:12.883 --> 01:16.115
is our head of IT, Lewis Nardhoffer.
Lewis?

01:16.178 --> 01:17.497
Right, uh...

01:17.522 --> 01:19.442
so we don't know who did it,

01:19.600 --> 01:20.679
but we're trying to figure it out

01:20.680 --> 01:24.580
using a single packet
IP traceback, only...

01:24.590 --> 01:25.600
see, the router storage intervals

01:25.610 --> 01:26.719
are, like, crazy short,

01:26.720 --> 01:28.719
so cross your fingers
that whoever it was

01:28.720 --> 01:30.590
wasn't configured to forward

01:30.600 --> 01:33.550
their DNS queries though a proxy.

01:35.560 --> 01:36.620
Of course, that's unlikely,

01:36.630 --> 01:38.679
and their source fields are
probably spoofed anyway.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.719
Right. Got that? Cross your fingers.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.660
- Thank you, Lewis.
- Yeah, no problem.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.670
I should have more for you
by the end of the day.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.640
Okay, great. Now...

01:46.650 --> 01:49.500
until we know enough to address
the situation properly,

01:49.510 --> 01:51.519
I don't want anyone discussing it, okay?

01:51.520 --> 01:54.670
With anyone. No one, and that means...

01:54.680 --> 01:57.599
everyone. Okay? Am I clear?

01:57.600 --> 01:58.639
I think not.

01:58.640 --> 02:01.570
Boris! Uh, hello. I
wasn't expecting you.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.609
Yes.

02:02.610 --> 02:03.720
You appear to have a knack

02:04.490 --> 02:06.570
for not expecting things, Mr. Lawson.

02:06.580 --> 02:08.609
I want a letter drafted immediately

02:08.610 --> 02:10.610
alerting anyone who may have
been affected by this...

02:10.620 --> 02:14.520
our employees, vendors,
patients, etcetera.

02:14.530 --> 02:16.630
Their personal information
has been compromised,

02:16.640 --> 02:19.550
and it is essential that they know that.

02:19.560 --> 02:22.560
The thing is, Boris, we don't know that.

02:22.570 --> 02:24.600
Do we?

02:24.610 --> 02:26.690
That is a syslog FTP analysis question.

02:28.580 --> 02:31.490
Evan, the situation is
dire enough as it is.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.649
Wouldn't you agree?

02:32.650 --> 02:34.520
Concealing it or...

02:34.530 --> 02:36.530
even the appearance of concealing it

02:36.540 --> 02:40.529
can only aggravate it and me further.

02:40.530 --> 02:41.659
Am I clear?

02:41.660 --> 02:43.600
Crystal.

02:48.540 --> 02:51.640
Come on, Rosie, come on.
Get the Frisbee.

02:53.610 --> 02:56.520
So is the coffee okay?

02:56.530 --> 02:58.619
Uh, yes. Absolutely okay.

02:58.620 --> 03:01.520
Oh, there's Divya.

03:01.530 --> 03:04.490
So off we go, and off you go.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.600
Safe travels. Good morning!

03:06.610 --> 03:08.690
Good morning. Can I offer
you some breakfast?

03:08.700 --> 03:10.700
Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

03:10.710 --> 03:14.619
Uh... did you two stay
out here last night?

03:14.620 --> 03:16.660
Sure did. Rosie loves the beach

03:16.670 --> 03:18.560
and with a sweet ride like Bess here,

03:18.570 --> 03:19.640
why bunk in with Jerry?

03:19.650 --> 03:21.659
- Yeah, they call the RV Bess.
- And you Jerry.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.700
Are you sure I can't get
you something to eat?

03:23.710 --> 03:25.660
You look like you're
eating for at least two.

03:25.670 --> 03:28.660
You are kind, but, uh, no.

03:28.670 --> 03:30.669
Jeremiah and I, we've got to get going.

03:30.670 --> 03:31.670
Same with us.

03:31.680 --> 03:33.570
Niagara Falls isn't gonna see itself.

03:33.580 --> 03:36.509
- So soon?
- Divya, we ride to live

03:36.510 --> 03:37.540
and live to ride.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.670
But you just got here last night.

03:38.680 --> 03:42.610
And there is a HankMed barbecue tonight.

03:42.620 --> 03:43.709
I got extra buns.

03:43.710 --> 03:45.700
You know, if they're unopened,
you can return them.

03:45.710 --> 03:47.570
Don't be silly. You're his parents.

03:47.580 --> 03:49.709
You have to stay. Don't they, Jerry?

03:49.710 --> 03:52.509
"They have to" seems
a little imperative.

03:52.510 --> 03:53.700
But...

03:53.710 --> 03:56.620
I guess we could stay another night.

03:56.630 --> 03:58.700
Good! Good. Then we'll
see you at the party.

03:58.710 --> 04:00.630
Great. I'll bring a cheese ball.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.690
- I'll bring her.
- Ha ha ha!

04:04.630 --> 04:06.559
All right, bye.

04:06.560 --> 04:07.630
Bye-bye.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.620
Come on, Rosie. Get the Frisbee.

04:10.630 --> 04:11.679
Rose!

04:16.680 --> 04:18.560
But I want to go.

04:18.570 --> 04:20.709
Because the HankMed cookout
sounds so fun to you?

04:20.720 --> 04:22.560
No, because pie.

04:22.570 --> 04:24.560
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to cause a problem,

04:24.570 --> 04:26.719
but it's totally casual, and you
guys are more than welcome.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.639
Please, Mom?

04:28.640 --> 04:30.710
Okay. Because pie.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.560
Great. Nice running into you,

04:32.570 --> 04:33.680
and I'll see you later.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.590
Pro tip... show up early if
you want more than one slice.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.580
- Can we go with Hank?
- No, he has to go to work.

04:38.590 --> 04:40.519
- You have to go to camp.
- Hey, you wanna trade?

04:40.520 --> 04:41.679
I'll go canoeing and you
can make house calls?

04:41.680 --> 04:43.679
- Nah.
- Smart move.

04:43.680 --> 04:46.630
Today looks like it's
gonna be pretty boring.

04:52.530 --> 04:53.710
Aah!

05:00.610 --> 05:02.590
Drop to the ground and
roll to put out the...

05:04.540 --> 05:06.520
Or... yeah... that.

05:06.530 --> 05:08.600
Okay. You're not on fire anymore.

05:08.610 --> 05:10.720
Oh... I hope they got the shot.

05:11.490 --> 05:12.569
That looked real, right?

05:12.570 --> 05:13.640
Yeah, I'd say a little too real.

05:13.650 --> 05:14.640
Are you... are you okay?

05:14.650 --> 05:16.560
Yeah. Mostly.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.016
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:31.697 --> 05:33.847
I'm a doctor. Your finger's dislocated.

05:33.857 --> 05:36.847
What I need to do is... that.

05:36.857 --> 05:39.735
- It happens all the time.
- Pain amuses her.

05:39.775 --> 05:41.775
Should have seen the
face-plant she took last week.

05:41.785 --> 05:43.695
Life of a stuntwoman.

05:43.705 --> 05:45.695
- You're making a movie?
- Yeah, we're trying.

05:45.705 --> 05:46.814
Uh, sorry to freak you out.

05:46.815 --> 05:48.805
I'm Rachel Kepler. This
is my brother Doug

05:48.815 --> 05:50.645
and our friend Scott.

05:50.655 --> 05:52.655
- Hey.
- You're filming on a phone?

05:52.665 --> 05:54.615
On a phone with an anamorphic lens,

05:54.625 --> 05:56.614
a Steadicam and Filmic Pro, yeah.

05:56.615 --> 05:58.735
Please don't ask him any more
about lenses, I beg you.

05:58.745 --> 06:00.694
So that's really how
it's being done now.

06:00.695 --> 06:01.774
You ever hear of a movie called

06:01.775 --> 06:03.774
- "Curse of Shelter Island"?
- They made that on a phone?

06:03.775 --> 06:05.614
No, they never made it.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.765
Our dad wrote it in 1970,
and he turned 70 this year,

06:07.775 --> 06:09.725
so we're making it as a gift for him.

06:09.735 --> 06:10.745
That's awesome.

06:10.755 --> 06:13.825
Rachel! Are you hurt? Are you okay?

06:13.835 --> 06:15.625
I'm fine, Bree.

06:15.635 --> 06:17.784
Okay. Good.

06:17.785 --> 06:19.624
Also, I'm okay.

06:19.625 --> 06:21.695
Yeah, what's not okay

06:21.705 --> 06:23.625
is you went a little early, Rach.

06:23.635 --> 06:25.685
If I didn't have to wear
those stupid contacts...

06:25.695 --> 06:27.615
Well, you do, I'm sorry.
You guys have to match.

06:27.625 --> 06:28.725
We're gonna have to light you up again.

06:28.735 --> 06:29.745
Hope there's enough protective gel.

06:29.755 --> 06:31.805
- You hope?
- Come on, Bree.

06:33.665 --> 06:35.775
So how long have you
been a stunt person?

06:35.785 --> 06:37.685
Professionally, the last five years,

06:37.695 --> 06:38.745
but really, my whole life.

06:38.755 --> 06:40.704
I'm a dedicated adrenaline junkie.

06:40.705 --> 06:43.655
I'm familiar with the impulse.
I used to be an ER doctor.

06:43.665 --> 06:44.744
Oh, yeah? What happened?

06:44.745 --> 06:46.825
I settled down and became
a concierge doctor.

06:46.835 --> 06:49.745
- Now I make house calls.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

06:49.755 --> 06:51.634
Oh, no, don't be. I'm
much happier this way.

06:51.635 --> 06:53.625
Guess that would never be me.

06:53.635 --> 06:55.615
I like to skate as close
to the edge as I can get.

06:55.625 --> 06:56.834
Uh, you guys don't happen to have

06:56.835 --> 06:58.754
any medical support
staff on this, do you?

06:58.755 --> 07:03.615
We have a dermatologist
friend who lets us text him.

07:03.625 --> 07:05.754
Good news, Rach. Got
enough gel for one more.

07:05.755 --> 07:07.695
Oh, okay, great.

07:07.705 --> 07:09.785
Uh, listen, I hope we
don't need to meet again,

07:09.795 --> 07:11.674
- but just in case.
- Okay, thanks.

07:11.675 --> 07:13.605
Yeah.

07:27.755 --> 07:31.745
So, uh... three things, actually.

07:31.755 --> 07:34.635
First, here's a draft of
the letter you asked for

07:34.645 --> 07:36.835
disclosing the data hack.

07:37.605 --> 07:39.604
Second, Lewis tells me the
hackers were in our system

07:39.605 --> 07:40.715
for about three hours.

07:40.725 --> 07:42.675
He thinks it could be state-sponsored,

07:42.685 --> 07:45.605
in which case we'd have
to bring in the FBI.

07:45.615 --> 07:46.684
Unless you'd like to do that now.

07:46.685 --> 07:49.705
And the third thing?

07:49.715 --> 07:52.625
The third thing is an apology.

07:52.635 --> 07:53.745
I let you down.

07:53.755 --> 07:55.644
More importantly, I let
the hospital down.

07:55.645 --> 07:58.705
So, uh... I'm sorry.

07:58.715 --> 08:00.725
But I'm here to make it right.

08:00.735 --> 08:02.675
You're offering to resign.

08:02.685 --> 08:05.795
What? No, I... no.

08:05.805 --> 08:09.675
I mean, I... wasn't, unless... I am.

08:09.685 --> 08:11.685
Is that what you're saying I should do?

08:11.695 --> 08:14.775
- Absolutely not.
- Oh! Well...

08:14.785 --> 08:16.655
Wow. Thank you. Great, I mean, I...

08:16.665 --> 08:17.835
Volunteering for the guillotine

08:18.605 --> 08:20.835
is a craven gesture.

08:21.605 --> 08:22.725
If your head needs to roll,

08:22.735 --> 08:25.755
I will be the one to drop the blade.

08:26.815 --> 08:28.785
Got it.

08:37.825 --> 08:39.725
You sure you're okay to drive?

08:39.735 --> 08:41.765
I'm pregnant, not drunk!

08:41.775 --> 08:43.804
Hormones can also impair one's judgment.

08:45.735 --> 08:47.685
But you seem fine.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.725
So... why don't you want
your parents to stay?

08:53.735 --> 08:56.624
Oh, this is just a stop-off
on their park tour.

08:56.625 --> 08:57.805
They're not really here to see me.

08:57.815 --> 09:00.664
Of course they are.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.744
And... you ought to
spend time with them.

09:03.745 --> 09:05.815
- Before they're gone.
- Oh, that's years away.

09:05.825 --> 09:07.815
Barring accidents.

09:09.625 --> 09:10.825
You meant gone on their park tour.

09:10.835 --> 09:12.744
I did.

09:12.745 --> 09:14.605
We've never really been close,

09:14.615 --> 09:15.815
even when I was little.

09:15.825 --> 09:18.704
That's why they have dogs.

09:18.705 --> 09:21.704
I'm sorry, I-I don't follow.

09:21.705 --> 09:25.605
Well, growing up, I found...

09:25.615 --> 09:27.784
hugging and touching overwhelming.

09:27.785 --> 09:29.744
I-I knew they wanted that from me,

09:29.745 --> 09:31.645
but, um, I couldn't give it to them,

09:31.655 --> 09:34.645
so when I turned five,
they got their first dog.

09:34.655 --> 09:37.665
Buddy. Part Lab, part Shepherd.
Very affectionate.

09:37.675 --> 09:40.705
Probably the best available solution.

09:40.715 --> 09:43.635
Jeremiah, I'm sure that's not true.

09:44.745 --> 09:46.765
Why?

09:54.715 --> 09:55.834
American businesswoman

09:55.835 --> 09:58.785
and political candidate Diana Underhill

09:58.795 --> 10:01.794
is the latest high-profile
victim of a hacking incident,

10:01.795 --> 10:04.695
this one at a New York area hospital.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.754
The news of her
endometriosis was revealed

10:06.755 --> 10:08.625
after an unknown perpetrator

10:08.635 --> 10:10.755
was able to gain access
to hospital computers.

10:10.765 --> 10:12.755
- Yes?

10:12.765 --> 10:14.745
Mr. Lawson.

10:14.755 --> 10:16.714
Thank you. So kind of you to visit.

10:16.715 --> 10:19.635
Uh, yes, I wish it were just for that.

10:19.645 --> 10:21.605
Uh, Ms. Underhill, I
just wanted to apologize

10:21.615 --> 10:22.755
to you personally for
this hacking incident.

10:22.765 --> 10:24.725
I assure you we're doing
everything we can

10:24.735 --> 10:26.675
to seal the leak and repair the damage,

10:26.685 --> 10:27.805
and I just wanted you
to hear it from me.

10:27.815 --> 10:29.835
Well, I appreciate that. I do,

10:30.605 --> 10:33.635
but as you can see, the
damage has been done.

10:33.645 --> 10:35.644
Safely from her diagnosis...

10:35.645 --> 10:37.705
Well, this is just one show, right?

10:37.715 --> 10:40.645
- This once proud...
- Political hopeful Diana...

10:40.655 --> 10:42.745
- Well, that...
- New York Senate candidate...

10:42.755 --> 10:45.725
Again, I am so... so sorry.

10:46.775 --> 10:48.724
On the bright side, Mr. Lawson,

10:48.725 --> 10:50.645
now I have a few more campaign issues

10:50.655 --> 10:51.804
to which I intend to speak personally

10:51.805 --> 10:54.644
like privacy, cyber security,

10:54.645 --> 10:56.715
how our health care
system is being run by

10:56.725 --> 10:58.705
marginally competent bureaucrats.

10:58.715 --> 11:01.605
That doesn't include me, right?

11:03.745 --> 11:06.614
I need to address this, Mr. Lawson,

11:06.615 --> 11:08.715
and you and your hospital
need to be held accountable.

11:08.725 --> 11:11.694
Right, but... can you address it

11:11.695 --> 11:13.735
in general terms, like...

11:13.745 --> 11:15.675
without the human sacrifice?

11:15.685 --> 11:17.654
I could.

11:17.655 --> 11:20.765
But you know, America
loves a good story.

11:20.775 --> 11:24.694
Especially one with a
hero and a villain.

11:24.695 --> 11:26.654
And in this one, Mr. Lawson,

11:26.655 --> 11:29.685
I'm afraid you are the villain.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.675
Huh.

11:40.719 --> 11:42.689
First Boris tears you a new one,

11:42.699 --> 11:43.809
then Diana Underhill.

11:43.819 --> 11:45.699
It's a good thing you
work in a hospital.

11:45.709 --> 11:47.699
Yeah. Maybe I can find
you an empathy donor.

11:47.709 --> 11:49.709
Hey, you hear from Dad?

11:49.719 --> 11:50.789
Nope. You?

11:50.799 --> 11:53.749
Nope. Not me, not you, not Newberg.

11:53.759 --> 11:55.748
Not even his book editor.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.788
I can't even comprehend it.

11:58.789 --> 12:00.849
How does a guy just walk
out on people like that?

12:00.859 --> 12:02.909
Practice.

12:02.919 --> 12:05.828
- This is different, though.
- How?

12:05.829 --> 12:08.708
Because I genuinely
thought he'd changed.

12:08.709 --> 12:10.908
Like... I don't even
wanna find him, Henry.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.130
I feel like I'm done with him.

12:13.140 --> 12:16.160
And I feel like that's
easier said than done.

12:16.170 --> 12:18.160
So what's with Boris
threatening to fire you?

12:18.170 --> 12:20.160
It's not like you hacked
into the hospital computers

12:20.170 --> 12:21.229
and stole everyone's information.

12:21.230 --> 12:23.190
Could you keep it down
just a little bit? Thanks.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.150
I don't know... it happened on my watch.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.309
It's on me. What am I gonna do?

12:26.310 --> 12:28.109
Wallow in a Barcalounger

12:28.110 --> 12:30.110
watching "Jerry Springer"
reruns all day?

12:30.120 --> 12:32.110
Kinda like you back in
Brooklyn, actually.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.180
Yeah, I remember.

12:35.180 --> 12:36.270
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.189
I'm gonna talk to Boris
about this for you.

12:38.190 --> 12:40.309
What are... no, you won't.

12:40.310 --> 12:42.180
I'm not seven, Henry.

12:42.190 --> 12:43.260
This is not a school playground.

12:43.270 --> 12:45.110
I can battle a cybercriminal,
a billionaire,

12:45.120 --> 12:47.180
- and a Senator on my own.
- Okay, simmer down, "Avengers."

12:47.190 --> 12:49.189
- I'm just trying to help.
- Well, I don't want your help.

12:49.190 --> 12:51.220
- I'm an adult.
- Oh, well excuse me for caring.

12:51.230 --> 12:53.109
Well, maybe try caring less.

12:53.213 --> 12:54.373
You know, at the moment, I'm
not sure I could care less.

12:54.383 --> 12:56.213
Oh, that's... That's real good.

12:56.223 --> 12:57.393
It's rich. Real rich.

13:01.373 --> 13:04.373
- See you at the barbecue.
- Yeah, can't wait.

13:04.383 --> 13:07.293
And don't forget to bring chips!

13:07.303 --> 13:09.262
This is my floor... no, no...

13:14.343 --> 13:18.262
So... now we are not only married,

13:18.263 --> 13:22.262
but we have my daughter and his twins,

13:22.263 --> 13:25.213
and another boy or girl on the way.

13:25.223 --> 13:26.253
Which, of course, is the perfect time

13:26.263 --> 13:27.382
for me to be starting medical school.

13:29.223 --> 13:31.343
I am so sorry.

13:31.353 --> 13:33.005
I don't know why I just
told you all of that.

13:33.115 --> 13:35.606
Oh, I have that effect on people...
it's my gift.

13:35.701 --> 13:37.721
Sometimes my burden, but...

13:37.731 --> 13:39.850
it's my calling and it
gives my life purpose.

13:39.851 --> 13:42.761
- Oh, so you're a...
- Hairdresser.

13:45.888 --> 13:47.559
You and your son

13:47.638 --> 13:48.677
could not be more different.

13:48.755 --> 13:49.795
I know.

13:49.805 --> 13:51.865
Well...

13:51.875 --> 13:54.865
that quiet distance he keeps...

13:54.982 --> 13:56.991
Chuck made his peace with it long ago,

13:57.055 --> 14:00.055
long before we even knew
that there was a...

14:00.080 --> 14:02.980
spectrum that, uh, Jerry might be on.

14:02.990 --> 14:06.170
But, you know, they
can always talk about

14:06.940 --> 14:08.950
the weather or...

14:08.960 --> 14:11.010
a ballgame or traffic even.

14:11.020 --> 14:15.050
You know men.

14:15.060 --> 14:16.989
But a mother needs a little bit more,

14:16.990 --> 14:20.110
needs to know she's... needed.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.990
Needs to know she's loved.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.069
Needs to know she might have done

14:25.070 --> 14:28.990
something right.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.070
But, uh, you know, I...

14:31.080 --> 14:33.070
I've never gotten that from Jerry,

14:33.080 --> 14:35.950
and I don't imagine that I ever will.

14:38.040 --> 14:41.140
He may be more capable than you think.

14:41.150 --> 14:43.950
When we were roommates...

14:43.960 --> 14:45.990
Roommates?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.990
Well, I'm finding more
about his life from you

14:48.000 --> 14:50.150
than I ever have from him.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.990
I know... that it can
be hard to connect.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.980
But you can't give up.

14:56.990 --> 14:59.140
Oh, I won't, I won't. I just...

14:59.150 --> 15:01.940
What?

15:01.950 --> 15:04.160
I don't know, maybe I have
given up a little bit.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.959
Maybe I need to make my peace with it.

15:06.960 --> 15:09.129
You do not strike me as
a surrendering type.

15:09.130 --> 15:12.089
I'm not.

15:12.090 --> 15:15.130
But you know, after all these years...

15:19.010 --> 15:21.070
I'm a little defeated.

15:27.980 --> 15:29.140
Rehearsing!

15:34.317 --> 15:35.366
It's bad, isn't it?

15:35.366 --> 15:37.206
Well, it's not good, but it's...

15:37.216 --> 15:39.276
I knew it! First Rachel, now me.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.146
You know what this is, don't you?

15:41.156 --> 15:42.196
- I actu...
- It's the curse

15:42.206 --> 15:43.325
of "The Curse of Shelter Island."

15:43.326 --> 15:45.166
It's the what of the what now?

15:45.176 --> 15:46.356
Rachel and Doug didn't tell you,

15:46.366 --> 15:49.186
but the reason their dad's
movie never got made

15:49.196 --> 15:50.335
is because it was cursed.

15:50.336 --> 15:52.236
The director disappeared.

15:52.246 --> 15:55.286
The lead actor was in some
mysterious car accident.

15:55.296 --> 15:57.295
And the business manager for the agent

15:57.296 --> 16:00.136
who represented the actress
who played my role

16:00.146 --> 16:03.276
- died of scabies.
- Scabies isn't fatal.

16:03.286 --> 16:07.246
That's how bad the curse is.
It was disaster upon disaster

16:07.256 --> 16:09.136
until the studio had to shut it down.

16:09.146 --> 16:11.135
So what do I have?

16:11.136 --> 16:13.296
Hepatitis? Meningitis? Leprosy?

16:13.306 --> 16:16.255
No. Just a slight case of
self-fulfilling prophecy.

16:16.256 --> 16:17.335
What?

16:17.336 --> 16:20.216
Stress weakens your immune system.

16:20.226 --> 16:21.366
A weak immune system can allow

16:22.136 --> 16:24.326
a dormant chicken pox virus to reawaken.

16:24.336 --> 16:27.196
I think your stress about the
curse is what caused this.

16:27.206 --> 16:30.215
This being shingles. You have shingles.

16:30.216 --> 16:32.136
So... I'm sick

16:32.146 --> 16:34.246
because I was stressing
about being sick?

16:34.256 --> 16:36.265
Hence my diagnosis of
self-fulfilling prophecy,

16:36.266 --> 16:38.136
which also isn't fatal.

16:38.146 --> 16:39.336
So there's no curse.

16:39.346 --> 16:41.216
No curse.

16:41.226 --> 16:43.296
You're sure it's just shingles?

16:43.306 --> 16:45.265
Positive. But you can text
your dermatologist friend

16:45.266 --> 16:47.265
if you like, or I can just go ahead

16:47.266 --> 16:49.166
and prescribe you some
Valtrex, which is...

16:49.176 --> 16:51.136
I know what it is. Show business.

16:51.146 --> 16:52.206
Right.

16:54.236 --> 16:55.326
Whoa!

16:55.336 --> 16:57.265
That was really good.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.246
That wasn't supposed to happen.

17:00.256 --> 17:01.296
Rachel!

17:01.306 --> 17:03.266
Rachel!

17:03.276 --> 17:06.336
Rachel, hey, are you okay?

17:10.346 --> 17:12.136
I don't know.

17:12.146 --> 17:13.346
I think I passed out for a second.

17:15.286 --> 17:17.236
Did you pass out during
that fire stunt too?

17:17.246 --> 17:19.185
Is that maybe why you went early?

17:19.195 --> 17:21.175
Maybe.

17:21.185 --> 17:22.236
Okay, listen to me.

17:22.246 --> 17:24.146
Skating close to the edge is one thing,

17:24.156 --> 17:26.266
but passing out twice for
no reason is another.

17:26.276 --> 17:28.306
I'm taking you to the hospital.

17:28.316 --> 17:31.206
Still think there's no curse?

17:40.156 --> 17:42.275
Looks normal.

17:42.276 --> 17:44.235
Well, your EEG looks normal.

17:44.236 --> 17:46.186
So what's going on then?

17:46.196 --> 17:48.226
Can't say for sure until
your blood work's back,

17:48.236 --> 17:50.195
but I'm concerned about seizures.

17:50.196 --> 17:52.156
Although you say this hasn't happened

17:52.166 --> 17:54.195
- outside these two instances.
- No. Never.

17:54.196 --> 17:55.245
Okay.

17:55.246 --> 17:57.356
What about that face-plant
your brother mentioned?

17:57.366 --> 17:59.166
That was different.

17:59.176 --> 18:00.246
I remember that whole thing
from start to finish.

18:00.256 --> 18:03.205
Right. All right, I want
to do an ambulatory EEG.

18:03.206 --> 18:04.316
So you'll keep the cap on,

18:04.326 --> 18:06.226
but I'll attach it to a portable monitor

18:06.236 --> 18:08.325
you'll carry with you for 24 hours.

18:08.326 --> 18:10.236
Okay, that's fine,

18:10.246 --> 18:12.346
but I can't do it till
after the last stunt.

18:12.356 --> 18:14.316
Rachel, listen to me.
Sometimes your body

18:14.326 --> 18:16.196
has ways of telling you
it's time to ease up

18:16.206 --> 18:17.266
on the adrenaline.

18:17.276 --> 18:19.326
And sometimes that's a
story you tell yourself

18:19.336 --> 18:21.206
to justify your circumstances.

18:21.216 --> 18:23.205
You talking about me?

18:23.206 --> 18:25.365
Look, adrenaline junkies don't
just settle down, Hank.

18:25.366 --> 18:28.236
That crazy rush we get from wondering

18:28.246 --> 18:29.246
"Am I gonna make it through this?"

18:29.256 --> 18:31.205
That's what makes us feel alive.

18:31.206 --> 18:33.266
Isn't there a part of
you that misses that?

18:33.276 --> 18:36.135
Sure, sure, sometimes,

18:36.136 --> 18:38.255
but let's deal with you first.
You can't do the stunt.

18:38.256 --> 18:40.276
And you can say that, but
I'm doing the stunt.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.295
- Rachel, I'm telling you...
- Look...

18:41.296 --> 18:43.246
this is really important to me

18:43.256 --> 18:45.246
and my dad and my brother.

18:45.256 --> 18:47.166
So unless you put me
in a straitjacket...

18:47.176 --> 18:48.215
which actually wouldn't work,

18:48.216 --> 18:49.366
'cause I know how to get out of one...

18:50.136 --> 18:52.196
I'm doing the stunt.

18:52.206 --> 18:55.316
All right. Then I'm coming with you.

19:04.176 --> 19:05.366
Oh, good.

19:06.136 --> 19:07.216
Hi.

19:11.176 --> 19:13.216
So if you press the tip
of your middle finger

19:13.226 --> 19:14.316
to the tip of your thumb,

19:14.326 --> 19:16.246
that fleshy area right under your thumb

19:16.256 --> 19:18.346
is what medium-rare feels like.

19:20.176 --> 19:22.186
- Yeah.
- And that one's yours now,

19:22.196 --> 19:23.366
- right?
- Ha. Right. Yes.

19:24.136 --> 19:25.146
Leave it to a doctor

19:25.156 --> 19:26.306
to make grilling a teachable moment.

19:26.316 --> 19:29.216
What can I say? Science is everywhere.

19:29.226 --> 19:31.256
Hey, you wanna practice
your curve ball tomorrow?

19:31.266 --> 19:33.366
Can't. I'm going to
visit my dad, remember?

19:34.136 --> 19:35.265
Ah, right. Idaho.

19:35.266 --> 19:36.345
I'm gonna get another soda.

19:36.346 --> 19:39.136
- Okay.
- Um...

19:39.146 --> 19:40.225
How's your curve ball?

19:40.226 --> 19:42.226
It's not so good.

19:42.236 --> 19:43.225
Which is actually why I was thinking

19:43.226 --> 19:46.256
more along the lines of, um... dinner.

19:46.266 --> 19:48.265
Maybe like a real grown-up dinner?

19:48.266 --> 19:50.136
Grown-up, huh? Does that mean

19:50.146 --> 19:51.326
we couldn't get crayons
to color on our menus?

19:51.336 --> 19:52.336
Oh, no, we would get crayons.

19:52.346 --> 19:54.206
- Okay, I'm in.
- Okay.

19:54.216 --> 19:57.216
I am so glad you like
my cheese ball, Divya.

19:57.226 --> 19:59.216
Like it? I cannot stop eating it.

19:59.226 --> 20:01.355
Jeremiah.

20:01.356 --> 20:04.196
Did your mom always cook like this?

20:04.206 --> 20:07.136
Yes, food was often molded into shapes.

20:07.146 --> 20:09.136
Balls, rings, bars.

20:09.146 --> 20:11.186
Logs. Loaves. Squares.

20:11.196 --> 20:13.315
Cups. Domes. Triangles.

20:13.316 --> 20:16.155
Towers.

20:16.156 --> 20:17.355
A tower's a structure, not a shape.

20:17.356 --> 20:20.156
Wedges. Hey, Jeremiah,

20:20.166 --> 20:22.146
um... why don't you tell your parents

20:22.156 --> 20:23.236
what you're working on.

20:23.246 --> 20:25.316
Oh, I-it's rather technical.

20:25.326 --> 20:28.266
Try us. We might surprise you.

20:30.236 --> 20:32.346
Well, there are these
things called virusomes.

20:32.356 --> 20:36.146
which are... unilamellar
phospholipid vesicles

20:36.156 --> 20:39.275
incorporating virus-derived
but non-infectious proteins

20:39.276 --> 20:42.186
that facilitate the delivery
of a drug or a vaccine.

20:42.196 --> 20:47.246
I'm attempting to engineer
a new kind of virosome.

20:47.256 --> 20:49.165
Well...

20:49.166 --> 20:51.276
that's very interesting.

20:53.206 --> 20:56.205
I hear it's supposed to rain next week.

20:56.206 --> 20:57.366
Uh, Dr. Lawson?

20:58.136 --> 20:59.286
Hi. Hi.

20:59.296 --> 21:01.286
What in the name of
sweet Jesus are these?

21:01.296 --> 21:03.266
They're chips, per your demand.

21:03.276 --> 21:05.286
They are tortilla chips.

21:05.296 --> 21:07.226
They are generic tortilla chips.

21:07.236 --> 21:08.346
They are so generic, Henry,

21:08.356 --> 21:10.325
they don't even list ingredients...
nothing!

21:10.326 --> 21:12.356
It's mean. Paige thinks
so too, by the way.

21:12.366 --> 21:14.276
Oh, she's on now because of the chips?

21:14.286 --> 21:16.276
- That's ridiculous.
- He says you're ridiculous.

21:16.286 --> 21:18.236
No, I did not. I said you're ridiculous.

21:18.246 --> 21:19.325
Why would you buy generic chips?

21:19.326 --> 21:20.365
- Everyone's happy...
- They're tortilla chips!

21:20.366 --> 21:23.215
- Hey, hey, guys, easy.
- Oh, my God.

21:23.216 --> 21:25.196
Save it for Thanksgiving.

21:25.206 --> 21:27.326
I have mustards to organize.

21:30.176 --> 21:32.366
Oh... what is it with families?

21:33.136 --> 21:35.206
I know... you try to help,
and they get all insulted.

21:35.216 --> 21:36.236
You try to help,

21:36.246 --> 21:38.216
and you might as well be invisible.

21:38.226 --> 21:39.316
Whose family are you talking about?

21:39.326 --> 21:41.215
Well, Jeremiah's.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.335
They want to connect so badly,
but they don't know how.

21:43.336 --> 21:46.196
I'm trying to facilitate,
but it's not going so well.

21:46.206 --> 21:49.135
Well, be careful. Families
can be like magnets.

21:49.136 --> 21:50.215
The more you try to push them together,

21:50.216 --> 21:51.246
the more they slide apart.

21:51.256 --> 21:53.196
Unless you turn them around.

21:53.206 --> 21:54.256
Hmm.

21:54.266 --> 21:56.296
Hi. I'm Barb. I'm Jerry's mom.

21:56.306 --> 21:58.175
How do you do?

21:58.176 --> 22:00.295
Boris Kuester von Jurgens-Ratenicz.

22:00.296 --> 22:02.296
Hey, there. Chuck Sacani.

22:02.306 --> 22:05.226
Sacani Motors? What do you drive?

22:05.236 --> 22:08.266
I, uh... don't.

22:08.276 --> 22:10.216
Boris, what a nice surprise.

22:10.226 --> 22:11.266
- Excuse us.
- Pleasure.

22:11.276 --> 22:13.345
This thing over...

22:13.346 --> 22:15.206
- Yeah. Evan.
- Ah.

22:15.216 --> 22:18.256
- Oh.
- For you, gentlemen.

22:18.266 --> 22:20.146
Oh, nice.

22:20.156 --> 22:22.336
"1982 Calon Suger."

22:22.346 --> 22:24.136
Ségur. Yes.

22:24.146 --> 22:27.256
It... risks overwhelming
the hamburger sandwiches,

22:27.266 --> 22:29.246
but it will be worth it.

22:29.256 --> 22:32.185
I'm just glad it's not a
giant metaphorical axe.

22:32.186 --> 22:35.266
No. I was... overly
severe with you earlier.

22:35.276 --> 22:39.186
- My apologies.
- Thank you, Boris.

22:39.196 --> 22:41.166
You were upset and with good reason.

22:41.176 --> 22:42.345
Yeah, multiple reasons.

22:42.346 --> 22:45.176
Some pertaining to my
pharmaceutical company,

22:45.186 --> 22:48.226
but primarily because I was
forced to delay my trip

22:48.236 --> 22:50.155
to see Marisa and Carlos.

22:50.156 --> 22:52.275
Totally understood. Happy you came.

22:52.276 --> 22:54.186
I'm gonna go pop this guy open.

22:54.196 --> 22:56.146
Good.

22:56.156 --> 22:57.275
So you've been missing your family.

22:57.276 --> 22:59.315
Yeah. Very much so.

22:59.316 --> 23:01.356
Particularly because...

23:01.366 --> 23:04.266
Carlos is about to receive
his first treatment

23:04.276 --> 23:08.236
of our new pediatric drug protocol.

23:08.246 --> 23:10.216
Pediatric drug... for what?

23:10.226 --> 23:13.176
My family's disease.

23:13.186 --> 23:15.266
He has the marker too, Hank.

23:32.499 --> 23:34.538
Hey, man, sorry it's taking so long,

23:34.539 --> 23:36.459
but I finally have some news.

23:36.468 --> 23:37.617
Good or bad?

23:37.619 --> 23:40.429
Uh... both?

23:45.469 --> 23:47.439
Hi.

23:47.449 --> 23:49.459
We need to talk.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.498
My attorneys will be
glad to speak with you.

23:51.499 --> 23:53.619
You leaked your own medical record.

23:55.609 --> 23:56.870
What?

23:57.019 --> 23:59.915
I just found out that none of
our patients' medical records

23:59.924 --> 24:02.084
were copied or even
opened, for that matter.

24:02.095 --> 24:06.054
Yet somehow, right after you
found out about the hack,

24:06.055 --> 24:09.104
your information was mysteriously...

24:09.105 --> 24:11.064
everywhere.

24:11.065 --> 24:13.125
Because you...

24:13.135 --> 24:16.104
wanted it that way.

24:16.105 --> 24:19.015
That's absurd.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.085
Is it, though?

24:21.785 --> 24:22.935
You're on every channel.

24:22.945 --> 24:24.775
You've got three new issues

24:24.785 --> 24:25.904
to which you can now speak personally,

24:25.904 --> 24:27.743
including an illness

24:27.745 --> 24:29.784
that makes people feel
sympathy towards you.

24:31.744 --> 24:32.903
It was a shrewd move, Ms. Underhill.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.825
It was... It was very shrewd.

24:34.835 --> 24:37.765
What do you want, Mr. Lawson?

24:38.945 --> 24:40.895
Well, you know, Ms. Underhill,

24:40.905 --> 24:42.944
America loves a good story,

24:42.945 --> 24:45.885
especially one with a
hero and a villain,

24:45.895 --> 24:49.795
but you know what I think
they're gonna love even more?

24:49.805 --> 24:52.845
A story with... two heroes.

24:57.805 --> 24:59.755
Oh...

24:59.764 --> 25:01.804
Thank you for trusting
us with your care.

25:10.755 --> 25:11.874
I already said good-bye to them once

25:11.875 --> 25:12.975
and then again at the cookout.

25:13.745 --> 25:15.745
It doesn't make sense
to say it a third time.

25:15.755 --> 25:17.795
It's your family. It's not
supposed to make sense.

25:17.805 --> 25:19.925
It's just what you do.

25:23.845 --> 25:24.905
They're not home.

25:24.915 --> 25:28.785
This is their car. They
have to be somewhere close.

25:29.915 --> 25:33.765
Hello! Somebody! Anybody!

25:33.775 --> 25:35.844
- Hello?
- Mom?

25:35.845 --> 25:38.785
Oh, Jerry, hi! Oh, good, come quick.

25:38.795 --> 25:40.804
Come quick. Something's
wrong with Rosie.

25:40.805 --> 25:43.765
She started to throw up,
and now she won't move.

25:45.765 --> 25:46.875
I'm not a vet.

25:46.885 --> 25:48.924
"First do no harm." I know the rules.

25:48.924 --> 25:51.944
We own every episode of
"DIAGNOSIS: Murder!"

26:14.975 --> 26:16.875
Hello, I'm Dr. Sacani.

26:16.885 --> 26:18.845
I'm gonna palpate your abdomen now.

26:23.815 --> 26:24.965
Your dog isn't sick. She's in labor.

26:24.975 --> 26:27.854
That's impossible. She
was fixed at the shelter

26:27.855 --> 26:29.894
before we even got her. We paid a fee!

26:29.895 --> 26:30.974
Then you should get a refund.

26:30.975 --> 26:32.854
Is she gonna be okay?

26:32.855 --> 26:34.885
I don't know. Maybe an
ultrasound would help.

26:34.895 --> 26:36.935
Okay, I'll run and get it from the car.

26:41.935 --> 26:44.855
How far are you parked?

26:55.825 --> 26:57.965
She's okay to do this, right?

26:57.975 --> 26:59.824
Oh, I'd rather she didn't,

26:59.825 --> 27:01.845
but I haven't been able
to convince her not to.

27:01.855 --> 27:03.855
And medically, she does check out.

27:03.865 --> 27:05.865
So what's gonna happen here?

27:05.875 --> 27:08.824
Car's gonna come screaming
down the driveway,

27:08.825 --> 27:10.825
across the lawn, down the ramp,

27:10.835 --> 27:12.864
into the water, burst into flames.

27:12.865 --> 27:13.925
Why does it burst into flames

27:13.935 --> 27:15.815
if it's in the water?

27:15.825 --> 27:16.965
Because the possessed
can telekinetically

27:16.975 --> 27:18.855
manipulate things on a molecular level.

27:18.865 --> 27:20.885
- Ah. Okay.
- It's set up in act one.

27:20.895 --> 27:22.945
Speaking of the possessed,
got the contacts in?

27:22.955 --> 27:25.935
Nice. I wanna go to you
as soon as we get this.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.815
No matter how many times
I see those things,

27:27.825 --> 27:28.885
they still creep me out.

27:28.895 --> 27:30.784
That's the idea.

27:30.785 --> 27:32.925
Rachel hates them. She's
fine blowing herself up,

27:32.935 --> 27:34.865
but touch her eyeball, she freaks out.

27:34.875 --> 27:36.815
Huh. Can I see one of those?

27:36.825 --> 27:38.745
- Sure.
- Thanks.

27:38.755 --> 27:40.794
Okay, let's roll.

27:40.795 --> 27:41.914
These are hard lenses.

27:41.915 --> 27:44.785
Does Rachel put these in right
before she does a stunt?

27:44.919 --> 27:46.778
As last-minute as she can.

27:48.091 --> 27:50.589
When I said, "Let's roll," I
didn't mean it literally.

27:50.614 --> 27:53.454
Why is she going so slow?

27:54.564 --> 27:56.692
Because of these. Rachel!

27:57.184 --> 27:59.104
Rachel!

28:00.274 --> 28:03.054
Rachel, are you okay?

28:05.104 --> 28:07.234
I can't feel a pulse.

28:11.231 --> 28:13.547
She's severely bradycardic.
Her pulse is so low,

28:13.572 --> 28:15.671
it's barely even there.
She needs Atropine.

28:29.602 --> 28:31.502
She's not responding.

28:31.513 --> 28:33.613
I'm gonna externally pace her.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.462
I'm afraid this is going
to hurt quite a bit.

28:45.472 --> 28:46.672
Well, pain amuses her, remember?

28:46.682 --> 28:49.462
Yeah, well, lucky her.

28:55.622 --> 28:57.602
Ah!

29:00.533 --> 29:02.513
It happened again. Why?

29:02.522 --> 29:04.602
First, let's get these out.

29:08.453 --> 29:10.523
Okay.

29:10.532 --> 29:13.542
Now, any pain

29:13.552 --> 29:16.601
here... here...

29:16.602 --> 29:19.542
Ow! Yeah, that's from my
face-plant last week.

29:19.552 --> 29:21.622
Okay. So is all your fainting.

29:21.632 --> 29:23.592
What?

29:23.602 --> 29:25.472
That face-plant resulted in a fracture

29:25.482 --> 29:26.662
that trapped your trigeminal nerve,

29:26.672 --> 29:28.622
so now when you put
pressure on your eyeball,

29:28.632 --> 29:30.642
it's creating an oculocardiac reflex,

29:30.652 --> 29:32.522
dropping your heart rate.

29:32.532 --> 29:34.561
So when I put my contacts in,

29:34.562 --> 29:36.512
it slowed my heart down?

29:36.522 --> 29:39.451
Yeah. And this time, it
almost didn't speed up again.

29:39.452 --> 29:40.612
Can you untrap the nerve?

29:40.622 --> 29:42.451
In the hospital, yeah.

29:42.452 --> 29:43.632
It's actually a pretty simple procedure.

29:43.642 --> 29:44.652
So we can finish the movie?

29:44.662 --> 29:46.611
Yeah, but not today.

29:46.612 --> 29:48.592
We'll get back to it once you're fixed.

29:48.602 --> 29:50.611
You're like our good luck charm.

29:50.612 --> 29:52.451
Well, I don't know about that,

29:52.452 --> 29:53.532
but I do think you guys

29:53.542 --> 29:55.651
ought to put this whole
curse business to bed.

29:55.652 --> 29:57.622
There is no such thing.

30:10.532 --> 30:14.472
That's on me. Didn't put it in park.

30:20.502 --> 30:22.582
She's having trouble
delivering the initial puppy

30:22.592 --> 30:25.452
because of its abnormal presentation...
it's tail first.

30:25.462 --> 30:26.541
It's called dystocia.

30:26.542 --> 30:28.572
She should go to a vet.

30:28.582 --> 30:31.542
Or maybe you can manipulate
the puppies digitally.

30:31.552 --> 30:33.582
Everything's digital now.

30:33.592 --> 30:35.501
She means using my fingers.
But I would need you

30:35.502 --> 30:37.492
to kneel down and hold the ultrasound,

30:37.502 --> 30:39.482
which seems unlikely, in light of...

30:39.492 --> 30:40.562
your girth.

30:40.572 --> 30:43.562
I-I'm totally capable of bending over.

30:49.542 --> 30:50.661
Okay, fine. It's not happening.

30:50.662 --> 30:53.461
It's all right. I got it.

30:53.462 --> 30:54.582
- I can do it.
- Uh...

30:54.592 --> 30:56.532
I can do this. Give it to me.

30:56.542 --> 30:58.652
- All right, um...
- Give it to me.

30:58.662 --> 31:00.542
Hold that right against the abdomen.

31:00.552 --> 31:02.592
- Okay.
- That's it.

31:05.512 --> 31:07.502
What's that stuff for?

31:07.512 --> 31:09.512
It's to help guide the puppy
out of the vaginal vault.

31:09.522 --> 31:11.452
Oh, my.

31:18.602 --> 31:21.591
I just need to open the amniotic sack

31:21.592 --> 31:24.472
and cut the umbilical cord.

31:24.482 --> 31:26.462
It's a miracle!

31:26.472 --> 31:28.452
It's really more biology.

31:28.462 --> 31:29.671
No.

31:29.672 --> 31:32.592
I mean you.

31:34.602 --> 31:37.502
- Okay.
- Oh, look at that.

31:37.512 --> 31:39.471
Just look at that.

31:39.472 --> 31:41.502
- Aw...
- Ha ha!

31:41.512 --> 31:43.532
Here, let me have him.

31:46.602 --> 31:49.481
Ah, there you go, little guy.

31:49.482 --> 31:50.522
Hey.

31:56.562 --> 31:57.632
Oh. Here we go.

31:57.642 --> 31:58.682
Oh, another one!

31:59.452 --> 32:00.681
Look at us.

32:00.682 --> 32:03.462
- Out to dinner.
- I know, right?

32:03.472 --> 32:04.622
God, it feels like
this has been building

32:04.632 --> 32:06.462
since I don't know when.

32:06.472 --> 32:08.502
End of last summer. Not
that I'm counting.

32:08.512 --> 32:11.481
Well, I'm sure it
will be worth the wait.

32:11.482 --> 32:13.602
Definitely.

32:13.612 --> 32:15.622
And, hey, you know what
else is worth the wait?

32:15.632 --> 32:18.482
The grilled artichokes
with the lemon aioli.

32:18.492 --> 32:21.641
Mmm! Yeah...

32:21.642 --> 32:24.521
Oh. You... you're not a fan.

32:24.522 --> 32:27.531
It's just all that work to
scrape a bunch of green goo

32:27.532 --> 32:29.592
onto the backs of your teeth...
not for me!

32:29.602 --> 32:31.532
Okay!

32:32.652 --> 32:34.522
- But you should get it.
- No!

32:34.532 --> 32:35.652
- We can get something else.
- But you want it.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.602
Yeah, but I wouldn't be able
to finish it on my own.

32:37.612 --> 32:38.651
Go on, get it. Don't listen to me.

32:38.652 --> 32:40.491
I... no, listen, I don't need it.

32:40.492 --> 32:41.632
We'll do something else.

32:41.642 --> 32:44.611
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:44.612 --> 32:46.571
So Sam's in Idaho.

32:46.572 --> 32:48.652
Yeah! Yeah, he loves it there.

32:48.662 --> 32:51.532
The hunting, the fishing,
horses, rallies.

32:52.612 --> 32:54.642
- Rallies?
- Yeah, like road rallies.

32:54.652 --> 32:56.572
ATVs, four-by-fours, that kinda thing.

32:56.582 --> 32:58.491
Oh, oh.

32:58.492 --> 32:59.651
Whew!

32:59.652 --> 33:01.612
Why, what kind of rallies
were you thinking?

33:01.622 --> 33:03.542
Well... it is Idaho.

33:05.492 --> 33:06.571
So you thought I sent Sam

33:06.572 --> 33:08.572
to some kind of separatist compound?

33:08.582 --> 33:10.682
No. No, of course not.

33:11.452 --> 33:13.502
Okay. Good.

33:13.512 --> 33:15.621
Yeah, no. Never.

33:15.622 --> 33:17.652
But, you know... Idaho.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.682
Let's just not talk about Sam or Idaho.

33:20.452 --> 33:22.522
Right. Of course. New topic.

33:25.582 --> 33:26.682
To us.

33:27.452 --> 33:29.462
It's bad luck to toast with water.

33:29.472 --> 33:31.621
Yeah, I know, but you
don't really believe...

33:31.622 --> 33:33.682
Okay.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.542
So, um...

33:46.662 --> 33:48.541
You gonna get the artichoke?

33:48.542 --> 33:50.582
I think I am, yeah.

33:59.662 --> 34:02.652
You really still don't want to know.

34:02.662 --> 34:04.652
You're the one who didn't want to know.

34:04.662 --> 34:06.472
I know. I didn't want to know.

34:06.482 --> 34:08.551
But I want to know what you want,

34:08.552 --> 34:10.551
independent of what I want.

34:10.552 --> 34:12.672
The truth is, I hadn't
looked at it that way.

34:12.681 --> 34:14.670
I was just, uh...

34:14.672 --> 34:16.552
deferring to you, I guess.

34:18.512 --> 34:20.462
Raj...

34:20.472 --> 34:22.652
I love how comforting and
supportive you've been

34:22.661 --> 34:24.612
about everything,

34:24.621 --> 34:26.492
but for two people
who've known each other

34:26.502 --> 34:27.670
a lifetime, we've somehow ended up

34:27.672 --> 34:29.630
in a whirlwind romance.

34:29.632 --> 34:31.641
Falling in love, getting engaged,

34:31.641 --> 34:33.561
getting married,

34:33.562 --> 34:35.601
and getting pregnant, all in a year.

34:35.601 --> 34:37.521
Mm. Ha ha.

34:37.522 --> 34:39.601
We've made some big decisions, right?

34:39.601 --> 34:42.552
Decisions that would scare most people.

34:42.562 --> 34:45.592
But I guess what's kept
them from scaring me

34:45.601 --> 34:48.482
is knowing that we've been
making them together.

34:50.482 --> 34:53.542
Okay. I do want to know.

34:53.552 --> 34:56.641
- Really?
- I just can't win!

34:56.641 --> 34:58.552
Please, God, let it be a boy.

35:00.512 --> 35:01.552
Ms. Katdare?

35:01.562 --> 35:03.662
- The doctor's ready for you.
- All right.

35:06.562 --> 35:08.492
Come on, honey.

35:10.562 --> 35:12.611
Furthermore, I would like to commend

35:12.612 --> 35:14.632
the excellent care

35:14.642 --> 35:16.651
that I have received
here from the doctors

35:16.652 --> 35:19.651
and the nurses and the staff
at Hamptons Heritage.

35:19.652 --> 35:23.482
You know, I gotta say, it is
private hospitals like this

35:23.492 --> 35:26.592
that set an example of just
what can be accomplished

35:26.602 --> 35:29.632
without government
mandates and interference.

35:29.642 --> 35:32.651
Thank you all so very much.
I gotta get going.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.531
Sorry, but I didn't want to interrupt.

35:34.532 --> 35:36.552
But then I thought I should.
But then I... well...

35:36.562 --> 35:37.651
- Evan.
- Yeah.

35:37.652 --> 35:41.492
- Get on with it.
- Right.

35:43.492 --> 35:46.512
So, uh, Lewis finished his
investigation into the hack.

35:46.522 --> 35:48.522
Yeah? And?

35:48.532 --> 35:50.451
How many were affected?

35:50.452 --> 35:51.552
Well, that's the thing.

35:51.562 --> 35:53.572
He says it was not a massive data grab

35:53.582 --> 35:56.427
like we assumed, but
they were clearly after

35:56.452 --> 35:58.462
only one patient record.

35:58.472 --> 36:01.652
- Yeah?
- Yours.

36:05.462 --> 36:07.532
I see.

36:23.292 --> 36:25.737
I don't know what we would
have done without you.

36:25.995 --> 36:27.955
You would have taken her to a vet.

36:27.965 --> 36:29.947
Bang-up job, Jerry.

36:30.065 --> 36:32.085
Especially for a guy
who doesn't like dogs.

36:32.855 --> 36:34.025
We learned that when
we got Buddy for him

36:34.035 --> 36:35.985
when he was five.

36:35.995 --> 36:38.075
Uh, you got Buddy for you, not for me.

36:38.085 --> 36:39.985
What are you talking?

36:39.995 --> 36:42.955
Why would we get a dog for us?

36:42.965 --> 36:45.995
Because... the dog is capable of giving

36:46.005 --> 36:47.994
physical affection, and I wasn't.

36:47.995 --> 36:51.865
No, Jerry, we got Buddy for you

36:51.875 --> 36:54.074
so you wouldn't be alone.

36:54.075 --> 36:56.855
But I wasn't alone. I had you.

36:56.865 --> 36:59.074
Yeah, sure, but you didn't have...
you know,

36:59.075 --> 37:01.035
other kids.

37:03.075 --> 37:07.945
Y-you got Buddy so that I would have...
a friend?

37:07.955 --> 37:10.015
Yeah. We thought it would help.

37:13.075 --> 37:18.025
I just... I... didn't realize.

37:18.035 --> 37:20.964
all this time, I got it backward

37:20.965 --> 37:23.084
and blamed the entire canine species.

37:23.085 --> 37:26.964
Well, one of these puppies
could be yours if you want.

37:26.965 --> 37:30.005
- Which one?
- Whichever.

37:36.045 --> 37:38.085
You know...

37:38.855 --> 37:40.924
if you are gonna take
one of the puppies,

37:40.925 --> 37:42.075
you'll have to come up with a name.

37:42.085 --> 37:43.924
Mandelbrot.

37:43.925 --> 37:45.964
No, no, not just any name.

37:45.965 --> 37:47.884
You want a name for a dog.

37:47.885 --> 37:50.884
Yes. Mandelbrot.

37:53.055 --> 37:54.965
It's beautiful.

37:56.965 --> 37:58.995
I thought you'd given up on me.

38:00.935 --> 38:03.885
No, Jerry.

38:03.895 --> 38:05.965
Not then.

38:05.975 --> 38:09.875
Not ever.

38:26.935 --> 38:28.934
Way to go, Doc.

38:39.935 --> 38:41.855
Yeah, I figured it was a long shot,

38:41.865 --> 38:42.965
but you are his daughter.

38:42.975 --> 38:46.885
So don't be surprised if he
suddenly shows up on campus.

38:46.895 --> 38:48.885
Okay. Do your homework.

38:48.895 --> 38:50.904
Don't leave those term
papers to the last min...

38:50.905 --> 38:52.064
Okay. I'll shut up now.

38:52.065 --> 38:54.025
Bye, Emma.

39:02.865 --> 39:04.075
Hello!

39:09.905 --> 39:11.945
- Hey.
- Hi!

39:11.955 --> 39:13.064
What are you doing here?

39:13.065 --> 39:15.055
Uh, nothing, just some, you know, files

39:15.065 --> 39:17.025
and HankMed stuff. What
are you doing here?

39:17.035 --> 39:19.895
- I live here.
- That's a fair point.

39:19.905 --> 39:20.984
How was your date?

39:20.985 --> 39:22.865
It had its high points,

39:22.875 --> 39:24.915
which were sadly close
to its low points.

39:24.925 --> 39:26.914
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

39:26.915 --> 39:28.955
Yeah. We put off getting
to know each other

39:28.965 --> 39:30.994
for so long... first
because of her issues,

39:30.995 --> 39:32.874
then because of mine...

39:32.875 --> 39:34.874
that I assumed those would
be our only issues.

39:34.875 --> 39:36.034
Only... they weren't.

39:36.035 --> 39:37.914
- Hmm.
- Hey, there's some

39:37.915 --> 39:39.954
leftover artichokes if you want...
they're really good.

39:39.955 --> 39:42.895
Sure. Yeah. Who doesn't
love leftover artichokes?

39:47.875 --> 39:49.015
Don't worry about your date.

39:49.025 --> 39:50.985
Onward and upward, right?

39:50.995 --> 39:53.855
Yeah, yeah. Onward and upward.

39:53.865 --> 39:55.875
Hey, listen...

39:55.885 --> 39:57.874
I didn't mean to treat you
like a kid yesterday.

39:57.875 --> 40:00.975
It's just with Dad suddenly
disappearing the way he did,

40:00.985 --> 40:03.084
I don't know... maybe it was reflex

40:03.085 --> 40:05.025
because no matter how old you get,

40:05.035 --> 40:06.924
I think there will
always be a part of me

40:06.925 --> 40:08.964
that needs to protect my little brother.

40:08.965 --> 40:11.905
Full disclosure?

40:11.915 --> 40:14.025
Part of me doesn't always mind that.

40:14.035 --> 40:16.044
Especially with a dad as
undependable as ours.

40:16.045 --> 40:18.025
Right.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.885
Is that... your laundry?

40:25.965 --> 40:28.035
We don't have a washer or dryer yet.

40:28.045 --> 40:30.005
So you've been sneaking it in here?

40:30.015 --> 40:31.035
Well, you found me, so technically,

40:31.045 --> 40:32.044
it's not really sneaking anymore.

40:32.045 --> 40:34.965
- Boris.
- Gentlemen.

40:34.975 --> 40:37.035
Evan, I thought you'd
be at the hospital.

40:37.045 --> 40:39.025
I was, and I... and I will be.

40:39.035 --> 40:40.945
- Just, uh...
- He's just doing laundry.

40:40.955 --> 40:42.965
- Yeah.
- Ah.

40:42.975 --> 40:45.974
How... modern.

40:45.975 --> 40:47.085
So I'll just get to it then.

40:47.855 --> 40:49.015
- All right, see you later.
- Okay. See you later.

40:49.025 --> 40:51.014
Hank...

40:51.015 --> 40:52.085
Boris, I don't mean to pry,

40:52.855 --> 40:55.934
but Carlos... what treatment
is he undergoing,

40:55.935 --> 40:58.885
and under whose supervision
and for how long?

40:58.895 --> 40:59.934
All good questions,

40:59.935 --> 41:02.885
best answered in person, perhaps?

41:02.895 --> 41:04.894
I'm off to see him in the morning.

41:04.895 --> 41:06.232
If you were able to join me, I...

41:06.257 --> 41:08.015
Yeah, of course. Consider it done.

41:08.025 --> 41:11.054
Yeah? Excellent. Thank you.

41:11.055 --> 41:13.934
Perhaps at the same
time I can also address

41:13.935 --> 41:16.045
this recent hacking incident.

41:16.055 --> 41:18.934
Yeah. So...

41:18.935 --> 41:20.054
Where is Carlos?

41:20.055 --> 41:22.975
Hong Kong.
