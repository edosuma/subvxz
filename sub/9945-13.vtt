00:07.983 --> 00:11.841
Tickets this way for the Chatsworth Express.

00:11.946 --> 00:15.420
Come and watch pikeys making a mess of the lives

00:15.525 --> 00:21.712
they were given by him upstairs, and kids they're convinced

00:21.816 --> 00:23.972
aren't actually theirs.

00:24.076 --> 00:27.933
What sounds on Earth could ever replace kids needing money,

00:28.038 --> 00:29.950
or wives in your face?

00:30.054 --> 00:32.729
Because this, people reckon, and me included,

00:32.834 --> 00:37.769
is why pubs and drugs were kindly invented,

00:37.874 --> 00:42.426
to calm us all down and stop us going mental.

00:42.531 --> 00:46.597
These are Chatsworth Estate's basic essentials.

00:46.702 --> 00:51.324
We are worth every penny for grinding your axes.

00:51.428 --> 00:55.009
You shit on our heads, but you pay the the taxes.

00:59.076 --> 01:02.969
Imagine a Britain without Chatsworth buccaneers

01:03.073 --> 01:05.993
who'll cum on your face for the price of a beer.

01:06.097 --> 01:08.390
Make poverty history!

01:08.494 --> 01:10.232
Cheaper drugs now.

01:10.337 --> 01:12.875
Make poverty history!

01:12.979 --> 01:14.578
Cheaper drugs now.

01:28.793 --> 01:30.983
Now, most decisions are half-assed.

01:31.086 --> 01:34.006
You know, like not drinking during the week,

01:34.110 --> 01:36.230
or showering every day.

01:36.335 --> 01:38.177
Because you know deep down you're not

01:38.281 --> 01:39.497
going to go through with it.

01:42.174 --> 01:45.581
But when a real decision is made,

01:45.685 --> 01:49.682
you can feel something different, neurons forming,

01:49.786 --> 01:54.373
synapses firing, brain chemistry kicking in.

01:54.478 --> 01:57.050
Reality just needs to catch up with the mind

01:57.154 --> 01:59.657
you've already made up.

01:59.761 --> 02:05.879
Never a strong point, make my mind up, till now.

02:13.664 --> 02:24.578
[soccer video game commentary]

02:24.682 --> 02:25.969
Nice one, Gandalf.

02:26.072 --> 02:27.427
DEBS: Who's Gandalf?

02:27.532 --> 02:29.826
He's a 35-year-old business consultant from London.

02:29.930 --> 02:34.971
Danny Say up so Liam could talk to anybody online.

02:35.074 --> 02:36.186
Liam, bed.

In a minute, Debs.

[crash]

02:42.373 --> 02:43.416
What's going on?

02:43.520 --> 02:44.841
MAN: What you doing?

02:44.946 --> 02:45.988
Who the fuck are you?

02:46.092 --> 02:47.621
Who the fuck are you?

02:47.726 --> 02:48.699
This is our house.

02:48.804 --> 02:49.847
The fuck.

02:49.951 --> 02:51.062
You've just kicked our door in.

02:51.167 --> 02:52.418
Our door?

02:52.522 --> 02:54.399
The council must have gave us the wrong key.

02:54.504 --> 02:56.032
Wrong fucking house, you twat.

02:56.137 --> 02:56.972
Tracy?

03:03.957 --> 03:05.069
What's it say?

03:05.173 --> 03:07.503
It says we don't fucking live here.

03:07.607 --> 03:11.221
Jimmy, Alex, start unpacking.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.821
I don't fucking think so.

03:17.373 --> 03:19.563
Did you see that little shit swing that punch?

03:19.667 --> 03:21.927
I think I chipped my tooth.

03:22.030 --> 03:22.900
Where were you?

03:23.003 --> 03:24.464
Violence doesn't solve anything.

03:24.568 --> 03:26.654
I'll call in a favor with the boys down at the station,

03:26.758 --> 03:30.129
get them kicked out first thing tomorrow.

03:30.234 --> 03:31.763
You should see the other girl.

03:31.868 --> 03:33.535
She tried to tomfool me.

03:33.640 --> 03:37.706
Now the dirty bitch is shopping online for a new fucking chin.

03:37.811 --> 03:39.200
Well, don't you worry, mum.

03:39.305 --> 03:40.834
I give up, son.

03:40.940 --> 03:44.588
Even if I do go out, what the fuck have I got to go back to?

03:44.692 --> 03:48.132
A fucking Irish slaphead smack addict.

03:48.238 --> 03:49.558
I'd rather stay here.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.505
Don't say that, mum.

03:51.609 --> 03:53.138
What you talking about?

04:00.923 --> 04:01.898
What we doing here?

04:02.001 --> 04:02.836
Wait.

04:05.338 --> 04:06.971
Do you reckon?

04:07.075 --> 04:08.640
Bit old.

04:08.745 --> 04:11.594
I know, but she's fucking gagging for it.

04:11.699 --> 04:12.881
What you doing?

04:12.984 --> 04:13.957
Trying to find one you haven't licked.

04:14.062 --> 04:15.313
I only get them for the ketchup.

04:15.417 --> 04:16.495
All right, Huey?

04:16.600 --> 04:19.274
HUEY: All right, Lana.

04:19.380 --> 04:20.630
How's it going?

04:20.735 --> 04:21.709
This is Ches.

04:21.813 --> 04:23.064
Hiya.

04:23.168 --> 04:27.339
Maybe see you later then, both of you.

04:31.371 --> 04:32.900
What the fuck was that?

04:41.555 --> 04:45.135
Joe's pressed charges against mum for the assault.

04:45.239 --> 04:47.499
Let's go down the hospital and we kill him.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.949
My home is your home.

05:01.053 --> 05:03.139
Well, I'm going to turn myself in right now.

05:03.243 --> 05:09.881
Oh, sucker punch me, why don't you, fucking west life.

05:09.986 --> 05:11.897
The fuck do you mean, west life?

05:12.001 --> 05:15.686
I meant it as a compliment, inoffensive,

05:15.791 --> 05:17.633
unthreatening, safe.

05:17.737 --> 05:18.572
Just fuck off.

05:18.676 --> 05:21.073
Yeah.

05:21.177 --> 05:23.541
Look, I don't care how long I get.

05:23.646 --> 05:25.244
I'll do it to spite the bastard.

05:25.348 --> 05:27.190
Jamie, wait.

05:27.295 --> 05:28.164
I'll go see him.

05:28.268 --> 05:29.763
No you fucking won't.

05:29.867 --> 05:32.718
Do I look like I want to?

05:32.822 --> 05:34.038
I'll go tomorrow.

05:55.483 --> 05:57.707
Hi, guys. You're all right.

05:57.810 --> 05:59.132
Come on in, Dougie.

05:59.237 --> 06:01.009
Let's see if you've been practicing your exercises.

[moan]

06:07.855 --> 06:09.351
Nevermind, love.

06:09.455 --> 06:11.262
Got as far as the door this time.

06:11.366 --> 06:12.236
I'll clean you up.

06:16.441 --> 06:17.380
What's going on?

06:17.484 --> 06:19.257
What do you think's going on?

06:19.361 --> 06:20.438
What about her old man?

06:20.542 --> 06:24.470
He's in a taxi shift till 5:00 every morning.

06:24.575 --> 06:26.625
You're not still a virgin, are you, Ches?

06:26.730 --> 06:27.563
Fuck off.

06:27.668 --> 06:29.719
Fucking classic.

06:29.822 --> 06:31.803

06:55.021 --> 06:56.238
You sure this is all right?

06:56.342 --> 06:57.837
Wouldn't have asked you around if it wasn't.

07:02.182 --> 07:04.996
You got nice eyes.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.457
I've got a condom in my wallet.

07:06.561 --> 07:07.742
No, love.

07:07.846 --> 07:09.446
Latex sends me into anaphylactic shock.

07:09.550 --> 07:10.488
It's all right.

07:10.593 --> 07:11.427
I'm on the pill.

07:34.956 --> 07:37.703
Can you hear that?

07:37.806 --> 07:40.484
Sounds like kind of pulse beating or something.

07:40.588 --> 07:41.457
Can't you hear it?

07:46.148 --> 07:48.025
Am I plucking your cherry, Chesney?

07:48.130 --> 07:49.555
No.

07:49.659 --> 07:53.552
I've done it loads of times with--

07:53.657 --> 07:55.915
yeah.

07:56.020 --> 07:58.870
You want my advice?

07:58.974 --> 08:00.504
Go like the clappers, like you've

08:00.608 --> 08:04.397
got five seconds left to live.

Duck to water.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.287
I could go again.

08:34.390 --> 08:35.260
No, no, love.

08:35.365 --> 08:36.720
There were great.

08:36.823 --> 08:38.006
Just the job.

08:38.111 --> 08:39.640
Oh.

08:39.744 --> 08:41.517
Oh.

08:41.621 --> 08:45.236
[music playing]

08:56.080 --> 08:58.131
It's a fucking shithole, any road.

08:58.235 --> 09:00.668
Yeah, well, it's our shithole.

09:00.772 --> 09:03.796
[music playing]

09:15.127 --> 09:18.811
Mom could get five years.

09:18.915 --> 09:19.749
Take a seat.

09:27.673 --> 09:29.864
Mm, get back with me.

09:29.968 --> 09:31.045
What?

09:31.150 --> 09:35.598
Get back with me, and I'll drop the charges.

09:35.702 --> 09:37.372
Gallant, isn't it? - It's over.

09:37.476 --> 09:38.414
It's now.

09:38.519 --> 09:39.422
You're being a prick.

09:46.408 --> 09:48.980
Look me in the eye and tell me you don't love me.

09:53.359 --> 09:56.244
And I love you, too.

09:56.349 --> 09:57.496
So sleep on it.

09:57.599 --> 10:00.103
[music playing]

10:04.030 --> 10:06.394
So fucking sorry about this mix up.

10:06.498 --> 10:07.402
Epic error.

10:07.506 --> 10:09.313
Basically, no rent's been registered

10:09.418 --> 10:11.468
on this place for six years, so the council

10:11.572 --> 10:13.519
just presumed it was empty.

10:13.622 --> 10:15.569
And then that, plus all the benefits you claim.

10:15.673 --> 10:19.531
Well, the left hand had no idea what the right hand was doing.

10:19.636 --> 10:21.339
So I'm just like, Josie, you gotta go around there

10:21.444 --> 10:22.554
and apologize.

10:22.659 --> 10:25.301
So here I am. So where is your mom?

10:25.405 --> 10:26.239
Work

10:26.344 --> 10:27.213
Holiday.

10:29.541 --> 10:32.599
She got a mobile?

10:32.703 --> 10:33.677
Yeah.

10:33.782 --> 10:37.709
It's 0929--

[thud]

10:38.856 --> 10:42.714
[music playing]

10:42.818 --> 10:45.564
[sighs] Mom went AWOL about three months ago.

10:45.668 --> 10:47.059
We don't know where she is.

10:47.163 --> 10:48.832
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:48.936 --> 10:51.438
It's been really difficult, especially

10:51.542 --> 10:53.176
for little Liam and Carl.

10:53.281 --> 10:54.705
Who looks after the kids?

10:54.810 --> 10:56.339
I do.

10:56.444 --> 10:58.981
Well, we all help, but mainly me.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.742
How old are you, sweetheart?

11:03.846 --> 11:04.923
I'm nearly 17.

11:05.028 --> 11:07.809
But since mom's gone, dad has been brilliant.

11:07.913 --> 11:09.199
[thud]

11:09.304 --> 11:11.597
For the last time, Debbie, will you keep your pisshead

11:11.701 --> 11:13.439
of a father out of my shop?

11:13.543 --> 11:16.429
I'm sick of finding him looking at porn and drinking Bailey's.

11:16.532 --> 11:17.368
Malibu.

11:20.148 --> 11:21.295
Who's this?

11:21.399 --> 11:23.032
Social.

11:23.137 --> 11:25.291
Oh!

11:25.396 --> 11:27.550
Oogie-boogie-boogie!

11:27.654 --> 11:32.208
Fucking chitty banging, child catching, [growls]

11:32.312 --> 11:36.761

11:36.865 --> 11:40.479
[music playing]

11:47.848 --> 11:49.969
How long you been married?

11:50.074 --> 11:53.514
Probably about as long as you've been alive.

11:53.618 --> 11:55.287
Why'd you do it?

11:55.392 --> 11:58.589
What sort of question is that?

11:58.693 --> 12:00.187
I don't know.

12:00.291 --> 12:03.489
I did it because it makes me feel wanted.

12:03.593 --> 12:05.436
That enough for you?

12:05.540 --> 12:06.409
Sounds fake.

12:11.448 --> 12:14.472
You're smarter than the other kids, you know that?

12:14.576 --> 12:16.801
What do you want to do with your life?

12:16.906 --> 12:19.443
Probably drive a cab, or something up.

12:19.547 --> 12:20.868
No.

12:20.972 --> 12:23.544
You've got your whole life to screw up before that.

12:23.648 --> 12:29.279
No, I see you more as a lawyer, or something.

12:29.383 --> 12:30.253
Or a porn star.

12:30.357 --> 12:32.824
[laughs]

12:32.929 --> 12:34.874
I love my husband.

12:34.979 --> 12:36.717
And I like sex.

12:36.821 --> 12:39.741
And that's all there is to this, right?

12:39.845 --> 12:42.209
[music playing]

13:02.299 --> 13:03.549
You know, I'm dead embarrassed about it

13:03.653 --> 13:05.391
by the way you saw me yesterday.

13:05.495 --> 13:08.484
Must've had some dodgy vol-au-vents, or something

13:08.589 --> 13:10.953
the night before, and eck-eck.

13:11.057 --> 13:14.151
I think I understand, Frank.

13:14.255 --> 13:15.089
Oh, good.

13:15.194 --> 13:16.548
So we're on the same page?

13:16.652 --> 13:18.252
Mm.

13:18.356 --> 13:19.225
Fried egg?

13:23.847 --> 13:25.793
How's it going?

13:25.898 --> 13:27.636
Fine.

13:27.740 --> 13:28.574
You?

13:33.370 --> 13:37.333
Is there somewhere you ca go for a drink around here?

13:37.437 --> 13:39.905
[music playing]

13:40.809 --> 13:42.894
I know what it's like.

13:42.999 --> 13:43.833
Do you?

13:43.937 --> 13:45.223
Yeah, I do.

13:45.328 --> 13:46.961
I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.

13:47.065 --> 13:49.881
And me oldest just gone to uni.

13:49.985 --> 13:51.062
You don't look a day over 30.

13:51.166 --> 13:52.313
Well, I'm 33.

13:52.417 --> 13:54.572
You do the maths.

13:54.676 --> 13:58.223
Joined the social to help families, not split them up.

13:58.326 --> 13:59.507
And this a good family.

13:59.612 --> 14:00.690
I can tell.

14:00.794 --> 14:01.802
Liam's great.

14:01.906 --> 14:03.922

So I'll jump some forms in.

14:36.143 --> 14:38.957

14:48.863 --> 14:50.913

Go home your kids, Frank.

26:14.687 --> 26:17.641
I'm not serving you.

26:17.745 --> 26:24.420
[blows a raspberry] OK.

26:24.524 --> 26:25.739
Off!

26:25.844 --> 26:27.200
Frank!

26:27.304 --> 26:29.251
She's told you more than once.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.058
Get thee behind me, Satan!

26:31.162 --> 26:32.969
[music playing]

26:33.073 --> 26:37.070
She won't serve me!

26:37.175 --> 26:37.905
Where is it?

26:38.009 --> 26:40.443
When did she get so choosy?

26:40.547 --> 26:42.561
Fucking WAG wannabe.

26:42.666 --> 26:44.091
Gangster's moll.

26:44.195 --> 26:47.219
He's not much of a fucking gangster, is he?

26:47.324 --> 26:51.495
Jumped up Michael flatulence Lord of the Ring beast,

26:51.598 --> 26:52.503
isn't he?

26:57.820 --> 27:00.427
Go on, take me dignity.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.025
Take it now.

27:02.130 --> 27:02.999
Take it!

27:03.104 --> 27:04.146
Take me kids!

27:04.251 --> 27:05.293
Bastards!

27:05.398 --> 27:09.881
Take me fucking kidneys, and all, go on!

27:09.985 --> 27:10.889
Ah!

27:10.993 --> 27:11.932
Agh!

27:12.036 --> 27:14.121
Two for one this week!

27:16.937 --> 27:21.247
I've always been right fucking there for my kids.

27:21.351 --> 27:23.193
What about me, eh?

27:23.298 --> 27:25.348
What I've been through.

27:25.452 --> 27:28.823
What is left?

27:28.927 --> 27:30.804
They've all gone.

27:30.909 --> 27:38.520
So what is left for me?

27:38.624 --> 27:41.441
[music playing]

27:43.942 --> 27:45.229
Right.

27:45.333 --> 27:46.583
OK.

27:46.688 --> 27:48.323
Well, they can keep Liam and Stella

27:48.427 --> 27:49.816
in custody for three days.

27:49.921 --> 27:51.416
And if they get a court order, they

27:51.519 --> 27:53.640
keep them for another eight.

27:53.744 --> 27:55.586
Can we see them?

27:55.690 --> 27:56.942
Supervised.

27:57.046 --> 27:58.610
But they can't call.

27:58.714 --> 27:59.896
But, I mean, Liam can't.

28:00.001 --> 28:01.043
And we can't call him.

28:01.148 --> 28:03.267
Bastards.

28:03.372 --> 28:05.874
It's my worst nightmare to be taken away.

28:05.979 --> 28:06.847
Yeah, Liam's strong.

28:06.952 --> 28:07.786
He'll be all right.

28:11.192 --> 28:13.834
What, is this her?

28:13.938 --> 28:15.085
I just came to say I'm sorry.

28:15.189 --> 28:16.336
Oh, how cute.

28:16.441 --> 28:18.561
Now she wants to say sorry.

28:18.665 --> 28:20.090
Why don't you fuck off and ease

28:20.194 --> 28:21.515
your conscience somewhere else?

28:21.619 --> 28:24.157
[music playing]

28:39.137 --> 28:40.040
[door closing]

28:43.690 --> 28:45.324
We take it slow.

28:45.428 --> 28:47.478
You get therapy.

28:47.582 --> 28:49.842
You stay in here.

28:49.946 --> 28:50.781
Come here.

29:03.570 --> 29:04.405
Give us a kiss.

29:12.572 --> 29:16.327
Even if you are going through with this for effect,

29:16.430 --> 29:23.660
just to get me to drop the charges, it's OK.

29:23.765 --> 29:26.719
All I want is another chance.

29:38.050 --> 29:41.213
[music playing]

29:43.749 --> 29:44.619
I'm sorry.

29:44.723 --> 29:47.712
[music playing]

29:57.514 --> 29:58.382
Yes, mate.

29:58.487 --> 29:59.494
Girls Allowed.

29:59.599 --> 30:01.719
[growls] I could fucking do them all over.

30:01.823 --> 30:02.901
Which one do you like the most?

30:03.005 --> 30:04.153
Hm?

30:04.257 --> 30:07.836
Oh, the-- the first song. - Not song.

30:07.941 --> 30:09.539
Which girl, you dick.

30:09.644 --> 30:11.694
You sound like a proper poof sometimes.

30:11.798 --> 30:12.841
Shut up!

30:12.945 --> 30:14.440
You used to wank off to Hanson, before you

30:14.544 --> 30:16.455
found out they were blokes! - Shut the fuck up about that!

30:16.560 --> 30:18.263
He did, didn't he? Didn't he?

30:18.368 --> 30:21.287
For fuck's sakes.

30:21.391 --> 30:24.207
How'd it go?

30:24.311 --> 30:25.215
Uh oh.

30:29.212 --> 30:31.228
I'm going to give him another go.

30:31.331 --> 30:32.584
For real.

30:32.688 --> 30:35.642
Oh, when did everything get so fucking fucked!

30:38.526 --> 30:40.126
Can we do this somewhere else?

30:40.230 --> 30:41.550
No!

30:41.655 --> 30:43.566
Because then everybody won't be able see how fucking stupid

30:43.670 --> 30:44.609
you're being!

30:44.713 --> 30:47.737
Would you stop humiliating me?

30:47.841 --> 30:48.745
Toilets, now.

30:48.849 --> 30:52.359
[music playing]

30:56.461 --> 30:57.296
[door opening and closing]

30:57.399 --> 30:59.311
How fucking dare you?

30:59.416 --> 31:01.293
You think this is easy for me? - No.

31:01.396 --> 31:02.544
I just think you lied to us!

31:02.648 --> 31:03.934
- Cool it, Mickey. - Ah, leave him be.

31:04.038 --> 31:05.255
You're the one who punched a hole in his head.

31:05.358 --> 31:07.652
That's a point well made.

31:07.758 --> 31:09.912
I want no midnight visits.

31:10.016 --> 31:12.310
no brotherly protection.

31:12.415 --> 31:14.535
If you do anything, then me and Katie'll leave.

31:14.639 --> 31:16.377
You got that?

31:16.481 --> 31:18.601
You got that?

31:18.706 --> 31:19.436
You're an idiot.

31:19.540 --> 31:21.555
And so are you, and you!

31:21.660 --> 31:25.136
Look, all the people who should be together are breaking up.

31:25.241 --> 31:27.638
And all the people who should be tied to fucking radiators

31:27.742 --> 31:29.237
to be kept apart are getting together.

31:29.341 --> 31:30.349
What have I done?

31:30.453 --> 31:32.991
Karen blatantly wants you back.

31:33.096 --> 31:36.084
And if you had half a bollock, you'd have leapt over that bar,

31:36.189 --> 31:37.300
and fucking claimed her.

31:37.404 --> 31:38.274
When I need moral advice from you--

31:38.378 --> 31:39.525
Well, don't take it, then.

31:39.630 --> 31:41.055
Let your marriage go down the shitter,

31:41.159 --> 31:42.584
if that's what you want.

31:42.688 --> 31:45.191
But remember to tell your face you're strong, silent,

31:45.295 --> 31:46.581
and happy to lose the only woman who's

31:46.685 --> 31:47.589
ever or ever will love you.

31:47.693 --> 31:48.701
You're going too far.

31:48.806 --> 31:49.917
Not far enough!

31:54.297 --> 31:59.962
And Mandy, if you get back with a cancerous turd,

32:00.066 --> 32:02.187
and I'll be the one fucking leaving.

32:04.619 --> 32:08.826
Too many Smarties before lunchtime.

32:08.930 --> 32:09.798
Takes after his mother.

32:19.322 --> 32:22.833
I didn't go there to give in, take him back.

32:25.926 --> 32:27.073
I need a mate, Karen.

32:30.897 --> 32:31.765
And I'm here.

32:35.379 --> 32:40.177
Get yourself sorted, come back down, yeah?

32:40.280 --> 32:41.566
God.

33:08.955 --> 33:12.361
What are you doing?

33:12.465 --> 33:13.333
You're my wife.

33:13.438 --> 33:15.280
I'm tired of being away from you.

33:15.385 --> 33:17.991
I'm going to fuck your brains out right now.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.173
[cheering]

33:21.120 --> 33:22.197
Go on, son!

33:27.167 --> 33:29.288
Does everyone have to watch?

Hello?

33:49.064 --> 33:51.846
Is anybody there?

34:03.593 --> 34:04.426
Hello?

How the hell is it--

[music playing]

34:14.228 --> 34:16.244
Hello?

Ah!

[thud]

34:18.329 --> 34:20.728
[dragging noise]

34:20.831 --> 34:21.770
Who are you?

34:21.875 --> 34:23.092
Where are you taking me?

34:23.195 --> 34:25.803
Outside.

34:25.907 --> 34:27.469
I call the police.

34:27.574 --> 34:31.710
I'm not going anywhere!

34:31.815 --> 34:32.684
Oh!

34:32.789 --> 34:33.726
All right!

34:33.831 --> 34:35.569
This is how it works, does it?

34:35.674 --> 34:39.775
A human being seeks sanctuary and you pummel him!

34:39.879 --> 34:42.764
You put me outside, and my next move is

34:42.868 --> 34:44.501
the bottom of the canal, mate.

34:44.606 --> 34:45.996
I swear to God!

34:49.541 --> 34:54.476
I just need someone's--

34:54.581 --> 34:55.937
someone to talk to.

34:56.042 --> 35:01.254
[sobs] Please.

35:03.861 --> 35:05.808
[footsteps]

35:08.414 --> 35:10.639
Lorna!

35:10.743 --> 35:13.732
You're not allergic to latex.

35:13.837 --> 35:15.783
Because if you were, you wouldn't have

35:15.887 --> 35:17.486
worn those washing up gloves.

35:17.590 --> 35:20.754
Which means you're not allergic to condoms.

35:20.858 --> 35:22.734
You want a baby, and Reggie can't.

35:22.839 --> 35:26.522
You got all that from washing up gloves?

35:26.628 --> 35:27.531
Thought you were smart.

35:27.635 --> 35:28.504
Doesn't he mind?

35:28.608 --> 35:29.546
He wants one, too.

35:29.651 --> 35:31.389
What about IVF or something?

35:31.493 --> 35:33.196
We tried.

35:33.300 --> 35:36.567
You get one free pop, and then it's 16 grand a go.

35:36.673 --> 35:37.680
Or adopt.

35:37.784 --> 35:38.723
Don't you think we've tried?

35:38.827 --> 35:39.835
Been on the list for years.

35:39.939 --> 35:41.468
Why us lot?

35:41.572 --> 35:43.345
Because if it happened, none of you lot would hang around.

35:43.449 --> 35:44.318
I might.

35:46.578 --> 35:49.184
I'm sorry I said what I said.

35:49.289 --> 35:50.296
Thank you.

35:52.973 --> 35:54.571
Ches?

35:54.676 --> 35:56.378
Do us a favor.

35:56.483 --> 35:58.117
Tell your mates not to come around anymore?

35:58.221 --> 35:59.160
Why?

35:59.264 --> 36:00.098
I'm pregnant.

36:03.399 --> 36:04.234
Wait!

36:04.338 --> 36:05.381
Who's is it?

36:05.485 --> 36:06.563
It's mine!

[loud bang]

36:21.786 --> 36:24.219
What is that smell?

36:24.323 --> 36:26.409
You puke on your shirt.

36:26.513 --> 36:27.382
Oh.

36:27.487 --> 36:41.320
[mumbles]

36:41.424 --> 36:44.621
What, do you think I want to make love to you?

36:44.726 --> 36:48.131
I don't want to make love to you.

36:48.236 --> 36:49.592
Sod it.

36:49.697 --> 36:53.937
A cock in the mouth would be the perfect nightcap to this fuck

36:54.041 --> 36:57.830
awful day.

36:57.934 --> 37:01.791
[sighs] Got anything to drink?

37:01.897 --> 37:03.112
What?

37:03.216 --> 37:05.824
You think just because I'm Polish, I drink?

37:05.928 --> 37:07.144
I work.

37:07.248 --> 37:08.082
OK.

37:13.296 --> 37:25.287
[laughs] [burps] Yeah.

37:25.391 --> 37:26.434
Na Zdorovie!

37:26.539 --> 37:27.234
Yeah.

37:27.338 --> 37:29.389
Up your kilts.

[music playing]

37:32.169 --> 37:39.260
[door opening and closing]

37:39.364 --> 37:41.067
How are you?

37:41.171 --> 37:44.821
Things are good, Joe.

37:44.924 --> 37:47.462
Mandy's given you another chance.

37:47.566 --> 37:49.409
Me and Jamie are back together.

37:49.513 --> 37:52.189
Stop this.

37:52.293 --> 37:55.247
What you going to do?

37:55.353 --> 37:57.715
Are you going to kill me?

37:57.821 --> 38:00.566
Is there a gun in your handbag.

38:00.671 --> 38:03.589
I just did Mandy in this bed.

38:03.694 --> 38:04.563
Do you, too.

38:04.667 --> 38:06.405
Complete the set.

38:06.509 --> 38:08.769
Like old times.

38:08.873 --> 38:12.801
[door opening and closing]

38:12.904 --> 38:15.997
How's your head?

38:16.101 --> 38:19.021
Hey.

38:19.125 --> 38:22.879
I don't know how you do it.

38:22.983 --> 38:24.513
You beat her up.

38:24.617 --> 38:27.746
And she still wants to come back to you

38:27.850 --> 38:30.004
But you're getting a second chance,

38:30.109 --> 38:35.601
so you count yourself the luckiest man alive for now.

38:35.705 --> 38:41.405
Because if my sister so much as stubs a toe in your presence,

38:41.509 --> 38:44.220
I'll cut off your head.

38:44.324 --> 38:45.993
I'll film it.

38:46.097 --> 38:50.858
I'll stick it on you YouTube, and I will hop,

38:50.963 --> 38:53.848
skip, and jump into prison.

38:58.053 --> 38:59.617
What are you two doing here?

38:59.723 --> 39:01.634
Came to give him something.

39:16.614 --> 39:18.143
Shane's pissed, isn't he?

39:23.877 --> 39:25.998
Did I miss a meeting?

39:26.102 --> 39:27.840
What are you doing here?

39:27.944 --> 39:29.439
Came to scare the bastard. [shotgun cocking]

39:29.543 --> 39:30.726
It's dealt with, Dad.

39:34.619 --> 39:35.903
Hello, boys.

39:39.796 --> 39:41.361
Chloral hydrate.

39:41.465 --> 39:42.612
Untraceable.

39:42.717 --> 39:43.898
Just let me stick it in the bastard!

39:44.002 --> 39:44.905
[shouting] - Come on!

39:45.010 --> 39:45.878
Get down

39:45.984 --> 39:47.895
What's the fucking point?

39:47.999 --> 39:49.042
Took a deep breath?

39:49.146 --> 39:52.587
[metal dinging on floor]

39:52.692 --> 39:53.526
No, no.

39:53.630 --> 39:54.776
I've got it.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.835
[music playing]

40:10.070 --> 40:11.009
Come on.

40:11.113 --> 40:12.016
Let's go get a pizza.

40:12.120 --> 40:15.318
[music playing]

40:28.803 --> 40:29.916
[door closing]

40:33.844 --> 40:39.891
You tell or threaten to tell that lot about what happened

40:39.995 --> 40:42.880
I'll just telling them you've been hitting Mandy,

40:42.985 --> 40:45.973
even if you haven't.

40:46.078 --> 40:47.260
Get it?

40:47.364 --> 40:51.882
That 40 grand you lent me?

40:51.987 --> 40:53.898
Mine.

40:54.002 --> 40:56.192
Right?

40:56.296 --> 40:57.166
Ah.

41:00.189 --> 41:02.380
Welcome back to the family.

41:02.484 --> 41:05.124
I'll just go and tell the nurse you just soiled yourself.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.307
Oh, God!

41:13.814 --> 41:16.665
And I have big feelings.

41:16.768 --> 41:19.862
And I am articulate about them.

41:19.966 --> 41:23.303
It's like there-- there is a stalactite

41:23.407 --> 41:28.934
that hangs hard and cold from my heart to the pit of my stomach.

41:29.038 --> 41:30.671
And I am cold inside, Frank.

41:30.775 --> 41:35.050
Oh, stop fucking moaning, will you?

41:35.155 --> 41:36.407
You're all lonely.

41:36.511 --> 41:37.344
I'm lonely.

41:37.449 --> 41:39.604
We're all fucking lonely!

41:39.707 --> 41:43.497
Frank, you don't know what real loneliness is.

41:43.601 --> 41:47.007
Oh, I'm don't?

41:47.111 --> 41:53.577
Today, the social took my kids away!

41:57.087 --> 42:00.840
And some random security guard is

42:00.944 --> 42:04.698
the only person in this whole world I've

42:04.802 --> 42:07.965
got to talk to you about it.

42:08.070 --> 42:11.441
Well, I would have, if I could a fucking word in edgeways.

42:14.083 --> 42:16.689
They took your children?

42:16.794 --> 42:17.663
Why?

42:26.039 --> 42:27.569
Can you get them back?

42:27.672 --> 42:32.608
[scoffs] What am I going to do?

42:32.713 --> 42:35.389
Sober up?

42:35.494 --> 42:38.864
Roll over and play Dad?

42:38.968 --> 42:46.927
I haven't got the fucking will.

42:47.033 --> 42:49.639
You live with your children?

42:49.743 --> 42:52.559
Then you don't know what loneliness is!

42:52.663 --> 42:57.460
I would give anything to have what you have, Frank!

42:57.565 --> 42:59.406
Well, what do I have?

43:02.326 --> 43:04.689
[speaking in polish], Frank!

43:04.793 --> 43:08.478
Well, what does that mean?

43:08.581 --> 43:10.945
It doesn't mean I love you, does it?

43:11.049 --> 43:12.475
Where are you going?

43:15.220 --> 43:16.055
For a shit.

43:18.523 --> 43:19.391
OK.

43:34.023 --> 43:34.892
It's all my fault.

43:34.997 --> 43:37.396
Oh, bollocks!

43:37.500 --> 43:42.401
I went out, had a good time, and now they're gone.

43:42.505 --> 43:47.961
And the worst thing is, is when I realized that they were gone,

43:48.065 --> 43:51.159
a part of me--

43:51.263 --> 43:54.357
a part of me was glad I didn't have to take care of them.

43:54.461 --> 43:58.840
[sobs] And now Liam can't even call us.

44:01.864 --> 44:05.201
He can't even call me to say how scared he must be!

44:07.912 --> 44:10.657
[sobs] Stella has no idea where she is!

44:10.762 --> 44:11.909
Debbie, I'm going in for a hug.

44:12.013 --> 44:13.300
And I don't care what you say.

44:13.404 --> 44:21.675
[sobs]

44:21.779 --> 44:23.205
One thing, though.

44:23.309 --> 44:25.568
If she was only doing it to get pregnant,

44:25.672 --> 44:28.002
why did she give Dougie a blow job?

44:28.106 --> 44:30.121
She let me do her up the ass, once.

44:33.667 --> 44:34.744
Don't judge, Huey.

44:34.848 --> 44:46.388
[laughs]

44:46.492 --> 44:47.673
Debbie, get up here!

44:47.777 --> 44:49.030
Ches, one minute.

44:49.134 --> 44:50.003
It's Liam!

44:50.107 --> 44:52.644
[music playing]

44:54.625 --> 44:55.737
It's Liam!

45:01.785 --> 45:02.653
Liam!

45:02.758 --> 45:04.704
Liam, are you OK?

45:04.809 --> 45:05.677
He's OK!

45:05.782 --> 45:08.527
Where are you?

45:08.631 --> 45:10.474
He's in Stockport.

45:10.578 --> 45:12.977
Oh, Liam, we miss you so much!

45:13.081 --> 45:14.055
Oh, look, everyone's here!

45:14.159 --> 45:14.992
Say hi!

45:15.098 --> 45:17.043
Liam!

45:17.148 --> 45:21.805
Don't look at me like that.

45:21.909 --> 45:24.968
At least, now you've all got a sporting chance.

45:27.610 --> 45:30.564
Not that you need it.

45:30.668 --> 45:38.627
You-- You all turned out just stunning.

45:44.050 --> 45:46.934
I always thought that you can't be mine.

45:49.854 --> 45:52.322
But then, you can't be your mom's either.

45:57.361 --> 45:58.891
And you're all leaving.

46:03.861 --> 46:04.904
Fiona?

46:05.008 --> 46:05.877
Lip?

46:08.518 --> 46:10.569
When the fuck do they come to visit.

46:10.673 --> 46:21.657
And before you know it, Ian, Carl, Debbie.

46:26.975 --> 46:28.087
And then what have I got?

46:37.748 --> 46:39.001
You're my life's work.

46:42.719 --> 46:43.832
My Sistine Chapel.

46:47.376 --> 46:49.914
You might have been better off without me,

46:50.018 --> 46:51.860
but I'm fucked without you.

46:57.178 --> 46:59.402
And there it was.

46:59.506 --> 47:01.592
That feeling.

47:01.696 --> 47:03.539
Neurons forming.

47:03.643 --> 47:05.797
Synapses firing.

47:05.902 --> 47:09.100
Brain chemistry kicking in.

47:09.204 --> 47:12.924
A decision being made like fucking granite.

47:13.028 --> 47:13.896
Stella!

47:18.242 --> 47:19.075
Liam!

47:24.393 --> 47:25.330
Stellaliam!

47:31.066 --> 47:35.272
[music playing]

48:13.227 --> 48:15.798
[buttons clicking]

48:17.397 --> 48:19.830
Oh, sh--

48:19.934 --> 48:22.332
Norma, please!

48:22.437 --> 48:23.966
It's 6:00 in the morning!

48:24.071 --> 48:26.017
Just-- just one more go.

48:26.122 --> 48:29.388
Fucking Fascists!

48:29.492 --> 48:33.003
