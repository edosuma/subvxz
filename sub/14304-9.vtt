There. What do you think?

00:51.919 --> 00:53.652
I love it!

00:53.654 --> 00:55.154
Me next, me next, me next!

00:55.156 --> 00:59.058
And make me look
exactly like Star.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.859
And I mean exactly.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.728
Fun sleepover,
huh, guys?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.530
Best sleepover ever!!

01:04.532 --> 01:07.900
And it's about to get
a lot better.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.334
( ticking, alarm rings )

01:09.336 --> 01:11.537
I never made
brownies before.

01:11.539 --> 01:14.106
I used real
magic sprinkles.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.008
ALL: Mmm!

01:16.010 --> 01:18.777
So good, right?

01:18.779 --> 01:20.746
Yes!

01:22.015 --> 01:23.715
Oh, so good.

01:23.717 --> 01:27.586
( jazzy piano music playing )

01:33.693 --> 01:35.094
Oh, hey, girls.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.762
I was just
practicing piano.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.430
It's jazz.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.099
Hi, Marco.

01:40.101 --> 01:42.434
Oh, I didn't know
you played, Marco. Yeah!

01:46.306 --> 01:49.141
Oh, hey, Jackie.
Didn't see you there.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.043
Whoa!

01:51.045 --> 01:52.744
Are you okay?

01:52.746 --> 01:54.813
Why don't you come and try
one of my brownies?

01:54.815 --> 01:59.251
Brownies? These days,
I'm sticking with
the protein shakes.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.386
It's what keeps
these bad boys happy.

02:01.388 --> 02:04.823
Oh, oh, uh-huh.
You got it bad.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.892
Bad? No.
( nervous laughter )

02:06.894 --> 02:08.260
( stammering )

02:08.262 --> 02:09.895
It's game time, Marco.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.431
And since you're so good
at playing the field,

02:12.433 --> 02:14.299
I got a game that
would be perfect for you.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.435
ALL: Wow!

02:16.437 --> 02:17.903
It's a box.

02:17.905 --> 02:21.907
It's called
Truth Or Punishment.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.675
It's all about
telling your friends

02:23.677 --> 02:26.078
your deepest,
darkest secrets.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.847
And I'm out.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.682
Give me one second.
Marco!

02:30.684 --> 02:32.985
Marco, Marco, Marco, Marco.

02:32.987 --> 02:35.087
Why don't you wanna play?

02:35.089 --> 02:37.656
I just think maybe
some things are better
kept secrets.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.091
What are you
talking about?

02:39.093 --> 02:41.627
Oh, Marco,
come play with us.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.762
Yeah, Marco.
Come share a secret.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.165
- He's coming.
- I hate you.

02:46.167 --> 02:49.868
Okay, you're supposed
to ask three questions,

02:49.870 --> 02:51.637
each one harder
than the last,

02:51.639 --> 02:53.505
and all we do
is answer them. So...

02:57.277 --> 03:00.679
Deceit and fables,
lies and fiction,

03:00.681 --> 03:02.614
even with
complete conviction.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.350
If truth is absent
from these events,

03:05.352 --> 03:08.353
all will face
the punishments.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.889
- What does that mean?
- It means if you lie to him,

03:10.891 --> 03:12.791
something bad'll
happen.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.893
Pledge an oath of truth.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.863
- Pinky swear to me.
- Okay.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.032
I promise to tell
the truth.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.134
- The truth.
- The truth.

03:22.136 --> 03:24.903
- The truth.
- The truth.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.872
The truth.

03:26.874 --> 03:30.342
It's time for
Truth Or Punishment.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.311
Pony, this is
already awesome.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.246
The first question:

03:43.156 --> 03:44.556
Uh, Pony?

03:44.558 --> 03:47.092
Oh, girl, maybe the first one
is very easy.

03:47.094 --> 03:48.827
The next one's probably
something interesting,

03:48.829 --> 03:50.729
like have you ever
killed a man.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.331
Mm, actually,
that's still easy.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.832
Pony Head,
favorite color?

03:53.834 --> 03:56.535
- Pony Head color. Done.
- What?

03:56.537 --> 03:58.170
It's a very popular
color on Mewni.

03:58.172 --> 04:00.939
Uh, Star, what's
your favorite color?

04:00.941 --> 04:03.875
Uh, I have to go
with yellow.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.344
( gasps )
Me, too.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.246
No way!

04:07.248 --> 04:09.681
( both giggling )

04:11.184 --> 04:14.253
- Jackie?
- Neon green.
How about you?

04:14.255 --> 04:15.954
Well, I like red.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.889
Blood red?

04:17.891 --> 04:21.627
Uh... no. Just like,
putty red.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.395
Well, I like black.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.930
I can see that.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.398
Oh, black is
my second favorite.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.966
Black is pretty cool.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.302
Someone is lying.

04:32.805 --> 04:36.041
( all laughing )

04:40.647 --> 04:42.881
One of us, speak up.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.049
Okay.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.218
I love pink.

04:46.220 --> 04:48.553
It's my favorite.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.589
- Truth.
- ALL: Pink?!

04:50.591 --> 04:52.991
I just hate contributing
to gender stereotypes.

04:52.993 --> 04:56.628
Janna likes pink
and fights the patriarchy.

05:04.003 --> 05:05.804
That was awesome!

05:05.806 --> 05:08.840
Yeah. It's, like,
we're inside the game.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.909
Second question.

05:15.915 --> 05:19.484
Easy. Everybody
loved my brownies.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.687
Okay, yeah, they were
very watchamacallit,

05:21.689 --> 05:24.856
- very good, right, guys?
- Yeah, they were great.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.326
Yep. Good brownies, Star.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.027
Actually, I didn't have
a brownie,

05:29.029 --> 05:30.929
so I guess
I missed out.

05:30.931 --> 05:35.300
Oh, that's too bad, Marco,
because they were really good.

05:35.302 --> 05:36.935
Jackie?

05:36.937 --> 05:39.438
Yeah. Delicious.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.307
- What?!
- What's happening to us?

05:42.309 --> 05:43.642
( whinnies )

05:43.644 --> 05:46.878
Someone is lying.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.882
And this is what lies
look like on the inside.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.217
( all screaming )

05:52.219 --> 05:54.219
Wait. Who didn't
like my brownies?

05:54.221 --> 05:55.887
I just... ha ha... uh...

05:55.889 --> 05:57.856
I told you, I didn't even
have a brownie.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.858
Somebody tell the truth.
Quick.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.827
Okay. Fine.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.295
Sorry, Star, I lied.

06:03.297 --> 06:05.897
Those were, like,
the worst brownies ever.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.900
- Huh?
- Poor Star.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.869
Okay, I lied, too.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.505
Those brownies
tasted like dirt.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.073
Okay, if I had a stomach,

06:15.075 --> 06:17.376
I would be very sick
inside of the stomach, okay?

06:17.378 --> 06:20.045
Well, I loved
her brownies.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.550
Okay, okay, I lied.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.619
The brownies
were horrible.

06:31.090 --> 06:32.758
Okay, I don't wanna
play this game anymore.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.927
Yeah. I'm sorry I brought
this stupid game now.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.929
Come on, let's go
to the Bounce Lounge.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.732
- Good idea.
- Let's get outta here.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.234
Nobody leaves

06:42.236 --> 06:45.437
until you answer
the final question.

06:50.276 --> 06:52.911
Okay, let's do
something else.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.913
Okay, guys, we can do this.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.348
Let's just answer
and end this.

06:56.350 --> 06:57.783
Go ahead, game.
We're ready.

06:57.785 --> 07:01.586
Who do you have
a crush on?

07:01.588 --> 07:04.222
Okay, this really cute guy
from skate camp last summer.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.390
He's really nice.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.793
ALL: Aww!

07:07.795 --> 07:09.895
See? That was easy.
Okay, now you go, Marco.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.530
No, thanks.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.031
I, uh, I'm good.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.966
It's Star's turn,
I'm sure.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.401
I say who goes next,

07:16.403 --> 07:19.771
and I say
Star goes next.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.374
Oscar Greeson.
Everybody knows that.

07:22.376 --> 07:23.775
Good choice.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.244
Star Fan 13,
your crush?

07:26.246 --> 07:29.047
Star Butterfly,
of course.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.148
Pony Head?

07:30.150 --> 07:31.817
If we're really
being honest here,

07:31.819 --> 07:33.785
and we're gonna be vulnerable,

07:33.787 --> 07:35.153
I guess I just have to
admit it and say,

07:35.155 --> 07:37.456
it's me.
I love myself.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.157
Go, Pony.

07:39.159 --> 07:43.428
Well, I think we all know
who I have a crush on.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.797
- Don't we, Marco?
- Uh...

07:45.799 --> 07:47.566
Eighteenth-century
poet John Keats.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.167
Ha ha.

07:49.169 --> 07:53.305
Okay, Marco Diaz.
Your crush.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.606
Oh, Marco, you don't
have to...

07:54.608 --> 07:57.509
No. It's... it's fine.

07:57.511 --> 08:00.445
Ugh. Okay.

08:00.447 --> 08:03.014
My crush...

08:03.016 --> 08:06.117
my crush is on Jackie.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.186
- Jackie Lynn Thomas.
- What?

08:08.188 --> 08:13.625
Somebody lied
big time!

08:13.627 --> 08:15.293
Who lied?!

08:15.295 --> 08:16.628
Janna, was it you again?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.263
No. It is John Keats.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.298
Mine is the cute guy
from skate camp.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.267
Ha ha. I love Star.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.369
And I love Oscar Greeson.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.004
Marco!

08:26.006 --> 08:28.807
I told you, I have
a crush on Jackie.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.108
At least,
I think I do.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.643
What does that really mean?

08:31.645 --> 08:33.712
I put her on
this sort of pedestal.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.647
So do I like the image
of her

08:35.649 --> 08:37.382
or who she really is?

08:37.384 --> 08:40.118
I mean, I like her enough
to know that she deserves

08:40.120 --> 08:42.354
someone who wants to get to know
her, which is definitely me.

08:44.156 --> 08:46.324
Wow!

08:46.326 --> 08:49.394
I always
get to the truth,

08:49.396 --> 08:51.029
but that...
kudos, really.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.699
But you weren't the one
who lied!!

08:57.837 --> 09:00.038
( evil laughter )

09:00.040 --> 09:02.440
Don't worry, guys.
I got this.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.180
Star!

09:09.182 --> 09:10.815
Marco!

09:12.018 --> 09:13.251
Jump!

09:33.105 --> 09:35.774
( evil laughter )

09:35.776 --> 09:37.909
Stop it! What did we do
to deserve this?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.945
Lies are a plague.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.680
- A virus.
- A weed.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.215
- And to stop a weed...
- You must kill the root.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.784
But it's not
really lying.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.119
Huh?

09:48.121 --> 09:51.122
Sometimes, you don't know
what you think.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.224
Your head
and your heart disagree.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.293
You think you know
how you feel about something,

09:55.295 --> 09:57.529
but then it changes.

09:57.531 --> 09:59.230
Pony, ask me
my favorite color.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.899
You already said it.
It's yellow.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.201
- Ask me again.
- What's your favorite color?

10:03.203 --> 10:05.437
Right now? Blue.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.105
Wait! Stop it!

10:07.107 --> 10:08.740
- You can't change...
- Your mind.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.442
Jackie, who do you
have a crush on?

10:10.444 --> 10:13.211
Uh... I don't...

10:13.213 --> 10:14.312
I don't know anymore.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.448
No!
( shrieking )

10:16.450 --> 10:18.783
You think that everything
is black and white,

10:18.785 --> 10:19.884
and you can't.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.086
Stop!

10:21.088 --> 10:23.154
It's a bunch of
different colors

10:23.156 --> 10:26.124
A rainbow of feelings
that's always changing.

10:33.833 --> 10:37.235
STAR: Thanks for coming
to my sleepover.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.837
Thanks, Star.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.439
- Crazy night, huh?
- Yeah. Crazy.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.842
See ya at school,
Marco.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.479
Bye, ladies.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.781
Uh, hey.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.183
What say we get
our Sunday morning
breakfast burritos?

10:52.185 --> 10:54.586
Nah. Not today, Star.

10:54.588 --> 10:57.455
I'm gonna go catch up
on some Z's.

10:57.457 --> 11:01.326
My room's that way.
( giggles )

11:01.328 --> 11:02.761
Marco?

11:04.196 --> 11:06.097
Marco Diaz!

11:06.099 --> 11:10.602
Truth. Star Butterfly
has a crush on...

11:15.374 --> 11:18.176
Thanks for meeting us
here today, Rasticore.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.279
We have a problem with
some rogue princesses,

11:21.281 --> 11:22.447
which I hope
you can help us with.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.716
( growling )

11:29.188 --> 11:31.523
Destroy the blonde one,

11:31.525 --> 11:34.292
but bring the dark-haired
one to me.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.301
( stammering )

11:43.303 --> 11:45.403
Gimme a break.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.408
- Do you--
- Working on it.

11:56.982 --> 11:58.717
Oh, Miss Heinous,

11:58.719 --> 12:01.319
I cannot wait to recapture
our former glory.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.222
It has been a long time
since I last ate.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.424
- ( stomach rumbling )
- Indeed.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.059
Here. Take this.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.061
The last of our savings.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.497
Oh, you're so generous,
Miss Heinous.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.333
Finally, some little food
for my mouth.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.435
It's not for food,
you fool.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.270
It's for my hair.

12:19.272 --> 12:22.273
Miss Fairol's number 112.
Golden brown.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.242
And bring back a receipt!

12:24.244 --> 12:26.044
( laughing )

12:26.046 --> 12:29.114
"Billie's Ballet Shoe
Emporium.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.382
Our discounts are
on pointe"?

12:31.384 --> 12:34.385
Marco, why do you
even have this?

12:34.387 --> 12:36.454
For your information,

12:36.456 --> 12:39.357
they are incredibly
comfortable to wear
around the house.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.793
What are you guys doing
looking through my wallet
anyway?

12:41.795 --> 12:44.129
Can't a guy get
any privacy?

12:44.131 --> 12:46.264
- Nope.
- Hey, what's with
this weird card?

12:46.266 --> 12:47.799
It's all shaky.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.567
Let me see that.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.437
Hey, this is the Quest Buy
gift card I got for you, Marco.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.773
I can't believe
you haven't used it yet.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.642
I got this for our six-month
friendship-aversary

12:57.644 --> 12:59.444
so you could get yourself
something special.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.379
If you don't use it,
it'll expire.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.582
Look, Star, it's not that
I don't appreciate it, okay?

13:04.584 --> 13:08.486
It's just that the last time
I went to Quest Buy,
I almost got killed.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.322
But, Marco,
it expires tonight.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.291
Come on!

13:13.293 --> 13:14.659
( whimpers )

13:14.661 --> 13:17.662
( sighs )
Fine. Let's go.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.397
Yay. Perfect!

13:19.399 --> 13:21.733
- Back in a bit, Janna.
- Laters.

13:21.735 --> 13:24.536
All right, let's get you
the perfect gift!

13:25.671 --> 13:27.172
Oh, no.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.673
See anything you like?

13:28.675 --> 13:31.176
Look. There's
a Skullaroid camera.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.144
Takes pictures
specifically of ghosts.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.979
Uh, I don't think so.

13:34.981 --> 13:38.416
Oh, how about some spooky
haunted garden gnomes?

13:38.418 --> 13:39.784
Look at all this stuff.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.486
This is exactly why
I do not like shopping.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.987
I can never
make up my mind.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.789
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.125
Easy there,
Mr. Picky Pants.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.427
Luckily, we got
until midnight.

14:01.707 --> 14:06.010
Tell me where Princess Star
and Princess Marco are located.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.513
Uh, loud.
They went to Quest Buy.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.982
The one near
the galactic vortex,

14:10.984 --> 14:12.717
or the one with
the big parking lot?

14:12.719 --> 14:14.786
( growling )

14:15.988 --> 14:18.556
Never mind.
I found them.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.529
Come on.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.806
Why did you even ask
if you already knew?

14:34.808 --> 14:37.909
Ooh, that is getting
a little too close for comfort.

14:37.911 --> 14:40.478
Marco, I don't mean
to rush you,

14:40.480 --> 14:42.347
but it's been hours.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.815
If you don't find
something soon,

14:43.817 --> 14:46.351
the card will expire
and go to waste.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.386
You know it's hard for me
to shop in public.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.356
Plus I'm just not that into
Quest Buy gear.

14:51.358 --> 14:54.559
Ugh, Marco!

14:54.561 --> 14:57.929
They have literally
everything in the universe here.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.865
There has to be something
you want.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.700
Please!!

15:02.702 --> 15:04.602
Hurry up!!

15:04.604 --> 15:06.271
If you're going
to rush me,

15:06.273 --> 15:08.339
then I'll just buy
some piece of junk now,

15:08.341 --> 15:10.909
and come back to exchange
it later, okay?

15:15.714 --> 15:17.282
What the heck?!

15:17.284 --> 15:19.684
( laughing )
Oh, yeah. That.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.519
I may have forgotten
to mention that this is

15:21.521 --> 15:23.855
a "friends to the end"
gift card.

15:23.857 --> 15:26.524
You have to truly, deeply
want the item you spend it on,

15:26.526 --> 15:28.293
or else it won't work.

15:28.295 --> 15:31.529
Star, why would you give me
a card like that?

15:31.531 --> 15:34.799
Because I wanted to get you
something you really liked.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.268
Okay. Fine.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.104
Just, uh, nothing
in this section.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.206
Good, 'cause I don't
like you either.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.442
I see why
you're on sale.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.777
All right, all right.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.545
- Ugh!
- How about this?

15:47.547 --> 15:48.780
No, no. Too gaudy.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.315
How about one of these?

15:50.317 --> 15:51.649
Another keychain?
I'll pass.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.418
How about one of these?

15:53.420 --> 15:55.219
Uh, maybe. Nah.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.621
How about this?

15:56.623 --> 15:59.624
Star, you know the neck
is gonna stretch out on that.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.426
Ow! All right, all right!

16:01.428 --> 16:04.595
I'm sorry, but I really
can't decide under
this kind of pressure.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.297
Maybe we can get
an extension on the card.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.498
Well, we can try.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.434
Excuse me.
I have a question.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.569
- Not my department.
- But you're customer service.

16:13.172 --> 16:14.839
Oh, yeah.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.574
We really need
to ditch that sign.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.576
Fine. How can I help you?

16:18.578 --> 16:21.179
Is there any way we can
extend the expiration date
on this card?

16:21.181 --> 16:22.647
- Shouldn't be a problem.
- ( beeps )

16:22.649 --> 16:24.482
Uh, you know what?

16:24.484 --> 16:27.518
No. This is a "friends
to the end" gift card.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.687
It's not only impervious
to change,

16:29.689 --> 16:32.991
- but when it expires,
so do you.
- What?!

16:32.993 --> 16:34.625
Like, we die?

16:34.627 --> 16:38.596
Geez. Everyone's gotta die
some time.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.332
This just guarantees
that you'll die sooner.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.268
It's all here in
the contract your friend signed.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.771
If you don't use it
by midnight, zap, ha ha.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.173
Both of you get blasted
into oblivion.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.942
Zap?!
Tell me again, Star.

16:50.944 --> 16:53.177
Why did you get me
a card like this?

16:53.179 --> 16:55.546
I didn't know.
I never read the fine print.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.515
Always read
the fine print, Star.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.783
I mean, look at
this contract.

16:59.985 --> 17:01.786
There's gotta be
something we can do.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.621
Nope. Sorry, dude.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.656
Um, dudes.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.625
Seeing as there's
only a few hours left,

17:07.627 --> 17:09.794
you better go find
something you really like.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.062
( both screaming )

17:22.007 --> 17:25.309
Uh, yes, before you ask,
this is not my...

17:26.745 --> 17:29.647
- Oh, no. Ten minutes
to midnight.
- We're toast.

17:32.918 --> 17:34.719
Activating expiration mode.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.288
Shooting star explosion!

17:38.824 --> 17:41.359
Enough nonsense.
Choose your gift.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.227
Your life
depends on it.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.663
Commencing countdown
to your expiration date.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.632
You have ten minutes.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.601
- See anything
you like, Marco?
- No.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.570
Nine minutes
until expiration.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.572
- What about
gourmet hair gel?
- No

17:54.574 --> 17:57.108
8.5 minutes until
expiration.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.010
Who designed this card?!

17:59.012 --> 18:00.611
Why do you have
to be so picky?

18:00.613 --> 18:02.013
I'm not picky.

18:02.015 --> 18:04.549
I'm just...
highly selective.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.785
Wait, Star.
Hold on.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.354
The ultimate in privacy.

18:10.356 --> 18:12.723
It's even my favorite color.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.693
And a thumbprint
privacy setting.
( laughs )

18:15.695 --> 18:17.462
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.729
It's yours, Marco.

18:18.731 --> 18:19.897
Get it, get it,
get it out.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.732
( straining )
It's stuck.

18:21.734 --> 18:25.403
- Sorry, sir.
That's a display model.
- ( screaming )

18:25.405 --> 18:27.605
We gotta get
the Quest Buy
sloth employee to help us.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.340
( laughing )

18:31.210 --> 18:33.277
Stand back.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.446
My friend Marco needs
one of your privacy wallets.

18:35.448 --> 18:39.550
Uh, well, I am on my break,

18:39.552 --> 18:41.619
but, sure, let me check.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.321
Can you see if
they have it in plum?

18:43.323 --> 18:46.324
Uh, sorry. Looks like
we're out of stock.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.726
No. It can't be.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.828
One minute
to expiration.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.064
This is all my fault.

18:53.066 --> 18:55.666
I should've let you know
there was an expiration date.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.803
And I wasn't being lazy
when I bought that thing,
I promise.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.272
I genuinely thought you would
love to pick out

19:01.274 --> 19:02.840
what you wanted.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.676
Sorry. Did you mean
jeans pig unwanted?

19:05.678 --> 19:07.778
I know a lot of this
wouldn't have happened

19:07.780 --> 19:09.313
if I was easier
to shop for.

19:09.315 --> 19:12.617
Okay, I will search for
cheesier mop store.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.185
Let's hug,

19:14.187 --> 19:16.487
so when they find
our charred skeletons,

19:16.489 --> 19:18.422
they'll know
we were friends.

19:18.424 --> 19:22.827
Sorry. There was zero results
for snow made worm pants.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.762
Wait! I know what I want!

19:24.764 --> 19:27.698
Hey, there's only one thing
in this whole stinkin' store

19:27.700 --> 19:30.368
that I could ever want.
Star's my best friend,

19:30.370 --> 19:34.438
and friendship is the greatest
gift I could ever receive.

19:36.041 --> 19:39.677
You need to pick something
you can purchase from the store.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.779
Well, it was
worth a shot.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.182
- It was sweet, Marco.
- Preparing to honor
expiration.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.883
Good-bye, Marco.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.552
Good-bye, Star.

19:49.721 --> 19:51.822
( angry muttering )

19:51.824 --> 19:53.391
Where are the stairs
in this place?

19:55.727 --> 20:00.731
Princesses, my name is
Rasticore Chaosus Disastorvayne.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.900
Miss Heinous sent me.

20:05.871 --> 20:09.340
Invalid entry.
Expiration imminent.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.542
Hold it. We do have

20:11.544 --> 20:13.878
one more privacy wallet
in stock.

20:13.880 --> 20:17.181
- ( both exclaim )
- Only, sorry.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.350
We don't have it in plum.

20:19.352 --> 20:22.186
Just, we have it in, um,
Prussian blue.

20:22.188 --> 20:26.557
( sobbing )

20:26.559 --> 20:28.826
Oh, it's perfect.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.695
Prussian blue
is my favorite color.

20:30.697 --> 20:31.862
Even more than plum.

20:31.864 --> 20:35.600
Sheesh. So dramatic.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.768
Good doing business
with you, sir.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.837
Contract obligation
fulfilled.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.075
( beeps )

20:44.077 --> 20:46.544
( explosion )

20:46.546 --> 20:49.547
Well, that completes
your transaction.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.716
Have a good day, sir.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.384
We got you
the perfect friendship gift!

20:53.386 --> 20:56.053
What is with this thing?

20:56.055 --> 20:57.955
How the heck are you
even supposed to open this?

20:57.957 --> 20:59.290
Let me see that.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.726
Nice try, ladies.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.861
Its thumbprint lock
will allow no man or
magical creature to ever--

21:03.863 --> 21:05.696
Got it.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.798
Janna, get out of town!

21:07.800 --> 21:10.201
- How did you do that, Janna?
- I've got Marco's thumbprint.

21:10.203 --> 21:13.638
In fact, I've got all of your
sensitive information, Marco.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.273
Get outta town!!

21:16.441 --> 21:19.877
Delivery from
Quest Buy, milady.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.813
But I wouldn't open it.
