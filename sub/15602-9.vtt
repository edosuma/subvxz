<b>1x09 - In Love and War</b>

00:22.502 --> 00:23.931
<i>Previously in Green Lantern...</i>

00:24.601 --> 00:27.636
I'll pick you up
after work. I promise.

00:27.704 --> 00:31.640
Maybe we'll be back in time for
your date with Carol after all.

00:31.708 --> 00:34.543
Dinner will have to wait.
We're here now.

00:34.611 --> 00:37.480
We fight them.
We stop them.

00:37.481 --> 00:40.481
<i> <font color="lime"> sync & correction by Aakrithi Gosh

00:44.371 --> 00:47.440
Is that all it takes
to stop a Green Lantern... 

00:47.507 --> 00:49.775
a broken heart?

00:51.111 --> 00:53.479
You want to talk about it,
Sir Mopes-a-lot?

00:53.547 --> 00:56.883
No.
I miss Galia, ok?

00:56.950 --> 00:58.718
Hey, I know.
You're not the only one

00:58.785 --> 01:01.053
who left someone they care about.

01:01.121 --> 01:04.156
You need something to take your
mind off this emotional stuff.

01:04.224 --> 01:08.728
Sensors indicate an entity
8,000 meters off the starboard bow.

01:08.795 --> 01:10.696
Contact in 20 seconds.

01:10.764 --> 01:13.099
Thank you, Aya. That's
exactly what I'm talking about.

01:13.166 --> 01:16.202
So, Kilowog, you're in charge.
What's your move?

01:16.270 --> 01:19.572
Look, Jordan, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

01:19.640 --> 01:22.108
but I'm just not up for this.

01:24.678 --> 01:27.213
What the heck?

01:30.150 --> 01:33.085
- That's a real monster.
- I did give ample warning.

01:33.153 --> 01:35.655
I thought you were
playing along. Let's go, guys.

01:51.104 --> 01:52.972
Aya, shock that thing off the...

02:24.972 --> 02:27.807
How many lantern colors
are there?

02:27.874 --> 02:30.543
So you're, what, Pink Lanterns?

02:30.610 --> 02:32.545
Not precisely, Green Lantern.

02:32.612 --> 02:34.547
Where you value willpower,

02:34.614 --> 02:39.118
the Star Sapphires channel the power
and serve the cause of love.

02:53.233 --> 02:55.167
Thanks for the assist.

02:55.235 --> 02:57.236
How do you happen to be
in this neck of the woods?

02:57.304 --> 02:59.105
This sector of space is ours.

02:59.172 --> 03:02.408
But pardon my manners.
I am Aga'po.

03:02.476 --> 03:05.311
This is my niece, Ghia'ta.

03:05.379 --> 03:08.214
You're mighty handy
with those power rings.

03:08.281 --> 03:11.083
We sure could use your help
fighting the Red Lantern corps.

03:11.151 --> 03:14.153
I would enjoy allying
myself with you, Hal Jordan.

03:15.222 --> 03:16.856
We are close to our home planet.

03:16.923 --> 03:20.059
Perhaps you'd accompany us
for rest and repair

03:20.127 --> 03:21.694
before you resume your mission?

03:22.062 --> 03:24.663
I don't mind if I do.

03:38.779 --> 03:41.213
I'd rather not talk about it.

03:42.582 --> 03:46.652
You suffer from a great loss.
A broken heart.

04:25.525 --> 04:27.760
Razer, you sure
you don't want to come out?

04:27.828 --> 04:29.295
They're throwing us a party.

04:29.362 --> 04:32.631
How delightful for you.
I'll pass.

04:32.699 --> 04:35.901
Not a people person yet,
but we're working on him.

04:38.505 --> 04:41.107
Aga'po, you weren't surprised
when you saw us.

04:41.174 --> 04:43.242
How do you know about
the Green Lanterns?

04:43.310 --> 04:47.179
Long ago, we were of one race
with your masters.

04:47.247 --> 04:51.317
You and the guardians?
Thanks for putting that in my head.

04:51.384 --> 04:53.652
And usually, hot girls
don't go for the nerds.

04:53.720 --> 04:57.690
It was long ago.
We took very different paths.

04:57.757 --> 05:01.560
They refused to allow any emotion
to influence their judgment.

05:01.628 --> 05:04.830
We found this insufferable
and foolish.

05:04.898 --> 05:06.999
Sounds like our guardians, all right.

05:09.703 --> 05:13.372
My people believe that only
love can save the universe.

05:13.440 --> 05:17.910
Love fuels our rings.
Its power is unfathomable.

05:21.781 --> 05:24.550
<i>Hail, Queen Aga'po.</i>

05:28.555 --> 05:30.890
We will celebrate
with a feast this evening.

05:30.957 --> 05:35.161
Ghia'ta, entertain them
until then, yes?

05:35.228 --> 05:37.730
So, not that I'm complaining,

05:37.797 --> 05:40.833
but are we going to be
the only men folk at this party?

05:40.901 --> 05:44.737
We of Zamaron have found that
life is more peaceful and loving

05:44.804 --> 05:46.906
when women are in charge.

05:46.973 --> 05:49.241
I don't know.
I've had some female bosses

05:49.309 --> 05:50.709
who could be a real pain in the...

05:50.777 --> 05:52.645
We have some time
before the feast, Hal Jordan.

05:52.712 --> 05:55.314
May I show you some sights?

06:10.096 --> 06:14.900
Well, Hal Jordan? Is it not
the most wondrous of places?

06:14.968 --> 06:16.602
Yes.

06:16.670 --> 06:19.972
Uh, but let's not be late
for the banquet.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.975
We shouldn't keep your aunt,
the Queen, waiting.

06:35.655 --> 06:38.857
Galia?
Is it really you?

06:38.925 --> 06:41.260
Hello, my love.

06:41.328 --> 06:42.795
What are you doing here?

06:42.862 --> 06:45.464
And in one of them
Star Sapphire outfits?

06:45.532 --> 06:46.966
Don't you like it?

06:47.033 --> 06:50.302
Baby, you'd look good
in a gorlian sand sack.

06:50.370 --> 06:53.472
But I don't understand.
How is this possible?

06:53.540 --> 06:55.474
- How did you...
- Hush.

06:55.542 --> 06:57.643
I have something to show you,

06:57.711 --> 07:02.314
something to keep our love
alive and thriving forever.

07:08.455 --> 07:10.789
Repairs from the attack
are complete,

07:10.857 --> 07:13.325
but Green Lantern Kilowog
is not responding.

07:13.393 --> 07:17.129
- His energy level has gone flat.
- He's dead?

07:17.197 --> 07:20.499
No. He seems to be
in stasis.

07:20.567 --> 07:25.138
I knew this planet was going to
be more trouble than it was worth.

07:26.206 --> 07:27.673
<i>Interceptor to Hal Jordan.</i>

07:27.741 --> 07:30.843
<i>Kilowog's not answering hails.
Is he with you?</i>

07:30.910 --> 07:35.414
Kilowog's a big boy, Razer.
I'm sure he's fine.

07:47.656 --> 07:49.256
What is taking so long?

07:49.324 --> 07:52.092
These Lanterns can help us
much more than ordinary males.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.194
The Bolovaxian came willingly.

07:54.262 --> 07:56.330
The earthling should be
as easily persuaded.

07:56.398 --> 08:00.701
<i>My Queen, Hal Jordan is different
from any other male I've met.</i>

08:00.769 --> 08:04.204
<i>I've never felt like this,
never experienced the...</i>

08:04.272 --> 08:07.374
Remember who is supposed to
fall in love with whom, Ghia'ta.

08:07.442 --> 08:10.878
Take stronger actions, or I will.

08:21.856 --> 08:24.091
Delicious.
What is it?

08:24.159 --> 08:26.627
The juice of the Kavleen fruit.

08:26.695 --> 08:30.898
It's said to replenish the
spirit and enhance the senses.

08:30.966 --> 08:34.068
This is my favorite place
in the palace.

08:34.135 --> 08:36.804
- Is the view not wonderful?
- Yes.

08:36.871 --> 08:40.640
It's... romantic, don't you think?

08:40.708 --> 08:43.510
Very.

08:52.354 --> 08:56.190
Of course.
He already has a true love.

08:56.257 --> 08:58.959
How else could he resist Ghia'ta?

09:23.685 --> 09:25.552
<i>Miss Farris,
we've done everything possible.</i>

09:25.620 --> 09:28.455
<i>We've turned over every rock,
followed every lead.</i>

09:28.523 --> 09:30.090
<i>There's no trace of Hal Jordan.</i>

09:30.158 --> 09:31.358
What are you saying?

09:31.426 --> 09:33.093
<i>At this point, we'd advise you</i>

09:33.161 --> 09:36.430
<i>to terminate your search
and move on.</i>

09:36.498 --> 09:37.998
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

09:38.066 --> 09:41.669
Thank you for your efforts.

09:48.176 --> 09:51.345
<i>Carol Farris of Earth,</i>

09:51.413 --> 09:53.814
<i>you have lost your true love.</i>

09:53.882 --> 09:57.851
<i>The Star Sapphires offer
to make your heart whole again,</i>

09:57.919 --> 10:01.855
<i>to reunite you,
to make you one of our own.</i>

10:03.992 --> 10:07.461
I don't wish to harm you,
but know that I will.

10:07.529 --> 10:09.963
- Now, stand aside.
- Stop.

10:10.031 --> 10:11.632
This is an honored guest,

10:11.700 --> 10:15.235
one of the heroes who rescued me
so valiantly today.

10:15.303 --> 10:18.839
Now, tell me,
what's bothering you?

10:18.907 --> 10:22.509
What have you done to Kilowog?
Where is he?

10:22.577 --> 10:24.912
I do not know where he is
at the moment,

10:24.979 --> 10:27.247
but I am certain he has come
to no harm.

10:27.315 --> 10:31.118
Come. We'll find
your comrade together.

10:31.186 --> 10:33.587
Kilowog's life force signal
is nearby,

10:33.655 --> 10:36.223
but his vital signs are too weak
for me to pinpoint.

10:36.291 --> 10:38.258
Robot, you are not welcome.

10:38.326 --> 10:39.993
But I must. I am...

10:40.061 --> 10:42.863
We have no use
for emotionless machines.

10:42.931 --> 10:45.165
Your presence is tolerated
on my planet

10:45.233 --> 10:47.668
only because of
the heroes you serve.

10:47.736 --> 10:49.737
Wait here, Aya.

10:52.907 --> 10:55.409
I will conduct my own search.

11:00.615 --> 11:03.517
I wonder how Kilowog's doing.
Maybe we should look for him.

11:03.585 --> 11:05.552
You seem tense, Hal Jordan.

11:05.620 --> 11:08.388
Look, you shouldn't...
Ahh. Ha.

11:08.456 --> 11:11.225
That does feel pretty good.

11:11.292 --> 11:14.995
Ah. Let's... let's give him a few
more minutes to turn up on his own.

11:15.063 --> 11:19.900
And you should really stop that.
In 4 or 5 hours.

11:34.816 --> 11:37.651
Razer, I must speak with you immediately.

12:07.015 --> 12:08.582
Stop!

12:47.922 --> 12:51.191
What a shock.
Kilowog's not here, either.

12:51.259 --> 12:54.161
Worry not.
We'll find him.

12:54.229 --> 12:59.666
I always get what I want.
I am the Queen.

13:02.303 --> 13:06.206
Razer,
they have imprisoned Kilowog.

13:11.312 --> 13:14.548
Let me get you a refill,
Hal Jordan.

13:27.662 --> 13:31.331
- Green Lantern?
- Carol?

13:31.399 --> 13:33.634
The ring said
it'd take me to my love, but...

13:33.701 --> 13:39.106
It's you.
You're Hal.

13:39.173 --> 13:41.174
Oh, Hal. Oh.

13:41.242 --> 13:43.911
I can't believe I was
ever fooled by this stupid mask.

13:43.978 --> 13:46.113
Carol, I don't understand.

13:46.180 --> 13:48.982
How... how can you be here?
How on...

13:49.050 --> 13:51.051
I thought you were dead. I...

13:51.119 --> 13:54.721
Oh, Hal, I thought
I'd never see you again.

13:56.791 --> 13:59.426
I see I've interrupted something.

13:59.494 --> 14:01.995
No, no. Carol, I...

14:06.801 --> 14:09.436
All this time,
I thought you were dead.

14:09.504 --> 14:11.872
Well, now you're going
to wish you were dead.

14:17.048 --> 14:20.017
You've got it all wrong, baby.
She's just a friend. 

14:21.119 --> 14:24.721
Don't worry, sister. I won't
forget your part in this.

14:24.789 --> 14:27.191
You're suffering delirium
from the transformation.

14:27.258 --> 14:29.393
We Star Sapphires are
beings of love.

14:29.460 --> 14:32.329
Carol, stop.
I don't know how you got here,

14:32.397 --> 14:35.232
or into that outfit, which you
look great in, by the way, but...

14:35.300 --> 14:38.869
Oh, I do, because your little
tramp here is in the same outfit.

14:38.937 --> 14:41.371
You've got to shake this off.
Whatever they've done to you...

14:41.439 --> 14:43.807
What they did is give me power.

14:47.245 --> 14:48.846
You let me think you were dead.

14:48.913 --> 14:52.349
And all the while, it was just
party time for old Hal, wasn't it?

14:52.417 --> 14:55.319
First of all, nothing happened
between me and Ghia'ta.

14:55.386 --> 14:59.356
And second, this is nuts.
Let's just talk.

14:59.424 --> 15:01.592
You want to talk?
Talk to the hand.

15:03.127 --> 15:06.096
Do not believe
the soulless automaton.

15:06.164 --> 15:10.100
I have ample reason
to trust her over any of you.

15:10.168 --> 15:12.636
Guards, take them.

15:29.687 --> 15:32.422
- Let me go!
- I won't.

15:32.490 --> 15:35.325
Letting go of you the first time
was the hardest thing I've ever done.

15:35.393 --> 15:39.096
- You're lying again!
- Carol...

15:41.132 --> 15:42.633
If that's what you think...

16:07.325 --> 16:08.959
Hal?

16:09.027 --> 16:11.962
What's going on?
Where on Earth are we?

16:12.030 --> 16:15.632
We're not on Earth, Carol.
It may sound crazy,

16:15.700 --> 16:18.101
but we're on the other side
of the galaxy

16:18.169 --> 16:20.203
on the front lines of a war.

16:20.271 --> 16:23.240
If my friends and I can't stop
this Red Lantern invasion,

16:23.308 --> 16:25.842
we lose everything.

16:25.910 --> 16:29.346
And that's why I'm out here
and not with you.

16:29.414 --> 16:33.250
Hal, I don't understand
all of this.

16:33.318 --> 16:36.386
But if Earth needs someone
fighting for us out here,

16:36.454 --> 16:39.656
they couldn't have chosen a braver
or more resourceful champion.

16:39.724 --> 16:41.825
Handsome.
You forgot handsome.

16:41.893 --> 16:43.327
Carol Farris,

16:43.394 --> 16:46.296
you can keep him here
safe from harm,

16:46.364 --> 16:47.931
safe from the war.

16:47.999 --> 16:50.867
The power of your love
can hold him here.

16:50.935 --> 16:53.937
Oh, honey, that's not love.
That's selfishness.

16:54.005 --> 16:55.939
Real love is sacrifice,

16:56.007 --> 16:57.741
putting another's needs
before your own,

16:57.809 --> 17:02.746
doing what's best
for the person you love. Here.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.214
You can have this ring back.

17:04.281 --> 17:06.450
Pink's not really my color.

17:06.517 --> 17:08.318
Though I will miss the boots.

17:08.386 --> 17:13.423
But... no one has ever rejected
the Star Sapphire power ring.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.858
No one has ever had
the strength.

17:15.926 --> 17:18.194
You look pretty strong to me.

17:18.262 --> 17:21.365
You shame me,
Carol Farris of Earth.

17:21.432 --> 17:24.768
I did not truly
understand love until now.

17:24.836 --> 17:27.537
You will be returned
to your home planet.

17:31.275 --> 17:32.309
Carol, I...

17:32.377 --> 17:35.712
Do whatever you have to do,
then come home to me.

17:52.530 --> 17:55.065
<i>Green Lantern Hal, you are needed.</i>

17:59.937 --> 18:02.272
Just where Aya said he'd be.

18:08.379 --> 18:11.214
Galia.

18:11.282 --> 18:13.150
Oh. You.

18:13.217 --> 18:16.153
What'd you do that for?
I was so happy!

18:16.220 --> 18:20.023
Yeah, I'm the bad guy for not
letting you stay a lawn ornament.

18:20.091 --> 18:22.893
Snap out of it, sergeant.
We have a war to fight.

18:40.178 --> 18:42.746
You will surrender Kilowog, witch.

18:42.814 --> 18:48.118
Child, your friend is happy,
like you soon will be.

18:48.186 --> 18:52.456
Aga'po, please listen.
We must release the men.

18:52.523 --> 18:56.326
We've been laboring under an
imperfect understanding of love.

18:56.394 --> 18:58.295
Earthling Carol Farris
rejected the ring

18:58.362 --> 19:00.764
and put her love's needs
ahead of her own.

19:00.832 --> 19:03.366
- That is true...
- Silence!

19:03.434 --> 19:05.368
Men spread war.

19:05.436 --> 19:08.238
The Star Sapphires bring
the gift of love.

19:08.306 --> 19:11.975
The galaxy will know peace only
when all men have been gentled

19:12.043 --> 19:14.277
by love's violet light.

19:22.336 --> 19:24.871
<i>So, you did have a true love.</i>

19:26.574 --> 19:28.508
<i>One who died...</i>

19:28.576 --> 19:32.279
<i>but whose form lives again.</i>

19:32.346 --> 19:34.414
In this robot.

19:36.358 --> 19:40.353
It's true. You.
You were in my mind.

19:40.421 --> 19:43.923
You stole the image of Alanna
from my memories.

19:43.991 --> 19:45.525
I meant no harm.

19:45.593 --> 19:47.093
I simply based
my mechanical form

19:47.161 --> 19:49.362
on the last imprint I had
in my database.

19:49.430 --> 19:52.565
Enough talk.
This Red Lantern is dead inside.

19:52.633 --> 19:56.703
He has nothing to fuel us.
It is a mercy to destroy him.

19:59.874 --> 20:01.808
By the way,
is that a "no" on the whole

20:01.876 --> 20:05.245
teaming up against the threat
to the galaxy question?

20:11.952 --> 20:14.521
Summon the Cephalon!

20:40.197 --> 20:43.633
Go, Hal Jordan.
Go while you can.

20:44.835 --> 20:46.703
I owe you one.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.311
- Galia?
- Kilowog, we have to leave.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.814
Galia!

21:13.264 --> 21:17.867
I am disappointed in you, Ghia'ta.
You have much to learn.

21:18.185 --> 21:21.954
No, my Queen.

21:22.022 --> 21:24.157
I have much to teach.

21:26.958 --> 21:29.958
