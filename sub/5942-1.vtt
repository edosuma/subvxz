<i>X! Yo, X!</i>

01:43.703 --> 01:46.069
Hey, man, stop playin' around.

01:46.139 --> 01:48.130
For real, man.
You skatin' or what?

01:48.208 --> 01:50.836

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.974
South Side!

01:57.050 --> 02:00.645
<i>Attention, all you wallflowers... </i>

02:00.720 --> 02:02.654
and all you seat warmers.

This is D.J. Smooth Dee talking...

02:05.625 --> 02:08.116
telling you, get on the floor...

02:08.193 --> 02:10.627
and skate till
you can't skate anymore.

02:10.697 --> 02:15.634
'Cause after today, the Garden
will be closing its doors indefinitely.

02:15.702 --> 02:18.330
And if you don't know
what "indefinitely" means...

02:18.404 --> 02:20.838
<i>you shouldn't be</i>
<i>in here skating anyway. </i>

02:20.907 --> 02:24.274
<i>You should have your ass</i>
<i>in summer school. </i>

02:24.344 --> 02:27.507
<i>I say it with love, people. </i>
<i>I say it with love. </i>

02:27.580 --> 02:30.105
So get up out your seat.

02:30.183 --> 02:33.550
We'll turn this mother-sucker out.

02:33.620 --> 02:38.580
All-skate, people.
This is an all-skate.

03:35.148 --> 03:39.585
Watch out, girl!

03:56.369 --> 04:00.465
Come on, Junior.

04:00.540 --> 04:03.373
Here we go. Here we go.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.934
All right, fellas. Let's form
this train, y'all. Come on. Come on.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.640
Whooooo!

04:08.715 --> 04:13.345
Whoo! Whoo!

04:14.921 --> 04:17.446
The boys is doin' it!

04:17.523 --> 04:20.890
<i>Them little boys is bad!</i>

04:24.364 --> 04:26.298
Whoo!

04:26.366 --> 04:28.527
Ooh!

04:30.570 --> 04:33.266
Boy, hit my butt again
and see what happens!

04:33.339 --> 04:36.172
Ooh! Ooh!

04:36.242 --> 04:38.870
Ooh! Y'all make me sick.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.436
Whoo!

04:45.885 --> 04:49.719
<i>Dang!</i>
<i>There goes our summer. </i>

04:49.789 --> 04:53.520
For real. I mean, y'all,
this is jacked up.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.729
Damn, Naps.
I know you ain't cryin'.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.668
No. My eyes just water
like this sometimes.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.932
- I have a condition.
- You ain't got no condition.

05:07.006 --> 05:09.907
Only condition you need to have
is some for that hair.

05:13.946 --> 05:16.574
Man, we can't keep nothin'
open in the hood.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.550
How much of them dumb mothers
gonna go broke all of a sudden?

05:19.619 --> 05:22.645
Shoot, Negro, you'll go broke too
if you had 15 kids.

05:22.722 --> 05:25.885
- Sixteen.
- Fifteen, 16, 36, whatever.

05:25.958 --> 05:28.893
That Negro got a whole football
<i>and</i> a basketball team.

05:28.961 --> 05:31.259
Blue 42!

05:31.331 --> 05:35.131
- <i>Yeah, but I wonder</i>
<i>what they're gonna build there. </i>
- <i>Come on now, X.</i>

05:35.201 --> 05:37.260
You know what they're
gonna build there.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.101
Same thing they always build.
Either a gun shop-

05:40.173 --> 05:42.141
- Barbecue shack.
- Chicken spot.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.938
- Liquor store.
- Or all four in one.

05:45.011 --> 05:49.209
<i>I hope they build that chicken spot. </i>
<i>Ooh, that'd be nice. </i>

05:49.282 --> 05:52.774
I guess we gotta go over
to Sweetwater to skate now.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.786
Mike, you're stupid.

05:54.854 --> 05:58.585
Look, I'm not goin' all the way
over to no North Side to go skate.

05:58.658 --> 06:02.492
Why not, X? You're afraid you can't
compete with those North Side boys, huh?

06:02.562 --> 06:05.497
- Mm-hmm.
- Who said I was afraid?

06:05.565 --> 06:08.466
Look, bottom line is
I don't wanna go over there.

06:08.534 --> 06:12.197
X just doesn't wanna run into that ug mug
he took to the movies last time.

06:12.271 --> 06:16.435
- Yep. Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Naomi? Naomi the duck.

06:16.509 --> 06:19.239
- Chick's so ugly, every time
you see her, you gotta duck.
- Duck!

06:19.312 --> 06:21.246
Watch out. Quack.

06:21.314 --> 06:24.078
Hey, I heard Sweetwater has
some nice-looking girls though.

06:24.150 --> 06:27.244
- For white girls.
- So? My mom's white, Junior.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.084
It's cool. She got a black woman's body,
so it don't count.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.090
<i>She good. </i>
<i>She cool. Mm-hmm. </i>

06:32.158 --> 06:35.025
No! Didn't I tell you to keep my mom's
name out your mouth? Huh?

06:35.094 --> 06:37.187
Man, get back on your bike, man!

06:37.263 --> 06:40.255
She's got a apple shape.
I look sometimes.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.858
- Hey, I say we go up there.
- Listen, Boo, all right?

06:42.935 --> 06:47.269
I'm not- Hey!

06:47.340 --> 06:49.331
Look at his wheel!

06:49.409 --> 06:52.640
Man, I told you to stop rollin' around
on those Buster Brown Goodwill skates.

06:52.712 --> 06:54.646
- Didn't I say that?
- Uh-huh. Sure, you're right.

06:54.714 --> 06:57.478
For real, X, man. It's time
to chuck them bad boys.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.814
Hey, my mom bought me
these skates, okay?

07:01.954 --> 07:05.720
Your mom bought 'em for you, and we
can't even talk about your old-ass skates.

07:05.792 --> 07:09.193
Man, Harriet Tubman wore them skates.
She skated her way to freedom.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.400
Look, man, these are not old.

07:14.467 --> 07:17.095
They're classics.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.731
Yeah, you know,
like your mama's hairdo.

07:20.807 --> 07:23.298
- Whoa!
- <i>He got you!</i>

07:23.376 --> 07:25.810
She still singin'
with the Supremes, right?

07:25.878 --> 07:28.711
Bald <i>and</i> beautiful.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.418
Oh, snap! Later.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.478
Oh, shoot. Junior, sorry.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.532
Yes!

07:51.571 --> 07:56.440
I made it. I made it.

07:56.509 --> 08:00.104
Daddy! X is late again!

08:00.179 --> 08:03.046
Girl, shh! Oh, girl, you better
not let me catch you. Come here!

08:03.115 --> 08:05.948
<i> Xavier!</i>

08:06.018 --> 08:09.784
- Huh?
- <i>Boy, get your butt out here!</i>

08:11.491 --> 08:13.425
Man, I hate her.

08:27.006 --> 08:30.032
You're pushin' it, son.

08:30.109 --> 08:32.407
Really pushin' it.

08:33.645 --> 08:36.513
What, Dad?
I beat the light.

08:36.582 --> 08:40.518
<i>Did I say anything</i>
<i>about a streetlight, Xavier?</i>

08:40.586 --> 08:46.081
I asked you to be home early so we can get
these gutters cleaned out, didn't I?

08:46.158 --> 08:48.991
- Oh, yeah.
- <i>"Oh, yeah. "</i>

08:49.061 --> 08:50.961
Boy, this ain't
a Kool-Aid commercial.

08:51.030 --> 08:54.090
Dad, the Gardens
closed down today for good.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.760
- I had to be there.
- <i>No, son. </i>

08:56.836 --> 08:59.964
You had to be here.
Okay? Here.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.973
<i>Now, look,</i>
<i>I know it's summertime. </i>

09:04.043 --> 09:06.443
You wanna be runnin' the streets
with the Mod Squad...

09:06.512 --> 09:09.003
but I'm gonna need
your help around here.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.846
It's just us now, son.

09:14.620 --> 09:18.579
<i>I'm gonna need you to step up. </i>
<i>You understand what I'm sayin' to you, son?</i>

09:20.626 --> 09:22.617
Yes, sir.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.590
<i> Xavier!</i>

10:34.734 --> 10:38.568
<i>Xavier! Come on, now. Let's go. </i>
<i>Trash day. What? Did you forget?</i>

10:38.638 --> 10:43.507
Oh, shoot! The trash!

10:46.012 --> 10:50.346
- Ahh.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Don't try to move 'em now.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.748
You know we don't like backtracking.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.184
Yeah, we're highly
opposed to backtracking.

10:55.254 --> 10:58.690
My fault. Look, I'll just bring 'em out
at night next time.

10:58.758 --> 11:02.250
Bring 'em out at night? No, you ain't gonna
just bring 'em out at night next time.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.764
What, so the German shepherd
and the pit bull puppies could
snatch the bag outta there...

11:05.831 --> 11:07.924
and have empty diapers
and cigarette wrappers...

11:08.000 --> 11:11.401
and Snickers wrappers and Stayfree boxes
laid all out in the middle of the street?

11:11.470 --> 11:16.237
Yeah. Then the neighbors call in
down to the plant complainin'.

11:16.308 --> 11:19.744
- <i>Right. </i>
- Talkin' about how we
didn't do our job correctly.

11:19.812 --> 11:22.781
And then we get complaints
and warnings from our boss.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.975
- <i>Then after the warning comes a demerit. </i>
- Right.

11:25.051 --> 11:29.579
And when you get to three demerits,
you know what happens then?

11:29.655 --> 11:32.453
- A nigger lose his job!
- Oh, God, man.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.619
- His house! His family!
- <i>Yeah. </i>

11:35.695 --> 11:39.631
<i>Get kicked out of church 'cause you no</i>
<i>longer got money for the collection plate. </i>

11:39.699 --> 11:42.259
- They want you out.
- Right.

11:42.334 --> 11:45.360
- <i>All because you bringin' out the garbage late. </i>
- <i>That's right. </i>

11:45.438 --> 11:48.407
<i>And I'm tellin' you straight up,</i>
<i>man, if I lose my job, man... </i>

11:48.474 --> 11:52.535
you're gonna put on a little Evel Knievel suit
and sell some dimes and nicks on a Big Wheel.

11:52.611 --> 11:54.977
You're gonna get my money
some kinda way!

11:55.047 --> 11:59.177
<i>Yeah. Then, 'cause of our rock-hard bodies</i>
<i>we developed from liftin' trash</i>-

11:59.251 --> 12:00.616
Right.

12:00.686 --> 12:03.246
- We end up in the alley as prostitutes.
- <i>Right. </i>

12:03.322 --> 12:04.983
Righ-

12:05.057 --> 12:07.855
- Yeah, that's right! You too!
- I don't know about all that.

12:07.927 --> 12:12.193
<i>Yeah, it could happen. You end up</i>
<i>in the alley with the shirt off, sweaty. </i>

12:12.264 --> 12:14.357
- <i>Sellin'.</i>
- <i>Right. </i>

12:14.433 --> 12:18.164
Not for money! Just for a bite
off the man's hamburger.

12:18.237 --> 12:22.435
<i>The point is we tryin' to make: Don't mess</i>
<i>with the Department of Sanitation... </i>

12:22.508 --> 12:25.966
or you will come up dirty!

12:33.919 --> 12:36.820
Hey! Hey, hey.

12:40.192 --> 12:42.786
Good God!
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.994
<i> Duncan Hines!</i>

12:49.301 --> 12:52.202
<i>Mmm! Look at her. </i>
<i>Skin just glitterin'.</i>

12:52.271 --> 12:55.502
Oh, yeah.

12:55.574 --> 12:59.010
Whoo! Boy!

12:59.078 --> 13:01.444
<i>Lord have mercy!</i>

13:01.514 --> 13:04.540
<i>Is that a Lustrasilk?</i>
<i>Look at how her hair blows. </i>

13:06.118 --> 13:08.143
<i>Look at her!</i>
<i>Look at the walk!</i>

13:08.220 --> 13:10.245
Chocolate city.
Chocolate city.

13:10.322 --> 13:13.985
That must be jelly, 'cause
jam don't shake like that.

13:14.059 --> 13:17.222
Yeah, I'm outta here.
See ya later, little man.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.924
Hey, lookit here.
Why don't you check your package.

13:19.999 --> 13:23.730
- You got a little fruit hangin' out of the loom.
- Huh?

13:23.803 --> 13:27.102
- Oh, man.
- Daddy, can we please go to McDonald's?

13:27.173 --> 13:30.939
No, honey. It's too early now.
I gotta go to work. Come-

13:33.279 --> 13:37.113
- Where are your clothes?
- Um, Dad-

13:37.183 --> 13:41.586
Never mind. I'm takin' your sister to Pam's
house to play, and then I gotta go to work.

13:43.355 --> 13:46.290
Dad, shouldn't you comb her hair first?

13:46.358 --> 13:50.385
I did comb it.

13:50.462 --> 13:53.363
Looks good.

13:53.432 --> 13:56.299
<i>In the car, honey. </i>

13:56.368 --> 14:00.168
Anyway, I'm outta here.
Don't burn down my house.

14:00.239 --> 14:04.699
And put some clothes on, boy. This ain't
Africa. What's the matter with you?

14:06.912 --> 14:11.144
Hey, Curt! What's up, baby?
Mr. Astronomical Man!

14:11.217 --> 14:13.208
Hey, Byron, Victor.

14:13.285 --> 14:16.152
Boy, you know I wanna be
just like you when I grow up.

14:16.222 --> 14:19.555
Wear the jeans with the whole sweater
tucked down in the pants.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.388
Oh, boy.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.987
No, man, all jokes aside, man, how the
airplane engineering business treatin' you?

14:25.064 --> 14:27.123
Never better, brother.
Never better.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.032
"Never better, brother.
Never better. "

14:30.102 --> 14:32.730
Cool it, man.
Curtis Uncle Tom, man.

14:32.805 --> 14:36.104
Damn! So what you think about me,
man, if you think he's Uncle Tom?

14:36.175 --> 14:38.109
He ain't down with the struggle
like you and me.

14:38.177 --> 14:40.111
- That dude voted for Nixon.
- <i>You're right about that. </i>

14:42.882 --> 14:45.373
Can I take a message?

14:45.451 --> 14:48.784
Sure. You can try back in about an hour.
All right. Thank you.

14:48.854 --> 14:50.788
Yes. Good morning. Hi.

14:50.856 --> 14:53.984
Good morning. I'm Curtis Smith. I'm here
to apply for the engineering position.

14:54.059 --> 14:57.460
I'm sorry, but that position
has already been filled. Sorry.

14:57.529 --> 15:01.625
<i>Good morning. McGill and White. </i>
<i>How may I help you?</i>

Hey! How you doin'? All right.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.113
Ahh!

Whoo!

15:21.052 --> 15:24.488
Hey, man!

15:24.556 --> 15:27.354
Hey, how you doin',

All right, here he comes.
Arm yourselves.

Oh!

Hey! Hey, come on, man! Stop it!

Stop playin'!

Little punks!

16:21.079 --> 16:24.048
Oh, sh-

16:24.115 --> 16:28.074
Whew.

16:36.161 --> 16:39.562
It's 97 degrees on the South Side.

16:39.631 --> 16:41.895
Hey, Mr. Walker.

16:54.312 --> 16:57.145

- Oh, man.

17:04.321 --> 17:06.551
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:06.624 --> 17:08.683
- All right. I just wanted to-
- Yeah, I'm cool.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.785
- I wanted to make sure.
- Just breaking in some skates.

17:10.862 --> 17:14.593
Tori. My mom and I
just moved in over there.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.896
Oh, okay. I'm X.

17:16.968 --> 17:20.404
Oh, okay. I think I seen your mom
take out the trash last week.

17:20.472 --> 17:24.965
Mm, black woman, skintight jeans,
wearin' a top with no bra on?

17:25.042 --> 17:28.501
- Uh, look, I don't-
- Yeah, that was her.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.413
She know she be workin' it.

17:31.483 --> 17:35.442
So, man, I see you skatin'.
Um, you a skater?

17:35.520 --> 17:39.081
Yeah, I- My daddy sent these for me.

17:39.157 --> 17:42.092
He lives in Atlanta
with his new wife- a white woman.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.687
But I ain't mad. Shoot, she's rich.

17:45.764 --> 17:48.255
What about you?

17:48.333 --> 17:50.927
<i>Do you have any brothers or sisters?</i>

17:51.002 --> 17:54.165
Well, yeah, I have a little sister.
She's five goin' on 40.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.799
And then there's my dad.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.400
Well, no comment.

18:00.812 --> 18:02.780
What about the people here?

18:02.847 --> 18:06.180
- What about 'em?
- <i>You know. They all nice like you?</i>

18:06.251 --> 18:09.618
Yeah, of course.
I mean, this is a nice city.

18:09.687 --> 18:12.679
- They're all nice like me.
- <i>Oh, really?</i>

18:12.757 --> 18:15.351
<i>Yeah. Better yet,</i>
<i>I'm gonna prove it to you. </i>

18:15.427 --> 18:18.157
- Hey, guys, this is Tori.
- Hi.

18:18.229 --> 18:21.027
Damn!

18:21.099 --> 18:24.034
Dang, girl! Did a whole silverware drawer
explode in your mouth?

18:26.538 --> 18:30.372
I'm just sayin', Amtrak called. They said
they need some of their tracks back.

18:30.442 --> 18:34.242
Lay me some tracks. Come on.

18:34.312 --> 18:37.509
Look, don't trip on him, all right?
He's always like this.

18:37.582 --> 18:39.914
Oh, don't worry. I'm not.

18:39.984 --> 18:42.976
I know punk rides
on the short yellow bus.

18:43.054 --> 18:45.921
- Ooh!
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:45.990 --> 18:48.891
Heavy metal? I know
you don't wanna start.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.724
- Yeah, you don't wanna start.
- Because I ain't the one.

18:51.796 --> 18:54.424
- He ain't the one.
- See, look at you.

18:54.499 --> 18:58.265
Your mouth look like a daggone
tin foil factory! That's what it look like.

18:58.336 --> 19:02.705
Well, at least I'm gettin' my teeth corrected.

19:02.774 --> 19:04.935
- <i>Look at yours. </i>
- What?

19:05.009 --> 19:08.501
You need to stop chewin'
on them yellow crayons...

19:08.580 --> 19:11.242
<i>and start scrubbin' with</i>
<i>some Colgate, yuck mouth!</i>

19:11.316 --> 19:14.114
She called you yuck mouth!

19:14.185 --> 19:17.621
What?

19:17.689 --> 19:20.453
See, that ain't fair.
You can't say "yuck mouth. "

19:20.525 --> 19:23.517
Because I'm allergic
to toothpaste anyway.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.688
And I was eatin' Cheetos.

19:25.763 --> 19:27.890
Look, look, forget you.
All right? I got you.

19:27.966 --> 19:30.298
I got somethin' for you.
Why you laugh at that, man?

19:30.368 --> 19:33.303
- 'Cause it's funny, yuck mouth.
- <i>Yo, X.</i>

19:33.371 --> 19:37.432
We're goin' over to Sweetwater to check it out
and maybe even get a glimpse at Sweetness.

19:37.509 --> 19:41.411
- What's a Sweetness?
- Only the baddest mo-fo
to ever slap on a pair of skates.

19:41.479 --> 19:43.572
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, best on the North Side.

19:43.648 --> 19:45.616
- I mean, not over here.
- Man, whatever.

19:45.683 --> 19:48.709
He wins the skate-off
every year. Dude is good.

19:48.786 --> 19:52.153
<i>Hey, I heard he had his own</i>
<i>theme music, like on</i> Baretta.

19:52.223 --> 19:54.783
- He ain't got no theme music.
- And I heard that one time...

19:54.859 --> 19:57.794
some fool challenged Sweetness
in the middle of the rink to a skate-off.

19:57.862 --> 20:00.797
He made homeboy look so bad
that he went number two on himself.

20:00.865 --> 20:02.833
- Stop jivin', man. You're lyin'.
- Man, I swear.

20:02.901 --> 20:05.461
Number two in white jeans.
He boo-booed on himself.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.562
- Nasty.
- <i>So, X, man, you comin' or what?</i>

20:07.639 --> 20:10.972
Guys, how come we just can't skate
over here like we been doin'?

20:11.042 --> 20:13.533
X, stop bein' a little punk, man.

20:13.611 --> 20:16.774
Look, we'll have you home
before the streetlight come on, all right?

20:16.848 --> 20:18.782
- Yeah.
- Look, my boy's comin'.

20:18.850 --> 20:21.250
Cool. I'm comin' too.

20:21.319 --> 20:23.412
Oh, he-he-hell, no.

20:23.488 --> 20:25.786
Junior, man, come on!

20:25.857 --> 20:29.293
- Can you even skate?
- Yeah.

20:29.360 --> 20:32.921
Yeah? Just don't fall on your face.
It's already hurt enough.

20:32.997 --> 20:35.966
Boy, don't touch my face.

20:36.034 --> 20:39.902
Hey, y'all, be quiet. Shh.
A moment of silence for her face, please.

20:39.971 --> 20:42.303
All right. Amen.
Hallelujah. Let's go.

20:42.373 --> 20:45.365
<i>That's messed up, yuck mouth. </i>

20:56.521 --> 20:58.489
Let's do this.

20:58.556 --> 21:01.423
- Oh, I'm telling you!
- Hey, man, we're gonna have
a good time at Sweetwater.

21:01.492 --> 21:04.859
I promise, man. Look at this.
My goodness! Whoo!

21:09.267 --> 21:14.364
Hey, see that right there? They got video games.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.554
Can I get your name?
Excuse me! Your number?

21:30.622 --> 21:33.420
Dang, this place is live.
I could live up in here.

21:33.491 --> 21:35.425
- Me too.
- For real.

21:35.493 --> 21:38.929
I didn't expect all of... this.

21:38.997 --> 21:41.261
<i>What was that?</i>

21:41.332 --> 21:43.596
- I don't know.
- Was that a girl or a guy?

21:43.668 --> 21:46.933
- Why you do that?
- Hey, man, this place has everything.

21:47.005 --> 21:49.838
- Yeah.
- Yeah, everything...

21:49.907 --> 21:51.966
but some real music.

21:52.043 --> 21:54.273
Okay, I mean,
the Gardens used to bump.

21:54.345 --> 21:58.042
- Yeah, that's true.
- <i>What? Boy, this is a jam. </i>

22:04.889 --> 22:07.756
She's crazy.

22:07.825 --> 22:09.759
"Emotion" by the Bee Gees!

22:09.827 --> 22:12.261
The Bee whats?

22:12.330 --> 22:15.231
Come on! Y'all never
heard of the Bee Gees?

22:15.299 --> 22:18.632
No. But it sound like somethin'
my cousin caught from his girlfriend.

22:18.703 --> 22:20.637
I heard it make your balls fall off.

22:20.705 --> 22:22.639
- Fo- For real?
- Yeah, so watch out.

22:22.707 --> 22:25.574
- Yo! Check this out!
- What?

22:25.643 --> 22:30.103
Whoo! Ha! Now this
is what I'm talkin' about.

22:30.181 --> 22:33.776
"Come compete
in this year's skate-off.

22:33.851 --> 22:36.115
<i>"Show your talents in group</i>
<i>roller dancing competition. </i>

22:36.187 --> 22:37.882
Grand prize $500!"

22:37.955 --> 22:41.254
You know what I could buy with $500?

22:41.325 --> 22:45.125
Hopefully a comb, Naps.

22:45.196 --> 22:48.893
Well, guys, I'm good.
I've seen enough.

22:48.966 --> 22:52.197
- What?
- X, we just got here, man.
What are you talkin' about?

22:52.270 --> 22:54.670
<i>For real, man. </i>
<i>Why are you actin' all funky?</i>

22:54.739 --> 22:57.071
- Man, I'm not actin' all funky.
- <i>You are too. </i>

22:57.141 --> 23:00.235
Plus there's way too much new booty
for us to be jaw-jacking with you.

23:00.311 --> 23:03.212
- For real. I'm rentin' skates.
- I'm with you, Naps.

23:03.281 --> 23:05.841
- Come on. Come on.
- <i> Let's pick up the pace... </i>

23:05.917 --> 23:08.909
<i>and groove to the sound</i>
<i>of the real thing. </i>

23:08.986 --> 23:11.250
<i>"Can You Feel the Force. "</i>

23:11.322 --> 23:13.984
Excuse me?

23:15.193 --> 23:17.127
Excuse me?

23:17.195 --> 23:18.924
Excuse me!

23:18.996 --> 23:20.930
Excuse me.

23:20.998 --> 23:23.091
Excuse me.

23:23.167 --> 23:26.967
Y'all need somethin'?

23:27.038 --> 23:30.804
- Nine.
- Right, nine. Right.

23:38.549 --> 23:42.280
No, man. These are 12's.
I asked for nines.

23:42.353 --> 23:45.220
Oh, my fault, little man.

23:48.726 --> 23:51.627
Well? Could you go get 'em?

23:51.696 --> 23:54.893
Hey, man, I can't be wearin'
these big old boats.

23:54.966 --> 23:57.230
- You know-
- Check this out, young blood.

23:57.301 --> 24:00.930
You're gonna wear whatever
skates Bernard gives you.

24:01.005 --> 24:03.735
Dig that?

24:03.808 --> 24:07.073
Don't start nothin'.
Won't be nothin'.

24:09.080 --> 24:13.244
We cool? Be cool.

24:14.719 --> 24:16.653
<i>Oh, baby, you're so smart. </i>

24:16.721 --> 24:18.916
- <i> Don't forget fine. </i>
- That dude was crazy!

24:18.990 --> 24:21.254
<i>Really. </i>
<i>Look like Jimi Hendrix. </i>

24:21.325 --> 24:23.589
- Oh, damn!
- What? What?

24:23.661 --> 24:25.652
<i>Diablo</i> mama!

24:25.730 --> 24:28.494
- <i>Damn!</i>
- <i> Ooh!</i>

24:28.566 --> 24:30.761
<i>"Love to Love You. "I do. </i>

25:13.110 --> 25:17.274
Be cool. She comin'. Don't look.

25:17.348 --> 25:20.613
Hey, baby.

25:22.520 --> 25:25.751
- Hi, Xavier.
- What?

25:25.823 --> 25:28.621
- Naomi?
- Yes.

25:28.693 --> 25:31.127
How are you?

25:31.195 --> 25:33.993
Oh, I-I'm fine.

25:34.065 --> 25:36.499
- <i>So when did you start comin' here?</i>
- Is that the duck?

25:36.567 --> 25:40.128
- <i>Oh, well, this is the first time down here. </i>
- Damn!

25:40.204 --> 25:42.138
See, the Gardens
got closed down, so-

25:42.206 --> 25:45.004
They closed the Gardens?
I didn't know that.

25:45.076 --> 25:47.476
Hmm.

25:47.545 --> 25:49.979
Like it.

25:50.047 --> 25:52.811
Um, are these your friends?

25:52.884 --> 25:56.945
Yeah. Uh, this is Mike,
Boo, Junior, Naps...

25:57.021 --> 25:59.080
and, uh, that's Tori.

25:59.156 --> 26:01.488
- Hi.
- Can't call it. Can't call it.

26:01.559 --> 26:04.357
- Hi. How's it-
- Shh.

26:04.428 --> 26:06.362
- What?
- You're messin' it up!

26:06.430 --> 26:09.763
Those lips hit my neck.

26:11.335 --> 26:13.701
You look great.

26:13.771 --> 26:15.636
Yeah, so do you.

26:15.706 --> 26:18.675
He ain't lyin'.
He ain't lyin'.

26:18.743 --> 26:21.610
So I'll have to tell my mom
that I ran into you.

26:21.679 --> 26:23.613
Oh, okay.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.851
Come here.

26:27.919 --> 26:31.855
Um, I never had a chance to tell you...

26:31.923 --> 26:35.188
but I'm really sorry about your mom.

26:35.259 --> 26:38.057
Oh, it's fine. Really.

26:38.129 --> 26:39.790
- What she say?
- Shh, shh.

26:39.864 --> 26:41.798
She said somethin'
about a ham sandwich.

26:41.866 --> 26:44.858
<i>No, I know, but I just wanted you</i>
<i>to know that I am sorry. </i>

26:44.936 --> 26:47.131
Naomi, really, it-

26:47.204 --> 26:49.138
Would you look at that?
Five hundred!

26:49.206 --> 26:52.573
- I'm fine.
- All right.

26:57.949 --> 27:03.182
Comin' through! Comin' through!
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

27:03.254 --> 27:07.054
<i>Y'all know what's going on. </i>
<i>Make room for Mr. Fantastic. </i>

27:07.124 --> 27:09.058
The pretty boy.
He's super bad!

27:09.126 --> 27:11.060
- He's super bad.
- <i>Super fly. </i>

27:11.128 --> 27:14.325
- He's fly.
- Baddest mo-fo on eight wheels.

27:14.398 --> 27:16.332
Make some noise for-

27:16.400 --> 27:21.531
Sweet... ness!

27:36.354 --> 27:38.288
Chill.

28:17.128 --> 28:20.723
- Sweetness, you're so fine!
- Yes, you are!

28:20.798 --> 28:22.959
- Junior!
- I was talkin' to Tootsie!

28:23.034 --> 28:25.832
- Hold yourself together, Tori.
- Cape.

28:31.709 --> 28:34.007
- Lint.
- Lint.

28:37.014 --> 28:39.141
<i>Be careful, honey!</i>

28:39.216 --> 28:42.185
Towel.

28:42.253 --> 28:45.279
<i>Look at that chest, baby!</i>

28:58.736 --> 29:00.966
No!

29:01.038 --> 29:03.598
<i>Mine!</i>

29:03.674 --> 29:05.835
I'll skate now.

29:13.584 --> 29:18.521
<i>Sweetness! Aha! He's too cool!</i>

29:18.589 --> 29:20.784
<i>Boogie on down. </i>

29:23.894 --> 29:28.160
<i>See? See? I told you Sweetness</i>
<i>had his own theme music. </i>

29:28.232 --> 29:31.531
Damn the music.
Sweetness got the honeys.

29:31.602 --> 29:35.436
I think Tootsie is scoping me.
Here, Tootsie, Tootsie, Tootsie!

29:35.506 --> 29:38.202
Man, I hope she don't
got the Bee Gees.

29:38.275 --> 29:40.835
I guess everybody loves
Sweetness around here, huh?

29:40.911 --> 29:42.845
Not everybody.

29:49.153 --> 29:51.178
Naomi!

29:53.023 --> 29:56.015
- What, Troy?
- <i>Come on, now. </i>

29:56.093 --> 29:58.084
You don't have to get
all attitude on me.

29:58.162 --> 30:01.427
I thought we were cool. Hey, what's up
with that fake number you gave me?

30:01.499 --> 30:03.524
Yeah, what's up with the fake digits?

30:03.601 --> 30:06.502
It wasn't fake.
They just weren't mine.

30:06.570 --> 30:10.097
Okay. Okay.

30:10.174 --> 30:14.406
I see how it is. Okay, so you won't give
me- <i>me</i>- your number?

30:14.478 --> 30:17.072
Instead you give it to a raggedy dude
with a crooked-ass 'fro.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.446
Yeah.

30:19.517 --> 30:21.508
Whatever.

30:21.585 --> 30:24.850
- I'll see you later, X.
- All right.

30:24.922 --> 30:27.618
Excuse me.

30:27.691 --> 30:31.024
Hey, Roy. Roy, check 'em out.
Check 'em out.

30:31.095 --> 30:33.655
I'm checking. I'm checking.

30:33.731 --> 30:36.200
<i>Wearin' them hand-me-down skates. </i>
<i>I mean, come on. </i>

30:36.333 --> 30:38.460
Who y'all supposed to be,
the food stamp crew?

30:38.535 --> 30:41.868
No, no, man. These are the welfare rollers.

30:41.939 --> 30:46.205
Man, I know you ain't talkin' with them
American Bandstand glittery pants on.

30:46.276 --> 30:50.906
What? What? You crazy?
These are the threads of champions.

30:50.981 --> 30:53.973
Sweetwater Rollers,
group skate champions.

30:54.051 --> 30:56.611
Five years runnin', baby.
Dig it.

30:56.687 --> 31:00.020
"Sweetwater Rollers.
Five years runnin', baby. "

31:00.090 --> 31:03.059
- Until now.
- Dig that!

31:03.126 --> 31:06.960
- John Travolta!
- Is this a challenge, Mr. Mouth?

31:07.030 --> 31:09.760
<i>Whatever you want it to be, Kung Fu!</i>

31:09.833 --> 31:12.427
You just say when.

31:12.502 --> 31:15.130
Right now, Cosby kids.
Come on.

31:15.205 --> 31:20.142
Why don't you bring your old Salvation Army
rent-a-skate crew out here right now, punks!

31:20.210 --> 31:23.304
Man, you ain't said nothin' but a word.

31:23.380 --> 31:25.678
You'll see, Jackson Five.

31:27.184 --> 31:29.675
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

31:29.753 --> 31:32.950
I don't know, man. Hey, look, let's
show these dudes how we do it on the-

31:33.023 --> 31:35.116
South Side!

31:35.192 --> 31:38.423
- Can I come too? 'Cause I-
- <i> No!</i>

31:38.495 --> 31:40.463
<i>Hell, no!</i>

31:40.530 --> 31:44.660
I didn't want to skate
with them anyway. Aah!

32:03.687 --> 32:05.655
Yeah!

32:26.376 --> 32:30.142
Oh, shoot! Come on, Junior.
Come on, Boo.

32:30.213 --> 32:33.580
Dang, y'all!

32:33.650 --> 32:36.847
I said size nine! Size nine!

32:38.822 --> 32:41.985
- Dang, they're too far ahead.
- All right, X man. Cut through the middle.

32:42.059 --> 32:44.653
- Come on. Come on, y'all.
- Hell, yeah.

32:45.762 --> 32:47.855
Come on, y'all.
We gotta catch up.

32:47.931 --> 32:50.764
- <i>Man, that Chinese boy's fast. </i>
- Let's get the train together.

33:00.510 --> 33:03.377
Watch out!

33:28.672 --> 33:31.607
<i>Y'all go on!</i>
<i>You're all weak anyways!</i>

33:31.675 --> 33:33.609
- Uh-huh.
- A bunch of suckers.

33:38.515 --> 33:42.975
- Yo, they was doin' moves
I never even seen before.
- Whatever.

33:43.053 --> 33:44.987
<i>Yeah, they were pretty good. </i>

33:45.055 --> 33:48.752
- <i>Whatever, man. It's home court</i>
<i>advantage. Don't even count. </i>
- <i> Whatever, Junior. </i>

33:48.825 --> 33:51.726
- I'm about to go to the snack bar
and get an Icee or somethin'.
- I'm with you, man.

33:51.795 --> 33:54.195
- Boo, you okay?
- Man, my eye's actin' up.

33:54.264 --> 33:56.289
Man, I'm rentin' new skates.

33:56.366 --> 33:59.199
- I'm- I'm gonna go sit down.
- Y'all go on.

33:59.269 --> 34:02.568
I'm about to get me some of Tootsie.

34:02.639 --> 34:05.335
<i>Here, Tootsie, Tootsie, Tootsie!</i>

34:05.409 --> 34:08.867
That thing that you're doin'-
kind of like a twist, like you're jumpin'...

34:08.945 --> 34:11.812
- and then kind of like-
- Tori, Tori, please, okay?

34:11.882 --> 34:13.815
- I'm telling you-
- Please!

34:21.658 --> 34:23.592
Gotcha!

34:26.730 --> 34:29.096
Oh!

34:31.668 --> 34:34.136
Oh, damn. Junior!

34:40.710 --> 34:42.974
- He's got a woody!
- Shut up! Shut up!

34:43.045 --> 34:45.344
<i>My baby's big!</i>

34:45.415 --> 34:47.781
Damn.

34:55.525 --> 35:00.758
Shut up! Shut up! First of all, they're
support briefs, and all the athletes wear 'em.

35:00.831 --> 35:04.198
Wilt Chamberlain,
Kareem Abdul-Jabaar, O.J. Simpson.

35:04.267 --> 35:06.201
They said they make you run faster.

35:06.269 --> 35:08.032
All the ones that wear bras!

35:08.104 --> 35:10.129
Shut up!

35:10.207 --> 35:13.370
- I'll show you somethin' big!
- Hey, man, this ain't funny!

35:13.443 --> 35:17.345
This is not no joke. These dudes
don't even respect us.

35:17.414 --> 35:20.679
They just chalk us up to be some poor
ghetto boys from the South Side...

35:20.750 --> 35:23.184
<i>that don't even have a pot to piss in. </i>

35:23.253 --> 35:25.244
And that's not even us.

35:25.322 --> 35:30.191
We're them boys used to go down
to the Gardens to skate our asses off.

35:31.728 --> 35:34.492
Now, I know I was the one
against goin' over there...

35:34.564 --> 35:39.058
but now, fellas, we gotta go there.

35:39.135 --> 35:41.535
Get back on top, no matter what.

35:44.674 --> 35:47.905
We need to kick ass
at this skate-off come August.

35:55.652 --> 35:59.383
- I see somebody got their balls off layaway.
- <i>Yeah, whatever. </i>

35:59.456 --> 36:01.390
You just stop wearin' purple panties...

36:01.458 --> 36:03.449
and start puttin' lotion
on your ashy butt.

36:03.527 --> 36:05.893
Hey, where we from, y'all?

36:05.962 --> 36:08.226
South Side!

36:08.298 --> 36:12.632
Hey, there's a homey right there!

36:32.889 --> 36:34.823
What?

36:41.498 --> 36:44.331
Bad dream?

36:46.369 --> 36:48.837
All right. Come on.

37:00.417 --> 37:04.376
- <i>Xavier?</i>
- Go to sleep.

37:04.454 --> 37:07.014
<i>What was Mom like?</i>

37:13.330 --> 37:15.423
Huh?

37:15.498 --> 37:20.094
Tell me what she was like again.

37:23.974 --> 37:25.908
Well...

37:27.978 --> 37:31.209
she was a lot like you.

37:31.281 --> 37:37.186
She was- She was always fantasizing
like she was somebody else.

37:37.253 --> 37:41.587
Diana Ross, Tina Turner.

37:44.628 --> 37:47.062
But she couldn't sing though.

37:47.130 --> 37:50.156
- No?
- No, not a lick.

37:52.302 --> 37:55.567
See, me and Dad didn't have
the heart to tell her...

37:55.639 --> 37:57.800
so we would just
sit back on the couch...

37:57.874 --> 38:00.104
and she'd just let it rip.

38:01.745 --> 38:05.647
Yeah, Mom was so pretty.

38:07.917 --> 38:10.181
Dad would always tell me...

38:10.253 --> 38:14.212
"Son, God must really like us. "

38:17.193 --> 38:20.890
Back then you couldn't
keep Dad from smiling.

38:20.964 --> 38:22.898
But when he looks at you...

38:22.966 --> 38:26.458
he gets that same grin on his face...

38:26.536 --> 38:29.505
just like when he used to look at Mom.

38:38.515 --> 38:41.712
Mom was like an angel.

38:41.785 --> 38:44.117
A black angel?

38:47.657 --> 38:51.184
Yeah, I guess so.

39:18.021 --> 39:21.650
<i>Have a good time, son. Make sure</i>
<i>you hold your sister's hand. </i>

39:21.725 --> 39:24.956
- And spend all his money, honey.
- Nice meeting you, Mr. Smith.

39:25.028 --> 39:27.792
Uh-huh.

39:30.333 --> 39:32.563
<i>Oh, baby, I love you. </i>

39:32.635 --> 39:35.433
- <i> Yes, you do. </i>
- <i>I love you. </i>

39:35.505 --> 39:37.769
<i>And I love you back. </i>

39:37.841 --> 39:40.275
I gotcha.

39:43.213 --> 39:45.340
Size 12!

39:45.415 --> 39:48.043
What it is.

39:48.118 --> 39:50.586
So?

39:50.653 --> 39:53.417
<i>You know, the ladies,</i>
<i>they can't get enough of Bernard. </i>

39:53.490 --> 39:58.359
I think it's the lips. You know,
not too pouty, not too brave.

39:58.428 --> 40:00.623
You know, firm and tender like sirloin.

40:00.697 --> 40:03.131
<i>I used to do lip exercises on my pillow. </i>

40:03.199 --> 40:05.497
And a-one and two-

40:05.568 --> 40:08.662
Can I get a size nine, please!

40:08.738 --> 40:13.175
Now. Today <i>. Ahora. </i>

40:13.243 --> 40:16.735
All right, 'fro magnum.

40:16.813 --> 40:18.804
Dude, calm down.

40:18.882 --> 40:21.350
Tryin' to bond with a brother, man.
That's all.

40:21.417 --> 40:23.351
You ain't tryin' to bond with me.

40:23.419 --> 40:27.515
You done gave me my skates a long
time ago, I wouldn't have to be waitin'.

40:27.590 --> 40:31.720
Dude, these are size 15's!

40:31.795 --> 40:35.026
Man, why you keep doin' me like this?

40:35.098 --> 40:38.397
Check this out.
The ladies around here...

40:38.468 --> 40:43.735
like a brother with a big... skate.

40:55.952 --> 40:59.251
You got a size 17
back there, Bernard?

40:59.322 --> 41:02.052
Size 17 back there, Bernard?

41:02.125 --> 41:04.753
Talkin' my talk now.
Let me get you the-

41:10.099 --> 41:12.033
Bye, X.

41:13.503 --> 41:15.596
I told you I didn't want to bring her.

41:15.672 --> 41:18.436
Oh, she don't wanna be with you.
She's goin' over there.

41:18.508 --> 41:21.341
<i>Look who it is. </i>

41:21.411 --> 41:24.778
'Sup, X? And how'd you get in, Jaws?

41:24.848 --> 41:27.248
I see the metal detector
must be broken.

41:27.317 --> 41:29.251
I don't know.

41:29.319 --> 41:32.288
Ask your big-boned mama.
She the one workin' the door.

41:32.355 --> 41:35.916
She got you again, Junior.

41:35.992 --> 41:38.119
- You two need to quit, okay?
- Oh, don't talk to me.

41:38.194 --> 41:40.924
Talk to him.

41:40.997 --> 41:42.931
Stupid.

41:46.870 --> 41:51.273
<i> Oh, no, man. There go them dude</i>
<i>in them tights again. He look fruity. </i>

41:51.341 --> 41:54.037
- <i>What is wrong with him?</i>
- Whatever. Hey, yo, X, lace up.

41:54.110 --> 41:56.806
I was watching <i>Kung Fu Theater. </i>
I know this move we could use.

41:56.880 --> 41:59.542
- All right.
- All right. Yo. Hey.

42:02.485 --> 42:04.817
Man, your friends are so stupid.

42:04.888 --> 42:07.652
Hey, you're just now figurin' that out?

42:07.724 --> 42:09.692
I know. Right.

42:09.759 --> 42:11.693
<i>Session two is now beginning. </i>

42:11.761 --> 42:14.457
<i>This next skate</i>
<i>will be for couples only. </i>

42:14.530 --> 42:16.828
<i>This is a couples’ skate. </i>

42:16.900 --> 42:18.834
- <i>Oh, look, look, look. </i>
- What? What?

42:18.902 --> 42:20.927
There goes your other friend.

42:23.506 --> 42:25.440
- Hi.
- Hey.

42:25.508 --> 42:28.238
- Hey, X.
- Hi.

42:28.311 --> 42:31.644
- Hi.
- How are you doin'?

42:37.754 --> 42:40.086
So, how's everything going?

42:40.156 --> 42:43.523
Everything's cool. Cool.

42:43.593 --> 42:46.255
And real cool.

42:46.329 --> 42:49.662
<i>So?</i>

42:49.732 --> 42:52.701
So?

42:52.769 --> 42:55.670
So?

42:55.738 --> 42:59.834
Isn't this couples' skate?
You two should go skate.

42:59.909 --> 43:01.843
I don't mind.

43:01.911 --> 43:04.436
Thank you. I mean-

43:09.886 --> 43:13.413
Hey, I remember those.
You've had those for a long time.

43:13.489 --> 43:15.957
Your mom gave 'em to you
on your 13th birthday, right?

43:18.928 --> 43:20.896
Right.

43:22.966 --> 43:27.300
So, you wanna go
get out there together?

43:29.172 --> 43:31.663
Uh, I can't.

43:33.309 --> 43:35.675
I ate somethin' today...

43:35.745 --> 43:37.975
and my stomach is actin' up,
and I don't think-

43:38.047 --> 43:42.484
It's okay. It's okay.
Maybe another time.

43:42.552 --> 43:46.079
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

43:47.724 --> 43:50.056
What a doof!

43:56.332 --> 43:59.893
What's happenin'?

44:04.073 --> 44:06.041
Hello?

44:06.109 --> 44:08.441
Come on. Come on. Come on.

44:11.681 --> 44:13.672
<i>Hello?</i>

44:13.750 --> 44:15.911
Hello.

44:15.985 --> 44:18.283
I'm Vivian. Vivian Turner,
your new neighbor.

44:18.354 --> 44:20.879
Oh. Hi. I'm Curtis.

44:20.957 --> 44:24.586
Uh, yeah. I just got home from work,
and I got this note from my daughter...

44:24.660 --> 44:27.390
saying she went skating with an- an X?

44:28.831 --> 44:33.359
Yes. Um, X is my son, Xavier.

44:33.436 --> 44:35.904
I dropped 'em off
a little while ago at the rink.

44:35.972 --> 44:38.270
Okay. Well, is this
a once-in-a-while thing...

44:38.341 --> 44:41.708
or do you make a practice of dropping off
people's kids that you don't even know?

44:41.778 --> 44:44.076
- Hey, what-
- <i>'Cause if it is... </i>

44:44.147 --> 44:47.947
then maybe the authorities
should be notified about your activities.

44:48.017 --> 44:52.215
- Look, Mrs. Turner-
- Miss Turner.

44:52.288 --> 44:57.225
Oh, it's miss. Okay, Miss Lady
With A Bad Attitude, whatever-

44:57.293 --> 45:02.030
Calm down, okay? The kids
were gonna ride the bus to the rink.

45:02.163 --> 45:03.858
But, you know, bein'
the neglectful parent that I am...

45:03.931 --> 45:06.126
I decided to give 'em a ride anyway.

45:06.200 --> 45:09.431
Now, since you're so concerned
about your daughter's welfare...

45:09.504 --> 45:11.404
I suggest you take a ride up to the rink.

45:11.472 --> 45:14.407
It's about 30 minutes up Imperial.
They close at midnight.

45:14.475 --> 45:16.807
However, my son will be here at 8:00.

45:16.878 --> 45:20.439
So you can either wait-
but, you know, in your garage-

45:20.515 --> 45:24.611
or you can go down there and be known
as the party-crashin' mama on the block...

45:24.685 --> 45:27.654
and give your daughter a serious complex
for the rest of her natural-born life.

45:27.722 --> 45:30.020
Your choice.

45:33.761 --> 45:37.094
- Your carburetor's flooded.
- So is yours.

45:37.165 --> 45:39.099
<i>Big old Fat Albert look-alike. </i>

45:39.167 --> 45:41.260
<i>Must be crazy talkin' to me like</i>-

45:41.335 --> 45:44.270
How do you know
the carburetor's flooded?

45:44.338 --> 45:47.671
You need to put
some lotion on them feet.

45:51.079 --> 45:54.776
Man, this is Bruce Lee's <i>Fists of Fury. </i>

45:54.849 --> 45:57.215
Ain't nobody doin' this in the competition.

45:57.285 --> 45:59.685
I wonder why, Junior.

46:01.022 --> 46:03.889
Ah, now what?

46:03.958 --> 46:09.521
<i> And here he is,</i>
<i>center floor, Sweetwater's finest. </i>

46:09.597 --> 46:12.623
<i>Give it up for Sweetness. </i>

46:40.628 --> 46:44.086
Go Sweetness! Go Sweetness!
Go Sweetness! Go Sweetness!

46:44.165 --> 46:47.657
Go Sweetness! Go Sweetness!
Go Sweetness!

46:47.735 --> 46:51.034
Go Sweetness! Go Sweetness!

47:42.056 --> 47:45.423
I-I don't know, y'all. I mean, he's good.

47:45.493 --> 47:47.586
- Told you.
- He's okay.

47:47.662 --> 47:50.096
But I've seen X do all those moves.

48:01.909 --> 48:04.673
<i>Oh, oh, oh, hell, no!</i>

48:04.745 --> 48:06.713
- Ohhh.
- Except that one.

48:06.781 --> 48:08.908
Now, that was good.
I'll give that a 10.

48:12.086 --> 48:15.783
Hey, Poindexter, get off me.

48:15.856 --> 48:19.019
Get off of me, man!
You okay?

48:19.093 --> 48:22.790
Somebody fan her for me.

48:35.843 --> 48:38.107
Yeah.

48:47.054 --> 48:49.852
Hey, I didn't know you were here.

48:49.924 --> 48:52.154
Didn't see the Mustang out front.

48:52.226 --> 48:55.218
Oh, um, yeah.

48:55.296 --> 48:59.130
It's been, uh, giving me a little trouble,
so I put it in the shop.

48:59.200 --> 49:01.065
Hmm.

49:02.470 --> 49:04.563
Hey, Dad, where you goin'?

49:04.639 --> 49:08.166
Oh, just over to Miss Jenkins's house.

49:08.242 --> 49:10.176
She havin' a little get-together.

49:10.244 --> 49:12.712
She kinda cornered me
in the frozen food section today...

49:12.780 --> 49:15.180
so, you know,
I have to show my face.

49:18.519 --> 49:20.646
Are there gonna be women there?

49:23.491 --> 49:28.554
<i>It's just that I've never seen you</i>
<i>get all dressed up like this before. </i>

49:28.629 --> 49:33.225
Wearing cologne.

49:33.301 --> 49:38.034
Son, it's just a party.

49:38.105 --> 49:40.665
Oh, no, no, no.
It's cool. It's cool.

49:40.741 --> 49:42.675
- Oh, it's cool?
- It's cool.

49:42.743 --> 49:46.679
- Take your time. Your time.
- Thank you so much.

49:49.016 --> 49:52.645
- So, how was Sweetwater?
- Oh, it was good.

49:52.720 --> 49:56.383
See, Dad, we're goin' against this guy named
Sweetness and his crew at the skate-off.

49:56.457 --> 49:59.153
- Think you'll make it?
- I don't know, son.

49:59.226 --> 50:02.753
I may have to work.

50:02.830 --> 50:04.923
Oh.

50:04.999 --> 50:07.399
<i>You know, to be honest, son... </i>

50:07.468 --> 50:10.733
you could be doin' something more constructive
than wasting time at that skatin' rink.

50:14.342 --> 50:17.209
Mom didn't think it was a waste of time.

50:22.249 --> 50:25.741
- <i>Daddy!</i>
- Hey, pretty girl. Come on. Come on.

50:25.820 --> 50:28.948
Oh, boy, you're gettin'
so big, baby. Oh, man.

50:29.023 --> 50:31.787
- You smell good, Daddy.
- Oh, thank you, baby.

50:31.859 --> 50:34.259
<i>Can you read me a story?</i>

50:34.328 --> 50:37.320
<i>Mmm, yeah, I can read you a story. </i>

50:37.398 --> 50:39.662
<i>Man, you've got to be crazy. </i>

50:39.734 --> 50:43.033
You ain't got to be from Ohio
to be one in Ohio, player.

50:43.104 --> 50:45.095
This Tino glamour, baby.

50:45.172 --> 50:47.504
- Hey, Rhonda, what's goin' on?
- Hi, Tino.

50:47.575 --> 50:49.509
- Nothin' much.
- How you doin'?

50:49.577 --> 50:53.240
- Good.
- How'd you get these napkins
to match that outfit, mama?

50:53.314 --> 50:55.908
- You know, you do your thing right here.
- I gotta do my thing.

50:55.983 --> 50:58.349
- Get off my phone.
- <i>All right, my heart. Hold on. </i>

50:58.419 --> 51:02.014
<i>It ain't long distance. </i>
<i>You know what I'm sayin'.</i>

51:02.089 --> 51:04.956
<i>I thought I'd bring you a drink. </i>

51:05.025 --> 51:08.461
Oh, um, thanks, Rhonda,
but I don't drink.

51:08.529 --> 51:11.327
You don't drink? What,
you a Jehovah Witness or somethin'?

51:11.399 --> 51:14.800
- No, I'm just not a drinker. That's all.
- Mm.

51:14.869 --> 51:19.203
- But, hey, I do like all this,
uh, cheetah thing you got goin'.
- Cheetah?

51:19.273 --> 51:23.039
It's leopard.
Cheetah's too gaudy.

51:24.111 --> 51:26.306
Huh.

51:26.380 --> 51:29.076
Well, I'll get you a Pepsi.

51:29.150 --> 51:32.711
- Okay.
- You keep that wall up for me.

51:35.089 --> 51:37.785
Ooh, Curtis, my man!
Curtis, my man!

51:37.858 --> 51:41.521
Big Curtis! I didn't know
you was on Rhonda.

51:41.595 --> 51:45.554
<i>What? No, man. I'm just</i>-
<i>I ain't on nothin' but this wall. </i>

51:45.633 --> 51:48.830
- Okay? Just the wall.
- Man, if I wasn't miserably married, man...

51:48.903 --> 51:51.963
I'd be tryin' to tame
that big wild kingdom.

51:52.039 --> 51:54.735
Whole lot of rumblin' engine.

51:54.809 --> 51:57.039
And she make a damn good rib.

51:57.111 --> 52:00.205
I'll handle that cat.

52:00.281 --> 52:02.442
Beat that cat down.

52:04.084 --> 52:06.211
Let me get a piece of that rib.

52:06.287 --> 52:08.312
Hey, man, don't touch my rib.

52:08.389 --> 52:11.586
Rhonda, you ain't slick.
We saw you over there working Curtis.

52:11.659 --> 52:15.095
What? Okay. Girl, please. I wasn't doin'
nothin' but gettin' that man a Pepsi.

52:15.162 --> 52:17.096
- That's all.
- Mm-hmm.

52:17.164 --> 52:19.655
- But he is fine.
- Girl, yes, he is!

52:19.733 --> 52:24.067
Oh, I just feel so sorry
about what happened to Kathy.

52:24.138 --> 52:26.106
- Yeah, I know.
- Oh, yeah.

52:26.173 --> 52:28.664
- That was a beautiful woman.
- Yes, she was.

52:28.742 --> 52:30.676
- <i> She was. </i>
- Now, who's Kathy?

52:30.744 --> 52:32.837
- <i>Oh, that's right. You don't know, do you?</i>
- Mm-mm.

52:32.913 --> 52:34.972
- Kathy was his wife.
- Oh.

52:35.049 --> 52:37.882
<i>She died last year</i>- <i>What was that</i>-
<i>two weeks or so before Christmas?</i>

52:37.952 --> 52:41.285
- Oh.
- <i>Turns out she had</i>
<i>some sort of a heart condition. </i>

52:41.355 --> 52:44.586
- It was sad. I feel bad for those kids.
- Mm, baby. Really sad.

52:44.658 --> 52:47.354
- <i>Oh. </i>
- <i>Yeah, it is. </i>

52:47.428 --> 52:51.194
<i> In the meantime,</i>
<i>I'm gonna get him that Pepsi. </i>

52:51.265 --> 52:53.290
Girl.

52:53.367 --> 52:55.597
That's a cute outfit, girl.

52:58.172 --> 53:00.868
You need to work on your aim.

53:00.941 --> 53:02.966
- Ah, they'll find it.
- Ohhh!

53:03.043 --> 53:04.977
Maybe they'll start
payin' me on time.

53:05.045 --> 53:07.980
Hey, what's up with you
and that Naomi girl?

53:08.048 --> 53:10.107
You guys used to date?

53:10.184 --> 53:13.813
No, we were just friends.

53:13.888 --> 53:16.413
- You should like her.
- <i>Huh?</i>

53:16.490 --> 53:19.015
You heard me.
She's a cute girl.

53:19.093 --> 53:21.789
What's not to like?
I see you checking her out.

53:21.862 --> 53:24.831
Drooling, mouth all open.
But you ain't gotta be ashamed.

53:24.899 --> 53:27.026
You know, I was gonna
tell you, though...

53:27.101 --> 53:29.365
when you're with a girl,
you gotta be cool, okay?

53:29.436 --> 53:32.894
You can't be no nerd letting her see you dribble,
because that you should be ashamed of.

53:32.973 --> 53:37.000
- Your daddy should've told you this, but anyway-
- Tori.

53:37.077 --> 53:39.011
Throw a paper.

53:47.054 --> 53:49.648
All right, we got a live one.
Are we ready?

53:49.723 --> 53:51.657
We're ready.

54:00.701 --> 54:02.965
Tori!

54:04.705 --> 54:06.764
Hey, X! Hey!

54:14.615 --> 54:17.880
Ah! Ah, ah! Oh!

54:21.822 --> 54:24.290
Tori!

54:27.428 --> 54:29.396
No!

54:33.267 --> 54:35.929
Man, no! Get outta here,
you little punks!

54:38.038 --> 54:40.336
Tori, you all right?

54:44.378 --> 54:48.007
Shut up. Just shut up.

54:48.082 --> 54:52.416
<i> Got you!</i>

54:54.822 --> 54:57.620
We got three weeks till the skate-off.

54:57.691 --> 54:59.750
We need to step it up.

54:59.827 --> 55:04.389
Last week at Sweetwater-
I ain't gonna name no names, Naps-

55:04.465 --> 55:06.558
- What?
- But last week at Sweetwater...

55:06.634 --> 55:08.932
some of us looked like crap.

55:09.003 --> 55:11.233
What?

55:11.305 --> 55:14.365
I'm gonna be ready.
I'm clutch.

55:14.441 --> 55:18.172
No, what you need to do
is clutch some skating skills, clown.

55:18.245 --> 55:22.011
Yeah, stop rentin' skates. Why don't you
just wear the ones that you have on?

55:22.082 --> 55:25.711
Dude, what do I look like
rolling in my sister's skates?

55:25.786 --> 55:28.846
<i>No different. </i>
<i>You still look goofy. </i>

55:28.922 --> 55:32.380
- <i>Forget you, Mike, albino punk. </i>
- Whatever, Ricky Ricardo.

55:32.459 --> 55:35.758
Hurry up! <i>What's Happening</i>
comes on at 4:00.

55:35.829 --> 55:38.798
<i>Mind your business, chain saw lips!</i>

55:38.866 --> 55:42.029
Naps, take the box.
Get in formation.

55:55.115 --> 55:59.051
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

55:59.119 --> 56:00.609
Come on, Boo.
Good job, man.

56:00.688 --> 56:04.419
Here we go, fellas.
Come on, fellas. Yeah.

56:10.798 --> 56:12.732
Looks like an airplane.

56:12.800 --> 56:14.768
- Like this?
- Like an airplane.

56:27.081 --> 56:30.346
South Side!

56:46.400 --> 56:51.463
Hi. Um, I'm here to inquire about
the quality control engineering position.

56:51.538 --> 56:54.006
Oh, yeah, it's open.

56:54.074 --> 56:57.373
So, do you have any experience, uh-

56:57.444 --> 56:59.605
Curtis. I'm sorry. Curtis Smith.

56:59.680 --> 57:01.580
Any experience, Curtis?

57:01.648 --> 57:03.878
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do. I, uh-

57:03.951 --> 57:07.512
I got my degree in mechanical engineering
from Arizona State University.

57:07.588 --> 57:10.955
<i>I've been at Chicago Air</i>
<i>designing airplanes for 10 years... </i>

57:11.024 --> 57:14.221
until they folded, so, uh-

57:14.294 --> 57:18.628
<i>So I guess, yeah, I have a little bit. </i>

57:18.699 --> 57:21.327
What's so funny?

57:21.401 --> 57:24.370
My man, I don't think
this is the job for you.

57:24.438 --> 57:27.464
<i>Why? Now, I know</i>
<i>I can handle the job. </i>

57:27.541 --> 57:30.169
- Now, just-You haven't even seen-
- <i>Curtis. Curtis. </i>

57:30.244 --> 57:34.874
Quality control engineer
is just a fancy way of saying janitor.

57:34.948 --> 57:37.473
I'm looking for a janitor...

57:37.551 --> 57:41.078
and the last I checked,
you don't need a degree to mop.

57:41.155 --> 57:44.147
Sorry, brother.

57:44.224 --> 57:46.158
Yeah.

57:52.833 --> 57:58.672
<i>Excuse me. </i>
<i>How much does it pay?</i>

57:58.805 --> 58:02.002
- Oh, Naps, like this.
- Hey, yo, pass the chips.

58:02.075 --> 58:05.374
- X, can I play?
- No. Go play with your Barbies or something.

58:05.445 --> 58:10.508
- I'm telling Dad you won't let me play with you.
- So?

58:10.583 --> 58:13.518
- <i> "I'm telling Daddy you</i>
<i>won't let me play with you. "</i>
- <i>Bye. </i>

58:13.586 --> 58:16.749
That's why I can't be no older brother,
man. Just too much stress.

58:16.823 --> 58:19.656
That's why I'm happy my mama
got her tubes tied, you know?

58:19.726 --> 58:22.354
<i> So are we. </i>

58:22.429 --> 58:24.397
Yeah, I like that one.
I like that one.

58:24.464 --> 58:27.092
- 'Cause he's funny-looking.
- Ain't that a blip, Boo?

58:27.167 --> 58:31.103
No, no. Better yet,
ain't that some lips, Boo?

58:31.171 --> 58:35.403
<i>Because I know your charcoal butt</i>
<i>ain't tryin’ to bag on somebody. </i>

58:35.475 --> 58:37.875
He walkin' around here
lookin' like a skid mark.

58:37.944 --> 58:40.310
I don't look like
no skid mark, Junior.

58:40.380 --> 58:42.610
I know- I know you're
not laughing, half-breed.

58:42.682 --> 58:45.116
<i>Yeah, that's right. </i>
<i>'Cause you all mixed up. </i>

58:45.185 --> 58:47.745
He don't know if he want
a sweet potato pie or pumpkin pie.

58:47.821 --> 58:50.722
Barry White or the Bee Gees.

58:50.790 --> 58:53.418
Look at you, lookin' like
a white boy with sprinkles.

58:53.493 --> 58:55.427
Get off me, man.

58:55.495 --> 58:59.659
Get off me, man! Naps,
aren't you Puerto Rican, huh?

58:59.733 --> 59:02.258
- Aren't you supposed to have good hair?
- <i>Mm-hmm. </i>

59:02.335 --> 59:04.667
What is this, man?

59:04.738 --> 59:07.298
You're a disgrace to your race.
His hair's so nappy...

59:07.373 --> 59:09.739
when he comb, it sounds
like he's biting an apple.

59:12.579 --> 59:15.412
Oh, your daddy mad. Your daddy
don't claim you, do he?

59:15.482 --> 59:19.111
Little baby crying, and,
<i>"Poquito, Jesucristo. "</i>

59:19.185 --> 59:21.119
Ah, my hand's stuck.
Somebody help me.

59:21.187 --> 59:23.121
Mine too. Hold up!

59:23.189 --> 59:25.123
Hey!

59:25.191 --> 59:29.252
I do have good hair.

01:00:01.261 --> 01:00:03.627
<i>Hey, Curtis. What's happening?</i>

01:00:03.696 --> 01:00:06.358
Hey.

01:00:06.432 --> 01:00:09.799
I'll get-

01:00:14.374 --> 01:00:17.002
I got 12.

01:00:31.457 --> 01:00:34.153
H- H-How you doin', Mr. Curtis?

01:00:44.304 --> 01:00:46.932
Whose is this?

01:00:49.742 --> 01:00:51.903
- Is this yours?
- Huh?

01:00:51.978 --> 01:00:54.208
Boy, don't try to act like you
didn't hear me with them big ears.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.510
You probably heard the sun
come up this mornin'.

01:00:56.583 --> 01:01:00.349
Take this and roll your
big-eared butt home with it.

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:04.789
You know, you got-
Mr. Smith, you got a little leaf, but-

01:01:12.332 --> 01:01:17.998
How many times do I have to tell you kids
not to leave nothin' on my porch?

01:01:18.071 --> 01:01:21.404
Almost broke my neck out there!

01:01:21.474 --> 01:01:26.138
What you laughin' at, boy? Diana Ross called.
Tell your mama to give her wigs back.

01:01:26.212 --> 01:01:29.306
<i>I'm sorry, sir. It's just sometimes</i>
<i>I laugh when I get nervous. </i>

01:01:29.382 --> 01:01:32.146
I got a laughing condition.
Doctor said it's serious.

01:01:32.218 --> 01:01:34.709
Ha!

01:01:34.787 --> 01:01:37.585
I'm gonna count to five-
matter of fact, I'm gonna count to four-

01:01:37.657 --> 01:01:40.490
and if by the time I get to four,
you standing in my house-

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.621
- Oh, shit. Mixed Mike.
What about Mixed Mike?

01:01:44.697 --> 01:01:48.463
- <i> Save yourself!</i>
- What you waitin' on? Christmas?

01:01:48.534 --> 01:01:53.267
- Get outta here.
- Oh, um-

01:01:53.339 --> 01:01:57.002
And if I ain't got some Yoo-hoo left,
you gonna see a snake playin' the bongos...

01:01:57.076 --> 01:02:00.239
before you go to that skatin' rink again.

01:02:04.717 --> 01:02:07.481
And who left the white boy?

01:02:13.726 --> 01:02:16.593
<i>Mervyn like kissin' that floor, huh?</i>

01:02:16.663 --> 01:02:21.100
Yeah. He try that trick 50 times a day
and don't never hit it.

01:02:21.167 --> 01:02:25.570
- Tough little cat though.
- Yeah. I mean, you ask me...

01:02:25.638 --> 01:02:28.368
I just think he should just go on ahead
and just try somethin' else.

01:02:28.441 --> 01:02:31.501
I mean, all this fallin' and stuff?
It's just not cool.

01:02:31.577 --> 01:02:36.947
Hey, if you don't fall, how you gonna
know what gettin' up is like, right?

01:03:09.482 --> 01:03:13.145
One, two!

01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:20.554
One, two!

01:03:45.618 --> 01:03:47.643
Hey.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.382
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Daddy!

01:03:50.456 --> 01:03:55.018
Thank you.

01:03:59.799 --> 01:04:03.291
If you're lookin' for your daughter,
I haven't seen her.

01:04:03.369 --> 01:04:09.001
Actually, I'm not here for that.
I'm here for a do-over for when
I blew up at you a while back.

01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:14.446
I was out of line, and I apologize.

01:04:16.649 --> 01:04:19.117
Whoo. Slippery.

01:04:19.185 --> 01:04:22.177
Um, anyway,
I have a peace offering.

01:04:22.255 --> 01:04:26.385
Strawberry shortcake for me
and a chocolate éclair for you.

01:04:28.394 --> 01:04:32.296
What do you say?

01:04:32.365 --> 01:04:34.560
So next summer,
when I visit my daddy in Atlanta...

01:04:34.634 --> 01:04:37.296
ooh, boy, he's taking me everywhere:

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:41.898
Sightseeing in New York
and then to Orlando to visit NASA.

01:04:41.974 --> 01:04:45.410
Yeah. And then he's taking me
to the Bahamas to lay on the beach...

01:04:45.478 --> 01:04:47.605
and soak up the sun.

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.411
Make sure you soak up some beauty tips
while you're down there, chomper.

01:04:51.484 --> 01:04:54.749
- Shut up!
- I'm just sayin' you could hurt
somebody with those things.

01:04:54.821 --> 01:05:00.487
- Hey, isn't that your pop's car?
- That car do look familiar.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.961
This can't be your daddy's car,
man, for real. How much is this?

01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:06.089
- What? Yeah?
- <i>Excuse me. </i>

01:05:06.165 --> 01:05:09.157
- When did you get this car?
- Couple weeks ago.

01:05:09.235 --> 01:05:11.635
She's a honey, ain't she?

01:05:11.704 --> 01:05:14.537
X, this is definitely your pop's car.

01:05:14.607 --> 01:05:18.043
- Mr. Smith is your father?
- Yeah.

01:05:18.111 --> 01:05:22.138
Oh, what a nice guy. Hey, you tell
your old man if he's still interested...

01:05:22.215 --> 01:05:26.311
in a job in sales, I might have something
for him by the end of the month.

01:05:26.385 --> 01:05:30.549
- Yeah, but my dad already has a job.
- Ah. Well, good for him.

01:05:30.623 --> 01:05:34.184
<i>You know, men like your father,</i>
<i>they never stay out of work for long. </i>

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:39.562
They always land on their feet.
Excuse me, kids. I smell money.

01:05:39.632 --> 01:05:42.999
<i>That dude's crazy. "I smell money. "</i>

01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:46.004
That guy looked like Jimmy Carter.

01:05:46.072 --> 01:05:47.539
Let's go.

01:05:52.612 --> 01:05:55.843
I'll be right back. Xavier.

01:05:55.915 --> 01:05:59.476
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:05:59.552 --> 01:06:05.081
Um, I was thinking that
we should hang out sometime.

01:06:05.158 --> 01:06:07.888
We should go to the movies
or something again.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:13.694
Naomi, look. I just gotta go, okay?

01:06:13.766 --> 01:06:16.929
Oh, my gosh. X, are you okay?

01:06:17.003 --> 01:06:21.337
Look, just leave me alone, okay?

01:06:21.474 --> 01:06:24.875
And it should be a crime for you
to comb this girl's hair.

01:06:24.944 --> 01:06:28.038
Honey, don't I do a good job
on your hair?

01:06:28.114 --> 01:06:31.174
- See? That's the truth.
- Ooh, that's cold.

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:34.185
- I thought you was my friend.
- She's still your friend.

01:06:34.253 --> 01:06:36.187
<i>See how you do your daddy?</i>
<i>There he is. Hey, son. </i>

01:06:36.255 --> 01:06:38.849
- <i> Hey, Xavier. </i>
- Hey.

01:06:38.925 --> 01:06:42.554
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

01:06:42.628 --> 01:06:47.759
"I don't wanna talk about it. "
Being a teenager sure must be hard work.

01:06:47.833 --> 01:06:50.700
- <i>Tell me about it. </i>
- Kids.

01:06:52.905 --> 01:06:55.931
I think you're the last person
that should be talking about work.

01:07:00.046 --> 01:07:02.674
I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.
You wanna repeat it?

01:07:02.748 --> 01:07:07.151
Yeah. I said that you shouldn't
be talkin' about workin'...

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:09.620
seein' that you haven't
had a job in months.

01:07:11.657 --> 01:07:15.718
<i>By the way, I found out</i>
<i>about the car too. </i>

01:07:15.795 --> 01:07:17.888
Hot buy.

01:07:26.239 --> 01:07:31.142
Okay. Um, Xavier, go on in the house.
I can explain this to you.

01:07:32.678 --> 01:07:37.911
- Explain what? What kind of liar you are?
- <i> Let's go. </i>

01:07:37.984 --> 01:07:42.250
Fakin' us out every morning like you're
goin' to work, when really you weren't?

01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:50.353
- You're just a fake.
- Son, listen to me.

01:07:50.429 --> 01:07:55.298
You think you know, okay?
But you don't know, all right?

01:07:55.368 --> 01:07:58.804
- You don't know anything.
- I know Mom wouldn't have lied;
I know that much.

01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:07.236
You know, you're right. You're
absolutely right. You got me, son.

01:08:07.313 --> 01:08:12.341
Your mother wouldn't have lied to you,
okay? But I'm not your mother, okay?

01:08:12.418 --> 01:08:15.910
You want me to tell the truth? Here's
the truth. Hear it, understand it, son.

01:08:15.988 --> 01:08:19.947
Your mother, my wife?
She's gone.

01:08:20.026 --> 01:08:22.893
Gone, son.
She's never gonna come back.

01:08:22.962 --> 01:08:26.591
- And the sooner you let her go
and understand that-
- Let her go?

01:08:26.666 --> 01:08:30.500
You want me to let my mother go?
Why would I do that?

01:08:30.569 --> 01:08:35.506
You haven't, have you?
Yeah. You moved around some furniture...

01:08:35.573 --> 01:08:39.340
and threw up some wallpaper,
but you still haven't let her go.

01:08:39.412 --> 01:08:41.676
- That's why her piece-of-shit car
is still out in the garage.
- Hey. Hey!

01:08:41.747 --> 01:08:45.774
- Watch your mouth!
- Old piece of junk! I hate that car!

01:08:45.850 --> 01:08:49.343
You hang out with that car more
than you hang out with your own son.

01:08:49.421 --> 01:08:52.550
And then you think by puttin' in a new
engine, you can bring back the dead?

01:08:52.625 --> 01:08:54.718
All right. That's it.
Shut your mouth...

01:08:54.794 --> 01:08:57.160
get your skates, go in the house
and go to your room.

01:08:57.229 --> 01:09:00.493
Maybe if you banged on the hood
hard enough, maybe she'll come back.

01:09:00.566 --> 01:09:03.796
- Xavier.
- Hmm? Is that what you really want?

01:09:03.868 --> 01:09:07.270
You want her to come back
to take care of us so you don't have to?

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:10.332
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

01:09:10.408 --> 01:09:12.707
- Go in the house, son.
- No.

01:09:12.778 --> 01:09:15.872
I wanna see
if she'll come back, Dad.

01:09:15.948 --> 01:09:18.006
Xavier.

01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:22.216
Boy, don't you walk away from me
when I'm talk-Xavier!

01:09:22.287 --> 01:09:25.051
Don't you walk away from me
when I'm talkin' to you!

01:09:25.124 --> 01:09:27.684
<i>Xavier!</i>

01:09:29.095 --> 01:09:31.120
<i>Xavier!</i>

01:09:34.133 --> 01:09:37.660
- Put it down.
- No! You want Mom back, right?

01:09:37.737 --> 01:09:40.729
Well, let's see
if she'll come back then!

01:09:40.805 --> 01:09:43.832
- Put it down!
- Is that what you want?
Mom's not comin' back, Dad!

01:09:43.908 --> 01:09:46.469
- She's not comin' back!
- Xavier!

01:09:46.545 --> 01:09:49.241
- <i>Do you see her? She's dead, okay?</i>
- I'm talkin' to you, boy!

01:09:49.314 --> 01:09:52.113
You think you a man today?
If I have to put my hands on you...

01:09:52.184 --> 01:09:55.745
I swear to God you gonna find out
which one of us is a man today!

01:09:55.821 --> 01:10:01.225
All right? My mom's not comin' back,
all right? My mom's gone, man.

01:10:01.293 --> 01:10:06.424
<i>Huh? All right?</i>

01:10:06.499 --> 01:10:11.835
Why'd God have to take my mom, man?
God took my mom away from me.

01:10:11.904 --> 01:10:13.895
Son.

01:10:15.441 --> 01:10:19.969
Okay. Shh, shh, shh.

01:10:20.045 --> 01:10:23.640
- Listen to me.
- Man, get off!

01:10:45.771 --> 01:10:49.298
- Well, look like somebody
got up early this mornin'.
- Early.

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:52.173
<i>That's what I'm talkin' about. </i>
<i>Got your green outfit... </i>

01:10:52.244 --> 01:10:54.337
lookin' like little lion
off of <i>The Wizard of Oz. </i>

01:10:54.413 --> 01:10:58.281
"I'll fight you
with one hand behind my back. Put 'em up.

01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:01.877
Put 'em up. " Now you mad.

01:11:01.954 --> 01:11:04.388
Hey, son.

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.166
Oh, shit. Morning.

01:11:18.237 --> 01:11:21.229
What's up, Curt?
Ain't nobody scared of you.

01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:59.998
This came for you.
Gotta go fold the rest of my papers.

01:13:00.072 --> 01:13:04.873
Hey, X. Do me a favor.
Open this for me, would you?

01:13:04.944 --> 01:13:07.606
My wrist is kinda bothering me.

01:13:25.363 --> 01:13:31.233
<i>I saw how your old ones were fallin' apart,</i>
<i>so I just, you know, got you these. </i>

01:13:31.303 --> 01:13:36.331
Hey, I know they'll never replace
the ones your mother got you...

01:13:36.408 --> 01:13:40.071
but, um, they're here if you need 'em.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.610
- Why'd you do this?
- <i>I don't know. </i>

01:13:44.683 --> 01:13:46.708
Guilt?

01:13:48.019 --> 01:13:51.147
Not gettin' 'em for you sooner.

01:13:53.758 --> 01:13:57.694
For not being much of a father
to you since your mother passed.

01:14:07.672 --> 01:14:10.334
Listen up.

01:14:12.677 --> 01:14:15.510
When your mom died...

01:14:17.382 --> 01:14:23.082
I thought I could just, you know,
handle everything on my own...

01:14:23.154 --> 01:14:26.715
you know, show you kids
how strong I was.

01:14:26.791 --> 01:14:29.726
I thought that's
what you needed, you know.

01:14:31.763 --> 01:14:36.393
I don't know. I just wanted us
to act like nothing ever happened.

01:14:38.837 --> 01:14:44.434
But, um, it did happen...

01:14:46.745 --> 01:14:50.181
and it hurts.

01:14:50.248 --> 01:14:54.014
But, you know,
what hurt the most is...

01:14:54.085 --> 01:14:59.648
I forgot that you
and your sister were hurtin' too.

01:14:59.724 --> 01:15:03.091
You're not grown-ups;
you're just children.

01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:09.063
I know she was more
than your mother.

01:15:09.134 --> 01:15:12.103
She was your best friend...

01:15:12.170 --> 01:15:15.230
and I forgot that.

01:15:17.342 --> 01:15:20.607
And I'm really ashamed of myself.

01:15:23.181 --> 01:15:27.811
But, look, there's some things
we gotta put behind us.

01:15:27.886 --> 01:15:33.552
You know, you've been angry at me.
I've been angry at you.

01:15:33.625 --> 01:15:38.927
You know. And your mother
would be so disappointed.

01:15:43.301 --> 01:15:46.600
I just think she would expect
better from both of us.

01:15:50.508 --> 01:15:53.500
Whoo. So, look...

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:59.983
I hope you can forgive your old dad
for being an idiot and-

01:16:03.088 --> 01:16:09.027
I just want you
to know, son, I see you...

01:16:10.195 --> 01:16:13.187
Xavier Curtis Smith.

01:16:14.899 --> 01:16:18.335
I see you clearer
than you'll ever know, son.

01:16:20.371 --> 01:16:24.535
- Kid, I love you so much.
- Love you too, Dad.

01:16:25.944 --> 01:16:28.674
I know. I know.

01:17:00.879 --> 01:17:05.009
Xavier, what are you-
what are you doing down here?

01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:07.984
Just come outside.

01:17:12.357 --> 01:17:17.351
Look, um, are you going
to the skate-off on Saturday?

01:17:17.428 --> 01:17:20.488
- Yeah. I'll be there.
- Oh, good.

01:17:20.565 --> 01:17:26.026
Uh, look, I was-
I was wonderin'-

01:17:26.104 --> 01:17:29.164
maybe, you know,
like, afterwards...

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:32.073
me and you could
maybe go to a movie?

01:17:32.143 --> 01:17:36.910
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. I-

01:17:36.981 --> 01:17:40.382
Xavier, I don't think so.

01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:45.922
I mean, it's not that I don't
like you or anything. It's just-

01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:49.756
Naomi, look,
I'm sorry about before.

01:17:49.828 --> 01:17:53.059
- All right? I was trippin'.
- Yeah.

01:17:53.131 --> 01:17:58.865
I just had so much on my mind,
and you just don't even know.

01:17:58.937 --> 01:18:01.906
But I'm cool now. I'm cool.

01:18:01.973 --> 01:18:06.307
- You're cool now?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:06.377 --> 01:18:09.175
Well, you know what?
I'm not.

01:18:09.247 --> 01:18:11.647
I don't like being blown off
because you have problems.

01:18:11.716 --> 01:18:16.153
The world is full of problems.
Everybody has their own problems.

01:18:27.799 --> 01:18:30.393
<i>Naomi?</i>

01:18:31.803 --> 01:18:36.137
- Huh?
- <i> Come turn the channel for me. </i>

01:18:37.642 --> 01:18:41.373
I should- go.

01:18:57.428 --> 01:18:59.623
Yeah.

01:19:17.582 --> 01:19:19.846
<i> So you went out?</i>

01:19:19.918 --> 01:19:22.910
- <i> There's Naomi. </i>
- Hey, guys!

01:19:22.987 --> 01:19:25.512
- <i>I mean, that's the truth. </i>
- <i>Yeah. </i>

01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:30.050
- Hey, you guys, have you seen X anywhere?
- No.

01:19:30.128 --> 01:19:34.531
Hey, look who showed up.

01:19:34.599 --> 01:19:37.397
I didn't know you fellas had
enough bus fare to make it over here.

01:19:37.468 --> 01:19:39.698
- Really?
- Yeah. Did you steal a car or something?

01:19:39.771 --> 01:19:43.298
Actually, we rode over here on your
mama's back, and, damn, she's strong.

01:19:43.374 --> 01:19:46.605
Oh, whoa, whoa.

01:19:46.678 --> 01:19:51.411
- Somebody got some new skates, huh?
We'd better be scared now, fellas.
- Yeah.

01:19:51.482 --> 01:19:54.576
And check out
their cute little iron-ons.

01:19:54.652 --> 01:19:57.052
Did your mommy do this for-

01:20:03.995 --> 01:20:06.896
What is that?

01:20:06.965 --> 01:20:09.593
Makes no sense. Anyways, look.
Boo, remember the cross.

01:20:11.369 --> 01:20:14.930
Didn't I just tell you how stunning you are?

01:20:15.006 --> 01:20:17.099
- You gonna mess up our-
- X. X.

01:20:17.175 --> 01:20:20.110
- What's up, man?
- There's your girl.

01:20:20.178 --> 01:20:23.739
<i>Sweetness is all over that. </i>

01:20:23.815 --> 01:20:29.048
See that, X? Chicks only go for the athletes
or the pretty boys with good hair.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.884
- Not like you, Naps.
- Right. Right. What?

01:20:31.956 --> 01:20:33.947
<i> It's true. </i>

01:20:34.025 --> 01:20:37.051
<i>Not all chicks. </i>

01:20:37.128 --> 01:20:40.655
Whoo.

01:20:40.732 --> 01:20:45.760
I like ugly boys. Why you think
I hang around y'all?

01:20:45.837 --> 01:20:50.536
And stop saying "chicks. "
It's demeaning.

01:20:50.608 --> 01:20:53.406
Damn!

01:20:53.478 --> 01:20:55.469
Marry me?

01:20:55.546 --> 01:20:59.880
<i>Tori, good gosh, girl. </i>
<i>You look</i>-

01:20:59.951 --> 01:21:04.251
Cute? Fine?
Beyond description?

01:21:04.322 --> 01:21:06.790
- You do.
- And then some.

01:21:10.161 --> 01:21:12.152
Spit it out.

01:21:12.230 --> 01:21:16.098
I know your big ol' rock head
has something smart to say.

01:21:16.167 --> 01:21:20.695
Actually, I came up here to say
that you look really beautiful.

01:21:20.772 --> 01:21:23.536
- I mean, I've never seen you
look this way before.
- Wow. Wow.

01:21:23.608 --> 01:21:25.633
I mean it.

01:21:27.211 --> 01:21:29.975
- Thank you.
- Psych!

01:21:30.048 --> 01:21:32.608
Shut up!

01:21:32.683 --> 01:21:37.643
No. You need to put the braces back on.

01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:48.831
Dad, what are y'all doin' here?

01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:50.993
What do you mean, what are we doin' here?
I'm here to watch you win.

01:21:51.069 --> 01:21:54.698
And I'm also here to watch
your father fall flat on his butt.

01:21:54.772 --> 01:21:57.832
<i>All group skaters report to center floor. </i>

01:21:57.909 --> 01:22:01.367
All group skaters report to center floor.

01:22:01.446 --> 01:22:04.609
- I guess that's us.
- <i> Hey, come here. </i>

01:22:04.682 --> 01:22:08.379
- Yeah?
- Go get 'em, son.

01:22:10.955 --> 01:22:13.116
- Yeah.
- <i> Dad. </i>

01:22:13.191 --> 01:22:16.922
<i>Yeah, yeah. Enough with the family</i>
<i>reunion stuff. Let's roll!</i>

01:22:16.994 --> 01:22:20.430
- Boo, you got the music, right?
- Come on, man. You know I got it.

01:22:20.498 --> 01:22:24.298
Chic's "Le Freak. " These cats around here
don't know nothin' about this.

01:22:24.368 --> 01:22:29.271
- Then let's go. Where we from, y'all?
- South Side. Let's roll.

01:22:33.778 --> 01:22:39.546
Whoo, whoo! What's happening?
What's happening? What's happening?

01:22:39.617 --> 01:22:42.677
Oh-whoa. What's happening?

01:22:42.753 --> 01:22:46.484
I wanna say hello,
all you silky smooth skaters.

01:22:46.557 --> 01:22:49.754
<i>Hello, and welcome</i>
<i>to the sixth annual skate-off. </i>

01:22:49.827 --> 01:22:54.059
I'm D.J. Johnny Feelgood,
and, ladies, I do.

01:22:54.132 --> 01:22:57.329
I would like to welcome everybody.
I am presiding over the festivities.

01:22:57.401 --> 01:23:03.101
I will be judging the contest,
along with my-Where's my aphrodisiac?

01:23:03.174 --> 01:23:05.608
Where is she?
Oh, there she is.

01:23:05.676 --> 01:23:10.272
<i>Give it up for my lady. </i>
<i>Come on over. Cocoa on wheels. </i>

01:23:10.348 --> 01:23:13.249
Oh. Oh. That's
what I'm talkin' about.

01:23:13.317 --> 01:23:15.649
Ain't nothin' like a little sugar
to get it started. See that sugar?

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:20.748
All right.
Now, skaters, you will be competing for this.

01:23:20.825 --> 01:23:26.024
Uh-huh. $500 and-

01:23:26.097 --> 01:23:29.294
and the chance
to get the braggin' rights...

01:23:29.367 --> 01:23:34.430
to call yourself the baddest skaters
that Sweetwater has to offer.

01:23:34.505 --> 01:23:39.704
All right. Uh-huh. But, but, but...

01:23:39.777 --> 01:23:43.406
don't get too happy, 'cause, you see, those
bragging rights are currently being held...

01:23:43.481 --> 01:23:48.214
<i>by the Sweetwater Rollers</i>
<i>and their leader, my man... </i>

01:23:48.286 --> 01:23:52.882
my mellow, Sweetness!

01:23:57.061 --> 01:24:01.225
<i>Let's hear it for the Sweetwater Rollers</i>
<i>and Sweetness!</i>

01:24:01.299 --> 01:24:05.429
<i>Pimpin' it out on the skates. </i>

01:24:05.503 --> 01:24:08.995
Oh, boy.
So that's Sweetness, huh?

01:24:09.073 --> 01:24:11.064
Yep.

01:24:11.142 --> 01:24:16.273
Daddy, I love him.
Hi, Sweetness!

01:24:16.347 --> 01:24:18.645
Oh, boy.

01:24:18.716 --> 01:24:21.583
<i> Come on, ladies. </i>
<i>Let's hear it one more time for Sweetness!</i>

01:24:25.056 --> 01:24:29.925
Let me break this down for you.
Here's how it's gonna happen.

01:24:29.994 --> 01:24:34.226
<i>All teams will have four minutes to skate your</i>
<i>routines, but y'all don't wanna hear me talk. </i>

01:24:34.298 --> 01:24:38.496
<i>Y'all don't wanna hear this smick-smack. </i>
<i>Let's get this mother-sucker started!</i>

01:24:38.569 --> 01:24:42.437
Let's jam!

01:25:22.113 --> 01:25:25.048
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:25:45.002 --> 01:25:47.266
Break-dance! Break-dance!

01:25:58.983 --> 01:26:03.283
All right! That's what
I'm talkin' about right there.

01:26:03.354 --> 01:26:05.879
That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:26:05.956 --> 01:26:10.325
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together</i>
<i>for Sweetness and the Sweetwater Rollers. </i>

01:26:10.394 --> 01:26:12.862
<i>Sweetness!</i>

01:26:26.677 --> 01:26:29.441
That's our song!
They're usin' our song!

01:26:29.513 --> 01:26:32.107
- But they can't do that.
- Well, they doin' it.

01:26:32.183 --> 01:26:35.812
This is jacked up.
Our whole routine is to this song.

01:26:35.886 --> 01:26:37.820
Not anymore.

01:28:31.935 --> 01:28:35.837
<i> Put your hands together</i>
<i>for Sweetness and the Sweetwater Rollers!</i>

01:28:35.906 --> 01:28:38.966
They're so good,
I don't need to see anything else.

01:28:39.043 --> 01:28:41.876
That's it. I'm gonna leave. I'm done.
I'm gonna retire. I'm gonna give it up.

01:28:41.945 --> 01:28:45.278
<i>I'm done. Baby, stop me, baby. </i>
<i>Stop me, baby. Stop me. </i>

01:28:45.349 --> 01:28:47.317
- Marvin Gaye?
- No.

01:28:47.384 --> 01:28:49.352
- Bee Gees?
- My cousin got that record.

01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:51.354
What we gonna do?

01:28:51.422 --> 01:28:53.890
- I don't know. I can't be the only person-
- You the leader, man.

01:28:53.957 --> 01:28:59.418
Ooh, ooh, ooh. I got it. I got it.

01:28:59.496 --> 01:29:02.397
- Got what, Naps?
- The perfect song to skate to.

01:29:02.466 --> 01:29:06.232
<i>Trust me. I'm clutch. </i>

01:29:07.871 --> 01:29:12.774
Have fun, Garden Boys.

01:29:14.978 --> 01:29:17.208
You dig?

01:29:17.281 --> 01:29:20.717
- Don't worry about them, Mike.
- The routine we have
is not gonna match the song.

01:29:20.784 --> 01:29:23.651
- <i>Doesn't matter. </i>
- <i>I don't trust Naps. </i>
- Think positive, okay?

01:29:23.721 --> 01:29:26.485
- <i>We good?</i>
- Yeah. We good.

01:29:28.892 --> 01:29:33.659
All right, now, look, fellas. This is not
no time for no pity party, okay?

01:29:33.731 --> 01:29:36.029
We gotta do
what we came here to do.

01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:38.227
It's time to put up or shut up.

01:29:39.703 --> 01:29:42.604
Now, what we gonna do, hmm?

01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:48.803
- Put up.
- Put up.

01:29:48.879 --> 01:29:51.439
- Put up.
- That's what I like to hear.

01:29:51.515 --> 01:29:54.609
Put my foot right up their asses!

01:29:57.221 --> 01:30:00.987
Close enough. Y'all, let's win this
for the Gardens, all right?

01:30:01.058 --> 01:30:04.619
Now, rounding out
our group skate competition...

01:30:04.695 --> 01:30:07.459
representin' the South Side-

01:30:07.531 --> 01:30:10.989
<i>Please put your hands together</i>
<i>for the Garden Boys. </i>

01:30:11.068 --> 01:30:16.836
- X. X!
- The dude is bad.

01:30:23.347 --> 01:30:25.679
Good luck.

01:31:27.311 --> 01:31:29.404
Oh, y'all clappin' now, huh?
Yeah. A'ight.

01:31:32.416 --> 01:31:36.182
That's kind of nice right there.

01:31:51.201 --> 01:31:52.725
All right now.

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.944
Yeah!
The boys from South Side!

01:32:51.862 --> 01:32:55.127
<i>Everybody, big round of applause</i>
<i>for the Garden Boys!</i>

01:32:55.198 --> 01:32:59.134
- <i> You'd better</i>
<i>clap for the Garden Boys. </i>

01:32:59.202 --> 01:33:01.466
Yeah. All right. Yeah.

01:33:06.777 --> 01:33:12.238
Yes. Now, that's what
I call a competition.

01:33:12.316 --> 01:33:16.844
Oh! All right,
young bloods. All right.

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:20.549
Let me have all of our group skaters
out here on the floor.

01:33:20.624 --> 01:33:23.184
Bring yourselves out here.
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:26.991
<i>a big round of applause</i>
<i>for all these skaters. </i>

01:33:27.064 --> 01:33:31.228
All these skaters so beautiful,
don't you agree?

01:33:31.301 --> 01:33:34.896
<i>Now, folks,</i>
<i>me and Mrs. Feelgood... </i>

01:33:34.972 --> 01:33:36.997
we had a time
decidin' on the winner...

01:33:37.074 --> 01:33:41.135
because this was
the fiercest competition...

01:33:41.211 --> 01:33:43.736
that Sweetwater has ever seen.

01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:49.078
So, without any further delay...

01:33:49.152 --> 01:33:54.715
<i>the 1978 Sweetwater Skate-off</i>
<i>champs are</i>-

01:33:54.791 --> 01:33:57.658
Drumroll, please-

01:33:57.728 --> 01:33:59.958
Oh!

01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:03.966
It's a draw.

01:34:04.034 --> 01:34:09.438
<i>The Sweetwater Rollers</i>
<i>and the Garden Boys. </i>

01:34:14.478 --> 01:34:16.673
Yeah. That's my boy.

01:34:19.316 --> 01:34:21.716
We did it. We did it. We did it.

01:34:21.785 --> 01:34:25.915
A draw? A draw?
I don't draw. I win.

01:34:25.989 --> 01:34:29.049
Not today, Mr. -
Sweetness!

01:34:29.126 --> 01:34:32.186
How some South Side garbage
gonna tie with us? This can't happen.

01:34:32.262 --> 01:34:35.527
<i>Look, man. You guys did good today. </i>
<i>Look, just chill out. </i>

01:34:35.599 --> 01:34:41.003
You chill out, punk. You sorry sucker,
I'm the king of this here floor, you dig?

01:34:41.071 --> 01:34:44.871
I ain't about to let some ghetto
group from the hood destroy
the house that Sweetness built.

01:34:44.941 --> 01:34:49.071
You can believe that.
We need to have a skate-off.

01:34:51.681 --> 01:34:54.479
Me and you.
Winner take all.

01:34:58.789 --> 01:35:02.190
Nah. That's okay. We just gonna
take half of our winnings...

01:35:02.259 --> 01:35:05.592
and hustle back
to the poor South Side.

01:35:05.662 --> 01:35:08.460
You keep the trophy, chump.

01:35:08.532 --> 01:35:12.628
- What? You scared?
- <i> Whoo. </i>

01:35:12.702 --> 01:35:16.263
- Whoo.
- <i>Scared that you don't belong over here?</i>

01:35:16.339 --> 01:35:18.933
That you are beneath us?

01:35:20.377 --> 01:35:24.905
No. See, I'm just tryin'
to help you save face...

01:35:24.981 --> 01:35:27.973
because I would hate to see you
get spanked in front of all your fans.

01:35:31.588 --> 01:35:36.992
Young blood, you couldn't spank me
if your hands were glued to my ass.

01:35:40.931 --> 01:35:44.628
My hands glued to your ass?

01:35:44.701 --> 01:35:47.932
I don't know. That sounds
a little sweet to me, Sweetness.

01:35:48.004 --> 01:35:52.498
Ha!

01:35:52.576 --> 01:35:56.910
- Now, let's skate.
- You just bought yourself an ass whooping.

01:35:56.980 --> 01:36:00.438
- Winner take all. No falls. Bet?
- Bet.

01:36:00.517 --> 01:36:03.611
Let's do this, Johnny.

01:36:03.687 --> 01:36:08.989
All right now. Sounds like
we got ourselves a showdown!

01:36:09.059 --> 01:36:14.156
- Come on, son.
- We got it now. We gonna win, no matter what.

01:36:17.767 --> 01:36:22.204
<i> Now, y'all know the rules. </i>
<i>This is last man standing. </i>

01:36:22.272 --> 01:36:24.866
<i>So I'm about to get it</i>
<i>a little warmed up for y'all... </i>

01:36:24.941 --> 01:36:28.638
<i>with a little "Fire. "</i>

01:36:28.778 --> 01:36:31.212
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:36:35.452 --> 01:36:38.319
Do your thing! Come on!

01:36:55.839 --> 01:37:00.276
<i> Smooth! Smooth!</i>

01:37:00.343 --> 01:37:04.905
<i>Somebody needs to arrest</i>
<i>that man for being so smooth!</i>

01:37:04.981 --> 01:37:06.505
It's on you.

01:37:26.336 --> 01:37:28.896
<i>There you go, young blood. </i>

01:37:34.611 --> 01:37:36.875
Whoo!

01:37:39.883 --> 01:37:41.748
Oh!

01:37:46.223 --> 01:37:48.418
<i>All right, little man. </i>
<i>All right, little man. </i>

01:37:55.298 --> 01:37:56.492
Yes!

01:38:17.254 --> 01:38:20.155
<i>Sweetness is showin' why he is the man</i>-

01:38:20.223 --> 01:38:24.455
<i>a double spin down to his knees!</i>

01:38:32.969 --> 01:38:35.870
<i>I can't take no more of this!</i>
<i>You're hot-hot!</i>

01:38:37.741 --> 01:38:41.802
A near miss. Almost a collision.
A roller skate to the head is not a good thing.

01:38:41.878 --> 01:38:45.507
<i>Remember that. Remember that. </i>

01:38:45.582 --> 01:38:48.380
<i>Keep it goin'. Keep it goin'.</i>

01:38:48.451 --> 01:38:51.181
Yeah!

01:38:51.254 --> 01:38:53.916
So you think
you're pretty good, huh?

01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:57.357
Well, I got something for you.

01:39:06.936 --> 01:39:10.929
<i>Yeah! Get it on!</i>

01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:30.081
Hold up. You'd better get out of here.

01:39:36.833 --> 01:39:38.164
Come on, son.

01:40:06.296 --> 01:40:09.265
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

01:40:52.509 --> 01:40:54.739
Yeah!

01:40:54.811 --> 01:40:58.474
Hey, yo. Where'd
you learn those moves?

01:41:40.223 --> 01:41:42.214
This is for you, Mom.

01:41:54.204 --> 01:41:56.866
Get him, X!

01:41:56.940 --> 01:42:00.637
<i>We got the young blood</i>
<i>from the Garden Boys doin' his thing!</i>

01:42:23.066 --> 01:42:25.534
Ooh! That's it.

01:42:28.938 --> 01:42:31.640
That's our man.

01:42:59.668 --> 01:43:02.899
Whoo.

01:43:02.971 --> 01:43:05.633
Whoo!

01:43:36.204 --> 01:43:39.605
What's he doin'?

01:43:51.486 --> 01:43:54.284
Oh, no.

01:44:27.555 --> 01:44:32.492
<i>And the winner is... Sweetness!</i>

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:35.051
Yeah!

01:44:40.468 --> 01:44:44.097
<i>X, man. X.</i>

01:44:44.172 --> 01:44:48.040
- Wake up, man.
- X!

01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:51.545
<i>Hey, man. You better not be dead. </i>

01:44:51.613 --> 01:44:54.446
Hey, Boo, give him mouth-to-mouth.

01:44:54.516 --> 01:44:57.007
- Nah.
- X.

01:44:57.085 --> 01:44:58.848
- X.
- X.

01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:02.686
Hey, if you dead,
let me get your Atari.

01:45:02.757 --> 01:45:08.457
- Can you hear me?
- <i>Hey, man, please don't be dead, man. </i>

01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:12.557
All the stuff we done went together.

01:45:12.634 --> 01:45:16.161
Man, that routine was great.

01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:24.107
But that triple lutz thing you tried-
probably shouldn't have done that.

01:45:24.179 --> 01:45:27.148
<i>Son?</i>

01:45:27.215 --> 01:45:31.618
Xavier, are you okay?
Xavier, wake up. Are you all right?

01:45:32.821 --> 01:45:35.551
What happened?

01:45:35.623 --> 01:45:38.888
You happened.

01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:43.624
My boy. Come on.
Help me get him up.

01:45:43.698 --> 01:45:46.929
- Messed up your 'fro and everything.
- I'm proud of you, son.

01:45:47.001 --> 01:45:49.094
Thanks, Dad.

01:46:04.018 --> 01:46:06.782
Yeah. You did it.

01:46:06.855 --> 01:46:08.982
- X, X, X...
- Come on, man.

01:46:09.057 --> 01:46:11.890
<i>X, X, X, X, X.</i>

01:46:24.339 --> 01:46:26.807
Um, look, about the other day-

01:46:31.579 --> 01:46:36.243
Hey, hey. Come on.
Hey. Whose daughter is this?

01:46:36.317 --> 01:46:39.878
Let 'em go. Come on.

01:46:39.954 --> 01:46:42.684
Whoo-hoo. Hey, Tori.

01:46:42.757 --> 01:46:47.524
- Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Turner. Oops.
- <i>Tori. </i>

01:46:47.595 --> 01:46:50.689
Let 'em go. Let 'em go.
Let 'em go.

01:46:50.765 --> 01:46:53.256
Hey, man.

01:46:54.335 --> 01:46:56.769
Let's go.

01:47:00.208 --> 01:47:04.872
<i> All right, all you rollers</i>
<i>out there, this is an all-skate. </i>

01:47:04.946 --> 01:47:09.751
I repeat: This is an all-skate.
