WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:01.901
This is the

00:01.901 --> 00:02.268
This is
the Evergreen forest.

00:03.803 --> 00:06.206
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:08.108 --> 00:10.410
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.045
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.380 --> 00:15.482
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.483 --> 00:17.484
Yikes!

00:18.184 --> 00:19.386
Yaaaah...

00:22.455 --> 00:23.790
Yeaaaah!

00:23.790 --> 00:26.726
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.403
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:38.038 --> 00:39.406
Cyril Sneer!

00:43.009 --> 00:45.345
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.079 --> 00:47.647
the Raccoons!!

00:47.647 --> 00:50.183
♪ (show theme music) ♪

00:59.059 --> 01:00.060
Cedric!!!

01:01.861 --> 01:04.230
Cedriiiic!!
Cedriiiic!!

01:04.230 --> 01:07.767
Aaah! I don't think
I can make it!

01:10.070 --> 01:12.739
The piranha,
they're getting closer!

01:12.739 --> 01:15.542
Just as it looked
like we've outraced

01:15.542 --> 01:17.610
the ravenous piranha,

01:17.610 --> 01:20.313
our look took a
turn for the worse!

01:21.548 --> 01:23.216
What happens next, Cedric?

01:23.216 --> 01:25.785
Giant
crocodiles slithered

01:25.785 --> 01:28.154
from the banks
of the Orinoco River

01:28.154 --> 01:30.356
and scythed toward us.

01:30.356 --> 01:31.624
Oh no!!

01:31.624 --> 01:33.993
Not crocodiles!

01:34.694 --> 01:37.664
Aaah!

01:40.633 --> 01:43.169
Uuh! Thanks, trusty guide!

01:43.169 --> 01:44.771
Uh-uh-ehm,

01:44.771 --> 01:48.541
As we left one
deadly danger behind,

01:48.541 --> 01:52.212
we knew that even
greater peril lay in our path

01:52.212 --> 01:54.948
to the lost city of Pongo.

01:54.948 --> 01:59.085
Boy, can that Sir Malcolm
Havelock write a story!

01:59.085 --> 02:01.621
It's just like you're
right there with him.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.557
Wouldn't that be something
to meet him, Cedric?

02:04.557 --> 02:08.261
The greatest explorer
in the world!

02:08.261 --> 02:09.829
Bert, look!

02:09.829 --> 02:11.631
Oh, is he in trouble?

02:17.871 --> 02:20.006
Sir Malcolm Havelock:
Lend us a hand, chaps?

02:20.006 --> 02:24.110
Hey, you're...
you're Sir Malcolm Havelock!

02:24.110 --> 02:26.813
Sir Malcolm:
Of course I am, old chap.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.481
The one and only.

02:28.481 --> 02:29.682
Wow!

02:32.218 --> 02:34.154
Well, here we are.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.589
This is my bedroom, Sir Malcolm.

02:36.589 --> 02:39.492
You can have the top bunk.
It's got the best view!

02:39.492 --> 02:41.161
Sir Malcolm: Thanks
awfully, old boy,

02:41.161 --> 02:44.230
but... I prefer
the lower bunk.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.965
Sir Malcolm: Uh-aaah!

02:45.965 --> 02:48.535
Oh, leaping leopards,
what's that?

02:48.535 --> 02:50.670
It's just
Broo, Sir Malcolm.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.805
Sir Malcolm: Dogs? Ugh!

02:52.805 --> 02:54.174
Never trusted them,

02:54.174 --> 02:56.476
since I was trapped by a pack of

02:56.476 --> 02:59.312
wild dingos in the Outback.

02:59.312 --> 03:01.481
Ohh.. well, okay,

03:01.481 --> 03:03.283
I-I'll put him outside then.

03:04.284 --> 03:07.353
Sorry little buddy, you're
gonna have to stay outside

03:07.353 --> 03:08.688
while Sir Malcolm's here.

03:12.659 --> 03:15.628
Sir Malcolm: Bert, I've
been all over the world

03:15.762 --> 03:18.164
and I can categorically state

03:18.164 --> 03:21.968
that these are the best
peanut butter sandwiches

03:21.968 --> 03:23.603
I've ever eaten!

03:23.603 --> 03:26.506
Ah, it's just a talent!

03:26.506 --> 03:28.875
Sir Malcolm: No, seriously!

03:28.875 --> 03:33.179
Why, if you were along to
cook on one of my expeditions,

03:33.179 --> 03:36.716
I'd be a happier
explorer, Bert, old man.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.886
Gosh! Gooosh!!!

03:39.886 --> 03:44.290
Sir Malcolm: By the way,
do you know Lady Baden-Baden?

03:44.290 --> 03:47.393
(giggles) Everybody
knows Lady Baden-Baden.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.028
Sir Malcolm: Ohh, jolly good.

03:49.028 --> 03:53.066
She's invited me to give a
luncheon address to her club.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.868
Then I'll be signing some books.

03:55.868 --> 03:59.339
Here's my latest.
He-he, have you read it?

03:59.339 --> 04:02.342
Tales from the Adventurers Club.

04:02.342 --> 04:04.978
Of course I have!
What a story!

04:04.978 --> 04:07.847
I love the part when you
climb the giant Redondo tree

04:07.847 --> 04:10.383
and then the
helicopter. And there's...

04:10.383 --> 04:13.152
Sir Malcolm: Yes, yes,
I wrote it, old man.

04:13.152 --> 04:15.688
Do you know we got
our own club, Sir Malcolm,

04:15.688 --> 04:17.056
haven't we Cedric?

04:17.056 --> 04:19.859
Sir Malcolm: Well then,
we must visit it, mustn't we?

04:19.859 --> 04:23.496
Oh, I say nothing like
sitting on the club veranda

04:23.496 --> 04:25.231
in the afternoon, eh what?

04:25.231 --> 04:28.568
Bert? Why was
Broo locked outside?!

04:28.568 --> 04:31.037
Ralph, Melissa,
prepare to be shocked,

04:31.037 --> 04:34.007
surprised a-a-and amazed!

04:34.007 --> 04:36.276
I'd like to present to you

04:36.276 --> 04:39.379
the greatest explorer
in the world!

04:39.379 --> 04:42.081
Sir Malcolm Havelock!

04:42.081 --> 04:43.082
We heard you were coming

04:43.082 --> 04:45.251
to the Evergreen
Forest, Sir Malcolm,

04:45.251 --> 04:46.953
It's an honor to meet you.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.621
I hope
you enjoy your stay.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.224
Sir Malcolm: Yes, well, ehm.
Yeah, thank you.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.427
The Pigs: Boss, boss!!!

04:54.427 --> 04:56.462
Guess who's in town?

04:56.462 --> 04:59.065
Pig 1: Sir Malcolm Havelock!

04:59.065 --> 05:01.901
So what?? Does that mean
you have to dress like

05:01.901 --> 05:03.803
rejects from a jungle picture?

05:03.803 --> 05:07.073
Pig 2: But boss, he's the
greatest explorer in the world!

05:07.073 --> 05:09.542
Pig 2: We've read all his books!

05:09.542 --> 05:11.110
Pig 3: He's discovered
more treasure,

05:11.110 --> 05:13.646
than any 10 explorers
put together.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.915
I don't care if he...
treasure?

05:15.915 --> 05:19.118
Pig 1: Oh yes, boss! There's
The Treasure of Kalakoko.

05:19.118 --> 05:21.220
And then there's
these Benin Dodo.

05:21.220 --> 05:22.288
Oh, that was a big one.

05:22.288 --> 05:23.556
Oh, and look!

05:23.556 --> 05:27.560
The Fortunate Fando Lolo Lolo.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.296
Hmmm.. treasure, eh?

05:30.296 --> 05:33.800
Ha! Old treasure.

05:33.800 --> 05:37.470
There it is,
Sir Malcolm. Our club.

05:37.470 --> 05:38.671
Sir Malcolm: Ouh!

05:38.671 --> 05:42.108
You should have seen
it before we fixed it up.

05:42.108 --> 05:45.845
And this is our raft,
the Companion Ship.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.081
Hey, this probably
reminds you of the time

05:48.081 --> 05:51.484
you went up the Limpopo by raft,
right Sir Malcolm?

05:51.484 --> 05:55.421
Sir Malcolm: Uh-ah...
yes rather yeah...

05:55.421 --> 05:57.990
That was quite an
expedition, Sir Malcolm!

05:57.990 --> 06:00.360
Are you planning any
more like that one?

06:00.360 --> 06:03.363
Sir Malcolm: Well...
uh-ehm, ehm.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.765
Confidentially, oh boy,

06:05.765 --> 06:07.300
I'm planning to locate

06:07.300 --> 06:10.036
the lost city of Lingodo,

06:10.036 --> 06:12.538
and the treasure of Marbu

06:12.538 --> 06:15.108
that's supposed to be
hidden beneath it.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.110
That's fantastic!

06:17.110 --> 06:20.713
Boy! What I wouldn't give
to go with you, Sir Malcolm.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.349
Sir Malcolm:
Well, it's not all fun.

06:23.349 --> 06:27.653
Eh, excuse me Bert,
what are you doing there?

06:27.653 --> 06:30.156
Oh, I thought you might
like to go for a spin

06:30.156 --> 06:31.758
on my raft, Sir Malcolm.

06:31.758 --> 06:34.026
Sir Malcolm: Oh,
leaping leopards, old man!

06:34.026 --> 06:37.063
Uh-oh-eh!
It's Wednesday, yes!

06:37.063 --> 06:39.632
And well, all adventurers know

06:39.632 --> 06:43.369
that the uh, the, the,
the Wizards of Wendigo

06:43.369 --> 06:47.907
say that it's dashed bad
luck to raft on Wednesdays.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.710
Yes! Uh, oh my goodness.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.947
Sir Malcolm:

06:55.715 --> 06:58.384
Broo, you
shouldn't do that!

06:58.384 --> 07:00.753
Now look what you
made Sir Malcolm do!

07:00.753 --> 07:04.390
Bert, quick!
He's drowning, Bert!!

07:06.292 --> 07:11.097
Sir Malcolm:

07:11.097 --> 07:12.532
Ooh!

07:12.532 --> 07:14.600
Certainly took your time

07:14.600 --> 07:17.537
pulling me out, old boy!

07:17.537 --> 07:19.071
Sorry, Sir Malcolm.

07:19.071 --> 07:20.773
B-bu-but I, I just thought...

07:20.773 --> 07:22.742
We thought
you could swim!

07:22.742 --> 07:26.913
After all, you did outrace the
piranhas and the crocodiles

07:26.913 --> 07:28.548
in the Orinoco River?

07:28.548 --> 07:30.516
Uhm, didn't you?

07:30.516 --> 07:34.153
Sir Malcolm: Uh-oh-ehm,
well, of course I did!

07:34.153 --> 07:35.922
But, emh...

07:35.922 --> 07:39.258
That was before I was
shot in the leg...

07:39.258 --> 07:41.461
...by poachers.

07:41.461 --> 07:45.064
Ohh, the old leg is full
of lead now. Do you see?

07:45.064 --> 07:47.834
It's not something
I like to talk about.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.001
Brrr, egrr!

07:49.001 --> 07:52.638
But, you'd be a good man
on an expedition, Bert.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.440
You think on your feet!

07:54.440 --> 07:57.310
Yes, indeed. A fine man!

07:57.310 --> 08:00.813
Gee! Thanks, Sir Malcolm!

08:04.484 --> 08:07.453
Sir Malcolm: And as we
crested the last peak,

08:07.453 --> 08:09.021
we saw below us

08:09.021 --> 08:12.959
the fabulous lost city
of Koraqua.

08:12.959 --> 08:16.496
Aaah!
set like a jewel
in green velvet.

08:17.897 --> 08:20.666
It took 12 weeks to
recover the treasure!

08:20.666 --> 08:23.669
Aaah!
And here I am with some of it.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.638
This picture, of
course, was taken

08:25.638 --> 08:28.674
at the Museum of
Modern Archaeology.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.810
Sir Malcolm: Thank you.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.915
Lady Baden-Baden: Uuh,
what an inspiration you are

08:35.915 --> 08:37.984
to all of us, Sir Malcolm!

08:37.984 --> 08:40.353
I do hope you stay and answer

08:40.353 --> 08:43.489
some questions
from our audience.

08:43.489 --> 08:46.759
Ohh, there's one now.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.160
Yes?

08:48.160 --> 08:50.296
Ever get trapped in quicksand,
Sir Malcolm?

08:50.296 --> 08:52.632
Sir Malcolm: Ummm...
not permanently.

08:52.632 --> 08:53.866
Next?

08:54.634 --> 08:56.669
Did you ever get
lost, Sir Malcolm?

08:56.669 --> 08:59.005
Sir Malcolm:
Not permanently.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.172
Next?

09:00.172 --> 09:02.742
Those were terrific
slides, Sir Malcolm.

09:02.742 --> 09:06.412
Uhm.. do you have
any of you at Koraqua?

09:06.412 --> 09:08.381
Sir Malcolm: W-we-well,
um, I-I did!

09:08.381 --> 09:11.484
Yeah, but jungle
mould got to them!

09:11.484 --> 09:14.921
Ah! Dashed stuff, that
jungle mold, you know?

09:14.921 --> 09:16.322
Next?

09:16.322 --> 09:19.492
Are you planning anymore
expeditions, Sir Malcolm?

09:19.492 --> 09:23.129
Sir Malcolm: I have no
definite plans at the moment.

09:23.129 --> 09:26.365
Aaah, don't be
so modest, Sir Malcolm!

09:26.365 --> 09:29.902
Hey, tell us about your
plans to find the treasure

09:29.902 --> 09:32.872
in the lost city of Lingodo.

09:32.872 --> 09:36.642
Sir Malcolm: Well, t-th-that
would be a little premature.

09:36.642 --> 09:41.080
Hey, after all these things are
dreadfully expensive, old boy.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.049
Heh, you need all
sorts of equipment,

09:43.049 --> 09:45.518
rafts and tents, rope,

09:45.518 --> 09:47.653
soda water, ice,

09:47.653 --> 09:50.890
Oh, it could take me
years to raise the money!

09:52.592 --> 09:54.894
More like minutes,
Sir Malcolm!

09:58.130 --> 10:01.534
I'm here to tell you
that I, Cyril Sneer,

10:01.534 --> 10:04.904
will finance Sir Malcolm's
next expedition!

10:04.904 --> 10:07.940
It's just my small contribution

10:07.940 --> 10:10.176
towards the exploration of this

10:10.176 --> 10:12.745
wide and mysterious
world of ours.

10:12.745 --> 10:15.281
For the betterment of humanity.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.184
Of course, the treasure
has nothing to do with.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.257
With my money and your
sense of direction,

10:25.257 --> 10:27.126
there's nothing we can't do!

10:27.126 --> 10:30.730
Sir Malcolm: But, uh-eh-emm,
this is so sudden, Mr. Sneer.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.633
I.. you know nothing about me.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.702
I'm an excellent
judge of character.

10:36.702 --> 10:40.806
I know you'll bring the treasure
of Maboo back from Lingodo!

10:40.806 --> 10:43.976
Here! Sign this!
It's just a formality.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.245
My standard expedition contract.

10:47.413 --> 10:48.481
Thank you.

10:49.815 --> 10:54.587
Just what are you,
pinhead porkers doing?

10:54.587 --> 10:57.490
Oh! We wanna go on
the expedition, boss!

10:58.557 --> 11:01.260
Pig 2: We'd make great porters,
Sir Malcolm.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.162
You'll only be going,
if Sir Malcolm needs

11:03.162 --> 11:05.531
a new pair of pigskin
hiking boots!

11:05.531 --> 11:07.133
Get dessert!!

11:07.133 --> 11:10.336
Do you plan to wait
until the rainy season is over

11:10.336 --> 11:13.472
before you start for
Lingodo, Sir Malcolm?

11:13.472 --> 11:16.609
Sir Malcolm: Oh-eh-ugh,
of course, old boy, yes.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.545
You can't travel
in the rainy season.

11:19.545 --> 11:22.948
Oh no! That ends in.. um, May.

11:22.948 --> 11:25.818
I thought
the rain started in May.

11:25.818 --> 11:27.286
Sir Malcolm:
Oh yes, that's right.

11:27.286 --> 11:29.188
How could I have forgotten?

11:29.188 --> 11:33.292
I'm asking myself the
same question, Sir Malcolm.

11:33.292 --> 11:37.363
To Sir Malcolm,
and the lost city of Lingodo!

11:37.363 --> 11:40.599
And of course, the
treasure of Baboo.

11:43.335 --> 11:45.838
Bert's certainly
gone a bit overboard

11:45.838 --> 11:47.773
on the story about Sir Malcolm.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.709
It reads like one of his books.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.845
Good story, but very few facts.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.447
What do you mean, Ralph?

11:54.447 --> 11:57.016
Well, I've tried
to find supporting evidence

11:57.016 --> 11:59.085
for some of
Sir Malcolm's claims,

11:59.085 --> 12:01.487
but there's just no proof!

12:01.487 --> 12:03.689
And some of the
places he talks about,

12:03.689 --> 12:05.691
aren't even on the map.

12:05.691 --> 12:08.160
Of course
they're not on the maps!

12:08.160 --> 12:10.429
They're lost cities, Cedric!

12:10.429 --> 12:12.798
I'm sorry, Bert,
but I just can't

12:12.798 --> 12:15.201
print this story
without better proof.

12:15.201 --> 12:19.638
Your only source is
Sir Malcolm and his books.

12:19.638 --> 12:22.241
Well, what more
do ya' need?

12:22.241 --> 12:24.710
We need
eyewitness reports, Bert.

12:24.710 --> 12:27.880
Ah! You want
eyewitness reports?

12:27.880 --> 12:31.217
I'll get ya' eye
witness reports!!

12:31.217 --> 12:32.685
How, Bert?

12:32.685 --> 12:35.187
I'll go with Sir Malcolm

12:35.187 --> 12:38.557
on his expedition to the
lost city of Lingodo!

12:42.228 --> 12:43.429
You know
it's tough packing

12:43.429 --> 12:45.131
for a trip like
this one, Cedric?

12:45.131 --> 12:48.234
I mean, I don't even know
how long I'll be gone.

12:48.234 --> 12:51.170
It could be weeks! Months!!

12:51.437 --> 12:52.705
Years!!!

12:52.705 --> 12:54.406
Uh, what do you think?

12:54.406 --> 12:56.275
Squash or tennis?

12:56.275 --> 12:59.378
I wish you'd think
seriously about this, Bert.

12:59.378 --> 13:01.046
Yeah, you're right, Cedric

13:01.046 --> 13:02.681
The tennis racket.

13:02.681 --> 13:04.617
Well, I've
been checking on this,

13:04.617 --> 13:07.853
and I'd really hate
to see you make a mistake.

13:07.853 --> 13:10.055
Ah, you're right, Cedric,
I'll take 'em both.

13:10.055 --> 13:11.457
No, Bert!

13:11.457 --> 13:13.592
I mean, I'm a bit worried about

13:13.592 --> 13:15.594
you going with Sir Malcolm.

13:15.594 --> 13:17.530
What do you really
know about him?

13:17.530 --> 13:21.300
I know he wants me
to go with him!

13:21.300 --> 13:23.803
Are you sure
he said that, Bert?

13:23.803 --> 13:26.472
Because I never...
Forget it, Cedric!

13:26.472 --> 13:29.742
You're just jealous, 'cause
Sir Malcolm didn't ask you

13:29.742 --> 13:31.310
to be his right hand man.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.779
Huh! Now if you don't mind,

13:33.779 --> 13:37.483
I have some serious
packing to
do... alone!

13:40.319 --> 13:43.122
As you can see,
I've spared no expense

13:43.122 --> 13:44.490
on your equipment.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.760
I want this to be your most
successful expedition!

Oh no?

your... expedition.

16:12.237 --> 16:16.875
Sir Malcolm: Oh yes. It's
rather exciting, isn't it?

16:16.875 --> 16:20.112
Did you know, Bert is
planning to go along with you?

16:20.112 --> 16:21.146
Sir Malcolm: But he can't!!

16:21.146 --> 16:22.548
I know he can't,

16:22.548 --> 16:25.150
and I think you
should tell him why.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.453
Sir Malcolm: W-what?
You know then?

16:27.453 --> 16:29.822
Yes,
Sir Malcolm, I know.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.457
You can't swim,

16:31.457 --> 16:35.260
you didn't know when the rainy
season comes to Lingodo,

16:35.260 --> 16:36.996
and other things.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.164
Sir Malcolm:
I suppose I'm not a very

16:39.164 --> 16:42.167
convincing explorer, am I?

16:42.167 --> 16:44.503
It's just, sometimes

16:44.503 --> 16:47.473
you pretend to be
something so much,

16:48.140 --> 16:50.576
you end up believing
it yourself.

16:50.576 --> 16:54.446
It'll be hard for
you to tell Bert that..that...

16:54.446 --> 16:56.749
Sir Malcolm:
...that I'm not an explorer?

16:56.749 --> 17:01.453
Yes, I hope he won't
hate me for it, Cedric.

17:01.453 --> 17:03.789
Not Bert.
He'll understand.

17:08.794 --> 17:09.795
What!?

17:09.795 --> 17:12.331
That four-flushing fake!!

17:12.331 --> 17:14.266
We'll see about this!

Now, where is it?

A-haa! Here it is!

17:24.843 --> 17:27.146
I'll bet you never go
anywhere without yours.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.480
Right, Sir Malcolm?

17:28.480 --> 17:29.915
Sir Malcolm: The fact is, Bert,

17:29.915 --> 17:32.951
I've never been anywhere.

17:34.286 --> 17:35.654
Ah, what a kidder!

17:35.654 --> 17:38.057
Sir Malcolm: No, Bert,
I've never been to any of

17:38.057 --> 17:40.225

17:40.225 --> 17:42.161

I-I don't understand.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.034
Sir Malcolm:
It just happened, Bert.

17:49.034 --> 17:51.236
Because of the things I wrote,

17:51.236 --> 17:54.173
people expected me to be a hero.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.675
So... I became one.

17:57.376 --> 17:59.478
A paperback hero, Bert.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.915
I'm not an explorer.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.451
And there isn't going
to be an expedition.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.753
I'm sorry...

examples of quick thinking
