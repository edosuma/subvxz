WEBVTT

00:01.010 --> 00:02.733
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.905 --> 00:03.934
Back to normal.

00:04.014 --> 00:04.921
I just hope

00:05.004 --> 00:06.409
Kyle is still Kyle.

00:06.557 --> 00:07.821
I know you think I'm a bad guy.

00:07.901 --> 00:09.813
This whole thing
with Hillary is just physical.

00:09.893 --> 00:12.071
It has nothing to do
with how much I love Amanda.

00:12.398 --> 00:13.950
- You're still together.
- Yeah, why wouldn't we be?

00:14.036 --> 00:15.484
<i>I've been lying to Lori for months.</i>

00:15.564 --> 00:16.674
My grades are screwed.

00:16.754 --> 00:17.799
Look me in the eye,

00:17.879 --> 00:19.423
and tell me all of it was for nothing.

00:19.503 --> 00:20.529
It wasn't for nothing,

00:20.615 --> 00:21.781
and I can't say any more.

00:21.861 --> 00:24.307
Zzyzx experimented
with artificial reproduction

00:24.387 --> 00:26.260
and produced two primary assets:

00:26.346 --> 00:27.821
the male called...

00:27.907 --> 00:28.848
XY,

00:28.928 --> 00:30.696
the second is a female,

00:30.776 --> 00:31.742
<i>XX.</i>

00:31.822 --> 00:32.937
<i>She apparently escaped.</i>

00:33.098 --> 00:34.946
<i>She's fully developed.
Consider her dangerous.</i>

00:35.026 --> 00:36.225
- Can't be.
- Who is he?

00:36.305 --> 00:37.853
- The other asset.
- XY?

00:37.933 --> 00:39.414
I thought you said he was terminated.

00:39.494 --> 00:40.570
I'm going to tell Declan.

00:40.650 --> 00:42.704
- I can explain it to him.
- No, you can't.

00:42.784 --> 00:44.216
I need someone I can talk to.

00:44.296 --> 00:45.796
Then you know what, go ahead.

00:45.876 --> 00:48.015
Tell 'em everything.
And we'll see how long it takes

00:48.095 --> 00:50.271
before somebody catches wind
of who you are

00:50.351 --> 00:52.628
and drags you out of there.
Is that what you want?

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:05.751 --> 01:07.096
<i>Back to normal,</i>

01:07.448 --> 01:10.740
<i>a phrase of such simplicity
it nearly defines itself.</i>

01:11.723 --> 01:13.380
<i>The months
that had passed since I'd left</i>

01:13.460 --> 01:14.773
<i>had been anything but,</i>

01:15.350 --> 01:17.019
<i>and I was ready for that part of my life</i>

01:17.099 --> 01:18.609
<i>to be over.</i>

01:18.843 --> 01:20.388
<i>I was going to pursue normalcy as</i>

01:20.468 --> 01:22.359
<i>if my life depended on it.</i>

01:22.777 --> 01:24.421
...so you just give the team statistics

01:24.501 --> 01:26.084
a value of 2/3x,

01:26.183 --> 01:28.761
factor in floor conditions
and several other simple formulas...

01:28.841 --> 01:30.204
What's he talking about?

01:30.524 --> 01:33.250
The basketball pool at the office.
I have a secret weapon.

01:33.330 --> 01:34.998
Stephen, isn't that a little...

01:35.085 --> 01:36.215
unfair?

01:36.364 --> 01:38.379
Absolutely.
Brad took the whole thing last year.

01:38.465 --> 01:40.395
This year he's going down.

01:42.163 --> 01:44.039
Who's getting death by fork?

01:44.536 --> 01:45.436
Declan,

01:45.516 --> 01:47.610
if he's not dead already.
I wouldn't know.

01:48.003 --> 01:49.758
You two still having problems?

01:49.838 --> 01:51.905
If by problems you mean
him not returning my calls

01:51.992 --> 01:53.733
all weekend, then yes.

01:53.832 --> 01:54.812
I'm over it.

01:54.892 --> 01:57.443
Josh, I need your friend Robby's number.

01:57.523 --> 01:59.267
His mom asked me to volunteer

01:59.347 --> 02:00.950
for the Active Parents Committee.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.805
- Oh, really?
- To which you probably said,

02:02.891 --> 02:03.974
"No way in hell."

02:04.054 --> 02:05.696
What's wrong with a little volunteering?

02:05.776 --> 02:06.778
I have the time.

02:06.858 --> 02:10.061
Time to contribute
to the social annihilation of your son.

02:10.140 --> 02:11.441
Then it was time well spent.

02:13.642 --> 02:15.842
- May I say something?
- Depends.

02:16.064 --> 02:17.442
Latin, Greek or Arabic?

02:17.823 --> 02:18.892
Go ahead.

02:20.528 --> 02:21.659
Thank you.

02:23.011 --> 02:24.597
For this. For everything.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.077
You're welcome.

02:33.072 --> 02:34.412
So cool.

02:37.985 --> 02:39.547
<i>She cleaned up well.</i>

02:40.543 --> 02:43.433
<i>It took some work to get her
to understand the concept of soap.</i>

02:45.081 --> 02:47.331
Does she just sit there all day?

02:47.970 --> 02:50.884
Sometimes she sits facing the other way.

02:54.524 --> 02:55.774
Can she hear us?

02:56.512 --> 02:58.135
The room is completely soundproof.

03:00.312 --> 03:02.480
<i>We recovered some of
the hard drives from the explosion</i>

03:02.566 --> 03:04.718
<i>at the former Zzyzx complex.</i>

03:05.112 --> 03:06.182
I was right.

03:06.796 --> 03:08.444
The other subject, XY,

03:08.568 --> 03:10.840
the boy she drew in the pictures...

03:11.125 --> 03:13.646
wasn't terminated
like we were led to believe.

03:14.355 --> 03:15.573
Why would they lie?

03:16.102 --> 03:17.563
He's something of theirs in his head,

03:17.643 --> 03:19.976
something they wouldn't want
to admit was missing.

03:20.074 --> 03:21.438
What is it?

03:21.832 --> 03:23.074
Your job is to get it back.

03:26.777 --> 03:28.782
Where is he now?
I'll set up a retrieval unit.

03:29.926 --> 03:31.463
I wish it was that simple.

03:31.561 --> 03:33.492
The last time someone tried
to grab that boy,

03:33.578 --> 03:36.098
an entire complex was firebombed.

03:36.479 --> 03:38.446
I'd still like my parking space
in the morning.

03:40.500 --> 03:41.483
Fair enough.

03:42.307 --> 03:44.815
Everything you need to know
is in that file.

03:46.573 --> 03:48.147
<i>What should I do about the girl?</i>

03:50.067 --> 03:52.945
Actually, she makes me nervous
just sitting there.

03:54.482 --> 03:56.731
Get her a teddy bear or something.

04:38.395 --> 04:39.514
What's this?

04:39.964 --> 04:41.704
St. Collette,
the patron saint of people...

04:41.790 --> 04:44.767
- who have lost a parent.
- people who have lost a parent.

04:45.062 --> 04:46.070
You heard.

04:46.906 --> 04:47.939
I'm so sorry.

04:51.135 --> 04:52.636
I can't take this.

04:52.935 --> 04:54.813
It was my gift for you.

04:54.893 --> 04:56.617
Now it's a gift from me.

05:14.694 --> 05:16.643
Everything's gonna be okay.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.832
I promise.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.044
Young love makes me want to hurl.

05:37.155 --> 05:39.984
I wonder if Dull and Duller
will make Best Couple again this year?

05:40.451 --> 05:41.472
For what?

05:41.967 --> 05:43.295
The "Hit List".

05:43.381 --> 05:45.766
Everyone votes anonymously
in different categories.

05:45.861 --> 05:49.337
You know, things like Biggest
Fashion Don't or Hottest Teacher.

05:49.423 --> 05:51.060
Most in Need of an Enema.

05:51.392 --> 05:52.704
- It sounds mean.
- It is.

05:52.784 --> 05:54.683
But that doesn't stop
everybody from voting.

05:54.763 --> 05:56.641
Well, why would anyone care?

05:57.022 --> 05:58.301
Lesson number one:

05:58.387 --> 06:00.047
The list is life.

06:01.134 --> 06:02.536
I don't think I like that.

06:02.953 --> 06:04.647
You're telling me. You didn't suffer

06:04.727 --> 06:06.680
through last year's humiliation.

06:07.209 --> 06:09.434
- Hillary made the list.
- Yeah.

06:09.572 --> 06:11.059
Biggest SI...

06:12.190 --> 06:13.666
Four-letter word rhymes with...

06:13.752 --> 06:14.872
"chut."

06:16.100 --> 06:17.585
I suppose it could be worse.

06:17.665 --> 06:20.207
I could have an entire category
named after me.

06:21.547 --> 06:22.558
That hairnet...

06:22.638 --> 06:24.904
has the Biggest Geekman award
written all over it.

06:25.014 --> 06:26.845
Okay, Deichman's got a lock on that.

06:26.925 --> 06:28.863
That's why it's named after him.

06:28.943 --> 06:29.985
I don't know, dude.

06:30.065 --> 06:32.448
You're sort of giving him
a run for his money.

06:33.135 --> 06:34.709
Bana-guava.

06:34.821 --> 06:36.013
Hold the wheatgrass.

06:39.839 --> 06:41.830
I just got hammered on G-Force.

06:41.916 --> 06:43.220
This guy keeps popping in my game

06:43.306 --> 06:44.769
and wiping me out.

06:44.867 --> 06:47.237
You're not supposed to spend
your breaks on the Internet.

06:47.317 --> 06:49.330
It's, like, against the rules.

06:50.056 --> 06:52.672
Be less cool.
It'll really help your cause.

06:54.270 --> 06:55.401
Nice guy.

06:58.857 --> 07:01.402
Why are you eye-stalking those two?

07:02.867 --> 07:04.490
I'm gonna tell Amanda the truth.

07:06.624 --> 07:08.899
That's a bad idea with a capital very.

07:09.242 --> 07:10.453
Lesson number two:

07:10.576 --> 07:12.642
The messenger always gets shot.

07:13.380 --> 07:14.783
Not literally, but...

07:14.869 --> 07:16.467
you shouldn't be the one to tell her.

07:16.578 --> 07:19.271
She'll hate you for keeping it
a secret in the first place.

07:19.369 --> 07:21.176
It's a no-win situation.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.697
You could tell her.

07:23.796 --> 07:26.280
You don't even like her.
And you're the one he cheated with.

07:26.366 --> 07:27.462
What's done is done.

07:27.548 --> 07:32.035
There's no need in making a bigger
mess out of things than I already have.

07:37.916 --> 07:38.912
I have to go.

07:39.502 --> 07:40.695
So soon?

07:47.695 --> 07:48.925
Lori's here.

07:53.217 --> 07:55.049
I can't talk to her right now.

08:08.366 --> 08:10.087
- What's this?
- I found these...

08:10.173 --> 08:11.489
in Baylin's files.

08:11.735 --> 08:13.974
I can't just come meet you
whenever you call.

08:14.109 --> 08:17.182
- People will start asking questions.
- All these feats... all of them...

08:17.281 --> 08:19.211
were performed by ordinary people.

08:20.182 --> 08:21.731
Kyle, imagine what you could do.

08:24.363 --> 08:25.692
Are these real?

08:26.110 --> 08:27.388
Yeah, they are.

08:28.212 --> 08:32.547
We need to meet more often and
start exploring your physical limits.

08:33.106 --> 08:34.520
I start school again tomorrow.

08:34.606 --> 08:36.376
Well, then after school.

08:36.770 --> 08:38.962
After school, there are clubs,
activities, hanging out.

08:39.048 --> 08:40.975
- I was hoping...
- Shouldn't waste your time...

08:41.054 --> 08:42.124
hanging out.

08:43.304 --> 08:45.751
Kyle, this is what Adam wanted for you.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.527
And we need to see that through.

08:51.814 --> 08:52.859
All right?

08:56.671 --> 08:57.888
Now, the basic...

08:57.974 --> 08:59.548
principle, obviously,

08:59.991 --> 09:01.615
is mind over matter.

09:07.551 --> 09:08.350
Hey there.

09:09.432 --> 09:10.538
War and Peace.

09:11.620 --> 09:13.428
A little light reading.

09:22.602 --> 09:25.050
When do you think
you'll start working again?

09:25.714 --> 09:26.992
I haven't decided yet.

09:31.074 --> 09:34.295
We haven't had
a moment alone in a long time.

09:35.377 --> 09:36.719
How you feeling?

09:38.378 --> 09:39.387
I think...

09:42.448 --> 09:44.809
I thought it'd be easier
to get back to normal.

09:45.645 --> 09:47.661
What you've been through
is anything but normal.

09:48.916 --> 09:50.895
It's gonna take some time to adjust.

09:51.596 --> 09:52.752
You don't have to rush it.

09:55.101 --> 09:56.380
But what if I want to?

09:58.777 --> 10:00.007
Sometimes we...

10:00.499 --> 10:02.393
run away from things as a way of...

10:02.479 --> 10:05.503
protecting ourselves
from having to deal with them.

10:08.490 --> 10:10.052
Do you wanna talk about it?

10:11.192 --> 10:13.098
How much time do we have?

10:13.891 --> 10:14.954
You tell me.

10:23.357 --> 10:26.219
I think I'll keep running
a little longer while I figure it out.

10:27.993 --> 10:30.741
As long as you know I'm here
when you're ready.

10:32.806 --> 10:35.554
You still have 29,642 words left.

10:38.624 --> 10:40.178
You're not going anywhere.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.457
<i>I read the family history.</i>

10:49.109 --> 10:52.009
These people seem
to consider him one of their own.

10:52.105 --> 10:54.128
It's gonna be hard
to make him disappear.

10:54.317 --> 10:56.460
Actually, we'd like to get what we need

10:56.540 --> 10:58.997
without anyone noticing we were there.

11:01.437 --> 11:04.025
I'm not sure that I understand
how that's possible.

11:06.939 --> 11:09.077
You know what a firewall is, I assume.

11:10.247 --> 11:11.474
Of course.

11:12.190 --> 11:14.154
XY's brain is powerful...

11:14.277 --> 11:15.494
like a computer.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.310
He's managed to develop a...

11:18.390 --> 11:20.199
mental equivalent of a firewall.

11:20.915 --> 11:24.017
It's what prevented Zzyzx
from being able to control him

11:24.152 --> 11:26.309
and what will prevent us from...

11:26.498 --> 11:28.668
getting what's inside his head.

11:29.464 --> 11:31.681
That's where she comes in.

11:31.998 --> 11:33.683
What, like a mental hacker?

11:33.832 --> 11:35.788
In a manner of speaking, yes.

11:36.934 --> 11:38.159
I was joking.

11:38.466 --> 11:40.212
We need what he knows.

11:40.310 --> 11:42.758
She's the only one
capable of getting it.

11:44.611 --> 11:45.656
How?

11:45.885 --> 11:47.916
I mean, he's been living a normal life

11:47.996 --> 11:50.145
in the suburbs. Look at her.

11:51.012 --> 11:53.481
She hardly seems capable
of assimilating.

11:55.704 --> 11:57.226
Just leave that to me.

12:13.097 --> 12:14.963
Lori doesn't live here anymore.

12:16.635 --> 12:18.132
Where'd she go?

12:18.334 --> 12:19.539
To hell.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.553
It has excellent lighting.

12:27.544 --> 12:29.364
You're upset about Declan.

12:30.888 --> 12:32.398
I don't understand.

12:33.223 --> 12:35.691
I knew we were having issues,
but nothing that deserves him

12:35.771 --> 12:37.220
ignoring me.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.054
I don't know what I did.

12:43.535 --> 12:45.342
You didn't do anything.

12:45.842 --> 12:46.845
Then what?

12:46.931 --> 12:49.563
You've been talking to him,
you must know something.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.074
I think he's just going through
something right now and he's

12:56.154 --> 12:57.810
trying to work it out
in his head without

12:57.890 --> 12:59.792
bringing the people
he cares about into it.

12:59.887 --> 13:01.047
I'm his girlfriend.

13:01.209 --> 13:04.162
He should be able to talk
to me instead of avoiding me.

13:04.270 --> 13:05.934
Trust that I could help.

13:06.014 --> 13:07.508
He sucks.

13:11.063 --> 13:13.921
- We're gonna be late for school.
- School sucks.

13:14.568 --> 13:16.087
I can't get up.

13:16.167 --> 13:17.738
My whole body hurts.

13:20.295 --> 13:21.823
Mind over matter.

13:23.751 --> 13:26.051
Use your mind to convince
your body it feels better.

13:26.613 --> 13:28.497
If you believe you don't hurt,

13:28.780 --> 13:29.865
you won't.

13:31.488 --> 13:32.619
Will that work?

13:33.296 --> 13:34.587
For the next five minutes.

13:39.382 --> 13:40.407
Come on.

13:41.014 --> 13:42.228
Come on.

13:49.105 --> 13:50.885
- Kyle!
- Hey, man,

13:51.441 --> 13:52.736
good to have you back.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.357
Where's Amanda?

13:55.800 --> 13:58.330
Well, you don't have to worry
about Amanda. She's fine.

13:58.410 --> 14:00.031
I don't see it that way.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.752
Yeah? Well, how do you see it?

14:04.534 --> 14:06.665
You weren't honest with her
when you had the chance.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.116
Telling her the truth
would have hurt her.

14:09.201 --> 14:10.711
It was a no-win situation.

14:10.846 --> 14:12.130
But right now...

14:12.376 --> 14:14.687
it seems like she's the only one losing.

14:34.337 --> 14:37.007
Now that's a well-balanced meal.

14:37.654 --> 14:39.560
What the... This is a guys' bathroom.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.160
Relax. I have brothers.

14:43.634 --> 14:45.934
It's the only place
I can get a good wireless signal.

14:46.035 --> 14:47.422
Uh, how about a classroom?

14:47.520 --> 14:50.631
Yeah, they're not so into using
class time to play G-Force.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.181
I play G-Force.

14:53.770 --> 14:56.279
Have you come across
the handle AndyJ yet?

14:56.476 --> 14:58.612
- He's ruining me.
- I know.

14:58.882 --> 15:01.120
I heard you talk about it at the Rack.

15:02.307 --> 15:04.627
Bana-guava, hold the wheatgrass?

15:05.989 --> 15:08.175
I order it, like, everyday.

15:08.310 --> 15:09.334
Sorry.

15:10.494 --> 15:11.832
No big.

15:17.220 --> 15:20.915
Speaking of doing weird things
in weird places,

15:21.439 --> 15:23.796
I'm pretty sure
there's a cafeteria about

15:23.876 --> 15:25.263
a hundred yards from here.

15:25.349 --> 15:27.292
- I'm hiding out.
- From?

15:27.454 --> 15:30.031
The cafeteria is full of landmines
during "List Season."

15:30.302 --> 15:33.495
I don't wanna be branded
some loser like L.K. Deichman.

15:33.590 --> 15:36.386
You'd rather be a loser
who eats lunch in the bathroom.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.464
At least I'm in the right bathroom,

15:38.929 --> 15:42.570
- Miss whatever-your-name-is.
- It's Andy, actually.

15:42.745 --> 15:43.987
Andy Jensen.

15:48.355 --> 15:51.099
Or AndyJ to you.

15:57.282 --> 16:01.069
<i>Today is your last chance to buy
your tickets to the fifth annual...</i>

16:01.180 --> 16:04.327
<i>Tickets are only ten dollars
at the front office.</i>

16:05.235 --> 16:08.203
- Unbelievable.
- I have the answer.

16:08.634 --> 16:12.058
To life? Or to how I'll get my boyfriend
to quit his dump-and-dodge routine?

16:12.166 --> 16:14.377
- What are you wearing?
- You like?

16:14.512 --> 16:15.942
You look Amish.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.423
It's part of my strategy
to avoid the slut vote.

16:18.557 --> 16:20.018
I'm also gonna revirginize.

16:20.271 --> 16:21.272
Re-what?

16:21.424 --> 16:23.345
Revirginization. Think about it.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.073
If it's ours to give away,
then it's ours to take back.

16:26.530 --> 16:28.548
But we worked so hard to get rid of it.

16:28.658 --> 16:30.896
My problems began the minute
sex entered the picture.

16:31.005 --> 16:33.351
Next thing you know,
I'm the "chut" of the century.

16:33.540 --> 16:37.450
And if I had never had sex with Declan,
I wouldn't be in this situation.

16:38.340 --> 16:40.137
How does one revirginize?

16:40.969 --> 16:43.856
We just agree to it. I mean,
there's this whole ceremonial thingy,

16:43.964 --> 16:47.013
but mostly it's just us
deciding that it's true.

16:47.119 --> 16:50.246
Mind over matter. If we convince
ourselves it's true, then it is.

16:51.045 --> 16:53.578
We'll live our lives not
motivated by boys or sex

16:53.664 --> 16:55.506
or anything to do with boys and sex.

16:55.586 --> 16:58.432
In which case,
what do we do with ourselves?

17:03.165 --> 17:05.011
I guess we'll have to ask a virgin.

17:05.915 --> 17:08.083
There you are.
I feel like I haven't seen you all day.

17:09.111 --> 17:12.232
Look, I'm late for class,
but we need to hang out.

17:12.318 --> 17:15.151
I have the bonfire committee at three.
You want to help?

17:15.582 --> 17:17.867
I can't after school. I'm sorry.

17:17.967 --> 17:19.837
Bummer. Well, maybe this weekend.

17:20.396 --> 17:21.582
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.083
Will I see you at the bonfire?

17:35.212 --> 17:36.469
<i>Well, Amanda's in charge of it.</i>

17:36.552 --> 17:38.491
<i>Hmm, she'll be busy.</i>

17:41.291 --> 17:42.699
<i>Yes, she will.</i>

17:42.895 --> 17:44.014
<i>And what will you be?</i>

17:45.555 --> 17:46.903
<i>That depends on you.</i>

17:47.186 --> 17:48.871
<i>Well, then I guess anything's possible.</i>

17:57.721 --> 17:58.745
What's this?

17:59.015 --> 18:00.929
I recommend that you learn it.
All of it.

18:01.064 --> 18:03.572
- Who's Jessi Hollander?
- See for yourself.

18:07.065 --> 18:09.957
Don't bring me to work if you're just
gonna make me sit here all day.

18:10.492 --> 18:11.543
Hello.

18:11.813 --> 18:13.916
- I'm Emily's boss.
- Hi, Jessi.

18:14.091 --> 18:16.680
- Her sister.
- Nice to meet you.

18:19.190 --> 18:21.132
What did you do to her?

18:21.300 --> 18:25.017
Think of it like downloading
a program into a hard drive.

18:25.472 --> 18:29.025
Only she's the computer,
and her life is the program.

18:29.214 --> 18:31.885
Yesterday she was a non-communicative,

18:32.020 --> 18:36.038
cold-blooded killer with no means which
to live her life outside of that room.

18:36.254 --> 18:37.278
Today...

18:38.290 --> 18:43.024
she's a young teenaged girl who likes
strawberry ice cream and Avril Lavigne.

18:43.159 --> 18:44.723
And what about her memories?

18:44.912 --> 18:47.258
Zzyzx, the guy
that she killed in the woods...

18:47.420 --> 18:48.444
Deleted.

18:48.957 --> 18:52.303
Everything she experienced in the first
few days of her life has been erased.

18:52.637 --> 18:53.852
How?

18:54.418 --> 18:55.672
Ms. Hollander,

18:55.795 --> 18:58.287
we're a multi-billion dollar
technological research

18:58.409 --> 18:59.889
and development corporation.

19:00.283 --> 19:02.010
We have resources.

19:05.010 --> 19:07.222
She thinks that she's my sister.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.142
I'm just supposed to live that lie?

19:09.474 --> 19:11.576
That's the assignment.

19:17.881 --> 19:19.114
What's the next step?

19:21.474 --> 19:23.565
Get her into that family's life.

19:24.340 --> 19:27.191
Destabilizing the boy's
support structure will

19:27.290 --> 19:29.788
make him more vulnerable...
receptive to her.

19:31.514 --> 19:32.932
And she'll just know what to do?

19:33.018 --> 19:35.047
She won't know she knows anything.

19:35.859 --> 19:38.182
She'll just think that
she's the new girl...

19:38.330 --> 19:39.784
hoping to make friends.

19:41.943 --> 19:44.720
I recommend that you take her
for a test drive.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.695
Don't try to make contact.

19:48.297 --> 19:49.726
Just ease her in.

19:50.266 --> 19:52.315
Watch for cracks in the facade.

19:58.248 --> 20:01.116
<i>I don't think Adam meant
for us to take these studies literally.</i>

20:01.196 --> 20:02.536
It's basic science.

20:03.084 --> 20:04.314
Your body

20:05.002 --> 20:06.366
won't feel the burn

20:06.446 --> 20:08.274
until it reaches
the temperature of the fire.

20:08.360 --> 20:11.532
So I need to keep
my internal temperature constant.

20:11.630 --> 20:14.360
I understand what I'm supposed to do.
I just don't understand why.

20:14.893 --> 20:15.957
This isn't...

20:16.043 --> 20:17.606
about walking on coals.

20:18.331 --> 20:21.693
This is about you using your mind to
change the physiology of your body.

20:24.780 --> 20:26.058
You can do it.

20:31.630 --> 20:32.724
Come on.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.445
Focus.

20:43.397 --> 20:45.299
Hey! You're on the planning committee?

20:45.710 --> 20:47.846
- Uh, that's sweet.
- Actually, no.

20:47.926 --> 20:49.963
We're here to talk to you.

20:50.170 --> 20:51.593
Oh, yeah? About what?

20:51.743 --> 20:54.273
Well, we were wondering...

20:55.042 --> 20:56.203
How do I put this?

20:56.294 --> 20:57.777
Let's cut to the chase.

20:58.189 --> 20:59.744
We're revirginizing.

20:59.949 --> 21:02.048
We need to know what
your people do for fun.

21:02.134 --> 21:03.381
My people?

21:03.472 --> 21:04.894
Yeah, you know, the pure types.

21:07.476 --> 21:08.730
You're serious?

21:09.674 --> 21:10.869
Revirginizing?

21:11.791 --> 21:14.484
We're a little adrift,
socially speaking.

21:16.103 --> 21:17.581
Okay, well, uh,

21:17.805 --> 21:19.509
it's not that complicated.

21:19.697 --> 21:21.341
For example, the bonfire committee.

21:22.964 --> 21:25.792
Yeah, we're not so much committee folk.

21:26.529 --> 21:28.583
We'll, I guess I can't help you then.

21:30.995 --> 21:33.169
Maybe now's a good time to start?

21:33.374 --> 21:35.528
Yeah, we can be bonfirey.

21:35.715 --> 21:37.017
Okay, well, uh,

21:37.116 --> 21:38.948
tiki oiling or barbecue scrubbing?

21:44.029 --> 21:45.615
You go ahead. I'll hold your purse.

21:45.813 --> 21:47.275
Go ahead. Go.

21:52.401 --> 21:54.565
You made 400 cupcakes for the bonfire?

21:54.761 --> 21:56.175
Yeah, well...

21:56.544 --> 21:57.917
keeps me busy.

21:59.494 --> 22:00.989
I appreciate this new

22:01.307 --> 22:04.737
Martha Stewart universe you've
been inhabiting, but what's going on?

22:06.386 --> 22:07.914
Do you think it would be...

22:07.997 --> 22:10.262
awful if I didn't go back to work?

22:11.483 --> 22:13.055
I didn't know that was an option.

22:13.598 --> 22:15.210
I've been waiting to feel ready,

22:15.296 --> 22:17.350
but lately I'm starting
to wonder if I ever will.

22:18.248 --> 22:19.698
But you love your job.

22:20.051 --> 22:21.145
I did.

22:21.937 --> 22:23.929
Then I let myself get
too close to a patient

22:24.027 --> 22:26.006
and I nearly fell apart when I lost him.

22:26.117 --> 22:27.925
Kyle is not an ordinary patient.

22:28.012 --> 22:30.262
We all fell apart when he left.

22:30.618 --> 22:32.754
If you don't want
to go back to work, that's okay.

22:32.927 --> 22:35.684
Things at the company are going well.
We're gonna be just fine.

22:36.057 --> 22:38.381
But I hate that you're
doubting yourself.

22:38.493 --> 22:40.511
I just don't feel good at it anymore.

22:41.965 --> 22:43.254
Why would you say that?

22:43.463 --> 22:44.737
With Kyle...

22:45.139 --> 22:47.328
I still have a feeling that
something's not right,

22:47.451 --> 22:49.246
but he won't open up to me.

22:49.332 --> 22:50.771
I can't break through.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.692
The sex shack.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.868
Many a sandy night spent in here.

23:02.410 --> 23:03.406
Focus.

23:03.490 --> 23:05.639
Why do you guys wanna revirginize?

23:06.202 --> 23:08.307
We're trying to make
better life choices.

23:08.393 --> 23:10.164
So you think having sex is a mistake?

23:11.868 --> 23:13.142
Why do you ask?

23:13.247 --> 23:14.252
No reason.

23:16.725 --> 23:17.744
It's just...

23:17.834 --> 23:18.838
What?

23:21.322 --> 23:24.113
Tonight's mine and Charlie's
two-year anniversary...

23:25.516 --> 23:27.226
I don't know.
I thought it might be time.

23:27.386 --> 23:28.480
No!

23:28.567 --> 23:29.857
I mean...

23:30.561 --> 23:32.119
I don't think it's a good idea.

23:32.734 --> 23:34.038
Why not? I mean...

23:34.136 --> 23:36.776
I know he's not perfect,
but we've been through so much together

23:36.856 --> 23:38.539
and he's been so patient.

23:39.043 --> 23:40.974
I feel like I'm finally ready.

23:52.168 --> 23:53.496
Major gossip.

23:53.594 --> 23:54.842
<i>I don't like gossip.</i>

23:54.922 --> 23:56.595
Well, you're not gonna like this,
either.

23:56.693 --> 23:59.517
But I think there's something that
you should know about Amanda.

24:02.406 --> 24:03.685
What are you doing?

24:03.832 --> 24:06.832
Where are you going?
We were just starting to make progress.

24:06.943 --> 24:08.689
Sorry. This is important.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.226
Wait. Wait!

24:11.743 --> 24:14.371
You're letting petty things
compromise your destiny.

24:14.486 --> 24:16.121
What do you mean, my destiny?

24:18.102 --> 24:19.391
Like Baylin said...

24:20.904 --> 24:22.533
You can change the world.

24:22.763 --> 24:24.727
What if I don't wanna change the world?

24:25.477 --> 24:27.206
What if I just wanna be normal?

24:27.722 --> 24:29.973
The last time we had this conversation,

24:30.737 --> 24:32.383
you made a skylight explode.

24:32.463 --> 24:35.054
You're not normal.
You're never gonna be.

24:35.159 --> 24:37.843
I'm not gonna let you ruin
what we're trying to do here.

24:37.948 --> 24:39.267
What you're trying to do.

24:39.836 --> 24:41.514
I don't wanna do it anymore.

24:49.042 --> 24:51.176
I'm taking back what's near and dear.

24:51.284 --> 24:53.238
Letting go of all I fear.

24:53.345 --> 24:55.156
Holding on with all my might.

24:55.444 --> 24:58.165
Saving myself for prom night. Drink.

24:59.664 --> 25:01.955
- Okay, now we're born-again virgins.
- Yes.

25:02.567 --> 25:04.078
B- A-V. BAVs.

25:05.043 --> 25:06.932
- It's got a ring to it.
- I like it.

25:09.531 --> 25:11.252
Are you appreciating the irony

25:11.338 --> 25:14.847
that we just held our revirginization
ceremony in the sex shack?

25:31.634 --> 25:32.653
Is she here?

25:34.955 --> 25:36.959
Look at Prince Charming over there.

25:37.306 --> 25:39.548
I'm so glad I never slept with him.

25:50.808 --> 25:52.426
So many new people.

25:53.290 --> 25:54.737
You know what to do.

25:55.401 --> 25:57.000
Mingle and blend in.

25:58.781 --> 26:00.473
You want me to go with you?

26:04.038 --> 26:06.583
No, I don't need
my big sister glued to my hip.

26:20.617 --> 26:21.731
Have you seen Amanda?

26:22.068 --> 26:23.949
- No.
- McDonough! Let's go.

26:24.048 --> 26:25.007
Come on.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.657
You're still hanging out with Charlie?

26:28.184 --> 26:30.371
I found myself a little
short on friends lately.

26:31.950 --> 26:34.813
I'm worried he's not the kind of person
he's pretending to be.

26:35.824 --> 26:36.831
You would know.

26:40.524 --> 26:41.951
Kyle, thank God.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.629
All my helpers bailed on me.

26:43.990 --> 26:46.184
Sour Patch Kids on me. Hi, Amanda.

26:46.282 --> 26:48.607
I was wondering if
I could tell you about the cash box.

26:48.693 --> 26:49.717
Sure.

26:54.708 --> 26:56.528
So when can you break free?

26:57.817 --> 26:58.942
You're in a hurry.

26:59.785 --> 27:00.757
Yeah.

27:03.068 --> 27:05.214
I'm a couple of other things, as well.

27:05.989 --> 27:07.492
Hmm, I can see that.

27:08.866 --> 27:09.868
Yeah.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.387
Just give me five minutes.

27:18.385 --> 27:19.509
You promise?

27:19.990 --> 27:21.164
Yeah.

27:21.813 --> 27:22.820
Okay.

27:33.379 --> 27:34.768
What's that look?

27:35.003 --> 27:36.286
Back in business, huh?

27:36.863 --> 27:38.993
Yeah. Yeah, my business, man.

27:40.114 --> 27:42.388
I don't think you're as
careful as you think.

27:43.910 --> 27:45.274
What's that supposed to mean?

27:45.399 --> 27:48.103
It means you better go find
your girlfriend before she isn't.

27:55.412 --> 27:56.736
You suck.

27:57.295 --> 27:58.630
- What?
- You heard me.

27:58.951 --> 28:00.949
There's absolutely nothing

28:01.133 --> 28:02.785
rational or intelligent or

28:02.865 --> 28:04.959
remotely kind about
the way you've been treating me.

28:05.049 --> 28:06.395
- Lori, I...
- Let me finish.

28:07.738 --> 28:09.064
I feel hurt

28:09.273 --> 28:11.007
and angry and,

28:11.228 --> 28:13.291
at the moment, a little drunk, so...

28:14.094 --> 28:16.264
I'm here to tell you that you suck.

28:17.043 --> 28:18.634
I know I've been crazy.

28:18.966 --> 28:20.872
If I could figure out how to explain it,

28:20.958 --> 28:21.950
I would.

28:22.030 --> 28:24.201
How can we be together
if you can't talk to me

28:24.281 --> 28:26.120
about what you're going through?

28:31.848 --> 28:32.920
Oh, my God.

28:35.317 --> 28:36.866
You wanna break up.

28:40.268 --> 28:42.665
This is a place where the silent
treatment is not gonna fly.

28:42.776 --> 28:45.604
If you wanna break up,
you're going to have to say it.

28:54.409 --> 28:55.801
I wanna break up.

29:02.301 --> 29:03.572
And I suppose

29:03.671 --> 29:05.691
a why would be asking too much.

29:07.780 --> 29:08.919
I just, um...

29:11.065 --> 29:12.036
I can't.

29:15.167 --> 29:16.506
Well, that's great.

29:16.617 --> 29:18.498
Really nice. Really mature.

29:18.953 --> 29:21.338
I mean, it doesn't matter anyway.
I've already erased you.

29:21.449 --> 29:22.913
You and me? Done.

29:23.024 --> 29:24.081
Never happened.

29:40.066 --> 29:41.959
It's going well, right?
People are having fun?

29:42.058 --> 29:43.140
Are you?

29:43.238 --> 29:45.119
I will now that work's done.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.798
There's something
I was hoping to talk to you about.

29:52.085 --> 29:53.037
What's up?

29:55.471 --> 29:57.474
If you knew a secret about somebody,

29:58.332 --> 30:00.852
would you tell them even
though it might hurt them?

30:01.983 --> 30:05.088
Is is it something someone told you
never to tell?

30:05.249 --> 30:07.853
No, but they probably
don't wanna hear it from me.

30:09.791 --> 30:12.307
- Kyle, what's this about?
- Amanda,

30:12.417 --> 30:14.151
they're calling
for more sodas over there.

30:14.741 --> 30:15.823
I just...

30:16.284 --> 30:17.685
Oh, it never ends.

30:17.858 --> 30:19.702
All work and no play.

30:22.593 --> 30:24.364
What the hell do you think you're doing?

30:24.474 --> 30:26.392
I'm being a good friend.
What are you doing?

30:37.436 --> 30:39.789
Don't pull that innocent
stargazer crap with me.

30:39.875 --> 30:41.567
<i>Amanda's the only one who falls for it.</i>

30:41.658 --> 30:43.641
<i>Now what the hell
do you think you're doing?</i>

31:03.172 --> 31:04.595
<i>Kyle, look at me.</i>

31:05.311 --> 31:06.945
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

31:07.763 --> 31:09.834
Oh, hey, sorry.

31:12.243 --> 31:14.428
You know, you ought to be nice.

31:18.894 --> 31:20.170
Out of the way.

31:20.250 --> 31:21.280
Jessi, stop!

31:21.366 --> 31:22.878
Let go.

31:24.592 --> 31:26.804
It's cool. Go for a walk.

31:27.747 --> 31:29.013
What happened?

31:29.505 --> 31:31.089
I don't know. I...

31:43.506 --> 31:44.933
What do you think you're doing?

31:45.031 --> 31:47.081
I'm gonna find Amanda.
I wont let you lie to her;

31:47.161 --> 31:48.363
it's not right.

31:49.146 --> 31:50.318
Oh, right, I forgot.

31:50.404 --> 31:52.851
You're the guy who refuses
to throw a punch.

31:57.448 --> 31:59.709
- Tanner, give it a rest.
- Hey, whose side are you on?

31:59.837 --> 32:02.934
- No one's.
- Well, then stay the hell out of it.

32:04.482 --> 32:05.505
Fire.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.048
- Somebody...
- Oh, my God!

32:12.214 --> 32:13.873
There's a girl in there!

32:14.287 --> 32:15.310
Get help!

32:16.333 --> 32:18.185
Somebody call 911! Help!

32:20.647 --> 32:21.947
It's too hot.

32:24.902 --> 32:26.495
<i>Mind over matter.</i>

32:27.034 --> 32:30.284
<i>Everything I had walked away from
was right here in front of me.</i>

32:30.614 --> 32:32.578
<i>Everything I didn't want to be</i>

32:32.868 --> 32:35.228
<i>was everything I knew exactly how to do.</i>

32:42.130 --> 32:44.066
<i>We need help over here!</i>

32:55.428 --> 32:57.501
Get down, Kyle! Get down!

33:06.291 --> 33:07.841
She's breathing!

33:13.769 --> 33:15.246
How are you not burned?

33:24.200 --> 33:25.223
Go!

33:25.527 --> 33:27.352
Get outta here! Run!

34:14.905 --> 34:15.928
How...

34:21.869 --> 34:24.400
Please don't ask me any more questions.

34:25.174 --> 34:26.197
Why?

34:30.714 --> 34:33.414
Because you'll want to know
why I can do what I can do and

34:33.819 --> 34:36.520
I won't be able
to explain it to you because...

34:36.686 --> 34:39.216
I can hardly explain it to myself.

34:39.382 --> 34:40.695
But I can...

34:40.833 --> 34:42.766
help you figure it out.

34:43.696 --> 34:45.382
You don't have to be in this alone.

34:52.321 --> 34:53.344
I'm not.

34:55.917 --> 34:58.156
I have you and this family.

35:00.755 --> 35:03.680
And I don't want anyone to have
a reason to take me away.

35:04.504 --> 35:05.968
I wouldn't let that happen.

35:06.607 --> 35:09.816
If anyone found out, you might not have
a choice in the matter.

35:12.593 --> 35:14.341
We just got you back.

35:17.486 --> 35:20.224
If it means never
letting you go again...

35:21.413 --> 35:23.901
no one else needs to know
that you're different.

35:27.698 --> 35:29.993
Nicole, I don't want to be different.

35:32.537 --> 35:34.334
I just want to be ordinary.

35:37.545 --> 35:38.568
Honey...

35:41.168 --> 35:42.744
we could ignore

35:42.965 --> 35:45.812
all the things about you
that you can't explain

35:46.552 --> 35:49.345
and you could try to act
like everybody else,

35:50.423 --> 35:51.985
but tonight there was a girl

35:52.121 --> 35:53.668
trapped inside a burning building

35:53.748 --> 35:55.844
and your only instinct

35:56.341 --> 35:58.148
was to save her.

35:59.452 --> 36:00.945
That's who you are.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.545
And there is nothing

36:03.631 --> 36:05.526
ordinary about it.

36:31.879 --> 36:32.926
Crap.

36:40.033 --> 36:41.167
So busted.

36:41.693 --> 36:43.269
Before you say anything,

36:44.098 --> 36:46.310
yes, I have been drinking.

36:46.476 --> 36:48.882
And, yes, I know it's not a good idea.

36:50.029 --> 36:52.698
And, no, I cannot promise
that I will never do it again.

36:53.984 --> 36:57.606
I do, however, recognize
that I'm using it as a crutch

36:57.772 --> 37:00.731
to hide from the mistakes of my past,

37:00.882 --> 37:03.647
and I can assure you that I intend
on living a much

37:03.868 --> 37:05.915
less destructive life for myself

37:06.357 --> 37:08.382
in the future as soon as I...

37:08.469 --> 37:10.505
figure out what
my life is supposed to be.

37:12.319 --> 37:14.614
I love you, and I didn't drive.

37:15.886 --> 37:18.015
Oh, and I'm a virgin.

37:18.609 --> 37:19.632
Again.

37:22.533 --> 37:25.353
She's not actually getting
away with that, is she?

37:26.515 --> 37:27.565
Good.

37:28.666 --> 37:29.810
Cupcake, anyone?

37:34.208 --> 37:35.287
Where's Kyle?

37:35.618 --> 37:37.830
He seemed a bit out of it today.

37:37.996 --> 37:40.457
He was feeling a little down.
I talked to him.

37:42.047 --> 37:44.182
Then he'll be fine. You're good at that.

37:49.438 --> 37:51.651
He's right, you are good at that.

37:51.844 --> 37:54.526
Then I guess it's time
to stop running from it.

37:57.557 --> 38:00.239
Oh, so how was the rest of your night?

38:02.368 --> 38:03.530
Uneventful.

38:22.982 --> 38:24.679
I don't think they did it.

38:25.998 --> 38:27.077
You don't?

38:27.188 --> 38:29.455
I have great sex radar. I can tell.

38:29.621 --> 38:31.778
Besides, Amanda's a textbook case.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.160
She'd want the night to be perfect,
and last night's...

38:34.246 --> 38:35.783
pyrotechnic near-tragedy

38:35.893 --> 38:37.777
was hardly the ideal setup.

38:38.399 --> 38:40.169
I hope you're right.

38:40.611 --> 38:43.175
And voting season's over in five,

38:43.306 --> 38:45.560
four, three, two...

38:48.463 --> 38:51.491
I think we're about to get
sage words of wisdom, Kyle style.

38:51.629 --> 38:52.721
You mean, like,

38:52.914 --> 38:55.900
why are we both so worried about
what other people think of us?

38:56.066 --> 39:00.020
Or we can't be liked
until we like ourselves.

39:00.144 --> 39:04.473
Ooh, I bet it's that we get to decide
who we really are, not anyone else.

39:04.666 --> 39:05.689
Huh.

39:06.491 --> 39:07.509
Interesting.

39:08.606 --> 39:09.657
You're good.

39:19.915 --> 39:22.030
- Save me.
- From what?

39:22.196 --> 39:24.394
The list just came out.
I don't want any part of it.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.690
Do we really need
any more ways to be mean?

39:26.897 --> 39:28.362
That's what I say.

39:29.219 --> 39:32.564
Hey, I didn't see you leave last night.
You missed all the craziness.

39:32.758 --> 39:34.500
How's the girl from the fire?

39:34.666 --> 39:36.347
She's going to be completely fine.

39:36.435 --> 39:37.885
I guess she got out just in time.

39:39.374 --> 39:40.701
That's a relief.

39:41.005 --> 39:42.470
It's a miracle is what it is.

39:42.581 --> 39:45.208
- Let me ring you up.
- Crap!

39:45.387 --> 39:46.604
Are you on it again?

39:46.742 --> 39:49.457
Worse. I'm not even on it at all.

39:49.604 --> 39:50.751
But you are.

39:51.912 --> 39:52.936
What?

39:57.449 --> 40:00.795
I guess that just goes to show
how wrong it can be, huh?

40:01.348 --> 40:04.667
Totally. Hey, who got
"Biggest Slut" anyway?

40:08.095 --> 40:09.119
What?

40:29.756 --> 40:31.277
What's going on?

40:32.549 --> 40:34.097
I think they saw this.

40:39.195 --> 40:40.246
What?

40:43.453 --> 40:45.306
That's a really stupid joke.

40:55.222 --> 40:58.650
Very funny, everybody.
Very funny. That's good.

41:05.039 --> 41:07.832
Amanda, it's... it's a joke.

41:09.408 --> 41:10.790
It's not a joke.

41:13.778 --> 41:15.493
I'm sorry, but it's not.

41:18.368 --> 41:19.391
I know.

41:21.797 --> 41:23.180
I slept with him.

41:27.203 --> 41:28.475
She's lying.

41:30.529 --> 41:31.780
She is?

41:39.004 --> 41:41.004
It doesn't look like it.

41:44.895 --> 41:46.436
- Amanda...
- Stop.

41:47.895 --> 41:49.058
Just stop.

41:56.583 --> 41:59.111
This is what you wanted to tell me.

42:00.950 --> 42:03.402
You didn't think I wanted
to hear it from you.

42:07.311 --> 42:08.770
You were wrong.

42:34.045 --> 42:36.442
<i>In life, everybody gets labeled.</i>

42:37.127 --> 42:38.668
<i>Charlie was a cheater,</i>

42:39.306 --> 42:41.852
<i>giving Amanda the label of the betrayed.</i>

42:43.414 --> 42:45.603
<i>With the breakup of the "Best Couple,"</i>

42:45.765 --> 42:48.550
<i>Declan and Lori are left
with a new label:</i>

42:48.753 --> 42:50.264
<i>the heartbroken.</i>

42:51.553 --> 42:54.282
<i>People try to tell us
who we're meant to be,</i>

42:54.417 --> 42:57.607
