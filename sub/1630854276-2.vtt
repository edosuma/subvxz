travelling with his acts

03:55.269 --> 03:56.267
Basil's gone.

We were supposed to
meet yesterday but he...

03:58.339 --> 03:59.338
He never showed.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.406

04:16.290 --> 04:17.756
Marcie:
<i> Goldenview?</i>

04:17.758 --> 04:18.890

04:19.025 --> 04:20.392
Isn't that the
frozen veggie brand?

04:20.527 --> 04:22.760
Trudy:
<i> It's a megafarm owned</i>
<i> by the clawford family.</i>

04:22.796 --> 04:24.362
Didn't one of their
sons run for mayor

04:24.498 --> 04:25.363

04:25.399 --> 04:26.365
Brian.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.500
When was the last time
that you spoke to basil?

04:28.635 --> 04:29.868
Two days ago.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.903
He was supposed to meet
me yesterday morning,

04:32.039 --> 04:33.972
But he never showed.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.476
<i> No calls, no texts,</i>
<i> just nothing.</i>

04:37.611 --> 04:39.511
Has he ever done anything
like this before,

04:39.580 --> 04:41.045
Just stop responding?

04:41.081 --> 04:42.781
No, never.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.249
Alarm bells were
going off for me

04:44.318 --> 04:46.051
So I tried calling
goldenview where he works,

04:46.053 --> 04:46.985
But ned wouldn't even-

04:47.054 --> 04:49.254
Who is ned?
-The foreman.

04:49.389 --> 04:50.589
He completely
brushed me off.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.590
Marcie:
<i> Alarm bells?</i>

04:51.725 --> 04:53.258
Why was that?

04:57.798 --> 04:59.197
Um...

05:00.167 --> 05:01.199
Hey, if you want
us to help you,

05:01.268 --> 05:02.867
You have to tell
us everything.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.742
Basil's 18-year-old
brother desmond

05:10.811 --> 05:11.943
Came to work
for goldenview

05:12.012 --> 05:14.412
For the first
time this year.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.414
Basil had done it
four years running

05:16.450 --> 05:18.783
And convinced him it was gonna
be a great way to make money.

05:18.852 --> 05:21.753
But about a
month ago,

05:23.724 --> 05:25.323
Desmond died
on the job.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.458
What happened?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.360
Ned had desmond
driving a tractor,

05:29.396 --> 05:31.963
Which he wasn't
properly trained to do,

05:32.099 --> 05:33.098
Through the fields

05:33.167 --> 05:36.168
And the tractor
overturned into a ditch.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.336
<i> Basil didn't even get</i>
<i> to say goodbye to him.</i>

05:38.339 --> 05:40.304

sounds like a,

05:40.341 --> 05:41.640
Sounds like a
terrible accident.

Trudy:
<i> It wasn't an accident.</i>

05:44.244 --> 05:47.445
<i> That child had no business</i>
<i>driving that piece of equipment.</i>

05:47.481 --> 05:49.748
The kid didn't even
have a driver's licence.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.350
<i> You know they waited an</i>
<i> hour to call an ambulance?</i>

05:53.520 --> 05:55.020
Ellery:
<i> You're saying they</i>
<i> let the kid die?</i>

05:55.889 --> 05:56.955
Marcie:
<i> And I'm guessing</i>

05:56.957 --> 05:59.891
<i> Basil was asking way</i>
<i> too many questions.</i>

06:00.026 --> 06:00.959
Trudy:
<i> Basil was furious.</i>

06:01.028 --> 06:02.027
His little
brother's death

06:02.029 --> 06:04.396
Was completely
preventable.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.330
He threatened to
report goldenview

06:06.367 --> 06:07.999
To the migrant
workers' alliance.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.204
Things are bad enough
for migrant workers.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.839
Work shouldn't be
a death sentence.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.210
Well, it sounds
like he may have

06:18.345 --> 06:19.477
A wrongful
death claim.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.079
Did he go to the police?

06:21.081 --> 06:23.047
A migrant worker
going to the police?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.550
Please.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.552
Let's find basil.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.387
<i> We'll start at</i>
<i> the last place</i>

06:29.423 --> 06:31.088

<i> was for sure.</i>

06:33.326 --> 06:34.892
Thank you.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.563
Well, here we
have my desk.

06:39.466 --> 06:41.399
Oh, receptionist.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.237

-Yes.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.840

is impressive.

06:48.975 --> 06:50.475

06:51.077 --> 06:52.711
Have a seat.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.512
So I spoke to ona.

06:54.648 --> 06:55.513
Okay.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.115
She said the hold
up with processing

06:57.184 --> 06:59.517
The contact requests
is normal.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.586
It's to give the birth
parents time to file a veto

07:01.588 --> 07:03.554
If they don't wish
to be contacted.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.992
I keep thinking this
wasn't the right call.

07:08.929 --> 07:09.428
<i> I mean, I had</i>
<i> great parents,</i>

07:09.563 --> 07:10.595
A great childhood.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.863
Seeking out
birth parents

07:11.998 --> 07:14.800
Can bring up a lot of
complicated emotions.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.667
It's just,

07:16.703 --> 07:20.105
It's made me feel so
isolated, you know?

07:20.240 --> 07:22.107
Have you spoken to
marcie about it?

07:22.109 --> 07:23.775
Yeah, marcie's...

07:23.910 --> 07:26.545
She's got her own stuff

07:26.547 --> 07:28.112
Since the shooting.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.682
Yeah.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.287
Iris, I'm-I'm sorry.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.354
I wasn't even thinking, I-

07:36.356 --> 07:37.955
That's okay.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.558
Things with cliff
and I were new,

07:41.662 --> 07:45.296
But I keep dwelling on
what could have been,

07:45.365 --> 07:47.164
Which kind of makes
things worse.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.567
Yeah, I get it.

07:50.671 --> 07:51.903
He was a good man.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.604
Yeah, he was.

07:55.509 --> 07:59.043
Look, if you ever need an ear,
I'm here.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.679

08:03.350 --> 08:04.716

09:28.068 --> 09:29.934
I represent basil allen,
one of your workers.

09:30.003 --> 09:30.935
Is he here?

09:31.004 --> 09:33.405
Ned flores,
grounds manager.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.672
Sorry you made it
all this way but

09:34.708 --> 09:36.608
Basil allen ran off.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.143
What do you mean ran off?

09:38.278 --> 09:40.211
It happens a lot with
migrant workers.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.479
We bring 'em here
on contract,

09:41.515 --> 09:44.249
<i> Then first chance they get,</i>
<i> poof, in the wind.</i>

09:44.384 --> 09:45.650
You're lying!
-Trudy!

09:45.786 --> 09:46.685
What happened to him?!

09:46.820 --> 09:47.885
I know you did
something to him!

09:47.921 --> 09:49.020
Trudy! Trudy!

09:49.155 --> 09:50.721
Have a good day, ladies.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.158
Come on, come on.

Doug:
<i> The space looks incredible.</i>

10:00.767 --> 10:02.467
Michelle:
<i> It exceeds my wildest dreams.</i>

10:02.602 --> 10:04.502
Doug:
<i> Don't you get any ideas</i>
<i> about the wedding now.</i>

10:04.504 --> 10:05.337
The second time around

10:05.472 --> 10:06.738
Is supposed to be
more intimate, dummy.

10:06.873 --> 10:08.106
[doug chuckles]

10:08.175 --> 10:09.741
Michelle:
<i> I'm still so grateful</i>
<i> to viv for her donation.</i>

10:09.876 --> 10:12.676
Well, she puts her money
where her mouth is.

10:12.678 --> 10:13.577
<i> About that,</i>

10:13.614 --> 10:15.079
I heard about eskasoni.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.114
<i> Viv wants to move</i>
<i> forward immediately.</i>

10:17.150 --> 10:19.050
That's great news!

10:19.185 --> 10:20.218
Yeah.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.786
I'm sensing a but here.

10:21.921 --> 10:23.487
I'd have to do it on my own.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.589
Leave marcie's firm.

10:25.626 --> 10:26.957
Yeah.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.327
This has been a dream of yours
for as long as I've known you.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.862
Doug:
<i> Well viv sees</i>
<i> something in me</i>

10:30.864 --> 10:32.197
If she's giving me an
opportunity like this.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.932
Marcie would want
you to do this.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.100
<i> Seriously.</i>

10:36.169 --> 10:40.004
<i> Douglas, these are</i>
<i> all good things.</i>

10:40.007 --> 10:40.938
For us,

10:41.008 --> 10:42.774
For the community,

10:42.909 --> 10:43.941
For you.

10:44.011 --> 10:51.816
[soft dramatic music]

10:53.020 --> 10:54.619
Marcie:
<i> Okay, if we're gonna</i>
<i> work together,</i>

10:54.621 --> 10:55.754
You have to listen to me.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.156
Ned's the one who does
their dirty work.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.758
<i> He was the one who</i>
<i> wouldn't call the doctor</i>

10:59.893 --> 11:01.559
The night basil's
little brother died.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.695
Trudy, I know how you feel,
I really do.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.130
He was lying!

11:05.265 --> 11:07.232
Okay, basil wouldn't
just run off.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.100
Basil told cruz he was
gonna make a complaint to-

11:09.235 --> 11:10.768
Wait, who's cruz?

11:10.804 --> 11:12.237
He's another migrant worker,

11:12.372 --> 11:14.239
<i> Someone basil</i>
<i> considered a friend.</i>

11:14.241 --> 11:16.841
But cruz betrayed him
and went straight to ned.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.243
Basil confronted
him about it

11:18.378 --> 11:20.378
And the two just got
into a huge fight

11:20.380 --> 11:21.779
And it just got really ugly.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.381
Okay, can we talk to him?

11:23.516 --> 11:24.549
I think he got sent to pei.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.917
Pei?

11:25.986 --> 11:28.085
Trudy:
<i> They've got farms across</i>
<i> all four provinces.</i>

11:28.121 --> 11:30.988
<i> Now cruz manages the private</i>
<i> home where the parents live.</i>

11:32.693 --> 11:34.258
Iris, you got a second?

11:35.095 --> 11:36.227
What's up?

11:36.296 --> 11:37.862
Marcie:
<i> I need some background</i>
<i> on a company,</i>

11:37.864 --> 11:39.263
Goldenview fields.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.398
The salad bag company?

11:40.533 --> 11:41.766
Marcie:
<i> I want to know</i>
<i> about that company.</i>

11:41.901 --> 11:43.067
I want to know
about the family.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.069
Any complaints,
scandals, you name it.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.404
On it.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.207
Marcie:
<i> Ellery, can you go to</i>
<i> pei to the family estate?</i>

11:49.276 --> 11:50.808
See if you can get
cruz to speak to you.

11:50.877 --> 11:51.876
Great.

11:52.011 --> 11:54.245
Let's hope I don't end
up in jail... Again.

Fingers crossed.

Marcie:
<i> It's too soon to tell, but...</i>

12:21.274 --> 12:23.674
I don't know, something
just doesn't feel right.

12:27.947 --> 12:29.680
On the eskasoni legal clinic.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.850
Separate from the firm.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.121
So you're leaving?

12:37.124 --> 12:38.456
I'm considering it.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.058
It's a huge opportunity.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.928
It is. Yeah.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.064
<i> Boy, she's smart.</i>

Dismantling the firm

This isn't about that.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.235
Isn't it?

12:52.773 --> 12:53.871
Of course.

Of course it was.

Marcie, I know you asked

I was his only
real relationship.

of the others.

him to get citizenship.

29:40.746 --> 29:42.746
Hi, hi, do-do
you remember me?

29:42.881 --> 29:44.214
I'm basil allen's friend.

29:44.349 --> 29:45.482
We've been looking for him.

29:45.484 --> 29:46.516
Have you seen him?

29:46.519 --> 29:47.951
Wait, we're trying
to locate him.

Ned:
<i> What are you</i>
<i> two doing here?</i>

29:55.194 --> 29:56.893
It's a public field,
mr. Flores.

29:56.929 --> 29:59.763
You're trying to ask our workers
questions behind my back.

29:59.898 --> 30:01.198
You don't own them.

30:01.267 --> 30:02.699
We can talk to them
if we want to.

30:02.834 --> 30:06.569
I already told you,
basil allen ran off.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.939
You and I both know
that's not the truth.

30:09.074 --> 30:11.108
What are you talking about?

30:11.243 --> 30:13.243
Basil didn't run off.

30:13.279 --> 30:14.845
He was loaded into
the back of a truck

30:14.847 --> 30:16.246
And taken to newfoundland.

30:16.315 --> 30:19.583
<i> Now, you lied mr. Flores,</i>
<i> and I want to know why.</i>

30:20.919 --> 30:23.587
I don't know where
you got that from

30:23.589 --> 30:25.388
But you need to
get outta here.

30:26.392 --> 30:27.858
Make me.

Marcie:
<i> But are you okay?</i>

30:50.415 --> 30:51.949
Old man still has
fight in him.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.218
Well, that definitely
wasn't up for debate.

30:55.688 --> 30:58.154
<i> Look, I get the instinct to</i>
<i> blame avery for what happened,</i>

30:58.190 --> 30:59.155
I did too.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.324
I don't blame him.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.428
But he could have
been better to her.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.129
That's hard to forget.

31:08.601 --> 31:11.567
[sighs] there's
something else that I, um,

31:13.038 --> 31:15.572
That I'm here to
talk to you about.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.040
Hmm, yeah.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.843
[marcie sighs]

31:23.048 --> 31:28.418
So I've been having
these, uh, dreams

31:30.188 --> 31:32.855
About the dominican trip
that I took with rolanda.

31:32.892 --> 31:33.790
[austin chuckles]

31:33.926 --> 31:35.325
I remember that trip.

31:35.327 --> 31:38.761
You two were so excited,
couldn't stop talking about it.

31:39.832 --> 31:44.301
You know, at first,
I, uh, I didn't know why

31:44.436 --> 31:46.169
<i> I was having these dreams,</i>

31:46.205 --> 31:48.005
<i> But then my</i>
<i> therapist told me</i>

31:48.007 --> 31:50.741
That it was because
of the shooting.

31:50.876 --> 31:56.313
It-it brought up all of
these buried memories

31:56.382 --> 31:58.115
<i> And I remembered...</i>

32:01.887 --> 32:03.453
That rolanda wasn't...

32:05.023 --> 32:06.589
She wasn't doing well.

32:09.828 --> 32:11.761
She tried to take her
life on that trip.

32:13.232 --> 32:17.033
And I knew and I
didn't tell you.

32:19.672 --> 32:23.440
[sombre music]

32:23.442 --> 32:27.243
There were other times,
other attempts.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.114
When ro was younger,

32:31.183 --> 32:32.782
I knew there was an issue.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.853
We tried to get
her help but the-

32:37.589 --> 32:39.056
Folks weren't having it.

32:40.392 --> 32:42.459
Didn't want people in
the community talking.

32:43.929 --> 32:47.697
I still feel guilt
wondering if I could have

32:50.402 --> 32:51.935
Done more.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.341
I should have told you.

32:59.511 --> 33:02.179
I just loved her so much, dad.

[sombre gentle music]

33:08.220 --> 33:10.620
Well, melanie won't
make the wedding.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.088
She's stuck in australia.

33:12.124 --> 33:14.057
Ah, that's too bad.

33:15.294 --> 33:16.759
It is!

33:16.795 --> 33:19.029
And I never thought I'd
say that about my sister

33:19.164 --> 33:20.296
After everything.

33:20.298 --> 33:21.264
Old drama's still drama

33:21.400 --> 33:24.835
And this wedding has to
go off without a hitch.

33:24.837 --> 33:26.436
Speaking of that,

33:40.552 --> 33:41.851
Although I'm starting
to regret it.

33:41.987 --> 33:43.252
Because of viv's leah stunt?

33:43.288 --> 33:45.422
She pitched
leadership to me,

33:45.557 --> 33:47.490
Taking the reigns, autonomy.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.061
But it felt like she
was working me.

33:52.131 --> 33:53.530
I didn't like it.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.199
So you're afraid that
marcie might be right?

33:56.235 --> 33:58.468
That vivian's just
chasing you to hurt her?

I don't want to choose between
my community and marcie.

couldn't come home,

Basil allen has been
missing for days

34:58.730 --> 35:00.330
And instead of
giving us answers,

35:00.465 --> 35:02.933
Your entire operation
has closed ranks.

I assure you that this is
nothing but a misunderstanding.

<i> Right.</i>

35:31.463 --> 35:33.629
There seems to have
been a clerical error

35:33.665 --> 35:34.830
And mr. Allen
was transferred

35:34.867 --> 35:37.166
To our newfoundland
farm by mistake.

35:37.168 --> 35:39.035
You know you're not supposed
to move migrant workers

35:39.037 --> 35:40.836
From their initial
location of employment.

35:40.973 --> 35:44.374
I'm well aware of the rules
of the program, ms. Diggs.

35:44.443 --> 35:45.976
As I said,
it was an error.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.777

<i> Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

41:21.346 --> 41:22.712
Anyway, I got a stack
of files on my desk

41:22.781 --> 41:24.580
The size of a
large toddler so.

41:26.318 --> 41:27.884
Marcie:
<i> Doug?</i>

41:30.322 --> 41:31.721
Thank you.

[soft dramatic music]

41:37.795 --> 41:42.665
â™ª

41:42.667 --> 41:43.799
Hey, it's me.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.067
<i> Ellery's on the line too.</i>

41:45.103 --> 41:46.135
What do you got?

41:46.137 --> 41:47.870
I think I found
basil's phone case.

41:47.939 --> 41:50.206
<i> Jamaican flag,</i>
<i> corinthians quote?</i>

41:50.341 --> 41:51.374
<i> No phone though.</i>

41:51.509 --> 41:53.042
Yeah, someone
probably stole it.

41:53.044 --> 41:55.244
Iris:
<i> I put a scare into the</i>
<i> guy at the charter house.</i>

41:55.313 --> 41:57.347
So if anyone has it,
I'm sure they'll turn it in.

41:57.482 --> 41:58.915
Not likely.
They would get rid of it.

41:58.917 --> 42:01.084
Iris:
<i> Great. So back to zero?</i>

42:01.086 --> 42:03.218
Marcie:
<i> No, just the fact that</i>
<i> the case was there</i>

42:03.255 --> 42:05.154
Proves that he
was on that boat.

42:05.156 --> 42:07.090
And then disappeared
some time after?

42:07.092 --> 42:09.859
There is more here
than meets the eye.

42:11.796 --> 42:13.563
Oh no, guys.

42:14.766 --> 42:16.298
Marcie:
<i> What's up?</i>

42:16.334 --> 42:18.234
I think I found him.

42:18.369 --> 42:23.305
[ominous music]

42:23.975 --> 42:25.574
What happened?

42:26.477 --> 42:27.977
Did you find him?

42:30.115 --> 42:31.647
The authorities found a body

42:32.884 --> 42:35.418
<i> That washed up on the</i>
<i> coastline of pei.</i>

42:36.721 --> 42:38.187
<i> They confirmed the identity.</i>

42:40.458 --> 42:41.857
It's basil.

42:41.893 --> 42:44.460
[sobs] no, it's not, no.

42:44.596 --> 42:46.395
No, I don't,
I don't believe it.

42:46.464 --> 42:49.465
Marcie:
<i> They suspect that he</i>
<i> fell off the boat,</i>

42:49.501 --> 42:52.735
That they were ferrying migrant
workers to newfoundland.

42:54.272 --> 42:56.072
No, no, it's not him.

42:56.141 --> 42:58.141
I'm so sorry, baby.

42:58.143 --> 43:02.779
[sobbing]

43:02.781 --> 43:04.747
I promise you

43:04.783 --> 43:08.084
We are going to find out
what happened to him.

43:08.219 --> 43:12.821
We are gonna find out exactly
what happened to him.
