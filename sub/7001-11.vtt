01:12.609 --> 01:16.079
Brad! Come on, let's go! Hurry up!

01:16.169 --> 01:19.760
Hey, quiet down. Your mom's up
there trying to write that speech.

01:19.849 --> 01:23.919
She's been working on that speech for
mo weeks. When is she gonna finish?

01:24.010 --> 01:27.159
Well, maybe never if she doesn't get
some peace and quiet.

01:27.250 --> 01:29.280
- Quiet.
- OK, OK.

01:29.369 --> 01:31.200
Brad!

01:31.290 --> 01:34.240
Shh, quiet.
What are you doing?

01:34.329 --> 01:36.889
We're going to the park
to play Blade Warriors.

01:36.970 --> 01:39.720
Blade Warriors?
I don't like the sound of that.

01:39.809 --> 01:41.720
I've got the net. Let's go.

01:41.809 --> 01:46.240
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
wait, wait, wait here.

01:46.329 --> 01:49.040
- What's the net for?
- Nothing.

01:50.569 --> 01:53.520
These are not "nothing" faces.

01:53.609 --> 01:57.520
This would be a "nothing" face.

01:57.609 --> 02:00.280
- Yeah.
- No, no. Come here, come here.

02:00.369 --> 02:02.119
You guys wouldn't be going to the park

02:02.210 --> 02:06.319
and snagging kids in this net, would you?

02:06.409 --> 02:08.079
- Good idea. Dad.
- Yeah.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.520
Bad idea.
The net stays here.

02:10.609 --> 02:15.520
Brad. I buy safety equipment.
I intend for you to use it, all right?

02:15.609 --> 02:16.919
Is that cologne you're wearing?

02:17.010 --> 02:19.839
This is the stuff
you bought at the car wash.

02:19.930 --> 02:22.520
That's air freshener.

02:22.609 --> 02:26.800
That came with some mud flaps.
You smell like a piña colada.

02:26.889 --> 02:29.270
He's wearing it for Jennifer Sudarsky.

02:29.369 --> 02:31.520
- That's it.
- Whoa!

02:31.609 --> 02:34.639
Take care of your brother.

02:34.730 --> 02:36.760
Jill. I thought you were working
on that library speech.

02:36.849 --> 02:39.040
Well. I came down
to get something to eat.

02:39.129 --> 02:41.639
and I noticed
the refrigerator light was out.

02:41.730 --> 02:43.040
o .

02:43.129 --> 02:47.119
So I happen to think it's very important
to have a nice, bright refrigerator light.

02:47.210 --> 02:52.000
- Jill, you're procrastinating again.
- I am not procrastinating.

02:52.089 --> 02:55.359
Ew. Look at this refrigerator.
It's filthy. I have to clean this now.

02:56.290 --> 02:58.520
Jill, why did you agree
to give this speech?

02:58.609 --> 03:01.399
- Because I want to give this speech.
- Why aren't you working on it?

03:01.490 --> 03:04.559
Because I had to replace
the refrigerator light.

03:04.649 --> 03:08.319
Jill, this is an honor.
Who was it that raised

03:08.409 --> 03:11.040
- more than $4,000 for the new…
- 7,000.

03:11.129 --> 03:14.000
…$7,000 for the new computer system
for the library?

03:14.089 --> 03:16.079
- I did.
- Who got all the volunteers

03:16.169 --> 03:18.879
to go door to door to collect money.
including a hundred bucks out of me?

03:18.970 --> 03:21.159
- I did.
- Who's the perfect person for the speech?

03:21.250 --> 03:24.000
Somebody else.

03:24.089 --> 03:26.280
Jill, it's just a two-minute speech.

03:26.369 --> 03:29.990
Yeah, but it's to 250 people.

03:30.089 --> 03:33.480
You're making a lot more out of this
than it really is.

03:33.569 --> 03:36.129
Well, that's easy for you to say.
You do this for a living.

03:36.210 --> 03:42.079
It doesn't bother you, you know? You
love attention and you have a big mouth.

03:42.770 --> 03:45.559
Look, you don't have to do
anything the rest of the day

03:45.649 --> 03:48.109
except breathe and write that speech.

03:48.210 --> 03:51.159
I'll keep the boys out of your hair.
I'll handle everything.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.599
Just try to go upstairs
and finish the speech.

03:54.649 --> 03:56.559
- Thank you, sweetie.
- Got it.

03:56.649 --> 03:58.440
But first I'm gonna clean the house.
cos it's really filth.

03:58.530 --> 04:01.919
No. You're not getting off the hook.
Go upstairs, write the speech.

04:02.010 --> 04:05.200
Stop procrastinating.
I will clean this house, top to bottom.

04:05.290 --> 04:09.839
Do you promise that you won't
rewire or blow up anything?

04:09.930 --> 04:14.280
- Why are you so mean to me?
- Do you really think I can do this thing?

04:14.369 --> 04:17.119
Yes, of course.
You can do anything you want. Jill.

04:17.209 --> 04:20.358
Nobody thought you could
land me as a husband and…

04:23.169 --> 04:25.599
Well, that's certainly inspirational.

04:32.010 --> 04:34.280
We've cut all our side panels.

04:34.369 --> 04:37.599
and I've just finished drilling
the holes for our dowel joints.

04:37.690 --> 04:41.280
If I were to put a hinge right here, Al, we'd
have a pretty swinging joint, wouldn't we?

04:45.490 --> 04:48.280
- Take it, Al.
- I don't think so, Tim.

04:48.369 --> 04:50.599
Anyway, next time.
Al and I will show you

04:50.690 --> 04:53.069
how to complete the entire bookcase.

04:53.169 --> 04:57.119
And that brings us to the Tool Time
tip of the day - housecleaning.

04:58.450 --> 05:02.839
Oh. I can hear the guys
out there going. "Uh?"

05:03.730 --> 05:05.639
"Get the wife in here, Tim.
so she can hear this."

05:05.730 --> 05:09.559
No, no, no, men.
Housekeeping, housecleaning.

05:09.649 --> 05:13.960
house-taking-care-of is like
shop maintenance. It's for men, too.

05:14.050 --> 05:19.599
Men, it's the '90s. We should share in
the housecleaning responsibilities, right?

05:19.690 --> 05:21.800
I didn't hear anything.

05:21.889 --> 05:26.480
You know. I'm judging
from the lack of enthusiasm

05:26.569 --> 05:29.480
that you men are disinterested.
and maybe it's because

05:29.569 --> 05:33.190
they do not design housecleaning
equipment with men in mind.

05:33.290 --> 05:37.069
- If they did, it would have what?
- More power!

05:37.169 --> 05:41.319
You're darn right, more power.
And maybe a little style, too.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.399
How can they expect us to clean a house

05:43.490 --> 05:46.050
with housecleaning equipment
that's not designed for us?

05:46.129 --> 05:50.480
Oh, the Daisy Soft Sweep Decor Series
in harvest gold.

05:50.569 --> 05:53.839
The vacuum cleaner from hell.
What is this all about?

05:53.930 --> 05:57.550
I want a man's vacuum cleaner.
How about an Indianapolis 500 version?

05:57.649 --> 06:01.159
All burnished chrome, matte black.
analogue gages, turbo boost in there.

06:03.210 --> 06:05.480
More power -
it'll suck the throat out of a parrot.

06:08.089 --> 06:12.399
Whew. Maybe I stepped over the line
just a little bit just then.

06:12.490 --> 06:15.599
but I think you get my point.
There's nothing wrong

06:15.690 --> 06:17.559
with a man doing housework.

06:17.649 --> 06:20.109
I mean, Al does a lot
of the cleaning around here.

06:20.210 --> 06:24.480
- I do all the cleaning, Tim.
- Yeah, right, Al.

06:24.569 --> 06:27.319
- I could use some help.
- We all could, Al.

06:30.889 --> 06:32.960
I'm Tim Taylor.
I want to give you a little tip here.

06:33.050 --> 06:35.200
Half the dirt in the world is men's.

06:35.290 --> 06:37.440
Let's clean it up.
See you next time.

06:42.290 --> 06:45.200
Come on. Dad.
We want to go back to the park.

06:45.290 --> 06:47.919
I told Bob and Stinky that we'd be back.

06:54.050 --> 06:58.399
Well. Bob and Stinky
are just gonna have to wait.

06:58.490 --> 07:01.240
cos we're gonna clean
this house up for your ma.

07:01.329 --> 07:03.359
We do that to support our woman.

07:03.450 --> 07:05.750
- I don't have a woman.
- Well.

07:05.849 --> 07:09.520
maybe Stinky could set you up with one.

07:09.609 --> 07:11.280
I have a woman - Mommy.

07:11.369 --> 07:13.930
Your mommy can't be your woman, doofus.

07:14.010 --> 07:19.129
A lot of men pay a psychiatrist a lot
of money to figure that one out. I tell you.

07:21.770 --> 07:25.200
We are gonna clean
the house the power way.

07:25.290 --> 07:27.040
Cleaning the house is a girl's job.

07:27.129 --> 07:29.760
Hey, hey, hey.
We are enlightened men.

07:29.849 --> 07:32.559
and enlightened men share
household responsibilities, right?

07:32.649 --> 07:37.119
- What's "enlightened"?
- It means "scared of Mom".

07:37.889 --> 07:41.240
Cleaning the house can be a lot of fun.
This is Dodge City at high noon.

07:41.329 --> 07:44.240
It's very dirty in here.
Quick, get to the windows, boys!

07:44.329 --> 07:46.520
Cover us! Come on! Hyah, hyah.

07:46.609 --> 07:48.680
All right, holster those weapons.

07:48.770 --> 07:51.520
On three, give me that quick draw.
One, two, three, clean.

07:51.609 --> 07:54.760
Hyah, hyah, hyah, hyah.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.599
What about me. Dad?
What do I get to do?

07:57.690 --> 08:01.720
You get the most important job.
You're Sheriff Wyatt Dirt.

08:02.849 --> 08:05.230
You've got to wipe out
the Dust Bunny Gang.

08:05.329 --> 08:07.629
- What?
- Here, hold that.

08:09.930 --> 08:12.119
All loaded.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.559
Saddle up, boy.

08:18.369 --> 08:22.119
Hyah, hyah!

08:22.210 --> 08:23.559
All right! Hi, hon.

08:23.649 --> 08:27.399
Well, you are obviously just playing
around. You're not cleaning the house.

08:30.329 --> 08:33.950
Wait a minute. I see some outlaw dust
villains on the coffee table. Go at it.

08:34.049 --> 08:37.669
Guys, make sure you get
the outside of the doors.

08:38.129 --> 08:40.200
I thought you were upstairs
writing that speech.

08:40.289 --> 08:43.318
- Well, may I please get a soda?
- Certainly.

08:43.409 --> 08:46.359
- Ooh, yeah.
- What is that smell?

08:46.450 --> 08:50.559
Their favorite lunch -
beanie-weenie casserole.

08:50.649 --> 08:53.680
Touch of Spam in there, beef jerky.
and potato chip dressing on top.

08:53.770 --> 08:56.839
- What do you think?
- I'll pass.

08:58.129 --> 09:01.319
- How you doing?
- Oh. I'm fine. Just taking a little break.

09:01.409 --> 09:03.639
- Can I see it?
- It's not very good.

09:03.730 --> 09:07.159
- Let me see it. Maybe I can help.
- I don't feel like it and you can't make me.

09:07.250 --> 09:10.480
Let me ask you this. Have you gotten
past the point where you say:

09:10.569 --> 09:12.760
"Good afternoon.
It's a pleasure to be here today"?

09:12.849 --> 09:15.200
Can I use that?

09:15.290 --> 09:17.480
You haven't written your first line yet?

09:17.569 --> 09:19.720
Yes, but yours is better.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.480
What the hell
have you been doing up there?

09:21.569 --> 09:24.000
I just feel self-conscious getting up
in front of a group of people.

09:24.089 --> 09:27.760
- You don't like the way you look?
- What's wrong with the way I look?

09:27.849 --> 09:29.200
Nothing. That was just a question.

09:29.290 --> 09:31.720
Why was that the first question you asked?

09:31.809 --> 09:33.480
All right, here's another first question.

09:33.569 --> 09:36.240
Are you so attractive and thin
you're afraid to go up in front of people?

09:36.329 --> 09:40.030
So, what, you're saying I'm fat and ugly?

09:44.290 --> 09:47.359
I'm not gonna win at this, am I?

09:47.450 --> 09:51.480
It's not looking good.
OK. Look. Give me that first line again.

09:51.569 --> 09:54.839
- "Good afternoon…"
- "It's a pleasure to be here today."

09:54.930 --> 09:58.680
"It's a pleasure to be here today."

09:58.770 --> 10:01.200
Wait, wait, wait.
think I've got the last line for you.

10:01.290 --> 10:04.520
"Thank you very much.
It's been a pleasure being here today."

10:09.169 --> 10:12.319
"Good afternoon.
It's a pleasure to be here today."

10:12.409 --> 10:15.000
No, it's not.

10:15.089 --> 10:17.240
I think I'll just take a nap.

10:18.809 --> 10:22.000
- Who is it?
- It's me. Mom.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.559
Oh, come in. Randy.

10:24.609 --> 10:27.519
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

10:27.609 --> 10:31.200
Come give me a hug.

10:31.289 --> 10:34.399
Mmm. I'm much better now.

10:34.490 --> 10:37.959
I've got a great joke for you. You can
use it in your speech, if you want.

10:38.089 --> 10:39.760
Oh. OK. Shoot.

10:43.609 --> 10:46.479
OK, l got it,

10:46.569 --> 10:49.800
If a snake married an undertaker.

10:49.890 --> 10:51.919
what would their towels say?

10:52.050 --> 10:56.560
A snake and an undertaker.
I don't know. What?

10:56.649 --> 10:58.950
"Hiss" and "hearse".

11:01.209 --> 11:03.200
That's good.
That's really good.

11:03.289 --> 11:05.479
Maybe I could work it into
the beginning of my speech.

11:05.569 --> 11:08.080
Randy!

11:08.729 --> 11:10.120
What are you doing in here?

11:10.209 --> 11:12.319
You're supposed to be downstairs
helping me get finished dusting.

11:12.410 --> 11:17.120
I'm just up here telling Mom a joke.
I'm being a good son.

11:17.209 --> 11:19.560
Bull. You're just trying
to stay out of work.

11:19.649 --> 11:23.600
- Am not.
- Are too.

11:25.850 --> 11:28.359
That was pretty good. Mom.

11:28.450 --> 11:32.720
I'm not gonna finish this
unless you stop interrupting me.

11:32.810 --> 11:35.399
- I was just trying to help.
- Kissing up, huh?

11:35.490 --> 11:36.839
- Am not.
- Are too.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.680
Enough. Enough! Enough.

11:39.769 --> 11:42.479
Now, how's your dad doing
with all that housecleaning?

11:42.569 --> 11:44.919
- OK.
- Yeah. OK.

11:45.010 --> 11:47.720
I don't like the looks of that look.
What's going on?

11:47.810 --> 11:51.800
- Nothing.
- Dad's not doing anything.

11:51.890 --> 11:54.640
What exactly is Dad not doing?

11:54.729 --> 11:57.030
He's not rewiring the vacuum.

11:57.129 --> 11:58.680
- No, Mom…
- Mom!

11:58.769 --> 12:02.120
- Tim!
- finish your speech?

12:02.209 --> 12:05.039
- Where is it?
- Hmm?

12:05.129 --> 12:07.120
Ahh.

12:08.330 --> 12:11.319
You know where it is.
Same place it's always been.

12:18.209 --> 12:21.560
I'm serious.
Where is the vacuum cleaner?

12:21.649 --> 12:25.999
Oh, you mean the Daisy Soft Sweep
Decor Model in burnt almond?

12:26.129 --> 12:28.760
- That's the one.
- I think you're gonna like what we did.

12:28.850 --> 12:31.120
Mark, plug her in.

12:37.289 --> 12:39.439
Well, that doesn't look too bad.

12:39.530 --> 12:44.959
On the outside.
it maintains that feminine allure.

12:45.089 --> 12:48.479
On the inside.
I've doubled its chromosome count.

12:48.569 --> 12:52.319
- Did you rewire it?
- I tweaked it.

12:54.169 --> 12:55.720
Well, it sounds the same.

12:55.810 --> 13:00.200
That's because it's in the "whisper" mode.
for light cleaning.

13:00.289 --> 13:02.560
If you want to get the deep-down dirt.

13:02.649 --> 13:07.399
we turn to the new "power suck" mode.

13:17.850 --> 13:19.760
I thought you guys
were staying at the park.

13:19.850 --> 13:22.359
Jennifer left.
so Brad didn't want to stay.

13:22.450 --> 13:25.280
I guess the car air freshener
wasn't a big hit, huh?

13:25.370 --> 13:28.280
She said I smelled like her dog
after he had a shampoo.

13:28.370 --> 13:31.800
Brad. Brad. Come here.

13:31.890 --> 13:33.720
Come here.
Tell me what happened.

13:33.810 --> 13:36.109
- I think she likes me.
- How do you know?

13:36.209 --> 13:39.439
She hit me in the arm, mice.

13:39.530 --> 13:41.039
- Hard?
- Yeah!

13:41.169 --> 13:43.550
- You're in, dude.
- Dude.

13:45.609 --> 13:47.910
- Hey. Wilson.
- Hmm.

13:48.010 --> 13:51.280
- What are you doing?
- Just carving out a canoe, Tim.

13:58.970 --> 14:01.640
- Sounds hard.
- Not really, Tim.

14:01.729 --> 14:05.919
You just take a big block of wood and
chip away everything that's not a canoe.

14:09.050 --> 14:11.640
Say. Wilson, are you afraid
of speaking in public?

14:11.729 --> 14:14.760
To be honest with you, Tim.
I don't go out in public.

14:17.289 --> 14:21.560
Ah. Jill's got to give a speech today
and she's really concerned about it.

14:21.679 --> 14:25.460
- Perfectly natural.
- It's not natural. I like speaking in public.

14:25.559 --> 14:26.539
I talk all the time.

14:26.639 --> 14:28.470
Some days I get in conversations
with people I don't even know.

14:28.559 --> 14:30.909
- l mean. I'll talk and talk. Sometimes I…
- Tim.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.870
- What?
- I get the point.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.389
I want to help her. I just wonder what she's
so concerned about, speaking in public.

14:37.480 --> 14:40.750
Well, she's probably just afraid
of appearing foolish in public.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.629
I believe it was Samuel Clemens
who said…

14:42.720 --> 14:44.029
Samuel Clemens?

14:44.120 --> 14:46.070
You'd know him better as Mark Twain.

14:46.159 --> 14:49.669
but that was just a pseudonym.
a sobriquet.

14:49.759 --> 14:53.629
Of course - a pseudonym, a sobriquet.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.389
Spell one of those. Pick one. Just…

14:56.480 --> 14:58.860
- Let's just say pen name, Tim.
- OK.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.830
Anyway, he said:

15:00.919 --> 15:03.750
"Better to have people think you're a fool.

15:03.840 --> 15:07.710
than to open your mouth
and remove all doubt."

15:12.840 --> 15:15.399
My, my, my, my.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.389
What do you think about that, Tim?

15:18.480 --> 15:20.669
Tim .

15:23.279 --> 15:27.149
B-L-A before B-L-U.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.830
Blue, blue…
Brown. B-R…

15:29.919 --> 15:32.909
That's easy.
Brown, brown…

15:33.399 --> 15:35.269
- Hi. I made you some tea.
- Hi.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.350
- Oh, thank you.
- How's it going?

15:37.440 --> 15:39.950
It's going great.
I'm just working on my speech.

15:40.039 --> 15:41.950
I can see that.

15:42.039 --> 15:45.230
You know. Jill.
I think I've got the problem licked.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.710
Best summed up by this wonderful quote:

15:48.799 --> 15:54.230
"It is better not to open your mouth
and appear foolish.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.309
than to open it and fool them."

16:03.960 --> 16:06.669
Thank you, honey.
That's a big help.

16:06.759 --> 16:08.549
It's Mark Twain.

16:08.639 --> 16:11.710
Tim. I just don't know anything
about giving a speech.

16:11.799 --> 16:13.789
I don't even know
what to do with my hands.

16:13.879 --> 16:15.230
Well, put them in your pockets.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.830
What if I wear this dress?
It doesn't have any pockets.

16:17.919 --> 16:22.230
Hey, nice-lookin'.
Well, put them down at your sides.

16:22.320 --> 16:25.309
But don't itch at yourself like that.
Don't scratch.

16:25.399 --> 16:29.429
- How's this?
- You look like a totem pole.

16:29.519 --> 16:32.789
Loosen up.
Come on. Loosen up. Do this.

16:35.639 --> 16:38.789
- Do it.
- I don't think this is gonna help, Tim.

16:38.879 --> 16:41.909
You're right, but it's fun
watching you do that.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.350
Tim!

16:44.440 --> 16:46.740
Don't think of the audience as a group.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.190
When I first did Tool Time.
I was petrified.

16:49.279 --> 16:51.950
so I tried to visualize it
as just one person.

16:52.039 --> 16:55.870
The first time you did Tool Time
there was just one person.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.909
That's not my point.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.950
I tried to visualize that person
as being in their underwear.

17:01.039 --> 17:03.789
- He was in his underwear.
- He was not.

17:06.279 --> 17:09.670
The speech isn't the problem.
What is going on here?

17:09.759 --> 17:12.710
Tim. I'm gonna be standing up there
in front of 250 people.

17:12.799 --> 17:16.500
That's 500 eyes watching me.

17:16.598 --> 17:19.910
500 ears listening to me.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.700
Ugh. That's 1.000 organs.
No wonder you're nervous.

17:24.559 --> 17:29.500
You know, I am the only speaker,
and by standing up there,

17:29.599 --> 17:33.630
it's like I'm saying that
I'm the most important person in the room.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.549
- Well, you are.
- Well. I don't feel like it.

17:37.640 --> 17:43.630
It's not like I'm the president of anything.
I don't run a corporation.

17:43.720 --> 17:48.109
I'm not a celebrity. I'm just your wife.
and Brad. Randy and Mark's mother.

17:48.240 --> 17:52.950
You're the chairperson of
the most successful money laundering…

17:53.039 --> 17:58.269
- fundraising!
- …fundraising drives in library history.

17:58.359 --> 18:01.980
You're CEO of this family.
You're my Career mana9er,

18:02.079 --> 18:04.640
- and you're a life manager.
- Life manager?

18:04.720 --> 18:08.390
- You manage to live your life with me.
- I should get an award for that.

18:08.480 --> 18:11.039
You should get an award
for the money that you collected.

18:11.119 --> 18:12.309
Come on in.

18:13.039 --> 18:15.670
Here. Mommy.
I made you a milkshake.

18:15.759 --> 18:18.670
Oh, thank you, honey!

18:18.759 --> 18:21.319
It looks like -
What did you put in that?

18:21.400 --> 18:23.859
Peanut butter and jelly.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.349
Go ahead.

18:33.839 --> 18:38.700
Mmm! Mmm!
Terrific. And thick.

18:39.559 --> 18:42.430
- Have you finished your speech?
- Yeah.

18:42.519 --> 18:45.630
- Can I hear it?
- She doesn't feel like it right now.

18:45.720 --> 18:49.950
Come on. Mom. You always make me
show you my homework.

18:50.720 --> 18:53.390
Well, you're right. I do.

18:53.480 --> 18:57.230
- OK. OK, fair is fair.
- You sure you feel like doing this?

18:57.319 --> 19:00.990
Yeah. I'll just picture
you two in your underwear.

19:01.079 --> 19:03.460
No, don't take off your pants.
It's just a technique.

19:05.359 --> 19:09.710
- OK. Ahem. Are you ready?
- Yep.

19:12.039 --> 19:14.230
"Good afternoon.
It's a pleasure to be here today."

19:14.319 --> 19:16.829
- I wrote that.
- Very good.

19:16.920 --> 19:21.750
OK, OK. "As you all know, the library
is the cornerstone of a good education."

19:21.839 --> 19:25.069
"Books contain ideas
which can shape our planet.

19:25.160 --> 19:28.269
and. let's face it, right now our planet
is badly out of shape."

19:28.359 --> 19:30.630
"Shape" and "out of shape" -
I love it. It's good.

19:30.720 --> 19:34.420
Yeah? Well, it's easy in front of
you and Mark. I know you guys.

19:34.519 --> 19:39.430
- Pretend like we're the library association.
- No, most of them are women.

19:39.519 --> 19:42.710
OK, we'll be women.
Mark, come over here for a minute.

19:42.799 --> 19:46.869
- What?
- Here, these go with your hair.

19:47.359 --> 19:50.430
Oh, and these are me.

19:50.519 --> 19:52.710
- Look at that.
- Tim, what are you doing?

19:52.799 --> 19:57.190
We are supporting our woman
by being women.

19:57.839 --> 20:02.309
Mark, you don't do this
outside the house. OK?

20:03.119 --> 20:06.990
Tim, please.
You really don't have to do this.

20:08.279 --> 20:10.990
There's no Tim here any more.

20:11.079 --> 20:13.190
My name is… Ouch!

20:16.119 --> 20:20.109
My name is Linda.
and this is my good friend. Rose.

20:20.200 --> 20:24.309
- Hi. Mommy.
- Well, hello. Rose. Hello. Ouch.

20:24.400 --> 20:29.630
Hello. Well, please get on with
your speech. We're all aflutter.

20:33.599 --> 20:36.349
OK. OK.

20:36.440 --> 20:40.109
"The only way to get our planet back
into shape is to exercise our minds."

20:40.200 --> 20:44.829
"By upgrading and modernizing
our library, we can do that."

20:44.920 --> 20:49.630
Look how she gets us involved.
I love this.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.990
"Your generous dollars
have made that possible.

20:52.079 --> 20:55.700
and I hope that you will continue to
give in the future." It goes on from there.

20:55.799 --> 21:00.150
Bravo, bravo.
Give her the wave.

21:00.279 --> 21:03.869
Isn't she the most spectacular
speaker you've ever seen?

21:03.960 --> 21:06.789
- It is OK, isn't it?
- It's marvelous, hon. It's marvelous.

21:06.880 --> 21:10.150
No. I'm serious.
I mean, it actually makes sense.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.799
- It's terrific. It is.
- Are you just saying that?

21:12.880 --> 21:16.829
- No, it's good.
- So it was good, but not terrific?

21:16.920 --> 21:19.670
Huh? No. That's the same, isn't it?

21:19.759 --> 21:23.230
No, no, no, no.
"Good" means that it's OK.

21:23.319 --> 21:27.829
"Terrific" means that
I'd be a fool not to give this speech.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.710
You would be a fool
not to give this speech.

21:32.720 --> 21:36.230
OK, then. I'll give it.
Thank you. Linda.

21:36.319 --> 21:38.470
Thank you. Rose.

21:41.480 --> 21:46.190
Rather unprofessional
to kiss us like that, wasn't it?

21:46.279 --> 21:49.430
Do you suppose that's her real hair color?

21:49.519 --> 21:51.950
I don't think so.
Look at the roots.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.980
Ever got some phlegm caught in
your throat and you can't get it out?

21:57.079 --> 21:59.750
You just don't see old women
going like this, do you?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.829
- I'm here.
- Oh, good, Tim, we're on in a minute.

22:14.920 --> 22:16.589
Where've you been, Tim?
I was getting worried.

22:16.680 --> 22:18.430
We were watching Mommy
give her speech.

22:18.519 --> 22:21.109
- She wowed them at the library.
- I did all right.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.789
- How you doin', Al?
- Hi, Jill.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.950
You wowed them.
They asked you back for next year already.

22:25.039 --> 22:27.829
Oh. God.
I don't want to think about that.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.789
- Hi. Mark. How are you?
- Good.

22:30.880 --> 22:35.069
- Do anything fun this weekend?
- Daddy and I dressed up like women.

22:36.599 --> 22:39.509
- Oh, really?
- It's not like it sounds. Al.

22:39.599 --> 22:43.549
Daddy had Mommy's hat on
and we both wore earrings.

22:43.640 --> 22:47.339
Well, of course, earrings
would complete the ensemble.

22:47.440 --> 22:51.109
Music. Stand by,
here we go, everybody.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.710
It's not like I had a bra on or anything, Al.

22:53.799 --> 22:56.150
Well, maybe next time, Tim.

22:56.759 --> 22:58.829
Does everyone know what time it is?

22:58.920 --> 23:01.430
It's Tool Time!
