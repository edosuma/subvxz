WEBVTT

00:07.890 --> 00:10.519
We're going. That's it.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.939
Paul, it's too dangerous.

00:12.940 --> 00:15.729
There are 1,000 of these
next-gen ceramic water filters

00:15.730 --> 00:18.019
arriving in Kinshasa tomorrow.

00:18.020 --> 00:21.059
If Paul and I aren't there,
200 will be lost in a warehouse,

00:21.060 --> 00:23.889
and a further 50 will be
inspected and never returned.

00:23.890 --> 00:25.269
And if you are there,

00:25.270 --> 00:27.849
Mkono Wa Kifo will try to kill you.

00:27.850 --> 00:29.229
We're only going for five days.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.439
Julien can take of it.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.979
You both are too important to lose.

00:32.980 --> 00:35.809
We're not important.
The work is important.

00:37.850 --> 00:39.479
She'll be here in a minute.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.479
David... we really
appreciate your concern,

00:42.480 --> 00:44.769
but we can't let
the Hand of Death scare us.

00:44.770 --> 00:46.149
We'll stay safe.

00:51.020 --> 00:53.019
Oh, Celina!

00:53.020 --> 00:54.149
Hey.

00:54.150 --> 00:55.838
How's our baby doing?

00:55.839 --> 00:57.809
Let's get you inside, love.

00:57.810 --> 00:59.189
Okay, great.

00:59.190 --> 01:00.269
Hey, Sarah.

01:00.270 --> 01:02.538
- Ã‡a va?
- Hi, Celina.

01:04.769 --> 01:07.059
Oh, he's so beautiful.

01:07.587 --> 01:09.099
What about those headaches?

01:09.507 --> 01:11.099
Uh... no better, I'm afraid.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.889
Well, what's the obstetrician say?

01:12.890 --> 01:14.479
That we need to keep an eye on her.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.849
You should go to Africa without me.

01:16.850 --> 01:19.939
Oh, Sarah, they need your help
more than I do.

01:19.940 --> 01:22.559
Listen, you've given me
my own private nurse.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.939
How many people get that?

01:23.940 --> 01:26.689
I feel like
I'm a Kardashian or something.

01:26.690 --> 01:28.059
I'm just sorry for making you nervous

01:28.060 --> 01:29.979
about all of these health complaints.

01:29.980 --> 01:32.440
Don't ever say the "S" word again,
not after what you've done.

01:39.043 --> 01:40.310
Wait!

01:42.424 --> 01:44.229
Fresh from the garden.

01:44.230 --> 01:47.649
Dr. Sarah is prescribing
plenty of veggie smoothies.

01:47.650 --> 01:48.939
Awesome. Thank you.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.889
I'll make one as soon as I get home.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074

02:08.889 --> 02:11.520
Whoa!

02:13.020 --> 02:14.849
Hey!

02:44.060 --> 02:45.689
Thank God you're here.

02:45.690 --> 02:47.439
This is my wife, Sarah.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.649
- Hey.
- Thank you so much for coming.

02:48.650 --> 02:51.019
This is my team...
Oliver Yates, profiler,

02:51.020 --> 02:53.439
- Zara Hallam, security expert...
- Right.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.439
...and my second... Maxine Carlson.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.349
- Hi.
- Hi, there.

02:57.350 --> 02:59.149
I-I'm... I'm sure
our insurance company told you

02:59.150 --> 03:03.059
that the surrogate mother
of our baby, Celina Walker,

03:03.060 --> 03:05.689
was abducted at gunpoint yesterday.

03:05.690 --> 03:06.979
Yes, t-they let her nurse go,

03:06.980 --> 03:10.019
but told her
if we called the police then...

03:10.020 --> 03:13.809
Well, it would be
difficult to call anyway.

03:13.810 --> 03:15.599
Because surrogacy is illegal in France.

03:15.600 --> 03:16.769
We understand.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.649
There hasn't been a demand yet,

03:19.650 --> 03:21.849
but Noelle, the nurse,
said they would be in contact.

03:21.850 --> 03:24.059
So you think she was taken
in order to hurt you?

03:24.502 --> 03:27.349
Have you heard of Mkono Wa Kifo?

03:27.350 --> 03:29.769
It's Swahili for "Hand of Death"...

03:29.770 --> 03:33.599
an extremist insurgency group
out of central Africa.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.689
- Not nice guys.
- We were supposed to be

03:35.690 --> 03:38.059
in Kinshasa today, delivering filters,

03:38.060 --> 03:40.349
providing clean drinking water
for thousands of villagers.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.979
Over the past few years,
the Hand of Death have

03:41.980 --> 03:44.809
carried out vicious attacks
against our NGO...

03:44.810 --> 03:48.229
issued threats to Sarah
and me, personally.

03:48.230 --> 03:50.229
I have a trust fund. I'll empty it out.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.809
But if the Hand of Death has Celina,

03:51.810 --> 03:55.020
the only currency
that they accept is... blood.

04:17.019 --> 04:19.349
Hello?

04:19.350 --> 04:22.479
Hello?!

04:22.480 --> 04:25.809
Help!

04:37.175 --> 04:45.676
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

04:49.059 --> 04:52.978
Our suspects, Hand of Death,
are remorseless...

04:52.979 --> 04:54.688
torture, beheading, rape.

04:54.689 --> 04:56.558
Clue's in the name, huh?

04:56.559 --> 04:59.558
So, I reached out
to our associates in Africa.

04:59.559 --> 05:02.188
They're trying to confirm
with intermediaries

05:02.189 --> 05:04.188
that they did, in fact, take Celina.

05:04.189 --> 05:05.438
But you're doubtful.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.695
I mean, these guys
are bad news, absolutely,

05:07.696 --> 05:09.395
and they probably hate the Clarkes,

05:09.396 --> 05:11.308
but even though they've
killed thousands locally,

05:11.309 --> 05:13.529
they've never reached
outside central Africa.

05:13.530 --> 05:16.938
And I had Annie skim through
the EU Border Patrol Databases.

05:16.939 --> 05:19.108
There's no record of any suspected

05:19.109 --> 05:20.308
Hand of Death affiliates

05:20.309 --> 05:22.632
having entered Europe in the past year.

05:22.633 --> 05:25.366
So... surrogacy is illegal here.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.812
Anyone else uncomfortable with the fact

05:26.813 --> 05:29.648
that we're working for people
who've broken the law?

05:29.649 --> 05:31.848
That baby boy that Celina is carrying

05:31.849 --> 05:33.408
is innocent, Maxine.

05:34.109 --> 05:36.898
- He's our client.
- Yeah, but who even knew

05:36.899 --> 05:38.572
that the baby belonged to the Clarkes?

05:38.573 --> 05:40.828
They've had to been
pretty discreet about it.

05:40.829 --> 05:43.518
Well, that's what we got
to find out and fast.

05:43.519 --> 05:44.938
Celina's apparently been suffering

05:44.939 --> 05:46.108
from headaches and high blood pressure

05:46.109 --> 05:47.108
for the past month.

05:47.109 --> 05:48.688
That's why they hired her the nurse.

05:48.689 --> 05:50.768
Well, they're thinking pre-eclampsia.

05:50.769 --> 05:51.710
What's that?

05:51.711 --> 05:53.656
It's a malfunction of the placenta.

05:53.657 --> 05:56.593
If eclampsia's confirmed,
it could kill her and the baby

05:56.594 --> 05:58.548
if delivery isn't induced right away.

05:58.656 --> 06:00.785
So, what's our strategy?

06:00.786 --> 06:04.535
Well, we need to find her fast,
so we divide and conquer.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.825
Can you describe the men
who took Celina?

06:07.826 --> 06:09.995
Anything could be useful, Noelle.

06:09.996 --> 06:11.634
I was very scared.

06:12.784 --> 06:16.575
Two men came out
of the first car, both white,

06:16.576 --> 06:18.945
and then behind, uh... two more men.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.575
- Black, I think.
- Can you tell me anything else...

06:21.576 --> 06:23.785
uh... tall, short? Anything?

06:23.786 --> 06:25.548
I have to go to work.

06:25.946 --> 06:27.365
You can walk with me.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.035
I can't believe this is happening.

06:37.444 --> 06:39.035
Can you show me some of the threats

06:39.036 --> 06:41.339
the Hand of Death have made against you?

06:41.340 --> 06:42.782
Of course.

06:44.246 --> 06:45.945
How well did you know Celina?

06:46.604 --> 06:49.365
I worked with her for a month,
since the headaches began.

06:49.366 --> 06:51.825
Can you think of anyone who may
have wanted to harm her...

06:51.826 --> 06:55.035
old acquaintances, an ex-boyfriend?

06:55.510 --> 06:57.655
Did she know many people in Nice?

06:57.656 --> 07:00.365
- I don't know. I don't think so.
- Okay, Ms. Alli, please.

07:00.366 --> 07:03.155
Do you think there's any chance
Celina wanted to run away?

07:03.156 --> 07:04.785
I-I don't know.

07:04.786 --> 07:06.995
How did you meet Celina?

07:06.996 --> 07:09.615
She was waitressing
in our favorite bistro.

07:09.616 --> 07:12.155
She had just arrived in the country.

07:12.156 --> 07:14.549
We liked her, then we became friends.

07:15.465 --> 07:18.405
She watched us go through IVF treatment,

07:18.406 --> 07:21.928
and it's just disappointment
after disappointment.

07:23.632 --> 07:26.615
And then, two years ago,
we had a stillbirth.

07:26.616 --> 07:28.535
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:28.996 --> 07:30.155
And then one night, she just...

07:30.156 --> 07:32.905
She just told us
that she wanted to help us.

07:32.906 --> 07:36.906
Celina had offered us a chance
to make our dreams come true.

07:38.866 --> 07:41.303
I mean, we took every precaution.

07:41.906 --> 07:44.285
We got her an apartment
to keep things quiet,

07:44.286 --> 07:46.325
did the IVF treatment in Spain,

07:46.326 --> 07:48.535
and we hired Noelle
when she started feeling unwell.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.115
I mean, everything to keep her safe.

07:50.116 --> 07:52.995
Somehow, the dream's
just become a nightmare.

07:52.996 --> 07:55.728
They left 100 of them in our offices.

07:56.406 --> 08:01.405
They sent thousands of e-mails,
horrible photos.

08:01.406 --> 08:03.035
Not just threats, of course.

08:03.303 --> 08:05.865
I was there when
they fire-bombed our offices

08:05.866 --> 08:07.727
in Kinshasa three years ago.

08:09.036 --> 08:11.075
But, uh... nothing ever
came to your home?

08:11.076 --> 08:12.446
No.

09:10.536 --> 09:12.297
I checked through Celina's apartment.

09:12.298 --> 09:15.745
Couldn't find much...
but that's maybe because

09:15.746 --> 09:17.405
someone else had been through it first.

09:17.406 --> 09:19.205
I'm guessing they were
looking for her passport

09:19.206 --> 09:20.695
since I couldn't find it.

09:20.696 --> 09:23.417
Maybe they're planning
on taking her somewhere.

09:25.906 --> 09:26.905
Eric.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.923
Okay, contact.

09:38.496 --> 09:39.945
Hello?

09:39.946 --> 09:41.353
Paul Clarke?

09:41.354 --> 09:44.035
No, this is Eric Beaumont
of Crisis Resolution.

09:44.442 --> 09:45.654
We have Celina.

09:45.655 --> 09:49.245
Okay, and just out of interest,
who are "We"?

09:49.246 --> 09:51.995
We're the ones who talk.
You're the ones who listen.

09:51.996 --> 09:53.995
The Clarkes cannot go to the police

09:53.996 --> 09:57.331
to report Celina's abduction,
but we have a solution...

09:57.332 --> 09:59.825
$5 million in a Swiss bank account

09:59.826 --> 10:00.844
by noon tomorrow.

10:00.869 --> 10:02.785
Proof of life will arrive shortly.

10:02.786 --> 10:03.786
Goodbye.

10:07.116 --> 10:10.075
$5 million?

10:10.546 --> 10:14.995
We can't get $5 million,
not by noon tomorrow.

10:24.446 --> 10:27.076
Who are you? Why am I here?

10:30.826 --> 10:34.155
Please, stay calm.
It's for you and your baby.

10:36.055 --> 10:39.995
What are you doing?! Help!

10:39.996 --> 10:41.365
I have to do this.

11:07.990 --> 11:10.989
That's proof of life.

11:10.990 --> 11:12.899
What have they done to her?

11:12.900 --> 11:15.767
And this came with it.

11:21.841 --> 11:23.610
The baby!

11:26.186 --> 11:27.686
I need some air.

11:42.780 --> 11:46.149
We should talk about this demand.

11:46.746 --> 11:50.319
Our ransom insurance provides
up to a million dollars.

11:50.320 --> 11:53.026
There's roughly another million
in my wife's trust.

11:53.320 --> 11:56.399
To get to five,
we'd have to sell the house.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.239
We can't do that by noon tomorrow.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.649
We need to know who we're dealing with.

12:00.650 --> 12:03.239
And it seems very unlikely
it's the Hand of Death.

12:03.240 --> 12:06.139
Is there any light
that you could shed on it?

12:07.843 --> 12:09.029
No.

12:09.802 --> 12:11.819
I don't believe you, Mr. Clarke.

12:13.146 --> 12:14.609
Why would I lie?

12:14.610 --> 12:17.399
Well, I'm not saying
you're lying... per se,

12:17.400 --> 12:19.949
but you are holding back.

12:20.314 --> 12:22.949
Do you know what a person's
cognitive load is?

12:22.950 --> 12:24.989
It's the maximum amount of information

12:24.990 --> 12:27.029
that you can process at any one time.

12:27.030 --> 12:28.989
Now, if you exceed it,

12:28.990 --> 12:32.029
your brain starts shutting down
nonessential functions,

12:32.030 --> 12:34.456
like twirling that pen
around your fingers.

12:35.950 --> 12:38.067
It's a very simple question.

12:38.570 --> 12:40.150
You shouldn't have to think about it.

12:44.506 --> 12:46.359
Two weeks ago...

12:47.021 --> 12:48.449
Celina threatened to go to the police

12:48.450 --> 12:53.093
unless I paid her off,
said we'd never get the baby.

12:53.860 --> 12:58.253
It came totally out of the blue.
She's not like that.

12:58.860 --> 13:02.109
I couldn't tell Sarah.
She'd be devastated.

13:02.110 --> 13:04.359
Why didn't you say anything before?

13:04.360 --> 13:08.239
Celina obviously hasn't gone
and staged her own kidnapping.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.442
Did she say what prompted her
to ask for the money?

13:10.443 --> 13:11.449
No.

13:11.450 --> 13:12.987
She has nothing really...

13:13.860 --> 13:15.359
except what she makes from waitressing.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.149
But to threaten you, Mr. Clarke,

13:17.150 --> 13:20.989
as you say, it's... out of character.

13:30.990 --> 13:32.189
What are you doing?

13:32.815 --> 13:34.447
I have a headache.

13:35.570 --> 13:37.480
I need to see the doctor.

13:37.990 --> 13:39.189
Please.

13:39.190 --> 13:41.189
Please!

13:41.190 --> 13:43.329
My baby could die.

13:44.070 --> 13:46.069
Look, the Clarkes, they have money.

13:46.070 --> 13:47.319
You have to help me.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.359
They can give you
whatever it is that you want.

13:49.699 --> 13:51.118
Please.

13:53.860 --> 13:56.110
Please!

14:00.860 --> 14:04.109
Oliver said she was being evasive.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.109
Still no answer.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.649
Yeah, Noelle's hiding something.

14:06.650 --> 14:08.489
She may be our only link to Celina.

14:08.490 --> 14:10.319
See if you can find her
and convince her to talk.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.949
I'll wait here a little longer.

14:11.950 --> 14:13.030
Okay.

14:15.150 --> 14:16.819
Maybe try the hospital.

14:18.612 --> 14:21.491
Celina's blood pressure has risen.

14:22.110 --> 14:25.149
Well, that's hardly surprising.
She's under a lot of stress.

14:26.150 --> 14:28.319
Probably 'cause
she's just been abducted.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.949
I took a blood sample.
I can take it to the lab...

14:29.950 --> 14:31.449
No.

14:32.181 --> 14:33.859
No blood sample.

14:33.860 --> 14:36.609
I won't let some
lab technician blow this.

14:36.610 --> 14:38.399
Okay. D'accord.

14:38.820 --> 14:40.819
But if something happens
to her or the baby,

14:40.820 --> 14:42.489
it's not kidnapping, it's murder.

14:42.490 --> 14:44.739
Well, just remember, if she dies,

14:44.740 --> 14:47.739
there's just as much blood
on your hands as mine.

14:47.740 --> 14:49.854
You're being well paid.

15:00.860 --> 15:02.680
Good afternoon, Celina.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.399
I'm sorry to hear
you're not feeling well.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.609
And I'm sorry for this...
unpleasantness.

15:08.610 --> 15:12.189
It's temporary, of course.
I don't want to harm you.

15:12.190 --> 15:14.239
In fact, I want to take you

15:14.240 --> 15:17.239
to a fantastic
private hospital tomorrow.

15:17.240 --> 15:18.239
Take me there now.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.319
Uh, let me finish.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.739
And afterwards,
when you deliver the baby,

15:22.740 --> 15:25.239
I want to give you
a half a million euros.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.399
All you have to do is give up the baby.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.399
I can't do that.

15:29.400 --> 15:33.189
It's not your baby, Celina.
It was never meant to be.

15:33.190 --> 15:34.989
You can always have another one.

15:38.240 --> 15:41.449
Okay. I see you're gonna need some time.

15:41.450 --> 15:43.936
But this is a good deal I'm offering,

15:44.530 --> 15:49.319
and the longer you resist,
the greater risk to that child.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.899
In a few hours, you'll realize

15:50.900 --> 15:52.570
there's really only one option here.

15:57.570 --> 15:59.689
Who are you?!

16:24.150 --> 16:25.024
Zara.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.949
Eric, we found no encrypted data

16:26.950 --> 16:28.739
in the e-mails or proof-of-life photo.

16:28.740 --> 16:29.899
They were scrubbed clean.

16:29.900 --> 16:31.899
And I can't get anything
from the recording,

16:31.900 --> 16:33.949
not even the program
used to disguise it.

16:33.950 --> 16:36.739
I'm really hoping this is all
just preamble to the good news.

16:36.740 --> 16:40.529
Whoever this guy is,
he's uber-professional, right?

16:40.530 --> 16:44.609
So we started looking into
Paul's past with his charity,

16:44.610 --> 16:49.239
and we turned up something...
pretty spicy.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.400
I like spicy.

16:52.490 --> 16:55.859
This is Dylan Figgis.

16:55.860 --> 16:57.189
Oh, God.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.522
Old pal of yours?

16:58.950 --> 17:01.358
Uh... he's just a fixer for hire,

17:01.359 --> 17:02.859
pretends to be legitimate.

17:02.860 --> 17:04.449
We used his services until we found out

17:04.450 --> 17:06.189
the truth about him.

17:06.190 --> 17:07.358
Three years ago,

17:07.359 --> 17:09.648
he was up before
a U.S. Senate subcommittee.

17:09.650 --> 17:12.108
One of a litany of things
he and his company

17:12.109 --> 17:16.689
were accused of was...
aggravated kidnapping.

17:16.690 --> 17:19.689
He only narrowly avoided jail,

17:19.690 --> 17:23.343
but they did strip away licenses
from his business, seize assets,

17:23.344 --> 17:25.949
and your testimony against him
was key to that, Mr. Clarke.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.189
Do you think he took her?

17:28.190 --> 17:31.239
Lots of people testified
against Figgis, not just me.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.279
He flew into Nice International Airport

17:33.280 --> 17:34.279
four days ago.

17:34.280 --> 17:35.569
Awfully big coincidence.

17:35.570 --> 17:37.859
You have any way to contact Mr. Figgis?

17:37.860 --> 17:39.449
I can ask.

17:39.450 --> 17:41.449
Someone will have
a phone number for him.

17:41.450 --> 17:45.819
Okay, good, but you can't pay
the $5 million demand, correct?

17:45.820 --> 17:48.399
Not by noon tomorrow. Impossible.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.071
But we can negotiate, Mr. Beaumont.

17:50.072 --> 17:52.569
I can, but the success of a negotiation

17:52.570 --> 17:56.649
usually depend on building trust
with the hostage taker.

17:56.650 --> 17:59.681
Mr. Dylan Figgis trusts no one.

17:59.682 --> 18:02.376
So, if he took Celina,
then how do we get her back?

18:02.377 --> 18:04.429
Well, we'll use a strategy
called "Positionism."

18:04.454 --> 18:05.929
We express our position,

18:05.954 --> 18:08.743
and we don't budge until he accepts

18:09.043 --> 18:10.874
without any real compensation given.

18:10.899 --> 18:12.518
But why would he agree to that?

18:12.633 --> 18:14.632
Because there's reason to believe

18:14.657 --> 18:17.990
Celina urgently requires
medical attention, Mr. Clarke.

18:18.015 --> 18:20.974
And a hostage isn't worth much
to a hostage taker

18:21.046 --> 18:22.586
if she's dead.

18:29.616 --> 18:30.946
Merci.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.609
Bonjour, madam. Parlez vous anglais?

18:38.610 --> 18:40.029
Um... just a little.

18:40.030 --> 18:42.857
I'm looking for Noelle Alli.
She works here part time, right?

18:42.858 --> 18:43.983
Mm-hmm.

18:43.984 --> 18:45.592
Do you have any idea
how I might reach her?

18:45.593 --> 18:47.165
Oh, maybe at the lab.

18:47.166 --> 18:48.251
Here.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.558
Merci beaucoup.

18:57.159 --> 18:59.158
Hey!

18:59.183 --> 19:00.958
Noelle?

19:00.983 --> 19:03.219
Okay.

19:04.696 --> 19:06.446
Merci.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.319
How is it?

19:22.279 --> 19:24.905
Lucie, may I talk to you a moment?

19:32.606 --> 19:36.050
How was your walk? Refreshing?

19:36.051 --> 19:38.050
We need to find out what's wrong.

19:38.051 --> 19:40.220
No, you need to do as I tell you.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.220
That's what I'm paying you for.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.641
Please. Feel free.

19:53.761 --> 19:55.618
It's the blood test, isn't it?

19:56.391 --> 19:57.351
Well...?

19:59.221 --> 20:02.245
She's developed eclampsia.

20:02.270 --> 20:04.519
We need to take her to a hospital
immediately.

20:04.544 --> 20:06.123
What's going on?

20:06.261 --> 20:08.470
She's going to start having convulsions,

20:08.471 --> 20:11.023
then she'll suffer a stroke
and fall into coma.

20:12.654 --> 20:14.720
They're both going to die!

20:22.987 --> 20:24.236
Lucie.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.425
Lucie, please.

20:26.450 --> 20:28.165
Please, can you just help us?

20:29.023 --> 20:30.023
Please?

20:42.856 --> 20:45.025
Hey, Dylan. Now,
I know what you're thinking.

20:45.026 --> 20:47.435
"Why are Paul and Sarah Clarke calling?"

20:47.436 --> 20:50.355
I would introduce myself,
but we've already spoken.

20:50.356 --> 20:52.775
Although I guess this time,
you're gonna sound a little less

20:52.776 --> 20:54.775
like Darth Vader with a head cold.

20:54.776 --> 20:57.985
I'm sorry. I really have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:57.986 --> 20:59.985
You know what? You seem like
a man with expensive taste.

20:59.986 --> 21:02.565
Have you eaten in any good
restaurants since you've been here?

21:02.566 --> 21:04.355
It's just me and my team
are gonna need somewhere to go

21:04.356 --> 21:05.855
right after you bring Celina back.

21:05.856 --> 21:09.217
I... think you're confusing me
with someone else.

21:09.686 --> 21:12.845
Listen, I'm gonna go.
I'm really very busy.

21:13.146 --> 21:15.315
Call location is bouncing around.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.554
It's basically untraceable.

21:16.555 --> 21:19.725
Now, it's not totally clear
to me yet exactly who

21:19.726 --> 21:21.435
you and your team are working for,

21:21.436 --> 21:24.525
but I have a message for them and you...

21:24.526 --> 21:27.895
You have asked for $5 million.

21:27.896 --> 21:31.986
I have a counteroffer... nothing.

21:34.047 --> 21:36.275
- Okay...
- You know, in fact,

21:36.276 --> 21:39.520
I'd like you to pay us
for Celina's medical treatment

21:39.521 --> 21:41.605
and, no doubt, the therapy
it's going to take

21:41.606 --> 21:42.935
to make sure she fully recovers

21:42.936 --> 21:44.646
from what you've put her through.

21:44.647 --> 21:46.470
And I'm gonna send you
the bill for that dinner

21:46.471 --> 21:48.065
me and my friends are gonna enjoy.

21:48.066 --> 21:49.935
Don't take too long to respond.

21:49.936 --> 21:52.685
We both know that this is
a time-sensitive situation.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.685
Latency and timing were totally off.

22:02.686 --> 22:03.775
It's definitely him.

22:03.776 --> 22:05.384
I've been in a lot of negotiations,

22:05.385 --> 22:08.417
but I've... never heard
anything like that.

22:08.418 --> 22:11.589
Underneath the superficial cool,
he's worried.

22:11.590 --> 22:13.236
Yeah, Figgis has a lot to lose.

22:13.263 --> 22:15.922
Normally he's operating under
some dictator's bogus authority.

22:15.923 --> 22:18.552
But on French soil, if he gets caught,

22:18.553 --> 22:20.458
he'll feel the full weight of the law.

22:20.459 --> 22:22.670
This'll force him to accelerate things.

22:22.671 --> 22:24.465
Knock on wood, make a mistake,

22:24.466 --> 22:27.383
that means we get Celina
and the baby back safe.

22:28.843 --> 22:30.673
We'll leave you to your work.

22:36.942 --> 22:39.231
Well, I think that tallies
with your theory.

22:39.232 --> 22:41.481
Noelle was at the hospital.
I'm sure of it.

22:41.482 --> 22:44.453
What if the diagnosis of
eclampsia has been confirmed?

22:44.454 --> 22:46.682
She may only have hours left.

22:46.802 --> 22:48.341
All right, see if you can find Noelle,

22:48.342 --> 22:49.961
maybe another nurse she works with.

22:49.962 --> 22:52.001
You two keep digging into Figgis.

22:52.002 --> 22:53.922
He's got to be working for someone.

22:57.006 --> 22:59.006
Oh, trying to keep busy.

23:06.252 --> 23:09.841
That's our latest initiative
to provide safe drinking water.

23:09.842 --> 23:11.461
We're trying to distribute them

23:11.462 --> 23:14.251
all across Sub-Saharan Africa
eventually.

23:14.988 --> 23:19.316
They're economic, efficient,
and environmentally friendly.

23:21.319 --> 23:23.841
Sarah, who knew Celina
was your surrogate?

23:24.333 --> 23:28.671
Me, Noelle, Celina, and Paul...
nobody else.

23:28.672 --> 23:31.244
So how could Dylan Figgis
know to target her?

23:31.592 --> 23:33.801
I have no idea. Truly.

23:34.901 --> 23:37.751
If you want to know the truth,
I blame myself.

23:38.349 --> 23:41.052
I presume you know that I... We...

23:41.962 --> 23:43.711
We had a stillbirth.

23:43.712 --> 23:46.881
I don't know if I can
explain that experience

23:46.882 --> 23:50.301
in any meaningful way,
but the labor took 10 hours.

23:50.302 --> 23:54.952
And... it was difficult,

23:54.953 --> 23:58.882
and... painful.

23:58.883 --> 24:03.842
And when it was all over,
there was just this silence.

24:07.945 --> 24:10.361
I've never been in a room so quiet.

24:12.962 --> 24:14.802
So...

24:17.962 --> 24:20.153
...when Celina volunteered...

24:24.302 --> 24:25.921
...I mean, Paul had misgivings

24:25.922 --> 24:27.301
for all the reasons you can imagine,

24:27.302 --> 24:30.711
but...

24:30.712 --> 24:32.898
...he knew how much I wanted that child.

24:34.002 --> 24:36.714
So he did everything he could
to make it happen.

24:38.172 --> 24:40.461
Must have been difficult
on your marriage.

24:40.882 --> 24:45.648
Yes, but Paul's a great man,
and he does amazing things,

24:45.649 --> 24:47.091
and I love him.

24:47.477 --> 24:51.842
Unfortunately...
love's not enough, is it?

24:53.009 --> 24:54.961
You need to really communicate

24:54.962 --> 24:58.631
or those tiny little fissures
and cracks in a marriage...

24:58.632 --> 25:00.212
I mean, they can...

25:04.002 --> 25:06.941
They can grow into something
much more dangerous.

25:29.632 --> 25:31.631
Come on. Come on.

25:35.798 --> 25:38.667
Why are you letting
that negotiator call me?

25:38.668 --> 25:40.667
I couldn't stop him.

25:40.668 --> 25:43.747
$5 million, by the way?
You know we don't have that.

25:43.748 --> 25:45.707
Well, that's cheap considering

25:45.708 --> 25:47.957
we're about to have
a dead girl on our hands.

25:47.958 --> 25:49.829
She's got the pre...

25:50.458 --> 25:52.707
Pre-so-bad-I-can't-even-pronounce-it.

25:52.708 --> 25:54.877
Oh, God. That's it then.

25:54.878 --> 25:56.297
We'll have to take her to a hospital.

25:56.298 --> 25:58.507
I'll... I'll lose everything.

25:58.508 --> 26:01.127
No, you won't.
She's not going to any hospital.

26:01.128 --> 26:03.047
I can't let her die.

26:03.048 --> 26:04.957
I'm afraid that's not your call.

26:04.958 --> 26:07.747
I... I-I can't do this.

26:07.748 --> 26:09.587
Well, Paul, look at this way...

26:09.588 --> 26:12.087
at least you won't
have to change any diapers.

26:12.088 --> 26:14.507
No, no. Listen.
We need to talk about this.

26:14.508 --> 26:15.667
Please.

26:15.668 --> 26:19.207
Lighthouse Bar in half an hour.

26:19.208 --> 26:20.797
Don't make me wait.

26:28.582 --> 26:30.417
It's for seizures.

26:30.418 --> 26:31.860
Will it stop them?

26:32.418 --> 26:34.140
For an hour or two.

26:34.867 --> 26:35.878
And then what?

26:37.997 --> 26:40.876
The baby will die
if we don't go to the hospital.

26:41.378 --> 26:42.507
I'm trying to help.

26:42.508 --> 26:44.298
Then try harder.

27:07.798 --> 27:11.207
This way. Noelle will meet us.

27:16.708 --> 27:19.338
Okay, this way.

28:01.376 --> 28:03.298
He's not here yet, huh?

28:06.389 --> 28:09.007
Man, you drove here fast.

28:09.008 --> 28:11.207
It's lucky you brought
that phone for me to follow.

28:11.208 --> 28:13.417
And, uh... this...

28:13.418 --> 28:15.609
I guess this is the one you use to...

28:15.634 --> 28:17.593
keep in touch with Mr. Figgis.

28:17.798 --> 28:19.797
I... um...

28:19.798 --> 28:21.587
He's probably gonna be here any second,

28:21.588 --> 28:24.207
so why don't you start talking
before he and his friends

28:24.208 --> 28:26.798
walk in and put a bullet
in the back of both our skulls?

28:28.508 --> 28:30.965
Okay. You okay?

28:32.918 --> 28:34.685
Not much further.

28:42.239 --> 28:43.584
Noelle?

28:43.585 --> 28:45.187
Yes?

28:45.658 --> 28:49.618
It's okay. Come on. Okay?

28:52.678 --> 28:54.678
It's a trap.

28:57.923 --> 29:00.568
All right, I tell you what, Mr. Clarke.

29:01.963 --> 29:03.196
How about I run through my theory,

29:03.197 --> 29:06.052
and you just let me know whether
I'm on the right track, okay?

29:06.518 --> 29:08.053
Look at me.

29:09.923 --> 29:13.132
I don't believe Celina tried
to extort money from you,

29:13.133 --> 29:15.826
not someone who would volunteer
to be your surrogate.

29:16.134 --> 29:18.343
But something drove you
to make a deal with the devil.

29:18.344 --> 29:19.254
So what was it?

29:20.924 --> 29:24.085
Maybe the struggle for a baby
strained your marriage.

29:24.924 --> 29:26.303
I mean, Celina was
an attractive presence

29:26.304 --> 29:28.713
in your life, in your home.

29:28.714 --> 29:32.923
She idolized you,
and one night it just happened.

29:32.924 --> 29:35.303
It was around the time
of the IVF treatment.

29:35.968 --> 29:38.003
Maybe she was worried it hadn't worked,

29:38.375 --> 29:40.832
maybe she regretted what she had done.

29:41.214 --> 29:43.593
Everything was in flux,
emotions were running high,

29:43.594 --> 29:46.800
and you two... had sex.

29:47.896 --> 29:50.174
That probably only happened once.

29:51.914 --> 29:53.547
And when it became clear

29:53.572 --> 29:55.253
that she was pregnant,

29:55.254 --> 29:57.691
she thought she could forget about it.

29:58.094 --> 30:02.253
I mean, she was the surrogate...
nothing more, nothing less.

30:02.254 --> 30:05.253
Celina wanted to forget
it ever happened,

30:05.254 --> 30:07.219
but she couldn't.

30:07.674 --> 30:09.883
What if the baby wasn't from the IVF?

30:09.884 --> 30:12.924
What if it was from your night together?

30:13.464 --> 30:18.843
So, she gets a DNA test,
and it's her baby...

30:19.115 --> 30:20.423
not Sarah's.

30:21.443 --> 30:23.843
I mean, Celina couldn't
give up her own baby,

30:23.844 --> 30:26.503
and she couldn't let Sarah
live with the lie.

30:26.504 --> 30:31.133
That's what she told you.
Not that she wanted money.

30:31.134 --> 30:33.503
She told you you needed
to tell the truth to Sarah,

30:33.504 --> 30:35.503
but you couldn't do that,
could you, Paul?

30:35.504 --> 30:36.963
Your wife's money,

30:36.964 --> 30:39.173
the charity you'd worked
your whole life to build...

30:39.174 --> 30:40.385
I mean, you'd lose it all.

30:40.386 --> 30:42.082
Dylan, he's going to be here.

30:42.083 --> 30:44.543
Oh, yeah. Thank you. Him.

30:44.990 --> 30:47.343
You were forced to hire a man you hate,

30:47.344 --> 30:51.543
because you knew he could
and would clean up your mess,

30:51.544 --> 30:55.383
convince Celina to disappear,
return the baby to Sarah,

30:55.384 --> 30:58.923
used your wife's trust fund
to pay for his services.

30:59.554 --> 31:01.543
But it hasn't worked out how you planed.

31:01.544 --> 31:04.093
I mean, Figgis has gone rouge.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.981
How much did you agree, originally?

31:08.182 --> 31:09.503
$2 million.

31:09.504 --> 31:13.503
Hmm. He kind of did want revenge.

31:13.504 --> 31:16.423
$5 million would... would wipe you out.

31:16.424 --> 31:19.043
But he thought you'd pay,
and maybe you would have.

31:19.044 --> 31:22.963
But unfortunately, Celina
and the baby are about to die

31:22.964 --> 31:25.947
along with those nurses
that Figgis has hired.

31:26.424 --> 31:29.086
So decide and decide quickly.

31:29.844 --> 31:32.043
Are you really ready
to sacrifice all those lives

31:32.044 --> 31:33.423
to preserve your own?

31:45.004 --> 31:46.803
Where are we going?

31:46.804 --> 31:48.214
Oh, getting you some help.

31:58.464 --> 32:00.673
I went to the bar. Where were you?

32:00.674 --> 32:04.173
That negotiator followed me.
I had to leave.

32:04.174 --> 32:05.593
So he suspects you.

32:05.594 --> 32:07.133
He can't prove anything,

32:07.134 --> 32:09.307
but he's convinced Sarah not to pay.

32:10.544 --> 32:12.133
What are we going to do?

32:15.134 --> 32:17.363
Oh, I'm taking care of things.

32:17.714 --> 32:20.923
Be at the port in one hour.
I'm bringing Celina.

32:20.924 --> 32:23.963
And also, I'm a little short on cash.

32:23.964 --> 32:26.503
Whatever you can spare.

32:38.926 --> 32:40.543
What now?

32:40.544 --> 32:42.118
We've got an hour.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.360
Time for you to have a talk
with your wife.

33:06.094 --> 33:10.044
Sarah, please try to understand.

33:13.004 --> 33:15.423
Oh, my God!

33:15.424 --> 33:16.503
Please.

33:37.895 --> 33:39.464
Okay, look alive. Game time.

34:00.879 --> 34:02.614
Get them on the boat.

34:03.244 --> 34:04.364
Paul?

34:10.527 --> 34:12.299
What's on the boat?

34:13.020 --> 34:14.527
The answer to all our problems.

34:15.344 --> 34:16.803
Now, have you got what I need?

34:17.667 --> 34:20.043
200,000 euros.

34:24.889 --> 34:27.149
That'll do... for now.

34:27.304 --> 34:29.091
What's going to happen to them?

34:29.116 --> 34:31.114
Paul...

34:31.464 --> 34:33.424
I think you know.

34:35.844 --> 34:37.713
Okay, go, go, go, go, go!

34:40.754 --> 34:42.592
She's really not well. Please.

34:42.594 --> 34:43.713
Shh.

34:53.304 --> 34:54.630
Dylan Figgis?

34:55.574 --> 34:56.614
Eric Beaumont.

34:59.384 --> 35:00.884
Nice to meet you in person, finally.

35:03.473 --> 35:04.562
You think I won't shoot?

35:04.587 --> 35:06.207
Oh, I'm absolutely sure you would.

35:08.099 --> 35:09.599
- Stay quiet.
- You okay?

35:10.990 --> 35:13.359
You're wondering, "What's he doing?

35:13.607 --> 35:15.066
Why isn't he afraid?"

35:15.091 --> 35:17.300
You're thinking so much,
you're finding it hard to act.

35:17.325 --> 35:18.965
You're reaching the edge
of your cognitive load.

35:18.990 --> 35:20.983
Don't feel bad. There's a lot
of it going around.

35:22.492 --> 35:25.241
- She's really bad.
- I know.

35:25.634 --> 35:27.253
You're wondering "Is there a sniper?

35:27.254 --> 35:28.673
Is someone about to shoot?"

35:28.674 --> 35:30.604
Let me spare you the suspense.
There isn't.

35:30.605 --> 35:33.463
I don't... threaten lives. I save them.

35:33.464 --> 35:35.858
It is my one and only priority.

35:35.859 --> 35:38.031
- Can we go now?
- Not yet.

35:38.072 --> 35:42.651
The basis of a negotiation is
identifying a common interest,

35:42.652 --> 35:44.401
but you're only interest is yourself.

35:44.402 --> 35:46.321
That narrows my options.

35:46.802 --> 35:50.321
Luckily, what's best for you
is also what's best for Celina.

35:50.322 --> 35:52.133
Look behind you.

35:53.992 --> 35:56.361
Paul has very kindly signed
a written statement

35:56.362 --> 35:58.781
outlining everything the two
of you have done together.

35:58.782 --> 36:00.951
And then there is this.

36:01.770 --> 36:04.781
That'll do... for now.

36:04.782 --> 36:06.362
What's going to happen to them?

36:09.322 --> 36:11.506
I'm not going to jail.

36:11.531 --> 36:12.900
No. You're not.

36:13.812 --> 36:15.281
Because when you let us take Celina,

36:15.282 --> 36:17.401
I'm gonna let you walk away.

36:17.957 --> 36:20.491
What, you think it's a trap? It's not.

36:20.492 --> 36:23.151
A good negotiator never lies,
and like I told you,

36:23.152 --> 36:26.781
saving lives is my one
and only priority.

36:26.782 --> 36:27.781
Is she okay?

36:27.782 --> 36:29.046
She's unconscious.

36:29.047 --> 36:31.459
- We should bring her to the hospital
right away. - Okay.

36:31.460 --> 36:33.361
I don't care about rest. Here. Take it.

36:33.362 --> 36:35.781
There could be
a thousand copies of this.

36:35.782 --> 36:37.451
And there's his statement.

36:37.452 --> 36:39.579
This is the problem with psychopaths.

36:40.142 --> 36:42.351
It's so hard to build trust
with you guys.

36:42.376 --> 36:45.205
And that is why I will not
double-cross you.

36:45.230 --> 36:47.899
If I let you go now
and sell you out later,

36:47.924 --> 36:49.333
next time I've got
a situation like this...

36:49.358 --> 36:51.567
and sadly, there will be a next time...

36:51.612 --> 36:52.781
maybe they'll have heard

36:52.782 --> 36:54.451
that Eric Beaumont
doesn't keep his word.

36:55.157 --> 36:58.862
So an innocent person will die,
and I can't take that risk.

37:00.452 --> 37:04.452
So drop the gun and the money
and walk away a free man.

37:05.674 --> 37:09.134
It's a good deal, Mr. Figgis.
You should take it.

37:14.652 --> 37:17.901
Oliver, we need an ambulance now.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.670
Okay, the ambulance is on its way.

37:35.452 --> 37:36.652
Come on.

38:17.116 --> 38:18.075
Sarah...

38:18.743 --> 38:20.646
it might not seem like it now...

38:21.687 --> 38:23.486
but I did it for us.

38:24.128 --> 38:25.167
You have to believe me.

38:25.410 --> 38:28.451
Stand up... walk out...

38:28.902 --> 38:32.781
and never speak to me
or anyone I know ever again.

38:50.192 --> 38:51.571
I can't believe we're letting him

38:51.572 --> 38:53.111
and that other bastard get away.

38:53.112 --> 38:55.691
Oh, we'll be seeing
Dylan Figgis again soon.

38:56.166 --> 38:58.492
We'll make sure of that, all right?

39:00.822 --> 39:02.031
But we lost.

39:02.827 --> 39:04.491
Well, not yet we didn't.

39:14.448 --> 39:16.448
_

39:22.282 --> 39:23.959
The guest of honor has arrived.

39:29.454 --> 39:30.531
Here we are.

39:30.532 --> 39:32.821
- Oh.
- Oh, I'm so happy you could come.

39:32.822 --> 39:34.241
- Me, too.
- Oh, wow.

39:34.242 --> 39:36.281
- That's amazing.
- Thank you.

39:36.282 --> 39:38.071
Oh, no. This is the wine for me.

39:38.072 --> 39:39.753
Oh, don't worry. There's plenty more.

39:39.754 --> 39:41.821
I know how to throw
a Charity Fundraiser.

39:41.822 --> 39:44.401
We're going to get
a lot of rich people very drunk.

39:44.402 --> 39:45.651
Speaking of,

39:45.652 --> 39:47.401
I'm sure we can count
on your generosity, Eric.

39:47.402 --> 39:49.491
Well, don't get your hopes up.

39:49.492 --> 39:52.861
Dig deep. Little Eric needs
a good world to grow up in.

39:52.862 --> 39:54.241
Eric?

39:55.875 --> 39:56.861
Really?

39:57.902 --> 39:59.531
No, his name's Sebastian.

40:01.692 --> 40:03.401
Oh.

40:03.402 --> 40:05.401
Great, You invite me to speak
at your charity function,

40:05.402 --> 40:08.224
then lampoon me. Open the wine.

40:08.225 --> 40:09.281
Give me that baby.

40:14.678 --> 40:17.572
- He wants to negotiate.
- That's what we do.
