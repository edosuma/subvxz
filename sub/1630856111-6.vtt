01:32.644 --> 01:35.198
I have to say, Malky,
when Fergus said

01:35.233 --> 01:38.822
you were on the wagon,
I wasn't convinced.

01:38.857 --> 01:40.514
I'm not gonna lie.

01:40.548 --> 01:43.758
It's a rickety old wagon
with three wheels.

01:43.793 --> 01:44.759
[laughs]

01:44.794 --> 01:46.485
And the ride is bumpy.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.694
[Fergus]
Ah, you're doing great, da.

01:48.729 --> 01:51.732
-I'll get the nice biscuits.
-Ooh-ooh.

01:53.458 --> 01:55.563
You've done a great job, Malky.

01:55.598 --> 01:59.153
Look at him.
Head down in school, earning.

01:59.188 --> 02:04.227
And Liberty, ah, she's growing
up to be such a little lady.

02:04.262 --> 02:06.540
-She's a good kid.
-Who's a good kid?

02:06.574 --> 02:08.783
-Are you talking about me?
-No.

02:08.818 --> 02:12.339
We're talking about that other
girl that lives up the road.

02:12.373 --> 02:14.755
What's her name? Lily.

02:14.789 --> 02:17.309
Yeah, Lizzy.

02:17.344 --> 02:19.863
You know what we could do,
Liberty?

02:19.898 --> 02:24.627
We could go on a shopping trip
and make it a girls' day.

02:24.661 --> 02:27.733
But only if your dad agrees.
He's the boss.

02:27.768 --> 02:30.736
He's not the boss of me.
I'm the boss of me.

02:30.771 --> 02:33.463
[laughs]

02:33.498 --> 02:35.500
What do you say, Malky?

02:37.881 --> 02:39.400
[instrumental music]

02:39.435 --> 02:41.885
Say yes, daddy. Please!

02:41.920 --> 02:45.199
-Mm.
-Please?

02:45.234 --> 02:47.374
Suppose there's no harm in it.

02:48.271 --> 02:50.825
No harm in what?

02:50.860 --> 02:55.313
Paula is gonna bring Liberty
on a shopping trip sometime.

02:55.347 --> 02:59.179
[chuckles] Whoo!
Sounds good, Libs.

03:00.697 --> 03:01.802
[cell phone vibrating]

03:03.735 --> 03:05.564
Oh, shit!

03:05.599 --> 03:09.016
Sorry. It's a message from
the lads at the boxing club.

03:09.050 --> 03:10.949
I gotta go.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.640
[door opens]

03:15.333 --> 03:17.300
[Fergus]The club's chat group
is going mental.

03:17.335 --> 03:18.922
The cops are saying
it's Freddie Scatt.

03:18.957 --> 03:19.958
And who's that?

03:19.992 --> 03:21.477
He was the owner of

03:21.511 --> 03:23.272
that boxing club group
that I joined.

03:23.306 --> 03:24.618
He went missing at the weekend,

03:24.652 --> 03:26.861
and they're saying
his body parts are scattered

03:26.896 --> 03:29.657
all over the Dublin mountains
in those bags.

03:29.692 --> 03:32.453
Huh, interesting bag.

03:32.488 --> 03:34.662
I mean, it looks like
there might be a leg in there,

03:34.697 --> 03:37.078
but you find the bag
interesting?

03:37.113 --> 03:38.632
Yes, I do.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.255
How well did you know him?

03:41.290 --> 03:42.739
I knew him to see.

03:42.774 --> 03:45.294
I mean, he seemed lovely,
funny, friendly.

03:45.328 --> 03:46.571
-Everyone liked him.
-Oh.

03:46.605 --> 03:48.711
Somebody most definitely
did not like him

03:48.745 --> 03:51.783
or he would not have met
a Dionysus-end.

03:51.817 --> 03:53.854
-A what?
-Greek god.

03:53.888 --> 03:55.269
Torn apart by the Titans.

03:55.304 --> 03:57.616
They ate all of him,
bar his heart,

03:57.651 --> 03:59.342
which his mother, Semele, ate.

03:59.377 --> 04:02.725
And that allowed her
to give birth to Dionysus again.

04:02.759 --> 04:06.004
Anyway, Harry,
we should take the case.

04:06.038 --> 04:09.801
Well, take it for whom? I mean,
no one's asked us to help.

04:09.835 --> 04:13.425
Look, Harry, Freddie was a good
man by all accounts. Okay?

04:13.460 --> 04:16.946
Couldn't we at least
ask a few questions?

04:16.980 --> 04:18.810
Let me see that picture again.

04:18.844 --> 04:19.983
[instrumental music]

04:20.018 --> 04:23.090
[applause]

04:26.611 --> 04:29.476
That's Becca,
the manager of the gym.

04:29.510 --> 04:30.649
She used to fight herself.

04:30.684 --> 04:31.857
Uh, we're very grateful

04:31.892 --> 04:34.653
to be joined
by Freddie's ex-wife, Jean,

04:34.688 --> 04:37.311
who's also part owner
of the gym here.

04:37.346 --> 04:39.002
You can just say wife.

04:39.037 --> 04:42.454
Sorry. Uh, uh, wife.

04:42.489 --> 04:46.389
We've got a lovely picture
of Freddie with his proteges

04:46.424 --> 04:49.461
at a very successful
Irish Championships this year.

04:49.496 --> 04:51.394
[Jean]Oh, thank you.

04:51.429 --> 04:55.018
And, of course,
Jean's husband, Clive,

04:55.053 --> 04:57.366
and Freddie's fiancee,Wendy,

04:57.400 --> 04:59.368
and, of course,
his brother, Steve,

04:59.402 --> 05:01.093
who is about to make
his big comeback.

05:01.128 --> 05:02.612
-Come on there, Steve, man!
-Absolutely.

05:02.647 --> 05:04.821
Freddie wanted this fight
to happen

05:04.856 --> 05:06.582
and we are gonna make it happen.

05:06.616 --> 05:08.825
[applause]

05:08.860 --> 05:11.000
-Comeback fight?
-Oh. Yeah.

05:11.034 --> 05:12.760
Steve was on course
for the Olympics.

05:12.795 --> 05:14.900
But then he was a soldier
in Lebanon.

05:14.935 --> 05:16.488
Now, I don't know what happened,

05:16.523 --> 05:18.456
but the lads here say
that when he got back,

05:18.490 --> 05:20.181
he was a bit shell-shocked.

05:20.216 --> 05:23.357
Uh, God knows Freddie wasn't
much of a businessman.

05:23.392 --> 05:24.531
[laughter]

05:24.565 --> 05:25.739
But he was a brilliant coach,

05:25.773 --> 05:29.501
and more importantly,
a-a kind man.

05:29.536 --> 05:30.813
[male #1]A good soul.

05:30.847 --> 05:32.504
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

05:32.539 --> 05:34.679
[Becca] And we all know
his motto.

05:34.713 --> 05:36.405
No kid left behind.

05:36.439 --> 05:38.579
And I know
if he was here today,

05:38.614 --> 05:41.410
he'd ask you all to pick up
those skipping ropes,

05:41.444 --> 05:43.135
get in those rings
and remember him

05:43.170 --> 05:45.828
by doing what we do best, box.

05:45.862 --> 05:46.932
-Yes.
-For Freddie!

05:46.967 --> 05:48.002
[all] For Freddie!

05:48.037 --> 05:49.763
[applause]

05:49.797 --> 05:52.490
Why do you think they gave
the picture to the ex,

05:52.524 --> 05:54.630
rather than the fiancee?

05:54.664 --> 05:57.357
Sure they all live together,
don't they?

05:58.530 --> 06:00.601
Why give them two pictures?

06:00.636 --> 06:02.672
What? They all live together?

06:04.260 --> 06:06.089
How very hippy of them.

06:06.124 --> 06:09.369
Mm, reminds me
of my misspent youth.

06:10.542 --> 06:13.200
They didn't call them
the swinging '60s

06:13.234 --> 06:15.029
purely for the music, you know?

06:15.064 --> 06:18.550
Ugh! Just gave me the ick.

06:18.585 --> 06:19.655
[chuckles]

06:19.689 --> 06:21.967
Um, will you be alright
for a minute

06:22.002 --> 06:23.762
if I go and talk to me mates?

06:23.797 --> 06:26.972
Mm. Uh, I fancy a coffee.

06:27.007 --> 06:29.181
[indistinct chatter]

06:29.216 --> 06:30.804
...if you are not listening
to me.

06:30.838 --> 06:33.427
He didn't have a will.
The house is gonna ge--

06:33.462 --> 06:35.256
Wait.
We might need to wait, love.

06:35.291 --> 06:37.431
-Common decency.
-Me eye!

06:37.466 --> 06:40.020
If we wait, we run the risk
of all his little bastards

06:40.054 --> 06:41.504
coming out of the woodwork.

06:41.539 --> 06:44.887
That house is mine, Clive.
I'm having it.

06:45.888 --> 06:46.889
Oh.

06:49.547 --> 06:51.238
Was she there the whole time?

06:51.272 --> 06:53.758
Be careful
who you're talking around.

06:53.792 --> 06:55.691
The pathologist says
the cause of death

06:55.725 --> 06:58.003
was the initial blow
to the head.

06:58.038 --> 06:59.488
He died instantly, but his body

06:59.522 --> 07:01.559
would have bled a lot
when it was being cut up.

07:01.593 --> 07:03.699
No sign of a crime scene
at the gym or his home?

07:03.733 --> 07:08.048
Nothing. And the way he was
dismembered was professional.

07:08.082 --> 07:09.981
-No surgeons in the family?
-Huh.

07:10.015 --> 07:11.603
If only we were that lucky.

07:11.638 --> 07:13.191
We sent out a bulletin
for anyone who would've

07:13.225 --> 07:16.470
spotted the car
driving through the mountains.

07:16.505 --> 07:18.645
I mean, did they really think

07:18.679 --> 07:20.025
that we wouldn't find
the body parts?

07:20.060 --> 07:22.476
Like, why not dig a hole?

07:22.511 --> 07:26.238
[Charlie] Those bags he was
discarded in, anything on them?

07:27.550 --> 07:28.896
Super Cost, bought over

07:28.931 --> 07:31.209
by a leading chain
about five years ago.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.142
Where would somebody get a hold
of a load of those bags

07:33.176 --> 07:34.523
if the shop is out of operation?

07:34.557 --> 07:37.836
Mm, some people collect
plastic bags.

07:37.871 --> 07:40.494
My granny has a cupboard full.
She doesn't use any of them.

07:40.529 --> 07:44.015
-Because she has a good bag.
-Precisely.

07:44.049 --> 07:46.051
Is your gran our suspect, Jord?

07:48.675 --> 07:51.091
Well, she's 80

07:51.125 --> 07:54.646
and mouldy with gout,
so I doubt it.

07:54.681 --> 07:56.199
Let's just focus
on who might have had a grudge

07:56.234 --> 07:57.718
against Freddie.

07:57.753 --> 07:58.857
Yeah.

08:00.997 --> 08:02.033
[instrumental music]

08:02.067 --> 08:04.104
[indistinct chatter]

08:05.243 --> 08:06.313
What's this?

08:06.347 --> 08:09.558
[indistinct chatter]

08:13.665 --> 08:15.736
-On you go now. Off you go!
-Come on now!

08:15.771 --> 08:18.152
[Wendy] What do you think I am?
And I'm not moving anywhere.

08:18.187 --> 08:19.637
Me hole am I leaving!

08:19.671 --> 08:20.810
If you don't pack your things,

08:20.845 --> 08:22.536
then I'm gonna help you
move them out.

08:22.571 --> 08:24.883
You're the one
who should move out!

08:24.918 --> 08:28.646
Who the hell stays living
in their ex's house?

08:28.680 --> 08:30.371
Do you know what I mean?
Think about that, like.

08:30.406 --> 08:33.202
Hiya, um,
I'm sorry to disturb you,

08:33.236 --> 08:37.758
but, um, my nephew here
wanted to pay his respects.

08:37.793 --> 08:40.174
Oh, how kind!

08:41.106 --> 08:43.868
People have been so kind.

08:43.902 --> 08:45.801
-To me.
-Oh, here.

08:45.835 --> 08:48.666
[sobbing]

08:48.700 --> 08:51.876
[sighs] I'm so sorry,
this must be so hard for you.

08:51.910 --> 08:53.809
-It is.
-My condolences.

08:53.843 --> 08:54.810
Thank you.

08:59.677 --> 09:01.713
Ugly, isn't it?

09:01.748 --> 09:03.750
Jean's handiwork.

09:03.784 --> 09:05.717
I was waiting
until Freddie and I got married

09:05.752 --> 09:07.616
to redecorate it all.

09:07.650 --> 09:10.411
Yeah, I can see you'd wanna
put your own touch on it.

09:10.446 --> 09:13.414
It must be rough for all of you,
but I mean, at least, you know,

09:13.449 --> 09:15.934
you, uh, have each other.

09:15.969 --> 09:17.246
Living together, I, uh,

09:17.280 --> 09:19.904
I mean, I imagine
it must be supportive.

09:20.767 --> 09:22.078
Do you?

09:22.907 --> 09:24.253
You must excuse me.

09:24.287 --> 09:26.220
I need to fix me face.

09:26.255 --> 09:29.154
It's exhausting,
dealing with all of this.

09:29.189 --> 09:31.709
[sobbing]

09:32.986 --> 09:34.263
[sighs]

09:38.405 --> 09:42.271
The official version is
we were all one big happy family

09:42.305 --> 09:44.929
because Freddie loved family.

09:44.963 --> 09:46.896
The unofficial version?

09:46.931 --> 09:48.139
Freddie loved family, alright,

09:48.173 --> 09:50.313
but he was also terrible
with money.

09:50.348 --> 09:52.039
He was meant to buy Jean
out of this house

09:52.074 --> 09:54.628
when they got divorced,
but he didn't.

09:54.663 --> 09:57.700
Instead, he gave her
part of the gym.

09:57.735 --> 09:59.978
And you had to live
with his ex-wife.

10:00.013 --> 10:02.222
Mm-hmm. And Clive.

10:02.256 --> 10:06.295
The most exciting man
on the planet.

10:06.329 --> 10:09.229
Uh, my nephew will be back
in a second.

10:09.263 --> 10:10.886
He has a very weak bladder.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.922
[chuckles]
No problem.

10:15.097 --> 10:17.133
He-he was very keen to come.

10:17.927 --> 10:19.342
Sure.

10:19.377 --> 10:23.174
But then you must know that
more than anybody.

10:23.208 --> 10:25.797
I mean,
most men would not consider

10:25.832 --> 10:27.765
living with their wife's ex.

10:27.799 --> 10:29.111
[chuckles]

10:30.215 --> 10:32.045
You must have got along.

10:32.079 --> 10:34.461
Oh, we did, we did.

10:34.495 --> 10:37.498
-Huh.
-Hello, Mr. Clive.

10:37.533 --> 10:40.225
Freddie had asked me
to hang a bag for Steve.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.711
Get more practice in.

10:42.745 --> 10:44.747
Anymore jobs for me?

10:44.782 --> 10:46.784
No. Thank you, Paddy.

10:50.270 --> 10:52.997
Are you okay?
How are you getting on?

10:53.031 --> 10:56.103
Ah, just keeping busy,
Mr. Clive.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.763
Are you sure
I can't do something?

11:00.798 --> 11:02.869
We're fine. How are you?

11:02.903 --> 11:05.837
Are you getting on okay?
How is it going at the caravan?

11:05.872 --> 11:09.772
Did you get that roof fixed yet?
Have you got somewhere to stay?

11:11.740 --> 11:13.120
You miss Freddie?

11:13.155 --> 11:15.709
Yeah. I do.

11:15.744 --> 11:19.506
And I don't even really know
why. He was driving me nuts.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.370
He kept promising
to straighten stuff out,

11:21.404 --> 11:25.408
but these last few months,
I don't know,

11:25.443 --> 11:27.238
he was keeping something
from me.

11:27.272 --> 11:31.104
Whether it was money troubles
or another woman,

11:31.138 --> 11:33.175
I don't know.

11:33.209 --> 11:34.210
[glass thuds]

11:34.245 --> 11:35.418
If he wasn't already dead, I'd

11:35.453 --> 11:37.766
bloody kill him
for doing this to me.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.215
[instrumental music]

11:39.250 --> 11:41.217
So it was certainly
no fairy-tale.

11:41.252 --> 11:45.394
Mm. Well, the cracks
are certainly starting to show.

11:45.428 --> 11:48.052
[Harry] We need to learn more
about that man.

11:48.086 --> 11:50.744
If he wasn't here,
he was in that gym.

11:50.779 --> 11:53.057
Yeah, where I can go, but if you
keep hanging around there,

11:53.091 --> 11:55.404
someone's gonna fit you for a
pair of gloves and a mouthguard.

11:55.438 --> 11:59.097
[chuckles]
Boxing, with this face?

11:59.132 --> 12:02.100
No. I have a much better idea.

12:03.205 --> 12:04.793
[instrumental music]

12:04.827 --> 12:06.553
[intense music]

12:06.587 --> 12:09.521
[grunting]

12:12.559 --> 12:14.941
[thudding]

12:15.873 --> 12:16.839
Oh!

12:17.598 --> 12:20.567
[grunting]

12:27.608 --> 12:30.542
[panting]

12:34.823 --> 12:37.929
Footwork! Footwork!
Come on, move the feet.

12:37.964 --> 12:40.173
You look like
you have lead in those boots.

12:41.864 --> 12:43.314
That's it.

12:45.074 --> 12:47.007
[groans]

12:47.042 --> 12:49.423
Jesus! Will you keep it tight?

12:49.458 --> 12:52.426
Danny Kelly will lay you out
in round one at this rate.

12:53.634 --> 12:56.154
I'm sorry, Steve. Sorry.

12:58.225 --> 12:59.986
[panting]

13:00.020 --> 13:02.264
Enough. Enough.

13:03.023 --> 13:04.266
Enough.

13:06.026 --> 13:07.821
[sniffles]
Ah.

13:11.860 --> 13:13.620
[exhales sharply]

13:13.654 --> 13:15.518
He's in bits.

13:15.553 --> 13:18.452
Thinks he should have protected
his brother.

13:18.487 --> 13:22.318
Um, what's the infinity symbol
on his gloves all about?

13:22.353 --> 13:23.664
Steve's mark.

13:23.699 --> 13:27.013
Infinity,
'cause he keeps on going.

13:27.047 --> 13:30.395
[scoffs]
Or at least he used to, anyway.

13:30.430 --> 13:33.433
I'm worried about this fight
now, Fergus.

13:33.467 --> 13:35.435
He's liable to freeze
or anything.

13:35.469 --> 13:36.850
Could you postpone it maybe?

13:36.885 --> 13:38.403
I mean, at least
until he's coping a bit better

13:38.438 --> 13:40.095
with Freddie's death?

13:40.129 --> 13:41.234
See, Danny Kelly knows that

13:41.268 --> 13:42.683
Steve's gonna be weaker
right now.

13:42.718 --> 13:44.996
So if we delay it,
he'll just call it a forfeit.

13:45.031 --> 13:46.929
[door opens]

13:46.964 --> 13:49.069
What are you gonna do?

13:49.104 --> 13:51.175
I'm gonna rely
on our new saviour.

13:51.209 --> 13:53.625
A sports psychologist.

13:55.248 --> 13:56.905
-Harry?
-You should have told me...

13:56.939 --> 13:58.492
What your aunt did, Fergus.

13:58.527 --> 13:59.666
I've been looking for someone
to come in

13:59.700 --> 14:01.150
and gee-up the fighters.

14:01.185 --> 14:03.256
Thanks so much for offering to
do this, Dr. Wild.

14:03.290 --> 14:04.913
My pleasure.

14:04.947 --> 14:07.329
[chuckles]

14:07.363 --> 14:09.434
What the hell are you doing?

14:09.469 --> 14:12.127
Stroke of genius, isn't it?

14:12.161 --> 14:14.336
I figured that this would be
the best way

14:14.370 --> 14:17.477
to have one-on-ones with people
that knew Freddie best.

14:17.511 --> 14:19.237
You don't know anything
about boxing.

14:19.272 --> 14:21.930
-Or any sport, for that matter.
-Oh. Pfft.

14:21.964 --> 14:25.968
Hemingway boxed, and Sartre.
All of the literary greats did.

14:26.003 --> 14:28.384
And I know my literary greats.

14:28.419 --> 14:30.283
This is nice, isn't it?

14:30.317 --> 14:32.216
I'm sorry we couldn't go
to the playground,

14:32.250 --> 14:34.597
but it's so cold!

14:34.632 --> 14:36.634
It's always cold here.

14:36.668 --> 14:40.672
Ugh. Where I live,
it's always warm.

14:40.707 --> 14:45.056
[chuckles] And they even have
a playground on the beach.

14:45.091 --> 14:46.989
-On the beach?
-Yes.

14:47.024 --> 14:50.234
You see the kids,
they run in, they have a swim,

14:50.268 --> 14:51.994
and then they just come back
and play.

14:52.029 --> 14:53.685
-Sounds like magic.
-It is!

14:53.720 --> 14:55.756
Would you like to see it
sometime?

14:55.791 --> 14:58.518
-Can I?
-Of course, you can.

14:58.552 --> 15:00.382
And Fergus can come as well.

15:00.416 --> 15:03.488
-He thinks he's a detective.
-Really?

15:03.523 --> 15:06.146
[grunting]

15:06.181 --> 15:07.734
Freddie was the best.

15:07.768 --> 15:11.945
[grunting]
A great man, great coach.

15:12.739 --> 15:14.948
Freddie, he was amazing.

15:14.983 --> 15:16.605
So supportive.

15:16.639 --> 15:20.057
He used to say nothing else
mattered other than

15:20.091 --> 15:23.750
getting under those ropes
and standing on the canvass.

15:23.784 --> 15:28.582
Every fight, sixth round,
down I go.

15:28.617 --> 15:30.136
What do you think
I should do, doc?

15:30.170 --> 15:33.484
A man can be destroyed,
but not defeated.

15:33.518 --> 15:35.589
Hemingway's not gonna help.

15:35.624 --> 15:39.179
Oh. I'm impressed.

15:39.214 --> 15:42.251
Okay. Oh, we'll try
something different.

15:42.286 --> 15:44.426
Well, why don't you
lie down for me?

15:44.460 --> 15:47.774
-Mm.
-Trust the process.

15:47.808 --> 15:50.535
Courage is grace under pressure.

15:52.054 --> 15:53.504
Hemingway.

15:53.538 --> 15:55.713
Read him for the next fight.

15:56.679 --> 15:58.198
Okay.

15:58.233 --> 16:01.305
[thudding]

16:02.823 --> 16:05.240
So it's, uh, six.

16:05.274 --> 16:08.070
It's, um, something about six.

16:08.105 --> 16:10.003
Are you one of six kids?

16:10.038 --> 16:12.350
-Only child.
-Huh.

16:12.385 --> 16:13.489
Uh, what about
when you were six?

16:13.524 --> 16:15.215
Do you remember anything,

16:15.250 --> 16:16.734
anything happening at that age?

16:16.768 --> 16:19.840
Did you get lost
in a supermarket or something?

16:19.875 --> 16:21.773
-No.
-Bullied at school?

16:21.808 --> 16:23.568
Nobody picked on me.

16:24.638 --> 16:26.468
Ah... Huh.

16:31.645 --> 16:33.233
What is it?

16:33.268 --> 16:35.408
I remember me birthday party.

16:35.442 --> 16:38.790
[Conor]My sixth birthday.
Nobody came.

16:40.068 --> 16:41.517
God. Nobody came.

16:41.552 --> 16:43.105
I used to beat up
some of the kids at school,

16:43.140 --> 16:46.798
so I guess that's why
none of them came to me party.

16:46.833 --> 16:49.456
What is it Sartre said?

16:49.491 --> 16:51.734
"Hell is other people."

16:54.151 --> 16:56.705
Are you a kind person now?

16:56.739 --> 16:58.534
Could be kinder, I suppose.

16:58.569 --> 17:02.090
Do that, and, uh, see how
you feel in your next round six.

17:02.124 --> 17:04.368
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

17:04.885 --> 17:06.197
[sighs]

17:06.853 --> 17:08.648
You're bloody mental.

17:08.682 --> 17:11.858
I think the word you're looking
for is skilled psychologist.

17:11.892 --> 17:15.448
I'm actually quite enjoying it,
but it's getting us nowhere.

17:15.482 --> 17:18.278
And everybody likes Freddie.

17:18.313 --> 17:20.384
I'm starting to like Freddie.

17:20.418 --> 17:22.144
Well, I did tell you.

17:27.494 --> 17:30.497
I think I'll take this next one
on my own.

17:33.707 --> 17:36.814
Right, I don't need
any head-shrinking, doc.

17:36.848 --> 17:39.368
I know what I need to do
when I get in the ring

17:39.403 --> 17:42.371
and I'll do it, for Freddie.

17:42.406 --> 17:44.304
For Freddie? Not you?

17:44.339 --> 17:49.171
I never wanted to box again
after being away.

17:49.206 --> 17:53.279
You were in the army, right?
That can be very traumatic.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.454
There was one incident.

17:56.489 --> 17:57.490
Lebanon.

17:59.216 --> 18:02.771
This kid,
one of my new recruits,

18:02.805 --> 18:04.600
stepped on a mine.

18:05.325 --> 18:06.637
That was it.

18:06.671 --> 18:09.364
I brought his belongings home
to his mother.

18:09.398 --> 18:12.125
Jesus Christ. I can't imagine
what that felt like.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.437
[Steve exhales sharply]

18:13.471 --> 18:14.748
Can't be easy now without him.

18:14.783 --> 18:17.337
I've been to your house.

18:17.372 --> 18:18.821
Living with all that tension.

18:18.856 --> 18:19.960
Oh, it-it was all fine when

18:19.995 --> 18:21.962
Freddie was alive, you know?

18:21.997 --> 18:25.656
He could make anywhere fun,
you know?

18:25.690 --> 18:30.385
I guess it was the shock
of him dying, it upset things.

18:31.006 --> 18:32.766
Mm.

18:32.801 --> 18:36.667
Jean and Wendy,
they seem to be over it now.

18:37.495 --> 18:39.428
Oh, I see.

18:39.463 --> 18:41.499
I don't care
what the rumours are, Johnny.

18:41.534 --> 18:43.432
There is nothing dodgy
in my gym.

18:43.467 --> 18:44.813
The Scatt-Kelly fight goes ahead

18:44.847 --> 18:47.954
or we'll call it a forfeit
and claim the win.

18:47.988 --> 18:49.300
[thudding]

18:49.335 --> 18:50.474
[Conor]What the...

18:52.027 --> 18:53.994
Here, son.
I shouldn't have left it there.

18:54.029 --> 18:56.480
-You're grand, Paddy.
-Very sorry.

18:56.514 --> 18:58.654
Yeah, it's okay, Paddy.
Just go get some towels.

18:58.689 --> 19:00.553
Uh-huh. Yeah.

19:00.587 --> 19:01.761
-You okay?
-Yeah, all good. Here.

19:01.795 --> 19:03.487
-No, I'll get that.
-Ah, no, you're alright.

19:03.521 --> 19:05.178
Sound, yeah. I'm soaked, man.

19:05.213 --> 19:07.491
[laughs]

19:07.525 --> 19:09.493
Thanks, Fergus.
You don't have to.

19:09.527 --> 19:12.772
Ah, it's no bother.
You're very good to him.

19:12.806 --> 19:16.224
[sighs] Ah, he's okay.
A bit hard to talk to sometimes.

19:16.258 --> 19:18.433
And let's face it,
not the greatest cleaner.

19:18.467 --> 19:21.229
Why did you keep him on?

19:21.263 --> 19:23.438
He works practically for free.

19:23.472 --> 19:27.200
But, mainly,
Freddie felt guilty.

19:27.235 --> 19:29.306
See, Freddie used to box,

19:29.340 --> 19:31.308
and he landed the blow that...

19:32.585 --> 19:36.520
Well, I don't think
Paddy was always as slow.

19:36.554 --> 19:38.798
Weird thing is, now he can take
any amount of blows

19:38.832 --> 19:41.697
and he'll stay standing.

19:41.732 --> 19:43.458
[footsteps approaching]

19:43.492 --> 19:45.943
-You got what I asked for?
-Yeah.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.979
[man grunting]

19:48.014 --> 19:51.259
[ominous music]

19:54.020 --> 19:57.265
I think I'm ready to coach
the national boxing team.

19:57.299 --> 19:59.853
[laughs] I just quoted
Joyce Carol Oates

19:59.888 --> 20:03.443
to a chap that keeps dreaming
that he's naked in the ring.

20:03.478 --> 20:07.482
Boxing is the celebration of
a lost religion of masculinity.

20:07.516 --> 20:09.553
[chuckles]
He was tickled.

20:10.726 --> 20:13.246
Wha-what's going on?

20:13.729 --> 20:15.041
No idea.

20:19.701 --> 20:22.566
[man grunting]

20:24.947 --> 20:26.294
Oh, Jesus!

20:26.328 --> 20:28.468
[printer whirring]

20:30.125 --> 20:31.954
So I found out something
that might be of use.

20:31.989 --> 20:33.301
Yeah, go on.

20:33.335 --> 20:36.476
Fergus Reid is a member
of Freddie's gym.

20:37.857 --> 20:39.099
You're kidding me?

20:39.134 --> 20:41.688
I kid you not.

20:41.723 --> 20:44.553
Jordan, how is that
of any use to us?

20:44.588 --> 20:45.451
Oh.

20:45.485 --> 20:46.452
All it means is that

20:46.486 --> 20:47.660
Harry bloody Wild is

20:47.694 --> 20:49.834
already gonna be
all over this case.

20:49.869 --> 20:52.320
And if they solve another one
before us, I mean...

20:52.354 --> 20:54.114
Oh. There was one other thing.

20:54.149 --> 20:57.325
Freddie's wife and fiancee,
they've organised a meeting

20:57.359 --> 20:58.567
with the manager
of the Credit Union

20:58.602 --> 21:00.431
where Freddie had his account.

21:00.466 --> 21:01.501
-What, together?
-Yup.

21:01.536 --> 21:03.745
It feels
a bit weird seeing as, you know,

21:03.779 --> 21:05.436
it felt like
they couldn't stand one another

21:05.471 --> 21:07.507
when we interviewed them.

21:07.542 --> 21:10.476
Talk about burying the lead,
Jords!

21:10.510 --> 21:14.445
Maybe they're in it together.

21:14.480 --> 21:18.035
[scoffs] The fraught living
arrangement is just an act.

21:19.726 --> 21:21.763
They killed him,

21:21.797 --> 21:24.835
and now
they're splitting his money.

21:24.869 --> 21:27.493
-Ah...
-Oh.

21:27.527 --> 21:28.873
Yes.

21:28.908 --> 21:31.428
[suspenseful music]

21:32.187 --> 21:34.362
[indistinct chatter]

21:34.396 --> 21:35.984
[Wendy laughing]

21:36.018 --> 21:37.641
[indistinct chatter]

21:37.675 --> 21:39.367
[laughing]

21:40.022 --> 21:41.748
[indistinct chatter]

21:45.856 --> 21:46.857
[laughing]

21:58.109 --> 22:00.698
[laughing]

22:00.733 --> 22:02.942
[indistinct chatter]

22:02.976 --> 22:05.393
And then me and you
are going to Kusadasi. Ha-ha...

22:05.427 --> 22:08.188
I must say,
the ex-wife and the fiancee

22:08.223 --> 22:11.053
sharing
a celebratory bottle of wine.

22:11.916 --> 22:13.124
[scoffs]

22:14.885 --> 22:18.923
When those two police officers
following you catch up with us,

22:18.958 --> 22:21.650
they're gonna find this
very suspicious, I imagine.

22:21.685 --> 22:23.997
Police? What police?

22:24.032 --> 22:27.656
Sorry, but who actually are you?

22:27.691 --> 22:32.074
She's the aunt of one of those
lads down at the gym, isn't she?

22:32.109 --> 22:35.077
Mm, I'm a bit more than that.

22:35.112 --> 22:36.769
-You're a private detective.
-Oh!

22:36.803 --> 22:39.047
Wait. I've seen you.
You were in the papers.

22:39.081 --> 22:41.808
-Well done.
-Who hired you?

22:41.843 --> 22:44.673
Who hired me is irrelevant.

22:44.708 --> 22:48.574
What matters is that having
learned a bit about Freddie,

22:48.608 --> 22:52.232
now, I,
I want to find his killer,

22:52.267 --> 22:54.096
his actual killer,

22:54.131 --> 22:56.720
because those two cops,

22:56.754 --> 23:00.758
they'll settle for
the, uh, most likely candidate.

23:00.793 --> 23:02.657
Or candidates.

23:03.968 --> 23:06.005
[music continues]

23:06.039 --> 23:08.179
We're not your suspects.

23:08.214 --> 23:11.700
We're just two women
coming to terms with reality.

23:12.805 --> 23:14.116
Intriguing.

23:15.497 --> 23:17.775
I gave Freddie
a very large loan.

23:17.810 --> 23:20.813
He promised to repay it
from the gym's profits.

23:20.847 --> 23:24.126
Turns out,
the gym is in massive debt.

23:24.161 --> 23:28.476
Shit businessman
and shit fiance.

23:28.510 --> 23:30.685
He was screwing
another woman, too.

23:30.719 --> 23:31.686
Who?

23:35.137 --> 23:37.139
Mm, well,
when I looked at the accounts,

23:37.174 --> 23:42.006
I noticed that Becca now owns
a sizeable share of the gym.

23:42.041 --> 23:44.250
Which came as a surprise to me.

23:44.284 --> 23:46.148
And Becca won't agree
to sell the gym,

23:46.183 --> 23:50.532
so I have to sell the house
to give Wendy what she's owed.

23:50.567 --> 23:54.087
So the ex and the fiancee
are coming together.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.676
-For Freddie!
-For Freddie!

23:56.711 --> 23:59.645
[laughing]

24:00.922 --> 24:03.131
Love it.

24:03.165 --> 24:05.789
Jab. Push off that back foot.

24:05.823 --> 24:07.791
There you go. Jab back hand.

24:07.825 --> 24:08.792
[sighs]

24:08.826 --> 24:10.725
Don't overthink it. Just do it.

24:10.759 --> 24:13.521
That's what Freddie always said.
Let your fist do the thinking.

24:13.555 --> 24:17.076
Thinking? These limp noodles,
they can barely do the punching.

24:19.872 --> 24:22.012
[sighs]
You really miss him?

24:22.046 --> 24:24.290
More than I thought possible.

24:24.324 --> 24:26.016
Sorry, kid.
But we need to concentrate.

24:26.050 --> 24:27.811
I have to concentrate. Hoo!

24:28.708 --> 24:30.089
Ah...

24:30.123 --> 24:31.987
[exhaling sharply]

24:32.022 --> 24:34.300
[sighs]
Um, Becca,

24:34.334 --> 24:36.198
I actually need to talk to you
about something.

24:36.233 --> 24:38.338
-Yeah?
-It's kind of awkward.

24:38.373 --> 24:42.170
But I don't have my money
for this week's training.

24:42.204 --> 24:44.793
It's alright.
Don't worry about it.

24:44.828 --> 24:46.519
Freddie always let lads
carry over their fees

24:46.554 --> 24:49.280
if they didn't have it,
and I wanna keep that going.

24:49.315 --> 24:52.283
Um, for as long as I can anyway.

24:52.318 --> 24:54.285
Though I have a suggestion,
actually.

24:54.320 --> 24:58.048
[panting]
I was, um, I was thinking,

24:58.082 --> 24:59.843
what if I could do
a bit of work?

24:59.877 --> 25:02.224
You know,
Paddy could use the help and...

25:02.259 --> 25:05.055
Why not? You can't be any worse
than Paddy.

25:05.089 --> 25:06.712
[laughs]

25:09.197 --> 25:10.716
[sweeping]

25:12.234 --> 25:16.515
So, I'll help you give the place
a sweep then, will I?

25:18.862 --> 25:20.553
Spit buckets.

25:21.278 --> 25:22.969
Clean them.

25:23.004 --> 25:25.075
Then do the toilets.

25:25.938 --> 25:27.560
You're the boss.

25:29.148 --> 25:31.391
[Paddy]There's bleach
out the back.

25:31.426 --> 25:32.841
[sighs]

25:48.167 --> 25:51.032
Becca only lets me
clean the office.

25:51.066 --> 25:52.343
Cool.

25:53.621 --> 25:56.313
I will go
and get some supplies.

25:57.107 --> 25:58.867
[bucket thuds]

25:58.902 --> 26:01.870
[ominous music]

26:08.912 --> 26:10.258
[door opens]

26:13.123 --> 26:15.850
Bleach. Bleach.

26:16.713 --> 26:18.162
There you are.

26:20.475 --> 26:22.201
Ah.

26:22.235 --> 26:24.065
That is the one.

26:25.204 --> 26:28.276
[music continues]

26:34.903 --> 26:36.871
You live here, don't you, fella?

26:38.079 --> 26:39.045
[sighs]

26:39.080 --> 26:41.082
Oh, shit!

26:45.914 --> 26:48.158
[panting]

26:54.060 --> 26:55.372
[gasps]

26:58.099 --> 26:59.134
[eerie music]

26:59.169 --> 27:01.067
Oh, shit!

27:05.175 --> 27:08.247
[intense music]

27:14.253 --> 27:17.325
[doorknob rattling]

27:19.845 --> 27:23.814
[Paddy]Where are you, Fergus?
I know you're here.

27:28.750 --> 27:30.096
[cell phone chimes]

27:31.063 --> 27:32.374
Oh, Fergus.

27:32.409 --> 27:35.308
This came in
from a member of the public.

27:35.343 --> 27:36.965
A reg of the car
spotted driving erratically

27:37.000 --> 27:40.797
through the mountains when
your vic was being discarded.

27:40.831 --> 27:43.109
[laptop keys clacking]

27:45.318 --> 27:46.423
Paddy Duffin.

27:46.457 --> 27:47.700
[Charlie]Get him in.

27:50.151 --> 27:52.049
You know me secret, don't you?

27:52.084 --> 27:53.430
[rattling]

27:55.812 --> 27:57.745
Come out, Fergus.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.267
Don't be scared.

28:04.924 --> 28:06.823
Come out, kid.

28:06.857 --> 28:08.790
I only wanna talk to ya.

28:12.414 --> 28:13.933
Paddy...

28:13.968 --> 28:16.902
I-I, I need your help.

28:16.936 --> 28:18.938
It's, it's my left hook.

28:18.973 --> 28:20.526
[thudding]

28:20.560 --> 28:22.390
I can't land anything with it.

28:23.598 --> 28:28.120
So, what did you wanna
talk to me about?

28:28.154 --> 28:30.329
I shouldn't have let you
get that bleach.

28:32.918 --> 28:35.506
Nobody's supposed to know
that I'm living here.

28:37.129 --> 28:38.958
[Fergus panting]

28:38.993 --> 28:41.167
Freddie said I wasn't allowed.

28:41.202 --> 28:44.274
[eerie music]

28:47.518 --> 28:48.761
[car door shuts]

28:56.907 --> 28:57.908
[knocking on door]

28:58.564 --> 28:59.738
[grunts]

29:00.911 --> 29:03.224
-Harry!
-Oh!

29:03.258 --> 29:05.536
Oh, thank Christ for that.

29:06.434 --> 29:07.435
Oh.

29:09.886 --> 29:12.267
How long have you been
living here, Paddy?

29:12.302 --> 29:14.580
-A, a few weeks.
-Oh.

29:14.614 --> 29:17.134
I needed somewhere to stay
while I was fixing my place.

29:17.169 --> 29:18.480
Mm.

29:19.205 --> 29:21.414
Yes, um...

29:21.449 --> 29:25.902
Well, the, the bags
that Fergus found,

29:25.936 --> 29:27.973
why do you have
so many of them?

29:28.007 --> 29:32.115
Oh. When I finished fighting,
I got a job at Super Cost.

29:32.149 --> 29:33.219
Oh.

29:33.254 --> 29:34.220
They moved me around from

29:34.255 --> 29:36.844
section to section.

29:36.878 --> 29:38.052
The only place I was any good

29:38.086 --> 29:40.399
was the butcher's and bagging.

29:40.433 --> 29:41.572
[sighs]

29:41.607 --> 29:45.300
Um, I took the bags
when it was closing.

29:45.335 --> 29:48.510
I figured they'd be good
for rubbish and stuff.

29:50.098 --> 29:51.582
Well, the police
are going to want to know

29:51.617 --> 29:52.998
who borrowed those bags.

29:53.032 --> 29:56.829
You see, um, they were used

29:56.864 --> 29:59.073
to put bits of Freddie in
after he'd been killed.

29:59.107 --> 30:01.800
So somebody here
must have taken a few.

30:02.628 --> 30:03.871
Ah, no.

30:05.286 --> 30:07.598
Um, that was my idea.

30:07.633 --> 30:09.669
What was that now, pal?

30:09.704 --> 30:13.018
It was my idea to chop him up
and put him in the bags.

30:13.052 --> 30:16.435
Yeah, but I didn't think
anyone would find him, you see?

30:16.469 --> 30:19.956
No, I didn't want anyone
to get into trouble.

30:19.990 --> 30:22.544
Well, I got rid of all of him,

30:22.579 --> 30:25.306
but I couldn't get rid
of the weight.

30:25.340 --> 30:28.274
Mm, it was too heavy
to throw out the window.

30:28.309 --> 30:31.553
You know,
it would have broken the bag.

30:31.588 --> 30:36.006
Paddy, are you telling me
you killed Freddie?

30:36.041 --> 30:37.697
I didn't kill him.

30:37.732 --> 30:40.908
I only helped clean up. Huh.

30:42.185 --> 30:45.636
Oh, maybe I shouldn't say
any more.

30:45.671 --> 30:48.985
I don't wanna get anybody
into trouble, you know?

30:49.019 --> 30:52.126
[eerie music]

30:58.235 --> 31:00.203
[indistinct radio chatter]

31:04.241 --> 31:06.623
[indistinct radio chatter]

31:07.313 --> 31:08.487
You two alright?

31:08.521 --> 31:09.626
Yes. Sorry.

31:09.660 --> 31:12.560
I know I'm supposed to
call Vicky now.

31:12.594 --> 31:16.391
But I was worried about Fergus
and I didn't think.

31:16.426 --> 31:18.497
You can call me anytime,
mother.

31:18.531 --> 31:22.121
And now we have our killer.

31:22.156 --> 31:25.400
No, I don't think you do.
He said he just cleaned up.

31:25.435 --> 31:28.610
Ah, he's just covering his arse.
We'll get the truth out of him.

31:28.645 --> 31:31.682
How was he killed
before he was dismembered?

31:32.718 --> 31:33.753
Blow to the head.

31:33.788 --> 31:35.479
But it could've
been someone else.

31:35.514 --> 31:39.276
Mother, you've done enough.
Let it go.

31:41.658 --> 31:43.177
[tapping]

31:44.178 --> 31:47.284
[engine revving]

31:48.009 --> 31:48.976
[sighs]

31:51.461 --> 31:54.774
Dad! You will not believe
the night I've had.

31:54.809 --> 31:56.776
[panting]

31:56.811 --> 31:58.295
Alright, ma?

31:59.607 --> 32:01.195
[chuckles]

32:02.058 --> 32:03.473
What is it?

32:05.164 --> 32:06.614
What's going on?

32:08.202 --> 32:10.135
Are you leaving again?

32:13.103 --> 32:16.106
Go on, tell him.

32:16.831 --> 32:18.660
Tell me what?

32:18.695 --> 32:21.698
I want Liberty to come
live with me in the States.

32:23.769 --> 32:26.151
I've applied for her passport.

32:28.291 --> 32:30.293
I'd like your permission, but...

32:32.122 --> 32:33.641
I'll go for custody.

32:35.539 --> 32:38.439
A girl needs her mother, Fergus.

32:38.473 --> 32:39.716
Don't.

32:42.098 --> 32:43.754
Don't speak to me.

32:46.274 --> 32:48.276
[instrumental music]

32:48.311 --> 32:51.486
[Paula]We need to discuss this

32:51.521 --> 32:53.764
like adults.

32:53.799 --> 32:56.595
[sobbing]

32:56.629 --> 32:59.529
I bought Fergus the house.
You'll both be fine!

32:59.563 --> 33:01.186
Get out.

33:01.772 --> 33:03.567
Get out!

33:05.776 --> 33:07.261
[sobbing]

33:07.295 --> 33:09.228
[door opens]

33:09.263 --> 33:10.712
[door shuts]

33:10.747 --> 33:12.611
[Fergus sobbing]

33:12.645 --> 33:15.614
[music continues]

33:29.869 --> 33:32.562
Oh, Fergus.

33:32.596 --> 33:34.598
What can I do?

33:34.633 --> 33:37.705
Don't know, Harry. Don't know
what any of us can do.

33:37.739 --> 33:41.536
You wanna stay home
with Liberty?

33:41.571 --> 33:43.883
Nah. She's in her friend's.

33:43.918 --> 33:46.093
I need to keep busy, you know?

33:46.127 --> 33:48.267
It's Malky. He's...

33:49.682 --> 33:51.167
He's not good.

33:53.721 --> 33:56.172
Okay. Let's go.

33:59.520 --> 34:02.488
[engine revving]

34:05.526 --> 34:07.286
[thudding]

34:07.321 --> 34:09.495
[Becca] Look, I don't really
have time for this.

34:09.530 --> 34:12.533
Big fight is in an hour,
and to learn what Paddy did

34:12.567 --> 34:15.260
on top of everything, Jesus!

34:15.294 --> 34:18.090
The thing is, Becca, Paddy said
he didn't kill Freddie,

34:18.125 --> 34:20.265
that he just got rid
of his body.

34:20.299 --> 34:24.096
And we think that
he would only do that

34:24.131 --> 34:26.581
for somebody
that he wanted to protect.

34:29.481 --> 34:31.759
He was fond of you.

34:31.793 --> 34:34.451
-Did he want to protect you?
-What?

34:34.486 --> 34:36.522
Look, were you having an affair
with Freddie, Becca?

34:36.557 --> 34:39.215
Because his fiancee
certainly thinks you were.

34:39.249 --> 34:40.837
An affair?

34:42.666 --> 34:44.220
Affair.

34:51.158 --> 34:53.781
I loved him,

34:53.815 --> 34:55.783
but I wasn't his mistress.

34:57.371 --> 35:00.684
Well, at the memorial,
Jean said something

35:00.719 --> 35:04.792
about Freddie's bastards
coming out of the woodwork.

35:04.826 --> 35:07.415
-You're--
-His daughter.

35:09.210 --> 35:12.972
His secret, bastard daughter.

35:13.007 --> 35:14.836
But he didn't want anyone
to know.

35:14.871 --> 35:18.875
He got my mother pregnant
soon after he married Jean.

35:18.909 --> 35:22.189
Oh, he tried to make it up,
giving me part of the gym.

35:22.223 --> 35:24.674
[chuckles]
A gym so deep in debt...

35:24.708 --> 35:29.472
God, if he was here now,
I'd have a few words for him.

35:29.506 --> 35:34.235
But, look, instead, I have to
try and get this fight staged.

35:34.270 --> 35:35.719
And at the moment, I don't know

35:35.754 --> 35:37.583
if Danny Kelly
is even gonna show up.

35:37.618 --> 35:41.173
Why? What would Danny have
against this club?

35:43.313 --> 35:46.385
His manager, Johnny, said that,

35:46.420 --> 35:48.215
he said that
Freddie was so broke,

35:48.249 --> 35:50.769
he organised dodgy fights.

35:50.803 --> 35:53.565
Apparently, Johnny and Danny
heard rumour of a book that said

35:53.599 --> 35:55.981
Steve was going down
in the fourth round.

35:56.015 --> 35:59.226
So what, they're accusing you
of trying to fix the fight?

35:59.260 --> 36:01.642
They're accusing Freddie.

36:01.676 --> 36:04.438
[dramatic music]

36:05.508 --> 36:07.648
Okay, warm up. Nice and easy.

36:09.995 --> 36:13.309
[Harry] Fergus, I have an idea.
But I need to check on it.

36:13.343 --> 36:14.931
The police still don't know

36:14.965 --> 36:17.623
where Freddie's body
was chopped up.

36:17.658 --> 36:19.522
Okay. But what does that
have to do with anything?

36:19.556 --> 36:21.558
I mean, we know
Paddy chopped him up.

36:21.593 --> 36:24.630
But we also know he didn't get
rid of some of the evidence.

36:24.665 --> 36:26.667
He said there was a weight,
it was too heavy.

36:26.701 --> 36:28.289
Do you remember?

36:28.324 --> 36:30.636
Well, what if that was used
to kill him?

36:30.671 --> 36:33.984
Maybe the, the DNA of the killer
will be on that weight.

36:34.019 --> 36:36.021
And where do you think it is?

36:36.055 --> 36:37.229
[door opens]

36:37.264 --> 36:38.299
[footsteps approaching]

36:38.334 --> 36:39.542
[door shuts]

36:43.408 --> 36:46.514
Shocking news, isn't it?
About Paddy.

36:47.722 --> 36:49.310
Unbelievable.

36:49.345 --> 36:51.692
And he's been in our home.

36:51.726 --> 36:54.971
[Jean]We were always so kind
to him. Freddie, especially.

36:55.005 --> 36:57.422
[Harry]Hm. And your Clive.

36:57.456 --> 37:01.840
He was talking to Paddy about
his caravan when I last saw him.

37:01.874 --> 37:04.636
Checking up to see
if he'd got that roof fixed.

37:04.670 --> 37:08.881
I know. Imagine living in
a caravan in this day and age.

37:08.916 --> 37:13.058
I told Clive, "You shouldn't be
letting him stay on your land."

37:13.092 --> 37:14.577
-His land?
-Yeah.

37:14.611 --> 37:17.649
Clive owns the field
where Paddy lives.

37:17.683 --> 37:19.409
Or lived.

37:19.444 --> 37:22.792
I presume
he'll be residing in jail now.

37:22.826 --> 37:25.760
[ominous music]

37:33.630 --> 37:35.356
[doors opening]

37:37.082 --> 37:38.842
[doors shutting]

37:38.877 --> 37:40.430
Shall we call the police, Harry?

37:40.465 --> 37:42.294
We don't wanna contaminate
a crime scene.

37:42.329 --> 37:44.020
We're just taking a look.

37:46.919 --> 37:48.335
[door opens]

37:52.028 --> 37:54.513
-Ugh!
-Ugh!

37:56.170 --> 37:58.862
Ugh! Ah...

37:58.897 --> 38:01.348
Jesus H Christ!

38:01.382 --> 38:04.005
[Fergus panting]

38:04.040 --> 38:06.422
Fergus, look, the weight.

38:08.907 --> 38:10.805
-Go.
-Ugh!

38:10.840 --> 38:12.704
-Oh.
-Oh.

38:13.946 --> 38:17.018
[crowd cheering]

38:21.782 --> 38:22.748
[bell rings]

38:22.783 --> 38:23.922
Yeah!

38:23.956 --> 38:26.476
[crowd cheering]

38:27.581 --> 38:30.169
-Come on, Steve!
-Get in! Yes!

38:30.204 --> 38:33.172
[indistinct chatter]

38:33.207 --> 38:35.382
Mr. Carroll!

38:35.416 --> 38:37.176
Nobody throws a fight in my gym.

38:37.211 --> 38:38.971
-Whatever.
-We won that fair and square!

38:39.006 --> 38:40.939
-Yes!
-Whoo!

38:40.973 --> 38:44.701
-Come on, Steve!
-Yes.

38:44.736 --> 38:46.116
-Come on!
-Yeah!

38:46.151 --> 38:49.154
Come on! Yeah!

38:49.844 --> 38:52.813
[panting]

38:52.847 --> 38:55.125
That's it, Becca.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.644
So I hope you earned
enough money.

38:56.679 --> 38:59.337
Yeah. We did.

39:01.028 --> 39:03.444
I won't ask you
to fight again, Steve.

39:03.479 --> 39:05.619
Freddie shouldn't have asked you
in the first place.

39:07.206 --> 39:09.347
No, he shouldn't have.

39:11.832 --> 39:15.560
It was too much,
forcing you back into the ring.

39:15.594 --> 39:17.493
[Fergus]
But you're a good brother.

39:17.527 --> 39:20.081
When he told you how much debt
he was in, you agreed to do it.

39:20.116 --> 39:24.189
And then he told you he needed
more than the prize money.

39:24.223 --> 39:25.846
[panting]

39:25.880 --> 39:26.950
He asked you to throw the fight.

39:26.985 --> 39:28.883
No. No, no, no.

39:28.918 --> 39:31.438
He, he-he, he did, he didn't.
He wouldn't.

39:31.472 --> 39:33.198
He asked you to do what?

39:33.232 --> 39:36.512
And that was the straw
that broke you, wasn't it?

39:36.546 --> 39:39.963
Then you lashed out.
You hit him with the weight.

39:39.998 --> 39:41.965
[panting]
He was my brother.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.933
Look, he wouldn't. I wouldn't.

39:43.967 --> 39:44.968
[child screaming]

39:45.003 --> 39:48.075
[distant gunshots]

39:49.973 --> 39:51.458
[panting]

39:51.492 --> 39:53.563
[Steve]Medic! I need a medic!

39:53.598 --> 39:55.979
[panting]

39:56.014 --> 39:57.671
[female #1]No!

39:57.705 --> 39:59.914
-Whoa, whoa! No! No! Steve!
-Stop! Stop!

39:59.949 --> 40:01.882
Drop it! No! No! No! No!

40:01.916 --> 40:03.677
[panting]

40:03.711 --> 40:05.437
You're safe, Steve.

40:07.543 --> 40:09.993
What Freddie did wasn't right.

40:10.028 --> 40:11.616
I mean, he loved you, but he,

40:11.650 --> 40:14.515
he should never have put
that stress on you.

40:14.550 --> 40:17.656
Listen to me.
This won't help.

40:17.691 --> 40:20.659
[panting]

40:26.044 --> 40:28.184
[Steve sobbing]

40:30.876 --> 40:32.188
[sniffles]

40:32.222 --> 40:34.121
I didn't mean to kill him.

40:34.155 --> 40:35.812
[sighs]

40:35.847 --> 40:39.954
He'd been on my back. I just
couldn't cope with the pressure.

40:39.989 --> 40:41.508
[sobbing]
I just saw red,

40:41.542 --> 40:44.511
and I-I had the weight
in my hand.

40:44.545 --> 40:47.203
[sniffles]
I wanted to call the police,

40:47.237 --> 40:49.723
but, but Paddy,
Paddy had seen everything.

40:49.757 --> 40:54.072
He, he said
he'd take care of it.

40:55.107 --> 40:56.177
[sniffles] I was horrified

40:56.212 --> 40:58.766
when I found out what he'd done.

40:58.801 --> 41:00.492
He chopping him up.

41:02.252 --> 41:04.565
I should have gone
to the police. I should have...

41:04.600 --> 41:06.947
[sobbing]
I should have...

41:06.981 --> 41:09.328
[Becca sobbing]

41:09.363 --> 41:13.125
It was an accident. It's okay.

41:13.160 --> 41:14.886
[Harry] Time to call the guards.

41:18.234 --> 41:20.719
[traffic bustling]

41:21.858 --> 41:24.067
Lola told them.

41:24.102 --> 41:25.517
They wanted to be here for you.

41:25.552 --> 41:29.797
-You alright, son?
-Uh, yeah. Thanks.

41:38.116 --> 41:39.566
Hey.

41:40.877 --> 41:42.776
Whatever you need, okay?

41:42.810 --> 41:44.191
Yeah.

41:44.225 --> 41:46.331
We're all here for you, Fergus.

41:46.365 --> 41:48.575
Thanks.

41:48.609 --> 41:51.267
Feels like
drinks should be on the house.

41:51.301 --> 41:53.649
You wanna put your card
behind the bar, Harry?

41:53.683 --> 41:56.721
Glenn, that's not
what on the house means.

41:56.755 --> 41:58.550
-Oh, isn't it?
-Don't worry. On me.

41:58.585 --> 42:00.863
-I got 'em.
-Another round.

42:00.897 --> 42:02.692
Same again please, Glenn.

42:02.727 --> 42:06.765
Made up my mind, Harry.
I'm gonna fight her.

42:06.800 --> 42:10.838
Of course you are.
And I'm gonna help you.

42:10.873 --> 42:12.840
-You mean it?
-Mm-hmm.

42:12.875 --> 42:15.947
The last time Paula
dropped a bomb on your life,

42:15.981 --> 42:19.226
well, no offence to your father,
but you had to cope on your own.

42:20.814 --> 42:22.229
You're not on your own anymore.

42:22.263 --> 42:25.197
[instrumental music]

42:25.232 --> 42:26.854
[chuckles]

42:31.031 --> 42:32.688
We're gonna win this.

42:32.722 --> 42:35.035
-Damn right we are.
-Yeah.

42:35.069 --> 42:37.416
[laughing]

42:37.451 --> 42:38.625
Come here.

42:38.659 --> 42:40.937
[all laughing]

42:40.972 --> 42:42.905
Come on.

42:42.939 --> 42:45.908
[instrumental music]

43:15.903 --> 43:18.872
[music continues]

43:46.727 --> 43:49.696
[music continues]
