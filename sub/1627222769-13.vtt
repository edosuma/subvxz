00:52.919 --> 00:54.120
Yes, Doctor.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.622
[Crane]<i> I've had</i>
<i>a change of heart.</i>

00:55.722 --> 00:57.457
<i>As satisfying</i>

00:57.557 --> 00:58.958
<i>Barbara Gordon's reaction</i>

00:59.059 --> 01:02.595
I realize now I don't need
an audience.

01:02.695 --> 01:06.533
But I know that her fate is
very much of interest to you.

01:06.599 --> 01:09.803
So... I give her to you.

01:09.903 --> 01:14.140
She's yours to do with
as you please. Have at it!

01:14.240 --> 01:15.809
-Consider it done.
<i>-Good.</i>

01:15.909 --> 01:18.144
And Doctor,
the security cameras
at the armory

01:18.244 --> 01:21.381
caught your friend, Red Hood.
He was with Dick Grayson.

01:22.449 --> 01:23.416
That's excellent.

01:24.284 --> 01:25.218
It's good.

01:26.052 --> 01:27.887
It's very good. Okay.

01:27.954 --> 01:29.823
It seems he found his way back,

01:29.923 --> 01:31.558
and he's received
my little gift.

01:33.126 --> 01:34.094

Gentlemen, I can't begin
to tell you the number of ways

01:47.440 --> 01:50.777
this is a bad idea.
Actually, no, I can.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.313
Commissioner Gordon is
still your commander

01:53.413 --> 01:55.682
and any attempt
to harm her will

01:55.782 --> 01:57.450
come back
to bite you in the ass.

01:57.517 --> 02:01.321
And that's if she doesn't
take care of you herself.

02:01.421 --> 02:03.323
You do realize she's armed?

02:05.959 --> 02:07.127
Last chance.

02:10.263 --> 02:11.197
Okay.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.810
It's not personal. Just orders.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.012
I was really hoping
you wouldn't say that.

[elevator rumbling]

02:34.454 --> 02:35.788
[elevator dings]

02:38.391 --> 02:39.893
[Vee] You need
to put that thing down

02:39.993 --> 02:41.561
or we're going
to have a problem.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.203
Are you ready to get to work?

02:52.639 --> 02:54.040
The main building is secured,

02:54.140 --> 02:56.309
but there are still
rogue GCPD units

02:56.376 --> 02:57.911
out in the city,

02:58.011 --> 02:59.879
Secured by whom?

03:01.014 --> 03:03.349
Okay, full disclosure.

03:04.551 --> 03:06.319
I don't really work for GCPD.

03:06.386 --> 03:09.422
Yeah, I use the gym
and the Costco discount,

03:09.522 --> 03:13.159
but I was actually sent here
by A.R.G.U.S.

03:13.226 --> 03:15.094
to monitor
suspicious super activity.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.763
after Ra's Al Ghul started

03:16.863 --> 03:19.065
poking his nose
around these parts.

03:19.165 --> 03:21.367
A.R.G.U.S.
Like Roy Harper A.R.G.U.S?

03:21.434 --> 03:23.570
The one and only.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.772
Oh, he sends his regards,
by the way.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.041
Is Vee even your real name?

03:28.107 --> 03:30.677
Depends. Do you like it?

03:30.743 --> 03:33.046
-It suits you.
-Okay.

03:33.112 --> 03:34.581
Then, we'll keep it.

03:34.681 --> 03:36.349
I have other news.

03:36.416 --> 03:39.586
We suspect
that Ra's Al Ghul was here

03:39.686 --> 03:41.087
to place a Lazarus Pit

03:41.187 --> 03:43.556
as a first step
in a larger plan.

03:43.623 --> 03:47.393
And we believe that Crane used
it to resurrect Jason Todd.

03:49.429 --> 03:50.563
There's more.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.199
It's a good thing
you're sitting down.

03:53.266 --> 03:54.701
Why?

03:54.767 --> 03:56.436
Dick Grayson is alive.

03:58.471 --> 03:59.606
What?

03:59.706 --> 04:02.041
His Titan friends took him
to the Pit

04:02.108 --> 04:04.577
and he came out alive.

04:04.644 --> 04:07.547
Now, we're not sure
what they're doing yet,

04:07.614 --> 04:09.148
but we're using
the A.R.G.U.S. satellite

04:09.249 --> 04:11.284
to try and track
the Titans right now.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.053
Okay.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.421
Time to save Gotham.

04:16.389 --> 04:17.924
[door opens]

04:24.597 --> 04:27.900
I took the liberty of making
a few staffing changes.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.471
HR is going to be pissed.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.254
On your three!

04:54.694 --> 04:56.629
Where the hell
did you learn how to do that?

04:56.696 --> 04:57.864

Uh, Donna.

Go back with your family,
I'll deal with them.

-You can't--
-Go!

Why don't you get out
of that fur suit

05:54.187 --> 05:55.254
and come say hi?

05:57.590 --> 06:00.259
Jeez, you look good
for someone who's undead.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.929
Oh, that's sweet.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.099
Hey, look. Lydia told me
that you held vigil for me.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.700
I really appreciate that.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.569
Well, it probably did more
for me than it did for you,

06:09.669 --> 06:11.738
but, hey, I tried.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.506
Funny how that works, huh?

06:14.507 --> 06:15.608
Hey, kiddo.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.276
If it ain't Wonder Girl,
the sequel?

06:20.179 --> 06:22.415
We have to go.
Dick sent us to find you.

06:22.515 --> 06:24.617
There's something going down
with Crane.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.252
[siren wailing in distance]

06:26.352 --> 06:28.054
I think we're going to need
a minute.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.289
Bro. Impressive.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.858
Seriously.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.092
I didn't know
you had it in you.

06:33.192 --> 06:34.961
Neither did I.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.295
[Jack] We better get moving.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.530
You need to say goodbye
to your friends?

06:40.700 --> 06:41.601
I'm good.

06:42.802 --> 06:43.770
Let's go.

06:47.206 --> 06:48.374
You need to stay.

06:49.642 --> 06:51.277
This is where you belong.

06:51.377 --> 06:53.913
We need you,
but Gotham needs you more.

06:54.881 --> 06:55.815
She's right.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.050
We'll be fine.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.122
Do us proud.

07:06.659 --> 07:07.493
I will.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.185
Called it.

07:42.161 --> 07:43.796
[coughing]

07:46.032 --> 07:47.700
[Starfire] You did this?

07:47.800 --> 07:49.135
-I didn't mean to.
-You didn't mean to what?

07:49.202 --> 07:51.838
Blow up her ship?
Her only way back home?

07:52.972 --> 07:54.874
You know what
cowards hide behind?

07:55.608 --> 07:57.143
Intentions.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.879
I'm sick of people telling me
what they didn't mean to do

07:59.979 --> 08:01.147
after they did it!

08:01.214 --> 08:02.949
[barking]

08:03.015 --> 08:05.351
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry's not enough!

08:05.451 --> 08:06.285
Starfire.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.556
I don't blame him.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.891
[Starfire] Excuse me?

08:11.991 --> 08:14.126
Did he not just blow up
your ship?

08:14.193 --> 08:16.462
Yes, he acted selfishly.

08:16.529 --> 08:19.232
And I would have done
the same thing if I were him.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.168
Some of us have to fight
for what we get.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.904
And do stupid things along
the way.

08:26.906 --> 08:28.708
After everything
we've gone through,

08:28.808 --> 08:30.309
you're just going
to forgive this?

08:30.376 --> 08:33.412
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
but whatever it is,

08:33.513 --> 08:35.915
it sure as shit is not going
to bring my ship back.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.650
[clears throat]
On a purely technical level,

08:37.717 --> 08:39.018
I can confirm that.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.052
Not now.

08:41.487 --> 08:42.355
You know what?

08:44.056 --> 08:45.725
I'm done with this bullshit.

08:55.935 --> 08:57.770
One poem, multiple bombs.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.606
Clues to where the bombs are
are placed in the poem.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.008
What's the plan?

09:02.074 --> 09:04.710
Find some supers and stop
the bombs from going off.

Titans?

09:07.046 --> 09:08.781
What are they gonna do

09:09.715 --> 09:10.783
They're not.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.354
-What's going on?
-Get out.

09:15.421 --> 09:17.256
-Out?
-I can't bring you back
to the Titans.

09:17.356 --> 09:19.692
It'll cause a war.
But I do need you.

09:19.759 --> 09:21.294
So I'm
your dirty little secret?

09:21.394 --> 09:23.296
You want to help us,
this is the way it's gonna be.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.298
I can only fight
one war at a time.

09:27.099 --> 09:28.734
When do you need me?

Yeah, I'm fine. Are you?

09:57.763 --> 10:00.466
I'm fine. Vee busted me out.

Apparently she's working
for A.R.G.U.S.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.905
We are now.

Long story. Basically,
Vee isn't who she said she was.

10:08.941 --> 10:12.144
But who is really?

10:12.244 --> 10:15.014

13:31.310 --> 13:32.711
But there are
also four branches

13:32.812 --> 13:34.647
of the Wayne Institute
for Child Development,

13:34.713 --> 13:36.482
each with a program
for disabled kids,

13:36.549 --> 13:38.184
including the deaf.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.286
Do you think he'd target them
because of Bruce's connection?

13:40.352 --> 13:42.221
Find the one closest
to midtown.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.824
Near hotels, hospitals,
apartment buildings.

13:45.858 --> 13:47.726
He'd want maximum damage.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.796
-Guys, anything?
-The name Nijinksy comes up
in line 59.

13:50.863 --> 13:53.532
So far, we found a restaurant,
a performing arts center

13:53.632 --> 13:55.301
and about
12 private residences.

13:55.367 --> 13:56.802
The arts center is only
a block from here.

13:56.869 --> 13:58.671
Maybe some X-ray vision
for a quick sweep?

13:58.737 --> 14:01.740
I could try, but if Crane's got
the bombs in lead containers...

14:01.841 --> 14:03.909
Let's hope he doesn't.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.845
Hey, how's it coming along?

14:05.911 --> 14:07.680
Like trying to find
ten invisible needles

14:07.746 --> 14:09.048
in a thousand haystacks.

14:09.148 --> 14:10.583
At the bottom of the ocean.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.884
Look, if these bombs go off,

14:11.984 --> 14:13.252
we'll need a plan
to save these people.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.854
It's a deadly toxin.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.589
I don't know what kind of plan
we're talking about, Dick.

14:19.091 --> 14:20.693
The Lazarus Pit.

14:20.759 --> 14:24.163
Yeah, but we can't bring
the whole city to the Pit.

14:24.230 --> 14:27.366
Unless we can somehow figure
out a way to bring the Pit
to the city.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.502
Try to find a way.

14:30.569 --> 14:32.238
Don't expect miracles here.

14:32.338 --> 14:34.440
I absolutely expect miracles.
Let me know when you have one.

14:39.912 --> 14:41.580
Hey Conner, can I talk to you
for a second?

14:45.718 --> 14:46.685
Listen, about what happened...

14:46.752 --> 14:48.354
You did what you had to do.

14:49.455 --> 14:50.856
I know what it's like.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.893
I did what I had to do, too.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.763
We have bigger things
to worry about now.

15:15.648 --> 15:16.815
All right. Everybody, stop.

15:17.917 --> 15:18.784
Forget the poem.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.120
Forget the clues.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.057
We've been
going about this all wrong.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.661
-[phone beeps]
-Barb?

15:28.761 --> 15:29.895
[Barbara]<i> Talk to me.</i>

15:29.962 --> 15:30.930
This, all of this,

15:30.996 --> 15:32.564
<i>all of us wracking our brains,</i>

15:32.631 --> 15:33.832
following clues,
chasing our tails.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.068
We're playing right into
his hands.

15:36.135 --> 15:37.803
Oh, Dick, slow down.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.838
This is all just
a fucking game to him.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.907
He wants us to run around
Gotham looking for his bombs,

15:41.974 --> 15:43.943
<i>-just like Batman would've.</i>
-He's right.

15:44.009 --> 15:45.477
You're right.

15:45.577 --> 15:47.279
To him, you and I might as well
just be Bruce and Jim.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.281
It's the same old game over
and over again.

15:49.348 --> 15:50.749
So let's not play it anymore.

15:50.816 --> 15:53.419
Wait. We're not going
to look for the bombs?

15:53.485 --> 15:55.020
[Dick]<i> No, we're not.</i>

15:55.120 --> 15:56.956
Can the A.R.G.U.S. satellite
initiate a computer override?

15:57.022 --> 15:58.958
Uh, yeah. If we can establish

15:59.024 --> 16:01.160
remote access
to the mainframe, maybe.

16:01.260 --> 16:02.861
-Why?
<i>-We're going to beat Crane</i>

16:02.962 --> 16:04.596
<i>by doing</i>
<i>what Batman never would.</i>

16:04.663 --> 16:08.267
We're going to Wayne Manor,
but not the way he expects.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.501
[Starfire] Um, Dick...

16:12.304 --> 16:14.606
About that miracle
you asked for...

16:17.376 --> 16:20.546
[Crane]<i> ♪ I could</i>

16:41.233 --> 16:43.635
Okay, So I'll try
to keep this simple.

16:43.702 --> 16:46.405
You have cold moist air
over here, see?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.407
And then hot air over here.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.909
Add in
some atmospheric particulates,

16:51.010 --> 16:54.346
mix well, and, well,
the result is obvious.

16:55.414 --> 16:56.882
Yeah, we get it.

16:56.982 --> 16:59.918
But a storm was our idea.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.587
We literally
just told you that.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.022
But I drew it on the board.

17:05.157 --> 17:06.325
-Yes, you did.
-Okay, cool.

17:06.392 --> 17:07.693
But the question is,

17:07.760 --> 17:09.161
can we do it without
getting ourselves killed?

17:10.329 --> 17:11.930
Only one way to find out.

17:23.342 --> 17:24.610
All right, here's the plan.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.045
We need to get
inside Wayne manor

17:26.111 --> 17:27.946
before Crane sets off
the other bombs

17:28.047 --> 17:29.581
Kory, Rachel and Blackfire
are gonna drain

17:29.681 --> 17:31.617
the Lazarus pit, and use it
to try and bring back

17:31.717 --> 17:32.951
people that have already died.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.354
There's not enough
for the whole city.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.356
So we have
exactly one shot at this.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.628
Wait. Why are
you looking at me?

17:44.463 --> 17:46.732
You saved my life
by turning into a bat.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.535
You think you can do it again?

17:49.601 --> 17:51.703
I'm pretty sure I can't.

17:51.770 --> 17:53.439
When I did it,
when I turned into a bat

17:53.539 --> 17:57.076
I was part of a hive mind,
thinking with a hundred brains.

17:57.142 --> 17:59.611
It was loud and confusing,

17:59.711 --> 18:01.980
and I was flying.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.616
I was so dizzy afterwards,
I could barely walk.

18:04.716 --> 18:06.485
I didn't say it'd be easy.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.454
But once you get inside,
I need you to go to the keypad

18:08.554 --> 18:10.456
in the hall and shut off
the security system.

18:10.556 --> 18:13.325
Barbara needs to access
Wayne Manor's computer network.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.927
There's a router in my room.

18:14.993 --> 18:17.096
When you get in, I'll talk you
through setting it up.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.998
Okay.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.967
Okay. I'm in.

18:22.067 --> 18:23.969
Wait, uh, what's the code?

18:24.069 --> 18:27.639
Well, it's five digits
and the last person
to set it up was Jason Todd.

18:28.774 --> 18:29.775
Got it.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.009
Wait, what is it?

18:32.344 --> 18:34.146
Four-twenty, sixty-nine.

18:35.681 --> 18:36.748
That tracks.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.284
Dick, I didn't wanna
say anything,

18:39.351 --> 18:42.121
but Wayne Manor is
crawling with GCPD.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.423
When they hear the alarm,
Gar's cooked.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.792
Don't worry.
I've got that covered.

18:50.496 --> 18:53.432
[cop 1] You're not gonna
believe who we caught
outside trying to get in.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.959
[Blackfire] There's something
very wrong about this place.

19:21.026 --> 19:24.329
It absorbs the worst fears
and nightmares

19:24.396 --> 19:25.964
of anyone
who's ever been in it.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.636
Extremely dark magic.

19:30.702 --> 19:31.970
Too dark for you?

19:32.671 --> 19:33.505
No.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.242
And if it goes wrong?

19:37.342 --> 19:39.211
It's the last thing
we'll ever do.

19:41.046 --> 19:43.081
You don't have to do this.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.750
Do you think I'm afraid?

19:44.850 --> 19:46.051
You should be.

19:47.653 --> 19:48.487
I am.

19:53.592 --> 19:54.526
[Blackfire] I'm ready.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.264
Me too.

20:00.599 --> 20:02.167
Then what are we waiting for?

20:47.112 --> 20:49.881
What in the actual fuck
are you trying to pull here?

20:49.948 --> 20:51.316
Crane is done with you.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.485
I saw what he did downtown.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.786
Let's just say
I'd rather be in here

20:54.886 --> 20:56.488
when the next bomb goes off.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.890
What the fuck makes you think
he'll take you back?

21:00.292 --> 21:01.493
Pretty sure is getting tired

21:01.593 --> 21:03.228
of dealing
with his second string.

21:05.964 --> 21:07.299
Doctor Crane?

21:07.399 --> 21:08.834
[Crane]<i> Yes.</i>

21:08.934 --> 21:10.002
Red Hood is here.

21:11.336 --> 21:12.671
Bring him down.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.574
Maybe it's important
that he be here for the end.

21:15.641 --> 21:17.242
Then when it's over, kill him.

21:18.810 --> 21:19.978
Thank you, Doctor.

21:23.148 --> 21:25.817
Take him down.
I'm gonna go outside,

21:25.917 --> 21:28.020
and see if we have
any other visitors here.

gone inside if I had?

The Lazarus Pit isn't
gonna do much good

29:26.731 --> 29:28.433
if we burn the city
to the ground.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.268
-[Donna] I'm on it.
-Wait a second. No.

29:30.335 --> 29:32.971
You're gonna get
yourself killed, again.

about lightning.

30:06.471 --> 30:07.705
And my only wish is

30:07.806 --> 30:10.041
that Bruce Wayne could
be here to see this.

30:10.141 --> 30:13.511
But all the same. Good night.

You didn't detonate anything.

All your clever hopes

31:05.864 --> 31:07.198
and dreams just expired?

Hey, Tim. You always wanted
to see the Batcave.

31:14.005 --> 31:15.440
Well, here it is.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.708

31:16.774 --> 31:18.376
I think it's a little crowded.

I agree.

that everything was okay-- Oh.

33:32.477 --> 33:33.711
Thanks.

God, these things
are very stuffy.

I came as soon as I got

It's a brilliant plan.

uh... you guys mind
if I get a selfie?

Yeah. I told you this day was
going to be amazing!

35:07.238 --> 35:09.440
I'm lucky
to have a home at all.

35:09.507 --> 35:11.476
A lot of people had it
much worse.

35:17.081 --> 35:18.349
Do me a favor.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.318
Next time you decide
to leave town,

35:21.285 --> 35:22.487
don't.

35:23.988 --> 35:26.023
You did what I asked you to do.

35:27.158 --> 35:28.926
You saved Gotham City.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.264
I had help.

35:33.331 --> 35:35.800
-The Titans?
-And Barbara.

35:38.669 --> 35:41.005
You succeeded where I failed.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.808
I failed too, Bruce.

35:47.311 --> 35:48.946
But I got a second chance.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.288
[sighs]

36:10.835 --> 36:12.503
Coming here wasn't my idea.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.076
Can you forgive me?

36:21.879 --> 36:23.548
But you can't forgive me.

36:25.416 --> 36:27.051
There was a time
when that would have been true,

36:27.151 --> 36:28.352
Jason, but...

36:30.721 --> 36:34.692
we've all crossed lines,
starting with me.

36:34.759 --> 36:36.727
I did things
I can't come back from.

36:38.362 --> 36:39.597
Do you want to come back?

36:42.500 --> 36:43.401
Here?

36:47.772 --> 36:48.706
No.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.410
That life is over.

36:55.346 --> 36:56.881
What life is next?

36:57.682 --> 36:58.950
I don't know.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.586
The fear that you felt,

37:02.853 --> 37:05.189
I refused to see it,

37:05.256 --> 37:07.625
because it's something
that you and I share.

37:09.594 --> 37:11.462
It held sway over us.

37:13.130 --> 37:15.533
But fear is a bad mentor.

37:18.736 --> 37:21.706
I wish I'd had the strength
to help you face yours.

37:24.642 --> 37:26.110

37:27.144 --> 37:28.579
did you do that for me?

37:31.382 --> 37:33.317
Yes, I did.

Thank you.

I want to be right now.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.117
I promise it'll be worth it.

38:06.183 --> 38:07.518
Okay, everyone ready?

Ta-da!

[chuckles]

38:14.959 --> 38:16.193
I don't understand.

38:19.497 --> 38:21.432
How were you able to do this?

38:21.499 --> 38:25.369
Well, your friend here has
a hell of a memory.

38:25.469 --> 38:26.771
It's like a computer.

38:29.206 --> 38:30.708
So there's still a chance?

38:30.808 --> 38:32.610
It won't even take
that long to build.

38:32.677 --> 38:34.545
My 3-D printer can do
a lot of the little things,

38:34.645 --> 38:35.880
and, you know, there's always

38:35.980 --> 38:37.715
your preferred
online retail provider.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.183
It was the least I could do.

38:40.484 --> 38:43.387
What I did was pretty selfish.

38:43.487 --> 38:46.057
If you really want
to go back to Tamaran,

38:46.157 --> 38:48.159
I have no right to stop you.

38:48.225 --> 38:49.393
Thank you.

39:03.074 --> 39:05.009
Hi, Commissioner Gordon
called me.

was looking to see me.

39:07.978 --> 39:10.047
I did. Margarita Vee.

39:11.515 --> 39:14.352
I've had my eye on you
for quite a while now.

39:15.419 --> 39:17.188
-Thank you.
-[Vee chuckles]

39:17.254 --> 39:20.758
[Vee] Remember when you
and Starfire brought
down Shimmer?

39:20.858 --> 39:22.360
That file ended up on my desk.

39:22.426 --> 39:27.031
Closed case. We could
always use more of those.

39:27.098 --> 39:29.600
-You're with A.R.G.U.S.
-Uh-huh. And you're dead.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.102
Well, according
to our database.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.204
So, you can imagine my surprise

39:33.270 --> 39:35.740
when you showed up
in Gotham alive and kicking.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.943
-I'm full of surprises.
-Hmm.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.778
What are your plans
for your second life?

39:40.878 --> 39:45.049
Uh, spend less time
in mysterious conversations.

39:47.017 --> 39:48.386
I think I can remember that.

39:48.452 --> 39:50.621
[Vee] Oh, no. See,
this one's got a chip in it.

39:50.721 --> 39:51.789
You just hold it up
to your phone

39:51.889 --> 39:52.923
and it dials for you.

39:53.023 --> 39:55.226
Pretty cool.

39:55.292 --> 39:57.595
-Well, not my idea.
-[Donna smiles]

39:58.529 --> 39:59.797
You should give me a call.

40:07.605 --> 40:09.240
I thought maybe
you'd have a day or two off

40:09.306 --> 40:10.441
before jumping right back

40:10.541 --> 40:12.643
into rebuilding
the police force.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.211
What police force?

40:14.278 --> 40:15.446
Good point.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.415
So, now what?

40:17.481 --> 40:18.983
Well, since A.R.G.U.S is
already on the scene--

40:19.083 --> 40:20.418
Why not make the most of it?

40:20.484 --> 40:21.619
Why not?

40:22.620 --> 40:23.921
Have 'em stick around,

40:23.988 --> 40:25.990
help us build back
better than ever.

40:26.824 --> 40:27.992
-I like it.
-Oh.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.427
And the A.R.G.U.S Satellite is

40:29.493 --> 40:31.429
working to bring
Oracle back online.

40:31.495 --> 40:34.632
And if it can, I'm the only one
who can handle him.

40:34.732 --> 40:36.400
And what if he doesn't
forgive you for--

40:36.467 --> 40:37.835
Destroying him?

40:37.935 --> 40:39.336
Yeah.

40:39.437 --> 40:43.073
Well, what's a partnership
without a little conflict?

40:44.408 --> 40:45.609
True.

40:49.146 --> 40:50.915
Speaking of...

40:52.750 --> 40:54.585
do I need to worry
about Red Hood?

40:55.786 --> 40:58.022
No. He's leaving Gotham.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.958
How are the Titans taking it?

41:03.527 --> 41:04.862
Very differently.

41:04.962 --> 41:08.365
Gar always saw
the person behind the hood,

41:08.466 --> 41:11.001
and he knows how far Jason went
to helping us out in the end.

41:11.802 --> 41:13.170
And the others?

41:13.270 --> 41:15.105
-We'll see.
-Hmm.

41:15.840 --> 41:16.874
And you?

41:19.310 --> 41:21.212
We made our peace.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.313
Good.

41:24.849 --> 41:26.317
So you're heading out?

41:27.852 --> 41:29.453
You could always come with.

41:31.155 --> 41:33.023
You could always stay.

41:42.366 --> 41:45.402
Listen, Barb,
I wanted to stay...

41:45.503 --> 41:46.637
It's okay.

41:47.638 --> 41:49.039
I'll see you next time.

41:51.509 --> 41:52.676
See you next time.

41:55.913 --> 41:57.047
Hey, Dick.

42:01.519 --> 42:02.486
Thank you.

42:07.157 --> 42:08.058
Yeah.

42:10.661 --> 42:11.695
Thank you.

42:23.674 --> 42:25.609
You asked her to go
to San Francisco with you,
didn't you?

42:25.709 --> 42:27.711
-And she asked me to stay here.
-Mm.

42:27.778 --> 42:31.782
And yet here you are,
walking off alone, again.

42:31.882 --> 42:33.918
Never alone when you're around.

42:34.018 --> 42:35.853
So, we'll be seeing you
in San Francisco?

42:35.920 --> 42:37.221
Probably not.

42:37.288 --> 42:39.890
No, I think I'm headed
to Paris to see Dawn.

42:39.957 --> 42:42.393
I've got a message from Hank
I need to deliver.

42:42.459 --> 42:43.861
After that?

42:43.928 --> 42:47.565
You never know. There's always
more bad guys than good.

42:47.631 --> 42:51.235
Maybe I can figure a way
even out the odds a little.

42:51.302 --> 42:52.636
Congrats, by the way.

42:53.304 --> 42:54.305
For what?

42:54.405 --> 42:55.873
Finding Nightwing.

42:56.941 --> 42:58.475
Starting to.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.811
And all I had to do
to find him was die.

43:00.911 --> 43:02.046
[Donna chuckles]

43:02.112 --> 43:04.415
Now, I will say this.

43:04.481 --> 43:07.217
The one thing about dying
and coming back,

43:07.284 --> 43:09.486
it sure sets
your priorities straight.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.058
You want to come for a drive?

43:15.059 --> 43:16.327
Come on.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.596

43:20.931 --> 43:22.633

43:22.733 --> 43:25.169
-He did say ten, right?
-He said ten.

43:25.269 --> 43:26.804
He'll get here.

43:26.904 --> 43:28.405
Eventually.

43:28.472 --> 43:29.506
He always does.

43:33.811 --> 43:36.680
Hey, did someone order a bus?

43:36.780 --> 43:38.015
[vehicle approaching]

43:38.682 --> 43:40.084
[bus honks]

43:51.462 --> 43:53.964
Hey, Dick, uh, what is that?

43:54.932 --> 43:56.333
That's an RV.

43:56.433 --> 43:58.502
I figured it'd be way more fun
than taking Bruce's Jet.

44:01.472 --> 44:03.207
Why would that be a more fun?

44:05.876 --> 44:07.111
Road trip!

44:08.846 --> 44:11.015
Right, 'cause who would
want to fly in the Bat jet?

44:11.115 --> 44:12.282
Exactly.

44:22.159 --> 44:24.028
Before you go,

44:24.128 --> 44:26.730
I wanted to thank you.

44:26.830 --> 44:30.234
I'm really glad
things turned out
the way they did.

44:30.334 --> 44:32.736
Maybe it's a new start for us.

44:32.836 --> 44:35.372
You know those kind of sisters
who are also best friends?

44:35.472 --> 44:36.373
Mm-hmm.

44:36.473 --> 44:38.042
Yeah, we're nothing like that.

44:38.742 --> 44:40.310
Yeah.

44:40.377 --> 44:42.546
-But at least now--
-We don't want
to kill each other.

44:42.646 --> 44:44.748
-We don't.
-It's a start.

44:46.050 --> 44:48.919
Maybe one day
I'll make it back to Tamaran.

44:49.019 --> 44:50.587
I'd like that.

44:50.688 --> 44:52.356
But people there are tough.

44:53.991 --> 44:56.894
They don't tend to forgive
and forget easily.

44:56.994 --> 44:59.196
I'll be there if you need me.

44:59.263 --> 45:00.864
I know.

45:00.931 --> 45:02.766
But I also know
that I am not alone.

45:03.867 --> 45:05.002
Thank you

45:15.045 --> 45:16.113
Take care of these humans.

45:16.213 --> 45:17.281
[Kory laughs]

45:23.754 --> 45:25.355
And I have some news.

45:26.724 --> 45:29.026
I've spoken to Artie Kind.

45:29.093 --> 45:30.761
He's looking
into something that he calls

45:30.861 --> 45:33.697
a "nitrogen-filter
respiratory device."

45:33.764 --> 45:35.632
So I could breathe on Tamaran?

45:35.733 --> 45:37.901
Perhaps one day
you could visit me, too.

46:02.292 --> 46:04.428
I got a great idea.

46:04.495 --> 46:05.963
Let's get the hell
out of Gotham.

46:10.334 --> 46:11.335
Love you, too.

46:25.149 --> 46:26.583
For what it's worth,

46:26.650 --> 46:29.753
I think you would have made
a pretty decent Robin.

46:32.956 --> 46:34.091
You coming?

46:35.926 --> 46:37.361
Are you serious?

46:37.461 --> 46:39.763
The question is, are you?

46:39.830 --> 46:42.332
You got some nice moves,
but you need proper training,

46:43.667 --> 46:44.868
if you're up for it.

46:56.980 --> 46:58.816
Right. Destination
San Francisco.

46:58.882 --> 46:59.983
Forty-four hours.

47:00.050 --> 47:01.785
Forty-four hours?

47:01.852 --> 47:02.786
Yeah, I know.

47:03.554 --> 47:05.155
Okay, fine.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.357
But I get to DJ.

47:07.457 --> 47:09.526
But first, one more stop.

47:10.327 --> 47:11.295
Okay.

47:28.045 --> 47:29.546
Welly, welly, well.

47:32.583 --> 47:34.184
We've come full circle,
haven't we?

47:34.251 --> 47:35.819
[Crane laughs]

47:38.055 --> 47:40.424
Have you come for some more
crime-solving advice?

47:40.524 --> 47:43.260
[chuckles] You know
I'm off their payroll now?

47:43.360 --> 47:44.862
Although I bet you
and I could work out

47:44.928 --> 47:46.763
some sort
of a private arrangement.

47:46.864 --> 47:50.734
It'd be kind of hard to smoke
with your hands all... tied up.

47:52.035 --> 47:53.437
Yeah. You got me there.

47:54.538 --> 47:57.541
But, see this, all this,

47:57.608 --> 47:59.676
it's just a temporary problem.

48:00.711 --> 48:02.579
This house has many doors,

48:03.447 --> 48:05.182
and they all revolve.

48:06.617 --> 48:08.785
You know how it is.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.954
Gotham is never
going to change,

48:11.054 --> 48:12.389
and I'll be back out
in the fields

48:12.456 --> 48:14.691
before there's frost
on the pumpkins.

48:16.293 --> 48:17.527
Not this time.

48:25.769 --> 48:27.704
Who's this little ragamuffin?

48:27.771 --> 48:29.206
I have something for you.

48:35.479 --> 48:39.249
[snarling]

48:43.553 --> 48:46.823
[screaming]

48:47.557 --> 48:48.992
Pleasant dreams.

48:49.092 --> 49:06.777
[screaming continues]
