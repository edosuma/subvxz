00:01.151 --> 00:04.253
Captioning made possible by
the Disney channel

00:30.380 --> 00:32.281
that's great, Michael.
Good for you.

00:32.314 --> 00:34.983
I know it sounds strange
coming from me, aunt Jules,

00:35.018 --> 00:37.986
but it really feels good
growing your own stuff.

00:38.021 --> 00:39.488
It's hard work, though.

00:39.522 --> 00:42.357
Well, I guess you got
a little farmer in you
after all.

00:42.392 --> 00:44.860
So... Is
Tommy all set to go?

00:44.894 --> 00:47.629
I'd say. He's been packed
for 3 days.

00:47.664 --> 00:50.332
I've gotta admit, Michael,
I'm a little nervous.

00:50.366 --> 00:51.967
Australia's really far away.

00:52.001 --> 00:54.670
I know, but I promise you,
I'm gonna take good care
of him, all right?

00:54.704 --> 00:55.637
Don't worry.

00:55.672 --> 00:56.772
Uh, excuse me, aunt Jules.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.307
Hey, uh... Missed
a couple of weeds

00:58.341 --> 01:00.242
right there, partner.
Ok? Thanks.

01:00.276 --> 01:03.078
It's so hard to get
good help these days.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.115
So, where is Tommy, anyway?

01:07.117 --> 01:08.917
Oh, he's riding up right now.

01:08.952 --> 01:11.253
Hey, Tommy,
Michael's on the phone!

01:11.287 --> 01:13.055
I'll talk to you later, Michael.

01:13.089 --> 01:15.023
Have fun, and be careful.

01:15.058 --> 01:16.391
We will, all right?
And don't worry, aunt jule.

01:16.426 --> 01:19.094
I promise you Tommy
is in very good hands.
All right?

01:19.129 --> 01:20.729
I know.
Here he is.

01:21.631 --> 01:23.098
Hey, Michael.
Hey, bud.

01:23.133 --> 01:26.335
Are you out, uh...
Riding my horse again?

01:26.369 --> 01:28.003
Yeah. He's gotten
really fast.

01:28.037 --> 01:29.938
He's really living
up to his name.

01:29.973 --> 01:32.074
We're going
for a steak sandwich!

01:32.108 --> 01:34.042
Hey, Tommy,
are you ready
to have some fun?

01:34.077 --> 01:35.644
Couldn't be more ready.

01:35.678 --> 01:37.346
Well, guess what. I was
on the, uh, Internet,

01:37.380 --> 01:40.149
and I've decided
that I'm gonna charter
a private yacht

01:40.183 --> 01:41.984
to take us deep-sea
fishing for 2 days

01:42.018 --> 01:43.118
and then on to the resort.

01:43.153 --> 01:44.853
Just you and me.
How cool is that, huh?

01:44.888 --> 01:45.821
Really?

01:45.855 --> 01:47.656
Yeah. I thought
you might like it.

01:47.690 --> 01:49.024
I can't wait.

01:49.058 --> 01:50.726
Me, neither, buddy.
Uh, listen,

01:50.760 --> 01:52.361
um, I'll see you
at the airport.
All right?

01:52.395 --> 01:53.962
All right. Bye.
Ok. Bye.

02:05.809 --> 02:07.442
How's the water?

02:07.477 --> 02:09.077
Oh, it's great, dad.

02:12.182 --> 02:14.116
Want to come in?

02:14.150 --> 02:16.118
Wish I could.

02:16.152 --> 02:17.319
But I've...

02:17.353 --> 02:18.921
Gotta go to work.

02:22.892 --> 02:24.760
Nice tan, Michael.

02:24.794 --> 02:26.495
Oh, thanks. Yeah,
I'm trying to get

02:26.529 --> 02:29.598
a good, uh, you know,
base for... Australia.

02:29.632 --> 02:31.900
Michael, my accountant
just called.

02:31.935 --> 02:34.736
This trip with Tommy
that you're taking
to Australia?

02:34.771 --> 02:38.907
Seems to have come in
at $4,000 more
than you said it would.

02:38.942 --> 02:41.443
Oh, I can explain that.

02:41.477 --> 02:42.678
Oh, please do.

02:42.712 --> 02:45.848
Ok. See, Roxanne
is gonna be in Hawaii.

02:45.882 --> 02:48.750
Right? Which is
practically right
next door to Australia.

02:48.785 --> 02:50.819
So I said, "hey, since
you're in the neighborhood,

02:50.854 --> 02:52.921
come on down and join
Tommy and me."

02:52.956 --> 02:54.523
So you picked up the tab?

02:54.557 --> 02:57.392
Dad, I invited her.

02:58.695 --> 02:59.862
Is this gonna be a problem?

02:59.896 --> 03:02.364
Well, as a matter of fact,
it <i> is</i> a problem.

03:02.398 --> 03:04.066
Michael, you're
spending money
you don't have,

03:04.100 --> 03:06.735
and you don't have
a job to pay it back.

03:06.769 --> 03:09.338
You know, Michael, in my book,

03:09.372 --> 03:13.242
success is when preparation
meets opportunity.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.611
And frankly, Michael,
what you're doing here

03:15.645 --> 03:18.146
has nothing to do
with either one.

03:18.181 --> 03:19.281
Dad, look, i... i...

03:19.315 --> 03:20.249
Now, don't "dad" me.

03:20.283 --> 03:23.185
You're supposed to be
looking for a job,

03:23.219 --> 03:24.920
maybe putting
your education to work.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.889
But, dad, I'm not sure
i want to be an attorney.

03:26.923 --> 03:28.423
Well, our agreement was
whatever you chose,

03:28.458 --> 03:30.259
you'd be employed
by the end of the summer.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.593
Well, I've been looking.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.262
Well, I don't know of
a whole lot of opportunities

03:33.296 --> 03:36.231
you're gonna find
sitting here
in this pool, Michael.

03:36.266 --> 03:39.568
Now, you're going
to pay me back
for Roxanne.

03:39.602 --> 03:42.738
So I suggest
that when you return
from your vacation,

03:42.772 --> 03:44.439
you find that job
that we've been talking about,

03:44.474 --> 03:46.174
or you're gonna
come work for me.

03:49.345 --> 03:51.413
Just like your partner
in your firm?

03:51.447 --> 03:52.915
No, not as a partner
in my firm, Michael.

03:52.949 --> 03:55.751
You'd have to go to law school
and pass the bar exam
to do that.

03:55.785 --> 03:58.487
You're gonna start
the way I started...

03:58.521 --> 04:00.055
As a file clerk.

04:01.457 --> 04:04.092
It's not a punishment, Michael.

04:04.127 --> 04:05.761
It's a job.

04:06.763 --> 04:09.097
Who knows?
You might like it.

04:09.132 --> 04:13.335
I might even treat you
to lunch once in a while.

04:14.637 --> 04:16.071
Think about it.

04:26.449 --> 04:27.916
Here.
Need some help?

04:27.951 --> 04:30.218
No, that's ok.
I can do it.

04:30.253 --> 04:33.922
Here. This is for you...
a little going-away
present.

04:33.957 --> 04:36.725
Thanks. Set it down
over there.

04:36.759 --> 04:37.960
Sure.

04:37.994 --> 04:39.227
Ok.

04:48.271 --> 04:50.806
Don't even say it.
I know what
he's trying to do.

04:50.840 --> 04:51.974
Oh, really?

04:52.008 --> 04:53.942
And what's that?

04:53.977 --> 04:55.777
Helping you unload
the hay yesterday...

04:55.812 --> 04:58.380
Pitching in
with the fence
last week...

04:58.414 --> 05:00.382
Always offering
to drive you into town?

05:00.416 --> 05:01.950
He's a nice guy.

05:01.985 --> 05:03.819
Neighbors help each other out.

05:03.853 --> 05:06.555
Ok. What about making
dinner? Steak sandwiches?

05:06.589 --> 05:08.890
Everybody's gotta eat.

05:08.925 --> 05:10.659
You know what I'm trying to say.

05:11.594 --> 05:13.495
He likes you.

05:16.299 --> 05:17.399
Well...

05:18.468 --> 05:21.236
I like him, too.

05:21.270 --> 05:23.605
Just because you do
doesn't mean I have to.

05:23.639 --> 05:25.807
Honey...

05:25.842 --> 05:29.077
Look, I don't know
how to explain it.

05:29.112 --> 05:31.213
I just don't want another dad.

05:32.181 --> 05:33.281
Honey.

05:34.350 --> 05:37.085
Nobody's trying
to replace your dad.

05:39.122 --> 05:41.289
Good...'Cause
no one will.

05:41.324 --> 05:44.126
Of course not.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.594
Oh, come on.

05:45.628 --> 05:47.396
Give him half a chance.

05:47.430 --> 05:51.333
Maybe there's room if you
really want to be friends.

05:54.971 --> 05:56.772
All right, let's get going.

05:56.806 --> 05:58.774
You don't want
to miss your plane.

06:27.503 --> 06:29.071
Thank you.

06:34.610 --> 06:35.811
There you go, gentlemen.

06:35.845 --> 06:36.912
Thank you.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.950
Whoo!

06:41.984 --> 06:44.119
Beautiful, huh?

06:44.153 --> 06:45.620
What do you think?

06:45.655 --> 06:47.789
Is this beautiful or what?

06:47.824 --> 06:49.124
This is great.

06:49.158 --> 06:50.258
Yeah.

06:51.794 --> 06:54.596
You know what? I love
this look on you.

06:56.332 --> 06:57.599
I look like you.

06:57.633 --> 07:00.035
I know.
Isn't it great?

07:04.240 --> 07:05.207
Hey, Michael.

07:05.241 --> 07:06.208
What?

07:06.242 --> 07:07.175
Smile.

07:07.210 --> 07:08.743
Oh, wait a minute.
Hold on.

07:08.778 --> 07:09.778
Uh, excuse me. Sir.

07:09.812 --> 07:10.812
Would you mind snapping

07:10.847 --> 07:11.880
a picture of us, please?

07:11.914 --> 07:12.914
No worries, mates.
Thanks.

07:12.949 --> 07:14.816
Get the boats in,
all right? Ok.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.051
All right.

07:22.925 --> 07:24.526
That's great.
Thank you.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.595
Hey, wait.
This is, uh...
For you.

07:26.629 --> 07:27.662
Thanks a lot.

07:27.697 --> 07:28.797
Thank you.
Have a good day.

07:28.831 --> 07:29.798
All right.

07:29.832 --> 07:30.832
Can't get better than this, huh?

07:30.867 --> 07:32.167
It's off to paradise island.

07:32.201 --> 07:33.702
Ooh! Sorry, sir.

07:33.736 --> 07:35.137
Wasn't watchin'
where I was goin'.

07:35.171 --> 07:37.005
That's... Ok.
Ok.

07:37.039 --> 07:38.707
No worries...
Cool.

07:38.741 --> 07:39.841
Mate.

07:46.649 --> 07:47.616
You ok?

07:47.650 --> 07:48.984
What? Yeah. Come on.

07:49.018 --> 07:50.085
What's the boat's name?

07:50.119 --> 07:51.159
Oh. You're
gonna love this.

07:51.187 --> 07:52.854
It's call, uh, the <i> Tiffany.</i>

07:52.889 --> 07:54.289
I'm sure it's owned
by the same family

07:54.323 --> 07:55.824
that owns that jewelry store.

07:55.858 --> 07:57.592
Probably just, uh,
charter it out
on the weekend

07:57.627 --> 07:58.960
when they're not using it.

07:58.995 --> 07:59.861
Lucky for us.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.864
But how tacky is that, huh?

08:02.899 --> 08:05.033
Michael: Ok...

08:05.067 --> 08:07.035
Now, you can't miss that.

08:14.944 --> 08:16.411
Oh, yeah.

08:16.479 --> 08:17.846
Come on.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.382
When you said
a few days
on a boat,

08:20.416 --> 08:21.850
I didn't expect this.

08:21.884 --> 08:24.753
Yeah, well...
Have a seat,
my friend.

08:24.787 --> 08:26.354
Lesson number one...

08:26.389 --> 08:29.224
You always get
what you deserve
out of life.

08:35.131 --> 08:36.965
Can I help you, sirs?

08:37.033 --> 08:39.201
Yes. You can.

08:39.235 --> 08:42.537
You can start
by taking those bags
down to our cabins.

08:42.572 --> 08:45.407
And, uh, we just
traveled, like, halfway
around the world, man,

08:45.441 --> 08:47.008
and we're dyin' of thirst,
so how about poppin' open

08:47.043 --> 08:48.577
a couple of sodas
on your way back?

08:48.611 --> 08:50.078
Oh, and, um,
put a couple of those

08:50.112 --> 08:52.714
little umbrellas in it,
'cause... We love those.

08:53.816 --> 08:54.950
I'm sorry, sir.

08:54.984 --> 08:56.351
I think you're
on the wrong craft.

08:56.385 --> 08:59.221
This is a private yacht, sir,

08:59.255 --> 09:00.522
not a charter.

09:00.556 --> 09:03.291
If you could, perhaps,
tell me the name?

09:04.360 --> 09:06.161
This is the <i> Tiffany,</i> isn't it?

09:06.195 --> 09:07.262
No, sir.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.197
The...<i> Tiffany,</i>

09:09.232 --> 09:10.832
I believe, is over there.

09:19.275 --> 09:20.375
That's yours.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.418
G'day, mate.

09:30.453 --> 09:32.153
Hey.
G'day, mate.

09:32.188 --> 09:34.089
They're so friendly here.

09:34.123 --> 09:35.223
Yeah.

09:37.526 --> 09:38.893
Frakes.

09:42.932 --> 09:45.233
Let's see.
Platinum cards...

09:45.268 --> 09:47.402
Beverly hills address.

09:47.436 --> 09:49.404
This kid might
be worth somethin'.

09:49.438 --> 09:51.740
That's what I thought.
Pulled up in a limo.

09:51.774 --> 09:53.575
Heading out to paradise island.

09:53.609 --> 09:55.610
That place isn't cheap.

09:55.645 --> 09:56.911
What's up?

09:59.682 --> 10:01.249
Our next project?

10:04.987 --> 10:06.087
Hold up.

10:13.162 --> 10:14.262
Hello!

10:18.167 --> 10:19.401
Ow!

10:19.435 --> 10:21.069
Hello?

10:21.103 --> 10:23.071
Yeah! What?

10:25.675 --> 10:27.142
Is this the <i> Tiffany?</i>

10:27.176 --> 10:29.844
Yeah. This is her.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.447
Please tell me
there's more than one.

10:32.481 --> 10:35.083
No. No, this is her.

10:35.117 --> 10:36.584
One and only.

10:38.120 --> 10:41.156
All right, I'd like
to talk to the captain
of the boat, please.

10:41.190 --> 10:42.791
That would be me.

10:42.825 --> 10:45.060
Jake hunter's the name.

10:45.094 --> 10:47.829
You're the captain
of this... Heap?

10:47.863 --> 10:49.431
Well...

10:49.465 --> 10:51.099
She might need
a new coat of paint,

10:51.133 --> 10:53.902
but she's as solid
as the first day she
was put on the sea.

10:53.936 --> 10:55.370
And who did that... Noah?

10:55.404 --> 10:57.205
Come on, Michael.

10:57.239 --> 10:58.306
No, no. Tommy,
if this was a horse,

10:58.341 --> 10:59.741
we'd shoot it to put it
out of its misery.

10:59.775 --> 11:01.276
There's no way we're
gettin' on this boat.

11:01.310 --> 11:02.477
I want my money back.

11:02.511 --> 11:06.181
Uh, you have a nonrefundable
deposit, sir.

11:06.215 --> 11:09.084
I'm sure it's something
my attorney can work out.

11:09.118 --> 11:10.752
Come on, Tommy,
we're outta here.

11:10.786 --> 11:12.053
What a scam.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.221
Well, um... Good luck

11:13.255 --> 11:14.989
finding anything else,
Mr. woods.

11:15.024 --> 11:17.926
The charters,
they fill up kinda fast
around here.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.427
And, uh, just so you know...

11:19.462 --> 11:21.763
I'm leaving in an hour
whether you're
on my boat or not.

11:21.797 --> 11:23.898
Yeah, ok. Thanks. Great.
Come on, Tommy.

11:23.933 --> 11:27.001
We're gonna find us
something better.
Come on. Let's go.

11:27.036 --> 11:30.839
Ok. Forward. Aft.
Port is left side.

11:30.873 --> 11:32.040
Starboard is right.

11:32.074 --> 11:35.744
The bathroom is called the head.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.645
The kitchen is the galley,

11:37.680 --> 11:39.881
where you will find a fridge,

11:39.915 --> 11:41.483
and it is
a help-yourself fridge.

11:41.517 --> 11:43.685
Up here is the sky deck.

11:43.719 --> 11:45.653
To my right over here
is the cockpit

11:45.688 --> 11:47.222
where you'll find me
most of the time.

11:47.256 --> 11:49.958
Lower deck is where
we do all the fishing.

11:49.992 --> 11:51.960
Emergency channel is 39.

11:51.994 --> 11:53.862
Life jackets are stowed
in the compartment

11:53.929 --> 11:55.563
that says "life jackets,"

11:55.598 --> 11:59.000
and nobody touches my mug here.

12:00.603 --> 12:03.171
He's not a captain,
he's a warden.

12:06.776 --> 12:08.877
David, listen, man.

12:08.911 --> 12:10.612
When I asked you to ask your dad

12:10.646 --> 12:12.447
if he could get me a job,

12:12.481 --> 12:14.449
I was hoping it
would be more, you know,
executive level.

12:14.483 --> 12:15.417
I don't want to...

12:15.451 --> 12:17.185
No, I don't want
to drive a tour tram.

12:17.219 --> 12:19.421
Ok. All right.

12:19.455 --> 12:20.955
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.857
I'm just gonna
call someone else.

12:22.892 --> 12:25.460
It's fine. Thanks. Bye.

12:25.494 --> 12:26.734
Uh, I think we should settle up

12:26.762 --> 12:28.129
on the other half
of the payment.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.764
I don't want to get too far out.

12:29.799 --> 12:31.933
Are you kidding me?

12:31.967 --> 12:33.768
The way we've been mislead,

12:33.803 --> 12:36.004
we shouldn't pay you at all.

12:36.038 --> 12:38.106
Well...

12:39.175 --> 12:40.909
Ok.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.078
Ok, you know what?

12:44.113 --> 12:46.347
You don't have to play
the missing wallet trick
on me.

12:46.382 --> 12:48.082
Relax, will you?

12:48.117 --> 12:52.654
I probably put it down
in my luxury suite
below deck.

12:55.491 --> 12:56.891
Tommy:
Could you have lost it?

12:56.926 --> 12:58.493
No. No. No.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.762
Because when I paid
the limo driver,

13:00.796 --> 13:02.664
I had my wallet, so...

13:05.468 --> 13:07.068
Oh, no.

13:07.102 --> 13:10.004
Look, it's not my fault
that I got pickpocketed,
all right?

13:10.039 --> 13:11.606
But don't worry.
I'm having the money

13:11.640 --> 13:12.907
transferred to the island,

13:12.942 --> 13:14.609
and I'll pay you
as soon as we get there.

13:14.643 --> 13:16.144
I'm totally good for it.

13:20.382 --> 13:22.050
Give me your watch.

13:22.084 --> 13:23.284
What?

13:23.319 --> 13:24.919
You heard me.
Give me your watch.

13:24.954 --> 13:26.421
I want some kind of collateral.

13:26.455 --> 13:27.689
Are you nuts?

13:27.723 --> 13:29.958
I could buy this boat
with my watch.

13:29.992 --> 13:31.259
You either give me
the watch now,

13:31.293 --> 13:34.329
or I'm takin' both
of you guys back to port.

13:40.135 --> 13:43.037
All right.
All right. Fine.

13:45.441 --> 13:46.774
Take it.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.812
If you put one scratch
on it, I swear...

13:52.815 --> 13:56.651
What are you gonna do,
you gonna call your lawyer?

13:56.685 --> 13:58.152
Michael:
Dad, look, you know what?

13:58.187 --> 13:59.554
I'm gonna lose you
at any minute.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.756
Can you please just
cancel all the credit cards

14:01.790 --> 14:04.292
and wire the money directly
to paradise island for me?

14:04.326 --> 14:06.127
Yeah. All right.

14:06.161 --> 14:07.762
And, dad, I'm gonna pay you back

14:07.796 --> 14:09.531
as soon as I get home.
All right?

14:09.565 --> 14:11.766
Ok. Thank you, dad.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.835
Bye.

14:15.971 --> 14:18.973
Pry sympathy
out of him
with a crowbar.

14:21.443 --> 14:22.911
Well?

14:22.945 --> 14:25.179
You'll get your money
as soon as we get
to the island,

14:25.214 --> 14:26.314
all right?

14:26.348 --> 14:27.415
Good.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.850
You'll get your watch back.

14:29.752 --> 14:31.753
Yeah. Great.

14:31.787 --> 14:35.890
Uh... Who's steering
the boat?

14:35.925 --> 14:37.425
It has an autopilot.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.594
And it works.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.297
Hey, Jake. Think we can
do some fishing, too?

14:42.331 --> 14:45.133
Sure. Why not?

14:46.835 --> 14:48.703
I'm going to get changed.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.876
Who are you,
the crocodile hunter?

14:56.645 --> 15:01.049
Please. I don't think
the crocodile hunter
shops on rodeo drive.

15:04.420 --> 15:05.954
Michael: Yeah, actually,
my, uh, friend Jennifer

15:05.988 --> 15:07.822
told me to give you guys a call.

15:07.856 --> 15:10.425
Yes. She said that,
uh, your management company

15:10.459 --> 15:12.026
was opening up a music division

15:12.061 --> 15:13.861
and needs someone to run it.

15:13.896 --> 15:16.197
Yeah. I... yeah... whoa!

15:16.231 --> 15:17.999
Whoa! No! Uh... what?!

15:18.033 --> 15:20.168
No, no, not... aah... you.

15:20.202 --> 15:21.469
It's just, uh...
It's just... aah!

15:21.503 --> 15:23.137
It's a great job opportunity.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.673
Uh, could you hold on?
I'm so sorry.

15:25.741 --> 15:27.108
I'm experiencing a little
technical difficulty right here.

15:27.142 --> 15:30.278
What?! I'm sorry about that.
Heh heh heh.

15:30.312 --> 15:32.480
So, uh, let's talk music.

15:32.514 --> 15:34.782
Well, I have...
I have a lot... aah! Aah!

15:34.817 --> 15:35.817
Michael.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.452
What?! Oh!

15:37.486 --> 15:39.721
Hello? Could you hold on
just one second?

15:39.755 --> 15:40.822
Hey, Michael.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.358
No, no. Would... hello?
Yeah. I'm sorry.

15:43.392 --> 15:45.693
I'm sorry.
Hold on. Hold on.

15:45.728 --> 15:47.528
No. Yeah. Hold... aah!

15:47.563 --> 15:49.163
Whoa. Hey, Michael.

15:49.198 --> 15:52.000
Aah. Aah. Hello?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.434
Hello?

15:53.469 --> 15:55.570
Hello?

15:55.604 --> 15:58.539
Hello?

15:58.574 --> 15:59.674
Hello?

15:59.708 --> 16:01.309
Michael.

16:06.181 --> 16:07.148
What?!

16:07.182 --> 16:09.217
I was only gonna suggest

16:09.251 --> 16:10.752
that you unplug the headset

16:10.786 --> 16:11.986
and use the phone.

16:17.292 --> 16:19.827
Hey. You guys
should reel in.

16:19.862 --> 16:21.262
We're gonna be hitting
some cross-currents.

16:21.296 --> 16:22.897
Could get some
pretty big swells.

16:22.931 --> 16:24.932
Tommy:
Reel in, Michael.

16:35.678 --> 16:37.245
Wow, huh?

16:37.279 --> 16:39.781
These waves are huge.

16:39.815 --> 16:43.551
Things go up and down
and up and down.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.792
Mike...

16:50.826 --> 16:52.760
You don't look so good.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.368
Yeah.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.405
Want a bite of my egg sandwich?

17:05.441 --> 17:06.907
That's ok.

17:09.044 --> 17:10.511
What happened to your hand?

17:10.546 --> 17:14.682
I just busted open
an old blister.

17:14.717 --> 17:19.186
You should see
if captain Jake has
any bandages for you.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.728
Hey.

17:26.762 --> 17:27.994
Hey.

17:28.030 --> 17:29.831
You have a bandage?

17:29.865 --> 17:33.134
Uh... Uh, yeah.

17:33.168 --> 17:35.536
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

17:35.571 --> 17:38.740
Radio: <i> Tiffany,</i>
this is island patrol.

17:38.774 --> 17:42.944
Yeah. Hey, butch.
What's goin' on?

17:42.978 --> 17:44.278
Don't touch that.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.546
I haven't seen you in a while.

17:45.581 --> 17:46.748
Everything all right?

17:46.782 --> 17:48.082
Yeah, everything's fine.

17:48.117 --> 17:50.685
Wonderin' if you're up
for some lobster diving
tomorrow?

17:50.719 --> 17:52.954
Sorry, butch.
I, uh, I can't.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.722
I have a charter.

17:54.757 --> 17:56.157
You do?

17:56.191 --> 17:57.225
Yeah.

17:57.259 --> 18:00.228
Listen,
I'll talk about it
when I get back.

18:00.262 --> 18:01.596
Over and out.

18:02.998 --> 18:04.265
Friend of yours?

18:06.802 --> 18:10.838
Whoa! What the heck
happened to your hands?

18:10.873 --> 18:12.039
Nothing.

18:13.575 --> 18:15.343
They just get kind of
beat up on the ranch.

18:15.377 --> 18:18.279
Ah, the ranch.

18:18.313 --> 18:19.847
I get it now.

18:19.882 --> 18:22.250
You own your own ranch,
i suppose?

18:22.284 --> 18:23.684
No, not really.

18:23.719 --> 18:25.219
Not anymore.

18:25.254 --> 18:28.656
Couldn't afford it,
so we just run it now.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.993
Have I done something wrong,
because you're sure
acting like it?

18:32.027 --> 18:33.127
No!

18:34.596 --> 18:36.531
I'm just having
a bad day, I guess.

18:36.565 --> 18:39.367
I've had a few of those.

18:41.670 --> 18:43.304
Thanks for the bandage.

18:47.242 --> 18:48.976
No problem.

18:49.878 --> 18:52.113
Hey, Tommy.

18:52.147 --> 18:53.481
It's called a sextant.

18:53.515 --> 18:58.085
Sailors used to use it
to follow the stars
at night.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.521
My dad and I...

19:00.556 --> 19:02.757
Found it while diving
by a wreck.

19:04.626 --> 19:07.128
You and your dad
were treasure hunters?

19:09.264 --> 19:11.065
Yeah, sort of.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.503
Did you ever find anything else?

19:17.472 --> 19:18.806
Yes, we did.

19:18.841 --> 19:20.842
Once...

19:20.876 --> 19:23.744
A long time ago.

19:25.214 --> 19:26.581
Really?

19:26.615 --> 19:27.648
Oh, yeah.

19:27.683 --> 19:30.117
Where?

19:30.152 --> 19:32.086
Well, my dad and I,
we were diving

19:32.120 --> 19:34.722
by this sunken Spanish galleon,

19:34.756 --> 19:35.990
and we came across
this gold coin

19:36.024 --> 19:37.558
tucked between
2 pieces of coral.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.260
I mean, just perfectly
laying there.

19:39.294 --> 19:41.395
When my dad plucked it
out of there,

19:41.430 --> 19:43.397
there were 7 more underneath it.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.299
That must've been so cool.

19:45.334 --> 19:47.568
It was. It was so cool.

19:47.603 --> 19:48.736
Where's your dad now?

19:51.540 --> 19:53.107
He's around.

19:55.677 --> 19:56.878
Wish mine was.

19:58.113 --> 20:00.448
He died a couple years ago.

20:01.350 --> 20:02.917
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:06.521 --> 20:08.589
Hey, you know what?

20:08.624 --> 20:10.091
Come here a second.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.459
Yeah. You got something
behind your ear.

20:11.493 --> 20:12.426
You serious?

20:12.461 --> 20:13.761
Oh, yeah.
Let me get it there.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.397
It's right, uh, right there.

20:16.431 --> 20:18.132
Ohh!

20:18.166 --> 20:19.367
Is that it?

20:19.401 --> 20:20.368
That is it.

20:20.402 --> 20:21.669
I mean, that's one of 'em.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.472
Here. Check it out.

20:25.507 --> 20:27.775
Oh... It's so cool.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.110
Yeah.

20:29.144 --> 20:31.245
Where are the rest of 'em?

20:31.280 --> 20:34.081
My dad and I, we, uh,
invested them.

20:34.116 --> 20:35.816
You know?

20:41.356 --> 20:42.456
Jonas.

20:43.592 --> 20:44.926
You find out his credit limit?

20:44.960 --> 20:46.761
Yep.

20:47.996 --> 20:50.598
It's unlimited.

20:50.632 --> 20:52.466
Jackpot.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.235
So what's the plan
gonna be, boss?

20:54.269 --> 20:55.670
It's quite simple, really...

20:55.704 --> 20:57.405
Pick up the guy, get a ransom,

20:57.439 --> 20:59.307
then feed him to the sharks.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.080
You know, they did some
research on that coin

21:06.114 --> 21:08.616
and found that it was
on a merchant vessel

21:08.650 --> 21:10.017
sunk by pirates.

21:10.052 --> 21:12.453
Pirates?

21:12.487 --> 21:13.788
Yeah.

21:13.822 --> 21:16.157
Is storytelling one of
the perks on this trip.

21:16.191 --> 21:18.125
Got any of those seasick pills?

21:18.160 --> 21:20.761
No, sorry, we're all out.

21:20.796 --> 21:22.463
But if you're gonna hurl,
do it over the side,

21:22.497 --> 21:24.231
and, uh, not into the wind.

21:24.266 --> 21:26.667
Don't worry about it.
There's nothing left.
Trust me.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.303
Hey, Michael.
Look what Jake
and his dad found.

21:29.338 --> 21:30.571
Pretty cool, huh?

21:30.605 --> 21:33.174
They found it in a sunken ship.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.209
That's cool.

21:36.345 --> 21:37.812
So there were really
pirates around here?

21:37.846 --> 21:39.013
Oh, yeah.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.915
They hit these merchant vessels,

21:40.949 --> 21:42.650
hide out in the islands.

21:42.684 --> 21:44.385
Of course, no one
would go after 'em

21:44.419 --> 21:46.854
because of the...
Cannibals.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.189
Cannibals?

21:48.223 --> 21:49.623
There's no cannibals, Tommy.

21:49.658 --> 21:51.759
Headhunters?
People who eat people.

21:51.793 --> 21:53.227
Love to shrink heads.

21:53.261 --> 21:55.196
I gotta go lie down.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.599
He's not doing so well.

21:58.633 --> 22:01.102
What a shame.

22:01.136 --> 22:02.303
Pirates.

22:02.337 --> 22:05.206
You know, they're still around.

22:06.475 --> 22:08.442
Aren't you worried about
them hitting your boat?

22:08.477 --> 22:11.579
No. This isn't exactly

22:11.613 --> 22:14.181
the type of vessel
they're after.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.623
Aah!

22:44.813 --> 22:45.846
Oh, hey, Michael.

22:45.881 --> 22:47.148
Yeah.
You're missin'
all the fun.

22:47.182 --> 22:48.783
Come on. Look
what Jake rigged.

22:48.817 --> 22:50.284
You gotta try it.
It's a blast.

22:50.318 --> 22:51.652
Isn't that nice of him.

22:51.686 --> 22:53.320
What did he do,
get struck by lightning?

22:54.256 --> 22:56.057
What happened to your neck?

23:01.596 --> 23:04.265
Hey. You're awake.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.333
Yeah. Oh, and, um...

23:06.368 --> 23:08.269
Look what I found
down there
in the bathroom...

23:08.303 --> 23:09.703
Seasick patches.

23:09.738 --> 23:11.038
Thought you said
you didn't have any.

23:11.073 --> 23:13.841
Oh, you said pills, not patches.

23:15.010 --> 23:16.744
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry
about that.

23:16.778 --> 23:19.280
Next time I'll be
a little more specific
about it.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.714
Hey, hope you boys
are hungry, huh?

23:20.749 --> 23:22.149
We got fresh fish omelets

23:22.184 --> 23:24.118
and melted cheese for dinner.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.252
Ok.

23:27.689 --> 23:29.390
Yeah!
Careful.

23:44.139 --> 23:47.508
Here. My mom gives me soda
when my stomach's upset.

23:47.542 --> 23:50.144
Oh, thanks, buddy.

23:50.178 --> 23:53.214
I actually feel a little
bit better now, though.

23:55.650 --> 23:59.353
You know, this kind of
reminds me of the ranch.

24:01.790 --> 24:03.257
Yeah?

24:04.426 --> 24:06.427
How's that?

24:06.495 --> 24:08.429
You and me together.

24:11.199 --> 24:14.001
Thanks for this, Michael.

24:15.804 --> 24:17.004
You're welcome, buddy.

24:17.038 --> 24:19.607
I'm glad we could do it.

24:21.643 --> 24:23.144
Cheers, mate.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.556
He seems really lonely.

24:35.590 --> 24:38.592
Yeah, I think the grinch
had more friends
than that kid.

24:43.832 --> 24:45.499
I'm kind of hungry.

24:45.534 --> 24:47.134
You want something to eat?

24:48.537 --> 24:50.538
Nah.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.412
My stomach's been
through a lot today,
you know?

24:52.440 --> 24:54.241
I think
I'm gonna give it
a little break.

24:54.276 --> 24:55.843
You go on, though.

24:55.877 --> 24:58.345
Ok? I'll meet you
up there.

25:00.949 --> 25:01.916
Thanks.

25:01.950 --> 25:03.484
Feel better.

25:15.397 --> 25:18.098
Roxanne. Hi.

25:18.133 --> 25:19.867
It's, um, Michael.

25:19.901 --> 25:22.903
Yeah. Um...

25:22.938 --> 25:24.371
No, honey.

25:24.406 --> 25:25.973
You know what? I don't
think that meeting you

25:26.007 --> 25:27.841
in Australia is gonna work out.

25:32.080 --> 25:33.948
And I am
a workhorse. Uh-huh.

25:33.982 --> 25:36.784
Heh, that's right,
available to you 24-7.

25:36.818 --> 25:38.819
Uh, yeah. Sure.

25:38.853 --> 25:40.521
No, I'll get a résumé
right off to you.

25:40.555 --> 25:42.323
No, I appreciate
the opportunity.

25:42.357 --> 25:43.424
Thank you.

25:43.458 --> 25:44.725
All right. Bye-bye.

25:46.494 --> 25:49.129
What am i
gonna do, Tommy? Huh?

25:49.164 --> 25:50.431
My dad said i have to get a job

25:50.465 --> 25:51.432
before the end of the summer

25:51.466 --> 25:52.433
or he's gonna put me to work

25:52.467 --> 25:53.767
as a file clerk in his office.

25:53.802 --> 25:54.935
Ok.

25:54.970 --> 25:57.271
Anyway, I have 3 weeks left,

25:57.305 --> 25:58.272
one of which...

25:58.306 --> 25:59.940
I'm with you.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.476
Why are you lookin' now
if you had all summer?

26:06.181 --> 26:08.482
You know what?
You are absolutely right.

26:08.516 --> 26:10.551
I left it to the last minute,

26:10.585 --> 26:12.319
and I am trashing
our time together,

26:12.354 --> 26:13.988
so, uh...

26:14.022 --> 26:16.890
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

26:16.925 --> 26:18.959
I want you...

26:18.994 --> 26:21.562
To hold this for me.

26:21.596 --> 26:22.997
Really?
Yeah.

26:23.031 --> 26:24.898
Just take it, all right?
I'm gonna be fine.

26:24.933 --> 26:26.973
I'm not gonna make
any more phone calls
on that thing

26:27.002 --> 26:29.236
until we get home,
all right? I promise.

26:29.271 --> 26:30.771
Deal.
All right.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.606
Tell you what.
I'm gonna go grab
the camera,

26:32.641 --> 26:33.707
take some photos,

26:33.742 --> 26:35.376
you put that
in my suitcase.
All right?

26:35.410 --> 26:36.744
All right.
All right,
buddy.

26:36.778 --> 26:38.045
Oh.

26:38.079 --> 26:40.080
Where is the camera?

26:40.115 --> 26:41.282
In the wheelhouse.

26:41.316 --> 26:42.783
Cool.

26:45.987 --> 26:48.122
Where's the wheelhouse?

26:48.156 --> 26:49.890
Where the wheel is.

26:51.893 --> 26:52.993
Ok.

27:09.210 --> 27:10.711
Oh, no.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.951
Michael:
All right!

27:17.986 --> 27:21.588
So, time to take some photos.

27:21.623 --> 27:23.223
You ready?

27:23.258 --> 27:25.626
Uh, Michael?

27:25.660 --> 27:27.194
Hey, are you ok?

27:27.228 --> 27:29.096
You're not gettin'
sick, are you?

27:29.130 --> 27:31.098
No.
Ok.

27:31.132 --> 27:32.232
All right.

27:32.267 --> 27:34.101
Well, get ready, buddy.

27:37.706 --> 27:41.208
Smile for the camera.
Say cheese.

27:45.780 --> 27:48.682
I can already smell the money.

27:48.717 --> 27:50.984
Get goin'!

28:01.996 --> 28:03.364
Hey.

28:04.632 --> 28:05.899
You need somethin'?

28:05.934 --> 28:08.535
Yeah. I was
wonderin' if, um...

28:08.570 --> 28:10.904
You had any Pellegrino.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.239
What's that?

28:12.273 --> 28:14.441
Water.

28:14.476 --> 28:17.144
You guys got your labels
for everything, don't you?

28:17.178 --> 28:20.280
What's up with you, huh?

28:20.315 --> 28:23.384
You know, for a guy
who's in a service-oriented
business,

28:23.418 --> 28:26.286
you really do have
a serious attitude
problem, you know that?

28:26.321 --> 28:28.188
I bet you don't get many
repeat customers, do you?

28:28.223 --> 28:30.157
The water's in
the galley, Mr. wood.
Help yourself.

28:30.191 --> 28:32.192
I just don't get it.
I came up here

28:32.227 --> 28:33.460
so we could talk...

28:33.495 --> 28:34.461
Shh.

28:34.496 --> 28:36.196
Hey, don't shush me.
All right?

28:36.231 --> 28:39.199
No, just listen.
I hear something.

28:41.002 --> 28:43.337
Michael: What?

28:43.371 --> 28:46.039
Uh, this is not good.

28:46.074 --> 28:48.742
What's... what's going on?
What are you doing?

28:48.777 --> 28:51.512
We're about to be hit
by pirates.

28:51.546 --> 28:52.713
Pirates?!

28:52.747 --> 28:53.847
What...

28:53.882 --> 28:56.750
Island patrol.
This is the <i> Tiffany,</i>
come in.

28:56.785 --> 28:58.252
How do you know they're pirates?

28:58.286 --> 28:59.920
Well, they're comin' up
in an inflatable.

28:59.954 --> 29:01.121
They made no radio call.

29:01.156 --> 29:02.923
I'm sure
they're not coming
for the Pellegrino.

29:02.957 --> 29:04.558
Trust me.

29:04.592 --> 29:05.993
Island patrol.
Mayday! Mayday!

29:06.027 --> 29:07.828
Michael:
What do they what?

29:07.862 --> 29:08.862
Jake: Want me
to stop and ask?

29:08.897 --> 29:11.031
Hey, guys.
What's goin' on?

29:11.065 --> 29:12.032
Pirates.

29:12.066 --> 29:13.734
Pirates?

29:17.772 --> 29:20.340
Uh, they're catchin' up, dude.

29:20.375 --> 29:22.509
Left full throttle, ok?

29:22.544 --> 29:23.911
All right.

29:32.053 --> 29:33.854
Jake: Island patrol,
come in.

29:41.329 --> 29:43.897
We must be out of range.
They're not answering.

29:58.880 --> 29:59.947
Grab the wheel.

30:00.014 --> 30:01.748
Come on.
You stay down.

30:22.537 --> 30:23.704
Whoo!

30:32.313 --> 30:33.413
Hey, wait!

31:00.875 --> 31:03.176
Whoo! Way to go!

31:17.759 --> 31:20.394
Hey, that was good.

31:21.796 --> 31:25.265
So now what?
'Cause we're never
gonna outrun them.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.000
See that island over there?

31:27.035 --> 31:29.102
Yeah.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.804
You're getting off.

31:30.838 --> 31:31.872
Off?

31:31.906 --> 31:32.873
Jake: Yeah,
it's the start

31:32.907 --> 31:34.308
of the belgrass island chain.

31:34.342 --> 31:35.409
I'm gonna try to lose 'em

31:35.443 --> 31:36.743
and come back for you.

31:36.778 --> 31:40.280
No. No. We are not
getting off the boat.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.616
You don't seem to
understand something.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.952
These guys don't take prisoners.

31:44.986 --> 31:46.787
They take what
they want from you

31:46.821 --> 31:48.322
and then throw you
to the sharks.

31:48.356 --> 31:50.891
Now get aft and grab
some life jackets.

31:52.894 --> 31:54.127
Come on. Get aft.

32:07.575 --> 32:09.076
You two are idiots!

32:09.110 --> 32:11.144
Fix that later!
We're losing them!

32:11.179 --> 32:12.379
All right!

32:19.187 --> 32:21.855
All right.
Come on, come on!

32:21.889 --> 32:22.990
When we get around
this point up here,

32:23.024 --> 32:24.024
I want you guys to jump off,

32:24.058 --> 32:25.692
swim to shore,
and find some cover.

32:25.727 --> 32:26.760
Hopefully they won't see you.

32:26.794 --> 32:28.195
You gotta wait for me
until I get back.

32:28.229 --> 32:29.363
All right!

32:29.397 --> 32:30.731
Jake: Ok.

32:32.734 --> 32:34.668
All right, go!

33:21.449 --> 33:22.549
Aah!

33:36.964 --> 33:38.131
Tommy?

33:42.970 --> 33:44.571
Tommy!

33:45.773 --> 33:47.474
Tommy!

33:47.508 --> 33:49.142
Michael!

33:49.177 --> 33:51.211
Tommy?

33:51.245 --> 33:53.280
Over here!

33:57.585 --> 33:59.486
Are you ok?

33:59.520 --> 34:00.754
Yeah.

34:00.788 --> 34:02.189
Where did you go?

34:02.223 --> 34:03.390
I was just lookin' around.

34:03.424 --> 34:05.792
Don't leave my side
again, all right?

34:09.230 --> 34:11.431
What time is it?

34:11.466 --> 34:12.733
You think Jake made it?

34:12.766 --> 34:14.534
I don't know.
Come on.

34:14.569 --> 34:16.402
Hey, you think
those cannibals
Jake was talkin'...

34:16.437 --> 34:18.572
No, no, there aren't
any cannibals.

34:18.606 --> 34:20.607
The pirates were true.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.509
Come on.

34:30.985 --> 34:33.320
What do you reckon?

34:33.353 --> 34:35.054
What do I reckon?

34:35.089 --> 34:36.489
I reckon they
couldn't outrun us,

34:36.524 --> 34:38.558
so they scuttled the boat.

34:38.592 --> 34:40.893
What do you reckon, Jonas?

34:40.928 --> 34:43.929
Do you reckon
they scuttled the boat?

34:43.965 --> 34:46.500
We're gonna search
every single one
of these islands

34:46.534 --> 34:47.967
until we find them.

34:48.002 --> 34:48.969
Is that clear?

34:49.003 --> 34:51.237
He's too big a score.
Is that clear?!

34:53.574 --> 34:55.375
Let's do it.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.588
Tommy: I've never seen
anything like this.

35:08.623 --> 35:09.956
Michael: Yeah.

35:10.858 --> 35:12.459
Not a soul in sight.

35:12.493 --> 35:15.796
You think someone
will come and look for us?

35:18.833 --> 35:19.933
Who?

35:21.402 --> 35:23.537
Your mom? My parents?

35:23.571 --> 35:25.105
They think we're
at a resort for a week

35:25.139 --> 35:26.807
and don't want to be bothered.

35:30.211 --> 35:33.980
We never should have
gotten on Jake's boat
in the first place.

35:34.015 --> 35:36.283
That was the first mistake.

35:36.317 --> 35:39.319
Hey. You can't blame him.

35:39.353 --> 35:41.621
No? Why not?
It's his boat.

35:41.656 --> 35:42.656
He's the captain.

35:42.690 --> 35:44.257
He's the one who
told us to jump off,

35:44.292 --> 35:45.592
that he'd come back for us.

35:45.626 --> 35:47.561
Because blaming someone
doesn't solve anything.

35:47.595 --> 35:49.563
Oh, did Jake tell you that, too?

35:51.532 --> 35:54.000
No.

35:54.035 --> 35:55.802
My dad did.

36:15.223 --> 36:16.723
Hey...

36:21.896 --> 36:24.898
We're gonna be ok.

36:24.932 --> 36:26.433
I promise.

36:32.240 --> 36:34.307
What are we gonna do?

36:40.181 --> 36:42.582
Well...

36:42.617 --> 36:45.619
I told your mom I'd
take care of you, right?

36:45.653 --> 36:48.922
So... That's what
I'm gonna do.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.790
I'm gonna take care of you.

36:53.861 --> 36:55.762
You hungry?

37:31.465 --> 37:34.567
Ok, buddy.
What do you think?

37:34.602 --> 37:36.736
I mean, you know,
it's not the, uh...

37:36.771 --> 37:38.905
It's not the tree house
you built at the ranch,

37:38.940 --> 37:41.074
but it's solid as a rock, and...

37:41.108 --> 37:43.243
It's gonna protect us
if it rains.

37:44.879 --> 37:46.146
Yeah.

37:46.180 --> 37:47.847
Come here.

37:49.050 --> 37:50.550
Look at this view, huh?

37:50.584 --> 37:53.486
You know how much
this view would cost
if we were in Malibu?

38:18.112 --> 38:20.413
Michael: Here we go.
Nice little fishy.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.056
If we get one,

38:30.091 --> 38:31.992
how are we gonna cook it?

38:34.795 --> 38:35.996
You like Sushi, right?

38:36.030 --> 38:37.897
Never had it.

38:37.932 --> 38:40.233
Never? Ah, you're gonna
love it. It's great.

38:40.267 --> 38:42.035
It's real good for you, too.

38:42.069 --> 38:43.870
Very high in protein.

38:47.942 --> 38:49.242
Aah!

38:53.781 --> 38:54.748
What am I doin' wrong?

38:54.782 --> 38:58.084
I don't know...

38:58.119 --> 39:01.087
But I could sure go
for one of mark's steak
sandwiches right now.

39:01.122 --> 39:02.756
Who's mark?

39:04.525 --> 39:06.092
Just some guy my mom likes.

39:06.127 --> 39:08.194
Your mom's seein' someone?

39:08.229 --> 39:09.496
Well, that's cool.

39:12.133 --> 39:13.700
You don't like him, do you?

39:15.770 --> 39:18.204
What difference does it make?

39:18.239 --> 39:21.174
We may never
get off this island.

39:22.176 --> 39:23.410
Come on.

39:25.079 --> 39:26.846
Tommy: You know,
Michael,

39:26.881 --> 39:29.149
I was reading in Australia...

39:29.183 --> 39:31.718
They have these snakes
called one steps.

39:31.752 --> 39:34.621
They bite you,
and one step later,
you're dead.

39:34.655 --> 39:35.955
Yeah?

39:35.990 --> 39:39.025
They've also got spiders
that can jump 10 feet,

39:39.060 --> 39:40.527
and saltwater crocodiles.

39:40.561 --> 39:42.729
The locals call 'em
man-eaters.

39:42.763 --> 39:44.264
Tommy, you couldn't have read up

39:44.298 --> 39:45.899
on edible plant life
or something?

39:51.238 --> 39:52.439
Look!

39:52.473 --> 39:55.241
Bananas. Come on.

39:55.276 --> 39:56.943
Ok, I'm gonna hoist you up.

39:56.977 --> 39:58.912
Ready? 1, 2, 3.

40:00.614 --> 40:02.549
Get it, now.
Grab 'em.

40:04.418 --> 40:05.952
Both: Aah!

40:05.986 --> 40:07.587
Oh!

40:12.827 --> 40:14.194
Both: Aah! Unh!

40:15.629 --> 40:17.964
Ow! Ow!

40:17.998 --> 40:20.667
Oh, come here.
You ok?

40:20.701 --> 40:22.202
Yeah.
You all right?

40:22.236 --> 40:24.404
Yeah.
Get up. Get up.

40:24.438 --> 40:27.607
What... Was that?!

40:27.641 --> 40:29.542
I don't know.

40:32.213 --> 40:33.780
What's that?
What?

40:37.852 --> 40:40.820
I don't know.
Stay behind me.

40:50.931 --> 40:55.435
I think these mean
someone else was here...

40:55.469 --> 40:57.504
Hundreds of years ago, I'm sure.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.272
Are you sure?

40:59.306 --> 41:01.307
Yeah.

41:01.342 --> 41:03.143
Be careful.

41:09.884 --> 41:13.253
You know,
we might just want
to stay in here, Tommy.

41:13.287 --> 41:15.522
Tommy: Really?

41:15.556 --> 41:18.525
Yeah.

41:18.559 --> 41:22.262
I mean, it's...
It's dry and...

41:24.064 --> 41:25.932
It seems pretty safe.

41:27.368 --> 41:29.169
Whoa!

41:30.838 --> 41:31.871
Can you help me out, please?

41:31.906 --> 41:32.839
Whoa, whoa.

41:32.873 --> 41:34.374
Hold on!
I am.

41:35.543 --> 41:37.577
Aah... Oh!

41:37.611 --> 41:39.012
Ok, ok.

41:39.046 --> 41:40.380
All right. I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

41:40.414 --> 41:42.148
I got it. I got it.
I got it. Ow!

41:53.027 --> 41:54.427
Are you all right?

41:54.461 --> 41:56.729
I'm fine. Let's go.

41:58.065 --> 41:59.365
Oh.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.367
How long do you think
those shrunken heads
have been there?

42:01.402 --> 42:03.203
I'm not an
anthropologist, Tommy.
How would I know that?

42:03.237 --> 42:04.477
Well, Jake said
cannibals like...

42:04.505 --> 42:05.438
Shh.

42:05.472 --> 42:06.973
What is it?

42:08.609 --> 42:10.710
I don't know.

42:16.350 --> 42:18.184
Where's that coming from?

42:18.219 --> 42:21.054
I can't tell, all right?
Just stay behind me.

42:22.556 --> 42:24.257
I don't want anyone
to shrink my head, Michael.

42:24.291 --> 42:25.858
That was hundreds of years ago.

42:25.893 --> 42:27.327
Nobody shrinks heads anymore.

42:31.465 --> 42:32.765
All right.
All right.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.434
We're gonna get outta here, ok?

42:34.468 --> 42:38.404
Slowly and quietly, you got it?

42:39.740 --> 42:42.675
Let's go. Let's go.
Go, go, go, go, go.

42:42.710 --> 42:45.845
Come on. Don't look back.
Just keep on movin'. Go.

42:47.114 --> 42:48.648
Come on. Move it.
Hah!

42:48.682 --> 42:50.416
Aah!

42:54.555 --> 42:58.958
You... you think...
you think
this is funny?

42:58.993 --> 43:00.493
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

43:00.527 --> 43:01.828
You're ok.

43:01.862 --> 43:03.529
Yeah, I'm ok.
How you guys doin'?

43:03.564 --> 43:05.431
Yeah, well,
that wasn't cool,
you know?

43:05.466 --> 43:08.635
You almost scared
this kid half
to death here.

43:08.669 --> 43:10.570
Yeah, I can see that.

43:10.604 --> 43:13.573
I'm really sorry about that.

43:13.607 --> 43:15.074
You know, I thought
i told you guys

43:15.109 --> 43:16.843
to stay put on the beach.

43:16.877 --> 43:17.844
Where the heck are we?

43:17.878 --> 43:19.112
Uh, we did, ok,

43:19.146 --> 43:20.980
but then we needed
a few things...

43:21.015 --> 43:23.383
Like food and shelter.

43:23.417 --> 43:25.551
Michael built a shelter
on the beach over there.

43:25.586 --> 43:27.520
Oh, on the north side?
Yeah.

43:27.554 --> 43:28.921
Oh, man, that's where
the wind comes in.

43:28.956 --> 43:31.691
Yeah, we know.
It got blown to bits.

43:33.827 --> 43:35.928
Hey! This is my shirt.

43:35.963 --> 43:37.030
Oh, yeah, yeah.

43:37.064 --> 43:39.265
Yeah, it is.

43:39.300 --> 43:42.235
I, uh, found it
in your suitcase
that washed up.

43:42.269 --> 43:44.937
This is a $400 shirt.

43:44.972 --> 43:47.707
You... you... you just tore
the sleeves off it?

43:47.741 --> 43:50.777
Yeah...

43:50.811 --> 43:53.046
Guess it's only worth
200 now, huh?

43:53.080 --> 43:55.048
Tommy: Wait a minute.
It washed up?
Yeah.

43:55.082 --> 43:56.816
Where's the boat?

43:56.850 --> 43:58.785
I had to scuttle her.

43:58.819 --> 44:01.854
S-scuttle it? What...
What does that mean?

44:01.889 --> 44:03.990
I, uh, I sank her, guys.

44:05.225 --> 44:06.993
You sank our boat?

44:07.027 --> 44:08.561
Yeah. I couldn't
lose 'em.

44:08.595 --> 44:09.729
Had to do somethin'.

44:09.763 --> 44:13.366
W-w-what are
we gonna do now?

44:13.400 --> 44:14.534
Tommy: Yeah, Jake,
i mean...

44:14.568 --> 44:16.736
What happens now?

44:16.770 --> 44:18.071
All right.
Back off, ok?

44:18.105 --> 44:19.105
I'm building a raft.

44:19.139 --> 44:20.073
Oh, my...

44:20.107 --> 44:21.808
I figure we'll lie
low for a while,

44:21.842 --> 44:22.875
give the pirates enough time

44:22.910 --> 44:24.243
to move on and forget about us,

44:24.278 --> 44:26.079
ok, and then
we'll get in
a freighter Lane.

44:26.113 --> 44:27.613
Someone might see us.

44:27.648 --> 44:29.315
It's a good plan.

44:29.350 --> 44:32.318
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

44:32.353 --> 44:33.653
We don't need a raft.

44:33.687 --> 44:34.687
Oh, are we gonna swim back?

44:34.722 --> 44:35.655
No, no, no, no.

44:35.689 --> 44:36.889
You found my suitcase, right?

44:36.924 --> 44:37.857
Jake: Yeah.

44:37.891 --> 44:39.058
Well... well... well,
Tommy...

44:39.093 --> 44:40.827
Tommy put my cell phone
in my suitcase.

44:40.861 --> 44:42.428
It... it... it's got
a satellite hookup.

44:42.463 --> 44:44.797
You can get service
anywhere. We're saved.

44:44.832 --> 44:46.366
Uh, Michael...
Michael: Where is it?

44:46.400 --> 44:47.333
Jake: You know,
it's at camp,

44:47.368 --> 44:49.335
and i... i... i didn't see
a cell phone.

44:49.370 --> 44:51.571
No, no, no. That's probably
'cause he put it in one
of the zipper compartments.

44:51.605 --> 44:54.073
Which zipper compartment
did you put it in, Tommy?

44:58.278 --> 44:59.712
Your phone fell overboard.

44:59.747 --> 45:01.381
Oh, boy.

45:01.415 --> 45:05.251
What?

45:05.285 --> 45:06.953
No.

45:06.987 --> 45:08.287
Look, I'm sorry, ok?
It was an accident.

45:08.322 --> 45:09.455
It fell out of my pocket
into the ocean

45:09.490 --> 45:10.790
when I hooked
this really big fish.

45:10.824 --> 45:14.994
Ok. All right. Great.

45:15.028 --> 45:18.231
Great. That's...
that's... that's just...
that's just great.

45:18.265 --> 45:20.666
Now we may never
get off this island.

45:20.701 --> 45:23.636
Hey, I said I was sorry,
all right?
It was an accident.

45:23.670 --> 45:26.539
Oh... oh... oh...
I'm sorry, Tommy.

45:26.573 --> 45:27.774
I thought you could handle it.

45:27.808 --> 45:28.875
I mean, come on, man.

45:28.909 --> 45:30.910
I told you to take
the phone from me

45:30.944 --> 45:32.245
and put it
in the suitcase.
How hard is that?

45:32.279 --> 45:33.446
Jake: You know what?
Just relax, man.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.214
We're comin' apart
here, man.
Lighten up.

45:35.249 --> 45:39.585
Don't... don't you
tell me to lighten up,
captain kangaroo,

45:39.620 --> 45:40.887
all right, because if your boat,

45:40.921 --> 45:43.489
if that's what
you want to call it,
had a decent motor,

45:43.524 --> 45:45.491
the pirates wouldn't have
caught up to us, all right?

45:45.526 --> 45:46.993
We wouldn't have had
to scuttle it,

45:47.027 --> 45:49.095
and we wouldn't be
in this predicament
right now!

45:51.165 --> 45:52.565
Hey, you know what, woods?

45:52.599 --> 45:54.967
If you want to
blame somebody,
blame yourself,

45:55.002 --> 45:56.102
'cause it wasn't me or my boat

45:56.136 --> 45:57.336
that got us
into this trouble,
all right?

45:57.371 --> 45:58.971
It sure as heck
wasn't little
Tommy over there.

45:59.006 --> 46:01.007
No, it was you, man, you know?

46:01.041 --> 46:02.074
You're just a rich guy

46:02.109 --> 46:03.443
with your labels out
for everyone to see.

46:03.477 --> 46:04.744
You're a great big beacon.

46:04.778 --> 46:05.778
Gimme a break.
You know what?

46:05.813 --> 46:07.346
If we get off this island,

46:07.381 --> 46:09.048
I'm gonna sue you
for negligence.

46:09.082 --> 46:11.250
Oh! Oh, you know what?
That's fine.

46:11.285 --> 46:13.853
But until then,
I'm the captain,
and I'm in charge.

46:13.887 --> 46:15.154
Ha! I don't think so.

46:15.189 --> 46:17.023
You know what?
You go back wherever
you came from.

46:17.057 --> 46:19.425
Just so you know,
i got food, water,

46:19.460 --> 46:21.627
and shelter
that can stand up
against the wind.

46:21.662 --> 46:23.095
Yeah, that's fine with us.

46:23.130 --> 46:24.797
Come on, Tommy.

46:24.832 --> 46:26.566
Michael: Come on.

46:28.469 --> 46:30.136
Tommy, listen to me.

46:30.170 --> 46:32.371
I promised aunt Jules
i would take care
of you,

46:32.406 --> 46:33.439
and that's what I'm gonna do.

46:33.474 --> 46:35.775
I'm gonna
take care of you.
Now, come on.

46:41.014 --> 46:42.448
Come with us.

46:43.450 --> 46:45.518
You can't eat any more coconuts.

46:45.552 --> 46:50.189
Ok. Yeah, ok.
All right.

46:50.224 --> 46:52.492
I see what's goin' on here.

46:52.526 --> 46:54.927
You think you're gonna be
better off with this kid?

46:54.962 --> 46:57.864
Fine. Good luck.

46:57.898 --> 46:58.998
You know, if you
want to join us,

46:59.032 --> 47:00.199
we'll be on
the other side
of the island

47:00.234 --> 47:01.334
right past the cove.

47:01.368 --> 47:02.702
Michael.
Don't worry about it.

47:02.736 --> 47:05.104
You know what?
You're gonna have
to learn to trust me.

47:05.138 --> 47:06.672
Whatever.

47:06.707 --> 47:07.807
Hey, Michael!

47:09.610 --> 47:11.944
Ah, you know what?

47:11.979 --> 47:14.313
He'll turn up.

47:14.348 --> 47:16.549
He's stubborn,
but he's not
that stubborn.

47:23.590 --> 47:24.790
Your camp's incredible.

47:27.961 --> 47:29.929
Ah.

47:29.963 --> 47:31.497
Michael doesn't know
what he's missing.

47:31.532 --> 47:33.699
Yeah, he wouldn't
drink it, anyway.

47:33.734 --> 47:36.402
It's not Pellegrino.

47:36.436 --> 47:38.170
I've been pretty much
combing the beaches

47:38.205 --> 47:39.572
looking for anything
i could find

47:39.606 --> 47:40.673
that's washed up from my boat.

47:40.707 --> 47:42.842
There.
That's a lot
of stuff.

47:44.745 --> 47:48.347
Yep. It sure is.

47:48.382 --> 47:50.149
This ok to eat?

48:01.762 --> 48:02.995
Ooh!

48:36.763 --> 48:38.965
Why'd you do this to me, Tommy?!

48:57.718 --> 49:00.920
Hello. Hello.

49:13.767 --> 49:15.034
Hi.

49:18.005 --> 49:20.740
You're that, uh, supermodel.

49:20.774 --> 49:22.541
Heather hitt.

49:22.576 --> 49:24.076
That's me.

49:24.111 --> 49:25.311
I don't believe it.

49:25.345 --> 49:27.146
We're... we're saved.

49:27.180 --> 49:29.115
What are you doing here?

49:29.149 --> 49:31.550
I'm shooting an ad on a yacht

49:31.585 --> 49:32.985
around the point up there.

49:33.020 --> 49:34.887
I was just out for a jog.

49:34.921 --> 49:36.355
How about you?

49:36.390 --> 49:38.524
I'm shipwrecked...

49:38.558 --> 49:40.159
Or at least I was.

49:40.193 --> 49:42.862
This is so amazing.

49:42.896 --> 49:44.397
I thought I was gonna be
stranded here on this island

49:44.431 --> 49:46.999
with 2 other guys
for the rest of my life.

49:47.034 --> 49:50.202
Are they as handsome as you?

49:52.873 --> 49:54.306
Well...

49:55.509 --> 49:56.909
No, but...

49:56.943 --> 49:58.077
That doesn't matter, right?

49:58.111 --> 49:59.578
I mean, you're still
gonna help us out?

49:59.613 --> 50:01.347
Yes, of course.

50:02.983 --> 50:04.784
You poor thing.

50:04.818 --> 50:07.319
Shipwrecked.

50:07.354 --> 50:10.890
Thinking you'd be
living here the rest
of your life.

50:10.924 --> 50:13.059
Well, now, if it was with you,

50:13.093 --> 50:14.960
it might be a different story.

50:14.995 --> 50:16.696
You are so cute.

50:16.730 --> 50:18.864
Are you single?

50:18.899 --> 50:21.367
Very. Yes.

50:21.401 --> 50:23.135
I have to ask you...

50:24.237 --> 50:26.338
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

50:26.373 --> 50:27.640
I do now.

50:36.116 --> 50:37.883
Unh!

50:42.422 --> 50:44.990
Aah!

50:52.833 --> 50:54.967
Ah. Oh.

50:57.104 --> 50:59.505
More lobster?

50:59.539 --> 51:01.907
No, thanks.
I'm stuffed.

51:01.942 --> 51:03.542
Couldn't eat another bite.

51:08.749 --> 51:10.916
You know...

51:10.951 --> 51:14.587
My mom would have
loved this place.

51:14.621 --> 51:15.755
She always wanted to come

51:15.789 --> 51:17.556
to someplace tropical.

51:17.591 --> 51:20.226
Why hasn't she?

51:20.260 --> 51:21.827
She's been to Florida.

51:26.166 --> 51:28.768
You know, I don't even
remember my mom.

51:28.802 --> 51:31.203
My parents got divorced
when I was pretty young.

51:31.238 --> 51:35.241
That's when my dad and i
came down here from Seattle.

51:35.275 --> 51:36.976
So your dad never got remarried?

51:37.010 --> 51:38.410
No.

51:41.014 --> 51:43.382
So what about you?

51:43.416 --> 51:45.251
What's your story?

51:45.285 --> 51:48.487
Your mom never wanted
to get remarried?

51:48.522 --> 51:50.422
I don't know.

51:51.925 --> 51:53.893
She likes this guy now, though.

51:53.927 --> 51:56.662
His name's mark.

51:56.696 --> 52:00.132
Do you want to
hold this right here?

52:00.167 --> 52:01.834
Just right there.

52:01.868 --> 52:04.970
So, um...

52:05.005 --> 52:06.205
You like him?

52:06.239 --> 52:07.673
He's not my dad.

52:07.707 --> 52:10.409
Is he trying to be?

52:10.443 --> 52:14.046
I haven't
really given him
much of a chance.

52:22.122 --> 52:24.156
My dad died a year
and a half ago, Tommy.

52:24.191 --> 52:26.759
And the coins,
we didn't invest them.

52:26.793 --> 52:29.428
Had to use 'em
to keep the boat afloat.

52:36.503 --> 52:39.104
It's ok if you
don't want to tell me
about your dad.

52:39.139 --> 52:41.307
I know how it feels.

52:42.676 --> 52:45.544
It's a hard thing to say.

52:47.214 --> 52:50.983
Sometimes, when I'm on the boat,

52:51.017 --> 52:52.785
I feel like i can hear him.

52:52.819 --> 52:56.288
And just for that split second,

52:56.323 --> 52:58.257
I want to answer him back.

52:58.291 --> 53:01.827
I... i know it sounds
really weird.

53:01.862 --> 53:05.631
No, it's not.

53:05.665 --> 53:09.168
See, my dad and i
built this bench
on our property

53:09.202 --> 53:10.870
where we used to go every day

53:10.904 --> 53:14.039
and watch a herd
of wild horses
after chores.

53:15.275 --> 53:17.243
That's where i hear him.

53:18.678 --> 53:20.980
Maybe it's the same
with you and your boat.

53:23.016 --> 53:24.116
Yeah.

53:25.819 --> 53:27.253
Not anymore.

53:36.396 --> 53:37.329
Anything?

53:37.364 --> 53:38.330
Not even a footprint.

53:38.365 --> 53:39.365
There are some footprints.

53:39.399 --> 53:40.399
They were ours.

53:40.433 --> 53:42.534
Right.
Get on the boat.

53:46.973 --> 53:48.674
There it is.

53:48.708 --> 53:50.242
Tommy: That's not bad.

53:50.277 --> 53:53.312
And, uh,
out there by the reef
is an underwater cave.

53:53.346 --> 53:55.948
That's where
i caught the lobster.

53:55.982 --> 53:59.518
When can we look for Michael?

53:59.552 --> 54:02.221
Oh, Michael, yeah.
Next year ok?

54:03.790 --> 54:05.224
How about after lunch?

54:06.793 --> 54:09.194
I hope he's all right.

54:09.229 --> 54:12.264
Listen, your cousin
might be arrogant,

54:12.299 --> 54:15.768
self-centered,
conceited, snobby,

54:15.802 --> 54:18.604
but he's not stupid.

54:18.638 --> 54:21.440
He's gonna be all right.

54:21.474 --> 54:22.775
Aah!

54:36.289 --> 54:37.323
Guys?

54:44.064 --> 54:45.931
Tommy?

54:48.668 --> 54:52.004
I knew you guys would
be checkin' up on me.

54:52.038 --> 54:54.907
Guys. Come on out here.

54:56.242 --> 54:58.077
Let's just talk it out, ok?

55:02.649 --> 55:03.749
Guys?

55:07.620 --> 55:09.488
Guys.

55:13.493 --> 55:17.096
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

55:46.893 --> 55:48.127
You found your bag.

55:48.161 --> 55:50.329
Yeah.

55:52.198 --> 55:53.766
Aw, yeah.

55:56.436 --> 56:00.239
Oh. This stuff
is perfect
for the sail.

56:08.314 --> 56:09.381
What's that?

56:09.416 --> 56:12.718
My mom must have put it in here.

56:14.220 --> 56:15.954
It's from mark.

56:17.257 --> 56:19.291
Well, are you gonna open it?

56:25.632 --> 56:26.899
It's a little wet.

56:26.933 --> 56:28.467
Yeah, it is wet.

56:34.908 --> 56:36.241
Jake: Is that him?

56:36.276 --> 56:38.444
Tommy: It's my dad and i
on that bench.

56:40.213 --> 56:42.815
Hey, you know...

56:42.849 --> 56:44.416
This is a really cool frame.

56:44.451 --> 56:46.952
I bet you
mark carved it himself.

56:46.986 --> 56:49.221
He likes working with wood.

56:51.324 --> 56:53.325
It looks like
it took him some time.

56:53.359 --> 56:56.528
Yeah.

56:59.799 --> 57:02.968
What do you say
we go spear fishing
and catch our lunch?

57:05.238 --> 57:06.905
Ok.

57:07.974 --> 57:10.109
Come on. Let's go.

57:13.179 --> 57:14.379
Thanks.

57:14.414 --> 57:15.581
Sure.

57:17.517 --> 57:19.351
Want this cushion?
Jake: Yeah.

57:20.954 --> 57:22.554
Hey, hey, stop...
Stop... stop... stop.

57:22.589 --> 57:24.389
Don't move.
Don't move.

57:24.424 --> 57:26.658
Be very patient.
They'll come to you.

57:32.031 --> 57:36.568
Jake: Just be patient,
and they'll come to you.
Here they come.

57:38.138 --> 57:40.806
Stop moving.

57:40.840 --> 57:42.841
Look, they can feel
the vibrations.

57:42.876 --> 57:45.410
It spooks 'em,
so look,
just stay still.

57:45.445 --> 57:48.514
See this one over here?
It's comin' right to me.

57:53.653 --> 57:55.454
Aah!

57:55.488 --> 57:57.990
See?
That easy. Whoo!

57:58.024 --> 57:59.324
How'd you do that?

57:59.359 --> 58:00.659
What do I do?

58:04.197 --> 58:05.464
Go down like this.

58:07.700 --> 58:08.700
Hey! I got him!

58:08.735 --> 58:10.169
Yeah!
I got him!

58:10.203 --> 58:13.038
Yeah!

58:13.072 --> 58:17.209
Jake:
It's that easy.

58:20.146 --> 58:22.714
Guys! Guys!

58:26.019 --> 58:27.019
Hey, Jake.

58:27.053 --> 58:30.322
Get out of the water!
Get out of the water!

58:30.356 --> 58:32.691
Hey!

58:32.725 --> 58:34.193
How you doin'?

58:36.229 --> 58:37.529
Get out of the water!

58:37.564 --> 58:39.698
Yeah, sure.
Good.

58:39.732 --> 58:41.033
Yeah. Here comes
the payback.

58:41.067 --> 58:42.634
Get out of the water!

58:45.338 --> 58:46.672
Michael: Get out
of the water!

58:46.706 --> 58:49.608
Tommy! Jake! Crocodile!

58:49.642 --> 58:52.144
Crocodile! Come on!
Get out of that water!

58:52.178 --> 58:55.314
Tommy: Michael!
Michael: Come on!

58:57.383 --> 58:59.384
Come here! Come here!
Come here! Come on, Tommy!

58:59.419 --> 59:01.820
Come here! Come on, buddy!

59:09.062 --> 59:10.829
Swim! Come here!
Come on.

59:10.863 --> 59:12.497
Ah! Aah!

59:24.277 --> 59:25.711
Did you see
the size of that thing?

59:25.745 --> 59:27.546
It must have been,
like, 20 feet long.

59:29.449 --> 59:30.616
And you just nailed it, Jake.

59:30.650 --> 59:32.417
That was awesome.

59:32.452 --> 59:34.753
I don't know how awesome
it would have been

59:34.787 --> 59:37.789
if Michael hadn't
seen it comin' first.

59:39.392 --> 59:40.359
Thanks.

59:40.393 --> 59:42.494
Sure.

59:50.403 --> 59:51.436
You comin' with us?

59:51.471 --> 59:54.439
Is that an invite?

59:54.474 --> 59:56.842
Wasn't that why you came back?

59:58.344 --> 01:00:00.545
Michael, we had fresh lobster,

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:03.682
fruit, tons of water,
and stayed totally dry.

01:00:03.716 --> 01:00:05.784
You're coming with us.

01:00:08.054 --> 01:00:10.222
If it's ok with the captain.

01:00:12.091 --> 01:00:13.191
Yes.

01:00:19.165 --> 01:00:20.799
Hey.

01:00:20.833 --> 01:00:22.901
I just want to tell you

01:00:22.935 --> 01:00:24.069
I'm sorry about the phone thing.

01:00:24.103 --> 01:00:26.605
I overreacted, ok?
It wasn't
your fault.

01:00:26.639 --> 01:00:28.807
There's nobody
I'd rather be
shipwrecked with.

01:00:28.841 --> 01:00:31.977
All right?

01:00:32.011 --> 01:00:33.378
Well...

01:00:33.413 --> 01:00:35.113
Except maybe Heather hitt.

01:00:35.148 --> 01:00:37.015
It's ok.
All right. Come on.

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.154
Who's Heather hitt?

01:00:47.527 --> 01:00:50.195
Here we are.

01:00:50.229 --> 01:00:52.164
Home sweet home.

01:00:58.271 --> 01:01:00.539
Whoa! Ho ho!

01:01:00.573 --> 01:01:02.974
Oh, my... my clothes!

01:01:03.009 --> 01:01:05.477
Aah!
My clean clothes!

01:01:05.511 --> 01:01:08.213
Ah ha ha ha! Hello!

01:01:08.247 --> 01:01:12.150
Oh, these clothes
smell good. Mmm. Ha!

01:01:13.286 --> 01:01:14.619
Jake: Hey,
don't touch that, ok?

01:01:14.654 --> 01:01:16.021
We only have one of 'em.

01:01:16.055 --> 01:01:18.690
Hoo-hoo! Yes!

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:22.928
Jonas: We've probably
checked out
100 islands, frakes.

01:01:22.962 --> 01:01:24.596
We're not gonna find them.

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:26.798
Frakes: You can quit
anytime you want.

01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:28.834
Dante: Nothin' like a bit
of island hopping.

01:01:28.868 --> 01:01:30.402
Shut up.

01:01:44.584 --> 01:01:46.785
I never understood

01:01:46.819 --> 01:01:48.920
why gilligan...

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:51.156
Didn't hit on ginger
or Mary Ann.

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:53.792
You know what I'm sayin'?
I mean,

01:01:53.826 --> 01:01:58.430
Mrs. howe, you know,
i... i totally get that, but...

01:02:00.566 --> 01:02:02.601
Are you ok?

01:02:06.372 --> 01:02:09.441
If no one finds us...

01:02:09.475 --> 01:02:13.078
It's gonna be
really hard on my mom.

01:02:13.112 --> 01:02:15.147
I hope she knows
how much I love her.

01:02:15.181 --> 01:02:16.748
And how much i like mark.

01:02:16.783 --> 01:02:19.818
How come you never told her
how you really felt?

01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:24.189
'Cause I felt guilty.

01:02:24.223 --> 01:02:26.191
Tommy.
Tommy: I do.

01:02:26.225 --> 01:02:28.193
I don't ever want to
forget my dad, Michael.

01:02:28.227 --> 01:02:30.162
Michael:
You're never going to.

01:02:30.196 --> 01:02:34.232
You like mark
for the same reasons
your mom does.

01:02:34.267 --> 01:02:36.168
I'm sure he's a great guy,

01:02:36.202 --> 01:02:41.273
and your dad was
a great guy, Tommy...

01:02:41.307 --> 01:02:43.909
But nobody is ever gonna
take the place of your dad.

01:02:43.943 --> 01:02:47.212
Don't you punish yourself, ok?

01:02:47.246 --> 01:02:49.681
He wouldn't want you to.

01:02:53.486 --> 01:02:54.753
Come here.

01:03:04.997 --> 01:03:07.966
I promise you something.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.405
We are getting off
this island... Ok?

01:03:16.442 --> 01:03:18.410
We have to...

01:03:18.444 --> 01:03:21.446
'Cause I still
gotta get a job
when we get home.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.374
You guys know how to sew?

01:03:40.082 --> 01:03:43.818
I'll tell ya,
that is one expensive sail.

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:47.656
Now all we need
is a mast and a rudder.
Come on, guys.

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:57.599
So...

01:03:57.633 --> 01:04:00.001
You know, there's
only about, uh,

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:02.037
4,000 trees on this island.

01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:04.639
We had to climb
to the top of
mount Everest here

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.241
to find the perfect one?

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:07.342
I told ya.

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:09.444
We need one that stood up
against the elements.

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:11.513
Makes 'em hard
and sturdy up here, boy.

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:13.448
This one's been through a lot.

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:15.717
And now we're gonna
have to carry it

01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:17.252
all the way back
down to the beach.

01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:23.091
Jake: We could
swim it back.

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:29.164
Yeah, right.

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.332
Aw, come on.

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:31.866
It's less than 100 feet.

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:34.302
People jump from heights
way taller than that.

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:35.870
I think that's true, Michael.

01:04:37.406 --> 01:04:40.408
All right. Well,
let's see you
do it, then.

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:42.744
Well, sure, but you're
gonna have to go first.

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:45.480
Huh. And why is that?

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:46.781
'Cause I don't think
you'll do it,

01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:49.351
and I'm not about to climb
all the way back up here

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:52.454
just to grab the mast
and carry it
all the way back down.

01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:55.924
Let's just forget
about it, guys.

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:57.025
I'll do it.

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:59.160
So do it.

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:01.196
Trust me.

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:06.835
No, I'm not gonna do it...

01:05:06.869 --> 01:05:08.603
'Cause I got nothing
to prove to you.

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:10.272
And I'm not letting
Tommy do it, either.

01:05:10.306 --> 01:05:11.439
Sure.

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:13.742
Ok, well, let's go.

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:16.578

Yeah. I do. Yeah.

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:21.543
It's a plane!

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:22.544
It's a plane.

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:24.279
It's a plane!
Hey!

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:25.380
Hey, hey!

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:27.449
Hey! The flare!

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.117
Hurry, Michael, go!

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:30.618
Go. Hey!

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:32.620
It's a plane!
Hey! Down here!

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:33.955
Down here! Hey!

01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:35.256
What's going on?

01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:36.958
There's a plane. Hey!

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:38.560
They can't see us here.

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:40.362
What?

01:06:40.396 --> 01:06:42.897
They can't see us.

01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:58.480
Look!

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.015
Bull's-eye.

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:03.685
Too easy.

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:09.224
Whoo!

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:10.492
No!

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:11.760
What are you doing?

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:14.629
Oh, no! You idiot!

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:17.298
It's a commercial jet
flying at 35,000 feet!

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:20.702
Oh, we needed that for
when we went out to sea.

01:07:20.736 --> 01:07:21.903
Maybe a freighter
would have seen it.

01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:25.607
Now, it'll just be
blind luck if
somebody sees us.

01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:27.809
Well, maybe you should
have put the flare manual
out on the reading table...

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:29.978
Don't blame me
for your ignorance!

01:07:30.012 --> 01:07:31.212
You know, he was
just trying to help.

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.314
No, no, you know what?
This guy's pathetic.

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:35.016
All right? Pathetic.
He knows nothing

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:36.451
about anything.

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:38.553
I mean, you want to wear
a captain's hat?

01:07:38.587 --> 01:07:40.588
First, learn how to run a boat.

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:42.924
Top to bottom, inside and out,

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:44.592
everything about it.
You have to work for it...

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:46.094
Hard.

01:07:46.128 --> 01:07:48.530
You know, this is just
great coming from a guy

01:07:48.564 --> 01:07:49.564
who sank his own boat.

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:50.799
You know what? Stop it.

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:52.167
That boat is full
of sweat and memories

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:53.735
that I've worked for
my entire life.

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:56.504
What have you ever worked for?

01:07:56.539 --> 01:07:58.139
Come on, Michael, tell me.

01:07:58.174 --> 01:07:59.340
What have you ever worked for?

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:00.308
Come on, Jake.

01:08:00.342 --> 01:08:02.777
Stop it.
Tell me, Michael.

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:08.016
That's just what I thought.

01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:11.186
Michael: You're right.

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:12.620
I've never worked for anything.

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:15.089
Is that what you want to hear?

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:16.825
I'm 23 years old,

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.426
and I don't know
what I'm good at.

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:20.528
I wish I was more
like you two guys.

01:08:20.563 --> 01:08:22.529
You know, the way Tommy
is with his ranch,

01:08:22.564 --> 01:08:24.532
and you are with your boat.

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:26.401
You both have found something.

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:29.970
I never had to.

01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:38.279
Well, all right, then.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.321
Listen, I'm sorry i blew off

01:08:46.354 --> 01:08:48.490
so much steam back there.

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:51.259
Hey, we're all ready
to get off this island.

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:52.560
Yeah, that's for sure.

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:54.261
Well...

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.263
I'll rig this vine,

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:56.930
and we'll be out of
here in the morning.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.867
Hey, Jake. Look.

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:00.502
Hey!

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:01.903
Hey!

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:06.040
You hear that?

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:07.542
Hey!

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:08.542
Hey! Hey!

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:09.810
Unh!

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:12.779
Shh.

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:15.450
It sounded like a bird.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.352
No, no, no.
That was no bird.

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:30.932
Jake: You see...

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.100
It's the pirates.

01:09:32.134 --> 01:09:34.903
Look. See the boat?

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:37.138
If they find our raft,
we're in trouble, man.

01:09:37.171 --> 01:09:38.673
Let's go. Go.

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:40.841
Listen...

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:43.044
Take the inflatable
and circle the island.

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:45.145
I'll check things out here.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.413
All right.

01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:03.398
Whoo! Got you, sucker!

01:10:03.432 --> 01:10:06.000
Whoo! I got one!

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:07.635
Get to the raft!
Get to the raft!

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:09.904
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:10.905
Get to the raft!

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:12.240
Why?

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:13.741
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:15.109
You see this thing?

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:19.147
Get to the raft.

01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:20.682
Get on!
What?

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:22.483
They found us.

01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:23.585
The pirates are coming.

01:10:23.619 --> 01:10:25.153
Pirates? What...
What about the camp?

01:10:25.187 --> 01:10:26.120
Forget the camp.

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:27.155
We don't have enough time.

01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:28.423
All right.

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:33.127
Tommy, Michael,
now. Get on!

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:36.197
Ok.

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:37.699
Be careful.

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:39.400
Jake: Drop the sail!

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:41.202
Hold on!

01:10:41.236 --> 01:10:42.203
Hold on.

01:10:42.237 --> 01:10:44.939
Get that life jacket
strapped on.

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:46.507
All right.
Ok.

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:47.976
All right, guys.

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:49.677
Ok, here comes one.

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:51.646
Hold on.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.014
Wait, I'll come over here.

01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:53.982
I'll come over.

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:56.651
All right, hold on.
Tommy, Michael.

01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:01.856
Oh, they're leaving.

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:02.957
What are we gonna do?

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:03.925
I don't know.

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:04.959
Can't you go any faster?

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:06.327
No!

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:16.004
What are you doing?

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:17.005
Duck.

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:18.439
She's gonna shoot us!

01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:19.974
Get off! Get off the boat!
Jump off the boat!

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:21.676
Go, go, go!

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:29.984
Good shot.

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:31.119
Tommy!

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:33.121
Come here.

01:11:37.092 --> 01:11:38.993
We'll swim underwater
to the lobster cave.

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:40.128
It's right over there.

01:11:41.163 --> 01:11:42.163
I gotta get this vest off.

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:43.131
Michael!

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:44.132
I can't get the vest off!

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:45.500
We don't have time!

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:46.534
It's you they want!

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:48.336
There's no way!

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:50.772
Listen, I know you'll come
back for me, all right?

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:53.041
Just go, please, go.

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:54.709
Tommy, we'll come back.

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:55.710
Just go, Michael.

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:57.445
I'll come back for you.

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.048
I'll come back for you!

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:01.382
All right!

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:02.517
Swim.

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:29.277
Unh! Frakes is
gonna be mad.

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:30.311
Tommy: You'll
never get him.

01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:31.546
Shut up, kid.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:35.049
Go down and have
a look. They gotta
be here somewhere.

01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:13.521
So what are we gonna do now?

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:15.056
I don't know.

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:17.425
But I know they're
not going anywhere
without you.

01:13:19.361 --> 01:13:20.728
So you're telling me
they're dead?

01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:24.031
They didn't come up,
and we looked for them.

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:26.234
We waited there almost an hour.

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:29.403
I don't know, frakes.
What do you reckon?

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:30.605
How about a cave?

01:13:30.639 --> 01:13:33.207
The reefs are full of them.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:35.276
They'll be back.

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:37.979
What makes you think so?

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:40.848
When they hear you
screaming in pain,

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:43.050
they'll come running.

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:45.186
Trust me.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.628
Any ideas?

01:13:56.131 --> 01:13:57.832
Yeah.

01:13:57.866 --> 01:13:59.667
You still got that gold coin?

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:10.178
Gonna clean all
the scum off that deck,

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:11.512
aren't you, boy?

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:18.352
How do you know he'll go for it?

01:14:18.387 --> 01:14:21.088
Because I know a lot
of greedy people.

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:22.757
I just hope it works.

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:27.962
You gotta promise me something.

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.096
You have to promise me

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.765
that if something goes wrong,

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:33.034
you take Tommy and you
get him out of here.

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:34.936
Don't wait for me.

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:36.170
I promise.

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:44.445
I'm sorry about your boat.

01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:47.849
Ah...

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:49.483
I hated that boat.

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:52.553
You hated that boat?

01:14:52.588 --> 01:14:53.621
Yeah.

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:54.989
I thought it was your life.

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:57.291
Oh, no. It was
my dad's life.

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:59.460
He chose it for the both of us.

01:14:59.494 --> 01:15:00.628
Don't get me wrong.

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:02.830
I love the sea and everything.

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:04.465
It's just...

01:15:04.499 --> 01:15:08.169
I think I stuck
with her for so long...

01:15:08.203 --> 01:15:11.172
'Cause my dad loved her.

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:12.640
And...

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:17.979
Anyway, uh...

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:22.917
<i>Tiffany,</i> she's been
sinkin' for a long time.

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:24.485
And I've been hangin' on to her

01:15:24.519 --> 01:15:26.888
for all the wrong reasons.

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:29.357
You know, I...

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:32.760
I've been also blaming people

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:34.795
for things i don't have.

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:37.932
You should take
this back. I'm sorry.

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:42.737
Keep it.

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:45.439
No, no, no, no.
I can't do that.

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:48.342
Not because I could go
out and buy another one.

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:50.578
I want you to have it.

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:58.085
I don't know what to say.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.488
You don't need to say anything.

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:02.189
Come on, we got a lot to do.

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:20.574
Frakes, you better
come and see this.

01:16:38.694 --> 01:16:40.061
Good morning.

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:43.731
Could be.
That just depends.

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:47.735
Are you ok, Tommy?

01:16:49.738 --> 01:16:51.872
So, where's your friend?

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:54.275
I don't know.

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:55.543
I got a deal for you.

01:16:55.577 --> 01:16:57.345
Oh, he's got a deal for us.

01:16:57.379 --> 01:16:59.747
He's got a deal for us, guys.

01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:00.948
So what's the deal?

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:02.850
Well, you seem to be

01:17:02.884 --> 01:17:05.319
a financially motivated person.

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:07.455
So let's talk bottom line.

01:17:07.489 --> 01:17:10.591
You think I'm worth
a lot of money,
don't you?

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:12.793
Wow, a psychic.

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:14.228
Well, I don't know if my family

01:17:14.262 --> 01:17:16.297
would pay a dime
for me right now.

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:18.866
But what if i had a way...

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:22.536
To get you 10 to 15 million

01:17:22.571 --> 01:17:24.739
in gold coins?

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:26.741
Would you leave us alone?

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:28.109
Gold.

01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:41.956
Ok, I'm listening.

01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:45.026
I found...

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.260
A whole ton of those

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:47.995
right here on this island.

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:50.231
But you won't get any of it...

01:17:50.265 --> 01:17:52.333
Unless you promise me
you're gonna let
Tommy go.

01:17:52.367 --> 01:17:56.370
Why don't you
just tell me where
they are, pretty boy?

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:58.739
Because I won't.

01:17:58.774 --> 01:18:00.741
Tommy and I figured
we'd be dying

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:03.177
on this stinkin' island anyway.

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:05.880
So by shooting us...

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:08.983
You'd just be putting us
out of our misery.

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:10.951
Ok.

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:14.255
This is what
I'm gonna do for you.

01:18:14.289 --> 01:18:16.090
I'm gonna let him go...

01:18:16.124 --> 01:18:18.025
But you're gonna
tell us where it is.

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:21.295
If it's what you
say it is, then...

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:23.998
I don't have to waste
my time with you.

01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:26.500
Ok?

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:29.470
You have to swear
to let us go.
I want your word.

01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:31.005
Don't listen to anything...

01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:32.807
Sure. You have my word...

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:34.742
As a gentleman.

01:18:36.478 --> 01:18:37.778
All right, then.

01:18:40.048 --> 01:18:41.515
Tommy.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.584
Just keep walking
along the beach.

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:49.423
It's ok. Go.

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.464
All right, let's go.

01:18:58.433 --> 01:19:01.635
You stay with the boat.
I don't want those kids
anywhere near it.

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:02.770
Yeah.

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:13.647
Aah!

01:19:13.682 --> 01:19:14.648
Oh.

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:16.016
Ah. Miss me?

01:19:21.339 --> 01:19:22.807
Frakes:
How much further?

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:24.241

The gold's in there.

01:20:26.538 --> 01:20:29.440
I'm not going in there.

01:20:29.474 --> 01:20:31.509
It's a death cave.

01:20:31.543 --> 01:20:32.977
Oh, give me a break.

01:20:33.011 --> 01:20:34.411
Those symbols, frakes...

01:20:34.446 --> 01:20:36.480
They call them
"the gatherers."

01:20:36.515 --> 01:20:37.915
They were the cannibals

01:20:37.949 --> 01:20:40.217
that cut off
the heads before
they shrank them.

01:20:40.252 --> 01:20:41.652
Who cares?

01:20:49.828 --> 01:20:51.829
These places are haunted.

01:20:51.863 --> 01:20:53.097
Cursed.

01:20:53.131 --> 01:20:54.365
Hey...

01:20:54.399 --> 01:20:55.499
You don't help,

01:20:55.534 --> 01:20:57.735
you don't get
a cut. Got it?

01:21:04.476 --> 01:21:06.310
Jonas:
I don't like this.

01:21:06.344 --> 01:21:08.746
Frakes: Shut up.

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.648
All right, where is it?

01:21:10.682 --> 01:21:13.117
Right up ahead here.

01:21:26.731 --> 01:21:29.166
It's right up there
around the corner.

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:43.581
Around where?

01:21:49.421 --> 01:21:51.555
Aah!

01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:53.190
Aah!

01:22:18.783 --> 01:22:21.352
I'd like a pizza to go, please.

01:22:27.092 --> 01:22:28.158
Jake: Hey!

01:22:34.866 --> 01:22:37.368
Aw, gee, I see some scum
i forgot to wipe off.

01:22:39.804 --> 01:22:41.138
Jake: Tommy, let's go!

01:23:03.261 --> 01:23:04.361
Uhh!

01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:21.812
Keep you eye out
for him on the shore.

01:23:36.494 --> 01:23:37.461
There.

01:23:37.495 --> 01:23:40.064
Guys! Hey!

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:41.432
Michael!

01:23:41.466 --> 01:23:43.600
Michael!

01:23:43.635 --> 01:23:45.335
Hey!

01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:47.071
Michael! Michael!

01:23:47.105 --> 01:23:49.740
What?

01:23:54.212 --> 01:23:55.145
What are we gonna do?

01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:56.914
What do you mean,
what are we gonna do?

01:23:56.948 --> 01:23:58.282
This guy's got a gun.
We're gettin' out of here.

01:23:58.316 --> 01:23:59.483
We'll come back with some help.

01:23:59.517 --> 01:24:00.484
We can't leave him.

01:24:00.518 --> 01:24:04.021
I promised
I'd get you out of here.

01:24:04.055 --> 01:24:04.988
Well, break it.

01:24:05.023 --> 01:24:06.724
I can't!
I promised!

01:24:06.758 --> 01:24:07.858
Hey! He didn't
give up on me, Jake,

01:24:07.892 --> 01:24:09.526
and he wouldn't give up on you.

01:24:09.561 --> 01:24:10.594
He needs your help.

01:24:10.628 --> 01:24:12.129
Please!

01:24:14.899 --> 01:24:16.600
Michael!

01:24:16.634 --> 01:24:19.837
Everest! Michael,
go to Everest!

01:25:07.519 --> 01:25:09.486
Ok.

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:10.621
Trust him.

01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:48.992
No!

01:26:13.918 --> 01:26:15.018
Come on.

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:23.327
Are you all right?

01:26:23.361 --> 01:26:24.328
Oh...

01:26:24.362 --> 01:26:25.495
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:26:25.530 --> 01:26:28.332
Ah! Oh, ho ho ho.

01:26:33.605 --> 01:26:35.239
Well, tough guy...

01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:36.440
We did it, huh?

01:26:36.474 --> 01:26:37.574
Yeah.

01:26:38.843 --> 01:26:40.510
Ahh...

01:26:40.545 --> 01:26:42.512
Oh...

01:26:42.547 --> 01:26:44.548
Whoo!

01:26:44.582 --> 01:26:46.350
Let's get the boat.

01:26:48.853 --> 01:26:50.520
Tommy: I can't
believe you made it.

01:26:50.555 --> 01:26:51.655
Yeah.

01:26:51.689 --> 01:26:54.925
Oh... Jake.

01:26:57.262 --> 01:26:58.295
Ah...

01:26:59.898 --> 01:27:01.798
Oh, man, thanks.

01:27:09.707 --> 01:27:12.342
Island patrol,
this is Jake hunter.

01:27:12.377 --> 01:27:13.510
Come in. Over.

01:27:13.544 --> 01:27:15.212
Butch: Good to hear
your voice, Jake.

01:27:15.246 --> 01:27:16.680
We've been searching
for you guys for days.

01:27:16.714 --> 01:27:18.515
I lost the <i> Tiffany,</i> butch.

01:27:18.549 --> 01:27:20.050
Everyone's safe, but listen...

01:27:20.084 --> 01:27:22.119
I got a location on some
of that pirate scum

01:27:22.153 --> 01:27:23.086
you've been looking for.

01:27:23.121 --> 01:27:24.788
Maybe you should pick it up.

01:27:35.166 --> 01:27:36.333
Michael...

01:27:36.367 --> 01:27:37.668
Tommy!

01:27:51.282 --> 01:27:53.383
Tommy: Mom.

01:27:53.418 --> 01:27:55.385
Tommy, oh...

01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:57.387
Hey, Michael.

01:27:57.422 --> 01:27:58.655
Hey, dad.

01:27:58.690 --> 01:27:59.990
How are you, man?

01:28:01.092 --> 01:28:02.359
I didn't mean what
i said about mark.

01:28:02.393 --> 01:28:03.660
Oh, honey, don't worry about it.

01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:04.761
Really?

01:28:04.796 --> 01:28:06.263
You think you could ask him

01:28:06.297 --> 01:28:07.597
to make me another frame?

01:28:07.632 --> 01:28:09.066
I kind of lost the last one.

01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:11.001
I'm sure he'll be glad to.

01:28:11.035 --> 01:28:12.102
Oh...

01:28:12.136 --> 01:28:13.403
Glenn: Michael...

01:28:13.438 --> 01:28:14.404
Hey, dad.

01:28:14.439 --> 01:28:15.639
Oh, I'm so glad
you're all right.

01:28:15.673 --> 01:28:17.541
Yeah, I feel...
I feel good.

01:28:17.575 --> 01:28:18.508
How's mom?

01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:20.444
Glenn: Well, she's
just worried sick

01:28:20.478 --> 01:28:21.645
waiting for us to call her.

01:28:21.679 --> 01:28:23.480
Ok. All right.

01:28:23.514 --> 01:28:24.448
Hey.

01:28:24.482 --> 01:28:26.083
Oh, hi.
How are you doing?

01:28:26.117 --> 01:28:28.318
Well, I'm ok.

01:28:32.190 --> 01:28:33.490
Oh, hey, um, guys,

01:28:33.524 --> 01:28:34.591
I want you to meet someone.

01:28:34.625 --> 01:28:35.592
This is, uh, Jake hunter.

01:28:35.626 --> 01:28:37.861
He's the captain of our boat.

01:28:37.895 --> 01:28:39.997
He saved our lives.

01:28:40.031 --> 01:28:42.966
Well, Jake,
it's a real pleasure.

01:28:43.001 --> 01:28:44.835
I can't thank you enough.

01:28:44.869 --> 01:28:45.902
Yeah, thank you...

01:28:45.937 --> 01:28:47.971
A lot.

01:28:49.007 --> 01:28:50.707
All right, let's
go make that call.

01:28:50.742 --> 01:28:52.576
Come on, Jake.
Join us for dinner.

01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:53.710
Come on.

01:29:03.354 --> 01:29:04.521
Hello, everyone.

01:29:04.555 --> 01:29:06.323
Hey, Michael,
where have you been?

01:29:06.357 --> 01:29:08.158
Let's just say that, um,

01:29:08.192 --> 01:29:11.561
preparation has met opportunity.

01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:13.196
I hope you guys don't mind,

01:29:13.231 --> 01:29:16.199
but I created a little
job opportunity for us.

01:29:19.137 --> 01:29:21.271
Here? What is it?

01:29:21.305 --> 01:29:24.541
We're gonna rename
that boat, uh...

01:29:24.575 --> 01:29:26.510
The <i> Tiffany ii...</i>

01:29:26.544 --> 01:29:28.111
Captain.

01:29:28.146 --> 01:29:30.013
What?

01:29:30.048 --> 01:29:31.915
They gave us a reward
for turning in frakes,

01:29:31.949 --> 01:29:33.784
so I did a little negotiating.

01:29:33.818 --> 01:29:36.953
See, they were
gonna put this boat
up for auction,

01:29:36.988 --> 01:29:38.588
so I offered to buy the boat

01:29:38.623 --> 01:29:39.823
with our reward money.

01:29:39.857 --> 01:29:41.858
We are all gonna be partners

01:29:41.893 --> 01:29:44.428
in the charter business.

01:29:47.999 --> 01:29:49.933
Are you serious?

01:29:49.967 --> 01:29:50.901
Yeah.

01:29:50.935 --> 01:29:52.335
I mean, you said it yourself...

01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:54.171
Charters sell out here
all the time.

01:29:54.205 --> 01:29:57.140
And, uh, dad, I was
hoping that, um...

01:29:57.175 --> 01:29:59.276
That I could pay you back
the money I owe you

01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:00.777
out of my share of the profits.

01:30:00.812 --> 01:30:02.979
That sounds great, but...

01:30:03.014 --> 01:30:05.816
Does that mean
that you're planning
to move to Australia?

01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:09.086
No, I don't think I'm
gonna need to do that.

01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:12.756
I was actually kind
of hoping that, uh,

01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:15.492
the file clerk job
was still available.

01:30:15.526 --> 01:30:16.993
Because, uh, you know,

01:30:17.028 --> 01:30:18.562
if I'm gonna be a lawyer...

01:30:20.031 --> 01:30:21.364
I better learn about it, right?

01:30:21.399 --> 01:30:22.666
Inside and out, top to bottom.

01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:23.667
Glenn: Top to bottom.

01:30:23.701 --> 01:30:24.668
Top to bottom.

01:30:24.702 --> 01:30:27.003
Besides, I think it
would be kind of cool

01:30:27.038 --> 01:30:29.206
to do lunch with my dad
every now and then.

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:31.208
That sounds great, son.

01:30:31.242 --> 01:30:32.242
So, we really own it?

01:30:32.276 --> 01:30:33.577
It's really ours?

01:30:33.611 --> 01:30:36.646
As long as we all agree on it.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:38.849
It's gonna be
a 3-way partnership.

01:30:40.818 --> 01:30:42.752
What do you guys say?

01:30:46.057 --> 01:30:48.058
I don't know what to say.

01:30:48.092 --> 01:30:49.960
Well, I say yes.

01:30:52.063 --> 01:30:53.163
Uh...

01:30:56.567 --> 01:30:57.634
Yes.

01:31:00.238 --> 01:31:02.205
Absolutely yes.

01:31:03.074 --> 01:31:05.842
Then a partnership it is.
