01:02.034 --> 01:03.968
<i>Okay.</i>

01:07.640 --> 01:09.267
<i>911 emergency.</i>

01:13.846 --> 01:15.609
I need an ambulance.

01:15.815 --> 01:20.507
<i>I have you at 9212 West Third</i>
<i>Street in Los Angeles.</i>

01:23.522 --> 01:26.116
Yes, room number 2.

01:26.325 --> 01:28.555
<i>What's the emergency?</i>

01:30.896 --> 01:33.057
There's been a suicide.

01:33.266 --> 01:35.166
<i>Who's the victim?</i>

01:37.136 --> 01:38.763
I am.

01:45.144 --> 01:50.309
<i>In seven days,</i>
<i>God created the world.</i>

01:53.686 --> 01:55.813
<i>And in seven seconds...</i>

01:59.425 --> 02:02.019
<i>... I shattered mine.</i>

02:55.614 --> 02:59.607
- <i>I can have four new fillets overnight.</i>
- Oh, no. No, thank you.

02:59.819 --> 03:01.946
What is your name again? Ezra?
Is that right?

03:02.154 --> 03:04.884
Yes, sir. I'll just need
your first and last name...

03:05.091 --> 03:07.355
...so I can call up your account.
- <i>You know what?</i>

03:07.560 --> 03:11.462
Here's what I'm thinking, Ezra. I think
I'm gonna mail you the meat back...

03:11.664 --> 03:14.997
...so you can see firsthand the type
of dog food that you're peddling.

03:15.201 --> 03:18.693
That won't be necessary, sir.

03:18.904 --> 03:21.668
So how about we just start
with your last name?

03:21.874 --> 03:23.068
Thomas.

03:23.275 --> 03:25.140
And don't even get me started
on the pork.

03:25.344 --> 03:27.505
- Have you tried the pork?
- <i>Well, no, sir.</i>

03:27.713 --> 03:31.205
I'm not much of a meat eater myself,
but I hear really great things...

03:31.417 --> 03:32.577
...about the pork.

03:32.785 --> 03:36.016
- Oh, so you don't eat pork at all?
- No, sir.

03:36.222 --> 03:40.022
Are you Jewish?
Is that why you don't eat pork, Ezra?

03:42.194 --> 03:46.688
Well, can we...?
What's your first name, Mr. Thomas?

03:48.267 --> 03:49.734
Ben.

03:54.707 --> 03:56.038
Hold on, what was that voice?

03:56.242 --> 03:59.575
I don't... I don't have an order
for a Ben Thomas.

03:59.779 --> 04:02.179
Ezra, what was that voice?

04:02.381 --> 04:04.872
- What voice?
- Are you blind?

04:05.084 --> 04:07.609
- Excuse me?
- <i>You're kidding me.</i>

04:07.820 --> 04:13.019
A blind beef salesman
who doesn't eat meat.

04:13.626 --> 04:17.858
<i>Now, that... That is rich.</i>
<i>That is rich.</i>

04:18.063 --> 04:19.860
Have you ever had sex, Ezra?

04:21.600 --> 04:24.535
Did Lawrence in Accounting
put you up to this?

04:24.737 --> 04:28.002
Because somehow I can't imagine
the blind, vegan...

04:28.207 --> 04:30.437
<i>... beef salesman having sex.</i>

04:30.643 --> 04:33.908
- Listen, I'm trying to help you, sir.
- <i>You're trying to help me?</i>

04:34.113 --> 04:36.946
The blind beef salesman
is trying to help me?

04:37.149 --> 04:40.141
I'm actually starting to feel
pretty bad for you, Ezra.

04:40.352 --> 04:44.482
Because I look at my life, and it is
surrounded by so much beauty...

04:44.690 --> 04:47.853
<i>... and you can't see shit.</i>

04:48.060 --> 04:49.755
Is that fair?

04:49.962 --> 04:51.589
Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?

04:51.797 --> 04:54.061
Do you even know
what color the ocean is?

04:54.867 --> 04:56.494
<i>Do you?</i>

04:57.002 --> 04:59.436
- It's blue, sir.
- <i>"It's blue, sir."</i>

04:59.638 --> 05:00.900
Say what you wanna say.

05:01.106 --> 05:03.074
<i>React.</i>
<i>Say what you wanna say to me.</i>

05:03.275 --> 05:05.004
Thank you for calling
Cheyenne Meats.

05:05.211 --> 05:09.011
That's not what you wanna say,
you coward. You coward.

05:09.215 --> 05:13.242
You blind, vegan, beef-salesman,
virgin coward!

05:13.452 --> 05:16.580
- Goodbye, Mr. Thomas.
- <i>Say what you wanna say.</i>

05:37.776 --> 05:42.839
Ken Anderson. Nicole Anderson.
Allie Anderson. Ed Rice.

05:43.048 --> 05:47.485
Steven Phillips. Monica Freeman.
Sarah Jensen.

05:52.925 --> 05:57.259
Ken Anderson! Nicole Anderson!
Allie Anderson! Ed Rice!

05:57.463 --> 06:02.127
Steven Phillips! Monica Freeman!
And Sarah Jensen!

07:45.771 --> 07:47.295
Hi, can I help you?

07:47.506 --> 07:51.966
Yes. Hello, I'm looking for Emily.

07:52.177 --> 07:53.872
- You're a friend of hers?
- Yes, ma'am.

07:54.079 --> 07:55.444
- She's not home.
- Oh, goodness.

07:55.648 --> 07:58.708
No, she left this morning.
She had to do some more tests.

07:59.585 --> 08:02.213
She asked me to watch Duke
until she got back.

08:02.688 --> 08:04.383
Okay.

08:05.124 --> 08:08.025
You ever try mixing banana peel
into the soil?

08:08.227 --> 08:11.128
- Really?
- It works, I swear.

08:11.330 --> 08:15.596
Oh, would you by chance
know where I could find her?

08:23.676 --> 08:28.511
<i>Supervisor to 104.</i>
<i>Supervisor to 104.</i>

08:30.349 --> 08:31.338
Cardiac wing?

08:31.550 --> 08:33.916
Take the elevator to the fifth floor
then turn left.

08:34.119 --> 08:35.881
Thank you.

08:38.256 --> 08:42.193
Well, that's what I was just saying.
It's absolutely impossible.

08:45.698 --> 08:47.529
Hold the elevator.

08:49.368 --> 08:51.199
Thank you.

09:45.924 --> 09:47.915
Can I help you?

09:49.361 --> 09:51.352
Yes. Good evening.

09:52.397 --> 09:54.729
I'm here to see Emily Posa.

09:54.933 --> 09:58.960
I'm sorry, visiting hours
are from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.

10:00.205 --> 10:03.231
You know, it is really important
I speak to her for just a moment.

10:03.442 --> 10:07.071
You'll just have to come back
during visiting hours.

10:08.647 --> 10:10.706
Thank you very much.

11:06.071 --> 11:08.232
So if there is one thing
that I have learned...

11:08.440 --> 11:11.238
...and you all should remember
about winning these contracts:

11:11.443 --> 11:15.140
Three steps. First, tell them
what you're gonna tell them.

11:15.347 --> 11:17.315
Step two, you tell them.

11:17.516 --> 11:20.917
Step three,
tell them what you told them.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.449
We are gonna close
by reminding them...

11:23.655 --> 11:27.147
...that old girl has a 3-percent better
impulse from sea level to vacuum...

11:27.359 --> 11:31.318
...and if they pass on that, quite
frankly, they deserve another Sputnik.

11:37.002 --> 11:38.560
Now, if you will excuse me...

11:38.770 --> 11:42.331
...I have a very lovely, very hungry
woman at home waiting for me.

11:45.344 --> 11:46.606
<i>Sarah.</i>

11:49.781 --> 11:51.271
Honey.

11:53.919 --> 11:57.150
Everyone at work kept saying
it was daylight-savings time.

11:57.356 --> 11:59.187
You were supposed
to be here a while ago.

11:59.391 --> 12:02.554
- I kept saying it wasn't.
- This happens all the time. It's work.

12:02.761 --> 12:04.991
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, I'm angry with you.

12:05.197 --> 12:06.755
I'm gonna be angry all night long.

12:06.965 --> 12:08.990
- I'm angry with you.
- What are you doing?

12:09.201 --> 12:12.034
How about that?
How about I'm angry with you?

12:23.782 --> 12:27.274
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. It's your brother.

12:28.487 --> 12:30.148
<i>Where are you?</i>

12:31.189 --> 12:33.123
I'm at the beach house.

12:33.325 --> 12:35.793
<i>Are you okay?</i>

12:37.229 --> 12:38.696
Of course.

12:39.731 --> 12:42.996
<i>Listen, why'd you disconnect</i>
<i>the landline?</i>

12:44.569 --> 12:47.003
The phone broke.

12:47.205 --> 12:49.469
<i>I don't need it anymore.</i>

12:50.509 --> 12:53.342
Did I? Did I do something?

12:54.613 --> 12:56.240
No.

12:56.949 --> 12:58.883
Not unless you're smoking again.

12:59.084 --> 13:04.078
No, I've put on 20 pounds.
I'm in the best shape of my life.

13:04.856 --> 13:07.324
<i>Are you eating?</i>
<i>Are you taking care of yourself?</i>

13:07.526 --> 13:11.462
- <i>You sound terrible again and...</i>
- Yeah, I'm fine. Look, I gotta go.

13:11.663 --> 13:14.530
Give Melanie and the kids
a hug and a kiss.

13:14.733 --> 13:17.634
I'll talk to you later.
You take care of yourself.

13:17.836 --> 13:21.932
Hold on. I know it's been a while,
but when you were staying here...

13:22.140 --> 13:26.008
...you didn't take something of mine
by mistake, did you?

13:27.012 --> 13:29.446
I remember giving you something.

13:31.416 --> 13:35.409
You remember that?
Because I remember that very clearly.

13:36.388 --> 13:39.050
Yeah. Yeah.

13:41.326 --> 13:43.021
Just remember I love you.

14:19.998 --> 14:23.161
Hi, my name is Ben Thomas.
I'm here to see Stewart Goodman.

14:23.368 --> 14:26.667
Inez, look at me, please.

14:27.239 --> 14:30.367
Inez. I'm speaking to you.

14:32.644 --> 14:35.772
I understand you refused to take
your meds again. Is that true?

14:35.981 --> 14:37.676
No, no, no.

14:40.585 --> 14:43.645
Let's try using your words
this time, okay, Inez?

14:43.855 --> 14:46.517
I mean, this silent treatment
isn't doing anybody any good.

14:46.725 --> 14:49.023
Inez, how can we help you if...?

14:49.828 --> 14:51.625
Okay, how about I come back
tomorrow...

14:51.830 --> 14:55.732
...and see if you've changed
your mind, okay?

14:55.934 --> 14:57.731
Thattagirl.

15:00.939 --> 15:03.339
I thought I was coming
to your office today.

15:03.542 --> 15:06.943
I was in the neighborhood. I thought
I'd stop by, save you the drive.

15:07.145 --> 15:10.581
Terrific. Well, look, let's go talk
in my office, yeah? Come on.

15:10.782 --> 15:12.147
<i>I take a no-nonsense approach.</i>

15:12.350 --> 15:14.580
I mean, I cut the operating costs
of this place...

15:14.786 --> 15:17.380
...over 17 percent last year alone.

15:17.589 --> 15:21.958
- I'm sure that made them happy.
- Oh, hell, yeah.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.185
Now, if I could only get
my own finances...

15:24.396 --> 15:27.126
...in that kind of shape,
I wouldn't have you sitting here.

15:27.332 --> 15:28.560
No offense.

15:28.767 --> 15:30.860
That your new Beemer out front?

15:35.707 --> 15:38.733
Ben, I mean, when I found out...

15:38.944 --> 15:41.538
...that my bone-marrow transplant
wasn't successful...

15:41.746 --> 15:45.307
I'm well aware of your
ongoing medical condition.

15:45.984 --> 15:48.145
Things aren't looking
very promising for me.

15:51.590 --> 15:53.581
Look...

15:53.792 --> 15:55.885
...I have a bonus coming in January.

15:56.094 --> 15:59.359
I just really need
this six-month extension.

16:00.932 --> 16:04.095
Really, I mean, I am doing the very
best I can here, I promise you.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.212
I'm gonna show myself out.

16:17.883 --> 16:18.872
I'll be in touch.

16:19.084 --> 16:21.018
Well, thank you. I appreciate it.

16:21.219 --> 16:23.687
I mean, this way
everybody wins, right?

16:36.134 --> 16:37.294
Hello.

16:45.076 --> 16:46.873
My name is Ben.

16:48.880 --> 16:52.748
I totally understand
if you don't wanna speak to me either.

16:52.951 --> 16:57.081
But I would really like
to just have a moment of your time.

17:16.340 --> 17:21.335
I'm trying to figure out
what kind of man Stewart Goodman is.

17:24.182 --> 17:30.143
It is within my power to drastically
change his circumstances.

17:32.457 --> 17:36.018
But I don't wanna give that man
a gift that he doesn't deserve.

17:38.997 --> 17:43.366
I need you to tell me
whether or not he is a good person.

18:10.996 --> 18:13.692
"The drug he gives me...

18:15.734 --> 18:17.827
...makes me dizzy.

18:21.206 --> 18:23.367
I want a new one."

18:23.575 --> 18:26.772
Well, that sounds
very reasonable, Inez.

18:27.545 --> 18:29.240
What else?

18:31.916 --> 18:33.383
You can trust me.

18:37.289 --> 18:38.847
What else, Inez?

18:55.440 --> 18:57.203
He's punishing you?

18:58.043 --> 19:00.238
How is he punishing you?

19:04.849 --> 19:07.283
How is he punishing you, Inez?

19:30.975 --> 19:32.533
Ben?

19:33.545 --> 19:35.775
- Hey, Ben, where you going?
- Where's the washroom?

19:35.980 --> 19:38.141
To the right. Is there a problem?

19:38.350 --> 19:41.148
- Give her a bath, right now.
- Absolutely.

19:41.353 --> 19:44.516
Thank you. Thank you.

19:46.558 --> 19:48.150
You have the wrong
impression here.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.089
I'm gonna stop by
from time to time...

19:50.295 --> 19:52.593
...make sure you're showing
these people some respect.

19:52.797 --> 19:54.992
Look, this is
a misunderstanding, okay?

19:55.200 --> 19:57.293
You don't treat people like that.

19:57.502 --> 19:59.094
Let me explain, okay, Ben?

19:59.304 --> 20:01.238
- And I'm not giving you an extension.
- Ben!

20:01.439 --> 20:03.532
I'm not giving you anything.

20:04.342 --> 20:06.776
I almost believed you,
you son of a bitch.

20:06.978 --> 20:09.310
I almost believed.

20:18.656 --> 20:20.590
Okay. Grip and rip.

20:20.792 --> 20:24.922
This time it's gonna be
a lot different.

20:26.431 --> 20:28.296
Hey.

20:29.267 --> 20:31.929
- Hey, Michelle.
- Hey.

20:32.504 --> 20:36.133
- Good to see you.
- You too.

20:36.341 --> 20:37.433
- How are you?
- I'm good.

20:37.642 --> 20:39.769
- Hey, man.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

20:39.978 --> 20:43.880
Just coming to make sure that she
is still kicking your ass at everything.

20:44.082 --> 20:45.982
And I am.

20:46.718 --> 20:48.845
- Can we have a sec, hon?
- Yeah.

20:49.053 --> 20:50.987
All right.

20:51.423 --> 20:52.549
You okay?

20:52.757 --> 20:57.285
Yeah, I'm good. You said you were
gonna call me on the 15th.

20:57.495 --> 20:58.894
- Today is the 19th.
- I know.

20:59.097 --> 21:02.430
Doctor didn't have the results,
so I had no information to give you.

21:02.634 --> 21:04.499
Still, you should call me.

21:04.702 --> 21:07.296
- Yeah, I know. Yes, I know.
- We're still friends. Right?

21:07.505 --> 21:10.372
Yeah. I'm just...

21:11.042 --> 21:13.033
I'm doing some soul-searching,
you know?

21:16.381 --> 21:17.370
Don't do that.

21:18.049 --> 21:19.141
- We have a plan.
- I know.

21:19.350 --> 21:21.648
- Do what you promised me.
- I will.

21:21.853 --> 21:23.980
You know, they rent clubs
up at the clubhouse.

21:24.189 --> 21:25.918
I'm well aware of that.

21:26.124 --> 21:29.355
I think I'm gonna keep my ass
unkicked today.

22:47.005 --> 22:50.372
Were you looking at him,
or were you looking at me?

22:52.110 --> 22:54.408
Actually, I was just sitting here.

22:54.612 --> 22:56.807
Am I doing it wrong?

22:57.448 --> 23:00.315
I think I saw you
in the elevator the other day.

23:00.518 --> 23:02.452
Oh, yes.

23:04.689 --> 23:07.658
Actually, you are being audited.

23:09.460 --> 23:10.859
My name is Ben Thomas.

23:11.062 --> 23:15.158
I'm with the IRS,
and you owe the government...

23:15.366 --> 23:18.824
...$56, 240.19.

23:19.037 --> 23:20.766
I know.

23:20.972 --> 23:23.372
And now you get me.

23:24.542 --> 23:26.442
Would you have a seat, please,
Miss Posa?

23:28.079 --> 23:31.879
So I've been looking over
the income statements...

23:32.083 --> 23:35.541
...from the last three years.

23:35.753 --> 23:37.220
- 2005...
- Were...?

23:38.690 --> 23:41.318
Were you in my room
the other night?

23:42.894 --> 23:47.456
No, ma'am, I was not
in your room the other night.

23:48.766 --> 23:52.429
That's not exactly IRS protocol.

23:52.637 --> 23:54.969
So I've been looking over
'05, '06 and '07.

23:55.173 --> 23:59.166
There seems to be quite a disparity
between what you claimed and...

23:59.377 --> 24:00.639
Mr. Thomas?

24:02.680 --> 24:05.649
I just got discharged.

24:05.850 --> 24:08.148
So, you know,
unless you're gonna, like...

24:08.353 --> 24:10.446
...haul me off
to some IRS jail or something...

24:10.655 --> 24:13.988
...I'd really like to get home now.

24:14.192 --> 24:18.151
- Oh, sure. No problem.
- Okay.

24:19.097 --> 24:20.792
I'll be in touch.

25:01.272 --> 25:04.605
Welcome to the Travel Inn.
Can I help you?

25:04.809 --> 25:06.140
I need a room.

25:06.344 --> 25:07.777
How many hours?

25:10.181 --> 25:12.115
About two weeks.

25:43.581 --> 25:46.175
Clear it! That's it, that's it!

25:46.751 --> 25:49.242
All right, come on! <i>Vamos,</i> Manny!

25:50.421 --> 25:52.821
All right, all right. That's it, that's it.

25:53.958 --> 25:55.516
Hey!

25:57.328 --> 25:58.659
- What you want?
- Break it up!

25:58.863 --> 26:01.195
- You want some of this?
- Get off! Get off!

26:01.399 --> 26:03.697
Hey, Rico, knock it off!

26:03.901 --> 26:06.165
Somebody wanna remind Rico
where we are?

26:06.370 --> 26:08.201
The sanctuary, coach!

26:08.406 --> 26:11.239
- I can't hear you.
- The sanctuary, coach!

26:11.442 --> 26:14.138
That's right, Rico, in the sanctuary.

26:14.345 --> 26:16.939
Now give me 20 starts and stops.

26:17.548 --> 26:18.947
<i>Hello, this is Emily Posa.</i>

26:19.150 --> 26:22.244
<i>I'm not home right now,</i>
<i>but please leave a message...</i>

26:22.453 --> 26:26.150
<i>... and I'll call you back</i>
<i>as soon as possible. Thank you.</i>

26:26.357 --> 26:29.019
<i>Hi, my name is Susan Nall.</i>
<i>I'm calling because a friend...</i>

26:29.227 --> 26:32.663
<i>... told me you do letterpress</i>
<i>invitations, and I was wondering...</i>

26:32.864 --> 26:35.458
Hello? Hi, this is Emily.

26:38.469 --> 26:41.632
Yep, I do wedding invitations.

26:41.839 --> 26:44.239
I'm not able to take any requests,
though, right now.

26:44.809 --> 26:47.607
I know someone nearby who does it.

26:47.812 --> 26:51.748
She's not as good as I am,
but her prices are very...

26:53.718 --> 26:55.185
Hello?

27:02.226 --> 27:03.750
Duke?

27:07.899 --> 27:09.389
Duke.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.329
We're out here.

27:18.176 --> 27:20.041
Hello, Miss Posa.

27:20.878 --> 27:22.402
What are you doing here?

27:22.613 --> 27:24.103
Oh, I came to see you.

27:24.315 --> 27:26.647
Don't you people ever call ahead?

27:27.752 --> 27:29.720
You people tend to try
to hide things.

27:29.921 --> 27:31.388
Is that meat?

27:31.589 --> 27:33.853
No! No, no.

27:34.058 --> 27:36.390
No. No meat. No.

27:36.594 --> 27:40.928
- Well, he was really enjoying it.
- He eats steamed broccoli and tofu.

27:41.132 --> 27:43.623
- Why?
- He's a vegetarian.

27:44.368 --> 27:47.098
- He is a vegetarian?
- Yes.

27:47.305 --> 27:49.466
Well, that sucks.

27:49.674 --> 27:53.201
Hey, can we talk?
Do you have a moment?

27:53.744 --> 27:55.177
No.

27:55.379 --> 27:57.847
Actually, I have to take Duke
for a walk.

27:58.482 --> 28:02.919
No problem. I'll go with you,
if you don't mind.

28:04.055 --> 28:06.285
- So...
- Hey, hey.

28:06.490 --> 28:07.980
Hey.

28:08.192 --> 28:14.028
So I've been looking over
2005, 2006 and 2007.

28:14.232 --> 28:15.893
Now...

28:16.100 --> 28:17.567
I'm listening.

28:17.768 --> 28:21.670
- Can I get him for you?
- Nope. I got him.

28:22.373 --> 28:24.807
Let me get him. Let me get him.
Let me get him.

28:25.009 --> 28:26.806
- You all right?
- Yes.

28:27.979 --> 28:29.844
Whoa, sorry. Whoa, not these.

28:30.047 --> 28:34.381
- That's okay. Watch...
- No, no. Heel, heel, heel.

28:35.052 --> 28:38.044
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't
feed him meat.

28:38.256 --> 28:40.247
So I've been looking over...

28:42.426 --> 28:45.190
- Yeah, maybe we can do this later.
- Yeah.

28:49.133 --> 28:52.000
So you cook it all
ahead of time, I see.

28:52.203 --> 28:55.366
No, actually. I can't remember
the last time I cooked.

28:55.573 --> 29:00.670
This is my sister's way
of looking out for me from afar.

29:00.878 --> 29:02.402
Do you have any siblings?

29:02.613 --> 29:05.480
Yes, one brother.

29:05.683 --> 29:07.776
He's a... He's a good egg.

29:07.985 --> 29:10.783
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.

29:11.956 --> 29:14.652
Are you receiving income
from any source...

29:14.859 --> 29:17.123
...that the government
is currently unaware of?

29:17.328 --> 29:21.492
Well, lately I've been taking
to diving in local wishing wells, so...

29:21.699 --> 29:24.930
I mean, but it's just occasional dimes
here and there...

29:25.136 --> 29:26.865
...or, once in a while, a quarter.

29:28.172 --> 29:30.333
No, actually...

29:30.541 --> 29:34.068
...I had to refinance this place
to pay my past-due medical bills.

29:34.979 --> 29:40.178
I've been informed that you suffer
from congenital heart failure.

29:40.384 --> 29:44.878
Yes. Did you gather that
while stalking me at the hospital?

29:45.356 --> 29:47.324
No, I...

29:48.492 --> 29:52.258
You're currently Status 2,
which means you're sick enough...

29:52.463 --> 29:54.761
...to be on the national UNOS
waiting list...

29:54.966 --> 29:57.901
...but not sick enough to be admitted
into the hospital...

29:58.102 --> 30:00.297
...and placed on Status 1.

30:00.504 --> 30:04.702
So basically, if your heart starts to fail
quickly and no donor can be located...

30:06.210 --> 30:08.110
...you're screwed.

30:10.047 --> 30:13.483
Is it true that you said...

30:13.684 --> 30:16.619
...that you do not believe
that you even deserve a heart...

30:16.821 --> 30:21.986
...because your life is unremarkable
in every way?

30:27.131 --> 30:28.758
I'm sorry.

30:35.339 --> 30:39.275
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.

30:39.477 --> 30:42.640
Do you have to take any type
of sensitivity training...

30:42.847 --> 30:44.280
...to join the IRS, Mr. Thomas?

30:44.482 --> 30:47.815
- No, not really.
- Yeah.

30:49.854 --> 30:52.721
So you don't consider yourself
a good person?

30:53.691 --> 30:57.218
How would you answer that question
if I asked you the same?

31:01.899 --> 31:06.962
"Unremarkable" would be
an upgrade for me...

31:07.171 --> 31:09.002
...I assure you.

31:12.910 --> 31:18.007
I'm gonna freeze your accounts
as uncollectible until further notice.

31:18.616 --> 31:22.143
I'm sure that'll buy you
five or six months, penalty-free.

31:27.925 --> 31:29.654
Here's my card.

31:29.860 --> 31:33.296
If anyone from the IRS
tries to contact you...

31:33.497 --> 31:35.624
...you call me immediately.

31:35.833 --> 31:37.323
Okay.

31:38.402 --> 31:40.063
Thank you.

31:40.671 --> 31:42.536
Thank you.

31:44.875 --> 31:46.502
Okay.

31:50.314 --> 31:52.839
- Mr. Thomas?
- Yes.

32:03.961 --> 32:08.728
Why do I get the feeling you're
doing me a really big favor right now?

32:11.735 --> 32:15.967
Because I get the feeling
that you really deserve it.

32:19.276 --> 32:20.834
All right?

32:26.884 --> 32:28.715
You off to?

32:29.987 --> 32:32.683
You off to pollute
someone else's dog now?

32:34.825 --> 32:36.452
No.

32:38.662 --> 32:40.254
Just going home.

32:40.865 --> 32:42.992
Where's that?

32:52.510 --> 32:54.410
Take care, Emily.

32:55.746 --> 32:57.304
You too.

34:31.442 --> 34:34.969
- What is this thing for?
- I told you already.

34:35.179 --> 34:37.579
And why are you bringing a fish
into your room?

34:37.781 --> 34:39.840
Because it's my room.

34:40.583 --> 34:43.485
And I don't want anyone going
into my room, understood?

34:43.687 --> 34:46.087
Well, I don't think you can
keep a fish in your room.

34:46.290 --> 34:48.349
I think I can.

34:48.559 --> 34:51.995
Well, I've never had anybody
who kept a fish in their room.

34:52.196 --> 34:53.686
Now you do.

34:53.897 --> 34:55.330
Who?

34:55.532 --> 34:57.056
Good night.

35:13.617 --> 35:17.075
<i>The first time I ever saw</i>
<i>a box jellyfish...</i>

35:19.156 --> 35:20.953
<i>... I was 12.</i>

35:26.397 --> 35:31.130
<i>Our father took us</i>
<i>to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.</i>

35:34.038 --> 35:36.563
<i>I never forgot when he said...</i>

35:36.774 --> 35:41.677
<i>... that it was the most</i>
<i>deadly creature on earth.</i>

35:45.416 --> 35:47.407
<i>To me it was just...</i>

35:48.319 --> 35:51.345
<i>... the most beautiful thing</i>
<i>I'd ever seen.</i>

35:59.897 --> 36:01.159
I spoke to the doctor again.

36:01.365 --> 36:04.596
He's gonna send over your files
in the morning.

36:06.403 --> 36:09.702
- Is this everything?
- Yeah.

36:10.874 --> 36:13.308
- Any questions?
- Same one.

36:13.510 --> 36:14.943
Well, same answer, then.

36:15.746 --> 36:18.476
You know, I was thinking last night
about when we were 14...

36:18.682 --> 36:21.742
...and we made our big pact.

36:21.952 --> 36:25.115
You remember on the beach
in front of your grandparents' house...

36:25.322 --> 36:30.919
...we agreed that we would never,
never date each other's girls?

36:32.196 --> 36:36.292
I remembered that that night you told
me how much you liked Stacy Miller...

36:36.500 --> 36:39.298
...and that you were gonna
ask her out. And I said:

36:39.503 --> 36:44.167
"Hey, man. You can't.
Her and I already did it."

36:44.375 --> 36:45.967
Which we didn't, but I wanted to...

36:46.176 --> 36:51.045
...but she liked you way more
than she liked me, and...

36:51.248 --> 36:53.273
So I lied to you
because I was so jealous.

36:53.984 --> 36:58.011
And I realized that I've been
carrying around this lie...

36:58.222 --> 37:00.452
...in my heart for the last 25...

37:00.657 --> 37:01.988
Stop it!

37:03.794 --> 37:05.455
Stop it.

37:06.563 --> 37:08.656
Stay focused.

37:10.300 --> 37:11.494
Do what you promised me.

37:12.202 --> 37:15.899
- What, you think I'm...?
- Do what you promised me.

37:18.375 --> 37:21.674
You think I'm gonna
let you down now, don't you?

37:21.879 --> 37:24.905
I've known you my whole damn life!

37:25.115 --> 37:26.207
Okay?

37:26.417 --> 37:29.818
This? This? This is not something
you do every day.

37:30.921 --> 37:34.357
Okay? This is...
This is not easy for me.

37:35.726 --> 37:38.559
I'll make sure everything goes
as planned.

37:45.269 --> 37:46.361
Don't worry.

37:50.073 --> 37:51.665
Thank you.

38:17.935 --> 38:20.927
Oh, my God.

38:21.138 --> 38:22.696
Hello, Holly.

38:23.307 --> 38:24.831
Look at you.

38:28.779 --> 38:31.873
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

38:32.082 --> 38:34.209
- Really?
- You have a minute?

38:34.418 --> 38:36.818
Sure. Come on in.

38:37.020 --> 38:39.955
Here's my desk. Have a seat.

38:51.969 --> 38:52.958
You look great.

38:53.170 --> 38:54.899
- I do?
- Yes.

38:55.105 --> 38:57.096
I feel great.

38:57.307 --> 39:00.765
- How are you?
- I'm really good.

39:01.678 --> 39:03.111
I need a favor.

39:03.313 --> 39:07.113
Whatever you need, just ask me.

39:07.918 --> 39:10.648
I need a name.
Someone in the system.

39:10.854 --> 39:13.880
Someone having
a really hard time...

39:14.091 --> 39:17.720
...that needs help, but may be
too proud to ask for a handout.

39:21.532 --> 39:23.500
What are you doing?

39:25.402 --> 39:27.336
I'm helping.

39:31.074 --> 39:32.905
I need a name.

39:36.013 --> 39:38.140
Okay.

39:39.716 --> 39:41.980
<i>Connie Tepos.</i>

39:42.185 --> 39:46.554
<i>Her boyfriend almost killed her</i>
<i>last year when she tried to leave.</i>

39:47.391 --> 39:50.918
<i>He broke three of her ribs</i>
<i>last month.</i>

39:51.628 --> 39:53.994
<i>She's scared to death</i>
<i>to press charges...</i>

39:54.197 --> 39:56.256
<i>... and we can't do anything.</i>

40:08.145 --> 40:09.874
- Hello.
- Hi.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.310
- Connie Tepos?
- Yes?

40:12.516 --> 40:15.644
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS.

40:15.852 --> 40:18.013
IRS? But I always pay my taxes.

40:18.221 --> 40:21.884
Yes, this is more of
a general inquiry.

40:22.092 --> 40:24.458
I don't understand. What...?

40:25.796 --> 40:26.956
May I come in?

40:27.164 --> 40:30.133
Not now. My boyfriend is not here.

40:30.334 --> 40:33.360
It's very important for your family.

40:34.171 --> 40:35.798
For my family?

40:47.851 --> 40:49.580
Beautiful.

40:50.854 --> 40:54.085
Please, have a seat.

40:57.027 --> 40:58.392
What's this all about?

41:00.163 --> 41:02.597
Your case has come to my attention.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.732
And I wanted to get to know you.

41:06.403 --> 41:08.871
You wanted to get to know me?
Why?

41:10.540 --> 41:12.405
Because I'd like to help you.

41:13.310 --> 41:14.402
I don't understand.

41:19.016 --> 41:21.610
I'm aware of your case.

41:22.285 --> 41:23.650
And your boyfriend.

41:23.854 --> 41:25.788
What are you talking about?

41:28.492 --> 41:30.960
You know what I'm talking about.

41:31.161 --> 41:33.789
No, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

41:35.932 --> 41:38.594
Kids, go to your room.

41:39.369 --> 41:40.836
He's coming back?

41:41.038 --> 41:43.836
He's not coming back.

41:55.085 --> 41:57.576
You said you were from the IRS,
but you're lying to me.

41:57.788 --> 41:59.483
- No.
- You're not telling me the truth.

41:59.690 --> 42:00.918
Who sent you here?

42:01.124 --> 42:02.751
Please sit down.

42:02.959 --> 42:04.426
I'm not going to sit down.

42:04.628 --> 42:07.392
- Please, calm down.
- I'm not going to calm down.

42:07.597 --> 42:08.825
You come into my house.

42:09.032 --> 42:11.830
You talking to me
about <i>mi caso y mi</i> boyfriend?

42:12.035 --> 42:15.095
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.

42:16.073 --> 42:18.007
Nobody?
Get out of my house immediately.

42:20.077 --> 42:21.203
You can trust me.

42:21.411 --> 42:23.606
I trust no one, Mr. Thomas.

42:23.814 --> 42:25.179
I talked to Holly.

42:26.616 --> 42:28.982
I can get you out of here.

42:29.186 --> 42:34.089
To a safe place. A beautiful place.

42:34.291 --> 42:36.816
Why did you talk to Holly?

42:37.027 --> 42:38.517
Your children are in danger here.

42:38.729 --> 42:40.526
Don't talk about my kids,
Mr. Thomas.

42:40.731 --> 42:43.700
- You don't know.
- You don't have to live like this.

42:43.900 --> 42:46.494
Get out of my house now
or I'm gonna call the police.

42:46.703 --> 42:48.330
- Okay, okay.
- Who are you?

42:48.538 --> 42:50.836
- I want you to take my card.
- I don't need help.

42:51.041 --> 42:52.872
I want you to take my card,
and call me...

42:53.076 --> 42:54.771
- I don't need it.
- I'm gonna leave it.

42:54.978 --> 42:56.741
Okay. Thank you. Get out right now.

42:56.947 --> 43:00.144
- You're not helpless.
- Can you leave? This is my house.

43:00.350 --> 43:02.215
Please, just think about it.

43:04.421 --> 43:06.389
I don't need you.

43:24.841 --> 43:27.366
- I can't talk right now.
- <i>I need to talk immediately.</i>

43:27.577 --> 43:28.908
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I'm nowhere.

43:29.112 --> 43:30.739
I'm gonna meet you at the house.

43:30.947 --> 43:35.008
Look, no. I'm not at the house.
I'm traveling. I'll talk to you next week.

43:35.218 --> 43:38.244
No, no, no. We need to
discuss this right now.

44:30.440 --> 44:33.307
Wouldn't wanna get
on her bad side.

44:33.510 --> 44:36.001
- I'll sign to that.
- Yeah.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.313
How you doing, you two?

44:38.515 --> 44:40.142
I'm good.

44:41.051 --> 44:42.313
Got a big day.

44:42.519 --> 44:45.386
Yep. No more dialysis, George.
See you in the O.R.

44:45.589 --> 44:47.147
Yep.

44:47.991 --> 44:49.720
- I'll see you there as well.
- Yes, sir.

44:49.926 --> 44:51.416
Thank you.

44:53.230 --> 44:54.959
So I heard you raised
enough money...

44:55.165 --> 44:58.157
...to give a couple of the kids
partial scholarships to college.

44:58.368 --> 45:00.302
It's no big deal.

45:00.503 --> 45:02.630
I just convinced a couple
of bigwig donors...

45:02.839 --> 45:06.570
...that what the world really needs
to see is more Latinos on ice.

45:10.747 --> 45:14.114
You know, Ben,
I keep asking you this...

45:14.317 --> 45:17.411
...but why me?

45:19.256 --> 45:23.158
Because you are a good man.

45:23.360 --> 45:25.920
No, really.

45:27.197 --> 45:31.600
Even when you don't know
that people are watching you.

45:43.513 --> 45:45.344
<i>Hello?</i>

45:46.182 --> 45:47.911
Hello?

45:49.185 --> 45:50.482
Hello?

45:53.990 --> 45:56.959
<i>Okay, I can't hear you,</i>
<i>so try back again.</i>

45:57.994 --> 45:59.962
Gonna hang up now.

46:00.897 --> 46:02.660
Bye.

46:14.744 --> 46:16.473
Mr. Thomas?

46:16.680 --> 46:18.614
We're ready for you.

47:46.403 --> 47:48.963
These are beautiful.

47:49.172 --> 47:52.107
Banana peels. Who knew?

48:19.135 --> 48:20.693
Emily?

49:56.933 --> 49:58.833
Can I get a refill?

50:01.938 --> 50:04.236
- Susan?
- Yeah.

50:04.440 --> 50:05.532
How's Ryan?

50:06.009 --> 50:08.978
He's good. He's at his dad's
this weekend.

50:09.179 --> 50:15.607
Will you tell him for me that I'm ready
whenever he is for a free lesson?

50:15.818 --> 50:16.910
Yeah, all right.

50:17.120 --> 50:19.384
Things are kind of crazy right now
with school...

50:19.589 --> 50:21.386
...but maybe when school's out.

50:21.591 --> 50:24.219
Oh, yeah. That's perfect.

50:49.886 --> 50:51.945
How's the pie?

50:52.155 --> 50:54.988
Oh, it's... It's good.

50:55.191 --> 50:57.216
You gonna ask her out?

50:58.428 --> 50:59.861
The waitress.

51:03.433 --> 51:04.866
No.

51:05.435 --> 51:06.766
You never know.

51:08.938 --> 51:12.430
I don't... I don't think she sees me.

51:14.844 --> 51:16.277
Good night, Ezra.

51:54.584 --> 51:55.881
Hello?

51:57.787 --> 51:59.311
Ben?

52:00.323 --> 52:02.348
Hi, I'm sorry to call so late.

52:05.495 --> 52:09.090
Did...? Did someone
from the IRS contact you?

52:09.299 --> 52:11.096
No.

52:11.301 --> 52:12.928
I just...

52:13.936 --> 52:18.202
I was having trouble breathing after
I took Duke for a walk, and I fainted.

52:18.975 --> 52:21.773
<i>An ambulance had to take me</i>
<i>to the hospital.</i>

52:23.780 --> 52:24.940
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

52:25.148 --> 52:27.207
I don't know why I even
called you. I'm sorry.

52:27.417 --> 52:30.875
It's just that I have your card
with me, and...

52:34.957 --> 52:36.117
Ben?

52:39.362 --> 52:41.023
Are you still there?

52:41.998 --> 52:43.488
Yes.

52:47.103 --> 52:49.367
Do you ever
think about dying, Ben?

52:51.674 --> 52:53.471
Every now and again.

52:55.311 --> 52:58.280
My face is bluish.

52:58.481 --> 53:01.450
It's not exactly a good sign.

53:01.651 --> 53:04.142
You should try to rest. Just...

53:04.354 --> 53:07.084
Why don't you see
if you can get some sleep?

53:07.957 --> 53:10.152
I like talking to you.

53:10.360 --> 53:12.487
<i>I like talking to you too.</i>

53:15.732 --> 53:18.166
Would you tell me a story, please?

53:22.472 --> 53:24.099
Okay.

53:26.976 --> 53:29.968
All right. Once upon a time...

53:30.179 --> 53:34.138
<i>... there was a little boy named...</i>

53:34.350 --> 53:38.548
Oh, lucky me, you just got it
on reserve like that. Okay.

53:39.756 --> 53:41.849
Let me guess. His name was Ben.

53:44.160 --> 53:48.221
No, actually,
this little boy's name is Tim.

53:48.431 --> 53:50.797
I like the name Tim.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.797
Go on.

53:53.002 --> 53:55.368
<i>Tim's little brother</i>
<i>was always pestering Tim...</i>

53:55.571 --> 54:01.009
...to make him paper airplanes,
because he was really good at it.

54:01.210 --> 54:04.509
But Tim had much bigger
dreams than that.

54:04.714 --> 54:07.376
Okay. Then what happened?

54:08.117 --> 54:10.415
One day, Tim went out
to the backyard...

54:10.620 --> 54:15.421
...and he put leaves
and taped branches to his arms...

54:15.625 --> 54:17.684
...and started climbing
the big oak tree.

54:17.894 --> 54:21.591
<i>His little brother said,</i>
<i>"Tim, you can't fly."</i>

54:21.798 --> 54:24.164
<i>And he said,</i>
<i>"Yeah? You just watch."</i>

54:24.367 --> 54:28.497
He got all the way to the top
and jumped.

54:30.339 --> 54:33.308
How tall was this tree?

54:33.876 --> 54:36.743
<i>It was... It was pretty tall.</i>
<i>He broke his arm.</i>

54:36.946 --> 54:39.574
Oh, my God...
This is a horrible story.

54:39.782 --> 54:41.215
Oh, no, no. It gets better.

54:41.417 --> 54:47.049
From that experience,
Tim realized that he wanted to fly.

54:47.723 --> 54:51.318
So he dedicated his life
to making spaceships.

54:51.527 --> 54:54.155
I thought you said
this was a good story.

54:55.598 --> 54:57.361
Oh, well...

54:58.067 --> 54:59.762
Yeah, that is...

55:00.670 --> 55:04.037
...until the dragons showed up.

55:04.640 --> 55:08.132
Oh, okay, see,
now it's getting better.

55:08.344 --> 55:11.609
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.

55:11.814 --> 55:16.376
Yes, and these were fire-breathing
space dragons...

55:16.586 --> 55:19.248
<i>... with really bad attitudes.</i>

55:20.156 --> 55:22.181
I see.

55:23.759 --> 55:25.021
I have an idea.

55:25.628 --> 55:27.596
<i>Why don't you try to fall asleep...</i>

55:27.797 --> 55:31.631
<i>... and when you do,</i>
<i>I'll just hang up.</i>

55:33.703 --> 55:35.466
Okay.

55:37.039 --> 55:38.028
Ben?

55:39.175 --> 55:40.608
Yes.

55:42.445 --> 55:45.243
Thank you for listening.

55:45.448 --> 55:47.348
And for talking.

55:49.485 --> 55:51.544
<i>Try to fall asleep.</i>

55:56.826 --> 55:58.589
Good night, Ben.

55:59.795 --> 56:01.558
Good night, Emily.

56:07.870 --> 56:09.701
Emily?

56:16.612 --> 56:18.079
Emily?

57:11.033 --> 57:13.024
I lied to you.

57:15.404 --> 57:18.032
I think about dying every day.

57:27.383 --> 57:32.411
<i>Dr. King to NICU. Dr. Wesley King,</i>
<i>please report to NICU.</i>

58:14.664 --> 58:16.222
Hey.

58:20.936 --> 58:23.404
- Hey.
- Hey.

58:25.041 --> 58:26.474
When did you get here?

58:29.578 --> 58:31.910
Last night, after we talked.

58:33.516 --> 58:35.074
You slept here?

58:37.219 --> 58:39.710
Good morning. How's our patient?

58:39.922 --> 58:41.947
- Morning. Better.
- Good.

58:42.158 --> 58:44.991
- Hello.
- Hi, Ben. Is that right? IRS?

58:45.194 --> 58:46.889
- Yes, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

58:47.096 --> 58:50.122
- I'll leave you two alone.
- No, no, stay, please. Don't go.

58:50.332 --> 58:51.959
He can... He can stay.

58:52.168 --> 58:54.033
Whatever you want.

58:56.405 --> 58:58.464
You fainted because
your heart was too weak...

58:58.674 --> 59:00.437
...to pump enough blood
to your brain.

59:00.643 --> 59:03.578
It's enlarged
and it's starting to shut down.

59:04.413 --> 59:05.641
How long?

59:06.348 --> 59:08.339
It's entirely up to your heart.

59:08.551 --> 59:12.419
Could be six weeks,
could be a month.

59:13.122 --> 59:15.613
But we've upped you to Status 1 B.

59:17.593 --> 59:18.992
At least I'm on the list.

59:19.528 --> 59:23.988
Not only that,
but we're giving you this pager.

59:24.200 --> 59:27.897
And when it goes off,
it means you have a donor.

59:31.874 --> 59:34.001
The inotrope drug I started you on...

59:34.210 --> 59:37.338
...it's gonna stabilize your
blood pressure within 24 hours.

59:38.481 --> 59:39.971
Then what?

59:40.182 --> 59:42.173
We wait.

59:42.785 --> 59:46.277
- Can I do that at home?
- Once you're stable, you can.

59:46.956 --> 59:48.480
Okay.

01:00:00.002 --> 01:00:04.871
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.

01:00:05.074 --> 01:00:08.475
If you want something else,
I can get you something else.

01:00:12.448 --> 01:00:14.439
Would you stay?

01:00:17.353 --> 01:00:20.015
I mean, unless you have
something else to do.

01:00:23.058 --> 01:00:27.358
- I'd really like it if you stayed.
- I don't have anything.

01:00:29.398 --> 01:00:31.923
Okay. Okay.

01:00:48.083 --> 01:00:50.313
Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is that thing?

01:00:50.519 --> 01:00:52.544
It's a dog. Just for one night.

01:00:52.755 --> 01:00:55.246
No. Hold on, hold on.
I don't give two shits, okay?

01:00:55.457 --> 01:00:56.981
We have a dog policy here.

01:00:57.193 --> 01:00:59.787
Little dogs only.
Poodles and Shih Tzus.

01:00:59.995 --> 01:01:03.328
It's in the contract. It's English
and Spanish for everyone to see.

01:01:03.532 --> 01:01:06.126
And besides, that, my friend,
is not a dog.

01:01:06.335 --> 01:01:08.326
It's a goddamn horse.

01:01:08.537 --> 01:01:12.371
Well, let me know when you add
a horse policy to the contract.

01:01:39.401 --> 01:01:40.390
Yes.

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:43.297
Mr. Thomas, it's Connie Tepos.

01:01:44.373 --> 01:01:45.738
Hey, Connie.

01:01:45.941 --> 01:01:48.466
<i>I don't know why I'm calling you...</i>

01:01:48.677 --> 01:01:50.941
...but I'm calling you.

01:01:51.947 --> 01:01:53.938
You said you could help us and...

01:01:54.149 --> 01:01:56.481
Can you really help us?

01:01:57.319 --> 01:01:59.719
This just doesn't make any sense.

01:02:00.322 --> 01:02:02.620
- What if he finds us?
- He won't.

01:02:02.825 --> 01:02:04.315
- What makes you so sure?
- Stop it.

01:02:04.526 --> 01:02:06.892
- You don't know him.
- Stop it.

01:02:07.096 --> 01:02:09.462
Don't be weak.

01:02:09.665 --> 01:02:13.294
- Don't be weak.
- I'm not weak.

01:02:15.471 --> 01:02:17.803
I'm strong.

01:02:19.408 --> 01:02:22.400
Take this. Take it.

01:02:24.346 --> 01:02:26.678
You are gonna start this car...

01:02:27.783 --> 01:02:29.751
...and you're gonna go.

01:02:30.719 --> 01:02:34.985
This is real,
and this is gonna be your new life.

01:02:36.025 --> 01:02:38.823
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

01:02:39.028 --> 01:02:42.361
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.

01:02:42.564 --> 01:02:44.361
Look how beautiful
those babies are.

01:02:44.566 --> 01:02:46.898
I know, I know.

01:02:48.003 --> 01:02:49.834
They deserve it.

01:02:51.807 --> 01:02:53.638
Okay?

01:02:55.311 --> 01:02:58.747
<i>You're headed north up the coast.</i>

01:03:22.204 --> 01:03:24.229
Lorena. Lorena.

01:03:25.474 --> 01:03:29.706
<i>I've always believed</i>
<i>this place can heal the soul.</i>

01:03:34.416 --> 01:03:35.883
Mommy, the ocean.

01:03:36.085 --> 01:03:37.814
Yes, the ocean.

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:40.511
<i>I hope that proves true for you.</i>

01:04:00.342 --> 01:04:04.039
<i>When you sign your name</i>
<i>on the dotted line of the contract...</i>

01:04:04.246 --> 01:04:06.806
<i>... you'll own my house outright.</i>

01:04:09.818 --> 01:04:12.446
<i>I only ask that you never mention</i>
<i>how you got the house...</i>

01:04:12.654 --> 01:04:16.283
<i>... or try to contact me</i>
<i>for any reason.</i>

01:04:20.662 --> 01:04:24.496
<i>And if you're wondering why you,</i>
<i>please stop.</i>

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.003
<i>All I ask is for you</i>
<i>to honor my wishes...</i>

01:04:37.146 --> 01:04:41.981
<i>... and, of course,</i>
<i>live life abundantly.</i>

01:04:54.363 --> 01:04:56.991
Hey. Thanks. Got it.

01:04:57.199 --> 01:04:58.996
Hi, Duke.

01:04:59.201 --> 01:05:01.226
Hi, baby.

01:05:02.271 --> 01:05:04.466
What time does the nurse come?

01:05:04.673 --> 01:05:07.506
She should be there
by the time I get home.

01:05:10.746 --> 01:05:13.044
- Ben?
- Yes.

01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:17.642
I know I'm the girl
with the broken wing.

01:05:18.821 --> 01:05:21.119
But who are you?

01:05:21.690 --> 01:05:22.918
Who am I?

01:05:23.125 --> 01:05:26.117
I am your friendly neighborhood
tax collector.

01:05:26.328 --> 01:05:27.818
Ben.

01:05:29.298 --> 01:05:31.858
Where the hell did you come from?

01:05:34.636 --> 01:05:37.696
I grew up in Oakland.

01:05:38.941 --> 01:05:41.171
Literally. Okay.

01:05:43.112 --> 01:05:45.342
Where did you go to college?

01:05:45.547 --> 01:05:48.744
As far from Oakland as possible.

01:05:49.184 --> 01:05:52.210
Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.

01:05:52.421 --> 01:05:54.184
How about you?

01:05:54.389 --> 01:05:56.357
UCLA.

01:05:57.626 --> 01:05:59.958
You went to MIT?

01:06:00.762 --> 01:06:03.526
Like, the MIT?

01:06:06.301 --> 01:06:12.171
Oh, and now you're wondering how
I wound up as a lowly tax collector.

01:06:12.374 --> 01:06:14.205
Absolutely.

01:06:19.181 --> 01:06:24.141
- I sort of stumbled into this job.
- That's a big stumble.

01:06:24.953 --> 01:06:26.614
What from?

01:06:28.323 --> 01:06:30.621
I always wanted to be an engineer.

01:06:31.593 --> 01:06:33.618
An engineer?

01:06:35.497 --> 01:06:37.226
What kind?

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.896
The kind that sent people
to the moon.

01:06:42.237 --> 01:06:43.704
Really?

01:06:44.239 --> 01:06:45.297
Yes.

01:06:45.507 --> 01:06:48.738
I don't wanna talk
about me anymore.

01:06:50.012 --> 01:06:54.176
That's too bad,
because you're very interesting.

01:07:02.491 --> 01:07:04.152
Have you...?

01:07:05.494 --> 01:07:07.485
Have you ever been in love?

01:07:08.897 --> 01:07:10.888
Emily, please.

01:07:11.667 --> 01:07:13.658
Yes, you have.

01:07:13.869 --> 01:07:15.234
Come on, you can tell me.

01:07:19.942 --> 01:07:21.671
Yes.

01:07:22.044 --> 01:07:24.342
But it ended.

01:07:25.314 --> 01:07:28.078
- What happened?
- Stop it.

01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:30.777
- No, seriously, you can tell...
- Stop it.

01:07:33.121 --> 01:07:35.783
You need to get some rest.

01:07:36.525 --> 01:07:40.859
I'll call you tomorrow,
or maybe I'll stop by.

01:07:43.699 --> 01:07:47.066
No, if I have questions tomorrow,
what then?

01:07:48.904 --> 01:07:51.168
That's not a part of the deal.

01:07:52.774 --> 01:07:54.833
What the hell does that mean?

01:08:15.564 --> 01:08:18.658
Emily, hold on. Hold on.

01:08:18.867 --> 01:08:21.893
- Just leave.
- Emily, wait.

01:08:22.104 --> 01:08:23.537
Wait!

01:08:34.249 --> 01:08:36.615
Thank you for everything you did.

01:09:10.018 --> 01:09:11.645
Did you like the eggs?

01:09:11.853 --> 01:09:13.821
They were okay, I guess.

01:09:14.022 --> 01:09:16.319
I don't like the eggs you buy.

01:09:17.859 --> 01:09:19.486
Okay.

01:09:47.421 --> 01:09:49.754
You're wearing suit pants.

01:09:50.692 --> 01:09:52.283
To weed.

01:09:52.493 --> 01:09:56.555
Yeah, I didn't... I didn't have
any other clothes with me.

01:09:57.165 --> 01:10:00.100
- You know, I was gonna get to those.
- I saw them the other day.

01:10:00.302 --> 01:10:04.898
I figured I would just take the day off
and get this done for you.

01:10:07.976 --> 01:10:09.307
Ben?

01:10:09.511 --> 01:10:10.773
Yeah?

01:10:10.979 --> 01:10:13.812
This is a really ridiculous apology.

01:10:19.755 --> 01:10:23.350
Come on.
I wanna show you something.

01:10:23.558 --> 01:10:25.423
Oh, no, I gotta finish.

01:10:27.396 --> 01:10:29.421
You can finish tomorrow.

01:10:30.966 --> 01:10:32.593
Come on.

01:10:47.549 --> 01:10:49.107
This is where I used to work.

01:10:50.485 --> 01:10:53.386
And these are the artifacts
of said work.

01:10:53.989 --> 01:10:56.651
Wow, those are great.
How old are they?

01:10:58.326 --> 01:11:03.696
This one is just shy of 120 years.

01:11:04.232 --> 01:11:09.568
It's how I put out my line of letterpress
cards, wedding invitations, invites.

01:11:09.771 --> 01:11:11.534
What about this one?

01:11:12.073 --> 01:11:13.938
That youngster...

01:11:14.142 --> 01:11:18.909
...is the Heidelberg Windmill, 1956.

01:11:19.448 --> 01:11:21.313
Call it "The Beast."

01:11:22.017 --> 01:11:24.383
Well, that seems appropriate.

01:11:24.853 --> 01:11:27.378
It pooped out on me
about five years ago, though.

01:11:27.589 --> 01:11:30.183
And I can't find anybody to fix it.

01:11:30.392 --> 01:11:32.826
It's kind of a dying art.

01:11:33.028 --> 01:11:35.588
Defibrillator here works, though.

01:11:35.797 --> 01:11:38.197
Luckily. It kept my business afloat.
Wanna see how?

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.061
Please.

01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:44.002
Okay. Now, true pressmen...

01:11:44.206 --> 01:11:47.573
...hate that we modern girls...

01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:50.508
...want a deep impression.

01:11:50.712 --> 01:11:55.172
See, for a hundred years, they tried
their damnedest just to kiss it...

01:11:55.584 --> 01:11:58.781
...so that it didn't leave
an indentation.

01:11:59.788 --> 01:12:03.224
Now it's the only way
to prove it's not digital.

01:12:08.163 --> 01:12:10.597
I think it feels richer.

01:12:12.968 --> 01:12:14.697
You okay?

01:12:15.103 --> 01:12:16.832
Yeah.

01:12:18.273 --> 01:12:20.264
Look, Ben...

01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:27.410
I don't really know anything about you
or where you came from...

01:12:28.817 --> 01:12:30.944
...but you keep showing up.

01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:35.952
And I'm glad.

01:12:37.726 --> 01:12:39.353
Okay.

01:12:41.062 --> 01:12:42.996
Okay.

01:12:43.198 --> 01:12:46.463
So Duke needs a walk.

01:12:46.668 --> 01:12:48.363
Are you interested?

01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:50.765
Yes.

01:13:02.517 --> 01:13:04.109
Come on.

01:13:05.887 --> 01:13:07.752
Hey, hey.

01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:10.417
Right here.

01:13:10.625 --> 01:13:12.354
There you go.

01:13:12.961 --> 01:13:15.930
He's like a different dog
with you around.

01:13:16.498 --> 01:13:19.262
I don't think we ever
properly bonded.

01:13:20.735 --> 01:13:22.965
Why would you get such a big dog?

01:13:27.208 --> 01:13:33.044
Did you know that Great Danes on
average only live about seven years?

01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:37.084
They have heart issues.

01:13:39.688 --> 01:13:42.020
I think I got him because...

01:13:42.657 --> 01:13:45.217
...I thought he could help me
with my illness.

01:13:46.094 --> 01:13:48.028
It'd be something
I could take care of...

01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:50.891
...as opposed to being
always taken care of.

01:13:55.303 --> 01:13:58.670
You know, just so you know,
I used to be really hot.

01:14:00.642 --> 01:14:03.509
Like, unauditably hot.

01:14:04.112 --> 01:14:06.046
Is that so?

01:14:06.247 --> 01:14:07.737
Yeah.

01:14:14.823 --> 01:14:17.849
I haven't felt like this
in a really long time.

01:14:27.702 --> 01:14:30.296
There's so many things
that I wanna do.

01:14:33.575 --> 01:14:35.509
I wanna go on a plane
for 13 hours...

01:14:35.710 --> 01:14:39.237
...and not have to stress
that I can't reach my doctor.

01:14:41.016 --> 01:14:45.715
You know, like, just travel.
Go backpacking, have experiences.

01:14:46.521 --> 01:14:48.614
See the world.

01:14:50.158 --> 01:14:55.095
I just wanna have the time
to figure out who it is that I am.

01:14:55.296 --> 01:14:57.491
You know, what I like.

01:15:00.201 --> 01:15:03.364
Do things, try things,
get out of my head for once.

01:15:07.942 --> 01:15:11.173
I would really like to go running.

01:15:13.048 --> 01:15:14.345
I think about that sometimes.

01:15:14.549 --> 01:15:18.815
What it would just feel like
to go running.

01:15:53.688 --> 01:15:55.383
So...

01:15:56.458 --> 01:15:57.982
...see you tomorrow?

01:15:59.461 --> 01:16:01.019
Yes.

01:16:02.197 --> 01:16:07.134
But if you need anything,
just call and I'll come right back.

01:16:08.303 --> 01:16:09.861
Okay.

01:16:17.145 --> 01:16:18.635
Bye.

01:16:30.125 --> 01:16:31.990
I had a really great time today.

01:16:32.494 --> 01:16:34.257
Me too.

01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:37.357
Bye.

01:20:47.682 --> 01:20:50.674
No anesthetic. You ever
donated bone marrow before?

01:20:50.885 --> 01:20:52.750
You're a brave guy.

01:20:55.523 --> 01:20:57.855
How long have you
known Nicholas?

01:21:07.668 --> 01:21:09.659
What the hell happened to you?

01:21:11.672 --> 01:21:14.664
Hey, how much longer
are you gonna stay in my hotel?

01:21:14.876 --> 01:21:16.070
Motel.

01:21:16.277 --> 01:21:18.142
How much longer?

01:21:19.113 --> 01:21:22.082
Actually, I was planning
on dying here.

01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:25.212
Well, then you need to pay
in advance.

01:22:17.138 --> 01:22:18.196
Hello?

01:22:20.274 --> 01:22:21.832
Hey, it's Emily.

01:22:22.043 --> 01:22:23.567
Are you sleeping?

01:22:26.013 --> 01:22:28.573
Yes. No.

01:22:29.817 --> 01:22:31.250
Is everything okay?

01:22:32.353 --> 01:22:34.378
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:22:35.623 --> 01:22:38.649
My sister came over for a couple
of days last week with the kids...

01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:41.328
...and it was really great.

01:22:42.663 --> 01:22:45.393
<i>I tried calling you a couple times.</i>

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.124
<i>How are you doing?</i>

01:22:47.335 --> 01:22:49.132
Yeah, I'm good.

01:22:49.337 --> 01:22:52.306
Everything's fine. I've been...

01:22:52.874 --> 01:22:56.708
I've been traveling a lot, so...

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:01.614
Well, are you busy tonight?

01:23:03.417 --> 01:23:04.714
What do you mean?

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:09.513
I don't... Maybe you wanna
come by and say hello?

01:23:09.724 --> 01:23:11.555
Around 7?

01:23:13.127 --> 01:23:16.255
<i>You don't have to if you don't want to.</i>
<i>I just, you know...</i>

01:23:20.368 --> 01:23:24.361
Look, I totally get if you don't wanna
hang out with the dying girl, so...

01:23:25.706 --> 01:23:28.834
I can... I can come at 7.

01:23:30.411 --> 01:23:32.311
Okay.

01:23:33.414 --> 01:23:34.881
Okay.

01:23:36.384 --> 01:23:37.942
Bye.

01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:25.857
- Well, how you doing tonight?
- Hey.

01:24:26.067 --> 01:24:28.592
- How you doing?
- Have fun.

01:24:29.437 --> 01:24:30.597
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:24:31.806 --> 01:24:33.433
Come in.

01:24:33.641 --> 01:24:35.905
I am so glad she's gone.

01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:37.805
Are you okay if we eat outside?

01:24:38.212 --> 01:24:39.270
Eating?

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:40.913
You didn't eat already, did you?

01:24:41.115 --> 01:24:43.276
- No.
- Okay.

01:24:45.486 --> 01:24:46.510
No.

01:24:46.721 --> 01:24:49.918
Well, it was a surprise...

01:24:50.591 --> 01:24:52.422
...but you're on time.

01:24:54.629 --> 01:24:59.965
I haven't cooked anybody food
for years, so you better like it.

01:25:00.167 --> 01:25:02.101
Or lie to me.

01:25:05.006 --> 01:25:06.564
This is for you.

01:25:07.875 --> 01:25:12.278
You don't have to say anything.
I just got it... Change in there.

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:16.007
Dinner is ready and you're not.
So hurry up.

01:25:17.051 --> 01:25:18.780
Chop-chop.

01:26:19.613 --> 01:26:21.308
You look great.

01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:24.413
Yeah. It's pink.

01:26:24.819 --> 01:26:26.616
It's salmon.

01:26:39.567 --> 01:26:41.558
You are so nice.

01:26:43.404 --> 01:26:45.065
So are you.

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.412
Everything's vegetarian.

01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:58.079
I hope you like eggplant Parmesan.

01:27:02.456 --> 01:27:06.187
I haven't treated myself very well...

01:27:06.394 --> 01:27:08.862
...in the past few years.

01:27:11.198 --> 01:27:12.927
Start now.

01:27:20.775 --> 01:27:22.367
All right.

01:27:29.984 --> 01:27:31.451
What do you think?

01:27:36.090 --> 01:27:38.115
It's delicious.

01:27:40.728 --> 01:27:42.525
Glad you like it.

01:28:22.803 --> 01:28:24.998
Do you wanna hear
my favorite song?

01:28:26.106 --> 01:28:28.438
Yes. Are you gonna sing it?

01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:34.839
No, I can't sing anymore.

01:28:35.850 --> 01:28:37.511
Oh, and a performance.

01:28:37.718 --> 01:28:39.583
Oh, no.

01:29:23.097 --> 01:29:24.826
Shall we?

01:29:44.084 --> 01:29:45.779
You need to relax.

01:29:46.787 --> 01:29:48.982
This is relaxed.

01:30:20.821 --> 01:30:23.221
I have a surprise for you.

01:30:25.326 --> 01:30:27.123
Surprise?

01:30:27.928 --> 01:30:29.452
Yes.

01:30:30.230 --> 01:30:31.697
For me?

01:30:34.902 --> 01:30:37.268
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

01:30:44.211 --> 01:30:46.975
And open.

01:30:51.719 --> 01:30:53.118
Okay.

01:31:00.728 --> 01:31:02.753
You cleaned The Beast.

01:31:04.064 --> 01:31:06.498
Actually, I fixed it.

01:31:07.401 --> 01:31:09.130
No, you didn't.

01:31:09.336 --> 01:31:11.065
Oh, okay, let's go, then.

01:31:11.271 --> 01:31:14.240
Wait. Are you serious?

01:31:14.441 --> 01:31:15.965
Try it.

01:31:24.485 --> 01:31:26.043
Okay.

01:32:09.730 --> 01:32:11.425
Thank you.

01:32:51.705 --> 01:32:54.640
Wait right here, okay?

01:32:55.008 --> 01:32:57.499
I'll be right back. Wait right here.

01:33:00.714 --> 01:33:02.113
One second.

01:33:14.027 --> 01:33:15.460
Hey!

01:33:16.563 --> 01:33:18.360
Tell me what's going on.

01:33:18.899 --> 01:33:20.196
- Now!
- All right.

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.527
Ben, you need to go home.

01:33:22.736 --> 01:33:26.672
Do you know they keep a full history of
every inquiry a revenue officer makes?

01:33:26.874 --> 01:33:28.603
- You understand?
- Keep your voice down.

01:33:28.809 --> 01:33:31.937
- Just keep your voice down.
- No. What you are doing is a crime!

01:33:32.146 --> 01:33:34.637
You are impersonating
a federal officer. It's a felony!

01:33:34.848 --> 01:33:36.042
All right. Listen.

01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:39.686
You can't play with people's lives.
Do you understand that?

01:33:39.887 --> 01:33:43.050
All right.
All right, there's a coffee shop.

01:33:43.257 --> 01:33:45.282
There's a coffee shop
near where I'm staying.

01:33:45.492 --> 01:33:48.052
- Tomorrow we'll sit down...
- Where are you staying, Tim?

01:33:48.262 --> 01:33:50.787
Tell me, because I don't know
where my brother lives!

01:33:52.065 --> 01:33:53.657
A motel. Five blocks from here.

01:33:53.867 --> 01:33:56.131
We'll sit down tomorrow morning,
I guarantee it.

01:33:56.336 --> 01:33:59.066
Where are my credentials?
Give me my credentials back.

01:34:05.746 --> 01:34:08.237
Here it is. Here. Here.

01:34:10.017 --> 01:34:11.541
Just go home.

01:34:11.752 --> 01:34:14.880
You have a beautiful family.
Go home and enjoy them.

01:34:15.088 --> 01:34:17.318
Tim, Tim, Tim,
why are you even here?

01:34:17.524 --> 01:34:20.186
Tell me, who is Emily Posa?

01:34:22.930 --> 01:34:24.955
I'll explain everything tomorrow.

01:34:30.604 --> 01:34:32.697
Look, give me your car keys.

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.973
I'm not going anywhere.

01:34:42.716 --> 01:34:44.684
I'm gonna be right here.

01:34:46.119 --> 01:34:50.112
So you remember I love you and...

01:34:51.725 --> 01:34:53.955
Tim, don't make me come knock
on the door, okay?

01:35:20.821 --> 01:35:25.019
I didn't realize how late it was and...

01:35:27.794 --> 01:35:31.662
I have a really long drive,
so I need to go.

01:35:35.369 --> 01:35:37.337
I don't wanna keep lying to you.

01:35:38.572 --> 01:35:41.769
I don't wanna... Wait, Emily.

01:37:42.195 --> 01:37:44.390
Do you wanna play a game?

01:37:46.099 --> 01:37:47.726
What game?

01:37:50.737 --> 01:37:52.671
The "what if" game.

01:37:54.207 --> 01:37:56.903
The "what if" game.

01:37:58.378 --> 01:38:00.243
What if...

01:38:01.782 --> 01:38:03.909
...my pager goes off...

01:38:06.853 --> 01:38:08.878
...and it's a heart...

01:38:10.023 --> 01:38:11.991
...and...

01:38:12.926 --> 01:38:14.723
...it works?

01:38:16.363 --> 01:38:19.059
And my body doesn't reject it?

01:38:21.368 --> 01:38:23.233
And...

01:38:27.741 --> 01:38:30.039
...what if I have time?

01:38:43.523 --> 01:38:45.320
What if?

01:38:50.363 --> 01:38:52.888
What if we have children?

01:38:58.438 --> 01:39:00.770
What if we got married?

01:39:14.721 --> 01:39:16.382
I love you.

01:39:16.590 --> 01:39:18.956
- I love you too.
- I love you.

01:41:14.741 --> 01:41:16.299
Hi.

01:41:16.810 --> 01:41:19.643
Is Dr. Briar on duty tonight?

01:41:20.447 --> 01:41:21.971
She's doing her rounds.

01:41:22.182 --> 01:41:24.946
Can you tell her it's Ben Thomas?

01:41:25.652 --> 01:41:26.641
It's very important.

01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:30.121
- I'll... I'll page her.
- Thank you.

01:41:32.225 --> 01:41:35.160
Dr. Briar to the nurses' station.

01:42:00.754 --> 01:42:02.244
Hey.

01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:06.283
- Is it Emily?
- No, no.

01:42:07.861 --> 01:42:09.522
I'm sorry.

01:42:11.431 --> 01:42:12.830
It's...

01:42:13.199 --> 01:42:14.894
Is there?

01:42:17.203 --> 01:42:18.693
I'm sorry.

01:42:19.239 --> 01:42:23.437
Do you have any more optimism...

01:42:23.643 --> 01:42:26.203
...about Emily...

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:29.144
...than you did the other day?

01:42:29.849 --> 01:42:31.248
Ben...

01:42:32.285 --> 01:42:37.245
...when you're looking for a donor
with a rare blood type...

01:42:38.625 --> 01:42:40.217
...the odds go way down.

01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:42.350
To what?

01:42:43.296 --> 01:42:45.355
They go down. What's the...?

01:42:45.565 --> 01:42:47.556
Give me a percentage.

01:42:48.835 --> 01:42:50.530
Give me a number.

01:42:51.538 --> 01:42:53.768
Three, 5 percent.

01:42:54.874 --> 01:42:57.399
I know. I'm sorry.
I wish the numbers were higher.

01:42:57.610 --> 01:43:00.010
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I do.

01:43:46.059 --> 01:43:47.219
Hello?

01:43:47.927 --> 01:43:49.451
Dan.

01:43:50.397 --> 01:43:52.092
It's time.

01:43:52.799 --> 01:43:54.357
I love you.

01:44:51.090 --> 01:44:53.854
<i>1:38 a.m.</i>

01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:58.158
Hello?

01:44:58.364 --> 01:45:00.195
Ezra.

01:45:02.635 --> 01:45:04.933
My name is Ben Thomas.

01:45:06.673 --> 01:45:09.665
I called you a few weeks ago.
You probably don't remember.

01:45:11.110 --> 01:45:14.045
I do remember.

01:45:14.247 --> 01:45:17.216
<i>I wanna apologize for being</i>
<i>so cruel to you...</i>

01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:19.775
...but I had to be certain.

01:45:20.787 --> 01:45:24.223
I had to be certain
that you were a decent man. Kind.

01:45:24.424 --> 01:45:27.916
- <i>Slow to anger.</i>
- What do you want from me?

01:45:28.928 --> 01:45:31.123
I wanna give you a gift.

01:45:32.232 --> 01:45:35.929
You're gonna be contacted
by a man named Dan Morris.

01:45:36.970 --> 01:45:39.063
<i>You can trust him.</i>

01:45:39.272 --> 01:45:41.570
Was that you at the diner?

01:45:43.476 --> 01:45:44.602
Goodbye.

01:46:07.133 --> 01:46:09.226
<i>911 emergency.</i>

01:46:13.673 --> 01:46:15.436
I need an ambulance.

01:46:15.642 --> 01:46:20.204
<i>I have you at 9212 West Third Street</i>
<i>in Los Angeles.</i>

01:46:23.416 --> 01:46:25.407
Yes, room number 2.

01:46:26.152 --> 01:46:28.279
<i>What's the emergency?</i>

01:46:30.723 --> 01:46:32.918
There's been a suicide.

01:46:33.126 --> 01:46:34.923
<i>Who's the victim?</i>

01:46:36.896 --> 01:46:38.261
I am.

01:46:40.199 --> 01:46:42.861
You are gonna need to stop
looking at that thing so much.

01:46:43.069 --> 01:46:45.731
Why? Is it gonna crack?

01:46:45.939 --> 01:46:48.533
Oh, no. I paid extra
for the non-cracking kind.

01:46:48.741 --> 01:46:50.436
I bet you did.

01:46:51.210 --> 01:46:54.236
- Why don't you just turn that off?
- I know. No more. No more work.

01:46:54.447 --> 01:46:56.074
I'm done. Almost done. Almost done.

01:46:56.282 --> 01:46:57.806
Tim!

01:49:53.159 --> 01:49:54.183
I have procedures.

01:49:54.393 --> 01:49:57.851
I understand, but she needs
that heart or she will die.

01:50:19.085 --> 01:50:21.781
- Ben?
- One, two, three.

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:36.061
Hey.

01:50:36.469 --> 01:50:38.528
How you doing?

01:52:45.831 --> 01:52:49.028
About a year after the accident,
I got sick.

01:52:50.503 --> 01:52:54.769
I got lung cancer,
and I needed a double-lobe transplant.

01:52:56.375 --> 01:52:59.139
Tim could only give me one,
of course.

01:52:59.946 --> 01:53:02.813
It must have planted a seed,
because he...

01:53:04.216 --> 01:53:06.446
About six months later...

01:53:08.387 --> 01:53:11.845
...he donated the right part of his
liver to this woman.

01:53:15.161 --> 01:53:18.255
Her name is Holly.

01:55:59.158 --> 01:56:02.150
I'm proud of you kids. Very proud.

01:56:02.361 --> 01:56:05.057
Good job. Good job.

01:56:05.264 --> 01:56:07.232
- Ezra.
- Yeah.

01:56:07.433 --> 01:56:08.832
Hi.

01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:13.502
Are you a parent?

01:56:13.706 --> 01:56:15.003
No.

01:56:16.842 --> 01:56:18.742
Have we met?

01:56:24.150 --> 01:56:25.742
You okay?

01:56:39.598 --> 01:56:41.361
You must be Emily.

01:56:47.506 --> 01:56:49.064
Yes.

01:56:52.278 --> 01:56:54.803
It's so nice to meet you.
