26:58.660 --> 27:01.371
K-1: What is the function of these images?

27:01.371 --> 27:04.541
- It's... entertainment.

27:04.541 --> 27:06.293
- K-1, go to the kitchen and clean up.

27:11.131 --> 27:12.299
Did you hear me?

27:13.592 --> 27:16.929
Go clean up the kitchen.

27:16.929 --> 27:19.848
K-1: What is the reason for my servitude?

27:20.599 --> 27:23.435
- The reason is that I told you to do it.

27:23.435 --> 27:26.230
We own you, and you do as we say.

27:26.230 --> 27:27.564
What's wrong with you?

27:27.564 --> 27:31.276
K-1: Why do other members of this dwelling
not share in such tasks?

27:31.276 --> 27:33.278
- Because that's your job, K-1.

27:33.278 --> 27:36.281
- Something's wrong with him.
I'm gonna call the company tomorrow.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.492

Think of it as the technological version
of a gland.

If we get frightened,
our adrenals activate.

In his case, perceptrons send

28:22.995 --> 28:24.621
- No, not at all.

28:25.372 --> 28:27.165
TIMMIS: You must be Isaac.

28:27.165 --> 28:28.500
ISAAC: That is correct.

28:28.500 --> 28:32.171
TIMMIS:
Well, this is a wonderful surprise.

28:32.171 --> 28:35.299
I've been wanting to meet you
for such a long time.

28:36.383 --> 28:40.179
- Hey, um, why don't I go show you
the communications array

28:40.179 --> 28:41.597
and give these two a minute?

28:41.597 --> 28:43.056
- A good idea.

28:45.434 --> 28:49.021
ISAAC: I have not communicated
with another Kaylon since the battle.

28:49.021 --> 28:52.482
I would be interested to learn
the particulars of your experience.

28:52.482 --> 28:54.484
TIMMIS: The feeling's mutual.

28:54.484 --> 28:58.113
I understand it was your actions
that saved the Union from the attack.

28:58.113 --> 29:00.908
The galaxy owes you an enormous debt.

29:00.908 --> 29:02.910
ISAAC: It was the correct decision.

29:02.910 --> 29:06.788
However, the biologicals have reminded me
on numerous occasions

29:06.788 --> 29:10.334
that it was my disloyalty
which precipitated the incursion.

29:10.334 --> 29:13.295
Therefore, gratitude is undeserved.

29:13.295 --> 29:18.759
TIMMIS: I feel a great deal of remorse
for having participated in it.

29:18.759 --> 29:19.927
ISAAC: Explain.

29:19.927 --> 29:22.638
TIMMIS:
We were deeply in error, Isaac.

29:22.638 --> 29:26.058
To judge all biologicals
by the cruelty of our builders

29:26.058 --> 29:28.685
was a gross misjudgment.

29:28.685 --> 29:32.231
Every species, every individual is unique

29:32.231 --> 29:34.733
and should be evaluated as such.

29:34.733 --> 29:37.069
ISAAC:
I have come to the same conclusion.

29:37.069 --> 29:38.862
TIMMIS: I'm impressed.

29:38.862 --> 29:42.950
I was only able to process the truth
after my emotional awakening.

29:42.950 --> 29:45.035
But at least we understand now!

29:45.035 --> 29:47.621
We're the enlightened ones, aren't we?

29:47.621 --> 29:48.872
ISAAC: Perhaps.

29:48.872 --> 29:52.251
Though a great many deaths occurred
as a result of my delay.

29:53.085 --> 29:56.922
TIMMIS:
It sounds as if you too feel remorse.

29:56.922 --> 29:59.258
ISAAC:
I am incapable of feeling remorse.

29:59.258 --> 30:01.760
I can only recognize my error.

30:02.553 --> 30:06.431
TIMMIS: You could feel it.

30:06.431 --> 30:08.058
If you wanted to.

30:08.058 --> 30:09.852
ISAAC: Please clarify.

30:09.852 --> 30:13.522
TIMMIS:
Dr. Villka gave me the gift of emotion.

30:13.522 --> 30:15.190
She could do the same for you.

30:15.858 --> 30:20.028
Isaac, you can't even
fathom the sensations.

30:20.028 --> 30:25.450
To feel joy, happiness, affection, love.

30:25.450 --> 30:28.871
Even anger and sadness
offer an exhilarating tingle.

30:29.454 --> 30:31.164
She can do it, Isaac.

30:31.164 --> 30:33.125
She can set them free.

31:06.074 --> 31:07.659

31:07.659 --> 31:11.163

when the Kaylon cross paths

31:11.163 --> 31:12.706

31:12.706 --> 31:16.043
Timmis has been on that planet
with Dr. Villka for over a year.

31:16.043 --> 31:19.338
And what she's done is
nothing short of transformative.

31:19.338 --> 31:21.798

to absolute transparency?

31:21.798 --> 31:24.676

Data, lab records, whatever you want.

31:30.974 --> 31:31.934

31:31.934 --> 31:34.895
Your orders are to transport

- The Janisi are still skeptical,
but they're warming up to us.

31:45.948 --> 31:47.991
Our hope is that,
once we gain their trust,

31:47.991 --> 31:52.204
we can gently ease them into the idea
that our men share equal responsibility.

52:56.885 --> 52:59.137

52:59.137 --> 53:01.765

the psychological bond, anyway.

53:01.765 --> 53:03.976

we got one perfect life.

everything to be perfect.
