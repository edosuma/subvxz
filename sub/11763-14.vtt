WEBVTT

00:01.132 --> 00:03.134
I'M JUST TRYING
TO GIVE YOU A SURPRISE!

00:03.134 --> 00:06.137
WHY ARE YOU STRUGGLING?
WELL, I CAN'T HELP IT!
I KEEP HAVING

00:06.137 --> 00:08.139
THIS RECURRING DREAM THAT
YOU GET BORED WITH ME,

00:08.139 --> 00:11.142
AND SO YOU BLINDFOLD ME
AND THROW ME IN A WOOD CHIPPER.

00:11.142 --> 00:13.284
WELL, THEN DON'T EVER
GET BORING.

00:13.284 --> 00:15.316
AHH.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.418
BUT, SWEETIE, VALENTINE'S DAY
ISN'T TILL TOMORROW.

00:17.418 --> 00:20.551
AW, BOY TOY CAN'T READ
A CALENDAR?
(Grayson) GIVING FLOWERS
ONVALENTINE'S DAY?

00:20.551 --> 00:22.553
(singsongy) LAME-O.

00:22.553 --> 00:24.555
(normal voice)
THE DAY BEFORE?

00:24.555 --> 00:27.027
ROCK STAR! WHOO!
WHICH REMINDS ME...

00:27.027 --> 00:29.130
HAPPY DAY BEFORE
VALENTINE'S DAY, KIRSTEN.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.762
YOU KNOW, JUST IN CASE
TRAVIS FORGOT.

00:31.762 --> 00:33.364
HE DID FORGET.

00:33.364 --> 00:36.767
FORGET WHAT? IT'S NOT A THING.
(lowered voice) DUDE, WHY?

00:36.767 --> 00:39.670
DON'T CALL ME "BOY TOY."
MM.

00:39.670 --> 00:43.414
AW. WHY ARE HER FLOWERS
BIGGER THAN MINE?

00:43.414 --> 00:45.116
THEY'RE THE SAME SIZE.

00:45.116 --> 00:47.678
WHY ARE THEY THE SAME SIZE?

00:47.678 --> 00:49.680
(laughs) I'M JUST KIDDING.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.823
BUT FIX IT.

00:52.823 --> 00:55.756
(chuckles)
THAT IS SO MUCH BETTER.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.759
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU PUT LOVE
OUT INTO THE WORLD,

00:58.759 --> 01:01.232
IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO YOU.
WATCH THIS.

01:01.232 --> 01:03.334
HEY, TRAVIS!
YOU'RE SUCH A GREAT SON.

01:03.334 --> 01:05.636
I LOVE YOU.

01:05.636 --> 01:08.269
(chuckles)

01:08.269 --> 01:11.172
LOOKIN' HOT TODAY, MRS. T.

01:13.544 --> 01:16.307
GO MAKE ME SOME MONEY,
HANDSOME.

01:19.150 --> 01:21.112
BEST BRO IN THE WORLD,
EVERYBODY,

01:21.112 --> 01:22.513
SITTIN' RIGHT THERE.

01:24.785 --> 01:28.559
DOUBLE FRAP-CAP
FOR THE LOVELY LADY.

01:28.559 --> 01:30.161
WELL...

01:31.592 --> 01:34.425
DAMN, TOM.

01:34.425 --> 01:37.698
YOUR GARDEN LOOKSGOOD.

01:42.433 --> 01:45.436
I KNOW YOU LOVE STICKY BUNS,
SO I MADE THESE FROM SCRATCH.

01:45.436 --> 01:48.309
WOW. THANKS, TOM.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.710
HEY, GANG.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.512
(all) HI!

01:51.512 --> 01:53.584
WHAT A PHONY.
UGH.

01:53.584 --> 01:55.586
(Andy) OHH.
(Grayson)
GOD, HE'S PAINFUL.

01:55.586 --> 01:58.589
CIRCLE OF LOVE. FEEL IT IN
YOUR HEARTS. STEP THE HELL OFF.
HEY!

01:58.589 --> 02:00.191
WELL, I'M...

02:00.191 --> 02:02.153
UGH. I'M SO ANNOYED.

02:02.153 --> 02:03.554
TOMORROW'S
ST. VALENTINE'S DAY.

02:03.554 --> 02:06.157
WHAT SAINT DECIDED
THAT WOMEN HAVE TO PUT OUT

02:06.157 --> 02:09.330
JUST BECAUSE SOME IDIOT
BOUGHT THEM AN $8 TEDDY BEAR?

02:09.330 --> 02:11.732
(all imitate gobbling)
EW.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.734
ALL VALENTINE'S DAY
MEANS TO ME

02:13.734 --> 02:16.537
IS THAT IT IS SEVEN WEEKS
AFTERCHRISTMAS.

02:16.537 --> 02:19.139
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU
LAST NIGHT.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.712
(voice amplified)
ATTENTION NEIGHBORHOOD IDIOTS!
(static crackling)

02:21.712 --> 02:24.315
CHRISTMAS WAS SEVEN WEEKS AGO!

02:24.315 --> 02:27.448
TAKE DOWN YOUR TACKY LIGHTS
OR DIE!

02:27.448 --> 02:29.450
THANK YOU. THAT IS ALL.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.382
I LOVE VALENTINE'S DAY.

02:31.382 --> 02:35.826
I DON'T CARE WHETHER
I GET FLOWERS OR A DEERSKIN.
AH, THE DEERSKIN WAS ME.

02:35.826 --> 02:37.458
NO!
YEAH.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.560
WELL,
MY WORST VALENTINE'S DAY--

02:39.560 --> 02:43.163
NO ONE SAID HER DEERSKIN WAS
THE WORST. TELL HER, JULES.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.836
IT'S OKAY, LAURIE. GO AHEAD.

02:45.836 --> 02:47.438
I'LL BULLET POINT IT.

02:47.438 --> 02:50.371
MIAMI. HUGE PARTY. SEX.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.903
TURNS OUT, NOT DAN MARINO.

02:52.903 --> 02:56.247
HOW ABOUT YOU, BOY TOY? WHAT'S
YOUR WORST VALENTINE'S DAY?

02:56.247 --> 02:58.409
I GUESS THAT WOULD BE
TWO YEARS AGO,

02:58.409 --> 03:00.351
WHEN MY DAD DIED.

03:00.351 --> 03:02.753
WELL, I GUESS
THAT TRUMPS THE STORY

03:02.753 --> 03:05.356
ABOUT THE RESTAURANT
THAT OVERCOOKED MY SWORDFISH.

03:05.356 --> 03:07.758
(chuckles) WELL, YOU KNOW,
SWORDFISH CAN BE REALLY DRY.

03:07.758 --> 03:10.821
IT IS SO DRY,
AND I HAD RUN OUT OF WATER--
JULES.

03:10.821 --> 03:14.825
YEAH. OH, SORRY.
SO, GRAYSON,
WHAT WAS YOUR DAD LIKE?

03:14.825 --> 03:17.868
ANYONE WHO DOESN'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS, RAISE YOUR HAND.

03:17.868 --> 03:20.971
REALLY? I'M THE ONLY ONE?

03:20.971 --> 03:23.404
NO, NO. EVEN THOUGH
I ASKED, ME, TOO.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.806
WOW, GRAYSON'S EVEN MORE
CLOSED OFF EMOTIONALLY

03:25.806 --> 03:28.409
THAN THE COLD ONE HERE.
WELL, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.781
I DON'T EVEN THINK
I HAVE TEAR DUCTS.

03:30.781 --> 03:33.484
SO WHAT'S IT LIKE WHEN
GRAYSON GETS ALL VULNERABLE?

03:33.484 --> 03:37.217
WHAT NOW?
I FIGURED THAT WITH YOU,
HE FEELS COMFORTABLE,

03:37.217 --> 03:40.220
HE CAN OPEN UP.
(chuckles) TOTALLY.
YOU KNOW, THIS MORNING

03:40.220 --> 03:42.222
WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT HIS CHILDHOOD.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.495
(both) OH.
YEAH, HE WAS
A REALLY SICK KID.

03:44.495 --> 03:46.927
HE USED TO HAVE TO WEAR
THOSE METAL BRACES ON HIS LEGS,

03:46.927 --> 03:49.930
LIKE, UM, FORREST GUMP,
AND, WELL, HIS SISTER DID, TOO.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.533
HIS MOTHER SAID THEY USED
TO GET SO TANGLED UP THAT...

03:52.533 --> 03:53.934
(chuckles)
THAT TO GET 'EM APART,

03:53.934 --> 03:55.936
SHE'D HAVE TO USE...
(deep voice) A BIG HOOK...

03:55.936 --> 03:57.938
(normal voice) AND JUST...
(clicks tongue)
A HOOK?

03:57.938 --> 03:59.670
YEAH.
OH.

03:59.670 --> 04:02.643
HMM. HE DOESN'T OPEN UP
TO YOU, DOES HE?
NO.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.975
IT MAKES YOU CRAZY, DOESN'T IT?
YES.

04:04.975 --> 04:07.918
ARE YOU MAD BECAUSE
SHE SEEMS HAPPY ABOUT IT?
YES AGAIN.

04:07.918 --> 04:10.921
WELL...
HE'S PROBABLY JUST SCARED.
I NEED TO LET HIM KNOW

04:10.921 --> 04:13.924
THAT IF HE WANTS TO OPEN UP
TO ME, IT'S OKAY, YOU KNOW?

04:13.924 --> 04:16.026
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD PLAN.
YEAH.
YEAH. THAT'LL WORK.

04:16.026 --> 04:18.289
MMM.

04:18.289 --> 04:20.491
UNACCEPTABLE.
I'LL BUY YOU NEW ONES.

04:20.491 --> 04:23.263
THEY WERE PROBABLY,
LIKE, 100 BUCKS.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.266
YOU MAY KEEP ONE.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.569
THAT IS MY GIFT TO YOU.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.971
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'D REALLY LIKE, TRAV?

04:30.971 --> 04:33.704
(whispers) WHAT?
A SEXY PICTURE.

04:33.704 --> 04:35.946
(normal voice) WHAT, LIKE,
RYAN REYNOLDS RIDING A HORSE

04:35.946 --> 04:38.879
OR SOMETHING?
NO, OF YOU.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.312
(chuckles)
LIKE...SEXYOR...

04:41.312 --> 04:44.685
NO, LIKE,SEXYSEXY.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.919
DONE!

04:48.919 --> 04:51.522
PREPARE FOR THE HEAT WAVE.
(chuckles)

04:55.696 --> 04:57.297
I'M SCREWED.

04:58.929 --> 05:01.332
LET ME GUESS.

05:01.332 --> 05:04.335
YOU GUYS FINALLY KISSED,
AND ONLY ONE OF YOU LOVED IT.

05:04.335 --> 05:07.438
I'M HELPING ANDY BRAINSTORM
VALENTINE'S DAY PLANS FOR YA.

05:07.438 --> 05:10.511
SOMETIMES I SEE MY IDEAS
IN BOBBY'S EYES.

05:10.511 --> 05:14.385
WERE YOU NOT LISTENING BEFORE?
I HATE VALENTINE'S DAY.

05:14.385 --> 05:17.017
BUT I'M A SHOWMAN.
I NEED TO WOW YOU.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.390
NO, THANKS.

05:19.390 --> 05:20.851
COME ON!

05:20.851 --> 05:22.853
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

05:22.853 --> 05:25.656
(sighs) THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

05:28.459 --> 05:30.531
(ice cubes rattle)

05:30.531 --> 05:33.534
OH, THERE'S MY BOYFRIEND.
MYBOY-FRIZZLE.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.637
(chuckles) PEOPLE DON'T SAY
"IZZLE" ANYMORE. IT'S LAME.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.740
WELL, IDISAGRIZZLE.
(chuckles) I JUST CAME BY

05:39.740 --> 05:42.913
'CAUSE I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
BE THINKING ABOUT YOUR DAD.

05:42.913 --> 05:46.346
I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT IF YOU EVER WANT TO TALK

05:46.346 --> 05:49.480
ABOUT HIM WITH JUST ME,
MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.453
LIKE RIGHT NOW, FOR EXAMPLE.
NO, NO. HERE IT GOES.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.785
IT'S CLOSING. (chuckles)
NO. PSYCH! IT'S STILL OPEN.

05:54.785 --> 05:57.127
IT'S NOT EVEN A DOOR.

05:57.127 --> 05:59.590
IT'S--IT'S BEADS THAT
YOU JUST WALK RIGHT THROUGH.

05:59.590 --> 06:00.991
I'M FINE, JULES.

06:00.991 --> 06:03.934
FANTIZZLE.

06:03.934 --> 06:06.397
DO YOU WORK AT ALL?

06:07.868 --> 06:10.471
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO HELP YOU

06:10.471 --> 06:12.473
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S PRESENT,
TRAVIS.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.874
UGH.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.547
WHY ARE YOU EATING...
(French accent) A CROISSANT?

06:16.547 --> 06:18.949
(normal voice)
WHAT ARE YOU, FRENCH?

06:18.949 --> 06:20.951
WHY ARE YOU DRINKING TEA?

06:20.951 --> 06:22.983
WHAT ARE YOU, FRENCH?

06:22.983 --> 06:27.918
JUST GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES
OF PEACE BEFORE YOU START IN!

06:27.918 --> 06:30.421
(whirs, pieces rattle)

06:30.421 --> 06:32.963
YEAH, I MURDERED
YOUR SANTA CLAUS,

06:32.963 --> 06:35.966
AND IF YOU DON'T TAKE DOWN
YOUR STUPID DECORATIONS,

06:35.966 --> 06:39.029
THE REINDEER'S NEXT.

06:39.029 --> 06:42.473
YOUR FRIENDS ARE JERKS!

06:42.473 --> 06:44.134
(whirs and clanks)

06:44.134 --> 06:45.706
YOU MISSED ONE, TOM!

06:45.706 --> 06:47.538
(whirs)

06:47.538 --> 06:50.611
OH, DAMN IT!
STUPID CIRCLE OF ANGER.

06:50.611 --> 06:55.546
в™Єв™Єв™Є

07:02.853 --> 07:05.796
IT IS SO STUBBORN TO SAY YOU'RE
NOT TO--OH. UNBELIEVABLE.
QUIET. ENOUGH ALREADY.
SHUSH IT.

07:05.796 --> 07:08.959
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY.
CAPTAIN EMO'S BEEN FOLLOWING ME
AROUND YAPPING ABOUT ROMANCE

07:08.959 --> 07:11.201
AND VOMITING "I LOVE YOUS"
ALL OVER ME.

07:11.201 --> 07:13.564
THAT'S BECAUSE
CAPTAIN EMO LOVES YOU.

07:13.564 --> 07:15.836
(gags)
JUST LET ME TAKE YOU OUT
TONIGHT.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.739
NOPE.
JULES, MAKE HER GO.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.512
(chuckles) YEAH, 'CAUSE IT'S SO
EASY TO MAKE THIS ONE DO STUFF.

07:21.512 --> 07:24.214
ELLIE, LOOK OVER HERE!
SEE?

07:24.214 --> 07:26.216
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER,

07:26.216 --> 07:28.679
GRAYSON IS BUGGING ME
TODAY, TOO.
(door opens and closes)

07:28.679 --> 07:30.080
MM.
HEY.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.682
HEY.
THERE'S MY VALENTINE.

07:31.682 --> 07:35.526
OHH.
ANYTHING YOU NEED TODAY,
I AM ON IT. MWAH.

07:35.526 --> 07:36.957
(chuckles)

07:36.957 --> 07:38.559
WEAK.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.990
JULES IS MAD

07:39.990 --> 07:42.833
'CAUSE GRAYSON NEVER POURS
HIS HEART OUT TO HER.
IT IS UNHEALTHY

07:42.833 --> 07:45.065
TO LIVE YOUR LIFE BOTTLING UP
YOUR FEELINGS INSIDE.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.467
(laughs) SHE WOULDN'T KNOW.
OH. NO.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.740
ANYWAY,
HE NEEDS TO LEARN...
HEY.

07:49.740 --> 07:53.173
JUST HAD TO GRAB MY GLASSES.
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
(gasps) MY CELL PHONE.
I THINK IT'S IN THE CAR.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.205
HEY, HEY, HEY.
DO YOU MIND?

07:55.205 --> 07:58.048
I SAID ANYTHING FOR YOU
TODAY.
(chuckles) OKAY.

07:58.048 --> 07:59.650
I LOVE YOU.

07:59.650 --> 08:01.982
(robotic voice)
THIS IS WHAT HUMANS SAY

08:01.982 --> 08:04.955
AND DO ON VALENTINE'S DAY.
(imitates beeps)
(door opens and closes)

08:04.955 --> 08:07.958
I KNOW YOU WANT HIM TO OPEN UP
MORE, BUT THOSE TINY EYES--

08:07.958 --> 08:11.592
I MEAN, CAN TEARS REALLY
EVEN FIT OUT OF THEM?

08:11.592 --> 08:13.594
(normal voice) OH, MY GOD.
TO SEE GRAYSON CRY--

08:13.594 --> 08:15.626
I MEAN, THAT IS LIKE
MY... MY DOUBLE RAINBOW.

08:15.626 --> 08:17.628
JULES,
IF YOU'RE PATIENT WITH HIM,

08:17.628 --> 08:20.901
EVENTUALLY HE'S GONNA FEEL
SAFE ENOUGH TO LET YOU IN.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.502
YEAH, I'M NOT WAITING.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.905
THIS IS THE ANNIVERSARY
OF HIS DAD'S DEATH.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.738
I'M GONNA CRACK
THAT SON OF A BITCHTODAY.

08:27.738 --> 08:30.010
(chuckles) SWEET.
YEAH, THAT IS SWEET.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.012
I KNOW
THE PERFECT PHOTOGRAPHER,

08:32.012 --> 08:33.984
AND I'M SORRY
I WAS BEING JERKY EARLIER.

08:33.984 --> 08:35.986
I'M ON
THIS NEW BIRTH CONTROL PILL,

08:35.986 --> 08:37.988
AND IT SLOWS DOWN
YOUR CYCLE SO MUCH THAT

08:37.988 --> 08:40.991
MY TIME OF THE MONTH ONLY COMES,
LIKE, ONCE EVERY 12 MONTHS.

08:40.991 --> 08:43.994
SERIOUSLY, I FEEL LIKE
I'M ABOUT TO GET MYYEARIOD.

08:43.994 --> 08:45.996
(inhales deeply)
CATCHING MY BREATH...

08:45.996 --> 08:47.598
AND WE KEEP WALKING.

08:47.598 --> 08:49.600
LOOK,
I'M JUST NOT LOVING THE IDEA

08:49.600 --> 08:52.603
OF SOME RANDOM ASS DUDE TAKING
SLUTTY PICTURES OF ME.

08:52.603 --> 08:54.605
BUDDY,
BOUDOIR PHOTOS ARE CLASSY.

08:54.605 --> 08:57.007
PLUS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
COMPLETELY NAKED.

08:57.007 --> 08:59.610
I SENT A PHOTO
TO THIS GUY IN IRAQ,

08:59.610 --> 09:01.642
AND MY JUNK WAS
COMPLETELY COVERED

09:01.642 --> 09:03.644
BY A REAL STUFFED EAGLE.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.577
SO PATRIOTIC.
ALL RIGHT. HERE WE ARE.

09:06.577 --> 09:09.149
WELL, HELLO THERE.
HEY, WANT A SNEAK PEEK

09:09.149 --> 09:12.322
AT MY VALENTINE'S DAY GIFT
FOR MY HOUSEBOY BENICIO?

09:12.322 --> 09:15.656
(gasps) WHOA! WHOA!
OHH!

09:15.656 --> 09:18.689
(chuckles) I KNOW.
I KEEP IT LONG IN THE WINTER.

09:18.689 --> 09:22.192
SHOW'S OVER, KITTENS.
(chuckles) TA-TA.

09:22.192 --> 09:24.194
PROMISE ME
THIS WON'T GET CREEPIER.

09:24.194 --> 09:27.567
(sighs) HONEY, IPROMISE.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.970
SHOULD WE START
WITH A GLASS OF SHERRY

09:29.970 --> 09:31.702
BEFORE YOU GET UNDRESSED?

09:31.702 --> 09:34.104
OKAY. I WAS WRONG.

09:34.104 --> 09:37.177
THERE'S SO MANY GREAT PICTURES
OF YOUR DAD IN HERE. WOW.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.779
WHAT WAS HE LIKE?

09:38.779 --> 09:41.081
HE WAS PRETTY COOL.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.353
YOU TWO LOOK SO MUCH ALIKE.

09:43.353 --> 09:46.156
YOU MUST SEE HIMEVERYDAY

09:46.156 --> 09:48.158
WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

09:48.158 --> 09:50.160
NOT REALLY.
WANT TO WATCH TV?

09:50.160 --> 09:53.894
YEAH, OR WE CAN WATCH YOUR
PARENTS' ANNIVERSARY VIDEO.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.727
OKAY. OHH.

09:56.727 --> 09:59.670
LOOK AT YOUR DAD DANCING
WITH YOUR MOM.

09:59.670 --> 10:03.003
OH, YOU JUST SEE THE LOVE
THEY HAVE FOR EACH OTHER.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.235
HEY!

10:05.235 --> 10:09.179
IT'S JUST OOZING OUT OF
THE SCREEN LIKE... WARM HONEY.

10:09.179 --> 10:10.781
(sighs)

10:10.781 --> 10:12.282
AND NOW HE'S GONE.

10:12.282 --> 10:15.015
(whispers) GONE FOREVER.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.948
GONE-ZO-ROONIE.

10:17.948 --> 10:21.291
(normal voice)
HOW CAN THIS NOT CRUSH YOU?

10:21.291 --> 10:23.393
MY MOM BEA DIED YEARS AGO,

10:23.393 --> 10:26.396
AND IF SOMEONE EVEN GETS STUNG
BY A BEE, I START CRYING.

10:26.396 --> 10:29.399
SO I'M TRYING TO MAKE THIS
THE PERFECT VALENTINE'S DAY

10:29.399 --> 10:33.063
FOR YOU, AND ALL YOU WANT
IS FOR ME TO BREAK DOWN

10:33.063 --> 10:36.066
ABOUT MY DAD DYING?
DON'T TWIST THIS AROUND LIKE
I SOUND LIKE THE WEIRD ONE.

10:36.066 --> 10:39.039
(chuckles) I MEAN...

10:39.039 --> 10:42.873
OHH.
I CAN'T TAKE A SEXY PICTURE.

10:42.873 --> 10:45.145
SHIRTLESS, I LOOK LIKE
ONE OF THOSE HAIRLESS CATS.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.048
(laughs)
YOUR MOTHER WANTS ME
TO OPEN UP EMOTIONALLY.

10:48.048 --> 10:51.682
(chuckles) I'D RATHER TOUCH
MY TONGUE TO A CAR BATTERY.
(mouths word)

10:51.682 --> 10:53.824
MY FRIEND NEZZIE DID THAT
ON A DARE.

10:53.824 --> 10:55.986
NOW SHE JUST SITS AROUND
WATCHING GAME SHOWS

10:55.986 --> 10:58.989
WITH A LADY THAT HELPS HER
GO TO THE BATHROOM.
ELLIE WON'T LET ME DO ANYTHING!
I'M A SHOWMAN!

10:58.989 --> 11:02.062
(plays chord)
WHAT'S A SHOWMAN
WITHOUT A SHOW?!

11:02.062 --> 11:04.294
(chord stops playing)
JUST A MAN.

11:04.294 --> 11:06.737
AT LEAST YOU GUYS HAVE
PEOPLE THAT LOVE YOU!

11:06.737 --> 11:08.869
GOD! YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY!

11:08.869 --> 11:11.441

SHE'S RIGHT, THOUGH.

11:15.445 --> 11:17.708
YOU GUYS ARE LUCKY.
I'M ALONE TONIGHT.

11:17.708 --> 11:20.711
NO, YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE ME TO A FANCY RESTAURANT

11:20.711 --> 11:23.313
AND THEN FAKE-DUMP ME SO THAT
I CAN GET A FREE MEAL.

11:23.313 --> 11:25.886

EXTREMELY HELPFUL.

11:40.070 --> 11:42.803
(door closes)
HEY.
WHY AREN'T YOU DRESSED UP?

11:42.803 --> 11:45.806
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING
TO A NICE RESTAURANT.
INSTEAD OF GOING OUT,

11:45.806 --> 11:49.309
I THOUGHT WE'D STAY IN,
AND I COULD TALK ABOUT MY DAD,

11:49.309 --> 11:52.312
LET IT ALL OUT...
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.
в™Є ALWAYS GIVE THE WOMEN в™Є

11:52.312 --> 11:54.885
в™Є WHAT THEY WANT в™Є
LET'S DO THIS!

11:54.885 --> 11:56.887
(Andy) OKAY.
I POURED THE CHAMPAGNE.

11:56.887 --> 11:59.019
I BOUGHT YOU
SOMETHING NICE TO WEAR,

11:59.019 --> 12:01.421
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GO
DO THE TOWN.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.493
ANDY! I TOLD YOU THAT I--

12:03.493 --> 12:06.496
I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU.
I LOVE THIS COAT.

12:06.496 --> 12:09.329
SO YOU BOUGHT ANOTHER MAN
CLOTHES?

12:09.329 --> 12:11.802
CHECK THE POCKET.

12:11.802 --> 12:13.363

12:13.363 --> 12:15.966

12:18.809 --> 12:20.240
(chuckles) I GET IT!

12:20.240 --> 12:22.342
(laughs)
(laughs) YEAH!

12:22.342 --> 12:24.244
GOOD LORD.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.876
(camera shutter clicks)
TRAVIS!

12:25.876 --> 12:28.478
DON'T BE NERVOUS.
IT'S JUST A PICTURE.

12:28.478 --> 12:30.951
I JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO STAND OR--

12:30.951 --> 12:34.825
OKAY, OKAY. LET ME SHOW YOU SOME
OF MY FAVORITE SEXY POSES, OKAY?

12:34.825 --> 12:37.757
THIS IS WARMING MY BUTT
BY THE CAMPFIRE.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.860
THIS ONE...
(husky voice) YEAH,

12:39.860 --> 12:42.963
I SIT BACKWARDS ON A CHAIR,
'CAUSE I'M A RULE-BREAKER.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.165
SEEMS NATURAL.

12:45.165 --> 12:48.839
(normal voice) IF YOU DO HAVE
THE COURAGE TO GO TOTALLY NUDE,

12:48.839 --> 12:50.240
THIS IS MY SHOWSTOPPER.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.973
HERE I AM!DEALWITH IT!

12:52.973 --> 12:55.305
HOW ABOUT I LOSE A BUTTON?

12:55.305 --> 12:58.008
HERE'S YOUR TISSUES
AND YOUR WINE.

12:58.008 --> 13:01.081
NOW IF THERE'S AN ART TO POURING
YOUR GUTS OUT, I'D BE PICASSO,

13:01.081 --> 13:04.815
SO IF YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS, JUST ASK.
CAN THE TV BE ON
WHILE WE DO THIS?

13:04.815 --> 13:06.316
NO.

13:06.316 --> 13:09.990
NOW YOU'RE GONNA WRAP YOURSELF
UP IN THIS CUDDLY BLANKET,

13:09.990 --> 13:12.993
BECAUSE WE WANT YOU TO LOOK
ALL SMALL AND VULNERABLE.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.996
NOW DON'T FEEL WEIRD IF I START
TO CRY ALONG WITH YOU,

13:15.996 --> 13:19.129
BECAUSE IT'S JUST GONNA
HAPPEN.
SUPER.

13:19.129 --> 13:21.872
LET'S GET THIS PARTY
STARTED.

13:21.872 --> 13:25.275
WELL, MY DAD'S NAME WAS GIL.
HE SPELLED IT WITH ONE "L."

13:25.275 --> 13:28.408
HIS DAD WAS ALSO NAMED GILL,
BUT HE SPELLED IT WITH TWO L's.

13:28.408 --> 13:31.511
LET'S FAST-FORWARD A BIT,
SHALL WE?

13:31.511 --> 13:34.514
UM, I HAPPENED TO JOT DOWN
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS

13:34.514 --> 13:36.887
TO GET US ON OUR WAY
TO BREAKDOWN CITY.

13:36.887 --> 13:39.289
UM, WERE YOU WITH YOUR DAD
WHEN HE PASSED?

13:39.289 --> 13:42.292
SINCE HE'S IN HEAVEN, DO YOU
THINK THAT HE'S MET MY MOM YET?

13:42.292 --> 13:46.056
OH, MY GOD. I'M HAVING
SO MUCH FUN ALREADY. (chuckles)

13:46.056 --> 13:48.058
WHEN I WAS A KID,

13:48.058 --> 13:50.400
MY DAD ALWAYS USED
TO SAY...

13:50.400 --> 13:52.002
I CAN'T DO THIS.

13:52.002 --> 13:54.004
WHAT?
YOUR DAD COULDN'T DO WHAT?

13:54.004 --> 13:57.137
(gasps)
HUG YOU? SAY "I LOVE YOU"?

13:57.137 --> 14:00.270
THROW THINGS AWAY?
OH, WAS HE A HOARDER?

14:00.270 --> 14:01.912
NO, JULES.

14:01.912 --> 14:05.075
в™Є ALWAYS GIVE THE WOMEN
WHAT THEY WANT в™Є
I CAN'T DOTHIS.

14:05.075 --> 14:07.847
в™Є UNLESS YOU CAN'T в™Є

14:07.847 --> 14:11.251
AH. AND WE'RE OUT!
в™Є IF THEY WANT IT, THEN DO IT,
IF THEY DON'T, STILL DO IT в™Є

14:11.251 --> 14:13.253
в™Є 'CAUSE WOMEN DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY WANT в™Є

14:13.253 --> 14:16.426
в™Є 'CAUSE IT'S RELIABLE
THEY'RE UNSATISFIABLE в™Є

14:16.426 --> 14:20.360
в™Є YOU CAN NEVER GIVE A WOMEN
WHAT THEY WANT в™Є
OH, MY GOD. I'M OUT.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.893
I'M SORRY, JULES. I'M OUT.

14:22.893 --> 14:26.396
в™Є YOU CAN NEVER GIVE A WOMAN в™Є
(sighs) QUITTER!

14:26.396 --> 14:29.900
в™Є WHAT THEY WANT в™Є
(groans)

14:35.375 --> 14:37.047
HEY!

14:37.047 --> 14:38.448
TOM.

14:38.448 --> 14:40.981
DOES JULES KNOW
YOU'RE HERE?

14:40.981 --> 14:44.654
I ASSUME SO, SINCE I JUST...
MURDERED HER.

14:44.654 --> 14:47.017
I MADE A JOKE.

14:47.017 --> 14:50.160
LAUGH!
TOM'S ALWAYS WANTING TO SPEND
TIME WITH THE CREW,

14:50.160 --> 14:53.123
SO I INVITED HIM IN
FOR A GLASS OF WINE.

14:53.123 --> 14:56.126
IT IS JUST SO NICE
TO SPEND TIME WITH SOMEONE

14:56.126 --> 14:58.668
WHO'S NOT AFRAID TO--TO SHARE
THEIR DREAMS AND THEIR FEARS.

14:58.668 --> 15:02.332
SPEAKING OF DREAMS,YOUWERE
IN MY DREAM LAST NIGHT.

15:02.332 --> 15:05.335
I NEEDED A MAKEOVER, AND YOU
WERE LIKE EDWARD SCISSORHANDS,

15:05.335 --> 15:07.938
EXCEPT THAT YOUR HANDS
WERE ALL LIPSTICK TUBES

15:07.938 --> 15:10.010
AND MASCARA WANDS.

15:10.010 --> 15:13.143
I WOULD LOVE THAT.
YOU WERE IN MY DREAM,
TOO, JULES.

15:13.143 --> 15:15.585
OH, WHAT WAS I DOING?
WE WERE MAKING LOVE.

15:15.585 --> 15:18.248
ATTABOY, TOM.
HAVE A GOOD ONE, JULES.

15:18.248 --> 15:20.951
ACTUALLY I MIGHT NOT HAVE
BEEN COMPLETELY ASLEEP,

15:20.951 --> 15:22.953
BUT I FELL ASLEEP
SHORTLY AFTERWARDS.

15:22.953 --> 15:25.956
TIME TO GO, TOM.
(sighs) I GET TOO EXCITED
WHEN I'M HERE.

15:25.956 --> 15:27.697
OH, GOD. (gags)

15:27.697 --> 15:31.431
I KNOW IT'S CORNY TO ASK YOU
THIS ON VALENTINE'S DAY,

15:31.431 --> 15:34.704
BUT... KAREN...

15:34.704 --> 15:36.706
(clink)

15:36.706 --> 15:39.239
(both clenching teeth,
singsongy) PENNY CAN!

15:39.239 --> 15:40.640
(clink)
YEAH!

15:40.640 --> 15:42.642
I HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU
FOR 20 MINUTES.

15:42.642 --> 15:46.416
WHY ISN'T YOUR PHONE ON?
YOU TOLD ME IT WAS RUDE TO LEAVE
MY PHONE ON DURING A DATE.

15:46.416 --> 15:49.419
WHEN I SAID I DIDN'T WANT
TO DO ANYTHING TONIGHT,

15:49.419 --> 15:52.022
IT DIDN'T MEAN
I WANTED TO BE ALONE

15:52.022 --> 15:54.284
WHILE YOU ACTED
LIKE YOU JUST GOT A ROSE

15:54.284 --> 15:56.686
ON THE GAY HILLBILLY VERSION
OF "THE BACHELOR"!

15:56.686 --> 15:59.229
IT'S WORKING.

15:59.229 --> 16:03.033
GREAT. HEY, GUYS!
CAN I GET MY PENNY BACK?

16:03.033 --> 16:05.635
IT'S 1969.
(laughs)

16:05.635 --> 16:07.697
(laughs) HE GETS IT.
(laughs)

16:07.697 --> 16:10.370
(clicking)
YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD
MY DATE GOT CUT SHORT.

16:10.370 --> 16:13.673
YEAH, THIS IS
A GREAT FATHER-SON MOMENT,

16:13.673 --> 16:16.506
BUT WHY DOES LAURIE
HAVE TO BE HERE?
WHAT?

16:16.506 --> 16:19.509
SHE SHOULDN'T MISS OUT ON THIS
JUST 'CAUSE YOU GOT EMBARRASSED.

16:19.509 --> 16:22.512
BEFORE, WHEN HE WAS POSING,
HE JUST WASN'T OWNING IT, OKAY?

16:22.512 --> 16:26.056
HE NEEDS TO PULL THE CAMERA'S
PANTS DOWN WITH HIS EYES.
THIS COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE.

16:26.056 --> 16:28.588
CUE MY ENTRANCE. (chuckles)
I WAS LISTENING OUTSIDE.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.690
(high-pitched voice)
KILL ME. (laughs)

16:30.690 --> 16:33.423
OKAY. TAKE ONE FOR ME.
(slaps leg)

16:33.423 --> 16:35.465
HAS ANYONE SEEN GRAYSON?

16:35.465 --> 16:38.298
UH, HE DECIDED
TO GO IN TO WORK.
THAT JERK!

16:38.298 --> 16:41.101
(clicking continues)
HONEY, TRY TO MAKE YOUR MOUTH
A LITTLE BIT POUTY-ER.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.133
WH--YOU CAN SEE
THROUGH THE BLINDFOLD?

16:43.133 --> 16:46.306
NO.
I'M JUST A LITTLE PSYCHIC.

16:46.306 --> 16:49.309
(pops)
YOU CAME TO WORK
ON VALENTINE'S DAY?

16:49.309 --> 16:51.711
LOOKS THAT WAY.

16:51.711 --> 16:55.115
HEY, I'M SORRY FOR PUSHING
YOUR BUTTONS TODAY.

16:55.115 --> 16:58.518
LOOK, WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
TRYING TO CHANGE ME?

16:58.518 --> 17:01.491
I LOVE YOU THE WAY YOU ARE.
I DON'T TRY AND CHANGE YOU.
WELL, THAT'S
BECAUSE I'M NOT ANNOYING.

17:01.491 --> 17:03.723
YOU REALLY WANT TO OPEN
THAT DOOR?

17:03.723 --> 17:06.196
NOPE.
YOU SEE ALL THESE COUPLES
HERE?

17:06.196 --> 17:08.328
WE COULD'VE HAD A NICE,
ROMANTIC, NORMAL EVENING,

17:08.328 --> 17:10.260
JUST LIKE THEM.

17:10.260 --> 17:12.262
AFTER YOU CLEAN THE POOL,

17:12.262 --> 17:15.505
I'M GONNA SHAVE EVERY INCH
OF YOU.
(clink)

17:15.505 --> 17:19.339
(sighs) THAT IS NOT
A CLASSY TOAST.
I KNOW YOU WANT ME TO BE
SOME EMOTIONAL GIRLIE MAN

17:19.339 --> 17:21.611
WHO LOVES TALKING
ABOUT HIS FEELINGS,

17:21.611 --> 17:24.614
BUT THAT IS NEVER GOING
TO HAPPEN.
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

17:24.614 --> 17:27.217
WELL, THEN WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME?

17:27.217 --> 17:30.220
I JUST WANT YOU BE
ALITTLEDIFFERENT WITH ME

17:30.220 --> 17:33.123
THAN YOU ARE
WITH EVERYONE ELSE.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.728
WELL, YOU RUINED
A PERFECTLY MAGICAL EVENING.

17:38.728 --> 17:40.730
I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD
OF YOURSELF.

17:40.730 --> 17:44.234
I AM.
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHY YOU'RE MAD AT ME?

17:44.234 --> 17:47.237
NOPE.
I BEGGED YOU TO LET ME
WOW YOU FOR VALENTINE'S DAY,

17:47.237 --> 17:50.270
AND YOU SAID NO.
IT WAS
ONE OF MY CRAZY NOs,

17:50.270 --> 17:53.273
LIKE WHEN YOU ASK ME
IF I WANT YOU TO GET ME DINNER,

17:53.273 --> 17:55.675
AND I SAY
I'M NEVER EATING AGAIN.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.408
ANDY, YOU'RE JUST SUPPOSED
TO KNOW WHAT I WANT,

17:58.408 --> 18:01.080
EVEN WHEN I'M SAYING
CRAZY, STUPID THINGS

18:01.080 --> 18:04.454
THAT I DON'T MEAN, ESPECIALLY
WHEN I THINK I MEAN THEM.

18:04.454 --> 18:07.457
I MEAN, LIKE NOW. I-I DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

18:07.457 --> 18:09.719
(voice breaks)
I REALLY FEEL CRAZY.

18:09.719 --> 18:11.721
COME HERE.
(normal voice) WHERE?

18:11.721 --> 18:13.723
WE'RE GONNA GO OUTSIDE.

18:13.723 --> 18:17.227
FOR THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,
CHAM-PAHG-NEE...

18:17.227 --> 18:19.769
YOUR BEST FRIEND,
WHO SHOULDN'T LOOK SAD...

18:19.769 --> 18:22.272
SORRY.

18:22.272 --> 18:24.874
AND FINALLY...
BOBBY, SHOWTIME!

18:24.874 --> 18:26.576
(switch clicks)

18:26.576 --> 18:28.178
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!

18:28.178 --> 18:31.341
YOU TOOK DOWN EVERYONE'S
CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS FOR ME?

18:31.341 --> 18:33.843
AND THE GOLDSTEINS'
GIANT INFLATABLE DREIDEL,

18:33.843 --> 18:36.716
WHATEVER THE HELL THAT IS.

18:36.716 --> 18:40.250
I FIGURED WE'D DRINK A LITTLE
AND THEN BURN EVERYTHING.
(clink)

18:40.250 --> 18:42.752
IT'S PERFECT.

18:42.752 --> 18:45.625
JUST LET ME OPEN IT NOW.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.628
OKAY.(chuckles)
OHH. I HOPE IT LOOKS LIKE
THAT ONE OF YOU IN THE BLAZER.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.631
THAT IS SO SEXY.
SO WHEN YOU SAID,
"SEXY PICTURE,"

18:51.631 --> 18:54.464
YOU MEANTNORMALSEXY,
NOT, LIKE, A WEIRD ONE

18:54.464 --> 18:57.267
WHERE I'M HALF-NAKED AND HAVE
A ROSE IN MY MOUTH OR ANYTHING,

18:57.267 --> 18:59.269
BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST BE
