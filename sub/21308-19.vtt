00:47.831 --> 00:50.541
MAN: Deep in the sand,
a wicked ember glows,

00:50.541 --> 00:53.621
though all around,
a chilling wind doth blow.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.671
With heat and spark
and smoke uncurled,

00:56.671 --> 01:01.041
bring forth the fires
of the underworld!

01:03.501 --> 01:06.911
Get back here!
I'm gonna claw you in the head!

01:06.911 --> 01:10.911
I love how ♪ spooky ♪
underworld beaches are.

01:10.911 --> 01:13.911
Isn't that kind of...
the underworld's thing?

01:13.911 --> 01:15.831
Yeah, it's pretty metal.

01:15.831 --> 01:18.871
Hey, Star, finished
your marshmallow.

01:18.871 --> 01:22.081
Aw, I finished
yours, too! Twins.

01:23.871 --> 01:28.831
Wait a second--
is that one of my hoodies?

01:28.831 --> 01:30.501
Yeah, I gave him
a spare one for the beach.

01:30.501 --> 01:32.081
I gave it
a little custom job.

01:32.081 --> 01:35.291
-No! Oh, man!

01:35.291 --> 01:37.871
Kelly, can I have
one of yours?

01:37.871 --> 01:40.961
Um, I actually licked
all of these.

01:40.961 --> 01:42.871
Yeah, okay, never mind.

01:42.871 --> 01:45.331
Aw, it's okay, Marco,
you can have our last one.

01:45.331 --> 01:46.411
Here you go, dude.

01:46.411 --> 01:48.331
Oh, man, the Soulrise

01:48.331 --> 01:50.711
is gonna be
♪ so great ♪ this year!

01:50.711 --> 01:53.961
Hoo-yeah, and we got such
a good spot to watch it.

01:53.961 --> 01:56.791
What are you jerks
doing in our spot?!

01:56.791 --> 01:58.751
Your spot?
We were here first!

01:58.751 --> 02:00.791
Yeah, I don't see
your name on it.

02:00.791 --> 02:02.831
Well, maybe you
need more eyes.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.711
Hey, back
off my girlfriend, man.

02:05.711 --> 02:07.911
Sounds like this guy's
looking for a fight.

02:07.911 --> 02:10.001
There's only one way
to settle this.

02:11.831 --> 02:13.541
BOTH: Yeah!

02:13.541 --> 02:14.961
MARCO: How are
we settling this?

02:14.961 --> 02:16.751
How are we settling this?

02:16.751 --> 02:19.581
Let's go! Ugh!

02:22.961 --> 02:24.751
MARCO: I got it!
I got it!

02:24.751 --> 02:26.581
Point, Team Ulric.

02:26.581 --> 02:28.711
-Ha ha!
-Yah!

02:31.961 --> 02:32.711
Kelly, it's yours!

02:37.001 --> 02:38.961
-That's cheating!

02:38.961 --> 02:41.211
Hey, your friend
looked upset.

02:41.211 --> 02:43.171
Maybe you should
check on her.

02:43.171 --> 02:46.871
Kelly! Guys,
where did Kelly go?

02:46.871 --> 02:49.371
It's okay. We can
still take these chumps.

02:49.371 --> 02:52.371
Star and I haven't even
unleashed our secret weapon.

02:53.871 --> 02:56.581
Fine. Marco will fix it.

02:59.371 --> 03:00.831
Kelly?

03:00.831 --> 03:02.411
Did you say Skelly?

03:02.411 --> 03:04.331
No, I said Kelly.

03:04.331 --> 03:06.791
What's up with Skelly?
'Cause that's me.

03:06.791 --> 03:10.291
Oh, hey. Hey, there.
I'm Skelly, too.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.001
Have you guys
seen my friend?

03:12.001 --> 03:14.501
I don't know, man,
but I'll fight ya.

03:14.501 --> 03:17.001
I just wanna
find my friend.

03:17.001 --> 03:20.251
She's, like, this tall
and has a lot of body hair.

03:20.251 --> 03:21.671
No?

03:21.671 --> 03:23.291
Sounds like
I could take her.

03:23.291 --> 03:24.831
Two on two sound fair?

03:24.831 --> 03:27.251
Okay, well, uh,
thanks anyway.

03:27.251 --> 03:28.751
He seemed nice.

03:34.041 --> 03:36.001
Are... you okay?

03:36.001 --> 03:37.671
No...

03:37.671 --> 03:40.041
Tad and I broke up.

03:40.041 --> 03:42.121
Oh... sorry.

03:42.121 --> 03:45.121
I-- I mean, you guys
will probably work it out.

03:45.121 --> 03:46.831
You always do, you know.

03:46.831 --> 03:49.911
No. This is
very much the end.

03:49.911 --> 03:53.791
Oh. Well, I know
how you feel.

03:53.791 --> 03:55.671
Jackie and I
split up, too.

03:55.671 --> 03:59.751
Hey, if you need
to talk-- Aah!

03:59.751 --> 04:01.541
( grunts,
yells in retaliation )

04:01.541 --> 04:03.081
Jorby, what
are you doing?

04:03.081 --> 04:05.501
Oh, I don't know, Kelly,
what are you doing?

04:05.501 --> 04:07.411
Is this
your new sparring partner?

04:07.411 --> 04:09.621
You know what?
I had to fight Greg.

04:09.621 --> 04:13.291
Greg! And I killed him
in, like, three seconds!

04:13.291 --> 04:14.751
You didn't kill Greg.

04:14.751 --> 04:16.711
Yeah, well,
I killed his pride.

04:16.711 --> 04:19.211
Leave her alone, man!
She's going through some stuff.

04:19.211 --> 04:22.911
We all are! Everyone's
in a constant state
of falling apart.

04:22.911 --> 04:24.911
Existential war cry!

04:24.911 --> 04:27.911
Does everyone
on this stupid beach
wanna fight?

04:32.871 --> 04:35.961
Stop! I cannot--

04:35.961 --> 04:40.211
I cannot deal with
this much static right now.

04:42.331 --> 04:43.911
Sorry, man, I didn't know.

04:43.911 --> 04:45.291
I'd help you talk to her,

04:45.291 --> 04:47.911
but I got my own lady
I gotta deal with.

04:49.411 --> 04:52.001
I'm coming!
Oh, kill me.

04:52.001 --> 04:53.411
Kelly, wait up!

04:53.411 --> 04:56.121
I just wanted to say
if you need to talk--

04:56.121 --> 04:59.621
I don't know
who I am anymore.

04:59.621 --> 05:03.621
All I know is I'm tired
of being Tad's girlfriend,

05:03.621 --> 05:05.911
and I can't seem to move on.

05:05.911 --> 05:08.041
That stuff takes time.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.911
I know, but--

05:09.911 --> 05:12.961
Tad's still in here.

05:12.961 --> 05:15.751
He'll always be in here,
but it gets eas--

05:15.751 --> 05:17.961
No, Marco, he hasn't
moved out yet.

05:17.961 --> 05:20.751
He's still in here.

05:20.751 --> 05:22.001
Wait, what?

05:22.001 --> 05:23.791
He just isn't getting it,

05:23.791 --> 05:26.501
and I've already hurt
him too much.

05:26.501 --> 05:29.001
I could try talking to him.

05:29.001 --> 05:31.831
Really? Hmm, well.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.211
Maybe he'll
listen to you.

05:33.211 --> 05:35.371
You are
his best friend.

05:35.371 --> 05:37.711
I am?

05:37.711 --> 05:40.041
Come on in.

05:40.041 --> 05:41.461
-Yeah.

05:41.461 --> 05:42.671
-Yeah!

05:42.671 --> 05:46.911
Get in here! Get it?
"Get in hair."

05:55.001 --> 05:57.621
Um, hey, Tad.

05:59.871 --> 06:02.081
Oh, hey, bestie.

06:02.081 --> 06:06.121
Kelly dumped me again.

06:06.121 --> 06:08.911
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.621
She asked me
to come talk to you.

06:10.621 --> 06:12.041
Are we getting
back together?

06:12.041 --> 06:15.081
No. She needs you
to move out, bud.

06:15.081 --> 06:18.041
She keeps saying that,
but I've been looking.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.251
Oh! That's great. Where?

06:20.251 --> 06:24.541
Mm, like, on the back
of these pizza boxes?

06:24.541 --> 06:26.791
Uh, inside these chip bags?

06:26.791 --> 06:29.041
At the bottom
of these soda pops?

06:30.171 --> 06:32.211
Look, dude, I felt
the same way

06:32.211 --> 06:33.671
when Jackie and I split.

06:33.671 --> 06:35.211
That's your B., man.

06:35.211 --> 06:37.621
Kelly and I break up
and make up constantly.

06:37.621 --> 06:39.751
We'll get back together
in no time,

06:39.751 --> 06:43.331
so why even bother
getting out of this chair?

06:43.331 --> 06:46.541
Tad, it's for real this time.

06:46.541 --> 06:49.121
You're harshing
my groove, Marco.

06:49.121 --> 06:52.081
Dude, Kelly wants to move on.
You should give her that chance.

06:52.081 --> 06:54.501
-Come on, man!
-No!

06:54.501 --> 06:58.041
You're just making yourself
miserable hanging around her.

06:58.041 --> 07:01.121
You're right.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.751
You're the expert.

07:02.751 --> 07:05.541
Well, yeah, I'm an expert
in many things

07:05.541 --> 07:06.911
What are you talking about?

07:06.911 --> 07:08.501
How you're making
yourself miserable

07:08.501 --> 07:09.541
hanging around Star.

07:09.541 --> 07:11.251
What?! Psst.

07:11.251 --> 07:13.121
What does Star
have to do with it?

07:13.121 --> 07:15.831
If anything,
I'm miserable because--

07:15.831 --> 07:18.121
because Jackie dumped me.

07:18.121 --> 07:20.581
Marco, you didn't come here
for the Soulrise.

07:20.581 --> 07:22.121
Yes, I did.

07:22.121 --> 07:26.121
Oh, Marco, Marco,
Marco, Marco, Marco...

07:26.121 --> 07:28.541
-Shh.

07:28.541 --> 07:30.411
I've been watching you
all night.

07:30.411 --> 07:32.871
You have feelings
for your best friend, dude.

07:32.871 --> 07:37.541
What?! No! No. No...

07:37.541 --> 07:40.961
Dude, you have
dimensional scissors!

07:40.961 --> 07:43.251
You could be
knocking back soda pops

07:43.251 --> 07:45.831
and crushing pizzas
in any dimension!

07:45.831 --> 07:49.411
And you're choosing
to live with
your unavailable crush.

07:49.411 --> 07:51.411

yourself miserable,
