00:05.012 --> 00:06.112
Previously on E. R.

00:06.213 --> 00:08.842
A year ago I was living with Doug.

00:09.407 --> 00:11.309
Now I'm living alone with two babies.

00:11.310 --> 00:12.310
John.

00:12.977 --> 00:15.652
I wish you'd talk to somebody
about your not sleeping.

00:15.653 --> 00:16.685
I'll be fine.

00:16.686 --> 00:18.152
Hello, David. How are you?

00:18.153 --> 00:20.983
Well, I'm still here, Elizabeth,
it couldn't be too bad.

00:21.284 --> 00:23.794
I mean, this isn't right, Mark.

00:25.281 --> 00:27.960
It just isn't right.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.138
I know, dad.

00:29.139 --> 00:31.712
Nothing has gone as expected today.

00:36.435 --> 00:39.056
E. R. 6x20 "LOOSE ENDS"

00:45.734 --> 00:50.276
Mark. Mark, I'm cold.

00:50.446 --> 00:52.901
All right, Dad.

00:53.448 --> 00:55.357
I'll get you a blanket.

01:01.913 --> 01:05.578
Did you get any sleep? You look awful.

01:05.791 --> 01:10.251
I'm fine. I need to turn up
your oxygen, Dad.

01:11.546 --> 01:14.795
If you have trouble breathing,
I will have to put you on a mask.

01:15.215 --> 01:17.967
- No mask.
- We'll see.

01:18.301 --> 01:22.796
- You ought to go back to work.
- Maybe later.

01:23.138 --> 01:25.047
I wanna make sure
you're comfortable.

01:25.265 --> 01:29.048
- In that case, how about a drink?
- What?

01:29.268 --> 01:34.178
I'm craving a bloody mary.
Your mother made them for brunch.

01:34.689 --> 01:38.603
- That's not a good idea.
- You think it'll kill me?

01:43.237 --> 01:46.771
- With or without Worcestershire?
- Without.

01:49.617 --> 01:52.618
But I'll take a dash of Tabasco.

01:58.750 --> 02:02.996
- What's all the racket?
- Sorry, trying to get back into shape.

02:03.211 --> 02:08.038
- When did you get this equipment?
- Couple of days ago.

02:08.257 --> 02:11.590
- Didn't mean to wake you.
- No, I'm up with the birds.

02:11.802 --> 02:14.126
- How'd you sleep?
- Like a baby.

02:14.304 --> 02:17.636
Good. You can get back to
your regimen.

02:18.182 --> 02:20.802
Toast and coffee for breakfast?

02:22.393 --> 02:27.303
- I feel like pancakes today.
- I think we can manage that.

02:33.485 --> 02:36.320
- Morning.
- Morning.

02:36.821 --> 02:40.652
Everything all right?
I only get your answering machine.

02:40.866 --> 02:45.159
Sorry. It's been crazy.
Tess had a bad cold.

02:45.328 --> 02:48.328
The kitchen's being painted.
We're at my mom's.

02:48.497 --> 02:51.912
Well, anyway, happy birthday.

02:55.836 --> 02:57.875
They're beautiful.

02:58.296 --> 03:02.792
I picked them from my garden.
My neighbor's garden, actually.

03:03.550 --> 03:07.594
- How'd you know it's my birthday?
- I have my ways.

03:15.435 --> 03:18.554
Dr. Kovac, we need you.
GSW coming in.

03:20.522 --> 03:22.016
- See you later.
- Okay.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:19.860 --> 04:24.568
- Looking sharp. Where you been?
- Checking out Lincoln Park condos.

04:24.781 --> 04:26.607
- Trendy.
- And expensive.

04:26.824 --> 04:29.493
- Too many yuppies.
- You're a yuppie.

04:29.701 --> 04:32.192
- No way.
- Young urban professional. That's you.

04:32.412 --> 04:36.907
- I am not. Am I a Yuppie?
- No, but you will be when you grow up.

04:37.124 --> 04:41.915
Dr. Greene won't be in tonight.
I need someone to cover his shift.

04:42.086 --> 04:44.292
- All night?
- You can flip for it.

04:44.505 --> 04:45.833
- I'll do it.
- You will?

04:46.048 --> 04:48.882
As senior Resident, I'm responsible.

04:49.092 --> 04:51.962
Thank you. You can nap later.
Malucci will cover you.

04:52.177 --> 04:55.343
- Your EMS meeting's at 10.
- This morning?

04:55.555 --> 04:57.880
- Where's Carol?
- Over there.

05:03.728 --> 05:05.601
- You didn't hear me calling?
- What's up?

05:05.771 --> 05:08.725
I need the paramedic compliance data.

05:08.941 --> 05:12.772
- I'll get to it.
- I put a memo in your box.

05:12.944 --> 05:15.861
- You didn't see it?
- I must've forgot.

05:16.071 --> 05:19.107
The meeting's in two hours.
I need that data.

05:19.282 --> 05:20.610
I will. I will get to it.

05:20.783 --> 05:22.407
- You'll do it?
- I will do it.

05:26.371 --> 05:28.612
I made you French toast.

05:32.084 --> 05:33.827
You want the TV on?

05:34.586 --> 05:35.961
No.

05:38.214 --> 05:39.542
Lean forward.

05:42.008 --> 05:45.626
- You in pain?
- When I take a breath.

05:47.596 --> 05:50.964
Probably pleurisy from the pneumonia.

05:51.808 --> 05:53.634
We'll try Toradol.

05:56.061 --> 05:58.100
This'll make you feel better.

06:03.275 --> 06:06.026
- Hungry?
- No.

06:06.986 --> 06:08.563
Why don't you eat?

06:10.155 --> 06:11.779
For me.

06:15.034 --> 06:18.034
Just take one bite, please?

06:20.997 --> 06:22.740
I'll eat.

06:31.297 --> 06:32.672
What'd you give him?

06:32.840 --> 06:34.666
- Lasix, nitro and morphine.
- Excellent.

06:34.841 --> 06:37.166
He's acidemic and retaining CO-2.

06:37.385 --> 06:42.046
- His pulse ox is dropping. 85.
- Set us up for an intubation.

06:42.264 --> 06:47.174
- We'll put a tube down your throat.
- Anything to help me breathe.

06:48.352 --> 06:51.934
This one's tough.
Have you done a COPDer before?

06:52.147 --> 06:55.313
- I've never tubed.
- Time to step up to the plate.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.772
A patient's in respiratory distress?

06:57.984 --> 07:00.938
On top of it.
I'm going to teach Abby intubation.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.858
We can try this new Airway Cam.

07:04.031 --> 07:07.944
If you don't mind,
slip this around your head.

07:08.159 --> 07:11.029
As she intubates, we can see...

07:11.203 --> 07:15.911
...exactly what she sees on the TV
and make adjustments.

07:16.374 --> 07:19.208
Cool. You ready, Abby?

07:21.211 --> 07:25.539
Give your patient 20 of etomidate
and start bagging him.

07:25.756 --> 07:27.547
Right.

07:27.716 --> 07:31.547
- Everything looks okay.
- No bleeding?

07:31.719 --> 07:33.427
I can go home.

07:33.512 --> 07:35.837
You vomited blood. Fainted at work.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.965
The IV needs to stay in a bit longer.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.230
You said I could leave
if everything checked out.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.808
Yes, but your potassium level's low.
We need to replenish it.

07:42.920 --> 07:46.624
- Where'd you put the lab slip?
- I got it off the computer.

07:47.031 --> 07:51.727
You've wasted enough of my time.
Nurse, get my clothes.

07:52.077 --> 07:57.234
- What's wrong?
- Just dizzy from sitting up too fast.

07:57.406 --> 08:01.901
You're dehydrated. You can go
after this fluid runs in.

08:02.118 --> 08:05.985
All right. But that's it.
Then I'm out of here.

08:06.830 --> 08:10.448
Can you make sure her discharge
papers are in order?

08:10.666 --> 08:11.995
Sure.

08:14.586 --> 08:18.085
Her gag's absent, her tooth enamel's
eroded, she's severely malnourished.

08:18.256 --> 08:20.178
She's anorectic and bulimic.
And I don't want her leaving.

08:20.191 --> 08:24.090
- What can we do?
- We'll have Psych put a hold on her.

08:25.328 --> 08:26.359
What is it?

08:26.454 --> 08:28.795
Hammer vs. scalp. We're going to CT.

08:29.014 --> 08:31.469
- Seen Carol?
- Not since this morning.

08:31.483 --> 08:34.138
- I need data from her.
- Page her?

08:34.152 --> 08:36.344
- Twice.
- It's her birthday.

08:36.562 --> 08:41.472
- Maybe she went out for breakfast.
- I certainly hope not.

08:43.317 --> 08:45.356
All right. Go for it.

08:45.569 --> 08:50.313
Enter on the right and sweep
the tongue to the left.

08:52.408 --> 08:54.151
Slide it all the way down.

08:54.367 --> 08:58.779
Hold on. Advance slowly
until you see the epiglottis.

08:59.663 --> 09:01.122
- See it.
- So can we.

09:01.623 --> 09:06.533
- A little more. Lift it with your tip.
- This is pretty cool.

09:07.461 --> 09:10.130
No, lift toward the handle.

09:10.964 --> 09:13.086
You could have fun with this.

09:13.299 --> 09:16.050
- See the vocal cords.
- Pass the tube.

09:19.721 --> 09:21.049
Good.

09:22.223 --> 09:24.678
- Wasn't hard.
- Easy with a good teacher.

09:25.142 --> 09:26.552
You're right.

09:28.728 --> 09:33.056
You're wheezing again.
Want another breathing treatment?

09:36.317 --> 09:38.309
Having any chest pain?

09:38.819 --> 09:43.445
No. That last stuff
worked pretty good.

09:45.074 --> 09:47.778
Just mixing up your antibiotics.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.910
- Damn it!
- What?

09:59.127 --> 10:00.502
Broke.

10:03.005 --> 10:06.040
- Now what?
- Cut my hand.

10:06.257 --> 10:09.127
- You're bleeding on the floor.
- I know.

10:09.343 --> 10:12.676
- You should keep pressure on that.
- I know.

10:12.887 --> 10:16.671
Keep your hand above your heart
to stop the bleeding.

10:16.849 --> 10:21.344
- You need stitches.
- I won't leave you here alone.

10:22.311 --> 10:23.936
You're the doctor.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.188
Your leg's circulation is poor.

10:30.401 --> 10:33.485
An arteriogram will check
your blood flow.

10:33.695 --> 10:36.565
When he came, the doc couldn't feel
a pulse in his foot.

10:36.781 --> 10:40.031
- When was that?
- About a month ago, right?

10:40.951 --> 10:45.030
The doc took the dead skin off his toe,
gave him some ointment.

10:45.204 --> 10:50.161
- My shoe fit poorly. Rubbed my toe raw.
- The toe's gangrenous.

10:51.001 --> 10:53.538
Your leg has an ulceration.

10:56.547 --> 10:59.381
- We must operate.
- How bad is it?

11:00.341 --> 11:03.258
We have to amputate below the knee.

11:03.719 --> 11:05.925
- Amputate?
- How could this happen?

11:06.138 --> 11:09.221
That first doctor gave my dad
some pills.

11:09.390 --> 11:12.390
- How could it be so serious?
- Remember the doctor?

11:12.559 --> 11:14.717
Some foreign guy.

11:14.936 --> 11:18.554
- Kovac?
- Yeah. Dr. Kovac.

11:20.315 --> 11:22.604
- I'm off to Mark's.
- Is it his dad?

11:22.817 --> 11:26.399
No. Mark cut his hand.
He needs sutures.

11:26.570 --> 11:30.069
- Make sure Psych sees Claire.
- She won't leave.

11:30.281 --> 11:33.068
She's on a slow drip.
She's got hours left on that bag.

11:33.284 --> 11:36.901
- Thanks.
- I'm still massaging the data.

11:37.120 --> 11:40.738
I'll have to make
the presentation in June.

11:41.415 --> 11:44.748
- Where were you?
- Daycare. Tess is cranky.

11:44.918 --> 11:47.290
I postponed my meeting.
I didn't have your report.

11:47.462 --> 11:51.708
- I didn't finish it.
- You need to stay on top of the stats.

11:51.923 --> 11:55.374
- I'm just incredibly busy.
- Give it to another nurse.

11:55.593 --> 11:58.926
- I can handle it.
- Your babies take a lot of time.

11:59.096 --> 12:01.337
- If you need to cut back-
- I'm fine.

12:01.556 --> 12:04.391
Things can't fall through the cracks.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.758
- I can handle it.
- Good.

12:08.937 --> 12:12.222
- What?
- Delivery guy dropped this off.

12:20.404 --> 12:24.780
- God! It's from Doug.
- Let's see. What'd he give you?

12:29.161 --> 12:31.996
- Animal crackers.
- A weird birthday present.

12:34.957 --> 12:37.245
It's a thing we used to do.

12:37.459 --> 12:41.456
When he'd go to the store,
he came back with animal crackers.

12:41.671 --> 12:46.415
- I'd put one in his Christmas stocking.
- Kind of a tradition?

12:54.056 --> 12:57.305
- I'll do the foreign body in the eye.
- Carter got it.

12:57.517 --> 13:00.303
- I'll take the hip dislocation.
- Carter got it.

13:00.519 --> 13:04.136
Tell him, if he wants to see
all the patients, I can go home.

13:04.314 --> 13:07.065
He left you Mr. Barclay. Wound check.

13:07.233 --> 13:08.561
Swell.

13:09.651 --> 13:11.275
- Mr. Barclay?
- Finally.

13:11.486 --> 13:14.486
I've waited here for three hours.

13:14.655 --> 13:16.694
Your CHF guy dropped his sats.

13:16.782 --> 13:18.062
You must go back to Chairs.

13:18.283 --> 13:20.820
- What's taking so long?
- My patient's not breathing.

13:21.035 --> 13:22.529
- Would you take him?
- Sure.

13:22.745 --> 13:25.780
I burnt my arm cleaning out
a furnace.

13:25.997 --> 13:27.705
Remove the gauze and-

13:27.915 --> 13:30.204
- Hey, doc.
- Excuse me.

13:30.417 --> 13:34.249
Kenny's been seizing for 20 minutes.

13:34.462 --> 13:36.787
- Please help him.
- Don't worry.

13:37.006 --> 13:40.125
We'll take good care of him.
Prep the Pedes ER.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.339
Hey, I was here first!

13:42.552 --> 13:46.086
- Ativan's on board.
- Draw a CBC, lytes and cath a urine.

13:46.305 --> 13:49.922
- Pulse ox is dropping, 92.
- Has he had seizures before?

13:50.141 --> 13:52.050
- No.
- He's always been perfectly healthy.

13:52.268 --> 13:56.312
- Could he have ingested poison?
- We keep everything locked up.

13:56.521 --> 13:59.854
- He had a sore throat last night.
- Fever this morning?

14:00.024 --> 14:02.977
Just a little. I tried to get him to eat,
he wanted to sleep.

14:03.193 --> 14:05.020
Next thing I knew, he was shaking.

14:05.195 --> 14:07.899
Push 600 of phenobarb.
We must stop it.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.485
- You want to intubate?
- If his sats keep dropping.

14:10.657 --> 14:14.488
- Blood glucose is really low. Under 40.
- Seizures can lower blood sugar.

14:14.660 --> 14:18.871
Push 50 cc's of D-25
and get Weaver now.

14:19.873 --> 14:22.031
- Dr. Kovac?
- Yes.

14:22.208 --> 14:25.576
Do you remember Chet Fulton?
African-American, early 60s.

14:25.753 --> 14:29.251
Last month. Had vascular insufficiency
and an ulcerated toe.

14:29.464 --> 14:34.172
- Do you have his chart?
- Yeah. He's back with gangrene.

14:35.343 --> 14:40.503
I remember him. I débrided the wound
and gave him Trental. Sorry he's back.

14:40.723 --> 14:43.842
Well, now I have to do
a below-the-knee amputation.

14:44.059 --> 14:47.059
It may have been avoided
if he went to Vascular clinic.

14:47.228 --> 14:49.434
The chart shows I made the referral.

14:49.646 --> 14:53.311
High-risk patients with no
insurance need follow-up.

14:53.524 --> 14:56.275
And I made an appointment
with Vascular.

14:56.443 --> 14:58.685
I can't see to his care
outside the ER.

14:58.862 --> 15:02.195
But did you put him on the callback list
or phone him?

15:02.365 --> 15:06.029
- Do you call back everyone you see?
- The high-risk ones I do.

15:06.243 --> 15:07.274
Really?

15:07.452 --> 15:11.235
Older African-American men
are at high-risk for amputation.

15:11.413 --> 15:12.991
- You should know that.
- I do.

15:13.206 --> 15:15.744
- Then why didn't you call him?
- What are you saying?

15:15.959 --> 15:19.623
There's more to the emergency medicine
than treating and streeting patients.

15:19.837 --> 15:22.409
That's one more thing
you don't have to teach me.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.797
- How long's he been seizing?
- Thirty minutes.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.637
Dilantin, 300 mg. His blood sugar?

15:30.845 --> 15:33.466
- Still under 40.
- Push another 50 of D-25.

15:33.639 --> 15:35.927
I don't understand.
Why's the glucose so low?

15:36.141 --> 15:39.094
Could be an insulinoma
or a metabolic disorder.

15:39.269 --> 15:43.182
Give me an ammonia,
an insulin level and a uric acid.

15:43.355 --> 15:46.770
- Seizure stopped.
- Start a dextrose drip.

15:46.941 --> 15:50.392
Check blood sugar every 20 minutes.
He can't tolerate another seizure.

15:50.569 --> 15:52.063
Why isn't he awake?

15:53.446 --> 15:56.151
It's normal for him to sleep
after something like this.

15:56.365 --> 15:59.615
- He will wake up, right?
- Why not stay with him?

15:59.785 --> 16:03.235
He might be scared waking
in a strange place.

16:03.454 --> 16:06.241
- Thanks.
- Thank you, doctor.

16:10.460 --> 16:12.950
- Get a head CT and an EEG.
- What do you think?

16:13.170 --> 16:17.582
I don't know. D-25 should've
corrected the hypoglycemia.

16:17.799 --> 16:20.965
Check the labs
and start hunting for zebras.

16:21.135 --> 16:22.629
Okay.

16:24.304 --> 16:27.553
- Is this your patient?
- No, he's Carol's.

16:27.765 --> 16:32.307
- Can you change the IV bag?
- I got a guy puking in Exam Two.

16:33.019 --> 16:34.347
Carol.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.770
- Your patient needs a new IV.
- Right.

16:45.070 --> 16:49.980
- The IV ran dry. That's not like you.
- I'm sorry.

16:50.783 --> 16:52.859
- Something wrong?
- I'm fine.

16:53.035 --> 16:56.070
- Are you sure?
- You have a problem with me? Say it.

16:56.287 --> 16:59.074
Don't get defensive.
I'm just asking what's going on.

16:59.832 --> 17:03.165
I'm caring for 10 patients,
my babies are in daycare.

17:03.335 --> 17:05.705
And you're constantly on my back.

17:05.920 --> 17:09.204
Stay on top of things
and I won't bother you.

17:13.342 --> 17:15.963
Forty-five-year-old guy
tried to beat the El train.

17:16.178 --> 17:17.720
Knocked down, but not run over.

17:17.929 --> 17:20.846
BP's 80 over 40.
Intubated in the field.

17:21.015 --> 17:24.015
When is somebody gonna look
at my arm? I came here on the bus-

17:24.184 --> 17:27.635
Would you sit down?
And three...

17:29.188 --> 17:32.521
- Got some rib fractures.
- BP's 75 palp.

17:32.691 --> 17:35.940
Prep for a central line.
This guy's gonna need some fluid.

17:36.152 --> 17:38.986
Absent breath sounds on the left. This
dude's got a pneumo. Chest-tube tray.

17:39.196 --> 17:42.564
- Hold on.
- Why can't I get a wound check?

17:42.782 --> 17:45.735
This guy's trying to die.
Get out of here!

17:45.910 --> 17:48.482
I'll pop this in and his pressure
will shoot back up.

17:48.703 --> 17:51.372
Don't assume that.
He may be losing blood.

17:51.539 --> 17:53.994
Malik, stand by to resuscitate.

17:54.208 --> 17:57.541
- Did I ever tell you the story-?
- I'd love to, but sick people await.

17:57.752 --> 18:01.120
Cliff-diver hit the rocks.
I'm in. You done?

18:01.297 --> 18:03.040
- Not yet.
- Pressure still 75.

18:03.215 --> 18:04.839
So much for your chest tube.

18:05.050 --> 18:07.374
May be blood in the belly.
Get an ultrasound.

18:07.593 --> 18:09.217
- He stole my rig!
- Who?

18:09.428 --> 18:12.049
- Your wound-check patient.
- That sucks.

18:17.434 --> 18:21.052
- You're good at this.
- Thank you.

18:21.563 --> 18:25.559
The way you did it,
you hardly need to close the skin.

18:25.774 --> 18:27.601
That's the point.

18:27.817 --> 18:31.067
Is he giving you a hard time
over there?

18:31.237 --> 18:34.819
No, he's being a very good patient.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.701
We'll remove those in five days.
Shouldn't leave a scar.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.485
Thanks.

18:44.873 --> 18:49.201
Keep it dry for two days.
Put a plastic bag on it when you shower.

18:49.876 --> 18:51.916
- I know.
- I know you know.

18:56.298 --> 18:58.753
His breathing's difficult.

18:59.301 --> 19:01.791
Should I treat him?

19:02.011 --> 19:04.133
I can't breathe.

19:04.346 --> 19:08.010
But I can still hear
every word you say.

19:09.934 --> 19:12.934
- Can I make you lunch?
- I'm not hungry.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.770
But stay. Have some tea.

19:21.193 --> 19:22.651
I'd like that.

19:26.989 --> 19:30.108
- Heard your patient's unstable.
- Blunt chest trauma.

19:30.325 --> 19:33.775
- Hypotensive despite a chest tube.
- Probably cracked his spleen.

19:33.953 --> 19:37.700
His neck veins are elevated.
May be fluid around the heart.

19:37.872 --> 19:41.075
- Could be the belly.
- Check for a cardiac tamponade.

19:41.292 --> 19:44.292
- I'd check the belly.
- Carter's right.

19:44.503 --> 19:46.874
He's got an effusion around the heart.
Go for it.

19:47.046 --> 19:51.458
- Get me a spinal needle.
- Now you can check the belly.

19:51.633 --> 19:53.376
Watch for injury current.

19:53.593 --> 19:57.804
- Looks pretty clean.
- You hit the heart. Pull back.

19:59.097 --> 20:03.805
- I've got good return.
- Pulse is stronger.

20:03.976 --> 20:08.305
- Need another syringe?
- I'm okay. Call for an ICU bed.

20:09.856 --> 20:12.144
Good job, Carter.

20:13.942 --> 20:15.271
- Dr. Weaver?
- Yeah.

20:15.444 --> 20:18.112
I did a Medline search
on the boy with seizures.

20:18.321 --> 20:24.025
His symptoms are consistent
with M-CAD, a rare metabolic disorder.

20:24.242 --> 20:27.860
Get a Genetics consult.
Talk to the parents. Good pickup.

20:29.913 --> 20:32.320
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

20:33.041 --> 20:37.417
Look. I'm sorry I came down
so hard on you...

20:37.836 --> 20:41.833
- ... but I depend on you.
- I need to be more on top of things.

20:43.090 --> 20:46.340
You're our best nurse,
but something's going on with you.

20:46.510 --> 20:49.083
Can I do anything to help?

20:49.762 --> 20:53.711
Not really. I just need time
to figure a few things out.

20:53.932 --> 20:57.929
I've worked with you for five years.
I know you.

21:04.816 --> 21:06.689
I hate my life.

21:08.444 --> 21:11.527
I mean, I love my work.

21:12.113 --> 21:14.604
And I love my daughters, but...

21:16.909 --> 21:20.656
How did I end up raising twins
by myself? It's just...

21:26.082 --> 21:31.039
I think you need some time.
You have some sick days.

21:31.211 --> 21:35.754
- I've used them all up.
- Check. You have some extras.

21:36.674 --> 21:38.583
Use them whenever you like.

21:41.011 --> 21:42.718
Thank you.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.888
You said Kenny would wake up.

21:57.232 --> 22:01.478
His genetic disorder prevents
his burning fat for energy.

22:01.694 --> 22:06.070
When he got sick, his blood sugar
dropped, causing his seizure.

22:06.239 --> 22:09.239
- Will he have brain damage?
- We'll look at the EEG.

22:09.408 --> 22:13.072
I don't understand. He was born here.
They didn't tell us he had this.

22:13.244 --> 22:17.822
Chicago hospitals don't test
for rare metabolic disorders.

22:17.940 --> 22:21.189
- Do other hospitals?
- In some states.

22:21.259 --> 22:24.032
If we'd known,
could we have done anything?

22:26.421 --> 22:30.253
Dr. Chen, please. Tell us.

22:31.717 --> 22:34.801
If he had sugar water
when he got sick...

22:34.970 --> 22:37.460
...you could have prevented
the seizure.

22:37.639 --> 22:40.425
- Sugar water?
- Oh, my God!

22:46.937 --> 22:50.769
- Our patient's in the O.R.
- Did you cause myocardial damage?

22:50.982 --> 22:53.224
Not to worry.
Easy as threading a needle.

22:53.443 --> 22:57.107
Hello? I'm in the ambulance,
bringing in sick people.

22:57.321 --> 22:59.609
- What unit is this?
- How should I know?

22:59.823 --> 23:02.776
I was flagged down
on my way to Mercy.

23:02.950 --> 23:04.574
- Who is this?
- Joe Barclay.

23:04.785 --> 23:08.200
- It's your wound-check guy!
- What are you doing?

23:08.413 --> 23:12.160
Heading back.
I got people here puking their guts out.

23:12.374 --> 23:15.291
- Is that the thief?
- Are the patients stable?

23:15.460 --> 23:19.788
- I don't know, man. They're puking.
- Not on the floor. I just cleaned it!

23:20.005 --> 23:24.049
I'm gonna let you take this one.
You've already established a relationship.

23:24.258 --> 23:27.508
- Call me if there's any change.
- I will.

23:30.805 --> 23:34.636
David, I'm leaving.
I have to get back to the hospital.

23:34.808 --> 23:39.185
- A doctor's work is never done.
- I'm afraid so.

23:39.771 --> 23:44.147
Wait. I have something
I want to give you.

23:44.358 --> 23:49.517
Mark, get that little green box
from the top dresser drawer.

23:49.695 --> 23:52.648
- It's not necessary.
- I know.

23:55.033 --> 23:57.948
These belonged to Mark's mother.

23:58.301 --> 24:01.568
I gave them to her on her wedding day.

24:01.788 --> 24:03.614
I want you to have them.

24:05.708 --> 24:07.036
I can't.

24:11.504 --> 24:13.163
Please.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.093
They're lovely.

24:23.221 --> 24:24.252
Thank you.

24:26.015 --> 24:29.680
Don't just stand there.
Help her put them on.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.064
She looks...

24:45.697 --> 24:48.069
...beautiful, doesn't she, Mark?

24:49.200 --> 24:51.738
Yeah. She does.

25:01.043 --> 25:03.794
- Hello, Jing.
- No, it's Jing-Mei.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.624
What's the matter? Somebody die?

25:06.839 --> 25:10.041
We should screen babies
for rare metabolic disorders.

25:10.258 --> 25:13.175
- What?
- I cared for a little boy today.

25:13.386 --> 25:16.836
He seized because we didn't give him
a $25 test when he was born.

25:17.055 --> 25:19.628
Well, if we tested for every
genetic disorder...

25:19.849 --> 25:23.680
...we'd spend millions to identify
a tiny handful of kids.

25:24.311 --> 25:27.311
But if I'd known what he had,
I'd have treated him differently.

25:27.522 --> 25:29.680
I might have stopped the seizure
more quickly.

25:29.857 --> 25:34.933
It's all an allocation of precious
resources. We have to draw a line.

25:35.153 --> 25:38.070
- We should offer the tests.
- We can't afford it.

25:38.239 --> 25:41.025
Tell that to my patient's family.

25:41.241 --> 25:45.404
They're waiting to see
if their son comes out of a coma.

25:48.205 --> 25:51.158
- They wouldn't stop puking.
- Strong radial pulse.

25:51.374 --> 25:53.247
- This guy is stable.
- Soft on this one.

25:53.459 --> 25:55.416
We got a father/daughter MVA.
Can you give me a hand?

25:55.586 --> 25:58.669
Start a liter of saline and titrate
five to 10 of Compazine.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.789
- Let's go.
- Come with me.

26:01.006 --> 26:03.248
- Can I get my wound checked?
- Oh, yeah.

26:03.467 --> 26:05.673
Rear-ended while at a red light.

26:05.885 --> 26:08.423
Six-year-old girl
complains of neck pain.

26:08.637 --> 26:12.006
- I want to stay with my daddy.
- Dr. Dave will take care of you.

26:12.224 --> 26:13.848
I'll take the dad.

26:14.058 --> 26:18.304
35-year-old male, no seat belt.
Knee versus dashboard, facial lac.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.975
- Wife informed?
- Divorced. She's in Pittsburgh.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.974
- Daughter's visiting.
- Dislocated knee.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.437
- Pain's horrible.
- Had six of MS.

26:25.651 --> 26:27.026
Ten of morphine.

26:27.235 --> 26:30.319
Ever reduced a patella?
You will now.

26:35.117 --> 26:36.943
Did you see my patient?

26:37.118 --> 26:39.525
- I'm finishing the note.
- Thank you.

26:39.745 --> 26:43.160
Don't thank me.
I'm removing the Psych hold.

26:43.373 --> 26:46.124
You can't be serious.
She's starving herself to death.

26:46.334 --> 26:49.038
She might be. But I can't
make her stay against her will.

26:49.211 --> 26:53.160
She's got a job, she's not an
immediate threat to herself or anybody.

26:53.339 --> 26:56.707
She could go into kidney failure.
What's it take to get her treatment?

26:56.884 --> 26:59.967
Her consent. Many people do bad
things to themselves.

27:00.136 --> 27:04.714
They smoke, they drink, eat fatty foods,
but we don't lock them up.

27:04.890 --> 27:08.803
- So we do nothing?
- It's her right to decide herself.

27:08.976 --> 27:13.803
- Even if they're bad ones.
- There must be something I can do.

27:14.022 --> 27:17.058
If you convince her to stay,
I'll admit her.

27:17.275 --> 27:20.192
Otherwise,
you'll have to discharge her.

27:22.987 --> 27:24.861
Is the water too warm?

27:25.281 --> 27:27.606
No, no.

27:30.493 --> 27:36.281
- Where's Elizabeth?
- She left a couple of hours ago.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.789
Do you have to go to work?

27:41.002 --> 27:44.085
No, Dad. I'm gonna stay right here.

27:45.088 --> 27:46.961
Okay? Here.

27:48.007 --> 27:49.798
Lie back.

27:50.009 --> 27:54.052
- Having any pain?
- No. No.

27:58.307 --> 28:00.346
You all right?

28:01.184 --> 28:02.726
Yeah.

28:05.980 --> 28:07.521
You look tired.

28:11.484 --> 28:14.354
What is that soap?

28:16.112 --> 28:21.354
- Plain old Ivory.
- That's what your mother used.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.489
I remember.

28:26.871 --> 28:30.037
Every night when she tucked me in...

28:30.207 --> 28:34.915
...she'd kiss me
and I could smell the soap on her face.

28:37.129 --> 28:41.292
- This used to be my job.
- What's that?

28:42.133 --> 28:46.960
Giving you a bath
when you were a baby.

28:49.847 --> 28:51.389
I didn't know that.

28:54.476 --> 28:56.468
You're a good doctor.

28:59.772 --> 29:02.523
The day you became a doctor...

29:03.817 --> 29:07.149
...was the proudest day of my life.

29:12.031 --> 29:15.649
It's okay, Dad.
You don't have to talk.

29:19.537 --> 29:22.538
I love you, Mark.

29:26.668 --> 29:30.285
I love you too, Dad.

29:40.137 --> 29:43.090
- You okay?
- Yeah. When can I get up?

29:43.306 --> 29:47.054
- After I see your x-ray.
- Get a CBC, dip a urine...

29:47.267 --> 29:50.386
- ... check a bedside crit.
- HemoCue's next door.

29:50.603 --> 29:52.679
- That's two of Versed.
- He's pretty relaxed.

29:52.897 --> 29:54.770
I'll keep the hip flexed.

29:54.982 --> 29:59.144
Keeping the knee extended,
apply gentle pressure medially.

29:59.360 --> 30:00.854
Like this?

30:01.570 --> 30:03.646
Perfect. How you guys doing?

30:03.739 --> 30:06.490
She's stable. Clearing the neck.

30:08.284 --> 30:10.821
- What is it?
- Six-year-old, minor MVA.

30:11.036 --> 30:14.535
Probably just whiplash.
I took a lateral C-spine.

30:14.747 --> 30:16.371
Careful.

30:17.249 --> 30:18.743
- Don't!
- It's okay.

30:18.917 --> 30:22.665
We have to examine you.
We'll cover you with a sheet.

30:25.130 --> 30:26.161
What is it?

30:26.340 --> 30:28.960
She has bruised thighs
and bloody underpants.

30:29.175 --> 30:31.879
Could be a urethral injury
from a pelvic fracture?

30:32.094 --> 30:34.217
We need a plain film
and a cystourethrogram.

30:34.388 --> 30:35.716
Hold on.

30:36.931 --> 30:40.216
- Does this hurt, sweetheart?
- No.

30:41.351 --> 30:43.842
There's no pelvic fracture.

30:45.813 --> 30:49.146
You have bloody underpants.
Were you hurt?

30:49.358 --> 30:50.686
I want to go home.

30:55.696 --> 30:57.154
We're here to help you.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.108
I need to ask you
a few questions, okay?

31:03.285 --> 31:05.028
Okay.

31:06.955 --> 31:09.445
Has anyone touched you
where you go to the bathroom?

31:13.126 --> 31:14.537
What happened?

31:14.919 --> 31:20.161
Sometimes my daddy
plays a game with me.

31:26.262 --> 31:28.337
It's okay. You can tell us.

31:31.349 --> 31:33.341
It hurts.

31:34.518 --> 31:37.721
Well, don't worry,
he's never gonna hurt you again, okay?

31:44.318 --> 31:46.144
- Sick son of a bitch.
- Take it easy!

31:46.319 --> 31:48.525
- What are you doing?
- He molested his daughter!

31:48.696 --> 31:50.273
- What?
- She's got sign of abuse.

31:50.447 --> 31:51.775
What? I never touched her!

31:51.990 --> 31:56.947
Mr. Burke, I'm sorry. Dave, outside!
Keep an eye on things.

31:58.996 --> 32:00.988
- You can't do that!
- He raped her!

32:01.206 --> 32:04.159
You don't know. Call Social Services.
Have Cleo do a pelvic.

32:04.333 --> 32:05.792
- I'll assist.
- Not after that.

32:06.001 --> 32:08.289
- That little girl trusts me.
- That's a bad idea.

32:08.461 --> 32:10.454
Well, I'm gonna assist.

32:14.216 --> 32:16.706
Okay, you'll feel a little sting.

32:18.052 --> 32:21.670
- Kerry was out for your blood?
- She was upset.

32:21.847 --> 32:25.215
- I can talk to her.
- No, we worked it out.

32:25.433 --> 32:28.884
You'd think she'd cut you slack
on your birthday.

32:30.520 --> 32:33.058
Do you have plans to celebrate?

32:33.273 --> 32:37.519
No. I don't like leaving the girls
when I've been working all day.

32:37.693 --> 32:41.737
No problem.
I can cook you a birthday dinner.

32:41.904 --> 32:43.731
Even do the dishes.

32:47.367 --> 32:51.695
Okay. Better get these things
to the lab.

32:55.582 --> 32:58.582
- Dr. Chen?
- Is everything okay?

32:58.793 --> 33:02.291
I'm told that Kenny may have
permanent brain damage.

33:03.380 --> 33:04.708
I'm so sorry.

33:06.382 --> 33:08.872
This is Kenny's baby sister.

33:09.384 --> 33:12.135
- The sitter dropped her off.
- She's beautiful.

33:13.262 --> 33:17.674
I want you to give her the test
you talked about.

33:18.350 --> 33:19.844
Please.

33:22.770 --> 33:26.434
I can't force her to stay.
I hope she'll listen to you.

33:26.648 --> 33:30.858
- I'd do anything to help my daughter.
- I'm sure you would.

33:32.861 --> 33:35.233
She's exhausted from not eating.

33:35.446 --> 33:37.024
My God!

33:37.531 --> 33:39.737
She's skin and bones.

33:43.161 --> 33:46.031
- You told the mother?
- I had no choice.

33:46.247 --> 33:47.657
She's over 18.

33:47.873 --> 33:51.241
She has a disease.
I had to do something.

33:55.420 --> 33:58.789
"I would not like them here or there.
I would not like them anywhere."

33:59.007 --> 34:04.082
"I do not like green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-I-am."

34:04.261 --> 34:06.549
You're gonna feel my hands now.

34:07.889 --> 34:12.135
"Would you like them in a house?
Would you like them with a mouse?

34:12.350 --> 34:16.050
I do not like them in a house.
I do not like them with a mouse."

34:16.270 --> 34:19.603
"I do not like them here or there.
I do not like them anywhere."

34:19.815 --> 34:22.304
- That's good.
- Almost through.

34:23.984 --> 34:27.103
She has bleeding from complete
transection of her hymen.

34:33.951 --> 34:38.078
- Can we keep reading?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

34:38.286 --> 34:43.244
"I do not like green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-I-am."

36:20.076 --> 36:23.325
Want to order dinner?
Going to Lucky Moon.

36:23.537 --> 36:28.114
Get me kung pao chicken, mu shu pork
and a side of egg rolls.

36:28.332 --> 36:30.657
- You're hungry!
- I'll save the mu shu for later-

36:30.876 --> 36:35.122
65-year-old with chest pain.
Pressure dropped to 80.

36:35.338 --> 36:40.248
- ST elevation in V-1 through V-4.
- I'll tube him.

36:40.467 --> 36:42.708
- Start dopamine.
- Pulse ox 82.

36:42.885 --> 36:43.916
I'll bag him.

36:44.136 --> 36:47.504
- Want me to call the cath lab?
- Tell them we've got a hot Ml.

36:47.722 --> 36:50.888
- He's tachy at 130.
- Get me some suction.

36:51.058 --> 36:54.889
- Want cricoid pressure?
- Your bee sting kid's crashing.

36:55.103 --> 36:57.142
- I'm in.
- Want me to take it?

36:57.355 --> 37:02.016
No. Get this guy's pressure up
and take him to the cath lab.

37:02.192 --> 37:04.517
Pressure is down.
Should I increase the dopamine?

37:04.694 --> 37:07.231
No. I hear a pansystolic murmur.

37:07.404 --> 37:10.938
- Mitral regurge?
- He has a parasternal thrill.

37:11.116 --> 37:14.733
Could be a septal perforation.
Get an 8 French.

37:14.952 --> 37:16.991
- Central line?
- I'll float a Swan.

37:17.162 --> 37:19.450
- We don't do those.
- We have no Swan modules.

37:19.664 --> 37:22.036
- Get one from the ICU.
- It's against policy.

37:22.208 --> 37:26.619
I need to sample blood
from the right side of his heart.

37:26.836 --> 37:28.295
Carter, we can't do this.

37:29.171 --> 37:33.714
- Fine. I'll do it myself.
- I'm getting Dr. Kovac.

37:36.594 --> 37:40.128
- Did someone page me?
- I did.

37:40.639 --> 37:43.094
Mark's father passed away
a little while ago.

37:45.017 --> 37:46.392
How's Mark?

37:46.602 --> 37:51.559
He's all right. He'll call you
after the funeral home leaves.

37:53.315 --> 37:55.770
I'll go over as soon as I finish.

37:55.942 --> 37:58.978
- Mind if Peter covers? He's still on.
- Not at all.

37:59.153 --> 38:03.067
- Dr. Corday, we need you!
- I'm leaving. I want this IV out now!

38:03.240 --> 38:08.197
- Please don't. She won't listen.
- You're anorectic. You need to stay.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.948
- That's not what the shrink said.
- We can't force you to stay.

38:11.163 --> 38:15.456
- You could die without treatment.
- Take this damn thing out!

38:16.042 --> 38:17.370
All right.

38:17.543 --> 38:19.561
Remove the IV.

38:19.596 --> 38:21.564
I never said to call my mother.

38:21.599 --> 38:24.334
I'm an adult. I can do what I want.

38:28.260 --> 38:32.339
You're right. Sorry.
I'm only trying to save you.

38:32.555 --> 38:34.847
I don't want your help.

38:36.683 --> 38:39.932
A friend of mine died today
fighting for his life.

38:40.102 --> 38:43.071
You want to leave?
Fine. Kill yourself.

38:43.271 --> 38:47.767
If you don't give a damn, neither do I.
Discharge her.

38:51.778 --> 38:56.238
There. I'm in the RV.
Draw blood from the distal port.

38:57.532 --> 39:00.449
- Blood's bright red.
- He has a hole in his heart.

39:00.660 --> 39:04.075
- Leaking oxygenated blood.
- Pressure's still low.

39:04.288 --> 39:06.197
Start Nipride. Call the O.R.-

39:06.414 --> 39:09.331
I told you to get him
to the cath lab!

39:09.542 --> 39:12.246
- Going to the pulmonary artery.
- We don't do Swans here.

39:12.419 --> 39:15.538
- I told him that.
- He needs an angioplasty.

39:15.713 --> 39:18.630
- He'd have died in the cath lab.
- What?

39:18.841 --> 39:21.082
I sampled blood
from the right ventricle.

39:21.259 --> 39:23.252
Bright red. He perfed his septum.

39:25.304 --> 39:28.305
- What about his Ml?
- They can bypass him...

39:28.473 --> 39:32.173
...when they fix the rupture.
The O.R.'s waiting.

39:32.393 --> 39:36.805
We work together.
Next time tell me what you're doing.

39:39.565 --> 39:43.230
- Can't you give me something?
- Couple more sutures.

39:43.402 --> 39:46.521
- Then you go to jail.
- You're hurting me!

39:46.738 --> 39:48.445
- Sorry.
- He's killing me!

39:48.656 --> 39:53.483
- He needs more lidocaine.
- Why? I did an infraorbital block.

39:53.702 --> 39:56.192
You missed the nerve.
Infiltrate locally.

39:58.580 --> 40:00.738
It'll distort the wound-

40:00.957 --> 40:03.329
Infiltrate subcutaneously
or I'll take over.

40:09.130 --> 40:10.541
Fine.

40:11.507 --> 40:13.250
You do it.

40:19.263 --> 40:22.548
Dr. Chen, we meet in such odd places.
You paged me for a consult?

40:22.766 --> 40:27.676
First, I want you to meet the mother
of the little boy I told you about.

40:27.895 --> 40:31.559
- Hey, I'm very sorry about your son.
- Thank you.

40:31.773 --> 40:35.437
- I said we'd test her baby girl.
- Excellent idea.

40:35.651 --> 40:38.687
I hear that if hospitals screened
every newborn...

40:38.862 --> 40:40.486
...hundreds of lives might be saved.

40:40.655 --> 40:44.522
- Since the test only costs-
- I'm sorry.

40:44.700 --> 40:48.531
- Can you show me where my consult is?
- This isn't a surgical consult.

40:49.203 --> 40:51.030
- It's not?
- No.

40:51.872 --> 40:53.331
I'm sponsoring a petition...

40:53.499 --> 40:57.412
...to offer expanded
newborn genetic testing.

40:57.585 --> 41:00.158
I told Mrs. Lattimer
and she wanted to meet you.

41:00.379 --> 41:04.506
Though Kenny didn't get the test,
some good will come of this.

41:05.716 --> 41:09.500
So if you'd just sign
on the bottom page...

41:12.180 --> 41:17.386
As I tell all my Residents,
what's good for County is good for me.

41:24.106 --> 41:26.063
- Seen Carol?
- Not in a while.

41:26.274 --> 41:29.061
- If you do, tell her I'm looking for her.
- Okay.

41:29.318 --> 41:34.193
- I hear you performed a heroic save.
- Just did what I thought best.

41:34.406 --> 41:37.738
Attendings are here
to supervise Residents.

41:37.950 --> 41:39.741
- Fine.
- It's not fine.

41:39.910 --> 41:43.243
You don't perform dangerous
procedures alone. Is that clear?

41:43.413 --> 41:45.784
Start the second IV en route.
ETA is five minutes.

41:45.998 --> 41:49.366
Copy. See you in five.
I'll set up Trauma One.

41:49.584 --> 41:51.541
Multiple stab wounds coming.

41:51.711 --> 41:53.833
- Interested?
- No, thanks.

41:54.630 --> 41:57.167
- How's that little girl?
- Cuts will heal.

41:57.340 --> 42:00.175
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

42:01.385 --> 42:03.128
There you are.

42:03.303 --> 42:06.921
I was looking for you.
You all right?

42:07.098 --> 42:11.925
- I've been up here thinking.
- Birthdays can make you do that.

42:12.102 --> 42:15.055
It's been quite a year.

42:15.271 --> 42:18.022
Yeah. For me too.

42:18.774 --> 42:21.525
I look forward to the next one.

42:27.155 --> 42:30.109
I'm sorry, I don't think
I can have dinner with you tonight.

42:34.119 --> 42:38.246
- Did I do something wrong?
- No. No, it's not you.

42:40.124 --> 42:41.748
It's me.

42:44.544 --> 42:46.038
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

43:01.474 --> 43:03.217
Mark?

43:04.977 --> 43:06.554
Hi.

43:11.190 --> 43:12.850
I'm so sorry.

43:16.361 --> 43:18.317
Can I help with anything?

43:19.196 --> 43:23.774
Not really.
Called all his Navy pals in San Diego.

43:23.950 --> 43:28.860
I just spoke with Rachel.
I'm filling out some forms.

43:29.871 --> 43:31.698
His taxes.

43:31.956 --> 43:35.787
Mom used to do his taxes,
so they're a mess.

43:36.668 --> 43:41.294
And his house.
I gotta sell the house.

43:42.840 --> 43:47.465
I promised I wouldn't sell the house
when he came here.

43:51.680 --> 43:57.302
But I don't see a reason to keep it.
