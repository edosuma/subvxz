00:09.500 --> 00:11.041
Hey, Teddy bear.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.792
Don't call me that.

00:13.875 --> 00:16.709
- PJ!
- Actually I had a question for you.

00:17.792 --> 00:20.875
For my tuxedo, should I go
with tangerine or powder blue?

00:21.792 --> 00:23.041
PJ!

00:24.583 --> 00:26.417
And the limo was kind of expensive,

00:26.500 --> 00:28.500
so my grandpa is gonna drive us
in his station wagon.

00:30.250 --> 00:31.959
Okay, I'm gonna regret asking this,

00:32.041 --> 00:33.750
but what are you talking about?

00:34.458 --> 00:36.125
Homecoming dance. You're my date.

00:36.792 --> 00:38.875
Again, what are you talking about?

00:40.083 --> 00:41.667
You promised you'd go with me.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.375
Emmett, wake up.

00:46.375 --> 00:48.250
I'm not dreaming, okay?

00:48.375 --> 00:49.709
April 19, 2004,

00:49.792 --> 00:51.333
you agreed to go
to homecoming dance with me.

00:51.417 --> 00:53.709
- I have proof.
- Well, let's see the proof.

00:53.792 --> 00:54.875
Okay.

01:03.625 --> 01:05.834
Hey, Teddy bear.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.500
Don't call me that.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.750
Will you be my girlfriend?

01:11.125 --> 01:12.250
No.

01:13.792 --> 01:15.166
How about now?

01:17.208 --> 01:18.375
No.

01:20.208 --> 01:22.041
Okay, how about this?

01:22.291 --> 01:24.375
If I don't have a girlfriend
in high school,

01:24.500 --> 01:26.583
will you go to the homecoming dance
with me?

01:26.667 --> 01:28.959
If I say yes, will you get out of my face?

01:29.041 --> 01:31.375
- Yes.
- Then yes.

01:31.458 --> 01:33.917
Yes! You got that, PJ?

01:38.667 --> 01:40.250
Emmett, we were just kids.

01:40.375 --> 01:43.000
You're not gonna actually make me go,
are you?

01:43.083 --> 01:44.959
My grandpa doesn't like to drive at night,

01:45.041 --> 01:46.250
so be ready around 4:30.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.208
Ooh, those are never good words.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.917
May I introduce my high school band...

02:58.667 --> 03:01.542
The Bob Duncan experience?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.500
Ha ha. Look at that.

03:05.583 --> 03:07.250
There's Richie. There's Marty.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.917
And check out your old man
in the middle there, huh?

03:11.875 --> 03:13.291
That look familiar?

03:13.709 --> 03:16.333
Um... no.

03:17.917 --> 03:20.250
Oh, come on, PJ, I look just like you.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.875
I don't see it.

03:21.959 --> 03:24.000
We could be twins.

03:24.083 --> 03:25.834
I choose not to see it.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.333
All right. Well, anyway, we made an album.

03:30.375 --> 03:32.000
- Check that out. Pretty rad, huh?
- Yes.

03:32.083 --> 03:34.208
Right, "The Bob Duncan..."

03:34.250 --> 03:36.542
- Both: "Experience."
- No no!

03:36.625 --> 03:39.834
Oh! Aw man! Oh shoot!

03:39.917 --> 03:42.250
Uh, can we, uh,
can we glue it or tape it or--

03:42.333 --> 03:44.917
No no, it's gone.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.375
That-- that wasn't the only one, right?

03:47.458 --> 03:50.417
Yeah. Well, I told you, we made an album.

03:52.083 --> 03:56.083
Dad, I am so sorry.

03:56.166 --> 03:58.083
No, it's all right.

03:58.166 --> 04:01.959
It's my fault for having sweet memories...

04:02.041 --> 04:04.166
And kids.

04:12.583 --> 04:15.709
Okay, pirate Charlie,
let me see your boo-boo.

04:15.792 --> 04:18.458
Amy: Not a good idea to wear
a patch on both eyes.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.959
Hi, guys. How's the lemonade business?

04:24.041 --> 04:26.709
Great, thanks to Leo's
awesome lemonade recipe.

04:26.792 --> 04:28.166
Oh, I can't take all the credit.

04:28.250 --> 04:29.750
It was your idea to steal--

04:29.834 --> 04:33.250
I mean borrow the lemons
from Mrs. Dabney's tree.

04:34.083 --> 04:37.000
Gabe, you stole lemons from Mrs. Dabney?

04:37.083 --> 04:39.125
I hope this doesn't come back
to bite me in the--

04:43.500 --> 04:45.333
Hello, Mrs. Dabney.

04:47.375 --> 04:48.792
Lemons?

04:50.625 --> 04:52.500
I don't know anything about lemons.

04:56.458 --> 04:58.667
- We should do this again tomorrow.
- Definitely.

04:58.750 --> 05:01.250
- Hey, let's divide up the profits.
- Yeah.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.834
Okay, so we made--

05:05.917 --> 05:09.834
looks like forty dollars
and twenty-five cents!

05:09.917 --> 05:11.375
- So here.
- Cool.

05:12.792 --> 05:14.166
Why do you get the quarter?

05:14.250 --> 05:16.083
I thought we were partners.

05:16.542 --> 05:18.125
Fine, we'll split the quarter.

05:22.250 --> 05:23.792
12¢?

05:23.875 --> 05:26.000
Why do you get the extra penny?

05:26.083 --> 05:27.792
Because it was my idea.

05:27.875 --> 05:29.375
I'm the brains of this operation.

05:29.458 --> 05:30.959
Yeah, but I'm the eye candy.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.291
Okay, this is stupid.

05:34.750 --> 05:36.667
The next time we have an extra penny,
you can have it.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.750
- I want this one.
- This one's mine.

05:38.834 --> 05:43.542
- You're being a jerk.
- You're being a... Jerky jerk.

05:44.125 --> 05:46.250
And you call yourself the brains.

05:46.375 --> 05:49.375
You know what? Keep your precious penny.

05:49.458 --> 05:51.000
This partnership is over.

05:51.083 --> 05:53.250
Fine. I don't need you.

05:53.375 --> 05:56.291
I don't need you. I don't need anybody.

06:01.041 --> 06:03.083
I need your mom. She's my ride.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.834
Oh hey, Emmett, Emmett.
Uh, we need to talk.

06:13.917 --> 06:17.083
Sure thing, homecoming date.
She's my homecoming date!

06:19.000 --> 06:20.375
Maybe not.

06:21.625 --> 06:22.959
Here we go. Let's just sit.

06:23.041 --> 06:26.750
So in that video your exact words were

06:26.834 --> 06:29.917
I had to go to homecoming with you
unless you had a girlfriend.

06:30.792 --> 06:33.875
- So?
- So I'm gonna get you one.

06:33.959 --> 06:35.917
Oh, that's funny.

06:37.208 --> 06:38.792
No no, I'm, I'm serious.

06:38.875 --> 06:41.834
There's this new girl in school
and I think she's perfect for you.

06:41.917 --> 06:44.792
- What makes her perfect?
- She doesn't know anything about you.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.041
So her name is Alicia.

06:48.125 --> 06:51.250
She's very sweet. She is very attractive.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.917
So I just have to figure out
a way to make you...

06:54.709 --> 06:56.333
Appealing.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.083
Is it gonna be easy? No.

07:00.583 --> 07:02.083
Is it gonna be doable?

07:02.458 --> 07:03.625
It has to be.

07:08.834 --> 07:11.125
Hey, Dad! Come up here. I got a surprise.

07:12.041 --> 07:14.583
Those are never good words.

07:15.917 --> 07:18.291
- Richie!
- Bobby!

07:18.375 --> 07:21.083
Both: Heh heh hey!

07:21.291 --> 07:23.166
Look at you! You haven't changed at all!

07:23.250 --> 07:25.250
Ha, and you...

07:25.583 --> 07:27.959
Ah, Bobby!

07:29.959 --> 07:32.917
- What-- what are you doing here?
- PJ called me up.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.917
Something about getting
the band back together.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Dad, I felt so bad
about breaking the album,

07:37.083 --> 07:38.834
I thought you guys could make another one.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.500
PJ, this is fantastic.

07:42.583 --> 07:43.959
Hey, did you track down madman Marty?

07:44.041 --> 07:46.875
Yeah yeah. He can't make it, book club.

07:48.166 --> 07:51.458
No, he's still a madman, just with books.

07:52.208 --> 07:55.166
Well, hey, PJ can sit in on guitar.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.250
This is great!

07:57.375 --> 07:59.834
The Bob Duncan experience is back!

08:09.875 --> 08:11.667
How, how long do we do this?

08:13.667 --> 08:16.583
Until the imaginary applause dies down.

08:31.041 --> 08:32.333
Kind of quiet around here.

08:32.917 --> 08:34.250
Want to know why?

08:39.083 --> 08:42.500
"Leo's lemonade lounge"?
You're competing with me?

08:42.583 --> 08:44.750
Competing would imply competition.

08:45.375 --> 08:48.458
And from what I see,
hmph, I don't have any.

08:50.875 --> 08:52.917
The "s" in "Leo's" is backwards.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.208
I did that on purpose. It's cuter.

08:55.458 --> 08:58.208
Is that why you put two Ms in "lemonade"?

08:58.291 --> 08:59.458
I did?

09:01.333 --> 09:03.667
Check your spelling, eye candy.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.667
Forget that.
Wait till you see what else I have.

09:06.750 --> 09:08.792
I'm gonna squeeze you out of business

09:08.875 --> 09:10.417
like you squeeze a lemon.

09:10.750 --> 09:14.250
- You know, because to make lemonade--
- Yeah, I got it.

09:14.333 --> 09:16.208
This isn't over, Leo.

09:16.792 --> 09:19.125
Oh, but I think it is.

09:24.291 --> 09:26.667
He's evil. He's diabolical.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.417
I despise him.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.166
The backwards "s" sure is cute though.

09:40.041 --> 09:41.500
Okay, there she is.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.250
Oh, I don't know about this, Teddy.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.458
- Alicia might be too hot for me.
- Wh--

09:45.542 --> 09:47.542
I'm too hot for you.

09:47.625 --> 09:49.834
Yeah, but I got something on you.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.917
Okay, so here's what you're gonna do.

09:53.625 --> 09:56.417
You walk over to Alicia
and you say, "I'm Emmett.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.417
I've seen you around
and I just wanted to say hi."

09:58.500 --> 10:01.041
- Then what?
- Then you just walk away.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.917
Oh, okay. What kind of walk
are you looking for?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.458
Like a moonwalk or like a robot
or like a shuffle--

10:05.542 --> 10:08.792
Oh, none. None, none of the above.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.625
You just leave. You're creating mystery.

10:12.333 --> 10:14.458
- Oh, one more thing.
- Wait, what are you doing?

10:14.542 --> 10:16.333
I need those and they go with my hat.

10:16.417 --> 10:17.792
Good point.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.792
Okay, go get her, tiger.

10:22.959 --> 10:25.083
Hi, I'm Emmett.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.000
I've seen you around
and I wanted to say hi.

10:28.083 --> 10:29.792
Well, hi.

10:29.875 --> 10:31.750
- Ha.
- Ooh!

10:41.750 --> 10:43.709
Okay. Okay.

10:43.792 --> 10:46.125
- So maybe you do need these.
- Yeah.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.083
All: Yeah!

11:02.166 --> 11:03.834
That was awesome!

11:03.917 --> 11:05.875
Welcome to the experience.

11:05.959 --> 11:07.250
Richie dude, I love that move

11:07.333 --> 11:09.375
where you, like, stood up
in the middle of your drum solo.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.000
My butt fell asleep.

11:12.166 --> 11:14.250
Isn't it great? Hey, you know what?

11:14.375 --> 11:16.792
After we record the album,
we should play some gigs.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.333
Oh, I second that emotion. PJ, are you in?

11:19.417 --> 11:20.959
Hecks to the yeah.

11:21.041 --> 11:22.917
All right, gentlemen,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.750
time to take a break for the sake,
a pause for the cause.

11:25.834 --> 11:27.917
- Same patter.
- Same bladder.

11:29.583 --> 11:31.959
Man, it's awesome to see
my dad so happy again.

11:32.041 --> 11:35.041
Yeah, he enjoys his bathroom.

11:36.333 --> 11:39.000
- I mean the music, man.
- Oh.

11:39.083 --> 11:40.417
Why did you guys ever break up?

11:40.709 --> 11:41.750
Well...

11:42.875 --> 11:45.750
Bobby was dating this chick
who was always hanging around,

11:45.834 --> 11:47.792
trying to weasel her way into the band.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.000
- Oh.
- She drove me and Marty nuts.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.583
- Ugh, sounds like a nightmare.
- She was.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.917
Now what was her name?

11:55.000 --> 11:58.583
- Richie!
- Amy!

11:58.667 --> 12:00.667
It was Amy.

12:12.959 --> 12:16.000
I heard Richie was in the house.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.583
Ooh ooh!

12:18.125 --> 12:20.583
Speaking of house, are you still living
in your parents' basement?

12:21.625 --> 12:22.583
Of course.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.792
You know how hard it is
to move a waterbed?

12:24.875 --> 12:27.417
- Yeah.
- Hey, honey!

12:27.500 --> 12:29.583
Hi, rock star.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.333
You're not gonna believe this.

12:31.458 --> 12:34.125
- We're gonna start playing gigs again.
- That is so rad!

12:35.125 --> 12:37.083
Hey hey hey, play Rocky mountain chick.

12:37.166 --> 12:39.500
- PJ, that's about me.
- Rad!

12:40.041 --> 12:42.250
- Did I use that right?
- Kind of.

12:44.709 --> 12:47.375
Ready? One, two, three, four!

12:51.709 --> 12:56.417
♪ Rocky mountain chick,
You make my body tick ♪

12:56.500 --> 13:00.625

This isn't about making money.

It's about taking you down, my brotha.

Now today we're gonna try

Try whatever you want.
Either way I have a date.

15:58.417 --> 16:00.709
Yeah yeah, why don't you just stand here

16:00.792 --> 16:02.875
and wait until I give you a signal?

16:04.375 --> 16:06.417
Hi, Alicia. I know you're new here.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.083
- I'm Teddy.
- Hi.

16:08.166 --> 16:11.250
So you came here kind of
in an awkward time,

16:11.333 --> 16:13.875
what with homecoming dance
just days away and...

16:13.959 --> 16:15.875
Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.

16:15.959 --> 16:17.709
- Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
- What?

16:17.792 --> 16:20.000
Okay okay, so you see
that really cute guy there?

16:20.083 --> 16:22.750
Where? Behind the guy
with the hat and the glasses?

16:23.208 --> 16:24.917
No no no. No no no.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.375
Under the hat, behind the glasses.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.000
The plate crasher?

16:29.083 --> 16:30.834
His name is Emmett.

16:31.166 --> 16:33.792
Oh, Emmett, even his name is dreamy.

16:34.709 --> 16:38.083
Every girl in school wants to go to
homecoming with him, especially me.

16:38.166 --> 16:40.083
Were you here yesterday?

16:44.583 --> 16:46.041
Oh my gosh, here he comes.

16:46.709 --> 16:48.000
- Hi.
- Hi, Teddy.

16:48.083 --> 16:50.375
Oh, he knows my name!

16:50.458 --> 16:52.709
Hi, Emmett.

16:52.792 --> 16:54.750
So, uh, are you going to the dance?

16:55.500 --> 16:57.959
Actually, that's what I came
to talk to Alicia about.

16:58.041 --> 17:01.834
Oh, Alicia. Of course, the new girl.

17:01.917 --> 17:03.208
You're so lucky.

17:03.458 --> 17:04.875
Oh well.

17:05.667 --> 17:07.792
It hurts, but I'll smile through the pain.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.500
Now I'll leave you two alone to talk about

17:11.583 --> 17:13.875

Yeah yeah, about that,

17:58.333 --> 17:59.583
Sure. What about?

17:59.667 --> 18:01.333
Actually I think
it would be better if you,

18:01.417 --> 18:02.750
if you heard it from Charlie.

18:02.834 --> 18:04.709
Go ahead, Charlie.
Tell mommy what's on your mind.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.917
Mommy...

18:08.041 --> 18:10.000
Okay, she's obviously
too upset to say anything.

18:11.083 --> 18:13.959
No, no, no. You're upset? Why?

18:14.542 --> 18:17.125
Um, she thinks it's a bad idea
for you to be in the band.

18:17.208 --> 18:19.250
- Charlie said that?
- Yes.

18:19.375 --> 18:21.917
- Did you say that, Charlie?
- No, mommy.

18:25.583 --> 18:28.375
Wait, PJ, you don't want me in the band?

18:29.750 --> 18:31.917
But it's so much better with me in it.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.959
Yeah yeah, it is, but the problem is...

18:38.083 --> 18:40.417
- That is the problem.
- What is?

18:40.500 --> 18:42.959
You're good. You're too good.
You're too good.

18:43.041 --> 18:44.959
And we all know you're a star.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.333
But when you're next to dad...

18:46.458 --> 18:49.125
- He fades into the woodwork.
- Ex-- yes!

18:49.208 --> 18:51.458
I mean, come on.
The Bob Duncan experience?

18:51.542 --> 18:54.667
- Hello? The Amy Duncan experience?
- Exactly!

18:54.750 --> 18:56.875
- Oh!
- Exactly.

18:57.250 --> 18:58.959
I can't do that to him.

18:59.917 --> 19:01.458
Can I?

19:01.834 --> 19:03.333
No, no,

19:03.834 --> 19:05.667
because you are too good a person.

19:06.125 --> 19:09.333
- Darn my humanity.
- Yeah yeah.

19:10.375 --> 19:12.250
Okay okay.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.083
Pulled that out.

19:17.959 --> 19:20.875
By the way,
you are terrible under pressure.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.542
Sorry.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.625
Yeah!

19:41.250 --> 19:42.583

you know, I'm putting a
little something together myself.

20:09.667 --> 20:10.709
So we should talk.

20:12.583 --> 20:15.875
All right. Good afternoon, Edward drive!

20:19.041 --> 20:21.500
We are the Bob Duncan experience.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.959

a lesson from Gabe this week.

21:20.208 --> 21:22.250
When life hands you lemons,

21:22.333 --> 21:24.208
you go to homecoming with Emmett.

21:26.959 --> 21:28.291
You know, but the truth is

21:28.375 --> 21:29.875
we're probably gonna have a good time.

21:29.959 --> 21:33.125
- And it's just one dance.
- Until prom.

21:34.375 --> 21:36.917
Wait, what? What do you have on me?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.166
- Oh, not much.
- Oh!

21:40.917 --> 21:43.125
"Teddy says yes to prom."

21:43.208 --> 21:45.250
"Teddy says yes to marriage"?

21:46.959 --> 21:48.792
That one took a bit of editing.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
If he thinks that's gonna happen,

21:52.083 --> 21:54.166
he's gonna need some good luck, Charlie.
