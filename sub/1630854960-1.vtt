[Captain] The cold:
Cutting, stinging.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.877
All common sense
was devastated by

00:43.911 --> 00:46.447
the brisk bitterness
of this place,

00:47.748 --> 00:52.453
as starvation that led to
unendurable pain, endless agony,

00:53.221 --> 00:55.656
hysteria took the helm.

00:55.689 --> 00:58.726
Sailing even my
most rational men

00:58.759 --> 01:01.929
into a dark and cruel unknown,

01:03.297 --> 01:07.768
into this, the frozen
white nightmare

01:08.969 --> 01:11.705
from which none of
them would return.

[exhales loudly] Plenty
to go around, Simmons.

Maybe you'd ration it?

03:29.643 --> 03:31.078
[cup thuds]

03:31.111 --> 03:33.981
Now back to the galley and
clean your pot, you old crab.

03:34.014 --> 03:38.852
[accordion continues
playing upbeat tune]

03:41.655 --> 03:43.056
What are you sketchin'
today, Redgrave?

03:43.090 --> 03:43.891
It's not finished yet.

03:43.924 --> 03:44.758
It don't matter!

03:45.893 --> 03:46.727
Ahh.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.063
Ahh!

03:50.097 --> 03:51.765
-Who's she then?
-No one!

03:51.799 --> 03:54.535
A little fantasy of
yours, eh, Redgrave?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.169
A scally lad like
you wouldn't even

03:56.203 --> 03:58.839
know what to do with
her if you had her.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.441
You know, you keep your
head buried in that journal

04:00.474 --> 04:01.409
you might never
actually experience

04:01.442 --> 04:03.511
any of this expedition
with your own eyes.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.646
This is what we have to
document our journey.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.914
When we're back to
Grindleton Marsh,

04:06.947 --> 04:08.982
I'll be selling
these to the papers,

04:09.016 --> 04:10.718
proof of our great
rescue mission.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.053
Selling them?

04:13.086 --> 04:15.088
The better ones fetch
me a good price.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.891
So while us petty
officers are mopin' about

04:17.925 --> 04:19.360
listening to this racket,

04:19.393 --> 04:21.295
you're earnin' more than any
of us without breakin' a sweat?

04:21.329 --> 04:24.798
Perform every duty asked
of me on the Innsmouth.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.902
Teach me to draw like that.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.938
Can you draw, Marlowe?

04:32.440 --> 04:34.174
I can do anything
better than most men

04:34.207 --> 04:35.576
if I put my head to it.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.579
Come on.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.248
Help me earn some extra
for the family back home.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.117
With time, I'd consider it.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.119
Don't have much of a
family, do you, Redgrave,

04:46.153 --> 04:47.054
from what I hear?

04:47.087 --> 04:48.756
You know nothing about me!

04:48.789 --> 04:51.559
[scoffs] Just being
friendly, lad!

04:52.460 --> 04:53.361
[bottle clanks]

04:53.394 --> 04:55.062
Will you draw me next, Charles?

04:55.095 --> 04:57.798
I want me face on
"The Morning Herald".

04:57.831 --> 04:59.099
Your grubby mug's not worth

04:59.132 --> 05:00.501
printin' on the
"Grindleton Packet",

05:00.534 --> 05:01.869
let alone "The Herald".

05:02.903 --> 05:04.071
That's not what your
wife was tellin' me

05:04.104 --> 05:05.906
the night before we set off.

05:05.939 --> 05:09.477

[accordion plays upbeat tune]

05:23.256 --> 05:26.093
[pot lid clangs]

05:26.126 --> 05:27.961
Don't know how long we can
continue this for, Redgrave.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.430
For goodness sake,

05:29.463 --> 05:31.632
we're stocked to last three
years on this ship, if needs be.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.900
And Captain Mortimer says

05:32.933 --> 05:34.301
that we're headed back
come close of winter.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.169
The Captain's an optimist.

05:36.203 --> 05:39.272
Two winters passed before
we came looking for Ayebaun.

05:39.306 --> 05:42.242
You think men like Marlowe
Spriggs are bastardly now,

05:42.275 --> 05:44.612
you wait to see how they
behave on half rations

05:44.645 --> 05:46.079
when their bellies are achin',

05:46.113 --> 05:48.716
and men like you
become easy targets.

05:49.717 --> 05:50.551
It'll never come to that.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.052
I've seen it, Charles!

05:52.085 --> 05:53.554
Men are like animals.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.989
They'll fight like dogs
over a scrap of salt pork.

05:57.625 --> 05:58.559
Ah, Christ!

06:01.194 --> 06:03.731
If we get caught, it'll be
the cat 'o nine for us both.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.298
If anyone finds out,
I'll take the blame.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.735
You can say I stole
from the galley.

06:07.768 --> 06:08.569
Oh, I will.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.339
I've had some lashings
in my time, never again.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.876
The salt beef, you know
where I keep the tins.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.179

[door handle rattles]

06:35.228 --> 06:36.430
Sir Roland?

06:36.464 --> 06:37.865
Barnabas McCulloch
is here to see you.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.633
He insists it's urgent.

06:39.667 --> 06:40.501
Send him in.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.071
[boat creaking]

06:48.408 --> 06:50.778
-Mortimer.
-Barnabas, old mate.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.212
Have a drink, perhaps?

06:52.245 --> 06:54.648
I'm afraid we have more pressing
matters at hand, Captain.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.817
Best we keep all our
wits about us now.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.185
Gideon?

06:58.218 --> 07:00.954
This is our passage.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.857
The same route mapped by
Captain Streiner on the Ayebaun.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.227
The waters that
we've sailed into

07:07.260 --> 07:09.663
are becoming evermore unsafe.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.264
We're floating off course,

07:11.298 --> 07:12.866
and the ice is growing thicker.

07:12.900 --> 07:16.504
The men have reported seeing
great slabs pass us by.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.740
Barnabas, the Innsmouth
is no ordinary ship.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.809
My father had the
hull plated with iron.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.143
We can cut through these sheets.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.013
Your father is back home
in Grindleton Marsh.

07:26.046 --> 07:29.416
We are in the middle of a half
frozen polar ocean, Gideon.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.818
Further north than any ship

07:30.851 --> 07:33.020
that's safely returned
has ever sailed!

07:33.053 --> 07:34.755
Pardon me, Mr. McCulloch,

07:34.788 --> 07:36.056
we are but days away from

07:36.089 --> 07:38.258
Sir William Streiner's
last known position.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.728
We must be brave.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.195
We will return as heroes

07:42.229 --> 07:44.665
when we find the
Ayebaun and her crew.

07:44.698 --> 07:49.169
Before that, we may be
required to take some risks.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.704
Believe me, Mortimer,

07:50.738 --> 07:54.575
I am as invested as you in
finding your lost friend,

07:54.608 --> 07:58.311
but this, this is old ice.

07:58.345 --> 08:01.214
Navigating a safe passage
is near impossible

08:01.248 --> 08:02.916
now that we've entered
these winter months.

08:02.950 --> 08:03.851
How impossible?

08:03.884 --> 08:05.986
We must set a new course.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.721
Retreat immediately,

08:07.755 --> 08:10.924
or the Innsmouth will
freeze into the ice sheet,

08:10.958 --> 08:13.326
where it will remain
for the rest of winter,

08:13.360 --> 08:17.364
floating further and further
north, until it is too late!

08:17.397 --> 08:19.567
It's a 400 ton ship, Barnabas.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.601
You underestimate her.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.269
I'm not talking to you, Gideon!

08:22.302 --> 08:25.238
-Please, Captain!
-Gideon is right.

08:25.272 --> 08:28.241
We are a war ship, the
Ayebaun was a schooner.

08:28.275 --> 08:31.378
To find Streiner, we must
follow his treacherous path

08:31.411 --> 08:33.146
as far as these waters allow.

08:33.180 --> 08:36.049
The Innsmouth has just
returned from two years service

08:36.083 --> 08:37.685
on the Mediterranean Sea.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.820
This is the unrelenting Arctic!

08:39.853 --> 08:41.288
Lower your voice, Barnabas!

08:42.355 --> 08:44.091
We are listening!

08:44.124 --> 08:46.694
Then hear me when I say,

08:46.727 --> 08:50.731
this place, it doesn't
care about you,

08:50.764 --> 08:53.400
it doesn't care about your
great desires or yearnings,

08:53.433 --> 08:56.570
your dedication to this cause.

08:56.604 --> 08:59.673
It only knows that we
are warm flesh and blood,

09:00.808 --> 09:03.243
and how to freeze the
very life from us.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.348
I will return with
Streiner dead or alive.

09:09.783 --> 09:13.386
That was my promise and
I intend to keep my word.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.287
Hear! Hear!

09:15.789 --> 09:18.158
Alter our course
wherever you see fit,

09:18.191 --> 09:20.027
but we go onwards.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.562
We do not retreat.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.265
Captain.

09:26.099 --> 09:29.269
[footsteps departing]

09:32.773 --> 09:35.876
[door clatters open]

09:37.277 --> 09:38.612
Barnabas, please!

09:41.448 --> 09:42.616
Listen to the Captain.

09:42.650 --> 09:43.951
He's an Arctic veteran.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.185
He'll get us safely home.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.287
Lieutenant, you come
into this position

09:47.320 --> 09:48.756
from a life of privilege.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.158
If you expect to return
safely to that life,

09:51.191 --> 09:53.460
then shut up and listen
to someone who knows

09:53.493 --> 09:54.962
what they're talking about!

09:54.995 --> 09:58.431
Our asshole captain wants
only to find Streiner

09:58.465 --> 10:00.267
and that doomed ship!

10:00.300 --> 10:03.370
I fear he sees the rest
of us as expendable.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.605
He will not give
you a second thought

10:05.639 --> 10:07.174
when you are cold and desperate,

10:07.207 --> 10:09.076
and begging like a
bitch for his help,

10:09.109 --> 10:11.378
if this expedition goes array.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.013
If you don't believe
in our assignment,

10:13.046 --> 10:14.314
then why even come?

10:14.347 --> 10:16.283
I was ordered, Gideon.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.185
Because too few men
on board Innsmouth

10:18.218 --> 10:20.520
know a bloody thing
about polar exploration.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.892
What is it that you so
believe in here, Gideon?

10:24.925 --> 10:27.094
Is it Streiner's recovery,

10:27.127 --> 10:29.096
or do you simply
want to be the first

10:29.129 --> 10:30.764
to make this great voyage

10:30.798 --> 10:33.400
on board your father's
precious vessel?

10:33.433 --> 10:34.267
Enough!

10:36.369 --> 10:39.339
I could make your life
very difficult back home,

10:39.372 --> 10:40.307
if you don't start showing me

10:40.340 --> 10:41.875
some courtesy here, McCulloch.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.013
Convince him to turn us around.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.148
You're as afraid

10:48.181 --> 10:49.082
-as the rest of us.

The dogs are barkin'
at somethin' out there.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.313
Seals?

11:21.381 --> 11:23.450
Our dogs don't bark at seals.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.585
[dogs continue barking
in the distance]

11:25.618 --> 11:26.820
Listen up, chaps.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.056
Captain Mortimer wants
you all out on the ice.

11:29.089 --> 11:32.425
We're gonna cut a channel before
we're completely frozen in.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.927
Up you get.

11:33.961 --> 11:36.029
I want you all gathered on the
main deck in a quarter hour.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.230
Not gonna let a patch of frost

11:37.264 --> 11:39.066
stop the Innsmouth
in her tracks.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.267
Onwards to glory, men.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.236
-Mr. Spriggs?
-Sir?

11:43.270 --> 11:44.738
You and Ashcroft go
down to the cargo hold

11:44.772 --> 11:46.006
to check it for damage.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.440
Right away, Lieutenant.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.142
If you'll pardon me, Lieutenant,

11:49.176 --> 11:51.378
someone should inform Redgrave.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.646
Perhaps he could check the hold?

11:53.680 --> 11:55.749
Indeed, see that he helps.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.484
Would seem the size and
strength of Innsmouth

11:57.517 --> 11:59.386
has worked against us.

11:59.419 --> 12:02.322
Shallow waters, gentlemen,
and poor navigation.

12:02.355 --> 12:05.158
What use is a one ton
steam engine now, eh?

12:05.192 --> 12:07.828
But to sink us to
the frozen depths.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.864
Just a minor worry
of mine, Lieutenant.

12:10.898 --> 12:14.734
[dark ominous music]

12:14.768 --> 12:15.602
Redgrave?

12:17.404 --> 12:18.738
-Redgrave!
-[pounding on door]

12:18.772 --> 12:21.708
-[pounding on door continues]
-Redgrave, open up!

12:21.741 --> 12:24.411
[door clatters]

12:25.545 --> 12:26.980
What in hell's name is this?

12:27.014 --> 12:28.548
Marlowe, please!

12:28.581 --> 12:30.517
You mustn't tell a soul.

12:30.550 --> 12:33.120
What's a woman
doin' on board, eh?

12:33.153 --> 12:34.654
You've been harborin'
a stowaway, Redgrave.

12:34.687 --> 12:38.191
That's a very serious
and punishable offense.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.193
She was in the cargo hold.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.162
It was already too late.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.997
The Captain will
have you flogged.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.499
Both of ya.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.169
That's somethin', I
dare say, I'll enjoy.

12:49.202 --> 12:53.273
Other men's suffering
can be quite entertainin'

12:53.306 --> 12:54.942
with little else to
keep you occupied.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.609
Keep this between us.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.245
For her sake!

12:58.278 --> 13:00.981
She has her reasons for
journeying out here, Marlowe.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.315
Please?

13:02.349 --> 13:05.252
What's in it for me to
keep my lips tight, eh?

13:06.653 --> 13:07.821
Oh, [snaps fingers] oh!

13:10.323 --> 13:12.059
How 'bout them drawings?

13:13.193 --> 13:15.262
Said they'd fetch a
tidy price, did you not?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.396
Those are mine.

13:18.031 --> 13:21.534
If you wanted to buy my
silence, this is a start.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.735
Give those back!

13:22.769 --> 13:23.937
-[Redgrave grunts]
-[dark ominous music]

13:23.971 --> 13:24.838
-[body thuds]
-[Redgrave groans]

13:24.872 --> 13:27.074
-Stop it!
-Ah, it speaks!

13:27.107 --> 13:29.042
I'd keep my pretty,
little voice quiet.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.911
Others might hear you.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.580
Must think you're
real smart, Redgrave.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.382
I never took you for
much of a fanny rat.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.985
Keepin' all that to
yourself, was ya?

13:38.018 --> 13:39.486
Better pray nobody
else finds out.

13:39.519 --> 13:44.357
Could be dangerous havin' a
rat aboard a boatload of men,

13:45.492 --> 13:47.394
all away from home, all
missin' their wives.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.596
Do you know what
I mean, Redgrave?

13:49.629 --> 13:53.733
In a place so
destitute of pleasures,

13:54.935 --> 13:57.604
some might not be able
to control their urges.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.106
You're a bloody pig!

13:59.139 --> 14:00.607
-[blow lands]
-[Redgrave moans painfully]

14:00.640 --> 14:02.242
-[body thuds]
-[Redgrave groans]

14:02.275 --> 14:06.113
[Redgrave continues groaning]

14:07.780 --> 14:09.983
I have a family out here!

14:10.017 --> 14:11.384
Lost in an expedition!

14:11.418 --> 14:13.053
Can't you understand?

14:13.086 --> 14:15.455
Don't you have a
brother or a sister?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.424
This is the Arctic, deary.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.858
No place for you.

14:18.892 --> 14:21.261
It's not like the fanciful
tales you read about back home.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.130
Even men struggle out here.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.265
Now, I'll escort
you to the Captain,

14:25.298 --> 14:27.867
unless we've got a deal,
Little Mr. Redgrave?

14:27.901 --> 14:29.369
Give it back to him.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.870
I go to the Captain myself.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.706
Keep your shit drawings then.

14:33.740 --> 14:34.975
[Redgrave moans painfully]

14:35.008 --> 14:37.244
This'll be worth it just
to see Mortimer's face.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.981
And Redgrave, when
your bollocks have

14:41.014 --> 14:42.282
come back down from your gut,

14:42.315 --> 14:43.917
Ashcroft's waitin'
in the cargo hold.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.818
You're to inspect it for damage.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.120
[Barnabas whispers indistinctly]

14:47.154 --> 14:48.388
Captain?

14:48.421 --> 14:50.257
You'll bloody want to see this.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.358
What now?

14:51.391 --> 14:53.526
[Gideon] Mr.
Spriggs, get in here!

14:53.560 --> 14:58.565
-[footsteps pattering]
-[suspenseful dramatic music]

15:00.533 --> 15:02.002
She's a stowaway,
Captain Mortimer, sir!

15:02.035 --> 15:04.337
I found her hiding
in Redgrave's cabin.

15:04.371 --> 15:07.274
How have we not noticed
a stowaway on board?!

15:07.307 --> 15:09.009
Redgrave kept her secret, sir.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.178
I warned her she'll be flogged,

15:11.211 --> 15:13.413
but she don't seem to
give a monkey's ass.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.381
What's your name?

15:15.848 --> 15:17.384
-Carmen.
-Carmen.

15:18.385 --> 15:19.586
I know not how

15:19.619 --> 15:22.455
or why you find yourself
aboard the Innsmouth,

15:22.489 --> 15:25.392
hundreds of miles north
in these Arctic waters,

15:26.426 --> 15:29.096
but we are ice locked,

15:29.129 --> 15:31.364
which was our greatest fear.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.201
Whatever you hope to
achieve by coming here,

15:34.234 --> 15:37.370
home, warmth, safety,

15:37.404 --> 15:41.308
even the simplest comforts
are far, far from us now.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.776
You must do as us men do,

15:43.810 --> 15:45.678
if you wish to
live through this.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.448
No time for weakness now, lady.

15:48.481 --> 15:52.019
The Arctic has no mercy.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.320
Are you gonna punish her?!

15:53.353 --> 15:55.855
Our situation here
is punishment enough.

15:58.525 --> 16:01.294
[engine chugging]

16:06.933 --> 16:08.035
[Ichthyoid chittering]

16:08.068 --> 16:11.171
[intense suspenseful music]

16:11.204 --> 16:12.039
Ashcroft?

16:14.174 --> 16:19.179
[intense suspenseful
music continues]

16:19.912 --> 16:20.680
[Ichthyoid chittering]

16:36.929 --> 16:38.831
[Redgrave screams
in the distance]

16:38.865 --> 16:40.533
Ashcroft's in the cargo hold.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.468
Stay here!

16:41.501 --> 16:42.402
Keep watch on her!

16:42.435 --> 16:43.703
Quickly, men!

16:43.736 --> 16:46.906
[footsteps departing]

16:48.941 --> 16:51.678
[Redgrave yells frighteningly]

16:51.711 --> 16:53.080
[pants heavily] Fuck!

16:53.113 --> 16:54.781
[Redgrave painfully screams]

16:54.814 --> 16:55.782
Christ!

16:55.815 --> 16:57.084
Get him to the infirmary!

16:58.485 --> 17:00.353
-Where's Ashcroft?
-Dead!

17:00.387 --> 17:01.521
He's dead!

17:01.554 --> 17:03.090
-[Redgrave moans painfully]
-Dead?

17:03.123 --> 17:05.058
There's something in
the cargo hold, Captain.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.526
Some beast.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.129
-Some creature.
-Barnabas, the infirmary!

17:10.530 --> 17:13.966
[Redgrave groans loudly]

17:15.535 --> 17:17.604
-[cooking tools clattering]
-[Ichthyoid chittering]

17:17.637 --> 17:18.471
Hello?

17:20.407 --> 17:22.742
[pot lid clanks]

17:22.775 --> 17:24.077
Marlowe, that you?

17:24.111 --> 17:27.614
[eerie suspenseful music]

17:30.450 --> 17:31.284
Greedy hog!

17:33.086 --> 17:35.755
[object clatters]

17:35.788 --> 17:36.756
Who's in here?

17:36.789 --> 17:37.724
[Ichthyoid chittering]

17:37.757 --> 17:38.991
Redgrave, is that you?

17:39.025 --> 17:42.162
[Ichthyoid continues chittering]

17:42.195 --> 17:43.530
[objects clattering]

18:01.781 --> 18:02.949
[skin squelching]

18:02.982 --> 18:07.053
[Redgrave yells out painfully]

18:07.086 --> 18:08.688
That's a monstrous talon.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.059
There's somethin' in the
cargo hold all right.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.427
Somethin' deadly.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.062
How could we possibly
have sailed this long

18:16.095 --> 18:18.831
with something of that
size in the hold unnoticed?

18:18.865 --> 18:20.567
[Spriggs] Well, it don't
belong to Whiskers the cat.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.469
We failed to notice
a stowaway onboard.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.003
There could be anything
down there now!

18:24.036 --> 18:25.905
Something has found
its way inside!

18:27.540 --> 18:28.941
[breathes shakily] I saw it.

18:30.710 --> 18:31.878
A creature.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.380
I can't explain it.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.648
It's amphibious and man-like.

18:35.682 --> 18:36.783
What have you given
him, McCulloch?

18:36.816 --> 18:37.884
He's gone bloody doolally.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.586
No, no, no, please!

18:39.619 --> 18:41.654
[breathes shakily]
It walked like us.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.891
It had the face and
features of some fish.

18:44.924 --> 18:49.095
Fins, and gills,
and webbed hands,

18:50.363 --> 18:52.699
and rugged, horrid
cracked teeth,

18:52.732 --> 18:54.434
-and-
-Calm yourself, lad.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.868
[Redgrave grunts]

18:55.902 --> 19:00.173
This creature, could you
draw it, Mr, Redgrave?

19:00.207 --> 19:02.175
Maybe we should let
him rest, Captain?

19:05.077 --> 19:06.613
Draw exactly what you saw.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.480
That's an order.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.352
[Redgrave breathes shakily]

19:12.385 --> 19:15.555
[intense eerie music]

19:18.925 --> 19:23.496
[Redgrave continues
breathing shakily]

19:24.364 --> 19:25.765
[Carmen] What's happening?

19:25.798 --> 19:26.999
[footsteps pattering]

19:27.033 --> 19:29.602
-[door clatters open]

-Why?
-[door slams shut]

19:31.170 --> 19:32.138
-[tapping on door]

Where are you going?

-[Carmen whispers indistinctly]

19:36.476 --> 19:40.247
[eerie ominous music]

19:40.280 --> 19:42.114
This is some diluted fantasy.

19:42.148 --> 19:43.816
I'll not believe it!

19:46.686 --> 19:50.690
[eerie ominous music continues]

19:56.028 --> 20:00.032
[eerie ominous music continues]

20:03.836 --> 20:05.272
Stay with Redgrave.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.139
The men await me
on the main deck.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.709
Marlowe?

20:09.742 --> 20:12.144
I want everyone on board armed.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.914
Take this and fill
it with every musket

20:14.947 --> 20:15.982
and shotgun we have.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.953
Aye, Captain.

20:20.987 --> 20:24.557

-[Ichthyoid growls]

20:45.678 --> 20:49.849
[intense dramatic
music continues]

20:49.882 --> 20:52.151
[Captain] Spriggs, grab
everything you can.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.353
We're going on to the ice.

20:53.386 --> 20:54.354
[Spriggs] Outside?

20:54.387 --> 20:55.755
We must get off this ship!

20:57.424 --> 20:59.592
Another creature is in,
kill the damn thing.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.895
[Spriggs] Aye, Captain!

21:02.929 --> 21:05.298
[intense dramatic
music continues]

[door lock rattling]

[crew members
yelling indistinctly]

[boat thuds]

[suspenseful dramatic music]

-[Captain grunts]
-[Gideon groans]

21:32.058 --> 21:33.460
Where is she?

21:33.493 --> 21:34.794
You were watching
over the stowaway.

21:34.827 --> 21:35.995
She's on the ship!

21:36.028 --> 21:37.129
You wanted her to stay put.

21:37.163 --> 21:39.031
Oh, damn you, Gideon!

21:39.065 --> 21:41.167
[both men groaning]

21:41.200 --> 21:42.935
-[Gideon groans painfully]
-For God's sake!

21:42.969 --> 21:44.170
We stay together!

21:44.203 --> 21:45.972
You'll die out there alone!

21:46.005 --> 21:47.974
They're coming for us!

21:49.876 --> 21:51.344
[men panting heavily]

21:51.378 --> 21:55.415
Sir Roland, it's every
man for himself in there!

21:56.983 --> 21:59.952
Anyone left is
surely dead by now!

-[skin squelching]

22:33.486 --> 22:36.589
In here!

22:36.623 --> 22:37.424
What's happening?

22:37.457 --> 22:38.257
Where is everybody?

22:38.290 --> 22:39.091
Everyone's dead.

22:39.125 --> 22:39.926
We have to go now.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.327
How did you get that?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.529
[Carmen] Need powder.

22:42.562 --> 22:43.396
Help me.

22:44.431 --> 22:45.965
[objects shuffling]

22:45.998 --> 22:47.400
What's this?

22:47.434 --> 22:49.502
Go!

22:49.536 --> 22:50.937
Brace yourself.

22:52.138 --> 22:56.042
[groans painfully] Jesus!

22:56.075 --> 22:56.876
Now we walk.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.144
No, no, no, wait!

22:58.177 --> 23:00.780
[Redgrave yells out painfully]

23:47.660 --> 23:49.095
-[snow crunching]
-[wind whipping]

23:49.128 --> 23:52.565
I can feel my eyeballs
freezing in their sockets.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.401
Just don't take your
dick out for a piss

23:55.434 --> 23:57.103
-or you'll freeze the tip off.
-[Gideon scoffs]

23:57.136 --> 23:58.771
And there'll be
very little left.

24:00.006 --> 24:03.242
[Spriggs pants heavily]

24:04.977 --> 24:09.716
Captain, there's nothing out
there but ice and misery!

24:09.749 --> 24:11.217
Keep moving, Marlowe.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.652
Don't give up.

24:12.685 --> 24:13.486
Give up what, Captain?

24:13.520 --> 24:14.654
All is lost!

24:14.687 --> 24:16.055
[Barnabas] Ahh,
you're still thinking

24:16.088 --> 24:18.190
about Streiner, aren't you?!

24:18.224 --> 24:19.391
[Barnabas grunts]

24:19.425 --> 24:20.993
But he's out there,
and they could help us.

24:21.027 --> 24:23.295
Oh, for god's sake,
Roland! [pants heavily]

24:23.329 --> 24:26.298
They may be our best
chance of survival now.

24:26.332 --> 24:29.135
You just can't give
it up, can you?!

24:29.168 --> 24:30.269
Why?!

24:30.302 --> 24:32.238
All our men are dead!

24:32.271 --> 24:35.708
No doubt we'll either
starve or freeze out here.

24:35.742 --> 24:40.747
How are you still so hell bent
on trying to find them now?!

24:41.948 --> 24:44.584
Streiner was my brother
and partner for decades.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.218
We traveled the world together.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.020
-He's like a brother to me!
-[Barnabas scoffs]

24:48.054 --> 24:51.891
And yet, he came to cross
the North Pole without you?

24:51.924 --> 24:54.193
We came to rescue the man,

24:54.226 --> 24:55.828
not end up stranded like him!

24:55.862 --> 24:57.396
Or are we just [Barnabas
yells indistinctly]?

24:57.429 --> 24:59.498
-[Captain yells angrily]
-[body thuds]

24:59.532 --> 25:03.002
If they're out there, they
could save us, you moron!

25:03.035 --> 25:06.305
Streiner had the Ayebaun
built wide and shallow.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.440
She was to freeze into the ice

25:08.474 --> 25:11.878
and drift with the
currents over the Pole.

25:11.911 --> 25:14.113
In theory, or it could
be sunk years ago.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.047
Roland!

25:15.081 --> 25:17.684
The Ayebaun could be anywhere!

25:17.717 --> 25:19.652
We'll never find it!

25:19.686 --> 25:20.853
[Barnabas groans]

25:20.887 --> 25:21.921
Yeah.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.723
[Spriggs mutters indistinctly]

25:23.756 --> 25:25.925
[Barnabas and Spriggs groaning]

25:25.958 --> 25:29.128
-I'm fine.
-So what?

25:29.161 --> 25:32.965
Should we just lie down
here in the cold and die?

25:34.233 --> 25:38.237
I'll search for Streiner
until my dying breath.

25:39.572 --> 25:43.910
-[Barnabas pants heavily]
-[Captain grunts]

25:54.587 --> 25:57.323
-[snow crunching]
-Men?

25:58.891 --> 25:59.726
Captain!

26:01.427 --> 26:04.196
It's Redgrave, sir,
and the stowaway.

26:05.164 --> 26:08.100
[snow crunching]

26:08.134 --> 26:09.836
-[Redgrave moans painfully]
-Redgrave.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.470
[Redgrave continues moaning]

26:11.503 --> 26:14.040
-You're alive!
-[Redgrave mutters]

26:14.073 --> 26:15.942
Any other survivors?

26:15.975 --> 26:17.944
Not that we could see, Captain.

26:17.977 --> 26:20.046
I thought we were the
only ones out here.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.581
You left us to die.

26:25.451 --> 26:26.585
She came back for me.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.823
I owe her my life.
[breathes shakily]

26:30.857 --> 26:32.258
Can you go on, man?

26:32.291 --> 26:34.326
He can make it with some help.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.998
[Captain] Barnabas,
Gideon, lend him a hand.

26:39.031 --> 26:41.768

26:45.037 --> 26:47.807

26:52.578 --> 26:53.646
[Barnabas] Now, lift!

26:53.680 --> 26:55.648
[Redgrave yells out painfully]

26:55.682 --> 26:57.549
You're all right, lad.

26:57.583 --> 27:01.453
[all three grunting
and panting heavily]

27:01.487 --> 27:04.056
We have a long walk ahead.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.693

[dramatic instrumental

27:35.521 --> 27:36.756
Captain!

27:36.789 --> 27:40.159
In the mountains,
there's an opening.

27:40.192 --> 27:41.327
How far?

27:41.360 --> 27:44.163
Probably not even half a mile.

27:44.196 --> 27:46.733
[Captain] Half a mile,
and there may be shelter.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.868
I don't know, Captain.

27:48.901 --> 27:51.603
I can't feel this leg anymore.

27:51.637 --> 27:54.006
If you can't feel it, then
it shouldn't be as painful.

27:54.040 --> 27:54.841
We can't stay out here.

27:54.874 --> 27:56.475
It's too dangerous.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.643
I know we're almost there,

27:57.676 --> 27:58.878
and I know the
Ayebaun is out there.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.947
I know you can make it!

28:02.381 --> 28:04.150
Marlowe, give 'em a hand.

28:06.853 --> 28:07.754
Why can't the woman do it?

28:07.787 --> 28:08.587
She dragged him out here.

28:08.620 --> 28:09.621
She's done enough!

28:11.257 --> 28:12.091
Fine.

28:13.392 --> 28:14.626
Come on.

28:14.660 --> 28:15.561

28:37.616 --> 28:39.819
[Gideon] There could
be anything in there.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.854
But it's free of wind and snow,

28:41.888 --> 28:43.856
I'm willing to take my chances.

28:45.057 --> 28:48.727
[ethereal orchestral music]

28:53.465 --> 28:55.534
[Captain] Well, we
can't stay out here.

Okay.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.308
Well, it looks like
we wasn't the first

30:09.341 --> 30:10.910
to find this place.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.480
One of Streiner's men.

30:15.747 --> 30:18.450
Oh, that's just perfect!

30:18.484 --> 30:20.686
We can all guess
what killed him.

30:20.719 --> 30:21.921
He's been shot.

Gideon!

31:01.961 --> 31:06.966
-You!
-[gun thuds]

31:08.334 --> 31:11.237
Have you used a gun before?

31:11.270 --> 31:12.771
I'll manage.

31:12.804 --> 31:14.273
Two of us should go on ahead,

31:14.306 --> 31:16.675
make sure it's safe before
we venture much deeper.

31:17.709 --> 31:18.544
Lieutenant!

31:19.645 --> 31:20.479
I come.

31:23.049 --> 31:25.851
Best not to argue with her.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.186
Wait here.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.029
Oh, god, you knew him.

[Gideon] What's going on?

32:51.837 --> 32:53.339
I told you to stay put!

32:53.372 --> 32:54.973
[Barnabas] We heard screaming!

32:55.007 --> 32:56.908
It's nothing.

32:56.942 --> 32:59.611
These mountains seem
empty, for now, at least.

33:00.446 --> 33:01.613
Only the dead rest here.

33:04.550 --> 33:07.053
Ah, that's bloody repugnant!

33:08.087 --> 33:08.920
That's revoltin'.

33:08.954 --> 33:10.289
Marlowe, that's enough.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.124
We all cover him up.

33:12.158 --> 33:15.027
Don't you touch him!
Don't you dare!

33:16.495 --> 33:17.496
Leave her.
Come on.

33:17.529 --> 33:18.697
Let her be.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.233
[Gideon] I warned you the
Arctic was no place for a woman.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.035
Go on ahead,

33:23.069 --> 33:25.171
and find somewhere
close for us to settle.

33:27.706 --> 33:28.540
This way.

34:15.854 --> 34:16.755
[Barnabas] We have
enough supplies

34:16.788 --> 34:18.990
to last us a week at most.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.528
Are you worried, McCulloch?

34:23.862 --> 34:26.965
[Barnabas] Someone will
eventually have to journey back.

34:26.998 --> 34:29.468
If there's any
supplies on the ship,

34:29.501 --> 34:30.669
we're going to need it.

34:31.837 --> 34:33.405
And if Innsmouth has
been crushed and sunk,

34:33.439 --> 34:34.773
it'll be a waisted trip.

34:38.710 --> 34:41.347
We have a month, at best,

34:41.380 --> 34:44.816
before starvation takes
hold of all of us.

34:44.850 --> 34:48.520
There's enough food on board
Innsmouth to last us years.

34:48.554 --> 34:52.558
In that time, a rescue
party will find us.

34:52.591 --> 34:53.425
Years.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.227
How many years?

34:57.062 --> 34:59.465
Hopefully, not too
many, Redgrave.

35:00.566 --> 35:02.134
And what if nobody's
coming for us?

35:04.170 --> 35:07.673

35:25.157 --> 35:27.393
[Redgrave grunts painfully]

35:27.426 --> 35:31.062
Charles, let's take a
look at that leg of yours.

35:36.168 --> 35:37.636
[Redgrave groans painfully]

35:37.669 --> 35:42.674
-[skin squelching]
-[Redgrave stammers]

35:47.779 --> 35:48.947
It's warm now.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.382
Warm you say?

35:50.416 --> 35:51.883
I don't think it's too bad.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.621
We should all check our feet.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.823
Don't want to find
our toes turned black.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.458
Black?

35:59.491 --> 36:01.092
Frostbite, Gideon.

36:01.126 --> 36:02.160
[Barnabas] Can you feel this?

36:02.194 --> 36:04.396
[skin squelching]

36:04.430 --> 36:05.264
No.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.201
-This?
-[skin squelching]

36:09.235 --> 36:10.068
No, sir.

36:15.140 --> 36:17.175
[pin clatters]

36:17.209 --> 36:20.712
[eerie suspenseful music]

36:22.981 --> 36:23.815
This?

36:26.184 --> 36:29.721
[eerie suspenseful
music continues]

36:29.755 --> 36:30.589
No, sir.

36:33.259 --> 36:34.693
[skin squelching]

36:34.726 --> 36:36.728
Am I going to be well
enough to walk again, sir?

36:38.597 --> 36:41.833
Just rest up, Mr. Redgrave.

36:44.470 --> 36:48.139
[Redgrave groans painfully]

36:52.244 --> 36:54.746
Surely the best option's
just chop it off?

36:54.780 --> 36:56.214
Or else the infection
will spread.

36:56.248 --> 37:00.319
Gideon, we will not be
amputating any limbs here.

37:00.352 --> 37:02.421
We don't have the
necessary medical supplies

37:02.454 --> 37:03.689
to do so safely!

37:03.722 --> 37:05.090
[Gideon] Then he's
certain to die!

37:05.123 --> 37:07.793
[Barnabas] Keep your
bloody voice down!

37:07.826 --> 37:10.429
Every day he's alive he'll be
eating through our rations,

37:10.462 --> 37:12.464
scoffing what few
supplies we have left.

37:13.665 --> 37:15.534
We're already facing starvation.

37:15.567 --> 37:16.868
Starvation we could alleviate,

37:16.902 --> 37:19.237
if we just look at the
situation rationally.

37:20.171 --> 37:21.640
He's a burden on us.

37:21.673 --> 37:24.943
Gideon, it isn't just
your life at stake here!

37:24.976 --> 37:27.313
You don't have any
exclusive entitlements

37:27.346 --> 37:28.847
out here in the wilderness.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.584
Rank, especially when it's
as ill-deserved as yours,

37:32.618 --> 37:33.785
doesn't matter here!

37:33.819 --> 37:37.756
We all need to help
each other now,

37:37.789 --> 37:39.925
as Captain Mortimer insisted!

37:39.958 --> 37:41.960
You said, "Every
man for himself".

37:41.993 --> 37:43.094
Those were your words.

37:43.128 --> 37:46.164
I was scared and irrational.

37:47.499 --> 37:50.101
For god's sake,
Gideon, be a man!

37:51.837 --> 37:52.671
Where are you going?

37:54.640 --> 37:56.508
If you don't mind, Redgrave,

37:56.542 --> 37:59.411
I'm off to take a shit. Or
would you rather I do it here

37:59.445 --> 38:01.046
so you can absorb the odors?

38:03.515 --> 38:06.618
So my poppet princess over
there can watch over you now.

38:06.652 --> 38:10.322

39:02.408 --> 39:03.809
[Spriggs] Oh!

39:03.842 --> 39:08.847
Oh, Spriggs, you
bute, you. [grunting]

39:11.349 --> 39:12.984
[footsteps pattering]

39:13.018 --> 39:13.852
William?

39:18.089 --> 39:20.258
[gun clanks]

39:20.291 --> 39:21.126
William?

39:24.362 --> 39:29.367
[mellow instrumental music

39:56.194 --> 39:57.429
William?

39:57.463 --> 40:00.966
[shushing] They like
it, the Ichthyoids.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.835
They enjoy our music,
can you believe?

40:04.770 --> 40:05.704
You're alive!

40:07.305 --> 40:09.174
It's a gramophone,

40:09.207 --> 40:11.242
a gift from the Lady Charlotte.

40:11.276 --> 40:13.745
One of the few things I
salvaged from the wreck.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.515
Come in where I
can see you, man.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.286
In the name of Dagan!

40:22.120 --> 40:24.355
Roland Mortimer!

40:24.389 --> 40:27.926
The only man I knew
I could depend on.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.461
You finally came!

40:29.495 --> 40:31.162
You're alone, William?

40:31.196 --> 40:32.197
Are there others?

40:32.230 --> 40:34.766
All dead, dear friend.

40:34.800 --> 40:39.304
But I'm far from
alone. [chuckles evily]

40:40.672 --> 40:43.141
You found the book, I presume?

40:43.174 --> 40:45.076
It led you to these mountains.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.145
That rotten, old
thing you left behind?

40:47.178 --> 40:50.616
You had time to study
its pages, as I did.

40:50.649 --> 40:52.818
It's just gibberish, William.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.285
Old gibberish.

40:54.319 --> 40:58.824
[laughs] Mortimer, you
were also so simple-minded!

41:00.058 --> 41:02.994
You could never match
my accomplishments.

41:03.028 --> 41:05.263
You've seen the Ichthyoids.

41:05.296 --> 41:09.034
-The what?
-The Ich-thy-oids!

41:09.067 --> 41:10.769
Creatures from the ice.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.303
They annihilated my crew.

41:12.337 --> 41:14.606
So you know that they are real.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.775
The pages of the
book speak true.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.510
You came here for
the North Pole,

41:18.544 --> 41:19.978
not because of some book.

41:20.011 --> 41:21.079
You want to be the first!

41:21.112 --> 41:22.147
You're obsessed!

41:22.180 --> 41:24.783
The Pole was never the prize!

41:24.816 --> 41:26.818
It was always them!

41:26.852 --> 41:28.453
The deep ones!

41:28.486 --> 41:32.591
They are exactly as
they are depicted,

41:32.624 --> 41:34.092
only more exquisite!

41:36.461 --> 41:38.764
Don't you see, Roland?

41:38.797 --> 41:43.735
Land, water, this freezing ice,

41:43.769 --> 41:46.638
they can endure it all!

41:46.672 --> 41:49.608
You speak of them as if
they're intelligent beings.

41:49.641 --> 41:51.610
Yes, yes!

41:51.643 --> 41:54.646
They're intelligence
is staggering.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.582
They are superior,

41:56.615 --> 41:59.450
and we are their servants.

41:59.484 --> 42:02.187
Come, sit with
me, and celebrate!

42:02.220 --> 42:03.689
Two years isolation

42:03.722 --> 42:07.325
and the gloom has clouded
your thoughts, William.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.427
You have lost your own purpose!

42:09.460 --> 42:12.964
Mortimer, the government
was never going to

42:12.998 --> 42:18.003
fund an expedition based on
some obscure Arabic book.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.606
I had to mount an expedition

42:20.639 --> 42:22.473
on the pretense
of being the first

42:22.507 --> 42:25.577
to reach the
geographical North Pole.

42:25.611 --> 42:28.079
I lied to you, Mortimer.

42:28.113 --> 42:33.118
The very notion of us conquering
the universe in lunacy.

42:34.185 --> 42:37.589
[scoffs] Exploring every corner,

42:37.623 --> 42:39.124
as if we were the first.

42:39.157 --> 42:42.393
If not for the Pole,
then what was your plan?

42:42.427 --> 42:44.963
What delusions has a book
seeded in your brain?!

42:44.996 --> 42:49.534
Why, return with my
Ichthyoids, of course!

42:49.567 --> 42:50.802
You can't be serious?

42:50.836 --> 42:51.970
They'd wreak havoc on land!

42:52.003 --> 42:52.804
There'd be war!

42:52.838 --> 42:54.606
Yes, yes!

42:54.640 --> 42:59.144
And we would be on
their side, you and I!

42:59.177 --> 43:01.212
You would let loose the
most hideous creatures

43:01.246 --> 43:03.081
I've ever laid eyes
on in our home?

43:03.114 --> 43:04.282
I'll not allow it!

43:04.315 --> 43:06.217
[scoffs] Too late, Roland!

43:06.251 --> 43:07.252
You came!

43:07.285 --> 43:09.988
You are the rescue party.

43:10.021 --> 43:13.158
The bridge between
the ancient beings

43:13.191 --> 43:17.128
and all of pitiful mankind!

43:17.162 --> 43:20.331
I'd rather die than take
over plague of death!

43:20.365 --> 43:21.933
Don't be foolish.

43:21.967 --> 43:23.769
You're insane, William.

43:23.802 --> 43:26.104
No, not insane!

43:26.137 --> 43:29.374
But I have had two years
to think it through,

43:29.407 --> 43:32.043
to comprehend the master plan.

43:32.077 --> 43:34.012
You've had two minutes, Roland!

43:34.045 --> 43:38.216
Your puny human mind
can't comprehend it now,

43:38.249 --> 43:39.084
but it will.

43:40.518 --> 43:44.956
And then, it will all make
perfect, glorious sense.

43:45.556 --> 43:47.125
I came for you!

43:47.158 --> 43:48.293
I kept my promise!

43:48.326 --> 43:50.929
I risked my life, my crew!

43:50.962 --> 43:52.964
Men died at the
quest to find you!

43:52.998 --> 43:56.534
And now you speak of mankind
as if they're expendable?!

43:56.567 --> 43:57.969
Have you no care, sir?!

43:58.003 --> 44:01.606
Dear God care when
he flooded the earth?

44:01.639 --> 44:03.809
Did he care when he
sent a pestilence

44:03.842 --> 44:05.744
to kill thousands in Israel?

44:05.777 --> 44:07.078
You're psychotic!

44:07.112 --> 44:10.982
No, I am more than human.

44:11.016 --> 44:13.551
I have knowledge, Roland.

44:13.584 --> 44:15.754
I have seen what our future is.

44:17.088 --> 44:20.692
If you want to live,
you'll come to your senses!

44:20.726 --> 44:21.993
You need me, Roland.

44:22.961 --> 44:24.429
You need me!

You're better than that.

49:13.451 --> 49:14.552
We can't go home.

49:14.585 --> 49:15.853
We mustn't go home.

49:15.886 --> 49:17.488
[Barnabas] But they'll
send a rescue party.

49:17.522 --> 49:20.091
No, they can't see
what we found here.

49:21.592 --> 49:24.562
Others will come, men like
Streiner, men like me!

49:25.630 --> 49:27.832
There was no
expedition to the Pole.

49:27.865 --> 49:29.200
He only came for them.

49:30.568 --> 49:33.671
Captain Streiner, he's alive?

49:33.704 --> 49:36.174
No, something resembling him

49:36.207 --> 49:37.675
and his worst qualities.

49:38.943 --> 49:40.145
[exhales loudly]
Rescuing him now

49:40.178 --> 49:42.280
is the last thing on
earth you want to do.

49:43.648 --> 49:46.084
The Innsmouth must be destroyed.

49:46.117 --> 49:47.585
We cannot let them leave!

49:47.618 --> 49:50.288
But they'll send a rescue ship!

49:50.321 --> 49:52.890
Well, I pray they
don't make it this far.

-[snow crunching]
-[wind whipping]

49:59.630 --> 50:00.731
Captain?

50:01.999 --> 50:04.202
That's a huge sacrifice.

50:05.103 --> 50:06.604
Not just for you,

50:07.872 --> 50:09.807
but for all of us.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.309
[Captain] I know.

50:11.342 --> 50:14.145
I'm sorry, but it must be done.

50:16.281 --> 50:18.383
If you're certain, Roland...

50:18.416 --> 50:20.485
If you're sure this
is the thing to do?

50:20.518 --> 50:21.919
Who knows.

50:21.952 --> 50:23.821
Are those creatures real?

50:23.854 --> 50:26.023
Were all men truly slaughtered?

50:26.057 --> 50:27.725
It was real, Captain?

50:27.758 --> 50:29.427
That's our worst nightmares.

50:29.460 --> 50:31.896
Then Streiner must be killed

50:31.929 --> 50:34.199
before this progresses
any further.

50:35.133 --> 50:36.367
But Captain,

50:36.401 --> 50:37.768
-you know that's-
-I know, I know!

50:37.802 --> 50:39.270
But it's my duty!

50:42.507 --> 50:44.275
And the Innsmouth?

50:44.309 --> 50:45.743
Do we leave her to the ice?

50:47.378 --> 50:49.580
We don't risk her making
it through winter.

50:50.648 --> 50:52.517
There are explosives on board.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.788
Leave it to me.

50:59.657 --> 51:03.161
What in god's name will
you tell the rest of them?!

51:04.595 --> 51:05.763
Leave them their hope

51:07.365 --> 51:09.100
just a little longer.

51:33.958 --> 51:35.526
Why do I have to go?

51:35.560 --> 51:37.195
Why can't the Captain
take care of it?

51:37.228 --> 51:38.629
Because you're Lieutenant.

51:38.663 --> 51:39.964
It's what you signed up for!

51:39.997 --> 51:41.332
It's your duty!

51:41.366 --> 51:42.600
Take her with you.

51:42.633 --> 51:43.968
She's not scared
of those things.

51:44.001 --> 51:45.903
She's staying to
watch over Redgrave,

51:45.936 --> 51:47.738
and fight them off
if they come back.

51:47.772 --> 51:49.474
-Well, I can do that.
-[Barnabas laughs]

51:49.507 --> 51:52.042
You don't give a
damn about Redgrave.

51:52.076 --> 51:54.145
And when it comes
to those creatures,

51:54.179 --> 51:55.413
you're bloody useless.

51:55.446 --> 51:57.182
Oh, please, just
give me a chance?

51:57.215 --> 52:00.818
Gideon, without the supply
run, we won't last a week.

52:00.851 --> 52:02.653
You'll be safe with Barnabas.

52:02.687 --> 52:04.088
I'll be praying
that you're all here

52:04.121 --> 52:05.690
and alive when we return.

52:05.723 --> 52:08.293
It's only a matter of time
before they come back to feed.

52:09.294 --> 52:10.661
-Good luck.
-[pats shoulder]

[footsteps departing]

52:17.067 --> 52:18.636
Captain?

52:18.669 --> 52:21.772
Wouldn't it be better if
we went back to the ship?

52:21.806 --> 52:24.975
[footsteps pattering]

52:29.113 --> 52:30.281
You'd never make it.

52:31.449 --> 52:33.618
No one should have to
stay because of me.

52:33.651 --> 52:34.819
It's only a matter of time

52:34.852 --> 52:37.355
before the ice crushes the ship.

52:37.388 --> 52:39.557
This is our base now.

52:39.590 --> 52:40.891
I'll not leave you behind.

52:40.925 --> 52:42.427
Then what's our plan?

52:42.460 --> 52:44.495
We can't just sit
and wait for them

52:44.529 --> 52:46.130
to pick us off one by one.

52:46.163 --> 52:47.232
Why wait?

52:50.501 --> 52:52.136
Why not fight?

52:52.169 --> 52:54.405
Lay every last one
of them to waste.

52:54.439 --> 52:56.006
There could be hundreds
of them out there.

52:56.040 --> 52:58.042
Good, more for me to kill!

52:58.075 --> 53:00.077
We've already lost Spriggs.

53:00.110 --> 53:01.512
We need to be careful!

53:01.546 --> 53:02.947
Look after our wounded!

53:02.980 --> 53:04.715
I'm not his nurse.

53:04.749 --> 53:06.951
I'm not here to mother anyone.

53:06.984 --> 53:08.319
I'm here to survive,

53:08.353 --> 53:09.587
to fight for my life!

53:12.657 --> 53:14.892
You've underestimated
me, Captain,

53:14.925 --> 53:17.328
and I overestimated you.

53:17.362 --> 53:20.798
From here on, I
do things my way.

53:20.831 --> 53:21.766
No more hiding.

53:24.835 --> 53:25.970
[snow crunching]

53:26.003 --> 53:27.137
[Gideon] We could man the
ship ourselves, couldn't we,

53:27.171 --> 53:28.273
and go for help?

53:29.206 --> 53:30.207
[Barnabas] We're
not leaving them

53:30.241 --> 53:31.909
in the mountains, Gideon.

53:31.942 --> 53:34.345
[Gideon] We'd return
and save them later.

53:34.379 --> 53:36.113
[Barnabas] They only have
a week's supply of food,

53:36.146 --> 53:37.382
for Christ's sake!

53:37.415 --> 53:38.383
[Gideon] Just feels wrong

53:38.416 --> 53:40.785
going back there
to those things.

53:40.818 --> 53:43.554
[Barnabas] We don't
have a choice, Gideon!

53:43.588 --> 53:44.755
[Gideon] We don't
have to listen to

53:44.789 --> 53:46.457
everything Captain
Mortimer says.

53:46.491 --> 53:49.327
Following him has done
none of us any favors.

53:49.360 --> 53:50.995
[Barnabas] As long
as we are out here

53:51.028 --> 53:53.664
he is still our captain.

53:53.698 --> 53:55.700
Once fear and hunger take hold,

53:55.733 --> 53:58.403
we will struggle to
behave rationally.

53:58.436 --> 54:01.606
Let's just follow
orders and stay alive.

[Streiner] Mortimer,

54:44.749 --> 54:47.518
you've come to your
senses, I presume?

54:49.119 --> 54:51.956
You'll join me in
my insurrection

54:51.989 --> 54:54.892
of the ancient ones.

54:54.925 --> 54:56.160
Step into the light,

54:56.193 --> 54:58.028
so we can negotiate.

54:59.397 --> 55:02.633
There's no point to playing
these games, William!

55:02.667 --> 55:05.135
I've sent my men to
destroy the Innsmouth!

55:05.169 --> 55:06.471
You've no way home!

55:06.504 --> 55:07.405
[Streiner] Liar!

55:08.606 --> 55:10.541
I followed your lead,

55:10.575 --> 55:12.710
walked in your shadow,

55:12.743 --> 55:14.512
but this madness,
I cannot permit it!

55:14.545 --> 55:17.882
[Streiner] Madness?
[laughs maniacally]

55:17.915 --> 55:20.585
If you think you can stop them,

55:20.618 --> 55:22.987
you're the one
who's mad, Mortimer.

55:23.020 --> 55:24.822
But why help them, damn you?!

55:24.855 --> 55:27.024
[Streiner] They came
to me in dreams,

55:28.426 --> 55:32.897
chose me to awaken them from
their deep and endless slumber.

55:33.764 --> 55:37.802
Flesh and blood, Mortimer,

55:37.835 --> 55:40.438
the key to their rebirth.

servitude or die!

as they have embraced mine.

When I arrived, they
walked on all fours,

57:20.471 --> 57:22.139
but they developed.

57:22.172 --> 57:26.043
Soon, they were walking
upright, like us,

57:26.076 --> 57:28.613
faster, more agile.

57:28.646 --> 57:31.782
Is that not brilliant?!

57:31.816 --> 57:33.518
And they're my discovery.

57:34.485 --> 57:37.688
My gift to the world!

57:56.941 --> 58:00.678
[Streiner laughs maniacally]

58:00.711 --> 58:01.979
Go on.

58:02.012 --> 58:03.514
Do it.

58:03.548 --> 58:05.349
Kill your old friend.

58:06.517 --> 58:07.451
You can't, can you?

58:09.587 --> 58:13.457
Can't pull the trigger
on another man.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.593
You're not man anymore.

She's still standing.

58:28.806 --> 58:29.774
Thank god!

58:31.341 --> 58:33.911
What if those things
are still on there?

58:36.080 --> 58:39.049
No time for your cowardness now.

-[both panting heavily]

58:58.135 --> 59:00.037
Let's make this quick.

59:00.070 --> 59:00.971
All right. [pants heavily]

59:01.005 --> 59:02.506
You head to the galley.

59:03.608 --> 59:04.609
On my own?

59:04.642 --> 59:06.510
Oh, for god's sake, yes, Gideon!

59:06.543 --> 59:08.078
Stop talking to me like that!

59:08.112 --> 59:09.013
I'm scared!

59:09.046 --> 59:10.314
Keep your bloody voice down.

59:10.347 --> 59:12.316
We don't have time for this!

59:12.349 --> 59:15.953
[both men panting heavily]

59:16.921 --> 59:18.222
[Gideon] Where are you going?

59:18.255 --> 59:21.425
[Barnabas] I have
to find something.

-[Gideon pants heavily]

1:01:09.299 --> 1:01:11.435
What are you doing?

1:01:11.468 --> 1:01:14.571
The Captain has instructed
us to blow up the ship.

1:01:15.740 --> 1:01:17.041
Blow up the ship?!

1:01:17.074 --> 1:01:19.777
It's too much to explain now,

1:01:19.810 --> 1:01:21.611
but we must follow his orders.

1:01:21.645 --> 1:01:22.679
Trust me!

1:01:22.713 --> 1:01:25.682
Barnabas, this is my ship.

1:01:25.716 --> 1:01:27.785
It's our only way out of here.

1:01:27.818 --> 1:01:28.618
Our only way home.

1:01:28.652 --> 1:01:30.287
We can't go home.

1:01:30.320 --> 1:01:32.622
Not with those creatures
potentially aboard.

1:01:32.656 --> 1:01:33.924
Think, Gideon!

1:01:33.958 --> 1:01:35.893
We must sink it.

1:01:35.926 --> 1:01:38.228
We can't wait two more
years for a rescue party

1:01:38.262 --> 1:01:41.098
-to come for us!
-Get your hands off me!

1:01:41.131 --> 1:01:42.299
We'll be dead by then!

1:01:42.332 --> 1:01:44.168
We're all gonna
die anyway, Gideon!

1:01:45.402 --> 1:01:48.773
I tried to warn you
about our situation.

1:01:48.806 --> 1:01:51.308
I didn't wanna get us into this!

1:01:51.341 --> 1:01:52.576
But people like you

1:01:52.609 --> 1:01:54.945
and Mortimer had to
have things your way.

1:01:54.979 --> 1:01:55.913
Well, damn you!

1:01:55.946 --> 1:01:57.614
Now we all must pay the price!

1:01:59.449 --> 1:02:01.919
I have accepted my fate.

1:02:03.353 --> 1:02:07.257
So for once in your bloody
life, stop being so gutless.

1:05:22.953 --> 1:05:25.355
[blow lands]

1:05:31.261 --> 1:05:34.798
You didn't tell me
you'd brought a female.

1:05:34.831 --> 1:05:36.266
How did this happen?

1:05:36.300 --> 1:05:37.767
She was a stowaway.

1:05:37.801 --> 1:05:40.704
Oh, [chuckles] magnificent!

1:05:40.737 --> 1:05:42.906
They've never seen a female.

1:05:42.939 --> 1:05:45.509
This will be a first for them.

1:05:45.542 --> 1:05:47.777
[Streiner laughs maniacally]

1:05:47.811 --> 1:05:51.815
Just think what they can
learn from her anatomy.

1:05:53.317 --> 1:05:56.620
Think of what they
can do to use her.

1:05:58.288 --> 1:06:00.657
[Streiner laughs maniacally]

1:06:00.690 --> 1:06:03.860
Streiner, Captain
of the Ayebaun.

1:06:03.893 --> 1:06:05.329
Well, what's left of him anyway.

1:06:05.362 --> 1:06:09.699
It's been many years since
I set eyes on a woman.

1:06:10.700 --> 1:06:13.037
If my hands weren't tied,

1:06:13.070 --> 1:06:16.940
I would be inside
you in a heartbeat.

-[Streiner laughs maniacally]
-[blow lands]

1:06:23.813 --> 1:06:25.315

Benito?

1:06:29.419 --> 1:06:30.720
Benito?

1:06:30.754 --> 1:06:31.988
Yes!

1:06:32.022 --> 1:06:33.923
Yes, yes, I remember.

1:06:36.126 --> 1:06:36.993
A weakling.

1:06:37.961 --> 1:06:41.831
[chuckles] Blew his brains out.

1:06:41.865 --> 1:06:43.500
Such a waste.

1:06:43.533 --> 1:06:46.636
It's not what I brought
him out here for.

1:06:46.670 --> 1:06:48.738
You led those men
out here to die!

1:06:48.772 --> 1:06:52.076
Sacrificial lambs, Mortimer!

1:06:52.109 --> 1:06:55.712
I came here with a
cargo of living flesh.

1:06:55.745 --> 1:06:58.248
Their deaths are insignificant

1:06:58.282 --> 1:07:01.085
in the wake of my discoveries.

1:07:01.118 --> 1:07:02.352
He was my family.

1:07:02.386 --> 1:07:03.820
[Streiner chuckles]

1:07:03.853 --> 1:07:06.256
How many of them you
bring here to die?

1:07:06.290 --> 1:07:08.225
How many of them you
take from their families?

1:07:08.258 --> 1:07:11.027
Oh, does it matter?!

1:07:11.061 --> 1:07:16.066
Human life is so short
and utterly pointless.

1:07:17.534 --> 1:07:20.237
Tell her, Roland.

1:07:20.270 --> 1:07:22.672
The Ichthyoids live for eons.

1:07:24.074 --> 1:07:28.078
Not when I shoot them in
the head! [breathes shakily]

1:07:28.112 --> 1:07:30.147
This is who we came here for?

1:07:30.180 --> 1:07:32.082
The great captain
of the North Pole?

1:07:32.982 --> 1:07:33.817
He lied,

1:07:35.785 --> 1:07:38.021
but at least we have him now.

1:07:38.054 --> 1:07:39.623
[Gideon] Captain?

1:07:39.656 --> 1:07:41.024

-Gideon.

1:07:42.058 --> 1:07:44.361
[Captain pants heavily]

-[Captain groans softly]
-[Gideon pants heavily]

1:07:56.773 --> 1:07:58.242
They attacked us!

1:07:58.275 --> 1:07:59.609
They came out of nowhere.

1:07:59.643 --> 1:08:01.445
[stammers] What happened?

1:08:01.478 --> 1:08:03.713
They killed Barnabas.

1:08:03.747 --> 1:08:05.249
I couldn't fight them.

1:08:05.282 --> 1:08:07.117
All right, all right.

1:08:07.151 --> 1:08:10.019
The Innsmouth, is she
destroyed, Gideon?

1:08:11.555 --> 1:08:14.191
We sunk it [pants
heavily] with dynamite.

1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:17.561
Good, good.

1:08:17.594 --> 1:08:19.129
At least he didn't die in vain.

1:08:20.730 --> 1:08:23.833
I'm sorry I couldn't bring
any supplies, captain.

1:08:23.867 --> 1:08:28.104
[pants heavily] I had
to get out of there.

1:08:28.138 --> 1:08:28.972
Captain?

1:08:31.007 --> 1:08:32.676
What is it, Captain?

1:08:33.977 --> 1:08:34.811
Nothing.

1:08:36.746 --> 1:08:37.581
Go on.

You're Sir Henry Roth's son.

1:09:58.828 --> 1:10:00.330
-Gideon?
-Yeah.

1:10:01.465 --> 1:10:02.699
You're Captain Streiner.

1:10:03.867 --> 1:10:04.701
They found you.

1:10:05.702 --> 1:10:07.871
Captured me, actually.

1:10:07.904 --> 1:10:09.306
I thought Mortimer
was your friend?

1:10:09.339 --> 1:10:10.840
So did I, my boy.

1:10:11.941 --> 1:10:15.011
But the cold does
things to a man's mind.

1:10:15.044 --> 1:10:17.714
Gives him strange inclinations.

1:10:17.747 --> 1:10:19.483
Nobody's thinking
rationally anymore.

1:10:19.516 --> 1:10:20.517
Exactly!

1:10:21.785 --> 1:10:25.188
Mortimer was devastated
I'd got this far.

1:10:25.221 --> 1:10:28.024
He wants the glory for himself.

1:10:28.057 --> 1:10:31.227
They tried to blow up my
father's ship, HMS Innsmouth.

1:10:31.261 --> 1:10:33.297
So, did they?!

1:10:34.230 --> 1:10:35.131
I stopped them.

1:10:35.164 --> 1:10:38.868
[Streiner laughs maniacally]

1:10:39.769 --> 1:10:40.837
Oh, clever.

1:10:42.672 --> 1:10:45.609
You really are Sir Henry's son.

1:10:47.010 --> 1:10:50.380
I had much admiration
for your father.

1:10:50.414 --> 1:10:52.682
If I'd been captain
of Innsmouth,

1:10:52.716 --> 1:10:55.118
I would've had you
back before winter.

1:10:56.520 --> 1:10:59.389
I could've saved you
this suffering, Mr. Roth.

1:10:59.423 --> 1:11:01.658
I just wanna get
back to England.

1:11:01.691 --> 1:11:03.393
I can get you home.

1:11:03.427 --> 1:11:06.563
Indeed, we'd have to
wait until the ice melts,

1:11:06.596 --> 1:11:10.334
but I could captain
Innsmouth back to land.

1:11:10.367 --> 1:11:13.703
Years I've waited
for you to find me.

1:11:14.871 --> 1:11:19.543
Years I've suffered in
this freezing darkness.

1:11:19.576 --> 1:11:24.581
These mountains can
be cruel, Mr. Roth.

1:11:25.449 --> 1:11:26.850
You escaped the creatures?

1:11:26.883 --> 1:11:27.717
Dogs.

1:11:28.818 --> 1:11:30.954
Nothing more than dogs

1:11:30.987 --> 1:11:33.623
that can be taught to
respect their masters

1:11:33.657 --> 1:11:36.092
with a few simple tricks.

1:11:36.125 --> 1:11:38.562
Your crew, I've seen the bodies.

1:11:38.595 --> 1:11:41.831
They had small minds.

1:11:41.865 --> 1:11:46.870
They lost themselves in
these mountains of madness.

1:11:48.938 --> 1:11:52.208
But you're smarter than them.

1:11:52.241 --> 1:11:55.345
You see this retched
body of mine?

1:11:55.379 --> 1:11:57.914
Is that what you want to become?

1:11:57.947 --> 1:11:59.716
-No.
-Then free me.

1:12:01.418 --> 1:12:06.022
Free me, and together,
we'll escape this place.

Boundless, but free of men.

1:25:55.884 --> 1:25:57.920
The Arctic wants to kill us,

1:25:59.555 --> 1:26:03.226
