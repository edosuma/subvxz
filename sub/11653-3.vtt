AKU: Long ago, in a distant land,

00:04.672 --> 00:09.385
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.469 --> 00:12.931
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.139 --> 00:18.603
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword

00:18.686 --> 00:21.606
stepped forth to oppose me.

(SWORDS CLANGING)

00:24.484 --> 00:29.364
Before the final blow was struck,
I tore open a portal in time

00:29.447 --> 00:33.952
and flung him into the future,
where my evil is law.

00:34.369 --> 00:38.206
Now the fool seeks to return to the past

00:38.540 --> 00:43.002
and undo the future that is Aku.

You, my friend, are a living fossil.

01:43.688 --> 01:46.441
The spell Aku cast must have
ripped me from my own time

01:46.608 --> 01:48.401
and flung me into the distant future.

01:48.484 --> 01:49.527
We need you.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.279
With your tremendous skill.
