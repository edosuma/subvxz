00:19.520 --> 00:20.938
<i>Mitsuki.</i>

00:22.523 --> 00:23.732
<i>Mitsuki.</i>

00:32.448 --> 00:34.117
<i>I know you're feeling tired.</i>

00:43.293 --> 00:44.711
<i>Losing time?</i>

00:47.256 --> 00:48.423
Memories?

00:57.891 --> 01:02.187
No. You're not here. I need to work.

01:03.272 --> 01:08.235
Mitsuki, you need to tell me
if you're experiencing symptoms.

01:09.278 --> 01:13.574
Not here... you're not here...

01:18.120 --> 01:19.580
Touch my hand.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.185
Not here...

01:41.185 --> 01:45.856
you're not here...

01:46.356 --> 01:49.359
I need to find the pattern...

01:49.359 --> 01:50.277
Stop!

01:52.571 --> 01:54.239
You need to rest.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.074
You need to let your mind heal.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.703
I'll be here, Mitsuki.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.554
- You're here.
- I'm here.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.767
Touch. The perfect bypass.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.895
Circumvents the signal to the brain.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.732
I'm here.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.862
You've been losing time.

02:37.699 --> 02:38.700
Hearing things?

02:41.954 --> 02:42.955
It will pass.

02:44.373 --> 02:48.168
I'll stay here with you
while you learn the alien's language.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.420
The others... the other scientists.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.673
You're not there yet. I promise.

02:57.094 --> 03:00.514
I have to-- The frequencies.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.850
I'm missing something.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.353
Okay. Tell me about it.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.437
I need more data.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.440
There's a dozen frequencies.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.694
I'm close. I just can't see the pattern.

03:13.694 --> 03:17.114
If I can decipher it,
we can understand them.

03:30.752 --> 03:31.837
You tried to warn me.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.590
I won't let what happened to the others
happen to you.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.216
I promise.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.387
In a few hours when your head clears,
we'll check your baselines.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.932
I know how valuable
learning their language would be,

03:43.932 --> 03:45.601
but you have to take a break.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.812
I'm missing something.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.105
Mitsuki?

03:51.023 --> 03:52.524
I'm missing something.

03:52.524 --> 03:57.154
I know it's in here. I just can't hear it.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.865
Listen to me. First, you lose time.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.659
Then you lose connection
with the outside world.

04:03.285 --> 04:06.788
Then you lose communication.
That's what happened with the others.

04:06.788 --> 04:07.873
The others?

04:08.540 --> 04:10.792
You need to stop. Rest.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.628
The others.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.505
You're not there yet, I promise.

04:14.505 --> 04:15.797
- I told you--
- That's it.

04:17.466 --> 04:18.884
- That's it.
- What is?

04:31.897 --> 04:33.941
Mitsuki? What are you doing?

04:35.025 --> 04:36.151
Quiet.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.195
I need quiet.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.279
Quiet!

04:40.989 --> 04:41.990
Turn that off.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.722
What's happening?

05:05.722 --> 05:07.140
I don't know.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.065
You were wrong.

05:57.608 --> 05:58.609
About what?

05:59.193 --> 06:01.111
They didn't lose communication.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.823
They're just not communicating
in our language.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.702
They are communicating like them...

06:11.079 --> 06:12.164
The aliens.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.687
What the hell?

08:15.162 --> 08:17.122
Code red. Code red. We have a breach!

08:17.706 --> 08:20.959
All available personnel.
Check the north quadrant.

08:20.959 --> 08:24.838
Get your goddamn hands up!
Move away from the hatch!

08:24.838 --> 08:27.508
On the ground, now! I said, on the ground!

08:27.508 --> 08:29.092
We will shoot you!

08:30.385 --> 08:33.347
- Last warning.
- No! No!

08:34.972 --> 08:36.933
- What are you hiding down there?
- Just shut up!

08:36.933 --> 08:39.144
- What are you hiding?
- Lock the damn hatch!

08:39.144 --> 08:42.105
- Let's go, let's go!
- Check the floor!

08:43.440 --> 08:46.360
- Secure the perimeter!
- Go, go, go!

08:46.360 --> 08:47.611
See anything?

08:51.448 --> 08:52.574
Trev.

09:01.375 --> 09:04.086
Bro, it's a bloody fortress.
Are you sure they're in there?

09:04.670 --> 09:05.671
I can hear them.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.299
We'll look for a way in.
Just you and me, Alf.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.593
If they see us, we're lost children.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.012
I could be a lost child.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.014
I'm smaller.

09:16.765 --> 09:17.766
And cuter.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.644
She does add authenticity.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.691
Okay, fine.

09:26.400 --> 09:31.196
But Penny? Hey, Penny,
you're gonna listen to Jamila, all right?

09:32.030 --> 09:33.198
I'll look after Caspar.

09:33.907 --> 09:34.908
Thanks.

09:37.619 --> 09:38.829
Alf.

09:53.719 --> 09:54.845
Jesus. What?

09:56.054 --> 09:57.639
You don't trust me.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.433
Oh, yeah? What gave you that idea?

09:59.933 --> 10:00.934
It's all right.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.897
I don't really know if I trust myself.

10:04.897 --> 10:08.066
I mean, I hear things.
I see things I don't really understand.

10:10.903 --> 10:13.572
Well, no worries. I've got my eye on you.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.867
Good.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.206
Hey, look.
You've been gone for a long time.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.292
I mean, shit,
people have been gone for a long time,

10:25.292 --> 10:27.377
you know,
sometimes they come back different.

10:27.878 --> 10:30.756
You know, they've got
a whole other family or whatever.

10:30.756 --> 10:32.090
Or little voices in their heads.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.969
But do you think maybe you're different?

10:36.595 --> 10:38.096
Maybe you're not you?

10:40.098 --> 10:41.767
Then who else would I be?

10:44.061 --> 10:45.062
Them.

10:47.523 --> 10:49.233
I would never hurt Jamila.

10:49.733 --> 10:51.109
Oh, I know that, mate.

10:51.944 --> 10:53.362
'Cause I'll make sure of it.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.620
Looks like we've got more in common
than you thought.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.503
I don't need superpowers to see it.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.131
I think she's probably the only one
that doesn't see it.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.216
See what?

11:14.883 --> 11:17.094
Nothing. Nothing at all.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.513
Fine. Keep your secrets.

11:20.138 --> 11:23.225
While you boys were busy gabbing,
I figured a way in.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.697
What's she doing in here?

11:37.281 --> 11:40.784
We're recording ticks. Binary code
built the Internet, ones and zeros.

11:41.702 --> 11:43.704
If she's recovered,
I want her back in the enclosure.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.455
She's not cleared yet.

11:45.455 --> 11:48.834
The worst of her symptoms have receded,
but her readings are still erratic.

11:48.834 --> 11:49.918
I don't care.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.088
Transmit these to my lab.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.090
I'll reassemble there.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.807
What's she gonna learn
from these burnouts, huh?

12:03.807 --> 12:05.392
Fear? Failure?

12:06.727 --> 12:09.438
I want her back inside,
and I'm losing patience.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.690
You mean the WDC is losing patience.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.192
I mean the world is.

12:14.026 --> 12:15.319
How many more need to die

12:15.319 --> 12:19.489
so you can play fucking Mother Teresa
to a room full of crackpots

12:19.489 --> 12:22.451
- who've outlived their purpose.
- You mean your purpose?

12:23.035 --> 12:25.704
I mean the goddamn world's purpose, Maya!

12:25.704 --> 12:28.707
You say this is all personal for me
like that's a bad thing.

12:28.707 --> 12:32.836
I don't mind your judgment.
Your high-and-mighty morality.

12:32.836 --> 12:35.172
- I'm used to it. It's how I survived.
- If you don't care,

12:35.172 --> 12:37.633
then why are you wasting your time
saying all of this to me?

12:37.633 --> 12:40.302
Because I'm not the one who changed.
You are.

12:41.386 --> 12:44.306
This girl, she means more to you,
doesn't she?

12:44.306 --> 12:46.850
Maybe I should put you
in that room of yours, huh?

12:46.850 --> 12:50.979
Ask you some questions. Poke around
in your head for a bit, Doctor.

12:52.022 --> 12:55.484
Or we can both serve our purpose.

12:55.484 --> 12:58.445
And by "our" I mean
the whole fucking human race.

12:59.738 --> 13:02.115
I'm not going to talk to her
until she's ready.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.492
Fine.

13:05.327 --> 13:06.703
I will.

13:14.628 --> 13:15.963
You scared it.

13:16.880 --> 13:20.300
The alien.
That's why it came at you so hard.

13:20.300 --> 13:24.555
You got too close.
Too close to whatever it was hiding.

13:24.555 --> 13:27.975
We-- You have the advantage now.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.770
I'm starting to learn
its language structure. Its syntax.

13:31.770 --> 13:35.023
Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe you're the one who's scared.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.527
Is that what it is?

13:38.527 --> 13:41.530
It's not the alien
that got inside your head, it's Maya.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.658
The others.
You're scared you'll end up like them.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.911
So, you're doing exactly
what that entity wants you to do.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.289
You're hiding.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.004
If I can learn its language,

13:57.004 --> 13:59.631
I can hack its internal communication
pathways. I can--

13:59.631 --> 14:01.717
You can do what? What then?

14:01.717 --> 14:04.469
What if it doesn't feel like talking?

14:04.469 --> 14:08.098
What if it lies to you? Manipulates you?
How will you know?

14:08.098 --> 14:10.767
We're not trying to figure out
how to make friends with this thing.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.270
We're here to destroy it. Destroy them.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.856
Do I need to remind you, of all people,
about that?

14:17.107 --> 14:18.275
They killed your lover.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.111
They killed your family.

14:21.111 --> 14:24.114
They're in the process
of killing everyone else you know.

14:25.741 --> 14:30.037
When you got here, Maya said you were
operating from a place of guilt and anger.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.331
She was worried
that wasn't a good motivator.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.249
But you know what?

14:34.249 --> 14:37.753
Those are the best motivators
if you wanna win a fight.

14:38.629 --> 14:39.671
Win a war.

14:40.464 --> 14:44.718
So you can stay in here
and operate through fear...

14:45.385 --> 14:48.055
or you can suit up and fight back.

14:48.555 --> 14:52.684
It's hiding something.
Get in there and find out what.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.892
What the hell are you doing
with those people?

15:37.396 --> 15:39.481
What are you guys hiding in there, huh?

15:47.614 --> 15:51.285
What's your purpose in Idabel?

15:51.285 --> 15:53.954
- How did you know to look in the crater?
- You're kidding me.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.831
We're gonna have to elevate
the level of discourse.

15:55.831 --> 15:59.084
There's a giant hole
with security three layers deep.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.128
I don't know where the fuck
you think I was gonna look.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.754
We know all about you.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.757
Sure. That's why we're having
this conversation, right?

16:06.550 --> 16:08.468
You've been on the outside a while.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.013
Quit the service
right when we needed you most.

16:11.763 --> 16:16.143
Biggest attack world's ever known.
"Family reasons."

16:16.143 --> 16:18.562
You know we had
the exact same training, right?

16:19.938 --> 16:22.733
Your wife says you're depressed. Manic.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.652
Don't talk about my wife.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.071
Delusions of saving the world.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.201
Must be rough, huh?

16:33.410 --> 16:34.536
Punching the clock.

16:34.536 --> 16:37.414
Following that playbook,
hoping to God it'll make a difference.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.166
But y'all gotta look outside

16:39.166 --> 16:41.502
because the rules of engagement
have changed up.

16:46.173 --> 16:50.469
But you just keep pushing.
Pushing that pencil.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.101
Daddy's calling.

17:10.239 --> 17:11.490
Chief Cole.

17:12.657 --> 17:13.700
I'm General Mitchell.

17:14.785 --> 17:15.786
General.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.829
Apologies for your treatment.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.583
What we're dealing with here
is highly classified, and you're right,

17:21.583 --> 17:23.544
far from the usual playbook.

17:23.544 --> 17:25.253
There's no protocol for any of this.

17:25.253 --> 17:27.923
So I'm gonna need to ask you
some questions.

17:27.923 --> 17:30.759
For your safety. For ours. For everyone's.

17:30.759 --> 17:33.512
And maybe, together,
we can make a little progress.

17:33.512 --> 17:34.763
What led you here?

17:34.763 --> 17:38.600
Kid's drawing in a notebook.
It's in that file. Look it up. Okay?

17:38.600 --> 17:41.687
I got debriefed when I came stateside,
I'll tell you everything you need to know,

17:41.687 --> 17:44.481
but I need to know some things in return.
Got it?

17:44.481 --> 17:47.943
What are you guys hiding in that pit,
and what did you do with those people?

17:48.527 --> 17:52.698
We didn't "do" anything to them.
We're examining them.

17:52.698 --> 17:55.117
They were taken by the aliens.

17:55.117 --> 17:59.162
So if they were taken by aliens,
how did you get them back?

17:59.162 --> 18:00.998
That's classified.

18:00.998 --> 18:02.958
- "Classified."
- Who knows you're here?

18:02.958 --> 18:04.168
- No one.
- No one?

18:05.210 --> 18:07.087
No one on the outside
waiting to hear from you?

18:07.087 --> 18:09.965
I can make sure they're not harmed,
but only if I have all the facts.

18:09.965 --> 18:13.010
I'm alone. This town has been
as hospitable as you all are.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.469
How did you get them back, General?

18:15.429 --> 18:16.430
Okay.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.850
Well, we're gonna need to keep you here.

18:19.850 --> 18:23.645
Security reasons.
I really wish you hadn't come.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.106
It's a bad time
to be away from your loved ones.

18:27.983 --> 18:30.277
Instead of locking me up,
why don't you use me, okay?

18:30.277 --> 18:32.196
Use me. I have more experience
than any of your men,

18:32.196 --> 18:34.281
and I've fought these things before.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.866
Bring me in, General.

18:35.866 --> 18:37.117
Nice meeting you, Chief Cole.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.243
General, read me in.

18:38.243 --> 18:40.078
General. General!

18:40.662 --> 18:41.663
Fuck!

18:46.293 --> 18:47.294
Fuck!

18:53.717 --> 18:54.718
This way.

19:19.576 --> 19:20.786
Soldiers.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.457
I think they're leaving, though.

19:33.674 --> 19:36.134
Casp. Can you hear them?

19:37.845 --> 19:38.846
The voices.

20:19.845 --> 20:24.683
It's him! It's him! From the dream!

20:32.858 --> 20:35.652
Esmee, what's happening?

20:50.459 --> 20:52.961
He's the boy in the dream!

20:52.961 --> 20:56.423
No! No! No! Stop! Stop!
They're with us! They're with us.

20:59.801 --> 21:03.847
Caspar? Caspar Morrow?

21:08.310 --> 21:09.561
How are you alive?

21:12.606 --> 21:13.607
I don't know.

21:22.866 --> 21:25.452
Maya! So shocked to see you.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.662
You can't send her in.

21:34.044 --> 21:37.923
It's of endless fascination to me
that a person with such compassion,

21:37.923 --> 21:41.009
such empathy for the whole world,

21:41.009 --> 21:44.263
repeatedly chooses the one over the many.

21:45.347 --> 21:48.725
It's called basic humanity,
and I thought that's why I was here.

21:48.725 --> 21:54.106
No. No. I brought you here
to map an alien's consciousness.

21:54.857 --> 21:58.402
Just think about that, eh?
An alien's consciousness.

21:59.820 --> 22:02.489
Neurobiologists would kill
for this opportunity,

22:02.489 --> 22:07.661
so imagine my disappointment to find
you're better suited to play nursemaid.

22:08.453 --> 22:10.247
- What a waste.
- That won't work on me.

22:10.247 --> 22:12.249
Here we go. What won't?

22:12.249 --> 22:17.087
Foster insecurity. Seed guilt.
Offer the one and only solution.

22:17.087 --> 22:19.339
Close the deal
before they have time to think.

22:20.674 --> 22:24.219
- You're predictable.
- I'm effective, unlike you.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.054
Just for a moment,
let go of your ego, and listen.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.639
Whoa, that's a tall order.

22:27.639 --> 22:30.767
You asked me to map a hive consciousness.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.728
That's exactly what I'm doing.

22:32.728 --> 22:34.855
You asked me to supervise anyone going in

22:34.855 --> 22:37.816
to make sure we maintain
the strategic advantage.

22:37.816 --> 22:39.610
That's exactly what I'm doing.

22:41.361 --> 22:45.490
If you push Mitsuki in now, you will cede
that advantage, and we will lose.

22:47.242 --> 22:49.077
That is my professional opinion.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.207
Ignore it,
and I'll resign my position right now.

22:54.833 --> 22:55.834
Really?

22:57.544 --> 22:58.670
Would you do that?

23:02.633 --> 23:06.970
Resignation accepted. Eh, thank you
for your time with the Amazon Project.

23:06.970 --> 23:09.431
I wish you all the best
in the outside world--

23:09.431 --> 23:10.849
Or whatever's left of it.

23:12.684 --> 23:16.188
Watch your back. I hear there's aliens.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.902
I'll take my chances
with the monsters outside.

23:40.754 --> 23:42.089
What are you doing here?

23:42.840 --> 23:46.260
I'm leaving. I came to say goodbye.

23:48.345 --> 23:50.305
You said you would be here for me.

23:50.305 --> 23:53.016
And I want to be. More than anything.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.020
But I can't. Not anymore.

23:57.020 --> 24:00.440
- I have to fix what I broke.
- You broke nothing.

24:01.275 --> 24:04.236
You gave us
two of our biggest victories in this war.

24:06.655 --> 24:08.198
You don't have to do this.

24:09.157 --> 24:10.158
Your mind...

24:11.451 --> 24:13.829
your heart, that's what we need.

24:14.705 --> 24:19.251
You go in there like this,
you may never get them back.

24:20.752 --> 24:21.753
You're right.

24:26.550 --> 24:31.722
My head tells me you're right,
but my heart tells me to go.

24:32.306 --> 24:33.724
You can't save her this way.

24:34.850 --> 24:35.851
I know.

24:36.977 --> 24:38.228
She's not in there.

24:38.812 --> 24:39.813
I know.

24:42.983 --> 24:45.861
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

25:10.511 --> 25:12.471
I'm gonna ask you to look at the light.

25:22.856 --> 25:25.484
That's good. You can rest. We're done.

25:28.529 --> 25:29.613
He's okay.

25:29.613 --> 25:32.199
And you go to medical school for that?

25:32.199 --> 25:33.408
I have no explanation.

25:33.408 --> 25:37.079
Yeah. Well, there's no real explanation
for any of this, so I say we move on.

25:37.079 --> 25:38.539
Yeah?

25:38.539 --> 25:39.665
Where did you find him?

25:40.541 --> 25:42.209
Same hospital you left him in.

25:42.209 --> 25:45.462
We heard it was overrun just hours
after you left.

25:45.462 --> 25:47.631
Guess he was lucky. No thanks to you.

25:47.631 --> 25:49.842
Okay, no. Listen, these children,

25:49.842 --> 25:51.927
they were found in hospitals
all around the world

25:51.927 --> 25:55.138
after the first alien ship was shot
out of the sky. Okay?

25:55.138 --> 25:58.225
They were all struck by the blast. Psychically.

25:59.351 --> 26:00.769
How did you find us?

26:01.645 --> 26:02.855
We had this.

26:06.692 --> 26:08.193
And Caspar.

26:09.111 --> 26:11.989
He hears their voices in his head.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.368
God, this is unbelievable.

26:18.871 --> 26:21.707
We never imagined
their connection could have such range.

26:23.125 --> 26:24.585
Maybe he had help.

26:25.210 --> 26:26.628
What's that supposed to mean?

26:26.628 --> 26:27.754
Well, look,

26:28.463 --> 26:31.758
- I'm only asking, but is your friend--
- What?

26:32.759 --> 26:33.886
Himself.

26:36.221 --> 26:38.223
His connection with the aliens ran deep.

26:41.310 --> 26:42.895
Deeper than the others.

26:44.271 --> 26:45.606
Of course he's himself.

26:46.607 --> 26:47.858
He's not, Jam.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.862
He's been through a lot.

26:51.862 --> 26:53.697
- You try and act normal after--
- Don't.

26:53.697 --> 26:56.658
I'm not trying to say that.
You know I'm not trying to say that.

26:56.658 --> 26:57.951
He's my best friend.

26:57.951 --> 26:59.203
He's fine.

27:01.413 --> 27:03.081
Oi. You all got to hear this.

27:09.588 --> 27:12.007
It was like a wall going this way...

27:12.007 --> 27:14.635
- and then to the left of it, right?
- She's saying "a wall."

27:14.885 --> 27:17.971
For me it was the right.
That's where I saw him.

27:17.971 --> 27:19.181
He saw me...

27:19.181 --> 27:24.269
I saw him too, but far away, really far.

27:24.269 --> 27:27.064
Yes, exactly, me too!

27:27.064 --> 27:28.774
I was far away. They all saw me.

27:28.774 --> 27:32.528
The children have visions of,
you know, of locations, of people.

27:32.528 --> 27:35.364
We've been trying to understand
why the aliens are focusing

27:35.364 --> 27:37.407
- on certain places, but it doesn't--
- Not the visions!

27:37.407 --> 27:40.452
Not the visions! When we were asleep!

27:42.913 --> 27:44.831
They were all there. Before.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.042
When they were unconscious,
before they woke up,

27:47.042 --> 27:48.961
we were all there in the darkness.

27:49.795 --> 27:51.088
Except they woke up, and...

27:52.464 --> 27:53.966
and I stayed.

27:54.508 --> 27:57.135
Is that where you were
when I saw you in my dreams?

28:01.056 --> 28:02.432
I think so.

28:02.933 --> 28:04.226
Yeah.

28:04.226 --> 28:05.394
You think so?

28:05.394 --> 28:06.854
What is this "darkness"?

28:08.897 --> 28:10.399
I don't know. It's just...

28:11.483 --> 28:17.364
It's just dark and cold and scary.
Very scary.

28:18.866 --> 28:20.367
That's not much to go on.

28:23.328 --> 28:24.538
You could draw it.

28:24.538 --> 28:26.623
- What?
- A map.

28:26.623 --> 28:29.877
If they all saw Caspar,
they could draw a map of whatever it is.

28:29.877 --> 28:32.379
- I love maps.
- That's actually brilliant.

28:32.963 --> 28:34.840
You don't have to sound so surprised.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.133
Caspar's an artist.

28:36.633 --> 28:37.885
He can draw anything.

28:44.725 --> 28:47.686
Can we have more pink up here

28:47.686 --> 28:50.606
and then green round here?

28:52.733 --> 28:55.777
Yeah, perfect. And then green round there.

28:55.777 --> 28:58.197
And then if you can bring
a darker blue round here.

28:58.197 --> 29:00.073
'Cause I remember that's how it was.

29:00.073 --> 29:01.158
Yeah.

29:02.492 --> 29:06.330
Dark blue. Yeah. That was in there. Dark.

29:13.253 --> 29:15.130
Make the background white, at least.

29:18.967 --> 29:20.469
Everyone is excited.

29:23.138 --> 29:24.389
Yeah.

29:25.933 --> 29:27.226
You're less excited.

29:30.312 --> 29:33.857
Hey, what did you mean his connection
"ran deeper" with the aliens?

29:35.943 --> 29:37.694
We could not break it.

29:38.612 --> 29:39.947
So, then what did?

29:51.208 --> 29:52.417
Hey.

29:55.671 --> 29:57.381
Do you speak any English?

30:00.968 --> 30:02.553
Thank you for bringing us here.

30:03.804 --> 30:06.849
For calling him so we could find you.

30:08.183 --> 30:10.143
He was not the one we were calling to.

30:12.104 --> 30:13.856
You weren't calling Caspar?

30:15.274 --> 30:16.483
No.

30:17.901 --> 30:19.111
Then who?

30:20.153 --> 30:21.530
We found one more.

30:23.740 --> 30:25.534
Someone is still out there.

30:46.555 --> 30:50.475
In Hindu mythology, there's this sage, Markandeya.

30:52.102 --> 30:56.565
One day, he climbs up and out of the belly
of the world and finds himself looking out

30:56.565 --> 31:00.485
through the mouth of the great god,
Vishnu. The cosmic ocean.

31:01.111 --> 31:04.072
His mind snaps with the enormity of it.

31:05.866 --> 31:06.909
He stumbles.

31:06.909 --> 31:09.912
Falls back down the god's throat.
Smack, down to earth.

31:11.038 --> 31:14.499
He spends the next several millennia
searching for a way back out.

31:15.209 --> 31:16.418
He finally finds it,

31:17.961 --> 31:20.589
but only with the help of Shiva,
the supreme god.

31:22.299 --> 31:24.927
I think you just had the wrong partner
all this time.

31:26.094 --> 31:27.179
Come on.

31:29.848 --> 31:32.059
Let's find the cosmic ocean.

31:34.937 --> 31:35.938
What's happening?

31:42.986 --> 31:45.155
- What the--
- Suit malfunction.

31:45.155 --> 31:46.240
Let me see.

31:48.867 --> 31:50.452
What's wrong with it?

31:50.452 --> 31:53.413
The circuit's been burned.
I don't know what happened.

31:53.413 --> 31:56.250
Base Camp Three to clean room.
Prepare another suit for Mitsuki Yamato.

31:57.209 --> 31:59.002
All three suits coded to Mitsuki
are disabled.

32:00.629 --> 32:01.713
All of them?

32:10.347 --> 32:11.598
Hey!

32:13.684 --> 32:14.893
You shorted the suits.

32:15.394 --> 32:18.689
You sabotaged this project!
Our best defense against the invasion!

32:18.689 --> 32:21.275
Is it? Or is it all about you?

32:21.275 --> 32:23.110
I disabled the suits, yes.

32:23.110 --> 32:24.528
All except one.

32:24.528 --> 32:28.156
The one you're wearing.
Fitted precisely to your biometrics.

32:28.156 --> 32:30.826
So if you really believe
everything you say, go.

32:30.826 --> 32:33.996
Risk your mind, your life, for once.

32:41.420 --> 32:43.172
I stopped you from going in today.

32:44.339 --> 32:46.008
I won't be here next time.

32:46.008 --> 32:48.552
They'll have your suit repaired in a day,
maybe less.

32:49.386 --> 32:51.221
I hope your mind clears before then.

32:53.432 --> 32:55.684
You're more than
just a life to be sacrificed.

33:25.547 --> 33:26.548
What the hell?

33:26.548 --> 33:28.926
Put your hands up
and turn around real slow, Wade.

33:30.177 --> 33:31.428
Rose?

33:32.596 --> 33:33.597
Wade.

33:33.597 --> 33:37.184
Why don't you go ahead
and put the gun down?

33:37.184 --> 33:38.268
You're not gonna shoot me.

33:38.268 --> 33:40.687
Remember when that ranger came
in eighth grade,

33:40.687 --> 33:42.231
we did that marksmanship unit?

33:42.231 --> 33:45.359
He said I was a natural?
Pretty sure I can wing you.

33:45.359 --> 33:47.694
Somewhere painful, you know, not lethal.

33:47.694 --> 33:50.197
So, you're gonna step
into that cell for me.

33:50.197 --> 33:51.782
Ah, the hell I am.

33:53.408 --> 33:55.244
Okay, okay. Okay.

34:04.711 --> 34:05.712
Thank you.

34:06.880 --> 34:09.466
I figured this would be the best way
for us to have a conversation.

34:09.466 --> 34:10.842
You've gone crazy.

34:11.510 --> 34:12.844
I wish.

34:12.844 --> 34:15.304
I may be the only sane person left
in this town.

34:15.304 --> 34:18.641
So, I went by Ben Shelton's farm.

34:18.641 --> 34:20.268
That's military territory.

34:21.978 --> 34:25.815
Cal, Chet, Ben, Joanie and Sheriff Tyson.

34:25.815 --> 34:27.192
All vanished there.

34:27.192 --> 34:29.820
Hell on wheels, Rose!
Is this about your missing people?

34:29.820 --> 34:31.112
They're yours too, Wade.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.864
I know they're mine too.

34:32.864 --> 34:35.701
But the world's on fire.
I can't think about every damn thing.

34:35.701 --> 34:38.161
You stop paying attention
to the little things,

34:38.161 --> 34:39.663
you miss half the picture.

34:39.663 --> 34:40.746
Now, sit down.

34:44.458 --> 34:46.628
I want you to listen real close.

34:46.628 --> 34:48.630
I hid something in the evidence locker.

34:48.630 --> 34:53.092
It's a kid's notebook.
It's got clues, it's got answers, Wade.

34:53.092 --> 34:55.179
I know I sound like one of those people

34:55.179 --> 34:57.264
with their drawings and their theories.
I know that.

34:57.264 --> 34:59.057
But you've known me
since grade school, Wade.

34:59.057 --> 35:01.143
You know I wouldn't do a careless thing.

35:01.685 --> 35:04.188
This is real. I swear it.

35:04.980 --> 35:08.650
I need you to keep that notebook safe,
in case I don't come back.

35:08.650 --> 35:10.402
In case you don't come back?

35:10.402 --> 35:11.570
Rosey!

35:21.496 --> 35:22.748
What the hell is that?

35:23.332 --> 35:27.044
Whatever it is, it's sitting
in the center of the Shelton farm.

35:28.128 --> 35:30.756
Now, what the hell kinda installation
does the government wanna build

35:30.756 --> 35:33.300
in the middle of a cornfield?
Do you ever wonder that?

35:33.300 --> 35:34.635
They're hiding something.

35:35.135 --> 35:37.679
I think they're hiding
what happened to those people.

35:37.679 --> 35:39.973
It all centers on this farm,

35:39.973 --> 35:44.144
and I'm not waiting around
for someone to believe me. Not anymore.

35:48.774 --> 35:52.027
I'm going back to the Shelton farm,
and if I don't come back,

35:52.027 --> 35:57.658
if I end up on that missing persons wall,
I need you to take that notebook serious.

35:57.658 --> 35:58.784
Okay?

36:00.202 --> 36:01.703
Follow them clues.

36:04.206 --> 36:05.249
No. No, no, no, no.

36:05.249 --> 36:08.544
Rosey, you can't leave me in here.
Come on, we'll go talk to the sheriff.

36:08.544 --> 36:10.337
- I'll make him listen!
- You can tell Sheriff Perkins

36:10.337 --> 36:12.214
I fixed his coffee maker.

36:27.604 --> 36:32.693
Our trip to Osaka... It rained all day.

36:33.610 --> 36:37.739
On the way to a movie that we didn't like...

36:38.949 --> 36:44.162
the sun came out, and you kissed my neck...

36:47.708 --> 36:50.127
I don't know...

36:52.171 --> 36:54.631
I don't know...

36:57.426 --> 36:59.386
I don't know...

37:00.179 --> 37:02.264
So. Day one.

37:02.264 --> 37:04.975
I hate you this morning.

37:05.642 --> 37:08.020
For taking my ring.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.813
For finishing the beer.

37:09.813 --> 37:11.773
For leaving me here.

37:11.773 --> 37:13.817
I reinstalled Tinder.

37:13.817 --> 37:17.487
Don't worry, it's just to keep your side
of the bed warm...

37:18.614 --> 37:21.783
Until you get back.

37:26.997 --> 37:29.166
Wait! Stop. Stop.

37:55.984 --> 37:57.611
- What's going on?
- It's Nikhil.

37:57.611 --> 37:59.029
Who's running the safety protocols?

37:59.029 --> 38:02.282
No one. The tether is jammed,
non-operational. We can't extract him.

38:02.282 --> 38:05.452
- Turn off the magnet.
- We can't. He's rerouted the controls.

38:05.452 --> 38:08.038
Look at those sine waves.
What is he doing?

38:08.622 --> 38:10.874
- He's turning it up.
- He's fighting it.

38:10.874 --> 38:13.210
Nikhil, you have to stop!

38:13.210 --> 38:17.798
- <i>It's too unstable.</i>
- No progress without radical--

38:50.289 --> 38:57.421
Wajo! Wajo! Waj-- Wajo! Wajo!

38:57.421 --> 39:03.135
Wajo! Wajo! Wajo!

39:03.135 --> 39:05.554
Wajo!

39:06.471 --> 39:09.600
Casp, are you doing this?

39:09.600 --> 39:12.144
You're the only one not losing their mind!

39:12.644 --> 39:14.980
If you're doing this, please stop!

39:14.980 --> 39:16.064
Jam.

39:24.114 --> 39:26.116
Why is this not happening to you?

39:26.950 --> 39:27.951
I don't know.

39:27.951 --> 39:29.161
Let's go.

39:29.161 --> 39:30.704
Quick! Come with me.

39:33.081 --> 39:35.751
Everyone, out of the lab! Now!

39:46.845 --> 39:47.971
Nikhil!

39:48.555 --> 39:49.806
Nikhil.

40:25.968 --> 40:29.596
Clusters of epicenters in Eastern Europe,
North America and the Amazon.

40:33.767 --> 40:35.018
Get me Nikhil now.

40:35.561 --> 40:36.645
Yes, Madam.

40:41.024 --> 40:42.401
<i>We have to evacuate.</i>

40:42.401 --> 40:44.611
<i>All personnel evacuate the site immediately.</i>

40:44.611 --> 40:46.488
<i>All personnel evacuate the site.</i>

40:55.789 --> 40:57.708
Nikhil! Nik--

41:12.389 --> 41:13.640
Why is it not stopping?

41:17.144 --> 41:18.145
I don't know.

41:25.235 --> 41:28.030
Let's go! Let's go! Oh, shit!

41:31.867 --> 41:34.745
Grab whatever you can, and strap it down!

41:54.640 --> 41:56.308
- Hey! Hey!
- Let's go!

41:57.893 --> 41:59.520
Hey, what's going on out there?

41:59.520 --> 42:00.687
Hey!

42:03.440 --> 42:04.483
Hey!

42:06.652 --> 42:07.861
Who the hell are you?

42:09.988 --> 42:11.240
Cool it 15 degrees.

42:11.740 --> 42:13.659
We're losing structural integrity.

42:13.659 --> 42:16.453
<i>Base station,
I'm patching a call through from the WDC.</i>

42:16.453 --> 42:17.996
Got it. On the screen.

42:17.996 --> 42:19.331
<i>Where is Nikhil?</i>

42:21.625 --> 42:22.835
Not available.

42:22.835 --> 42:24.711
We're a little busy here, Madam President.

42:24.711 --> 42:28.298
<i>We're recording global seismic activity
and you're the primary epicenter.</i>

42:28.298 --> 42:29.842
- <i>What have you done?</i>
- We just--

42:29.842 --> 42:31.969
<i>Whatever it was, stop it now.</i>

42:31.969 --> 42:34.012
We don't know how.
The entity is out of control.

42:34.012 --> 42:35.430
<i>Let me be clear.</i>

42:35.430 --> 42:38.350
<i>We have a global seismic event
with multiple epicenters.</i>

42:38.350 --> 42:41.103
<i>We have to stop it
before it gets any worse.</i>

42:51.446 --> 42:52.573
I think I can do it.

42:52.573 --> 42:54.491
I sabotaged the suits.

42:54.491 --> 42:56.952
You don't even have a--
You won't be tethered.

42:58.120 --> 42:59.913
You could be trapped in there.

42:59.913 --> 43:01.415
I have to try.

43:01.415 --> 43:02.833
I have to try, Maya.

43:04.209 --> 43:06.295
I'm the only one she'll let in.

43:18.765 --> 43:20.142
Hinata...

43:23.020 --> 43:24.396
Hinata!

43:27.858 --> 43:31.904
Why did you hurt me again...?

43:33.030 --> 43:35.032
I didn't...

43:36.408 --> 43:38.994
I never wanted...

43:39.536 --> 43:42.456
...never meant to hurt you...

43:43.207 --> 43:44.666
Ever...

43:45.626 --> 43:49.046
Then come back to me.

43:49.046 --> 43:52.466
I said those words so many times.

43:52.466 --> 43:55.260
"Come back to me..."

43:59.848 --> 44:02.476
"Come back, Hinata."

44:05.270 --> 44:08.065
"Come back, Hinata."

44:51.191 --> 44:54.736
I know what pain feels like...

44:57.447 --> 45:00.409
I've lived with it every day
since she left...

45:00.409 --> 45:02.619
You left...

45:03.120 --> 45:06.081
Then let go of your world...

45:06.081 --> 45:08.542
and come to mine...

45:08.542 --> 45:11.336
We can be together.

45:12.254 --> 45:15.215
We'll always be together.

45:19.428 --> 45:22.306
But not like this...

45:24.683 --> 45:26.268
because...

45:28.520 --> 45:31.565
my Hinata is dead...

46:42.261 --> 46:44.471
Okay, this is gonna sting. All right?

46:59.528 --> 47:00.779
You pulled away from me.

47:02.990 --> 47:04.199
I know.

47:05.784 --> 47:06.910
I know, Casp.

47:06.910 --> 47:08.412
It's just--

47:08.412 --> 47:11.331
I feel like some part of you
is still with them.

47:12.082 --> 47:13.584
And I need to know which part.

47:15.127 --> 47:16.378
Casp,

47:17.337 --> 47:18.797
whose side are you on?

47:20.924 --> 47:22.134
I'm not with them.

47:25.846 --> 47:27.014
I don't wanna be.

47:30.976 --> 47:33.228
I saw your face
when I showed you the drawing.

47:35.439 --> 47:39.151
It was everything to me.
I looked at it every day, for months.

47:43.405 --> 47:45.574
You don't even remember drawing it,
do you?

47:55.626 --> 47:56.710
Look at it.

48:00.672 --> 48:02.174
Casp, look.

48:04.593 --> 48:05.719
Are you here?

48:06.303 --> 48:07.679
Or are you still there?

48:18.982 --> 48:20.442
Nikhil!

48:52.850 --> 48:55.185
Mitsuki, what are you doing?

48:56.186 --> 48:59.982
Checking the readings from Nikhil's suit,
from when he went into the alien.

49:03.360 --> 49:06.697
The atmosphere, it wasn't ours.

49:12.119 --> 49:14.371
Maya, the alien--

49:17.875 --> 49:19.376
It was a portal.

49:21.461 --> 49:22.921
Our way in.

49:24.715 --> 49:27.134
It was our only way into their world.

49:28.427 --> 49:29.845
And I destroyed it.

49:33.307 --> 49:34.850
I destroyed it.
