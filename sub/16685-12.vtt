39:38.744 --> 39:39.976
More than one!

39:39.978 --> 39:41.778
- Try anything,
and you know what happens.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.646
- Careful.
Careful.

39:43.648 --> 39:46.116
- I see one!
- Then, shoot!

39:46.118 --> 39:48.518
- Careful.
Careful.

39:49.588 --> 39:50.653
- [yells]

39:56.161 --> 39:57.827
It's them!

39:57.829 --> 39:59.796
- Son of a bitch!
- Get down!

40:01.099 --> 40:02.165
- [groans]

40:10.108 --> 40:11.408
- Dad.

40:11.410 --> 40:12.542
Dad.
- Is he hit?

40:12.544 --> 40:13.843
- No, he looks okay.
He's breathing.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.745
- You okay?
- Head up.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.480
- No, he missed me.

40:17.482 --> 40:18.948
- He wouldn't have
if it wasn't for Sarah.

40:18.950 --> 40:19.682
Sarah.

40:19.684 --> 40:22.419
Sarah!
- Get up.

40:22.421 --> 40:23.953
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, yeah, he missed me.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.488
- You all right?
You okay?

40:25.490 --> 40:27.791
- I think that I'm an adept.

40:27.793 --> 40:29.726
- What the hell is that?
- I'm not really sure.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.161
- Mom! Dad!
- Oh, my God.

40:31.162 --> 40:32.595
- What are you doing here?
- What happened?

40:32.597 --> 40:34.097
- I told you
to stay at the tower.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.999
- It was a skinwalker, Mom.
Mom, a skinwalker got Dana.

40:36.001 --> 40:37.534
- Yeah, but Bree got rid of it.

40:37.536 --> 40:38.968
Dad--Dad, there's something
about that tower.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.170
It--it--
- All by itself.

40:40.172 --> 40:41.671
- It started broadcasting
the Moondog.

40:41.673 --> 40:42.872
- On its own.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.541
- Do you think
he's in the tower, or--

40:44.543 --> 40:45.942
- He's here.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.211
Among us.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.079
- Where's Sarah?
- I don't know.

40:50.081 --> 40:52.582
She was right there.
It's like she just vanished.

40:52.584 --> 40:53.883
- Matt, we'll look for Sarah
in a second.

40:53.885 --> 40:55.051
We need to find Moondog--
- No, look.

40:55.053 --> 40:56.486
Sarah's gone.
I got to go find her.

40:56.488 --> 40:57.854
- What are you talking about?

40:57.856 --> 40:59.522
This is the last event.
You're staying with your family.

40:59.524 --> 41:00.924
- You and Dad knew
you were gonna get married

41:00.926 --> 41:02.259
on your first date, okay?

41:02.260 --> 41:03.593
Sarah's part of this family now.
I'll be right back.

41:03.595 --> 41:04.878
- Matt!
- I'll be back.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.162
- Matt, wait!
- Brianna, where are you going?

41:06.164 --> 41:08.198
- No one goes anywhere
in this family alone, Mom.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.532
We'll be back.

41:09.534 --> 41:11.100
- How do you know that?
- I just know!

41:12.704 --> 41:14.804
- You're gonna let 'em
go off like that? Josh!

41:14.806 --> 41:16.005
- Easy.
- Mom, we have to.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.407
We don't have any more time.

41:17.408 --> 41:18.808
If--if we don't find the Moondog
right now,

41:18.810 --> 41:19.976
none of this even matters.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.245
- He's here.

41:22.247 --> 41:23.246
- What?

41:23.248 --> 41:24.214
- He's here.

41:26.051 --> 41:27.717
- [yelling]

41:27.719 --> 41:28.718
[gunshot]

41:28.720 --> 41:31.020
- [gasps]

41:31.022 --> 41:33.490
- Hey.
I got him.

41:33.492 --> 41:35.625
I'm not normally a good shot.

41:37.496 --> 41:39.262
Hi.
How are you guys?

41:39.264 --> 41:40.163
How you doing?

41:43.635 --> 41:45.835
- Moondog.
- Yeah.

41:45.837 --> 41:50.139
In the ever-livin', ever-lovin',
all-too-solid flesh, my brother.

41:52.077 --> 41:54.744
- They checked in there earlier,
and you weren't there.

41:54.746 --> 41:57.146
- Well, you know,
you gots to know where to look.

41:57.148 --> 41:58.081
Or--or when.

41:59.518 --> 42:01.284
- Yeah.
Or when.

42:01.286 --> 42:03.086
- Or when.

42:05.724 --> 42:06.890
- It's really him.

42:08.059 --> 42:10.059
- I've been looking for you.

42:10.061 --> 42:12.111
- It's funny, that.

42:12.112 --> 42:14.162
I think I may have been
looking for you.

42:14.165 --> 42:16.766
You by any chance that adept
I've been looking for?

42:16.768 --> 42:18.668
- Yeah, I think I am.

42:18.670 --> 42:21.538
- Well, then,
let's howl together, brother.

42:21.540 --> 42:22.639
We don't got all day.

42:26.778 --> 42:29.012
