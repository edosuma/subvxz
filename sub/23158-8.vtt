WEBVTT

00:01.090 --> 00:03.217
There's a guy
falling out of that plane.

00:03.293 --> 00:04.282
Look out!

00:04.360 --> 00:05.486
I got a friend in here

00:05.561 --> 00:07.426
with his jaw wired shut
because of you.

00:07.497 --> 00:09.465
All I want you to
do is keep him alive

00:09.532 --> 00:11.796
long enough for me to
collect back alimony.

00:13.568 --> 00:15.230
You're destroying
Robin's wall.

00:15.305 --> 00:17.296
You sound
exactly like Higgins.

00:17.373 --> 00:18.567
You've met Mad Buck?

00:18.641 --> 00:20.800
Mad Buck.

00:20.847 --> 00:21.570
What are you
looking at?

00:21.644 --> 00:22.611
You, loudmouth.

00:22.679 --> 00:23.668
Buck, no, no! Come on.

00:25.214 --> 00:26.306
You wanna race?

00:26.449 --> 00:27.541
Buck, pull over.

01:47.630 --> 01:49.598
<i>You know, there are</i>
<i>some quotations</i>

01:49.665 --> 01:51.565
<i>that would make</i>
<i>good rules to live by.</i>

01:51.634 --> 01:52.601
<i>For instance,</i>

01:52.668 --> 01:54.659
<i>"Never drive behind</i>
<i>an old man wearing a hat."</i>

01:54.737 --> 01:55.795
<i>Or another,</i>

01:55.871 --> 01:58.339
<i>"It's always brightest</i>
<i>Just before the storm."</i>

01:58.407 --> 01:59.897
<i>If I'd remembered that one,</i>

01:59.976 --> 02:02.171
<i>I'd really have</i>
<i>been on my guard</i>

02:02.245 --> 02:04.213
<i>because the afternoon</i>
<i>it all started</i>

02:04.280 --> 02:06.544
<i>was a truly beautiful day.</i>

02:06.616 --> 02:07.708
Magnum.

02:10.051 --> 02:11.280
One moment, please.

02:11.354 --> 02:12.446
Higgins,
if you don't mind,

02:12.521 --> 02:13.647
I'm sort of
in a hurry.

02:13.723 --> 02:14.781
I can
well imagine.

02:14.857 --> 02:16.586
A pressing date
with your surf ski

02:16.659 --> 02:17.717
or are you
rendezvousing

02:17.793 --> 02:19.260
with one of your
divorcee clients

02:19.328 --> 02:20.693
just beyond
the breakers?

02:20.763 --> 02:22.958
As a matter of fact,
I'm running, paddling,

02:23.032 --> 02:25.193
then running again,
against the clock.

02:25.268 --> 02:26.895
So time is
very important.

02:26.969 --> 02:28.596
All that without
wearing a watch?

02:28.671 --> 02:30.536
How fiendishly
ingenious of you.

02:30.606 --> 02:32.506
The time is
running in my head,

02:32.575 --> 02:34.543
it's like an Olympic
athlete in competition.

02:34.610 --> 02:37.170
Who could have thought
one so aggressively prosaic

02:37.246 --> 02:40.181
could have such
an extraordinary fantasy life?

02:41.784 --> 02:43.684
All right.
Forget it, okay?

02:43.753 --> 02:44.913
You satisfied?

02:44.987 --> 02:46.477
It's too late
to run for time now.

02:46.555 --> 02:47.852
Tell me what is it
you want.

02:47.923 --> 02:49.788
Your surf ski,
clothing, and footprints

02:49.859 --> 02:51.451
are on my beach.

02:51.527 --> 02:52.755
Your beach?

02:52.828 --> 02:54.295
You've staked
a claim down here?

02:54.363 --> 02:56.263
For my tournament.
Beach croquet.

02:56.332 --> 02:57.629
As you can plainly see,

02:57.700 --> 03:00.168
the surface has been
expertly raked and rolled.

03:00.503 --> 03:01.800
Beach croquet?

03:01.871 --> 03:04.305
It's a fundraising tournament
for the Art Affiliates.

03:04.373 --> 03:06.000
We're sponsoring
a worthy young artist

03:06.075 --> 03:07.337
for a year in Paris.

03:07.410 --> 03:09.674
If you'd, uh, like to
buy a ticket...

03:09.745 --> 03:11.679
No, I think
I'll just excuse myself

03:11.747 --> 03:12.941
and pick up my things.

03:13.015 --> 03:15.848
I'll even rake my footprints,
if you want.

03:16.018 --> 03:19.112
I thought the word "buy"
would send you scampering.

03:19.188 --> 03:21.850
<i>I know what you're thinking,</i>
<i>but this time you're wrong.</i>

03:21.924 --> 03:24.051
<i>The run-in with Higgins</i>
<i>wasn't the storm.</i>

03:24.126 --> 03:26.287
<i>It was barely</i>
<i>the opening thunderclap.</i>

03:26.362 --> 03:27.351
Thomas!

03:27.797 --> 03:29.230
I know, I know.

03:29.298 --> 03:30.959
I'm raking it up
as fast as I can.

03:31.901 --> 03:33.095
Thomas.

03:35.338 --> 03:37.704
Listen, there's a client
at the bar. A real one.

03:37.773 --> 03:39.866
She even looks like
she could pay her own bills.

03:39.942 --> 03:41.603
Come on, let's go.

03:41.744 --> 03:44.144
<i>Malevolent, vile,</i>
<i>self-centered,</i>

03:44.280 --> 03:46.714
<i>self-indulgent,</i>
<i>not to mention selfish,</i>

03:46.782 --> 03:48.511
and a decorated foe

03:48.584 --> 03:50.017
of the entire
women's movement.

03:51.153 --> 03:52.848
And you want
Thomas to baby-sit?

03:52.922 --> 03:55.652
Only until I collect
a debt he owes me.

03:56.659 --> 03:58.650
But what
makes you think

03:58.728 --> 04:00.093
he needs protecting,
Mrs. Gibson?

04:00.162 --> 04:01.595
Is somebody
out to get him?

04:01.664 --> 04:04.792
Oh, there are only about
140 announced suspects.

04:05.034 --> 04:07.696
But the only one
I'm interested in is himself.

04:07.770 --> 04:10.102
Wait a minute,
I thought Buck was a successful writer.

04:10.172 --> 04:11.434
Oh, he is...

04:11.507 --> 04:13.600
If you want to call
"success" being known

04:13.676 --> 04:16.372
for trashy paperbacks
with covers of

04:16.445 --> 04:18.208
voluptuous blondes
and heroes who are...

04:18.279 --> 04:19.872
Isn't he a friend
of Robin Masters?

04:19.949 --> 04:21.348
Only for about 30 years.

04:21.416 --> 04:22.816
So if he is
coming to the Islands,

04:22.885 --> 04:24.113
he'll be staying
at the estate.

04:24.186 --> 04:26.154
I'm not so sure
about the ethics

04:26.222 --> 04:28.019
of secretly
protecting someone

04:28.090 --> 04:30.024
who's enjoying
Robin's hospitality.

04:30.092 --> 04:32.117
Now look, the ethics
are completely different

04:32.194 --> 04:33.752
between a client
and potential victim

04:33.829 --> 04:34.887
if they're related.

04:34.964 --> 04:36.693
Well, I mean,
in a sort of way.

04:36.966 --> 04:38.490
You see, Mr. Magnum,

04:38.567 --> 04:40.558
I am the original
Mrs. Mad Buck.

04:40.636 --> 04:42.695
Many years ago in Paris.

04:42.838 --> 04:44.897
And the debt
I'm trying to collect is

04:44.974 --> 04:47.442
back alimony.
20 years of it.

04:47.510 --> 04:48.943
Now I have a court order.

04:49.011 --> 04:50.911
All I want you to do
is keep him alive

04:50.980 --> 04:52.845
long enough
for me to collect.

04:52.915 --> 04:54.212
So you and Buck were...

04:54.283 --> 04:55.750
Married. Yes.

04:56.318 --> 04:57.444
Is this some sort of

04:57.520 --> 04:59.681
investigative technique
you've perfected?

04:59.755 --> 05:01.188
I make a statement

05:01.257 --> 05:03.225
and you repeat it
with a question?

05:05.294 --> 05:07.319
It's not that.
It's just confusing, see,

05:07.396 --> 05:10.923
because I've met three other
wives of Buck's and somehow...

05:11.000 --> 05:13.525
You are exactly right.
Let me say it.

05:13.602 --> 05:15.035
I am not now,

05:15.104 --> 05:17.572
nor have I ever been,
a chorus girl.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.801
The sum total of
my measurements

05:19.875 --> 05:21.638
do not exceed my IQ.

05:21.977 --> 05:24.070
And the last time,
the only time

05:24.146 --> 05:25.909
Buck ever called me
"Tootsie",

05:25.981 --> 05:27.141
I punched him out.

05:27.216 --> 05:29.480
Yeah, well, I can't imagine
why you two ever split up.

05:29.552 --> 05:31.019
Neither can I.

05:31.086 --> 05:34.487
First I thought it was just
because he hated marriage.

05:34.557 --> 05:37.185
Are you sure that, uh,
he's coming to the Islands?

05:37.259 --> 05:38.351
Because we haven't heard...

05:38.427 --> 05:40.190
He took an early flight
out of New York.

05:40.262 --> 05:41.752
He should be here
any minute.

05:47.570 --> 05:49.299
What the hell is he doing?

05:49.705 --> 05:52.071
There's a guy
falling out of that plane.

05:52.141 --> 05:54.268
Dramatic,
but hardly original.

05:55.077 --> 05:56.510
Mad Buck?

05:58.447 --> 05:59.812
It's the way he arrived

05:59.882 --> 06:02.350
at the Cannes Film Festival
three years ago.

06:03.486 --> 06:05.818
The only reason
people noticed him then,

06:05.888 --> 06:07.116
when it was original,

06:07.189 --> 06:11.023
was he was holding
a naked starlet at the time.

06:11.293 --> 06:13.227
Yeah? Well, this time
he's not gonna make it

06:13.295 --> 06:15.320
'cause the wind's blowing him
right into the reef.

06:15.397 --> 06:16.386
It's suicide.

06:21.203 --> 06:23.330
Even if he misses the reef,
the surf is heavy.

06:23.405 --> 06:26.033
He could drown before he
gets out of his harness.

06:28.244 --> 06:29.871
A naked starlet?

06:30.079 --> 06:32.946
She was Scandinavian,
so it really didn't count.

06:34.884 --> 06:36.909
<i>"Mad Buck" Gibson</i>

06:37.086 --> 06:38.485
<i>got his name from being</i>

06:38.554 --> 06:40.818
<i>one of the most</i>
<i>adventure-crazed men alive.</i>

06:40.890 --> 06:44.326
<i>Big game in Africa,</i>
<i>mountain climbing in Nepal,</i>

06:44.393 --> 06:46.554
<i>deep-sea fishing in</i>
<i>the Florida Keys...</i>

06:46.629 --> 06:48.358
<i>And when he wasn't</i>
<i>doing that,</i>

06:48.430 --> 06:50.330
<i>he turned out</i>
<i>adventure novels</i>

06:50.399 --> 06:52.264
<i>that were almost</i>
<i>as colorful as his life.</i>

06:52.334 --> 06:53.892
<i>The only trouble was</i>

06:53.969 --> 06:56.028
<i>that life was</i>
<i>in its final chapter</i>

06:56.105 --> 06:57.367
<i>if I couldn't</i>
<i>set a new record</i>

06:57.439 --> 06:59.407
<i>breaking through the surf.</i>

06:59.508 --> 07:01.476
He went out to save him.

07:01.544 --> 07:03.637
Legally,
do you think that constitutes

07:03.712 --> 07:05.771
an acceptance
of my employment?

07:05.848 --> 07:07.179
Hey, look.

07:08.851 --> 07:10.113
The wind has shifted.

07:10.185 --> 07:12.050
He's headed for
the south beach.

07:20.763 --> 07:21.991
Higgins!

07:22.056 --> 07:23.489
Don't look around,
Mrs. Barnes.

07:23.566 --> 07:25.090
It's obviously
some intoxicated...

07:25.167 --> 07:26.259
Higgins!

07:26.335 --> 07:28.200
Look out below!

07:28.270 --> 07:30.465
Higgins! Look out!

07:50.826 --> 07:52.418
Just
a separated shoulder...

07:52.494 --> 07:54.086
Higgins,
if there's anything...

07:54.163 --> 07:55.323
...two cracked ribs,

07:55.397 --> 07:57.194
numbers 4 and 5
on the left side...

07:57.266 --> 07:58.392
Higgins,
if you just...

07:58.467 --> 07:59.525
...a slight
concussion

07:59.602 --> 08:00.830
and an assortment
of abrasions,

08:00.903 --> 08:02.461
all second degree.

08:02.538 --> 08:05.006
I should be back at
the front in no time.

08:05.774 --> 08:07.139
The front?

08:07.276 --> 08:08.641
I mean the estate.

08:09.678 --> 08:11.976
Now, how exactly

08:12.047 --> 08:14.038
did this ruddy nonsense
happen anyway?

08:14.116 --> 08:16.084
You don't remember
Rick yelling at you?

08:16.151 --> 08:17.550
Of course
I do.

08:17.620 --> 08:19.679
My faculties are
perfectly intact.

08:19.989 --> 08:22.048
Nona Barnes and I
were setting out the wickets

08:22.124 --> 08:23.523
on the croquet court.

08:23.592 --> 08:26.083
I heard Rick but
elected to ignore him.

08:26.662 --> 08:30.564
Now, exactly how did
the accident occur?

08:32.735 --> 08:35.226
You know,
that Mrs. Barnes, she's...

08:35.770 --> 08:38.261
She's really quite intrepid.
She's proceeding

08:38.340 --> 08:40.365
with the tournament
despite your injuries.

08:40.442 --> 08:41.932
Well, of course, she is.

08:42.010 --> 08:45.139
Nona comes from sturdy,
resilient pioneer stock.

08:46.749 --> 08:49.115
Now, a-a-about
the accident.

08:49.184 --> 08:51.550
You were hit
by a parachutist.

08:52.821 --> 08:53.810
What?

08:56.425 --> 08:58.052
You were hit by a parachutist.

08:58.627 --> 08:59.753
How?

09:00.863 --> 09:01.921
How...

09:01.997 --> 09:03.328
Blown off course
by the wind.

09:03.399 --> 09:05.230
You know how unpredictable
the wind can be.

09:05.300 --> 09:06.289
Who?

09:07.302 --> 09:11.932
Who could possibly
be so irresponsible,

09:12.007 --> 09:15.841
so criminally negligent? So...

09:17.413 --> 09:19.142
Higgins,
this is the funny part.

09:19.214 --> 09:21.580
It's a friend of Robin's.
A writer.

09:21.984 --> 09:23.747
Well, look, I'm sorry.

09:23.819 --> 09:25.650
I got to let you
get some sleep.

09:27.122 --> 09:29.249
You know, Higgins,
you look really tired.

09:29.324 --> 09:32.259
I must be more seriously hurt
than I imagined.

09:32.461 --> 09:34.190
It couldn't
possibly be

09:35.631 --> 09:38.498
"Mad Buck" Gibson.

09:38.567 --> 09:40.057
You've met Mad Buck?

09:41.336 --> 09:42.963
One further question

09:43.038 --> 09:45.063
in this masochistic
interrogation.

09:46.275 --> 09:49.438
Is it just barely possible
that Mr. Gibson,

09:49.945 --> 09:52.413
having failed
in his kamikaze mission,

09:53.082 --> 09:55.073
is going to get
back in his plane

09:55.384 --> 09:57.147
and leave the Islands?

09:58.454 --> 10:00.979
You're not here to
drive him to the airport?

10:02.624 --> 10:03.818
Actually,

10:03.892 --> 10:05.951
I'm here to drive him
back to the estate.

10:06.028 --> 10:09.191
As a personal and honored
guest of Robin Masters.

10:11.800 --> 10:12.858
Ta.

10:17.306 --> 10:19.536
Mad Buck.

10:20.609 --> 10:21.871
Magnum!

10:22.811 --> 10:24.278
Meet Marlene.

10:24.980 --> 10:27.881
Marlene.
Here. Meet Magnum.

10:27.950 --> 10:28.974
Hi.

10:29.051 --> 10:31.042
You know, I told these idiots
in this hospital

10:31.120 --> 10:33.054
that I could walk
out of here, but now...

10:33.122 --> 10:35.090
There you go, hold my sticks,
will you, buddy?

10:35.157 --> 10:37.387
But now that I got her,
I think I'm gonna hire her

10:37.459 --> 10:39.484
to be my personal
chauffeur forever.

10:39.561 --> 10:41.222
Darling, if I were
two years younger,

10:41.296 --> 10:42.923
you'd be
in big, big trouble.

10:42.998 --> 10:44.488
As a matter of fact,
promise me

10:44.566 --> 10:47.626
you won't get engaged until I
get out of this plaster, huh?

10:48.437 --> 10:50.667
They're getting prettier
and younger every year.

10:50.739 --> 10:52.206
Bye, Marlene.

10:52.641 --> 10:55.007
You know, the last time
I saw her namesake,

10:55.077 --> 10:56.476
I was up in Tarcento,

10:56.545 --> 10:58.240
up in the Italian Alps
near Yugoslavia.

10:58.313 --> 10:59.644
She was
entertaining the troops

10:59.715 --> 11:00.943
and I was covering
the Big Bang

11:01.016 --> 11:02.415
for old
Uncle Henry Louis.

11:02.484 --> 11:04.475
<i>Ms. Gillson,</i>
<i>please report to X-ray...</i>

11:04.553 --> 11:07.078
It seems like yesterday
about 200 years ago.

11:07.389 --> 11:08.515
Come on, Buck.

11:08.590 --> 11:10.182
I'll get you back
to the estate.

11:10.259 --> 11:12.352
Uh, no, no, no,
I gotta see Higgie in here.

11:13.462 --> 11:15.089
I'm sorry I made
such a mess of things,

11:15.164 --> 11:17.189
but I was sure that
was an onshore breeze.

11:17.266 --> 11:18.665
Look, I was just in there.

11:18.734 --> 11:20.531
I don't think it's
a good time to see him.

11:20.602 --> 11:21.933
He's taken
a lot of painkillers.

11:22.004 --> 11:24.029
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah,
gotcha.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.800
Well...

11:27.209 --> 11:29.234
You know, I think I could
do this better one-handed.

11:29.311 --> 11:30.835
Here. Race me.

11:32.347 --> 11:34.076
I'll race you.

11:37.719 --> 11:38.981
I won!

11:39.054 --> 11:40.715
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

11:40.789 --> 11:42.416
<i>Higgins' reaction to Mad Buck</i>

11:42.491 --> 11:44.083
<i>should have been</i>
<i>the final tip-off.</i>

11:44.159 --> 11:45.524
<i>But I have to be honest</i>
<i>with you.</i>

11:45.594 --> 11:47.255
<i>I read a few of Buck's books</i>

11:47.329 --> 11:50.162
<i>under the covers with a</i>
<i>flashlight when I was growing up,</i>

11:50.232 --> 11:53.167
<i>and I was a little curious</i>
<i>to see him in action up close.</i>

11:54.036 --> 11:55.025
Hi.

11:55.170 --> 11:57.638
<i>I just wish I'd remembered</i>
<i>those old sayings</i>

11:57.706 --> 12:00.004
<i>about the price</i>
<i>you pay for curiosity.</i>

12:01.076 --> 12:03.374
Hello.
The gardener let me in.

12:03.912 --> 12:06.073
He also told me
about Higgins.

12:06.248 --> 12:08.614
He is going to be
all right, isn't he?

12:08.884 --> 12:10.647
Well, when I saw him,

12:10.719 --> 12:12.812
he seemed a little out of it
from the medication,

12:12.888 --> 12:14.321
but I don't think
it's too serious.

12:14.389 --> 12:15.481
Good.

12:15.557 --> 12:19.391
I guess that leaves one item of
unfinished business between us.

12:19.862 --> 12:21.193
My protecting Buck.

12:21.263 --> 12:22.491
Exactly.

12:22.831 --> 12:24.958
Now why do I
sense reluctance here?

12:25.033 --> 12:27.524
And don't talk to me
about conflict of interest.

12:27.636 --> 12:29.797
I think
it's deeper than that.

12:30.172 --> 12:32.402
Okay. I'll be honest
with you.

12:33.308 --> 12:36.072
I think I understand,
or maybe even sympathize

12:36.144 --> 12:37.805
with what
Buck's going through.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.177
Funny, you don't
look like

12:39.248 --> 12:41.773
a man with a degree
in abnormal psychologies.

12:42.484 --> 12:45.180
Well, it's hard to explain,
Mrs. Gibson.

12:46.355 --> 12:47.413
It's just that...

12:47.489 --> 12:50.185
It's just that a woman
wouldn't understand, right?

12:50.259 --> 12:51.920
I didn't say that.

12:52.027 --> 12:54.154
Buck's been
very physical all his life.

12:54.229 --> 12:55.628
One day, he wakes up,

12:55.697 --> 12:57.665
sees his beard turning gray,

12:57.733 --> 12:59.325
weighs a couple
of extra pounds,

12:59.401 --> 13:00.527
he's a step slower,

13:00.602 --> 13:03.070
maybe even more
than a step, so...

13:03.138 --> 13:05.197
So he tries tougher
and tougher stunts,

13:05.540 --> 13:07.633
like jumping
out of airplanes?

13:07.910 --> 13:09.343
Come on,
Mr. Magnum.

13:09.478 --> 13:10.945
That's not
youth recaptured.

13:11.013 --> 13:12.139
That's insanity.

13:12.214 --> 13:14.011
I didn't say
it was okay.

13:14.082 --> 13:15.709
I just said
I understood.

13:15.784 --> 13:18.810
It's like my friends and I
when we remember Vietnam.

13:18.887 --> 13:21.082
It was so terrible there,
I don't think

13:21.156 --> 13:23.021
there's any words
to describe it, and yet...

13:23.091 --> 13:24.752
You were never
more alive.

13:28.730 --> 13:30.630
Well, it's not
that we're old.

13:31.533 --> 13:33.899
It's just that
we're not young anymore.

13:34.503 --> 13:36.130
Because you
understand,

13:36.204 --> 13:37.933
you're the one
who can help Buck.

13:39.107 --> 13:40.301
Besides,

13:40.375 --> 13:41.774
I don't want him
to kill himself

13:41.843 --> 13:43.310
before I get
my settlement.

13:43.378 --> 13:45.005
So get on
with it.

14:49.110 --> 14:51.305
Magnum, I hope
I didn't wake you.

14:51.378 --> 14:53.471
But as long as
you're up, come on in.

14:58.285 --> 14:59.309
Why?

14:59.520 --> 15:01.385
Why are you
shooting at the wall?

15:01.455 --> 15:03.013
Practice, my boy,
practice.

15:03.090 --> 15:04.853
Got to keep
those reflexes ready.

15:04.925 --> 15:07.485
You know,
I don't mean any disrespect,

15:07.895 --> 15:11.296
but if you intend to be
a worid-class investigator,

15:11.365 --> 15:12.730
you better learn this.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.825
Buck, I only use a gun
as a last resort,

15:14.902 --> 15:17.462
but when I do,
I got a pretty good idea how to use it.

15:17.538 --> 15:19.369
Yeah, sure, sure,
watch this now.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.068
I learned this in kill camp.

15:25.312 --> 15:26.574
Named after
Mozambique

15:26.647 --> 15:28.706
because that's where
the pattern was established.

15:28.782 --> 15:30.807
I don't care how
they shoot in Mozambique.

15:30.885 --> 15:32.352
Here, we only fire
when we mean it.

15:32.419 --> 15:33.852
I only fire when I mean it.

15:33.921 --> 15:35.684
And you know what
a.45 slug will do.

15:35.756 --> 15:38.088
It could've gone right
through and nailed me in bed.

15:38.159 --> 15:39.421
Not to mention the wall.

15:39.493 --> 15:41.358
You're destroying
Robin's wall.

15:41.428 --> 15:43.157
Did anybody ever
tell you that sometimes

15:43.230 --> 15:44.925
you sound
exactly like Higgins?

15:44.999 --> 15:46.227
Higgins?

15:46.634 --> 15:47.896
Higgins.

15:47.968 --> 15:49.629
He comes home
this morning.

15:49.703 --> 15:51.000
If you
really think about it,

15:51.071 --> 15:53.562
I'm... I'm really adding
value to the property.

15:53.641 --> 15:54.630
You see,

15:54.742 --> 15:56.676
instead of just
a wall with holes in it,

15:56.744 --> 15:58.939
now it's
an artistic creation.

15:59.013 --> 16:01.004
I mean,
I'll... I'll even sign it.

16:02.082 --> 16:03.276
Magnum?

16:19.533 --> 16:21.899
Higgins. You're back.

16:21.969 --> 16:24.164
That's terrific,
but should you be out of bed?

16:24.238 --> 16:26.536
I think I should just
walk you back to the house...

16:26.607 --> 16:30.099
I heard gunfire and thought it
only prudent to investigate.

16:30.544 --> 16:32.739
Gunfire? Shots?

16:34.048 --> 16:36.141
Well, maybe there were
just a couple.

16:36.217 --> 16:38.242
I counted 12,
to be exact.

16:38.319 --> 16:40.617
A.45 automatic,
from the sound of it,

16:40.688 --> 16:42.679
fired in the international
Mozambique pattern,

16:42.756 --> 16:43.984
if I'm not
mistaken.

16:44.058 --> 16:45.753
And since that's
hardly a technique

16:45.826 --> 16:47.293
prominent
in divorce court,

16:47.361 --> 16:48.953
the person
firing those shots

16:49.029 --> 16:50.462
could only
have been...

16:50.531 --> 16:52.556
He's making
the bathroom wall famous.

16:52.633 --> 16:53.657
Please.

16:53.734 --> 16:56.362
Spare me the depressingly
unimaginative details.

16:56.437 --> 16:58.803
Instead, let me
ask you a question,

16:58.872 --> 17:00.396
your opinion, actually,

17:00.474 --> 17:02.032
of the lovely
neo-classical fountain

17:02.109 --> 17:03.804
in the courtyard
of the estate

17:03.877 --> 17:07.368
and the way it compliments
Mr. Masters' new Rolls-Royce.

17:07.448 --> 17:09.279
I think I better get you
back to the house.

17:09.349 --> 17:10.476
The walk down here must...

17:10.550 --> 17:11.983
That blank look on
your face is,

17:12.051 --> 17:14.077
for once,
uniquely appropriate,

17:14.154 --> 17:17.055
because there is
no fountain, no Rolls-Royce.

17:17.124 --> 17:20.252
On his last visit here,
Mr. Gibson destroyed both

17:20.327 --> 17:21.919
when he attempted
to jump the fountain

17:21.996 --> 17:23.463
with the car.

17:24.131 --> 17:25.530
Anyone hurt?

17:26.267 --> 17:28.758
One of the gardeners
developed hysterical amnesia,

17:28.836 --> 17:30.394
but that is not
my point.

17:30.471 --> 17:33.702
Buck Gibson is a demonstrable
menace to this household.

17:33.774 --> 17:35.708
And since Mr. Masters
is incredibly loyal

17:35.776 --> 17:37.676
to his friends,
no matter how undeserving,

17:37.745 --> 17:40.612
a character trait for which
you must be daily grateful,

17:40.681 --> 17:42.774
I can't order him
off the premises.

17:42.850 --> 17:45.512
It sounds like you want to
make some sort of a deal.

17:45.819 --> 17:48.413
A deal?
I beg your pardon.

17:48.756 --> 17:51.782
Hire me to protect the place
from destruction.

17:51.892 --> 17:52.984
Or worse.

17:53.060 --> 17:54.687
I was under the...

17:57.765 --> 17:59.426
I was under the delusion

17:59.500 --> 18:01.229
that either
out of loyalty to Robin

18:01.302 --> 18:04.635
or in your alleged capacity
as a security consultant...

18:04.705 --> 18:07.731
That's right.
So I'll make it easy on you. No money.

18:07.808 --> 18:09.742
Instead, for three months,

18:09.810 --> 18:11.971
the swimming pool,
the billiard room,

18:12.046 --> 18:14.844
the new big-screen TV
moved into the guest house,

18:14.915 --> 18:17.315
and free access
to the wine cellar.

18:20.387 --> 18:21.513
One month,

18:21.622 --> 18:24.455
but the billiard room
and wine cellar are excluded.

18:27.661 --> 18:29.561
Two months.
And that's my final...

18:52.019 --> 18:54.681
<i>I have my own high standards</i>
<i>as a private investigator,</i>

18:54.755 --> 18:57.019
<i>and there are some cases</i>
<i>I just won't take.</i>

18:57.091 --> 18:59.286
<i>Baby-sitting's one of them.</i>

18:59.360 --> 19:00.554
<i>On the other hand,</i>

19:00.627 --> 19:02.094
<i>this was one of</i>
<i>those rare moments</i>

19:02.162 --> 19:03.857
<i>when I didn't</i>
<i>have an assignment,</i>

19:03.931 --> 19:06.900
<i>and if Joan wanted to pay me</i>
<i>for hanging out with Buck,</i>

19:06.967 --> 19:08.730
<i>and if Higgins</i>
<i>wanted to give me</i>

19:08.802 --> 19:10.030
<i>half the estate, I figured,</i>

19:10.104 --> 19:12.197
<i>what's a couple of beers</i>
<i>with a friend?</i>

19:12.339 --> 19:14.466
<i>I mean, what could go wrong</i>
<i>having a few beers?</i>

19:14.541 --> 19:16.008
<i>Nothing, right?</i>

19:19.046 --> 19:21.014
Good night.
Good night.

19:25.486 --> 19:26.714
Mad Buck!

19:26.787 --> 19:28.550
Over here!

19:28.622 --> 19:30.920
You crazy
son of a "B"...

19:31.692 --> 19:33.353
How are you doing?

19:33.427 --> 19:34.917
What are you guys
doing here?

19:34.995 --> 19:36.622
When he heard
Mad Buck was here,

19:36.697 --> 19:37.721
I couldn't stop him.

19:37.798 --> 19:39.197
Mad Buck.

19:39.266 --> 19:40.858
You know Rick
and this is T.C.

19:40.934 --> 19:42.333
He's an associate of mine.

19:42.469 --> 19:43.902
How you doing?
Hi, there.

19:50.878 --> 19:53.005
I know you get
tired of hearing this,

19:53.080 --> 19:55.173
but I've read
all of your books.

19:55.249 --> 19:57.046
No, come on.
Not all.

19:57.117 --> 19:58.311
All 27.

19:58.385 --> 20:01.183
My favorite is
<i>Curse of the Aztec Goddess.</i>

20:01.588 --> 20:04.455
I mean you're sort of
an inspiration to me

20:04.525 --> 20:06.857
because I'm sort of working on
something of my own.

20:06.927 --> 20:09.521
Maybe when I finish a chapter,
you would read it?

20:09.596 --> 20:11.291
Oh, yeah,
you got it, B.C.

20:11.365 --> 20:12.423
T.C.

20:12.499 --> 20:14.694
What are you
drinking tonight?

20:14.768 --> 20:18.704
Bazookas all around.
Double.

20:19.807 --> 20:20.865
Uh, beer.

20:21.909 --> 20:23.274
War injury.

20:28.816 --> 20:30.943
Yeah, yeah, so anyway,
my next favorite one

20:31.018 --> 20:32.315
was <i>Dagger of the Scorpion.</i>

20:32.386 --> 20:34.980
That's where the guy gets
the girl in the bathtub...

20:35.055 --> 20:36.352
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:36.423 --> 20:37.913
Then she gives him
the Mickey.

20:37.991 --> 20:38.980
Hey, Buck,

20:39.059 --> 20:41.084
can you really make
a Mickey out of aspirin,

20:41.161 --> 20:43.026
baking soda,
and aftershave lotion?

20:43.130 --> 20:47.066
Pal, you give me
a medicine cabinet,

20:47.568 --> 20:50.264
and I can make
a Mickey out of anything.

20:52.272 --> 20:54.365
Well, well, what a surprise,
meeting you here.

20:54.441 --> 20:56.068
Don't get up.
Don't get up.

20:56.143 --> 20:57.542
What are you
doing here?

20:57.611 --> 20:58.578
Hello.

20:58.645 --> 21:00.738
Jim! Who let this
tarantula in?

21:00.814 --> 21:03.681
You're looking well
and just as charming as ever.

21:03.750 --> 21:04.910
Well, let me see.

21:04.985 --> 21:06.543
I think I've met
all your friends

21:06.620 --> 21:08.315
except for this
handsome devil.

21:08.388 --> 21:09.582
Hello, I'm Joan.

21:09.656 --> 21:12.682
Better known in some circles
as Mrs. Gibson I.

21:12.759 --> 21:14.317
I wanna find
a joint where the rats

21:14.394 --> 21:15.918
don't drink
with the customers.

21:15.996 --> 21:18.294
Is that a line from
<i>Kitten with a Bloody.45?</i>

21:18.365 --> 21:19.730
Magnum, order me a Scotch.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.028
Magnum?

21:21.101 --> 21:22.830
Are you friends
with this witch?

21:22.903 --> 21:24.336
W- we've been introduced.

21:24.404 --> 21:26.599
Actually, we're
practically going steady.

21:26.673 --> 21:29.005
Buck loves to be titillated.

21:29.076 --> 21:30.566
Oh, and speaking of that,

21:30.644 --> 21:33.169
I have something here
that will just

21:34.047 --> 21:36.072
make you so happy.

21:36.216 --> 21:38.275
Here, would you pass this
to Mr. Gibson?

21:38.352 --> 21:40.684
It's that court order you've
been waiting for, love.

21:40.754 --> 21:42.085
Stuff it back
in your purse.

21:42.155 --> 21:43.417
I'm not touching it.

21:43.490 --> 21:44.957
Drop it in his lap, T.C.

21:45.025 --> 21:48.051
He doesn't have to besmirch
his artistic paws.

21:54.902 --> 21:56.369
Thanks, T.C.

21:56.436 --> 21:57.767
Never let it be
said that

21:57.838 --> 21:59.601
Buck ever put
a pal on the spot.

21:59.673 --> 22:01.868
Here, take this
back to your attorney

22:01.942 --> 22:05.105
and shove it in
his flat briefcase.

22:05.345 --> 22:08.337
Oh, still the insatiable
intellectual curiosity

22:08.415 --> 22:10.747
I fell in love with
20 years ago.

22:11.184 --> 22:12.776
Well, ever mind, snuggles.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.548
I've got
a trunk full of these

22:14.621 --> 22:16.953
and a telephone book
full of process servers

22:17.024 --> 22:18.616
waiting to deliver them.

22:18.692 --> 22:20.489
I'm gonna wipe you out.

22:20.561 --> 22:22.893
I'm gonna drop
your cantaloupe

22:23.430 --> 22:25.330
and furl your sail.

22:25.566 --> 22:27.193
You know, 20 years ago,

22:27.267 --> 22:29.235
Buck Gibson didn't know
what a metaphor was.

22:29.303 --> 22:31.100
Now he's mixing them.

22:31.171 --> 22:33.036
Ah! Please don't beg me
to stay.

22:33.106 --> 22:34.903
I have to go
share this with the worid.

22:34.975 --> 22:35.942
Put it in

22:36.009 --> 22:38.068
that antsy-pantsy
intellectual column you write.

22:38.145 --> 22:41.740
It'll be the best-kept secret
in the Western Hemisphere!

22:43.083 --> 22:44.675
What are you lookin' at?

22:44.751 --> 22:46.309
You, loudmouth.

22:46.386 --> 22:47.910
You listen, lard-gut,

22:47.988 --> 22:49.649
I'd like a few
words with you.

22:49.723 --> 22:51.315
Hey, Buck, Buck,
just a second.

22:51.391 --> 22:53.359
No, no, it's too late
for him to apologize.

22:53.427 --> 22:54.758
Buck, no, no!
Come on.

22:54.828 --> 22:55.988
Will you just
stop it?

22:56.063 --> 22:57.223
He doesn't...

23:18.385 --> 23:20.615
I think I broke my hand.

23:23.857 --> 23:26.985
"The young weapons specialist,
considered by many

23:27.060 --> 23:29.790
"to be the handsomest
American in Saigon,

23:30.263 --> 23:31.787
"stepped from the shower,

23:31.865 --> 23:34.163
"water beading from
his perfect body.

23:34.501 --> 23:37.595
He smiled at the three
eager B-giris and..."

23:37.671 --> 23:40.003
Hey, Rick.
How you doing?

23:40.073 --> 23:41.165
Terrific.
Hi, guys.

23:41.241 --> 23:43.072
Just, uh, doing some
notes for the club.

23:43.176 --> 23:44.200
That's a lie.

23:44.277 --> 23:46.575
You're writing
a book about Nam.

23:47.681 --> 23:49.706
<i>Saigon Sex Machine?</i>

23:49.783 --> 23:50.715
Yeah.

23:50.784 --> 23:52.274
Buck makes
a $100,000 a year

23:52.352 --> 23:54.149
writing this stuff
and I can do it easy.

23:54.221 --> 23:56.086
You write a story
about Nam,

23:56.156 --> 23:58.021
and I'll have my lawyers
in here tomorrow.

23:58.091 --> 23:59.319
You ain't got a lawyer.

23:59.393 --> 24:00.382
I'll get one.

24:00.460 --> 24:01.927
"...stepped
from the shower,

24:01.995 --> 24:03.826
"water beading
from his perfect body.

24:03.897 --> 24:06.161
He smiled at
the three eager B-giris..."

24:08.001 --> 24:10.799
<i>Nurse Chen,</i>
<i>please check in at Station 4.</i>

24:11.104 --> 24:13.766
Oh, you look
a little downhearted, boy.

24:14.174 --> 24:16.142
I got just
the cure for you.

24:16.209 --> 24:19.406
Come join me on my...
on my newest adventure.

24:19.479 --> 24:21.640
Hang-gliding
to Molokai.

24:21.715 --> 24:23.012
What?
Yeah.

24:23.083 --> 24:24.380
Do you know
how far that is?

24:24.451 --> 24:25.418
28 miles.

24:25.485 --> 24:27.749
Across one of the roughest
channels in the worid?

24:27.821 --> 24:29.880
You got a broken hand, Buck,
you got a broken foot.

24:29.956 --> 24:32.652
A few cracked fossils
aren't gonna stop Buck Gibson.

24:32.726 --> 24:34.660
Come on. Let's have
some fun. Live a little.

24:34.728 --> 24:36.320
You know,
that's the trouble with you.

24:36.396 --> 24:37.761
Nothing stops Mad Buck.

24:37.831 --> 24:40.994
I got a friend in here with his
jaw wired shut because of you.

24:41.068 --> 24:42.831
And another guy
who's ready to kill him

24:42.903 --> 24:43.927
for the same reason.

24:44.004 --> 24:47.371
Well, fans. Aficionados.
It's the price of glory.

24:47.441 --> 24:48.533
Buck.

24:50.410 --> 24:51.934
No more stunts.

24:54.748 --> 24:57.581
Or what, pal?

25:02.856 --> 25:04.721
Do you know
anything about baseball?

25:05.292 --> 25:06.850
Yeah, a little.

25:06.927 --> 25:09.157
Sandy Koufax used to
be a personal friend.

25:09.262 --> 25:10.752
I tried to teach
him how to throw...

25:10.831 --> 25:12.298
Ah, yeah. Buck.

25:12.432 --> 25:14.832
Well, see, I wanted to throw
like Sandy, too.

25:15.068 --> 25:17.002
As a matter of fact,
I was pretty good.

25:17.070 --> 25:19.061
I made starting pitcher
on our baseball team.

25:19.139 --> 25:20.367
That was a big deal

25:20.440 --> 25:22.374
because we'd been
state champs for two years.

25:22.442 --> 25:23.409
Uh-huh.

25:23.477 --> 25:24.739
Yeah, I was pretty tough.

25:24.811 --> 25:25.903
Threw real hard,

25:25.979 --> 25:27.378
and my fastball
moved real good.

25:27.447 --> 25:31.247
I had a curve ball so sweet

25:31.384 --> 25:33.147
it would break your heart.

25:33.487 --> 25:34.954
So, you know what?

25:35.122 --> 25:38.216
Every day after practice,
I just expected this

25:38.291 --> 25:42.022
big-league scout to be waiting
with Sandy Koufax's uniform.

25:43.063 --> 25:44.052
Yeah.

25:44.197 --> 25:45.494
I know what you mean.

25:45.632 --> 25:46.929
No, you don't.

25:48.468 --> 25:50.060
No, you don't, Buck,

25:50.137 --> 25:51.968
because the scout
never came.

25:52.606 --> 25:55.302
See, there was this
other guy on the team,

25:55.375 --> 25:57.036
and he practiced
just as hard.

25:57.210 --> 25:59.371
And it came time
for the state championship.

25:59.446 --> 26:01.744
The coach
started the other kid.

26:02.182 --> 26:03.774
And I took it
pretty hard.

26:03.850 --> 26:04.942
Yeah.

26:05.652 --> 26:07.745
Actually,
worse than pretty hard.

26:07.821 --> 26:09.686
But I'll tell you
something.

26:10.123 --> 26:11.351
My dad

26:13.693 --> 26:15.422
did me a big favor.

26:15.595 --> 26:17.961
Made me really
understand something.

26:18.031 --> 26:19.896
About trying harder

26:19.966 --> 26:22.093
or "Not everybody
can be a winner"?

26:22.169 --> 26:23.568
No. Not that.

26:25.672 --> 26:29.768
He said, uh, "Athletics
only last a summer,

26:30.944 --> 26:33.105
however long
that summer is."

26:36.082 --> 26:37.572
Meaning what?

26:37.651 --> 26:39.744
That physical ability
is important,

26:40.187 --> 26:42.655
but you can't define
your life that way

26:42.722 --> 26:44.417
because it doesn't last

26:44.491 --> 26:46.186
and life goes on.

26:48.895 --> 26:51.125
So all I'm trying
to say, Buck,

26:52.032 --> 26:54.500
is you can be
exactly what you are.

26:55.335 --> 26:56.495
You don't have

26:56.570 --> 26:59.004
to keep pulling
these crazy stunts.

26:59.706 --> 27:02.231
That's where
you're wrong, buddy boy.

27:03.310 --> 27:04.436
I do.

27:17.424 --> 27:19.858
Excuse me, are you
a friend of Mr. Gibson's?

27:19.926 --> 27:22.759
Not exactly. Uh, yes.

27:23.463 --> 27:25.055
I'm the ER resident.

27:25.131 --> 27:28.362
I wanted to ask you a couple of
questions about his medical history.

27:28.435 --> 27:29.800
Excuse me, Doctor.

27:29.870 --> 27:31.735
Shouldn't you be
getting that from him?

27:31.805 --> 27:33.602
Believe me, I tried.

27:33.673 --> 27:35.504
Mr. Gibson doesn't seem
to have much regard

27:35.575 --> 27:36.769
for doctors.

27:37.344 --> 27:39.938
If you have any
influence with him,

27:40.013 --> 27:42.311
urge him to go in
for a complete physical.

27:42.716 --> 27:44.047
Is something wrong?

27:44.117 --> 27:45.948
Other than his fractures?

27:46.152 --> 27:47.676
That's just it.

27:47.787 --> 27:50.688
Sometimes almost
spontaneous fractures

27:50.757 --> 27:52.816
like these can
be indicative of

27:52.893 --> 27:54.793
a more serious disease.

27:56.162 --> 27:57.823
Doctor,
there's nothing spontaneous

27:57.898 --> 27:58.922
about his fractures.

27:58.999 --> 28:01.092
First, parachuting in
on the beach.

28:01.167 --> 28:03.431
And then the guy in the bar
must have weighed...

28:03.503 --> 28:06.063
300 pounds, easy,
and a fist like King Kong.

28:06.139 --> 28:08.334
Yeah, Buck did let
a few details slip.

28:08.842 --> 28:10.309
Only thing,

28:10.443 --> 28:12.411
there was
absolutely no trauma

28:12.479 --> 28:14.743
to the foot
and none to the hand.

28:15.048 --> 28:17.016
I can find no relation
whatever between

28:17.083 --> 28:20.177
these fractures
and Mr. Gibson's stunts.

28:28.326 --> 28:30.624
<i>There was a lull</i>
<i>in the Buck Gibson storm.</i>

28:30.695 --> 28:32.925
<i>And I was going to</i>
<i>take advantage of it.</i>

28:32.998 --> 28:36.092
<i>The doctor had started</i>
<i>my little voice talking.</i>

28:36.168 --> 28:38.728
<i>And I didn't like</i>
<i>what it was saying.</i>

28:38.804 --> 28:40.362
<i>Now, I make it a rule of honor</i>

28:40.439 --> 28:42.805
<i>to always respect</i>
<i>another man's privacy.</i>

28:43.108 --> 28:45.975
<i>But, after all,</i>
<i>it was still my bathroom.</i>

29:00.992 --> 29:02.289
Uh, Jimmy.

29:02.661 --> 29:05.061
Jimmy never would
give me his recipe.

29:05.130 --> 29:06.062
But I think

29:06.131 --> 29:08.599
I got his old Bazooka
all figured out.

29:09.267 --> 29:12.031
Two kinds of rum.
Dark rum, light rum,

29:12.237 --> 29:15.297
uh, guava
and creme de menthe.

29:16.808 --> 29:18.366
What do you think,
huh?

29:19.110 --> 29:21.135
Yeah, well, it smells
close enough, all right.

29:22.247 --> 29:24.977
Uh, say, Buck, you will tell me
the truth on this, won't you?

29:25.050 --> 29:26.039
Ooh, absolutely.

29:26.117 --> 29:28.779
Brutally honest, old man,
brutally honest.

29:28.854 --> 29:29.878
Now let's see.

29:29.955 --> 29:32.287
"He stepped from
the shower,

29:32.657 --> 29:34.420
"black and chiseled.

29:35.026 --> 29:37.722
"The enveloping steam
was like smoke.

29:37.796 --> 29:40.356
Otis was ready
for the night."

29:44.169 --> 29:45.796
It needs ouzo.

29:46.771 --> 29:47.897
Ouzo?

29:48.106 --> 29:49.937
Yeah, yeah,
lacks character.

29:50.008 --> 29:50.997
Otis?

29:51.076 --> 29:52.168
Otis?

29:52.911 --> 29:56.176
Otis! Oh, no,
I like it, I like it so far.

29:56.248 --> 29:58.739
It's... it's got,
uh, guts.

30:00.018 --> 30:01.110
Yeah, guts.

30:01.186 --> 30:03.552
Oh, wait till you get
to the tattoo scene.

30:03.622 --> 30:05.590
I got
plenty of guts there.

30:07.392 --> 30:09.326
Yeah, I can hardly wait.

30:11.596 --> 30:12.824
Now, listen.

30:13.298 --> 30:15.493
Uh, T.C., I really want
to do this justice.

30:15.567 --> 30:17.535
But l... I think I can
give it a better read

30:17.602 --> 30:19.331
if I'm all by myself.

30:20.472 --> 30:22.770
Yeah, sure. I don't want to
mess with your concentration.

30:22.841 --> 30:25.036
A- alone,
you know what I mean?

30:25.544 --> 30:27.535
Oh, yeah,
sure, sure.

30:27.612 --> 30:28.704
You don't mind,
do you?

30:28.780 --> 30:29.906
Oh, no. No.

30:29.981 --> 30:31.243
Wanna take
your drink with you?

30:31.316 --> 30:34.479
Uh, no, I don't like
to drink and drive, you know.

30:35.487 --> 30:36.476
Yeah.

30:56.041 --> 30:57.872
Magnificent, isn't it?

30:59.945 --> 31:01.572
You talking
about the scenery

31:01.880 --> 31:03.279
or about Buck?

31:03.348 --> 31:04.747
Why, Mr. Magnum,

31:04.816 --> 31:07.216
I didn't know you were
a man who liked riddles.

31:07.285 --> 31:10.152
Well, I don't very much.
I prefer straight talk.

31:10.221 --> 31:11.848
Straight answers.

31:12.524 --> 31:15.015
Sounds like you, uh,
have some questions.

31:15.093 --> 31:16.458
Yes, I do.

31:17.095 --> 31:19.563
Starting with
the pills Buck takes,

31:19.631 --> 31:22.429
and the bones that were
broken for no reason,

31:22.500 --> 31:24.525
and Dr. Murphy
in New York.

31:24.769 --> 31:26.532
You talked to
Dr. Murphy?

31:26.605 --> 31:27.936
How did you
know about...

31:28.006 --> 31:29.200
Prescription bottle.

31:29.274 --> 31:30.935
But he wouldn't
tell me anything.

31:31.009 --> 31:33.307
A patient's records
are confidential.

31:33.378 --> 31:35.642
But his voice
sure told me something.

31:37.282 --> 31:39.443
You know, Magnum,
I thought I was hiring a bodyguard,

31:39.517 --> 31:41.144
not a detective.

31:41.920 --> 31:43.217
How bad is it, Joan?

31:43.288 --> 31:44.915
Probably nothing
at all.

31:44.990 --> 31:45.979
Or?

31:46.057 --> 31:47.786
Look.

31:48.259 --> 31:49.817
Buck has had
a calcium problem

31:49.894 --> 31:51.156
since he was
20 years old.

31:51.229 --> 31:53.459
If he doesn't
take his pills...

31:53.732 --> 31:56.565
Why does everyone
automatically jump...

32:07.545 --> 32:10.571
They ran a complete
battery of tests on him

32:10.649 --> 32:12.412
72 hours ago in New York.

32:14.686 --> 32:17.154
We should know
something by today.

32:18.323 --> 32:21.053
But will Buck
hang around New York?

32:21.126 --> 32:23.959
No. He has to fly off
here on an adventure.

32:25.730 --> 32:28.824
Dr. Murphy was good enough
to tell me about it.

32:29.868 --> 32:31.631
So you made up
the whole story

32:31.703 --> 32:33.170
about the alimony
so I'd stop him...

32:33.238 --> 32:35.968
To keep him from
making a fool of himself.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.100
And I wish I could think
of one good reason

32:38.176 --> 32:39.473
why I'm bothering.

32:39.544 --> 32:41.603
Now if you come up with
something preposterous

32:41.680 --> 32:43.204
like I still care
about him,

32:43.281 --> 32:45.340
or what he's doing
or how...

32:47.986 --> 32:50.216
God, I wish
I had a cigarette.

32:54.192 --> 32:55.386
Oh, no.

32:55.460 --> 32:57.485
Stop! Stop this instant!

32:57.562 --> 32:58.756
Relax, Higgins,

32:58.830 --> 33:00.661
you got to blow it
all once in a while.

33:00.732 --> 33:02.393
I forbid you to...

33:04.002 --> 33:05.629
You were
supposed to protect...

33:05.704 --> 33:07.365
Higgins, give me
the keys to the Audi.

33:07.439 --> 33:08.770
If anything
happens to that car...

33:08.840 --> 33:10.137
Come on,
I'm losing time.

33:45.443 --> 33:46.774
You idiot!

33:48.413 --> 33:49.641
Come on.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.217
You wanna race?

33:57.288 --> 33:58.880
Buck, pull over.

33:59.090 --> 34:00.352
I'll spot you points.

34:00.425 --> 34:01.653
Pull over.

34:01.726 --> 34:03.284
Meet you back at the club.

34:21.411 --> 34:24.040
<i>I was looking at several</i>
<i>very grim possibilities</i>

34:24.114 --> 34:26.049
<i>involving</i>
<i>the destruction of Buck,</i>

34:26.117 --> 34:27.982
<i>the Ferrari,</i>
<i>innocent bystanders,</i>

34:28.052 --> 34:29.849
<i>or any combination thereof.</i>

34:34.492 --> 34:36.619
<i>There were much fewer</i>
<i>good possibilities</i>

34:36.694 --> 34:39.185
<i>and they didn't come</i>
<i>readily to mind.</i>

34:43.902 --> 34:45.199
Look out!

35:02.554 --> 35:04.112
I'm out of the race.

35:04.189 --> 35:05.417
Get out
of the car.

35:05.490 --> 35:06.684
It was those goats.

35:06.758 --> 35:09.226
Why do I always
brake for animals?

35:09.294 --> 35:10.921
Get out
of the car!

35:10.995 --> 35:12.292
All right, all right,

35:12.363 --> 35:14.092
what's... what's the matter
with you, boy?

35:14.165 --> 35:15.996
You take
a risk like that.

35:16.067 --> 35:17.295
This is my skin.

35:17.368 --> 35:18.562
And Robin's car.

35:18.636 --> 35:19.762
He can buy
another one.

35:19.838 --> 35:20.930
He can afford it,
so can I.

35:21.005 --> 35:22.996
And what about those people
you almost killed,

35:23.074 --> 35:24.098
can they buy
another life?

35:24.175 --> 35:26.666
Magnum, old boy,
nobody was hurt.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.146
By some
incredible stroke of luck!

35:29.214 --> 35:30.977
Look, Buck, if you
want to kill yourself,

35:31.049 --> 35:32.676
leave the rest
of the worid out of it.

35:32.750 --> 35:34.718
We'd like to live
a few more years.

35:38.122 --> 35:39.111
Yeah.

35:40.325 --> 35:42.350
Buck, I know
all about it.

35:44.229 --> 35:46.823
Joan says that the doctor
thinks the odds are

35:46.898 --> 35:48.422
it's just your
calcium deficiency.

35:48.499 --> 35:50.023
Calcium deficiency?

35:51.936 --> 35:53.665
Oh, Magnum.

35:54.105 --> 35:55.299
Magnum, old boy,

35:55.373 --> 35:57.341
don't you have
any sensibilities?

35:57.775 --> 35:59.800
I'm a gambler.
Well, I'm a writer.

35:59.878 --> 36:01.641
All writers
are gamblers.

36:04.182 --> 36:06.082
I'm a carefree,
happy-go-lucky,

36:06.751 --> 36:08.412
adventuresome...

36:10.088 --> 36:11.419
You know...

36:11.656 --> 36:14.181
You see, l... I have...
I have got to have

36:14.259 --> 36:16.022
some fatal disease.

36:16.828 --> 36:17.988
It's poetic.

36:18.062 --> 36:19.154
Yeah.

36:23.268 --> 36:25.862
Oh, boy, I'm tired.
Bone-tired.

36:25.937 --> 36:28.132
Like I've never
been tired before.

36:32.043 --> 36:34.671
I don't want to take
that call from Murphy.

36:34.746 --> 36:37.306
I don't want to know
the results of the tests.

36:39.150 --> 36:40.845
Come on, you got me
talking maudlin.

36:40.919 --> 36:43.114
I hate that.
Take me home, will you?

36:44.789 --> 36:48.555
Well, if I have to wait for
that call with... with anybody,

36:49.127 --> 36:50.958
it might as well be you.

36:53.731 --> 36:55.824
"His massive biceps bulging,

36:55.900 --> 36:58.027
"his muscular chest
covered with sweat,

36:58.102 --> 37:00.002
"Otis pulled Lotus
Blossom's willing,

37:00.071 --> 37:02.198
"heaving body
into the chopper.

37:02.273 --> 37:04.537
"As she covered his face
with desperate kisses,

37:04.609 --> 37:05.735
"he fired his engine

37:05.810 --> 37:08.836
determined to rescue the man
who had sworn to kill him."

37:09.113 --> 37:12.207
Well, the plot is thin,
but it really isn't bad.

37:12.850 --> 37:14.010
Coffee?

37:14.152 --> 37:16.017
Uh, yeah, sure. Why not?

37:24.228 --> 37:26.128
Answer that, will you?

37:31.235 --> 37:33.760
Hello.
Yeah, just a second.

37:36.808 --> 37:37.900
T.C.

37:37.976 --> 37:38.965
Oh.

37:44.048 --> 37:45.982
Hiya, T.C.
How you doin'?

37:46.884 --> 37:50.479
Yeah, yeah. No, no,
I haven't finished it yet.

37:50.555 --> 37:52.045
But so far, so good.

37:52.957 --> 37:55.152
Yeah, I'll let you know
just as soon as I do.

37:55.293 --> 37:57.989
Oh, you're... you're
very welcome. Goodbye.

38:02.433 --> 38:05.095
"Otis could feel
Lotus Blossom's kiss.

38:05.169 --> 38:07.069
It seemed to
cling to his lips."

38:14.712 --> 38:16.612
That's it. I've had it.

38:16.681 --> 38:18.740
I'm going down to the Aloha.
I need a Bazooka.

38:18.816 --> 38:19.840
Come on, Buck.

38:19.917 --> 38:21.475
Take a message.

38:23.087 --> 38:25.555
Hello. Yeah.
Just a second.

38:26.024 --> 38:27.514
It's New York.

38:29.761 --> 38:31.319
It's Dr. Murphy.

38:55.186 --> 38:56.414
Hiya, Murph.
How you doing?

38:56.487 --> 38:58.216
How's things
in the Big Apple?

38:59.090 --> 39:01.251
Yeah, sure,
I'm sitting down. Why?

39:02.994 --> 39:04.689
No kiddin'.

39:05.596 --> 39:07.029
You're kidding!

39:08.533 --> 39:09.795
That's marvelous.

39:09.867 --> 39:12.233
Thank you, thank you, Murph.
Yeah, thank you very much.

39:12.303 --> 39:14.168
I'll see you. Goodbye.

39:15.540 --> 39:17.974
I don't believe it.
It's too corny.

39:18.376 --> 39:19.468
What?

39:20.978 --> 39:23.572
I really do
have bone cancer.

39:25.049 --> 39:26.846
I'm really gonna die.

39:38.895 --> 39:41.022
<i>Buck didn't seem</i>
<i>as shaken by the news</i>

39:41.098 --> 39:42.326
<i>as you'd expect.</i>

39:42.399 --> 39:44.162
<i>That made me suspicious.</i>

39:44.234 --> 39:47.362
<i>Unfortunately, it didn't make</i>
<i>me suspicious enough.</i>

39:47.437 --> 39:48.961
<i>That evening</i>
<i>we had a few drinks,</i>

39:49.039 --> 39:51.166
<i>and Buck put</i>
<i>a little surprise in mine.</i>

39:51.575 --> 39:54.066
<i>He proved a Mickey Finn</i>
<i>really could be made</i>

39:54.144 --> 39:56.544
<i>from what was</i>
<i>in a medicine cabinet.</i>

39:57.214 --> 39:59.307
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>how long he'd been gone.</i>

39:59.449 --> 40:01.576
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>what he was up to.</i>

40:01.818 --> 40:04.480
<i>All I had was</i>
<i>the worst headache of my life.</i>

40:07.657 --> 40:09.215
Magnum!

40:11.361 --> 40:12.521
Come in.

40:17.934 --> 40:20.198
I spoke to Dr. Murphy.
You knew.

40:20.470 --> 40:22.233
You found out
yesterday?

40:22.372 --> 40:24.135
Why didn't you
tell me?

40:24.207 --> 40:25.640
He made me
promise I wouldn't.

40:25.709 --> 40:26.676
So what?

40:26.743 --> 40:28.108
Look, Joan,
it's his life.

40:28.178 --> 40:29.509
I hired you.

40:29.579 --> 40:30.841
Yeah, to protect him.

40:30.914 --> 40:32.745
And that's what I did,
or at least I tried.

40:32.816 --> 40:35.512
Well, not good enough.
Not good enough at all.

40:35.585 --> 40:36.711
Now, where is he?

40:36.786 --> 40:37.980
I don't know.

40:38.054 --> 40:39.487
"Sorry for the grief, pal.

40:39.556 --> 40:40.784
"I'm taking off for Asgard.

40:40.857 --> 40:42.950
Tell Joan she's a brick.
Buck."

40:43.026 --> 40:44.288
Oh, the vanity...

40:44.361 --> 40:45.385
Where is Asgard?

40:45.462 --> 40:47.555
Not "where,"
Magnum, "what."

40:48.098 --> 40:50.794
Asgard
is Norse mythology,

40:50.867 --> 40:53.062
it's the home
of slain heroes.

40:53.403 --> 40:56.429
Now we've got to find him
before it's too late.

40:56.506 --> 40:58.064
Joan, he could be anywhere.

40:58.141 --> 40:59.631
But there's
a treatment.

40:59.709 --> 41:03.042
Dr. Murphy said he could...
he could have a remission.

41:04.548 --> 41:05.708
Please, Magnum,

41:05.782 --> 41:08.012
we can't just let him
write himself off.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.519
I know that.

41:22.465 --> 41:23.659
Higgins.

41:23.733 --> 41:25.030
Oh, Magnum.

41:25.802 --> 41:27.429
Glorious morning, eh?

41:27.504 --> 41:28.528
Have you seen
Buck?

41:28.605 --> 41:31.836
Obviously. Why else would I
characterize the morning as glorious?

41:31.908 --> 41:32.932
What do you mean?

41:33.009 --> 41:34.169
Don't you feel it,
Magnum?

41:34.244 --> 41:36.212
The comforting void
of Buck's absence.

41:36.279 --> 41:37.871
Did he say anything?

41:37.948 --> 41:39.006
My, you're grim today.

41:39.082 --> 41:40.879
Has he broken
one of your few possessions?

41:40.951 --> 41:42.816
Did he say anything,
Higgins?

41:42.886 --> 41:44.786
Yes.
And quite out of character.

41:44.854 --> 41:47.721
He apologized for any
inconvenience he might have caused

41:47.791 --> 41:49.782
and left a blank check
to cover damages.

41:49.859 --> 41:51.053
Gave me the impression

41:51.127 --> 41:53.061
he would be gone
for some time.

41:53.597 --> 41:55.087
Is something wrong?

41:55.165 --> 41:56.962
You have any idea
where he was going?

41:57.033 --> 41:58.796
That, I'm afraid,
is between Buck

41:58.868 --> 42:00.392
and the cabby
who called for him.

42:01.871 --> 42:03.839
Magnum, what's going on?

42:11.214 --> 42:13.079
<i>If Buck was saying goodbye,</i>

42:13.149 --> 42:16.243
<i>I knew one place in Honolulu</i>
<i>he'd be sure to go.</i>

42:16.386 --> 42:18.650
<i>I just hoped</i>
<i>I wasn't too late.</i>

42:30.400 --> 42:31.765
Excuse me.

42:31.835 --> 42:34.065
Oh, it's
the beer drinker.

42:34.137 --> 42:35.695
Is Buck around?

42:37.240 --> 42:38.901
Look,
it's important.

42:38.975 --> 42:42.069
What a man does,
where he goes,

42:42.145 --> 42:44.841
that's his business,
not mine.

42:45.515 --> 42:47.915
I'm not a cop.
I'm not a process server.

42:47.984 --> 42:49.815
I'm a friend of his.

42:51.421 --> 42:53.321
I never met
a friend of Buck's

42:53.390 --> 42:55.620
who didn't drink a Bazooka.

42:58.028 --> 43:00.155
I'm trying to save his life!

43:13.243 --> 43:16.303
He was in here.
But he's gone.

43:16.379 --> 43:17.607
What did he say?

43:17.681 --> 43:21.173
Nothing much.
Just "aloha."

43:22.185 --> 43:23.948
And something about

43:24.020 --> 43:26.352
a new worid's
record hand-gliding.

43:27.891 --> 43:29.085
Molokai.

43:57.420 --> 43:58.751
Well, Magnum, I see

43:58.822 --> 44:00.949
you made it up in time
to see me off.

44:01.024 --> 44:02.150
How's your head?

44:04.594 --> 44:06.562
Ah, what a glorious
morning for flying.

44:06.629 --> 44:07.789
Look at Molokai out there.

44:07.864 --> 44:09.627
So close,
I almost think

44:09.699 --> 44:11.462
I'm tempted to do it
without wings.

44:11.534 --> 44:13.161
Buck, just stop it.
Just cut it out.

44:13.236 --> 44:14.498
What are you sayin'?

44:14.571 --> 44:16.596
I'm sayin'...
You know what I'm sayin'.

44:16.673 --> 44:17.799
I'm not gonna
let you do it.

44:17.874 --> 44:18.966
Now let's
get out of here.

44:19.042 --> 44:20.168
No way.

44:20.243 --> 44:21.767
I like the odds here

44:21.845 --> 44:23.335
a lot better than
in New York.

44:23.413 --> 44:26.678
There aren't any odds here,
Buck, and you know it.

44:26.750 --> 44:28.445
Come on, Buck,
you've got a chance.

44:28.518 --> 44:29.542
The doctor says...

44:29.619 --> 44:31.917
Doctor! That's no doctor.
That man is...

44:31.988 --> 44:36.118
No, no. He's gonna cut me up.
I'll die in little pieces.

44:36.626 --> 44:38.890
And what's the alternative,
Buck? Suicide?

44:38.962 --> 44:41.453
Come on, you're not a quitter.
You're a fighter.

44:41.531 --> 44:43.021
At least I always thought so.

44:43.099 --> 44:45.226
And so did a lot of
your readers, like T.C.

44:45.301 --> 44:46.893
They respect
the way you live.

44:46.970 --> 44:48.995
Well, then, for God's sake,

44:49.072 --> 44:50.767
let them respect
the way I'm gonna die.

44:50.840 --> 44:51.807
Come on.

44:51.875 --> 44:54.435
Is this the way it's going
to end up with you and me?

44:54.511 --> 44:56.240
Wrassling around
here in the dirt

44:56.312 --> 44:58.041
before you drag me
down to your car?

44:58.114 --> 44:59.445
Pal, come on.

44:59.949 --> 45:01.746
Don't do this to me.

45:01.818 --> 45:03.945
Well, then I won't do it
to you.

45:04.020 --> 45:05.647
I'll tell it to
that little kid

45:05.722 --> 45:08.452
who had a curve ball that
would break your heart.

45:09.058 --> 45:11.856
And who ached for
Sandy Koufax's uniform.

45:11.928 --> 45:14.590
You see, because I had
a fantasy, too, once.

45:15.165 --> 45:16.325
Never,

45:16.499 --> 45:20.128
never, ever, was I
gonna be afraid of death.

45:20.637 --> 45:21.626
What?

45:21.738 --> 45:23.365
Oh, yeah, always.

45:24.007 --> 45:26.100
Always hated myself for it.

45:27.377 --> 45:28.639
Yeah, I always...

45:28.878 --> 45:30.709
I always ran just a little

45:30.780 --> 45:32.543
too far out
in front of the bulls

45:32.615 --> 45:34.378
when we ran
with them in Spain.

45:34.517 --> 45:38.749
I always pulled the ripcord
just one instant too soon.

45:40.924 --> 45:43.119
I was always afraid of dying.

45:44.194 --> 45:46.492
But now Death
has screwed up.

45:47.063 --> 45:49.054
He's overplayed his hand.

45:50.300 --> 45:52.427
You see, it's the only thing

45:52.869 --> 45:55.337
that we're really
afraid of in death.

45:55.405 --> 45:58.568
We know it's inevitable,
we just don't know when.

45:58.708 --> 46:02.269
But now, don't you see,
now, I know

46:03.012 --> 46:05.105
that Death can't
cheat me of life,

46:05.181 --> 46:07.274
can't cheat me
of... of really,

46:07.517 --> 46:09.485
truly living a full life.

46:14.224 --> 46:15.657
Because now,

46:15.859 --> 46:18.953
I don't have to hold back
something

46:19.562 --> 46:22.725
to save for tomorrow,
for next year, next summer.

46:22.932 --> 46:25.423
Now, I know that
there never will be

46:26.236 --> 46:27.794
another summer.

46:29.105 --> 46:31.403
I know there
never will be another

46:32.041 --> 46:34.475
morning quite as
glorious as this.

46:36.312 --> 46:37.802
You see, I won

46:38.648 --> 46:40.775
because
I've nothing to lose.

46:42.218 --> 46:46.120
What about Joan, Buck? You know,
she loves you very much.

46:46.623 --> 46:48.420
Joan? Tell Joan...

46:49.292 --> 46:50.623
What, Buck?

46:50.693 --> 46:52.251
Tell Joan
she's a good woman,

46:52.328 --> 46:54.296
and I'll meet her
for lunch on Molokai.

46:55.431 --> 46:58.161
Give me a hand here, will you,
and get this thing aloft.

47:07.043 --> 47:08.169
Buck.

47:09.479 --> 47:12.312
What's a pal for
if not to see a pal off, huh?

47:14.784 --> 47:16.479
Okay,
drop the nose.

47:36.105 --> 47:38.130
Don't look so grim, Magnum.

47:38.207 --> 47:40.175
With my luck, I'll make it.
