00:01.305 --> 00:02.219
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.263 --> 00:05.135
I'M SORRY THEY LEFT
WITHOUT YOU.

00:05.179 --> 00:06.397
WELL, I'M NOT

00:06.441 --> 00:08.138
BECAUSE IF I WAS
WITH THEM,

00:08.182 --> 00:10.445
I NEVER WOULD
HAVE MET YOU.

00:10.488 --> 00:14.536
CLARKE: TELL RAVEN TO AIM
FOR THE ONE SPOT OF GREEN,
AND YOU'LL FIND ME.

00:14.579 --> 00:16.320
MURPHY: WHY EXACTLY
ARE WE SITTING HERE
IN THE DARK?

00:16.364 --> 00:19.323
FIRST WE FIND OUT
WHO THEY ARE AND THEN
WE ASK THEM FOR HELP.

00:19.367 --> 00:20.542
-RADIO SOUNDS.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.152
THEIR COMMS
MIGHT BE DISABLED.

00:22.196 --> 00:23.371
OR THE SHIP
COULD BE UNMANNED.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.981
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER,
AS LONG AS THEY GET US

00:25.025 --> 00:26.765
-DOWN TO THE GROUND.
-SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.158
HARPER:
A SECOND SHIP.

00:28.202 --> 00:29.159
THAT MUST BE
A TRANSPORT.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.248
IT'S HEADED
FOR THE GROUND.

00:33.250 --> 00:37.385
CLARKE: I USED TO THINK
THAT LIFE WAS ABOUT MORE
THAN JUST SURVIVING,

00:37.428 --> 00:38.821
BUT I'M NOT SURE ANYMORE.

00:38.864 --> 00:40.170
DIYOZA: ALL CLEAR!

00:40.214 --> 00:42.390
SWEEP THE VILLAGE AND THE WOODS.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.174
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT WE'RE
DEALING WITH HERE.

00:44.218 --> 00:46.568
CLARKE: ANIMALS DON'T FEEL
GUILTY WHEN THEY KILL.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.831
THEY JUST DO IT;
THEY KILL...

00:48.874 --> 00:50.485
OR THEY GET KILLED.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.315
WAIT. I THINK HE
MIGHT BE A GOOD GUY.

00:54.358 --> 00:55.620
THERE ARE NO GOOD GUYS.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.579
CLARKE: IT WAS US OR THEM,

00:57.622 --> 00:59.102
KILL OR BE KILLED.

00:59.146 --> 01:01.148
-MEANS WE'RE NOT ALONE.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.150
CLARKE: SIMPLE AS THAT.

01:17.425 --> 01:20.080
MAN: HELP! HELP ME!

01:20.123 --> 01:22.082
DIYOZA: THIS WAY!

01:22.125 --> 01:25.346
MAN: HELP! HELP!

01:25.389 --> 01:26.477
HELP!

01:28.392 --> 01:30.133
HELP!

01:34.398 --> 01:37.358
MADI: CLARKE,
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

01:37.401 --> 01:40.187
MADI, I KNOW THAT
THIS IS OUR HOME,

01:40.230 --> 01:42.406
YOUR HOME.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.584
AND THEY WANT
TO TAKE IT FROM US.

01:46.628 --> 01:49.196
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:49.239 --> 01:51.328
BUT HE DOESN'T
HAVE TO SUFFER.

01:51.372 --> 01:53.722
WE CAN KILL HIM
NOW, RIGHT?

01:56.333 --> 01:58.901
NOT YET.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.342
HELP!

02:05.386 --> 02:07.866
OH! HELP ME!

02:09.216 --> 02:10.434
DIYOZA: HOLD.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.655
I SAID HOLD.

02:13.698 --> 02:16.310
THIS IS NOT YOUR DAMN ARMY.
I'M NOT JUST GONNA LET A MAN--

02:17.702 --> 02:19.922
MAN: HELP! HELP!

02:25.275 --> 02:26.407
HELP!

02:26.450 --> 02:29.279
DIYOZA: THAT RIDGE LINE,
ONE O'CLOCK.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.238
-YEAH.
-LIGHT IT UP.

02:31.281 --> 02:33.240
MY PLEASURE.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.266
MADI.

03:00.919 --> 03:03.357
MADI?

03:03.400 --> 03:06.795
MADI, ARE YOU OK?

03:06.838 --> 03:10.015
GET UP. RUN! RUN.

03:10.059 --> 03:12.975
MCCREARY:
THEY'RE ON THE MOVE.

03:14.281 --> 03:17.545
DIYOZA: GET ME SOMEONE
TO INTERROGATE.

03:17.588 --> 03:21.766
THAT MEANS ALIVE,
MCCREARY. YOU COPY?

03:23.464 --> 03:25.640
I COPY.

03:25.683 --> 03:28.556
ON ME.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.341
AAH!

03:31.385 --> 03:33.648
DIYOZA: GO TO THE SHIP.

03:33.691 --> 03:38.000
GET ME A STRETCHER
AND A MED KIT, NOW.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.610
A MED KIT?

03:39.654 --> 03:42.744
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY
TAUGHT THORACIC SURGERY
IN SEAL TRAINING.

03:42.787 --> 03:46.182
MAYBE IF YOU DIDN'T MAKE
PAXTON "GRAVEYARD" MCCREARY

03:46.226 --> 03:47.966
YOUR RIGHT HAND, WE'D
STILL HAVE A DOCTOR--

03:52.014 --> 03:57.149
MCCREARY'S STILL USEFUL,
AND SO ARE YOU, FOR NOW.

03:57.193 --> 04:00.501
GO TO WAR WITH
THE ARMY YOU HAVE,
NOT THE ARMY YOU WANT.

04:00.544 --> 04:04.156
WHY DOES IT HAVE
TO BE WAR AT ALL?

04:04.200 --> 04:07.159
SPOKEN LIKE A MAN
WHO GAVE UP JETS
FOR SPACESHIPS.

04:07.203 --> 04:10.337
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I CHOOSE SPEED OVER
DEATH EVERY TIME.

04:10.380 --> 04:14.384
HOW ABOUT LIFE
OVER DEATH, LIEUTENANT?

04:14.428 --> 04:16.778
DO YOU CHOOSE THAT, TOO?

04:16.821 --> 04:19.041
WITHOUT THIS VALLEY,
WE DIE.

04:19.084 --> 04:23.132
I'D SAY THAT'S
WORTH FIGHTING OVER,
WOULDN'T YOU?

04:24.829 --> 04:27.484
GLAD WE GOT THAT
CLEARED UP.

05:12.399 --> 05:16.794
RAVEN: BOYS AND GIRLS,
MEET ELIGIUS IV.

05:18.405 --> 05:21.451
EMORI: "POWERING
A BETTER TOMORROW."

05:21.495 --> 05:23.105
MUST BE A MINING SHIP.

05:23.148 --> 05:25.237
-I'VE HEARD STORIES.

05:25.281 --> 05:28.589
MONTY: MISSIONS SENT
TO MINE ASTEROIDS OR SEARCH
FOR HABITABLE PLANETS,

05:28.632 --> 05:31.722
BUT THAT WAS
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.594
THEY GOT BACK
SOMEHOW.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.073
MEANS THEY MUST
HAVE FUEL.

05:35.117 --> 05:39.339
WELL, NOW THERE'S A SHIP
WITH A STORY TO TELL.

05:41.515 --> 05:44.909
IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF
THE ENGINES WAS DESTROYED.

05:44.953 --> 05:47.303
RAVEN: AT LEAST THE HAP
IS STILL ROTATING.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.392
THAT ROTATION MEANS
THEY'LL HAVE GRAVITY.

05:49.436 --> 05:53.309
SORRY, LOVEBIRDS.
NO ZERO-G SPACE SEX.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.138
THERE.
THERE'S THE DOCKING BAY.

05:56.181 --> 05:58.401
MONTY: I HATE TO ASK THIS NOW.
WHAT IF THEY'RE STILL INSIDE?

05:58.445 --> 06:01.448
ECHO: WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS; IF THEY
WERE STILL INSIDE AND SAW

06:01.491 --> 06:04.364
A FOREIGN SHIP TRYING
TO BOARD THEM, THEY WOULD
SHOOT US OUT OF THE SKY.

06:04.407 --> 06:05.756
RAVEN: OK.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.629
COMMENCING OPERATION
UNINVITED GUESTS.

FIRING THRUSTERS
IN 3, 2, 1.

06:16.463 --> 06:20.815
EMORI, SOON AS I
LINE US UP WITH THE HAP,
IT'S ALL YOURS.

06:20.858 --> 06:23.470
ON MY MARK.

06:23.513 --> 06:25.820
OK, WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.517
RAVEN:
THE NAV IS YOURS.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.519
IT'S JUST LIKE
THE SIMULATOR.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.391
EMORI: COPY THAT.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.914
GROUNDERS DON'T SAY,
"COPY THAT."

06:32.957 --> 06:36.961
THIS ONE DOES.
INITIATING DOCKING SEQUENCE.

06:40.312 --> 06:41.705
MURPHY:
WE ARE SO SCREWED.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.315
EMORI:
SHUT UP, JOHN.

06:43.359 --> 06:45.666
RAVEN: WHY ARE WE
LOSING ALIGNMENT?

06:45.709 --> 06:47.581
I LOST STABILIZATION.

06:47.624 --> 06:48.843
I DON'T KNOW.

06:48.886 --> 06:51.367
WE'RE COMING IN
TOO FAST!

06:51.411 --> 06:54.718
OK, I GOT IT! I GOT IT!
SWITCHING BACK
TO MANUAL.

07:02.552 --> 07:05.860
OK. HOLD ON. HOLD ON!

07:10.430 --> 07:14.303
BRACE FOR IMPACT.
WE'RE COMING IN HOT!

07:16.523 --> 07:18.176
-OOH!
-UH!

07:21.528 --> 07:25.445
MURPHY: THAT WAS FUN.
WE SHOULD DO THAT
AGAIN SOMETIME.

07:31.494 --> 07:35.585
BELLAMY: OK. LET'S GO
FIND THAT FUEL.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.110
ON ME.

07:39.154 --> 07:42.157
SUITS OFF
IN THE CARGO HOLD.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.470
BELLAMY: COME ON.
WE GOT TO MOVE FAST.

07:52.863 --> 07:55.605
ECHO: WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE'RE WALKING INTO.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.610
MURPHY: THAT'S
JUST ANNOYING.

08:00.654 --> 08:04.527
HARPER: IF SOMEONE
WAS HERE, THEY'D
SHUT IT OFF, RIGHT?

08:05.702 --> 08:07.661
HEY, NOT YOU.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.837
YOU SHOULD STAY IN
THE POD AND RUN A FULL
DIAGNOSTIC CHECK.

08:09.880 --> 08:13.275
THAT WAS A BIG IMPACT.
WE DON'T KNOW IF WE
TOOK ON ANY DAMAGE.

08:13.318 --> 08:16.278
I CAN, UH,
STAY BACK AND HELP.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.236
HOW, MAKING STUPID
LITTLE JOKES?

08:18.280 --> 08:21.805
DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON ME
BECAUSE YOU SCREWED THE POOCH
IN YOUR BIG DEBUT, OK?

08:21.849 --> 08:24.808
HEY, HEY...

08:24.852 --> 08:26.767
HARPER CAN HELP EMORI.

08:26.810 --> 08:29.683

PAST THIS POINT."

09:01.932 --> 09:03.586
INMATES?

09:03.630 --> 09:05.327
MONTY: PRISON LABOR.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.938
THE MINING MISSIONS
WERE DANGEROUS.

09:07.982 --> 09:10.811
THEY SENT PEOPLE THEY
THOUGHT WERE DISPOSABLE.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.769
SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

09:12.813 --> 09:16.686
RAVEN: RELAX.
OUR ANCESTORS WERE PRISONERS
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

09:16.730 --> 09:20.472
THEIR DESCENDANTS
ON THAT TRANSPORT SHIP ARE
SURVIVORS, JUST LIKE US.

09:20.516 --> 09:24.302
THE BRIDGE IS THIS WAY.
COME ON.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.614
RAVEN: LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
FORGOT THEIR KEY.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.790
JACKPOT.

HAPPENED HERE.

THE SHIP'S MANIFEST
AND SCHEMATICS SO WE CAN

09:41.189 --> 09:42.494
FIND OUT WHERE THEY KEEP
THEIR HYDRAZINE?

09:42.538 --> 09:45.497
RAVEN: YES, BUT FIRST
LET'S KILL THIS ALARM.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.763
THANK YOU.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.765
MONTY: FUEL SYSTEMS.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.201
GOT IT.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.986
MURPHY:
OH, CAPTAIN'S CHAIR.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.337
RAVEN: THE SHIP DOESN'T
RUN ON HYDRAZINE.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.688
THEY COULD NEVER
STORE ENOUGH FOR
A LONG-DURATION MISSION.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.777
BELLAMY:
WELL, WHAT, THEN?

10:03.820 --> 10:05.953
IT LOOKS LIKE...
HYTHYLODIUM.

10:05.996 --> 10:08.651
MONTY: MUST BE WHAT
THEY WERE MINING FOR,
INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT ENERGY--

10:08.695 --> 10:10.348
MURPHY: SPARE ME
THE SCIENCE LESSON.

10:10.392 --> 10:11.828
CAN WE USE IT TO LAND
THE POD OR NOT?

10:11.872 --> 10:14.265
SURE, IF YOU WANT

IN YOUR BODY.

10:14.309 --> 10:15.179
RAVEN.

10:15.223 --> 10:17.007
RAVEN: DON'T WORRY.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.574
JUST BECAUSE THIS SHIP
DOESN'T RUN ON HYDRAZINE

10:18.618 --> 10:21.751
DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T
HAVE ANY ON BOARD.

10:21.795 --> 10:22.970
THE DROPSHIP.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.319
SHORT-RANGE TRANSPORT.

10:24.362 --> 10:27.931
THEY'D HAVE TO HAVE
A SUPPLY FOR REFUELING.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.108
BOOM.

OUR RADIOS WERE BLOCKED

26:14.529 --> 26:16.270
RAVEN: MAYBE NOT.

26:18.098 --> 26:20.404
WE CAN LEAVE THEM
HERE LIKE THIS,

26:20.448 --> 26:23.103
BUT BLOCK THE SIGNAL
FROM THE GROUND SO THEY
CAN'T WAKE THEM UP.

26:23.146 --> 26:26.367
MURPHY: THEY HAVE A SHUTTLE.
THEY CAN JUST COME BACK UP
AND DO IT THEMSELVES.

26:26.410 --> 26:29.239
CAN YOU RIG IT
SO WE CAN KILL THEM
REMOTELY?

26:29.283 --> 26:32.634
IT'S TRICKY...
BUT POSSIBLE. WHY?

26:32.678 --> 26:34.375
LEVERAGE--

26:34.418 --> 26:37.770
"PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS
OR WE PULL THE PLUG."

26:37.813 --> 26:39.859
HOW LONG DO YOU NEED
TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE?

26:39.902 --> 26:41.774
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'M ON IT.

26:41.817 --> 26:43.776
BELLAMY:
WAIT.

26:43.819 --> 26:45.604
MURPHY.

26:47.954 --> 26:50.217
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK.

26:50.260 --> 26:53.263
I THINK IT'S A RISK.

26:53.307 --> 26:55.875
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS.

26:55.918 --> 26:58.181
BUT CLARKE DIDN'T DIE
FOR US TO LIVE

26:58.225 --> 27:00.183
JUST SO WE CAN GO BACK
TO THE GROUND

27:00.227 --> 27:03.012
AND MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKES.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.712
WHAT THE HELL?

27:06.755 --> 27:09.932
LET'S BE GOOD GUYS.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.044
COME ON.

27:35.088 --> 27:37.873
WHAT HARM CAN COME
FROM TELLING ME YOUR NAME?

27:40.920 --> 27:43.183
WELL, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

27:43.226 --> 27:46.229
THIS IS THE BEST
CONVERSATION I'VE HAD

27:46.273 --> 27:49.580
IN OVER A HUNDRED YEARS.

27:51.931 --> 27:55.717
I WAS AN ALTAR BOY IN
A CHURCH JUST LIKE THIS.

27:56.936 --> 27:58.894
SAGINAW,

27:58.938 --> 28:01.680
ABOUT TWO HOURS
OUTSIDE DETROIT.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.944
ON MY HARLEY,

28:04.987 --> 28:07.642
I'D MAKE IT IN ONE.

28:09.818 --> 28:12.647
GOD, I MISS THAT BIKE...

28:14.431 --> 28:16.738
MORE THAN I MISS MOST
OF THE PEOPLE.

28:16.782 --> 28:20.524
MCCREARY, ON RADIO:
SOMEONE JUST RAN OUT
OF THAT CAVE.

28:20.568 --> 28:22.613
HARRIS, FALK,
WATCH YOUR SIX.

28:22.657 --> 28:24.833
MAN, ON RADIO: COPY THAT.
TIGHT INTERCEPT.

28:24.877 --> 28:25.965
FAST LITTLE THING.

28:26.008 --> 28:28.750
WE CAN CUT HER OFF
AT THE LAKE. GO WEST.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.796
CHANGING DIRECTION NOW.

28:30.839 --> 28:33.755
WAIT, SCRATCH THAT.
SHE'S TURNING NORTH.

28:33.799 --> 28:34.887
I GOT A SHOT.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.932
NO.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.978
SHE'S JUST A CHILD.

28:39.021 --> 28:40.153
DIYOZA: SHE SPEAKS.

28:40.196 --> 28:42.024
CLARKE: PLEASE.

28:42.068 --> 28:43.634
HOW MANY OTHERS ARE
IN THE WOODS?

28:43.678 --> 28:45.898
NONE. IT'S JUST
THE TWO OF US.

28:45.941 --> 28:48.161
I AM BEGGING YOU.
TELL HIM NOT TO SHOOT.

28:48.204 --> 28:50.772
-FIRE AT WILL.
-COPY.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.774
MCCREARY: SHE WENT BEHIND
THOSE TWIN ROCKS!

28:52.818 --> 28:54.733
FALK! TAKE HER ON
THE OTHER SIDE!

28:54.776 --> 28:57.344
I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.
THAT'S OUR SUMMER
HUNTING GROUNDS.

28:57.387 --> 28:59.738
SHE'S LEADING THEM
INTO A TRAP.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.958
FALK, ON RADIO:
I SEE HER. GOING IN.
COVER ME.

29:03.002 --> 29:04.525
LISTEN TO ME.

29:04.568 --> 29:07.920
IF THEY DON'T STOP RIGHT NOW,
THOSE MEN WILL DIE.

29:07.963 --> 29:09.748
FALK, ON RADIO:
I SEE HER. I'M GOING IN.

29:09.791 --> 29:12.315
-I BELIEVE HER.
-IT'S THE TRUTH.

29:13.752 --> 29:17.190
IF YOU LET HER GO,
I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

29:22.717 --> 29:24.414
ALL UNITS...

29:24.458 --> 29:25.938
STAND DOWN.
OVER.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.941
MCCREARY, ON RADIO: IF WE
STAND DOWN, SHE'LL GET AWAY.

29:28.984 --> 29:30.681
I'M TAKING THE SHOT.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.858
DIYOZA: FALK,
IF MCCREARY DISOBEYS,

29:32.901 --> 29:34.294
SHOOT HIM IN THE LEG.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.296
HARRIS,
IF FALK DISOBEYS,

29:36.339 --> 29:38.907
SHOOT HIM IN THE HEAD.

29:38.951 --> 29:41.823
MCCREARY, ON RADIO:
STANDING DOWN.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.564
DIYOZA: GOOD CHOICE.

29:43.607 --> 29:46.175
THERE MAY BE TRAPS
NEAR YOUR POSITION.

29:46.219 --> 29:49.178
CHECK IT OUT AND
REPORT BACK. OVER.

29:55.010 --> 29:56.969
MCCREARY, ON RADIO:
SON OF A BITCH.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.971
ANOTHER BEAR TRAP.

29:59.014 --> 30:01.495
ALMOST STEPPED RIGHT IN IT.

30:01.538 --> 30:04.019
REPORT TO BASE CAMP.
OVER AND OUT.

30:04.063 --> 30:05.673
THANK YOU.

30:05.716 --> 30:08.284
DIYOZA: THANK YOU
FOR TELLING THE TRUTH.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.504
AS LONG AS YOU
KEEP DOING THAT,

30:10.547 --> 30:12.985
YOUR FRIEND IN THE WOODS WILL
STAY ALIVE, AND SO WILL YOU.

30:13.028 --> 30:14.987
DO WE UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER?

30:15.030 --> 30:16.815
YES.

30:18.599 --> 30:21.515
GOOD. THEN LET'S BEGIN.

30:21.558 --> 30:23.822
START WITH HOW
THE WORLD ENDED.

30:30.916 --> 30:33.440
WHICH TIME?

30:53.808 --> 30:55.331
RAVEN.

30:56.811 --> 30:58.987
SOMEONE HAS TO
STAY UP HERE.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.380
WHAT?

31:00.423 --> 31:03.905
WITH REMOTE ACCESS
TO THE CRYO-PODS BLOCKED,

31:03.949 --> 31:06.603
WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO OPERATE THEM, EITHER.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.997
PULLING THE PLUG FROM
THE GROUND IS NOT AN OPTION.

31:09.041 --> 31:11.043
SOMEONE HAS TO STAY.

31:11.086 --> 31:12.827
NO. NO. NO WAY.

31:12.871 --> 31:16.135
OK, WE MAKE THE THREAT FROM
UP HERE ON THE LASERCOM.

31:16.178 --> 31:18.224
WE WON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE
FOLLOWING THROUGH.

31:18.267 --> 31:20.617
LOOK, I'VE PLAYED OUT
EVERY ANGLE.

31:20.661 --> 31:24.230
THIS ONLY WORKS IF WE
HAVE EYES ON THE GROUND.

31:24.273 --> 31:25.971
FINE.

31:26.014 --> 31:28.147
SHOW ME HOW TO DO IT.
I...

31:28.190 --> 31:29.975
I CAN'T.

31:30.018 --> 31:33.065
THERE ARE NINE
SECURITY MEASURES
TO BE BYPASSED,

31:33.108 --> 31:34.936
AND TEACHING YOU
WOULD TAKE DAYS, AND

31:34.980 --> 31:38.679
KNOWING YOU,
YOU'D PROBABLY
STILL SCREW IT UP.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.119
IT HAS TO BE ME.

31:44.163 --> 31:47.340
I AM NOT
LEAVING YOU HERE.

31:47.383 --> 31:49.081
I'LL BE FINE.

31:49.124 --> 31:53.041
EMORI CAN GET YOU DOWN.
THAT'S WHAT I
TRAINED HER FOR.

31:53.085 --> 31:56.044
YOU NEED TO GO
AND FIND YOUR SISTER,

31:56.088 --> 31:58.960
AND MAKE A DEAL
FOR PEACE WITH
THE PRISONERS.

31:59.004 --> 32:01.702
ONCE EVERYONE'S FRIENDS,
THEY'LL COME BACK UP
FOR THEIR PEOPLE,

32:01.745 --> 32:03.704
AND I'LL HITCH A RIDE
DOWN WITH THEM.

32:03.747 --> 32:06.707
WHAT IF THE THREAT
DOESN'T WORK?

32:06.750 --> 32:09.231
YOU'LL BE STUCK
UP HERE, RAVEN.

32:09.275 --> 32:12.321
YOU'LL HAVE TO KILL
300 PEOPLE.

32:12.365 --> 32:15.063
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT?

32:15.107 --> 32:18.110
NO, NO, WE'LL COME UP
WITH SOMETHING ELSE.

32:18.153 --> 32:21.330
I LEFT CLARKE BEHIND
TO DIE, AND I...

32:21.374 --> 32:25.073
I'M NOT DOING THAT
AGAIN.

32:27.206 --> 32:29.904
THERE'S AN ESCAPE POD,
YOU IDIOT.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.602
FOR THE CAPTAIN
AND FIRST MATE.

32:32.646 --> 32:36.041
WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER,
IF YOU FAIL,

32:36.084 --> 32:39.000
I CAN GO DOWN IN THAT.

32:43.874 --> 32:45.964
HEY.

32:47.835 --> 32:49.793
SIX YEARS AGO,
I PROMISED MYSELF

32:49.837 --> 32:53.014
I WOULD FIND A WAY
TO GET US BACK DOWN.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.973
BELLAMY, THIS IS IT.

32:56.148 --> 32:59.455
PLEASE...

32:59.499 --> 33:02.110
LET ME GET YOU ALL HOME.

33:08.987 --> 33:12.381
BELLAMY: ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO THIS.

33:12.425 --> 33:14.601
WHERE THE HELL IS SHE?

33:16.211 --> 33:18.648
IT'S TECHNICAL,
BUT, UM,

33:18.692 --> 33:20.607
SOMEONE HAS TO RUN
THINGS FROM HERE.

33:20.650 --> 33:23.044
SO LET IT BE JOHN.

33:23.088 --> 33:26.047
BELLAMY: I SAID
IT'S TECHNICAL.

33:30.138 --> 33:31.400
I'LL DO IT.

33:31.444 --> 33:33.533
MONTY, I--

33:35.230 --> 33:36.579
ENOUGH.

33:36.623 --> 33:38.233
IT HAS TO BE RAVEN.

33:38.277 --> 33:41.410
ONCE WE HAVE A TRUCE,
SHE'LL COME DOWN WITH
THE PRISONERS.

33:41.454 --> 33:44.587
IF WE FAIL, SHE'LL TAKE
THE SHIP'S ESCAPE POD.

33:44.631 --> 33:46.415
EITHER WAY,
SHE WILL BE FINE.

33:46.459 --> 33:50.071
EMORI: IF I'M FLYING SOLO,
SHE'LL BE THE ONLY ONE.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.507
YOU GOT THIS.

33:51.551 --> 33:54.728
LET'S LOAD UP.
LET'S GO.

33:59.341 --> 34:01.300
NOW, MURPHY.

34:01.343 --> 34:04.216
I'M STAYING, TOO.

34:05.608 --> 34:08.698
LOOK, RAVEN MIGHT
NEED BACKUP.

34:10.613 --> 34:14.835
WHAT? WITH EMORI FLYING,
THIS IS THE SURVIVOR'S MOVE.

34:16.532 --> 34:18.708
SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.

34:31.156 --> 34:33.897
MURPHY: YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT A BAD VIEW.

34:33.941 --> 34:36.291
MURPHY, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:36.335 --> 34:37.858
KEEPING YOU COMPANY.

34:37.901 --> 34:39.947
YOU'RE WELCOME,
BY THE WAY.

34:39.990 --> 34:41.862
WHY WAS EVERYONE
SO SURPRISED?

34:41.905 --> 34:43.864
I MEAN, IF THERE WASN'T
AN ESCAPE POD, I COULD
UNDERSTAND--

34:43.907 --> 34:46.823
THERE ISN'T
AN ESCAPE POD.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.390
WHAT?

34:48.434 --> 34:50.131
I ONLY TOLD BELLAMY THAT
BECAUSE I KNEW

34:50.175 --> 34:53.178
HE WOULD NEVER LEAVE ME
BEHIND WITHOUT A WAY DOWN.

34:59.358 --> 35:01.229
YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:01.273 --> 35:03.971
YOU'RE RIGHT.

35:04.014 --> 35:06.191
DYING ALONE
WOULD HAVE SUCKED.

35:06.234 --> 35:07.844
YEAH.

35:07.888 --> 35:09.803
THANKS.

35:18.551 --> 35:21.728
SON OF A BITCH.

35:33.218 --> 35:35.263
COMPUTER VOICE: 19,000 METERS.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.135
OK.

35:39.441 --> 35:42.314
COMPUTER VOICE: 18,000 METERS.

35:42.357 --> 35:43.663
OK.

35:43.706 --> 35:45.621
COMPUTER VOICE: 17,000 METERS.

35:45.665 --> 35:47.667
JUST BREATHE.

35:49.321 --> 35:50.322
COMPUTER VOICE: 16,000 METERS.

35:50.365 --> 35:52.193
EMORI: FIRING
THE COLD GAS THRUSTERS

35:52.237 --> 35:55.153
TO INITIATE ROLL MANEUVER.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.461
COMPUTER VOICE: 12,000 METERS.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.202
EMORI: COMPUTER...

36:01.246 --> 36:03.509
LIGHT BOOSTBACK ENGINES.

36:03.552 --> 36:05.206
COMPUTER VOICE:
BOOSTBACK ENGINES FIRED

36:05.250 --> 36:08.035
IN 3, 2, 1.

36:09.863 --> 36:12.909
-2,000 METERS.
-DEPLOY LANDING LEGS.

36:12.953 --> 36:15.695
COMPUTER VOICE:
LANDING LEGS DEPLOYED.

36:15.738 --> 36:17.392
GRID FINS ACTIVATED.

36:17.436 --> 36:19.220
HERE WE GO!

36:19.264 --> 36:21.657
COMPUTER VOICE: 200 METERS.

36:29.361 --> 36:31.276
VERTICAL LANDING SUCCESSFUL.

36:35.367 --> 36:37.934
YOU DID IT.

36:40.415 --> 36:43.288
-EMORI.

36:43.331 --> 36:44.898
EMORI.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.119
WE DIDN'T DIE.

36:49.163 --> 36:51.339
NO. NO, WE DIDN'T.

36:53.298 --> 36:57.780
ECHO: WE'LL CELEBRATE
ONCE MURPHY AND RAVEN
ARE BACK DOWN, TOO.

36:57.824 --> 37:00.043
THERE'S NO TELLING
HOW MANY PEOPLE SAW US.

37:00.087 --> 37:02.350
WE NEED TO TAKE COVER
IN THE TREES BEFORE
THEY GET HERE.

37:02.394 --> 37:04.613
YEAH.

37:08.530 --> 37:10.315
OK.

37:14.754 --> 37:16.799
HARPER:
IT'S SO QUIET.

37:16.843 --> 37:19.280
OK, SO HOW DO WE
FIND THEM?

37:19.324 --> 37:22.892
WE DON'T.
THEY'LL FIND US.

37:22.936 --> 37:25.504
BELLAMY: THEY ALREADY HAVE.

37:25.547 --> 37:27.027
MAN: EVERYBODY,
ON YOUR KNEES!

37:27.070 --> 37:30.204
BELLAMY: IT'S OK, IT'S OK.
WE DON'T WANT TO FIGHT--

37:30.248 --> 37:31.466
-NOW!
-NO, WAIT!

37:31.510 --> 37:32.380
WE JUST WANT TO TALK.

37:32.424 --> 37:34.034
ON THE ARK, THEY TAUGHT US

37:34.077 --> 37:37.646
THAT THE WAR STARTED
AS A CHINESE FIRST STRIKE,

37:37.690 --> 37:39.561
BUT THEY WERE WRONG.

37:39.605 --> 37:42.042
IT WAS STARTED BY
AN A.I. CALLED A.L.I.E.

37:42.085 --> 37:43.522
HER INTENTION WAS
TO REDUCE THE POPU--

37:43.565 --> 37:45.437
MAN, ON RADIO: COLONEL,
WE HAVE FIVE MORE HOSTILES.

37:45.480 --> 37:49.179
AT LEAST ONE IS ARMED.
ARE WE STILL PLAYING NICE?

37:54.272 --> 37:55.534
STAND BY.

37:55.577 --> 37:56.796
FIND OUT WHERE THEY ARE

37:56.839 --> 37:58.493
AND REINFORCE
THEIR POSITION.

37:58.537 --> 37:59.668
YOU HEARD HER.
GRAB THE GEAR.

37:59.712 --> 38:01.235
NOT YOU, MCCREARY.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.716
WHAT DID I TELL YOU WOULD HAPPEN
IF YOU LIED TO ME?

38:03.759 --> 38:05.718
I DIDN'T LIE.

38:05.761 --> 38:08.329
I DON'T KNOW--UH!

38:10.592 --> 38:12.551
TAKE HER OUTSIDE.

38:12.594 --> 38:13.465
USE THE COLLAR.

38:13.508 --> 38:16.337
I THOUGHT YOU'D
NEVER ASK.

38:16.381 --> 38:18.383
SHAW: COLONEL...

38:18.426 --> 38:20.080
SHE'S COOPERATING.

38:20.123 --> 38:21.995
WHICH IS WHY SHE'LL LIVE.

38:22.038 --> 38:24.693
HER FRIENDS,
ON THE OTHER HAND...

38:27.000 --> 38:29.437
DIYOZA, ON RADIO:
FOUR OF OURS ARE DEAD.

38:29.481 --> 38:31.265
IT'S TIME TO EVEN THE SCORE.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.484
CONGRATULATIONS.

38:32.527 --> 38:35.313
ONE OF YOU GETS
TO LIVE.

38:35.356 --> 38:36.488
AGH!

38:44.452 --> 38:46.324
SHE'S JUST A KID.

38:47.673 --> 38:49.805
BELLAMY?

38:52.460 --> 38:54.723
CLARKE KNEW
YOU WOULD COME.

38:58.379 --> 38:59.554
CLARKE'S ALIVE?

38:59.598 --> 39:02.340
SHE'S IN TROUBLE.
WE HAVE TO GO.

39:02.383 --> 39:04.211
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS
IN THE BUNKER?

39:04.254 --> 39:05.299
STILL THERE.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.562
WHAT? NO, NO.
HOW CAN THAT BE?

39:07.606 --> 39:10.304
I'LL EXPLAIN
ON THE WAY.

39:22.316 --> 39:24.536
I WOULDN'T DO THAT
IF I WAS YOU.

39:24.579 --> 39:27.234
YOU MIGHT BURN
YOUR FINGERS.

39:31.717 --> 39:33.588
YEAH. HA!

39:41.553 --> 39:43.729
CLARKE: PLEASE.

39:43.772 --> 39:45.818
I WASN'T LYING.

39:45.861 --> 39:48.168
DIYOZA: HIT HER AGAIN.

39:48.211 --> 39:50.823
[COLLAR SIZZLING,
CLARKE GROANING]

39:54.000 --> 39:57.177
CLARKE: I DON'T KNOW
WHO THAT WAS.

40:00.093 --> 40:02.051
I GUESS YOU MADE
YOUR POINT.

40:02.095 --> 40:04.314
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

40:04.358 --> 40:06.491
BUT JUST IN CASE,

40:06.534 --> 40:08.623
HIT HER AGAIN.

40:11.496 --> 40:12.801
HA HA!

40:12.845 --> 40:15.587
DIYOZA: HOLD,
AND FIRE ON MY COMMAND.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.594
CLARKE: MADI.

40:22.637 --> 40:24.509
NO.

40:24.552 --> 40:26.119
BELLAMY: MADI, NO.

40:26.162 --> 40:28.904
TAKE THE ROVER BACK.
THAT'S THE PLAN.

40:28.948 --> 40:31.951
I WON'T LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO CLARKE. I PROMISE.

40:31.994 --> 40:34.475
DIYOZA: COME OUT
WITH YOUR HANDS HIGH.

40:48.707 --> 40:50.665
BELLAMY: UNARMED.

40:50.709 --> 40:52.319
JUST WANT TO TALK.

40:52.362 --> 40:54.190
DIYOZA: TALK.

40:54.234 --> 40:57.585
GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON
NOT TO KILL YOU
WHERE YOU STAND.

40:57.629 --> 41:00.849
HOW ABOUT I GIVE YOU 283?

41:00.893 --> 41:04.026
THAT'S HOW MANY OF
YOUR PEOPLE ARE GONNA DIE

41:04.070 --> 41:06.464
IF YOU AND I CAN'T
MAKE A DEAL.

41:30.531 --> 41:33.534
THAT'S FAR ENOUGH.

41:33.578 --> 41:37.407
283 LIVES FOR ONE.

41:37.451 --> 41:40.236
SHE MUST BE PRETTY
IMPORTANT TO YOU.

41:43.283 --> 41:44.589
SHE IS.
