You miss your first session,
they won't refund my money.

01:51.544 --> 01:54.047
I forgot, i gotta take
care of this first.

02:18.071 --> 02:23.576
Here he is.

02:23.576 --> 02:25.578
How's it goin', buddy?

02:25.578 --> 02:27.580
Don't you own
a fuckin' mirror?

02:28.081 --> 02:34.587
You look like you
been french kissing
the pillsbury dough boy.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.590
Alright, c'mon, what do
you got for me, man?

02:47.100 --> 02:48.601
What the fuck, dominic?

02:48.601 --> 02:50.103
It's half.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.604
Three fuckin' weeks
in a row now.

02:51.604 --> 02:52.605
Business slow!

02:52.605 --> 02:57.110
We tell you!

02:57.110 --> 02:58.611
We pay security,
what for?

02:58.611 --> 02:59.612
Kid break window,
you do nothing!

03:00.113 --> 03:01.114
We pay no more!

03:01.114 --> 03:02.115
What'd she fuckin' say?

03:02.115 --> 03:03.616
Nothing,
don't listen to her.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.118
C'mon, honey,
let's go.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.619
Honey, out front.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.621
C'mon.

03:08.621 --> 03:10.623
Now!

03:10.623 --> 03:14.127
Fucking bitch.

03:14.127 --> 03:15.628
You got money for blow,
but not for us?

03:15.628 --> 03:18.631
Chris, please,
i'm sorry--

03:19.132 --> 03:20.633
"business slow."

03:20.633 --> 03:23.636
Half the fucking
neighborhood's out there
waiting for blow jobs.

03:23.636 --> 03:29.642
You drug- addict
motherfucker.

03:29.642 --> 03:32.145
This shit's
unacceptable.

03:41.154 --> 03:41.654
How's everything?

03:41.654 --> 03:45.658
How you doin', hon?

03:47.160 --> 03:49.162
Third time
this week, artie.

03:49.162 --> 03:56.169
He can't turn
down a four- top.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.670
You're done already?

03:57.670 --> 03:59.672
About time
you came back.

03:59.672 --> 04:00.673
I was about to
start on your drapes.

04:00.673 --> 04:02.175
What the fuck is that?

04:02.175 --> 04:03.676
Quail, ala' bucco.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.679
Baby quail stuffed
with fennel sausage.

04:06.679 --> 04:08.681
Can i get aids
from eating this?

04:08.681 --> 04:12.185
Hey, artie,
didn't i see this guy

04:12.185 --> 04:14.687
in the park this morning
takin' a shit on a statue?

04:14.687 --> 04:19.192
Jesus christ,
i'm tryin' something new.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.692
Hey, broaden
your horizons.

04:20.692 --> 04:22.695
Forget this fancy shit,
you know what you need here?

04:23.196 --> 04:25.198
Top- notch moozadell' maker.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.699
Like that kid
from the other side.

04:26.699 --> 04:28.201
The best fuckin' cheese
you ever had.

04:28.701 --> 04:29.202
The best.

04:29.702 --> 04:30.703
They get the real milk.

04:30.703 --> 04:32.705
Seriously, this kid,
all he does 24 hours a day

04:32.705 --> 04:34.707
he makes buffalo moozadell'.

04:34.707 --> 04:36.209
He's a master
cheese maker.

04:36.209 --> 04:40.213
So's paulie.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.215
Oh, yeah,
alright, alright.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.217
Arthur, the bank!

04:44.717 --> 04:45.218
Enjoy.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.719
I'll catch you later.

04:46.719 --> 04:48.221
You better run.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.223
Why don't she go
to the bank?

04:50.223 --> 04:53.726
Swing by after she takes
her broom for an oil change.

04:53.726 --> 04:54.727
I'll be right back.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.229
Good wine, no?

04:56.229 --> 04:57.230
Delicious.

05:03.236 --> 05:06.739
Artie.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.241
You know that guy
i was talkin' about

05:08.241 --> 05:09.242
over there with
the cheese?

05:09.742 --> 05:10.243
He's my cousin.

05:10.243 --> 05:11.244
Oh, yeah?

05:11.244 --> 05:12.745
Yeah.

05:12.745 --> 05:14.247
I haven't told anybody yet,
but he's coming over.

05:14.747 --> 05:15.748
I thought maybe
you can hire him,

05:15.748 --> 05:18.251
you know, help me out
with the immigration.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.753
Kitchen's pretty
packed, tony.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.255
I can barely pay myself.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.256
Did i ask you
to pay him?

05:23.256 --> 05:24.257
I'll take care
of the money.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.758
Why's he want
to come in here

05:25.758 --> 05:26.759
if he's already got
a job over there?

05:26.759 --> 05:29.262
You know what, either do me
the favor or not.

05:29.262 --> 05:32.265
Third grade on up,
you needed something,

05:32.265 --> 05:33.766
i was there,
no questions.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.769
Does he at least know
his ass from his schamozz'?

05:42.275 --> 05:45.278
The actor is the instrument
for conveying ideas.

05:45.278 --> 05:51.784
During the next...

05:51.784 --> 05:52.785
this is
"acting for writers"?

05:52.785 --> 05:54.787
And your first assignment
is to act like a writer

05:55.288 --> 05:56.789
who gets here on time.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.291
Sorry.

05:58.291 --> 06:01.294
The tunnel.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.296
As writers, you'll find
it enormously helpful

06:03.296 --> 06:05.798
to walk a mile in
the actor's shoes.

06:05.798 --> 06:09.302
Imagine being
an architect

06:09.302 --> 06:12.305
who's never
lifted a stone.

06:12.305 --> 06:15.808
Over the next few
weeks, we'll focus on
improv and scene study.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.811
Why don't we begin by
introducing ourselves?

06:18.811 --> 06:23.316
What your experience is,
where you're from...

06:23.316 --> 06:24.317
mitch mcdermott.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.818
Born and raised
in hartsdale,

06:25.818 --> 06:27.820
but please,
don't hold that against me.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.323
B. A. In english lit
from ithaca,

06:30.323 --> 06:32.325
i've written a few specs,

06:32.325 --> 06:34.327
haven't actually
sold anything yet.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.828
Right now i'm on
the sales team

06:35.828 --> 06:37.830
down at chick brauer,
porsche/audi.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.832
Great, welcome.

06:46.839 --> 06:49.842
My name is
chris maceveety.

06:49.842 --> 06:51.844
I work on wall street.

06:51.844 --> 06:54.847
Not on wall street,
but you know, stocks.

06:54.847 --> 06:56.349
You write?

06:56.349 --> 06:57.350
Yeah...

06:57.850 --> 06:58.851
i want to writ
e for the movies.

06:58.851 --> 07:00.353
"Goodfellas",
shit like that.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.855
Any special reason
you chose this class?

07:02.855 --> 07:04.357
I didn't.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.359
It's a birthday present
from my girlfriend.

07:06.859 --> 07:09.362
I had some problem
s with my screenplay

07:09.362 --> 07:10.363
so, i bought that book,

07:10.863 --> 07:12.865
"how to write
a movie in 21 days".

07:12.865 --> 07:15.368
That was like a year ago.

07:15.368 --> 07:18.371
Well, i can't guarantee
you'll write any faster,

07:18.371 --> 07:23.376
but hopefully you'll
learn a few things.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.878
My name is cynthia weller.

07:25.878 --> 07:27.380
I was born in savanna,

07:27.880 --> 07:30.383
but my family moved to
hempstead when i was five.

07:30.383 --> 07:33.386
Despite soprano's recent
medical furlough from jail,

07:33.886 --> 07:35.388
where he was
awaiting trial,

07:35.388 --> 07:37.390
sources in the u. S. Attorney's
office indicate that

07:37.390 --> 07:40.393
nephew anthony soprano
probably remains
the de facto boss

07:40.893 --> 07:42.395
of the north jersey mob.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.897
Soprano, seen here in an
fbi surveillance photo,

07:44.897 --> 07:48.401
with family associate salvatore
"big pussy" bonpensiero,

07:48.401 --> 07:51.404
was believed to be
the target of a botched
murder attempt last year

07:51.904 --> 07:53.406
jesus fuckin' christ.

07:53.406 --> 07:57.910
How come every piss i take
is a fuckin' news story?

07:58.411 --> 08:00.913
Oh.

08:10.923 --> 08:12.925
Let's walk.

08:12.925 --> 08:14.927
I had coffee with
your friend from the railroad.

08:14.927 --> 08:16.929
Sounds like mag
and custom wheels.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.931
Could be sweet.

08:18.931 --> 08:21.934
I need you to head
out to newark for me.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.436
Airport?

08:23.436 --> 08:24.437
Al italia.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.439
Friend of ours
is coming in.

08:26.939 --> 08:28.441
Who,
mauro zucca's wife?

08:28.441 --> 08:30.943
No, furio.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.445
Furio?

08:32.445 --> 08:33.946
Coming here?

08:33.946 --> 08:35.448
What, to see what indoor
plumbing looks like?

08:35.948 --> 08:41.453
I'm making
some changes.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.456
Well, thanks for
fuckin' tellin' me.

08:43.456 --> 08:44.957
When was this decided?

08:44.957 --> 08:46.959
I do something wrong?

08:46.959 --> 08:51.464
Sunday, my house, box of
mallomars on the counter?

08:51.464 --> 08:53.966
Fuckin' empty.

08:53.966 --> 08:57.470
You think i don't
know it was you?

08:57.470 --> 09:01.974
I'm kiddin', you fuck.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.977
Listen, him coming
over is good, you're
gettin' a bump.

09:05.478 --> 09:08.481
Fuckin' mallomars,
i thought you lost your mind.

09:08.481 --> 09:11.484
Listen, the way things are,
i gotta step back.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.487
Feds find an excuse,
i'll do a dime for jaywalking.

09:14.487 --> 09:15.988
Not like the old days.

09:15.988 --> 09:17.490
Furio being here,

09:17.490 --> 09:19.992
frees you up,
frees me up.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.495
It's me, then you
and sil together.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.996
That's the new
pecking order.

09:23.996 --> 09:25.498
What about puss'?

09:25.498 --> 09:28.000
Pussy reports
to you guys...

09:28.000 --> 09:29.502
directly.

09:29.502 --> 09:36.008
Same with furio.

09:36.008 --> 09:38.511
This means
a lot to me, t.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.012
It was a downpour.

09:40.012 --> 09:41.514
He couldn't see anything.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.516
It was impossible.

09:43.516 --> 09:46.018
Where are you
in the dream?

09:46.018 --> 09:49.021
I'm there.

09:49.021 --> 09:51.023
I could observe
everything.

09:51.524 --> 09:56.028
He's driving, he starts
to hyperventilate.

09:56.028 --> 09:59.532
He grabs for a bottle
of prozac, but it's empty.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.033
And all the while
this is happening

10:01.033 --> 10:04.036
that song from
"the wizard of oz" is playing.

10:04.537 --> 10:05.538
"Over the rainbow".

10:06.038 --> 10:12.545
No, that other one,

10:16.048 --> 10:18.050
they're in
the poppy field.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.555
That one.

10:22.555 --> 10:25.558
Anyway, he goes into
a full- blown panic attack

10:26.058 --> 10:28.561
and he passes out.

10:33.566 --> 10:38.571
He crashes into
this huge truck.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.573
Out of the woods.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.575
The fact that he can't
see the road ahead

10:42.575 --> 10:45.578
suggests my abandoning him.

10:46.078 --> 10:53.085
Who in "wizard" would
your patient be?

10:53.085 --> 10:58.591
Given the fact that he's
a powerful, dominating male...

10:58.591 --> 11:01.594
oz himself.

11:01.594 --> 11:04.096
What, elliot,
with the eyebrows already.

11:04.096 --> 11:07.099
"The wizard of oz",

11:07.099 --> 11:09.101
what memories
does it conjure up?

11:09.101 --> 11:18.110
My parents' house,
watching it on tv.

11:18.110 --> 11:25.618
Hiding under the blanket
with my sister.

11:25.618 --> 11:28.120
I'm gaining weight.

11:34.126 --> 11:36.128
Why do we love
roller coasters, jennifer?

11:36.128 --> 11:38.631
Scary movies?

11:38.631 --> 11:42.635
To experience the thrill
of being terrified

11:42.635 --> 11:45.638
without the consequences.

11:46.138 --> 11:47.640
That's very good, elliot.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.142
Great film, but some
terrifying moments.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.144
That's very perceptive...

11:52.645 --> 11:55.648
i'm concerned that treating
a mobster provides you

11:55.648 --> 11:58.651
some vicarious thrill.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.654
It wasn't
exactly vicarious.

12:01.654 --> 12:04.657
I had to go into hiding,
remember?

12:04.657 --> 12:05.658
And wasn't
that thrilling?

12:05.658 --> 12:07.660
Fuck you!

12:07.660 --> 12:10.663
You think
this is funny?

12:10.663 --> 12:12.665
You smug cocksucker!

12:12.665 --> 12:17.670
Fuck you!

12:38.691 --> 12:40.192
Hello.

12:40.693 --> 12:43.195
Who's this?

12:43.195 --> 12:45.197
She's not here
right now.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.700
This is her brother.

12:47.700 --> 12:52.204
No.

12:52.204 --> 12:54.206
Yeah, that's m
y mother's house.

12:54.206 --> 12:56.208
On the what?

12:56.208 --> 13:01.213
Yeah, i'll give he
r the fuckin' message.

13:01.213 --> 13:03.215
That fuckin' bitch.

13:03.716 --> 13:04.717
What's the matter?

13:04.717 --> 13:06.218
It's a bank.

13:06.218 --> 13:08.220
She's trying to take out a loan
on my mother's house.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.221
Parvati?

13:09.221 --> 13:10.222
Janice.

13:10.222 --> 13:12.224
Her name is
fuckin' janice, okay!

13:12.224 --> 13:14.226
She gave'em the wrong
social security number

13:14.226 --> 13:15.227
or something!

13:15.227 --> 13:16.729
Alright, tony,
calm down.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.230
It's not enough that
she's livin' rent free,

13:18.230 --> 13:25.237
she's gotta try
to squeeze money out of
the fuckin' house, too!

13:25.237 --> 13:29.742
Fucking goddamn
fucking bitch!

13:29.742 --> 13:32.244
Goddamn it, tony!

13:37.750 --> 13:39.251
What did i say, a. J.?

13:39.251 --> 13:41.253
Go get dressed.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.262
I'm sorry.

13:50.262 --> 13:53.265
Why don't you
grow the fuck up?

14:09.782 --> 14:11.283
I forgot to tell you i got
a job with radio shack.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.786
Product testing.

14:13.786 --> 14:16.789
Giving that phone
an "f" for durability.

14:46.318 --> 14:52.825
Janice, it's me,
open the door!

14:52.825 --> 14:55.828
What the fuck
are you doin' here?

14:55.828 --> 14:57.329
Where's my sister?

14:57.830 --> 14:59.832
The store.

15:00.332 --> 15:07.840
I'm making breakfast,
you want some eggs?

15:07.840 --> 15:11.343
Do i want some eggs?

15:11.343 --> 15:15.347
Why don't you put
your fuckin' pants on?

15:15.347 --> 15:17.349
Let's have
some coffee.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.360
So, what the fuck, rich?

15:28.360 --> 15:30.863
The mattress at the shelter
a little too lumpy?

15:30.863 --> 15:33.365
We're adults, tony.

15:33.365 --> 15:35.868
We got history
together.

15:35.868 --> 15:36.869
Yeah.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.370
Israel and fuckin'
palestine.

15:38.370 --> 15:39.371
People change.

15:39.371 --> 15:40.372
I was away a long time.

15:40.372 --> 15:43.375
I thought a lot about her.

15:43.375 --> 15:44.877
Ten years,
you thought about janice?

15:44.877 --> 15:47.880
There are men in the can
better- looking than my sister.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.382
To each his own, tony.

15:50.382 --> 15:55.387
Each his own.

15:55.387 --> 15:58.390
I hope you're not thinkin'
about movin' in here.

15:58.390 --> 16:02.394
It was late,
i slept over.

16:02.394 --> 16:04.396
We're taking
it slow, okay?

16:04.396 --> 16:06.899
Pickin' up where
we left off.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.400
High school.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.903
Grabbin' blow jobs on
my mother's couch.

16:16.408 --> 16:19.912
You crossed the line
on me once, anthony,
and i held my tongue.

16:20.412 --> 16:24.416
She may be your sister
, but back the fuck off.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.418
All due respect.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.921
Respect?

16:28.921 --> 16:30.923
What the fuck do you
know about respect?

16:31.423 --> 16:33.425
I put you back in business,
you cocksucker.

16:33.425 --> 16:34.927
Did you go see beansie?

16:34.927 --> 16:36.929
Fuckin' paraplegic.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.931
Why don't you make him
some fuckin' eggs?

16:38.931 --> 16:41.433
Hello?

16:41.433 --> 16:43.435
Hey, i thought
that was your car--

16:43.936 --> 16:45.938
where do you get the balls to
take a loan on this house?

16:45.938 --> 16:46.939
What?

16:46.939 --> 16:47.940
You heard me!

16:47.940 --> 16:49.441
What is it,
his fuckin' idea?

16:49.441 --> 16:51.443
Like you could
pay it the fuck back!

16:51.443 --> 16:53.445
I'm quite capable of
getting a job, tony.

16:53.445 --> 16:54.947
Yeah, with your
carpel tunnel syndrome?

16:54.947 --> 16:56.448
How you gonna hold
a beggar's cup?

16:56.448 --> 16:58.450
I never begged
a day in my life.

16:58.450 --> 16:59.451
Oh, you're right.

16:59.451 --> 17:00.953
Fake disabilities
don't count.

17:00.953 --> 17:03.455
I applied for the loan
simply because

17:03.455 --> 17:05.958
i'm trying to make
this place habitable for ma.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.459
Oh.

17:07.459 --> 17:08.961
I'll take care
of the loan.

17:08.961 --> 17:12.464
Don't worry about it,
i'll give you the money.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.465
Oh, look at this.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.469
Ozzie and fuckin'
harriet here.

17:17.469 --> 17:19.471
That's beautiful.

17:19.471 --> 17:21.473
Stay as long
as you like, rich.

17:21.473 --> 17:27.479
She's your fuckin'
problem now.

17:27.479 --> 17:29.481
This is a no- stopping zone,
ma'am.

17:29.481 --> 17:31.483
The sign's
right over there.

17:31.483 --> 17:33.485
Oh, i'm sorry,
i didn't see it.

17:33.485 --> 17:36.488
I left my glasses at home.

17:36.488 --> 17:39.491
It says here you're required
to wear them for driving.

17:39.491 --> 17:43.996
Now, into this mix
comes brenda's husband, omar,

17:43.996 --> 17:52.504
who's just leaving the market
with a bag of oranges.

17:52.504 --> 17:55.007
What's the trouble
here, officer?

17:55.007 --> 17:56.508
Your wife's
getting a ticket.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.511
Maybe i can
change your mind.

17:59.511 --> 18:01.513
Whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

18:02.014 --> 18:05.517
You're dropping your
fuckin' oranges.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.520
Very good, chris,
great improv.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.022
There we have it.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.023
Listen.

18:11.523 --> 18:13.525
Any questions?

18:13.525 --> 18:17.029
Okay, then, let's see what
the pros have to teach us.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.530
For next time.

18:19.031 --> 18:21.033
Phil and joanne...

18:21.033 --> 18:27.539
scene two,
"barefoot in the park".

18:27.539 --> 18:30.542
Chris, mitch
and cynthia...

18:30.542 --> 18:35.047
scenes six and seven,
"the glass menagerie".

18:35.047 --> 18:37.049
Chris, you are
the gentleman caller.

18:37.549 --> 18:38.050
Okay.

18:38.550 --> 18:44.056
Bob and amy...

18:55.567 --> 18:56.568
the breast milk,

18:56.568 --> 18:59.071
little each eye.

18:59.571 --> 19:01.073
Nobody
tells me nothing.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.075
Who's the zip
anyway?

19:03.075 --> 19:05.577
He's a friend of ours.

19:05.577 --> 19:08.580
We'll talk later.

19:19.591 --> 19:20.592
What's the matter?

19:20.592 --> 19:23.095
Nothin'.

19:31.103 --> 19:34.606
Come here.

19:34.606 --> 19:36.108
You having a good time?

19:36.108 --> 19:37.109
The food's good, right?

19:37.609 --> 19:38.110
Your home...

19:38.110 --> 19:39.611
this is spectacular.

19:40.112 --> 19:43.115
The television,
the...the...

19:43.115 --> 19:44.616
satellite.

19:44.616 --> 19:46.618
The amc.

19:46.618 --> 19:48.620
"Two women" is on.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.622
La loren.

19:50.622 --> 19:52.624
We don't even show
this in italy.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.626
Nobody care.

19:54.626 --> 19:59.631
Tell'em what your favorite
tv program is.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.634
The p. D. Blue.

20:02.634 --> 20:03.635
Garden state's
a freakin' parking lot.

20:03.635 --> 20:05.637
Oh, look who it is.

20:05.637 --> 20:06.138
Christopher.

20:06.638 --> 20:07.639
How you doing, man?

20:08.140 --> 20:09.141
What the hell
are you doin' here?

20:09.141 --> 20:11.643
I come, tony make
a party for me.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.145
Hey, furio,
come here a second.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.146
I want you to
meet somebody.

20:14.146 --> 20:17.149
Scusa.

20:17.649 --> 20:18.150
What the fuck?

20:18.650 --> 20:19.651
He's on vacation?

20:19.651 --> 20:22.654
Yeah, he saw a travel poster
for sunny new jersey.

20:22.654 --> 20:23.655
He's with us now?

20:23.655 --> 20:25.157
Mmm.

20:25.157 --> 20:26.658
Guess i didn't
get the memo.

20:27.159 --> 20:29.661
Would you've read it
if you got one?

20:29.661 --> 20:31.663
Where the fuck
you been anyway?

20:31.663 --> 20:34.666
Did you talk to that guy
down at the tanning salon?

20:34.666 --> 20:35.667
He only had half.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.669
Again?

20:37.669 --> 20:40.672
Ask me, it's that chinese cunt
he's married to.

20:40.672 --> 20:42.674
Bad influence.

20:42.674 --> 20:43.675
She's a filipino.

20:44.176 --> 20:46.678
I wasn't sure
what you wanted.

20:46.678 --> 20:48.680
I want you to send him
a past- due notice,

20:48.680 --> 20:50.682
what the fuck
do you think i want?

20:50.682 --> 20:56.688
Alright, i'll take
care of it.

20:56.688 --> 21:00.692
You know what,
leave it alone.

21:01.193 --> 21:02.694
You sure?

21:02.694 --> 21:06.198
Yeah.

21:08.700 --> 21:09.701
Carmela.

21:10.202 --> 21:11.703
What do you want?

21:11.703 --> 21:13.705
I brought some cookies,
the pignolis.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.208
Our relative from
the other side is here,

21:16.208 --> 21:17.709
i should pay my resp--

21:23.215 --> 21:25.717
"what did you say,
about glass?"

21:25.717 --> 21:28.220
"Collection i said,
i have one."

21:28.220 --> 21:32.724
"Know what i judge
to be the trouble with you?

21:32.724 --> 21:35.227
"Inferiority complex.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.729
"Know what that is?

21:37.729 --> 21:40.732
"That's what they call it when
someone low- rates himself.

21:40.732 --> 21:42.734
"For instance,

21:42.734 --> 21:46.238
"that clumping you thought
was so awful in high school.

21:46.238 --> 21:49.741
"You gave up your education
for a clump.

21:49.741 --> 21:56.248
A little physical defect
is what you have."

21:56.748 --> 21:58.250
Little physical defect?

21:58.250 --> 21:59.751
She's a fuckin' gimp,
for chrissake.

21:59.751 --> 22:01.253
You were doin' so good.

22:01.253 --> 22:03.255
It doesn't
make any sense.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.256
The guy's a player

22:04.256 --> 22:05.757
and he's trying to
fuck this broad?

22:05.757 --> 22:08.260
Where does it say he is trying
to fuck her, christopher?

22:08.260 --> 22:09.761
Please.

22:09.761 --> 22:11.763
Maybe he is not.

22:11.763 --> 22:14.766
You ever think that's why
he's the gentleman caller?

22:14.766 --> 22:17.269
Maybe he's a gentleman.

22:17.269 --> 22:21.773
He's a douchebag.

22:21.773 --> 22:22.774
So quit.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.276
I'm not gonna quit.

22:24.276 --> 22:25.777
I'll just get
a different scene.

22:25.777 --> 22:29.281
I like you as an actor.

22:29.281 --> 22:31.283
Joe pesci or something.

22:31.283 --> 22:34.786
"This is jericho,
cell leader of the s. O. S.

22:34.786 --> 22:37.789
"Let it be known
from this day forth

22:37.789 --> 22:42.294
that lawlessness will
not be tolerated."

22:42.294 --> 22:45.797
"Jimmy hollywood",
c'mon.

22:45.797 --> 22:48.800
Hey, tony.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.302
I'll just be
a few minutes.

22:50.302 --> 22:53.305
Why don't you fix yourself
a drink or something, okay?

22:53.305 --> 22:55.807
What's up?

22:55.807 --> 23:00.312
A guy named danny greco
called me.

23:00.812 --> 23:01.813
Asked me for a loan.

23:01.813 --> 23:03.315
Said you'll vouch.

23:03.315 --> 23:04.316
Danny?

23:04.316 --> 23:05.317
Yeah.

23:05.817 --> 23:06.318
I told you danny was
good for whatever.

23:06.818 --> 23:07.319
Oh, yeah?

23:07.819 --> 23:08.820
Yeah, at
the steak house.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.322
Oh, yeah, yeah.

23:10.322 --> 23:17.329
Since i'm here, can i talk
to you about something?

23:17.329 --> 23:20.332
It absolutely has to stay
between the two of us.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.343
Alright, on any fuckin' scale
you want to use,

23:31.343 --> 23:33.345
things are going good.

23:33.345 --> 23:35.347
I'm firmly in charge,
no trouble there.

23:35.347 --> 23:36.848
My family's healthy.

23:36.848 --> 23:38.350
Right?

23:38.350 --> 23:40.852
So, why the fuck am i ripping
phones out of the wall

23:40.852 --> 23:42.354
in front of my kid

23:42.354 --> 23:44.356
and screaming at my sister
all the fucking time,

23:44.356 --> 23:46.358
although, she is totally
unimportant to me?

23:46.358 --> 23:47.859
You got a lot
on your mind.

23:47.859 --> 23:49.861
'Cause i'm the boss.

23:49.861 --> 23:53.365
You see, that's the point.

23:53.365 --> 23:55.867
You never saw
carlo or lucky...

23:55.867 --> 23:58.370
or douglas macarthur going
around punching fucking walls.

23:58.370 --> 24:03.875
What if i told you
i went to see a shrink?

24:04.376 --> 24:06.378
I had an inkling.

24:16.388 --> 24:17.889
Every once in
a while, i get...

24:18.390 --> 24:21.393
anxious.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.895
You know,
just in general,
no reason.

24:23.895 --> 24:25.897
It's like,
i'm in my kitchen.

24:25.897 --> 24:27.399
All of a sudden
i can't breathe.

24:27.399 --> 24:29.401
It's like i'm suffocating.

24:29.401 --> 24:30.902
I get to the point
where i fuckin' pass out.

24:31.403 --> 24:32.404
Hmph.

24:32.404 --> 24:34.406
It's just like
your father.

24:34.406 --> 24:34.906
What is?

24:34.906 --> 24:35.907
He had the same thing.

24:36.408 --> 24:37.409
My old man had
anxiety attacks?

24:37.409 --> 24:39.911
Well, in those days
we called it a "condition".

24:39.911 --> 24:42.414
Didn't happen that often,
once or twice a year.

24:42.414 --> 24:43.915
Holy shit.

24:43.915 --> 24:46.918
He cracked his head open once
on a cigarette machine.

24:46.918 --> 24:48.420
Did he go to a doctor?

24:48.420 --> 24:49.921
Your father,
what, are you kidding?

24:49.921 --> 24:51.923
It wouldn't have made
any difference in those days.

24:52.424 --> 24:53.925
They wouldn't know how
to treat that shit.

24:53.925 --> 24:55.927
Not much better now.

24:55.927 --> 24:57.929
There was an article in
"new york times" magazine.

24:57.929 --> 24:59.431
They've got this machine.

24:59.431 --> 25:01.433
It can see images
of the brain

25:01.433 --> 25:03.435
and how your brain
responds to fear.

25:03.435 --> 25:04.936
Fear?

25:04.936 --> 25:07.939
A person listening to a tape
of a parent criticizing them,

25:07.939 --> 25:09.441
i'm talking about an adult,
mind you,

25:09.441 --> 25:11.943
their fear center
kicks right in.

25:11.943 --> 25:14.446
They can actually
see it in an mri.

25:22.454 --> 25:23.955
I had this fuckin' weird dream
the other night.

25:24.456 --> 25:25.457
When i had the polyps,

25:25.457 --> 25:27.459
they put me through
that fuckin' mri.

25:27.459 --> 25:28.960
I'm telling ya.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.462
I think they used my ass
to invent some new tests.

25:30.962 --> 25:32.964
I was at the beach,
but i had a suit on.

25:33.465 --> 25:34.966
And the shoes too.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.969
They shove a camera up your ass
the size of a garden hose.

25:37.969 --> 25:39.471
You wanna hear
this fuckin' dream or not?

25:39.471 --> 25:45.977
Alright.

25:45.977 --> 25:47.979
Got a sec?

25:47.979 --> 25:49.481
Sure, what's up?

25:49.481 --> 25:51.483
It's my scene.

25:51.983 --> 25:53.485
Gentleman- caller guy.

25:53.485 --> 25:55.487
It's...

25:55.487 --> 25:56.488
it's not me.

25:56.488 --> 25:57.989
It's not supposed to be.

25:57.989 --> 25:59.491
That's why they
call it "acting".

25:59.491 --> 26:00.992
I know, it's just...

26:00.992 --> 26:03.495
i'd rather do
something else.

26:03.495 --> 26:05.497
I already spoke to
what's his name?

26:05.497 --> 26:06.998
Mitch. Cynthia, too.

26:06.998 --> 26:08.500
They're cool
with changing.

26:08.500 --> 26:09.501
Alright.

26:09.501 --> 26:11.503
Alan's scene partner
dropped out,

26:11.503 --> 26:15.006
so, i gotta find something
for him anyway...

26:15.006 --> 26:19.511
"rebel without a cause",
james dean.

26:19.511 --> 26:21.012
Copy it for
the others, okay?

26:21.012 --> 26:22.514
Take it home,
get comfortable with it.

26:22.514 --> 26:24.516
That's great, cool.

26:25.016 --> 26:26.518
I don't want
a james dean impression.

26:26.518 --> 26:27.519
Yeah.

26:27.519 --> 26:33.525
No.

26:33.525 --> 26:34.526
Poor ducks.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.027
You are poor creatures.

26:36.027 --> 26:37.529
Poor creatures.

26:38.029 --> 26:44.536
You are such
poor creatures.

26:44.536 --> 26:47.038
Don't give'em
that shit!

26:47.038 --> 26:52.043
They like it.

26:52.043 --> 26:53.044
Hey, what'd i tell you?

26:53.044 --> 26:54.045
He's gonna choke!

26:54.045 --> 26:56.047
Little pieces,
they're hungry.

26:56.047 --> 26:58.550
Not for fuckin'
cheese doodles, they're not.

26:59.050 --> 27:01.052
They eat bread and corn
and shit like that.

27:01.052 --> 27:03.054
So, you know everything.

27:03.054 --> 27:04.556
Yeah, i do.

27:04.556 --> 27:07.559
Family of mallards lived in
my pool for two fuckin' months.

27:15.066 --> 27:16.568
Yeah, you.

27:28.580 --> 27:29.581
What'd he say?

27:29.581 --> 27:31.082
Nothing.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.585
A lot of fucking words
for nothing.

27:33.585 --> 27:35.086
He said,"if i don't
like to fight,

27:35.086 --> 27:40.592
i should find
myself a russian."

27:40.592 --> 27:43.094
Tony, no!

27:43.094 --> 27:45.096
You got a problem
besides those fuckin' pants?

27:45.096 --> 27:46.097
You shouldn't yell.

27:46.097 --> 27:47.599
Oh, yeah?

27:47.599 --> 27:49.100
You should mind
your own fuckin' business.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.102
I make business,
she is nice girl.

27:51.102 --> 27:52.604
Are you
a family counselor?

27:52.604 --> 27:53.605
You wanna get involved
in people's problems?

27:54.105 --> 27:56.107
Here, now you're
fuckin' involved, okay?

27:56.107 --> 27:59.110
These are balls, right?

27:59.110 --> 28:00.111
Yes.

28:00.111 --> 28:01.112
Do something.

28:01.613 --> 28:03.114
You want to be involved,
now you're involved.

28:03.114 --> 28:04.616
You let go!

28:05.116 --> 28:06.117
I call police!

28:06.117 --> 28:07.619
Mind your
fuckin' business!

28:07.619 --> 28:09.120
Fuck you!

28:09.120 --> 28:10.622
I call police!

28:10.622 --> 28:12.123
Fuck you!

28:30.642 --> 28:32.644
Fuck!

28:32.644 --> 28:34.646
Get your shit,
we're going.

28:34.646 --> 28:40.151
C'mon.

28:40.151 --> 28:42.153
Move your ass!

28:47.158 --> 28:49.661
Why do you always have
to ruin everything?

28:49.661 --> 28:50.662
Huh?

28:50.662 --> 28:55.667
Just move your ass.

28:55.667 --> 28:56.167
"Help me.

28:56.167 --> 28:58.169
"Daddy.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.171
Daddy."

29:00.171 --> 29:01.673
"You can depend on me.

29:01.673 --> 29:02.674
"Trust me.

29:02.674 --> 29:10.181
Whatever comes,
we'll face it together."

29:10.181 --> 29:11.683
Oh, fuck this shit!

29:11.683 --> 29:16.688
You said you weren't
gonna laugh.

29:16.688 --> 29:18.189
I didn't laugh.

29:18.189 --> 29:20.692
Baby, you were
doin' so good.

29:20.692 --> 29:23.695
Nah, fuck this.

29:23.695 --> 29:27.198
Christopher.

29:31.703 --> 29:32.704
Absolutely not.

29:32.704 --> 29:34.205
Just do the work
you were assigned.

29:34.205 --> 29:35.707
Well, how about the scene
where i'm playing chicken

29:35.707 --> 29:37.208
and i dive out of the car

29:37.208 --> 29:39.711
right before that asshole,
buzz, goes off the cliff?

29:39.711 --> 29:41.713
There's no dialogue
in that scene.

29:41.713 --> 29:43.214
The knife fight, then.

29:43.214 --> 29:44.215
No.

29:44.215 --> 29:45.216
I already changed it once.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.719
I gave you this scene
because it's challenging.

29:47.719 --> 29:50.221
This russian fuck...

29:50.221 --> 29:52.724
i'm friggin' lucky
i didn't get hauled in.

29:52.724 --> 29:54.726
That would've played great
with uncle junior

29:54.726 --> 29:56.227
and everybody else
after my ass.

29:56.728 --> 29:59.731
I had to run like a bitch from
my own leisure- time activities.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.733
Mmm.

30:01.733 --> 30:04.235
If carmela would've known
who i was on the boat with...

30:04.235 --> 30:05.737
okay, that's nothing new.

30:05.737 --> 30:08.239
But my kids...?

30:08.239 --> 30:09.741
It happens, okay?

30:09.741 --> 30:13.745
What the fuck
is wrong with me?

30:13.745 --> 30:15.747
Got some kind of a complex.

30:15.747 --> 30:16.748
What kind?

30:16.748 --> 30:18.750
Sleep always helps.

30:18.750 --> 30:19.751
You want to go to sleep,
go ahead!

30:19.751 --> 30:20.752
Hey.

30:20.752 --> 30:21.753
Jesus christ.

30:22.253 --> 30:26.758
Easy does it, laddy buck.

30:27.258 --> 30:29.260
You know, i was never
particularly
good with my fists,

30:29.260 --> 30:32.263
but there was one guy who
almost drove me to murder.

30:32.263 --> 30:33.264
Lately, i feel this...

30:33.765 --> 30:36.768
aversion to
my swimming pool.

30:36.768 --> 30:38.269
It depresses me.

30:38.770 --> 30:40.772
Cocksucker was a sound engineer
at one of my studios.

30:40.772 --> 30:42.774
Talked about
germany all the time.

30:42.774 --> 30:44.275
I actually find myself
avoiding the backyard.

30:44.776 --> 30:47.278
He wasn't a nazi, he just kind
of rubbed me the wrong way.

30:47.278 --> 30:49.280
One time, i was pulling
into a parking lot.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.282
He was two spots over

30:51.282 --> 30:53.284
and he was rotating his tires

30:53.284 --> 30:56.287
like it was a goddamn
service station...

30:56.287 --> 30:59.791
so i said to him...

30:59.791 --> 31:05.296
"straight back, back as far
as they could take me.

31:05.797 --> 31:09.801
"And then it all dissolved.

31:09.801 --> 31:13.805
Everything dissolved."

31:13.805 --> 31:15.306
That's it,
that's the end.

31:15.306 --> 31:18.810
Very good, omar.

31:18.810 --> 31:22.313
And just say,"scene"
when you're done, okay?

31:22.313 --> 31:30.321
Chris, mitch, cynthia and alan,
our rebels without causes.

31:30.321 --> 31:32.323
Okay, so, we are
at the planetarium.

31:32.323 --> 31:36.828
Alan is jim's friend, plato,
who is about to get

31:36.828 --> 31:38.830
mistakenly shot by
the police.

31:38.830 --> 31:43.835
Mitch is his father and cynthia
is his troubled friend, judy.

31:49.340 --> 31:51.342
Shut the lights!

31:51.342 --> 31:52.844
Make them go away!

31:52.844 --> 31:53.845
Plato!

31:53.845 --> 31:54.846
Keep away from me!

31:54.846 --> 31:56.347
I don't believe
you anymore!

31:56.347 --> 31:57.348
Gunshot!

31:57.348 --> 31:59.350
Jim!

31:59.350 --> 32:01.352
I got the bullets!

32:01.352 --> 32:04.355
Look!

32:04.355 --> 32:05.356
Oh, god!

32:05.857 --> 32:07.358
The cops swarm in...

32:07.358 --> 32:08.860
let him alone,
that's my son.

32:08.860 --> 32:13.364
When i saw the red jacket,
i thought...

32:13.364 --> 32:15.366
hey, jerkpot.

32:15.366 --> 32:17.368
What'd you do that for?

32:17.368 --> 32:18.369
You can't help it, son.

32:18.369 --> 32:20.872
You did everything
a man could.

32:27.879 --> 32:29.380
Help me, daddy.

32:29.881 --> 32:33.384
Daddy, help me.

32:33.384 --> 32:35.887
Daddy.

32:36.387 --> 32:37.388
You can depend on me.

32:37.388 --> 32:38.890
Trust me.

32:38.890 --> 32:41.893
Whatever comes,
we'll face it together.

32:41.893 --> 32:47.899
It's okay, jim, stand up.

32:48.399 --> 32:49.901
I'll stand up with you.

32:49.901 --> 32:54.405
I'll try and be as strong
as you want me to be.

32:54.405 --> 32:55.907
Poor baby got nobody.

32:55.907 --> 32:58.910
Just nobody.

33:11.422 --> 33:14.425
He was always cold.

33:27.939 --> 33:30.441
Dad, this is judy.

33:30.441 --> 33:32.443
She's my friend.

33:32.443 --> 33:36.447
Scene.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.950
Un- freaking- believable!

33:38.950 --> 33:40.952
God, you were
really good.

33:40.952 --> 33:45.957
Great job, chris.

33:45.957 --> 33:48.459
How'd you make yourself
cry like that?

34:09.480 --> 34:12.483
You wanna watch
your ashes, please.

34:19.489 --> 34:23.494
I be outside.

34:23.494 --> 34:25.496
You know, we should hit
a devil's game some night.

34:25.996 --> 34:27.498
Still get tickets
from the greek?

34:27.498 --> 34:29.500
Right on the fuckin' ice.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.002
I'll bring my sweater.

34:31.502 --> 34:37.507
Hey, chef of the future,
have a seat.

34:37.507 --> 34:39.010
How you doin', foodio?

34:39.010 --> 34:46.516
Furio.

34:46.516 --> 34:52.023
You didn't stomp those grapes
yourself, did you?

34:52.523 --> 34:54.025
Look at this group.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.527
Hey, mr. New york.

34:56.527 --> 34:58.529
What'd you do,
swim across that river?

34:58.529 --> 34:59.530
Come over here, you.

35:00.031 --> 35:00.531
Congratulations.

35:00.531 --> 35:04.035
Thanks.

35:04.035 --> 35:05.536
Don't get up.

35:05.536 --> 35:07.038
I wasn't gonna.

35:07.038 --> 35:08.539
You piece of shit.

35:08.539 --> 35:13.544
Say hello to furio, friend of
ours from the other side.

35:13.544 --> 35:17.048
Oh, hey, i heard
a lot about you.

35:17.548 --> 35:19.050
Nice to meet you.

35:19.550 --> 35:21.052
Yeah, me too,
my pleasure.

35:26.557 --> 35:34.065
So, what's up?

35:34.065 --> 35:37.068
Puss, you wanna
give us a minute?

35:44.075 --> 35:46.077
I'm in the middle
of fuckin' eatin'.

35:46.077 --> 35:47.078
I know...

35:47.078 --> 35:49.580
do me a favor,
will you, sweetie?

35:50.081 --> 35:52.583
Keep this warm.

35:52.583 --> 35:54.585
Thank you.

35:54.585 --> 35:57.088
Five minutes,
alright?

36:02.593 --> 36:04.595
I gotta make
a call anyway.

36:11.102 --> 36:12.603
It's like all these years
were for nothing.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.105
What'd i tell you?

36:14.105 --> 36:16.107
You think tony really gives
a flyin' fuck about you?

36:16.107 --> 36:17.108
This thing of ours.

36:17.108 --> 36:18.109
Fuckin' joke.

36:18.609 --> 36:19.610
More like,
"this thing of mine".

36:19.610 --> 36:20.611
It's the same all over.

36:20.611 --> 36:21.612
Look out for number one.

36:22.113 --> 36:23.614
You don't understand,
we go fuckin' back.

36:24.115 --> 36:26.117
I mean, silvio, i get,
but fuckin' paulie?

36:26.117 --> 36:28.119
He's probably dizzy from
all that hair spray.

36:28.119 --> 36:29.620
And this other one,
the geep.

36:29.620 --> 36:31.622
Foodio,
furio.

36:31.622 --> 36:33.124
If ever there was a guy
in desperate need

36:33.124 --> 36:34.625
of a fuckin' nickname.

36:34.625 --> 36:35.626
At least he's italian.

36:35.626 --> 36:37.128
Try being passed over
for a samoan.

36:37.128 --> 36:38.629
Sesaga.

36:38.629 --> 36:40.631
Three years out of quantico,
he's the new agent in charge.

36:41.132 --> 36:42.633
You're fuckin' kiddin' me,
what happened to paterno?

36:42.633 --> 36:43.634
Kansas city.

36:43.634 --> 36:46.137
11 years doing this shit.

36:46.137 --> 36:47.638
It's like tony
says himself,

36:48.139 --> 36:51.142
"most of the guys in this life,
there's no fuckin' honor."

36:51.142 --> 36:53.644
Forget your enemies, you can't
even depend on your friends.

36:54.145 --> 36:55.646
Whole society's fucked.

36:55.646 --> 36:56.647
And the ones comin' up?

36:57.148 --> 36:58.649
Half of them are on drugs,

36:58.649 --> 37:00.151
the other half are
fuckin' psychos.

37:00.651 --> 37:07.658
A world full of scumbags.

37:08.159 --> 37:10.161
I'm thinking about
taking my patient back.

37:10.161 --> 37:14.165
That's a serious decision.

37:14.165 --> 37:16.667
He's my responsibility.

37:16.667 --> 37:19.670
Elliot, i abandoned him.

37:19.670 --> 37:21.672
We've been over this.

37:21.672 --> 37:23.174
Your life is in danger.

37:23.174 --> 37:26.177
Not any more.

37:26.177 --> 37:30.181
Do you realize what
i did last week?

37:30.181 --> 37:32.683
I stormed out of here
like a child.

37:32.683 --> 37:35.186
Cursing, threatening,
acting out.

37:35.686 --> 37:42.693
That's exactly
what he does to me.

37:42.693 --> 37:45.196
I'm feeling so...

37:55.706 --> 38:03.214
fuck, i don't know where
this is coming from.

38:03.214 --> 38:11.722
You mentioned you've put
on a little weight lately.

38:11.722 --> 38:13.224
Do you think the over- eating

38:13.224 --> 38:18.729
has anything to do
with your patient?

38:19.230 --> 38:20.731
What is it you're not
telling me, jennifer?

38:20.731 --> 38:23.734
I don't know.

38:23.734 --> 38:29.740
I don't know
what you mean.

38:30.241 --> 38:31.242
Okay.

38:31.242 --> 38:33.744
I don't.

38:34.245 --> 38:35.746
What are you driving at?

38:35.746 --> 38:38.749
Just watch your
intake of sugar...

38:38.749 --> 38:45.256
and sugar substitutes.

38:45.256 --> 38:48.259
Okay.

38:48.259 --> 38:52.263
We spoke last time
about childhood fascinations

38:52.263 --> 38:53.764
with danger.

38:53.764 --> 38:59.270
I think seeing him again will
be very therapeutic for me.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.272
It's not supposed to be
therapeutic for you.

39:01.272 --> 39:06.777
This is your therapy, here.

39:07.278 --> 39:10.281
Do you have sexual
feelings for him?

39:16.787 --> 39:18.789
No.

39:18.789 --> 39:23.294
I have feelings,
on a personal level.

39:23.294 --> 39:27.798
He can be such
a little boy sometimes.

39:27.798 --> 39:30.301
Alright, that's it,
the one with the palm tree.

39:30.301 --> 39:33.804
There's a buzzer
under the desk, an
office in the back.

39:36.307 --> 39:38.809
Tell me again
what i said.

39:38.809 --> 39:41.312
It's not just dominic
who is the problem.

39:41.312 --> 39:48.819
It's the wife, too.

39:48.819 --> 39:50.321
Here.

40:10.841 --> 40:12.843
May i help you?

40:12.843 --> 40:13.844
Ah, what are you doing?

40:16.347 --> 40:18.349
Stop, stop!

40:18.849 --> 40:20.351
Ah!

40:47.878 --> 40:48.379
No!

40:48.379 --> 40:51.882
Oh!

40:58.889 --> 41:00.891
Please stop!

41:00.891 --> 41:01.892
Goddamn you!

41:01.892 --> 41:05.896
Sonofabitch!

41:05.896 --> 41:10.901
Cocksucker!

41:10.901 --> 41:15.406
Go, goddamn!

41:15.406 --> 41:17.408
You go!

41:17.408 --> 41:19.410
We pay money!

41:39.430 --> 41:41.432
God...damn!

41:41.932 --> 41:46.437
Sonofa...bitch!

41:50.941 --> 41:52.443
Yeah?

41:52.443 --> 41:58.449
It's dr. Melfi.

41:58.949 --> 42:01.452
Yeah, so.

42:01.952 --> 42:04.455
I tried your
other number.

42:12.963 --> 42:16.967
If you want, i could fit
you in tomorrow at 2:30.

42:23.474 --> 42:24.975
So, do i put you down?

42:25.476 --> 42:26.977
Nah, fuck it.

42:27.478 --> 42:29.480
Why do you say that?

42:29.480 --> 42:31.982
Gettin' by without it.

42:31.982 --> 42:34.985
There's no cure
for life.

42:34.985 --> 42:37.488
Well...

42:37.988 --> 42:41.992
you think about it.

42:41.992 --> 42:43.494
I'll keep
the hour open.

42:43.494 --> 42:44.495
Yeah.

42:57.007 --> 42:58.008
"A".

42:58.008 --> 42:59.009
"B".

42:59.009 --> 43:01.512
"A"!

43:02.012 --> 43:04.014
"B".

43:04.515 --> 43:05.516
"A".

43:05.516 --> 43:06.517
"B".

43:06.517 --> 43:08.018
Outstanding.

43:08.018 --> 43:10.521
A case in point.

43:10.521 --> 43:12.523
Words are only words.

43:12.523 --> 43:15.025
You just saw two actors
have an entire conversation

43:15.526 --> 43:19.029
saying only "a"
and the other responding "b".

43:19.029 --> 43:21.031
Mitch, christopher?

43:21.031 --> 43:22.533
Want to give it a try?

43:35.045 --> 43:38.549
"A".

43:38.549 --> 43:41.051
Stop it!

43:41.051 --> 43:42.052
Christopher!

43:42.052 --> 43:43.554
This is inappropriate!

43:43.554 --> 43:50.561
We do not hit!

43:50.561 --> 43:51.061
Oh, my god...

43:51.562 --> 43:52.062
jesus!

43:52.062 --> 43:53.564
Are you okay?

43:53.564 --> 43:58.068
Are you alright?

43:58.068 --> 43:59.570
Ah!

43:59.570 --> 44:02.573
Oh, my god, sorry...

44:02.573 --> 44:04.575
i think it's broken.

44:05.075 --> 44:06.076
We should get
you to a doctor.

44:06.577 --> 44:08.078
There's nothing they can
do for a broken toe.

44:08.078 --> 44:09.580
They just tape it up
and send you home.

44:09.580 --> 44:11.081
I've been there.

44:11.081 --> 44:13.584
Babe, i don't understand,
the guy didn't say anything?

44:13.584 --> 44:15.085
He didn't have to,

44:15.085 --> 44:17.087
that was the point of
the whole fuckin' exercise.

44:17.087 --> 44:19.590
But he didn't flip you off
or nothing.

44:19.590 --> 44:21.592
You said so yourself.

44:21.592 --> 44:26.597
Maybe doing that scene
brought up some bad feelings.

44:26.597 --> 44:28.098
What scene?

44:28.098 --> 44:30.100
You know, where he was
supposed to be your father.

44:30.100 --> 44:32.102
You said the class all
clapped and everything.

44:32.102 --> 44:33.604
I was fuckin' acting.

44:33.604 --> 44:35.606
I was better than mitch,
that's all.

44:35.606 --> 44:37.107
Even i knew that.

44:37.107 --> 44:39.610
Maybe he really reminded
you of your father

44:40.110 --> 44:41.612
and that's why you
got so into it.

44:41.612 --> 44:43.614
And maybe that's why you
hit him tonight.

44:44.114 --> 44:45.115
My father?

44:45.616 --> 44:47.618
All those feelings you hav
e about how he died so young.

44:47.618 --> 44:49.119
Oh, fuck that.

44:49.119 --> 44:51.622
Acting is
mostly feelings...

44:51.622 --> 44:54.625
unless the actor's
driving a car,

44:54.625 --> 44:56.627
sword- fighting
or something.

44:56.627 --> 44:57.628
You want to write?

44:57.628 --> 44:59.630
Feelings is what
it's all about.

44:59.630 --> 45:01.131
Revealing
your innermost feelings

45:01.131 --> 45:02.633
is the best
kind of writing.

45:03.133 --> 45:05.135
And how do you know
what it's all about, huh?

45:05.135 --> 45:08.639
From writing down orders
at the fuckin' restaurant?

45:08.639 --> 45:09.640
Ow!

45:10.140 --> 45:11.141
Alright, take it easy!

45:11.141 --> 45:13.143
Your whole thing
with script- writing,

45:13.143 --> 45:14.144
who else is behind you?

45:14.144 --> 45:15.646
Who even knows about it?

45:16.146 --> 45:18.649
I hated seeing you suffer
with that writer's block.

45:18.649 --> 45:21.151
When i read the
ad in the paper,
"acting for writers",

45:21.151 --> 45:23.654
i couldn't wait to get it
for you for your birthday.

45:23.654 --> 45:25.155
I'm sorry.

45:25.155 --> 45:29.660
Adriana, i'm sorry!

46:10.200 --> 46:14.705
Are you still taking
your medication?

46:14.705 --> 46:20.210
Off and on.

46:20.210 --> 46:24.715
Well, you should
either take it
or don't take it, okay?

46:33.223 --> 46:35.225
In the coffee shop,

46:35.225 --> 46:37.728
you mentioned that
you had a panic attack

46:37.728 --> 46:39.229
that led to
an automobile accident.

46:39.730 --> 46:42.232
That seems like years ago.

46:42.232 --> 46:44.234
You mean, you're so busy,

46:44.234 --> 46:47.237
or you mean that
you're angry with me

46:47.237 --> 46:50.741
for not agreeing to
treat you then?

47:01.752 --> 47:04.254
I found out a little
medical history.

47:04.254 --> 47:07.257
My old man had
the same thing.

47:07.257 --> 47:10.260
Panic attacks followed
by passin' out.

47:10.260 --> 47:12.763
Cracked his head open
on a cigarette machine.

47:12.763 --> 47:13.764
Interesting.

47:14.264 --> 47:15.265
Interesting?

47:15.265 --> 47:17.267
That's it?

47:17.267 --> 47:19.770
You're not gonna send me for
fuckin' tests or something?

47:20.270 --> 47:21.772
Did you read the article
in "the times"?

47:21.772 --> 47:29.780
Anthony, what is it
you want to achieve here?

47:30.280 --> 47:36.286
What i want to achieve?

47:36.286 --> 47:37.287
I wanna stop passin' out.

47:37.788 --> 47:39.790
I wanna stop
fuckin' panicking.

47:39.790 --> 47:45.295
I want to direct my power
and my fuckin' anger

47:45.796 --> 47:52.302
against the people in
my life that deserve it.

47:52.803 --> 47:53.804
I wanna be in
total control.

47:53.804 --> 47:56.306
There's no such thing
as total control.

47:56.306 --> 47:57.808
Of course there is.

47:57.808 --> 47:58.809
You want to be
a better gang leader,

47:59.309 --> 48:01.311
read "the art of war"
by sun zu.

48:01.311 --> 48:02.312
You know what?

48:02.312 --> 48:04.314
Fuck you.

48:04.314 --> 48:07.317
You know who i am
and you know what i do.

48:07.818 --> 48:14.324
You called me.

48:14.324 --> 48:19.830
You know where i was
yesterday when you called?

48:20.330 --> 48:21.832
I was outside
a whorehouse

48:21.832 --> 48:24.334
while the guy that
works for me was inside

48:24.334 --> 48:26.336
beating the shit out of a guy
that owes me money.

48:26.837 --> 48:31.842
Broke his arm,
put a bullet in his kneecap.

48:37.848 --> 48:39.349
How'd that
make you feel?

48:39.850 --> 48:41.852
I wished it
was me in there.

48:42.352 --> 48:44.855
Giving the beating
or taking it?
