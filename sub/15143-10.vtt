07:33.250 --> 07:36.750
IN THE DOWNSTAIRS TOILET,

07:36.792 --> 07:38.583
AND DIDN'T REMEMBER TO FLUSH.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.792
WHICH ONE OF YOU WAS IT?

07:39.834 --> 07:42.750
all: IT WASN'T ME!

07:42.792 --> 07:44.417
- HERE WE GO AGAIN.

07:44.458 --> 07:45.667
NOBODY DID IT?

07:45.709 --> 07:47.959
- GUYS, COME ON.

07:45.709 --> 07:47.959
WHOEVER DID IT, JUST SAY IT.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.959
- BUT I DIDN'T DO IT.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.959
- ME NEITHER.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.166
- HEY,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.166
YOU KNOW I LABEL EVERYTHING.

07:52.208 --> 07:54.125
- THAT'S IT, WE ARE NOT GOING

07:52.208 --> 07:54.125
TO THE WATER PARK

07:54.166 --> 07:56.083
UNTIL SOMEONE

07:54.166 --> 07:56.083
TAKES RESPONSIBILITY.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.875
all: YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

07:56.125 --> 07:57.875
IT'S NOT FAIR.

07:57.917 --> 07:59.458
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

07:59.500 --> 08:03.667
NOBODY IS LEAVING THIS HOUSE

07:59.500 --> 08:03.667
UNTIL WE FIND OUT WHO DUNNIT.

08:03.709 --> 08:07.041
- OR SHOULD WE SAY "POO DUNNIT?"

08:07.083 --> 08:11.250
DUN, DUN, DUN!

08:11.291 --> 08:13.000
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?

08:11.291 --> 08:13.000
- IT'S FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT.

08:13.041 --> 08:13.917
DUN, DUN, DUN!

08:29.375 --> 08:30.125
- QUADDLE UP.

08:30.166 --> 08:31.542
THIS IS A QUADMERGENCY.

08:31.583 --> 08:35.041
WHOEVER DID IT,

08:31.583 --> 08:35.041
JUST CONFESS SO WE CAN GO.

08:35.083 --> 08:36.959
- IT WASN'T ME.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.291
- SOMEONE JUST ADMIT

08:37.000 --> 08:40.291
BEING THE QUAD WITH THE LOG.

08:40.333 --> 08:42.166
- YEAH, I WANT TO GO

08:40.333 --> 08:42.166
TO THE WATER PARK.

08:42.208 --> 08:45.250
- ME TOO.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.583
SO, THIS IS

08:45.291 --> 08:47.583
WHAT A QUADDLE'S LIKE, HUH?

08:47.625 --> 08:49.750
- DAD, GET OUT OF THE QUADDLE.

08:49.792 --> 08:55.208
- WHAT?

08:49.792 --> 08:55.208
HE'S HERE.

08:55.250 --> 08:58.166
- BOTH OF YOU GET OUT.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.750
- FINE.

08:59.792 --> 09:02.875
- AND WHY DO YOU SMELL

08:59.792 --> 09:02.875
LIKE BACON?

09:02.917 --> 09:04.750
- LET'S JUST SAY

09:02.917 --> 09:04.750
I'M IN PEAK SLIDING CONDITION.

09:04.792 --> 09:08.959
THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.125
- LOOK, I KNOW IT WASN'T ME,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.125
WHICH MEANS IT WAS ONE OF YOU.

09:12.166 --> 09:14.500
- THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY

09:12.166 --> 09:14.500
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

09:14.542 --> 09:17.625
- WE ALL PROVIDE A SAMPLE AND

09:14.542 --> 09:17.625
SEE IF WE HAVE A MATCH?

09:17.667 --> 09:19.500
both: NO.

09:19.542 --> 09:22.291
- WE GET A SKETCH ARTIST

09:19.542 --> 09:22.291
TO DRAW IT AND SEE

09:19.542 --> 09:22.291
IF IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OF US?

09:22.333 --> 09:24.208
all: NO!

09:24.250 --> 09:27.750
- WE GO IN THERE AND PLAY

09:24.250 --> 09:27.750
GOOD PLOP, BAD PLOP, AND TRY TO

09:24.250 --> 09:27.750
GET IT TO TALK.

09:27.792 --> 09:29.875
all: NO!

09:29.917 --> 09:31.709
- WE JUST NEED TO INVESTIGATE.

09:31.750 --> 09:34.166
GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.041
TO THE SEAT OF THE CRIME!

09:39.667 --> 09:43.542
- THAT IS NOT MINE.

09:43.583 --> 09:48.625
- IF YOU TURN YOUR HEAD, IT

09:43.583 --> 09:48.625
KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A FLAMINGO.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.333
all: OH, YEAH.

09:50.375 --> 09:52.333
- I SEE IT.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.083
THERE'S THE LEG.

09:54.125 --> 09:58.375
- NOW I KIND OF WISH

09:54.125 --> 09:58.375
IT WAS MINE.

09:58.417 --> 10:01.041
- IS IT WEIRD WE'RE ALL LOOKING

09:58.417 --> 10:01.041
AT THIS RIGHT NOW?

10:01.083 --> 10:02.000
all: YEAH, TOTALLY.

10:02.041 --> 10:04.625
- WE SHOULD STOP.

10:04.667 --> 10:05.625
- STOP RIGHT THERE.

10:05.667 --> 10:08.583
THIS IS A CRIME SCENE.

10:08.625 --> 10:11.583
NOBODY TOUCH ANYTHING.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.250
HIDDEN IN THIS ROOM

10:13.291 --> 10:17.542
IS EVIDENCE THAT WILL LEAD US

10:13.291 --> 10:17.542
TO THE POOPETRATOR,

10:17.583 --> 10:20.291
AND I'M GONNA FIND IT

10:17.583 --> 10:20.291
WITH MY GOOD FRIEND...

10:20.333 --> 10:23.625
SCIENCE.

10:23.667 --> 10:27.875
- A MAGNIFYING GLASS?

10:27.917 --> 10:30.125
CUTE.

10:30.166 --> 10:33.083
A TRUE DETECTIVE RELIES

10:30.166 --> 10:33.083
ON ONLY HIS WIT AND KEEN EYE.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.959
YOU DISGUST ME!

10:56.000 --> 10:59.792
- WHILE YOU GUYS WASTE OUR TIME

10:56.000 --> 10:59.792
WITH SCIENCE AND OBSERVATION,

10:59.834 --> 11:01.625
I'M GONNA SOLVE

10:59.834 --> 11:01.625
THIS THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

11:01.667 --> 11:04.792
WE ALL KNOW YOU DID IT, DICKY.

11:04.834 --> 11:07.583
- TAKE IT EASY,

11:04.834 --> 11:07.583
YOU KNOW I'M THINNING.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.667
- ADMIT IT,

11:07.625 --> 11:09.667
OR I'LL START PLUCKING.

11:09.709 --> 11:10.458
- IT WASN'T ME!

11:10.500 --> 11:11.375
- YES IT WAS,

11:11.417 --> 11:13.709
AND I CAN PROVE IT.

11:11.417 --> 11:13.709
- OW!

11:13.750 --> 11:15.375
- I FOUND THIS HAIR

11:13.750 --> 11:15.375
BY THE TOILET,

11:15.417 --> 11:19.208
AND...

11:19.250 --> 11:23.583
THE HAIR I JUST PULLED FROM

11:19.250 --> 11:23.583
YOUR HEAD IS A PERFECT MATCH.

11:23.625 --> 11:28.000
THIS HAIR IS A CLUE

11:23.625 --> 11:28.000
THAT THE POO IS FROM YOU.

11:28.041 --> 11:30.750
- WHAT'S THAT WEIRD GREEN STUFF

11:28.041 --> 11:30.750
ON THE END OF IT?

11:30.792 --> 11:33.792
- THAT'S NOTHING, AND THIS HAIR

11:30.792 --> 11:33.792
DOESN'T PROVE THAT I DID IT.

11:33.834 --> 11:38.125
IT PROVES THAT RICKY DID IT.

11:38.166 --> 11:39.458
- WHAT?

11:39.500 --> 11:41.917
- IT'S THE FIRST RULE

11:39.500 --> 11:41.917
OF DETECTIVING.

11:41.959 --> 11:46.291
THE FIRST TO POINT THE FINGER

11:41.959 --> 11:46.291
IS THE ONE WHO LET IT LINGER.

11:46.333 --> 11:49.375
- YEAH, THE FIRST

11:46.333 --> 11:49.375
TO ISSUE THE CHARGE IS THE ONE

11:49.417 --> 11:51.875
WHO FLOATED THE BARGE.

11:51.917 --> 11:54.583
- THE FIRST TO OPEN HIS YAP

11:54.625 --> 11:59.875
IS THE ONE WHO TOOK

11:54.625 --> 11:59.875
THE WATER PARK AWAY FROM US.

11:59.917 --> 12:01.792
- DAWN POINTED THE FINGER FIRST!

11:59.917 --> 12:01.792
- YEAH.

12:01.834 --> 12:03.667
- THAT'S TRUE.

12:03.709 --> 12:06.458
- DON'T FALL

12:03.709 --> 12:06.458
FOR HIS FANCY LOGIC.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.083
RICKY DID IT,

12:08.125 --> 12:12.792
AND IF WE RETRACE HIS STEPS,

12:08.125 --> 12:12.792
WE CAN PROVE IT.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.291
- DOH-DEE-DOH-DEE-DOH.

12:14.333 --> 12:18.917
JUST GOING IN THE POTTY

12:14.333 --> 12:18.917
TO DO MY BUSINESS,

12:18.959 --> 12:21.834
AND PLAY

12:18.959 --> 12:21.834
MY CROSSWORD PUZZLE GAME.

12:21.875 --> 12:26.375
WHEE! DON-DEE-DOH-DEE-DOH.

12:26.417 --> 12:30.583
WHEN HAVE I EVER DOH-DEE-DOH'ED?

12:30.625 --> 12:33.542
- I'M TELLING THE STORY HERE.

12:33.583 --> 12:34.917
SO, AFTER THE CRIME

12:33.583 --> 12:34.917
WAS COMMITTED,

12:34.959 --> 12:39.250
RICKY HAD A LOT ON HIS MIND.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.417
- GOLLY GEE!

12:41.458 --> 12:44.041
THAT CROSSWORD PUZZLE

12:41.458 --> 12:44.041
WAS SO HARD,

12:44.083 --> 12:48.375
I FORGOT TO FLUSH THE TOILET.

12:48.417 --> 12:53.000
OH WELL, THEY WON'T BE ABLE

12:48.417 --> 12:53.000
TO PIN IT ON ME,

12:53.041 --> 12:56.208
BECAUSE I'M MR. SMARTY-PANTS.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.667
- BUT THEN, HE AND HIS SMART

12:56.250 --> 12:58.667
PANTS PAUSED AT THE DOOR,

12:58.709 --> 13:02.250
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW RICKY WON'T

12:58.709 --> 13:02.250
TOUCH THE BATHROOM DOORKNOB.

13:10.500 --> 13:14.208
OH, AND WHAT'S THIS?

13:14.250 --> 13:18.792
A CHIP IN THE TILE, RIGHT

13:14.250 --> 13:18.792
WHERE RICKY DROPPED THE TABLET.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.291
- HOW DO YOU KNOW

13:18.834 --> 13:20.291
I MADE THAT CHIP?

13:20.333 --> 13:21.709
ANYONE COULD'VE MADE THAT CHIP.

13:21.750 --> 13:24.417
YOU CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING

13:21.750 --> 13:24.417
WITH THAT CHIP!

13:24.458 --> 13:28.333
- YOU'RE RIGHT,

13:24.458 --> 13:28.333
BUT I CAN WITH THIS!

13:33.333 --> 13:36.375
- OH, IT'S ONE OF YOUR LABELS.

13:33.333 --> 13:36.375
IT MUST'VE COME OF WHEN

13:36.417 --> 13:38.291
YOU GRABBED THE DOORKNOB

13:36.417 --> 13:38.291
WITH YOUR SHIRT.

13:38.333 --> 13:40.625
- BET YOU WISH YOU DIDN'T

13:38.333 --> 13:40.625
LABEL EVERYTHING NOW, HUH?

13:40.667 --> 13:42.625
- YOU'RE THE POOPETRATOR.

13:42.667 --> 13:48.500
- AND THIS EVIDENCE

13:42.667 --> 13:48.500
IS GONNA STICK.

13:48.542 --> 13:50.333
- FINALLY, MYSTERY SOLVED!

13:50.375 --> 13:52.291
WATER PARK, HERE WE COME.

13:52.333 --> 13:55.667
- NOT SO FAST!

13:55.709 --> 13:57.333
- OW!

13:57.375 --> 14:01.667
- ALTHOUGH THE EVIDENCE

13:57.375 --> 14:01.667
PLACES BOTH DICKY AND RICKY

14:01.709 --> 14:03.750
AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME,

14:03.792 --> 14:06.834
THERE IS NO DOUBT

14:03.792 --> 14:06.834
THE FLOATING FLAMINGO BELONGS

14:06.875 --> 14:09.125
TO DAWN!

14:09.166 --> 14:12.959
- DAWN, DAWN, DAWN!

14:13.000 --> 14:14.792
- ME?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.792
WHAT?

14:14.834 --> 14:17.625
- IF ANY OF YOU

14:14.834 --> 14:17.625
HAD BEEN PAYING ATTENTION,

14:17.667 --> 14:22.875
YOU WOULD HAVE NOTICED THIS

14:17.667 --> 14:22.875
SMALL ORANGE SMUDGE ON THE SINK.

14:22.917 --> 14:24.125
- THERE'S A FINGERPRINT IN IT.

14:24.166 --> 14:26.041
- OH, IS THERE?

14:26.083 --> 14:29.250
I WONDER WHOSE IT IS.

14:29.291 --> 14:33.333
IF I WAS A GAMBLING MAN,

14:29.291 --> 14:33.333
I'D BET IT ALL ON DAWN.

14:33.375 --> 14:34.542
- HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S MINE?

14:34.583 --> 14:39.208
THAT COULD BE

14:34.583 --> 14:39.208
ANYBODY'S FINGERPRINT.

14:39.250 --> 14:43.583
- LOOKS LIKE THE HAND YOU'RE

14:39.250 --> 14:43.583
HOLDING IS A ROYAL DIDN'T FLUSH.

14:43.625 --> 14:47.083
- SO I LEFT A FINGERPRINT

14:43.625 --> 14:47.083
IN THE BATHROOM,

14:47.125 --> 14:48.333
THAT DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING.

14:48.375 --> 14:51.500
- DICKY LEFT A HAIR,

14:48.375 --> 14:51.500
RICKY LEFT A NAME TAG,

14:55.166 --> 15:00.834
AND NICKY LEFT HIS SPECIAL SPOON

14:55.166 --> 15:00.834
IN THE TRASH.

15:00.875 --> 15:02.792
- I CAN EXPLAIN.

15:06.375 --> 15:08.375
FINE!

15:08.417 --> 15:09.709
I WAS IN THE BATHROOM

15:08.417 --> 15:09.709
LAST NIGHT,

15:09.750 --> 15:12.500
BUT SO WERE ALL OF YOU.

15:12.542 --> 15:14.166
- HE'S RIGHT.

15:14.208 --> 15:18.041
THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT PLACES US

15:14.208 --> 15:18.041
ALL AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.500
- ALL RIGHT, WHICH ONE OF YOU

15:19.542 --> 15:21.458
IS FINALLY READY

15:19.542 --> 15:21.458
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY?

15:21.500 --> 15:24.542
all: IT WASN'T ME!

15:24.583 --> 15:25.917
- REALLY KIDS?

15:25.959 --> 15:27.959
ALL MORNING, AND WE'RE BACK

15:25.959 --> 15:27.959
TO WHERE WE STARTED?

15:28.000 --> 15:29.834
THAT'S IT.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.834
IF YOU DON'T FIGURE THIS OUT

15:29.875 --> 15:31.291
IN THE NEXT 20 MINUTES,

15:29.875 --> 15:31.291
WE'RE STAYING HOME.

15:31.333 --> 15:35.125
- BUT DON'T WORRY, I WILL BE

15:31.333 --> 15:35.125
TEXTING YOU ALL PICTURES

15:35.166 --> 15:38.000
OF ME DOING A CELEBRATORY JIG

15:35.166 --> 15:38.000
AFTER I CRUSH THE WONG BOYS.

15:38.041 --> 15:41.125
- TOM, IF THEY'RE NOT GOING,

15:38.041 --> 15:41.125
WE'RE NOT GOING.

15:41.166 --> 15:43.500
- SERIOUSLY?

15:43.542 --> 15:45.166
YOU NEVER WANTED TO GO

15:43.542 --> 15:45.166
TO THE PARK.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.125
YOU NEVER WANTED ME TO WIN.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.125
YOU WERE MORE CONCERNED

15:47.166 --> 15:49.458
WITH YOUR PRECIOUS TAN

15:47.166 --> 15:49.458
THAN YOUR PRECIOUS TOM.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.166
WELL, CASPER THE SELFISH GHOST,

15:52.208 --> 15:54.000
MAYBE YOU'RE THE ONE

15:52.208 --> 15:54.000
WHO LEFT THE NUMBER TWO,

15:54.041 --> 15:57.041
JUST SO I COULDN'T BE

15:54.041 --> 15:57.041
NUMBER ONE.

15:57.083 --> 15:58.458
- ME?

15:58.500 --> 16:01.125
MAYBE YOU LEFT THE UNCLAIMED

15:58.500 --> 16:01.125
PACKAGE IN THE P.U. BOX.

16:01.166 --> 16:03.500
MAYBE YOU WANTED TO GO

16:01.166 --> 16:03.500
BY YOURSELF

16:03.542 --> 16:06.542
SO YOUR KIDS WOULDN'T DISTRACT

16:03.542 --> 16:06.542
YOU FROM YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL.

16:06.583 --> 16:08.709

16:13.125 --> 16:15.834
WE KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT SOMEONE

16:13.125 --> 16:15.834
IN THIS ROOM DID IT.

16:15.875 --> 16:19.500
- BUT WHO?

16:15.875 --> 16:19.500
WAS IT DICKY?

16:19.542 --> 16:20.542
RICKY?

DAWN?

16:22.291 --> 16:24.500
OR NICKY?

16:24.542 --> 16:26.083
OR COULD IT BE ANNE?

16:26.125 --> 16:27.417
- AREN'T YOU FORGETTING SOMEONE?

16:27.458 --> 16:28.625
- RIGHT.

16:28.667 --> 16:32.792
MAYBE IT WAS THE DOG?

16:32.834 --> 16:36.000
- OR MAYBE IT WAS TOM?

16:36.041 --> 16:38.959
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT DOES ADD DRAMA.

16:44.834 --> 16:46.083

17:29.959 --> 17:33.583
YOU CAN'T PIN THE POOP ON ME,

17:33.625 --> 17:37.542
BECAUSE IF I'D DONE IT,

THERE'D BE NO SOLID EVIDENCE.

18:23.917 --> 18:26.166
- NO, I COULDN'T HAVE.

19:41.667 --> 19:45.417
THAT ICE CREAM GLOWS NO MATTER

19:41.667 --> 19:45.417
WHAT BOWL IT'S IN.

19:45.458 --> 19:47.208
- SORRY, MOM.

19:45.458 --> 19:47.208

20:03.583 --> 20:05.500

20:10.291 --> 20:12.208
TOOK OUT

MOM'S SPRAY BRONZER,

20:12.250 --> 20:14.458

20:14.500 --> 20:17.083

20:19.041 --> 20:21.709
PLUS, IT'S MESSY,

20:19.041 --> 20:21.709
AND IT DOESN'T DRY FOR HOURS.

20:21.750 --> 20:22.792
- EXACTLY!

20:22.834 --> 20:25.792
I TESTED IT ON THE BACK

20:22.834 --> 20:25.792
OF MY LEGS,

20:25.834 --> 20:28.000
SO IF I HAD BEEN THE ONE

20:25.834 --> 20:28.000

20:28.041 --> 20:29.500
THE SEAT WOULD BE ORANGE,

20:29.542 --> 20:34.000

20:29.542 --> 20:34.000
WHO SET THE FLAMINGO FREE.

20:34.041 --> 20:40.417
- WELL, IF IT WASN'T ANY OF US,
