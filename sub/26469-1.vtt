02:04.677 --> 02:10.314
- Hey! Hey!

02:10.316 --> 02:13.283
My shoulder is fucked up,
but there was

02:13.285 --> 02:15.287

02:16.321 --> 02:18.021

Can you hold on a second?

02:23.328 --> 02:25.662
Ma'am, are you OK?

02:29.301 --> 02:30.435

02:35.240 --> 02:37.373
<i>Were you involved

02:37.375 --> 02:39.209
No, I'm a bylaw driver

02:39.211 --> 02:41.143
with Jack Rabbit Towing.

02:41.145 --> 02:42.378
Bylaw, are you
calling this in?

02:42.380 --> 02:44.380
Hi, Chaser.
I'm on with 911.

02:46.718 --> 02:49.552
No, no first on scene!

02:49.554 --> 02:51.488
Save some for the
dayshift, you greedy bitch!

02:51.490 --> 02:53.422
Try waking up earlier,
you lazy fuck!

02:53.424 --> 02:55.324
Fucking, hillbilly.

02:55.326 --> 02:56.726
<i>Emergency
services are on their way.</i>

02:56.728 --> 02:57.794
<i>Can you stay on scene</i>

02:57.796 --> 02:58.828
<i>and provide a statement?</i>

02:58.830 --> 03:00.030
Yeah, will do.

03:02.633 --> 03:03.567
Buddy!

03:14.778 --> 03:16.280
I've seen worse.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.550
Listen, they're going to get
you out.

03:21.552 --> 03:22.751
We'll get you right
side up,

03:22.753 --> 03:24.620
and I'll tow you
out of here!

03:24.622 --> 03:26.187
What happened
to the other guy?

03:26.189 --> 03:28.623
He doesn't
touch accidents.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.559
Don't worry! I got you.
You're going to be just fine.

03:31.561 --> 03:32.627
What about the cyclist?

03:32.629 --> 03:34.161
Is she OK?

03:35.231 --> 03:36.299
The cyclist?

03:39.202 --> 03:41.402
Sorry, man.
It doesn't look good.

03:41.404 --> 03:43.137
She's not moving!

03:43.139 --> 03:45.406
- I'll walk, man.
- Yeah, I know.

03:45.408 --> 03:46.709
It happens
that fast.

03:47.844 --> 03:50.378
Man, that's
the cops coming.

03:50.380 --> 03:52.314
Hey, listen man.
You seem like a good guy.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.382
If you want,
I could tell the cops

03:55.384 --> 03:58.184
that I saw
the whole fucking thing.

03:58.186 --> 04:00.790
I was here the whole time, and
that it was the cyclist's fault.

04:02.859 --> 04:04.257
Would you do that for me?

04:04.259 --> 04:05.826
Sure! I got to make sure

04:05.828 --> 04:06.861
that it's worth my while.

04:06.863 --> 04:08.395
You know what I mean?

04:08.397 --> 04:10.499
It's just
that fair is fair.

04:12.534 --> 04:13.600
How much?

04:13.602 --> 04:16.636
I'll get my machine.

04:18.273 --> 04:19.408
That's how it's done.

04:36.424 --> 04:37.489
Sir!

04:37.491 --> 04:38.326
Hey, Sir!

04:39.760 --> 04:41.860
I don't know
who's at fault here but...

04:41.862 --> 04:42.863
You didn't kill her.

04:45.433 --> 04:46.367
Oh, thank God!

04:50.404 --> 04:52.771
There is another driver here.
He's a good friend of mine.

04:52.773 --> 04:54.573
He works for
the same company I do.

04:54.575 --> 04:56.109
Jack Rabbit Towing.

04:57.445 --> 04:59.210
Use him.

04:59.212 --> 05:00.345

05:32.646 --> 05:34.244
<i>Rise and grind,

<i>You want to get paid?</i>

05:36.816 --> 05:37.915
<i>and keep
these paychecks coming in.</i>

05:37.917 --> 05:39.251
<i>Money is on the road.</i>

05:39.953 --> 05:41.585
<i>I went to the base.</i>

05:41.587 --> 05:44.657
<i>Bravo, Mike,
Echo, Charlie 781.</i>

05:45.624 --> 05:48.260
<i>On the list.
Jack Rabbit 12. Hello?</i>

05:49.261 --> 05:51.261
- <i>Go for 12.</i>

05:51.263 --> 05:53.630
<i>my plate checks, boys?
Is everyone on coffee breaks?</i>

05:53.632 --> 05:55.367
<i>It's called a
drive through, use it!</i>

05:56.435 --> 06:02.673
<i>One two base, Charlie,
Alpha, Quebec, Kilo, 359.</i>

06:02.675 --> 06:03.809
<i>On the list.</i>

06:06.444 --> 06:09.278
<i>You know, It's still
slow out there, Constance.</i>

06:09.280 --> 06:10.816
<i>Don't blame Connie
if you're without a lead.</i>

06:13.584 --> 06:15.785
<i>Good news! Jack Rabbit
four bought Mama Timmy's.</i>

06:15.787 --> 06:18.254
<i>Guess who gets the trade

06:18.256 --> 06:22.358
<i>It's business 101, people.
Is anybody near Forest Hill?</i>

06:22.360 --> 06:23.826
<i>Got a call in for a Mercedes.</i>

06:23.828 --> 06:25.897
<i>Owner locked
his keys in the car.</i>

06:44.581 --> 06:46.583
You can collect
your car around the back.

06:47.985 --> 06:50.387
Jack Rabbit Towing.
We hop, to it!

06:53.690 --> 06:54.991
12, Harbour Square.

06:56.693 --> 06:57.594
15, minutes.

06:59.329 --> 07:01.963
Who wants to take an
engine boost at 12 Harbor?

07:01.965 --> 07:03.333
I could use it, actually.

07:04.668 --> 07:05.802
Yeah, you could use it.

07:06.737 --> 07:08.870
One tow ate up
your whole morning.

07:08.872 --> 07:10.939
Well.

07:10.941 --> 07:12.372
I had to stay on scene.

07:12.374 --> 07:13.842
Cops wanted a statement.

07:13.844 --> 07:15.611
Why did you call 911
in the first place?

07:16.847 --> 07:17.948
That's what people do.

07:33.662 --> 07:34.563
Hi!

07:35.498 --> 07:36.565
Hi!

07:45.440 --> 07:50.378
Wait, wait!
Open! Open!

07:53.883 --> 07:54.816
What does it taste like?

07:56.451 --> 07:57.719
Tartar?
Not a shred of meat.

07:59.654 --> 08:01.121
How do you do that?

08:01.123 --> 08:02.722
Little bit of this,
little bit of that.

08:02.724 --> 08:04.692
I'm trying an all
veggy dinner tonight.

08:06.628 --> 08:08.127
I thought we were going
to grill something tonight.

08:08.129 --> 08:09.397
Yeah.

08:11.365 --> 08:12.066
We...

08:13.367 --> 08:14.301
Are dry.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.473
So, how did you
get all this?

08:21.408 --> 08:22.509
A foodbank.

08:47.601 --> 08:49.468
We talked about this, OK?

08:51.437 --> 08:52.505
- I know we did.
- I was...

08:53.974 --> 08:55.841
I'm serious.

08:55.843 --> 08:57.441
You can't keep
starting fights.

08:57.443 --> 08:59.643
I'm always
being a cock wipe.

08:59.645 --> 09:00.845
Do you think
I'm playing around?

09:00.847 --> 09:02.847
I'm trying!

09:02.849 --> 09:03.950
I'm trying.

09:05.852 --> 09:06.719
What happened, Zack?

09:07.820 --> 09:11.021
He wouldn't give me
a turn on his bike.

09:11.023 --> 09:12.990
He said I dress like
a welfare case.

09:12.992 --> 09:15.726
I'd give his bike bedbugs.

09:15.728 --> 09:17.897
He said "poor
people walked".

09:23.002 --> 09:24.003
Hey!

09:25.771 --> 09:26.705
I'll get you a bike.

09:28.174 --> 09:31.507
I'll get you a bike.
Your own bike for your birthday.

09:31.509 --> 09:32.912
Your very own bike.

09:35.513 --> 09:36.915
A welfare bike.

09:39.451 --> 09:40.585
What do you have in mind?

09:42.621 --> 09:43.655
Show it to me.

10:03.008 --> 10:04.142
What!

10:07.711 --> 10:09.047
That's a good looking bike.

10:10.081 --> 10:12.183
I'm going to get you
this bike for your birthday.

10:13.651 --> 10:14.585
If...

10:15.886 --> 10:17.586
You promise me

10:17.588 --> 10:20.222
you stop getting
into those fights.

10:20.224 --> 10:22.057
You need to show me that...

10:22.059 --> 10:24.028
That you're going to
be a civilized little man.

10:28.198 --> 10:30.533
- Promise?
- I promise.

10:50.119 --> 10:51.020
<i>Zack! You know that
you're named after</i>

10:52.555 --> 10:54.157
<i>your grandfather, right?</i>

10:55.525 --> 10:56.192
<i>That was my dad.</i>

10:57.527 --> 10:59.827
<i>He was just
a mechanic, but</i>

10:59.829 --> 11:01.731
<i>he was the most
civilized man in that town.</i>

11:03.299 --> 11:05.565
<i>Everybody liked Zachary.</i>

11:05.567 --> 11:06.702
<i>Do you want to know why?</i>

11:08.004 --> 11:10.670
<i>He didn't use his fists.</i>

11:10.672 --> 11:11.773
<i>He used his words.</i>

11:12.874 --> 11:15.911
<i>He said: "Never
wrestle with pigs".</i>

11:16.845 --> 11:18.678
<i>You'll
always end up dirty.</i>

11:18.680 --> 11:19.815
<i>And pigs like it.</i>

11:20.983 --> 11:22.584
<i>Why do
the pigs like it?</i>

11:23.785 --> 11:24.853
<i>I don't know, buddy.</i>

11:26.588 --> 11:27.656
<i>Pigs are pigs.</i>

11:44.905 --> 11:47.706
- Hey! Bylaw!
- Hey, Chaser!

11:47.708 --> 11:50.576
You're not
dragging your sack anymore.

11:50.578 --> 11:53.212
Did Bissey finally
buy you some new gear?

11:53.214 --> 11:55.315
No, he wouldn't open
his wallet for this thing.

11:55.317 --> 11:58.751
I had to tool new
mufflers from scraps.

11:58.753 --> 12:02.588
Built new custom cold air
intake, retimed her.

12:02.590 --> 12:05.991
Saving on fuel. And getting
like 20% extra horses.

12:05.993 --> 12:08.861
Arts and freaking craft.

12:08.863 --> 12:10.362
What's the story there?

12:10.364 --> 12:11.864
Freaking owner
want's it brought

12:11.866 --> 12:13.598
to the
dealership in Oakfield.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.101
That's 200 for the
outer city service charge.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.935
One fifty for the mileage.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.670
So I tell the moron
that I'm going to need put it

12:19.672 --> 12:21.739
on Dolly's. That's
another 150 right there.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.375
We're looking at
an almost seven bills

12:23.377 --> 12:24.976
before I
take it to Jeano's

12:24.978 --> 12:26.644
who's gonna give
kickbacks on repairs.

12:26.646 --> 12:29.180
And this is my
forth wreck Of the shift.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.915
- Dickhead!
- How about you?

12:30.917 --> 12:32.250
How much is that
little minnow get ya?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.318
About 65 bucks.

12:34.320 --> 12:38.156
It makes more if it sits in the
lock collecting impound fees.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.924
<i>At the diner,
two vehicle collision.</i>

12:39.926 --> 12:42.060
<i>We rendered a tractor trailer.</i>

12:42.062 --> 12:43.196
See what I mean?

12:44.998 --> 12:46.797
I can't keep up with
these crazy drivers

12:46.799 --> 12:50.001
- crashing into each other.
- Hi, Sitting Bull!

12:50.003 --> 12:51.668
You're hiding
behind treaty rights?

12:51.670 --> 12:54.773
Ah! Fuck!

12:55.941 --> 12:57.076
I need two trucks!

12:58.110 --> 12:59.578
Stay gold, Jack Rabbit.

13:38.950 --> 13:40.084
What did you do with
Zack?

13:41.719 --> 13:44.019
He's been
watching TV at Debbies.

13:44.021 --> 13:45.389
It's okay for
like 20 minutes.

13:47.425 --> 13:49.360
He's been talking
about that bike all day.

13:51.195 --> 13:52.662
300 dollar bike.

13:55.765 --> 13:57.266
He's not going to
grow up like those losers

13:57.268 --> 13:58.336
we knew in high school.

14:00.304 --> 14:02.137
It's worth every penny.

14:02.139 --> 14:04.038
We can't even
afford grocery's.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.074
Avery!

14:06.076 --> 14:06.810
Hey!

14:09.746 --> 14:11.146
I'll pick up
more??? on patrol.

14:11.148 --> 14:12.382
I'll work seven days a week.

14:14.384 --> 14:15.352
Whatever we need.

14:19.222 --> 14:20.824
Do you ever
think about going home?

14:22.092 --> 14:22.993
No, ma'am.

14:24.261 --> 14:25.428
No, ma'am.

14:27.197 --> 14:29.497
Because my wife

14:29.499 --> 14:33.403
is going to open the sweetest
restaurant you've ever seen.

14:35.037 --> 14:36.170
I'm going to have a garage

14:36.172 --> 14:37.938
right around the corner

14:37.940 --> 14:41.076
customizing cars
for DJ's and rappers.

14:42.278 --> 14:44.211
And every day after work

14:44.213 --> 14:45.714
I'm going to
sit at that bar

14:46.949 --> 14:49.082
and my wife is
going to yell at me

14:49.084 --> 14:52.019
for how filthy
my hands are.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.387
I'm going to
bawl my eyes out

14:53.389 --> 14:55.157
When we call
our little boy.

14:57.059 --> 14:59.961
He's off at university
studying to be a real

15:01.063 --> 15:03.330

15:03.332 --> 15:05.432
technician...

15:05.434 --> 15:08.100
engineer... I don't care.

15:08.102 --> 15:10.102
I will be so happy.

15:10.104 --> 15:11.270
<i>You're ridiculous.</i>

15:11.272 --> 15:12.939
Yes.

15:12.941 --> 15:14.375
You're lucky you're so cute.

15:20.481 --> 15:23.051
You better watch it,
your hands are fucking filthy.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.203
What the fuck?

15:44.338 --> 15:46.773
You guys are standing around
like a bunch of pylons?

15:48.508 --> 15:50.542
Sit down, you lazy cunts.

15:50.544 --> 15:52.277
None of you assholes
deserve this

15:52.279 --> 15:55.782
but we won
the police contract!

15:58.418 --> 16:00.853
The fucking police contract!

16:04.957 --> 16:06.424
Alright, settle down

16:06.426 --> 16:07.492
before you start
giving each other

16:07.494 --> 16:09.327
reach-arounds.

16:09.329 --> 16:11.396
This is one
piece of the jackpot.

16:11.398 --> 16:14.298
You got to put some
skin on the game, alright?

16:14.300 --> 16:15.866
That means

16:15.868 --> 16:17.368
no one drives
my trucks for free.

16:17.370 --> 16:18.969
From now on

16:18.971 --> 16:21.071
you lease your trucks
from Jack Rabbit.

16:21.073 --> 16:22.273
You're kidding, right?

16:22.275 --> 16:24.041
- Alright?
- I got a mortgage.

16:24.043 --> 16:25.876
Hey, rah, rah fucking la.

16:25.878 --> 16:27.378
Tomorrow afternoon I'm
going to have guys lined up

16:27.380 --> 16:28.912
all around
the fucking block.

16:28.914 --> 16:30.247
Drivers, just
like yourselves

16:30.249 --> 16:31.882
begging to give me
first and last

16:31.884 --> 16:33.550
so they too can suckle

16:33.552 --> 16:36.855
off that big fat fucking
titty of a police contract.

16:38.357 --> 16:39.956
So think on it, guys.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.358
My wife is
going to drop off

16:41.360 --> 16:42.359
the leasing arrangements,

16:42.361 --> 16:43.360
and when she does,

16:43.362 --> 16:44.361
you come and see me

16:44.363 --> 16:46.262
with money in hand.

16:46.264 --> 16:47.997
Come up with first and last.

16:47.999 --> 16:51.034
Otherwise,
get the fuck off my lot.

16:51.036 --> 16:52.270
Jesus Christ!

17:24.435 --> 17:26.335
That's shitty, man.

17:26.337 --> 17:28.339
Losing your truck
right When you hit the jackpot.

17:30.341 --> 17:32.240
For me I'd...

17:32.242 --> 17:35.310
I'd give some serious thought
of going back home.

17:35.312 --> 17:37.279
Maybe they'll let you teach

17:37.281 --> 17:38.881
auto at the old Alma Mater.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.586
All those tight high school
girls hot for the teacher?

17:44.053 --> 17:45.153
Go, Trojans, go, right?

17:45.155 --> 17:46.153
I'm not going home.

17:46.155 --> 17:48.022
I'm not going backwards.

17:48.024 --> 17:50.494
I'm not walking away from
that police contract, just...

17:53.597 --> 17:55.329
Where is Avery in all this?

17:55.331 --> 17:57.264
I thought that
she had her heart

17:57.266 --> 17:58.602
set on that
cooking school, right?

18:02.472 --> 18:03.573
Yeah, I know.

18:06.042 --> 18:07.942
My wife thinks I should
take it to the dealer.

18:07.944 --> 18:10.611
No, that's four dollars
a kilometer.

18:10.613 --> 18:13.481
But I know a body shop
that specializes in fine cars.

18:13.483 --> 18:14.384
They work fast.

18:15.318 --> 18:16.319
That's where I take my baby.

18:20.021 --> 18:20.989
OK!

18:23.258 --> 18:25.528
That's another
15 points from Kaleb.

18:27.563 --> 18:29.028
Kickbacks on repairs

18:29.030 --> 18:32.232
it's, way better than mileage.

18:32.234 --> 18:33.268
Actually I...

18:34.302 --> 18:35.971
I was thinking about that guy

18:37.639 --> 18:40.707
Ray Junior??

18:40.709 --> 18:42.675
Yeah!

18:42.677 --> 18:45.712
Yeah, No.
Ray is a good guy.

18:45.714 --> 18:47.580
Good call, totally.

18:47.582 --> 18:49.217
How fast can you
get me in touch with him?

19:02.430 --> 19:04.096
Are you Ray?

19:04.098 --> 19:04.999
Ben!

19:13.307 --> 19:14.373
I like your office.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.044
- Have a sit.
- Yes, Sir.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.148
Oh, my gosh!

19:22.183 --> 19:23.684
Five thousand, Ray's way.

19:25.018 --> 19:27.753
Ray's way means
payments due every week on time.

19:27.755 --> 19:29.557
No bitching,
no crying, no grief.

19:32.091 --> 19:33.494
Five grand principle.

19:35.395 --> 19:37.128
One grand interest.

19:37.130 --> 19:39.564
Comes back to me.

19:39.566 --> 19:41.365
750 a week for eight weeks.

19:41.367 --> 19:43.100
Starting next week.

19:43.102 --> 19:46.172
Just so you know,
I'm not going to start earning

19:47.173 --> 19:49.140
till that police contract
kicks in.

19:49.142 --> 19:51.742
My buddy in traffic services
says it's a done deal.

19:51.744 --> 19:53.311
They are just
ironing out the fine print

19:53.313 --> 19:54.581
with your boss, right?

19:57.383 --> 20:01.051
750 next week.

20:01.053 --> 20:03.754
Could make me send my wife
back to the food bank.

20:03.756 --> 20:05.991
I'm not really
making you do anything.

20:13.432 --> 20:15.131
First and last.

20:15.133 --> 20:16.268
I'm glad
you're sticking around.

20:17.302 --> 20:18.770
We are going to have
a great fucking year.

20:21.473 --> 20:22.541
Money is on the road.

20:32.618 --> 20:34.453
No, no! You don't!

20:35.721 --> 20:36.655
Ma'am!

20:38.489 --> 20:39.558
Let go!

20:40.592 --> 20:42.525
OK, ma'am. What are you...

20:42.527 --> 20:44.126
Hey, hey!

20:44.128 --> 20:45.160
No!

20:45.162 --> 20:46.328
Not a good idea!

20:46.330 --> 20:47.730
Ma'am!

20:47.732 --> 20:49.567
Excuse... Oh, God!

20:51.269 --> 20:52.270
Hey!

20:55.306 --> 20:56.574
Fuck you!

21:16.694 --> 21:20.528
Did you get
into any fights today?

21:20.530 --> 21:21.498
No!

22:21.656 --> 22:24.290
- Your late!
- Yes, it's a slow week.

22:24.292 --> 22:26.292
Waiting on that police
contract to come through.

22:26.294 --> 22:28.260
That's not my department.

22:28.262 --> 22:31.430
You guys said it's
going to be any day now.

22:31.432 --> 22:33.699
Your boss is not doing
his part to close the deal.

22:33.701 --> 22:34.834
That's between him and them,

22:34.836 --> 22:36.602
this is between you and me.

22:36.604 --> 22:38.206
I got to ding you
for a late fee.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.807
Second, there's interest
on the late fee, daily.

22:41.809 --> 22:44.275
And there is interest on
the amount that you're short.

22:44.277 --> 22:46.244
OK, alright!

22:46.246 --> 22:47.913
Next week, I promise.

22:47.915 --> 22:49.282
Promise.

22:50.852 --> 22:51.886
Drive safe, Sir.

23:04.798 --> 23:06.767
Thank you so much
for meeting me here.

23:07.834 --> 23:09.868
You've been
so helpful, I...

23:09.870 --> 23:13.440
And, have you managed to
get any kitchen experience?

23:15.274 --> 23:16.443
Nothing long term.

23:17.577 --> 23:20.277
I can't staff a decent
kitchen without any training.

23:20.279 --> 23:21.447
And I can't
get any training

23:22.683 --> 23:24.615
because I'm working
all the time.

23:24.617 --> 23:27.418
But I was thinking that
you might look into some grants?

23:27.420 --> 23:29.455
Yeah, I could put
together some options.

23:30.456 --> 23:32.291
The application
do take a while.

23:33.259 --> 23:34.692
Yeah!

23:34.694 --> 23:37.396
What about short term?

23:39.398 --> 23:42.599
Where are you at
with family support?

23:42.601 --> 23:45.469
We used up all of my husbands
inheritance just to move here.

23:45.471 --> 23:47.604
Wich was basically like

23:47.606 --> 23:49.673
just his dad's car.

23:49.675 --> 23:53.309
And my mom is pretty toxic.
We had a bad moment

23:53.311 --> 23:57.413
which is part of the
reason for why we left.

23:57.415 --> 23:59.917
Your husband
has a permanent job.

23:59.919 --> 24:03.921
What happened with
his paycheck this week?

24:03.923 --> 24:05.623
I don't even know what's...

24:08.493 --> 24:11.262
You don't know how
your husband spends his money?

24:22.040 --> 24:22.941
What are they saying?

24:24.609 --> 24:26.743
That one is police dispatch.

24:26.745 --> 24:29.946
That one is fire. And those
two there is your ambulance.

24:31.950 --> 24:33.916
Dad doesn't have scanners.

24:33.918 --> 24:35.317
That because your dads bylaw.

24:35.319 --> 24:37.419
All he does is tow parked cars.

24:37.421 --> 24:38.689
But if you're a chaser...

24:39.991 --> 24:42.424
Scanners are your best friend.
Listen real close for accidents

24:42.426 --> 24:43.658
so you can get there first

24:43.660 --> 24:44.893
and get the best tow.

24:44.895 --> 24:47.931
It's like a...
Like a race.

24:49.500 --> 24:50.667
Chasers are pigs.

24:57.708 --> 25:00.474
I know your dad doesn't
like playing dirty.

25:00.476 --> 25:02.443
And that worked great
for him when he was a captain

25:02.445 --> 25:04.378
on the high school hockey team.

25:04.380 --> 25:05.983
He scored a lot of goals,
he scored your mom.

25:07.017 --> 25:07.985
Now...

25:09.485 --> 25:11.654
Now, he's got no wing-man.

25:12.822 --> 25:14.355
He's got no horces
to back him up.

25:14.357 --> 25:15.456
That's why
his stuck out there

25:15.458 --> 25:16.926
looking for tows so late.

25:19.862 --> 25:21.831
And you are stuck here
when your mom's at work.

25:31.841 --> 25:33.373
Here!

25:33.375 --> 25:34.342
It's on me.

25:35.111 --> 25:36.709
Jesus!

25:36.711 --> 25:38.378
What are you packing here?

25:38.380 --> 25:41.514
About 20 pounds
of rice and lentils.

25:41.516 --> 25:42.919
Charity again.

25:44.786 --> 25:45.854
They're a life saver.

25:48.690 --> 25:50.425
If you ever need
a little extra...

25:51.459 --> 25:53.695
Even if it's just to keep Zack
in after school care.

25:56.565 --> 25:58.431
Thank you.

25:58.433 --> 25:59.434
I'll think about it.

26:00.434 --> 26:01.636
Hey! Get in the back!

26:25.426 --> 26:26.491
Long shift?

26:26.493 --> 26:27.461
Mhm.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.931
I had to close again alone.

26:43.743 --> 26:45.543
Don't you have to
get up in a few hours?

26:45.545 --> 26:47.145
I'm studying the routes.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.716
You know.
Every second counts.

26:52.886 --> 26:54.721
Where is that
police contract at?

26:56.756 --> 26:57.857
He's just closing it.

27:20.013 --> 27:23.815
<i>I've being
charged without being told!</i>

27:24.816 --> 27:29.586
<i>Half the time I'm sipping
coffee with...</i>

27:29.588 --> 27:35.759
<i>How many times
do I have to supply accountants?</i>

27:35.761 --> 27:38.194
- What is this?
- When your behind on your truck

27:38.196 --> 27:39.564
it comes
straight off your pay.

27:40.565 --> 27:42.533
And you're
still short a 150.

28:00.518 --> 28:03.619
- <i>Dad!</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

28:03.621 --> 28:05.154
<i>Are you working so much</i>

28:05.156 --> 28:06.857
<i>because we are
broke ass white trash?</i>

28:10.695 --> 28:11.862
<i>Who said that?</i>

28:13.798 --> 28:15.563
<i>Kamal.</i>

28:15.565 --> 28:17.600
<i>He tried to
start another fight.</i>

28:18.936 --> 28:20.668
And...

28:20.670 --> 28:22.605
Another week without a fight.

28:55.838 --> 28:58.039
The bathroom in the men's
is all clogged up.

28:58.041 --> 29:01.242
Oh, OK. can I
get you some coffee?

29:01.244 --> 29:03.643
No, I'm...

29:03.645 --> 29:05.346
I'm looking for your husband.

29:05.348 --> 29:06.713
Why? What happened?

29:06.715 --> 29:08.215
Nothing yet!

29:08.217 --> 29:09.816
We were supposed to
meet up this morning.

29:09.818 --> 29:11.153
Now his not
answering his phone.

29:12.654 --> 29:13.655
Well...

29:14.590 --> 29:16.289
If his busy with calls,
it could take him

29:16.291 --> 29:17.693
a few hours
before he picks up.

29:19.962 --> 29:21.762
You should try him.

29:21.764 --> 29:22.829
Tell him it's Ray.
Tell him Ray

29:22.831 --> 29:23.766
really wants his money.

29:27.702 --> 29:29.102
Soon as I have a minute.

29:29.104 --> 29:30.772
I would appreciate that.
Thank you.

29:32.141 --> 29:33.108
Avery.

30:25.859 --> 30:28.093
Yeah, yeah, call the next driver
on the list.

30:28.095 --> 30:29.894
I've got
another truck freed up.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.863
Keep in touch, Al!

30:31.865 --> 30:33.730
Pathetic stories.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.866
What about you? We going
to get your next monthly?

30:35.868 --> 30:37.368
Or is your truck
freed up too?

30:37.370 --> 30:39.069
When is that
police contract kicking in?

30:39.071 --> 30:41.339
Yeah, Bissey.
When is it kicking in?

30:41.341 --> 30:43.874
Katy, would you mind
coming in the office?

30:43.876 --> 30:45.242
I don't want to
keep you waiting.

30:45.244 --> 30:46.710
It's been
one of these days

30:46.712 --> 30:48.080
when we're quite busy.

30:49.849 --> 30:52.683
When, when? You sound like
my fucking wife.

30:52.685 --> 30:54.284
Yeah, when?

30:54.286 --> 30:57.121
I'm in the middle of
a very delicate negotiation.

30:57.123 --> 30:59.990
We will be signing
either way, next week, OK?

30:59.992 --> 31:02.092
- Christ!
- Next week, next week.

31:02.094 --> 31:03.994
Next week is great,
that sounds fantastic.

31:03.996 --> 31:07.131
We have been waiting a lot
longer than we thought.

31:07.133 --> 31:09.765
If I'm going to last
another week

31:09.767 --> 31:11.403
you've got to
give me an advance!

31:14.739 --> 31:16.873
Ray needs a grand today.

31:16.875 --> 31:20.009
- Huh!
- And 300 next week.

31:20.011 --> 31:22.745
It's for a bike for my son.
It's his birthday.

31:22.747 --> 31:24.480
Bissey, come on!
This is not a lot to you.

31:24.482 --> 31:26.949
I know it's not!
This is not a hand out either.

31:26.951 --> 31:29.852
I'm working hard. I'm out
there 12 hours a day for you.

31:29.854 --> 31:32.021
12 hours a day!

31:32.023 --> 31:34.390
I've been busting my ass
for the last 30 years!

31:34.392 --> 31:36.125
Building this business up
from nothing!

31:36.127 --> 31:38.461
For money I saved driving
a truck 24 fucking 7!

31:38.463 --> 31:40.163
Eight days a fucking week!

31:40.165 --> 31:41.930
Eating so many fucking
baloney sandwiches,

31:41.932 --> 31:44.367
I was shitting
hotdogs out of my ass!

31:44.369 --> 31:46.502
So get in
your fucking truck

31:46.504 --> 31:48.103
and earn your goddam keep!

31:48.105 --> 31:49.773
Money is on
the fucking road!

32:14.164 --> 32:15.199
Hey!

32:16.766 --> 32:19.033
How is she running there, 22?

32:19.035 --> 32:21.536
Hey, look. It's not
that I don't want to pay you

32:21.538 --> 32:23.538
It's just that...

32:23.540 --> 32:24.740
I can't.

32:26.510 --> 32:28.375
It's cool, though.
Bissey just said

32:28.377 --> 32:30.411
he's closing the contract
next week.

32:30.413 --> 32:32.546
So, hit me up
with those late fees.

32:32.548 --> 32:34.915
I get the interest rates...

32:38.354 --> 32:40.154
It's Ray's way!

32:40.156 --> 32:41.388
First time
you come up short

32:41.390 --> 32:43.123
you got a late fee.

32:43.125 --> 32:44.491
Second time
you come up short

32:44.493 --> 32:47.026
you get a choice

32:47.028 --> 32:48.095
ankle or wrist.

32:48.097 --> 32:49.365
OK, I get it.

32:52.235 --> 32:54.435
No bitching! No crying!

32:54.437 --> 32:56.537
- Ouch!
- Ankle or wrist?

32:56.539 --> 32:58.505
- A choice.
- Hey please can you...

32:58.507 --> 32:59.573
OK, I'll decide.

32:59.575 --> 33:02.911
No! No! Please!

33:12.420 --> 33:13.787
Oh, my God!

33:16.124 --> 33:17.523
Not a few days.

33:17.525 --> 33:18.493
Tomorrow!

33:22.564 --> 33:25.300
Wow! There is no way
this is just potato.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.600
This is amazing.

33:27.602 --> 33:30.002
Seriously, Avery

33:30.004 --> 33:31.506
you got to get on to
that cooking school shit.

33:33.007 --> 33:33.941
I mean, You're...

33:35.209 --> 33:38.176
You're real chef material. You
can start your own restaurant.

33:38.178 --> 33:39.280
Sean!

33:41.515 --> 33:43.150
Who the fuck is this Ray guy?

33:44.318 --> 33:48.020
How does Ben even know
somebody like this?

33:48.022 --> 33:49.456
Look, yeah Ray...

33:51.924 --> 33:52.959
That's some serious shit.

33:53.926 --> 33:55.394
Personally I'd never
go to a guy like that.

33:55.396 --> 33:56.497
But I'm not in Ben's shoes.

33:57.897 --> 33:59.531
Yeah, no shit.

33:59.533 --> 34:01.402
You look like you've
done pretty good for yourself.

34:02.436 --> 34:03.468
Of course I am.

34:03.470 --> 34:04.404
I'm a chaser.

34:05.972 --> 34:07.572
What am I supposed to do?

34:07.574 --> 34:09.106
Is this fucking guy
going to

34:09.108 --> 34:11.175
show up on my doorstep or
something?

34:11.177 --> 34:12.210
You've got to pay him.

34:15.481 --> 34:16.882
Would you be able to...

34:18.117 --> 34:20.184
Not if it's a hardship
or anything, but...

34:20.186 --> 34:23.020
Do you think you could help
us out, just for a little while?

34:23.022 --> 34:24.856
Yeah, totally.

34:26.626 --> 34:27.558
How much do you need?

34:27.560 --> 34:28.525
I don't know.

34:28.527 --> 34:31.262
I need five grand.

34:31.264 --> 34:33.031
To stay ahead of cash flow.

34:34.032 --> 34:35.899
Of course, yeah.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.199
Thank you!

34:37.202 --> 34:38.170
You know what?

34:39.438 --> 34:40.572
Don't even sweat it.

34:42.107 --> 34:43.540
It's OK.

34:43.542 --> 34:45.476
- You're going to make it.
- Yeah.

34:53.351 --> 34:56.621
Ben!
What the hell happened?

35:00.091 --> 35:02.359
Did this Ray
do this to you?

35:02.361 --> 35:03.194
Ben!

35:24.315 --> 35:26.550
So, Sean is
going to help us out.

35:28.052 --> 35:29.053
No!

35:31.389 --> 35:32.954
Are you fucking nuts?

35:32.956 --> 35:36.592
OK, you guys
have some stuff to...

35:36.594 --> 35:40.027
I'll swing by
Zack's party tomorrow.

35:40.029 --> 35:41.231
Go, Trojan's, go!

35:45.034 --> 35:46.936
Tell me you don't see
what he's doing?

35:49.005 --> 35:50.173
He's helping us out.

35:52.175 --> 35:53.510
Don't need his kind of help.

35:55.078 --> 35:57.011
So, you won't take money
from your best friend

35:57.013 --> 35:58.515
but you take money
from a loan shark

35:59.516 --> 36:01.184
with a fucking badge?

36:04.154 --> 36:05.120
Yeah.

36:07.323 --> 36:09.724
Did he break your brain too?

36:09.726 --> 36:12.395
Police contract
starts next week.

36:13.763 --> 36:15.563
I just have to
hold on to next week.

36:15.565 --> 36:17.232
It's Zack's
birthday tomorrow.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.767
Are you even going to be there?

36:19.769 --> 36:21.001
What am I
supposed to tell Zack

36:21.003 --> 36:22.469
if you're in the ICU?

36:22.471 --> 36:23.670
That you're too proud

36:23.672 --> 36:25.205
to admit
that you fucked up.

36:25.207 --> 36:26.773
And you needed a way out.

36:28.310 --> 36:29.645
If you take a dime from him...

36:31.413 --> 36:32.581
Then we are done.

37:54.628 --> 37:57.795
Sean's scanners. Really!

37:57.797 --> 37:59.532
I'm going to give you
a run for your money.

38:00.733 --> 38:01.700
Not, even.

38:02.969 --> 38:06.136
Just your crumbs then. I need
to make some quick cash, man.

38:06.138 --> 38:07.437
So, here comes the chase

38:07.439 --> 38:09.773
on the best perch
on the Westside?

38:09.775 --> 38:11.508
Some balls!

38:20.819 --> 38:22.421
Trouble on the home front?

38:23.656 --> 38:26.690
I just have to push
through this rough patch.

38:26.692 --> 38:28.591
Push through to what?

38:28.593 --> 38:29.494
Police contract...

38:30.461 --> 38:32.295
And everything falls
into place after that.

38:32.297 --> 38:35.832
I bet! Family gets a new
swimming pool in the back yard.

38:35.834 --> 38:39.203
No, everything I make,
goes to the ten year plan.

38:40.805 --> 38:42.772
Get my own shop going.

38:42.774 --> 38:45.308
Set my wife up
with her own restaurant.

38:45.310 --> 38:47.677
And send my kid
to university.

38:47.679 --> 38:48.811
Anything he wants to study

38:48.813 --> 38:50.546
anywhere he wants to go.

38:50.548 --> 38:51.649
That's adorable.

38:52.650 --> 38:53.816
What about you?

38:53.818 --> 38:56.151
All this cash you pull in.

38:56.153 --> 38:57.321
Are you doing this for anybody?

38:59.624 --> 39:00.823
Sure!

39:00.825 --> 39:03.560
My family back on Shoal Lake 40.

39:04.896 --> 39:06.494
They are stuck on an island

39:06.496 --> 39:09.164
under a 20 year
boil water advisory

39:09.166 --> 39:11.733
while their clean water
gets pumped away to Winnipeg.

39:11.735 --> 39:15.303
And the government still doesn't
build them an access road.

39:15.305 --> 39:17.539
So, all the bucks I send home

39:17.541 --> 39:18.773
just so they can bring in

39:18.775 --> 39:20.510
bottled water on the ferry.

39:25.281 --> 39:27.515
Nah! I just like getting paid

39:27.517 --> 39:28.885
to drive like an asshole.

39:31.420 --> 39:33.487
Money is on the road.

39:33.489 --> 39:35.623
Money is on the road.

39:35.625 --> 39:37.191
But so are the other chasers.

40:02.317 --> 40:03.483
Hi, Wayne!

40:03.485 --> 40:04.519
Elvis.

40:07.389 --> 40:09.190
Are you running
a special needs day care?

40:10.291 --> 40:13.561
Jack Rabbit 22
wants to chase tonight.

40:14.496 --> 40:17.830
Are you shitting me?
On our fucking turf?

40:17.832 --> 40:18.865
Hey, I'm back to bylaw

40:18.867 --> 40:20.299
first thing tomorrow, OK.

40:20.301 --> 40:21.234
Why don't you take that

40:21.236 --> 40:22.735
perfumed vagina

40:22.737 --> 40:23.770
back to the knitting club,

40:23.772 --> 40:25.605
and stay off my road!

40:25.607 --> 40:28.641
<i>A four doors not drivable.</i>

40:28.643 --> 40:30.445
<i>Driver and
caller are on the scene.</i>

40:32.714 --> 40:34.514
<i>54 on route.</i>

40:34.516 --> 40:36.582
Well, there it is.

40:36.584 --> 40:39.219
Last one there,
gets to crank my fucking shaft.

40:40.421 --> 40:43.755
Do the math's. One wreck
and three of us chasers.

40:43.757 --> 40:44.991
This is it, little rabbit.

40:44.993 --> 40:45.992
Get hopping.

41:26.365 --> 41:28.301
You're really giving it
a lot of sauce, Elvis.

41:29.769 --> 41:32.036
Oh, yes I'm fucking
giving them the sauce.

41:32.038 --> 41:35.639
These new bitches
2 K each tire and wheel.

41:35.641 --> 41:37.041
Running around on these
is like

41:37.043 --> 41:38.642
floating on big ass
silicone titties.

41:38.644 --> 41:40.611
Oh, yeah!
You better believe

41:40.613 --> 41:41.581
I'm giving them a massage.

41:43.615 --> 41:46.449
Oh, shit! Jack Rabbit!

41:46.451 --> 41:49.719
Did you stop for a
fucking latte on the way, son?

41:49.721 --> 41:51.588
Hey, I think
it might be a little

41:51.590 --> 41:54.392
hubcap rolling around
if you want to tow something.

41:58.897 --> 42:00.797
<i>We
got a fire rescue 224.</i>

42:39.904 --> 42:41.537
You got trouble?

42:41.539 --> 42:44.773
Hey, sailor!
How much would you charge

42:44.775 --> 42:46.376
for doing something
you shouldn't be doing?

42:47.845 --> 42:49.410
He has a kink.

42:49.412 --> 42:51.712
He'll go as high
as 200 to satisfy it.

42:51.714 --> 42:53.550
It's a 100 for
me and a 100 for you.

43:15.939 --> 43:17.638
Hey!

43:17.640 --> 43:18.773
<i>It's
almost eight o'clock.</i>

43:18.775 --> 43:19.742
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

43:21.077 --> 43:21.978
I'm...

43:22.879 --> 43:24.178
I'm pulling a double.

43:24.180 --> 43:25.347
<i>Chasing.</i>

43:26.983 --> 43:27.917
Eat!

43:36.692 --> 43:38.959
So...

43:38.961 --> 43:40.527
Do you think
that we can at least

43:40.529 --> 43:42.664
talk about
taking money from Sean?

44:06.454 --> 44:08.389
I don't know,
I think I might be in love.

44:10.825 --> 44:11.759
Oh, yeah?

44:14.629 --> 44:15.930
Riding around on this tires.

44:17.632 --> 44:19.066
It is a sexual experience.

44:20.902 --> 44:21.802
I mean...

44:22.870 --> 44:28.073
In my mind I picture
these two fat, black bitches

44:28.075 --> 44:32.912
and I got them all sauced up
and they're on the rig.

44:32.914 --> 44:35.214
And under the rig I got
a gas pedal attached.

44:35.216 --> 44:38.919
And I hit the gas pedal and they
just start fucking spinning.

44:42.122 --> 44:44.956
And then the rig brings
them closer together, right?

44:44.958 --> 44:46.958
But like just close enough

44:46.960 --> 44:49.827
that I can get my fucking dick
in there.

44:49.829 --> 44:53.166
And I mean...
I just want to go at it.

44:54.968 --> 44:59.904
I really just
want to go at it.

44:59.906 --> 45:02.572
Fuck, I think I can properly
build something like that.

45:02.574 --> 45:05.444
I got the spot for it
all picked out in my basement.

45:07.513 --> 45:09.949
I'm talking fucking nice,
right? Like...

45:11.617 --> 45:12.518
I don't know.
Let's make it...

45:14.820 --> 45:16.155
Actually romantic.

45:23.662 --> 45:25.097
Thank you, so much.

45:59.230 --> 46:01.197
I didn't brush my teeth.

46:01.199 --> 46:03.933
It's OK, buddy.

46:03.935 --> 46:05.003
Listen.

46:06.004 --> 46:07.171
I'm just talking to you.

46:08.206 --> 46:10.074
You're tired.
I got to go back to work.

46:11.109 --> 46:12.640
Mom is going to be home soon.

46:12.642 --> 46:13.677
Are you going to be OK?

46:15.313 --> 46:18.282
I invited Kamal to my
birthday party tomorrow.

46:19.583 --> 46:20.817
I think we can be friends.

46:22.219 --> 46:24.121
I'm going to let him
have a ride on my new bike.

46:25.789 --> 46:27.090
Like a peace offering.

46:32.863 --> 46:33.930
Look at you.

46:35.631 --> 46:36.967
Turning into a real man.

46:39.169 --> 46:40.203
I'm so proud of you.

46:43.040 --> 46:44.207
Go back to sleep.

46:47.009 --> 46:48.609
I love you, buddy.

46:48.611 --> 46:49.612
I love you, dad.

47:29.851 --> 47:34.155
I'm sorry.
Will you call me?

47:35.323 --> 47:37.992
When you're
finishing up here?

47:38.927 --> 47:42.962
Call me. I'll pick you up.
We'll talk about this.

47:42.964 --> 47:45.764
You mean if you're not
too busy chasing body bags?

47:45.766 --> 47:47.400
You jump in here,

47:47.402 --> 47:50.735
and then race around
like some raged out shithead?

47:50.737 --> 47:52.338
Are you actually
trying to kill yourself?

47:52.340 --> 47:54.773
- What do you want from me?
- I'm scared. Look at you!

47:54.775 --> 47:58.210
You're all fucking
smashed up. And jacked up!

47:58.212 --> 48:02.080
Avery, I made
that kid a promise.

48:02.082 --> 48:04.082
All we do is make promises.

48:04.084 --> 48:06.685
We can't live off
fucking promises any more.

48:06.687 --> 48:08.186
This is our actual life.

48:08.188 --> 48:09.354
Why don't you go home.

48:09.356 --> 48:11.857
Go home and be with your son!

48:11.859 --> 48:13.125
And tomorrow we
are going to throw him

48:13.127 --> 48:15.127
a fucking
amazing birthday party

48:15.129 --> 48:17.697
like a normal family. And then
we will figure this shit out.

48:18.398 --> 48:19.730
You are not going
to make what we need

48:19.732 --> 48:22.067
in one fucking night, Ben.

48:22.069 --> 48:22.969
Watch me!

48:50.196 --> 48:53.332
<i>...we have
a collision...</i>

48:54.866 --> 48:56.035
<i>...two cars
and a motor cycle...</i>

48:57.503 --> 49:01.905
<i>We're heading up there.</i>

49:01.907 --> 49:02.807
Yes!

49:34.772 --> 49:35.804
Are you OK?

49:35.806 --> 49:36.539
This is my vehicle.

49:36.541 --> 49:37.442
I'll take you.

49:41.245 --> 49:42.878
<i>Can you tell
me what happened tonight?</i>

49:42.880 --> 49:44.980
What happened
is that that idiot

49:44.982 --> 49:45.983
came out of nowhere.

49:47.084 --> 49:47.885
<i>Have
you been drinking tonight?</i>

49:49.253 --> 49:51.053
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

49:51.055 --> 49:52.323
<i>I know who you are, counsellor.</i>

49:56.994 --> 49:59.363
<i>Is there anybody in there?</i>

50:01.798 --> 50:02.964
<i>Hi, Sir!</i>

50:02.966 --> 50:04.533
Hi, I'm here!
Hold on.

50:04.535 --> 50:06.237
I was just waiting for
the bus.

50:07.937 --> 50:09.438
I can't see at all.

50:09.440 --> 50:11.939
Hey, Jack Rabbit!
What the hell are you doing?

50:11.941 --> 50:13.808
Driving an ambulance
or a tow truck?

50:13.810 --> 50:14.875
He's hurt!

50:14.877 --> 50:16.379
Does he have a vehicle?

50:18.948 --> 50:21.215
Alright, let's go
to the ambulance, OK?

50:21.217 --> 50:22.118
It's right over here.

50:30.460 --> 50:33.527
I hate... Just keep going,
just walk that way, OK?

50:33.529 --> 50:35.463
- Just keep going.
- Which way?

50:35.465 --> 50:38.100
- Sir, I'm giving him to you.
- Hello? Which way?

50:39.335 --> 50:42.004
- First on scene here!
- First on scene. Good for you.

50:43.138 --> 50:46.106
Excuse me, ma'am! Are you in
need of assistance this evening?

50:46.108 --> 50:50.543
Hey! No soliciting on
my scene. Step back!

50:50.545 --> 50:52.846
Not a problem, officer.
First truck, right there.

50:52.848 --> 50:54.948
- I was first on scene.
- First truck, right there.

50:54.950 --> 50:57.083
First truck, step back!

50:57.085 --> 50:58.253
Step back!

51:02.057 --> 51:03.956
Just so you know

51:03.958 --> 51:06.959
It's a 100 % up to you.
You do not have to feel guilty

51:06.961 --> 51:09.094
about saying no to a
driver that you know...

51:09.096 --> 51:11.063
Hey, makes you feel unsafe.

51:11.065 --> 51:12.432
What are you doing here?

51:12.434 --> 51:14.534
Are you trying
to poach my tow?

51:14.536 --> 51:16.168
Do you think I'm
letting a fucking tow

51:16.170 --> 51:17.570
be poached by
a bylaw fucking driver?

51:17.572 --> 51:19.905
Ma'am, talk about unsafe?
Look at this.

51:19.907 --> 51:21.974
He did that all doing a tow.
He dropped a car on it.

51:21.976 --> 51:23.208
He might do that to yours.
You're not insured for that.

51:23.210 --> 51:24.943
Hey! What did I say!

51:24.945 --> 51:27.279
Yes, absolutely, officer.
First truck.

51:27.281 --> 51:28.249
First truck.

51:35.389 --> 51:38.390
Hi, ma'am.

51:38.392 --> 51:40.058
Gosh!

51:40.060 --> 51:42.095
I know this is a terrible

51:43.297 --> 51:46.565
shocking thing.

51:46.567 --> 51:48.634
The general public
has the perception that

51:48.636 --> 51:52.370
tow truck
operators are violent

51:52.372 --> 51:54.038
dishonest
ambulance chasers

51:54.040 --> 51:56.507
that they're animals, really.

51:56.509 --> 52:00.445
But you can be
assured that I am trained.

52:00.447 --> 52:02.013
I'm going to
be there for you

52:02.015 --> 52:05.149
With
professionalism and compassion

52:05.151 --> 52:08.386
- to look after you in this...
- ma'am.

52:08.388 --> 52:10.054
I got your fucking tow.

52:10.056 --> 52:11.222
Get on!

52:11.224 --> 52:13.458
I will impound your ride.

52:13.460 --> 52:15.460
Is it true
that I have a choice?

52:15.462 --> 52:16.429
Yes!

52:17.530 --> 52:19.129
Then I chose him.

52:19.131 --> 52:20.498
It's entirely up to you.

52:20.500 --> 52:22.132
You, hook it up!

52:22.134 --> 52:23.433
Yes, sir.

52:23.435 --> 52:25.037
Do you want to follow me?

52:26.038 --> 52:27.574
Excuse us.

52:30.476 --> 52:33.210
Fucking bylaw driver.

52:33.212 --> 52:35.612
I am familiar with the
various garages in the city.

52:35.614 --> 52:37.414
Where they're
located, prices...

52:37.416 --> 52:38.715
Who's honest, who's not.

52:38.717 --> 52:40.619
I can't recommend
a garage for you.

52:41.653 --> 52:43.553
I can certainly tell you
where I would take my vehicle

52:43.555 --> 52:44.421
if I was in your
situation.

53:17.655 --> 53:20.222
Come on, Kaleb.
I can count.

53:20.224 --> 53:21.724
It's ten points.

53:21.726 --> 53:23.325
I see two grands of work.

53:23.327 --> 53:25.326
That's ten points
on two grand.

53:25.328 --> 53:28.062
I want the 15 points
that everybody else gets.

53:28.064 --> 53:29.166
Who told you 15?

53:32.235 --> 53:33.170
Sean.

53:35.472 --> 53:37.105
Ben.

53:37.107 --> 53:38.573
You're lucky to
get anything tonight.

53:38.575 --> 53:40.708
Usually I
don't give advances.

53:40.710 --> 53:42.710
I appreciate that, Kaleb.
I really do, but...

53:42.712 --> 53:44.712
See this.

53:44.714 --> 53:46.481
No Mather how I scrub

53:46.483 --> 53:48.483
the grease
doesn't come off.

53:48.485 --> 53:50.652
My wife is
embarrassed for me.

53:50.654 --> 53:52.353
But...

53:52.355 --> 53:54.391
This is the business
God has blessed me with.

53:55.425 --> 53:56.726
I'm grateful for
everything I have,

53:57.727 --> 53:59.427
All of us are
supposed to be grateful.

53:59.429 --> 54:01.130
Even for the grease.

54:04.200 --> 54:07.100
Look, this
is Physio Clinic.

54:07.102 --> 54:08.569
Tell the driver
to go and heal.

54:08.571 --> 54:10.537
And they will
kickback ten points.

54:10.539 --> 54:12.239
She doesn't need Physio...

54:12.241 --> 54:15.042
It feels
fine tonight, sure.

54:15.044 --> 54:16.612
But unless she
gets treatment...

54:18.214 --> 54:21.383
Maybe two days from now she's
not able to get out of bed.

54:23.419 --> 54:24.785
Tell her that.

54:24.787 --> 54:26.120
Dude, you're killing me.

54:27.088 --> 54:28.324
Ben.

54:29.391 --> 54:32.693
Bring to me a Porsche,
a Beemer.

54:32.695 --> 54:34.495
A Mercedes.

54:34.497 --> 54:36.329
I will shower
your loins with gold.

54:43.171 --> 54:44.370
Jack Rabbit!

54:53.181 --> 54:54.682
You got a sec to chat?

54:55.817 --> 54:57.182
I guess.

54:57.184 --> 54:58.651
Good!

54:58.653 --> 55:01.320
We can't go on all night
fighting over turf.

55:01.322 --> 55:02.557
Well, OK. Let's...

55:03.791 --> 55:05.625
Be civilized about this.

55:05.627 --> 55:06.561
First off...

55:08.462 --> 55:10.128
- How much...
- I forbid you fighting

55:10.130 --> 55:11.129
- on my watch.
- How much?

55:11.131 --> 55:12.165
200 dollars.

55:17.104 --> 55:18.238
200?

55:19.540 --> 55:20.674
Fuck me!

55:22.709 --> 55:24.077
Let's take a look here.

55:25.312 --> 55:27.846
Oh! Here is 20!

55:27.848 --> 55:29.113
This is for my gas

55:29.115 --> 55:30.114
and my time chasing you,

55:30.116 --> 55:31.217
you fuck stick.

55:33.252 --> 55:35.219
Here is my 200.

55:35.221 --> 55:36.289
You got 20 left.

55:37.491 --> 55:39.223
I'm going to
leave that with you.

55:39.225 --> 55:40.357
I'm only going to take
what's rightfully

55:40.359 --> 55:41.660
fucking owed me!

55:41.662 --> 55:43.229
How is that for civilized?

55:44.430 --> 55:45.797
What?

55:45.799 --> 55:47.500
I can't fucking hear you!

55:52.538 --> 55:53.472
Hey!

55:55.441 --> 55:56.609
He gets it!

56:14.225 --> 56:16.328
I think it's time
you go home, son.

56:17.596 --> 56:20.800
And take a
nice long douche.

56:36.648 --> 56:39.181
Frankly B.

56:39.183 --> 56:42.386
I'd rather you be here
than that fucking psycho.

56:44.956 --> 56:48.758
Savage fucking pigs!

56:48.760 --> 56:51.362
No, no. Leave the
poor pigs out of this.

56:52.831 --> 56:54.465
Do you know
what's civilized?

56:55.699 --> 56:57.666
Men?

56:57.668 --> 56:58.934
Cheating,

56:58.936 --> 57:00.369
raping

57:00.371 --> 57:01.338
and killing

57:02.339 --> 57:04.208
everything in their way.

57:06.243 --> 57:10.279
Civilization is a
freaking highway of bones.

57:11.749 --> 57:13.617
You want a place on that road?

57:15.853 --> 57:18.656
Pay the goddamn toll.

57:21.992 --> 57:23.726
Good luck, Bylaw.

57:53.890 --> 57:55.555
Who beat me to it?

57:55.557 --> 57:56.991
I'm going to be
up front with you.

57:56.993 --> 57:59.325
I hurt my leg really bad.

57:59.327 --> 58:00.328
I can barely drive.

58:01.496 --> 58:02.629
I need more time.

58:02.631 --> 58:03.897
Come here!

58:03.899 --> 58:05.200
Have a bratwurst.

58:06.468 --> 58:09.369
A police contract
starts next week.

58:09.371 --> 58:10.804
Next week.

58:10.806 --> 58:12.639
Show me one ounce of mercy.

58:12.641 --> 58:13.973
I will make next week

58:13.975 --> 58:15.842
and every week after that.

58:15.844 --> 58:20.680
Raise way for life.

58:20.682 --> 58:22.450
You are not
getting the police contract.

58:24.418 --> 58:26.285
Bisseysaid we're getting
the contract.

58:26.287 --> 58:27.455
His full off shit.

58:28.355 --> 58:30.056
Yeah, he won the
police contract.

58:30.058 --> 58:31.891
Then lawyers
went through the thing

58:31.893 --> 58:33.826
and found out
that Bissey's wife

58:33.828 --> 58:35.394
was a co-owner
of a chop shop

58:35.396 --> 58:36.996
that got busted
a few years back.

58:36.998 --> 58:38.564
And that's not a big deal.

58:38.566 --> 58:40.432
Except that all
of Bissey's trucks

58:40.434 --> 58:41.368
are in her name.

58:42.369 --> 58:43.836
So, yeah you're
getting the police contract.

58:43.838 --> 58:45.306
You know when?
Fucking never.

58:47.508 --> 58:48.574
Look!

58:48.576 --> 58:49.710
Take the bratwurst.

58:51.311 --> 58:52.012
Go ahead, take it!

58:54.915 --> 58:56.749
I've got something
to show you. Come here.

58:56.751 --> 58:57.651
Come on!

59:11.931 --> 59:14.031
It's not up to me, but...

59:14.033 --> 59:15.435
I answer to the guys

59:16.402 --> 59:17.437
who control the money.

59:18.738 --> 59:20.738
They only care
about one thing.

59:20.740 --> 59:24.374
Turns out that
this piece of shit here,

59:24.376 --> 59:25.545
he ain't good for it.

59:27.013 --> 59:30.049
No, No! Don't!

59:59.111 --> 01:00:00.612
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:00:01.647 --> 01:00:02.681
Alright, so...

01:00:03.816 --> 01:00:06.018
Party decorations,
cake ingredients.

01:00:07.518 --> 01:00:09.451
I also got him
a little something.

01:00:09.453 --> 01:00:10.519
Not much.

01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:11.887
A bit of wrapping so...

01:00:11.889 --> 01:00:13.491
I'll take care of that.

01:00:16.561 --> 01:00:17.728
Well.

01:00:23.434 --> 01:00:24.902
This is to get Ray
off your back.

01:00:28.706 --> 01:00:29.841
It's five grand.

01:00:31.742 --> 01:00:35.512
Thank you so much for this.

01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:40.952
You have no idea
how much it means.

01:00:44.588 --> 01:00:46.188
Sure I do.

01:00:48.792 --> 01:00:51.426
That's you. You're next.

01:00:51.428 --> 01:00:54.598
Don't point at me with
that fucking stick! Fuck!

01:00:55.599 --> 01:00:58.700
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:00:58.702 --> 01:01:00.435
What do you want?
What can I do?

01:01:00.437 --> 01:01:02.904
I can't work if I'm hurt!

01:01:02.906 --> 01:01:04.739
I'm no good like that!

01:01:04.741 --> 01:01:05.775
Fair point.

01:01:08.144 --> 01:01:09.411
Beautiful family.

01:01:10.646 --> 01:01:11.882
Avery's a peach.

01:01:14.918 --> 01:01:16.585
Zack, uh!

01:01:17.653 --> 01:01:18.654
Beautiful.

01:01:22.625 --> 01:01:25.592
So, I'll just drop
by your house tomorrow

01:01:25.594 --> 01:01:27.596
at the party you're having
in the afternoon for him.

01:01:29.732 --> 01:01:31.133
How did you
know about that?

01:01:32.635 --> 01:01:34.103
It's called Trojans Call.

01:01:46.148 --> 01:01:47.415
Look!

01:01:49.118 --> 01:01:50.551
About Ben...

01:01:53.755 --> 01:01:54.989
He's a fucking loser.

01:01:56.758 --> 01:01:57.926
You know that now, right?

01:02:01.629 --> 01:02:04.065
I can get us a nice house.

01:02:05.667 --> 01:02:07.066
I can help you
open the restaurant.

01:02:07.068 --> 01:02:09.137
I can put Zack
in a good school.

01:02:12.807 --> 01:02:13.841
Easily.

01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:16.574
'Cause I know

01:02:16.576 --> 01:02:19.045
that we will fit together
so fucking good, baby.

01:02:19.047 --> 01:02:21.247
So fucking good.

01:02:21.249 --> 01:02:23.049
Come on, Avery.

01:02:23.051 --> 01:02:24.683
Come on, baby.

01:02:27.654 --> 01:02:29.188
Avery, come on! Fuck!

01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:30.190
Avery!

01:02:35.862 --> 01:02:37.030
You know what they say?

01:02:38.298 --> 01:02:40.867
You only lend money to friends,
if you don't expect it back.

01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:44.470
Five grand that's...

01:02:45.504 --> 01:02:47.140
That's a lot of money
to not have it come back.

01:03:22.741 --> 01:03:24.607
Pack your bags.
We're going.

01:03:24.609 --> 01:03:26.178
We're going right now.
We are going out west.

01:03:27.246 --> 01:03:28.980
I screwed up. I'm sorry.

01:03:30.116 --> 01:03:31.714
This is all on me.

01:03:31.716 --> 01:03:33.683
Just take
what you can carry.

01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:35.018
We'll ah...

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.054
We'll catch a bus.

01:03:36.988 --> 01:03:38.590
I'll figure out the rest later.

01:03:39.758 --> 01:03:41.059
No.

01:03:46.831 --> 01:03:50.833
Are you staying for Sean?

01:03:50.835 --> 01:03:51.803
Did you fuck him?

01:03:54.939 --> 01:03:55.907
I could have.

01:03:58.209 --> 01:04:00.544
That would have solved
all of our problems.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.715
But I didn't

01:04:09.686 --> 01:04:11.555
Something is
wrong with us, Ben.

01:04:15.659 --> 01:04:17.993
We felt much
better than When we left.

01:04:17.995 --> 01:04:19.628
And my shitty family

01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:22.230
and your dumb ass friends!

01:04:22.232 --> 01:04:24.134
Look at us!

01:04:27.404 --> 01:04:30.140
We think we're
so fucking special.

01:04:31.774 --> 01:04:33.576
We're just a couple of assholes.

01:04:46.122 --> 01:04:47.090
My mom...

01:04:48.758 --> 01:04:50.791
My mom will take us in.

01:04:50.793 --> 01:04:51.761
OK.

01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:54.328
OK.

01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:55.832
OK, let's go home.

01:04:57.233 --> 01:04:58.334
Let's go home.

01:05:00.836 --> 01:05:03.039
It's just Zack and me.

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:05.907
Alone.

01:05:11.947 --> 01:05:12.881
Ben.

01:05:16.284 --> 01:05:18.019
Either we're pulling you down,

01:05:20.689 --> 01:05:22.124
or you're pulling us down.

01:05:23.291 --> 01:05:25.093
I don't know which one

01:05:26.294 --> 01:05:27.729
but it doesn't matter.

01:05:34.102 --> 01:05:35.036
<i>Mom!</i>

01:05:40.007 --> 01:05:41.041
Hi, Zack.

01:05:42.009 --> 01:05:43.677
Why don't you go
back to sleep, OK?

01:05:45.247 --> 01:05:47.014
Are you and mom
getting a divorce?

01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:50.751
Is it because of my bike?

01:05:53.287 --> 01:05:54.922
It's OK if you didn't get it.

01:05:56.090 --> 01:05:57.091
I don't need it.

01:06:09.403 --> 01:06:11.436
Listen.

01:06:11.438 --> 01:06:13.472
I just want you to know

01:06:13.474 --> 01:06:14.408
that...

01:06:15.909 --> 01:06:17.076
You got into a fight.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.148
Don't touch me.

01:06:26.786 --> 01:06:28.986
What? Hey!

01:06:28.988 --> 01:06:30.221
Hey!

01:06:30.223 --> 01:06:31.255
I want mom!

01:06:31.257 --> 01:06:33.024
Wait! Wait!

01:06:33.026 --> 01:06:34.058
You're a liar!

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:35.094
Go away!

01:06:36.496 --> 01:06:38.064
I want mom!

01:07:38.923 --> 01:07:41.457
Jesus fucking mother of Mary.

01:07:41.459 --> 01:07:44.326
How does this cunt
not learn a lesson?

01:07:44.328 --> 01:07:46.128
Come on, Ben,
what the hell you still

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:47.131
doing out here?

01:07:48.399 --> 01:07:50.599
Woah, woah! What
the fuck are you doing?

01:07:50.601 --> 01:07:52.536
I'm buying my kid
a fucking bike!

01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:59.541
What the fuck?
No, don't touch my babies!

01:07:59.543 --> 01:08:01.278
You're so fucking dead!

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:17.358
Cute little Jack Rabbit
ain't so cute no more.

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.359
<i>6325.</i>

01:08:19.362 --> 01:08:21.928
<i>6325.
Go ahead.</i>

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:24.432
<i>I spotted motor vehicle accident
with injuries.</i>

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:26.198
<i>Queensway and Royal York.</i>

01:08:26.201 --> 01:08:27.868
<i>Two vehicles,
extended damages</i>

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:30.371
<i>red sports

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:31.508
<i>Ten-four.
I'm on my way.</i>

01:08:36.578 --> 01:08:39.014
<i>Jack Rabbit!</i>

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:17.318
Fucking!

01:09:47.346 --> 01:09:48.314
Come on!

01:10:06.265 --> 01:10:07.634
Yeah!

01:10:09.201 --> 01:10:11.505
Yeah!

01:10:15.541 --> 01:10:17.508
Fucker!

01:12:45.353 --> 01:12:47.554
<i>6325, I'm on scene.</i>

01:12:47.556 --> 01:12:48.823
Roger that, 6325

01:12:50.458 --> 01:12:52.727
<i>We have
two patients.</i>

01:12:53.662 --> 01:12:55.193
<i>Both vehicles
non-drivable</i>

01:12:55.195 --> 01:12:56.564
<i>hatch back
on the shoulder.</i>

01:12:57.866 --> 01:12:59.398
<i>I'm waiting
on a tow truck.</i>

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.567
<i>I can't open
the intersection</i>

01:13:01.569 --> 01:13:03.103
<i>until I get the
sports car out of here.</i>

01:13:09.577 --> 01:13:11.343
<i>911,
what's your emergency?</i>

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:13.113
<i>Police, fire or ambulance?</i>

01:13:17.384 --> 01:13:21.218
<i>Hello? Hello! 911.</i>

01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:22.754
<i>We are
tracking your location.</i>

01:13:22.756 --> 01:13:24.458
<i>Is there anyone
there who can help?</i>

01:14:25.384 --> 01:14:28.652
20, 40, 60, 80.

01:14:28.654 --> 01:14:31.621
20, 40, 60, 80.

01:14:31.623 --> 01:14:34.558
20, 40, 60, 80.

01:14:35.526 --> 01:14:38.295
20, 40, 60, 80.

01:14:38.997 --> 01:14:42.831
20, 40, 60, 80.

01:14:42.833 --> 01:14:45.503
20, 40, 60, 80.

01:15:04.789 --> 01:15:05.754
<i>Hello.</i>

01:15:05.756 --> 01:15:06.822
My name is Ben.

01:15:06.824 --> 01:15:08.589
I work for your husband.

01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:10.193
I want to talk
to you about him.

01:15:27.844 --> 01:15:28.878
Sign!

01:15:59.675 --> 01:16:00.676
<i>Who is it?</i>

01:16:01.744 --> 01:16:03.543
<i>Asshole!</i>

01:16:03.545 --> 01:16:04.811
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:16:04.813 --> 01:16:06.046
<i>Getting a back rub.</i>

01:16:06.048 --> 01:16:07.981
<i>Why would you do this?</i>

01:16:07.983 --> 01:16:10.418
- <i>Hey!</i>
- <i>What's wrong with you?</i>

01:16:56.363 --> 01:16:58.065
Did you hear
about that chaser Wayne?

01:16:59.133 --> 01:17:00.867
Ran a red light
and ran into a cab.

01:17:02.469 --> 01:17:03.436
Killed the driver.

01:17:05.138 --> 01:17:06.339
Killed the fare?

01:17:07.607 --> 01:17:08.842
Fares girlfriend is...

01:17:10.944 --> 01:17:12.012
still in shock.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:14.781
Here is a heads-up.

01:17:16.415 --> 01:17:19.820
Girlfriend says she saw a
Jack Rabbit truck at the scene.

01:17:27.927 --> 01:17:30.460
I think you're a
little bit heavy, no?

01:17:30.462 --> 01:17:31.630
It's an incentive.

01:17:32.698 --> 01:17:35.532
I think there's room
to expand our relationship.

01:17:35.534 --> 01:17:36.468
What?

01:17:37.369 --> 01:17:39.371
We'll need some
long term possibilities.

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:43.473
A garage, restaurant.

01:17:43.475 --> 01:17:44.210
Oh, no!

01:17:45.144 --> 01:17:46.779
Y'all got the
great leads right?

01:17:48.613 --> 01:17:51.581
I can't fund you
those kinds of loans.

01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:55.818
Do you like pushing
other guys money around, Ray?

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:58.023
Or do you want to
be one of these guys?

01:17:59.992 --> 01:18:01.691
I'm not looking for loans.

01:18:01.693 --> 01:18:02.861
I'm looking for a partner.

01:18:09.033 --> 01:18:10.633
<i>OK, sweetie!</i>

01:18:10.635 --> 01:18:11.567
<i>You really
shouldn't be here.</i>

01:18:13.671 --> 01:18:15.437
Fucking hell!

01:18:15.439 --> 01:18:17.773
Leave the keys,
and get the fuck off my lot!

01:18:17.775 --> 01:18:19.010
You ruined my family!

01:18:20.178 --> 01:18:21.578
It sucks, doesn't it?

01:18:25.183 --> 01:18:27.451
This is the wreck
I pulled in last night.

01:18:37.195 --> 01:18:38.760
Expensive divorce.

01:18:38.762 --> 01:18:41.129
No police contract.

01:18:41.131 --> 01:18:42.432
You need me.

01:18:44.968 --> 01:18:46.436
I'm staying on.

01:18:47.905 --> 01:18:48.939
As a chaser.

01:18:50.674 --> 01:18:51.773
I already
have a decent chaser

01:18:51.775 --> 01:18:53.576
who hasn't fucked me over.

01:18:54.845 --> 01:18:55.779
Yeah.

01:19:12.895 --> 01:19:14.795
It looks like that
decent chaser of yours

01:19:14.797 --> 01:19:17.631
just went on
a really long vacation.

01:19:17.633 --> 01:19:19.199
And the same
goes for any chaser

01:19:19.201 --> 01:19:21.938
you even think about
bringing on who isn't me.

01:19:23.105 --> 01:19:25.706
No, fucking way, man.
Not you.

01:19:25.708 --> 01:19:27.607
Not you. Not in my truck.

01:19:27.609 --> 01:19:28.878
My truck.

01:19:30.179 --> 01:19:32.779
The whole fleet
it's in your wife's name.

01:19:32.781 --> 01:19:34.148
She got a proof.

01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:35.051
I got my truck.

01:19:38.954 --> 01:19:40.820
And from now on

01:19:40.822 --> 01:19:41.723
I work nights.

01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:56.938
See you next week, Ben.

01:19:57.872 --> 01:19:59.305
See you next week, Ray.

01:19:59.307 --> 01:20:00.574
Hey, Ben!

01:20:01.309 --> 01:20:03.642
You're my
main guy now, man!

01:20:03.644 --> 01:20:05.844
I always knew
you had it in you!

01:20:05.846 --> 01:20:07.082
We're going to
make some money!

01:20:10.851 --> 01:20:12.153
Money is on the road.

01:21:39.838 --> 01:21:40.738
Kamal!

01:22:17.441 --> 01:22:18.775
I paid for it.

01:22:21.911 --> 01:22:22.879
How?
