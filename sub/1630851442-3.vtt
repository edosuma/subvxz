00:03.486 --> 00:05.350
Support your local PBS station.

00:20.779 --> 00:23.368
ARE YOU A
WISER MAN NOW THAN YOU WERE?

00:23.402 --> 00:25.577
MUCH WISER, MUCH WISER.

00:25.611 --> 00:29.443
THEY HAVE A SAYING,
"A WISE MAN CHANGE, BUT
A FOOL NEVER CHANGE."

00:29.477 --> 00:32.860
AND I'VE CHANGED BECAUSE
I'VE BECOME WISER.

00:32.894 --> 00:36.312
WELL, THEY SAY
THAT THE ROAD BACK IS A LOT

00:36.346 --> 00:38.417
HARDER THAN THE ROAD
UP THE FIRST TIME.

00:38.452 --> 00:40.799
DO YOU FEEL IT THAT WAY?

00:40.833 --> 00:44.492
IN MY MIND IT'S EASIER,
BUT IN MY BODY IT MIGHT
BE A LITTLE HARDER.

00:44.527 --> 00:47.495
BUT I HAVE TO COME BACK.
I'M GOING TO COME BACK.

00:47.530 --> 00:50.084
I'LL BE CONSIDERED MUCH
BETTER WHEN I COME BACK.

00:50.119 --> 00:53.432
I HAVE TOO MUCH TO FIGHT
FOR, CAUSE TO FIGHT FOR.

00:55.262 --> 01:02.131
I THINK
THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT
PART OF POST-EXILE ALI

01:02.165 --> 01:06.514
IS THIS QUEST TO
BE MADE WHOLE.

01:06.549 --> 01:08.620
THAT'S WHY THE CLIMB IS
SO IMPORTANT, SO VITAL.

01:08.654 --> 01:15.868
THAT'S WHY VICTORY MATTERS,
IS TO SEND THAT MESSAGE THAT

01:15.903 --> 01:19.182
HE'S THE ONE THAT YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO BREAK.

01:23.290 --> 01:24.912
THE CROWD ROARS NOW

01:24.946 --> 01:28.502
AS MUHAMMAD ALI
COMES DOWN THE AISLE.

01:28.536 --> 01:31.781
A MAN WHO HAS EVOKED
ALL KINDS OF PASSION,

01:31.815 --> 01:34.335
AGAINST AND FOR.

01:34.370 --> 01:37.373
ALI WHO KNOWS THAT HE'S
GOT A LOT TO PROVE.

01:37.407 --> 01:38.719
CROWD ROARING
THE CROWD REACTS!

01:40.790 --> 01:45.450
AND THIS IS NOT THE
USUAL ALI STYLE AT ALL.

01:45.484 --> 01:48.418
WHERE IS THAT ALI MOVEMENT?

01:48.453 --> 01:52.284
STRANGE THING TO SEE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

01:52.319 --> 01:55.667
ON DECEMBER 7, 1970,
MUHAMMAD ALI FOUGHT

01:55.701 --> 02:00.327
OSCAR BONAVENA AT NEW YORK
CITY'S MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.

02:00.361 --> 02:04.262
HE HAD ALREADY DEFEATED
JERRY QUARRY IN ATLANTA IN HIS

02:04.296 --> 02:07.748
RETURN FROM A 3 1/2-YEAR
BANISHMENT BY BOXING OFFICIALS

02:07.782 --> 02:11.545
FOR REFUSING INDUCTION INTO
THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES,

02:11.579 --> 02:16.929
A CRIME FOR WHICH HE STILL FACED
5 YEARS IN FEDERAL PRISON.

02:16.964 --> 02:21.693
AS SOON AS ALI STEPPED BACK
INTO THE RING AFTER HIS EXILE,

02:21.727 --> 02:25.352
BOXING AFICIONADOS,
TRAINERS, OTHER BOXERS NOTICED

02:25.386 --> 02:28.665
IMMEDIATELY THAT HE WAS
DIFFERENT, THAT HE WAS SLOWER.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.874
AND BECAUSE HE HAD NEVER
HAD GREAT TECHNIQUE,

02:30.909 --> 02:33.222
BECAUSE HE HAD
KEPT HIS HANDS TOO LOW

02:33.256 --> 02:36.397
AND HE HAD NEVER LEARNED
TO DUCK PUNCHES,

02:36.432 --> 02:38.537
THIS MADE HIM
MORE VULNERABLE.

02:38.572 --> 02:42.507
HE WAS GOING TO BE ABSORBING
MORE PUNISHMENT NOW,

02:42.541 --> 02:45.682
AND HE WAS GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
DIFFERENT WAYS TO WIN.

02:45.717 --> 02:49.203
AND NOW ALI IS
BEHAVING LIKE THE OLD ALI.

02:49.238 --> 02:50.998
IT'S OVER!

02:51.032 --> 02:53.621
ALI IS THE KNOCKOUT WINNER
AT 2 MINUTES AND 3 SEC...

02:53.656 --> 02:57.349
HE NEEDED
15 ROUNDS TO BEAT BONAVENA.

02:57.384 --> 02:59.317
"I TOOK EVERYTHING HE THREW,"

02:59.351 --> 03:01.560
ALI TOLD REPORTERS
AFTER THE FIGHT.

03:01.595 --> 03:04.391
"AND HE HITS HARD."

03:04.425 --> 03:06.945
"THAT WAS WHEN ALI
DISCOVERED SOMETHING

03:06.979 --> 03:10.293
WHICH WAS BOTH VERY GOOD
AND VERY BAD,"

03:10.328 --> 03:13.400
HIS FIGHT DOCTOR,
FERDIE PACHECO, SAID.

03:13.434 --> 03:15.678
"HE COULD TAKE A PUNCH."

03:27.310 --> 03:29.519
BY THE TIME
MUHAMMAD ALI HAD REGAINED

03:29.554 --> 03:33.696
HIS BOXING LICENSE IN 1970,
MANY AMERICANS HAD GROWN TIRED

03:33.730 --> 03:37.631
OF THE EVER-INCREASING BODY
COUNT, GRIM NEWS REPORTS,

03:37.665 --> 03:40.737
AND GRAPHIC IMAGERY COMING
BACK FROM THE FRONT LINES

03:40.772 --> 03:42.774
OF THE VIETNAM WAR.

03:42.808 --> 03:47.365
CIVIL UNREST IN NEWARK,
CHICAGO, DETROIT, AND MANY

03:47.399 --> 03:50.954
OTHER CITIES HAD FURTHER
LAID BARE AFRICAN-AMERICANS'

03:50.989 --> 03:54.924
DEEP FRUSTRATION WITH
THEIR SECOND-CLASS STATUS,

03:54.958 --> 03:57.996
WHILE THE NATION OF ISLAM,
THE SEPARATIST RELIGIOUS SECT

03:58.030 --> 04:00.757
THAT ALI CONTINUED
TO SUPPORT, HAD,

04:00.792 --> 04:04.727
SINCE THE DEATH OF MALCOLM X,
RETREATED FROM THE PUBLIC EYE,

04:04.761 --> 04:08.558
AND NOW SEEMED LESS THREATENING
TO WHITE AMERICA.

04:19.604 --> 04:22.710
BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES
TAKING PLACE IN THE COUNTRY--

04:22.745 --> 04:25.713
THE ANTI-VIETNAM WAR MOVEMENT
AND THE LIKE,

04:25.748 --> 04:28.613
THE RISE OF BLACK POWER
IN THE COUNTRY,

04:28.647 --> 04:32.513
THE RISE OF RADICALISM
IN THE COUNTRY,

04:32.548 --> 04:37.484
ALI SUDDENLY HAS A REAL AUDIENCE
AND A REAL SET OF FOLLOWERS

04:37.518 --> 04:40.970
IN A WAY THAT HE
DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE,

04:41.004 --> 04:45.595
AND HE NO LONGER IS SOMEONE
WHO'S SEEN IN AMERICAN CULTURE

04:45.630 --> 04:47.666
JUST AS TOTALLY A VILLAIN.

04:47.701 --> 04:51.808
HE'S NOW A HERO TO
A SIZABLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE,

04:51.843 --> 04:54.086
AND HE'S GONNA PLAY
TO THAT PARTICULAR SEGMENT

04:54.121 --> 04:56.813
OF AMERICAN SOCIETY.

04:56.848 --> 05:00.403
ALI WAS DETERMINED
TO REGAIN THE HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE,

05:00.438 --> 05:03.648
BUT HIS SENTENCE
FOR DRAFT EVASION LOOMED.

05:03.682 --> 05:08.515
OVER THE PAST 3 1/2 YEARS,
HE HAD LOST APPEAL AFTER APPEAL.

05:08.549 --> 05:11.897
NOW HIS LAST CHANCE
TO AVOID PRISON

05:11.932 --> 05:15.038
LAY WITH THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT,

05:15.073 --> 05:18.594
IF THEY WOULD EVEN AGREE
TO HEAR HIS CASE.

05:18.628 --> 05:20.872
RETURN
OF THE CHAMPION...

05:20.906 --> 05:24.358
ALI'S RETURN TO
BOXING HAD DEMONSTRATED THAT

05:24.393 --> 05:26.636
HE WAS STILL AN
ENORMOUS ATTRACTION.

05:26.671 --> 05:30.778
PEOPLE EVERYWHERE WERE EAGER
TO SEE THE MOST DOMINANT BOXER

05:30.813 --> 05:33.160
OF THE 1960s FIGHT AGAIN.

05:33.194 --> 05:35.473
MUHAMMAD ALI,
CASSIUS CLAY...

05:35.507 --> 05:38.683
WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT THE GREATEST FIGHTS,

05:38.717 --> 05:41.617
THERE ARE FIGHTS
THAT ARE PERFECT,

05:41.651 --> 05:45.068
AND THEN THERE ARE FIGHTS
THAT ARE DRAMATIC.

05:45.103 --> 05:49.521
HIS FIGHT EARLY ON
AGAINST CLEVELAND WILLIAMS
OR ZORA FOLLEY

05:49.556 --> 05:51.730
BEFORE HE'S TAKEN
OUT OF COMMISSION BECAUSE

05:51.765 --> 05:55.596
OF THE DRAFT DRAMA ARE
EXQUISITE AND PERFECT.

05:55.631 --> 05:58.427
THE SPEED IS THERE.
THE HAND SPEED IS THERE.

05:58.461 --> 06:00.083
THAT'S
THE ALI SHUFFLE.

06:00.118 --> 06:02.810
HE DOESN'T MAKE
A FALSE MOVE,

06:02.845 --> 06:04.674
AND THEN HE FINISHES IT OFF.

06:05.986 --> 06:09.645
THERE'S NO MORE
PERFECT PERFORMANCE.

06:09.679 --> 06:12.544
BUT IT'S NOT HOMERIC IN SCALE.

06:12.579 --> 06:17.135
IT DOESN'T COME WITH SUFFERING
AND GREAT OPPOSITION.

06:17.169 --> 06:21.450
SO THAT COMES IN
THE EARLY SEVENTIES.

06:21.484 --> 06:24.798
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT
ANY ATHLETE, IT'S NOT A REAL

06:24.832 --> 06:28.008
DISCUSSION UNLESS THEY
HAVE SOME RIVALRY.

06:28.042 --> 06:32.081
SO YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT
MUHAMMAD ALI WITHOUT TALKING

06:32.115 --> 06:34.083
ABOUT JOE FRAZIER.

06:34.117 --> 06:38.121
HIS RIVALRY IN ONE SENSE WAS
WITH THE SYSTEM, THE POWERS

06:38.156 --> 06:39.985
THAT BE, THE GOVERNMENT,

06:40.020 --> 06:44.507
BUT HIS SPORTS RIVAL
WAS JOE FRAZIER.

06:56.243 --> 06:59.971
ON DECEMBER 30,
1970, MUHAMMAD ALI,

07:00.005 --> 07:03.802
THE NUMBER-ONE HEAVYWEIGHT
CONTENDER, AND JOE FRAZIER,

07:03.837 --> 07:07.150
THE REIGNING WORLD CHAMPION,
MET IN NEW YORK

07:07.185 --> 07:09.981
TO ANNOUNCE THEIR
MUCH-ANTICIPATED TITLE FIGHT.

07:10.015 --> 07:12.259
I PREDICT THAT
WHEN I MEET JOE FRAZIER,

07:12.293 --> 07:14.675
THIS WILL BE
LIKE A GOOD AMATEUR

07:14.710 --> 07:16.643
FIGHTING A REAL PROFESSIONAL.

07:16.677 --> 07:19.784
THIS WILL BE LIKE A KID OUT
OF THE OLYMPICS MEETING

07:19.818 --> 07:22.511
THE FASTEST HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION THAT EVER LIVED.

07:22.545 --> 07:24.823
THIS WILL BE NO CONTEST.

07:24.858 --> 07:26.998
THEY'D SIGNED
THE LARGEST CONTRACT

07:27.032 --> 07:30.277
IN THE SPORT'S HISTORY,
GUARANTEEING THEM EACH

07:30.311 --> 07:32.555
$2.5 MILLION.

07:32.590 --> 07:35.144
NEVER BEFORE HAD TWO
UNDEFEATED CHAMPIONS

07:35.178 --> 07:37.974
FACED EACH OTHER FOR
THE HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE.

07:38.009 --> 07:41.944
IT WAS BILLED AS
"THE FIGHT OF THE CENTURY."

07:43.532 --> 07:45.948
TWO WEEKS LATER,
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

07:45.982 --> 07:49.745
ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WOULD HEAR
MUHAMMAD ALI'S APPEAL,

07:49.779 --> 07:54.232
KEEPING ALIVE THE SLIM HOPE
THAT HE MIGHT AVOID PRISON.

07:54.266 --> 07:57.960
JEAN KNIGHT'S "MR. BIG STUFF"
PLAYING

07:57.994 --> 08:03.068
ON JANUARY 13, 1971,
ALI ARRIVED IN MIAMI BEACH

08:03.103 --> 08:05.692
TO PREPARE FOR HIS
FIGHT WITH FRAZIER.

08:05.726 --> 08:09.937
ANGELO DUNDEE, ALI'S LONG-TIME
TRAINER, HAD ARRANGED

08:09.972 --> 08:13.838
FOR THE BOXER TO STAY
AT AN UPSCALE JEWISH
RETIREMENT COMMUNITY

08:13.872 --> 08:16.875
CALLED THE OCTAGON TOWERS.

08:16.910 --> 08:20.810
HE WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN-
AMERICAN EVER PERMITTED
TO LIVE THERE.

08:20.845 --> 08:24.573
MY MAN.
HE FEEDS ME KOSHER
FOOD EVERY DAY.

08:24.607 --> 08:26.782
YES, SIR.
AND IT'S GOOD, TOO.

08:26.816 --> 08:29.025
WHO ARE YOU FOR,
JOE FRAZIER OR ME?

08:29.060 --> 08:30.302
THEY TELL ME
JOE FRAZIER'S
THE NEW CHAMP.

08:30.337 --> 08:31.890
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
NOW WHO ARE YOU?

08:31.925 --> 08:33.582
I'M THE HEAVYWE--
WHO AM I?

08:33.616 --> 08:35.998
LAUGHTER
OHH!

08:41.624 --> 08:43.902
DUNDEE'S 5th STREET GYM,

08:43.937 --> 08:46.698
WHERE ALI HAD FIRST TRAINED
A DECADE EARLIER,

08:46.733 --> 08:51.600
BUSTLED WITH REPORTERS AND FANS,
EACH OF WHOM PAID $1.00 TO WATCH

08:51.634 --> 08:53.567
THE FIGHTER ENTERTAIN.

08:53.602 --> 08:56.087
ALI DID NOT DISAPPOINT.

09:01.368 --> 09:04.198
HE TOLD JOKES,
POSED FOR PHOTOGRAPHS,

09:04.233 --> 09:06.338
PERFORMED MAGIC TRICKS,

09:06.373 --> 09:09.997
AND DREW LAUGHS WHEN
HE MOCKINGLY IMITATED
JOE FRAZIER'S STYLE.

09:10.032 --> 09:11.999
HE'S TAKING 20 HEADSHOTS.

09:12.034 --> 09:15.762
"I NEVER WANTED TO
WHUP ANYBODY SO BAD," ALI SAID.

09:15.796 --> 09:19.628
"THE PEOPLE OF THE WHOLE
WORLD GONNA SEE WHO'S KING."

09:21.422 --> 09:24.840
THOUGH ALI HAD FOUGHT TWICE
IN THE PAST 3 MONTHS, HE WAS

09:24.874 --> 09:28.671
10 POUNDS OVER HIS PREFERRED
WEIGHT AND SEEMED UNINTERESTED

09:28.706 --> 09:31.087
IN GETTING IN SHAPE.

09:31.122 --> 09:35.126
"TRAINING WAS MOSTLY A PUBLICITY
STUNT," FERDIE PACHECO SAID.

09:35.160 --> 09:38.923
"HE TRAINED A LITTLE BIT
AND THEN HE TALKED A LOT."

09:40.338 --> 09:44.169
JOE'S GONNA COME OUT SMOKIN',
AND I AIN'T GONNA BE JOKIN'.

09:44.204 --> 09:48.035
I'LL BE PECKIN' AND A POKIN',
POURING WATER ON HIS SMOKIN'.

09:48.070 --> 09:51.314
THIS MIGHT SHOCK AND AMAZE YA,
BUT I WILL RETIRE JOE FRAZIER.

09:52.937 --> 09:55.111
WHEN I USED TO
WATCH MUHAMMAD FIGHT,

09:55.146 --> 09:56.872
I FELT CONFIDENT THAT
HE WAS GONNA WHOOP ANYBODY

09:56.906 --> 09:58.321
THAT GOT IN THAT RING.

09:58.356 --> 10:00.289
I DIDN'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT A THING.

10:00.323 --> 10:03.706
"BUT YOU'RE GETTING COCKY
AND YOU'RE NOT TRAINING LIKE

10:03.741 --> 10:05.881
"THE WAY YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE TRAINING.

10:05.915 --> 10:09.712
"YOU JUST TRYING TO CONVINCE
YOURSELF THAT YOU GONNA WIN,

10:09.747 --> 10:15.235
"BUT IT TAKES TRAINING AND HARD
WORK, AND YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT.

10:15.269 --> 10:17.064
"AND NOW YOU'RE NOT
TRAINING RIGHT,

10:17.099 --> 10:19.101
AND YOU MAKING ME
WORRIED NOW."

10:19.135 --> 10:20.240
HELLO, YOUNG LADY.

10:20.274 --> 10:21.344
HELLO, SIR.

10:21.379 --> 10:22.449
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?FINE.

10:22.483 --> 10:24.002
GOOD.

10:24.037 --> 10:25.797
THE CROWDS
AND THE CAMERAS WERE NOT

10:25.832 --> 10:28.317
ALI'S ONLY DISTRACTION.

10:28.351 --> 10:31.285
EVER SINCE HIS EXILE FROM
BOXING AND SUSPENSION FROM

10:31.320 --> 10:33.840
THE NATION OF ISLAM,
HE HAD BEEN CHEATING

10:33.874 --> 10:36.359
ON BELINDA FREQUENTLY.

10:36.394 --> 10:39.362
NO MATTER WHERE HE WENT,
WOMEN SOUGHT HIS ATTENTION

10:39.397 --> 10:42.952
AND AFFECTION, AND MEMBERS
OF HIS ENTOURAGE HELPED

10:42.987 --> 10:47.301
FEED HIS INCREASING
APPETITE FOR CASUAL SEX.

10:47.336 --> 10:49.441
BELINDA WAS HEARTBROKEN.

10:49.476 --> 10:52.790
SHE BEGAN HAVING
HER OWN AFFAIRS.

10:52.824 --> 10:55.102
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.

10:55.137 --> 11:00.349
I'M NOT PERFECT, AND I DON'T
EXPECT FOR HIM TO BE PERFECT.

11:00.383 --> 11:06.458
WHEN HE WAS TRAINING FOR THE
JOE FRAZIER FIGHT, GUYS WAS

11:06.493 --> 11:09.738
COMING AROUND TO THE CAMP,
UP TO NO GOOD,

11:09.772 --> 11:11.878
BRINGING HIM CHICKS.

11:11.912 --> 11:14.812
I SAID "MAN, THIS IS
NOT GONNA WORK.

11:16.020 --> 11:20.024
I PACKED MY BAGS, AND I
WENT BACK TO CHICAGO.

11:20.058 --> 11:22.474
THEY DON'T COME
TO SEE A TALKER.

11:22.509 --> 11:23.959
THEY SEEIN'
AND WATCHIN' A DOER.

11:23.993 --> 11:25.305
THAT'S RIGHT.

11:25.339 --> 11:27.134
NOW LET ME
GO TO WORK NOW.
YEAH.

11:29.965 --> 11:32.933
WHEN ASKED
BY A REPORTER IF HE HAD

11:32.968 --> 11:36.937
LOST A STEP, ALI REPLIED,
"I'M JUST AS SHARP...

11:36.972 --> 11:38.905
"I JUST FIGHT DIFFERENT NOW.

11:38.939 --> 11:41.390
"NOW I'M A MATURE MAN,
A STRONG MAN.

11:41.424 --> 11:44.117
THE DANCING IS NO
LONGER NECESSARY."

11:44.151 --> 11:46.188
I'M NOT JUST GONNA WHUP
FRAZIER, I'M GONNA WHUP ALL

11:46.222 --> 11:48.293
THE SO-CALLED EXPERTS.

11:48.328 --> 11:50.917
AFTER THIS ONE, THEY WILL
NEVER PREDICT AGAINST

11:50.951 --> 11:52.297
MUHAMMAD ALI.
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

11:52.332 --> 11:54.161
NEVER AGAIN.

11:54.196 --> 11:55.887
ALI DIDN'T THINK HE
WAS GONNA HAVE MUCH TROUBLE

11:55.922 --> 11:57.924
WITH JOE FRAZIER.
FRAZIER WAS SMALLER,

11:57.958 --> 11:59.995
HE WAS NOT A PRETTY FIGHTER.

12:00.029 --> 12:04.447
HE WAS THE GUY WHO JUST BULLED
HIS WAY IN, GOT UNDER YOUR CHIN,

12:04.482 --> 12:07.002
AND JUST POUNDED
AND POUNDED AND POUNDED.

12:07.036 --> 12:09.832
FRAZIER IS PUTTING
EVERYTHING INTO EVERY PUNCH.

12:09.867 --> 12:11.972
BUT HE HAD THIS
LEFT HOOK,

12:12.007 --> 12:14.216
AND WHEN HE THREW THAT HOOK,
IT JUST LANDED.

12:14.250 --> 12:17.944
IT'S MAYBE THE GREATEST LEFT
HOOK IN ALL OF BOXING HISTORY.

12:17.978 --> 12:19.773
THAT'S THE LEFT HOOK.

12:19.808 --> 12:22.500
AND ALI HAD ALWAYS BEEN
VULNERABLE TO THE LEFT HOOK,

12:22.534 --> 12:25.020
ALL HIS CAREER,
EVEN AS AN AMATEUR.

12:25.054 --> 12:27.885
LEFT HOOK WAS THE PUNCH
THAT HE HAD A HARD TIME SEEING

12:27.919 --> 12:30.991
AND HE'D BEEN HURT
BY IT MANY TIMES.

12:31.026 --> 12:34.063
SO THIS WAS A
DIFFICULT MATCH-UP.

12:34.098 --> 12:36.376
I WAS TALKING
TO MUHAMMAD ALI DOWN IN MIAMI

12:36.410 --> 12:37.895
EARLIER THIS WEEK,

12:37.929 --> 12:39.551
AND HE CALLED YOU
A GOOD STREET FIGHTER.

12:39.586 --> 12:41.830
DOES THAT MAKE YOU MAD?

12:41.864 --> 12:46.455
DON'T MAKE ME MAD AT ALL.

12:46.489 --> 12:49.458
JOE FRAZIER WAS
THE YOUNGEST OF 10 CHILDREN

12:49.492 --> 12:53.876
BORN TO A ONE-ARMED HANDYMAN
AND HIS WIFE, A FIELD HAND,

12:53.911 --> 12:56.603
IN SOUTH CAROLINA'S
LOW COUNTRY.

12:56.637 --> 12:59.951
AT 6, HE HAD SEEN
JOE LOUIS BOX

12:59.986 --> 13:03.921
IN AN EXHIBITION FIGHT
IN NEARBY BEAUFORT.

13:03.955 --> 13:07.545
LATER, HE FASHIONED A HEAVY
BAG FROM A BURLAP SACK,

13:07.579 --> 13:12.964
FILLING IT WITH SAND, CORNCOBS,
BRICKS--WHATEVER HE COULD FIND--

13:12.999 --> 13:16.278
THEN SPENT AN HOUR A DAY
WALLOPING IT.

13:16.312 --> 13:19.868
HIS UNCLE CALLED
HIM LITTLE JOE LOUIS.

13:19.902 --> 13:25.183
AT SCHOOL, UM, HE WAS THE
TOUGHEST GUY IN THE CLASS.

13:25.218 --> 13:27.047
AND WHEN THE BULLIES
WOULD COME TO TAKE

13:27.082 --> 13:28.946
THE OTHER KIDS'
LUNCH MONEY,

13:28.980 --> 13:31.155
HE WOULD DEFEND THEM.

13:31.189 --> 13:34.123
FRAZIER
QUIT SCHOOL AT 15,

13:34.158 --> 13:37.851
AND AFTER BRIEF STINTS PICKING
CROPS, WORKING CONSTRUCTION,

13:37.886 --> 13:40.647
AND LOADING CRATES
AT A COCA-COLA PLANT,

13:40.681 --> 13:45.100
HE LEFT SOUTH CAROLINA
IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING BETTER.

13:45.134 --> 13:49.069
IN PHILADELPHIA, HE MOVED
IN WITH AN AUNT, GOT A JOB

13:49.104 --> 13:52.417
AT A SLAUGHTERHOUSE,
AND, HOPING TO LOSE WEIGHT,

13:52.452 --> 13:55.904
BEGAN WORKING OUT AT A
POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUE GYM

13:55.938 --> 13:58.458
ON THE NORTH SIDE OF TOWN.

13:58.492 --> 14:02.393
ONE DAY, A FORMER AMATEUR
FIGHTER NAMED "YANK" DURHAM

14:02.427 --> 14:05.154
WATCHED FRAZIER SLUG
A HEAVY BAG.

14:05.189 --> 14:08.640
THOUGH THE TEENAGER WAS
PIGEON TOED, OVERWEIGHT, AND HAD

14:08.675 --> 14:12.437
SHORT ARMS FOR A FIGHTER,
DURHAM WAS IMPRESSED

14:12.472 --> 14:14.646
AND OFFERED TO TRAIN HIM.

14:14.681 --> 14:17.891
THE YOUNG BOXER PROVED
DEDICATED AND DISCIPLINED,

14:17.926 --> 14:19.962
RUNNING EACH MORNING
BEFORE HIS SHIFT

14:19.997 --> 14:22.551
AT THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE
AND TRAINING AT THE GYM

14:22.585 --> 14:25.105
LATE INTO THE NIGHT.

14:25.140 --> 14:29.006
WITHIN TWO MONTHS,
FRAZIER HAD ENTERED AND WON

14:29.040 --> 14:32.112
THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC
GOLDEN GLOVES TOURNAMENT.

14:32.147 --> 14:36.599
TWO YEARS LATER, IN 1964,
HE EARNED A GOLD MEDAL

14:36.634 --> 14:40.534
FIGHTING AS A HEAVYWEIGHT
AT THE TOKYO OLYMPICS.

14:40.569 --> 14:43.537
BACK IN PHILADELPHIA
THEY BEGAN CALLING HIM

14:43.572 --> 14:46.092
"THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE KID."

14:46.126 --> 14:51.683
IN AUGUST OF 1965, MARRIED
AND WITH 3 YOUNG CHILDREN,

14:51.718 --> 14:57.413
FRAZIER, NOW 21 YEARS OLD,
TURNED PROFESSIONAL.

14:57.448 --> 14:59.933
WILL IT BE MUCH OF
A DIFFERENCE FIGHTING PRO?

14:59.968 --> 15:02.936
THE ONLY THING I CAN SEE,
THE GLOVES IS A LITTLE LIGHTER.

15:02.971 --> 15:04.110
THAT'S ABOUT ALL.

15:04.144 --> 15:05.525
AND THE MONEY?

15:05.559 --> 15:08.079
WELL, UH, WELL,
THAT'LL BE GOOD, TOO.

15:08.114 --> 15:12.152
WE ALL COULD USE SOME OF THAT,
YOU KNOW, EVERY NOW AND THEN.

15:12.187 --> 15:16.329
JOE FRAZIER,
FOUGHT BEYOND WHAT HE WAS.

15:16.363 --> 15:19.366
HE REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN THAT COMPETITIVE IN--

15:19.401 --> 15:22.680
IN THE HEAVYWEIGHT DIVISION,
CONSIDERING HIS SIZE, YOU KNOW,

15:22.714 --> 15:26.097
CONSIDERING HIS TALENTS,
YOU KNOW?

15:26.132 --> 15:32.517
BUT HE WAS, BECAUSE HE WAS ALSO
A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH.

15:32.552 --> 15:36.073
NOT A POLITICAL FORCE,
NOT AN INTELLECTUAL FORCE,

15:36.107 --> 15:40.215
JUST A BOXING FORCE,
BUT A FORCE OF NATURE.

15:41.733 --> 15:45.772
FRAZIER WON HIS
FIRST 24 FIGHTS AND HAD

15:45.806 --> 15:49.017
ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS A
CONTENDER FOR THE HEAVYWEIGHT

15:49.051 --> 15:53.090
CHAMPIONSHIP THAT HAD BEEN
STRIPPED FROM MUHAMMAD ALI.

15:53.124 --> 15:57.335
THERE HAD BEEN A
TOURNAMENT TO SUCCEED ALI.

15:57.370 --> 16:00.235
HIS OLD SPARRING PARTNER
AND FRIEND JIMMY ELLIS

16:00.269 --> 16:02.271
WON THAT TOURNAMENT.

16:02.306 --> 16:05.619
THEN ELLIS FOUGHT FRAZIER.

16:05.654 --> 16:08.277
FRAZIER KNOCKED HIM OUT
IN THE 4th ROUND,

16:08.312 --> 16:11.556
AND FRAZIER BECAME
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION.

16:11.591 --> 16:15.457
SO A FRAZIER-ALI
FIGHT WAS INEVITABLE.

16:15.491 --> 16:18.046
WHOEVER CLAIMED
TO BE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION

16:18.080 --> 16:20.220
WAS INAUTHENTIC,
AUTOMATICALLY.

16:20.255 --> 16:22.636
WITHOUT BEING
CHALLENGED BY ALI,

16:22.671 --> 16:25.536
THERE WAS NO VALIDITY
TO THEIR TITLE.

16:25.570 --> 16:28.159
WELL, I CONSIDER
MYSELF THE HEAVYWEIGHT

16:28.194 --> 16:33.061
CHAMPION OF THE WORLD UNTIL THE
CHAMP GETS BACK IN ACTION AGAIN.

16:33.095 --> 16:38.307
JOE FRAZIER
EMERGES AS THE GUY

16:38.342 --> 16:41.034
PEOPLE THINK CAN BEAT ALI.

16:41.069 --> 16:42.587
FRAZIER IS A VERY
GOOD FIGHTER.

16:42.622 --> 16:44.520
DOWN GOES ELLIS.

16:44.555 --> 16:47.316
I THINK IT WAS NORMAN MAILER WHO
CALLED HIM "THE WAR MACHINE,"

16:47.351 --> 16:50.112
AND, UH, THAT'S A
VERY APT, UH, EXPRESSION,

16:50.147 --> 16:51.251
HE WAS A WAR MACHINE.

16:51.286 --> 16:52.701
FRAZIER IS STRONG.

16:52.735 --> 16:54.220
HE CAME AT YOU
VERY AGGRESSIVELY.

16:54.254 --> 16:55.497
FRAZIER AGAIN
WITH THE LEFT.

16:55.531 --> 16:56.774
HE'S REALLY
RELENTLESS.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.534
ELLIS
STANDING THERE, OH!

16:58.569 --> 17:01.399
A TREMENDOUS LEFT HOOK.
IT IS OVER.

17:01.434 --> 17:03.263
"I'M GONNA RETIRE,"
FRAZIER HAD SAID

17:03.298 --> 17:05.300
AFTER KNOCKING OUT ELLIS.

17:05.334 --> 17:08.648
"I'M GONNA SING ROCK 'N ROLL
UNTIL THAT MUHAMMAD ALI

17:08.682 --> 17:12.790
OR CASSIUS CLAY OR WHATEVER
HIS NAME IS CAN FIGHT ME."

17:15.793 --> 17:19.383
MUHAMMAD ALI AND JOE FRAZIER
HAD BEEN CIRCLING EACH OTHER

17:19.417 --> 17:23.732
EVER SINCE THEY'D MET AT
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN IN 1967.

17:23.766 --> 17:26.838
THEN, THE YOUNGER
FIGHTER HAD ASKED ALI

17:26.873 --> 17:30.566
FOR AN AUTOGRAPH AND
PROMISED THAT, IN TWO YEARS,

17:30.601 --> 17:33.742
HE WOULD BE READY
TO FACE THE CHAMP.

17:33.776 --> 17:38.229
DURING HIS EXILE, ALI HAD
HOUNDED FRAZIER MERCILESSLY,

17:38.264 --> 17:42.199
TURNING UP AT HIS PHILADELPHIA
GYM, CHALLENGING HIM TO FIGHT,

17:42.233 --> 17:45.098
TAUNTING HIM ON TV AND RADIO.

17:45.133 --> 17:49.206
I JUST CANNOT WAIT
UNTIL THE BELL RING.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.277
I'VE NEVER WANTED TO
WHUP A MAN SO BAD.

17:51.311 --> 17:53.417
I'LL FIGHT...IN THE ALLEY.ANYWHERE.

17:53.451 --> 17:55.315
I WANT TO PROVE THAT JOE
FRAZIER'S NOT THE HEAVYWEIGHT

17:55.350 --> 17:57.110
CHAMPION OF THE WORLD.

17:57.145 --> 18:00.217
WE HAVE TO WHUP JOE FRAZIER
BECAUSE JOE FRAZIER IS

18:00.251 --> 18:01.735
TOO UGLY TO BE THE WORLD'S
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION.

18:03.496 --> 18:05.360
HE WANTS TO
KNOW WHAT HAPPENS, MUHAMMAD,

18:05.394 --> 18:08.846
IF INDEED THINGS
DON'T WORK OUT AS YOU
THINK THEY'RE GOING TO

18:08.880 --> 18:11.676
AND FRAZIER,
UH, DOES YOU IN?

18:11.711 --> 18:13.678
NEXT QUESTION.

18:16.923 --> 18:20.340
JOE FRAZIER SET
UP CAMP AT THE CONCORD HOTEL

18:20.375 --> 18:23.240
IN THE FRIGID CATSKILL
MOUNTAINS OF NEW YORK,

18:23.274 --> 18:28.245
WHERE HE WOKE EACH MORNING
BEFORE DAWN AND RAN 4.5 MILES.

18:28.279 --> 18:31.696
IN THE AFTERNOON, HE BATTERED
MULTIPLE SPARRING PARTNERS,

18:31.731 --> 18:36.805
CHOSEN FOR THEIR ABILITY TO
MIMIC ALI'S SPEED AND STYLE.

18:36.839 --> 18:39.808
WHEN A SNOWSTORM MADE IT
IMPOSSIBLE FOR FRAZIER TO

18:39.842 --> 18:43.432
TRAIN OUTSIDE, HE RETURNED
TO HIS GYM IN PHILADELPHIA,

18:43.467 --> 18:47.505
WHERE HIS FANS COULD WATCH AS
"YANK" DURHAM PUT HIM THROUGH

18:47.540 --> 18:50.715
ONE GRUELING EXERCISE
AFTER ANOTHER.

18:51.992 --> 18:54.478
"WHY IS IT THAT CLAY
GETS SO MUCH SPACE?"

18:54.512 --> 18:56.238
FRAZIER COMPLAINED.

18:56.273 --> 18:58.758
"HE SAYS SOMETHING,
AND IT'S IN THE PAPER,

18:58.792 --> 19:02.624
FRONT, BACK AND SIDEWAYS."

19:02.658 --> 19:05.903
A LOT OF THEM WANT ME
WHUPPED BECAUSE OF THE DRAFT.

19:07.732 --> 19:10.632
A LOT OF THEM WANT ME WHUPPED
BECAUSE OF RELIGION.

19:12.012 --> 19:15.982
A LOT OF THEM WANT ME
WHUPPED BECAUSE I'M BLACK...

19:16.016 --> 19:18.536
AND FOR OTHER REASONS THAT
I MIGHT NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT.

19:20.228 --> 19:23.541
ALI SCRIPTS THIS
SORT OF THING IN COMING BACK.

19:23.576 --> 19:26.510
HE'S NOW THE, UH,
THE ANTI-WAR HERO.

19:26.544 --> 19:29.478
HE'S THE PERSON WHO'S
SACRIFICED YEARS OF HIS CAREER

19:29.513 --> 19:31.342
BECAUSE OF HIS BELIEFS.

19:31.377 --> 19:34.483
SO HE'S NOT SEEN AS SOME KIND
OF ORDINARY DRAFT DODGER.

19:34.518 --> 19:37.210
HE'S SEEN AS SOMEONE WHO
HAS STOOD UP FOR HIS BELIEFS

19:37.245 --> 19:39.281
AND WAS WILLING TO PAY
THE PRICE FOR HIS BELIEFS.

19:39.316 --> 19:41.283
YOU KNOW, HE SAID,
"I'M WILLING TO GO TO JAIL.

19:41.318 --> 19:43.423
IF THEY WANT TO PUT ME IN JAIL,
I'M WILLING TO GO TO JAIL".

19:43.458 --> 19:46.392
HE'S NOT SOMEBODY WHO'S TRYING
TO DUCK OUT OF ANY OF THIS.

19:46.426 --> 19:49.947
SO HE, IN THIS WAY, BECOMES
A KIND OF MARTYR FIGURE.

19:49.981 --> 19:53.502
THIS IS WHAT FRAZIER
IS UP AGAINST.

19:53.537 --> 19:56.333
AS THE FIGHT
APPROACHED, ALI INCREASED HIS

19:56.367 --> 19:59.474
ATTACKS ON FRAZIER, CALLING
HIM IGNORANT AND THE FAVORITE

19:59.508 --> 20:01.338
OF WHITE SOUTHERNERS.

20:01.372 --> 20:03.995
THE ONLY PERSON FRAZIER
WOULD HEAR FROM IF HE WON,

20:04.030 --> 20:07.309
ALI CLAIMED,
WAS RICHARD NIXON.

20:07.344 --> 20:08.793
JOE FRAZIER,

20:08.828 --> 20:10.519
THE HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION OF THE WORLD--

20:10.554 --> 20:13.453
CLUMSY, UGLY,
FLATFOOTED JOE FRAZIER.

20:13.488 --> 20:15.593
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT
A REAL CHAMPION IS.

20:15.628 --> 20:17.388
ALI, RELISHED
THOSE KINDS OF CONTRASTS.

20:17.423 --> 20:18.562
FORGOT HOW GOOD I WAS...

20:18.596 --> 20:20.288
HE MADE THEM ALL THE TIME.

20:20.322 --> 20:21.875
HE MADE THEM
WITH FRAZIER.

20:21.910 --> 20:24.913
AND MANY WAYS, VERY UGLY
CONTRASTS, YOU KNOW.

20:24.947 --> 20:26.501
HE CAN'T WHOOP ME.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

20:26.535 --> 20:28.503
IN MANY WAYS, RACIST.

20:28.537 --> 20:31.506
BUT HE GOT AWAY WITH IT
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE WAS ALI

20:31.540 --> 20:34.474
AND ANY ENEMY OF ALI IS
AN ENEMY OF MINE, YOU KNOW.

20:35.786 --> 20:38.685
SPORTSWRITER
DICK YOUNG ACCUSED ALI

20:38.720 --> 20:41.999
OF WHITEWASHING FRAZIER,
CALLING HIS VERBAL BARRAGE

20:42.033 --> 20:44.415
"CRUEL AND UNWORTHY."

20:44.450 --> 20:48.039
"HE'S GOT THEM SO FOOLED,"
FRAZIER SAID, "THEY DON'T KNOW

20:48.074 --> 20:49.765
"IF THEY'RE COMING OR GOING.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.596
"I WAS BORN UNDER
THIS RACISM THING.

20:52.630 --> 20:56.393
I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY
PREACH TO ME THE DIFFERENCE."

20:56.427 --> 20:58.533
IT WAS THE BIGGEST FIGHT
BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME

20:58.567 --> 21:01.432
YOU'VE HAD A REALLY QUICK,
FAST-TALKING HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMP

21:01.467 --> 21:02.916
WHEN THE MOST OF 'EM
ANSWER THE QUESTION

21:02.951 --> 21:05.402
"HOW DO YOU FEEL CHAMP?"
"DAH, DUH, DUH DAH."

21:11.925 --> 21:14.652
HE TRIED TO DO
EVERYTHING AND SAY EVERYTHING

21:14.687 --> 21:17.655
TO PUT ME DOWN,
IN WHICH I DON'T AGREE WITH IT

21:17.690 --> 21:19.588
AND I THINK THAT THE GUY TALK

21:19.623 --> 21:22.936
FROM THE SIDE OF HIS MOUTH,
AND HE'S A PHONY.

21:22.971 --> 21:26.423
FRAZIER
SAID, "WHEN ALI WAS A KID,

21:26.457 --> 21:28.045
"THEY STOLE HIS BIKE.

21:28.079 --> 21:30.668
"SO HE HAD TO GO
BECOME A BOXER.

21:30.703 --> 21:32.946
WHO HAD A BIKE?"
HE WAS 13 YEARS OLD.

21:32.981 --> 21:36.053
"I WAS WORKIN' IN THE FIELDS,
FOR A FULL DAY, 13 YEARS OLD.

21:36.087 --> 21:39.056
"I LEFT THE SOUTH AT 15.

21:39.090 --> 21:41.127
"I WORKED IN THE
SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

21:41.161 --> 21:44.475
"YOU KNOW, I WORKED
IN BLOOD UP TO MY ANKLES.

21:44.510 --> 21:46.374
"AND THIS GUY NEVER HAD
A JOB IN HIS LIFE.

21:46.408 --> 21:48.790
"HE WAS THE PAMPERED DARLING
OF THE RICH PEOPLE

21:48.824 --> 21:50.792
OF LOUISVILLE."

21:50.826 --> 21:56.522
SO JOE HAD A CHIP LIKE ATLAS
CARRIED ON HIS SHOULDER.

21:56.556 --> 22:01.941
I THINK THAT JOE
WAS ALWAYS UPSET BY BEING

22:01.975 --> 22:06.566
DISRESPECTED,
SPECIFICALLY IN THAT WAY.

22:06.601 --> 22:10.777
NOW, ALI TRASH-TALKED
EVERYBODY,

22:10.812 --> 22:12.848
MADE UP NAMES FOR THEM.

22:12.883 --> 22:18.647
BUT NEVER BEFORE SO,
AH, RACIALLY DISRESPECTFUL.

22:18.682 --> 22:22.444
AND HE NEVER QUIT DOING IT.

22:22.479 --> 22:24.170
AND HERE WAS JOE WHO
WANTED TO BE FRIENDS.

22:24.204 --> 22:27.863
HERE WAS JOE WHO HAD LENT
HIM MONEY DURING THE EXILE.

22:27.898 --> 22:31.971
HERE WAS JOE WHO, YOU KNOW,
REACHED OUT IN VARIOUS WAYS,

22:32.005 --> 22:36.803
A GOOD-HEARTED MAN, AND HE WAS
CONSTANTLY BEING SLAPPED DOWN.

22:36.838 --> 22:41.083
JOE FRAZIER'S SO UGLY,
HIS FACE SHOULD BE DONATED TO

22:41.118 --> 22:42.671
THE BUREAU OF WILDLIFE.

22:45.812 --> 22:50.092
ALI IS MAKING
THE SORT OF JOKES THAT

22:50.127 --> 22:54.580
RACIST WHITE PEOPLE
WOULD MAKE ABOUT A BLACK
PERSON'S APPEARANCE.

22:54.614 --> 22:58.204
AND HE'S MAKING JOKES ABOUT
HIS LACK OF INTELLIGENCE.

22:58.238 --> 23:03.071
THE ULTIMATE CONSCIOUS BLACK
GUY IS ENGAGING IN BANTER

23:03.105 --> 23:09.767
THAT IS BASICALLY PLAYING
TO THE SIDE OF THE RACIST.

23:09.802 --> 23:13.599
AND SO I THINK THERE'S
A CONTRADICTION BETWEEN

23:13.633 --> 23:17.188
HIS PUBLIC POLITICS AND THE
WAY HE'S TREATING FRAZIER.

23:17.223 --> 23:20.985
AND THIS IS COMPOUNDED BY THE
FACT THAT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE,

23:21.020 --> 23:23.850
CONSERVATIVE WHITES,
FOR INSTANCE, FRAZIER IS

23:23.885 --> 23:27.095
THE PERSON THEY'RE EMBRACING,
NOT BECAUSE THEY LIKE FRAZIER,

23:27.129 --> 23:29.235
BUT BECAUSE HE'S
GOING AGAINST ALI.

23:29.269 --> 23:33.515
AND SO I THINK IT'S HARD
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO EMBRACE ALI.

23:33.550 --> 23:35.586
YOU WANT TO EMBRACE
WHAT HE REPRESENTS.

23:35.621 --> 23:39.245
BUT LOOKING BACK ON IT IN
HINDSIGHT, I THINK THE WAY HE

23:39.279 --> 23:42.973
PLAYED JOE FRAZIER WAS VERY
UNFORTUNATE AND REFLECTIVE

23:43.007 --> 23:44.630
OF THE DARK SIDE
OF MUHAMMAD ALI.

23:44.664 --> 23:46.494
HE COULD BE VERY CRUEL.

23:46.528 --> 23:49.566
JOE FRAZIER WAS NOT
SO WELL-SPOKEN.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.776
HE CERTAINLY WAS NOT
CHARISMATIC LIKE ALI.

23:52.810 --> 23:57.125
I JUST FEEL LIKE IN
THAT INSTANCE, HE USED
HIS POWERS FOR EVIL,

23:57.159 --> 23:59.230
AS OPPOSED TO
USING THEM FOR GOOD.

23:59.265 --> 24:00.818
NOW, YOU
AIN'T THE CHAMP...

24:00.853 --> 24:02.544
WHEN HE
GETS INTO THE RING,

24:02.579 --> 24:05.271
ALI EXPLAINED, "FRAZIER
WILL FEEL LIKE A TRAITOR.

24:05.305 --> 24:09.482
"HE WILL REALIZE THAT
MUHAMMAD ALI IS THE REAL CHAMP.

24:09.517 --> 24:10.690
"HE DON'T HAVE NOTHING.

24:10.725 --> 24:13.521
BUT ME...I HAVE A CAUSE."

24:13.555 --> 24:14.936
WAIT TILL I
GET YOU IN THE RING.

24:14.970 --> 24:16.834
A LOT OF IT
CAME DOWN TO

24:16.869 --> 24:19.147
WHO WAS AUTHENTICALLY BLACK.

24:19.181 --> 24:22.046
THE WHOLE CONCERN AT THE TIME
WAS PART OF AN ANXIETY THAT

24:22.081 --> 24:24.842
BLACK PEOPLE WERE GOING
THROUGH ABOUT THEIR IDENTITY

24:24.877 --> 24:27.707
AND ABOUT WHO THEY WERE AND
ABOUT WHAT IT MEANT TO BE BLACK.

24:27.742 --> 24:32.160
AND THIS--THIS ANXIETY
WOUND UP BEING PLAYED OUT

24:32.194 --> 24:35.819
DRAMATICALLY IN THE RING
WITH THESE TWO FIGHTERS.

24:35.853 --> 24:37.683
FRAZIER JUST
WANTED TO KILL ALI,

24:37.717 --> 24:39.616
I MEAN, REALLY KILL HIM.

24:39.650 --> 24:41.825
HE SAID, "I'M GONNA PUNCH HIM
TILL HIS INTESTINES START

24:41.859 --> 24:43.205
COMING OUT THE BACK."

24:43.240 --> 24:45.622
HE WAS SO ANGRY.

24:45.656 --> 24:48.694
AND ALI BELIEVED THAT THAT ANGER
WOULD WORK TO ALI'S ADVANTAGE,

24:48.728 --> 24:50.040
NOT FRAZIER'S.

24:52.145 --> 24:54.769
AS HE
WOUND DOWN HIS TRAINING,

24:54.803 --> 24:57.979
ALI'S NEIGHBORS AT THE
OCTAGON TOWERS THREW HIM

24:58.013 --> 24:59.808
A GOING-AWAY PARTY.

24:59.843 --> 25:03.156
THE RESIDENTS HAD GROWN TO
ADORE HIM AND SENT HIM OFF

25:03.191 --> 25:06.125
WITH A CAKE FEATURING
ALI STANDING OVER

25:06.159 --> 25:08.092
A FALLEN OPPONENT.

25:08.127 --> 25:11.993
"I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, A PRIZE
FIGHTER," MARVELED ONE WOMAN.

25:12.027 --> 25:14.996
"HE SEEMS LIKE A
NICE JEWISH BOY."

25:16.756 --> 25:21.934
ON MARCH 3rd, 5 DAYS BEFORE THE
FIGHT, A LIMOUSINE WHISKED ALI

25:21.968 --> 25:25.351
FROM THE AIRPORT TO HIS
MIDTOWN MANHATTAN HOTEL

25:25.385 --> 25:27.698
AND THEN TO MADISON
SQUARE GARDEN

25:27.733 --> 25:30.183
FOR A PRE-FIGHT PHYSICAL.

25:30.218 --> 25:33.290
WHEN A THRONG OF ADMIRERS
ENGULFED THE BOXER,

25:33.324 --> 25:35.223
HIS BODYGUARDS AND THE POLICE

25:35.257 --> 25:37.915
HAD TO OPEN A PATH
INTO THE ARENA,

25:37.950 --> 25:41.850
WHERE HUNDREDS OF REPORTERS AND
PHOTOGRAPHERS AWAITED HIM.

25:43.887 --> 25:47.373
IN THE DRESSING ROOM AFTER THE
EXAM, ALI'S HANDLERS STRUGGLED

25:47.407 --> 25:50.618
TO KEEP THE CRUSH OF
CELEBRITIES, BOXING OFFICIALS,

25:50.652 --> 25:52.896
ACQUAINTANCES,
MUSLIM ASSOCIATES,

25:52.930 --> 25:54.656
AND AUTOGRAPH SEEKERS

25:54.691 --> 25:57.590
FROM SMOTHERING THE BOXER,
WHO BARELY HAD ROOM TO

25:57.625 --> 26:00.213
GET CHANGED BACK INTO
HIS STREET CLOTHES.

26:02.181 --> 26:05.840
AS ALI'S LIMOUSINE INCHED AWAY
FROM THE ARENA, FANS YANKED

26:05.874 --> 26:09.119
AT THE DOOR HANDLES, BEAT
ON THE WINDOWS, AND CLIMBED

26:09.153 --> 26:11.121
ATOP THE ROOF.

26:11.155 --> 26:15.263
ONE LONG-HAIRED ADMIRER IN
A TATTERED ARMY JACKET CHASED

26:15.297 --> 26:18.680
THE CAR FOR BLOCKS, UNTIL
FINALLY, AT A STOPLIGHT,

26:18.715 --> 26:21.752
ALI LOWERED THE WINDOW
AND OFFERED HIS HAND.

26:21.787 --> 26:25.411
"HEY, CHAMP, YOU'RE MY MAN!"
THE YOUNG MAN YELLED.

26:27.171 --> 26:29.242
THE CITY WAS
IN A FEVERED FRENZY.

26:29.277 --> 26:34.731
RINGSIDE SEATS HAD GONE
FOR $150-- 1 1/2 TIMES

26:34.765 --> 26:37.837
WHAT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
HAD EVER CHARGED BEFORE--

26:37.872 --> 26:42.739
AND SCALPERS WERE
ASKING UP TO $700.

26:42.773 --> 26:47.019
WHEN THE GARDEN PUT THE FINAL
4,000 TICKETS ON SALE, FANS,

26:47.053 --> 26:50.091
WHO HAD WAITED OVERNIGHT IN
NEAR-FREEZING TEMPERATURES,

26:50.125 --> 26:53.646
BOUGHT THEM ALL
WITHIN TWO HOURS.

26:53.681 --> 26:57.719
300 MILLION PEOPLE ON 5
CONTINENTS WERE EXPECTED TO

26:57.754 --> 27:00.342
SEE THE BOUT THROUGH
CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION

27:00.377 --> 27:02.068
OR BY SATELLITE BROADCAST.

27:03.898 --> 27:05.934
MORE THAN HALF
OF THE 1,500 REQUESTS

27:05.969 --> 27:09.179
FOR MEDIA CREDENTIALS
HAD TO BE DENIED.

27:09.213 --> 27:10.836
THERE WAS NO ROOM.

27:12.907 --> 27:15.875
"IT'S
A CLASSIC CONFRONTATION
IN PRIZE FIGHTING

27:15.910 --> 27:19.016
"BETWEEN A MAN WHO CAN HIT
AND A MAN WHO IS ADEPT

27:19.051 --> 27:22.019
AT NOT GETTING HIT,"
ARGUED ONE SPORTSWRITER,

27:22.054 --> 27:25.195
"THE BEST OF ALL
POSSIBLE MATCHMAKING."

27:25.229 --> 27:27.231
NOW I THINK CLAY'S
GONNA WIN. I REALLY DO.

27:27.266 --> 27:28.785
FRAZIER.
WHY?

27:28.819 --> 27:30.372
I JUST THINK
HE'S IN BETTER SHAPE.

27:30.407 --> 27:33.686
CLAY SHOULD BEAT HIM
WITH SPEED AND JAB HIM GOOD.

27:33.721 --> 27:35.274
WELL, I THINK
IT'LL BE FRAZIER.

27:35.308 --> 27:38.760
I SORTA LIKE CLAY.
I LIKE TO HEAR HIM.

27:40.451 --> 27:43.144
"MUHAMMAD ALI
TRANSCENDS THE FIGHTER.

27:43.178 --> 27:46.872
HE IS WITHOUT PEER," WROTE
THE SPORTSWRITER MARK KRAM,

27:46.906 --> 27:50.807
WHO ALSO CALLED JOE FRAZIER
"THE FINEST GLADIATOR--

27:50.841 --> 27:52.912
"IN THE PUREST
SENSE OF THE WORD--

27:52.947 --> 27:54.845
IN HEAVYWEIGHT HISTORY."

27:54.880 --> 27:59.850
LAS VEGAS ODDSMAKERS
GAVE FRAZIER THE EDGE.

27:59.885 --> 28:02.991
I'M
COOL MAN, YEAH.

28:03.026 --> 28:05.442
I'M READY FOR THIS ONE.

28:05.476 --> 28:08.065
IT WAS THE FIGHT
OF THE CENTURY.

28:08.100 --> 28:11.759
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT
TWO UNDEFEATED CHAMPIONS
HAD EVER MET.

28:11.793 --> 28:13.795
ALI WAS CHAMPION WHEN
HE WAS STRIPPED OF HIS TITLE

28:13.830 --> 28:15.521
AND HAD NEVER LOST.

28:15.555 --> 28:20.284
FRAZIER HAD WON THE OLYMPICS
IN '64 AND HAD NEVER LOST

28:20.319 --> 28:25.048
AND IT WAS A $5 MILLION PURSE,
WHICH WAS JUST UNHEARD OF.

28:25.082 --> 28:28.396
ALI WOULD MAKE MORE MONEY
IN ONE FIGHT THAN HANK AARON

28:28.430 --> 28:31.364
EARNED IN HIS ENTIRE CAREER
PLAYING MORE THAN TWO DECADES

28:31.399 --> 28:33.090
OF BASEBALL.

28:33.125 --> 28:36.128
SO THIS WAS AN
UNBELIEVABLE SPECTACLE.

28:38.199 --> 28:42.099
ON THE EVE
OF THE FIGHT, JOE FRAZIER
STRUMMED A GUITAR

28:42.134 --> 28:44.412
AND RELAXED WITH
FRIENDS IN HIS SUITE

28:44.446 --> 28:48.347
AT AN UNDISCLOSED HOTEL WHERE HE
HAD BEEN MOVED AFTER THREATS

28:48.381 --> 28:51.212
WERE MADE AGAINST HIS LIFE.

28:51.246 --> 28:55.078
AT THE HOTEL NEW YORKER,
MUHAMMAD ALI AND HIS ENTOURAGE

28:55.112 --> 28:58.322
HAD TAKEN OVER THE
ENTIRE 25th FLOOR.

28:58.357 --> 29:01.774
THE LOBBY BUSTLED WITH REPORTERS
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD,

29:01.809 --> 29:05.329
MANY STILL SEEKING
CREDENTIALS FOR THE FIGHT.

29:05.364 --> 29:10.162
UPSTAIRS, ALI, SURROUNDED BY
HIS INNER CIRCLE, ENTERTAINED

29:10.196 --> 29:12.302
A HANDFUL OF WRITERS.

29:12.336 --> 29:14.476
"MY PEOPLE ARE FOR ME,"
HE TOLD THEM.

29:14.511 --> 29:16.789
"THEY IDENTIFY
WITH MY STRUGGLE.

29:16.824 --> 29:19.378
"SAME ONE THEY'RE FIGHTING
EVERY DAY IN THE STREETS

29:19.412 --> 29:21.242
"AND AGAINST THE POLICE.

29:21.276 --> 29:23.140
"IF I WIN, THEY WIN.

29:23.175 --> 29:26.247
IF I LOSE, THEY LOSE."

29:26.281 --> 29:32.322
EARLY ON THE EVENING OF MARCH
8, 1971, MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

29:32.356 --> 29:34.220
BEGAN TO FILL UP.

29:43.091 --> 29:45.922
THIS WAS, LIKE,
THE ACADEMY AWARDS

29:45.956 --> 29:50.098
AND THE GRAMMYS AND
A GREAT PRIZE FIGHT.

29:50.133 --> 29:53.205
ALL THESE THINGS
ROLLED INTO ONE.

29:53.239 --> 29:55.069
PEOPLE WOULD GO HANG OUT

29:55.103 --> 29:57.588
EVEN IF THEY COULDN'T
GET IN TO SEE THE FIGHT,

29:57.623 --> 30:00.488
SO WHAT'S GOING ON
OUTSIDE THE ARENA, I THINK,

30:00.522 --> 30:04.872
IS MAYBE AS INTERESTING AS
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE ARENA,

30:04.906 --> 30:06.874
AND ALI IS THE REASON
FOR ALL THAT.

30:06.908 --> 30:09.186
HE'S THE ONE WHO GENERATES
ALL THIS EXCITEMENT.

30:09.221 --> 30:11.395
ALI'S GONNA WIN.
I FEEL IT.

30:11.430 --> 30:12.949
IT CLEARLY WAS
THE PLACE TO BE.

30:12.983 --> 30:14.640
MUHAMMAD ALI.

30:14.674 --> 30:17.125
WRITER NORMAN MAILER,

30:17.160 --> 30:19.162
BANDLEADER COUNT BASIE,

30:19.196 --> 30:21.371
BROADCASTER ED SULLIVAN,

30:21.405 --> 30:25.340
FILM DIRECTOR WOODY ALLEN
AND ACTOR DIANE KEATON,

30:25.375 --> 30:30.552
SINGERS MARVIN GAYE,
ISAAC HAYES, AND BOB DYLAN,

30:30.587 --> 30:32.969
FORMER CHAMPION JOE LOUIS,

30:33.003 --> 30:35.419
PLAYBOY PUBLISHER
HUGH HEFNER,

30:35.454 --> 30:37.249
AND FRANK SINATRA,

30:37.283 --> 30:40.010
WHO WAS TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS
FOR "LIFE" MAGAZINE,

30:40.045 --> 30:41.943
ALL TURNED OUT.

30:50.676 --> 30:52.540
GWENDOLYN BROOKS,

30:52.574 --> 30:55.508
THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN
TO WIN A PULITZER PRIZE,

30:55.543 --> 30:59.478
WAS ASKED TO WRITE A POEM
FOR THE OFFICIAL PROGRAM.

30:59.512 --> 31:03.068
"LET BLACK LOVE SURVIVE THE
CHALLENGE AND THE BLOOD,"

31:03.102 --> 31:05.139
SHE URGED THE BOXERS.

31:06.623 --> 31:08.245
AT THE WHITE HOUSE,

31:08.280 --> 31:10.558
A CLOSED-CIRCUIT LINE
HAD BEEN INSTALLED

31:10.592 --> 31:13.319
SO THAT PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON
COULD WATCH THE FIGHT.

31:15.356 --> 31:18.290
IN HIS DRESSING ROOM,
ALI REVEALED HIS PREDICTION,

31:18.324 --> 31:21.293
WRITTEN DAYS EARLIER AND
SEALED IN AN ENVELOPE.

31:21.327 --> 31:24.296
"BOXING EXPERTS WILL BE
SHOCKED AT HOW EASY I WILL

31:24.330 --> 31:28.024
BEAT JOE FRAZIER," ALI
ANNOUNCED TO THE TV CAMERAS.

31:28.058 --> 31:30.578
"FRAZIER FALLS IN 6."

31:32.131 --> 31:34.064
MAIN EVENT.

31:34.099 --> 31:40.726
15 ROUNDS FOR THE UNDISPUTED
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

31:40.760 --> 31:42.245
OF THE WORLD.

31:43.522 --> 31:47.388
INTRODUCING, FROM
LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY...

31:47.422 --> 31:50.736
THE CHALLENGER,
IN HIS "ALI SHUFFLE SHOES,"

31:50.770 --> 31:55.051
WHITE WITH RED TASSELS THAT HE
BELIEVED MADE HIM APPEAR FASTER,

31:55.085 --> 31:56.535
ENTERED FIRST.

31:56.569 --> 31:59.365
HERE IS MUHAMMAD ALI!

32:03.128 --> 32:05.130
HIS OPPONENT...

32:05.164 --> 32:08.443
JOE FRAZIER,
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD,

32:08.478 --> 32:11.515
WEARING A GREEN ROBE
WITH HIS NAME AND THOSE

32:11.550 --> 32:14.587
OF HIS 5 CHILDREN
STITCHED IN GOLD ON THE BACK,

32:14.622 --> 32:16.244
CAME NEXT.

32:16.279 --> 32:18.971
...THE HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION OF THE WORLD,

32:19.006 --> 32:20.524
JOE FRAZIER!

32:25.115 --> 32:28.429
INSIDE THE RING,
REFEREE ARTHUR MERCANTE GAVE

32:28.463 --> 32:32.088
THE BOXERS INSTRUCTIONS AS
THEY GLARED AT EACH OTHER.

32:32.122 --> 32:33.641
SHAKE
HANDS NOW, MEN.

32:33.675 --> 32:37.438
"I'M GONNA KILL
YOU," FRAZIER TOLD ALI.

32:44.548 --> 32:47.344
FRAZIER WILL TRY TO
BORE IN AND CATCH HIS MAN.

32:47.379 --> 32:50.106
MUHAMMAD ALI OPENING UP FAST.

32:50.140 --> 32:54.282
FRAZIER JUST FIGHTS ONE WAY.
HE POURS IN AND HE PUNISHES.

32:54.317 --> 32:56.146
JOE WAS A SLUGGER,

32:56.181 --> 32:59.529
WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A GUY
WHO COMES FORWARD LIKE

32:59.563 --> 33:03.498
A SHERMAN TANK ON
FULL ATTACK MODE

33:03.533 --> 33:09.401
AND IS WILLING TO TAKE 2 OR 3
TO LAND 1 OR 2,

33:09.435 --> 33:14.406
WHEREAS MUHAMMAD WAS A GLIDER,
A CRAFTSMAN.

33:14.440 --> 33:18.030
I'M GONNA HIT YOU MORE TIMES
THAN YOU CAN HIT ME,

33:18.065 --> 33:20.136
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN FIND ME.

33:21.654 --> 33:24.623
THOUGH THE
JUDGES SCORED THE FIRST
2 ROUNDS FOR ALI,

33:24.657 --> 33:28.799
HE STRAYED FROM THE STYLE THAT
HAD ONCE SERVED HIM SO WELL.

33:28.834 --> 33:32.148
INSTEAD OF STAYING UP
ON HIS TOES, DANCING,

33:32.182 --> 33:34.598
HE STOOD FLAT-FOOTED
LIKE FRAZIER,

33:34.633 --> 33:37.187
THROWING JABS
AND COMBINATIONS.

33:37.222 --> 33:40.087
HE MAY BE TRYING
TO SLUG WITH JOE.

33:40.121 --> 33:44.367
ALI IS RECOGNIZING
HE'S NOT COMFORTABLE DANCING

33:44.401 --> 33:46.472
LIKE HE DID 5 YEARS AGO.

33:46.507 --> 33:48.198
HE'S NOT
DANCING TONIGHT.

33:48.233 --> 33:49.475
HE'S NOT MOVING
LIKE HE'S IN CONTROL

33:49.510 --> 33:51.098
OF THE RING'S GEOGRAPHY.

33:51.132 --> 33:52.858
FRAZIER HAS
CAUGHT HIM AGAIN!

33:52.892 --> 33:55.654
HE'S MOVING JUST
TO GET AWAY FROM THE STORM

33:55.688 --> 33:58.381
WITHOUT HAVING CONTROL
OF THE STORM,

33:58.415 --> 34:01.556
AND THAT ESSENTIALLY
TRAPS MUHAMMAD

34:01.591 --> 34:04.214
AND JOE TAKES
ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

34:04.249 --> 34:06.596
MUHAMMAD ALI IS
NOT KEEPING JOE FRAZIER

34:06.630 --> 34:08.460
AWAY FROM HIM,

34:08.494 --> 34:11.877
AND HE GETS CAUGHT ON THE
ROPES WHICH HE SHOULD NOT DO.

34:11.911 --> 34:14.500
HE COULDN'T
PLAY WITH JOE FRAZIER.

34:14.535 --> 34:16.571
FRAZIER WOULD HURT HIM.

34:16.606 --> 34:18.539
THERE WAS ONE POINT IN
THAT FIGHT WHERE ALI...

34:18.573 --> 34:20.334
- ALI SHAKES HIS HEAD.
- LEANED IN

34:20.368 --> 34:23.371
AGAINST THE ROPES AND
LOOKED DOWN AT THE PRESS ROW

34:23.406 --> 34:27.341
AND SAID, "NO CONTEST," WHILE
FRAZIER IS BEATING ON HIM,

34:27.375 --> 34:29.619
JUST KIND OF GIVING
AWAY A ROUND.

34:29.653 --> 34:35.107
HE COULD DO THAT WITH LESSER
PEOPLE, BUT NOT WITH FRAZIER.

34:35.142 --> 34:39.353
FRAZIER STAYED LOW,
BOBBING AND DUCKING,

34:39.387 --> 34:42.149
BUT FORCING HIS WAY
FORWARD RELENTLESSLY,

34:42.183 --> 34:44.289
REDUCING THE DISTANCE
BETWEEN THEM,

34:44.323 --> 34:47.223
NEUTRALIZING ALI'S
LONGER REACH.

34:47.257 --> 34:49.328
FRAZIER IS BOBBING
AND WEAVING ALL THE TIME.

34:49.363 --> 34:53.160
FRAZIER'S CONSTANT HEAD
MOVEMENT DOESN'T GIVE MUHAMMAD

34:53.194 --> 34:58.165
AN EASY TARGET, AND THAT'S
EXHAUSTING, PHYSICALLY
AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

34:58.199 --> 34:59.580
MUHAMMAD ALI
HAS BEEN MISSING.

34:59.614 --> 35:01.513
THIS GUY'S
IN FRONT OF YOU

35:01.547 --> 35:03.308
AND HE'S BOBBING
AND WEAVING LIKE THAT,

35:03.342 --> 35:04.757
AND YOU CAN'T HIT HIM.

35:04.792 --> 35:06.690
FRAZIER'S
JUST LAUGHING AT HIM.

35:06.725 --> 35:08.727
- AND HE'S MOCKING YOU?
- TALKING TO HIM.

35:08.761 --> 35:10.522
THAT'S A NIGHTMARE.

35:10.556 --> 35:13.145
HE SAID HE WOULD GO
TO THE BODY AND HE IS.

35:13.180 --> 35:18.633
HIS THEORY WAS TO
STAY CLOSE TO MUHAMMAD,

35:18.668 --> 35:22.361
DON'T LET HIM BREATHE
AND CONSTANTLY PUNCH,

35:22.396 --> 35:24.881
PUNCH HIM EVERYWHERE--

35:24.915 --> 35:26.710
ON THE BICEPS,

35:26.745 --> 35:28.609
ON THE HIP BONE,

35:28.643 --> 35:30.680
ON THE ASS BONE.

35:30.714 --> 35:33.165
OOH, THAT
MUST HAVE HURT.

35:33.200 --> 35:37.273
IF THE REFEREE IS
BEHIND YOU AND HE CAN'T SEE

35:37.307 --> 35:41.415
WHERE THE SHOT IS LANDING,
HIT HIM ON THIS HIP BONE.

35:41.449 --> 35:44.487
IT'S BELOW THE BELT BUT IF
THE REFEREE DON'T SEE IT,

35:44.521 --> 35:47.490
GUESS WHAT.
IT'S NOT A FOUL.

35:47.524 --> 35:49.457
WHAT A ROUND.

35:51.770 --> 35:53.599
TWO UNDEFEATED FIGHTERS.

35:53.634 --> 35:57.741
NEITHER ONE HAS EVER FOUGHT
A FIGHTER OF THE CALIBER

35:57.776 --> 36:00.192
OF THE OPPONENT TONIGHT.

36:00.227 --> 36:03.333
THIS FIGHT SO FAR RANKS
WITH THE GREAT ONES.

36:03.368 --> 36:06.302
BOTH FIGHTERS
CAME OUT HARD IN THE 6th,

36:06.336 --> 36:11.548
ALI INTENDING TO FULFILL HIS
PREDICTION, FRAZIER EAGER TO

36:11.583 --> 36:12.894
MAKE A LIAR OF ALI.

36:17.036 --> 36:20.868
AT THE END OF THE ROUND,
FRAZIER WAS STILL STANDING.

36:22.904 --> 36:27.875
AFTER THE 7th ROUND, THE
FANS CHANTED "ALI, ALI, ALI!"

36:27.909 --> 36:30.533
THE CROWD
IS CHANTING, "ALI!"

36:30.567 --> 36:32.535
AND JOE SAYS,
"COME ON OUT AND FIGHT."

36:36.263 --> 36:40.681
AFTER THE 8th,
IT WAS "JOE, JOE, JOE!"

36:40.715 --> 36:42.959
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE
WHO GETS THE SHEER JOY

36:42.993 --> 36:46.963
OF COMBAT THE WAY
JOE FRAZIER DOES.

36:46.997 --> 36:50.553
ALI COULD STILL MOVE
FOR 2 MINUTES A ROUND,

36:50.587 --> 36:53.383
2.5 MINUTES A ROUND.

36:53.418 --> 36:59.251
HE FOUND WAYS TO REST,
BUT FRAZIER HIT HIM A LOT.

36:59.286 --> 37:02.668
IN SAYING THAT, HE DIDN'T
HIT ALI NEARLY AS MUCH

37:02.703 --> 37:04.636
AS ALI HIT HIM.

37:04.670 --> 37:06.500
FRAZIER HAS TAKEN
A GOOD BATTERING IN THIS ROUND.

37:06.534 --> 37:08.709
BY THE END
OF THAT FIGHT, FRAZIER'S FACE

37:08.743 --> 37:11.505
WAS A GARGOYLE'S FACE,

37:11.539 --> 37:14.680
JUST BUMPS AND
BRUISES EVERYWHERE.

37:14.715 --> 37:17.787
JOE FRAZIER
JUST SPIT SOME BLOOD.

37:17.821 --> 37:20.514
WAVING FRAZIER ON.

37:22.757 --> 37:24.932
THAT ONE HURT.
SO DID THAT.

37:24.966 --> 37:28.453
MUHAMMAD ALI STAGGERS!
MUHAMMAD ALI WAS ROCKED!

37:28.487 --> 37:33.699
THE WILLPOWER OF
THE FIGHTER IS WHAT REALLY

37:33.734 --> 37:35.529
DETERMINES WHO WINS AND LOSES.

37:35.563 --> 37:38.670
30 SECONDS TO
GO IN THE ROUND. 30 SECONDS.

37:38.704 --> 37:40.430
IT'S NEVER CLEARER
THAN THIS FIGHT RIGHT HERE.

37:40.465 --> 37:42.846
MUHAMMAD ALI
IN REAL TROUBLE.

37:42.881 --> 37:44.917
EVERY PUNCH THAT
JOE FRAZIER IS THROWING,

37:44.952 --> 37:47.092
YOU CAN BEST BELIEVE
THAT HE'S SAYING,

37:47.126 --> 37:54.306
"THIS IS FROM AN UNCLE TOM.
AM I AN UNCLE TOM NOW?"

37:54.341 --> 37:56.308
MUHAMMAD ALI
ROCKED TO THE ROPES!

37:56.343 --> 37:57.723
THAT'S THE KIND OF
VENOM YOU HAVE TO HAVE.

37:57.758 --> 37:59.380
HE ALMOST WENT DOWN.

37:59.415 --> 38:01.486
JOE WANTED IT
MORE THAN MUHAMMAD.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.350
MUHAMMAD WANTED IT...

38:03.384 --> 38:04.765
10 SECONDS...

38:04.799 --> 38:07.664
BUT JOE NEEDED IT,

38:07.699 --> 38:09.977
AND MUHAMMAD
IS BEING PUSHED TO THE BRINK.

38:10.011 --> 38:11.530
THE ROUND IS OVER.

38:11.565 --> 38:15.362
THE ROUND IS OVER.
WHAT A ROUND.

38:15.396 --> 38:18.779
MUHAMMAD ALI HAS
NEVER TAKEN SUCH A BATTERING.

38:18.813 --> 38:21.782
IT COULD BE A TOUGH
FIGHT TO SCORE.

38:21.816 --> 38:25.648
AS THE FIGHT HEADED
INTO THE 15th AND FINAL ROUND,

38:25.682 --> 38:30.377
FRAZIER'S FACE WAS SWOLLEN,
HIS RIGHT EYE NEARLY SHUT.

38:30.411 --> 38:34.070
ALI'S CORNER MEN, WORRIED
HE WAS LOSING ON POINTS,

38:34.104 --> 38:37.591
TOLD HIM HE NEEDED
A KNOCKOUT.

38:39.144 --> 38:42.043
15th AND FINAL ROUND.

38:42.078 --> 38:44.908
ALI WAS TOLD
THE END OF THE ROUND,

38:44.943 --> 38:46.565
"YOU GOTTA KNOCK HIM OUT.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.878
YOU CAN'T WIN IF YOU
DON'T KNOCK HIM OUT."

38:48.912 --> 38:50.673
AND IT'S TRUE.

38:50.707 --> 38:52.744
SO ALI'S OUT THERE.

38:52.778 --> 38:56.575
POP, BOOM, POP,
COMBINATIONS, THIS, THAT.

38:58.025 --> 39:00.648
AND FRAZIER DUCKS INSIDE.

39:00.683 --> 39:04.445
BOOM, LEFT HOOK, DOWN,

39:04.480 --> 39:07.586
GETS UP QUICK, BUT
THAT ENDED ANY CHANCE

39:07.621 --> 39:08.967
HE HAD TO WIN THE FIGHT.

39:11.107 --> 39:13.558
HE TAKES THE
MANDATORY 8 COUNT.

39:13.592 --> 39:16.837
THE ONLY KNOCKDOWN
OF THE FIGHT.

39:16.871 --> 39:19.426
MUHAMMAD ALI
WAS FLAT ON HIS BACK,

39:19.460 --> 39:22.014
BUT HE'S A WELL-CONDITIONED
ATHLETE.

39:22.049 --> 39:25.397
MUHAMMAD ALI
GAMELY FIGHTS BACK.

39:25.432 --> 39:27.744
THE CROWD IS IN A BEDLAM.

39:35.752 --> 39:40.516
WE'RE GOING TO AWAIT THE
DECISION BY THE TWO JUDGES

39:40.550 --> 39:42.034
AND THE REFEREE.

39:42.069 --> 39:44.830
AND THE RING IS
STARTING TO CROWD UP.

39:44.865 --> 39:48.420
DESPITE THE SECURITY
MEASURES TAKEN, THE PEOPLE ARE

39:48.455 --> 39:52.666
COMING IN THE RING, AND THIS
WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

39:52.700 --> 39:58.603
AH, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
REFEREE ARTHUR MERCANTE

39:58.637 --> 40:03.849
SCORES IT 8-6,
ONE EVEN FOR FRAZIER.

40:06.680 --> 40:10.960
ARTIE AIDALA 9 TO 6
FOR FRAZIER.

40:13.238 --> 40:18.174
BILL RECHT 11 ROUNDS
FOR FRAZIER,

40:18.208 --> 40:22.074
4 ALI, 11 AND 4,

40:22.109 --> 40:26.700
THE WINNER BY UNANIMOUS
DECISION AND STILL...

40:26.734 --> 40:31.463
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD, JOE FRAZIER!

40:40.645 --> 40:45.028
IT WAS MUHAMMAD
ALI'S FIRST PROFESSIONAL LOSS.

40:45.063 --> 40:49.136
HE RETURNED TO HIS
DRESSING ROOM, HIS JAW
GROTESQUELY SWOLLEN,

40:49.170 --> 40:52.829
WHERE HIS MOTHER, ODESSA,
HELD HIM, MURMURING,

40:52.864 --> 40:54.624
"HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT."

40:54.659 --> 40:57.903
THE SINGER DIANA ROSS CAME
TO CHECK ON HER FRIEND.

40:57.938 --> 41:03.771
SO DID THE PHOTOGRAPHER GORDON
PARKS, WHO TOOK NO PICTURES.

41:03.806 --> 41:08.189
CONCERNED THAT ALI'S JAW WAS
BROKEN, FERDIE PACHECO SENT HIM

41:08.224 --> 41:11.503
TO FLOWER 5th AVENUE HOSPITAL
FOR X-RAYS.

41:11.538 --> 41:14.920
THERE WAS NO FRACTURE,
BUT DOCTORS STILL WANTED HIM

41:14.955 --> 41:17.164
TO REMAIN THERE OVERNIGHT.

41:17.198 --> 41:21.755
ALI REFUSED, UNWILLING TO GIVE
JOE FRAZIER THE SATISFACTION

41:21.789 --> 41:24.516
OF HAVING PUT HIM
IN THE HOSPITAL.

41:24.551 --> 41:26.207
WHAT DID MUHAMMAD
ALI SAY WHEN YOU GOT TO

41:26.242 --> 41:28.175
THE DRESSING ROOM?

41:28.209 --> 41:31.523
HE JUST WANT TO KNOW
DID HE PUT UP A GREAT FIGHT.

41:31.558 --> 41:33.974
BUNDINI BROWN
APPEARED AT THE POST-FIGHT

41:34.008 --> 41:36.563
PRESS CONFERENCE
IN ALI'S PLACE.

41:36.597 --> 41:38.772
"WE AIN'T THROUGH YET,"
HE SAID.

41:38.806 --> 41:42.741
"MUHAMMAD JUST
BEEN OUT 3 YEARS."

41:42.776 --> 41:47.884
WE SEE HIS DECLINE WHEN
HE FIGHTS JOE FRAZIER 'CAUSE

41:47.919 --> 41:52.130
HIS LEGS WHICH WERE HIS
PRIMARY INSTRUMENTS,

41:52.164 --> 41:53.925
THEY WERE NO MORE.

41:53.959 --> 41:56.203
THEY WERE DEAD.

41:56.237 --> 41:59.171
"TONIGHT THE BLACK
WORLD WEEPS THAT THEIR KING

41:59.206 --> 42:03.590
HAS PASSED AWAY," LAMENTED A
BLACK NATIONALIST FROM BRITAIN.

42:03.624 --> 42:06.765
PRESIDENT MUAMMAR EL-QADDAFI
OF LIBYA

42:06.800 --> 42:08.836
DECLARED A DAY OF MOURNING.

42:08.871 --> 42:12.702
IT WAS "A VERY PAINFUL
EXPERIENCE IN EVERY WAY,"

42:12.737 --> 42:14.601
WROTE HUNTER S. THOMPSON,

42:14.635 --> 42:19.916
WHO CALLED ALI'S DEFEAT
"A PROPER END TO THE SIXTIES."

42:19.951 --> 42:23.886
THOUGH ALI FANS
AROUND THE WORLD DESPAIRED,

42:23.920 --> 42:28.580
MOST AGREED THAT THE BOUT HAD
LIVED UP TO ITS IMMENSE HYPE.

42:28.615 --> 42:31.100
"THE MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR
FIGHT...WAS WORTH EVERY

42:31.134 --> 42:34.586
GLORIOUS, HEARTBREAKING
PENNY," WROTE ARTHUR DALEY

42:34.621 --> 42:37.209
IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES."

42:37.244 --> 42:42.249
MORE THAN 5,000 PEOPLE HAD
BRAVED 18-DEGREE TEMPERATURES

42:42.283 --> 42:44.838
TO ATTEND A
CLOSED-CIRCUIT BROADCAST

42:44.872 --> 42:47.806
AT PITTSBURGH'S OPEN-AIR
THREE RIVERS STADIUM.

42:47.841 --> 42:49.739
OH, THERE HE GOES!

42:49.774 --> 42:52.328
LONDONERS HAD STAYED UP ALL
NIGHT FOR A BROADCAST THAT

42:52.362 --> 42:55.987
BEGAN JUST BEFORE 5 A.M.

42:56.021 --> 42:58.645
AND IN VIETNAM,
AMERICAN TROOPS

42:58.679 --> 43:01.199
HAD LISTENED IN ON
THEIR TRANSISTOR RADIOS.

43:01.233 --> 43:05.203
JOE FRAZIER OUT-
POINTED MUHAMMAD ALI TONIGHT

43:05.237 --> 43:09.276
AND RETAINED THE HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE WORLD.

43:11.036 --> 43:13.211
ALI, HOW DOES
IT FEEL TO HAVE

43:13.245 --> 43:16.145
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL
CAREER, HAVE LOST?

43:16.179 --> 43:18.009
I FEEL YOU HAVE
OBLIGATION TO MANY

43:18.043 --> 43:20.736
THOUSANDS OF FANS WHO ARE
PULLING FOR YOU, WHO ARE CRYING

43:20.770 --> 43:23.014
AND THEY'RE WORRYING
ABOUT YOU AND HOW YOU FEEL.

43:23.048 --> 43:26.396
AND I THINK IF THEY CAN SEE
THAT YOU REALIZE THAT

43:26.431 --> 43:30.021
I'M HUMAN AND I REALIZE
THAT WE ALL HAVE TO LOSE

43:30.055 --> 43:32.748
AND LIFE STILL GOING ON,
THEN THEY'LL FEEL STRONGER.

43:32.782 --> 43:35.958
I THINK A CELEBRITY OR ANY
SO-CALLED GREAT PERSON

43:35.992 --> 43:39.996
HAVE OBLIGATION TO FULFILL TO
TAKE DEFEAT LIKE A MAN SO THEY

43:40.031 --> 43:42.102
CAN TAKE THEIR DEFEATS
WHEN THEY HAVE THEM.

43:42.136 --> 43:44.276
BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GONNA
HAVE VARIOUS DEFEATS IN LIFE,

43:44.311 --> 43:47.038
WHETHER WE LOST OUR LOVED
ONES OR WEALTH OR TITLES.

43:47.072 --> 43:49.696
AND MANY PEOPLE JUST CAN'T
STAND THESE PRESSURES AND THEY

43:49.730 --> 43:51.318
CRACK UP ON THEM.

43:51.352 --> 43:53.941
AND WHEN A MAN CAN COME
THROUGH THIS AFTER SO MANY

43:53.976 --> 43:56.910
YEARS OF VICTORY AND BEING SO
SUPREME IN HIS FIELD AND ABLE

43:56.944 --> 43:59.947
TO HANDLE THE DEFEAT ALSO
VICTORIOUS, AND THIS MAKE HIM

43:59.982 --> 44:01.708
A BIGGER MAN.DO YOU--

44:01.742 --> 44:03.882
I JUST LOST A FIGHT,
THAT'S ALL.

44:06.885 --> 44:09.405
THE NEXT DAY, ALI
LOOKED LIKE HE HAD BEEN

44:09.439 --> 44:11.234
IN A FIGHT.

44:11.269 --> 44:15.307
I'D NEVER SEEN HIM
BEFORE LOOKING LIKE THAT.

44:19.311 --> 44:24.869
JOE FRAZIER
JUSTIFIABLY GOT THE DECISION,

44:24.903 --> 44:31.738
BUT I THINK IN A SENSE
ALI WON AMERICA.

44:31.772 --> 44:35.742
AND THE REASON HE WON
AMERICA WAS THAT

44:35.776 --> 44:42.852
IT WAS NOW VERY CLEAR
HOW MUCH HE HAD SACRIFICED.

44:42.887 --> 44:44.785
I THINK LOSING TO JOE
FRAZIER IS ONE OF THE MOST

44:44.820 --> 44:47.408
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT
EVER HAPPENED TO ALI.

44:47.443 --> 44:49.410
BECAUSE HE'S HUMAN NOW.

44:49.445 --> 44:53.138
PEOPLE HATED HIM
WHEN HE REFUSED TO
FIGHT FOR HIS COUNTRY.

44:53.173 --> 44:56.003
THEY HATED HIM WHEN
HE CHANGED HIS NAME.

44:56.038 --> 44:58.419
BUT NOW THEY SEE HIM
LYING ON HIS BACK.

44:58.454 --> 45:00.456
AND AS SOON AS HE GETS
KNOCKED DOWN BY FRAZIER,

45:00.490 --> 45:03.355
HE'S UP ON HIS FEET AGAIN.

45:03.390 --> 45:07.739
AND HE CONTINUES AND HE LASTS
THROUGH THE REST OF THE FIGHT

45:07.774 --> 45:10.811
AND THEN THE DECISION
IS FOR FRAZIER.

45:10.846 --> 45:15.022
SO ALI IS A LOSER,
BUT HE'S HUMAN NOW.

45:15.057 --> 45:16.921
AND HE'S TRYING TO FIGHT
HIS WAY BACK TO ANOTHER SHOT

45:16.955 --> 45:18.854
AT THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

45:18.888 --> 45:23.306
AND THIS IS WHEN ALI REALLY
BECOMES POPULAR IN AMERICA.

45:23.341 --> 45:26.516
AND NOW YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE
KIDS LIKE ME PUT HIS POSTER

45:26.551 --> 45:27.794
ON THE WALL.

45:29.416 --> 45:32.212
JOE FRAZIER
STRUGGLED TO RECOVER FROM

45:32.246 --> 45:34.835
THE BRUTAL POUNDING
HE HAD RECEIVED.

45:34.870 --> 45:38.908
HE WAS UNABLE TO WALK
OR EVEN STAND UP.

45:38.943 --> 45:43.395
THE NEXT DAY, HIS EYES REMAINED
SWOLLEN AND SENSITIVE TO LIGHT,

45:43.430 --> 45:45.363
AND HE COULDN'T URINATE.

45:45.397 --> 45:48.780
HE FAILED TO SHOW UP AT A
TELEVISION STUDIO WHERE HE

45:48.815 --> 45:52.819
AND ALI WERE SCHEDULED
TO DISCUSS THEIR BOUT
WITH HOWARD COSELL,

45:52.853 --> 45:55.545
CLAIMING HE WAS
STRICKEN WITH THE FLU.

45:55.580 --> 45:57.478
A WEEK AFTER THE FIGHT,

45:57.513 --> 45:59.929
HE CHECKED INTO
A PHILADELPHIA HOSPITAL,

45:59.964 --> 46:02.380
WHERE DOCTORS PUT
HIM ON A RESTRICTED DIET

46:02.414 --> 46:06.039
AND TREATED HIM FOR HIGH
BLOOD PRESSURE AND EXHAUSTION.

46:06.073 --> 46:09.939
A RUMOR CIRCULATED THAT
HE WAS NEAR DEATH.

46:09.974 --> 46:14.323
10 DAYS LATER, FRAZIER
FINALLY RETURNED HOME.

46:14.357 --> 46:17.222
I GO DOWN TO
PHILADELPHIA TO JOE'S GYM.

46:17.257 --> 46:19.535
WE'RE STANDING
ON THE SIDEWALK.

46:19.569 --> 46:22.365
3 KIDS COME RUNNING
DOWN THE STREET, LITTLE KIDS,

46:22.400 --> 46:26.922
8 YEARS OLD, BLACK KIDS.
"JOE FRAZIER, JOE FRAZIER!"

46:26.956 --> 46:28.993
HE SAYS TO A GOPHER, "GO GET
THE PICTURES OUT OF THE CAR,"

46:29.027 --> 46:30.926
YOU KNOW,
PATS 'EM ON THE HEAD.

46:30.960 --> 46:33.100
ALL OF A SUDDEN, ONE KID LOOKS
UP AND SAYS, "MY DADDY SAYS

46:33.135 --> 46:35.068
MUHAMMAD ALI WAS DRUGGED."

46:35.102 --> 46:37.035
FRAZIER LEANS IN.

46:37.070 --> 46:39.037
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA
PUSH HIM OR SOMETHING.

46:39.072 --> 46:42.938
AND THEN HE SAID, "YOU GO HOME
AND TELL YOUR DADDY HE'S RIGHT.

46:42.972 --> 46:45.250
"HE WAS DRUGGED.
I DRUG HIM WITH A LEFT HOOK.

46:45.285 --> 46:46.976
NOW GET OUTTA HERE."

46:48.529 --> 46:51.498
ALI RETURNED TO
THE SPANISH-STYLE RANCH HOUSE

46:51.532 --> 46:54.950
ON 4 ACRES HE AND BELINDA
HAD RECENTLY PURCHASED

46:54.984 --> 46:58.539
IN CHERRY HILL, NEW JERSEY,
JUST ACROSS THE DELAWARE RIVER

46:58.574 --> 47:00.334
FROM PHILADELPHIA.

47:00.369 --> 47:03.441
HE HELPED BELINDA CHOOSE
FURNISHINGS, KEPT UP

47:03.475 --> 47:06.513
WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS BY
TELEPHONE, AND OCCASIONALLY

47:06.547 --> 47:10.448
ENTERTAINED HIS 3 CHILDREN--
MARYUM AND THE TWINS

47:10.482 --> 47:13.037
JAMILLAH AND RASHEDA.

47:13.071 --> 47:17.006
BUT HE WAS
HAPPIEST ON THE ROAD.

47:17.041 --> 47:19.181
I'M NEVER HOME MUCH,
AND THEY DON'T KNOW ME.

47:19.215 --> 47:21.114
MY MARYUM, THE OLDER ONE,
KNOW ME,

47:21.148 --> 47:23.288
BUT RASHEDA AND JAMILLAH--
THEY DON'T KNOW ME TOO WELL.

47:23.323 --> 47:25.981
THEY ABOUT A YEAR OLD AND
THEY GIVE ME A LOT OF TROUBLE,

47:26.015 --> 47:28.259
AND I PICK THEM UP, BUT I HAVE
TO START STAYING HOME MORE.

47:28.293 --> 47:31.607
BUT I THINK THAT THE WIFE OR
THE MOTHER SHOULD TRAIN 'EM,

47:31.641 --> 47:34.541
AND BY THE TIME THEY'RE 3
YEARS OLD, THEY SHOULD BE READY

47:34.575 --> 47:37.578
TO GO TO SOME TYPE SCHOOL
WITH ENOUGH HOME TRAINING TO

47:37.613 --> 47:39.546
GIVE THEM A GOOD START.

47:39.580 --> 47:42.066
HE LIKES KIDS,
HE LIKES TO BE AROUND THEM

47:42.100 --> 47:43.930
FOR 20 MINUTES AND THEN
HE READY TO PUT 'EM DOWN.

47:43.964 --> 47:47.278
BUT UH, HE CAN'T, YOU KNOW,
HE DON'T STAY THAT LONG.

47:47.312 --> 47:49.625
HE JUST--HE JUST FOR
THE MOMENT AND HE'S DONE.

47:49.659 --> 47:51.316
BUT HE WAS A GREAT FATHER.

47:51.351 --> 47:54.181
HE MADE SURE EVERYBODY
HAD WHAT THEY NEEDED,

47:54.216 --> 47:56.701
AND HE WAS A GREAT FATHER
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT.

47:56.735 --> 48:00.187
DO YOU KNOW YOUR DADDY'S
THE BADDEST MAN IN THE WORLD?

48:00.222 --> 48:04.157
DO YOU KNOW YOUR DADDY
CAN WHOOP ALL THE MEN
IN THE WHOLE WORLD

48:04.191 --> 48:06.297
AND YOU DON'T CARE?

48:06.331 --> 48:09.196
REPORTERS TURNED
UP AT THE HOUSE EAGER TO KNOW

48:09.231 --> 48:12.061
WHEN THE BOXER WOULD
FIGHT FRAZIER AGAIN.

48:12.096 --> 48:14.684
"HE'S RESTING.
I'M RESTING.

48:14.719 --> 48:17.618
THE PUBLIC NEEDS A REST,
TOO," ALI SAID.

48:17.653 --> 48:22.175
HE ALSO CLAIMED THAT A REMATCH
WOULD BE HIS FINAL FIGHT

48:22.209 --> 48:24.694
BEFORE HE QUIT BOXING
TO FOCUS FULL-TIME

48:24.729 --> 48:28.146
ON SPREADING THE TEACHINGS
OF ELIJAH MUHAMMAD.

48:28.181 --> 48:30.321
IT HAD BEEN NEARLY TWO YEARS

48:30.355 --> 48:33.496
SINCE THE NATION OF ISLAM'S
LEADER HAD SUSPENDED ALI

48:33.531 --> 48:36.258
AND REVOKED HIS MUSLIM NAME.

48:36.292 --> 48:39.606
"IF BOXING'S IN YOUR BLOOD,"
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD HAD TOLD HIM,

48:39.640 --> 48:41.539
"GET IT OUT."

48:41.573 --> 48:45.094
"I CAN'T REPRESENT THE MUSLIMS
AGAIN UNTIL I QUIT SPORTS,"

48:45.129 --> 48:47.165
ALI SAID.

48:47.200 --> 48:50.720
BUT HE HAD CONTINUED
TO USE HIS MUSLIM NAME

48:50.755 --> 48:54.517
AND CONTINUED TO ASSOCIATE WITH
MEMBERS OF THE NATION OF ISLAM,

48:54.552 --> 48:58.211
NOW PLAGUED BY INCREASING
VIOLENCE AND CORRUPTION

48:58.245 --> 49:01.041
AS SOME LIEUTENANTS
POSITIONED THEMSELVES

49:01.076 --> 49:03.768
TO SUCCEED
THEIR AGING LEADER.

49:03.802 --> 49:07.323
AND IN SPITE OF ALI'S
BANISHMENT, HERBERT MUHAMMAD,

49:07.358 --> 49:10.257
ELIJAH'S SON, REMAINED
THE BOXER'S MANAGER,

49:10.292 --> 49:13.502
POCKETING 1/3 OF ALI'S
BOXING INCOME, AS WELL AS

49:13.536 --> 49:16.539
A PERCENTAGE OF THE CLOSED-
CIRCUIT TELEVISION PROFITS

49:16.574 --> 49:18.645
FROM EACH BOUT.

49:18.679 --> 49:22.511
IN THE DECADE SINCE HE HAD
TURNED PROFESSIONAL, ALI HAD

49:22.545 --> 49:26.101
BURNED THROUGH MUCH OF HIS
$7 MILLION IN EARNINGS,

49:26.135 --> 49:29.690
CARING FOR HIS FAMILY AND
HIS ENTOURAGE, MAINTAINING

49:29.725 --> 49:32.590
MULTIPLE HOUSES AND A FLEET
OF CARS THAT INCLUDED

49:32.624 --> 49:37.595
TWO ROLLS-ROYCES, A COLLECTION
OF CADILLACS, AND A BUS.

49:37.629 --> 49:40.770
HE ALSO GAVE
PLENTY OF IT AWAY.

49:40.805 --> 49:44.774
THERE WAS A GUY CAME INTO
THE GYM IN A WHEELCHAIR
AND A DODGERS HAT

49:44.809 --> 49:46.673
AND HE HAD NO LEGS.

49:46.707 --> 49:49.055
AND ANGELO WENT OVER TO ALI
AND SAID, "ALI THAT GUY'S

49:49.089 --> 49:50.401
"GONNA TELL YOU HE'S ROY
CAMPANELLA AND HE'S GONNA HIT

49:50.435 --> 49:52.368
"YOU UP FOR MONEY,
HE'S A HUSTLER.

49:52.403 --> 49:55.544
HE COMES IN HERE ALL THE TIME.
DON'T GIVE HIM ANY MONEY."

49:55.578 --> 49:57.580
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
DUNDEE LOOKS OVER AND HE SEES

49:57.615 --> 50:00.031
ALI REACHING INTO HIS POCKET,
TAKING OUT A BIG WAD OF CASH

50:00.066 --> 50:01.688
AND HANDING IT TO THE GUY.

50:01.722 --> 50:03.828
AND ANGELO COMES OVER
AFTERWARDS AND SAYS,

50:03.862 --> 50:06.072
"WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?
I TOLD YOU HE'S A HUSTLER."

50:06.106 --> 50:10.559
AND ALI SAYS,
"ANG, WE GOT LEGS."

50:10.593 --> 50:14.632
HERE COME THIS DRUNK,
JUST SHAKING, AND HE SAY,

50:14.666 --> 50:18.808
"MR. ALI, CAN I GET SOME MONEY
TO GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT?"

50:18.843 --> 50:22.398
AND ALI HAD JUST BOUGHT
A CASHMERE OVERCOAT.

50:22.433 --> 50:25.781
HE TOOK THAT COAT OFF AND
WRAPPED IT IN HIM AND TOLD ME,

50:25.815 --> 50:27.852
"GIVE HIM $10,"
AND I GAVE HIM $10.

50:43.902 --> 50:49.253
IN ALI'S PRESENCE,
YOU ALWAYS FELT THAT HE CARED.

50:49.287 --> 50:51.531
THAT MOMENT THAT HE WAS WITH
YOU, THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE

50:51.565 --> 50:53.360
IN THE WORLD.

50:53.395 --> 50:57.744
I'M NOT SO SURE THAT
THAT'S TRUE OF A LOT OF PEOPLE.

50:57.778 --> 51:02.749
WE SAW AT A YOUNG
AGE THAT DADDY, EVERY TIME HE

51:02.783 --> 51:06.235
WOKE UP IN THE MORNING,
I THINK HE REALLY FELT LIKE,

51:06.270 --> 51:08.789
"HOW AM I GOING TO
HELP SOMEBODY TODAY?"

51:08.824 --> 51:12.207
AND HE DID THAT ALL THE TIME.

51:12.241 --> 51:15.141
HE WOULD HAVE ROLEX WATCHES
AND HE WOULD JUST TAKE IT OFF

51:15.175 --> 51:16.280
AND GIVE IT TO PEOPLE.

51:16.314 --> 51:18.213
HE'D HAVE MONEY IN HIS PO--

51:18.247 --> 51:21.112
AND WE'D BE LIKE, "DADDY
DON'T DO THAT, YOU CAN'T."

51:21.147 --> 51:22.458
HE'D HAVE MONEY IN HIS POCKET,

51:22.493 --> 51:24.391
AND HE'D JUST HAND
IT TO PEOPLE.

51:24.426 --> 51:27.705
ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS ASK,
AND HE WOULD GIVE THEM

51:27.739 --> 51:30.156
WHATEVER THEY WANTED,

51:30.190 --> 51:34.125
BECAUSE DADDY'S PURPOSE WAS
JUST TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SPECIAL

51:34.160 --> 51:35.816
AND HELP PEOPLE.

51:35.851 --> 51:39.268
ALI COULD HAVE $30,000 IN HIS
POCKET ONE AFTERNOON,

51:39.303 --> 51:41.443
HE COME BACK,
HE HAVE NOTHIN'.

51:41.477 --> 51:45.619
SOMEBODY GIVE HIM A SAD STORY,
HE WOULD FALL IN AND TAKE CARE

51:45.654 --> 51:47.414
OF THEIR KID AND TAKE
CARE OF THEIR HOUSE,

51:47.449 --> 51:49.485
THEY LOSIN' THEY HOUSE.

51:49.520 --> 51:51.246
HE JUST LOVE TO GIVE.

51:51.280 --> 51:53.731
IF SOMEBODY'S HURTING,
HE LOVED TO HELP THE PAIN.

51:53.765 --> 51:56.389
I THINK--
I THINK HE'LL GO TO PARADISE

51:56.423 --> 51:58.839
BECAUSE OF THAT, 'CAUSE
HE DID GIVE A LOT OF CHARITY!

52:03.637 --> 52:05.398
HOW DO YOU STAND
NOW WITH THE POSSIBILITY

52:05.432 --> 52:06.847
OF GOING TO JAIL?

52:06.882 --> 52:08.228
OH,
I DON'T KNOW.

52:08.263 --> 52:09.540
I'M JUST WAITING,
ANY DAY NOW.

52:09.574 --> 52:12.370
DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT?

52:12.405 --> 52:14.786
WHENEVER PEOPLE WANT
TO REALLY MAKE PROGRESS,

52:14.821 --> 52:17.168
SOME HAVE TO SACRIFICE A LOT.

52:17.203 --> 52:21.759
AND I LIKE TO SAY, UM...
WHITE AMERICA RIGHT NOW IS

52:21.793 --> 52:23.795
SPENDING $30 MILLION
A DAY IN ASIA,

52:23.830 --> 52:26.212
BLACK AND WHITE BOYS ARE
DYING UNJUSTLY FOR NOTHING.

52:26.246 --> 52:28.800
SO WHY SHOULD I WORRY ABOUT
GOING TO LITTLE OLD JAIL

52:28.835 --> 52:32.321
TO FREE MY POOR PEOPLE
WHO'S BEEN CATCHING HELL
HERE FOR 400 YEARS?

52:35.842 --> 52:40.467
ON APRIL 19, 1971,
CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE,

52:40.502 --> 52:43.539
A LAWYER WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY
REPRESENTED MARTIN LUTHER KING,

52:43.574 --> 52:46.577
APPEARED BEFORE THE
SUPREME COURT ON BEHALF

52:46.611 --> 52:50.477
OF MUHAMMAD ALI, ARGUING THAT
HIS CONVICTION FOR REFUSING

52:50.512 --> 52:53.825
THE DRAFT SHOULD
BE OVERTURNED.

52:53.860 --> 52:58.623
THE JUSTICES HAD NOT INITIALLY
PLANNED TO HEAR THE CASE.

52:58.658 --> 53:01.592
THEY WERE AGAIN
PREDISPOSED TO JUST DENY IT

53:01.626 --> 53:04.733
BECAUSE THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO
BE ANY BIG LEGAL ISSUE HERE,

53:04.767 --> 53:07.908
BUT JUSTICE BRENNAN MADE AN
IMPASSIONED PLEA THAT THEY

53:07.943 --> 53:11.636
SHOULD AT LEAST HEAR THE CASE,
BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

53:11.671 --> 53:15.778
WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY
SOMEBODY WHO WAS ADVANCING

53:15.813 --> 53:19.575
A CLAIM LIKE THIS, WHO HAD
THE STATURE AND IMPORTANCE

53:19.610 --> 53:23.441
OF MUHAMMAD ALI,
HADN'T HAD A DAY IN COURT.

53:23.476 --> 53:26.755
AND SO THE COURT AGREED TO
HEAR THE CASE, FULLY EXPECTING

53:26.789 --> 53:30.345
THAT THEY WERE PROBABLY GOING
TO AFFIRM THE CONVICTION.

53:30.379 --> 53:32.588
"THE PETITIONER
JUST DOESN'T WANT TO FIGHT

53:32.623 --> 53:35.798
THE WHITE MAN'S WAR,
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT,"

53:35.833 --> 53:39.871
SOLICITOR GENERAL ERWIN GRISWOLD
TOLD THE SUPREME COURT ON BEHALF

53:39.906 --> 53:41.597
OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

53:41.632 --> 53:45.429
"BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME
AS BEING A PACIFIST."

53:46.844 --> 53:51.262
ALI'S OPPOSITION TO FIGHTING,
ARGUED HIS LAWYER, WASN'T

53:51.297 --> 53:54.714
RACIAL OR POLITICAL,
BUT ROOTED IN SINCERE

53:54.748 --> 53:57.924
RELIGIOUS BELIEF.

53:57.958 --> 54:01.341
THURGOOD MARSHALL
CANNOT VOTE BECAUSE HE HAD

54:01.376 --> 54:03.930
WORKED FOR THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT WHEN ALI

54:03.964 --> 54:05.897
WAS FIRST CHARGED.

54:05.932 --> 54:08.935
SO HE'S GOTTA RECUSE HIMSELF.

54:08.969 --> 54:11.317
SO NOW WE HAVE AN
8-JUDGE COURT.

54:12.525 --> 54:14.596
THEY SIT DOWN
AND HAVE THEIR CONFERENCE.

54:14.630 --> 54:17.461
THEY VOTE 5-3,
HE GOES TO JAIL.

54:18.841 --> 54:21.534
DURING THE
PERIOD WHILE THE ALI CASE WAS

54:21.568 --> 54:25.400
UP AT THE SUPREME COURT THE
SECOND TIME, I WAS A LAW CLERK

54:25.434 --> 54:27.988
TO ONE OF THE JUSTICES,
TO JUSTICE HARLAN.

54:28.023 --> 54:31.682
THE CHIEF JUSTICE CHOSE JUSTICE
HARLAN TO WRITE THE OPINION,

54:31.716 --> 54:34.581
AND THEY ALL EXPECTED HE WAS
GOING TO WRITE AN OPINION

54:34.616 --> 54:36.583
TO AFFIRM THE CONVICTION.

54:36.618 --> 54:39.103
TOM KRATTENMAKER
HAD BEEN READING ABOUT

54:39.137 --> 54:40.967
THE NATION OF ISLAM

54:41.001 --> 54:43.901
AND BELIEVED THAT ALI'S CLAIM
OF RELIGIOUS OPPOSITION

54:43.935 --> 54:46.835
TO FIGHTING IN WARS WAS
NO DIFFERENT THAN THE ARGUMENT

54:46.869 --> 54:49.596
JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES
HAD SUCCESSFULLY PRESENTED TO

54:49.631 --> 54:52.599
THE COURT IN THE 1950s.

54:52.634 --> 54:54.981
THE LAW CLERK
OF JUSTICE HARLAN GOES IN

54:55.015 --> 54:58.329
AND SAYS, "LISTEN, WITH ALL
DUE RESPECT MR. JUSTICE,

54:58.364 --> 54:59.848
"I'VE GOT SOME STUFF HERE
ABOUT THE NATION OF ISLAM

54:59.882 --> 55:01.401
AND WHAT IT BELIEVES."

55:01.436 --> 55:03.403
I THOUGHT
ONCE HE GOT DEEPER INTO

55:03.438 --> 55:07.580
THE DOCUMENTS AND INTO
THE UNDERLYING MATERIALS

55:07.614 --> 55:10.686
IN THE CASE, HE WOULD FIND
THAT ALI DID IN FACT HAVE

55:10.721 --> 55:14.103
A SINCERE OBJECTION
TO FIGHTING ALL WARS.

55:14.138 --> 55:18.625
WHAT ALI SAID IS, I AM A
MEMBER OF THE LOST-FOUND

55:18.660 --> 55:20.144
NATION OF ISLAM.

55:20.178 --> 55:22.767
IT IS PART OF OUR
RELIGIOUS TENET THAT WE

55:22.802 --> 55:26.461
WILL NOT FIGHT ANY WARS IN
WHICH HUMAN LIFE IS BEING TAKEN,

55:26.495 --> 55:29.740
UNLESS I'M
COMMANDED TO FIGHT BY ALLAH.

55:29.774 --> 55:35.849
AND, THOSE VIEWS ARE,
A RELIGIOUSLY BASED OBJECTION

55:35.884 --> 55:40.129
TO PARTICIPATION IN
WAR IN ALL FORMS.

55:40.164 --> 55:44.720
AND ONE DAY, JUSTICE HARLAN
WALKED IN AND SAID,

55:44.755 --> 55:49.829
"YOU KNOW, I'VE DECIDED
YOU GUYS ARE RIGHT."

55:49.863 --> 55:53.557
IT'S PRETTY UNUSUAL FOR
JUSTICES TO CHANGE THEIR MIND.

55:53.591 --> 55:56.180
IN THIS CASE, IT WAS
QUITE A BOMBSHELL.

55:56.214 --> 55:58.147
NO ONE EXPECTED IT.

55:58.182 --> 56:00.011
EVERYONE ON THE COURT
THOUGHT THIS CONVICTION

56:00.046 --> 56:02.013
WAS GOING TO BE AFFIRMED.

56:02.048 --> 56:04.844
CHIEF JUSTICE
WARREN BURGER WAS LIVID,

56:04.878 --> 56:10.401
CALLING HARLAN "AN APOLOGIST
FOR THE BLACK MUSLIMS."

56:10.436 --> 56:14.888
THE VOTE, NOW SPLIT 4-4,
MEANT THAT ALI'S CONVICTION

56:14.923 --> 56:20.549
WOULD BE UPHELD,
BUT THE JUSTICES WOULD
PUBLISH NO OPINION.

56:20.584 --> 56:24.691
IT WOULD BE AS IF THEY HAD
NEVER EVEN TAKEN THE CASE.

56:26.900 --> 56:31.042
THEN, ANOTHER JUSTICE,
POTTER STEWART, DISCOVERED

56:31.077 --> 56:34.805
A PROCEDURAL ERROR BY THE
KENTUCKY APPEALS BOARD THAT HE

56:34.839 --> 56:38.705
BELIEVED THE COURT COULD USE
TO OVERTURN ALI'S CONVICTION

56:38.740 --> 56:40.845
WITHOUT SETTING A PRECEDENT.

56:40.880 --> 56:45.609
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STATE
APPEAL BOARD USED

56:45.643 --> 56:50.441
AS A REASON FOR DENYING ALI
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR STATUS,

56:50.476 --> 56:52.443
BECAUSE THEY
GAVE NO REASONS.

56:52.478 --> 56:54.825
THEY JUST TURNED HIM DOWN.

56:54.859 --> 56:58.691
AND SO THAT DENIED DUE PROCESS
OF LAW TO THIS ONE PERSON,

56:58.725 --> 57:00.555
MUHAMMAD ALI.

57:00.589 --> 57:04.628
ONCE JUSTICE STEWART LATCHED
ON TO THIS PROCEDURAL POINT,

57:04.662 --> 57:07.078
HE AND HIS LAW
CLERKS DRAFTED IT UP

57:07.113 --> 57:08.804
AND SENT IT AROUND,

57:08.839 --> 57:11.945
AND ONE BY ONE, JUSTICES
STARTED JOINING IT.

57:11.980 --> 57:14.983
THE FINAL PERSON TO JOIN
WAS THE CHIEF JUSTICE.

57:15.017 --> 57:19.677
AND SO, BY THE END, IT
WAS UNANIMOUS TO REVERSE

57:19.712 --> 57:21.230
ALI'S CONVICTION.
HA HA!

57:21.265 --> 57:23.923
THE COURT
UNANIMOUSLY THREW OUT

57:23.957 --> 57:27.064
THE CONVICTION OF BOXER
MUHAMMAD ALI, OR CASSIUS CLAY...

57:27.098 --> 57:32.207
ON JUNE 28, 1971, AS
ALI WAS LEAVING A CORNER STORE

57:32.241 --> 57:35.935
ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO,
THE SHOPKEEPER HEARD THE NEWS

57:35.969 --> 57:38.869
AND RAN AFTER
HIM TO LET HIM KNOW.

57:38.903 --> 57:41.837
WELL I WAS ON 79th STREET
ON THE SOUTH SIDE AND JUST

57:41.872 --> 57:43.598
BOUGHT ME AN ORANGE
IN A GROCERY STORE,

57:43.632 --> 57:45.807
AND THE GROCERY OWNER
CAME OUT AND GRABBED ME

57:45.841 --> 57:47.636
AND HUGGED ME WITH
TEARS IN HIS EYES,

57:47.671 --> 57:49.983
LITTLE BLACK FELLA,
AND TOLD ME THAT "YOU'VE JUST

57:50.018 --> 57:51.813
"BEEN VINDICATED
AND YOU FREE.

57:51.847 --> 57:54.229
8 JUDGES ALL VOTED
IN YOUR FAVOR."

57:54.263 --> 57:56.783
AND HE JUST HUGGED ME
AND SQUEEZED ME.

57:56.818 --> 57:59.752
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT OUR SYSTEM NOW?

57:59.786 --> 58:02.133
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHO
WILL BE ASSASSINATED TONIGHT.

58:02.168 --> 58:05.033
I DON'T KNOW WHO WILL BE
ENSLAVED OR MISTREATED.

58:05.067 --> 58:07.207
I DON'T KNOW WHO WILL BE
DEPRIVED OF SOME OTHER JUSTICE

58:07.242 --> 58:09.865
OR EQUALITY,
SO I CAN'T SAY NOTHING.

58:09.900 --> 58:12.040
ALL I CAN TALK
ABOUT IS MY CASE.

58:12.074 --> 58:15.526
AND I'M THANKFUL THAT THE
COURTS RECOGNIZED MY SINCERITY

58:15.561 --> 58:17.597
OF MY BELIEFS
IN THIS CASE.

58:17.632 --> 58:20.151
THAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.
OH, THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

58:20.186 --> 58:23.914
I CRIED BECAUSE
I WAS SO HAPPY.

58:23.948 --> 58:26.019
MY BROTHER FACING PRISON,
PRISON SENTENCE

58:26.054 --> 58:27.918
IF HE FOUND GUILTY,

58:27.952 --> 58:30.886
HE WASN'T FOUND GUILTY.
THEY LET HIM GO. HE WAS RIGHT.

58:30.921 --> 58:32.819
THE SUPREME COURT
SAID HE WAS RIGHT.

58:32.854 --> 58:34.787
IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.

58:34.821 --> 58:36.789
IT SHOWS--IT SHOWS
THERE'S A GOD.

58:36.823 --> 58:38.273
IT WAS EASY FOR HIM.

58:38.307 --> 58:40.068
YOU KNOW WHY IT WAS EASY,
YOU KNOW WHY?

58:40.102 --> 58:43.209
BECAUSE IN HIS MIND, HE
WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING.

58:43.243 --> 58:46.005
DO THE RIGHT THING IN LIFE,
YOU'RE HAPPY,

58:46.039 --> 58:48.559
NO MATTER
WHAT PEOPLE SAY.

58:48.594 --> 58:51.182
DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT.

58:51.217 --> 58:54.910
SOMEBODY ASKED ME
ONCE IN HIGH SCHOOL,

58:54.945 --> 58:56.705
"WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
THE WAR IN VIETNAM

58:56.740 --> 58:58.017
AND MAYBE GOING OVER
THERE AND FIGHTING?"

58:58.051 --> 58:59.846
AND I SAID, "LISTEN.

58:59.881 --> 59:01.883
"I CAN'T SEE ANY REASON THAT
I'D BEEN SHOOTING THESE

59:01.917 --> 59:03.816
"VIETNAMESE MEN AND WOMEN.

59:03.850 --> 59:05.852
"WHY WOULD I BE DOING THAT?
WHY WOULD I GO THERE?

59:05.887 --> 59:08.027
WHY WOULD I SUPPORT THAT?"

59:08.061 --> 59:10.754
I THOUGHT IT WAS
MY OWN THOUGHT.

59:12.307 --> 59:16.242
THAT SHOWS HOW
POWERFUL MUHAMMAD ALI IS.

59:16.276 --> 59:19.763
IT WAS A THOUGHT THAT I HAD
GOTTEN FROM HIM, BUT I DIDN'T

59:19.797 --> 59:22.317
EVEN KNOW I'D
GOTTEN IT FROM HIM.

59:22.351 --> 59:25.113
WHEN HE SAYS, "NO VIET CONG
EVER CALLED ME NIGGER,"

59:25.147 --> 59:29.324
I MEAN, SOMEHOW THAT GOT
INTO MY HEAD, BUT NOT UN--

59:29.358 --> 59:30.912
NOT ON PURPOSE,
NOT CONSCIOUSLY.

59:30.946 --> 59:33.708
AND THAT'S A REAL LEADER.

59:33.742 --> 59:38.160
HE INFLUENCES YOU, AND YOU
DON'T KNOW IT'S HAPPENING.

59:40.956 --> 59:44.615
SUPPOSE YOU DO
FIGHT FRAZIER AGAIN
AND BEAT HIM, THEN WHAT?

59:44.650 --> 59:47.618
SUPPOSE I BEAT HIM?
I'M GONNA WHOOP HIM.

59:47.653 --> 59:50.172
I WHOOPED HIM THE FIRST TIME,
I WHOOPED HIM FOR 9 ROUNDS,

59:50.207 --> 59:52.140
BEAT HIM SO TERRIBLE, THEY
PUT HIM IN THE HOSPITAL.

59:52.174 --> 59:54.073
THAT'S WHEN I WAS OFF.

59:54.107 --> 59:56.385
WHEN THEY TOOK MY TITLE,
IF I FOUGHT JOE FRAZIER THEN,

59:56.420 --> 59:58.387
HE'D HAVE BEEN SLAUGHTERED.

59:58.422 --> 1:00:01.045
YOU LET ME GET IN THE RING
WITH JOE FRAZIER ONE MORE TIME,

1:00:01.080 --> 1:00:03.151
AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT
I DO WITH JOE FRAZIER.

1:00:03.185 --> 1:00:04.842
I'M TIRED OF TALKING
ABOUT IT!

1:00:04.877 --> 1:00:06.775
YOU'LL SEE WHAT I DO
WITH JOE FRAZIER!

1:00:10.917 --> 1:00:13.644
JOE FRAZIER WAS
IN NO HURRY TO FIGHT ALI

1:00:13.679 --> 1:00:15.784
OR ANYONE ELSE.

1:00:15.819 --> 1:00:19.167
HE LOVED BEING THE
UNDISPUTED HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION OF THE WORLD

1:00:19.201 --> 1:00:23.447
AND TOURED EUROPE WITH HIS
SOUL BAND, THE KNOCKOUTS.

1:00:28.935 --> 1:00:32.283
HE APPEARED BEFORE THE
SOUTH CAROLINA LEGISLATURE,

1:00:32.318 --> 1:00:34.769
ONE OF THE FIRST
AFRICAN-AMERICANS TO DO SO

1:00:34.803 --> 1:00:36.287
SINCE RECONSTRUCTION.

1:00:36.322 --> 1:00:38.358
WE MUST SAVE OUR PEOPLE.

1:00:38.393 --> 1:00:42.811
AND HE
PURCHASED A 366-ACRE
FORMER RICE PLANTATION

1:00:42.846 --> 1:00:47.471
OUTSIDE BEAUFORT, WHERE
HE MOVED HIS MOTHER, DOLLY.

1:00:47.505 --> 1:00:52.752
ONE AIDE CLAIMED HE WAS
UNLIKELY TO BOX AGAIN THAT YEAR.

1:00:52.787 --> 1:00:55.203
THE FACT IS
THAT YOU'RE A CROWD PULLER

1:00:55.237 --> 1:00:57.826
AND FRAZIER'S NOT, IS HE?
WHY IS THAT?

1:00:57.861 --> 1:00:59.414
WELL, NUMBER ONE,
HE'S UGLY.

1:01:02.762 --> 1:01:08.354
HE HAS NO RHYTHM, NO FOOTWORK,
NO CLASS, HE CANNOT TALK.

1:01:10.287 --> 1:01:12.461
AND WHO TOLD HIM
HE COULD SING?

1:01:12.496 --> 1:01:14.394
HE CANNOT SING.

1:01:14.429 --> 1:01:20.193
BEGINNING IN JULY
OF 1971, ALI, NOW FREE TO BOX

1:01:20.228 --> 1:01:23.887
WHENEVER AND WHEREVER HE
PLEASED, FOUGHT 9 TIMES

1:01:23.921 --> 1:01:28.132
IN 15 MONTHS WHILE WAITING
FOR ANOTHER SHOT AT FRAZIER.

1:01:28.167 --> 1:01:33.724
HIS OPPONENTS--OFTEN SMALLER,
SLOWER, OR PAST THEIR PRIME--

1:01:33.759 --> 1:01:37.521
WERE CAREFULLY CHOSEN TO PROTECT
ALI FROM A SECOND DEFEAT

1:01:37.555 --> 1:01:39.834
THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED
HIS CAREER BEFORE HE COULD

1:01:39.868 --> 1:01:42.284
FACE FRAZIER AGAIN.

1:01:42.319 --> 1:01:44.873
FIRST, HE
DEFEATED HIS BOYHOOD FRIEND

1:01:44.908 --> 1:01:47.358
AND LONGTIME SPARRING PARTNER
JIMMY ELLIS

1:01:47.393 --> 1:01:49.844
AT THE ASTRODOME IN HOUSTON.

1:01:49.878 --> 1:01:54.400
ALI, WHO OUTWEIGHED ELLIS BY
31 POUNDS, LOOKED LISTLESS

1:01:54.434 --> 1:01:56.022
AND UNPREPARED.

1:01:56.057 --> 1:01:58.956
FRAZIER, WHO HAD WATCHED
A CLOSED-CIRCUIT SHOWING

1:01:58.991 --> 1:02:01.890
IN PHILADELPHIA,
WAS UNIMPRESSED.

1:02:01.925 --> 1:02:05.238
HE CALLED ALI A CLOWN AND
ACCUSED HIM OF HIKING UP

1:02:05.273 --> 1:02:06.964
HIS OVER-SIZED TRUNKS

1:02:06.999 --> 1:02:09.553
TO CONCEAL A LAYER OF FAT
AROUND HIS WAIST.

1:02:11.797 --> 1:02:12.936
BUSTER MATHIS.

1:02:12.970 --> 1:02:14.765
JURGEN BLIN.

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:16.180
MAC FOSTER.

1:02:16.215 --> 1:02:18.079
GEORGE CHUVALO.

1:02:18.113 --> 1:02:19.908
JERRY QUARRY.

1:02:19.943 --> 1:02:22.048
ALVIN LEWIS.

1:02:22.083 --> 1:02:23.532
HE BEAT THEM ALL.

1:02:26.087 --> 1:02:28.261
LIFE ON
THE ROAD WAS CHAOTIC.

1:02:28.296 --> 1:02:32.162
BETWEEN WORKOUTS, ALI
GOOFED OFF WITH BUNDINI,

1:02:32.196 --> 1:02:34.923
PLAYED PRANKS ON
UNSUSPECTING COMPANIONS,

1:02:34.958 --> 1:02:38.202
AND SPENT HOURS
IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION.

1:02:38.237 --> 1:02:41.585
HE ALSO SOUGHT TO FULFILL
HIS NEAR-INSATIABLE

1:02:41.619 --> 1:02:45.451
CRAVING FOR SEX, REGULARLY
CHEATING ON HIS WIFE,

1:02:45.485 --> 1:02:48.350
AT TIMES
PAYING WOMEN FOR SEX.

1:02:48.385 --> 1:02:51.353
HIS RENDEZVOUS WERE OFTEN
ARRANGED BY THE MEN

1:02:51.388 --> 1:02:53.493
IN HIS ENTOURAGE.

1:02:53.528 --> 1:02:55.185
YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A THEORY THAT

1:02:55.219 --> 1:02:57.152
THE MORE YOU SAY
HOW GREAT YOU ARE,

1:02:57.187 --> 1:02:59.430
IT REALLY MEANS THAT YOU
DON'T THINK YOU'RE SO GREAT.

1:02:59.465 --> 1:03:01.087
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

1:03:01.122 --> 1:03:03.089
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?WHAT ARE YOUR FAULTS?

1:03:03.124 --> 1:03:04.435
WELL, I HAVE
A LOT OF FAULTS.

1:03:04.470 --> 1:03:06.334
LIKE WHAT?
WHAT'S THE WORST?

1:03:06.368 --> 1:03:09.475
I CAN'T TELL YOU MY WORST
FAULT BECAUSE I'M MARRIED.

1:03:12.409 --> 1:03:14.963
YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

1:03:14.998 --> 1:03:18.829
I THINK HE HAD A GREAT
MORAL COMPASS AS BEING HONEST

1:03:18.864 --> 1:03:20.555
AND CHARITABLE.

1:03:20.589 --> 1:03:25.491
NOW, IF YOU SAY DID HE HAVE
A MORAL COMPASS BEING--

1:03:25.525 --> 1:03:29.391
UH, OBSERVING FIDELITY
WITH HIS WIFE?

1:03:29.426 --> 1:03:31.531
NO. NOT AT ALL.

1:03:33.085 --> 1:03:34.396
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED
YET, ARE YOU?

1:03:34.431 --> 1:03:36.502
ALI WAS A WOMANIZER.

1:03:36.536 --> 1:03:40.092
THAT'S KNOWN, AND I'M NOT
TELLING TALES OUT OF SCHOOL.

1:03:40.126 --> 1:03:41.576
MUHAMMAD ALI FAN.

1:03:45.166 --> 1:03:48.169
I'M SORRY
THAT I DID NOT...

1:03:48.203 --> 1:03:51.620
UM, STEP IN AND ...

1:03:51.655 --> 1:03:54.209
I JUST ALLOWED HIM TO DO
WHATEVER HE WANTED TO DO.

1:03:54.244 --> 1:03:56.971
I--I--I'M SORRY FOR THAT.

1:03:57.005 --> 1:03:58.558
SEE YOU ON TELEVISION.

1:03:58.593 --> 1:04:00.388
YOU WANNA SHOW ME LOVE
AND GIVE ME A HUG?

1:04:00.422 --> 1:04:03.184
I JUST LET HIM
DO WHAT HE HAD TO DO.

1:04:04.599 --> 1:04:07.188
IN SEPTEMBER 1972,

1:04:07.222 --> 1:04:11.054
ALI DEFEATED AN AGING FLOYD
PATTERSON A SECOND TIME.

1:04:11.088 --> 1:04:14.126
IT WOULD BE
PATTERSON'S FINAL FIGHT.

1:04:14.160 --> 1:04:18.371
JOE FRAZIER, INTRODUCED
BEFORE THE BOUT, HAD STOOD

1:04:18.406 --> 1:04:21.892
AT THE CENTER OF THE RING
AND SMILED, WHILE ALI,

1:04:21.927 --> 1:04:24.136
RESTRAINED BY BUNDINI BROWN,

1:04:24.170 --> 1:04:26.276
PRETENDED TO LUNGE
AT THE CHAMPION.

1:04:26.310 --> 1:04:28.657
MUHAMMAD ALI
IS PUTTING ON HIS ACT.

1:04:28.692 --> 1:04:31.074
"LET ME AT HIM.
LET ME AT HIM."

1:04:31.108 --> 1:04:33.110
"LET'S STOP ALL THIS AND DO

1:04:33.145 --> 1:04:35.699
WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT,"
ALI TOLD REPORTERS.

1:04:35.733 --> 1:04:38.564
"TELL FRAZIER TO
QUIT DUCKING ME."

1:04:57.031 --> 1:05:00.310
DESPITE ALI'S VICTORIES,
SOME SPORTSWRITERS SAW

1:05:00.344 --> 1:05:03.416
A DIMINISHED FIGHTER
WHO NOW WON ON GUILE,

1:05:03.451 --> 1:05:06.626
ABSORBED TOO MANY BLOWS
OVER TOO MANY ROUNDS,

1:05:06.661 --> 1:05:10.596
AND DID NOT DESERVE
A REMATCH WITH FRAZIER.

1:05:10.630 --> 1:05:15.256
"HE'S STILL VERY FAST," GEORGE
CHUVALO SAID, "BUT HE MISSED

1:05:15.290 --> 1:05:17.085
"A LOT MORE PUNCHES THIS TIME.

1:05:17.120 --> 1:05:19.225
I DEFINITELY HURT HIM."

1:05:20.709 --> 1:05:24.058
"JOE FRAZIER WOULD SLAUGHTER
ALI," WROTE DICK YOUNG.

1:05:24.092 --> 1:05:29.063
"HE'S JUST A MEMORY OF THE
GREATEST. A GRIM MEMORY."

1:05:31.030 --> 1:05:33.999
BUT HIS TRAINER ANGELO DUNDEE,
WHO HAD WORRIED

1:05:34.033 --> 1:05:36.656
THAT HIS FIGHTER HAD JUST BEEN
GOING THROUGH THE MOTION,

1:05:36.691 --> 1:05:42.248
WAS SURE THAT ANOTHER
FRAZIER FIGHT WOULD
BRING OUT ALI'S BEST.

1:05:42.283 --> 1:05:46.597
THEN, IN NOVEMBER, JOE FRAZIER,
UNDER PRESSURE FROM

1:05:46.632 --> 1:05:50.739
BOXING OFFICIALS TO DEFEND HIS
TITLE AGAINST A TOP CONTENDER,

1:05:50.774 --> 1:05:54.019
SIGNED TO FIGHT
AN UNDEFEATED 23-YEAR-OLD

1:05:54.053 --> 1:05:56.607
NAMED GEORGE FOREMAN.

1:05:56.642 --> 1:06:00.957
ALI'S REMATCH WITH FRAZIER
WOULD HAVE TO WAIT.

1:06:10.621 --> 1:06:12.554
GO GET HIM!

1:06:12.589 --> 1:06:15.488
KNOCK HIM DOWN.

1:06:27.811 --> 1:06:30.331
IN
THE SPRING OF 1972,

1:06:30.365 --> 1:06:32.540
MUHAMMAD ALI
HAD PURCHASED 6 ACRES

1:06:32.574 --> 1:06:35.370
ATOP A RIDGE NEAR DEER LAKE,
PENNSYLVANIA

1:06:35.405 --> 1:06:38.097
AND BEGUN BUILDING
HIS OWN TRAINING CAMP

1:06:38.132 --> 1:06:41.652
EQUIPPED WITH A BOXING GYM,
MOSQUE, MESS HALL,

1:06:41.687 --> 1:06:45.449
AND ENOUGH LODGING
FOR HIS ENTIRE ENTOURAGE.

1:06:45.484 --> 1:06:49.764
ALI AND BELINDA, WHO GAVE BIRTH
THAT MAY TO THEIR 4th CHILD,

1:06:49.798 --> 1:06:52.698
MUHAMMAD ALI JR.,
SCOURED THE AREA

1:06:52.732 --> 1:06:55.356
FOR FURNISHINGS TO
OUTFIT THE COMPOUND.

1:06:55.390 --> 1:06:58.255
THEY BOUGHT ANTIQUE FURNITURE
FOR THE CABINS,

1:06:58.290 --> 1:07:02.294
A 150-YEAR-OLD HORSE-DRAWN
WAGON FOR THE YARD,

1:07:02.328 --> 1:07:04.503
AND A REPLICA
OF THE LIBERTY BELL,

1:07:04.537 --> 1:07:08.231
WHICH THE BOXER PLANNED
30

1:07:08.265 --> 1:07:11.165
TO HERALD
THE START OF HIS DAY.

1:07:11.199 --> 1:07:14.409
ALI HAD HIS FATHER PAINT
MASSIVE BOULDERS SCATTERED

1:07:14.444 --> 1:07:17.516
ACROSS THE GROUNDS WITH
THE NAMES OF CHAMPIONS--

1:07:17.550 --> 1:07:23.453
JOE LOUIS, SONNY LISTON,
ARCHIE MOORE, JACK JOHNSON.

1:07:23.487 --> 1:07:27.077
NOW, MUHAMMAD ALI
DID NOT MEET THE PRESIDENT,

1:07:27.112 --> 1:07:30.391
BUT HE HAPPENED
TO BE PASSING BY
MT. RUSHMORE ONE DAY,

1:07:30.425 --> 1:07:32.358
AND THIS IS
WHAT HAPPENED. OK.

1:07:32.393 --> 1:07:34.843
DO NOT BE SHOCKED,
BECAUSE IT WILL
SOON BE THE TRUTH.

1:07:45.854 --> 1:07:47.753
ONE DAY, WHILE ALI

1:07:47.787 --> 1:07:51.205
WAS TRAINING IN A MAKESHIFT
GYM NEAR THE HALF-BUILT CAMP,

1:07:51.239 --> 1:07:55.416
A 22-YEAR-OLD AMATEUR FIGHTER
FROM NEARBY EASTON, PENNSYLVANIA

1:07:55.450 --> 1:08:00.766
NAMED LARRY HOLMES, SHOWED UP,
EAGER TO MEET HIS IDOL.

1:08:00.800 --> 1:08:05.633
ONE OF 12 KIDS RAISED BY HIS
MOTHER FLOSSIE IN PUBLIC HOUSING

1:08:05.667 --> 1:08:09.464
ON EASTON'S SOUTH SIDE,
HOLMES HAD FIRST BOXED FOR

1:08:09.499 --> 1:08:13.675
HOT DOGS AND SODAS IN THE CITY'S
WEDNESDAY-NIGHT BAR FIGHTS

1:08:13.710 --> 1:08:16.299
AT JUST 10 YEARS OLD.

1:08:16.333 --> 1:08:19.440
WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL,
I WAS IN THE 7th GRADE.

1:08:19.474 --> 1:08:24.790
IT WAS EITHER QUIT
OR GET THROWN OUT.

1:08:24.824 --> 1:08:27.620
THEREFORE, I JUST
DECIDED TO GO.

1:08:27.655 --> 1:08:31.521
YOU KNOW, I WORKED IN THE
CAR WASH, I SHINED SHOES,

1:08:31.555 --> 1:08:37.182
I DID WHATEVER I COULD
DO TO HELP BRING IN
MONEY TO THE HOUSE.

1:08:37.216 --> 1:08:40.150
AND THEN I MET A GUY BY
THE NAME OF ERNIE BUTLER

1:08:40.185 --> 1:08:44.396
TEACHING KIDS HOW TO BOX, AND I
STARTED LEARNING HOW TO BOX.

1:08:46.191 --> 1:08:48.917
BY THE TIME HOLMES
ARRIVED AT DEER LAKE,

1:08:48.952 --> 1:08:51.955
HE WAS HOPING TO MAKE
THE OLYMPIC TEAM.

1:08:51.989 --> 1:08:54.371
ALI PUT UP HIS HAND. HE SAID,
"LET ME SEE YOUR JAB."

1:08:54.406 --> 1:08:56.304
AND LARRY'S HITTING IT.

1:08:56.339 --> 1:08:57.926
"OH, THAT'S GOOD."

1:08:57.961 --> 1:08:59.721
I SAID, "LARRY, DO YOU
HAVE YOUR BOXING STUFF?"

1:08:59.756 --> 1:09:01.378
"YEAH, I HAVE IT."

1:09:01.413 --> 1:09:03.656
ALI SAID, "GOOD.
I NEED A GOOD WORKOUT."

1:09:03.691 --> 1:09:06.176
SO WE GO DOWN, AND THEY SPAR.

1:09:06.211 --> 1:09:08.385
AND LARRY GOT A SHINER.

1:09:08.420 --> 1:09:11.181
AND I SAID, "LARRY, LET ME
PUT SOME ICE ON THIS."

1:09:11.216 --> 1:09:12.665
"NO, NO, NO.

1:09:12.700 --> 1:09:14.391
"I'M GOING BACK TO EASTON,
I'M GOING TO TELL

1:09:14.426 --> 1:09:16.773
"ALL THE PEOPLE, MUHAMMAD
ALI PUT THIS HERE.

1:09:16.807 --> 1:09:18.533
I'M SO PROUD OF THIS."

1:09:18.568 --> 1:09:22.641
AND THEN I INVITED LARRY
TO OUR TRAINING CAMP.

1:09:22.675 --> 1:09:26.300
I WOULD COME IN HERE
AND WASH DISHES IN THE KITCHEN.

1:09:26.334 --> 1:09:31.477
I WOULD SIT IN HIS DRESSING
ROOMS, TALK TO HIM,
AND ASK HIM QUESTIONS,

1:09:31.512 --> 1:09:34.722
AND YOU KNOW,
HE PROBABLY GOT TIRED OF ME

1:09:34.756 --> 1:09:38.622
FOR ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS,
BUT I DID IT ANYWAY.

1:09:38.657 --> 1:09:42.902
THE QUICKNESS AND
THE MOBILITY THAT HE HAD.

1:09:42.937 --> 1:09:47.424
HE COULD DUCK, PULL AWAY FROM
PUNCHES AND STUFF, BLOCK...

1:09:47.459 --> 1:09:48.874
YOU COULDN'T HIT HIM.

1:09:48.908 --> 1:09:50.393
HELLO AGAIN, EVERYONE.

1:09:50.427 --> 1:09:52.878
I'M HOWARD COSELL
ALONG WITH MUHAMMAD ALI

1:09:52.912 --> 1:09:55.674
BRINGING YOU THE
OLYMPIC BOXING TRIALS,

1:09:55.708 --> 1:09:57.538
AND YOU'LL BE SEEING
LARRY HOLMES.

1:09:59.333 --> 1:10:01.852
A LOT OF THE STUFF
THAT ALI DID, I COPY.

1:10:01.887 --> 1:10:03.820
AND EVERYBODY SAY,
"YOU'RE A COPYCAT."

1:10:03.854 --> 1:10:05.856
"OK, SO? AND?
WHAT'S NEXT?"

1:10:05.891 --> 1:10:07.686
HE REMINDS ME OF
MYSELF IN FOOTWORK,

1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:09.826
THE WAY HE'S CONSTANTLY
MOVING AND CIRCLING...

1:10:09.860 --> 1:10:11.448
I'M GONNA
LEARN FROM THE BEST.

1:10:11.483 --> 1:10:12.898
THIS MAN IS THE BEST.

1:10:12.932 --> 1:10:15.003
SO I'M GONNA DO--
I'M GONNA COPY IT.

1:10:15.038 --> 1:10:17.592
GOOD LEFT BY HOLMES.

1:10:17.627 --> 1:10:21.286
IF I CAN'T GET IT,
AT LEAST I GAVE IT A SHOT,

1:10:21.320 --> 1:10:23.253
BUT I'VE WORKED IT
OUT PRETTY GOOD.

1:10:24.668 --> 1:10:27.671
HOLMES FAILED
TO MAKE THE OLYMPIC TEAM,

1:10:27.706 --> 1:10:30.364
BUT CONTINUED TRAINING
WITH ALI AT DEER LAKE,

1:10:30.398 --> 1:10:33.056
EVENTUALLY BEGINNING
A PROFESSIONAL CAREER

1:10:33.090 --> 1:10:37.371
THAT WOULD ONE DAY LEAD
HIM BACK TO HIS MENTOR.

1:10:37.405 --> 1:10:40.615
WE'RE BACK AT
RINGSIDE AND GEORGE FOREMAN,

1:10:40.650 --> 1:10:43.549
THE CHALLENGER, HAS JUST
COME INTO THE RING.

1:10:43.584 --> 1:10:45.586
THERE'S NO FEAR
IN EITHER MAN.

1:10:45.620 --> 1:10:49.762
THERE IS NO FEAR
IN GEORGE FOREMAN.

1:10:49.797 --> 1:10:52.593
HE'S A BIG, STRONG BOY.

1:10:52.627 --> 1:10:54.526
DOWN GOES FRAZIER!

1:10:54.560 --> 1:10:56.390
DOWN GOES FRAZIER!

1:10:56.424 --> 1:10:58.426
DOWN GOES FRAZIER!

1:10:58.461 --> 1:11:03.880
ON JANUARY 23, 1973,
IN KINGSTON, JAMAICA,

1:11:03.914 --> 1:11:08.091
GEORGE FOREMAN SENT JOE FRAZIER
TO THE CANVAS 6 TIMES

1:11:08.125 --> 1:11:13.752
BEFORE THE REFEREE STOPPED
35 OF ROUND 2.

1:11:13.786 --> 1:11:16.720
THERE HE
GOES, 3 TIMES!

1:11:16.755 --> 1:11:19.551
IT IS OVER!
IT IS OVER!

1:11:19.585 --> 1:11:22.070
IT IS OVER IN
THE 2nd ROUND.

1:11:22.105 --> 1:11:24.970
FOREMAN WAS NOW
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION

1:11:25.004 --> 1:11:26.489
OF THE WORLD.

1:11:26.523 --> 1:11:28.353
THEY'RE
CARRYING GEORGE FOREMAN.

1:11:28.387 --> 1:11:31.045
THEY'RE CARRYING GEORGE
FOREMAN ON THEIR SHOULDERS,

1:11:31.079 --> 1:11:32.874
RIGHT OUT OF THE RING.

1:11:32.909 --> 1:11:34.738
JOE FRAZIER IS...

1:11:34.773 --> 1:11:36.568
"I COMPLETELY
UNDERESTIMATED HIM,"

1:11:36.602 --> 1:11:40.019
FRAZIER SAID,
FIGHTING BACK TEARS.

1:11:41.952 --> 1:11:45.542
THE NEXT MORNING, PROMOTERS
FROM NEW YORK TO HONOLULU

1:11:45.577 --> 1:11:48.959
RUSHED TO OFFER FOREMAN A
CHANCE TO DEFEND HIS NEW TITLE

1:11:48.994 --> 1:11:53.585
AGAINST MUHAMMAD ALI, WHILE
OBSERVERS SPECULATED HOW MUCH

1:11:53.619 --> 1:11:55.759
THE MATCH WOULD FETCH.

1:11:55.794 --> 1:11:59.867
ALI, WHO HAD BEEN ASLEEP AT
HIS CAMP IN DEER LAKE DURING

1:11:59.901 --> 1:12:03.146
THE FIGHT, WAS SURE THAT
FRAZIER HAD COST THEM BOTH

1:12:03.180 --> 1:12:06.874
AN ENORMOUS PAY DAY BY
NOT FIGHTING HIM FIRST.

1:12:06.908 --> 1:12:10.498
HE PROMISED TO ANNIHILATE
FOREMAN, BUT NOT BEFORE FACING

1:12:10.533 --> 1:12:15.089
A STRING OF CONTENDERS HE'D
ALREADY AGREED TO FIGHT.

1:12:15.123 --> 1:12:17.747
5 WEEKS LATER, IN SAN DIEGO,

1:12:17.781 --> 1:12:20.474
HE WOULD FIGHT 6TH-RANKED
KEN NORTON,

1:12:20.508 --> 1:12:23.925
A 6'3" EX-MARINE,
WHO HAD BEEN PAID JUST

1:12:23.960 --> 1:12:26.825
$300 FOR HIS PREVIOUS BOUT.

1:12:26.859 --> 1:12:31.485
MUHAMMAD ALI WILL BE COMING TO
YOU ON HOME TELEVISION, LIVE...

1:12:31.519 --> 1:12:33.176
WHEN THE MATCH-UP
FAILED TO SELL

1:12:33.210 --> 1:12:36.386
ENOUGH CLOSED-CIRCUIT TICKETS,
THE PROMOTERS DECIDED

1:12:36.421 --> 1:12:40.770
TO AIR IT LIVE ON ABC'S
"WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS."

1:12:40.804 --> 1:12:43.497
ALI, FIGHTING
THE 6th-RANKED HEAVYWEIGHT

1:12:43.531 --> 1:12:45.395
KENNY NORTON.

1:12:45.430 --> 1:12:47.190
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUT
NORTON AND THIS IS SUPPOSED TO

1:12:47.224 --> 1:12:50.918
BE A ROUTINE EXERCISE FOR ALI.

1:12:50.952 --> 1:12:54.093
ALI ENTERED THE
ARENA WEARING A BEJEWELED ROBE

1:12:54.128 --> 1:12:58.581
WITH THE WORDS "PEOPLE'S CHOICE"
INSCRIBED ON THE BACK.

1:12:58.615 --> 1:13:02.205
IT HAD BEEN A GIFT
FROM ELVIS PRESLEY.

1:13:02.239 --> 1:13:06.002
GOOD LEFT
THERE BY NORTON.
THAT EXCITED THE CROWD.

1:13:06.036 --> 1:13:10.731
KEN NORTON DIDN'T ALLOW
MUHAMMAD TO GET INTO HIS HEAD.

1:13:10.765 --> 1:13:13.941
HE WASN'T INTIMIDATED BY ALI.

1:13:13.975 --> 1:13:15.943
HE WAS A MARINE.

1:13:15.977 --> 1:13:21.431
ALTHOUGH HE STARTED BOXING
LATE, HE HAD GOOD MECHANICS

1:13:21.466 --> 1:13:23.088
AND HE WAS A GOOD ATHLETE.

1:13:23.122 --> 1:13:25.987
THE RIGHT GOT INTO
ALI AND THEN A LEFT.

1:13:26.022 --> 1:13:28.093
HIS PUNCHES
CAME FROM EVERYWHERE.

1:13:28.127 --> 1:13:30.682
IF NOTHING ELSE,
NORTON'S CONFIDENCE
IS GROWING.

1:13:30.716 --> 1:13:34.513
HE JABBED WITH HIS
LEFT HAND DOWN LIKE ALI DID,

1:13:34.548 --> 1:13:37.965
AND ALI NEVER SAW
SOMEONE LIKE THAT BEFORE.

1:13:37.999 --> 1:13:39.967
AND HE OUT-JABBED HIM.

1:13:40.001 --> 1:13:44.937
AND A STRONG JAB IS GONNA
DISCOURAGE YOU FROM THROWING

1:13:44.972 --> 1:13:48.078
YOUR JAB OR THROWING
PUNCHES PERIOD.

1:13:48.113 --> 1:13:51.219
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE YOUR
FOOT OUT THE BACK DOOR.

1:13:51.254 --> 1:13:53.946
SO YOU'RE OFF-BALANCE.

1:13:53.981 --> 1:13:56.846
JOE FRAZIER'D BE LIKE THIS,
YOU KNOW, COMING AND MOVING,

1:13:56.880 --> 1:14:00.746
BOBBING AND WEAVING,
WHEREAS NORTON WAS THIS WAY,

1:14:00.781 --> 1:14:05.648
BLOCKING THE JAB, BLOCKING
THE JAB, BLOCKING THE JAB.

1:14:05.682 --> 1:14:10.100
YOU KNOW, POW!
POW! LIKE THIS.

1:14:10.135 --> 1:14:13.656
SO MUHAMMAD HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO TRY TO GO IN,

1:14:13.690 --> 1:14:16.624
LEAVING HIMSELF
TOTALLY EXPOSED.

1:14:16.659 --> 1:14:19.765
NOT TO MENTION THAT
KEN NORTON COULD CRACK.

1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:22.561
AND HE CAN GET YOUR ATTENTION.

1:14:22.596 --> 1:14:25.978
WHEN YOU THROW SHOTS LIKE
THAT, THAT SPEAKS TO YOUR

1:14:26.013 --> 1:14:28.256
LEVEL OF DISRESPECT
FOR THE GUY.

1:14:28.291 --> 1:14:32.295
HE'S WALKING MUHAMMAD DOWN,
DISRESPECTFULLY.

1:14:32.329 --> 1:14:35.091
I THINK KEN NORTON THOUGHT
THAT HE WAS ON THE SAME LEVEL

1:14:35.125 --> 1:14:37.162
AS MUHAMMAD ALI.

1:14:37.196 --> 1:14:40.786
THERE HASN'T BEEN
MUCH MOVEMENT BY ALI
IN THIS FIGHT.

1:14:40.821 --> 1:14:42.892
WHY?
IT'S HARD TO FIGURE.

1:14:42.926 --> 1:14:46.240
HAS HE GONE BACK THAT FAR?
THAT'S NOT EASILY BELIEVABLE.

1:14:46.274 --> 1:14:50.037
YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF HE'S
TAKING NORTON TOO LIGHTLY.

1:14:50.071 --> 1:14:54.697
IN ROUND 8,
HOWARD COSELL NOTICED
THAT A NEAR-SILENT ALI

1:14:54.731 --> 1:14:57.700
HAD BEGUN MOVING
HIS MOUTH AWKWARDLY.

1:14:59.115 --> 1:15:01.945
ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE BACK FOR ROUND 8,

1:15:01.980 --> 1:15:04.983
AND ALI JUST
HASN'T BEEN RIGHT.

1:15:05.017 --> 1:15:08.952
AND I THINK HE MAY HAVE
CRACKED A TOOTH IN HIS MOUTH

1:15:08.987 --> 1:15:12.680
JUDGING BY THE WAY
HE'S HOLDING HIS MOUTH.

1:15:12.715 --> 1:15:15.925
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET
DR. FERDIE PACHECO
TO TELL US.

1:15:15.959 --> 1:15:18.341
FERDIE, IS THERE ANYTHING
WRONG WITH MUHAMMAD'S MOUTH?

1:15:18.375 --> 1:15:20.239
NO, I THINK, UH,
HE'S LOOSENED A TOOTH

1:15:20.274 --> 1:15:22.103
BUT THERE'S NO FRACTURE,
THERE'S NO BROKEN ANYTHING.

1:15:22.138 --> 1:15:23.795
THERE'S NOTHING, YOU KNOW.

1:15:23.829 --> 1:15:25.900
BUT
PACHECO KNEW BETTER.

1:15:28.316 --> 1:15:30.733
A 2nd-ROUND BLOW BY NORTON

1:15:30.767 --> 1:15:33.321
HAD BROKEN ALI'S
LOWER LEFT JAWBONE,

1:15:33.356 --> 1:15:36.359
THE JAGGED EDGES
DIGGING INTO THE INSIDE

1:15:36.393 --> 1:15:37.878
OF HIS CHEEK.

1:15:37.912 --> 1:15:41.226
A GOOD RIGHT!
HE IS ALL OVER ALI.

1:15:41.260 --> 1:15:44.091
EVERY TIME
NORTON HIT HIM,

1:15:44.125 --> 1:15:46.749
IT WAS JUST PAIN,
PAIN, PAIN.

1:15:46.783 --> 1:15:48.371
THERE'S BLOOD
IN ALI'S MOUTH.

1:15:48.405 --> 1:15:50.925
BECAUSE OF THE JAW,
EVERY PUNCH WAS PAIN.

1:15:50.960 --> 1:15:53.687
ONE HAS TO WONDER,
IS HE NOW BUT A RELIC

1:15:53.721 --> 1:15:55.378
OF THE FIGHTER HE WAS?

1:15:55.412 --> 1:15:59.865
ALI STILL BELIEVED
HE COULD BEAT KEN NORTON.

1:15:59.900 --> 1:16:02.696
LET'S GO, CHAMP!

1:16:02.730 --> 1:16:05.319
ALI IS LANDING IN
THIS ROUND, AS YOU CAN SEE.

1:16:05.353 --> 1:16:06.803
HE IS SCORING.

1:16:08.978 --> 1:16:11.152
HOWEVER, NORTON
KEEPS COMING AT ALI,

1:16:11.187 --> 1:16:14.121
AND ALI IS
AGAINST THE ROPES.

1:16:14.155 --> 1:16:15.847
"YOU
MISSED ME, SUCKER!"

1:16:15.881 --> 1:16:17.676
NORTON JEERED ALI.

1:16:17.711 --> 1:16:20.230
"YOU AIN'T HIT
NOTHIN' BUT A GHOST."

1:16:21.922 --> 1:16:23.958
THIS CROWD
IS GOING WILD.

1:16:23.993 --> 1:16:29.239
THEY ARE SENSING
A DECISION IN FAVOR OF
UNKNOWN KENNY NORTON.

1:16:29.274 --> 1:16:32.346
NOBODY CAN REALLY BELIEVE
WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN.

1:16:32.380 --> 1:16:35.383
IT IS A TIRED ALI
AND A HURT ALI.

1:16:35.418 --> 1:16:40.285
REFEREE
FRANK RUSTITCH SCORES IT

1:16:40.319 --> 1:16:43.978
7 POINTS NORTON,
5 POINTS ALI!

1:16:44.013 --> 1:16:46.429
THERE IT IS!
THERE IT IS!

1:16:46.463 --> 1:16:51.330
ONE OF THE GREATEST UPSETS
AGAIN IN BOXING HISTORY.
KENNY...

1:16:51.365 --> 1:16:53.816
BUNDINI BROWN
AND ANGELO DUNDEE

1:16:53.850 --> 1:16:55.783
RUSHED ALI FROM THE RING,

1:16:55.818 --> 1:16:59.994
AS NORTON EMBRACED HIS OLD
SPARRING PARTNER JOE FRAZIER.

1:17:00.029 --> 1:17:02.721
ALI'S MOUTH
FILLED WITH BLOOD.

1:17:02.756 --> 1:17:06.069
ALI GETS A JAW
OPERATED ON, AND I STAYED

1:17:06.104 --> 1:17:07.933
THERE WITH HIM ALL NIGHT.

1:17:07.968 --> 1:17:12.006
WHEN HE WOKE UP IN THE
MORNING, HE WAS ALL WIRED UP.

1:17:12.041 --> 1:17:14.699
IT WOULD BE
AT LEAST 3 MONTHS

1:17:14.733 --> 1:17:17.184
BEFORE HE COULD
EVEN TRAIN AGAIN.

1:17:19.289 --> 1:17:23.190
THE NEXT DAY, KEN NORTON
STOPPED BY ALI'S HOSPITAL ROOM

1:17:23.224 --> 1:17:25.261
TO PAY HIS RESPECTS.

1:17:25.295 --> 1:17:27.228
HE BROUGHT A PHOTOGRAPHER.

1:17:29.092 --> 1:17:32.302
THE IMAGE OF ALI, STRETCHED
OUT ON A HOSPITAL BED

1:17:32.337 --> 1:17:33.994
WITH NORTON HOVERING OVER HIM,

1:17:34.028 --> 1:17:36.893
APPEARED IN
NEWSPAPERS EVERYWHERE.

1:17:36.928 --> 1:17:40.207
HOWARD COSELL
DECLARED HIM FINISHED.

1:17:40.241 --> 1:17:46.938
RED SMITH CALLED THE BOXER
A LIMP EFFIGY OF MUHAMMAD ALI.

1:17:46.972 --> 1:17:49.837
IT HAD BEEN NEARLY A DECADE
SINCE HE HAD STOPPED

1:17:49.872 --> 1:17:52.909
SONNY LISTON TO BECOME
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION.

1:17:52.944 --> 1:17:57.776
MANY OBSERVERS WONDERED IF HIS
FOOT AND HAND SPEED WERE GONE,

1:17:57.811 --> 1:18:00.883
IF HE STILL POSSESSED THE WILL
TO TRAIN PROPERLY,

1:18:00.917 --> 1:18:05.957
IF HIS BRUTAL BOUT WITH
FRAZIER HAD CAUSED MORE
HARM THAN ACKNOWLEDGED,

1:18:05.991 --> 1:18:10.133
IF HE COULD EVER
BE THE SAME FIGHTER.

1:18:10.168 --> 1:18:14.379
JUST BEFORE HE'D FACED NORTON,
HERBERT MUHAMMAD HAD CHIDED ALI

1:18:14.413 --> 1:18:17.451
FOR POOR CONDITIONING
AND OVERCONFIDENCE.

1:18:17.485 --> 1:18:21.420
HE'D TRAINED FOR JUST 3 WEEKS,
SKIPPED ROADWORK,

1:18:21.455 --> 1:18:25.045
AND HAD APPEARED OUT OF BREATH
WHILE PUNCHING THE HEAVY BAG

1:18:25.079 --> 1:18:28.738
AND JUMPING ROPE DURING
WORKOUTS IN SAN DIEGO.

1:18:28.773 --> 1:18:31.776
HE HAD ALSO SPENT THE HOURS
LEADING UP TO THE FIGHT

1:18:31.810 --> 1:18:33.950
IN BED WITH TWO WOMEN.

1:18:36.228 --> 1:18:39.404
BEFORE LEAVING THE HOSPITAL,
THE NURSES HAD GIVEN ALI

1:18:39.438 --> 1:18:42.165
A STACK OF LETTERS
ADDRESSED TO HIM.

1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:45.513
"THE BUTTERFLY HAS LOST
ITS WINGS," READ ONE.

1:18:45.548 --> 1:18:47.964
"THE BEE HAS LOST ITS STING.

1:18:47.999 --> 1:18:51.312
YOUR MOUTH HAS BEEN SHUT UP
FOR ALL TIMES."

1:18:51.347 --> 1:18:56.076
LATER, HE WOULD TAPE IT TO
THE GYM WALL FOR INSPIRATION.

1:18:56.110 --> 1:18:58.285
AND WOULD YOU WELCOME,
THE INCREDIBLE MUHAMMAD ALI.

1:19:01.322 --> 1:19:04.153
IN SPITE OF ALL THE
DOUBTS AND THE INJURY THAT

1:19:04.187 --> 1:19:07.950
LEFT HIM MUZZLED AND
TEMPORARILY UNABLE TO TRAIN,

1:19:07.984 --> 1:19:11.470
ALI REMAINED BOXING'S
BIGGEST ATTRACTION, THE MOST

1:19:11.505 --> 1:19:13.990
COMPELLING ATHLETE ANYWHERE.

1:19:14.025 --> 1:19:15.509
I HEARD YOU
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TALK

1:19:15.543 --> 1:19:17.269
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

1:19:17.304 --> 1:19:18.788
NO. THE DOCTOR TOLD ME
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO,

1:19:18.823 --> 1:19:20.100
BUT I TOLD HIM
HE'S WRONG.

1:19:22.965 --> 1:19:24.242
IF THEY TOLD
YOU TOMORROW

1:19:24.276 --> 1:19:25.588
THAT YOU COULD
NOT FIGHT AGAIN,

1:19:25.622 --> 1:19:26.969
IF THEY HAD A LOOK
AT YOUR JAW AND SAID

1:19:27.003 --> 1:19:28.211
"IT'S JUST TOO
DANGEROUS,"

1:19:28.246 --> 1:19:30.489
WOULD YOU--
WOULD YOU CRY?

1:19:30.524 --> 1:19:33.147
NO. I'D REJOICE.

1:19:33.182 --> 1:19:36.944
I'D BE GLAD THAT I FOUND OUT
BEFORE I KILLED MYSELF.

1:19:43.951 --> 1:19:46.885
WHEN ALI AND NORTON
AGREED TO A REMATCH

1:19:46.920 --> 1:19:52.235
IN LOS ANGELES IN SEPTEMBER OF
1973, EVEN PERSISTENT CRITICS,

1:19:52.270 --> 1:19:55.514
EAGER TO FILL THEIR NOTEBOOKS
AGAIN WITH ALI'S QUIPS

1:19:55.549 --> 1:19:57.827
AND PREDICTIONS, REJOICED.

1:19:57.862 --> 1:19:59.587
THIS AIN'T NO BIG THING
BEATIN' KEN NORTON.

1:19:59.622 --> 1:20:02.142
THIS MAN WASN'T NOBODY
AND STILL AIN'T NOBODY.

1:20:02.176 --> 1:20:04.592
I JUST MADE HIM SOMEBODY BY
NOT TRAINING AND COMIN' IN

1:20:04.627 --> 1:20:06.456
TOO FAT AND GETTING'
MY JAW BROKE

1:20:06.491 --> 1:20:08.113
AND COULDN'T PULL OUT OF IT.

1:20:08.148 --> 1:20:10.046
THIS TIME, IT'LL BE NO MATCH.

1:20:10.081 --> 1:20:12.117
"THE NORTON FIGHT
WAS GOD'S WARNING,"

1:20:12.152 --> 1:20:14.085
ALI TOLD THE PRESS.

1:20:14.119 --> 1:20:16.535
"HE WAS PUNISHING ME FOR DOING
THINGS NOT ACCORDING

1:20:16.570 --> 1:20:19.055
TO MY RELIGIOUS BELIEFS."

1:20:19.090 --> 1:20:25.372
IN LATE MAY, ALI, NOW 31 YEARS
OLD, WITH A RECORD OF 41 WINS

1:20:25.406 --> 1:20:28.996
AND 2 LOSSES--TO JOE FRAZIER
AND KEN NORTON--

1:20:29.031 --> 1:20:32.620
WITHDREW TO DEER LAKE
TO BEGIN TRAINING.

1:20:32.655 --> 1:20:34.036
AFTER I ANNIHILATE
KEN NORTON,

1:20:34.070 --> 1:20:35.416
GOING TO JAKARTA, INDONESIA

1:20:35.451 --> 1:20:36.901
TO WHUP THIS
RUDIE LUBBERS,

1:20:36.935 --> 1:20:38.454
THE DUTCH HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION.

1:20:38.488 --> 1:20:40.145
I WANNA COME BACK AND
SETTLE THIS WHOLE THING

1:20:40.180 --> 1:20:41.664
WITH GEORGE FOREMAN,
AND FOR OLD TIMES' SAKES,

1:20:41.698 --> 1:20:43.286
I'M GONNA WHUP JOE FRAZIER
AGAIN RIGHT THERE

1:20:43.321 --> 1:20:45.047
IN MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.

1:20:45.081 --> 1:20:46.462
AND I'M TIRED.
I GOTTA GO TO WORK.

1:20:46.496 --> 1:20:48.222
I AIN'T GOT NO TIME
TO BE TALKING.

1:20:50.155 --> 1:20:53.469
ALI PLANNED TO RUN
4 MILES A DAY, AND HE WOULD

1:20:53.503 --> 1:20:57.611
REFRAIN FROM SPARRING UNTIL
3 WEEKS BEFORE THE FIGHT.

1:20:57.645 --> 1:21:00.269
"I CAN'T PLAY NO MORE,"
HE SAID.

1:21:00.303 --> 1:21:04.031
"I'LL BE DAMN SERIOUS
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING."

1:21:14.939 --> 1:21:17.113
CAN YOU BELIEVE
WHAT YOU SEEING?

1:21:17.148 --> 1:21:21.186
LOOK LIKE I'M 20 YEARS OLD,
GOING BACK IN TIME.

1:21:21.221 --> 1:21:24.431
AT THE CAMP,
ALI WAS NEVER ALONE.

1:21:24.465 --> 1:21:29.332
HIS ASSOCIATE GENE KILROY
MADE ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS.

1:21:29.367 --> 1:21:33.405
LUIS SARRIA, ALI'S MASSEUR,
WORE THE BOXER OUT WITH HIS

1:21:33.440 --> 1:21:36.132
DEMANDING EXERCISE ROUTINES.

1:21:36.167 --> 1:21:39.377
BUNDINI BROWN RAISED
EVERYONE'S SPIRITS,

1:21:39.411 --> 1:21:44.934
WHILE LANA SHABBAZ KEPT THE
ENTIRE ENTOURAGE WELL FED.

1:21:44.969 --> 1:21:48.938
BELINDA BROUGHT THEIR KIDS
UP FROM CHERRY HILL OFTEN,

1:21:48.973 --> 1:21:50.560
BUT SELDOM STAYED LONG.

1:21:50.595 --> 1:21:54.116
ALI'S PARENTS VISITED
REGULARLY, HELPING

1:21:54.150 --> 1:21:57.050
IN THE KITCHEN,
AND HIS BROTHER, RAHAMAN

1:21:57.084 --> 1:21:59.569
SERVED AS A
SPARRING PARTNER.

1:21:59.604 --> 1:22:03.401
HOWARD BINGHAM
PHOTOGRAPHED IT ALL.

1:22:03.435 --> 1:22:07.025
"THESE PEOPLE ARE LIKE A
LITTLE TOWN FOR MUHAMMAD ALI,"

1:22:07.060 --> 1:22:08.993
HERBERT MUHAMMAD SAID.

1:22:09.027 --> 1:22:14.101
"HE'S THE SHERIFF, THE JUDGE,
THE MAYOR, AND THE TREASURER."

1:22:14.136 --> 1:22:15.620
I'M TRIM.
MY JAW IS READY.

1:22:15.654 --> 1:22:18.347
LOOK AT MY BODY. LOOK AT IT.
IN PERFECT SHAPE.

1:22:18.381 --> 1:22:21.246
212 POUNDS, SAME WEIGHT
I FOUGHT SONNY LISTON.

1:22:21.281 --> 1:22:23.248
I CHOPPED DOWN 85 TREES
FOR THIS FIGHT.

1:22:23.283 --> 1:22:25.250
TALKIN' BOUT NORTON
CLOSING MY MOUTH.

1:22:25.285 --> 1:22:27.149
YOU TELL NORTON
HE OPENED MY MOUTH WIDER.

1:22:27.183 --> 1:22:28.460
DON'T BELIEVE THAT STUFF.
PREDICTIN' ON THE PREDICTER.

1:22:28.495 --> 1:22:30.290
I'M GONNA BE SO FAST.

1:22:30.324 --> 1:22:32.085
WATCH WHAT IMMA DO WITH MY HANDS
IN THE RING THAT NIGHT.

1:22:32.119 --> 1:22:34.466
IMMA BE SO FAST, IF NORTON
DOING THE DIRTY STUFF,

1:22:34.501 --> 1:22:36.744
IMMA REACH FROM NOWHERE
AND PULL OUT A LONG CANE.

1:22:36.779 --> 1:22:39.471
AND I--

1:22:43.544 --> 1:22:45.339
MY DAD WOULD

1:22:45.374 --> 1:22:51.518
ACTUALLY DRIVE HIS BLUEBIRD
BUS FROM CHERRY HILL

1:22:51.552 --> 1:22:54.762
TO DEER LAKE.

1:22:54.797 --> 1:23:01.355
AND WE WOULD ALL PACK IN
THE BUS AND HIS ENTOURAGE

1:23:01.390 --> 1:23:03.806
AND THE BABYSITTERS
AND ALL OF US WOULD GO,

1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:07.189
AND MY MOM AND ALL
OF US WOULD BE THERE.

1:23:07.223 --> 1:23:09.812
DADDY HAD A WAGON.

1:23:09.846 --> 1:23:13.816
HE WOULD DRAG US
IN THE WAGON.

1:23:13.850 --> 1:23:17.785
WE HAD PONIES THERE.
WE WOULD RIDE.

1:23:17.820 --> 1:23:21.341
I CAN SMELL THE CEDAR WOOD.

1:23:22.583 --> 1:23:24.275
FOND MEMORIES.

1:23:24.309 --> 1:23:26.725
I'VE JUST COME TO SEE
MY DAUGHTER FOR A...

1:23:28.658 --> 1:23:30.281
MOST EVENINGS
AFTER DINNER,

1:23:30.315 --> 1:23:33.146
THE GYM BECAME
A MAKESHIFT MOVIE HOUSE

1:23:33.180 --> 1:23:37.046
AS EVERYONE
PILED IN FOR A SCREENING.

1:23:37.081 --> 1:23:41.292
OCCASIONALLY, ON CLEAR NIGHTS,
WHEN BELINDA VISITED,

1:23:41.326 --> 1:23:45.054
SHE AND ALI WOULD SIT IN
THE QUARRY WAGON AND SEARCH

1:23:45.089 --> 1:23:48.437
THE SKIES FOR THE MOTHERSHIP
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD HAD PROMISED

1:23:48.471 --> 1:23:50.266
WAS ORBITING ABOVE.

1:23:50.301 --> 1:23:52.751
YOU MRS. MUHAMMAD ALI.

1:23:52.786 --> 1:23:57.239
BY THE TIME HIS
TRAINER ANGELO DUNDEE ARRIVED
3 WEEKS BEFORE THE FIGHT,

1:23:57.273 --> 1:24:00.276
ALI WAS WELL-RESTED,
IN HIGH SPIRITS,

1:24:00.311 --> 1:24:02.520
AND IN EXCELLENT SHAPE.

1:24:04.660 --> 1:24:10.424
ON SEPTEMBER 10, 1973,
ALI FACED KEN NORTON AGAIN

1:24:10.459 --> 1:24:13.565
AT THE FORUM IN
INGLEWOOD, CALIFORNIA.

1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:16.534
ALI HAS NOT STOPPED
DANCING FOR A SECOND.

1:24:16.568 --> 1:24:20.262
THIS IS THE BEST I'VE SEEN ALI
LOOK SINCE GOING BACK BEFORE

1:24:20.296 --> 1:24:21.642
THE JOE FRAZIER FIGHT.

1:24:21.677 --> 1:24:22.816
IT'S THE OLD ALI.

1:24:22.850 --> 1:24:24.645
YES, IT IS.

1:24:26.578 --> 1:24:29.823
ALI STAYED ON HIS
TOES THIS TIME AND SHOWED

1:24:29.857 --> 1:24:32.205
MORE STAMINA
THAN HE HAD IN YEARS.

1:24:32.239 --> 1:24:34.138
WHAT A FIGHT!

1:24:34.172 --> 1:24:36.209
BOTH MEN HAVE BEEN HURT.

1:24:36.243 --> 1:24:38.694
THE CROWD IS GOING
ABSOLUTELY BERSERK,

1:24:38.728 --> 1:24:40.627
AS THESE FINE
HEAVYWEIGHTS UNLEASH--

1:24:40.661 --> 1:24:42.456
FIGHT OF THE YEAR!

1:24:42.491 --> 1:24:44.596
THE TWO FIGHTERS
BATTLED TO A DRAW

1:24:44.631 --> 1:24:46.667
OVER THE FIRST 11 ROUNDS.

1:24:46.702 --> 1:24:48.911
12th AND FINAL ROUND.

1:24:48.945 --> 1:24:52.259
BUT IN THE 12th,
ALI UNLEASHED A BARRAGE

1:24:52.294 --> 1:24:55.814
TO NORTON'S HEAD,
OVERWHELMING HIS OPPONENT

1:24:55.849 --> 1:24:59.404
AND TILTING THE DECISION
IN HIS FAVOR.

1:25:01.406 --> 1:25:03.374
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE
WITH MUHAMMAD HERE.

1:25:03.408 --> 1:25:05.755
CHAMP, A GREAT FIGHT.

1:25:05.790 --> 1:25:07.550
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN IN
THIS KIND OF CONDITION

1:25:07.585 --> 1:25:09.725
I'M SURE FOR MANY YEARS
AND YOU HAD TO BE.

1:25:09.759 --> 1:25:12.417
RIGHT. I'M IN
GOOD CONDITION,

1:25:12.452 --> 1:25:18.665
BUT I'M TIREDER THAN USUAL
BECAUSE OF MY AGE.

1:25:18.699 --> 1:25:21.599
NO SOONER HAD HE
BEEN DECLARED THE WINNER

1:25:21.633 --> 1:25:26.190
THAN THE PRESS TURNED
ITS ATTENTION TO
A LONG-ANTICIPATED FIGHT,

1:25:26.224 --> 1:25:30.435
FINALLY IN THE PLANNING
A REMATCH BETWEEN ALI

1:25:30.470 --> 1:25:32.782
AND JOE FRAZIER.

1:25:32.817 --> 1:25:35.889
SOME WRITERS SAW IT AS
A BATTLE OF HAS-BEENS,

1:25:35.923 --> 1:25:40.687
WHOSE FAILURE TO FIGHT YEARS
EARLIER HAD COST THEM MILLIONS.

1:25:40.721 --> 1:25:43.724
BUT THE REMATCH WOULD
BE A HUGE DRAW,

1:25:43.759 --> 1:25:48.660
AND THE WINNER WOULD BE IN
LINE TO FIGHT GEORGE FOREMAN.

1:25:48.695 --> 1:25:53.286
IT'S "TWO MEN ON A PRECIPICE,"
WROTE SPORTSWRITER MARK KRAM,

1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:58.222
"AND POSSIBLY ONLY ONE WILL
PICK UP HIS TALENT AND GO ON."

1:25:58.256 --> 1:25:59.499
I'LL TAKE HIM.
I KNOW I'LL TAKE HIM.

1:25:59.533 --> 1:26:00.914
AND WHERE?

1:26:00.948 --> 1:26:02.502
ANYWHERE!
THE STREET FIGHT AND THE RING.

1:26:02.536 --> 1:26:03.882
KEEPS CALLING ME CLAY!

1:26:03.917 --> 1:26:05.574
HE'S STILL
CALLING ME CLAY!

1:26:05.608 --> 1:26:07.955
I'M GOING TO GET ALL THE
UNCLE TOMS OUT OF BOXING.

1:26:07.990 --> 1:26:10.303
I'M TIRED OF ALL THESE
UNCLE TOM NEGROES.

1:26:10.337 --> 1:26:11.821
YOU A ONE-SIDED GUY.

1:26:11.856 --> 1:26:13.927
YOU--YOU TALK FROM
TWO SIDE OF YOUR MOUTH!

1:26:13.961 --> 1:26:15.929
ONE TO THE WHITE
AND ONE TO THE BLACK.

1:26:17.620 --> 1:26:20.623
IN THE 2 1/2 YEARS
SINCE THEIR FIRST FIGHT,

1:26:20.658 --> 1:26:25.318
THE TWO MEN HAD MADE
LITTLE EFFORT TO EASE THE
ACRIMONY BETWEEN THEM.

1:26:25.352 --> 1:26:26.767
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING, BOY.
SOMEBODY TOLD ME...

1:26:26.802 --> 1:26:27.906
I DUNNO,
WHAT'S THAT WORD?

1:26:27.941 --> 1:26:29.494
I SAID ROY.
OH.

1:26:31.013 --> 1:26:33.257
DO YOU
REALLY DISLIKE ALI?

1:26:33.291 --> 1:26:34.706
WELL, YA KNOW.

1:26:34.741 --> 1:26:37.330
NOTHING TO WRITE HOME
TO MOMMA ABOUT, YA KNOW.

1:26:37.364 --> 1:26:39.263
I GOT
A SPARRING PARTNER.

1:26:39.297 --> 1:26:41.403
LET HIM OUT!
LET HIM OUT!

1:26:41.437 --> 1:26:43.957
"WE WANT EACH
OTHER BAD," SAID FRAZIER,

1:26:43.991 --> 1:26:47.616
WHO CONTINUED TO
REFER TO ALI AS CLAY.

1:26:47.650 --> 1:26:50.826
"IF YOU'VE BEEN AROUND THIS
GUY LONG ENOUGH, YOU CAN HAVE

1:26:50.860 --> 1:26:53.691
A LOT OF HATE IN YOUR
HEART WHEN THE BELL RINGS."

1:26:53.725 --> 1:26:56.418
THIS GETS ME READY
FOR JOE FRAZIER.

1:26:56.452 --> 1:26:57.971
HE RESEMBLES JOE FRAZIER.

1:26:58.005 --> 1:26:59.662
TIME!

1:27:00.905 --> 1:27:02.389
JOE,
DOES THIS GET YOU

1:27:02.424 --> 1:27:03.459
MORE DETERMINED
TO BEAT HIM?

1:27:03.494 --> 1:27:05.565
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.

1:27:05.599 --> 1:27:06.807
SO WHEN
THEY COME TOGETHER,

1:27:06.842 --> 1:27:08.775
THERE'S NO
TITLE AT STAKE.

1:27:08.809 --> 1:27:12.882
AND I ASKED ALI, "WHY WOULD
PEOPLE COME TO THIS FIGHT

1:27:12.917 --> 1:27:14.781
"WITHOUT A TITLE,
YOU KNOW,

1:27:14.815 --> 1:27:16.852
AFTER FRAZIER
GOT BEAT SO BADLY BY FOREMAN?"

1:27:16.886 --> 1:27:19.337
AND I WAS OUT 4 YEARS
AND CAME BACK
AND WHOOPED YOU.

1:27:19.372 --> 1:27:24.825
HE SAID, "YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE COME TO SEE ME,

1:27:24.860 --> 1:27:30.486
BUT IF THERE'S NO JOE FRAZIER,
THEY CAN'T SEE ME AT MY BEST."

1:27:30.521 --> 1:27:33.006
PEOPLE ASK ME,
WHAT WAS ALI'S BEST FIGHT?

1:27:33.040 --> 1:27:34.732
SECOND FRAZIER FIGHT.

1:27:36.906 --> 1:27:38.908
ALI TRAINED REAL WELL.

1:27:38.943 --> 1:27:41.704
HEAVY BAG, SPEED BAG,
GOOD SPARRING PARTNERS

1:27:41.739 --> 1:27:44.500
IN THE COLD WEATHER, RAN.

1:27:44.535 --> 1:27:46.951
HIS MOM AND DAD WERE
COOKING AT THE CAMP,

1:27:46.985 --> 1:27:49.747
HIS BROTHER RAHAMAN,
EVERYBODY.

1:27:49.781 --> 1:27:53.095
EVERYTHING WAS
HITTING, EVERYTHING.

1:27:53.129 --> 1:27:55.511
ALI HAD THE RIGHT INGREDIENTS.

1:27:57.030 --> 1:28:01.379
I'M READY TO WHOOP
JOE FRAZIER AGAIN...

1:28:01.414 --> 1:28:05.349
BUT THIS TIME I'LL
MAKE IT MORE CLEAR.

1:28:05.383 --> 1:28:07.454
I'M SERIOUS THIS TIME.

1:28:07.489 --> 1:28:11.424
JOE FRAZIER, WHO HAD
DEFENDED HIS TITLE JUST TWICE

1:28:11.458 --> 1:28:15.911
BEFORE LOSING IT TO
FOREMAN, TRAINED WITH A
SINGLE-MINDED ZEAL AS WELL,

1:28:15.945 --> 1:28:18.534
SHAPING HIS BODY,
ONE WRITER SAID,

1:28:18.569 --> 1:28:21.744
"LIKE A MAN HAMMERING
A STRIP OF HOT STEEL."

1:28:21.779 --> 1:28:27.578
ON JANUARY 23rd, 5 DAYS BEFORE
THE FIGHT, THE TWO MEN JOINED

1:28:27.612 --> 1:28:29.959
HOWARD COSELL
TO TAPE A SEGMENT

1:28:29.994 --> 1:28:32.514
FOR ABC'S
"WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS."

1:28:32.548 --> 1:28:33.756
THAT SHOWS
HOW DUMB YOU ARE

1:28:33.791 --> 1:28:34.930
HOW COME PEOPLE--

1:28:34.964 --> 1:28:36.552
HE BROUGHT UP
THE HOSPITAL.

1:28:36.587 --> 1:28:38.140
HE GONNA BRING UP
THE HOSPITAL. SO IGNORANT.

1:28:38.174 --> 1:28:40.556
WHAT DIFFERENCE?
WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M IGNORANT?

1:28:40.591 --> 1:28:41.799
I WENT TO THE
HOSPITAL FOR--

1:28:41.833 --> 1:28:43.007
WHY YOU THINK
I'M IGNORANT?

1:28:43.041 --> 1:28:44.388
HOW WOULD I KNOW?

1:28:44.422 --> 1:28:45.768
WHY YOU THINK
I'M IGNORANT?

1:28:45.803 --> 1:28:48.357
MAN, SET DOWN.
SET DOWN.

1:28:48.392 --> 1:28:49.634
SET DOWN, JOE.

1:28:49.669 --> 1:28:50.808
WHY YOU THINK
I'M IGNORANT?

1:28:50.842 --> 1:28:52.050
SET DOWN, JOE.
SET DOWN, QUICK.

1:28:52.085 --> 1:28:53.431
WHY YOU THINK
I'M IGNORANT?

1:28:53.466 --> 1:28:54.467
THE BROTHERS
ARE HERE.

1:28:54.501 --> 1:28:55.537
YOU IN THIS, TOO?

1:28:55.571 --> 1:28:57.780
SET DOWN, QUICK, JOE!

1:29:00.783 --> 1:29:04.097
THIS KIND OF THING
HAS BEEN GOING ON ALL ALONG

1:29:04.131 --> 1:29:05.754
IN TERMS OF PROMOTION
OF THE FIGHT,

1:29:05.788 --> 1:29:08.101
AND THIS TIME IT SEEMS
TO BE FOR REAL,

1:29:08.135 --> 1:29:10.966
BECAUSE JOE FRAZIER
IS REALLY ANGRY.

1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:14.176
MUHAMMAD CALLED HIM IGNORANT
AND HE'S REALLY ANGRY.

1:29:14.210 --> 1:29:17.800
I DON'T THINK THIS ONE
IS CLOWNING AT ALL.

1:29:17.835 --> 1:29:19.768
IT'S A BAD
AND AN UGLY SCENE...

1:29:19.802 --> 1:29:21.079
YOU HAVE TO BE CRUEL

1:29:21.114 --> 1:29:23.047
TO BE A FIGHTER,
TO BEGIN WITH.

1:29:23.081 --> 1:29:25.532
YOU HAVE TO BE
CRUEL IN THE RING.

1:29:25.567 --> 1:29:28.915
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
CRUEL OUTSIDE THE RING.

1:29:28.949 --> 1:29:33.885
MY DIME STORE PSYCHOLOGY ON
THE WHOLE THING WAS THAT

1:29:33.920 --> 1:29:38.200
ALI WAS CRUELEST WHEN
HE WAS MOST AFRAID,

1:29:38.234 --> 1:29:41.514
AND I THINK HE WAS MOST
AFRAID OF JOE FRAZIER.

1:29:41.548 --> 1:29:44.655
THE DEPLORABLE CONDUCT OF
MUHAMMAD ALI AND JOE FRAZIER...

1:29:44.689 --> 1:29:48.797
AFTER THE TUSSLE,
EACH BOXER WAS FINED $5,000

1:29:48.831 --> 1:29:52.179
BY THE NEW YORK STATE
ATHLETIC COMMISSION.

1:29:52.214 --> 1:29:56.977
THIS TIME, LAS VEGAS
ODDSMAKERS FAVORED ALI.

1:29:57.012 --> 1:29:58.703
HERE HE COMES!

1:29:58.738 --> 1:30:03.121
- - 26 P.M.
ON JANUARY 28, 1974,

1:30:03.156 --> 1:30:06.021
BEFORE A SOLD-OUT
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN,

1:30:06.055 --> 1:30:08.644
MUHAMMAD ALI
ENTERED THE RING.

1:30:08.679 --> 1:30:10.991
HERE COMES
JOE FRAZIER. SMOKIN' JOE.

1:30:11.026 --> 1:30:14.823
FRAZIER
FOLLOWED A MINUTE LATER.

1:30:14.857 --> 1:30:17.239
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE
MAN MANY CONSIDER THE MOST

1:30:17.273 --> 1:30:20.725
SPECTACULAR ATHLETE OF
ALL TIME--MUHAMMAD ALI.

1:30:22.520 --> 1:30:25.558
JOE FRAZIER GETS A CHANCE TO
PROVE TONIGHT WHAT HE THOUGHT

1:30:25.592 --> 1:30:28.215
HE PROVED 3 YEARS AGO--

1:30:28.250 --> 1:30:30.045
THAT HE'S A BETTER FIGHTER
THAN MUHAMMAD ALI.

1:30:30.079 --> 1:30:34.636
JOE'S COMING OFF THE LOSS
AGAINST GEORGE FOREMAN.

1:30:34.670 --> 1:30:39.468
SO THAT'S GONNA AFFECT
THE LEVEL OF THE CRAFT.

1:30:39.503 --> 1:30:46.130
BUT WITH ALI AND JOE, IT WAS
ALWAYS HUGELY PERSONAL.

1:30:46.164 --> 1:30:48.857
THESE GUYS DESPISE EACH OTHER.

1:30:48.891 --> 1:30:52.239
THEY'RE FOES FOR LIFE.

1:30:54.172 --> 1:30:56.899
IN THE 1st ROUND,
ALI SHUFFLED AND JABBED

1:30:56.934 --> 1:30:59.212
AND KEPT FRAZIER FROM
FINDING HIS RHYTHM.

1:30:59.246 --> 1:31:01.490
FRAZIER'S
COMING IN WIDE OPEN.

1:31:01.525 --> 1:31:03.285
WIDE OPEN!

1:31:03.319 --> 1:31:07.185
THE QUESTION IS IF
FRAZIER CAN HOLD UP
UNDER THIS PUNISHMENT

1:31:07.220 --> 1:31:09.118
AND ALI SLOWS DOWN.

1:31:09.153 --> 1:31:12.708
LATE IN THE 2nd,
ALI WOBBLED FRAZIER

1:31:12.743 --> 1:31:14.676
WITH A STIFF
RIGHT TO HIS HEAD.

1:31:14.710 --> 1:31:16.816
ALI IS
DOMINATING THE FIGHT.

1:31:16.850 --> 1:31:20.751
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THIS FIGHT AND THE FIRST FIGHT

1:31:20.785 --> 1:31:24.858
IS THAT MUHAMMAD IS FOCUSED
ON MAKING JOE FIND HIM

1:31:24.893 --> 1:31:26.860
THROUGH HIS MOVEMENT.

1:31:26.895 --> 1:31:29.276
AND WHEN YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKE A GUY FIND YOU,

1:31:29.311 --> 1:31:31.313
YOU CAN DISRUPT HIS RHYTHM.

1:31:31.347 --> 1:31:35.662
BECAUSE IF I'M MOVING,
YOU DON'T CONTROL WHEN I PUNCH.

1:31:35.697 --> 1:31:37.008
I CONTROL WHEN YOU PUNCH.

1:31:37.043 --> 1:31:39.908
ALI KEEPING
FRAZIER OFF-BALANCE.

1:31:39.942 --> 1:31:42.945
AS THE FIGHT
WENT ON, ALI MIXED HIS JABS

1:31:42.980 --> 1:31:46.811
WITH HOOKS AND COMBINATIONS,
AND RELIED ON CLINCHES

1:31:46.846 --> 1:31:48.641
TO STIFLE FRAZIER'S ATTACK.

1:31:48.675 --> 1:31:51.057
ALI DOING THE HOLDING.

1:31:51.091 --> 1:31:54.647
IN THE FIRST FIGHT, JOE WAS
LIKE THE TASMANIAN DEVIL.

1:31:54.681 --> 1:31:56.649
HE WAS--HE NEVER
STOPPED PUNCHING.

1:31:56.683 --> 1:31:59.341
AND IF ALI HELD HIM, YOU COULD
SEE JOE LIKE TAKE HIS HANDS

1:31:59.375 --> 1:32:03.725
AND PUT 'EM DOWN AND
JUST PUN--KEPT ON PUNCHING.

1:32:03.759 --> 1:32:06.866
WHEN ALI HELD JOE
IN THE SECOND FIGHT,

1:32:06.900 --> 1:32:09.800
YOU NEVER SAW JOE
REACT LIKE THAT.

1:32:09.834 --> 1:32:12.665
HE'S COOPERATING
WITH MUHAMMAD.

1:32:12.699 --> 1:32:15.806
ALI IS
OUTSMARTING FRAZIER.

1:32:15.840 --> 1:32:19.775
FRAZIER CAN'T AFFORD TO
GIVE ANY MORE ROUNDS AWAY.

1:32:19.810 --> 1:32:23.710
FRAZIER JUST KEPT
COMING, ABSORBING ALI'S PUNCHES

1:32:23.745 --> 1:32:27.300
AS HE ATTEMPTED TO GET UNDER
ALI'S ARMS AND LAND HIS

1:32:27.334 --> 1:32:28.888
LETHAL LEFT HOOK.

1:32:28.922 --> 1:32:30.855
OH! GOT HIM THERE!

1:32:32.167 --> 1:32:36.102
WHAT WAS HOLDING
FRAZIER BACK WAS THE GHOSTS

1:32:36.136 --> 1:32:40.278
OF GETTING KNOCKED OUT BY
GEORGE FOREMAN A YEAR PRIOR.

1:32:40.313 --> 1:32:43.868
AND WHEN YOU'RE HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION AND YOU GO TO JAMAICA

1:32:43.903 --> 1:32:45.663
AND YOU END UP GETTING
KNOCKED OUT BY THIS GUY...

1:32:45.698 --> 1:32:46.802
DOWN GOES FRAZIER!

1:32:46.837 --> 1:32:49.322
IT MAKES YOU PLUMMET.

1:32:49.356 --> 1:32:51.704
THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU'LL NEVER FORGET.

1:32:51.738 --> 1:32:56.191
SO THIS JOE FRAZIER
AND THE ONE FROM '71,

1:32:56.225 --> 1:32:58.849
TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

1:32:58.883 --> 1:33:02.162
IF YOU'RE JOE FRAZIER,
EVERY TIME YOU GET HIT,

1:33:02.197 --> 1:33:04.855
LIKE A SOLID SHOT,

1:33:04.889 --> 1:33:07.996
YOU THINK ABOUT THE LAST TIME
YOU GOT KNOCKED OUT.

1:33:08.030 --> 1:33:12.690
IN ROUNDS 7 AND 8,
FRAZIER BROKE THROUGH,

1:33:12.725 --> 1:33:16.176
TAGGING ALI WITH SEVERAL
DEVASTATING PUNCHES,

1:33:16.211 --> 1:33:19.076
INCLUDING ONE THAT
SENT ALI TO THE ROPES

1:33:19.110 --> 1:33:22.182
AS THE BELL RANG TO SIGNAL
THE END OF THE 8th.

1:33:22.217 --> 1:33:25.220
OH!
GOT HIM, THAT HURT HIM.

1:33:25.254 --> 1:33:27.705
ALI'S FACE
IS GETTING PUFFY.

1:33:27.740 --> 1:33:30.881
THAT'S BY FAR THE
BEST ROUND FOR JOE FRAZIER.

1:33:30.915 --> 1:33:34.091
FRAZIER IS SO
CONFIDENT AT THIS POINT.

1:33:34.125 --> 1:33:38.095
IN THE 9th, HIS FACE
SWOLLEN FROM FRAZIER'S BLOWS

1:33:38.129 --> 1:33:42.133
AND HIS NOSE TRICKLING BLOOD,
ALI CONNECTED WITH 10 PUNCHES

1:33:42.168 --> 1:33:44.446
FOR EVERY ONE
LANDED BY FRAZIER,

1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:48.657
INSPIRING CHANTS OF "ALI!"
FROM THE ELECTRIFIED CROWD.

1:33:50.417 --> 1:33:53.731
THIS IS AS GOOD
AS THE LAST FIGHT.

1:33:53.766 --> 1:33:57.079
PLENTY OF EXCITEMENT AT
OLD MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.

1:33:58.736 --> 1:34:01.118
THIS IS THE LAST ROUND.

1:34:01.152 --> 1:34:04.017
THERE'S NO TOMORROW,
ONLY TONIGHT.

1:34:04.052 --> 1:34:07.262
THE BOUT COULD END
IN A DRAW.

1:34:07.296 --> 1:34:09.057
"YOU GOTTA
STOP HIM TO WIN!"

1:34:09.091 --> 1:34:12.854
DUNDEE SHOUTED AT ALI,
AS FRAZIER CHASED AFTER HIM,

1:34:12.888 --> 1:34:15.788
DESPERATELY LAUNCHING
LEFT HOOKS.

1:34:15.822 --> 1:34:17.962
YOU GOT TO
WIN THIS ROUND, CHAMP!

1:34:19.964 --> 1:34:22.104
TREMENDOUS LEFT HOOKS!

1:34:22.139 --> 1:34:25.383
FRAZIER'S TEEING OFF.

1:34:25.418 --> 1:34:28.939
NOW FRAZIER IS
GETTING CARELESS.

1:34:28.973 --> 1:34:31.976
THEY'RE PUTTING
EVERYTHING INTO THIS.

1:34:32.011 --> 1:34:35.497
NOW IT'S A BATTLE
FOR SURVIVAL.

1:34:35.531 --> 1:34:38.224
WHAT A FINISH!

1:34:52.894 --> 1:34:55.172
THERE IT IS.

1:34:55.206 --> 1:34:57.415
IT'S ALL OVER.

1:34:57.450 --> 1:35:00.349
THE JUDGES WILL HAVE THEIR
WORK CUT OUT FOR THEM.

1:35:00.384 --> 1:35:02.524
LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,

1:35:02.558 --> 1:35:06.804
MAY I HAVE YOUR
ATTENTION, PLEASE?

1:35:06.839 --> 1:35:11.498
HERE IS YOUR DECISION.

1:35:11.533 --> 1:35:19.541
THE WINNER BY UNANIMOUS
DECISION IS MUHAMMAD ALI!

1:35:23.441 --> 1:35:26.859
3 YEARS AFTER LOSING
THE "FIGHT OF THE CENTURY,"

1:35:26.893 --> 1:35:31.415
MUHAMMAD ALI HAD AVENGED
HIS LOSS TO JOE FRAZIER.

1:35:31.449 --> 1:35:34.901
HE'S NOT THE SAME
FIGHTER HE WAS AGAINST LISTON.

1:35:34.936 --> 1:35:37.179
HE'S NOT UNDEFEATED
ANYMORE BECAUSE FRAZIER

1:35:37.214 --> 1:35:39.319
ALREADY BEAT HIM.

1:35:39.354 --> 1:35:43.116
WE KNOW HE CAN BE HURT
BECAUSE NORTON BROKE HIS JAW.

1:35:43.151 --> 1:35:46.050
SO WHO IS THIS FIGHTER?

1:35:46.085 --> 1:35:49.053
THIS IS THE COMPELLING
PART OF ALI AS WELL,

1:35:49.088 --> 1:35:52.160
THE COMPETITOR WHO HAS
SOMETHING NEW FOR YOU

1:35:52.194 --> 1:35:55.370
TO SHOW YOU THAT THIS
IS A GREAT FIGHTER.

1:35:55.404 --> 1:36:00.340
THIS IS A GREAT MAN, AND HE
COULD ONLY DO THAT AGAINST

1:36:00.375 --> 1:36:02.308
SOMEBODY LIKE FRAZIER.

1:36:02.342 --> 1:36:06.070
YOU GOTTA HAVE REAL COMPETITION
TO PROVE YOUR GREATNESS.

1:36:07.347 --> 1:36:10.799
AFTER THE FIGHT,
FRAZIER ASSURED REPORTERS

1:36:10.834 --> 1:36:12.387
THAT HE WAS NOT FINISHED.

1:36:12.421 --> 1:36:16.494
"I WANT HIM AGAIN,"
HE TOLD THEM, "ONE MORE TIME."

1:36:16.529 --> 1:36:19.359
"I'M GONNA GIVE JOE
ANOTHER CHANCE," SAID ALI.

1:36:19.394 --> 1:36:21.361
"I'M NOT GONNA DUCK HIM."

1:36:21.396 --> 1:36:24.192
I THINK THIS FIGHT WAS MUCH
BETTER THAN THE FIRST FIGHT.

1:36:24.226 --> 1:36:27.229
YOU TALKIN' ABOUT
SUPER FIGHT NUMBER TWO--

1:36:27.264 --> 1:36:30.819
TWO FIGHTERS THAT ARE NOT
CHAMPIONS WHO PUNCHED
EACH OTHER TO DEATH.

1:36:30.854 --> 1:36:34.133
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY AGAIN
FOR THE SURPRISE OF ALL OF YOU,

1:36:34.167 --> 1:36:37.067
WE JUST PUT ON ANOTHER FIGHT
THAT CAN'T BE TOPPED BY NO

1:36:37.101 --> 1:36:39.414
HEAVYWEIGHT FIGHT IN HISTORY.

1:36:39.448 --> 1:36:43.280
PROMOTERS, WRITERS
AND FANS WERE EAGER TO SEE

1:36:43.314 --> 1:36:47.560
THE TWO EX-CHAMPIONS SQUARE OFF
IN A THIRD MATCH TO SETTLE THEIR

1:36:47.594 --> 1:36:50.321
RIVALRY ONCE AND FOR ALL.

1:36:50.356 --> 1:36:53.946
BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING,
ALI WANTED TO REGAIN

1:36:53.980 --> 1:36:56.017
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CROWN.

1:36:56.051 --> 1:36:59.537
TO DO THAT, HE WOULD NEED
TO DEFEAT THE CURRENT CHAMP

1:36:59.572 --> 1:37:01.505
GEORGE FOREMAN.

1:37:07.131 --> 1:37:10.997
GEORGE FOREMAN HAD PUT
THE FEAR OF GOD INTO PEOPLE

1:37:11.032 --> 1:37:17.348
IN BOXING CIRCLES
BECAUSE ALI FOUGHT FRAZIER,

1:37:17.383 --> 1:37:22.560
FRAZIER KNOCKED ALI DOWN
AND WON THE FIRST FIGHT,

1:37:22.595 --> 1:37:25.149
FRAZIER FOUGHT
GEORGE FOREMAN...

1:37:25.184 --> 1:37:26.599
FOREMAN IS
ALL OVER JOE FRAZIER.

1:37:26.633 --> 1:37:28.670
AND IN THE FIRST
2 ROUNDS OF THE FIGHT,

1:37:28.704 --> 1:37:30.361
GOT DEMOLISHED.

1:37:30.396 --> 1:37:33.123
IT IS OVER!
IT IS OVER IN
THE 2nd ROUND.

1:37:33.157 --> 1:37:37.161
GEORGE FOREMAN, NOT ONLY
WAS HE BEATING PEOPLE,

1:37:37.196 --> 1:37:39.508
HE WAS DESTROYING PEOPLE.

1:37:39.543 --> 1:37:43.271
HE WAS KNOCKING PEOPLE OUT
LIKE IT WAS NOTHING.

1:37:45.100 --> 1:37:49.104
25-YEAR-OLD
GEORGE FOREMAN STOOD 6'4"

1:37:49.139 --> 1:37:51.969
AND WEIGHED 225 POUNDS.

1:37:52.004 --> 1:37:56.042
HE HAD WON ALL 39 OF HIS
FIGHTS, 36 BY KNOCKOUT.

1:37:57.595 --> 1:37:59.183
RAISED
POOR AND HUNGRY

1:37:59.218 --> 1:38:01.254
IN A FLOOD-PRONE,
CRIME-RIDDEN SECTION

1:38:01.289 --> 1:38:04.395
OF HOUSTON KNOWN AS
"THE BLOODY FIFTH,"

1:38:04.430 --> 1:38:07.053
FOREMAN WAS FREQUENTLY
IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW

1:38:07.088 --> 1:38:09.987
BEFORE HE JOINED
THE JOB CORPS AT 16,

1:38:10.022 --> 1:38:13.094
WHERE HE GOT HIS GED,
TRAINED TO BE A CARPENTER

1:38:13.128 --> 1:38:16.200
AND A BRICKLAYER,
AND TOOK UP BOXING.

1:38:16.235 --> 1:38:19.134
I GOT A LOT OF WORK
TO DO BEFORE I TURN PRO,

1:38:19.169 --> 1:38:21.412
BUT WHEN I DO START,
I'M GOING ALL THE WAY UP.

1:38:21.447 --> 1:38:23.242
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY ALL THE WAY UP?

1:38:23.276 --> 1:38:25.554
ALL THE WAY UP TO
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

1:38:25.589 --> 1:38:27.522
OF THE WORLD, FOR REAL.

1:38:27.556 --> 1:38:31.698
BY 20, HE HAD WON
A GOLD MEDAL AT THE 1968

1:38:31.733 --> 1:38:34.529
MEXICO CITY OLYMPICS
AND TURNED PROFESSIONAL.

1:38:37.014 --> 1:38:39.154
THE WAY TO
BEAT FOREMAN, WROTE THE
SCOTTISH SPORTSWRITER

1:38:39.189 --> 1:38:42.192
HUGH McILVANNEY,
"INVOLVES SHELLING HIM

1:38:42.226 --> 1:38:46.679
FOR 3 DAYS AND THEN
SENDING IN THE INFANTRY."

1:38:46.713 --> 1:38:50.096
"HE'S NOT THE REAL CHAMP,"
SCOFFED ALI, WHO CALLED

1:38:50.131 --> 1:38:52.202
FOREMAN A "SISSY FIGHTER."

1:38:52.236 --> 1:38:54.480
"I'M THE REAL CHAMP."

1:38:59.554 --> 1:39:02.971
"THERE'LL BE A FIGHT WHEN
GEORGE FOREMAN TELLS US

1:39:03.006 --> 1:39:06.492
HE WANTS TO FIGHT," SAID ALI'S
PROMOTER AND ATTORNEY BOB ARUM,

1:39:06.526 --> 1:39:09.460
WHO BELIEVED THAT
IT WOULD TAKE $10 MILLION,

1:39:09.495 --> 1:39:13.085
$5 MILLION TO EACH BOXER,
TO GET THE MATCH MADE.

1:39:14.500 --> 1:39:17.641
BUT ARUM WAS NOT THE
ONLY PROMOTER WITH PLANS

1:39:17.675 --> 1:39:19.677
FOR MUHAMMAD ALI.

1:39:19.712 --> 1:39:23.095
DON KING HAD ONCE
RUN AN ILLEGAL NUMBERS GAME

1:39:23.129 --> 1:39:25.994
IN CLEVELAND, OHIO BEFORE
HE WAS FOUND GUILTY

1:39:26.029 --> 1:39:27.616
OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER

1:39:27.651 --> 1:39:30.378
FOR STOMPING A FORMER
ASSOCIATE TO DEATH

1:39:30.412 --> 1:39:36.108
OUTSIDE A BAR IN 1966
OVER AN UNPAID DEBT.

1:39:36.142 --> 1:39:39.559
WHEN THE JUDGE UNEXPECTEDLY
REDUCED HIS LIFE SENTENCE,

1:39:39.594 --> 1:39:44.392
KING ENDED UP SERVING LESS
THAN 4 YEARS IN PRISON.

1:39:44.426 --> 1:39:47.774
AFTER HIS RELEASE,
HE CONVINCED ALI TO BOX

1:39:47.809 --> 1:39:51.330
AT A BENEFIT FOR A FAILING
CLEVELAND HOSPITAL.

1:39:51.364 --> 1:39:54.609
THOUGH THEIR EFFORTS RAISED
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS,

1:39:54.643 --> 1:39:57.508
FOREST CITY HOSPITAL
SAW LITTLE OF IT

1:39:57.543 --> 1:40:00.580
AND CLOSED 5 YEARS LATER.

1:40:02.686 --> 1:40:06.310
BUT DON KING HAD
DISCOVERED HIS CALLING.

1:40:06.345 --> 1:40:08.105
I AM VERY HAPPY TO
BE A PART OF THIS,

1:40:08.140 --> 1:40:10.142
AND I AM AN
EXTRAORDINARY HUSTLER.

1:40:10.176 --> 1:40:13.628
SO THEREFORE, I FEEL THAT
I AM LIKENED TO ONLY 2 OR 3

1:40:13.662 --> 1:40:15.630
GIANT PROMOTERS IN THE LIFETIME
THAT WE HAVE LIVED IN,

1:40:15.664 --> 1:40:18.322
AND THAT'S P.T. BARNUM AND
MICHAEL TODD AND YOURS TRULY.

1:40:18.357 --> 1:40:22.533
LOUD AND BLUSTERY, DON
KING SPOKE IN RHYTHMIC TORRENTS,

1:40:22.568 --> 1:40:27.159
QUOTED SHAKESPEARE LIBERALLY,
AND KEPT HIS SAVINGS IN CASH,

1:40:27.193 --> 1:40:30.196
SO THAT THE WHITE MAN
COULD NOT TAKE HIS MONEY

1:40:30.231 --> 1:40:34.649
AND NO ONE COULD
FIND OUT HOW MUCH HE HAD.

1:40:34.683 --> 1:40:38.308
HE WAS PERSISTENT AND
PERSUASIVE, AND AS AN EMERGING

1:40:38.342 --> 1:40:41.311
BLACK PROMOTER IN A
WHITE-CONTROLLED PROFESSION,

1:40:41.345 --> 1:40:45.556
HE COULD OFFER A
POWERFUL MESSAGE TO THE
AFRICAN-AMERICAN BOXERS

1:40:45.591 --> 1:40:49.353
WHO DOMINATED THE SPORT--
THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THEM

1:40:49.388 --> 1:40:52.494
IN WAYS WHITE PROMOTERS
NEVER COULD.

1:40:52.529 --> 1:40:56.671
KING BOUGHT A STAKE IN SEVERAL
UP-AND-COMING HEAVYWEIGHTS,

1:40:56.705 --> 1:40:59.536
STAGED DRAMATIC
PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS,

1:40:59.570 --> 1:41:01.469
DOUBLE-CROSSED HIS PARTNERS,

1:41:01.503 --> 1:41:07.302
STIFFED THE BOXERS, AND DROPPED
THEM AS SOON AS THEY LOST.

1:41:07.337 --> 1:41:11.341
BUT BEFORE HE COULD
REPRESENT ALI, KING NEEDED TO

1:41:11.375 --> 1:41:14.792
GET APPROVAL FROM ELIJAH
MUHAMMAD, WHO HAD QUIETLY

1:41:14.827 --> 1:41:17.312
EMBRACED THE BOXER AGAIN.

1:41:17.347 --> 1:41:22.110
AT A MEETING IN CHICAGO,
KING ASKED THE NATION
OF ISLAM'S LEADER

1:41:22.145 --> 1:41:25.113
WHY HE ALLOWED
A WHITE MAN, BOB ARUM,

1:41:25.148 --> 1:41:27.598
TO PROMOTE ALI'S FIGHTS.

1:41:27.633 --> 1:41:31.878
DON KING ASSURED HIM THAT
HE COULD DO IT BETTER.

1:41:31.913 --> 1:41:36.435
EVEN THOUGH KING
REJECTED AN INVITATION TO
JOIN THE NATION OF ISLAM,

1:41:36.469 --> 1:41:40.887
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD GAVE
THE PROMOTER HIS BLESSING.

1:41:40.922 --> 1:41:45.271
KING'S PITCH WITH EVERY
BLACK ATHLETE WAS, "DON'T DO

1:41:45.306 --> 1:41:48.309
"BUSINESS WITH THE JEW,
DO BUSINESS WITH ME.

1:41:48.343 --> 1:41:50.449
I'M THE SAME KIND AS YOU."

1:41:51.829 --> 1:41:55.316
DON KING TOLD ALI
AND HERBERT MUHAMMAD THAT HE

1:41:55.350 --> 1:41:59.699
WOULD GET ALI AND GEORGE
FOREMAN $5 MILLION EACH--

1:41:59.734 --> 1:42:04.394
TWICE WHAT ALI AND FRAZIER
MADE IN THEIR TITLE FIGHT.

1:42:04.428 --> 1:42:08.639
KING PROMISED ALI AN ADVANCE
AND AGREED THAT IF HE FAILED

1:42:08.674 --> 1:42:12.540
TO MAKE ANY OF THE SUBSEQUENT
PAYMENTS, ALI COULD WALK AWAY

1:42:12.574 --> 1:42:16.302
AND KEEP WHATEVER HE'D
ALREADY BEEN PAID.

1:42:16.337 --> 1:42:19.926
AND, HERBERT CAME TO ME
AND SAID, "WHAT SHOULD HE DO?"

1:42:19.961 --> 1:42:22.274
I SAID, "GET A DOWN PAYMENT,
TAKE THE MONEY,

1:42:22.308 --> 1:42:24.172
"AND IT'S EASY MONEY.

1:42:24.207 --> 1:42:26.761
"YOU'LL--YOU'LL GET THE
DOWN PAYMENT AND WALK AWAY.

1:42:26.795 --> 1:42:29.695
NO WAY HE'S GONNA
GET THE MONEY."

1:42:29.729 --> 1:42:32.870
"THIS ISN'T JUST
ANOTHER FIGHT," KING TOLD ALI.

1:42:32.905 --> 1:42:34.838
"FREEDOM. JUSTICE.

1:42:34.872 --> 1:42:37.461
"THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL BE GAINING
FOR YOUR PEOPLE BY GETTING

1:42:37.496 --> 1:42:39.256
THE TITLE BACK."

1:42:40.740 --> 1:42:45.952
ON FEBRUARY 14, 1974,
KING FLEW TO CALIFORNIA,

1:42:45.987 --> 1:42:48.645
WHERE GEORGE FOREMAN WAS
TRAINING FOR AN UPCOMING

1:42:48.679 --> 1:42:50.854
BOUT WITH KEN NORTON.

1:42:50.888 --> 1:42:53.857
THE PROMOTER CORNERED THE
CHAMPION IN THE PARKING LOT

1:42:53.891 --> 1:42:55.686
OF HIS HOTEL.

1:42:55.721 --> 1:42:59.552
RECENTLY DIVORCED,
HIS FINANCES IN DISARRAY AFTER

1:42:59.587 --> 1:43:02.762
HEEDING THE SHABBY ADVICE OF
HIS HANDLERS, AND UNABLE TO

1:43:02.797 --> 1:43:06.628
FIGHT IN THE U.S. DUE TO LIENS
ON HIS EARNINGS, FOREMAN WAS

1:43:06.663 --> 1:43:08.665
IN A FOUL MOOD.

1:43:08.699 --> 1:43:13.394
THE MEN PACED THE LOT FOR TWO
HOURS AS KING MADE HIS PITCH.

1:43:13.428 --> 1:43:17.018
"I KNOW PEOPLE BEEN SCREWIN'
YOU," KING TOLD THE CHAMP,

1:43:17.052 --> 1:43:20.746
"BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
A CHANCE TO MAKE $5 MILLION."

1:43:20.780 --> 1:43:25.647
KING ALSO PROMISED FOREMAN
HE COULD DELIVER ALI.

1:43:25.682 --> 1:43:29.341
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT
FOR GEORGE FOREMAN.

1:43:29.375 --> 1:43:32.482
WHEN I WENT TO GEORGE FOREMAN
AND I PRESENTED THAT

1:43:32.516 --> 1:43:36.037
ALI WAS MY FRIEND AND THAT
I COULD DELIVER HIM, YOU KNOW,

1:43:36.071 --> 1:43:41.353
HE SAY, "WHAT CAN I WIN
BEATING UP AN OLD MAN?"

1:43:41.387 --> 1:43:44.632
HE SAYS, "IF I HURT HIM,
EVERYBODY GONNA LOOK AT ME

1:43:44.666 --> 1:43:47.359
"WITH DISDAIN BECAUSE
THE PEOPLE LOVE HIM.

1:43:47.393 --> 1:43:50.879
AND BESIDES THAT,
HE TALKS TOO MUCH."

1:43:50.914 --> 1:43:53.779
AND I SAY, "THAT'S IT,
GEORGE. THAT'S IT.

1:43:53.813 --> 1:43:56.575
"I HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU THERE.
SHUT HIS MOUTH."

1:43:58.301 --> 1:44:00.303
"THIS IS MY
PROMOTION," SAID KING,

1:44:00.337 --> 1:44:02.891
POINTING TO THE
SKIN ON HIS ARM.

1:44:02.926 --> 1:44:06.309
"I'M GIVING YOU MY TRUST,"
FOREMAN TOLD HIM.

1:44:06.343 --> 1:44:08.656
"YOU GOT THE FIGHT."

1:44:08.690 --> 1:44:14.006
BEFORE PARTING WAYS, KING HAD
FOREMAN SIGN 3 BLANK PAGES,

1:44:14.040 --> 1:44:18.079
PROMISING HE WOULD FILL IN THE
DETAILS LATER AND THEN SEND

1:44:18.113 --> 1:44:21.047
THE AGREEMENT TO
FOREMAN'S LAWYER.

1:44:21.082 --> 1:44:23.291
GEORGE HITS MUCH
HARDER THAN I DO.

1:44:23.326 --> 1:44:27.847
ON MARCH 26,
1974, MUHAMMAD ALI SAT

1:44:27.882 --> 1:44:32.921
RINGSIDE IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA
AS FOREMAN STOPPED KEN NORTON

1:44:32.956 --> 1:44:35.924
2 MINUTES INTO ROUND 2.

1:44:35.959 --> 1:44:38.996
I'M SURE THAT WHEN
I MEET GEORGE FOREMAN,

1:44:39.031 --> 1:44:41.965
THIS IS GONNA BE
A TOUGH FIGHT,

1:44:41.999 --> 1:44:44.588
BUT I'M SURE AND CONFIDENT
AFTER WATCHING THIS THAT

1:44:44.623 --> 1:44:46.728
I'LL BE THE NEXT WORLD
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION.

1:44:46.763 --> 1:44:49.835
WILL YOU BE FIGHTING HIM
IN AFRICA IN SEPTEMBER
AS REPORTED?

1:44:49.869 --> 1:44:52.355
YES, I'M GONNA FIGHT HIM
IN A PLACE WHERE YOU
CAN'T COME.

1:44:52.389 --> 1:44:54.011
HOWARD, I'M GONNA
FIGHT HIM IN THE CONGO

1:44:54.046 --> 1:44:55.875
WHERE
THE LUMUMBA BOYS ARE.

1:44:55.910 --> 1:44:59.362
AND IF YOU COME OVER THERE
AGITATIN', YOU'LL GET COOKED!

1:44:59.396 --> 1:45:02.917
IN THE WEEKS
SINCE ALI AND FOREMAN
HAD SIGNED WITH KING,

1:45:02.951 --> 1:45:05.885
THE PROMOTER HAD CHASED
FINANCING FROM WALL STREET

1:45:05.920 --> 1:45:11.374
TO DALLAS TO MADISON SQUARE
GARDEN AND EVENTUALLY TO PARIS,

1:45:11.408 --> 1:45:13.030
WHERE HE CONVINCED
REPRESENTATIVES

1:45:13.065 --> 1:45:16.517
OF THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE,
A FORMER BELGIAN COLONY

1:45:16.551 --> 1:45:20.659
IN CENTRAL AFRICA,
TO BACK THE FIGHT.

1:45:20.693 --> 1:45:24.145
ON THE FLIGHT HOME FROM
CARACAS, MUHAMMAD ALI HAD

1:45:24.179 --> 1:45:27.976
QUIZZED THE FORMER HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION JOE LOUIS.

1:45:28.011 --> 1:45:31.532
"DID YOU EVER CHOP WOOD WHEN YOU
WERE IN TRAINING?" HE ASKED.

1:45:31.566 --> 1:45:34.638
"ALL THE TIME,"
RESPONDED LOUIS.

1:45:34.673 --> 1:45:39.022
"I THINK I'LL CHOP SOME BEFORE
THE FOREMAN FIGHT," SAID ALI.

1:45:39.056 --> 1:45:43.060
"BETTER CHOP A LOT,"
LOUIS ADVISED.

1:46:22.583 --> 1:46:24.654
OH, YEAH

1:46:30.867 --> 1:46:32.696
AW, YEAH

1:46:32.731 --> 1:46:34.974
GET DOWN WITH IT

1:47:10.838 --> 1:47:13.634
BA DUM DUM DUM

1:47:19.916 --> 1:47:22.056
AH, YEAH

1:47:22.090 --> 1:47:23.920
TELL ME BABY

1:47:23.954 --> 1:47:26.060
WHAT'S MY NAME?

1:47:26.094 --> 1:47:28.131
TELL ME, HONEY

1:47:28.165 --> 1:47:30.098
CAN YOU GUESS MY NAME?

1:47:30.133 --> 1:47:32.204
TELL ME, BABY

1:47:32.238 --> 1:47:34.240
WHAT'S MY NAME?

1:47:34.275 --> 1:47:36.484
I TELL YOU ONE TIME

1:47:36.519 --> 1:47:38.072
YOU'RE TO BLAME

1:47:38.106 --> 1:47:40.557
UH-HUH

1:47:59.542 --> 1:48:04.098
OOH OOH
