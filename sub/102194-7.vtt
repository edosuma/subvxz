- We would love to hang out
with you, Sandra.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.420
'Cause you're so cool.
- No.

09:11.463 --> 09:13.509
- Really? Please?
I'm begging you.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.729
- Kay, try cash.
- Yeah, okay. I'll pay you.

09:15.772 --> 09:18.470
Double? Triple. Quadruple.
Whatever it takes.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.037
Please. Please take my baby.

09:20.081 --> 09:21.517
You're the best.
- What?

09:21.561 --> 09:22.953
- She's the sweetest thing
in the world.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.955
Watch out,
she does bite sometimes.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.740
Don't drop her. Food, water.
- I've--

09:28.872 --> 09:30.047
Hello.

09:33.181 --> 09:34.617
- So sorry.
I'm sure this isn't

09:34.661 --> 09:39.622
how you imagined spending
your first day in America.

09:39.666 --> 09:43.147
But I-I have a patient
who's in rough shape

09:43.191 --> 09:45.410
so if you need me,
I'll be in the Oncology--

09:45.454 --> 09:48.718
-
- What's--what's funny?

09:49.806 --> 09:52.722
- I'm sorry.

09:52.766 --> 09:53.723
It's just like watching

09:53.767 --> 09:56.204
Dr. Helen on TV.
- Ah.

09:56.247 --> 09:59.207
- My father would watch you
sometimes, and...

09:59.250 --> 10:01.688
he'd say,
"Look, that's your Ammeh."

10:01.731 --> 10:03.385
But it just felt so odd.

10:03.428 --> 10:06.083
Like if he said my Amoo was

10:06.127 --> 10:08.129
Ryan Seacrest or something.

10:10.044 --> 10:13.003
- Uh, well. Look, if, um,

10:13.047 --> 10:16.528
if it feels odd,

10:16.572 --> 10:19.706
calling me "ammeh," then, um,

10:19.749 --> 10:21.272
p-please don't.

10:21.316 --> 10:22.578
- But that would be
disrespectful.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.841
- No, no, no.
No, I'm asking you to.

10:24.885 --> 10:27.061
Um, I should be more like your

10:27.104 --> 10:30.020
big sister or your friend.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.588
Your friend Helen.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.894
That's what you should call me.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.939
Just Helen.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.506
- "Just Helen,"

10:37.549 --> 10:40.727
I know it's rude to be
so direct,

10:40.770 --> 10:43.077
but can I get some tea?

10:43.120 --> 10:45.296
- Oh, yes.

10:45.340 --> 10:48.560
Um, course.
You don't even have to ask.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.780
The cafeteria's on
the fourth floor.

10:50.824 --> 10:53.087
- Cool.
- Yeah.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.915
It is cool.

10:54.958 --> 10:58.440
- Hi, yes, I am in
desperate need of a nanny,

10:58.483 --> 11:00.398
and I heard you guys
are the best agency around.

11:00.442 --> 11:01.922
No, thank <i>you.</i>

11:01.965 --> 11:03.924
Well, I'm looking for
someone in the mid-town area.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.753
Uh, let's see,
teaching experience is a must.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.145
Bilingual is great.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.191
Trilingual is better.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.541
Uh, what else?
CPR certified, obviously.

11:12.584 --> 11:15.283
And, uh, oh!
Like a wizard with vegetables.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.938
I mean an actual wizard.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.376
Great.

11:21.419 --> 11:22.769
Oh, that's great.
Yeah, that's amazing.

11:22.812 --> 11:26.294
Um, um, starting tomorrow,
if you have it.

11:29.123 --> 11:32.126
What--when you say
"ten-month waiting list,"

11:32.169 --> 11:36.217
do you mean actual months
or is that a figure of speech?

11:38.654 --> 11:39.699
- Yeah?

11:39.742 --> 11:41.483
- I'm gonna have to
call you back.

11:41.526 --> 11:44.616
Hi, are you Howie Cournemeyer?

11:44.660 --> 11:46.444
- Yeah.
- I'm Max Goodwin,

11:46.488 --> 11:48.011
medical director
at New Amsterdam.

11:48.055 --> 11:51.275
- I knew you bastards
would come for me one day.

11:55.366 --> 11:56.585
- I walk in this morning
with HIV,

11:56.628 --> 11:58.282
and now I have cancer, too?

11:58.326 --> 12:00.284
I mean this can't be happening.
I can't even pronounce it.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.199
- Hemangiosarcoma.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.766
And we don't know for certain
that's what you have.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.420
- Okay, then
what do you think I do?

12:05.463 --> 12:07.161
I mean, you just found a lump.
That could be anything, right?

12:07.204 --> 12:11.339
- Hemangiosarcoma often occurs
when HIV goes undertreated.

12:11.382 --> 12:14.472
We won't know anything
for sure until your MRI.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.605
- HIV is not supposed to be
a big deal anymore.

12:16.648 --> 12:17.954
I mean, I've been on
my cocktail for years

12:17.998 --> 12:19.782
and I've been fine.
Now I miss a few check-ups

12:19.826 --> 12:23.351
and I might die?
-Let's not jump to conclusions.

12:25.962 --> 12:27.834
Oh, my God, what's happening?

12:27.877 --> 12:29.879
- Okay, can somebody
help please?

12:29.923 --> 12:31.707
Get her to the E.D.!

12:35.450 --> 12:36.712
- He's back. No pulse.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.192
They found him
in a parking lot.

12:38.235 --> 12:39.541
- V-TACH. Charging at 360.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.282
- Shockable rhythm present.

12:44.415 --> 12:45.590
Clear.
- Clear.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.027
- Shocking.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.292
- Screen for

12:51.335 --> 12:53.729
- Airway is patent.

12:53.773 --> 12:54.861
- He's back.

12:54.904 --> 12:57.211
Normal sinus rhythm.
- Pulse ox, 97.

12:57.254 --> 12:59.082
- Kwame.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.736
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey!
- Are you all right?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.694
- No, out. You need to be out.
- I'm responsible for him.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.000
- You don't have a mask!
- I'm the president of

13:04.044 --> 13:05.306
his mission for
the Church of Jesus Christ.

13:05.349 --> 13:08.309
- Elder Shumway.
- It's gonna be okay.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.614
I'm here.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.399
- I'll get the lidocaine
drip ready.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.574
- Tell me what happened.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.014
- I can't.

13:18.058 --> 13:20.887
- You can tell me anything.

13:20.930 --> 13:21.931
Remember?

13:24.107 --> 13:25.326
- I was...

13:28.895 --> 13:31.288
with a man.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.557
I have HIV.

13:45.085 --> 13:47.565
Please don't send me back.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.045
I want to finish my mission.

13:49.089 --> 13:52.614
The Church is all I have.
God is all I have.

13:52.657 --> 13:55.356
- Then why did you
turn your back on Him?

13:57.532 --> 13:59.012
Your mission is over.

14:01.971 --> 14:04.887
- Elder Shumway, please.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.368
Please! Please.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.674
-
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

14:12.329 --> 14:14.984
- Vijay! Oh, hey.

14:18.466 --> 14:21.251
What's up? What's wrong?

14:21.295 --> 14:23.079
- He's not coming.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.603
- No, I don't know. He probably
just forgot his glasses

14:25.647 --> 14:27.214
and he headed back
to get them--

14:27.257 --> 14:29.346
- I just got an email.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.696
The whole neurology
department did.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.873
Dr. Kapoor just resigned.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.662
He's not coming back.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.535
Ever.

14:57.026 --> 14:59.159
- Okay, here's what
I think is happening.

14:59.202 --> 14:59.942
I think
you're embarrassed because

14:59.986 --> 15:01.683
you and I talk every day.

15:01.726 --> 15:04.599
And now you're worried
that I'm gonna be mad

15:04.642 --> 15:07.080
because you've been lying to me
literally the entire time.

15:07.123 --> 15:08.820
But I'm not. I'm not mad.

15:08.864 --> 15:10.518
I know that you have
one of those

15:10.561 --> 15:13.303
ancient answering machines
that you can actually hear me

15:13.347 --> 15:14.826
leaving a message for you
right now.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.828
You can hear me talking.
So just pick up.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.265
I'm not mad,
I swear I'm not mad.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.182
Okay, you know what?
I am mad.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.010
I'm pissed.
I'm furious with you

15:24.053 --> 15:25.620
because I'm your best friend.

15:25.663 --> 15:27.535
You told the entire
neurology department

15:27.578 --> 15:29.537
that you were resigning
before you told me.

15:29.580 --> 15:30.755
Y-you still haven't told me

15:30.799 --> 15:33.062
because you won't
pick up the phone!

15:33.106 --> 15:34.672
Pick up the phone, Vijay!

15:36.152 --> 15:38.241
Do you want to know
where I was when

15:38.285 --> 15:39.547
I heard your
little announcement?

15:39.590 --> 15:42.376
I was at your surprise party.
Surprise!

15:42.419 --> 15:44.160
I planned you a party
that you didn't show up to.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.336
And you know, I don't--
I don't deserve this.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.990
Vijay, I do not deserve this.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.297
Unless I'm just your
deluded work friend

15:50.340 --> 15:52.342
who's been putting himself
on for years.

15:52.386 --> 15:53.691
In that case, by all means--

15:53.735 --> 15:55.041
Oh, n--

16:01.786 --> 16:04.180
Oops. I forgot yours.

16:04.224 --> 16:07.053
- Um, Mr. Cournemeyer.

16:07.096 --> 16:08.315
Howie, listen--

16:08.358 --> 16:10.012
- No, you listen.
I'm not scared of you.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.014
I knew what I was doing
was against the law.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.276
That was the point.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.104
You're way too young
to remember any of this.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.367
But back in the '80s,
at the height of AIDS?

16:17.411 --> 16:19.369
The healthcare industry
failed its patients.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.893
New Amsterdam
failed its patients.

16:21.937 --> 16:23.504
Gay men
were treated like lepers.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.985
Your nurses wouldn't even touch
friends of mine with AIDS.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.899
Just left them alone
in the corners to die.

16:27.943 --> 16:29.379
- Let me assure you--

16:29.423 --> 16:31.338
- Big pharma?
Boy, do not get me started--

16:31.381 --> 16:32.817
- I think that train's
left the station.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.558
- Big pharma profiteered

16:34.602 --> 16:37.257
off the gay community's
desperation to survive.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.607
So I decided to fight
on behalf of those who had it.

16:39.650 --> 16:42.305
I became an activist.
Then I joined ACT UP.

16:42.349 --> 16:43.741
And we did what we had to do.

16:43.785 --> 16:46.005
To make things right,
to make some noise.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.745
And, so, yeah.

16:47.789 --> 16:50.052
That's why I stole
the New Amsterdam seal.

16:50.096 --> 16:53.012
And why I encased it
in a gigantic condom.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.057
And no,
I will never give it back.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.235
- Wow, that's, uh,

16:59.279 --> 17:00.976
impressive, actually.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.760
But not why I'm here.

17:02.804 --> 17:04.110
- No.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.982
Not for the...big condom.

17:08.810 --> 17:13.293
- Uh, Mr. Cournemeyer,
I came here to ask you

17:13.336 --> 17:14.598
how,

17:14.642 --> 17:17.166
in March of '86,
you orchestrated a scheme

17:17.210 --> 17:20.213
to donate a thousand pints
of blood under your name?

17:20.256 --> 17:22.345
- What?
I would never have

17:22.389 --> 17:25.740
donated a single drop
of my blood to your hospital,

17:25.783 --> 17:26.915
even to make a point.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.308
- But then why is your name--

17:28.351 --> 17:32.138
- Come to think of it,
March of '86, I was in jail.

17:32.181 --> 17:36.055
I demanded a coordinated
national policy to fight AIDS

17:36.098 --> 17:38.448
by chaining myself
to the Statehouse doors.

17:38.492 --> 17:39.971
They heard me.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.190
- In jail.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.149
- Wrong guy, Doc.

17:46.543 --> 17:47.414
- Esophageal?

17:47.457 --> 17:49.764
- No negative interactions.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.332
- I'm thinking
variceal bleeding,

17:52.375 --> 17:53.811
likely from liver cancer.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.467
BP's dropping.
Have you got that tube in yet?

17:57.511 --> 17:59.295
- I'm trying.
- STEMI ruled out at this time.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.645
- Looks a bit more distal.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.386
- About 2 centimeters
should do it.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.867
Right...

18:05.910 --> 18:08.565
there.
- Got it?

18:08.609 --> 18:10.089
- I think so.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.265
We should know
once the bleeding stops.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.005
- It's good for now.

18:14.049 --> 18:17.008
Fingers crossed that it holds.

18:17.052 --> 18:19.750
- How did she let herself
get so bad?

18:19.794 --> 18:22.492
- Because apparently
"HIV isn't scary anymore."

18:22.536 --> 18:25.713
- Yeah, I guess some people
need to be scared.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.631
- Have a seat.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.811
I can't tell you about faith.

18:36.854 --> 18:39.030
But I saw what your Elder did.

18:39.074 --> 18:41.685
You shouldn't have to repent
to someone who abandoned you

18:41.729 --> 18:44.514
at a time when
you needed him the most.

18:44.558 --> 18:48.301
- Elder Shumway
loves me like a father.

18:48.344 --> 18:51.086
He knew I was gay.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.437
He treated me with grace
and acceptance.

18:54.481 --> 18:57.571
All he asked of me was
to not act on my desires.

18:58.876 --> 19:01.705
He did not turn his back.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.707
I did.

19:03.751 --> 19:06.884
I threw God away.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.539
And this disease,

19:09.583 --> 19:12.542
it means I will never
get God back.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.725
Is there a pill?

19:21.769 --> 19:22.900
A surgery?

19:22.944 --> 19:24.598
Anything to scrape these

19:24.641 --> 19:26.208
disgusting urges
out of my body?

19:26.252 --> 19:27.731
- Kwame, Kwame.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.300
Brother,
this is not disgusting.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.781
This is who you are.

19:37.741 --> 19:40.701
Sex is not who I am.

19:40.744 --> 19:43.094
I am my community.

19:43.138 --> 19:44.966
My family, my faith.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.446
I am an Elder

19:46.489 --> 19:50.189
in the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-Day Saints.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.016
That is who I am.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.410
- That is not that simple.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.760
- But it is that simple.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.501
Think of the one thing

19:58.545 --> 20:00.764
you can't live without.

20:05.987 --> 20:08.468
That is who you are.

20:13.429 --> 20:15.039
- Well, so I gave it
some thought,

20:15.083 --> 20:16.345
and I realized I was being

20:16.389 --> 20:18.260
way too stringent with
the nanny requirements,

20:18.304 --> 20:20.044
so here's what
I'm looking for now.

20:20.088 --> 20:23.613
Anyone. I will take anyone.
Do you--do you have anyone?

20:23.657 --> 20:25.441
Dr. Val!
Ma'am, I will take

20:25.485 --> 20:27.400
a well-trained Saint Bernard
at this point.

20:27.443 --> 20:28.705
Okay, thank you very much.

20:28.749 --> 20:31.317
So Howie couldn't really
shed any light.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.102
He did have
a giant condom situation.

20:34.145 --> 20:35.451
Not really sure what
that's about,

20:35.495 --> 20:36.974
but I'll deal with that
tomorrow.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.280
- Makes sense.
- Does it?

20:38.324 --> 20:40.326
I need to track down the head

20:40.369 --> 20:43.242
of the blood bank from 1986,
and problem is,

20:43.285 --> 20:45.331
his information
on his W-2 is outdated,

20:45.374 --> 20:47.158
so I was wondering if you
could ask the older staff.

20:47.202 --> 20:48.377
Maybe they know him?

20:48.421 --> 20:49.857
- Oh, yeah, sure thing.
What's the name?

20:49.900 --> 20:51.598
- Uh, Dale Rustin.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.469
- You sure?
- Yeah, why? You know him?

20:53.513 --> 20:55.732
- No, but the whole blood
bank's been talking about him.

20:55.776 --> 20:58.257
He's upstairs.
- He still works here?

20:58.300 --> 21:00.389
- No, he's a patient.
He's dying.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.527
- I'm sorry about
that last phone call.

21:07.570 --> 21:10.356
Um, I didn't mean to
dump all that on you.

21:13.359 --> 21:16.275
I love you,
and I hope that you are okay.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.628
But I gotta draw
a boundary here, Vijay.

21:24.892 --> 21:28.025
You need to pick up the phone,
right now,

21:28.069 --> 21:33.509
or you and I can't ever be

21:33.553 --> 21:36.469
the same kind of friends
anymore.

21:36.512 --> 21:37.644
At all, really.

21:44.912 --> 21:46.783
So pick up the phone.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.749
Pick up the phone, Vijay.

22:13.244 --> 22:17.031
- Stage III Astrocytoma.

22:18.467 --> 22:19.903
I'm sorry to hear that.

22:22.210 --> 22:25.344
"New Amsterdam.
Shame then, shame now."

22:27.128 --> 22:30.261
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

22:33.439 --> 22:38.705
- I had worse things to say
about Medical Director Helms,

22:38.748 --> 22:41.838
but kids do use that hallway.

22:41.882 --> 22:44.363
- Dr. Helms is a pillar
of this hospital.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.454
- So you don't want to
explain yourself?

22:48.497 --> 22:50.194
You just want to
slander him anonymously?

22:50.238 --> 22:52.893
- I'd slander him to his face

22:52.936 --> 22:55.548
if I thought anybody
would care.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.941
- Try me.

23:00.422 --> 23:05.558
- In 1986,
this hospital needed blood.

23:05.601 --> 23:08.038
As so many did.

23:11.477 --> 23:15.263
But sexually active gay men

23:15.306 --> 23:18.179
were banned from donating it
in this country,

23:18.222 --> 23:22.531
even if they knew they were
HIV-negative.

23:22.575 --> 23:23.880
- That's not Helms' fault.

23:23.924 --> 23:25.969
It's...

23:26.013 --> 23:27.101
it's the way
the world was then.

23:27.144 --> 23:29.233
- Gay men can't donate

23:29.277 --> 23:33.412
convalescent plasma
for COVID right now.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.414
So you tell me,

23:35.457 --> 23:38.373
what exactly changed?

23:40.636 --> 23:42.072
I'm fine.

23:45.989 --> 23:51.038
I was a gay HIV-negative man.

23:51.081 --> 23:53.170
My friends were dying.

23:55.825 --> 23:57.914
They needed blood.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.310
I couldn't donate.

24:05.226 --> 24:09.360
I was the head of
the damn blood bank.

24:11.275 --> 24:15.323
You know what that feels like?

24:15.366 --> 24:18.805
A person has to do something.

24:18.848 --> 24:21.329
Has to act.

24:22.722 --> 24:24.637
- Like Howie Cournemeyer?

24:30.860 --> 24:33.384
Howie was fearless.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.169
I never met him,

24:35.212 --> 24:40.522
but God, was he inspiring.

24:40.566 --> 24:43.786
He made it so simple.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.963
Just do something.

24:47.007 --> 24:49.662
Act up.

24:49.705 --> 24:51.533
And I did.

24:55.494 --> 24:59.280
- You had gay men
hide their identities

24:59.323 --> 25:01.630
and donate

25:01.674 --> 25:03.632
using Howie's name.

25:05.025 --> 25:07.767
- That's the best thing to do
in a plague.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.899
Give.

25:09.943 --> 25:12.554
Help.

25:12.598 --> 25:16.558
I got to see scared men
going from

25:16.602 --> 25:19.822
helpless to heroes,

25:19.866 --> 25:22.651
drop by drop.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.960
Until...

25:27.003 --> 25:29.136
- Helms found out.

25:29.179 --> 25:31.965
- He said he'd fire me.

25:32.008 --> 25:35.011
My staff too.

25:35.055 --> 25:38.885
Howie Cournemeyer
would have kept fighting,

25:38.928 --> 25:41.670
but I needed my job.

25:41.714 --> 25:44.020
So I shut the program down.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.156
And that's something
I have to live with

25:49.199 --> 25:51.288
for the rest of my life.

25:59.166 --> 26:01.211
- You refilled this hospital's
blood bank

26:01.255 --> 26:05.389
in under a month
during a pandemic.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.611
You're a hero.

26:09.655 --> 26:13.615
- Yet you honor the man
that made me a coward.

26:16.662 --> 26:20.622
The world is burning,
Dr. Goodwin.

26:24.147 --> 26:27.107
And you spend your day
hunting me down

26:27.150 --> 26:29.718
for defacing a photograph?

26:32.329 --> 26:36.986
Shame then, shame now.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.081
- You came back.

26:49.172 --> 26:51.044
- Reynolds?

26:52.698 --> 26:54.656
What was that?

26:54.700 --> 26:57.137
- What Kwame wants
more than anything

26:57.180 --> 27:00.009
is to be a Mormon husband
to a Mormon wife,

27:00.053 --> 27:01.620
and he thought he lost that.

27:01.663 --> 27:03.404
- He has lost that.
He's gay.

27:03.447 --> 27:05.319
- No, no.
He thought he lost that

27:05.362 --> 27:07.321
because he's HIV-positive,

27:07.364 --> 27:09.715
and he thought that meant
that he couldn't have children.

27:09.758 --> 27:12.935
Which is the cornerstone
of his spiritual community.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.894
- Gay people can have children.

27:14.937 --> 27:18.375
- But between HART therapy
and PrEP, of course,

27:18.419 --> 27:21.074
HIV can be untransmittable
and safe for conception.

27:21.117 --> 27:23.554
So I called the Elder,
let him know that,

27:23.598 --> 27:25.644
and he feels
there's a path for Kwame.

27:25.687 --> 27:28.037
He even suggested
that he can marry a woman

27:28.081 --> 27:30.083
who knows about his struggles.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.695
- Are you kidding me?

27:33.739 --> 27:35.479
You used the science of HIV

27:35.523 --> 27:38.439
to put someone
back into the closet.

27:38.482 --> 27:40.702
- Well, that's--
that's what he wants.

27:40.746 --> 27:43.444
- So if he wanted to shoot
himself in the head,

27:43.487 --> 27:45.228
where would you have
stood on that?

27:45.272 --> 27:47.317
- What if he wanted to leave
the E.D.

27:47.361 --> 27:48.841
with a failing pancreas?

27:48.884 --> 27:51.234
You think I like this?
I don't.

27:51.278 --> 27:53.846
But we can't pick and choose
when to respect

27:53.889 --> 27:55.195
our patient's wishes.

27:55.238 --> 27:58.024
And being a Mormon
is more important to Kwame

27:58.067 --> 27:59.503
than his sexuality.

27:59.547 --> 28:01.549
- Well, the guy he had
unprotected sex with

28:01.592 --> 28:03.551
disagrees with you.
- Oh, come on.

28:03.594 --> 28:05.858
Nobody's torturing him.
He's choosing this.

28:05.901 --> 28:06.946
- Yes.

28:06.989 --> 28:09.339
Yeah, he is choosing a life

28:09.383 --> 28:11.472
based on the idea
that he has to

28:11.515 --> 28:13.996
be somebody that he's not.

28:14.040 --> 28:17.217
Because there's something wrong
with who he is.

28:17.260 --> 28:20.046
Look, I get what you were
trying to do here, Floyd,

28:20.089 --> 28:23.353
but we're talking about
his heart.

28:39.195 --> 28:41.154
- Well, hello there.

28:41.197 --> 28:44.592
So, I noticed that
you went out earlier.

28:44.635 --> 28:47.334
- Yes. With Kevin.
He's my old friend.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.553
- Your old friend?
- Yes.

28:49.597 --> 28:51.164
You've been in New York
five hours,

28:51.207 --> 28:52.382
and you've got an old friend?

28:52.426 --> 28:53.514
- He's a friend
from the internet.

28:53.557 --> 28:55.255
From when we were kids.

28:55.298 --> 28:57.692
- I see. And he's, um,

28:57.736 --> 28:59.650
how old?

28:59.694 --> 29:02.436
- I'm not sure.
Can I go to your office now?

29:02.479 --> 29:05.787
- Mina.
Did you get my texts?

29:05.831 --> 29:07.615
- I was busy.

29:07.658 --> 29:09.138
- Busy.

29:09.182 --> 29:10.792
- Is there a problem?

29:10.836 --> 29:13.229
I thought you said to
treat you like a friend.

29:13.273 --> 29:14.622
- Yep, absolutely.

29:14.665 --> 29:17.016
- And I didn't text
any of my friends

29:17.059 --> 29:18.713
to tell them that I was
hanging out with Kevin.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.367
- Yes, no, of course.
It's just, um,

29:20.410 --> 29:22.499
you've never
been to New York before.

29:22.543 --> 29:25.459
- Oh, it's a lot like Tehran,
just a little less crowded.

29:25.502 --> 29:27.591
I'll see you when you're done?

29:33.032 --> 29:35.469
- Max, you wanted to see me.

29:35.512 --> 29:37.471
- Hey, George.
I, uh...

29:39.690 --> 29:41.692
I heard about
Howie Cournemeyer.

29:45.479 --> 29:49.222
- Oh, I know how that looks.

29:49.265 --> 29:51.790
If I let that continue
for one more day,

29:51.833 --> 29:55.532
it would have been
an unmitigated disaster.

29:55.576 --> 30:00.320
- It did circumvent a ugly,
very discriminatory regulation.

30:00.363 --> 30:03.453
- No, no, it violated
federal policy.

30:03.497 --> 30:04.672
I may have been a maverick,

30:04.715 --> 30:06.805
but I wasn't about to
become a criminal.

30:06.848 --> 30:10.243
The liability alone
would have crippled us.

30:10.286 --> 30:13.724
- What did you do with
all that blood?

30:13.768 --> 30:15.422
- Disposed of it.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.511
- Even though all
donated blood is screened?

30:17.554 --> 30:20.514
You threw it away, George.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.124
You could have helped people.

30:22.168 --> 30:24.257
And you chose not to.

30:30.350 --> 30:31.830
- You know, the last time
I checked,

30:31.873 --> 30:35.137
those were still
the FDA guidelines.

30:35.181 --> 30:37.009
And as far as I can tell,

30:37.052 --> 30:42.492
you aren't doing a damn thing
about them either.

30:51.719 --> 30:54.330
- Ella? Hi. <i>
- Hey, hey, Dr. Frome.</i>

30:54.374 --> 30:56.115
- Hi, are you okay?

30:56.158 --> 30:57.377
What about Vijay?
What's happening?

30:57.420 --> 30:59.205
<i>- No, hey, we're good.
We're all good.</i>

30:59.248 --> 31:00.902
<i>Um, I just have to be quick</i>

31:00.946 --> 31:02.208
<i>'cause he doesn't know
I'm calling you.</i>

31:02.251 --> 31:03.862
<i>I heard your messages.</i>

31:03.905 --> 31:06.734
- Okay, well,
I'm glad somebody did.

31:06.777 --> 31:10.042
<i>- Yeah, uh, Iggy,
you have been so good to him.</i>

31:10.085 --> 31:12.044
<i>To me.
-</i>

31:12.087 --> 31:14.437
<i>- You deserve to know
what's going on.</i>

31:16.613 --> 31:18.398
- You know, honestly, Ella,
I don't--

31:18.441 --> 31:21.314
I don't really care
anymore, so--

31:21.357 --> 31:24.056
<i>- Vijay's doctor told him
he's never gonna work again.</i>

31:24.099 --> 31:27.973
<i>Um, about a month ago.
He didn't want to believe it.</i>

31:28.016 --> 31:29.539
<i>He kept saying that
the guy was crazy,</i>

31:29.583 --> 31:31.019
<i>didn't know what
he was talking about.</i>

31:31.063 --> 31:33.761
<i>But, um, a couple days after,
he got ready,</i>

31:33.804 --> 31:36.068
<i>and decided to come into
the hospital early,</i>

31:36.111 --> 31:38.113
<i>and surprise everybody.</i>

31:38.157 --> 31:40.681
<i>Um, he couldn't make it out
the front door.</i>

31:48.123 --> 31:50.734
<i>He won't talk to me about it.</i>

31:50.778 --> 31:52.649
<i>He won't talk to anyone
right now.</i>

31:52.693 --> 31:55.261
<i>So, um,</i>

31:55.304 --> 31:57.785
<i>that's why I had to call.</i>

31:57.828 --> 32:00.266
<i>You know, so you'd know.
- Yeah.</i>

32:00.309 --> 32:02.703
<i>- Uh, a couple days ago,</i>

32:02.746 --> 32:04.487
<i>he told me a story about you.</i>

32:04.531 --> 32:07.099
<i>About a patient
who thought he was dead?</i>

32:07.142 --> 32:09.318
- Yeah. Yeah, I remember.

32:09.362 --> 32:11.799
<i>- And Vijay said how much
you helped the guy.</i>

32:11.842 --> 32:15.194
<i>Helped his fiancée
to understand.</i>

32:15.237 --> 32:16.978
<i>And Vijay said that</i>

32:17.022 --> 32:19.981
<i>he might have saved
the guy's life but--</i>

32:20.025 --> 32:22.679
<i>but you saved his soul.</i>

32:22.723 --> 32:24.072
<i>That's what you do.</i>

32:24.116 --> 32:26.857
<i>Dr. Frome, you just
go around saving souls.</i>

32:30.687 --> 32:32.428
I learned from the best.

32:40.001 --> 32:42.177
- Great news.
It's just a hemangioma,

32:42.221 --> 32:43.483
which is a collection
of blood vessels

32:43.526 --> 32:44.832
that should
disappear on their own.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.181
- Oh, my God. Thank God.

32:46.225 --> 32:48.096
Okay.
- So, next step is to

32:48.140 --> 32:49.837
adjust your antiretrovirals.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.360
I'll need to see you
back here tomorrow.

32:51.404 --> 32:52.535
- Oh, my God,
I'm so behind on work.

32:52.579 --> 32:54.407
There's no way
I can come in tomorrow.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.279
Your HIV care is important,
Karla.

32:57.323 --> 32:58.977
- Yes, I know it's important,

32:59.020 --> 33:00.761
but it didn't give me cancer,
right?

33:00.804 --> 33:02.415
Didn't almost kill me.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.504
So can I call you when
I come back up for air?

33:06.288 --> 33:08.987
- Perfect. Next time I see you,
it'll be in the morgue.

33:11.859 --> 33:14.470
You are walking out of here.

33:14.514 --> 33:16.037
You're lucky,
'cause the kind of cancer

33:16.081 --> 33:17.430
we thought you had is deadly,

33:17.473 --> 33:20.433
and it's God's own luck
that you don't have it.

33:20.476 --> 33:23.001
If what you take from this
is that you can continue

33:23.044 --> 33:24.611
treating your HIV
like it's hay fever,

33:24.654 --> 33:26.482
then I have no doubt
I'll be seeing you very soon,

33:26.526 --> 33:28.484
whether you have room
in your schedule or not.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.357
- Um, tomorrow's good.

33:35.752 --> 33:36.971
- I can take him from here.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.842
- Ah, this one.

33:38.886 --> 33:40.888
- This one, unfortunately.
You mind?

33:40.931 --> 33:43.630
- I don't retract
a word I wrote.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.849
Shame then, shame now.

33:45.893 --> 33:49.201
Yeah, well, I hope you don't,
because you were right.

33:50.550 --> 33:53.901
Dale, I'd like you to meet
Howie Cournemeyer.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.560
- Mr. Cournemeyer--
- Howie.

34:02.736 --> 34:04.607
Excited to meet you.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.566
- You know, the gay blood ban?

34:06.609 --> 34:08.046
It's not just a regulation.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.525
It's hate.

34:09.569 --> 34:11.919
We should be ashamed
for allowing it.

34:11.962 --> 34:15.357
So I'm initiating a new policy
regarding the gay blood ban.

34:15.401 --> 34:17.055
I'm ignoring it.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.579
And Howie is our first donor.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.672
- You can't.
They'll strip your funding.

34:28.196 --> 34:29.980
-
Yeah.

34:30.024 --> 34:31.678
Well, then we'll just take
them to court.

34:31.721 --> 34:33.201
And when we win,

34:33.245 --> 34:37.075
they will throw that
bigoted law in the trash,

34:37.118 --> 34:39.077
thanks to you.

34:43.646 --> 34:47.172
- I've been screaming about
this nonsense for 30 years,

34:47.215 --> 34:50.436
and nothing happened.

34:50.479 --> 34:52.264
Look what you did.

35:02.709 --> 35:05.103
- Hey, I'm finishing my chart
on Karla.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.582
Any surprises at discharge?

35:06.626 --> 35:09.107
- Uh, no. She just needed
a little bit of tough love.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.586
- Scared her to death, huh?
-

35:10.630 --> 35:12.588
- Love it when
you get all Mama Bear.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.112
- A quality
that's deserted me now that

35:14.155 --> 35:16.549
there's a Baby Bear
in my office.

35:16.592 --> 35:18.768
Um, honestly,

35:18.812 --> 35:20.335
Mina walked all over me today,

35:20.379 --> 35:21.858
and I'm just letting her do it.

35:21.902 --> 35:23.164
I--I don't know what to say.

35:23.208 --> 35:26.124
- Just talk to her
like she's a patient.

35:26.167 --> 35:27.690
- But she's not.

35:27.734 --> 35:30.258
I mean her father's just died,
she's in a new country.

35:30.302 --> 35:31.694
If someone should be
playing bad cop with her,

35:31.738 --> 35:33.653
it really shouldn't be me.
I barely know her.

35:33.696 --> 35:35.350
I'm not her aunt at all.
Really, I'm just--

35:35.394 --> 35:38.397
some woman.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.747
- My sister and I,
we're both addicts

35:40.790 --> 35:42.618
who only trust chaos and

35:42.662 --> 35:45.708
are incapable of having
intimate relationships.

35:45.752 --> 35:48.929
That's what happens when no one
gives you boundaries.

35:48.972 --> 35:50.713
You're all Mina has now.

35:50.757 --> 35:53.542
You've got to be her mother,
her aunt, her friend.

35:53.586 --> 35:54.891
Her everything.

35:54.935 --> 35:58.156
And if you can't do that
then, yeah, you're right.

35:58.199 --> 36:02.247
You're just some woman
who doesn't deserve her.

36:02.290 --> 36:05.511
- Those are wise words
coming from someone that

36:05.554 --> 36:07.904
let a stranger
live in our storage closet.

36:07.948 --> 36:09.993
- Well, you can't win 'em all.

36:10.037 --> 36:12.344
-
- Good luck.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.179
- Hi!
- Here's Baby Dahmer.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.050
- That bad?

36:23.093 --> 36:25.574
- When she wasn't
gnawing on me,

36:25.618 --> 36:27.663
I checked out
some parenting blogs.

36:27.707 --> 36:30.013
Um, apparently
biting's pretty normal,

36:30.057 --> 36:31.928
so I wouldn't, like,
beat yourself up.

36:31.972 --> 36:35.845
- Yeah, I guess it's their way
of, I don't know, acting out.

36:35.889 --> 36:39.675
I--she's trying to tell me
she's missing something.

36:39.719 --> 36:42.504
- Yeah, her data plan,
by the looks of it.

36:45.725 --> 36:47.770
- Her grandma.

36:47.814 --> 36:49.381
- Oh, problem solved.

36:49.424 --> 36:51.165
Can't she just spend more time
with her?

36:51.209 --> 36:53.341
- Uh...

36:55.082 --> 36:56.910
Gwen would love nothing more.

36:56.953 --> 37:00.087
- And that's bad because...?

37:03.308 --> 37:06.311
- Just means I can't
do this on my own.

37:11.794 --> 37:14.057
- Max.

37:14.101 --> 37:16.234
I don't think
you're supposed to.

37:21.935 --> 37:24.894
- Days like this make me think
of His mysterious ways.

37:37.907 --> 37:39.431

37:47.090 --> 37:49.005
Well, not thinking.

37:49.049 --> 37:50.703
