05:18.752 --> 05:21.596
Deep! Deep! Deep! Deep!

05:21.655 --> 05:22.224
Hello.

05:22.289 --> 05:25.293
Deep, why are all these
girls standing in a line?

05:25.692 --> 05:29.606
I know...they all want
you to hit on them, right?

05:29.663 --> 05:30.767
No, silly.

05:31.264 --> 05:35.610
They all want Deep to beep them.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.078
Beep? Meaning?

05:38.071 --> 05:38.515
Let me explain?

05:38.572 --> 05:40.643
You see...
I care for our society.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.414
I don't want to be
a bad influence on anyone.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.189
That's why I automatically...

05:45.412 --> 05:46.356
...'beep' all the bad words.

05:46.413 --> 05:49.053
For example...
if I want to cuss someone.

05:49.115 --> 05:50.116
<i>|</i> 53y..-

05:50.784 --> 05:52.024
You're such a big 'beep'.

05:52.085 --> 05:52.654
Oh...

05:52.719 --> 05:54.426
And you're a bigger 'beep' than him.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.694
Why don't you both 'beep' off!

05:58.391 --> 05:58.766
Viagra...

05:59.025 --> 06:00.231
<i>|</i> mean...etcetera...etcetera.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.037
Who are these two girls?

06:02.729 --> 06:06.233
She's my right hand...
and she's my left.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.206
Aren't you my right hand?

06:09.269 --> 06:10.111
Stand there.

06:10.170 --> 06:10.739
You come here.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.744
Don't keep changing places,
I get confused.

06:14.140 --> 06:14.675
Hold it.

06:15.575 --> 06:16.315
So I was saying...

06:16.376 --> 06:18.413
She's my right
hand...and she's my left.

06:18.478 --> 06:22.016
Sometimes I use my right hand...
and sometimes my left.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.083
Sometimes I use both.

06:23.149 --> 06:26.028
Tell me something Beep...
I mean Deep.

06:26.453 --> 06:28.524
Back in college...
when it came to girls...

06:28.588 --> 06:29.498
...you were a pauper.

06:30.457 --> 06:33.097
So how did you become a Prince now?

06:33.159 --> 06:35.639
Not a prince...
but 'Mastizaada' (king of fun).

06:35.695 --> 06:37.003
What's 'Mastizaada'.

06:37.597 --> 06:39.770
The world calls them rascals.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.706
Girls say...give me more.

06:43.303 --> 06:46.113
That's the real 'Mastizaada'.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.747
Deep, even we want to be
'Mastizaada' like you.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.318
Then follow this simple rule.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.354
Always listen to your elders.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.087
Otherwise you will always lose out...

06:56.182 --> 06:57.252
...on the fun that's coming your way.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.295
I see...

06:58.385 --> 06:59.420
It was a stormy night...

07:00.053 --> 07:01.498
...and I was dropping
an old lady home.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.034
She politely said to me...

07:03.089 --> 07:04.227
"Son, it's raining quite heavily..."

07:04.291 --> 07:05.292
"...why don't you sleep over tonight."

07:05.358 --> 07:07.065
"|n fact,
you can sleep in Bunty's room."

07:07.127 --> 07:08.299
And I said "Bunty".

07:08.695 --> 07:10.732
"No Aunty,
I'll sleep out here on the sofa."

07:11.164 --> 07:12.575
And I slept on the sofa.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.337
It was dawn soon.

07:16.603 --> 07:20.380
Hello. Good morning.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.990
"Talk to me."

07:33.186 --> 07:34.631
"Yeah."

07:35.755 --> 07:38.326
You?
- I am Bunty.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.393
"Hello..."

07:40.460 --> 07:43.134
You...are...Bunty?
- Yes.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.266
And you are?

07:47.100 --> 07:48.579
If you're Bunty...

07:49.569 --> 07:51.708
...then I am a 'beep' hole.

07:52.339 --> 07:55.047
A big 'beep' hole.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.109
Talk to me.

07:58.678 --> 07:59.554
Excuse me.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.353
Mastizaadon.

08:05.051 --> 08:07.327
Go and conquer the world.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.995
And whenever you need me...

08:10.056 --> 08:12.559
...you'|| find your
friend standing here.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.436
At One Night Stand.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.032
Now leave.

08:19.432 --> 08:20.103
Don't just sit there.

08:20.166 --> 08:20.735
Go on.

08:21.368 --> 08:22.142
Beep off."

08:22.202 --> 08:24.182
You dog.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.389
lam Doctor Markholkar.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.582
And I'm an expert in driving out...

08:35.648 --> 08:36.592
...the sex virus that's in all of you.

08:36.649 --> 08:37.592
Yeah!

08:39.052 --> 08:41.123
Sex-addiction is a real problem.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.428
And the patient is always...

08:43.490 --> 08:46.494
...under the grasp of lust.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.635
He always thinks of only one thing.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.538
Sex.

08:50.597 --> 08:53.009
And in order to save all of you...

08:53.066 --> 08:55.637
...from this addiction,
I've started this rehab.

08:55.702 --> 08:59.411
Last week...| gave our
group members homework...

08:59.472 --> 09:02.282
...to make a report
on the dangers, reasons...

09:02.342 --> 09:05.585
...and techniques
to counter sex-addiction.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.591
And the first ones
to present their reports...

09:07.647 --> 09:11.493
...are Mr. Aditya Chotiya
and Mr. Sunny Kele...

09:11.551 --> 09:14.361
...who joined our group few weeks ago.

09:15.021 --> 09:15.362
Wow!

09:15.422 --> 09:16.594
Thank you.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.192
Thank you.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.742
The most defamed fruit
in the world is apple.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.644
History has taught us...

09:29.269 --> 09:31.749
...that Adam and Eve
were thrown out of Eden...

09:32.005 --> 09:33.382
...because of an apple.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.580
But the truth is...
Adam got in trouble...

09:37.477 --> 09:40.651
...because of his Banana,
and not the Apple.

09:41.081 --> 09:41.991
Yes, friends.

09:42.082 --> 09:42.719
Banana.

09:42.982 --> 09:45.519
Whenever a man or a woman slips...

09:45.585 --> 09:49.089
...the reason is always a banana.

09:56.196 --> 09:56.731
Yes!

09:56.996 --> 09:58.737
We both follow a simple
philosophy in life.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.534
If you want to plant your sapling...

10:00.600 --> 10:04.343
...then find a land that's ready.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.577
Posing as fake sex-addicts
and blaming the apple...

10:06.639 --> 10:08.312
...is just an excuse.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.581
Because the national
fruit of the world...

10:11.578 --> 10:13.114
...is a bloody banana.

10:14.013 --> 10:17.756
I know...those who take advantage...

10:18.017 --> 10:20.054
...of people's weakness
are scoundrels.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.656
But we're not scoundrels.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.064
We're just...

10:23.623 --> 10:24.567
Mastizaade!

10:24.624 --> 10:27.161
"Mastizaade."

10:28.128 --> 10:30.267
"Mastizaade."

10:30.330 --> 10:31.673
"We're the kings..."

10:31.731 --> 10:33.438
"We're the Singhams."

10:33.500 --> 10:35.343
"Welcome to fun."

10:35.401 --> 10:37.142
"Mastizaade."

10:37.203 --> 10:37.738
"We're the kings..."

10:37.804 --> 10:38.748
"We're the Singhams."

10:38.805 --> 10:40.580
"We're the kings...
We're the Singhams."

10:40.640 --> 10:42.449
"Welcome to fun."

10:42.509 --> 10:44.182
"Mastizaade."

10:44.244 --> 10:47.350
"So let me come."

10:49.115 --> 10:50.287
You're too good.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.294
Like that...

10:51.351 --> 10:52.352
Do it. Do it.

11:00.293 --> 11:03.433
That photo on the table,
is that your husband?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.372
Huh!

11:05.064 --> 11:06.407
No, sweety.

11:07.200 --> 11:11.080
I see...then it must
be your boyfriend.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.011
I don't have a boyfriend.

11:14.607 --> 11:18.180
Oh...that means he's your son.

11:19.412 --> 11:23.326
I must say...
you've really maintained yourself.

11:23.616 --> 11:26.324
I don't have a son.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.530
I get it he's your brother.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.435
Big or small?

11:33.026 --> 11:35.438
Sweety, I don't have a brother.

11:35.628 --> 11:36.800
Uncle.
- No.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.369
Uncle.
- No.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.241
Then he must be your neighbour.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.609
Correct?
- Wrong.

11:43.102 --> 11:45.378
Then whose photo is in your room?

11:45.438 --> 11:48.044
And so close to your bed.

11:48.341 --> 11:52.551
Sweety...that's my picture.

11:52.612 --> 11:54.353
I had it taken before my operation.

12:05.491 --> 12:07.562
"Mastizaade."

12:08.561 --> 12:11.303
Oh yeah.
- "Mastizaade."

12:11.364 --> 12:12.604
Honey, I am home.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.108
My husband's here..
- Husband.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.340
My husband.
- Husband.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.348
Just go.
- What do you mean go?

12:18.404 --> 12:19.781
Just go...
- What about my clothes?

12:21.307 --> 12:23.218
Why are you running nude?

12:23.276 --> 12:24.311
What the...

12:25.211 --> 12:28.715
Do you always run naked?
- Yes.

12:29.716 --> 12:31.787
You see...l love it.

12:32.518 --> 12:34.088
I feel very free.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.096
Do you always run wearing a condom?
- Yes...

12:41.728 --> 12:43.730
No! Not always.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.537
Only during the monsoons.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.339
Monsoon?

12:48.067 --> 12:49.341
So that it doesn't get wet.

12:50.637 --> 12:51.638
Raincoat.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.680
Guys, your sex life is so exciting.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.557
It's been ages since I last had sex.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.185
Your parents are to be blamed for it.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.728
They named you She-kar.

13:04.984 --> 13:05.394
What...

13:05.451 --> 13:07.658
Since then...
you've always been a shaker.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.691
Give me few tips please.

13:09.756 --> 13:10.996
No, silly boy.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.001
Superman can only teach you...

13:13.059 --> 13:14.732
...to wear your underwear
over your pants.

13:14.994 --> 13:15.768
But not how to fly.

13:16.095 --> 13:18.234
We were born with our superpowers.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.709
Superpowers?
- Yes.

13:19.999 --> 13:21.603
I didn't get it.
- Let me explain you.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.311
Superman has x-rays.

13:24.370 --> 13:28.079
But we've got... chicks-ray.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.449
Chicks-ray?

13:29.509 --> 13:30.112
Yes.

13:30.176 --> 13:31.348
I didn't get it again.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.221
Wait silly boy,
we'll show you a demonstration.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.657
Yeah...

13:35.715 --> 13:36.693
Look.

13:38.217 --> 13:39.719
That madam's wearing pink.

13:42.121 --> 13:45.568
And look...that one's wearing grey,
top and bottom.

13:45.625 --> 13:46.433
Wow.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.266
See?
- I don't see anything.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.239
Hold on.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.038
Oh my, God. Look at that.

13:55.635 --> 13:56.579
Yes!

13:56.636 --> 13:58.240
ere)!-

14:01.474 --> 14:02.009
Chicks-ray.

14:02.075 --> 14:02.416
Chicks-ray.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.078
Chicks-ray.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.215
What powers, guys.

14:05.278 --> 14:09.317
There's not a single girl...

14:09.382 --> 14:13.262
...who can escape our
chicks-ray and our powers.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.397
Exactly.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.489
There's been no one yet.

14:32.705 --> 14:38.417
"A|| night long everyone
just stares at you."

15:03.369 --> 15:06.077
Hi, Chotu.

15:18.384 --> 15:20.193
Oranges.
- What?

15:20.453 --> 15:23.195
I want to squeeze
the juice out of them.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.429
It's healthy after all.

15:25.758 --> 15:29.729
By the way,
I hope I didn't disturb you.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.600
No, no...not at all.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.305
I was playing with my pusky.

15:36.702 --> 15:39.649
Playing with what?
- Pusky.

15:39.705 --> 15:43.710
You like puskys, right?
- I love them.

15:43.776 --> 15:48.725
You know...small, cute...

15:50.383 --> 15:53.694
Actually, I was on Skype with her.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.293
Pusky.

15:57.089 --> 15:58.727
Meow!

15:59.592 --> 16:00.366
Well...

16:02.261 --> 16:03.239
Here you go.

16:04.430 --> 16:07.070
Squeeze the juice
out of them properly.

16:07.133 --> 16:10.671
Yes, I will squeeze them out properly.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.312
By the way.
- Yeah.

16:13.372 --> 16:17.081

And hold both the balls carefully.

16:57.116 --> 16:57.719
Bye.

16:59.519 --> 17:05.060
No one likes playing with...
dirty footballs.

17:05.124 --> 17:07.104
So how can we keep our balls clean...

17:07.159 --> 17:09.195
...so that others
love playing with them?

17:09.262 --> 17:10.468

17:18.171 --> 17:21.983

17:22.040 --> 17:23.679
Wow!

17:26.345 --> 17:30.293

these golf balls first?

17:57.143 --> 18:00.317
‘My chicks-ray.‘
- Tick-Tock..

18:03.049 --> 18:06.053
I just love golf b...b...balls.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.972
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!

18:17.029 --> 18:20.101
Me! - You're quite desperate
to get your balls cleaned.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.406
Shekhar, you don't get it.

18:21.467 --> 18:24.175
She's different from other girls.

18:24.470 --> 18:25.744
Different? How?

18:26.138 --> 18:27.515
My chicks-ray isn't working on her.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.679
Mr. Safai's B...B...Balls cleaner.

18:30.743 --> 18:34.156
Playing with clean
balls is a lot more fun.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.489
It's a cut.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.722
Let's take some shots.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.055
Call the hand model.

18:40.119 --> 18:40.688

18:40.753 --> 18:42.528

Get the camera here.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.064
Move fatso.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.133
Excuse me.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.497
Aditya. Superb.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.197
What an idea for the campaign.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.139
Outstanding.

18:51.197 --> 18:52.505
I'll be right back Mr.
Bossdiwaala (Asshole).

18:52.565 --> 18:53.635
Please handle the campaign.

18:53.699 --> 18:56.646
Aditya, when you call
me Bossdiwaala (Asshole)...

18:56.702 --> 18:58.375
...| don't like it at all.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.073
You're my boss.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.482
Your name's D. Wala.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.487
What else will I call you?

19:03.542 --> 19:06.079
Call me by my real name. Dil.

19:06.145 --> 19:06.987
Dil?

19:07.046 --> 19:08.320
Dil Khadawala.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.694
My full name is Dil Khadawala.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.089
But my surname was Khadawala...

19:13.152 --> 19:14.995
...and people would tease me.

19:15.054 --> 19:17.500
So I took the 'Khada'
out and kept the 'Dil'.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.697
Now I am just Dilwala.
- Very Different.

19:20.960 --> 19:21.995
Sir, I am a bit busy.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.404
That reminds me, Aditya.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.464
We've a new client,
and they are rich.

19:25.531 --> 19:26.703
They're coming to the
office tomorrow morning...

19:26.966 --> 19:28.070
...and where's Sunny?

19:28.134 --> 19:29.511
Sir, he's outside
drinking sugarcane juice.

19:29.568 --> 19:33.311
Sunny's always drinking
sugarcane juice.

19:33.372 --> 19:34.715
Always...

19:35.074 --> 19:35.711
Anyway...tomorrow...

19:35.975 --> 19:37.386
You and Sunny, at the office.

19:37.443 --> 19:37.716
On time.

19:37.977 --> 19:38.751
Yes.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.556
Yes!
- Yes, Dil.

19:41.981 --> 19:42.755
Yeah!

19:45.184 --> 19:48.757
Swear on my pony...
what a set.

19:49.288 --> 19:51.165
What a cute kid.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.602
Just like his mother.
- Thank you.

19:53.659 --> 19:55.002
And anyway, his father...

19:55.061 --> 19:55.766
...ran off after he was born.

19:56.028 --> 20:00.101
Which fool wouldn't
want to father your kids?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.445
"O Baby."

20:05.137 --> 20:06.275
"O Baby."

20:12.411 --> 20:13.412
"O Baby."

20:19.585 --> 20:20.563
"O Baby."

20:23.289 --> 20:26.327
I wish I was 40 years younger.

20:33.499 --> 20:37.572
I wish...l was alive.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.712
Mummy...
- My kid.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.598
My chicks-ray.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.566
Bring my kid down.

21:01.227 --> 21:02.706
Bring my kid down.

21:03.329 --> 21:06.367
Bring my kid down.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.140
Bloody pervert,
you threw him upstairs.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.145
Get me down.

21:10.202 --> 21:11.613
Someone get my kid down.

21:13.572 --> 21:15.609
Lily.
- Hi.

21:15.674 --> 21:17.517
Calm down, I'll get him down.

21:17.576 --> 21:18.145
Hold on.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.621
He's coming down.

21:22.081 --> 21:22.525
Hi.

21:22.581 --> 21:23.753
Hurry up, bring him down.

21:24.016 --> 21:24.790
Come on.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.462
Careful. Careful.
- You shut up.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.430
Are you okay?

21:29.021 --> 21:30.591
Now lift it up.
- Loser.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.641
There was a sexy-lady
draped in a sari...

21:40.699 --> 21:41.734
Did you see her?
- Yes.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.712
She's special, I must find her.

21:43.769 --> 21:46.249
For the first time in life,
my chicks-ray didn't work.

21:46.272 --> 21:48.343
Mine too.
- Hey...she'll be my wife.

21:48.407 --> 21:49.044
Don't say such things.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.554
lam talking about my girl.

21:51.610 --> 21:54.113
For the first time in life,
my chicks-ray didn't work.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.250
Where did they go?

21:55.614 --> 21:57.059
No problem.

21:57.116 --> 21:58.686
We'll find them
if we're supposed to.

21:59.085 --> 22:02.066
Maybe this is God's idea
or His method to tell us..

22:02.121 --> 22:05.694
"Son, before you fall hook,
line and sinker..."

22:06.125 --> 22:08.196
"...you can pop some more cherries."

22:16.168 --> 22:17.579
Hello, friends.
- Hello.

22:17.636 --> 22:22.210
Addiction is the most
dangerous hobby in the world.

22:22.541 --> 22:25.351
And especially, when it's alcohol.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.657
And in order to save everyone...

22:27.713 --> 22:29.124
...from popping anything
bad in their mouth.

22:29.181 --> 22:32.025
I've given this lollypop to everyone.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.767
We got this addiction...
after our dad's death.

22:39.558 --> 22:41.401
As soon as he passed away...

22:41.660 --> 22:43.230
...we made our way to the bottles.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.367
But how did he die?

22:48.567 --> 22:52.310
Our father appointed
a sexy secretary on the job.

22:53.239 --> 22:54.217
10 days later...

22:54.273 --> 22:56.651
...he jumped from the
14th floor of his office...

22:56.709 --> 22:58.620
...and committed suicide.

22:58.677 --> 23:00.679
why? why? why?

23:04.216 --> 23:05.991
Father did everything he could?

23:06.452 --> 23:09.990
He bought a car for the secretary.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.629
And an engagement
ring worth one million.

23:12.691 --> 23:13.761
One million?

23:13.993 --> 23:15.700
A home worth 30 million.

23:15.761 --> 23:18.002
And after all that happiness...

23:19.064 --> 23:20.600
...one day father asked her..

23:21.166 --> 23:23.476
"Listen...can we have fun."

23:25.104 --> 23:26.447
And she said yes.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.349
I charge 1000 for one night.

23:30.009 --> 23:33.252
And father committed suicide.

23:35.014 --> 23:40.726
But friends, we haven't
touched alcohol for 6 months.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.622
Very goocL
. Wow!

23:42.688 --> 23:45.794
But tell us...
how did you two do it?

23:46.058 --> 23:47.696
"O Baby."

23:48.694 --> 23:49.764
We'll tell you.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.667
Wine..
- Oh, God. Alcohol.

23:54.733 --> 23:58.203
Why did you two bring
this poison here?

23:58.437 --> 24:00.417
This is our secret, sir.

24:00.472 --> 24:04.318
The real test is when
the bottle's in front of you...

24:04.376 --> 24:06.378
...and you still control yourself.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.584
And we've complete confidence.

24:08.647 --> 24:10.991
Even though you'll
be holding the bottle...

24:11.350 --> 24:13.523
...but you'll all
still control yourselves.

24:13.585 --> 24:16.361
Even if someone uncorks the bottles...

24:16.422 --> 24:18.333
...you will still control yourselves.

24:18.390 --> 24:20.768
Someone will pour
the alcohol in a glass...

24:21.393 --> 24:24.067
...yet you will still
control yourselves.

24:24.196 --> 24:26.733
Someone will drop two
cubes of ice in the glass.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.645
But you will still control yourselves.

24:28.701 --> 24:31.375
No, pleasemplease...

24:34.740 --> 24:35.741
"O Baby"

24:38.611 --> 24:40.215
"O Baby"

24:41.714 --> 24:43.318
"O Baby"

24:49.088 --> 24:50.192
"O Baby"

24:56.562 --> 24:58.473
"| danced too much."

24:58.530 --> 25:01.670
"Please don't touch."

25:04.036 --> 25:05.640
"| danced too much."

25:05.704 --> 25:07.479
"Please don't touch."

25:07.539 --> 25:11.043
"l am tired shaking a leg all clay."

25:11.277 --> 25:15.623
"| don't have the strength
to dance anymore."

25:15.681 --> 25:19.322
"The boys say more...
more...more...more..."

25:19.385 --> 25:22.696
"The boysmdance some more...
dance some more."

25:23.088 --> 25:26.262
"The boys say more...
more...more...more..."

25:26.492 --> 25:30.440
"The boysmdance some more...
dance some more."

25:30.496 --> 25:33.773
"The boys say more...
more...more...more..."

25:34.133 --> 25:39.139

26:13.138 --> 26:17.985
"And starting to be shameless."

26:18.410 --> 26:22.051
"Plug my pin in your socket."

26:22.114 --> 26:25.721
"Charge my heart day and night."

26:25.751 --> 26:29.358
"Plug my pin in your socket."

26:29.421 --> 26:33.267
"Charge my heart day and night."

26:33.325 --> 26:37.364
"No matter how much I ignore..."

26:37.596 --> 26:41.066

"O Baby."

27:07.226 --> 27:08.227
"O Baby."

27:09.728 --> 27:12.538
"Whether in a flat or a shed."

27:15.200 --> 27:18.113
"A|| they want to do is have fun."

27:18.337 --> 27:20.214
"We're going to climb up."

27:20.439 --> 27:22.077
"Because we're men super."

27:22.141 --> 27:24.143
"We're going to honk the horns."

27:24.209 --> 27:25.517
"And you ride our scooters."

27:25.711 --> 27:27.520
"We're going to climb up."

27:27.713 --> 27:29.317
"Because we're men super."

27:29.381 --> 27:31.019
"We're going to honk the horns."

27:31.216 --> 27:32.718
"And you ride our scooters."

27:33.085 --> 27:37.363
"| am bored of these talks."

27:37.589 --> 27:41.002
"The boys say more...

27:41.360 --> 27:44.705
"The boysmdance some more...

27:44.763 --> 27:48.210
"The boys say more...

"O Baby"

28:22.067 --> 28:23.341
"O Baby"

28:24.736 --> 28:26.579
Welcome. Welcome.

28:27.639 --> 28:29.710
Ram-Ram.
- Leela-Leela.

28:29.975 --> 28:31.079
Leela?
- Leela?

28:31.143 --> 28:32.747
Not Lee|a...Gi|a (Wet).

28:33.011 --> 28:35.321
Maybe your seat's wet.
I guess it was wet before.

28:35.347 --> 28:36.553
Don't worry. Don't worry.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.588
This is Sunny, and that's Aditya.

28:40.519 --> 28:42.590
Our company's star ad-film makers.

28:42.621 --> 28:43.395
Thank you, thank you.

28:43.455 --> 28:45.492
Show them your product.

28:45.991 --> 28:47.402
And they will make an ad film...

28:47.459 --> 28:49.029
...that will make you crazy.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.202
Should l, papa?
- Show it.

28:51.630 --> 28:52.608
Take it out.

28:53.165 --> 28:54.235
Take it out.

28:56.702 --> 28:57.737
Take it out already.

29:07.613 --> 29:09.024
'Goti' is a soda bottle.

29:09.548 --> 29:12.051
‘Gol Goti‘ soda bottle.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.659
It's quite popular in
few selected states in India.

29:15.721 --> 29:16.426
I see.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.695
And we want to launch
it in the entire country.

29:18.957 --> 29:19.594
Wow.

29:19.658 --> 29:23.697
Because when the marble moves...

29:24.296 --> 29:26.037
...the soda fizzes.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.342
What are you saying, sir?

29:28.400 --> 29:29.105
Papa.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.238
It's true...

29:30.335 --> 29:32.542
The marbles must move.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.050
When the marbles
move...with passion...

29:35.107 --> 29:37.109
...that's when you say
'Aah' with pleasure.

29:37.176 --> 29:38.280
Right?
- Yes.

29:38.510 --> 29:39.648
Don't worry.

29:39.711 --> 29:42.214
We'll make an ad for your marbles...

29:42.281 --> 29:44.283
...that will make
the world stand up...and

29:44.349 --> 29:46.386
And what?
- Clap! Clap!

29:46.451 --> 29:48.260
Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap!

29:48.754 --> 29:50.756
All over Maharastra people will say.

29:51.156 --> 29:54.000
Forget sodamand hold Goti (marbles).

29:54.993 --> 29:57.132
So sir...whether big or small...

29:58.096 --> 30:01.475
...everyone will taste your marbles.

30:03.235 --> 30:04.737
Papa..
- Great.

30:05.571 --> 30:08.245
Now we handover our marbles to you.

30:08.307 --> 30:12.414
Hoping that you will
take care of our marbles...

30:12.444 --> 30:15.425
...|ike they are our own marbles.

30:16.014 --> 30:18.392
Sir, your marbles are my marbles.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.192
All yours. All yours.

30:21.286 --> 30:22.663
Done. Done.

30:22.721 --> 30:24.792
Ram-Ram.
- Leela. Leela.

30:26.625 --> 30:27.603
Papa doesn't have it.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.036
But he does have marbles.

30:35.434 --> 30:36.811
When you don't have a mouth...

30:37.803 --> 30:39.282
...you do it with your hands.

30:39.538 --> 30:42.519
Forget her...
and wear this Lawman jeans.

30:43.241 --> 30:44.743
Bro, it's a patented product.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.278
Boss...it's got emboss.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.552
Let's go find some
new sex-addict group.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.321
lam feeling really guilty.

30:50.816 --> 30:53.126
I really feel...
deep-down in my heart...

30:53.185 --> 30:55.256
...that I cheated on my girl.

30:55.287 --> 30:56.698
I was so drunk...

30:57.222 --> 31:00.169
...| really thought my
girl's lying on the bed...

31:00.625 --> 31:01.695
...and calling me.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.104
What are you saying?

31:03.662 --> 31:06.700
You know what...| felt the same.

31:07.265 --> 31:09.211
This means...we both didn't cheat.

31:09.468 --> 31:14.042
Because...our body may
have been with someone else...

31:14.106 --> 31:19.146
...but our heart thought
that we're with our girl.

31:19.311 --> 31:20.051
Right.

31:20.712 --> 31:21.622
Silly.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.418
After hitting on
so many sex-addicts...

31:24.783 --> 31:26.785
...you've become
a sex-addict yourself.

31:27.252 --> 31:29.027
History stands witness.

31:29.321 --> 31:31.631
If you keep your banana
unused too long...

31:32.090 --> 31:33.763
...it starts to rot.

31:34.459 --> 31:37.531
Now wear this Lawman
jeansmand be the man.

31:37.596 --> 31:41.203
Be the star...
and let's go find our prey.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.878
Seema Lele Sex-addicts organization.

31:45.771 --> 31:48.547
What...a boring place.

31:48.607 --> 31:51.144
Yeah...we'|| get nothing here.

31:51.209 --> 31:52.210
Yeah, let's go.

31:52.277 --> 31:55.622
Hey, Lily.
- Hi.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.389
I know.

32:00.652 --> 32:03.189
Are you seeing what I am seeing?

32:03.255 --> 32:05.394
Yeah...doub|e role.

32:05.457 --> 32:06.458
So.

32:06.491 --> 32:08.471
Someone said it right...

32:08.760 --> 32:11.070
Two is more fun.

32:11.129 --> 32:13.370
One's Sita.
- So nice.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.740
And the other's Gita.

32:16.034 --> 32:17.411
Yes, mine's Sita...
and your's Gita.

32:17.469 --> 32:18.447
Okay, okay...

32:18.503 --> 32:20.380
But what are they doing here?

32:20.439 --> 32:22.476
Are these two sex-addicts?

32:22.541 --> 32:24.714
If they mistake us
for real sex-addicts...

32:24.776 --> 32:26.551
...then they will never love us.

32:26.611 --> 32:29.182
A thief can never point
fingers at another thief.

32:29.247 --> 32:31.591
If we're sex-addicts in their view...

32:31.616 --> 32:32.754
...then so are they.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.266
Let's go.
- Yes, let's go watch.

32:36.321 --> 32:37.299
Hi, everyone.

32:37.355 --> 32:38.766
lam Laila Lele.

32:39.024 --> 32:42.767
And this is my twin sister Lily Lele.

32:43.195 --> 32:46.267
Together we run this
sex-addicts group.

32:46.331 --> 32:47.742
We're in trouble.

32:47.766 --> 32:49.473
They're not thieves,
they're the jailors.

32:49.534 --> 32:51.741
Well friends, our mother...

32:52.304 --> 32:53.374
Seema Lele.

32:53.438 --> 32:56.715
Was a s...s..sex-addict herself.

32:59.444 --> 33:01.287
Yummy MummY!

33:01.546 --> 33:03.719
Yummy MummY!

33:04.249 --> 33:07.321
Yummy...Yummy... Mummy!

33:07.486 --> 33:10.626
Our father was a character
actor in Hindi movies.

33:11.089 --> 33:14.195
90 percent of his roles
were of an army man.

33:15.527 --> 33:18.701
And he went so crazy
playing his roles...

33:19.164 --> 33:21.201
...that whenever
there was a real war...

33:21.600 --> 33:25.013
...he would wear his army costume...

33:25.070 --> 33:30.679
...and for months
s...s...stand at the border.

33:31.543 --> 33:36.322
Baba wanted army...
and mama wanted fun.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.092
Father always said...

33:39.284 --> 33:42.595
"| will never let the enemies..."

33:43.388 --> 33:46.232
"...penetrate the
borders and get inside."

33:47.259 --> 33:49.603
But someone would penetrate...

33:51.129 --> 33:55.635
...her borders everyday and
g..g..get inside.

33:56.101 --> 33:59.412
Friends,
I've thought of a new experiment.

33:59.638 --> 34:07.022
To test whether you're
still sex-addicts or not.

34:15.053 --> 34:18.659
If the coin moves, you fail.

34:19.324 --> 34:20.768
I hope you fail.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.272
"She'll take your heart."

34:27.165 --> 34:29.610
"She'll take your |ife."

34:30.534 --> 34:33.414
"She'll take your sincerity too."

34:33.472 --> 34:35.179
"Laila's going to..."

34:35.239 --> 34:36.583
"Laila's going to..."

34:36.641 --> 34:42.023
"Laila's going to...sweep you away..."

34:45.550 --> 34:47.688
"She'll take your heart."

34:49.321 --> 34:51.527
"She'll take your |ife."

34:53.058 --> 34:54.696
"She'll take your heart."

34:54.759 --> 34:56.466
"She'll take your |ife."

34:56.527 --> 34:59.202
"She'll take your sincerity too."

34:59.264 --> 35:04.304
"Laila's going to...sweep you away..."

35:04.436 --> 35:09.977
"Laila's going to...sweep you away..."

35:26.625 --> 35:28.229
Very good...

35:30.295 --> 35:32.241
Aditya.
- Aditya!

35:32.998 --> 35:34.306
Aditya.
- Aditya!

35:34.366 --> 35:35.276
Aditya.

35:35.333 --> 35:36.437
Very good, Aditya.

35:37.068 --> 35:41.039
Seeing your self-
con...con...control...

35:41.573 --> 35:42.745
...| am really happy.

35:45.110 --> 35:46.020
Good boy.

35:49.247 --> 35:50.658
Lookmshooting star.

35:51.116 --> 35:51.594
Wow!

35:51.616 --> 35:54.062
They say, if you make
a wish to a shooting star...

35:54.119 --> 35:55.655
...it comes true.

36:01.026 --> 36:03.597
My favourite Gol Goti Soda.
- Wow!

36:08.533 --> 36:10.103
Why don't you ask for something too?

36:19.477 --> 36:21.115
Gol Goti Soda.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.988
Gives you big fun.

36:23.982 --> 36:27.327
I've never seen anything
so lowly and humiliating.

36:27.686 --> 36:28.994
Me neither.

36:29.621 --> 36:32.192
Will parents ever let their
daughter drink our soda...

36:32.257 --> 36:33.463
...after watching this ad?

36:33.525 --> 36:35.198
We trusted you two...

36:35.260 --> 36:37.365
...and handed over our marbles to you.

36:37.429 --> 36:41.309
And you did foul-play
with our marbles.

36:41.366 --> 36:45.280
No, no, sir. We didn't do
any foul play with your marbles.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.743
Swear on my pony.
Give us one more chance.

36:48.006 --> 36:48.416
No, no...

36:48.440 --> 36:50.784
We'll make a clean and
family-oriented ad for you.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.022
As long as these two
are working for you...

36:53.078 --> 36:54.557
...we won't give you our marbles.

36:54.613 --> 36:55.523
We won't.

36:56.314 --> 36:57.588
Swear on my pony...

36:57.649 --> 36:58.787
For the sake of your marbles...

36:59.050 --> 37:00.222
...| will fire these
two from the company.

37:00.952 --> 37:04.092
Bloodymtwo-faced, low-life...

37:04.155 --> 37:06.726
...were you born out of a test-tube?

37:07.092 --> 37:09.038
After playing marbles
in your childhood...

37:09.094 --> 37:11.506
...didn't you ever play
banana games behind closed doors.

37:11.563 --> 37:12.064
Shut up.

37:12.130 --> 37:12.972
Don't get personal.

37:13.031 --> 37:13.566
Shut up.

37:14.199 --> 37:15.269
And you...

37:15.333 --> 37:17.313
Bloody Polar Bear's twin marbles.

37:17.369 --> 37:18.541
You wanted marbles, didn't you?

37:18.603 --> 37:19.741
Take this...and this...

37:22.507 --> 37:24.077
Security.

37:24.309 --> 37:25.117
Get out!

37:25.176 --> 37:26.416
Now wait and watch.

37:26.478 --> 37:28.151
We'll start our own ad agency.

37:28.213 --> 37:30.022
And we'll make ads...

37:30.081 --> 37:34.359
...that will make you
hold your marbles and pony.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.056
Get out!

37:35.120 --> 37:36.565
Now listen...

37:36.755 --> 37:38.701
We're going straight
to the bank from here.

37:38.757 --> 37:41.033
Tomorrow we'll have a loan...

37:41.092 --> 37:43.003
...and you will be alone.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.005
Out!

37:44.529 --> 37:45.769
Throw them out of the gate.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.276
We'll have it today.

37:54.773 --> 37:55.547
Loan.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.279
Swear on the pony.

38:05.016 --> 38:06.620
"Ooh Aah Ooh Aah
- Ouch!"

38:07.519 --> 38:10.295
"Come on my couch."

38:12.056 --> 38:13.694
"Ooh Aah Ooh Aah
- Ouch!"

38:15.493 --> 38:19.441
"Ooh Aah Ooh Aah

38:25.203 --> 38:26.443
"The wannabe..."

38:29.240 --> 38:31.379
"l like that."

38:33.011 --> 38:33.580
Good morning, ma'am.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.283
Notjust houseful, she's blouseful.

...those three magical words.

46:40.631 --> 46:43.373
I won't do anything.

46:44.168 --> 46:45.772
What do you want to hear?

46:46.037 --> 46:51.009
Those three magical words.

46:51.075 --> 46:52.179
You know, Laila.

46:52.476 --> 46:55.252
I never thought I'll say
those three magical words...

46:55.313 --> 46:57.156
...to any girl.
- Yes, say it.

46:57.215 --> 46:59.718
But Lai|a...| Love You.

47:02.353 --> 47:04.026
I don't believe this, Sunny.

47:04.088 --> 47:07.968
Laila...you said you wanted
to hear the three magical words.

47:08.025 --> 47:08.730
Yes, Sunny.

47:08.993 --> 47:12.167
Those three magical
words are not I Love you.

47:12.229 --> 47:14.607
Those three magical words are..
Laila...

- To Me.

47:16.534 --> 47:18.013
Laila...Give-it to me.

47:18.436 --> 47:20.438
First time in my life
I fell in love.

47:20.504 --> 47:22.177
And with a girl...

47:22.240 --> 47:24.720
...whose view about love
is same as I had earlier?

47:25.242 --> 47:29.054
She doesn't run this group
with Lily for social service.

47:30.014 --> 47:33.552
In fact, she takes advantage
of sex-addicts for fun.

47:33.618 --> 47:34.358
She says...

47:34.418 --> 47:37.399

47:53.237 --> 47:55.114
I've some great news.

47:55.406 --> 47:59.252
Today I want to
o...o...open|y show you...

47:59.310 --> 48:02.951
...who dwells in my heart.

48:03.014 --> 48:04.516
I guess she's talking about you.

48:05.483 --> 48:09.954
He's not perfect,
but he's perfect for me.

48:18.996 --> 48:20.998
Stupid.

48:41.052 --> 48:45.467
This is my fianc...Desh-Premi Singh.

48:47.692 --> 48:49.535
There are only three things I love.

48:49.593 --> 48:52.597
"Dharti Maa" Mother India.

48:52.663 --> 48:54.506
"Dharti Maa".

48:55.166 --> 48:56.645
And the mother of my future kids.

48:57.768 --> 49:00.476
Why did you say ‘Dharti Maa‘ twice?

49:00.538 --> 49:03.212
Because this land is my mother.

49:03.274 --> 49:04.412
And my mom's name is Dharti.

49:05.409 --> 49:08.481
Desh Premi has a childhood dream.

49:09.347 --> 49:11.258
To join the army...

49:11.315 --> 49:17.732
...and serve the c...c...country.

49:18.623 --> 49:21.604
But...when he was a kid...

49:22.493 --> 49:25.963
...he was struck with
p...p...paralysis.

49:26.030 --> 49:27.065
Why didn't he become a martyr?

49:27.598 --> 49:28.235
What?

49:28.699 --> 49:30.201
Sorry...you were saying something.

49:30.268 --> 49:31.542
Please go on.

49:32.536 --> 49:37.508
And since then,
he can't s...s...stand up.

49:37.575 --> 49:38.679
Stand up for what?

49:39.043 --> 49:41.023
Desh Premi cannot stand up.

49:42.279 --> 49:44.657
I completely trust your love, darling.

49:44.715 --> 49:49.095
Once you hold it... Hands.

49:50.521 --> 49:53.263
You never let go. Hands!

49:55.359 --> 49:57.134
Once we get married...

49:57.395 --> 49:59.534
...then I will automatically stand up.

50:01.399 --> 50:03.310
You two are getting married?
- Yes.

50:03.534 --> 50:05.480
Next week. In Pattaya.

50:06.404 --> 50:09.681
And by the way,
you're all invited to the wedding.

50:10.074 --> 50:11.519
It's not compulsory.

50:11.575 --> 50:13.612
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

50:14.211 --> 50:18.785
But if...you're coming,
then remember.

50:20.251 --> 50:25.132
If anyone tries to hit on my Lily...

50:25.189 --> 50:27.499
...then first I'll
thrash you like a man...

50:28.692 --> 50:30.638
...then like a hurricane...

50:31.695 --> 50:37.270
...and finally like Salman.

50:38.469 --> 50:41.313
Because once I make a commitment...

50:41.705 --> 50:45.380
...| place it on my lap and use it.

50:45.443 --> 50:47.480
What?
- My joystick.

50:47.778 --> 50:49.257

50:50.147 --> 50:52.423

54:42.346 --> 54:45.327
Thank God my mother's
name wasn't lshita.

54:45.649 --> 54:47.424
And father's name wasn't Mohan.

54:47.484 --> 54:49.157
Otherwise instead of U R Ashit...

54:49.219 --> 54:51.062
...my name would've been I M Ashit.

54:51.121 --> 54:53.328
Bang! Bang!

54:54.258 --> 54:57.432
Why does he keep saying "Bang" "Bang"?

54:57.494 --> 55:00.100
I'll tell you.
- Tell them Lily.

55:00.164 --> 55:00.608
Hi.

55:00.664 --> 55:02.644
While playing his army roles...

55:02.700 --> 55:06.614
...papa has fired so
many b...b...bullets...

55:06.670 --> 55:10.709
...that sometimes he t...talks less...

55:10.974 --> 55:15.286
...and smshoots more from his mouth.

55:15.346 --> 55:17.451
Correct. Correct.

55:17.614 --> 55:20.026
You didn't introduce
me to your guests.

55:20.317 --> 55:21.159
Sorry. PaPa-

55:21.218 --> 55:23.129
This is Sunny and that's Aditya.

55:23.153 --> 55:24.154
Hello. Hello.

55:24.555 --> 55:29.470
You know that
sex-addic...addic...group..

55:29.526 --> 55:31.472
...that Laila and I run.

55:32.263 --> 55:33.264
These two are members.

55:33.330 --> 55:35.674
These two have a sex problem.
- Yes.

55:35.732 --> 55:38.713
You know that I hate sex,
and I hate sex-addicts.

55:38.769 --> 55:39.770
No, no, no...

55:40.037 --> 55:42.381
I would make all the sex-addicts...

55:42.439 --> 55:45.045
...stand in a line and
"bang...bang...bang."

55:45.108 --> 55:46.143
Shoot them.

55:46.210 --> 55:48.554
No, no...we were sex-addicts.

55:48.612 --> 55:49.784
Not anymore.

55:50.013 --> 55:52.459
Your daughter treated us so well...

55:52.516 --> 55:54.189
...we stopped having sex.

55:54.251 --> 55:55.127
We even stopped thinking about it.

55:55.185 --> 55:57.187
Good. Good.

55:59.289 --> 56:00.097
Good. Good.

56:00.157 --> 56:02.296
By the way, sir...
that's really nice horse.

56:02.459 --> 56:03.631
What's his name?
- Blackie.

56:03.694 --> 56:04.229
Yes.

56:04.295 --> 56:05.035
Blackie?

56:05.629 --> 56:06.607
But sir, he's white.

56:06.664 --> 56:10.043
Bahadur Shah Zafar once
said "What is in the name".

56:10.534 --> 56:11.035
Yes, sir.

56:11.101 --> 56:14.241
But...Shakespeare said that,
and not Bahadur Shah.

56:14.304 --> 56:16.477
Exactly. "What is in the name".

56:19.043 --> 56:20.386
Come...|'|| show you the back...

56:20.444 --> 56:21.684
I mean the backside.
- Whose?

56:21.745 --> 56:23.053
Of the hotel, of course.

56:25.983 --> 56:28.088
Welcome. Welcome to the Wedding Hotel.

56:28.152 --> 56:30.223
You were taking us to the backside.

56:30.287 --> 56:31.357
But this is the poolside.

56:33.490 --> 56:36.528
Hello, boys.

56:48.605 --> 56:51.415
And you are?
- I am his son-das (Shit).

56:51.475 --> 56:53.751
What? You're his son-das (Shit)?

56:54.011 --> 56:57.652
Yes. He's my son,
and his name's Das (Shit).

56:57.714 --> 56:58.692
So...Son Das (Shit).

57:00.617 --> 57:02.153
He's always shaking it around.

57:02.186 --> 57:03.563
What?
- His brush.

57:05.088 --> 57:06.590
He has quite manly hobbies?

57:07.157 --> 57:08.602
Yes...and men are my hobby.

57:11.328 --> 57:15.333
I love...filling up my big canvas...

57:15.365 --> 57:21.008
...with my long brush strokes.

57:22.439 --> 57:25.579
Would you...like to see mine?
- What?

57:26.477 --> 57:29.151
Canvas!
- Of course.

57:29.179 --> 57:29.987
Of course.

57:31.148 --> 57:32.650
Naughty b0)!-

57:33.250 --> 57:34.024
See..

57:34.084 --> 57:35.688
Beautiful.

57:36.186 --> 57:40.066
A poor fly...
is stuck in a spider's web.

57:42.592 --> 57:43.730
Woosh! Woosh!

57:43.994 --> 57:46.270
It flew away.

57:51.702 --> 57:54.182
Hi, sister!

58:10.721 --> 58:15.363
"A|| night long
everyone stares at you."

58:16.460 --> 58:18.963
Why did she have
to be like her mother?

58:19.029 --> 58:19.973
Seema.

58:43.086 --> 58:46.693
If you want...
you can drink this milk too.

58:48.525 --> 58:49.629
It's cold.

58:50.527 --> 58:51.562
It's fresh.

58:52.362 --> 58:54.273
And filled with cream.

58:56.200 --> 58:59.306
So much cream...isn't good for me.

59:00.704 --> 59:02.342
Ouch...

59:02.406 --> 59:03.441
Oh my, God.

59:04.341 --> 59:08.653
No one poked me so hard...
even on Facebook.

59:08.679 --> 59:10.317
Once more.
- Sorry.

59:10.380 --> 59:13.657
But...my bag's handle
poked you by mistake.

59:14.651 --> 59:16.653
l...l...wasn't talking
about the handle.

59:18.188 --> 59:20.065
I can't handle it anymore.

59:21.692 --> 59:24.298
Now mine's...stuck.

59:24.361 --> 59:26.272
"With the winds..."

59:26.330 --> 59:28.037
"...and the clouds."

59:28.165 --> 59:30.042
"Let's move O Beloved."

59:30.167 --> 59:32.113
Das. Das.
- No, no, no.

59:33.337 --> 59:35.044
Enough of this nok-jok-and poke.

59:35.105 --> 59:36.209
Come with me you two.

59:36.273 --> 59:38.253
I'll show you two
your rooms in the resort.

59:38.308 --> 59:39.150
Come on, follow me.

59:39.209 --> 59:41.553
I said follow me.
- Papa.

59:46.383 --> 59:48.090
He's so hot. - He's so hot.

59:49.586 --> 59:50.564
Same pinch.

59:50.988 --> 59:54.162
After all...we both drank
the same mother's milk.

59:57.761 --> 59:59.570
I want him.
- I want him.

01:00:02.332 --> 01:00:03.777
He's mine.
- He's mine.

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:04.739
He's mine.
- He's mine.

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.071
He's mine.
- He's mine.

01:00:06.136 --> 01:00:08.548
It took us an entire day
to go from on pool to another.

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.480
After all it's a wedding hotel.

01:00:10.507 --> 01:00:11.713
Hi!

01:00:12.576 --> 01:00:15.022
What a treemcoconuts.

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:16.682
What are you two doing here?

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:18.458
You two just disappeared
after that day.

01:00:18.515 --> 01:00:19.687
Hi, Aditya.

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:21.592
Do you know these two?
- No. No.

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:23.460
No, no...
- Yes, uncle.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.228
I met these two at
the alcoholids rehab.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.600
No, no, you're mistaken.
- Yes.

01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:31.503
They're sex-addicts, and not alcohol.

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:33.302
No, no, we were..

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:36.139
We know that.
- What?

01:00:36.433 --> 01:00:38.435
After all...we took full advantage...

01:00:38.502 --> 01:00:40.345
...of that addiction that night.

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:41.041
Sir, sir...

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:43.345
Sir, we can't have anymore fun.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.181
Actually sir, we are screwed,
I mean jacked.

01:00:45.242 --> 01:00:47.279
We're tired.
- We're sleepy.

01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:48.550
Yes, come on.
- Bye.

01:00:50.781 --> 01:00:52.556
"Oh Baby."

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:55.354
Laila...what are you doing?

01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:59.257
Trying to explain you...

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:02.159
...the more you try
to be Vishwamitra...

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:06.138
...|'|| be Meneka.

01:01:06.697 --> 01:01:09.473
If I fail to break your penance...

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:15.549
...then I'll be a bachelor
for the rest of my life.

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:18.609
Laila...just say I love you once.

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:22.519
And then watch all
the fun that I give you.

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:23.614
Forget that.

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:27.624
Say Laila...Give-it to me.

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:30.597
No!

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:32.291
Say it, Sunny.

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:34.226
Laila...Give-it to me.

01:01:34.391 --> 01:01:35.597
Sunny, say it.

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:40.071
Laila...Give-it to me.

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:44.540
Sunny...Sunny...give it to her.

01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:47.343
If you don't...then I will.

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:51.482
Not just me...entire
Pattaya will give it to her.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:54.488
But for Gods sake,
take your hands off...

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.319
...from my room's intercom button.

01:01:56.346 --> 01:01:58.656
So that I can peacefully
sleep alone in my room.

01:02:01.618 --> 01:02:02.596
One.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.559
Desh Premi...march ahead.

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:07.399
We're with you.

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:10.131
Why's that old man
and that wheel-chair guy...

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:13.766
mexercising in
the middle of the day?

01:02:14.998 --> 01:02:17.376
I guess you like bamboos.

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:20.010
But sir, what are you preparing for...

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.549
...in the middle of the day?

01:02:21.605 --> 01:02:24.085
The Ancestral games of our family.

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:25.684
The Wedding Games.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.278
The Wedding Games? Ooh!

01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:28.455
What are these wedding games?

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:31.651
It's a huge competition.

01:02:31.715 --> 01:02:35.253
From paintball...to tug-of-war.

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:38.493
And now...get ready for the war.

01:02:39.656 --> 01:02:40.498
Let's go.

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:42.202
Go on.

01:02:51.568 --> 01:02:52.603
Pull.

01:02:58.308 --> 01:02:59.412
Yeah!

01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:06.360
‘Dharti Maa...
Give me strength!‘

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:20.333
Thank you, God.

01:03:20.397 --> 01:03:21.432
Thank you, God.

01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:23.669
No...Mama!

01:03:24.701 --> 01:03:25.509
That was fun.

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:28.139
Lily...come here.

01:03:28.238 --> 01:03:29.376
Lily, come here!

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:31.544
Come here.
- Coming.

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:48.325
We should play something different.

01:03:48.725 --> 01:03:50.602
Like?
- Kabaddi.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.765
You will play kabaddi?
- Yeah.

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:55.635
So I can say "De Chaddi-
De Chaddi- De Chaddi.. (Underwear)"

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:57.235
Leave me.
- "De Chaddi- De Chaddi (Underwear)"

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:58.404
"Take mine..."

01:03:58.468 --> 01:03:59.378
Get lost.

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:06.486
No...no...

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:08.018
Now it's your turn.

01:04:08.078 --> 01:04:08.453
Go!

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:09.216
Okay.

01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:13.059
Missed.

01:04:14.384 --> 01:04:15.055
Come on.

01:04:15.118 --> 01:04:16.062
Come on, buck up.

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:18.090
Yes, come on.

01:04:20.724 --> 01:04:22.226
Come on. Come on.

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:24.300
Come on, Sunny.

01:06:03.026 --> 01:06:04.664
If the peacock dances in the jungle...

01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:06.071
...who saw it?

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:07.540
N0. no. no, no.

01:06:08.031 --> 01:06:10.637
Don't shoot...Don't shoot.

01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:21.352
Oh my, God.

01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:26.121
Take your gun and
make holes in my body.

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:28.423
Colour my body...

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:31.557
O beloved...
shoot me with your water-gun.

01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:32.599
Let my Sunny go.

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:35.499
You two brother-sister...
have made my life hell.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.706
This is all your fault.
- What?

01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:40.372
You...

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:45.308
You're my sister...
but Sunny's my bed.

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:56.079
Sorry.

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:05.099
"lam A-Shit."

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:09.332
"lam A-Shit."

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:15.701
No, no, no, no...

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:20.681
"lam A-Shit."

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:29.689
Oh, God!

01:07:32.983 --> 01:07:35.190
That handicap broke my kneecaps.

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:38.224
We should've played
hopscotch with him instead.

01:07:38.288 --> 01:07:40.768
And that cripple would've
beat us in that too.

01:07:41.024 --> 01:07:42.526
The worst thing is...

01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:45.232
...he humiliated me in front of Lily.

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:47.733
How will we ever get married now?

01:07:48.464 --> 01:07:49.534
Yeah...

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:51.270
I've an idea.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:53.138
Go and tell Lily...

01:07:53.503 --> 01:07:56.279
...that you intentionally
lost to Desh Premi.

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:57.750
So that she doesn't feel bad.

01:07:59.042 --> 01:08:00.715
Nice idea.
- Good idea, right?

01:08:00.977 --> 01:08:02.047
I'll go find her.

01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:08.689
Where's Lily's room?

01:08:08.952 --> 01:08:10.488
Lily's room...

01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:13.258
I am very sorry.

01:08:13.323 --> 01:08:14.996
I mistakenly banged you.

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:19.270
I want you to keep banging into me.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.246
Leave me. Laila.

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:33.353
Leave me.

01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:35.648
It's not Laila,
I am your loverboy.

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:37.615
Das.
- Yeah, Das.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.421
Now let's get down with this Das.

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:40.460
How did you get in?

01:08:40.515 --> 01:08:43.053
You know I'm an expert in getting in.

01:08:43.353 --> 01:08:46.698
I offered something hard
to the house-keeping boy.

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:47.700
Hard what?

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:51.999
Hard cash...so I can kiss your lips.

01:08:52.095 --> 01:08:53.335
Oh, God!

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:55.535
You know, I have just one problem.

01:08:55.999 --> 01:09:00.448
If I don't drink something,
it drives me crazy.

01:09:00.502 --> 01:09:04.314
Lipple.
- Naughty boy..

01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:07.582
|...|...| didn't mean that.

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:09.590
You know those milk-bottles for kids.

01:09:09.612 --> 01:09:12.593
It's got that lipple...
and milk comes out of it.

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:15.185
You can suck that.

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:18.095
It will fulfil your
needs and desires too.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:20.964
Did you ever suck...a lipple?

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:22.301
A lot.

01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:23.269
Since I was a kid.

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:25.697
It's really fun.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:28.138
Then let's do it together.

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.042
It will be so much fun.

01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:32.671
I know...

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:38.011
Go to your room...
and keep your lipple ready.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:42.988
I'll be there shortly...
and do it with you.

01:09:46.216 --> 01:09:47.194
Okay. We-

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:50.630
Look, Das...you see...
I'm really hurt today.

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.529
That's why I brought it along.

01:09:52.589 --> 01:09:54.466
What?
- Ointment.

01:09:57.494 --> 01:09:59.997
The ointment of my
love on your wounds.

01:10:00.063 --> 01:10:00.700
Oh, God.

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:04.673
Ouch...let me take it out of my pouch.

01:10:08.171 --> 01:10:11.618
These wounds on your handsome body...

01:10:11.675 --> 01:10:14.417
...is like the blemishes on the moon.

01:10:14.444 --> 01:10:15.718
Look, Das...look...

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:18.691
Someone might come in...
and see us.

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:20.091
Go to your room.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:22.389
Go to your room.
- Fine.

01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:23.396
|am going.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:27.695
But promise me...you will come.

01:10:27.757 --> 01:10:30.738
|...|...| will come!

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.730
Come...

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:36.468
And if you don't come,
I'll make you come.

01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:37.569
Okay. I'll come.

01:10:37.634 --> 01:10:39.580
Go, go...

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:42.774
Before I go...
let me give you a woah-job.

01:10:42.806 --> 01:10:43.580
What?

01:10:43.673 --> 01:10:44.447
Huh!

01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:45.246
What?

01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:46.115
Disgusting...

01:10:46.176 --> 01:10:51.387
I meanmblowing on your wounds...
is my job.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:56.226
See...| can blow myself.

01:10:56.686 --> 01:10:57.756
I can blow myself.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.822
Wow! So talented!

01:11:00.056 --> 01:11:01.262
Now go...now go. Go on.

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:03.662
Get well soon.
- Go, go, go...

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:05.205
Go!

01:11:05.495 --> 01:11:06.667
Landed on my bum.

01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:08.268
I'll be waiting...

01:11:08.465 --> 01:11:09.671
Room No 69!

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:12.069
Just like the magician's heart...

01:11:12.135 --> 01:11:13.443
...is trapped in the parrot.

01:11:13.503 --> 01:11:15.449
Similarly, Ashit's heart...

01:11:15.505 --> 01:11:17.416
...is in his horse Blackie.

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:21.080
And today...l'm going to bathe him.

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.188
Clean him...

01:11:23.246 --> 01:11:26.386
And make him so spotless...

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:29.453
...that old man will
make me sit on this horse...

01:11:29.519 --> 01:11:30.759
...and make me Lily's groom.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:31.589
Bang!

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:33.600
Zip your pants first,
it's been open since morning.

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:35.567
Sorry...it's this bloody pant..

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:36.603
Bravo!

01:11:38.328 --> 01:11:40.365
Stand up, Desh Premi! Stand up.

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:42.273
You have to fulfil my dreams.

01:11:42.332 --> 01:11:44.539
You've to fight a war for the country.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.773
Papa...why are you
troubling my body...

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:49.141
...for his dreams.

01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:50.650
So that you can be a man.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.220
Pick up my gun, be a man.

01:11:53.276 --> 01:11:57.656
I just want to have
fun with a man's gun.

01:11:58.114 --> 01:11:59.286
Bang!

01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:01.226
Good boy, Blackie.

01:12:01.517 --> 01:12:03.190
Good boy, Blackie.

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:06.330
He's been smacking
my face with his tail.

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:07.697
You should be thankful
that he isn't kicking you.

01:12:07.757 --> 01:12:08.531
Come on.

01:12:08.591 --> 01:12:11.071
Please, Sunny. Hold his tail.

01:12:11.127 --> 01:12:12.504
Please.
- Fine, I will.

01:12:12.762 --> 01:12:14.298
I'll clean his behind.

01:12:14.364 --> 01:12:15.308
Blackie.

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:18.176
Your zip's still open. Yuck!

01:12:19.035 --> 01:12:21.015
Then zip it up.
- No, no...| won't.

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:22.344
For the sake of our friendship.

01:12:22.405 --> 01:12:24.214
Pleasemdo it.

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:26.186
That's more like it.

01:12:26.376 --> 01:12:28.515
Oh no...the tail's stuck.

01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:29.318
What did you do?

01:12:29.379 --> 01:12:31.256
I didn't do it.
- You attached it.

01:12:31.314 --> 01:12:32.725
I tried to zip it and it got stuck.

01:12:32.782 --> 01:12:34.022
Now help me take it out.

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:34.788
OkaY-
. OIQY"

01:12:35.051 --> 01:12:36.223
OkaY-
. OIQY"

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:38.227
So exciting.

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:39.226
And you know. "Ouch!"

01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:49.473
Someone lift me up.

01:12:49.532 --> 01:12:51.102
I will.

01:12:55.338 --> 01:12:56.817
Come out. Come out.
- Come on, Blackie.

01:12:58.074 --> 01:13:00.076
Let's go.

01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:04.420
"Boy's wood."

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:05.618
"Horse on the wood."

01:13:05.682 --> 01:13:07.184
"And with a hammer..."

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:08.991
"...he struck the horse's bum."

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.321
My Blackie.

01:13:12.255 --> 01:13:13.666
Aren't you ashamed, shameless fellows?

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:17.034
You used my poor blackie...

01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:19.471
...to satisfy your hunger and lust.

01:13:19.529 --> 01:13:21.304
No, sir...you're mistaken.

01:13:21.364 --> 01:13:22.536
Yes, sir. You're mistaken.

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:25.442
We only wanted to bathe
and clean your Blackie.

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:27.378
But the tail got stuck instead.

01:13:27.437 --> 01:13:29.417
Because the zip slipped, sir.

01:13:29.472 --> 01:13:31.452
My mind's slipped now.

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:34.247
I will shoot you two with my gun.

01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:35.516
It's out! It's out! It's out!

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:37.251
Run! Run! Run!

01:13:57.333 --> 01:14:01.042
This means...he only
pretends to be a cripple.

01:14:02.472 --> 01:14:04.247
Let's go break both his legs.

01:14:05.408 --> 01:14:06.512
Not yet.

01:14:06.576 --> 01:14:08.146
We'll go back to the resort.

01:14:08.211 --> 01:14:10.248
Wait for him to return.

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:12.423
And later, we'll teach him a lesson...

01:14:12.482 --> 01:14:13.460
...in front of the entire family.

01:14:13.483 --> 01:14:13.756
Come on.

01:14:14.017 --> 01:14:15.291
Good idea. Good idea.
- Come on.

01:14:15.351 --> 01:14:17.126
"Mastizaade."

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:28.233
Sunny! Aditya! Come in.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:32.336
Bloody cripple...
how did you get here before us?

01:14:32.402 --> 01:14:35.008
I guess he ran on his two feet...

01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:37.278
...which he was using
earlier to walk...

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.752
...on Walking Street.

01:14:40.009 --> 01:14:41.147
Rascal.

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:44.157
In front of everyone,
you pretend you can't stand...

01:14:44.447 --> 01:14:47.621
...but in reality, Milkha can run.

01:14:48.117 --> 01:14:50.723
I've been sitting here for hours,
sewing our Tri-colour flag.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.322
Shut up, you imposter.

01:14:57.126 --> 01:14:58.070
Take this...

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:00.439
Come on. Come on.

01:15:06.569 --> 01:15:09.448
Stop crawling on the
ground like an insect.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:12.145
Get up...show that you can stand.

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:15.083
I can't stand up.

01:15:15.144 --> 01:15:17.317
These legs are too strong.

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.987
Give us these legs, Premi.
- No.

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:25.521
Give us these legs, Premi.
- No.

01:15:25.588 --> 01:15:31.561
Give us these legs, Premi!
- No.

01:15:31.995 --> 01:15:33.599
Come on my express train.

01:15:33.729 --> 01:15:35.731
Show the world that you can walk.

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:37.068
You can run.

01:15:37.133 --> 01:15:37.702
Go!

01:15:42.438 --> 01:15:44.042
"Dogs."

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.019
Desh Premi!

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:47.145
What happened?

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:48.210
My God.

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:50.587
Why are you beating...
my poor Desh Premi?

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:52.319
Why are you hurting this poor chap?

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:55.555
Mr. U R Ashit...this bloody
hotwheels is not helpless.

01:15:55.618 --> 01:15:57.222
He only pretends to be a cripple.

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:58.390
He can walk.

01:15:58.454 --> 01:15:59.558
They thrashed me a lot.

01:15:59.622 --> 01:16:01.465
We saw him on Walking street...

01:16:01.524 --> 01:16:05.995
...shaking a leg with naked girls.

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:07.234
You fools...

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:11.005
The guy you saw walking
at Walking Street...

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:12.341
...wasn't Desh Premi.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:14.005
It's his twin brother.

01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:18.113
Twin?
- Yes, my twin brother.

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:19.480
Desh Drohi.

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:24.491
Today I will 'bang' you
two with my double-barrel.

01:16:24.547 --> 01:16:29.223
Papa...you've to shoot
me before you shoot Sunny.

01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:31.731
Move aside, Das.
Move. Or I will shoot.

01:16:31.988 --> 01:16:33.990
No, papa.
- Move I say.

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:34.761
No, papa...
- Move.

01:16:35.024 --> 01:16:36.162
It's okay. PaPa-

01:16:36.225 --> 01:16:38.705
Anyone can m...make this mistake.

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:39.535
Yes, of course.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:41.404
They've made many mistakes today.

01:16:41.464 --> 01:16:43.603
First Blackie and now Desh Premi.

01:16:43.666 --> 01:16:45.441
I won't spare you.

01:16:45.501 --> 01:16:48.107
Papa...please...spare my love.

01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:49.616
There's nothing left to spare now.

01:16:49.672 --> 01:16:51.151
Papa...

01:16:56.712 --> 01:16:58.487
Hello.
- What are you doing?

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:01.158
I wanted to tell you that...

01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:06.030
...we knew we didn't see
your Desh Premi on Walking Street.

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:07.465
It was his twin brother.

01:17:07.523 --> 01:17:10.163
Then why create this
c...com...commotion?

01:17:10.226 --> 01:17:13.435
Darling. To help Desh Premi stand up.
- What?

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:16.102
We thought our punches will awaken...

01:17:16.332 --> 01:17:18.278
...the man inside him.

01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:21.713
And your Desh Premi will stand up.

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:25.315
Aditya, you're so sweet.
- I know.

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:27.183
"O baby."

01:17:27.243 --> 01:17:29.086
Let's get cool in the pool.

01:17:31.547 --> 01:17:34.118
"My passionate heart's saying."

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:37.062
"How long am I going
to stay lonely and yearning?"

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:40.367
"Let me shower my
love on you today..."

01:17:40.423 --> 01:17:43.370
"...and drench you."

01:17:44.193 --> 01:17:46.002
Don't worry, Blackie.

01:17:46.062 --> 01:17:48.542
Tonight I am going to keep a watch...

01:17:48.598 --> 01:17:52.136
...and no one will
be hit on you tonight.

01:17:52.568 --> 01:17:54.206
If anyone even stares at your bum...

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:55.476
...|'|| blow him up with this bomb.

01:17:55.538 --> 01:17:56.346
Bang.

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:58.043
I can do anything for your happiness.

01:17:58.241 --> 01:18:00.016
And that's why I have another idea.

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:01.186
What idea?

01:18:01.244 --> 01:18:04.282
Make that Desh Premi burn!

01:18:04.547 --> 01:18:05.651
Not actually.

01:18:06.082 --> 01:18:08.358
Make him jealous.

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:10.522
Ohh... How?

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:13.999
Pretend to love some
hot and happening hunk.

01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:16.169
First, reduce the
size of your clothes...

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:20.571
...|ike your sister...
and seduce someone else.

01:18:21.531 --> 01:18:23.704
Smaller than this?

01:18:23.966 --> 01:18:26.537
When he sees you with someone else?

01:18:26.602 --> 01:18:27.205
Yes...

01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:32.015
Your Desh Premi will
automaticallymstand up.

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:38.287
But...hot...handsome...hunk...

01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:39.655
...where do I find him?

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:42.355
Look around, you'll find him.

01:18:46.589 --> 01:18:48.694
There's no o...one around.

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:50.169
Look again.

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:51.296
Must be somewhere here or there.

01:18:54.597 --> 01:18:56.770
There's no one here or there?

01:18:57.032 --> 01:18:58.102
Then look in front of you.

01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:04.308
There's just you.

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:06.512
Then why don't you do it with me.

01:19:06.576 --> 01:19:08.556
You don't mean that.

01:19:08.611 --> 01:19:10.488
I mean it...| mean it...

01:19:10.546 --> 01:19:11.684
How else do you want me to say it?

01:19:11.948 --> 01:19:16.397
Aditya...wi|| you really...

01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:20.333
...p...p...pretend to love me?

01:19:21.624 --> 01:19:23.194
Lily.
- Yes.

01:19:23.692 --> 01:19:26.696
I'll be so realistic in this act...

01:19:28.631 --> 01:19:31.111
...that you'll forget
that I'm only pretending.

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:36.372
L...let's begin.

01:19:36.539 --> 01:19:37.244
What?

01:19:37.306 --> 01:19:40.378
The act.

01:20:03.366 --> 01:20:07.576
"A|| night long
everyone stares at you."

01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:22.324
"A|| night long
everyone stares at you."

01:20:22.385 --> 01:20:26.265
"Some whistle and some wink at you."

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:28.131
"Some ask me to come to the corner."

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:30.067
"Some call me to their home."

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:32.071
"Some say let's do it here."

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:33.766
"Everyone's crazy about you."

01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:37.704
"Now it's my choice...
what do I give to whom."

01:20:37.767 --> 01:20:41.112
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:43.146
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:45.116
"...or should I show you the picture."

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:47.085
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:20:47.143 --> 01:20:48.781
"...or should I show you the picture."

01:20:49.045 --> 01:20:50.615
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.659
"...or should I show you the picture."

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:09.342
"The night's colourful..."

01:21:09.398 --> 01:21:11.207
"...so why are you lagqiﬂq"

01:21:11.267 --> 01:21:15.147
"The candle of
love...is burning high."

01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:20.714
"It's a bit hard."

01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:22.614
"And a bit soft."

01:21:23.012 --> 01:21:26.789
"The cold nights...
making me smoulder."

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:30.720
"Let me bathe you in this moonlight."

01:21:30.786 --> 01:21:34.199
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:36.434
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:21:36.492 --> 01:21:38.301
"...or should I show you the picture."

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.362
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:21:40.429 --> 01:21:42.204
"...or should I show you the picture."

01:21:42.264 --> 01:21:44.107
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:21:44.166 --> 01:21:46.510
"...or should I show you the picture."

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:12.337
"A|| night long
everyone stares at you."

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:16.137
"Some whistle and some wink at you."

01:22:16.198 --> 01:22:18.144
"Some ask me to come to the corner."

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.077
"Some call me to their home."

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:22.046
"Some say let's do it here."

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:23.606
"Everyone's crazy about you."

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:27.449
"Now it's my choice...
what do I give to whom."

01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:31.185
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:33.089
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:35.059
"...or should I show you the picture."

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:36.790
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:22:37.052 --> 01:22:38.793
"...or should I show you the picture."

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:40.624
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:42.566
"...or should I show you the picture."

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:44.468
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:47.336
"...or should I show you the picture."

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:51.601
Last night it felt like...

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:56.582
...Lily's burning up inside for me.

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:59.118
But with me the fire
is burning on both sides.

01:22:59.508 --> 01:23:01.647
Basanti want's to steer my cart...

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:04.190
...as well as Gabbar's Sambha.

01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:06.184
Stop laughing-

01:23:06.515 --> 01:23:10.258
That Das has been giving
me scary nightmares.

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:14.563
Like...l'm a fly
stuck in his spider-web.

01:23:16.125 --> 01:23:18.401
No! No! No!

01:23:20.296 --> 01:23:22.401
Das. No.

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:23.602
No.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:27.405
Now you're stuck.

01:23:29.138 --> 01:23:30.481
Smell this.

01:23:32.208 --> 01:23:33.380
Now listen to my problem.

01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:34.580
Whenever Lily comes close to me...

01:23:34.643 --> 01:23:36.213
...her father get's upset.

01:23:36.312 --> 01:23:39.589
Now I must convince the father,
along with his daughter.

01:23:39.648 --> 01:23:40.592
Impossible.

01:23:40.649 --> 01:23:41.491
How do I do it?

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:44.186
We must think of something.

01:23:44.587 --> 01:23:46.328
Anyway, go take a bath.

01:23:46.388 --> 01:23:48.766
I'll go get a towel.
- Go on, hurry up.

01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:56.733
Careful Mr. Kele.

01:23:56.799 --> 01:24:01.009
Because coming your way is Laila Lele.

01:24:05.107 --> 01:24:06.245
You haven't taken a bath yet.

01:24:06.308 --> 01:24:07.616
No, I was taking a dump...

01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:10.119
Tell me how do I
convince that old man?

01:24:10.179 --> 01:24:11.351
Give him a gift.

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:14.288
Like an expensive perfume.
Or body lotion.

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:17.086
Like the one I use...it's really nice.

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:19.496
Yuck...mine's better.

01:24:19.688 --> 01:24:22.259
No, no, look at mine. Mine's better.

01:24:22.992 --> 01:24:24.596
Why is yours better than me?

01:24:25.327 --> 01:24:27.307
Look...mine's bigger!

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:31.442
They're going to blow you
away with their cannon, sir.

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:32.604
No! No! No!
- Yes, sir.

01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:33.738
You don't get it.

01:24:34.336 --> 01:24:36.509
When we give it to the old man...

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:38.279
...he should feel good.

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:40.183
Shameless. Give me.

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:42.518
And when he squeezes it out...

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:43.716
...and applies it all over his body...

01:24:43.779 --> 01:24:46.123
Shameless...l'll apply it on my body.

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:47.683
He should feel completely refreshing.

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:48.558
Oh...

01:24:48.617 --> 01:24:51.097
And that's why mine's better.

01:24:51.353 --> 01:24:53.230
Disgusting. You're disgusting.

01:24:53.322 --> 01:24:53.732
Disgusting.

01:24:53.789 --> 01:24:54.563
Okay, fine.

01:24:54.623 --> 01:24:57.570
Tonight we'll give the old man yours.
- Yes.

01:24:58.427 --> 01:24:59.633
Tonight!

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:03.710
They don't want your daughter...

01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:06.504
...they want you.

01:25:06.568 --> 01:25:08.070
Oh, God!

01:25:08.137 --> 01:25:10.048
Disgusting people. Let's go.

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:11.049
Boys.

01:25:13.509 --> 01:25:14.544
Oh my.

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:16.416
Honey!

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:33.265

Meet my friend Steve.

01:25:41.036 --> 01:25:42.174
Hi.

01:25:42.705 --> 01:25:45.447
Listen, I want you

01:25:45.507 --> 01:25:46.747
Hi.

01:25:47.576 --> 01:25:49.715
I want you to meet my friend Rajeev.

01:25:49.778 --> 01:25:52.486

01:25:55.217 --> 01:25:56.287
No!

01:26:04.226 --> 01:26:05.500
Now there's just one way left.

01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:08.437
In order to make Sunny mine...

01:26:09.031 --> 01:26:13.377
...|'|| have to do

"O my sweet be|oved.."

01:26:38.327 --> 01:26:40.603
"O my sweet be|oved.."

"|'ve decked up for you..."

01:26:43.098 --> 01:26:45.305
"Only for you."

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:47.608
"|'ve changed myself only for you."

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:49.774
"Now listen to my heartbeats."

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:56.284
"Every corner...corner of my heart."

01:26:56.345 --> 01:26:58.689
"This Laila belongs only to Sunny."

01:26:58.747 --> 01:27:01.057
"This Laila belongs only to Sunny."

01:27:01.116 --> 01:27:03.255
"This Laila belongs only to Sunny."

01:27:03.318 --> 01:27:05.525
"This Laila belongs only to Sunny."

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:07.965
"This Laila belongs only to Sunny."

01:27:08.023 --> 01:27:11.232

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:22.545
He's shaking it too. His head.

01:27:23.438 --> 01:27:30.549
Listen...there's something
I want to say to you...

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:38.691
...from the bottom of my heart,
with faith and sanctity.

01:27:40.155 --> 01:27:41.099
I love you.

01:27:41.156 --> 01:27:43.397
I love you too.

01:27:50.499 --> 01:27:51.409
Let go, dear.

01:27:51.467 --> 01:27:53.003
What nonsense.

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:57.049
My heart's broken but not my bangles.

01:27:59.274 --> 01:28:00.651
Yuck...Mummy

01:28:02.344 --> 01:28:08.351

Lily dearmgood news. Good news.

01:28:36.611 --> 01:28:38.181
Desh Premi, give them the good news.

01:28:38.247 --> 01:28:39.988
I just received my doctor's report.

01:28:40.415 --> 01:28:43.419
Remember...you bent down, aimed...

01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:46.295
...and punched me in a special place.

01:28:46.355 --> 01:28:47.698
Yeah...

01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:51.098
That's to those punches,
all my veins are unblocked again.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:52.467
Huh?

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:55.267
Now the blood's circulating
in the right place.

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:58.777
No, no...l am still a cripple.
- Good.

01:28:59.034 --> 01:29:00.342
But...below the knee.

01:29:00.569 --> 01:29:02.207
All the parts above the knee...

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:04.181
...are functioning perfectly.

01:29:04.573 --> 01:29:05.643
No!

01:29:05.707 --> 01:29:07.243
Yes.

01:29:07.309 --> 01:29:10.381
This meansmtomorrow
at my wedding night...

01:29:10.445 --> 01:29:14.188
...| can easily fulfil the
responsibilities of a husband.

01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:15.460
Thanks to you.

01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:16.461
Bang.

01:29:16.518 --> 01:29:18.020
Lily, shall we?
- Yes.

01:29:18.086 --> 01:29:18.621
Come, come, come.

01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:19.688
Come on.
- Lily.

01:29:19.955 --> 01:29:24.028
Lily, I will definitely drink
almond milk on our wedding night.

01:29:24.092 --> 01:29:25.469
I definitely will.

01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:28.300
How can punches unblock the veins?

01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:31.173
|...| know Lily loves me.

01:29:31.233 --> 01:29:35.181
So why...is she marrying Desh Premi?

01:29:35.537 --> 01:29:41.317
Becausemshe doesn't want
to be unfair with Desh Premi...

01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:45.620
...|ike our libidinous
mother did to our father.

01:29:45.647 --> 01:29:48.526
What's that?

01:29:49.151 --> 01:29:50.994
Sex-addict, honey.

01:29:51.053 --> 01:29:52.361
When you speak in Hindi, baby...

01:29:52.588 --> 01:29:53.362
"O Baby."

01:29:53.589 --> 01:29:55.000
...you look like a doll.

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:56.364
Baby doll.

01:29:57.592 --> 01:30:00.038
Meaning... child doll.

01:30:03.365 --> 01:30:06.278
Stop your love
gamesmand help me out...

01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:07.506
...or keep eating that banana?

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.218
Idea.

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:16.582
There's only man who can help us.

01:30:17.279 --> 01:30:20.192
Remember our super-cool friend...

01:30:21.049 --> 01:30:23.427
...with whom we used
to have grand fun.

01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:29.429
Aur-Gasm hermitage.

01:30:29.658 --> 01:30:31.501
Wasn't this supposed
to be Deep's Night Club?

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:33.198
One Night Stand.

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:34.239
Where did this hermitage come from?

01:30:34.296 --> 01:30:35.172
How would I know?

01:30:35.230 --> 01:30:38.109
The Baba of all Babas.

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:46.711
Baba Gasm is arriving.

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:49.187
Hail Baba Gasm!

01:30:49.244 --> 01:30:52.054
Hail Baba Gasm!
- "Mastizaade."

01:30:52.114 --> 01:30:53.593
Hail Baba Gasm!

01:30:53.649 --> 01:30:56.653
"Mastizaade."
- Hail Baba Gasm!

01:30:57.219 --> 01:30:59.290
"Mastizaade."

01:31:16.104 --> 01:31:19.608
"When it comes to having fun..."

01:31:19.675 --> 01:31:23.714
"When it comes to having fun..."

01:31:23.778 --> 01:31:27.316
"...we're cut above the rest."

01:31:27.382 --> 01:31:28.759
Deep...what's wrong with you?

01:31:29.284 --> 01:31:31.230
You were the original Mastizaada.

01:31:31.286 --> 01:31:32.594
When did you become Baba Gasm?

01:31:32.654 --> 01:31:35.567
Without touching their body,
I use my mental strength...

01:31:35.624 --> 01:31:39.037
...to give mind-gasm to females.

01:31:39.094 --> 01:31:40.767
Hold on. Mind-gasm?

01:31:41.029 --> 01:31:41.598
Yes.

01:31:42.197 --> 01:31:43.540
What's mind-gasm?

01:31:44.566 --> 01:31:46.273
Guruji, mind...

01:31:46.635 --> 01:31:50.515
...'beeps' his devotees.

01:31:51.373 --> 01:31:52.716
Mind-beep.

01:31:53.141 --> 01:31:56.281
Silly boysmcome, let me demonstrate.

01:32:19.134 --> 01:32:21.080
Mind-gasm.

01:32:21.436 --> 01:32:24.076
So...what will you come?

01:32:24.139 --> 01:32:26.141
It's all Lily's mom Seema's fault.

01:32:26.208 --> 01:32:28.552
If she hadn't cheated
her father U R Ashit...

01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:31.352
...then she wouldn't
be marrying Desh Premi.

01:32:32.113 --> 01:32:34.059
U R Ashit?

01:32:35.784 --> 01:32:37.525
"Yummy Mummy."

01:32:37.586 --> 01:32:39.395
"Yummy Mummy."

01:32:39.454 --> 01:32:42.060
"Yummy Yummy Mummy."

01:32:42.124 --> 01:32:43.068
What are you doing here?

01:32:43.125 --> 01:32:44.069
You are...

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:48.172
l...seek refuge in Baba's company.

01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:52.807
For years he's been mind-'beeping' me.

01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:54.803
Seema...Seema...

01:32:55.170 --> 01:32:58.344
It's time that you
go meet your daughters.

01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:01.212
I wish I could've
helped you some more.

01:33:01.276 --> 01:33:04.086
But unfortunately...
my special appearance ends here.

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:06.022
So why don't you guys just"
- Beep-off.

01:33:06.081 --> 01:33:06.684
Exactly.

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:07.617
And yes...

01:33:07.682 --> 01:33:08.387
As soon as you get to the alter...

01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:09.292
...don't forget to shout.

01:33:09.351 --> 01:33:13.265
Stop...This marriage cannot happen.

01:33:13.321 --> 01:33:15.426
This marriage cannot happen.

01:33:15.523 --> 01:33:16.593
"Cannot happen."

01:33:16.625 --> 01:33:17.330
Seema!

01:33:17.392 --> 01:33:18.234
Mom.

01:33:18.427 --> 01:33:19.235
Mother.

01:33:19.294 --> 01:33:20.534
Mother-in-law's here.

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:21.266
Mom!

01:33:23.098 --> 01:33:25.135
"Mastizaade."

01:33:26.501 --> 01:33:28.742
"Mastizaade."

01:33:31.139 --> 01:33:32.209
What are you doing here?

01:33:32.274 --> 01:33:36.051
All thanks to Sunny
and Aditya who found me.

01:33:36.111 --> 01:33:38.682
I should've shot you two on day one.

01:33:38.747 --> 01:33:39.589
Bang.

01:33:39.648 --> 01:33:42.652
A husband's duty
is to please his wife.

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:43.559
Huh!

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:46.394
And you...never gave
me something 'beep'.

01:33:49.090 --> 01:33:52.230
And that's why...every man here...

01:33:52.727 --> 01:33:55.105
...has seen my bedroom ceiling.

01:33:55.664 --> 01:33:58.235
Tell me...who were my lovers?

01:33:58.300 --> 01:33:59.370
Tell me.

01:34:00.568 --> 01:34:01.569
Bloody priest.

01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:04.450
"Yummy Mummy."

01:34:04.506 --> 01:34:06.042
"Yummy Mummy."

01:34:06.508 --> 01:34:09.387
"Yummy Yummy Mummy."

01:34:12.147 --> 01:34:13.649
Do you want your lovers...

01:34:13.715 --> 01:34:18.562
...to raise their hands
at your daughter's wedding?

01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:19.189
No!

01:34:19.254 --> 01:34:21.291
Run away, dear. Run away.

01:34:24.693 --> 01:34:26.434
No!

01:34:26.695 --> 01:34:29.301
Laila.

01:34:42.744 --> 01:34:44.553
You dog!

01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:51.326
Quickly. Quickly.

01:34:51.586 --> 01:34:52.758
Stop.

01:34:53.788 --> 01:34:55.597
You Dog.

01:34:55.657 --> 01:34:57.159
Rascal.

01:34:59.227 --> 01:35:00.069
Hurry UP-

01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:02.540
Please stop.

01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:10.645
Sunny, I love you.

01:35:10.705 --> 01:35:12.013
Shut up, Das.

01:35:12.073 --> 01:35:13.450
Stop!

01:35:13.508 --> 01:35:14.987
Stop!

01:35:21.383 --> 01:35:22.555
Stop!

p...p...p|ease...g...g...go!

01:35:42.604 --> 01:35:44.515
Why are you walking in slow-motion?

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:47.044
Move out...or pass out.

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:54.321
Come on, fast.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

01:35:54.382 --> 01:35:55.759
Come on...move.

01:35:57.452 --> 01:35:58.226
Selfie.

01:35:58.286 --> 01:35:59.230
Selfie.

01:35:59.287 --> 01:36:00.459
Selfie.

01:36:00.522 --> 01:36:02.160
Selfie at this age.

01:36:02.224 --> 01:36:04.568
Why don't you two make out here?

01:36:04.626 --> 01:36:05.730
Mom, selfie.

01:36:05.994 --> 01:36:06.734
Smile, mom.

01:36:07.329 --> 01:36:08.205
What's going on here?

01:36:08.263 --> 01:36:09.401
Someone get them out.

01:36:09.464 --> 01:36:11.341
Why don't you hold it and get off?

01:36:11.399 --> 01:36:12.537
What did you say?

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.672
I mean...get down and catch them.

01:36:15.737 --> 01:36:16.477
Oh yeah...

01:36:16.538 --> 01:36:18.518
Oh yes, I didn't think about that.

01:36:18.573 --> 01:36:19.984
Why you...

01:36:26.481 --> 01:36:28.518
Stop. Stop.

01:36:32.487 --> 01:36:34.330
Stop. Stop.

01:36:34.389 --> 01:36:38.531
Rascalmout to dirty my Laila.

01:36:39.394 --> 01:36:43.467
Desh Premi...Aditya's my true...p...p...
- Parrot.

01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:47.445
P...p...
- Paresh Rawal.

01:36:47.502 --> 01:36:49.539
No...my true love.

01:36:51.139 --> 01:36:52.243
Papa. Papa.

01:36:52.307 --> 01:36:54.014
Aditya.
- No!

01:36:55.377 --> 01:36:56.014
Leave me.

01:36:56.077 --> 01:36:57.613
For God's sake leave me.

01:36:57.679 --> 01:37:01.126
Leave me...or else
I will kill all of you.

01:37:01.349 --> 01:37:04.489
If you kill me,
you'll become a widower.

01:37:04.552 --> 01:37:04.962
Yes.

01:37:05.019 --> 01:37:05.963
And everyone will say.

01:37:06.021 --> 01:37:08.092
Look there goes Ashit widower.

01:37:08.156 --> 01:37:09.567
A-shit widower. A-shit widower.

01:37:09.624 --> 01:37:11.501
A-shit widower.

01:37:13.228 --> 01:37:14.639
MY Quﬁ- My gun.

01:37:14.696 --> 01:37:17.040
Papa's gun is very important for him.

01:37:17.098 --> 01:37:19.009
Let's go. Let's go.

01:37:21.469 --> 01:37:22.311
Hey.

01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:24.111
Aditya!
- Fall down.

01:37:32.113 --> 01:37:33.217
I'm stuck.

01:37:36.417 --> 01:37:37.691
lam stuck.

01:37:38.019 --> 01:37:39.692
Choo! Choo! Choo!

01:37:39.754 --> 01:37:41.131
Choo!

01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:42.759
Ch...Ch...Ch00!

01:37:43.725 --> 01:37:46.467
Chooha...rat glue.

01:37:46.528 --> 01:37:48.769
Sticky-sticky gum
on brother-in-law's bum.

01:37:49.097 --> 01:37:51.168
Now he's stuck.
- Shut up.

01:37:51.232 --> 01:37:52.472
MY Qun.

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:55.036
No...
- Leave me.

01:37:55.103 --> 01:37:56.207
Lily.

01:37:59.374 --> 01:38:00.444
Leave me.

01:38:02.177 --> 01:38:03.315
MY Qun.

01:38:28.169 --> 01:38:29.546
My moustache is stuck.

01:38:29.604 --> 01:38:31.174
Ouch!

01:38:34.476 --> 01:38:36.615
My moustache.

01:38:36.678 --> 01:38:40.455
You ruined my moustache, you dog.

01:38:40.515 --> 01:38:42.119
Lily.

01:38:46.421 --> 01:38:48.765
Oh...don't look here.

01:38:49.023 --> 01:38:50.058
No.

01:39:01.436 --> 01:39:03.416
"Killed us."

01:39:05.974 --> 01:39:08.113
Now we're dead. Danger.

01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:11.549
It's like...after sticking-picking...

01:39:11.613 --> 01:39:13.650
...comes dicing and slicing.

01:39:13.715 --> 01:39:17.663
Like after catch-catch...
comes cutting to pieces.

01:39:17.719 --> 01:39:20.256
Or after girl on girl,
comes girl on boy.

01:39:20.321 --> 01:39:20.992
Shut up!

01:39:21.055 --> 01:39:23.729
Can't you guys rhyme with the time.

01:39:23.992 --> 01:39:25.562
Look there...think of an idea.

01:39:25.627 --> 01:39:28.039
Otherwise our carrots will get diced.

01:39:28.096 --> 01:39:30.201
Mother-in-law, think of an idea.

01:39:30.264 --> 01:39:32.369
Son, how can I think of an idea?

01:39:32.433 --> 01:39:35.039
Only thing I'm good
at is taking off my clothes.

01:39:35.103 --> 01:39:36.309
Oh yes...that's it.

01:39:36.371 --> 01:39:37.748
Take your clothes off.

01:39:38.673 --> 01:39:40.675
If we strip off our clothes...

01:39:40.742 --> 01:39:43.052
...we can make a rope,
lasso the lever...

01:39:43.111 --> 01:39:45.250
...and stop the machine.

01:39:45.313 --> 01:39:46.189
Yes...

01:39:46.247 --> 01:39:47.351
Shameless...

01:39:47.415 --> 01:39:49.224
Even when we're dying...

01:39:49.284 --> 01:39:51.264
...you want my family
to strip their clothes.

01:39:51.319 --> 01:39:53.230
Sir, looking at this problem...

01:39:53.287 --> 01:39:55.130
...we have to strip, please.

01:39:56.724 --> 01:39:58.704
Honey, how can I take off my blouse?

01:39:58.759 --> 01:40:00.568
What's the point of a blouse...

01:40:00.628 --> 01:40:02.266
...that can't save his spouse?

01:40:11.039 --> 01:40:12.484
Give it. Give it.

01:40:15.543 --> 01:40:17.181
Hurry...

01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:22.055
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:24.286
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:40:24.352 --> 01:40:26.059
"...or should I show you the picture."

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.724
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:40:27.788 --> 01:40:29.631
"...or should I show you the picture."
- Hurry up...hurry...

01:40:29.691 --> 01:40:31.602
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:40:31.659 --> 01:40:34.538
"...or should I show
you the picture."

01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:38.233
Hurry up...hurry...

01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:05.760
Finally.

01:41:07.028 --> 01:41:08.371
Leave him.

01:41:09.531 --> 01:41:13.445
Sir...if you still think...

01:41:14.235 --> 01:41:15.680
...we're not worthy of then,
we'll leave.

01:41:16.404 --> 01:41:17.314
Empty-handed.

01:41:18.473 --> 01:41:20.077
But before we go...

01:41:20.141 --> 01:41:22.212
...how did you get your
moustache back, Desh Premi?

01:41:24.512 --> 01:41:27.288
Ohhh...

01:41:33.021 --> 01:41:34.557
Let me go, Premi.

01:41:35.323 --> 01:41:40.136
I cannot |...|...|ive without Aditya.

01:41:40.194 --> 01:41:41.673
Let me go, father.

01:41:41.729 --> 01:41:44.767
I cannot live without Sunny.

01:41:50.038 --> 01:41:54.384
Go Lilly...go.

01:41:54.442 --> 01:42:01.223
No one can love you
more than this boy.

01:42:01.282 --> 01:42:03.353
Go.

01:42:03.418 --> 01:42:07.093
Go Lilly...go.

01:42:07.989 --> 01:42:10.128
She's gone. Bang.

01:42:10.191 --> 01:42:11.636
What are you saying?
- Yeah.

01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:14.229
In this lifetime, he's yours.

01:42:14.295 --> 01:42:17.538
But for the next six lifetimes,
Sunny's only mine.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.241
What a disgusting kid?

01:42:21.302 --> 01:42:23.748
He's yours after all.
- Bang.

01:42:24.739 --> 01:42:25.581
Bang.

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:29.611
Suck this...l...l...lipple.

01:42:34.015 --> 01:42:37.053
Years later I am seeing yours.

01:42:41.689 --> 01:42:44.568
If the coin moves...you pass.

01:42:47.094 --> 01:42:50.701
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:42:50.765 --> 01:42:52.711
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:42:52.767 --> 01:42:54.405
"...or should I show
you the picture."

01:42:54.469 --> 01:42:56.380
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:42:56.437 --> 01:42:58.383
"...or should I show
you the picture."

01:42:58.572 --> 01:43:00.051
"Sweetheart,
would you like to see the trailer..."

01:43:00.108 --> 01:43:02.213
"...or should I show
you the picture."

01:43:10.151 --> 01:43:13.325
Now mine's... trickled.

01:43:18.359 --> 01:43:22.239
"Come on everybody."

01:43:22.296 --> 01:43:25.072
"Scene 27, take 1...best of |uck."

01:43:29.437 --> 01:43:31.246
"The heart's a rascal."

01:43:31.305 --> 01:43:35.151
"Wants you to come
meet me in a closed room."

01:43:35.209 --> 01:43:38.315
"Fulfil my desires."

01:43:39.047 --> 01:43:42.051
"The heart's a rascal."

01:43:42.316 --> 01:43:45.354
"Wants you to come
meet me in a closed room."

01:43:45.787 --> 01:43:48.666
"Fulfil my desires."

01:43:49.157 --> 01:43:50.795
"Lawmarfs right here."

01:43:51.059 --> 01:43:52.697
"Where do you think you're going?"

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:55.798
"How to satisfy you only I know."

01:43:56.064 --> 01:43:57.543
"|n the morning we forget..."

01:43:57.598 --> 01:43:59.373
"...what we give and take night."

01:43:59.433 --> 01:44:00.639
"Give and take."

01:44:00.701 --> 01:44:02.237
"Give and take."

01:44:02.437 --> 01:44:04.144
Small balls"

01:44:04.205 --> 01:44:05.343
Oh no...

01:44:06.007 --> 01:44:06.644
Shall we begin.

01:44:06.707 --> 01:44:08.152
Oh no...

01:44:08.609 --> 01:44:10.452
"Ooh aah Ooh aah...
- Ouch!"

01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:14.055
"Come on my doubts."

01:44:14.115 --> 01:44:15.753
"Ooh aah Ooh aah..."

01:44:16.017 --> 01:44:17.621
"Ooh aah Ooh aah...
- Ouch!"

01:44:17.685 --> 01:44:19.323
Sorry, sorry, sorry...belt."

01:44:19.387 --> 01:44:23.267
"Ooh aah Ooh aah...
- Ouch!"

01:44:28.662 --> 01:44:30.471
"Party hard."

01:44:37.071 --> 01:44:38.709
"The season's hot."

01:44:38.773 --> 01:44:42.778
"|n this hot season,
cool your body."

01:44:44.145 --> 01:44:47.490
"Don't let it rust,
it's lying around."

01:44:47.548 --> 01:44:50.427
"Use the tool of your heart."

01:44:50.484 --> 01:44:52.794
"Drop the curtains."

01:44:53.053 --> 01:44:56.432
"Show them what they
haven't seen before."

01:44:56.490 --> 01:44:59.494
"Wake up what's sleeping."

01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:01.369
"|n the morning we forget..."

01:45:01.429 --> 01:45:02.737
"...what we give and take night."

01:45:02.997 --> 01:45:04.169
"Give and take."

01:45:04.198 --> 01:45:07.543
When your heart and soul become one...

01:45:08.035 --> 01:45:10.140
One more...this is
getting in my mouth.

01:45:12.306 --> 01:45:14.149
"Come on my doubts."

01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:17.586
"Ooh aah Ooh aah...
- Ouch!"

01:45:19.246 --> 01:45:21.453
Sorry, I forgot.

01:45:21.616 --> 01:45:22.720
The banana...

01:45:22.983 --> 01:45:23.518
Sorry..

01:45:23.584 --> 01:45:25.723
Save me. Save me. Hurry up.

01:45:25.986 --> 01:45:27.659
Save me. Save me.

01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:31.136
"And fulfil my desires."

01:45:31.458 --> 01:45:33.062
"Lawmarfs right here."

01:45:33.127 --> 01:45:34.606
"Where do you think you're going?"

01:45:34.662 --> 01:45:36.437
Don't ever listen to an elder woman.

01:45:36.497 --> 01:45:37.032
Quickly...

01:45:38.499 --> 01:45:39.534
"|n the morning we forget..."

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.170
"...what we give and take night."

01:45:41.235 --> 01:45:43.715
You lose...
- Cut.

01:45:43.771 --> 01:45:45.182
Diet poke.

01:45:51.145 --> 01:45:53.022
"Ooh aah Ooh aah...
- Ouch!"

01:45:54.415 --> 01:45:56.554
"Come on my doubts."
- What's that bloody wheelchair...

01:45:56.617 --> 01:45:58.187
Sorry...sorry..

01:45:58.385 --> 01:46:00.023
"Ooh aah Ooh aah...

01:46:01.555 --> 01:46:05.059
"Ooh aah Ooh aah...
- Ouch!"

01:46:05.126 --> 01:46:08.596
Don't worry...| won't
give you a reason to complain.

01:46:08.662 --> 01:46:10.505
"Come on my doubts."

01:46:12.266 --> 01:46:14.041
"Ooh aah Ooh aah...
- Ouch!"

01:46:15.703 --> 01:46:19.583
"Ooh aah Ooh aah...

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:20.448
Cut it!
