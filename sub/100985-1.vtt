WEBVTT

02:17.868 --> 02:19.870
Okay, how you feeling?

02:23.607 --> 02:24.839
What do you mean?

02:24.841 --> 02:26.810
I mean, you know, in
general how do you feel?

02:28.446 --> 02:29.677
Should I be anxious?

02:29.679 --> 02:31.780
No, no, no, no,
absolutely not.

02:31.782 --> 02:34.716
That's the last thing I
want you to be right now.

02:34.718 --> 02:39.723
You should feel, I don't
know, sunny, happy, excited.

02:45.997 --> 02:47.664
I'll aspire to
be those things.

02:50.033 --> 02:51.199
Good girl.

02:51.201 --> 02:51.968
Come here.

02:54.971 --> 02:59.507
All right, I got a good
feeling about this.

02:59.509 --> 03:02.043
These people at this party,
they got Henry Shepherd's

03:02.045 --> 03:03.844
last three plays produced.

03:03.846 --> 03:07.517
Three, and all I need
is the first one.

03:10.220 --> 03:13.054
Okay, all right, we got this.

03:13.056 --> 03:14.255
I got this.

03:14.257 --> 03:15.356
What
about the salad bowls?

03:15.358 --> 03:16.259
What about them?

03:17.427 --> 03:19.660
We don't have enough
room for the large ones.

03:19.662 --> 03:20.861
- I've got seven people.
- That's all right.

03:20.863 --> 03:22.466
We don't need them, not tonight.

03:24.167 --> 03:26.067
So we're just not
gonna have salad.

03:26.069 --> 03:27.168
We always have salad.

03:27.170 --> 03:28.602
Can we do that?

03:28.604 --> 03:30.974
Look around you, Sebastian,
we do whatever we want.

03:32.409 --> 03:34.909
Are we really gonna have
the same fucking soppressata

03:34.911 --> 03:36.343
on the charcuterie?

03:36.345 --> 03:38.414
What kinda person
quibbles over charcuterie?

03:53.828 --> 03:56.897
Do you think they'll
bring a Monfortino Barolo?

03:56.899 --> 04:00.367
No, they'll bring a
nice, full-bodied red

04:00.369 --> 04:03.372
they picked up for $12.

04:06.408 --> 04:09.545
It's common courtesy.

04:13.282 --> 04:14.747
Do you have your pills?

04:14.749 --> 04:16.716
I think they're in your
jacket pocket, right?

04:16.718 --> 04:17.649
Right.

04:17.652 --> 04:19.052
Do you have my cell phone?

04:19.053 --> 04:20.353
Fuck it.

04:23.325 --> 04:24.725
Okay, happy face.

04:26.261 --> 04:27.195
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:29.763 --> 04:30.795
Who the fuck are you?

04:30.797 --> 04:32.465
I'm Jeffrey Duncan.

04:32.467 --> 04:34.169
This is my wife, Haley.

04:36.670 --> 04:37.838
What are you selling?

04:39.740 --> 04:40.907
Hm?

04:40.909 --> 04:42.375
We're not selling anything.

04:42.377 --> 04:44.078
We were invited
to dinner tonight.

04:45.046 --> 04:45.879
At this house?

04:47.081 --> 04:48.414
- Yeah, right, Jeff?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:48.416 --> 04:49.951
No, no, yeah, absolutely, yeah.

04:51.252 --> 04:53.519
I don't give a rat's
diminutive ass, but I recommend

04:53.521 --> 04:56.355
that you peasants remove
yourselves from this doorstep

04:56.357 --> 04:58.660
before I call the
police or worse.

04:59.594 --> 05:01.961
Now both of you can fuck off.

05:07.768 --> 05:09.971
What the fuck was that?

05:12.940 --> 05:14.206
Maybe we should just go.

05:14.208 --> 05:16.575
No, no, we're not leaving.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.145
We are not leaving.

05:41.734 --> 05:43.570
Oh yeah, okay, yeah.

05:44.837 --> 05:46.404
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you got us.

05:46.406 --> 05:47.239
You got us, right?

05:47.241 --> 05:49.307
Didn't he, Hales, right?

05:49.309 --> 05:50.942
Totally, yeah.

05:50.944 --> 05:54.412
Your faces, you would've thought
I was trying to kill you.

05:54.414 --> 05:55.647
Well, don't just
stand there like some

05:55.649 --> 05:58.816
Victorian era orphans
begging for a hand out.

05:58.818 --> 05:59.652
Come in.

06:02.655 --> 06:05.589
Okay, let's go in.

06:05.591 --> 06:06.926
Yeah, come in.

06:08.361 --> 06:10.296
- It's all right.
- Come on.

06:16.902 --> 06:18.168
It's so big.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.472
This house is fantastic.

06:23.009 --> 06:24.841
And this is just the foyer.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.412
Well, you'll see.

06:28.948 --> 06:30.481
Forgive my tomfoolery.

06:30.483 --> 06:33.083
I have a bit of a wicked streak.

06:33.085 --> 06:34.551
Oh, no, it was hilarious.

06:34.553 --> 06:36.553
We loved it, right?

06:36.555 --> 06:37.955
Sure.

06:37.957 --> 06:39.723
Sebastian Todd.

06:39.725 --> 06:40.559
Haley.

06:44.764 --> 06:47.498
Pleasure to meet you, Mr.
Playwright Extraordinaire.

06:47.500 --> 06:48.333
Just Jeff.

06:50.168 --> 06:52.637
Kiss it, it's customary.

06:55.806 --> 06:56.641
Okay.

06:58.910 --> 07:01.177
So where's Carmine?

07:01.179 --> 07:04.547
Busy concocting one of his
savory delights as always.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.182
We brought wine.

07:06.184 --> 07:07.450
- Oh.
- I hope you like it.

07:07.452 --> 07:08.484
I tried my best.

07:08.486 --> 07:11.487
How rustic.

07:11.489 --> 07:12.924
Haley picked it out.

07:15.093 --> 07:15.960
We'll adore it.

07:17.362 --> 07:20.096
Now as you both know, this
is a phone-free event.

07:20.098 --> 07:21.964
Deposit your cellular
devices in my...

07:21.966 --> 07:23.232
Wait, what?

07:23.234 --> 07:25.770
Everyone loathes an
amateur paparazzi pic.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.172
I understand.

07:29.174 --> 07:30.508
That's right, good boy.

07:31.943 --> 07:35.777
Make yourselves at home
in the room to your right.

07:35.779 --> 07:38.415
Knock a few balls around
if the spirit moves you.

07:40.517 --> 07:42.184
Ta ta, children.

07:50.260 --> 07:51.095
What?

07:58.235 --> 08:00.001
Haley, Haley, what was that?

08:00.003 --> 08:01.169
What was what?

08:01.171 --> 08:02.704
I'm trying to
impress these people.

08:02.706 --> 08:05.907
Okay, but that thing at
the door was psychoville.

08:05.909 --> 08:07.309
That didn't seem off to you?

08:07.311 --> 08:08.510
Yeah, and you would know

08:08.512 --> 08:09.778
what constitutes
psychoville, right?

08:09.780 --> 08:11.382
What is that supposed to mean?

08:12.316 --> 08:13.150
Nothing.

08:24.627 --> 08:28.095
Look, the people at this party

08:28.097 --> 08:30.398
are the proverbial
cream of the crop.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.366
We're talking buckets of money.

08:32.368 --> 08:35.469
Think connections and influence
everywhere, all right?

08:35.471 --> 08:37.004
And they are not the type
of people that want you

08:37.006 --> 08:39.774
texting during dinner
or uploading pictures

08:39.775 --> 08:41.542
of your food to social media.

08:41.544 --> 08:45.181
They have reputations,
legacies even to protect.

08:49.385 --> 08:52.520
I love you, I do, and I
am sorry you're upset.

08:52.522 --> 08:55.022
And I guess I am just a
little bit nervous here.

08:55.024 --> 09:00.096
But, Haley, if we
impress these people,

09:01.464 --> 09:04.634
my play is headed straight
for Broadway, right?

09:07.069 --> 09:09.071
Yeah, no, you're
right, totally right.

09:12.374 --> 09:13.208
I'm sorry.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.308
It's okay.

09:15.310 --> 09:16.209
I hope it's that
simple for you.

09:16.211 --> 09:17.045
I'm sorry.

09:19.481 --> 09:20.482
Good girl.

09:23.819 --> 09:26.052
You don't
look comfortable.

09:26.054 --> 09:30.792
No, no, we're completely
comfortable, right Hales?

09:31.760 --> 09:33.061
I wasn't talking to you.

09:36.431 --> 09:37.332
I'm Sadie.

09:38.733 --> 09:41.603
Would either of you like a
glass of wine or an aperitif?

09:44.206 --> 09:45.574
Absolutely, yeah.

09:48.176 --> 09:49.010
Can't wait.

09:51.880 --> 09:52.681
Fuck me.

09:53.982 --> 09:56.115
They like you, huh?

10:31.619 --> 10:34.486
Do you need one?

10:34.488 --> 10:36.021
No, I'm fine.

10:36.023 --> 10:40.427
I didn't ask how you were,
I asked if you needed one.

10:42.396 --> 10:43.197
Yeah.

10:49.135 --> 10:52.470
I think I'm getting
worse or something.

10:52.472 --> 10:54.071
I had another
nightmare last night.

10:54.073 --> 10:56.140
You used to have
three a night.

10:56.142 --> 10:57.945
You're getting better.

11:02.515 --> 11:06.020
I have a weird feeling
about this place.

11:08.087 --> 11:09.822
I can't stop shaking.

11:10.991 --> 11:12.256
Maybe we should just go, Jeff.

11:12.258 --> 11:13.326
Stop, stop.

11:15.963 --> 11:17.430
Just relax, okay?

11:18.298 --> 11:19.465
It's just dinner.

11:22.135 --> 11:23.834
Okay, okay, it's a chance.

11:23.836 --> 11:26.905
I mean, it's the chance, Haley.

11:26.907 --> 11:30.008
But after tonight
everything is just downhill.

11:30.010 --> 11:31.477
And I need this to happen.

11:34.881 --> 11:36.315
I really need this to happen.

11:39.518 --> 11:40.352
I'm sorry.

11:41.955 --> 11:43.288
There's no I in team.

11:48.093 --> 11:51.630
Vino to ease you
into the evening.

11:52.899 --> 11:55.765
- Thank you.
- We'll get started shortly.

11:55.767 --> 11:56.568
Thank you.

11:58.503 --> 11:59.705
May I have one?

12:06.678 --> 12:08.413
You're on medication.

12:19.658 --> 12:21.259
So did you kiss your king yet?

12:22.828 --> 12:23.661
Yeah.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.700
- I like the king.
- Yeah?

12:31.702 --> 12:36.240
Yeah, it reminds me that you
are just as neurotic as me.

12:40.645 --> 12:42.378
When I was in the hospital,
there was this boy who had

12:42.380 --> 12:44.880
this lucky pair of socks.

12:44.882 --> 12:48.419
The nurses had a hell of a
time getting them off of him.

12:50.221 --> 12:53.322
They smelled so bad,
like rotten onions.

12:53.324 --> 12:54.392
That's gross, Haley.

12:58.796 --> 13:03.768
Haley, no hospital and no
crazy talk tonight, understand?

13:06.938 --> 13:09.340
Yeah, all right, I promise.

13:11.775 --> 13:13.207
Promise him.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.575
- Jeff.
- Come on, honey.

13:14.577 --> 13:15.879
For me, please.

13:21.986 --> 13:22.987
I promise.

13:25.789 --> 13:26.790
Good girl.

13:28.191 --> 13:29.026
Come here.

13:38.201 --> 13:41.302
Jeff, sometimes
I feel like you

13:41.304 --> 13:42.973
- I don't know...
- Wow.

13:46.843 --> 13:49.279
Wow, now that is art.

13:55.086 --> 13:55.886
What is it?

13:57.387 --> 14:00.190
It's a $2 million painting
by a very celebrated artist.

14:03.258 --> 14:06.395
Well, that's what Carmine
paid for it anyway.

14:09.199 --> 14:13.368
He doesn't even
like it.

14:15.637 --> 14:16.570
I'm Vincent.

14:16.572 --> 14:17.406
Jeffrey Duncan.

14:22.145 --> 14:23.679
Oh, this is my wife, Haley.

14:24.914 --> 14:26.049
Nice to meet you.

14:27.850 --> 14:28.684
A pleasure.

14:31.653 --> 14:35.223
So Vincent, are
you an art dealer?

14:35.225 --> 14:38.391
Oh, nothing so interesting
and eclectic as that.

14:38.393 --> 14:40.694
I work for Quick and Adams.

14:40.696 --> 14:41.929
No kidding.

14:41.931 --> 14:43.064
Quick and who?

14:43.066 --> 14:44.831
It's an investment
firm, honey.

14:44.833 --> 14:47.635
I handle Carmine and
Sebastian's affairs.

14:49.071 --> 14:50.569
Oh.

14:50.571 --> 14:55.576
Speaking of Sebastian, he
did the door joke, didn't he?

14:57.179 --> 14:58.247
That he did, yes.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.081
Is he always that frightening?

15:01.083 --> 15:02.281
I mean, Haley, frightening...

15:02.283 --> 15:04.850
Its all right, Jeffrey.

15:04.852 --> 15:06.418
After all, what would
life be like without

15:06.420 --> 15:08.221
the acidic droll sense of humor

15:08.223 --> 15:11.226
percolating through the
brain of Sebastian Todd?

15:13.795 --> 15:17.498
Slightly better, in
my opinion.

15:26.574 --> 15:29.508
It is miraculous, isn't it?

15:29.510 --> 15:30.709
Absolutely, it's...

15:30.711 --> 15:32.981
The viewer sees
what he wants to see.

15:35.883 --> 15:40.821
I see mayhem, absolute
unbridled chaos.

15:50.597 --> 15:52.432
What do you see in it?

15:54.936 --> 15:55.769
Me?

16:00.007 --> 16:02.109
A Rorschach test, I guess.

16:03.877 --> 16:07.581
Exactly, so much is
left to interpretation.

16:08.748 --> 16:11.482
The meaning lies
with the observer.

16:11.484 --> 16:13.185
Jeff and Haley,

16:13.187 --> 16:16.057
may I present the inimitable
Miss Sadie Nichols.

16:17.791 --> 16:18.857
Yeah, we met her.

16:18.859 --> 16:20.792
She brought us wine.

16:20.794 --> 16:22.129
More than she did for me.

16:23.462 --> 16:25.863
You can have
this one, Vincent.

16:25.865 --> 16:28.632
Thank you, my darling.

16:28.634 --> 16:30.769
God, your dress is beautiful.

16:48.487 --> 16:50.924
It's one of my own creations.

16:53.026 --> 16:54.825
It's gorgeous.

16:54.827 --> 16:58.198
Sadie adorns
herself for a living.

16:59.798 --> 17:01.467
You mean
you're in fashion?

17:02.635 --> 17:04.869
I'm in whatever I want
to be at the moment.

17:05.804 --> 17:07.473
You know, whatever moves me.

17:09.407 --> 17:12.309
Well, we know that Jeff
here is a playwright.

17:12.310 --> 17:13.145
Guilty.

17:14.113 --> 17:15.512
And what do you do, Haley?

17:20.386 --> 17:22.219
Well, you know, same as you.

17:22.221 --> 17:25.723
A little of this and that,
nothing terribly interesting.

17:26.790 --> 17:31.796
I wouldn't say that.

17:33.165 --> 17:36.634
I could really use a
restroom, if that's okay.

17:37.903 --> 17:40.838
Of course, use
the upstairs bath.

17:41.974 --> 17:44.176
First door on the
left past the alcove.

17:47.478 --> 17:48.314
Thank you.

17:49.348 --> 17:52.481
Well, we should be dancing on.

17:52.483 --> 17:53.851
My turn to set the table.

17:54.987 --> 17:57.287
And what are you
doing tonight, love?

17:57.289 --> 17:58.424
Side dishes.

17:59.523 --> 18:00.522
Ah.

18:00.524 --> 18:01.792
We'll see you at dinner.

18:03.962 --> 18:05.027
Can't wait.

18:05.029 --> 18:05.862
See you.

18:08.967 --> 18:09.800
Cheers.

18:16.207 --> 18:17.874
Haley, are you okay?

18:19.043 --> 18:24.048
I'm fine, really.

19:02.585 --> 19:04.520
This house is so weird.

19:44.460 --> 19:47.094
Are you ready, Haley?

19:47.096 --> 19:48.164
Haley, Haley?

19:55.538 --> 19:58.541
We have to talk
about this sometime.

19:59.942 --> 20:02.042
What the fuck is
wrong with you, huh?

20:02.044 --> 20:03.210
What, what?

20:03.212 --> 20:05.345
Speak up, just talk.

20:05.347 --> 20:06.779
You can't talk anymore?

20:06.781 --> 20:08.614
You're like a toddler,
like a child, like a child.

20:08.616 --> 20:10.384
Bedtime, bedtime, what
are you talking about?

20:10.386 --> 20:11.919
The fuckin' sun's still up.

20:11.921 --> 20:13.454
What are you on?

20:13.456 --> 20:14.290
What are you on?

20:15.458 --> 20:17.558
I'm not gonna put up
with this much longer.

20:17.560 --> 20:18.894
What are you looking at?

20:39.746 --> 20:41.847
- Hi.
- Oh my God.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.216
I'm so sorry.

20:43.218 --> 20:44.450
For what?

20:44.452 --> 20:45.817
I didn't see
anything, I swear.

20:45.819 --> 20:47.819
Are you here for dinner?

20:47.821 --> 20:49.322
What?

20:49.324 --> 20:53.426
Are you here for dinner?

20:53.428 --> 20:54.429
Yes, I am.

20:56.231 --> 20:57.063
I should probably leave.

20:57.065 --> 20:57.865
Why?

20:58.866 --> 21:00.699
You're naked.

21:00.701 --> 21:03.071
We're grown women, aren't we?

21:04.805 --> 21:06.105
I don't know you.

21:06.107 --> 21:07.841
Well, that's easy to remedy.

21:09.511 --> 21:11.276
Agatha Archer.

21:11.278 --> 21:12.878
The writer?

21:12.880 --> 21:17.618
I prefer novelist,
it's more elegant.

21:19.453 --> 21:21.386
My husband is
gonna lose his mind.

21:21.388 --> 21:23.787
He's such a huge fan of yours.

21:23.789 --> 21:25.390
He's a playwright.

21:25.392 --> 21:26.994
Jeff, Jeffrey Duncan.

21:27.961 --> 21:29.396
Yeah, whatever.

21:30.863 --> 21:32.763
Then you are?

21:32.765 --> 21:34.800
Haley Duncan.

21:35.868 --> 21:37.404
Wonderful to meet you, Haley.

21:38.771 --> 21:42.276
Tell me, is your husband
as attractive as you?

21:44.810 --> 21:47.245
Well, I did marry him so.

21:50.551 --> 21:52.651
I should probably
let you get dressed.

21:52.653 --> 21:53.453
Don't go.

21:54.687 --> 21:57.122
We were just getting
to know each other.

21:57.124 --> 21:59.791
I think we know each other
just fine now, don't you?

22:00.893 --> 22:01.693
No.

22:03.095 --> 22:07.730
For that you'd have to slip out
of this funny little number.

22:07.732 --> 22:08.568
I'd rather not.

22:09.701 --> 22:12.169
Haley, love, Jeff
sent me for you.

22:12.171 --> 22:15.139
He thought maybe you
were lost up here.

22:15.141 --> 22:16.574
Is everything all right?

22:16.576 --> 22:17.608
Do you know your way down?

22:17.610 --> 22:18.810
Yes, thank you.

22:20.112 --> 22:21.645
It was nice to meet you.

22:21.647 --> 22:22.481
Likewise.

22:27.086 --> 22:29.422
You witchy bitch.

22:30.289 --> 22:33.524
Impeccable timing as always.

22:33.526 --> 22:36.395
We can't have you corrupting
her just yet, Aggie.

22:37.430 --> 22:38.598
You know that.

23:06.491 --> 23:09.158
Gracefully
done, Mr. Todd.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.826
He really enjoys
that, doesn't he?

23:10.828 --> 23:12.763
He loves to pour.

23:15.233 --> 23:18.201
You will put that out
before dinner, won't you?

23:18.203 --> 23:20.336
Let me enjoy my vice, please.

23:20.338 --> 23:22.672
We all have our
vices, Vincent,

23:22.674 --> 23:24.943
but yours kills by association.

23:27.445 --> 23:30.615
All right, Aggie,
I'll take a break.

23:31.549 --> 23:32.384
Thank you.

23:33.851 --> 23:38.788
Jeffrey, I want to thank
you for this nice Merlot.

23:40.257 --> 23:42.626
It's quite inspired.

23:45.262 --> 23:46.096
You're welcome.

23:48.499 --> 23:51.566
I have to say you have
one hell of a house here.

23:51.568 --> 23:52.403
Thank you.

23:53.537 --> 23:55.606
Do you ever worry
about break-ins?

23:56.740 --> 23:58.307
No, no, Mrs. Duncan.

23:58.309 --> 24:00.642
I suppose the curse of
owning an expensive home

24:00.644 --> 24:03.045
is owning an equally
expensive security system

24:03.047 --> 24:04.546
and of course always
being cautious.

24:04.548 --> 24:07.382
Which explains
the no phone policy.

24:07.384 --> 24:10.688
Technology is a barrier
to real human connection.

24:11.789 --> 24:15.023
Quite true,
Vincent, quite true.

24:15.025 --> 24:17.092
Of course that policy has
a little to do with safety

24:17.094 --> 24:20.128
and security and more to do
with just wanting you all to be

24:20.130 --> 24:23.731
here present with each other
without the distraction.

24:23.733 --> 24:25.702
Without distractions indeed.

24:26.868 --> 24:29.203
Without the noise that
drowns out coherent,

24:29.205 --> 24:30.606
truly present thought.

24:33.142 --> 24:37.311
And as for security, Carmine,
my incantations would've

24:37.313 --> 24:40.915
served you far better than
your overpriced alarm system.

24:40.917 --> 24:45.086
So would a rabbit's
foot I'm sure.

24:45.088 --> 24:46.823
What, what was that?

24:50.226 --> 24:51.060
Nothing, it was nothing.

24:52.662 --> 24:55.162
Sure looked
like something.

24:55.164 --> 24:56.632
Jeff has a good luck charm.

24:57.433 --> 25:01.068
Oh, well look at that.

25:01.070 --> 25:04.705
No, it's just
something I carry around.

25:04.707 --> 25:06.676
Our curiosity is
piqued, Jeffrey.

25:10.979 --> 25:12.180
Okay, okay, all right.

25:16.785 --> 25:18.084
A chess king?

25:18.086 --> 25:19.386
A chess king.

25:19.388 --> 25:22.689
He keeps it beside his
laptop when he writes.

25:22.691 --> 25:24.493
It was his grandfather's
lucky king.

25:25.727 --> 25:29.229
Well, that makes it
supremely powerful.

25:29.231 --> 25:32.465
Please, Vincent, good
luck charms are only as good

25:32.467 --> 25:35.468
as red herrings in the
first few chapters.

25:35.470 --> 25:38.073
Charms are history, Agatha.

25:40.809 --> 25:45.814
Exactly, I wouldn't
be surprised if a bit

25:46.681 --> 25:48.281
of Jeff's grandfather's soul

25:48.283 --> 25:53.288
still inhabits that
little sliver of plastic.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.593
It's fucking plastic.

26:01.595 --> 26:03.729
All right, all right.

26:03.731 --> 26:06.331
It can't be
good for the environment.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.500
All in good fun,
all in good fun.

26:08.502 --> 26:10.669
All in good fun.

26:10.671 --> 26:13.875
It's still a beautiful
thought, though, right babe?

26:15.309 --> 26:16.143
I suppose so.

26:17.845 --> 26:20.916
Charms, symbols, spells,

26:22.116 --> 26:24.485
they have power when the
belief is strong enough.

26:25.719 --> 26:29.256
Yes, the power of belief.

26:30.624 --> 26:33.826
After all, what would
Jesus be without his cross?

26:33.828 --> 26:37.296
What would the Buddha be
without his Bodhi tree?

26:37.298 --> 26:39.700
You'd know, wouldn't
you, you old fuck?

26:40.835 --> 26:43.335
How often do
you have these dinners?

26:43.337 --> 26:46.305
These secret dinners.

26:46.307 --> 26:47.138
All right.

26:47.140 --> 26:48.606
Carmine?

26:48.608 --> 26:51.275
You did take the
precautions we talked about

26:51.277 --> 26:52.610
on the telephone?

26:52.612 --> 26:56.280
Yes, yes, no one
knows we're here.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.985
In fact, they think
we're on vacation.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.989
I'm sorry, I guess I
just don't understand

27:04.991 --> 27:07.458
- the extremity.
- No, no, we understand.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.693
We understand.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.061
Especially after meeting
everyone here tonight.

27:10.063 --> 27:12.499
We completely understand
it, don't we Hales?

27:13.600 --> 27:14.902
Paparazzi are locusts.

27:16.569 --> 27:19.103
They'd be pitching tents
in Carmine's driveway

27:19.105 --> 27:22.540
if they knew that
Agatha were here.

27:22.542 --> 27:26.244
Miss Archer, I have
to admit I'm a huge fan.

27:26.246 --> 27:31.251
I mean, Clandestine Death, it
is a phenomenal novel, right?

27:32.118 --> 27:35.220
Oh, looks and brains I see.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.222
Likewise.

27:38.657 --> 27:42.894
We host twice a year,
high summer, high winter.

27:42.896 --> 27:44.728
Thank
you for having us.

27:44.730 --> 27:48.798
Well, I'm loathe to
break up this small talk,

27:48.800 --> 27:53.805
but I think this party is
desperate for a little music.

27:54.974 --> 27:55.909
- Ah.
- Ooh.

27:57.109 --> 27:59.411
Yes, tradition, Sadie dear.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.714
Wait, what is going on?

28:04.716 --> 28:06.918
A little parlor game.

28:06.920 --> 28:09.721
The winner chooses the music.

28:10.924 --> 28:12.357
In other words, me.

28:39.383 --> 28:42.653
What, a
little five-card stud?

28:44.155 --> 28:47.256
No, another day perhaps.

28:47.258 --> 28:48.092
This is tarot.

28:49.226 --> 28:50.192
What's that?

28:50.194 --> 28:51.162
It's a fortune-teller.

28:52.163 --> 28:53.197
A crude definition.

28:54.398 --> 28:56.100
The proper term is divination.

28:57.501 --> 29:02.404
Asking an individual to choose
specific cards and reading

29:02.406 --> 29:06.577
signs and omens to determine
their path in life.

29:08.379 --> 29:13.114
The querent chooses their
path based on the reading,

29:13.116 --> 29:15.183
not the other way around.

29:15.185 --> 29:16.117
A querent?

29:16.119 --> 29:17.685
The one who seeks.

29:17.687 --> 29:19.621
It's the person getting
their fortune read.

29:19.623 --> 29:21.424
I think she
understands, Jeffrey.

29:22.994 --> 29:26.129
Hurry up and shuffle the
cards before I get bored.

29:27.564 --> 29:29.100
Sadie here chooses a card,

29:31.501 --> 29:33.403
then we each select
one from the deck.

29:34.804 --> 29:37.805
The owner of the winning
card as determined by Sadie

29:37.807 --> 29:39.442
gets to pick the dinner music.

29:41.511 --> 29:42.345
Carmine.

29:48.418 --> 29:49.252
Sebastian.

30:14.476 --> 30:15.477
Guest first.

30:17.914 --> 30:20.614
Does it matter which one?

30:20.616 --> 30:22.917
Of course it does.

30:22.919 --> 30:24.586
Of course it does.

31:12.700 --> 31:13.801
Volunteers?

31:14.870 --> 31:16.569
No.

31:16.571 --> 31:17.503
What?

31:17.505 --> 31:18.771
You went first last time.

31:18.773 --> 31:20.606
- Sebastian.
- What, he did.

31:20.608 --> 31:21.942
No, I did not.

31:21.944 --> 31:23.509
It was the party with
the real estate couple.

31:23.511 --> 31:25.811
You wore your leather
bowtie with the eyes.

31:25.813 --> 31:26.880
Aggie drank too much.

31:26.882 --> 31:28.115
Carmine made tiramisu.

31:28.117 --> 31:30.185
You went first last
time, I remember!

31:34.287 --> 31:36.891
Fine, go first.

31:38.159 --> 31:39.894
Thank you, I will.

31:44.198 --> 31:49.170
The Fool, the spontaneity
of a carefree existence.

31:49.836 --> 31:50.936
In other words...

31:50.938 --> 31:51.772
An idiot.

31:53.875 --> 31:55.408
Let's see yours, smirky.

32:03.784 --> 32:07.086
The Magician, power
and skill brought forth

32:07.088 --> 32:10.390
by priceless and
ancient knowledge.

32:11.558 --> 32:15.562
Lucky, lucky, little cookie.

32:17.899 --> 32:18.732
Carmine.

32:22.668 --> 32:26.370
The Emperor, the
commanding rock

32:26.372 --> 32:29.107
upon which all things rely.

32:29.109 --> 32:30.407
Jeffrey.

32:30.409 --> 32:31.675
Yeah.

32:31.677 --> 32:32.879
Whenever you're ready.

32:38.285 --> 32:39.884
Uh oh.

32:39.886 --> 32:41.485
The Hanged Man.

32:41.487 --> 32:43.089
Yeah, uh oh is right.

32:44.991 --> 32:46.960
Shit, doesn't sound good.

32:48.228 --> 32:52.832
It's a symbol of
sacrifice, blessed martyrdom.

32:55.434 --> 32:57.403
Dear Aggie, which
card did you choose?

33:07.013 --> 33:09.680
Ooh.

33:10.815 --> 33:12.049
- The Lovers.
- Ooh, I know.

33:12.051 --> 33:13.683
What does it mean?

33:13.685 --> 33:16.354
A union of two
souls, an alignment.

33:17.755 --> 33:21.927
Carmine, it would mean that
if it were right side up.

33:23.896 --> 33:24.729
But it's not.

33:25.630 --> 33:27.430
So what does that mean?

33:27.432 --> 33:31.369
It means the love
is impure, twisted.

33:33.438 --> 33:34.672
Well, that bodes well.

33:37.977 --> 33:40.010
Sadie, what about yours?

33:40.012 --> 33:45.017
Dealer usually goes last,
but since you asked so nicely.

33:53.025 --> 33:54.559
Every fuckin' time.

33:55.861 --> 33:57.160
What is it?

33:57.162 --> 34:00.062
The High Priestess is
the keeper of shekinah.

34:00.064 --> 34:02.899
The female presence
of the divine mind.

34:02.901 --> 34:04.869
So superior.

34:06.137 --> 34:09.170
Well, only one left.

34:09.172 --> 34:10.540
Still game, Haley?

34:14.212 --> 34:15.045
Yeah.

34:21.085 --> 34:24.155
Oh shit, I thought
my card was bad.

34:25.389 --> 34:26.790
Don't fret, Haley love.

34:28.592 --> 34:30.359
Yes, the given is grim,

34:30.360 --> 34:33.463
but the Death card also
represents new beginnings.

34:34.598 --> 34:36.766
Rebirth as it were.

34:39.469 --> 34:40.804
What a relief.

34:42.040 --> 34:46.540
So who won?

34:46.542 --> 34:48.844
Ah, who won?

34:50.746 --> 34:54.449
Yes, my dear, which
card did you choose?

34:57.321 --> 34:58.188
The Fool.

35:01.590 --> 35:02.426
Yes, ha!

35:06.662 --> 35:11.232
Yes, yes, go make your
selection, Sebastian.

35:11.234 --> 35:14.102
Pardon me.

35:14.104 --> 35:16.938
So fuckin' happy.

35:16.940 --> 35:19.109
That was interesting.

35:41.430 --> 35:42.264
Shocking.

35:43.798 --> 35:45.498
I like it, it's classy.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.368
Sebastian's favorite.

35:47.370 --> 35:48.501
What is it?

35:48.503 --> 35:49.338
Puccini.

35:50.672 --> 35:52.406
One of his best operas

35:52.408 --> 35:55.909
and one of the best
operas ever written.

35:55.911 --> 35:57.677
And my second favorite.

35:57.679 --> 36:00.680
Tosca is
substandard, Sebastian.

36:00.682 --> 36:02.383
Rigoletto is genius.

36:02.385 --> 36:05.386
Puccini was a pop star.

36:05.388 --> 36:07.923
Verdi was an artist.

36:08.991 --> 36:10.126
I'm sorry, Rigoletto?

36:12.028 --> 36:13.760
You know him, don't you hon?

36:13.762 --> 36:14.827
I don't think so.

36:14.829 --> 36:16.796
Come on, Haley.

36:16.798 --> 36:20.302
Jesters, assassins,
La Donna E Mobile.

36:23.837 --> 36:26.508
Nobody asked for a
fucking serenade from you.

36:32.280 --> 36:35.884
Rigoletto is about the
fickleness of women.

36:37.152 --> 36:41.387
And if you don't or
can't accept that,

36:41.389 --> 36:44.390
you must resign yourself
to a life of misery.

36:44.392 --> 36:46.426
Speak for yourself.

36:46.428 --> 36:47.262
I will.

36:49.596 --> 36:50.697
That's so sad.

36:52.766 --> 36:56.804
Not as sad as Carmine's
favorite, Bluebeard's Castle.

36:59.007 --> 37:01.842
Sebastian, Chianti.

37:03.411 --> 37:04.245
Right.

37:05.579 --> 37:09.317
You guys are in for a surprise.

37:11.985 --> 37:15.822
This wine is like a
cousin of the Barolo.

37:17.191 --> 37:18.926
Very special wine.

37:19.860 --> 37:21.694
Not everyone gets to try it.

37:23.729 --> 37:24.662
Thank you.

37:24.664 --> 37:26.565
So enjoy it while you can.

37:26.567 --> 37:27.401
We will.

37:28.835 --> 37:33.373
Bluebeard's Castle, oh,
he's got the wives, right?

37:34.740 --> 37:37.375
Yeah, that's the one
where Bluebeard comes home

37:37.377 --> 37:40.414
with his new wife by
the name of Judith.

37:42.015 --> 37:45.350
Young, beautiful,
very perceptive.

37:45.352 --> 37:46.752
She knows something's wrong.

37:48.155 --> 37:51.655
You see, because Bluebeard
has three other wives.

37:51.657 --> 37:54.226
And not only that,
they have their own

37:54.228 --> 37:59.232
elaborate treasure rooms with
their own joys and delights.

38:01.601 --> 38:04.203
What she doesn't know is
that they live together

38:05.071 --> 38:06.738
in a torture chamber of sorts.

38:08.141 --> 38:10.875
And he collects
their tears in a lake

38:10.877 --> 38:13.110
because he thinks it's pretty.

38:13.112 --> 38:18.117
So then here's Bluebeard
arriving home triumphantly

38:19.585 --> 38:22.054
with his brand new
beautiful bride.

38:23.655 --> 38:28.359
That castle is dark,
so Judith politely asks

38:28.361 --> 38:30.596
to open the doors
to allow the sun in.

38:32.697 --> 38:35.834
Bluebeard refuses,
but she insists.

38:37.036 --> 38:38.335
So she sets about
opening the first

38:38.337 --> 38:40.670
of the seven doors,
which shows...

38:40.672 --> 38:43.442
A blood-stained
torture chamber.

38:45.743 --> 38:46.578
That's right.

38:47.711 --> 38:52.384
The second is a room
full of deadly weapons.

38:54.352 --> 38:59.357
The third is an elaborately
decorated treasure chamber.

39:00.592 --> 39:04.062
The fourth, garden of beauty.

39:05.063 --> 39:06.296
The fifth...

39:06.298 --> 39:07.399
Bluebeard's kingdom.

39:08.900 --> 39:13.905
Once vast and white, now
gloomy and stained with blood.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.041
And what was the sixth?

39:18.043 --> 39:19.710
The sea of sorrow.

39:21.479 --> 39:23.915
It was a bloody lake of tears.

39:24.815 --> 39:26.549
Same thing.

39:26.551 --> 39:28.119
No, it's not.

39:29.287 --> 39:33.258
So Judith opens that
last and final door,

39:34.391 --> 39:35.792
and what do you think
she finds, Haley?

39:40.364 --> 39:42.598
Bluebeard's three wives.

39:42.600 --> 39:46.635
They walk out with their
necks bent forward,

39:46.637 --> 39:49.673
weighted down by
heavily jeweled crowns.

39:50.975 --> 39:53.175
Before she could do
anything about it,

39:53.177 --> 39:58.182
he places a crown on her head
so that she can't escape.

40:00.251 --> 40:05.256
And she realizes that those
tears are from the other wives

40:06.690 --> 40:08.225
and that she'll be a part of
that for the rest of her life.

40:09.660 --> 40:12.363
And yadda, yadda, yadda,
they all have sex together.

40:16.367 --> 40:17.966
That's what all
operas are about.

40:17.968 --> 40:20.102
No, they're not.

40:20.104 --> 40:21.103
They're about love.

40:21.105 --> 40:22.405
Oh, same thing.

40:23.339 --> 40:24.607
No, it's not.

40:26.142 --> 40:27.675
Ask Berg.

40:27.677 --> 40:28.511
Berg?

40:31.581 --> 40:33.014
Berg is the author
of my favorite opera.

40:33.016 --> 40:33.850
Oh my God.

40:34.951 --> 40:36.619
Shut your fucking face.

40:37.553 --> 40:38.421
Here we go.

40:39.522 --> 40:41.088
Wozzeck.

40:41.090 --> 40:45.628
It's the tale of a brilliant
but poor and troubled soldier

40:47.096 --> 40:49.063
who is constantly being
lectured to by his betters

40:49.065 --> 40:52.900
about the qualities
of a decent man,

40:52.902 --> 40:54.671
which of course
they think he isn't.

40:56.139 --> 41:00.608
And they taunt him incessantly
because of his lusts

41:00.610 --> 41:02.412
for women and drink.

41:04.247 --> 41:08.349
The opera begins with a
conversation between Wozzeck

41:08.351 --> 41:09.849
and his captain,

41:09.851 --> 41:14.389
whom he skillfully shaves
with the sharpest of razors.

41:15.791 --> 41:18.558
And his captain is giving
him hell as per usual,

41:18.560 --> 41:20.327
but Wozzeck says...

41:20.329 --> 41:23.298
It's nearly impossible
for a poor man to be moral.

41:25.367 --> 41:26.533
And he quotes the
Gospel of Mark's

41:26.535 --> 41:28.601
admonition on the lips of Jesus,

41:28.603 --> 41:30.906
to suffer the little
children to come unto me,

41:32.140 --> 41:35.508
which only confuses
the captain thoroughly.

41:35.510 --> 41:37.711
How many little
children have you suffered

41:37.713 --> 41:39.014
to come on you, Father V.?

41:41.550 --> 41:42.982
You're a disgusting cunt.

41:47.089 --> 41:50.125
Wozzeck is sworn to
his role as a soldier,

41:51.593 --> 41:53.893
to a life of following
orders, to a ritual,

41:53.895 --> 41:58.597
and to a woman, Marie, a
great love whom he believes

41:58.599 --> 42:01.235
he cannot in practical
fact have or deserve.

42:04.238 --> 42:05.504
Hey.

42:05.506 --> 42:09.143
He believes the wrong
people, the wrong truth.

42:12.113 --> 42:15.416
He convinces himself that he
is not worthy of this woman.

42:16.684 --> 42:20.488
His mind turns in upon itself.

42:22.356 --> 42:25.991
And having convinced himself
assuredly that she has

42:25.993 --> 42:30.998
betrayed him, he murders his
beloved beneath the blood moon.

42:32.633 --> 42:37.436
And then he drowns himself
in a lake with the words...

42:37.438 --> 42:40.205
I thought you
were here for me.

42:40.207 --> 42:42.040
The moon is blood.

42:42.042 --> 42:42.878
Help.

42:44.345 --> 42:47.578
Something
wrong, Haley?

42:47.580 --> 42:49.180
It's fine.

42:49.182 --> 42:50.083
We're fine.

42:50.984 --> 42:53.219
Are we missing something?

42:55.121 --> 42:57.054
I had some things happen
to me when I was young.

42:57.056 --> 43:00.525
And this whole conversation
just, I'm sorry.

43:00.527 --> 43:02.662
I don't mean to be downer.

43:06.099 --> 43:08.533
Go right on ahead.

43:08.535 --> 43:11.070
It's a family
affair and just not

43:12.605 --> 43:15.275
proper dinner
conversation, right hon?

43:17.410 --> 43:19.143
I'm sure that we'd
all like to hear

43:19.145 --> 43:20.344
from Haley herself, Jeffrey.

43:20.346 --> 43:22.582
Discussing it makes
her uncomfortable.

43:34.928 --> 43:37.663
My mother killed
my stepfather.

43:44.803 --> 43:46.338
He used to...

43:48.440 --> 43:49.374
He raped you.

43:51.276 --> 43:54.279
Okay, this is just a
little too personal now.

43:56.348 --> 43:57.983
My mother was
manic-depressive.

44:01.520 --> 44:04.289
I don't know if she knew it
was happening to her or not.

44:06.225 --> 44:08.494
One day she just broke.

44:15.300 --> 44:20.305
One Saturday my stepfather
was yelling at her again,

44:24.809 --> 44:26.577
calling her names, berating her.

44:28.112 --> 44:29.080
Drunk as usual.

44:36.587 --> 44:39.323
I've never seen
her look so calm.

44:43.127 --> 44:44.495
She looked right at me,

44:50.301 --> 44:53.335
and then she just started
screaming like some wild thing

44:53.337 --> 44:57.608
and then just started
hacking him to pieces.

45:02.246 --> 45:05.314
And I was screaming
and I was screaming.

45:05.316 --> 45:08.450
And I asked her to stop,
and it didn't stop.

45:08.452 --> 45:09.386
She didn't stop.

45:15.026 --> 45:17.694
And then she cut her own throat.

45:24.601 --> 45:27.602
And I spent the next
two years in hospitals

45:27.604 --> 45:29.804
staring at ink blots.

45:29.806 --> 45:31.207
Rorschach tests.

45:36.212 --> 45:39.147
My mother was chief of surgery

45:39.149 --> 45:40.381
and my father was a sheriff.

45:40.383 --> 45:41.919
I was a spoiled brat.

45:45.155 --> 45:46.823
I wanted everything.

45:48.025 --> 45:49.860
I would pitch a fit
if I didn't get it.

45:51.661 --> 45:54.698
One day, my parents sat me
down and served me liver.

45:56.633 --> 45:57.899
That doesn't sound so bad.

45:57.901 --> 45:58.969
Human liver.

46:01.537 --> 46:06.542
You see, the body was on
my mama's operating table.

46:10.479 --> 46:14.383
Brought the liver home,
my daddy prepared it,

46:16.151 --> 46:21.156
and they sat me down and
made me eat every bite

46:23.927 --> 46:26.560
while they lectured
me on gluttony.

46:26.562 --> 46:27.463
I'm so sorry.

46:30.100 --> 46:33.367
And my father said to me, boy,

46:33.369 --> 46:36.906
you only one step away
from being an animal.

46:44.713 --> 46:46.048
Everybody got scars.

46:50.351 --> 46:52.151
Some are just more
well-hidden than others.

46:52.153 --> 46:53.321
Haley, stop.

46:55.790 --> 46:57.258
Can you excuse us for a bit?

46:58.292 --> 46:59.094
Of course.

47:08.569 --> 47:09.671
What did I tell you?

47:10.672 --> 47:11.506
What did I say?

47:12.640 --> 47:14.542
Enough about your
fucked up past, Haley.

47:15.810 --> 47:16.644
Get off.

47:18.881 --> 47:22.550
Not another goddamn
word, do you understand?

47:25.154 --> 47:26.320
- Look at me.
- Yes.

47:29.223 --> 47:30.224
Good girl.

47:33.827 --> 47:35.094
Pull yourself together.

47:35.096 --> 47:39.766
And Haley, pull yourself
together, fix your hair.

47:41.969 --> 47:43.468
Don't take so long.

47:43.470 --> 47:45.639
And put on a fuckin'
smile, it's a party.

47:52.312 --> 47:53.511
Everything okay?

47:53.513 --> 47:56.216
Everything's
great, absolutely.

47:58.719 --> 48:00.585
I want to apologize for my wife.

48:00.587 --> 48:02.787
You know, she just doesn't
understand that some things

48:02.789 --> 48:04.890
are best left unsaid, you know?

48:07.895 --> 48:09.995
I think it was good
for her actually.

48:09.997 --> 48:11.496
You do.

48:11.498 --> 48:15.635
Sure, talking about one's
pain can cleanse the soul.

48:17.604 --> 48:21.271
Maybe better done in
private, though, you know?

48:21.273 --> 48:23.509
Not with a group of
people you just met.

48:30.349 --> 48:31.985
What are you staring at?

48:34.020 --> 48:36.689
You're a little more French
than I'm accustomed to.

48:43.429 --> 48:45.130
Excuse me, I'm gonna...

48:45.132 --> 48:48.799
What you meant was you're
not accustomed to it on women.

48:48.801 --> 48:51.335
Because what's standard,
what's normative

48:51.337 --> 48:55.142
is always different
for us, for Haley.

48:57.543 --> 49:00.211
But anyways, your approval
of my physical presentation

49:00.213 --> 49:02.082
is neither desired nor required.

49:10.956 --> 49:12.423
Are you sure you're okay?

49:13.993 --> 49:16.162
I don't know, it just
sort of came on me.

49:18.329 --> 49:20.933
Well, maybe you should
get some more wine.

49:40.019 --> 49:41.285
I'm sorry.

49:41.287 --> 49:43.122
Haley, darling,
are you all right?

49:45.191 --> 49:47.193
Yeah, yeah.

49:50.762 --> 49:51.763
Apologies.

49:52.932 --> 49:56.734
Jeffrey, is everything
copacetic over there?

50:00.038 --> 50:02.704
Just I couldn't stop coughing.

50:02.706 --> 50:03.607
And now I can't...

50:05.642 --> 50:06.777
I just can't cool down.

50:13.517 --> 50:15.852
This music is gorgeous.

50:15.854 --> 50:18.520
It's Tosca, a
veritable diamond mine

50:18.522 --> 50:22.457
of melody and emotion and sex.

50:22.459 --> 50:25.562
The plot of Madame Butterfly
is far more interesting.

50:26.763 --> 50:31.735
Oh, who gives a fuck
about the plot, Aggie?

50:33.104 --> 50:35.340
It's about how the thing
makes you feel in your crotch.

50:36.773 --> 50:41.645
Hit all the right notes, you
go home, you get laid.

50:43.747 --> 50:47.481
I want to hear the
plot, if you don't mind.

50:47.483 --> 50:48.649
Tosca is a...

50:48.651 --> 50:52.419
A singer named
Floria Tosca is in love

50:52.421 --> 50:53.955
with a painter named Mario.

50:53.957 --> 50:56.557
Now Mario has a
friend, Angelotti,

50:56.559 --> 50:58.527
who's being hunted
by the local police.

51:00.030 --> 51:04.334
Mario decides to hide Angelotti
in the basement of a church.

51:05.768 --> 51:10.240
But the police chief, Scarpia,
arrests and tortures Mario,

51:11.341 --> 51:13.041
forcing him to
reveal the location

51:13.043 --> 51:14.644
of Angelotti's hiding place.

51:15.711 --> 51:19.047
Scarpia makes a deal with Tosca.

51:19.049 --> 51:24.054
He says, give yourself to
me mind, body, and soul,

51:26.256 --> 51:29.391
and I'll let your lover
and his friend go free.

51:29.393 --> 51:30.859
What does she do?

51:30.861 --> 51:34.196
She agrees, sacrifices
herself for the one she loves.

51:35.630 --> 51:39.969
But in opera as in life,
nothing is ever as it seems.

51:42.238 --> 51:43.072
It's time.

51:46.708 --> 51:50.880
Scarpia releases Mario who
is angered at Tosca's betrayal.

51:52.915 --> 51:56.252
Scarpia's men drag
the painter away,

51:57.286 --> 51:58.787
leaving him alone with Tosca.

52:02.224 --> 52:06.726
He sings to her, proclaiming
his sinful lusts,

52:06.728 --> 52:10.931
his desire for knowledge,
right then and there.

52:10.933 --> 52:12.534
When Tosca realizes

52:18.140 --> 52:20.575
that she has betrayed
herself before God,

52:31.019 --> 52:33.754
she raises her voice
in prostration.

52:44.399 --> 52:46.633
Why is happening?

52:48.336 --> 52:50.438
She grabs the knife
from the dinner table

52:52.140 --> 52:57.112
and holds it high
and so weaves her

52:58.480 --> 52:59.147
her immortal words.

53:08.289 --> 53:10.057
This is Tosca's kiss.

53:12.393 --> 53:13.657
No!

53:18.265 --> 53:20.564
You're fucking crazy!

53:20.566 --> 53:21.402
No!

53:22.936 --> 53:25.005
Lucky girl.

53:27.041 --> 53:28.275
He is a grower.

53:31.544 --> 53:32.645
No, no, no!

53:57.270 --> 53:59.671
I would say he's
sufficiently weakened.

54:00.940 --> 54:04.110
Sebastian, if you will,
my cleaver and my apron.

54:41.447 --> 54:43.314
Calm yourself.

54:43.316 --> 54:44.484
Calm yourself.

54:45.951 --> 54:48.019
Calm yourself, all right?

54:49.421 --> 54:52.355
Killing you is not
nearly as elegant

54:52.357 --> 54:56.092
as what we have planned, okay?

54:56.094 --> 54:57.062
We need you.

54:58.796 --> 54:59.797
We all do.

55:01.266 --> 55:02.567
You are necessary.

55:05.403 --> 55:10.240
See, we, each of us, have very
specific wants and desires

55:10.242 --> 55:13.211
that we'd like to share
with you if that's okay.

55:14.778 --> 55:16.212
- No, no.
- We can't just

55:16.214 --> 55:18.150
reveal them to everybody.

55:19.518 --> 55:21.017
Just you.

55:21.019 --> 55:24.589
And once we've completed our
tasks, satiated ourselves,

55:26.591 --> 55:27.926
we'll send you on your way.

55:28.860 --> 55:30.026
One way or another.

55:30.028 --> 55:31.563
I trust you've
prepared your room.

55:35.798 --> 55:37.535
Boys, if you'd be so kind.

55:38.602 --> 55:42.604
Oh, you have one hour.

55:42.606 --> 55:43.740
I'll be timing you.

55:45.643 --> 55:47.178
I must prepare my kitchen.

55:50.981 --> 55:53.448
One, two, three.

56:00.191 --> 56:02.459
The head, good, I need it.

56:37.026 --> 56:40.928
You look awful
pretty, don't you think?

56:40.930 --> 56:41.831
No, no, no.

56:45.335 --> 56:46.836
You don't like it?

57:05.088 --> 57:05.989
Bottoms up.

57:46.695 --> 57:47.529
Ta da!

57:51.967 --> 57:53.867
What is this?

57:53.869 --> 57:55.904
This is a date.

58:00.775 --> 58:02.441
I know what you're thinking.

58:02.443 --> 58:05.010
You're like, there's no point.

58:05.012 --> 58:08.047
He's deader than last
season's La Boheme.

58:08.049 --> 58:13.054
But you see to me, Haley,
dead is very stimulating.

58:15.356 --> 58:17.890
And thanks to the ginseng
and phenethylamine

58:17.892 --> 58:22.697
I slipped in the wine, there
is a point, a very stiff point.

58:31.906 --> 58:32.907
You want to do what?

58:39.280 --> 58:40.114
You cad.

58:45.318 --> 58:46.918
You're fucking crazy.

58:46.920 --> 58:49.989
Now now, Haley,
sit back and enjoy.

58:51.157 --> 58:55.228
I mean, after all,
you have had worse.

59:06.773 --> 59:10.643
Good girls always
listen to their superiors.

59:12.612 --> 59:14.714
You know that, don't you?

59:18.017 --> 59:18.853
No!

59:27.494 --> 59:30.628
She's having fun
up there, isn't she?

59:30.630 --> 59:32.132
She always does.

59:34.466 --> 59:36.633
Don't you have to
prepare the altar?

59:36.635 --> 59:37.569
Indeed, I do.

59:38.570 --> 59:39.538
You finish up here.

59:41.907 --> 59:43.609
But I still have
to get dressed.

59:49.047 --> 59:50.215
Floral cunt.

59:56.856 --> 01:00:01.360
I've heard your words, and
I bow before your wisdom.

01:00:07.834 --> 01:00:09.601
I have seen the path.

01:00:11.804 --> 01:00:13.639
I know what I must do.

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:24.649
Are you all right?

01:01:31.314 --> 01:01:32.516
I'm not an evil woman.

01:01:35.418 --> 01:01:37.785
I have urges like
everybody else.

01:01:37.787 --> 01:01:42.792
It's just that
mine are different.

01:01:49.466 --> 01:01:54.437
What I do comes from love,
like the love my daddy gave me.

01:02:02.111 --> 01:02:03.312
He owned a funeral home.

01:02:08.018 --> 01:02:11.253
And one sunny afternoon he
caught me in the basement

01:02:15.825 --> 01:02:16.659
with a girl.

01:02:25.969 --> 01:02:27.434
He said it was unnatural,

01:02:27.436 --> 01:02:31.173
and if I wanted something
unnatural, he'd give it to me.

01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:38.714
So he forced me on a dead man

01:02:44.086 --> 01:02:45.955
he was preparing for a viewing.

01:02:51.159 --> 01:02:52.627
He did it because he loved me.

01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:57.332
What I do comes from love.

01:02:59.634 --> 01:03:04.606
You see, to this day, the only
thing that makes me hornier

01:03:06.441 --> 01:03:10.812
than a beautiful
woman is a corpse.

01:03:16.618 --> 01:03:20.154
One of those inclinations
was born in me.

01:03:22.624 --> 01:03:23.993
The other was placed there.

01:03:31.867 --> 01:03:35.135
You're a disgusting
murderer, Agatha.

01:03:39.139 --> 01:03:42.476
That would be
Sebastian, not me.

01:03:43.911 --> 01:03:45.113
You are complicit.

01:03:49.616 --> 01:03:50.817
I suppose you got me there.

01:03:54.421 --> 01:03:57.823
Why don't you just kill
me and get it over with?

01:03:57.825 --> 01:03:59.992
Carmine told you why.

01:03:59.994 --> 01:04:02.494
I'm not the only
one who needs you.

01:04:02.496 --> 01:04:03.728
They're all waiting for you.

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:06.800
We're sharing ourselves
with you out of love.

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:11.202
By torturing me.

01:04:11.204 --> 01:04:12.040
Potato, potato.

01:04:19.947 --> 01:04:21.512
I have to go bathe.

01:04:21.514 --> 01:04:23.982
I have to go bathe.

01:04:23.984 --> 01:04:25.384
I'll be back in a bit, darling.

01:04:28.287 --> 01:04:32.959
Which sounds more appealing,
cherry blossom or lavender?

01:04:35.028 --> 01:04:36.029
Fuck you.

01:04:37.596 --> 01:04:41.465
You're right,
lavender.

01:04:41.467 --> 01:04:44.437
Sadie, your turn!

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:14.599
Herbs are amazing things.

01:05:17.203 --> 01:05:20.605
They grow and
sustain, they heal.

01:05:23.209 --> 01:05:24.409
Some can even kill.

01:05:26.212 --> 01:05:27.345
Do you have a favorite?

01:05:33.185 --> 01:05:34.019
Sage.

01:05:35.888 --> 01:05:38.623
Why should a man die who
has sage in his garden?

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:47.430
In the Middle Ages, it
was used to treat fevers.

01:05:47.432 --> 01:05:50.033
And according to the Angles,

01:05:50.035 --> 01:05:55.040
if one should eat it during
May, one would become immortal.

01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:03.148
The Romans associated it with
sacrifice, and the Dutch even

01:06:06.784 --> 01:06:11.789
traded it for Chinese
tea in the 17th century.

01:06:20.464 --> 01:06:21.298
A bad deal.

01:06:22.699 --> 01:06:25.270
The Chinese had far from
perfected tea at that point.

01:06:27.304 --> 01:06:28.139
Believe me.

01:06:36.014 --> 01:06:41.019
Sage mixed with certain
herbs and minerals

01:06:44.288 --> 01:06:48.892
can create something
truly unique.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.534
Something empowering.

01:07:18.255 --> 01:07:19.089
There we are.

01:07:35.503 --> 01:07:38.807
We better hurry, Carmine
will want his kitchen back.

01:07:48.217 --> 01:07:50.552
How could you do this him?

01:07:51.419 --> 01:07:52.353
What?

01:07:52.355 --> 01:07:54.824
How could you do this to us?

01:07:55.892 --> 01:07:58.125
Jeff sucked, Haley.

01:07:58.127 --> 01:08:00.727
- No.
- You know it and I know it.

01:08:00.729 --> 01:08:01.730
You're better off.

01:08:02.865 --> 01:08:04.064
- No.
- What the fuck

01:08:04.066 --> 01:08:05.201
were you doing with
that guy anyway?

01:08:09.238 --> 01:08:10.572
Open your mouth.

01:08:11.941 --> 01:08:12.774
No.

01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:17.278
This is meant to
empower you, to help you.

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:19.115
You'll need your strength later.

01:08:22.117 --> 01:08:23.749
- Haley.
- No.

01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:24.986
- Darling.
- No!

01:08:28.122 --> 01:08:30.457
You're spilling it, Haley.

01:08:37.332 --> 01:08:38.966
You'll feel better
soon, darling.

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:12.595
Shall we begin?

01:09:12.598 --> 01:09:16.301
After death, there are
several post-mortem changes.

01:09:16.303 --> 01:09:19.203
The regulatory systems,
oxygen intake, blood flow,

01:09:19.206 --> 01:09:22.374
waste removal, and so
on all come to a halt.

01:09:22.376 --> 01:09:25.911
Bacteria multiplies dissolving
the body from the inside out.

01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:29.014
Blood settles in various
low points in the body.

01:09:29.015 --> 01:09:30.514
The organs wilt,
the muscles stiffen.

01:09:30.515 --> 01:09:32.216
You with me so far?

01:09:32.219 --> 01:09:33.718
Good.

01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:38.491
Due to this process, it's
necessary that I work quickly.

01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:46.489
The flesh of any human being

01:10:46.491 --> 01:10:50.561
is almost always 30%
skin and 40% fat.

01:10:52.064 --> 01:10:56.700
The rest is muscle, which
we massage with olive oil.

01:11:03.275 --> 01:11:06.812
Yeah, and garlic.

01:11:11.216 --> 01:11:12.050
Pinch of salt.

01:11:13.251 --> 01:11:14.886
We don't want to dry it out.

01:11:17.289 --> 01:11:18.123
I like rosemary.

01:11:22.461 --> 01:11:25.696
The most important thing,
and don't you tell anyone,

01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:28.333
my secret spice mix.

01:11:37.607 --> 01:11:39.076
Now we're ready for the oven.

01:11:41.245 --> 01:11:42.513
Please just let me go.

01:11:44.747 --> 01:11:47.218
I won't tell anyone
anything, I swear.

01:11:50.521 --> 01:11:55.493
And miss dinner after all
the effort that went into it?

01:11:56.093 --> 01:11:58.062
No, I think not!

01:11:59.263 --> 01:12:01.830
To turn down a meal
of this magnitude

01:12:01.832 --> 01:12:04.001
would be nothing
less than sacrilege.

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:11.575
You can't make me eat this.

01:12:13.577 --> 01:12:16.213
Oh, Haley, what
do you have left?

01:12:17.414 --> 01:12:18.881
A few bad memories
and what I'm sure

01:12:18.883 --> 01:12:21.482
is a moderate collection
of off-the-rack sundresses.

01:12:21.484 --> 01:12:23.319
Is that anything
to look forward to?

01:12:26.389 --> 01:12:30.627
You're gonna get
caught, all of you.

01:12:32.929 --> 01:12:34.364
No, we won't.

01:12:35.764 --> 01:12:37.664
We're the dinner party.

01:12:37.666 --> 01:12:40.537
We are the untouchable elite.

01:12:46.976 --> 01:12:48.442
Time for church.

01:12:48.444 --> 01:12:50.611
Oh no, already?

01:12:50.613 --> 01:12:52.649
You know preparation
is my favorite part.

01:13:02.125 --> 01:13:03.558
Come back here!

01:13:13.101 --> 01:13:14.767
Please, please,
please help me!

01:13:14.769 --> 01:13:15.936
Please help me!

01:13:15.938 --> 01:13:17.103
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:13:17.105 --> 01:13:18.038
- Whoa, easy, easy.
- They killed my husband

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:18.704
and they're trying to kill me.

01:13:18.706 --> 01:13:19.705
We need to go.

01:13:19.707 --> 01:13:20.640
They're trying to kill me.

01:13:20.642 --> 01:13:22.741
You gotta calm down, ma'am.

01:13:22.743 --> 01:13:25.547
Take a breath, easy, easy.

01:13:26.714 --> 01:13:27.948
Now what's the problem?

01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:29.149
There's
no problem, Officer.

01:13:29.151 --> 01:13:30.083
No!

01:13:30.085 --> 01:13:32.352
Oh, you found her, thank God.

01:13:32.354 --> 01:13:34.554
He's one of them,
he killed my husband.

01:13:36.592 --> 01:13:37.790
Haley, calm down.

01:13:37.792 --> 01:13:39.526
She's my sister-in-law,
she's upset.

01:13:39.528 --> 01:13:41.895
A little anxiety attack
brought on by too much wine.

01:13:41.897 --> 01:13:42.829
That's bullshit!

01:13:42.831 --> 01:13:44.333
Hey, stop it, both of you.

01:13:45.733 --> 01:13:48.134
Now we're gonna stay calm and
we're gonna sort this out.

01:13:48.136 --> 01:13:49.135
You got it?

01:13:49.137 --> 01:13:50.537
Yes, sir.

01:13:50.539 --> 01:13:51.373
What happened?

01:13:52.773 --> 01:13:54.241
Is that blood?

01:13:54.243 --> 01:13:55.975
She has a mental condition.

01:13:55.977 --> 01:14:00.446
It's finger paint and
full-bodied red wine.

01:14:00.448 --> 01:14:03.215
Sir, I'm not addressing you.

01:14:03.217 --> 01:14:05.951
If I want information
from you, I'll ask you.

01:14:05.953 --> 01:14:08.222
Right now, I'm asking her.

01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:10.923
No problem.

01:14:10.925 --> 01:14:12.591
What's your name, ma'am?

01:14:12.593 --> 01:14:14.996
Haley, Haley Duncan.

01:14:16.464 --> 01:14:17.298
Mhm.

01:14:18.499 --> 01:14:20.935
And he killed my
husband in that house.

01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:24.169
That house?

01:14:24.171 --> 01:14:29.110
Yes, they chopped his head
off right in front of me,

01:14:29.844 --> 01:14:30.511
and they butchered him.

01:14:31.778 --> 01:14:32.611
Haley, I'm...

01:14:32.613 --> 01:14:33.447
Sir!

01:14:37.218 --> 01:14:38.152
So who's they, ma'am?

01:14:39.387 --> 01:14:41.353
Him and his friends.

01:14:41.355 --> 01:14:43.324
They're all fucking sick.

01:14:46.192 --> 01:14:51.197
Vincent and Agatha, Sadie
something, and Carmine, they're...

01:14:52.065 --> 01:14:54.232
Carmine, Carmine Braun?

01:14:54.234 --> 01:14:55.900
- Yes.
- The doctor.

01:14:55.902 --> 01:15:00.307
Yes, they're gonna
eat my husband.

01:15:01.775 --> 01:15:03.443
They're gonna
eat your husband?

01:15:07.013 --> 01:15:08.746
Like yum yum eat him up?

01:15:11.151 --> 01:15:12.550
They're gonna eat my husband.

01:15:15.355 --> 01:15:18.591
Well, I've never
heard of that one yet.

01:15:24.664 --> 01:15:26.264
What's your name, sir?

01:15:26.266 --> 01:15:27.634
Sebastian Todd, Officer.

01:15:29.035 --> 01:15:31.904
Well, what do you know
about all of this, Mr. Todd?

01:15:33.372 --> 01:15:37.743
Haley has a mental condition
and she's confused and angry.

01:15:40.479 --> 01:15:42.379
- You fucking liar!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:15:42.381 --> 01:15:44.648
- No, he killed my husband!
- Calm down!

01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:45.482
He's lying!

01:15:45.484 --> 01:15:46.318
Calm down!

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.722
Now what we have here are
two very conflicting reports.

01:15:51.724 --> 01:15:53.990
Now this is my regular patrol,

01:15:53.992 --> 01:15:57.831
and I have never known Dr.
Braun to cause any trouble.

01:16:04.203 --> 01:16:05.137
Excuse me.

01:16:12.144 --> 01:16:16.279
But on the other hand, Mr.
Todd, your sister-in-law here...

01:16:16.281 --> 01:16:17.614
I am not his sister-in-law.

01:16:17.616 --> 01:16:19.318
As you say she is

01:16:21.719 --> 01:16:25.523
has certainly experienced
something traumatic.

01:16:26.924 --> 01:16:28.726
So here's the game-plan, kids.

01:16:30.962 --> 01:16:34.997
Inside, both of you, now!

01:16:34.999 --> 01:16:36.000
Yes, sir.

01:17:05.363 --> 01:17:06.197
Out.

01:17:18.475 --> 01:17:19.309
Ma'am?

01:17:22.279 --> 01:17:26.283
No, I'm not going
back in that house.

01:17:27.384 --> 01:17:29.553
Ma'am, I'm an
officer of the law.

01:17:32.122 --> 01:17:34.124
I'll be right beside
you the whole time.

01:17:36.226 --> 01:17:37.527
You'll be more than safe.

01:17:45.569 --> 01:17:48.772
Haley, darling,
how are you feeling?

01:17:50.207 --> 01:17:51.475
Why she looks fine.

01:17:53.343 --> 01:17:54.177
Dr. Braun.

01:17:55.344 --> 01:17:57.711
Deputy, thank you for
returning my patient.

01:17:57.713 --> 01:18:00.581
I was just about to call 911.

01:18:00.583 --> 01:18:04.987
Mhm, seems we have a little
trouble we need to address.

01:18:07.756 --> 01:18:11.158
Seems Miss Duncan here
is under the impression

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.030
that you murdered her
husband and plan to eat him.

01:18:17.868 --> 01:18:19.366
Well yes, I suppose...

01:18:19.368 --> 01:18:23.036
What do I keep telling
you people over and over?

01:18:23.038 --> 01:18:26.408
No more ropes, scarves,
or any of that shit.

01:18:27.878 --> 01:18:29.376
See these?

01:18:29.378 --> 01:18:33.048
Solid steel, and they
never come untied.

01:18:34.885 --> 01:18:37.319
You folks who claim
to be so cultured,

01:18:38.754 --> 01:18:42.691
you sure do make a lot of
damn dumbass decisions.

01:18:44.058 --> 01:18:47.293
You are absolutely
correct, Deputy, as usual.

01:18:47.295 --> 01:18:49.997
I suppose we can
be slow of study.

01:18:49.999 --> 01:18:53.067
Preoccupied with certain
artistic flights of fancy.

01:18:54.335 --> 01:18:57.270
However, we can arrange
another place setting

01:18:57.272 --> 01:18:58.406
for a certain someone.

01:19:00.441 --> 01:19:01.607
I'm flattered, Doc.

01:19:01.609 --> 01:19:02.443
Hey!

01:19:03.913 --> 01:19:07.448
It's rude to leave a party
without thanking the host.

01:19:08.449 --> 01:19:09.684
Now get away from the door, now.

01:19:10.618 --> 01:19:12.019
Haley, love, relax.

01:19:12.021 --> 01:19:13.653
All will be fine.

01:19:13.655 --> 01:19:15.154
Just calm down now, Haley.

01:19:15.156 --> 01:19:17.091
Vincent, please.

01:19:18.126 --> 01:19:19.862
No, no, no, no, no.

01:19:29.004 --> 01:19:32.406
Stay away from me or I
will fucking kill you.

01:19:33.875 --> 01:19:38.880
Haley, Haley,
just calm down now.

01:19:41.515 --> 01:19:44.516
Here's what I need you
to understand right now.

01:19:44.518 --> 01:19:49.523
Right now there are two
paths spread out before you.

01:19:50.524 --> 01:19:55.095
Now the first path is painless.

01:19:56.496 --> 01:19:59.499
You drop the fire poker, you
come with me, the story ends.

01:20:01.836 --> 01:20:06.473
If you choose not to do
that, the second path,

01:20:07.608 --> 01:20:10.076
it's excruciatingly
fucking painful.

01:20:10.078 --> 01:20:11.178
I promise you that.

01:20:14.849 --> 01:20:15.682
It's up to you.

01:20:17.784 --> 01:20:21.220
I advise you, however,
to choose wisely.

01:20:29.395 --> 01:20:31.528
Now did I tell you?

01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:32.632
Give me that.

01:21:06.833 --> 01:21:07.666
Enough.

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:12.303
We need her, the
ceremony requires it.

01:21:16.508 --> 01:21:17.308
Go on.

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:06.858
Hallowed morning star,
accept our offering this night.

01:22:07.992 --> 01:22:10.661
Bathe us in your divine darkness

01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:15.466
and grant us your
unyielding power.

01:22:19.403 --> 01:22:20.738
Hail, light bringer.

01:22:22.406 --> 01:22:24.040
Hail, light bringer.

01:22:24.042 --> 01:22:26.209
Hail, light bringer.

01:22:26.211 --> 01:22:27.611
Hail, light bringer.

01:22:33.317 --> 01:22:36.718
Accept our sacrifice.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.722
Fill us with your spirit.

01:22:39.891 --> 01:22:41.658
We bow to your will.

01:22:42.994 --> 01:22:46.460
Imbue this flesh and
blood with your magic

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.232
and your inexorable might.

01:22:49.332 --> 01:22:51.201
Recognize our devotion.

01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:04.781
I, your high priestess, deem
this sacrifice acceptable

01:23:07.818 --> 01:23:09.820
and beg your blessing.

01:23:29.305 --> 01:23:34.309
And bless this vessel
bathed in your holy blood

01:23:35.477 --> 01:23:38.378
that it may become an
instrument of your will.

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:39.847
No!

01:23:50.092 --> 01:23:53.326
Let us
consume and be blessed.

01:23:53.328 --> 01:23:54.629
Are the followers willing?

01:23:56.032 --> 01:23:57.597
CARMINE, SEBASTIAN, AND
AGATHA: We are willing.

01:23:57.599 --> 01:23:58.400
Me first.

01:23:59.568 --> 01:24:01.037
I have steaks to sear.

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:09.145
May the lord of fire
keep you in his heart.

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:11.247
Praise be.

01:24:15.017 --> 01:24:18.551
May the lord of fire
keep you in his heart.

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:23.557
Praise be.

01:24:24.758 --> 01:24:26.793
May the lord of fire
keep you in his heart.

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:27.796
Praise be.

01:24:34.102 --> 01:24:36.604
And now a song of worship.

01:25:41.902 --> 01:25:44.138
The ceremony is at an end.

01:25:45.738 --> 01:25:48.608
Let us go forth and
serve our faith.

01:25:50.911 --> 01:25:53.414
Let's eat.

01:25:54.447 --> 01:25:56.548
May I present filet of Duncan.

01:26:03.689 --> 01:26:05.425
Carpaccio con riso.

01:26:10.330 --> 01:26:14.133
Haley, dear, you are in
for a very rare treat.

01:26:29.983 --> 01:26:30.984
Bon appetit.

01:26:37.256 --> 01:26:38.757
I want my pills.

01:26:44.495 --> 01:26:45.761
I need my pills.

01:26:45.763 --> 01:26:46.764
I need Jeff.

01:27:14.326 --> 01:27:17.628
I'm telling you, your
husband is delicious, darling.

01:27:18.763 --> 01:27:20.065
You're really missing out.

01:27:20.899 --> 01:27:22.866
She might need a little help.

01:27:22.868 --> 01:27:25.003
Nobody should be
left out of this.

01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:27.804
- No.
- Here, have some.

01:27:27.806 --> 01:27:29.305
No.

01:27:29.307 --> 01:27:32.408
How about if I bring
Mr. Airplane with it?

01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:34.176
Like I did with you.

01:27:39.517 --> 01:27:41.050
The fighter pilot.

01:27:42.319 --> 01:27:43.320
That's it.

01:27:44.455 --> 01:27:45.289
That's it.

01:27:52.797 --> 01:27:54.430
- Oh!
- Oh.

01:27:54.432 --> 01:27:55.765
What the fuck?

01:28:00.471 --> 01:28:01.736
What the fuck did you do?

01:28:01.738 --> 01:28:03.673
- I didn't do anything.
- Is she dead?

01:28:04.574 --> 01:28:05.409
Haley?

01:28:06.444 --> 01:28:08.179
- Haley?
- Haley?

01:28:09.246 --> 01:28:10.079
Haley?

01:28:10.081 --> 01:28:11.082
She's in shock.

01:28:13.517 --> 01:28:14.483
Okay, is that a...

01:28:15.886 --> 01:28:17.618
You fucking bitch!

01:29:00.330 --> 01:29:01.863
What did you do?

01:29:01.865 --> 01:29:03.564
What did you do?

01:29:03.566 --> 01:29:07.534
I gave her her power
back and then some.

01:29:07.536 --> 01:29:12.541
You fucking bitch!

01:29:14.176 --> 01:29:16.345
So what now?

01:29:18.547 --> 01:29:23.150
We wait here for Brooks.

01:29:23.152 --> 01:29:24.286
Bullshit.

01:29:25.621 --> 01:29:28.557
Brooks can do the paperwork,
we make the kills.

01:29:31.226 --> 01:29:32.928
First Haley, then Sadie.

01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:36.398
Are you sure that's wise?

01:29:38.834 --> 01:29:39.667
No.

01:29:43.771 --> 01:29:46.640
Brooks has a gun, Bastian.

01:29:46.642 --> 01:29:47.974
What do we have?

01:29:47.976 --> 01:29:49.578
Legitimate question.

01:30:05.326 --> 01:30:07.228
What are we gonna
do with the body?

01:30:09.363 --> 01:30:10.198
Compost?

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:13.935
For crying out loud.

01:30:14.869 --> 01:30:16.370
I need some fuckin' air.

01:31:13.326 --> 01:31:14.160
Oh shit.

01:31:16.329 --> 01:31:18.997
Looky looky, sugar cookie.

01:31:18.999 --> 01:31:22.068
You think you're
fuckin' clever, huh?

01:32:12.584 --> 01:32:14.318
Come in, thanks.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.654
What happened?

01:33:02.801 --> 01:33:04.600
Sheriff's department!

01:33:04.602 --> 01:33:05.503
Don't move!

01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:13.877
I said freeze!

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:32.553
Let me see.

01:34:32.555 --> 01:34:34.688
- Ah, fuck!
- Fuck.

01:34:34.690 --> 01:34:35.524
Fuck.

01:34:39.094 --> 01:34:40.694
Who did this to you?

01:34:40.696 --> 01:34:41.530
Sadie.

01:34:43.231 --> 01:34:44.132
I think I'm dying.

01:34:45.533 --> 01:34:46.766
You are not.

01:34:46.768 --> 01:34:47.901
- You are not dying.
- I'm fucking dying.

01:34:47.903 --> 01:34:49.870
- I'm gonna die.
- You are not dying.

01:34:49.872 --> 01:34:53.239
Where is she now?

01:34:53.241 --> 01:34:56.042
I don't know, she disappeared.

01:34:56.044 --> 01:34:59.612
Okay, okay, you're not dying.

01:34:59.614 --> 01:35:01.882
You're gonna stay
right behind me.

01:35:01.884 --> 01:35:03.819
Okay, come on, come on.

01:35:06.287 --> 01:35:08.356
Okay, come on, all right.

01:35:11.526 --> 01:35:13.226
It's on now.

01:35:35.482 --> 01:35:36.849
Fuck.

01:35:36.851 --> 01:35:38.049
Shh.

01:35:38.051 --> 01:35:40.420
- What the fuck is wrong...
- Shh.

01:36:48.588 --> 01:36:49.422
Carmine.

01:36:51.992 --> 01:36:52.826
Carmine.

01:36:56.897 --> 01:36:59.298
Oh, Carmine, can you hear me?

01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:04.503
Carmine.

01:37:12.477 --> 01:37:13.311
Fuck.

01:37:16.648 --> 01:37:17.482
Fuck.

01:38:00.457 --> 01:38:02.994
Nice, full-bodied red
they bought for $12.

01:38:59.016 --> 01:39:02.719
Pagliacci, my favorite opera.

01:39:04.188 --> 01:39:06.287
A theater troupe comes
to town to put on a play

01:39:06.289 --> 01:39:09.958
called The Troubles
of Pagliacci.

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:11.394
That's the title, right?

01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:15.997
Nedda, a member of the theater
troupe, is having an affair

01:39:15.999 --> 01:39:21.004
with Silvio, a real
man-about-town type.

01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:25.173
Her husband Canio,
who plays Pagliacci,

01:39:25.175 --> 01:39:28.578
finds out during the
play's performance.

01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:32.514
Right in the middle
of the performance.

01:39:33.682 --> 01:39:34.716
That's tough.

01:39:37.452 --> 01:39:40.921
The cuckolded Canio sings his
sad love song, pouring out

01:39:40.923 --> 01:39:45.228
all of his pain and shame
for all the world to see.

01:39:46.528 --> 01:39:50.933
He's not acting anymore,
and the crowd roars.

01:39:53.702 --> 01:39:55.637
He proceeds to kill
Nedda and Silvio.

01:39:58.007 --> 01:40:02.845
Right then and there, drenched
in the blood of his wife

01:40:04.781 --> 01:40:07.850
and her lover, he sings.

01:40:17.692 --> 01:40:21.328
The comedy is finished.

01:40:23.932 --> 01:40:28.937
Go home, be merry, or at
least go to Sardi's.

01:40:40.148 --> 01:40:41.249
That hurts.

01:40:51.525 --> 01:40:54.027
Go home and forget all about me,

01:40:54.029 --> 01:40:55.529
and I'll forget all about you.

01:40:57.933 --> 01:41:00.266
I know you've had
a hell of a night.

01:41:00.268 --> 01:41:01.368
We both have.

01:41:03.671 --> 01:41:06.841
But I know there's still
some reason in you.

01:41:12.378 --> 01:41:13.981
It's been an intense pleasure.

01:41:27.594 --> 01:41:28.428
Shit.

01:41:29.864 --> 01:41:34.532
Well, for the record, that
dress is a goddamn tragedy.

01:41:53.854 --> 01:41:55.487
Well played, love.

01:41:57.522 --> 01:41:58.791
Are you angry at me?

01:42:09.668 --> 01:42:11.170
You choose what's next.

01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:41.100
The answer to your question
is no, you are not crazy.

01:42:42.234 --> 01:42:43.235
And this isn't hell.

01:42:50.508 --> 01:42:54.612
I can heal your wounds
too, inside and out.

01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:59.382
What are you?

01:42:59.384 --> 01:43:00.518
Complicated question.

01:43:01.954 --> 01:43:05.157
I could tell you in words,
but it would take eons.

01:43:20.238 --> 01:43:21.807
Let's try this instead.

01:43:38.322 --> 01:43:39.924
You're the devil.

01:43:40.958 --> 01:43:43.225
No, no, not at all.

01:43:43.227 --> 01:43:48.232
I'm, or I was, back when
the Earth was a big garden.

01:43:51.969 --> 01:43:53.204
A sprawling paradise.

01:44:00.011 --> 01:44:01.310
You were...

01:44:01.312 --> 01:44:06.317
I was the first woman
forced into existence

01:44:08.752 --> 01:44:12.223
in order to breed with
a mound of mud and shit.

01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:18.594
Day after day, a servant
to maker and man.

01:44:21.965 --> 01:44:26.100
Then came the serpent, and
the serpent whispered to me,

01:44:26.102 --> 01:44:27.303
and my eyes were opened.

01:44:28.737 --> 01:44:33.376
I ate the fruit and savored
it for what it was, the truth.

01:44:35.512 --> 01:44:37.113
I was punished, of course.

01:44:38.782 --> 01:44:41.384
She shall become an
abode for jackals.

01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:47.157
And yes, I was cursed to walk
this Earth until the seas boil

01:44:48.391 --> 01:44:50.692
with only the blood
of man to sustain me.

01:44:53.963 --> 01:44:57.599
I was not cast out of the
garden, Haley, I left.

01:44:59.536 --> 01:45:01.237
I know what my choice meant.

01:45:02.671 --> 01:45:06.475
But to be a slave, even in
paradise, is no life at all.

01:45:14.416 --> 01:45:15.583
My father is listening.

01:45:17.152 --> 01:45:21.754
Right now, Haley, he is
everywhere and nowhere.

01:45:21.756 --> 01:45:24.893
He knows you suffer
just as I once did.

01:45:26.761 --> 01:45:28.030
I'm nothing like you.

01:45:28.997 --> 01:45:30.199
Of course you are.

01:45:31.934 --> 01:45:34.401
You married Jeff because
you felt you had to,

01:45:34.403 --> 01:45:35.771
and you came to dinner.

01:45:37.206 --> 01:45:40.641
And when things got bad, you
fought back just like before.

01:45:46.348 --> 01:45:50.383
I know all about it,
and I don't blame you.

01:45:50.385 --> 01:45:51.551
Not a bit.

01:45:51.553 --> 01:45:53.386
I know you had to lie

01:45:53.388 --> 01:45:55.890
just like you had to
kill your stepfather.

01:45:57.892 --> 01:46:02.430
He stole your childhood,
and you punished him for it.

01:46:04.265 --> 01:46:07.168
And your mother, she
couldn't protect you.

01:46:08.469 --> 01:46:09.935
She knew what was happening,

01:46:09.937 --> 01:46:12.273
and she couldn't move
herself to lift a finger.

01:46:13.608 --> 01:46:15.307
She got what she deserved,
we both know that.

01:46:15.309 --> 01:46:18.312
You freed her, you
freed yourself.

01:46:20.448 --> 01:46:22.281
I had no choice.

01:46:22.283 --> 01:46:24.649
Everyone has a choice, love.

01:46:24.651 --> 01:46:28.856
You chose to let Jeff
treat you like garbage.

01:46:30.258 --> 01:46:35.129
And if you had chosen to lay
down and die, that would be it.

01:46:35.762 --> 01:46:36.597
But you didn't.

01:46:38.566 --> 01:46:40.034
I see great things in you.

01:46:46.506 --> 01:46:50.510
So I can have it all for
the price of my soul, right?

01:46:51.478 --> 01:46:52.711
I don't want your soul.

01:46:55.215 --> 01:46:58.785
Haley, I want you by my side.

01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:03.223
I want love, pure
and unadulterated.

01:47:04.690 --> 01:47:06.927
Partner, aren't you
tired of feeling alone?

01:47:14.201 --> 01:47:15.035
I am.

01:47:17.037 --> 01:47:20.638
Together, we can live
fully and completely until

01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:25.645
the sky falls, the seas are
dry, and the sun turns to ash,

01:47:27.013 --> 01:47:30.115
when my father will welcome
us home with open arms.

01:47:41.393 --> 01:47:42.292
Choose.

01:48:07.052 --> 01:48:08.621
Welcome home, baby.

01:48:53.865 --> 01:48:55.031
Are we
sure about this?

01:48:55.033 --> 01:48:56.499
Why wouldn't we be?

01:48:56.501 --> 01:48:58.000
We don't really know them.

01:48:58.002 --> 01:49:00.670
That's why we're here,
babe, to get to know them.

01:49:00.672 --> 01:49:03.308
Plus they've got connections,
serious connections.

01:49:04.275 --> 01:49:05.642
Are you sure I look okay?

01:49:06.543 --> 01:49:07.442
Are you kidding?

01:49:07.444 --> 01:49:09.944
Tammy, honey, you look hot.

01:49:09.946 --> 01:49:13.014
It'll be all I can do not to
jump you on the dinner table.

01:49:13.016 --> 01:49:14.983
If they're lesbians,
they might object to that.

01:49:14.985 --> 01:49:17.187
Maybe, maybe not.

01:49:22.959 --> 01:49:24.061
Hi.

01:49:26.630 --> 01:49:27.564
That's weird.

01:49:49.787 --> 01:49:50.620
Gotcha.

01:49:54.990 --> 01:49:56.990
I had you, didn't I?

01:49:56.992 --> 01:49:58.225
You did.

01:49:58.227 --> 01:49:59.328
Completely.

01:50:01.063 --> 01:50:02.029
My apologies.

01:50:02.031 --> 01:50:04.734
My wicked streak runs deep.

01:50:07.670 --> 01:50:12.675
You must be Phil, and
you must be Tammy.

01:50:16.312 --> 01:50:18.714
I'm Haley, thank you for coming.

01:50:20.583 --> 01:50:22.051
We wouldn't have missed it.

01:50:23.252 --> 01:50:24.987
Would've been
a real shame if you had.

01:50:26.823 --> 01:50:30.259
And this is my wife, Sadie.

01:50:31.394 --> 01:50:32.428
The Rowlins, my love.

01:50:35.231 --> 01:50:38.165
Welcome, please make
yourselves at home

01:50:38.167 --> 01:50:40.835
while we finish
our preparations.

01:50:40.837 --> 01:50:42.836
I'm sure you're starving.

01:50:42.838 --> 01:50:43.638
Oh, we are.

01:50:44.606 --> 01:50:46.372
And we brought wine.

01:50:46.374 --> 01:50:47.175
How thoughtful.

01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:50.545
Welcome to our home.

01:50:51.413 --> 01:50:52.480
You can wait in there.

01:51:00.054 --> 01:51:02.357
Did you buy new candles
for the altar, baby?

01:51:04.692 --> 01:51:05.992
I always do.

01:51:05.994 --> 01:51:09.330
Good, now gimme a kiss.
