How I don't
get along with my mom.

18:30.909 --> 18:32.577
And how I never knew my father.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.145
How I'm 25 years old

18:34.147 --> 18:37.648
And living in the guest room
of a stranger's house.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.283
(sighs)

18:39.285 --> 18:41.352
I'm sorry.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.388
I didn't mean
to stir all this up. I just...

18:44.390 --> 18:47.558
And that's why
I don't need acting lessons.

18:50.762 --> 18:52.396
You know what?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.599
If you don't want

18:54.601 --> 18:58.002
To help yourself,
I can't force you.

18:59.004 --> 19:01.072
But the choices
that you make today

19:01.074 --> 19:04.075
Are going to affect you
for the rest of your life.

19:04.077 --> 19:06.577
And as long as you live
under my roof...

19:06.579 --> 19:08.146
Oh, god, kill me.

I can feel in your pants

19:16.656 --> 19:17.889
Is the shrimp that you stole.

19:17.891 --> 19:19.824
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm
just nervous.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.659
Can you do this or not?

19:21.661 --> 19:22.927
I don't think so.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.795
I mean, what would larry say?

19:24.797 --> 19:27.231
Larry:
<i>Come on, jeff. Don't quit.</i>

19:28.400 --> 19:30.201
What?

19:30.203 --> 19:31.669
I didn't say anything.

Larry:
<i>You can do it.</i>

19:33.406 --> 19:35.006
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

19:35.008 --> 19:37.575
You know what?
Maybe I can do this.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.743
Really?

19:38.745 --> 19:40.077
Larry:
<i>Attaboy.</i>

Tell me about it.

20:01.935 --> 20:04.735
Well, I went back
to the acting class.

Isn't that funny?

20:10.543 --> 20:12.543
That you didn't want to do

20:12.545 --> 20:15.613
Turned out to be the exact thing
that you should have done.

20:15.615 --> 20:18.749
Yeah, well, after about an hour
of that acting crap,

20:18.751 --> 20:20.284
I had to go get a drink.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.320
So, I bailed
and went to a bar

20:22.322 --> 20:23.888
Where I met a casting director.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.891
Turned out she was a lesbian,
so I had a leg up.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.361

I had an audition.
