WEBVTT

01:07.182 --> 01:08.753
Tight game here

01:08.788 --> 01:10.425
halfway through
the fourth quarter-- two points.

01:10.460 --> 01:11.987
Need a defensive stop.
Carlson cuts to the middle.

01:12.022 --> 01:14.022
Pick-and-roll,
alley-oop, slam dunk.

01:14.057 --> 01:15.265
Wow. What a play.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.025
That was easy. Beautiful pass...

01:18.798 --> 01:20.435
...halfway through
the fourth quarter-- two points.

01:20.470 --> 01:22.371
Need a defensive stop.
Carlson cuts to the middle.

01:22.406 --> 01:24.670
-Pick-and-roll, alley-oop,
slam dunk. -

01:24.705 --> 01:26.199
Wow. What a play. That was easy.

01:26.234 --> 01:29.037
Beautiful pass
from Carlson to Carriere.

01:31.206 --> 01:34.350
Do you know that you don't have
any soap in your bathroom?

01:34.385 --> 01:36.286
Oh, yeah, I got to pick some up.

01:37.454 --> 01:40.455
Do you want me to...
call you an Uber?

01:40.490 --> 01:42.292
No, I'm good.

01:42.327 --> 01:43.953
Lyft?

01:45.121 --> 01:48.463
No, I drove myself.
I'm on my way out.

01:48.498 --> 01:50.366
Ah.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.302
You-you need something?

01:55.901 --> 01:57.505
Just these.

01:58.574 --> 02:00.376
-Oh.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.938
-Oh, you like basketball?

02:01.973 --> 02:04.578
It's my job. I'm a coach.

02:04.613 --> 02:06.382
Oh, really? What, high school?

02:06.417 --> 02:07.977
Professional.

02:08.012 --> 02:09.550
In Des Moines?

02:09.585 --> 02:11.717
Iowa Stallions, J League.

02:11.752 --> 02:13.290
J League?

02:13.325 --> 02:16.084
Wow. So only like
four or five big promotions

02:16.119 --> 02:19.296
and you're all the way up
in the B League.

02:19.331 --> 02:21.760
That's good.

02:21.795 --> 02:23.564
-Truth be told,

02:23.599 --> 02:25.929
I should be coaching in the NBA.

02:25.964 --> 02:27.095
Then why aren't you?

02:28.439 --> 02:31.506
Because there's a lot of,
uh, politics involved and--

02:31.541 --> 02:34.938
Well, don't worry, darling.
I... I will be soon enough.

02:34.973 --> 02:36.940
"Darlin'"? Okay.

02:36.975 --> 02:41.648
Hey. That was fun.

02:41.683 --> 02:44.816
I, uh...
I think you're a great gal.

02:46.314 --> 02:47.621
-What?
-Nothing.

02:47.656 --> 02:49.359
You just-- you seem to think

02:49.394 --> 02:51.251
that I need some hand-holding
here, and I'm good.

02:51.286 --> 02:53.121
This is not my first time
swiping right.

02:53.156 --> 02:55.156
Apparently.

02:55.191 --> 02:58.368
Oh, no.
Did I hurt your feelings?

02:58.403 --> 03:00.799
-I'm trying to be
a nice guy here. -You are?

03:00.834 --> 03:02.669
Why are you being
such an asshole?

03:02.704 --> 03:05.034
You're focused on<i> SportsCenter,</i>
calling me "darling,"

03:05.069 --> 03:07.168
-and yet I'm the a...
-It's not<i> SportsCenter.</i>

03:07.203 --> 03:08.774
I have a big game tonight.

03:08.809 --> 03:12.272
I should've known I was in for
a real meeting of the minds

03:12.307 --> 03:15.176
when I saw you only had
one book in your apartment.

03:15.211 --> 03:17.552
I actually have many books.

03:17.587 --> 03:20.621
They're in storage.
I-I tend to travel light.

03:20.656 --> 03:23.459
And it's called
<i>Visualize Success.</i>

03:23.494 --> 03:25.692
-Powerful stuff.
-Hey.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.496
Don't knock visualization.

03:27.531 --> 03:28.959
-That stuff works.
-Yeah?

03:28.994 --> 03:29.927
Did you visualize this?

03:38.509 --> 03:42.577
No, I, uh, I visualized
you leaving a lot earlier.

03:46.110 --> 03:48.583
-Did you hear that?
-Wow, what a zinger.

03:55.350 --> 03:56.756
All right, guys,
keep it moving! Let's go!

03:56.791 --> 03:58.692
Get it down! Get it down there!

04:00.190 --> 04:01.398
You got to make that!

04:01.433 --> 04:04.093
Ross, rotate! Rotate!

04:04.128 --> 04:06.194
Hey, remind me why our
leading scorer's on the bench.

04:06.229 --> 04:08.768
Get your man!
Come on! Move the ball!

04:08.803 --> 04:11.166
All right, now, ge--
Timmy, box him out!

04:11.201 --> 04:12.838
Keep it moving! Defense!

04:12.873 --> 04:14.103
That's his second turnover.

04:17.141 --> 04:18.580
How many times
you gonna turn the ball over

04:18.615 --> 04:20.615
before we sit his ass down?

04:22.652 --> 04:24.080
Move!

04:24.115 --> 04:25.752
-Uh, put Derrick in for Moran.
-Post up!

04:27.382 --> 04:28.920
He doesn't listen to me.

04:28.955 --> 04:31.527
Are we trying to lose this game?

04:31.562 --> 04:32.253
I don't believe so.

04:32.288 --> 04:35.091
Trap! Trap! Trap!

04:35.126 --> 04:36.928
Why are we doubling
on the perimeter?

04:36.963 --> 04:39.601
They're passing out of it,
killing us three-on-two.

04:39.636 --> 04:42.395
I want them to figure out
how to defend the three on two.

04:42.430 --> 04:45.266
Yeah, well, they're not--
Rotate, damn it!

04:45.301 --> 04:46.399
Defense!
-Marcus.

04:46.434 --> 04:48.236
-Defense!
-Have a seat.

04:48.271 --> 04:50.711
-Defense! Defense!

04:50.746 --> 04:52.042
Rotate!

04:52.077 --> 04:54.946
Defense! Defense!

04:54.981 --> 04:56.310
Time-out! Time-out!

04:56.345 --> 04:57.982
Time-out!

04:58.017 --> 04:59.819
-Okay, guys. Bring it in.

04:59.854 --> 05:02.415
Bring it in. Come on.

05:02.450 --> 05:05.462
Don't forget,
Friday night is Kids' Night.

05:05.497 --> 05:06.958
We're running side-out-down.

05:06.993 --> 05:09.224
Inbound to Mike.
Timmy sets the screen.

05:09.259 --> 05:10.731
Jared, go in for the slam dunk.

05:10.766 --> 05:12.667
-Okay?
-No, not okay.

05:12.702 --> 05:14.999
-What?
-That's a terrible call, Phil.

05:15.034 --> 05:17.969
Marcus, it's my team.
You're my assistant.

05:18.004 --> 05:20.136
But I-I can get us
a better shot.

05:20.171 --> 05:21.907
I know how they defend
this situation.

05:21.942 --> 05:24.844
I watched it this morning.
We still inbound to Mike.

05:24.879 --> 05:26.648
Derrick, we're gonna run
the split action with you.

05:26.683 --> 05:29.651
Marcus. Marcus!
Go to the locker room.

05:29.686 --> 05:31.950
And let you blow
this possession? Hell no.

05:31.985 --> 05:33.413
-We inbound... -Okay, okay.
That's it. That's it.

05:33.448 --> 05:35.822
Get off the court. Go on.
Get off the court.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.923
-Okay, I'm going.

05:47.803 --> 05:50.364
All right. Okay, come on.

05:50.399 --> 05:52.300
We got a game to win, all right?

05:53.237 --> 05:54.841
You know, Jalen, we don't show

05:54.876 --> 05:56.436
a lot of J League highlights
on this show.

05:56.471 --> 05:58.977
Maybe we should.
It's the gateway to the NBA.

05:59.012 --> 06:01.551
It's full of freak athletes
making great plays.

06:01.586 --> 06:04.620
Yes, sir. They got
some springy dudes down there.

06:04.655 --> 06:07.117
Remember Marcus Marakovich?
Great young coach.

06:07.152 --> 06:08.954
Took Abilene Christian
to the Elite Eight.

06:08.989 --> 06:11.121
I remember.
Then he got the Ohio State job.

06:11.156 --> 06:12.287
Right. And then
he lost the Ohio State job

06:12.322 --> 06:14.960
for losing it
on one of his players.

06:14.995 --> 06:17.061
He bounced around
internationally for a while.

06:17.096 --> 06:19.998
Now he's an assistant coach
for the Iowa Stallions.

06:20.033 --> 06:22.539
Now, he didn't like
what the head coach drew up,

06:22.574 --> 06:25.234
and, look,
he goes all WWE on his boss.

06:25.269 --> 06:27.038
-Uh...
-No. Uh-oh.

06:27.073 --> 06:28.644
-Want me to turn it off?

06:28.679 --> 06:31.174
Mm, no. Turn it up.

06:31.209 --> 06:32.912
After all that nonsense,

06:32.947 --> 06:33.846
there's still six seconds
of basketball to be played,

06:33.882 --> 06:36.014
and this is where
we want to see the team

06:36.049 --> 06:37.917
rally around a coach,
execute the play, buzzer beater.

06:37.952 --> 06:39.182
Instead...

06:39.217 --> 06:41.888
Oh! Get that shot out of here!

06:41.923 --> 06:43.593
You had me going, SVP.

06:43.628 --> 06:45.485
I thought this story
had a nice ending.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.091
That wasn't nice.

06:47.126 --> 06:48.994
No, the block was nice,
but right now, no,

06:49.029 --> 06:50.864
nothing but bad news
for the Iowa Stallions

06:50.899 --> 06:52.393
and Marcus Marakovich.

06:52.428 --> 06:54.769
Turn it off.

06:56.608 --> 07:00.907
See? I told him
that play was horseshit.

07:00.942 --> 07:03.712
♪ Whiskey River,
take my mind... ♪

07:10.919 --> 07:13.348
Yo, Marcus.
You made<i> SportsCenter.</i>

07:13.383 --> 07:15.020
That's pretty cool.

07:15.055 --> 07:16.725
What an idiot.

07:16.760 --> 07:18.287
You're an idiot.

07:21.490 --> 07:23.226
Relax.

07:23.261 --> 07:25.569
Take a chill pill. I saw you.

07:28.497 --> 07:31.069
Poor bastards.

07:39.079 --> 07:40.650
Hey, thanks, man!

07:42.984 --> 07:45.721
Ah, shit.

08:07.679 --> 08:09.811
Marakovich?

08:09.846 --> 08:12.440
Let's go. You posted.

08:24.828 --> 08:27.994
Huh. You were the last person
I expected to see, Phil.

08:28.029 --> 08:30.832
We go back too far, Marcus.

08:30.867 --> 08:32.966
You know what a meme is?

08:33.001 --> 08:34.429
You're a meme now.

08:34.464 --> 08:36.134
My granddaughter
sent this to me.

08:36.169 --> 08:38.708
She's been sharing
with all her little friends.

08:38.743 --> 08:40.171
Finish him!

08:40.206 --> 08:42.712
Oh. At least it's pretty funny.

08:42.747 --> 08:45.044
No. It's not.

08:45.079 --> 08:46.881
It's not funny.

08:46.916 --> 08:48.278
All right. Okay.

08:48.313 --> 08:50.544
I-I messed up, obviously,

08:50.579 --> 08:52.447
and I... I'm sorry.

08:52.482 --> 08:55.857
-You don't sound sorry.
-Well, I am sorry.

08:55.892 --> 08:59.025
I mean, I'm not entirely sorry.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.126
I mean, should I apologize

09:01.161 --> 09:02.798
for wanting to win
a basketball game?

09:02.833 --> 09:04.624
By knocking me on my ass?

09:04.659 --> 09:07.737
Look, I... I'm frustrated
because you never listen to me.

09:07.772 --> 09:10.564
I told you
that lob play was dumb.

09:10.599 --> 09:12.841
If you'd have run
the split action with Derrick...

09:12.876 --> 09:15.338
Do you know why I didn't run
the play with Derrick?

09:15.373 --> 09:17.241
A misdirection maybe,

09:17.276 --> 09:19.309
but at least use him
as a decoy and...

09:19.344 --> 09:21.641
His grandmother
is in the hospital.

09:21.676 --> 09:23.753
She had a stroke.

09:23.788 --> 09:25.084
Mm. Okay.

09:25.119 --> 09:27.680
Well, I mean, she's old, right?

09:27.715 --> 09:30.551
It shouldn't matter, Marcus!
The woman raised him.

09:30.586 --> 09:33.554
Look, he was upset.
His head wasn't in the game.

09:33.589 --> 09:35.424
But you wouldn't know that

09:35.459 --> 09:37.866
because you don't bother
to get to know any of the guys.

09:37.901 --> 09:39.428
What do you mean?
I know the guys.

09:39.463 --> 09:41.936
I-I know
Jinky can't go to his left,

09:41.971 --> 09:43.597
Balanko is
strictly catch and shoot...

09:43.632 --> 09:47.172
As people! Human beings.

09:47.207 --> 09:49.570
Look, Marcus, you know the game

09:49.605 --> 09:55.279
better than anybody I have ever
played or coached with, but...

09:57.085 --> 09:59.052
...you got to learn
to build relationships, man.

09:59.087 --> 10:00.416
Okay.

10:00.451 --> 10:02.682
That-that is so adorable.

10:02.717 --> 10:04.959
What, are we living
in<i> Hoosiers</i> now,

10:04.994 --> 10:06.455
and I should go home and work on

10:06.490 --> 10:09.392
my inspirational
locker room speeches?

10:09.427 --> 10:11.460
You were a prick in college,
and you haven't changed.

10:11.495 --> 10:15.200
That's why
you never stick anywhere.

10:15.235 --> 10:18.269
Ohio State. Greece. Turkey.

10:18.304 --> 10:20.403
Oh, now, Turkey,
that was strictly

10:20.438 --> 10:22.273
a language barrier issue.

10:22.308 --> 10:24.814
You literally kicked a player
in his behind,

10:24.849 --> 10:26.574
bruised his coccyx.

10:26.609 --> 10:28.708
And he spoke English.
The kid was from Detroit.

10:28.743 --> 10:29.951
I get your point, okay?

10:29.986 --> 10:31.612
I'm gonna take the time,

10:31.647 --> 10:34.483
-and I'm gonna cultivate
relationships... -No. No.

10:34.518 --> 10:36.320
-No, I'll get to...
-Marcus.

10:36.355 --> 10:38.322
You're fired.

10:38.357 --> 10:40.324
It came down
from the front office.

10:43.868 --> 10:45.395
McGURK (mispronounces):
<i>Marcus Marakovich?</i>

10:45.430 --> 10:47.166
Uh, Marakovich.

10:47.201 --> 10:49.300
Attorney Charlie McGurk.
I'm gonna be representing you.

10:49.335 --> 10:51.104
Oh, good.

10:51.139 --> 10:53.073
So am I in a lot of trouble?

10:53.108 --> 10:54.910
-Not with me in your corner
you're not. -

10:54.945 --> 10:56.274
Okay? You relax.

10:56.309 --> 10:57.814
I do ten
of these DUI cases a day,

10:57.849 --> 10:59.475
Mr. Marakovich.

10:59.510 --> 11:01.741
This is gonna be quick
and hopefully painless.

11:01.776 --> 11:03.248
Okay? You let me do my thing.

11:03.283 --> 11:05.415
We get you out of here
with a fine and...

11:05.450 --> 11:07.450
Fist me!

11:07.485 --> 11:09.650
-What?

11:09.685 --> 11:11.289
The judge.

11:11.324 --> 11:13.786
We got Mary Menendez.
"Hanging Mary."

11:13.821 --> 11:15.458
"Hanging Mary"?

11:15.493 --> 11:16.789
She's the toughest judge
in Des Moines.

11:16.824 --> 11:18.461
She's a real stickler.

11:18.496 --> 11:20.463
And she does not like
drunk drivers.

11:20.498 --> 11:22.036
Oh, son of a bitch.

11:22.071 --> 11:25.435
Whoa, whoa. No boo-boo words.

11:25.470 --> 11:28.372
Okay? There's no swearing of any
kind in Menendez's courtroom.

11:28.407 --> 11:30.275
Just let me do
the talking, okay?

11:30.310 --> 11:31.848
Unless you're addressed
directly by the judge,

11:31.883 --> 11:33.509
-don't say a word.
-Okay.

11:33.544 --> 11:35.984
And try to look pathetic.

11:37.152 --> 11:38.745
Yeah, there you go.
That's perfect.

11:40.056 --> 11:42.023
Can you fake a limp?

11:42.058 --> 11:43.992
I'm not doing that.

11:44.027 --> 11:46.060
Okay, I'm gonna ask you this,
and I need you to be honest.

11:46.095 --> 11:48.128
Are you drunk right now?

11:48.163 --> 11:49.723
No, I'm not drunk.

11:49.758 --> 11:52.231
Okay, good,
'cause I've had several.

11:52.266 --> 11:53.969
One of us needs to be straight.

11:54.004 --> 11:56.499
Get your game face on.

11:56.534 --> 11:58.204
Driving with
a blood-alcohol level

11:58.239 --> 12:00.239
three times the legal limit,

12:00.274 --> 12:01.669
damaging a police vehicle,
resisting arrest.

12:01.704 --> 12:05.739
No. Uh, I just, uh, asked
for their badge numbers.

12:05.774 --> 12:06.707
I didn't resist.

12:06.742 --> 12:08.346
Ow!

12:08.381 --> 12:10.414
I told you
to let me do the talking.

12:10.449 --> 12:13.890
You just smacked me.
I'm just telling the truth.

12:13.925 --> 12:15.892
- Dickweed.
-Boo-boo word.

12:15.927 --> 12:17.190
Mr. Marakovich,
would you like me

12:17.225 --> 12:18.994
to add contempt of court
to the list?

12:19.029 --> 12:21.359
Because it seems to me
you have enough charges as is.

12:21.394 --> 12:23.163
No, Judge, that's plenty.

12:23.198 --> 12:24.164
It's "Your Honor."

12:24.199 --> 12:26.232
Your Honor. Sorry.

12:26.267 --> 12:29.532
I'm gonna make you an offer,
Mr. Marakovich.

12:29.567 --> 12:31.941
Now, I understand you are
a professional basketball coach.

12:31.976 --> 12:33.206
Is that correct?

12:33.241 --> 12:35.945
-Uh, yes, Your Honor.
-Okay.

12:35.980 --> 12:37.947
In light of that information,

12:37.982 --> 12:39.740
I will offer you
community service:

12:39.775 --> 12:41.280
coaching at a local rec center.

12:41.315 --> 12:43.249
Community service?
I-- No, I can't...

12:43.284 --> 12:46.120
-Uh, a moment to confer,
Your Honor. -Yes.

12:46.155 --> 12:47.924
Just shut up,
you lucky son of a bitch.

12:47.959 --> 12:49.519
I'm not feeling lucky.

12:49.554 --> 12:50.927
She said community service.

12:50.962 --> 12:52.885
-That's the ju...
-But community service?

12:52.920 --> 12:55.096
I need to be in other cities
wh-where I'm gonna be working.

12:55.131 --> 12:56.757
-I can't stay in Des Moines.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.792
I-I can't take
community service.

12:58.827 --> 13:01.729
Oh. You can't take
community service? Okay.

13:01.764 --> 13:03.830
So, uh,
with that in mind, then...

13:05.339 --> 13:06.635
...you are hereby sentenced
to serve

13:06.670 --> 13:08.901
18 months incarceration
in prison.

13:08.936 --> 13:10.540
Time to be served at...

13:10.575 --> 13:13.378
Uh, uh, I-I-I do apologize,
uh, Your Honor.

13:13.413 --> 13:14.709
I think there's some kind of
misapprehension here because

13:14.744 --> 13:18.251
-we were talking about...
I said... -Hmm?

13:18.286 --> 13:21.584
We both were talking when you
said, "Take community service."

13:21.619 --> 13:23.784
I don't... I don't want
to take comm--

13:23.819 --> 13:25.786
I want to give to the community.

13:25.821 --> 13:27.722
I want to give freely.

13:27.757 --> 13:31.132
I'm all ears.
Wh-What did you have in mind?

13:31.167 --> 13:32.397
Good decision, Mr. Marakovich.

13:32.432 --> 13:34.168
As I was saying,

13:34.203 --> 13:38.733
I will offer you
90 days' community service,

13:38.768 --> 13:41.472
coaching adults
with intellectual disabilities

13:41.507 --> 13:44.277
at The Friends Association
in Capitol East.

13:44.312 --> 13:45.982
Um, Your Honor?

13:46.017 --> 13:48.446
Uh, when you say
"intellectual disabilities,"

13:48.481 --> 13:50.085
what are we talking here?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.911
-Uh...
-Yes?

13:51.946 --> 13:54.155
-Are we talking retar...
-Oh.

13:54.190 --> 13:56.421
-...ded Americans?

13:56.456 --> 14:00.029
Because, y-you know,
it seems kind of redundant

14:00.064 --> 14:03.956
that, you know, in a sense,
Americans, we are re--

14:03.991 --> 14:06.134
you know, we're-we're those--

14:06.169 --> 14:09.005
I-I'm talking about myself,
too, you know? I'm a...

14:09.040 --> 14:10.039
Your Honor, I just have
to state for the record,

14:10.074 --> 14:14.010
I literally just met
"What's His Pickle" here

14:14.045 --> 14:15.968
20 minutes ago. Okay?

14:16.003 --> 14:17.640
I don't think his words should
reflect on me going forward,

14:17.675 --> 14:20.115
future hearings.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.512
No, I-I just-- I-I want to say

14:21.547 --> 14:23.382
the right thing,
but I don't know--

14:23.417 --> 14:27.617
If I can't say the "R" word,
what-what do I, uh, call them?

14:27.652 --> 14:30.818
May I suggest you call them
by their names?

14:34.164 --> 14:37.693
That's, uh... that's very
astute, Your Honor.

14:43.569 --> 14:45.503
-Come on.

15:04.051 --> 15:05.589
Gentlemen!

15:05.624 --> 15:07.591
Can you come this way?

15:22.443 --> 15:24.641
Okay. Right. Yeah, come on up.

15:34.488 --> 15:37.786
Okay, fellas,
my name is Marcus Marakovich,

15:37.821 --> 15:39.854
and I am going to be
your basketball coach

15:39.889 --> 15:41.053
for the next three months.

15:41.088 --> 15:42.758
-Nope.

15:42.793 --> 15:45.365
Wait. What?

15:45.400 --> 15:47.466
I said, "Nope."

15:52.143 --> 15:53.703
Is this something
he normally does?

15:53.738 --> 15:55.243
Nope.

15:55.278 --> 15:57.608
That's Darius.
He's our best player.

15:59.744 --> 16:01.117
I'm Johnny.

16:01.152 --> 16:03.713
I'm your homey
with an extra chromey.

16:03.748 --> 16:04.714
Whoa.

16:04.749 --> 16:06.386
I love animals.

16:06.421 --> 16:08.784
My sister's an actress.
My dog's name is Peaches.

16:08.819 --> 16:11.556
Johnny, that-that is
one funky musk

16:11.591 --> 16:13.129
you got going there, brother.

16:13.164 --> 16:15.461
What do you say we end this hug
right about now?

16:15.496 --> 16:16.792
Okay.

16:16.827 --> 16:18.596
Wow.

16:18.631 --> 16:19.894
Whew. Okay.

16:19.929 --> 16:21.566
My eyes are watering.

16:21.601 --> 16:23.898
Let's, uh, let's take a knee.

16:23.933 --> 16:26.274
Coach, I didn't know
we'd be kneeling,

16:26.309 --> 16:27.770
so I didn't wear my knee pads,

16:27.805 --> 16:29.475
and I'm worried about
my patella.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.939
Your patella?
Okay, well, you can stand.

16:31.974 --> 16:33.611
-Thanks.
-That's Marlon.

16:33.646 --> 16:35.184
He speaks Mandarin Chinese.

16:36.187 --> 16:37.516
Huh.

16:37.551 --> 16:39.287
That's Benny.

16:39.322 --> 16:41.520
-He works in the best
restaurant in town. -O-Okay.

16:41.555 --> 16:43.786
Uh, there's plenty of time
to get acquainted later, Johnny,

16:43.821 --> 16:47.163
but for now, let's everybody,
uh, partner up.

16:47.198 --> 16:49.627
Uh, Coach?
I don't need a partner.

16:49.662 --> 16:51.123
I've got a girlfriend.

16:51.158 --> 16:52.795
Wonderful.

16:52.830 --> 16:54.599
Actually, I got two.

16:54.634 --> 16:56.271
No, you don't.

16:56.306 --> 16:59.340
It's the same girl.
She just changes her hair.

16:59.375 --> 17:01.276
And she knows how to get around.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.036
Oh, now, now. Whoa. Whoa.

17:03.071 --> 17:04.774
-Take it easy.

17:04.809 --> 17:06.776
So what?

17:06.811 --> 17:08.811
Why can't she have
a lot of boyfriends?

17:08.846 --> 17:10.714
I've got two girlfriends.

17:10.749 --> 17:12.320
-No, you don't.

17:12.355 --> 17:14.949
They're best friends.

17:14.984 --> 17:16.885
They live in a group home.
I'm gonna live there, too.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.293
Okay, Johnny.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.691
Um... I'll tell you what.

17:20.726 --> 17:22.627
Let's everybody stand up.

17:22.662 --> 17:25.300
We're gonna do a little drill.

17:25.335 --> 17:28.028
Uh, you guys, uh,
Snap, Crackle and Pop...

17:30.901 --> 17:33.737
Snap, Crackle and Pop!
That's not their names!

17:33.772 --> 17:36.575
Yeah, I'm Craig. This is Cody.

17:36.610 --> 17:38.313
-I'm Blair.
Okay.

17:38.348 --> 17:41.349
Craig, Cody, Blair,
we're going to do

17:41.384 --> 17:43.714
a simple ball-handling exercise.

17:43.749 --> 17:45.353
Uh, my girlfriend loves those.

17:45.388 --> 17:47.146
Oh, my God.

17:47.181 --> 17:49.016
Can you just forget
your girlfriend for a minute?

17:49.051 --> 17:50.391
You can play with her later.

17:50.426 --> 17:53.053
We don't play. We have sex.

17:53.088 --> 17:56.089
I go to her place, and we do it.

17:56.124 --> 17:58.432
-All the sex moves.
-Mm-hmm.

18:09.544 --> 18:10.675
Okay.

18:10.710 --> 18:12.974
Watch, Coach.

18:14.142 --> 18:17.517
Big balls. Yeah.

18:17.552 --> 18:19.112
What's that guy's deal?

18:19.147 --> 18:21.752
-Showtime? He's a specialist.
-A specialist?

18:21.787 --> 18:23.622
Yeah, he's the only player
in the league

18:23.657 --> 18:26.493
who shoots backwards from half
court, and he's on our team.

18:26.990 --> 18:29.562
Pretty good shot, huh, Coach?

18:29.597 --> 18:32.125
No, that's a terrible shot.

18:34.965 --> 18:37.273
Now, that's a good shot.

18:37.308 --> 18:38.802
Looking good there, Darius.

18:38.837 --> 18:41.134
Nope. I'm not playing for you.

18:57.328 --> 18:59.559
This is impossible.

18:59.594 --> 19:01.055
Hey, don't worry about it.

19:01.090 --> 19:03.728
You'll have them all done
before you know it.

19:03.763 --> 19:06.830
No, no,
I-I'm talking about the team.

19:06.865 --> 19:10.306
It-It's impossible
to coach these guys.

19:10.341 --> 19:13.166
You know,
impossible is not a fact.

19:13.201 --> 19:14.772
It's an opinion.

19:14.807 --> 19:18.512
Please don't quote
cat posters to me.

19:18.547 --> 19:21.350
Look, Marcus, they're
Special Olympics athletes.

19:21.385 --> 19:24.012
You don't have to turn them
into the Lakers.

19:24.047 --> 19:26.520
They just need
to feel like a team.

19:26.555 --> 19:28.280
You know, I snuck
a couple peeks in there today.

19:28.315 --> 19:29.754
It looks like
you were doing good.

19:29.789 --> 19:30.821
Doing good?

19:30.856 --> 19:32.823
I-I didn't coach any basketball.

19:32.858 --> 19:35.188
I was mostly hearing about
Craig's girlfriend.

19:35.223 --> 19:37.333
Uh-huh. Huh. I hear he has two.

19:37.368 --> 19:39.599
Well, it's not clear.

19:39.634 --> 19:41.964
You know, the one guy
who can actually play

19:41.999 --> 19:43.196
won't play for me.

19:43.231 --> 19:45.297
Yeah, Darius.

19:45.332 --> 19:46.804
Ah, you know what?

19:46.839 --> 19:49.004
I... I don't, I don't care.

19:49.039 --> 19:51.270
I-I just...

19:53.582 --> 19:55.978
By the way,
what-what happened to the guy

19:56.013 --> 19:57.518
who was coaching before me?

19:57.553 --> 20:00.455
Oh, we don't talk about him.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.457
They kill him?

20:02.492 --> 20:03.623
No.

20:03.658 --> 20:05.020
No, no.

20:05.055 --> 20:06.021
He quit before
the season was over.

20:06.056 --> 20:08.320
The team was very upset.

20:08.355 --> 20:10.223
Right.

20:10.258 --> 20:11.730
But we won't have
that problem with you

20:11.765 --> 20:13.996
because we've got you
for 90 days.

20:14.031 --> 20:15.063
Guaranteed.

20:15.098 --> 20:17.065
Yeah.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.407
90 days.

20:19.839 --> 20:21.509
Very psyched.

20:26.010 --> 20:30.452
♪ Sometimes I miss a step ♪

20:32.016 --> 20:35.358
♪ I stumble here and there ♪

20:36.922 --> 20:42.596
♪ I'm finding my way home ♪

20:47.262 --> 20:48.404
♪ If I'm lost... ♪

20:48.439 --> 20:49.405
Hi, Coach!

20:51.299 --> 20:52.507
Johnny, right?

20:52.542 --> 20:54.410
Do you have a guinea pig?

20:54.445 --> 20:55.675
No.

20:55.710 --> 20:57.512
I do. Do you want a ride?

20:57.547 --> 21:01.043
Who's driving?
Not your guinea pig, I hope.

21:01.078 --> 21:02.616
Honeybun can't drive.

21:02.651 --> 21:04.343
Come on.

21:04.378 --> 21:06.455
All right.

21:09.559 --> 21:12.384
Thanks for the lift.
Kind of chilly out there.

21:12.419 --> 21:13.594
I'm freezing my balls off.

21:13.629 --> 21:15.563
This is my sister, Alex.

21:15.598 --> 21:17.433
She's my best friend.

21:17.468 --> 21:19.061
Ah. Well, nice to meet you, Al--

21:19.096 --> 21:21.470
Oh!

21:21.505 --> 21:24.968
-What's the matter?
-What's the matter?

21:25.003 --> 21:26.970
No, n-nothing.

21:27.005 --> 21:29.203
No. No, i-it's-- she--

21:29.238 --> 21:31.711
your, uh-- she...

21:31.746 --> 21:35.748
Sh-She looks a lot like
someone I used to know.

21:35.783 --> 21:38.212
-Do I? Huh. Well...

21:38.247 --> 21:41.589
It's very nice to meet you
for the first time, Coach.

21:41.624 --> 21:43.492
Yeah. (stammers) Marcus.

21:43.527 --> 21:46.385
Marcus. Wow, that's really
a nice name, Marcus.

21:46.420 --> 21:49.157
Hey, listen, Marcus,
you coach The Friends?

21:49.192 --> 21:50.664
-Is that what I'm hearing?
-Uh, yep.

21:50.699 --> 21:52.468
Yep, I, uh...

21:52.503 --> 21:54.327
Kind of a funny story, really.

21:54.362 --> 21:56.296
Yeah? Tell me.

21:56.331 --> 21:58.507
Yeah, well, I mean, it's...

22:00.775 --> 22:02.005
It's not "ha ha" funny.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.941
It's not even-- It's not funny.

22:03.976 --> 22:05.679
It didn't seem like it was
going anywhere funny.

22:05.714 --> 22:07.175
-Coach, do you want to do

22:07.210 --> 22:08.517
carpool karaoke with us?

22:08.552 --> 22:10.409
Uh, no. You know what?

22:10.444 --> 22:12.312
I-I don't like carpool kara--
I don't like karaoke...

-That sucks.
-Yeah.

22:50.924 --> 22:52.693
But at least
we're finally hanging out.

22:52.728 --> 22:54.189
You got a great place here.

22:54.224 --> 22:55.630
Yep.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.126
Uh, hey, by the way,

22:57.161 --> 22:58.633
let me ask you something.

22:58.668 --> 23:02.197
-I cannot stay out
the entire season. -Mm-mm.

23:02.232 --> 23:05.332
And I've been working
my, uh, connections,

23:05.367 --> 23:07.334
but it occurs to me that

23:07.369 --> 23:10.843
your uncle is one of the most
respected GMs in basketball.

23:10.878 --> 23:15.474
And is it possible you could
talk to him and help me out?

23:15.509 --> 23:16.750
Absolutely.

23:16.785 --> 23:18.587
Yeah?

23:18.622 --> 23:21.051
-Yeah.
-Oh.

23:21.086 --> 23:24.054
But I don't want it
to be, you know, minor league.

23:24.089 --> 23:27.596
-I-I want it to be the NBA.
-Yeah.

23:27.631 --> 23:30.258
You know, fifth assistant,
uh, player development,

23:30.293 --> 23:32.425
whatever it is, NBA.

23:32.460 --> 23:34.328
Gotcha. I'm on it.

23:34.363 --> 23:35.604
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

23:36.706 --> 23:38.101
I knew it. I knew it.

23:38.136 --> 23:39.498
-You're the man.
-You're the man.

23:39.533 --> 23:40.840
-No, you're the man.
-No.

23:40.875 --> 23:43.744
Sir, you are the man.

23:45.308 --> 23:47.374
All right, I am the man.

23:47.409 --> 23:48.848
-You're right.

23:48.883 --> 23:51.114
Hey, you know what?

23:51.149 --> 23:54.084
After I talk to my uncle,
we should go out.

23:54.119 --> 23:56.592
Hit the clurb.
Get crunk. Get crazy.

23:56.627 --> 23:57.923
-And I'll give you the update.

23:57.958 --> 23:59.793
Listen.

23:59.828 --> 24:01.630
I got an idea.

24:01.665 --> 24:02.763
Text me.

24:02.798 --> 24:04.798
Lunch, then.

24:07.066 --> 24:09.429
Okay, guys,
today we're gonna work on

24:09.464 --> 24:11.365
the fundamentals of passing.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.708
Arthur, come over here,
help me out.

24:13.743 --> 24:16.810
All right? Now, we're gonna
start with the bounce pass.

24:16.845 --> 24:18.075
You ready?

24:19.243 --> 24:20.979
Okay, you see that?

24:21.014 --> 24:23.476
Thumbs behind the ball,
flick of the wrist, bounce pass.

24:23.511 --> 24:25.280
Right? Got it?

24:25.315 --> 24:26.919
Okay, throw it
back to me, Arthur.

24:26.954 --> 24:28.415
Good. Good.

24:28.450 --> 24:30.384
Now we're going to do
the chest pass.

24:30.419 --> 24:32.661
Same thing, no bounce.

24:32.696 --> 24:34.729
Got it? Nice.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.830
Hey, Coach, your shoe's untied.

24:38.361 --> 24:39.800
-Made you look.

24:39.835 --> 24:41.296
Oh, that's very funny. Yeah.

24:45.302 --> 24:47.500
Arthur, what the hell?

24:47.535 --> 24:49.271
Sorry, Coach.

24:49.306 --> 24:50.778
Uh, wasn't I supposed
to toss it back to you?

24:50.813 --> 24:52.604
Yeah, but the guy
has to be ready.

24:52.639 --> 24:54.342
-That's a crucial part
of this... -

24:54.377 --> 24:55.607
Uh...

24:55.642 --> 24:57.477
Oh, all right. Uh, hang on.

24:57.512 --> 24:59.149
You guys, uh, shoot around
a little bit.

24:59.184 --> 25:00.821
I'll be right back.

25:00.856 --> 25:02.823
-Ball, ball, ball.
Kenny.

25:02.858 --> 25:04.924
How you doing, buddy?

25:04.959 --> 25:07.619
How's everything going
in, uh, Seattle?

25:07.654 --> 25:08.664
Yeah? Oh--

25:08.699 --> 25:10.457
Hey! What the hell?!

25:12.802 --> 25:15.429
Yeah, no, I'm okay.
I'll call you right back.

25:15.464 --> 25:16.705
Guys, what are you doing?

25:16.740 --> 25:17.233
Shooting around.

25:20.073 --> 25:22.304
-Big balls.
-What am I looking at here?

25:22.339 --> 25:23.811
Big balls celebration,

25:23.846 --> 25:26.143
like when an NBA player
hits a big shot.

25:26.178 --> 25:27.507
Big balls.

25:27.542 --> 25:29.179
Oh, but you got to hit
the shot, right?

25:29.214 --> 25:30.719
I mean, you don't celebrate
a miss.

25:30.754 --> 25:33.821
Showtime does.
He knows all the celebrations.

25:33.856 --> 25:35.383
He's a student of the game.

25:35.418 --> 25:37.187
Aha.

25:37.222 --> 25:38.859
Watch this.

25:38.894 --> 25:41.554
Do shimmies. Steph Curry.

25:41.589 --> 25:42.797
Look at that.

25:42.832 --> 25:44.128
Aha.

25:46.770 --> 25:48.836
That is outstanding.

25:48.871 --> 25:50.970
Hey, uh...

25:51.005 --> 25:54.875
has he ever actually hit
one of those backward shots?

25:54.910 --> 25:56.910
In the five years
I've played with him,

25:56.945 --> 26:00.342
he's never even hit the rim,
but he's due.

26:00.377 --> 26:01.277
-Huh.
-Mm-hmm.

26:03.919 --> 26:05.413
Huh, pretty impressive.

26:08.385 --> 26:09.890
Hey.

26:09.925 --> 26:11.419
Sounded like
you guys were having fun

26:11.454 --> 26:13.762
-out there today, huh?
-Yeah. Yeah.

26:13.797 --> 26:15.731
Well, Arthur gave me
a concussion,

26:15.766 --> 26:18.228
but, uh, yeah,
other than that, pretty fun.

26:18.263 --> 26:20.659
Oh. Well, we don't have
any insurance,

26:20.694 --> 26:22.331
so I never heard that.

26:24.401 --> 26:26.698
Bye, Julio.
See you Thursday, Coach.

26:26.733 --> 26:28.106
Okay, Benny.

26:28.141 --> 26:30.108
You be good.

26:30.143 --> 26:32.209
Please tell me
he's not gonna ride that thing.

26:32.244 --> 26:33.540
Well, sure.

26:33.575 --> 26:35.509
I mean, he lives
all the way across town,

26:35.544 --> 26:38.215
so he comes back and forth
on that scooter every day.

26:38.250 --> 26:41.086
I mean, he's gonna
kill himself. All that ice.

26:41.121 --> 26:44.760
Well, as far as I know, he's
never had a single accident.

26:44.795 --> 26:46.828
Uh, can you say the same?

26:47.831 --> 26:49.721
Touché.

26:49.756 --> 26:52.460
These guys are capable
of a lot more than you think.

26:52.495 --> 26:54.099
You'd be surprised.

26:56.466 --> 26:57.806
<i>Like Benny, for instance.</i>

26:57.841 --> 26:59.632
<i>He lives on his own.</i>

26:59.667 --> 27:02.041
<i>And he wakes up at 5:00 a.m.</i>
<i>every morning</i>

27:02.076 --> 27:03.911
<i>and works in a restaurant</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>

27:06.014 --> 27:08.245
<i>Now, Blair is not</i>
<i>as self-sufficient.</i>

27:08.280 --> 27:10.214
<i>I mean, he lives in</i>
<i>a supervised group home</i>

27:10.249 --> 27:11.919
<i>with some of the other guys.</i>

27:11.954 --> 27:13.987
<i>And every morning,</i>
<i>he goes to a gardening workshop.</i>

27:14.022 --> 27:17.452
♪ I-I-I-I wanna run
the world, I-I-I-I... ♪

27:17.487 --> 27:20.752
-I mean, they all live
pretty full lives. -Hmm.

27:20.787 --> 27:23.799
<i> Now, some have</i>
<i>serious disabilities,</i>

27:23.834 --> 27:25.900
<i>and others, well, not so much.</i>

27:25.935 --> 27:27.660
<i>Sometimes it's genetic</i>

27:27.695 --> 27:29.970
<i>or something went sideways</i>
<i>during childbirth,</i>

27:30.005 --> 27:31.730
<i>an infection or--</i>

27:31.765 --> 27:33.171
<i>-We all have something, right?</i>

27:34.273 --> 27:36.570
Bye, Coach. Bye, Julio.

27:36.605 --> 27:38.473
Bye. You be good tonight.

27:38.508 --> 27:40.277
<i>Now, Johnny, uh,</i>

27:40.312 --> 27:41.817
<i>-works at an animal shelter.</i>

27:41.852 --> 27:44.215
<i>I mean, he loves animals,</i>
<i>all animals.</i>

27:46.120 --> 27:49.187
I guess that explains
that zoo-like aroma.

27:49.222 --> 27:52.421
Yeah. He also refuses to shower.

27:52.456 --> 27:54.357
-So there's that.
-Oh.

27:55.525 --> 27:57.932
Good evening, Coach.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.758
-Thank you so much
for everything. -Mm.

27:59.793 --> 28:02.002
<i>Buenas noches, señor Julio.</i>

28:02.037 --> 28:04.499
<i>Hasta pronto. Hasta mañana.</i>

28:04.534 --> 28:07.172
Arrivederci. Uh, sayonara.

28:07.207 --> 28:08.976
Does he actually speak Spanish?

28:09.011 --> 28:11.539
Yeah. He speaks four languages.

28:11.574 --> 28:13.475
-Oh. -

28:13.510 --> 28:18.117
Oh, dear. The 2:45 flight
from O'Hare to Portland is late.

28:18.152 --> 28:20.416
How the hell does he know that?
That-That's not normal.

28:22.893 --> 28:25.718
There must be
some chaos up there.

28:27.755 --> 28:30.063
Hey, Coach,
check out these handles.

28:35.532 --> 28:38.533
Ah. Now that's some
musical basketball right there.

28:38.568 --> 28:39.534
Rockin'.

28:39.569 --> 28:41.140
Be good.

28:41.175 --> 28:42.911
What's his story?

28:42.946 --> 28:45.474
Well, Craig,
he works in a vocational school.

28:45.509 --> 28:47.245
<i>He's a welder.</i>

28:47.280 --> 28:49.148
<i>He's such a good welder</i>
<i>that the new students</i>

28:49.183 --> 28:50.886
<i>just hang out</i>
<i>and watch him work.</i>

28:50.921 --> 28:53.581
<i>He calls them his groupies.</i>

28:55.189 --> 28:57.893
And Cody, he works
in the dye factory.

28:57.928 --> 29:00.159
<i>That's why he colors his hair.</i>

29:00.194 --> 29:02.029
<i>And he's in a band as well.</i>

29:12.206 --> 29:13.733
He's the guitarist.

29:13.768 --> 29:15.504
He says he gets all the chicks.

29:17.706 --> 29:20.740
♪ The world, the world,
the world, the world. ♪

29:22.447 --> 29:24.876
That's it. Lift it.

29:24.911 --> 29:26.680
Ooh. Hey, nice shots.

29:26.715 --> 29:28.418
Nice shots. That's it.

29:28.453 --> 29:31.322
Oh, I can feel it today, Red.

29:33.656 --> 29:36.932
Okay, guys, game day.

29:36.967 --> 29:40.694
Everybody, listen up.

29:40.729 --> 29:42.498
The first thing we want...

29:43.666 --> 29:45.369
Guys, I thought
I told you to wear blue.

29:45.404 --> 29:48.042
I look better in red.

29:48.077 --> 29:52.046
But it is a home game,
and home games, we wear blue.

29:52.081 --> 29:56.050
My girlfriend is here,
and she likes me in red.

29:56.085 --> 29:59.955
I'm sure your girlfriend would
like you just as much in blue.

29:59.990 --> 30:01.748
She'd say, "Oh, my God.

30:01.783 --> 30:04.058
Look how handsome
Craig looks in blue."

30:04.093 --> 30:06.786
She isn't that corny, man.

30:06.821 --> 30:08.293
She's into nasty stuff.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.526
Yeah, she is.

30:11.661 --> 30:13.001
O-Okay, have a seat.

30:13.036 --> 30:14.794
Guys, here's the deal.

30:14.829 --> 30:17.830
If you're not wearing blue,
you're not playing.

30:17.865 --> 30:19.733
I suffer from color blindness,

30:19.768 --> 30:21.735
so I don't really know
what I'm wearing.

30:21.770 --> 30:24.804
Well, luckily, Marlon, you're
wearing blue, so you're fine.

30:24.839 --> 30:26.905
Uh...

30:26.940 --> 30:28.940
Hold it. Where's Benny?

30:28.975 --> 30:31.349
He couldn't make it.
He had to work.

30:32.517 --> 30:35.122
<i>He had to work on game day?</i>

30:35.157 --> 30:38.356
Yeah, his boss is-is
a r-- is a r-- is a r-- a--

30:38.391 --> 30:39.753
a real asshole.

30:39.788 --> 30:42.426
Okay, no Benny.

30:42.461 --> 30:44.758
I guess we'll have to make do
with what we have.

30:50.667 --> 30:51.567
There we go. There we go!

30:55.672 --> 30:57.375
Beautiful! Look at that!

30:57.410 --> 30:58.838
Nice!

30:58.873 --> 31:00.576
Get back! Get back!

31:01.744 --> 31:02.809
Okay, right back down.
Right back down.

31:02.844 --> 31:04.019
Right back down, guys.

31:04.054 --> 31:05.119
-Right back down.
-Hustle! Hustle!

31:05.154 --> 31:06.219
Hustle, Red, hustle!

31:10.060 --> 31:13.622
-Nice! -You got to put
a hand up, Craig!

31:13.657 --> 31:16.889
All right, hands out, hands out.
Come on, defense.

31:16.924 --> 31:18.363
Let's get in there, defense!
Come on!

31:18.398 --> 31:19.925
Good pass. No, Showtime. No!

31:22.270 --> 31:23.236
All right. All right.

31:23.271 --> 31:24.501
Oh, yeah, go.

31:25.669 --> 31:27.933
There you go.
Hey, breakaway. All right.

31:30.003 --> 31:32.806
Hey! Look at that!

31:32.841 --> 31:34.841
Nice job, Jimmy. Great job.

31:34.876 --> 31:37.151
You can't let them outrun you
like that, Johnny.

31:37.186 --> 31:39.318
All right, cover your man.
Take a man.

31:39.353 --> 31:41.188
That's it. Hands, hands, hands.
You got it.

31:41.223 --> 31:41.683
Come on. Hands, guys!

31:41.718 --> 31:44.356
Hands! Hands!

31:44.391 --> 31:46.754
Come on. That's it.
Nice, nice, nice.

31:46.789 --> 31:47.986
Let's go, Johnny. Let's go.

31:48.021 --> 31:49.229
Shoot that! You got that!

31:50.397 --> 31:52.430
Yeah! That's great, buddy!

31:52.465 --> 31:54.267
Good job! Yes!

31:54.302 --> 31:56.027
All right, Jimmy,
this is yours. There you go.

31:56.062 --> 31:58.700
Hey! Look at that! Nice job!

31:58.735 --> 31:59.899
Get on back there!

31:59.934 --> 32:01.340
-Good work, Jimmy!

32:01.375 --> 32:02.902
Rotate.

32:02.937 --> 32:04.574
Come on, Red.

32:04.609 --> 32:05.542
Let's get in there.
Let's get in there.

32:05.577 --> 32:06.543
Defense, guys.

32:07.909 --> 32:09.843
-Get it, rebound.
-Terrible shot.

32:09.878 --> 32:12.417
Okay, okay. That's right. Okay.

32:18.590 --> 32:21.096
All right.

32:21.131 --> 32:22.658
Thanks for the ride.

32:25.091 --> 32:26.398
Marcus Marakovich?

32:27.830 --> 32:29.632
-Yep.
-Hi.

32:29.667 --> 32:31.403
I'm Zoe Baldeen. I write
for the<i> Des Moines Beacon.</i>

32:31.438 --> 32:32.800
I'm wondering
if I could talk to you

32:32.835 --> 32:34.109
about your new
coaching assignment.

32:34.144 --> 32:36.474
My new coaching assign--

32:36.509 --> 32:38.146
Th-This is the first
I'm hearing of this.

32:38.181 --> 32:39.708
Is it Philly?

32:39.743 --> 32:40.775
I'm talking about
your community service.

32:40.810 --> 32:43.151
Coaching The Friends.

32:44.946 --> 32:46.880
No, I... No comment.

32:46.915 --> 32:48.585
-This-this will only
take a moment. -Nope.

32:48.620 --> 32:50.422
Nope. Nope.

32:57.794 --> 33:01.169
Okay. Everybody, hold the balls.

33:01.204 --> 33:03.336
Hold the balls.

33:03.371 --> 33:06.240
Everybody, get over there.
Get over there.

33:06.275 --> 33:07.604
All right.

33:08.772 --> 33:11.641
Guys, today,
I am going to teach you

33:11.676 --> 33:14.182
the most beautiful play
in basketball.

33:14.217 --> 33:17.284
It's called the "pick-and-roll."

33:17.319 --> 33:21.156
I love this play.

33:21.191 --> 33:24.687
And when it is done right,
it gives me a hard-on.

33:24.722 --> 33:26.194
What the hell?

33:26.229 --> 33:28.493
Oh, sorry, Cody.
It-It's just the truth.

33:28.528 --> 33:30.297
Will it give me a hard-on?

33:30.332 --> 33:31.991
Well, if you're lucky, Marlon.

33:32.026 --> 33:35.599
Okay.
Now, Blair, you come defend me.

33:35.634 --> 33:37.337
Johnny, you're on my team.

33:37.372 --> 33:38.767
Benny, you're defending Johnny.

33:38.802 --> 33:40.934
Okay?

33:40.969 --> 33:43.101
Now, what happens is

33:43.136 --> 33:45.642
I start to come to the right,
toward you, Johnny.

33:45.677 --> 33:47.776
You step up
and set a pick on Blair.

33:47.811 --> 33:49.316
Where do I set it?

33:49.351 --> 33:51.384
You set it right here
at his elbow.

33:51.419 --> 33:53.353
Good. Good. Good.

33:53.388 --> 33:55.454
Oh. Oh.

33:55.489 --> 33:58.116
My God, you have
got to take a shower.

33:58.151 --> 33:59.854
Everyone says that.

33:59.889 --> 34:01.823
Yeah, and everyone's right.
I mean, I'm tearing.

34:01.858 --> 34:04.496
Okay, you setting the pick?

34:04.531 --> 34:06.498
Okay. Do you have a pick?

34:06.533 --> 34:08.203
No, you are the pick.

34:08.238 --> 34:10.634
Be-be like a statue.

34:10.669 --> 34:13.703
Good. And now I start
to come this way.

34:13.738 --> 34:15.573
They both have to come out,

34:15.608 --> 34:18.873
and that gives you
a chance to roll, Johnny.

34:18.908 --> 34:21.381
-Roll? -Yeah.
You-you move toward the basket.

34:21.416 --> 34:24.252
-Move toward the basket.
-But I'm a statue.

34:24.287 --> 34:27.519
-Statues don't move.
-Forget I said "statue."

34:29.259 --> 34:29.785
I can't.

34:32.790 --> 34:33.888
Okay.

34:35.023 --> 34:38.090
There you have it,
the pick-and-roll.

34:38.125 --> 34:40.499
Did it give you
a hard-on, Coach?

34:40.534 --> 34:44.239
No, Marlon. In fact,
I think my dick just evaporated.

34:44.274 --> 34:46.098
That sounds serious.

34:46.133 --> 34:48.606
Hmm. Yeah, it is.

34:54.317 --> 34:57.351
Hey, did you tell your boss
we got that road game in Ames?

34:57.386 --> 34:59.749
Yes, but I have a doubt.

34:59.784 --> 35:01.850
What doubt?

35:01.885 --> 35:03.918
I think he'll say yes,
but I have this doubt.

35:03.953 --> 35:07.856
-What doubt?
-This doubt.

35:07.891 --> 35:09.726
Okay. Okay. Fine.

35:09.761 --> 35:13.862
Uh, if you have any more doubts,
come talk to me, all right?

35:13.897 --> 35:16.436
Hey, Johnny. Jump in the shower.

35:16.471 --> 35:19.703
I don't believe in showers.

35:19.738 --> 35:21.804
-What does that mean?
-He's afraid of the water.

35:21.839 --> 35:23.102
There's a rat! It's a rat!

35:23.137 --> 35:24.444
A rat! A rat!

35:24.479 --> 35:26.875
A rat! A rat! A rat! A rat!

35:26.910 --> 35:28.745
There's a rat?
-Okay, relax.

35:28.780 --> 35:30.142
Okay, let's check it out.

35:30.177 --> 35:31.418
I didn't know we had a rat.

35:31.453 --> 35:32.815
Huh?
A rat.

35:32.850 --> 35:33.981
Since when did we have rats?

35:34.016 --> 35:34.982
I hope it's all right.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.723
Oh.

35:39.758 --> 35:41.725
That's not a rat.
-It's just a little mouse.

35:41.760 --> 35:42.957
Save it, Coach.

35:42.992 --> 35:44.629
It's gonna drown. Save it!

35:44.664 --> 35:46.224
All right, all right,
all right. Just relax.

35:46.259 --> 35:47.896
Take it easy. Take it easy.

35:47.931 --> 35:50.228
It's not gonna drown.
It's all right.

35:50.263 --> 35:51.669
Oh, no.

35:52.771 --> 35:55.508
We got to do something.

35:55.543 --> 35:57.642
-Where'd it go?!
-Down the drain.

35:57.677 --> 36:00.007
It gonna drown down there,
for real.

36:00.042 --> 36:01.976
During drowning,
your lungs fill with water,

36:02.011 --> 36:03.483
you can't get proper oxygen,
and then...

36:03.518 --> 36:05.419
Not now, Wikipedia.

36:05.454 --> 36:07.487
Save him, Coach. Save him!

36:07.522 --> 36:09.247
All right.

36:09.282 --> 36:11.051
Oh, no. He's...

36:12.153 --> 36:14.626
Oh, you know what, Johnny?

36:14.661 --> 36:16.364
You got to save him.

36:16.399 --> 36:19.158
You're the animal expert,
and he will sense that,

36:19.193 --> 36:21.259
and he will come to you.

36:21.294 --> 36:22.601
-You got to do it, Johnny.
-Come on. You got this.

36:22.636 --> 36:24.031
-Come on, Johnny.
-You got this. -Come on.

36:24.066 --> 36:25.769
That's it, Johnny.
-Come on, Johnny.

36:25.804 --> 36:27.705
You can do it, Johnny.
-Johnny, y-you get--

36:27.740 --> 36:29.839
No, no, Johnny, you got to,
you got to get in there,

36:29.874 --> 36:31.544
and you got to look down.

36:31.579 --> 36:34.107
You got to be able to look down,
so get under there.

36:34.142 --> 36:35.482
Can you see?

36:35.517 --> 36:37.143
Cutie, come out.

36:37.178 --> 36:39.453
Johnny, you know what? Here.

36:39.488 --> 36:40.685
You got to wash off.

36:40.720 --> 36:43.688
If you don't wash off,
the mouse can smell it,

36:43.723 --> 36:45.657
and you got to smell good.

36:45.692 --> 36:47.054
He'll smell that you're clean,
and then he'll come to you.

36:47.089 --> 36:49.188
Get under the pitters.
Under the pitters.

36:49.223 --> 36:51.861
That's good. Great.

36:51.896 --> 36:53.962
Take a run
at that undercarriage.

36:53.997 --> 36:56.063
There you go. Yeah.

36:56.098 --> 36:58.131
But don't overdo it.

36:58.166 --> 36:59.132
All right. That's good.

36:59.167 --> 37:01.739
Yeah. Great, Johnny.

37:01.774 --> 37:04.412
-Cutie, I'm clean. Come out.

37:04.447 --> 37:06.205
There it is.
There he is!

37:06.240 --> 37:08.306
-Look! He's going, guys!
-We saved him.

37:08.341 --> 37:09.879
There he goes!
Way to go, Johnny.

37:09.914 --> 37:11.914
You freakin' saved him!
You saved him!

37:11.949 --> 37:13.883
-He's free!
-You freed the mouse!

37:13.918 --> 37:15.918
-How's that feel?
-It feels pretty good.

37:15.953 --> 37:17.348
Yeah?

37:17.383 --> 37:18.822
Give me a hug, Coach.

37:18.857 --> 37:21.594
I already had...

37:21.629 --> 37:24.256
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on. Come on.

37:24.291 --> 37:25.598
Yeah.

37:25.633 --> 37:27.259
Yay!

37:27.294 --> 37:30.097
Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!

37:30.132 --> 37:35.300
Johnny! Johnny!
Johnny! Johnny!

37:36.446 --> 37:38.545
Well, first road game, huh?

37:38.580 --> 37:40.415
-This is exciting.
-Yeah.

37:40.450 --> 37:42.076
Look, the bus stop
is right over there.

37:42.111 --> 37:44.848
Takes you right into
the heart of Ames.

37:44.883 --> 37:47.686
Hold on. We-- Public bus?

37:47.721 --> 37:49.622
What are you expecting, a limo?

37:50.889 --> 37:53.252
-Are you coming with me?
-No.

37:53.287 --> 37:56.464
I can't look after these guys
all by myself.

37:56.499 --> 38:00.435
Marcus, relax.
You'll be just fine.

38:00.470 --> 38:03.570
Oh. Oh. Good news.
I forgot something.

38:03.605 --> 38:06.364
You're getting a player off the
injured list to replace Darius.

38:06.399 --> 38:08.069
Cosentino.

38:08.104 --> 38:10.874
Hell of a ballplayer, Cosentino.

38:10.909 --> 38:12.843
All right. Happy luck.

38:23.416 --> 38:25.658
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:27.156 --> 38:28.991
So, Johnny.

38:29.026 --> 38:31.158
Look at you,
all fresh and clean.

38:31.193 --> 38:34.062
I put baby powder
on my armpits and feet.

38:34.097 --> 38:35.899
Great.

38:35.934 --> 38:38.473
Okay. Uh...

38:38.508 --> 38:40.640
Hold it. Where's Benny?

38:40.675 --> 38:42.675
He had to work. He texted me.

38:42.710 --> 38:44.105
Again?

38:44.140 --> 38:45.337
Yep.

38:47.308 --> 38:50.177
Okay, so I guess we're
just waiting on this Cosentino.

38:50.212 --> 38:51.816
Cosentino had
a Grade 2 ankle sprain.

38:51.851 --> 38:53.345
Just came back off
from the injured reserve

38:53.380 --> 38:54.588

38:54.623 --> 38:56.920
Kicking ass. I like that.

38:56.955 --> 38:58.757
No, literally,
kicked some guy in the ass.

38:58.792 --> 39:00.451

39:00.486 --> 39:02.321

41:24.773 --> 41:27.675
Did you hear?
Johnny's gonna move in with us.

41:27.710 --> 41:30.568
Yeah, I heard something
about that, Blair.

41:30.603 --> 41:32.911
I'll get his attention.

41:32.946 --> 41:34.781
Oh. Oh, no, no!

41:34.816 --> 41:37.817
Ah! Projectile!

41:37.852 --> 41:39.016
Oh, no.

41:39.051 --> 41:40.820
Whoa!

41:40.855 --> 41:43.251
That was not
your smoothest stop.

41:43.286 --> 41:45.253
Who is in charge of these guys?!

41:45.288 --> 41:48.025
Oh, that'd be me.
Uh, I'm their coach.

41:48.060 --> 41:49.422
If you're trying to
get us all nauseous, good job.

41:49.457 --> 41:50.962
They are being disruptive.

41:50.997 --> 41:52.524
I got hit in the head
with something.

41:52.559 --> 41:53.327
I got one guy
talking my ear off.

41:53.362 --> 41:55.967
I got Adele over there

41:56.002 --> 41:57.672
just singing
at the top of his lungs.

41:57.707 --> 41:58.332
Look, I don't see
any signs around here

41:58.367 --> 42:00.598
that says "no singing."

42:00.633 --> 42:03.040
They can't be throwing things.

42:03.075 --> 42:05.306
Okay, look, we're just trying
to get to a basketball game.

42:05.341 --> 42:07.781
Fine.

42:07.816 --> 42:09.277
Lower the volume on the singing.

42:09.312 --> 42:11.719
Yeah, no, I... I'll talk to him.

42:11.754 --> 42:13.017
Yeah.

That is not happening.

42:38.077 --> 42:40.044
Maybe we could hitchhike.

42:40.079 --> 42:41.848
Well, we'd have to
flag down an RV.

43:14.916 --> 43:16.410
Ah, what do you say, guys?

43:16.445 --> 43:17.884
Better than the bus, right?

43:17.919 --> 43:19.754
Yeah.
That bus smelled like puke.

43:22.550 --> 43:27.289
Hey, uh, thank you
for picking us up.

43:27.324 --> 43:28.719
Don't thank me.
Thank my brother.

43:28.754 --> 43:30.457
I'm doing it for him.

43:30.492 --> 43:32.932
He seems to think
you're a really terrific guy.

43:32.967 --> 43:35.330
Doesn't exactly track
for me, but...

43:38.170 --> 43:41.567
Well, I think
he's a terrific guy.

43:41.602 --> 43:44.141
I do hear you got him
to take a shower.

43:44.176 --> 43:46.814
That's very much appreciated.

43:46.849 --> 43:48.442
Wh-What's going on with that?

43:48.477 --> 43:50.950
I never heard of anyone
afraid of a shower.

43:50.985 --> 43:54.481
He's afraid of water. He...

43:54.516 --> 43:56.890
He almost drowned in a
swimming pool when we were kids.

43:56.925 --> 43:59.321
It was... Long story.

43:59.356 --> 44:00.894
Oh. Oh.

44:00.929 --> 44:02.863
Oh, is that how he, uh, got...

44:04.493 --> 44:07.197

44:08.266 --> 44:10.662

44:10.697 --> 44:12.433
No, you don't catch it
from water.

44:12.468 --> 44:13.973
-It's genetic.
-Sorry. I...

44:14.008 --> 44:16.239

got kicked off the bus.

44:24.645 --> 44:26.821
Yeah, but Coach stuck up for us.

44:26.856 --> 44:29.516
Mm-hmm.
-Really?

44:29.551 --> 44:31.452
The driver was
an asshole, right?

44:31.487 --> 44:32.618
Big-time.

44:32.653 --> 44:34.488
Oh, he was one of your people.

44:34.523 --> 44:36.325

you guys couldn't have

44:36.360 --> 44:37.964
worked something out.

44:37.999 --> 44:39.493
No, we did work something out.

44:39.528 --> 44:41.429
We worked ourselves
right out of the bus

44:41.464 --> 44:43.794
and into a field
in the middle of Iowa.

44:43.829 --> 44:46.203

the bus is a good option.

47:24.231 --> 47:25.758
Agreed.

47:25.793 --> 47:27.661
What if we just play
the home games?

47:27.696 --> 47:30.004
If we don't play the away games,
it's a forfeit,

47:30.039 --> 47:31.665
and a forfeit
is considered a loss.

47:31.700 --> 47:33.271
That's half our season.

47:33.306 --> 47:35.471
We won't qualify for
North American regionals.

rolling like pimps.

47:46.154 --> 47:51.223

How do you know that?

47:52.754 --> 47:54.193

No forfeits.

48:00.366 --> 48:01.992
Yeah, okay, okay. Take it easy.

48:02.027 --> 48:04.566
No, we haven't
forfeited anything.

48:04.601 --> 48:06.139
Hey.
Why don't you just rent a van?

48:06.174 --> 48:10.209

Yep. Careful, buddy.

-Okay.
-Okay.

49:21.678 --> 49:22.809
-Bye, Coach.
-Ah.

49:22.844 --> 49:24.283
-Great game. Great game.
-Hey.

49:24.318 --> 49:25.977
-Great job today.
-Okay. -Oh, yeah.

49:26.012 --> 49:27.880
-Way to go.
-Yeah. -All right.

49:27.915 --> 49:30.322
-Good night. Sweet dreams.
-You, too. Love you.

49:36.022 --> 49:38.330
Hey, uh...

49:38.365 --> 49:41.432
Are you gonna murder me
right now?

49:41.467 --> 49:43.060
Let me break this down
for you, Coach.

49:43.095 --> 49:44.666
I'm a woman in my 40s.

49:44.701 --> 49:46.635
I don't have time for bullshit,
all right?

49:46.670 --> 49:48.241
Do you know what I do
during the weekday?

49:48.276 --> 49:49.737
-No.
-I perform Shakespeare

49:49.772 --> 49:52.069
for middle school kids
right after lunch.

49:52.104 --> 49:53.840
Um, do you know
what middle school kids

49:53.875 --> 49:55.512
want to be doing
right after lunch?

49:55.547 --> 49:56.909
No.

49:56.944 --> 49:58.746
It ain't Shakespeare.

49:58.781 --> 49:59.846
It's exhausting, but
it's acting, and I love acting.

49:59.881 --> 50:02.915
So, after that,
I go home and I do

50:02.950 --> 50:05.357
a lot of freelance bookkeeping
because Shakespeare--

50:05.392 --> 50:06.853
and brace yourself here,
this might blow your mind--

50:06.888 --> 50:10.758
-doesn't pay so much.

50:10.793 --> 50:12.199
And then I go pick up
Johnny from work,

50:12.234 --> 50:13.761
and we spend
the whole afternoon together.

50:13.796 --> 50:15.994
And I love him very much,
but it's exhausting.

50:16.029 --> 50:17.666
And then I make dinner
with my mom,

50:17.701 --> 50:19.701
and then I watch<i> Doctor Who</i>
with Johnny,

50:19.736 --> 50:22.473
and if I have any energy left
at the end of the night,

50:22.508 --> 50:24.640
sometimes I hop on Tinder, okay?

50:24.675 --> 50:25.938
'Cause a woman's got needs.

50:25.973 --> 50:29.183
Oh, yeah. Well, no doubt.

50:29.218 --> 50:31.680
And you might be
a big, giant pain in my ass,

50:31.715 --> 50:35.112
but as far as I remember,
you were...

50:35.147 --> 50:37.147
passable in bed.

50:37.182 --> 50:40.656
Uh, uh, passable,
like passing the bar

50:40.691 --> 50:42.559
or passing a kidney stone?

50:42.594 --> 50:44.330
You got the job done.

50:44.365 --> 50:46.233
It-- You were fine, right?

50:46.268 --> 50:49.159
And sometimes, that's all
a woman can ask for, okay?

50:49.194 --> 50:51.370
Mm. Mm. Mm.

50:51.405 --> 50:53.372
You are singing my praises.

50:53.407 --> 50:56.507
So the bottom line is:
Are we doing this or what?

50:56.542 --> 50:58.806
Consider me swiped off my feet.

50:58.841 --> 51:00.742
Great. Buckle up.

51:14.692 --> 51:17.330
All right, now,
listen up, Showtime.

51:17.365 --> 51:19.860
You see how my shoulders
are facing the basket,

51:19.895 --> 51:22.896
-my sternum facing the basket.
-Yeah.

51:22.931 --> 51:26.900
Yeah?
Squared up, and then I shoot.

51:26.935 --> 51:28.275
-I'll try it.
-You'll do it?

51:28.310 --> 51:29.771
-Yeah.
-Come on.

51:31.709 --> 51:33.841
-Okay, already
you're doing great. -

51:33.876 --> 51:36.206
You're facing the basket.
That's good. Now--

51:36.241 --> 51:38.219
-Oh, hey, Darius.
-Nope.

51:43.556 --> 51:45.556
Big balls.

51:48.055 --> 51:49.725
Big balls, huh?

51:51.124 --> 51:53.630
Friends, let's go. Go.

51:53.665 --> 51:55.599
Yeah. Nice, Craig.
Fire it up, Craig.

51:55.634 --> 51:57.898
Craig.

51:57.933 --> 51:59.570
Yeah, yeah. Fire it up.
Yes! Yes!

52:01.673 --> 52:03.068
-Yeah!

52:03.103 --> 52:05.774
Yeah! Nice, Cody!

52:07.811 --> 52:08.975
Not bad.

52:11.782 --> 52:13.419
Pick-and-roll, Johnny.

52:13.454 --> 52:14.717
Good. Set the screen.

52:14.752 --> 52:15.982
Good.

52:16.017 --> 52:17.423
Now roll! Roll!

52:18.426 --> 52:20.294
Roll!

52:21.495 --> 52:23.660
What are you doing?
You're supposed to roll.

52:23.695 --> 52:26.630
I'm a statue.
Statues don't move.

52:28.370 --> 52:29.798
Right.

52:32.605 --> 52:35.672
<i> Then the dead queen's</i>
<i>best friend</i>

52:35.707 --> 52:38.939
shows the king
a statue of Hermione,

52:38.974 --> 52:42.778
and she says,
"'Tis time. Descend.

52:42.813 --> 52:44.681
Be stone no more."

52:44.716 --> 52:46.914
And that statue comes to life.

52:46.949 --> 52:48.949
-Really?
-Yes!

52:48.984 --> 52:50.489
And she starts moving,

52:50.524 --> 52:53.217
and then she steps down
from her pedestal.

52:57.696 --> 52:59.630
Yeah, Craig, bring it down.

52:59.665 --> 53:02.930
Pick-and-roll, Johnny. Statue!

53:02.965 --> 53:04.536
Okay, now roll, Johnny!

53:04.571 --> 53:06.439
Roll!

53:06.474 --> 53:09.167
'Tis time! Descend!
Be stone no more, Hermione!

53:09.202 --> 53:11.840
Roll, Hermione! Roll!

53:15.681 --> 53:17.846
-Yeah! That's it.

53:17.881 --> 53:19.144
-Yes!

53:19.179 --> 53:21.113
-Yeah!
Beautiful!

53:21.148 --> 53:22.818
You see that?!

53:22.853 --> 53:25.491
Now, that's
the pick-and-roll, baby.

53:25.526 --> 53:27.658
Did it give you
an erection, Coach?

53:27.693 --> 53:29.220
I'm rock hard, Marlon.

53:29.255 --> 53:31.156
Good.

53:31.191 --> 53:32.399
I'll explain that later.

53:32.434 --> 53:33.994
Uh, defense! Defense!

53:34.029 --> 53:34.929
I can't wait.

53:44.545 --> 53:45.709
Yeah, that's it.

53:53.686 --> 53:55.114
Yeah!

54:01.254 --> 54:02.858
What?

54:02.893 --> 54:04.662
Are you time-outing me?

54:04.697 --> 54:06.323
Can I ask you a question?

54:06.358 --> 54:07.698
Right now?

54:07.733 --> 54:09.326
-Yes. Um...
-Oh.

54:09.361 --> 54:11.735
I just...

54:11.770 --> 54:14.001
I was wondering, you and I...

54:14.036 --> 54:15.706
Oh, God.

54:15.741 --> 54:17.235
-No, wait.
-What are you doing?

54:17.270 --> 54:18.445
Don't make it hard.
I just want to ask you...

54:18.480 --> 54:19.743
Oh. This is so cute.

54:19.778 --> 54:21.239
What do you want to know
about us?

54:21.274 --> 54:24.044
Where-Where-Where's
this relationship going?

54:24.079 --> 54:26.420
Hey, hey. It-It's just sex.

54:26.455 --> 54:28.015
It's okay.
Just sex after away games.

54:28.050 --> 54:29.588
Very convenient.

54:30.822 --> 54:32.888
You good with that?

54:32.923 --> 54:34.857
Yeah.
I mean, you're not planning on

54:34.892 --> 54:37.387
sticking around Des Moines
after your 90 days, are you?

54:37.422 --> 54:38.927
-No.
-No.

54:38.962 --> 54:41.193
Well, then,
it's a win-win, isn't it?

54:41.228 --> 54:43.030
Are you okay with that?

54:43.065 --> 54:45.296
Yeah, no, I can, I can
learn to live with it, yeah.

54:45.331 --> 54:46.902
Okay. All right.

54:46.937 --> 54:49.938
Well, then, can we... game on?

54:49.973 --> 54:51.335
Definitely.

55:00.984 --> 55:03.215
What am I looking at here?

55:03.250 --> 55:04.755
Oh, pipes burst.

55:04.790 --> 55:06.922
I don't know.

55:06.957 --> 55:08.495
It must be global warming, huh?

55:08.530 --> 55:10.992
I mean, it's raining,
and it's freezing,

55:11.027 --> 55:12.763
and it's snowing,
then it's freezing again.

55:12.798 --> 55:15.161
And all of a sudden,
it's hot girl summer in January.

55:16.868 --> 55:18.472
I tried to call everybody
to warn them,

55:18.507 --> 55:20.672
but these guys
showed up anyways.

55:20.707 --> 55:22.234
Look, you've been
running them pretty good.

55:22.269 --> 55:23.906
Just take the day off,
and I'll get this fixed.

55:23.941 --> 55:25.743
No, no.

55:25.778 --> 55:28.339
No days off. I know the spot.

55:28.374 --> 55:30.946
Guys. Follow me.

55:30.981 --> 55:32.981
Hey. I'm open. I'm open.

55:34.017 --> 55:35.247
Shoot it.

55:35.282 --> 55:37.788
Here, here.

55:39.561 --> 55:41.418
Way to go.
Come on, come on.

55:41.453 --> 55:44.025
All right,
we're gonna practice here today.

55:44.060 --> 55:45.499
This'll be good.

55:45.534 --> 55:47.600
Benny never gets
to play in a game.

55:47.635 --> 55:48.832
Because of his asshole boss.

55:48.867 --> 55:51.131
Because of
his asshole boss, exactly.

55:51.166 --> 55:53.936
But today...

55:53.971 --> 55:55.432
Benny plays.

55:55.467 --> 55:57.973
And guess what.
I'm playing with you.

55:58.008 --> 55:59.469
Yes!

55:59.504 --> 56:01.845
But are we invited
to play in the game?

56:01.880 --> 56:03.649
No invitation necessary.

56:03.684 --> 56:05.145
There's nobody waiting.

56:05.180 --> 56:06.520
You just say, "We got next."

56:06.555 --> 56:09.149
That means you're playing
the next game.

56:09.184 --> 56:10.381
Shoot, shoot.

56:10.416 --> 56:12.152
-Good one, guys.

56:12.187 --> 56:13.483
Okay.

56:13.518 --> 56:15.452
Benny, do the honors.
Say it loud.

56:15.487 --> 56:17.025
We got next!

56:17.060 --> 56:17.092
Nice.

56:18.325 --> 56:20.831
-See you later.
-Let's run it back.

56:20.866 --> 56:21.997
-Have a good one.
-Take it easy.

56:25.200 --> 56:26.573
Hey.

56:26.608 --> 56:28.674
Did you hear my man?
We got next.

56:28.709 --> 56:30.742
Yeah, but we're running it back.

56:30.777 --> 56:33.646
What is this,
some kind of Jedi mind trick?

56:33.681 --> 56:35.813
You lost. We got next.

56:35.848 --> 56:38.244
That's how it goes.

56:38.279 --> 56:39.586
Come on, man.

56:39.621 --> 56:41.247
Come on what?

56:41.282 --> 56:42.820
You know.

56:42.855 --> 56:44.349
No, I don't know.

56:44.384 --> 56:45.856
Don't make me say it.

56:45.891 --> 56:47.385
Make you say what?

56:49.290 --> 56:51.191
They're retards.

56:51.226 --> 56:53.424

56:55.230 --> 56:56.702
All right, let's go, fellas.

56:56.737 --> 56:58.033
We got next!

56:58.068 --> 56:59.936
Yeah.

57:05.306 --> 57:07.339

1:00:51.972 --> 1:00:53.631
I'll take him down.

1:00:53.666 --> 1:00:57.173
And if I cannot,
I'll find those that shall.

1:00:57.208 --> 1:00:59.142
Scurvy knave.

1:00:59.177 --> 1:01:01.177
I am none of his flirtgills.

1:01:01.212 --> 1:01:04.279
I am none of his skainsmates.

1:01:04.314 --> 1:01:05.918
And now afore God,

1:01:05.953 --> 1:01:08.514
I am so vexed that every part
about me quivers.

1:01:08.549 --> 1:01:11.517
-Scurvy knave.

1:01:39.580 --> 1:01:41.855
You caught me.

1:01:41.890 --> 1:01:43.890
I try to keep that hidden
in there,

1:01:43.925 --> 1:01:47.652
but it's Shakespeare
for... dummies.

1:01:47.687 --> 1:01:49.896
-A second book?

1:01:49.931 --> 1:01:53.460
I mean,
I don't even know what to say.

1:01:53.495 --> 1:01:56.727
I just never would have
visualized that.

1:01:58.566 --> 1:02:00.071
So you're into Shakespeare, huh?

1:02:01.239 --> 1:02:05.912
I art interested
in certain personages

1:02:05.947 --> 1:02:09.344
who art interested
in Shakespeare.

1:02:09.379 --> 1:02:10.510
Art thou, now?

1:02:10.545 --> 1:02:15.020

There he is.

1:02:36.802 --> 1:02:37.471
What's good, Marcus?

1:02:40.377 --> 1:02:41.915
Well...

1:02:41.950 --> 1:02:43.345
I'll tell you what's not good.

1:02:43.380 --> 1:02:47.349
I, uh, decided to contact
your uncle's office directly.

1:02:47.384 --> 1:02:50.957
Turns out he's not
a big fan of mine.

1:02:50.992 --> 1:02:52.783
Is he?

1:02:53.819 --> 1:02:55.753
Is he?

1:02:57.889 --> 1:02:58.558
No.

1:02:58.593 --> 1:03:02.034
No, he is not.

1:03:02.069 --> 1:03:03.893
I wanted to help.

1:03:03.928 --> 1:03:07.303
I tried, really, but he
shut me down, like, instantly.

1:03:07.338 --> 1:03:08.942
Instantly. Instantly.

1:03:08.977 --> 1:03:11.241
So this
whole thing about Phoenix

1:03:11.276 --> 1:03:12.979
was just bullshit.

1:03:14.983 --> 1:03:16.246
Yeah.

1:03:16.281 --> 1:03:18.578
What the hell, man?

1:03:18.613 --> 1:03:20.987
This is my life
you're toying with.

1:03:21.022 --> 1:03:23.088
That was my last shot.

1:03:23.123 --> 1:03:24.287
Why would you do that?

1:03:26.918 --> 1:03:28.423
I-I wanted to be friends.

1:03:28.458 --> 1:03:30.623
Oh. Oh, yeah, right, right.

1:03:30.658 --> 1:03:34.891
You wanted me to mentor your
coaching career, or whatever.

1:03:34.926 --> 1:03:36.233
You were using me.

1:03:36.268 --> 1:03:38.235
You made it pretty clear

1:03:38.270 --> 1:03:41.271
you were only hanging out with
me because of my uncle, so...

1:03:41.306 --> 1:03:42.536
if anyone was using anyone...

1:03:48.016 --> 1:03:49.609
I'll see you around, Marcus.

1:03:49.644 --> 1:03:52.986
Hey.

1:03:53.021 --> 1:03:55.989
Why would you want to be
friends with me, anyway?

1:03:57.982 --> 1:03:59.784
I don't know, man.

1:03:59.819 --> 1:04:02.523
It seemed like
you could use one.

1:04:13.965 --> 1:04:15.800
Good practice today, Coach.

1:04:15.835 --> 1:04:17.274
I picked and I rolled.

1:04:17.309 --> 1:04:18.308
Pick-and-roll.

1:04:18.343 --> 1:04:21.047
Yeah.
Pick-and-roll, pick-and-roll.

1:04:22.215 --> 1:04:24.380
You're a ball of sunshine today.

1:04:24.415 --> 1:04:29.022
Well, I got
some not-so-wonderful news today

1:04:29.057 --> 1:04:30.749
about, uh, Phoenix.

1:04:31.752 --> 1:04:33.356
Oh.

1:04:33.391 --> 1:04:34.654
You know what always
cheers me up, Coach?

1:04:34.689 --> 1:04:37.888
Meat loaf.

1:04:37.923 --> 1:04:39.956
You should come over for dinner.

1:04:39.991 --> 1:04:43.333
Uh... no. I-I can't do it
tonight, Johnny. Thank you.

1:04:43.368 --> 1:04:44.796
Not tonight.

1:04:44.831 --> 1:04:48.569
Monday. Meat loaf Monday.

1:04:48.604 --> 1:04:50.901
You got to come. It's the best.

1:04:50.936 --> 1:04:54.476
Uh, I-I don't... I...
No, I don't... No.

1:04:54.511 --> 1:04:56.214
Come. You can meet our mom.

1:04:56.249 --> 1:04:57.380
No, you know, you know what?

1:04:57.415 --> 1:04:59.382
He might have, like, a...

1:04:59.417 --> 1:05:02.187
Macaroni Monday plan
or something

1:05:02.222 --> 1:05:03.914
and, you know, you don't
want to mess with that, right?

1:05:03.949 --> 1:05:05.190
No.

1:05:06.523 --> 1:05:08.358
You know what?

1:05:08.393 --> 1:05:12.527
I think I will take you up
on that very kind offer, Johnny.

1:05:12.562 --> 1:05:13.759
Absolutely.

1:05:13.794 --> 1:05:16.333
Yes!

1:05:16.368 --> 1:05:17.862
Are you sure?

1:05:17.897 --> 1:05:20.106
No, no. I'm positive. I-I...

1:05:20.141 --> 1:05:23.175
I can't think of anything
better to do on Monday.

1:05:39.556 --> 1:05:41.424
Psst!

1:05:43.560 --> 1:05:45.131
What are you doing?

1:05:45.166 --> 1:05:46.561
What's it look like I'm doing?

1:05:46.596 --> 1:05:47.892
I'm hiding.

1:05:47.927 --> 1:05:49.960
Why?

1:05:51.172 --> 1:05:52.600
They fired me, remember?

1:05:52.635 --> 1:05:54.965
Oh, yeah. They did.

1:05:56.001 --> 1:05:57.275
What's going on?

1:05:57.310 --> 1:05:58.969
Well, I was just wondering,

1:05:59.004 --> 1:06:02.247
are they still underutilizing
your talents here?

1:06:02.282 --> 1:06:05.074
I'm still catching farts,
if that answers your question.

1:06:05.109 --> 1:06:07.780
Well, um...

1:06:07.815 --> 1:06:09.980
do you have any time
on Tuesdays and Thursday?

1:06:10.015 --> 1:06:11.487
Yeah.

1:06:11.522 --> 1:06:13.082
Sometimes.

1:06:13.117 --> 1:06:15.084
I could use an assistant.

1:06:15.119 --> 1:06:18.054
With The Friends? Really?

1:06:18.089 --> 1:06:21.926
Yeah, you know, uh, you know,
I run these, uh...

1:06:21.961 --> 1:06:23.730
different exercises with them,

1:06:23.765 --> 1:06:26.436
and, uh, when I split them
into two groups,

1:06:26.471 --> 1:06:28.801
it just goes off
the rails, so...

1:06:28.836 --> 1:06:31.507
I-I could use some help.

1:06:31.542 --> 1:06:35.280
And, I mean, it's not glamorous,
but it's basketball,

1:06:35.315 --> 1:06:39.075
and, uh, I don't know, uh...

1:06:39.110 --> 1:06:41.187
sometimes we could look at film.

1:06:41.222 --> 1:06:42.980
What do you say?

1:06:43.015 --> 1:06:44.916
Uh...

1:06:44.951 --> 1:06:46.522
hell to the yeah?

1:06:47.888 --> 1:06:49.085
Uh, so, wait,
is this a friendship

1:06:49.120 --> 1:06:50.526
or mentorship type thing?

1:06:50.561 --> 1:06:52.528
Are we talking profesh or soche?

1:06:52.563 --> 1:06:54.200
Or... both?

1:06:54.235 --> 1:06:57.126
It-It's early days,
so let's not label it yet.

1:06:57.161 --> 1:06:58.369
-Cool, cool, cool. Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:06:58.404 --> 1:06:59.667
I-I'm free tonight.

1:06:59.702 --> 1:07:01.471
No, no,
I have something tonight,

1:07:01.506 --> 1:07:03.033
but I will text you.

1:07:03.068 --> 1:07:05.035
Um...

1:07:05.070 --> 1:07:06.641
I gots to go.

1:07:16.015 --> 1:07:17.784
Oh, my God.

1:07:24.892 --> 1:07:26.496
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:07:26.531 --> 1:07:28.531
I'm, uh, Marcus,
the basketball coach.

1:07:28.566 --> 1:07:30.566
I'm Dot, the mother. Come on in.

1:07:34.506 --> 1:07:37.342
Well, this is the castle.

1:07:37.377 --> 1:07:39.311
-Very nice. -Those two should
be back in a minute.

1:07:39.346 --> 1:07:41.478
Okay. Uh, this is for you.

1:07:41.513 --> 1:07:44.217
Oh. How kind.
Thank you. Take a seat.

1:07:44.252 --> 1:07:46.747
-I'll be right back.
-All right.

1:07:48.047 --> 1:07:50.113
-Oh.

1:07:51.952 --> 1:07:55.492
Uh, I nearly squashed
your, uh, hamster.

1:07:55.527 --> 1:07:56.691
Oh, that's just Honeybun.

1:07:56.726 --> 1:07:58.154
He'll be fine.

1:07:58.189 --> 1:07:59.331
Oh. Okay.

1:07:59.366 --> 1:08:01.828
So you've been a busy man.

1:08:01.863 --> 1:08:03.192
What do you mean?

1:08:03.227 --> 1:08:06.668
Well, you're coaching Johnny,
and...

1:08:06.703 --> 1:08:09.308
you and Alex, you know.

1:08:10.377 --> 1:08:12.410
No, I don't know.

1:08:13.479 --> 1:08:14.841
You don't know?

1:08:14.876 --> 1:08:16.073
No, I don't, I don't know. I...

1:08:16.108 --> 1:08:18.515
Well, you know what you know.

1:08:18.550 --> 1:08:22.288
Well, I-I know that I don't know
what you think you know.

1:08:22.323 --> 1:08:25.049
Uh, yeah, I mean,
I-I do know I'm...

1:08:25.084 --> 1:08:27.887
I'm just here for dinner.

1:08:27.922 --> 1:08:29.295
-Yeah, right.

1:08:29.330 --> 1:08:30.692
ALEX and JOHNNY:

1:08:30.727 --> 1:08:32.056

1:08:37.096 --> 1:08:38.931
Oh, hey, Johnny. Yeah.

1:08:40.341 --> 1:08:41.934
Peaches. God, sorry.
-Oh.

1:08:41.969 --> 1:08:43.034
Oh, knock it off, Peaches.
Stop. God.

1:08:43.069 --> 1:08:44.068
Peaches, down.

1:08:44.103 --> 1:08:45.102
Oh, friendly. Yeah.

1:08:45.137 --> 1:08:46.312
Yeah, sorry.

1:08:46.347 --> 1:08:48.578
We've got kind of a zoo here.

1:08:48.613 --> 1:08:50.107
Yeah.
Yeah, I think I just squashed

1:08:50.142 --> 1:08:52.549
your gerbil, maybe, almost.

1:08:52.584 --> 1:08:54.980
All these cuties show up
from my work.

1:08:55.015 --> 1:08:56.212
I rescued them.

1:08:56.247 --> 1:08:57.389
Oh.

1:08:57.424 --> 1:08:59.149
Can you rescue me?

1:08:59.184 --> 1:09:00.491
-Kinda tickles. -Oh, Peaches,
off, off, off, off, off.

1:09:00.526 --> 1:09:01.624
Peaches, down.
Get off.

1:09:01.659 --> 1:09:03.659
-I'm so... so sorry.
-No.

1:09:03.694 --> 1:09:07.960
I'll rescue whoever is gonna be
put down in the shelter.

1:09:07.995 --> 1:09:09.830
Since I started working,

1:09:09.865 --> 1:09:12.833
they haven't put down
a single animal.

1:09:12.868 --> 1:09:15.165
Really? That's great.

1:09:15.200 --> 1:09:16.573
Not a single one.

1:09:16.608 --> 1:09:18.509
Not a single one.

1:09:19.545 --> 1:09:21.578
Oh, my God.

1:09:21.613 --> 1:09:23.107
Incredible.

1:09:23.142 --> 1:09:24.944
Thank you so much.

1:09:24.979 --> 1:09:28.915
I-I haven't had
a home-cooked meal in... I...

1:09:28.950 --> 1:09:30.488
Oh, geez, I don't even remember.

1:09:32.393 --> 1:09:35.119
Cheesy meat loaf
is my favorite, too, Coach.

1:09:35.154 --> 1:09:37.924
It's good.
Not healthy, but it's good.

1:09:37.959 --> 1:09:41.092
Yeah. I'm supposed to be
on a low-cholesterol diet,

1:09:41.127 --> 1:09:44.194
-but, what, am I gonna
live forever? -Right.

1:09:44.229 --> 1:09:45.833
-I don't think so.
-Well, you got me there.

1:09:45.868 --> 1:09:47.505
You're not the food Nazi,
are you?

1:09:47.540 --> 1:09:49.969
Not... No, not me.
Not on cheesy meat loaf night.

1:09:53.172 --> 1:09:57.009
So, uh, Johnny's gonna move into
the group home with the fellas.

1:09:57.044 --> 1:09:59.682
That's gonna be fun, huh?

1:10:00.883 --> 1:10:02.113
That's what I've been saying.

1:10:02.148 --> 1:10:05.688
N-No, he's not.
Where'd you hear that?

1:10:06.856 --> 1:10:08.955
Well, well, from Johnny

1:10:08.990 --> 1:10:12.057
and-and Cody and Craig
and-and Blair.

1:10:12.092 --> 1:10:13.630
They're all excited.

1:10:13.665 --> 1:10:15.192
No, no. He doesn't
have to move into a home.

1:10:15.227 --> 1:10:16.996
He's got everything
he needs right here.

1:10:17.031 --> 1:10:18.129
Plus, we have so much fun,
right, bud?

1:10:18.164 --> 1:10:19.471
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:10:19.506 --> 1:10:21.330
But, Johnny, you told me...

1:10:21.365 --> 1:10:23.002
This doesn't involve you.

1:10:32.618 --> 1:10:34.354
You know what?

1:10:36.182 --> 1:10:37.720
I got a big day tomorrow.

1:10:37.755 --> 1:10:41.020
I better get on the road.

1:10:41.055 --> 1:10:42.824
Uh, thank you so much
for everything.

1:10:42.859 --> 1:10:44.529
This has been fabulous.

1:10:44.564 --> 1:10:46.355
You're welcome.

1:10:46.390 --> 1:10:50.568
And there you go,
driving another boyfriend away.

1:10:50.603 --> 1:10:53.835
-He's not my boyfriend.
-He came to dinner.

1:10:53.870 --> 1:10:55.936
First man you've invited
home in years...

1:10:55.971 --> 1:10:57.773
-Johnny invited him.
-Johnny invited him.

1:10:59.238 --> 1:11:00.908
You're sleeping together,
you two.

1:11:00.943 --> 1:11:03.449
-Oh, my God, Mom.
-Don't deny it.

1:11:03.484 --> 1:11:04.879
You're having sex.

1:11:04.914 --> 1:11:07.046
-I can tell.
-Okay.

1:11:07.081 --> 1:11:09.246
Peaches can tell,
for crying out loud.

1:11:09.281 --> 1:11:10.720
All right.

1:11:10.755 --> 1:11:13.382
You and Coach
are doing sex moves?

1:11:13.417 --> 1:11:15.923
Okay. Bye.

1:11:23.394 --> 1:11:23.997
Hey.

1:11:26.573 --> 1:11:27.138
Wh-What are you doing?

1:11:27.174 --> 1:11:30.938
Uh... waiting on an Uber.

1:11:32.106 --> 1:11:33.908
Come on, are you just
gonna run away?

1:11:33.943 --> 1:11:35.613
No.

1:11:36.946 --> 1:11:40.079
Well, yeah. I mean...

1:11:40.114 --> 1:11:44.248
I just wasn't feeling
terribly welcome.

1:11:45.416 --> 1:11:48.956
Hey, by the way,
I love your mom.

1:11:48.991 --> 1:11:50.925
She's very colorful.

1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:53.433
Okay.
Why'd you come here tonight?

1:11:55.635 --> 1:11:57.767
Meat loaf Mondays.
You invited me.

1:11:57.802 --> 1:11:59.637
I didn't invite you. Johnny did.

1:12:01.542 --> 1:12:03.102
Okay.

1:12:03.137 --> 1:12:05.940
Seriously?

1:12:05.975 --> 1:12:07.975
I mean, come on.

1:12:08.010 --> 1:12:10.142
What are we doing here?

1:12:10.177 --> 1:12:13.079
You don't want me
to come to your house.

1:12:13.114 --> 1:12:15.752
We got to sneak off under
the bleachers to steal a kiss.

1:12:15.787 --> 1:12:18.018
Like, you know,
we're not in junior high.

1:12:18.053 --> 1:12:19.492
Wh-What...

1:12:19.527 --> 1:12:21.417
What's...
what is the big secret?

1:12:21.452 --> 1:12:23.661
I-I don't know.

1:12:25.566 --> 1:12:28.292
Look, I-I...
I like to keep my personal life

1:12:28.327 --> 1:12:30.360
and my family life separate,
okay?

1:12:34.135 --> 1:12:35.871
I just know from experience

1:12:35.906 --> 1:12:38.643
that if I get involved
with a guy, you know,

1:12:38.678 --> 1:12:43.472
and Johnny finds out about it,
then he gets attached.

1:12:43.507 --> 1:12:47.784
And if it doesn't work out,
then he can get very hurt,

1:12:47.819 --> 1:12:49.082
and I... I won't do that to him.

1:12:52.384 --> 1:12:54.219
Okay.

1:12:56.322 --> 1:12:59.356
You ever think maybe...

1:12:59.391 --> 1:13:03.569
you're hiding behind Johnny?

1:13:11.403 --> 1:13:14.041
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

1:13:16.507 --> 1:13:18.848
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:13:21.248 --> 1:13:23.347
-Well, okay.
-Okay.

1:13:44.436 --> 1:13:46.040
<i>There you go.</i>

1:13:46.075 --> 1:13:47.778
That's it. Move those feet.

1:13:47.813 --> 1:13:49.076
That's what we're gonna
work on today.

1:13:49.111 --> 1:13:51.716
Good job. Good job!

1:13:51.751 --> 1:13:54.719
I have Down syndrome.
I'm not deaf.

1:13:54.754 --> 1:13:56.512
-Got it, slick?

1:13:56.547 --> 1:13:57.920
Got it.

1:13:57.955 --> 1:13:58.921
-Cool, cool. Yeah.

1:13:58.956 --> 1:14:01.660
I'm gonna be with
the rest of the guys.

1:14:03.730 --> 1:14:04.762
Hey, Eeyore.

1:14:04.797 --> 1:14:08.293
What's the matter,
girlfriend problems?

1:14:09.461 --> 1:14:11.428
I-I don't have a girlfriend.

1:14:11.463 --> 1:14:13.265
Makes sense.

1:14:13.300 --> 1:14:15.498
Oh, what, am I that bad-looking?

1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:18.501
You're no McConaughey.

1:14:25.411 --> 1:14:27.653
Coach, I wrote down
what I want to say to my boss.

1:14:27.688 --> 1:14:28.984
-Is there any way

1:14:29.019 --> 1:14:30.480
that you can read it?

1:14:30.515 --> 1:14:31.987
Uh, yeah, I'll look at it later.

1:14:32.022 --> 1:14:33.318
Go on. Get...

1:14:33.353 --> 1:14:35.991
Johnny? Come here.

1:14:36.026 --> 1:14:39.159
Your sister and I
are just friends.

1:14:39.194 --> 1:14:40.556
I'm not a child.

1:14:40.591 --> 1:14:41.260
I know what you're up to.

1:14:41.295 --> 1:14:43.735
Okay, okay.

1:14:43.770 --> 1:14:46.738
We... we were involved,

1:14:46.773 --> 1:14:48.333
but we're not anymore.

1:14:48.368 --> 1:14:51.270
-Hey, hey, hey.

1:14:51.305 --> 1:14:53.305
I thought you wanted to go live
with the three amigos.

1:14:53.340 --> 1:14:56.407
Why... why didn't you tell
your sister?

1:14:56.442 --> 1:15:00.477
I want to go,
but good guys don't leave.

1:15:00.512 --> 1:15:03.953
I was a kid
and they made fun of me.

1:15:03.988 --> 1:15:05.449
Alex beat them up.

1:15:05.484 --> 1:15:07.319
She did. She beat them up.

1:15:07.354 --> 1:15:09.486
So I don't want to leave her.

1:15:10.555 --> 1:15:15.261
My dad left my mom
after I was born,

1:15:15.296 --> 1:15:16.229
so I don't leave Mom either.

1:15:19.564 --> 1:15:21.531
Yeah.

1:15:21.566 --> 1:15:24.534
Well, anyway, just, uh,
stop giving me the stink eye.

1:15:24.569 --> 1:15:25.645
Okay.

1:15:26.846 --> 1:15:28.175
You're still giving me
the stink eye, Johnny.

1:15:28.210 --> 1:15:29.308
-I'm not.
-You are.

1:15:29.343 --> 1:15:30.848
-Not!
-You are.

1:15:30.883 --> 1:15:32.817
Ei-ei.

1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.396
Marcus.

1:15:51.431 --> 1:15:53.706
Ah. Hey, Phil.

1:15:53.741 --> 1:15:55.367
What are you doing here?

1:15:55.402 --> 1:15:58.007
Uh, food's good.
Got to eat, right?

1:15:58.042 --> 1:15:59.745
-How you doing?

1:15:59.780 --> 1:16:01.010
Doing all right?

1:16:01.045 --> 1:16:03.815
Ah, I'm hanging in.

1:16:03.850 --> 1:16:06.543
I read about you in the paper.
The Friends.

1:16:06.578 --> 1:16:08.215
Oh, yeah. That's a...

1:16:08.250 --> 1:16:10.646
No, no, no, no. It's-it's great.

1:16:10.681 --> 1:16:12.516
How are you making out
with Darius Rhodes over there?

1:16:12.551 --> 1:16:14.584
You know Darius?

1:16:14.619 --> 1:16:16.223
I coached him.

1:16:18.392 --> 1:16:21.030
Uh, ma'am?
Can I get a cup of coffee?

1:16:21.065 --> 1:16:22.658
You coached Darius?

1:16:22.693 --> 1:16:25.232
Well, in a sense.

1:16:26.268 --> 1:16:29.566
He showed up at a youth camp

1:16:29.601 --> 1:16:31.909
when I was coaching
here at Drake.

1:16:31.944 --> 1:16:36.012
Ten years old
with a handle like Iverson

1:16:36.047 --> 1:16:38.575
and a smile that lit up the gym.

1:16:38.610 --> 1:16:44.119
I was thinking, "I might be
recruiting this kid someday."

1:16:44.154 --> 1:16:47.683
The next summer,
he's not at the camp.

1:16:47.718 --> 1:16:50.895
I find out he's been
in a terrible car accident.

1:16:50.930 --> 1:16:52.688
Traumatic brain injury.

1:16:54.758 --> 1:16:56.593
-Brutal.
-God.

1:16:56.628 --> 1:16:58.529
I get the job in Fresno,

1:16:58.564 --> 1:17:00.872
but I kept in touch
with the family over the years.

1:17:03.272 --> 1:17:04.601
He won't play for me.

1:17:04.636 --> 1:17:07.703
Yeah? Huh.

1:17:07.738 --> 1:17:11.674
Is there any way...
you could talk to him?

1:17:12.776 --> 1:17:15.117
No. It's got to be you.

1:17:29.001 --> 1:17:30.264
Yeah?

1:17:30.299 --> 1:17:32.233
Julio told me where you live.

1:17:32.268 --> 1:17:34.136
I got to go to work soon, so...

1:17:34.171 --> 1:17:35.302
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:17:35.337 --> 1:17:37.909
Just give me one second.

1:17:37.944 --> 1:17:38.976
Okay.

1:17:39.011 --> 1:17:42.914
I-I talked to your old coach,
Perretti.

1:17:42.949 --> 1:17:44.344
Perretti's my guy.

1:17:44.379 --> 1:17:46.313
Yeah, well, he's my guy, too.

1:17:46.348 --> 1:17:49.987
We're friends, and...

1:17:50.022 --> 1:17:52.616
I know...

1:17:52.651 --> 1:17:54.222
why you don't want
to play for me.

1:17:55.863 --> 1:17:58.292
I hate drunk drivers.

1:18:00.131 --> 1:18:01.757
Yeah, I get it.

1:18:01.792 --> 1:18:05.365
I-I mean, obviously,
I don't get it, get it,

1:18:05.400 --> 1:18:08.632
but I, uh...
you know, I-I get it.

1:18:08.667 --> 1:18:10.634
You still drink alcohol?

1:18:13.408 --> 1:18:14.880
Sometimes.

1:18:18.149 --> 1:18:19.676
Definitely not as much.

1:18:19.711 --> 1:18:21.579
You still drive drunk?

1:18:23.990 --> 1:18:27.519
Darius, you can choose
to believe me or not,

1:18:27.554 --> 1:18:30.896
but I know for a fact

1:18:30.931 --> 1:18:34.163
that I will never,
ever do that again.

1:18:37.069 --> 1:18:38.662
Never.

1:18:43.603 --> 1:18:45.174
Okay.

1:18:47.376 --> 1:18:49.112
You're not gonna ask me to play?

1:18:50.951 --> 1:18:52.709
Nope.

1:18:52.744 --> 1:18:55.514
I just wanted you to know
that I know.

1:18:56.682 --> 1:18:57.890
And I get it.

1:19:17.802 --> 1:19:20.176
See you Saturday.

1:19:20.211 --> 1:19:22.244
Wait a minute.

1:19:22.279 --> 1:19:24.114
Congratulations are in order.

1:19:24.149 --> 1:19:26.743
What do you mean?
We haven't won anything yet.

1:19:26.778 --> 1:19:30.087
No, but your 90 days are up.

1:19:30.122 --> 1:19:32.089
You're a free man, Marcus.

1:19:33.125 --> 1:19:35.125
Really?

1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:37.193
Huh.

1:19:37.228 --> 1:19:40.295
Ooh, boy. That flew by.

1:19:42.629 --> 1:19:45.201
Well, uh, okay, Julio.

1:19:45.236 --> 1:19:47.566
We'll see you Saturday.

1:19:50.978 --> 1:19:53.077
This is one
big thing, and it's a good one.

1:19:53.112 --> 1:19:55.211
Jalen, you remember
your boy Marcus Marakovich

1:19:55.246 --> 1:19:56.608
of the Iowa Stallions?

1:19:56.643 --> 1:19:58.709
The hothead assistant?

1:19:58.744 --> 1:20:01.316
That's the one, the jabroni who
was throwing hands at his boss.

1:20:01.351 --> 1:20:02.713
Well, he got fired.

1:20:02.748 --> 1:20:04.583
"Jabroni"? Really?

1:20:04.618 --> 1:20:07.652
-No surprise there.
-Smug-ass, alien-headed freak.

1:20:07.687 --> 1:20:09.962
But the surprising thing is
that now he's the head coach

1:20:09.997 --> 1:20:11.920
of a juggernaut of a squad,

1:20:11.955 --> 1:20:14.395
a team of Special Olympics
athletes called The Friends

1:20:14.430 --> 1:20:15.462
in Des Moines, Iowa.

1:20:15.497 --> 1:20:17.002
Now, check this out.

1:20:17.037 --> 1:20:18.597
As you can see,
it's-it's cell phone video

1:20:18.632 --> 1:20:20.467
or something from
somebody's phone, but it's fine.

1:20:20.502 --> 1:20:22.271
He's coaching his tail off.

1:20:22.306 --> 1:20:24.174
You know what?
I respect the grind.

1:20:24.209 --> 1:20:25.604
I see you, Marcus.

1:20:25.639 --> 1:20:27.243
The Friends
are just one win away

1:20:27.278 --> 1:20:28.981
from qualifying for
the regional tournament.

1:20:29.016 --> 1:20:30.279
We hope you make it
to the dance, Coach.

1:20:30.314 --> 1:20:31.445
We'll be watching.

1:20:31.480 --> 1:20:33.414
Yeah, you watch, Van Pelt.

1:20:33.449 --> 1:20:35.449
Let's go, Friends!

1:20:35.484 --> 1:20:37.352
Give the people what they want.

1:20:37.387 --> 1:20:40.322
Sir, I work very hard for you,

1:20:40.357 --> 1:20:43.787
and I deserve to have
a say in my schedule.

1:20:43.822 --> 1:20:45.690
I love basketball.

1:20:45.725 --> 1:20:49.628
We have a big game on Saturday,

1:20:49.663 --> 1:20:52.763
and all I want is
to play in that game.

1:20:52.798 --> 1:20:56.437
I can do better.
I can do better.

1:20:56.472 --> 1:20:58.835
Sir, I work very hard for you.

1:21:02.742 --> 1:21:04.940
Hey, Coach.

1:21:04.975 --> 1:21:07.283
Hey. You made it.

1:21:07.318 --> 1:21:10.055
-Yeah, I made it.
-Ah, great!

1:21:13.060 --> 1:21:17.986
Uh, so, uh, what did
your jackass boss say to you

1:21:18.021 --> 1:21:19.328
when you stood up to him?

1:21:19.363 --> 1:21:22.331
He said, "You're fired."

1:21:22.366 --> 1:21:25.070
Oh. I'm... I'm-I'm sorry.

1:21:25.105 --> 1:21:27.072
Ah. It's okay.

1:21:27.107 --> 1:21:29.668
-Let's go.
- Okay.

1:21:37.513 --> 1:21:39.183
Pass it down.

1:21:41.088 --> 1:21:43.517
-That's the shot, baby!

1:21:43.552 --> 1:21:44.815
-Yes! Yes.
-Oh.

1:21:47.919 --> 1:21:50.590
Okay, good defense. Defense!

1:21:50.625 --> 1:21:52.262
♪ You remind me of a boy... ♪

1:21:52.297 --> 1:21:54.165
-Oh, that's okay.

1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:57.861
♪ When he cut me like a saw
with his back-and-forth ♪

1:21:57.896 --> 1:21:59.929
♪ And I remind you
of someone... ♪

1:21:59.964 --> 1:22:01.997
That's it. There you go.

1:22:02.032 --> 1:22:04.901
Guys, work it around.
Work it around the perimeter.

1:22:04.936 --> 1:22:06.177

Johnny. Go in for Craig.

1:22:26.166 --> 1:22:29.057
-No.
-No? What do you mean, "no"?

1:22:29.092 --> 1:22:31.301
Come on. We need your scoring.
We need your pick-and-roll.

1:22:31.336 --> 1:22:33.930
I don't want to do
the pick-and-roll anymore.

1:22:33.965 --> 1:22:37.208
I don't want you
to have any more hard-ons!

1:22:37.243 --> 1:22:39.111
Okay. You know what? Fine.
You just sit there.

1:22:39.146 --> 1:22:41.212
Marlon, go in for Craig.

1:22:41.247 --> 1:22:44.314
I would, Coach, but I'm having
a bit of a thrombosis flare-up.

1:22:44.349 --> 1:22:46.646

Okay, guys,
we need a big second half

1:23:04.369 --> 1:23:06.435
if we're gonna make it
to Winnipeg.

1:23:06.470 --> 1:23:08.063
-Nice. Nice.
-Thanks, Coach.

1:23:08.098 --> 1:23:09.603
Way to go, you guys.

1:23:09.638 --> 1:23:12.001
Get a little water. Rest up.

1:23:13.444 --> 1:23:15.939
No. Players only.

1:23:15.974 --> 1:23:17.512
What are you talking about,
Cosentino?

1:23:17.547 --> 1:23:19.580
-Get out of the way.
-Players only.

1:23:19.615 --> 1:23:22.011
If you come near me,
I'll "Me Too" your ass.

1:23:22.046 --> 1:23:23.617
Okay.

1:23:32.793 --> 1:23:35.299
-It's players only.
-Yeah, I heard.

1:23:36.995 --> 1:23:38.929
Hey. What's your problem?

1:23:38.964 --> 1:23:40.634
I don't want to play for Coach.

1:23:40.669 --> 1:23:42.306
You don't have to play
for Coach.

1:23:42.341 --> 1:23:43.670
We play for each other.

1:23:43.705 --> 1:23:45.672
-Right?
-That's right. -Yeah.

1:23:45.707 --> 1:23:47.443
-I agree with that, yes.
-Nice one.

1:23:47.478 --> 1:23:51.216
And your sister is
a grown woman who can have sex

1:23:51.251 --> 1:23:55.044
with whoever she wants,
even a dogface like Coach.

1:23:55.079 --> 1:23:57.486
-You know about that?
-Yeah. We all know.

1:23:57.521 --> 1:24:00.016
There was a vibe.
You just didn't want to see it.

1:24:00.051 --> 1:24:02.524
We need you,
so snap the fuck out of it.

1:24:02.559 --> 1:24:04.295
-Oh, yes!

1:24:04.330 --> 1:24:06.297
-Let's do this!

1:24:08.158 --> 1:24:10.400
Yes. I love it.

1:24:10.435 --> 1:24:12.094
Put me in, Coach.

1:24:14.373 --> 1:24:15.900
You're welcome.

1:24:18.773 --> 1:24:20.311
Okay.

1:24:20.346 --> 1:24:22.247
Yeah, let's go!

1:24:27.386 --> 1:24:28.847
-Oh! Yeah!

1:24:44.964 --> 1:24:46.403
Whoa!

1:24:52.279 --> 1:24:54.246
-Oh, yeah! Yeah!

1:24:54.281 --> 1:24:55.940
That's it!

1:24:59.484 --> 1:25:01.715
-Yes! -Yeah!
-Yes!

1:25:01.750 --> 1:25:03.046
Not in my house.

1:25:05.787 --> 1:25:08.117
-We did it! Yeah!

1:25:08.152 --> 1:25:10.526
-Going to Winnipeg!
-Canada!

1:25:10.561 --> 1:25:12.022
Special Olympics!

1:25:12.057 --> 1:25:14.893
- Canada. Canada.

1:25:18.261 --> 1:25:20.437
-Yeah.
-Way to go, guys.

1:25:20.472 --> 1:25:21.933
-All right.

1:25:21.968 --> 1:25:23.473
Shower up.
I'll be in in a minute.

1:25:23.508 --> 1:25:24.174
-Good game.
-Watch your head, Showtime.

1:25:24.209 --> 1:25:26.641
Good job, Sonny. Great coaching.

1:25:26.676 --> 1:25:28.445
Thanks, Coach.

1:25:29.415 --> 1:25:31.481
Hey.

1:25:31.516 --> 1:25:34.242
Oh. Hey.

1:25:34.277 --> 1:25:37.718
Congratulations.
That was quite a game.

1:25:37.753 --> 1:25:39.984
-Thank you.
-And you got Johnny to play.

1:25:40.019 --> 1:25:42.756
Uh, well, it wasn't me,
but I'm glad he played.

1:25:42.791 --> 1:25:45.154
-We needed him.
-Yeah.

1:25:45.189 --> 1:25:47.123
Yeah. So, uh...

1:25:48.830 --> 1:25:52.403
-I-I'm sorry that I got
all up into your business. -No.

1:25:52.438 --> 1:25:55.439
Don't apologize. I'm sorry.

1:25:55.474 --> 1:25:59.476
And I-I wanted you to know that
I did hear what you were saying.

1:25:59.511 --> 1:26:01.445
Um...

1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:04.481
And it looks like someone
wants to talk to you, so...

1:26:05.550 --> 1:26:07.484
Oh.

1:26:07.519 --> 1:26:10.685
We'll talk soon. Okay.

1:26:12.183 --> 1:26:14.018
Well, fancy seeing you here.

1:26:14.053 --> 1:26:18.154
Congrats on the win.
Team looks good.

1:26:18.189 --> 1:26:21.465
Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming.

1:26:21.500 --> 1:26:24.028
Uh... what's up?

1:26:24.063 --> 1:26:26.965
My mama's a Christian.

1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:29.000
She wants me to forgive
the lady that hit me.

1:26:29.035 --> 1:26:31.607
I've tried, but I can't.

1:26:31.642 --> 1:26:34.676
But I thought maybe
I could practice on you.

1:26:35.844 --> 1:26:39.516
So, I'll play for you,
Coach, in regionals.

1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:42.882
Are you messing with me
right now?

1:26:42.917 --> 1:26:44.455
Nope.

1:26:49.759 --> 1:26:52.859
I think... I think I might cry.

1:26:52.894 --> 1:26:54.465
Thank you.

1:26:54.500 --> 1:26:56.027
You made an old man happy.

1:26:56.062 --> 1:26:58.535
Go tell the guys.
I'll be right in.

1:26:58.570 --> 1:27:00.537
Welcome to the team.

1:27:03.509 --> 1:27:06.675
Darius! Darius! Darius!

1:27:06.710 --> 1:27:09.876
Darius. Darius. Darius.

1:27:09.911 --> 1:27:12.813
-Darius! Darius! Darius!

1:27:22.528 --> 1:27:24.154
Thank you.

1:27:24.189 --> 1:27:26.893
Yeah, Kenny. Hey.

1:27:26.928 --> 1:27:29.797
Yeah, I can talk.
Just on my way to practice.

1:27:31.867 --> 1:27:33.438
O-Okay.

1:27:36.267 --> 1:27:38.674
Are you kidding me?

1:27:38.709 --> 1:27:41.039
You better not be kidding me.

1:27:41.074 --> 1:27:43.239
Oh, my God.

1:27:43.274 --> 1:27:46.341
Oh, my God.

1:27:46.376 --> 1:27:48.453
I-I'll call you in a minute.

1:27:49.753 --> 1:27:52.622
Okay. Uh, guys, listen.

1:27:52.657 --> 1:27:55.020
Before we roll
the basketballs out,

1:27:55.055 --> 1:27:59.024
I-I want to try
a little experiment, okay?

1:27:59.059 --> 1:28:01.400
Everybody, close your eyes.

1:28:03.228 --> 1:28:05.096
Take a deep breath.

1:28:06.297 --> 1:28:09.133
And... go inside your mind
for a minute.

1:28:09.168 --> 1:28:12.235
It's very dark in here, Coach.

1:28:12.270 --> 1:28:14.138
That-That's okay, Marlon.
That's fine.

1:28:14.173 --> 1:28:16.580
But I-I just want you
to keep breathing,

1:28:16.615 --> 1:28:22.278
and I want you to use your
imagination and visualize this.

1:28:22.313 --> 1:28:26.590
We are up in Winnipeg.

1:28:26.625 --> 1:28:30.121
Championship game
has just ended.

1:28:30.156 --> 1:28:32.662
We are at center court,

1:28:32.697 --> 1:28:37.326
jumping up and down,
celebrating.

1:28:37.361 --> 1:28:40.571
Streamers and confetti
are falling,

1:28:40.606 --> 1:28:45.972
and the crowd is cheering us
because we are champions!

1:28:49.549 --> 1:28:51.241
Okay, you can
open your eyes now.

1:28:51.276 --> 1:28:52.946
Anybody see that?

1:28:52.981 --> 1:28:55.014
No.

1:28:55.049 --> 1:28:57.654
Winnipeg looked very cold,
so I came here.

1:28:57.689 --> 1:28:59.656
I saw it, Coach. I did.

1:28:59.691 --> 1:29:02.087
-Nice, Benny.
-Me, too.

1:29:02.122 --> 1:29:03.319
Ah. Great, Showtime.
Okay, we're good, good.

1:29:03.354 --> 1:29:06.498
We'll just keep working on this
because I want you guys

1:29:06.533 --> 1:29:11.261
to just, you know,
get that picture in your mind

1:29:11.296 --> 1:29:13.131
because it's gonna happen.

1:29:13.166 --> 1:29:16.871
We're going to Winnipeg,
and we're gonna be champions!

1:29:16.906 --> 1:29:19.676
-Yeah!

1:29:21.372 --> 1:29:25.341
And I'm going to the NBA,
to Seattle,

1:29:25.376 --> 1:29:28.982
because they hired me
to coach up there!

1:29:32.152 --> 1:29:35.857
Seattle... sucks.

1:29:37.025 --> 1:29:39.861
Well, i-it's an expansion team.

1:29:39.896 --> 1:29:41.698
You know, it's a process.

1:29:41.733 --> 1:29:44.602
Well, who's gonna coach us
next season, then?

1:29:45.737 --> 1:29:47.836
I-I don't know. Maybe Julio.

1:29:47.871 --> 1:29:50.300
Good guys don't leave!

1:29:50.335 --> 1:29:53.006
Yeah, Johnny, they do.

1:29:53.041 --> 1:29:56.174
When the NBA calls, they leave.

1:29:56.209 --> 1:29:59.716
I should've known.

1:29:59.751 --> 1:30:03.313
You know,
it would've been really nice

1:30:03.348 --> 1:30:07.185
for you guys to just give me
a little congratulations.

1:30:08.859 --> 1:30:12.388
C-Congrat... congrat...

1:30:12.423 --> 1:30:15.765
congr-gr-gratulations, Coach.

1:30:15.800 --> 1:30:18.097
We'll miss you.

1:30:18.132 --> 1:30:20.264
Thank you, Arthur.

1:30:36.282 --> 1:30:37.380
Hey.

1:30:38.449 --> 1:30:41.153
Hey. You're done early.

1:30:42.585 --> 1:30:45.597
Yeah, yeah. Uh, they, uh...

1:30:47.062 --> 1:30:48.732
Great news.

1:30:48.767 --> 1:30:51.295
Yeah, I, uh...

1:30:51.330 --> 1:30:56.267
got an NBA job in Seattle,
third assistant.

1:30:56.302 --> 1:30:59.567
Which means, you know,
I-I'll be on the bench,

1:30:59.602 --> 1:31:01.712
not one of those schmucks
sitting in the second row.

1:31:03.243 --> 1:31:05.881
Yeah, it's a...

1:31:05.916 --> 1:31:07.080
pretty big deal.

1:31:07.115 --> 1:31:08.543
Wow.

1:31:08.578 --> 1:31:11.315
That's... that's great.

1:31:11.350 --> 1:31:12.789
Yeah.

1:31:12.824 --> 1:31:14.120
Did you tell The Friends?

1:31:14.155 --> 1:31:15.484
Yeah. Yeah.

1:31:15.519 --> 1:31:17.959
Uh...

1:31:17.994 --> 1:31:21.996
They weren't exactly thrilled,
uh...

1:31:22.031 --> 1:31:27.562
as you might imagine, and, uh,
Johnny, pissed at me, again.

1:31:27.597 --> 1:31:29.333
Hmm. Yeah. Of course he's upset.

1:31:29.368 --> 1:31:31.973
He's attached to you.
They all are.

1:31:33.438 --> 1:31:36.505
Man, what does it take
to get an "attaboy" around here?

1:31:37.684 --> 1:31:39.442
I'm sorry. Congratulations.

1:31:39.477 --> 1:31:41.411
I know it's what you wanted.

1:31:41.446 --> 1:31:43.853
Thank you.

1:31:43.888 --> 1:31:46.614
Really, I-I owe it all
to The Friends.

1:31:46.649 --> 1:31:48.759
I, uh...

1:31:48.794 --> 1:31:52.158
Apparently, Seattle's getting
roughed up in the press,

1:31:52.193 --> 1:31:54.996
needed a feel-good story,
you know,

1:31:55.031 --> 1:31:57.493
to change the subject,
and, uh...

1:31:57.528 --> 1:31:59.594
Look at me. Mr. Feel-Good.

1:32:02.401 --> 1:32:04.742
It's a little exploitative,
though, isn't it?

1:32:05.910 --> 1:32:08.009
No. I'm not exploiting anybody.

1:32:08.044 --> 1:32:11.947
I'm... I would...
I would never...

1:32:11.982 --> 1:32:14.884
You know that I love these guys.

1:32:16.217 --> 1:32:19.515
I mean, you were court ordered
to care, so...

1:32:19.550 --> 1:32:20.857
It's not exactly the same.

1:32:20.892 --> 1:32:23.057
That's not fair. You...

1:32:25.160 --> 1:32:27.259
I thought we were okay.

1:32:27.525 --> 1:32:31.395
Why are you being
so shitty about this?

1:32:34.202 --> 1:32:36.466
Honestly, 'cause you just
get to drop into our lives

1:32:36.501 --> 1:32:38.600
and mess everything up
and then just walk away.

1:32:41.539 --> 1:32:43.913
I seem to remember
you telling me

1:32:43.948 --> 1:32:47.675
that you have no interest
in getting involved.

1:32:47.710 --> 1:32:50.051
Yeah, I did,
and then it changed.

1:32:50.086 --> 1:32:51.514
And you know it changed.

1:32:51.549 --> 1:32:53.351
Okay.
I knew they changed for me.

1:32:53.386 --> 1:32:55.925
I didn't know they changed
for you until just now.

1:32:55.960 --> 1:32:58.257
Happy to hear you
acknowledge that.

1:32:58.292 --> 1:33:00.094
Yeah.

1:33:00.129 --> 1:33:03.262
I was never staying
in Des Moines after my 90 days.

1:33:03.297 --> 1:33:04.736
You knew that.

1:33:04.771 --> 1:33:06.397
You know, you could have
at least pretended

1:33:06.432 --> 1:33:08.564
it was gonna be hard to leave.

1:33:08.599 --> 1:33:10.401
You know, maybe you could've
said you were gonna miss me.

1:33:10.436 --> 1:33:12.744
You're right. You're right.

1:33:15.111 --> 1:33:19.047
-Well, I-I will miss you.

1:33:19.082 --> 1:33:20.576
Oh, good. Cool. Yeah.

1:33:20.611 --> 1:33:22.578
-I will.
-It's too late.

1:33:51.279 --> 1:33:53.279
Okay, guys.

1:33:53.314 --> 1:33:55.787
I realize,
after the last practice,

1:33:55.822 --> 1:33:59.285
there were some feelings
about my leaving,

1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:02.222
but we still have
a job to do in Winnipeg.

1:34:02.257 --> 1:34:03.993
Get over yourself, jackass.

1:34:04.028 --> 1:34:05.555
We can't go
to the tournament anymore.

1:34:05.590 --> 1:34:07.590
What? Why not?

1:34:07.625 --> 1:34:09.295
We don't have the money.

1:34:09.330 --> 1:34:11.099
I appealed to the city,

1:34:11.134 --> 1:34:13.761
I appealed to the state,
and nothing.

1:34:13.796 --> 1:34:16.940
The city sucks. The state sucks.

1:34:16.975 --> 1:34:19.173
Well, there's been budget cuts.

1:34:19.208 --> 1:34:22.605
Yeah, but, well,
there's got to be a way, Julio.

1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:23.980
Uh, how much could it be?

1:34:24.015 --> 1:34:25.850
Well, it's in Canada, Marcus.

1:34:25.885 --> 1:34:29.678
That's airplane tickets,
hotel rooms, uh, long johns.

1:34:29.713 --> 1:34:31.284
Uh, it adds up.

1:34:32.892 --> 1:34:35.552
The guys are all
looking forward to curling.

1:35:59.407 --> 1:36:00.912
A little afternoon quickie?

1:36:00.947 --> 1:36:03.244
Mom. (scoffs) Good God. Go.

1:36:03.279 --> 1:36:05.543
-I'm just trying to be helpful.
-Go. Go.

1:36:09.219 --> 1:36:10.779
What do you want?

1:36:10.814 --> 1:36:13.925
Well, if that quickie thing's
on the menu...

1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:16.521
-It's not.
-Okay. Not funny.

1:36:16.556 --> 1:36:19.458
Uh, I need a favor.

1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:23.264
Wow.

1:36:23.299 --> 1:36:25.398
What? No, it's not for me.
It's for The Friends.

1:36:25.433 --> 1:36:26.729
What is it?

1:36:26.764 --> 1:36:29.039
Well, I need you
to put on a little show.

1:36:34.574 --> 1:36:36.310
See that?

1:36:36.345 --> 1:36:39.280
Damn, these costumes are great.

1:36:39.315 --> 1:36:41.645
Think we can pull this off?

1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:44.923
This is my basketball, Marcus.
Just follow my lead.

1:36:50.029 --> 1:36:53.162
We're looking for O'Connolly.

1:36:54.198 --> 1:36:56.594
Okay.

1:36:56.629 --> 1:36:58.629
Right this way.

1:36:58.664 --> 1:37:02.138
I've got nothing to hide.

1:37:02.173 --> 1:37:05.009
I have no illegals
working in my kitchen.

1:37:05.044 --> 1:37:07.176
Illegals? Really?

1:37:07.211 --> 1:37:08.980
Sorry. Mexicans.

1:37:09.015 --> 1:37:11.180
Oh, don't apologize to me.

1:37:11.215 --> 1:37:14.678
-Apologize to my partner,
Sanchez. -Hmm?

1:37:16.121 --> 1:37:19.518
Oh, sorry, Officer Sanchez.

1:37:19.553 --> 1:37:21.454
No problem...o.

1:37:21.489 --> 1:37:23.753
You have no idea
how sorry you are.

1:37:23.788 --> 1:37:26.096
Do you know what's on here,
Mr. O'Connolly?

1:37:26.131 --> 1:37:27.922
Uh, no.

1:37:27.957 --> 1:37:30.496
It's video and statements
from your employees

1:37:30.531 --> 1:37:33.202
proving that you've created
a hostile work environment.

1:37:33.237 --> 1:37:35.666
It demonstrates a pattern
of abusive behavior,

1:37:35.701 --> 1:37:37.635
particularly towards
a dishwasher

1:37:37.670 --> 1:37:39.703
named Benjamin Weaver.

1:37:39.738 --> 1:37:41.705
-Benny?
-Yeah.

1:37:41.740 --> 1:37:43.839
A former employee with
intellectual disabilities,

1:37:43.874 --> 1:37:46.116
thanks to whom you,
Mr. O'Connolly,

1:37:46.151 --> 1:37:49.647
I'm assuming received
quite a sizeable tax benefit.

1:37:49.682 --> 1:37:51.352
Well, hang on here a minute.

1:37:51.387 --> 1:37:53.387
Hang on my dick and balls,
okay?!

1:37:53.422 --> 1:37:54.817
Here's what we could do.

1:37:54.852 --> 1:37:57.622
We could point Mr. Weaver
to an attorney

1:37:57.657 --> 1:37:59.987
or we could introduce him
to a reporter at<i> The Beacon</i>

1:38:00.022 --> 1:38:01.527
'cause I just have this sense

1:38:01.562 --> 1:38:02.858
that it could be
such a great story.

1:38:02.893 --> 1:38:05.069
Don't you agree, Sanchez?

1:38:05.104 --> 1:38:07.335
<i>Sí.</i>

1:38:07.370 --> 1:38:08.732
What are your thoughts on that?

1:38:10.670 --> 1:38:12.307
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:38:12.342 --> 1:38:14.078
Whoa, um...

1:38:14.113 --> 1:38:15.673
surely, uh...

1:38:16.874 --> 1:38:20.645
...there must be something
I can do.

1:38:41.030 --> 1:38:42.832
Hey, Coach, is there a pool?

1:38:42.867 --> 1:38:44.702
There better be a pool.

1:38:44.737 --> 1:38:46.209
Oh, I'm sure there's a pool,

1:38:46.244 --> 1:38:48.211
but, uh, this is not
a ski resort,

1:38:48.246 --> 1:38:48.778
so why do you have the skis?

1:38:48.813 --> 1:38:51.115
Don't worry about it.

1:38:52.712 --> 1:38:54.250
Okay.

1:39:11.995 --> 1:39:14.270
-Yeah!

1:39:15.438 --> 1:39:18.208
Is it everything
you were hoping for, Marlon?

1:39:18.243 --> 1:39:20.540
It's even better
than I expected!

1:39:20.575 --> 1:39:21.871
Whoo!

1:39:31.685 --> 1:39:33.124
Hey, hey, guys.

1:39:33.159 --> 1:39:34.884
Now, you had a big day.

1:39:34.919 --> 1:39:37.293
I know you're all tired,

1:39:37.328 --> 1:39:41.165
but tomorrow,
we got the gold medal game,

1:39:41.200 --> 1:39:44.267
so I need you
to go back to your room

1:39:44.302 --> 1:39:46.962
and get a good night's rest.

1:39:46.997 --> 1:39:48.832
-All right.
-Sure thing, Coach.

1:39:48.867 --> 1:39:49.899
-We'll do it.
All right.

1:39:49.934 --> 1:39:51.571
-Good night.
-All right.

1:39:51.606 --> 1:39:52.440
-Good night, Coach.
-All right, good night.

1:39:52.475 --> 1:39:53.639
-Bye.
-Good night.

1:39:54.840 --> 1:39:56.774
Look at you,
laying down the law.

1:39:56.809 --> 1:39:58.941
They respect me.

1:40:03.354 --> 1:40:06.113
Whoo!
Mush, mush, you filthy dogs!

1:40:08.227 --> 1:40:10.194
Whoo!

1:40:10.229 --> 1:40:11.756
Hey!

1:40:15.696 --> 1:40:17.597
That was rad.

1:40:29.710 --> 1:40:31.809
Coach.

1:40:31.844 --> 1:40:33.283
You have a minute?

1:40:33.318 --> 1:40:35.483
Oh. Sure.

1:40:35.518 --> 1:40:38.189
Great. Rolling?

1:40:38.224 --> 1:40:39.553
We've been following
your incredible story

1:40:39.588 --> 1:40:41.049
for a minute now, Coach.

1:40:41.084 --> 1:40:42.655
You're on your way to the NBA,
but first,

1:40:42.690 --> 1:40:43.953
some unfinished business.

1:40:43.988 --> 1:40:45.823
You're one win away

1:40:45.858 --> 1:40:48.397
from the Special Olympics
North American Regional title.

1:40:48.432 --> 1:40:49.860
How's it feel?

1:40:49.895 --> 1:40:51.664
Great.

1:40:51.699 --> 1:40:55.063
Uh, I'm just really excited
for my team, The Friends.

1:40:55.098 --> 1:40:59.034
Uh, you know, uh,
to have the chance

1:40:59.069 --> 1:41:04.512
to become champions
is a rare and special thing.

1:41:04.547 --> 1:41:06.910
Now, some are saying that
the front office in Seattle

1:41:06.945 --> 1:41:08.879
is using your hiring
as a distraction

1:41:08.914 --> 1:41:10.914
from the recent
in-house scandals.

1:41:10.949 --> 1:41:12.421
I mean,
do you feel that your team

1:41:12.456 --> 1:41:14.588
and their disabilities
are being exploited?

1:41:17.428 --> 1:41:20.726
Uh, no, I wouldn't say that.

1:41:20.761 --> 1:41:22.431
I-I, uh...

1:41:22.466 --> 1:41:25.830
I feel that I am
an NBA-caliber coach,

1:41:25.865 --> 1:41:31.198
and I will be an asset to them
on... on the bench.

1:41:31.233 --> 1:41:32.903
-Thank you, Coach.
-Mm.

1:41:32.938 --> 1:41:36.610
From Winnipeg,
I'm Blake Lassiter, ESPN.

1:41:36.645 --> 1:41:38.073
Clear? Great.

1:41:38.108 --> 1:41:40.251
What the hell was that?

1:41:40.286 --> 1:41:41.714
I had to ask, Coach.

1:41:41.749 --> 1:41:43.452
I'm a journalist.

1:41:43.487 --> 1:41:45.817
You're a troll.

1:41:47.326 --> 1:41:49.689
-Hey, guys. -ANNOUNCER:
Welcome to the Special Olympics

1:41:49.724 --> 1:41:51.757

all looking so freaked out?

is called The Beasts!

1:42:01.637 --> 1:42:03.032
They're the "beasts,"
we're the "friends."

1:42:03.067 --> 1:42:06.068
Based on our names,
I don't like our chances.

1:42:06.103 --> 1:42:08.609

-Aw, they're not that big.

1:42:08.644 --> 1:42:11.139

The Beasts are 15
over The Friends at the half.

1:44:29.081 --> 1:44:30.751
Uh, you know what?

1:44:30.786 --> 1:44:32.456
This isn't about Xs and Os.

1:44:32.491 --> 1:44:35.349
You guys got the Xs and Os down.

1:44:35.384 --> 1:44:37.428
Have a seat, Sonny.

1:44:42.424 --> 1:44:44.028
You know what?

1:44:44.063 --> 1:44:45.964
I get it.

1:44:45.999 --> 1:44:48.439
Those dudes are scary.

1:44:49.607 --> 1:44:53.840
But this is your shot
at being champions.

1:44:54.106 --> 1:44:56.106
And guess what.

1:44:56.141 --> 1:44:59.780
Champions are brave.

1:44:59.815 --> 1:45:02.310
That's what it means
to be a champion.

1:45:02.345 --> 1:45:04.147
Actually, the dictionary
definition of "champion" is...

1:45:04.182 --> 1:45:05.489
Not now, Marlon.

1:45:06.954 --> 1:45:10.626
You can't be afraid to fail.

1:45:10.661 --> 1:45:13.662
You can't be afraid to lose.

1:45:15.094 --> 1:45:18.733
You can do it
because I know you're brave.

1:45:18.768 --> 1:45:20.669
I've seen you.

1:45:20.704 --> 1:45:23.969
I've seen you do things
that were hard.

1:45:24.004 --> 1:45:27.038
Things that felt impossible.

1:45:28.338 --> 1:45:29.843
And I'm not just
talking as players.

1:45:29.878 --> 1:45:32.076
I'm talking as people.

1:45:32.111 --> 1:45:33.649
Benny...

1:45:33.684 --> 1:45:37.411
stood up to his boss,
risked his job.

1:45:37.446 --> 1:45:40.018
That was brave.

1:45:40.053 --> 1:45:41.283
He's a champion.

1:45:43.727 --> 1:45:45.925
Darius.

1:45:45.960 --> 1:45:47.663
You were brave enough
to give me a chance

1:45:47.698 --> 1:45:49.093
I probably didn't deserve.

1:45:49.128 --> 1:45:51.359
Champion.

1:45:54.034 --> 1:45:55.770
Cosentino.

1:45:55.805 --> 1:46:00.368
Hey, I don't know if
you're brave or batshit crazy,

1:46:00.403 --> 1:46:03.910
but I know you're a champion.

1:46:05.243 --> 1:46:09.311
I was scared when I had
my first three-way,

1:46:09.346 --> 1:46:11.555
but it was good.

1:46:12.657 --> 1:46:15.350
Yeah, okay. (chuckles) Champion.

1:46:17.519 --> 1:46:20.729
I mean, honestly,
the stuff you guys put up with

1:46:20.764 --> 1:46:24.227
from ignorant people every day.

1:46:24.262 --> 1:46:27.230
Come on.

1:46:27.265 --> 1:46:29.639
You're all brave.

1:46:29.674 --> 1:46:32.510
You are all champions.

1:46:34.580 --> 1:46:37.372
Let's go out there
and show those guys

1:46:37.407 --> 1:46:40.342
what champions
are made of, okay?

1:46:40.377 --> 1:46:42.146
-Huh?
All right!

1:46:42.181 --> 1:46:43.851
-Let's go!
-Yes!

1:46:43.886 --> 1:46:44.852
-Come on!
-Come on! Let's go!

1:46:44.887 --> 1:46:46.381
- -Yeah.
-Let's do it.

1:46:46.416 --> 1:46:47.723
Let's go! Yeah!

1:46:53.423 --> 1:46:55.423
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1:46:56.899 --> 1:46:58.899
Good, good.

1:46:58.934 --> 1:47:00.428
Ladies and gentlemen...

1:47:00.463 --> 1:47:02.199
Get some water. Stretch it out.

1:47:02.234 --> 1:47:04.674
...the Special Olympics'
second half is about to begin!

1:47:04.709 --> 1:47:06.467
Good. Get loose.

1:47:08.372 --> 1:47:09.910
Where are you going, Johnny?

1:47:09.945 --> 1:47:11.208
You're-you're supposed to be
on the court.

1:47:11.243 --> 1:47:13.441
I'm not a champion yet, Coach.

1:47:43.176 --> 1:47:45.748

Darius, you're gonna take
the final shot.

1:50:19.001 --> 1:50:20.903
We're gonna clear out
the right side

1:50:20.938 --> 1:50:23.037
-for you to iso, okay?
-Mm-hmm. Okay.

1:50:23.072 --> 1:50:24.907

What are, what are you
talking about?

1:50:26.768 --> 1:50:28.306
That's a terrible call, Marcus.
They're gonna trap him.

1:50:28.341 --> 1:50:29.604
It can't be Darius.
He has to be a decoy.

1:50:29.639 --> 1:50:33.245
Sonny, this is my team.
You're...

1:50:34.512 --> 1:50:36.578
Son of a bitch, you're right.

1:50:36.613 --> 1:50:39.317
They're gonna blitz Darius
the second he touches the ball.

1:50:39.352 --> 1:50:41.154
Johnny?

1:50:41.189 --> 1:50:43.090
Are you ready to run
the pick-and-roll?

1:50:43.125 --> 1:50:44.795
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

1:50:44.830 --> 1:50:47.292
Yeah, yeah.
You remember Hermione?

1:50:47.327 --> 1:50:48.898
Yep.

1:50:48.933 --> 1:50:50.493
-That's it. That's it.

1:50:50.528 --> 1:50:53.067
Okay, so you're gonna set
the screen for Darius,

1:50:53.102 --> 1:50:55.300
and then
when they double Darius,

1:50:55.335 --> 1:50:56.939
you're gonna roll to the basket.

1:50:56.974 --> 1:50:58.842
You should be wide open
for the easy layup, okay?

1:50:58.877 --> 1:51:01.636
-Yep. All right.
-Yeah? All right.

1:51:01.671 --> 1:51:03.275
Bring it in, everybody.

1:51:03.310 --> 1:51:04.914
-Come on.
-Okay. Here we go.

1:51:04.949 --> 1:51:08.445
One, two, three, Friends!

1:51:10.713 --> 1:51:12.317
Okay.

1:51:12.352 --> 1:51:14.517
-Set it up. Pick-and-roll.

1:51:14.552 --> 1:51:16.827
Yeah, Johnny. Yeah.

1:51:16.862 --> 1:51:18.521
Set the screen. Good.

1:51:18.556 --> 1:51:20.028
Yeah, now roll, roll.

1:51:20.063 --> 1:51:21.161
-Perfect! Yes!
I'm open.

1:51:21.196 --> 1:51:23.163
-I'm open!
Oh.

1:51:23.198 --> 1:51:25.000
No. No!

1:51:25.035 --> 1:51:26.199
Johnny, what are you doing?

1:51:26.234 --> 1:51:27.871
He said he was open.

1:51:27.906 --> 1:51:29.499
Showtime, no!

1:51:29.534 --> 1:51:32.469
No...!

1:51:53.591 --> 1:51:55.030
Ah.

1:51:55.065 --> 1:51:56.823
-So close.

1:51:58.904 --> 1:52:01.399
He hit the rim!
Showtime hit the rim!

1:52:01.434 --> 1:52:03.170
-He did it! He finally did it!

1:52:03.205 --> 1:52:05.073
-Way to go! Way to go!
-He hit the rim!

1:52:05.108 --> 1:52:06.734
-Showtime hit the rim!

1:52:06.769 --> 1:52:08.703
-You did it, man!
-I always believed in you.

1:52:08.738 --> 1:52:10.804
-That's right. He hit the rim.
-He was due.

1:52:10.839 --> 1:52:12.641
But he missed.

1:52:12.676 --> 1:52:13.543
-Good game, good game.
-Good game, guys. Good game.

1:52:19.122 --> 1:52:21.650

-Yeah!

1:54:19.539 --> 1:54:21.539
-Hey, good job.

1:54:24.379 --> 1:54:27.215
-12.2. Do you believe it?
-That's very impressive.

1:54:31.419 --> 1:54:35.520
So, Johnny's moving into
the group home with the guys.

1:54:35.555 --> 1:54:36.851
You know, I had a feeling.

1:54:38.195 --> 1:54:40.426
So, all good?

1:54:41.891 --> 1:54:43.561
Yeah. He's gonna be fine.

1:54:44.663 --> 1:54:47.334
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1:54:47.369 --> 1:54:49.237
Yeah. I'm good.

1:54:49.272 --> 1:54:52.141
Change is good, right?

1:54:52.176 --> 1:54:53.736
Yeah.

1:54:55.003 --> 1:54:58.741
So, speaking of change,
when are you off to Seattle?

1:54:58.776 --> 1:55:00.479
I'm not.

1:55:00.514 --> 1:55:02.151
What do you mean?

1:55:02.186 --> 1:55:04.252
Well...

1:55:04.287 --> 1:55:06.089
I called them,
said I'm not coming.

1:55:06.124 --> 1:55:08.223
Uh, you were right.

1:55:08.258 --> 1:55:10.852
Those guys are dicks.

1:55:10.887 --> 1:55:15.395
I don't want to be the fig leaf
covering those dicks.

1:55:17.399 --> 1:55:19.531
Did I go long with that analogy?

1:55:19.566 --> 1:55:21.500
I-I stopped listening
after I heard that I was right.

1:55:23.438 --> 1:55:24.998
It just kind of seems like
you want to say "dicks" a lot.

1:55:25.033 --> 1:55:27.572
Come on, Coach!
Come in the pool!

1:55:27.607 --> 1:55:30.003
-Come on, Coach.
-Oh, come on.

1:55:30.038 --> 1:55:31.510
-Don't be a chicken.

1:55:31.545 --> 1:55:33.006
Come on, Coach.

1:55:33.041 --> 1:55:34.678

1:55:34.713 --> 1:55:36.449
