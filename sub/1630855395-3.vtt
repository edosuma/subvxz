1
00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:18.666
Vespula? Vespula!

2
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:21.166
Are you even listening?

3
00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:24.666
What does Radovid even mean, I see people?

4
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.083
How does he know what I see?
I mean, he's only met me, like, twice.

5
00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:35.166
Nah... You can't play a player.
That's what I always say.

6
00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:39.666
He's hiding something,
and if I'm gonna help Geralt,

7
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.375
I need to find out what that is.

8
00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:47.708
Because Geralt is...

9
00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:50.250
a hammer.

10
00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:52.750
You know?

11
00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:56.625
You're confused.

12
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.958
All right... Wait... Okay. Ah...

13
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.625
When you're a hammer,
every problem is a nail.

14
00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:05.666
You see a nail
and you're like, "Grrr. Fuck this nail."

15
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.500
"Fuck this nail, in particular."
And you hammer the nail.

16
00:01:08.583 --> 00:01:10.333
But sometimes
the problem is something else.

17
00:01:10.416 --> 00:01:14.000
Sometimes the problem is, uh...
a bunch of petunias,

18
00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:18.375
or a bowl of... porridge,
and you can't hammer a bowl of porridge.

19
00:01:19.208 --> 00:01:22.333
I mean, you can try,
but then your hammer gets all gunked up,

20
00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:25.958
porridge goes everywhere,
and then you have... no porridge.

21
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.750
The solution requires

22
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:31.458
a different kind of tool.

23
00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:37.416
And Radovid... is that tool.

24
00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:41.958
Radovid is... a spoon.

25
00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:46.000
- Oh, obviously.
- Obviously. Yeah.

26
00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.666
Aah... Yeah, I'm aware
this doesn't make a lot of sense.

27
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.333
What I'm trying to say is,
the problem is different.

28
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.333
The solution needs to be different.

29
00:01:57.583 --> 00:02:00.833
And Radovid... is different.

30
00:02:03.208 --> 00:02:07.708
He's intelligent.
He tries to hide it, but he's insightful.

31
00:02:08.708 --> 00:02:11.666
Sharp... like a knife.

32
00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:16.250
If he's a knife,
I need to keep him away from Geralt.

33
00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:18.458
You like him!

34
00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:21.125
Who, Geralt? Yeah, I guess.

35
00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:25.958
Platonically, and occasionally with
great effort, as one would a family goat.

36
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:29.125
- Hang on, when did you get dressed?
- I mean the spoon guy.

37
00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:31.166
What, Radovid? No!

38
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.250
- Yes.
- No!

39
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:35.791
I've cursed you
for chasing tail of every kind.

40
00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:37.958
Men, women, dwarves,

41
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:39.750
elves, polymorphous...

42
00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:43.041
That was one time and I... regret nothing.

43
00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:44.333
- It was amazing.
- Hmm.

44
00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:48.041
But never have I ever
seen you have a crush.

45
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:51.166
- A crush?
- Mmm.

46
00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:53.583
Oh, you think I have crushes.

47
00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:54.750
Mmm-hmm.

48
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.208
- Crushes are for children, my darling.
- Mmm?

49
00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:02.458
- I have mind-bending...
- Mmm?

50
00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.958
...world-ending,

51
00:03:05.041 --> 00:03:07.166
heart-wrenching affairs.

52
00:03:10.458 --> 00:03:12.166
Whatever you say.

53
00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:16.208
- The Lothario of Lyria.
- Oh!

54
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.166
- The Romancer of Redania!
- Aah!

55
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.166
The Stud of Cidaris!

56
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.875
Jaskier.

57
00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:25.625
For fuck's...

58
00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:28.958
Sorry. It's the family goat.

59
00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:33.250
Good to see you too.
How'd it go?

60
00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:34.916
Not quite as expected.

61
00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:37.875
Did you find the castle?

62
00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.000
Please tell me you killed Firefingers.

63
00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:42.500
Rience wasn't there.

64
00:03:43.416 --> 00:03:45.416
I did find something else, though.

65
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.166
Yeah, and what's that?

66
00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.500
Her.

67
00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:51.000
And she is?

68
00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:52.583
I don't know.

69
00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:54.666
Ooh, ooh... ooh!

70
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.250
But she thinks she's Ciri.

71
00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:58.541
Always a source. No room for...

72
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.166
I hate you. Ooh!

73
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.250
It's all right... Ciri.

74
00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:05.541
This is a friend.

75
00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:07.416
I'm Jaskier.

76
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.208
Always a source.
No room for vermin.

77
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.333
- Always.
- Fuck. Is she all right?

78
00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:15.291
She was part of an experiment.

79
00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:17.083
- Don't be...
- The only survivor.

80
00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:21.916
She has lucid moments,
but reverts back to this.

81
00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:24.958
Whatever she's rambling about,

82
00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:28.041
it's stuck in her head
in a nonsensical loop.

83
00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:30.250
I need to find out why.

84
00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:32.500
Please tell me you have a plan.

85
00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:35.583
We're taking her to Anika.

86
00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:38.875
If this is an enchantment,
she'll be able to fix it.

87
00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.125
And who's Anika?

88
00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:45.208
She's a druid.
And a friend of my mother's.

89
00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:11.500
Yep, it's him all right.

90
00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:13.791
Smelled you from two hilltops away.

91
00:05:14.458 --> 00:05:16.416
What are you doing here, Otto?

92
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.791
Blame the heightened senses,
but we both know you're a ripe old bugger.

93
00:05:22.333 --> 00:05:24.083
I suppose you're here for a reason.

94
00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:28.583
- Hello, Anika.
- Wait. Just...

95
00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:30.750
She's missed you too.

96
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.250
Come on.

97
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.750
Whew! Oh, that burns.

98
00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:47.750
That burns like a Raróg's arsehole.

99
00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:50.791
- What is it?
- Uh, that's table salt.

100
00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:52.708
Yeah.

101
00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:54.125
Ooh-hoo.

102
00:05:54.208 --> 00:05:56.791
Yep, that's just, uh...
that's just table salt.

103
00:05:56.875 --> 00:05:59.250
That's not, um... not very druidic.

104
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.541
- I'm not a druid.
- Oh, right.

105
00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:02.541
I'm a werewolf.

106
00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:05.041
Whoa. What? You're... What? Uh, a...

107
00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:08.708
I was bit,
back in the plague of '21.

108
00:06:08.791 --> 00:06:12.291
Went out to the woods to isolate.
Avoid the disease.

109
00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:14.958
Was so worried about boils
and shitting myself to death,

110
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.666
I wasn't thinking about werewolves.

111
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.041
Priority, yeah. I get it.

112
00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:20.750
Geralt was hired by the villagers
to kill me.

113
00:06:21.416 --> 00:06:22.833
He found me a cure instead.

114
00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:26.625
- Kept close to my chest, it keeps me safe.
- Oh.

115
00:06:27.416 --> 00:06:29.666
Almost got himself killed
in the process, but...

116
00:06:30.708 --> 00:06:32.250
he saved my life.

117
00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:35.875
Yeah. Seems about right.

118
00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:42.041
I don't know...

119
00:06:43.708 --> 00:06:45.125
How'd you and Otto meet?

120
00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:47.291
It was about a year ago.

121
00:06:49.083 --> 00:06:51.666
We were at the Temple of Truth. Mourning.

122
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.333
His wife, Edwina, was killed in a fire.
The children too.

123
00:06:59.875 --> 00:07:01.166
I was there for Visenna.

124
00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.041
She's dead?

125
00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:13.333
She talked about you a lot at the end.

126
00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:25.541
Well, whoever did this
fucked her up pretty good.

127
00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:27.625
It's a mind-control enchantment.

128
00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:29.833
Mind control?

129
00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:32.125
So someone needs her
to believe she's Ciri.

130
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:34.833
It's extremely powerful.

131
00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:38.125
Elements of Chaos, druidic magic,

132
00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:40.583
even some ancient elven sorcery
in the spell.

133
00:07:41.666 --> 00:07:43.833
Oh, that's another thing.
She's part elven.

134
00:07:43.916 --> 00:07:46.541
Maybe a couple
of generations removed, but still.

135
00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:49.333
Poor girl's head's a tangled mess.

136
00:07:50.333 --> 00:07:52.208
Who would have the power to do this?

137
00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:54.916
I don't know anyone
with the knowledge to do this.

138
00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:58.541
It would take lifetimes
to acquire all these tricks.

139
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.958
Whoever this mage is,
they have quite a variety of interests.

140
00:08:04.458 --> 00:08:06.000
An extraction elixir.

141
00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:09.250
Well done, Otto.

142
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.666
Ah, it'll take a while,
and there's no guarantee.

143
00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.958
If it works, she'll be able
to tell us who did this.

144
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:32.958
And what they want with Ciri.

145
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.916
This is the dwarven bank.

146
00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:49.875
- I thought we were going to Aretuza.
- We are.

147
00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.250
But as you said yourself,
there's always more to the picture.

148
00:08:53.791 --> 00:08:55.958
- Aah!
- My eyes deceive me!

149
00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:59.541
For surely,
a creature this beautiful cannot be real!

150
00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:02.541
My sweet Yennefer,

151
00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:06.583
it is the most sumptuous of pleasures,
as always.

152
00:09:06.666 --> 00:09:09.875
- The pleasure is all mine, Giancardi.
- Mmm!

153
00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.250
Please, take a seat
while we finalize your arrangements.

154
00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:18.458
Horror!
Pure 'orror on my family's faces,

155
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:21.375
as they watched me
dragged away to certain death,

156
00:09:21.458 --> 00:09:23.833
their own fate hanging in the balance.

157
00:09:24.416 --> 00:09:27.541
When who should appear?
A goddess from the heaven?

158
00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:31.666
Better! Yennefer of Vengerberg.

159
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.125
She blasted the villainous wretches
into dust.

160
00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:37.000
You exaggerate my heroism.

161
00:09:37.083 --> 00:09:38.250
Nonsense.

162
00:09:38.333 --> 00:09:41.416
This is why the Giancardi Bank,
mind well the name,

163
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.583
will do anything for a friend.

164
00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:47.625
For your other matter,

165
00:09:47.708 --> 00:09:50.541
my most secure vault is yours.

166
00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:51.625
Thank you.

167
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.416
If it's not too much to ask,
I have one more favor.

168
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.041
- Sure.
- My ward needs a chaperone.

169
00:09:58.125 --> 00:09:59.666
- Say no more.
- What?

170
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.875
Fabio is at your disposal.

171
00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:05.166
I thought you said
this was important for my future.

172
00:10:05.666 --> 00:10:08.500
It is. But first, my past must be settled.

173
00:10:09.583 --> 00:10:12.250
I know you're nervous.
Let me be there with you.

174
00:10:27.625 --> 00:10:28.625
There.

175
00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:30.625
Now you look ordinary.

176
00:10:31.458 --> 00:10:32.750
Stop that.

177
00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:36.333
No one is after you here.
You're just a normal girl having fun.

178
00:10:36.416 --> 00:10:38.750
Take this. Buy something nice.

179
00:10:39.791 --> 00:10:42.875
Now, let me see that talisman
you're constantly fiddling with.

180
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.250
What's that for?

181
00:10:55.916 --> 00:10:57.083
A locator spell.

182
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.416
If you get into any trouble,
hold this tight and recite the chant.

183
00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:04.833
But don't get into any trouble.

184
00:11:19.083 --> 00:11:20.963
Your Highness...

185
00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:23.166
Your Highness, uh...

186
00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:26.333
there seems to be
some confusion among your advisors.

187
00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:28.583
Yes!

188
00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:32.458
- Did you see that?
- Yes, very good.

189
00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:36.500
Whispers of a meeting
with an emissary from Nilfgaard?

190
00:11:36.583 --> 00:11:37.625
Oh, that. Yes.

191
00:11:38.125 --> 00:11:40.041
We brokered a deal.

192
00:11:40.916 --> 00:11:44.041
Quite a good one. In the inevitable event
of their push North,

193
00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:46.500
Nilfgaard has agreed
to leave Redania untouched.

194
00:11:46.583 --> 00:11:49.791
And they're offering
half of Temeria as a vassal state.

195
00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:54.875
Oh, pray tell, my lord, what's the return
on this generous Nilfgaardian investment?

196
00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.916
Oh, nothing we can't afford.

197
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.875
"We"?

198
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:02.958
And, should we find her first, we turn
the Princess of Cintra over to them.

199
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:04.375
You are being conned!

200
00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:10.666
With all due respect, sir,
Nilfgaard are playing you for a fool.

201
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.458
With all due respect, Dijkstra,

202
00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:15.083
you provide the intelligence,
I make the decisions.

203
00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:20.208
Pardon, your Grace...

204
00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:23.625
Queen Hedwig sent me to see

205
00:12:23.708 --> 00:12:27.333
if you're finished with the, uh...
important affairs of state?

206
00:12:27.416 --> 00:12:31.791
She said to tell you they're here.
In case you wanted to say, uh... hello.

207
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:34.375
Oh, yes. Quite finished.

208
00:12:34.458 --> 00:12:36.500
But you've still got two more serves.

209
00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:38.958
It can wait. My sweet Hedwig can't.

210
00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:42.458
Sire, as your most senior advisor,
I cannot stress enough that...

211
00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:44.291
You stress too much.

212
00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:49.333
The only reason you have any power here,
Sigismund, is because of me.

213
00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.166
Don't forget that.

214
00:12:57.458 --> 00:13:00.291
He doesn't take a shit
without me knowing about it.

215
00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:03.208
No one gets a private audience with him
outside my purview.

216
00:13:03.291 --> 00:13:07.083
Radovid told us they did. He was right.
And they're doing it again.

217
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.541
Vizimir's not scheming alone.

218
00:13:10.208 --> 00:13:13.500
Queen Hedwig has been
in such a useful mood of late.

219
00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:16.250
Perhaps it's time
to make her useful to us.

220
00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:17.541
Or should I do it?

221
00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:20.250
No. You have enough fires to fight.

222
00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:21.500
Hmm.

223
00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:24.208
Speaking of fires, annoyingly,
I met another dead end

224
00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:27.416
through that portal in the shape
of an artsy-fartsy crafting studio.

225
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.833
Apparently, Rience is being backed
by someone with appalling taste.

226
00:13:30.916 --> 00:13:35.583
I meant the portal itself.
You said it felt different. More powerful.

227
00:13:36.583 --> 00:13:39.541
Perhaps it's time
to reach out to one of your old community.

228
00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:42.750
- Tissaia might be useful.
- Ooh...

229
00:13:42.833 --> 00:13:46.291
I only mean
that if what the bard says is true,

230
00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:48.708
the witcher is on our scent.

231
00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:51.708
If he gets to Rience first,
we lose the girl.

232
00:13:51.791 --> 00:13:53.250
And our leverage.

233
00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.375
Which is why we must both act now.

234
00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:59.416
You know as well as I do, there are
many ways to persuade the stubborn.

235
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.041
Use Radovid.
Time for him to cut his teeth.

236
00:14:05.208 --> 00:14:06.458
Yes, Dijkstra.

237
00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:08.166
Use me.

238
00:14:09.083 --> 00:14:11.791
Shall I, uh... chat with kitchen hands?

239
00:14:11.875 --> 00:14:14.833
Uh, watch for shady carriages rolling up?

240
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.875
Shadow my brother's wife?

241
00:14:19.041 --> 00:14:22.333
You seem nowhere close
to finding this powerful Princess Cirilla.

242
00:14:22.833 --> 00:14:25.458
You're just so busy
with your royal duties,

243
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:27.208
I dare not split your focus.

244
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.750
I don't need your help.

245
00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:32.750
Well, tell that to your king.

246
00:14:34.166 --> 00:14:35.541
And your boss.

247
00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:47.875
You came.

248
00:14:49.916 --> 00:14:51.208
Strange, isn't it?

249
00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:55.500
Men bleed and kill for this stuff.

250
00:14:57.208 --> 00:14:58.416
Only to let it rust.

251
00:14:59.875 --> 00:15:01.166
In dark rooms.

252
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.750
Because it's worthless.

253
00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:05.291
It's too soft to make anything useful.

254
00:15:05.375 --> 00:15:07.375
You can't eat it. Can't fuck it.

255
00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.208
Though the King of Aedirn
used to like to try.

256
00:15:11.791 --> 00:15:13.875
Its power comes
from believing in its value.

257
00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.250
An illusion designed
to control the masses.

258
00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:20.500
The leader of the Brotherhood
should know all about that.

259
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.291
She seems to know everything else.

260
00:15:24.583 --> 00:15:27.458
You know, it started
to gnaw at me, back in Ellander.

261
00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:30.625
Northerners killing their own.

262
00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.458
The whispers of a dozen bounties
on Cirilla of Cintra.

263
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:38.541
When last everyone knew,
she was killed in the slaughter.

264
00:15:41.125 --> 00:15:43.875
I think you learned Cirilla was alive
and shared the news,

265
00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.250
hoping to curry favor
with the Northern kings.

266
00:15:48.208 --> 00:15:51.583
Except no one can find her.
The Brotherhood is on their shit list,

267
00:15:51.666 --> 00:15:54.500
and they're so focused
on terrorizing an orphan

268
00:15:54.583 --> 00:15:57.583
that they can't see an empire
waiting to destroy them.

269
00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:02.333
Curry favor?

270
00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:04.916
I don't know what's more insulting.

271
00:16:05.625 --> 00:16:08.083
That you think my goals so basic,

272
00:16:08.666 --> 00:16:11.083
or that you free
a Nilfgaardian prisoner of war,

273
00:16:11.166 --> 00:16:12.916
then lecture me on Northern unity.

274
00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:15.625
What mess will you
leave us with this time?

275
00:16:19.208 --> 00:16:20.666
I have been a mess.

276
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And I'm sorry.

277
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.875
When I tried to kill myself at Aretuza,
I was so desperate to control my destiny.

278
00:16:30.916 --> 00:16:33.000
You weren't taking control.
You were losing it.

279
00:16:33.083 --> 00:16:34.083
I know.

280
00:16:34.666 --> 00:16:36.583
And I still feel like that sometimes.

281
00:16:37.875 --> 00:16:39.041
Like I'm at a loss.

282
00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:43.291
Rience. A fire mage.

283
00:16:43.875 --> 00:16:47.291
He's after Cirilla too, but someone
far more powerful is backing him.

284
00:16:47.875 --> 00:16:49.458
We can't let him get to her.

285
00:16:51.791 --> 00:16:56.875
You want me to help hide a princess
whose existence means war?

286
00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.375
I want more than that.

287
00:16:59.875 --> 00:17:01.875
She's extraordinary.

288
00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:05.541
She's the rightful heir to Cintra
and a great deal more, so I'm told.

289
00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:08.041
If war is coming,
there is no hiding her from it.

290
00:17:08.125 --> 00:17:10.416
Well, then, maybe
she can lead us out of it.

291
00:17:11.416 --> 00:17:14.458
For all the Brotherhood's faults,
they respect magic.

292
00:17:15.875 --> 00:17:18.250
She deserves to know
what hers is capable of.

293
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.500
She deserves control of her destiny.

294
00:17:25.166 --> 00:17:26.166
Please.

295
00:17:27.208 --> 00:17:30.166
Please help me make this right. For us.

296
00:17:31.916 --> 00:17:32.916
For her.

297
00:17:35.666 --> 00:17:37.333
After all this time...

298
00:17:39.916 --> 00:17:43.333
After all your searching,
you actually did it.

299
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.541
Did what?

300
00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:49.333
Became a mother.

301
00:17:55.625 --> 00:17:57.125
Smart rates for a smart lady.

302
00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:00.875
- Giancardi Bank, mind well the name.
- Yes, that's four.

303
00:18:01.458 --> 00:18:04.000
- Smart rates for a smart gentleman.
- No thanks, son.

304
00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.625
- Smart rates for a smart lady?
- Oh, piss off.

305
00:18:06.708 --> 00:18:10.250
Smart rates. Come by Giancardi Bank,
mind well the name, to open an account.

306
00:18:10.333 --> 00:18:11.375
Yeah, go on, then.

307
00:18:11.458 --> 00:18:13.083
Smart rates for a smart lady.

308
00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:16.083
Maybe you'd have better luck
if you didn't want it so bad.

309
00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.583
Maybe I'd have better luck

310
00:18:18.666 --> 00:18:21.708
if I wasn't with a girl
who pounds donuts like a truffle pig.

311
00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:24.666
- Want one?
- I'm wheat intolerant.

312
00:18:25.458 --> 00:18:27.625
Come by Giancardi Bank,
mind well the name, sir.

313
00:18:35.083 --> 00:18:36.208
What's that place?

314
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.875
Thanedd Island.

315
00:18:38.833 --> 00:18:42.375
Home to Aretuza.
That's the Tower of the Gull. Tor Lara.

316
00:18:43.458 --> 00:18:44.791
Looks scary, doesn't it?

317
00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:48.958
Legend has it, they take failing novices
to the caves below the tower

318
00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:50.458
and turn them into eels.

319
00:18:55.458 --> 00:18:57.375
Sounds more exciting than this market.

320
00:18:58.625 --> 00:19:02.041
Spectacles here would haunt you to your
deathbed, you rude little duck's arse.

321
00:19:02.125 --> 00:19:03.125
Try me.

322
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.916
♪ All hail Cintra ♪

323
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.833

324
00:19:09.916 --> 00:19:13.166

Nilfgaard!

327
00:19:22.416 --> 00:19:23.708
Anyone give you any trouble?

328
00:19:23.791 --> 00:19:26.416
Please. No one gives a shit
about this ancient elven garbage.

329
00:19:33.333 --> 00:19:35.750
- Where's the book?
- There's no book on monotones.

330
00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.166
- Monoliths.
- Whatever.

331
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.208
There is.
I've been researching for months.

332
00:19:40.291 --> 00:19:43.291
Codringher and Fenn confirmed
it was buried in a Xin'trean cavern.

333
00:19:43.375 --> 00:19:44.875
Where is the book?

334
00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:48.083
If you let me finish, the book of whatever
had already been recovered.

335
00:19:48.166 --> 00:19:51.166
- I assumed it'd been sent to you.
- Why would you assume that?

336
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.083
'Cause it went to Aretuza.

337
00:19:53.666 --> 00:19:55.625
By order of the emperor himself.

338
00:19:56.166 --> 00:19:58.083
You owe me 20 marks, Isturd.

339
00:20:01.458 --> 00:20:02.583
It's Istredd.

340
00:20:03.791 --> 00:20:04.791
Whatever.

341
00:20:06.083 --> 00:20:07.666
All hail the White Flame.

342
00:20:28.083 --> 00:20:31.041
Thought I was gonna shit my kecks
comin' through those gates.

343
00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:34.541
Never seen anything quite like this place.

344
00:20:34.625 --> 00:20:36.083
Well, you just wait.

345
00:20:36.166 --> 00:20:40.208
If the Emperor likes our proposal,
you could be seeing a lot more of it.

346
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.208
My man says
you're from the Scoia'tael front.

347
00:20:44.291 --> 00:20:46.291
What news do you bring, son?

348
00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:47.541
Gallatin, sir.

349
00:20:47.625 --> 00:20:50.000
Bad news. We're getting slaughtered.

350
00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:53.916
Forgive me.
I'm a fighter, not a politician.

351
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.541
I don't really know
how to sugarcoat the truth.

352
00:20:57.125 --> 00:20:58.541
All the better for it.

353
00:20:59.708 --> 00:21:00.833
Continue.

354
00:21:02.416 --> 00:21:04.250
I've been a soldier
all my life.

355
00:21:04.333 --> 00:21:05.958
I take no pleasure in jumping rank.

356
00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:09.541
But Francesca has been siphoning off
our best fighters, our resources,

357
00:21:09.625 --> 00:21:12.958
leading my men on side missions
straight to their graves.

358
00:21:13.041 --> 00:21:16.791
Well, Francesca has made
many sacrifices for her people.

359
00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:19.208
What makes you think
her choices can't be trusted?

360
00:21:19.291 --> 00:21:21.625
Her choices are
in defiance of your orders, sir.

361
00:21:21.708 --> 00:21:25.541
She's not fighting to soften the North.
She's searching for a girl.

362
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:32.750
I'd like you to stay awhile.

363
00:21:33.541 --> 00:21:35.500
We can resolve this issue,
I have no doubt.

364
00:21:36.333 --> 00:21:38.291
- Make sure this man is fed.
- My lord.

365
00:21:40.041 --> 00:21:41.041
Thank you.

366
00:21:50.625 --> 00:21:52.166
Thank you, my lord.

367
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.750
I knew your righteousness would prevail.

368
00:21:54.833 --> 00:21:57.791
Is this a manipulation
to end your punishment?

369
00:21:57.875 --> 00:22:01.250
Because, don't forget, it was deceit
that got you where you are now.

370
00:22:01.333 --> 00:22:02.583
No, my lord.

371
00:22:03.291 --> 00:22:05.000
I would not lie about this.

372
00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:09.125
I asked for a private audience
to protect your secret.

373
00:22:10.166 --> 00:22:12.708
But Cirilla... Cirilla is out there.

374
00:22:17.416 --> 00:22:19.125
I am having dreams about her.

375
00:22:19.625 --> 00:22:22.500
- She wants me to find her.
- You tried that once.

376
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:24.875
You failed.

377
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.083
My lord, I have been in the field.
Gallatin is a good fighter.

378
00:22:29.166 --> 00:22:31.291
He knows the land.
The elves are loyal to him.

379
00:22:31.375 --> 00:22:33.041
He can deliver us the North.

380
00:22:37.666 --> 00:22:40.916
Division among the elves
would only hurt our cause on both fronts.

381
00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:44.625
But, uh...

382
00:22:46.083 --> 00:22:48.875
an army is only as good as its leader, uh...

383
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.250
I know a good leader when I see one.

384
00:22:59.333 --> 00:23:02.666
It gave me... no pleasure to punish you.

385
00:23:05.916 --> 00:23:07.916
But I had to know you could be trusted.

386
00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:12.250
That I had not lost you.

387
00:23:14.791 --> 00:23:16.541
Are you ready to come home, Cahir?

388
00:23:19.625 --> 00:23:20.625
Yes.

389
00:23:28.083 --> 00:23:29.083
Prove it.

390
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:44.166
I think you've chopped
enough wood here for... two,

391
00:23:45.375 --> 00:23:48.166
maybe three centuries of fire.

392
00:23:51.291 --> 00:23:52.708
What's the plan, Geralt?

393
00:23:55.541 --> 00:23:58.166
We wait for her to wake up,
make sure she's okay,

394
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.666
find Rience and the mage that did this,
and kill them.

395
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.000
And then what?

396
00:24:02.625 --> 00:24:06.541
Yarpen told me he saw you
talking to Philippa Eilhart in Ban Gleán.

397
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.583
It's okay, Jaskier.

398
00:24:09.416 --> 00:24:10.958
What did Dijkstra want you to do?

399
00:24:13.208 --> 00:24:16.583
He wanted me to convince you

400
00:24:17.625 --> 00:24:19.125
to take Ciri to Redania.

401
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:21.708
And I agree with him.

402
00:24:23.125 --> 00:24:27.500
She'd be safe with an army,
an entire army at her back.

403
00:24:27.583 --> 00:24:31.250
Ciri would be nothing more
than a brood mare on the Cintran throne.

404
00:24:31.333 --> 00:24:33.250
She's a princess, Geralt.

405
00:24:33.333 --> 00:24:35.083
That's what princesses do.

406
00:24:35.166 --> 00:24:38.458
They sit on little royal thrones
and they have little royal babies.

407
00:24:38.541 --> 00:24:41.625
And they rule kingdoms.
This is what Ciri wants.

408
00:24:41.708 --> 00:24:45.125
Does she want to be a political pawn
for Vizimir and Dijkstra?

409
00:24:45.208 --> 00:24:46.333
- No...
- No.

410
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.333
We stay the course.

411
00:24:48.416 --> 00:24:49.875
Neutrality has consequences too.

412
00:24:49.958 --> 00:24:54.291
There are already consequences, Jaskier.
And not just for Ciri.

413
00:24:55.166 --> 00:24:58.375
I thought by taking her off the board,
the world would stop trying to use her.

414
00:24:59.125 --> 00:25:01.375
Instead, they're trying
to use others in her place.

415
00:25:01.458 --> 00:25:03.000
And they will continue to.

416
00:25:03.083 --> 00:25:07.333
Because that is what people in power do.

417
00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:09.500
But she's not a witcher.

418
00:25:10.291 --> 00:25:16.875
She's certainly not an Aretuzan witch
sourcing magic out of... stones, or hemp,

419
00:25:16.958 --> 00:25:20.166
or plants,
or whatever it is that Yennefer does.

420
00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.041
She's a princess.

421
00:25:23.166 --> 00:25:24.625
I think you should trust her.

422
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.083
Her source.

423
00:25:29.333 --> 00:25:30.583
Her... what now?

424
00:25:33.291 --> 00:25:34.375
You're right.

425
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.666
I'm right...

426
00:25:40.375 --> 00:25:42.916
Well, that's deeply worrying. What?

427
00:25:48.041 --> 00:25:49.041
Geralt...

428
00:25:49.125 --> 00:25:51.250
- I need you to wake up.
- Geralt, no.

429
00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:52.892
- It's too soon.
- Can you hear me?

430
00:25:52.916 --> 00:25:54.596
You could hurt
the extraction spell.

431
00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:57.250
You said there was always a source.

432
00:25:57.333 --> 00:25:59.208
What did you mean?

433
00:26:00.708 --> 00:26:02.208
Always a source to what?

434
00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:04.458
Magic.

435
00:26:05.333 --> 00:26:07.083
Can you tell me your name?

436
00:26:08.291 --> 00:26:09.375
Teryn.

437
00:26:09.916 --> 00:26:11.041
Good.

438
00:26:11.125 --> 00:26:13.291
Something happened
that affected your mind.

439
00:26:15.333 --> 00:26:16.833
Do you remember what happened?

440
00:26:20.666 --> 00:26:22.500
I was dragged from my room.

441
00:26:22.583 --> 00:26:23.583
Yes.

442
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:25.791
By a man.

443
00:26:26.541 --> 00:26:27.541
A man with a scar?

444
00:26:27.625 --> 00:26:28.875
Careful, Geralt.

445
00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:31.958
He was there. Sometimes.

446
00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:37.833
And the woman with the funny voice.

447
00:26:38.833 --> 00:26:40.791
They all helped the man.

448
00:26:41.958 --> 00:26:43.125
The man, he...

449
00:26:45.666 --> 00:26:47.208
He always scared me.

450
00:26:48.333 --> 00:26:49.375
You knew him.

451
00:26:50.333 --> 00:26:51.666
At school.

452
00:26:53.166 --> 00:26:54.541
At Aretuza.

453
00:26:57.791 --> 00:26:59.791
Oh...

454
00:26:59.875 --> 00:27:01.375
We need to put her back under.

455
00:27:01.458 --> 00:27:03.498
- I need a name.
- I'll grab elixir.

456
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:04.833
It's all right.

457
00:27:04.916 --> 00:27:06.708
- Just say it.
- What was his name, Teryn?

458
00:27:16.875 --> 00:27:18.625
Stupid witcher.

459
00:27:18.708 --> 00:27:21.833
You're doomed and you don't even know it.

460
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.041
I am Cirilla's destiny.

461
00:27:25.625 --> 00:27:27.250
May all ye wail,

462
00:27:27.333 --> 00:27:31.041
for the Destroyer of Nations is upon us.

463
00:27:35.833 --> 00:27:37.041
Anika!

464
00:27:42.833 --> 00:27:44.500
Geralt!

465
00:27:44.583 --> 00:27:46.375
Jaskier, the amulet!

466
00:27:47.583 --> 00:27:48.791
No, no, no, no. Teryn. Teryn!

467
00:27:48.875 --> 00:27:50.958
Jaskier!

468
00:27:51.958 --> 00:27:53.333
Geralt!

469
00:27:55.375 --> 00:27:56.791
Ah! Aah...

470
00:27:58.083 --> 00:28:00.541
Shh, shh.

471
00:28:05.875 --> 00:28:07.958
Shh, shh.

472
00:28:13.333 --> 00:28:15.416
Roll up! Roll up!

473
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.250
Roll up!

474
00:28:17.333 --> 00:28:18.791
See with your own eyes

475
00:28:18.875 --> 00:28:22.250
the most frightful creature
the gods ever created!

476
00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:27.208
A live basilisk, the venomous terror
of the Zerrikanian desert!

477
00:28:27.291 --> 00:28:29.750
An insatiable man-eater!

478
00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:31.291
- Only 15 groats.
- Told you.

479
00:28:31.375 --> 00:28:33.666
That's 15 groats, yeah?
Hey, you, hop it.

480
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.708
15 groats, everyone. Yeah, go on.
Pay the money to the boy.

481
00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:38.666
In you go. Enjoy. In you go.

482
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.583
Enjoy the show.
Enjoy the show.

483
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:47.750
Come on, hurry up!

484
00:28:47.791 --> 00:28:51.708
Careful. These beasts
are notoriously unpredictable.

485
00:28:51.791 --> 00:28:53.583
I've fought enough of them to know.

486
00:28:55.541 --> 00:28:57.625
Hey, let's get to the front.

487
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.125
- That cage looks small.
- Maybe it's a baby basilisk.

488
00:29:02.666 --> 00:29:05.708
That would be a rip-off.
How scary could that be?

489
00:29:06.791 --> 00:29:08.083
You'd be surprised.

490
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.458
They are unpredictable.

491
00:29:11.375 --> 00:29:13.333
And unpredictable means trouble.

492
00:29:13.416 --> 00:29:15.250
What's wrong with a little trouble?

493
00:29:15.333 --> 00:29:17.625
A lot if you've lived my life.

494
00:29:19.375 --> 00:29:20.916
That sounds like a challenge.

495
00:29:26.583 --> 00:29:30.958
Ladies and gentlemen!

496
00:29:32.875 --> 00:29:35.333
The king of all serpents.

497
00:29:35.416 --> 00:29:37.833
'Tis a most rare monster.

498
00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:44.000
Hatching from an egg
only laid by a knavish cockerel, well!

499
00:29:44.083 --> 00:29:46.666
Who presents his rump to another...

500
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.041
in the manner of a horny hen!

501
00:29:50.125 --> 00:29:51.750
Ooooh!

502
00:29:51.833 --> 00:29:54.291
Cock-a-doodle-doo-ooh-ooh!

503
00:29:55.916 --> 00:29:57.041
Ta-da!

504
00:29:58.125 --> 00:30:00.166
An egg that must be brooded

505
00:30:00.833 --> 00:30:03.833
by a hundred and one venomous snakes.

506
00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:08.375
Good people, keep your distance.

507
00:30:08.958 --> 00:30:11.416
Its breath alone could poison you.

508
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.083
That's not a basilisk.

509
00:30:14.166 --> 00:30:15.708
Stop interrupting, love.

510
00:30:17.166 --> 00:30:19.458
When the basilisk hatches,

511
00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:22.333
it devours the snakes,
imbibing their venom.

512
00:30:22.416 --> 00:30:25.125
And when a knight stabs it with his sword,

513
00:30:25.208 --> 00:30:27.625
the poison runs up the blade,
killing the knight...

514
00:30:27.708 --> 00:30:29.708
Chhkk, chhkk! Outright.

515
00:30:29.791 --> 00:30:31.250
That is the falsest lie.

516
00:30:31.333 --> 00:30:32.833
'Tis the truest truth.

517
00:30:33.416 --> 00:30:37.250
That's why a basilisk can only be killed
by seeing its reflection in the mirror.

518
00:30:37.333 --> 00:30:38.791
Quite right, sir!

519
00:30:38.875 --> 00:30:41.416
- Don't.
- No, you're all wrong. This is a wyvern.

520
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.208
And it's young, and it's starving
because you're keeping it in this cage!

521
00:30:47.125 --> 00:30:49.583
Listen, darlin',
if you don't like my little show,

522
00:30:49.666 --> 00:30:52.166
why don't you just piss off and shut up?

523
00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:33.208
Oi, oi, you little shit!

524
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.708
This girl is under the protection
of Giancardi Bank.

525
00:31:38.791 --> 00:31:40.500
Mind well the name, arsehole.

526
00:31:48.291 --> 00:31:49.416
Where's my knife?

527
00:31:57.666 --> 00:31:58.666
Here!

528
00:32:04.583 --> 00:32:06.166
Who is she? Is she okay?

529
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:09.625
Get off of her, devil dog!

530
00:32:12.416 --> 00:32:14.250
You saved me, brave knight!

531
00:32:14.333 --> 00:32:16.375
We have a hero in our midst!

532
00:32:16.458 --> 00:32:18.250
- He saved us all!
- I did?

533
00:32:20.041 --> 00:32:22.208
- I did!
- I have to get out of here!

534
00:32:22.291 --> 00:32:25.166
That was fucking incredible!
Did you see me hit that guy?

535
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:27.930
- Yennefer will kill me.
- I'll get fired, I don't even care!

536
00:32:27.958 --> 00:32:29.791
- Where the fuck's my money?
- I can travel.

537
00:32:29.875 --> 00:32:32.355
- Kick arse through this fucking Continent!
- Where's my money?

538
00:32:32.416 --> 00:32:33.934
Hey, trouble!

539
00:32:37.791 --> 00:32:39.208
You were great in there.

540
00:32:41.666 --> 00:32:43.333
Fucking hell.

541
00:32:44.791 --> 00:32:46.375
I've gotta go. Thank you.

542
00:32:47.125 --> 00:32:49.708
- Where are you goin'?
- And good luck kicking arse!

543
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.208
Where are you, Yennefer?

544
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.333
Another runaway.
You've had your fun, novice.

545
00:33:14.416 --> 00:33:16.375
- Back to the dorms.
- Get your hands off me!

546
00:33:18.041 --> 00:33:20.333
You will address me
as Mistress Laux-Antille.

547
00:33:20.416 --> 00:33:22.833
And you'll clean the toilets
for your impertinence.

548
00:33:22.916 --> 00:33:24.276
I'll take it from here.

549
00:33:24.333 --> 00:33:25.833
Yen.

550
00:33:25.916 --> 00:33:27.750
What are you doing here?

551
00:33:29.166 --> 00:33:31.291
Bringing my ward
to get a proper education,

552
00:33:31.375 --> 00:33:33.333
one she obviously sorely needs.

553
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.083
Forgive her, Rita.

554
00:33:40.208 --> 00:33:41.500
So this is the girl.

555
00:33:45.625 --> 00:33:46.708
Don't look at her.

556
00:33:49.333 --> 00:33:50.333
Look at me.

557
00:33:53.833 --> 00:33:56.208
Don't you dare take your eyes off me.

558
00:34:04.166 --> 00:34:06.646
That's enough introductions.

559
00:34:07.166 --> 00:34:11.583
As an apology for her impudence, allow me
to treat you ladies to some luxury.

560
00:34:12.166 --> 00:34:13.541
Thank gods, I'm bored.

561
00:34:13.625 --> 00:34:15.833
Shall we take the waters
at the Silver Heron?

562
00:34:16.916 --> 00:34:19.041
Don't threaten me with a good time.

563
00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:31.416
Hands off. He's mine.

564
00:34:33.833 --> 00:34:36.416
I wasn't planning
on using my hands.

565
00:34:41.666 --> 00:34:44.000
Fuck magic, let's stay here.

566
00:34:48.375 --> 00:34:52.208
If this place ever closes,
I'll burn this fucking city to the ground.

567
00:34:53.291 --> 00:34:54.291
Here, girl!

568
00:34:56.875 --> 00:34:58.708
Novices these days are useless.

569
00:34:58.791 --> 00:35:01.250
- Mmm.
- Not like when we were girls.

570
00:35:02.958 --> 00:35:04.500
I told you to bring the wine.

571
00:35:04.583 --> 00:35:07.083
I'm surprised you can taste anything
at this point.

572
00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:09.166
Are you calling me a lush?

573
00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:11.541
Better a lush than a traitor.

574
00:35:13.875 --> 00:35:15.166
Tell me, Yennefer.

575
00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.416
Are the rumors about witchers true?

576
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.166
That their mutations make them impotent?

577
00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:24.625
- You're fucking a witcher?
- Atrocious, isn't it?

578
00:35:25.416 --> 00:35:28.041
- Almost as atrocious as your manners.
- Mmm.

579
00:35:28.125 --> 00:35:29.625
Ooh.

580
00:35:29.708 --> 00:35:33.791
Perhaps instead of dwelling on the past,
focus our attention on the future.

581
00:35:34.791 --> 00:35:36.333
I wanted red!

582
00:35:36.416 --> 00:35:37.541
Here.

583
00:35:38.291 --> 00:35:39.416
We deserve a drink.

584
00:35:39.916 --> 00:35:42.875
After all the fires
we've been putting out between kingdoms.

585
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.916
Fires we didn't start.

586
00:35:48.416 --> 00:35:50.416
Damned Cintran princess.

587
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.125
- What's so special about her, anyway?
- Mmm.

588
00:35:55.333 --> 00:35:57.375
Girl, the wine! Now.

589
00:35:58.416 --> 00:35:59.416
Get it yourself.

590
00:36:05.958 --> 00:36:07.333
She'll only screw it up.

591
00:36:07.416 --> 00:36:10.041
Besides, I know where the good stuff is.

592
00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:18.750
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Shut the fuck up.

593
00:36:18.833 --> 00:36:22.458
- Before you spoil everything.
- I can't spoil something already rotten!

594
00:36:22.541 --> 00:36:24.958
This place, these women, it's horrible!

595
00:36:25.041 --> 00:36:27.625
"This place"? You're not a princess here.

596
00:36:28.208 --> 00:36:30.750
You're a low-level novice.
Get used to being treated like one.

597
00:36:30.833 --> 00:36:32.875
Entitlement will get you nowhere.

598
00:36:32.958 --> 00:36:35.375
I don't want to do this.

599
00:36:35.958 --> 00:36:37.598
You know, I don't want to do this either.

600
00:36:38.208 --> 00:36:40.666
Tomorrow I'll be expected
to crawl back to the Brotherhood,

601
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:43.125
tail between my legs,
begging for forgiveness.

602
00:36:43.208 --> 00:36:44.500
And I'll do it.

603
00:36:44.583 --> 00:36:48.625
Because Aretuza is my best hope
of protecting you from those who hunt you.

604
00:36:48.708 --> 00:36:50.958
Our best chance to be safe.

605
00:36:51.916 --> 00:36:54.541
- You have to go along to get along.
- To what end?

606
00:36:55.208 --> 00:36:59.208
If I can't learn to control my powers,
will you let Tissaia turn me into an eel?

607
00:36:59.291 --> 00:37:02.291
And if I do become
some powerful, learned Aretuzan maid,

608
00:37:02.375 --> 00:37:04.125
will you let her scrape out my insides

609
00:37:04.208 --> 00:37:07.083
to become vapid and power-hungry
like your friends out there?

610
00:37:07.166 --> 00:37:10.500
Tissaia is one of the most
powerful sorceresses on this Continent!

611
00:37:10.583 --> 00:37:13.041
You should be grateful
she's willing to teach you!

612
00:37:17.166 --> 00:37:19.041
Just because she saved you

613
00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.875
does not mean
you owe her the rest of your life.

614
00:37:24.416 --> 00:37:26.750
You told me
to never apologize for my power,

615
00:37:26.833 --> 00:37:29.166
and yet that's all you seem to do.

616
00:37:30.041 --> 00:37:33.666
You want to be a great leader?
You want to change the world?

617
00:37:34.208 --> 00:37:35.791
Well, the day-to-day of leading

618
00:37:35.875 --> 00:37:38.583
is dealing with a lot of vapid,
power-hungry arseholes!

619
00:37:43.125 --> 00:37:44.291
I'm not Geralt.

620
00:37:45.416 --> 00:37:46.791
This isn't Kaer Morhen.

621
00:37:47.916 --> 00:37:50.333
This is the version of myself
I have to be here.

622
00:37:50.916 --> 00:37:54.166
So you need to find a version of yourself
that can deal with that.

623
00:37:54.666 --> 00:37:56.500
Trust me, I know you're not Geralt.

624
00:37:57.291 --> 00:37:59.791
He would never sell his soul like this.

625
00:38:21.791 --> 00:38:23.208
It's all right.

626
00:38:25.791 --> 00:38:27.166
Thanks to Otto.

627
00:38:28.791 --> 00:38:31.125
I've never seen
someone make a potion so fast.

628
00:38:32.208 --> 00:38:33.333
You taught him well.

629
00:38:34.791 --> 00:38:36.750
Just like Visenna taught me.

630
00:38:43.041 --> 00:38:44.375
Did she suffer?

631
00:38:47.125 --> 00:38:49.791
She was mistaken for an elf
while helping a villager.

632
00:38:52.583 --> 00:38:54.208
She was beaten very badly.

633
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.250
Does that make you feel better or worse?

634
00:39:01.583 --> 00:39:03.083
I never wanted her to hurt.

635
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:09.000
- Just wanted her to know what she did.
- Oh, she knew.

636
00:39:09.666 --> 00:39:13.583
Love for a child forces parents to make
the hardest choices of their lives.

637
00:39:14.708 --> 00:39:16.083
Impossible ones, even.

638
00:39:18.083 --> 00:39:21.166
Chances are, they toil over it
for the rest of their lives.

639
00:39:30.708 --> 00:39:32.625
I do remember bits of our life.

640
00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:39.041
She smelled like embers.

641
00:39:40.375 --> 00:39:44.458
From keeping those measly fires alive
for the long nights.

642
00:39:47.916 --> 00:39:49.375
I remember my hunger.

643
00:39:50.666 --> 00:39:53.125
And her stomach growling
twice as loud as mine.

644
00:39:55.791 --> 00:39:57.083
She used her magic

645
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.291
to create elaborate meals
that we couldn't afford.

646
00:40:07.958 --> 00:40:10.208
I would have done anything
to make her smile.

647
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:14.375
And yet...

648
00:40:16.916 --> 00:40:18.208
the day she left me,

649
00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:20.291
she was sick.

650
00:40:23.875 --> 00:40:26.125
She needed water,
so I went to get her some.

651
00:40:26.625 --> 00:40:28.000
And when I came back...

652
00:40:30.541 --> 00:40:31.666
she was gone.

653
00:40:34.083 --> 00:40:35.375
I called for her.

654
00:40:39.458 --> 00:40:40.458
But she was gone.

655
00:40:42.041 --> 00:40:43.833
She loved you the best she could.

656
00:40:45.958 --> 00:40:48.208
To save you, she had to let you go.

657
00:40:50.458 --> 00:40:53.541
- This can't have been the only choice.
- It wasn't.

658
00:40:55.125 --> 00:40:56.625
It's simply the one she made.

659
00:40:57.875 --> 00:41:00.416
And now you have
your own impossible decision.

660
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.250
I won't abandon Ciri.

661
00:41:03.625 --> 00:41:05.458
Even if it costs me my life.

662
00:41:11.041 --> 00:41:12.041
Teryn.

663
00:41:14.458 --> 00:41:17.541
Can she stay here,
while I work out how to help her?

664
00:41:17.625 --> 00:41:20.208
- Mmm, of course.
- Thank you.

665
00:41:21.333 --> 00:41:22.458
Where are you going?

666
00:41:25.041 --> 00:41:26.958
Aretuza.

667
00:41:38.458 --> 00:41:39.666
Are you all right?

668
00:41:40.958 --> 00:41:42.166
No.

669
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:46.750
The magic is one thing.

670
00:41:48.125 --> 00:41:49.833
- But the politics...
- Hmm.

671
00:41:50.958 --> 00:41:53.875
Even if I can curry enough favor to get
back into the Brotherhood's fold

672
00:41:53.958 --> 00:41:55.666
and get her trained, you're right.

673
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.041
War is coming,
and she's at the center of it.

674
00:41:59.458 --> 00:42:02.083
Mages have kept kings in check
for centuries.

675
00:42:04.208 --> 00:42:07.541
- We'll find a way.
- Toxicity's infectious.

676
00:42:09.333 --> 00:42:13.750
The kings have turned against each other.
How long before mages follow suit?

677
00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.916
If we are to unite the North,
we must be united.

678
00:42:21.666 --> 00:42:22.875
A conclave.

679
00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:25.041
What?

680
00:42:26.416 --> 00:42:28.333
We host a conclave of mages.

681
00:42:29.958 --> 00:42:33.291
- We haven't had one since before Sodden.
- And then we went to war.

682
00:42:33.375 --> 00:42:35.166
So we do it differently this time.

683
00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:40.000
Instead of discord and debate,
we focus on trust.

684
00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:41.958
Togetherness.

685
00:42:47.375 --> 00:42:49.166
Is this also the girl's doing?

686
00:42:49.791 --> 00:42:52.875
If we have any hope
of appealing to the kings,

687
00:42:53.958 --> 00:42:56.541
we first have to find
better versions of ourselves.

688
00:42:59.708 --> 00:43:00.916
I'm willing to try.

689
00:43:02.583 --> 00:43:03.583
Are you?

690
00:43:23.291 --> 00:43:24.291
Geralt.

691
00:43:24.958 --> 00:43:26.375
Hey, Geralt, where are you?

692
00:43:26.458 --> 00:43:28.958
Geralt, where are you?

693
00:43:29.041 --> 00:43:30.681
Who's Geralt?

694
00:43:30.708 --> 00:43:32.291
Where are you?

695
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.625
He's coming. Now.

696
00:43:36.708 --> 00:43:38.416
We'll meet again soon.

697
00:43:40.833 --> 00:43:43.750
I understand your concerns.
But I've made up my mind.

698
00:43:43.833 --> 00:43:46.208
This Cirilla nonsense is
too much of a headache.

699
00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:48.916
I couldn't agree more, Your Majesty.

700
00:43:49.791 --> 00:43:52.375
But bargaining with Nilfgaard
is not the answer.

701
00:43:53.166 --> 00:43:56.625
- The queen is opinionated and strong.
- Like a bull.

702
00:43:56.708 --> 00:44:00.375
And Radovid is eager to please.
But all three of you are far too important

703
00:44:00.458 --> 00:44:03.708
to burden yourself with the minutiae
of Redanian intelligence.

704
00:44:04.541 --> 00:44:05.708
What would you suggest?

705
00:44:06.583 --> 00:44:10.583
Hope I'm not interrupting.
Uh, this was left with my manservant.

706
00:44:11.791 --> 00:44:13.750
- The note says it's for you.
- Oh.

707
00:44:14.541 --> 00:44:16.333
A present.

708
00:44:20.583 --> 00:44:23.000
"Courtesy of Nilfgaard."
See, I told you, Dijkstra.

709
00:44:23.083 --> 00:44:24.375
They're not so ba...

710
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.250
I want men on every door and window.
Nobody in or out but me!

711
00:44:37.333 --> 00:44:39.541
Tell the gatekeeper
to scout the perimeter.

712
00:44:39.625 --> 00:44:41.833
Bring me
Radovid's manservant immediately!

713
00:44:41.916 --> 00:44:44.000
With me! Now!

714
00:44:44.583 --> 00:44:46.500
Man on every door! We've got intruders!

715
00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:50.666
I swear to you,
I will not let them get away with this.

716
00:44:51.166 --> 00:44:52.886
Guard the gates!

717
00:44:52.958 --> 00:44:54.798
- Come. Come.
- Secure the perimeter!

718
00:44:55.875 --> 00:44:57.791
- Through that gate!
- By me!

719
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:00.750
- Through there, now!
- Come.

720
00:45:01.333 --> 00:45:03.333
- Take the king to his chambers.
- My lord.

721
00:45:17.166 --> 00:45:18.208
Hmm.

722
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.166
Mmm. Hah!

723
00:45:27.625 --> 00:45:28.625
You.

724
00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:33.791
All that talk of...
making the queen more useful.

725
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:36.333
You and Philippa did this.

726
00:45:38.791 --> 00:45:40.166
You won't get away with it.

727
00:45:40.666 --> 00:45:41.541
Huh.

728
00:45:41.625 --> 00:45:42.916
It's treason.

729
00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:47.208
- I'll tell my brother.
- Tell him what, exactly?

730
00:45:48.791 --> 00:45:52.083
That his strong, opinionated queen,
gods rest her soul,

731
00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:54.333
went a little rogue
in the secret meetings,

732
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.666
and deserved to be assassinated?

733
00:45:58.166 --> 00:45:59.333
On your watch?

734
00:46:00.333 --> 00:46:01.833
- He trusted you.
- Trusts.

735
00:46:05.125 --> 00:46:06.208
He trusts me.

736
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:08.875
Now more than ever.

737
00:46:10.333 --> 00:46:12.333
I am his most important advisor.

738
00:46:12.833 --> 00:46:17.625
Whereas you are
a weak, silly, ineffectual little shit

739
00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:20.416
who just delivered his wife's head
to him in a box.

740
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:23.583
Well, now I come to think of it,

741
00:46:23.666 --> 00:46:26.333
how do we know
you weren't involved in her treachery?

742
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.625
You want to help?
Go back to sucking on the royal teat

743
00:46:32.708 --> 00:46:36.041
until you're just drunk enough
to forget this terrible tragedy.

744
00:46:36.875 --> 00:46:38.791
And keep your mouth shut.

745
00:46:40.833 --> 00:46:43.833
Because next time,
it could be your head in a box.

746
00:47:23.458 --> 00:47:24.541
Breathe.

747
00:47:26.541 --> 00:47:27.541
Breathe.

748
00:47:45.458 --> 00:47:46.500
Mmm.

749
00:47:50.708 --> 00:47:51.791
Enough.

750
00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:59.333
Aah!

751
00:48:00.666 --> 00:48:02.666
Oh, I wish you were there today.

752
00:48:03.916 --> 00:48:05.916
I mean, I knew Hedwig had a thick neck,

753
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.708
but gods, that was a workout
to cut through.

754
00:48:10.166 --> 00:48:11.250
Mmm.

755
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:16.708
I wonder what Dijkstra thought
of my pièce de résistance.

756
00:48:16.791 --> 00:48:18.000
Mmm.

757
00:48:18.083 --> 00:48:20.375
No one ever expects
a head in a box, do they?

758
00:48:22.041 --> 00:48:24.083
- It doesn't make any sense.
- Hmm?

759
00:48:24.166 --> 00:48:27.416
Emhyr uses mages
for cannon fodder, not emissaries.

760
00:48:29.208 --> 00:48:31.916
The woman you saw in the meeting
didn't move her mouth.

761
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.541
Oh, well, it takes all sorts,
I suppose.

762
00:48:35.875 --> 00:48:37.833
Unless she was using telepathy.

763
00:48:39.666 --> 00:48:40.666
Hmm.

764
00:48:41.708 --> 00:48:43.708
But how did she manage
to portal into the palace

765
00:48:43.791 --> 00:48:46.333
and through my protection enchantments?

766
00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:49.708
Maybe because the portal was special?

767
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:53.916
A portal is a portal.

768
00:48:55.625 --> 00:48:56.875
I've seen your portals.

769
00:48:58.666 --> 00:49:01.166
This wasn't that.

770
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:06.333
This was a swirling black vortex
of fucking unnervingness.

771
00:49:09.541 --> 00:49:11.750
The mage backing Rience...

772
00:49:13.708 --> 00:49:15.208
works for Nilfgaard.

773
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:18.666
Fuck me.

774
00:49:22.208 --> 00:49:25.291
The only reason
I fucking agreed to do this job

775
00:49:25.375 --> 00:49:28.500
is because you told me
you didn't work for Nilfgaard.

776
00:49:28.583 --> 00:49:30.666
I don't. I work for my lord.

777
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:33.000
Who works for fucking Nilfgaard!

778
00:49:33.083 --> 00:49:36.958
Oh, Rience, don't get so agitated.
It makes you uglier.

779
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:42.541
As for my lord, working with Nilfgaard
is not the same as working for Nilfgaard.

780
00:49:42.625 --> 00:49:45.500
The White Flame is just a means to an end.

781
00:49:45.583 --> 00:49:47.791
A small piece of a much bigger puzzle.

782
00:49:48.666 --> 00:49:51.208
Don't worry your hideous little face.

783
00:49:52.125 --> 00:49:53.958
At least I still have a face.

784
00:49:55.791 --> 00:49:58.083
Instead of just the illusion of one.

785
00:50:00.125 --> 00:50:03.916
Tell him I'm growing tired
of being kept in the dark.

786
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.708
If he wants me
to go along with his little plan,

787
00:50:08.541 --> 00:50:10.166
I have a demand of my own.

788
00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:31.583
Hey.

789
00:50:33.125 --> 00:50:36.166
You... are exhausted.

790
00:50:36.958 --> 00:50:39.416
- You need to eat.
- Not until they do.

791
00:50:41.666 --> 00:50:42.875
What news from the scouts?

792
00:50:42.958 --> 00:50:46.791
There was a rumor that she was spotted
in Maribor. Nothing came of it.

793
00:50:48.708 --> 00:50:49.833
And Gallatin?

794
00:50:49.916 --> 00:50:53.333
He's headed to Xin'trea
with the roundy general.

795
00:50:54.291 --> 00:50:56.875
So perhaps it would be wise to consider

796
00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.000
an escape plan.

797
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.041
The only escape I'll take
is death, Filavandrel.

798
00:51:08.708 --> 00:51:13.458
I don't miss the snobbery of the city,
but shit, I do miss the services.

799
00:51:13.541 --> 00:51:16.166
Your White Flame
sure knows how to host.

800
00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:17.875
Well...

801
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.791
I suppose it's not hard

802
00:51:19.875 --> 00:51:22.333
to impress a backwards pointy
like you, though, is it?

803
00:51:22.416 --> 00:51:25.000
I'd rather be a backwards pointy
invited to the palace

804
00:51:25.083 --> 00:51:27.791
than the rich little shit
who got kicked out of it.

805
00:51:27.875 --> 00:51:31.833
That's not fair. I lost my money
long before I was kicked out.

806
00:51:34.208 --> 00:51:36.125
My father was the nobleman.

807
00:51:37.291 --> 00:51:41.458
He expected me to have a disposition
of a diplomat like my brothers.

808
00:51:42.083 --> 00:51:45.250
But I was impetuous.
Short temper, rash judgment.

809
00:51:45.333 --> 00:51:48.083
- That's why I like fighting.
- You? No.

810
00:51:48.875 --> 00:51:53.500
Well, if we've moved onto the emotional
story-swapping part of our friendship,

811
00:51:54.083 --> 00:51:56.125
I think we'd have got on as kids.

812
00:51:56.208 --> 00:51:59.791
We may have burned down a town
or two on accident, but... still.

813
00:52:06.208 --> 00:52:10.541
When the Usurper took Nilfgaard,
he enslaved my father and my brothers.

814
00:52:11.208 --> 00:52:15.125
He was afraid of their strength and their
ability to someday take revenge, but...

815
00:52:15.958 --> 00:52:16.958
but I was...

816
00:52:17.958 --> 00:52:19.958
I was just a little boy, I was...

817
00:52:20.958 --> 00:52:22.500
too weak for concern.

818
00:52:22.583 --> 00:52:24.375
I was left to starve or die.

819
00:52:24.458 --> 00:52:27.416
Cahir, I've known you to march into battle

820
00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:31.666
with little more than a breastplate made
of chicken bones and a stick for a sword.

821
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:34.666
Fuck the Usurper. He was an idiot.

822
00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:38.375
That's what the White Flame said to me
when he came to free me.

823
00:52:39.583 --> 00:52:42.083
"The Usurper was a fool
to let you go, son,

824
00:52:42.583 --> 00:52:44.708
because you are the strongest
of them all."

825
00:52:44.791 --> 00:52:47.166
Well, I suppose you're strong
for a scrawny little...

826
00:53:04.458 --> 00:53:05.458
I'm sorry.

827
00:53:06.041 --> 00:53:08.500
I'm sorry it had to be this way.

828
00:54:22.708 --> 00:54:24.125
Ciri...

829
00:54:35.083 --> 00:54:37.125
Cirilla!

830
00:54:37.625 --> 00:54:40.083
Cirilla!

831
00:54:43.291 --> 00:54:44.642
Cirilla!

832
00:54:44.666 --> 00:54:47.416
Cirilla!

833
00:54:52.125 --> 00:54:54.375
No. You're ghosts. Corpses.

834
00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:59.791
Yes, we are corpses,
but you are death itself!

835
00:55:05.875 --> 00:55:07.625
Join us.

836
00:55:26.583 --> 00:55:27.875
You found me.

837
00:55:55.708 --> 00:55:56.833
They were real.
