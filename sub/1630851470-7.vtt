00:53.375 --> 00:54.916
Hello?

00:54.958 --> 00:56.375
Is there anyone out here?

01:01.750 --> 01:03.875
Where am I?

01:05.125 --> 01:09.583
I-I don't know where I am or who I am.

01:09.625 --> 01:12.583
-You are an outsider. -

01:13.958 --> 01:16.000
Who's there?

01:19.708 --> 01:21.708
Who are you talking to?

01:21.750 --> 01:23.333
How can you talk?

01:23.375 --> 01:28.125
Well, the tigers of my tribe are simply wiser than most.

01:28.166 --> 01:30.250
Wh-where are your claws?

01:30.291 --> 01:32.708
Hmm?

01:32.750 --> 01:35.250
Rest assured, I can still hunt,

01:35.291 --> 01:37.083
no matter what anyone says.

01:40.291 --> 01:42.500
I was going to eat the navit I had been tracking.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.791
And I still will!

01:48.833 --> 01:51.833
But for now, let's get you back to your tribe.

01:51.875 --> 01:53.708
From where do you hail?

01:53.750 --> 01:56.625
All I can remember is my name.

01:56.666 --> 01:59.000
My name is Adam.

01:59.041 --> 02:01.416
And I want to go home.

02:05.625 --> 02:10.000
Your home will be with me until we find the tribe you truly belong to.

02:10.041 --> 02:11.250
Come on, then.

02:14.291 --> 02:16.833
Whoa!

02:16.875 --> 02:19.125
Whoa. Whoa!

02:22.250 --> 02:24.791
You're going to have to learn to hold on.

02:27.875 --> 02:31.125
I still wish we could have parked the Wind Raider a little closer.

02:31.166 --> 02:33.166
Oh, yeah.

02:33.208 --> 02:36.041
"Sorry we showed up in the transport that tried to burn down the village.

02:36.083 --> 02:41.208
Prince Adam didn't want to waste his precious energy."

02:41.250 --> 02:45.666
Besides, you want to deny Cringer the chance to play with his new claws?

02:45.708 --> 02:47.458
Wouldn't dream of it.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.833
And I'm glad we have some time to check back in with the tribe

02:49.875 --> 02:52.916
while Teela finally figures out where Keldor's hiding.

02:59.166 --> 03:01.125
What's wrong? Smell something?

03:01.166 --> 03:06.041
I suppose this part of the jungle just brings back some bad memories.

03:12.041 --> 03:14.833
Let the hunt begin.

03:15.791 --> 03:18.416
I have the Power!

04:09.375 --> 04:12.125
Where are you, Keldor?

04:13.750 --> 04:15.500
Fascinat--

04:18.041 --> 04:20.250
Orko, I'm trying to concentrate.

04:20.291 --> 04:22.000
Ooh, pardon me, Teela.

04:22.041 --> 04:24.833
I forget lesser magicians are easily distracted.

04:24.875 --> 04:26.833
By all means, please continue.

04:30.916 --> 04:32.625
That's it.

04:36.208 --> 04:37.625
I've almost got you.

04:37.666 --> 04:39.333
Oh, I see!

04:39.375 --> 04:41.833
You're using the Havoc energy stored in the fibia to--

04:43.875 --> 04:45.666
Trouble concentrating?

04:45.708 --> 04:48.166
Allow me to perform an ancient Trollan meditation chant

04:48.208 --> 04:50.125
guaranteed to develop focus.

05:00.041 --> 05:01.916
Okay, where did I put it?

05:01.958 --> 05:03.583
-Hey. -Ow.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.750
I thought you said you fixed him.

05:05.791 --> 05:09.250
Oh, Orko found his way over to you, huh?

05:09.291 --> 05:10.875
What fantastic magic!

05:10.916 --> 05:13.500
Uh, Orko, p-please, be careful.

05:13.541 --> 05:15.666
Those sky sleds are pretty delicately configured, so--

05:15.708 --> 05:17.333
That simply won't do.

05:17.375 --> 05:20.541
I have just the levitation spell to firm things up a bit.

05:22.083 --> 05:24.833
Let me just make a few wizardly adjustments.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.166
There we go.

05:29.166 --> 05:31.875
It's a handy-dandy redecorating spell too.

05:34.958 --> 05:37.583
Oh, I got it. I got it. Uh, stand aside for magic.

05:37.625 --> 05:40.625
Okay, look, I tried removing the Trollan Data Cog,

05:40.666 --> 05:43.041
but I can't do it without permanently deactivating him.

05:43.083 --> 05:46.250
-And, I don't know, that just feels-- -Cruel?

05:46.291 --> 05:49.458
Like I feel every time I explain he's not actually a Trollan wizard?

05:49.500 --> 05:51.833
Make way, Trollan wizard coming through!

05:51.875 --> 05:53.291
Not that he listens.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.791
Well, he thinks he's Trollan, right?

05:55.833 --> 05:57.750
Why don't we just take him to Trolla?

05:57.791 --> 06:00.750
Yeah, but isn't that even more cruel?

06:00.791 --> 06:02.500
-Whoa!

06:04.958 --> 06:06.750
Um...

06:06.791 --> 06:08.166
Road trip.

06:09.375 --> 06:10.791
Yeah!

06:12.208 --> 06:14.875
That stretch of jungle was our best time yet.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.541
I mean, I still won.

06:16.583 --> 06:19.458
What? I was way ahead of you over that ravine.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.333
And still couldn't beat me. Ha!

06:21.375 --> 06:24.541
Quarry will soon know what it is to lose.

06:24.583 --> 06:26.750
Poacher bots shouldn't be this close to tribal land.

06:26.791 --> 06:29.458
Quarry states the obvious.

06:33.333 --> 06:36.500
How's about we just end the battle before it really starts?

06:36.541 --> 06:38.958
By the Power of--agh!

06:39.000 --> 06:41.916
By the Power of--agh!

06:41.958 --> 06:43.916
I'm trying to do a thing!

06:46.125 --> 06:48.541
Be right back.

06:48.583 --> 06:50.208
That sword is too important to lose!

06:50.250 --> 06:51.541
And we aren't?

06:51.583 --> 06:54.375
You can totally handle a few bots!

06:54.416 --> 06:55.833
Go help Adam.

06:55.875 --> 06:59.000
I can handle these Beastopoid brutes on my own.

07:09.166 --> 07:12.250
You know, my whole purpose in life is not just to follow you around.

07:12.291 --> 07:14.208
I never said it was.

07:14.250 --> 07:15.750
No, you just expect it.

07:15.791 --> 07:19.625
Here I am again leaving a member of the tribe unprotected

07:19.666 --> 07:21.708
to help you chase your destiny.

07:21.750 --> 07:24.416
Don't be jealous just because I have a destiny.

07:28.458 --> 07:31.000
Wow.

07:31.041 --> 07:32.791
I didn't mean that.

07:32.833 --> 07:34.125
Look, I don't want to fight, Krass.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.458
Yeah? Well, maybe I do.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.666
Maybe that's my destiny or whatever.

07:38.708 --> 07:39.875
Shh.

07:42.750 --> 07:45.333
Are you shushing me now too?

07:51.416 --> 07:53.500
Why didn't any bots follow us down here?

07:53.541 --> 07:57.375
They were programmed by Beastopoids. What do you expect?

07:57.416 --> 08:00.458
Let's just get the sword and get back to Cringer.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.291
This Beastopoid might be smarter than the rest.

08:10.833 --> 08:12.708
Or not.

08:12.750 --> 08:16.541
It's been a long time since R'Qazz spoke with humans.

08:16.583 --> 08:19.916
Sometimes he forgets himself.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.416
Oh, that's not creepy at all.

08:22.375 --> 08:24.208
With you out of the way,

08:24.250 --> 08:28.125
R'Qazz can finish what he started with your feline friend.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.958
--Stay away from Cringer!

08:33.375 --> 08:39.125
Don't worry, Cringer and R'Qazz are old friends.

08:39.166 --> 08:41.666
Are those Cringer's claws?

08:43.500 --> 08:48.208
The price to be paid for refusing to fight in R'Qazz's pit.

08:57.416 --> 09:02.500
Perhaps R'Qazz will finish what he started with your shiny instead.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.500
Leave Cringer alone!

09:07.125 --> 09:08.791
We gotta get out of here.

09:12.666 --> 09:14.625
Better check on the cubs.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.041
Prowler, is that you?

09:21.125 --> 09:22.875
Katura?

09:22.916 --> 09:24.541
Bash?

09:27.916 --> 09:29.958
What did he do to you?

09:58.333 --> 10:00.791
Tear him to shreds!

10:06.583 --> 10:09.041
Why have you brought me here?

10:09.083 --> 10:11.541
We wanted to escort you back to your people.

10:11.583 --> 10:15.000
This is apparently the last place they were seen.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.000
Welcome to Trolla.

10:17.041 --> 10:19.958
Or back to Trolla, I guess.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.750
There's your statue.

10:22.791 --> 10:27.208
Mm, and I'm sure everything else is... nearby?

10:28.541 --> 10:30.291
That is atrocious.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.291
It looks almost nothing like me.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Well, I'm glad to see I'm not the only one

10:44.041 --> 10:46.708
who thinks the sculptor hath defiled my great countenance.

10:46.750 --> 10:47.958
We're too late.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.250
This is a communication totem...

10:50.291 --> 10:52.708
for any Trollans left behind.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.500
Left behind? From where?

10:54.541 --> 10:56.541
Another dimension.

10:56.583 --> 11:00.500
Apparently the real--realer-- Orko the Great helped his people ascend.

11:00.541 --> 11:05.541
Ah, clearly I then returned to help less enlightened individuals

11:05.583 --> 11:07.333
follow the same path.

11:07.375 --> 11:12.750
But that time has passed, for now I return to my people!

11:16.500 --> 11:19.083
Hold on.

11:21.541 --> 11:24.458
Pardon me, that was-- that was not supposed to happen.

11:28.083 --> 11:31.541
Orko, uh, that isn't gonna work.

11:31.583 --> 11:34.750
It--it has to work!

11:34.791 --> 11:39.375
Because I am Orko the Great!

11:46.541 --> 11:47.666
Ah!

11:47.708 --> 11:50.375
What sorcery is this?

11:51.750 --> 11:54.083
-Orko. -

11:56.958 --> 11:58.458
That went well.

12:04.416 --> 12:05.875
This...

12:05.916 --> 12:07.375
...would be...

12:07.416 --> 12:10.000
...much easier as...

12:10.041 --> 12:12.500
...He-Man.

12:12.541 --> 12:16.166
None of this would have happened if it weren't for that stupid sword.

12:16.208 --> 12:19.666
Without that stupid sword, you wouldn't be Ram Ma'am,

12:19.708 --> 12:21.541
and I think you kind of like being Rammy.

12:21.583 --> 12:24.125
Don't say what I do and don't like.

12:25.791 --> 12:27.791
I'm a complicated Stripe.

12:27.833 --> 12:30.541
So is Cringer.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.583
Why didn't he tell us that was how he lost his claws?

12:38.458 --> 12:40.041
You can ask him when we save him.

12:41.750 --> 12:42.875
Tiger Tribe together?

12:49.750 --> 12:51.125
Hold on, Cringer.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.791
Please be safe, cubs.

13:21.833 --> 13:24.958
They can't hear you, Cringer.

13:28.750 --> 13:32.041
But R'Qazz can.

13:35.708 --> 13:38.208
Let my cubs go! They're not part of this!

13:38.250 --> 13:42.416
R'Qazz's jungle, R'Qazz's rules.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.958
I have new claws now.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.916
You can't frighten me anymore.

13:58.958 --> 14:00.750
I could in the pit.

14:00.791 --> 14:03.625
It's why R'Qazz named you Cringer.

14:03.666 --> 14:07.083
R'Qazz wonders why you kept it, though.

14:07.125 --> 14:09.416
There's no shame in refusing to fight.

14:09.458 --> 14:12.875
And I'd rather be called Cringer over Killer any day.

14:12.916 --> 14:18.791
Ah, the friends you abandoned to escape feel differently.

14:30.291 --> 14:31.833
Good.

14:31.875 --> 14:34.541
You will give R'Qazz the fight he is owed.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.875
Please, I don't want to fight them.

14:36.916 --> 14:38.666
You don't have a choice.

14:38.708 --> 14:40.583
There's always a choice!

14:49.625 --> 14:53.458
Then R'Qazz chooses to fight the coward's cubs instead.

14:56.875 --> 14:59.500
-You recognize these tigers? -Before my time with the tribe.

15:01.125 --> 15:04.125
But that doesn't mean we all can't be friends, right?

15:05.500 --> 15:09.000
You have the power to stop this, Cringer.

15:10.916 --> 15:13.041
Ah, give me my thing.

15:15.250 --> 15:17.250
Where are your claws?

15:23.500 --> 15:25.333
I do have power.

15:28.416 --> 15:31.041
The Power of Grayskull!

15:31.083 --> 15:33.333
R'Qazz has a bad feeling about this.

15:50.625 --> 15:54.000
I have the Power!

15:57.333 --> 16:00.041
We can transform on our own?

16:11.458 --> 16:13.375
Tiger Tribe together.

16:13.416 --> 16:16.041
By the Power of Grayskull...

16:39.541 --> 16:42.375
-...I have the Power!

16:48.083 --> 16:49.958
-Get the runt. -

16:51.458 --> 16:52.666
Just try it.

16:56.250 --> 16:58.583
It's our turn to help. You get the weird guy.

16:58.625 --> 16:59.916
We'll handle the tigers.

16:59.958 --> 17:01.750
Please, don't hurt them.

17:10.250 --> 17:12.208
Here, kitty, kitty.

17:12.250 --> 17:13.791
Whoa!

17:17.291 --> 17:19.666
I can handle myself.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.041
Hurry up, Battle Cat.

17:34.541 --> 17:36.916
You can't control me.

17:36.958 --> 17:39.833
Can't blame R'Qazz for trying.

17:42.833 --> 17:44.125
Let's wrap this up.

17:45.041 --> 17:47.416
Anytime now, Battle Cat!

17:50.666 --> 17:52.416
Agh!

18:08.416 --> 18:09.875
Enough!

18:12.125 --> 18:14.000
Blade Wheels!

18:22.125 --> 18:24.791
Don't be the animals he wants you to be.

18:24.833 --> 18:27.291
Be the beasts you choose to be.

18:27.333 --> 18:30.041
Cringer, is that you?

18:30.083 --> 18:33.458
I'm sorry this happened to you, my friends.

18:41.083 --> 18:43.541
-You okay? -No.

18:43.583 --> 18:47.291
I damaged all that remains of Trolla.

18:47.333 --> 18:48.666
I can fix it.

18:48.708 --> 18:52.208
Of course you can, with your real magic.

18:52.250 --> 18:54.708
Unlike my... my...

18:54.750 --> 18:56.916
Security bot tool suite?

18:59.541 --> 19:03.875
But I'm not a security bot or a wizard.

19:03.916 --> 19:07.041
I-I don't belong anywhere.

19:08.125 --> 19:09.833
None of us do.

19:12.791 --> 19:15.416
That's why we belong together.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.541
I can help you learn to be a better wizard.

19:17.583 --> 19:19.916
And I'll help you be a better machine.

19:19.958 --> 19:22.875
Stay at Grayskull... with us.

19:22.916 --> 19:25.000
Then with your help,

19:25.041 --> 19:31.333
I will honor all that Orko the Great has left within me as just Ork-O.

19:31.375 --> 19:33.541
Ork-Zero?

19:33.583 --> 19:34.916
Ork-O.

19:34.958 --> 19:36.083
Orko.

19:36.125 --> 19:37.666
We can figure it out on the way.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.291
Let's go home.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.833
The castle's the other way!

19:40.875 --> 19:43.125
The castle is the other way.

19:44.041 --> 19:45.750
--They're back.

19:49.291 --> 19:50.750
-Is it really you? -

19:50.791 --> 19:53.083
So did you know you could become Battle Cat

19:53.125 --> 19:54.958
without Adam leading the charge?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.541
No.

19:56.583 --> 19:59.333
I suppose in the moment, I felt the Power of Grayskull

19:59.375 --> 20:02.000
flowing into me through my new claws.

20:02.041 --> 20:05.208
The sword channels the power into your weapons, I guess.

20:05.250 --> 20:08.083
-But a Master can use it whenever... -...or however...

20:08.125 --> 20:09.583
-...he... -...or she...

20:09.625 --> 20:10.791
...wants.

20:15.583 --> 20:17.708
A lot's happened since we left.

20:17.750 --> 20:21.208
There's no guarantee R'Qazz or any other poachers

20:21.250 --> 20:23.000
won't keep coming.

20:23.041 --> 20:26.666
Destiny or not, Adam, you are part of this tribe.

20:26.708 --> 20:29.541
We should stay and protect the village.

20:30.458 --> 20:31.666
I can't.

20:32.875 --> 20:34.708
Keldor is still on the loose.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.333
I'm He-Man now.

20:36.375 --> 20:40.291
It's my duty to protect everyone, not just the jungle.

20:40.916 --> 20:42.458
I see.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.333
Come on, Cringer.

20:44.375 --> 20:46.750
I told Adam I'd protect him until he was reunited with his family.

20:46.791 --> 20:48.291
A promise is a promise.

20:48.333 --> 20:52.291
Fine! Ram Ma'am will protect the village.

20:52.333 --> 20:55.333
I don't need He-Man to transform anyway, right?

21:13.333 --> 21:15.916
-Are you holding on? -Always.

21:29.416 --> 21:32.916
My employer was impressed by your near victory over the children.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.333
Skeletor wants to offer you a job,

21:35.375 --> 21:37.833
one that will most assuredly give you an upper hand

21:37.875 --> 21:41.041
the next time you face the brats.

21:41.083 --> 21:43.541
Are you in or not?
