<i> I love you.</i>

00:06.065 --> 00:08.632
<i> I love both of you.</i>

00:11.253 --> 00:12.827

00:16.684 --> 00:18.408
<i> -...need to go to the police.</i>
-(knocking)

00:18.427 --> 00:20.244
-BUCK: Chim, come on.
<i> -Jee is not safe...</i>

00:20.262 --> 00:21.854
-Chim, I know you're home--
I can hear you.
<i> -Better...</i>

00:22.005 --> 00:24.081
<i> -Better off without me.</i>
-(door opens)

00:24.099 --> 00:26.025
<i> ...really good care of her,</i>

00:26.252 --> 00:27.509
<i> -and she...</i>
-(taps keys)

00:27.528 --> 00:29.511
<i> You don't need to go</i>

00:29.530 --> 00:30.937
-(taps keys)
<i> -...any danger,</i>

00:31.032 --> 00:32.606
<i> -and no one is making me...</i>
-(taps keys)

00:32.700 --> 00:35.275
<i> ...need to go to the police</i>
<i> or come looking for me.</i>

00:35.427 --> 00:36.976
-Chimney?
<i> -...come looking for me.</i>

00:37.038 --> 00:38.537
-(tapping keys)
<i> -...come looking for me.</i>

00:38.764 --> 00:40.097
-Chimney?
-What is it, Buck?

00:40.115 --> 00:42.282
<i> -Nobody's making me do this.</i>
-What are you doing?

00:42.434 --> 00:43.876
-(taps keys)
<i> -...need to go to the...</i>

00:44.027 --> 00:45.527
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm trying

00:45.546 --> 00:47.104
to figure out
what happened to your sister.

00:47.197 --> 00:48.714
Nothing happened to her, Chim.

00:48.865 --> 00:50.440
-She just left.
-That's it?

00:50.534 --> 00:53.594
She just left?
And that makes sense to you?

00:54.797 --> 00:57.890
Listen, sometimes Maddie, um...

00:58.117 --> 00:59.283
she likes to put distance

00:59.376 --> 01:01.543
between herself
and her problems.

01:01.637 --> 01:03.729
So what's the problem
in this instance--

01:03.880 --> 01:06.214
is it me or is it her daughter?

01:06.308 --> 01:08.567
You know what her problem is
'cause she told you.

01:08.718 --> 01:11.219
She-she felt like Jee
wasn't safe with her right now.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.480
Here, let me show you something.

01:13.632 --> 01:15.966
-(taps key)
<i> -...or come looking for me.</i>

01:15.984 --> 01:18.318
<i> I'm not in any danger</i>
<i> and no one</i>

01:18.412 --> 01:19.653
<i> -is making me do this.</i>
-(taps key)

01:19.805 --> 01:22.397
Did you see that?
Did you see that, right there?

01:22.491 --> 01:23.898
See what?

01:24.067 --> 01:26.159
She shakes her head as she's
looking right into the camera.

01:26.312 --> 01:27.494
It's like she's telling me

01:27.588 --> 01:29.479
to believe the opposite
of what she's saying,

01:29.498 --> 01:32.382
almost like-like there's someone
making her do it.

01:38.915 --> 01:40.874
That sounds crazy, doesn't it?

01:41.026 --> 01:42.542
-No.
-It does, and I know it does.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.494
But I just-I just need to know.
I just...

01:44.513 --> 01:46.179
I need to make sure
there's no one out there

01:46.273 --> 01:47.606
-that's trying to hurt her.
-No. No,

01:47.757 --> 01:51.360
Chimney, Chimney,
no one wants to hurt Maddie.

01:53.021 --> 01:54.095
Doug did.

01:54.189 --> 01:55.188
Doug is dead.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.615
Is he, though?

01:56.766 --> 01:59.042
I mean, did you see a body?
Did anybody see a body?

01:59.044 --> 02:00.193
Come on.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.437
The day after
Maddie disappeared,

02:02.531 --> 02:04.014
she withdrew $20,000

02:04.032 --> 02:05.866
out of a settlement account
from a bank in Oxnard.

02:06.018 --> 02:08.109
Doesn't it sound like maybe
somebody's trying to coerce her?

02:08.129 --> 02:10.203
-No.
-That money came
from Doug's estate.

02:10.297 --> 02:13.373
You know he would have
considered it his.

02:14.135 --> 02:18.137
Do you really believe anything
you're saying right now?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.960
I really don't want
to hate her, Buck.

02:26.722 --> 02:29.873
I don't want to believe
that she could do this to us,

02:29.892 --> 02:32.151
to me, to Jee-Yun.

02:32.378 --> 02:34.486
Just got to give her time.

02:34.713 --> 02:36.971
She's gonna come home.

02:36.991 --> 02:39.366
How do you know that?

02:40.068 --> 02:41.976
'Cause I know my sister.

02:42.070 --> 02:45.313
Yeah, well, I did, too.
Now I'm not so sure,

02:45.332 --> 02:46.648
which is why I have
to keep going back to this.

02:46.742 --> 02:49.001
This is the only thing
that she left me with.

02:49.228 --> 02:51.003
(Jee-Yun cries)

02:51.897 --> 02:54.080
(sighs)

02:54.233 --> 02:57.918
Not the only thing.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.429
Jee, I'm coming.

03:04.259 --> 03:06.977
-(soft, indistinct chatter)
-(phone rings in distance)

03:07.930 --> 03:09.262
(door opens)

03:10.191 --> 03:12.340
ROSALIE:
Okay, everyone switch places.

03:12.434 --> 03:14.193
Harry, I'm gonna talk
to your mom and dad a bit,

03:14.420 --> 03:15.752
and then
I'll give them right back.

03:15.845 --> 03:17.587
You okay out here for a second?

03:17.681 --> 03:21.015
-Can I have my phone?
-Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

03:21.109 --> 03:22.034
Be right back, okay?

03:22.185 --> 03:23.685
(door closes)

03:23.704 --> 03:25.019
<i> So, how's he doing?</i>

03:25.113 --> 03:27.188
Has he said anything
about what happened yet?

03:27.208 --> 03:29.541
We're still building a rapport.
How's he been at home?

03:29.693 --> 03:31.376
Uh, it's hard to tell.

03:31.528 --> 03:33.620
Uh, he hasn't
opened up there, either.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.440
Oh, he barely looks at me
when I come over to see him.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.275
He still hasn't been back
to the house yet?

03:38.368 --> 03:41.461
No. After the... kidnapping,

03:41.613 --> 03:43.722
he wanted to stay
at Michael's place,

03:43.873 --> 03:46.116
which, of course,
was understandable.

03:46.134 --> 03:49.135
Like you said,
these things take time.

03:49.288 --> 03:51.788
Mm-hmm. In general, yes,
but in this case,

03:51.881 --> 03:54.215
I would encourage you
to bring him back to the house

03:54.309 --> 03:55.792
sooner rather than later.

03:55.811 --> 03:57.143
Even if he doesn't
want to be there?

03:57.296 --> 04:00.072
Allowing him to stay away
is telling him

04:00.299 --> 04:02.466
that you agree
the house is scary.

04:02.559 --> 04:03.967
Instead, what we want to say is

04:04.060 --> 04:07.246
that the man who took him is
scary, and that man is gone.

04:07.397 --> 04:10.249
It's important to signal to him
that the world

04:10.476 --> 04:12.066
he's always known is still safe.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.419
How do we do that?

04:14.646 --> 04:16.146
You know, bring him back
to the house?

04:16.239 --> 04:17.905
Uh, should you be there?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.775
You should make it
as normal as possible.

04:19.777 --> 04:21.167
If Harry picks up
on your anxiety,

04:21.320 --> 04:23.095
then he'll be more anxious, too.

04:23.322 --> 04:25.822
-All right, we'll...
-We'll think about it.

04:25.841 --> 04:28.433
<i> JOSH:</i>
<i> Can you believe it?</i>

04:28.585 --> 04:31.511
The prodigal daughter
has returned.

04:31.663 --> 04:33.105
She's back? Really?

04:33.256 --> 04:34.273
I thought that was just a rumor.

04:34.424 --> 04:35.590
JOSH:
She walked in those doors

04:35.609 --> 04:38.168
and immediately took over
a priority one.

04:38.261 --> 04:40.337

-Suspect is still in the house.
-JOSH: She used to work here

04:47.788 --> 04:48.862
years ago until she was poached
by Valley,

04:49.014 --> 04:50.347
but I lured her back.

04:50.365 --> 04:52.182
Homeowner is in the rear
bedroom and non-responsive.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.517
Once I give the all-clear,

04:53.610 --> 04:55.127
you've got French doors
off the back.

04:55.278 --> 04:57.537
<i> MAN: Copy. 133 is standing by.</i>

04:57.631 --> 04:58.946
Home invasion robbery.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.690
The homeowner and his grandson
managed to hide,

05:00.784 --> 05:02.709
but it sounds like Granddad's
having a heart attack.

05:02.861 --> 05:06.046
Lonnie, the paramedics
are real close, I promise,

05:06.140 --> 05:07.714
but they can't enter
the house yet.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.458
-Do you still hear the intruder?
<i> -Yes, yes, I can hear him.</i>

05:10.477 --> 05:12.719
-And what about your grandpa?
Is he breathing?
<i> -No, no.</i>

05:12.871 --> 05:14.629
<i>-He's dying. I think he's dying.</i>
-Okay, honey.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.631
-You've got your earbuds in,
right?
<i> -Yes, yes.</i>

05:16.725 --> 05:18.375
Good. You're gonna need
both your hands. I'm gonna

05:18.393 --> 05:20.652
-talk you through
doing compressions.
<i> -No, no, I-I can't.</i>

05:20.879 --> 05:22.546
<i> -They're gonna hear.</i>
-You can. You can do this.

05:22.639 --> 05:24.898
Put one hand on top of the other
and press the heel

05:24.992 --> 05:27.400
of your palm against the center
of your grandpa's chest.

05:27.553 --> 05:29.310
<i> -Okay.</i>
-Now, keep your elbows locked.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.996
You're gonna push hard
as you can.

05:31.147 --> 05:33.390
You want to see his chest
go down, over and over.

05:33.408 --> 05:35.167
Don't call out.
I'll get you started. You just

05:35.394 --> 05:39.004
huff and puff on my count.
And don't stop till I tell you.

05:39.155 --> 05:40.564
-Ready?
<i> -Yeah.</i>

05:40.657 --> 05:42.732
One, two. One, two.

05:42.826 --> 05:46.494
One, one. One, one. Two, two.

05:46.588 --> 05:50.331
Good, good. Keep pushing,
Lonnie. You're doing great.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.092
Five-Adam-19,

05:52.186 --> 05:53.910

-It's gonna be loud.
<i>-LONNIE: I can hear them coming.</i>

-Good.

06:03.346 --> 06:05.438
<i> I think he's coming closer.</i>

<i> -LONNIE: I'm here.</i>

-You did real good.
Yeah, you did real good.
<i> -Thank you.</i>

06:43.962 --> 06:47.030
That's all right, honey.
You're welcome.

06:47.966 --> 06:50.242
(whooping)

06:51.078 --> 06:54.729
Okay. All right. A little...
a little oxygen, please.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.140
Come on. Come on.
Social distance, please.

06:57.159 --> 06:59.809
Thank you. Here you go. (laughs)

06:59.828 --> 07:01.569
Wow. That was really something.

07:01.663 --> 07:03.329
Just doing my job.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.573
Guess they put you
right back to work.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.575
Didn't even give you time
to put on your uniform.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.128
-(Claudette exclaims)
-Oh. (short chuckle)
Claudette doesn't

07:10.280 --> 07:11.245
-wear the polo.
-Mm-mmm.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.764
-Oh. She doesn't?
-No.

07:12.916 --> 07:15.508
BOTH: Does it look like I'm
FaceTiming with these people?

07:15.661 --> 07:16.601
(both laughing)

07:16.828 --> 07:19.212
CLAUDETTE:
Can't believe you remember that.

07:19.364 --> 07:21.014
Seriously, though,
I couldn't look this corny

07:21.166 --> 07:22.832
and do what I do.

07:22.851 --> 07:25.335
I'm just talking about
the shirt, so no offense.

07:25.353 --> 07:28.280
-Hi, Claudette.
-Linda Bates?

07:28.431 --> 07:30.674
I did not expect to see you.

07:30.767 --> 07:33.510
I had ten bucks
you'd wash out in six months.

07:33.528 --> 07:34.861
-Which you still owe me.
-Whatever.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.846
-It's good to see you.
-You, too.

07:36.865 --> 07:38.105
And I don't mind
losing ten bucks.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.367
-Which you still owe me.
-Okay.

07:41.462 --> 07:43.036
-(Josh laughs)
-Everyone seems really excited

07:43.188 --> 07:45.297
to have you here.
May Grant.

07:45.524 --> 07:47.632
You may grant me what?
That coffee?

07:47.784 --> 07:50.877
What? Oh, no. It's-it's my name.
Unless you want it.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.363
Yeah. This is a latte?

07:53.381 --> 07:56.123
-Uh, yeah.
-Yeah, this'll work.
Josh, I like

07:56.218 --> 07:57.309
your interns.
They come prepared.

07:57.536 --> 07:59.811
-Oh, I'm not an intern.
-May's been

08:00.038 --> 08:01.146
a dispatcher for almost a year.

08:01.373 --> 08:05.725
Oh. So we're hiring fetuses now?

08:05.877 --> 08:07.377
(both laugh)

08:07.395 --> 08:09.303
CLAUDETTE: Is there nutmeg
in the breakroom?

08:09.323 --> 08:10.989
-Cinnamon, I think.
-Ugh.

08:11.140 --> 08:12.565
It's a good thing I'm back.

08:12.718 --> 08:13.900

Buck, how much longer
until you get him out?

18:59.864 --> 19:01.864
BUCK:
Almost there, Cap.

19:02.867 --> 19:06.144
-Okay. Good to go!
-BOBBY: Okay, guys,
let's get him out of there.

19:06.295 --> 19:08.146
One, two, three. Up.

19:08.297 --> 19:11.374
Nice and easy.
All the way up.

19:11.467 --> 19:12.633
Gently now.

19:12.652 --> 19:16.045
All right, Hugh.
After this, you're gonna have

19:16.063 --> 19:18.047
a pretty interesting
science class to teach,

19:18.065 --> 19:20.216
and I'm guessing,
some pretty attentive students.

19:20.234 --> 19:21.993
HUGH:
Thank you.

19:24.222 --> 19:26.414
RAVI:
Fire's contained, Cap.

19:29.060 --> 19:30.393
<i> MICHAEL:</i>
<i> Harry,</i>

19:30.486 --> 19:32.819
did you tell your mother
where these tomatoes came from?

19:32.914 --> 19:35.089
Hmm.

19:37.826 --> 19:39.343
The roof garden.

19:39.570 --> 19:42.496
Harry helped Ms. Wallace
plant these a few months ago.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.831
-Hmm.
-Literally the fruits
of your labor.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.518
-Do you like 'em?
-They're all right.

19:50.097 --> 19:53.357
-Can I be excused?
I have homework.
-Yeah, sure.

20:00.107 --> 20:02.015
(door closes)

20:02.035 --> 20:03.201
I need a drink.

20:03.428 --> 20:05.094
-(chuckles softly)
-You want one?

20:05.112 --> 20:08.614
So much for not sharing
our anxiety with him.

20:08.766 --> 20:10.041
Worst parents ever,

20:10.268 --> 20:12.101
or just honorable mention?

20:12.119 --> 20:13.711
We got him back in one piece.

20:15.364 --> 20:16.631
Yeah.

20:18.701 --> 20:21.368
Look, we have
been through plenty before.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.554
We'll figure this one out, too.

20:23.706 --> 20:25.514
Yeah.

20:31.714 --> 20:33.213
Uh, uh, Dr. Green, excuse me?

20:33.233 --> 20:35.900
Um, the front desk told me
who you were. I apologize.

20:36.051 --> 20:38.811
I'm Howard Han,
and this is Jee-Yun,

20:38.963 --> 20:40.312
who I think
you may know already.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.074
-Uh, I'm her father.
-What can I do for you, Mr. Han?

20:43.301 --> 20:45.818
I received this form in the mail
from my health insurance,

20:45.912 --> 20:47.411
and I was just hoping
that you could explain it to me.

20:47.638 --> 20:49.563
All right, if you have
any billing questions, you...

20:49.582 --> 20:51.474
No, no, it's-it's not
a billing question. Uh, uh,

20:51.492 --> 20:54.477
it says right here that
my daughter was brought in

20:54.495 --> 20:56.979
for an ER visit,
and-and that you treated her.

20:57.039 --> 20:59.239
Yes.
How is she?

20:59.333 --> 21:02.318
Uh, the baby is fine,
but her mother is not.

21:02.336 --> 21:04.745
Uh, I'm kind of losing it here.

21:04.839 --> 21:07.673
I-I-I... I just need to know
what happened to her.

21:07.825 --> 21:09.600
I think maybe you should speak
to Jee-Yun's mother about this.

21:09.752 --> 21:11.585
No, no, no, I-I can't speak
to Maddie about it

21:11.604 --> 21:14.013
because the day after she
brought Jee-Yun in to see you,

21:14.165 --> 21:16.999
she left, and I-I don't know
where she is.

21:17.018 --> 21:19.184
Please. Um...

21:19.337 --> 21:21.504
She left me a message saying

21:21.522 --> 21:23.597
that the baby
wasn't safe with her.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.283
Which, if you knew her,
that's just...

21:25.434 --> 21:27.192
it's crazy
because she's a great mother.

21:27.287 --> 21:30.454
She just doesn't know it yet.

21:30.606 --> 21:33.349
Or she doesn't believe it,
I guess. Uh...

21:34.109 --> 21:37.128
You see, she-she...
she has postpartum,

21:37.279 --> 21:39.188
and it's been
really tough on her.

21:39.206 --> 21:41.190
And I know that she's tired.

21:41.208 --> 21:43.301
I mean, we both are, but, uh,

21:43.452 --> 21:45.528
she's had to do most of it
alone.

21:45.546 --> 21:49.307
You see, uh, the day that
she brought Jee-Yun to see you--

21:49.534 --> 21:51.309
that's the week
that the world went crazy,

21:51.460 --> 21:53.202
more than usual.

21:53.220 --> 21:55.962
Uh, see, I'm a firefighter, and

21:56.057 --> 21:58.374
I was on call
the whole time, so, uh,

21:58.392 --> 22:02.302
I didn't get to go home,
and, uh...

22:02.322 --> 22:06.231
I really didn't check on her
a lot. I tried.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.809
I tried a lot,
but the power was out,

22:08.828 --> 22:10.569
and the phones were down
half the time.

22:10.663 --> 22:14.373
And there was a giraffe on
Hollywood Boulevard. (laughs)

22:17.319 --> 22:18.819
I'm-I'm so sorry.

22:18.838 --> 22:22.581
I'm-I'm not crazy. I'm-I'm just
completely in the dark here,

22:22.733 --> 22:25.492
and I just need to know
what's going on with her.

22:25.586 --> 22:28.087
(sighs) With the both of them.
That's all.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.348
(sniffles, sighs)

22:30.499 --> 22:32.725
Please?

22:34.595 --> 22:37.763
Evidently, Ms. Buckley
was bathing your daughter,

22:37.915 --> 22:39.857
and Jee-Yun slipped
under the water.

22:40.768 --> 22:43.510
-Well, f-for how long?
-Probably a few seconds.

22:43.637 --> 22:45.863
But Ms. Buckley couldn't
be sure, which is why

22:46.014 --> 22:48.366
she brought Jee-Yun in
to be examined.

22:48.517 --> 22:49.850
Just to be safe.

22:49.944 --> 22:51.810
Yeah, that's right.

22:51.962 --> 22:53.371
(sighs)

22:53.522 --> 22:56.281
I-I'm so sorry. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

22:56.434 --> 22:59.085
-Best of luck to you.
-Thank you.

23:00.863 --> 23:02.505
(sighs)

23:15.561 --> 23:17.210
Can I talk to you a second?

23:17.230 --> 23:20.046
Of course.
What's up?

23:20.066 --> 23:23.025
So... Claudette.

23:25.630 --> 23:27.220
Claudette...

23:27.240 --> 23:29.073
You've known her
for a while, right?

23:29.300 --> 23:31.300
Yeah, we came up together.

23:32.060 --> 23:35.304
-Has she said anything to you?
-About what?

23:35.322 --> 23:37.564
-About me.
-No. Why?

23:37.583 --> 23:40.567
It seems like
maybe I've done something

23:40.661 --> 23:42.253
to rub her the wrong way?

23:42.404 --> 23:44.313
-What do you mean?
-It just feels like

23:44.331 --> 23:47.073
ever since she got here,
she's had it in for me.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.168
-Ever since she got here?
-Yeah.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.820
You mean since... this morning?

23:51.839 --> 23:53.580
Has it really only been a day?

23:53.674 --> 23:56.767
Not even a full a day.
May,

23:56.919 --> 23:58.661
-what's going on?
-I don't know.

23:58.754 --> 24:01.939
I mean, I know
she's a legend or whatever,

24:02.166 --> 24:03.691
and everybody loves her.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.111
But I think she hates me.

24:07.262 --> 24:09.188
May, you're imagining things.

24:09.282 --> 24:13.342
Am I? She took over one of my
calls and kind of snapped at me.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.510
I'm sure it wasn't personal.

24:14.528 --> 24:15.694
Sure felt personal.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.288
Look...

24:17.515 --> 24:19.290
Claudette's a big personality.

24:19.517 --> 24:22.108
But she's got
an even bigger heart.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.836
Have you tried talking to her?

24:24.021 --> 24:25.204
I think
that would be a bad idea.

24:25.298 --> 24:26.705
-Do you want me to talk to her?
-No, no.

24:26.857 --> 24:29.041
Then it just looks like
I'm running to the boss.

24:29.193 --> 24:30.301
Might just make things worse.

24:30.452 --> 24:31.802
Uh, it would
for sure make it worse

24:32.029 --> 24:33.862
if Claudette heard
she had a boss.

24:33.881 --> 24:35.881
-I'm kidding. My advice?
-(scoffs softly)

24:36.033 --> 24:37.641
Talk to her,
just tell her how you feel.

24:37.793 --> 24:40.886
I'm sure there's just
a misunderstanding, and

24:41.038 --> 24:42.521
the two of you can work it out.

24:48.637 --> 24:50.713
-(phone ringing)
-(indistinct chatter)

24:50.806 --> 24:53.115
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

25:05.563 --> 25:08.005
-Not my favorite day.
-(scoffs) Yeah.

25:08.232 --> 25:10.508
-This one was brutal.
-Yeah.

25:10.659 --> 25:13.252
You did great out there.

25:13.346 --> 25:16.013
War zones are my thing.

25:16.164 --> 25:18.015
Excuse me.
Henrietta Wilson?

25:18.242 --> 25:20.834
We're Makayla Tannor's parents--
the cheerleader who was injured?

25:20.928 --> 25:23.412
-Makayla. Of course.
-We just wanted

25:23.505 --> 25:26.172
to say thank you for s-saving
our daughter's life.

25:26.192 --> 25:29.418
I assure you,
it-it wasn't just me. It was...

25:29.436 --> 25:31.920
Thank you.

25:31.939 --> 25:35.274
Thank you for giving us back
our little girl.

25:35.426 --> 25:37.092
Of course.

25:37.111 --> 25:38.927
You're welcome.

25:39.021 --> 25:41.263
Did you guys know the other
girl that was riding with her?

25:41.356 --> 25:44.767
Cassie. The girls have been best
friends since they were little.

25:44.785 --> 25:48.771
Cassie spent as much time
at our house as Makayla did.

25:48.864 --> 25:51.364
Oh, God.
How are we gonna tell her?

25:51.458 --> 25:54.385
-It's gonna be okay, baby.
-(crying)

25:58.315 --> 26:01.283
-(crying)
-(mutters)

26:01.285 --> 26:02.951
-ELLEN: Oh, God.
-JACK: Cassie's parents.

26:02.970 --> 26:06.713
-Lynn and Tommy.
-Ellen.

26:06.807 --> 26:09.692
Jack. (crying)

26:12.387 --> 26:15.147
This can't be happening, can it?

26:15.299 --> 26:16.815
ELLEN:
No. No, it can't.

26:16.967 --> 26:19.910
-It's a nightmare.
-LYNN: They said
our baby is here.

26:20.062 --> 26:22.137
Have you seen her?
Have you seen Cassie?

26:22.156 --> 26:23.488
ELLEN:
No.

26:23.641 --> 26:26.475
They said we have to...
identify her.

26:26.493 --> 26:28.493
Would you like me
to help you find you a nurse?

26:28.646 --> 26:30.813
Yeah. Yeah.

26:30.873 --> 26:32.497
Is that her blood?

26:32.650 --> 26:34.758
Is that our baby's blood?

26:34.910 --> 26:36.594
-(crying)
-Did she say anything?

26:37.838 --> 26:41.414
Sh... She was gone when we
got on the scene. I'm sorry.

26:41.434 --> 26:45.327
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

26:45.346 --> 26:47.921
-(crying)
-We should have been there.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.441
We're never there.

26:52.002 --> 26:55.003
-We missed her whole life.
-LYNN: I want to see my baby.

26:55.097 --> 26:57.005
I want to see her.

26:57.024 --> 26:59.283
Why isn't anyone helping us?

26:59.434 --> 27:01.193
Why don't you let me show you
where she is?

27:01.287 --> 27:03.495
-I can take you.
-Okay.

27:11.538 --> 27:14.381
Oh, my, God.
Makayla?

27:15.209 --> 27:17.551
She's in recovery.

27:20.547 --> 27:22.014
Thank you, Lord.

27:40.067 --> 27:41.659
(Lynn cries)

27:43.053 --> 27:45.412
(Lynn cries loudly)

27:50.060 --> 27:52.411
Oh. (gasps)

27:52.505 --> 27:54.171
It's not her.

27:54.398 --> 27:57.582
(gasps)
It's not her.

27:57.735 --> 27:59.418
What?

27:59.512 --> 28:02.137
That's not our daughter.

28:03.165 --> 28:05.665
TOMMY:
That's Makayla.

28:05.759 --> 28:07.976
(crying)

28:11.098 --> 28:13.607
TOMMY:
That's Makayla.

28:19.924 --> 28:21.940
Hey, Claudette,
do you have a minute?

28:22.092 --> 28:24.702
I got to get home
and feed my cat.

28:24.853 --> 28:26.261
You have a cat?

28:26.280 --> 28:28.447
No.

28:28.599 --> 28:31.357
So I feel like
we got off on the wrong foot.

28:31.377 --> 28:34.603
-Oh?
-Yeah. I mean,
what happened today?

28:34.621 --> 28:36.605
What happened today
was a learning opportunity.

28:36.623 --> 28:39.532
Yes. Exactly. I'm so glad
you see it that way.

28:39.626 --> 28:42.611
I mean, I know you're a lot more
experienced at this than I am.

28:42.704 --> 28:44.463
-I know I look young, and I am.
-(laughs)

28:44.615 --> 28:46.465
But I'm also good at this,
and I've been trained

28:46.559 --> 28:47.966
by some very talented
dispatchers,

28:48.060 --> 28:50.118
and I've learned important
things from all of them.

28:50.137 --> 28:52.396
And when I make a mistake,
it's usually just once.

28:52.623 --> 28:54.380
I learn from it.

28:54.475 --> 28:57.050
-(elevator bell dings)
-Apology accepted.

28:57.069 --> 29:00.295
-No. Um...
-Oh, and next time,

29:00.388 --> 29:02.406
you don't have to tell me
how good you are.

29:02.633 --> 29:04.466
Just show me.

29:04.559 --> 29:06.285
Good night.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.913
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

29:10.065 --> 29:13.325
Hey, thank you for doing that.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.068
-How did it go?
-It's a complicated question.

29:15.162 --> 29:16.328
Where are the Tannors?

29:16.422 --> 29:18.464
They're in with their daughter.

29:18.573 --> 29:19.831
Except they're not.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.009
What do you mean?

29:24.930 --> 29:27.097
Bobby?

29:30.160 --> 29:32.436
(phone vibrates)

29:32.663 --> 29:35.272
Hey. I'm sorry.
I'm still at work.

29:35.499 --> 29:37.423
I saw the news
about the parade. You all right?

29:37.443 --> 29:40.277
Yeah, I just have an insane
amount of paperwork to finish.

29:40.428 --> 29:42.112
<i> How about you?</i>
<i> How did today go with Harry?</i>

29:42.264 --> 29:44.356
(sighs)
It's a process.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.225
<i> I sure could use sinking</i>
<i> into the arms of my man.</i>

29:47.286 --> 29:48.786
I will bring them home to you
as soon as I can.

29:49.013 --> 29:52.039
-(chuckles)
<i> -I'll see you soon.</i>

29:59.373 --> 30:01.507
Oh.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.593
(clears throat)

30:35.909 --> 30:37.334
(sighs)

31:00.100 --> 31:02.693
Dental records confirmed it.
You were right.

31:02.844 --> 31:05.845
The girl in the morgue is
Makayla Tannor, not Cassie Shaw.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.589
Oh, God.

31:07.608 --> 31:10.775
The Tannors are in there now
with the Shaw's daughter,

31:10.870 --> 31:12.035
thinking it's theirs.

31:12.262 --> 31:13.519
I'm going
to break it to them now.

31:13.539 --> 31:16.615
Actually, would it be okay
if I told them?

31:16.767 --> 31:20.460
Hen.
Are you sure?

31:21.196 --> 31:23.755
I think I owe them that.

31:32.725 --> 31:35.100
(monitor beeping steadily)

31:36.620 --> 31:39.471
-(knocking)
-Mr. and Mrs. Tannor?

31:39.623 --> 31:40.956
Please, come on in.

31:40.974 --> 31:42.399
It-it might be best if we, uh...

31:42.626 --> 31:44.610
if we speak in the hall.

31:49.983 --> 31:52.367
ELLEN:
We'll be right
outside that door.

31:59.476 --> 32:02.068
I, um...

32:02.087 --> 32:03.662
I... (sighs)

32:03.814 --> 32:07.666
I-I have no idea
how to even... tell you this.

32:07.818 --> 32:10.335
What? Is there something wrong
with one of her tests?

32:10.487 --> 32:13.672
No. Uh...

32:13.766 --> 32:16.174
we made a terrible mistake.
I...

32:16.268 --> 32:18.718
I made a terrible mistake.

32:18.829 --> 32:22.588
The girl in there, when-when
I... when I asked her her name,

32:22.683 --> 32:25.359
she kept saying "Makayla."

32:27.504 --> 32:30.781
But she wasn't
telling me her name.

32:30.932 --> 32:32.449
She was...

32:32.600 --> 32:34.859
she was only thinking
about her friend.

32:35.012 --> 32:37.012
-And so, we just assumed...
-JACK: Wait.

32:37.105 --> 32:38.956
Wait. Are-are you telling us

32:39.107 --> 32:42.000
the girl in this room
is not our daughter?

32:43.462 --> 32:47.447
Mr. And Mrs. Tannor, I'm-I'm
so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.616
Makayla succumbed
to her injuries at the scene.

32:50.711 --> 32:54.137
-No. No.
-The girl in the room
is Cassie Shaw.

32:54.364 --> 32:56.598
-Your daughter is downstairs.
-No.

32:58.460 --> 33:02.204

Maddie took Jee-Yun
to the emergency room.

34:31.553 --> 34:33.144
Uh, o-okay.

34:33.297 --> 34:35.555
It was during the blackout.
There was some kind of accident.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.742
Maddie was bathing her and the
baby slipped under the water.

34:38.893 --> 34:40.302
That's what she meant
when she said

34:40.395 --> 34:41.727
Jee-Yun wasn't safe with her.

34:41.822 --> 34:45.140
-But Jee-Yun is fine.
-Yes, exactly, she's fine.

34:45.158 --> 34:47.642
But Maddie is out there
somewhere, beating herself up

34:47.661 --> 34:50.495
because she lost grip
of a slippery child.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.314
She needs to know that
this wasn't her fault.

34:52.332 --> 34:56.318
And she'll figure that out
if you give her time.

34:56.336 --> 34:59.596
Time? She needs me.
I'm going after her.

34:59.823 --> 35:02.582
Well, sh-she said sh-she didn't
want you to do that, right?

35:02.676 --> 35:04.342
Buck, you're not listening.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.178
She exiled herself
because she thinks

35:07.272 --> 35:09.164
she's a danger to the baby.

35:09.257 --> 35:10.774
I can't leave her alone
like that, believing that,

35:10.925 --> 35:13.259
thinking the worst of herself.
She needs to know.

35:13.353 --> 35:15.445
Know what?
That you love her?

35:15.672 --> 35:19.007
That you support her?
Chim, she knows.

35:19.100 --> 35:22.101
What she needs is time,

35:22.195 --> 35:25.122
and she will come home.

35:27.108 --> 35:30.085
Why weren't you surprised?

35:33.114 --> 35:35.948
When I told you
that Jee-Yun almost drowned,

35:35.968 --> 35:37.709
you didn't even blink.

35:37.803 --> 35:41.471
It wasn't until I said that
I was going after Maddie...

35:42.532 --> 35:45.291
Did you know?

35:46.127 --> 35:48.645
-Ch-Chim, Chimney...
-She told you? Is that it?

35:48.796 --> 35:52.131
She called you and you
already knew about this

35:52.225 --> 35:54.609
because she told you?

35:57.564 --> 35:58.971
Where is she, Buck?

35:59.065 --> 36:01.216
I-I... I don't know.

36:01.234 --> 36:04.310
-She wouldn't tell me.
-Eight... days.

36:04.329 --> 36:07.071
You have waited eight days

36:07.224 --> 36:08.573
while you have seen the hell

36:08.725 --> 36:10.225
I've been going through,
and you didn't tell me?

36:10.243 --> 36:12.151
She-she said
she was fine, you know?

36:12.171 --> 36:13.819
She-she just needed
to figure some stuff out.

36:13.914 --> 36:16.731
And she-she was
more worried about you.

36:16.750 --> 36:18.416
She-she asked me to check in
on you and Jee-Yun

36:18.568 --> 36:20.343
and make sure that you're okay.

36:20.495 --> 36:22.971
(grunts, sighs)

36:25.350 --> 36:28.727
I am not okay.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.838
(door opens)

36:32.933 --> 36:35.108
(door closes)

36:36.028 --> 36:38.445
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

36:39.347 --> 36:41.489
Athena?

36:42.350 --> 36:45.118
Athena?

36:47.948 --> 36:49.539
-Athena. Hey.
-Oh.

36:49.691 --> 36:51.875
-(vacuum turns off)
-Sorry. Didn't hear you come in.

36:52.102 --> 36:55.587
It's all right.
Looks like you've been busy.

36:56.456 --> 36:57.714
What happened?

36:58.884 --> 37:00.866
He was in our house.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.944
I know.

37:02.963 --> 37:05.964
This is the house where...

37:06.058 --> 37:07.557
where my babies grew up,

37:07.784 --> 37:11.478
where they said their first
words, took their first steps.

37:12.731 --> 37:15.106
(sighs)
This patio...

37:16.626 --> 37:17.625
...was full of memories

37:17.644 --> 37:21.629
of barbecues
and birthday parties.

37:21.723 --> 37:23.907
And now it's the place
where that man came in

37:24.134 --> 37:26.058
and snatched my son!

37:26.078 --> 37:27.727
He's gone now.

37:27.821 --> 37:29.362
He can't
hurt this family anymore.

37:29.473 --> 37:32.082
I'm supposed
to bring Harry back here,

37:32.233 --> 37:34.233
tell him he's safe,

37:34.327 --> 37:38.162
that this is still his home.

37:38.315 --> 37:40.632
How do I do that...

37:41.985 --> 37:44.410
...when I'm not sure
it'll ever feel like

37:44.429 --> 37:46.513
home again?

37:49.342 --> 37:51.685
-(crying)
-Hey, hey, come here.

37:55.774 --> 37:58.333
<i> EDDIE:</i>
<i> Well, there's nothing wrong</i>
<i> with his aim.</i>

37:58.426 --> 38:00.426
Ah.

38:00.520 --> 38:02.520
He got you good.

38:03.673 --> 38:07.266
Look, I get why he's mad.
What am I supposed to do?

38:07.286 --> 38:09.360
She begged me
not to tell him we talked.

38:09.454 --> 38:12.289
-She's your sister.
-Thought I could help them both.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.516
Could, uh, convince her
to come home

38:14.534 --> 38:17.443
and stop him
from spiraling out of control.

38:17.462 --> 38:21.113
-Mm.
-Kind of feels like
I failed on both fronts.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.191
You were always gonna fail.

38:23.209 --> 38:25.026
Well, that's dark.

38:25.119 --> 38:27.045
Look, you love Maddie,

38:27.139 --> 38:28.863
and you love Chimney,

38:28.956 --> 38:32.550
and you're the guy
who likes to fix things.

38:32.702 --> 38:34.644
But maybe this isn't
something you can fix.

38:34.796 --> 38:37.147
He-he kept on saying that, you
know, she could be in trouble,

38:37.298 --> 38:39.015
she needs our help.

38:39.167 --> 38:41.651
But I know she's gonna be okay.

38:42.546 --> 38:44.470
He just doesn't know her
the way I do.

38:44.489 --> 38:47.657
Or you don't know her
the way he does.

38:47.809 --> 38:49.308
When you think of your sister,

38:49.328 --> 38:51.736
you see this person
you've always looked up to.

38:51.888 --> 38:54.497
The woman
who's taken care of you.

38:54.649 --> 38:57.316
But maybe that's not
who she is right now. This time,

38:57.336 --> 39:00.628
maybe she's the one
who needs taking care of.

39:05.068 --> 39:06.918
You think he's gonna forgive me?

39:07.070 --> 39:08.570
No.

39:08.663 --> 39:12.073
Kidding.
I'm kidding.

39:12.166 --> 39:14.425
-Maybe.
-(laughs)

39:14.578 --> 39:17.354
-Ice goes on the eye, bud.
-Okay, I got it.

39:17.505 --> 39:20.482
(groans)

39:21.193 --> 39:22.876
Hey, just don't tell Dad.

39:22.878 --> 39:25.362
He'll freak about how much sugar
I'm giving you right now.

39:25.513 --> 39:28.180
-He won't care.
-Since when?

39:28.200 --> 39:30.425
Since I got kidnapped
by a crazy freak.

39:31.261 --> 39:33.519
Look, this ice cream's
not just for you.

39:33.613 --> 39:35.947
I had a pretty crappy day
at work yesterday.

39:36.099 --> 39:38.708
A new dispatcher.
Old dispatcher, really.

39:38.860 --> 39:40.526
I think she has it in for me.

39:40.620 --> 39:42.361
-She was really getting
on my nerves.
-That's my job.

39:42.455 --> 39:44.363
Well, you haven't been talking.

39:44.457 --> 39:46.124
So I guess
someone else felt like

39:46.276 --> 39:49.444
they needed
to pick up the slack.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.630
Mom and Dad
won't stop hovering.

39:52.757 --> 39:54.298
"What are you watching?"
"What are you reading?"

39:54.451 --> 39:55.950
Pretending like
they're not checking in

39:55.969 --> 39:57.227
on my damaged mental state.

39:57.378 --> 39:59.062
You were already pretty damaged.

39:59.289 --> 40:01.456
Hey, I just...
They're worried, okay?

40:01.474 --> 40:04.308
They probably feel a little
guilty that it happened.

40:04.461 --> 40:07.070
Yeah, well, they should.
Dad was standing right there,

40:07.297 --> 40:09.647
and he didn't even notice
the guy walking off with me.

40:09.799 --> 40:11.482
And Mom...

40:11.576 --> 40:13.801
She was the reason
the guy was there.

40:14.562 --> 40:16.913
I know I'm not supposed
to be mad at them, but...

40:17.064 --> 40:20.141
Hey, no. Be mad at them,
if that's how you feel.

40:20.234 --> 40:22.143
Just don't
bottle up your emotions

40:22.162 --> 40:23.811
and put on a happy face
for other people.

40:23.905 --> 40:26.664
That never works, and it will
never make you feel better.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.407
Okay.

40:28.501 --> 40:31.911
Tell me how nice you were
to that mean lady at work.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.838
Way too nice.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.916
Yeah?
Well, there's always tomorrow.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.602
Yeah, there is.

40:42.182 --> 40:44.441
There you go.

40:44.668 --> 40:49.020
Need anything else? Game device?
Pretzels? Magazine?

40:49.172 --> 40:52.690
All right.
Let's go find Mommy.

40:52.784 --> 40:56.435
Just make one quick stop first.

40:56.529 --> 40:58.938
(door beeping)

40:58.957 --> 41:00.940
(line ringing)

41:00.959 --> 41:02.942
(sighs)

41:02.961 --> 41:05.128
(phone ringing)

41:05.279 --> 41:07.464
Seriously, Chimney?

41:07.691 --> 41:10.166
You were gonna call me
on your way out of town?

41:10.393 --> 41:12.710
Or leave you
a heartfelt voice mail.

41:12.804 --> 41:16.047
Actually, I was calling to see
if we could come by right now.

41:16.199 --> 41:18.123
-You're really doing this.
-I'm really doing it.

41:18.218 --> 41:20.459
You're not here to try
and talk me out of it, are you?

41:20.479 --> 41:23.888
Hell, no. I'm here to see
if you wanted a driving partner.

41:24.649 --> 41:27.299
What would your wife
have to say about that?

41:27.393 --> 41:28.818
(chuckles)

41:28.970 --> 41:31.020
After yesterday,
I think she'd understand.

41:31.172 --> 41:32.972
Yeah.
Eddie told me about that.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.232
So many life lessons.

41:34.326 --> 41:37.068
They just keep coming,
don't they?

41:37.162 --> 41:39.204
(laughs)
I'd like to go just a few days

41:39.389 --> 41:41.906
without learning anything,
anything at all.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.058
Right?
(laughs)

41:44.077 --> 41:46.911
So do you even know
where you're going?

41:47.063 --> 41:50.823
Nope. I know
that she made a withdrawal

41:50.917 --> 41:52.157
from some bank in Oxnard.

41:52.177 --> 41:53.584
I thought I'd start there.

41:53.737 --> 41:54.844
Oxnard.
(laughs)

41:54.996 --> 41:58.831
Some really,
really important journeys

41:58.850 --> 42:00.424
start there, don't they?

42:00.519 --> 42:02.744
Yeah, I heard that.

42:02.762 --> 42:05.563
(sighs)

42:08.342 --> 42:10.485
Are you sure you're coming back?

42:11.863 --> 42:13.488
Not without her.

42:14.591 --> 42:15.865
Then you go find her.

42:16.017 --> 42:18.326
You go find her.

42:26.953 --> 42:28.402
(clears throat)

42:28.404 --> 42:29.879
Be safe, okay?

42:30.031 --> 42:33.699
-(chuckles) Hey, you know me.
-(laughs)

42:33.718 --> 42:36.261
I do.
Hence the request,

42:37.538 --> 42:39.639
rebar-skull.

42:41.893 --> 42:44.985
Karen's a lucky woman.

42:44.987 --> 42:46.521
So's Maddie.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.733
Let's hope she sees it that way.

42:52.462 --> 42:55.572
